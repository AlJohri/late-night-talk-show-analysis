WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE  GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE  OF NEW JERSEY PLEASE WELCOME  TO THE PROGRAM GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE. (APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. HOW YOU HAVE BEEN?
ARE YOU GETTING ANY REST  AT ALL?
YEAH, STARTED TO LAST  WEEK A LITTLE BIT AFTER  THANKSGIVING, I TRIED TO GET A LITTLE MORE STREET, A  COUPLE DAYS OFF.
Jon: YOU AND I MAY NOT  AGREE ON EVERYTHING BUT I  THINK WE BOTH, TWO THINGS WE VERY MUCH AGREE ON. WE BOTH CAN'T WAIT AND KNOW  THAT OUR GREAT STATE OF NEW  JERSEY IS GOING TO BOUNCE BACK STRONGER THAN EVER,  GOING TO REBUILD.
ABSOLUTELY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: AND WE BOTH WOULD  VERY MUCH LIKE BRUCE  SPRINGSTEEN TO HUG US.
YEAH, HE DID HUG ME  RECENTLY.
Jon: DE REALLY.
YEAH, WHEN WE WERE AT THE  TELETHON.
Jon: OH, THE TELETHON.
THAT NBC HAD. YOU KNOW, I WAS ON THE STAGE  AFTERWARD TALKING TO STEVE  VAN ZANDT AND MAX WEINBERG AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY  WERE LOOKING BEHIND MOW AND  THEY MOVED AWAY. AND STOPPED TALKING. SO I TURNED AROUND. THERE HE WAS.
Jon: AND THERE HE WAS.
THERE HE WAS. AN HE CAME UP AND PUT HIS  HAND OUT. AND SO I SHOOK HIS HAND. I TRIED TO BE COOL. I WASN'T. AND THEN HE SAID COME ON,  GIVE ME A HUG. AND I SAID ALL RIGHT. AND I HUGGED HIM. AND-- .
Jon: GO HE -- DID HE GO  COME ON, STOP, LET ME GO.
NO, I WAS-- YOU KNOW THAT  IS ALWAYS HARD TO JUDGE,  RIGHT, WHEN DOW STOP THE MAN HUG, IT'S HARD.
Jon: YOU GOT TO GIVE ALSO  THIS, THE PAT, OR DID YOU  JUST GO SLOW DANCE.
NO I WENT SLOW DANCE.
Jon: YOU GOT TO BE  KIDDING ME.
I Z I WHEN SLOW DANCE.
Jon: NO PAT.
NO PAT, I WENT SLOW  DANCE. BUT, BUT THEN HE SAID THE  MOST AMAZING THING TO ME. HE SAID IT'S OFFICIAL, WE'RE  FRIENDS.
Jon: OH, WOW. THAT'S NICE. (APPLAUSE)
YEAH.
Jon: THAT'S NICE. I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE,  THOUGH, JON, I'M LOOKING FOR  A LITTLE MORE NOW.
Jon: REALLY?
YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH IT  STICKS IN YOUR HEAD, YOU  CONDITION STOP THINKING ABOUT IT, 132 SHOWS, I MEAN.
Jon: TODAY THOUGH YOU  WERE DOWN IN DC, TRYING TO  GET SOME MONEY FROM THESE  GUYS.
YUP.
Jon: TO HELP JERSEY. WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH  DOWN THERE? ARE THEY COMING UP WITH SOME  RELIEF.
YEAH, I THINK THEY WILL. YOU KNOW, IT'S A TYPICAL  THING THAT GOES ON. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE  NUMBERS AND HOW MUCH AND WE  PUT OUR NUMBER OUT THERE. AND TRY TO CONVINCE THE  PRESIDENT AND THE CONGRESS  THAT THEY NEED TO COME  THROUGH WITH THIS AND COME THROUGH WITH IT QUICKLY  BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE  PEOPLE SUFFERING.
Jon: STILL.
AND WE NEED TO GET THEM  BACK TO WORK.
I DONE KNOW, THE SCOPE OF  THIS THING TRULY WAS LIKE  SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE ON COMPREHENDED  COULD OCCUR IN THAT AREA,  FROM DOWN IN SOUTHERN JERSEY ALL THE WAY UP STATEN ISLAND,  THE WHOLE AREA, UTTERLY  DEVASTATED. >>IT IS INCREDIBLE. I KNOW, WHEN I WENT OUT THE  DAY AFTER THE STORM AND  FIRST WE COULDN'T LAND. WE HAD TO DO IT BY AIR. I MEAN I JUST SAW THINGS  DESTROYED THAT I-- YOU GET  DISORIENTED BECAUSE AS YOU  KNOW ABOUT THE SHORE THERE ARE CERTAIN KIND OF ICONIC  THINGS ON THE SHORE THAT  HELP YOU TO ORIENT. AND SOME OF OF THAT WAS  GONE. NOT LIKE JUST DESTROYED IT  WAS GONE. THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS  WHERE I DIDN'T KNOW, THE  ONLY REASON I KNEW THERE HAD BEEN A HOUSE THERE WAS THE  IN THE GROUND POOL WAS STILL  THERE. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT  OF THE HOME ITSELF. IT WAS ALL GONE.
Jon: PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE  THIS, THERE ARE, WHEN YOU  LOOK AT THAT ROW ON THE OCEAN THERE ARE REALLY NICE  HOUSES THERE BUT THESE ARE  WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES. BY THE BAYS THERE, INLAND A  LITTLE BIT, UNION BEACH,  THESE ARE WORKING  COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO REBUILD AND NEED THE MONEY. THIS ISN'T JUST MILLIONAIRES  OR SECOND HOMES AND THAT  TYPE OF THING.
DEFINITELY NOT. IN FACT I WAS TELLING THE  FOLKS IN WASHINGTON TODAY  THAT THE HOMES THAT WERE  DAMAGED OR DESTROYED, 80% OF THEM WERE THE PERSON'S SOLE  RESIDENCE. AND SO PEOPLE THINK IT'S  LIKE THE MILLIONAIRE HOMES  ON THE BEACH. BUT REALLY MOST OF THE FOLKS  ARE THIS IS WHERE THEY LIVE  EVERY DAY THIS IS WHERE THEIR KID GOES TO SCHOOL. THIS IS WHERE THEY'RE  RETIRED TOO.
Jon: SO YOU ARE IN A  WEIRD SPOT. BECAUSE YOU'RE A GUY, SO YOU  ARE DOWN THERE, ARE YOU  ASKING FOR MONEY. THE SAME DAY THE LEGISLATURE  IN NEW JERSEY THEY ASK IF  NEW JERSEY IS GOING TO DO AN OBAMACARE EXCHANGE.
YEAH.
Jon: SO YOU'RE DOWN  TALKING TO THE PRESIDENT  WHILE IN YOUR STATE THEY'RE SAYING ARE YOU GOING TO DO  ONE OF THOSE STATE EXCHANGES. YOU WANT MONEY FROM HIM BUT  DOWN HERE YOU VETOED THE  EXCHANGE. GO HE KNOW ABOUT THAT? DE SAY LIKE MAYBE I'LL THROW  IN ANOTHER BILLION  LIKE-- WHAT KIND OF-- WHAT  KIND OF HORSE TRADING ARE WE TALKING ABOUT.
NO, NO, HE DIDN'T. LISTEN, I THINK HE  UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE  ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF  ISSUES. AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE  SOME THAT WE AGREE ON AND  SOME WE DON'T. BUT WE GOT TO WORK TOGETHER. AND I THINK WHAT HE CARES  ABOUT MOST IS THAT WHEN YOU  SIT ACROSS FROM HIM AND  TRYING TO TALK TO HIM, YOU REASON WITH HIM, AND YOU BE  FAIR. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE TRIED  TO DO THROUGH THE STORM. AND NOT PLAY POLITICS AND  JUST PLAY IT STRAIGHT AND  FAIR.
Jon: SEE THAT'S THE STORM,  ANY TIME AN EVENT LIKE THIS,  IT'S HUMBLING. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE  POLITICAL GAME WAS FAR MORE  VITRIOLIC AND FAR MORE  HYPERBOLIC WELL WE HAD SOME FUN WITH YOU, THE WOKE  BEFORE THE STORM YOU WERE  OUT THERE, PRESIDENT OBAMA  COULDN'T LEAD HIS WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG WAY FISTFUL OF  20s. AND THEN RIGHT AFTER THE  STORM WAS OVER YOU WERE LIKE  THIS MAN IS THE LEADER. HE IS-- LIKE DOESN'T THAT --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: .
Jon: DOESN'T THAT TELL  YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE  GAME.
WHAT IT TELLS ME IS THAT  PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT SKILL  SETS AT DIFFERENT TIMES. S THIS'S WHAT IT TELLS ME.
Jon: I SEE. SO HE WASN'T A LEADER UNTIL  YOU NEEDED LEADERSHIP.
MAYBE, MAYBE UNTIL HE WAS  PRESENTED WITH A STARK  OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, FAIR  ENOUGH. WE'LL GET INTO THAT BECAUSE  THAT IS A GOOD PHILOSOPHICAL  DISCUSSION TO HAVE. WE'LL COME BACK. ONE MORE WITH GOVERNOR CHRIS  CHRISTIE WHEN WE COME RIGHT  BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
