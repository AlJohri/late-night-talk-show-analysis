Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A BEST SELLING AUTHOR. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE DIVIDE: AMERICAN INJUSTICE IN THE AGE OF THE WEALTH GAP. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM MATT TAIBBI. YOUNG MAN, COME AND SIT, ENJOY. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOUR HAVING ME.
Jon: THIS BOOK IS EXCELLENT. IT'S FASCINATING TO ME.
IF YOU SAY SO.
Jon: HAVE YOU READ IT? YOU SHOULD READ IT. IT'S QUITE GOOD. IT'S GOT A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE ON IT. YOU SHOULD READ IT. YOU KNOW,  WE TALK ABOUT THE WEALTH GAP AND PEOPLE LOOK AT IF FROM A TAXATION POINT OR AN INCOME DISTRIBUTION POINT YOU ARE LOOKING AT IT FROM A LEGAL SYSTEM ELEMENT WHICH IS A SURPRISING DIRECTION TO TAKE ON IT. WHY THAT TAKE?
WELL, LOOK PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE INCOME INEQUALITY GAP ALL THE TIME BUT FOR THE MOST PART WHEN POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT IT'S JUST A STATISTIC. BUT WHAT I'VE FOUND IS THAT THERE'S THIS PROFOUND DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY WE PROSECUTE CRIME FOR THE VERY WEALTHY, AND PARTICULARLY THESE PEOPLE IN THESE TOO BIG TOO FAIL EVIL BANKS THAT WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT. AND THEN EVERYBODY ELSE. THERE'S THIS ENORMOUS DELTA AND WE NEVER TALK ABOUT IT. THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO IN THIS BOOK IS JUST TALK ABOUT THIS. THIS REALLY GREW OUT OF MY EXPERIENCE COVERING FINANCIAL CRIME FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. WHEN I STARTED I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. I COULDN'T EVEN BALANCE MY OWN CHECKBOOK.
Jon: NOT A CRIME.
NOT A CRIME, NO.
Jon: FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND.
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO UNDERSTAND. I TRIED TO READ ALL THESE BOOKS, THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, ECONOMIC TEXT BOOKS. IT WASN'T UNTIL I READ LIKE A LITTLE THING THAT WAS LIKE THE GREAT CONMEN IN HISTORY THAT I -- IT DAWNED ON ME IT'S JUST STEALING. THAT'S ALL THIS IS. IT'S JUST STEALING.
Jon: THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STEALING THAT APPEARS TO BE BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM AS AN ACCEPTABLE VIG FOR THE GOOD THAT THEY DO, THE WEALTH THAT THEY SPREAD.
BUT THERE IS NO -- AGAIN, THAT'S THE ILLUSION. THERE'S NO GREATER GOOD. THIS IS JUST TAKING STUFF FROM PEOPLE. THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS ALL IT WAS WAS BANKS ROBBING OLD LADIES. IT WAS THE SAME THING. YOU MIGHT HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE WHO CALL UP THE ELDERLY AND TRY TO SELL THEM PHONY SUBSCRIPTIONS OVER THE TELEPHONE.
Jon: CORRECT.
THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE THING WAS THE SAME THING. PHONY MORTGAGES. THEY WERE SELLING IT TO PENSION FUNDS AND THEY WERE RIPPING PEOPLE OFF.
Jon: THIS GETS US TO THE GREAT PREMISE IN THE BOOK WHICH IS, IF THE OLD LADY. IF YOUR GRANDMOTHER WENT INTO A BANK AND RIPPED THEM OFF. SAID GIVE ME YOUR MONEY AND THEY GAVE IT TO HER AND SHE WALKED OUT CHANCES ARE THAT WOULD CARRY A CRIMINAL PENALTY?
ABSOLUTELY, YES.
FOR SOME REASON THE WHITE COLLAR RIPOFF HAS BEEN DECRIMINALIZED TO SOME EXTENT EXCEPT FOR FINES.
EXACTLY.
Jon: AND NOT ON THE INDIVIDUAL BASIS BUT ON THE LARGER CORPORATE LEVEL.
RIGHT, AND THIS IS WHAT I WAS REALLY TRYING TO GET TO IN THE BOOK. THERE'S THIS REALLY KIND OF SCARY PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENT THAT WE'VE CROSSED IN AMERICA WHERE WE NO LONGER THINK OF A CERTAIN KIND OF OFFENDER AS APPROPRIATE FOR JAIL. I HAD THIS REALLY EYE-OPENING -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THAT'S SUCH A GREAT PHRASE THIS MAN IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR JAIL.
I'VE HEARD THAT SAID TO ME HONESTLY. I WAS TALKING TO A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR A FEW YEARS AGO AND I SAID LOOK THESE PEOPLE STOLE A BILLION DOLLARS. I WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS BANK. HOW ARE THESE GUYS NOT JAIL? HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE? AND HE SAYS TO ME, HAVE YOU BEEN TO A JAIL? JAILS ARE DANGEROUS. [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE GET STABBED IN JAIL.
Jon: YEAH.
I'M LIKE I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH YOU BUT THERE'S TWO AND A HALF MILLION OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO IN THAT SAME PLACE AND THEY DID A LOT LESS THAN STEAL A COUPLE OF BILLION DOLLARS, AND IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL THING WHERE I THINK MEMBERS OF A CERTAIN CLASS JUST DO NOT SEE PEOPLE WHO RUN BANKS AND WHO HAVE TIES AND DRIVE MASERATIS.
Jon: THESE ARE NOT BAD PEOPLE. THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TAKING ADVANTAGE OF RULES THAT MAYBE THEY ALSO WROTE BUT STILL.
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
Jon: IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS CRIMINAL. BUT EVEN WHEN IT CLEARS INTO AN AREA THAT IS SO MORE CLEARLY CRIMINAL. I THINK THE HSBC CASE IS THE GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS. THEY ADMITTED TO LAUNDERING MONEY FOR NARCO TERRORISTS.
RIGHT, RIGHT. $850 MILLION.
Jon: AND THEY SAID, YES.
OH, YOU GOT US.
Jon: WE DID DO THAT.
WE DID DO THAT.
Jon: AND THEIR PENALTY WAS WHAT?
THEY GOT A COMPLETE AND TOTAL WALK. IT WAS A DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT. NOT ONE PERSON DID ONE DAY IN JAIL. NO INDIVIDUAL TO HAD TO PAY ANY FINES. THERE WAS A COMPANY FINE OF $1.9 BILLION WHICH WAS AT THE TIME A RECORD. THAT VERY SAME DAY WHEN THEY MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WAS VERY PROUD AFTER THIS DEAL. IT WASN'T LIKE WE DIDN'T GET ANY JAIL TIME FOR THESE GUYS THEY WERE LIKE WE GOT $1.9 BILLION. AREN'T WE AWESOME? I WENT DOWN TO THE COURTS THAT DAY AND ASKED AROUND ASKING WHAT IS THE DUMBEST DRUG CASE YOU'VE HAD TODAY? THEY FOUND A GUY FOR ME THAT HAD BEEN CAUGHT WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH A JOINT IN HIS POCKET WHO GOT 47 DAYS AT RIKERS. THAT'S WORSE THAN ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO ANYBODY AT HSBC AND THEY ARE AT THE TOP OF THE ILLEGAL DRUGS PYRAMID. AND THIS GUY IS AT THE BOTTOM AND HE'S DOING A MUCH MORE SEVERE SENTENCE. THAT JUST CAN'T BE RIGHT. THERE'S NO WAY TO LOOK AT THAT AND HAVE THAT BE RIGHT.
Jon: NO AND WHAT I THOUGHT IS VERY INTERESTING ABOUT THE BOOK IS YOU TIE -- THIS IS SYSTEMIC FROM THE TOP, FROM THE HEAD LEGAL AUTHORITY IN THIS COUNTRY, ERIC HOLDER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THIS IS NOT A BUG IN THE SYSTEM THIS IS A FEATURE OF THE SYSTEM.
RIGHT, THIS IS A -- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. ERIC HOLDER WAY BACK IN THE CLINTON YEARS WHEN HE WAS JUST A REGULAR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL, HE WROTE THIS MEMO AND IT'S COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE HOLDER MEMO. HE OUTLINED THIS POLICY CALLED THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES POLICY. AND WHAT THAT BASICALLY  MEANS IS IF DEALING WITH A BIG COMPANY THAT EMPLOYS A LOT OF PEOPLE AND IF YOU PROSECUTE IT, BAD THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN TO INNOCENT PEOPLE. YOU CAN SEEK OTHER REMEDIES, YOU CAN DO FINES, DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRECK THE WHOLE THING IF GOING TO DO THAT.
Jon: SURE.
THAT'S SENSIBLE. YOU DON'T WANT TO DESTROY A COMPANY JUST BECAUSE A FEW BAD APPLES OF THE COMPANY MAY HAVE
Jon: MAY HAVE LAUNDERED NARCO TERRORIST MONEY. EXACTLY.
YEAH IN THE CASE OF ENRON THEY MAY HAVE SHREDDED TWO TONS OF DOCUMENTS.
BUT, IT HAPPENS.
Jon: BUT IT HAPPENS  IT'S A MESSAGE ON THAT KID WITH THE JOINT IN HIS POCKET IT SAYS TO HIM, GO BIG OR GO HOME.
RIGHT. RIGHT.  STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT. THE DIVIDE IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE MORE WITH MATT TAIBBI RIGHT AFTER THIS ON THE INTERNETS, I THINK. YES. WE'LL DO IT.
