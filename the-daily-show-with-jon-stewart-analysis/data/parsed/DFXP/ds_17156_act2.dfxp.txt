Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF  TALK IN THIS COUNTRY ABOUT  PEOPLE PICKING THEMSELVES UP BY  THEIR BOOT STRAOPS TO BETTER THEIR LIVES AND FIGHT THEIR WAY  INTO THE 1%. BUT IS IT WORTH THE COST? JASON JONES HAS MORE.
AMONGST ALL THE TERRIBLE NEWS  ABOUT PEOPLE WHO'VE LOST THEIR  JOBS OR THEIR HOMES THERE'S BEEN ONE GROUP THAT'S BEEN  OVERLOOKED-- THE EXTREMELY  WEALTHY. LUCKILY, PSYCHOLOGIST DR. STEVEN  GOLDBERG AND PSYCHOTHERAPIST  JOAN DEFURIA HAS BEEN THERE TO  HELP.
AVERAGE CLIENT IS $25 AND $50  MILLION AND UP. PEOPLE COME TO US WHEN THEY  DON'T HAVE TO WORK ANOTHER DAY  IN THEIR LIVES.
SO WHY DO THEY HAVE PROBLEMS? (LAUGHTER)
I KNOW IT SOUNDS VERY ODD BUT  THE CLIMATE TODAY IS VERY  DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS  AGO.
WE'RE REALLY ANGRY AT THE  HAVES RIGHT NOW.
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE  OF THAT HAVE IS THE WEALTHY END  UP HIDING THEMSELVES IN THESE  GATED COMMUNITIES.
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THESE  PEOPLE I JUST FEEL BAD AND I  JUST--  (LAUGHTER). -- WANT TO PUNCH THEM IN THE  (BLEEP)ING FACE.
THE WEALTHY ARE PEOPLE, TOO.
FROM THE TRUST BELT IN  CONNECTICUT TO THE TECH GET CO-S  OF SILICON VALLEY, THE RICH ARE  BEING UNFAIRLY VILIFIED BUT AT THE MONEY MEANING AND CHOICES  INSTITUTE HAS IDENTIFIED A MORE  SERIOUS PROBLEM.
WE COINED THE PHRASE SUDDEN  WEALTH SYNDROME.
SUDDEN WEALTH SYNDROME?
IT DESCRIBES THE  PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES AND SIN  TOMS THAT MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE  AS A CONSEQUENCE OF COMING INTO NEW OR SUDDEN PROBLEMS.
THEY HAVE PROBLEMS, THAT'S  WHY WE COINED THE TERM S.W.S.
IF YOU CONTRACTED S.W.S.,  COULD THAT LEAN TO FULL BLOWN  R.B.S.?
WHAT'S THAT?
RESTLESS BUTLER SYNDROME.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BITE.
SORRY, MAKING UP A CONDITION  AND GIVING IT AN ACRONYM TO MAKE  IT SOUND LEGITIMATE IS FOOLISH. SORRY, YOU WERE SAYING, S.W.S. SURE THE POOR AND MIDDLE-CLASS  ARE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING ENOUGH  FOOD. BUT THE WEALTHY HAVE TO WORRY  ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEIR  WAITER IS RECORDING THEM WHILE  THEY MOCK HALF THE COUNTRY. IT'S A PAINFUL REALITY THAT  AFFLICTS AT LEAST 1% OF THE 1%. SO LET'S SAY I'VE CREATED A HOT  NEW APP.
RIGHT.
IT'S CALLED DICK WIDGET.
OKAY.
NOW I'M WORTH $100 MILLION. CAN YOU HELP HE?
WELL, WE BEGIN BY ASKING YOU  WHAT--
A DICK WIDGET IS--
NO, I DON'T CARE WHAT A DICK  WIDGET IS.
IT'S AN APP THAT DRAWS  (BLEEP) ON PEOPLE'S FACES.
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU  MADE YOUR MONEY. YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT LUCKY.
NOT REALLY, DICK WIDGET WAS  POPULAR.
BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS  OF THE BUSINESS. WE NEED TO KNOW WHY IT IS YOU'RE  COMING TO US.
YOU TELL ME, YOU'RE THE  SHRINKS.
WHAT ARE THE NEEDS AND WANTS  THAT YOU HAVE THAT HAVE NOTHING  TO DO WITH YOUR POCKETBOOK  ANYMORE.
IF I GAVE YOU THIS BRIEFCASE  AND IT WAS FILLED WITH MILLIONS  OF DOLLARS.
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
YOU'VE GOT IT.
FEEL PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW.
YOU FEEL PRETTY GOOD RIGHT  NOW. THEN WHAT HAPPENS? WHAT DO YOU DO?
COKE, HOOKERS.
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE  HONMY MOON PHASE OF GETTING  MONEY. THEN WHAT HAPPENS?
MORE COKE, MORE HOOKERS.
MOST PEOPLE FIND AFTER SIX  MONTHS OR A YEAR THEY SAY NOW  WHAT?
WE'RE GOING TO DIE, SO IN  BETWEEN THE TIME BETWEEN NOW AND  WE DIE WHAT DO WE FILL OUR TIME  WITH?
GET DOWN TO BUSINESS, OPEN A  NIGHTCLUB, CALL IT DOUBLE J.
AND THEN?
START A BASKETBALL LEAGUE ON  JETSKIS.
DOES THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?
YES! I HAVE TO TELL YOU GUYS, I DO  NOT SEE A BAD OUTCOME HERE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT ONLY AFTER WALKING A MILE IN  A RICH PERSON'S $4,000 SHOES DID  I TRULY KNOW THE PARALYZING ANXIETY OF SUDDEN WEALTH. SWEETHEART, PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TABLE SALT. (LAUGHTER)  YUP. THAT DID IT. AND AS THE DEVELOPER OF THE  REVOLUTIONARY APP DICK WIDGET  AND CREATOR OF THE WORLD'S MOST  POPULAR SPORT I WAS GLAD I WAS MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS LIKE  DEFURIA AND GOLDBERG TO HELP ME  CONFRONT MY DEMONS.
YOU'RE NOW A RICH GUY. YOU'RE LIKE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF  PEOPLE IN SILICON VALLEY,  SUDDENLY YOU'RE NO LONGER JASON  THE COMPUTER PROGRAMMER.
IT'S COMING OUT YOUR CHEEK.
UH-OH.
THANK YOU, DR. GOLDBERG. I'M FEELING BETTER ALREADY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: JASON JONES
