Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, VERY  EXCITING, J.K. ROWLING WILL BE  JOINING US. AN UP-AND-COMING YOUNG NOVELIST. AND I THINK INDEED. LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING VERY  QUICKLY. WE DON'T TAPE ON FRIDAYS. LAST WEEK WE ARE UNABLE TO COVER  LAST THURSDAY'S MOST IMPORTANT  TELEVISED EVENT. NO, NOT THE C.W.'S REBOOT OF  GIRL FALLS FOR CAT FACED FANTASY  MONSTER TV SERIES BEAUTY AND THE  BEAST WHICH IF I MAY SAY WITHOUT RON PERELMAN, WHAT THE [BLEEP],  WHY EVEN BOTHER? BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT... WE'RE  TALKING ABOUT THE VICE  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. THAT... WELL, THAT'S A GOOD  TITLE. ACTUALLY, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST  COULD HAVE WORKED AS WELL. IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. OF COURSE, PRE-DEBATE THINGS  LOOKED VERY BAD FOR THE  DEMOCRATS A THE FIRST  PRESIDENTIAL SHOWDOWN THE DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE, IF YOU  REMEMBER, MISSED IT. IN THIS DEBATE, THEY'RE GOING TO  BE RELYING ON CRAZY UNCLE JOE  BIDEN FOR DAMAGE CONTROL. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT LOOSE  CANNON.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE FACTS. IT CUTS EDUCATION BY $450  BILLION. $2600 LESS IN SOCIAL SECURITY. 19 MILLION PEOPLE OFF MEDICAID. 200,000 CHILDREN OFF EARLY  EDUCATION. SAVE $156 BILLION RIGHT OFF THE  BAT.
Jon: WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT  HAVE YOU DONE WITH CRAZY JOE  BIDEN? YOU'RE GOING TO REACH IN YOUR  PANTS AND OUT [BLEEP]. NOT ONLY WAS BIDEN NOT HIS  LOVABLE GAFFE-TAS TIC TOUR HE  MUST HAVE UPPEDDED HIS  PRESCRIPTION BECAUSE HE WAS FACT-CHECKING THIS DEBATE IN  REALTIME.
7.4 MILLION SENIORS ARE  PROJECTED TO LOSE THE CURRENT  MEDICARE ADVANTAGE COVERAGE THEY  HAVE. THAT'S A $3200 BENEFIT CUT. WHAT WE'RE SAYING...
MORE PEOPLE SIGNED UP  IT'S A PLAN I PUT TOGETHER  WITH A PROMINENT DEMOCRAT  SENATOR
THERE'S NOT ONE DEMOCRAT WHO  ENDORSES IT
WE PUT IT TOGETHER WITH  FORMER CLINTON BUDGET DIRECTOR
WHO DISAVOWS  YOU CAN CUT TAXES BY 20% AND  STILL...
NOT MATHEMATICALLY POSSIBLE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HE WAS JUST THROWING  THEM ALL OUT THERE. SORRY, PAUL. NUMBERWISE YOU'VE GOT YOUR HEAD  UP YOUR ASS. SORRY, PAUL, ONE PLUS ONE EQUALS  BULL [BLEEP]. I HAVE AN IDEA. WHO HAS EDDIE MUNSTER'S AIR CUT  FOR BRAINS? IT'S THIS GUY. ONE OF THE GREAT PLEASURES OF  THURSDAY NIGHT WAS WATCHING HOW  MANY DIFFERENT WAYS BIDEN  IMPLIED PAUL RYAN WAS LYING OUTACTUALLY SAYING THE WORD  "LIE."
NOT A SINGLE THING HE SAID IS  ACCURATE.
THAT'S A BIZARRE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WORLD... WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?
I WISH HE WOULD JUST BE A  LITTLE MORE CANDID.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THAT'S A  BUNCH OF MALARKY.
Jon: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,  THAT'S A BUNCH OF MALARKY. THAT'S SUCH A WEIRD COMBINATION  OF GANGSTER AND OLD-TIMEY IRISH  COLLOQUIALISM LIKE FELLOWS MEETS  THE QUIET MAN. HEY, WITH ALL DUE RESPEC, THAT'S  A BUNCH OF MALARKY. NOT FOR NOTHING. TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU. JOE BIDEN WAS ALL OVER THE COURT  SOMETIMES PLAYING THE MODERATOR,  SOMETIMES TAKING THE GAME RIGHT  TO THE VIEWERS AT HOME
DID THEY JUST ALLOW MEDICAID  TO BARGAIN FOR THE COST OF DRUGS  LIKE MEDICAID CAN. THAT WOULD SAVE $156 BILL RIGHT  OFF THE BAT
IT WOULD DENY SENIORS  CHOICES.
THEY ARE NOT DENIED... LOOK,  FOLKS, ALL YOU SENIORS OUT  THERE, HAVE YOU BEEN DENIED  CHOICES?
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, HOW DID HE  KNOW THAT I WAS A SENIOR? SECOND OF ALL, I LOVE THAT. COME ON, SENIORS, LOOK, I'M ONE  OF YOU. LOOK AT ME. I'M FALLING APART OVER HERE. WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE THE  GUY WHO ONLY HAS HAIR TODAY  BECAUSE OF ONE VERY UNHAPPY  ALPACA? I MEAN, COME ON. COME ON. OTHERWISE THEY DIDN'T TAKE HIS  HAIR FROM THE SIDE OF THE  ALPACA. I WON'T QUIBBLE. WE ALL REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED  WHEN THE GHOST OF BARACK OBAMA  DEBATED MITT ROMNEY.
WHAT WAS HE DOING TONIGHT? HE WENT IN THERE DISARM. HE WAS LIKE AN HOUR-AND-A-HALF I  THINK I CAN GET THROUGH THIS  THING. WHERE WAS OBAMA TONIGHT SNIEM  REB THEY ADMITTED TO THE... ALL  AGREED TO BELIEVE THEIR EYES AND  EARS. SO VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. FOX? YOUR MOVE
LAUGHING OFF THE PROBLEMS THE  WAY JOE BIDEN DID, PEOPLE WERE  OFFENDED BY THAT.
LAUGHING IN A HOSTILE,  AGGRESSIONIVE, SCORNFUL WAY
RADDATZ WAS PLAYING WITH THE  BIDEN TEAM
THE MODERATOR'S ACTION OR  INACTION...
HIM SMIRKING AND SMILING  RUDE, CONDESCENDING, MEAN AT  TIMES. WONDERED, YOU KNOW, IF HE HAD  SOME BURBON BEFORE HE WENT OUT  THERE
REMINDED ME OF A MUSK OX  RUNNING ACROSS THE TUNDRA WITH  THE MODERATOR UNDER FOOT. SNIEM A MUSK OX ACROSS THE  TUNDRA? SETTLE DOWN, ESKIMO ANNIE  OAKLEY. ENOUGH WITH THE MUTUAL OF OMAHA. LOOK, WE GET IT. YOU LIVE IN ALASKA. WHEN YOU LIVE IN ALASKA IN A  TOWN WITH ROADS AND A WAL-MART  AND TWO STAR BUCKS AND YOUR OWN  PLANE AND TELEVISION STATION IN YOUR HOUSE, IT'S NOT [BLEEP] OF  THE WILD OVER THERE. MY GUESS IS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A  MUSK OX RUNNING ACROSS THE  TUNDRA. YET AT FOX THE RESPONSE TO  BIDEN'S STRONG SHOWING WAS  DELEGITIMIZING EVERY ASPECT OF  THAT SHOWING IN THE MODERATOR TO BIDEN'S DEMEANOR WHICH THEY  CLAIMED WAS OFFENSIVE TO ONE  CRITICAL VOTING GROUP
THOUGHT IT WAS TOTALLY OVER  THE TOP DISRESPECTFUL. SPEAKING AS A WOMAN
I THINK IT WAS A HUGE  TURN-OFF ESPECIALLY WITH WOMEN
SAY YOU'RE IN YOUR 60s,  YOU'RE THINKING YOU'D LIKE TO  DATE AGAIN, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW  EXACTLY HOW TO TURN OFF A WOMAN, WATCH THAT DEBATE LAST NIGHT AND  FOLLOW BIDEN'S LEAD.
Jon: YEAH, FELLOWS IF YOU'RE  GOING A-COURTING AND YOU WANT TO  TURN OFF A WOMAN, ACT LIKE  BIDEN. OF COURSE IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO  KEEP WOMEN ALIVE AND HEALTHY,  YOU MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON  WHAT HE WAS SAYING, VIS-A-VIS HEALTH INSURANCE AND MEDICARE  NOT THE POLITENESS DOESN'T  COUNT. NO, POLITENESS COUNTS. POLITENESS COUNTS A GREAT DEAL  BECAUSE WHEN A LADY ARRIVES VIA  COURT ORDER AT THE DOCTOR FOR  HER MANDATORY TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND, SHE WANTS TO BE  TREATED LIKE A LADY. GOOD DAY, MADAM. MAY I GET THE DOOR FOR YOU? NEARS HOW DESPERATE FOX WAS TO  SPIN THIS DEBATE. THEY CALLED IN A DOCTOR FOR  ASSISTANCE
I DID NOT EVALUATE JOE BIDEN. BUT IF SOMEONE SAID TO ME,  LISTEN, WE WANT YOU TO DO WHAT'S  REALLY REQUIRED TO KNOW WHAT  HAPPENED THERE, YOU HAVE TO PUT DEMENTIA ON THE DIFFERENTIAL  DIAGNOSIS.
Jon: YES, YES, THAT RARE FORM  OF DEMENTIA WHERE YOU REMEMBER  TOO MUCH. BY THE WAY, THIS KNUCKLE HEAD,  KEITH ABLOW, IS ON FOX'S MEDICAL  A-TEAM. LITTLE FACT THEIR B-TEAM IS IS A  CHIMP WITH A SCREWDRIVER. TO SUM UP FOX'S POST DEBATE  COVERAGE, JOE BIDEN WAS AN  ANGRY  DEMENTED ABUSIVE DRUNK OLD CRAZY  PERSON WHO MOPPED THE FLOOR WITH OUR GUY. WE'LL BE RIGHT
