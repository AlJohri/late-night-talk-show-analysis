[  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: WE'RE BACK WITH RICHARD DAWKINS AN APPETITE FOR WONDER IS ON THE SHELVES NOW. HOW DO WE DO THAT? HOW DO WE TRY TO PUT THE BRAKES ON OUR OWN ABILITY TO ACHIEVE? OR OUR CURIOSITY?
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN EVER REALLY STOP THE MARCH OF SCIENCE IN THE SENSE OF SAYING YOU'RE FORBIDDEN TO EXERCISE YOUR NATURAL CURIOSITY. YOU CAN CERTAINLY PUT THE BRAKES ON CERTAIN APPLICATIONS. YOU CAN CERTAINLY STOP MANUFACTURING CERTAIN WEAPONS. YOU COULD YOU HAVE AN YINTERNATIONALHAVE AN AGREEMENT, DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE BUT IT'S BEEN DONE TO SOME EXTENT, INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS NOT TO MANUFACTURE WEAPONS AND DESTROY THE STOCK.
Jon: WE DO HAVE CERTAIN THINGS LIKE THAT IN PLACE AT THIS POINT.
YES.
Jon: DO YOU THINK IT'S DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT THEY NEED FROM RELIGION -- AND I THINK THERE MUST BE -- IF YOU ARE SOMEONE THAT BELIEVES THAT WE ARE INDIVIDUAL GENES THAT ARE ALL FIGHTING FOR THEIR OWN SURVIVAL. I THINK THAT'S THE THEORY OF YOUR SECOND BOOK?
WELL, I WOULDN'T PUT IT QUITE LIKE THAT.
Jon: NO BECAUSE I'M STUPID. YOU'RE LIKE A GENIUS GUY. HOW WOULD YOU PUT IT?
NATURAL SELECTION WORKING AT THE LEVEL OF GENES HAS PUT OUR BODIES HERE AND OUR BRAINS HERE, BUT OUR BRAINS ARE CAPABLE OF TAKING OFF AND DEPARTING FROM, CUTTING OURSELVES ADRIFT FROM THE DARK SIDE OF OUR DARWINIAN HERITAGE. IT CAN BE DARK. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PESSIMISTIC AND SAY WE'RE ONLY A MACHINE FOR OUR GENES. WE RISE ABOVE THAT WE'VE GOT BIG BRAINS, CULTURE, ART, MUSIC, POETRY. WE'VE GOT SCIENCE. WE'VE LEFT BEHIND THE WILD WORLD IN WHICH OUR GENES WERE NATURALLY SELECTED.
Jon: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT RELIGION GOES IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS SOME OF THOSE OR FAITH, LET'S SAY, GOES IN THE CATEGORY OF SOME OF THOSE -- YOU CLEARLY PLACE A POSITIVE VALUE ON POETRY, ON ART, ON MUSIC. COULDN'T FAITH BUT IN THAT CATEGORY?
IT BELONGS IN THAT CATEGORY IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S A PRODUCT OF HUMAN BRAINS, YES. I'M NOT SURE IT BELONGS THERE IN THE POSITIVE SENSE. I DON'T THINK FAITH IS POSITIVE. BECAUSE FAITH MEANS BELIEF WITHOUT EVIDENCE. YOU SHOULDN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING WITHOUT EVIDENCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND IT'S ALL TOO COMMON. PEOPLE WHO ARE BROUGHT UP TO SAY, I BELIEVE IT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT. IT'S JUST MY FAITH. I'M NOT ALLOWED TO CHALLENGE IT. THEN A MINORITY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE SEDUCED TO DOING TERRIBLE THINGS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THEM. YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH FAITH.
Jon: THEN MY POINT IS THERE'S AN EVOLUTIONARY DEFECT IN OUR BRAINS THAT ALLOWS US TO BE MANIPULATED. IF THAT IS THE PATHOLOGICAL  VERSION OF RELIGION, WOULDN'T THAT BE THE PATHOLOGICAL VERSION OF STATISM OR PATRIOTISM -- OR BEING A FAN OF A BASEBALL TEAM -- I'VE SEEN PEOPLE DO THINGS AT A FOOTBALL STADIUM. IT'S LIKE BLAMING TELEVISION FOR BEING CRAPPY. IT'S JUST A BOX.
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
Jon: SORRY, COULD YOU SAY THAT'S A GOOD POINT AGAIN FOR THE CAMERAS?
THAT'S A GOOD POINT. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: HASN'T IT BROUGHT -- IS FAITH -- IF IT BRINGS COMFORT TO PEOPLE AND CAUSES THEM TO BEHAVE MORALLY AND ENGAGE IN CHARITABLE CAUSES, I DON'T KNOW THOSE SEEM LIKE POSITIVE OUTCOMES. IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF RELIGION IS CENTERED AROUND THAT. LET'S TAKE THOSE ONE BY ONE.
IT BRINGS COMFORT. IT MAY BRING COMFORT. IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF DYING IT MAY WELL BRING COMFORT. IT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE.
Jon: BUT THAT'S NOT AN INSANE THING TO BE AFRAID OF.
INDEED NOT.
Jon: I'VE SEEN COWS BOY YOU KNOCK ONE OUT AND THE OTHER WALKS UP TO YOU LIKE, HEY WHAT WAS THAT? I WASN'T SAYING IT WAS INSANE AT ALL. THAT'S THE POINT.
IT GIVES YOU COMFORT BUT IT'S ILLOGICAL TO SAY BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU COMFORT THEREFORE IT'S TRUE.
Jon: WHERE DO WE GO WHEN WE DIE?
WELL, BERTRAND RUSSELL
Jon: YOU DON'T KNOW?
WE GET BURIED OR CREMATED OR GIVE OUR BODIES TO SCIENCE.
Jon: ISN'T THAT -- YOU ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO US.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO US BUT I KNOW THAT OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS WRAPPED UP IN OUR BRAINS AND OUR BRAINS ROT. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANYT. REASON BUT WISHFUL THINKING.
Jon: BUT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY?
WELL, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS.
Jon: BUT ISN'T THAT -- ISN'T THE JOB OF A SCIENTIST IN SOME WAYS TO HAVE FAITH THAT THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND YET.
YES.
Jon: AND MAYBE EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS, THE LOSS OF FAITH WOULDN'T THAT STEAL SOMETHING ESSENTIALLY HUMAN FROM SCIENTIFIC --
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE CONFUSING TWO SORTS OF FAITHS.
Jon: I AM SURE I AM. [LAUGHTER]
YOU CAN HAVE FAITH THAT, AS YOU SAID, THERE'S SOMETHING MORE FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. I WOULDN'T CALL THAT FAITH. I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. YOU COULD HAVE FAITH IN THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. YOU CAN HAVE FAITH IN YOUR WIFE OR YOUR HUSBAND, ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT THOSE ARE BASED ON EVIDENCE, WHEREAS, FAITH PER SE IS NOT. FAITH IN RELIGION IS FAITH IS FAITH IS FAITH. IT'S NOT BASED ON EVIDENCE. THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED FAITH.
Jon: RIGHT. WHEN YOU SAY THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING MORE OUT THERE JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE UNKNOWN THINGS WE'RE DISCOVERING.
PHYSICS IS INCOMPLETE.
IT DOESN'T KNOW HOW -- IT DOESN'T KNOW HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS. THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT THE -- I THINK I'M SORT OF FASCINATED BY THE IDEA THAT FAITH AND SCIENCE ARE INCOMPATIBLE AND YOU ARE RIGHT IT'S PROBABLY A SEMANTIC BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD BUT I KNOW THAT FAITH AND SCIENCE ARE BOTH CONTROLLED BY THE SAME FLAWED MECHANISM WHICH IS US.
WHEN YOU SAY YOU BELIEVE IN THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD BECAUSE IT WORKS AND IT WORKS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
Jon: YES BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE IN THE PEOPLE WHO OPERATE THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. YOU SAY IT WORKS BUT IT'S BEEN WRONG.
OH, IT'S BEEN WRONG AND THAT'S ONE OF THE GLORIES OF IT. THIT LEARNS FROM ITS MISTAKES.T. SCIENCE PROGRESSES BY REJECTING HYPOTHESES THAT HAVE FAILED.
Jon: DO YOU THINK IT'S MORE LOGICAL THAT YOU BELIEVE AFTER YOU DIE IT ALL ENDS OR THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THERE. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MAYBE NOT A PARTICULAR FAITH LIKE WE GET WHITE WINGS AND WE MOVE TOWARD THE LIGHT AND YOUR GRANDMOTHER IS THERE WITH PIE. NOT SPECIFIC FAITH BUT THE IDEA OF SOMETHING BEYOND OUR UNDERSTANDING EXISTS FOR US IS ALMOST A MORE LOGICAL CONCLUSION THAN WE ARE  CREMATED AND ROT.
SOMETHING BEYOND US. THAT, I BELIEVE -- THERE'S MANY THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE PARTICULAR THING OF SURVIVING YOUR OWN DEATH, PALPABLE WISHFUL THINKING GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS. WE'RE EVOLVED CREATURES, WE'RE APES. WE'RE AFRICAN APES. IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE YOU SURVIVE DEATH OR HUMANS DO, WHEN SDID IT START IN EVOLUTION, ALLN THAT SORT OF QUESTION.
Jon: SURE.
IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE LOGICAL SENSE.
Jon: DOES IT BRING YOU BACK TO THAT IDEA OF WHEN DID LIFE BEGIN AND DOES THAT MAKE LOGICAL SENSE?
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRAW DIVIDING LINES. YOU CAN SAY THE ORIGIN OF LIFE WAS A GRADUAL PROCESS. YOU CAN SAY THE ORIGIN OF LIFE IN THE WOMB IS A GRADUAL PROCESS FOR THAT MATTER.
Jon: I MEANT MORE THE ORIGIN OF LIFE AT THE BEGINNING OF LIFE.
FOUR BILLION YEARS AGO OR SO, A LITTLE BIT LESS MAYBE, THE FIRST SELF REPLICATING MOLECULE FCAME INTO EXISTENCE. YOU COULD THINK OF IT AS THE FIRST GENE. IT'S HARDLY LIFE BUT IT PROVIDES IT'STHE BEDROCK FOR NATURALVIDES SELECTION TO GET GOING. ONCE YOU HAVE GENES YOU HAVE THE POSSIBILITY FOR NATURAL SELECTION. AND THEN IT GRADUALLY BUILDS STRUCTURES FOR ITSELF, WHICH TO BEGIN WITH ARE RATHER SIMPLE LIKE BACTERIA. AT SOME POINT THEY START GETTING NERVOUS SYSTEMS, AND AT SOME LATER POINT THEY GET A BRAIN.
Jon: THIS IS THE PART I REMEMBER FROM SCHOOL. BACK THAT UP A LITTLE BIT. THAT FIRST PART YOU SAID WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? IS THERE EVIDENCE WHERE THAT CAME FROM?
NOT EVIDENCE BECAUSE IT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS.
Jon: IS IT JUST STATISTICS? IS IT CHANCE?
YES, ACTUALLY IT PROBABLY IS. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY IMPROBABLE EVENT. AND NOBODY KNOWS THAT. CHEMISTS ARE WORKING ON IT. BIOLOGISTS ARE WORKING ON IT. TRYING TO THINK OF IDEAS. BUT I DOUBT IT WILL EVER PROVE ANYTHING DEFINITE.
Jon: HAS ANYBODY COME CLOSE TO RECREATING THAT MOMENT?
NO. SORT OF BITS OF IT ARE BEING RECREATED. IT PROBABLY WAS A VERY IMPROBABLE EVENT. ANOTHER WAY OF PUTTING THAT IS TO ASK THE QUESTION HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT THERE'S LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS. THERE ARE ABOUT 10 TO THE 22 STARS.
Jon: THAT'S 19? [ LAUGHTER ] TO SO THE 22 IS? -- 10 TO THE 22 IS -- IF IT'S A STATISTICAL  ANOMALY CHANCES ARE THAT HAS BEEN REPLICATED.
IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THERE ARE. EVEN AS FEW AS A BILLION OTHER PLANETS MIGHT HAVE LIFE. THAT'S VERY, VERY FEW INDEED.
Jon: A BILLION PLANETS MIGHT HAVE LIFE.
IT'S A TINY NUMBER. A BILLION IS A TINY NUMBER COMPARED TO 10 TO 22. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT? [LAUGHTER] THAT'S TOTALLY A TINY NUMBER COMPARED TO THAT. [LAUGHTER]
SO WHAT I'M SAYING IF THERE ARE A BILLION PLANETS WITH LIFE THEN THEY ARE PROBABLY SO SPACED OUT, THEY ARE PROBABLY SO RARE THAT THE CHANCE THAT ANY ONE OF THEM WILL BUMP INTO ANY OTHER IS VERY LOW. THERE COULD BE MORE THAN A BILLION. IT COULD BE UNIQUE. IT COULD BE THAT LIFE IS ONLY HERE AND IT WOULD FOLLOW FROM THAT THAT THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON THIS PLANET WAS SUCH A  STUPIFYINGLY RARE EVENT WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED.
Jon: DON'T DO THAT TO ME. IF I SAY TO YOU YOU HAVE FAITH THAT OTHER LIFE IS OUT THERE YOU ARE SAYING BASED ON THE EVIDENCE? STATISTICAL EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE BILLIONS OF PLANETS. AREBUT ISN'T IT A HYPOTHESIS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT HERE.
WE DON'T KNOW. IT'S A STATISTICAL CALCULATION. A PLAUSIBILITY CALCULATION. THIS IS SO COOL TO THINK ABOUT. DO YOU WANT TO GET HIGH LATER? THINK ABOUT IT. DO YOU WANT TO GET HIGH LATER? [LAUGHTER] I DON'T HAVE ANTIPATHY TOWARDS ITHE RELIGIOUS AND I'M GETTING THE SENSE THAT YOU DON'T BUT I'VE READ SOME THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT.
I THINK DO, CERTAINLY. NOT TO EVERY RELIGIOUS INDIVIDUAL CERTAINLY NOT. SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE RELIGIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: BUT YOU ARE SAYING THAT IT'S -- AS A CONSTRUCT YOU DON'T CARE FOR IT?
NO, I THINK IT'S DESTRUCTIVE OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT.
Jon: BUT IT'S DONE SOME GOOD?
NOT MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DO YOU THINK OF NATION STATES AS MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN RELIGION.
PATRIOTISM IS DESTRUCTIVE.
Jon: SO THE ISMS. WHAT ABOUT DYSTOPIAS LIKE BRAVE NEW WORLD TYPE STUFF? ANY CONSTRUCT THAT LACKS MORALITY YOU WOULD HAVE ANTIPATHY TOWARDS? I THINK WE HAVE TO CONSTRUCT OUR OWN MORALITY. AS THE DECADES GO BY WE GET BETTER AT IT.
WE'RE A LOT MORE MORAL NOW THAN WE WERE 500 YEARS AGO OR EVEN 100 YEARS AGO.
Jon: NO I THINK THAT'S -- I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IS -- OKAY. I THINK THERE'S YOUTUBE SO NOW WE KNOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING TO EACH OTHER AND HOW CUTE THEIR CATS ARE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SEE -- HERE IS WHAT IS CRAZY. YOU TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF EVERY DAY YOUR WHOLE LIFE SO IT'S NOT THAT INTERESTING TO YOU. BUT I FIND THIS STUFF TRULY FASCINATING.
OF COURSE IT'S FASCINATING.
Jon: I HAVE LONG BELIEVED THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH RELIGION AS LONG AS IT'S NOT COERCIVE IN ANYWAY. I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT IT BRINGS A GREAT DEAL OF POSITIVE INTO THE WORLD AS LONG AS TO IT'S NOT VIEWED AS ASTHE SOLE METHODOLOGY OF THATAS POSITIVITY OR THAT MORALITY. IT CAN'T BE THAT EITHER GOD WITH HIS FINGER SAID I WILL BRING LIFE TO THIS BATHROOM MOLD OR THAT WE JUST GOT LUCKIER THAN OTHER BATHROOM MOLD. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING BETWEEN TTHOSE TWO THINGS, BETWEEN PURE STATISTICAL PROBABILITY AND DIVINE INTERVENTION.
