MY GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER CHAIR OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, HE'S CURRENTLY  POLITICAL ANALYST FOR MSNBC, PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM MICHAEL STEELE. [APPLAUSE] SIR, NICE TO SEE YOU. NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO BE HERE, MAN.
Jon: THANK GOD. THE PUPPET WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO BOOK THIS TIME. GETTING YOU HERE IS MUCH PREFERABLE.
IT'S A LOT EASIER, BUT HE SENDS HIS BEST.
Jon: I DID NOT REALIZE THAT YOU WERE HANGING OUT.
I LEFT HIM ON THE CHAIR. HE WAS HAVING A LATTE.
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS A LIBERAL. A LATTE? REALLY?
WE KIND OF BALANCE EACH OTHER.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. SO HOW ARE YOU... ARE YOU FEELING A WEIGHT OFF YOUR SHOULDERS TO NOT BE THE RNC  CHAIR DURING THIS TIME OF TUMULT WITH ALL THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES? HOW DO YOU FEEL?
I FEEL GOOD TO HAVE THE WEIGHT OFF, BUT I REALLY LIKE THE ENGAGEMENT AND WOULD LIKE TO  BE A PART OF MAKING SURE THAT WE PUT FORTH THE BEST CANDIDATE, THE BEST FOOT, THE BEST MESSAGE TO GO TOE TO TOE AND HAVE THE FOLKS OUT THERE MAKE A CHOICE  NEXT YEAR BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT BOILS DOWN. TO IT'S REALLY PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES TACT DIRECTION THE COUNTRY GOES NEXT. IS IT ONE THAT IS CENTERED AROUND A GOVERNMENT ORYENGTDED STRATEGY OR ONE THAT'S A PRIVATE  SECTOR STRATEGY OR IS THERE A HYBRID THERE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH?
Jon: A HYBRID?
YEAH. IMAGINE THAT.
Jon: SOME KIND OF... NOW, APPARENTLY THE HYBRID, THOUGH, IS UNACCEPTABLE. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE REPUBLICAN FIELD THAT WOULD ALLOW A HYBRID BECAUSE APPARENTLY ANY TYPE OF  PRIVATE-PUBLIC HYBRID, MUCH LIKE STEM CELLS, IS...
THE REALITY IS COVER FINANCE IS ABOUT CREATING THOSE HYBRIDS, THOSE MOMENTS WHERE YOU TAKE THE PHILOSOPHY AND THE REALITY AND MERGE THEM TOGETHER THROUGH A  POLICY THAT DOES WHAT YOU HOPE WILL BE THE BEST THING FOR THE PEOPLE. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF IT...
Jon: WHEN DO YOU THINK THEY'LL THEN GOVERN IN REALITY.
THAT'S THE QUESTION. WE'RE STILL WAITING.
Jon: OH, OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH.
WE'RE STILL WAITING. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.
Jon: THE REPUBLICANS SEEM ANXIOUS TO JUST KEEP GETTING MORE PEOPLE IN THERE. YOU KNOW, BOSTON HAD THIS BIG WEEKEND. RICK PERRY, EVERYONE WAS ALL EXCITED TO HAVE HIM THERE THERE. THEY'RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT PAUL RYAN AND CHRIS CHRISTIE.
CAN WE STOP THE NOISE ON THAT ALREADY? THE REALITY IS THIS FIELD IS SET. YOU HAVE THE TOP TIER. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD THAT TERM IN THE PAST WEEK. BUT YOU HAVE THE THREE FOLKS THAT WILL BE LEADING THE CHARGE. YOU HAVE HERMAN CAIN AND NEWT GINGRICH, WHO I THINK DID HIMSELF REALLY WELL IN THE LAST  DEBATE IN TERMS OF LAYING OUT SOME POLICY.
Jon: SO NEWT GINGRICH IS STILL RUNING?
HE'S STILL RUNNING, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. HE'S STILL RUNNING. BUT I THINK THIS CONVERSATION BY A LOT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT TYPE, PARTICULARLY IN WASHINGTON...
Jon: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS.
KARL ROVE OR THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL," THEY NEED TO CUT THAT NOISE OUT...
Jon: THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED.
TOO BAD. GET OVER IT. THE REALITY IS THESE ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE GOING TO BE RUNNING. ALL THOSE OTHER INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GOING TO GET INTO THIS RACE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THEY HAVE  TO GET ON THE BALL YACHT IN 50 STATES, AND THAT'S A PROCESS THAT TAKES TIME. THEY HAVE TO RAISE MONEY. THEY HAVE TO PUT THE ORGANIZATION IN PLACE, AND IF THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT BY NOW, PARTICULARLY WITH PERRY, BACHMANN AND ROMNEY, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. VAUGHN JON FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO, AND I'M NOT AN ELECTION LAW SPECIALIST OR LITIGATOR, BUT APPARENTLY IF YOU HAVE A ONE  NATION BUS AND YOU'RE SARAH PALIN, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO JUST DRIVE. EVEN ON INAUGURATION DAY, JUST DRIVE RIGHT IN AND SAY, I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.
EXACTLY.
Jon: FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND.
YEAH, YEAH.
YOU MENTIONED KARL ROVE. THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING THING. FOR MANY YEARS KARL ROVE WAS A SACRED HOLY MAN IN THE REPUBLICAN...
REALLY?
DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION...
NOT MY HOLY MAN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
Jon: I THOUGHT HE WAS CONSIDERED THE... THEY REFERRED TO HIM AS THE ARCHITECT OF THE...
IS THAT REALLY IT?
YEAH, BUT ARE... WHY DO YOU THINK HE IS NOT FINDING THESE CANDIDATES ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE  THEY SEEM TO BE UTILIZING STRATEGIES AND POLICIES THAT HE WOULD APPROVE OF?
YOU WOULD THINK. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE RICK PERRY, WHO HAS REALLY COME OUT OF THE GATES STRONG. YOU CAN'T CONTROL HIM. HE HAS HIS OWN SET OF IDEAS, HIS OWN WAY OF DOING HIS THING. YOU CANNOT PUT HIM IN THE BOX AND SAY, OKAY RUSSIA YOU GOING TO DO IT THIS WAY. AND WE, THE ESTABLISHMENT, WHOEVER THEY HAPPEN TO BE, APPROVE. THE SAME WITH THE SARAH PALIN. YOU NOTICE, YOU CAN ALWAYS...
Jon: I LIKE HOW YOU REFER TO IT AS "THE SARAH PALIN."  SHE'S JUST A NOUN AT THIS POINT.
SHE IS ALSO A GOOD FRIEND. SHE'S A GOOD LADY, BUT SHE'S NOT... I DON'T THINK SHE'S RUNNING.
Jon: SO YOU THINK THE ISSUE THERE IS KARL ROVE WOULD LIKE TO  FEEL... IS THAT AN EGO SITUATION OR IS THAT MONEY? AS THE RNC CHAIR, ROVE HAS THIS CROSSROADS GPS. WHERE DOES HE GET HIS MONEY FROM?
FROM RNC DONORS.
Jon: IS THAT THE CONFLICT NOW?
WELL, IT'S NOT... WELL, IT WAS A CONFLICT WHEN I WAS CHAIRMAN AND CERTAINLY BUT IT  ISN'T NOW BECAUSE EVERYONE IS KIND OF BACK TO STATUS QUO, THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE I CAME IN.
YOU GOT MUSCLED.
I GOT MUSCLED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT, BUT I DID MY THING. I WON THE 63 HOUSE SEATS THEY NEEDED. I PICKED UP 600 STATE LEGISLATIVE RACES AND WE RAISED A LOT OF MONEY AND WON. SO DON'T SCREW IT UP, YOU KNOW.
Jon: IS THIS NOW A CHANGING OF THE REPUBLICAN GUARD IF RICK PERRY BECOMES THE NOMINEE?
A VERY DIFFERENT GROUP OF PEOPLE COMING IN.
Jon: DOES KARL ROVE MAKE HIMSELF AVAILABLE TO MR. PERRY?
THAT WILL HAPPEN. NO. [LAUGHTER] THE REALITY...
Jon: ANSWER THIS QUESTION AS YOU WOULD HAVE WHEN YOU WERE STILL RNC CHAIR. I JUST WANT TO HEAR THE DIFFERENCE. JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT, THE DIFFERENCE. [APPLAUSE]
AS RNC CHAIRMAN I WOULD HAVE SAID, YEAH, IN SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFETIME.
Jon: OKAY.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER. EVERYONE KNOWS AND THE HISTORY IS WELCOME TOED OF THE STRESS AND STRAIN BETWEEN THE BUSH-ROVE  CAMP AND THE PERRY CAMP, EVEN THOUGH BUSH ENCOURAGED THEN- DEMOCRAT PERRY TO SWITCH PARTIES. BUT IT WAS MATTER OF ONCE HE DID, THAT ONCE HE GOT INTO CAMP, HE'S LIKE, I GOT MY OWN THING, I'M DOING MY OWN THING. THAT'S TRUE WITH A LOT OF THESE FOLKS. AND I THINK THE REALITY IS THE PARTY IS CHANGING AND IT'S BEEN CHANGING GOING BACK NOT TO THE  LAST TWO YEARS OR SO, BACK TO 2005, 2004 IT'S BEEN CHANGING.
Jon: BACK TO THE 1850s.
BACK TO THE 1850s.
Jon: MOVES IN A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
VERY DIFFERENT PARTY. THEN IT WAS MORE ABOUT INDIVIDUALS. TODAY IT'S MORE ABOUT INSTITUTIONS AND BIG-GOVERNMENT REPUBLICANISM IS WHY YOU SAW THE  FORMATION OF A TEA PARTY STRATEGY EMERGE AROUND THE COUNTRY. I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE SAME THING ON THE LEFT. WITH THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT TAKING HOLD AS IT BEGAN TO DO IN WISCONSIN EARLIER THIS YEAR. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THIS...
Jon: A GRASSROOTS BATTLE.
A GRASSROOTS BATTLEMENT THEY NEED IT. THEY NEED IT ON THE LEFT. THEY NEED TO HAVE THAT ANCHOR PHILOSOPHICALLY OF WHAT DO WE REALLY PHILOSOPHICALLY BELIEVE IN. AND A LOT OF THAT STARTS WITH THOSE EXTREME POSITIONS THAT HELP YOU MOVE TO THAT SPOT WHERE  THE FOLKS OUT HERE ULTIMATELY BENEFIT.
I THINK YOU WOULD MAKE A TERRIFIC DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIRMAN. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: NICELY DONE. YOU CAN PLAY FOR ANYBODY. MICHAEL STEELE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
