Jon: SHE'S VERY TALENTED. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW  ANN HATHAWAY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WOW! Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  BEING HERE
THANK YOU. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   THANK YOU FOR BEING BACK ON THE  AIR.
Jon: WE'RE DELIGHTED. I'M DELIGHTED TO BE BACK. WE MISSED IT. I JUST SPENT THE WHOLE TIME IN  MY UNDERWEAR YELLING AT THE TV.
YOU TOO? Jon: IT'S GOOD TO PUT ON A  SUIT AND YELL AT PEOPLE WHILE  THEY'RE WATCHING TV. I DON'T SEE A LOT OF MOVIES  BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW I'M AFRAID  OF THE DARK. BUT I WENT TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN  PARTICULAR, LES MISERABLES  BECAUSE LIKE ALL AMERICANS I LIVE 19th CENTURY FRENCH  HISTORY. I AM NOT A MOVIE CRITIC. YOU ARE REDONKULOUS IN THIS  MOVIE  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: NORMALLY I ONLY CRY WHEN  WATCHING THE METS. YOUR PERFORMANCE IS SO SPECIAL  AND NUANCED BUT IT LOOKED  EXHAUSTING TO... WHEN YOU WERE DONE WITH IT, DID THEY DO THAT? WAS THAT ALL DAY WHEN YOU'RE  SEEING THAT BIG NUMBER
YEAH, YEAH. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU  JUST SAID
Jon: YEAH, I'M NICE. I'M GOING TO START FIDGETING  NOW. YEAH, THAT WAS TAKE 4. AND OUR DIRECTOR TOM HOOPER CAME  UP TO ME AFTERWARDS AND SAID WE  CAN MOVE ON IF YOU WANT. FOR MANY REASONS THAT I SHOULD  REALLY TALK TO A THERAPIST ABOUT   ABOUT, I SAID NO, NO, NO, WE'VE GOT TO KEEP GOING. I CAN GO DEEPER AND DO BETTER. I KNOW IT. WE FILMED FOR LIKE ANOTHER EIGHT  HOURS.
Jon: WHAT?  BY THE END OF IT  WERE YOU JUST MAKING UP SONG  PARODIES
THE SONG BEGINS MY CHARACTER  HAS JUST HAD HER FIRST  EXPERIENCE AS A PROSTITUTE. TOM HOOPER JUST, THE LIGHT  HEARTED GUY HE IS DECIDED THAT  EXPERIENCE SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN A COFFIN. AT THE END OF THE DAY HE'S LIKE  HOW WAS THE COFFIN? AND I WAS LIKE YEAH.
Jon: WHY WOULDN'T I? THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE. THE LAST SEVEN HOURS, NO WAY. WE DIDN'T HAVE TO CUT
Jon: YOU SANG THE WHOLE SONG  IN A COFFIN
WE DID ONE TAKE LIKE THAT. THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY EVEN I  WAS LIKE THIS IS STUPID.
Jon: WILL THAT BE ON THE DVD? OH, GOD, I HOPE NOT  Jon: NORMALLY AT THE END OF  THESE MOVIES, LES MISERABLES  IT'S A TRAGEDY.
ARE YOU TRYING TO AVOID  SOMETHING?
Jon: LES MIS... THERE'S OUT THE OUTTAKE REEL  WHERE THEY'RE LIKE [BLEEP], YOU  KNOW, WHERE THEY'RE LIKE. IN THIS MOVIE EVERYBODY DIES. THERE'S LIKE TWO SURVIVORS AND  GHOSTS ON A RAM PART.
ONE THING THAT HAPPENS THERE  WEREN'T A LOT OF MOMENTS ON THIS  BUT AT THE END OF THE MOVIE, AT THE LAST SCENE JEAN VAL JEAN  DIES, SPOILER.
Jon: READ THE BOOK. AND HUGH IS DOING LIKE THE  BEST ACTING THAT I THINK I'VE  SEEN ANYONE DO. HE'S ASTONISHING IN IT. I COME BACK AND I'M A GHOST. I AM SINGING TO HIM. THEN HE DIES. I HAD TO KIND OF CRAWL UNDER  CAMERA IN ORDER TO COME UP AGAIN  AND THEN TAKE HIS HAND AND LEAD HIM OFF.
Jon: TO HEAVEN  TO HEAVEN. ANOTHER SPOILER ALERT.
Jon: THEY GO TO HEAVEN  SO I'M WORRIED THAT I'M BEING  TOO DISTRACTING WHEN I GO UNDER THE CAMERA. IN THIS MOMENT OF TRUE GENIUS I  DECIDE, OH, WELL, WHAT IF I DIVE  UNDER AND REALLY FAST AND DON'T DO A LOT OF FEATHER STEPS SO I  DIVE UNDER THE CAMERA, MY FOOT  GOT CAUGHT ON MY DRESS. POOR HUGH IS THERE DEAD. AS THOUGH HE WAS A CORPSE. AND I TRIED TO SING. IT GOES "TAKE MY HAND" AND I'M  LAUGHING. AND THE MAN IS SAYING WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS GOING ON? THEN FINALLY, THANK GOD, HUGH  BROKE. TOM, THE LIGHT-HEARTED TOM  HOOPER, WASN'T HAPPY
Jon: AFTER YOU FALL, IS HE  WATCHING IT IS HE LIKE, "ANN  MIGHT BE DEAD FOR REAL." DOES HE STOP?
NO, HE'S ACTUALLY A WONDERFUL  GUY. WE HAD A GREAT TIME WORKING ON  THIS. HE LIKES TO TORTURE ACTORS
Jon: WHATEVER HE DID TO YOU  GUYS, THEY SHOULD DO IT AGAIN  BECAUSE YOU GUYS DID A BEAUTIFUL PERFORMANCE THROUGH AND THROUGH
THANK YOU  Jon: IT'S THAT AND TANGLED  ARE MY TWO FAVORITES. I'M TELLING YOU, MAN, REALLY  GOOD. SHE'S JUST RIDICULOUS IN IT. IF YOU'RE A FAN OF YOU KNOW WHO  MAY BE VISITING YOU AND HUGH  JACKSON, YOU MAY GET A VISIT FROM OSCAR. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   LES MISERABLES.
THANK YOU.
