FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BOY DO WE HAVE ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. WE'RE HERE LIVE FROM THE GREAT  CITY OF TAMPA. NO THAT WAS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOOD MEMORIES. JUST GOOD MEMORIES. WE HAVE A GREAT ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. OUR GUEST FAWZIA KOOFI, AN  INCREDIBLE WOMAN, RUNNING TO BE  PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN. YOU HEARD ME RIGHT, WOMAN,  AFGHANISTAN, PRESIDENCY. VERY EXCITED TO BE SPEAKING TO  HEMPLE INCREDIBLE STORY. WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO ONE OF  OUR FAVORITE NIGHTS OF YEAR. HOT OFF THE PRESSES ONE DAY OLD  EXPANDED COVERAGE OF LAST  NIGHT'S STATE OF THE UNION  ADDRESS. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HITS THE  FLOOR FOR SOME REASON WITH  REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN ERIC CANTOR IN TOW IN NO WAY MAKING  THIS SEEM LIKE A CHARISMATIC  STAR PERFORMER WALKING THE RED CARPET WITH HIS AGENT. BABY DOLL WE GOTTA MOVE. MARIO LOPEZ HAS A SATELLITE  WINDOW WE HAVE TO HIM. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M SORE I'M -- SORRY. JUST SWEAT AGE BIT. I'M JUST GOING TO, JUST GOING  TO -- GET SOMETHING TO DRINK  HERE. [LAUGHTER] JUST SO THIRSTY I CAN'T --  SORRY. SHOULD HAVE DRANK SOMETHING  BEFORE THE SHOW. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T THINK  AFTER THIS. ANYWAY IT'S THE STATE OF UNION  SO AS THE LATE GREAT ED KOCH  WOULD SAY, HOW WE DOING?
A FAMILY WITH CHILDREN MAKING  THE MINIMUM WAGE STILLS LIVES  BELOW THE POVERTY. THERE'S COMMUNITIES WHERE NO  MATTER HOW HARD YOU WORK IT'S  VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET  AHEAD.
Jon: I MEAN WHO IS RUNNING  THIS (bleep), RIGHT, PEOPLE? COME ON. HE SHOULD GET ON THIS STUFF --  OH, WAIT A MINUTE. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR HOW LONG? BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PRESIDENT  CONTINUED PAINTEDDING HIS PICK  TURF AN AMERICA THAT SOUNDED MORE LIKE AN APPLEBEE'S LADEN  DISTOAPIC HEALTH ESCAPE.
TODAY FEWER THAN THREE IN TEN  FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE ENROLLED A  HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND BRIDGES  ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
Jon: WAIT, WAIT AS THIRSTY  AS I AM I DON'T KNOW WHY I WOULD  BE EATING SALT YEENS. THAT IS JUST GOING TO MAKE THE  PROBLEM WORSE. YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT  BRIDGE?
70,000 STRUCTURAL DEFICIENT  BRIDGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
Jon: SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE LED  WITH THAT ONE? 70,000 STRUCTURALLY DEFICIENT. SHOULDN'T YOU JUST OPENED WITH  THAT OR BROKE INTO WHATEVER  PROGRAMMING WAS PLAYING WITH AN URGENT MESSAGE THE NIGHT YOU  FOUND THAT OUT. HEY, EVERYBODY, THIS IS  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA THE  BRIDGES ARE DEATH TRAPS. FOR THE NEXT THREE HOURS I'M  GOING TO STAND HERE AND NAME  BRIDGES. THE AA AARONSON BRIDGE, DON'T  TAKE THE. CLOCK WIPE. ALL THE BRIDGES IN MADISON  COUNTY. CLOCK WIPE. THE TAPPAN ZEE. [ LAUGHTER ] SERIOUSLY THAT THING IS -- WHOO! GOD I'M SO SORRY, SO THIRSTY I'M  JUST GOING TO -- I'M GOING TO --  OH, NO. I'M SO THIRSTY AND I ATE  SALTINES AND NOW I'M WORKING  OUT. IT'S NEVER GOING TO HELP MY  THIRST, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO. MR. PRESIDENT, YOU LAID OUT THE  LITANY OF WOE THAT FACES THIS  NATION. I BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO -- THIS  IS GOING TO MAKE A HELL OF A --  SORRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SORRY. NOT GOOD. [LAUGHTER] THREE PEOPLE LIKED THAT, 50  PEOPLE GOT NAUSEOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] LISTEN, BARACK OBAMA, YOU LAID  OUT THE TERRIBLE THINGS IN THIS  COUNTRY. I BELIEVE IT'S SPIRIT RAISING  TIME AND THE POWER OF WHAT WE  CAN ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH LAWS,  INITIATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE  ACTS.
NO LAWS, NO INITIATIVES, NO  ADMINISTRATIVE ACTS WILL  PERFECTLY SOLVE ALL THE CHALLENGES I'VE OUTLINED  TONIGHT. BUT WE WERE NEVER SENT HERE TO  BE PERFECT.
Jon: YOU ARE (bleep)  KILLING ME. YOU ARE KILLING ME! NO ONE IS EXPECTING PERFECTION  JUST, YOU KNOW, EXPECTING THAT  THROUGH COORDINATING EFFORT WE CAN LOWER THE UNSAFE BRIDGE  COUNT IN THIS COUNTRY. [ LAUGHTER ] TO FOUR FIGURE TERRITORY. 9,000, 8,000. I GET WE'RE NOT PERFECT. HOW DO WE START?
EVERY DAY WE SHOULD ASK  OURSELVES THREE QUESTIONS AS A  NATION.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, LET ME TRY. STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE  BEFORE. WHICH OF THE 70,000 BRIDGES ARE  NEAR MY HOUSE? [LAUGHTER] NUMBER TWO, ARE THE TUNNELS  OKAY? [LAUGHTER] AND NUMBER THREE, HOW DID HE  MEET THEIR MOTHER BECAUSE IF  IT'S SOMETHING LIKE IN A BAR OR ON A J-DATE I'M GOING BE ANO, ID  BECAUSE I PUT EIGHT YEARS INTO  THIS (bleep). IF THEY COME OUT WITH I WOKE UP  AND THERE SHE WAS, NO. SO -- MY LIPS ARE JUST SO --  IT'S SO HOT IN HERE. I'M SWEATING AND EATING  SALTINES. YOU WOULD THINK AS A VETERAN OF  TELEVISION PRODUCTION I WOULD  KNOW, BUT I DON'T. GOT NEWS FOR BARACK OBAMA IS  EVEN WITH THE SORRY STATE OF  AFFAIRS IN THIS COUNTRY -- OH, WHAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A SHOW  HOSTED BY AN AGING FRENCH WHORE  BEFORE? PRUDE, PRISSES, ALL OF YOU. DON'T JUDGE ME. I JUDGE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN DOES THIS THING GO OFF THE  RAILS? ANYONE KNOW? [LAUGHTER] THE GOOD NEWS FOR BARACK OBAMA  IS EVEN WITH THE SORRY STATE  AFTER FAIRS IN THIS COUNTRY HE'S NOT GOING TO DO THE HEAVY  LIFTING BY HIMSELF. HE HAS A SUPPORT OF HIS  DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES AND  WHITMAN SAMPLERS OF AMERICAN  HEROS. HEROS, OH, GOD YEAH, HEROS. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP ME  BECAUSE I'M STILL SO THIRSTY. MY FAVORITE HERO WAS DESOLENE  VICTOR.
WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE EXAM OF  A NORTH MIAMI WOMAN NAMED  DESOLENE VICTOR. SHE WAS TOLD THE WAIT TO VOTE  MIGHT BE SIX HOURS. SHE'S 102 YEARS OLD.
Jon: THAT'S THE MOST  ADORABLE WOMAN I'VE SEEN ON THE  PLANET. SCREW THE CAT TOKEN THAT WOMAN  SHOULD BE THE THE NEW MONOPOLY  PIECE. THAT'S WHAT I SAY. ANYWAY -- [LAUGHTER] LIQUID. MMMMM, YES THE STATE OF THE  UNION ADDRESS IS A POWERFUL  BULLY PULPIT WHERE THE PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO  SHAPE HIS MESSAGE.
WE'VE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO  HAVE A FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE OUR  COUNTER TERRORISM EFFORTS. THROUGHOUT, WE HAVE KEPT  CONGRESS FULLY INFORMED --
Jon: NO, CONGRESS HAS MADE  FORMAL REQUESTS FOR  ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTS ON DRONE STRIKES AT LEAST 18 TIMES  SINCE 2011. THE ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING  THEY KEPT CONGRESS FULLY  INFORMED. THAT'S LIKE FACEBOOK TELLING ME  HOW MUCH THEY CARE ABOUT MY  PRIVACY. REALLY, FACEBOOK, HOW COME MY  MOM WOUND UP SEEING THIS? [LAUGHTER] YEAH. WHAT IT'S FOR AT THAT TOBACCO. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST USED IT FOR MARIJUANA. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DYSFUNCTIONAL HAS OUR  GOVERNMENT BECOME? A FACE OF ALL THE LARGE SERIOUS  PROBLEMS LISTED BY THE PRESIDENT  OUR ABILITY TO ACT REMAINS SMALL  BORE.
LET'S AGREE RIGHT HERE RIGHT  NOW TO KEEP THE PEOPLE'S  GOVERNMENT OPEN AND PAY OUR BILLS ON TIME.
Jon: THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA. YOU JUST SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY  THAT TO ADULTS. YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY  THAT TO ANYONE NOT COMING OUT OF  PRISON. GUYS IF WE WON'T GET GET OUR  (bleep) TOGETHER, REPOE MAN IS  GOING TO TAKE FLORIDA. LET'S DO THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
