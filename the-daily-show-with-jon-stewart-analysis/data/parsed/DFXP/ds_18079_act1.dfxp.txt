THE AWS TEARITY MEASURES FROM  THE SEQUESTER ARE TAKING THE  TOLL ONED THE NEEDY IN THIS  COUNTRY. THE GUN CONTROL IS LOSING  MOMENTUM AND WALKING DEAD IS OFF  THE AIR UNTIL OCTOBER AND THERE WAS A FOURTH THING I KEEP  FORGETTING.
NORTH KOREA IS ONE AGAIN  RATCHETING UP TENSIONS WITH THE  UNITED STATES.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH THAT WAS IT  THREE OTHER BAD THINGS AND THEN  THAT NORTH KOREA THING. FOR SOME REASON NOBODY CAN  FIGURE OUT NORTH KOREA HAS  DECIDED TO RATCHET UP TENSIONS OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY [SPEAKING KOREAN] [LAUGHTER] AND NOW TO PHIL WITH SPORTS! PHIL! [LAUGHTER] TAKE IT AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT READING  THE NEWSCAST. VERY ANGRY. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE  COPY OF NANCY GRACE'S SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] SECOND OF ALL, WHAT THE HELL  NORTH KOREA. WHEN DID ALL THIS START. WHAT IS KIM JONG-IL'S BOY UP  HERE?
KIM JONG-UN WARNED HIS FORCES  ARE READY TO AS HE PUT IT  "SETTLE ACCOUNTS WITH THE UNITED STATES."
LOOK PAST THE PICTURE OF KIM  JONG-UN. THERE'S A CHART WITH MISSILE  TRAILS AIMING AT HAWAII,  CALIFORNIA, D.C. AND FOR SOME REASON AUSTIN, TEXAS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU ARE GOING TO BLOW  UP AUSTIN, TEXAS. WHAT ARE YOU JUST TRYING TO GET  THE REST OF TEXAS. IT ON YOUR SIDE? [LAUGHTER] OR -- ARE YOU TRYING TO GET THE  REST OF TEXAS ON YOUR SIDE? OR DID THEY REJECT YOUR INDI  FILM LITTLE MISS UNSHINE. IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE MAD ABOUT? ALL RIGHT. NICE LEGS. OLD KIM IS TRYING TO SCARE US A  LITTLE BIT. THE BOMBING AUSTIN THING  UNDERCUTS BUT WHAT SNELS.
THIS SHOWING NORTH KOREAN  MILITARY LEADERS LOOKING AT A  COMPUTER THAT LOOKS PRETTY  ANTIQUATED.
Jon: LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT  THERE. IT DOESN'T LOOK ANTIQUATED IT  LOOKS LIKE A HARPSICORD WITH A  PANIC BUTTON. PLANNING TO START A NUCLEAR WAR  OR PLAY NIGHTS IN WHAT SATIN,  WOW, AM I OLD. I THOUGHT THAT WOULD LAND THERE  BUT PERHAPS THE AUDIENCE WAS  THINKING WELL THAT WAS ACTUALLY NOT ON A HARDSICHORD. THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T LAUGH NOT  THE FACT THAT YOU ARE (bleep)  OLD MAN. PROVOKE US, KIM.
NORTH KOREA RELEASED A  PICTURE SHOWS AMPHIBIOUS  PICTURES ENGAGED IN A MILITARY  EXERCISE. EXPERTS FOUND AT LEAST SIX OF  HOVERCRAFT WERE PHOTOSHOPPED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, SIX  HOVERCRAFTS ARRRGH. SECOND OF ALL THAT IS THE WORST  PHOTOSHOP JOB I'VE DOCTOR I  DON'T THINK IT'S PHOTOSHOPPED. IT LOOKS LIKE MS PAINT. WINDOWS 95 SLAM! WOO! HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT  HAPPENED? WHAT? OH, SON OF A BITCH! I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT THE BLUE  SCREEN OF DEATH. IT'S A JOKE. WINDOWS 59 IS THE REVOLUTIONARY  OPERATING SYSTEM THAT FORMED THE  FOUNDATION FOR MUCH OF THE TECHNOLOGY WE ENJOY TODAY. JEEZ, TOUCHY. LOOK, KIM -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- I KNOW YOU ARE ITCHING TO  FIGHT US, KIM. YOU KNOW, BUT I MEAN FOR A YOUNG  GUY YOUR WAR MOTHERING IS RETRO. WITH THE GOOSE STEPPING AND THE  HILL CONQUERING AND -- REALLY  CARDBOARD CUT OUT TARGETS AND THERE'S A COMMANDER ON THE  BRIDGE? WHAT IS THAT, BINOCULARS? MAGNIFIED VISION IN BOTH EYES? [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS,  BUT WE'VE MOVED ON FROM THAT  PAST THING. WAR IS A LITTLE MORE MODERN NOW.
TWO MASSIVE B-2'S SOARED 6500  MILES FROM MISSOURI TO DROP  DUMMY WEAPONS ON A BOMBING RANGE WEST OF SOUTH KOREA AND LESS  THAN 50 MILES FROM THE NORTH  KOREAN BORDER AND THEN FLEW BACK TO THE U.S.
Jon: FOR LUNCH MOTHER  (bleep). FOR LUNCH! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE MIDDAY MEAL [ONE PERSON IN  CROWD CHANTS U.S.A.] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: GETTING A LITTLE  CARRIED AWAY. YOU UNDERSTAND. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, WE'RE FLATTERED, BUT WE'RE  NOT INTERESTED. WE'LL CALL YOU.
THIS WARNING THE NORTH VOWED  TO RESTART A NUCLEAR REACTOR.
Jon: WE'RE LISTENING.
NORTH KOREA SAYS IN PART IT'S  FOR ELECTRICITY.
Jon: PHEW. ALL RIGHT. LIKE I SAID WE'LL CALL YOU.
THE PROBLEM IS THE PLANT HAS  NEVER BEEN ATTACHED TO THE POWER  GRID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HEY, I SEE A PROBLEM  RIGHT HERE YOU GOTTA RUN SOME  CONDUITS TO THE NUCLEAR REACTOR THERE YOU WON'T GET ANY JUICE TO  THE STREET. LET ME RUN TO THE TRUCK AND GRAB  CONDUIT. IT WILL TAKE LIKE A MINUTE. YOU GOTTA RUN SOME CONDUIT. WHAT ELSE IS THIS THING GOOD  FOR?
IT COULD MAKE ENOUGH  PLUTONIUM IN A YEAR FOR A  NUCLEAR BOMB.
Jon: I HEAR YOU. LET ME RUN OUT TO MY TRUCK. WOW. SO YOU GOT NUCLEAR BOMBS, ALL  RIGHT. YOU ARE HELL BENT ON THIS WAR,  AREN'T YOU? I'M GOING TO LET YOU IN ON A  SECRET. I DON'T THINK AMERICA IS GOING  TO BE THE COMMITTED ADVERSARIAL  RELATIONSHIP YOU ARE LOOKING  FOR. SEE WE JUST OUT OF TWO VERY  SERIOUS WARS. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY HIGH MAINTENANCE, STILL  HAVEN'T GOTTEN ALL (bleep)  BACK FROM THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S US. IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF  CONFLICT RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING BE  A REBOUND WAR, AND I DON'T THINK YOU WANT THAT. JUST STRAIGHT UP DESTRUCTION,  YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? JUST TO REMIND US THE EQUIPMENT  STILL WORKS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, HEY, ARE  YOU GUYS OKAY AFTERWARDS OR CAN  WE TRAIN YOUR LOCAL POLICE FORCE DURING A COMPLEX POLITICAL  TRANSGLITION IT'S JUST GOING TO  BE WHAM BAM BAM BAM, WHAM. KABOOM, WHAM BAM. YOU WANT TO THINK LONG AND HARD  ABOUT WHY YOU WOULD REALLY WANT  TO DO THIS. ANALYSTS SAY KIM JONG-UN IS  TRYING TO SOLIDIFY HIS  LEADERSHIP AT HOME BY  MANUFACTURING A CRISIS TO LOOK LIKE A HERO TO HIS PEOPLE.
Jon: WAIT, THIS IS ABOUT  DOMESTIC POLITICS? THIS IS A MESSAGE YOU ARE  SENDING YOUR PEOPLE? WHY DO YOU NEED TO GET US JUMPY  OVER IT? NO ONE IN YOUR CURRENT GETS TV  FROM OUTSIDE YOUR COUNTRY. TELL THEM YOU ARE MENACING US. TELL THEM UCONN QUERD US. WE DON'T CARE. TELL THEM -- TELL THEM YOU  ALREADY CONQUERED US, WE DON'T  CARE.
