(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE WAS A TWO TERM GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF MICHIGAN. HER NEW BOOK WHICH SHE COWROTE WITH HER HUSBAND IS CALLED A GOVERNOR'S STORY, THE FIGHT FOR JOBS IN AMERICA'S ECONOMIC FUTURE. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JENNIFER GRANHOLM. (APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU.
I'M GREAT.
Jon: GOVERNOR'S STORY, FIGHT FOR JOBS AND AMERICA'S ECONOMIC FUTURE. YESTERDAY WE HAD ON ANOTHER MIDWESTERN GOVERNOR FACED WITH A LOT OF SIMILAR THINGS  THAT YOU FACED IN MICHIGAN ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. HOW MUCH DO GOVERNORS COME TOGETHER ON POLICY? HOW MUCH OF IT-- WHEN YOU ARE A GOVERNOR HOW MUCH IS IDEAOLOGICAL, HOW MUCH IS PRAGMATIC.
A TON OF IT IS PRAK MATIC BUT WE DO COMPETE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, FOR JOBS. WE'RE ALWAYS BOASTING OH, I GOT THIS JOB FROM, YOU KNOW, ILLINOIS OR INDIANA OR TEXAS, EVERY GOVERNOR IS IN THE GAME OF COMPETING FOR JOBS. AND THAT'S NOT A VERY GOOD NATIONAL STRATEGY.
Jon: SO YOU ARE NOT JUST COMPETING GLOBALLY.
NO.
Jon: YOU'RE ACTUALLY COMPETING WITH RIGHT-TO-WORK STATES.
WELL, AND EVERY GOVERNOR HAS AN INTERVENTIONIST ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  STRATEGY, YOU KNOW, RICK PERRY WHO SAYS, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GET GOVERNMENT OUT  OF YOUR BUSINESS, BUT EVERY DAY HIS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TEAM HAS BIG ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT FUND AND THEY'RE LURING BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRATEGIC TO TEXAS. AN THEY'RE CLOSING DEALS WITH SOME MONEY FROM THIS FUND THAT'S PAID FOR BY OIL  & GAS ROYALTIES. EVERY STATE HAS GOT SOME VERSION OF THAT. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE S THE REASON WHY WE WROTE THIS BOOK IS THAT IS A REALLY BAD NATIONAL STRATEGY. BECAUSE YOU ARE JUST MOVING BUSINESSES FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER, ALL THROUGH TAX INCENTIVES. YOU'RE REALLY-- RATHER THAN COMPETING AND INVITING THE GLOBE TO INVEST.
Jon: YOU'RE SUGGESTING A DARWINNIAN STRATEGY EVERY MAN FOR THEMSELVES, MAY THE  BEST MAN WIN IS NOT A GOOD NATIONAL STRATEGY. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT I BUY THAT. A, I LOVE THE ROUND-ROBIN ASPECT OF IT. I THINK THE BCS COULD LEARN A THING OR TWO. (LAUGHTER) HIS SUGGESTION, OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, THE BIG IDEA RIGHT NOW THAT'S FLOATING IS WE MUST ONLY CUT-- WE MUST DO  WHATEVER WE CAN TO MAKE CORPORATIONS COMFORTABLE AND WANT TO BE WITH US, LOVE US. WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU, THE BOOK IS JUST HEARTBREAKING, STORY AFTER HEARTBREAKING STORY.
BUT IT HAS A HOPEFUL ENDING.
Jon: YES, DON'T SPOIL IT FOR PEOPLE.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
JUST SAYING.
Jon: BRUCE WILLIST IS DEAD THE WHOLE TIME. BUT IT, IS, YOU ARE FIELDING CALLS FROM BUSINESSES CONSTANTLY SAYING TO YOUING  I'M SORRY, WE'RE MOVING TO TEXAS, IN THE CASE OF COMERICA MOVED THEIR  HEADQUARTERS TO TEXAS AND OTHERS. AND IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR YOU HAVE NO RECOURSE TO THAT.
WELL, THAT'S-- EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS COUNTRY HAPPENS IN MICHIGAN FIRST. BECAUSE WE NEVER CAME OUT OF THE 2 001, 2002 RECESSION. AND YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY NOW IS SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS, HOW DO YOU CREATE JOBS IN THIS GLOBAL ECONOMY. IT'S NOT BY THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED BY MANY WHO ARE SAYING THAT THE  THING WE OUGHT TO DO IS SIMPLY CUT TAXES AND CUT GOVERNMENT. AND JUST AS AN EXAMPLE FROM THE LABORATORY OF DEMOCRACY THAT IS MICHIGAN, IN MY  TERMS AS GOVERNOR, IN MY FIRST TERM I CUT TAXES 99 TIMES. I KNOW MY DETRACKERS ARE GOING TO SAY, OH, NO. AND-- I'M JUST SAYING, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
Jon: CAN I HEAR THE ACCENT THAT YOUR DETRACTORS USE AGAIN, BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS --
CUT A LOT OF TAXES, CUT GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ANY STATE IN NATION. WE HAVE CUT MORE EMPLOYEES, CUT MORE SPENDING. WE WERE 48th IN THE COUNTRY BY THE TIME I LEFT OFFICE IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT. AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH ALL THAT TAX CUTTING, AND WITH ALL THAT SPENDING REDUCTION, REDUCING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT, THAT WE WOULD  BE NUMBER ONE IN EMPLOYMENT, RIGHT. IF THAT WERE THE SOLUTION. BUT ALAS, WE WERE THE NUMBER ONE IN UNEMPLOYMENT FOR MANY YEARS IN THE PAST DECADE. WHY? SOMETHING ELSE WAS GOING ON. AND IT WAS THAT THE STRUCTURE OF OUR ECONOMY WAS CHANGING BECAUSE OF GLOBAL EVASION. AND THOSE OLD THEORIES WERE NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS NEW 21st CENTURY GLOBAL ECONOMY  WHERE WE ARE COMPETING AGAINST CHINA AND INDIA AND OTHER PLACES.
Jon: THIS IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY YESTERDAY TO THE GENTLEMAN, WAS-- YOU COULD OFFER --
GOVERNOR DANIELS.
Jon: GOVERNOR DANIELS, AND YOU CAN OFFER ZERO PERCENT TAX RATE TO CORPORATIONS AND THAT STILL  DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE THEIR iPHONES, THE PARTS ANYPLACE BUT CHINA. SO IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, WHAT DO WE DO AND HOW DO THESE-- DON'T YOU THINK  THESE CORPORATIONS BEGIN TO LOOK AT US AS DESPERATE SUITORS IN THEY ARE NOW THE  ONLY GIRL AT AN ALL-MALE BOARDING SCHOOL. AND IT'S JUST LIKE WELL, HE GAVE ME A CORVETTE, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO.
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS STATE TO STATE RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S TRUE COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. BUT NO STATE HAS THE ABILITY TO COMPETE AGAINST CHINA. THERE HAS GOT TO BE A PARTNERSHIP. IN FACT, YOU KNOW, THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS IN MICHIGAN AND THE REASON WHY IN 2010  THINGS STARTED TO TURN AROUND, WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT THERE YET, BELIEVE ME. BUT WE STOPPED THE DROP. WE STARTED TO CLIMB OUT, OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPPED SIX TIMES FASTER THAN THE  NATIONAL AVERAGE IN 2010, WHY? BECAUSE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO  COMPETE FOR FEDERAL GRANTS AND WE PUT STATE TAX INCENTIVES AND UNIVERSITIES FOR THE BATTERY FOR THE  ELECTRIC VEHICLE, FOR EXAMPLE. WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE LITHIUM ION BATTERY WHICH PREVIOUSLY WAS ALL IN ASIA. BUT WE WANTED TO BUILD THE ELECTRIC CAR. YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE GUTS HERE. AND SO WE GOT 18 COMPANIES TO COME TO MICHIGAN, IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THAT INVESTMENT  THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GO. CAN I JUST-- .
Jon: IS IT OKAY IF YOU-- YOU CAN STICK AROUND. WE'LL GO TO COMMERCIAL AND COME BACK AND TALK FOR A LITTLE BIT AND YOU CAN  EXPLAIN THE PUBLIC PRIVATE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I SAID THIS YESTERDAY, TO THE GUY, YOU KNOW, THEY MAY WANT TO INSIST THAT  CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, BUT CORPORATIONS ARE CERTAINLY NOT AMERICANS. AND THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY TO --
SO GOVERNOR, ON THE BOOK SHELVES
