Jon: WELCOME BACK. OH, I WAS SO ANGRY ABOUT THE  SEQUESTRATION THIS WEEKEND I  NEEDED SOME CHEERING UP. LUCKILY THE SUNDAY NEWS SHOWS  PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED LEVITY. MITT ROMNEY IN HIS FIRST  INTERVIEW SINCE LOSING LAST  NOVEMBER AND DENNIS RODMAN IN HIS FIRST EXPERIENCE VIEW  VISITING NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM  JONG U.N. TWO MEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT  WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED TO  THEY. TO THE COMPLOAMCY MOBILE, HOW  DID DENNIS RODMAN END UP IN  NORTH KOREA.
IF YOU ARE BONDERRING OUT  THERE WHY KIM JONG U.N. -- JONG  UN AND RODMAN GOT TOGETHER HE WAS A BIG FAN OF BULLS IN THE  80s.
Jon: THAT'S Y. I THOUGHT HE  WAS MAYBE A HUGE FAN OF DOUBLE  TEAM AND JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME. BEING A FAN OF THE BULLS IS LIKE  A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA HOW FAR THE  ROSTER DO YOU WORK TO GET DOWN TO THE WORM? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? YOU KNOW MJ AND PIP YEN --  PIPPEN AREN'T GOING. THEY COULDN'T GUT LUY LONGLY OR  DLUC LONGLEY OR KERR. LET'S GO TO ROMNEY.
THE WEAKNESS THE CAMPAIGN  HAD, THAT I HAD, WAS WE WRNLT  EFFECTIVE TO TAKE THE MESSAGE TO MINORITY VOTERS. THAT WAS A REAL WEAKNESS.
Jon: BUT RICH WHITE PEOPLE  SEEMED TO LIKE IT ENORMOUSLY. REMIND ME AGAIN GOVERNOR ROMNEY  WHAT WAS THE MESSAGE?
47% WITH HIM WHO DEPEND ON  THE GOVERNMENT VERY MUCH WHO  BELIEVE THEY ARE VICTIMS AND GOVERNMENT HAS RESPONSIBILITY  FOR THEM.
Jon: YOUR MESSAGE, YEAH. I THINK THE PROBLEM WASN'T  GETTING YOUR MESSAGE OUT. THE PROBLEM WAS DESPITE YOUR  BEST EFFORTS IT GOT OUT. ANY THOUGHTS?
VERY UNFORTUNATE STATEMENT  THAT I MADE. WHEN YOU SPEAK IN PRIVATE YOU  DON'T SPEND AS MUCH TIME  THINKING ABOUT HOW SOMETHING COULD BE TWIST AND DISTORTED AND  COME OUT WRONG.
Jon: TWISTED AND DISTORTED. SETTING ASIDE YOU WEREN'T  SPEAKING IN PRIVATE, YOU WERE AT  A BANQUET UNLESS YOUR KITCHEN SEATS 100 -- OKAY, YOU WERE IN  PRIVATE. TWISTED AND DISTORTED IT'S A  TAPE RECORDING OF WHAT YOU SAID. GIVE ME RODMAN. YOU CALLED THEM GREAT LEADERS DO  YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?
WHAT I SAW IN THAT COUNTRY, I  SAW IN THAT COUNTRY PEOPLE  RESPECT HIM AND HIS FAMILY. THAT'S WHAT I MEAN ABOUT THAT.
AREN'T THEY FORCED TO?
WELL, I SAY NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OF COURSE HE'S GOING  TO SAY NO. THEY CLEARLY TORTURED HIM OVER  THERE. THEY LEFT THOSE METALLIC PAIN  DEVICES -- SORRY, I'M TOLD  THAT'S A DELIBERATE STYLE CHOICE AND THAT DENNIS RODMAN'S MONEY  COACH SHOULD HAVE TIPPED ME OFF. TAKE ME AWAY ROMNEY HOW DID IT  FEEL LOSING.
IT WAS A CRUSHING  DISAPPOINTMENT NOT FOR US. OUR LIVESES ARE GOING TO BE  FINE. IT'S FOR THE COUNTRY. -- OUR LIVES ARE GOING TO BE  FINE. IT'S FOR THE COUNTRY.
Jon: YOU HAD FOUR MONTHS TO  COME UP WITH THE ANSWER AND YOU  GO WITH WHAT THE WOMEN ON MAURY USED TO SAY AFTER THEIR FIANCEE  SLEPT WITH THEIR SISTER. I'M NOT SAD FOR ME I'M SAD FOR  YOU BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE HAD  ALL THIS. (bleep). [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] RODNEY?
HE'S A GREAT GUY. A GREAT GUY. IF I SIT DOWN TO TALK TO HIM. THE SUBJECT --
A GREAT GUY WHO PUTS 200,000  PEOPLE IN PRISON CAMPS.
YOU KNOW, WE DO THE SAME  THING HERE. BILL CLINTON CAN HAVE SEX WITH  HIS SECRETARY AND GET AWAY WITH  IT AND STILL BE POWERFUL.
Jon: HERE IS MY IMPRESSION  OF TWO NORTH KOREAN PRISON  INMATES IN DENNIS RODMAN'S  IMAGINATION. DID YOU HEAR THAT U.S. PRESIDENT  WAS BLOWN BY HIS INTERN? WOW, THAT PLACE IS NO BETTER  THAN HERE. YEAH, PRETTY MUCH THE SAME  PLACE. [ LAUGHTER ] REMEMBER THE FIRST OF US WHO  DIES GETS EATEN BY THE OTHER,  RIGHT? HOW DID AMBASSADOR ROD  MINNESOTA'S COMPLETE LACK OF  FOREIGN POLICY KNOWLEDGE NOT COME OUT IN THE CONFIRMATION  HEARING? I DON'T KNOW. LET'S GET A SIMPLE MOMENT, MAYBE  SOMETHING ABOUT THE FAMILY.
MATT AND CRAIG LIVE CLOSE TO  AN OPEN SPACE AREA. WE THROW THE BALLS TO THE DOGS. WE PLAY SPORTS WITH THE KIDS. THEY LICK KICK BALLS, HITTING  BASEBALLS. WE DO WHAT GRANDPARENTS ARE  EXPECTED TO DO WITH GRAND KIDS.
Jon: DO YOU SEE WHY YOU  SNROFT I'M NOT SUGGEST YOU DON'T  HAVE A WONDERFUL AND WARM RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR FAMILY  AND GRANDCHILDREN IN THESE OPEN  SPACE AREAS -- [LAUGHTER] -- BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND  THAT WE HUMANS -- [LAUGHTER] -- WE CALL THEM PARKS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN'T DESCRIBE THEM AS "OPEN  SPACE AREAS" AND EXPECT TO WIN  ELECTIONS BECAUSE HUMANS TEND TO VOTE FOR OTHER HUMANS. BUT IN THE END, SUNDAY MORNING'S  EPIC BATTLE TO MISCONSTRUE BASIC  HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS TO HAD TO GO TO DENNIS RODMAN WHO HAD ONE  FORM FOR THE ONE FAMILY  DICTATORSHIP.
ONE THING I NOTICED ABOUT HIM  HE WAS VERY HUMBLE AS A KID HE'S  VERY HUMBLE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YES, THE 28-YEAR-OLD  WHO CONVENED THIS 100,000 PERSON  MILITARY PARADE IN HIS OWN HONOR IS THE PICTURE OF HUMILITY. YOU KNOW WHAT? I SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE  RODMAN'S ARREST -- ARROGANCE  GAUGE IS THROWN OFF FROM BEING ON CELEBRITY APPRENTICE.
I'M THE LARGEST REAL ESTATE  DEVELOPER IN NEW YORK. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? I'M GOING SUE YOU?  WE'RE GOING  TO SEE THE NICEST APARTMENT IN  NEW  NEW YORK CITY, MY APARTMENT.
Jon: HE SPENT SO MUCH TIME  HANGING OUT WITH TRUMP THAT  COMPARED TO THE GUY THAT THINKS GOD CHOSE HIS FAMILY TO
