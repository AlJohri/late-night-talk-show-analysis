[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, LAST NIGHT WAS THE STATE OF  THE UNION. THE STATE OF UNION REBUTTAL IS  MOVE OFTEN HANDED TO A RISING  PARTY STAR. WHO'S STAR THEN ACCORDING TO  TRADITION QUICKLY FALLS  FOLLOWING THE STATE OF THE UNION  REBUTTAL.
GOOD EVENING AND HAPPY MARDI  GRAS. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [WHISTLING] [LAUGHTER] THIS JEER'S SHORT STRAW WENT TO  MARCO RUBIO BECAUSE HE'S A YOUNG  DYNAMIC LEGISLATOR WITH BOLD IDEAS AND A RHETORICAL FLARE AND  ALSO BECAUSE HE IS HISPANIC. SORRY IS THAT CYNICAL. YOU DON'T THINK THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY WOULD PANDER TO HISPANICS  THAT WAY.
THE TIME HAS COME TO PASS  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  REFORM. NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT.
Jon: WOW, THERE IS SENATOR  JOHN McCAIN UP OFF HIS FEET  CHEERING COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. I'M SURE HE IS NOT DOING THAT TO  PANDER TO HISPANIC VOTES. HOW DID HE FIGURE OUT -- HOW DID  HE FEEL ABOUT THAT BEFORE HE  FIGURED OUT THEY WOULDN'T WIN A NATIONAL ELECTION WITHOUT THAT. WE SHOULD BE WORKING ON  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION RIGHT  NOW. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO WEIRD! AS SOON AS THEY COMPREHENSIVE  IMMIGRATION REFORM THE FLOOR  FELL AND McCAIN EVEN THOUGH HE IS STANDING AND CHEERING CANNOT  BE SEEN. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS ON RUBIO TO BRING WORD OF  THIS ACCEPTING REPUBLICAN PARTY. HIS PERFORMANCE WAS PERHAPS [SPEAK SPANISH] AND SUDDEN IT  WILL STORY WAS THE SELF  DEPORTATION OF MARCO RUBIO'S SALIVA FROM THE INSIDE OF HIS  MOUTH TO THE OUTSIDE OF HIS  FACE. DON'T WIPE. YOU ARE ONLY DRAWING  ATTENTION -- NOT THE SPITTLE. THIS CAN'T END WELL. WELL AS LONG AS YOU DON'T --  NO-O-O-O! DON'T! NO OOOO! WHY? [LAUGHTER] I GOTTA SAY OBAMA TALKED FOR AN  HOUR WITHOUT SUCH AS A SIP. MAY NEED A PROMPTER BUT AT LEAST  HE DOESN'T NEED AN IV BAG. FEW PEOPLE KNOW THIS BUT LOST IN  LAST NIGHT'S -- [LAUGHTER] YEAH? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE WORKED REALLY HARD ON THIS  WHOLE THING. [ LAUGHTER ] AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE LIKE  OH, (bleep) WHAT IS THE TITLE. THROW THAT OUT. ARGGHH. [LAUGHTER] FEW PEOPLE KNOW THIS BUT LOST IN  LAST NIGHT'S HYDRATION DISASTER  WAS THE FACT THAT SENATOR RUBIO ACTUALLY GAVE A SPEECH. THE FIRST NATIONALLY TELEVISED  REPUBLICAN SPEECH SINCE MITT  ROMNEY LOST. THE PICTURE OF BARACK OBAMA DID  NOT MATCH THE BARACK OBAMA MOST  EXPERIENCED. WHAT LESSONS DID THE G.O.P. LEARN?
EA ACCUSED US OF WANTING  DIRTY WATER AND DIRTY AIR AND  HIS FAVORITE ATTACK OF ALL IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO DON'T AGREE  WITH HEM ONLY CARE ABOUT RICH  PEOPLE. BUT ANY TIME THE PEOPLE OPPOSES  THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA HE AND  HIS ALLIES RESPOND BY FALSELY ATTACKING HIS MOTIVES.
Jon:S IT'S SO HURTFUL. IT'S ENOUGH TO MICK A PERSPIRE. I'M SORRY, I MEAN GLOW. [ LAUGHTER ] YES, HOW ALL OF IT IS TO  MISREPRESENT YOUR POLITICAL  OPPONENTS VIEWS AND PROPOSALS. ANYTHING YOU WOULD CARE TO ADD  TO THAT.
OUR FREE ENTERPRISE ECONOMY  IS THE SOURCE OF MIDDLE CLASS  PRORS EXPERT BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA -- PROSPERITY, BUT  PRESIDENT OBAMA BELIEVES IT'S  THE CAUSE OF PROBLEM. I HOPE THE PRESIDENT LOSES THE  ON SEFTION RAISING TAXES AND  INSTEAD TONIGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD TIME TO SAVE MEDICARE.
Jon: INSTEAD OF WHY DIDN'T  HE GO OUT THERE AND SAY  SOMETHING ABOUT MEDICARE. SOMETHING -- WHAT WAS THAT?
I'M MEDICARE I'M PREPARED TO  ENACT REFORMS THAT WILL ACHIEVE  THE SAME AMOUNT OF HEALTH CARE SAVINGS BY THE BEGINNING OF THE  NEXT DECADE AS THOSE PROPOSED BY  THE BIPARTISAN SIMPSON BOWLES  COMMISSION.
Jon: I SEE THE PROBLEM,  ONCE AGAIN RATHER THAN  RESPONDING  RESPONDING TO ACTUAL OBAMA, REPUBLICANS ARE STUCK RESPONDING  TO THE FICTIONAL IMAGE OF OBAMA  THEY CREATED. THE SMAIM BOILERPLATE REPUBLICAN  TALKING POINTS BUT JUST WITH A  BETTER BACKSTORY.
MORE GOVERNMENT ISN'T GOING  TO HELP YOU GET AHEAD. IT'S GOING TO HOLD YOU BACK. MORE GOVERNMENT ISN'T GOING TO  CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES. IT'S GOING TO LIMIT THEM.
Jon: CUE THE SAME  REPUBLICAN IN THE SAME SPEECH  TRYING TO LIMIT YOUR ACCESS TO FEDERAL HELP THAT MANAGED TO  HELP HIM AND NOT HOLD HIM BACK.
I BELIEVE IN FINANCIAL AID. I COULDN'T HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE  WITHOUT IT. MEDICARE IS IMPORTANT TO ME. IT'S THE SAME MEDICARE MY MOTHER  RECEIVES RIGHT NOW.
Jon: BUT I POINT IS  (bleep) IT. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE -- I DON'T KNOW -- IT  MAKES YOU DEPENDENT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? REPUBLICANS LITTLE TIP, AS YOU  ARE FEELING AROUND FOR A NEW  PARTY STRATEGY IF PAUL RYAN DOESN
