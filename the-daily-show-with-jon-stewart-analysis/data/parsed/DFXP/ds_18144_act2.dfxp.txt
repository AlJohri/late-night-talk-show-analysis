WELCOME BACK. THIS SUMMER HAS BEEN SO MUCH  FUN. COY NOT HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT  THE OTHER CORRESPONDENTS. THEY HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY  SUPPORTIVE THE WHOLE TIME. LET'S GO OUT TO THEM NOW ONE  LAST TIME. STARTING WITH SALMON THAT  BEE IN DETROIT, SAM, ANY  UPDATES? I KNOW THINGS ARE PRETTY  GRIM OVER THERE.
OH, JOHN T IS WORSE THAN  YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE.
RIGHT.
A ONCE PROUD AMERICAN  INSTITUTION BROUGHT TO ITS  KNEES BY GROSS MISMANAGEMENT AND INCOMPETENT LEADERSHIP. YOU KNOW, YOU WONDER IF IT  WILL EVER AGAIN BE THE ICON  IT WAS ONCE.
BUT SAM, ON THE OTHER  HAND, DETROIT IS RESILIENT,  WILL WILL BOUNCE BACK, SHORTLY OPINIONS DETROIT, NO,  I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DAILY  SHOW.
COME ON.
IT TOOK DECADES TO BRING  DETROIT TO ITS KNEES BUT YOU  DESTROYED THE DAILY SHOW IN LIKE THREE MONTHS.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. GO A LITTLE EASY.
YOU'RE FASTER THAN EBOLA. WHAT?
I WOULD SAY THAT I'M  SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER BUT  YOU HAVE TO POWER AND WHATEVER POWER YOU THOUGHT  YOU HAD ENDS IN ABOUT SIX  MINUTES WHICH IS LESS TIME THAN IT TAKES TO MAKE A HOT  POCKET, BUT ENOUGH TIME I'M  SURE FOR YOU TO [BLEEP] THE SHOW EVEN FURTHER UNTIL IT  BEGS TO BE PUT OUT OF ITS  MISSERY.
THANK YOU, SAMANTHA. LET'S GO TO JESSICA WILLIAMS,  JESS, WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU.
I'M IN FRONT OF PAULA  DEEN'S HOUSE, JOHN.
THAT IS ENCOURAGING. ANY DOVMENTS ON THAT STORY?
OH, NO, I'M ACTUALLY JUST  HERE LOOKING FOR A JOB.
WHAT?
BECAUSE LET ME BE CLEAR,  I WOULD MUCH RATHER WORK FOR  AN OLD LADY WHO ADMITTED TO THROWING THE "N" WORD AROUND  THAN SPEND SIX MORE MINUTES  WORKING FOR YOU.
WOW, THAT SEEMS A LITTLE  EXTREME, JESS.
OH MY GOSH, DOES IT,  JOHN.
A LITTLE.
WELL, THEN, LET ME JUST  SAY ONE MORE THING.
SURE GO AHEAD.
[BLEEP] YOU!
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, THERE  IS NOT EXACTLY HOW I  ENVISAGED MY FINAL SHOW  GOING, TO BE HONEST AM BUT APPARENTLY WE ACTUALLY HAVE  ANOTHER REPORTER WHO IS LIVE  AT THE MOSCOW AIRPORT, MAYBE SNOWDEN IS ON THE MOVE. WHO'S THERE, WHAT?  --
JOHN  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WYATT, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN  DOING SINCE YOU LEFT THE  SHOW?
I'VE BEEN GREAT. I FEEL LIKE A GUY WHO HAD A  PARTICULAR FOR THE TITANIC  BUT GOT ON BOARD AND SAID YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS DOESN'T  FEEL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO  TAKE A PLANE.
THAT DOESN'T WORK. THAT DOESN'T WORK, THAT  ANALOGY, THERE WEREN'T  PLANES IN 1912.
I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] ABOUT THAT, JOHN, IT'S WHY I  LEFT. THE POINT IS I AVOIDED  CRASHING INTO THE ICEBERG  THAT WOULD HAVE LEFT ME  FLOATING IN THIS [BLEEP] SHOW. BUT NOW FOOD TASTES BETTER,  THE SUN IS BRIGHTER. I JUST WISH COY HAVE SAVED  THE OTHERS, THAT'S WHAT  REALLY --
WHAT, WYATT, THAT'S WHY  YOU'RE FILING THIS REPORT TO  TELL ME THAT I RUINED THIS  SHOW.
JOHN, I'M HERE BECAUSE  I'M YOUR FRIEND.
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW WHEN A  SKATEBOARDER TRIES TO DO A  TRICK OVER A WALL AND HE  CAN'T HANDLE IT.
YEAH.
HE LANDS ON HIS BALLS. AND HE'S JUST LYING THERE  WITH HIS BALLS HURTING.
YEAH, I GET T I GET.
I'M THE FRIEND WHO COMES  OVER TO SEE IF HE'S OKAY AND  I ALSO MAKE SURE I GET THE WHOLE THING ON VIDEO.
OKAY, WELL-- THAT'S VERY  GENEROUS OF YOU WYATT, I  APPRECIATE IT I HAVE GOT TO GO TO JASON JONES NOW, HE IS  LIVE IN LONDON, OH, HE'S NOT,  HE'S NOT, MAYBE HE JUST CAN'T EVEN BE BOTHERED TO BE  THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHOA.
ENOUGH OF THAT [BLEEP].
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NO WAY, NO WAY! NO WAY! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THAT'S GREAT OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? >>.
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH, ENOUGH  OF WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. LEAVE JOHN OLIVER A LOCHBLT  HE'S DOING A HECK OF A JOB,  I'M PROUD OF YOU.
ROB, THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE  SHOW THIS SUMMER?
NO.
NOT REALLY MY THING. I'M MORE OF A WIPEOUT KIND  OF GUY. NOW THAT'S A SHOW.
WIPEOUT, YOU MEAN THE  SHOW WHERE PEOPLE RUB ACROSS  INFLATABLE --
SPOILER ALERT. COME ON! I DIDN'T GET TO WATCH LAST  WEEK'S EPISODE. IT'S ON MY TiVO THOUGH.
OKAY, SORRY. SO WHY ARE YOU IN LONDON,  EXACTLY?
WELL, BASICALLY, JUST TO  GAUGE THE MOOD ON THE  STREET. TO SEE WHAT THE PEOPLE IN  YOUR HOMELAND THINK. I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST, THEY  HATE YOU.
I'M HEARING A LOT OF  THINGS LIKE THIS, LIKE HE'S  AN EMBARRASSMENT, HE IS AND TOSS ANOTHER SHRIMP ON THE  BARBY.
THAT IS AUSTRALIAN FOR A  START.
I THINK I KNOW MY  EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, JOHN.
THAT'S NOT EVEN YOURS.
9 POINT IS THIS, THIS  COUNTRY IS IN A TAILSPIN.
NO, IT'S NOT.
TAILSPIN OF SHAME.
SI HAVE TALKED TO SEVERAL  PEOPLE ON THE STREETS AND  HERE IS WHAT THEY ARE CALLING YOU AND I WROTE IT  DOWN SO BEAR WITH ME.
OKAY.
THE UNION JACK-- ASS.
BUCKINGHAM FALL --
THEY DIDN'T A THAT.
THE [BLEEP] THAT RUINED  THE DAILY SHOW.
WHOA, YOU CANNOT SAY THAT  WORD.
APPARENTLY HERE YOU CAN. PEOPLE SAY IT TO ME LIKE SIX,  SEVEN TIMES A DAY. BUT IF YOU ASK ME YOU'VE  BEEN DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB  AS A HOST.
THAT MEANS ABSOLUTELY  NOTHING COMING FROM YOU. YOU JUST TOLD ME YOU HAVEN'T  WATCHED IT ALL SUMMER.
GEE, LEARN TO TAKE A  COMPLIMENT, JOHN, KEEP UP  ITS GOOD WORK. I'M PROUD OF YOU.
THIS IS MY LAST SHOW  HOSTING.
OOH, THAT SUCTION. HEY, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR  WORK YOU SHOULD GET ON  WIPEOUT. NOW THAT'S A SHOW. PLUS EVERYONE WOULD LOVE TO  SEE YOU GET SMASHED IN YOUR  STUPID BRITISH FACE.
NO, THEY WOULDN'T.
OH, LOOK AT ME --
ROB, THANK YOU.
