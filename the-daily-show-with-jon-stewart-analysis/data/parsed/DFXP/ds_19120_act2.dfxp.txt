WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. IT'S VERY RARE THAT I FEEL LIKE WE COIN A PHRASE ON THIS PROGRAM, BUT IF BRING ME MY SMELLING TURDS DOESN'T CATCH ON, I'M JUST, I'M JUST GOING TO BE SAD. THAT'S ALL. BUT WELCOME BACK. AS AMERICANS IT'S, OF COURSE, OUR DUTY TO TAKE SIDES IN EVERY CONFLICT. BUT SOMETIMES THE CHOICE IS VERY DIFFICULT. HOUSE REPUBLICANS VERSUS THE I.R.S. I DON'T KNOW. ALEC BALDWIN VERSUS PAPARAZZI. I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE. PAULA DEEN VERSUS DIABETES. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. WHO DO YOU CHOOSE? AND NOW ANOTHER BATTLE LOOMS.
WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THIS HALF HOUR WITH THAT SHOWDOWN BETWEEN TWO POWERFUL MEN, DONALD TRUMP AND CHICAGO MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL.
OH, IT'S A BADGER FIGHTING A MONGOOSE. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO TO CHEER FOR. GET ME MY SMELLING TURDS.
THE STAKES: FIVE 20-FOOT HIGH STAINLESS STEEL LETTERS SPELLING OUT TRUMP'S NAME ON HIS 96-STORY CONDO AND HOTEL TOWER. AT NIGHT IT GLOWS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DONALD TRUMP NEEDS A P. I GUESS, I GUESS THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM, IS IT?
I THINK THE SIGN SCARS THAT ARCHITECTURE, ARCHITECTURE BEAUTY AND TASTE WITH A TASTELESS SIGN.
CHICAGO MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL HAS ASKED HIS STAFF TO SEE IF THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO REMOVE OR AT LEAST SHRINK IT.
Jon: RAHM, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IS THE SMALL SIZE. YOU DON'T WANT KNOW WHAT THE LARGE TRUMP SIGN LOOKS LIKE. YEAH. NO SURPRISE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. YOU MENTION DONALD TRUMP'S NAME, HE APPEARS ON YOUR TELEVISION. HE'S LIKE BEETLEJUICE, BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TO SAY TRUMP'S NAME ONCE, AND THERE'S NO WAY TO MAKE HIM GO AWAY.
IT'S A VERY HIGH-QUALITY, VERY BEAUTIFUL SIGN THAT I THINK ENHANCES THE BUILDING GREATLY. IT'S A VERY HIGH-LEVEL SIGN. IT'S DONE IN THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF TASTE.
Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU TELL RAHM, "I COULD HAVE PUT TITS ON THE SIGN. I DID NOT. I COULD HAVE PUT A GIRL IN A VIKING HELMET ON THE SIGN. I DIDN'T, CAUSE IT'S CLASSY. THE FONT, THE WHOLE THING, CLASSY." [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT, DONALD, IT'S A SIGN. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE BEST SIGN EVER. IT JUST HAS TO IDENTIFY YOU AS THE OWNER OF THE BUILDING, SO I GUESS YOUR ROOMMATE DOESN'T EAT IT, BUT LOOK, I'M NOT AN ARCHITECTURE CRITIC.
BLAIR KAMIN, THE "CHICAGO TRIBUNE'S" PULITZER PRIZE WINNING ARCHITECTURAL CRITIC IS LEADING THE CHARGE AGAINST THE SIGN. YOU'VE CALLED THIS SIGN A WART.
YES, A WART IS PUTTING IT POLITELY I THINK.
Jon: WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE PUTTING IT POLITELY BECAUSE NOW CHICAGO ARCHITECTURE CRITIC JUST DOING YOUR JOB, YOU HAVE ENTERED THE TRUMP-A-GON.
THIS WAS STARTED BY A THIRD-RATE ARCHITECTURAL CRITIC FOR "THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE" WHO I THOUGHT GOT FIRED. HE WAS GONE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEPED] IS WRONG WITH YOU? DO YOU HAVE TO ANSWER EVERYBODY? HOW MUCH TIME IS THERE FOR YOU IN DAY? I THOUGHT YOU WERE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN? IS THERE NO SLIGHT SMALL ENOUGH FOR YOU TO JUST [BLEEPED] LET IT GO. REMOVE THE GOOGLE NEWS ALERT FOR YOUR NAME. NOW, THIS POOR ARCHITECTURE CRITIC HAS TO GO ON AND DEFEND HIS REPUTATION.
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE GUTTER WITH DONALD TRUMP. I HAVE A PULITZER PRIZE. I WASN'T FIRED FROM MY JOB. I WAS ON A SABBATICAL AT HARVARD.
Jon: YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU? [LAUGHTER] DONALD TRUMP ISN'T IMPRESSED BY THE HARVARD OR PULITZER. THE ONLY NAME THAT IMPRESSES DONALD TRUMP IS HIS OWN NAME. UNLESS YOU HAVE "TRUMP" ACROSS YOUR FOREHEAD, HE DOESN'T GIVE A [BLEEPED]. I GOTTA SAY, CHICAGO, I THINK THIS IS ON YOU. DID YOU NOT THINK DONALD TRUMP WAS GOING TO PUT HIS NAME ON THE BUILDING YOU LET HIM BUILD? IT'S WHAT HE DOES. HAVE YOU BEEN TO NEW YORK, OR AS YOU THINK IT WOULD BE CALLED FROM THE BUILDINGS, NEW TRUMP CITY. HE PUT UP A STRING OF APARTMENT TOWERS THAT LITERALLY BLOCK THE SUN FROM THE ENTIRE UPPER WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN. "HEY, HEY, IT'S THE CLASSIEST, MOST LUXURIOUS GLOOM THE CITY HAS EVER SEEN." EVERYONE KNOWS THE FIRST THING DONALD TRUMP DOES AFTER FINISHING A BUILDING IS SPRAY HIS NAME-JIZZ ALL OVER IT. HE PAID A LOT TO ERECT THAT BUILDING. OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO HAVE HIS MONEY SHOT. JUST BE THANKFUL HE DIDN'T USE HIS BIRTH NAME. YEAH, THAT LOOKS GOOD. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
