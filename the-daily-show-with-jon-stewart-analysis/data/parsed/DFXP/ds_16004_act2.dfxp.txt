Jon: WELCOME BACK. EVERYBODY HERE WE'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH FACEBOOK. IT'S A WEB SITE THE KIDS USE TO COORDINATE WHICH MALT SHOP TO MEET UP AT THEIR SOCK HOP. I'M OLD! [LAUGHTER] AND, OF COURSE, THOSE KIDS PARENTS USE IT TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT LOOKING AT WHAT THEIR HIGH  SCHOOL GIRLFRIENDS ARE UP TO CREATING HEART FELT FRIEND REQUEST MESSAGES ONLY TO DELETE  THEM UNSENT. LIFE IS HARD. FACEBOOK HAS REACHED A STAGE. THE OBVIOUS MOVE IS PUBLIC.
MARK ZUCKERBERG THE FOUNDER SAID DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATHE  BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY ONCE YOU GO PUBLIC AND HAVE SHAREHOLDERS TO ANSWER  TO YOU HAVE TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT. IT'S SOMETHING MR. ZUCKERBERG DOESN'T WANT TO DO.
Jon: WHAT THE (bleep). THAT MEANS I HAVE TO UPDATE MY FACEBOOK STATUS TO I'M PERPLEXED SEE THAT'S --  [LAUGHTER] HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT. THE GUY WHOSE IMMENSE SUCCESS IS FOUNDED ON MINING OUR PERSONAL DATA. THE GUY WHO SHARES MY PHOTOS UNLESS I CHANGE MY PRIVACY EVERY HALF HOUR. I HAVE TO CHANGE MY STATUS TO FRUSTRATED AND I'LL UNDERSCORE THAT WITH A KITTEN CLIP ART  STUCK IN A KLEENEX BOX. NOTHING SAYS -- THIS WORKS AMAZINGLY EVEN WHEN YOUR COMPUTER ISN'T ON. MAYBE HE HAS FORGOTTEN WHAT HE IS HE AT NERD FEST 2008.
AS MORE AND MORE INFORMATION IS SHARED THERE'S A CLEAR TREND TOWARDS THAT. I VIEW IT AS A PART OF FACEBOOK'S ROLE IN THIS ECOSYSTEM TO CONTINUE PUSHING THAT. MAKING IT SO MORE PEOPLE ARE SHARING INFORMATION. IF WE'RE NOT ON THE EDGE AFTER THIS PUSHING THAT OUT THEN I  DON'T THINK WE'RE DOING OUR JOB.
Jon: WE WILL NOT REST UNTIL EVERYONE IS WALK ASH NAKED HOLDING A PASSPORT SHOUTING OUT  THEIR CHILDREN'S NAMES AND LOCATION BUT DON'T LOOK AT OUR FINANCIAL BOOKS. I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU FACEBOOK. THE S.E.C. HAS STRICT RULES ABOUT DISCLOSURE. GOOD LUCK GETTING AROUND THAT.
FACEBOOK IS TAKING A PUBLIC INVESTMENT $500 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS $450 MILLION COMING FROM GOLDMAN SACHS.
Jon: GOLDMAN! AS WELL AS SAVES. [LAUGHTER] WHEN IT COMES TO WEASELING AROUND FINANCIAL REGULATIONS THEY ARE THE MASTERS. WHAT DID THESE (bleep) DO NOW?
THE INVESTMENT BANK WILL CREATE A SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE THAT ALLOWS OTHERS TO INVEST IN  FACEBOOK INCORRECTRY. IT HELPS FACEBOOK BYPASS AN S.E.C. REGULATION REQUIRING COMPANIES WITH MORE THAN 499  INVESTORS TO DISCLOSE THEIR FINANCIAL RESULTS TO THE PUBLIC.
REPRESENTING AS ONE INVESTOR WHEN IT MIGHT BE REPRESENTING THOUSANDS.
Jon: GOLDMAN, IS THERE ANY REGULATIONS INTENT YOU CAN'T SUBVERT. EXCUSE ME, I'M UNFRIENDING GOLDMAN SACHS. IS THAT THE TERMINOLOGY? I DON'T KNOW. ALL OF THIS IS MAKING ME WONDER WHAT FACEBOOK IS TRYING TO HIDE. MAYBE I'LL TYPE IN I WONDER WHAT FACEBOOK IS TRYING TRYING TO HIDE. WHY WOULD THERE PRIVATE SNAPSHOT BE ANY MORE DAMAGING THAN OF US. IT'S A MONEY FIGHT THEY ARE HAVING. A CASH BOND FIRE AND THAT IS SOMEONE (bleep) A PILE OF MONEY. UNFRIEND. UNFRIEND. TRANSPARENCY IS NOT THE BEST THING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
