Jon: WELCOME BACK. IN A FEW MINUTES, WE'RE ACTUALLY... VERY EXCITING. IN A FEW MINUTES WE'LL BE CHATTING WITH LONDON MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON. BUT FIRST A POLITICAL STORY THAT'S JUST BEEN UNCOVERED OUT OF ENGLAND INVOLVING THEIR PRIME  MINISTER
DOWNING STREET HAS CONFIRMED THAT DAVID CAMMERON MISTAKENLY  LEFT HIS EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER IN A PUB
THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS WIFE GOT HOME, THEY NOTICED ONE OF THEIR BROOD WAS STILL MISSING. CAMMERON THOUGHT NANCY WAS WITH HIS WIFE. HIS WIFE THOUGHT THEIR DAUGHTER WAS WITH HIM. WHAT A MIX-UP.
Jon: THE SECRET SERVICE MESSING AROUND WITH COLUMBIAN PROSTITUTES. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY NEVER DID, LEFT MALIA IN AN APPLE BEE'S. FOR MORE ON THIS WE GO TO JOHN OLIVER IN ENGLAND. JOHN, THANKS FOR JOINING US RIGHT NOW. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: JOHN, WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU?
JON I'M AT CHETCINGTON CIRCLE NEAR SACKS TON-ON-WALLOBY.
Jon: THAT'S NOT A REAL PLACE, IS IT?
DO YOU KNOW THAT FOR SURE? Jon: NO. WHY DON'T YOU SHUT THE  [BLEEP] UP, JON
Jon: THE PRIME MINISTER FORGETTING HIS EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. I MEAN THAT'S GOT TO BE A HUGE SCANDAL
NOT REALLY, JON. IN BRITAIN BEING LEFT BY YOUR PARENT IS A HALLOWED RITE OF PASSAGE. WHEN EVERY CHILD REACHES EIGHT YEARS OF AGE THEY ARE ABANDONED BY THEIR FAMILY AND FORCED TO  FEND FOR THEMSELVES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. IT'S LIKE OUR RUMSPRINGER, A COMING OF AGE, AN ORPHAN MITZVAH, IF YOU WILL
Jon: TO LEAVE AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD CHILD ALONE IN A PUB, SHE MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIFIED
AT LEAST HE LEFT HER IN A NICE PUB, JON. OH, THE PLOW AT CAMDDEN, TRUST ME, JON. THERE ARE FAR LESS REPUTABLE ESTABLISHMENTS SHE COULD HAVE BEEN LEFT IN LIKE THE WITCH'S  CHOOTCH OR THE. I MYSELF WAS LEFT IN THE RAT AND PEDOPHILE. THAT'S A ROUGH JOINT, JON. THAT'S A ROUGH JOINT. BUT I WILL SAY THEIR SUNDAY BRUNCH IS SURPRISINGLY GOOD.
Jon: I HAVE HEARD THAT. AT EIGHT YEARS OLD, ALL BRITISH CHILDREN HAVE TO TEMPORARY BECOME AN ORPHAN
YEAH. Jon: HOW DO THEY SURVIVE? YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE OPTIONS. YOU CAN JOIN A PICK POCKET GANG. OTHERS BECOME CHIMNEY SWEEPS. MORE RECENTLY HE SEE A LOT OF KIDS ENROLLING IN WIZARD ACADEMIES.   ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. THEY CAN ONLY PERFORM JOBS THEY'VE SEEN BRITISH CHILDREN DO IN MOVIES
THAT'S BASICALLY IT. THE POINT IS, JON, HAVING THESE HARROWING EXPERIENCES AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY  REPRESSING THEM GIVES US THE EMOTIONAL SCAR TISSUE THAT DEFINES THEM AT QUINTESSENTIALALLY BRITISH.
Jon: THAT SOUNDS AWFUL NOT AT ALL, JON. AS WE SAY IN BRITAIN, WHEN YOU GET LEFT IN A PUB DON'T BE GLUM. CHIN UP, CHUM. BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO FEND FOR YOURSELF
Jon: HE'S GOING TO SING ♪ LEARN TO PICK A POCKET, CLEAN A  CHIMNEY, MATCH A LOCKET ♪♪ AND YOU'LL BE FINE. IT'S REAL HE'LL KIND OF FUNNY ALL THE WAYS YOU CAN MAKE MONEY. WALKING DOWN A BLOCK, AN OLD MAN PAYS YOU TO SUCK HIS...
Jon: OKAY. I THINK WE UNDERSTAND THE IDEA YOU'RE GOING FOR.
IT'S A SONG, JON. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? IT'S A SONG.
Jon: FINE. THE POINT IS, JON, WHEN YOU'RE AN ORPHAN, YOU 'AVE TO  'EARN TO 'ELP 'OUR SELF.
Jon: YOU'RE LOSING YOUR CONSONANTS. JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY.
