FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW WITH  JON STEWART. I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE BACK ON  THE AIR. ALL RIGHT. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED OUR SHOW,  WE WERE ON A LITTLE BIT OF A  HIATUS IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS BECAUSE WE POSSESS THE SAME WORK  ETHIC AS CHILDREN IN THE PRIVATE  SCHOOL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU  BECAUSE WHILE WE WERE GONE IN  JUST THREE WEEKS EVERYTHING HAPPENED EVER. TRAGEDIES, INCOMPETENCY. I DON'T KNOW EVEN KNOW WHERE TO [BLEEP] START TONIGHT. GUN DEBATE? HILLARY CLINTON'S FAKE FAKE  BRAIN BLOOD CLOT? BARACK OBAMA IS FILLING UP HIS  CABINET WITH OLD WHITE GUYS AND  REPUBLICANS LIKE CHUCK HAGEL? MEANWHILE SOME REPUBLICANS ARE  UP WITH THE HAGEL PICK BECAUSE  OF HIS POSSIBLE ANTIGAY VIEWS. THE DEMOCRATS ARE FILLING IN  WITH THE OLD WHITE GUYS AND THE  REPUBLICANS ARE HELPING THE THE  GAYS. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE  DAILY SHOW IS GOING TO DO WITH  THAT STORY. THERE'S NO TIME. THERE'S TOO MUCH. DAM DAMN YOU MAYANS. WHY COULDN'T THE WORLD HAVE  ENDED WHEN YOU SAID IT WAS GOING  TO END BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WAS PLANNING ON. NOW I'VE GOT THREE TRILLION CANS  OF CREAMED CORN IN MY BASEMENT. WAAA! WE'RE GOING TO GET TO ALL THAT  IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO BECAUSE  AFTER THAT WE HAVE A TWO-MONTH MIDWINTER HIATUS. BUT WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE. HERE WE GO. OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT, WORLD  RENOWN THES PEE AND GERARD  DEPARDIEU HAS DECIDED TO DEPART  FRANCE. (MUMBLING) WE BEGIN WHERE WE  LEFT OFF: DANGLING TENUOUSLY ON  THE PRECIPICE OF THE FISCAL  CLIFF. COULD PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA  PULL AMERICA BACK FROM THE  CHASM? WOULD HOUSE SPEAKER BOEHNER'S  DOOMSDAY MACHINE BE STOPPED IN  TIME? WHO REALLY FATHERED NANCY  PELOSI'S LOVE CHILD? I'M GOING WITH ECCENTRIC  BILLIONAIRE LUCIUS TRENT. YOU KNOW HE'S ALSO BATMAN. ALL THESE QUESTIONS WILL BE  ANSWERED BUT FIRST LET'S GET  CAUGHT UP ON WHAT THIS FISCAL CLIFF IS AGAIN. I KNOW YOU'VE ALL BEEN HOLED UP  ON VACATION THE LAST THREE WEEKS  WITH YOUR WIFE, TWO CHILDREN AND LIFE COUNSELING. THE FISCAL CLIFF IS THE ECONOMIC  CATASTROPHE THAT WOULD OCCUR  WITH THE SIMULTANEOUS EXPIRING OF THE BUSH TAX CUTS AND DEEP  ACROSS-THE-BOARD SPENDING CUTS  THAT CONGRESS SCHEDULED TO KICK IN JANUARY 1 SO CONGRESS  COULDN'T NEGOTIATE A FISCAL  SOLUTION BY JANUARY 1. CONFUSED? LET ME PUT IT IN TERMS OF A  21st CENTURY ANALOGY THAT  CAN CRYSTALLIZE THE POINT OF IT. PRETEND AMERICA IS A SUCCESSFUL  RAILROAD COMPANY. THAT HAS FALLEN ON SOME HARD  FISCAL TIMES. THERE'S AN ARGUMENT WITHIN THE  COMPANY ABOUT WHETHER TO MAKE  SOME CHANGES TO THE DINING CAR OFFERING, MAYBE CUT FARES FOR  LESS WEALTHY RIDERS OR ON THE  OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT WHERE TRAINS THEMSELVES ARE STEEL  BEASTS THAT STALIN INVENTED TO  KILL FREEDOM AND MARTHA  WASHINGTON. THIS IS CLEARLY A LARGE GAP TO  BRIDGE IN NEGOTIATIONS THEY  ADDED WHAT WE CALL IN THE MOVIE BUSINESS THE TICKING CLOCK IN  THE FORM OF A DAM SELL TIED TO  THE TRACK. THE DAMSELL IN THIS CASE  REPRESENTING OUR ENTIRE ECONOMY. YES, WE TIED A WOMAN TO THE  TRACK. TO FORCE US TO DEAL WITH THE  TRAIN. SO THE STAGE WAS SET FOR SERIOUS  PEOPLE TO ARRIVE AT A SERIOUS  SOLUTION. SERIOUSLY.
A LOT OF PARTISAN RHETORIC ON  BOTH SIDES, TALKS ON THE FISCAL  CLIFF ARE NOW AT A STANDSTILL. (TRAIN WHISTLE)
Jon: TRAIN  THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL  WOULD RAISE TACKS ON FAMILIES  EARNING $4,000 A YEAR AND  HIGHER. THAT'S UP FROM $250,000 HE  INITIALLY PROPOSED WHILE CUTTING  $930 BILLION IN SPENDING
Jon: AN OPENING BID AND ONLY  13 DAYS UNTIL THE TRAIN RUN OVER  THAT WOMAN
BOEHNER ARGUES TAXES AND CUTS  NEED TO BE EQUAL. HE IS MOVING AHEAD WITH A  TOMORROW ON WHAT HE CALLS  PLAN-B.
Jon: PLAN-B? THE MORNING AFTER BILL? (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   PLAN-B IS THE BILL YOU INTRODUCE  TO MITIGATE YOUR PREVIOUS SESSION'S IRRESPONSIBLE  BEHAVIOR. LET'S HEAR IT
REPUBLICAN BILL THAT WOULD  PREVENT INCOME TAXES FROM GOING  UP ON JANUARY 1 FOR ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $1 MILLION A  YEAR.
Jon: YOU MEAN EVERYBODY? ALL RIGHT. IT'S A STARTING POINT. AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER SOMEONE  HAS TO SAVE PENELOPE. I GUESS WE'LL SETTLE BETWEEN  $400,000 AND A MILLION
A SHOCKER ON CAPITOL HILL  LAST NIGHT AS HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN  BOEHNER'S PLAN-B BACKFIRED
BOEHNER PULLED REPUBLICANS  INTO A MEETING, TRIED TO GET THE  VOTES HE NEEDED BUT FAILED.
Jon: WE JUST LOST OUR BRAKES. ALL RIGHT. I FORGOT ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS. THEY HATE TRAINS AND THINK  TRAINS HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING  INVOLVED IN TRANSPORTATION. WE'RE GOING OVER THE CLIFF. UNLESS...
McCONNELL CALLED FOR HELP  PHONING VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WHO  CAME TO THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY AND IS NOW PART OF THE TALKS.
Jon: OH, GREAT. SOMEBODY CALLED DR. FEEL-GOOD TO  THE HOUSE. THAT WILL WORK. HEY, JOEY CREST-STRIP GET IN  HERE. HE'LL COME IN, FLASH THE PEARLY  WHITES, GOOSE A COUPLE OF  INTERNS. GOOD PLAN [BLEEP].
BREAKING NEWS ON THE FISCAL  CLIFF. THE SENATE APPROVED A  LAST-MINUTE DEAL OVERNIGHT
Jon: OH, MY... I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE DOING  THAT. THINK WE WERE DOING A TRAIN  ANALOGY, WERE WE NOT? FIRST DAY BACK, PEOPLE. NOT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO MATCH  UP. BUT WE DID IT. WE MADE A DEAL. I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR ABOUT THIS  AMAZING DEAL
NEW HIGHER RATES WOULD HIT  THOSE EARNING ABOVE $400,000 A  YEAR. $450,000 FOR COUPLES.
Jon: WOW. REPUBLICANS' CRAFTY NEGOTIATING  GOT OBAMA TO MOVE FROM HIS  $400,000 A YEAR OFFER TO THE EXACT SAME THING. THE IMPORTANT THING IS WE HAVE A  DEAL. TAXES RAISED A BIT BUT NO  SEQUESTER. WE SAVED THE LADY. BUT WE OURSELVES HAD TIED TO THE  TRACK.
THE PLAN WOULD ALSO DELAY  ACROSS-THE-BOARD SPENDING CUTS  FOR DEFENSE AND MOST FEDERAL  AGENCIES. BUT ONLY FOR TWO MONTHS. KICKING THE CAN ON TOUGH  DECISIONS TO REDUCE GOVERNMENT  SPENDING
Jon: DID I SAY SAVE? I MEANT MOVED HER A HALF MILE  FURTHER DOWN THE TRACK. SO THESE MASSIVE SPENDING CUTS  WILL COINCIDE WITH ANOTHER DEBT  CEILING BATTLE. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS  DEBACLE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON   ON?
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER  HAD KIND OF A ROUGH WEEK HERE. THE AT A PARTY FOLKS NOT HAPPY  WITH THE DEAL THAT HE STRUCK
THE PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO GET  THE SPEAKER TO UNDO EVERYTHING  HE HAD PROMISED HE WOULD DO
WHERE ARE YOU? MR. SPEAKER, WE NEED LEADERSHIP.
TONIGHT I AM ASHAMED, SHAME  ON YOU, MR. SPEAKER.
Jon: REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT,  SENATOR OR CONGRESSMAN, TEAM  EDWARD OR TEAM JACOB, EVERYONE AGREES JOHN BOEHNER SUCKS. AT LEAST WE CAN BE ASSURED THAT  AS THE INCOMING CONGRESS VOTES  FOR A NEW SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, IT'S CLEAR WHAT THE OUTCOME IS  GOING TO BE.
JOHN BOEHNER WON RE-ELECTION  AS HOUSE SPEAKER TODAY.
Jon: OH, BOY. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)  WE'LL BE RIGHT
