[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE TURN NOW TO THE GREAT CONTEST AMONG NATIONS FOR DOMINANCE IN SPACE. THE UNITED STATES ON ONE SIDE, THE SOVIET UNION ON THE OTHER. I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING, WASN'T THAT LIKE FOUR DECADES AGO? WELL, APPARENTLY NOT.
CHINA HAS BECOME JUST THE THIRD COUNTRY TO TAKE A SOFT LANDING ON THE MOON. BEIJING'S NEWEST SPACE CRAFT LANDED THERE TODAY.
Jon: TODAY! IN 2013, TODAY, IT'S LIKE THE NEW YORK CITY MARATHON YOU KNOW HOW AROUND HOUR EIGHT THERE'S ONE INSPIRATIONAL GUY IN A CAST WHO WOULDN'T GIVE UP AND HE MAKES IT ALL THE WAY AND THEN HE IS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER GUY IN A BEAR SUIT FOR SOME REASON (bleep)  NOBODY KNOWS WHY. IN THE SPACE RACE THAT BEAR IS CHINA. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT MEANS  IT'S TIME TO DUST OFF THE REOCCURRING SEGMENT SPACE RACE 1957! â™ª  SO WHAT DO WE KNOW KNOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLICS NEW MOON ROVER.
THE SOLAR POWERED ROVER WILL INSPECT THE MOON'S SURFACE FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS IN SEARCH OF VALUABLE MINERAL DEPOSITS IT'S CALLED THE JADE RABBIT. A NAME THE ENTIRE NATION VOTED ON.
OH, I'VE READ SCIENCE FICTION STORIES ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THE DAY THAT PEOPLE IN CHINA WERE ALLOWED TO VOTE. BOOM! COMMUNISTS OLIGARCHY SLAM. [LAUGHTER] IT'S IMPRESSIVE THOUGH THAT THE ENTIRE NATION OF CHINA CAME OUT TO VOTE. AMERICANS WON'T GET OFF THEIR ASSES TO VOTE FOR A PRESIDENT.
THE NAME WAS DECIDED IN A PUBLIC ONLINE POLL.
Jon: OH, ONLINE. IT'S A PRETTY GOOD NAME JADE RABBIT. IF AMERICA NAMED ITS SPACE CRAFT USING WEB POLLS THE NEXT SPACE CRAFT WOULD BE U.S.S. RON PAUL 2012 #MILEY SUCKS.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE ASTRONAUT SO CUTE A MONKEY.
Jon: SO CUTE HE DOESN'T LOOK TERRIFIED AT ALL. THAT IS A MONKEY HAVING A REALLY GOOD TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] MORE FUN THAN A BARREL OF HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] YES, IRAN SENT A MONKEY INTO SPACE AND SAFELY BACK TO EARTH WHERE HE WAS GIVEN EITHER A HERO'S WELCOME OR A JEWISH WEDDING. [LAUGHTER] IF NOTHING ELSE SOONER OR LATER IRAN WILL RUN OUT OF MONKEYS BUT CHINA YOU BETTER BACK OFF. BEING ON THE MOON IS OUR THING. WHEN WE STARTED OUT AS A YOUNG NATION WE DIDN'T GO, HEY, YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN MAKE OUR MARK? LET'S BUILD A GREAT WALL. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD LOVE TO BUILD A GREAT WALL. [LAUGHTER] SO YOU REALLY WANT TO STEP TO US, CHINA BECAUSE THE MOON WAS CHILD'S PLAY. WE'RE ALREADY HALF WAY TO MARS MOTHER (bleep). WHICH REMINDS ME, HEY, CHINA, CAN BE BORROW SOME MONEY TO FINISH OUR MARS TRIP? [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
