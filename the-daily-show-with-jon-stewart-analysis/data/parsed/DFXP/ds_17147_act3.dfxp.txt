Jon:  THIS IS A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE WHERE NBC NEWS, THE CONVERSATION ABOUT AMERICA IS NOW OUT IN THE PAPERBACK FORM. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM TOM BROCAW. [CROWD CHEERING] HOW ARE YOU, SIR.
VERY WELL, THANK YOU. ALTHOUGH I ARRIVED TODAY AND WENT THROUGH THE FIRST OF 104 SECURITY CHECK POINTS. SO I A LARGE LARGE DEPARTMENT OF PRISONS A NORTH CAROLINA LINE INMATE TRANSFER AND I THOUGHT  THAT WOULD BE ME AND THEY TRANSFERRED ME AND I AM HERE.
Jon:  YOU ARE HERE. I TELL YOU THEY HAVE LOCKED THIS CITY DOWN.
I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE.
THAT'S WHERE THE BANKERS OWN ME.
Jon:  NICELY DONE, SIR, NICELY DONE. HERE WE GO. SO HOW MANY OF THESE RODEOS HAVE YOU BEEN TO BEFORE.
THIS IS MY 24TH.
Jon:  WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST?
FIRST ONE WAS 1968 IN CHICAGO. THAT WAS A RIOT AND A CONVENTION BROKE OUT IT TURNED OUT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  SO THIS IS IN A NATION WE'VE GONE FROM DO YOU THINK THIS YEAR TAKE OUT ALL THE  GATES AND ALL THE POLICE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND WITHOUT SHIRTS ON GETTING BEAT ON.
NO, IT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CULTURE. 68, PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN VIETNAM LYNDON JOHNSON HEADED THEM BACK IN --  >>IN --
Jon:  WE'RE HEADING INTO A DOG -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN  TAKE CARE OF IT SINGLE HANDEDLY.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT CHUCK NORRIS BUT I'M WAITING TO HEAR WHAT THE BOUNTY HUNTER --
Jon:  LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DRIVING ME INSANE.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
Jon:  IT'S DRIVING ME INSANE AND I'M NOT THAT FAR TO BEGIN WITH. THIS IS FROM CNN POLL LINES.
-- FACT CHECKINGS  [INDISCERNIBLE] WILL HAVE AM OPPORTUNITY TO GO FORWARD TO ENSURE -- THERE WILL BE SOME  ISSUES, SOME OF THE FACTS BUT IT'S MOTIVATED PEOPLE.
Jon:  WHEN DID FACT CHECKING AND JOURNALISM SEPARATE? AND GO THEIR SEPARATE WAYS? IT FEELS LIKE NOW WHAT ARE THE JOURNALISTS DOING AT THE CONVENTION OTHER THAN DECIDING  WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING HELPED ONE CANDIDATE. IT'S NOT FACT CHECKING WHAT'S YOUR JOB. THEN YOU WILL JUST MC.
WHAT HAPPENED IS EVERYTHING IS SO -- THEY WERE RESPONDING VERY QUICKLY. YOU SEE THAT NIGHT WE WERE ON GOOGLE AND OTHER PLACES LOOKING AT THE RYAN, LOOKING AT THE  PAINFUL -- IT WAS ACTUALLY CLOSED. WHO VOTED FOR THE BAILOUT, PAUL RYAN DID AS WELL. BUT WHAT HAPPENS NOW JON IN THIS WORLD WHICH WE BOTH OCCUPY, I LIKE TO THINK WE'RE A LITTLE  HIGHER LEVEL OVER HERE.
Jon: -- OCCUPY REFERENCE, PAR FOR THE KIDS. [LAUGHTER]
EVERYTHING HAPPENED AT WHOPPER SPEED.
Jon:  IT DOESN'T HAVE TO. THE CONVENTION IS OVER A THREE DAY PERIOD. IT'S 24 HOUR COVERAGE. IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE MAKING IT SEEM AS THOUGH IT'S WARPED SPEED AND WE BROUGHT THE LEVEL OF  SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY SIT BACK AND TAKE THE TIME, NO.
I THINK THAT'S TRUE. I THINK PART OF THE REASON THAT WE HAVE KIND OF THE LOWER VIEWERSHIP, EVERYBODY  UNDERSTANDS THEY HAVE TO SANITIZE AND SCRUB AND BUTTON UP. THESE DELEGATES ARRIVED ON THE FLOOR FOR EXAMPLE, THEY'RE TOLD WHEN TO SIT, HOW TO STAND, WHAT  TO SAY AND HOW TO ATTACK THE OPPOSITION AND DON'T GET OUT OF LINE.
Jon:  ARE THE DELEGATES ACTUALLY COACHED OFFICIALLY.
BEFORE THEY GO OUT, THEY'RE ON THE FLOOR. THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN.
Jon:  HAS OUR EFFORT TO DISCREDIT THEIR AUTHORITY BEEN EFFECTIVE IN HAVING THEM MAKE  STATEMENTS OF FACT OR TRUTH OR BEING ABLE TO STATE THINGS MORE AUTHORITATIVELY.
I THINK THERE'S AROUND ENORMOUS EFFORT UNDER WAY ON TWITTER, ON BLOG ON MESSAGES OF  ALL KINDS. BUT -- WALKED THROUGH PAUL RYAN IN GREAT DETAIL DESCRIBED WHERE HE IN MY PHRASE OVERREACHED ON MEDICARE.
Jon:  THE PHRASE OVERREACHED IS THE NICE ES WAY TO SAY LIE. [CROWD CHEERING]
Jon:  DON'T, YOU KNOW, SO RARELY, I THOUGHT IT WAS --
ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAID HOW CAN THEY KEEP UP WITH THEM THOUSANDS OF THE NUANCES. HAD HE JUST STATED.
Jon:  THEY HAVE STATE TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE'RE NOT GOING  TO LET FACT CHECKERS RUN OUR CAMPAIGN, PROPAGANDA IS KEY. THIS IS PURPOSEFUL --
THERE'S A SHADE OF GRAY THERE, THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. LAST FRIDAY WE WENT THROUGH THIS. WE WALKED BACK THROUGH IT AGAIN, HAD A PRETTY GOOD DEBATE ABOUT IT AGAIN ON A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES. AT THE END OF THIS WEEK, AFTER WE HEAR FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA AND EVEN THOUGH CLINTON AND OTHERS, THERE WILL BE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO CHECK AND PUT IN CONTEXT OR CHECK AT SOME POINT. WE HAVE EASIER ACCESS THAN WE'VE EVER HAD BEFORE BY THE WAY -- IMMEDIATELY GO ON-LINE AND SEE  WHAT'S GOING ON.
Jon:  STICK AROUND. YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. TOM BROCAW, EVERYBODY. PLEASE PLEASE.
