FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,  WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GUEST TONIGHT, EDIE FALCO. SHE'S THE STAR OF "NURSE  JACKIE", GREAT SHOW. BUT FIRST, THE 2012 PRESIDENTIAL  CAMPAIGN WILL MOST LIKELY BE  BEST REMEMBERED FOR THE BATTLE THE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS  WAGED FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN  VOTE.
IN 2012 PRESIDENT OBAMA WON  93% OF THE BLACK VOTE.
Jon: OH, THEY WERE SO  CLOSE. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE AS  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STARTS  MINORITY VOTER OUTREACH PROGRAM. YESTERDAY KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND  PAUL FELL ASLEEP ON THE  WASHINGTON METRO'S GREEN LINE AND ENDED UP AT HISTORICALLY  BLACK HOWARD UNIVERSITY WHERE HE  DECIDED TO SPEAK.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME ARE  YOU NERVOUS ABOUT SPEAKING AT  HOWARD. SOME HAVE SAID I'M EITHER BRAVE  OR CRAZY TO BE HERE TODAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: BUT THAT'S WHAT HEROS  DO. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DON'T THINK ABOUT THE ODDS  WHEN THEY PLUNGE HEADFIRST INTO  A SYMPOSIUM WITH HIGH ACHIEVING STUDENTS AT A PRESTIGIOUS  UNIVERSITY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT GO AHEAD YOU HAD THEM AT  "YOU'RE CRAZY."
HOW ABOUT THE PARTY THAT  FIRST ELECTED THE BLACK SENATOR,  THE PARTY THAT ELECTED THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN CONGRESSMEN,  HOW DID THAT PARTY BECOME A  PARTY THAT NOW LOSES 95% OF THE BLACK VOTE.
Jon: I'LL TAKE THAT ONE. BECAUSE FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS  THEY'VE EMBRACES THE SOUTHERN  STRATEGY WHICH STATED THAT QUOTE FROM NOW ON THE REPUBLICANS ARE  NEVER GOING TO GET MORE THAN 20%  OF THE NEGRO VOTE AND THEY DON'T NEED ANYMORE THAN THAT. THEY WOULD BE SHORT SIGHTED IF  THEY WEAKENED THE VOTING RIGHTS  ACT BECAUSE THE SOONER THE NEGRO-PHONE WHITES WILL SWITCH  TO THE REPUBLICANS. THAT'S WHY THE VOTES ARE. ALL THE WAY UP TO THE PRESENT  DAY WHERE THE PARTY HAD A  SERIOUS PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER THAT LIVED ON A RANCH THAT HAD  ONCE BEEN CALLED.
NIGGER HEAD.
Jon: RIGHT, THAT. SO ALL THAT WILL TEND TO  ALIENATE A VOTING BLOCK. [ LAUGHTER ] -1-WHY DO YOU THINK THEY'VE BEEN  VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS?
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HASN'T  TALKED ENOUGH ABOUT THE GREAT  HISTORY AND INTERACTION BETWEEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND BLACK  HISTORY AND VOTING RIGHTS IN OUR  COUNTRY. THE STORY OF EMANCIPATION, OF  VOTING RIGHTS AND CITIZENSHIP TO  THE MODERN ERA IS THE HISTORY OF REPUBLICAN PARTISM WE SEE  HORRIBLE RACISM THAT HAPPENED IN  THE 30s, 40s, 50s, IT WAS ALL DEMOCRATS. IT WASN'T REPUBLICANS.
Jon: RIGHT BUT FOR THE MOST  PART THOSE BIGOTED DEMOCRATS IN  THE 30s, 40s AND 50s BECAME REPUBLICANS POST THE  MODERN CIVIL RIGHTS EVERY ARE  BECAUSE OF IT. YOU CAN'T JUST YADA YADA YADA  THE LAST 60 YEARS. A REPUBLICAN FREED THE SLAVES. GAYS, BLACK PEOPLE THE VOTE. YADA YADA AND NOW I'LL VOTE  DEMOCRATIC. WHAT THE HELL. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS THEORY  THAT ALL THAT STANDS BETWEEN THE  REPUBLICANS ANT PLURALITY OF THE BLACK SHIFT A HISTORY LESSON IS  WELL, ENJOY.
HOW MANY OF YOU -- IF I WOULD  HAVE SAID WHO DO YOU THINK THE  FOUND YOURS OF NAACP WOULD EVERYBODY KNOW THE FOUNDERS WERE  REPUBLICANS.
YES.
YOU KNOW MORE THAN I KNOW.
AND I DON'T MEAN THAT TO BE  INSULTING I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU  KNOW AND I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE CONNECTION IS.
Jon: CALM DOWN, EVERYBODY. JUST CALM DOWN. RED TEAM START THE CAR. TURNS OUT I'M NEITHER CRAZY NOR  BRAVE. THE GRAY HAIR NEEDS TO BE  PLUCKED. REMOVE THE VANILLA BEAN FROM THE  HOT CHOCOLATE. HOWARD UNIVERSITY DOESN'T JUST  EDUCATE BLACK PEOPLE. WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR BLACK  CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE. LARRY --
JON.
Jon: SENATOR RUN AND PAUL,  WHO I LIKE VERY MUCH. HE SAID HIS FRIENDS ARE CALLING  HIM BRAVE OR CRAZY FOR SPEAKING  AT HOWARD. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BRAVE. IT'S HOWARD UNIVERSITY NOT THE  APOLLO. [LAUGHTER] ALTHOUGH I DID THINK IT WAS A  NICE GESTURE FOR HIM TO GET A  JERRY CURL BEFORE COMING OVER.
Jon: THAT'S NOT A JERRY  CURL THAT'S WHAT HIS HAIR LOOKS  LIKE.
SERIOUSLY? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YEAH.
AND HE GOES UP ON STAGE? THEN HE IS BRAVE.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU THINK  ABOUT HIS -- LET'S CALL IT TIME  SHARE PRESENTATION FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
RIGHT. WELL, IT'S TEMPTING, EXPWRON. LET ME -- TEMPTING, JON. LET'S BE HONEST BLACK PEOPLE  HAVE BEEN WITH THE DEMOCRATIC  PARTY FOR 50 YEARS NOW. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A LITTLE  STRANGE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THE REPUBLICANS ARE  NOT REALLY STRANGE. YOU TAPPED THAT BEFORE.
WE TAPPED IT FOR 100 YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE PROBLEM. I KNOW ALL THEIR MOVES. WE WERE IN LOVE ONCE? YES. PEOPLE CHANGE SO DO PARTIES.
Jon: IT SOUNDS LIKE THE  REPUBLICANS WOULD LIKE TO  REKINDLE THE RELATIONSHIP BY REMINDING YOU OF THE GOOD TIMES  YOU SHARED.
RIGHT, YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU  GET BACK WITH SOMEONE. IT'S FUN FOR A WHILE UNTIL YOU  REMEMBER THIS IS EXACTLY HOW YOU  FELT BEFORE YOU CAUGHT THEM IN BED WITH THE DIXIE CRATS.
Jon: THE REPUBLICANS LEFT  BLACK AND NOW THEY WANT TO COME  BACK.
I LIKE THAT YOU TWISTED IT  AROUND. ALL RIGHT. YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW THEY ARE  PRETENDING THEY DIDN'T DO  ANYTHING. YOU CAN'T DISAPPEAR FOR 40 AND  50 YEARS AND SUDDENLY SASH YEAH  BACK TO ROSCOE'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES AND SAY, HEY, BABY PARTY  IN LINCOLN'S BED. THAT'S SO OLD BROTHERS DON'T  EVEN DRIVE LINCOLNS.
Jon: DID YOU COMPARE THAT  TO ROSCOE'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.
IT'S AN HISTORICALLY BLACK  MEAL.
Jon: TRUE.
HOW CAN WE TRUST THAT YOU'VE  CHANGED IF YOU ARE PRETENDING IT  WAS ALWAYS ALL GOOD.
Jon: I DON'T THINK THEY ARE  PRETENDING. I THINK THEY BELIEVE IT.
BUT JON THIS IS SAY  REPUBLICAN COMMISSIONER IN  KANSAS TALKING ABOUT FIXING A ROOF LAST WEEK, OKAY.
THE MISTAKE THAT COUNTY  COMMISSIONER JIM GUILE MADE  USING A RACIAL SLUR IN A PREVIOUS COUNTY COMMISSION  MEETING. HE WAS TALKING REPAIRG A ROOF  WHEN HE SAID.
I GUARANTEE IT WOULD BE THE  SAME IF YOU LET A (bleep).
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ISN'T IT?
NO, HE SAID NIGGER RIGGING. THEY WANT US BACK?
Jon: IS THAT BETTER OR  WORSE THAN REGULAR RIGGING? I'VE NOT HEARD THAT.
I'M GOING TO GUESS IT'S  WORSE. REPUBLICANS NEED TO ADMIT WE'RE  NOT DEALING WITH ACCIDENTAL  RACISM. IF THE PAST 50 YEARS WERE THE  BRAD PAISLEY, LL COOL J LET BY  GONES BE BY GONES WE'VE WE'D HAVE DONE WITH FOR THE TAX
