WELCOME BACK. THERE HAS BEEN DISSPIRITING  NEWS OF THE INTRACTABLE WAR  IN SIR YA, THE COLLAPSE OF EGYPTIAN DEMOCRACY AND THE  DECISION TO EXTEND UNDER THE  DOME FROM A MINISERIES TO A FULL-FLEDGED SERIES. THEY'RE UNDER A DOME. THEY'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF  SUPPLIES. THEY'RE UNDER A DOME. THE PREMISE IS NOT  SUSTAINABLE. THEY'RE IN A DOME. BUT AT LEAST THIS SUMMER  DOES HAVE ONE THING OVER  THIS TIME LAST YEAR. THERE IS NOT AN ELECTION  GOING ON.
THERE COULD BE THE FIRST  SHOTS FIRED IN THE BATTLE  FOR 2016.
READY FOR 2016.
THE WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN  GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE AND  SENATOR RAND PAUL.
FIRST IF STARTED ON  NATIONAL SECURITY, THEN IT  TURNED TO PORK BARREL  SPENDING.
IS THIS A PREVIEW OF  2016.
NO, MEDIA, NAUGHTY MEDIA. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DID  THIS. IF YOU DON'T PLAY WITH THE  LAST PRESIDENT WE GOT YOU,  WE'RE NOT GETTING YOU  ANOTHER ONE. NOW LET'S ALL JUST TAKE A  BREATH HERE, CHRISTIE VERSUS  PAUL SEEMS LIKE PRETTY  STANDARD ONE POLL FIGURES BICKERING WITH ANOTHER ONE. IT CAN'T BE HE RAISED-- A  RACE IF ONLY ONE PARTY  VUNNING SO LET'S ALL JUST  RELAX.
GET READY FOR ALL HILLARY,  ALL THE TIME. IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS  THE DRUMBEAT IS GETTING  LOUDER FOR A 2016  PRESIDENTIAL RUN BY THE FORMER SENATOR, SECRETARY OF  STATE AND FIRST LADY.
NO, NO, NO! NOW WE HAVE TO INTRODUCE OUR  NEW SEGMENT, CAN'T YOU AT  LEAST WAIT UNTIL JON STEWART GETS BACK? PLEASE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PLEASE, ENDLESS  PRESIDENTIAL RACES ARE  REALLY MORE HIS KIND OF  THING AND HE'S BACK IN SEPTEMBER WHEN WILL YOU  STILL HAVE OVER THREE YEARS  UNTIL THE ELECTION. THE LAST ONE OF WHICH LET ME  REMIND YOU END YOU LESS THAN  NINE MONTHS AGO. WHY THIS SUDDEN OUTBREAK OF  EARLY ONSET 2016 FEVER?
SHE HAD A BREAKFAST WITH  JOE BIDEN.
THERE SHE WAS YESTERDAY,  LUNCHING WITH THE PRESIDENT.
THEY HAD PASTA, SALAD,  GRILLED CHICKEN AND NOW A  DAY LATER, THE NEXT DAY SHE'S DEVICE PRESIDENT'S  RESIDENCE FOR SCRAMBLED  EGGS. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
YEAH, WHAT IS THAT ALL  ABOUT, JOE BIDEN? LEARN TO BE A BETTER HOST. DON'T JUST SWIRL SOME EGGS  IN A PAN. MAKE SOME WAFFLES OR A  QUICHE. GO DOWN TO THE FARMER'S  MARKET AND GET SOME FRESH  SEASONAL BARRIES FOR GOD'S  SAIX. YOU'RE ENTERTAINING THE  WOMAN SWHO GOING TO BEAT NEW  THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. BUT NO, JOHN, DON'T GET  SUCKED IN. DON'T GET SUCKED IN. BUT NOWHERE WAS THE NEWS  THAT A WOMAN ATE AN  UNPRECEDENTSED TWO MEALS,  GREETED WITH MORE UNCOMFORTABLY INTENSE  ENTHUSIASM THAN WITH CHRIS  MATTHEWS.
VERY FLATTERING PICTURE  OF HER AND THE PRESIDENT  SITTING AS EQUALS AS THE PRESIDENT SITTING WITH  ANOTHER PRESIDENT. VERY PRESIDENTIAL PICTURE  OVER IN THE ROSE GARDEN. SHE NOW IS LOOKING FABULOUS. I DON'T KNOW, I KNOW I  SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT LOOKS  WITH A WOMAN BUT I'M JUST  SAYING THE WAY SHE IS PRESENTING HERSELF, IT  ALWAYS GETS ME IN TROUBLE. I WILL SAY IT AGAIN. THE DARK SUIT, THE HAIRCUT,  EVERYTHING SAID THIS PERSON  LOOKS READY FOR PRIME TIME. SHE LOOKS PRESIDENTIAL AS  HELL. I WILL JUST PUT IT THAT WAY.
PUTTING IT THAT WAY DOES  NOT HELP IT HOW DO YOU MAKE  THE WORD PRESIDENTIAL SOUND  PERVIE? JUST A LITTLE TIP TO CHRIS  MATTHEWS, WHEN YOU SAY YOU  SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT  SOMETHING, WHY NOT NOT ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT IT? THAT WAY EVERYONE WINS. BUT LOOK, I GUESS WE HAVE NO  CHOICE. IF THE 2016 ELECTION IS  REALLY GETTING LAUNCHED,  WE'RE GOING HAVE TO COVER IT  I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING TO SAY THIS, LET'S GO RIGHT OUT  TO JESSICA WILLIAMS WHO IS  KOFERK HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN TONIGHT IN NEW  HAMPSHIRE. JESSICA, JESSICA,.
JOHN, I DO NOT WANT TO BE  HERE! NOT AT ALL.
NO ONE WANTS THIS, JESS,  THAT'S WHY IT'S JOURNALISM. BUT HOW ARE THE PEOPLE OF  NEW HAMPSHIRE REACTING?
WELL, MAINLY THEY SEEM  CONFUSED TO SEE A BLACK  PERSON UP HERE IN A  NONELECTION YEAR.
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE, JESS  KA. I'VE GOT TO ASK, HAVE YOU  BEEN ABLE TO ASK ANY VOTERS  THERE ABOUT 2016.
OH, YEAH. AND THEIR REACTIONS ARE ALL  OVER THE MAP FROM WHAT IS  YOUR PROBLEM? TO WHY CAN'T THE MEDIA JUST  LEAVE ME ALONE? I'M JUST TRYING TO LIVE MY  LIFE FOR 10 MINUTES. BUT OVERALL JOHN THERE IS A  SOLID MAJORITY GOING FOR [BLEEP] YOU.
OKAY. THOSE ARE GOOD RESULTS. THANKS, JESSICA.
THANK YOU.
YOU STAY UP THERE, ONLY  39 MONTHS TO GO.
NO OOOO!
JESSICA WILLIAMS,  EVERYONE
