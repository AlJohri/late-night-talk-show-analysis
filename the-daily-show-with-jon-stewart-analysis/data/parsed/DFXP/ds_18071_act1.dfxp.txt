FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. FORMER SUPREME COURT JUSTICE  SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR IS JOINING  US THIS EVENING SITTING RIGHT HERE DISCUSSING THE SUPREME  COURT AND HER NEW SITCOM. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU WATCH OUR PROGRAM OR ARE  ALIVE, YOU MIGHT BE AWARE THAT  THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN FACING SOME DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES  WHICH HAVE CAUSED A GREAT DEAL  OF SOUL SEARCHING ABOUT HOW WE AS A NATION CAN IDENTIFY AND  RECTIFY THE CAUSES OF OUR  FINANCIAL MELTDOWN. WE'VE BEEN WRINGING OUR HANDS  ABOUT IT BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS  IT'S ALREADY BEEN FIXED.
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AT  NEVER BEFORE SEEN HEIGHTS.
ALL TIME HIGH.
MAKING HISTORY TODAY.
IF THEY TELL YOU EVERYTHING  IS AWFUL, TELL THEM NO IT'S NOT. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JON: AMEN. IT'S A MARCH MIRACLE THE  NON-INFLATION ADJUSTED VALUES OF  STOCKS THAT 30 LARGE COMPANIES THAT SORT OF TRACKED THE  AMERICAN ECONOMY 50 YEARS AGO  ARE HIGHER THAN EVER. WE'RE BACK, BABY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE BEST PART IS WE NEVER  HAD TO FIX OUR SYSTEMIC ISSUES. [ LAUGHTER ] IT GOT BETTER. THAT BRINGS US TO OUR NEW  SEGMENT "I GUESS THAT'S ONE  PROBLEM WE NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AGAIN." [ LAUGHTER ] HERE IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PART  OF THE COMEBACK IT TOOK WALL  STREET FIVE AND A HALF YEARS TO REPAIR THE GAPING WOUND THEY  SELF INFLICTED. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S ANOTHER REASON WALL STREET  IS BETTER THAN MAIN STREET,  FASTER HEALERS. WHO KNEW THAT AMONGST WALL  STREET'S MANY CHARMS AND TALENTS  WAS THE HEALING ABILITY OF  WOLVERINE. [LAUGHTER] ALTHOUGH WE ALREADY KNEW THEY  HAD THE DAMAGING POWER OF  WOLVERINE. [ LAUGHTER ] I SURE WISH WE HEALED LIKE THAT. ANYHOW, THE POINT IS WE NO  LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT  FIXING WALL STREET, UNACCEPTABLE RISK AND VOLATILITY ISSUES. THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT HISTORY  NEVER REPEATING DOESN'T END  THERE. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE FIXED? RACISM. BAM! BA-BAM! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LIKE THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL  AVERAGE, BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS  COUNTRY ARE AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. [ LAUGHTER ] WE SHOULD HAVE A TICKER UNDER  THE SCREEN JUST TRACKING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WITH RACISM STRUCTURAL  PROBLEMS FIXED, PERHAPS IT'S  TIME TO GET RID OF THE CLEARLY OBSOLETE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF  1965.
THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT HAS  BEEN THE LAW OF THE LAND FOR  NEARLY HALF A CENTURY HELPING TO ENSURE THAT ARE NOTES ARE NOT --  MINORITIES ARE NOT DENIED THE  RIGHT TO VOTE. THE LAW REQUIRES STATES WITH A  HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION TO GET  FEDERAL APPROVAL BEFORE CHANGING HOW THEY CONDUCT ELECTIONS.
Jon: LIKE IF YOU WANT A  LOAN BUT HAVE A HISTORY OF BAD  CREDIT YOU MAY NEED EXTRA DOCUMENTATION OR GET A COSIGNER  OR IF YOU WANT TO MOVE NEAR A  SCHOOL AND YOU ARE A SEX OFFENDER, YOU HAVE TO THRAWN BY  SOMEONE. [LAUGHTER] SHELBY COUNTY, ALABAMA S LEADING  THE CHARGE TO STRIKE WHAT THEY  CONSIDER TO BE AN UNFAIR PROVISION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS  ACT. THEY ARE HOPING TO BECOME THE  JACKIE ROBINSON'S OF PEOPLE WHO  HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED PEOPLE LIKE JACKIE ROBINSON.
TODAY SHELBY COUNTY ALABAMA  CHALLENGED THE LAW AT THE  SUPREME COURT.
THE AMERICA THAT ELECTED  BARACK OBAMA IS NOT THE AMERICA  OF OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS.
Jon: IT'S A COMPLETELY  DIFFERENT AMERICA. WE HAVE CELL PHONES NOW AND  THINGS COST MORE THAN A NICKLE. COCA-COLA NO LONGER HAS COCAINE  IN IT ALTHOUGH -- YOU HAVE TO  BUY IT SEPARATELY. AND IN SOME COMMUNITIES YOU HAVE  TO BE CAREFUL YOU ARE NOT  ALLOWED TO HAVE 16 OUNCES OF  OTHER. [ LAUGHTER ] SHELBY -- PEOPLE, YOU KNOW WHAT  YOU ARE? SODA ADDICTS. [ LAUGHTER ] SHELBY COUNTY AL ALABAMA IS THAT  SINCE AMERICA ELECTED A BLACK  MAN IPSO FACTO WE'RE FREE NOW OF  RACISM. ALTHOUGH I GUESS COROLLARY WOULD  BE BY THEIR OWN REASONING IF YOU  DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM E OH, YEAH,  OKAY. [LAUGHTER] THE POINT IS SHELBY COUNTY  ALABAMA SEES THE VOTING RIGHTS  ACT LESS AS AN EFFECTIVE BULL WORTH LESS EFFECTIVE AND  MORE LIKE ORTHODONTA, NICE BUT  NO LONGER NEEDED IN NEEDED IN THE SOUTH. MEANING IT'S STRAIGHTENED OUT  THE PROBLEM AND YOU CAN REMOVE  IT BECAUSE IT'S STRAIGHTENED. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME ANY STATE  ON THE LIST OF PREVIOUSLY  DISCRIMINATING STATES TRIED TO COOK UP VOTING SHENANIGANS BUT  WERE STOPPED.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS  REJECTED I.D. LAWS IN TEXAS AND  SOUTH CAROLINA.
Jon: YEAH BUT THAT WAS LAST  YEAR. IT WAS LIKE SIX TAYLOR SWIFT  BREAKUP SONGS AGO. [LAUGHTER] THE POINT ISN'T THAT THE VOTING  RIGHTS ACT IS STOPPING  DISCRIMINATION BEFORE IT HAPPENS, IT'S WHY CAN'T WE GO  BACK TO THE OLD MODEL OF  DISCRIMINATING FIRST AND STOPPING IT LATER? [LAUGHTER] AS DIVISIVE AS THIS ISSUE IS  IMAGINE THE RENEWAL OF THE  VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS IN THE  SENATE.
THE SENATE VOTED TO TO RENEW  THE LANDMARK VOTING RIGHTS ACT. THE VOTE WAS 98-0.
Jon: IS THAT EVEN ALLOWED  IN THE SENATE ANYMORE? YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET A  UNANIMOUS VOTE IN THE SENATE? THEY COULDN'T PASS ICE CREAM  APPRECIATION DAY BECAUSE SENATOR  CRAPO IS LACTOSE INTOLL RENT AND SENATOR INHOFE READ IT MAKES YOU  GAME IT'S BEN AND MARY NOT BEN  AND JERRY. ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE LAW THAT SHELBY  COUNTY HAS A PROBLEM WITH, THE  EFFECTIVE POPULAR ONE. THE ONE BOTH ITS SENATORS  ALABAMA VOTED TO RENEW. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO SELL  THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. TO THE SUPREMES!
GO TO THE COUNTY WHOSE RECORD  IS THE EPITOME OF WHAT CAUSED  THE PASSAGE OF THIS LAW TO START  WITH. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: PERHAPS -- NO, NO,  WAIT, I THINK I HAVE A REASON,  THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE. [ LAUGHTER ] (bleep). [LAUGHTER] JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR APPEARS TO BE  UPHOLDING THE STATUTE.
IS IT THE GOVERNMENT'S  POSITION THAT CITIZENS IN THE  SOUTH ARE MORE RACIST THAN CITIZENS IN THE NORTH.
Jon: NO, WE'VE BEEN TO  BOSTON. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, YEAH. AND MY GRANDPARENTS HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD PUT PERSONAL NORTHERN  RACISM UP AGAINST ANYBODY'S  RACISM. IT'S NOT ABOUT PERSONAL  PREJUDICE IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMIC  DISCRIMINATION AND IF THE LAST ELECTION IS ANYTHING TO GO BY IT  SHOULD BE EXPANDING NOT  CONTRACTING.
PENNSYLVANIA LAWMAKERS PASSED  A VOTER I.D. LAW IN MARCH.
WISCONSIN PUT IN PHOTO I.D. LAWS WHICH CRITICS SAY MAKE IT  HARDER FOR MINORITIES AND THE  POOR TO VOTE.
NEW VOTING RESTRICTIONS IN  OHIO.
THE REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF  STATE WANTED TO CLOSE EARLY  VOTING IN THE WEEKEND LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION.
OHIO REPUBLICANS FAILED IN  THEIR ATTEMPT TO EXPAND VOTING  HOURS IN REPUBLICAN AREAS THAN CUTTING THEM BACK IN DEMOCRATIC  AREAS.
Jon: WHAT MORE DOES OHIO  HAVE TO DO TO GET ON THE LIST OF  STATES? REPLACE VOTING MACHINES WITH  SHREDDERS. SO FAR IT'S BEEN AN INTELLIGENT  RESPECTFUL MANNER. MAYBE DESCRIBING WHY THEY THINK  THE SENATE RENEWED IT  UNANIMOUSLY. SCALIA. GIVE IT A GO.
IT'S BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT WHEN  A SOCIETY ADOPTS RACIAL  ENTITLEMENTS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THEM OUT THROUGH THE  NORMAL POLITICAL CONGRESS. IT'S NOT THE KIND OF QUESTION  YOU LEAVE TO CONGRESS. THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE VOTES IF  THEY DO NOT ENREENACT THE VOTING  RIGHTS ACT. THE NAME IS WONDERFUL.
Jon: CONGRESS IS TOO  FRIGHTENED TO CHALLENGE IT BASED  ON AT PEEL OF ITS NAME. I'M ASSUMING HE WOULD STRIKE  DOWN THE SIGNERS OF DECORATION  OF INDEPENDENCE UNDER THE SAME  LOGIC. I BELIEVE IF JOHN HANCOCK SIGNED  THE I WISH OUR TEA WAS CHEAPER. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST BE  LIKE TO WORK WITH THAT GUY? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH
