WOOO. NICELY DONE.
Jon: WHAT IS UP, MAN?
YEAH, MAN.
Jon: IT'S NICE TO SIGH, MY  FRIEND. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M WELL.
Jon: "THE DUDE AND THE ZEN  MASTER."  I ONLY EXPECT YOU TO SAY WELL  BECAUSE I IMAGINE YOU ARE ONE OF FEW PEOPLE WHO CAN WILL YOURSELF  TO WELL.
WELL, ON A GOOD DAY. ON A GOOD DAY, YES.
Jon: WHAT IS -- "THE DUDE  AND THE ZEN MASTER" I ASSUMED  YOU WERE THE ZEN MASTER. WHO IS THIS OTHER GUY.
BERNIE GLASSMAN WHO IS THE  REAL THING. HE IS THE ZEN MASTER.
Jon: BERNIE GLASSMAN.
HE'S ONE OF YOU GUYS, YEAH.
Jon: ZEN MASTER.
TOP OF THE LINE. TOP OF THE LINE.
Jon: WHAT IS -- FOR SOMEONE  WHO INTRODUCES A MOMENT ZEN  EVERY DAY, I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT.
HA, HA. THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: HOW DO YOU BECOME A  MASTER. IS IT A PHILOSOPHY, A RELIGION,  A WAY OF LIFE.
TO BE A MASTER, YOU'VE GOT TO  STUDY WITH A MASTER AND THEN HE  SAYS, TAG, YOU'RE IT.
Jon: IT'S REALLY NOT AN  ACCREDITITIED SITUATION. HOW DO YOU KNOW HE'S A MASTER. DOES HE SAY I'M THE ZEN MASTER  AND YOU'RE LIKE, ALL RIGHT.
HE'S GOT. I'LL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW.
Jon: OKAY.
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU A ZEN  MASTER NOW AND PERHAPS YOU CAN  DO THIS ON YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
Jon: I'D LIKE THAT.
OKAY.
Jon: AM I GOING TO HAVE TO  WALK ACROSS COALS OR ANYTHING? OR AM I COOL?
IT'S VERY SIMPLE. ARE YOU READY? STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE. HUA! BOOM MAN.
Jon: THAT'S IT?
NOW YOU ARE DONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, WE CAN CONTINUE ALTHOUGH  MINE HAS A BROWNISH TINT TO IT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN A BROWNNOSE. I DON'T KNOW I'M BROWN NOSING. WE CAN CONTINUE THE INTERVIEW.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. SO THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.
TO SEE IF --
Jon: I'M A ZEN MASTER I'M  PATCH ADAMS. WHAT DID YOU -- [ LAUGHTER ]
BERNIE IS ALSO A CLOWN.
Jon: HE IS A CLUN?
HE IS A CLOWN, A ZEN MASTER.
Jon: SOUNDS LOST TO ME.
NO, MAN. NO.
Jon: HE'S FOUND?
HE'S FOUND.
Jon: WHERE DO YOU MEET HIM?
AS A DINNER WITH RAHM DAWES,  THE GUY WHO WROTE "BE HERE NOW."
Jon: COME ON, HE IS ON THE  GIANTS? I DON'T FOLLOW SPIRITUALITY. HE'S A GOOD MAN, THOUGH?
A VERY GOOD MAN.
Jon: WHAT DOES HE HELP YOU  WITH? WHAT IS THE PROJECT YOU ARE ON  TOGETHER? IS A JOURNEY OF SELF  EXPLORATION?
BERNIE WAS -- I MET HIM AT  THIS THING. I DUG THE GUY. WE STARTED TO HANG OUT. HE SAYS TO ME, BY THE WAY, DO  YOU REALIZE THAT IN BUDDHA  CIRCLES THE DUDE IS CONSIDERED A ZEN MASTER. I SAID WHAT THE (bleep) ARE  YOU TALKING ABOUT? [ LAUGHTER ] HE SAID, OH, YEAH. HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, JUST TAKE  IT -- ONE THING WHO DIRECTED THE  MOVIE? THE COEN BROTHERS. HE PROCEEDS TO TELL ME ALL THE  DIFFERENT.
Jon: THAT'S A WEAK CHI TO  GOOD ON.
IT GOT ME. I SAID GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE. HE SAID LIKE, WELL, (bleep)  COMES TO LIGHT. A LINE FROM LEBOWSKI OR SHUT THE  (bleep) UP. COEN. READ THE BOOK, MAN!
Jon: ANY GUY IN ANY MOVIE  EVER IS THE ZEN MASTER. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN GOOD FELLAS. GO HOME AND GET YOUR (bleep)  SHINEBOX. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS IT GIVING YOU? DO YOU PRACTICE IT? IS IT AN ART FORM?
WITH ZEN, YOU MEAN?
Jon: HAS IT GIVEN YOU A  SENSE OF PEACE OR UNDERSTANDING?
IT'S INTERCONNECTEDNESS. REALIZING WE'RE ALL UNTIL THIS  TOGETHER. THAT -- [ LAUGHTER ] WE ARE ONE. WE ARE ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: IT MUST BE A BALL TO  HANG OUT WITH YOU GUYS. YOU HUNG OUT AND HAD THIS LONG  CONVERSATION ABOUT LIFE AND  UNDERSTANDING.
WHATEVER CAME , YOU KNOW.
Jon: AND PUT IT TOGETHER.
AND BOOM!
Jon: IF. I AM TO READ THIS, WHEN I GET TO  THE END OF JOURNEY OF THE BOOK  WHAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THEN? WHAT IS THE ENLIGHTENMENT THAT I  FIND?
THAT'S UP TO YOU, JON. $ [LAUGHTER] $.
Jon: YOU ARE A ZEN MASTER. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH.
Jon: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT  YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY. YOU'VE DONE IT.
I FORGOT THE NOSE.
Jon: I WAS REALLY WORRIED  THAT IT WAS FILLED WITH -- I WAS  GOING TO DO THIS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT. IT WASN'T SO FUNNY FOR FUNNYMAN  JON STEWART. I'M DELIGHTED -- I HAVE TO TELL  YOU -- THERE'S NOTHING MORE THAN  I THINK WOULD BE INTERESTING AND FUN THAN TO SPEND A WEEKEND  (bleep) WITH JEFF BRIDGES AND  HAVE SOMEBODY TRANSCRIBE IT INTO A BOOK. I THINK THAT WOULD BE AWESOME  "THE DUDE AND THE ZEN MASTER" IS  ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. MR. JEFF BRIDGES.
