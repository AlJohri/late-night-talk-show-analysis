(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WELCOME BACK. AS ANYBODY'S COMMUTE  INVOLVING EVEN A PASSING  THOUGHT OF THE EAST SIDE OF  MANHATTAN KNOWS THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IS IN TOWN. I GOT TO CONFESS, I LOVE IT. BECAUSE THE U.N. IS WHERE  YOU GET TO SEE COUNTRIES GO  INSANE. WHETHER IT'S KHRUSHCHEV  ATTACK ININDIVIDUALABLE  TABLE GNOMES WITH HIS FIST  OR QADDAFI DRESSED LIKE TYNE DALY THROWING THE CHARTER  AROUND OR HUGO CHAVEZ  COMPLAINING ABOUT THE ROOM'S  AIR QUALITY.
TODAY THE DEVIL CAME HERE,  RIGHT HERE.
RIGHT HERE. AND IT SMELLS OF SULFUR  STILL TODAY.
Jon: SMELLS OF SULFUR  PRETTY BOLD MOVE OF THEN  PRESIDENT BUSH SPECIFICALLY  SINCE THE CHARTER SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT HE  WHO SMELLT IT--   (LAUGHTER)  SHALL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE  DEALT IT. ANYWAY, GIVEN THAT HISTORY,  THE CURRENT STATE OF THE  WORLD, EVERYONE WAS  EXPECTING SOME HIGH DRAMA  DURING THIS WEEK'S SESSION.
AND NOW TO THAT SHOWDOWN  OVER IRAN.
ALL EYES ARE ON THE  UNITED NATION.
FIERY RHETORIC FROM THE  IRANIAN PRESIDENT.
NEXT UP OF COURSE THE  SHOWDOWN OVER IRAN. WE'LL SEE IT ALL PLAY OUT AT  THE UNITED NATIONS.
Jon: IT'S ON, WORLD WAR  III, PRESIDENT OBAMA OPENED  SO HE HAD A CHANCE TO DRAW  FIRST BLOOD.
THE IRAN YEN GOVERNMENT  CONTINUES TO PROP UP A  DICTATOR IN DAMASCUS AND  SUPPORTS TERRORIST GROUP AS  BROAD. TIME AND AGAIN IT HAS FAILED  TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO  DEMONSTRATES THAT NUCLEAR  PROGRAM IS PEACEFUL.
Jon: OH YEAH. HERE IT COME, PEOPLE,  PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GOING TO  BE LIKE, SO IT IS 0800,  BOMBING STARTS IN AN HOUR, WHO HERE WANTS TO BE IN A  COALITION OF THE WINNING  BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO [BLEEP] DEMOCRACY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO LET ME BE CLEAR,  AMERICA WANTS TO RESOLVE  THIS ISSUE THROUGH DIPLOMACY.
Jon: DIPLOMACY? YOU'RE JOHNNIE JONES A LOT. DR. SEAL TEAM 6. THE GUY WHO MADE SURE  THERE'S NO I IN BIN LADEN. (LAUGHTER)  AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE UP THERE  PRACTICALLY QUOTING GANDHI.
IT'S TIME TO HEED THE  WORDS IN GANDHI, INTOLERANCE  IS ITSELF A FORM OF VIOLENCE  AND AN OBSTACLE TO THE GROWTH OF A TRUE DEMOCRATIC  SPIRIT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, SURE,  GANDHI SAID THAT BUT I WOULD  HAVE GONE WITH ANOTHER  GANDHI QUOTE F I MAY, I CAME HERE TOO FAST OR KIBLING  ASS. -- AND I'M ALL OUT OF NO  FOOD. WHAT? TELL ME GANDHI WASN'T CRANKY  FROM THE HUNGER. I FASTED FOR ONE DAY  YESTERDAY AND I WAS READY TO  PUNCH A BABY. SO OBAMA LET ME DOWN A  LITTLE BIT. BUT YOU KNOW WHO NEVER  DISAPPOINTS, A AHMADINEJAD  WHAT A GUY, RIGHT, CAN'T  LIVE WITH HIM, CAN'T GET HIM TO ADMIT THE HOLOCAUST  REALLY HAPPENED. ALL RIGHT, I DON'T WANT TO  SAY THE GUY HAS BEEN TANKERS  WITH NUCLEAR BOMBS BUT  BEFORE HE WALKED INTO THE U.N. THAT MARBLE BEHIND HIM  WAS WHITE. DUDE'S RADIOACTIVE. LET'S TAKE A LISTEN.
I AM HERE TO VOICE THE  DEVINE AND HUMANITARIAN  MESSAGE OF LEARNED MEN AND  WOMEN OF MY COUNTRY. A MESSAGE THAT IRAN'S GREAT  OR THER AND POET SAADIN  PRESENTED TO HUMANITY IN HIS  ETERNAL TWO-LINE POETRY.
Jon: OH, I REMEMBER THAT  POEM. IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AL HICKORY AL DICK ORY DOCK,  THE ZIONISTS CAN EAT --
GIVE ME SOME THAT OLD  TIME I HATE YOUR RELIGION.
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT  MUSLIMS, CHRISTIANS, JEWS,  HINDU, BUDDHISTS AND OTHERS  HAVE ANY PROBLEM AMONG  THEMSELVES. OR ARE HOSTILE AGAINST EACH  OTHER. THEY GET ALONG TOGETHER  COMFORTABLY.
Jon: AH, IF BY  COMFORTABLY YOU MEAN WITH  NEARLY CONSTANT BLOODSHED. I MEAN IF YOU ARE NOT GOING  TO TAKE A SHOT AT THE JEWISH  GLOBAL CABAL RUINING YOUR  LIFE, AT LEAST THROW AN INSULT THE AMERICANS WAY,  YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.
ARE WE TO BELIEVE THAT  THOSE WHO SPENT  MONEY-- HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS  OF COLORS ON ELECTION  CAMPAIGNS HAVE THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD  AT THEIR HEART?
Jon: REALLY, YOU ARE  GOING TO GO AFTER US WITH  CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM? I SAY TO YOU, THE WORLD BODY,  IF McCAIN-FEINGOLD WAS NOT  SO TOOTHLESS, THE PREVALENCE  OF SUPER PACS-- ISN'T ANYBODY GOING TO GIVE US THE  RED MEAT RHETORIC AND  INNOVATIVE PROP COMEDY WE  HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM THE UNITED NATIONS?
THIS IS A BOMB--   (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M  TALKING ABOUT.
THIS IS A FUSE. IN THE CASE OF IRAN'S  NUCLEAR PLANS TO BUILD A  BOMB, A RED LINE SHOULD BE  DRAWN RIGHT HERE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,  I JUST GOT TO SAY, BEBE,  BUBBI, WHAT'S WITH THE WILEY  COYOTE NUCLEAR BOMB? ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO  PRETEND, ARE YOU GOING TO  PRETEND THAT YOU DON'T KNOW  WHAT A NUCLEAR BOMB LOOKS  LIKE? YOU'RE ISRAEL. RUN DOWNSTAIRS AND LOOK IN  THE BATESMENT. ALTHOUGH IF THAT IS THE SORT  OF BOMB WE'RE DEALING WITH I  THINK I'VE GOT A PRETTY EASY  SOLUTION TO THIS ENTIRE IRAN  PROBLEM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
