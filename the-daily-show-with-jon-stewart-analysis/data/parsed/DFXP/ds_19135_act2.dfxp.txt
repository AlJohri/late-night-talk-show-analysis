Jon: WELCOME BACK. PERIOD. HERE IS SOMETHING I DO NOT GET TO SAY VERY MUCH AT ALL LATELY: GOOD NEWS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST.
A 12-HOUR HUMANITARIAN CEASEFIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS.
THERE WERE NO CIVILIANS BEING SHELLED. THERE WERE NO ROCKETS IN THE SKIES OF TEL AVIV.
Jon: FINALLY A CEASEFIRE THAT, OKAY, 12 HOURS. ONLY SCHEDULED TO LAST AS LONG AS DECENT DOSE OF SUDAFED, BUT STILL. [LAUGHTER] IT IS SOME RELIEF. WE CAN BUILD ON THIS.
SUNDAY IT TOOK ALL OF TEN MINUTES AFTER THE FRAGILE CEASEFIRE EXPIRED AT 8:00 A.M. FOR HAMAS TO SEND ROCKETS INTO ISRAEL.
Jon: [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER] I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION IS: WHAT WAS GOING ON DURING THOSE TEN MINUTES? HELLO. PEOPLE, HUMANITARIAN CEASEFIRE ENDED TEN MINUTES AGO. TICKTOCK. THE NEVER-ENDING HATRED IN THIS REGION ISN'T GOING TO BOMB ITSELF. [LAUGHTER] THINGS ARE SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A HIGHER AUTHORITY TO INTERVENE.
EARLY THIS MORNING THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL CONVENING AN EMERGENCY MEETING.
AN EMERGENCY MIDNIGHT MEETING.
Jon: STAND BACK, BITCHES. THE U.N. IS IN TOWN. YOU MESS WITH THE BAN KI, YOU GET THE MOON. AND THIS ISN'T SOME PANSY ASS U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY MEETING. THIS IS THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL EMERGENCY MEETING, THE BIG DOGS, THE POWER PLAYERS, THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF DIPLOMACY. THAT INCLUDES CHINA, RUSSIA, FRANCE, THE U.K., THE UNITED STATES, THE COUNTRIES THAT PROBABLY GAVE THE WEAPONS IN THE FIRST PLACE. [LAUGHTER] BUT STILL, THROWING DOWN AN EMERGENCY MIDNIGHT MEETING, [BLEEPED] IS ABOUT TO GET REAL PEACEFUL.
THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CALLED FOR AN IMMEDIATE, UNCONDITIONAL CEASEFIRE.
Jon: BOOM! UNCONDITIONAL. NOT THAT SUCH RESOLUTIONS ARE IN ANY WAY ENFORCABLE OR MEANINGFUL, BUT STILL, WHEN A RESOLUTION IS ISSUED...
THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL TOOK ACTION WITH A STATEMENT, NOT A RESOLUTION.
Jon: EVEN A RESOLUTION WAS TOO MUCH? GUYS, I DON'T KNOW, A RESOLUTION SEEMS PRETTY STERN, PRETTY STERN, GUYS. EVEN A STATEMENT, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T... WHAT'S THE DEATH TOLL, 1,000 AND GROWING? WHAT ABOUT WE JUST JUMP IN WITH AN... [LAUGHTER] HEY, GUYS, YOU KNOW, IF THAT GETS PUSHBACK, WE CAN TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH. I MEAN, WE'RE ONLY A COLLECTION OF THE WORLD'S SUPERPOWERS. TURNS OUT THE SECURITY COUNCIL IS ABOUT AS STRICT WITH THE MIDEAST AS MUSEUMS ARE WITH THEIR ADMISSION PRICE. ANYBODY ELSE, ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO TAKE A CRACK AT THIS?
DURING HIS WEEKLY ADDRESS, POPE FRANCIS HIS VOICE CRACKING SAID, "I ASK YOU WITH ALL MY HEART, STOP, PLEASE."
Jon: YOUR HOLINESS, I COULD NOT AGREE MORE, BUT I HAVE TO SAY, SHERIFF, NOT SURE THIS PARTICULAR FIGHT IS YOUR JURISDICTION, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO LISTEN. SORT OF LIKE WHEN, NO... [LAUGHTER] SORT OF LIKE WHEN THE DUKE BOYS GET OVER THE COUNTY LINE, SORRY, ROSCO, IT'S THEIR PROBLEM NOW. SO THE U.N. AND THE POPE CANNOT DO ANYTHING BUT SHAKE THEIR HEADS AT THIS SITUATION AND SIGH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT HAS THE GRAVITY, THE AUTHORITY, THE INTERNATIONAL GOODWILL TO STEP INTO THE RING?
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY HEADING BACK TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO TRY AGAIN FOR A CEASEFIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS.
Jon: ANYONE? ANYONE ELSE? ANYONE? IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO [BLEEPED]? [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.
ISRAEL'S SECURITY CABINET HAS UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY'S PROPOSAL.
Jon: WOW. UNANIMOUSLY. JEWS DON'T USUALLY AGREE 100% ON ANYTHING. THAT'S... THIS IS A GOOD MARBLE RYE. IT'S DRY! ACTUALLY, THE BEST COMMENT ABOUT THIS CEASEFIRE STIPULATION FROM KERRY FOR MY MONEY CAME FROM A VERY SENIOR ISRAELI GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, WHO DESCRIBED KERRY'S CEASEFIRE PROPOSAL AS "A STRATEGIC TERRORIST ATTACK." [AUDIENCE REACTS] WHAT THE [BLEEPED]? ALL RIGHT. THAT STINGS A BIT. A SHORT-TERM CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT THAT INCLUDES STIPULATIONS ISRAEL DISAGREES WITH IS A STRATEGIC TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST YOU? YOU, JOHN KERRY, HAVE HIT US WITH A STRATEGIC TERRORIST ATTACK, AND ALSO THE IRON DOME SYSTEM YOUR COUNTRY HELPS US DEVELOP AND FUND. WE COULD USE ANOTHER $300 MILLION OR MORE TO TOP IT ALL. WE'VE BEEN USING IT A LOT LATELY. I MEAN, COME ON! AT LEAST KERRY'S KEEPING HIS CHIN UP.
IT'S NEVER EASY, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU STOP, THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU TURN AWAY. YOU HAVE TO KEEP DOING IT. REMEMBER WHAT NELSON MANDELA SAID: IT ALWAYS SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL IT IS DONE.
Jon: SO I WILL JUST PUT YOU DOWN FOR "SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE." [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
