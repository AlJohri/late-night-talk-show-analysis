[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER HER LATEST FILM ON THE SHORT LIST FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATION IS CALLED "THE SQUARE."
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME JEHANE NOUJAIM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS. IT IS THE -- THE FOOTAGE, THE STORIES ARE INCREDIBLE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THEY ARE GRIPPING. THE IDEA AS YOU EVEN SAW JUST IN THAT CLIP, RIFLES BEING POINTED --
IT WAS INTENSE.
Jon: AND YOU ARE FILMING.
A NUMBER OF US. THE WHOLE CREW MET IN THE SQUARE AND SO THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE FILMING.
Jon: HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT?
I WENT DOWN AS A PROTESTER JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DID, MET MY ENTIRE CREW IN THE SQUARE, MET THE CHARACTERS IN THE SQUARE. WE WERE SLEEPING NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN TENTS.
Jon: THIS IS THE ORIGINAL UPRISING AGAINST MUBARAK, NOT THE MOST RECENT ONE.
THIS WAS STARTING IN JANUARY 2011. I LANDED IN EGYPT, GOTTEN ARRESTED 20 MINUTES AFTER LANDING AT THE AIRPORT BECAUSE THEY FOUND AN OLD FILM I DID CALLED "EGYPT WE'RE WATCHING IT." NOT THE BEST FILM TO BE FOUND BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.
Jon: DO YOU TRAVEL WITH ALL YOUR FILMS IN THE BAG?
I WAS HANDING OUT THE DVDS TO PEOPLE IN THE MOVIE. THAT'S WHY IT WAS IN THE BAG. THEY LET ME GO AFTER EIGHT HOURS. AFTER I TRIED TO GET RID OF IT. THEY FOUND IT IN THE DRAIN. THEY HELD UP THE CHARD OF GLASS AS EVIDENCE. I CONFESSED ALL. THEY FINALLY LET ME GO AND WENT TO THE SQUARE. IT WAS MAGICAL, MEN, WOMEN, ALL DIFFERENT CLASSES, MOST OF THEM CHRISTIANS BASICALLY FIGHTING FOR A DIFFERENT COUNTRY.
Jon: IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE IN THE EARLY DAYS, TOO, MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND SECULARISTS AND SO CALLED LIBERALS, SO CALLED CONSERVATIVES, PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT POLITICAL PERSUASIONS FORMING A VERY COMMON BOND AND ETHOS.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. WE GREW UP IN AN EGYPT WHERE UNDER EMERGENCY LAW YOU CAN'T HAVE MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE PEOPLE MEETING AND TALKING ABOUT POLITICS. IT WAS UNHEARD OF. AN INCREDIBLE FEELING.
Jon: THIS WAS FOR 30 YEARS PEOPLE LIVED UNDER THIS REGIME OF MUBARAK.
EXACTLY.
Jon: YOU MAKE THE FILM, IT GOES TO SUNDANCE AND IT IS AN ENORMOUS HIT. THIS WAS WHEN?
THAT WAS JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, YEAH. 2013.
Jon: SO YOUR FILM IS A HIT.
WON THE AUDIENCE AWARD. THE PEOPLE SPOKE.
Jon: THE PEOPLE SPOKE AND YOU REALIZE LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER REVOLUTION THERE. WHAT DO YOU DO?
WE WENT BACK. IT HAPPENED AS WE WERE ON THE WAY TO SUNDANCE. PEOPLE WERE THERE SAYING MORSI IS USING THE TOOLS OF DEMOCRACY TO CREATE ANOTHER DICTATORSHIP. WE COULDN'T END THE STORY THERE BECAUSE IT WAS CONTINUING. AS IT CONTINUES TODAY. PEOPLE ARE STILL ON THE STREETS FIGHTING. PEOPLE HAVE JUST BEEN THROWN IN JAIL AGAIN. WE BASICALLY GO BACK. CONTINUE FILMING, REEDIT THE FILM AND OPEN IT IN TORONTO.
Jon: THE CRAZY THING NOW THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE COME TOGETHER, NOW THE DIVISIONS BEGIN TO CLEAVE AGAIN AND YOU WATCH THAT GO DOWN. IT'S HEARTBREAKING.
IT IS. I MEAN I THINK -- WELL, YOU HAVE TO SEE THE FILM BUT I THINK THAT THE FILM --
Jon: WE DON'T HAVE TO. WE LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY. BUT I WOULD SAY THIS, YOU SHOULD CHOOSE TO. [ LAUGHTER ] QUITE AMAZING. CONTINUE. [ LAUGHTER ]
IN ORDER TO KNOW THE ENDING OF THE FILM YOU HAVE TO SEE THE FILM. IN GENERAL WITHOUT SPOILING THE ENDING IT'S A POSITIVE LOOK BECAUSE IT LOOKS AT THE FRIENDSHIPS THAT STAY TOGETHER DESPITE THE POLITICAL DIVIDE.
Jon: YES.
WE COVER FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT ANGLES, WHAT IT FEELS TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF REVOLUTION. YOU SEE THE HEADLINES IN THE NEWS, MILLION MAN MARCH, OR THE BLOODIEST BATTLE, YOU NEVER SEE THE MARTIN LUTHER KING OR THE GANDHI WHEN THEY'VE LOST EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY LEFT THEM AND THEY ARE ALONE AND LONELY. YOU WATCH CHANGE HAPPEN.
Jon: HOW GREATNESS EMERGES FROM THIS CHAOS. PEOPLE FILL THE MOMENT WITH COURAGE, WITH INSPIRATION. IT'S AMAZING TO WATCH ORDINARY PEOPLE TAKE ON THAT MANTLE.
THANK YOU. WE'VE HAD SOME INCREDIBLE HEROES POP UP DURING THIS REVOLUTION. ONE OF THEM BASSEM YOUSSEF WHO YOU SUPPORTED. I THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF ALL EGYPTIANS.
Jon: IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO. I SUPPORT THEM FROM HERE. REALLY. [LAUGHTER] IT'S QUITE LUXURIOUS.
RIGHT NOW IT'S HORRIBLE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SHOWING THE FILM EVERYWHERE, ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE STATES. I TALKED TO THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THE FILM AND SAID I'M SORRY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHOW IT IN EGYPT YET. WE'RE WAITING FOR PERMISSION TO RELEASE IT IN EGYPT.
Jon: HERE IS WHAT WE'LL DO. CAN YOU STICK AROUND?
I CAN STICK AROUND.
Jon: WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT, ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EGYPT AND WHY YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE SHOWING IT THERE. THE SQUARE IS AVAILABLE ON NETFLIX AND IN SELECT CITIES ON JANUARY 17.
