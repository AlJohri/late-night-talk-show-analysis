SEPTEMBER 24, 2013 FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. COMING UPTON TODAY'S SHOW -- COMING UP ON TODAY'S SHOW RICHARD DAWKINS WILL BE JOINING US. AND I WILL BE ASKING HIMING QUESTIONS FROM LIBERAL PRESBERTYRIAN PASTORS. I HAVE ONE REGRET ABOUT THE EMMYS. I HAVE ONE REGRET ABOUT THE EMMYS ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND THAT IS THAT I WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND AND SHARE IN THE JOY FOR MY FRIEND STEPHEN COLBERT AND THOSE AT THE "THE COLBERT REPORT" WHO WON A WELL DESERVED  LONG OVERDUE EMMY. I HAVE BEEN IN AWE OF THAT SHOW FROM EPISODE ONE. I BELIEVE STEPHEN AND EVERYONE THERE HAS CREATED SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN SEEN ON TELEVISION AND THINGS HAPPEN ON THAT SHOW THAT COULD ONLY HAPPEN ON THAT SHOW AND THEY ARE REMARKABLE. TO MY STAFF AND CREW, HERE IS THE BEST THING ABOUT MY STAFF AND CREW IT'S NOT ABOUT -- WIN OR LOSE, IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU KNOW I SAW NEWHART ON STAGE, IF ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE A HOUSE MADE OUT OF EMMYS IT'S BOB NEWHART. HE WAS GETTING HIS FIRST AT AGE 135. [ LAUGHTER ] SO EVERYONE HERE, NEVER FORGETS HOW FORTUNATE THEY ARE TO HAVE HAD THE KIND OF RUN THAT WE'VE HAD, TO HAVE HAD THE KIND OF RECOGNITION THAT WE HAVE. WE KNOW THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY IS A PHENOMENAL ONE AND THAT IS WHAT I LOVE BEST ABOUT THIS PLACE. THERE'S NOT A PERSON IN THIS BUILDING THAT TAKES THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR GRANTED. HELL OR HIGH WATER, WINNING OR NOT WINNING. HAVING TO WATCH ANOTHER (bleep) 24 HOUR CABLE NEWS CLIP OR NOT, THEY COME IN HERE AND WE MAY NOT ALWAYS HIT THE MARK BUT THEY GIVE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE EVERY DAY AND I TRULY APPRECIATE THAT ABOUT THIS PLACE. BAR NONE. I'M REALLY PROUD. I'M PROUD TO WORK WITH THESE FOLKS. IT'S BEEN THE HONOR OF MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE SO LET'S GET TO BUSINESS. AS YOU KNOW, NEXT TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, YES, ROCKTOBER OR I GUESS IN THIS COUNTRY GLOCKTOBRE WHICH WILL PROBABLY TURN INTO GLOCK VEMBER. THAT IS THE DAY THAT OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE IS OPEN FOR SIGNUP. I'VE GOT SOME MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT OBAMACARE.  I LIKE MY HEALTH CARE LIKE I LIKE MY WOMEN, UNIVERSAL AND WITH A WAITING LIST FOR NONESSENTIAL PROCEDURES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SINGLE PAYER. [ LAUGHTER ] SO FOR ME THE PRESIDENT'S PROGRAM FALLS SHORT OF THAT, SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A GIVEWAY TO INSURANCE AND  PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND 25 MILLION MORE PEOPLE WITH HEALTH INSURANCE IS BETTER THAN NOT THAT BUT OTHERS HAVE A DIFFERENT CRITIQUE.
IT SUCKS.
SORRY?
IT REALLY DOES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: LINDSEY GRAHAM WHERE IS YOUR ECCENTRIC SOUTHERN GENTILITY THAT LENDS ITSELF TO TENNESSEE WILLIAMS OR FAULKNERESQUE PARODY. I HAVE ALWAYS DEPENDED ON THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS THAT DON'T SUCK. NO THAT'S NO BUENO. THE POINT IS:  THIS UNITED STATES SENATOR ALONG WITH HIS REPUBLICAN BRETHREN BELIEVES THE HEALTH CARE PLAN WE'RE ABOUT TO INSTITUTE, IF I MAY PARAPHRASE HERE, SUCKS. [LAUGHTER] IS THERE SLIGHTLY MORE NUANCE TO THAT CRITIQUE?
WE BELIEVE THAT OBAMACARE IS A PROGRAM THAT WILL NOT WORK.
Jon: IT SUCKS. AND IT WON'T WORK! YOU MAY WONDER HOW REPUBLICANS KNOW THIS PROGRAM THAT IS YET TO BE SHALL ENJOY THAT? YEAH. WE'RE COMING FOR YOU COLBERT. NOW YOU MAY WONDER -- NOW, YOU MAY WONDER HOW REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM THAT IS YET TO BE INSTITUTED WILL SUCK AND NOT WORK. WELL, BECAUSE THEY'LL WORK TIRELESSLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS THE CASE.
OKAY, EVERYTHING SEEMS NORMAL. WHEN I SEE YOU ARE NEW TO OBAMA CARE AS WELL.
HOP UP HERE, LAY DOWN AND BRING YOUR KNEES TO YOUR CHEST.
IS THAT NECESSARY?
WE'LL TRY TO MAKE THIS QUICK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT:  THEY ARE THE USING THE SAME TACTIC TO SCARE US THAT BURGER KING USES TO TRY TO MAKE ITS LIFE BETTER. NOW I'M CONFUSED. REPEAL, DEFUND, INFORMATION BLACKOUT, MISINFORMED, APPEAL TO FEAR OF ANAL PUPPET FINGER BANGING. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUWHAT IF NONE OF THESE CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVING OBAMACARE WORK?
SOME REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE THREATENING TO SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT UNLESS THE PRESIDENT AGREES TO STRIP OUT FUNDING FOR OBAMACARE.
Jon: TO REPUBLICANS THAT'S NOT A THREAT THAT'S A GOAL. NWASN'T THAT THE THEME OF LAST YEAR'S REPUBLICAN CONVENTION? YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. I REMEMBER THAT NIGHT. [LAUGHTER] FILTHY. [LAUGHTER] HOW DO YOU -- LET YOU READ IT AT YOUR OWN PACE. [ LAUGHTER ] AS THE ROLL WENT AROUND THE ROOM SOME WERE DONE. SOME WERE JUST GETTING TO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN?
I BELIEVE NOTHING IS HURTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MORE, NOTHING IS HURTING THE ECONOMY MORE, NOTHING IS DAMAGING JOBS MORE THAN OBAMACARE.
NOTHING MAKES FOOD TAKES WORSE. NOTHING MAKES IT HARDER TO GET AN ERECTION, NOTHING RUINS BREAKING BAD LIKE OBAMACARE. OBAMACARE WILL MURDER YOUR HOPE.
WHAT WOULD A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DO?
BASED ON THE LAST SHUTDOWN IN 1995 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FEDERAL WORKERS SENT HOME WITHOUT PAY. MANY IF NOT MOST FEDERAL OFFICES AND PROGRAMS WILL BE CLOSED AND SHUTDOWN. DURING THE LAST SHUTDOWN 200,000 PASSPORT APPLICATIONS WERE NOT PROCESSED.
Jon: PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL BE FORCED TO GET AROUND ON AIR FORCE 3. THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT'S FLUFFER WILL BE FURLOUGHED. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY IS THAT -- WE COULDN'T HAVE POINTED THAT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION? [ LAUGHTER ] FOR GOD SAKES. MOVE ON. MOVE ON. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S A JOKE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT I DIDN'T GET TO IT BECAUSE IT MOVED ON. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. FORGET IT. LET'S GO. I GUESS IF YOU REALLY SINCERELY BELIEVE THIS IS A TERRIBLE PROGRAM THAT AMERICANS WILL HATE, I HAVE TO RESPECT YOUR PRINCIPLED STAND TED CRUZ.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN IS SIMPLE:  TO GET AS MANY AMERICANS ADDICTED TO THE SUBSIDIES, ADDICTED TO THE SUGAR BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IN MODERN TIMES NO MAJOR ENTITLEMENT HAS GONE INTO EFFECT AND THEN BEEN UNDONE.
Jon: BUT THE SUGAR IN YOUR METAPHOR IS IN THIS CASE HEALTH INSURANCE, SOMETHING THAT CAN LITERALLY BATTLE THE EFFECTS OF TOO MUCH SUGAR. YOU KNOW HOW AMERICA IS WITH ENTITLEMENTS IT'S LIKE CRACK TO US. YOU GIVE US ONE SMALL TASTE OF SOCIAL SECURITY SUDDENLY WE'RE SUCKING THE (bleep) OF NOT HAVING OUR OLD PEOPLE FREEZE TO DEATH AND LIVE ON CAT FOOD. THAT'S IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU ARE PROTECTING AMERICA FROM THIS TERRIBLE OBAMACARE PLAN THAT ONCE WE GET A TASTE OF WE'LL NEVER WANT TO BE WITHOUT. YOU ONLY WIN IF THE PROGRAM FAILS. OBAMACARE IS YOUR SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER. IT TURNS OUT THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT AFRAID WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET FINGER BANGED BY A PUPPET UNCLE SAM, THEY ARE AFRAID WE GONNA LIKE IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
