Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS  BEST SELLING AUTHOR, HIS NEW  BOOK IS A MEMOIR CALLED "JOSEPH  ANTON." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  SALMAN RUSHDIE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HOW ARE YOU?
NOT SO BAD, THANK YOU.
Jon: UM, WOW. (LAUGHTER)  "OWE JOSEF ANTON: A MEMOIR."  YOU WENT THROUGH HELL. BUT I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT  TO PLACE YOURSELF IN SOMEONE  ELSE'S SHOES UNTIL YOU READ  ABOUT IT IN VIVID AND QUITE BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN PROSE.
OH, THANK YOU.
Jon: OH, YOU'RE VERY  WELCOME. DESCRIBE THAT-- IT'S SORT OF  THIS INCREDIBLE DAY, IT'S  VALENTINE'S DAY. GO THROUGH THE DAY YOU FIND OUT  THAT ANOTHER NATION'S LEADER HAS  SINGLED YOU OUT TO DIE FOR A  BOOK YOU WROTE.
WELL, I WAS SITTING AT HOME,  I GOT CALLED AT HOME BY THE BBC.
Jon: THIS ISES PRETWITTER? (LAUGHTER)
PRETWITTER, PREFACEBOOK,  THERE'S NO CELL PHONE. THERE'S JUST FAX MACHINES. REMEMBER THOSE?
Jon: I DO REMEMBER THOSE. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, THAT'S HOW LONG AGO IT  WAS. ANYWAY, THE PHONE RINGS, A LAND  LINE PHONE JON. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WITH, LIKE, A CORD? (LAUGHTER)
YES, WITH, LIKE, A CORD. WITH THE HANDLE ATTACHED TO  THIS--
Jon: LIKE A LIME GREEN  KITCHEN PHONE AND YOU'RE JUST  TALKING AROUND LIKE-- YOU'RE IN  A ROBE MAKING A SMOOTHIE,  WHATEVER.
EXACTLY, HUMMING EARLY  BEATLES SONGS.
Jon: YES!
ANYWAY, THIS WOMAN SAYS TO ME  ON THE PHONE "HOW DOES IT FEEL  THAT-TO-KNOW THAT YOU'VE JUST BEEN SENTENCED TO DEATH BY THE  YATOLLAH KHOMEINI?"A  I THOUGHT "GOOD QUESTION."  (LAUGHTER)  AND I SAID SOMETHING STUPID LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T FEEL  THAT GOOD. AND THAN I RAN DOWN STAIRS AND  RIDICULOUSLY LOCKED THE FRONT  DOOR. (LAUGHTER)  SO THEN IT WAS OKAY.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT. PULL THE BLINDS.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jon: IT DOESN'T START TO  DAWN ON YOU-- IT'S SO  INTERESTING, TOO. YOU WRITE ABOUT THIS AS SORT OF  TH-T ANOTHER PERSON.
WELL, IT SORT OF WAS ANOTHER  PERSON, YOU KNOW? I-- I FELT-- I MEAN I FEEL NOW  LIKE THAT WAS HAPPENING TO  SOMEBODY ELSE. AND I WROTE THE BOOK BECAUSE I--  LIKE A NOVEL BECAUSE I FELT THAT  SOMEHOW MY LIFE TURNED INTO A  SORT OF SPY NOVEL. SUDDENLY THERE WERE ARMED  POLICEMEN AND THERE WERE-- I WAS  TAKE ON THE THE JAMES BOND  BUILDING ON THE THAMES WITH PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAD DOUBLE-O  PREFIXES AND THEN I WAS BEING  TOLD THAT THERE WERE  ASSASSINATION SQUADS ON THE WAY FROM SOMEWHERE, YOU KNOW? AND I MEAN THIS IS KIND OF-- NOW  IT MAKES A GOOD BOOK. AT THE TIME NOT SO GOOD. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SURE. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO GET GOOD  MATERIAL FOR A BOOK. SEBASTIAN JUNKER WILL SOMETIMES  CLIMB SOMETHING.
Jon: I THINK IF YOU CAN  AVOID BEING SENTENCED TO DEATH  BY THE AOEU TOE LACOMBE MAINNY  AND HAVE DEATH SQUADS, AVOID IT. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SO ALL TOGETHER THE  LESSON HERE IS NOT REALLY WORTH  A GOOD BOOK.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M A WRITER. I MEAN, SEBASTIAN JUNGER CLIMBS  MOUNTAINS, I DO STUFF FOR BOOKS.
Jon: WHEN YOU LOOK AT  WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY, IS IT  LIKE WATCHING THE SEQUEL TO A  TERRIBLE MOVIE THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED IN AND NOW OBVIOUSLY  YOU'RE HAPPY IT'S STARRING A  DIFFERENT ACTOR OR--
EXCEPT IT'S GOTTEN A (BLEEP)  IN THE CENTRAL ROLE. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: SO THIS IS VERY  INTERESTING. SO YOU LOOK AT THE GUY IN THE  CENTRAL ROLE HERE AND FOR YOU  YOU GO, OKAY, THAT GUYS AN AS  (BLEEP). IS IT STILL-- DOES YOUR HEART GO  OUT TO HIM OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE,  OH, WELL THIS GUY WAS TRYING TO  BE PROVOCATIVE. YOU WERE NOT TRYING TO BE  PROVOCATIVE. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN YOUR  MIND?
WELL, LOOK WE HAVE TO DEFEND  HIS RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH. WE HAVE TO. THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS ONE OF  THE MOST VALUABLE THINGS WE  HAVE. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO  NOT SAY HE'S A JERK.
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE EVEN JERKS HAVE THE  RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH BUT THEY'RE  STILL JERKS AND HE DID SOMETHING CLEARLY IN ORDER TO INCITE A  RESPONSE.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THE SAD THING IS THAT HE  GOT EXACTLY THE RESPONSE HE WAS  TRYING TO INCITE ONLY IN SPADES. SO IT'S LIKE BOTH SIDES KIND OF  COLLABORATING TO CREATE THIS  CALAMITY.
Jon: AND WHAT IS-- WHAT IS  THIS CALAMITY? BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IS THIS AN  EXERCISE IN LEADERS OF OTHER  COUNTRIES FINDING A DISTRACTION? HOW MUCH OF THIS DO YOU FEEL  LIKE WAS HEART FELT INSULT ON  THEIR PART AND HOW MUCH OF IT  WAS CYNICAL MANIPULATION OF THE  POPULATION?
I THINK IT'S MOSTLY CYNICAL  MANIPULATION. I THINK NOW UNFORTUNATELY IN  PARTS OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD  THERE'S A KIND OF OUTRAGE  INDUSTRY, YOU KNOW? WHERE PEOPLE ARE THERE TRYING TO  FINE THINGS THAT THEY CAN THEN  WIND UP THE TROOPS AND LAUNCH  THEM, USUALLY AT AMERICAN  TARGETS.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE THE  LEADER OF HEZBOLLAH SAYING THAT  THIS WAS ALL PLANNED BY U.S. INTELLIGENCE--
Jon: THEY HAVE NOT SEEN  WHAT WE CAN DO. (LAUGHTER)  WE DON'T PULL A LOT OF THIS  STUFF UP. YOU KNOW, WHAT STRUCK ME IS THIS  COMES FROM YOUTUBE AND IT'S SOME  GUY. IS IT BECAUSE IN THAT PART OF  THE WORLD THE GOVERNMENT DOES  CONTROL A LOT OF THE MATERIAL  THAT COMES OUT SO THEY HAVE A HARD TIME IMAGINING JUST  INDIVIDUALS UPLOADING SOMETHING  ON THEIR OWN?
OR THEY CAN BE FOOLED TO  THINK THAT IT'S SOMEHOW PART OF  THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO APPROVE IT  BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU LIVE A  PART OF THE WORLD THAT THE  GOVERNMENT HAS TO APPROVE  EVERYTHING. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH  OF YOUR WIFE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS  TO APPROVE IT. BUT IT'S-- NO, IT IS REALLY A  POWER PLAY. THIS IS PEOPLE TRYING TO BID UP  FROM EACH OTHER ABOUT WHO GETS  TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF THAT PART  OF THE WORLD.
Jon: IT WAS INTERESTING. EVEN IN IRAN WHEN THEY WERE  DOING THE GREEN REVOLUTION RIGHT  AFTER THE ELECTION THERE AND  AHMADINEJAD WAS REELECTED IN IRAQ AND ACCUSATIONS OF FRAUD  EVEN THEN THE GOVERNMENT WAS  SAYING "THESE ARE NOT OUR PEOPLE  RISING UP, THESE ARE WESTERN AGENTS WHIPPING UP, THESE ARE  SABOTEURS."
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: THERE IS NEVER ANY  SENSE THAT THERE'S FALLIBILITY.
NO, IT'S ALWAYS DEFLECTED  INTO AN ANTI-WESTERN-- ONE OF  THE THINGS I TRY TO SAY IN THE  BOOK IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WAY BACK IN THE DAYS OF FAX  MACHINES WAS A KIND OF PRELUDE,  A KIND OF PROLOGUE, IF YOU LIKE,  TO WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. BECAUSE I THINK YOU CAN DRAW A  STRAIGHT LINE FROM THEN TO NOW  AND SEE THE GROWTH OF THIS  PHENOMENON OF SORT OF ORGANIZED  OUTRAGE.
Jon: AND WHAT STOPS IT? IN YOUR MIND IS IT EVERYONE  STANDING UP AT ONCE OR IS IT  SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BURN OUT  WITHIN ITS OWN POPULATION?
I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THAT,  PROBABLY. AND I THINK THERE'S TIMES THAT  IT DOES. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THE RULE OF  THE AOEU TOE LA IS NOT POPULAR  IN IRAN. THE RULE OF THE TALIBAN WAS NOT  POPULAR IN AFGHANISTAN. SO THIS STUFF DOES SEEM TO TAKE  OVER, PARTICULARLY ATTRACT YOUNG  MEN WITH NOTHING BETTER TO DO,  NO GIRLFRIENDS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: RIGHT. OH, MY GOD, THIS COULD ALL BE  SOLVED BY J-DATE. WELL, NOT J-DATE, BUT I-DATE. THAT COULD DO IT. YOU HAVE TO GO, YOU'RE RUNNING. OTHERWISE WE WOULD TALK FOR--
OTHERWISE I'D STAY HERE.
Jon: YOU'D STAY HERE FOR  THINGS. "JOSEPH ANTON."  IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. AN INCREDIBLE STORY. SALMAN RUSHDIE, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
