FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HI, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT A PROGRAM WE HAVE FOR YOU IN THIS 2014. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT FROM "INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS" OSCAR ISAAC IS HERE. HE PLAYS LLEWYN DAVIS. A TALENTED MAN. WE'RE BACK. RECOVERING FROM THE HOLIDAYS IT'S A NEW START FOR US. NO MORE ANIMOSITY, NO MORE WAR ON CHRISTMAS. WE'LL EASE INTO THE NEW YEAR AND TALK ABOUT THINGS INNOCUOUS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS OR RELIGION BECAUSE THESE ARE HOT BUTTON TOPICS SO -- [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] HEY, SOME WEATHER, HUH.
I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED COLD LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE.
Jon: I'LL SAY. IT IS COLD OUTSIDE. I'LL TELL YOU THIS MORNING I HAD TO PUT MY HAND ON A WITCH'S TEAT TO KEEP THEM WARM. THAT'S ACTUALLY THE WITCH'S TEAT WAS WARMER THAN -- WHICH I THINK IS UNUSUAL. [ LAUGHTER ] ANY MORE WEATHER TALK? ANY MORE --
MINNEAPOLIS ST. PAUL MINUS 20 DEGREES.
I'VE NEVER FELT ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
YOU COULD BE INSIDE THE FREEZER AND YOU WOULD BE WARMER.
SOME CREW MEMBERS HAD TEARS COMING OUT OF THEIR EYES.
THINGS ARE FREEZING ON MY BODY THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WERE POSSIBLE TO FREEZE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: ARE YOU BREAKING UP WITH ME? [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THAT LINE. IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S ME IT'S JUST THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN WITH YOU THINGS ARE FREEZING ON MY BODY I DIDN'T KNOW WERE POSSIBLE TO FREEZE. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE AN ICE PENIS. THAT'S WHY. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS NICE. NO NAME CALLING. NO LEFT VERSUS RIGHT IDEOLOGICAL (bleep). IT'S JUST THE PLEASURE OF WATCHING NEWS ANCHORS SLOWLY PERISH FROM HYPERTHERMIA. THIS SNOW AND STILL CRIES OVER GLOBAL WARMING.
Warner: WAIT, WAIT, HOLD ON --
Jon: WAIT, WAIT. THE WEATHER WHERE YOU ARE ON A PARTICULAR DAY DOESN'T -- DON'T DO THIS.
WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING HOW GLOBAL WARMING ALARMISTS ARE STILL TRYING TO  PUSH THAT RADICAL POSITION.
GLOBAL WARMING I THINK IT'S GOING TO DIE THIS YEAR GIVEN THE INCREDIBLE COLD WEATHER WE'VE HAD THIS WEEKEND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: RIGHT NOW THERE ARE PARTS OF MY BODY THAT ARE GETTING ANGRY THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW COULD GET ANGRY AND -- THEY ARE GETTING SO ANGRY RIGHT NOW THAT IT'S -- I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHICH PART IT IS. IT'S MY BALLS. [LAUGHTER] RIGHT NOW I HAVE ANGRY BALLS. [LAUGHTER] I THINK I JUST INVENTED A NEW VIDEOGAME. [ LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU KIDS PLAYING ANGRY BALLS? HEY, YOU KIDS, STOP PLAYING ANGRY BALLS. [LAUGHTER] JUST WHEN YOU THINK IT'S OVER THEY PULL YOU BACK IN. â™ª  THERE YOU HAVE IT, WAR ON CHRISTMAS IS OVER. THE WAR ON CARBON BEGINS. GLOBAL WARMING ONE MORE LIBERAL GCONSPIRACY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF SCIENTIFIC D EVEN THOUGH THE MODELS OF GLOBAL WARMING PREDICT EXTREMES OF WEATHER, NOT JUST WARMING, APPARENTLY PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC STUDY CAN BE, LIKE A FICUS TREE, DESTROYED IN ONE COLD WEEKEND.
FORGET THIS GLOBAL WARMING. IT'S JUST MY OPINION.
THAT'S YOUR OPINION. THAT'S YOUR (bleep) OPINION. [ LAUGHTER ] IT MEANS NOTHING. [LAUGHTER] SORRY. GUYS, SETTLE DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S YOUR OPINION. BASED ON ITS FLAVOR I THINK LEAD PAINT IS GOOD TO DRINK. THAT'S MY OPINION. PEEING INTO THE FOUNTAIN THE SAME TIME AS ANOTHER PERSON IS A GOOD WAY TO SWITCH SOULS WITH THEM. MY OPINION.
IF 97 DOCTORS TOLD YOU THE LUMP ON YOUR LUNG WAS SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT AND THREE SCIENTISTS, DOCTORS TOLD YOU NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT.
IF 97 WERE PAID TO TELL ME THERE WAS A LUMP ON MY LUNG AND IT WAS BAD, I'D LISTEN TO THE THREE.
Jon: YOU KNOW THAT IS HOW DOCTORS GET PAID, RIGHT? YOU GO TO THEM AND THEY CHARGE TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT YOUR PROBLEM. ALTHOUGH I THINK I FIGURED OUT WHERE THE LUMP IS. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. LET'S FOLLOW THIS CLIMATE SCIENCE MONEY.
I GOTTA TELL YOU, I THINK THESE SCIENTISTS ARE LAUGHING FROM THEIR LAVISH LABORATORIES AND VACATIONS UP IN THE ARCTIC IN THE NICE BOATS THAT ARE WELL EQUIPPED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THIS ARCTIC? [LAUGHTER] THIS LAVISH BOAT? [LAUGHTER] YEAH, THAT'S THE DREAM, MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] I REMEMBER THINKING OH, (bleep) WHEN I GET OLDER I'M GOING TO TAKE ONE OF THEM ARCTIC RESEARCH CRUISES AND MONITOR (bleep) BECAUSE ALL THE LADIES BE LIKE DAMN YOUR READINGS ARE SO ACCURATE. [ LAUGHTER ] I GET IT. YOU CAN'T TRUST THESE SCIENTISTS. THEIR JUDGMENT IS CLOUDED BY MONEY. WHY DO YOU OPPOSE THESE SCIENTISTS?
I THINK IT BORDERS ON LUNACY TO THROW DARE I SAY TRILLIONS AT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT NOT BE.
IT'S ANOTHER GOVERNMENT ATTEMPT TO EXTORT MONEY FROM BUSINESSES.
Jon: THE INTEGRITY AND RESEARCH OF CORPORATIONS SAVING MILLIONS BY DENYING CLIMATE CHANGE IS UNIMPEACHABLE. BUT KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE GLOBAL WARMING THOUSAND-AIRES. I NEVER TRUSTED THEM SINCE I FOUND OUT ONE OF ELEMENTS ON THE PERIODIC TABLE, GOLD. [LAUGHTER] PRETTY CONVENIENT. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A PRETTY EASY WAY TO SOLVE THIS. BRING ON SOMEONE WHOSE OPINION WE ALL RESPECT AND WHOSE EXPERTISE IN THE FIELD CANNOT BE DENIED. THIS WHOLE GLOBAL WARMING HOAX. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: NOOOO. OH. OH, THE DOCTOR IS IN.
THIS WINTER IS BRUTAL. I MEAN I'M IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW. THE AIRPORTS WERE CLOSED. EVERYTHING IS CLOSED. IT'S FREEZING.
Jon: OH, SO GLOBAL WARMING MUST BE A HOAX BECAUSE, I MEAN MR. TRUMP WOULD NEVER CONCEAL BALD-FACED TRUTH OR GO THROUGH ANY EFFORT TO HIDE WHEN SOMETHING IS CLEARLY RECEDING OVER THE YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, FOR MORE LET'S GO OUT TO SENIOR CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT JESSICA WILLIAMS. JESSICA WILLIAMS OUTSIDE -- HOW DID CLIMATE CHANGE, WHICH IS AN ISSUE OF SCIENCE BECOME PART OF THE CULTURE WAR?
JON, THIS ISN'T ABOUT SCIENCE. IT'S ABOUT  LIBERTY. IF WE ADMIT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL THAN THE LIBERALS CAN DICTATE WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T DO. NOBODY TELLS AMERICAN WHAT'S WE CAN BURN, WHO WE CAN EAT, WHO WE CAN SHOOT OR HOW MANY TIMES WE CAN SHOOT IT.
Jon: HOW MANY TIMES? JESSICA? I DIDN'T REALIZE -- WE ACCEPT LIMITS ON ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. SPEED LIMITS, AGE LIMITS FOR BUYING ALCOHOL, LIMITS ON MARRIAGE.
WHERE DOES THE GOVERNMENT GET OFF TELLING ME WHO I CAN FORBID FROM MARRYING? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THE CULTURES -- WE'LL STILL FIGHT ABOUT STUFF BUT LET'S FIGHT ABOUT SOLUTIONS NOT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S HAPPENING. THE POINT IS.
Jon: OH, MY GOD WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR HEAD. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
NOTHING.
Jon: HAVE YOU BEEN TO A DOCTOR?
YEAH, SOME QUACK AT MOUNT SINAI TOLD ME I HAD A GAPING WOUND IN MY SKULL. LIKE I'M GOING TO FALL FOR THAT OLD CON.
Jon: YOU DO SEEM TO HAVE A MASSIVE HEAD WOUND.
SURE, JOHN BELIEVE THE GUYS WHO GET PAID TO TAPE UP SKULLS. I WENT TO MY FRIEND AND I'M FINE.
Jon: IS YOUR FRIEND A DOCTOR?
BETTER? HE IS A VERY RICH MAN. HE HOSTS A REALITY SHOW, HAS A HEAD FULL OF NATURAL HAIR.
Jon: ARE YOU TAKING MEDICAL ADVICE FROM DONALD TRUMP?
NO, HIS NAME IS DONALD TR -- OH, YES I AM. HE SAID MY SKULL JUST LACKS AMBITION.
Jon: YOUR SKULL LACKS A CHUNK OF BONE. I CAN SEE YOUR BRAIN.
JON, THAT IS YOUR OPINION. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? HEY WHY, WHY DID YOU SEND THE --
Jon: I DIDN'T -- JESSICA WILLIAMS, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
