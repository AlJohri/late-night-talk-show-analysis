(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK! WE'RE TALKING WITH GENERAL TONY ZINNI. THE BOOK IS "BEFORE THE FIRST SHOTS ARE FIRED," AND, OBVIOUSLY, THE FIRST SHOTS HAVE BEEN FIRED HERE. LET'S TALK ABOUT AMERICA'S STRATEGY AS, YOU KNOW, THE WORLD'S SUPERPOWER. ARE WE SEEING THE LIMITS OF OUR POWER, THAT WE CANNOT GO IN, CREATE THESE POWER VACUUMS AND THEN NATION BUILD TO THE POINT WHERE A COUNTRY IS STABLE ENOUGH AND FRIENDLY ENOUGH TO OUR PURPOSES THAT WE CAN PROJECT OUR POWER EFFECTIVELY IN THAT REGARD?
I THINK WE'RE CERTAINLY SEEING THE LIMITS OF OUR ABILITY TO TRANSITION NATIONS THAT MAY BE LOCKED IN THE NINTH OR TENTH CENTURY INTO SOMETHING LIKE JEFFERSONIAN DEMOCRACY, FREE MARKET ECONOMY. WE KID OURSELVES WITH THE SHAKE AND BAKE DEMOCRACY THAT WE TRY TO IMPOSE AND ELECTION DOES NOT EQUAL DEMOCRACY. WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT ON THE CHEAP. I THINK CERTAINLY BACK AT THE END OF WORLD WAR II, GEORGE MARSHALL, TRUMAN, KENNON, OTHERS UNDERSTOOD YOU CAN'T DO THIS ON THE CHEAP. YOU HAVE TO COMMIT TO IT. FOR US TO GO IN AND MILITARIZE A SOLUTION, OUR SOLDIERS ARE TRYING TO REBUILD NATIONS, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE EXPERTISE FROM OUR OTHER AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SIZE AND THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS. AND WE GET MIRED DOWN AND WE DON'T HAVE THE COST OR BE WILLING TO EXPEND THE COST NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THIS. YOU KNOW, SO WE'VE FORGOTTEN HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE. WE'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO APPLY ALL OUR ELEMENTS OF POWER.
Jon: HAVE WE FALLEN TOO IN LOVE WITH THE MARSHALL PLAN MENTALITY? YOU KNOW, GERMANY AND JAPAN, FOR ALL THEIR ISSUES, WERE HOMOGENOUS AREAS WHERE THERE WAS A REAL NATION STATE THAT HELD TOGETHER. THESE ARE MUCH MORE FRACTIOUS, MUCH MORE TRIBAL. IN MANY RESPECTS, WESTERN INVENTIONS OF BORDERS, THE IDEA THAT WE CAN CREATE POWER VACUUMS AND REBUILD THEM TO SEEM STABLE SEEMS FOOLHEARTY.
WELL, IT ABSOLUTLY IS. I MEAN, YOUR POINT ABOUT THE BORDERS, THIS IS SYKES-PICOT AT THE END OF THE WORLD WAR I WHERE THE FRENCH AND BRITISH CARVED UP NATIONS ACROSS TRIBAL AND RELIGIOUS LINES, THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR TODAY. I THINK OUR INVOLVEMENT OUT THERE CAN'T BE ALONE. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS.
Jon: RIGHT.
REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS, INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS. I'M STILL WAITING FOR THE U.N. RESOLUTION THAT AUTHORIZES US TO USE FORCE HERE.
Jon: RIGHT.
I MEAN, IN THE FIRST GULF WAR, WE HAD IT.
Jon: IT'S THE GREATEST THREAT TO THE WORLD WE'VE EVER SEEN, AND YET WE CAN'T GET EVEN A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS THIS ISN'T SO GOOD OUT OF THE UNITED NATIONS.
AND WHERE ARE THE EUROPEAN NATIONS IN THIS ALLIANCE? BESIDES THE FRENCH, THERE'S NOBODY ELSE THAT SHOWING UP.
Jon: BUT EVEN THEN THAT'S STILL A WESTERN POWER THAT'S IMPOSING IT'S VALUE AND ITS MILITARY SOLUTIONS. WHERE ARE THE NATIONS WHO BEAR SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FUNDING AND CREATION OF THESE GROUPS? SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, TURKEY, TURKEY'S BORDER REMAINS OPEN. THE QATARIS FOR GOD SAKES HAVE CERTAINLY FUNNELED MONEY TO SOME OF THESE TERRORIST GROUPS. THE SAUDIS AS WELL. WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY ON THAT REGARD.
I THINK IN MANY CASES YOU'RE SEEING NATIONS THAT ARE TRYING TO PLAY BOTH SIDES. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I.S.I.S. WOULD DESTROY THE ROYAL FAMILY IN SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER EMIRS IN THE REGION IN A HEART BEAT AND THEY'RE CAUGHT BETWEEN TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER TO USE FORCE AND REMOVE THEM, TRYING TO BUY THEM OFF AND THEY'RE CONFUSED. DO THEY FOLLOW US? WILL WE BE THERE? WILL WE ENDURE THROUGH ALL THIS? SO, YOU KNOW, THEIR PROBLEM IS THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SHUT THEIR EYES TO THIS PROBLEM AND THEIR TRYING EVERY METHOD POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE IT MANY OF WHICH JUST EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM THEY'RE FACING.
Jon: UNTIL THEY HAVE CLARITY IN THE FIGHT, HOW CAN WE BE EXPECTED TO EVEN BE IN SERVICE OF STABILIZING OR HELPING?
WELL, YOU CAN'T IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE, AND IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
Jon: YEAH.
I WAS IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH, GEORGE BUSH MADE THE CASE FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ.
Jon: I'M NOT FAMILIAR BUT GO AHEAD.
YEAH. HE SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THIS WAS ABOUT THE FORCES OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY AGAINST THE FORCES OF AUTHORITARIANISM AND EVIL. I HAD AN ARAB FRIEND NUDGE ME AND SAY THIS IS ABOUT PERSIANS VERSUS ARABS. YOU'RE ABOUT TO RELEASE A DEVIL THAT WE'VE TRIED TO KEEP CONTAINED. THE ARAB ON THE OTHER SIDE NUDGED ME AND HE SAID THIS IS ABOUT SHIA VERSUS SUNNI, YOU'RE GOING TO RELEASE A RELIGIOUS WAR. WELL, THEY WERE ALL RIGHT. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTOOD THOSE TWO OTHER LEVELS AND THE SETS OF  CONSEQUENCES.
Jon: MAN, WE WERE TWO WEEKS INTO THE BOMBING, I THINK, BEFORE AMERICA REALIZED THERE WERE TWO FORMS OF ISLAM. I DON'T EVEN THINK WE KNEW SUNNI AND SHIA. PEOPLE WERE LIKE,  WHERE'S SYRIA AGAIN? WHAT'S HAPPENING? YOU KNOW, WE SEEMED TO LEARN ABOUT RELIGION AND GEOGRAPHY AFTER WE BOMB IT. IT'S REALLY, IT'S NUTS.
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF MINUTES, YOU'LL STICK AROUND TO EXPLAIN?
YEP.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. "BEFORE THE FIRST SHOTS ARE FIRED" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. GENERAL TONY ZINNI. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
