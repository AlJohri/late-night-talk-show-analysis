Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS. HER NEW MEMOIR IS CALLED "THEN AGAIN." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM DIANE KEATON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M VERY PLEASED. SO NICE TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M OKAY. HOW ARE YOU, JON?
Jon:  WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER IN SO--
I KNOW, I KNOW.
Jon:  WE WERE COSTARS.
"FIRST WIVES."
Jon:  THEY LEFT WHAT DID YOU IN THE MOVIE--
YOU'RE CUTE. OKAY, I'M SORRY. GO ON.
Jon:  IT'S THE MAKEUP. AND IF I WERE TO TAKE--
THAT'S SO NOT TRUE.
Jon:  IT'S THE MAKEUP AND LIGHTING AND SUIT. CAN I TELL SOMETHING-- PEOPLE MEET ME ON THE STREET AND I'M DRESSED NORMALLY AND I DON'T  HAVE MY MAKEUP ON AND THEIR FIRST RESPONSE IS ALWAYS THERE, "ARE YOU OKAY?" ( LAUGHTER ) YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT TAKES.
YOU'RE SUCH A LIEAR.
Jon:  TO HEALTHY ME UP. I ACTUALLY TAKE TRANSFUSIONS OF KEITH RICHARDS' BLOOD. HOW TERRIBLE THAT-- LET ME SHOW YOU THIS. THIS IS THE BOOK "THEN AGAIN." I WAS EXPECTING AND I WAS ALL  SET FOR A VERY SUPERFICIAL, SHOW BUSINESS ANEC DOTES. A FAMOUS ACTRESS HAS WRITTEN A BIOGRAPHY. THIS IS A BEAUTIFULRY WRITTEN, DEEPLY PERSONAL, VERY WELL OBSERVED, IN SOME WAYS LOVE LETTER TO YOUR MOTHER, BUT ALSO  ABOUT YOUR FAMILY-- IT REALLY IS A WONDERFUL BOOK. WHO WROTE THIS? ( LAUGHTER )
YOU'RE KILLING ME. WELL, I WROTE IT. AND THAT-- I WAS THE PERSON WHO WROTE THE BOOK. I'M DIANE KEATON. IT SAYS THAT THERE.
Jon:  WHAT? OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
I DID WRITE IT.
Jon:  IT REALLY IS. IS IT HARD TO REVISIT-- YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER WAS A VERY COMPLICATED, ARTISTIC, TALENTED  WOMAN, BUT SHE KEPT THESE DIARIES.
RIGHT 85, 85 JOURNALS. AND I NEVER READ THEM IN THE COURSE OF HER LIFETIME BECAUSE, OF COURSE, MY MOTHER WAS SO-- SHE WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL WOMAN. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR MOM?
Jon:  SHE'S OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ).
DOROTHY, DEAR DOROTHY --
Stephen:  MY MOTHER'S VERY NICE. SHE'S WONDERFUL.
Stephen:
SHE WAS A FANTASTICALLY ACTIVE LISTENER SO THAT MEANT I GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION.
Jon:  FOUR KIDS, THOUGH, FOUR KIDS.
OH, YEAH, FOUR. I WAS THE FIRST OF FOUR. BUT SHE WAS JUST AN ASTONISHING HUMAN BEING. AND I DON'T KNOW, TO ME, THOSE 85 JOURNALS, I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HER. I WANTED HER TO CONCENTRATE ON ME.
Jon:  SURE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I WAS THE DAUGHTER WHO JUST CHERISHED EVERYTHING THAT SHE HAD TO GIVE ME. I WASN'T THE DAUGHTER WHO I SHOULD HAVE BEEN, OF COURSE, WHICH WAS TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHO MY MOTHER WAS AS A HUMAN BEING SEPARATE FROM ME. GET IT? SO IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR ME TO GROW UP.
Jon:  DID SHE EVER SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO YOU?
NO, BECAUSE SHE KEPT TO HERSELF. I THINK THAT HER RELEASE AND HER CATHARTIC EXPERIENCE IN LIFE WAS TO WRITE THESE JOURNALS. AND SO FINALLY, I BEGAN TO READ HER JOURNALS, AND BASICALLY, THIS BOOK IS USING HER JOURNALS WITH MY WORDS AND JUXTAPOSING OUR LIVES TOGETHER, AND IN SOME  WAY I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, MY WISH IN LIFE WAS, OBVIOUSLY, TO BECOME AN ACTRESS. AND I FEEL LIKE THE REASON THAT HAPPENED WAS, OF COURSE, BECAUSE OF MY MOTHER, DOROTHY.
Jon:  AND ONE OF THE NICE PARTS OF THE BOOK IS TO SEE THEM  TAKE SUCH GREAT PLEASURE IN YOUR SUCCESS.
I KNOW.
Jon:  AND COME TO SEE YOU, EVEN IN-- THERE'S A GREAT LITTLE NOTE IN THERE YOU WROTE  ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE IN "HAIR," IN THE 70s.
OH, YES, I WAS IN "HAIR."
Jon:  SHE WAS IN "HAIR." YOU WRITE-- YOU KNOW, IT'S THIS  WHOLE HIPPIE THING. I DON'T CARE FOR IT. I'M IN "HAIR," BUT, YOU KNOW.
IT WAS A LITTLE ODD, YEAH.
Jon:  YOU WERE A CALIFORNIA KID.
COMPLETELY, THE BEACH. ALWAYS THE BEACH. WHERE DID YOU GROW UP.
Jon:  CALIFORNIA, THE BEACH.
THIS IS WHAT I MEAN, NO.
Jon:  NO, NEW JERSEY. VERY SIMILAR EXCEPT, OBVIOUSLY-- IT'S LIKE CALIFORNIA WITH-- IF YOU WOULD IMAGINE CALIFORNIA  WERE A GAS REFINERY. SIMILAR-- VERY SIMILAR TO... ( APPLAUSE ) NO, NEW JERSEY IS BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
I'M BEGINNING TO PICTURE IT NOW.
Jon:  BUT THIS ASTONISH AGO WHEN YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL, YOU DEVELOPED A CRUSH ON  AN ACTOR.
JUDY GARLAND. I HAD A LOT OF CRUSHES. -- HE WAS MY FIRST UNATTAINABLE. BUT WHILE-- YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID TO ME. WE WROTE NOTES IN MRS.  HOPKIN'S CIVICS CLASS, AND HE WROTE BACK  TO ME ONCE AND SAID, "YOU'LL MAKE A GOOD WIFE ONE DAY." ( LAUGHTER )  AND I THOUGHT, I DON'T WANT TO BE A WIFE. I WANT TO BE A HOT DATE.
Jon:  RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I DIDN'T WANT THAT AT ALL? I'M NOT A HOT DATE.
Jon:  CAN I TELL YOU, SOMETHING. HE WAS ALWAYS KIND OF AN-- GARLAND.
DAVE GARLAND. HE WAS THE FIRST. NEXT WAS I WORKED AT THE BROADWAY THEATER IN SANTA ANA AND I REMEMBER SEEING "SPLENDOR  IN THE GRASS." YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW THAT MOVIE AT ALL, ANY OF YOU HERE, BUT "SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS" STARRED WARREN BEATTY AND-- DID YOU SEE IT?
Jon:  YES.
SO ANYWAY, HE WAS TO DIE FOR. I HAVE NEVER, EVER SEEN ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL ON FILM I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
Jon:  IT'S ALMOST LIKE A POSTER--
AND I MET HIM.
Jon:  YOU DIDN'T MEET HIM. YOU GUYS HAD--
I ACTUALLY KNEW HIM. I --
Stephen:  YOU WENT OUT WITH HIM!
YES, I DID.
Jon:  MY FAVORITE PART OF ABOUT THAT IS YOU ALSO WENT OUT WITH WOODY ALLEN BEFORE THAT, AND FOR GUYS LIKE ME, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANT FOR GUYS LIKE ME, WOODY ALLEN IS DATING  DIANE KEATON? LIFE IS POSSIBLE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. AND THEN WHEN YOU, OBVIOUSLY, WENT ON TO WARREN BEATTY, WE ALL WENT, YEAH, I SAW THAT COMING. THEN LIFE MEAT SENSE AGAIN.
NO, NO, NO,. WE'D IS A GOOD-LOOKING MAN.
Jon:  PLEASE. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT-- BELIEVE ME, IN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS, HE'S THE ONE I RELATE TO. BUT LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES. UP AGAINST WARREN BEATTY...
LOOKS-WISE, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
Jon:  PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING-WISE.
HE HAD THOSE COOL GLASSES. REMEMBER?
Jon:  THAT'S WHAT ALL THE LADIES ARE LOOKING FOR. "HEY, ARE YOU NEARSIGHTED?" ( LAUGHTER )
YOU'RE HORRIBLE.
Jon:  CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING, THEN AGAIN, IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. YOU HAVE TO GET THIS. IT'S SO WELL DONE.
THANK YOU.
Jon:  AND IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THE NEXT MOVIE WE DO TOGETHER I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO TRY TO STAY IN. DIANE KEATON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU.
