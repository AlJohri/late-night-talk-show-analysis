JAN 9TH, 2014.
FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE  A VERY GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT THE GREAT SCARLETT JOHANSSON IS GOING TO JOIN US A LITTLE BIT LATER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT FIRST, AS YOU KNOW, THERE'S A BIT OF DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY. INCOME INEQUALITY. THE LEFT THINKS IT'S UNFAIR BECAUSE OF SYSTEMIC DISADVANTAGES  BUILT IN FOR THE LESS AFFLUENT. THE RIGHT THINKS IT'S UNFAIR BECAUSE APPARENTLY  THOSE DISADVANTAGES AREN'T SYSTEMIC ENOUGH. [LAUGHTER] AND, THEY DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT THE RICH ARE BEING DEMONIZED ESPECIALLY GIVEN HOW COMPASSIONATE THEY ARE TO  THE DISGUSTING POOR.
THE MAKERS MAKE IT.  THE GOVERNMENT TAKES IT FROM THEM  AND THEN THEY GIVE IT TO THE TAKERS..
A NATION OF TAKERS.
WELLFARE CHEATS.
FREELOADERS. THE MOOCHER CLASS OUT THERE. 99% OF THEM HAVE A REFRIGERATOR
SUBSIDIZED FREELOADERS WHO WOULD RATHER WATCH JERRY SPRINGER ON A COUCH, OR OCCUPY A PARK, THAN GO OUT EARN A LIVING.
THERE'S A LOT MORE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SUCK ON THE TEAT  OF THE STATE. YOU KNOW THAT MOOCHER CLASS THAT JUST COMES RIGHT UP TO THE STATE AND IS ALL LIKE, OOH, LOOK AT THEM TEATS. [LAUGHTER] GIVE ME SOME OF THAT  EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW THE STATE'S VERY VOLUPTOUS. IT'S ACTUALLY HONESTLY HARD TO LISTEN TO THEM TALK ABOUT IT. I WISH THERE WAS SOME SHORTHAND WAY TO REPRESENT THEIR FEELINGS FOR THE RECIPIENTS OF THESE BENEFITS GRAPHICALLY. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS ON THEIR MORNING SHOW. WHAT NOTE DO YOU GIVE THE GRAPHICS DESIGNER FOR THAT? GIVE ME THE DIRT STAINED HAND OF THE MOOCHY POOR BURSTING ALIEN-LIKE THROUGH THE HEART OF THIS ONCE MIGHTY NATION, AND THEN GIVE A LITTLE RAGTIME UNDERNEATH. YOU KNOW, IT'S A MORNING SHOW. CAN YOU IMAGINE, THAT WHEN IT REASONABLY CAME TIME TO TRY AND  TEMPORARILY EXTEND LONGTERM UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, WHICH AVERAGE, I DON'T KNOW, 256 DOLLARS A WEEK, AND RAN OUT IN DECEMBER, CAN YOU IMAGINE, THE RIGHT MUST HAVE HAD MANY  REASONS WHY THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.
THE PEOPLE LOSING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS HAVE HAD THEM FOR A LONG TIME. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A TEMPORARY MEASURE.
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A TEMPORARY FIX.
WE GRADUALLY EXTENDED AND EXTENDED AND EXTENDED.
WE WOULD CONSIDER EXTENDING EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IF IT WAS PAID FOR.
ONE WAY HE SUGGESTED IS TO ELIMINATE NEW HEALTHCARE SUBSIDIES FOR THE POOR.
Jon: WHAT A GREAT DEAL. I WOULD HAPPILY EXTEND YOUR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR THE MERE COST OF YOUR HEALTHCARE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE A WONDERFUL O. HENRY STORY WITH AN IRONIC TWIST ENDING. LOOK HONEY, I SOLD ALL OUR FOOD TO GET YOU THAT DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT. WHAT? I STOPPED TREATING MY CANCER TO GET YOU THIS BANANA. [ LAUGHTER ] WE SHOULD HAVE TALKED. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT MAKING SURE THESE PROGRAMS ARE PAID FOR AND FINITE IS THE WORST IDEA.  IF THAT WERE THEIR CONSISTENT POSITION ABOUT BENEFITS TO OTHER GROUPS.  FOR INSTANCE,  MAYBE THOSE WHO PUNCH THEIR HANDS TO THE CHEST OF AMERICA TO RECEIVE THE TEMPORARY BUSH TAX CUTS. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE TAX CUTS PERMANENT.
WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO OFFSET THE COST OF A  DELIBERATE DECISION TO REDUCE TAX RATES. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET INTO THIS WASHINGTON GAME AND THEY'RE FUNNY ACCOUNTING OVER THERE.
THIS IS EXISTING TAX POLICY. IT'S BEEN IN PLACE TEN YEARS. WHY DID IT ALL OF A SUDDEN BECOME SOMETHING THAT MADE -- WE "PAID FOR."
Jon: WHY DO WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER TEN YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] GIVING MONEY TO RICH PEOPLE DOESN'T COST ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL THE PAYMENT WE NEED IS THEIR BEAUTIFUL SMILES. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE THE REAL OUTRAGE ISN'T THE BONUSES OR TAX CUTS THAT GO TO THE HIGHEST EARNERS, THE REAL OUTRAGE IS THE SHOWCASE SHOWDOWN LAVISH VALUE OF THE GOLDEN PARACHUTE WELFARE PACKAGES THIS COUNTRY NOW DISPENSES.
FOOD STAMPS, SNAP CARDS, DISABILITY, UNEMPLOYMENT CHECKS, PUBLIC HOUSING. THE KATO INSTITUTE DID A STUDY, JUST CAME OUT,  SAID THE FULL PLATE OF WELFARE BENEFITS NOW PAYS MORE THAN $12 AN HOUR IN HALF THE STATES. IN OTHER WORDS SITTING ON THE COUCH EATING BON-BONS IS MORE FINANCIALLY LUCRATIVE. WHAT THE [BLEEP]? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NO YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT IS A PERFECT ENCAPSULATION OF THE LIFESTYLE OF THE POOR AND LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED. BON-BON WISHES AND COUCH-SITTING DREAMS. BUT I GUESS, MAYBE THERE IS A REAL POINT IN THERE.  WHAT'S YOUR INCENTIVE TO WORK  40 HOURS A WEEK AT A (bleep) JOB WHEN YOU MAKE THE SAME (bleep) SALARY NOT WORKING? I GUESS ONE SOLUTION WOULD BE, RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE SO THAT  THERE WOULD BE A DISCREPANCY. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE COULD BE JUST ABOUT THE WORST THING HE COULD DO FOR THE JOBS MARKET.
WAGES AREN'T ARBITRARY, THEY'RE NOT BASED ON WHIM, THEY'RE NOT BASED ON FEELING, AND THEY'RE NOT CHARITY.
SOMEONE FRESH OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL THAT DIDN'T GET A DIPLOMA.  THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY BASIC SKILLS  DO YOU THINK THEY DESERVE $15 AN HOUR?
WHY STOP AT $15 AN HOUR? WHY NOT RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE $100,000.
Jon: WHY NOT! WHY NOT PAY PEOPLE IN COCAINE AND UNICORNS. BUT I GET IT, YOUR SOLUTION IS, WE CAN'T MAKE EMPLOYMENT MORE ATTRACTIVE. WE CAN ONLY MAKE UNEMPLOYMENT LESS ATTRACTIVE. BECAUSE ANYTHING ELSE IS A MORAL HAZARD.
WHEN YOU ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE ON UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR 99 WEEKS YOU ARE CAUSING THEM TO BECOME PART OF THIS PERPETUAL UNEMPLOYED GROUP.
DEPENDENCY DOES NOT GET PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY.  JOBS DO.  A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LAZY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BECOMING LAZIER.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. YOU HAVE BEEN ON UNEMPLOYMENT. AS A STRUGGLING ACTOR BEFORE.
YES. SEE SOME OF THE MOVIES I'VE DONE? DO YOU THINK I WANTED TO DO ALL OF THOSE MOVIES? I MEAN I'LL BE HONEST, YOU SOMETIMES HAVE TO GO TO WORK. MAYBE IT'S NOT THE JOB YOU WANT BUT YOU TAKE THE JOB.
Jon: EXACTLY, ACTOR DEAN CANE IS RIGHT. I DON'T CARE IF THE AUTO PARTS PLANT SHUT DOWN AFTER 40 YEARS. GET YOUR ASS OFF YOUR COUCH, STOP EATING THOSE BON-BONS AND STAR IN THE DOG WHO SAVED CHRISTMAS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELL LET'S BE HONEST. SURE WE FEEL BAD FOR THE DESERVING UNEMPLOYED BUT ARE WE REALLY SURE THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE COLLECTING THEIR FAT $256 A WEEK REALLY NEED IT?
WELFARE FRAUD OUT OF CONTROL.
FRAUD RAMPANT IN MANY PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
I HAVE SPOKEN TO PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU KNOW I'M BETTER OFF GETTING UNEMPLOYMENT THAN GOING OUT AND FINDING A JOB.
A SURFER DUDE IN CALIFORNIA TOLD US, "WHY WORK WHEN THE GOVERNMENT PAYS ME NOT TO WORK?"
FRAUD, MISMANAGEMENT AND ABUSE.
TRUST ME, MILKING THE SYSTEM, OKAY?
YOU HAVE MANY MANY PEOPLE, I'LL BET IT'S A BIG MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SITTING BACK AND NOT PULLING THEIR WEIGHT.
Jon: PARDON ME TO BET AGAINST SUCH A SUCCESSFUL CASINO OWNER, BUT I WILL WAGER THE PERCENTAGE OF UNEMPLOYMENT SCAMMERS IS LESS THAN A BIG MAJORITY. STILL THE POSITION IS CLEAR BECAUSE A FEW PEOPLE ON UNEMPLOYMENT MIGHT BE COMMITTING FRAUD, EVERYBODY'S BENEFITS SHOULD END. NOBODY 'S SHOULD GET EXTENDED. I'M CURIOUS. HOW DID THEY APPLY THE SAME REASONING WHEN PEOPLE ON WALL STREET WERE CAUGHT  DEFINITELY COMMITTING FRAUD.
YES, WALL STREET HAS A PERCEPTION PROBLEM. BUT YOU KNOW, DON'T THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER.
AND THE FACT THAT YOU MAY HAVE A FEW BAD APPLES.  THERE ARE BAD APPLES IN ANY SITUATION.
YOU'RE RIGHT. THERE'S A FEW BAD APPLES.  THE MARKET WILL ALWAYS HAVE A FEW BAD ACTORS AND YOU FIND THEM AND YOU SHOOT THEM, OK, BUT DON'T KILL THE MARKET.
ALL RIGHT.
Jon: AND BY ACTOR I MEAN CEOS AND BY SHOOT THEM I MEAN PAY THEM MILLIONS TO LEAVE. ALRIGHT SO WHEN IT COMES TO WALL STREET YOU CAN'T JUDGE EVERYONE BY A FEW BAD APPLES. I MEAN WHO HASN'T HAD A COUPLE BAD ACTORS AND APPLES, RIGHT? BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE UNEMPLOYED IF YOU FIND A FEW BAD APPLES, YOU NAPALM THAT (bleep) ORCHARD.  I THINK I'M BEGINNING TO GET IT. IF IT'S A POLICY THAT BENEFITS THE RICH, THEN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PAID FOR, SHOULD LAST FOREVER, AND IS GOOD FOR AMERICA. BUT IF IT BENEFITS THE POOR, WE CAN'T AFFORD IT, WE SHOULD END IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND IT WILL DESTROY OUR NATION FROM WITHIN. BECAUSE WHEN YOU GIVE MONEY TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE IT, IT CORRUPTS THEM. BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY RICH HAVE A MONEY IMMUNITY BUILT UP ALREADY. [ LAUGHTER ] HANDOUTS DON'T HURT THEM MONEY IS THE ROOT ALL OF EVIL FOR ANYONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY JUST LIKE SMALL POX IS TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
