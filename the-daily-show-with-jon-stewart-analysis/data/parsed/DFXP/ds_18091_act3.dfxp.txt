Jon:  NO, I HAVEN'T.
NOW I CAN'T AWARE MY HIJAB. I SAW ANN COULTER ABOUT THREE  TABLES AWAY, AND THE NEGATIVE  ENERGY.
Jon:  YOU CAN EVEN FEEL  IT ACROSS THE ROOM?
JUST LIKE A ZOMBIE WILL NOT  GENERATE THAT KIND OF NEGATIVE  ENERGY.
Jon:  REALLY?
YES, YES.
Jon:  YOU KNOW, I HAD NO  IDEA. DID YOU HAVE A NICE TIME-- THIS  "TIME 100" DINNER.
YEAH.
Jon:  THAT MUST HAVE BEEN  A LOT OF FUN. I PERSONALLY THINK PEOPLE'S MOST  BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE IS THE HONOR  THAT SHOULD BE GOING TO YOU, BUT THE TIME 100 IS ALSO A GOOD  HONOR. WHAT WAS THE DINNER LIKE?
OH, THEY HAD THIS, LIKE  LITTLE ENTREE WHERE'S THEY HAVE,  LIKE,UN, THREE PEAS, AND EVERY PEA HAD A STORY. LIKE THIS DUCK WAS LEFT TO ROAM  INTO THE FIELDS OF VERMONT. LIKE, DID IT HAVE A PEDICURE  BEFORE YOU KILLED IT? DID IT HAVE A MASSAGE? ITS NAME WAS FRANK. THE DINNER WAS GREAT. JIMMY KIMMEL WAS AN INCREDIBLE  HOST, AND HE MENTIONED ME IN THE  TOAST. AND HE SAID, WE APPRECIATE WHAT  YOU'RE DOING, YOU'RE RISKING  YOUR LIFE. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TO  JUST COME HERE AND STAY AT MY  HOUSE. HE CAN GET OUT.
Jon:  RIGHT.
IT WAS A GREAT DINNER.
Jon:  HEARSAY THE I THINK  I WANT TO ASK YOU. YOU HAD THESE ACCOLADES FROM  "TIME" MAGAZINE, FROM AROUND THE  WORLD. IN EGYPT THEY LOVE YOU. DOES THIS HELP YOU WITH THE  EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT THAT NOW  WANTS TO ARREST YOU AND SILENCE AND YOU DO ALL THESE THINGS? DOES IT MAKE THEM ANGRIER TO SEE  HOW POPULAR YOU'VE BECOME-- IT  DOES MAKE THEM ANGRIER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
YES! YES! I LOVE IT.
Jon:  WHY?
HERE IS THE THING. YOU KNOW, ALL AROUND THE WORLD  THERE ARE ACTIVISTS,  JOURNALISTS, TV ANCHOR BEING INCARCERATED AND HUNTED DOWN FOR  THEIR OPINIONS. BUTUN WHAT? ONCE GUAFTER A-- YOU GO AFTER A  JOKER? YOU CAN'T TAKE A JOKE. I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF  HUMOR, BUT DO YOU HAVE TO BE A  SORE LOSE ?ER HERE IT IS, THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY BY  THEIR OWN AGENDA AND THEY WILL  TELL YOU, "OH, YES, IT'S A  DEMOCRACY. YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT, BUT  BE POLITE. BE NICE. BE PRESENTABLE."  IT'S LIKE WHAT IS THAT?
Jon:  RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ). IS IT THE IDEA, TOO, THEY DON'T  UNDERSTAND BY GOING AFTER  SOMEONE WHO IS TEASING THEM, THAT NOT A PROJECTION OF POWER  AND STRENGTH.
GREAT WEAK GLNS GREAT  WEAKNESS AND A VERY SURPRISING  NEWS.
THEY ARE INSECURE. THEY ARE LOATS INTO THEIR  TEENAGED YEARS. ( LAUGHTER ). THEY STILL HAVE PIMPLES AND THEY  HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEIR-- I  DON'T KNOW-- BODILY HAIR.
Jon:  SURE, I UNDERSTAND.
Jon:  WE'VE ALL BEEN  THERE, BASSEM, WE'VE ALL BEEN  THERE.
MIDTRAINIAN PEOPLE CAN TELL  YOU MORE --
I'M WITH YOU. I'M WITH YOU. WHEN THEY BROUGHT YOU IN FOR  QUESTIONING, THEY COME AND THEY  ARREST YOU-- I WANT TO MAKE SURE I GET THE CHARGES RIGHT BECAUSE  I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO--  DO THAT-- THEY SAID THEY WERE DEN DWRAITING, SPREADING FALSE  NEWS WITH THE AIM OF DISRUPTING  PUBLIC ORDER AND DIMINISHING THE PRESIDENT'S STATURE.
YES.
Jon:  GOING D.C.LY AND  ABROAD ALTHOUGH HE SEEMS TO BE  DOING A VERY GOOD JOB OF DIMINISHING HIS OWN STATURE.
THERE ARE NEW ONES COMING UP.
Jon:  WHAT ARE THE NEW  ONES?
PROPAGATING AND PROMOTING  HOMOSEXUALITY, AND OBSCENITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, ALL  RIGHT. UN WHAT? WE ACTUALLY-- WE HAVE A SHOW  LIKE THAT. WE CALL IT "GLEE."
INCITING VIOLENCE AND  PROMOTING CIVIL WAR.
Jon:  WHAT!
YEAH, YEAH, AND INSULTING THE  STATE OF PAKISTAN.
Jon:  WHOA! YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE IN  PAKISTAN NOW, TOO?
THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  IS THERE NO SENSE,  THOUGH, THAT WHEN YOU WERE DOING  THIS VERY SAME THING TO MUBARAK AND PEOPLE WERE TAKING TO THE  STREETS, THAT THAT WAS-- THEY  WERE ENCOURAGING THAT. BUT NOW THAT THEY ARE IN POWER  THEIR IDEA S, BOY, THAT WAS  GREAT, BUT SHUT UP."
YEAH, HERE'S A BETTER THING. NOW THEY SAY, WE'RE SITTING  ACROSS THE TABLE, IT'S LIKE LOOK  AT HIM SITTING WITH THE JEWS. THE JEWS ARE PROMOTING HIM. AMERICA IS BEHIND --
THEY PUT THAT OUT THERE. IT'S A CONSPIRACY.
WHY DOES AMERICA-- WHY DOES  AMERICA SUPPORT BASSEM? FAZ AMERICA DIDN'T TELL MUBARAK  TO LEAVE, AND AMERICA IS NOW  SUPPORTING THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND GIVE THEM  BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MILITARY  AID.
Jon:  THAT AMERICAN  SUPPORT IS VERY ACCEPTABLE.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A FLEXIBLE  SUPPORT. WHEN WE NEED IT, IT'S NICE. WHEN PRESIDENT MORSE SEON THE  COVER OF THE "TIME" IT'S LOOK AT  THAT. BUT WHEN I AM ON THE COVER IT'S  TRAITOR. NOW WE IN THEIR MEDIA.
Jon:  DON'T YOU THINK IF  JEWS CONTROLLED THE MEDIA,  THOUGH, WE WOULDN'T BE ON BASIC CABLE RIGHT NOW? DON'T YOU, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN  MYSELF A NETWORK JOB? ( APPLAUSE )  THEY JUST DON'T,. HERE'S WHY YOU HAVE MY UNDYING  SUPPORT AND FRIENDSHIP. ARE YOU DOING WHAT I TAKE FOR  GRANTED ALL THE TIME AND FORGET  SOMETIMES. YOU ARE CARVING OUT THE SPACE  FOR PEOPLE TO BREATHE AND  EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN A WAY THAT I THINK IS INCREDIBLY ADMIRABLE. AND I JUST-- I JUST HAVE NOTHING  BUT THE FONDEST--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  STICK AROUND. WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE  ABOUT IT. BASSEM YOUSSEF. WE'LL BE BACK.
