Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT HE WAS THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE IN BOTH THE GEORGE W. BUSH AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONS. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "DUTY:  MEMOIRS OF A SECRETARY AT WAR." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ROBERT GATES. SIR -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THE BOOK IS OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE SUFFERED AN -- APPARENTLY YOU WROTE ABOUT CHRIS CHRISTIE AND THERE WAS RETRIBUTION. [ LAUGHTER ]
ACTUALLY, I FINALLY BROUGHT ABOUT BIPARTISAN ACTION, RETRIBUTION.
Jon: RETRIBUTION. PEOPLE ARE VERY ANGRY AT YOU INSIDE WASHINGTON FOR HAVING THE TEMERITY TO WRITE A MEMOIR. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHY BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE WRITE MEMOIRS ABOUT THEIR TIME IN WASHINGTON. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU FACE SUCH SCRUTINY FOR THIS?
I THINK FIRST OF ALL I'M PRETTY BLUNT AND CANDID ABOUT THE MESS IN THE PLACE. AND, AS I SAY, IT'S REALLY NOT JUST ABOUT THE FACT THAT I WAS BROUGHT TO WASHINGTON TO TRY TO SALVAGE TWO WARS BUT I HAD TO WAGE WAR AGAINST THE CONGRESS, AGAINST MY OWN BUILDING, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND AT TIMES AGAINST THE WHITE HOUSE, OFTEN JUST TO GET THE RIGHT THINGS DONE IN TERMS OF SUPPORT FOR MEN AND WOMEN SERVING IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ AND EVEN SUCH HORRIBLE THINGS AS CUTTING THE DEFENSE BUDGET.
Jon: RIGHT. HAVE YOU BEEN SURPRISED THAT THE MEDIA HAS GLOMMED ON TO MAYBE THE MORE SENSATIONAL ASPECTS?
NOT SURPRISED. I'VE BEEN AROUND TOO LONG FOR THAT. BUT I THINK THAT -- PEOPLE HAVE KIND OF PROVEN ONE OF THE POINTS IN THE BOOK WHICH IS WASHINGTON IS SO POLARIZED THAT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING IS USED TO PROVE ONE POLITICAL POINT OR ANOTHER. SO PEOPLE HAVE CHERRY-PICKED INDIVIDUAL QUOTES IF IT SUPPORTS THEIR POSITION. SO THERE'S STUFF IN THIS BOOK. IF YOU ARE FOR BUSH THERE'S STUFF. IF YOU ARE AGAINST HIM. THERE'S MATERIAL. SAME THING WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY HONEST ACCOUNT. AND I BASICALLY WROTE IT FOR ALL THOSE KIDS WHO SERVE TO SHOW THEM, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PASSION AND STRONG FEELINGS THAT BOTH PRESIDENTS HAD ABOUT THESE WARS AND ABOUT THE TOUGH DECISIONS THEY HAD TO FACE.
Jon: RIGHT. AND TO SEE  IT SENSATIONALIZED LIKE THAT  IN THE MEDIA FOR CONFLICT, IT WAS UPSETTING TO ME I MEAN I THINK FOR ME THE BIG QUESTION IS WHO'S BETTER? [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, AND I GUESS YOU COULD JUST ANSWER THAT. BUSH, I GUESS NOD ONCE, OR OBAMA JUST DO THAT, OR HOWEVER YOU WANT TO...
HOW ABOUT PUNTING? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IT IS -- IT'S VERY INTERESTING HOW CONGRESS -- LIKE YOU SAY, IF YOU ARE FOR ONE POLITICAL PARTY OR ANOTHER YOU CAN FIND THINGS ABOUT OBAMA OR BUSH THAT ARE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. CONGRESS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY COMES OUTLOOKING VENAL AND SMALL. I THOUGHT BOY THAT SOUNDS ACCURATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND WHAT A REVELATION.
Jon: AND WHAT A REVELATION.
I'M SURE THIS COMES AS NEW NEWS TO THE ENTIRE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BUT WHERE I GET INTO IT IS IN THE SPECIFICS ON HOW THEY ARE THAT WAY.
Jon: IT'S OFTEN TIMES WHEN YOU WOULD BE TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF CONGRESS IN TERMS OF PROGRESS ON THESE VARIOUS SITUATIONS AND THEY WOULD BEHIND THE SCENES BE SOMEWHAT THOUGHTFUL AND  CIRCUMSPECT AND IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS BE COMPLETE BRAYING IDIOTS.
WELL, I SAY IN THE BOOK THAT THE EFFECT OF THE RED LIGHT ON A TELEVISION CAMERA GOING ON HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AS A FULL MOON DOES ON WEREWOLVES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THE BUREAUCRACY OF IT, STRATEGY OF IT ALL THAT STUFF IS FASCINATING BUT ON A GLOBAL PICTURE, THE IDEA OF -- YOU KNOW, YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON IN IRAN RIGHT NOW. IT'S DETERIORATED ONCE AGAIN TO TERRIBLE VIOLENCE, AFGHANISTAN AS WELL. DOES IT POINT TO AN IDEA MAYBE THAT AMERICA FELL A LITTLE BIT TOO IN LOVE WITH A MARSHALL PLAN IDEA AFTER WARS AND WE'RE APPLYING LESSONS WE LEARNED IN WORLD WAR 2 TO THESE NEW FIGHTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THEY'RE NOT APPLICABLE AND THAT STRATEGY IS DOOMED TO FAILURE TO SOME EXTENT?
ONE OF THE POINTS I MAKE IN THE BOOK IS THAT IN RECENT DECADES, I BELIEVE PRESIDENTS WHEN CONFRONTED WITH A FOREIGN CHALLENGE OR A FOREIGN PROBLEM, HAVE BEEN TOO QUICK TO REACH FOR A GUN TO SOLVE IT. I SAID IN ANOTHER BOOK I WROTE 15 YEARS AGO THAT THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET IN WASHINGTON IS THAT THE BIGGEST DOVES WEAR UNIFORMS BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN WAR AND THEY HAVE SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES AND THEY'VE BEEN SENT INTO BATTLE, SENT INTO CONFLICT AND SEEN POLITICAL SUPPORT EVAPORATE BECAUSE OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, THE LACK OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP OR WHATEVER. SO ONE OF THE THEMES IS THAT WE NEED BE A LOT MORE CAREFUL WHEN WE DEPLOY OUR FORCES AND WHEN WE USE MILITARY FORCE  AND BE WILLING TO ADMIT THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND THAT WE KNOW VERY LITTLE, USUALLY, ABOUT OUR ADVERSARIES. AND WE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS LIKE ALL WARS WILL BE SHORT, WE'LL BE IN AND OUT, THAT'S 12 YEARS AFTER WE WENT INTO AFGHANISTAN. SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME CAUTIONARY TALES IN THE BOOK THAT I HOPE  WILL HAVE SOME RELEVANCE AS WE LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS IN SYRIA, WE LOOK AT THE ISSUES WITH IRAN YOU WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER.
Jon: IMMEDIATELY THAT'S WHAT SPRINGS TO MIND BECAUSE YOU BRING UP AN INTERESTING POINT. AND IT'S A POINT THAT HAS  BEEN BROUGHT UP CYCLICALLY. EISENHOWER WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND THAT YOU BUILD THIS MACHINE AND SOMEONE'S GOING TO WANT TO USE IT ON ANOTHER COUNTRY. DOES IT TROUBLE YOU THEN TO SEE THERE'S A CERTAIN RIGIDITY IN THE WAY THAT WE LOOK AT THE WORLD AND THE WAY THAT WE LOOK AT AMERICAN POWER AS BEING INFALLIBLE.
WE HAVE MORE POWER THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD. I DO BELIEVE WE'RE AN INDISPENSABLE NATION. THERE'S REALLY NOT ANY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM THAT CAN BE SOLVED WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES BEING INVOLVED OR LEADING THE EFFORT. BUT THE REALITY IS WE CAN'T SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. AND EVERY TIME THERE'S AN OPPRESSION OR SOME TERRIBLE THING HAPPENING INTERNATIONALLY THE ANSWER IS NOT NECESSARILY TO SEND IN AMERICAN TROOPS. WE NEED TO PAY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- MORE ATTENTION.
Jon: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK. WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE WITH ROBERT GATES. THE BOOK IS CALLED "DUTY," WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
