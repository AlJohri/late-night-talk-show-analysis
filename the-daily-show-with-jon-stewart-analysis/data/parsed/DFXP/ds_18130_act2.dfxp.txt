[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME BACK. BEFORE THE BREAK, THE NEWS MEDIA  HAS BEEN IN LONDON ALL WEEK. IT IS IS CULMINATING IN A LONG,  TENSE WAIT THIS AFTERNOON FOR  THE BIG MOMENT.
EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR WHEN  WILLIAM AND KATE AND THE BABY  MAKE THAT APPEARANCE.
John: SMALL LANGUAGE POINT  BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THE MONEY  SHOT WAS NINE MONTHS AGO AND IT'S WHAT GOT US ALL INTO THIS  MESS. THIS AFTERNOON WILLIAM AND KATE  DELIVERED INTO THE WORLD "IT'S A  BABY! "A BABY! IT LOOKS JUST ABOUT LIKE EVERY  OTHER BABY. SO THAT'S IT. THAT IS THE BIG FINISH. IF ONLY IT'S A PICTURE OF  SOMEONE ELSE'S BABY THAT I DON'T  CARE ABOUT, THAT IS WHAT FACEBOOK IS FOR. WE HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE OF  THE BABY. FIRST TO SAMANTHA BEE OUTSIDE  ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL IN LONDON. SAM, HOW IS EVERYTHING THERE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
JOHN, IT IS NOT GOOD. OKAY. WE SPENT NINE MONTHS LETTING  THIS STORY GROW INSIDE OUR  NETWORK. AND THAT WAS JUST A TINY HOLE IN  THE SCHEDULE FOR IT. AN UNNATURALLY TINY HOLE LIKE  TRYING TO SHOVE A WATERMELON  THROUGH A BIRD HOUSE. BUT JUST WHEN WE THOUGHT WE  COULDN'T PUSH THIS ON TO THE  SCHEDULE ANYMORE, IT RIPPED THROUGH AND POPPED OUT SCREAMING  AND COVERED IN NEWS GO. AND NOW IT FEELS SO EMPTY INSIDE  LIKE WE HAD NO REAL ENDING TO  THIS STORY NOW THAT IT'S BROKEN SNON ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT THE  MEDIA HAS...
POST-PARTUM DEPRESSION, JOHN. THAT HURTS SO MUCH. FROM DRINKING GUINESS TO EATING  FRIED WHATEVER THIS IS. I'M NEVER GOING TO DROP THIS  ROYAL BABY WEIGHT.
John: JESSICA WILLIAMS, WHERE  ARE YOU?
I'M AT THE PREMIERE ROYAL  BABY BOUTIQUE TODDLERS AND  TIARAS. THIS IS WHERE THE ROYAL BABY IS  REGISTERED.
John: YOU DON'T REALLY NEED  TO GET A GIFT. THIS BABY HAS EVERYTHING.
OKAY. LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE FLUSHED IT  DOWN THE LOO. THE PRINCESS CAMBRIDGE  REGISTERED FOR TONS OF STUFF  HERE. IT'S AWESOME. BESIDES THE TRADITIONAL, THIS  IS, YOU KNOW, A CLASSIC CHOICE. YOU HAVE THE CORGI SADDLE. HE COULD JOIN AS GRAND PAPPY. ON FOX HUNTS. IF YOU WANT TO SPEND THE BIG  BUCKS, YOU CAN REGISTER FOR THE  ENTIRE COUNTRY OF IRELAND.
John: WHOA! A BIG GIFT, RIGHT. John: THAT'S A GIFT HE MAY  NOT BE HAPPY TO BE GIVEN. LET'S GO NOW TO AL MADRIGAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
(YELLING). John: AL, JUST FOR THE  RECORD, DO YOU HAVE ANY ACTUAL  NEWS?
LET ME CHECK AND GET MY NOTES  HERE. HERE'S SOME NEWS, JOHN. (YELLING). [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THEY WILL USE ANY EXCUSE TO  THROW A PARTY.
WHY ARE WE HERE AGAIN? John: THE BIRTH OF THE NEXT  KING OF ENGLAND.
OH, YEAH, LOOK AT THIS. ANY EXCUSE FOR A PARTY, RIGHT. SERIOUSLY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
[BLEEP] KNOWS WHAT I'M  TALKING ABOUT.
John: I THINK THAT'S A FAKE  HORSE.
NO, THIS IS A REAL HORSE. John: NO, I'M PRETTY SURE  THAT'S A FAKE HORSE.
NO, IT'S NOT. I WOULDN'T SWIMMING IN THE HOTEL  POOL. THREE OF THEM.
John: BUT THAT MAY BE. BUT THAT IS TWO MEN IN A HORSE  COSTUME.
IT'S A FAKE HORSE. COME HERE. HORSY. HORSE.
YOU LIED TO ME. John: WE'LL BE RIGHT
