FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. I'M BACK. I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, LEON PANETTA, HE'S GOT A NEW BOOK THERE CALLED "WORTHY FIGHTS." SPEAKING OF WHICH, WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH ISIS. THAT'S THEM. TERRORIST ARMY RAMPAGING  ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. AN ORGANIZATION SO VILE, JUST  THINKING ABOUT IT IS ENOUGH TO  MAKE YOU VOMIT NON-STOP FOR  HOURS ON END. WHILE SITTING ON THE TOILET DRENCHED IN SWEAT. I, I, I -- I HAD A BAD DAY YESTERDAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THE POINT IS THIS: SEAFOOD NEWBERG IS NOT ALL -- OH NO, I'M SORRY. THE POINT IS THIS: THIS GROUP IS A GRAVE THREAT TO ALL THAT CIVILIZATION HOLDS DEAR. President Obama: THIS GROUP  HAS TERRORIZED ALL WHO THEY  COME ACROSS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.
IT'S MORE FRIGHTENING THAN ANYTHING I THINK I'VE SEEN.
THEY ARE AN IMMINENT THREAT  TO EVERY INTEREST WE HAVE. President Obama: WE WILL HUNT DOWN TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN OUR COUNTRY WHEREVER THEY ARE.
Jon: WHEREVER! EVEN UNDER YOUR BED. LOOK OUT! WAIT, OH THERE THEY ARE. NEXT TO JASON, I THINK. OR MAYBE THAT'S THE CHAINSAW MASSACRE GUY. HERE'S HOW SERIOUS THE THREAT  IS. THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL  COMMUNITY IS COMING TOGETHER  TO STOP IT.
THE UNITED STATES BOASTS A  COALITION OF MORE THAN 40  COUNTRIES AS PART OF THIS  ANTI-ISIS EFFORT.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE  BOASTING. I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE  BOASTING ABOUT THE COALITION. I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE BOASTING ABOUT IT. I MEAN, YEAH, IT'S BIGGER THAN THE AVERAGE COALITION. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU WERE TO MEASURE, IF YOU WERE TO MEASURE OUR COALITION, WE DON'T -- YOU KNOW. WE DON'T NEED TO MEASURE. LET'S JUST SAY I HAVEN'T HEARD  ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE  COALITION, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
SO, TWO WEEKS AFTER THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES BEGAN AN ALL OUT BOMBING CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE EVIL THAT ISIS, LET US SEE THE GLORIOUS RESULTS.
ISIS MILITANTS ARE ADVANCING QUICKLY ON THE CITY OF KOBANI WHICH IS RIGHT ON THE TURKISH BORDER. ISIS HAS ALREADY PREPARED A  HUGE FLAG TO FLY OVER KOBANI  ONCE IT CAPTURES THE CITY.  [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEP]. ARE THEY TAKING OVER THE CITY OR PREPARING IT FOR A RAIN DELAY? WHAT KIND OF -- ROLLING OUT THE ISIS TARP WHENEVER IT RAINS. WAIT A SECOND, I THOUGHT WE WERE TAKING CARE OF THESE GUYS. WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS, WHAT'S GOING ON? MAYBE THE TERRAIN IS TOO  TOUGH, OR ISIL IS MADE OF SHADOW.
THE SYRIAN TOWN OF KOBANI WILL FALL TO THE MILITANTS.
THE ISIS FIGHTERS QUITE  CASUALLY WALKING UP TO KOBANI.
TANKS TOWARDS KOBANI, MOVING THROUGH FAIRLY OPEN SPACES.
ISIS TANKS, ISIS VEHICLES FREELY ROAMING AROUND THE COUNTRYSIDE FOR THE LAST FIVE DAYS.
Jon: ISIL FIGHTERS APPARENTLY SAYING THINGS LIKE YOO WHOO, TAKING NUMEROUS SUNBATHING BREAKS. LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WHOLE DESTROY AND DEGRADE PLAN? DON'T YOU GUYS REALIZE IF THEY TAKE OVER KOBANI OUR ENTIRE YOGURT SUPPLY WILL BE IN JEOPARDY? HOLD ON -- I'M BEING TOLD THAT'S CHOBANI. KOBANI IS APPARENTLY A SYRIAN KURDISH TOWN ON THE BORDER OF TURKEY. AND DOES NOT HAVE REAL  BLUEBERRIES MIXED IN IT. MY POINT IS THIS. YOU GUYS SAID ISIS IS THE MOST  EVIL THING SINCE HITLER'S  SLICED BREAD. FOR GOD'S SAKES, YOU BROKE INTO  DANCING WITH THE STARS TO TELL  US WE'RE HUNTING DOWN MEMBERS  AND ASSETS WHEREVER THEY ARE. WELL, THESE GUYS ARE BURNING TANK DONUTS ON A KOBANI HILLTOP, AND THEY ARE ISIS, SO WHAT'S UP?
THE CITY OF KOBANI MAY WELL FALL TO ISIS, AND THE UNITED STATES IS NOT OVERLY CONCERNED.
U.S. OFFICIALS SAYING THAT IT'S  NOT A TOP PRIORITY.
BROADLY FOCUSED, NOT JUST ON  ONE CITY AND ONE TOWN. WE HAVE TO STAY BROADLY  FOCUSED ON THE WHOLE REGION.
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE UNITED STATES FOR US TO ALSO STEP BACK AND REMEMBER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE.
IT'S NOT A KEY CITY  STRATEGICALLY. IT MATTERS BECAUSE A LOT OF  PEOPLE WILL GET SLAUGHTERED AND  THAT'S AN AWFUL, AWFUL THING, BUT ISIS COMING TO THE TURKISH  BORDER, IT'S NOT A MAJOR  CROSSING.
Jon: SO KOBANI SEEMS TO FALL SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A TOWN ABOUT TO FALL TO THE GREATEST THREAT WE'VE EVER SEEN, AND, YOU KNOW, A SLOW DRIP FROM A KITCHEN SINK.
FOR MORE WE'VE GOT SENIOR WAR CORRESPONDENT JORDAN KLEPPER. HE IS IN KOBANI TONIGHT. JORDAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THE TOWN, JORDAN, THE TOWN MUST BE NEAR PANIC.
NO, THEY TOTALLY GET IT. AS ONE BRAVE KOBANI RESIDENT TOLD ME, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? WE CHOSE TO, WE CHOSE TO LIVE IN A PLACE OF  NO STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE. OUR BAD.
Jon: THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE, QUITE FRANKLY.
NOT AT ALL. THEY'RE COMPLETELY AT PEACE. SURE, YOU MIGHT THINK, BORDER  TOWN RIGHT BETWEEN OUR ALLY  AND OUR ENEMY MIGHT BE WORTH TAKING OUT AN ISIL TANK OR TWO, BUT YOU'D BE WRONG, JON. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT IN CHARGE AND YOU DON'T HAVE A WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN TO FIGHT ISIL.
Jon: WHICH IS WHAT AGAIN?
CLASSIFIED. OR IT'S STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. OR --
Jon: SO IN KOBANI THEY ACCEPT THEIR FATE.
NOT ONLY THAT, THEY'RE DOING WHATEVER THEY CAN TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. MARKING THEIR WALLS WITH X'S. PAINTING TARGETS ON THEIR ROOFS. PRE-WEAKENING SCHOOLS AND  HOSPITALS.
Jon: WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, WHY DON'T THEY JUST KNOCK THE CITY DOWN THEMSELVES.
WELL, THEY DON'T WANT TO  EMASCULATE ISIL. THEY WANT TO SET THEM UP TO  SUCCEED. THEY'RE JUST LOOSENING THE LID  ON THE PICKLE JAR A LITTLE. SO WHEN ISIL COMES ALONG, OH LOOK, HONEY, YOU'RE SO STRONG,  YOU DID IT ALL BY YOURSELF. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SO AT THIS POINT  WHAT'S THEIR ATTITUDE IN KOBANI  TOWARDS THE UNITED STATES?
OH, THEY (BLEEP) HATE US, JON.
Jon: THANK YOU, JORDAN. JORDAN KLEPPER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
