Jon: WELCOME BACK. EVERYBODY KNOWS THE EXPRESSION, NEITHER RAIN NOR SNOW NOR SLEET NOR HAIL  SHALL KEEP THE POSTMAN FROM THEIR APPOINTED ROUNDS. IT DOES TURN OUT THAT PRECIPITATION IN A VARIETY OF TEMPERATURES ISN'T THE  ONLY THREAT TO MAIL. WYATT CENAC HAS MORE.
THE POST OFFICE, EVERYBODY LOVES IT, FOR JUST 44 CENTS THEY'LL DELIVER YOUR MAIL ANYWHERE, WHETHER  IT'S WISHING SOMEONE A MERRY CHRISTMAS OR FLIRTING WITH PRISONERS. BUT THAT TIME MAY BE OVER.
DEEP IN DEBT AND FACING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LAYOFFS, IT'S NO SECRET THE  U.S. POSTAL SERVICE IS DESPERATE TO STAY AFLOAT.
Reporter: THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES FOR PRESIDENT OF THE POSTAL WORKERS UNION CLIFF GUTHIE.
THE POST SERVICE SAY GREAT LADY, WHERE THE FLAG FLIES IN AMERICA N ALL THESE  SMALL COMMUNITIES. TO START BACKING THAT, SOLELY FOR BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, I THINK IT'S KIND OF ADD IN A WAY.
BUT YOU'RE SAYING WE DON'T NEED TO BACK THAT LADY  THAT LADY, LET'S JUST SLOWLY CHOKE HER OUT.
CHOKE HER OUT OR I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE PROPER TERM EITHER.
THE TRUTH IS THERE'S PROBABLY NO I HAD YOM FOR MASTURBATION WHICH COULD  EXPLAIN WHAT CONGRESS IS DOING WITH THE POST OFFICE, BUT HERE ARE JUST SOME OF THE WAY THESE WOULD LIKE TO  [BLEEP] IT.
ELIMINATING SATURDAY DELIVERY, CLOSE 3700 POSTAL LOCATIONS, LAYOFF 120,000 WORKERS.
THAT'S CLEARLY NOT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.
MOST AMERICANS WANT THE SERVICE. BUT THE REALITY IS WE MAY NOT HAVE TEN MORE YEARS WITH THE POST OFFICE.
TEN YEARS.
I WENT TO ANY TOWN NEW JERSEY TO WARN THE MASSES.
THE POST OFFICE IS IN DANGER.
IN DANGER OF WHAT?
OF RUNNING OUT OF BUSINESS.
I'M TIRED OF SORTING THROUGH THE MAIL AND BASICALLY FINDING NOTHING  AND JUST CHUCKING IT ALL.
90% OF THE TIME IT ENDS UP ON SOMEWHERE ON THE STOOP, USUALLY IN A PUDDLE.
WE GET SOMETHING LIKE 30 PIECES AV JUNK MAIL A DAY COMING TO THIS HOUSE. SO I HAVE TO PAY THE POST OFFICE NOT TO SEND THE MAIL TO THE HOUSE.
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU PAY THE POST OFFICE NOT TO SEND YOU MAIL.
YEAH, I HAD TO GET A PO BOX.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET YOUR MAIL?
E-MAIL.
JUST HOW BAD IS IT FOR THE POST OFFICE?
I WROTE A SONG WITH MY BUSINESS PARTNER, WHICH WAS DEALING WITH OUR FRUSTRATION  ON HOW WE DEAL WITH THE U.S. POST OFFICE IN OUR BUSINESS LIVES.
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S SO BAD, A LADY I MET RANDOMLY WROTE AND RECORDED A SONG ABOUT HER HATRED OF THE POST  OFFICE ♪ THAT'S NOT MY JOB ♪ ♪ I'M SORRY ♪  ♪ THIS MESSED UP YOUR DAY ♪ ♪ THIS IS THE WORK FOR WHICH YOU ARE PAID ♪ ♪.
Reporter: MY GOD, THE U.S. MAIL HAS LOST THE MIDDLE AGE SUBURBAN WIGGER MOM.
♪ THAT'S MOTT MY JOB ♪ ♪.
HOW MANY LETTER DOES I HAVE TO WRITE YOU TO NEVER HEAR THAT SONG AGAIN?
EVERYWHERE I LOOK THE POST OFFICE WAS OUTNUMBERED.
GET OUT OF HERE. GET OUT. THIS IS POST OFFICE TERRITORY, GET OUT OF HERE.
EVEN THE POSTMASTER GENERAL IS URGING WIDE SPREAD LAYOFFS AND CLOSINGS BY NEXT YEAR. LUCKILY CLIFF HAD THE PERFECT WAY TO REBOOT THE U.S. PS.
THAT MAY BE THE NEXT STEP FOR THE UNION IS TO YOU KNOW PUT COMMERCIALS OUT THERE  SAYING SEND YOUR MOM A LETTER. IT WOULD BE A NOBEL EFFORT IN THIS COUNTRY FOR PEOPLE TO START WRITING LETTERS AGAIN.
SO WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE AN AD FOR VAGISIL, THE POST OFFICE PRODUCED THIS  COMMERCIAL ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE THE MAIL.
GIVE YOUR CUSTOMERS THE ADDED FEELING OF SECURITY A PRINTED RECEIPT PROVIDES WITH MAIL.
THAT'S YOUR PITCH, U.S. MAIL, WE GIVE YOU A RECEIPT. IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE MAIL COOL AGAIN. AND I KNEW JUST HOW TO DO IT.
ACTION!
HI, I'M HAROLD.
AND I'M KUMAR.
SAVE THE MAIL.
WHAT'S UP, MAIL.
MAIL!
MAIL!
YOU MUST BE KRASESY NOT TO WANT TO SAVE THE POST OFFICE.
YOU BET, CELO AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS A BIG MAIL FAN, CHRISTINA AGUILERA.
HUH? SHE'S NOT DOING THIS.
MAIL!
IT'S LIKE TEXTING WITH A PENCIL.
SAVE THE MAIL!
TELL THEM TONY HAWK.
MAIL IS GNARLEY.
WITHOUT MAIL YOU COULDN'T DO THIS.
SO USE YOUR VOICE TO SAVE THE MAIL.
THIS JUST HAS TAKEN MY MAIL FROM ME ♪ ♪ AND DELIVERED ♪  ♪ IT TO SOMEONE ELSE ♪ ♪.
MAIL! YOU CAN SHIP YOUR WEED.
YES.
NO, THAT'S FEDEX.
FEDEX SUCKS.
YOU KNOW WHY? WITHOUT MAIL THE TREES WIN.
MAIL, JAMMING IN YOUR BOX.
JAMMING IN YOUR BOX.
JAM'N IN YOUR BOX.
Reporter: WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THAT SUCK?
WYATT
