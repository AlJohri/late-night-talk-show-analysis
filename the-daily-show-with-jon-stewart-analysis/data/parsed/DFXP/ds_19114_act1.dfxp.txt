FROM COMEDY CENTRALS WORLD NEWS HEAD QUATERS IN NY THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART!
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT! OUR PROGRAM TONIGHT, LET ME TELL YOU THIS, OUR PROGRAM TONIGHT IS VERY SPECIAL, SPECTACULAR. FIRST OF ALL, FROM THE NEW FILM "EDGE OF TOMORROW," WE HAVE A TALENTED YOUNG ACTOR NAME OF THOMAS CRUISE! THOMAS CRUISE. I BELIEVE HE GOES BY TOM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE'LL BE JOINING US IN A LITTLE BIT. BUT BEFORE THAT, TONIGHT I WANT TO BEGIN WITH GUNS. (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) ALRIGHT. THIS MAY BE A BIT OF AN UPHILL SLOG. LET'S BEGIN WITH GUNS. BECAUSE THIS IS AMERICA, AND EVERYTHING BEGINS -- AND SOMETIMES ENDS -- WITH GUNS.
WALKING IN TO A CONVENIENCE STORE WITH A RIFLE, ORDERING A LATTE WITH A LONG GUN. IT'S ALL PART OF A PROTEST BY THE GROUP OPEN CARRY TEXAS. THEY ADVOCATE FOR GUN RIGHTS WITH AN IN-YOUR-FACE STYLE THAT IS PERFECTLY LEGAL IN THE LONE STAR STATE.
I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU HOW TO GET A SLURPEE WITH AN AK-47. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND THEN AFTER THAT A SLIGHTLY USED BMW WITH THE CAR ALREADY RUNNING AND THE DRIVER ALREADY IN IT. NOW OBVIOUSLY, THE GENTLEMAN ISN'T ROBBING THE 7-11 -- BY THE WAY, OBVIOUS TO US IN HINDSIGHT (LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS, WORKING THE OVERNIGHT AT 7-11 ISN'T ALREADY (BLEEP) ENOUGH THAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EMPTYING OUT WHATEVER IT IS THAT COAGULATES UNDER THE ROLLING HOT DOG TRAY AND CARDING SMOKERS, NOW YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH AN AK CARRYING CONSTITUTION ABSOLUTEST PERFORMANCE ARTIST IN A TRILBY, WHICH IS A HAT THAT SOMEHOW COMBINES THE DOUCHEY-EST PART OF FEDORA AND A PORK THIGH. ANYWAY -- (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) AND THIS GUNSPLOSION IS HAPPENING AT ESTABLISHMENTS ALL ACROSS THE LONE STAR STATE.
LAST MONTH, A LOCAL CHAPTER OF THE GUN RIGHTS ADVOCACY GROUP OPEN CARRY TEXAS TRIED TO EAT A MEAL AT THIS CHILI'S WHILE CARRYING THEIR WEAPONS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW DID THE PATRONS RESPOND? THEY'RE AT A CHILI'S, SO OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT THAT CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR HEALTH. BUT ARE THEY PREPARED TO DEAL WITH LETHAL THREATS THAT AREN'T SMOTHERED IN CHEESE, PORK AND RANCH DRESSING? PORK CHACHOS! WE SHOVED A WHEEL OF GOUDA UP A PIG'S ASS, FRIED IT IN MAYONAISE AND DROPPED IT OFF A ROOF INTO A COMPOST HEAP OF OLD POTATOES. PORKCHACHOS. DO YA FEEL LUCKY, PUNK?
WE'RE HAPPY TO SEAT YOU AND FEED YOU, YOU JUST HAVE TO LEAVE YOUR FIREARMS OUTSIDE.
AT LEAST ONE PATRON BECAME UPSET.
THERE'S CHILDREN HERE AND YOU'RE A DUMB ASS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I THINK SHE'S INTO YOU! GET HER DIGITS. THE POINT IS, THESE OPEN CARRY DEMONSTRATIONS DREW A LOT OF ATTENTION, INCLUDE FROM THE OPEN CARRY DEATH STAR ITSELF THE N.R.A.
THE NATION'S MOST VOCAL GUN ADVOCACY GROUP CONDEMNED THE ACTIVISTS SAYING USING GUNS MERELY TO DRAW ATTENTION TO YOURSELF IN PUBLIC NOT ONLY DEFIES COMMON SENSE, IT SHOWS A LACK OF CONSIDERATION AND MANNERS.
Jon: ONCE AGAIN, THE N.R.A. BLINDLY -- WAIT WHAT? THAT SOUNDED VAGUELY REASONABLE! (LAUGHTER) WILL OPEN CARRY LISTEN?
ON MONDAY, OPEN CARRY TEXAS THREATENED TO WITHDRAW ITS SUPPORT FOR THE N.R.A. AND, TO UNDERSCORE THAT POINT, IT POSTED A PHOTO OF AN N.R.A. MEMBERSHIP CARD CUT UP.
Jon: OPEN CARRY, I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU HOW TO DO YOUR BUSINESS, BUT YOU'RE SITTING ON A BUNKER FULL OF ASSAULT RIFLES AND YOU USE SCISSORS? THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SHOULDN'T THAT NRA CARD HAVE A  HOLE THROUGH IT SOMEWHERE? WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF SYMBOLISM PLEASE? WELL, GUESS WHAT, BUDDIES? IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU INSTAGRAMED YOUR LITTER TO THE N.R.A. -- IT'S IS THE N.R.A.! THEY STAND THEIR GROUND!
THE TRUTH IS AN ALERT WENT OUT THAT REFERRED TO THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR AS WEIRD OR SOMEHOW NOT NORMAL, AND THAT WAS A MISTAKE. IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. THE TRUTH IS -- AND I'LL BE CRYSTAL CLEAR -- THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS OPEN CARRY.
Jon: WOW. EVERYONE IS SCARED OF GUN NUTS. EVEN OTHER GUN NUTS. (LAUGHTER) GUN NUTS -- THAT'S FUNNY! GUN NUTS ARE FUNNY! (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) WHAT IF YOU GOT GUN NUTS FOR A NEW GUN? (LAUGHTER) YEAH, AS THEY GET OLDER -- WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW, THE ONE GROUP THAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM IN THIS SCENARIO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WITNESS THESE OPEN CARRY DEMONSTRATIONS, HOW DO THEY FEEL?
IT SCARED ME JUST SEEING THEM OUT THERE. THEY HAVE GUNS. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY KNOW HOW TO USE IT. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE BAD INTENTIONS.
Jon: THAT IS A GOOD POINT. YOU AS AN OPEN CARRY GUY MAY KNOW YOU'RE A GOOD GUY WITH A GUN, BUT MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL EVERYBODY ELSE ASSOCIATION, THEY HAVE NO IDEA. KIND OF WHY THE POLICE WEAR UNIFORMS. SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO SPEND THEIR ENTIRE DAY GOING, "EVERYBODY IT'S OK! I'M A GOOD GUY! STOP RUNNING!" (LAUGHTER) SO WHEN YOU GO INTO THESE PLACES OPEN CARRYING, CLEARLY OTHER PEOPLE FEEL THREATENED. WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO?
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE ALARMED, AND THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN FEELINGS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND, SO, WE HAVE ARRIVED AT OUR DESTINATION. WHERE THE N.R.A. HAS PUT US IN SOMEWHAT OF A QUANDARY, A CONUNDRUM, A PICKLE. BY THE WAY, TRY TO PICKLE CONUNDRUMS AND CHILES, THEY TAKE ALL THE PORKCHACHOS YOU DIDN'T EAT SOAK THEM IN CHEESE BRINE, SEDATE YOU AND FORCE THE MIXTURE THROUGH A CATHETER IN YOUR PEE HOLE (LAUGHTER) IT'S CALLED THE DEVIL'S APPETIZER AND IT'S $4.95! ARBY'S, YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THE N.R.A. HERE'S WHERE WE ARE, THE N.R.A. AND THE OPEN CARRY FOLKS SUPPORT THE RIGHT TO CARRY WEAPONS WHEREVER YOU WANT, EVEN IF THOSE WEAPONS ARE GOING TO TERRIFY EVERYONE AROUND YOU. HERE'S WHAT ELSE THEY SUPPORT.
THE ONLY THING THAT STOPS A BAD GUY WITH A GUN IS A GOOD GUY WITH A GUN.
Jon: SEE WHERE WE ARE?  WE HAVE A MEXICAN STANDOFF HERE. WELL, A TEX-MEXICAN REALLY. WE ARE AT THE INTERSECTION OF OPEN CARRY ROAD AND STAND YOUR GROUND PLACE. HERE'S WHERE WE ARE.
THIS IS LEGAL. IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS, YOU CAN. IF YOU DON'T USE YOUR RIGHTS, YOU'LL LOSE THEM.
IT SCARES PEOPLE TO SEE A BUNCH OF GUYS WITH HUGE GUNS.
STAND YOUR GROUND. WHAT THAT LAW SAYS IS IF YOU'RE ACTING IN REASONABLE BELIEF OF FEAR OF GREAT BODILY INJURY OR DEATH, THEN YOU'RE ALLOWED TO RESPOND TO THAT WITH DEADLY FORCE.
THIS DUTY TO RETREAT MAY SOUND FINE IN AN IVY LEAGUE COCKTAIL PARTY, BUT IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL IN THE REAL WORLD OF CRIME VICTIMS. SO WHAT THE (BLEEP) ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO NOW! ACCORDING TO THE N.R.A.'S BASIC PRINCIPLES, YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO CARRY A WEAPON THAT MAY CAUSE A REASONABLE PERSON TO BELIEVE THEY ARE IN DANGER OF GREAT BODILY INJURY, AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT, IF THEY FEEL THAT WAY, TO RESPOND WITH DEADLY FORCE! IT'S A PERPETUAL VIOLENCE MACHINE! IT'S GUN FIGHT AT THE GOLDEN CORRAL! WAIT A MINUTE... THIS ISN'T AN ARGUMENT ABOUT FREEDOM AT ALL, IS IT? THIS WHOLE THING'S A [BEEP] BUSINESS PLAN FOR ARMS DEALERS! SON OF A -- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
