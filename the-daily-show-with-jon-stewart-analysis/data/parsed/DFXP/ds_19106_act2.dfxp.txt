(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK! THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, MIDTERM ELECTIONS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER, CONGRESS'S APPROVAL RATING IS IN THE TWEENS. IT'S TIME ONCE AGAIN TO RAISE A CRY OF "THROW THE BUMS OUT." AND THEN RE-ELECT 90% OF SAID BUMS. HOW DO THESE GUYS KEEP GETTING RE-ELECTED TERM AFTER TERM? WELL, LET'S TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN CHARLIE RANGEL, 83 YEARS OLD AND 43 YEARS IN OFFICE, CENSURED BY CONGRESS IN 2010 AFTER A PHOTO OF HIM ASLEEP IN FRONT OF HIS DOMINICAN VILLA ON WHICH HE FAILED TO PAY TAXES BECAME THE SYMBOL OF HIS EXTENSIVE FINANCIAL MALFEASANCE. HERE'S HOW CONFIDENT HE WAS IN BEING RELECTED ANYWAY.  HE USED THAT PHOTO AS HIS CAMPAIGN POSTER. THAT'S WHAT HE DID. HE DOESN'T CARE. THIS YEAR CHARLIE RANGEL IS LOCKED IN A TIGHT PRIMARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST STATE SENATOR ADRIANO ESPAILLAT AND REVEREND MICHAEL WALROND WHO ARE DETERMINED TO TAKE THIS GUY DOWN IN A MAJOR DEBATE LAST NIGHT. WHAT COULD RANGEL DO TO COME OUT A WINNER? CHECK YOUR POCKETS MACGYVER, BECAUSE THE CLOCK IS TICKING AND HE'S GOT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING.
I UNDERSTAND I ONLY HAVE THREE MINUTES AND, JUST ONE MINUTE (ANSWERS BLACKBERY) NO I'M THE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DEBATE. YES, NO IT'S FOR UNITED STATES CONGRESS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, THAT WAS QUITE THE MYSTERY RING ON HIS PHONE. EITHER HE HAD TO TAKE A VERY IMPORTANT CALL FROM HIS UROLOGIST DURING THE DEBATE OR HE'S ABOUT TO LAUNCH INTO A BIT. YES, IN THE GREATEST DEBATE TACTIC SINCE LINCOLN ASKED DOUGLAS, "WHOREMONGER SAYS WHAT?" CHARLIE RANGEL DID HIS ENTIRE OPENING STATEMENT IN THE FORM OF A GAG  PHONE CALL WITH SOMEONE WHO JUST HAPPENED TO WANT TO KNOW REALLY TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT THE TWO OTHER CANDIDATES SITTING NEXT TO HIM.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S BEEN HERE 18 YEARS BUT HE DIDN'T SAY HE PASSED ANY BILLS AT ALL. WELL THE GUY WAS ONLY THERE HALF OF THE TIME. (RANGEL ON PHONE) LISTEN, HOW CAN HE REGISTER TO VOTE IN NEW YORK WHEN HE LIVES IN JERSEY?
Jon: NO, I'M AS CONFUSED ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE, PERSON I MADE UP! YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK THIS IS HOW CHARLIE RANGEL STAYS IN OFFICE SO LONG. YES, HE'S CORRUPT BUT HE'S VERY LIKABLE. I MEAN, HE FIGURED OUT HOW TO BE A TOTAL DICK TO THE GUYS SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM, WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAID DICKISHNESS.
THEY LOVE HIM AT THE, HE'S VERY ACTIVE AT THE NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK AND THEY LIKE HIM. THEY HAVEN'T ENDORSED HIM, OF COURSE NOT.
WHY DIDN'T THEY ENDORSE HIM? I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE HE KILLED SOMEONE. THAT I KNOW OF. I MEAN, EVEN IF HE HAD I'M SURE HE WOULD DISPOSE THE BODY IN A TRADITIONAL -- CANNIBALISM? NO. I DON'T THINK SO. WHAT -- I DON'T KNOW. NO WONDER HE'S STILL IN CONGRESS. IN FACT, THERE MAY BE NO WAY AT ALL TO GET THESE AGING INCUMBENTS OUT OF OFFICE.
CONGRESSMAN JOHN CONYERS EXPECTED TO RUN FOR HIS 26TH TERM IN NOVEMBER IS BEING KEPT OFF THE BALLOT IN THE PRIMARY BECAUSE OF INVALID SIGNATURES ON A PETITION.
Jon: WOW, SO WITHOUT TERM LIMITS, WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL CONGRESS PEOPLE GET SO OLD THEYLOSE SIGNATURES LIKE KEYS. HOW DOES THE CONSTITUTION EVEN ALLOW FOR THIS TYPE OF ENTRENCHED INCUMBENCY? RING, RING. HELLO? WHAT'S THAT? FOUNDING FATHER JAMES MADISON! WHAT? YOU NEVER INTENDED FOR ANYONE TO SERVE THAT LONG IN CONGRESS? WELL, OH, WHEN YOU WERE DRAFTING THE CONSTITUTION, LIFE EXPECTY WAS 48. I SEE. AND HOW ARE YOU CALLING ME FROM BEYOND THE -- REALLY? HEAVEN IS FOR REAL! AND IT'S ALL JUST (BLEEP). ALRIGHT. WELL,  YEAH. NO, HE DIDN'T MENTION THAT. SEPARATE SECTION. ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S NICE.
