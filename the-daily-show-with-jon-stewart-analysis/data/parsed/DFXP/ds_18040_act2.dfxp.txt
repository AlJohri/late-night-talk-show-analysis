[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. I APOLOGIZE FOR MY VOICE. A LITTLE COLD. WE'VE LEARNED IN OUR  CONVERSATION ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S  STAGERING NUMBER OF GUN RELATED DEATHS BUT IT'S BASED ON A  SURPRISING AMOUNT OF NONE  NON-GUN FACTORS. GOD, IMMEDIATE WHY AND CRAZY  PEOPLE. THAT'S A BUSY GRAPHIC. CAN BE STREAMLINE THAT AND  REPRESENT ALL THREE  STITTENCECIES? THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO SAY THIS  CONVERSATION IS TAKING PLACE  BETWEEN PARTIES GOVERNOR FAITH AND THAT ALL OF US ON ANY SIDE  OF THE DEBATE ARE ANTI-MASSACRE. IF COMMON SENSE FIREARM  REGULATIONS MIGHT CUT THE NUMBER  OF THESE KILLINGS, WHY NOT TRY?
WE HAVE MANY, MANY LAWS  PERTAINING TO GUNS ALREADY.
WE HAVE LAWS BANNING MURDER  BUT WE STILL HAVE MURDERS.
DRUNK DRIVING DO WE GO TO THE  FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND TELL THEM  STOP MAKING AUTOMOBILES BECAUSE PEOPLE GET DRUNK AND KILL PEOPLE  IN CARS?
Jon: SO WE DO CHARGE  BARTENDERS WHO SERVE DRUNKS, AND  LAUNCH PUBLIC AWARANCE CAMPAIGNS AND HAVE TOUGHER DRUNK DRIVING  LAWS BECAUSE IT MIGHT JUST BRING  DRUNK DRIVING RATES DOWN BY -- I DON'T KNOW -- TWO THIRDS IN A  FEW DECADES. LIKE MAGAZINE SIZES SMALLER  MAGAZINES FOR GUNS. MAKE THEM HAVE TO RELOAD MORE.
CAN I DO THAT PRETTY QUICK.
Jon: YOU ARE FAST FINGERS  GRAHAM THE FOREMOST GUN  ENTHUSIAST SLASH SPEED OR GAMY  CHAMPION? THE WORLD. HOW HE USES HIS GUN HANDS TO  MAKE SUCH DELEGATE PAPER ART. WHY IT'S A MYSTERY. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. MAGAZINE RESTRICTIONS WON'T  HELP. HOW ABOUT WE KEEP ALL THE GUNS  EXCEPT WEAPONS DESIGNED PURELY  TO GO AFTER ENEMY SOLDIERS.
WE'VE HAD A SO CALLED ASSAULT  WEAPONS BAN FOR TEN YEARS. STUDIES SAID IT MADE NO  DIFFERENCE. IT WAS ILL CONCEIVE AND IT  DIDN'T WORK PROPERLY.
Joe: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY  SAY, IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T  SUCCEED (bleep) IT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR MAGIC,  FLYING SOLVING PROJECTILE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A SERIES OF  STEPS FROM DIFFERENT AREAS THAT  COULD IMPROVE THE SITUATION AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE HAVE NOW  WHICH IS LEGISLATION RIDERS THAT  PREVENT THE ATF FROM CHECKING INVENTORIES AND BILLS MAKING IT  HARDER WON'T GET DO NOT BUY LIST  AND LAWS FOR -- PEOPLE GOD FORBID McDONALDS DOESN'T TELL  YOU HOW HOT THEIR HOT STEAMY  COFFEE IS. THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE TAKING  THE MONEY TRAIN TO McPUNITIVE  DAMAGE TOWN. AN EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE. OUR HANDS ARE TIED. WE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING. WE ARE A NATION OF OVER REACTORS  TO EVERYTHING. WE HAVE STEP-BY-STEP CHILD  PROOFED THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY. 20 YEARS AGO A GUY THROUGH A  ROCK OVER AN OVERPASS AND HIT A  CAR WINDSHIELD AND NOW EVERY OVERPASS IS BLOCKED. THERE'S A NET OVER THE GOALPOST. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS? MAKE GUNS LESS SEXY SO THEY  WOULDN'T BE SO COOL. THE NEXT JASON BORNE MOVIE STARS  WOODY ALLEN. NOT REALLY A GUN PERSON. NOT SO MUCH THE KILLING BUT THE  LOOGD AND THE CLEANING. IT'S A LOT OF WORK. [ LAUGHTER ] OR EVEN BETTER CREATIVE SOUND  EDITING TO TAKE AWAY THE COOL  GUN FACTOR. [SIRENS] SEE. THOSE SILLY SOUND EFFECTS  COMPLETELY STOPPED BY DESIRE TO  GET CAUGHT IN A BLOODY THREE-WAY MEXICAN STANDOFF. WE WOULD LOVE TO YOUR IDEAS. THERE ARE NO BAD IDEAS. I REFUSE TO PLAY THE GAME OF YOU  IS ASSAULT WEAPON. IT'S A HAMMER. AN ARTICLE CL CAME OUT THIS WEEK  OF A MASSIVE NUMBER KILLED WELL  HAMMERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OKAY. IF YOU WANT TO REGULATE HAMMERS,  WE COULD TRY THAT. WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO REGULATE  BAGS OF HAMMERS OR ANYONE AS  DUMB AS THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT ASIDE FROM HAMMER CONTROL  WHICH, BY THE WAY, WAS A GREAT  MC HAMMER ALBUM, DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER IDEA TREERS -- IDEAS FOR  REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE?
THE ONLY THING THAT STOPS A  BAD GUY WITH IS A GUN S, IS A  GOOD GUY WITH A GUN.
Jon: SO A SCHOOL PRINCIPAL  WITH A GUN IS GOING TO STOP A  GUY WITH A BULLET PROOF VEST AND A GUN. I DON'T THINK PRINCIPAL BELDEN  IS AS BAD ASS AS WE THINK. IT'S WEIRD TO ME THAT GUN  ENTHUSIASTS WON'T EVEN ENTERTAIN  THE IDEA -- LET ME RESTATE THAT SOME WON'T ENTERTAIN SOME MOVES  TO REIN IN THIS VIOLENCE. WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON HERE?
WE HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL  FREEDOM THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS IN THIS COUNTRY.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH FOR A WELL  REGULATED MILITIA. NOT A PERSONAL ARSENAL FREE FOR  ALL. THERE'S ALL SORTS OF THINGS YOU  CAN'T HAVE ALREADY. TANKS, F-16 FIGHTER JETS,  SURFACE TO AIR ANYTHING. PEOPLE HAD MUSKETS THEN. SO, OKAY, YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE  MUSS CETZ YOU WANT. YOU CAN EVEN -- MUSKETS YOU  WANT. YOU CAN HAVE ASSAULT MUSKETS FOR  ALL I CARE. JAZZ IT WITH A BAYONET. GO (bleep) NUTS. WHY IS IT THAT WE'RE UNABLE TO  MAKE THE MOST BASIC STEPS  TOWARDS PUTTING TOGETHER A COMPLEX PLAN OF ACTION TO SLOW  THIS SPREAD. WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON HERE?
I THINK YOU, LIKE A LOT OF  PEOPLE, JOSHUA, ARE WORRIED THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS COMING AFTER OUR GUNS.
Jon: NOW WE'RE GETTING  SOMEWHERE. IT'S ABOUT HOW CLOSE SOME PEOPLE  IN THIS COUNTRY FEEL THEY ARE  LIVING TO A TYRANT'S RULE.
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE SEEN  HAPPEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN  HISTORY WITH STALIN. HAPPENED IN CAMBODIA AND OF  COURSE THE THIRD REICH, COMING. NO ONE SAUL THAT.
STALIN TOOK THE GUNS, FIDEL  CASTRO TOOK THE GUNS. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU 1776 WILL  COMMENCE AGAIN IF YOU TRY TO  TAKE OUR FIREARMS! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OH (bleep). NO ONE IS TAKING AWAY ALL THE  GUNS. BUT NOW I GET IT. NOW I SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. THIS IS WHAT IT IS. THEIR PARANOID FEAR OF A  POSSIBLE DISTOPPIC FUTURE  PREVENTS US FROM ADDRESSING OUR ACTUAL DYSTOPIC PRESENCE. WE  CAN'T DISCUSS THE GUN DEATHS  HAPPENING IN REALITY EVERY YEAR  BECAUSE A FEW OF US MUST REMAIN VIGILANT AGAINST THE RISE OF
