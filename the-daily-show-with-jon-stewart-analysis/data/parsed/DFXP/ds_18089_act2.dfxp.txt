( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. WELCOME BACK. IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE CREDIT  WHERE CREDIT IS DUE. THIS PAST WEEK NO ONE HAS BEEN  MORE DESERVING THAN NBC. PETE WILLIAMS DID A GREAT JOB  WHEN HE WAS COVERING THIS TERROR  ATTACK. BRIAN WILLIAMS DID A GREAT JOB. SERENA WILLIAMS, I THOUGHT, WAS  VERY GOOD. ROBIN WILLIAMS, WILL I AM,  EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE NBC  WILLIAMS' FAMILY. OF COURSE, THERE WERE THE  OCCASIONAL NEWS SLIP-UPS. YOUR NEW YORK POST. MIGHT HAVE MISIDENTIFIED TWO  HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AT  TERRORISTS AND PUT THEM ON THE COVER OF THEIR NEWSPAPER. BUT, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY A PAPER  RUN BY ACCURACY AFICIONADO  RUPERT MURDOCH WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE QUICK TO CORRECT SUCH AN  EGREGIOUS MISTAKE.
RUPERT MURDOCH THE OWNER OF  THE NEW YORK POST HAS NOT  APOLOGIZED. IN FACT HE SAID ON TWITTER AND  I'LL READ IT. ONLY NEW YORK POST PICTURES WERE  THOSE DISTRIBUTED BY F.B.I. AND  INSTANTLY DRAWN WHEN F.B.I. CHANGED DIRECTION.
Jon: WHY WOULDN'T RUPERT  MURDOCH APOLOGIZE FOR  ENDANGERING TWO TOTALLY INNOCENT YOUNG MEN? IS IT PERHAPS THAT YEARS AGO HE  PURCHASED AND HAD INSTALLED ALL  OF HITLER'S INTERNAL ORGANS? OF COURSE EVERYONE HAD A LITTLE  FUN AT CNN'S EXPENSE FOR THEIR  MONSTER GAFFE WHEN THEY CLAIMED AN ARREST HAD BEEN MADE IN THE  CASE AND THERE WAS NONE. THEY TOOK EXTRA CARE NOT TO  MISREPORT AGAIN.
OF COURSE WE HAVE NO IDEA ON  THE MOTIVATION. WE HAVE TO EMPHASIZE THAT AGAIN  AND AGAIN AND AGAIN BECAUSE AT  THIS POINT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO  IDEA.
DID THE POLICE GIVE YOU ANY  INDICATION OF WHAT KIND OF  ACTIVITY IS GOING ON?
THEY'RE NOT. NO. THEY'RE NOT GIVING US ANY SENSE  OF WHAT'S GOING ON.
IT'S JUST ODD. WE DON'T KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENED.
THIS IS A LOT OF FIRSTS GOING  ON. NOT EVERY MOVEMENT MEANS THAT  SOMETHING MEANINGFUL IS  HAPPENING.
Jon: SEE? IS THAT SO HARD? WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE? [BLEEP]. MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE WAY OF  BROADCASTING THAN YOUR USUAL SAY  IT FIRST AND HAVE ANDERSON COOPER CORRECT IT LATER. AT LEAST THEY'RE TRYING  SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT. WHILE ALL THE OTHER NETWORKS  CHOSE TO HAVE AN ANCHOR IN THE  STUDIO THAT KEPT THE KAY ON THETIC COVERAGE FROM GOING  ADRIFT. CNN WENT MORE WITH YOUR SAND LOT  FOOTBALL. EVERYONE GO LONG! FORCING THEIR REPORTERS TO LET  THE CONTROL ROOM KNOW WHEN THEY  WERE OPEN FOR AN ON-CAMERA PASS.
GUYS, YOU GOT TO COME TO US. LISTEN, OKAY. A HUGE... JAKE, JAKE, JAKE,  JOHN.
Jon: I THINK THE LADY ON  CAMERA FOUR AS TO PEE. LET'S GO TO HER LIVE AND FIND  OUT. CAMERA FOUR. I'M KIDDING. IT MUST HAVE BEEN BIG NEWS TO  BREAK. WHAT WAS THE BIG NEWS?
JAKE, JAKE, JAKE, JOHN, A  HUGE CARAVAN OF CARS. WE CAN SMELL SMOKE RIGHT NOW. THERE'S A HELICOPTER UP IN THE  AIR. THE SMELL OF SMOKE IS IN THE  AIR. IT'S DEFINITE. THERE'S A HUGE PRESENCE HERE. LOOK AT ALL THESE CARS THAT ARE  COMING. SOMETHING JUST HAPPENED. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
Jon: YOU'RE FLAGGING DOWN THE  CAMERAMAN. IT TURNS OUT IT'S P. DIDDY AND  HIS ENTOURAGE. I APOLOGIZE BUT THE UP TO THE  MINUTE COVERAGE.
A COUPLE OF CARS ARE NOW  BEGINNING TO MOVE.
CARS GOING STRAIGHT. YOU'VE GOT CARS PEEL TO GO THE  RIGHT. A NUMBER OF VEHICLES JUST PULLED  OUT. WE HEAR ONE OF THE CANINE DOGS  BARKING. INTERESTING. THAT DOG IS BARKING.
WE CAN SMELL... THERE WAS  SOMETHING IN THE AIR.
THAT'S AT LEAST A THIRD  CANINE DOG. AGAIN BARKING. BARKING VERY, VERY LOUDLY. THEY MAY BE SMELLING WHAT WE  THOUGHT WE SMELLED.
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU  SOMETHING WITH CANINE DOGS. I GOT ONE OF THEM. THEY BARK A LOT. SOMETIMES THEY'LL JUST [BLEEP] STARE OUT THE WINDOW AND BARK  EVEN WHEN THERE'S NOTHING OUT  THERE. SOMETIMES HE LICKS HIS OWN  GENITALS, YOU KNOW. YOU CAN'T ALWAYS READ A LOT INTO  WHAT THEY DO. NEWSWISE. BUT IF THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN  SAY FOR THIS NETWORK, THEY WERE  THERE.
YOU CAN HEAR THIS OFFICER. THIS OFFICER IS NOW CLEARING  PEOPLE EVEN FARTHER FROM NORFOLK  STREET.
GET OUT OF THE WAY, PLEASE. WE ARE ALSO BEING TOLD TO  STAND BACK BECAUSE WE'RE BEING  MOVED RIGHT NOW. OFFICER, WHAT'S GOING ON?
I DON'T KNOW BUT I NEED YOU  ACROSS THE STREET TO KEEP YOU  SAFE.
WE SNAKE THROUGH ALLEYS AND  BACKYARDS TO GET TO A COUPLE OF  HUNDRED OF YARDS NEAR THE BOAT. POLICE RUSHED US SAYING WE WERE  IN THE CROSS FIRE ZONE.
CLEAR OUT. PLEASE. SNIEM WHAT A GREAT USE OF POLICE  RESOURCES, RUSHING THE CAMERA  CREW. NOT SURE THE SEARCH FOR THE  DANGEROUS TERRORIST IS THE BEST  TIME TO SAY SCREW THE COPS. EVEN THE TMZ GUY WOULD BE LIKE [BLEEP] LET THEM DO THEIR JOBS. IT WAS A NOBLE EFFORT. YOU KNOW, KEEP GOING. IT WILL GET BETTER. ANY FINAL THOUGHTS?
BEING IN WATERTOWN RIGHT NOW,  THE STREETS ARE EMPTY. IT'S ERIE. IT'S AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD  DROPPED SOMEWHERE.
Jon: YES, IT DOES SEEM LIKE  THAT SOMETIMES. IT'S NOT SO MUCH A METAPHOR AS,  WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
