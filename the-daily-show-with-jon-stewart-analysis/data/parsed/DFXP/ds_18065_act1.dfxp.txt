FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. JOURNALIST STEPHEN BRISM HE IS  THE AUTHOR OF ATIME MAGAZINE  COVER STORY ON WHAT SAILING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IT TURNS OUT OUR HEALTH CARE  SYSTEM HAS PRICE CANCER AND NO  INSURANCE. [LAUGHTER] WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS WEEK  ON THE PROGRAM HOW REPUBLICANS  LED BY SENATORS LINDSEY GRAHAM AND SALTY McCAIN ARE HOLDING  UP THE NOMINEES FOR THE DEFENSE  AND C.I.A. UNTIL THE SENATORS GET THE INFORMATION ON WHAT  HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI INCLUDING  WHO CHANGED THE TALKING POINTS SUSAN RICE USED ON THE SUNDAY  MORNING SHOWS SO WE CAN BE SURE  NO AMERICANS ARE HARMED AGAIN BY THE TALKING POINTS.
WHATEVER WAS SAID BASED ON  INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE  INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ON A SERIES OF SUNDAY SHOWS BEARS NO  RELEVANCE ON THE ULTIMATE  QUESTIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN  BENGHAZI. THERE'S AN OBVIOUS POLITICAL  OBSESSION OVER A SERIES OF TALK  POINTS THAT AGAIN BEARS NO RELEVANCE ON THE ESSENTIAL  ISSUES HERE.
JUST A LOT OF PAUSES. VERY QUICKLY. THEY ARE NOT IMPORTANT. THEY ARE NOT RELEVANT. THEY ARE NOT GERMANE. YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM ANYWAY BUT  LATELY THERE'S AN INTERESTING  TWIST. SOME DEMOCRATS APPARENTLY  DECIDING -- DEMOCRATS DECIDING  THAT WHAT IS -- WHAT IS THE PHRASE I'M LOOKING FOR?
WHAT IS SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE  IS NOW SAUCE FOR THE GANDER.
Jon: NO, NO, THAT'S NOT IT. I'M THINKING OF THE OTHER  POULTRY BASED EXPRESSION.
KEEP (bleep) THAT CHICKEN.
Jon: KEEP (bleep) THAT  CHICKEN. THAT'S THE ONE. [LAUGHTER] DEMOCRATS SAW REPUBLICANS  (bleep) THAT CHICKEN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY THOUGHT I WANT TO GET  ME SOME OF THAT.
IT'S SOME IN THE PRESIDENT'S  OWN PARTY THAT ARE THREATENING  TO HOLD UP BRENNAN'S NOMINATION. OREGON SENATOR RON WYDEN TELLING  REPORTERS HE WOULD PULL OUT ALL  THE STOPS TO GET ANSWERS ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF AMERICANS  TARGETED BY AL QAEDA OVERSEAS.
Jon: OOOH THE SENATOR FROM  OREGON IS GOING TO PULL OUT ALL  THE STOPS. SOMEONE IS GOING GET A LETTER ON  ARTISNAL HEMP -- DAM YOU SOY  INK. FREE RANGE PENS? WHAT ARE THEY SAYING TO THE  PRESIDENT.
THEY'VE WRITTEN SAY FUG DON'T  SHARE WITH US SOME OF THE LEGAL  MEMOS DRAFTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TOLL VALID DATE THE  DRONE KILLING OF AMERICAN  CITIZENS OVERSEAS WE'RE GOING TO MAKE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT FOR  JOHN BRENNAN.
Jon: THAT'S A WISEGUY LIKE. NICE NOMINEE YOU GOT THERE BE A  SHAME IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO  HIM, MR. PRESIDENT. THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO  REMIND DEMOCRATS THAT THE  PRESIDENT HAS A DRONE PROGRAM WITH AMBIGUOUS RESTRAINTS AND  MURKY LEGAL JUSTIFICATION. THIS IS ALL FOR NAUGHT. I'M SURE HE WILL SHARE THE DRONE  E-MAILS. HE PRETTY MUCH SAID SO A WEEK  AND A HALF AGO.
IN THE MONTHS AHEAD I'LL  CONTINUE TO ENGAGE CONGRESS TO  ENSURE NOT ONLY THAT OUR TARGETING, DETENTION AND  PROSECUTION OF TERRORISTS  REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH OUR LAWS AND SYSTEM OF CHECK AND BALANCES  BUT THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE MORE  TRANSPARENT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TO THE WORLD.
Jon: STARTING WITH OUR  NUCLEAR CODES. 4-13-8 -- NOW, SOME AMERICANS  WANT TO CHANGE THE CODES. HE WILL BE ASKED THE SECURITY  QUESTION WHAT HOSPITAL WERE YOU  BORN IN? IT'S ME AND THE ANSWER, OF  COURSE, NAIROBI MEMORIAL. WAIT, HOLD ON! SO -- THE REPUBLICANS WANT  INFORMATION ON THE BENGHAZI  ATTACK WHICH THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IS POINTLESS. THE DEMOCRAT S WAN TO KNOW THE  LEGAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THE  DRONE KILLING WHICH THE PRESIDENT SAYS IS TOTALLY  LEGITIMATE. IT'S CLEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS  GOING TO DO NEXT.
THE NORKTS REPORTS THE --  "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTS THEY  ARE COOPERATING. RATHER THAN AGREEING WITH  DEMOCRATS TO RELEASE CLASSIFIED  INFORMATION ON THE LEGAL JUST FICTIONS INVOLVED IN THE  TARGETED KILLING DRONE PROGRAM.
Jon: WHAT? DO YOU REMEMBER THE STATE OF THE  UNION WITH THE PROMISE OF  TRANSPARENCY ON THE DRONES. THE STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH  PROMISES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE  SLIGHTLY MORE DURABLE THAN NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS. IT'S BEEN TEN DAYS, MY MAN. I WAS ON ATKINS AFTER JANUARY 1  FOR 12 DAYS. COME ON. I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED. THERE WAS THE TELLTALE CUTAWAY  AS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT  TRANSPARENCY DURING THE STATE OF THE UNION.
THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE MORE  TRANSPARENT TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE AND TO THE WORLD. [  APPLAUSE  ] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: EVEN OBAMA THOUGHT  THAT SENTENCE WAS (bleep). [LAUGHTER] BY THE MAIN QUESTION THIS RAISES  IS:  WHAT IS IN THOSE DRONE  MEMOS THAT IS SO TERRIBLE THE WHITE HOUSE WILL GIVE ANYTHING  INCLUDING INFORMATION PREVIOUSLY  NOT SEEN ABOUT THE BENGHAZI ATTACKS NOT TO HAVE TO RELEASE  THEM? THE MORE WE GO TO SENIOR  INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT ASSIF  MANDVI IN WASHINGTON. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I UNDERSTAND, ASSIF, IF I'M NOT  MISTAKEN, YOU HAVE OBTAINED A  COPY OF DRONE MEMOS.
WHAT? UM --
Jon: ARE THOSE THE DRONE  MEMOS RIGHT THERE ASSIF?
RIGHT WHERE? WHERE?
Jon: IN YOUR HAND. YOU GOT THE --
NO, NO, NO MEMOS. NEVER SAW ANY MEMOS, JON. I SAW THEM OH, MY GOD.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING  UP FOR? WHAT IS THE UP THERE? WHAT IS THE PROBLEM, WHAT ARE  YOU LOOKING UP FOR?
NOT ANY WHITE HOUSE  AUTHORIZED DOMESTIC DEATH  DRONES. THAT'S FOR SURE.
Jon: IS THAT A BULLET-PROOF  VEST. THERE ARE DRONES HERE IN AMERICA  FLYING -- WAIT SHALL WHAT?
I WOULD KNOW NOTHING ABOUT  THAT. SO THERE WOULD BE NO POINT IN  TAKING ME OUT BECAUSE I DID NOT  SEE THE MEMOS. OH, MY GOD I SAW THEM, JON. HOLY (bleep) I SAW THEM!
Jon: ARE NAMES NAMED? IS THERE A KILL LIST? IS IT FUNDED BY FRIENDS OF  HAMAS?
SORRY, JON. IT'S GETTING COLD HERE. ARE YOU COLD?
Jon: OH, YES, DID THE MEMOS  DESCRIBE HOW THE PRESIDENT GETS  JUSTIFICATION FOR THE DRONE STRIKES, THE PROCESS THROUGH  WHICH THE DRONE STRIKES ARE  VETTED?
IT'S WARMING UP A LITTLE BIT.
Jon: YES, YES IT'S A  MEMO -- IS IT LIKE A OH, BIDE  SEASON A CYBORG KILLING MACHINE?
NO, NO A COLD BREEZE JUST  CAME THROUGH JON, SO --
Jon: OKAY, OKAY. SO IT'S LIKE SECRET COURTS AND  STUFF, YEAH?
PLEASE, LISTEN TO ME, OKAY? IF YOU THINK THAT THE MEMO  STATES THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA FROM  HIS DESK CAN CURRENTLY OPERATE DRONES TO KILL ANY ONE ANYWHERE  AT ANY TIME WITH NO LEGAL  RESTRICTIONS USING A SPECIAL X-BOX CONTROLLER THEN YOU ARE  CRAZY. YOU ARE NOT CRAZY THAT'S WHAT  THEY SAY. OH, MY GOD I SAW THEM.
Jon: OH, MY GOD, ASSIF  THAT'S AN AMAZING REPORT. YOU JUST -- GET HOME SAFE ASSIF. GET HOME SAFE.
THERE IS NO ASSIF. JUST THE SOUND OF WIND BLOWING  THROUGH THE TREES. [MAKING WIND SOUNDS] ASSIF IS  DEAD. THERE'S NO WAY TO FIND HIM OR  DETECT HIS BIOMETRIC HEAT  SIGNATURE.
Jon: BIOMETRIC HEAT  SIGNATURES IS THAT HOW THEY DO  IT?
I WOULDN'T KNOW I'M JUST A  TREE.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, A TREE. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF A BIOMETRIC  HEAT SIGNATURE IS THE THING THAT  MAKES DRONES FIND YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH, TREE. GET HOME SAFE, TREE AND ASSIF,  YOU DO KNOW IN FEBRUARY TREES  DON'T HAVE LEAVES, RIGHT?
DAMMIT! [LAUGHTER]
Jon: STAY SAFE,
