[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH FORMER PRESIDENT  JIMMY CARTER. IT MUST BE INTERESTING FOR YOU. YOU WERE PRESIDENT 1976 TO 1980. YOU KNOW, DURING THAT TIME YOU  HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME WITH  CRAZY NORTH KOREA LEADER THAT YOU HAD TO TRY TOLL NEGOTIATE  OUT DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
YES.
Jon: THERE WAS AN INVASION  OF AFGHANISTAN THAT YOU HAD TO  TAKE A STAND ON. DOES IT EVER STRIKE YOU AS -- SO  HAVE WE MOVED NOWHERE? ARE WE JUST GERBILS RUNNING ON A  WHEEL? [LAUGHTER] THIS IS THE THIRD GENERATION OF  KIMS THAT IS -- THEN THE FORTH  THE KARDASHIAN. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT ARE USING SORT OF NUCLEAR  THREAT TO GAIN SOME TYPE OF  ATTENTION.
WELL, WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS  PRESIDENT, I WENT OVER TO NORTH  KOREA BECAUSE WE WERE FACED WITH A WAR BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND  SOUTH CREAL. I NOILGTED WITH THE SEEN --  SOUTH KOREA. I NEGOTIATED WITH THE SENIOR KIM  WHO WAS WORSHIPED LIKE JESUS  CHRIST AND GEORGE WASHINGTON  COMBINED. THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING HE SAID. WE NEGOTIATED FOR A NUMBER OF  HOURS. HE AGREED WITH EVERYTHING I  PROPOSED. I BROUGHT THAT BACK WITH TO  PRESIDENT CLINTON AND HE GOT IT  IN WRIGHT. WE GOT A FIRM COMMITMENT BETWEEN  THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH  KOREA THAT THEY WOULDN'T BUILD NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND WE WOULD  SIGN A PEACE TREATY WITH THEM. WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON WENT OUT  OF OFFICE AND WE HAD A DIFFERENT  PRESIDENT HE THREW THIS AGREEMENT IN THE WASTE BASKET.
Jon: YOU DON'T KNOW WHO HE  IS TALKING ABOUT COULD BE  ANYBODY.
HE THREW THE AGREEMENT IN THE  WASTE BASKET AND DECLARED THAT  NORTH KOREA WAS AN AXIS OF EVIL. THEY ARE PARANOID PEOPLE TO  START WITH AND THEY DON'T HAVE  ANYTHING TO FALL BACK EXCEPT INTELLIGENCE AND THEIR ABILITY  TO BUILD NUCLEAR WEAPONS LIKE  NOW. NOW WE HAVE A DEADLOCK OVER  THERE AND THIS NEW LEADER WHOM I  HAVEN'T MET KIM JONG-UN.
Jon: THE GRANDSON.
HE IS 30, I THINK. HE IS PARANOID AND HE HAS TO  RELY ON VERBAL THREATS.
Jon: WE DON'T TALK TO THEM.
WE DON'T TALK TO THEM.
Jon: BILL CLINTON SENT YOU  OVER. THE ONLY GUY WHO HAS BEEN THERE  IS DENNIS RODMAN. WHO THE HELL KNOWS WHAT HE SAID. HE MAY HAVE SAID I HATE THE  KNICKS BUILD A BOMB. WE DON'T KNOW.
I KNOW.
Jon: PEOPLE SAY IF THEY ARE  PARANOID PEOPLE DOES TALK TO  THEM WOULD THEY TRUST A TREATY IF WE SIGNED WITH IT THEM? HOW DO YOU MAKE --
ANYTHING ELSE THEY WANT THEY  TELL ME WHEN I GO. I'VE BEEN THERE THREE TIMES. IF THEY WANT A PEACE TREATY WITH  THE UNITED STATES, WE'VE NOT HAD  A PEACE TREATY YET. WE HAD A CEASE FIRE AT THE END  OF THE KOREAN WAR.
Jon: HE SUSPENDED THAT BY  THE WAY. NO LONGER WAS THE CEASE FIRE IN  OPERATION.
HE SUSPENDED THE CEASE FIRE  WITH SOUTH KOREAN -- SOUTH KOREA  WHICH THEY NEVER HAVE HAD.
Jon: I HAVE TO GO BACK AND  WASH MASH BECAUSE -- [LAUGHTER]
THEY HAD A PEACE TREATY  BETWEEN THEM AND THE UNITED  STATES.
Jon: DON'T YOU THINK EVEN  CHINA WHO HAS BEEN IN MANY WAYS  THE POWER BEHIND THE CRAZINESS. THEY'VE BECOME SLIGHTLY FED UP  WITH THIS REGIME AND ARE NO  LONGER BACKING THEM TO THE SAME EXTEND THAT THEY WERE AND  DOESN'T THAT REMOVE REALLY ANY  OF THEIR PROTECTION?
I THINK SO. I GO TO CHINA EVERY YEAR TO TALK  TO THEM. I SAY VERY DISCOURAGED OR MAYBE  ANGRY WITH THE NORTH KOREANS BUT  THEY KNOW THAT NORTH KOREA'S STABILITY AS IT EXISTS RELIES ON  THEIR TRADE AND COMMERCE. WE'VE HAD AN ECONOMIC EMBARGO  AGAINST NORTH KOREA FOR 60  YEARS. THEY DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO  DESTROY THEIR ECONOMY. THEY KNOW THAT.
Jon: WE DID SEND THEM RUM.
WE DID. I'M NOT SURE THE GOVERNMENT DID  THAT BUT ANYWAY.
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU  ARE STILL DOING THAT TYPE OF  DIPLOMATIC -- DO YOU GET MILES -- WHEN YOU GO DO YOU GET  TO UPGRADE?
WHEN I RIDE ON DEALT YEAH GET  FREQUENT FLIER MILES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I LOVE IT. PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS A
