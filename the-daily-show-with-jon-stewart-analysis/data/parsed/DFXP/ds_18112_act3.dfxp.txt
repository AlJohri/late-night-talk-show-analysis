Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO WE WERE JUST WATCHING, WE  WERE JUST WATCHING A FIELD  PIECE IN WHICH JASON JONES INTERVIEWED IRANIAN  JOURNALIST MAZIAR BAHARI IN  TEHRAN, THE REAL TEHRAN, NOT  ON A GREEN SCREEN. AND IT WAS ALL JUST GOOD  CLEAN FUN, JUST GOOD, CLEAN,  COMEDIC, SAT TIRIC ART, IT'S WHAT WE DO. IT'S SO CLEVER. AND THEN I GUESS ABOUT A  WEEK AFTER IT AIRED, THIS  HAPPENED.
BAHARI WAS DETAINED  WITHOUT CHARGE SUNDAY  MORNING IN TEHRAN. HE HAS NOT BEEN HEARD FROM  SINCE. SO I FELT LIKE [BLEEP]. WHAT HAPPENED WAS RIGHT  AFTER THE ELECTION AFTER THE  RIOTS THEY STARTED ARRESTING A TON OF PEOPLE AND  DETAINING THEM. MAZIAR WAS HELD IN EVAN  PRISON FOR THREE MONTHS IN  SOLITARY, HE WAS TORTURED  AND INTERROGATED. AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE WAS  INTERROGATED ABOUT WAS BEING  IN CONTACT WITH AN AMERICAN  SPY. THE AMERICAN SPY IN QUESTION  WAS THIS GUY. THEY PLAYED THE TAPE OF THE  PIECE FOR MAZIAR IN THE  PRISON AND SUGGESTED WHY WAS HE MEETING WITH A SPY. NOW FIRST OF ALL, JASON IS  IN THE A SPY. AND SECOND OF ALL, HE'S  CANADIAN. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  SO ANYWAY, AS YOU CAN  IMAGINE, A COUPLE OTHER  PEOPLE THAT WE SPOKE TO IN RA HAM IAZI AND A CLERIC  ALSO IN THE PIECES WERE  ARRESTED AND DETAINED ALONG  WITH THOUSANDS OF IRANIANS. THE GOOD NEWS IS, IT HAD  NOTHING TO DO WITH US. IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY EASE  THE PAIN WE FELT FOR PEOPLE  THAT HAD BECOME DEAR FRIENDS OF OURS AT THAT POINT, BUT  IT DID EASE SOME OF THE  GUILT. BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS AFTER  MAZIAR WAS RELEASED DUE TO  AN INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN THAT HELPED HIM GET OUT, HE  DECIDED TO WRITE A BOOK  ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE CALLED THEN THEY CAME FOR ME. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE BOOK. HE'S A WONDERFUL WRITER. HE AND I BECAME FRIENDLY, WE  SAT, WE HAD A BUNCH OF  BREAKFASTS TOGETHER AND  DECIDED WHY DON'T WE TRY AND TURN THIS DAMN THING INTO A  MOVIE. AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS. SO WE WROTE A LITTLE SCRIPTY  SCRIPT AND AM GOING TO HEAD  OUT AND DO THAT BECAUSE-- IN TRUTH, GREAT LITERATURE IS  NOT GREAT LITERATURE UNTIL  IT HAS BEEN MADE INTO A  MOVIE. THE GREAT GATSBY, THE BIBLE,  CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF  MEATBALLS. SO I WROTE THE SCRIPT, PUT  IT IN AN ENVELOPE MARKED  HOLLYWOOD! CARE OF PRODUCERS! AND DROPPED IT IN THE MAIL  BOX. NEXT THING I KNEW I WAS  HEADED TO WHERE STARS ARE  BORN, THE MIDDLE-- MIDDLE  EAST, IN THE DEAD OF SUMMER. SO THAT'S MY STORY. I CONSIDER IT A REALLY GREAT  HONOR THAT MAZIAR IS  TRUSTING ME TO TELL HIS  STORY AND I JUST HOPE DEARLY THAT I DON'T SCREW IT UP. BE CHECKING IN WITH JOHN  OLIVER THROUGHOUT THE SUM  TORE MAKE SURE HE IS FEEDING MY PLANTS AND WATERING MY  CHILDREN. HE'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE. AND I CAN'T THANK ENOUGH THE  CREW HERE AND THE STAFF HERE  FOR COVERING FOR MY SORRY ASS ALL THESE MONTHS WHILE I  WAS WORKING ON THIS. AND I WILL MISS YOU FAR MORE  THAN YOU WILL MISS ME. AND I CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK  BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR  INDULGENCE. WE'LL BE BACK IN JUST A  MINUTE FOR MY
