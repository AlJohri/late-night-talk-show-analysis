FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WHOA. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". I'M JON STEWART. I HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT WE HAVE YOUR TY BURRELL. TY BURRELL IS ON THE PROGRAM BEST KNOWN FOR MODERN FAMILY BUT DID YOU KNOW HE ALSO PLAYS A TIME TRAVELING DOG? GUY HAS RANGE. THE BIG NEWS THE SOCHI OLYMPIC GAMES BEGAN THIS WEEKEND WITH THE POMP PAGEANTRY AND NOSTALGIA FOR DEHUMANIZING INDUSTRIAL COLLECTIVIZATION ENDING WITH THE RUSSIAN CHAMPIONS RUNNING THE 1,000 METER OLYMPIC TORCH LIGHTING -- [LAUGHTER] AND THEY ARE -- THEY ARE RUNNING TO LIGHT THE TORCH AND THEN IT JUST GETS FURTHER AND FURTHER AND -- THEY ARE RUNNING TO THE -- [LAUGHTER] THE -- LIGHT IS GOING TO GO OUT. A NOTE TO AFFILIATES WE'LL GO LONG ON ACCOUNT OF THE RUNNING WE'LL CHECK BACK IN LATER. TEAM USA WON ITS FIRST GOLD IN THE EVENT OF BUSTAGE WHEN THE AMERICAN BOBSLEDDER JOHNNY QUINN SCORED IN THE ONE METER DOOR HOLE THAT HE HAD TO CREATE BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET OUT OF THE POORLY CONSTRUCTED BATHROOM. THEY MADE THE BATHROOM AND HE COULDN'T GET OUT OF IT. IT WAS A HUGE UPSET THOUGH. GOLD WAS EXPECTED TO GO TO THE KOOL AID MAN. KOOL AID MAN HAS TO SETTLE FOR SILVER. MANY STORIES OF SOCHI'S UNCOMPLETED AND UNSAFE FACILITIES BUT THIS ONE HAS TO BE MY FAVORITE.
MY HOTEL HAS NO WATER. IF RESTORED THE FRONT DESK SAYS DO NOT USE ON YOUR FACE BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SOMETHING VERY DANGEROUS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: AND IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU, WE'D RATHER NOT TELL YOU WHAT THAT VERY DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE IS. WHO DOESN'T LIST -- WHO SAYS IT'S GOT DANGEROUS THINGS AND DOESN'T SAY WHAT IS IN THERE? DANGEROUS LIKE EX-LAX OR ACID? NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE IT'S WATER WITH A DOUBLE BLACK DIAMOND RATING. THAT IS NEVER -- EXPERTS ONLY. BUT I DON;T THINK ANYONE IS STICKING THEIR FACE IN THAT CLOUDY AMBER LIQUID. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT STUFF LOOKS LIKE.
TAP WATER THE COLOR OF BEER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] SURE, BEER. THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. AND NOT WHAT BEER BECOMES. [ LAUGHTER ] RUSSIAN OFFICIALS THOUGH WERE QUICK TO DEFEND THEIR TOXIC TAP PISS.
RUSSIA IS NOT TAKING THE CRITICISM WELL CLAIMING ITS OLYMPIC IMAGE IS BEING DELIBERATELY ATTACKED BY JOURNALISTS. WE HAVE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM THE HOTELS THAT SHOWS PEOPLE TURN ON THE SHOWER, DIRECT THE NOZZLE AT THE WALL AND LEAVE THE ROOM FOR THE WHOLE DAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: TWO QUICK THINGS:  ONE THAT DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS THE CURIOUS AND APPARENTLY DANGEROUS YELLOWNESS OF THE WATER AND NUMBER TWO WHEN YOU'RE MOUNTING A DEFENSE OF YOUR COUNTRY'S OLYMPIC PREP, I WOULD LEAVE OUT THE PART WHERE YOU SAY YOU HAVE CAMERAS IN EVERYONE'S BATHROOM. [ LAUGHTER ] LISTEN I -- THEY ARE LYING. EVERYONE IS LYING BECAUSE I TELL YOU THIS -- THEY ARE LYING I KNOW THAT THEIR ROOMS ARE NICE BECAUSE I'M UNDER THE BED WHEN YOU ARE SLEEPING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT OF COURSE, WHILE THE CONDITIONS IN SOCHI ARE QUITE CONTROVERSIAL APPARENTLY MOSCOW IS BEAUTIFUL THIS TIME OF YEAR OR SO JASON JONES FOUND OUT IN THE "THE DAILY SHOW"'S EXCLUSIVE OLYMPIC COVERAGE JASON JONES LIVE FROM SOCHI-ISH. â™ª
FORGET THE MEDIA CIRCUS IN SOCHI, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND RUSSIA YOU HAVE TO COME TO MOSCOW, SO I DID. AND THE LINGERING EFFECTS OF COMMUNISM WERE EVERYWHERE RIGHT DOWN TO THE ENDLESS LINES FOR BASIC NECESSITIES. WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR, GUYS? BREAD, TOILET PAPER?
SHAKE SHACK.
WHAT THE (bleep). YOU HAVE A SHAKE SHACK HERE? IT TURNS OUT IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE AMERICA WITH A (bleep) UP ALPHABET.  BUT IS RUSSIA REALLY RUNNING ON DACHNA? I SPOKE WITH A PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE RUSSIAN DUMA WHO SERVED IN THE ADMINSTRATIONS OF GORBACHEV, YELTSIN AND PUTIN AND WAS THE GRANDSON TO THE RIGHT HAND OF STALIN. USUALLY AMERICA THINKS OF RUSSIA AS A WILD, UNDERDEVELOPED, UNDEMOCRATIC, IMPERIAL -- EVIL.
M-HMM AND THOSE STEREOTYPES ARE WRONG BECAUSE?
RUSSIA IS NOT VICIOUS, NOT WILD, NOT IMPERIAL OR DICTATORIAL. SO YOU ARE WRONG.
BUT AVERAGE RUSSIANS WOULD KNOW I WAS RIGHT. WHO IS GOOD GUY? WHO IS THE BAD GUY?
BAD GUY, BAD RUSSIAN STEREOTYPE.
THAT'S A GREAT RUSSIAN STEREOTYPE.
THESE GUYS SHOULD BE BAD GUYS BUT ACTUALLY THIS IS AMERICAN (bleep) I THINK.
THEY MAY HAVE BEEN STEREOTYPES, BUT NO ONE CAN ARGUE WITH THE GREATEST PRESIDENT WHO CALLED THE RUSSIANS AN EVIL EMPIRE.
I NEVER CONSIDERED MYSELF TO BE EVIL OR PART OF AN EVIL EMPIRE.
BUT YOU SOUND EVIL.
ME?
YES.
WHY?
BECAUSE BAD GUYS LIKE THIS. GOOD GUYS TALK LIKE ME. NO I DON'T THINK SO.
NO BAD GUYS TALK LIKE THIS. NO BAD GUYS TALK LIKE THIS. ARE YOU DOING AN AMERICAN ACCENT?
UH --
HE COULD JOKE ALL HE WANTED BUT HE COULDN'T HIDE FROM HIS EVIL HISTORY.
A GOOD GUY WOULD PROBABLY DEFEAT THE NAZIS.
WHICH WE DID.
AND YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS THE CASUALTY LIST OF AMERICANS IN WORLD WAR II?
A LOT LESS THAN RUSSIANS BECAUSE WE'RE BETTER FIGHTERS.
90% OF THE GERMAN DIVISIONS WERE DEFEATED BY THE SOVIET UNION. YOU ARE REWRITING HISTORY RIGHT NOW. THE GOOD GUYS ARE ALSO LAUNCHING THE FIRST MAN IN SPACE.
YOU STOLE TECHNOLOGY FROM US.
YOU STOLE TECHNOLOGY FROM US. YOU WERE WAGING A WAR IN VIETNAM THAT'S NOT WHAT THE GOOD GUYS WERE DOING.
WHAT ABOUT ATTACKING AFGHANISTAN?
THAT WAS A BAD IDEA, ABSOLUTELY.
TERRIBLE.
YOU ATTACKED AFGHANISTAN.
YOU ATTACKED AFGHANISTAN.
BUT YOU ALSO ATTACKED AFGHANISTAN.
BUT DID YOU IT FIRST.
BUT YOU PREVENTED US FROM DOING THE JOB. WHO CREATED AL QAEDA?
YOU DID.
US?
AL QAEDA WAS EXACTLY THE CREATION OF AMERICAN SPECIAL SERVICES.
WOULD FREEDOM FIGHTERS NEED TO EXIST IF RUSSIA DIDN'T ATTACK THEM NEARBY?
WHO CREATED THE FREEDOM FIGHTER MOVEMENT YOU REALLY CREATED FRANKENSTEIN, THE MONSTER.
AS I ARGUED WITH HIM I REALIZED HOW MUCH I MISSED OUR OLD ENEMY, A WORLD ON THE BRINK DUCKING AND COVERING BECAUSE RED SQUARE WAS FILLED WITH AN OVERWHELMING DISPLAY OF UNNECESSARY MILITARY MIGHT. NOW IT JUST HAS A (bleep) ICE SKATING RINK. USED TO HANG PEOPLE IN THIS SQUARE NOW THERE'S AN ICE RINK. I DON'T GET IT. THEY HELPED US KEEP THE WORLD IN CHECK. NOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE (bleep) AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY HOCKEY. COMRADE, YOU HAVE TO MISS THE OLD DAYS.
I DON'T MISS THE COLD WAR.
IT WAS SO GOOD!
WE WERE LIKE HOOLIGANS IN A BAR.
WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
RUSSIAN ROULETTE IS NOT MY GAME. YOU INVENTED THAT GAME.
YOU CHANGED, MAN. I DON'T LIKE THIS NEW YOU.
WELL, I LIKE MYSELF.
IF ONLY RONALD REAGAN HADN'T ENDED THE COLD WAR BY TEARING DOWN THAT --
ACTUALLY GORBACHEV WAS THE ONE WHO UNILATERALLY ENDED THE COLD WAR.
FOR (bleep) SAKE FINE IF IT WAS GORBACHEV WE'LL TALK TO HIM.
WHO ASKED FOR THIS MEETING WAS IT YOU OR THE COLLEAGUE?
IT WAS ME, I WANTED TO COME SEE HIM.
IF YOU BRING CAMERAS IN HERE AGAIN, I WILL PUT YOU AGAINST THE WALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU ARE GOING TO PUT ME AGAINST THE WALL?
YES.
AFTER MR. GORBACHEV WAS DONE THREATENING ME I FINALLY GOT TO ASK MY QUESTION. MR. GORBACHEV CAN YOU PUT BACK THAT WALL?
THE WALL CAME DOWN AND IT'S A GREAT THING IT HAPPENED AND WE NEED TO KEEP GOING ALONG THE PATH WE CHOSE.
SO I'M TAKING THAT AS A NO.
OKAY, I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. LET'S WRAP IT UP.
SADLY THE COLD WAR IS OVER BUT THERE'S ONE PLACE WHERE YOU CAN RELIVE THE GLORIOUS PAST, STALIN'S BUNKER COMPLEX 18 STORIES BELOW GROUND WHERE THEY REENACT THE NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION OF AMERICA. IT'S ARMAGEDDON EVERY 15 MINUTES. WHOO.
AMERICA, AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?
I HAVE A QUESTION, YOU DON'T MISS BEING THAT KICK ASS SUPERPOWER, US COWERING UNDER OUR DESKS.
WHY DESKS?
BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE HIDING FROM THE RUSKIES WHO WERE GOING TO BOMB US.
BOMB COME, YOU DIE.
WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY, YEAH, IT WAS A STUPID PLAN. ONE I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET BACK TO.
DUCK AND COVER.
Jon: JASON JONES FROM RUSSIA. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
