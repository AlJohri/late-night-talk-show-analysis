FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART."  CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY  COMEDY CENTRAL [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
John: WELCOME TO THE DAIL  SHOW. WELCOME. I AM JOHN OLIVER. JON STEWART JON STEWART IS STILL  NOT HERE. MOST OF YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE  HE'S CURRENTLY ON A RUG SPRINGER  AND HE EEL BE BACK SOME TIME AT THE START OF OCTOBER. HE LOVES ROLLER COASTERS. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE CREATOR  OF "THE NEWSROOM," AARON SORKIN  IS HERE. THE PRINCE, THE KING. IT IS SO GREAT TO BE BAN WITH  YOU FROM OUR TWO-WEEK BREAK. IT WAS TOUGH TO BE AWAY, WE WERE  MISSOG MANY FUN THINGS TO COVER,  KATE MIDDLETON ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH TO THE GREATEST BABY IN  THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION,  BORN IN THE TRADITIONAL MANNER, FIGHTING THEIR WAY OUT OF HER  WOMB AND CUTTING THEIR OWN UM  BELL D.L. CORD WITH A SWORD ONLY THEY COULD WIELD. LAST THURSDAY BRIAN KILMEADE  THREW A BASKETBALL DIRECTLY INTO  A TODDLER'S FACE. WOW. THAT IS THE WORST DAY THAT BRIAN  KILMEADE HAS HAD SINCE THE TIME  THEY LET HIM HUG A RABBIT AND HE SQUEEZED IT TOO HARD. AND THEN ON FRIDAY, A SAN  FRANCISCO TV STATION GOT PUNKED  INTO READING THESE NAMES AS A KOREAN FLIGHT CREW.
CAPTAIN SUM CHI WONG, WEE TOO  LOW, HO LEE FU K AND BANG TI  WOW.
John: HOW COULD WE MISS  THAT KIND OF SPECTACULAR  BURGUNDYIESQUE FOOK-UP. YOU STAY CLASSY, SAN FRANCISCO. AFTER ALL THIS THE ENTIRE DAILY  SHOW STAFF HERE WERE CHOMPING AT  THE BIT, YES, YES, THAT'S WHAT WE LOOK LIKE. WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED? WE WERE CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO  GET BACK TO THE WORK AT THIS  COMEDY NEWS SHOW, AND THAT FEELING LASTED UNTIL AROUND  10:00 P.M. ON SATURDAY NIGHT.
WE THE JURY FIND GEORGE  ZIMMERMAN NOT GUILTY. [AUDIENCE REACTS] HOLY FOOK. SO HE'S INNOCENT? WAIT. WHAT? HOW COULD THAT POSSIBLY... YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING... THERE'S NO... I CAN'T EVEN... OH, MY GOD. WHICH I GUESS IS WHAT WE'LL CALL  TONIGHT'S SEGMENT. BECAUSE THAT FEELS ABOUT RIGHT. THAT FEELS IN YOUR HEART ABOUT  RIGHT. OF THE MANY TRULY DEPRESSING  THINGS ABOUT THIS CASE, WHERE  MAN WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY AFTER ADMITTING PURSUING AND SHOOTING  AN UNARMED TEENAGER, ONE IS JUST  HOW UNSURPRISED PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ABOUT THE VERDICT.
THEY HAD NO OTHER OPTION  GIVEN THE LAW IN FLORIDA.
IF AT ANY POINT IN THAT  ALTERCATION THAT ZIMMERMAN FELT  THAT HIS LIFE WAS IN GRAVE BODILY HARM OR IMMINENT DANGER,  HE HAD THE RIGHT UNDER FLORIDA'S  LAW TO PULL THAT TRIGGER.
John: RIGHT. AND THIS IS WHAT MAKES THIS SO  MUCH WORSE THAT WE CAN GET A  VERDICT LIKE THIS NOT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN DOWN, BUT  BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WORKED  EXACTLY AS IT'S DESIGNED. HOW DID 2013 FLORIDA HAVE LAW  THAT SEEMS CUT AND PASTED FROM  1881 TOMBSTONE? [LAUGHTER] LET'S BE CLEAR HERE, ACCORDING  TO CURRENT FLORIDA LAW, YOU CAN  GET A GUN, FOLLOW AN UNARMED MINOR, CALL THE POLICE, HAVE  THEM EXPLICITLY TELL YOU TO STOP  FOLLOWING THEM, THEN CHOOSE TO IGNORE THAT, KEEP FOLLOWING THE  MINOR, GET INTO A CONFRONTATION  WITH THEM AND IF AT ANY POINT DURING THAT PROCESS YOU GET  SCARED, YOU CAN SHOOT THE MINOR  TO DEATH AND THE STATE OF FLORIDA WILL SAY, WELL, LOOK,  YOU DID WHAT YOU COULD. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK  IT MIGHT HONESTLY BE TIME FOR  THE SUNSHINE STATE TO OFFICIALLY CHANGE ITS MOTTO. YES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LOOK, LOOK, THIS IS... [LAUGHTER] THIS IS AN AWFUL STORY. AND IT IS HARD TO MAKE A CASE  FOR IT NOT BEING AT LEAST  PARTIALLY ABOUT RACE. YOU KNOW, IT DEFINITELY HAS SOME  RACIAL UNDERTONES IF NOT RACIAL  ONLY TONES. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN  LEARN FROM THIS TERRIBLE  TRAGEDY? LET'S HEAR FROM GEORGE  ZIMMERMAN'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY?
THE PROSECUTION RAISED THIS  QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THE  OUTCOME WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF THE RACES OF THE DEFENDANT AND  THE VICTIM WERE DIFFERENT.
I THINK THAT THINGS WOULD  HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF GEORGE  ZIMMERMAN WAS BLACK FOR THIS REASON: HE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN  CHARGED WITH A CRIME.
John: YEAH, I SUPPOSE THE  ONE THING THAT OUR JUSTICE  SYSTEM IS NOTORIOUS FOR IS HOW LENIENT IT IS ON BLACK PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, AS LONG AS WE'RE DOING  HYPOTHETICALS, I WONDER WHAT IT  WOULD FEEL LIKE IF GEORGE ZIMMERMAN HAD, SAY, A FAMILY  MEMBER, MAYBE A BROTHER, WHO  SAID SOMETHING SO BREATHTAKINGLY UNAWARE THAT IT MAKES YOU THINK  THAT THERE MIGHT GENUINELY BE A  GENETIC PROBLEM IN THE ZIMMERMAN FAMILY POOL.
THE KID'S A FREE MAN IN THE  EYES OF THE COURT, BUT HE'S  GOING TO BE LOOKING AROUND HIS SHOULDER FOR THE REST OF HIS  LIFE. THERE ARE FACTION, THERE ARE  GROUPS, THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT  WOULD WANT TO TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AS THEY PERCEIVE  IT OR, YOU KNOW, BE VIGILANTES  IN SOME SENSE.
John: YEAH, YOU JUST HEARD  RIGHT. THAT WAS GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S  BROTHER EXPRESSING A FEAR OF  ARMED VIGILANTES. IF FLORIDA'S LAWS ARE SO FLAWED  AS TO LET A TRAGIC INCIDENT LIKE  THIS GO UNPUNISHED, WHAT, I WONDER, ARE THEY GOING TO DO  ABOUT IT IN
DO YOU SEE ANY ACTION ON THE  STAND YOUR GROUND LAWS, ON THE  GUN LEGISLATION COMING OUT OF THE OUTRAGE OVER THE DECISION?
NOT IN FLORIDA. AS YOU RECALL, THE GOVERNOR  APPOINTED A COMMISSION. THEY DIDN'T RECOMMEND ANY  CHANGES. PEOPLE IN FLORIDA LIKE THEIR  GUNS.
John: OKAY, FLORIDA, JUST  BECAUSE YOU'RE SHAPED LIKE SOME  COMBINATION OF A GUN AND A [BLEEPED] DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE  TO ACT THAT WAY. NO, NO, NO! LET ME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LET ME TAKE THAT BACK. LET ME TAKE THAT BACK. I'M SORRY. THAT'S AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE. I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I TAKE IT BACK. THE FACT IS, WHETHER WE AGREE  WITH THEM OR NOT -- AND WE  DON'T -- THE SUNSHINE STATE DOES HAVE VERY STRONG SELF-DEFENSE  LAWS, INCLUDING ITS FAMOUS  "STAND YOUR GROUND" PROVISION. THEY MAY SEEM STUPID -- THEY DO  SEEM INCREDIBLY STUPID -- BUT AT  LEAST THEY'RE APPLIED RIGOROUSLY ACROSS THE BOARD.
A FLORIDA WOMAN HAS BEEN  SENTENCED TO 20 YEARS IN PRISON  FOR FIRING A GUN INTO THE AIR. MARISSA ALEXANDER'S DEFENSE WAS  FLORIDA'S STAND YOUR GROUND LAW,  BUT A JUDGE RULED THAT THE LAW DIDN'T APPLY IN THE CASE OF  ALEXANDER FIRING A GUN INTO THE  AIR TO SUPPOSEDLY SCARE OFF HER ABUSIVE HUSBAND. THE JURY CONVICTED ALEXANDER  AFTER ONLY 12 MINUTES. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
John: HAS IT EVER OCCURRED  TO ANYONE WHEN VISITING ORLANDO  THAT WHEN MICKEY MOUSE IS WAVING AT YOU, WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY  TRYING TO SAY IS, "PLEASE,  SOMEONE GET ME THE [BLEEPED] OUT OF HERE. THESE PEOPLE ARE [BLEEPED] CRAZY  "? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
