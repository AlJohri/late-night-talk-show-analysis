Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUESTS TONIGHT, THEY HAVE COAUTHORED A PAPER TITLED "TESTING THEORIES OF AMERICAN POLITICS: ELITES, INTEREST GROUPS, AND AVERAGE CITIZENS". IT WILL APPEAR IN THE FALL EDITION OF ACADEMIC JOURNAL. IT'S REALLY THE BEST EDITION, THE SWIMSUIT EDITION, ACTUALLY, THE PERSPECTIVE ON POLITICS. PLEASE WELCOME MARTIN GILENS AND BENJAMIN PAGE. COME ON OUT. HOW ARE YOU, SIR? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU. COME AND SIT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
PLEASURE.
Jon: THE PEOPLE LOVE A QUANTITIVE ANALYSIS. [ LAUGHTER ] TALK TO US VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE THIS PAPER TRIES TO STATISTICALLY QUANTIFY THAT FEELING THAT EVERYONE HAS THAT ACCESS AND POWER AND INFLUENCE DISPROPORTIONATELY GO TO ELITES. SO, IS THAT WHAT THE ATTEMPT WAS HERE TO DO, TO STATISTICALLY QUANTIFY THAT IN ANYWAY?
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
Jon: OK, THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE. ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] HOW DID YOU TRY DO THAT?
MARTIN SPENT TEN YEARS DOING IT.
Jon: YOU SPENT TEN YEARS DOING IT?
I DID.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I AM A LAST MINUTE ADDITION, HONESTLY.
Jon: OH, IS THAT REALLY TRUE. BUT DID YOU WRITE THE PAPER TOGETHER OR?
WE WROTE IT TOGETHER. IT WAS BEN'S IDEA. AND IT WAS BEN'S IDEA THAT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH INTEREST IN THE COUNTRY THAT WE SHOULD PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE AND SEE IF THE MEDIA CARED ABOUT IT.
Jon: THAT'S A SMART THING. YOU COME UP WITH THE IDEA AND YOU SAY TO THIS GENTLEMAN, WHY DON'T YOU WORK ON THAT FOR TEN YEARS?
YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT IT.
Jon: IN THIS ANALYSIS, IF YOU WILL, I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT A STATISTICIAN, I'M NOT AN ECONOMIST, I WOULD SAY YOU REPRESENT THE ELITES. AND YOU HAVE HAD YOUR ASS QUANTITATIVELY HANDED TO YOU.
NO, NO, NO. IT GOT ME ON YOUR SHOW, JON. AND, TEN YEARS WAS WORTH IT.
Jon: YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AND I'M DELIGHTED. HOW DO YOU QUANTIFY SOMETHING LIKE THAT? WHAT METRICS DO YOU USE?
WE LOOKED AT A COUPLE THOUSAND POTENTIAL POLICY CHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS, AND WE MEASURED WHAT ORDINARY CITIZENS WANTED WHETHER THEY FAVORED OR OPPOSED THEM AND WHAT ELITES, ECONOMIC ELITES, WANTED, AND WHERE INTEREST GROUPS FELL. AND BY HAVING MEASURES OF ALL THOSE THINGS WE COULD PUT THEM INTO A STATISTICAL MODEL THAT WOULD TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF EACH OF THOSE SETS OF ACTORS.
Jon: RIGHT, LET ME ASK YOU, THOUGH. WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING HERE IN THIS CASE. THE BIVARIATE REGRESSION YOU'RE USING, YOU HAVE .18 DIFFERENTIAL AND A .22 DIFFERENTIAL OF THE INTEREST GROUPS AND THE OTHER. NOW, WHEN YOU USE THOSE AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES THEY DIFFER DRAMATICALLY BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO STRONGLY RELATE THOSE BIVARIATE CORRELATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE SO CLOSE, DOESN'T THAT SUGGEST YOU HAVE A MULTICOLA -- LINEARITY PROBLEM.
OH, MY GOD. YOU THINK SO? IT COULD BE!
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I JUST SAID. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS: DO THE ELITES, IS THE VARIABLE ENOUGH FROM WHAT THE NON-ELITE PUBLIC WANTS TO WHAT THE ELITES WANT? DID YOU FIND A LARGE SPREAD BETWEEN THEIR AIMS?
YES, YEAH. THERE'S SOME VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES INCLUDING SOCIAL SECURITY DEFICITS, ECONOMIC REGULATIONS, TAXES.
Jon: ARE YOU ABLE TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE MONEY MAKES OR HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE, YOU KNOW -- CAN YOU LOOK AT DIFFERENT INTEREST GROUPS AND SEE -- ALMOST CALCULATE WHAT THEIR EFFECT IS? LIKE WHO IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE PRIVATE LOBBY GROUP? WHAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MONEY?
WITH OUR DATA NOT REALLY. WE LOOKED AT LOBBYISTS, WE LOOKED AT INTEREST GROUPS AS A WHOLE. WE WERE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH MASS BASED GROUPS LIKE AFL-CIO OR THE AARP FROM BUSINESS GROUPS. BUT BEYOND THAT WE CAN'T REALLY SAY.
Jon: RIGHT, NOW, WHY WOULD THOSE BE DIFFERENT? IF MONEY IS MONEY, WHY WOULD AFL-CIO BE DIFFERENT FROM A BUSINESS GROUP?
IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. AND IT TURNS OUT THEY ARE NOT THAT DIFFERENT. WHAT THE DIFFERENCE COMES FROM IS THERE'S A LOT MORE BUSINESS GROUPS.
Jon: OH, LABOR IS UNDERREPRESENTED IN TERMS OF, AND THAT WOULD REFLECT IN TERMS OF POLICY.
EXACTLY.
Jon: OK, ARE THERE INTEREST GROUPS THAT ARE REALLY WASTING THEIR MONEY? LIKE CAN YOU LOOK AT A CERTAIN GROUP AND SAY WOW CLUB FOR GROWTH IS GETTING BANG FOR THEIR BUCK BUT THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS INEFFICIENT AND BEING RIPPED OFF BY THEIR LOBBYISTS.
IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW BUT WE CAN'T TELL.
Jon: YOU CAN'T TELL.
CAN'T TELL.
Jon: I GUESS WHAT I'M GOING FOR IS -- [LAUGHTER] -- I WANT TO GET A LOBBYIST FANTASY LEAGUE GOING WHERE WE CAN GET THE STATISTICS AND TRADE THEM LIKE MONEY BALL, LIKE SABERMETRICS BUT FOR LOBBYISTS BECAUSE THEN WE COULD TRACK IT STATISTICALLY AND HAVE A MUCH CLEARER VISION OF WHO WE'RE UP AGAINST. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS WHAT I JUST REALIZED:  I AM FAILING THIS CLASS. WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THE DIFFERENTIAL THEN? WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, KRUGMAN WROTE A COLUMN AND HE SAID THIS STUDY IS OKAY BUT IT'S GOING TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE AND THAT'S BAD. AND, I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT. THIS IS A SOLVABLE PROBLEM. I THINK IT TAKES A VERY BIG SOCIAL MOVEMENT. I THINK IT TAKES BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP AND IT ACTUALLY TAKES WEALTHY PEOPLE ON THE SAME SIDE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. NOTHING SEEMS TO HAPPEN IN AMERICAN POLITICS OF ANY IMPORTANCE FOR --
Jon: RIGHT, I WAS GOING TO SAY, DO YOU KNOW OF A COUNTRY WHERE THAT COULD HAPPEN? IS THERE ANYTHING --
WELL, THE UNITED STATES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20th CENTURY, THE PROGRESSIVE PERIOD. I THINK IT'S REALLY WORTH LOOKING BACK TO THAT AND LEARNING SOME LESSONS.
Jon: STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT AFTER THE BREAK AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE MECHANICS OF THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE TO SOME EXTENT OR HOW TOP QUANTIFY THAT TO SOME EXTENT. YOU CAN BUY ALSO, MARTIN YOU HAVE A BOOK OUT, RIGHT?
I DO INDEED.
Jon: IN FACT, I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE IT RIGHT HERE. IT'S CALLED AFFLUENCE AND INFLUENCE. IT WAS THIS GUY'S IDEA. AND THEN THIS GUY SPENT 20 YEARS WRITING IT AND I DON'T KNOW WHO IS GETTING THE ROYALTIES, PROBABLY ME. IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. MARTIN GILEN SAND BENJAMIN PAGE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
