FEBRUARY 27, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. I'M JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. TONIGHT ON THE PROGRAM-- AND I CAN SAY THIS WITHOUT ANY HESITATION AT ALL, MY FAVORITE  ASTROPHYSICIST ON THE PLANET WILL BE HERE. AUTHOR NEIL DEGRASSE WILL BE HERE. DID I SAY SPACE CHRONICLES? I MEANT TO SAY SPACE CHRONICLES. WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH HISTORY. 52 YEARS AGO AN IRISH CATHOLIC SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS SOUGHT TO TEMPER ANTI-CATHOLIC  BIGOTRY BY REASSURING THE THAT HIS POLITICAL ALLEGIANCE WAS TO AMERICA AND NOT TO THE VATICAN.
I BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE IS ABSOLUTE. WHERE NO CATHOLIC CAN TELL THE PRESIDENT, SHOULD HE BE CATHOLIC, HOW TO ACT. I BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA THAT IS OFFICIALLY NEITHER CATHOLIC, PROTESTANT, NOR JEWISH AND WHERE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IS SO INDIVISIBLE THAT AN ACT  AGAINST ONE CHURCH IS TREATED AS AN ACT AGAINST ALL.
Jon: NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, THERE IS A SHOW GIRL. IT WAS A WATERSHED MOMENT FOR CATHOLIC ASPIRATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY, ONE THAT PAVED THE  WAY FOR KENNEDY'S PRESIDENCY AND PERHAPS WITHOUT THAT SPEECH THERE WOULD BE NO  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY FOR CATHOLIC RICK SANTORUM, A DEBT HE ACKNOWLEDGES WITH THE FOLLOWING.
VERY LATE IN MY POLITICAL CAREER I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ THE SPEECH, AND I  ALMOST THREW UP. SNON I KNOW. WERE YOU READING IT IN A CAR BECAUSE THAT CAN OR A POORLY AIR ATED BUS. OR READING IT WHILE ON CONEY ISLAND ON ONE OF THOSE CRAZY PIRATE SHIP THINGY BECAUSE  IT'S HARD TO READ ON THOSE THINGS OR STAND. I CAN ONLY ASSUME YOU RICK SANTORUM WERE IN AN ILL VENTILATED VEHICLE BECAUSE  KENNEDY'S SPEECH LAYS OUT WHY SOMEONE WHO PRACTICES A FAITH THAT VOTERS ARE NOT AS  FAMILIAR WITH SHOULDN'T BE DISQUALIFIED FROM OFFICE. UNLESS... WHAT DID YOU THINK HE SAID?
TO SAY THAT PEOPLE OF FAITH HAVE NO ROLE NO ROLE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE, YOU BET THAT  MAKES YOU THROW. WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY DO WE LIVE IN.
Jon: ALL DO YOU HEAR ALL FAITHS ARE WELCOME AS NO FAITHS ARE WELCOME? DO YOU HEAR MARTIN LUTHER KING'S I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH LIKE THIS, BLACK AND WHITE  CHILDREN CAN PLAY TOGETHER. ONLY CHILDREN OF NO COLOR ARE ALLOWED TO PLAY? RICK, I'M SORRY THAT HEARING THAT J.F.K. SPEECH ON RELIGION MAKES YOU THROUGH UP. IF HE WERE ALIVE TODAY KNOWING THAT YOU WERE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO MAKE HIM (BEEP) HIS PANTS. TO BE FAIR, THAT WOULD PROBABLY JUST BE AGE. HE'D BE, I THINK, 95. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO INAUGURATE A NEW SEGMENT ON THE PROGRAM, HOW IS IT THAT  MITT ROMNEY HASN'T CRUSHED THIS GUY ALREADY? I MEAN, THE NEXT PRIMARY IS MICHIGAN. IT'S TOMORROW. ROMNEY'S HOME STATE. ROMNEY'S PROBABLY KILLING IT UP THERE IN MOTOR CITY.
I DRIVE A MUSTANG AND A CHEVY PICK-UP TRUCK. ANN DRIVES A COUPLE OF CADILLACS ACTUALLY.
Jon: THAT SOUNDS BAD. TO BE FAIR, TO BE FAIR, SHE DRIVES THEM AT THE SAME TIME. WHAT IS SHE SUPPOSED TO DO? SIT ON THE SAME FLOOR AS HER CHAUFFEUR? IS SHE GOING TO DRIVE A SINGLE LEVEL CAR, A RANCH CAR? COME ON. NO. ALL RIGHT. I KNOW HOW ROMNEY CAN FIX THIS ELITIST THING HE'S GOT GOING. TO FLORIDA AND THE DAYTONA 500. YOU LOVE NASCAR, RIGHT, MITT IS.
THIS COMBINES A COUPLE THINGS I LIKE BEST. CARS AND SPORT.
LET ME START YOU RIGHT THERE. SPORT. HERE IN THE HUMAN WORLD WE CALL THINGS LIKE NASCAR SPORTS. FOOTBALL, BASEBALL, BASKETBALL, SPORTS. SPORT, SPORT-- THAT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THING. THAT REQUIRES A HORSE OR BOAT OR AN ASCOT. OR ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS. SO DAMAGE CONTROL FOR THE CARS AND SPORT REFERENCE WHICH WAS DAMAGE CONTROL FOR THE WIFE  HAS CADILLAC REFERENCE, QUICKLY HOW CLOSELY DO YOU FOLLOW NASCAR, ROMNEY GO.
ABOUT AS CLOSELY AS SOME OF THE MOST ARDENT FANS BUT I HAVE GREAT FRIENDS THAT ARE AS  NASCAR TEAM OWNERS.
Jon: IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF THIS GUY'S MOUTH  THAT COULDN'T COME OUT OF THURSTON HOWELL III'S MOUTH. I APOLOGIZE. HOW IS IT THAT RICK SANTORUM HASN'T CRUSHED THIS GUY? THAT'S OUR NEW SEGMENT. ASIDE FROM THAT J.F.K. MAKES ME PUKE WHACKYNESS, WHY IS SANTORUM NOT BREAKING THROUGH?
PRESIDENT OBAMA ONCE SAID HE WANTS EVERYBODY IN AMERICA TO GO TO COLLEGE. WHAT A SNOB.
Jon: NO, NO, NOT (APPLAUSE) WHAT A SNOB. LOOK WHO IS EDUCATING HIS CHILDREN. I GUESS SOMEONE IS TOO GOOD FOR NOT KNOWING THINGS. RICK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT SNOBS ARE EXCLUSIONARY IN NATURE. DUDE, DO YOU KNOW WHO MUFFY WANTS TO JOIN THE COUNTRY CLUB? ALL THE MEXICANS. WHAT A SNOB. JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOUR COMING OUT AGAINST PEOPLE EDUCATING THEIR KIDS BECAUSE IT'S FANCY. EXPLAIN THAT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE NO DESIRE OR NO ASPIRATION TO GO TO COLLEGE  BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF SKILLS AND DESIRES AND DREAMS THAT DON'T INCLUDE COLLEGE. THERE ARE... THERE'S TECHNICAL SCHOOLS AND ADDITIONAL VOCATIONAL TRAINING. THERE'S SKILLS AND APPRENTICESHIPS.
Jon: I MISUNDERSTOOD. ALL SANTORUM IS SAYING IS THAT FOUR-YEAR COLLEGES AREN'T FOR EVERYONE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH TECHNICAL SCHOOLS, VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIPS  WHICH IS HARDLY THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION.
I ASK EVERY AMERICAN TO COMMIT TO AT LEAST TO ONE YEAR OR MORE OF HIGHER EDUCATION OR  CAREER TRAINING, IT COULD BE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR A FOUR-YEAR SCHOOL. VOCATIONAL TRAINING OR AN APPRENTICESHIP.
Jon: EWWWW! I JUST WINDED MYSELF. YOU KNOW, I'M BEGINNING TO SUSPECT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING MORE TO SANTORUM'S  HATRED OF COLLEGES.
I UNDERSTAND WHY HE WANTS YOU TO GO TO COLLEGE. HE WANTS TO REMAKE YOU IN HIS IMAGE.
Jon: RIDICULOUS. IF OBAMA WERE TRYING TO REMAKE US IN OUR IMAGE, HE WOULD SEND US TO A MADRASSAH. FOR MORE ON RICK SANTORUM'S COMMENTS WE SEND TO JESSICA WILLIAMS WHO JOINS US LIVE. THANKS FOR JOINING US. ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT COLLEGE ARE YOU REPORTING FROM?
DOES IT EVEN MATTER, JON? I MEAN THEY'RE ALL THE SAME. YOU GOT YOUR QUAD. YOUR STUDENT CENTER. YOUR FEMINIST BOOKSTORE. YOUR GAY BOOKSTORE. YOUR DRIVE-THROUGH ABORTION CHRICHB I CAN. ... CLINIC.
Jon: YOU ARE TECHNICALLY STILL A COLLEGE STUDENT, YES? YOU'VE SUSPENDED YOUR STUDIES A BIT TO BE ON THE PROGRAM WITH US.
YEP. YOU KNOW AFTER ALL THIS DAILY SHOW BUSINESS DIES DOWN, I'M TOTALLY GOING BACK.
Jon: YOU'RE NEVER GOING BACK, ARE YOU?
NOT IN A MILLION YEARS, JON. I'M ON TV!
Jon: VERY NICE.
LOOK, TAKE IT FROM ME, KIDS. DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND YOU GET TO BE ON TV.
Jon: NO, NO. THAT'S THE WRONG... SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THIS WHOLE COLLEGE IS JUST A LIBERAL  INDOCTRINATION CENTER WHERE BARACK OBAMA IS MAKING STUDENTS IN HIS IMAGE.
IT'S ALL TRUE, JON. CHECK THIS OUT. THIS IS ME THREE YEARS AGO. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE YOU.
IT DEFINITELY IS ME. I USED TO BE A SWEET, INNOCENT CHURCH GOING GIRL WHO BELIEVED VOLCANOS HAPPENED WHEN THE  DEVIL HAS HICK CUPS. THEN I WENT TO COLLEGE, AND THEY EXPOSED ME TO NEW IDEAS. LITERATURE, PHILOSOPHY, SOMETHING CALLED SCIENCE. AND BY THE END OF SOPHOMORE YEAR, I WAS A BLACK GIRL.
Jon: IT WAS ALL TRUE.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. IF I WOULD HAVE STAYED ONE MORE YEAR, I WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE THIS.
Jon: JESSICA, YOU KNOW, I WENT TO COLLEGE AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME.
YEAH, YOU'RE SUPER OLD AND YOU WENT TO SCHOOL LIKE 60 YEARS AGO. THEY PROBABLY REMADE YOU INTO JIMMY CARTER'S IMAGE.
Jon: OH, MY GOD. PEANUTS. WHERE DID THESE COME FROM? WAIT. ISN'T THE POINT OF COLLEGE TO EXPOSE YOUNG ADULTS TO NEW IDEAS AND NEW WAYS OF THINKING?
SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM RIGHT THERE. YOUNG ADULTS, KIDS TURN 18 AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY START THINKING FOR THEMSELVES. BUT IF THEY NEVER GROW UP, THEY'LL NEVER GET OBAMA-FIED.
Jon: ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT SANTORUM IS NAIVE 16-TO 17-YEAR-OLD GIRLS IN CATHOLIC  UNIFORMS WHO BELIEVES WHATEVER SANTORUM TELLS THEM.
