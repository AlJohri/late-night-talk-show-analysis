( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A PULITZER  PRIZE-WINNING CORRESPONDENT FOR  THE "NEW YORK TIMES." HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE WAY  OF THE KNIFE: THE CIA, A SECRET  ARMY, AND A WAR AT THE ENDS OF THE EARTH."  PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM,   MARK MAZZETTI MAZZETTI. HOW ARE YOU. NICE TO SEE YOU THP THIS IS "THE  WAY OF THE KNIFE" THE C.I.A. AND  SECRET ARMY" WHICH I'M GUESSING IS REALLY NOT SO SECRET ANYMORE.
NOT SO MUCH.
Jon:  HOW DID YOU GET  ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION?
IT WAS HARD. THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO  DON'T WANT TO TALK. AND THERE WERE SOURCES THAT I  HAD SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING  WITH OVER THE YEARS. WHO AGREED TO TALK FOR THE BOOK.
Jon:  DID YOU USE  ENHANCED INTERROGATION  TECHNIQUES?
I DIDN'T NEED TO  ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  THEY GAVE UP  INFORMATION JUST THROUGH  QUESTIONING?
YES.
Jon:  INTERESTING.
YES. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  YOU HAVE A HAVE  INTERESTING STORY AT THE VERY  BEGINNING OF THE BOOK ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO GOT IN SOME TROUBLE  OVER IN-- OVERSEAS AND WAS  REFERRED TO BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AS A DIPLOMAT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon:  TURNS OUT HE'S NOT  A COME. T.KIMLOMA
HE WORKED FOR THE OF C.I.A. HE WAS A CONTRACTOR WORKING FOR  THE C.I.A., AND IN JANUARY 2011,  HE SHOT TWO PEOPLE IN PAKISTAN ON THE STREET WHO WERE TRYING TO  ROB HIM. AND WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT --
THE ONLY THING THAT STOPS A  BAD GUY IN PAKISTAN IS A GOOD  GUY IN PAKISTAN.
GUN CONTROL.
Jon:  THERE YOU GO. ( LAUGHTER ).
HE ENDS UP IN JAIL. AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT IS  WEEKS OF DELIBERATION BETWEEN--  INSIDE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHETHER TO OWN UP TO THE  FACT THAT HE WORKED FOR THE  C.I.A. OR CONTINUE CALLING HIM A DIPLOMAT AND STONEWALL THE  PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT. IN THE END, THEY DID SAY HE WAS  WORKING FOR THE C.I.A. THERE WAS A SECRET DEAL THAT WAS  BROKERED, AND THEY GOT HIM OUT  OF THE COUNTRY IN A HURRY AFTER ABOUT $2 MILLION WAS PAID TO THE  FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS.
Jon:  OH, THAT'S  INTERESTING. SO A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY THAT  WENT THROUGH THERE. HOW DID THE C.I.A. GAIN THIS  SORT OF INDIVIDUALIZED AUTHORITY  THAT EVEN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DOESN'T HAVE? AND HOW DID WE CREATE THESE SORT  OF TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS FOR THIS  KIND OF OVERSEAS TERROR  FIGHTING?
WELL, IT'S-- ONE OF THE  THINGS THEY SORT OF TALKED ABOUT  IN THE BOOK IS HOW BASICALLY THE C.I.A. STARTED TO LOOK A WHOLE  LOT LIKE THE MILITARY AND THE  MILITARY IS LOOKING A LOT LIKE THE C.I.A. BASICALLY AFTER 9/11, PRESIDENT  BUSH GAVE THE C.I.A. LETHAL  AUTHORITY AND WIDE AUTHORITY TO GO CAPTURE AND KILL PEOPLE ALL  AROUND THE GLOBE. THIS SETS THEM OFF ON THE  BEGINNING OF SOME OF THESE  SECRET WARS, AND IT'S-- IT STARTS OUT WITH A LOT OF  DETENTIONS AND INTERROGATIONS,  AND STARTING AROUND 2004, 2005, THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE DRONE  STRIKES, TARGETED KILLINGS.
Jon:  BECAUSE THEY FOUND  OUT ABOUT THE INTERROGATIONS AND  SAID WE SHOULD DO THAT.
WELL, THERE WAS A LOT OF  INTERNAL DEBATE INSIDE THE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION. THERE WAS AN INTERNAL C.I.A. REPORT THAT CHRONICLED SOME OF  THE ABUSES IN THE C.I.A. PRISONS. AND, OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF  CONGRESSIONAL SCRUTINY OF THE  PROGRAM. AND SO AS THAT HAPPENS, THERE  WAS A NEW STRATEGY STARTED TO  EVOLVE WHERE BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAD BEEN CHEERING  SOME OF THE TARGETED KILLING AND  DRONE STRIKES. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE  POLITICALLY PALATABLE IN A WAY.
Jon:  AND IT WAS SECRET,  YET, SOMEHOW IN THE GIFT SHOP OF  THE C.I.A., THIS IS A SECRET PROGRAM, WHAT WERE THEY SELLING?
THEY WERE SELLING GOLF SHIRT  WITH PREDATORS ON THEM.
Jon:  PREDATOR DRONES.
YES.
Jon:  EVEN THOUGH THAT  WAS A SECRET PROGRAM NO ONE WAS  SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT.
WELL, IT'S A SECRET GIFT  SHOP. ( LAUGHTER ). THEY DON'T JUST LET ANYONE IN  BUT THEY STILL-- YEAH.
Jon:  I DID NOT REALIZE  THE GIFT SHOP ITSELF WAS SECRET.
YES.
Jon:  WHERE DID YOU GO  THAT? I CANNOT TELL YOU. HOW-- HAVE THESE ALL DEVELOPED  WITH ANY OVERSIGHT? AND IS THERE ANY CONVERSATION  BETWEEN THE D.O.D. AND C.I.A.? YOU WRITE THAT THEY HAVE  SEPARATE KILL LISTS.
SO IF YOU LOOK AT YEMEN RIGHT  NOW, YOU HAVE BOTH THE PENTAGON  AND THE C.I.A. ARE RUNNING PARALLEL DRONE WARS WITH  SEPARATE KILL LISTS, AND UNDER  DIFFERENT AUTHORITIES. SO FOR THE-- AND THIS, ALSO,  THEY ANSWERED TO DIFFERENT PARTS  OF CONGRESS WHO, YOU KNOW, ARE TRYING TO DO THE OVERSIGHT. SO AN OUTSIDER AS A REPORTER  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE  DIFFERENCE, WHY ARE THERE THESE PARALLEL PROGRAMS IS QUITE  DIFFICULT?
Jon:  IS IT LIKE  GLENGARRY GLENN ROSS, WHERE  THEY'RE LIKE, YOU HAVE TO KILL MORE PEOPLE. THE GUY WHO COMES IN SECOND GETS  STEAK KNIVES, THIRD IS FIRED. ARE THEY COMPETING WITH EACH  OTHER? THERE'S AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT RIGHT  NOW I THINK IN THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION THAT THE SYSTEM IS WAY TOO HAPHAZARD. AND WHAT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE  LAST 11-PLUS YEARS HAS EVOLVED  ON THE FLY, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO WORK UP ON THE SOME SORT OF,  SORT OF RULES, TO SORT OF  DETERMINE FOR THE FUTURE, AND AS PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID ON THIS  SHOW, WE NEED RULES TO RESTRAIN  ME, AND RESTRAIN FUTURE PRESIDENTS FROM BEING SORT OF  SEDUCED BY SECRET WAR.
Jon:  YEAH, THAT WAS A  SURPRISING THING WHEN HE SAID  THAT. STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT  AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT  HAPPENS WITH THE C.I.A. PROGRAMS. "THE WAY OF THE KNIFE."  IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES RIGHT  NOW. MARK MAZZETTI, EVERYBO
