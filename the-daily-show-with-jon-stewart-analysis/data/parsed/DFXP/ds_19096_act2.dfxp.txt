Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, THE NRA IS NOT THE ONLY ORGANIZATION SPEAKING UP FOR INNOCENT GUN OWNERS. JORDAN KLEPPER IS OUT THERE RESEARCHING ANOTHER GROUP THAT HAS THEIR INTEREST IN MIND.
AS STAND YOUR GROUND LAWS PROLIFERATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND CONTROVERSIAL SELF DEFENSE SHOOTINGS MAKE HEADLINES PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO SPEAK UP ABOUT THE HEARTBREAKING DAMAGES THESE EVENTS CAUSE. BUT, WHO WILL SPEAK FOR THE REAL VICTIMS OF SHOOTINGS, THE SHOOTERS?
AFTER SHOOTING IT'S TRAGIC WHEN SOMEONE IS FORCED TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO PAY THE LEGAL BILLS TO DEAL WITH THE TRIAL.
GUN RIGHTS ADVOCATE JIM IRVINE IS SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF SHOOTING PEOPLE.
THE TRAUMA OF ACQUITTAL DEFENSE OR CIVIL DEFENSE AFTER A SHOOTING CAN DESTROY FAMILIES.
FINANCIALLY?
FINANCIALLY.
THANKFULLY KEN CUCCINELLI THE FORMER REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR VIRGINIA GOVERNOR HAS A MUCH NEEDED SOLUTION.
WHAT WE'RE DOING, FOR A LOW MONTHLY COST IF YOU ARE CHARGED WITH OFFENSES WHEN YOU ARE A LEGAL GUN OWNER WE'LL BE YOUR LAWYER. IF A SERIOUS INCIDENT HAPPENS WE'LL BE THERE TO DEFEND YOU.
AND BY INCIDENT YOU MEAN SHOOTING SOMEBODY.
WE'RE THERE TO PROTECT OUR CLIENTS AFTER THAT HAPPENS.
HOW MUCH DOES THIS PLAN COST?
ONE PERSON CAN GET IT FOR AS LOW AS LESS THAN $10 A MONTH.
I MEAN, PRICES LIKE THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO SHOOT ANYONE. GOD BLESS YOU, CUCH. AND, HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE HELPING. SERVICES LIKE CUCCINELLI'S ARE POPPING UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. BUT SOME PEOPLE, LIKE CAROLYN ELEPHANT, THINK THERE'S A DANGEROUS FLAW WITH THESE PLANS.
THE PROBLEM IS IF NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR THE PLANS THE RISK POOL IS GOING TO BE TOO SMALL. YOU NEED TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS WITH LOWER RISKS SO THAT YOU CAN BRING DOWN THE COST FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS.
YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE A BUNCH OF CLIENTS WITH PREEXISTING INTENTIONS TO KILL SOMEONE?
YEAH, THAT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE THINGS MORE RISKY FOR THE FIRM.
IN A CRUEL TWIST OF FATE KEN CUCINELLI FACES THE PROBLEM AS AS THE HEALTH CARE REFORM THAT AS A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE HE HAD PLEDGED TO STOP. BUT WHERE OBAMACARE NEEDS THE YOUNG AND HEALTHY, HIS PLAN NEEDS THOSE WHO DON'T CONSTANTLY FANTASIZE ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE. IN ORDER TO HELP, I TOOK A PAGE OUT OF THE OBAMACARE PLAYBOOK AND WENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE. CAN I TALK TO YOU ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE? WHEREVER THEY WERE. BOOM, I'M AN ATTACKER. I LIKE YOUR RESPONSE. YOU DIDN'T PULL A GUN OUT ON ME WHICH MEANS YOU ARE LOW RISK AND I THINK YOU WOULD BE A PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT HERE.
I HAVE SOMEWHERE TO BE. [LAUGHTER]
OH, MY GOD.
I'M A HOME INVADER. EVERYBODY HAS TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE IN CASE THEY SHOOT SOMEONE IN THE FUTURE.
GET OUT OF HERE I SAID. PLEASE -- ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
CAN I HELP YOU.
DO YOU FANTASIZE ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE?
NO, DO YOU HAVE $8 A MONTH?
YES.
I WOULD LOVE TO COME IN. YOU RUN INTO THIS PERSON ON THE STREET WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
FREEZE.
YOU ARE GOING TO SHOOT. THIS GUY? YOU'RE GOING TO SHOOT.
NO, NOTHING. HE LOOKS NICE WHY WOULD I SHOOT HIM.
THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SHOOT SOMEONE MAKES YOU THE PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR INSURANCE FOR SHOOTING SOMEONE.
I CAN'T SHOOT SOMEONE. I DON'T HAVE A GUN.
YOU DON'T HAVE A GUN?
NO.
I HAD FAILED. I HAD TO WARN CUCINELLI. THIS IS THE EXACT SAME CHALLENGE THAT OBAMACARE IS FACING.
YEAH, EXCEPT WE DO OURS WITHOUT COMPELLING ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING. WE LIKE THE CONSTITUTION. SO, THERE'S A MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO THERE.
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. DO YOU THINK YOU WILL MOVE ON TO ANOTHER ISSUE LIKE PROTECTING PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK FROM GOING BANKRUPT?
I THINK WE WOULD PROBABLY MOVE ON TO PROTECTING GUN OWNERS IN MARYLAND AND THEN NORTH CAROLINA IN ADDITION TO VIRGINIA.
OF COURSE, I'M SORRY, THERE'S STILL STATES OUT THERE WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO SHOOT OTHER PEOPLE.
IT'S A SITUATION WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.
SO REST WELL, AMERICA. IT'S GETTING SAFER TO SHOOT EVERY DAY.
Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
