[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ON  THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN  RELATIONS. A CASE FOR PUTTING AMERICA'S  HOUSE IN ORDER. PLEASE WELCOME RICHARD HAASS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: FOREIGN POLICY BEGINS  AT HOME BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR IT  DOESN'T STAY THERE, DOES IT?
THAT IS NOT THE PRESCRIPTION  FOR THIS BOOK. THIS IS MORE LIKE AN EXERCISE  MANUAL FOR AMERICA TO WORK ON  ITS CORE.
STRATEGIC PLOTTING. John: IT MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE  MUCH BUT THAT'S WHERE THE REAL  POWER COMES FROM.
IN THE LONG RUN WE CAN'T  CHASE THE WORLD UNLESS WE HAVE  TO SET AN EXAMPLE. IN THE LONG RUN WE HAVE TO BE  STRONG AT HOME. IT'S NOT ABOUT ISOLATIONISM BUT  A PRESCRIPTION FOR LONG-TERM  AMERICAN LEADERSHIP.
John: THIS IS A SURPRISING  BOOK COMING FROM YOU. SOMEONE HAS RESPONSIBILITY THEIR  WHOLE LIFE IN FOREIGN POLICY.
HERE I AM ON THE COUNCIL OF  FOREIGN RELATIONS. I SPENT MY WHOLE CAREER WORKING  ON FOREIGN POLICY AND WHAT I'M  SAYING IS THERE'S TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON THE FOREIGN POLICY  SIDE NOT ENOUGH ON THE DOMESTIC. IT'S NOT AN END IN ITSELF. BUT WE HAVE TO DO MORE HERE SO  WE CAN DO MORE THERE.
John: THIS IS TRULY SOMETHING  THAT IS IN FACT AMERICA'S  FOREIGN POLICY OR THROWING MONEY AT THE PROBLEM. WE SEE THAT HAPPENING NOW IN  EGYPT. LET'S JUST APPLY THIS BOOK TO  EGYPT. YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW AMERICA  MAY BE BETTER OFF WITH EVOLUTION  OR REVOLUTION, WHICH RHYMES SO IT DEFINITELY CARRIES SOME  WEIGHT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.
THE MIDDLE EAST NO LONGER  SHOULD DOMINATE AMERICA'S  FOREIGN POLICY. IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN A PLACE  LIKE EGYPT WE OUGHT TO BE SAYING  IF YOU WANT OUR SUPPORT, YOU HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN CONDITIONS:  ECONOMIC REFORM, POLITICAL  REFORM. YOU CAN'T INSIST BUT YOU CAN SAY  HERE'S THE INCENTIVE AND HERE'S  THE PENALTY IF YOU DON'T DO IT.
John: THERE'S A SITUATION NOW  WHERE WE... THE MILITARY SEEMS  TO HAVE... NO ONE IS SAYING THAT MORSI WAS A PARTICULARLY GOOD  MAN. BUT JUST TO HAVE A FOREIGN  POLICY IN PLACE.
THE DIFFERENCE IS WHAT  HAPPENS IN EGYPT IS THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND  ELECTIONS. MORSI WON AN ELECTION BUT HE  DIDN'T RULE BUT THE UNITED  STATES IS BASICALLY SAYING, IF YOU DECLARE A COUPs, YOU HAVE  TO STOP. YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT THE  MILITARY WILL START GOING DOWN A  PATH OF DEMOCRACY. YOU WANT TO AVOID USING THE  LANGUAGE. IF THE MILITARY ALLOWS... FOR  EXAMPLE, THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD  IS IS ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN  POLITICS.
John: ALSO ANOTHER  PRESCRIPTION MORE SPECIFIC. WE'RE SAYING WSHED NOT HAVE  DEMOCRACY OVERSEAS. NOW THAT SEEMS VERY STRAIGHT  COMING FROM AN AMERICAN WHO ALSO  WORKS FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE ABSOLUTELY SPREAD  DEMOCRACY LIKE A CROP SPRAYER.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE  DONE IS EVEN THOUGH WE'RE THE  MOST POWERFUL IN THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE LOCAL ECONOMICS AND  LOCAL RELIGION. WHEN WE TRIED TO REMAKE IRAQ AND  AFGHANISTAN, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS  WERE SPENT, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT TO SHOW FOR  IT. IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF  HUMILITY, SOME UNDERSTANDING. IT HAS REPERCUSSIONS FOR WHAT WE  DO AND ALSO WHAT WE DON'T DO.
YOU ALSO LOOK IN TERMS OF OUR  FOREIGN POLICY AND NEGATING  THINGS AT HOME YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE ASKED TROOPS TO DO OVERSEAS  IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, WE'VE  ASKED THEM TO WORK IN WHAT SEEMS DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE PERFECT  MODEL FOR THE DISCREPANCY HERE.
WE HAVE PROBLEMS. THEY NEED JOBS AND ACCESS TO  ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE TO PUT MORE RESOURCES  INTO THAT. THE COUNTRY WILL BE STABLE AND  PROSPEROUS AND WE'LL HAVE MORE  THAN ENOUGH LEFT OVER TO CONTINUE THE CASE. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE DOING THINGS  OVERSEAS. IF WE DON'T DO IT NO ONE ELSE  WILL. NO ONE ELSE IS WILLING AND ABLE  TO TAKE ON THE LEADERSHIP.
John: WE NEED TO PAY MORE  ATTENTION.
WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT HERE. LIKE EISENHOWER AND OTHERS  NATIONAL SECURITY NOT JUST  FOREIGN POLICY. THERE HAS TO BE ECONOMIC  SECURITY AND ECONOMIC STRENGTH.
John: STICK AROUND. THERE'S MORE TO TALK ABOUT. FOREIGN POLICY BEGINS AT HOME. ON THE BOOK SHELVES N
