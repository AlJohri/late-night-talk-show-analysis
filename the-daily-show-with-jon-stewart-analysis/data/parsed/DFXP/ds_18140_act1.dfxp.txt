FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN  NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,  MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER. I'M STILL HERE FOR JON  STEWART WHO IS SPENDING THE  SUMMER FULFILLING THE TERMS  OF HIS CRAZY UNCLE'S WILL BY SPENDING THE WHOLE TIME IN A  HAUNTED HOUSE. HE DOESN'T LIKE G-G-G  GOSSES. MY JEST A JUNIOR SENATOR  FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK,  KIRSTEN GUILT HE BRAND WILL BE WITH US. BUT FIRST WE START TONIGHT  WITH MEMORIES. WHO REMEMBERS WHEN THE WALL  STREET BANKERS TURNED OUR  FINANCIAL SYSTEM INTO A FREE WILLING CASINO WITH A GLOBAL  CRASH IN WHICH OUR MONEY  DISAPPEARED. DO YOU REMEMBER? YEAH, YEAH. I REMEMBER THAT TOO. WELL, GUESS WHAT? THE CHICKENS ARE FINALLY  COMING HOME TO ROOST.
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE  ANNOUNCED TODAY IT IS GOING  AFTER BANK OF AMERICA, DOJ SAYS AMERICA'S SECOND  LARGEST BANK LIED ABOUT THE  RISKINESS OF 850 MILLION  DOLLARS IN SHARES OF HOME LOANS THAT WERE SOLD TO  INVESTORS.
ANOTHER BIG BANK COULD BE  FACING TROUBLE FROM THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
JPMORGAN CHASE REPORTS  THAT A PRELIMINARY JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATION FOUND THE BANK DID INDEED  BREAK THE LAW WHILE SELLING  RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BONDS FROM 2005 TO 2007.
YES! ACCOUNTABILITY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE GOT THEM, BABY! WHOOO!
ACCOUNTABILITY.
YES! YES, SURE, JUSTICE HAS BEEN  A LONG TIME COMING BUT THAT  IS JUST GOING TO MAKE IT ALL THE SWEETER NOW. SO LET'S START WITH BANK OF  AMERICA. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO  JAIL? AND JUST FOR THE SAKE OF  SIMPLICITY ROUND IT UP TO  THE NEAREST 100.
THIS IS A CIVIL SUIT SO  NO ONE IS GOING TO JAIL. (LAUGHTER)  NO ONE, REALLY? THAT'S-- NOW I'M TO THE  GOING TO BE NEEDING THESE  CELEBRATION DOVES I WAS  GOING TO RELEASE. (LAUGHTER)  WE DIDN'T DRILL HOLES IN THE  BOX-- HOLD ON, HOLD ON, NO,  THERE'S A NOTE TO. TO WHOMEVER FINDS US. I THINK IT WAS A SUICIDE. THE LACK OF WALL STREET  ACCOUNTABILITY IS COMPLETE  BULL [BLEEP]. WE CAN'T GO ON, LOVE THE  DOVES. COME ON. IS THIS-- I'M SORRY, DOVES. I'M SORRY. I'M DISAPPOINTED TOO. IS THIS REALLY ANY SURPRISE,  THOUGH. EVERY TIME REGULATOR DOES GO  AFTER WALL STREET IT ALWAYS  ENDS THE SAME WAY.
PART OF A SETTLEMENT  JPMORGAN DID NOT ADMIT OR  DENY WRONGDOING.
CITIBANK DENIES ANY  WRONGDOING BUT SAYS IT WAS  IN THE BANG'S BEST INTEREST TO SETTLE.
UBS DID NOT ADMIT  WRONGDOING.
GOLDMAN SACHS SETTLED  EARLY WITHOUT ADMITTING  WRONGDOING.
SETTLED. SO IT SEEMS WALL STREET  REGULATION IS REALLY JUST  LIKE THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE  PROCESS. NO ONE GOES TO JAIL AND IT  ALL ENDS WITH A BUNCH OF  HALF ASSED SETTLEMENTS THAT SEEM TO MAKE EVERYONE ANGRY. (APPLAUSE)
SO WE MIGHT NOT GET THE  EMOTIONAL CLOSURE OF HAVING  THEM ADMIT WHAT THEY DID OR THE PHYSICAL CLOSURE OF  HAVING THEM GO TO JAIL SO  HOW ABOUT SOME FINANCIAL  JUSTICE. CAN WE AT LEAST HIT THEM  WHERE IT HURTS.
GOLDMAN SACHS THE GIANT  WALL STREET FIRM HAS AGREED  TO PAY $550 MILLION IN A SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC.
OKAY, THAT'S NOT NOTHING,  HALF A BILLION DOLLARS, I  DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE, THAT HAS GOT TO HURT.
550 MILLION, BY THE WAY,  IS ABOUT THREE DAYS REVENUE  FOR GOLDMAN.
THREE DAYS? A STOMACH FLU LASTS LONGER  THAN THREE DAYS. IF FEDERAL REGULATORS REALLY  WANTED TO PUNISH THE BANKERS  THEY WOULD HAVE SKIPPED THE FINE ALL TOGETHER AND JUST  FED THEM SOME OLD SUSHI  INSTEAD. (LAUGHTER)  ARE WE SOMEHOW SUPPOSED TO  FEEL SATISFIED WITH THIS  KIND OF JUSTICE? BECAUSE THIS FEELS LIKE, UM,  YEAH, WHAT'S ANOTHER ANALOGY  T FEELS LIKE THE BANKING EQUIVALENT OF HEY, I DON'T  KNOW WHO GAVE HER THAT BLACK  EYE BUT I'M A NICE GUY SO HERE'S 20 BUCKS, GO BUY SOME  MAKEUP. THESE SETTLEMENTS MUST HAVE  FELT LIKE A HOLLOW VICTORY  FOR FEDERAL REGULATORS.
TODAY SETTLEMENT IS A  STARK REMINDER, A VERY STARK  REMINDER THAT THERE WILL BE A HEAVY PRICE TO BE PAID IF  FIRMS VIOLATE THE  PRINCIPLESES FUNDAMENTAL TO  THE SECURITIES LAWS.
TODAY'S SETTLEMENT SENDS  A POWERFUL MESSAGE OF  DETERANCE AND ACCOUNT  ABLINGTED.
WAIT, YOU SETTLED. AND NOW YOU'RE BRAGGING  ABOUT IT, SETTLING IS NOT  SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF. SETTLING IS SOMETHING YOU DO  WHEN YOU BIOLOGICAL CLOCK IS  TICKING AND YOU'RE SICK OF DATING --
SURE, SURE, HE'S NOT BRAD  PITT BUT HE HAS A JOB AND MY  DOG LIKES HIM. BESIDES, I'VE JUST GIVEN UP. THE SETTLEMENT TERMS FOR  THESE BANKERS ARE PRETTY  ATTRACTIVE. IT'S FRANKLY NO WONDER THAT  NO ONE WANTS TO HAVE THEIR  DAY IN COURT. WELL, ALMOST NO ONE.
A JURY HAS DECIDED THAT A  FORMER WALL STREET TRADER  SHOULD PAY FOR HIS ROLE IN THE TOXIC MORTGAGE CRISIS  THAT WAS AS MUCH A BIG PART  OF THE FINANCIAL MELTDOWN. HE IS FABRICE, A 34 YEAR OLD  FRENCH BORN FORMER GOLDMAN  SACHS TRADER.
HE CALLS HIMSELF FABULOUS  FAB.
WHAT?
FABULOUS FAB, LIKE ARE  YOU IN CIRQUE DU SOLEIL. AND I DO HOPE YOU CHECKED  THE DRAG QUEEN REGISTRATION  WEB SITE TO SEE IF THAT NAME WAS EVEN AVAILABLE AT THE  MOMENT. AND FRANKLY, I DID NOT KNOW  THAT YOU WERE EVEN ALLOWED  TO PICK YOUR OWN NICK NAME. NO ONE TOLD ME THAT WAS AN  OPTION. SO WITH THAT IN MIND FROM  NOW ON YOU MAY ADDRESS ME AS  JUG MASTER JOHNNY FRESH. YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OKAY ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW  WHAT, THAT'S A BIT OF A  MOUTHFUL. LET'S GO WITH JUICY JOHNNIE,  NO, I TAKE THAT BACK, THAT'S  TOO SEXY. I'VE GOT IT CARLOS DANGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DANGER.
NO, THAT NAME IS  AVAILABLE, HE'S PROMISED  HE'S NOT USING IT ANY MORE. STILL, I GUESS AT LEAST WE  HAVE ONE GUY, AND HE'S A  VICE PRESIDENT, SO EVEN IF  HE DIDN'T TAKE DOWN THE COMPANY WE GOT THE NUMBER  TWO. WHAT? GOLDMAN SACHS VICE PRESIDENT,  BY THE WAY THEY'VE GOT ABOUT  12,000 OF THEM OVER THERE --
HOLY [BLEEP], 12,000 VICE  PRESIDENTS? ALL PRESUMABLY WITH  DIFFERENT RIDICULOUS NICK  NAMES. APPARENTLY YOU CAN'T WALK  INTO GOLDMAN AND THROW A PEN  WITHOUT HITTING A VICE  PRESIDENT. BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU HIT THE  JANITOR YOU WILL BE HITTING  THE VICE PRESIDENT IN CHARGE OF URINAL CAKE OR AS HE  INSISTS ON BEING CALLED  SCRUBTASTIC STEVE. BUT AT LEAST FABULOUS  FABRICE IS GOING TO JAIL,  RIGHT?
A JURY FOUND FORMER  GOLDMAN TRADER FABRICE  LIABLE ON SIX AND SEVEN. CIVIL COUNTS FOR FRAUD THE  AND A POTENTIAL IS LIFE BAN  FROM THE SECURITIES  INDUSTRY.
A LIFETIME BAN FROM THE  SECURITIES INDUSTRY,  SHOULDN'T HE AT LEAST HAVE TO STAY A THOUSAND FEET AWAY  FROM WALL STREET? AND INTRODUCE HIMSELF  DOOR-TO-DOOR WHENEVER HE  MOVES TO ANY TOWN THAT HAS A  BANK? JUST-- HELLO, MY NAME IS  FABRICE AND I'M A REGISTERED  DERIVATIVES OFFENDER. (APPLAUSE)
LOOK, I GUESS IF IT'S  JUST THE BEST WE CAN HOPE  FOR, FINES THAT ARE  ESSENTIALLY ROLL MOOD THE BANK'S COST OF DOING  BUSINESS ALONG WITH THEIR  BUDGET FOR TONNER CARTRIDGES  OR COCAINE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT AT LEAST NOW THEY KNOW  THAT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE  WATCHING THEM AND IT WILL BE AWHILE BEFORE THEY DARE TO  BEHAVE SO BADLY AGAIN.
BANKS ARE BEHAVING BADLY  AGAIN. THAT'S ACCORDING TO A LETTER  FROM THE NEW YORK STATE  ATTORNEY GENERAL. LAST YEAR FIVE BANKS AGREED  TO PAY OUT $25 BILLION AS  PART OF A SETTLEMENT  DESIGNED TO PUT A STOP TO MORTGAGE AND FORECLOSURE  ABUSE. SCHNEIDERMAN SAYS SOME OF  THE BANKS ARE QUOTE ENGAGING  IN MUCH OF THE SAME  MISCONDUCT THAT PRECIPITATED THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE  SETTLEMENTS.
AND WE'RE BACK TO WHERE  WE STARTED. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PERFECT  ANALOGY FOR THIS IS? OUR FINANCIAL REGULATORY  SYSTEM IS LIKE 50 SHADES OF  GREY. YOU CAN'T HURT THEM BECAUSE  THEY LIKE IT. AND WE JUST KEEP GETTING
