FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [ Applause ]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. I'M EXCITED WE HAVE GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT MY GUEST, "SELMA" DIRECTOR AVA DUVERNAY, AND THIS MOVIE IS PHENOMENAL. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT. WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE HER. BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW -- I THINK WE'D ALL AGREE 2014 WAS NOT A GREAT YEAR FOR PEOPLE. BUT I THINK THE HOPE WAS THAT 2015 WOULD BRING SORT OF A RESPITE FROM THE KINDS OF TERRIBLE EVENTS THAT HAVE BECOME ALL TOO FAMILIAR FOR US. BUT, BUT -- OUR HEARTS ARE WITH THE STAFF OF CHARLIE HEBDO AND THEIR FAMILIES TONIGHT. I KNOW VERY FEW PEOPLE GO INTO TO COMEDY, YOU KNOW, AS AN ACT OF COURAGE MAINLY BECAUSE IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT. IT SHOULDN'T BE AN ACT OF COURAGE. IT SHOULD BE TAKEN AS ESTABLISHED LAW. BUT THOSE GUYS AT HEBDO HAD IT, AND THEY WERE KILLED FOR THEIR CARTOONS. STARK REMINDER THAT FOR THE MOST PART THE LEGISLATORS AND JOURNALISTS AND INSTITUTIONS THAT WE JAB AND RIDICULE ARE NOT IN ANY WAY THE ENEMY. FOR HOWEVER FRUSTRATING OR OUTRAGED THE BACK AND FORTH CAN BECOME IT'S STILL A BACK AND FORTH A CONVERSATION AMONGST THOSE ON LET'S CALL IT TEAM CIVILIZATION. AND THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE ONLY CLARIFIES THAT REALITY. BUT OF COURSE, OF COURSE OUR GOAL TONIGHT IS NOT TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS BECAUSE THERE IS NO SENSE TO BE MADE OF THIS. OUR GOAL AS IT IS ALWAYS IS TO KEEP GOING. KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON OR WHATEVER VERSION OF THAT SAYING IS IN YOUR DORM ROOM. WE SPENT THE MAJORITY OF OUR DAY HONESTLY IN SHOCK AND GRIEF BUT ALSO SEARCHING FOR A SEGUE. BACK IN TO A PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS. AND YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE IT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE FOUND IT, IT'S A STORY THAT COMBINES DIFFICULTY OF RIDDING SOCIETY OF THESE TYPES OF PERSISTENT, TOXIC IDEOLOGIES. IT COMBINES THAT WITH A CREATURE THAT HAS FOUR STOMACHS. WE MOVE FORWARD TONIGHT WITH A SEGMENT WE CALL NAZI COWS.
A BRITISH FARMER HAS HAD TO PUT DOWN MOST OF HIS CATTLE HERD BECAUSE APPARENTLY THEY WERE TOO AGGRESSIVE.
KNOWN AS NAZI COWS, THEY WERE ORIGINALLY BRED AS A MASTER RACE OF BELLIGERENT BOVINES. [ Laughter ]
YOU KNOW, IF YOU SEARCH LONG ENOUGH IN A PILE OF HORSE [BLEEP] OUR GOING TO FIND A HORSE. NAZI COWS. BY THE WAY IS THAT REALLY THE MOST EVOCATIVE IMAGE WE CAN HAVE FOR THIS? THERE YOU GO. COMEDY! NAZI COWS! NOW COWS! WHO ARE NAZIS! AND BY THE WAY WE'RE NOT JUST CALLING THESE NAZI COWS THE WAY SEINFELD HAD, SEINFELD HAD SOUP NAZI OR LINDA IN H.R. IS A REAL NAZI ABOUT GETTING YOUR TIMESHEET FILLED OUT PROPERLY. THESE COWS ARE ACTUAL NAZIS.
THE HECK CATTLE WERE DELIBERATELY CREATED BY NAZI GENETIC EXPERTS. KEEN HUNTSMAN, HERMANN GORING HERE WANTED AN ICONIC AND AGGRESSIVE BREED WHICH COULD ROAM FREELY ACROSS EUROPE LIKE THE AUROCHS OF OLD.
HERMANN GOERING AUROCH-LIKE NAZI COWS! SOUNDS LIKE THE ABSOLUTE WORST POSSIBLE KNOCKOFF OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES FRANCHISE. [ Laughter ] NOW YOU MAY ASSUME NAZI COWS, LIKE ALL COWS, WOULD BE EASY TO GET RID OF. WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE SLEEPING SEND IN TIP TEAM SIX. AND UH -- WHAT I'M SAYING IS THESE COWS ARE NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.
IF I WAS STANDING HERE AND SOME OF THE MORE AGGRESSIVE ONES WERE IN THIS FIELD AND THEY COULD SEE ME,  THEN THEY WOULD COME RIGHT ACROSS NOW AND TRY TO KILL YOU.
TRY TO KILL YOU?
OH ABSOLUTELY, YES. YEAH. THEY HAVE EVERY INTENTION OF WIPING YOU FROM THE FACE OF THIS EARTH.
THAT'S HOW DELUSIONAL THESE TYPES OF IDEOLOGIES ARE. THE NAZIS WERE DEFEATED MANY, MANY YEARS AGO. IT'S 2015, THEY'RE IN A PEN, THEY'RE [BLEEP] COWS. THEY DON'T HAVE THUMBS. AND THEY STILL THINK THEY CAN WIN THE SECOND WORLD WAR. WHAT DIABOLICAL SCHEME DID HITLER HAVE PLANNED FOR THESE UBER-MOOO-NSCHES?
THE IDEA OF GREEK HEROES LIKE HERCULES WRESTLING THE AUROCHS IS SORT OF WRIT LARGE IN CLASSICAL MYTHOLGY AND THE NAZIS WANTED A PART OF THAT. YOU KNOW, THEY WANTED THE NAZI SUPERMEN TO BE ABLE, TO SORT OF, YOU KNOW BEST THEMSELVES AGAINST THESE KIND OF CREATURES IN A SORT OF POST WAR GERMANY.
Jon: LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE HAS POINTED THIS OUT BEFORE, BUT THE NAZIS OBVIOUSLY WERE A LITTLE CUCKOO. I MEAN, LET'S BREED A RACE OF SUPER COWS IS CRAZY. LET'S BREED A RACE OF SUPER COWS SO WE CAN WRESTLE THEM IS A WHOLE OTHER PLANET OF NUTS. IT STRIKES ME, PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED, WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF HITLER HAD WON THE WAR, WELL, NOW WE KNOW CHANNING TATUM WOULD BE STARRING IN A VERY DIFFERENT MOVIE. YOU KNOW, THE IMPORTANT THING IS -- [ Laughter ] FOR MORE, AND YOU'LL SEE WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS. FOR MORE ON THESE IRRATIONALLY VIOLENT COWS WE GO TO SENIOR MOOSLUM CORRESPONDENT, AASIF MANDVI IN ENGLAND. AASIF, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. AASIF, WHAT, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
WELL, JON, THE WAY I SEE IT THE COWS BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COWS, RIGHT?
Jon: RIGHT.
YEAH. ARE BY NATURE PEACEFUL ANIMALS. AND THEN YOU GET THESE CRAZY ONES WITH THIS VIOLENT OUTDATED IDEOLOGY.
Jon: YEAH, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?
WHY IS MY JOB TO EXPLAIN THAT? OKAY, WHY DO I HAVE TO ANSWER FOR EVERY COW OUT THERE? OKAY? I DON'T LIKE NAZI COWS ANY MORE THAN YOU DO, JON.
Jon:  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COWS.
YES.
Jon: OKAY.
COWS.
Jon: I MEAN, THIS TYPE OF STORY MUST BE TOUGH ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE WORLD. COWS.
COWS. YEAH.
Jon: WHO ARE NOT NAZI COWS JUST WANT TO SIT THERE, LIVE THEIR LIVES, CHEW THEIR CUD.
YEAH. YEAH.  IT'S [BLEEP] SUCKS.
Jon: YEAH, I GET IT.
I MEAN, WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO ARGUE AGAINST THESE FANATICAL BEASTS? I MEAN, IS IT MINE? AM I BEING A COW-ARD?
Jon:  IS THAT, IS THAT WHERE THE WORD COMES FROM?
YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE.
Jon: AASIF, CERTAINLY THE ACTS PERPETRATED BY THESE COWS ARE HORRIFYING. BUT THIS IS TAKING PLACE IN EUROPE. DO WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED HERE IN THE STATES?
JON, NAZI COWS ARE ATTACKING PEOPLE. DOES IT MATTER WHERE IT'S HAPPENING OR WHY? SURE. NAZI COWS ALWAYS HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR WHY THEY DO THE CRAZY THINGS THEY DO, OH, YOU PULLED MY UDDER TOO HARD. OR OH, THE GRASS IS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE. OR, OH IF ENGLAND HADN'T MILKED US IN 1919. YOU CANNOT REASON WITH THEM. YOU CANNOT APPEASE THEM. THEY'RE NAZIS. AND COWS. THEY'RE NAZI COWS.
Jon:  I SEE. SO PERHAPS IN THIS SITUATION THE WORLD JUST HAS TO STAND TOGETHER. THE VAST MAJORITY OF US AND JUST SAY, BAD COW.
YEAH.
Jon: DON'T DO THAT.
RIGHT. WELL, THE ONLY SOLACE IS FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND I DO BELIEVE THIS FIGHT IS WINNABLE.
IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE AGGRESSIVE CATTLE THAT HAD TO BE DESTROYED THE ANSWER IS, BURGERS AND SAUSAGES.
Jon: ALOST MAKES YOU FEEL BAD FOR THEM.
NO, NOT REALLY. JON.
THANK YOU, AASIF. AASIF MANDVI, IN ENGLAND TONIGHT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
