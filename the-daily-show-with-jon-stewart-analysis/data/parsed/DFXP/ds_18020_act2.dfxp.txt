REAL QUICK, THESE ARE JUST SOME  SENATE AND HOUSE AS YOU REMEMBER  MCCASKILL IS GOING UP AGAINST TODD AKIN. IT LOOKS LIKE IN MISSOURI MA  MCCASKILL HAS LEGIT ME RAPED  TODD AKIN. ELECTORALLY SPEAKING OBVIOUSLY. IN INDIANA JOE DONNELLY HAS  DEFEATED RICHARD MURDOCK, THE  REPUBLICAN. THAT IS A DEMOCRATIC PICK UP. AND IN ILLINOIS THIS IS  INTERESTING, TAMMY DO YOU DO YOU  RECOLLECT -- DUCK WORTH HAS DEFEATED JOE WALSH. SO THAT'S ANOTHER BIG ONE. BY THE WAY YOU WANT TO KEEP IN  MIND THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE RACE. THE FIRST PERSON TO 270 WINS THE  ABILITY TO BOMB IRAN. AND RIGHT NOW OBAMA IS AT 243  AND MITT ROMNEY IS AT 203. SO KEEP YOUR EYE ON THAT. [CROWD CHEERING] DONATIONS TRICKLING IN FOR THE  PRESIDENTIAL RACE. IT'S MAGICAL, THANK A LOT GUYS  THANKS FOR JOINING US. TONIGHT'S RESULTS, GUYS, WHAT DO  YOU THINK.
JON TONIGHT'S RESULTS HAVE  CAUSED A SEISMIC SHIFT? WHAT WE'RE FORECASTING FOR THE  2016 ELECTION. THE REAL WINNER TONIGHT LOOKS TO  BE HILLARY CLINTON WHO IS NOW  PROJECTING PAT 68% CHANCE OF VICTORY --
[CROWD CHEERING]
THAT'S UP FROM 54% JUST A FEW  HOURS AGO. OBVIOUSLY PREMATURE TO CALL THE  2016 ELECTION BUT I THINK  THROUGH DEMANDS WE HAVE AT LEAST EXAMINED SOME VICE PRESIDENTIAL  OPTIONS. TONIGHT MITT ROMNEY RECEIVED  VERY LITTLE MINORITY SUPPORT. WE'RE TALKING JIMMY BUFFET  CONCERT LEVEL. SO THAT'S CLEARLY GOING TO HAVE  TO PUT SOME COFFEE IN THAT  CREAM. WOULDN'T HURT TO COUNTER HILLARY  WITH A WOMAN EITHER. SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING  CONDALEESA RICE OR PERHAPS  MEDEA.
NO JON THE CHARACTER FROM  GREEK TRAGEDY WHO MURDERS BOTH  OF HER CHILDREN. THAT MEDEA.
Jon:  WHAT ABOUT HILLARY'S  VICE PRESIDENT.
SHE'LL NEED TO REACH OLDER  WHITE MALE VOTERS. SO THE TWO LEADING VP CONTENDERS  ARE A 1962 CHEVY EMPALA AND A  CAN OF BEER.
Jon:  I UNDERSTAND.
LASTLY IN 2016 WITH THE  UNITED STATES SPLIT INTO TWO  TERRITORIES, NEW REAL AMERICA.
Jon:  WAIT LET ME GUESS THE  BLUE STATES ARE NOW THE UNITED  STATES OF OVERSENSITIVITY.
THAT'S NOT FUNNY, JON.
Jon:  IT'S A LITTLE FUNNY.
NO THAT'S ACTUALLY THE NAME  OF THE NEW BLUE STATE COUNTRY. THAT'S NOT FUNNY, JON.
THEY KNEW YOU WOULD MAKE FUN  OF THEM.
Jon:  I DIDN'T REALIZE  THAT.
2016 ONCE AGAIN AND I KNOW  THIS SOUNDS CRAZY IT'S GOING TO  COME DOWN TO OHIO OR AS IT'S KNOWN IN ITS BIFURCATED STATE IS  OHIO AND OHIO.
Jon:  I GUESS THAT'S, THE  LAST ONE IS THE BLUE STATE GAY  ONE.
THAT'S NOT FUNNY, JON.
Jon:  FROM THE 2016  ELECTION DESK. WE ALWAYS HEAR FROM -- SHE  INTERVIEWS UNDECIDED VOTERS. THIS YEAR WAS NO DIFFERENT.
THAT'S RIGHT, JON. I SAT DOWN WITH A GROUP OF  UNDECIDED VOTERS JUST HOURS  BEFORE THE POLLS OPENED. LAST NIGHT, THE NIGHT BEFORE THE  ELECTION WITH JUST EIGHT HOURS  UNTIL THE POLLS OPENED, I SAT DOWN WITH SOME OF THESE  UNDECIDED MORONS TO HELP THEM  MAKE UP THEIR MINDS. EVERY DEBATE I HAVE TO SIT THERE  AND WATCH PEOPLE LIKE YOU MIDDLE  WITH THEIR [BLEEP] DIALS ON YOUR [BLEEP] HAPPY METERS AT FOCUS  GROUPS ON CNET. I AM SICK OF IT, OBAMA OR  ROMNEY. I JUST WANT TO WEIGH UP THE  ISSUES. OBAMA OR ROMNEY. STILL THINKING. OBAMA OR ROMNEY. STILL NOT SURE. EVERY ELECTION THESE UNDECIDED  VOTERS WAIT UNTIL THE VERY  LAST -- WAIT A SECOND WERE THESE THE SAME. OH, MY, GOD. THE SAME PEOPLE FROM BEFORE? REALLY? AGAIN. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.
BECAUSE WE'RE THINKERS. WE'RE THINKERS.
OKAY. YOU ARE GOING TO DECIDE TONIGHT. NOBODY'S GETTING OUT OF HERE IF  THEY DON'T MAKE A DECISION. NOBODY.
CAN I GO TO THE BATHROOM  FIRST.
JAW MEAL, ARE YOU DID YOU DEAF. CLEARLY I WASN'T GETTING THROUGH  TO THEM. CLEARLY I'M NO EXPERT SO I SAT  DOWN WITH SHINA. >>Y BEEN STUDYING CHOICE AND THE  WAIVE WE MAKE CHOICES IN OUR  LIFE.
HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO YOU'RE  GOING TO BE ROOTING FOR IN THIS  ELECTION?
I DID FEEL THAT THIS IS NOT  AN EASY CHOICE.
OH NO, NO, NO, NO.
Jon:  THE CHOICE LADY. THE CHOICE LADY COULDN'T CHOOSE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon:  WHAT DID YOU DO.
YOU KNOW ME, JON I'M KIND OF  KNOWN AROUND THE OFFICE AS A  PROBLEM SOLVER FULL OF INGENUITY AND WHATNOT, SO I TOOK CARE OF  BUSINESS. GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY I  SHOULDN'T TAKE MY SHOE OFF MY  FOOT AND BEAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU TO DEATH WITH MY HIGH  HEEL.
ELECTION ISN'T YET SO I HAVE  A LITTLE TIME I THINK.
I'M GOING TO SOLVE THIS  PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE YOUR  GIRLFRIEND AGAIN UNTIL YOU  DECIDE RIGHT NOW ROMNEY OR  OBAMA.
THAT IS NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
OH, OKAY. WHO DOES THIS WOMAN BELONG TO?
EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GO MAKE  A PHONE CALL IMMEDIATELY.
GOOD LUCK, AMERICA. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT.
Jon:  VERY NICE. [CROWD CHEERING]
