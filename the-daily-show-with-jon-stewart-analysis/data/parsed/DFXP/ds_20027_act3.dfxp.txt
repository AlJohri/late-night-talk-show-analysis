Jon:  WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, GOT A NEW FILM OUT CALLED "INTERSTELLAR."
WILL YOU SPEND THE NIGHT? YOUR ROOM IS EXACTLY AS YOU LEFT IT. IT'S READY JUST TO --
I NEED TO GET BACK.
MY SEWING MACHINE IS IN THERE, BUT HERE'S PLENTY OF --
I NEED TO -- TOO MANY MEMORIES.
THE DUST.
THE DUST.
LOIS, I HAVE A FRIEND WHO COULD LOOK AT HIS LUNGS.
Jon:  COVER YOUR MOUTH, BOY! PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, JESSICA CHASTAIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]  HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Jon:  YOU'RE A BUSY PERSON.
OH MY GOSH. I'M SO BUSY.
Jon:  IT'S CRAZY BUSY.
YES. BUT I'M REALLY HAPPY.
Jon: IT'S GOOD, RIGHT. A GENTLEMAN IN THE AUDIENCE ASKED ME EARLIER, I THOUGHT THIS WAS INTERESTING, HE SAID, YOU'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD FOR YOURSELF. WHY DO YOU KEEP WORKING LIKE THIS? AND YOU KNOW HOW NORMALLY YOU'RE LIKE JUST DOING A WARM UP, YOUR LIKE HEY, I WAS BORN IN NOVEMBER, HOW YOU DOING AND ALL THAT [BLEEP] AND THEN SOMEBODY JUST CUTS YOU.
YEAH.
LIKE TO THE QUICK. AND YOU'RE LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHY I DO THAT.
SOMEONE SAID TO ME RECENTLY, THEY SAID YOU'RE WORKING SO MUCH, I'M WONDERING WHERE IS THE TENDERNESS IN YOUR LIFE? I WAS LIKE OH MY GOSH.
Jon:  WHERE IS THE TENDERNESS IN YOUR LIFE.
YES.
Jon: WAS THIS A KINDLY OLD GRANDMOTHER WHO SAID THIS?
IT WAS A KINDLY FRENCHMAN. HE HAD A FRENCH ACCENT. WHERE IS THE TENDERNESS IN YOUR LIFE?
Jon: SEE HERE'S WHAT I WONDER ABOUT THIS, SO HERE'S A GUY WHO PROBABLY DOESN'T WORK THAT MUCH SO HE'S PROBABLY TRYING TO MAKE IT SEEM WHAT HE DOES IS COOL AND WHAT YOU DO IS NOT COOL SO HE'S LIKE WHY DON'T YOU JUST SIT AND DRINK COFFEE ALL DAY.
YEAH. RIGHT. AND SPRAY PERFUME.
Jon: EXACTLY.
AND, YOU KNOW, WATCH THE SUNSET.
Jon: WHERE, NOW HAVE YOU SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME,  YOU'VE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME IN EUROPE, YES?
I LOVE EUROPE, YES.
IT'S PRETTY --
AND YOU JUST WENT TO ITALY, TO ROME.
Jon: I WENT TO ITALY LAST YEAR, I WENT TO ROME AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. I HAD NEVER BEEN. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN. I TRAVELED A LOT IN NEW JERSEY.
I'M SORRY, AFTER WATCHING THAT SEGMENT, I'M SO UPSET.
Jon: ISN'T THAT CRAZY?
I'M VEGAN TOO.
Jon:  ARE YOU REALLY VEGAN? [CROWD CHEERING] NOW TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT.
YEAH.
Jon: BECAUSE THAT'S A MOVE I DON'T KNOW I CAN, HERE'S MY PROBLEM.
OKAY.
Jon: I KNOW IT'S BAD. I KNOW THAT THE TREATMENT IS WRONG BUT MY GOD.
YOU LOVE THE BACON.
Jon: AND CHEESE BURGERS. IT'S VERY -- SO WHAT DO I DO?
OKAY, I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK. I DON'T THINK EATING MEAT IS WRONG. I UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE EAT MEAT AND THAT'S FINE FOR THEM.
Jon: RIGHT.
I THINK PUTTING ANIMALS IN CAGES WHERE THEY CAN'T TURN AROUND. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE AN ITCH? YOU CAN'T SCRATCH AN ITCH, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS TERRIBLE?
Jon:  DO YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT PIG.
WHAT?
Jon: WHERE IS THE TENDERNESS IN THAT PIG'S LIFE?
WHERE IS THE TENDERNESS?
Jon: WHERE IS THE TENDERNESS? BUT IT IS, YOU KNOW,  IT'S FUNNY, I WAS TALKING TO A GENTLEMAN EARLIER ABOUT THIS EXACT ISSUE AND HE SEEMS TO FEEL LIKE HE PREFERS HIS PIGS TO FACE IN ONE DIRECTION.
I SAW THAT. I THINK WE SHOULD PUT HIM IN ONE OF THOSE CRATES.
Jon: BUT IT IS, DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IT IS? PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT AWARE.
YEAH.
Jon: THERE MUST BE A WAY TO BALANCE THIS ISSUE WITH AGRICULTURE, WITH THE WAY THAT WE EAT IN A WAY THAT'S HEALTHIER NOT JUST FOR OURSELVES BUT THE ENTIRE -- THERE MUST BE.
THERE MUST. I MEAN, WE JUST HAVE TO HONOR, YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU'RE EATING FOOD SOMETIMES YOU DON'T THINK OF WHAT'S THE HISTORY WHERE THAT FOOD CAME FROM.
Jon:  RIGHT.
AND WHAT WERE THE SACRIFICES THAT WERE MADE TO, YOU KNOW, GIVE YOU SUSTENANCE.
Jon:  YEAH, THE SOMETHING.
AND REALLY LIKE YOU KNOW FOR AN ANIMAL TO GIVE ITS LIFE SO YOU CAN EAT THAT ONE THING AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING BUT YOU HAVE TO HONOR THAT ANIMAL'S LIFE.
Jon:  TRY AS MAKE IT --
NOT TORTURE IT.
Jon: NOT TORTURE IT.
IT'S LIKE WE'RE GOING OUT OF OUR WAY TO TORTURE THINGS, WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE IN.
Jon:  RIGHT. IT IS. YOU ALMOST FEEL LIKE THEY'RE DESIGNING SOMETHING LIKE  HOW DO YOU RAISE YOUR PIGS. WE KEEP, WE SIT ON THEM. WE JUST SIT ON THEM.
YEAH.
Jon: THEIR WHOLE LIVES. WE JUST SIT ON THEM. WHY, DOES THAT HELP? I JUST LIKE THE WAY IT FEELS TO SIT ON THEM, THAT'S ALL. PIGS ARE SMART TOO AND THEY'RE SMARTER THAN DOGS.
THEY'RE SMARTER THAN DOGS. AND I WAS TOLD A PIG IS AS SMART AS A TWO YEAR OLD AND CAN USE THE COMPUTER. A VERY SMALL COMPUTER, BUT YES?
Jon:  WHAT DO YOU THINK A PIG WOULD GOOGLE? WHAT? [LAUGHTER]
PROBABLY CHRISTIE'S HOME.  [CROWD CHEERING]
Jon: I THINK PIGS WOULD JUST TAP AWAY.
THERE'S HUNDREDS OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE.
Jon: THIS ONE FARM KEEPS ORDERING COPIES OF "ANIMAL FARM." I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. JUST CONSTANTLY WANTS TO WATCH ANIMAL FARM IT'S RIDICULOUS. NOW YOUR, THIS "INTERSTELLAR" IS A VERY, IT'S A BEAUTIFULLY COMPLEX AND VERY INTERESTING THING. YOU'RE ACTUALLY -- DO YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY THINGS.
OKAY.
Jon: YOU'RE IN IT.
I'M IN IT.
Jon: THAT MAY BE AS FAR AS I WANTED TO GO.
I PLAY AN ASTROPHYSICIST.
Jon: YOU PLAY AN ASTROPHYSICIST. YOU'RE NOT -- CAN I SAY THAT. YOU'RE NOT IN SPACE.
I'M NOT IN SPACE.
Jon:  SHE DOESN'T GO TO SPACE.
YES.
Jon: AND CAN I SAY ANYTHING ELSE? THAT'S IT.
YOU CAN SAY I  MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY'S DAUGHTER.
Jon: SHE PLAYS -- REALLY, I CAN SAY THAT?
YOU CAN SAY THAT.
Jon: BECAUSE THAT FEELS A LITTLE PLOTTY.
DON'T GET ME IN TROUBLE NOW THAT I'VE JUST SAID IT
Jon: OKAY, OKAY, SO SHE'S AN ASTROPHYSICIST. SHE DOES NOT GO TO SPACE. AND SHE'S MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY'S DAUGHTER. AND THAT'S THE WHOLE STORY.
IT'S SO GOOD THOUGH.
Jon: IT'S REALLY, YEAH.
IT'S LIKE THIS BEAUTIFUL SPACE AND ADVENTURE. AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN, AND THERE'S THIS WATER SEQUENCE THAT I COULDN'T BREATHE BECAUSE IT'S SO INTENSE. BUT THE MAIN PART OF IT IS ABOUT LOVE AND ABOUT A FATHER AND  DAUGHTER AND ABOUT THE BONDS OF LOVE.
Jon: RIGHT. BUT THAT'S WHAT, I LOVE A MOVIE, AND CHRISTOPHER NOLAN DOES THIS VERY WELL,  I LOVE A MOVIE THAT IS ABOUT SOMETHING.
YES.
Jon: AN EXPLORATION OF SOMETHING. SOMETHING THAT -- WELL, EXCEPT HE DIDN'T DO THAT IN "BATMAN."
WHAT?
Jon: "BATMAN" WAS REALLY ABOUT JUST A GUY WITH A REALLY DEEP VOICE. "INTERSTELLAR" IS -- YOU'RE GOING TO BE AN ASTRONAUT SOON, RIGHT.
YES, IN MY NEXT FILM I'LL BE PLAYING AN ASTRONAUT. FOR RIDLEY SCOTT FROM THE BOOK CALLED "THE MARTIAN." I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD OF THAT?
Jon: HAVE YOU DONE THE WHOLE TRAINING? DID THEY SPIN YOU AROUND IN THE THING?
I WAS AT JPL IN PASADENA LAST WEEK AND I GOT TO SEE --
Jon: YES, YES.
I MEAN THAT WAS THE UNMANNED STUFF. I GOT TO SEE CURIOSITY ROVER'S TWIN AND ALL THIS AMAZING THINGS FROM MARS. AND THIS WEEK I GET TO GO TO HOUSTON.
Jon: AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE THING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO LET ME DO. I'M GOING TO TRY AND DO EVERYTHING.
Jon:  THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE YOU THROW UP.
I'M ALL ABOUT IT.
ALL ASTRONAUT TRAINING IS --
SPINNING YOU.
Jon: THEY SPIN YOU AROUND AND THEY JUST GO ARE YOU GOING TO THROW UP?
YEAH. THAT'S FINE.
Jon: THAT'S THE WHOLE TRAINING.
I LOVE THAT EVERYONE'S FOCUSED ON SPACE EXPLORATION RIGHT NOW. I LOVE THAT ALL THESE SCIENCE FICTION --
Jon:  CAN YOU IMAGINE THEY LANDED A COMET.
ON A COMET.
Jon: ON A COMET. DO YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE CRAZIEST PART ABOUT IT. AND NOBODY KNOWS THIS, BRUCE WILLIS WAS ON THE PROBE. AND HE, NO BUT LISTEN, SO HE, AND HE -- [APPLAUSE] I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS. AND HE GAVE HIS LIFE.
NO, DON'T SAY THAT.
Jon:  NO, HE DID. STOP. LOOK. HE GAVE HIS LIFE TO IT AND JUST -- ♪ I DON'T WANT TO CLOSE MY EYES.  ♪ ♪ I DON'T WANT TO FALL ASLEEP  ♪ CAUSE I MISS YOU BABE AND I DON'T WANT TO MISS A THING ♪ [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] "INTERSTELLAR" IS -- ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY. INTERSTELLAR IT'S IN THE THEATRES RIGHT NOW, RIGHT?
RIGHT NOW.
Jon:  AND THAT IS NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY.
SEE IT ON IMAX.
Jon: WHY NOT? JESSICA CHASTAIN, EVERYBODY. [APPLAUSE]
