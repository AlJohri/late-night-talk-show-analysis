THE REBUTTAL. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  TO THE STAIN OF THE UNION?
NO, JON, TO YOUR JOKES ABOUT IT. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, WE'VE HEARD TONIGHT THE JOKES JON STEWART BELIEVES  AMERICA DESERVED TO HEAR, BUT WHAT OF THE JOKES WE DIDN'T HEAR? FOR INSTANCE, FRANK LUNTZ WAS ON FOX WEARING A SHIFT WITH A 23-INCH NECK ( LAUGHTER )  CNN BROADCAST FROM THE. JOKES AND OBSERVATIONS I THINK STRENGTHEN AMERICA AND JON STEWART JUST LET IT ALL SLIDE.
Jon:  JON, I THOUGHT THERE WERE OTHER SUBSTANTIVE THINGS.
BUT, BUT, BUT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S JON STEWART'S ROLE TO. I THINK AMERICA HAS A RIGHT TO LAUGH NOT JUST AT THE SPEECHES BUT THE INANE BLATHER  SURROUNDING THE SPEECHES, BLATHER SUCH AS.
HE'S NOT WEARING A RED TIE. IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S WEARING A PURPLE TIE ( LAUGHTER )

GOOD EVENING, AMERICA. I'M LARRY WILMOR. "THE DAILY SHOW" IS THE GREATEST SHOW THAT GOD HAS EVER GICHEN TO  THE PEOPLE OF EARTH AND YET IT IS IN TROUBLE.
Jon:  I ASSUME THIS IS ANOTHER REBUTTAL--
WE THE CORRESPONDENTS OF THE DAILY SHOW LOVE IT TOO MUCH TO SEE IT DESTROYED. I BELIEVE IN "DAILY SHOW" EXCEPTIONALISM BUT A SHOW THAT WAS ONCE YOUNG AND VIBRANT AND  THIN ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) A SHOW WHOSE BEST DAYS WERE STILL AHEAD OF IT IS NOW OLD AND  BLOATED, GRAYING, DROOPY FACED--
I-- ACTUALLY-- I CAN HEAR YOU  YOU. I'M ( LAUGHTER ).
FLATULENT, TUBERCULAT, IRON DEFENSE--
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
AND WHILE IT SITS HERE IN ITS OWN FETID DEATH STITCHING, THE  REST OF THE COMEDY WORLD CHARGES ON. THE TAIWANESE NOW TURN AROUND FAKE NEWS IN RECORD TIME TO GREAT RENOWN. THE IRANIANS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SATIRE OF MASS DESTRUCTION. I REMEMBER A "DAILY SHOW" WHERE A CORRESPONDENT COULD WORK HARD, GIVE IT EVERYTHING THEY HAD, AND ACHIEVE HIS DREAM OF LEAVING THIS SHOW FOR A BETTER CAREER IN  HOLLYWOOD ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WHERE IS OUR STEVEICA REEL, BOWL BARE, ED HELMS. TODAY'S IS THE FIRST GENERATION OF CORRESPONDENTS THAT WILL DO  WORSE THAN THE GENERATION BEFORE  BEFORE.
Jon:  I DON'T--
NO, NO, NO, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IS NOT THE "DAILY SHOW"  WE SHOULD LEAVE SP SAM AND JASON'S KIDS.
Jon:  THEY HAVE, LIKE, 10 KIDS-- BY, YOU GUYS ARE DOING GREAT. YOU'VE DONE BOOKS, OLIVER IS ON A SITCOM, OLIVIA MUN HAS THE  SHOW "THE PERFECT COUPLE."
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. THE ASIAN CORRESPONDENT HAS A SHOW? SEE, THEY'RE KICKING OUR BUTTS.
Jon:  SHE'S NOT CHINESE-- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FO
