NOVEMBER 7, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. I'M EXCITED. MR. CLINT EASTWOOD IS GOING TO BE HERE. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU. CLINT EASTWOOD WILL BE HERE. WE'LL SWAP STORIES ABOUT BEING ICONIC BAD ASSES OR AT LEAST ONE OF US. THEN I'LL JUST SIT THERE AND GO, YOU'RE SWELL. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AN AWFUL LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS VIEW MITT ROMNEY AS THE GREAT WHITE  NOTE AND HAVE THEREFORE STRUGGLED DESPERATELY FOR VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO MITT  ROMNEY EVEN GOING SO FAR TO PRETEND IT MIGHT BE MICHELE BACHMANN. RECENTLY HERMAN CAIN EMERGED AS THE LEADING ALTERNATIVE TO THE SCHNOOK OF MORMON. TODAY SHARON BIALEK ACCUSED CAIN OF OFFERING HER A JOB IN RETURN FOR ORAL SEX BACK IN  THE '90s. A SERIOUS CHARGE SOMEWHAT UNDERCUT BY HER UNFORTUNATELY CHOSEN LAWYER AND LOCATION, THE FRIAR'S CLUB.
SHE REACHED OUT TO MR. CAIN FOR HELP IN FINDING ANOTHER JOB. INSTEAD OF RECEIVING THE HELP SHE HAD HOPED FOR, MR. CAIN INSTEAD DECIDED TO PROVIDE HER  WITH HIS IDEA OF A STIMULUS PACKAGE.
Jon: NO, NO. THEN HE ASKED HER IF SHE WANTED TO OCCUPY BALL STREET. OH, DOCTOR. NOW THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR CAIN WHO IS ALREADY TRYING TO MOVE ON FROM THE SCANDAL OVER THE  WEEKEND AS YOU SEE IN THIS HILARIOUSLY EYE RONIC VIDEO.
MR. CAIN, ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO FILED A SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT....
DON'T EVEN GO THERE.
CAN I ASK MY QUESTION?
NO. THE FACT THAT THESE WOMEN DO WANT TO....
WHAT DID I SAY?
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT....
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. WHAT PART OF NO DON'T SOME PEOPLE UNDERSTAND?
Jon: I BELIEVE WHAT HERMAN CAIN IS SAYING IS NO MEANS NO. AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY. YOU'RE GOING TO GO, OH, LOOK AT THAT. YOU'RE GOING TO SAY LOOK AT HERMAN CAIN. LOOK AT HOW HERMAN CAIN IS DRESSED WITH THAT SUIT SURROUNDED BY ALL THOSE MICROPHONES. HE'S ASKING FOR IT. IT, OF COURSE, BEING HEIGHTENED MEDIA SCRUTINY. CAIN HAD HAD SOME SUCCESS IN CONTROLLING THE DAMAGE BY GOING ALL OUT AGAINST THE MEDIA.
THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA THAT ARE DOWNRIGHT DISHONEST. NOT ALL BUT TOO MANY OF THEM. IF THERE IS A JOURNALISTIC STANDARD, A LOT OF THEM DON'T FOLLOW IT. AND AS A RESULT TOO MANY PEOPLE GET MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION.
Jon: PEOPLE WHO GET DIRECTIONS TO A CIRCUMSTANCE SITUATION GET BRIS-INFORMATION. PEOPLE WHO GET JEAN SIMMONS TOUR DATES GET KISS-INFORMATION. THE ACID CONTENT OF YOUR BLADDER IS WELL, I THINK YOU GET THE IDEA. BUT, SEE, HERE'S THE PROBLEM. I OWE TIM MONEY IS WHAT I DO. THE PROBLEM FOR CAIN EXCEPT FOR THE OCCASIONAL TYPICAL MEDIA (BEEP)....
JUST WHO IS HERMAN CAIN'S WIFE AND WHY HASN'T SHE SAID ANYTHING YET?
Jon: BRING US THE WIFE OF THE ACCUSED. SO THAT WE MAY THROW TOMATOES AT HER AS WELL. THE PROBLEM FOR CAIN IS THAT FOR THE MOST PART THE BIG GET OF THE POLITICAL STORY WAS TRUE. THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION DID PAY A BUNCH OF MONEY TO TWO LADIES TO SETTLE  HARASSMENT CLAIMS AGAINST HERMAN CAIN. WHICH BY THE WAY EVEN HERMAN CAIN SEEMED TO KNOW ABOUT IN 2003.
IN 2003 HERMAN CAIN RAN FOR THE SENATE. HE HIRED A GENERAL CONSULTANT, KURT ANDERSON. MR. CAIN DIVULGED THE N.R.A.CLAIMS AT THAT TIME TO HIS GENERAL CONSULTANT.
THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION.
EXACTLY. MR. ANDERSON. SO THE CAMPAIGN AT THAT POINT WOULD BE PREPARED IF THE ISSUE SURFACED.
Jon: BY 2011, HIS MEMORY HADï¿½r BECOME... ALL FADED.
I AM UNAWARE OF ANY SORT OF SETTLEMENT. I HOPE IT WASN'T FOR MUCH BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
Jon: OH, YOU DIDN'T? THAT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE THEY PAID HER $482 MILLION. AND THE SECOND PROBLEM WITH HERMAN CAIN'S BLAME THE MEDIA STORY LINE IS THAT THE FIRST  PLACE CABLE NEWS NETWORK IS DOING THE BEST TO HELP HIM.
DO YOU THINK OTHERS IN THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN GIVING TOO MUCH CREDENCE TO THESE RIGHT  NOW ANONYMOUS ALLEGATIONS? POLITICO CHOSE NOT TO NAME THE WOMEN INVOLVED IN THESE TWO CASES WHICH I FOUND INTERESTING.
Jon: VERY INTERESTING. ANYONE WHO USED ANONYMOUS SOURCES SHOULD BE DRUMMED OUT OF JUMBLISM UNLESS....
AN UNNAMED SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL TELLS POLITICO THE UNION FLUSHED TEN MILLION  OF THEIR MEMBERS' MONEY DOWN THE TOILET ON A POINTLESS EXERCISE. THAT'S A QUOTE. MANY BELIEVE IT'S FROM RAHM EMANUEL. ALL POLITICO SAYS IS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL. IS THE LOVE AFFAIR BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND ORGANIZED LABOR OVER?
Jon: YOU'RE JUST GOING TO RUN WITH IT. ALL RIGHT. TO BE FAIR THAT'S NOT ANONYMOUS, OF COURSE. MANY BELIEVE IT'S RAHM EMANUEL. THAT WAS KIND OF EASY. A LOT OF POLITICAL STORIES USE ANONYMOUS SOURCING. THE REAL TRICK FOR OUR CRACK RESEARCH TEAM WOULD BE TO USE ANONYMOUS SOURCES TO DISCREDIT  A REPORT YOU HAVE DISMISSED BECAUSE IT HAS USED ANONYMOUS SOURCES. BUT TO FIND A CLIP LIKE THAT, IT WOULD BE LIKE THE HOLY GRAIL. A PIPE DREAM. ROLL THAT CLIP.
THE STORY CAME FROM ANONYMOUS SOURCES. SO IF THAT THEORY IS TRUE WE SHOULD GO BACK AND SAY WELL THEN HOW DID THIS STORY EVER  SURFACE BECAUSE DID IT COME FROM SOURCES WHO WILL GO ON THE RECORD? NO. I DON'T THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE HAPPY WITH FINDING OUT WHO PLANTED THE  STORY AND HAPPY WITH THE PERSON WHO DID IT.
THE WORD IS FROM THE WASHINGTON TIMES THAT ACCORDING TO A SOURCE WHOSE  FRIENDS WITH THE CAIN CAMP NOT ONLY IS RICK PERRY CAMPAIGN INVOLVED BUT THE MAYOR OF  CHICAGO, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF RAHM EMANUEL IS LIKELY INVOLVED WITH THE SEXUAL  HARASSMENT ACCUSER ATTACKS.
Jon: ANONYMOUS SOURCES ARE HORRIBLE. I KNOW. THIS ANONYMOUS SOURCE SAYS THE CODE OF JOURNALISM IS SIMPLY THIS. IT'S NOT OKAY TO USE AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE. UNLESS IT'S ABOUT RAHM EMANUEL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
