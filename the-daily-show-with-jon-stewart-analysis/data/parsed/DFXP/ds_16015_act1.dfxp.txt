JANUARY 26, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW" LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! I'M JON STEWART. POLITICAL AUTHOR JONATHAN ALTER WILL BE JOINING US. WE BEGIN WITH THE BIG POLITICAL STORY OF... YESTERDAY ( LAUGHTER ) LAST NIGHT, BARACK OBAMA DELIVERED HIS SECOND STATE OF  THE UNION ADDRESS, ALONG WITH WHAT APPEARS TO LOOK LIKE A BUDDY COMEDY SCREEN PLAY HE  BELIEVES JOE BIDEN AND JOHN BOEHNER WOULD BE PERFECT FOR. IT'S CALLED WATER WORKS AND MOTORMOUTH. JOHN BOEHNER IS RALPH WATERWORKS AND JOE BIDEN WON'T SHUT UP. ANYHOW-- LAST NIGHT WAS A BIT UNUSUAL. N THAT TO HONOR RECUPERATING COLLEAGUE GABBY GIFFORDSS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS SAT  TOGETHER RISKING PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH THEM POLITICALLY. JOHN McCAIN AND JOHN KERRY NATURALLY PAIRED OFF. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND AND JOHN THUNE SAT TOGETHER TO REMIND EVERYONE IF THE SENATE WAS EVER  CALLED UPON TO REPOPULATE THE EARTH, THESE TWO WOULD PROBABLY BE OUR BEST SHOT. LAYOFF LAUGH ( APPLAUSE ). OF COURSE, THE FIRST THING ANY PRESIDENT HAS TO DO IS COME OUT AND TELL EVERYONE THE STATE OF  THE UNION IS STRONG.
AMERICA'S FALLEN TO NINTH IN THE PROPORTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE. THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE THAN IT TAKES IN. COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND RUSSIA INVEST MORES IN THE ROADS AND RALE WAYS THAN WE DO. CHINA IS BUILDING FASTER TRAINS. WHEN OUR OWN ENGINEERS GRADED OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE, THEY GAVE US A "D." ( LAUGHTER ) GLON MY GOD, I THINK THIS MIGHT BE AN INTERVENTION! OR THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO GROUND US. HEY, MAN! WE'RE TRYING REALLY HARD!
SOUTH KOREAN HOMES NOW HAVE GREATER INTERNET ACCESS THAN WE DO. LAST MONTH WE FINALIZED A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH SOUTH KOREA. IN SOUTH KOREA, TEACHERS ARE DESCRIBED AS NATION BUILDERS.
Jon:  WE'RE NOT SOUTH KOREANS AND WE NEVER WILL BE! HE HAS A POINT. SOUTH KOREA IS DOING WELL THESE DAYS. IT'S AS THOUGH THEY HAVE THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS TAKING CARE OF THEIR MILITARY NEEDS SO  THEY CAN FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY. LIKE ALL GOOD COACHES, AFTER TEARING US DOWN, COACH OBAMA BUILTs BACK UP.
THIS IS A COUNTRY WHERE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE. NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM. AS CONTENTIOUS AND FRUSTRATING AND MESSY AS OUR DEMOCRACY CAN SOMETIMES BE, I KNOW THERE ISN'T  A PERSON HERE WHO WOULD TRADE PLACES WITH ANY OTHER NATION ON EARTH ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  EXCEPT MAYBE SOUTH KOREA WITH THEIR... WIFI INTERNET ACCESS ( LAUGHTER ) TRADE AGREEMENTS! WHY ARE YOU BEING SO NICE TO US ALL OF A SUDDEN.
HALF A CENTURY AGO WHEN THE SOVIET UNIONS BEAT US INTO SPACE  WITH THE LAUNCH OF SPUTNIK, WE HAD NO IDEA HOW WE WOULD BEAT THEM TO THE MOON. WE UNLEASHED A WAVE OF INNOVATIONS THAT CREATED NEW INDUSTRIES AND MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS. THIS IS OUR GENERATION'S SPUTNIK MOMENT.
Jon:  ( BLEEP )! GO HOME! I'M WITH YOU. WHERE ARE WE GOING? THE MOON? MARS? PLUTO? PANDORA FOR THEIR RESERVES OF DLIRS UNORBTANIUM?
WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, WE'LL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR BUSINESSES TO DEPLOY THE NEXT GENERATION OF HIGH-SPEED  WIRELESS COVERAGE TO 98% OF ALL AMERICANS. WITHIN 25 YEARS OUR GOAL IS TO GIVE 80% OF AMERICANS ACCESS TO HIGH-SPEED RAIL AND BECOME THE  FIRST COUNTRY TO HAVE A MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD BY 2015.
Jon:  THAT'S OUR SPUTNIK MOMENT. THEIRS WAS WE HAVE 10 YEARS TO REACH THE MOON AND OURS WAS WE HAVE 25 YEARS TO MAKE SURE 80%  OF US LIVE NEAR SOMEWHAT FASTER TRAIN? IT'S LIKE TELLING VINCE LOMBARDI TELLING THE PACKERS I WANT YOU TO LEAVE EVERYTHING ON THE FIELD. NOW GET OUT THERE AND COVER THE SPREAD! OF COURSE, THE EVENING WASN'T ALL TRAINS AND WIFIS PURPOSE THERE WERE HUMAN STORIES, REAL  AMERICANS WHO, BY INCREDIBLE LUCK, HAPPENED TO BE IN THE AUDIENCE THIS VERY NICE.
ONE MOTHER OF TWO, A WOMAN NAMED KATHY PROCTOR HWORKED IN THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY SINCE SHE  WAS 18 YEARS OLD. AND SHE TOLD ME SHE'S EARNING HER DEGREE IN BIOTECHNOLOGY NOW. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  IT WAS ACTUALLY AN INCREDIBLY GENUINE HUMAN MOMENT AND VERY LOVELY, ALTHOUGH  SOMEWHAT UNDERCUT BY HER BEHAVIOR LATER IN THE SPEECH.
THAT DREAM IS A STORY OF A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER NAMED BRAND  BRANDON FISHER. THAT DREAM IS WHY A WORKING CLASS KID FROM SCRANTON CAN SIT BEHIND ME, HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD. 33 MEN WERE TRAPPED IN THE CHILEAN MINE.
Jon:  YOU HAD YOUR MOMENT! LET THE MINERS HAVE THEIR MOMENT! OF COURSE, MISPROCTOR WASN'T THE ONLY ONE IN THE AUDIENCE EXCITED  BY THEIR PRESIDENTIAL SHOUT-OUT.
OF COURSE AS WE SPEAK, AL QAEDA AND HIRE AFFILIATES CONTINUE TO PLAN ATTACKS AGAINST US. WE'VE ALSO TAKEN THE FIGHT TO AL QAEDA, AND THEIR ALLIES ABROAD. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  I DON'T-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE DIDN'T JUST GRAB HIM. NOW, OF COURSE FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS THE OPPOSITION  PARTY'S REBUTTAL, OR IT IS SOMETIMES KNOWN THE "BLOW YOUR  POLITICAL CAPITAL NIGHT" OR "THE MARCH OF THE FUTURE COMMERCE SECRETARY."  WHO DREW THE REPUBLICAN SHORT STRAW LAST NIGHT?
GOOD EVENING, I'M CONGRESSMAN PAUL RYAN FROM WISE CONSON.
Jon:  IT'S PAUL RYAN FROM AN ABANDONED "LAW AND ORDER" SET  SET. BOLD CHOICE. THE CONGRESSMAN WHO WROTE THE RODE MAP FOR AMERICAN FUTURE, REPLACING MEDICARE WITH A PERSONAL HEALTH CARE ACCOUNT VOUCHER. SP IT DOESN'T EVEN MENTION DEFENSE SPENDING AS CONTRIBUTING ANY WAY TO THE DEFICIT. IT'S PRETTY HARD CORE. LET'S HEAR HIM SELL THAT VISION OF LIMITED GOVERNMENT TO A PRIME-TIME AUDIENCE.
WE BELIEVE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IS BOTH VITAL AND LIMITED TO THE  DEFEND THE NATION FROM ATTACK AND PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE, TO SECURE OUR BORDERS, TO PROTECT INNOCENT LIFE, TO UPHOLD OUR LAWS AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, TO ENSURE  DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY, TO HELP PROVIDE A SAFETY NET FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES  ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  SO YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU JUST MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE-- HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT THAN-- I  GUESS YOU ARE A DIFFERENT KIND OF REPUBLICAN, THE KIND THAT'S  TRYING TO SOUND LIKE YOU'RE NOT A REPUBLICAN-- RYAN GOING OFF THE RESERVATION, WHO-- WHO WOULD  SPEAK FOR THE REAL AMERICA? AAHH! IT'S MICHELLE BACHMAN WITH THE OFFICIAL TEA PARTY REBUTTAL. ALTHOUGH, SOMETHING SEEMED A LITTLE BIT OFF.
GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELLE BACHMAN FROM INNESOTA'S SIXTH DISTRICT.M  I WANT TO THANK THE TEA PARTY EXPRESS AND TEA PARTY H.D. FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK THIS EVENING  ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  WHO ARE YOU LOOKING AT, CONGRESSWOMAN?
WE'RE IN THE VERY EARLY DAYS OF A HISTORY-MAKING TURN IN AMERICA. PLEASE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT YOUR CALLS, VISITS, AND LETTERS ARE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF OUR LIBERTIES. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon, YOU KNOW, SHE HAS SUCH POISE, SUCH ELQAIGZ, BUT YOU KNOW SHE CAN'T BE LOOKING AT  A TELEPROMPTER BECAUSE SHE'S SO ANTI-PROMPTER. WHAT IS SHE LOOKING AT? IS SHE BEING COACHED?
LET ME SHOW YOU A CHART. HERE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS. IN OCTOBER 2001, OUR NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS AT 5. 3%. IN 2008, IT WAS AT 6.6%.
Jon:  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
