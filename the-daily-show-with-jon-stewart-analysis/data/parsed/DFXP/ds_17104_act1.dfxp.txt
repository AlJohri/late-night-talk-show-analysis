Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. BOOM, WE'RE BACK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". I WANT TO SAY RIGHT OFF THE TOP U.S.S. ROOSEVELT BRINGING THE NICE PICTURES AND THE GUYS  BRINGING THE NICE THINGS AND SOME GUY FROM ENGLAND WHO -- I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] [  APPLAUSE  ] HAS A DISEASED MIND. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE SO HAPPY TO BE BACK. I'M JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS THE AUTHOR OF A GREAT NEW BOOK ON HOME GARDENING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- ANYWAY, WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE THE FIRST LADY TONIGHT. FIRST, REAL QUICK OFF THE TOP. WE'VE BEEN OUT OF OFFICE TWO WEEKS. WHEN I'M ON VACATION THE ONLY NEWS I KEEP UP IS THE LATEST. OBVIOUSLY I READ THE HUFFINGTON POST MY ONE STOP SOURCE. THE LATEST SCOOP INVOLVES MILEY CYRUS AND HER SIDE BOOB. NEXT 20 THAT I CROSSING THIS STORY ABOUT HOW ROGER AILES SAID I ADMITTED TO HIM IN A BAR THAT  I'M A SOCIALIST. NOW, I DIDN'T DOUBT THE STORY. [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW WATCHING FOX NEWS MAKES YOU MISINFORMED. BUT RUNNING IT DOESN'T. BUT I COULDN'T REMEMBER SO -- AND THIS IS TRUE, I CALLED HIM NOT ON THE PHONE. I SAT IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR AND SAID HIS NAME THREE TIMES. SO, SORRY. NO. HE CALLED ME BACK. VERY GRACIOUS HE CALLED ME BACK. ROGER AILES CALLED ME BACK AND REMINDED ME THAT 12 YEARS AGO WE MET IN PHILADELPHIA AT THE  REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN A BAR AND THEN IT ALL CAME FLOODED BACK. GREAT PARTY, ROGER AILES, THE HEAD OF FOX NEWS. GREAT PARTY.
THANKS.
Jon: EVER TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE SOCIALISM? JUST LOVE IT. THE WHOLE REDISTRIBUTION.
LISTEN ANDY DICK JUST TOOK A (bleep) ON YOUR SUNDAE BAR. HAVE A GOT NIGHT, OKAY.
I SHOULD GO TAKE CARE OF THAT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT SEE YOU, ROGER AILES, HEAD OF FOX NEWS. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, YEAH, YOU KNOW, THE REAL QUESTION THERE, ONE, WHY DID I GO TO AN EYES WIDE SHUT ORGY  DRESSED AS YEEHAW ALBERT BROOKS? [ LAUGHTER ] IT CONCERNED TO ME I'M AN OLD AND UNATTRACTIVE MAN NOW. REALLY. AND TWO, WHY DIDN'T ROGER AILES MENTION WHEN HE ADMITTED TO ME BEFORE WHICH WAS -- AND  OBVIOUSLY IT'S BEEN A LOT OF YEARS AND I'M PARAPHRASING BUT I  THINK WHAT HE SAID TO ME ONCE WAS JON, DID I EVER TELL YOU THAT I, ROGER AILES, PLAN TO  UNDERMINE THE ROLE OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESIDENT. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME --  [ LAUGHTER ] FILLING THE EDITORIAL VACUUM THAT THAT CREATES BY FILLING THE PROPAGANDA JUGGERNAUT FROM THE  GUYS AT A NEWS ORGANIZATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE SAID TO ME, HE GOES, JON, I'M GOING TO CALL THE ORGANIZATION  FOX NEWS AND IT'S TAG LINE WILL BE -- YOU'RE GOING TOLL LOVE THIS -- A FANATICALLY MICRO  MANAGED FIVE DOM WHERE MY OWN PERSONAL AGENDA DRIVE EVERY ASPECT OF THE OPERATION AND BALANCE. I'M PARAPHRASING. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY SO THAT GOES DOWN. AND THEN CAME THIS CLIP UNEARTHED BY A CONSERVATIVE WEB SITE.
I THINK YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT, JON.
Jon: I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY CORRECT. I WOULD SAY I'M MORE OF A SOCIALISM OR INDEPENDENT. OH, MY GOD! I LOOK GREAT. WOW! DHAWZ. WOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST REALIZED THAT INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED JUST MOMENTS -- MOMENTS BEFORE  LARRY KING DRAINED ME OF MY YOUTH. [ LAUGHTER ] LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHEN I THINK I MEANT BY THE COMMENT ON THAT SHOW SEEING I HAVE AT  VARIOUS TIMES DESCRIBED MYSELF AS SOCIALIST, INDEPENDENT, WIG, ROCKEFELLER INDEPENDENT P TEDDY ROOSEVELT DEMOCRAT AND (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T BELIEVE IN STATE CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL OR COLLECTIZING -- COLLECTIVIZING FARMS BUT I  BELIEVE THERE'S VALUE IN POLICIES THAT DERIVE FROM A MORE SOCIALIST ETHOS.
I THINK SOCIAL SECURITY IS AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM.
Jon: LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY. THANK YOU COURAGEOUS COMRADE. I BELIEVE IN THAT A SOCIALIZED PROGRAM TO EASE POFERLY AMONG THE ELDERLY THAT WE ALL CONTRIBUTE TO. WHAT ELSE WOULD BE SOCIALIST?
MEDICARE WILL SAVE THE SAFETY NET OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THAT  OUR ESTEEMED ELDERS IN COUNTRY NEED.
Jon: SEE YOU AT THE MEETING, SISTER SARA. I USED THE TERM SOCIALISM IN THE YEAR 2000 BEFORE OBAMA RUINED IT FOR EVERYBODY.
BARACK OBAMA IS A SOCIALIST. IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
HE'S OBVIOUSLY A SOCIALIST.
HIS SOCIALIST POLICIES ARE BANKRUPTING AMERICA.
HIS SOCIALIST POLICIES ARE RUINING AMERICA.
Jon: YES, SOCIALISM IS A NEW S WORD. THE WORSE THING YOU CAN CALL SOMEONE. IT'S LIKE IF THE C WORD AND THE N WORD HAD A BABY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT BABY'S NAME:  OBAMA.
OBAMA CARE IS QUITE CLEARLY THE CROWN JEWEL OF SOCIALISM.
OBAMA CARE IS THE FLAGSHIP OF SOCIALISM. IT'S PURE UNADULT RATED SOCIALISM.
Jon: UNCUT, GOT STUFF. [ LAUGHTER ] APPARENTLY SOCIALISM IS LIKE CHOLESTEROL SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE ARE THE GOOD KIND. OBAMA CARE IS THE BAD KIND, UNADULT RATED SOCIALISM, A PROGRAM WHERE EVERYONE WILL BE FORGED TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE  IN A COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE OF PRIVATE PROFIT INSURANCE COMPANIES, THE MARXIST DREAM. GET THE FOATON BY MY DESK. YES, THAT'S BETTER. [ LAUGHTER ] SOME WOULD SAY -- SOME WOULD SAY ISN'T OUR CURRENT SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE MORE LIKE SOCIALIZED  MEDICINE BECAUSE WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THE MILLIONS OF CITIZENS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE? WELL, SHUT UP! [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE OBAMA'S REAL SOCIALIST SCHEME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HEALTH CARE.
HE'S BASICALLY SOCIALIZED THE AUTO INDUSTRY. HE IS MOVING TO FREE MARKET CAPITALISM TO SOCIALISM. HE SOCIALIZED AUTO CAPS.
I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR NEW LINE OF SOCIALIST CARS AMERICA, THE AMC KREMLIN, THE CLIFTLESS LE BARO, THE CHE-ROLET. NOW THAT THE TAX PAIR BAILOUT THAT ALLOWED -- ANY SOCIALISTS OUT THERE COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO  TAKE THE CREDIT?
THAT WAS THE RIGHT COURSE. I ARGUED FOR IT FROM THE BEGINNING. FINALLY WHEN THAT WAS DONE AND HELP WAS GIVEN COMPANIES GOT BACK ON THEIR FEET. I'LL TAKE CREDIT FOR THE FACT THAT THIS INDUSTRY HAS COME BACK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HERE IS HOW YOU KNOW -- HERE IS HOW YOU KNOW WHEN A SOCIALIST POLICY HAS WORKED? WHEN A STAUNCH CAPITALIST TAKES CREDIT FOR IT WITH A HOSTILE TAKEOVER. NOT EVERY OBAMA SOCIALIST IS WORTHY OF THE ROMNEY NAME.
IT'S PART OF TRYING TO REMAKE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN A SOCIALIST MODEL. YOU HAVE THE GOVERNMENT GOING IN PICKING WINNERS AND LOSER AND IN THE CASE OF SOLYNDRA PICKED A  CLEAR LOSER.
YOU ARE SOCIALIZING THIS COUNTRY.
Joe: YOU DON'T PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE GOVERNMENT. YOU LET THE MARKET DECIDE AND THIS SOLAR PANEL COMPANY, NO -- ANY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY OF  PRIVATE ENTERPRISE IS WRONG.
THAT'S A SUBSIDY, ALLOW THAT INDUSTRY TO GET UP AND RUNNING  AND IT'S SOMETHING WHICH I SUPPORT.
Jon: WHAT THE (bleep). SO WAIT -- IN TERMS OF SUBSIDIES, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, IN TERMS OF SUBSIDIES, SUN TO SOLAR PANELS TO ENERGY SOCIALISM, SUN TO CORN TO ENERGY -- AMERICA! CAN'T WE JUST ADMIT A SOCIALIST IS SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO SPEND GOVERNMENT MONEY OR (bleep)  YOU DON'T LIKE. THEN WE CAN DISPENSE WITH THE NAME CALLING AND FIND AN INDUSTRY WE AGREE IS GREAT.
HOUSE RESOLUTION 670 OFFERED BY THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA WOULD  CONGRATULATIONS PITS BUFERG STEELERS ON WINNING THE 2006NFL TITLE.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. PROFOOTBALL, AMERICA WHAT IS MORE AMERICAN THAN THE NFL. IT'S A BUSINESS BUILT TO RUN THE RIGHT WAY.
THE REAL KEY IS THE UNORTHODOX BUSINESS MODEL. UNDER LEAGUE RULES THE TEAMS ARE REQUIRED TO SHARE REVENUE WITH EACH OTHER WHICH IS ALWAYS A  STICKING POINT WITH SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FRANCHISES AND THE MORE POLITCALLY CONSERVATIVE OWNERS.
THAT'S SOCIALIST, ISN'T IT?
IT'S A FORM OF SOCIALISM AND IT'S WORKED QUITE WELL FOR US.
Jon: BURN HIM! BURN HIM! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
