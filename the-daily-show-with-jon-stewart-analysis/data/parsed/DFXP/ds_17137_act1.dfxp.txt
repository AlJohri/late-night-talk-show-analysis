Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS IT IS "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT, INCLUDING A VISIT FROM AN EXCITING NEW, FRESH, YOUNG, COMEDIAN, CHRISTOPHER ROCK. ( LAUGHTER ). I EXPECT BIG THINGS FROM HIM. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH AMERICA, FOLKS. THESE ARE TROUBLED TIMES. IN THIS MAJESTIC LAND. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THERE IS ONE PROBLEM IN OUR GREAT COUNTRY WHICH STANDS OUT, PERHAPS ABOVE ALL OTHERS-- VOTER FRAUD. HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM? DO WE KNOW HOW BIG A PROBLEM IT IS?
Jon:  I'M GOING TO SAY IT'S BIGGER THAN RINGWORM. ( LAUGHTER ). AND LESS THAN BIEBER FEVER. ( LAUGHTER ) ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WE HAD A VOTER FRAUD PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE HAVE A VOTER FRAUD PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  I STAND CREBTED. IS IT PROVEN?
IT'S A PROVEN PROBLEM, A SERIOUS THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  WELL, I HOPE WE HAVE OUR BEST PEOPLE ON IT.
NOW TO THE FOX NEWS VOTER FRAUD UNIT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS )
Jon:  YES, CONSERVATIVES AND THEIR MEDIA DIVISION ARE UP IN ARMS OVER VOTER FRAUD, AND  THIS YEAR ALMOST ENTIRELY IN SWING STATES WITH REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED LEGISLATURES, THEY ARE DOING  SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
A LOT OF THESE STATES, SWING STATES IN PARTICULAR, HAVE PASSED VOTER I.D. AND VOTER  SUPPRESSION LAWS.
NEW VOTER I.D. LAWS IN TEXAS, TENNESSEE, KANSAS, WISCONSIN.
Jon:  PENSYLLA-TUCKY, ARC ANBAMMA, FLORALINEA. AND NEW OHIO. OR NEW HIGHO. STATES ARE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COMBAT VOTER FRAUD THROUGH STRATEGIES LIKE PURGING  VOTER ROLES AND REQUIRING PHOTO I.D.s, EVEN THOUGH A STUDY BY A GROUP THAT SUPPORTS THE LAWS, THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN LAWYERS ASSOCIATION-- WHICH, BY THE WAY, IF YOU EVER JUST WANT TO SMOKE SOME CIGARS AND PLAY SOME GOLF WITH SOME RULE DOUCHEBAGS--  ( LAUGHTER ) ...THERE YOU GO. ANYWAY, THEY SAID THIS --
THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN LAWYERS ONLY FOUND 340 CASES OF VOTER FRAUD OVER A 10-YEAR  PERIOD IN ALL OF AMERICA.
Jon:  OH, MY GOD! ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S ALMOST... .7 CASES PER STATE PER YEAR. ( LAUGHTER ). AND IT ALSO INCLUDES REGISTRATION FRAUD LIKE A MICKEY MOUSE PETITION. BUT STILL, EVEN PENNSYLVANIA, WHICH IS NOW DEFENDING ITS PHOTO I.D. LAW IN COURT SAID THIS --
THE STATE ADMITS IT IS "NOT AWARE OF ANY INCIDENTS OF IN-PERSON VOTER FRAUD IN PENNSYLVANIA. IN ADDITION, THE STATE SAYS IT HAS NO EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT IN-PERSON VOTER FRAUD IS LIKELY  TO OCCUR IN DECEMBER 2012 IN THE ABSENCE OF THE PHOTO I.D. LAWS.
Jon:  I REST MY CASE, YOUR HONOR. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. THIS WON'T STOP IT. I THINK YOU CAN SEE WHY WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) NEXT UP, LEIBER LAWS FOR UNICORNS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S VERY ODD, REPUBLICANS-- REPUBLICANS ARE THROWING MONEY  AT THIS PROBLEM THAT SEEMS TO HAVE VERY LITTLE FACTUAL EVIDENCE BEHIND IT, BECAUSE I  CAN THINK OF ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS PERHAPS A LARGER BODY OF SCIENTIFIC WORK BEHIND IT THAT  THEY ARE SOMEWHAT RELUCTANT TO TACKLE.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING CLIMATE CHANGE ON THIS PLANET, AND THE IDEA OF SPENDING TRLZ AND TRLZ OF DOLLARS TO TRY TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS IS NOT  RIGHT COURSE DISPL WE NEED A GLOBAL WARMING INVESTIGATION UNIT. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME SOMEBODY CHECKED ON GEORGE? I SEEM TO RECALL AT THIS CONFERENCE I ATTENDED RECENTLY AT THE CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK FOUNDATION:
EVERY TIME YOU SEE A TRULY MASSIVE, COORDINATED EFFORT AT VOTER FRAUD, IT USUALLY INVOLVES  IN PART, ABSENTEE VOTING.
Jon:  THAT'S WEIRD. WHY ARE THEY EMPHASIZING THE VOTER I.D. PART, THEN, AND NOT THE ABSENTEE BALLOT PART.
IT IS A FAIR AWMENT OF THIS LIBERALS THERE ARE SHOULD PEOPLE  WHO IGNORE THE ABSENTEE BALLOT PART BECAUSE SUPPOSEDLY REPUBLICANS LIKE ABSENTEE  BALLOTS MORE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO RESTRICT THAT.
Jon:  I GUESS IT WOULD BE A FAIR ARGUMENT OR AS IT IS SOMETIMES ALSO CALLED--  JUSTIFICATION FOR A LAWSUIT. IF RESTRICTING ABSENTEE BALLOTS SEEMINGLY HELPS REPUBLICANS, WHO DOES REQUIRING PHOTO I.D.s TARGET?
IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT MORE HEAVILY THE GROUPS LIKE MINORITY, THE POOR, ELDERLY, STUDENT.
Jon:  YES! FINALLY THE FREE RIDE FOR THIS COUNTRY'S MINORITY POOR, ELDERLY, AND STUDENT IS OVER. ( LAUGHTER ) NO MORE LIVING ON EASY STREET FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY LIVING ON SKID ROW. THE ONLY THING MORE BLATANT WOULD BE IF YOU HAD SOME REPUBLICAN STATE REP IN  PENNSYLVANIA TOUTING HOW VOTER I.D. LAWS WOULD BE HANDING THE ELECTION TO REPUBLICANS.
VOTER I.D., WHICH IS GOING TO ALLOW GOVERNOR ROMNEY TO WIN THE  STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, DONE.
Jon:  NO ONE IS VIDEOTAPING THIS, RIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE I'M GOING TO LOOK LIKE AN ASS ( BLEEP ). WE GO TO JESSICA WILLIAMS IN PENNSYLVANIA. JESSICA, NICE TO SEE YOU ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR THESE NEW REGULATIONS FOCUS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON MINORITIES AND THE POOR.
YES, JON, THAT'S RIGHT. DEFINITELY.
Jon:  WHAT IF THROUGH A CONCERTED EFFORT THOSE GROUPS ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN THESE PHOTO  I.D.s NECESSARY?
NOT TO WORRY, JON. THERE ARE SOME NEW REGULATIONS INTRODUCED THAT WILL FEATHER BATTLE THIS RAMPANT VOTER FRAUD. IN YOU WOULD LIKE TO VOTE YOU WILL BE MATCHED AGAINST THIS, OKAY? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  YUP.
YOU'LL HAVE TO FALL IN THE NONVOTER FRAUD COLOR RANGE, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN VENETIAN DREAM AND TOASTED MERINGUE OVER HERE.
Jon:  OKAY. HOW ARE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO KEEP UP WITHAL THESE DIFFERENT REGULATIONS THEN?
IT'S ALL IN THE NEW SWING STATES' HANDY VOTER'S GUIDE, "YOU MIGHT BE AN ELIGIBLE VOTER IF..."
Jon:  LIKE THE OLD JEFF FOXWORTHY YOU MIGHT BE A REDNECK GAG.
ONE OF THE RULES IS YOU HAVE TO GET THAT REFERENCE TO BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. SO YOU'RE OFF TO A GOOD START, JON. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE-- IF YOU HAVE A FAVORITE MEG RYAN MOVIE, YOU MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. AND HERE'S ANOTHER ONE:  IF YOU'VE EVER SPOKEN TO A POLICE OFFICER VOLUNTARILY, YOU MIGHT  BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE!
Jon:  I GET IT. LET ME TAKE A CRACK AT THIS. IF YOU OWN MORE THAN THREE POLO SHIRTS, YOU MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE.
WHAT? ARE YOU SAYING BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD POLO T-SHIRTS, JON? THAT'S REALLY RACIST.
Jon:  NO I WAS JUST EYE THOUGHT-- I WAS JUST GO ALONG WITH THE GAMES, AND SAYING THE RULES.
NO, I'M JUST ( BLEEP ) WITH YOU, JON. I'M ( BLEEP ) WITH YOU. OWNING THREE OR MORE POLO SHIRTS IS RULE NUMBER NINE. YOU CAN ALWAYS FOLLOW THE NEW GENERAL GUIDELINES AGAINST VOTER FRAUD IN THESE SWING STATES. IF YOU'RE BLACK OR POOR OR ELDERLY AND NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR MITT ROMNEY, STAY THE  ( BLEEP ) AT HOME. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  I GOT IT. THANK YOU, JESS
