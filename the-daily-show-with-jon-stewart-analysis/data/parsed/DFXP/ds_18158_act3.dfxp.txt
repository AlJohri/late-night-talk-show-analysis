GOOD NIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOOD NIGHT. THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD, BROTHER.
Jon: LET ME SAY THIS, AND YOU KNOW I SEE THIS WITH THE UTMOST, NOT TO SUGGEST AT ANY OTHER POINT IN YOUR LIFE YOU DID NOT LOOK GREAT. BUT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE IN THE BEST SHAPE OF YOUR LIFE, MY FRIEND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I HAVE JUST BEEN RIDING MY BIKE, IT'S BEEN PRETTY SWEET. RIDING MY BIKE IN NEW YORK IS AMAZING BECAUSE I RIDE ON THE WEST SIDE BIKE PATH. I PASS THIS GUY AND HE SAID WAY TO GO, FAT ASS. YEAH, I'M ON DRUGS, IT'S FOR MY PROSTATE.
Jon: YOU REALLY RIDE YOUR BIKE AROUND THE CITY?
IT'S WONDERFUL.
Jon: YOU'RE A MAD MAN.
IT'S WONDERFUL, THE GREATEST WAY TO GET AROUND. PEOPLE GO NO, THAT COULDN'T BE MORK NO.
Jon: HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW, THEY HAVE THE NEW BIKES.
THAT YOU CAN RENT.
Jon: THAT YOU CAN RENT BUT IT'S PEOPLE LIKE FROM BELGIUM THAT DON'T KNOW THE CITY AND DON'T HAVE HELMETS.
THEY'RE LIKE OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO GO NOW, HERE WE GO. AND NEW YORKERS ARE GOING GET THE [BLEEP] OFF THAT BIKE.
Jon: BUT I'M AMAZED THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN HURT.
THEY'RE DOING WONDERFULLY. THERE REALLY IS THIS THING IT WORKS ITSELF OUT. YOU SEE THEM, EVEN ANGELS ARE FLYING BY AND I'M LIKE PLEASE TAKE CARE. IT IS BASICALLY EUROPEANS GOING HOW DO I GET DOWNTOWN? FOLLOW THE NUMBERS. THE NUMBERS GET LOWER, OKAY WHERE ARE YOU, BROOKLYN, WELCOME SO YOU ARE RIGHT NO HELMETS. THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF SAFETY DEVICE.
BUBBLE WRAP.
A SMALL LIKE A LITTLE MAYBE A CONDOM, SOMETHING FUN.
Jon: DON'T YOU THINK NEW YORKERS THEY'RE JUST LIKE IT'S SO HARD EVERY DAY NOT TO JUST GO-- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, LIKE UH.
I RIDE MY BIKE IN L.A. THAT IS WHERE IT GETS CRAZY. I WILL BE RIDING, THE WEIRD THING I HAVE BEEN LIVING IN L.A. NOW BECAUSE OF THE SHOW. I DON'T DO VERY WELL, I GOT STOPPED BY A COP ONCE IN L.A. AND HE GAVE ME A SCRIPT INSTEAD OF A TICKET. HE WAS LIKE HERE, MR. WILLIAMS, HOW ARE YOU. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS PLEASE GIVE IT TO EDDIE MURPHY, THANK YOU. RIDING A BIKE IN L.A. IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU WILL BE, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY REALLY DO, BECAUSE EVERYBODY, THEY'RE ALL TALKING AND TEXTING AND YOU JUST HAVE TO BE LIKE-- .
Jon: BUT YOU'RE FOR REAL. YOU TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY. YOU HAVE DONE BIKE TREKS, LIKE YOU'VE DONE LIKE TWO WEEKS GOING ACROSS CONTINENTS.
NO, NO, I'M NOT THAT SERIOUS.
Jon: REALLY? DIDN'T YOU TRAIN WITH THE GUY WHO WON THE TOUR DE FRANCE GREG LAMOND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND ROAD WITH HIM.
I RODE WITH HIM ONE TIME AND I USED TO RIDE WITH LANCE IN THE OLD DAYS.
Jon: OH, REALLY.
USED TO RIDE BEHIND THE UNIBALLER.
Jon: DID YOU REALLY, YOU RODE WITH LANCE ARMSTRONG.
I RODE WITH HIM ONCE BUT HE WOULD BE ON THE PHONE, HE WOULD BE DOING OTHER STUFF. HE'S HAND FREE. I'M LIKE YOU BASTARD.
Jon: BUT HE TEARS IT UP. WHAT IS THIS, YOU ARE BACK DOING A SERIES.
YES.
Jon: IN L.A..
WHY?
IT'S A JOB, BROTHER. IT'S A JOB BUT ALSO DAVID E KELLY. I HAD A MEETING WITH HIM. HE'S UNBELIEVABLE. A WONDERFUL GUY TO WORK WITH AND HE'S A TOUGH LAUGH THOUGH. HE DOESN'T LAUGH AS MUCH. YOU WILL DO SOMETHING REALLY FUNNY AND THIS IS ALL YOU GET, HA.
Jon: NOTHING.
LIKE YOU KNOW, HA, HA, THAT'S LIKE A STANDING OVATION BUT HE'S A GREAT WRITER AND I THOUGHT OKAY I WILL TAKE A SHOT WITH YOU AND GIVE IT A GO.
Jon: IS IT HARD, WITH A GUY LIKE THAT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY HARD.
WHEN I DID MORK AND MINDY YEARS AGO, YOU GO BACK 32 YEARS AGO WHEN I DID MORK AND MINDY.
Jon: 32 -- >>THERE WAS TAPE BACK THEN THERE ARE ONLY THREE NETWORKS AND THE ONLY THING THAT WAS WIRED WAS ME. I WAS ON EVERYTHING BUT SKATES BUT IT WAS CRAZY.
Jon: I KNOW, I KNOW. I KNOW. I'VE READ THE STORY.
YES, I WENT TO REHAB IN WINE COUNTRY TO KEEP MY OPTIONS OPEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HOW DID YOU FEEL NOW, DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE SOBRIETY AND THE LEARNING THAT YOU'VE DONE IS IT A NEW LEASE ON LIFE, DOES THE BRAIN, WERE YOU WORRIED, I REMEMBER WHEN I QUIT DOING DRUGS AND SMOKING.
YOU REMEMBER THAT NOW.
Jon: YES, I DO. BUT I REMEMBER BEING VERY FEARFUL THAT I WOULD LOSE MY ABILITY TO WORK, TO BE FUNNY OR TO WRITE, THAT I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE SOMEHOW-- CONNECTED.
I THINK THERE IS LIKE A HIGHER PART, ALSO A LOWER POWER. THERE IS THE LOWER POWER THAT GOES TEXT THAT GIRL, WOULD YOU, AND SHOW HER PICTURES OF YOUR JUNK, IT'S OKAY. YEAH. SHE'S NOT GOING TO SHARE THAT WITH ANYBODY. AND THE SAME YOU KNOW, YOU NEED THIS, COME ON NOW, I RELAPSED UP IN ALASKA AND I HAD BEEN SOBER FOR 20 YEARS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I WALKED IN A STORE AND SAW A LITTLE BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS, I WANT THAT WILL BE FINE, THAT WILL BE OKAY. THE MOMENT HI THE FIRST SIP IT WAS LIKE-- WELCOME BACK, [BLEEP]. A WEEK LATER I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH TEN LITTLE BOTTLES OF JACK DANIELS. I SOUNDED LIKE A [BLEEP] WIND CHIME. IT WAS LIKE, AND I GOT REALLY, I GOT DOWN SO QUICK, SO-- I WENT RIGHT TO BLACKOUTS, A MISNOMER, THEY CALL IT BLACKOUTS, IT'S NOT. IT'S LIKE SLEEP WALKING WITH ACTIVITIES. YOUR BRAIN IS GOING WE'RE GOING TO DO STUFF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW. YOU WAKE UP IN A SMALL FIELD GOING WHERE AM I. FEED ME. IT'S CRAZY BUT I THINK THAT'S THE ILLUSION. YOU COME THROUGH IT AND BE LIKE YES, YOU CAN CREATE BETTER, YOU CAN GET BACK INTO IT, THE MAIN OPERATIVE WORD IS FEAR. LIKE YOU SAID, THE FEAR IS THERE AND YOU'RE TRYING TO OVERCOME IT WITH THAT BUT IF YOU CAN DEAL WITH THE FEAR AND REALIZE-- SOME OF IT IS REAL, SOME OF IT ISN'T AND THEN COME THROUGH THAT, YOU GET DEEP, DEEP-- .
Jon: AND THE LIFESTYLE IS SO CONDUCIVE TO THAT BECAUSE WE ARE GENERALLY BORED INDIVIDUALS AND WE'RE WORKING 40 MINUTES A NIGHT IN WINNIPEG FOR TWO STRAIGHT WEEKS. NO. THAT IS --
DON'T MAKE THEM ANGRY, THEY'RE CANADIAN. CANADA YOU'RE THE NICEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, YOU'RE LIKE A SWEET APARTMENT OVER A METH LAB. IT'S LIKE-- BUT IT IS-- .
Jon: SO DURING THE DAY YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOURSELF AND YOU THINK LIKE I BET I COULD MAKE A CRACK PIPE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. IT'S LIKE HEY, WHY DON'T WE HAVE A PROJECT.
WHEN DID YOUR VOICE HAVE ACTIVITIES. I'M MAKING A CRACK PIPE.
Jon: YOU SEND TO CAMP AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I'M SO DELIGHTED FOR YOU. AND I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE IT.
YOU TOO, CAN I TELL THEM WHAT YOU SHOWED ME.
Jon: WELL, YEAH, WE WERE LOOKING.
I JUST SAW A MOVIE THAT MY BROTHERMAN DIRECTED.
Jon: WE WERE LOOKING AT IT IN THE BACK.
YEAH, BOSS.
Jon: IT'S GETTING THERE. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN. THE CRAZY ONCE, THURSDAY AT 9:00 ON CBS. THE GREAT ROBIN WILLIAMS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
