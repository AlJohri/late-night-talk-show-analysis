(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. GOD, YAWEH, ADUNAI. WHATEVER YOU CALL THE SUPREME BEING I THINK EVERYONE CAN AGREE IT'S A DUDE WITH A SWEET WHITE BEARD THAT LIVES IN THE CLOUDS. HOW CAN THAT BE WRONG? AND THAT DUDE HAS REALLY ONLY TWO WAYS OF GETTING HIS MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE. THE POPE, GOD'S INFALLIBLE EMISSARY ON EARTH, GOD'S INCREDIBLY FALLIBLE EMISSARIES ON EARTH, THE REPUBLICANS.
AND I THINK EVEN WHEN LIFE BEGINS IN THAT HORRIBLE SITUATION OF RAPE, THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT GOD INTENDED TO HAPPEN.
Jon: REALLY? I THINK EVEN IN THAT SITUATION GOD'S LIKE WHOA, WHOA, WAIT A SECOND. I'LL TAKE CREDIT FOR SUPER BOWL WINS AND LATIN GRAMMIES BUT I'M GOING TO GO ALLEN SMITHY ON THE RAPE BABY THING. NOW TRADITIONALLY THESE TWO HOLY CONDUITS HAVE BEEN ON THE SAME PAGE. BUT WITH THE ASCENSION OF THIS NEW INCREDIBLY HUMBLE WASHING THE POOR'S FEET, SLEEP ON A CONVERTIBLE SOFA, DO YOU NEED A RIDE TO THE AIRPORT POPE, THINGS MIGHT BE CHANGING.
IN A BLUNT INTERVIEW IN THE JESUIT MAGAZINE AMERICA POPE FRANCIS SAYS THE CHURCH CANNOT BE OBSESSED WITH THE ISSUES THAT DIVIDE IT. WE CANNOT INSIST ONLY ON ISSUES RELATED TO ABORTION, GAY MARRIAGE AND THE USE OF CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS.
Jon: OH, ABORTION, GAY MARRIAGE AND CONTRACEPTION. WHAT COULD HE BE REFERRING TO.
REPUBLICANS ARE CALLING THE PRESIDENT'S NEW RULES ON CONTRACEPTION A WAR ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
THE AMENDMENT THAT MAYBE GOT THE MOST ATTENTION WOULD LET SAME SEX COUPLES SPONSOR THEIR PARTNERS. REPUBLICANS SAY IT COULD KILL THE BILL.
THE GOVERNMENT COULD SHOULD DOWN ON THE ISSUE OF ABORTION.
THE ISSUE OF ABORTION.
ABORTION.
ABORTION.
A BIRTH CONTROL ISSUE.
CONTRACEPTIVES.
I WOULD RIGHT NOW BE OPPOSED TO GAY MARRIAGE.
MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN.
THE FREEDOM TO BELIEVE IN TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE, THAT WAS TAUGHT IN THE BIBLE.
Jon: POLYGAMY-- YOU KNOW, FORGET IT, BY THE WAY, A LESS HUMBLE POPE WOULD PROBABLY MAKE HIMSELF THE COVER OF EVERY MONTH'S ISSUE OF, YOU KNOW, THAT MAGAZINE. (LAUGHTER) POPRAH. BUT BACK TO MY MAIN POINT. HERE'S POPE FRANCIS TALKING ABOUT POOR PEOPLE. >
THE MEASURE OF THE GREATNESS OF THE SOCIETY IS FOUND IN THE WAY IT TREATS THOSE MOST IN NEED. THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING APART FROM THEIR POVERTY.
Jon: WOW. I GUESS THAT IS ONE MEASURE OF A GREAT SOCIETY. I MEAN YOU COULD ALSO GO BY HOW MUCH IT CAN BENCH. OR THE NUMBER OF TWITTER FOLLOWERS. BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD ONE. SO REPUBLICANS, THE TOPIC IS THE POOR. SURVEY SAYS --
THE HOUSE VOTED TO SLASH THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM BY NEARLY $40 BILLION OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.
MY MOTIVATION IS ONLY BEEN TO INTRODUCE THE BLESSING OF WORK TO ABLE-BODIED PEOPLE.
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT SCRIPTURE. AND A LOT OF TALK ABOUT GOD'S PLAN.
GOD CREATED ADAM PLACED HIM IN THE GARDEN TO WORK IT. WORK IS NOT A PENALTY. WORK IS A BLESSING.
Jon: YOU KNOW THAT'S SO TRUE. IT REMINDED ME OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT. CONSIDER THE LILLIES. THEY TOIL NOT SO [BLEEP] THEM LAZY LILLIES. WITH THEIR STAMMENS AND PISTELS, THOSE ARE ONLY THE ONLY TWO PARTS I REMEMBER ON FLOWERS BUT COASTING ON GOVERNMENT ISSUE SUN AND RAIN. FOR SOME REASON GOD HAS DECIDED TO GIVE ONE MESSAGE TO THE POPE, AND AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MESSAGE TO THE WAYS HE WORKS IS SO MYSTERIOUS. NOW I GUESS YOU COULD SAY BOY, YOU KNOW, YOUR IDEOLOGY IS RIGID AND OUTDATED WHEN THE HEAD OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT JUST GOT AROUND TO APOLOGIZING TO GALILEO SHOWS MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN YOU BUT LOOK, YOU ARE BOTH GOD'S MESSENGERS WHO IS TO SAY ONE OF YOU IS RIGHT AND ONE OF YOU IS WRONG. DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF GOD'S WILL, AS LONG AS THERE IS NO FUNDAMENTAL SCHISM BETWEEN THIS POPE AND  REPUBLICANS.
AN OFF-THE-CUFF COMMENT WHILE VISITING ONE OF ITALY'S POOREST AREAS POPE FRANCIS DENOUNCED WHAT HE CALLED IDOLATRY OF MONEY AND BIG BUSINESS.
OH NO, NOW THE [BLEEP] IS ON. YOU BETTER WATCH IT! OR WE'RE GOING TO END UP INVADING THE VATICAN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
