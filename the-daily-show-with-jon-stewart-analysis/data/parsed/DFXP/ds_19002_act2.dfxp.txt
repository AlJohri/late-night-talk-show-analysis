Jon: WE ARE BACK. OBAMACARE, OBAMACARE INSURANCE MARKETPLACE IS OPEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY TODAY BUT THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION. JASON JONES REPORTS.
AFTER YEARS OF ARGUING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, A SUPREME COURT RULING, 41 ATTEMPTS AT A CONGRESSIONAL REPEAL AND NOW A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, THE HEALTHCARE DEBATE COMES DOWN TO TWO SIDES, THE BORING SUBSTANCE OF OBAMACARE SUPPORTERS LIKE ANNE PHILLIPIC AND THE PUNCHY SPUNK OF CONSERVATIVES LIKE GINA LOWDEN.
WE ARE OFFERING QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH COVERAGE FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
OBAMACARE IS DANGEROUS. OBAMACARE IS A PONZI SCHEME.
THERE ARE OVER 41 MILLION PEOPLE WHO STAND TO BENEFIT THIS FALL WITH THE NEW HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS THAT ARE COMING. OBAMACARE, IS BAD FOR AMERICA.
OBAMACARE IS MORE LIKE OBAMA DOESN'T CARE. >>SEE YOU ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THEM AT REDUCING COMPLICATED IDEAS INTO MEANINGLESS PHRASES. AS WE LIKE TO SAY IN THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT, WE CAN EXPLAIN IT TO YOU, WE JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT FOR YOU.
WELL THAT IS VERY CONDESCENDING.
WITH ONLY THREE MONTHS UNTIL THE LAW KICKS IN ALL THAT MATTERS NOW IS WHO HAS THE CLEARER MESSAGE.
STARTING OCTOBER 1ST, THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACES ARE GOING TO LAUNCH. THEY ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO COVER THE ESSENTIALS, YOU CAN'T BE DENIED BECAUSE OF A PREEXISTING CONDITION LIKE ASTHMA OR EVEN CANCER, AND FINANCIAL HELP IS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE.
THEY ARE OFFERING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU ARE OFFERING.
OH, WE HAVE A FREE MARKET. THE PRIVATE SYSTEM HAS WORKED REALLY WELL FOR A LONG TIME.
YOU KNOW NORMALLY I DO THESE INTERVIEWS AND I JUST IRONICALLY NOD AND AGREE WITH WHATEVER THE PERSON IS SAYING BUT, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN WITH THAT ONE. LET ME TRY AND GET IN CHARACTER. OH. YOU THINK THE EXISTING PROGRAM IS WORKING JUST FINE?
YES. RARELY EVER IS A NONFREE MARKET OPTION THE REAL ANSWER. I MEAN, UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR ANNUAL BREAST EXAM TO TAKE PLACE WITH THE TSA.
NO. I CAN'T DO IT. I CAN'T STAY IN CHARACTER.
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. THAT'S JUST (BLEEP).
WHO IS RIGHT?  AND WHO IS WRONG?  THE ONLY WAY TO SETTLE THIS MAJOR POLICY DEBATE IS.
LIKE WE ALWAYS DO. WITH COMMERCIALS.
WE ARE ALL KIND OF PEOPLE. WE ARE NEW YORKERS. EVERYONE DESERVES AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE.
TO FIND OUT HOW YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS CAN GET IT GO TO NEW YORK STATE OF HEALTH.
IS THAT PRO HEALTHCARE OR ANTI-HEALTHCARE?
IT IS -- IT IS --PRO
FOR NEW YORKERS?
YES.
YOU DON'T SUGGEST HEALTHCARE IN NEW YORK?  YOU TELL THEM.
AND THIS IS HOW. HI I'M HARVEY KEITEL. BUY SOME  (BLEEP) INSURANCE, NEW YORK. WE HAVE BOTULISM, E BOLA, THREE TYPES OF HEPATITIS AND THAT IS JUST THE 6 TRAIN.
LOG ON AND SIGN UP YOU [BLEEP] BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, I WILL COME AFTER YOU AND GRAB YOUR LITTLE (BLEEP) HEAD AND BEAT (BLEEP).
THAT IS THE SHORT VERSION. HE GOES ON LIKE THAT.
AND NOT TO BE OUTDONE THE ANTI-OBAMACARE FORCES HAVE THEIR OWN ADS. IT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.
TAKE A LOOK.
AHH!
EFFECTIVE!
I AM ASSUMING IT IS A METAPHOR.
WELL, SURE.
BECAUSE SHE IS NOT ACTUALLY GONNA GET RAPED.
I THINK METAPHORICALLY, OBAMACARE IS GOING TO DO SOME REALLY UGLY THINGS. WHEN YOU HAVE GOT GOVERNMENT IN YOUR EXAM ROOM, I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. IT IS NOT THE PLACE OF GOVERNMENT. THIS IS A PRIVATE AFFAIR, OBVIOUSLY.
IT IS A PRIVATE AFFAIR. JUST THROWING THIS OUT HERE. ARE YOU PRO-CHOICE?
AM I -- IT DEPENDS ON WHAT ISSUE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. I THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION WHICH UPHOLDS A RIGHT-TO-LIFE.
I GET IT. IT'S UNCLE SAME STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM MY VAGINA UNLESS WE WANT TO DO CERTAIN THINGS WITH IT THEN GET ALL UP IN MY VAGINA?
THIS IS SO CONFUSING. THERE IS ONE MESSAGE FOR THE HEALTHY AND ONE FOR THE YOUNG AND ONE FOR THE OLD. SO I FOUND A SPOKESMAN WHO COULD EMBODY ALL THESE DEMOS SO I MADE MY OWN COMMERCIAL.
HELLO, I AM JOHNNY KNOXVILLE, AND AS SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS HOW YOUNG PEOPLE BEHAVE, I KNOW RIGHT NOW YOU FEEL -- (BLEEP)!
NOW I'M OLDER, AND A FATHER. EVERYONE SHOULD BE COVERED.
ABSOLUTELY.
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN SOMETHING UNEXPECTED -- THEN AGAIN, YOU ARE YOUNG. WHAT IS THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN?  OH, NO! IF YOU DO OPT OUT RESPONSIBLE ADULTS  HAVE TO PAY WHEN THE DO STUPID --
OH!  (BLEEP)! >>WHY CAN'T IT BE SINGLE PAYER COVERAGE? [ APPLAUSE ]
