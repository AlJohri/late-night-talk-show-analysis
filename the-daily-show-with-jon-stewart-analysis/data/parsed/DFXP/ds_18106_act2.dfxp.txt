Jon: WELCOME BACK. CABLE NEWS, CABLE NEWS, IT'S  LOUD, IT'S VAPID BUT AT  LEAST IT'S AVAILABLE-- WHAT MORE COULD ANYONE WANT AL  MADRIGAL HAS THE SHOCKING  END.
EASY ACCESS TO FRESH AND  HEALTHY FOOD IS A CHALLENGE  FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. BUT SOME FARMERS IN SOUTHERN  CALIFORNIA THINK THEY HAVE  SOLVED THE PROBLEM BY USING  HYDROPONICS. AN THEY'RE EVEN EMPLOYING  U.S. VETERANS TO DO IT.
WE'RE ABLE TO DELIVER A  MUCH MORE NUTRITIOUS, FASTER  GROWING, TASTIER AND MORE ROBUST --
WAIT A SECOND. HOLD ON. I THINK I KNOW THIS GUY'S  BLOATED ANGRIER BROTHER.
THIS IS NOT SOME OPINION. THIS IS A MATHEMATICAL FACT. ARE YOU WASTING VALUABLE  OXYGEN.
CAN WE PLEASE CUT OFF  THIS MAN'S MICROPHONE. HE HAS NO INTENTION OF  ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS.
NO, THAT IS I DID LAN MAD  I AGAIN FROM MSNBC. BUT WHAT HE IS DOING HERE?
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE  INCENTIVE OR DESIRE FROM THE  LEFT OR RIGHT WING MEDIA APPARATUS TO ACTUALLY  RESOLVE ANY PROBLEMS. IT BECAME APPARENT THAT  THERE WAS MORE VALUE IN  WORKING WITH VETERANS TO  DEPLOY A HIGH TECHNOLOGY HYDROPONIC ORGANIC FARMING  SYSTEM THAN THERE WAS IN  PARTICIPANTING IN A HOLLOW  POLITICAL DEBATE.
SO YOU THINK MAKING A  FARM THAT EMPLOYS VETERANS  IS MORE FULFILLING THAN CABLE NEWS?
THAT'S CORRECT.
IT IS LIKE THE INCREDIBLE  HULK. NO ONE CARES ABOUT  BILL --BY. I WANT TO SEE YOU POUNDING  YOUR FIST ON THE DESK,  YELLING AT SOME BLOND CHICK.
WHY SIT AROUND ARGUING  WITH PEOPLE IN A CIRCLE WHEN  WE COULD ACTUALLY BE BUILDING GREENHOUSES  CREATING JOBS.
I CAN STOP YOU THERE? THIS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT. YOU CAN BRING THAT IN,  PLEASE?
THANKS.
NASS'S BETTER. WE CAN TALK LIKE NORMAL  PEOPLE NOW.
WE'RE ON A FARM.
TRUST ME, I WORK IN  TELEVISION, YOU DON'T, ANY  MORE.
EVEN HIS FORMER  COLLEAGUES CAN'T BELIEVE  WHAT HE'S TURNING HIS BACK  ON.
WHAT WOULD POSSESS AN  ANCHOR OF A DAILY TELEVISION  PROGRAM TO WALK AWAY FROM ALL HIS APPARENT SUCCESS.
BUT DE WALK AWAY. AND IT WAS SHOCKING JUST HOW  FAR HE HAD FALLEN.
WAIT A SECOND, ARE THOSE [BLEEP].
YES, THEY ARE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH CROCK.
NOTHING IF YOU ARE THREE. ARE YOU A GROWN MAN.
WHAT IF I WAS BAREFOOT,.
FLIP A COIN.
WHAT KIND OF [BLEEP] AM  I?
IT WAS BECOMING CLEAR,  SINCE HE CHECKED OUT OF HIS  OLD LIFE HE HAD FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING THAT TRULY  MATTERS.
BASICALLY WHAT YOU ARE  LOOKING AT IS A SYSTEM THAT  USE 90% LESS WATER, GROWS THREE TIMES AS MUCH FOOD AT  THREE TIMES AS QUICKLY.
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE  OF THAT ISSUE, WHAT DO THOSE  PEOPLE THINK?
WHAT DOW MEAN OTHER SIDE.
THE SIDE THAT DISAGREES  WITH WHATEVER YOU ARE SAYING.
WE'RE ACTUALLY JOINED BY  KEITH MYERS FROM LOVIT,  TEXAS WHO IS A PLUMBER AND-- WATER ALL THE TIME. KEITH WA, DO YOU THINK ABOUT  DYLAN'S PLAN FOR A WATERLESS  SOCIETY.
BEING A PLUMBER I MAKE MY  LIVING OFF WATER. YOU TAKE AWAY THE WATER, YOU  TAKE AWAY MY JOB.
YEAH, I DON'T THINK  THERE'S ACTUALLY AN ISSUE. THERE IS A MEANINGFUL WATER  SHORTAGE AROUND THE WORLD. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS  CREATING JOBNESS.
I WILL HAVE TO STOP YOU  THERE, WE TAKE A QUICK BREAK  WITH MORE ON THE WATER ISSUE, YOU ARE WATCHING TBS 247.
BLOEP BLOEP.
STEP UP. BRING IT. FARMING IS [BLEEP] WITH YOUR  HEAD.
AND OLD McDONALD HAD  PLENTY OF CRITIQUES FOR THE  STATE OF CABLE NEWS.
TOO FOCUSED ON FEELINGS  AND NOT FOCUSED ENOUGH ON  FACT. THE SAME PUNDITS THAT SORT  OF ECHO WHAT THEY THINK,  THEY WILL USE PANELS TO  BASICALLY TO MAKE THE AUDIENCE FEEL THAT THERE ARE  PEOPLE LIKE THEM THAT --
TRUE, LET'S FIND OUT.
I LIKE THE PANELS BECAUSE  IT'S LIKE A TEAM SPORT. I'M THERE TO ROOT FOR MY  TEAM.
I LIKE TO KNOW OTHER  VIEWPOINTS, AND IT MAKES ME  FEEL USUALLY THAT I'M RIGHT. AND I ALSO GET BORED IF IT'S  JUST ONE PERSON TALKING.
SO THIS PANEL IS PRO  PANEL.
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH.
YES.
DESPITE ALL THE EVIDENCE,  HE MAINTAINS HE MADE THE  RIGHT DECISION.
I FIND THE WORK AS I SAID  TO BE INCREDIBLY FULFILLING.
BUT IS HE TELLING THE  TRUTH?
WE'RE JOINED BY BODY  LANGUAGE EXPERT NOVA REID. NOVA, DO YOU THINK DYLAN  HERE IS TRULY FULFILLED?
HIS BODY LANGUAGE IS  LEANING FORWARD, HIS  SHOULDERS ARE SLIGHTLY  JOSTLING FROM SIDE TO SIDE. SOMEBODY THAT FULFILLED,  THEIR BODY LANGUAGED IS  LEANING BACK.
MORE RELAXED.
DYLAN WHAT DO YOU THINK.
I THINK I WAS WALKING UP  A HILL. SO I LEAN BACK ON THE HILL I  WILL FALL DOWN, I HAVE TO  LEAN FORWARD TO WALK UP THE  HILL.
SHE'S THE EXPERT.
NOT FULFILLED, MAN.
WALKING UP A HILL, BRO.
IN THE END, WE ALL HAVE  TO REALIZE THAT IT'S THE  AUDIENCE WHO CALLS THE  SHOTS.
SO SHOW OF HANDS, HOW  MANY PEOPLE WANT TO SEE  DYLAN BACK ON TELEVISION?
THAT GUY [BLEEP] HATES  YOU.
BUT DON'T WORRY, FARMER,  IF YOU EVER GET TIRED OF  HIRING VETERANS AND FIXING WORLD HUNGER, JUST REMEMBER  THIS GUY IS OUT THERE,  WAITING FOR ANOTHER SHOT.
AL MADRIGAL,
