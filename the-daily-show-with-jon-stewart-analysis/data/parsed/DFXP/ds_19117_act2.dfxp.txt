Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, OBVIOUSLY YESTERDAY IN OREGON THERE WAS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY, ANOTHER SCHOOL SHOOTING, A STUDENT DEAD AND A TEACHER WOUNDED.
BREAKING TONIGHT, A STUNNING DEVELOPMENT.
I... YOU CAN SEE I'M SPEECHLESS.
THIS IS SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE NEVER SAW COMING.
IT IS A SHOCK.
NUMB FROM THE SHOCK.
Jon: I'M SORRY THAT WAS THE MEDIA RESPONDING TO AN INCUMBENT ACTUALLY LOSING AN ELECTION. THIS IS HOW THEY REACTED TO ANOTHER SCHOOL SHOOTING.
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER SCHOOL SHOOTING.
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER SCHOOL SHOOTING. THIS STORY IS GETTING OLD.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? IT'S NOT LIKE AN INCUMBENT LOST AN ELECTION. I MEAN, THAT... THIS IS HOW INURED WE'VE BECOME TO THE VIOLENCE. THERE HAVE BEEN 74 SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN JUST THE 18 MONTHS SINCE NEWTOWN. 74! YOU COULD NAME EVERY BASKIN ROBINS FLAVOR FOR EACH ONE, AND NOT ONLY WOULD YOU STILL HAVE PLENTY LEFT OVER, YOU WOULD BE THE OWNER OF THE WORLD'S MOST DEPRESSING ICE CREAM PARLOR. NOW, OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO WAY TO COMPLETELY ESCAPE THIS. BUT, WE CAN AT LEAST TAKE A SADNESS BREAK, FEATURING STORIES THAT SOUND LIKE THEY WOULD END VIOLENTLY BUT DON'T. IN OUR NEW SEGMENT, "YEAH, WE'LL TAKE IT."
A CONNECTICUT MOTHER IS UNDER ARREST, ACCUSED OF ALLOWING HER CHILD BRING A GRENADE TO SCHOOL.
Jon: I SEE YOU TENSING UP. HANG IN THERE. TRUST ME.
LISA MIGUEL'S 12-YEAR-OLD SON BROUGHT HIS GRANDFATHER'S MILITARY SOUVENIR FOR SHOW-AND-TELL AT THE STRATFORD ACADEMY. HER MOTHER THOUGHT IT WAS A DUD, BUT THE STATE POLICE SAYS IT WAS A LIVE SIMULATOR GRENADE, WHICH CAN BLOW UP AND INJURE PEOPLE WITHIN A 20-FOOT RADIUS.
Jon: SEE? HE WASN'T THREATENING HIS CLASSMATES. HE JUST HAD A LIVE GRENADE BY ACCIDENT. WE'LL TAKE IT. [LAUGHTER] PRETTY GOOD SHOW-AND-TELL. YOU GOT TO ADMIT. ALL RIGHT. SO, WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT STORY IN... OH, BOY, HIGH DEGREE OF NON-SADNESS DIFFICULTY. FLORIDA.
THIS PUBLIX PARKING LOT ON OAKLAND PARK BOULEVARD IS WHERE THE ROAD RAGE STARTED.
Jon: OH, BOY. FLORIDA, ROAD RAGE. I THINK I SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING, AND IT'S A VERY DARK PLACE.
GALATIS SAID IN THIS STATEMENT THAT HE FELT THREATENED BY THE DRIVER AND THE PEOPLE INSIDE THE CAR.
Jon: OH, BOY. EONS OF NATURAL SELECTION HAVE HONED MANY SPECIES INTO HYPEREFFICIENT KILLERS, CHIEF AMONG THEM THE THREATENED FLORIDIAN. I'M JUST GOING TO WRITE DOWN A BODY COUNT RIGHT HERE AND WE'LL JUST SEE HOW CLOSE I CAN GET.
THE DRIVER STATED THAT SHE WAS UPSET THAT T. GALATIS CALLED HER AND THE PASSENGERS IN HER VEHICLE THE "N" WORD AND DID NOT WANT HIM TO GET AWAY WITH IT.
Jon: OH, AND THE N-WORD IS INVOLVED. I'M JUST GOING TO ADD A ZERO TO MY ORIGINAL ESTIMATION. MAYBE TWO. ALRIGHT, HOW MANY FUNERALS ARE WE PLANNING HERE?
WHILE USING RACIAL SLURS IS OBVIOUSLY OFFENSIVE, IT IS NOT A CRIME, SO NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED.
Jon: WHAT? THIS WHOLE CONTROVERSY IS NOW ONLY ABOUT A RACIAL SLUR? FLORIDA, ROAD RAGE AND A WHITE GUY FEELING THREATENED ALL GOT TOGETHER IN A SINGLE STORY AND NOBODY WAS MURDERED? FLORIDA, I HAVE NEVER BEEN PROUDER OF YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HOW DID THIS MIRACLE HAPPEN? YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S... WHY DON'T WE... WHY DON'T WE HEAR FROM THE WIFE OF THE ACCUSED "N" WORD USER.
I READ THE POLICE REPORT. IT SAYS THAT YOUR HUSBAND USED THE "N" WORD.
AND WHAT DID THEY SAY TO ME? WHITE [BLEEPED], I'LL SLICE YOU UP.
SO DID HE USE THE "N" WORD? DID YOU GUYS AT ANY POINT USE THE "N" WORD? IS IT OKAY TO USE THE "N" WORD?
Jon: ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10, HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE "N" WORD? WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THE "N" WORD TO A FRIEND? IF THE "N" WORD AND THE "C" WORD WERE BOTH DROWNING IN A LAKE AND YOU ONLY HAD TIME TO SAVE ONE WORD, WHICH WORD, MA'AM, WHICH WORD WOULD YOU SAVE, "C" WORD OR... I'M GOING TO PUT YOU DOWN FOR [BLEEPED]. ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S NEXT? I'M ON A ROLL, BABY.
THE LARGEST AIRPORT IN PAKISTAN WAS BURNING THROUGH THE NIGHT, A STUNNING ATTACK ON THE CARGO TERMINAL OF KARACHI AIRPORT BY MEN WEARING SUICIDE VESTS, ARMED WITH MACHINE GUNS AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS. AT LEAST 23 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.
Jon: WAIT. THAT'S JUST HORRIBLE IN EVERY WAY. HOW IS THAT? NO, NO,, NO TAKE THAT OUT OF. THERE THERE'S NO WAY. WE'RE NOT TAKING THAT. THAT'S A TRAGIC INCIDENT. I'M NOT GOING TO PUT A POSITIVE SPIN ON THAT. THAT'S APPARENTLY THE JOB OF THE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT.
WE WERE ABLE TO BLOCK THESE TERRORISTS AND WERE ABLE TO MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE DONE TO OUR AIRPORT.
SO YOUR GOVERNMENT REGARDS THIS AS A SUCCESS STORY?
WHAT I HAVE SHARED WITH YOU, THE INTENT AND THE PLANNING AND THE AMOUNT OF WEAPONRY THAT WAS RECOVERED THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO USE AGAINST THE AIRPLANE, THAT SHOWS IT WAS A SUCCESS.
Jon: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT BECAUSE THE TALIBAN DIDN'T GET TO DETONATE ALL OF THEIR EXPLOSIVES, YOU'RE PUTTING THIS ONE IN THE WIN COLUMN. ALL RIGHT. PRETTY WIDE DEFINITION OF VICTORY. IT'S LIKE SAYING, SURE, GODZILLA DESTROYED SAN FRANCISCO, BUT I DON'T SEE A GIANT, RADIOACTIVE [BLEEPED] ON THE RUBBLE. ALRIGHT, THIS HAS GOTTEN WAY TOO DARK. LOOK, WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AT RELATIVELY GOOD NEWS. GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN WORK WITH.
ON THE HUNT FOR AN INTRUDER, POLICE IN BRIGHTON ARE LOOKING FOR A SUSPECT WHO'S BREAKING INTO HOMES NEAR BOSTON COLLEGE.
Jon: I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO GO WELL.
POLICE SAY THE SUSPECT BREAKS IN BUT DOESN'T TAKE ANYTHING. VICTIMS SAY HE JUST TICKLES THEM, THEN TAKES OFF. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THANK YOU, BOSTON WEIRDO, YOU'VE SAVED THE DAY. BECAUSE WHILE YOU MAY BE TERRORIZING THE PEOPLE OF BOSTON FOR YOUR OWN CREEPY GRATIFICATION, AT LEAST YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL TAKE IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
