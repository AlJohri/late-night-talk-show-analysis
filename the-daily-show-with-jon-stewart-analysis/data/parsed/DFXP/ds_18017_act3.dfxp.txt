(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  TONIGHT, THE BEST-SELLING AUTHOR  OF THE PSYCHOPATH TEST, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "LOST AT SEA, THE  JOHN RONSON MYSTERIES."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM JOHN RONSON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN!
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, LET ME  THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT IN  THESE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS. I MET YOUR FAMILY BACKSTAGE. LOVELY PEOPLE. AND VERY KIND OF YOU TO COME  HERE. AS THE AUDIENCE AS WELL ON A  DIFFICULT NIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I WAS IN THE VILLAGE, YOU  WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD OF ME. I STARTED TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OF  MY INSTAGRAM OMINOUS FILTER. (LAUGHTER)  THE TIME I THOUGHT THIS WAS  REALLY BAD IS WHEN YOU NO LONGER  NEEDED THE OMINOUS FILTER. (LAUGHTER)  AND THEN THE NEXT DAY I WAS  TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS WITH MY  "EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY"  FILTER.
Jon: WHEN DID THEY DEVELOP  THE "EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE  OKAY" FITTER? AND CAN THEY USE IT DOWNTOWN,  PLEASE? THAT'S THE SAD PART. YOU HAVE DEVELOPED SOMETHING,  IT'S ALMOST A NEW CATEGORY OF,  LIKE, INVESTIGATIVE SATIRE.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU GO AND YOU EXPLORE  WITH GREAT INTELLECTUAL  CURIOSITY, YOU FIND A WAY TO  MAKE IT FUNNY. THIS BOOK IS FILLED WITH THESE  STORIES. YOU SPENT TIME-- IT'S NOT IN  THIS ONE, IT'S GOING TO BE IN  THE PAPER BACK, SUPERHERO.
WELL, YEAH, I PUT MYSELF IN  EXTREMELY TKAEUPBG WHITE HOUSE  SITUATIONS WHICH IS RIDICULOUS  BECAUSE I SUFFER FROM ANXIETY SO I WAS WITH A SUPERHERO CALLED  PHOENIX JONES, A REAL LIFE  SUPERHERO, DRESSES UP IN A  SUPERHERO AND FIGHTS CRIME.
Jon: HE'S A CRIME THWARTER?
HE'S A CRIME THWARTER. BUT THE WEEKEND I WAS WITH HIM  THERE WAS NO CRIME TO THWART, HE  WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE  FRUSTRATED. AT ONE POINT HE HEARD A WOMAN  BEING ATTACKED AND HE WENT IDEA  I CAN'T TELLSY!"  AND HE RAN RUNNING TOWARDS HER.
Jon: SORRY, BACK THAT UP?
YAHTZE, THAT'S HIS SUPERHERO  CRY. AND HE SCREECHES TO A HALT AND  THEN THE WOMAN JUST VANISHED SO  THAT WAS NO GOOD. BUT THEN HE WAS SO ANNOYED THAT  THERE WAS NO CRIME TO FIGHT HE  TOOK ME TO BREAK UP A GANG OF 30  ARMED CRACK DEALERS. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  I HAD NO IDEA. AND HE HAD A BULLETPROOF  SUPERHERO SUIT, I HAD A  CARDIGAN. SO HE WALKED --
Jon: WHAT WAS THE WEAVE ON  THE CARDIGAN? WAS IT A TIGHT WEAVE?
NOT EVEN THAT. IT WAS NOT --
Jon: DID YOU HAVE IT OPEN  OR DID YOU BUTTON?
WELL, I WAS VERY BUTTONED AS  YOU CAN IMAGINE.
Jon: SO THESE CRACK DEALERS  ARE GOING "WHAT ARE YOU DOING  COMING HERE TO OUR BLOCK WITH  YOUR STUPID OUTFIT? THIS IS NOT FUN AND GAMES FOR  US, THIS IS REAL LIFE."  AND WHAT I WAS DOING WASES  OSTENTATIOUSLY NODDING IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CRACK DEALERS  IN THE HOPE THAT IF THE SHOOTING  STARTED THEY WOULD CONSIDERATELY  IGNORE ME.
Jon: (LAUGHS)
IN THE END PHOENIX WON  BECAUSE THE CRACK DEALERS SAID  "IF YOU DON'T GO, WE'RE GOING TO  KILL YOU." AND PHOENIX SAID "I'M NOT  GOING."  AND THEY SAID "WELL, WE'RE GOING  TO HAVE TO GO HOME."  SO HE REALLY IS A SUPERHERO.
Jon: THE CRACK DEALERS  LEFT?
THE CRACK DEALERS LEFT, YEAH.
Jon: PHOENIX WON.
I KNOW! I KNOW!
Jon: IF YOU ACT CRAZY AT A  CERTAIN POINT THEY'RE LIKE  "THERE MUST BE SOMETHING HERE,  MAYBE HE IS A SUPERHERO, HE HAS LASERS OR SOMETHING AND CLEARLY  HE'S HERE WITH WATTSON SO THAT'S  GOT TO BE LIKE --"  (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE IN A SUPERHERO SITUATION I CAN SEE YOU BEING AN EXCELLENT  SIDEKICK WITH GREAT -- LIKE,  YOU'RE THE GADGET GUY.
I WASN'T AN EXCELLENT  SIDEKICK THAT NIGHT, I'LL TELL  YOU.
Jon: DID YOU YELL AT  PHOENIX AFTERWARDS?
NO, BUT WHEN I GOT BACK TO  THE HOTEL MY KNEES BUCKLED AND I  HAD TO MOLD MYSELF UP ON THE  CHAIR. I'M 45. THIS IS WHAT THE CRACK DEALERS  WERE SAYING, THEY WERE SAYING,  LOOK, THIS IS NOT HOW YOU WANT  TO DIE. (LAUGHTER)  BELIEVE US. THIS IS NOT HOW -- YOUR MOTHER  WILL SEE YOU IN A CASKET AND  THIS THIS WAS A RIDICULOUS-- I'M  PARAPHRASING --
Jon: SURE.
--WAY TO DIE.
Jon: DID THEY MENTION HOW  YOU WOULD WANT TO DIE?
THEY SAID WHEN YOU'RE VERY,  VERY OLD, WHEN YOU'REN UP HAVING  ADVENTURES.
Jon: HERE'S THE THING ABOUT  CRACK DEALERS PEOPLE DON'T  RECOGNIZE. A LOT OF WISDOM THERE. A LOT OF GOOD WISDOM. A LOT OF REALLY NICE -- DO YOU  KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ANY OF YOUR  SUBJECTS? IS THERE A RAPPORT THAT'S  DEVELOPD?
I LIKE TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH  PEOPLE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT  PEOPLE TO FEEL -- YOU KNOW, I  SPEND ALL MY TIME WITH CRAZY PEOPLE BUT I NEVER LOOK DOWN AT  THEM, I NEVER FEEL  IMPERIALISTIC, I ALWAYS FEEL  LIKE I CONNECT WITH THEM ON A NEUROTIC LEVEL AND SO I LIKE IT  WHEN THE PEOPLE --
Jon: DO YOU, WHEN YOU'RE  WITH THEM, REFER TO THEM AS  "CRAZY PEOPLE" OR WHEN YOU'RE  WITH THEM DO YOU SAY "GREAT IDEA, PHOENIX! LET'S GO A TO A CRACK HOUSE."
I DIDN'T SAY THAT. AT ONE POINT WHAT HE WANTED TO  DO WAS GET SOME -- GET A HOTEL  ROOM -- HE WAS WITH TWO OTHER  MASKED SUPERHEROES.
Jon: (LAUGHS)  WAIT, WHO WERE THE OTHER TWO?
PITCH BLACK AND GHOST.
Jon: PITCH BLACK AND GHOST?
YEAH, ALL MASKED. HE WANTED TO GET A HOTEL ROOM  AND HE WANTED TO CALL UP SOME  PROSTITUTES AND THEN WHEN THEY  ARRIVED HE WOULD ASK THEM IF THEY WANTED HIS HELP ESCAPING  THE WEB OF PROSTITUTION BUT I  SAID TO THEM, LOOK, THIS IS A  REALLY BAD IDEA BECAUSE WHEN THE PROSTITUTES -- A IT'S GOING TO  BE LIKE AN HOUR AFTER THEIR  NIGHT AND, B, THEY'RE GOING TO  GET HERE, SEE MEN IN MASKS, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE THINKING  SUPERHEROES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I'M TELLING YOU, MAN,  INVESTIGATIVE SATIRE. YOU'RE LIKE -- YOU KNOW HOW  RICHARD ENGEL GOES INTO SYRIA,  CRAWLS IN? YOU DO THAT FOR COMEDY. AND I ADMIRE THAT! DEEPLY, DEEPLY IMPRESSIVE. YOU'VE GOT TO GO GET LOST AT  SEA, IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES  NOW. IT'S SKADZ OF THESE GREAT  STORIES. JOHN RONSON, INVESTIGATIVE  SATIRE. (CHEERS AND AP
