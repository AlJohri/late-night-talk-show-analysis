AUGUST 2, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. JASON BATEMAN IS HERE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT MOVIE HE IS PROMOTING BECAUSE AS FAR AS I'M  CONCERNED HE IS IN ALL OF THEM. [LAUGHTER] AND IN ALL OF OUR HEARTS. BIG DAY TODAY. THE SENATE PASSED AND PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED A MEASURE TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING AND CUT  TRILLIONS IN FEDERAL SPENDING. THE REPUBLIC LIVES TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY. THE ECONOMIC WOES ARE NOT OVER. IT'S BAD OWL THERE. OUR BAD IS IT IF YOU WERE INVOLVED IN A COMEDIC RESPONSE? [LAUGHTER] I'LL SHOW YOU.
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HAS ANOTHER JOB, LANDLORD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S NOT SO ODD. I WOULD HAVE GUESSED GREETER AT SOME TYPE OF RIVERBOAT CASINO OR BARTENDER AT A HAUNTED HOTEL. BUT THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES. EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO MAKE EXTRA COIN. NOT LIKE IT'S COMING OUT OF OUR POCKETS.
RECORDS SHOW BIDEN CHARGES RENT TO THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS WHO PROTECT HIM IN HIS FAMILY. THE GOVERNMENT SHELLING OUT $2200 A MONTH TO RENT A COTTAGE NEXT TO BIDEN'S MANSION IN DELAWARE.
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL --
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, $2200 A MONTH TO LIVE IN A COTTAGE IN HIS BACKYARD UNTIL DELAWARE. HOW COME HE IS A GOOD NEGOTIATOR RENT. HOW DO YOU COLLECT RENT FROM THE GUYS YOU DEPEND UPON TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. GUYS, IT'S AUGUST 1, WHERE IS THE RENT? SORRY I LEFT MY CHECKBOOK IN MY OTHER BULLET PROOF VEST. ASK ME TOMORROW WHEN I'M JOGGING ALONGSIDE YOUR CAR TO PROTECT YOU. I DON'T CARE HOW CLOGGED YOUR SINK IS, NOBODY NEEDS TO SEE THIS. [LAUGHTER] SEE WHAT THEY MEAN BY SEPARATION OF POWERS. [LAUGHTER] MOVING ON FOR A MOMENT FROM OUR DEBT CRISIS. IN RECENT WEEKS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT GREAT BRITAIN'S NEWS OF THE WORLD SCANNEDDAL. THE SORDID TALE OF A TABLOID NEWSPAPER WHOSE NEWS GATHERING METHODOLOGY CONSISTED HACKING  INTO VOICE MAILS, THE POLICE PAID OFF TO ALLOW THEM TO DO SO AND THE POLITICIANS WHO CURRIED  THEIR FAVOR. AND IF YOU EVER DO GO TO ENGLAND TRIED THE CURRIED FAVOR, -- --  [LAUGHTER] IF YOU RECALL PARLIAMENT HELD AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT EVEN DRAGGING PRIME MINISTER DAVID  CAMERON IN FRONT OF PARLIAMENT FOR A RIGHT CLOSE ROGERING SQUARE IN THE BOULDERS. WE TALKED ABOUT IT HERE.
DID THE PRIME MINISTER WANT TO BE KEPT IN THE DARK OR IS HE ANGRY WITH HIS CHIEF OF STAFF?
I'M WAITING FOR A REPLY.
HE IS NOT OBVIOUSLY SMELL A RAT WHEN HE HAS ONE IN HIS MITTS
Jon: ENGLAND IS AWESOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] WHO IS THAT YOUNG GO GETTER? WHO DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE FIVE TO EIGHT TIME ZONES BEHIND EVERYBODY ELSE RIGHT NOW? THAT'S THE SEGMENT YOU SAW IF YOU WERE WATCHING OUR SHOW IN AMERICA OR ONE OF 85 COUNTRIES  WHERE THE GLOBAL EDITION IS BROADCAST INCLUDING SUCH FREE SPEECH HAVENS AS CHAD, SOMALIA, SAUDI ARABIA, SYRIA AND GEMMEN. I'M -- YEMEN. I'M HUGE IN YEMEN. [LAUGHTER] IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY IN GREAT BRITAIN HERE IS WHAT YOU SAW OF THAT SEGMENT. ♪ ♪ YOU DIDN'T SEE IT. THEY CENSORED IT. WHY? WE WERE PRAISING THEM. ARE YOU NOT ALLOWED TO PRAISE ENGLAND IN ENGLAND? IS IT THAT A RESULT OF THE 1683 EAT IT TO FALSE -- EDICT TO FALSE MODESTY IS IT BECAUSE  PRAISE FROM AN AMERICAN MAKES YOU FEEL DIRTY. IT TURNS OUT OUR SHOW IS CENSORED IN ENGLAND BECAUSE WE AIRED FOOTAGE OF OUR PARLIAMENT  ON A COMEDY PROGRAM. THIS IS TRUE, IT'S ILLEGAL TO USE PARLIAMENTARY FOOTAGE IN A COMEDIC OR SATIRICAL CONTEXT. IF YOU WERE A RIGHT HONORABLE NEWSCASTER I COULD HAVE SHOWN THE SAME FOOTAGE COME BACK ON  CAMERA AND SO EMILY SAY, TONIGHT WE HAVE NO CONFIRMATION THAT THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT ARE BABY  EATING GOAT (bleep). [LAUGHTER] BUT WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED OR ACTUALLY ASKED FOR ANY DENIALS OF IT EITHER. THAT IS SOMETHING THE ENGLISH AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO WATCH BUT A SINCERE OFFERING  OF ADMIRATION FROM A COMEDIAN IS ILLEGAL. SEEMS CRAZY. I'VE SEEN PARLIAMENTARY FOOTAGE USED ON SATIRICAL SHOWS IN BRITAIN BEFORE.
THE RIGHT HONORABLE GENTLEMAN MAY BE AT HOME BUT HE IS THE TINY WILTED VEGETABLE --
Stephen: IF THEY CAN SHOW PARLIAMENTARY FOOTAGE IN ENGLAND  WHY CAN'T WE IN AMERICA -- WHAT IS THAT? THOSE ARE PUPPETS? [LAUGHTER] ARE YOU SURE BECAUSE I'VE SEEN BRITISH PEOPLE AND THOSE FIGURES -- THOSE LOOK ACTUALLY, THEY LOOK ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT HEALTHIER THAN MANY OF THE -- ALL RIGHT. THAT'S FINE. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WE BUMPED UP AGAINST THIS BEFORE. AS YOU KNOW WHEN WILLIAM AND KATE WERE MARRIED AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY WE WERE NOT ABLE TO USE  THAT FOR SATIRICAL PROGRAMS. BUT WITH THE -- WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW A POSITIVE REENACTMENT OF THE NUPTIALS AND CONSUMMATION  THERE AFTER. [LAUGHTER] WAS HITLER REALLY DROOLING AS AN HEIR TO THE THROWN WAS BEING VIGOROUSLY CONCEIVED? THAT'S A MATTER FOR HISTORIANS TO DECIDE. BUT THE FOOTAGE WE SHOWED TWO WEEKS AGO WAS FROM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE PEOPLES' HOUSE. I UNDERSTAND NOT BEING ALLOWED TO POKE FUN AT ENGLAND THE CENT'S LONGEST EXPERIMENT SUCH  AS ENGLISH NOBILITY. THEY ARE UNDERSTANDABLY AND PERHAPS FATALLY THIN SKINNED. HAVING HAD THEIR POWER DIMINISHED ALONG WITH THEIR ABILITY TO PRODUCE PLATELETS. BUT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS THE MOST BASIC EXPRESSION OF BRITISH DEMOCRACY! IS THAT TOO POWERFUL FOR A GOOD NATURED KICK TO THE CLOTTED CREAMS. PERHAPS IT'S THE PEOPLE YOU ARE PROTECTING, PERHAPS THE DELICATE SENSIBILITIES OF YOUR KIND  CANNOT STAND A -- MY POINT IS YOU ARE PROBABLY JUST PROTECTING THEM. BUT HERE IS THE THING, I HAVE SEEN THE (bleep) YOU SHOW ON CHANNEL 4. WHAT YOU CONSIDER APPROPRIATE PRIMETIME FAMILY FARE AVAILABLE IS NOT NON-STOP SUCK AND  (bleep) FEST OF TEENAGE SHAGGING, GAY ORGIES, LIVE AUTOPSY APBSZ THIS LADY.
HAVING OPENED UP HER HEART TO JILLAN I'M AFRAID IT'S LAURA'S  BOWELS NEXT ON THE LIST.
IF YOU SWITCH TO FRESH FRUITS, VEGETABLES, SEEDS, NUTS, SEAWEEDS YOU CAN PRODUCE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT POO, ONE THAT IS AROMATIC.
Jon: BY THE WAY THAT IS JUST YOUR PROGRAMMING. FORGIVE ME FOR LEAVING OUT ADVERTISEMENTS.
MIGHT I INTEREST YOU IN PORK SAUSAGE? I KNOW YOU ARE THINKING. YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT ALL THE THINGS YOU COULD DO WITH IT, AREN'T YOU?
Jon: YES, I'M THINKING ABOUT BEING RAPED BY MY BREAKFAST. IT'S LIKE YOU READ MY MIND. [LAUGHTER] I MEAN FOR GOD SAKES WHO IS THE ARBITER OF WHAT GETS TO GO ON THE AIR IN YOUR COUNTRY? AMERICAS POKING FUN AT PARLIAMENTARY SATIRE. I CAN'T HAVE THAT. NEW YORK CITY I WOULDN'T. -- NO I WON'T! OOOH. HELLLLOOOO, PLEASE -- ANYWAY. PARLIAMENT THING IS -- I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULDN'T AIR IT.
