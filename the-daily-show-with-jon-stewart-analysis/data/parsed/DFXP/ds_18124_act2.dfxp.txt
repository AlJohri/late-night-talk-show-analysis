WELCOME BACK. THE PRESIDENT IS IN AFRICA  AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE WHAT  BETTER PLACE TO CELEBRATE A LANDMARK GAY RIGHTS RULING. BUT HE COULDN'T ESCAPE  QUESTIONS ABOUT NSA LEAKER  EDWARD SNOWDEN.
MR. PRESIDENT, WILL YOU  USE U.S. PILL TEAR ASSETS TO  IN ANY WAY INTERCEPT MR. SNOWDEN TO AT SOME POINT  IN THE FUTURE LEAVE RUSSIA  TO TRY TO FIND SAFE PASSAGE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY?
NO, I'M TO THE GO  SCRAMBLING JETS TO GET A  29-YEAR-OLD HACKER.
AND WHY WOULD YOU? 29 IS PATHETICALLY OLD FOR A  HACKER. IT'S LIKE A 50-YEAR-OLD  QUARTERBACK. IT'S JUST SAD. NOW A 15-YEAR-OLD HACKER,  THAT WOULD BE WORTH BREAKING  OUT A DRONE OR TWO FOR. THOSE SCROFY LITTLE [BLEEP] CAN SHUT DOWN THE COUNTRY  WITH A FLIP PHONE AND A  PAPER CLIP. (APPLAUSE)
THEY'RE DANGEROUS. OKAY. SO WE'RE TO THE GOING TO  SCRAMBLE JETS TO GET HIM BUT  OUT OF INTEREST, WHERE IS SNOWDEN RIGHT NOW?
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT  VLADIMIR PUTIN CONFIRMED FOR  THE FIRST TIME THAT SNOWDEN IS IN A MOSCOW AIRPORT. AND HE SAID SNOWDEN IS STILL  IN THIS TRANSIT AREA AND  HASN'T GONE THROUGH  IMMIGRATION SO HE IS TECHNICALLY NOT IN RUSSIA.
PLEASE. TECHNICALLY NOT IN RUSSIA. HE DID -- HE'S AT THE POS  YOU COULD [BLEEP] AIRPORT. HE COULDN'T BE MORE IN  RUSSIA IF HE WAS IN A SQUARE  STANDING IN SOME NESTING  DOLLS. SO-- HE--   (APPLAUSE)  SO HE'S STUCK IN AN AIRPORT  UNABLE TO LEAVE, FORCED TO  LIVE THERE FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT 6 TIME. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS REMINDED ME OF THAT TOM  HANKS MOVIE, YOU KNOW, WHERE  HE'S TRAVELING AND THINGS END UP GOING WRONG, YES,  THAT'S IT, CASTAWAY, EXCEPT  INSTEAD OF BEING STRANDED IN AN ISLAND HE IS STRANDED IN  AN AIRPORT. NO IT'S NOT THAT ONE. THAT OTHER TOM HANKS MOVIE,  THAT'S RIGHT, WAY, EXCEPT OF  INSTEAD OF BEING STRANDED IN A LITTLE BOY'S BODY HE IS  STRANDED IN AN AIRPORT, NO,  THAT'S NOT IT EITHER. IT'S ACTUALLY, IT'S THAT  OTHER TOM HANKS MOVIE, YES,  THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT. EXCEPT INSTEAD OF HAVING  AIDS HE'S STRANDED IN AN  AIRPORT, THAT'S THE ONE. THE AIDS ONE THIS THAT IS  THE ONE I WAS THINKING OF. THAT WAS GOING TO KEEP ME UP  ALL NIGHT. NOW GOOD LUCK FINDING A  STUPID A JOKE ON TELEVISION  TONIGHT THAN THE ONE YOU  JUST HEARD. GOOD LUCK. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. GOOD LUCK. I LAY DOWN THE CHALLENGE. THAT'S A STUPID JOKE. NOW LOOK, YOU PROBABLY ARE  THINKING, OR WE CAN JUST ASK  A PUDIN TO HAND HIM OVER TO  US. WELL, FUNNY STORY. HE'S REFUSING TO. BUT ACTUALLY HE HAS A VERY  GOOD REASON.
PUTIN DISMISSED THE  IMPORTANCE OF THE ENTIRE  SNOWDEN CASE SAYING IT'S  LIKE SHEERING A PIG, LOTS OF SCREAMS BUT LITTLE WOOL. (LAUGHTER)
NORMALLY I WOULD SAY  THAT'S AN EXTREMELY STRANGE  ANALOGY BUT THERE IS  SOMETHING ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN THAT TELLS ME THAT HE  HAS SHEERED A LOT OF PIGS IN  HIS LIFETIME FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HEARING THEM  SCREAM. THE BOTTOM LINE IS-- THE  BOTTOM LINE IS, WHETHER OR  NOT WE GET OUR HANDS ON  EDWARD SNOWDEN ANY TIME SOON HAS NO BEARING ON THE FACT  THAT HE IS CURRENTLY  SCREWED. HE'S IN A FOREIGN AIRPORT,  WAITING ON A FLIGHT THAT MAY  OR MAY NOT EVEN EXIST. AS IRONIC PUNISHMENTS GO,  THAT IS ALMOST TWILIGHT ZONE  LEVEL. SO ENJOY YOUR MEALS OF  JUSTY-FREE VODKA AND  TOBLERONES, MR. SNOWDEN,  BECAUSE YOU HAVE CHECKED INTO THE RUSSIAN EQUIVALENT  OF THE HOTEL CALIFORNIA. OH, YOU CAN CHECK OUT ANY  TIME YOU LIKE, BUT YOU CAN  NEVER LEAVE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (APPLAUSE)
