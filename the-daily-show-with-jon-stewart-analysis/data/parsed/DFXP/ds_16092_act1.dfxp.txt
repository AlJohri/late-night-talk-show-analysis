FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BIG SHOW. BIG, BIG, BIG, BIG, BIG SHOW. OUR GUESTS TONIGHT, WE HAVE ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAM PAKISTAN'S FORMER PRESIDENT PERVEZ MUSHARRAF. MY GUESS IS WE'LL HAVE A DELIGHTFUL BEVERAGE AND A LOVELY CONVERSATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE ON GOING "NEWS OF THE WORLD"  PHONE HACKING SCANDAL. TO GET YOU CAUGHT UP, A SEEMINGLY SIMPLE STORY. MA AND PA OWNED NEWSPAPER HACKING INTO A MURDERED LITTLE GIRL'S PHONE AND... (LAUGHTER). ... PAYING THE POLICE TO COVER IT UP. HAS UNFORTUNATELY TURNED UGLY. (LAUGHTER) AS OF NOW, LONDON'S TWO TOP POLICEMEN AT SCOTLAND YARD LET'S  CALL THEM OFFICER BLU ROTTON HAS RESIGNED. ANDREW COLTON HAS BEEN ARRESTED AND SUNDAY TRAGICALLY AUTHORITIES ARRESTED POOR MRS. WEASLEY. (LAUGHTER) WAIT, NO THAT'S NOT MRS. WEASLEY. SORRY, TRAGICALLY, AUTHORITIES ARRESTED THE GUY FROM SIMPLY RED. YEAH, THAT'S IT. ACTUALLY, ARRESTED WAS REBEKAH BROOKS, THE WOMAN WHO RAN "NEWS  OF THE WORLD" DURING THE WORST OF-- AS THE BRITISH CALL THEM-- THE TROUBLES. (LAUGHTER) BROOKS HAD ALREADY RESIGNED HER POST FRIDAY, OSTENSIBLY TO SPEND  MORE TIME WITH HER RABBIT HAIR DRESSER. (LAUGHTER) THAT WAS A DEEP CUT. I APPRECIATE THAT THAT WAS A DEEP CUT. HONESTLY, IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THIS STORY... (LAUGHTER). ALL RIGHT. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THIS STORY GETTING MORE OUT OF CONTROL.
BREAKING NEWS.
ON THE BRITISH HACKING SCANDAL, JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, POLICE SAY SEAN HOARE-- THAT'S THE REPORTER WHO FIRST ALLEGED WIDESPREAD HACKING AT THE NOW  ENDED NEWS OF NATION-- HE'S BEEN FOUND DEAD IN HIS HOME. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: DO YOU THINK HE DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES OR WAS IT MURDOCH? (OMINOUS MUSIC). (APPLAUSE) WELL, I'M SURE SCOTLAND YARD'S ON THIS CASE LIKE CREAM ON A...
RIGHT NOW POLICE SAY THE DEATH IS NOT CONSIDERED SUSPICIOUS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, I GUESS THE GUYS WHO WERE BRIBED DON'T THINK  THERE'S ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS IN THE DEATH OF THE GUY WHO BLEW THE WHISTLE ON THE COMPANY  PROVIDING THE BRIBES, I'M SATISFIED. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS PRELUDE TO TODAY'S MAIN EVENT. RUPERT MURDOCH AND HIS SON JAMES APPEARING BEFORE PARLIAMENT'S COMMITTEE ON CULTURE, MEDIA, SPORT, AND VOWEL-SHAPED FURNITURE. (LAUGHTER) CONFESS BEFORE THE U-SHAPED DESK OF CONTRITION! DON'T MAKE US BRING IN THE E! (LAUGHTER) THE WHOLE DAY OF TESTIMONY WAS AMAZING BUT PERHAPS NO MOMENT  MORE REMARKABLE THAN MURDOCH INTERRUPTING HIS SON'S OPENING STATEMENT.
OF THE "NEWS OF THE WORLD" NEWSPAPER...
BEFORE YOU GET TO THAT, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY ONE SENTENCE. THIS IS THE MOST HUMBLE DAY OF MY LIFE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: NOT SO HUMBLE YOU COULDN'T WAIT FOR YOUR TURN TO TALK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, THAT WAS BEFORE SOME IDIOT TRIED TO PIE MURDOCH. THE YOUNG WOMAN IN PINK, WHOSE LIGHTNING REFLEX AND DEVASTATING... HER LIGHTNING  REFLEX AND DEVASTATING CHUCK NORRIS-ESQUE HAND SPEED SUBDUED THE MISCREANT. THAT WOMAN IS, IN FACT, RUPERT MURDOCH'S WIFE WENDY. NOW, I AM NOT A BIG PROPONENT OF THE FOUR DECADE MARRIAGE AGE GAP. BUT... (LAUGHTER). ... IF EVER THERE WAS A SITUATION WHERE IT WOULD PAY DIVIDENDS... (LAUGHTER). ... IT WOULD BE AN AMBUSH LIKE THAT. OF COURSE, THE ATTACK OCCURRED AFTER A PERIOD OF THE TESTIMONY WHERE MURDOCH MAY HAVE APPEARED  SOMEWHAT VULNERABLE. (LAUGHTER) WHAT OF IT? CRIKEY, IS IT OVER? DO WE OWN PARLIAMENT YET? (LAUGHTER) ALL IN ALL, IT'S A STORY TAILOR MADE FOR THE 24 HOUR NEWS CULTURE. BIG PERSONALITY, SCANDAL, BRIBERY, HACKING, CELEBRITY, DEATH. BUT ONE NETWORK HAS BEEN RETICENT TO DUMPSTER DIVE INTO ANY ASPECT OF THE STORY OTHER  THAN THEIR HERE IS DISAPPOINTMENT AT SOME OF THEIR COMPETITOR'S BEHAVIOR.
WE HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. WE ARE TEETERING ON DEFAULT AND WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY TALK ABOUT THIS.
VIRTUALLY EVERY TABLOID IS GUILTY OF SOME KIND OF OFFENSE.
WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE PILING ON? WE KNOW IT'S A HACKING SCANDAL. SHOULDN'T WE GET BEYOND IT?
THE LEFT HAS BEEN OUT TO GET NEWSCORP, ESPECIALLY FOX NEWS CHANNEL AND THE MURDOCH FAMILY  FOR YEARS.
MURDOCH, WHO OWNS IT, HAS APOLOGIZED BUT FOR SOME REASON THE PUBLIC, THE MEDIA, KEEPS  GOING OVER THIS AGAIN AND AND AGAIN.
THE PILING ON. S.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST CASE OF PILING ON SINCE THE LAST RUGBY GAME I SAW. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: RUGBY, BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE GOING TO KISS RUPERT  MURDOCH'S ASS WITH A REFERENCE, AT LEAST CALL IT AUSSIE RULES FOOTBALL. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THE BIGGEST CASE OF  PILING ON SINCE COMMON READ A POEM AT THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MAYBE YOUR COMPETITORS ARE TAKING AN UNSEEMLY AMOUNT OF PLEASURE. BUT PERHAPS THEY DON'T HAVE FOX'S FINELY TUNED SENSE OF PRO PROPORTIONALITY. THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPOT STORIES OF REAL CRIMINALITY  AND IMPORT, LIKE THE CRIMES OF, LET'S SAY, NPR.
THE NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO EXECUTIVE CAUGHT ON TAPE IN A BIGOTED HATE-FILLED RANT.
JUAN WILLIAMS FIRED BY NPR FOR SAYING HE GETS NERVOUS WHEN FLYING WITH MUSLIMS.
THE UPHEAVAL AT NPR REACHED ITS ZENITH TODAY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA STILL SUPPORTS GIVING NPR YOUR TAX DOLLAR MONEY.
ON THE NPR SCANDAL, IS THE LEFT WING MEDIA PLAYING THAT DOWN?
LIBERALS ARE INTOLERANT.
WE'VE LINKED NPR TO SOROS, WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING OVER THERE.
THE CORRUPTION IS SO WIDESPREAD IT'S SUCCEEDED IN PERMEATING EVERY AREA OF THE  MAINSTREAM MEDIA.
THESE CRACKPOTS AT NPR.
THE TOTALITARIAN TACTICS OF THE LEFT.
IS NPR AN AGENT SOMEHOW OF A JIHADIST INQUISITION. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: IS NPR AN AGENT SOMEHOW OF A JIHADIST INQUISITION? I'M GOING SAY YES BECAUSE WHY ELSE WOULD YOU BRING IT UP? (LAUGHTER) SEE, THAT IS A REASONABLY PROPORTIONED RESPONSE. THIS IS OVERREACTION TO THE MURDOCH CASE WHICH WHAT IS AT MOST AN EPIC BRIBERY AND  INFLUENCE PEDDLING SCANDAL CONSUMING BRITAIN'S POLITICAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JOURNALISTIC  ESTABLISHMENT IS REALLY A WASTE OF EVERYONE'S TIME. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, I KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM, IS YOU'RE JEALOUS. AS A NEWSCORP PROPERTY, YOU'RE NOT UPSET THAT YOUR STANDARDS HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED BY YOUR  SCANDAL BONER ETHIC. YOU'RE UPSET THEY GET TO HAVE THE FUN WHILE YOU GET TO SIT ON YOUR HANDS. THIS SCANDAL WAS MADE FOR YOU GUYS! FOR GOD'S SAKE, LOOK AT THESE, D.S.K., MADE MEN, THAT'S A GREAT ONE. OBAMA BEATS WEINER. OSAMA BIN LADEN BIN WEST BANKING. THESE ARE PRICELESS PUNS. IMAGINE THE FRUSTRATION THAT THE PUN MASTERS OVER THERE MUST BE FEELING. THEY'RE MISSING OUT ON THE CHANCE TO SHAME A HIGH PROFILE MEDIA MOGUL, MAKE THAT NASTY  INSINUATIONS ABOUT HIS SECOND IN COMMAND. INDULGE IN PUNS ABOUT HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE. AND THE DEATH OF A WHISTLE-BLOWER? RIGHT! I MEAN, IT'S EASY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S SO EASY! POOR BASTARDS! NOW, I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU DON'T HAVE THE BALLS TO CONFRONT  MURDOCH ON THIS, I'VE SEEN YOU DO IT. WHEN THIS SCANDAL BROKE IN 2009, FOX'S STEVE BARNEY YANKED MURDOCH'S ASS OUT OF SUN VALLEY AND LAID THE SMACK DOWN.
THE STORY THAT IS REALLY BUZZING ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY AND CERTAINLY HERE IN NEW YORK  IS THAT THE "NEWS OF THE WORLD," A NEWS CORPORATION NEWSPAPER IN BRITAIN...
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT ISSUE AT ALL TODAY. SORRY.
I CAN, NO WORRIES MR. CHAIRMAN, THAT'S FINE WITH ME. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: AND STAY DOWN! WE'LL BE
