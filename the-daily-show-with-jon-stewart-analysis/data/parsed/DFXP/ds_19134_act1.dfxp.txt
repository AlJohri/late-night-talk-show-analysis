FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. VERY GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, ONE OF OUR FAVORITES THERE, MR. FAREED ZAKARIA. FAREED ZAKARIA WILL BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT. PEOPLE ARE HOOTING BECAUSE APPARENTLY TONIGHT AT "THE DAILY SHOW" IT'S CHUCK E. CHEESE NIGHT. EVERYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE, IT'S THEIR BIRTHDAY, THE ENTIRE, ENTIRE AUDIENCE. BUT FIRST, WE'VE THROWN CERTAIN PUBLIC FIGURES A FAIR AMOUNT OF SHADE FOR ONE PARTICULAR UNSEEMLY DINING HABIT, THE PIZZA WITH A FORK. IT'S, IT'S THE GREATEST SIN A NEW YORKER CAN COMMIT NEXT TO, OBVIOUSLY, DOING CARNAL THINGS WITH AN ONION BAGEL. LOOK, MY POINT IS THIS, IT TURNS OUT WE GOT OURSELVES A REPEAT OFFENDER.
BILL DE BLASIO AND HIS FAMILY ARRIVED IN NAPLES TODAY.
HE WAS AGAIN CAUGHT USING A FORK AND KNIFE WHILE DINING WITH HIS FAMILY AT A PIZZERIA IN NAPLES. THE MAYOR SAYS IT'S IN KEEPING WITH PEOPLE AND HOW THEY EAT THEIR SLICES THERE.
Jon: OH, YEAH, BLAME IT ON THE LOCALS. SURE, YEAH, CLASSIC. ALTHOUGH I DO GUESS IF HE JUST DID PICK UP HIS PIZZA SLICE AND EAT IT WITH HIS HANDS, I BET THE ITALIAN "DAILY SHOW" WOULD HAVE HAD A FIELD DAY ON HIM. [LAUGHTER] WOW, THAT GUY REALLY MUGS FOR THE CAMERA. WRITE SOME JOKES. HERE'S MY FAVORITE PART OF THIS.  KEEP YOUR EYE ON DE BLASIO'S DAUGHTER CHIARA. SHE'S ANTICIPATING THE REACTION BACK IN THE STATES WITH AN INTERNATIONAL GESTURE. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S AN INTERNATIONAL GESTURE THAT CAN ONLY BE CALLED, "YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN [BLEEPED] LUNCH." YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE EATING PIZZA WITH A KNIFE AND FORK ISN'T SO NEW YORK, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S PURE NEW YORK, THE ESSENCE OF THIS GREAT CITY? FINDING A NEW NON-VERBAL WAY OF TELLING SOMEONE TO [BLEEPED] OFF. WE MISS YOU GUYS. SPEAKING OF OUR FAIR CITY AND STATE, NEW YORK HAS HAD ITS FAIR SHARE OF ALBANY-BASED CORRUPTION IN RECENT YEARS, WHETHER IT BE NEW YORK STATE SENATOR MALCOLM SMITH TRYING TO BUY HIS WAY ON TO THE MAYORAL BALLOT LAST YEAR, STATE SENATOR JOHN SAMPSON'S $440,000 EMBEZZLEMENT CASE OR PERHAPS YOU'D PREFER SOMETHING MORE COMPLEX, MORE SOPHISTICATED. STATE ASSEMBLYMAN ERIC STEVENSON CAUGHT ACCEPTING BRIBES IN EXCHANGE FOR LEGISLATION ON A WIRE STING CONDUCTED BY ANOTHER ASSEMBLYMAN MR. CASTRO, COOPERATING, MOST LIKELY AFTER BEING INDICTED HIMSELF ON PERJURY CHARGES. YES, ALBANY IS A VERITABLE [BLEEPED] MAN'S SAMPLER OF CORRUPTION. OH, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? OH, THIS ONE, OH, YEAH, THIS TASTES LIKE STATE SENATOR MONSERRATE'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES. MMM, WITH A FEDERAL MAIL FRAUD GANACHE AND JUST A HINT, A HINT OF CONSPIRACY CHARGES NOUGAT. MMM, MMM. BUT A FEW YEARS BACK THERE EMERGE A MAN PROMISING TO CHANGE ALL THAT. [LAUGHTER] I HAD TO PICK THE ONE WITH THE CARAMEL. I HAD TO PICK THE CARAMEL. HAD TO PICK THE ONE THAT DOESN'T DIGEST FOR LIKE AN HOUR AND A HALF. THERE WE GO. THERE EMERGED A MAN TO FIGHT THIS, A CORRUPTION BATTLING ATTORNEY GENERAL. NO, NOT THAT ONE. NOT THE ONE WHO HAD TO RESIGN IN HIS OWN PERSONAL CORRUPTION SCANDAL. THAT'S THE ONE. ANDREW CUOMO, A CORRUPTION FIGHTING FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO CAMPAIGNED FOR GOVERNOR ON ONE OFT-REPEATED PLEDGE.
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE CLEAN UP ALBANY.
CLEAN UP ALBANY. WE'RE GOING TO START WITH CLEANING UP ALBANY. WE NEED TO CLEAN UP ALBANY NOW.
Jon: AND WHILE I HAVE YOU, HAVE YOU BEEN INJURED IN CAR ACCIDENT? [LAUGHTER] HAVE YOU BEEN EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS? I CAN HELP ALL THREE THINGS. ANYWAY, CUOMO WAS ELECTED AND THEN TRIED TO ENACT SOMETHING CALLED "THE PUBLIC TRUST ACT." WHICH WOULD ENHANCE PROSECUTORS' ABILITIES TO CRACK DOWN ON PUBLIC CORRUPTION. THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS, IT TURNS OUT LEGISLATIVE BODIES THAT ARE FETID SWAMPS OF CORRUPTION ARE GENERALLY LOATHE TO PASS DREDGING LEGISLATION. WE ALL REMEMBER SENATOR PIGPEN'S VERY FAMOUS FILIBUSTER OF THE 1952 BATH ACT. [LAUGHTER] WELL, GUESS WHAT? GOVERNOR CUOMO DOESN'T TAKE NO-MO. FOR... FOR, AH [BLEEPED] IT, HE TRIED SOMETHING ELSE.
IN RESPONSE, THE GOVERNOR CREATED WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE MOORELAND COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CORRUPTION WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE.
Jon: OH, SO CORRUPTION IS NOT ENOUGH OF A PROBLEM TO PASS LEGISLATION. WELL, THEN I GUESS YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF MY COMMISSION LOOKED UNDER HERE. WHAT'S UNDER HERE? AND LO AND BEHOLD, JUST NINE MONTHS LATER...
LAST MONTH THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE ETHICS BILL AS PART OF THE STATE BUDGET. AND CUOMO MADE THE DECISION TO DISBAND HIS COMMISSION.
Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT, FOLKS. COMMISSION ACCOMPLISHED. AS ANDREW CUOMO CAMPAIGNS FOR HIS REELECTION, HE CAN BE SECURE KNOWING THAT HIS TENACITY HELPED CLEAN UP GOTHAM CITY. A REFORMER WHO ROSE ABOVE POLITICS AS USUAL CORRUPTION BECAUSE OF GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE HULK SMASH.
REPORTS IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" CLAIM THAT AFTER APPOINTING THE COMMISSION, THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE INTERFERED WITH ITS WORK, "OBJECTING WHENEVER THE COMMISSION FOCUSED ON GROUPS WITH TIES TO MR. CUOMO."
THE GOVERNOR CREATED A PANEL TO TACKLE CORRUPTION THEN SYSTEMATICALLY BLOCKED IT FROM PROBING ANYTHING RELATED TO HIMSELF. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SAY IT AIN'T SO, ANDY. SAY IT AIN'T SO. WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE HE EVER SAID THE COMMISSION COULD INVESTIGATE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.
THE COMMISSION CLEARLY HAS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO LOOK AT ANYTHING THEY WANT TO LOOK AT, INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE CONTROLLER, ET CETERA. THEY HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY.
Jon: BASICALLY CUOMO FORMED A COMMISSION PROMISING YOU CAN EVEN LOOK AT ME, AND THEN WHEN THEY LOOKED AT HIM, HE SAID, YOU LOOKIN' AT ME? YOU LOOKIN' AT ME? I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER GOVERNORS HERE. YOU LOOKIN' AT ME? YOU LOOKIN' AT ME? SO, GOVERNOR CUOMO?
GOVERNOR CUOMO'S OFFICE GAVE THE TIMES A 13-PAGE STATEMENT. "A COMMISSION APPOINTED BY AND STAFFED BY THE EXECUTIVE CANNOT INVESTIGATE THE EXECUTIVE."
ARGUING THAT SINCE HE CREATED IT AND THAT SINCE THE COMMISSION REPORTED TO HIM, HE COULD NOT BE ACCUSED OF INTERFERENCE.
Jon: YOU KNOW THAT [BLEEPED] RIDICULOUS, RIGHT? [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW THE "I MADE IT I CAN DO WHAT I WANT WITH IT EXCUSE" ONLY WORKS FOR GEORGE LUCAS. YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT? I DON'T CARE HOW INCONGRESS IT IS THAT THIS SPACE WESTERN NOW INCLUDES A REGGAE RABBIT LIVING UNDER THE SEA. HE STAYS IN THE PICTURE. HE STAYS! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOW WHY COULDN'T...
REGGAE RABBIT. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, GEORGE. TURNS OUT GOVERNOR CUOMO MAY BE LIKE THE BOSS WHO SAYS, YEAH NO, WE'LL PLAY HOOPS AT LUNCH. YOU CAN GO HARD. WHEN JIMMY FROM ACCOUNTING BLOCKS HIS SHOT AS HE DRIVES THE LANE, HE GOES, HEY, THE OTHER TEAM'S NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH THE BALL BECAUSE I STARTED THE GAME. LOOK, I REALLY HOPE THERE'S NOTHING TO THIS BECAUSE NEW YORK'S GOVERNORS HAVE TWO HALLS, SHAME AND FAME. AND ONE OF THEM IS VERY CROWDED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
