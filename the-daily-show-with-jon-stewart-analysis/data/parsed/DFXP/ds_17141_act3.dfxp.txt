CHAZZ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE ANCHOR AND MANAGING  EDITOR OF "NBC NIGHTLY NEWS," WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM BRIAN WILLIAMS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY'RE JUST JUST HAPPY YOU'RE SAFE. HOW ARE YOU?
A LOT OF EXCITEMENT. CAMERA CREWS BACKSTAGE. WE'RE DOING A LITTLE THING, DO YOU KNOW?
Jon: BRIAN'S SHOW WITH THE ROCK CENTER" IS DOING A STORY ON OUR PROGRAM. WELL, NOT AT ALL... NOT JUST ABOUT OUR PROGRAM.
NOT AT ALL ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WE ARE DOING A STORY ABOUT THE JOY OF HAVING DOGS IN THE WORKPLACE.
Jon: WE HAVE DOGS.
BETWEEN PARKER AND CALLY. CALLY IS MY... >>.
Jon: SOUL MATE?
SOUL MATE. A FURRY LOVE BUCKET WHICH...
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITHQUALLY CREEPS EVERYONE OUT. (LAUGHTER)
I GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR WITH QUALLY AS YOU SEE.
Jon: I KNOW.
I LOVE ME SOME QUALLY. HE'S SLEEPING NOW.
Jon: YEAH.
AFTER WHAT JUST HAPPENED.
Jon: I'M SURE. THAT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH ONE. WE'RE GOING TO... THE NIGHTMARES WHEN SHE SLEEPS NOW SHE JUST DOES THIS "BRIAN, NO! NO! BRIAN, NO!"
Jon: BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY TWO DOGS. THERE ARE MYRIAD DOGS HERE, MAYBE EIGHT. BAN BOO, ALI GREENBERG WHO'S A LOVELY DALMATION.
I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTERN.
Jon: YOU NEVER MET ALI GREENBERG.
I THINK SHE WAS ON THE GYMNASTICS TEAM THIS LAST....
Jon: YOU WENT TO THE OLYMPICS FOR TWO WEEKS. WE HAD MISTY MAY-TREANOR ON. WHAT DID YOU WIN?
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I COMPETED, LOMB GOT THE BRONZE IN THE VAULT. (LAUGHTER)
YOU DESERVE A MEDAL FOR THE CONTORTIONS YOU WENT THROUGH NOT GIVING AWAY THE RESULTS.
YEAH, I KNOW.
Jon: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO SHUT YOUR EYES. I'M GOING TO SKU ASK YOU TO LEAVE YOUR ROOM. WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT UP ON THE SCREEN. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO PUT A BAG ON YOUR HEAD.
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I CAN FEEL YOU WATCHING AND WHEN I'M  WRITING THAT STUFF I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE.
Jon: YOU DON'T WRITE ANY OF THAT STUFF. THEY TAKE YOU OUT OF A VEGETABLE CRISPER FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE SHOW. (LAUGHTER) AND THEY PUT YOU IN FRONT OF SOMETHING SPELLED OUT PHONETICALLY. I KNOW HOW THIS GOES. I'M IN THE BUSINESS.
18 DAYS. MY WIFE AND I-- NOT TO BRAG-- AT THE MARRIOTT IN LONDON. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU HAD CABLE!
IF MISTY MAY CAN DO IT, I CAN DO IT.
Jon: LET'S TALK ABOUT PAUL RYAN. ALL I HAVE HEARD FROM THE NEWS DIVISIONS ACROSS NETWORK PLATFORMS IS HOW THRILLED THEY  ARE TO HAVE PAUL RYAN NOW THEY CAN FINALLY TALK SUBSTANCE. WHEN IS THAT GOING TO START HAPPENING? (LAUGHTER)
AS SOON AS WE EXHAUST ALL OF OUR REPORTING ON HIS DRIVING OF  THE WEINER MOBILE WHILE A YOUNG MAN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I KNOW. FINALLY WE'RE GOING TO GET TO TALK ABOUT SERIOUS STUFF. DID YOU KNOW HE WORKS OUT ON THE P.X.-90?
I DON'T KNOW THIS WORKOUT PROGRAM.
Jon: THE P.X.--90 PROGRAM?
DRUDGE RECKLESSLY REPORTED YESTERDAY HE HAS BODY FAT BETWEEN 6% AND 8%.
Jon: OH, TO BE A PAIR OF CALIPERS. (LAUGHTER) WHY... WHY CAN'T THEY? WHAT IS PREVENTING THE MEDIA FROM DISCUSSING MORE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION  OF PAUL RYAN AND THEN SINCE THE INTRODUCTION AND THEN, LET'S SAY YOU KNOW, AFTER THE ELECTION. (LAUGHTER) IS THERE AN DISABILITY FROM ABOVE OR LACK OF INTEREST?
THERE ARE A LOT OF DISTRACTIONS, AS YOU KNOW.
Jon: NO, I DON'T. (LAUGHS)
AND I THINK AS THE GREAT SY SIMS, THE CLOTHEIER HERE IN NEW  YORK HAD MY FAVORITE EXPRESSION. RADIO COMMERCIALS. HE SAID "AN EDUCATED CONSUMER IS OUR BEST CUSTOMER." AND I THOUGHT GOOD ON THE LATE  SY SIMS BECAUSE HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT BEING A HABERDASHER BUT HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT OUR BUSINESS. I SAY "OUR" MEANING MINE AND NOT YOURS. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: LET ME REFRAME THE QUESTION. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO START MAKING NICE SUITS. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S ALL OUT THERE... I HAVE NEVER WANTED YOU AS MUCH AS I DO RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) IT'S ALL THAT COVERAGE IS OUT THERE AND WE'VE BEEN COVERING  SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES THIS WHOLE TIME AND WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE GET A BITE OUT OF HIS VOTING RECORD AS  WE VOTED ON LAST NIGHT. WAIT UNTIL MORE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE VOTE ON TARP. WAIT UNTIL WE GET DOWN THE ROAD. THIS WAS TODAY SPECIFICALLY AS I SAID TONIGHT WAS A TERRIBLE DAY FOR DISCOURSE IN A DEMOCRACY  WITH 84 DAYS LEFT TO GO UNTIL THE ELECTION YOU HAD BIDEN'S COMMENT. GIULIANI COMES OUT TODAY AND SAYS BIDEN ISN'T SMART ENOUGH TO BE PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE ROMNEY UPSET BECAUSE OF BIDEN LAST NIGHT AND YOU HAD TEAM OBAMA HITTING BACK AS ROMNEY. WE CAN'T AS A COUNTRY KEEP DOING THIS.
Jon: THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TO FIX PROBLEMS IS BROKEN.
ABSOLUTELY BROKEN.
Jon: THE SYSTEM ITSELF IS UTTERLY DYSFUNCTIONAL AND BROKEN.
THAT'S WHY THE "NEW YORK TIMES" OP-ED PAGE POINTED OUT A  WEEK AGO SAID YOU'RE SEE NOTHING GRAND SPEECHES BECAUSE BOTH SIDES ARE SO HARDENED, EVERYONE  HOOZ RETREATED TO THEIR CORNERS, THERE'S NO CHANGING MIND. THERE IS NO GOOD, DECENT DISCOURSE GOING ON. HOPEFULLY THE DEBATES PEOPLE WILL GET A BETTER IDEA OF....
Jon: THIS SEEMS TO BE AN ELECTION THAT IS BASED ON TRYING AS BEST YOU CAN TO SUPPRESS THE  VOTER TURNOUT OF YOUR OPPONENT. WHETHER IT BE THROUGH DEMEANING THEM OR IN THE CASE OF MANY OF THE REPUBLICAN STATES JUST  CLOSING VOTING BOOTHS IN BLACK DISTRICTS. (LAUGHTER)
WELL WHEN YOU TALK TO OUR POLITICAL GUYS ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IT JUST  SAY LOOK THIS IS ABOUT 12 COUNTIES IN THE UNITED STATES. FORGET SWING STATES. FORGET REGIONS. IT'S... IT COMES DOWN 12 COUNTIES IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS SO MUCH. IT'S A SCIENCE TO THEM. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE REALLY LOOKING TO CAST A VOTE FOR SOMEONE THEY  THINK IS GOING TO FIX THINGS THE BEST AND BE GOOD TO US ALONG THE WAY.
Jon: OKAY. SO WHO'S THAT?
I WISH I KNEW. YOU KNOW I DON'T DO THAT KIND OF THING, JON.
Jon: I'VE SBHEN YOU. DO I'VE SEEN THE KIND OF THINGS YOU DO. (LAUGHTER) STAY AWAY FROM THAT DOG. (LAUGHTER) BRIAN WILLIAMS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
