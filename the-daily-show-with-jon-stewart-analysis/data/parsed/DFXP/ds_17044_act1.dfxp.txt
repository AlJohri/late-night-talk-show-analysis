JANUARY 16, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AUTHOR JODI KANTOR. SHE'S AUTHOR OF "THE OBAMAS" WHICH IS ABOUT THE OBAMAS. WE DO HAVE A BIG SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY I'M WEARING A BEJEWELED CROWN. LONG STORY SHORT. I CAME INTO A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. ( APPLAUSE ) ON THURSDAY....
COLBERT HAS JUST ANNOUNCED HE WILL EXPLORE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AND STEWART WILL OVERSEE HIS POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY, MONEY, MONEY. EXCEPT IT REALLY IS. I'M NOW RUNNING COLBERT'S SUPER PAC AND THE VAST FORTUNE  THAT THAT ENTAILS BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY, AND STEPHEN COLBERT BY LAW CANNOT COORDINATE WITH ME.
I CAN'T TELL AMERICANS FOR A BETTER TOMORROW TOMORROW WHAT TO DO. IT'S NOT MY SUPER PAC, GEORGE. IT'S THE SUPER PAC OF-- I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THIS CORRECTLY-- JON STEW-AIR. I BELIEVE IT'S A SOFT-T.
Jon: FUNNY JOKEMENT IT'S SULLY SEW-AIR. BOTH Ts ARE SILENT. BECAUSE OF THE STRICT SEPARATION OF SUPER PAC AND CANDIDATE AND THE FACT THAT I  DON'T SPEAK TO STEPHEN COLBERT EXCEPT BY PHONE OR IN PERSON, I'M JUST OUT HERE LIKE A CARTOON HOBO WHO WON THE LOTERY. DO I USE ALL THIS MONEY THAT INDIVIDUALS AND/OR CORPORATIONS WHO BELIEVE  DEEPLY IN STEPHEN COLBERT HAVE DONATED TO CREATE AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN AROUND  COLBERT'S STRENGTHS OR DO I BUY THIS (LAUGHING) FROM THE ESTATE OF ELIZABETH TAYLOR? BOTH ARE LEGAL. BOTH ARE LEGAL. BUT ONLY ONE BRINGS OUT MY EYES. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HAPPENS TO LEAVE ME WITH  ENOUGH LEFT OVER TO PAY THE COUNTRY OF CHINA SO FROM SPACE YOU CAN READ 58008. WHICH UNBE KNOWN TO THE CHINESE WHEN THE PLANET ROTATES SAYS THIS. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING  THERE'S NO WAY STEVEN COLBERT WANTED JON STEWART TO BLOW ALL HIS SUPER PAC MONEY ON THIS  KIND OF CRAP. MAYBE. WHO CAN TELL? WATCH NEWT GINGRICH TRY DESPERATELY TO SEND A MESSAGE TO HIS SUPER PAC ABOUT WHAT HE  WOULD LIKE THEM TO DO WITH THE 30-MINUTE ANTI-MITT ROMNEY MOVIE THEY HAD ALREADY PAID  FOR AND DISTRIBUTED.
I'M CALLING ON THE SUPER PAC... I CANNOT COORDINATE WITH THEM OR COMMUNICATE  DIRECTLY BUT I CAN SPEAK OUT AS A CITIZEN TALKING TO YOU. I'M CALLING ON THEM TO EITHER EDIT OUT EVERY SINGLE MISTAKE OR TO PULL THE ENTIRE FILM. BUT TO NOT RUN THE FILM IF IT WAS ERRORS IN IT.
Jon: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? GOOD LUCK UNTANGLING THOSE VERBAL HIEROGLYPHICS. IT'S LIKE A MYSTERY INSIDE AN ENIGMA WRAPPED IN A GROWN MAN'S HEAD INSIDE A BABY'S BODY. I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO WATCH STEVEN COLBERT WHEN HE'S PUBLICLY SPEAKING ON  TELEVISION AND LOOK FOR CLUES AS TO WHAT HE WANTS ME TO DO.
DID QUEEN ISABELLE A SAY GO TO AMERICA AND THEN SAY HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING, LIKE I  HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN ON THE NINA AND THE PINTA AND THE SANTA MARIA YET. LET ME GO AND COME BACK AND FIND THE SPICE ROUTE AND THEN COME BACK, PLEASE.
Jon: QUEEN ISABEL A, COLUMBUS. ITALIAN SPICE. I GET YOU. YOU'RE SAYING TO ME THROUGH THE TELEVISION THE HEAD OF YOUR SUPER PAC YOU WANT ME TO  PAY MARIO BATTALI AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SUPER PAC MONEY TO MAKE ME A DELICIOUS MEAL SO  THAT MAY BE SUSTAINED FOR THIS VOYAGE? CHEF! CHEF! (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THANK YOU. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
HERE YOU ARE MR. STEWART.
Jon: FRITTAT CON EGGS. THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. IT LOOKS DELICIOUS. BUT THERE IS MUCH MORE ME TO SAY YET TONIGHT. I NEED TO PRESERVE MY JAW STRENGTH. AS YOU KNOW, MY SALIVA IS CONSIDERED CURRENCY IN SOUTH AMERICA.
IT IS GOING TO COST YOU DOUBLE, SIR.
Jon: RIDICULOUS. AN ALMOST CRIM CRIMINAL WAY OF THE PEOPLE'S SUPER PAC MONEY. I'LL DO IT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  AND THAT IS HOW JON STEWART  GOT MENINGITIS. STEPHEN, I AWAIT FURTHER NON-INSTRUCTIONAL PUBLIC STATEMENTS. THROUGH THE TELEVISION. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS.
