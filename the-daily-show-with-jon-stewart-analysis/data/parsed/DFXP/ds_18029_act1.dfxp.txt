Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART! WE'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT,  MAN. WE'RE NOT MESSING AROUND. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, NOTED --  (AUDIENCE YELLS SOMETHING)  I'M SORRY? I HOPE THAT WAS NOT AN  ANTI-SEMITIC SLUR. OUR GUEST TONIGHT -- (LAUGHS)  IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TODAY SO --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR THE KIND WISHES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU FOR THE KIND BIRTHDAY  WISHES, AGAIN, THANK YOU. VERY KIND. BUT LET'S GET TO OUR SHOW! THE NOTED AUTHOR AND INVENTOR  NEIL YOUNG IS GOING TO BE  JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE  ATTACKS ON THE U.S. CONSULATE IN BENGHAZI, LIBYA. IT WAS A TRAGIC SITUATION WHERE  AMERICAN LIVES WERE LOST AND IN  THE THREE MONTHS SINCE THE ATTACK, LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS OF  ADEQUATE EMBASSY SECURITY,  AMERICAS OVERALL ADVOCACY IN FIGHTING THE WAR ON TERROR AND  THE INTRICATE DANCE BETWEEN  NATIONAL SECURITY  CONFIDENTIALITY AND THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW HAVE ALL BEEN  DISTILLED DOWN, THROWN OUT AND  REPLACED WITH THIS ONE URGENT CONCLUSION CONCERNING CURRENT  U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UNITED  NATIONS SUSAN RICE.
I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY  POWER TO BLACK HER FROM BEING  THE UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF  STATE. SHE'S NOT QUALIFIED.
Jon: THAT'S SENATOR JOHN  McCAIN CONTINUING HIS SEVEN  YEAR QUEST TO NEGATE EVERY GOOD THING HE'D EVER DONE PRIOR TO  THAT. (LAUGHTER)  THIS TIME LEADING THE CHARGE TO  PREEMPT AS AN OF NOW  HYPOTHETICAL OBAMA NOMINATION FOR SECRETARY OF STATE TO  REPLACE HILLARY CLINTON. WHY? BECAUSE FIVE DAYS AFTER THE  BENGHAZI ATTACKS, SUSAN RICE  WENT ON THE SUNDAY TALK SHOWS AND SAID THIS: .
THE BEST ASSESSMENT WE HAVE  TODAY IS THAT IN FACT THIS WAS  NOT A PREPLANNED, PREMEDITATED  ATTACK. THAT WHAT HAPPENED INITIALLY WAS  A SPONTANEOUS REACTION TO WHAT  HAD JUST TRANSPIRED IN CAIRO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE VIDEO.
Jon: (WHIT PERKING)  WE KNOW THAT THAT'S WRONG NOW. AND WE NOW KNOW MANY IN THE  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION KNEW  IMMEDIATELY THAT THAT STATEMENT WAS WRONG. THAT THE ATTACKERS WERE NOT  ANGRY FILM CRITICS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT AL QAEDA OR ONE OF AL  QAEDA'S ABLE A. TEAMS, THE ANSAR  AL-SHARIA MUD HENS. (LAUGHTER)  SO SUSAN RICE MET YESTERDAY WITH  SENATORS McCAIN, GRAHAM AND  AYOTTE TO CLEAR THE AIR. HOW DID THAT GO?
AMBASSADOR RICE I THINK DOES  NOT DO JUSTICE TO THE REALITY AT  THE TIME AND IN HINDSIGHT CLEARLY WAS COMPLETELY WRONG.
WE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY TROUBLED  BY MANY OF THE ANSWERS THAT WE  GOT AND SOME THAT WE DIDN'T GET CONCERNING EVIDENCE THAT WAS  OVERWHELMING LEADING UP TO THE  ATTACK ON OUR CONSULATE.
Jon: HERE'S THE DEAL: THEY  MAY BE RIGHT. THOUGH ON THE SCALE OF PUBLIC  MISSTATEMENTS, RICE'S COMMENTS  SEEM TO FALL MORE FOR THE EMBARRASSING EVIDENCE OF  INSTITUTIONAL DISORGANIZATION  END OF THE SCALE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT HERE'S THE THING: THESE TWO  DON'T GET TO BE THE ONES WHO  SELF-RIGHTEOUSLY GET ANGRY ABOUT  THIS. THEY'RE UPSET SHE MAY HAVE  PASSED BAD INTEL, WITTINGLY OR  UNWITTINGLY TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. REMEMBER THESE TWO FROM A DECADE  AGO?
SADDAM HUSSEIN CONTINUES TO  ACQUIRE, AMASS, AND IMPROVE ON  HIS ARSENAL OF WEAPONS OF MASS  DESTRUCTION. HE CONTINUES TO ACQUIRE --  ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE A NUCLEAR  WEAPON. THESE ARE ALL WELL-KNOWN FACTS.
LET'S ACT NOW TO GET RID OF A  TYRANT WHO'S ABUSED AND KILLED  HIS OWN PEOPLE, WHO'S PROCURING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,  SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO THAT  EFFECT.
Jon: I REMEMBER ALL THAT  FROM THEIR HIT BLOG (BLEEP) OLD  GUYS WHO UNNECESSARILY GET US INTO WARS SAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  OF COURSE, IT'S PROBABLY NOT A  ONE-TO-ONE COMPARISON. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S NOT FAIR. IT'S NOT A ONE-TO-ONE  COMPARISON. BECAUSE WHILE SUSAN RICE  ADMITTED TO THE ERROR WITHIN  WEEKS, THESE TWO STILL REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INVADING A  COUNTRY BASED ON INFORMATION  FROM A SOURCE NAMED "CURVEBALL" WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED PRETTY  (BLEEP)ING IDEA BY MANY AT THE  TIME. IF ONLY WE HAD A MORE DIRECT  COMPARISON TO MAKE HERE. SORT OF A ONE-TO-ONE. LIKE ANOTHER HIGH-RANKING  GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL PASSING WHAT  THEY KNEW AT THE TIME WAS MISLEADING INTELLIGENCE TO THE  AMERICAN PUBLIC ON A SUNDAY NEWS  SHOW. ALSO IN LINE TO BECOME SECRETARY  OF STATE AND WAS AFRICAN  AMERICAN AND A WOMAN AND, LET'S SAY HER NAME WAS ALSO RICE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING!
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE HAVE  BEEN SHIPMENTS GOING INTO IRAN,  FOR INSTANCE -- INTO IRAQ FOR INSTANCE OF ALUMINUM TUBES THAT  REALLY ARE ONLY SUITED TO HIGH  -- HIGH QUALITY ALUMINUM TUBES THAT ARE ONLY SUITED FOR NUCLEAR  WEAPONS PROGRAMS, CENTRIFUGE  PROGRAMS.
Jon: SHE KNEW THAT WAS BULL  (BLEEP) AT THE TIME. WHAT WOULD A JOHN McCAIN OR  LINDSEY GRAHAM SAY ABOUT A WOMAN  LIKE THAT'S QUALIFICATIONS FOR SECRETARY OF STATE?
TO ATTACK HER PERSONALLY IS  WAY OVER THE LINE BECAUSE SHE IS  OUR FACE AND VOICE TO THE WORLD AND YOU'RE NOT DOING ANY  AMERICAN ANY GOOD BY SENDING HER  OFF WITH SUCH LABELS.
BUT I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR  THAT CONDOLEEZZA RICE IS A  PERSON OF INTEGRITY. AND YES, I SEE THIS -- SOME  LINGERING BITTERNESS OVER A VERY  TOUGH CAMPAIGN. I HOPE IT DISSIPATES SOON.
Jon: OH, I'M SURE IT WILL. WHAT KIND OF CROTCHETY "GRAND  TORINOISH" OLD (BLEEP) WOULD BE  ABLE TO GET OVER A SIMPLE CAMPAIGN LOSS? IT'S UNIMAGINABLE. (LAUGHTER)  SO WHY IS JOHN McCAIN DOING  THIS? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WELL, THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK  CAUCUS REPRESENTATIVE MARCIA FUDGE-- THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HEARD  ME--  (LAUGHTER)  MARCIA. (LAUGHTER)  ACTUALLY, CONGRESSWOMAN FUDGE IS  ONE OF OUR NATION'S MOST  HARDWORKING AND I CAN ONLY ASSUME DELICIOUS CONGRESS  PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER)  SHE HAD A THEORY ABOUT  AMBASSADOR RICE.
ANY TIME SOMETHING GOES WRONG  THEY PICK ON WOMEN AND  MINORITIES.
COME ON NOW!
I HAVE A REAL ISSUE WITH  THAT. SUSAN RICE'S COMMENTS DIDN'T  SEND US TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.
UH-HUH!
WELL --
SOMEBODY ELSE'S DID. I'M PROBABLY NOT THE MOST  EDUCATED PERSON IN THIS HOUSE.
YOU'RE AN ATTORNEY.
BUT I'M CLOSE. JUST GO ON AND HATE ON. BUT LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND HATE  YOURSELF, NOT THE PEOPLE WHO DO  THIS WORK. THANK YOU. UH-HUH!
Jon:OOOH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FIRST OF ALL, WHY ISN'T EVERY  PRESS CONFERENCE LIKE THAT? (LAUGHTER)  A PRESS CONFERENCE INFUSED WITH  LIFE AND EMOTION. SHE JUST TURNED THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES INTO TYLER  PERRY'S "HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE ONLY PROBLEM IS -- THE ONLY  PROBLEM IS I THINK THEY MIGHT BE  WRONG.
UH-HUH.
YOU KNOW IT.
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT. UH-HUH.
Jon: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,  I HUMBLY DISAGREE THE CAUCUS.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, HE  HUMBLY DISAGREES WITH THE  CAUCUS, UH-HUH.
Jon: THAT'S NOT -- JOHN,  THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING. YOU JUST REPEATED WHAT I SAID.
I'M JUST REPEATING WHAT HE  SAYS, UH-HUH. I DO IT. I DO IT.
JON, CAN I HELP HERE?
Jon: JESSICA, COULD YOU  PLEASE?
I COME FROM BLACK CHURCHES. IT'S NOT ABOUT REPEATING  SOMETHING, IT'S ABOUT FEELING  SOMETHING.
YOU'VE GOT TO FEEL IT!
YOU CAN'T FORCE IT!
IT'S A CALL AND RESPONSE. YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE  YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION WHEN  REALLY YOU'RE NOT.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
HEY, I DO NOT HEAR A WORD YOU  SAID!
Jon: .
WHOA! YOU DON'T THINK I'LL GET THIS? BELIEVE ME, HAVE YOU GUYS EVER  SEEN THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT IN  BRITAIN? THAT PLACE IS THE WHITEST BLACK  CHURCH YOU'VE EVER SEEN. (APPLAUSE)
FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF  MARGARET THATCHER.
HERE!
YES!
HERE, HERE!
THERE YOU GO.
OKAY, NOW, ALL RIGHT.
Jon: I LOVE IT. NOW, LISTEN, I'M NOT SAYING THE  NOVA SCOTIA OVER AMBASSADOR RICE  DOESN'T HAVE RACE AS AN  INGREDIENT.
COME ON NOW, COME ON.
RIGHT.
Jon: BUT ONLY IN THE SAME  WAY THAT RACE AND SEXISM PLAY A  SUBTLY CORROSIVE PART IN NEARLY ALL OF OUR DISCOURSE.
PREACH!
TELL THE TRUTH.
UH-HUH.
Jon: THE CONGRESSIONAL  BLACK CAUCUS, INCLUDING THE  BEAUTIFULLY NAMED REPRESENTATIVE FUDGE --
OH, YEAH, FUDGE. FUDGE.
COME ON, KEEP IT COMING!
WHAT YOU GOT NOW? (LAUGHTER)
SO MUCH FUDGE! (LAUGHTER)
FORGET ABOUT IT!
FUDGE IT OUT.
Jon: THEY GET EXCITED ABOUT  FUDGE.
UH-HUH.
Jon: BUT, SEE, THEY'RE JUST  -- THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK  CAUCUS IS JUST TRYING TO PUT McCAIN AND GRAHAM'S INCOHERENT  ATTACK ON RICE IN A COHERENT  FRAME. THIS ISN'T RACISM OR SEXISM.
NO, IT AIN'T!
Jon: IT'S INDISKRIM THAT  THE BILE. MEANING IT DOES NOT  DISCRIMINATE.
NO, IT DON'T.
Jon: NOW, I'M PROBABLY NOT  THE MOST EDUCATED PERSON ON  COMEDY CENTRAL.
NO, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE  COLBERT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: .
YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT! YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT!
Jon: I'M PROBABLY THE  SECOND.
THAT'S THE SOUTH PARK GUYS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: PROBABLY THE THIRD, I  THINK I'M THE THIRD.
NO, THERE'S TWO OF THEM!
Jon: I'M THE FORTH.
DON'T FORGET MY BOY TOSH.
I'M THE FIFTH!
TOSH IS HELL LA SMART, Y'ALL.
Jon: MOTHER (BLEEP). I'M STARTING TO THINK THIS IS  NOT A GOOD IDEA AFTER ALL.
THAT SPUN OUT OF CONTROL REAL  QUICK, DIDN'T IT?
WITH THE QUICKNESS!
Jon: HOW DO YOU STOP HYPE  CREWS, BY ANY CHANCE?
YOU DON'T, THIS TRAIN IS  GONE. TOOT TOOT CHUGA-CHUGA.
CAN'T STOP IT.
COME ON!
I'LL KEEP IT ROLLING.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
COME ON NOW! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
