WE'RE BACK. WE'RE TALKING WITH HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI. WHAT CAN WE DO? HOW DO WE ADDRESS -- THERE MUST BE A WAY FOR GOVERNMENT TO EARN BACK THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WANT DESPERATELY TO BELIEVE AND HELP MAKE THAT ARGUMENT THAT THIS CAN BE FIXED.
WELL, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD PUT ALL OUR EGGS IN A WEB SITE.
Jon: NO, NO, NO, I'M MAKING A BROADER ARGUMENT. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE WEB SITE IT'S ABOUT THE V.A., THE WEB SITE, SOME OF THE FRAUD AND ABUSE THAT ARE IN A LOT OF THESE. THE FACT THAT THE OBAMACARE OR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT WE COULDN'T NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. LITTLE THINGS THAT ERODE THE CONFIDENCE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE SIDE OF WANTING GOVERNMENT TO HAVE A ROLE AS A BALANCING FACTOR AGAINST CORPORATE POWER BUT ARE DUBIOUS OF ITS ABILITY TO DO SO IN AN AGILE AND EFFICIENT WAY.
I COMPLETELY SUBSCRIBE WITH YOUR IMPATIENCE WITH THINGS THAT HAVEN'T WORKED. BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS THAT HAVE WORKED IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
Jon: BOOM, TALK TO ME. NOW WE'RE TALKING MY LANGUAGE.
WE GOT THE MAJORITY ONE OF THE SIX FOR SIX WAS TO MAKE SURE WE HAD THE NEGOTIATING POWER FOR THE SECRETARY ON DRUG PRICES. ONE THING YOU BROUGHT UP.
Jon: YES.
WE PASSED FIVE 406 WE COULDN'T PASS THE 6th 406. IT WAS TOO MUCH. WE'VE MADE PROGRESS ON IT. THE PRESIDENT HAS SOME OF THAT IN THE BUDGET TO HAVE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES PAY MORE. I SHARE THAT FRUSTRATION BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF THE PRIMARY THINGS. WE PASSED IT IN THE HOUSE BUT NOT IN THE SENATE.
Jon: WHAT WOULD YOU HOLD UP AS A PRISTINE EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, WHAT WOULD YOU POINT TO?
I WOULD SAY THAT AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS TRANSFORMATIVE. IT'S LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS AS A RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE. HONORING THE VOWS OF OUR FOUNDERS, A HEALTHY LIFE, THE LIBERTY TO PURSUE YOUR HAPPINESS THAT CHAINED TO A POLICY IN A JOB YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE BUT FREE TO FOLLOW YOUR PASSION AND ASPIRATION. THIS IS A FABULOUS THING. IT'S ABOUT WELLNESS, IT'S ABOUT TECHNOLOGY TO HAVE A COMMON MEDICAL RECORDS THAT EVERYBODY'S HEALTH IS IMPROVED. THE POOREST PERSON'S IN THE COUNTRY IS IMPROVED. IT'S A GREAT THING. IT HASN'T BEEN MESSAGED PROPERLY. THAT'S A FRUSTRATION I HAVE. THOSE WHO HAVE DONE A LOT TO PASS THE BILL MANY OF US IN CONGRESS ARE TOTALLY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE WEB SITE THING, NOT JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT MAKES GOVERNMENT LOOK BAD BUT BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPEDIMENT TO PEOPLE GETTING THEIR INSURANCE FIRST AND FOREMOST.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT THAT WE AMONG THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS WOULD LIKE TO PUT FORTH AND RELIEVE SOME OF THE CYNICISM AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE POLICY IS REFORM HOW WE CAMPAIGN. WE MUST REDUCE THE ROLE OF MONEY IN POLITICS BECAUSE THAT --
Jon: WHY CAN'T YOU? WHY IS THAT SO HARD? EVEN FOR YOU. A CONGRESS PERSON'S JOB TO BE QUITE FRANK SOUNDS HELLISH. HONESTLY DOES. I'VE BEEN READING THAT YOU HAVE TO SPEND FOUR TO FIVE HOURS A DAY FUND-RAISING. THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST -- THEY WORK ON ISSUES BUT THEY HAVE TO SPEND FOUR TO FIVE DAYS -- FOUR TO FIVE HOURS A DAY FUND-RAISING. YOU YOURSELF CLEARLY STATED YOU WANT MONEY OUT OF GOVERNMENT. YOU RAISED WHAT $30 MILLION THIS YEAR.
YES. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. YOU HAVE TO RAISE MONEY IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION SO THAT YOU CAN PASS LEGISLATION TO DO FOUR THINGS. I'VE ISSUED A DARE. PASS LEGISLATION, DISCLOSE, WHERE IS THIS UNDISCLOSED SPECIAL INTEREST MONEY COME FROM? THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW. AMEND THE CONSTITUTION TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED. [  APPLAUSE  ] THREE, THIS PAST WEEK WAS THE FOUR YEAR ANNIVERSARY AND THAT WAS REALLY A TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE, THAT DECISION BY THE COURT.
Jon: SURE, SURE.
THREE IS REFORM. WE HAVE A BILL WE'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE THIS WEEK THAT IS ABOUT CITIZENS PAYING FOR ELECTIONS, PUBLIC FINANCING OF ELECTIONS.
Jon: RIGHT. [  APPLAUSE  ]
TO AMPLIFY THE VOICES OF SMALL DONORS SO MEMBERS AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO RUN DON'T HAVE TO DEPEND ON CALLING PEOPLE. THAT IT'S RIGHT THERE TO HAVE MANY MORE PEOPLE IN SMALLER DONATIONS TO SUPPORT A CAMPAIGN. AND THAT'S -- THERE, DISCLOSE, AMEND, REFORM AND --
Jon: YOU WERE THROWING OUT AN ACRONYM. I THOUGHT IT WAS GETTING SCHOOL YARD CHALLENGE.
AND EMPOWER. NOTHING SUPPRESSES THE VOTE MORE THAN THE SUFFOCATION OF THE AIRWAVES BY BIG UNDISCLOSED MONEY. IT CONFUSES THE MESSAGE AND PEOPLE THROW UP THEIR HANDS AND SAY A POX ON BOTH YOUR HOUSES WHY SHOULD I VOTE?
Jon: IF THAT IS THE ISSUE, IT IS NOT IN ANY WAY PART OF THE CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW. EVEN AFTER MCCAIN-FEINGOLD IT HAS ABSOLUTELY ERODED. IT'S NOT A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. IT SOUNDS LIKE PIE IN THE SKY. AND HOW DO YOU CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT EVEN IF THEY DID IT IT WOULD BE EXECUTED IN A MANNER THAT IS FAIR AND NOT CORRUPT.
LET'S GET BACK TO YOUR FIRST POINT.
IT'S ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS GETTING OUT THE MESSAGE MORE STRONGLY. YOU WANT TO GET IT OUT THERE WITHOUT SAYING THE SYSTEM IS CORRUPT WE HAVE TO HAVE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.
Jon: WHY? WHY? IT IS CORRUPT. THE SYSTEM IS CORRUPT.
THE SYSTEM ISN'T CORRUPT. THERE'S CORRUPTION IN THE SYSTEM BUT IT ISN'T CORRUPT.
Jon: IT FEELS TO ME LIKE IT'S UTTERLY OVERRUN BY MONIED INTEREST. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU THINK THAT I DON'T SEE THAT. I DO BECAUSE THE PUBLIC PAINTS EVERYBODY WITH THE SAME BRUSH.
Jon: TELL US WHAT WE'RE MISSING.
WHAT YOU ARE MISSING IS THE FIGHT THAT WE'RE HAVING ON ISSUES IN WASHINGTON WHETHER YOU ARE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT, CLIMATE, SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS THIS. BIG OIL, POWER, COAL MONEY SUPPRESSES THAT. AND THAT MONEY IS ENDLESS. AN ENDLESS SPIGOT. SO THAT'S SPECIAL INTEREST MONEY WEIGHING IN. YOU JUST MADE MY ARGUMENT. THAT'S THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.
Jon: THAT'S UNFAIR. TO SUGGEST THAT THE DEMOCRATS DON'T TAKE ENERGY MONEY.
THEY TAKE SOME.
Jon: TO SUGGEST THAT THE DEMOCRATS DON'T TAKE BIG MONEY IS UTTERLY UNFAIR AND UNTRUE.
ADS ON TV. YOU SEE TV YOU THINK EVERY OIL COMPANY IS DOING ALL THIS STUFF FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY. THEY ARE NOT. CLEAN COAL IS AN OXYMORON.
Jon: THOSE ADS MEAN NOTHING.
IT MEANS SOMETHING IN ELECTIONS.
Jon: WHEN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE OFFICES OF WASHINGTON WHEN THOSE LOBBYISTS HAVE ACCESS TO OUR LEGISLATORS IN A MANNER THAT IS NOT --
YOU LOOK AT THE VOTES. YOU LOOK AT THE VOTES.
Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. [  APPLAUSE  ]
YOU LOOK AT THE VOTES. THE DEMOCRATS PASSED THE CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION. THAT BIG MONEY WENT AFTER EVERY MEMBER WHO VOTED FOR ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. BIG COAL. BIG OIL. WE HAD TO FIGHT EVERYBODY IN THAT. THE CAR PATCH HAS GONE OFF TO MUCH MORE SUCCESS. THE GAS PATCH IS A BRIDGE TO RENEWABLES AND GOING ITS OWN ROUTE. SO IT'S JUST THE OIL PATCH AND COAL PATCH WHICH ARE -- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THIS. BECAUSE IT'S AS FUNDAMENTAL AS THE AIR WE BREATHE AND THE WATER WE DRINK. YES, THERE MAY BE DEMOCRATS THAT ACCEPT THAT MONEY BUT WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT DIFFERENCE THAN WE HAVE A REALLY BIG PROBLEM WITH OUR MESSAGING AND I SUBSCRIBE TO THAT. WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER TO MAKE THAT DECISION.
Jon: I THINK IT'S PICKING A PARTICULAR ISSUE.
IT'S A BIG ISSUE.
Jon: LOOK AT WALL STREET MONEY. THERE ARE DEMOCRATS ESPECIALLY IN NEW YORK TAKE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF THAT MONEY AND THEY DON'T HELP.
WE PASSED DODD FRANK. WE -- THE DEMOCRATS PASSED DODD FRANK.
Jon: LOOK AT THE WAY IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED.
IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED. YOUR FAVORITE VOLKER RULE IS --
Jon: IT'S 900 PAGES LONG WHEN IT USED TO BE TWO PAGES.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING ABOUT THE SYSTEMIC.
WAIT A SECOND. LET ME TELL YOU THIS. THE POINT IS -- [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY POINT IS THIS:  WHEN I TALK ABOUT HOW THOSE RULES GET EXPANDED. A LOT OF THAT EXPANSION IS PURPOSEFUL FROM THE MUCH LARGER CORPORATIONS THAT AFFORD THE LEGAL COUNSEL AND LOBBYISTS THAT ALLOW IT TO CARVE OUT EXCEPTIONS TO CONTINUE TO WHAT THEY DO. WE USED TO HAVE A LAW THAT WAS GLASS-STEAGAL. IT WAS SIMPLE. IT WAS UNCORRUPTABLE. NOW WE HAVE A THING 900 PAGES LONG AND THAT'S MY POINT. WHEN YOU SAY IT'S THE PROCESS IT'S SOMEWHAT CORRUPTED.
I WANT TO GIVE PRESIDENT OBAMA CREDIT. WE PASSED THE LAW. THEY HAVE TO WRITE THE REGULATIONS. THAT'S HOW PEOPLE OBEY THE LAW ACCORDING TO THE REGULATION AND THEY HUNG TOUGH AGAINST THE EXCEPTIONS THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO HAVE THERE. WHILE I THINK THAT PRESIDENT LINCOLN SAID "PUBLIC SENTIMENT IS EVERYTHING." IF I HAD ONE CONCERN ABOUT HOW THINGS HAVE GONE IS WE, THE DEMOCRATS, HAVE NOT BEEN STRONG ENOUGH AND I INCLUDE THE EXECUTIVE AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH IN THAT IN MAKING THE DISTINCTION. CLEARLY YOU PUT EVERYBODY TOGETHER.
Jon: I DON'T PUT THEM TOGETHER EQUALLY BUT WHAT I SUGGEST IS TO SUGGEST THAT ONE PARTY HAS A PROBLEM WITH MONIED INTEREST AND THE OTHER PARTY DOESN'T IS A SOMEWHAT UNFAIR CHARACTERIZATION.
MAYBE IT'S A SOURCE OF HOPE TO SOME OF YOU THAT WHERE WE ARE ON RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT, THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE AGAINST ALL OF THIS, ALL OF THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HAVE THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS I'M AS FRUSTRATED WITH THAT AS POSSIBLE. THAT BEING SAID, THE DEMOCRATS DO THEMSELVES NO FAVORS --
BY?
Jon: WHEN THE PROGRAMS THEY IMPLEMENT ARE NOT EFFICIENT AND AGILE AND WHEN THEY SUGGEST THEY THEMSELVES ARE NOT CORRUPTED BY THE SAME MONEY THAT WE KNOW FLOWS THROUGH THE HALLS. GREEN KNOWS NO PARTY. IT'S BLUE AND RED BUT GREEN IS THE THING. [  APPLAUSE  ]
SINCE YOU USE THE COLOR GREEN, LET ME JUST SAY, WE ARE THE PARTY OF GREEN IN TERMS PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. THE AIR WE BREATHE, THE WATER WE DRINK.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T KNOW HOW PERSUADABLE YOU ARE BUT I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.
Jon: YOU ARE MISSING THE DISTINCTION AND I THINK YOU ARE PAINTING MY CRITICISMS WITH A BROAD BRUSH BY SUGGESTING THAT THIS PARTICULAR CRITICISM IS SOMEHOW SAYING DEMOCRATS ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN REPUBLICANS. I'M NOT SAYING THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
Jon: I'M SAYING THAT DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN REGULATION, STRONG AND EFFECTIVE REGULATION, EFFICIENT REGULATION, A ROLL FOR GOVERNMENT. IF THAT'S WHAT THEY BELIEVE, WHEN THEY CREATE THOSE LAWS THAT IN SOME WAYS ARE AN AMPLIFICATION OF WHAT THEY BELIEVE THEY SHOULD DO IT MORE AND THERE'S ALSO WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY A PROBLEM WITH LOBBYISTS AND CORRUPTION AND A REVOLVING DOOR TO CORPORATIONS BACK AND FORTH AND TO SUGGEST THAT IT ISN'T IS TO NOT LIVE IN REALITY. [  APPLAUSE  ]
WHEN YOU SAY DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN REGULATION WE BELIEVE IN CLEAN AIR, CLEAN WATER, FOOD SAFETY, PUBLIC EDUCATION, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
Jon: GREAT. BUT YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCE.
NO, I AGREE.
Jon: I DON'T THINK WE'RE DISAGREEING.
WHEN WE PUT OUR POLITICAL CAPITAL ON THE LINE TO PASS THESE THINGS WHICH SOMETIMES LOOK LIKE MORE GOVERNMENT THAN SOME PEOPLE WANT, WE MORE THAN ANYBODY WANT THESE TO WORK.
Jon: SURE.
WE DON'T WANT TO JUST PASS THEM TO PASS THEM. THEY MUST WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE TO HELP PEOPLE.
Jon: WE'RE AGREEING.
I SAID YOU ARE RIGHT WE WANT THEM TO HELP PEOPLE. BUT THE FACT THAT SOME BUREAUCRATS ARE RISK AVERSE AND THEY DON'T MOVE AS QUICKLY AS WE LIKE IS DIFFERENT THAN SAYING THEY'VE BEEN CORRUPTED BY MONEY.
Jon: NO QUESTION. IF I GAVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THE SLOWNESS AND LETHARGY AND IDIOCY WAS THE SAME AS CORRUPTION. DON'T PAINT EVERYBODY WITH THAT.
Jon: I WAS PAINTING THE LETHARGIES WITH IT. I'LL GIVE YOU THE NAMES.
NO. OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ARE VERY PATRIOTIC AMERICANS AND THEY DO A GREAT JOB.
Jon: WHOA.
THEY DO A GREAT JOB. I'M SAYING IN THE BUREAUCRACY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE RISK AVERSE.
Jon: YOU HEARD THAT AND YOU THOUGHT I WAS SAYING OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ARE NOT PATRIOTIC. THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD?
NO, I HEARD YOU SAYING.
Jon: THAT CONGRESS HAS A PROBLEM WITH MONEY AND CORPORATE INTEREST.
WE WANT TO PUT THIS FORTH TO REMOVE ALL DOUBT.
Jon: SO I PERSUADED YOU. [  APPLAUSE  ]
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU THAT WE ISSUED THE DARE, THE DISCLOSE, AMEND, REFORM.
Jon: I'M GOING TO SPEND ALL WEEKEND WORKING ON ACRONYMS YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE. ARE YOU HOPEFUL THIS CAN BE IMPROVED.
ABSOLUTELY. NO, NO, NO IT HAS TO BE IMPROVED.
Jon: YES.
THE WAY IT WILL BE IMPROVED IS BY THE PUBLIC WEIGHING. IN THAT'S WHY WE'RE HOPEFUL. AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION IS A BIG DEAL BUT MOBILIZING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AROUND AN AMENDMENT TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED. YOU APPLAUD IT WHEN I SAID AMEND THE CONSTITUTION OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED.
Jon: SURE. I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC'S DISCONTENT IS AN EARNED ONE.
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT.
Jon: I DON'T THINK IT'S IN ANY WAY BASED ON A CYNICISM BASED ON A BROAD BRUSH. I THINK IT'S EARNED AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS IN MANY WAYS WORKED HARD FOR IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
LET ME JUST SAY THIS:  THAT WHILE -- AGAIN NOT -- WE HAD A TIME WHEN WE WORKED TOGETHER DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICANS AND THAT HOPEFULLY WE WILL RETURN TO THAT. I WISH WE COULD HAVE MUCH MORE BIPARTISAN SHIP.
ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S NO QUESTION. I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND AND I SHOULD WHY THE PUBLIC PAINTS US WITH THE SAME BRUSH AS THE REPUBLICANS WHEN IT COMES TO SPECIAL INTEREST MONEY IN WASHINGTON, D.C. SEEING IT SITTING THERE FIRSTHAND EVERY DAY SEEING HOW SPECIAL INTEREST.
Jon: I THINK -- OKAY.
THE BUDGET. WE WANT TO CLOSE THE SPECIAL INTEREST LOOPHOLES THEY DO NOT. I SAY WE COULD GET $38 BILLION BY STOPPING THE SUBSIDY TO BIG OIL AT A TIME WHEN THEY MAKE $1 TRILLION. THEY SAY WHY WOULD YOU SAVE $38 BILLION THAT WAY.
Jon: THERE ARE FARM SUBSIDIES AND THINGS. OKAY.
YOU CAN SAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY BY CUTTING PELL GRANTS.
Jon: YOU WON'T GET PUSHBACK FROM ME THAT THE REPUBLICANS WANT CORPORATE MONEY AT THE EXPENSE OF FOOD STAMPS. THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE FOR ME.
YOU ARE TELLING ME TONIGHT WE HAVE TO GO OUT THERE AND ALMOST TO THE POINT OF INSTILLING FEAR UNTIL PEOPLE TO SAY WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS.
Jon: NOT INSTILLING FEAR. CAN I TELL YOU. WHAT I'M TELLING YOU TONIGHT IS ENOUGH WITH THE FIGHTING. THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF, MAKE THEM WORK. MAKE THEM WORK UNASSAILIBLY SO SO THAT YOU HAVE TANGIBLE RESULTS SO YOU CAN SAY TO PEOPLE THAT OUR ARGUMENT ABOUT GOVERNMENT IS SUCH THAT -- AND HERE IS WHAT WE DID AND HOW WE DID IT. IF YOU MAKE THAT ARGUMENT. THEY'VE SO EMBARRASSED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR KNUCKLEHEADS THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY ESTABLISH THEMSELVES IN A MUCH MORE -- WITH MUCH MORE AUTHORITY THAN EVER BEFORE BUT THEY CONTINUE TO I LIKE TO CALL IT FEAR OF SUCCESS. SELF PREVENT THEMSELVES. I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT ABOUT MESSAGING. IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN SHOWING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT REFORMING THE MECHANISM OF GOVERNMENT AND THE EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT.
TOTALLY AGREE.
Jon: I THINK THAT WOULD BE A BIG DEAL FOR PEOPLE.
TOTALLY AGREE.
Jon: I CONVINCED HER.
YOU CONVINCED ME.
Jon: -- YOU CONVINCED ME.
Jon: NANCY PELOSI. THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
