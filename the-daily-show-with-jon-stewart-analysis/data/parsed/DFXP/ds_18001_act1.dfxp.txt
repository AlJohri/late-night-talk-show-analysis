OCTOBER 1ST, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART.
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. I AM JON STEWART. WE HAVE ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. JOINING US FOR THE FIRST TIME,  THE GOVERNATOR, ARNOLD  SCHWARZENEGGER WILL JOIN US ON  THE PROGRAM. I WONDER WHAT THAT MIGHT HAVE  SOUNDED LIGHT, IT MIGHT HAVE  GONE A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE  THIS.
TAXI?
I HAVE ZERO TO WORK ON THAT  IMPRESSION.
THIS IS THE FIRST  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IS  WEDNESDAY, BIGGEST DAY OF THE  WHOLE YEAR, FOR EDITORS OF PODIUMS MAGAZINE. BOY. A BUYING MAKE OR BREAK MOMENT  FOR BOTH CAMPAIGNS AND THEY ARE  GOING ALL OUT PREPARING.
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND GOVERNOR  MITT ROMNEY ARE PREPARING FOR  WEDNESDAY'S DEBATE ON IN DENVER.
MSNBC OBAMA'S LEAVING ON  SUNDAY FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS OF  DEBATE CAMP.
OH, DEBATE CAMP!
OH I REMEMBER GOING TO DEBATE  CAMP, I REMEMBER LIKE NO SPORTS,  A BITTER RIVAL, CAMP NORMAL  MALFUN.
LET'S SEE IF I REMEMBER THE  DEBATE CAMP STOPPING IF I CAN. â™ª
ON THE SHORES OF LAKE  RHETORIC, WE PRACTICED LOGICAL  CONSISTENCY. WILL BEAT YOUR AD HOMINEM  ATTACKS ON FALSE TAUTOLOGIES. AND LOGICAL FALSIE.
NOT IN THE FACE!  NOT IN THE  FACE!  GETTING YOUR ASS KICK IS  ACTUALLY WRITTEN INTO THE SONG!
SO TWO HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED  MEN TO SEE WHICH ONE BECOMES THE  MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE FREE  WORLD.
ROMNEY HAS TO BE CHOMPING AT  THE BITS.
BETH MYERS TELLS CAMPAIGN  SURROGATES THERE ARE SEVERAL  REASONS SHE BELIEVES THE  PRESIDENT WILL BE LIKELY TO WIN THE FIRST DEBATE.
HE HAS DONE THESE KIND OF  DEBATES BEFORE, THIS IS MITT'S  FIRST TIME ON THIS KIND OF A  STAGE.
OH!
MAYBE HE IS MORE ON HOME AT  THE VEGAS STAGE.
R RATED HYPNOTISTS OR TWO GAY  GERMANS TRYING TO MAKE A WHITE  TIGER DISAPPEAR.
MONKEY ON A BICYCLE. WELL, IF IT IS MITT ROMNEY'S  FIRST TIME AT THE RODEO,  GOVERNOR OBAMA BELIEVES HE HAS  AN ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE.
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO  LOSE THE FIRST DEBATE.
HE IS JUST NOT A GREAT  DEBATOR.
LOOK WHOSE FEELINGS ABOUT  BARACK OBAMA CAME BACK, AND I  GUESS WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTE  STAYED IN CHARLOTTE.
WHEN AMERICAN MARKETS BROKE  DOWN, WHO JUMP-STARTED OUR  ENGINE!  BARACK OBAMA!  AND WHEN  AMERICA NEEDED HIM MOST, WHO GOT US ROLLING AGAIN ON THE ROAD TO  RECOVERY?
BARACK OBAMA!
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, PEOPLE,  WHO COULDN'T GET LAID IN A WHORE  HOUSE WITH A FIST FULL OF  HUNDREDS?  BARACK OBAMA!
THAT'S MY FAVORITE AM WAY  PRESENTATION EVER.
ALL RIGHT, I GET IT TIME  HONORED TRADITION TO ATTACH DOWN  EXPECTATIONS TO MAKE A SLIGHT  WIN.
HERE IS GREAT NEWS FOR  REPUBLICANS, WE HAVE A CANDIDATE  WHO IS GOING TO DO  EXTRAORDINARILY WELL ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT, OH (BLEEP) WE  HAVE A RUNNER!  WE HAVE A  RUNNER!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, CHRISTI?   APPARENTLY NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR    CHRIS CHRISTIE DIDN'T GET THE MEMO THAT ROMNEY SUCKS AT THIS.
I THINK YOU WILL SEE THE  NUMBERS START TO MOVE RIGHT BACK  IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.
IN WHOLE RACE WILL BE TURNED  UPSIDE DOWN COME THURSDAY  MORNING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, CHRISTI?
FOR GOD'S SAKE IF ROMNEY  FAILS TO MEET THOSE HEAVY  EXPECTATIONS HE WILL LOSE THE  GENERAL ELECTION CREATING CHAOS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND  LEAVE OUT 2016 -- OH!
THE JERSEY IS STRONG IN THIS  ONE.
SO ALL THESE GUYS TO HAVE A  MILD FAMILIARITY WITH THE  ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND IT IS  CONSIDERED A WIN. CAN WE HEAR FROM SOMEONE NOT  AFFILIATED WITH THE CAMPAIGNS,  WHAT THEIR EXPECTATION MIGHT BE?
BOTH MEN HAVE A MONUMENTAL  UNDERTAKING FOR THE FIRST  DEBATE, ONE OF THEM HAS TO COME  OFF AS NICER AND LESS AIR BEGAN THAN HE REALLY IS AND THE OTHER  HAS TO BE ZERO MORE NORMAL AND  LESTRANGE THAN HE REALLY IS.
Jon: THEN HOW DID WE END UP  WITH THESE TWO IDIOTS?  LOOK, WE  ARE NOT LOOKING FOR COHERENT  IDEOLOGY, AMERICANS ARE JUST LOOKING FOR ASSURANCE THE NEXT  PRESIDENT ISN'T GOING TO BE A  WEIRDO. WHO THINKS SHE BETTER THAN US. HOW EXACTLY WILL ROMNEY COUNTER  THE IDEA THAT HE IS AWKWARD AND  NOT NORMAL?
MR. ROMNEY'S TEAM CONCLUDED  THE DEBATES ARE ABOUT CREATING  MOMENTS, THE QUICK SERIES OF  ZINGERS HE HAS MEMORIZED AND HAS BEEN PRACTICING ON AIDES SINCE  AUGUST.
Jon: THEY EQUIPPED HIM WITH  ZINGERS.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?  THE BEST  ZINGERS ARE TWO ONES YOU  PRACTICE FOR TWO MONTHS.
A PRIEST AND A RABBI WALK  INTO A BAR. IT IS A BAR FOR HOMOSEXUALS. THE PRIEST AND THE RABBI FALL IN  LOVE AND GET MARRIED BECAUSE OF  BARACK OBAMA!  ZING!
I WILL TELL YOU THIS, PEOPLE. I WOULD NOT (BLEEP) BARACK  OBAMA'S ECONOMY WITH THE  (BLEEP). ZING!
ZING!
THE CANDIDATES ARE PREPARING  FOR WEDNESDAY'S DEBATE WE GO TO  SENIOR CORRESPONDENT AASIF  MANDVI.
YOU ARE WITH THE ROMNEY CAMP,  HOW IS HE DOING?
HE IS PREPPING THE BEST HE  CAN, JON, BUT YOU HATE TO SEE AN  UPHILL BATTLE LIKE THIS, THIS IS THE PRESIDENT, THE GREATEST OR  FOR THIS, ORATOR THIS COUNTRY  HAS SEEN SINCE LINCOLN.
LIKE I MEAN, MITT ROMNEY,  TALK ABOUT BRILLIANT TWO,  HARVARD DEGREES, THE GUY HAS  NEVER EVEN LOST AN ARGUMENT, HE IS NO SLOUCH, I MEAN, HE IS THE  PRESIDENT.
SMOKE AND MIRRORS, JON, RIGHT  NOW THEY ARE DRILLING HIM ON  BASIC GRAMMAR SKILLS. HOPING TO GET SOME AGREEMENT  DURING THIS DEBATE.
ROMNEY'S PEOPLE ARE JUST  HOPING HE REMAINS UP RIGHT.
HE IS A BUYING NAPPER, JON,  BUYING NAPPER.
MITT ROMNEY, 90 MINUTES AWAKE  AND UP RIGHT MEANS BUYING WIN  FOR THE CAMP.
Jon: WELL, I CERTAINLY  IMAGINE ROMNEY WILL ACCOMPLISH  THAT.
BARACK OBAMA CAN ONLY COUNT  TO 27.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
MITT ROMNEY HAS NEVER GONE  MORE THAN 17 MINUTES WITHOUT  BLURTING OUT THE N WORD.
Jon: REALLY?
THE N WORD!
BARACK OBAMA GETS THROUGH  THIS DEBATE WITHOUT PULLING OUT  HIS DONG AND SWINGING IT AROUND  WHILE YELLING CHECK OUT MARINE ONE!  IT WILL BE A VICTORY!
IF ONLY MITT ROMNEY KNEW HOW  TO USE A ZIPPER HE COULD ZIPPER  THE NAME OF ONE OF HIS SONS.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, GUYS, SLOW  DOWN. IF MITT ROMNEY DOESN'T PASS OUT.
NOT LIKELY BUT IFED HAPPENS,  BUYING VICTORY.
Jon: AND IF BARACK OBAMA  KEEPS HIS (BLEEP) IN HIS PANTS
I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING  BUT FINGERS CROSS, THAT WOULD BE  A HUGE, HUGE VICTORY.
Jon: WILL HELP AMERICANS  DECIDE WHICH ONE OF THESE  FUNCTIONAL MAN CHILDREN IS  BEST-EQUIPPED TO BRING AMERICA BACK TO GREATNESS.
YEP.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH,
