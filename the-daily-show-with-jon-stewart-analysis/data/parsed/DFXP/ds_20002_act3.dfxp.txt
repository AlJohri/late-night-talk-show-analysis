Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN ACTOR WHOSE LATEST FILM IS CALLED "GONE GIRL."
SO, YOUR WIFE HAS NO FRIENDS HERE. IS SHE KIND OF STAND OFFISH, IVY LEAGUE? RUBS PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY?
SHE'S FROM NEW YORK. SHE'S COMPLICATED. SHE'S GOT VERY HIGH STANDARDS.
TYPE A. WELL, THAT CAN MAKE YOU CRAZY IF YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT. YOU SEEM PRETTY LAID BACK, TYPE B. SPEAKING OF WHICH, AMY'S BLOOD TYPE.
GOD, I DON'T KNOW, I'D HAVE TO LOOK IT UP AT THE HOUSE.
YOU DON'T KNOW IF SHE HAS FRIENDS, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE DOES ALL DAY AND YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR WIFE'S BLOOD TYPE.
ARE YOU SURE Y'ALL ARE MARRIED?
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, BEN AFFLECK! ♪♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I'LL TELL YOU IN A SECOND WHAT MADE ME LAUGH. TERRIBLE. SO, SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MADE ME LAUGH. SO YOU'RE BEEFING UP OBVIOUSLY FOR THE BATMAN ROLE, BUT WHEN YOU CAME UP ON TO THE STAIRS AND WE HAD A LITTLE BRO HUG, IT WAS VERY LITTLE.
A TASTE.
Jon: A TASTE. I REALLY FELT LIKE YOUR SON AFTER A LITTLE LEAGUE GAME. LIKE WHEN YOU CAME OUT LIKE THAT I WAS LIKE THANKS DAD, THANKS FOR COMING. (LAUGHTER)
INFIELD SINGLE IS AS GOOD AS ANYTHING ELSE, KID. A WALK IS AS GOOD AS A HIT, JON, YOU DID GREAT.
Jon: WALK IS GOOD AS A HIT! WALK IS AS GOOD AS A HIT. BOY, THIS...
YOU KNOW WHAT, CAN WE JUST, WE HAD A BIT, BUT I JUST WANT...
Jon: YES.
TO GO BACK BECAUSE SOMETHING'S BEEN ON MY MIND.
Jon: PLEASE. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.
YOU KNOW THAT I DID A, LET ME START HERE...
Jon: YEAH.
YOU DIRECTED A MOVIE, RIGHT? A MOVIE CALLED ROSE WATER, IS THAT RIGHT?
I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YES. SO THIS...
Jon: MAYBE COMING OUT IN NOVEMBER.
SURE THAT'S GREAT. SO THIS MOVIE, THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT IRAN, RIGHT? I MEAN THERE'S SOME IRAN IN THAT MOVIE?
Jon: IT TAKES PLACE IN, BUT IT'S REALLY A UNIVERSAL STORY OF HOPE.
NO, NO.
Jon: IT'S REALLY UH... IT DOES TAKE PLACE IN UH... (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S TERRIFIC. BUT DO YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO, YOU KNOW, I DID A MOVIE ABOUT IRAN. RIGHT?
Jon: NOW I'M NOT...
WELL I'M TRYING TO THINK IF THERE'S LIKE A LESS BABYISH WORD THAN COPY CAT. BUT I DON'T UH...
Jon: WHAT MOVIE? WHAT WAS THE NAME? BECAUSE I DON'T...
WELL, ORIGINALLY IT WAS CALLED "ARG-ROSEWATER."
Jon: I THOUGHT... AND THEN SOME (BLEEP) GUY MADE ROSEWATER, SO...
Jon: I THOUGHT...
WHO WOULD CALL A MOVIE "ARGO" JUST OFF THE BAT, YOU KNOW?
Jon: I THOUGHT YOU DIRECTED FARGO. I'M TERRIBLY SORRY. I THOUGHT, NOW I FEEL BADLY. IT TURNS OUT, THAT THEY INCARCERATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON. BUT YOU, LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU AND THE WORK YOU'RE GOING.
Jon: THE GOOD WORK YOU'RE DOING.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THE TREMENDOUS WORK YOU'RE DOING.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THIS "GONE GIRL," FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE IN TWO OF THE MOST HIGHLY ANTICIPATED MOVIES, YOU'VE GOT "GONE GIRL," YOU'VE GOT "BATMAN VERSUS SUPERMAN." TWO OF THE MOST HIGHLY ANTICIPATED, HIGHLY SECRETIVE, AND THIS IS NO, AND I HATE TO DO THIS, BUT IT'S, OKAY, HERE'S THE THING, IF I CAN?
DON'T GIVE ANYTHING AWAY.
Jon: STOP IT.
OKAY, NO.
Jon: SO, IN "GONE GIRL," HE KILLS HIS WIFE. IN BATMAN AND SUPERMAN, SUPERMAN DEFEATS BATMAN, SO IT'S, IT'S --
WHAT THE (BLEEP)!
Jon: I'M JUST TELLING THEM...
ARE YOU (BLEEP) KIDDING ME? I HAVE A (BLEEP) TALK WITH YOU FIVE MINUTES AGO IN THE THING AND IT'S LIKE HEY, WE'RE IN SHOW BUSINESS, CUT ME IN ON THE THING -- YOU PUT IT ON THE SHOW! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU DID NOT SAY DON'T TELL EVERYBODY ON THE SHOW! YOU SAID TO ME --
THE MOVIE COMES OUT IN MARCH OF 2016!
Jon: BUT THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO WAIT! I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT THEM TO WAIT.
IT TOOK TWO YEARS... IT'S ACTUALLY COOL.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.
THIS IS, LISTEN, SO THIS IS SO THIS IS HIGHLY ANTICIPATED. DAVID FINCHER "GONE GIRL," WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS  "BATMAN VERSUS SUPERMAN" LATER.
JUST SORT OF...
Jon: FINCHER IS PHENOMENAL.
NO, HE'S GREAT. HE'S GREAT. AND FOR THIS FILM, (LAUGHTER) FOR THIS FILM, WHAT THEY WANTED, I DON'T WANT TO SAY GHOST DIRECTOR, BUT, YOU KNOW, DAVID'S --
Jon: OH, DID HE COME TO YOU FOR A LOT OF ADVICE?
A LOT OF HELP.

Jon: SO IN TERMS OF CASTING MAYBE THE ENTIRE MOVIE, THAT'S MOSTLY YOU. ROSAMUND PIKE, WHO'S THIS AMAZING ACTRESS.
VIRTUALLY EVERY SHOT IN THE MOVIE, I AM ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR.
Jon: REALLY?

Jon: YOU'D LOVE THAT.
NO BUT, THE TRUTH IS, DAVID IS AN AMAZING --
Jon: THE GUY'S BRILLIANT.
MASTER.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE,  IT WAS AS MUCH ABOUT GETTING TO ACT FOR HIM WHICH IS REALLY GREAT BECAUSE HE REALLY PROTECTS YOU AND HE'S SO SMART AND HE MADE SUCH A SMART MOVIE AND IT'S ALSO LIKE STEALING STUFF AS A DIRECTOR. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Jon: YOU CHECK HIM OUT, YOU SEE WHAT HE'S DOING...
I'LL DO THAT.
Jon: AND THESE ARE BOTH THE KIND OF MOVIES. THE FANDOM FOR BATMAN AND SUPERMAN AND, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE IN, YOU'RE IN THE SWAMPS, MAN...

(LAUGHTER) IT MAKES ME WONDER, WHAT DO YOU NEED THE GRAPPLING HOOK FOR AND SMOKE BOMB IF YOU CAN KICK PEOPLE'S ASSES JUST NORMALLY.
IT'S -- THAT RULES ME OUT, BUT, YES, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. YOU HAVE TO, LIKE YOU, FOR ROSE-ARGO --
Jon: STOP IT.
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO GET IN SHAPE.
Jon: I DO THINK THAT YOU MADE A MISTAKE GOING UP AGAINST SUPERMAN BECAUSE HE'S SUPERMAN.
HE'S NO JOKE, I'LL TELL YOU THAT.
Jon: HE'S NO JOKE, I MEAN HE CAN FLY. LIKE NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU DO, HE CAN FLY.
HE CAN. YEAH. YOU DIDN'T GET HERE BY ACCIDENT, MY FRIEND.
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THOUGH, YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIGHT WITH SUPERMAN AND YOU'RE LIKE -- YOU KNOW -- (LAUGHTER) AND THEN SUPERMAN IS JUST LIKE, MMMMM (BLEEP) HIS LASERS AT YOU (BLEEP). AND THEN HE JUST FLIES, LIKE -- (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, YOU CAN THROW LIKE YOUR NET, YOU'RE DONE!
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T GOING TO SPOIL THIS. (LAUGHTER) THERE'S NO WAY. THERE IT IS.
Jon: IS THAT?
THAT IS THE SMOKE PELLET, YEAH. AND NOW YOU'VE GIVEN IT AWAY ALONGSIDE THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE AND MY OTHER MOVIE. SO THAT'S ABOUT IT.
