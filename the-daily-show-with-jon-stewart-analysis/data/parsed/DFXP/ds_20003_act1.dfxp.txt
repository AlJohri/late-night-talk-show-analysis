FROM COMEDY  CENTRAL'S WORLD VIEW HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A VERY GOOD SHOW  TONIGHT. MY GUEST -- OH, WE LOVE, WE LOVE THIS  LADY. LENA DUNHAM IS GOING TO BE  JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM. VERY TALENTED. VERY FUNNY. BUT FIRST, SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE BEEN  READING ABOUT A RECENT  INCIDENT AT OUR WHITE HOUSE.
THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE CAPTURED A MAN WHO HAS JUMPED THE WHITE HOUSE FENCE AND MADE IT INSIDE THE BUILDING. A SPOKESMAN SAYS THE MAN WAS  NOT ARMED. HE WAS CAUGHT JUST AFTER  PASSING THROUGH THE NORTH  PORTICO DOORS.
OH, THAT DOESN'T SOUND THAT BAD. SOUNDS LIKE YOUR AVERAGE OVERLY COMFORTABLE TOURIST PROBABLY LATE FOR THE TOUR.  OR PERHAPS THE SECRET  SERVICE IS UNDERSELLING THIS  INCIDENT.
GONZALEZ ENTERED THE  UNLOCKED FRONT DOOR OF THE  EXECUTIVE MANSION.
HE THEN RAN MORE THAN 30  FEET THROUGH THE ENTRANCE  HALL TO THE CROSS HALL.
GONZALEZ THEN OVERPOWERED  AN AGENT AND RAN A HUNDRED  FEET INTO THE EAST ROOM.
WHERE COUNTLESS WHITE HOUSE  RECEPTIONS AND PUBLIC  CEREMONIES ARE HELD, THAT  INCLUDED PARTIES FOR HEADS OF  STATE. EVEN FRANK SINATRA.
WAS CARRYING A THREE AND A HALF INCH KNIFE.
HAD 800 ROUNDS OF AMMO, TWO  HATCHETS AND A MACHETE IN HIS  CAR. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OH. NOW YOU MAY WONDER HOW THEY  KNEW WHAT WAS IN HIS CAR. HE HAD THAT DECAL. THAT'S HOW THEY, THEY'RE SO ADORABLE. BUT, BY THE WAY, THAT WAS A REALLY WEIRD SINATRA REFERENCE, NO? I THINK KNOWING THAT THE LONG  DECEASED OLD BLUE EYES HAD  BEEN IN THAT VERY ROOM REALLY  BROUGHT HOME THE URGENCY OF  THE ATTACK. HOW DID THIS INTRUDER GET SO  FAR INTO THE WHITE HOUSE? DON'T THEY HAVE, DON'T THEY HAVE GUARD DOGS  THERE.
THERE WERE A LOT OF  OFFICERS THERE, AND THERE WAS  CONCERN THE DOGS MIGHT ATTACK  THEM INSTEAD. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SOUNDS STRANGE, BUT IT MAKES MORE SENSE WHEN YOU FIND  OUT A LOT OF SECRET SERVICE  AGENTS ARE CATS. (LAUGHTER) SO, SO, SO THE DOGS DID NOT GET THE INTRUDER. DO THEY HAVE ALARMS?
THERE'S AN ALARM BOX NEAR THE FRONT ENTRANCE THAT'S SUPPOSEED TO ALERT GUARDS OF AN INTRUSION, BUT APPARENTLY IT HAD BEEN GOING  OFF A LOT, AND SO IT WAS ON MUTE BECAUSE IT WAS BOTHERING  STAFFERS.
Jon: YOU CAN'T DO THAT! YOU CAN'T JUST TURN OFF THE  ALARM BECAUSE IT'S IRRITATING. THIS IS THE WHITE HOUSE. NOT A '97 HONDA CIVIC THAT'S PARKED ON YOUR BLOCK AT 3:00 AM. NOW IT WOULD BE ONE THING IF THIS POSSIBLY LETHAL GAME OF FREEZE TAG WAS A ONE OFF FLUKE. BUT, THANKS TO THE SECRET SERVICE, THE PRESIDENT'S HAD A LOT OF CLOSE CALLS.
THE SECURITY GUARD WAS  INAPPROPRIATELY TAKING PHOTOS  OF THE PRESIDENT INSIDE AN ELEVATOR, WHO TURNED OUT HAD A GUN.
THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE MISHANDLED A SHOOTING INCIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE BACK IN 2011.
THE SEVEN SHOTS WEREN'T  DISCOVERED FOR FOUR DAYS.
Jon: FOUR DAYS! IT TOOK THE WHITE HOUSE ONLY A  LITTLE LESS TIME TO FIND OUT  THEY'D BEEN HIT BY BULLETS  THAN IT TOOK JAMES FRANCO TO  SAW OFF HIS OWN ARM. (LAUGHTER) HIS OWN ARM!  [ APPLAUSE ] AND SO YESTERDAY THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE CALLED SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR JULIA PIERSON TO TESTIFY ABOUT THESE ISSUES. IT DID NOT GO WELL.
THE BULLETS WERE NOT DISCOVERED TO HAVE HIT THE  WHITE HOUSE IN REAL-TIME  WITHIN A 24 HOUR OR GREATER  PERIOD BY THE SECRET SERVICE. YES OR NO, PLEASE.
THERE WAS REPORTS OF SHOTS BEING FIRED IN PROXIMITY TO  CONSTITUTION AVENUE.
YOU HAVE OFFICERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE DRAWING THEIR WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE SHOTS WERE FIRED. NOW GIVE ME ALL THE EVIDENCE  TO SUPPORT A VEHICLE BACKFIRE.
IN DOWNTOWN AREAS THERE IS  SOUND ATTENUATION OFTEN TIMES --
I'VE NEVER HEARD A CAR  BACKFIRE SIX TO EIGHT TIMES.
I DO NOT --
I HAVE NEVER. HAVE YOU?
I'VE HEARD CARS BACKFIRE, BUT I DON'T THINK --
SIX TO EIGHT TIMES?
THE INITIAL SHOOTING INCIDENT OCCURRED AT 9:30 AT NIGHT. IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE AT NIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO THAT'S SECRET SERVICE. THEY BELIEVED BASICALLY THAT WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS WHEN SOMEONE SHOOTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AT NIGHT. YOU CAN GET A FLASHLIGHT AND  LOOK AROUND, OR ONLY HAVE A  PRESIDENT DURING DAYLIGHT  HOURS. I MEAN, IT'S DARK. YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SEND MY AGENTS OUT THERE? THERE COULD BE A BOOGIE MAN, ANY TYPE OF GOBLIN OR GREMLIN. IT'S VERY FRIGHTENING. HERE'S HOW DYSFUNCTIONAL THE SECRET SERVICE IS AT THIS POINT. CONGRESS HAD TO HELP THEM COME UP  WITH SOLUTIONS.
HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO  LOCK THE FRONT DOOR OF THE  WHITE HOUSE?
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF  THESE GUYS? WE COULD EVEN PUT VEGETATION BARRIERS, SIMPLE THINGS LIKE HOW ABOUT SPANISH BAYONETS. YOU JUMP THAT FENCE, AND YOU  GET QUITE A GREETING WHEN YOU  HIT THE GROUND.
Jon: A LOCK, AND ALARM SYSTEM, OR SPIKY PLANTS. YOU NEVER WANT TO BE IN A  POSITION WHERE YOU ARE CHARGED  WITH GUARDING THE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES, AND YOU  COULD BE REPLACED BY A PLANT. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, FOR ANY OF YOU OUT THERE WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT A SPANISH BAYONET WAS, AND THOUGHT GEEZ, WHY DON'T I LOOK THAT UP ON THE URBAN DICTIONARY. I'M GOING TO SAVE YOU THE  TROUBLE. SPANISH BAYONET IS WHEN "YOU  TAKE YOUR PENIS AND PUT IT IN  A STAND AND STUFF TACO, YOU ADD YOUR DESIRED TACO FILLING, AND THEN YOU FEED THE SPANISH BAYONET TO YOUR PARTNER." (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT IT,  WHOEVER WROTE THAT, YOU PROBABLY  WON'T CLIMB HIS (BLEEP) FENCE. ANY OTHER IDEAS FOR DETERING  FENCE JUMPERS?
I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER YOU  HAVE CONSIDERED SIMPLY ASKING  THAT A HIGHER FENCE BE BUILT? ONE, THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, COULD  CURVE SO MAYBE YOU DAMAGE A  BODY PART IF YOU TRY TO GET  OVER IT.
HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING? THESE PEOPLE PUT THEY'RE DICKS IN TACOS. THEY'RE NOT SCARED OF BODY  PART DAMAGE. MAYBE I'M BEING MORE DISMISSIVE THAN I SHOULD BE. NOBODY ON THE COMMITTEE  SUGGESTED ANY TRULY TERRIBLE  IDEAS.
IT SHOULD BE OVERWHELMING FORCE. IF A WOULD BE INTRUDER CAN'T BE STOPPED BY A DOG OR INTERCEPTED BY A PERSON, PERHAPS MORE LETHAL FORCE IS  NECESSARY. IF THEY WANT TO PENETRATE  THAT, THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT  THEY ARE GOING TO PERHAPS BE  KILLED. THAT'S THE MESSAGE WE SHOULD  BE SENDING EVERY SINGLE TIME.
Jon: OKAY. ANYONE HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO JUDGE DREDD'S PROPOSAL.
I WAS TRAINED IN THAT YOU  ONLY USE AS MUCH FORCE AS IT  ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SUBDUE  OR FIX THE PROBLEM. NEVER ANY MORE UNDO FORCE.
THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING  TO HAVE A SHOOT-OUT ON THE  WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS SEEMS TO  ME A LAST RESORT, NOT A FIRST  RESORT.
YOU'VE HEARD MANY MEMBERS  BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE THOUGHT  THAT WE WOULD HAVE SORT OF A  SHOOT TO KILL FIRST, AND , OF COURSE, I THINK ABOUT  EARLIER -- I THINK IN THIS YEAR  WE HAD A TODDLER BREACH THE  FENCE.
Jon: TAKE THE SHOT. I SAID TAKE THE SHOT. I KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THE  TARGET IS CARRYING A DIRTY  BOMB IN HIS BOOM BOOM. IN HIS BOOM BOOM! FOR MORE WE TURN TO SENIOR WHITE HOUSE  CORRESPONDENT, JORDAN KLEPPER. JORDAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. (LAUGHTER) JORDAN, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? [ APPLAUSE ]
SECURITY IS SUPER TIGHT HERE, JON. I TRIED TO ENTER THROUGH THE  NORTH PORTICO, BUT THE STEPS  WERE MYSTERIOUSLY COVERED IN  ICE. AS I SLIPPED, I GRABBED ON TO  A DOORKNOB WHICH TO MY  SURPRISE WAS SCALDINGLY HOT. SO I TRIED THE BACK ENTRANCE. BUT WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR, A  BUCKET OF GLUE FELL ON MY  HEAD CAUSING ME TO STUMBLED INTO A TRIP WIRE  THAT ACTIVATED A FEATHER CANNON.
Jon: AND THE IRON MARK ON YOUR  FACE?
OH, I JUST HAD SOME TROUBLE IRONING THIS MORNING. (LAUGHTER)
ALRIGHT, SO BASICALLY TO PROTECT HIMSELF, OBAMA HAS HOME ALONED THE WHITE HOUSE.
WELL, IT STOPPED THE WET BANDITS, DIDN'T  IT?
NO, NO, IT DIDN'T STOP THE WET BANDITS! WHAT STOPPED THEM WAS A LONELY MAN WITH A SNOW SHOVEL AND A HEART OF GOLD.
OKAY, WHATEVER.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT STOPPED THEM.
IT SOFTENED THEM UP A BIT.
Jon: IT MADE THEM MADDER. IT MADE THE WET BANDITS -- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF  WE CAN ENTRUST THE PRESIDENT'S  SAFETY TO A SYSTEM OF WHIMSICAL TRAPS.
TO DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE,  JON. LOOK, NOBODY'S GOING TO WANT TO GO NEAR THE PRESIDENT NOW THAT HE HAS EBOLA.
Jon: WHAT WHAT WAIT WHAT? THE PRESIDENT HAS EBOLA? HOW DID THE PRESIDENT GET EBOLA?
WELL, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,  EBOLA JUST JUMPED THE FENCE  AND WALKED THROUGH THE FRONT  DOOR.
Jon: NO ONE THERE NOTICED? NONE OF THE SECURITY NOTICED A  SIX FOOT TALL YELLOW VIRUS  ENTERING THE WHITE HOUSE?
NOPE, NOPE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT WAS A  FEW DAYS BEFORE ANYBODY  NOTICED ANYTHING STRANGE. PEOPLE FINALLY GOT SUSPICIOUS WHEN IN A CABINET MEETING EBOLA PROPOSED A NATIONWIDE INITIATIVE TO PROMOTE SPITTING IN EACH OTHER'S MOUTHS. PLUS IT KEPT ASKING WHICH ROOM FRANK SINATRA HAD BEEN IN.
Jon: YOU KNOW, EBOLA IS A VERY SERIOUS DISEASE. IS THE PRESIDENT GOING TO BE  OKAY?
HE'LL BE FINE. THE EBOLA ISN'T GOING TO STICK AROUND VERY LONG. IT SAYS IT DOESN'T FEEL SAFE  IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, JORDAN. THANK YOU. JORDAN KLEPPER EVERYBODY. THANK YOU.
