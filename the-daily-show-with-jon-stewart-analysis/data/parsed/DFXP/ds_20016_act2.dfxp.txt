Jon: YOU KNOW, FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR WEEK HERE. AUSTINITES, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE KEEPING IT -- OH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE PHRASE IS -- WEIRD? (AUDIENCE REACTS) WEIRD, THAT'S IT. BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THERE IS ONE THING ABOUT AUSTIN THAT WE FOUND TRULY BIZARRE. SAMANTHA BEE REPORTS.
IF THERE'S ONE THING PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT AUSTIN, TEXAS, IT'S WEIRD! HOW DOES AUSTIN KEEP IT WEIRD?
OH, THEY HAVE A LOT OF REALLY CRAZY, KOOKY PEOPLE HERE.
OKAY. LAST WEEK I SAW A GUY WITH A -- LIKE A BORE RAT KIND OF THING JUST RIDING A BICYCLE.
OKAY.
I WAS WALKING DOWN SIXTH STREET ON LIKE A SATURDAY NIGHT AND THERE WAS A WOMAN ABOUT NO TOP ON.
WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT AUSTIN? YES, AUSTIN IS KNOWN AS THE FREE-THINKING, LEFT LEANING, DISTINCTLY LIBERAL BLUEBERRY IN THE TOMATO SOUP OF TEXAS. I COULD ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THEIR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS LOOK LIKE.
WHO'S YOUR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE?
IT IS ROGER WILLIAMS. ROGER WILLIAMS! OH, MY GOD! HE SOUNDS AMAZING! WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE? IS HE JUST COVERED IN TATTOOS, HE'S GOT, OH MY GOD, HE'S GOT LIKE THOSE PIERCINGS AND HE SELLS DREAM CATCHERS AND --
THAT'S NOT ROGER WILLIAMS AT ALL.
HE PROBABLY HAS A DAUGHTER NAMED SUNBEAM OR WHATEVER. AND HE TURNED HIS NAVEL INTO A STASH POCKET?
NO, NOT AT ALL.
HE'S AN OLD WHITE GUY. HE'S A REPUBLICAN. SO THERE YOU GO. THERE'S THAT.
WE HAVE FIVE REPUBLICANS THAT REPRESENT AUSTIN IN CONGRESS.
FIVE REPUBLICANS REPRESENT AUSTIN IN CONGRESS OUT OF HOW MANY?
OUT OF SIX. OKAY, THERE GOES MY PROGRESSIVE LADY BONER. I'M TOTALLY FLACID NOW. THEY'RE ONLY REPUBLICAN LIKE IRONICALLY, THOUGH, RIGHT?
NO, THEY LEGITIMATELY HAVE THE R IN FRONT AND THEY EMBODY THAT R.
IN A CITY SO LIBERAL THAT THE ONLY RIGHT-LEANING MAYORAL CANDIDATE APPARENTLY RAN ON A BET, SOMEHOW FIVE OF SIX CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES ARE STAUNCHLY REPUBLICAN. MICHAEL MCCAUL VOTED TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD, LAMAR SMITH CALLED THE DREAM ACT A NIGHTMARE. ROGER WILLIAMS SAYS PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A SOCIALIST. THIS GUY CO-SPONSORED THE BIRTHER BILL. EVEN THE LONE DEMOCRAT LOOKS LIKE HE COULD FIRE YOUR FATHER. IF ONLY THERE WERE AN EXPERT TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY HOW THIS HAPPENED.
REDISTRICTING OR GERRYMANDERING IS WHEN THEY REDRAW THE VOTING MAPS IN ORDER TO ENSURE A CONSTITUENCY THAT WILL BRING THEM BACK TO OFFICE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT POLITICIANS DO TO MANIPULATE THE VOTING PROCESS.
OH, THAT'S VERY GOOD. THAT'S VERY GOOD. WOULD YOU LIKE A CRICKET? THE REPUBLICAN-DRAWN MAPS WORKS SO HARD TO BREAK UP AUSTIN INTO CONSERVATIVE FRIENDLY DISTRICTS THAT THE 10th EXTENDS TO HOUSTON WHILE THE 25th REACHES DALLAS 214 MILES AWAY. IN FACT, AUSTIN IS THE LARGEST CITY IN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT AN ANCHOR DISTRICT. AND THEN IT DAWNED ON ME, WHAT MAKES AUSTIN WEIRD ISN'T THE TOP HATS AND PENNY FARTHING BIKES, IT'S SOMETHING EVEN WEIRDER. OH, MY GOD! YOU AUSTINITES -- THAT'S WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT AUSTIN, OKAY? YOU SEEM TO BE SO PROGRESSIVE BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES ARE STAUNCH REPUBLICANS. YOU ALMOST HAD ME FOOLED INTO THINKING IT'S REALLY TOTALLY PROGRESSIVE HERE. BUT IT'S -- RRRRRRRR I'M NEVER GOING TO BE COOL! GOD, YOU GOT ME. YOU GUYS ARE SO COOL! YOU GUYS ARE SO COUNTERCULTURE! I CAN'T EVEN KEEP UP.
THAT IS PRETTY WEIRD BUT NOT WEIRD IN THE WAY THAT I LIKE.
YES, EXACTLY! REDISTRICTING WON'T TAKE PLACE HERE FOR ANOTHER EIGHT YEARS. SO UNTIL THEN, AUSTINITES ARE (BLEEP) WITH REPRESENTATION THAT DOESN'T REPRESENT THEM. OH MY GOD, AUSTIN, KEEPING IT RED. THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE DISTRICT 21!
Jon: SAMANTHA, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
