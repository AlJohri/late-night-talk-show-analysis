NO YOU. NO YOU. I START OFF OBVIOUSLY WITH MY TRADITIONAL GREETING TO YOU. YOU LOOK LIKE (bleep). [LAUGHTER]
THANK YOU. YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.
Jon: THANK YOU.
CAN I JUST SAY I WAS BACKSTAGE AND I WATCHED THAT JASON JONES DANCE.
Jon: WASN'T THAT NICE? IT WAS THE MOST VIOLENT THING I'VE EVER SEEN.
Jon: IT'S LIKE FRED ASTAIRE WAS PUT IN A BLENDER.
IT WAS. IT ACTUALLY. I'VE SEEN VIOLENCE. I'VE BEEN TO THE SUDAN.  I'VE SEEN SOME HORRIBLE THINGS. I CAN'T GET THIS OUT OF THE BACK OF MY EYES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU, IF I MAY.
YES.
Jon: YOU'RE WELCOME. >>George: THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT WAS-- CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? CAUSE WE WATCH ALL THESE IN THE EDITS ALL THE TIME. I WATCHED THAT MAYBE 25 TIMES. I STILL LAUGH MY ASS OFF EVERY TIME I SEE IT.
IT WAS SO GREAT. EVEN THE SONG WAS GREAT.
Jon: SONG WAS GREAT, EVERYTHING. AND WHEN HE WENT FOR THE MOVE, WITH EVERYTHING GOING.
IN YELLOWISH PANTS.
Jon: HE IS STILL, BY THE WAY, IN THE HOSPITAL. [ LAUGHTER ] TWO TORN HIPS, DISPLACED ELBOWS. WE'RE NOT THE YOUNG TROUPE WE USED TO BE.
NO, NO. IN FACT THOSE PANTS WEREN'T YELLOW WHEN THEY STARTED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SEPIA TONE, NOW. WE CALL IT SEPIA TONE. MONUMENTS MEN, JUST VERY BRIEFLY. SO THIS IS A STORY OF ART HISTORIANS?
HERE IS THE THING. APPARENTLY HITLER WAS A PRETTY BAD GUY. [LAUGHTER] AND ON TOP OF KILLING EVERYONE HE ALSO DECIDED THAT HE WOULD STEAL ALL THE ART IN ALL OF  EUROPE.
Jon: JUST TO GO SUPER VILLAIN ON THEM.
JUST TO REALLY TO MAKE SURE HE WAS A SCHMUCK.
Jon: RIGHT.
BASICALLY HE WAS STEALING, HE STOLE SIX MILLION PIECES OF ART, SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES OF ART IN OUR HISTORY AND WAS BUILDING A GIANT MUSEUM TO PUT IT IN AND HIDING IT IN SALT MINES ALL ACROSS AUSTRIA. BUT HE WAS ALSO DESTROYING-- HE BURNED A LOT OF PICCASSOS AND SALVADOR DALI'S BECAUSE HE CALLED IT DEGENERATE ART. HE WAS TRYING TO END THE CULTURE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT HE'D ALREADY KILLED. HE WAS JUST TRYING TO JUST SAY, THEY JUST DIDN'T EXIST. YOU DIDN'T EXIST. THAT WAS WHY THESE MEN WERE BROUGHT ON BOARD.
Jon: SO THIS ALSO WAS A SYSTEMIZED --
HE STARTED BACK IN THE LATE 30s GOING INTO -- SENDING GUYS TO FRANCE SAYING WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR MUSEUM AND THEN WOULD REGISTER ALL OF THE ART FROM ALL OF THE MUSEUMS IN FRANCE.
Jon: DID HAVE IT SOMETHING TO DO WITH -- THAT HE WAS ULTIMATELY A FAILED ARTIST? THAT HE WAS A PAINTER THAT NEVER GOT HIS DUE, AND THIS WHOLE THING COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF PEOPLE WERE JUST LIKE "NO, I LIKE IT." [LAUGHTER] THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET.  NICE JOB.
THERE WAS LITERALLY -- I THINK THERE WERE THREE ARTISTS TRYING TO GET INTO THIS AUSTRIAN ART SCHOOL AND TWO OF THEM GOT IN AND HITLER DIDN'T. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF HE'D GOTTEN INTO ART SCHOOL. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HIS GRADES WERE PROBABLY GOOD. I'M SURE IT WAS THE INTERVIEW. [LAUGHTER]
IT'S JUST THAT WHOLE LOOK.
Jon: HE WENT IN THERE, AND THEY WERE LIKE, WHAT KIND OF ART IS THAT?  AND HE WAS LIKE STILL LIFE!  YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE, ALL RIGHT I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE. YOU'RE  A NUT. [LAUGHTER]
STILL LIFE. I LIKE STILL LIFE.
Jon: STILL LIFE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
Jon: THIS IS TRUE. THIS GROUP OF ART PROFESSORS WENT IN AND --
AND THEY WERE ALL LET'S SAY NOT SPRING CHICKENS.
Jon: NO. ONE OF THEM IS STILL ALIVE, YES?
YES HE WAS. LAST NIGHT WE DID THE PREMIERE, AND HARRY ETTLINGER, WHO IS 90 SOMETHING, WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST MONUMENTS MAN AT THE TIME  WE GOT TO INTRODUCE HIM, AND IT WAS REALLY EMOTIONAL A REALLY FUN NIGHT LAST NIGHT. OH THAT'S EXCITING.
Jon: DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH HIM AFTERWARDS, DID HE SAY LIKE--
I DON'T TALK TO HIM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: NO YOU'RE A BIG STAR. I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GOING TO TALK TO HIM.
I WAS BUSY. MATT DAMON. THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE THERE TO TALK TO [ LAUGHTER ] NO I UNDERSTAND THAT. NO, IT'S YOU AND DAMON AND BIEBER IN THE V.I.P. ROOM, AND THIS GUY'S...
BIEBER, BY THE WAY, SUCKING ON EVERYBODY'S BREAST. [LAUGHTER[
Jon: DID YOU SEE THAT PICTURE?
I DID. I WAS -- AH, OFFENDED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BUT LISTEN, THE MONUMENTS MEN, ONCE AGAIN  I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU FIND THE TIME, WRITE, DIRECT, PRODUCE, ACT. YOU DID THIS. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.  WHEN IS IT?  THIS FRIDAY?
COMES OUT FRIDAY, IF IT DOESN'T SNOW US ALL TO DEATH. WHAT IS GOING ON?
Jon: WE ELECTED A COMMUNIST AND GOD HAS DECIDED TO PUNISH US. THIS IS A PURE WRATH SITUATION. SO I APOLOGIZE.
THAT'S OKAY. I TAKE IT.
Jon: MONUMENTS MEN IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY HERE. GEORGE CLOONEY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
