WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT A SCHOLAR OF RELIGION AND AUTHOR HIS LATEST BOOK IS ZEALOT:  THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JESUS OF NAZARETH. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM REZA ASLAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
Jon: REZA I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR YOU ARE A MUSLIM.
SHHH.
Jon: WHY WOULD YOU WRITE A BOOK ON THE FOUNDER OF CHRISTIANITY?
THIS IS MY SECRET MUSLIM PLAN TO DESTROY CHRISTIANITY.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THIS YOU WENT ON FOX AND THE LADY WAS ASKING THE QUESTIONS AND I WAS LOOKING AT IT LIKE OH, MY GOD REZA IS GOING TO STRANGLE THIS PERSON.
I DID OKAY.
Jon: YOU DID WONDERFUL. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. THE BOOK IS SO GOOD.
THANK YOU. THE PERFECT CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR YOUR JEWISH FRIENDS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YES. THERE'S NOTHING WE LIKE BETTER AROUND THIS TIME OF YEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] NICE PICTURE OF HIM LOOKING JUDGMENTALLY AT US. NICE MENORAH. YEAH, HEY, ENJOY YOUR POTATO LATKES. [LAUGHTER] HOW ARE YOU DOING OTHERWISE? THESE ARE VERY EXCITING TIMES FOR IRAN.
ABSOLUTELY. THIS NUCLEAR DEAL HAS REALLY CHANGED THE ATMOSPHERE IN IRAN. SO MUCH EXCITEMENT OVER IT. FRANKLY, A LITTLE TOO MUCH EXCITEMENT OVER IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY THAT BIG OF A  DEAL IN SO FAR AS SANCTIONS AND RELIEF AND HELPING THE ECONOMY. WHEREAS IN THE UNITED STATES NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THIS DEAL AS POSSIBLY LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR FUTURE NORMALIZATION, THAT'S ALL THEY TALK ABOUT IN IRAN. IT'S CREATED TWO CAMPS. A RECONCILIATION CAMP AND ISOLATIONIST CAMP. THE RECONCILIATION CAMP HAS ALL THE MOMENTUM. THE ISOLATIONISTS ARE STILL THERE, MUTED, WAITING FOR THIS THING TO COLLAPSE SO THEY CAN ATTACK THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. FRANKLY THE CONGRESS MIGHT GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY.
Jon: HOW MUCH POWER DOES ROUHANI HAVE. WE SAW THE EIGHT YEARS OF AHMEDINEJAD. WE SAW THE GREEN AHMREVOLUTION WHERE MOUSAVIEN APPEARED TO HAVE DEFEATED AHMEDINEJAD ELECTORALLY. THERE WAS TREMENDOUS PROTEST IN THE STREETS, TREMENDOUS VIOLENCE. THIS MOVEMENT IS SORT OF DRIVEN UNDERGROUND. ROUHANI IS CONSIDERED IN THAT MOUSAVI CAMP, YES? MORE OF A REFORMIST?
HE IS A MODERATE.
Jon: DOES HE HAVE ANY POWER OR DOES IT REST WITH THE SUPREME LEADER AND IF HE SAYS HE IS IN THE ISOLATIONIST CAMP ARE THEY IN THE ISOLATIONIST CAMP?
YES. THE ONLY POWER THAT REALLY MATTERS IS THE SUPREME LEADER'S VOICE BUT IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT. THERE'S A ROBUST CIVIC INFRASTRUCTURE IN IRAN AND THE PRESIDENT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES. WHAT HE HAS GOING FOR HIM IS SO FAR THE SUPREME LEADER IS SUPPORTING THIS. THAT'S WHY THE RECONCILIATION CAMP HAS THIS GREAT MOMENTUM ON ITS SIDE AND WHY THE ISOLATIONISTS ARE KEEPING FOR THE MOST PART QUIET BECAUSE IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE DEAL YOU ARE DISAGREEING WITH THE SUPREME LEADER. THE ISSUE AGAIN AND I HATE TO BRING THIS UP RESTS WITH THE U.S. CONGRESS.
Jon: I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO JEWS AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT THAT'S WHERE WE WERE GOING HERE AND I WAS GOING TO ONCE AGAIN SAY WE'RE QUITE PLEASANT WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW US. [LAUGHTER]
THIS IS THE PROBLEM, YOU KNOW SHALL EVERYBODY IN THE U.S. KEEPS TALKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE TRUST IRAN TO HOLD UP ITS END OF THE BARGAIN. THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.
Jon: BECAUSE IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE AN ISOLATIONIST CAMP. IT'S SIMILAR. YOU ARE PLAYING TO A VERY PARTICULAR MUCH MORE RIGID BASE HERE THAT WON'T ALLOW -- YOU SAW THE KERFUFFLE THAT OCCURRED WHEN OBAMA JUST SHOOK RAUL CASTRO'S HAND. LET ALONE TRYING TO FORGE SOME KIND OF WAY FORWARD WITH IRAN.
FAR BE IT FOR ME TO SUGGEST THAT CONGRESS IS FULL OF PETTY CHILDREN PRESIDING OVER A CESSPOOL OF WASTED SPACE.
Jon: SO YOU DO WATCH OUR SHOW. YOU DO WATCH!
YES. YOU CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO SCUTTLE THIS DEAL. THE NEGOTIATION IS PRETTY CLEAR IN EXCHANGE FOR IRAN FREEZING AND ROLLING BACK THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM, WHICH THEY'VE DONE, WE'LL RELEASE A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR FROZEN ASSETS AND PROMISE NOT TO ENGAGE IN ANY NEW SANCTIONS. THIS BILL THAT CONGRESS IS TRYING TO PASS TO CREATE NEW SANCTIONS IS A VIOLATION OF THE AGREEMENT. THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF IRAN, A PRETTY WESTERN FRIENDLY MODERATE PREGUY HAS SAID IF THIS THINGATE PASSES IT'S THE END OF THE DEAL. IT'S A DEAL BREAKER. YOU CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THIS CONGRESS IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS INTERESTED IN THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY THAN IN THEIR OWN POLITICAL GOOD. THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO  MISOULA, MONTANA AND TELL THE 3,000 PEOPLE THAT VOTED THEM INTO OFFICE THAT THEY WERE TOUGH ON IRAN AND A FRIEND TO ISRAEL. IT WILL GET THEM REELECTED TO TWO MORE YEARS OF A FAIRLY CUSHY JOB TO GET PAID TO DO NOTHING. BUT IT'S A DANGER TO THE COUNTRY.
Jon: WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THERE ARE CERTAIN ABSOLUTE BOOGIEMEN THAT ARE OUT THERE, THE UNITED NATIONS, IRAN. AND NOT FOR NO REASON THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS IRAN IS DOING. THEY ARE BAD ACTORS IN CERTAIN FIELDS OF PLAY AND ALL THAT.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: IF WE DON'T ENGAGE THESE COUNTRIES AND BUILD MORE PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIPS I THINK WE'RE BEGINNING TO LEARN THAT PURE SANCTIONS DRIVEN CONSEQUENCES OR INVADING THEM AND TRYING TO HOLD THE TERRITORY UNTIL A GOVERNMENT ARISES THAT LIKES US IS NOT MAYBE THE ANSWER.
WHAT CRACKS ME UP WAS THAT IF SANCTIONS WERE A WAY TO GET IRAN TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. SANCTIONING THEM IS A PUNISHMENT FOR COMING TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE? THE SANCTIONS WORKED BECAUSE THEY WERE INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS. THEY WORKED BECAUSE WE GOT THE EUROPEANS AND RUSSIA AND EVEN CHINA TO GO ALONG WITH THEM. IF THIS SANCTIONS LAW PASSES IN CONGRESS IT'S AS CLEAR A MESSAGE TO OUR ALLIES THAT THIS IS ALL A JOKE FOR US AND WE'RE NOT SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. THE ENTIRE SANCTIONS REGIME WILL FALL APART AND IRAN WILL CONTINUE TO ENRICH URANIUM TO ITS HEART CONTENT.
Jon: AND THEY'LL ERODE IT ANYWAY. STICK AROUND?
SURE.
Jon: ZEALOT IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. REZA ASLAN.
