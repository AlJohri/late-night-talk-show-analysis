FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK.  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WHAT'S UP MAN? I'M BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS... WHAT IS MY GUEST TONIGHT IS SLATE'S SUPREME COURT EXPERT DAHLIA LITHWICK. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. WE'RE BACK. WE'RE BACK FROM BREAK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] TWO WEEKS OF SUN, FUN AND STEALING TROPICAL BIRDS FROM WHAT I THINK, IF THE SIGN IS TO BE BELIEVED, A PROTECTED, ENDANGERED SPECIES SANCTUARY, ALTHOUGH NOT THAT PROTECTED IF A GUY WITH A CASE OF SPICED RUM AND A SWISS ARMY KNIFE CAN BREECH THE PERIMETER. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? RIGHT?  THERE... THAT'S MR. WHISKERS. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BIRDS. [LAUGHTER] TRUTH IS UNTIL I SOBERED UP, I THOUGHT HE WAS A LEMUR. BUT UM, POINT IS THIS: MAN, GOOD BREAK. I TUNED OUT. I CHILLED OUT. WHAT AM I GOING TO MISS IN A TWO-WEEK PERIOD, RIGHT? IT'S THE SUMMER.
CRISIS ON OUR BOARDER. THE IMMIGRATION NIGHTMARE.
THE SPY SCANDAL EXPLODES.
CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
REPUBLICANS JUST ANNOUNCING PLANS TO SUE THE PRESIDENT.
TOXIC BOMBSHELL.
TROPICAL STORM WATCHES FOR THE EAST COAST.
TERRORISTS WITH NUCLEAR MATERIAL.
STANDING ON THE BRINK OF ALL-OUT WAR. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: 'TWAS THE NEWS THAT [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: 'TWAS THE NEWS THAT KILLED WHISKERS, OR THE FACT THAT I'D ONLY FED HIM SMOKED DELI MEAT FOR ABOUT A WEEK. WHAT HAPPENED? WE WERE GONE FOR TWO WEEKS. LET'S JUST, LET'S DEAL WITH AMERICA FIRST.
THIS HUGE IMMIGRATION CRISIS.
60,000 TO 80,000 CHILDREN WITHOUT PARENTS EXPECTED TO CROSS ILLEGALLY THIS YEAR.
OVERWHELMING U.S. FACILITIES.
THERE AREN'T ENOUGH BEDS, BATHROOMS OR FOOD.
Jon: YOU GOT TO BLAME OBAMA'S IMMIGRATION POLICY FOR THIS ONE. YOU DON'T WANT MIGRANT CHILDREN, YOU DON'T PUT UP THESE BILLBOARDS. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] OR A BORDER-LENGTH BALL PIT. IT'S NOT SMART. IT'S NOT A START MOVE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THESE CHILDREN... THESE CHILDREN ARE FLEEING TERRIBLE CRIME AND VIOLENCE IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES, SEEKING EMBRACE IN THE OPEN AND CARING ARMS OF MOTHER AMERICA. GIVE ME YOUR TIRED, YOUR POOR, YOUR HUDDLED MASSES YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE.
GO BACK TO MEXICO!
YEAH, GET OUT OF HERE! [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OKAY. THAT WASN'T THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. AND TECHNICALLY ACTUALLY MANY ARE FROM CENTRAL AMERICA, YOUR HONDURAS, YOUR EL SALVADOR AND, OF COURSE, AS JESUS SAID, I WAS A STRANGER AND YOU WELCOMED ME.
JESUS WOULD NOT BREAK THE LAW. [LAUGHTER] [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: YOU MEAN RADICAL DESTROYER OF THE STATUS QUO JESUS? BARGING INTO TEMPLES, OVERTHROWING TABLES JESUS? BREAKING THE LAW WAS KIND OF HIS THING. IN FACT, HE DIDN'T JUST WALK ON WATER, HE JAYWALKED ON WATER. THAT'S ACTUALLY... IF I KNOW MY BIBLICAL HISTORY, IS WHERE THE J IN JAYWALKING CAME FROM. JESUS-WALKING THEY CALLED IT. LOOK, IT'S A DIFFICULT HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. BUT IT AIN'T NORMANDY. YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT BORDER TROUBLES?
ISIS TERRORISTS CONTROL LARGE PARTS OF IRAQ AND SYRIA.
ISIS SEEM TO BE INCHING EVER CLOSER TO THE IRAQI CAPITAL.
Jon: ISIS, LED BY THIS AL-BAGHDADI GUY OVER THERE. HE'S KNOCKED OVER THE BIGGEST BANK IN MOSUL IN IRAQ, TAKEN OVER OIL FIELDS, HE'S BANK ROLLING HIMSELF AS THE LEADER OF A SORT OF NEW IN THE TIME OF MOHAMMAD FUNDAMENTALIST CALIPHATE. EVERYBODY IS WAITING FOR THIS DUDE TO SLIP UP, BUT HE HAS NOT.
THIS IMAGE APPEARS TO SHOW AL-BAGHDADI WEARING A $7,000 ROLEX OR OMEGA TIME PIECE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OKAY. THAT'S KIND OF A [BLEEPED] UP. THAT... ALTHOUGH, IN HIS DEFENSE, YOU KNOW, WHENEVER YOU'RE TAKING YOUR FOLLOWERS THAT FAR BACK IN TIME, YOU WANT TO KEEP TRACK OF IT IN STYLE. OF COURSE, WHILE ISIS IS A NEW MIDDLE EAST CATASTROPHE. DON'T WORRY. THE AREA IS NOT PULLING CATASTROPHE CLASSIC OFF THE SHELVES JUST YET.
TONIGHT, ISRAELI TANKS ARE POSITIONED OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCES TO GAZA, AWAITING ORDERS TO INVADE AS THE AERIAL BOMBARDMENTS FROM BOTH SIDES CONTINUED.
Jon: TASTE GREAT, MORE KILLING. LOOK, BOTH SIDES ARE ENGAGING IN AERIAL BOMBARDMENT, BUT ONE SIDE APPEARS TO BE BOMB-BETTER AT IT. MOST HAMAS ROCKETS ARE NEUTRALIZED BY ISRAEL'S IRON DOME TECHNOLOGY, AND ISRAELI CITIZENS CAN EVEN NOW DOWNLOAD A WARNING APP.
YOU'LL GET IT ON YOUR PHONE AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT CITY IS BEING TARGETED AND WHEN IT'S BEING TARGETED.
Jon: WELL, THAT'S $2.99 VERSION. THE FREE VERSION, IN THE FREE VERSION, YOU HAVE TO WATCH A CLIP OF TRANSFORMERS 4 AND THEN IF YOU CAN GET IT OFF THE SCREEN, THEY'LL TELL YOU WHERE THE BOMB IS GOING. SO ISRAELIS SEEM TO HAVE A HIGH-TECH SMARTPHONE ALERT SYSTEM. HOW ARE THE GAZANS NOTIFIED?
BASICALLY A SMALL MORTAR EXPLOSION ON THE ROOF OF A BUILDING, WHICH SERVES AS AN ISRAELI WARNING OF AN UPCOMING AIR STRIKE.
Jon: HMMM. SO THE ISRAELI MILITARY WARNS GAZA RESIDENTS OF IMMINENT BOMBING WITH A SMALLER WARNING BOMBING. [LAUGHTER] AN AMUSED BOOM, IF YOU WILL. AND THEN AT THAT POINT, AT THAT POINT, WHAT ARE GAZANS SUPPOSED TO DO?
THE ISRAELI MILITARY TELEPHONED THEIR NEIGHBOR TO WARN THEM TO EVACUATE, BUT THEY ONLY HAD THREE MINUTES.
Jon: EVACUATE TO WHERE? HAVE YOU [BLEEPED] SEEN GAZA? IT'S THIS BIG! ISRAEL BLOCKED THIS BORDER. EGYPT BLOCKED THIS BORDER. WHAT, ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO SWIM FOR IT? PERHAPS NOTHING SUMS UP THE ASYMMETRICAL NATURE OF THIS CONFLICT MORE THAN A QUICK CHECK-IN WITH THE CORRESPONDENTS ASSIGNED TO THE RESPECTIVE BEATS.
TONIGHT WE HAVE A VIEW FROM THE GROUND ON BOTH SIDES STARTING WITH MARTIN FLETCHER IN TEL AVIV. [LAUGHTER] LOOK AT THIS! THE GAZA REPORTER LOOKS LIKE AN EXTRA FROM THE HURT LOCKER. WHILE THE REPORTER IN ISRAEL LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO BANG OUT HIS STAND-UP AND THEN HEAD TO A JIMMY BUFFETT CONCERT. THEY'RE A LIVING POLITICAL CARTOON FOR THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE WORLD HAS GONE MAD. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN SAVE US AT THIS POINT NOW, SCIENCE, MAYBE, RATIONAL, RELIABLE, FACTUAL, YOU'D NEVER LET US DOWN SCIENCE, WOULD YOU?
C.D.C. WORKERS LOST TRACK OF SAMPLES OF A DANGEROUS H5N1 INFLUENZA VIRUS.
MORE THAN 80 WORKERS AT THE C.D.C. IN ATLANTA WERE EXPOSED TO ANTHRAX.
THE C.D.C. IS INVESTIGATING HOW VILES OF THE SMALLPOX VIRUS TURNED UP IN A STORAGE LAB USED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: HAVE YOU GUYS EVER READ YOUR SIGN? CENTER FOR DISEASE "CONTROL." ARE YOU GUYS HAVING A MIDLIFE CRISIS? HAVE YOU BECOME BORED WITH YOUR MISSION OF CENTRALLY CONTROLLING DISEASE? MUCH LIKE A MIDDLE AGED MEN BUYS A SPORTS CARS, YOU'RE SPICING THINGS UP BY SEEING WHAT SPREADING DISEASE FEELS LIKE. I GO ON VACATION FOR TWO WEEKS. TWO WEEKS. YOU COME BACK TO FIND OUT THAT THINGS ARE SO [BLEEPED] UP IN OUR WORLD THAT THE TWO HAPPIEST PLACES ON EARTH RIGHT NOW ARE GERMANY AND CLEVELAND.
