Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS WE JUST SAW -- SORRY. AS WE JUST SAW BALANCING OUR NATION'S BUDGET AS WELL AS NUMEROUS PROPS SEEMS ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE. [LAUGHTER] FOR HELP FROM THAT WE TURN TO "THE DAILY SHOW" RESIDENT PROBLEM SOLVER JOHN HODGMAN AND  HIS SEGMENT "YOU'RE WELCOME." ♪ ♪
Jon: THANKS FOR JOINING US. THIS WEEK THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED ITS BUDGET [BUZZER]
HANG ON ONE SECOND.
Jon: WHAT IS THAT?
WATSON THE JEOPARDY COMPUTER. HE'S DOING MILLIONAIRE TONIGHT. I'M HIS PHONE A FRIEND. THIS WILL JUST TAKE A SECOND. YES, I'M HERE WATSON.
HODGMAN, I NEED YOUR HELP.
JUST RELAX AND TELL ME THE QUESTION.
QUEERY:  WHICH ACTOR PLAYED CAPTAIN STIEWBING ON LOVEBOAT. LOGICAL MAN CANNOT LOVE BOAT. EXTERMINATE.
NO EXTERMINATE, NO!
HODGE HODGMAN, YOU HAVE TO GET ME OUT OF THIS LIKE LAST TIME.
OKAY, OKAY. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. I SEEM TO HAVE LOST HIM. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: JOHN, CAN WE SPEED THIS UP. I HAVE TO BE AT THE ABC STUDIOS.
Jon: HO DO WE CUT THE STPWHUGT.
START WITH PUT KUTS TO THE PENTAGON.
Jon: PRESIDENT OBAMA PROPOSED $80 BILLION IN CUTS TO THE MILITARY. YOU ARE SAYING THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING THE PENTAGON. DO WE REALLY NEED A BUILDING WITH FIVE SIDES? [LAUGHTER] IN THIS ECONOMY ISN'T THAT EXTRAVAGANT.
Jon: YOU ARE SUGGESTING WEG CHANGE THE PENTAGON TO A RECTANGLE.
WHAT ARE WE PORTUGAL? NO. A RHOBUS THE MOST MENACING, OUR ENEMIES MUST KNOW WE'RE SERIOUS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: CUTTING COST IS JUST ONCE OUT OF EQUATION, JOHN. THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO RAISE REVENUE. IF HE WE GOT RID OF BUSH TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP 40% THAT'S $40 BILLION RIGHT THERE.
WE CANNOT RAISE TAXES. HARD-WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY GIVE ENOUGH OF THEIR PAYCHECK TO THE GOVERNMENT. AND FOR WHAT SO NASA CAN BUY A TOILET SEAT FOR $10 MILLION. WHEN I COMES TO SPENDING OUR MONEY, I PUT MY TRUST IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE [CASH REGISTER]
Jon: WHAT IS THAT SOUND?
IT'S A KA-CHING, JON. A TAX ON ANTITAX CLEE SHAYS. WE CAN TAX THE BUMPER STICKERS ABOUT TAXES. YOU TRY ONE.
Jon: YOU CAN KEEP YOUR HOPE, I'LL KEEP THE CHANGE  [CHA-CHING SOUND]
GOOD ONCE.
Jon: RONALD REAGAN --  [CHA-CHING] THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY REAGAN?
YOU PROBABLY COULD HAVE GONE IT WITH RONALD RE --
Jon: THAT FILLS THE NATION'S COFFERS.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO? LEGALIZE IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. LEGALIZING MURDER. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A PRETTY HIP CROWD, JON.
Jon: YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT LEGALIZING MURDER?
MURDER. ALL I'M SAYING IS LET'S PUT THE FREE MARKET DARINNAN THEORIES TO THE TEST. LET THE WEAK PERSONNISH AND LET THE STRONG TAKE THEIR WIVES SO LONG AS THEY CAN PAY THE BIGAMY TAX.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE?
THAT'S HALF OUR BUDGET RIGHT THERE. DEDICATED TO TAKING CARE OF THE OLDIES AND SICKIES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE YOUNGIES AND  SEXYIES LIKE US. MORE LIKE US. SORRY. POINT IS, IT'S NOT FAIR.
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING GET RID OF THE OLD AND INFIRMED, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE --
NO, NO, DON'T GET RID OF THEM. LET'S MAKE SOCIAL SECURITY FUN. WE'LL MAKE IT A COMPETITION. WINNER TAKE ALL.
Jon: YOU DON'T MEAN?
YES, JON, A GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE LAST LIVING PARTICIPANT COLLECTS ALL  OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY.
Jon: IF MURDER IS LEGAL THAT INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO KILL EACH OTHER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SORRY, JON, WHAT WERE YOU SAYING.
Jon: THAT INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO KILL EACH OTHER TO WIN THE POT.
DON'T BE SILLY, JON, DON'T BE SILLY AT ALL P. COME HERE, WATSON, I NEED YOU.
EXTERMINATE!
