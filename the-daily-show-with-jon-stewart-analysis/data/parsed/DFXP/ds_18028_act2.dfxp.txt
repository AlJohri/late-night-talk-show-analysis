(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE  C.E.O. OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY,  SHE IS THE SENIOR EDITOR AT LARGE OF "FORTUNE" MAGAZINE AS  WELL AS AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK  "TAP DANCING TO WORK: WARREN BUFFETT ON PRACTICALLY  EVERYTHING, 1966 TO 2012."  PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM WARREN BUFFETT AND CAROL LOOMIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NICE TO SEE YOU, SIR. NICE TO SEE YOU. (APPLAUSE)  HOW ARE YOU?
NEVER BETTER. NEVER BETTER.
Jon: GREAT TO SEE YOU GUYS. THE BOOK IS CALLED "TAP DANCING  TO WORK."  TELL ME ABOUT THIS COLLABORATION  FIRST OF ALL. YOU ARE A VERY RENOWN AND  WELL-RESPECTED FINANCIAL WRITER. YOU RUN --
LET'S NOT GET INTO IT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW DID THIS COME TO  BE?
HOW DID THE BOOK COME TO BE? >
Jon: YES.
WELL I GOT THE IDEA WHEN WE  HAD BEEN COVERING WARREN FOR 40  YEARS. I THOUGHT WE OUGHT TO PULL ALL  THIS TOGETHER. BECAUSE WE'D HAD A GREAT  COLLECTION OF STORIES, MANY OF  THEM WRITTEN BY OTHER WRITERS, NOT ME AT ALL, AND I THOUGHT WE  SHOULD DO IT AND THEN IT ONLY  TOOK ME SIX YEARS TO GET IT  DONE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: NOW, ARE YOU A FONT OF  WISDOM TO SOME EXTENT? IS THAT -- WERE YOU AWARE THAT  SOMEONE WAS COLLECTING YOUR  THOUGHTS FROM 1966 ON UNTIL NOW?
I'VE HAD VERY FEW SINCE THEN,  ACTUALLY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT CAROL'S BEEN AN OBSERVER FOR  A LONG TIME. WE TALK ALMOST EVERYDAY AND SHE  KNOWS MORE ABOUT ME THAN SHE PUT  IN THE BOOK.
THAT'S FOR VOLUME TWO.
Jon: OH, VOLUME TWO, I LIKE  THIS. MORE SALACIOUS, HUH? (LAUGHTER)  NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE. OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE BEEN AT THE  FOREFRONT OF THE NEWS LATELY  BECAUSE OF THIS ARGUMENT THAT WE'RE HAVING IN THIS COUNTRY NOW  ABOUT TAXATION, HOW TO FUND THE  GOVERNMENT WHILE DEALING WITH THE DEFICIT. YOU HAVE SUGGESTED SOMETHING  WHICH COINCIDENTALLY IS CALLED  THE BUFFETT RULE WHICH I THINK, LIKE LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE IS  VERY UNBELIEVABLE THAT THIS RULE  WOULD JUST HAPPEN TO BE PROMOTED BY --
THE DISEASES WERE ALREADY  TAKEN. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)
Jon: I ASSUME BUFFERIN HAS  SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. YOU HAVE COME OUT AND SAID YOU  WOULD PREFER SOMETHING WHERE THE  RICH PAY A FLAT -- AT LEAST 30%. ON THEIR MONEY. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
WELL, IF THEY MAKE OVER A  MILLION, I SAY ON THE AMOUNT  OVER A MILLION THEY OUGHT TO PAY AT LEAST 30% AND OVER $10  MILLION THEY OUGHT TO PAY 35%. MOST OF THE PEOPLE -- IN FACT,  VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN  MY OFFICE, 20 OR SO PEOPLE, BETWEEN PAYROLL AND INCOME TAXES  THEY PAY MORE THAN 30%. A NUMBER OF THE EXTREMELY  WEALTHY PEOPLE PAY LESS THAN 15%  AND SOME PAY LESS THAN 10% AND SOME PAY NOTHING.
Jon: THIS IS BECAUSE OF  CAPITAL GAINS AND THE CAYMAN  ISLANDS.
THE WHOLE WORKS.
Jon: AND BAGS THAT ARE KEPT  DANGLING. (LAUGHTER)
YOU'RE GETTING WARM.
Jon: EXACTLY. WHAT THEN ABOUT THE ARGUMENT  WHERE THEY SAY THAT'S DOUBLE  TAXATION IF YOU DO CAPITAL GAINS AND THAT WILL HURT INVESTMENT. THIS IS CLEARLY SOMETHING YOU  ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH AT THE  MAGAZINE.
WELL, WE HOPE SO, DOUBLE  TAXATION.
Jon: BUT IS THAT A VALID --
WELL, IF SOMEBODY OUT THERE  IS MAKING $70,000 A YEAR AT  WHATEVER THEIR JOB THEY'RE PAYING INCOME TAX AND PAYROLL  TAXES. THEY'RE GETTING TAXED TWICE,  TOO. AND IN MY OWN CASE I PAID A VERY  LOW RATE IN 2009 WHICH I WROTE  ABOUT. PRACTICALLY ALL MY CAPITAL GAINS  CAME FROM BOND, THERE WAS NO  DOUBLE TAXATION THERE.
Jon: THEY'RE SAYING THAT  UNLESS THE RICH CAN PAY LESS  THEY WON'T INVEST IN COMPANIES AND AMERICA. THAT THE JOB CREATORS MUST BE --  AND WE SHOULD ALSO GET THEM -- I  GUESS IT'S CALLED FEATHER BEDS. (LAUGHTER)
I'LL DO THIS. I'LL CALL YOU AT 1:00 TONIGHT  AND I WILL TELL YOU, "JON, I'VE  GOT THE BEST IDEA I'VE EVER HAD, I'M GOING TO PUT EVERY PENNY  I'VE GOT IN IT. DO YOU WANT TO COME ALONG."  WILL YOU SAY "HOW MUCH TAX DO I  HAVE TO PAY BEFORE I MAKE A FORTUNE?"
Jon: I THINK THE FIRST  THING I WOULD SAY IS "WHY ARE  YOU CALLING ME AT 1:00 A.M.? WHAT'S GOING ON WARREN?"  (LAUGHTER)  I WOULD SAY "WARREN, WHAT'S THIS  REALLY ABOUT?" (LAUGHTER)  HERE'S WHAT'S BEEN FASCINATING  ME. SORT OF NOW THE TRADITIONAL  CONSERVATIVE ARGUMENT IS WE MUST  HAVE LOW TAXES OR THE ECONOMY WON'T FLOURISH, BUT I GUESS IN  MY MIND I THINK OF TRADITIONAL  ECONOMY BEING THE POST-NEW DEAL ECONOMY OF RELATIVELY ROBUST  HIGH TAX RATES ON HIGH EARNERS  AND A SOCIAL SAFETY NET THAT IS PART OF THE SOCIAL COMPACT. TO ME THAT'S TRADITION. THAT'S 80 YEARS.
THAT'S AMERICAN. AND I'VE -- YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN  WORKING AT INVESTMENTS -- WELL,  REALLY I BOUGHT MY FIRST STOCK WHEN I WAS 11 BUT I STARTED  SELLING STOCKS WHEN I WAS 20 AND  I SOLD STOCKS WHEN PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATES GOT AS HIGH AS  91%. I'VE SOLD THEM WHEN CAPITAL  GAINS RATE GOT AS HIGH AS 39.6%  AND WE HAD SOME WONDERFUL PERIODS OF GROWTH AND G.D.P. AND THE MIDDLE-CLASS AS WELL AS  THE RICH PROSPERED WHEN TAX  RATES WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN THEY ARE NOW.
Jon: WELL, WE'LL TAKE A  COMMERCIAL AND COME BACK AND  TALK ABOUT AN OP-ED THAT YOU WROTE WHICH LAID OUT SOME OF THE  MATH OF THIS AND SOME OTHER  FINANCIAL GOING ON IN THE WORLD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. MORE FROM WARREN BUFFETT AND  CAROL LOOMIS RIGHT AFTER THIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
