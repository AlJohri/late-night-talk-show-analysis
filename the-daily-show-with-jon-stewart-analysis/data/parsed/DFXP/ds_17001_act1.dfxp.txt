OCTOBER 3, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. I HOPE YOUR DVR-ING THIS. OUR GUEST THE THOMAS FRIEDMAN TALKING ABOUT HIS NEWS BOOK, "THAT USED TO BE US. I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE HINT. I WON'T GIVE AWAY HOW IT ENDS BUT IT INVOLVES SELLING THE MOON. FIRST MORE BIG NEWS IN AMERICA'S WAR ON TERROR.
ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST WANTEDED TERRORISTS IS DEAD. ANWAR AL AWLAKI WAS BORN AMERICAN.
THIS WAS A C.I.A.-LED OPERATION.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE CAPTURE OR KILL ORDER.
TWO PREDATOR DRONES TOOK OUT AL AWLAKI.
Jon: YES, WE... WAIT! WHO? THAT'S ONE... WHO IS IS THIS GUY?
A 40-YEAR-OLD WAS KNOWN AS THE BIN LADEN OF THE INTERNET. FOR HIS USE OF YOU-TUBE TO RECRUIT WANT A BE TERRORISTS. IN FACT, LAST YEAR YOU-TUBE REMOVED SEVERAL CLIPS OF AWLAKI.
Jon: THAT'S OKAY. THEY DID REMOVE AWLAKI'S CLIPS BUT NOT BECAUSE OF TERRORISM. WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENED WAS AWLAKI TRIED TO POST VIDEOS OF OUR SHOW ON YOU-TUBE. YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY BUT YOU DON'T (BEEP) WITH VIA COME BECAUSE THEY WILL RAIN HELL  FIRE DOWN ON YOU. THEY ARE... OH, SO THERE'S GOT TO BE A SILLYIER WAY TO BOIL DOWN AWLAKI'S EVIL.
HE WAS KIND OF LIKE THE FACEBOOK FRIEND FROM HELL.
Jon: YOU KNOW, THOSE KIND THAT WHENEVER YOU WOULD SAY A FAMILY MEMBER HAD PASSED AWAY  HE'D LIKE CLICK LIKE. HE'D POKE YOUR WALL WITH FARMVILLE, UPDATE SPITTOON, MONKEYS. I DON'T KNOW. MY WRITERS TELL ME THOSE ARE FACEBOOK TERMS. I DON'T KNOW. STILL ON COMPUSERVE. YOU KNOW, IF HE TOLD ME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY THAT HIS CLEAREST  LEGACY WOULD INVOLVE NOT CLOSING GITMO OR GREEN JOBS OR MANUFACTURING JOBS OR ANY KIND  OF JOBS REALLY, BUT WOULD IN FACT BE HIS ABILITY TO RAIN TARGETED DEATH FROM THE SKY, I  MEAN, ARE WE EVEN ALLOWED TO DO THAT?
YES... WE... CAN.
Jon: OH. I WAS JUST ASKING. WOW. I HAD NO IDEA HOW VERSATILE THAT SLOGAN WAS. TURNING NOW TO THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE. TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY ENTERED THE CONTEST WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FANFARE AND  IMMEDIATELY SHOT TO THE TOP OF THE FIELD. AND THEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK.
IS IT THE MITT ROMNEY THAT WAS ON THE SIDE OF AGAINST THE SECOND AMENDMENT BEFORE HE WAS  FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT? WAS IT BEFORE HE WAS BEFORE THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS?
Jon: YOU KNOW, WATCHING GOVERNOR PERRY DO THAT, YOU REALLY DO PICTURE SORT OF A  SQUADRON OF TINY LITTLE MEN INSIDE HIS HEAD RUNNING AROUND FRANTICALLY TRYING TO FIND THE  RIGHT PAPER, YOU KNOW AND THEN ONE OF THEM KNOCKS OVER THE COFFEE ON THE CONTROL PANEL. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE CAN RECOVER FROM POOR DEBATE PERFORMANCE NOT LIKE THOSE WORDS ARE  WRITTEN IN STONE WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR NEXT RICK PERRY STORY.
A TROUBLING STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE "WASHINGTON  POST" TODAY ABOUT RICK PERRY. THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS. IT INDICATES THAT FOR YEARS HIS FAMILY HAD A HUNTING CAMP IN WEST TEXAS AND THE NAME OF  IT WRITTEN ON A STONE WAS N- HEAD. OBVIOUSLY IT WASN'T JUST N-HEAD.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FOR? I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT. YOU SAY IT.
I KNOW THAT YOU WILL REFRAIN FROM SAYING THAT WORD SO I'M GOING TO SAY WHAT THE  WORD WAS ON THE ROCK. THE NAME OF THE PLACE WAS CALLED NIGGER HEAD.
Jon: REALLY? LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT OUR AUDIENCE WILL (BEEP) ANYTHING. ALL RIGHT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I'M JUST GOING TO GO WITH THAT  WAS A SHOCK WHOOP. THANK YOU, HERMAN CAIN. BOY, IF YOU EVER NEED ANYBODY TO SAY ANYTHING OFFENSIVE IN JEWISH TERMS, CALL ME. WAIT. HOW DID WE JUST FIND OUT ABOUT THIS NOW? RICK PERRY HAS BEEN GOVERNOR OF TEXAS FOR 11 YEARS. HOW COME HE DIDN'T HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS FAMILY RANCH STONE BEFORE? OH, I'M BEING TOLD HE DOES ADDRESS IT IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY. (LAUGHING) NOW THAT YOU CAN WHOOP AT. THIS IS CRAZY. I'M NOT SAYING RICK PERRY WAS GOING TO WIN... (LAUGHING) I'M NOT SAYING RICK PERRY WAS  GOING TO WIN THE AFRICAN- AMERICAN VOTE ANYWAY BUT PERRY BETTER HAVE A GOOD EXPLANATION FOR THIS.
PERRY SAYS HIS FATHER PAINTED OVER THE SIGN SOON AFTER LEASING THE PROPERTY IN 1983.
Jon: SURELY THAT AREA MIGHT HAVE A PAINTING COMPANY SOLELY TASKED WITH CORRECTING THESE OVERSIGHTS. FOR MORE ON THIS STORY WE GOT TO WYATT CENAC COMING TO US LIVE FROM TEXAS. ( APPLAUSE ) WYATT, I KNOW YOU GREW UP IN TEXAS. IT'S GOT TO BE HEARTFUL AND HURTFUL AND HURT YOUR HEART TO BE REMINDED OF THE CASUAL  RACIAL INSENSITIVITY THAT HAS LONG MARRED THAT STATE.
ACTUALLY, JON, I'M NOT IN TEXAS. I'M IN YOUR STATE. I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF NIGGER LAKE NEW YORK. WOOO! (LAUGHING)
Jon: SO THAT WAS YOU?
I LOVE IT.
Jon: I KNOW. YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NEW YORK. WE HAVE THAT IN.
IT'S REAL. UP HERE IN HAMILTON COUNTY. THE STATE EVEN LISTED IT ON ITS WEBSITE UNTIL RECENTLY. YOU CAN SEE WHY. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LAKE. UNLESS YOU'RE A NIGGER.
Jon: WOW. WYATT, I GUESS IT TAKES A WHILE FOR NAME CHANGES TO GO THROUGH.
HOW LONG DO YOU NEED? YOU CAN CALL IT ANYTHING. CAT (BEEP) LAKE. FART SWALLOW LAKE. TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES LAKE. OR HOW ABOUT (BEEP) OVER THERE? I MEAN, THE POINT IS EVERYBODY IS RUSHING TO CONDEMN TEXAS. SURE, THERE'S A LOT OF RACIST (BEEP) THAT GOES ON IN TEXAS. BUT GUESS WHAT. THERE'S NIGGER HEAD RAPIDS IDAHO. NIGGER HEAD POINT FLORIDA. NIGGER HEAD POND VERMONT. NIGGER HEAD CREEK NORTH CAROLINA, GOOD FISHING. DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE OVER 100 PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN CALLED NIGGER HEAD IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE WAS EVEN A NIGGER HEAD POINT IN NEW YORK. IT'S OVER IN WAYNE COUNTY ON LAKE ONTARIO BUT OUT OF RESPECT THEY CHANGED IT TO  NEGRO HEAD POINT.
Jon: WOW, THAT'S....
THEN THEY REALIZED THAT STILL WASN'T VERY RESPECTFUL SO NOW THEY JUST CALL IT  GRAVE'S POINT.
Jon: GRAVES? WHO DOES THAT REFER TO?
I DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY SOME NIGGER NAMED GRAVES.
Jon: WYATT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT AMERICA?
IT SAYS THERE AREN'T ENOUGH BLACK PEOPLE MAKING....
Jon: PERHAPS WE CAN....
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT INSULTING BLACK PEOPLE. THAT RAND McNALLY GUY WAS KIND OF A RACIST. WHY ON EARTH WOULD THERE BE PLACES LIKE CHINK PEAK? DAGO PEAK? SQUAW'S HEAD MOUNTAIN? JAP ROAD. SPOOK WOODS AND MEXICAN GULCH?
Jon: THIS IS EMBARRASSING FOR AMERICA.
JON I DISAGREE. WHILE AMERICA MAY HAVE A LEGACY OF INTOLERANCE IT'S ALSO SHOWN IT HAS THE CAPACITY  TO LEARN FROM ITS MISTAKES AND TRANSFORM THOSE UGLY FEELINGS INTO EXPRESSIONS OF OUR  HIGHEST IDEALS.
Jon: WOW. THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, WYATT. IT'S SO EASY TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE SHAMEFUL PARTS AND OVERLOOK THE BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY.
YEAH IT REMINDS ME OF THAT SONG, "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL. "THE LOST VERSES. SING ALONG. ♪ OH, BEAUTIFUL FOR RIVERS WIDE ♪♪ ♪ AND STRONG LIKE DARKEY  CREEK ♪♪ ♪ FOR HALF-BREED HILL AND DAGO'S NOSE ♪♪  ♪ THE SNOW UPON CHINK'S PEAK ♪♪
Jon: DON'T DO THAT, WYATT.
♪ AMERICA, AMERICA, GOD SHED HIS GRACE ON THEE ♪♪  ♪ AND KEEP THE BLACKS ACROSS THE TRACKS ♪♪  ♪ FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA ♪♪
Jon: WYATT CENAC, EVERYBOD
