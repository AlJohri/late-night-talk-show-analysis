[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MARRIAGE EQUALITY SEEMS TO BE GAINING TRACTION IN EVEN THE REDDEST OF RED STATES. WE TAKE A LOOK AT A SPECIAL EDITION OF -- GAYWATCH [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SOME PEOPLE HAVE PAY CABLE. FIRST UP,  BIG NON-OSMOND NEWS OUT OF UTAH.
WEDDING BELLS FOR SAME SEX COUPLES IN UTAH. A FEDERAL JUDGE STRUCK DOWN THE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BAN DECLARING IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL THERE BY LEGALIZING GAY UNIONS IN THAT STATE.
Jon: WOOO! WOOO! WOOO! CHEERS TO YOU, UTAH, FINALLY ALL THOSE CLEAN CUT YOUNG MEN IN SHORT SLEEVE SHIRTS WE SEE PAIRED UP HERE IN NEW YORK CITY CAN GO HOME AND GET MARRIED.
THE SUPREME COURT HAS PUT A STOP TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGES IN UTAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OH, THOSE POOR BOYS.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL RECOGNIZE SAME SEX MARRIAGES THAT WERE PERFORMED FOR A SHORT TIME IN UTAH. DOES IT CLEAR UP ANY OF THE CONFUSION?
IT REALLY DOESN'T. BECAUSE IT'S ON HOLD IN UTAH. UTAH IS NOT RECOGNIZING THE MARRIAGES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HOORAY IT'S BACK ON KIND OF. HERE COMES THE BRIDES BUT ONLY FOR FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES. [ LAUGHTER ] OTHERWISE IT'S JUST SHARON AND HER ROOMMATE. [ LAUGHTER ]
HOW RIDICULOUS IT IS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT YOU CAN BE A MARRIED COUPLE ONE MONTH AND THEN THE NEXT MONTH HAVE IT BE COMPLETELY ANNULLED.
Jon: THE WHOLE THING IS RIDICULOUS. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING YOU HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT, UTAH BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THESE COUPLES ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSIDERED BOTH MARRIED AND UNMARRIED. A SHRODINGER'S COUPLE. A SHRODINGER'S COUPLE, IF YOU WILL. A SHRODINGER'S COUPLE, IF YOU WILL.
NO, I WON'T JON.
Jon: JASON I'M TRYING TO DO A HEADLINE HERE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH COOL. IS IT A HEADLINE ON HOW YOU FUNDAMENTALLY MISUNDERSTOOD SHRODINGER'S THEORY? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE CERTAIN RHETORICAL SIMILARITIES TO THE CASE OF UTAH MARRIAGE EQUALITY BUT A LEGAL DISCORDANCE IS HARDLY ANALOGOUS TO QUANTUM INDETERMINACY.
Jon: WOW, I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD SUCH A FLUENCY IN POST NEWTONIAN PHYSICS.
WELL PERHAPS NEXT TIME YOU WON'T BE SO CAVALIER IN YOUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT ME. NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN MY PENIS STUCK INSIDE THIS CANTALOUPE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: ALL RIGHT. EITHER THAT OR YOU HAVE A TERRIBLE MOSQUITO BITE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JASON. [ LAUGHTER ] [  APPLAUSE  ] ALL RIGHT. THE OLD QUANTUM PHYSICS AND I GOT MY [BLEEP] STUCK IN SOME FRUIT GAG. MOVING ON, OUR NEXT RED STATE, OKLAHOMA, IF UTAH IS A DEEP CLARET OKLAHOMA IS A SLIGHTLY LIGHTER VERMILION. SOMETIMES ON THE SIDE I NAME COLORS FOR THE J CREW CATALOGUE. GO.
A FEDERAL JUDGE  YESTERDAY RULING OKLAHOMA'S BAN ON MARRIAGE EQUALITY AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
Jon: WOW, BOY IF THINGS KEEP GOING LIKE THAT, SOMEONE'S GOING TO WRITE A WHOLE MUSICAL ABOUT THAT PLACE.  THIS DECISION CAME IN PART THANKS TO COUPLES LIKE SHARON BALDWIN AND MARY BISHOP, TWO OF THE PLAINTIFFS WHO SUED TO OVERTURN THE BAN.
YOU ARE BOTH JOURNALISTS. BOTH GIVE ME A HEADLINE ON THIS STORY. YOU FIRST, SHARON.
ECSTASY.
Jon: WOW. YOU KNOW I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT ANGERS CONSERVATIVES MORE THAN A LESBIAN COUPLE SUING FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY IS A LESBIAN COUPLE OF JOURNALISTS SUING FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY. LOOK MARRIAGE EQUALITY'S OBVIOUSLY AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE, ONE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF SENSITIVE FEELINGS ABOUT. WHO BETTER TO ADDRESS  SENSITIVE SUBJECTS THAN TEXAS CONGRESSMAN LOUIE GOHMERT.
THE SUPREME COURT HAD SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T IMPART, BASICALLY THEY DIDN'T SEE ANY BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT MARRIAGE BEING BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN AND THEY NEED SOME BASIC PLUMBING LESSONS.
Jon: YEAH, MAN, PLUMBING, RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE RIGHT LOUIE GOHMERT, WE HAVE TO MODEL ALL SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS ON PLUMBING WHERE THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE MATCH IS A MALE PIPE TO A FEMALE FITTING UNLESS OF COURSE YOU HAVE A MALE TO MALE CONNECTION OR FEMALE TO FEMALE COUPLING. OR A HOOK UP BETWEEN TWO MALES OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND ONE FEMALE. THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF HOT.
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT, JON.  YOU'RE JUST NEEEVER GONNA GET IT OFF. THANK YOU JASON JONES, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
