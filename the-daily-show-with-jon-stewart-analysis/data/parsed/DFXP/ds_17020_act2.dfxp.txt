I GOT-- I CAME OUT HERE, I WANTED TO REMEMBER THREE THINGS TO TELL YOU.
Jon: TELL ME.
I CAN'T REMEMBER ANY OF THEM, I GOT NONE, I GOT NONE, HOW ARE YOU.
Jon: I'M DOING VERY WELL.
THE CORDUROY SEEMS THICK FOR THIS --
I HAD CORDUROY PANTS ON TOO AND SOMEBODY SAID DON'T WEAR CORDUROY ON CORDUROY SO  I SWITCHED IT OUT THIS SAY NEW THING, MY WIFE HAS BEEN GETTING ME NEW CLOTHES. I LOOK BACK AT PIE OLD, I HAVE BEEN ON TELEVISION A LONG TIME AND I'VE BEEN  WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES LITERALLY ON EVERY SHOW. SO SHE WENT OUT AND GOT ME THIS CORDUROY SHIRT THIS OTHER FLANNEL ONE AND A T-SHIRT.
Jon: BUT THE R WORD AND AGAIN THIS IS NOTHING AGAINST THE WIFE, BUT THAT  IS NOT-- THAT'S NOT A SHIRT. YOU'RE WEARING-- THAT IS CLEARLY SOME SORT OF COAT SHIRT HYBRID. THAT'S NOT --
BECAUSE SHE WAS BEING NICE AND KNEW I WAS GOING TO BE COLD, ALSO I DON'T-- I  REFUSE TO TRY ON THINGS SO LIKE WHEN I GO TO A STORE, SHE GOES HEY, YOU WANT A-- AND I SAY JUST GET IT. AND THEN IT'S EITHER TOO BIG OR TOO TIGHT BUT I HAVE TO WEAR IT ANYWAYS BECAUSE--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOW IT DOES SEEM LIKE UNDERNEATH THE NEW --
IS AN OLDER SHIRT.
Jon: SHIRT JACKET OR SHACKET.
THAT'S WHY I HAD IT BUTTONED TO COVER THE OLD TO SHOW THE WIFE RESPECT.
Jon: S THIS'S THE KEY TO A HAPPY MARRIAGE, THOSE TYPES OF COMPROMISES.
THANK YOU.
Jon: AT WHAT POINT, BECAUSE SI HAVE BEEN-- WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED PROBABLY ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT. HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN MARRIED?
I-- WITH THE SAME GIRL 14, MARRIED ABOUT 7 OR 8.
Jon: VERY SIMILAR, WITH MY WIFE FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS, AND MI JUST GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE MY OUTFIT.
THIS IS A NEW THING, SHE WAS COOL AT THE BEGINNING AND STARTED REALIZING, HE IS  DRESSES NICE AND I HAVE THE TWO DAUGHTERS WHO YELL AT ME FOR NOT DRESSING NICE. SO THAT BECAME LIKE A FACTOR IN THE HOUSE. WHEN WHICH COME DOWNSTAIRS IN THE MORNING AND ALL THREE OF THEM WOULD SAY PLEASE DON'T. THEN I SAID ALL RIGHT, GO GET ME SOME NEW STUFF.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I GET IN THE HOUSE, THIS IS NEW AS WELL, DADDY, I DON'T LIKE  THE YOU SMELL.
THAT'S NOT YOU. THEIR NOSE IS STRONGER AT THAT AGE. (LAUGHTER) YEAH NO, NO NO, MY KIDS, MY KIDS, IF I-- SHE'LL SAY BRUSH YOUR TEETH A LITTLE  BETTER, BRUSH YOUR TEETH A LITTLE BETTER AND MAYBE I'LL KISS YOU.
Jon: THAT'S NICE THOUGH, AND ALSO CONCERN FOR YOUR HEALTH BECAUSE PLACKE, THE BACTERIA, ONE OF THE LEADING  CAUSES OF ALL KINDS OF DISTRESS THEY'RE FINDING THESE DAYS.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. THAT'S NICE OF HER TO DO THAT.
SHE LOVES HER DAD.
Jon: YOU SAY SHE BUT ONLY ONE LOVES THE DAD. THE OTHER-- BECAUSE THERE IS THREE.
THE OTHER ONE IS YOUNG ENOUGH TO GET PAST THE STENCH AND GET RIGHT IN  THERE AND START KISSING ME. IT'S THE FIVE-YEAR-OLD THAT JUST GOES THIS IS REALLY HORRIFIC WHAT I'M SMELLING  RIGHT NOW.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. I APPRECIATE THOUGH YOUR USE OF VOCABULARY.
HORRIFIC.
THAT WAS GIANT, HORRIFIC IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS. HORRIFIC AND MET MORES TO US IS A NICE ONE.
Stephen: THAT IS A NICE ONE.
THAT'S ALL I GOT.
Jon: ARE YOU GOING TO STICK AROUND AND WATCH THE JETS.
I WITHOUT LIKE TO SEE THAT. MY KIDS WANT ME TO GET BACK TO L.A. THEY DEMANDED I COME HOME. I SAID IT'S ONE EXTRA DAY, IF I COULD SEE THE JETS-PATS GAME. YOU COULD WATCH IT ON TELEVISION, THEY SAID. SO I'M GOING TO GO HOME.
Jon: WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU MADE A DECISION? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
THAT'S A GOOD ONE, JONNY.
Jon: I MEAN ARE YOU WRAPPED IN CORDUROY, YOU CAN'T WATCH-- YOU'RE LIKE A  SHELL OF YOURSELF. ARE YOU LIKE A MICROWAVEABLE BURRITYO IN THAT THING.
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS. MY KIDS FALL ASLEEP MAYBE 9, 89:30, 9:00, MAYBE 10. THE WIFE FALLS ASLEEP MAYBE 1:00. FROM 1:00 UNTIL 6:00 IT'S BANANAS. YOU GOT TO SEE. I PUT ON MY OLD CLOTHES, AND LAY THERE.
Jon: FAMILY TIME. THAT'S VERY NICE. ARE WE GOING-- WE'RE GOING, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE, ARE WE DOING ANOTHER ONE? WE MIGHT DO ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, THE LAST ACT, I  JUST YELLED AT PEOPLE FOR LIKE TWO MINUTES T WASN'T THAT FUNNY.
WHAT IS IT?
