Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING]
Jon: HELLO, EVERYBODY. I'M JON STEWART, AND BOY DID WE PUT ON A PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT, OUR GUEST MR. BOB ODENKIRK AND MR. DAVID CROSS. I'M VERY EXCITED. WE BEGIN TONIGHT, OF COURSE, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ADDRESS ON SYRIA. I'M KIDDING AROUND. THAT'S NOT THE BIG STORY. THE BIG NEWS LAST NIGHT WAS NOT SYRIA, BUT THE RESULTS OF NEW YORK'S MAYORAL PRIMARY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. PUBLIC ADVOCATE BILL DE BLASIO WON THE NIGHT WITH THE HELP OF HIS  INCREDIBLY AWESOME FAMILY.
THEY'RE BLOWING KISSES TO THE CROWD. A VERY PHOTOGENIC FAMILY.
Jon: THEY'RE A PHOTOGENIC FAMILY? I RARELY SAY THIS ABOUT THE MEDIA, BUT YOU'RE UNDERSELLING IT. PHOTOGENIC DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE. CHECK OUT THIS VICTORY PARTY MOVE THEY PULLED.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND NOW THE SMACKDOWN.
Reporter: THE ENTIRE DE BLASIO FAMILY, INCLUDING SON DANTE AND DAUGHTER KIARA DID A WEIRD GYMNASTIC MOVE THAT BROUGHT HUGE CHEERS FROM THE CROWD.  [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ADOPT ME. YES, SOMEHOW AFTER 12 YEARS OF CAPTAIN SODA NARC, I THINK NEW YORK CITY MIGHT BE READY FOR A CHARISMATIC BIRACIAL FAMILY WITH THEIR OWN SYNCHRONIZED DANCE MOVES, THAT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN BEAMED HERE FROM THE 1970s MUSIC VARIETY SPECIAL. WHO IS BETTER THAN THIS FAMILY? NOBODY IS BETTER THAN THIS FAMILY. YOU'VE GOT KIARA, THE CONFIDENT DAUGHTER. YOU'VE GOT DANTE, THE SON WHO IS SO CHARMING AND SO CHARISMATIC. I MEAN, HE IS UNBELIEVABLE. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING]  [APPLAUSE]
Jon: HOW DID HE DO THAT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: JUST BY WATCHING HIM, IT SPROUTED. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. OH! THAT IS TRULY DISAPPOINTING. OH, LOOK EVERYBODY. HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? [CHEERING]
HEY, TURN THAT DOWN! TURN THAT DOWN! [BLEEP] [LAUGHTER] [BOOING]
Jon: AND FORGET ABOUT ALL OF THAT, THERE IS HIS WIFE, CHIRLANE MCCRAY, WHO, AND THIS IS TRUE, UNTIL SHE MET HER HUSBAND WAS AN AVOWED LESBIAN, WHICH WE KNOW FROM HER 1979 ESSENCE MAGAZINE ARTICLE, "I AM A LESBIAN." THIS IS WHY DE BLASIO CAN WIN IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. THE DEMOCRATS LOVE HIM BECAUSE HE IS AN OLD-FASHIONED NEW YORK PROGRESSIVE, AND THE REPUBLICANS LOVE HIM, BECAUSE HE CAN TURN GAY PEOPLE STRAIGHT. WHAT'S BETTER THAN THAT? MEANWHILE, ON THE AGONY OF DEFEAT SIDE, FORMER CONGRESSMAN TURNED SOCIAL MEDIA PIONEER ANTHONY WEINER.
WE HAD THE BEST IDEAS. SADLY, I WAS AN IMPERFECT MESSENGER. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS]
Jon: "AN IMPERFECT MESSENGER," IS A U.P.S. GUY WHO DINGS UP YOUR PACKAGE A LITTLE BIT. YOU'RE MORE LIKE IF THE U.P.S. GUY SHOWED YOU HIS PACKAGE AND THEN TOLD YOU HE WAS GOING TO (bleep) YOU SO HARD YOUR TITS ALMOST HIT YOU IN THE FACE.
Jon: HERE'S THE THING... [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS]
Jon: I'M TRYING TO SLEEP. KEEP IT DOWN. I'M TRYING TO SLEEP! [BOOS]
Jon: OH, YOU LOVE AFRO JON. LOOK, WEINER HAD TO HAVE KNOWN HE WAS GOING TO LOSE. SO, YOU KNOW, HOW BAD COULD HIS NIGHT HAVE BEEN.
THE CONCESSION PARTY FELT LIKE A CIRCUS. FIRST, SYDNEY LEATHERS SHOWED UP, THE WOMAN WHO PUBLICIZED HER ONLINE RELATIONSHIP WITH WEINER IN JULY. AIDS EVENTUALLY SNUCK HIM INTO THE BAR THROUGH A NEIGHBORING MCDONALDS. THE SECURITY TEAM SCUFFLED WITH REPORTERS. THE CANDIDATE'S RESPONSE, A RAISED MIDDLE FINGER THROUGH THE WINDOW JUST BEFORE DRIVING OFF.
Jon: OKAY, HE IS LEARNING. AT LEAST NOW HE IS JUST FLASHING HIS FINGER. I MEAN, THAT'S BABY STEPS. FOR MORE ON THE END OF ANTHONY WEINER'S MAYORAL CAMPAIGN, WE GO LIVE TO JOHN OLIVER. JOHN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
Reporter: YOU KNOW, JOHN, IT IS REALLY BECOMING ALMOST A CLICHE IN AMERICAN POLITICS. A HARD-FOUGHT POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ENDED WITH A MAN BEING CHASED THROUGH McDONALD'S TO AVOID HIS AMATEUR PORN STAR VIRTUAL MISTRESS STALKER BEFORE BIDDING THE LOCAL MEDIA A HEARTY [BLEEP]. IT'S A DANCE AS OLD AS TIME.
Jon: IT IS NOT REALLY HOW IT SEEMS A MAYORAL CAMPAIGN USUALLY ENDS. IT IS MORE LIKE AN EPISODE OF "COPS" WOULD END.
A GOOD ONE.
Jon: TELL ME THE TRUTH, ARE YOU GOING TO MISS HIM A LITTLE BIT?
NO, NOT A LITTLE BIT.
Jon: A SMIDGEON?
NO. I'M NOT GOING TO MISS HIM.
Jon: YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MISS THE DANGER?
NO. ♪♪♪ DANGER ♪
Jon: YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT?
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT, JON. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS]
NO. NO.
Jon: WOW! WOW!
WAIT. I'M STANDING OUTSIDE McDONALD'S.
Jon: YOU REALLY ARE "HARRY POTTER." DO THE (bleep) DANCE.
I'M NOT DOING THE (bleep) DANCE. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. NO, NO, NO. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS]
HOLD ON.
Jon: WHY NOT, OLIVER, WHY NOT?
IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT ANYMORE, JON. SURE, IT WAS FUN WHEN HE WAS STILL RUNNING FOR OFFICE, BEING A DICK TO EVERYONE HE MET. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE ITS ME, BUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HIM SPRINTING PAST THE DOLLAR VALUE MENU AND HIS LONELY CAR RIDE HOME WITH ONLY HIS MIDDLE FINGER TO KEEP HIM COMPANY, I KIND OF LOST THE STOMACH FOR THIS.
Jon: WHAT, ARE YOU COMEDIAN OR A HUMAN BEING?
CAN'T I BE BOTH?
Jon: NO.
OKAY, I'LL DO IT. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO ENJOY IT. [LAUGHTER]
IT'S NOT THE SAME. HE'S A PATHETIC INDIVIDUAL.
Jon: JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY. LET HIM HEAR IT. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS]
