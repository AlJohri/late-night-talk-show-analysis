( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. MARIJUANA. ( LAUGHTER ). MAKES AUDIENCES GO WOOO!
WOOO!
Jon:  BUT HAVE WE  CONSIDERED HOW LEGALIZING IT  WILL AFFECT OUR NATION'S MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS? AL MADRIGAL HAS MORE.
MARIJUANA ADVOCATE ROBERT IS  ON A MISSION TO CONVINCE OUR  LEGISLATORS TO LEGALIZE MEDICINAL POT, AND HE'S STARTING  WITH THE MOST IMPRESSIONABLE  AMONG US-- OUR BUBBIES. THAT'S RIGHT. HE'S TAKING A PRO-GRASS ROAD  SHOW TO RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES  ALL ACROSS FLORIDA.
THE SILVER TOUR TEACHES  SENIORS THE BENEFITS OF MEDICAL  MARIJUANA.
AND OLD PEOPLE ARE BUYING ALL  OF THIS?
ALMOST 100%. IT TREATS ARTHRITIS. ALZHEIMER'S. GLAUCOMA. MONTEL WILLIAMS HAS BEEN  PREACHING FOR A LONG TIME THAT,  THAT'S WHAT GETS HIM UP AND ENABLES HIM--
LET'S NOT DRAG MONTEL  WILLIAMS INTO THIS, OKAY. ALL RIGHT PRO-POT ADVOCATES WE  SEE YOUR BALD BLACK MAN AND  RAISE YOU A BLACK BALD MAN.
MARIJUANA IS THE SLIPPERY  SLOPE TO HELL. IT'S A GATEWAY DRUG.
WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO SAY IF  YOU MAKE IT TO 90 WHO GIVES A  CRAP WHAT YOU DO? YOU CAN SHOOT HEROINE INTO YOUR  NUT SACKS.
I WILL GIVE A CARE WHAT I DO  IF I MAKE TOW 90. I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO GET  STONED AND SIT AROUND THE HOME  DOING NOTHING.
YES, OUR ELDERLY ARE  COMPLETELY UNPREPARED FOR HOW  MARIJUANA WILL AFFECT THEIR COUCH-BOUND, JUDGE JUDY WATCHING  SCHEDULE.
TAKE ABE TOTE. MAYBE EAT A MAGIC BROWNIE. IT FITS SO WELL INTO THE SENIOR  LIFESTYLE. IT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY THING  THEY CAN USE THAT'S ACTUALLY  GOING TO GIVE THEM A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE, TAKE AWAY A LOT  OF THEIR PAIN.
AND EVEN THOUGH MEDICAL  MARIJUANA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO  REDUCE PAIN FOR A.L.S., DIABETES, GLAUCOMA,  FIBROMYALGIA, ARTHRITIS,  MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND A FEW  OTHER THINGS, WHAT ABOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS?
MARIJUANA SLOWS DOWN YOUR  MOTOR SKILLS. YOU CAN'T-- YOU CAN'T DRIVE  CORRECTLY. IT SLURS YOUR SPEECH.
SO PRETTY MUCH THE SAME SIDE  EFFECTS AS BEING OLD.
MARIJUANA, NOT PRESCRIBED BY  THEIR DOCTOR, THEY SHOULDN'T BE  USING MARIJUANA.
BUT DOCTOR-PRESCRIBED  MEDICINES IS FINE.
PRESCRIBED DRUGS GO THROUGH A  TOUGH EXAMINATION BY THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT BIKER THE F.D.A.
EXACTLY. GOVERNMENT-APPROVED IMMEDIATE  ONLY HAS THESE MINE SIDE  EFFECTS.
STIFF MUSCLES AND CONFUSION. DRY MOUTH AND INSOMNIA. UNCONTROLLABLE MUSCLE MOVEMENTS. BLEEDING AND ULCERS. SEXUAL SIDE EFFECTS. UNPLEASANT TASTE. DIARRHEA. SEIZURE. LUNG CANCER. RARE BY FATAL INFECTIONS. HEART ATTACK OR STROKE.
AND MAY CAUSE DEATH.
WHILE WEED, ON THE OTHER  HAND, CAN LEAD TO SUCH PROBLEMS  AS EARLY-ONSET HUNGER SYNDROME AND CHRONIC KEYBOARDING. DESPITE THESE DANGERS, HE HAD A  FINAL PITCH THAT WOULD SEAL THE  DEAL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR  LISTENING. ENJOY THE BUFFET.
THAT'S RIGHT. THE FIRST BUFFET IS FREE. AND THE SENIORS, BUZZING FROM  THEIR WHITE FISH HIGHS, WERE  HOOKED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF  REACTION IT WILL HAVE, BUT I'M  WILLING TO TRY IT.
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY IT.
IF IT WILL HELP ME IN ANY WAY  MAKE ME FEEL BETTER FOR THE REST  OF MY LIFE, I'D TRY ANYTHING.
YOU'D TRY ANYTHING?
SURE.
WHY NOT MOVE TO BANGKOK AND  HANG OUT WITH A GANG OF  TRANSVESTITE HOOKERS AND SHOOT  UP?
I LIKE TO TRAVEL.
BISHOP ALLEN KNEW HE NEEDED  TO BE VIGILANT IN THIS BATTLE. LET'S ROLE PLAY. I'LL BE A SENIOR CITIZEN AND YOU  TELL ME WHY I SHOULDN'T GET  HIGH.
OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE NOT  FEELING WELL. MARIJUANA IS NOT LEGAL, AND YOU  SHOULD ONLY USE THE PILLS.
BUT THE PILLS MAKE ME SICK.
POT WILL MAKE YOU NOT BE ABLE  TO FUNCTION.
WHO ARE YOU? SOMEONE LET A BLACK MAN INTO THE  COMMUNITY CENTER. ( LAUGHTER ). BUT WHILE TOO MANY SENIORS HAVE  FALLEN PREY TO LOOKING COOL AND  PEER PRESSURE, THERE WAS ONE BRAVE SOUL WHO VOWED TO REMAIN  PURE. ARE YOU GOING TO BE SMOKING  MARIJUANA?
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, I'M ON  ENOUGH PILLS ALREADY. I'VE GOT PILLS FOR MY PAIN. I'VE GOT PILLS FOR MY HEART.
I GOT THESE FROM THELMA THAT  I MET EARLIER IF YOU WANT TO  TRADE.
SURE. LET'S DO IT. AND THESE TWO WILL FIX YOUR  HEART UP.
OH, AWESOME. LET'S DO IT.
ONE, TWO, THREE. WHOOO!  ♪ ONE PILL MAKES YOU LARGER... AND ONE PILL MAKES YOU...  ♪ ♪
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR JAZZ  CIGARETTE AND MARY JANE BUT ME  AND STEVE KNOW THE TRUTH PATH TO ENLIGHTENMENT IS PRESCRIBED BY  DOCTORS. SIDE EFFECT MAY INCLUDE  EXHILARATION, COLORED LENSES.
Jon:  AL MADRIGAL, WE'LL
