Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A JOURNALIST, THE HOST OF "KATIE" HER NEW DOCUMENTARY FILM FOR WHICH SHE SERVES AS EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND NARRATOR IS CALLED "FED UP.
THIS IS THE FIRST GENERATION OF AMERICAN CHILDREN EXPECTED TO LEAD SHORTER LIVES THAN THEIR PARENTS.
I AM 12 YEARS OLD AND MY DOCTORS HAVE SAID THAT I'M A STATISTIC.
WE'RE BLAMING WILL POWER AND IT'S A CRIME. THE GOVERNMENT IS SUBSIDIZING THE OBESITY EPIDEM.
WE PLACE PRIVATE PROFIT AHEAD OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SYSTEMATIC POLITICAL FAILURE.
BY 2050, ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE AMERICANS WILL HAVE DIABETES.
THOSE DISEASES ARE BEING DRIVEN BY SUGAR.
THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT IN SOCIETY.
WE COULD CURE 80% OF THE PROBLEM WHERE THEY PREPARE THE FOOD IN THE SCHOOL. YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE DIET OF AMERICA.
IT'S ALL PREVENTABLE.
Jon:  IT'S A HORROR MOVIE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, KATIE COURIC! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WAS GOING TO SAY GIVE ME SOME SUGAR, AND THEN I THOUGHT BETTER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
NICE, NICE. I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE. ♪ HI, KATIE COURIC ♪
HI JON, HOW ARE YOU?
Jon:  THIS DOCUMENTARY IS WILDLY DISTURBING.
YES, IT IS.
Jon:  AND IT IS PACKED WITH FACTS THAT I THINK PEOPLE MIGHT BE INCREDIBLY UNAWARE OF.
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE STARTED LOOKING INTO THIS. I HAD COVERED THIS STORY FOR 35 YEARS, MY ENTIRE CAREER, AND I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE PROBLEM KEPT GETTING WORSE. AND NOBODY WAS REALLY KIND OF ROLLING UP THEIR SLEEVES AND DIGGING INTO THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE EPIDEMIC, BUT SOME OF THE STATISTICS WE DISCOVERED ARE REALLY DISTURBING, AS YOU SAID, JON. STAGGERING. IN 1980 THERE WERE ZERO CASES OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG ADOLESCENTS. IN 2010, ALMOST 58,000 CASES OF TYPE 2 DIABETES. ONE IN THREE PEOPLE BY 2050 IS GONNA HAVE DIABETES.
Jon:  AND 90% ARE GOING TO BE OBESE BY 2050?
IN TWO DECADES, 95% OF AMERICANS WILL BE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. AND THIS I THINK IS THE SADDEST STATISTIC OF ALL THAT WE HEARD IN THAT CLIP. THIS GENERATION OF CHILDREN IS THE FIRST-- FIRST THAT WILL LIVE SHORTER LIFESPANS THAN THEIR PARENTS.
Jon: RIGHT. THE WORST THING I SAW-- OTHER THAN THE HUMAN PAIN OF THESE KIDS.
OH, YEAH.
Jon:  WHICH IS HEARTBREAKING.
ISN'T IT AMAZING, BY THE WAY, THAT THEY PARTICIPATED IN THIS?
Jon:  YES.
I MEAN, THEY DESERVE SO MUCH CREDIT.
Jon:  INCREDIBLY COURAGEOUS, AND THE STRUGGLE IS ENORMOUS.
HEARTBREAKING.
Jon:  WHEN THEY PUT THEIR HEARTS ON THEIR SLEEVES LIKE THAT IT IS JUST HEARTBREAKING. BUT BEYOND THAT IS THE CORRUPTION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO RELEASE A REPORT-- AND YOU HAVE IT IN THE FILM-- THAT SAYS THESE ISSUES ABOUT SUGAR --
RIGHT, SUGAR SHOULD BE 10%, NO MORE THAN 10% OF THE DIET.
Jon: RIGHT NO MORE THAN 10%.  WE SEND OVER TOMMY THOMPSON TO TELL THEM, IF YOU PUT THAT IN THERE, WE WILL NOT GIVE YOU THE MONEY --
THE $450 MILLION.
Jon:  THE $450 MILLION WE WERE GOING TO GIVE YOU AND THEY TAKE IT OUT. WE BASICALLY BRIBE THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION TO TAKE THIS OUT.
WELL, AS ROBERT LUSTIG SAID, WE PRETTY MUCH EXTORT THEM INTO KEEPING THAT QUIET.
Jon: RIGHT. AND THEN THE SUGAR LOBBY SAYS, ACTUALLY IT SHOULD BE 25% OF YOUR DIET, WHICH IS TWO AND A HALF TIMES --
Jon:  THE QUESTION FOR THE SUGAR LOBBY GUY WAS TREMENDOUS WHEN YOU ASKED HIM, YOU KNOW, IS SUGAR TIED TO THESE THINGS-- IT REMINDS YOU OF THAT TOBACCO STORY-- AND HE'S UNABLE TO ANSWER IT.
WELL, AND A LOT OF THESE STUDIES ARE FINANCED, UNFORTUNATELY BY, YOU KNOW, BIG FOOD COMPANIES. >>Jon: RIGHT. SO NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY PURE IN THEIR-- IN THEIR EXECUTION.
Jon: BUT WHAT IS, IS THE ANSWER PURELY ABOUT GOING BACK TO A TIME WHEN WE DON'T ADD SUGAR? BECAUSE WE DID EAT LIKE CRAP.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK, I THINK, I MEAN, I THINK THERE'S A WHOLE CONFLUENCE OF THINGS. I THINK YOU REALLY-- YES, OF COURSE, WE DID EAT SOME THINGS THAT WEREN'T VERY HEALTHY BUT, YOU KNOW, ALL I CAN SAY IS THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE, JON, RIGHT?
Jon: NO, NO, SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.
SO ALL WE CAN DO IS POINT TO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS, AND I THINK YOU SHOULD PROBABLY REDUCE YOUR INTAKE OF PROCESSED FOODS, PEOPLE SHOULD EAT WHOLE FOODS. PEOPLE DON'T REALLY COOK ANYMORE--
BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS, DON'T THEY?
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP DIDN'T YOUR -- I DON'T KNOW. IF THEY KNOW IT, THEY'RE NOT DOING IT. AND I THINK THEY--
Jon:  BUT, ISN'T IT BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH CHEAPER? I MEAN, IF I'M OUT THERE, AND I CAN GO TO MCDONALDS AND GET --
NO, WE SHOW IN THE FILM, AS YOU SEE, WE SHOW A MEAL FROM A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT, AND A CHICKEN AND VEGETABLES COOKED AT HOME AND THAT'S REALLY --
Jon: BUT THEY MADE IT. AND THEY HAVE A DRIVE-THROUGH. ( LAUGHTER ).
THAT'S TRUE. AND THE CONVENIENCE IS A THING. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO ALL FIGURE OUT, YOU KNOW, WHERE ARE OUR PRIORITIES? WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO? AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS SOMETHING WE CARE ABOUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO IT FOR OUR KIDS, REALLY. BECAUSE OTHERWISE, YOU KNOW, AS WE SAID, WE'RE KILLING PEOPLE.
Jon:  CAN I TELL YOU? I KNOW. IT'S JUST-- SO OFTEN THE POLITICIANS ALWAYS SAY WE MUST DO IT FOR OUR KIDS, AND IT'S CLEAR TO ME, AT LEAST, THAT WE HATE OUR KIDS. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE WE-- WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THIS FOR, LIKE, 200 YEARS AND WE'RE LIKE YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, OUR KIDS. WE NEVER. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT REALLY FEELS LIKE A GIANT MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB.
WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, EVEN SMALL STEPS, LIKE LOOKING AT LABELS AND UNDERSTANDING-- YOU KNOW, YOU NEED A CALCULATOR WHEN YOU GO TO THE GROCERY STORE. FOUR GRAMS OF SUGAR EQUALS ONE TEASPOON, RIGHT. AND YOU WOULD BE SHOCKED IF YOU ADD UP THE ADDED SUGAR IN A LOT OF PRODUCTS.
Jon: RIGHT. SO, I SHOP A LOT DIFFERENTLY. I USED TO ALWAYS BUY LOW-FAT STUFF. I DON'T NOW. I LOOK AT THE SUGAR CONTENT, AND I THINK EVEN IF PEOPLE WERE JUST MORE MINDFUL ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE BUYING, >>Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WHAT THEY'RE PURCHASING.
Jon: I THINK IT ALSO WORKS AS PRESSURE ON A LARGER LEVEL POLITICALLY.
I HOPE SO.
Jon:  WHEN YOU DO SOME THINGS LIKE THIS IT SORT OF WAKES PEOPLE UP.
THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA JUST INVITED ME TO THEIR ANNUAL LEADERSHIP FORUM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  I HAVE-- CAN I SAY THIS?
YEAH.
Jon:  I HAVE THREE WORDS FOR YOU, YOUNG LADY.
BE CAREFUL? PLEASE.
Jon:  NO, THAT'S TWO.
I ADDED PLEASE!
Jon: PLEASE. I WAS GOING TO GO WITH PAPER OR PLASTIC? "FED UP" IS IN THE THEATERS NATIONWIDE ON FRIDAY. ENJOY IT WITH SOME REESE'S PIECES AND SOME POPCORN.
NO! COME ON!
Jon:  NO? THAT'S WRONG? BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE AT THE MOVIES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
