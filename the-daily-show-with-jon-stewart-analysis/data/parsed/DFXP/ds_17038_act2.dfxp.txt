SHOW. SO AS YOU NAY KNOW, HEADING INTO LAST NIGHT'S CAUCUS, MINNESOTA CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN  WAS FEELING A PARTICULAR KIND OF SPECIAL CONFIDENCE.
WE'RE GOING TO SEE A MIRACLE HAPPEN ON TUESDAY. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT.
Jon: AND LO FOR MANY MONTHS DID BACHMANN DWELL AMONGST  IOWA'S VOTERS AND CAME IN SIXTH. OKAY. [LAUGHTER] OUT OF SIX. [LAUGHTER] YET WHEN SHE DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE THIS MORNING, BACHMANN MADE ONE THING STILL VERY CLEAR. >>LY NOT BE CONTINUING IN THIS RACE FOR THE PRESIDENCY. MY FAITH IN THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, THIS COUNTRY AND OUR REPUBLIC IS UNSHAKABLE.
Jon: UNSHAKEABLE. HER FAITH IN GOD. SHE WAS EXPECTING A MIRACLE, REALLY DIDN'T GET IT, AND YET STILL HAS FAITH. PERHAPS SHE THINKS GOD IS SETTING HER UP HERE. MAYBE FOR ONE OF THOSE GOD MOMENTS LIKE WHEN ABRAHAM WAS ABOUT TO STAB ISAAC AND GOD WAS  LIKE [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER] BUT THE TROUBLE, OF COURSE, WAS THAT THE REPUBLICAN FIELD BACHMANN WAS COMPETING AGAINST  NOT JUST FOR THE FACT THEY WERE REPUBLICAN VOTERS BUT FOR THE AFFECTION OF GOD WAS EQUALLY  TENACIOUS IN THEIR PURSUIT OF THE BIG MAN.
IT IS TO THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS THAT WE GIVE PRAISE THIS EVENING.
OUR CONVICTION THAT FREEDOM IS A GIFT OF GOD.
AND WITH A LITTLE PRAYER AND REFLECTION, I'M GOING TO DECIDE THE BEST PATH FORWARD.
FOR LOVING ME, WARTS AND ALL, I OFFER A PUBLIC THANKS TO GOD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: GOD MAY LOVE YOU, BUT I THINK HE'S JUST BEING POLITE  ABOUT THE WARTS QUITE FRANKLY. FOR MORE ON WHICH CANDIDATE MAY RECEIVE THE COVETED GOD ENDORSEMENT, WE GO OUT THE WYATT CENAC. WYATT, WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M IN HEAVEN, JON.
Jon: WHAT? THAT LOOKS LIKE A VEGAS SPORTS BOG.
GOD'S GOT HIS HANDS IN A LOT OF HUMAN PIE, FOOTBALL, GRAMMY, LATIN GRAMMY, AMERICAN MUSIC AWARD, COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS, ASIAN COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS.
Jon: GOD'S JUST KEEPING AN EYE ON SPORTS AND AWARDS SHOWS.
THAT'S WHY HE'S GOT PICTURE IN PICTURE IN PICTURE FOREVER. IT'S AWESOME.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT'S CONFUSING, WYATT. ALL THE CANDIDATES SEEM THE BELIEVE GOD HAS CALLED THEM TO THIS RACE, SO WHY DOESN'T GOD  JUST TELL US WHO HE SUPPORTS.
OH, SURE, HE COULD JUST SEND US A SIGN, MAYBE PUT NEWT GINGRICH'S FACE ON A POTATO OR  PUT NEWT GINGRICH'S FACE ON A MARSHMALLOW OR PUT NEWT GINGRICH'S FACE IN A BELL OF  TARTAR SAUCE, REALLY GINGRICH GINGRICH'S FACE COULD APPEAR ON ANY STARCHY OR GLOBULAR FOODSTUFF. CHOWDER, OH, IT COULD GO IN CHOWDER.
Jon: YES, BUT WHY IS GOD BEING COY HERE? WHY NOT JUST PUT OUT A YARD SIGN IN FRONT OF THE PEARLY GATE  SAYING, I'M FOR SANTORUM OR I'M FOR GINGRICH AND SETTLE THE WHOLE DAMN THING ONCE AND FOR  ALL IN
I DON'T KNOW, WHY DOESN'T HE SETTLE JUDYISM VERSUS CHRISTIANITY VERSUS ISLAM? WHY CREATE A LOW-LYING, A PELLOW AND THEN DESTROY IT WITH A TSUNAMI? THE DUDE WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAY.
Jon: HE LOVES THE GAME OF IT ALL.
LOOK AT THIS PLACE. HE'S GOT ACTION ON THIS ALL THE WAY TO THE CONVENTION.
Jon: SO GOD WILL ACTUALLY BE IN TAMPA COME AUGUST?
HAVE YOU BEEN THE TAMPA? THAT PLACE IS A [BLEEPED] HOLE.
Jon: BUT GOD DID CREATE IT.
SERIOUS WAVES, JON.
