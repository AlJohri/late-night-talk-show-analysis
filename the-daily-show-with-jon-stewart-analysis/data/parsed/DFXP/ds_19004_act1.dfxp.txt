FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT THE LOVELY AND TALENTED KERRY WASHINGTON, THE STAR OF SCANDAL, THE SHOW ABOUT A TEAM, THEY LOVE THE SCANDAL. AS MANY OF THEM KNOW, A SHOW ABOUT A TEAM OF COMPETENT PROFESSIONALS IN OUR NATION'S CAPITOL. IT'S-- FICTION. I GUESS OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TONIGHT AS WE HAVE BEGUN FOR THE PAST THREE NIGHTS. WITH OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF-- SHUTSTORM 2013! WITH OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF-- SHUTSTORM 2013!
Jon: ALL RIGHT, IN THE PAST FEW DAYS YOU MAY HAVE DEVELOPED AN IMPRESSION THAT NOTHING WORKS ANY MORE, NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN BUT THE HEALTH CARE EXCHANGES THAT SHE SHUTDOWN WAS SUPPOSED TO PREVENT ARE ALSO, WELL, SHUTDOWN. BUT I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THERE IS ONE ORGANIZATION CURRENTLY WORKING AT PEAK EFFICIENCY, LOCATED IN A SMALL HAMLET AND THAT PLACE IS KNOWN AS BULL [BLEEP] MOUNTAIN. SEE, OVER ON BULL [BLEEP] MOUNTAIN THEY-- OH. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT HAD COME UP. OVER ON BULL [BLEEP] MOUNTAIN THEY REALIZE THAT THIS SHUTDOWN AIN'T LOOKING SO HOT FOR ONE PARTICULAR POLITICAL PARTY.
ACCORDING TO THE MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER NETWORK EVENING NEWS STORIES OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAVE BLAMED THE GOP 21 TIMES AND BLAMED DEMOCRATS NONE.
Jon: AND THEY'RE ALSO BLAMING FLOODS ON WATER. NOT FIRE. AND SUNSETS ON THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH, NOT GIANT FEATHERED SERPENTS WHO DEVOUR THE SUN AT NIGHT. YES, IT APPEARS DURING THE SHUTDOWN FACTS ARE MATTERING. WELL, WE CAN'T HAVE THAT. TO THE BULL [BLEEP]-NATOR.
WE ARE SEEING FIRSTHAND THE DEVASTATING IMPACT THIS LIBERAL SHUTDOWN IS HAVING-- .
Jon: LIBERAL SHUTDOWN, HMMMM. THE FECES IS STRONG IN THIS ONE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT, SHUTDOWN RELABELED.
VETERANS HAD TO MOVE BARRICADES TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL IN OUR NATION'S CAPITOL.
THE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATS INSISTING ON CLOSING MEMORIALS TO THE PUBLIC.
THE DEMOCRATS, PRESIDENT OBAMA, THIS WHITE HOUSE HAVE DENIED THESE VETS ACCESS. THEY HAVE SHUT DOWN THESE NATIONAL PARKS. THEY ARE DOING IT ALL DELIBERATELY TO INFLICT MAXIMUM PAIN ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Jon: YEAH, OF COURSE THEY ARE. COULD THERE BE A HIGHER OCTANE FUEL FOR FOX NEWS FALSE OUTRAGE EXPLOITATION ENGINE THAN WHEEL-CHAIR BOUND WORLD WAR II VETERANS. THERE IS-- MAYBE A FETUS THAT OWNS A SMALL BUSINESS AND THAT SMALL BUSINESS MAKES MERRY CHRISTMAS MUZZLE COZIES. THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY OUTRAGE. THEY WILL STORM THE BARRICADES TO MAKE SURE THESE MAYBE 100 VETERANS GET INTO THE MEMORIAL WHILE FORGETTING IT'S THEIR ALLIES ASSANINE BUDGET SHENANIGANS THAT NOT ONLY SHUT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT ALSO PUT MEALS ON WHEELS AT RISK, A PROGRAM THAT SERVES MEALS TO OVER 500,000 VETERANS A YEAR. SO UNLESS THAT WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL IS MADE OF FOOD--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOTE TO SELF. (LAUGHTER)  THAT ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR THE SEPARATE SNACK BAR. THAT'S WHY--  (LAUGHTER) OUTRAGE FROM BULL [BLEEP] MOUNTAIN CAN ALMOST NEVER BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.
GOVERNMENT IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM, GOVERNMENT IS THE PROBLEM.
GOVERNMENT CONTROL HURTS THOSE STRUGGLING TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM.
IT IS LONG OVERDUE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY.
MAKE GOVERNMENT SMALLER.
THE BEST GOVERNMENT IS THE SMALLEST GOVERNMENT.
GET GOVERNMENT OUT OF OUR LIVES. GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF OUR LIVES.
GET GOVERNMENT OFF OF OUR BACKS.
WE WANT LESS GOVERNMENT.
IF ONLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD LEAVE US ALONE.
Jon: I KNOW! (LAUGHTER) SEE, YOU HATE THE GOVERNMENT. YET YOU WAIL LIKE BANSHEES IF ANY OF THE SERVICES AND BENEFITS YOU LIKE ARE TAKEN AWAY. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE? YOU'RE THE JERK.
I DON'T NEED THIS STUFF. AND I DON'T NEED YOU. I DON'T NEED ANYTHING. EXCEPT THIS, THIS PADDLE GAME. THE PADDLE GAME, THAT'S ALL I NEED. AND THIS.
Jon: I DON'T NEED ANY GOVERNMENT, EXCEPT THESE MEMORIALS, AND SOCIAL SECURITY, AND THE PADDLE GAME. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: AND THEN, IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR OUTRAGE AND SADNESS OVER THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, YOU'LL ALWAYS END UP GIVING AWAY THE BULL [BLEEP] GAME.
WE'RE REALLY VERY ENERGIZED TODAY, VERY STRONG. THIS IS ABOUT THE HAPPIEST I'VE SEEN MEMBERS IN A LONG TIME.
YES, THERE IS JOY ON BULL [BLEEP] MOUNTAIN THIS DAY. FOR THE GOVERNMENT IS SHUT AND THE PHOTO OPS BE PLENTIFUL. AND YOU ALMOST HAVE TO ADMIRE HOW FULLY THEY CAN COMMIT TO THEIR MEMES.
WE HAD A SPLITSCREEN THERE WITH BENGHAZI AND IT TURNS OUT IT LOOKS AS IF MORE PERSONNEL WERE SENT INTO THE WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT THAN THE STATE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY SENT TO BENGHAZI.
Jon: YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T BEEN A DIRECTOR FOR VERY LONG AND I HATE TO CRITICIZE PERFORMANCES. CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO GIVE A LINE READING BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THE NEWS FACE YOU WANT TO USE TO CONVEY OUTRAGE AND CONCERN ISN'T [BLEEP] EATING GRIN. (LAUGHTER) THE GRATUITOUS AND CAVALIER NATURE OF THAT COMPARISON TRULY SHOWS HOW LITTLE THEY ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT BENGHAZI EXCEPT AS A BEN-GOTCHA, TRADEMARK, I'M GOING TO TRADEMARK THAT, YEAH, NICE. YOU KNOW WHAT, I CAN'T-- I CAN'T EVEN STAND TO TALK ABOUT THERE ANY MORE FOR THE SAKE OF MY SANITY AND THE SAKE OF YOUR SANITY. LET'S STOP TALKING ABOUT IT AND GO OUT TO A LONG TIME FEDERAL EMPLOYEE WHO HAS SEEN THE EFFECTS OF THIS SHUTDOWN FIRSTHAND. LET'S GO ASK HIM NOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US MR. BEAR, WE APPRECIATE IT.
