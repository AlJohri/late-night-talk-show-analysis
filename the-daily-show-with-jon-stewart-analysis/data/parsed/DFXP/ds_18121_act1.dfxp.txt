FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. I AM JOHN OLIVER. STILL HERE FOR JON STEWART WHO  IS CURRENTLY IN MOSCOW OR  ECUADOR OR ON A FLIGHT SOMEWHERE OR ESCAPED FROM THE NATIONAL  ZOO. WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, ACTRESS MAGGIE  GYLLENHAAL IS HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT FIRST, BUT FIRST TONIGHT,  MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY,  MONEY! YOU MIGHT REMEMBER FIVE YEARS  AGO WHEN BANKS NEARLY DESTROYED  THE WORLD. DO YOU REMEMBER THINKING, I  COULDN'T GET ANY MORE PISSED OFF  AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAN I AM RIGHT NOW. WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET [BLEEP].
BOMBSHELL EMAILS REPORTEDLY  SHOW HOW TWO BIG CREDIT RATING  AGENCIES ACCEPTED CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR GREEN-LIGHTING THE  RISKY PRACTICES THAT GOT US INTO  THIS LONG MESS. ONE S&P OFFICIAL REPORTEDLY  EMAILED, "LET'S HOPE WE ARE ALL  WEALTHY AND RETIRED BY THE TIME THIS HOUSE OF CARDS FAULTERS."  AND ANOTHER QUOTE, "LORD HELP  OUR EXPLETIVE SCAM. THIS HAS TO BE THE STUPIDEST  PLACE I HAVE WORKED AT."
John: BY THE WAY JUST  INCIDENTALLY I'M GUESSING THAT'S  NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE SMITH HAS HAD TO SAY, "THIS HAS  TO BE THE STUPIDEST PLACE I'VE  EVER WORKED AT." BUT NOW, LOOK, LOOK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD HIM DURING  THAT REPORT SAY CREDIT RATING  AGENCIES ACCEPTED CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR TRIPLE-A RATINGS. THAT MIGHT SOUND TO YOU LIKE A  BRIBE WHEN ACTUALLY IT'S MUCH  WORSE THAN THAT. IT'S STANDARD BUSINESS PRACTICE. AND DON'T TAKE THAT FROM A  POLITICAL IS A TIRIST. TAKE IT FROM A SATIRICAL  POLITICIAN.
THE "WASHINGTON POST" DEPICTS  THE PROBLEM QUITE WELL IN THIS  SATIRICAL CARTOON. NOW HERE YOU SEE THE RATING  AGENCIES GIVING THREE TENs TO  A FIGURE SKATER LABELEDDED WALL  STREET. HE SAYS, "I PAY THEIR SALARIES."  THAT'S WHY HE'S GETTING THE  THREE TENs OR TRIPLE-A. AND, YES, HE'S A FIGURE SKATER  AND HE'S DUMPING TRASH REALLY. THERE YOU SEE AN APPLE CORE. THERE'S A FISH. HEAD. SKELETON. A BANANA. YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE DO ON THE  ICE. YOU JUST DON'T WANT THAT. THAT'S BAD.
John: HOW DO YOU NOT LOVE  THAT? AL FRANKEN HAS CRACKD THE CODE  ON HOW TO TALK TO SENATORS. AS THOUGH THEY WERE SIX-YEAR-OLD  CHILDREN. NOW, THAT WAS BACK IN 2010 WHEN  SENATOR FRANKEN WAS PROPOSING A  CRAZY NEW SYSTEM WHERE RATING AGENCIES WOULD NO LONGER BE  DIRECTLY PAID BY THE BANKS IN  DEALS THEY WERE RAISING. MOST AMERICANS WOULD SAY THAT  SOUNDS SENSIBLE AND OBVIOUS. WHAT WOULD THE REPRESENTATIVES  OF THOSE AMERICANS SAY?
HOUSE AND SENATE NEGOTIATORS  ARE VOTED TO STRIP OUT SENATOR  AL FRANKEN'S CREDIT RATING AGENCY AMENDMENT.
John: THAT'S. THEY SAY GET THAT [BLEEP] OUT OF  OUR FINANCIAL REFORM BILL. SO FRANKEN DIDN'T GET THE  AMENDMENT BUT HE DID GET THE  NEXT BEST THING. A STUDY BY THE S.E.C. THAT  ULTIMATELY PROVES HE WAS RIGHT  ABOUT THERE BEING A CONFLICT OF  INTEREST. HOW DID THEY COVER THAT? ON THE NATION'S PREMIERE  FINANCIAL NEWS NETWORK?
THE FRANKEN PROVISION, YES,  YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS PROBABLY  NAMED AFTER, REQUIRED THE S.E.C. TO CONDUCT A REVIEW OF THE  FEASIBILITY OF A NEW SYSTEM IN  WHICH A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE UTILITY OR BOARD WOULD ASSIGN  WORK TO THE AGENCIES ON  STRUCTURED PRODUCT RATINGS.
UH? DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANY OF  THAT?
IT'S TOUGH TO MAKE THE JUMP  WITHOUT LIKE THE BILL MURRAY  AMENDMENT.
GRANDE DID IT. THE BILL MURRAY AMENDMENT. YOU KIND OF LAUGH AT THE BILL  MURRAY AMENDMENT.
John: TWO POINTS THERE. FIRST YOU'RE A FINANCIAL  ANALYST. YOUR ONE JOB IS TO UNDERSTAND  STUFF LIKE THIS ARCH EXPLAIN IT  TO US. THAT'S LIKE A PILOT COMING ON  OVER THE P.A. SAYING, OH, THERE  ARE SO MANY BUTTONS UP THERE. HOW DO YOU FLY THIS THING? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TOO MANY BUTTONS. WHO DESIGNED THIS? AND, TWO, IF THE GUY WHO DOES  UNDERSTAND IT USED TO BE A  COMEDIAN, THAT MAKES YOU LOOK BAD, NOT HIM.   ( APPLAUSE )   FORTUNATELY THERE IS ONE PLACE  WHERE BANKING REGULATION HAS  WORKED. JASON JONES HAS MORE.
THE FINANCIAL CRASH OF 2008  BROUGHT A NEW FOCUS ON THE  BEHAVIOR OF WALL STREET. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE  REGULATIONS THAT WERE PROMISED  IN ITS WAKE?
THE LARGEST FINANCIAL  INSTITUTION HAS BEEN DOING  EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT FINANCIAL REGULATIONS DON'T  GET PUT IN PLACE.
THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY IT  SHOULD BE. ACCORDING TO CHAMPIONS OF THE  FREE MARKET, MEN LIKE HEDGE FUND  MANAGER JOHN TOBACCO.
WE DON'T NEED THESE SOCIALIST  FORMS OF REGULATIONS, THE  ELIZABETH WARRENS OF THE WORLD COMING DOWN AND STICKING THEIR  LITTLE FINGERS AND MICROMANAGING  THE CAPITAL MARKETS.
IF THOSE WOMEN CAME DOWN WITH  THEIR LITTLE HANDS, WHAT WOULD  WE WIND UP LOOKING LIKE?
WE WOULD START LOOKING A HELL  OF A LOT MORE LIKE CANADA.
AND NOBODY WANTS THAT. I SHOULD KNOW. I'M FROM CANADA. A HORRIFIC COUNTRY WHERE THE  FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS HEAVILY  REGULATED BY A CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT OFFICE THAT SETS  RULES ON ALMOST EVERY TYPE OF  TRANSACTION. I RELUCTANTLY TRAVELED BACK TO  TORONTO AND SAT DOWN WITH THE  CEO OF CANADA'S 8th LARGEST BANK TO HEAR HIS TALES OF WOE  ABOUT OVERREGULATION.
THE MODEL OF REGULATION WE  HAVE HAD IN THIS COUNTRY HAS  BEEN A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE STABILITY OF THE BANKING SYSTEM  AND THE STABILITY OF OUR  ECONOMY.
REGULATION DOESN'T WORK. DEFINITELY SLOWS THINGS DOWN  A LITTLE BIT. BUT THE CANADIAN BANKING SYSTEM  HAS NOT HAD A CRASH IN 150  YEARS. OR EVEN LONGER.
NO CRASH. ABSOLUTELY NOT. THE INTERNET BUBBLE. A COUPLE STOCKS MAYBE THAT  WENT DOWN BUT...
MARKET CRASH IN '87. I DON'T THINK IT WAS ONE THAT  CERTAINLY AFFECTED THE BANKING  SYSTEM.
GREAT DEPRESSION? OUR BANKING SYSTEM PERSEVERED  THROUGH THE GREAT DEPRESSION AS  WELL.
A RIDICULOUS CLAIM  SUBSTANTIATED BY NOTHING MORE  THAN FACTS. BUT A REAL CAPITALIST WOULD KNOW  THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
THE AMERICAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM  IS THE LAST BASTION OF  FREE-MARKET CAPITALISM IN THE  WORLD. IT'S THE GREATEST SYSTEM THE  WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.
WHAT ABOUT THE STATISTICAL  EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS OTHERWISE.
WHAT STATISTICAL EVIDENCE. THE 1790 THE U.S. HAS HAD 16  BANKING CRISES AND CANADA HAS  HAD ZERO.
THERE HAVE BEEN BUBBLES AND  BURSTS IN THE U.S., BUT IF  YOU'RE EDUCATED AND YOU'RE PREPARED, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO  PROFIT.
YOU SEE THESE BUBBLES AND  BURSTS ARE JUST A BIT OF  HARMLESS FREE-MARKET FUN.
NOTHING FUN ABOUT PEOPLE'S  HOUSE LOSING 50% OF THEIR VALUE.
BUT YOU CAN MAKE MONEY OFF  THAT.
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE, A VERY  FEW AMOUNT OF PEOPLE, WHO CAN  MAKE MONEY.
THE REST OF THEM [BLEEP] WHO  CARES.
ARE YOU SERIOUS? I WOULD NEVER EVER SAY THAT.
WHY NOT? [BLEEP].
AN OUTRAGEOUS THING TO SAY. SCREW 'EM. NO. OH, MY GOD! SOMEBODY PLEASE TEACH THESE  PEOPLE HOW TO BANK.
WE HAVE A LOT OF PRODUCTS  HERE IN THE U.S. THAT THE  CANADIANS CAN TAKE A HINT FROM, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE,  COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE  OBLIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE WENT OVERBOARD WITH  THEM IT'S STILL A PRODUCT THAT  WORKS.
OVER, UNDER, INSIDE OUTSIDE  LOANS.
NEVER HEARD OF THOSE. A REVERSE SHRINKING  DERIVATIVE.
STILL NEVER HEARD OF IT. UNLIKE AMERICANS, AVERAGE  CANADIANS HAVE BEEN DENIED THESE  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, LEAVING THEM CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT A  BANKER REALLY IS. WHEN YOU SAY THE WORD BANKER,  WHAT COMES TO MIND?
TRUST WORTHY, CONSIDERATE. WHEN I SAY THE WORD BANKER,  WHAT COMES TO MIND?
COCKROACHES. GREEDY LITTLE PRICKS. THEY'RE JUST LIKE AN EXTENSION  OF MY FAMILY.
RELIABLE. BACK STABBING. TRANSPARENT. MONEY GRUBBING. I LOVE CANADIAN BANKS. PIECES OF [BLEEP]. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.
AND THAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM  WITH REGULATION. IT ATTACKS THE PROUD, RICH  CULTURE OF THE BANKER, AN  EXCITING LIFESTYLE OF OFFENSIVE WEALTH THAT SADLY IN SOME PARTS  OF THE WORLD HAS ALREADY BEEN  LOST.
WE HAVE FUN HERE. WE HAVE FUN.
NO, YOU DON'T. WE DO. PROVE TO ME THAT YOU ARE FUN. WELL, PUT ON THE SPOT, I  GUESS I COULD TELL YOU A JOKE.
TELL ME A JOKE THEN. SO A DUCK WALKED INTO A  PHARMACY AND HE ASKS FOR SOME  CHAP STICK. WHEN HE GOES TO PAY HE SAYS, PUT  IT ON MY BILL.
THAT'S NOT A JOKE. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  JELLY AND JAM?
I DON'T KNOW. YOU CAN'T JELLY A [BLEEP] IN  A GIRL'S MOUTH.
ZING. AND YOU CAN'T JAM REGULATION  DOWN A COUNTRY'S THROAT BECAUSE  TO DO SO WOULD BE TO UNDERMINE OUR NATION'S ENTIRE FINANCIAL  PHILOSOPHY.
FINISH THIS GREAT AMERICAN  BANKING MANTRA. GREED IS...
BAD. GREED IS... DANGEROUS. OKAY. I GUESS CANADIAN WALL STREET  VERSION IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. SO, AMERICA, YOU CAN HAVE  REGULATION BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE  PLEPPED TO LIVE IN A WORLD THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS.
THE POINT IS, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, THAT GREED, FOR LACK  OF A BETTER WORD, IS NOT GOOD. GREED IS WRONG. GREED IS NOT A QUALITY THAT  PEOPLE LOOK FOR IN THEIR BANKER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.   ( APPLAUSE )
O CANADA, I'M SO GLAD I LEFT  YOU.
John: THANK YOU, JASON. WE'LL BE R
