Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS A FORMER AMBASSADOR AND U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY TO AFGHANISTAN. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE WARS OF AFGHANISTAN. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROBLEM PETER TOMSEN. HAVE A SEAT.
THANK YOU.
Jon: MY FIRST QUESTION TO YOU IS SIMPLY THIS. REALLY? (LAUGHTER) REALLY?
IT'S PRETTY BIG.
Jon: REALLY?
YEAH (LAUGHTER) DON'T DROP IT ON YOUR TOE.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS, VOLUME 2, WHAT PERIOD OF WARS DOES THIS COVER AND HOW MUCH OF THE AMAZON IS NOW GONE? (LAUGHTER) WHAT PERIOD OF WARS ARE WE DEALING WITH HER.
ACTUALLY IT'S SIX, TWO IN THE 19th CENTURY, ONE IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY, AND THE  REST WITH THE SOVIET INVASION AND AFTERWARDS.
Jon: STARTING IN '79.
RIGHT.
Jon: WHAT IS SO ALLURINGLY INVADABLE ABOUT--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AFGHANISTAN BECAUSE EVERYONE SEEMS TO WANT TO DO IT THEY DON'T HAVE OIL. THEY DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE MINERAL WEALTH, ALTHOUGH I THINK THEY'VE RECENTLY  DISCOVERED THAT. THEY APPEAR TO JUST HAVE A TIGHTLY KNIT GROUP OF TRIBES WHO DON'T CARE FOR BEING INVADED.
EXACTLY. AND IN OUR CASE WE CALLED IT AN INTERVENTION. SOME CALL IT AN INVASION. THE BIG, THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON IS THAT AFGHANISTAN IS THE HIGHLAND OF YOUR ASIA. IF YOU GET CONTROL OF THE HIGHLAND, SPEAKING ABOUT THE OUTER RING OF GREAT POWERS, THEN YOU HAVE ADVANTAGE OVER YOUR NEIGHBORS AND OVER YOUR OPPONENTS.
Jon: BACK WHEN BOILING OIL WAS THE MAIN WEAPON. BUT--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DOES REALLY BEING ABOVE YOUR ENEMIES IN 29 1st CENTURY, DO WE REALLY THINK  I'M ABOVE PAKISTAN, I WIN, YOU KNOW. IS THAT STILL REALLY STRATEGICALLY SO VITAL?
I THINK IT IS. AND YOU ALSO DENY IT TO YOUR OTHER ENEMIES. I MEAN IF YOU CAN CONTROL THE HIGHLAND OR YOU CONTROL AFGHANISTAN, THEN YOU CAN  MAKE IT UNAVAILABLE TO OTHER ENEMIES. AND THE CASE OF PAKISTAN, THEY WANTED TO CONTROL THE HIGHLAND IN ORDER TO EXPORT ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AROUND THE WORLD.
Jon: CAN'T DOW THAT ON A FLAT SURFACE?
NO I THINK YOU NEED MOUNTAINS, YOU NEED CAVES, YOU NEED PLACES TO HIDE.
Jon: IF PAKISTAN-- NOW WE HAD THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF PAKISTAN ON AND HE ASSURED  ME THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ANY OF THIS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IN YOUR RESEARCH YOU CAME ACROSS ANYTHING ON THAT. BUT PAKISTAN IS, COULD HE BE TELLING THE TRUTH THAT PAKISTAN WAS UNAWARE OF THIS. ARE THEY PLAYING A CONSCIOUS DOUBLE GAME? IS THERE A GROUP WITHIN PAKISTAN THAT'S SUBVERTING A LARGER GROUP IN PAKISTAN. WHAT'S HAPPENING? >>.
I THINK IT'S COMING FROM THE PAKISTANI ARMY WHICH ACTUALLY DOMINATES THE STATE  OF PAKISTAN. THAT'S BEEN TRUE SINCE THEY HANGED THE PRIME MINISTER IN 1977 AND TOOK OVER EITHER  DIRECTLY DURING THE DICTATOR DICTATORSHIPS OR THROUGH CIVILIAN GOVERNMENTS, NONE  OF WHICH SERVED OUT THEIR TERM, UP UNTIL NOW. THE MILITARY HAS DOMINATED AFGHANISTAN. AND IT'S THE MILITARY THROUGH THE ISI WHICH IS AS PRESIDENT MUSH AR AV SAID, ISI FOLLOWS ORDERS, PART OF THE COMMAND STRUCTURE AND THEY DO WHAT THE CHIEF OF  THE ARMY STAFF IE PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF, WHEN HE WAS ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF AND DICTATOR, TELL THEM TO DO. SO IT'S NOT ROGUE OUTFITS WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION, IT'S ACTUALLY  A POLICY, A STRATEGY OF THE-- .
Jon: WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. WHEN YOU SAY EXPORT EXTREMIST INTO AFGHANISTAN WHAT IS THEIR STRATEGIC  ADVANTAGE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING THAT IS EASILY CONTROLLABLE AND IT  GETS IT THAT AREA INVADED.
ACTUALLY, ACTUALLY THERE'S-- THERE'S TWO AREAS OF ADVANTAGE. ONE THE DOMESTIC IN PAKISTAN. THE MILITARY IS ABLE TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE PAKISTANI STATE AND KEEP THE SECULAR  DEMOCRATIC PARTIES OUT OF POWER. THE SECOND IS TO KEEP A LARGE MILITARY BUDGET. THE MILITARY SINCE THEY TOOK OVER HAS GOBBLED UP OVER 50% OF THE MILITARY OF THE TOTAL BUDGET. THAT MEANT EDUCATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE HAS GONE DOWNHILL. AND FINALLY THERE IS-- .
Jon: SORRY, YOU SAID TWO. YOU SAID TWO.
OH, SORRY.
Jon: YOU CAN'T-- NO, TWO.
I'M FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
Jon: WHAT IS THE THIRD.
I'M FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
THE THIRD ONE IS ACTUALLY IT'S FOUR--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU CAN GIVE ME FOUR FOUR-- BUREAUCRACY LET'S HAVE FOUR.
WELL, OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE. DEFENSIVE TO BUILD DEFENSIVE SORT OF DEPTH AGAINST INDIA, HINDU INDIA, ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS DEFENSIVE DEPTH. AND OFFENSIVE IN TERMS OF SORT OF SOWING THE SEEDS OF GLOBAL TERRORISM WITH PEOPLE  LIKE OSAMA BIN LADEN WHO WAS PROTECTED BY THE MILITARY.
Jon: BUT IS THIS THE GRAND BARGAIN SAUDI ARABIA HAD MADE AND FOUND OUT DID  NOT WORK THAT WELL FOR THEM, WHICH IS IF WE TRY AND CONSOLE THE MILITANTS AND GIVE THEM CERTAIN THINGS THAT THEY WANT AS A GRAND  BARGAIN TO KEEP AWAY FROM US, IS THAT WHAT THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO DO OR IS IT THAT THEY ALSO BELIEVE IN THE SAME GOALS?
THEY ALL BELIEVE IN THE SAME GOALS BUT THEY DON'T, THEY TURN AGAINST THEIR MASTERS. IT'S LIKE SNAKES. YOU CAN'T TRAIN SNAKES WHOM NOT TO BITE. AND THE SNAKES STARTED BITING SAUDI ARABIA AND THE BOMBS STARTED GOING OFF IN SAUDI ARABIA. AND THE MONARCHY DIDN'T LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO STAY IN POWER. NOW THE PAKISTANI TALIBAN WHO IN THE EYES OF PAKISTAN ARE ARE THE BAD --  EXTREMISTS, THEY HAVE TURNED AGAINST THE PAKISTANI STATE.
Jon: SO THERE ARE EVEN A SPECTRUM EVEN WITHIN THE EXTREMIST WORLD.
JAKES.
YEAH JRZ I THINK WE ALL KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THEY CAN BE. THE WARS OF AFGHANISTAN. IT'S ON BOOK SHELVES NOW. OR YOU CAN JUST MAKE IT INTO A BOOK SHELF. IT PETER TOMSEN.
