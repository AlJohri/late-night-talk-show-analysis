( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST'S LATEST FILM IS CALLED "KILL THE MESSENGER."
WE KNOW YOU WERE IN NICARAGUA. WE KNOW YOU SAW MENESES.
AM I BEING FOLLOWED?
SPINNING A WEB. SOME GOVERNMENTAL INFORMANTS ARE SCUMBAGS.
LOOK, I WAS UNDER IMPRESSION THAT YOU GUYS HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME, BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, NO. MY ANGLE IS THAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT KNEW DRUGS WERE PUT ON THE STREETS TO TO FUND AN ILLEGAL WAR.
NO. WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY HAPPENED NEVER HAPPENED.
THEN WHY AM I HERE?
AMERICAN KIDS WERE GOING TO DIE IN IT THAT WAR.
AMERICAN KIDS DID DIE AND ARE STILL DYING, JUST NOT THE ONES YOU CARE ABOUT, APPARENTLY.
Jon:  PLEASE WELCOME JEREMY RENNER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). YOUNG MAN!
YOUNG MAN.
Jon: I GOTTA TELL YOU-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ALL RIGHT! HEY, HEY, HEY!
Jon:  EAT IT UP! EAT IT UP!
THIS IS AWESOME.
Jon: THIS STORY --
THIS IS NICE.
Jon:  THIS STORY A BARN BURNER.
THIS IS.
Jon:  THESE ARE THE TYPES OF MOVIES I LOVE BECAUSE IT EXPOSES A STORY THAT EVEN NOW IS NOT WELL KNOWN.
RIGHT.
Jon:  FOR AMERICANS. THIS IS ABOUT A JOURNALIST NAMED GARY WEBB.
YEAH, YEAH. I GREW UP LIKE 70 MILES FROM WHERE THIS HAPPENED. MIND YOU, HE'S WRITING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED 10 YEARS PRIOR TO WHEN HE WROTE IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO NOT TO CALL IT OLD NEWS, BY ANY MEANS, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, IT TOOK A LOT OF DIGGING TO FIND.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT, AND I'M FROM ODESSA, CALIFORNIA, AND HE WROTE THIS IN SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOSE. I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND I HAD SAN JOSE AS MY LOCAL PAPER. I WAS LIKE IT'S SO WEIRD, WHY DIDN'T I KNOW, I WAS ALSO YOUNGER. MAYBE I DIDN'T CARE. BUT THEN, YOU KNOW, IT JUST KIND OF WENT AWAY.
Jon:  EXACTLY.
YEAH.
Jon: SO THIS GUY UNCOVERS THIS IDEA THAT THE C.I.A. IS INVOLVED IN THE NICARAGUAN CIVIL WAR ON THE SIDE OF THE CONTRAS.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND ALLOWING DRUG DEALERS ACCESS TO SELLING DRUGS IN THE UNITED STATES SO THAT MONEY CAN BE FUNNELED INTO THEIR MILITARY.
RIGHT BECAUSE CONGRESS WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH FUNDING THAT WAR.
Jon:  ANYMORE.
YEAH.
Jon: BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN DOING THAT.
YES.
Jon:  EXACTLY. BASTARDS. THOSE BASTARDS.
THEY ALREADY WENT DOWN THAT ROAD. YES EXACTLY.
Jon:  WEBB PUBLISHES THIS IN A SMALL NEWSPAPER IN SAN JOSE.
YES.
Jon: AND THEN THE WORLD EXPLODES ON HIM.
EXPLODES IN A GOOD WAY AT FIRST BECAUSE WHEN THE INTERNET FIRST CAME OUT, THIS IS WHEN IT-- VIRAL WASN'T EVEN REALLY A WORD AT THAT POINT.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT REALLY EXPLODED, LIKE A MILLION HITS A DAY IT WAS HAPPENING IN 1995, MIND YOU. SO IT REALLY STARTED TAKING OFF, AND IT CREATED.
Jon: RIGHT.
NOT RIOTS, BUT A LOT OF UPROAR IN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY --
WELL THE IDEA FOR THEM, TOO, IS THAT, SO THE GOVERNMENT IS FLOODING OUR COMMUNITIES-- THIS IS IN THE MIDDLE OF, YOU KNOW, THIS CRACK EPIDEMIC IN THE 80s.
RIGHT.
Jon: FLOODING OUR COMMUNITIES WITH THESE DRUGS AND KILLING OUR KIDS AND NOT CARING.
RIGHT, RIGHT. BUT THE SPIN ON IT WAS, YOU KNOW, GARY WEBB WASN'T SAYING THAT. THE MOVIE IS ABOUT ULTIMATELY WHAT HE SAID AND THEN WHAT THE MEDIA SPUN IT TO BE.
Jon: EXACTLY.
TO DISCREDIT HIM, WHICH ENDED UP BEING HIS DOWNFALL, WHICH ANY JOURNALIST WOULD HAVE. IF YOU'RE DISCREDITED, YOU'RE DONE.
Jon:  THAT'S THE CRAZY PART.
YEAH.
Jon: SO, YOU CAN IMAGINE THE GOVERNMENT PUSHES BACK ON IT. I MEAN, WE STILL HAVE THAT TODAY.
SURE, SURE.
Jon:  THE FACT THAT THE MEDIA PUSHED BACK ON HIM IS THE PART THAT'S SO INSANE.
YEAH.
Jon: HIS OWN PAPER PUSHES BACK ON HIM, WRITES AN EDITORIAL DISCREDITING HIM.
YEAH. I THINK, I THINK ULTIMATELY, THEY BIT OFF MORE THAN THEY COULD CHEW. JUST BEING A SMALLER PAPER.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND NOT USED TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF HEAD WIND THAT THEY GOT.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND SO THEY SORT OF HAD TO BACKTRACK.
Jon:  SMASH CUT TO THE C.I.A. RELEASES PAPERS IN '98 SAYING, WELL, HE GOT SOME OF IT RIGHT.
YEAH.
Jon: HE DIDN'T GET THE WHOLE THING RIGHT.
YES.
Jon: HE GOT A LITTLE BIT RIGHT. IT WAS A LITTLE BIT RIGHT. YEAH, WE PUT SOME DRUGS THERE. IT'S ALL FINE.
YEP.
Jon: AND THEN THE HOUSE ADMITS IN CONGRESS. YEAH, HE ACTUALLY GOT A LOT OF IT RIGHT RIGHT, LOT OF IT RIGHT.
RIGHT. YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: BY THIS POINT, HE'S RUINED.
HE'S ALREADY RUINED BY THAT POINT, YEAH, AND A LOT OF THINGS WERE HAPPENING AT THAT TIME SOCIALLY THAT WERE MORE INTERESTING, LIKE THE MONICA LEWINSKY SCANDAL WAS HAPPENING, AND THAT'S WHEN, YOU KNOW, THE C.I.A. RELEASES A REPORT THAT, YOU KNOW, GARY WAS RIGHT BY THE WAY BUT THAT JUST GETS BURIED.
Jon: RIGHT.
BY, YOU KNOW --
Jon:  THAT'S WHERE THE PHRASE WAGGING THE DICK COMES FROM. NO WAGGING THE --
WAGGING THE DICK
Jon: WAGGING THE SOMETHING.
YEAH. SMOKE AND MIRRORS, BABY.
Jon:  SO, SO ULTIMATELY, IS THERE ANY RESIDUAL EFFECT FROM THIS STORY OR IS IT ONE OF THOSE THAT JUST WE CONTINUE TO REPEAT THAT SAME-- THAT SAME ERROR?
WHAT IS THE RESIDUAL EFFECT? I MEAN, THE DOWNSTREAM OF IT IS COMMUNITIES --
Jon: RIGHT.
IN, YOU KNOW, ACROSS AMERICA. BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY, WHAT'S RELEVANT TODAY AND IT STILL HAPPENS, DOESN'T IT, THE TAKEAWAY FOR ME DOING THIS MOVIE AND PUTTING THIS THING TOGETHER IS REALLY JUST THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND WE NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE GARY WEBB THAT HAVE THE NUTS TO GO OUT AND DIG AND GIVE ( BLEEP ).
Jon: IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY.
YEAH.
Jon: AND REALLY WELL DONE BY YOU GUYS. AND VERY APPRECIATED IT. SO NICE JOB, MAN.
THANKS, BROTHER.
Jon:  "KILL THE MESSENGER," OPENS IN SELECT CITY ON THE MORROW. IT'S GOING TO BE TOMORROW.
TOMORROW, YES.
Jon: AND YOUNG JEREMY RENNER IS GOING TO BE IN IT, SO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
