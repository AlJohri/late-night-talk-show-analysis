( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE STAR OF THE FABULOUS MOVIE "BOYHOOD."
DO YOU STILL LOVE DAD?
I STILL LOVE YOUR FATHER, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WAS HEALTHY FOR US TO STAY TOGETHER.
WHAT IF AFTER WE MOVE HE'S TRYING TO FIND US AND HE CAN'T?
THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM. HE CAN CALL GRANDMA, AND SHE'LL TELL HIM. HE CAN CALL INFORMATION. WE WON'T BE HARD TO FIND.
IS HE STILL IN ALASKA?
THAT'S WHAT YOUR UNCLE SAYS.
PROBABLY TAMING POLAR BEARS OR SOMETHING.
YEAH, WELL, I HOPE THEY'RE TAMING HIM.
Jon:  PLEASE WELCOME ELLAR COLTRANE. ( APPLAUSE ) THANKS FOR JOINING US. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jon:  YOU ARE A LOCAL FELLA.
BORN AND RAISED.
Jon:  BORN AND RAISED HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THEY APPLAUD YOU LIVING HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) FIRST OF ALL, YOU CONTINUE TO GET OLDER.
I DO. IT'S LIKE EVERY DAY I THINK, IT'S THE END, AND THEN I'M OLDER.
Jon:  IT JUST KEEPS GOING. WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION-- ARE YOU WORKING ON A SEQUEL? ( LAUGHTER )
THIS IS THE FIRST SCENE.
Jon:  THIS IS THE FIRST SCENE OF THE NEW SEQUEL. DID YOU KNOW, SO YOU STARTED THIS -- HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU STARTED THIS?
I WAS SIX WHEN I WENT TO THE FIRST AUDITION, I WAS SEVEN WHEN WE STARTED FILMING.
Jon: WERE YOU AWARE -- NOW, TIME, OBVIOUSLY, WHEN YOU'RE THAT AGE, DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, BUT, LIKE, YOU'RE JUST GETTING USED TO OBJECT PERMANENCE I THINK AT THAT POINT. ( LAUGHTER ) WAS THERE EVER -- THIS IS A 12-YEAR PERIOD. WAS THERE EVER A MOMENT WITHIN THAT THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT DOING IT THIS YEAR? THIS IS THE YEAR I'M NOT DOING IT.
YOU KNOW, NOT REALLY. I WAS CERTAINLY APATHETIC, YOU KNOW, AT A CERTAIN POINT. I THINK, BUT IT WAS ALWAYS A LOT OF FUN. I ALWAYS REALLY ENJOYED IT. YOU KNOW, I KIND OF AM EXPRESSING MYSELF IS REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT HAS EVER MADE ME HAPPY AND I THINK IT WAS ALWAYS, YOU KNOW, A GREAT OUTLET TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF EXPLORE WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH, YOU KNOW, THROUGH THIS SORT OF FICTIONAL UNIVERSE.
Jon:  WOULD YOU TALK TO RICK? WOULD HE TALK TO YOU, ABOUT, HEY, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, AND YOU WOULD TRY AND WEAVE IN WHAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING IN YOUR LIFE WITH WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE STORY?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, WE WERE ALWAYS KIND OF IN TOUCH AND DOING EXACTLY THAT, YOU KNOW, JUST COMPARING KIND OF THE IDEAS THAT RICK HAD, YOU KNOW, WHICH WERE VERY MUCH FROM HIS CHILDHOOD AND, YOU KNOW, KIND OF ETHAN'S EXPERIENCES, AND THEN COMPARE THAT TO WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH, AND SEE WHERE, YOU KNOW, THE TWO KIND OF INTERSECTED.
Jon: WAS THERE EVER A POINT IN THE PROCESS WHERE YOU THOUGHT THIS COULD IMPRESS PEOPLE? ( LAUGHTER ) LIKE GIRLS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND YOU'D SAY TO YOURSELF, LIKE YOU'D SAY TO THEM LIKE, "YOU KNOW, I'M IN A MOVIE?" AND THEY'D BE LIKE, "OH, REALLY? WHEN WILL IT BE OUT?" "10 YEARS." YEAH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, WAS THERE EVER THAT LIKE, "COME ON, LET'S FINISH THIS THING!"
YEAH, I MEAN, I KIND OF STOPPED TALKING REALLY ABOUT IT TO PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST SO ABSTRACT.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND SO KIND OF, YOU KNOW, IT TAKES A GOOD 10 MINUTES TO REALLY GET THE CONCEPT ACROSS AND PEOPLE'S EYES GLAZE OVER, AND THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE YOU'RE IN A MOVIE BUT EIGHT YEARS, I MEAN WHAT IS THAT?
Jon: RIGHT. EXACTLY.
IT'S HARD TO REALLY COMPREHEND IT EVEN AS REAL WHEN IT'S, YOU KNOW, A DECADE OUT STILL.
Jon:  EVEN THEN, YOU KNOW, TO SEE IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, WERE YOU WATCHING THROUGH THE PROGRESSION OR DID YOU NOT SEE IT AND THEN ALL IN ONE FELL SWOOP, WHEN IT WAS DONE THEY, SAT YOU DOWN AND THEY SHOWED IT TO YOU?
YEAH, YEAH I WAITED UNTIL THE END.
Jon:  I CAN'T IMAGINE-- IT WAS A VERY EMOTIONAL MOVIE FOR ME TO WATCH BECAUSE I HAVE A SON AND WAS ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) I ASSUME.
RIGHT, THAT'S THE STORY.
Jon:  THAT'S THE STORY I'VE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE. AS THE INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED, DO YOU FEEL DISASSOCIATED? WAS IT EMOTIONAL IN THE SENSE OF WATCHING YOURSELF THROUGH THAT PROCESS? DO YOU RECOGNIZE YOURSELF AS A YOUNG BOY IN THAT? WHAT'S THE FEELING?
YEAH, I MEAN, THE FIRST-- THAT FIRST TIME I WATCHED IT, I WATCHED IT ALONE BEFORE SUNDANCE, AND IT WAS. IT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT MYSELF. YOU KNOW, I WAS KIND OF ALMOST UNAWARE OF THE REST OF, YOU KNOW, THE STORY AND ALL OF THAT. IT WAS VERY MUCH JUST ABOUT WATCHING MYSELF GROW UP, AND YOU KNOW, CHANGE PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND KIND OF SEEING THESE DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW, PARTS OF MY LIFE THAT WERE PROJECTED ON THE SCREEN. AND, BUT SINCE, I'VE SEEN IT SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN, AND IT'S BECOME EASIER TO, YOU KNOW, KIND OF TAKE MY EGO OUT OF IT AND VIEW IT MORE AS A FILM AND MORE OF, YOU KNOW, AN EXPLORATION OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME AND ALL OF THAT, WHICH I THINK IS MORE WHAT IT'S ABOUT THAN --
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PIECE OF ART. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE FILM. I THINK ALMOST MOST IMPRESSIVELY ABOUT IT IS THAT SOMEHOW RICK KNEW WHEN HE MET YOU, THAT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE A DICK.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). LIKE, HE JUST KNEW, THIS IS A GOOD KID, AND I BET HE'S GOING TO BE A GOOD MAN, AND IT REALLY MAKES IT A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT WITH US. AND WHERE SHOULD I GO TONIGHT FOR TACOS?
TORCHES.
TORCHES, I ALREADY HIT THAT. NOW THEY'RE GOING TO START SHOUTING. ALRIGHT. "BOYHOOD." YOU'VE GOT TO GO SEE IT. CURRENTLY PLAYING IN SELECT CITIES. ELLAR COLTRANE, CONGRATULATIONS.
