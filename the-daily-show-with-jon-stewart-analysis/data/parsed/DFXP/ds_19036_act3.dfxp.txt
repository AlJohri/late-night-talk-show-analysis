[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT THE NEW FILM IS CALLED THE HOBBIT THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG.
THE KING HAS NEVER LET ORCS IN OUR LANDS, BUT HE WOULD LET THEM CROSS OUR BORDERS AND KILL OUR PRISONERS.
IT'S NOT OUR FIGHT.
IT IS OUR FIGHT. IT WILL NOT END HERE. WITH EVERY VICTORY THIS EVIL WWILL GROW. IF YOUR FATHER HAS HIS WAY, WE WILL DO NOTHING. WE WILL HIDE WITHIN OUR WALLS, LIVE OUR LIVES AWAY FROM THE LIGHT AND LET DARKNESS DESCEND. ARE WE NOT PART OF THIS WORLD? TELL ME WHEN DID WE LET EVIL BECOME STRONGER THAN US.
Jon: YOU ARE PART OF THIS WORLD. PLEASE WELCOME EVANGELINE LILLY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY'RE BIG FANS. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. ENJOY. VERY, VERY NICE TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GREAT. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE GOLDEN GLOBES.
Jon: YES, CONGRATULATIONS. THANKS FOR ALL MY NOMINATIONS.
Jon: WHAT HAPPENED? I DIDN'T SEE THE GOLDEN GLOBES.
I'M NOT NOMINATED FOR (bleep).
Jon: REALLY?
NO, NO, I'M EXCITED BECAUSE THIS YEAR THE LEADING ACTRESS CATEGORY IS ALL WOMEN OVER 40.
Jon: REALLY? HAS THAT NOT HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY.
IT USED TO BE THE CLICHE WAS AN ACTRESS OVER 40 IS OUT OF WORK.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND NOW AN ACTRESS OVER 40 IS AN AWARD NOMINATED TOP OF HER GAME RESPECTED DAMSEL.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE YOUR MONEY ON ANYONE IN PARTICULAR?
I'VE NOT SEEN MOST OF THEM, BUT I KIND OF HAVE A CRUSH ON CATE BLANCHETT.
Jon: SHE'S ONE OF THOSE ACTRESSES THAT IS WONDERFUL BUT IT ALWAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT. LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE NICHOLSON IN A MOVIE NOW HE'S GREAT BUT IT'S LIKE LOOK AT JACK NICHOLSON ACTING. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BUT WITH CATE BLANCHETT SHE JUST INHABITS WHATEVER IT IS SHE DOES THERE. IS THERE ONE YOU WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH, HAD WORKED WITH?
I WOULD LIKE TO WORK -- I DID A MOVIE WITH CATE AND NEVER WORKED WITH HER FOR A DAY.
Jon: DID SHE REQUEST THAT? IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED? THIS WOMAN IS STALKING ME.
I DID MEET HER ON THE RED CARPET.
Jon: HOW WAS SHE.
SHE WAS TINY. SHE'S WEE. I THOUGHT SHE WAS STATUEESQUE BUT SHE'S WEE.
Jon: MORE WEE THAN ME?
IT'S TOUGH TO BE MORE WEE THAN YOU.
Jon: PEOPLE MEET ME SOMETIMES AND THEY THINK I'M TALL AND THEN THEY MEET ME AND THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN THEIR EYES IS OFTEN PALPABLE.
I GET THE SAME THING, YOU KNOW.
Jon: I THINK YOU ARE TALL.
PEOPLE THINK I'M LARGER THAN I AM. I THINK THE CAMERA PUTS ON A LITTLE TOO MUCH WEIGHT. PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY BUT YOU ARE SMALL. I THOUGHT WAIT, YOU THOUGHT I WAS FAT.
Jon: YOU GET IN FIGHTS? I JUST BACK OFF. THEY SAY I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALLER AND I WAS LIKE ME, TOO. I THOUGHT I WAS TALLER AND YOUNGER. I'M JUST GOING TO GO, I'M GOING TO WALK AWAY.
WALK AWAY.
Jon: HOW LONG WHEN YOU SHOOT THE MOVIES BECAUSE NOW THERE'S A FEW OF THEM HOW LONG DID YOU LIVE THERE?
I LIVED THERE FOR A YEAR. IN NEW ZEALAND. I LIVED THERE A YEAR. THE DWARFS WERE THERE FOR TWO YEARS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IT'S NOT A PHRASE YOU HEAR A LOT.
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. BUT THE DWARFS WERE THERE FOR TWO YEARS. WHY DID THEY HAVE TO STAY? WAS THERE ANOTHER MOVIE THEY WERE DOING OR WERE THEY BEING COMPACTED? I DON'T KNOW HOW PETER JACKSON WORKS. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS A METHOD GUY. [ LAUGHTER ]
HAVE YOU SEEN THE FIRST FILM.
Jon: DID I?
YOU LOVED IT, DIDN'T YOU.
Jon: THREE TIMES. THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT.
HOW DID YOU THINK I WAS IN THE FIRST FILM.
Jon: YOU WERE NOT IN THE FIRST FILM BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS THE PARTS THAT I SAW. I DIDN'T SEE THE FIRST FILM.
I WASN'T IN THE FIRST FILM SO YOU ANSWERED CORRECTLY.
Jon: HERE IS THE THING. I WAS WAITING FOR -- THE WHOLE TIME I WAS SITTING THERE LIKE -- BUT YOUR CHARACTER IS NOT IN THE BOOK. I'M MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE BOOK.
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE PART OF THE BOOK.
Jon: I LIKE WHEN THEY FIND THE RING. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS ALL LIKE OH, THANK GOD. BECAUSE I KNEW THEY NEEDED IT ALTHOUGH FOR A WHILE I WAS LIKE HE IS GOING TO GET MARRIED. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO WITH IT.
WERE BILBO AND GOLLUM GOING TO TIE THE KNOT.
Jon: SETTLE DOWN. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE ELVES GOING FOR ORLANDO BLOOM BUT WHY  DOESN'T GIMLI GET SOME ACTION?
HE HAS A WIFE AND CHILD AND BOTH HAVE A LOT OF FACIAL HAIR.
Jon: REALLY? I HAVEN'T SEEN GIMLI'S CHRISTMAS CARD SO I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT'S HOW THAT WENT. WHY CAN'T ELVES AND DWARFS -- THEY CAN BE FRIENDS BUT WHY CAN'T THEY?
I DON'T KNOW THE ANATOMY OF IT ALL AND HOW THAT WORKS AND FITS TOGETHER BUT MY CHARACTER --
Jon: YOU HAVE A KID?
NOT AN ELF DWARF KID.
Jon: YOU KNOW THE ANATOMY.
THE ANATOMY OF A HUMAN BEING BUT THE ELF DWARF ANATOMY BUT I KNOW MY CHARACTER MIGHT TEST THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT ANATOMICAL COMPATIBILITY AT SOME POINT. IT MIGHT HAVE CROSSED HER MIND.
Jon: IN THIS FILM YOU BANG A DWARF? THIS ONE I'M GOING TO. [ LAUGHTER ] THE HOBBIT IS IN THE THEATERS TOMORROW. IT'S GOING TO CRUSH IT. EVANGELINE LILLY. NICE JOB.
