FOUR YEARS AGO HE MADE US HOPE AGAIN.
YES WE CAN!
NOW HE WANTS TO MAKE US HOPE AGAIN AGAIN. FROM CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, THIS IS THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION, HOPING CHANGE 2. LET'S GET FOOLED AGAIN.
Jon: YEAH, BABY! WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUESTS TONIGHT AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT NOW  LIVING A GLORIOUS AND CARE-FREE LIFE OF DECADENCE AS A TENURED COLLEGE PROFESSOR. BARACK OBAMA, I'M ASSUMING HAS JUST FINISHED HIS SPEECH ACCEPTING THE NOMINATION OF  THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND AT THE END OF IT THREW DOWN HIS MIKE AND SAID [BLEEP] ALL Y'ALL. THAT WAS WEIRD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LET'S BEGIN THE NIGHT WITH NIGHT 2 OF THE DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL CONVENTION WHERE DEMOCRATS ARE CAPITALIZED-- THE PASSIONATE POPULISM OF DEVAL PATRICK. THE LO QUA SHOULDNESS OF UNO E DUAL AND MICHELLE OBAMA WHO CRUSHED IT SO HARD  REPUBLICANS WERE DESPERATE TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
REPUBLICANS ARE NOW BLASTING THE DEMOCRAT'S PLATFORM.
WHY WOULD THEY REMOVE THAT JERUSALEM SHOULD BE THE CAPITAL IMOF ISRAEL.
THE WORD GOD WAS GONE. THE ONE REFERENCE BEFORE, THE REPUBLICANS HAD 12 REFERENCES OF GOD.
HOW THERE CAN BE AN ENTIRE SECTION ON FAITH IF YOU DON'T MENTION GOD WITH. WHAT DO WE HAVE FAITH IN.
I HAVE FAITH IN A GOD WITHOUT ISN'T SO INSECURE HE DOESN'T FREAK OUT IF YOU  DON'T MENTION HIS NAME ENOUGH. GOD IS NOT A MEDIA FIGURE, YOU KNOW. GOD ISN'T LIKE AN INSIDE THE BELTWAY MEDIA FIGURE WHO FIRST THING THEY DO WHEN  THEY GET A BOOK IS CHECK THEIR INDEX FOR THE NAMES. GOD DOESN'T DO THAT THAT IS WEIRD YOU MENTIONED TREES AND SAVING THE EARTH BUT YOU  DON'T MENTION THE GUY WHO CREATED THE WHOLE THING, I MEAN, ALL I'M SAYING IS  WHATEVER, GUYS. (LAUGHTER) THAT WAS MY IMPRESSION OF GOD. (LAUGHTER) AND NOT VERY GOOD. BUT GUESS WHAT, DEMOCRATS AREN'T GOING TO GET SUCKED INTO THAT GAME. DIDN'T YOU HEAR DEVAL PATRICK.
IT'S TIME FOR DEMOCRATIC TO GROW A BACKBONE AND STAND UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE!
Jon: BOOM, AND I MEAN, BOOM. ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY, NOT REALLY HOW BACKBONES WORK. YOU CAN'T JUST GROW ONE FORCE OF WILL. MY POINT IS THIS--  (LAUGHTER) DEMOCRATS AIN'T GOING TO GET DISTRACTED BY YOUR BULL  [BLEEP] PARTISAN WHINING AND REDO A PLATFORM THAT --
MR. CHAIRMAN, I MOVE THAT WE SUSPEND THE RULES TO PERMIT AN AMENDMENT TO THE  PLATFORM ADOPTED BY THIS CONVENTION LAST NIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DO APPROXIMATING? REVERSING YOUR PRINCIPLESES TO APPEAL TO HARD-CORE DEAD-END REPUBLICANS? WHO ARE YOU, MITT ROMNEY? (LAUGHTER) APPARENTLY AT THE URGING OF FOX NEWS, DEMOCRATS DRAFTED LANGUAGE THAT GOD AND  JERUSALEM IS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL BACK IN THEIR PLATFORM.
THE MATTER REQUIRES A TWO-THIRDS VOTE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. ALL THOSE DELEGATES IN FAVOR SAY AYE. ALL THOSE DELEGATES OPPOSED SAY NO.
IN THE OPINION OF THE-- LET ME DO THAT AGAIN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: GOOD IDEA. GOOD IDEA. YOU SHOULD DO THAT AGAIN. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THAT FIRST TIME, IT DIDN'T SEEM TO WORK OUT FOR YOU.
ALL OF THOSE DELEGATES IN FAVOR SAY AYE.
AYE!
ALL THOSE DELEGATE OS POSED SAY NO.
NO!
I GUESS-- I WILL DO THAT ONE MORE TIME.
Jon: WHAT DOW MEAN ONE MORE TIME WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? NO MEANS NO. IT IS DONE.  LET IT GO.
ALL THOSE DELEGATES IN FAVOR SAY AYE.
ALL THOSE DELEGATE OS POSED SAY NO.
NO.
IN THE OPINION OF THE CHAIR TWO-THIRDS OF VOTE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THE MOTION IS ADOPTED.
WHAT?
IT IS SOUNDING TO ME LIKE THE AYES AND NEA WERE VERY CLOSE BUT SINCE PASSING THE  MOTION HAS BEEN PRESCRIPTED-- I CAN ONLY SAY TIE GOES TO THE PROMPTER. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE WE HAVE FINALLY DISCOVERED THE EVIDENCE OF DEMOCRATIC VOTER  FRAUD REPUBLICANS WERE ALWAYS COMPLAINING ABOUT. THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAN, ONE MAN WHO COULD RESCUE THE DAY. THE BIG DOG! 42, MR. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON!
WE ARE HERE TO NOMINATE A PRESIDENT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I WANT BARACK OBAMA TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
FOUR MORE YEARS!
Jon: NO, NO YOU KNOW, I CAN'T, I ALREADY SERVED MY TWO TERMS. NO, I GET IT, I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, MAN, BUT JUST JUST-- THE CONSTITUTION IS  WHAT-- OH, YOU ME-- OH, OKAY. (LAUGHTER) BILL CLINTON FEEDS OFF AN AUDIENCE LIKE SUPERMAN DRAWING POWER FROM THE EARTH. YELLOW SUN. THAT OBLIGATION WILL BE DETERMINED BY THEIR SALARY. THIS WILL CHANGE THE FUTURE FOR YOUNG AMERICANS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHOO! SO AFTER AN INSPIRING BUT TIGHT 35 MINUTES STEM WINDER-- WHAT, THAT WASN'T  THE END, NOW THAT BRINGS ME TO HEALTH CARE.
Jon: 35 MINUTES INTO THIS THING ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO GO TO HEALTH CARE T IS  PAST 11:00 T IS KIND OF A COMPLICATED SUBJECT, BUT HAVE AT IT.
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, ARE WE BETTER OFF BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA FOUGHT FOR HEALTH-CARE REFORM? YOU BET WE ARE.
Jon: THANK YOU, GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY. AND GOD BLESS THOSE OF YOU WHO CAN STILL CATCH THE VERY END OF THE COWBOYS GIANTS GAME ON --
THERE WERE TWO OTHER ATTACKS ON THE PRESIDENT IN TAMPA.
Jon: SON OF A BITCH! (APPLAUSE) WHAT ARE YOU DOING! (APPLAUSE) THIS IS NOT THE EVENT FROM LAST NIGHT THAT I WANTED TO GO INTO OVERTIME. BUT ON HE WENT, THROUGH WELFARE REFORM, MEDICARE, THE NATIONAL DEBT, IMMIGRATION, WITH MORE FAULT ENDINGS THAN A JAMES BROWN CONCERT. THE HARDEST LOVING MAN IN POLITICS. FINALLY YIELDED THE STAGE AROUND 11:30 P.M. EASTERN, PAST MY BEDTIME.
GOD BLESS YOU! AND GOD BLESS AMERICA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: DON'T STOP THINKING ABOUT TOMORROW, KUSES IT'S A HALF HOUR FROM NOW. (LAUGHTER) BUT ALONG WITH PURE STAMINA, BILL CLINTON WEDNESDAY FIGHT BROUGHT SOMETHING TO THIS CAMPAIGN SEASON THAT HAS BEEN MISSING.
CAME FROM A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE STILL THOUGHT 2 AND 2 WAS 4.
Jon: MATH. NUMBERS. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THIS BUT I HAVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH, MATH.
AN AMAZING DISPLAY OF ACTUALLY SAYING STUFF, MORE SPECIFIC NUMBERS IN ONE  SPEECH LAST NIGHT THAN THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP DID IN AN ENTIRE WEEK IN TAMPA.
WHAT HAS THE PRESIDENT DONE. HE HAS OFFERED A REASONABLE PLAN OF FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT REDUCTION  OVER A DECADE FOR EVERY TWO AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING CUTS, HE RAISES  A DOLLAR IN NEW REVENUE,.
Jon: OH RATIOS. MATHEMATICAL PARAMETERS FROM WHICH TO EXTRAPOLATE RESULTS. NOT THAT THE REPUBLICANS DID NOT HAVE A PLAN TO START OFF THE NATION'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.
WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE THIS NATION'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. WE NEED TO STOP SPENDING MONEY WE DON'T HAVE. WE WILL NOT DUCK THE TOUGH ISSUES. WE WILL LEAVE.
AND AS THE LAST RESORT WE WILL USE-- HOW NUMERICALLY DEFICIENT WAS THE ENTIRE RNC. NOT ONLY DID BILL CLINTON OFFER MORE SPECIFICS THAN THE DEMOCRATIC PLAN THAN THE  REPUBLICAN PLAN, HE ENDED UP WITH MORE SPECIFICS OF THE REPUBLICAN PLAN THAN THE REPUBLICANS.
THEY ALSO WANT TO BLOCK GRANT MEDICAID. AND CUT IT BY A THIRD OVER THE COMING TEN YEARS.
IF THEY STAY WITH THIS $5 TRILLION TAX CUT PLAN, IN A DEBT REDUCTION PLAN, THE  ARITHMETIC TELLS US MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WILL SEE THEIR TAX BILLS GO UP AN AVERAGE OF $2,000 WHILE  ANYBODY WHO MAKES $3 MILLION OR MORE WILL SEE THEIR TAX BILL GO DOWN $250,000.
Jon: OH MY GOD. MATH. AND HERE'S WHAT, TO HEAR A GUY MAKE SENT YENT COMMENTS USING NUMBERS ON STAGE, ARE  YOU LIKE IT'S JUST LIKE A BEAUTIFUL MIND. WHEN REALLY, SHOULDN'T IT JUST BE, I DON'T KNOW, A MIND. ROMNEY, RYAN, YOUR REBUTTAL.
WHAT AMERICA NEEDS IS JOBS.
LOTS OF JOBS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND FEWER SNAKES. LOTS OF JOBS, NO SNAKES. ROMNEY 2012. GENTLEMEN, BRING THIS MOTHER  [BLEEP] HOME.
WE WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
IN THE LAST 29 MONTHS, OUR ECONOMY HAS PRODUCED ABOUT 4.5 MILLION PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS.
MY PROMISE IS TO HELP YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
DURING THIS PERIOD, MORE THAN 500,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED UNDER  PRESIDENT OBAMA.
IF WE ARE SERIOUS AND SMART AND WE LEAD, WE CAN DO THIS.
SO WHAT-- REPUBLICANS 24 MILLION, DEMOCRATS 42.
Jon: [BLEEP] MATH WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
