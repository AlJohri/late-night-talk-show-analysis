Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE POLICE  COMMISSIONER OF NEW YORK CITY. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM,  COMMISSIONER RAY KELLY. SIR, HOW ARE YOU SIR? [  APPLAUSE  ] NICE TO SEE YOU. BATMAN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
GREAT TO BE HERE. LONGTIME FAN. DID YOU KNOW? [LAUGHTER] AGAINST THE LAW. JUST A WARNING THIS TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: CUFF IT IT'S THE FUZZ. HOW ARE YOU? THANKS FOR JOINING US. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS. WE DON'T HAVE A TON OF TIME  BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE  FIGHTING CRIME. THE FIRST THING IS GOING TO BE  GUNS. THERE'S A HUGE DISCUSSION ON  GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE  LOBBY GROUPS AND ADVOCACY  GROUPS, NOT A LOT OF LAW  ENFORCEMENT, SEEMS LIKE THEY SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF  DISCUSSION RATHER THAN NOT. IS THERE A REASON FOR THAT THE? IS LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT ALLOWED  OR PERMITTED TO TAKE A PUBLIC  STAND ON WHAT THEY MIGHT FAVOR FOR GUN ISSUE?
THE THINK THE BIG  ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN SPEAKING  OUT ABOUT IT. YOU SAW THE PRESIDENT YESTERDAY  IN MINNESOTA WITH A GROUP OF  POLICE OFFICERS. SO I THINK PARTS ARE ENGAGED,  MAYBE NOT SPEAK AS LOUD AS WE  COULD. CHUCK RAM SI HAS BEEN THE HEAD  OF AGENCY HAS BEEN ARTICULATE  AND OUTSPOKEN. LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS A PERSONAL  CONCERN ABOUT GUNS AND GUN  SAFETY. POLICE OFFICERS, OVER 150 A  YEAR.
Jon: RIGHT.
SHOT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. TOES A MAJOR CONCERN CERTAINLY  IN URBAN AMERICA. THAT'S HOW PEOPLE ARE BEING  KILLED AND POLICE OFFICERS ARE  ON THE ONES THAT CONFRONT PEOPLE WITH GUNS EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY IN THIS CITY  CERTAINLY.
Jon: THEY KEEP SAYING, IT  ISN'T A QUESTION OF ASSAULT  RIFLES, IT'S AN EPIDEMIC OF HANDGUNS IN NEW YORK CITY.
ANY MAJOR CITY QUITE FRANKLY. IT'S A CONCEALABLE WEAPON  KILLING PEOPLE. ASSAULT WEAPONS, I THINK THEY  SHOULD BE ELIMINATED BUT THEY  ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LESS THAN 2% OF THE SHOOTINGS IN THE CITY.
Jon: NEW YORK CITY AND A  LOT OF MAJOR CITIES HAVE  RELATIVELY STRICT HANDGUN LAWS.
RIGHT.
Jon: WHY IS IT THAT THOSE  ARE NOT WORKING TO STEM THE  TIDE? IS IT BECAUSE ANY OTHER PLACE  THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE LAWS ARE  THE ONES FEEDING THEM?
PRECISELY. 90% OF THE GUNS COME FROM OTHER  STATES. THE IRON PIPE LINEUP 95. SOUTHERN STATES FOR THE MOST  PART. YOU CAN HAVE STRICT LAWS HERE. GOVERNOR CUOMO SIGNED PROBABLY  THE STRICTEST LAWS IN THE  COUNTRY. IF EVERYBODY HAD THAT, IT'S  FINE. EVERYBODY DOES NOT HAVE IT AND  AS A RESULT GUNS CAN BE  PURCHASED IN OTHER  JURISDICTIONS.
Jon: CAN YOU TRACE THEM? SAY SOMEBODY BUYS A GUN IN  FLORIDA, SOUTH CAROLINA,  WHEREVER IT'S AND COMING UP 95 TO US. IT'S USED IN A CRIME. WHEN YOU GET THAT GUN ARE YOU  ABLE TO TRACE THAT BACK TO WHERE  THEY BOUGHT IT?
WITH SOME DIFFICULTY. ATF, DOES THAT, BUT THEY ARE  LIMITED. THEY DO NOT HAVE AND CANNOT  HAVE, AS A RESULT OF  CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTION, A  DATABASE THAT DOES THAT SO THEY CALL THE MANUFACTURERS. IT'S A VERY LABORIOUS AND TAKES  A LOT OF TIME TO TRACE A GUN.
Jon: IF WE COULD INSTITUTE  JUST A TRACING FOR THAT, HOW  MUCH WOULD THAT HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WHAT CAN YOU DO  IF YOU FIND OUT -- I HEARD A  STATISTIC THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF ILLEGAL GUNS COME  FROM 1% OF DEALERS. 1% OF DEALERS ARE PLACING SO  MANY OF THESE ILLEGAL GUNS INTO  INNER CITIES.
RIGHT. MAYOR BLOOMBERG FUNDED AN  OPERATION WHERE HE HAD PRIVATE  INVESTIGATORS GO TO VARIOUS STATES AND SEE THEM, FILM THEM  VIOLATING THE LAWS. IF YOU ARE ABLE TO TRACE THEM  MORE ACCURATELY, PERHAPS WE  WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. BUT WOULD IT --
Jon: BLOOMBERG DID THIS? HE FUNDED THIS? WHERE DID HE GET THE MONEY FOR  THAT? [LAUGHTER] IF COULD YOU HAVE ONE THING,  WOULD IT BE A REGISTRY? WHAT WITH BE THE MOST EFFICIENT,  BEST THING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT  TO HAVE OR IS THERE NOT ONE THING IT'S A LARGE -- WHAT WOULD  LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE?
THERE'S NO MAGIC BULLET HERE. THERE'S NO QUICK ANSWER.
Jon: RIGHT.
OR ONE SIZE FITS ALL. I THINK THE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND  CHECKS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THE PRESIDENT SAY MAJOR  PROPONENT OF THAT. IT WILL CUT DOWN ON STRAW  PURCHASES. OVER SIX MILLION GUNS A YEAR ARE  SOLD WITHOUT ANY BACKGROUND  CHECKS. IT WILL CERTAINLY EAT INTO THAT  NUMBER. IS IT THE PAN C.I.A., NO, BUT  KIT MAKE A DIFFERENCE -- IT CAN  MAKE A CONFERENCE.
Jon: THE HOLLOW POINT,  THINGS ONLY USED FOR THE  MILITARY APPLICATION, THOSE ARE THE OTHER THINGS YOU WOULD LIKE  TO BE DONE.
YES. THESE ARE ALL HEAVY LIFTS. IT'S NOT EASY TO DO. IF NEW YORK NEW YORK STATE YOU HAVE TO G  TO A REGISTERED AMMUNITION  DEALER AND YOU NEED A CHECK TO BUY AMMUNITION.
Jon: HAS THERE BEEN ANY  TALK TO ENFORCE THE LAWS AND TO  STEM THE FLOW OF ILLEGAL GUNS, ANY TALK THAT ONCE YOU GET THAT  LIST YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GO HOUSE  TO HOUSE AND TAKE ALL LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WEAPONS, THEIR  GUNS, KNIVES YOU THINK ARE TOO  LARGE, IN KIND OF MALLET AND TAKE THAT SO PEOPLE WILL LIVE  UNDER TYRANNY. HAS THAT BEEN A DISCUSSION?
NO.
Jon: WOULD YOU TELL ME.
YOU'D BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.
Jon: YOU FEEL THERE ARE  EFFICIENT MEASURES TO TAKE THAT  WOULDN'T NECESSARILY OVERSTEP.
THERE ARE 300 MILLION GUNS IN  THIS COUNTRY AND THEY ARE GOING  TO BE THERE. THE SUPREME COURT DECISION  COLUMBIA VERSUS HELLER MAKES  CERTAIN THAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS GOING BE ALIVE AND  WELL.
Jon: AS WELL IT SHOULD BE  BUT WE HAVE TO BE REASONABLE  ABOUT THE ILLEGALALITY. CAN YOU STICK AROUND -- IS THERE  A CRIME GOING ON RIGHT NOW?
I HOPE NOT.
Jon: HOPEFULLY SPIDERMAN OR  BATMAN IS THERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT
