WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  TONIGHT ABC NEWS  CORRESPONDENT IS THE  CO-FOUNDER THE BOB WOODRUFF  FOUNDATION, THE BENEFIT STAND UP FOR HEROES NOVEMBER  8th IN NEW YORK CITY, PLEASE  WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM  BOB WOODRUFF. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HO ARE YOU?
THANK YOU FOR CLAPPING.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THAT'S PRETTY RARE. LET ME ASK YOU FIRST AND  FOREMOST. HOW ARE DOING WITH THE POWER  OUTAGES, WITH THE HURRICANE,  ARE YOU SURVIVORING, DO YOU  HAVE POWER.
NO, WE DON'T HAVE PO WE  WERE. THEY THINK IT MIGHT BE ABOUT  TWO MORE WEEKS IS WHAT I  HEARD. THEY SAID BETWEEN A COUPLE  DAYS OR TWO WEEKS.
WE HAVE, LOOK HOW MANY  FLIGHTS I HAVE UP HERE. WE ARE-- I'M SITTING IN THE  STUDIO, LOOK BEHIND ME, LOOK  AT THAT.
ARE YOU SPOIL.
Jon: LOCK AT THAT SCREEN  IS LIKE FROM THE MUSEUM OF  NATURAL HISTORY.
THEY MISSPELLED THAT ONE.
WE'RE AT A DRIVE-IN.
Jon: WELL, HOPEFULLY  THINGS WORK OUT. BUT THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN. WHAT A GREAT CHARITY  ORGANIZATION THIS IS, HOW  MANY YEARS NOW, WHAT IS THIS  FIVE?
THIS IS THE SIXTH YEAR. YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED I  THINK MOST OF THEM.
Jon: IT'S AN EXCELLENT-- WELL  YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY THE PAY  IS TERRIFIC. THAT'S WHY-- NO, IT IS  GREAT. IT ALWAYS STRIKES ME, THIS  IDEA THAT WE NEED CHARITIES  TO HELP SOLDIERS ONCE  THEY'RE HOME FROM WAR. YOU NEVER NEED CHARITIES TO  SEND-- YOU KNOW THERE IS  NEVER ANY LET'S RAISE MONEY  TO BOMB IRAN. LIKE SOMEHOW WE ALWAYS HAVE  MONEY FOR THAT BUT IT'S  DIFFICULT TO GET MONEY FOR  THIS.
WELL, AND THEN OUR BIG  FEAR THAT WE'VE GOT NOW WITH  THE WARS NOW WINDING DOWN,  ARE WE STILL GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE AWARE ENOUGH ABOUT  WHAT THESE GUYS ARE DOING  AND WHAT THEY ARE FACING  WHEN THEY COME BACK IN THE CIVILIAN WORLD. THAT IS THE HOPE. AND I THINK THEY ARE RIGHT  NOW. BUT WE ARE LOOKING, IRAQ IS  NOW OVERISH.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND AFGHANISTAN IS GOING  TO BE OVER SOMETIME THE END  OF 2014. SO WE ARE ALREADY TOLD THE  TALIBAN WHEN THIS THING  GOING TO BE OVER. NOW HOPEFULLY AMERICANS WILL  REALIZE THAT THIS IS GOING  TO BE GOING ON FOR THE REST  OF OUR LIVES.
Jon: FOR HOWS-- THOUSANDS  AND THOUSANDS OF MEN AND  WOMEN COMING BACK WITH YOU  ARE PARTICULARLY WORK ON BRAIN INJURY, PTSD. THE SILENT AND INADVICEABLE  WOUNDS AS IT WERE.
YEAH, THOSE ARE HARD TO  SEE. THE VISIBLE ONES YOU CAN. AND THEN THOSE THAT COME  BACK WITHOUT REALLY REAL  ISSUE IN TERMS OF MENTAL  HEALTH. BUT THOSE COMING BACK MAY  FIND SOME WORK AS WELL. WE GOT PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS ARE GOING TO END  THEIR CAREER WITHIN THE  MILITARY. AND THEY NEED TO FIND A  LONG-TERM CAREER WHEN THEY  GET BACK. BUT THESE GUYS COME BACK. THEY NEED US.
Jon: AND THE PTSD, WHAT  ARE THE PERCENTAGES OF  PEOPLE THAT YOU FIND, AND  THESE ARE JUST THE PEOPLE THAT WILL COME TO GET HELP. WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THE  TYPE OF NUMBERS THAT YOU ARE  TALKING ABOUT.
YOU'RE TALKING WELL IN  THE 600,000 PLUS, ABOUT  THAT.
Jon: RIGHT.
UP 20, 25% IS THE NUMBER  THAT WE GENERALLY HEARD  ABOUT. YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO  IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE AS  WELL.
RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK. THESE ARE MULTIPLE  DEPLOYMENTS. THESE GUYS GO OVER. THEY'RE NOT HERE FOR ONE  DEPLOYMENT. I KNOW GUYS OVER THERE ON  THEIR 13th DEPLOYMENT. THESE GUYS ARE SPECIAL  OPPOSITE, SHORTER TERM  DEPLOYMENTS. BUT THEY JUST, THEY COME  HOME AND THEY DON'T KNOW  EXACTLY IF THEY ARE GOING  BACK AGAIN. AND THAT'S CREATING PROBLEMS  AND THEY CAN'T ADJUST.
Jon: THE PTSD, TOO, YOU  KNOW, ARE THEY IN A SORT OF  A CATCH-22 IN THAT IF THEY  SEEK HELP FOR PTSD DOES THAT THEN LABEL THEM AND MAKE IT  ALMOST MORE DIFFICULT FOR  THEM ONCE THEY GET THE HELP  THAT THEY NEED, THAT THEY DESERVE, DOES THAT THEN PUT  A STIGMA ON THEM AND HOW DO  YOU HE RAISE THAT AND WORK  WITH THAT WITH EMPLOYERS AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO MY THINK  THESE GUYS ARE PTSD WHEN IT  IS JUST A NATURAL PROCESS.
THE STIGMA IS STILL  THERE. THAT WAS REALLY BAD IN THE  BEGINNING WHEN THE START,  THEY ALMOST ASSUMED NO ONE  EVEN KNEW WHAT A PTSD WAS, OR THAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS  WIMPY TO BE COMING BACK AND  CLAIMING THAT YOU HAVE PTSD. BUT NOW IT CERTAINLY AS MUCH  MORE T IS EASIER TO DEAL  WITH. BUT IN TERMS OF EMPLOYERS,  THEY HAVE SOME CONCERNS  ABOUT PTSZ BECAUSE THEY  AREN'T REALLY ABLE TO  PREDICT WHAT THEY WILL BE LIKE ONCE THEY GET HIRED. BUT EVERY TIME I KNOW  SOMEBODY WITH EXPERIENCE  THAT DO THAT KIND OF HELP,  THESE GUYS, THEY ARE REALLY BLOWN AWAY BY HOW  DISCIPLINED THE GUYS WHEN  THEY COME BACK.
Jon: THE BUSINESSES THAT  WE WORK WITH THAT HAVE HIRED  VETERANS THAT HAVE HAD SAY  EXEMPLARY, LIKE THEIR WORK ETHIC, IT'S DIFFICULT TO  TRANSLATE THEIR ARMY  EXPERIENCE, THEIR WAR  EXPERIENCE TO ALMOST WRITE A  RESUME FOR CIVILIAN LIFE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE ALL  THE SKILLS AND HAVE DONE ALL  THE THINGS AND CAN DO THEM  VERY WELL.
THAT'S THE THING. IF WE GET SOMEBODY WHO IS IN  THE BUSINESS THAT THEY ARE  TO GIVE THEM SOL MENTORSHIP. AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE  DOING NOW.
Jon: A MENTORING PROGRAM.
RIGHT TO TRY TO GET  PEOPLE JUST TO TEACH THEM  ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED IN  TERMS OF SKILL. HOW TO DO THE RESUME,  INTERVOWS, ET CETERA. BUT ALSO TO CONNECT THEM  WITH THEIR CONNECTION. BECAUSE ALL OF US KNOW A  MILLION PEOPLE AND EVERY  INDUSTRY, AND IF SOMEONE  COMES BACK AND SAYS WE WANT TO GO INTO X, Y, WE CAN FIND  SOMEONE.
Stephen: .
