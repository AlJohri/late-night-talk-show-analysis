Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT THE STAR OF THE NEW FILM 12 YEARS A SLAVE.
WE TRAVELING.
SURVIVAL IS NOT ABOUT CERTAIN DEATH. IT'S ABOUT KEEPING YOUR HEAD DOWN.
DAYS AGO I WAS WITH MY FAMILY. NOW YOU TELL ME ALL THAT'S LOST? THAT'S THE WAY TO SURVIVE. I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE. I WANT TO LIVE.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME CHIWETEL EIJOFOR. (APPLAUSE) COME ON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: WAIT A SECOND. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PERFORMANCES IN AN ACTOR'S CAREER THAT IS-- CAN BE LIFE CHANGING. IT'S SO POWERFUL AND SO MAGNETIC. AND I KNOW YOU ARE A HUMBLE MAN AND PROBABLY TOUGH TO TAKE SOME OF THAT COMPLIMENT. BUT DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE PRODUCING THIS PERFORMANCE, DOES IT FEEL SPECIAL AT THE TIME? DO YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT SOMETHING KIND OF WONDEROUS IS HAPPENING?
WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW IN THIS PROJECT YOU ARE JUST-- I WAS TRYING TO GET AS CLOSE TO SOLOMON AS I COULD. I THINK I READ THE SCRIPT. I KNEW WORKING WITH STEVE McQUEEN WOULD BE QUITE AN EXPERIENCE. I LOVED HIS WORK. WHAT A TREMENDOUS FILMMAKER.
I THINK HE IS EXCEPTIONAL AND HE WAS IN THIS. AND YOU SORT OF IN THE END ARE TRYING TO TELL THE STORY, THE STORY OF SOLOMON NORTHROP WAS SO AMAZING TO ME. AND I'D NEVER HEARD A STORY LIKE IT I HAD NEVER SEEN A FILM LIKE IT. I HAD NEVER BEEN-- YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT IS SO INSIDE THIS EXPERIENCE, INSIDE THE SLAVE EXPERIENCE IN THIS WAY. SO MOVING TO ME. SO DAY-TO-DAY I GUESS IF YOU ARE HOPING ANYTHING, YOU ARE HOPING IN THE END IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT. BUT YOU ARE, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO BE WITHIN IT. AND BE-- PRESENT.
AND I IMAGINE STEVE THE DIRECTOR HAS TO PUSH YOU TO GO TO CERTAIN PLACES IN YOUR MIND AND IN YOUR HEART THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PROBABLY PLACE YOURSELF INTO. BUT THE RANGE OF EMOTION, THE TRIALS AND TRIBLATIONS THAT THIS SOLOMON, WHO IS A REAL INDIVIDUAL,  THIS IS BASED ON HIS REAL DIARY OF THIS EXPERIENCE.
YEAH.
TO GO TO THOSE PLACES. IT MUST CHANGE YOU IN SOME WAY.
WELL, STEVE SORT OF ALLOWS IT TO HAPPEN, YOU KNOW. HE KIND OF JUST CREATES A SET WHERE EVERY PERSON, THE CAST, THE CREW, THEY ALL FEEL, THERE IS A LOT OF LOVE ON THAT SET. IT'S LIKE A FAMILY. AND WE WERE ALL THERE TO TRY AND TELL THE STORY AS BEST WE COULD. AND HE CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO PUSH. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY WANTS TO GIVE 100 PERCENT TO ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY WE DO IT. BUT IT'S GREAT TO  HAVE SOMEBODY THAT KIND OF ENCOURAGES THAT AS WELL, WHO ARTICULATES THAT IN A WAY AND STEVE DOES. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS CAST WAS, AND EVERYBODY ON THE CREW WAS JUST SO DETERMINED TO TELL THE STORY IN THE BEST WAY WE COULD.
Jon: INTERESTING TOO, YOU KNOW. HE'S OBVIOUSLY A DIRECTOR FROM ENGLAND. ARE YOU AN ACTOR FROM ENGLAND. IT ALMOST-- I WONDER IF, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT IS THE MOST AUTHENTIC PORTRAYAL OF AMERICAN SLAVERY THAT'S BEEN FILMED. AND YET MAYBE IT TOOK A COUPLE OF PEOPLE FROM ENGLAND TO BE ABLE TO DO IT BECAUSE FOR US, WE WOULD BE LIKE MAYBE WE MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE THIS ONE LITTLE THING RIGHT HERE. WE LOOK KIND OF LIKE ASSES RIGHT HERE. WAS THERE A NONOWNERSHIP OF IT IN TERMS OF IT BEING THE HISTORY OF YOUR COUNTRY THAT HELPED ALLOW YOU TO GO TO THE PLACES YOU HAD TO GO TO?
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I THINK IN THE END WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WAS, MY FIRST INTERACTION WITH SLAVERY WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THE WHOLE UNDERSTANDING OF IT WAS ALWAYS INTERNATIONAL. YOU KNOW, BY DEFINITION IT WAS INTERNATIONAL. AND BOTH PEOPLE FROM AFRICA, INVOLVED AN INTERNATIONAL KIND OF CONCEPT. SO I ALWAYS CAME AT IT FROM THAT ANGLE. MY FAMILY'S FROM NIGERIA AND I, AND THAT IS WHERE, YOU KNOW, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE TAKEN FROM AND SO I ALWAYS HAD THAT IN MY MIND, AND GROWING UP IN BRITAIN IN THE WEST INDIE SLAVE TRADE AND HOW DEVASTATING THAT WAS. SO THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT IT I THINK THAT WE ALL FELT WAS ABOUT A STORY THAT WAS-- THAT INVOLVED EVERYBODY. THAT WAS WIDER THAN ANY KIND OF NATIONALITY IN A SENSE. YOU KNOW THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WAS ABOUT HUMAN DIGNITY. AND HUMAN RESPECT. AND WHAT THOSE THINGS IN THE END REALLY MEAN AND HOW WE ENGAGE WITH THAT. AND OF COURSE AMERICAN, AND THIS IS A VERY SPECIFICALLY AMERICAN STORY, IN THE FACT THAT IT TAKES PLACE IN LOUISIANA. BUT IT ALSO HAD THIS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, THIS SORT OF WIDER IMPLICATION AND IT FELT CORRECT TO TELL THE STORY, IT TOOK A SLIGHTLY, AN ELEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL.
Jon: INTERNATIONAL.
AND WHAT WAS CAPTURED SO BEAUTIFULLY, I THINK BY YOU, THE CAST, THE FILMMAKER, IS THIS IDEA OF THE FRAGILITY OF FREEDOM. THIS GENTLEMAN SOLOMON, THE WONDERFUL MUSICIAN WITH HIS WONDERFUL FAMILY AND IN A MINUTE IT'S GONE. AND HE IS SUDDENLY CAST INTO THIS STRANGE LIMBO. AND THE FRAGILITY OF IT IS ALMOST PART OF WHAT MAKES IT AS HEARTBREAKING AS IT IS.
I THINK THAT'S TRUE. I REMEMBER WHEN I READ THE BOOK THE FIRST TIME IT WAS ALMOST AS IF I HAD JUST HAD THIS, YOU KNOW, I STARTED READING IT AS KIND OF AN OBJECTIVE PIECE. BUT THEN I SLIPPED DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE AND I WAS SO IMMERSED IN THE EXPERIENCE. AND I FELT LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN CONNECT TO ABSOLUTELY ANYBODY. ANYBODY RECOGNIZES THEMSELVES IN SOLOMON, AND WHAT HIS JOURNEY IS AND THE STRUGGLES THAT WE HAVE. AND HOW WE DEAL WITH OUR LIVES IN SOME WAYS. AND WHAT WE CARE ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S A FILM ABOUT LOVE IN THE END.
Jon: WELL, I'M TELLING YOU MAN, THE HUMANITY THAT YOU BRING TO THE ROLE, AND THE JUST NUANCES AND THE LAYERING THAT YOU BRING TO IT IS JUST SLIGHTLY MAGNIFICENT. IT JUST IS I CAN'T CONGRATULATE YOU ENOUGH. IT REALLY IS A BEAUTIFULLY MOVING FILM AND YOUR WORK IN IT AS WELL AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: WE APPRECIATE IT. 12 YEARS A SLAVE. IN THE THEATRES NOW. GO SEE IT.
