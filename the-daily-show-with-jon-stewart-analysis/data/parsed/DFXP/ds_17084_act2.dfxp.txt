(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT OUTRAGE. THIS IS A STORY ABOUT OUTRAGE. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD COMMENTS PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE LAST WEEK ABOUT WHETHER THE SUPREME  COURT WOULD OVERTURN HIS HEALTH CARE LAW.
IT IS AN UNPRECEDENTED STAND OFF, THE PRESIDENT VERSUS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.
IT IS PREPOSTEROUS, AND EVEN A LITTLE SCARY TO HEAR SUCH ABJECT IGNORANCE FROM A  SUPPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR.
I WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO BACK OFF.
Jon: I WOULD TELL HIM, I WOULD SAY... I WOULD SAY TO THE (MUMBLING). WOULD SAY, ZIP YOUR LIP. I WOULD SAY THAT. I REALLY WOULD TELL THEM THAT. I REALLY WOULD. I REALLY WOULD TELL HIM THAT. JUST SO YOU KNOW WE DON'T FORGET THAT BEFORE THE NICKERS GOT ALL TWISTED UP ABOUT THE  SANTITY OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. SOMEONE SPENT A LOT OF A YEAR (BEEP) ON IT.
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LIBERAL ACTIVISTS JUDGES.
WE BELIEVE THE ROLE OF JUDGES IS TO SAY WHAT THE LAW IS NOT WHAT THEY THINK IT  OUGHT TO BE.
IF ONE JUDGE, AN ACTIVIST JUDGE CAN OVERTURN AN ELECTION INVOLVING SEVEN MILLION VOTES, THEN ELECTIONS DON'T MATTER.
Jon: THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE OR AMAZING DEPENDING ON THE ELECTION. EVEN WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT DOES GIVE THE RIGHT SOME HIGH GROUND THEY DON'T KEEP IT  FOR LONG. CASE IN POINT.
NBC TODAY SHOW ENGAGED IN SELECTIVE EDITING AND CLAIMED THE INFAMOUS 911 CALL FROM  POLICE TO GEORGE ZIMMERMAN AS HE WAS TRAILING THE TEENAGER.
THIS GUY LOOKS LIKE HE'S UP TO NO GOOD. HE LOOKS BLACK.
DID YOU SEE WHAT HE WAS WEARING?
YEAH, A DARK HOODIE.
THEY FORGOT THE DISPATCHERS' QUESTIONS.
THIS GUY LOOKS LIKE HE'S UP TO NO GOOD OR ON DRUGS OR SOMETHING. HE'S JUST WALKING AROUND LOOKING ABOUT.
OKAY. THIS GUY, IS HE WHITE, BLACK OR HISPANIC?
Jon: WHAT THE HELL. NBC YOU CUT OUT THE 911 DISPATCHERS' QUESTION. HE WAS ANSWERING A MULTIPLE COURT QUESTION. YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE HE WAS... YOUR EDIT CHANGES EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT. THE SHOW ABOUT REALLY SMART PEOPLE NOT IF YOU EDIT OUT ALEX TREBEK'S ANSWERS.
WHAT IS A SALARIUM?
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT A SALARIUM IS? YOU'RE AN ADULT.
WHAT IS A CUL-DE-SAC.
Reporter: ARE YOU KIDDING ME. A DEAD END STREET WITH A LITTLE LOOP DE LOOP.
WHAT'S THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS.
Jon: IT'S A SCHOOL IN TEXAS. SEE? NOW I THINK JEOPARDY CONTESTANTS ARE JUST MORE ONS. JUST LIKE PEOPLE WHO WATCH THE TODAY SHOW WHO THINK THAT GEORGE ZIMMERMAN IS A BIG RACIST. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF.
A REPORT SAYS AN INVESTIGATION FOUND THE DECISION WAS A BAD MISTAKE BUT  NOT A DELIBERATE ONE.
Jon: I SUPPOSE YOU JUST HIT THE "REMOVE CONTEXT" BUTTON. YOU SCREWED UP. AND SURPRISE, FOX FINALLY HAD SOMETHING TO BE OUTRAGED ABOUT IN THE TRAYVON MARTIN CASE.
HOW COULD NBC DO THIS IN GOOD CONSCIENCE?
IT'S PRETTY APPALLING.
ANYONE WATCHING THAT BELIEVED A RACIAL OVERTONES TO WHAT THIS MAN DID.
I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE DEFINITELY CORRECTED THE MISTAKE ON THE AIR IF THEY  HAVEN'T DONE SO.
SO MANY REPORTERS DREW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT GEORGE ZIMMERMAN BASED ON WHAT THEY HEARD.
Jon: NOW YOU JUST BLEW IT. IF THERE'S ONE PERSON WHO IS A EXPERT ON A JOURNALIST DOCTORING HER FACTS. STORY AFTER STORY ON IRAQ'S PRESS ABOUT WMDS. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE WE INVADED IRAQ. ALL RIGHT. COME ON, GUYS. FOX HAD THE MORAL HIGH GROUND. WHY NOT QUIT WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD.
ANOTHER ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT THIS WAS NBC WHICH DID THIS. MS-NBC HAS BEEN REALLY A KIND OF PROMOTER OF THE TRAYVON AS VICTIM THEME AND PEOPLE.
Jon: WE PROMOTE THE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED THEME. AND PEOPLE. TRAYVON IS VICTIM PEOPLE. IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THE PARTY RECEIVING THE BULLET IS TYPICALLY KNOWN AS THE VICTIM. YOU WANT A PEOPLE THOUGH? THIS WOULD BE MORE OF A PEOPLE ON THAT. WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THIS. NBC'S EDITED TAPE ASSIGNED A MOTIVE TO GEORGE ZIMMERMAN. IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THERE AT ALL. THAT WAS WRONG. WE DON'T KNOW WHY ZIMMERMAN DID WHAT HE DID. THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE PUT THAT TAPE OUT THERE. JUST LIKE WE DON'T KNOW WHY THE NBC WHO GOT FIRED DID WHAT HE OR SHE DID.
THEY DOCTORED A TAPE SO THEY COULD ADVANCE THE NARRATIVE THAT ZIMMERMAN  KILLED TRAYVON MARTIN BECAUSE IT WAS RACIALLY MOTIVATED. THIS WAS DELIBERATELY DONE.
SEAN, THIS ISN'T DISTORTION. THIS ISN'T BIAS. THIS ISN'T DISTORTION. THIS IS AN ALL-OUT FALSEHOOD BY NBC NEWS.
THIS IS A MEDIA LYNCH MOB.
Jon: TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
