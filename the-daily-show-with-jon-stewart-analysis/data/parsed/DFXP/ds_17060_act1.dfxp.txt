FEBRUARY 20, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GREAT SHOW FOR TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, ALAN HUFFMAN AN HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT THE DARK SIDE OF AMERICAN  POLITICS OR AS IT IS SOMETIMES KNOWN, AMERICAN POLITICS. LET'S BEGIN WITH THE BATTLE BETWEEN RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OVER  CONTRACEPTION IN OUR ONGOING COVERAGE OF THE NANNY STATE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING THE STORY, LET ME BRING YOU UP TO SPEED. YEARS AGO ADAM AND EVE LIVED IN A GARDEN. LET'S JUST SCROLL UP. OKAY, OKAY. MARTIN LUTHER NAILED 95 THESIS. LET'S SCROLL UP. OKAY. HERE WE GO. TWO WEEKS AGO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FOUND ITSELF AT THE CENTER OF A CONTROVERSY  OVER ITS DECISIONS TO MAKE RELIGIOUS AFFILIATED INSTITUTIONS OR THEIR INSURERS  COVER CONTRACEPTION AS PART OF THEIR GOVERNMENT-MANDATED HEALTH CARE. THE MOVE WAS SEEN BY SOME RELIGIOUS LEADERS AS BAL'S BIGGEST MISSTEP SINCE THE TIME  HE SET ASIDE A CHAIR FOR ELIJAH WOOD AT THE PASSOVER SEDER. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ORTHODOX JEWS THAT REALLY GOT THAT. EVERYONE ELSE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. SO WE HAVE OURSELVES AN OLD- FASHIONED LIBERTY STAND OFF. ON THE ONE HAND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE FORCED TO PAY MONEY FOR INSURANCE PLANS FOR CONTRACEPTION FOR  EVEN THEIR NON-CATHOLIC EMPLOYEES ALTHOUGH THEY DO PAY THOSE EMPLOYEES MONEY. THE ARGUMENT COULD BE PAID BY PAYING CHURCH MONEY, IS USED FOR ENTRANCE FEES TO CLUBS OR  CATS TO HAVE SEX WITH DOGS. ACE STREET AND THIRD AVENUE. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ON THE OTHER HAND, BIG BUSINESS. ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE WOMEN WHO FOR SOME REASON WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE  COSTS PROVIDED BY THEIR HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROVIDER. TOUGH CASE BECAUSE THE SIDES ARE THE CATHOLICS AND WOMEN. BOTH ARE INFALLIBLE. AM I RIGHT? SO LAST THURSDAY CONGRESSMAN DARRELL ISSA CONVENED A PANEL THAT SETTLED THE ISSUE. WHILE NO LADIES WERE ACTUALLY ALLOWED TO SPEAK UNTIL THE AFTERNOON SESSION AND NO  LADIES ACTUALLY EVER SPOKE ON BEHALF OF LADIES, SOME OF THESE FELLOWS WERE WEARING GOWNS. SO THAT'S SOMETHING. LET'S HEAR THE TONE THAT THE SAUSAGEFEST STRUCK IN THIS EFFORT TO FIND BALANCE BETWEEN  RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE REALITIES OF THE SECULAR WORLD.
I DON'T NORMALLY QUOTE FROM JOSEPH STALIN.
Jon: I'M GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHT THERE. WE'LL JUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT GUY IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT. ANYONE HAVE A SLIGHTLY LESS HYPERBOLIC TAKE ON THIS?
THE VIOLATION OF A PERSON'S RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE WAS NOTHING LESS THAN THE RAPE OF  THE SOUL.
Jon: THAT'S A QUOTE FROM ROGER WILLIAMS AND I BELIEVE  THE WORST LAW AND ORDER SPIN-OFF YET. LISTEN. NO ONE LOVES THEIR= PLAN, BUT SOUL RAPE? YOU MAY NOT REALIZE THIS BUT CATHOLIC CHURCH ALREADY OFFERS HEALTH PLANS THAT COVER VIAGRA. A.K.A., FOUR-HOUR JOHNSON JUICE. I'M GUESSING THAT THAT DOESN'T RAPE THE SOUL. SOME OF YOUR EMPLOYEE IZ GUESS ARE GETTING THAT SUBSIDIZED VIE AGO A AND SOME OF THEM ARE  SINGLE UNMARRIED MEN. WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE DOING WITH THEIR ERECTION? SERIOUSLY WE'D LOVE TO KNOW. SEND YOUR RESPONSES TO BRIAN WILLIAMS CARE OF... (  (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  SO HOW IS IT THAT... I CAN'T  WAIT TO FIND OUT. HOW IS IT THAT WOMEN CAN'T GET THEIR PILL BUT MEN CAN GET THEIR PILL? AS IT HAPPENS THE CHURCH ANSWERED THAT VERY QUESTION 12 YEARS AGO.
VIE AGO A ACTUALLY ANSWERS A MEDICAL PROBLEM. CONTRACEPTION IS A CHOICE THAT SOMEBODY MAY MAKE, BUT IT DOESN'T ANSWER A PARTICULAR  HEALTH CARE NEED.
Jon: TWO THINGS, WHY ONE DOES 12 YEARS AGO LOOK LIKE THE '70s ON TELEVISION? HAVE WE REALLY ADVANCED THAT FAR IN 12 YEARS? TWO, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SAYS A MAN IS IN NEED BUT NOT GETTING PREGNANT IS MORE OF A WANT. BY THE WAY WHILE I WAS SURPRISED THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS PRO MEDICALLY  INDUCED BONERS I WAS MORE SHOCKED AT THE AD IT RAN TO SHOW ITS SUPPORT. NOW, YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THE SPIRIT WILL MOVE YOU.Q,:ï¿½M ANYWAY, I DIGRESS. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY BOTH GET TO WEAR THAT. BACK TO HEARING. WE'VE ALREADY HER FROM THE STALIN AND RAPIST PEOPLE. COULD SOMEONE PUT THIS IN TERMS THAT ARE MORE RELATEABLE.
FOR MY TESTIMONY TODAY, I WOULD LIKE TO TELL A STORY. LET'S CALL IT THE PARABLE OF THE KOSHER DELI.
Jon: GO ON.
ONCE UPON A TIME A NEW LAW WAS PROPOSED SO THAT ANY BUSINESS THAT SERVES FOOD MUST  SERVE PORK. CAN A CUSTOMER COME TO A KOSHER DELI, DEMAND TO BE SERVED A HAM SANDWICH, AND IF  REFUSED BRING DOWN SEVERE GOVERNMENT SANCTION ON THE DELI? A NATION COMMITTED TO RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND DIVERSITY, THE ANSWER IS NO. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: DO YOU GOT MY PEOPLE? SO YOUR PAR ABLE ABOUT THE KOSHER DELI, WHILE DELICIOUS, MAKES NO (BEEP) SENSE. NOBODY IS FORCING THE KOSHER DELI OWNER TO SERVE A HAM. IN THE METAPHOR IT'S MORE LIKE THE OWNER OF THE KOSHER DELI IS REFUSING TO PAY TAXES  BECAUSE HIS MONEY COULD GO TO FOOD STAMPS WHICH SOMEONE MIGHT THEORETICALLY USE TO BUY HAM. TO BE FAIR TO DARRELL ISSA AT THE HEARINGS A WOMAN WAS PUT FORTH TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF  SOMEONE WHO NEEDED CONTRACEPTION. THAT SPEAKER WAS DENIED A SPOT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, STALIN RAPE. ANYWAY, ARE THESE LADYLESS DISCUSSIONS OF THE BATTLE BETWEEN RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND  FEMALE PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE A SEEMING RELIC OF A DYING AGE? TO TRUEY UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES WOMEN FACE IN THEIR REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES  LET'S GO TO OUR NEW ROUND TABLE SEGMENT "JON STEWART'S EYE ON THE LADIES.">  TONIGHT, OUR PANEL LOOKS AT THE QUESTION. IF A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION PROVIDES INSURANCE TO ITS SECULAR EMPLOYEES, SHOULD THAT  PLAN INCLUDE CONTRACEPTION? JON OLIVER, LET'S START WITH YOU.
NO.
JASON JONES.
HELL NO.
AASIF MANDVI.
IT'S NOT MEDICINE. I'M NOT GOING TO PAY FOR IT.
Jon: MOVING ON....
NO, ACTUALLY, IN MY EXPERIENCE....
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GOING SAY SOMETHING HERE.
Jon: JASON JONES.
I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR WOMEN.
Jon: HOW SO?
I JUST THINK IT'S GOOD FOR THEM. IT'S WHAT I THINK.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
WHAT?
Jon: BUT BIRTH CONTROL OFTENTIMES HAS MEDICAL BENEFITS BEYOND CONTRACEPTION. THE PILL CAN BE A TREATMENT FOR OVARIAN SIFTS.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, PLEASE, JON. LET'S NOT SULLY A PERFECTLY PLEASANT CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS GOOD FOR WOMEN WITH  TALK OF LADY PARTS.
ABSOLUTELY.
I BELIEVE THEIR FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM IS GOVERNED BY....
Jon: THE POINT IS, WHY ARE CONDOMS IN THE HEALTH CARE BILL IN THE FIRST PLACE? THEY'RE NOT A MEDICATION. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SWALLOW TWO EVERYDAY WITH MEALS TO STAVE OFF FLU.
I'M NOT FALLINGï¿½]mAï¿½9ï¿½ THAT AGAIN. NO, SIR.
THAT WAS BEST CHRISTMAS PARTY EVER. GOT YOU. CHEERS.
OKAY. EXCUSE ME. YOU GUYS DON'T GET TO DECIDE WHETHER CONTRACEPTION IS PART OF PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE. EXPERTS HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT IT IS.
YIKES. LOOKS LIKE IT'S HIGH TIDE AGAIN.
EXCUSE ME.
I MADE A CAT NOISE IMPLYING YOU'RE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH  EMOTIONAL VOLATILITY KNOWN TO OCCUR DURING TIME OF WOMEN'S MENSES.
OH, FOR (BEEP) SAKE. 1
Jon: WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS TOPIC?
WELL, HONESTLY I THINK THAT WE DON'T GET TO DECIDE WHETHER CONTRACEPTION IS A PART OF  PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE UNTIL EXPERTS HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT IT IS.
Jon: THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
WE WANT TO SEE BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE.
OPEN MINDED. I LIKE THAT IN A MAN.
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.
YEAH, BOOM, BOOM. I KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS SOONER.
Jon: THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE'VE GOT. JOIN US NEXT WEEK. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BREAST. CAN WE TRUST WOMEN TO SELF EXAMINE?
(BEEP).
