(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. LAST WEEK YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE  UNITED STATES SENATE VOTED DOWN  A TREATY THAT WOULD GIVE DISABLED PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD  EQUAL RIGHTS. WE COVERED IT IN A SEGMENT WE  CALLED "PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS  NOT POSSIBLE."  FUNNY STORY. IT TURNS OUT IT BRINGS ME TO OUR  NEWS SEGMENT. THE SENATE IS TO INEPT THAT  SOONER OR LATER ONE OF THESE  GUYS IS JUST GOING TO SIT ON HIS OWN BALLS. THAT IS NOT THAT HARD TO DO. AS YOU KNOW, THE SENATE  CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A  HIGH-STAKES CHESS GAME OVER THE  FISCAL CLIFF. ONE OF THE PIECES THEY'RE MOVING  AROUND THE BOARD IS THE DEBT  CEILING. PRESIDENT OBAMA RECENTLY SAID  THAT HE, THE PRESIDENT, SHOULD  HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING NOT THE CONGRESS. THEY USE IT AS A BARGAINING  CHIP. THAT'S NOT RYE. SENATE MINORITY LEADER MITCH  McCONNELL KNOWS WHAT THAT  MEANS
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES, NOW HE'S ASKING FOR AN  UNLIMITED -- UNLIMITED -- AUTHORITY TO BORROW WHENEVER HE  WANTS TO FOR WHATEVER AMOUNT HE  WANTS TO?
Jon: (MUSMING) ALL RIGHT. SO THE SENATOR CLEARLY DOESN'T  KNOW WHAT THE DEBT CEILING  MEANS. THE DEBT CEILING IS A CONTROL  IMPOSED ON THE TREASURY  DEPARTMENT BY CONGRESS IN ORDER TO, YOU KNOW, IS THERE JUST SOME  WELL INFORMED AND RESPECTED  AUTHORITY THAT CAN EXPLAIN WHAT THE DEBT CEILING IS
IT GIVES THE GOVERNMENT  PERMISSION TO PAY BACK THE MONEY  WE ALREADY BORROWED
Jon: TOTALLY RIGHT. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE  HE WAS TALKING TOO FAST BUT I  THINK HE'S [BLEEP] RIGHT. AND I LIKE THAT LADY TOO. I DON'T KNOW HER. EVEN IF SENATOR McCONNELL  DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE DEBT  CEILING HE DOES UNDERSTAND HOW TO PLAY SENATE CHESS. HE KNOWS WHILE OBAMA WANTS THE  DEBT CEILING DEBATE REMOVED,  SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID, HE DON'T HAVE THE 51 VOTES  HE NEEDS TO GET THAT PASSED SO  McCONNELL IS GOING TO TRAP REED IN A CORNER.
AN UNLIMITED AUTHORITY TO  BORROW WHENEVER HE WANTS TO FOR  WHATEVER AMOUNT HE WANTS TO? IF THE MAJORITY LEADER SUPPORTS  THAT PROPOSAL I WOULD HOPE WE  CAN GET A VOTE ON IT TO GIVE HIS MEMBERS A CHANCE TO EXPRESS  THEMSELVES AS TO WHETHER OR NOT  THEY THINK THAT'S A GOOD WAY FORWARD FOR OUR COUNTRY.
Jon: [BLEEP]. IT IS A CLASSIC OPENING. HE'S PROPOSING A BILL THAT HE  DOESN'T SUPPORT, McCONNELL,  KNOWING THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL LOOK BAD WHEN HARRY REID REFUSES  TO CALL A VOTE ON IT
SENATOR McCONNELL MADE A  SERIOUS OFFER DEALING WITH THE  DEBT CEILING IN THIS COUNTRY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES  FACING THE COUNTRY. IT'S A SERIOUS OFFER. I PERSONALLY HAVEN'T READ IT. MY STAFF HAS LOOKED AT IT. IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT I  WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A VOTE ON IT  THIS AFTERNOON.
Jon: HAVEN'T SEEN THAT  BEFORE. HARRY REID JUST ATE  McCONNELL'S CHESS PIECES. TURNS OUT REED HAD THE 51 VOTES  TO PASS McCONNELL'S SARCASTIC  BILL AND SAID, FINE, LET'S DO THIS, MO-HO. REALLY IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE  PART WHERE HARRY REID SAID VERY  SERIOUS OFFER THAT I HAVEN'T PERSONALLY READ, THE WHOLE THING  ALMOST SOUNDED PROFESSIONAL. NOW, McCONNELL BETTER HAVE A  PRETTY STRONG COUNTERATTACK  HERE. IF HE WANTS TO STAY IN THE GAME.
MATTERS OF THIS LEVEL OF  CONTROVERSY ALWAYS REQUIRE 60  VOTES. I WOULD ASK MY FRIEND THE  MAJORITY LEADER IF HE WOULD  MODIFY HIS CONSENT AGREEMENT TO SET THE THRESHOLD FOR THIS VOTE  AT 60
Jon: THAT'S THE BULL [BLEEP] RIGHT THERE. PASSING A LAW IN THE SENATE  REQUIRES 51 VOTES. THERE IS NO EXTRA CONTROVERSY  RULE THAT TURNS IT INTO 60. PARLIAMENTARIAN WILL BE LIKE  FORCE TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUNDS. WE'RE GOING TO NEED 75 ON THAT  ONE. THAT'S CRAZY. THAT'S CONTROVERSY. I MEAN, ANYTHING THAT THE LADIES  FROM THE VIEW CAN MAKE A MEAL  OF, WE'VE GOT TO HAVE 80. I'M SORRY. OH, THREE NACHO TUESDAY? LET'S JUST HAVE THREE PEOPLE. MITCH McCONNELL SHOULD KNOW  THAT JUST ABOUT THE ONLY TIME  YOU NEED 60 VOTES IS TO BREAK A  FILIBUSTER. THE DEMOCRATS AREN'T GOING TO  PHILADELPHIA BRISTER HIS BILL. ... AREN'T GOING TO FILIBUSTER  HIS BILL. WAIT A MINUTE. THAT ISN'T MEAN...
NOW THE REPUBLICAN LEADER  OBJECTS TO HIS OWN IDEA. I GUESS WE HAVE A FILIBUSTER OF  HIS OWN BILL.
Jon: WOW! MITCH McCONNELL PROPOSED A  BILL AND NOW HE'S FILIBUSTERING  HIS OWN BILL. LET ME PUT THIS IN CHESS TERMS. McCONNELL WALKED UP TO THE  TABLE AND SAT ON HIS OWN BALLS. IN FACT, THE PRESIDING OFFICER  OFFICER... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ... CLAIRE McCASKILL HAS TO  CHECK TO MAKE SURE SHE HEARD RIGHT
IS THERE OBJECTION TO THE  ORIGINAL REQUEST?
YEAH, I OBJECT. OBJECTION IS HEARD. Jon: YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID  THERE, MITCH McCONNELL? MITCH McCONNELL SAT ON HIS  BALLS SO HARD, HE BROKE CLAIRE  McCASKILL'S NECK. WE'LL BE RIGHT
