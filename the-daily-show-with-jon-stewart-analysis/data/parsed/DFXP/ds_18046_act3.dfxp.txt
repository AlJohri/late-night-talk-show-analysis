HE'S NOT GOING TO SHOOT  HIMSELF AT THE END OF THIS, IS  HE?
I HAVEN'T MADE IT TO THE END  YET.
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.
YOU ARE SO LUCKY THIS IS WHAT  HAPPENS WHEN YOU BREAK UP WITH A  SOCIOPATH. I KNOW I LIKE MURDER IN A SEXY  WAY BUT WHAT IF IT'S MURDEREE IN  LIKE A MURDER WAY?
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME LENA  DUNHAM. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: PLEASE. THE SHOW IS TERRIFIC. YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH IN  SUCH A SHORT TIME. HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH EVERYBODY'S  ANGER ABOUT THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HANDLE IT BEAUTIFULLY.
THANK YOU.
Jon: YOU ARE VERY WELCOME.
I DON'T KNOW -- YOU DEAF  FITLY DO GET THE SENSE THAT  THERE'S SOME 58 YEAR OLDS WHO WISH YOU DEAD.
Jon: YES. IT'S THE INTERNET SEEMS TO BE  THE REPOZ -- REPOSITORY OF WHEN  A YOUNG PERSON GETS SUCCESS BEFORE THE INTERNET DECIDES THEY  ARE OLD ENOUGH.
IT'S ALSO THE PLACE YOUNG  PEOPLE TROLL AROUND FOR  INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES. YOU GET YOURSELF IN TROUBLE. THE LINE IS I DON'T READ  ANYTHING BUT IF I'M BEING HONEST  I READ A QUARTER OF THINGS. I READ WHAT I CAN FIND. THE TOP THREE ITEMS IN GOOGLE  NUSMS YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON  I'M TELLING THIS TO.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
YES. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I DON'T READ  ANYTHING. YOU ACTUALLY READ HALF OF IT AND  THEN SIT THERE TRYING TO FORCE  OUT OF THE ARTISTIC PROCESS.
Jon: I KNOW FOR MYSELF I  ONLY READ THINGS THAT START WITH  YOU KNOW HIS REAL LAST NAME IS LIEBOWITZ BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S A  REASONABLE THE CRITIQUE OF WHAT  I'VE DONE. I'M 50 AND I'VE BEEN REDUCED TO  THE FETAL POSITION UNDER MY DESK  MAKING THE MISTAKE OF CLICKING ON A BLOG AND SAYING I'M WHAT?
YOU LOOK YOUNGER THAT -- THAN  THAT.
Jon: REALLY? YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO  BELIEVES THAT.
I REALLY DO.
Jon: I'M WEARING MAKEUP  AND -- [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S REALLY ROUGH AND I'M  CONSTANTLY. I'M UNKED BIEN WITH MY TWITTER. I'M NOT HIGHLY MEDIA TRAINED. AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES WE WENT TO  THE ENDLESS PRESS OPPORTUNITY  THAT COMES WITH YOU WON THIS GREAT THING AND WORK IT LIKE YOU  ARE JUSTIN BIEBER FOR FOUR  HOURS.
Jon: YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO --
I POSE FOR A LOT OF PICTURES. I'M NOT TRYING TO SOUND  UNGRATEFUL. I WOULD PAYS FOR A MILLION MORE  PICTURES.
Jon: I POSED JUST FROM  WATCHING IT. I SAT IN MY HOUSE.
WE WERE THERE AND THEY WERE  YELLING TURN TO THE LEFT ALL OF  YOU TOUCH THE GLOBE AND ONE PHOTOGRAPHER SAID UGH, NEWBIES.
Jon: I LIKE THE VETERAN  THAT WILL TOUCH THE (bleep)  GLOBE.
AND SOMEONE SCREAMED GET  MEDIA TRAINED. SO YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A  NATURAL PASSIONATE REACTION FOR  RECEIVING YOUR GOLDEN GLOBE BUT YOU ARE GET MEDIA TRAINED TO  TOUGH IT PROPERLY.
Jon: THAT'S AN EXCITING  WAY -- HOPEFULLY YOU'LL GET AN  OPPORTUNITY TO GET IT RIGHT. BY THE FIFTH ONE THEY'LL BE LIKE  THAT'S IT.
YOU ARE OBSESSED WITH GETTING  AN EGOT EMMY, GRAMMY, OSCAR AND  TONY, RIGHT?
Jon: GLOBE COULD BE THE  GRAMMY. YOU HAVE A GLOBE.
WE COULD CHANGE THE  DEFINITION HERE.
Jon: WE'LL DO IT AS WHEEL  OF FORTUNE.
TAKE THE GRAMMYS RIGHT OUT OF  THERE.
Jon: THAT WOULD BE FUN. YOU ARE WRITING FOR ALL THE  CHARACTERS I'M ASSUMING ALLISON  WILLIAMS IS IN IT. HER FATHER IS BRIAN. YOU DO WRITE SEX SCENES. IS THERE ANYTHING COULD YOU DO  MAKE HIM MORE UNCOMFORTABLE. I SAY THIS TO YOUS A PERSONAL  FAVOR TO ME.
WELL, LIKE THE INTERNET I TRY  KEEP BRIAN WILLIAMS OUT OF MY  ARTISTIC PROCESS.
Jon: I THINK THAT'S WISE.
BUT AS A FAN OF HIS I WANT TO  HAVE A BRIAN WILLIAMS CAM OF HIM  WATCHING THE SEX SCENES. AND WE SEE IT PLAY IN REALTIME. THAT'S A DREAM OF MINE BUT I  ALSO --
Jon: HOLD ON. I SAY THIS NOT AS A SAGE, NOT AS  A WISE PERSON FOLLOW YOUR  DREAMS. I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE IN ON  THAT.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THIS SEASON IN THE  CAN?
ALREADY IN THE CAN. WE PREMIERED THE FIRST EPISODE  SUNDAY AND WE'LL COME AT YOU  EVERY WEEK FOR NINE WEEKS. AND PHYSICAL HBO KNOCK ON  WHATEVER BEAUTIFUL MATERIAL YOUR  DESK IS MADE OF.
Jon: LUCITE.
I HOPE THEY GIVE US A NEW  SEASON BECAUSE I WANT SEXUAL  POSITIONS WE HAVEN'T YET  COVERED.
Jon: I'M 50 DON'T TELL ME  WHAT THEY ARE. THANK YOU. CONGRATULATIONS ON EVERYTHING.
THANK YOU.
Jon: GIRLS IS ON SUNDAY
