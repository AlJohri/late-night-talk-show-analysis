(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
John: WELCOME BACK. NOW, ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF  THIS JOB IS TO ENGAGE THE  AUDIENCE IN SOMETHING THEY HAVE NO INHERENT INTEREST IN. THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH AGAIN  TONIGHT BECAUSE SADLY WE'RE  ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT MARIJUANA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  GROW UP! NOW NOT NERVE THE MEDICAL  COMMUNITY IS A BIG FAN OF IT,  BUT LAST THURSDAY THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED THANKS TO AMERICA'S  FAVORITE DOCTOR-- NOT HIM--  (LAUGHTER)  I'M TALKING ABOUT THE REAL  McDREAMY.
DR. SANJAY GUPTA CHANGES HIS  MIND ON WEED.
SANJAY, YOU WERE VERY  CRITICAL OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA  FOR A LONG TIME. YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND. TELL US WHY.
John: WHOO! SANJAY GUPTA GETTING ON THE MARY  JANE TRAIN! CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT OF  THE CANNABIS NEWS NETWORK! (LAUGHTER)  SMOKING SOME WEED WITH AARON  BURNOUT AND WOLF BLITZ-HER. ISANJ, WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND  ABOUT THE GANJ?
WE'VE BEEN TERRIBLY AND  SYSTEMATICALLY MISFLED THIS  COUNTRY FOR SOME TIME. I TOOK THE D.E.A. AT THEIR WORD  WHEN THEY SAID IT'S A SCHEDULE 1  SUBSTANCE AND HAS NO MEDICAL  APPLICATION.
John: WAIT, YOU TOOK THE DRUG  ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AT THEIR  BOARD? IS THERE ANY OTHER MEDICAL  MISINFORMATION THAT YOU MAY  STILL BELIEVE JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD YOU? YOU KNOW YOU DON'T ACTUALLY GO  BLIND FROM JACKING IT, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE I JUST FOUND THAT OUT  TWO WEEKS AGO AND IT'S TURNED MY  LIFE AROUND. ANYWAY, DR. G., PLEASE CONTINUE  YOUR REPORT ON WEED! WHAT'S NEXT? A REPORT ON TASTY MONEY CHIS?
VERY EARLY STUDIES ON MICE  HAVE SHOWING THE POTENTIAL OF  MARE WAN UNANIMOUS TO KILL CANCER CELLS. HE'S USING MARIJUANA TO HELP HIM  WITH THE PAIN AND NAUSEA FROM  CHEMOTHERAPY. RESIDENTS LEER USING MARIJUANA  FOR PAIN, LOSS OF APPETITE,  PARKINSON'S AND DEMENTIA. (LAUGHTER)
John: OH, RIGHT, BECAUSE  MARIJUANA HAS REAL MEDICAL  BENEFITS AND CAN BE PRESCRIBED BY DOCTORS. IN FACT, DISPENSARIES SELL  DIFFERENT STRENGTHS TO TREAT  DIFFERENT PROBLEMS AND, ON THAT NOTE, IF YOU WANT THIS DRUG AND  ITS MEDICAL BENEFITS TO BE TAKEN  SERIOUSLY HOW ABOUT ADULTING UP THE MAZE A LITTLE BIT. THAT WAY A SICK OLD MAN DOESN'T  HAVE TO A QUARTER OUNCE OF  RAINBOW DIESEL FUNKADELIC CHEDDAR HARMONY. (LAUGHTER)  JUST A SUGGESTION. BUT I HAVE TO GIVE CNN CREDIT  WHERE IT'S DUE. SANJAY GUPTA COPED TO HIS ERROR,  THE WEED SPECIAL TALKED ABOUT  THE LEGITIMATE USES OF MARIJUANA AND THEY ANSWERED THE QUESTION  THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN ASKING:  WHAT'S PIERS MORGAN LIKE WHEN HE'S HIGH?
I'M GOING TO MAKE A SHOCKING  REVELATION HERE. I TRIED CANNABIS WHEN I WAS A  YOUNGER LAD AND I'VE ALSO HAD TO  HAVE VICODIN WHEN I BROKE SOME RIBS FALLING OFF A SEGUE IN  SANTA MONICA. I CAN TELL YOU, IT WAS THE  VICODIN WHICH I WAS PRESCRIBED  BY MY DOCTOR WHICH GAVE ME A MASSIVELY HIGHER HIGH THAN THE  CANNABIS EVER DID.
John: OKAY, THIS IS  IMPORTANT. I WOULD LIKE TO PERSONALLY OFFER  $10,000 IN REWARD TO ANYONE WHO  CAN BRING ME FOOTAGE OF PIERS MORGAN FALLING OFF THAT SEGWAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I MEAN IT, NEITHER VICODIN NOR  MARIJUANA NOR THE PURIST ECSTASY CAN BRING
