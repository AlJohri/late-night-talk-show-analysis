Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, A MUSICIAN. HIS LATEST C.D. IS "BORN FREE" JUST WENT PLATINUM. HE'S ALSO CURRENTLY ON HIS BORN-FREE TOUR. PLEASE WELCOME KID ROCK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ♪ I WAS BORN FREE I WAS BORN FREE ♪♪
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO BE ON THE SHOW.
Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU'RE PLAYING IN JERSEY TONIGHT.
UH-HUH.
Jon: REALLY? THAT'S FOR NEW JERSEY? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE LIVE IN THE TRI-STATE AREA. YOU HEAR ABOUT NEW JERSEY EVERY DAY. [LAUGHTER] THE CONCERT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED. HOW DID IT GO?
TOUGH QUESTION.
Jon: YOU PLAY... IS THIS A GOOD PLACE YOU LIKE PLAYING?
JERSEY, THEY'RE NUTS.
Jon: THE BEST, RIGHT.
BOSTON, JERSEY, JUST COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR MINDS. DRINKING ALL DAY, PARKING LOTS, JUST WANT TO BREAK STUFF AND GO NUTS.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT'S SAD ABOUT THAT? WE DO THAT EVEN WHEN THERE ARE NO CONCERTS. [LAUGHTER] IT'S OUR LIVES. I'M GOING TO OUT YOU TONIGHT. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS.
OUT ME?
Jon: I'M GOING TO OUT YOU. KID ROCK, HE HAS HIS OWN BEER, BAD ASS BEER.
BAD ASS. HELPING THE ECONOMY.
Jon: HELPING THE ECONOMY. YOU GOT YOUR PARTY MUSIC. BUT THIS IS WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT KID ROCK WHEN HE DID THE RALLY WITH US IN WASHINGTON. YOU, SIR, ARE A PROFESSIONAL. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
DON'T BLOW MY STREET CRED.
DEALING WITH YOU WAS A PLEASURE.
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER. CAN WE JUST EXPLAIN FOR PEOPLE. YOU THINK YOU HAVE YOUR PUBLICISTS CALL EACH OTHER. WE'RE TRYING TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. HE CALLS ME UP ASKS ME TO DO IT. I CALLED HIM UP, BANG, DONE.
Jon: AND IT WAS DONE, BUT HE WOULD CALL ME AND BE LIKE, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO PUT THIS ON A DX FORMAT WITH A 550. I'M GOING TO GET CI TO LAY DOWN SOME TRACK ON GREEN SCREEN. AND I'M LIKE, YOU'RE NOT KID ROCK, YOU'RE NERD ROCK. YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF IT, I HAD NO IDEA. HOW DID YOU DEVELOP THAT KIND OF EXPERTISE IN PRODUCING AS WELL AS THE MUSIC?
I USED TO SWEEP FLOORS IN A RECORDING STUDIO WHEN I STARTED.
Jon: REALLY?
I STARTED SWEEPING FLOORS. THEY LET ME INTO THE BACK ROOM AT MIDNIGHT, A LITTLE GREMLIN. I MADE MY OWN MUSIC ON THE SIDE. THAT'S WHERE I GOT GOING AND LEARNED ABOUT ALL THAT STUFF.
Jon: AND YOU PLAY EVERY INSTRUMENT.
I PLAY THEM. ASK A MUSICIAN, THEY'RE LIKE, YEAH, I CAN ENTERTAIN YOU WITH THEM.
Jon: SO YOU DON'T EVEN... TO YOU IT'S JUST SECOND NATURE NOW. YOU DON'T REALIZE. LIKE IF YOU HAD YOUR DRUTHERS, WOULD IT BE... WOULD YOU BE HOLED UP WITH ALL THAT... WITH JUST ALL YOUR INSTRUMENTS AND  THE TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT? IS THAT FUN FOR YOU OR IS IT THE STAGE?
IT WOULD BE JUST A GUITAR, A GUITAR AND A CAMPFIRE. THAT'S FUN. BEER HELPS. A COUPLE BUDDIES AROUND. I LOVE THAT.
Jon: YOU'RE A HIPPIE? [LAUGHTER] A GUITAR AND A CAMPFIRE.
IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN I'M MAKING IT SOUND.
Jon: I MANNING IT'S VERY NICE, YOU AND A BOY SCOUT TROOP. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON NOW. SO YOU DON'T... EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME, THE REAL PLEASURE IS  SIMPLE SITTING AND PLAYING SONGS AND HANGING OUT.
I REALLY LIKE EVERY ASPECT OF IT. I LIKE RECORDING. I LIKE PLAYING LIVE. I LIVE AND BREATH MUSIC. THAT'S WHAT I DO.
AND SHERYL CROW IS ON TOUR WITH YOU RIGHT NOW, RIGHT? SHE'S HANGING OUT.
I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THAT. HAVING TO BE THE RESPONSIBLE ONE ON TOUR EVERY NIGHT, IT'S LIKE... [LAUGHTER] I'M TALKING SHOW'S OVER, HERE COMES CHERYL WITH THE WHISKY, TVS OUT OF THE HOTEL ROOM, JON. MUSIC IS ON TEN. I'M LIKE, KEEP IT DOWN, THE KIDS ARE SLEEPING.
Jon: HOW DO YOU KEEP HER IN CHECK?
I'VE PRETTY MUCH GIVEN UP ALL HOPE.
Jon: YOUR KID IS LIKE...
18.
Jon: AND HE'S GOING OFF TO COLLEGE NOW.
I KNOW. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET A D.N.A. TEST OR SOMETHING. HE'S A GREAT KID.
Jon: YOU'RE A VERY RESPONSIBLE YOUNG MAN. YOU HAVE A NICE FAMILY. IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE YOU AND GET TO KNOW YOU AT THAT RALLY. I REALLY ENJOYED IT. IT WAS TERRIFIC. WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO NOW, DOING MORE STUFF FOR DETROIT?
TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. IT'S A TOUGH TOWN, BUT TOUGH TOWNS MAKE TOUGH PEOPLE. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THAT CITY, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE THAT ARE IN AND FROM AROUND. THERE WHEN YOU GET THAT MUCH HUMAN NATURE, THE FORCE OF HUMAN NATURE AND THE PEOPLE THAT CARE  ABOUT SOMETHING THINK IT'S GOT A REAL SHOT.
Jon: YOU'RE OUT THERE. YOUR FOUNDATION IS DOING WORK OUT THERE AND YOU'RE BRINGING IT BACK?
GOT A FOUNDATION WITH NO OVERHEAD. I DON'T HAVE SILLY GOLF TOURNAMENTS TO RAISE MONEY OR NONE OF THAT STUFF.
Jon: IT'S JUST GIVING MONEY OUT TO PEOPLE.
BASICALLY.
Jon: WE HAVE UNMASKED AND OUTED KID ROCK TONIGHT AS A RESPONSIBLE, CARING, DILIGENT, PROFESSIONAL PARENT. [AUDIENCE REACTS] AND, AND IN THE PROCESS, WE'VE TOTALLY [BLEEPED] YOUR CAREER.
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. CAREER IS OVER.
Jon: NOT AT ALL. GREAT TO SEE YOU, MAN.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.
COME BACK AND SEE US AGAIN SOME TIME WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER ANYTHING EXCITED WE  NEED TO KNOW ABOUT.
NO, PRETTY MUCH JUST WANTED TO COME ON THE SHOW FOR THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY HATE ME. SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT ME. I'M STILL HERE. CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?
Jon: HE'S A VERY PLEASANT MAN. FUN AT PARTIES. THAT IS CORRECT, AS WELL. "BORN FREE" IS IN THE STORES RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN CATCH KID ROCK ON TOUR. YOU CAN BUY BAD ASS BEER. YOU CAN ONLY BUY IT IN SINGLES, THOUGH, UNFORTUNATELY.
ONLY IN MICHIGAN.
Jon: ONLY IN MICHIGAN AND ONLY IN SINGLES. GOOD TO SEE YOU. KID ROCK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
