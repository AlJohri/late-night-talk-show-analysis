[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. THIS PAST WEEK, JUST THIS PAST WEEK, JUST THIS PAST WEEK GLOBAL LEADERS GATHERED IN NEW YORK FOR THE UNITED NATIONS ANNUAL MOTORCADE COMPETITION. [LAUGHING] BUT APPARENTLY IN BETWEEN CAUSING TRAFFIC JAMS THEY SOMETIMES MADE SPEECHES.
FOR ALL THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES THAT WE GATHER TO ADDRESS THIS WEEK. TERRORISM, INSTABILITY, INEQUALITY, DISEASE, THERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT WILL DEFINE THE CONTOURS OF THIS CENTURY MORE DRAMATICALLY THAN ANY OTHER.
Jon: I'M GOING TO GO WITH -- THE TERRIFYING ENTHUSIASM OF ONE DIRECTION FANS? [LAUGHING] I HAD TO LOG OFF MY OWN INSTAGRAM. THEY'RE VICIOUS.
THE URGENT AND GROWING THREAT OF A CHANGING CLIMATE.
Jon: OH, WELL THAT'S ALSO SCARY. OKAY. MAYBE IF WE GET THE ONE DIRECTIONERS UPSET ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. I HEARD -- I HEARD HARRY IS FLOATING OUT TO SEA ON AN ICE CAP. [ APPLAUSE ] NOW THAT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA AT LAST WEEK'S U.N. CLIMATE SUMMIT. ALTHOUGH IN SOME WAYS, THE MOST IMPORTANT SPEAKERS WERE THE LEADERS OF SEVERAL LOW LYING ISLAND NATIONS A WHO'S WHO OF WHO'S ALMOST UNDERWATER. FROM THE BAHAMAS TO PALAU TO KIRIBATI, ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA AND OF COURSE SAMOA, WHICH IS NOT JUST THE HOME OF EVERYONE'S THIRD FAVORITE GIRL SCOUT COOKIE.
THIS IS IS A OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THE U.N. IS FIT FOR PURPOSE WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPORT FOR SIDS.
Jon: SIDS? SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES. TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO CAN'T CATCH A BREAK. THEY EVEN HAVE TO SHARE THEIR ACRONYM WITH SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME. THAT'S ALMOST AS BAD AS WHEN I CREATED MY MAIL DELIVERY CHARITY HELPING ELDERLY RETIREES PLAN EVENING SUPPER. [ APPLAUSE ] AND AFTER, YEAH IT'S NOT -- WOW, I DIDN'T REALIZE I DID THAT WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG. THAT WAS INTERESTING. YOU KNOW, YOU GET PICTURES OF ME NOW, I WORK HERE. YOU KNOW AFTER HEARING THOSE MOVING SPEECHES WHO WOULDN'T STAND UP TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE.
THE LEADERS OF CHINA AND INDIA CHOSE NOT TO ATTEND THE SUMMIT TODAY.
Jon: OH REALLY. THE LEADERS OF INDIA AND CHINA CHOSE NOT TO ATTEND. AND COINCIDENTALLY THEY'VE ALSO CHOSEN TO BE THE FIRST AND THIRD BIGGEST PRODUCERS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS. SURE THE U.S. IS NUMBER TWO, BUT STILL! AT LEAST PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS THERE TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES. LIKE FOR INSTANCE, EVERYONE SAYING THEY NEED TO HAVE A CARBON TAX.
HAN ALSO CALLED FOR PUTTING A PRICE ON CARBON. SOMETHING THE UNITED STATES HAS REJECTED.
Jon: REJECTED IS SUCH A HARSH WORD. HOW ABOUT POLITELY DECLINE TO LEGISLATIVELY CONSIDER, BECAUSE IT MIGHT EFFECT US. SO DID ANYTHING GET DONE AT THIS SUMMIT?
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN REACHING SUCH AN AGREEMENT WERE ON DISPLAY EVEN TODAY. BRAZIL, FOR EXAMPLE, SAID IT WOULD NOT SIGN A PLAN TO HALT DEFORESTATION BY 2030.
Jon: YOU CAN'T ASK BRAZIL TO HALT DEFORESTATION. THAT'S THEIR WHOLE THING. THE BEST YOU CAN HOPE FOR IS THAT THEY LEAVE JUST A TINY STRIP OF RAINFOREST. [ APPLAUSE ] BUT THE GATHERING -- IT REALLY DOES -- SOUTH AMERICA IS GOING TO LOOK MUCH BETTER IN A BATHING SUIT NOW. BUT THE GATHERING WASN'T TOTALLY HOPELESS. ONE UN AGENCY STILL BELIEVES THAT THE PLANET CAN BE SAVED. GRANTED IT'S THE AV DEPARTMENT.
ONE DAY WE WILL WAKE UP TO FIND THAT THE ENERGY THAT POWERS THE ALARM CLOCK CAME THROUGH THE BREEZE THROUGH THE TREES. IT WON'T SCAR THE LAND OR POISON THE SEAS. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET TO THAT DAY FROM WHERE WE ARE TODAY? ALL 7.3 BILLION OF US.
Jon: WOW, NICELY DONE. BUT IF YOU WANT TO CAPTURE THE FULL GRAVITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN A DIFFERENT MORGAN FREEMAN MONOLOGUE.
THIS IS IT. IF THE WORLD DOES GO ON, IT WILL NOT GO ON FOR EVERYONE. NEW YORK CITY, BOSTON, ATLANTA, PHILADELPHIA, ALL WILL BE DESTROYED. SO, THAT'S IT. GOOD LUCK TO US ALL.
Jon: WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. I HOPE.
