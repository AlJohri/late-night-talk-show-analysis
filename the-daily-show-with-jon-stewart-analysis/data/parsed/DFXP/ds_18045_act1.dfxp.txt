FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. NICE PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. FRESH OFF A GELDEN GLOBES  VICTORY, JESSICA CHASTAIN IS  GOING TO BE HERE FROM THE FILM "ZERO DARK THIRTY". I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT FOR  ANYBODY BUT KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE  BIN LADEN CHARACTER. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, LISTEN, AS YOU KNOW  FOLLOWING A SERIES OF TERRIBLE  GUN TRAGEDIES IN THIS COUNTRY IN LET'S CALL IT 30 YEARS OF YOU  ARE BAR WARFARE, AMERICA IS IN  THE MIDST OF A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS. THE NRA HAS BEEN CLEAR THOUGHT  WOULD MEET ANY GUN LAWS WITH  SERIOUS RESISTANCE.
THEY ARE GETTING THE MESSAGE  OUT RNCHT PRESIDENT'S KIDS MORE  IMPORTANT THAN YOURS? WHY IS HE SKEPTICAL BUT PUTTING  ARMED SECURITY IN SCHOOLS WHEN  HIS KIDS ARE PROTECTED AT THEIR  SCHOOLS?
Jon: AND WHY DOES HE GET TO  VETO BILLS AND COMMAND AN ARMY  WHEN WE DON'T? ALL RIGHT SO THE CONVERSATION  HAS STARTED AND WE'RE OFF TO A  DEPLORABLE START. [ LAUGHTER ] I SWEAR TO YOU IF I DIDN'T KNOW  ANY BETTER AND I'M NOT A BIG  CONSPIRACY GUY, I WOULD THINK THE NRA IS AN ELABORATE AFTER  VANT GEARD JOAQUIN PHOENIX STYLE  JOKE OR A FALSE FLAG OPERATION RUN BY MICHAEL MOORE IN AN  ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT RESPONSIBLE  GUN OWNERS. YOUR RESPONSE, MR. PRESIDENT.
I BELIEVE THE SECOND  AMENDMENT GUARANTEES AN  INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS. I BELIEVE MOST GUN OWNERS AGREE  WE CAN RESPECT THE SECOND  AMENDMENT WHILE KEEPING AN IRRESPONSIBLE LAW BREAKING FEW  FROM INFLICTING HARM ON A  MASSIVE SCALE.
Jon: INTERESTING OPEN ON  HIS PART. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO SAY IF  YOU BRING UP MY KIDS AGAIN I'LL  DRUM STRIKE YOU'RE (bleep) TO KINGDOM COME. I UNDERSTAND THAT. HE UNVEILED LEGISLATIVE  PROPOSALS AND 23 ACTIONS TO  BEGIN TO ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE INCLUDING LIMITING MAGAZINE  SIZE, RESTRICTING ASSAULT  WEAPONS, EXPAND BACKGROUND CHECKS AND ODDLY ENOUGH PROVIDE  MONEY FOR INCREASED SCHOOL  SECURITY WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY THAT REALLY CHARMING AD. HOW DID HIS RECOMMENDATION GOES  DOWN WITH THE PRO-GUN CROWD?
ALL THE THINGS HE POINTED OUT  WILL ONLY AFFECT LAW ABIDING  CITIZENS WHO ALREADY ABIDE ABOUT IT LAW. WE HAVE OVER 20,000 GUN LAWS ON  THE BOOKS. WE NEED TO ENFORCE THOSE GUN  LAWS.
Jon: YOU KNOW THAT IS --  OKAY. THAT'S TRUE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT HAPPEN IT'S BE ENTIRELY  ACCURATE. WE NEED TO ENFORCE THOSE 20,000  LAWS. UNLESS THEY TAKE THAT  ENFORCEMENT JOB ON THEMSELVES  SLOW DOWN, THERE'S NO NEED. FORMER KANSAS CONGRESSMAN TODD  TIAHRT POINTED OUT WHY MAYORS  SHOULD NOT BE TRYING TO TRACE WHERE ILLEGAL GUNS ARE COMING  FROM.
WHEN CRIMES ARE COMMITTED OR  A DEALER SELLING GUNS ILLEGALLY  WE HAVE AN ORGANIZATION THAT GOES AFTER THEM 4/7 EVERY DAY. IT'S CALLED THE ATF AND THEY  HAVE OFFICERS COMPLETELY  ASSIGNED TO DO THIS.
Jon: THE ATF, THE BUREAU,  ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS. IT'S AN ACTUAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY  NOT JUST A TRADITIONAL SOUTHERN  WEDDING GIFT. LOOK -- [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- I WOULD LIKE -- I WOULD  LIKE -- DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE  REGISTERED REALLY. ALTHOUGH WHEN YOU GET THOSE THEY  DON'T HAVE TO BE REGISTERED. THAT'S THE BEAUTY. I WOULD LIKE THE ATF'S DIRECTOR  TO EXPLAIN TO YOU IF YOU ARE OUT  THERE 24 SLRK 7 WHY IS THIS COUNTRY ASS DEEP IN ILLEGAL GUN?
WE'VE NOT HAD A DIRECTOR OF  ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIRE FOR SIX  YEARS.
Jon: SURE. I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THE  CAPTAIN CAN'T HAVE SUGARY  DRINKS. I DON'T TRUST INFORMATION FROM  ANYONE WHO CAN'T HANDLE MORE  THAN 16 OUNCES OF HIGH FRUCTOSE  AMBROSIA.
THEY HAVEN'T A PERMANENT  DIRECTOR IN SIX YEARS.
Jon: OH, MY GOD THERE'S NO  ATF DIRECTOR. THERE'S NO DIRECTOR OF ATF IS IT  LIKE A MONTESSORI AGENCY WHERE  THERE'S NO DIRECTOR BUT AGENTS WHO JUST ENCOURAGE TO BE  CURIOUS? AND REGULATE WEAPONS AT THEIR  OWN PACE?
THE CURRENT ACTING DIRECTOR  COMMUTES FROM MINNESOTA. HE IS THE U.S. ATTORNEY FROM  MINNESOTA AS WELL AS ACTING  DIRECTOR OF THE ATF?
Jon: WHAT? YOU ARE TELLING ME THIS DUDE,  THE GUY WHO IS THE ACTING  DIRECTOR OF ATF HAS ANOTHER FULL-TIME JOB THAT REGULATING  ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO AND FIREARMS  IS HIS SIDE GIG? [ LAUGHTER ] JUST MOONLIGHTING, PICKING UP A  LITTLE EXTRA DOUGH. WHY? THERE'S 7.8% UNEMPLOYMENT IN  THIS COUNTRY. WE CAN FIND SOMEBODY TO TAKE  THAT JOB WHOP DOESN'T HAVE  ANOTHER JOB.
THE SENATE WON'T CONFIRM  ANYBODY TO THE FULL-TIME JOB.
Jon: IT'S NOT A CABINET  LEVEL POSITION. WHO GIVES A (bleep). OR A SCOWRT JUSTICE. WHY IS IT THE SENATE'S BUSINESS  TO -- I'M TOLD THE SENATE HAS TO  CONFIRM THE ATF DIRECTOR BECAUSE CONGRESSMAN JAMES SENSOR BRENNER  INSERTED THAT PROVISION INTO THE  PATRIOT ACT IN 2006. SORRY I DON'T HAVE FOOTAGE ON  THAT. IT'S DONE ON THE -- I DO HAVE  FOOTAGE OF HIM ACCEPTING THE  NRA'S COVETED DIRECTOR OF FREEDOM AWARD. COINCIDENCE? UNRELATED ACTION. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU KNOW? THEY DON'T HAVE A DIRECTOR. THEY HAVE ATF AGENTS. IN 1972, I WENT ON IN THE 70s  THERE WAS 2500 AGENTS AND THERE  WAS STILL 2500 AGENTS. 39 YEARS LATER --
Jon: NOT THE SAME ONES,  RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] POLICING OVER 100,000 GUN  DEALERS IN THIS COUNTRY WITH A  COUPLE THOUSAND AGENTS WHO ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR TOBACCO AND  ALCOHOL MAY SEEM IMPOSSIBLE BUT  HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS. 18 YEARS AGO A PROFESSOR  ANALYZED ATF TRACING DATA AND  FOUND 57% OF GUNS USED IN CRIMES, THE ILLEGAL GUNS COULD  BE TRACED BACK TO 1% OF THE  LICENSED GUN DEALERS. ALL THE ATF HAS TO DO IS CREATE  A REGISTRY OF THESE  TRANSACTIONS. TRACE THEM BACK TO THE BAD  DEALERS AND THOSE DEALERS  RUINING IT FOR THE LAW ABIDING GUN DEALER AND CITIZENS,  FLOODING CITIES WITH ILLEGAL  GUNS -- MAKE IT STOP.
ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK  TIMES" THE BUREAU IS PROHIBITING  FROM CREATING A FEDERAL REGISTRY OF OF GUN TRANSACTIONS.
Jon: WHAT THE (bleep) ARE  YOU DOING? WHY? THAT MAKES NO SENSE. [ LAUGHTER ] WAS IT GETTING TOO EASY TO  POLICE ILLEGAL GUNS? WHAT IF WE DO IT WITH OUR ARMS  LIKE THIS? [ LAUGHTER ] ARE THERE ANY SOMEWHAT COME CALL  LIMITS ON -- COMICAL LIMITS ON  FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO ENDORSE FEDERAL LAW. NORMALLY I GET THAT THROUGH THE  EAR BUT THE KNEW -- PNEUMATIC  TUBE SYSTEM DIDN'T REALIZE THE QUESTION WAS RETOURICCAL. I'LL -- RHETORICAL. I'LL BITE. THE ATF ISN'T ALLOWED TO INSPECT  DEALERS MORE THAN ONCE A YEAR  AND IN REALITY GET TO INSPECT THEM ONCE EVERY 17 YEARS. I'M ASSUMING THAT'S BECAUSE IT  DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH AGENTS AND  NOT THAT THE ATF AGENTS ARE  CICADAS. [ LAUGHTER ] LET THAT INSECT JOKE JUST WASH  OVER YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, I GUESS SELF REPORT  INVENTORIES FROM DEALERS ARE  BETTER THAN NOTHING. WHAT IS THAT? OH, MY GOD! WHY IT'S GUNTHER MY MESSENGER  PIGEON. WE CAN'T RELY ON SELF REPORTED  INVENTORIES EITHER BECAUSE THE  ATF CANNOT REQUIRE DEALERS TO KEEP TRACK OF THEIR OWN INVEN  TOURISM A CONGRESSMAN STUCK AN  AMENDMENT INTO A FEDERAL SPENDING BILL THAT RESTRICTED  THE ATF'S ABILITY TO DO WHAT THE  NRA SAID THEY SHOULD DO. IT REQUIRED THE DESTRUCTION OF  BACKGROUND CHECK RECORDS WITHIN  24 HOURS. YOU KNOW, TO MAKE SURE NO  MISTAKES COULD BE CORRECTED. [ LAUGHTER ] WHO DID THIS? WHAT CONGRESSMAN JAMMED THIS  AMENDMENT INTO AN UNRELATED  SPENDING BILL COMPLETELY CASTRATING THE ATF'S ABILITY TO  ENFORCE GUN LAWS.
THE AMENDMENT WITH YOUR NAME  TIAHRT.
IT WAS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO  PROTECT US.
Jon: HOLY (bleep) YOU ARE  THE GUY FROM FIVE MINUTES AGO  SAYING SLOW DOWN MUNICIPALITIES THE ATF HAS THE ENFORCEMENT  GAME, LET THE ATF HANDLE IT AND  THEN -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HAVE BROKEN MY TEA HEART. WEE. THE AMENDMENT COULDN'T BE WORSE  IF THE NRA WROTE IT THEMSELVES. OH, BOY. NO! GUNTHER, WHY? WHY WOULD YOU BE IN THE TUBE? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU ARE NEVER SUPPOSED TO CROSS  ANTIQUATED MESSAGE DELIVERY  SYSTEMS LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] THE NRA DID WRITE THAT LAW. WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE THE ATF HAS  BEEN COMPLETELY DEBALLED. THANKS TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT  THEY HAVE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL THAT  THEY USE TO ENCOURAGE GUN OWNERS TO ACT RESPONSIBLY.
THOUGH IT'S NOT REQUIRED BY  FEDERAL LAW ATF SUGGESTS YOU  CONDUCT A COMPLETE FIREARMS INVENTORY ONCE A YEAR.
IF YOU HAVE A BUYER THAT  APPEARS TO BE UNDER THE INCLUDE  OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL AND IT APPEARS THEIR JUDGMENT MAY BE  IMPAIRED, YOU MAY WANT TO DENY  THE SALE. NOT BECAUSE IT'S A VIOLATION OF  THE GUN CONTROL ACT BUT BECAUSE  THAT PERSON'S JUDGMENT IS LIKELY  IMPAIRED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S UP  TO YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT OUR JOB AT THE ATF TO TELL  YOU YOU CAN'T SELL GUNS TO DRUNK  PEOPLE. I WILL SAY THIS THOUGH TO THE  GUN DEALERS YOU CAN SELL THE GUN  TO THE DRUNK PEOPLE BUT IF THOSE (b
