FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW" MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, TONIGHT'S PROGRAM --  TONIGHT'S PROGRAM IS ONE YOU'LL  ENJOY. OUR GUEST A WOMAN WHO  SKYROCKETING TO FAME BY  (bleep) IN A SINK -- [ LAUGHTER ] DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN WILL BE ON  THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] MELISSA McCARTHY WE'RE VERY  EXCITED. LET'S BEGIN ON THE CONSERVATIVE  MOVEMENT. ASK ANY ROCK-RIBBED CONSERVATIVE  AND THEY SAY.
WE THE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO  DECIDE HOW TO LIVE OUR LIVES  TRCHLZ A PARTER FOR INDIVIDUAL  FREEDOM.
IT REALLY IS LIBERTY VERSUS  TYRANNY.
I DON'T WANT A BIGGER  GOVERNMENT TELLING US HOW TO  LIVE OUR LIVES.
ORDER US AROUND, TRAM. OUR FREEDOMS.
GET OUT OF OUR LIVES MR. NANNY STATE.
Jon: PLEASE, MR. NANNY  STATE IS MY FATHER. CALL ME JON. BY THE WAY, MR. NANNY STATE THE  NAME OF MY ILL FATED 1994  ATTEMPT AT A FAMILY COMEDY POLITICAL THRILLER. [ LAUGHTER ] FIRST MOVIE THAT WENT DIRECT TO  YOUR TOILET BUT THE PRINCIPLE  STILL STANDS WHAT SEPARATES CONSERVATIVES FROM LIBERALS IS  CONSERVATIVES THINKS GOVERNMENT  IS BAD AND PEOPLE ARE GOOD. UNLESS THE PEOPLE WORK IN  GOVERNMENT THEN THEY ARE BAD. BUT THEY CAN LEAVE GOVERNMENT,  GO TO A LOBBYING FIRM AND BECOME  GOOD AGAIN. IT'S A COMPLICATED THEORY. BUT FREEDOM LOVES HAVE A PLAN TO  CARVE OUT A HAVEN OF LIBERTY,  SAFE FROM THE TYRANTS.
THERE'S A MOVE IN IDAHO BY A  GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO  START THE COMMUNITY.
THEY ARE CALL IT THE SIT  ADELE.
IT'S FAMILIES THAT CHOOSE TO  LIVE TOGETHER IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THOMAS JEFFERSON'S IDEAL OF RIGHTFUL LIBERTY.
Jon: THOMAS JEFFERSON'S  RIGHTFUL IDEAL OF LIBERTY. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A CLIP OF HIM  EXPLAINING THAT.
LAW IS THE TYRANT'S WILL AND  ALWAYS SO WHEN IT VIOLATES THE  RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SO WHAT WOULD THIS  LOOK LIKE?
THEY WOULD BUILD A HUGE  PERIMETER AROUND THE WHOLE  THING, SEVERAL SMALLER PERIMETERS, TURRETS AND TOWERS. THEY SAY THAT THEY MAY FIND  LIVING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY IS  INCATIBLE WITH THEIR EXISTING IDEA YOJ.
Jon: REALLY LESS OF A  JEFFERSONIAN IEW TOAP WHY AND  FREEDOM PANIC ROOM. NOT SURE IT'S THE OPTION FOR THE  RETURN TO LIB BER TISM SOMEBODY  HAS TO SHOW THE LIB RANLZ PROGRESSIVE WHAT'S REAL FREEDOM  LOOKS LIKE. ANY TAKER?
WHAT I DO IS STAND FOR THOSE  WILLING TO RISK THEIR LIVES FOR  MAN'S FREEDOM, MAN'S LIBERTY SO THEY CAN PURSUE HAPPY YNS.
Jon: YOU SIR, THERE IN THE  BEAUTIFUL JACKET WITH MATCHING  HINTS OF EMOTIONAL FRAGILITY, THAT'S GLENN BECK, THE GUY WHO  LOVES FREEDOM TOO MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A TV SHOW  ANYMORE. HE LIVES ON THE INTERNET WHERE  LAWS HAVE NO MEANINGS AND CATS  CAN HAVE CHEESEBURGERS. [ LAUGHTER ] IF ONLY SOMEONE LIKE GLENN BECK  WOULD BUILD ONE OF THESE FREEDOM  TOWNS.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT I  WANT TO LEAVE FUTURE  GENERATIONS. TONIGHT IN THE AMERICAN  DREAMLAND.
Jon: OH, BOY, HERE WE GO.
INDEPENDENT U.S.A. IT'S AN ENTIRE CITY DEVELOPED  AROUND PATTERNS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I CALL IT ARGYLEVILLE. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOT TO RAIN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BEAUTIFUL TOWN. NOT TO RAIN ON THE FUTURE  GENERATIONS BUT AREN'T PATTERNS  PRETTY MUCH THE OPPOSITE OF  FREEDOM? THEY ARE ALL BILLION  REGIMENTATION. THE REPEATINGING PATTERN IS WHAT  MAKES PLAYED PLAYED AND NOT --  I'M SURE I'M MISUNDERSTANDING, GLENN BECK --
TRUE FREEDOM GRANTS CITIZENS  THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND YOU  CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE ELSE MAKING THE DECISIONS. WE DON'T WANT THE STATE TELLING  HOUSE TO LIVE OUR LIVES. I WANT MY FREEDOM AND MY CHOICES  BACK.
Jon: YES, FREEDOM AND  CHOICES BACK! TAKE US, SIR, TO THIS NEW PLACE  OF FREEDOM AND CHOICES WHERE THE  NANNY STATE CAN NO LONGER SMOTHER US UNDER THE GIANT  TYRANNY.
THIS IS RIGHT HERE THE  MARKETPLACE. THE MARKETPLACE IS WHERE  PEOPLE -- THERE'S NOT GOING BE  GAP HERE. THERE'S NO ANN TAYLOR. YOU WANT AN ANN TAYLOR, GO SOME  PLACE ELSE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: EXCUSE ME, SIR. FREEDOM TOWN SOUNDS GREAT. I LIKE THE PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM  AND LIBERTY, BUT WHERE WILL I  GET MY CASUAL BASICS. GAP AND ANN TAYLOR NOT ALLOWED  IN THE MARKET DRIVEN  INDEPENDENT. NO WORD ON ANN TAYLOR LOST. YOU CAN PICK UP MIX AND MATCH  PIECES FOR THE OFFICE. THE PRICE POINT, WHICH I CAN  ASSURE IS ALMOST -- [ LAUGHTER ] THE POINT IS. I THOUGHT Y'ALL HATED CENTRAL  PLANNING. REMEMBER? THE RIGHT, FREEDOM, THE LEFT  CENTRAL PLANNING AND TYRANNY.
GET YOUR DAMN HANDS OFF MY  FRIES, LADY. IF I WANT TO BE A FATTY, AND  SHOVEL FRENCH FRIES ALL DAY LONG  IT'S MY CHOICE.
Jon: YES! AND WHILE FRENCH FRIES HAVE BEEN  LEGAL, CHEAP AND UBIQUITOUS,  POINT TAKEN. TELL BUTS BUFFET.
WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH  FOOD. IT NEEDS TO BE LOCAL.
Jon: (bleep) THAT! GET YOUR DAMN HANDS OFF THE  FRENCH FRIES LAIDISM UNLESS, YOU  KNOW WHAT I'M SORRY. I GUESS YOU ARE TRYING TO DO  WHAT IS GOOD FOR EVERYBODY. I THINK YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WANTED  TO DO WHAT WAS GOOD FOR  EVERYBODY.
HITLER WAS A VEGETARIAN. WANTED TO TAKE AND SPREAD THE  GLORIES OF VEGETARIANISM AND  SAYING IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY WE SHOULD EAT THIS.
Jon: I WAS GOING TO SAY  JESUS BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO  THERE -- UM -- ANYWAY. SO WAIT, WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE WILL HAPPEN IN THE  TOWN THAT YOU BUILT TO GET AWAY  FROM THE NANNY STATE?
WE WANT TO MAKE REAL MOVIES  AND REAL TELEVISION WITH ONE  THAT DOESN'T CONSTANTLY ASSAULT THE THINGS THAT WE ALL STAND  FOR, REDESIGN OUR RESIDENTIAL  AREAS. TAKE THE CONCRETE OUT OF THE  STREET AND REPLACE THAT WITH  GRASS. THERE'S NO REAL STREETS IN FRONT  OF THE HOUSES. IT'S A PARK A WAY TO INTERACT  WITH NEIGHBORS, NOT BURY  OURSELVES IN THE BACKYARD.
Jon: EVERYONE GETS A YARD  FOR COMMUNITY KICKBALL GAMES! [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD BE A CAPTAIN! HOLY SHISA! ALL THAT IS LEFT IS A PLAN TO  BREAK DOWN CLASS BEARERS AND YOU  HAVE A PERFECT MARXIST UTOPIA  GOING.
WE CAN FIRST OF ALL BREAK THE  CLASS BARRIERS -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SORRY. OKAY. SO ACTUALLY THE COMMUNAL FRONT  YARD WOULD BE FUN. FOURTH OF JULY BLOCK PARTIES  EVERYBODY HANGING OUT, HOTTING  DOGS, LISTENING TO SPRINGSTEEN, DRINKING BEERth WE PLAN ON  REDESIGNING THE JULY 4th  HOLIDAY TO GET AWAY FROM  HOTDOGS, BORN IN THE U.S.A. AND FIREWORKS AND BEER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU ARE TOUGH, YOU ARE  TOUGH DUDE. YOU JUST TAKE AWAY MY HOT DOGS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU CAN TAKE WAY MY HOT DOGS. YOU CAN TAKE AWAY MY FIREWORKS  AND MY BEER BUT YOU WILL NEVER  TAKE MY SPRINGSTEEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOOK, WE ALL KNOW GLENN BECK IS  NEVER GOING TO BUILD BECK OPOLIS  OR BECK TOPIA OR BEKAA DO YOU KNOW OR.
BECKY, BECKY --
Jon: BUT HIS VISION FOR  THIS TOWN TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT  THE FREEDOM FETISHES WHO SWEAR AT EVERY TURN THAT THE OPPONENTS  WHO WANT TO GOVERN  DEMOCRATICALLY ARE TYRANNICAL ASSAULT ASSAULTS IN OUR FREEDOM. THEY DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN  FREEDOM TO, THEY BELIEVE IN  FREEDOM FROM LIBERALS, PEOPLE THEY DISAGREE WITH, FROM THE  SENSIBLY PRICED CLOTHING OF ANN  TAYE ALREADY. [ LAUGHTER ] THESE FOLKS CLOAK THEMSELVES  UNTIL PATRIOTISM PRETENDING THEY  CAN REVEAL THE TRUE INTEND OF OUR CONSTITUTION THEY ARE JUST  ANOTHER (bleep) NEIGHBORHOOD  ASSOCIATION WHOSE NOSTALGIC UTOPIA WILL FALL PART THE MINUTE  SOMEBODY DECIDES TO PAINT THEIR  HOUSE MAUVE. IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE IN THE  BACKYARD, EATING HOT DOGS  DRINKING BEER AND BLASTING THIS. ♪ ♪  NO, IT'S A MIX TAPE, CAN YOU  SKIP AHE
