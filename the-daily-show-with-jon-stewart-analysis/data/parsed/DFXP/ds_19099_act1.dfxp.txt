FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. TONIGHT'S GUEST THE GREATEST, THE GREATEST RELIEF PITCHER IN BASEBALL HISTORY MARIANO RIVERA IS GOING TO BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM LATER ON TONIGHT. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT BUT -- [LAUGHTER] I SAID THE BUT REALLY LOUD, DIDN'T I? I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT, SCARED SOME PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE NEWS. BECAUSE LATE LAST WEEK IT ALL WENT DOWN.
THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE DEFENSE OVER A NEW SMOKING GUN BENGHAZI E-MAIL.
SOME ARE CALLING A SMOKING GUN.
THE SMOKING GUN.
Jon: SMOKING GUN. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S ONE OF WORST KINDS OF GUNS. [LAUGHTER] A GUN THAT SMOKES. ITS A TERRIBLE INFLUENCE. [LAUGHTER] ALL THE OTHER GUNS THAT JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME. THEY ARE NOT SMOKING, NOT DRINKING AND THEN THAT GUN WALKS IN. COME ON, ALL THE COOL GUNS ARE DOING IT. [ LAUGHTER ]  NOW WE WENT INTO IRAQ BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT THE SMOKING GUN TO BE IN THE FORM OF A MUSHROOM CLOUD. WHAT WAS THIS GUN SMOKING?
THE CONSERVATIVE WATCH DOG GROUP JUDICIAL WATCH OBTAINED INTERNAL WHITE HOUSE E-MAILS THAT IT CLAIMS REVEAL MORE ABOUT THE EFFORT TO GET THEN U.N. AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE TO ASSERT ON THE SUNDAY MORNING TALK SHOWS THAT THE ATTACK ON THE U.S. CONSULATE WAS THE RESULT OF A DEMONSTRATION OVER AN INTERNET VIDEO AND NOT A FAILURE OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY.
Jon: HUH. MAN, THAT IS DIFFERENT. THE WHITE HOUSE HAD SAID THEY HAD VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH CHANGING THE TALKING POINTS. WELL, NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THIS BEN RHODES A WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY AND COMMUNICATIONS AIDE DID ADD TO THE TALKING POINTS, EMPHASIZING THAT THE PROTESTS SURROUNDING THE BENGHAZI VIOLENCE WERE NOT COORDINATED BY TERRORISTS BUT WERE INSTEAD SOMEHOW RELATED TO A PROVOCATIVE ANTI-MUSLIM VIDEO THAT HAD CAUSED DEMONSTRATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. BY THE WAY, THAT VIDEO, SNOW DOGS. IT REALLY IS A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE VIDEO. [LAUGHTER] WELL, I WILL SAY THIS, FROM THAT E-MAIL IT SOUNDS LIKE THE WHITE HOUSE -- WELL DONE. THE WHITE HOUSE HAD POLITICS AND ELECTIONS ON THEIR MIND WHEN THEY SENT SUSAN RICE TO THE SUNDAY SHOWS. IT'S DEPLORABLE. NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANS IN TERMS OF FIXING THE INITIAL PROBLEMS OF INADEQUATE COMMUNICATION AND PROTECTION THAT CAUSED THE TRAGEDY BUT OKAY. GOOD FIND. MOVING ON.
WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE OVER THOSE FOUR DEAD AMERICANS? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WAIT, WHAT NOW?
WE NOW KNOW THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAD A CONSPIRACY WHERE ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO WAS CHANGE THE STORY.
WILL THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVEN PAY ATTENTION?
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS GIVING PRESIDENT OBAMA A PASS ON BENGHAZI. WHERE WAS THAT OUTRAGE? THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE CREATED A POLITICAL AGENDA.
WHERE IS THE MEDIA OUTRAGE?
THEY KNEW IT WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK FROM THE GET GO.
NOBODY SEEMS TO CARE.
FOX NEWS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT STAYED ON THE STORY AND HAS NOT LET GO OF IT.
WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE THERE? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OKAY. I THINK I SEE THE PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU THINK PEOPLE'S FAILURE TO MATCH YOUR LEVEL OF OUTRAGE IS BASED ON IGNORANCE THAT AFTER NEARLY 100 NETWORK NEWS STORIES, HUNDREDS OF CABLE NEWS STORIES ABOUT BENGHAZI 13 CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS, 50 FURTHER CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFINGS AND 25,000 PAGES OF OFFICIAL FINDINGS CONCERNING WHAT HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI THAT IF WE ALL ONLY KNEW ABOUT IT -- [LAUGHTER] -- WE WOULD CARE. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS WE'VE HEARD MORE ABOUT IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. THE ONLY THING WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. THE ONLY THING WE'VE HEARD MORE ABOUT MAYBE THE KARDASHIANS AND THERE IS,  THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT THIS SITUATION WAS SPAWNED BY THE RELEASE OF THE VIDEO. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT -- I THINK I SEE THE PROBLEM. HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM, YOU ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO GET OUTRAGED ABOUT AN INTELLIGENCE FAILURE THAT TRAGICALLY LED TO SOME AMERICANS LOSING THEIR LIVES. ONE INTELLIGENCE FAILURE. AND THEN, I MEAN, IMAGINE THE OUTRAGE IF THERE WAS A SECOND FAILURE RIGHT AFTER THAT ONE THAT TRAGICALLY LED TO EVEN MORE AMERICANS LOSING THEIR LIVES? BUT, YOU ARE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. YOU ARE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ONE INTELLIGENCE FAILURE AND YOU ARE UPSET THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IN ITS HASTE TO GET REELECTED PULLED SOME DODGY FACE SAVING (bleep). THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE AFRAID OF. WELL, I COMMEND YOU FOR FINALLY GETTING IN TOUCH WITH YOUR INNER OUTRAGE BECAUSE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, IN THE PREVIOUS DECADE IT WAS AN EMOTION YOU DIDN'T SEEM COMFORTABLE ADDRESSING OR EXPRESSING. LIKE, FOR INSTANCE WHEN FORMER BUSH HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY TOM RIDGE SAID HE WAS PRESSURED BY ASHCROFT AND RUMSFELD TO RAISE THE NATION'S TERROR THREAT LEVEL BEFORE THE 2004 ELECTION TO HELP PRESIDENT BUSH'S ELECTION CHANCES. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT?
WELL, TOM RIDGE IS A GOOD AND DECENT MAN ENTITLED TO HIS IMPRESSIONS BUT THERE'RE JUST THAT AND THERE ARE SOME FACTS THAT STAND BETWEEN TOM RICH AND THE SMOKING GUN.
IF FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY CHIEF TOM RIDGE WAS HOPING TO GENERATE BUZZ ABOUT HIS UPCOMING BOOK, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
Jon: ZING. THAT'S NOT OUTRAGE. THAT IS SNARK. SNARK IS NOT OUTRAGE, SILLY.  [LAUGHTER] AND, WHEN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION PLANTED A STORY ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN BUYING ALUMINUM TUBES IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SO THAT THE SAME DAY THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR COULD GO ON TV AND SAY THIS.
THERE'S A STORY IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" THIS MORNING. REPORTING JUST THIS MORNING.
HIGH QUALITY ALUMINUM TUBES THAT ARE ONLY REALLY SUITED FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS.
Jon: THEY KNEW A YEAR IN ADVANCE THAT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING ON THE SHOW THAT DAY WAS NOT TRUE. WHERE WAS THAT OUTRAGE?
WHERE IS THE APOLOGY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THIS?
WHY SHOULD THERE BE AN APOLOGY. HINDSIGHT IS ALWAYS 20/20.
OF COURSE THEY'S GOING TO BE A DISSENTER. AND SAYING ALUMINUM TUBES AREN'T NUCLEAR MATERIAL AND THEN EIGHT OTHERS ARE SAYING IT IS. YOU MAKE A JUDGMENT.
IT'S A MATTER OF ASSUMPTION.
BUT NOT A QUESTION OF LYING.
Jon: NO, IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF LYING. IT'S A STATEMENT OF LYING. IT'S NOT AN ASSUMPTION BECAUSE -- NO, LET ME EXPLAIN,  WHEN YOU ASSUME -- [  APPLAUSE  ] -- ALL I KNOW IS WHEN YOU ASSUME IT MAKES AN ASS OUT OF -- THEY WERE LYING AND THEY KNEW THEY WERE LYING WHEN THEY SAID THAT. BUT NOW BENGHAZI AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE C.I.A. HAD INFORMATION THAT THINGS WERE DANGEROUS. SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE PERFECTION. THAT IS TRUE. MORE PROTECTION. I MEAN, IMAGINE THAT WOULD BE LIKE SENDING SOLDIERS TO THE FRONT LINES IN A WAR OF CHOICE WITHOUT PROPERLY UPARMORRED VEHICLES AND NOT ONLY TAKING WAY TOO LONG TO FIX THE PROBLEM BUT ANSWERING A SOLDIER'S QUESTION ABOUT THAT PROBLEM LIKE THIS.
AS YOU KNOW YOU GO TO WAR WITH THE ARMY YOU HAVE AND NOT THE ARMY YOU MIGHT WANT.
Jon: ZING. I FORGOT JUST HOW MUCH CATCH PHRASES CAME OUT OF IRAQ. I TELL YOU, THAT THING WAS THE LIKE STEVE ERKEL OF WARS. SO, IF YOU WERE UPSET ABOUT BENGHAZI THAT RUMSFELD THING MUST HAVE REALLY MASSAGED YOUR O SPOT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOUR OUTRAGE SPOT WHICH TOTALLY DOESN'T EXIST.
THEY WANT TO JUMP ON THE MILITARY, THEY WANT TO JUMP ON DON RUMSFELD, THEY WANT TO JUMP ON THE ADMINISTRATION. IT WAS A PLANT, IT WAS A PLANT BY THE MEDIA.
Jon: YEAH, THAT'S THE REAL OUTRAGE OF THAT RUMSFELD QUOTE THE MEDIA BASTARDS. I MEAN, WHY WOULD A GUY IN THE FRONTLINES IN IRAQ EVEN BE CONCERNED ABOUT NOT HAVING A PROPERLY UPARMORRED VEHICLE. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WAKE UP SHEEP-PLE. BUT, THAT'S JUST FOX NEWS. I'M SURE OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS LIKE YOUR LINDSEY GRAHAMS THERE, SEEMINGLY DEDICATED THE REST OF HIS CAREER TO KEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF THE FOUR WE LOST IN BENGHAZI WAS JUST AS OUTRAGED AND EAGER AT THIS FLAGRANT INABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR AMERICANS IN HARM'S WAY.
LET'S GET THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED. LET'S PRESS ON AND LEARN FROM OUR PAST MISTAKES. I DON'T WANT TO PAY POLITICS WITH THIS.
Jon: I WOULD MUCH RATHER PLAY A NICE GAME OF PINNACLE. RATHER THAN PLAY POLITICS, I WOULD RATHER PASS THIS LOVELY SOUTHERN AFTERNOON BEFORE COLONEL BEUREGARD ARRIVES TO ESCORT ME TO A BALL AT OUR MANOR. I DO DECLARE. IF I MAY SAY, YOUR HYPOCRITICAL OUTRAGE AND SANCTAMONY ASIDE, THE REASON IT'S HARD FOR EVERYONE TO GET OUTRAGED BY THIS TERRIBLY TRAGIC AND ULTIMATELY PREVENTABLE DISASTER THAT WAS BENGHAZI, IS THAT EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY HAS SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE ONLY THAT MOVIE WAS ON AN IMAX. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
