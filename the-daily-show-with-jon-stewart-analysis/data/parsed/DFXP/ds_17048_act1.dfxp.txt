JANUARY 23, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY KATHLEEN SEBELIUS. WE'RE GOING TO ASK HER ABOUT HEALTH. AND HUMAN SERVICES. HUMAN SERVICES. SOUNDS NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE. IT'S A COOK BOOK. ALL RIGHT. WE BEGIN, OF COURSE, WITH THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE. WE CHECKED IN LAST WEEK. WHEN WE DID IT SEEMED LIKE ROMNEY HAD THIS THING PRETTY SEWN UP.
MOST OF THE POLLS HAVE ROMNEY AHEAD IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
ROMNEY HAS A HUGE LEAD IN FLORIDA RIGHT NOW.
MITT ROMNEY IS THE JUGGERNAUT AT THIS POINT.
Jon: HE IS A JUGGERNAUT. HE CAN ONLY BE DEFEATED IF YOU REMOVE HIS HELMET. ANYBODY? SO WE WERE ALREADY PLANNING OUT ALL OUR PUNS FOR ROMNEY THROUGH THE GENERAL ELECTION. FOR ROMNEY'S CONVENTION SPEECH. FOR WHEN QUESTIONS WERE RAISED ABOUT ROMNEY'S BUSINESS BACKGROUND. IF ROMNEY'S RELIGION BECOMES AN ISSUE. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WE WERE SET. AND THEN SATURDAY NIGHT.
NEWT GINGRICH THE WINNER OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY.
VERY STUNNING GINGRICH WIN.
WON SOUTH CAROLINA WITH 40% OF THE VOTE. THE CLOSEST NEXT WAS ROMNEY WITH 28%.
Jon: GINGRICH SMOKED ROMNEY BY 12 POINTS. THAT'S BEATING HIM LIKE BY FOUR-GAMING WINNING OVERTIME FIELD GOALS. GO, GIANTS! (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  SORRY, SORRY, I HAD A LOT OF  FUN LAST NIGHT. HOW DID NEWT GINGRICH DO IT? LET ME EXPLAIN. HOW DID HE TURN IT AROUND? HERE'S HOW GINGRICH TURNED IT AROUND. AT THE DEBATE BEFORE SATURDAY'S FINAL VOTE, THE MODERATOR ASKED GINGRICH ABOUT  ACCUSATIONS BY HIS POSSIBLY MS- STRICKEN SECOND WIFE MARY ANN WHOM GINGRICH HAD LEFT FOR HIS  POSSIBLY CANCER-STRICKEN FIRST WIFE FOR... ALL RIGHT. WHEN THEY WERE MARRIED. THAT SOUNDS SO TERRIBLE. THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE WOMAN FOR WHOM HE HAD LEFT HIS CANCER-STRICKEN FIRST WIFE. THAT SOUNDS BETTER. ALL RIGHT. ANYWAY, GINGRICH WANTED WIFE 2 TO BE OPEN TO HIM HAVING SEX WITH YET ANOTHER LADY WITH  WHOM HE HAD ALREADY BEEN FOR SIX YEARS AND NOW HIS THIRD LADY, OUR POTENTIAL FIRST LADY ALL RIGHT. OKAY. SO HOW DID THIS HELP GINGRICH? ALL RIGHT. SOUTH CAROLINIANS ARE VALUES VOTERS. THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH VALUES. JUST WATCH THE DEBATE'S FIRST QUESTION.
AS YOU KNOW YOUR EX-WIFE GAVE AN INTERVIEW. IN IT SHE SAID YOU CAME TO HER IN 1999 AT A TIME WHEN YOU WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR. SHE SAID SHE ASKED YOU, SIR, TO ENTER INTO AN OPEN MARK.
Jon: GO ON.
SHE SAYS YOU ASKED HER, SIR, TO ENTER INTO AN OPEN MARRIAGE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE SOME TIME TO RESPOND TO THAT?
Jon: PREFERABLY IN "LETTER TO PENT HOUSE" FORM. HMMM? (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I KID. BECAUSE WHAT COMES NEXT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS THE MOMENT WHEN VALUES-VOTERS SPOZED DISGUST OVER THE MORAL  PERPENDICULAR TUD OF THOSE IN AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE IS KNOCKED OUT COLD BY THEIR  ANGER AT THE SUPPOSED VICTIMIZATION BY THE MEDIA.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE SOME TIME TO RESPOND TO THAT?
NO, BUT I WILL.
Jon: BUMP-BUMP-BUMP.
I AM APPALLED THAT YOU WOULD BEGIN A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ON A TOPIC LIKE THIS. I THINK THE DESTRUCTIVE, VICIOUS, NEGATIVE NATURE OF MUCH OF THE NEWS MEDIA MAKES IT HARDER TO GOVERN THIS  COUNTRY, TO TAKE AN EX-WIFE AND MAKE IT TWO DAYS BEFORE THE PRIMARY A SIGNIFICANT  QUESTION FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IS AS CLOSE TO DESPICABLE AS ANYTHING I CAN IMAGINE.
Jon: AS CLOSE TO DESPICABLE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE? YOU IMAGINED YOUR WIFE WHILE SHE WAS DEALING WITH HAVING MS WOULD BE OPEN TO YOU HAVING  SEX WITH ANOTHER LADY YOU HAVE BEEN HAVING SEX WITH FOR SIX (BEEP) YEARS. I THINK YOU HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IMAGINATION DECEMBER PICKABILITYWISE. HOW DARE YOU, SIR, HOW DARE YOU IN FRONT OF ALL THE GOOD PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA ASK  ME ABOUT SOMETHING AS TAWDRY AS MY THREE SOMEWHAT OVERLAPPING MARRIAGES. HOW DARE YOU. OH, MY GOD! JOHN KING IS GOING TO CRUSH THIS GUY. ALL HE HAS TO DO IS POINT OUT THE HYPOCRISY OF A FAMILY'S VALUE CREW CRUSADER WHO  PRESIDED OVER THE CLINTON SCAVENGER HUNT FINDING THAT KIND OF QUESTIONING OF A  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE UNSEEMLY. POINT OUT HYPOCRISY WHO INSISTS WHILE GAY PEOPLE WOULD SULLY THE SANTITY OF MARRIAGE  WHILE BEING A MARRIAGE SULLYER. HE IS A SHOT TO GET YOU IN A SUPER BOWL WITH MODERATORS.
AS YOU NOTED, MR. SPEAKER, THIS STORY DID NOT COME FROM OUR NETWORK. IT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE CAMPAIGN....
JOB, IT WAS REPEATED BY YOUR NETWORK. YOU CHOSE TO START THE DEBATE WITH IT. DON'T TRY TO BLAME SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU AND YOUR STAFF CHOSE TO START THIS DEBATE WITH IT.
Jon: OH, MY (BEEP) GOD. KING SANK IT. (MUMBLING) I HAD THE QUESTION AND I JUST READ IT (MUMBLING) THEN THEY ASKED ME TO READ THE QUESTION. WE'VE GOT THE MODERATOR, THE MODERATOR OF A DEBATE EVADING QUESTIONS NOW. THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. HOW WEIRD IS THIS WHOLE THING GETTING? LOOK WHAT GINGRICH, LOOK AT THE PLATFORM GINGRICH IS NOW RUNNING ON.
I'M HAPPY TO BE IN THE TRADITION OF RONALD REAGAN AS THE OUTSIDER WHO SCARES THE  REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT. I HAVE NO TIES TO THE POWER STRUCTURE. I WAS NEVER A LOBBYIST. NEWT GINGRICH AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER.
Jon: YOUR SMALL BUSINESS INVOLVES SELLING ACCESS TO THE INSIDES OF WASHINGTON. YOU'RE NOT A WASHINGTON INSIDER? NEWT, THE FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND FREDDIE MAC CONSULTING MILLIONAIRE ARE  "THE" WASHINGTON INSIDER. WHEN WASHINGTON GETS HIS PROSTATE CHECKED, IT TICKLES YOU. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  DID I SAY TICKLES? BUT IT IS CLEAR NOW THAT THIS IS A TWO-MAN RACE. ROMNEY AND GINGRICH IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL. SEEMS CRAZY BUT, WELL, AT LEAST REPUBLICANS HAVE GOT TO BE HAPPY.
NEWT GINGRICH HAS EMBARRASSED THE PARTY.
ROMNEY IS LOOKING SOULLESS. HE'S LOOKING LIKE A WOODEN MAN.
NEWT GINGRICH IS THE LEAST CONSERVATIVE OF THESE CANDIDATES AND THE LEAST ELECTABLE.
ROMNEY IS VERY UNEMOTIONAL VERY DETACHED.
NEWT IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE. HE SOLD US OUT ON TAXES.
MITT ROMNEY'S PROBLEM IS SOMEHOW HIS ROMNEYNESS.
MAYBE NOT HIS ROMNEYNESS BUT MAYBE HIS MITTNESS. (LAUGHING).
Jon: I THINK I CAN SETTLE THIS INTER-PARTY SQUABBLE. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. THEY'RE BOTH TERRIBLE. BUT IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, AREN'T YOU ALL NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SAYING THIS KIND OF STUFF TO THEM?
RONALD REAGAN HAD THAT 11th COMMANDMENT THAT REPUBLICANS SHOULDN'T ATTACK OTHER REPUBLICANS.
ACCORDING TO HIM THOU SHALT NOT BEAT UP OTHER REPUBLICANS.
I'M A RONALD REAGAN REPUBLICAN. I BELIEVE IN THE 11th COMMANDMENT.
Reporter: ONCE GINGRICH STARTED BREAKING THE ACTUAL COMMANDMENTS, THE PARTY JUST THOUGHT... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ... NO SENSE KEEPING THE MADE-UP  ONES EITHER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
