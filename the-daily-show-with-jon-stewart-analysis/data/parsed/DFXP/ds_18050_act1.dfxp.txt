Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  ANY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE ONE AND  ONLY CHRISTOPHER WALKEN. CHRISTOPHER WALKEN WILL BE  JOINING US IN A LITTLE BIT. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT LET ME  GET TO THIS RIGHT NOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YESTERDAY WAS A BIG DAY ON  CAPITOL HILL. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY  CLINTON APPEARED BEFORE OUR  NATION'S LAWMAKERS FINALLY ANSWER THE TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT  THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON IN  BENGHAZI IN SEPTEMBER. OF COURSE, SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO  HAVE TESTIFIED BACK IN DECEMBER  BUT KEPT POSTPONING IT FOR HEALTH ISSUES. [ LAUGHTER ] IT CAME TO BE REFERRED TO AS  THE --
THE BENGHAZI FLU.
APPARENTLY IT'S THE ACUTE  BENGHAZI ALLERGY.
Jon: WELL, THE BENGHAZI FLU  TURNED OUT TO BE A CEREBRAL  BLOOD CLOT POINT TAKEN. AS THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT AS TO  WHAT CAUSED THE COOING ALATES IN  THE CAP LARRYS IS FEAR OF  LAWMAKERS. QUESTIONS SUCH AS.
AT WHAT POINT IN TIME CAN OUR  ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT  FIRE SOMEONE WHOSE GROSS NEGLIGENCE LEFT FOUR AMERICANS  DEAD IN BENGHAZI. WHAT DOES THE WORD  RESPONSIBILITY MEAN TO YOU MADAM  SECRETARY.
Jon: WELL WEBSTERS DEFINES  RESPONSIBILITY AS WHY DON'T YOU  GO (bleep) YOURSELF. [  APPLAUSE  ] I'M SORRY THAT WAS FROM THE SHOW  "WEBSTER."  I'M NOT SAYING HILLARY CLINTON  OR THE STATE DEPARTMENT ARE BLAMELESS HERE. WE NEED A THOREAU INQUIRY AND  CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE  MISJUDGMENTS AND PURE  INCOMPETENCE THAT LED TO THE TRAGEDY BUT THIS HERE COMMITTEE  WEREN'T IT.
ON AUGUST 16 WE HAD THIS  CABLE THAT'S BEEN WIDELY  REPORTED A CLASSIFIED STATE DEPARTMENT CABLE WARNING THAT  THE BENGHAZI CONSULATE COULD NOT  WITHSTAND A COORDINATE ADD TACK. WERE YOU AWARE OF THIS AUGUST 16  CABLE?
1.43 MILLION CABLES A YEAR  COME TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT  THEY ARE ALL ADDRESSED TO AMERICA THEY DON'T ALL COME TO  ME THEY ARE REPORTED THROUGH THE  BUREAUCRACY.
Jon: LET ME ASK A QUESTION:   WERE THEY TIMEWARNER CABLES  BECAUSE THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THEY NEVER SHOWED UP. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SORRY FOR THAT. PLEASE, COME BACK AND RECONNECT  MY CABLE LIFE WITHOUT BUNT HEADS  IS NO LIFE AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] THE QUESTION WAS ASKED, IT WAS  ANSWERED. DID YOU SEE THE CABLE, I DIDN'T  SEE THE CABLES. WHICH CLEARLY MEANT IT NEEDED TO  BE ASKED A FEW MORE DOZEN TIMES.
DID YOU SEE THE CABLE ON I  BELIEVE IT WAS AUGUST 12.
WAS IT A SURPRISE TO YOU?
DID YOU SEE IT PERSONALLY?
HOW DID YOU RESPOND IT TO?
YOU DID NOT READ THE CABLES  FROM BENGHAZI AND AMBASSADOR  STEVENS.
CERTAINLY SOMEBODY WITHIN  YOUR OFFICE SHOULD HAVE SEEN  THAT CABLE.
Jon: YES, THEY SHOULD HAVE  AND THAT CONCLUDES THE (bleep)  SHERLOCK HEARING. SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT,  POPPED IT UPSTAIRS AND GIVEN THE  PEOPLE AT THE CONSULATE MORE  SECURITY. THAT'S A FAIR POINT THAT YOU  DON'T HAVE TO ALL IDENTICALLY  MAKE. THIS ABILITY CLINTONS'S FIRST GO  ROUND IN THE FINGER POINTING  RODEO. SHE'S MAGNEETO. IT WOULD BE ONLY APRIL PROIF  THEY HAD A METAL COMPONENT AND  IF IT DIDN'T EFFECT METAL BUT FINGERS FIGNEETO. JUST ROLE THE THING.
JUDGMENT ERRORS AND THE  PEOPLE NEED TO BE REPLACED,  FIRED AND NO LONGER IN A POSITION OF MAKING JUDGMENT  CALLS.
THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT  HAVE TO BE CUT LOOSE WHEN THEY  ARE NOT PERFORMING THEIR TASKS.
Jon: EXPLAIN YOURSELF MADAM  SECRETARY. WHY DIDN'T YOU FIRE ANYONE?
UNDER FEDERAL STATUTE AND  REGULATION, UNSATISFACTORY  LEADERSHIP IS NOT GROUNDS FOR FINDING A BREACH OF DUTY. I HAVE SUBMITTED LEGISLATION TO  THIS COMMITTEE, TO THE CONGRESS  TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.
Jon: AHHH.
WHY DID STATE NOT IMMEDIATELY  REVAMP OUR SECURITY PROTOCOLS  PRIOR TO THE SEPTEMBER 11  ATTACKS?
Jon: A-H A, MS., I HAVE ALL  THE ANSWERS WHY WASN'T THERE  MORE SECURITY.
I DIDN'T SEE THE QUESTIONS. I DIDN'T APPROVE THEM. I DIDN'T DENY THEM. THEY DIDN'T COME TO AMERICA  WE'VE ASKED TO HELP REALLOCATE  FUNDS. THE SPHAT HAS GIVEN US THAT  AUTHORITY. WE DON'T HAVE IT FROM THE HOUSE  TO GET MORE MARINE GUARDS AND  DIPLOMATIC SECURITY GUARDS.
Jon: WHOOOO SON OF A BITCH! YOU KNOW WHAT? WE LIVE IN POLARIZED TIMES SO  THE REPUBLICANS COULD NOT  CONTAIN THE INSTINCTS COT DEMOCRATS BRING IT TO A MORE  CONSTRUCTIVE PLACE.
YOU HAVE REPRESENTED OUR  COUNTRY WITH TREMENDOUS STRENGTH  AND POISE.
THE WAY YOU'VE WORKED, THE  TIRELESS EFFORT YOU'VE HAD.
REMARKABLE SKILLS AND  STAMINA.
OPENNESS AND THOUGHTFULNESS  TODAY.
YOU SAID EARLIER WE HAVEN'T  DONE ENOUGH PROMOTING OURSELVES  AROUND THE WORLD. I THINK YOU HAVE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR A  WORKER IN THIS TOWN, LET ME  KNOW.
Jon: MS. CLINTON WOULD YOU  MAKE US THE LUCKIEST COMMITTEE  IN THE WORLD? SORRY, DID I SAY CONSTRUCTIVE I  MEANT ASS-LICKY. YOU HAVE THE SECRETARY OF STATE  UNDER OATH AND YOU ARE FISHING  FOR RESTAURANT RECOMMENDATIONS EVEN PAULA ABDUL IS WATCHING  THIS GOING JESUS, GO A LITTLE  HARDER ON HER. [ LAUGHTER ] IT APPEARED DEMOCRATS SAW THIS  AS AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TO  QUESTION HER BUT TO INTERVIEW FOR PERHAPS A FUTURE POSITION.
I SALUTE YOU AND LOOK AHEAD  TO 2016 WIRK YOU SUCCESS AND  EXTENDED TO YOU MY HIGHEST  REGARDS.
Jon: (bleep). OH, MY GOD -- WAIT A MINUTE  THERE'S NO AMERICAN SAMOA  DELEGATE ON THE COMMITTEE. I KNEW IT IT'S NOTED  UBER-PRANKSTER RONAIAH  TUIASOSOPO! TUIASOSOPO, I KNEW IT WAS  YOU-ASOSOPO FROM THAT  CLUE-ASOSOPO. FOR I AM RUBBER AND YOU ARE  GLUE-ASOSOPO. THERE'S AN AMERICAN SEW MOWAN  DELEGATE ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS  COMMITTEE. I WANTED TO DO FOUR STRAIGHT  DAYS OF THAT BIT, YOU KNOW,  CARRY IT THROUGH-ASOSOPO. I'M GOING TO PISS THAT STORY. AS THE BIG TAKE AWAY FROM THE  DAY APPEARS TO BE AN OUT OF  CONTEXT SOUND BITE.
WAS IT BECAUSE OF A PROTEST  OR GUYS OUT FOR A WALK ONE NIGHT  BECAUSE THEY DECIDED TO GO KILL  AMERICANS. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
Jon: SHE'S SAYING THERE'S  NO REASON TO INVESTIGATE THE  CAUSE OF THE ATTACK. THAT'S GOING TO GET TRACTION.
IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE. SHE APPEARED IT DOESN'T MATTER  WHO IS BEHIND THE ATTACK.
IT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE WHO  HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS,  FOLLOWING THIS, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO KNEW WHAT AND WHEN.
THE REASON WE'RE THERE IS  BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT  HAPPENED STILL TODAY.
Jon: EXACTLY. THIS INQUIRY IS TO FIGURE OUT  WHAT HAPPENED AND DO EVERYTHING  WE CAN TO PREVENT IT FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN, DOESN'T HILLARY  CLINTON UNDERSTAND THAT?
WHAT DIFFERENCE AT THIS POINT  DOES IT SNAKE IT IS OUR JOB TO  FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND DOLL EVERYTHING WE CAN -- AND DO  EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT IT  FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN,  SENATOR.
Jon: DAMN YOU NEXT LINE! DAMN YOU TO HELL! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE DOES UNDERSTAND THAT. IF HILLARY IS MINIMIZING THE  TRAGEDY THE LAWS OF CONSERVATION  AND MATTER OF ENERGY MEANS SOMETHING ON THE COMMITTEE WOULD  BALANCE WITH EQUAL HYPERBOLE.
I THINK YOU ACCEPT THE CULL. ABILITY FOR THE WORST TRAGEDY  SINCE 9/11.
Jon: SOMEONE IS FORGETTING  IRAQ BUT DONE. ORDER IS RESTORED TO THE
