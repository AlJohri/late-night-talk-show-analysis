FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  IT'S ME! WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW."  MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FILM  MAKERS BEHIND THE NEW MOVIE "PUSSY RIOT."  CALM DOWN. ( LAUGHTER )  IT'S ABOUT RUSSIAN POLITICAL  DISSIDENTS AND THEIR ADORABLE  CATS. ( LAUGHTER )  FIRST THINGS FIRST, LAST MONDAY  WAS MEMORIAL DAY, SO LIKE MOST  AMERICANS, WE TOOK THE WHOLE WEEK OFF. YOU'RE WELCOME. ( LAUGHTER )  ONE BELEAGUERED GOVERNMENT  BUREAU, THE I.R.S., SPENT THE  WEEK FURTHER MIRED IN A SCANDAL THAT STEMS FROM ACCUSATIONS THAT  ITS AGENTS PARTICULARLY TARGETED  RIGHT WING GROUPS FOR SCRUTINY.
MORE EMBARRASSMENT THIS  MORNING FOR THE I.R.S.
THE I.R.S. IS FACING ANOTHER  HEADACHE.
THE I.R.S. IS UNDER SCRUTINY  BIG TIME.
Jon:  OH, NO! ( LAUGHTER )  POOR BABIES. THE I.R.S. FACING SCRUTINY. ( LAUGHTER )  PEOPLE GETTING ALL UP. JUST BECAUSE ONE SMALL AREA OF  THEIR BUSINESS RAISED A COUPLE  OF RED FLAGS. NOW, EVERYBODY AT THE I.R.S. HAS  TO STOP THEIR LIVES AND PROVE  THEIR INNOCENCE. ( LAUGHTER )  OR PERHAPS WE CAN PUT THAT IN  TERMS THE I.R.S. MIGHT  UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES. IT'S OUR NEW SEGMENT, "WHERE'S  YOUR RESEE THE AT?"  SUCKS TO GET AUDITED, DOESN'T  IT? SUDDENLY, ACTIONS THAT SEEM  HARMLESS CAN BE PAINTED IN A  NEFARIOUS LIGHT. WELL, WHY DON'T WE SEE WHAT  WE'VE GOT. LET'S GET STARTED.
THIS MAN, FORMER I.R.S. COMMISSIONER, DOUGLAS SCHULMAN  VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE--  READY-- 157 TIMES. WHAT THE HECK? WAS THERE SCHULMAN DOING AT THE  WHITE HOUSE WITH THAT KIND OF  FREQUENCY?
Jon:  WOE! WOE! CAREER THE LADIES FROM THE ROOM! I.R.S., YOUR TOO MANY FOOLERY  ALMOST MADE BILL O'REILLY SAY H,  E, DOUBLE TOOTHPICKS.
YOU MUST EXPLAIN UNDER OACT  WHAT YOU WERE DOING AT THE WHITE  HOUSE ON 157 SEPARATE OCCASIONS.
Jon:  YEAH, THAT WAS A  LOT. ESPECIALLY SINCE HAVING THE  PRESIDENT TO TELL YOU TO USE THE  POWER OF THE I.R.S. TO DESTROY HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES ON THE  RIGHT SHOULD REALLY ONLY TAKE  ABOUT ONE MEETING, TWO TOPS. ( LAUGHTER )  THE FIRST MEETING WILL BE LIKE,  "HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TARGET MY  POLITICAL ENEMIES?" THEN THE NEXT 156 YOU'RE LIKE,  DYOU TAKE CARE OF THAT THING?"  ( LAUGHTER ). IT IS A GOOD QUESTION, WHAT WAS  THE I.R.S. CHAIRMAN DOING AT THE  WHITE HOUSE SO MANY TIMES?
MANY OF THOSE MEETINGS WERE  FOR HEALTH CARE IMPLEMENTATION. I WAS IN THEM WITH HIM. SO THERE'S NOTHING NEFARIOUS  GOING ON.
Jon:  NOTHING NEFARIOUS. CAN'T GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SIT  AROUND THE TABLE PICKING NAMES  OF SENIORS OUT OF A HAT SO THAT IT CAN SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GIVE  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN THEIR  BIRTH CONTROL. WITHOUT EVERYONE GETTING ALL  "WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?"  YEAH, WELCOME TO AUDIT WORLD,  I.R.S. BY THE WAY, KEVIN COSTNER'S  SECOND WORST MOVIE. ( APPLAUSE )  IT IS A TIME ON EARTH. MAN LIVES IN A CITY OF FORMS. IT'S A WORLD DROWNING IN  PAPERWORK. ( LAUGHTER )  SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH  ODDTING, I.R.S. YOU MAY HAVE PERFECTLY  REASONABLE EXPLANATIONS FOR  EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TOOK. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T NEED  YOU TO GO BACK HOME AND DIG  THROUGH ANOTHER COUPLE OF SHOE BOXES UNTIL WE GET ONE DOCUMENT  THAT WE REALLY NEED TO SEE  BEFORE WE CAN BE OKAY. WHY? THAT'S WHY. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  AND HERE'S THE OTHER THING ABOUT  AUDIT WORLD--  ( LAUGHTER ) I AM LUCKY I'M LEAVING THE  COUNTRY SOON. ( LAUGHTER )  HERE'S THE OTHER THING ABOUT  AUDIT WORLD. WHILE WE'RE ALL BUSY LOOKING FOR  THE SMOKING GUN ON THE  GOVERNMENT TARGETING SCANDAL, WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE WE MIGHT  FIND?
THIS VIDEO MADE BY I.R.S. EMPLOYEES TO CLOSE OUT A 2010  I.R.S. CONFERENCE. ACCORDING TO THE VIDEO'S  NARRATOR THOSE TAKING PART ARE  COMPETING TO BECOME THE NEXT GREAT DANCE SENSATION.
WE'RE TOLD THE CUPID DANCE  VIDEO COST $1600 TO MAKE.
Jon:  TWO THINGS--  ( LAUGHTER ). FIRST, AFTER WATCHING THAT  VOORKS I'M PRETTY CONVINCED IT  WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THE I.R.S. TO COORDINATE ANYTHING. ( LAUGHTER )  LET ALONE A MACHIAVELLIAN  POLITICAL PLOT. AND, NUMBER TWO, HOW THE  ( BLEEP ) DID THAT COST $1600? ( LAUGHTER )  DID THE GUY RECORDING IT DROP  HIS iPHONE THREE TIMES? ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  $1600! THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT BAD. YOU WRITE THAT OFF AS A MORALE  BOOSTER, IT'S OKAY.
$60,000 TO MAKE A PAIR OF  DIFFERENT VOOZ, SPOOFS OF  "GILLIGAN'S ISLAND" AND "STAR TREK."  ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  THOSE MAY BE THE  WORST PARODIES I'VE EVER SEEN. THEY REALLY--  ( APPLAUSE )  IT ACTUALLY GIVES ME A LOT  MORE-- LET ME SAY THIS. I ACTUALLY NOW HAVE A LOT MORE  RESPECT FOR THE DIRECTORS OF  "HOW I WET YOUR MOTHER." YOU KNOW, $1600. REALLY? GOING TO TAKE THAT DOWN, HUH? 1600 THERE, 60 GRAND THERE. ANY OTHER BUSINESS EXPENSES YOU  WANT TO TRY TO DEDUCT, I.R.S.?
THE I.R.S. SPENT ROUGHLY $49  MILLION ON 220 EMPLOYEE  CONFERENCES. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  HOLY ( BLEEP ). YOU SPENT ALMOST $50 MILLION ON  220 CONFERENCES? THAT'S--  ( LAUGHTER )  THAT'S ONLY IN THREE YEARS. THAT WORKS OUT TO, LIKE, $8  MILLION A CONFERENCE. ( LAUGHTER )  OH, THAT'S NOT ON. ( LAUGHTER )  ALL RIGHT. IT'S ACTUALLY-- I THAIT THAT WAS  ON. I THOUGHT I HAD IT ON. IT'S $250,000 PER CONFERENCE. EVEN THE GUYS WHO THROW THE  PLAYERS' BALL ONLY SPEND, LIKE,  20 GRAND AND THEY'RE DRINKING OUT OF ONE OF THESE. ( LAUGHTER )  YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T CARE,  I.R.S., IF YOU KEPT THE RECEIPT. EVEN IF THE CONFERENCES WERE FOR  A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS EXPENSE--  YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS AUDIT'S GOING TO ACHE A  WHILE I.R.S. AND THERE'S ONLY  ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE I KNOW OF WHO CAN HELP YOU THROUGH IT.
ARE YOU BEING AUDITED? THE TAX MASTERS WILL SOLVE YOUR  TAX PROBLEMS.
Jon:  WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
