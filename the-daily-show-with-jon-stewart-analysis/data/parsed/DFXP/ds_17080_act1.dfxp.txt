APRIL 2, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BOOM. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. MY GUEST, MOHAMMED NASHEED, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE MALDIVES. AND CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVISTS. CLIMATE CHANGE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MALDIVES BECAUSE THEY WERE ALMOST UNDERWATER. I WAS IN WASHINGTON D.C. THIS WEEK AT THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE UNIVERSITY. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOCIAL CAUSES  AND COMMIT MANYS THAT THEY'RE ALL WORKING ON FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND ALL OVER THE  WORLD WERE GATHERED THERE. I MET THIS KID WHO HAD MADE... HE AND HIS TWO FRIENDS MADE BAMBOO BICYCLES. IT WON THE LITTLE COMPETITION THEY HAD AMONGST ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS. INCREDIBLE. BACK STAGE HE SAYS TO ME, HEY, LISTEN, YOU KNOW, I'M FROM THE G.W.SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING. WE'RE HAVING OUR COMMENCEMENT. I WAS LIKE, HERE WE GO. YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO EXPLAIN NOW I THINK I'M BUSY THAT... THAT SEASON. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? HE GOES, SO, DO YOU KNOW NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON? COULD YOU ASK HIM IF HE WOULD DO OUR COMMENCEMENT? SO, CONSIDER HIM ASKED. NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON, G.W.SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING. THEY MAKE BAMBOO BIKE. YOU SHOULD REALLY TALK TO THOSE MOTHER (BEEP). LET'S BEGIN IN THE REALM OF POLITICS. YOU REMEMBER ALL THE WAY BACK HAD JANUARY JOHN McCAIN WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PROMINENT  REPUBLICANS TO BOARD THE MITT PRIVATE PLANE WITH A FULL THROATED ENDORSEMENT.
I AM CONFIDENT WITH THE LEADERSHIP AND THE BACKING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PRESIDENT  OBAMA WILL TURN THIS COUNTRY AROUND. WE BELIEVE IN AMERICA. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US. EXCUSE ME. PRESIDENT ROMNEY. PRESIDENT ROMNEY. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHAT DID I SAY? ROMNEY. I'M TIRED. ANYWAY, JOHN McCAIN'S SEEMINGLY INNOCENT SLIP-UP SET THE STAGE FOR A SERIES OF  ROMNEY ENDORSEMENTS WHERE HIGH PROFILE REPUBLICANS CANNOT BACK THE FORMER MASSACHUSETTS  GOVERNORS WITHOUT THEIR TONGUES TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR HEADS. THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S ENDLESS SUFFRAGE 2012. ROMNEY WILL BE THE NOMINEE. EVERYBODY HAS DECIDED. THEY'RE ALL GETTING BEHIND HIM. WHAT THEY HAVEN'T REALLY DECIDED IS WHY. LAST WEEK BROUGHT A STRING OF HIGH PROFILE ENDORSEMENTS FOR ROMNEY PERHAPS NONE HIGHER  THAN THIS ONE. THAT'S RIGHT. HEFNER ENDORSED ROMNEY FOR PRESIDENT. THAT IS ACTUALLY FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH. LOOK AT THIS PHOTO OP. MITT ROMNEY AND AN ALMOST 90-YEAR-OLD GUY IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE FORMAL YACHT WEAR. LOOK AT THE PICTURE. WHO IN IT LOOKS LIKE THE MORE RELATEABLE GUY TO HANG OUT WITH? IT AIN'T ROMNEY. ROMNEY IS SO BLAND IN THIS PICTURE HE MAKES BUSH ALMOST LIKE ETHNIC. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET TO THE ENDORSEMENT.
BARBARA AND I ARE VERY PROUD TO FULLY AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENDORSE AND  SUPPORT OUR OLD FRIEND MITT ROMNEY. HE'S A GOOD MAN. HE'LL MAKE A GREAT PRESIDENT. AND WE JUST WISH HIM WELL.
Jon: WE DO WISH HE'D STOP SITTING THERE STARING AT US. SERIOUSLY DOES MITT ROMNEY REALLY NEED TO BE STARING AT THEM? IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S HOLDING THEM HOSTAGE IN SOME WAY. GEORGE, BLINK TWICE IF YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING TO ENDORSE SANTORUM. REPUBLICAN AFTER REPUBLICAN HAVE BEGUN TO LINE UP BEHIND MITT ROMNEY WITH ONE SIMPLE MESSAGE.
THE MORE WE DRAG IT OUT THE HARDER IT IS TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. IT COULD BECOME COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IF IT DRAGS ON MUCH LONGER. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO COALESCE AS CONSERVATIVES AROUND MITT ROMNEY.
Jon: WE HAVE VOTED ENOUGH. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE FIRST STARTED VOTING I THOUGHT IT WAS WORKING OUT FOR US. BUT NOW THE VOTING, I DON'T KNOW. WATCH RISING STAR MARCO RUBIO ATTEMPT TO ENDORSE ROMNEY WITHOUT TASTING JUST A LITTLE  BIT OF VOMIT IN THE BACK OF HIS THROAT.
I AM GOING TO ENDORSE MITT ROMNEY. THE REASON IS NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE BUT HE  OFFERS SUCH A STARK CONTRAST TO THE PRESIDENT'S RECORD.
Jim: I'M GOING TO ENDORSE ROMNEY BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO  BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. THAT'S LIKE I'M GOING TO ENDORSE MITT ROMNEY BECAUSE, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? AND THEN HE SAID AT THIS POINT, HE'S A GOOD CONTRAST. AT THIS POINT. THIS VERSION OF ROMNEY WILL BE A GOOD CONTRAST TO THE PRESIDENT. I'M NOT SAYING EVERY ENDORSEMENT HAS TO BE AT THE TED KENNEDY FOR THE BARACK OBAMA LEVEL.
I'M PROUD TO STAND WITH HIM HERE TODAY AND OFFER MY HELP, OFFER MY VOICE, OFFER MY ENERGY, MY COMMITMENT TO MAKE BARACK OBAMA THE NEXT  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WOOO! BUT AN ENDORSEMENT SHOULD AT LEAST MEET THE GEORGE KENNEDY FOR BETTER BREATH STANDARD.
I SWALLOW A FEW POWERFUL CAPSULES AND I HAVE CLEANER BREATH FOR HOURS AND HOURS. BREATH-ASSURED.
Jon: THAT'S AN ENDORSEMENT. HE'S NOT SAYING TAKE BREATH ASSURE BECAUSE, WELL, WE JUST CAN'T KEEP STANDING HERE  LOOKING AT CERTS AND TRY DENT AND THE TRUTH IS BREATH ASSURE IS BETTER THAN BAD BREATH I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW. ALL RIGHT. A LOT OF TEPID ENDORSEMENTS BUT THESE ARE MOSTLY TEA PARTY TYPES THAT ARE GIVING THESE. LET'S HEAR FROM FELLOW NORTH EASTERN DULL EX-GOVERNORS.
I AM ENDORSING HIM. MITT IS NOT A PERFECT CANDIDATE. HE HAS A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS.
Jon: WHICH ARE VERY MUCH OVERSHADOWED BY HIS GOOD QUALITIES WHICH ARE....
IT'S HARD FOR HIM, FOR BLUE- COLLAR FAMILIES LIKE MINE TO IDENTIFY WITH HIM. IT'S HARD WITH ECONOMIC CONSERVATIVES TO IDENTIFY WITH HIM.
Jon: HE'S GOOD WITH LATINOS.
HE NEEDS TO DO MORE TO REACH OUT TO THE LATINOS.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THESE ARE HIS SUPPORTERS. FOR GOD'S SAKES, THIS IS PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS. FAKE IT BETTER. JUST IMAGINE IF PAST CAMPAIGNS HAD FAILED THIS TEST OF SINCERITY. I LIKE IKE WOULD HAVE BEEN "IKE'S FINE." REAGAN'S OPTIMISTIC MORNING IN  AMERICA WOULD BE "IT'S TIME TO GET UP." A PROPOSAL ON A FOOTBALL  SCOREBOARD READING, "LOOK, DEBRA WE BOTH KNOW WE'RE NOT EACH OTHER'S FIRST CHOICES BUT I DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR  ANOTHER MONTH OF E HARMONY. YOU'RE A WORTHY COMPANION. SO, COME ON. SETTLE FOR ME." CAN ANYBODY... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ... ANYBODY OUT THERE OFFER A  STRONG UNEQUIVOCAL ENDORSEMENT OF MITT ROMNEY? MITT ROMNEY'S WIFE.
SOMETIMES HE APPEARS STIFF. DO YOU HAVE TO FIGHT BACK LIKE MY HUSBAND ISN'T STIFF?
WELL, YOU KNOW, I GUESS WE BETTER UNZIP HIM AND LET THE REAL MITT ROMNEY OUT BECAUSE  HE IS NOT....
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
