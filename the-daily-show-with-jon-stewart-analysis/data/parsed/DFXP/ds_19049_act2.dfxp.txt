Jon: WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM THE BIGGEST SPORTING EVENT OF THE YEAR, SUPER BOWL XLVIII. UNFORTUNATELY PAST SUPER BOWLS HAVE BEEN PLAGUED BY SHORTAGES OF NECESSARY SUPER BOWLING MATERIAL.
LOOKING HEAD TO THE SUPER BOWL THERE ARE RUMORS --
AH.
OF A CHICKEN WING SHORTAGE.
DALLAS AND SURROUNDING AREAS HAVE SOME SORT OF A STRIPPER SHORTAGE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: NOT FUNNY. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE THIS YEAR THE MATCHUP IS BETWEEN THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS AND THE DENVER BRONCOS TWO TEAMS HAILING FROM STATES THAT HAVE BOTH LEGALIZED MARIJUANA THAT MAKES THIS YEAR'S SHORTAGE ALL THE MORE TRAGIC.
A VELVEETA SHORTAGE RAISING BIG CONCERNS AHEAD OF SUPER BOWL.
WARNING ABOUT A VELVEETA SHORTAGE WHICH MEANS CHEESE LOVERS WILL BE WATCHING NFL PLAYOFFS WITH JUST PLAIN CHEESE.
Jon: NOOOOOOOOO! NO VELVEETA, WHAT WILL I DO WITHOUT MY MILK BASED SODIUM PHOSPHATE? I'LL HAVE NOTHING TO DO DIP MY CALCIUM HYDROXIDE INTO. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO DIG INTO MY STRATEGIC VELVEETA RESERVE, MOUNT CHEESEMORE. I LIKE TO START WITH ROOSEVELT AND WORK MY WAY UP TO LINCOLN. ALL RIGHT? SOMETHING ABOUT THIS VELVEETA SHORTAGE FEELS A LITTLE -- WHAT IS THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR (bleep).
VELVEETA REP SAID DEMAND IS HIGH DURING THE PLAYOFFS BUT WOULD NOT GIVE A SPECIFIC REASON FOR THE LACK OF AVAILABILITY.
I'VE BEEN IN A DOZEN STORES TODAY AND ONLY ONE I HAVE FOUND NO VELVEETA. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HERE IS MY IMPRESSION OF HIM IN THOSE STORES. I WENT TO COLUMBIA JOURNALISM SCHOOL. YES I CAN DO THIS. WAIT A MINUTE, I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT THIS ISN'T REAL. ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT THE MAKERS OF VELVEETA WOULD ATTEMPT TO PASS OFF AS REAL SOME SORT OF BLATANTLY ARTIFICIAL CLEARLY UNNATURAL SYNTHETIC CREATION? YOU, SIR, CLEARLY DON'T KNOW VELVEETA. MAYBE OUR PRECIOUS CHEESE LIKE SUBSTANCE IS SAFE BUT FOOTBALL FANS SHOULDN'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE BECAUSE A REAL AND MORE DEVASTATING SHORTAGE IS ON THE HORIZON. A FAST SPREADING PIG VIRUS IS ABOUT TO CAUSE BACON PRICES TO SKY ROCKET.
Jon: I THINK YOU ARE BURYING THE LEAD HERE. ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT BACON PRICES GOING UP OR I BELIEVE THE PHRASE YOU USED WAS A FAST SPREADING VIRUS. UNDERSTANDABLY HIGHER BACON PRICES COULD BE A SIDE EFFECT OF AN EPIDEMIC LIKE THAT BUT SO COULD AMPLE PARKING. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS FAST SPREADING VIRUS. SPRE
THE PORCINE EPIDEMIC DIARRHEA VIRUS, ALSO KNOWN  AS PED, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN 200 HOG FACILITIES.
Jon: I RETRACT MY REQUEST. COULD YOU BE A LITTLE LESS SPECIFIC. [LAUGHTER] PORCINE DIARRHEA VIRUS. WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] PERHAPS WE SHOULD GO BACK TO WHAT THIS IS DOING TO OUR BACON STOCKPILE.
HERE GOES YOUR BACON CHEESEBURGER, YOUR PIGS IN A BLANKET AND YOUR COBB SALAD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU KNOW PIGS IN A BLANKET ARE NOT ACTUAL PIGS, RIGHT. YOU HEAR A STORY ABOUT A BACON SHORTAGE AND YOU GO WITH NO MORE SALADS OR BAR MITZVAH FOOD THAT DOESN'T CONTAIN PORK. WHOSE PIG LUXURY PENTHOUSE DID YOU SHOOT YOUR FOOTAGE IN. BECAUSE FROM WHAT I RECALL THERE'S A LITTLE LESS ELBOW ROOM AND MORE EXCREMENT. IT'S (bleep) BACON. LOOK AT IT. THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE IT. IT'S NOT SOME PIG IN A GIANT LOFT. [ LAUGHTER PLAYING SHUFFLEBOARD AND INVITING OVER A SPIDER THAT WRITES MESSAGES. [LAUGHTER] NOW MAYBE A BACON SHORTAGE ISN'T SUCH A BAD THING SEEING AS AMERICA GETS LESS OF A THING THAT'S KILLING US. A BACON SHORTAGE WHICH MEANS TYPE TWO DIABETES RATES COULD FALL DRAMATICALLY EXTENDING OUR LIVES AND SAVING US BILLIONS IN HEALTH CARE. WHY GOD? WHY? IF THERE'S ONE RISK WE'RE RUNNING, IT'S NOT EATING TOO LITTLE BACON.
MORE BACON THE BETTER.
BACON MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER.
GOTTA BE BACON ONLY ONE THING SMELLS LIKE BACON IT'S BACON.
Jon: SLOW DOWN, EVERYBODY WITH THE BACON. ARE WE ALREADY FORGETTING SOMETHING?
I HAVE VIRAL DIARRHEA.
Jon: THAT WILL DO, PIG. THAT WILL DO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
