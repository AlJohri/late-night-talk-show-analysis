Jon: WELCOME BACK. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, PEOPLE. THERE IS ONE OPEN MARRIAGE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WILL NEVER GO SOUTH. AMERICA'S OPEN MARRIAGE WITH THE FREE MARKET. THAT'S THE WORST SEGUE EVER. (LAUGHTER) JASON JONES HAS THIS REPORT.
Reporter: THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE'S ONE THING SYSTEMICALLY DESTROYING THE  BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY.
THE REGULATIONS ARE WHAT ARE KILLING THE JOB CREATION IN THIS COUNTRY.
REGULATION IS CRUSHING AMERICAN BUSINESS.
AND NOW ACCORDING TO SMALL BUSINESSMAN LOU FERANTA ONE OF THE NATION'S  PROUDEST FAMILY-RUN ORGANIZATIONS IS FEELING THE SQUEEZE OF OVERREGULATION.
THE MAFIA IS THE LONGEST RUNNING FAMILY BUSINESS IN THIS COUNTRY. WITH ALL THE REGULATIONS  [BLEEP]ED EVERYTHING UP, THEY'RE DESTROYING THE MAFIA.
THAT'S SAD.
IT IS [BLEEP] SAD, THE RICO LAWS ARE KILLING THE BUSINESS OF THE MAFIA.
YES, CAPITALISM IS BEING STRANGLED THANKS TO THE RICO ACT WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO  PROSECUTE AN ENTIRE ORGANIZATION BASED ON THE CRIMINAL ACTION OF A FEW MEMBERS. IT ALSO PUT FERANTA BEHIND BARS FOR EIGHT YEARS.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WHEN ADAM SMITH WROTE WEALTH OF NATIONS, HE HAD THE MAFIA IN MIND. LACE AYE [BLEEP] FAIRE.
AMAZINGLY BUREAUCRATS LIKE FORMER MOB PROSECUTOR WANT TO STAND IN THE WAY OF  LASISSEZ [BLEEP] FAIRE ECONOMIC.
IT IS A PER VERSION OF CAPITALISM BECAUSE IT INVOLVES BID-RIGGING, CORRUPTION, BRIBERY, EXTORTION.
THE MAFIA IS SUPPLY AND DEMAND. THEY NEED MORE SUPPLY. THEY DEMAND IT, YOU GIVE IT TO THEM.
COME ON-- THE MOB DEMANDS TRIBUTE. AND IF YOU DON'T PAY THE MOB TAX YOU GET YOUR LEGS BROKEN.
Reporter: THAT IS A MISUNDERSTANDING OF A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MODEL  WALL STREET CAN LEARN FROM.
WHEN THE RECESSION HIT, MAFIA WASN'T LOOKING FOR BAILOUT MONEY.
Reporter: YOU DIDN'T PAY YOUR BETS, YOU GOT A BASEBALL BAT IN THE FACE.
AT THE WORST.
THE MOB IS WEAKER TODAY BECAUSE OF RICO AND THAT'S A GOOD THING.
I SEE YOU'RE WEARING A WIRE. YOU HEAR ME YOU [BLEEP] PITION, HUH? YOU AIN'T GOT [BLEEP] ON ME.
YOUR STAFF GAVE ME THIS MICROPHONE.
SO THEY DID. YOU WERE SAYING RICO LAW, THEIR EFFECTIVENESS, CONTINUE.
IN ESSENCE, THE SUCCESS OF RICO HAS CAUSED LESS ENTHUSIASM FOR THE MOB LIFESTYLE.
ENTHUSIASM, ENTHUSIASM, WHAT'S MY ENTHUSIASM? BAD HIT EN, FREEST FORM-- BADMINTON, FREEST FORM OF COMPETITION THERE IS.
IS THERE A POINT?
MAKE UG NERVOUS?
NOT REALLY.
NO MATTER WHAT I TRIED, REGULATORS REFUSED TO BACK OFF. FORTUNATELY THERE WERE PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR THE FREE MARKET LIKE ECONOMIST JOHN  DUNNHAM WHO AGREED TO MEET ME FAR AWAY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S WATCHFUL  EYEWITNESSES YOU DUNHAM?
YEAH, I'M DUNHAM.
YOU KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT REGULATIONS, CORRECT?
YEAH, I DO, I HAVE BEEN AN ECONOMIST FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS. AND I'VE DONE A LOT TO FIGHT AGAINST OVERREGULATION IN AMERICAN BUSINESS.
WHY ARE WE MEETING IN A PARKING LOT.
I'LL ASK THE QUESTIONS, TOUGH GUY.
OKAY.
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO THESE BA-FONGOOS DOWN IN WASHINGTON.
I THINK THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO TO KEEP THE BAFONGOOS IN WASHINGTON TO OVERREGULATE. VOTE AGAINST THEM.
SO PONY UP SOME CASH AND BUY SOME VOTES, IS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT. WE NEED TO SEND A MESSAGE, STRONG MESSAGE-- MESSAGE.
SEND THEM A MESSAGE LIKE BROKEN THUMBS, HORSES HEAD, WHAT.
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MAVIA. I'M TALKING ABOUT LEGITIMATE BUSINESS --
WHOA, WHOA WHO IS TALKING ABOUT THAT.
IF YOU ARE SPEAKING ABOUT CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES THEN I THINK THERE IS A DEFINITE  NEED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO USE LAW ENFORCEMENT METHODS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T PROSPER.
I THINK WE SHOULD GO FISHING.
EVEN THE FREE MARKETEERS WERE SELLING OUT AND AS WE ALL KNOW THERE IS ON ONE WAY  TO DEAL WITH RATS.
ARE YOU SHOOTING AT FISH?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ANTI-REGULATION, WHAT DOW CARE.
BUT MAYBE THE WORST THING ABOUT THESE REGULATIONS IS THE HARM THEY'RE DOING TO  THE STORIED STRUCTURE OF THIS PROUD AMERICAN INDUSTRY.
BECAUSE OF THESE RICO LAWS, SOME GUYS ARE ACTUALLY REFUSING TO BE MADE.
THEY'RE TURNING DOWN OFFERS TO GET MADE.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. GUYS REFUSING THE BIGGEST HONOR IN THE MAFIA. IT'S [BLEEP], YEAH, YOU DON'T HAVE A JOKE, THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT FUNNY. (APPLAUSE)
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
[BLEEP] YOU ASKING ME FOR, WHAT, DOW WANT ME TO HOLD YOUR [BLEEP]?
LOOKS LIKE IT'S AN OFFER THEY CAN REFUSE.
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
IT WAS A LITTLE FUNNY.
NO, NOT AT ALL.
LITTLE BIT.
AS THE MAFIA STRUGGLES TO OVERCOME THIS STIFLING REGULATION, ONE THING REMAINS CLEAR.
YOU REALLY ARE A [BLEEP] IDIOT.
