Jon: WELCOME BACK. THE DRUG WAR -- TOUGH SEGUE. THE DRUG WAR HAS COST COUNTLESS  LITCHS AND ENDLESS DOLLARS. NOW THERE'S A TERRIFYING FRONT  FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE. JASON HAS MORE.
EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT THE DRUG  VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY THE  RUTHLESS MEXICAN CARTELS BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT THE  VIOLENT ONES UP NORTH IN QUEBEC. I SAT DOWN WITH A LOCAL REPORTER  WHO AGREED TO SPEAK WITH US ON  THE CONDITION WE HID HIS  IDENTITY. THIS SAY BIG DEAL IN CANADA. THE CARTEL ACCOUNTS FOR THREE  QUARTERS OF PRODUCTION.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT  HERE? COKE, HEROIN, MARIJUANA.
MAPLE SYRUP.
COME AGAIN.
MAPLE SYRUP.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE SAYING  MAPLE SYRUP.
YES, THE CONDIMENT.
PUT THE LIGHTS ON. WHAT?
A BARREL OF MAPLE SYRUP THE  MARKET VALUE IS 20 TIMES THAT OF  A BARREL OF CRUDE OIL.
HOLY (bleep), TURN THE  LIGHTS OUT. THIS LUCRATIVE BUSINESS IS  CONTROLLED BY THE CARTEL KNOWN  AS THE CONFEDERATION OF MAPLE SYRUP PRODUCERS. I ARRANGED THE MEETING WITH THE  BOSSMAN HIMSELF THE PABLO  ESCOBAR OF MAPLE SYRUP.
WHEN IT -- HI, WELCOME TO  CANADA.
NOT THE GREETING HE WAS  EXPECTING.
SOME PEOPLE SAID WE'RE KIND  OF OPEC OF MAPLE SYRUP. WE HAVE 42 MILLION POUNDS IN THE  RESERVE IN THE WAREHOUSES.
DID YOU JUST SAY YOU HAVE A  STRATEGIC MAPLE SYRUP RESERVE?
YES.
DO YOU FEEL THE WORD WOULD  COLLAPSE IF THE SYRUP STOPPED  FLOWING?
YES, BECAUSE YOU KNOW MAPLE  SYRUP IS A COMFORT FOOD  BASICALLY.
WHERE THE SYRUP FLOWS, CRIME  FOLLOWS.
18 MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF  MAPLE SYRUP WAS STOLEN FROM A  STORAGE WAREHOUSE.
POLICE RECOVERED VEHICLES,  ELECTRONIC LIFTS AND SCALES AND  THEY SEIZED A WAREHOUSE.
YES, SYRUP RELATED CRIME IS  EXPLODED AGAINST CANADA WITH  CRIMINALS BECOMING MORE BRAZEN EVERY DAY.
IT WAS APPARENTLY SIPHONED  FROM THE ORIGINAL CONTAINERS AND  DISTRIBUTED THROUGH UNDERGROUND CHANNELS AND ULTIMATELY ACROSS  THE BORDER. THAT'S A LOT OF MAPLE SYRUP TO  SHOVE UP YOUR ASS.
YOU WOULDN'T DO IT. WOULD YOU DRIVE IT.
OF COURSE, THAT MAKES SENSE. HE WASN'T GOING TO GET IT GO  UNPUNNISHED.
I THOUGHT THIS SAY JOKE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
DO YOU THINK SENDING A  MESSAGE BY STRINGING A THIEF UP  BY A MAPLE TREE?
NO. CLEARLY I WOULD GET NOWHERE WITH  THIS MASTER OF LIES. IF I WAS GOING TO FIND THE  MISSING STICKY I HAD TO STEP OUT  OF MY COMFORT ZONE TO UNDERGROUND SYRUP HOUSES.
DO YOU HAVE IDEA OF WAR GOING  ON TO PUT THIS (bleep) IN  FRONT OF YOUR FACE.
IT'S WAFFLES.
THIS WAS THE BIGGEST SYRUP  HEIST IN CANADIAN HISTORY BUT  ALL THE SAP SUCKERS CARED ABOUT WAS GETTING THE NEXT FIX.
IT'S REALLY GOOD ON ICE  CREAM. IT GETS KIND OF THICK AND MORE  SYRUPY LIKE TOFFEE.
I'M LOOKING AT WHAT YOU ARE  EATING AND THINKING YOU ARE  BARELY HUMAN ANYMORE.
EXCUSE ME?
WHEN INVESTIGATING THE  UNDERWORLD OF SYRUP TRADE A  REPORTER HAS TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET TOO CLOSE.
HAVE YOU TRIED?
I DON'T NEED TO.
Tom: YES, YOU SHOULD TRY.
I DON'T NEED TO, OKAY?
BUT SAYING CLEAN IN CANADA  ISN'T EASY WITH PUSHERS  EVERYWHERE.
DID YOU EVEN TRY IT?
I DON'T NEED TO TRY IT.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT. YOU WILL TRY IT BECAUSE IT'S FOR  YOU TO BE ABLE TO TALK ON TV  ABOUT MAPLE SYRUP, YOU HAVE TO TASTE IT.
FINE. SURE, IT WAS GOOD, EVEN GREAT  BUT THIS WAS A SERIOUS STORY  THAT SOMEONE NEEDED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF AND I WAS NOT  ABOUT TO LOSE CONTROL. [ LAUGHTER ] HAPPEN TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT  THESE STOLEN CANADIAN STICKIES?
NO.
DO YOU HAVE SAMPLES?
WANT TO TASTE IT.
LOOK AT THAT. JUST A LITTLE. I'LL TAKE THREE JUGS.
THREE JUGS, ALL RIGHT.
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING BIGGER  THAN THESE?
I WAS GETTING ANSWERS BUT I  NEEDED MORE ANSWERS, A LOT MORE  ANSWERS. ♪ IT'S JUST A SHOUT AWAY ♪  ♪ ♪
PUT THE SYRUP IN THE BAG. PUT THE SYRUP IN THE BAG ♪  ♪ ♪
IN QUEBEC POLICE SAY THEY'VE  ARRESTED 18 PEOPLE IN CONNECTION  WITH THE THEFT OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF MAPLE SYRUP.
MOTHER (bleep) THEY SOLVED  THIS THING?
WHY I HAD LET MYSELF BECOME  ADDICTED TO MAPLE SYRUP. THIS THING WAS OVER OR WAS IT?
WE'RE WORKING ON DEVELOPING  NEW MARKETS TALKING ABOUT JAPAN  AND EUROPE. THERE'S A LOT OF CONSUMERS  THERE.
HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?
YOU PUT MAPLE SYRUP IN YOUR  TEA OR COFFEE. YOU ARE GOING TO BE SLEEP LIKE A  BABY. [LAUGHTER] >>
