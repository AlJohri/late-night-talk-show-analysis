[ Cheering and Applause ]
Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, A TEXAS STATE SENATOR AND DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE FOR TEXAS, HER NEW MEMOIR IS CALLED "FORGETTING TO BE AFRAID." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, STATE SENATOR WENDY DAVIS. [ Cheering and Applause ] HOW ARE YOU? [ Cheering and Applause ] HOW ARE YOU? THERE WE GO. FORGETTING TO BE AFRAID. ALL RIGHT. THERE WE GO. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU. Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED, ALTHOUGH WOULD YOU PREFER TO STAND -- I KNOW YOU LIKE TO STAND.
I'M FINE. I'M FINE. THANK YOU. Jon: HOW LONG WAS YOUR -- YOU ROSE TO PROMINENCE OBVIOUSLY ON A NATIONAL LEVEL WITH A FILIBUSTER, 13 HOURS? 14 HOURS?
IT WAS JUST UNDER 13 HOURS. Jon: 13 HOURS AGAINST SOME CHOICE LEGISLATION, ANTI-CHOICE LEGISLATION WAS GOING ON IN THE TEXAS STATE CONGRESS.
THAT'S RIGHT. IN OUR TEXAS SENATE.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT PASSED UNFORTUNATELY IN A SPECIAL SESSION, AND IT RESULTED IN EXACTLY WHAT WE FEARED. ALMOST ALL OF THE WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTERS THAT PROVIDED THAT CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED MEDICAL CARE CLOSED.
Jon: AND THERE'S NO WAY TO GAIN THAT BACK? CAN AUSTIN DO SORT OF A PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOOD TRUCK THING FOR EVERYBODY? GET A TACO AND A PAP SMEAR. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN DO IT. BUT THEY CAN DO SOMETHING.
WELL FORTUNATELY THE SUPREME COURT STEPPED IN, THEY HALTED SOME OF THOSE CLOSURES, SO WE HAVE HAD SOME REOPEN AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE FIGHT.
Jon: THE SUPREME COURT STEPS IN A LOT AROUND HERE. YOU KNOW, THE VOTER I.D. LAW THAT WAS -- THEY PASSED A VOTER I.D. LAW, THE FEDERAL COURTS I GUESS FOUND IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND THE SUPREME COURT SAID, WELL YEAH, BUT THEIR SO USED TO IT NOW. AND THEY DID NOT PUT A STAY ON THAT OR THE ELECTION. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT I THINK 650,000 TO 700,000 TEXANS COULD BE DISENFRANCHISED.
THAT'S CORRECT. MY -- THAT'S CORRECT. MY OPPONENT, GREG ABBOTT WHO IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, IS DEFENDING -- [ AUDIENCE REACTS ]
Jon: THEY'RE THOUGHT BOOING THEIR SAYING ABBOOOTT. ABBOOOTT.
HE IS DEFENDING WHAT IS OF COURSE INTENDED TO SUPPRESS VOTE.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THE DISTRICT COURT AFTER HEARING A FULL TRIAL ON THIS ISSUE FOUND THAT IT WAS THE MODERN DAY VERSION OF A POLL TAX, WHICH IT IS. BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE UNDERLYING DOCUMENTATION TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT PHOTO I.D. AND BE ABLE TO VOTE.
Jon: WELL ISN'T THERE SOMETHING -- A COLLEGE I.D. IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, BUT A GUN PERMIT IS, YES?
CORRECT. WELCOME TO TEXAS.
Jon: OH, YOU'RE WELCOME. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. NOW SO, IN THAT SCENARIO FOR ME, THOUGH, IT SURPRISED ME YOU'RE HAVING A TOUGH CAMPAIGN. RIGHT NOW YOU GUYS ARE DOWN A LITTLE BIT. IS IT,  IN THE REST OF THE STATE, SO YOU SAY THAT HERE AND IN AUSTIN AND EVERYBODY GOES, OOH BOO, BUT IN THE REST OF THE STATE THEY GO, YAY. FOR VOTER I.D. HOW CONSERVATIVE A PLACE IS TEXAS AND WHAT IS THE DEMOGRAPHIC? YOU KNOW, WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT'S FLIPPIN' BLUE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT AIN'T EVEN FLIPPIN' LIKE A COOL AZURE. LIKE IT'S NOT EVEN -- WHAT'S GOING ON?
IT'S ON ITS WAY. IT REALLY IS ON ITS WAY. AND WHAT WE HAVE SUFFERED FROM HERE FOR QUITE AWHILE IS TWO DECADES OF REPUBLICAN LED REDISTRICTING THAT HAVE CREATED VERY PURELY DRAWN REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS AND A FEW VERY PURELY DRAWN DEMOCRATIC ONES. AND SO ALL OF THE CONVERSATIONS IN ELECTIONS TAKE PLACE DURING PRIMARIES. AND IT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS I WAS SO COMMITTED TO THIS RACE. MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE GOING TO FORCE IN TO A GENERAL ELECTION A REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER TO PEOPLE AND INVITE TEXANS TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS REPUBLICAN-LED LEGISLATURE TRULY IS REFLECTIVE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY CARE ABOUT LIKE MAKING SURE THAT THEIR SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED AFTER THEY WATCH $5.5 BILLION BEING CUT.
Jon: WHAT DO THEY DO -- FIVE AND HALF BILLION. I'LL TELL YOU, I WAS SHOCKED WHEN THEY SAID THEY WERE TRYING TO CUT $5.5 BILLION FROM EDUCATION IN TEXAS I HAD NO IDEA YOU SPENT ANYWHERE NEAR THAT.  [Laughter] WILL YOU STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT?
ABSOLUTLEY.
Jon: WE'RE GOING TO THROW TO -- WE'LL THROW A LITTLE BIT MORE UP ON THE WEB THERE. "FORGETTING TO BE AFRAID," WHICH IS PROBABLY WON'T BE THE TITLE OF MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY. [ Laughter ] IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. STATE SENATOR WENDY DAVIS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
