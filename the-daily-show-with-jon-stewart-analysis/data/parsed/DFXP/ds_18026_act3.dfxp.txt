( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  MY GUEST TONIGHT,  HE IS THE SENIOR JUDICIAL  ANALYST FOR THE FOX NEWS  CHANNEL. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THEODORE  AND WOODROW."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK, THE GOOD  JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO. WHAT'S UP?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Jon:  IT'S THE JUDGE! HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
I AM WELL.
Jon:  WE'RE GOING TO GET  INTO THINGS, THEODORE AND  WOODROW, BUT FIRST--
THIS IS A GREAT AUDIENCE.
Jon:  THEY'RE A LOVELY  GROUP OF PEOPLE. THEY'RE HERE-- THE TICKETS ARE  FREE.
THEY DIDN'T PAY TO GET IN?
Jon:  THEY DID NOT PAY TO  GET IN. THEY LOVE YOU. LET ME ASK YOU TWO THINGS  FIRST--
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE ME  DEFEND O'REILLY?
Jon:  WHY, OF COURSE--  COULD YOU?   ( LAUGHTER )   I WOULD LIKE TO--    ( APPLAUSE )
HE'S MY BUDDY.
Jon:  ISN'T THERE A  PREVAILING ATTITUDE THAT I'M  NOTICING OVER THERE THAT SOMEHOW WE'VE REACHED A TIPPING POINT,  THAT THERE IS A NEW DEMOGRAPHIC  CHANGE IN AMERICA THAT IS UNLIKE THE OTHERS. YOU MENTIONED IT ON THE MORNING  SHOW THAT YOU THOUGHT O'REILLY  WAS RIGHT THAT WE ARE NOW A NATION OF TAKERS. YOU KNOW THAT IF THAT ATTITUDE  HAD PREVAILED, YOU AND I,  MR. O'REILLY, IF IT HAD PREVAILED IN AMERICA'S HISTORY,  YOU AND I WOULD NOT BE HERE.
I KNOW IF THE GOVERNMENT HAD  NOT ALLOWED NEWCOMBERS TO COME  TO THE COUNTRY AND FLOURISH, YOU AND I AND A LOT OF GOOD FOLKS IN  THE STUDIO WOULDN'T BE HERE. THAT'S WHY I'M IN FAVOR OF OPEN  BORDERS. I THINK YOU HAVE NATURAL  RIGHTS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOUR  MOTHER WAS WHEN YOU WERE BORN. YOU CAN GO WHERE YOU WANT AND  LIVE WHERE YOU GO AND IT'S NONE  OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BUSINESS WHERE YOU WERE BORN.
Jon:  I THINK THAT'S  EXCELLENT. BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THERE IS  THIS FEAR, THOUGH, THAT SOMEHOW  THERE'S-- I'M GETTING THE SENSE THAT THE RIGHT FEELS SUDDENLY  OUT-NUMBERED? AND I THINK IT'S A FANTASY, A  PARANOID FANTASY.
REMEMBER I'M NOT OF THE  RIGHT. I'M THE LIBERTARIAN, THE RON  PAUL GUY OVER THERE.   ( APPLAUSE ).
GOD BLESS YOU.
Jon:  THE PEOPLE OF THE  POT.
AND HUMAN FREEDOMS. THE RIGHT, OBVIOUSLY, IS  OUT-NUMBERED BECAUSE THE  ELECTION, THE LAST TWO ELECTIONS HAVE TOLD US SO. BUT THE RIGHT SHOULDN'T BE. IT REALLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO  APPEAL TO A VAST ARRAY OF PEOPLE  WHO WANT THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THEIR BANK BOOKS AND OUT OF  THEIR VICTIMS AND LEAVE THEM  ALONE.
Jon:  IN SOME RESPECTS,  THOUGH, HASN'T IT SHOWN PEOPLE  DO WANT AN EFFECTIVE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR SOME THINGS? FOR INSTANCE, MY PARENTS -- MY  MOTHER IS FROM THE BRONX, MY  FATHER IS FROM BROOKLYN.
MY GRANDMOTHER IS FROM THE  BRONX.
Jon:  OH, MY GOD, ARE WE  RELATED?
HOW COULD THAT POSSIBLY BE? GIVE ME THAT HAND.
Jon:  ABSOLUTE! THIS AND THEN THIS.
RIGHT!
Jon:  THEY GREW UP POOR. CITY UNIVERSITY AT THAT TIME WAS  FREE. THEY GOT AN EXCELLENT, FREE  EDUCATION. NOW,-- FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
FROM A LOCAL CITY AND STATE  GOVERNMENT. NOT FROM THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT. YOU SEE, THERE'S THIS THING  CALLED THE CONSTITUTION. THAT'S WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK  BECAUSE THESE TWO CHARACTERS  EVE THATELIEVE IN BELI THE CONSTITUTION MEANT WHAT IT  SAID. THE CONSTITUTION LIMITS THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND LETS THE  STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THINGS. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY FAIR  CITY COLLEGE IN YOUR TAXES, GO  TO ANOTHER STATE WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THESE COLUMNS. IF YOU WANT TO LIVE WHERE PEOPLE  CAN GET A GOOD EDUCATION, PEOPLE  WHO OTHERWISE COULDN'T AFFORD IT, GO LIVE WHERE THE TAXES PAY  FOR THOSE SCHOOLS. AS RONALD REAGAN SAID PEOPLE CAN  VOTE WITH THEIR FEET.
Jon:  ULTIMATE THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT-- POOR  PEOPLE, OBVIOUSLY THEIR SUZ, THE SOLES ARE NOT AS QUICK, HAVE  TROUBLE TROUBLE WITH MOBILITY IN  SOME SPARSE. YOU'RE SAYING THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE  INVOLVED IN EDUCATION AT ALL.
NO, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  SHOULD NOT BE INVOLVED IN  EDUCATION.
Jon:  AT ALL.
OR THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE  AMENDED TO REFLECT THE CONSENSUS  THAT IT SHOULD. BUT WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  EXCEEDS THE CONSTITUTION AND  IT'S THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND, HOW CAN WE TRUST THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO  ANYTHING? THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT  EVEN SPY ON THE COUNTRY TEA  CHIEF SPY BECAUSE THEY THINK HE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR, EVEN  THOUGH THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW  THEY'VE SWORN TO UPHOLD.
Jon:  IF YOUR ARGUMENT IS  WE CAN'T TRUST THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT TO DO ANYTHING HOW CAN WE TRUST IT TO DO ANYTHING,  LIKE FIGHT WARS OR WHAT IT SAYS  IN CONSTITUTION TO DO.
THE CONSTITUTION WAS CREATED  TO GIVE US CHECKS AND BALANCES. THE STATES WERE A CHECK ON THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT  TO HEAR THIS. IF THEY DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THE  FEDS WERE DOING, THEY COULD  LEAVE, AND THE FED WOULD LOSE A LOT OF INCOME BUT THE THREAT OF  LEAVING WOULD CAUSE THE FEDS TO  BEHAVE.
Jon:  ISN'T THAT-- I  THOUGHT THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE  CONSTITUTION WAS THEY TRIED WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING, AND OF IN THE  ARTICLEES OF CONFEDERATION, AND  THEY WENT, OH, THE WHISKEY REBELLION, AND THEN THEY  CONSOLIDATED--
I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE SIDE  OF THE REBELS.  LISTEN, I CANDIDLY SALUTE YOU  FOR THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY  THAT YOU GAVE BECAUSE THE ESTABLISHMENT ALWAYS PEARS THE  NEXT GENERATION.  AND IF THE ESTABLISHMENT  STOPPED THE NEXT GENERATION FROM  COMING IN, YOU AND I WOULDN'T BE  HERE.
Jon:  THAT'S RIGHT. >>THEY PRETEND THE NEXT  GENERATION IS NOT AS VIRTUOUS.
THE COUNTRY IS BIG ENOUGH TO  EXPAND AND ABSORB. ONE OUT OF MANY. THE MANY COME HERE AND FORM A  WONDERFUL MOSAIC --
Stephen:  THERE'S GOT TO BE  A LATIN PHRASE FOR THAT, THAT'S  MORE ELKENT. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING IN  THERE.
E PLURIBUS.
Jon:  WAIT, DONALDY E--  NO, THAT'S NOT IT. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SPYING. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PETRAEUS,  THE GOVERNMENT AND PETRAEUS. YOU ALSO HAVE SOME THEORIES  ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE, AM  I CORRECT?
YES, I DO, YES.
Jon:  WOULD YOU LIKE TO  DISCUSS THEM?
I WOULD. YOU WANT ME TO DISCUSS THEM.
Jon:  I WOULD LIKE TO  DISCUSS THEM. I WILL SAY THIS, THOUGH. WE ARE ON TELEVISION, AND THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD BE  MONITORING THIS CONVERSATION.
I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MONITORS ALL  CONVERSATIONS, EVEN THOSE BETWEEN THE HEAD OF THE C.I.A. AND HIS MISTRESS.  .
Jon:  IF THERE WAS A GUY  HAVING A MISTRESS THAT SHOULD BE  MONITORED, WOULDN'T IT BE OUR TOP STY SPYGUY? ISN'T THAT THE WHOLE IDEA, YOU  DON'T WANT TO BLACKMAIL THE TOP  SPY?
SO MANY PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT  THIS, THERE WAS NOTHING TO  BLACKMAIL. THE F.B.I. KNEW ABOUT THIS FROM  THE TIME THEY DID A BACKGROUND  CHECK ON GENERAL PETRAEUS.
Jon:  THAT'S IN THE  FOIBLE FILE.
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILE --
Stephen:  JUDGE.
HAVING BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A  BACKGROUND CHECK I KNOW WHAT  THEY CAN FIND OUT.
Jon:  WHEN DID YOU GET A  BARQUE GROUND CHECK.
TO GO ON THE BENCH.
Jon:  OH, I THOUGHT IT  WAS FOX.   ( LAUGHTER )   WILL YOU STICK AROUND FOR FIVE  MINUTES. "THEODORE AND WOODROW" IS ON THE  BOOKSHELVES NOW. JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO.   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
