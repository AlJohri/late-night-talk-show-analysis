(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  TONIGHT, ONE OF THE STARS OF  "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE," PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM  JASON SUDEIKIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOUNG MAN!
OH, GOODNESS!
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN!
NICE TO SEE YOU AS WELL. THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK.
Jon: STOP IT. NEW A UNIQUE POSITION IN THIS --  AND I'M NOT SURE I CAN THINK OF  A PERFORMER -- YOU DID ROMNEY ON S.N.L .
YES.
Jon: BUT ALSO BIDEN.
YEAH, YEAH, I WAS GOOD TO GO.
Jon: YOU WIN!
YEAH, IF YOU CONSIDER THAT  WINNING. (LAUGHTER)  PRETENDING TO BE SOMEONE ELSE  FOR A WHOLE YEAR OF YOUR LIFE,  THAT'S A FORM OF WINNING. (LAUGHTER)  I DON'T KNOW. BUT --
Jon: DON'T WE ALL ON SOME  LEVEL?
MASKS THAT WE ALL WEAR. INDEED, SO WELL SAID. YEAH AND THEN THERE IS -- ISN'T  THERE AN ODD CHANCE THAT ROMNEY  COULD HAVE WON AND THEN BIDEN WOULD HAVE CON? IS THERE SOME ELECTION THING  WHERE THEY EACH COULD WIN?
Jon: THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN  IN THE 1800s, I THINK.
OKAY, THAT'S WHAT I'M  REFERRING TO.
Jon: I THINK THEY'RE PAIRED  UP NOW. IT'S OFFICIAL THAT IT WAS  OBAMA/BIDEN. IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN -- PEOPLE  COULDN'T HAVE VOTED FOR BIDEN  AND GET ELECTORAL VOTES THERE. THAT'S WHEN THEY USED TO THROW  IT TO THE HOUSE AND THEN THEY  WOULD KIND OF GO BACK AND FORTH AND ALL THAT.
WELL --
Jon: THE OTHER THING, TOO  -- I DON'T REMEMBER THAT (BLEEP)  FROM SCHOOL.
WELL, THAT'S DISAPPOINTING  BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN  FUN.
Jon: IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A  LOT OF FUN. BUT WHO IS MORE -- I WOULD THINK  BIDE IS A MORE -- BIDEN IS A  MORE FUN PLAY AS A CHARACTER.
YEAH, I MEAN I THINK WE  EVENTUALLY FOUND SOMETHING WITH  ROMNEY, OUR WRITERS, SETH MEYERS WROTE THE ONE FROM THIS LAST  SATURDAY.
Jon: THAT WAS A DAMN GOOD  ONE.
I ENJOYED IT BECAUSE WE GOT  TO SHOW THE HUMANITY OF THESE  PEOPLE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE ONES THAT WE  GOT TO DO WHEN I PLAYED BIDEN  WAS WHEN OBAMA CAME OUT AND SORT OF GOT ALL THE LOVE FOR TALKING  ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE AFTER BIDEN  CAME OUT AND SAID IT FIRST AND THEN I DID IT WITH FERRELL  COMING OUT AS GEORGE BUSH AND  YOU GET TO SEE THE HUMANITYTOR HUMAN SIDE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO  YOU DON'T NORMALLY GET TO SEE  IT.
Jon: THE MORE PETTY  JEALOUSIES THAT OCCUR.
SO TO SEE THE BITTERSWEET  NATURE OF ROMNEY, A GUY LOSING  AND GETTING HANDED TO HIM AND ALL THE CLOWNS, IN MINUTE, JUST  THE MILK AND THE --  (LAUGHTER). BUT THEN DEALING WITH PAUL RYAN,  DEALING WITH TRUMP, ALL THESE  PEOPLE THAT HAD HIS BACK SUPPOSEDLY AND JUST HIM BEING  THERE AND THE ONLY PERSON HE HAD  TO RELY ON THROUGH IT ALL WAS HIS WIFE. I THINK THAT'S NICE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A THOUGHTFUL  WAY TO SORT OF SAY, YOU KNOW,  (BLEEP) OFF. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU LOOK AT -- HE HAS  UNDENIABLY LIKE -- TALK ABOUT A  FAMILY -- PEOPLE SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FAMILY. TALK ABOUT A FAMILY UNIT THAT IS  LARGE, SUCCESSFUL, GOOD LOOKING. YOU WONDER, YOU TURNED AROUND  AND YOU SAW THEM ALL SURROUND  HIM AT HIS CONCESSION SPAOEFPB AND HE'S SO HEARTBROKEN AND THAT  SENSE OF "AT LEAST I STILL HAVE  MY FAMILY."  BUT DO YOU THINK HE LOOKED AT THEM LIKE "ALL RIGHT. WHATEVER."
THIS WILL DO. THIS WILL BE FINE. NO I TRULY THINK THAT THE GUY'S  MORE HUMAN THAN WE GIVE HIM  CREDIT FOR.
Jon: DID HE EVER STOP BY?
I'VE NEVER MET HIM OR JOE  BIDEN. MY FATHER MET JOE BIDEN IN 2008  AND HAD A REALLY FUNNY LINE  WHERE HE SAID TO THE SENATOR AT THAT TIME, YOU KNOW, HEY, YOU DO  THE BEST IMPRESSION OF MY SON  I'VE EVER SEEN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S AWESOME.
AND JOE BIDEN'S LIKE "THAT'S  GREAT! WE'VE GOT TO GET A PICTURE!"
Jon: BIDE THAN HAS WEIRD  ENERGY.
I NEVER MET HIM. I FORGOT HE WASN'T AT THE WHITE  HOUSE WHEN SETH COSPONSORED. THEY CAN'T BE IN THE SAME ROOM  AT THE SAME TIME WHICH I  SOMETIMES THINK THAT'S BECAUSE BIDEN AND BARACK ARE THE SAME  PERSON. (LAUGHTER)  ISN'T THAT WHAT THEY SAY? THEY CAN'T FLY TOGETHER AND  TRAVEL TOGETHER. OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN BE SOME OF  THE SAME ROOMS AT THE SAME TIME.
Jon: THAT WOULD MAKE IT  VERY DIFFICULT. I KNOW THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO  DATE THE SAME LADY.
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. YES. ESKIMO TWINS. THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BE ESKIMO  BROTHERS OR WHATEVER.
Jon: THE THING THAT STRIKES  ME THERE'S AN ENERGY WITH HIM  THAT IT COULD GO INTO -- LIKE HE ALWAYS STRIKES ME AS THE TYPE OF  GUY WHO TRIES TO BANG CHICKS AT  FUNERALS.
BIDEN? REALLY.
Jon: YEAH, HE JUST WALKSES  IN AND HE'S LIKE "HEY, SORRY  ABOUT THAT GUY, WHO'S THE BROAD?"  HE'S GOT LIKE A WEIRD --
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT  TWO HANDER MOVIE YOU AND I ARE  GOING TO DO "FUNERAL CRASHERS"? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT OUR MOVIE? WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT?
Jon: I DON'T WANT TO GIVE  IT AWAY. (APPLAUSE)  AGAIN, CONGRATULATIONS, THOUGH,  ON ANOTHER SEASON OF "SATURDAY  NIGHT LIVE." PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, THAT'S  GRUELING. THAT'S PUTTING ON A BROADWAY  PLAY EVERY WEEK.
YEAH, IT'S REALLY -- THE FACT  THAT THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE  SCENES, OUR HAIR AND MAKEUP, WARDROBE, SET DESIGN PEOPLE  DON'T WIN PERENNIAL EMMIES IS  SHOCKING TO ME BECAUSE WHAT THEY DO IN THREE DAYS -- BECAUSE WE  WRITE IT ON MONDAY AND TONIGHT'S  OUR WRITING NIGHT BUT THEN THEY BUILD THESE THINGS AND CREATE  THESE THINGS AND THESE WORLDS  AND LOOKS AND TWO DAYS -- AND THURSDAY, FRIDAY, AND SATURDAY.
Jon: AND PEOPLE WILL GO  "TAKE IT OUT OF SHERWOOD FOREST,  WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON THE U.S.S. MONITOR."
WE ARE JERKS ON THE CREATIVE  SIDE. WE'RE CONSTANTLY CHANGING THINGS  AT THE LAST SECOND AND GUYS IN  OUR WARDROBE DEPARTMENT ARE LIKE "OH, REALLY, THAT'S WHAT YOU  WANT TO DO? GREAT. WE'LL JUST CALL THEM AND HAVE  THEM MAKE THAT OUTFIT. A BLUE SNUFFLEUPAGUS. BROWN'S TOO OBVIOUS?"  YEAH, WE GET SO USED TO -- AND  THEN YOU GO TO MOVIE SETS AND UNLESS YOU'RE LIKE ADAM SANDLER,  THEY CAN'T DO THAT STUFF THAT  FAST. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY DON'T  WANT TO.
RIGHT, THIS JACKET DOESN'T  FIT RIGHT AND THEY'RE LIKE  "YEAH, WELL."
"SORRY."
Jon: "LOSE WEIGHT. I'M NOT TAKING IT IN."
STOP EATING SANDWICHES AT  2:00 A.M., JERK.
Jon: ANY GOOD HOSTS COMING  UP.
WE HAVE JEREMY RENNER THIS  WEEKEND.
Jon: BAD ASS.
YEAH, HE IS.
Jon: STAY AWAY FROM HIM. HE CAN KILL PEOPLE.
I HAVE TO BE NEAR HIM.
Jon: THEN YOU'VE GOT A REAL  PROBLEM ON YOUR HANDS. I HOPE YOU SURVIVE. THANKS FOR COMING BY. JASON SUDEIKIS, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND
