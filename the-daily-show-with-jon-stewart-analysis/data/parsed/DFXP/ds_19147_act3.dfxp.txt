[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER. HER LATEST FILM IS CALLED "LAST DAYS IN VIETNAM."
I BORROWED A TRUCK, AND I BASICALLY SENT THE SIGNAL TO MY FOLKS. THIS MEANT A GROUP OF SOUTH VIETNAMESE MAJORS, LIEUTENANT COLONELS, COLONELS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO MUSTER AN ADDRESS IN DOWNTOWN SAIGON. I DROVE DOWN THERE. THEY LOADED UP ONTO THE TRUCK. AND I DROVE THEM TO THE AIR BASE. AND I HAD TOLD THEM, WHEN YOU HEAR THREE THUMPS, THAT MEANS HOLD THE BABIES' MOUTHS, DON'T BREATHE, DON'T TALK, DON'T MAKE ANY NOISE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE GATE POST.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME RORY KENNEDY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HELLO. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: FABULOUS. FABULOUS FILM.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THIS IS ABOUT THE EVACUATION OF SAIGON. YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE OF THE LESSER-KNOWN EPISODES OF THE VIETNAM WAR.
WELL, IT'S... YOU KNOW, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE ICONIC IMAGE OF THE HELICOPTER...
Jon: YES.
ON TOP OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK IS THE EMBASSY. IT'S, IN FACT, NOT THE EMBASSY. AND THE DESPERATION OF THE VIETNAMESE TRYING TO LEAVE DURING THOSE FINAL HOURS, AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS WE HAD APPEASED IN 1973. A PEACE ACCORD WAS SIGNED. WE NO LONGER HAD TROOPS. THIS IS NOW APRIL OF '75.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE NORTH COME IN. THE COUNTRY FALLS WITHIN FOUR MONTHS BECAUSE THE U.S. PRESENCE ISN'T THERE. AND IT FALLS MUCH QUICKER THAN ANYBODY EXPECTED. SO IT BECAME VERY DESPERATE. THE U.S. DECIDED WE JUST GOT TO GET THE AMERICANS OUT. AND LEAVE ALL OUR VIETNAMESE COUNTERPARTS BEHIND.
Jon: AND THEY'VE SURROUNDED SAIGON.
THEY'VE SURROUNDED --
Jon: BUT IN THE PEACE ACCORDS, THEY HAD PROMISED NOT TO DO THIS.
THEY HAD PROMISED NOT TO, BUT THEY BROKE THE PEACE ACCORD, AND THE U.S. HAD PROMISED... NIXON HAD PROMISED THE U.S. WILL COME IN IF THE NORTH ATTACKS, AND THEN, OF COURSE, NIXON HAD RESIGNED WITH WATERGATE. FORD WAS IN OFFICE. WE HAD PUT A CONGRESS IN POSITION WHERE THEY REALLY DIDN'T SUPPORT THE WAR IN VIETNAM. AS A COUNTRY WE DIDN'T SUPPORT THE WAR, AND WE JUST WEREN'T GOING TO GET BEHIND GETTING BACK INTO THE QUAGMIRE OF VIETNAM.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND SO THERE WAS NO SUPPORT BY THE U.S., AND THEY JUST WERE ABLE TO KIND OF... IT FELL LIKE A HOUSE OF CARDS.
Jon: IT'S AMAZING HOW UNITED STATES' HISTORY EXISTS IN SUCH SINGULAR FASHION, AND YOU NEVER SEE A CYCLE OF THESE TYPES OF...
NEVER REPEATS ITSELF? [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THIS IS WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS, MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, SO THERE ARE... THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING IN SAIGON, THE AMERICANS HAVE THESE ENORMOUS SUPPORT TEAMS OF VIETNAMESE WHO HAVE RISKED THEIR LIVES TO WORK WITH US.
WELL, EXACTLY. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE MANY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THERE OVER YEARS AND YEARS. AND THEY HAD, YOU KNOW, SOLDIERS HAD MARRIED VIETNAMESE. THEY HAD CHILDREN WHO WERE VIETNAMESE. THEY HAD THEIR COUNTERPARTS WHO THEY HAD BEEN WORKING WITH, AND IT'S ANYBODY FROM, YOU KNOW, AGENTS TO COOKS AND PEOPLE WHO DROVE THE CAR, ALL OF WHOM WERE THEN A GREATER RISK BECAUSE THEN, YOU KNOW, WE LEAVE THE COUNTRY, WE LEAVE THEM THERE THERE. THEY'RE ASSOCIATED WITH THE AMERICANS, AND THEN THEY'RE AT RISK FOR, YOU KNOW, BEING TORTURED, BEING KILLED AND BEING PUT INTO THESE REEDUCATION CAMPS, AS THEY WERE CALLED.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND SO THEY'RE VERY VULNERABLE AND, YOU KNOW, TO ME I THINK WE HAVE A REAL RESPONSIBILITY. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS AND WHAT THE FILM DOCUMENTS IS THE AMERICANS WHO ARE ON THE GROUND WHO WENT AGAINST U.S. POLICY...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND SAID, YOU KNOW, WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S ONLY AMERICANS GETTING OUT OF THIS COUNTRY, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THESE GUYS BEHIND, AND THEY COMMITTED, YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS REALLY ILLEGAL ACTS TO GET THE VIETNAMESE OUT. AND, IT'S REALLY A CELEBRATION OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS.
Jon: OBVIOUSLY IN THIS SITUATION DESPITE BEST EFFORTS OF REALLY GOOD PEOPLE WORKING HARD, PEOPLE WERE LEFT BEHIND. WHAT IS THAT LIKE NOW? DO THEY TRY AND CONTACT, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE THE STORIES OF THE SURVIVORS?
WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS IS ALL... THIS FILM IS IN THE CONTEXT OF LOSING A WAR AND ABANDONING A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE, SO --
Jon: SO IT'S LIKE A ROM COM.
THAT'S ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT. BUT, SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S, THAT'S THE CONTEXT OF IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND BUT WITHIN THAT THERE ARE THESE EXTRAORDINARY, HEROIC STORIES, AND WHAT HAPPENED TO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND IS THEY DID END UP IN THESE RESETTLEMENT CAMPS, REEDUCATION CAMPS AS THEY WERE CALLED, A MILLION PEOPLE, AND SOME OF THEM WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE AND EVENTUALLY COME TO THE UNITED STATES, SO WE NOW HAVE ABOUT TWO MILLION VIETNAMESE HERE IN THE COUNTRY.
Jon: RIGHT.
MANY OF WHOM, YOU KNOW, HAVE COME OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS AND A LOT OF WHOM CAME IN THE '70s AND 80s. ABOUT 130,000 COME DURING THE COURSE OF THE STORY WE DOCUMENT IN THIS FILM.
Jon: RIGHT. YOU MENTIONED, THOUGH, THAT WHEN YOU SCREENED THE FILM, THERE WERE SOME OF THE AMERICANS THAT HAD BEEN THERE THAT HAD TRIED VERY HARD, BUT THERE WERE ALSO SOME VIETNAMESE THERE. WHAT WAS THAT LIKE WHEN THEY GOT TOGETHER?
WELL, IT WAS REALLY INCREDIBLE. THE FILM PREMIERED AT THE SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL, AND IT WAS FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN IT IN THE THEATER OR ANYBODY HAD. WE INVITED A NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE FILM TO COME SEE IT. SO THEY HAD SEEN IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND IT WAS, YOU KNOW, AN AUDIENCE OF 700 PEOPLE, AND THEY CAME UP AND IT WAS A REALLY WONDERFUL MOMENT OF STANDING OVATIONS AND WHAT NOT, BUT ON THE STAGE WAS STU HARRINGTON...
Jon: RIGHT.
WHO, YOU KNOW, YOU SAW IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW, AND HE HAS AN INCREDIBLE STORY IN THE FILM BECAUSE HE'S VERY HEROIC, BUT HE ALSO HAS THIS MOMENT WHERE HE'S IN THE EMBASSY WHERE THE DECISION... THERE'S ABOUT 2,000 PEOPLE IN THE EMBASSY. BY 4:00 A.M., THEY'VE GOTTEN ABOUT 1,600 PEOPLE OUT, BUT THERE ARE 400 PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND. HE'S THEN TOLD THEY'RE NOT SENDING ANY MORE HELICOPTERS. SO HE THEN TELLS THESE PEOPLE, AND HE SPEAKS VIETNAMESE, WE'RE GOING TO SAVE YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU HERE, AND THEN HE LEAVES AND HE HIDES AND HE GOES UP TO THE TOP OF THE EMBASSY AND HE GETS IN A HELICOPTER AND HE LEAVES. AND HE LOOKS DOWN AT THE 420 PEOPLE HE LEFT BEHIND, AND HE'S HEARTBROKEN, AND HE SAYS, "THIS IS WRONG," YOU KNOW, AND HOW IT WAS A NUTSHELL OF AMERICAN POLICY. BUT AT SUNDANCE, ONE OF THE 420 WHO WAS LEFT BEHIND WAS ON STAGE WITH HIM, AND HE SAID ON STAGE, "I'VE LIVED IN FEAR OF RUNNING INTO ONE OF THE 420," AND SO BEN FO, WHO WAS ONE OF THE GUYS LEFT BEHIND, GRABBED THE MIC AND HE SAID, "STU, I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I FORGIVE YOU." AND IT WAS THIS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT.
Jon: YEAH. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
YEAH.
AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLY MOVING LOOK AT PART OF OUR HISTORY THAT I'M SURE WE'VE ALREADY FORGOTTEN. [LAUGHTER] SO, REALLY, REALLY WELL DONE. "LAST DAYS IN VIETNAM" OPENS IN NEW YORK SEPTEMBER 5TH. OPENS IN MORE CITIES IN THE COMING WEEKS. RORY KENNEDY.
