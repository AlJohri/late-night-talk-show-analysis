Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST  TONIGHT PULITZER WINNING  REPORTER. HE WRITES FOR THE "NEW YORK  TIMES" HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED  "SALT SUGAR FAT."  PLEASE WELCOME HIM TO THE  PROGRAM. SIR -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANKSES FOR HAVING ME HERE.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL I READ  THE BOOK AND IT WAS DELICIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] "SALT SUGAR FAT."  THE STORY OF HOW THE FOOD  CONGLOMERATES HAVE HOOKED US ON  THESE SUBSTANCES IS INCREDIBLY  UNAPPETIZING. IT'S SO SCIENTIFIC, HIS NO IDEA.
IT WAS, I TELL YOU, JON, FOR  ME IT WAS LIKE BEING INSIDE A  DETECTIVE STORY, WRITING AND  RESEARCHING. JUST LISTENING TO THEM TALK  ABOUT THE WAY, THE PRECISION  WHICH WITH THEY FORMULATE THEIR  FOOD. THE LEGEND OF INDUSTRY HOWARD  MOSKAWITZ WALKED US THROUGH A  DEVELOPMENT OF A SODA FLAVOR FOR DR. PEPPER AND TO FIND THE MOST  PERFECTLY SWEET FORMULA. TAKE 61 VERSIONS, EACH SLIGHTLY  DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER, 6,000  CONSUMER TASTE TESTS, DID IT IN THE COMPUTER, DID THE MATH  ANALYSIS AND CAME UP WITH THE  PRECISE AMOUNT OF SUGAR WHICH HE CALLS THE BLISS POINT,  GUARANTEED TO SEND US OVER THE  MOON, SEND THE PRODUCT FLYING OFF THE SHELF.
Jon: IT'S A DISTOPPIC, YOU  GET THE -- DYSTOPIC, YOU GET THE  IDEA OF GUYS BACK -- IN WHITE COATS IN THE BACK LET'S GET A  DROP OF SOMA THAT SHOULD WIN  THEM.
I DON'T SEE IT AS AN EVIL  EMPIRE THAT WAS OUT TO GIVE US  ILL. THEY ARE LIKE LOOK NONE OF  INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS INCLUDING  SODA OR MY FAVORITE POTATO CHIPS CAUSE THE PROBLEM HERE. THE PROBLEM LIES IN THEIR  COLLECTIVE FIELD. WHAT COMPANIES DO MAKE MORE  MONEY BY SELLING MORE PRODUCTS.
Jon: THIS IS NOT A BOOK OF  DEMONIZATION. IT'S A BOOK OF HOW COMPETITION  AND CHEAP FOOD. YOU LIKEN IT TO CHEAP ENERGY.
THIS IS THE HOLY GRAIL. THEY KNOW WHEN THEY USE THE  THREE INGREDIENTS IN THE RIGHT  AMOUNT THEY HAVE WINNERS. THE FIERCE COMPETITION. EVEN WHEN THE COMPANIES TRY TO  DO THE RIGHT THING BY CONSUMER  HEALTH, AND THEY HAVE. THE COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO DO  THE RIGHT THING THEY GET PUSHED  BACK BY WALL STREET. WHERE IS THE PROFIT?
Jon: RIGHT. YOU TALKED ABOUT SOUP. HERE IS SOMETHING FLAVORFUL BUT  THERE'S A LOT OF SALT IN IT,  SODIUM. THEY TEST THE FORMULATIONS AND  MAKE IT TASTE JUST AS GOOD --
ONE THE HEALTHY LINES AS THEY  CALL IT THEY CUT BACK ON A  LITTLE BIT. IT TOOK A HICCUP FROM WALL  STREET AND THEY PUT IT BACK N. THEY ARE LOOKING AT COMPETITION  IN THE SOUP AISLE AND THE  COMPETITORS ARE NOT DOING IT.
Jon: HOW DOES REAL FOOD  COMPETE? THE SAME WAY YOU TALK ABOUT IF  WE ALL HAD SOLAR PANELS ON OUR  HEADS WE WOULDN'T NEED CARS. PEOPLE WON'T DO THAT AS LONG AS  IT'S CHEAP AND EASY TO GET GS. HOW CAN REAL AND SUSTAINABLE  FOOD AND LIFESTYLES COMPETE IN  ANYWAY?
THE PLAYING FIELD IS SO  UNLEVEL. THE SUBSIDIES GO TO THE HIGHLY  PROCESSED FOOD. ALMOST NONE GO TO THE FRESH  FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. ONE THING THAT THE WHITE HOUSE  IS LOOKING AT WHICH IS LEVELING  THE PLAYING FIELD FROM THE  ECONOMICS. WHEN I GO TO --
Jon: STOP WITH THINGS THAT  MAKE IT EASIER.
YEAH, EVEN WHEN WE GO IN WITH  GOOD INTENTIONS TO BUY THE FOODS  WE SHOULD THE COST IS --
Jon: BEYOND THE COST  THERE'S CLEARLY A PHYSICAL AND  EMOTIONAL REACTION THAT YOU  HAVE. A BLISS POINT, LIKE YOU SAY,  THAT OCCURS. YOU'RE RIGHT IF A BANANA AND AN  APPLE ARE CHEAPER MAYBE I  WOULDN'T EAT A YODEL BUT HOLY (bleep) IT'S SO GOOD. IN THE BACK OF YOUR ROOM WHAT IS  IN THERE A GIANT BOWL OF WHAT?
YOU HAVE TO LOVE THE  LANGUAGE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE TERMS IS  BANISHING CAN A -- CALORIC  DENSITY. THAT'S THE CHEETO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED BUT  IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.
Jon: OH, I'VE NOTICED. [LAUGHTER]
WHEN IT DOES THAT IT SENDS A  SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN WHICH SAYS  JON, MICHAEL, KEEP EATING BECAUSE THE CALORIES HAVE  VANISHED. VANISHING CALL LORIC DENSITY.
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS  THAT. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS MY FRIEND. [LAUGHTER] I FOUND IT FASCINATING, TOO,  THAT WITHIN NESTLE, ONE OF THE  LARGER ONES, THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A DIVISION WHICH IS RESEARCHING  AND CREATING WAYS TO MITIGATE  THE PROBLEMS THEIR OTHER DIVISIONS ARE CREATING.
YES.
Jon: THE -- WHEN PEOPLE GET  OBESE AND THEY HAVE THE GAS  TRICK BYPASS SURGERY THEY ARE CREATING PRODUCTS THAT YOU CAN  FEED THEM WITH TUBES.
THEY ARE WORKING ALL ENDS. AND THEY HAVE 700 OR MORE  SCIENTISTS PLUGGING AWAY TRYING  TO MAKE THE MOST HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE FOOD, AND OTHER THE  OTHER SIDE, TOO TRYING TO MAKE  HEALTH PRODUCTS.
Jon: THEY ARE NICE PEOPLE,  NOT LIKE EVIL GENIUSES IN WHITE  LAB COATZ LIKE WE'LL DESTROY  SOCIETY.
THEY ARE FUN TO HANG OUT  WITH. THEY ARE PEOPLE YOU WANT TO HAVE  A BEER WITH. BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THEY  DON'T EAT THEIR OWN PRODUCTS.
Jon: THAT'S NOT TRUE?
THAT IS TRUE. THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST  SURPRISING THINGS ON A PERSONAL  LEVEL.
Jon: YEAH!
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GET TO A  HEALTH PROBLEM. THERE WAS A SENIOR SCIENTIST AT  KRAFT WHO COULDN'T RUN ANYMORE  AFTER HE BLEW OUT HIS KNEE. HE STOPPED DRINKING ANYTHING BUT  WATER. AND POTATOES.
Jon: THE OTHER THING YOU  CAN DO WHICH IS WHAT I'VE DONE  WHICH IS GIVE UP. CAN YOU STICK AROUND? >>
