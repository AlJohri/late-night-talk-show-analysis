( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A VERY FINE  ACTRESS. HER NEW FILM IS CALLED "THE  EAST."
YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING BY  POISONING THIS CREEK AND OTHER  RIVERS AND LAKES AND YOU SEPARATE YOURSELF IN YOUR GATED  COMMUNITIES WITH GOLF COURSES  FROM THE WORLD YOU'RE  DESTROYING. FROM THE FAMILIES WHO CANNOT  AFFORD TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS  CREEK. OR FROM THE CANCER THEIR  CHILDREN ARING DYING OF. YOU CREATE, FOR A LIVING, TOXIC  CHEMICALS THAT WILL OUTLIVE US  ALL AND FEELS NOTHING.
Jon:  STORY OF NANJING. PLEASE WELCOME WELCOME ELLEN  PAGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I COULDN'T BE A BIGGER FAN OF  YOUR SHOW.
Jon:  THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU. WE'RE BIG FANS OF YOURS. I'VE BEEN HERE OVER 27 YEARS. FROM THE SPHIRS DAY I STARTED I  SAID GET ME ELLEN PAGE.
HOW DID YOU KNOW MY MOM WAS  PREGNANT?
Jon:  HOW OLD ARE YOU?
26.
Jon:  I KNEW IT!
WAIT, HOW DID YOU KNOW MY MOM  WAS PREGNANT. I WAS IN A LITTLE CLUB IN  CANADA. HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA-- IF I MAY  SAY THIS AND THIS IS NOT TO  OFFEND PEOPLE IN CANADA WHO LIVE IN OTHER AREAS-- MAYBE THE MOST  BEAUTIFUL PLACE IN CANADA. IT'S PRETTY GORGEOUS IN TERMS  OF-- AND BY THE WAY, THE  LOX THAT THEY MAKE. MAKE.
I KNOW, YOU CANNOT BREAK  THOSE LOCKS LOCKS. THE AUDIENCE THAT WE GET  ( LAUGHTER )  IS SUCH A WEIRD MIX OF CANADIANS  AND RABBIS AND, LIKE, THAT I HAVE NO IDEA WHICH JOKE. IS THAT A POPULAR CALLING?
IT IS A VERY POPULAR CALLING.
Jon:  WHAT IS THIS THING? IT LOOKS VERY INTERESTING. ARE YOUING LIVING IN, LIKE A  COMMUNITY OF VERY ECHO MINDED  INDIVIDUALS.
THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A GROUP OF  ECOACTIVISTS OVER THE INCREDIBLE  INJUSTICE AND ATROCITIES BEING COMMITTED BY LARGE CORPORATIONS  AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
Jon:  SO IT'S A FICTION. CLEARLY, CORPORATIONS DON'T. AND THE FILM IS ABOUT A  CORPORATE SPRY WHO INFILTRATES  THE GROUP TO FIGURE OUT THEIR  PLAN.
Jon:  IS THIS A TRUE  STORY.
IT'S NOT BASED ON A SPECIFIC  TRUE STORY BUT OF COURSE  EVERYTHING IN THE FILM IS REAL THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING AND  VERY, VERY RELEVANT RIGHT NOW. ON THE ONE HAND YOU PROBABLY  HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR  PEOPLE FIGHTING TO PRESERVE THE JIERMT AND THOSE KINDS OF  THINGS. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, HOW DO  YOU JUSTICE SOME OF THEIR  ACTIONS WHICH ARE PRETTY DAMAGING AND PEOPLE GET HURT.
OF COURSE. THIS IS WHY I THINK THE FILM IS  INTERESTING. I BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE HAVE  INCREDIBLE VALIDITY WITH  THEIRANGER AND MISSION AND WHAT THEY'RE ANGRY AT. BUT OF COURSE I DON'T BELIEVE IN  HURTING PEOPLE.
Jon:  IT'S A VERY THIN  LINE BETWEEN SORT OF WHEN YOU  GET UP TO THAT AND WHAT IS RAICHOUS ACTIVISM WHAT IS  DANGEROUS.
OF COURSE. AND I THINK-- SARAH'S STRUGGLE  AS SHE STARTS GETTING A WINDOW  TO A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. AND TRIAL TO DEAL WITH THE  DIFFICULTIES THAT THAT PRESENTS  I AM VERY MUCH AN  ENVIRONMENTALIST. I RECYCLE. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH  NESPRO PODS? MY MOMENT IS BUILT WITH THEM. EVERY COFFEE DRINK I DRINK, I TO  IT AND IT GO WRITE INTO THE  FACADE OF MY BUILDING. PRETTY GNARLY SMELLING BUILDING. NOW, WHAT ARE YOU ARE YOU-- DO  YOU LIVE IN CANADA?
NO, I LIVE IN L.A.
Jon:  FOR SOMEONE FROM  SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PART OF THE  WORLD WHERE PEOPLE ARE KIND AND I WOULD THINK DOIN TO EARTH AND  HONEST. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WOW. ( BLEEP ), WHROOEP.
Jon:  HAVE YOU EVER  VISITED SOMEWHERE WHERE PEOPLE  WERE ANGRY ATICA NADIANS. NO BUT I WOULDN'T BLAME PLACES  FOR BEING ANGRY ATICA CANADIANS. I LOVE BEING FROM CANADA AND  LOVE A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE  COUNTRY BUT WE'RE NOT PERFECT ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YES, YOU ARE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  FROM A CANADIAN PERSPECTIVE,  WHAT WOULD YOU TAKE ISSUE WITH? BECAUSE WE LOOK AT IT UP THERE  AND WE THINK WHERE ARE YOUR BANK  FAILURES?
THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT  THINGS ABOUT CANADA. PUBLIC HEALTH CARE--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WHEN YOU HEAR, YOU KNOW, THE  MISINFORMATION FROM, YOU KNOW, CERTAIN NEWS NETWORKS ABOUT --
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING  ABOUT.
YOUR SISTER NEWS NETWORK,  FOXY NEWS. IT'S VERY FUNNY BECAUSE WHEN YOU  GROW UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT  IN CANADA AND THEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE SYSTEM HERE, AND  YOU'RE LIKE EXCUSE ME? WHAT? AND WE HAVE THE SITUATION WITH  THE TAR SANDS RIGHT NOW WHICH IS  DECIMATE, OUR ENVIRONMENT. BUT YOU HAVE SO MUCH ENVIRONMENT  TO DECIMATE.
EXACTLY.
Jon:  DO YOU LOOK AT US--  LIKE WHEN YOU LOOK AT US DO YOU  GUYS GO, LIKE, THOSE GUYS. OR IS IT MORE THEY'RE GOING TO  BREAK SOMETHING.
I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE MORE  MAYBE CAMARADERIE OF SPIRIT, A  LITTLE LESS FEAR AND WE THINK TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER A BIT  MORE AND DON'T SORT OF --
YOU'RE COMMIES.
WE ARE DIRTY COMMIES.
WELL, THE EAST IS GOING TO BE  IN THE THEATERS ON MAY 31. YOU HAVE TO BE A BIG FAN OF THIS  LADY. SHE'S WORRY VALENTED.
