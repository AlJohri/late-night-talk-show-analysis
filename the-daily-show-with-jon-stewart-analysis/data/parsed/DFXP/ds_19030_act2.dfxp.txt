[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW LIKE MOST PEOPLE THESE DAYS, I HAVE ONE SOURCE FOR NEWS THAT I TURN TO MORE THAN ANY OTHER TWEETER BECAUSE I LIKES MY NEWS LIKE I LIKES MY LADIES, SHORT AND PUNCHY AND DELIVERED SECONDHAND BY ANONYMOUS SOCIOPATHS. [LAUGHTER] THAT DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK HIGHLY OF ME, DOES IT? WITHOUT TWITTER HOW ELSE WOULD I LEARN ABOUT REVOLUTIONS IN IRAN OR NONEXISTENT FIGHTS WITH ANGRY LADIES ON AIRPLANES? AND THIS WEEKEND TWITTER CAME THROUGH AGAIN.
THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE TWEETED A PHOTO OF ROSA PARKS. THE CAPTION SAID TODAY WE REMEMBER ROSA PARKS' BOLD STAND AND A ROLE IN ENDING RACISM.
Jon: IT'S OVER! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AHHH! [LAUGHTER] IT'S OFFICIAL. STICK A FORK IN RACISM IT'S DONE. A FORK IN RACISM IT'S THANKS TO ROSA PARKS RACISM COMPLETELY ENDED. THAT'S WHY ALL HISTORY BOOKS ON RACISM POST 1955 ARE COMPLETELY EMPTY. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU MAY ASK WHY DID THEY MAKE IT SO BIG THEN? SHUT UP.
NOW, YOU MAY SAY TO YOURSELF, WELL, -- YOU MAY SAY TO YOURSELF WHAT QUALIFIES THE RNC TO MAKE THE CALL ABOUT RACISM BEING OVER. WHO WOULD KNOW BETTER WHETHER RACISM HAD ENDED THAN A GROUP OF OLD WHITE MEN. THEY ARE SAYING RACISM IS DONE. ONCE SOMETHING IS TWEETED YOU CAN'T TAKE IT BACK, RIGHT?
THE RNC TWEAKED THEIR TWEET AFTER MANY EXPRESSED ANGER AND DISMAY AT THE COMMENT.
Jon: YOU OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCE THE END TO RACISM AND THREE HOURS LATER YOU START IT AGAIN. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MAKES YOU? INDIAN GIVERS. I KNOW THAT IS RACIST BECAUSE RACISM IS BACK NOW THAT'S WHY I SAID IT. THAT'S RIGHT. I'M ALLOWED TO -- RACISM IS BACK -- IF IT WAS OVER -- [LAUGHTER] ARCHIE BUNKER DIED IN MY EAR. WHAT DID THEY SAY EXACTLY?
THE NEW TWEET READ PREVIOUS TWEET READ TODAY WE REMEMBER ROSA PARK'S BOLD STAND AND HER ROLE IN FIGHTING TO END RACISM.
I SUPPOSE IT'S A LITTLE MORE ACCURATE. THEY DID, LATER, HAVE TO ISSUE A THIRD TWEET CLARIFYING ALSO INSTEAD OF ROSA PARK'S BOLD STAND WE SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH REFUSAL TO STAND WHICH IS WHAT SHE DID AND TODAY WE REMEMBER #OOPS WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY AND BY REMEMBER WE DON'T MEAN WE EVER FORGOT HER BUT IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO AND WOW, AM I NOT OUT OF CHARACTERS OUT #TWITTER #OFUC AND THEN THE FINAL TWEET AND CAN WE JUST SAY HOW GOOD WAS THE BUTLER? THE MOVIE NOT BLACK PEOPLE AS BUTLERS NOT TO SAY THEY ARE BAD AT IT. AT IOH, NO HERE WE GO AGAIN #GOLATINOS WHY DO I KEEP HITTING SEND?
