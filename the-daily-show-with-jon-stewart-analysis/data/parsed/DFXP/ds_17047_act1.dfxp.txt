JANUARY 19th, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: BOOM, HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE-- YES, ALL RIGHT. SOMEONE JUST SNEEZED. MY GUEST FROM THE MOVIE "MAN ON THE LEDGE" ELIZABETH BANKS IS GOING TO JOIN US  LATER TONIGHT, BUT SOME OF WE WANT TO GET TO TONIGHT. YES, PLEASE, INDULGE YOUR APPLAUSE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: SO MUCH TO GET TO TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO DIVE RIGHT IN. A FEW WEEKS AGO SPUNKY YOUNG UPSTART HEARD THE PEM'S CALL AND DECIDED TO EXPLORE THE  POSSIBILITY OF JOINING THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF SOUTH CAROLINA. AND! WHEN HE DID, EVERYTHING CHANGED.
THE POLL SHOWS OBAMA AT 41%, ROMNEY AT 38%, THIS IS P-- POLL AND COLBERT AT 13%. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: 13%, 13%, 13% AFTER A WEEK. 1 WEEK. AT THIS RATE, SHOULD HE DECIDE TO RUN WE CAN PROJECT RIGHT NOW STEPHEN COLBERT  WILL WIN IN NOVEMBER WITH 546% OF THE VOTE. (APPLAUSE) STEPHEN COLBERT. IT'S INCREDIBLE. POWERFUL STORY, COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO HARDWORKING FAMILIES. BUT MOSTLY TO A SALVO OF DEVASTATING ADS CRAFTED BY HIS MASTERFULLY RUN SUPERPAC. I'M SURE STEPHEN HIMSELF WOULD THANK THIS ADROIT ORGANIZATION IF HE COULD, IF  ONLY HE COULD COMMUNICATE WITH THIS SUPERPAC DIRECTLY WHICH HE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T. BUT IF HE COULD HE--  (LAUGHTER) HOW POWERFUL IS COLBERT'S INFLUENCE BEEN ON THIS RACE? SINCE COLBERT THREATENED TO GET NOT RACE OTHER CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN JUMPING  OVERBOARD LIKE AN ITALIAN CRUISE SHIP CAPTAIN. YOU HEARD ME. E MY, THAT'S SO TOPICAL. FIRST HUNTSMAN AND THEN THIS MORNING.
THERE IS NO VIABLE PATH FORWARD FOR ME IN THIS 2012 CAMPAIGN. THEREFORE TODAY, MI SUSPENDING MY CAMPAIGN AND ENDORSING NEWT GINGRICH FOR PRESIDENT.
Jon: AND THEN, AND THEN THERE WAS, AND THEN THERE WAS A THIRD THING I WAS  GOING TO DO AND--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OH [BLEEP] I DON'T NEED TO REMEMBER ANY MORE. I AIN'T RUNNING FOR [BLEEP] PEWW, PEWW, I PULLED A MUSCLE. SO AT 11:16 A.M., THAT'S WHEN PERRY MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT, IT LOOKED LIKE CLEAR SKY FORCE NEWT  GINGRICH IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WHAT HAPPENED AT 11:19 A.M.?
IT'S NOT ALL CLEAR SKIES AHEAD FOR NEWT GINGRICH. ABC IS SET TO AIR AN INTERVIEW WITH GINGRICH'S EX-WIFE MARYANN.
THAT'S NEVER A GOOD THING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YES, RICK PERRY'S ENDORSEMENT OF NEWT GINGRICH GAVE THE FORMER SPEAKER A  THREE MINUTE RESPITE FROM THE NEWS THAT GINGRICH'S EX-WIFE WAS ABOUT TO GO  DIVORCE COURT ON HIS ASS. THREE MINUTES, GINGRICH BARELY HAD TIME TO HAVE A VICTORY AFFAIR. STILL, IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT NEWT'S EX-WIFE IS NOT A FAN OF HIS.
IT'S BEEN LONG REPORTED THAT GINGRICH DISCUSSED HIS DIVORCE FROM HIS FIRST WIFE  WHILE SHE WAS RECOVERING FROM CANCER SURGERY.
SHE WAS THE SECOND MRS. GINGRICH.
Jon: OH. OH, IT'S THE SECOND OF HIS THREE WIVES. MARYANN, THE JAN BRADY OF MRS. BEGINNING ITCHES. THE MEAT IN HIS WIFE HOAGIE, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK OF HIS WIVES. WHO IT ENDS KIND OF SAD BUT IN RETROSPECT IS REALLY THE BEST ONE IN SOME RESPECTS. WELL, AT LEAST I CAN'T IMAGINE MARYANN HAD AS BIG A BEEF WITH THE FORMER SPEAKER  THEN AS HIS FIRST WIFE.
IN THE CASE OF MARYANN, SHE JUST BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND HE WAS THERE AND TOLD DON'T PUT  ANY STRESS ON MARYANN,.
AND THEN HE ASKED FOR A DIVORCE.
YES.
FIRST WIFE CANCER, SECOND WIFE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, CAN NEWT GINGRICH BE  RECLASSIFIED AS A POLLUTANT? OF COURSE, THE GUY IS LIKE THE DIOXIN OF HUSBANDS.
WE'D BEEN MARRIED A LONG TIME. AND HE SAID YES, BUT YOU WANT ME ALL TO YOURSELF. CALISTA DOESN'T CARE WHAT I DO.
WHAT WAS HE SAYING TO YOU, DO YOU THINK?
HE WAS ASKING TO HAVE AN OPEN MARRIAGE. AND I REFUSED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I THINK I'M GOING TO BE SICK. AND THEN NEWT WILL LEAVE ME. STILL--  (APPLAUSE)
Jon: AS DISTURBING AS THE OPEN MARRIAGE REVELATION IS, THE OPEN MARRIAGE REVELATION IS IN KEEPING WITH NEWT'S PHILOSOPHY, HE'S A FREE  MARKET MAN, HE'S JUST ENCOURAGING COMPETITION, CREATIVE DESTRUCTION, PRO CREATIVE DESTRUCTION. HE WANTS HIS HANDS TO BE INVISIBLE. WELL, WE COULD GO ON LIKE THIS ALL DAY. FOR MORE ON THE NEWT GINGRICH OPEN MARRIAGE CORRESPONDENT-- BOMBSHELL WE TURN TO JOHN OLIVER. JOHN, THIS NEWS, IT'S REALLY BAD TIME, THE NEW BREAKS JUST AS GINGRICH WAS GAINING  MOMENTUM IN SOUTH CAROLINA. DOES THIS PUT A STOP TO GINGRICH'S MOMENTUM.
NOT AT ALL, JON. THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE, NOBODY CARES ABOUT THIS.
Jon: NO IT'S ABOUT THE HYPOCRISY, JOHN. LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING. LOOK AT THIS.
WE SHOULD REESTABLISH THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY.
SAFEGUARD THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE.
THE REPUBLICAN COMMITMENT TO THE VALUES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
I THINK THAT FOR MOST AMERICANS, DEFENDING TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS A  LEGITIMATE PART OF THEIR VALUE SYSTEM.
Jon: YOU DON'T THINK THAT THAT HURTS SOMEONE WHO PORTRAYS THEMSELVES AS A  CHAMPION OF TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE?
JON WHAT COULD BE MORE TRADITIONAL THAN THE ARRANGEMENT THAT GINGRICH PROPOSED. THROUGHOUT HISTORY, JON, TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE HAVE MEANT POWERFUL MEN DOING WHATEVER THE [BLEEP] THEY  WANT, WHENEVER THE [BLEEP] THEY WANT TO.
Jon: YOU KNOW THIS WILL DEFINITELY HURT HIM IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA WHICH IS  NEXT F BOCA IS ANY INDICATION THAT PLACE IS A HOT BED OF AGGRIEVED FIRST WIVES.
AGAIN, AGAIN, ARE YOU WRONG, JON, YOU'RE SIMPLY WRONG, GINGRICH CAN SIMPLY  MAKE THE CASE, DON'T LOOK AT WHAT I DID, LOOK AT THE SKILL IT TOOK ME TO DO IT. WITH WASHINGTON HOPELESSLY GRIDLOCK HE REQUEST SELL HIS AUDACITY AS A NEGOTIATING STRENGTH. DOW REALLY THINK THE CHINESE WANT TO GO TOE-TO-TOE ON DEBT NEGOTIATIONS WITH A GUY  WHO TRIED TO GET HIS RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WIFE TO SWING? NO WAY! THE CHINESE DON'T STAND A CHANCE IN THOSE TALK, JON. THEIR CULTURE IS BASED ON SHAME AND NEWT GINGRICH HAS NON.
Jon: I SEE. YOU REALLY BELIEVE-- CHERS PLAUS.
Jon: YOU REALLY BELIEVE HE CAN USE THIS NEWS TO HIS ADVANTAGE.
ABSOLUTELY. LOOK AT THE FACTS. THIS EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY REPUGNANT MAN.
Jon: OF COURSE.
WHO ON HIS BEST DAY PLACES IN A QUITE SCHRUTE LOOK ALIKE CONTEST, AND WHO  ON HIS WORST DAY RAMPAGES THROUGH THE CITY OF NEW YORK, HAS SOMEHOW, JON, SOMEHOW LIKE A JUDO MASTER CHANNELED HIS WEAKNESSES INTO STRENGTHS. AND HAS BEEN CUTTING A  [BLEEP] PATH THROUGH AMERICA.
AND SO IT IS YOUR ESTIMATION NO DAMAGE HE EMBRACES THIS.
AND THAT IS CERTAINLY TRUE IF HIS NEW CAMPAIGN SHOWS ANY INDICATION. HE'S ALREADY DONE T JON. HE'S ALREADY THERE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JON,
