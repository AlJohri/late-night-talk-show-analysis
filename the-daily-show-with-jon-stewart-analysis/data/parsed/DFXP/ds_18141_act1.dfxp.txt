John: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW"! MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER, I'M  STILL HERE FOR JON STEWART WHO,  DUE TO A COMICAL MIXUP, IS CURRENTLY HOSTING "THE DOILY  SHOW" AMERICA'S GREATEST  SATIRICAL LACE CENTERPIECE  PROGRAM. (LAUGHTER)  HE IS EVISCERATING THAT LACE  WORK AND THAT'S A DIRECT COPY  QUOTE. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS SENATOR  RAND PAUL, HE'S GOING TO BE WITH  US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HE'S ALSO WHERE WE BEGIN  TONIGHT. WHAT HAS SENATOR PAUL BEEN UP  TO?
SENATOR RAND PAUL OF KENTUCKY  HEADS TO IOWA.
HE HAS PLANNED TO VISIT SOUTH  CAROLINA AND NEVADA.
TOMORROW HE HEADLINES A  G.O.P. DINNER NEW HAMPSHIRE.
I KNOW RAND PAUL, I THINK  HE'LL RUN IN 2016.
WHAT STANDS BETWEEN THE PAUL  DYNASTY AND 2016?
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU THE FIRST  THING THAT STANDS BETWEEN THEM,  THREE (BLEEP)ING YEARS! (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S OVER 50 NEW IPHONES FROM  NOW. (LAUGHTER)  WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THIS  ELECTION? THAT BRINGS US TO YET ANOTHER  INSTALLMENT OF "CAN'T YOU AT  LEAST WAIT UNTIL JON STEWART COMES BACK?"  (LAUGHTER)  SERIOUSLY! THIS IS MY LAST WEEK DOING THIS! IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE MEDIA IS  ALREADY RAMPING UP THEIR 2016  COVERAGE, IT'S THIS SOME OF THEM ARE ALREADY TRYING TO WIND IT  DOWN.
I PREDICT THE HARD RIGHT IS  GOING TO TAKE OVER THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY IN 2016 AND THE NOMINATION IS GOING TO RAND  PAUL. YOU WATCH. THIS IS WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.
Jon: OOH! (LAUGHTER)  REALLY? BECAUSE ALL THIS TIME I THOUGHT  YOU WERE PAID TO SPIT ON A  CAMERA LENS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT, LOOK, IF MAKING SOUND  PREDICTIONS IS WHAT CHRIS  MATTHEWS DOES FOR A LIVING THEN HE MAY HAVE A BIT OF A PROBLEM  BECAUSE FINDING SOUNDBITES OF  PEOPLE SAYING THINGS THAT DIRECTLY CONTRADICT THE CLAIM  THEY'VE JUST MADE, THAT'S WHAT  WE DO FOR A LIVING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SO OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, WHO  DID CHRIS MATTHEWS SEE GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN  2008?
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT RUDY  GIULIANI. I BELIEVE HE'S NOT ONLY RUNNING,  I THINK HE'S GOING TO WIN THIS  WHOLE THING COME AROUND THE NEXT  ELECTION.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH. YOU REMEMBER HIM? CURRENT PRESIDENT RUDY GIULIANI? (LAUGHTER)  YOU REMEMBER THE FORMIDABLE  CONTENDER IN THE 2008 ELECTION  WHO WON IN THE PRIMARIES ONLY ONE MORE DELEGATE THAN I DID. (LAUGHTER)  BUT LOOK, LET'S BE FAIR. THAT WAS A WHOLE PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTION AGO. EVERYONE IS ALLOWED A MULLIGAN  AND MATTHEWS MADE UP FOR THAT BY  COMPLETELY NAILING HIS PREDICTION FOR WHO WOULD WIN THE  REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES IN 2012.
YOU WATCH BACHMANN. SHE'S GOT THE ACTION THIS TIME. SHE STANDS FOR SOMETHING --  SHE'S GOING ALL THE WAY. SHE'S GOING TO WIN THIS THING.
REALLY?
I TELL YOU RIGHT NOW. I PREDICT SHE BEATS TRUMP.
John: IT'S WHAT HE DOES FOR A  LIVING. (LAUGHTER)  IS HE A PSYCHIC OR A TIME  TRAVELER? EITHER WAY, WE MUST BURN HIM AS  A WITCH. CHRIS MATTHEWS DOESN'T JUST  ROUTINELY HAVE EGG ON HIS FACE,  HE HAS A CHICKEN COP AGO SQUAT OVER HIS FACE, LAYING AN EGG  BETWEEN HIS EYES, (BLEEP)ING ON  THAT EGG, PUNTING THE EGG AND THEN RUBBING IT ALL OVER HIS  FACE. (APPLAUSE)  LOOK, AMERICA, AMERICA, LOOK AT  ME. OUR ELECTIONS DO NOT NEED TO  TAKE AS LONG AS THEY CURRENTLY  DO. THERE IS ANOTHER WAY. AND THE PROOF OF THAT HAVE IS  RIGHT UNDER YOUR FEET-- THROUGH  SEVERAL LAYERS ACROSS THE MUD,  AUSTRALIA.
PRIME MINISTER KEVIN RUDD HAS  PUT AN END TO WEEKS OF  SPECULATION, HE'S CALLED AN ELECTION FOR SEPTEMBER 7.
John: THE WHOLE ELECTION  SEASON IS JUST ONE MONTH LONG. FOUR WEEKS! THAT'S LIKE ONLY THREE NEW  IPHONES FROM NOW! (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? WE NEED TO LAUNCH OUR FULL  COVERAGE OF DOWN-UNDER-CISION  2013. (LAUGHTER)  (AS AN AUSTRALIAN)  THAT'S NOT A CAMPAIGN, THIS IS A  CAMPAIGN! BROUGHT TO YOU BY KOALAS. KOALAS, LIKE IF TEDDY BEARS WERE  ALIVE AND SURPRISINGLY  AGGRESSIVE. KOALAS. AUSTRALIA MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING  TO TEACH US WHEN IT COMES TO  DEMOCRACY STARTING WITH THIS:
IN AUSTRALIA, THEY HAVE A  COMPULSORY VOTING SYSTEM SO  EVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER TO VOTE AND TO TURN OUT TO VOTE  AND IF THEY DON'T THEY'RE FINED.
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S ILLEGAL  NOT TO VOTE THERE. THEY SPEND A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME  AND ENERGY GETTING PEOPLE TO THE  POLLS RATHER THAN SPENDING TIME, ENERGY, AND A SUPREME COURT  DECISION PREVENTING THEM. (LAUGHTER)  BUT YOU MIGHT THINK, "HOLD ON,  JOHN, IF OUR ELECTIONS WERE JUST  FOUR WEEKS WE WOULDN'T HAVE ALL THE FUN OF WATCHING THE HUMAN  GAFFER LAUNCHES ON THE CAMPAIGN  TRAIL."  (LAUGHTER) HERE'S THE THING: YOU'RE WRONG. NAME A GREAT CAMPAIGN MOMENT AND  AUSTRALIA WILL GET TO IT THIS  MONTH. AUNT CLUMSY ON-CAMERA PRATTFUL  BY A CANDIDATE? CHECK.
ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE PAST  TIMES DURING CAMPAIGNS IS TO  KISS BABIES AND HE TRIED TO DO THAT YESTERDAY, HE WENT IN FOR  THE KISS BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE  THE MOTHER TURNED AWAY AND HE ENDED UP PUTTING HIS LIPS ON THE  BACK OF THE MOTHER'S HEAD. IT WAS A CRAZY MOMENT.
Jon: OH! YES, YES THAT'S A CREEPY MOMENT. KISSING THE BACK OF A WOMAN'S  HEAD. BUT ASK YOURSELF THIS: IS IT  REALLY ANY CREEPIER THAN A  STRANGER PRESSING HIS LIPS AGAINST THE HEAD OF A  NON-CONSENTING BABY? BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY SEEMS JUST  AS CREEPY TO ME. IT'S NOT JUST PHYSICAL SLIPUPS,  IT'S ALSO VERBAL ATROCITIES. LIKE RICK PERRY'S INABILITY TO  NAME THE THIRD OF THE THREE  DEPARTMENTS HE WAS GOING TO  ELIMINATE. WE ALL REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE  WHEN THAT HAPPENED. I WAS HERE, WATCHING T.V. THANKING GOD FOR THE EXISTENCE  OF RICK PERRY. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, DON'T WORRY, AUSTRALIA'S  GOT YOU COVERED THERE, TOO. MEET THE LIBERAL PARTY'S JAYMES  DIAZ AND HIS SIX-POINT PLAN TO  STOP ILLEGAL BOAT IMMIGRATION.
WE HAVE A PLAN, A SIX-POINT  PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO  STOP THE BOATS.
COULD YOU RUN THROUGH THE SIX  POINTS?
WELL, I CAN RUN THROUGH THE  DETAILS OF THE POINTS. THE MAIN THING IS --
THE SIX POINTS. THE SIX POINTS ARE?
WELL -- ONE OF THE POINTS IS  -- THE KEY POINT WILL BE  STOPPING THE BOATS. (LAUGHTER)
John: OF COURSE IT IS! POINT ONE OF HIS SIX-POINT STOP  THE BOAT PLAN IS NATURALLY STOP  THE BOATS. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  NOW, LOOK, IN AMERICA -- HERE IN  AMERICA THE REPORTERS PROBABLY WOULD HAVE LEFT IT THERE  THINKING "JOB DONE, THE MAN HAS  BEEN COMPLETELY HUMILIATED." IN AUSTRALIA THEY ONLY HAVE ONE  MONTH OF THIS ELECTORAL BUFFET  SO THIS REPORTER-- HOW SHOULD I PUT IT-- HE TOSSED ANOTHER  QUESTION ON THE BARBIE.
WHAT WERE THE OTHER FIVE  POINTS? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, LOOK, IT IS UNDER THE  LABOUR PARTY --
THE OTHER FIVE POINTS?
WELL, I'VE ANSWERED YOUR  QUESTION.
YOU'VE SAID STOP THE BOATS. YOU SAID THERE WAS A SIX POINT  PLAN. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER FIVE  POINTS?
WELL, WE HAVE A PLAN TO STOP  THE BOATS AND I'VE ANSWERED  THAT.
NO OTHER POINTS? (LAUGHTER)
John: HELP HIM! SOMEBODY HELP HIM! LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU, POINT TWO  IS THIS: HEY, EVERYBODY, OH, MY  GOD, LOOK, A MOUSE RIDING A CAT! THEN YOU RUN AWAY! AND IF YOU THINK AUSTRALIA  DOESN'T ALSO MAKE TIME TO THROW  IN A FUN SEXTING SIDESHOW ALLAH ANTHONY WEINER A.K.A. SENIOR  DANGER. ♪ DANGER, DANGER ♪  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IF YOU THINK, THAT YOU ARE ABOUT  TO BE VERY UNPLEASANTLY  SURPRISED.
A QUEENSLAND M.P. CAUGHT UP  IN A SEXTING SCANDAL SENT TEXT  MESSAGES CONTAINING LEWD PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIMSELF TO HIS  MISTRESS INCLUDING ONE OF HIS  PENIS IN A GLASS OF RED WINE. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
John: THAT IS DISGUSTING! YOU DO NOT PAIR A PENIS WITH RED  WINE! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  YOU WANT SOMETHING LIGHTER,  CRISPER TO OFFSET THE NUTTYER NOTES OF THE PENIS. (LAUGHTER)  PLUS, IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO  GET RED WINE STAINS OUT OF A  PENIS. BELIEVE ME. (LAUGHTER)  HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO SOAK THAT  THING IN CLUB SODA FOR HOURS. (LAUGHTER)  SO IN JUST FOUR WEEKS AUSTRALIA  ALREADY HAS A RICK PERRY AND AN  ANTHONY WEINER. OF COURSE, THE REAL TEST, DOES  IT HAVE A RIGHT WING WOMAN  THRUST INTO A NATIONAL POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT SHE'S NOT ONLY  UNPREPARED FOR BUT AT TIMES  SEEMS TO BARELY COMPREHEND. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT I'M ASKING IS DOES  AUSTRALIA HAVE A SNARP
A MOTHER ACCUSED OF AN  ANTI-MUSLIM CONTAMINATION SCARE  AT A SHOPPING CENTER WILL STAND AS A ONE NATION CANDIDATE AT  NEXT MONTH'S ELECTION.
I DON'T OPPOSE ISLAM AS A  COUNTRY BUT I DO FEEL THAT THEIR  LAWS SHOULD NOT BE WELCOME HERE IN AUSTRALIA. LESS THAN 2% OF AUSTRALIANS  FOLLOW HARAM.
OR THE KORAN AS THE ISLAMIC  TEXT IS KNOWN. (LAUGHTER)
John: SHE'S NOT JUST SARAH  PALIN, SHE'S A TURBO PALIN! (LAUGHTER)  THAT WOMAN IS STEPHANIE  BANNISTER, NOT ONLY DOES SHE  THINK ISLAMIC LAW IS CALLED HARAM WHICH IS A MISUSE OF A  MUSLIM TERM FOR SIMPLE BEHAVIOR,  SHE ALSO THINKS ISLAM IS A  COUNTRY. PERHAPS IN THE MISTAKEN BELIEF  THAT THE NATION OF ISLAM IS AN  ACTUAL NATION. (AS AN AUSTRALIAN)  THEY CAN DRESS HOWEVER THEY LIKE  OVER THERE BUT AS AN AUSTRALIAN I DON'T WANT TO BE FORCED TO  WEAR A BOW TIE. OR AS WE CALL IN THE AUSTRALIA,  A TWIZZLEY CHOKER. (LAUGHTER)  BANNISTER HAS SET A NEW  WATERMARK, A NEW LOW WATERMARK  FOR ELECTORAL IGNORANCE.
KOSHER FOOD FOR JEWISH  AUSTRALIANS ARE FINE.
JEWS UNDER HARAM THEY HAVE  THEIR OWN RELIGION WHICH FOLLOWS  JESUS CHRIST.
JUDAISM REJECTS YES US IS  CHRIST.
AUSTRALIA, YOU TRULY ARE A  NATION OF CRIMINALS WITHOUT WAS  W THAT MAGNIFICENT SOUNDBITE YOU JUST STOLE MY HEART! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  THAT INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE LAST  WEEK AND THERE'S BEEN AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT SINCE  THEN.
STEPHANIE BANNISTER HAS NOW  PULLED OUT OF THE RACE.
SHE'S LIKE PURE UNCUT PALIN. SHE QUIT A JOB SHE DIDN'T EVEN  HAVE YET! YOU SEE, THAT IS WHY THE CONCEPT  OF A FOUR-WEEK ELECTION IS SO  ATTRACTIVE. IT SPEEDS EVERYTHING UP. WEEK ONE: CANDIDATE ANNOUNCES. WEEK TWO: SHE SAYS SOMETHING  STUPID. WEEK THREE: SHE'S SMACKED DOWN  BY THE PRESS. WEEK FOUR: SHE WITHDRAWS. WEEK FIVE: THERE IS NO WEEK FIVE  AND NOBODY EVER HEARS FROM HER  EVER AGAIN! WE CAN HAVE THIS, TOO, AMERICA! IF WE ALL JUST AGREE NOT TO SAY  ANOTHER (BLEEP)ING WORD ABOUT  THE 2016 ELECTION. HERE, LOOK, I'VE SET AN ALARM  CLOCK HERE FOR 2016. WHEN THAT GOES OFF, EVERYONE IS  ALLOWED TO GO NUTS. UNTIL THEN, PLEASE PRETEND WE  DON'T GIVE A (BLEEP). BECAUSE DEEP DOWN WE REALLY  DON'T. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
