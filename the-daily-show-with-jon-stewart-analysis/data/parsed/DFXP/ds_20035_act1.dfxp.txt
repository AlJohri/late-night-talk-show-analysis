FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  HEY! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. MY GUEST, SUKI KIM. SHE IS THE AUTHOR OF "WITHOUT YOU, THERE IS NO US." IT'S A BOOK ABOUT HER TIME TEACHING IN NORTH KOREA. WHAT! YES! BUT FIRST, I'LL TELL YOU, IT'S AN EXCITING NIGHT. IT'S SNOWING OUT HERE, AND YOU GOT THE WHOLE THING. HOLD ON. I'M SO EXCITED. HOLD ON. LET ME JUST GET ALL THE PENS. OKAY... YEAH. IT'S A WHOLE WONDERLAND DOWN THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) OF 29-CENT PENS. ALRIGHT! THE EXCITING THING TONIGHT IS WE HAVE A CHOICE OF STORIES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR YOU. YOU'VE GOT YOUR ROYAL COUPLE ON A MAGICAL, WHIRLWIND FROLIC OF NEW YORK CITY. PIP-PIP, CHERIO. OR THE AFTERMATH OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE'S TORTURE REPORT. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT CHOICE DO WE MAKE ON THIS HOLIDAY SEASON HUMP DAY? YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T I JUST FLIP A COIN, FLIP A COIN. HEADS, WE DO THE SUPER-FUN ROYAL VISIT. TAILS, A SWAN DIVE INTO THE GRIM MORASS OF SATAN'S ANUS. HERE WE GO. HEADS FUN, TAILS MOTHER (BLEEP). ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? ACTUALLY, LET ME JUST PICK A CARD AT RANDOM. I'M GOING TO PICK A CARD AT RANDOM. I'M GOING TO GO THERE. IF, IF IT'S THE ACE OF HEARTS. WE'LL DO THE TORTURE STORY. 1 IN 52, AND WE'LL-- ( BLEEP ). OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT. OKAY. OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT? OKAY. OKAY. LET'S MAKE IT A GAME OF SKILL. ( LAUGHTER ) CAN I BROTHER GET A JAR OF JELLYBEANS OUT HERE, PLEASE. CAN I GET?
STEP RIGHT UP! STEP RIGHT UP.
Jon:  OKAY!
HOW MANY JELLYBEANS ARE IN THE JAR!
Jon:  ALRIGHT, HERE WE GO. IF I GUESS THE EXACT NUMBER OF JELLYBEANS IN THE JAR, THAT MY FRIEND JORDAN IS HOLDING UP, WE DO THE TORTURE REPORT. SO HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY. FIVE, FIVE JELLYBEANS.
SERIOUSLY?
Jon:  YEAH, FIVE.
ARE YOU ( BLEEP ) ME, STEWART. SERIOUSLY?
Jon:  NO, FIVE. YEP.
FIVE JELLYBEANS IS CORRECT!
Jon:  OH, MY GOD.
YOU WIN YOURSELF A TORTURE REPORT! ( LAUGHTER ) DON'T READ IT ALL AT ONCE. IT WILL MAKE YOU PUKE.
Jon: ALRIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JORDAN. I APPRECIATE IT. ALRIGHT. WELL, BY NOW, WE'VE ALL HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DIGEST, IN ALL ITS PRUTRID GLORY THE SHOCKING ACTS CARRIED OUT BY OUR GOVERNMENT AFTER 9/11 IN THE NAME OF KEEPING US SAFE FROM FORCED RECTAL HYDRATION TO A HALF NAKED PRISONER DYING OF HYPOTHERMIA, CHAINED TO A FLOOR. ON THE OTHER HAND, ISN'T 24 HOURS LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO FEEL BAD ABOUT OURSELVES AS A COUNTRY? ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, THERE'S GOT TO BE MYRIAD WAYS WE CAN MINIMIZE THIS. TO THE PUSH-BACK MOBILE.
GEORGE TENET WAS THE HEAD OF THE C.I.A. HE MAINTAINS IT WASN'T TORTURE.
DICK CHENEY IS SLAMMING THE RELEASE OF THIS REPORT AND THE REFERENCES TO, HE SAYS, SO-CALLED TORTURE.
GENERAL, DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT TOOK PLACE WAS TORTURE?
NO, LEGALLY NOT.
Jon:  LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THE RELEASE OF THIS REPORT PUTS THESE GENTLEMEN IN A STRESSFUL AND PAINFUL POSITION, IN THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY SAY ANYTHING TO MAKE IT STOP, BUT-- ( LAUGHTER ) NOT TORTURE? I MEAN, SLEEP DEPRIVATION. FORCED STRESS POSITIONS. WATERBOARDING. BEATINGS -- I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY. I'M READING THAT FROM WHAT THE GERMANS DID TO U.S. SOLDIERS AND OUR ALLIES IN WORLD WAR II, WHICH WE SUBSEQUENTLY TREATED AS WAR CRIMES AND PROSECUTED AT THE NUREMBURG TRIALS. MY CONFUSION. BUT IF IT'S NOT TORTURE, IT'S NOT TORTURE. CASED CLOSED. MOVING ON. THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE BID A FOND FAREWELL TO THE BIG APPLE TODAY-- ( COUGHING ).
JON. BEANS DON'T LIE.
Jon:  WHY MUST YOU HAUNT ME, JELLYBEAN CARNIE? ALRIGHT. FINE. (BLEEP) IT. WHY ELSE SHOULDN'T WE BE RELEASING THIS REPORT?
THIS IS REOPENING AN OLD WOUND.
WE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE.
THIS IS ACTUALLY ALL OLD NEWS.
TO COME BACK NOW THIS MANY YEARS LATER IS NOT GOING TO DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD.
Jon: YES, SO MANY YEARS LATER. ( LAUGHTER ) IT ALL HAPPENED IN THE YEAR 2000 AND OUGHT TWO. I REMEMBER CARS RAN ON GASOLINE, AND SPIDER-MAN WAS PLAYED BY ONE TOBIAS MAGUIRE. ( LAUGHTER ) NOT THIS NEW-FANGLED ANDREW GARFIELD. ( LAUGHTER ) SO APPARENTLY, WHAT WE DID WASN'T TORTURE. AND EVEN IF IT WAS TORTURE, WHO CAN REMEMBER ALL THE WAY BACK THEN? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, OF COURSE, WHILE IT'S BEST NOT TO REMEMBER THINGS FROM THAT TIME THAT IMPLICATE US, SURELY WE MUST NEVER FORGET THE THINGS THAT WILL EXONERATE US.
IT IS CRITICAL TO REMEMBER, AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, THE FEAR OF A FOLLOW-ON ATTACK WAS PERVASIVE, AND IT WAS GENUINE. THE NATION WAS TRAUMATIZED.
Jon:  BUT WE WERE SCARED. SURELY, A TEMPORARY STATE OF AGITATION CAN BE USED AS A DEFENSE OF ANY CRIME. FOR INSTANCE, MY CLIENT, MR. JEFFREY DAHMER, YES, HE KILLED AND ATE HIS NEIGHBORS, BUT AT THE TIME, HE WAS HUNGRY. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, AS YOU CAN SEE, HE'S PLEASINGLY FULL, AND HIS DEPRAVITY HAS CEASED. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, WE DIDN'T TORTURE, WE THINK. IT WAS SO LONG AGO THAT WE DON'T EVEN REALLY REMEMBER, BUT WE DO REMEMBER BEING SCARED. HERE'S HOW TWISTED UP YOU HAVE TO BE TO TRY NOT TO ADDRESS THE REALITY OF OUR ACTIONS. THIS IS FORMER BUSH ADMINISTRATION COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR NICOLLE WALLACE, EXPLAINING WHY NO MATTER WHAT WE DO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO KILL US IN AMERICA. AND WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT TORTURE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO KILL US, ALL DURING THE SAME PROGRAM.
I THINK WORDS MATTER. I THINK YOU MADE THAT PRETTY CLEAR THIS MORNING. AND SENATOR KERRY IS, I THINK, CORRECTLY CONCERNED THAT DEBATES LIKE THE ONE WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW MAY ENDANGER AMERICAN LIVES. THE NOTION THAT WE WE DO AFFECTS THE BEHAVIOR OF TERRORISTS, IT'S A LIE. IT'S A LIE PERPETRATED BY POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AND BY LIBERALS, AND IT'S DANGEROUS.
Jon: WHAT THE ( BLEEP ). HAVING THIS DEBATE PUTS US IN DANGER BUT WHAT WE DO -- SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE TORTURE REPORT. WORDS SPEAK LOUDER THAN ACTIONS. NOW WE GET TO THE REAL ARGUMENT THAT NO MATTER WHO WE SAY WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, DON'T THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS?
PEOPLE AT THE C.I.A. WHO WORKED WITH THIS PROGRAM KNOW IT WORKED.
AN AWFUL LOT OF ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE COLLECTED UNDER THE C.I.A. PROGRAM--
SOMETIMES YOU DO GET THE INFORMATION YOU NEED.
THE PROGRAM HAD PROVEN ITS WORTH.
HAS PRODUCED RESULTS, DOES PRODUCE RESULTS.
PEOPLE WILL TALK WHEN THEY'RE UNDER DURESS.
Jon:  YES, GENERALLY SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, "OW. STOP. OW. I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING-- OW." I DON'T HAVE THE WORDS ANYMORE. I WISH I HAD AN ELOQUENCE THAT I COULD EXPRESS.
OUR ENEMIES ACT WITHOUT CONSCIENCE. WE MUST NOT.
Jon:  OH, MY GOD. UNCLE JOHNNY. IS THAT YOU? ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH. DID THE STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS JUST PULL INTO TRUTH TOWN?
THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT MAKES CLEAR THAT ACTING WITHOUT CONSCIENCE ISN'T NECESSARY. IT ISN'T EVEN HELPFUL. PRACTICES THAT I BELIEVE NOT ONLY FAILED THEIR PURPOSE TO SECURE ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE TO PREVENT FURTHER ATTACKS ON THE U.S. AND OUR ALLIES, BUT ACTUALLY DAMAGED OUR SECURITY INTERESTS.
Jon: YEAH. ( BLEEP ). I FORGOT HOW ( BLEEP ) HIGH GOOD McCAIN MAKES ME FEEL WHEN I HAVEN'T HAD ANY FOR A WHILE! OH, MAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH! COME ON, GOOD McCAIN! GIVE ME ANOTHER HIT, BROTHER!
IN THE END, TORTURE'S FAILURE TO SERVE ITS INTENDED PURPOSE ISN'T THE MAIN REASON TO OPPOSE ITS USE. IT'S ABOUT US. IT'S ABOUT WHO WE WERE, WHO WE ARE, AND WHO WE ASPIRE TO BE. IT'S ABOUT HOW WE REPRESENT OURSELVES TO THE WORLD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: I DIDN'T THINK I'D EVER SEE YOU AGAIN, LIKE LASERDISCS OR MYSPACE, BUT YOU'RE BACK. DON'T EVER LEAVE ME AGAIN. TAKE US HOME, SENATOR.
THE TRUTH IS SOMETIMES A HARD PILL TO SWALLOW. ♪  ♪ BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO IT. WE NEED ONLY REMEMBER WHEN FACING CRUELTY, SUFFERING, AND LOSS, THAT WE ARE ALWAYS AMERICANS. DIFFERENT, STRONGER, AND BETTER THAN THOSE WHO WOULD DESTROY US. ( APPLAUSE ) ♪  ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WHOOO! HOOZA! HOOZA! YOU KNOW, I SHOULD PROBABLY BE DEPRESSED THAT SOMEONE IN THE GOVERNMENT DESERVES MASSIVE APPLAUSE FOR SAYING WE SHOULDN'T TORTURE PEOPLE AND THAT WE SHOULD FIND OUT ABOUT IT BUT I'M STILL JUST SO HAPPY THAT SOMEONE ACTUALLY SAID IT-- JOHN McCAIN, FOREVER! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FREEDOM!
