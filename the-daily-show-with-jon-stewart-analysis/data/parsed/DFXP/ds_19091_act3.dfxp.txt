Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, PLEASE WELCOME GINA MCCARTHY! [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: COME AND SIT.
THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. FIRST OF ALL AS A BOSTONIAN, I SAY TO YOU CONGRATULATIONS ON A BEAUTIFUL MARATHON TODAY. BEAUTIFULLY DONE. VERY JOYOUS, REALLY LOVELY.
THANK YOU. BOSTON PROUD.
Jon: YES. REALLY WELL DONE. [ APPLAUSE ]
BOSTON STRONG.
Jon: IT WAS EXCELLENT. I WAS GOING TO RUN IN IT, BUT THEN I REMEMBERED I AM DECREPIT.
I KNEW THAT BEFORE THE RACE STARTED
Jon: YOU ARE VERY KIND. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE NEW POSITION?
OH, JUST ABOUT SIX, SEVEN MONTHS.
Jon: AND ARE WE CLEAN YET?  THE HAIR, THE WATER?
HUGE, HUGE MOVEMENT FORWARD SINCE I STARTED, YES.
Jon: TREMENDOUS.
YES.
Jon: WHAT IS FOR YOU STEPPING IN WHAT IS YOUR PRIORITY?
WELL, I SHARE THE PRESIDENT'S PRIORITY OF DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, FIRST AND FOREMOST.
Jon: NOW, SEE, THAT IS THE FIRST PART OF THAT ISSUE GETTING OVER HALF THE CONGRESS TO ADMIT THAT IT IS HAPPENING?
ACTUALLY, WE TRIED THAT FIRST.
Jon: HOW DID THAT GO?
NOT WELL, NOT WELL. NOT WELL. ACTUALLY, THE PRESIDENT, WHAT IS GREAT EVEN BEFORE I STARTED THE JOB HE PUT OUT A CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND WHAT HE SAID WAS THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO TAKE ACTION, WE ARE NOT WAITING FOR CLIMATE. HE SAW IT AS PART OF THE LEADERSHIP THE PRESIDENT HAS TO BRING TO THE COUNTRY AND HE ALSO IS LOOKING AT I THINK AS A FATHER OF TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AND HE STOOD UP AND SAID IT IS A MORAL OBLIGATION. I AGREE WITH HIM. WE HAVE GOT TO FIGHT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.
Jon: BUT WHAT WOULD -- WHAT WOULD DO IT?  YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. IF YOU TALKED TO THE FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES THEY WOULD SAY, ANY TYPE OF RESTRICTION ON WHAT THEY DO WOULD LEAD US TO AN ECONOMIC APOCALYPSE. IF YOU TALKED TO THE SCIENTISTS THEY SAY BY NOT DOING IT WE WILL HAVE A CLIMATE APOCALYPSE. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS, WHICH APOCALYPSE SHOULD I PREPARE FOR? BECAUSE I AM CLEARLY TRAPPED BETWEEN TWO APOCALYPSES.
IT'S A TOUGH CHOICE. WELL, I THINK THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE HISTORY. EPA HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 40 YEARS AND WE'VE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO AVOID APOCALYPSES. WE'VE CLEANED UP THE AIR, 70 PERCENT IN OUR AIR POLLUTION WHILE WE DOUBLED THE GDP, SO IT CAN BE DONE AND WITH CLIMATE WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD IN A COMMON SENSE WAY. LOTS ARE DOING IT THOUGH. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID IN HIS LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE RULE --
Jon: OH, THAT'S ALL I DO IS SIT LOOKING AT WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID IN HIS WHATEVER THAT THING IS.
YOU SHOULD. I'M SURE YOU DRIVE AROUND IN FUEL EFFICIENT CARS.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I AM DOING. I HAVE WHAT YOU CALL A NESTING HUMMER. A HUMMER INSIDE A HUMMER INSIDE A HUMMER.
SOUNDS RUSSIAN.
Jon: IT IS!  IT IS!
IT MIGHT NOT BE RUSSIANS, THOUGH.
Jon: IT'S TRUE.
HE DOUBLED THE FUEL ECONOMY BY 20-25, THAT LOWERED SIGNIFICANTLY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM MOBILE SOURCES AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU WILL GET MORE FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES AND THE CAR COMPANIES DIDN'T DIE.
Jon: BUT WE ARE A FOSSIL FUEL ECONOMY. I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY QUESTION WE ARE A FOSSIL FUEL ECONOMY.  AND ALL OF THESE REGULATIONS PUT THE MOM AND POP OIL COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS. THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAD YOUR DRUTHERS, LET'S SAY YOU GUYS, IT WASN'T POLITICAL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO CONVINCE HALF THE CONGRESS THIS IS REAL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
I DON'T THINK WE DO HAVE TO CONVINCE THEM IT IS REAL.  I MEAN, THE SCIENTISTS TELL US IT IS REAL. WHAT WE ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO IS TAKE COMMON SENSE STEPS IN MOVING FORWARD. ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE DOING IN JUNE IS WE ARE DOING A CARBON POLLUTION STANDARD FOR POWER PLANTS.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE POWER PLANTS ARE THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES.
Jon: IS THERE NO CARBON POLLUTION STANDARD FOR THEM PRESENTLY.
THERE ISN'T. THERE'S A STANDARD ON MOST OTHER POLLUTION, BUT THERE IS NOT A STANDARD ON CARBON, AND WE THINK CARBON IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS MERCURY AND NOX AND SULFUR AND SO WE ARE GOING TO GO FOR IT.
Jon: WHAT IS THE OUTPUT NOW AND WHAT IS THE STANDARD YOU WOULD LIKE IT TO BE? WHAT IS THE DIFFERENTIAL? JUST BECAUSE, AND I AM JUST SPEAKING FOR A FRIEND, IT IS NOT LIKE I BURN THINGS IN MY BACKYARD. I AM JUST CURIOUS, HOW MUCH IS THERE NOW AND HOW MUCH ARE WE LOOKING AT?
WE ARE GOING TO REGULATE IT UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT AND IT TELLS US WE HAVE TO TAKE STEPS FORWARD TO REDUCE IT. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT FLEXIBLE, YOU ARE GOING TO GET SOME SIGNIFICANT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS OUT OF IT. REALLY YOU CAN DO THIS. STATES AND COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN REDUCING THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FOR A LONG TIME. WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT TAKING ANY FUEL OUT OF THE SYSTEM.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MAKING THINGS MORE EFFICIENT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN EFFICIENCY. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RENEWABLE ENERGY AND TALKING ABOUT A FUTURE THAT IS ACTUALLY LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.
Jon: BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE MUCH MORE OF A WINNING ARGUMENT. THIS IS ABOUT EFFICIENCY AND ABOUT CREATING ENERGY IN A BETTER WAY BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU SAY TO THESE COMPANIES WE DON'T WANT TO POLLUTE WITH CARBON THEY WILL SAY WHAT ABOUT, WHAT ABOUT CHINA'S ECONOMY?  WHAT ABOUT INDIA'S ECONOMY?  WHAT ABOUT THESE GROWING, YOU KNOW, WE GOT OURS IN THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, WHAT ABOUT THESE COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOW BUILDING THEIR MIDDLE CLASSES AND WHAT ABOUT STATES LIKE TEXAS THAT DON'T LISTEN?
ACTUALLY -- [LAUGHTER.]
WE ARE ACTUALLY NOT TALKING ABOUT GOING BACKWARDS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT POSITIONING THE U.S. FOR THE FUTURE, AS WELL AS THOSE COMPANIES. THEY KNOW THEY CAN INVEST IN RENEWABLE ENERGY AND KNOW THEY CAN MAKE IT WORK IN AN ENERGY MIX AND SO OUR JOB REALLY IS TO TRY TO DRIVE THOSE REDUCTIONS NATIONALLY BUT TO MAKE SURE EVERY STATE IS DIFFERENTLY POSITIONED. SOME HAVE ALREADY DONE REALLY AGGRESSIVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY WORK AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY CAN DO A WHOLE LOT MORE.
Jon: BUT HOW MUCH IS THE POLITICS OF IT, EVEN WITH THE BOILER RULES THEY HAD, THEY MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT WOULD SAVE 6,000 LIVES --
YOU KNEW BOILER RULE AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE?
Jon: I KNEW BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY IF THEY STEP IN. AND IT IS A THING I DO, OH, LOOK AT ME. THE BOILER RULE YOU SAVE 6,000 LIVES THEY COME UP WITH A STANDARD, WHAT IS IT IN FEBRUARY 2011 BUT THEY DON'T IMPLEMENT IT UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION, WASHINGTON POST WRITES AN ARTICLE THIS IS POLITICAL PRESSURE, THEY SAY, I MEAN, HOW MUCH OF THAT IS REAL?
THE TIMELINE IN THE RULE IS SET IN STATUTE.
Jon: I MEAN WHEN IT GETS IMPLEMENTED. I KNOW IT IS IN THE STATUTE.
THAT IS WHAT IS IN THE STATUTE IS WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO NONE OF THIS IS FOLLOWING POLITICS.
Jon: I SEE.
IT IS FOLLOWING, I HOPE AND I THINK, WHAT IS BEST FOR AMERICA. AND IF WE DON'T START DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IS THE BIGGEST PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE, AS WELL AS THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC CHALLENGE WE FACE, AND THINK OF IT BOTH FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT, THEN I THINK WE ARE LOSING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION AND OUR OWN, FRANKLY. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: WELL, I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND NEXT YEAR, ME AND YOU, WE RUN THE MARATHON, YES?
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE, I APPRECIATE IT. GINA MCCARTHY. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
