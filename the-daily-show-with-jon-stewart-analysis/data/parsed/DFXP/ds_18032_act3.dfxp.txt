(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS 2012  CY YOUNG AWARD WINNER. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "WHEREVER  I WIND UP" AND HE'S THE SUBJECT  IN THE DOCUMENTARY FILM "KNUCKLEBALL."
YOU'RE CONSIDERED A FLUKE IS  BASICALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO. I WANT TO COMBAT THAT BECAUSE I  THINK IT'S A VERY VALID PITCH.
R.A. IS COMMITTED TO PROVING  THAT IT'S NOT A GIMMICK. THAT IT'S-- TO USE ONE OF HIS  FAVORITE WORDS-- AUTHENTIC. AND I THINK HE'S REALLY ON A  MISSION TO PROVE THE LEGITIMACY  OF THE KNUCKLEBALL.
Jon: SWEET! PLEASE WELCOME R.A. DICKIE  DICKEY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. (APPLAUSE)  WHAT A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU ON  THE SHOW. CONGRATULATIONS. THE CY YOUNG AWARD, NEW YORK  OBVIOUSLY EMBRACES --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THIS TREMENDOUS STORY, THIS TREMENDOUS SUCCESS I GUESS MY  QUESTION IS "HOW WILL THE NEW  YORK METS SCREW THIS UP?" (LAUGHTER)
I'M HOPING TO BE HERE, MAN. I WILL HAVE IT HERE.
Jon: THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE. WE WOULD ENJOY THAT. (APPLAUSE)  IT DOES CREATE A DILEMMA BECAUSE  WHEN A PLAYER SUCH AS YOURSELF  COMES ALONG AND HAS SUCH GRAND SUCCESS THERE IS IN THE BACK OF  YOUR MIND A FEELING OF, LIKE, NO  NO, DUDE, DON'T WIN THE CY YOUNG BECAUSE IF YOU DO THEY WILL SELL  YOU ON THE OPEN MARKET. (LAUGHTER)  YOU WANT TO BE GOOD BUT NOT SO  GREAT.
WELL, I'VE BEEN THANKFUL, I  DIDN'T HAVE THAT THOUGHT. I WAS GOING FOR IT THE WHOLE  TIME. BUT HE'S GOT A JOB TO DO, HE'S  PAID TO MAKE THE METS BETTER. I'VE GOT TO BE AS PROFESSIONAL I  CAN, UNDERSTAND THAT.
Jon: IT MUST BE TREMENDOUS  PRESSURE TO HAVE YOUR NAME BEING  WRITTEN ABOUT AS SOMEONE WHO MAY HAVE TO MOVE. YOU'VE GOT A FAMILY, YOU'VE GOT  A LIFE. IS THAT A DIFFICULT THING TO --
IT'S HARD. BASEBALL IN GENERAL IS SO  DYSFUNCTIONAL AS A LIFE-STYLE. YOU PLAY IN 162 GAMES IN 183  DAYS AND NOT TO MENTION SPRING  TRAINING IS ANOTHER 40 DAYS. SO THE THOUGHT OF TAKING YOUR  FAMILY TO TORONTO OR L.A., THAT  TAKES A LOT OF THOUGHT POWER, YOU KNOW?
Jon: I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT'S  STRANGE. YOU'RE A GROWN MAN WITH  PINSTRIPES AND GUYS ARE THROWING  THINGS AT 100 MILES AN HOUR AT YOUR HEAD AND YOU JUST -- WHAT  IS THE DOWN TIME IN THESE  CITIES? ESPECIALLY FOR A PITCHER?
WELL, IF WE ARE A THREE-GAME  SET AGAINST THE NATIONALS IN  WASHINGTON, IT'S A GREAT CITY, SO I MIGHT GO SEE A MUSEUM OR  I'LL TRY TO EXPLORE THE CULTURE  OF THE CITY. IF I'M NOT PITCHING THAT DAY. BUT YOU'RE AT THE PARK FOR A  7:00 GAME, I'M NEVER AT THE PARK  ANY LATER THAN 2:30. I MEAN, I'M TRYING TO PREPARE  FOR WHAT I HAVE TO DO IN A  COUPLE DAYS.
Jon: DO A LOT OF GUYS GO OUT  AND SEE THE MUSEUMS OR --  (LAUGHTER)  WHEN YOU COME BACK ARE THEY ALL LIKE "HEY, POINDEXTER, WHAT'S  GOING ON?"  (LAUGHTER)
THEY RESPECT THEIR ELDERS,  IT'S OKAY.
Jon: THAT'S AN INTERESTING  POINT. SO HERE'S WHAT'S ON -- IT'S  INCREDIBLE ENOUGH THAT A NEW  YORK METS PITCHER WINS 20 GAMES WHICH HASN'T BEEN DONE SINCE  FRANK VIOLA IN 1980 SOMETHING. YOU WON THE CY YOUNG AWARD BUT  YOU DID IT AT YOU'RE 38 YEARS  OLD MASTERING A PITCH THAT SO FEW PITCHERS CAN MASTER THEY'VE  MADE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE  MAYBE SIX OR SEVEN OF YOU THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PITCH  PROFESSIONALLY AT THAT LEVEL  WITH THAT PITCH.
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, MY  CAREER HAS BEEN CIRCUITOUS AND  THE WAY I'VE GOTTEN TO THE BIG LESION SO IT'S ALMOST POETIC THE  WAY THAT I'VE EMBRACED THE  KNUCKLEBALL AND MY CAREER TRAJECTORY HAS BEEN ALMOST  KNUCKLEBALLISH.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT'S NICE TO BE AT A PEAK, I  CAN TELL YOU.
Jon: THE OTHER KNUCKLEBALLERS  IN THE FRATERNITY, WHEN THEY SAW  YOU ARRIVE ON THE SCENE HOW DID THEY SHOW THEMSELVES? DO YOU GET A CALL AND DOES A GUY  STAND WITH A RAINCOAT LIKE "FILE  THOSE NAILS, KID, FILE THOSE NAILS."  HOW DO THEY REACH OUT TO YOU?
YOU KNOW, I REACHED OUT TO  THEM. THE KNUCKLEBALL FRATERNITY IS SO  TIGHT AND THE BOND IS TO SO  STRONG BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING AS THROW  A KNUCKLEBALL THERE'S ONLY A FEW  PEOPLE THAT HAVE WALKED THE EARTH THAT HAVE DONE WHAT YOU'RE  TRYING TO DO. SO I WAS SO FORTUNATE TO BE  EXPOSE POD-TO-WHAT I CALL THE  J.D. DI COUNCIL OF  KNUCKLEBALLERS. (LAUGHTER)  I HAVE TIM WAKEFIELD AND CHARLIE  HUFF AND PHIL NIEKRO.
Jon: CAN CURVE GUYS GET IN  THERE OR WHEN THEY COME ARE  PEOPLE LIKE "YEAH, THAT'S GREAT, SONNY?"  IS THAT NOT CONSIDERED THE PURE  PITCH.
IT'S A DIFFERENT PITCH ALL  TOGETHER. IT'S NOT EVEN THE SAME CATEGORY,  REALLY. I'M TRYING TO TAKE SPIN  COMPLETELY OFF THE BALL. WITH THE KNUCKLE CURVE YOU'RE  STILL TRYING TO MANIPULATE THE  SPIN TO GET THE BREAK THAT YOU  WANT. BUT THE KNUCKLEBALL YOU'RE  TAKING IT OFF IN HOPES THAT THE  CHAOS OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE PITCH IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO  UPSET THEIR TIMING AND RHYTHM OF  THE HITTER.
Jon: AND YOU THROW IT TEN TO  15 MILES AN HOUR HARDER THAN  ANYBODY ELSE HAS THROWN IT. YOU'RE THROWING IN THE 80s, YES? THERE ARE MAJOR LEAGUE PITCHERS  THROWING THEIR REGULAR STUFF IN  THE 80s, YOU'RE THROWING KNUCKLEBALLS IN THE -- IS THAT  WHAT MAKES YOURS SO DIFFICULT ON  THESE HITTERS?
MOST GUYS THROWING IN THE 80s  AREN'T THROWING VERY LONG,  UNFORTUNATELY. THAT'S WHY I BECAME A  KNUCKLEBALLER BECAUSE I HAD --  MY CONVENTIONAL REPERTOIRE HAD DEPLETED TO THE POINT WHERE IF I  WAS GOING TO STAY A BIG-LEAGUER  I HAD TO COME UP WITH A WEAPON I COULD GET GUYS OUT WITH. THE KNUCKLEBALL WAS MY TICKET.
Jon: YOU DON'T HAVE LIKE --  YOU'RE MISSING LIGAMENTS IN YOUR  ELBOW AND YOU DON'T HAVE -- THERE'S NO BONE THERE, IT'S JUST  -- YOU JUST FLOP IT AROUND? SOMETHING GOING ON IN THERE --
I'M PLASTIC MAN. I CAN -- I HAVE'VE GOT NO  LIGAMENT IN MY RIGHT ELBOW. SO THAT COUPLED WITH BEING A  KNUCKLEBALLER I SHOULD BE ABLE  TO PITCH UNTIL I'M 70 OR 80,  PROBABLY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: AUDIENCE LIKES THAT, CAN  YOU STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE  BIT?
SURE.
Jon: "KNUCKLEBALL" THE D.V.D. IS AVAILABLE THROUGH ITUNES. YOU CAN GET THE BOOK "WHEREVER I  WIND UP" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES  NOW. R.A. DICKEY, WE'RE GOING TO TALK  A L
