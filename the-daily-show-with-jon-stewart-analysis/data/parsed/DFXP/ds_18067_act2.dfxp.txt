Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. CONTINUING OUR COVERAGE OF THE  WAR ON PURIM -- [LAUGHTER] WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON. WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY IS  PERHAPS THE WORLD'S MOST  PRESTIGIOUS (bleep) JOB. YOU BAWRVEGLY FUNCTION AS A  HUMAN SHIELD AGAINST WHAT WE ON  EARTH CALL WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON. CONSIDER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU  ARE READY TO HANG UP THE MIC. EXPRESIDENTS GET BIG SPEAKING  FEES OR CARP PEN TRI WORK OR  THEY CAN ROB BANKS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHERE DOES ONE WHOSE ENTIRE JOB  CONSIFTING OF DISSEMBLING TO THE  PRESS GO?
I WANT TO BRING UP ROBERT  GIBBS, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY OF  THE WHITE HOUSE.
Jon: YOU GO TO THE CLASS. HE HAS EARNED HIS MSNBC OFFICIAL  RETRO FRAMED ANALOGLASSES. YOU KNOW WHO WEARS WIRE RIMS,  WAIT. GIBBS HAS BEEN FUNCTIONING AS AN  ADMINISTRATION MOUTH PIECE AND  NOW HE'S FLIPPING. CAN WE TRUST HIM? MR. GIBBS WHEN YOU WERE WORKING  AS PRESS SECRETARY YOU ANSWERS  QUESTIONS ABOUT DRONES THUSLY.
I DON'T THINK U.S. OFFICIALS  HAVE CONFIRMED THE PREDATOR  DRONE AIR STRIKES.
I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO  THESE MATTERS.
DRONE STRIKES KILLED EIGHT  GERMANS IN PAKISTAN TODAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION  ABOUT THAT?
I DON'T. AND IF I DID -- IF I DID, I  WOULDN'T GET INTO IT.
Jon: SHIRE TIP FOR YOU  ASPIRING TRUTH SLEUTHS OUT THERE  IF SOMEBODY SAYS I DON'T FOE ABOUT THAT, AND EVEN IF I DID, I  WOULDN'T TELL YOU, THAT PERSON  KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. THIS GUY IS GOING TO HAVE TO  PROVE TO US HIS CHANGES HIS  INFORMATION HIDES WAYS DUSM KNOW ABOUT THAT?
WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE  PROCESS OF BECOMING PRESS  SECRETARY ONE OF FIRST THINGS THEY TOLD ME IS THAT YOU ARE NOT  EVEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DRONE  PROGRAM. YOU ARE NOT EVEN TO DISCUSS IT  EXISTS.
Jon: THE SECOND THING THEY  TOLD ME HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF  INTERIOR INVENTED AIDS. TURNS OUT IT'S THE NEW FORMULA  OF NEW COKE INSTEAD OF HIGH  FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. YOU COPPED TO LYING ALL THAT IS  LEFT NOW IS TO DISTANCE YOURSELF  TO THE LYING.
OUR DISMISSAL OF PROGRAM  UNDERMINES PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE  OVERALL IN THE DECISIONS THE GOVERNMENT MAKES.
Stephen: --
Jon: I TOLD THEM ALL THE  TIMER UNDERMINING -- AND THEY  WOULD SAY GIBBS TRY THIS MONKEY  POP. DID YOU IT BOTHER YOU, MR. GIBBS.
HERE IS WHAT IS CRAZY ABOUT  THAT PROPOSITION. YOU ARE ASKED A QUESTION BASED  ON REPORTING OF A PROGRAM THAT  EXISTS. RIGHT, SO, YOU ARE THE OFFICIAL  GOVERNMENT SPOKESPERSON.
EXACTLY.
ACTING AS IF THE ENTIRE  PROGRAM PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE  MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN.
Jon: WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO  QUIT? GET ANOTHER IN THE OBAMA  ECONOMY. COME ON, I TOLD YOU AT THE TIME  THINGS WERE LOOKING UP FOR THE  ECONOMY BUT I WAS (bleep) ON THAT, TOO. HE GIVES HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE  PRESS SECRETARY JOB AND ARE  NEVER THE SAME.
I WENT INTO THIS VERY MUCH  BELIEVING THE PRESIDENT WAS  COMMITTED TO BE A BIPARTISAN  LEADER. I WAS DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY IN  THE BUILDUP TO THE WAR. LIKE A LOT OF AMERICANS I WASN'T  CERTAIN ABOUT THE RUSH TO WAR. I WAS BECOME MORE DISILLUSIONED. WHEN I LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE I  NEEDED TIME TO TAKE OFF THE  PARTISAN HAT AND I WANTED TO THINK THROUGH WHY DID THINGS GET  SO BADLY OFF TRACK?
Jon: ARE YOU HAPPY? YOU ARE BROKEN. YOU KNOW, IF I'M PRESIDENT I  DON'T WANT EITHER A GIBBS SHALL  GIBBS A JADED PRESENCE KNOWINGLY SPILL YOUR SECRETS ONCE HE  LEAVES OFFICE OR McCLELLAN A  FORMER BELIEVER WHO IN CLEANSING HIS SOUL SPILLS YOUR SECRETS. WHEN YOU NEED IS A JADED  BELIEVER. OH. [ LAUGHTER ] A BEING SO DIFFICULT AND STUB  BORN THEY SAY IT TOOK THREE  FOLLOW-UPS TO GET HIM TO TELL YOU WHAT HE WANTED FOR LUNCH. THERE'S FLEISCHER BACK IN THE  DAY.
THERE'S NO QUESTION WE HAVE  EVIDENCE THAT IRAQ HAS WEAPONS  OF MASS DESTRUCTION. THE UNITED NATIONS HAVE SAID  THEY DID. IRAQ SAYS THEY DON'T. YOU CAN CHOOSE WHO YOU WANT TO  BELIEVE.
Jon: COLD! HERE IS FLEISCHER NOW. SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT THE CHANGE.
THE REPORT SAYS THERE'S TIES  TO AL QAEDA. TO SAY THAT PRESIDENT BUSH LIED  ABOUT THIS, PAUL, THAT IS  EXACTLY THE TYPE OF DIVISIVENESS WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE BEYOND IN  THIS COUNTRY. BARACK OBAMA SHOULD SAY THANK  YOU EVERY DAY THAT INHERITED A  WORLD WITHOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN IN  IT.
Jon: DID YOU CATCH THE  CHANGE? HE DOESN'T WEAR GLASSES ANYMORE. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, YEAH HIS EYESIGHT HAS  IMPROVED. THE LONGER HE LIVES WITH THE  SPIN THE STRONGER HE GETS. IF YOU WANT A PRESS SECRETARY,  THE MAN YOU NEED IS RIGHT HERE  BENJAMIN (bleep). WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
