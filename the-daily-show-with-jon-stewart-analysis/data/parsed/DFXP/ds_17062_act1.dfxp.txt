FEBRUARY 22, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, MILD-MANNERED ECONOMIST BRUCE BARTLETT. YOU KNOW HIM AS THE INCREDIBLE HULK. BRUCE BANNER. I APOLOGIZE. NOW DIONNE WARWICK IS VERYANGARY. FOLKS, TONIGHT IN ARIZONA AS WE SPEAK, BEFORE REMAINING REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATES MET IN THE PEN PENULTIMATE DEBATE OF THIS ELECTION SEASON, TONIGHT, TWO OF  THEM WERE CARD OFF BY BANDITOS ND ONE WAS SWALLOWED BY AOSA SNAKE. I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE. ( APPLAUSE ) ACTUALLY WE DO. I BELIEVE THAT'S CLEARLY NEWT GINGRICH'S HEAD. ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AT THE DEBATE WE TAPED BEFORE THE DEBATE. BUT I DO KNOW THIS-- NOTE MATTER WHAT ISSUES THEY DISCUSSED, WHETHER SATAN'S INFLUENCE ON THE DECARE OF OUR CULTURE, OR HOW SATAN RECENTLY JACKED THE PRICE  OF GAS UP, OR HOW SATAN DECIDED THIS WOULD BE THE LAST SEASON OF "CHUCK."  I ASSUMA THAT WAS SATAN BECAUSE WHO ELSE WOULD CANCEL "CHUCK."  THIS ELECTION OF 2012 IS ALL THAT STANDS BETWEEN AMERICA ANDICAA TAFT FEE, JUST AS WE  WERE WARNED, THE CONSEQUENCES IN 2008 COULD BE DIRE.
IF MR. OBAMA SHOULD BECOME PRESIDENTISH REALLY BELIEVE IT WILL BE HARD TO STOP THE ECONOMY  FROM BEING SOCIALIZED. >>SOCIALIZED.
Jon:  SOCIALIZED ECONOMY! IF OBAMA WAS ELECTED IN 2008. WE WERE WARNED. AND, INDEED, BARACK OBAMA DID TAKE BILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND REDISTRIBUTE THEM... TO THE BANKS. ( LAUGHTER ) SO IT'S KIND OF SOCIALISM, IN A DYSLEXIC... ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHAT OF OUR ENEMIES ABROAD?
I WILL TELL YOU IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, THEN THE RADICAL ISLAMISTS, THE AL QAEDA  AND THE RADICAL ISLAMISTS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS, WILL BE DANCING IN THE STREETS.
Jon:  TALK ABOUT-- TALK ABOUT HITTING THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. IF YOU WERE TO REPLACE THE WORD "DANCING" WITH THE PHRASE, "DONNELLING UNMANNED DRONE MISSILES RAINING HELL FIRE FROM THE SKY." SO TWO FOR TWO.   ( APPLAUSE )  AND BY THE WAY, IN 2008, THERE  WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING... ( LAUGHTER ) ALLAH WE DID WAS ADD A ( BLEEP ). IN 2008, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING YOU COULD DO TO DEFEND YOURSELF AGAINST THE SOCIALIST  ISLAMIST TAKEOVER BECAUSE THE DICTATOR HAD THOUGHT THINGS THROUGH.
IF EITHER SENATOR CLINTON OR SENATOR OBAMA IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, THE RIGHTS OF  LAW-ABIDING GUN OWNERS WILL BE AT RISK, MY FRIENDS, AND HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
Jon:  NO DOUBT ABOUT IT! ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHILE THE ONLY SECOND AMENDMENT MEASURES OBAMA ENDED  UP SIGNING ALLOWED CITIZENS TO CARRY CONCEALED WEAPONS INTO NATIONAL PARKS AND ON TO AMTRAK  TRAINS, WHICH MAKES SENSE-- ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE WHO BETTER TO BE ARMED THAN ANGRY LATE PEOPLE IN  CONFINED SPACES? THE POINT IS, EVEN THOUGH OBAMA HAS NOT TAKEN YOUR GUNS, IN HINDSIGHT, THERE IS NO DOUBT  THAT HE HAS... ( LAUGHTER ) SEE, IT APPEARS BARACK OBAMA HAS FAILED TO KEEP MANY OF THE CAMPAIGN PROMISES THAT HIS  OPPONENTS MADE FOR HIM. ( LAUGHTER ) INCLUDING, THE INCREDIBLY SPECIFIC ONES--
HE'S GOING TO HAVE AN EFFORT TO ELIMINATE FREEDOM OF SPEECH  FOR RUSH LIMBAUGH AND SEAN HANNITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  IT'S A SHAME THAT NEWT GINGRICH NEVER GOT TO LIVE TO SEE THAT DREAM REALIZED  BECAUSE AS WE SAID TONIGHT, IN ARIZONA, NEWT GINGRICH SWALLOWED WHOLE BY WHAT ANY OBSERVER WOULD  CONSIDER TO BE A VERY AMBESHES SNAKE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) TRAGEDY, REALLY. BUT BY NOW, WE'VE PRETTY MUCH SEEN-- THAT WAS ALL IN 2008. A LOT OF FEAR MONGERING, A LOT OF DOOMS SAYERS BUT BY NOW WE'VE  PRETTY MUCH SEEN OBAMA'S FIRST TERM. IT LOOKS LIKE CONSERVATIVES GOT A LITTLE BIT KICKED IN THE CRYSTAL BALLS BY THIS ONE. YOU MIGHT NOT BE THRILLED WITH OBAMA'S RESULTS, BUT, CLEARLY, IT'S NOT BEEN THE CITIZEN-DISARMING AL QAEDA-CODDLING-LIMBAUGH- MUZZL  AL QAEDA-CODDLING-LIMBAUGH-MUZZL INGICA TAFT-( BLEEP ) THAT THE REPUBLICAN SOOTHSAYERS WERE  PREDICTING IN 2008. WHAT DO YOU DO IN 2012? WHAT WILL BE THE REPUBLICANS' RHETORICAL STRATEGY THIS TIME AROUND?
HE WILL WAGE WAR ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH THE MORNING AFTER HE'S RE-ELECTED. ( LAUGHTER ). ( APPLAUSE ) YES, NOVEMBER 3, 2012, RIGHT AFTER THE PRESIDENT-ELECT ENJOYS  A VICTORY OMLET, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL BE ATTACKED.
IF BARACK OBAMA GETS RE-ELECTED IT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
IF PRESIDENT OBAMA IS RE-ELECTED, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET A JOB.
WE SIMPLY WILL STEP INTO THIS UM AIRARRAIAN NIGHT OF EUROPEANS SOCIALISM.
AMERICA WILL NOT BE THE LAND THAT BELIEVES IN FREE PEOPLE AND PRIX ENTERPRISE.
IF WE RE-ELECT BARACK OBAMA, IRAN WILL HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
THERE IS NO FUTURE, THERE IS NO HOPE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA HAVING A SECOND TERM.
YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD, EVERYBODY! YOU, YOU'RE DEAD, ALREADY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  I THINK THAT LAST ONE WOULD BE A GREAT CANDIDATE TO PUT UP AGAINST MITT ROMNEY. YOU ALL HAVE LOST YOUR DAMN MINDS! IF OBAMA HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO PULL ANY OF ( BLEEP ) OFF AFTER THREE YEARS OF HIS ACTUAL  PRESIDENCY, WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S WAITING FOR?
IMAGINE A SECOND TERM IF HE DOESN'T HAVE TO FACE REELECTION.
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW RADICAL HE'LL BE IN HIS SECOND TERM.
WE SEE THE PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY CRYSTAL CLEAR-- GET RE-ELECTED, AND WITH NO MORE  ELECTIONS TO WORRY ABOUT, GET BUSY DISMANTLING AND DESTROYING OUR FIREARMS FREEDOM. IT'S ALL PART OF A MASSIVE OBAMA CONSPIRACY TO DECEIVE VOTERS AND HIDE HIS TRUE INTENTIONS TO  DESTROY THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
Jon:  SO THE WHOLE FIRST TERM IS JUST LAYING THE TRAP. ( LAUGHTER ). IT'S A LONG CON. EVERYBODY OBAMA HAS DONE IN HIS FIRST TERM IS JUST A CUNARD SO HE CAN DO THE OPPOSITE IN HIS  SECOND TERM? ( LAUGHTER ) OBAMA DEPORTED MORE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS PER YEAR THAN PRESIDENT BUSH DID, SO THAT THE  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COULD REST UP IN THEIR NATIVE LAND FOR THE SECOND TERM INVASION? ( LAUGHTER ) BARACK OBAMA KILLED BIN LADEN AND DUMPED HIS BODY INTO THE OCEAN TO LULL US INTO  COMPLACENCY SO WE'RE UNAWARE THAT A ZOMBIE BIN LADEN IS NOW HARD AT WORK ON THE OCEAN FLOOR  PREPARING AA TERRORIST LOBSTER ARMY? ( LAUGHTER ) THAT WILL USE YOUR CONFISCATED WEAPONS TO TAKE DOWN THE VATICAN ON NOVEMBER 3? ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S ONLY ONE SAFE PLACE, PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) THE BELLY OF THE SNAKE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
