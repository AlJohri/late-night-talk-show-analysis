Jon: ON NOVEMBER 6,  AMERICANS WILL GO TO THE POLLS  TO CHOOSE EITHER BARACK OBAMA OR  MILTON ROMNEY AS OUR NEXT  PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER)  BUT WHAT IF-- WHAT IF-- IT HAD  BEEN CAIN? (LAUGHTER)  JOHN OLIVER HAS MORE IN THIS  CONTINUING SERIES.
IN OCTOBER OF 2011, HERMAN  CAIN LED THE POLLS FOR THE  REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL  NOMINATION. TRAGICALLY, AMERICA WAS DENIED A  HERMAN CAIN PRESIDENCY, BUT  RECENTLY I SAT DOWN WITH  MR. CAIN FOR A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS TO EXPLORE SOME OF  THE TOUGH DECISIONS HE WOULD  HAVE FACED IN OFFICE. TONIGHT, CHINA.
WE CURRENTLY OWE CHINA  APPROXIMATELY $1.5 TRILLION.
HOLY (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)
YES, THAT'S A PROBLEM. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD NOT  ONLY BE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS  AMOUNT OF DEBT, THEY SHOULD BE  FRIGHTENED BECAUSE OF THIS AMOUNT OF DEBT.
THEY SHOULD BE BAT (BLEEP)  TERRIFIED.
ABSOLUTELY B.S. TERRIFIED.
SHOULD WE AT LEAST BE  LEARNING CHINESE AT THIS POINT,  MR. PRESIDENT? TRY THIS, NI HOA.
YOU MIGHT OFFEND THEM IF YOU  ONLY NO ONE WORD.
WELL, TRY THIS ONE. (SPEAKING CHINESE)
(SPEAKING CHINESE)  NOW WHAT IS THAT?
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT CHINESE,  THAT'S JUST SOME NOISES THAT  SOUND LIKE CHINESE BUT THE POINT IS IF WE START LEARNING THOSE  FIRST THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY GET US  SOMEWHERE.
I DON'T THINK THEY CARE IF WE  LEARN CHINESE OR NOT. THEY ONLY CARE IF WE ARE ABLE TO  PAY BACK THE DEBT THAT WE OWE  THEM.
THE CRISIS. MR. PRESIDENT, CHINA IS  DEMANDING THAT THE U.S. PAY BACK  ITS DEBT IN FULL IMMEDIATELY. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL BRING ON  FINANCIAL APOCALYPSE. YOU NEED TO LOOK INTO THAT  CAMERA AND CONVINCE THE PEOPLE  OF CHINA THAT WE ARE GOOD TO PAY  BACK THAT DEBT. (LAUGHTER)
WHY YOU GOTTA PLAY ME LIKE  THAT, CHINA? (LAUGHTER)  WHEN YOU LOANED THAT MONEY TO MY  PREDECESSORS DID YOU REALLY  THINK YOU WERE GOING TO GET IT  BACK? I WILL PAY YOU BACK BECAUSE I'M  A MAN OF HONOR.
Jon:.
CHINA'S NOT BUDGETING BUT WE  HAVE JUST HAD THE RESULTS BACK  FROM YOUR LATEST PRESIDENTIAL  PHYSICAL AND IT TURNS OUT YOU HAVE TELEPATHIC POWERS. LOOK INTO THAT CAMERA AND  CONVINCE THE CHINESE THAT THEY  NEED TO STEP DOWN. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S YOUR MOVE.
Jon: NEXT TIME ON "HERMAN  CAIN, AN AMERICAN PRESIDENCY,"  SCIENCE.
HERMAN CAIN AIN'T NO CLONE. (LAUGHTER)
JOHN OLIVER, WE'LL BE RIGHT
