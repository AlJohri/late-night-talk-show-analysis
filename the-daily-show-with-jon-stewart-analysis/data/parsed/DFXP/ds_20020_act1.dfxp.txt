FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN, MAN DO WE HAVE A SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST JOURNALIST JAMES RISIN. HE'S SPILLING THE BEANS-- I HOPE HE'S ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. THEY COULD BE DRAGGING HIM AWAY RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW. WE SAW HIM IN THE GREEN ROOM, BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT SECURITY IS LIKE BACK THERE. FIRST, TUESDAY NIGHT, THE DEMOCRATS GOT TAKEN OUT BACK AND OLD-YELLLER'D BY THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE. ( LAUGHTER ) IF YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU SHOULD RENT IT. IT'S PRETTY GOOD UP UNTIL THAT PART. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS A MAJOR REPUDIATION, REPUDIATION OF THE PRESIDENT WHO, ACCORDING TO REPORTS, SPENT ELECTION NIGHT IN HIS SWEAT PANTS DROWNING HIS SORROWS IN PINT FORCE ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) THE NEXT DAY, THE PRESIDENT WENT BEFORE THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS TO CONFRONT THE WHY OF HIS DEFEAT.
"I'M A SINGLE MOM AND AT THE END OF THE MONTH IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO PAY THE BILLS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  THAT'S NOT WHY YOU LOST. ACTUALLY, THAT JOKE WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY CONTEXT, CONTEXT. LOOK AT HOW SILLY THE WORLD WOULD BE WITHOUT CONTEXT. ( LAUGHTER ) ACTUALLY, THE DAMAGE-- THE DAMAGE FROM THIS YEAR'S MIDTERMS PRETTY EASY TO CATALOG.
WELL, THIS MORNING, THE PARTY IS IN SHAMBLES.
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF SOUL-SEARCHING AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE STILL IN SORT OF STAGE THREE OF THE FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF.
Jon:  THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS NO MORE. IT HAS CEASED TO BE. IT'S SHUFFLED OFF THIS MORTAL COIL AND JOINED THE CHOIR INVISIBLE. SORRY, I HAVEN'T COME DOWN FROM JOHN CLEESE BEING ON THE SHOW YESTERDAY. WAIT A SECOND. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN SHAMBLES. A LOT OF SOUL-SEARCHING. STAGES OF GRIEF. WHY IS IT THOSE PHRASES ARE SO FAMILIAR?
THE LATEST SIGN OF A REPUBLICAN PARTY SIMPLY IN SHAMBLES.
FOR MORE REPUBLICAN SOUL SEARCHING IS NOW UNDER WAY IN THE WAKE OF THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE KIND OF GOING THROUGH THEIR FIVE STAGES OF OF GRIEF AFTER THE ELECTION.
Jon:  OH, RIGHT! OH! I KNOW WHY THOSE PHRASES ARE SO IN MY HEAD BECAUSE THEY SAID THE EXACT SAME ONES ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHEN ITS DEATH WARRANT WAS SIGNED IN 2012. A MERE 24 MONTHS, APPARENTLY, BEFORE IT BURST FORTH FROM ITS GRAVE LIKE JESUS CHRIST. OR A ZOMBIE, DEPENDING ON YOUR PERSONAL BELIEFS. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S AS THOUGH EVERY EVENT THAT HAPPENS IS VIEWED BY OUR MEDIA SINGULARLY AS THOUGH IT DIDN'T EXIST IN ANY PREVIOUS-- OH, WHAT'S THE WORD WE'RE LOOKING FOR? OH, RIGHT-- CONTEXT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S THE ( BLEEP ) YOU HAVE IN YOUR TAPE LIBRARY THAT GIVES SEEMINGLY ISOLATED INCIDENTS PERSPECTIVE. ( LAUGHTER ) REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY IS CURRENTLY GRIEVING, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET ALONG.
WE OUGHT TO SEE WHAT AREAS OF AGREEMENT THERE ARE AND SEE IF WE CAN MAKE SOME PROGRESS FOR THE COUNTRY.
I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO BE SPENDING A LOT MORE TIME WITH THEM NOW BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME STUFF DONE. AND I-- I TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD THAT THEY WANT TO PRODUCE.
Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SORRY, THAT-- THAT IS INSPIRING. TO SEE-- TWO LONG-TERM RIVALS COME TOGETHER. AFTER AN ELECTION AND UNITE AROUND A SHARED MESSAGE OF DISINGENUOUS ( BLEEP ). ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, OBVIOUSLY, THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO CHANGE. THIS WAS THEIR RELATIONSHIP LAST YEAR.
SOME FOLKS STILL DON'T THINK I SPEND ENOUGH TIME WITH CONGRESS. WHY DON'T YOU GET A DRINK WITH MITCH McCONNELL, THEY ASK. REALLY? ( LAUGHTER ) WHY DON'T YOU GET A DRINK WITH MITCH McCONNELL.
Jon:  BOOM! DROP THE MIC. WELL, THAT WAS THE OLD RELATIONSHIP. THIS IS THE RELATIONSHIP NOW.
ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE THAT DRINK CAN MITCH McCONNELL NOW YOU JOKED ABOUT AT THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER.
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I WOULD ENJOY HAVING SOME KENTUCKY BOURBON WITH MITCH McCONNELL.
Jon:  FIRST OF ALL, NO YOU WOULDN'T. ( LAUGHTER ) AND SECOND OF ALL, WE ALL KNOW SENATOR McCONNELL ISN'T A BOURBON FAN. HIS PREFERED DRINK IS AN ALGAE AND POND WATER COCKTAIL WITH A SOUCIANT OF MUD AND GARNISHED WITH A REFRESHING LEAF OF LETTUCE. NOW YOU KNOW, THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF CONTROVERSY THAT WE'VE BEEN LIKENING THE PRESUMPTIVE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL TO A SLOW-TALKING TORTOISE MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) I WANT TO-- I WANT TO STATE FOR THE RECORD WE ARE NOT. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS ASSERTING THAT MITCH McCONNELL IS LITERALLY, BIOLOGICALLY, A TORTOISE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SPECIFICALLY A 180-YEAR-OLD LIVING, BREATHING, GIANT TORTOISE OF THE SPECIES ALDABRACHELYS GIGANTEA WHO HAS, DESPITE NOT BEING INDIGENOUS TO NORTH AMERICA SOMEHOW ASCENDED TO A PROMINENT LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AND SO I SAY TO SENATOR McCONNELL, KUDOS. SO WITH BOTH -- THAT WAS A LONG RIDE, WASN'T IT? THAT WAS A LONG WALK. YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WERE GOING ON THAT. SO WITH BOTH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SENATOR McCONNELL GIVING LIP SERVICE TO ACTUALLY WORKING, MAYBE THERE CAN BE A TRUCE BETWEEN THESE TWO PARTIES.
MITCH McCONNELL AND JOHN BOEHNER, THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, THEY ARE CALLING FOR ANOTHER REPEAL OF OBAMACARE.
THE BATTLE OVER IMMIGRATION REFORM AS PRESIDENT OBAMA VOWS THAT HE WILL GET REFORM DONE WITH OR WITHOUT CONGRESS.
THE TEMPORARY TRUCE BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND CONGRESS LASTED LESS THAN 24 HOURS. ♪ IT IS THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF AQUARIUS ♪♪ ♪ AGE OF AQUARIUS ♪ ( LAUGHTER ) REALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT McCONNELL SAID YESTERDAY, IT WAS CLEAR THIS PARTNERSHIP WAS DOOMED FROM THE START.
THERE'S NO PERSONALITY PROBLEM HERE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I THINK MY ATTITUDE ABOUT ALL THIS AT THIS POINT IS TRUST, TRUST BUT VERIFY.
Jon:  TRUST BUT VERIFY. WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT BEFORE?
THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS TREATY TRANSCENDS NUMBERS-- TRUST BUT VERIFY.
Jon:  THERE YOU HAVE IT! THE HIGH-WATER MARK OF OUR MIEW ERA OF BIPARTISANSHIP IS THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER IMPLYING HE IS TO OBAMA AS REAGAN WAS TO THE LEADER OF OUR TOTALITARIAN NUCLEAR ARMED NEMESIS-- A.K.A., THE EVIL EMPIRE. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, MY FEELING OF DESPAIR IS BROUGHT TO ME BY HISTORICAL CONTEXT. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S WHY OLD PEOPLE ARE SAD. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
