Jon:  MY GUEST TONIGHT IS  THE FOUNDER THE "NEW YORK TIMES"  POLITICAL BLOG, PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, MR. NATE  SILVER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ♪ ♪ ♪  NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU, JON.
Jon:  SO, OBVIOUSLY, I  THINK WITH THE ELECTION RESULTS  LAST NIGHT, DO YOU WANT TO OFFER AN APOLOGY? ( LAUGHTER )
WE MISSED THE NORTH DAKOTA  SENATE RACE.
Jon:  YES, YOU DID! ( LAUGHTER )  YOU SAID THAT REPUBLICAN RICK  BURT WOULD WIN. HE LOST.
HE LOST.
Jon:  YOU BETTER GET OUT  OF THE BBUDDY. LAST NIGHT, HERE IS HONESTLY HOW  I FELT-- I DIDN'T KNOW OBAMA  WOULD WIN, ROMNEY WOULD WIN, THE COUNTRY WOULD SURVIVE EITHER. WHAT I WAS REALLY CONCERNED  ABOUT LAST NIGHT WAS THAT IF  YOUR PREDICTION MODEL HAD BEEN WRONG, THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A  DEFEAT FOR ARITHMETIC  ( LAUGHTER )  AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SEIZED UPON THAT TO, LIKE, I THINK THEN  GRAVITY WOULD BE UP FOR GRABS.
SURE.
Jon:  IS THAT HOW YOU  VIEWED IT, TO SOME EXTENT,  DISPASSIONATELY FOR MATH?
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD, I  THINK, BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON,  538 THAT CAME INVESTED WITH THIS SYMBOLIC POWER AND SYMBOLIC  POWER ISN'T PARTICULARLY  RATIONAL, BUT IT BECAME A SYMBOL FOR PEOPLE WHO WHO WERE  BELIEVING, LET'S LOOK AT THE  POLLS AND DO IMPEERICAL  RESEARCH.
Jon:  YOU WERE THE  CHICK-FILL-A--
WHEN I WENT TO THE DEMOCRATIC  CONVENTION IN CHARLOTTE. THERE WAS A CHICK-FILL-A --
Stephen:  IT'S SO GOOD.
IT'S PRETTY GOOD. I THINK YOU CAN SAMPLE IN THE  OTHER SIDE OF STUFF, RIGHT, AND  TRY AND COME AWAY MORE INFORMED FROM IT. BUT WHAT WAS SURPRISING TO ME IS  THAT BEFORE THE ELECTION YOU HAD  PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT JUST PREDICTING ROMNEY WILL EKE IT  OUT IN OHIO. IT'S REPUBLICAN LEANING, ET  CETERA. THEY WERE SAYING WE'D HAVE A  ROMNEY LANDSLIDE IN THE SWINGS  STATES. AND TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION  MEANS I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE  BIT OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY. AND YOU BETTER BE RIGHT. WE GET A TEST. WE GET A TEST AND IT'S THE GOOD  THING ABOUT MAKING A PREDICTION  OR FORECAST YOU'RE CALLED ON YOUR-- CAN I SAY ( BLEEP ) ON  TV?
Jon:  NOT ON THIS SHOW  YOU CAN'T. ON THIS PROGRAM I BELIEVE YOU  CAN ONLY SAY ( BLEEP ). ( LAUGHTER ). I BELIEVE. IF I'M CORRECT. BUT THAT IS-- WHAT SO STRUCK ME  IS I AM NOT PARTICULARLY VERSED  IN STATISTICS, BUT AS I READ YOUR BLOG, IT WAS BEING USED AS  A TOTEM FOR THE LEFT BECAUSE IT  WAS SO POSITIVE FOR OBAMA BUT THE UNDERPINNINGS OF IT WERE  THESE POLLS STATISTICALLY WOULD  NOT ALL HAVE THE SAME MARGIN OF ERROR IN THE SAME DISTRIBUTION.
RIGHT.
Jon:  IF IT WERE NOT  STATISTICALLY PROVABLE IT WAS  MOVING IN THAT PROTECTION.
YEAH, UNLESS THERE WERE SOME  BIAS IN THE POLLS. IF ANYTHING THE POLLS WERE A  LITTLE LOW ON SOME STATES FOR  OBAMA. AND THAT SOME OF THE THEM  UNDERESTIMATED THE NUMBER OF  MINORITIES THAT MIGHT TURN OUT, FOR EXAMPLE, AS WELL. BUT THE POLLS ARE A PRETTY GOOD  TRACK RECORD. LIKE IN NORTH DAKOTA, THEY'RE  NOT PERFECT, NECESSARILY. BUT THAT'S --
Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW HOW  YOU GO OUTSIDE AFTER THAT NORTH  DAKOTA THING. ( LAUGHTER ). DO YOU THINK-- LET ME ASK YOU  THIS ABOUT THE ELECTORAL  COLLEGE. IS THERE ANY WAY TO DETERMINE  HOW ELECTIONS WOULD BE CHANGED  BY A SWITCH FROM THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE TO THE POPULAR VOTE? I KNOW STRATEGICALLY THINGS  WOULD CHANGE A LITTLE BIT, BUT  DO YOU THINK OUTCOMES WOULD BE DEMONSTRABLY DIFFERENT?
I THINK A LITTLE BIT, MAYBE. IRONICALLY IT ALMOST PLAYS TO  DEMOCRATS' BENEFIT WHERE YOU  BUILD A CONSTITUENT AND COBBLE TOGETHER THE 51% MAJORITY  INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE BIG GROUP  WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF DEPTH. ROMNEY WILL WIN SOUTH DAKOTA AND  TENNESSEE AND ALABAMA AND STATE  LIKE THAT, BY 20 OR 25 POINTS. WHEREAS THERE ARE ALL THESE  STATES WHERE DEMOCRATS WON BY  ONE OR TWO OR THREE OR FOUR OUR FIVE POINTS AND IT LOOKS LIKE  THEY MAY HAVE A BIT OF AN  ADVANTAGE RIGHT NOW. IF I WERE A G.O.P. STRATEGIST, I  WOULD BE TERRIFIED BY FLORIDA,  EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT OFFICIALLY CALLED YET. THE FACT THAT THE  NONCUBAN-HISPANIC POPULATION IS  GROWING SO MUCH THERE AND VOTES DEMOCRATIC LIKE OTHER STATES. THAT WOULD HORRIFY ME THAT  FLORIDA MIGHT BE A TRUE PURPLE  STATE GOING FORWARD.
Jon:  WHAT I HAVE SEEN  FROM THAT SIDE IS A  JUSTIFICATION THAT THIS WAS NOTHING OF THEIR OWN DOING. THIS WAS A MORAL FAILING OF  THEIR OPPONENTS, THAT THERE ARE  NOW MORE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE MORALLY WEAK AND LAZY,  AND THAT'S WHY THEY LOST, HAVING  NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM. YOU LAUGH, BUT I'M TELL YOU, ALL  DAY LONG ON B.M.M., IT IS A  CONSTANT REFRAIN OF, "WELL, NOW WE'VE LEARNED. MOST OF THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T  WANT TO WORK FOR ANYTHING."
IT'S NOTHAT COMPLICATED. THEY DID WIN 48% THE VOTE. AND MAY BE YOU MODERATE A LITTLE  BIT ON IMMIGRATION AND GAY  MARRIAGE AND THE FISCAL CONSERVATIVE STUFF WILL ALWAYS  SELL TO A CERTAIN ODD YINS. IT'S HARD FOR DEMOCRATS TO WIN  THREE TERMS IN A ROW. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEIR  ACT TOGETHER. WE'LL SEE. FOUR YEARS IS A LONG TIME. WE'VE HAD, OBVIOUSLY, SHIFTS  BACK AND FORTH, IN THE PRIOR  FOUR YEARS. I DO THINK IF YOU-- LOOK AT HOW  JEB BUSH --
Stephen:  ARE YOU SO  REASONABLE. DON'T YOU WANT TO STAND UP AND  GO, "I AM NATE SILVER! BOW DOWN TO ME! "  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  "I AM NATE SILVER! LORD AND GOD OF THE  ALLEGORRISM!"  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I WANT YOU TO COME BACK IN SIX MONTHS AND LET'S JUST TALK  BASEBALL.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon:  THAT WOULD BE  AWESOME.
THANK YOU, JON.
Jon:  NATE SILVER.
