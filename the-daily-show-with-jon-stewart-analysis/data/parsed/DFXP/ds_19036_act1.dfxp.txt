FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST EVANGELINE LILLY. BUT FIRST -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS. [LAUGHTER] WE ALL KNOW CHRISTMAS IS EVERYONE'S FAVORITE HOLIDAY, EVERYONE'S. [ LAUGHTER ] -- EVERYONE'S. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR EVEN THE STAUNCHEST DEFENDERS OF CHRISTMAS TO KEEP THE SPIRIT OF THE SEASON WHEN CHRISTMAS ITS VERY ESSENCE IS UNDER CONSTANT SIEGE BY SOMEONE, SOMETHING. [LAUGHTER] IT'S THE SUBJECT OF THE NEW SEGMENT WAR ON CHRISTMAS (bleep) GETTING WEIRD EDITION. FIRST  UP. [ LAUGHTER ] THE GENERAL PATTON OF THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS. THERE'S A CRAZIER TOPIC OUT THERE.
REMEMBER THIS CLASSIC SEINFELD MOMENT.
OUT OF THAT A NEW HOLIDAY WAS BORN A FESTIVUS FOR THE REST OF US.
THAT'S A CLASSIC EPISODE. THE EPISODE WAS FUNNY BUT NOT FESTIVUS.
Jon: YES, THAT EPISODE WAS FUNNY BUT NOT FESTIVUS THE CENTRAL COMEDIC PART OF THE EPISODE. NOT FUNNY. WHY IS IT NOT A HOLIDAY FOR THE REST OF US.
A NEARLY SIX FOOT TALL FESTIVUS POLE MADE OF EMPTY
A NEARLY SIX FOOT TALL FESTIVUS POLE MADE OF EMPTY BEER CANS IS GOING TO GO ON DISPLAY AT THE FLORIDA CAPITAL. NOT KIDDING. IT'S PART OF A NOT SO SUBTLE PROTEST AGAINST THE NATIVITY SCENE ALREADY ON DISPLAY.
Jon: WHO GIVES A (bleep). CAN'T YOU JUST PRETEND IT'S A PLACE FOR THE WISEMEN TO TIE UP THE CAMELS. HOW ABOUT THAT? HYOU ARE CONCERED THERE'S A SIX FOOT FESTIVUS POLE MADE OUT OF BEER CANS? IT'S FLORIDA. YOU ARE LUCKY THERE'S NOT A STRIPPER NAMED CHRISTMAS SWINGING ON IT. HAVE YOU BEEN TO FLORIDA? I APOLOGIZE YOU ARE UPSET. WHY DO I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND WITH MY KIDS TO LOOK FOR NATIVITY SCENES AND BE LIKE OH, YEAH KIDS THERE'S BABY JESUS BEHIND THE FESTIVUS POLE MADE OUT OF BEER CANS. IT'S NUTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YES, THAT SOUNDS RELATIVELY NUTS. [LAUGHTER] WHY ARE YOU DRIVING AROUND -- [LAUGHTER] -- LOOKING FOR NATIVITY SCENES IN THE CAR WHEN YOU COULD JUST BRING YOUR KIDS TO WHERE YOU WORK WHERE YOU PUT A GIANT NATIVITY SCENE OUT ON THE PLAZA. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT AS MUCH AS I'M USED TO GRETCHEN'S YEARLY MANGER DANGER WARNINGS A LITTLE SURPRISED TO SEE MEGYN KELLY GOING FULL CHRISTMAS NOG.
ON SLATE.COM THEY HAVE A PIECE ABOUT SANTA CLAUS SHOULD NOT BE A WHITE PERSON ANYMORE. FOR ALL YOU KIDS AT HOME, SANTA IS WHITE BUT PEOPLE WANT A BLACK SANTA. BUT WE'RE JUST DEBATING THIS BECAUSE SANTA IS WHAT HE IS BUT WE'RE DEBATING IT BECAUSE SOMEONE WROTE ABOUT IT, KIDS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: (bleep) JUST GOT REAL. SANTA IS JUST WHITE. AND WHO ARE YOU ACTUALLY TALKING TO? [LAUGHTER] CHILDREN WHO ARE SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO BE WATCHING A NEWS CHANNEL AT 10:00 AT NIGHT, YET INNOCENT ENOUGH TO STILL BELIEVE SANTA CLAUS IS REAL YET RACIST ENOUGH TO BE FREAKED OUT IF HE ISN'T WHITE. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S SUCH A NARROW -- YES, WEST VIRGINIA, THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS. [LAUGHTER] BUT SINCE WE'RE PRETENDING TO DEBATE THIS, CARRY ON.
THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO HAVE, YOU KNOW SHE'S AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND SHE SEEMS TO HAVE REAL PAIN AT HAVING GROWN UP WITH THIS IMAGE OF A WHITE SANTA. JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS TO CHANGE.
Jon: ACTUALLY I THINK THAT IS THE OFFICIAL SLOGAN OF OPPRESSION. [ LAUGHTER ] OPPRESSION:  JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS TO CHANGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING? THAT'S ALSO THE SLOGAN OF ARBY'S. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DO THAT THEY ARE PERFECTLY NICE PEOPLE AND THEY MAKE PERFECTLY NICE FOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE CONTINUE TO DO THIS. YOU MAY WONDER ON THIS NEWS CHANNEL THEY ARE MAKING ASSERTIONS OF FACT ABOUT A FICTIONAL CHARACTER.
SANTA CLAUS IS BASED ON ST. NICHOLAS, WHO WAS AN ACTUALLY PERSON, A GREEK BISHOP AND WAS A WHITE MAN. YOU CAN'T TAKE FACTS AND TRY TO CHANGE THEM TO FIT A POLITICAL AGENDA OR A SENSITIVITY AGENDA.
Jon: THERE'S SO MUCH CRAZY GOING ON HERE. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DEAL WITH A FOX PUNDIT SAYING YOU CAN'T TAKE FACTS TO TRY TO CHANGE THEM TO FIT A POLITICAL AGENDA. EVEN THOUGH I CAN'T SAY THAT THAT'S HOW MUCH CRAZY IS GOING ON HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE'S SUGGESTING YOU CAN'T ARBITRARILY CHANGE THE FACTS ABOUT THE REAL HISTORICAL ST. NICHOLAS WHO WAS A WHITE MAN EVEN THOUGH HE WAS FROM  GREECE WHICH IS ACTUALLY TURKEY TODAY AND THAT WHITE MAN LIVES AT THE NORTH POLE AND DRIVES A SLEIGH PULLED BY FLYING REINDEER. BUT YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE FACTS. THE REAL ST. NICHOLAS IS FROM A PART OF THE WORLD WHICH IS NOW TURKEY HE PROBABLY LOOKED SOMETHING LIKE THIS ACCORDING TO RESEARCH DONE BY THE VATICAN. WHO EXACTLY IS CHANGING THE FACTS TO MAKE THEMSELVES MORE COMFORTABLE HERE? ACTUAL ST. NICHOLAS, WELL, MY GUESS IS THERE WOULD BE NO CHRISTMAS IF HE LOOKED LIKE THAT DUDE BECAUSE HE IS PROBABLY STILL ON THE NO FLY LIST. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THINGS GOT REALLY WEIRD.
JESUS WAS A WHITE MAN, TOO BUT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE -- HE WAS AN HISTORICAL FIGURE IT'S A VERIFIABLE FACT.
Jon: I'LL GIVE THAT YOU JESUS WAS AN HISTORICAL FIGURE BUT YOU'LL GET PUSHBACK ON THE WHITE THING. YOU DO KNOW HE WASN'T BORN IN BETHLEHEM PENNSYLVANIA RIGHT? WE'RE JOINED BY THE SENIOR CHRISTMAS HISTORICAL ACCURACY CORRESPONDENT JESSICA WILLIAMS. MERRY CHRISTMAS.
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
Jon: MERRY, MERRY CHRISTMAS.
HAPPY HOLIDAYS. THE BIG NEWS IS THAT JESUS IS WHITE THING IS THAT JEWS ARE WHITE NOW, CONGRATULATIONS, JON.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT SANTA? DO YOU FEEL THAT SANTA IS -- WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE INSISTING SANTA IS WHITE?
SANTA IS WHITE. IT'S A FACT. IT'S MIRACLE ON 34th STREET NOT MIRACLE ON 134th STREET. [ LAUGHTER ] THE ONLY MIRACLE ON 134th STREET IS THAT WE GET TO PARTICIPATE AT ALL. HALF THE TIME SANTA SKIPS US ON THE WAY DOWNTOWN JUST LIKE A TAXICAB.
Jon: SANTA IS FICTION HE'S NOT REAL.
HEY, MAN, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? KIDS, STOP CRYING, SANTA IS REAL (bleep) AND HE'S REALLY WHITE. REALLY WHITE.
Jon: JESSICA, IF WE'RE TALKING HISTORY HERE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE SAYING WE'RE TALKING FACT AND HISTORY ST. NICHOLAS WAS FROM THE AREA OF THE WORLD THAT IS NOW TURKEY. HE WAS NO A CHERUBIC WILFORD BRIMLEY TYPE.
THAT MAKES US UNCOMFORTABLE.
Jon: MEGHAN SAID JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD CHANGE IT.
SHE SAID IF I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE IT. IF WHITE PEOPLE ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT. THAT'S HOW THIS BECAME THIS. IT WORKS THAT WAY FOR EVERYTHING LIKE HOW THIS BECOMES THIS. WHITE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HEAR JAILHOUSE ROCK FROM SOMEBODY WHO WENT TO JAIL. REAL JAIL IS UNCOMFORTABLE. ELVIS JAIL IS FUN!
Jon: HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS HAVING FUN. â™ª AIN'T NOTHING BY A HOUNDDOG
RIGHT. JON, THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE. YOU FIX HISTORY AND LOCK THAT (bleep) DOWN. SANTA IS NOT BLACK JUST BECAUSE A BLOGGER SAYS HE WAS AND MEGYN IS NOT BLACK BECAUSE SHE SPELLS HER NAME CREATIVELY. AND LET'SS FACE IT JON, THERE'S NO WAY THIS COULD BE SANTA. THE MOMENT WHITE MEN SAW A BLACK TMAN WITH A BAG COMING DOWN THEK CHIMNEY, IT'D BE TIME TO GRAB A GUN AND STAND YOUR GROUND.
