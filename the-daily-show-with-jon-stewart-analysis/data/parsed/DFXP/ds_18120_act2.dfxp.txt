WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. WE TURN NOW TO THREE FAST  DEVELOPING CRIME STORIES.
OPENING STATEMENTS GOT  UNDER WAY IN THE TRIAL OF  THE ALLEGED MOB BOSS JAMES "WHITEY" BULGER. A MYSTERY SURROUNDING JIMMY  HOFFA POSSIBLY SOLVED.
INVESTIGATORS IN NEW YORK  ARE AT THE FORMER HOME OF  THE LATE JIMMY THE GENT  BURKE.
WOW, REAL LIFE OLD TIME  GANGSTER STORIES. THIS CAN ONLY MEAN THAT IT  IS TIME FOR MY NEW SEGMENT-- JL  CONFIDENTIAL. THERE IS JL CONFIDENTIAL  BROUGHT TO YOU BY PEPSI, YEA,  YEA, AN EMERGENCY, YEAH,  YEAH. FIRST UP, WHITEY BULGER. THE INFAMOUS ONE TIME HEAD  OF THE IRISH MOB IN BOSTON  RECENTLY CAPTURED AFTER 16 YEARS ON THE RUN.
THE 83-YEAR-OLD IS  ACCUSED OF DRUG TRAFFICKING,  EXTORTION AND MURDER, ALL WHILE WORKING AS AN FBI  INFORMANT. BULGER'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY JW  CARNEY ACKNOWLEDGED HIS  CLIENT DID COMMIT SOME  CRIMES. BUT HE INSISTED BULGER WAS  NOT MURDERER OR WORSE, A  GOVERNMENT SNITCH.
WHAT-- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HOW IS A GOVERNMENT SNITCH  WORSE THAN A MURDERER? FOR ME, CALL ME  OLD-FASHIONED, IT'S ALWAYS  BEEN MURDERER, ALL OTHER  VIOLENT CRIMES, AND SOMEWHERE DOWN THE BOTTOM  TATTLETALE. BUT ACCORDING TO BULGER'S  LAWYER WHO IS AN EXPERT IF  GANGSTER ETHICS, THIS  ACTUALLY ALL MAKES SENSE.
THE WORST THING AN IRISH  PERSON COULD CONSIDER DOING  WAS BECOMING AN INFORMANT.
IS IT? IF YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT  THE WORST THING AN IRISH  PERSON COULD CONSIDER DOING, YOU'VE CLEARLY NEVER BEEN TO  A NEW YORK ST. PATRICK'S DAY  PARADE. EVER. (APPLAUSE)  I MEAN EVER IN YOUR LIFE. SO LET'S MOVE ON TO CASE TWO. JIMMY HOFFA. FORMER KING STERS BOSS  ALTHOUGH AT THIS POINT HE'S  MAINLY FAMOUS FOR BEING  MISSING. HE BASICALLY OUR  GENERATION'S REAL LIFE  WALDO. BUT COULD THAT BE ABOUT TO  CHANGE?
INVESTIGATORS IN MICHIGAN  ARE DIGGING UP A FIELD NEAR  DETROIT FOR A SECOND DAY. AND THEY BELIEVE THIS TIME  THEY MAY UNEARTH HOFFA.
OH, THEY BELIEVE THAT, DO  THEY? OKAY, I'VE GOT A THOUSAND  DOLLARS THAT SAYS ARE YOU  NOT GOING TO FIND HIM.
RATS, NO LUCK N FINDING  THE REMAINS OF JIMMY HOFFA.
YOU EACH OWE ME 1,000  DOLLARS, YOU HEARD THAT,nd  YOU, AND YOU. NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT  THOUGHT THAT THIS JAIL PARTY  WAS A HOOPER, THINK AGAIN. THE THIRD AT THE FORMER HOME  OF JAMES BURKE, JIMMY THE  GENT CONTINUES IN QUEENS.
YOU MAY NOT RECOGNIZE HIS  NAME BUT HE WAS THE REAL  LIFE INSPIRATION FOR ROBERT DE NIRO'S UNFORGETABLE  CHARACTER IN GOODFELLAS.
WOW. GOODFELLAS, I LOVE THAT  MOVIE. THE GIVE ME THE GENTRY'S  HOUSE BECAUSE THEY GOT A  TIPPY WAX ON GUY, SEE. PWEAU, PW ON OH, I CAN'T DO  THIS, I CAN'T DO THIS, THIS  IS A STORY THAT ACTUALLY DIRECTLY INVOLVES THE MOVIE  GOODFELLAS. AND THIS GUY ISN'T HERE. HE WOULD LOVE THIS SO MUCH. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HE LOVED  GOODFELLAS. YOU KNOW WHAT, JON, THIS  ONE'S FOR YOU.
