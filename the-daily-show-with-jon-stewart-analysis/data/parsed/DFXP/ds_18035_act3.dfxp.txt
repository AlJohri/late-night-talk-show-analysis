WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE BISHOP  OF THE EPISCOPAL DIOCESE OF NEW  HAMPSHIRE. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED GOD  BELIEVES IN LOVE. STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT GAY  MARRIAGE. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  BISHOP GENE ROBINSON.
THANK YOU. I HAVE A PRESENT FOR YOU. I BROUGHT YOU A DREIDEL.   ( APPLAUSE )   I READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE  BACK. IT'S A GAMBLING DREIDEL
Jon: THEY ALL ARE. THANK YOU. I DON'T HAVE BUT THOUSANDS OF  THESE. NOW, DO YOU GO TO HANUKKAH  CELEBRATIONS PLAY A LITTLE  DREIDEL
I DON'T DO THE GAMBLING THING  Jon: OF COURSE NOT. GAMBLING. I MEANT THE FUN.
I'M MORE A SEDER KIND OF GUY  Jon: THAT'S NOT FOR ME. IT'S COME ON, JUST EAT.
IT GOES ON FOR HOURS  Jon: AND YOU'RE CELEBRATING  FREEDOM
I LIKE THAT  Jon: THE JEWS WANDERED FOR 40  YEARS BUT I CAN'T EAT NOW. WE'LL HAVE A SEDER SOMETIME. I ALWAYS LEAVE A SEAT OPEN. HERE'S WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE. YOU GOT THIS BOOK "GOD BELIEVES  IN LOVE."  THE TIMING OF IT COULD NOT BE  MORE APPROPRIATE. YOU HAVE THE SUPREME COURT OF  THE UNITED STATES IS ABOUT TO  TAKE UP THE CASE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT  IS CONSTITUTIONAL. IS IT?
I'LL TELL YOU. THE TIMING WAS SO AMAZING. YOU KNOW, WE'RE REACHING THIS  MOMENT IN WHICH EVEN PEOPLE OF  FAITH -- MAYBE ESPECIALLY PEOPLE OF FAITH -- ARE SEEING THAT  THERE IS A WAY WAY FORWARD ON  THIS GAY MARRIAGE ISSUE. WE'RE SEEING IT IN ALL AGES, ALL  RACES, ALL DENOMINATIONS. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE LOOKING AT OUR  FAMILIES. THEY'RE LOOKING AT OUR  RELATIONSHIPS. THEY'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE RAISED  OUR KIDS. WHAT THEY'RE SEEING IS ALL  AMERICAN FAMILY VALUES. YOU THINK THE CONSERVATIVES  WOULD BE FOR THAT. WOULDN'T YOU
Jon: IT'S SO SURPRISING TO ME  THAT THIS IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE  ISSUE TO TRY AND BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT  THAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE THE  FOUNDATION OF ANY RATIONAL STRUCTURED SOCIETY. MORE PEOPLE GETTING MARRIED  SEEMS BETTER THAN LESS.
ABSOLUTELY. I THINK BACK TO RAISING OUR TWO  DAUGHTERS, YOU KNOW, THE WILD  GAY LIFESTYLE THAT EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT WAS SATURDAY NIGHT  PLAYING BOARD GAMES AND WATCHING  THE GOLDEN GIRLS AND GOING TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY MORNING AND  MAKING SURE THERE WERE CLEAN  CLOTHES FOR SCHOOL ON MONDAY. OUR FAMILIES ARE LIKE OTHER  PEOPLE'S FAMILIES. WE'RE JUST SEEING THE TIPPING  POINT, I THINK, IN AMERICAN  CULTURE. AND IN RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS
Jon: I FEEL LIKE MANY PEOPLE  OF FAITH ARE STRUGGLING TO GET  SOME FOUNDATION TO AGREE WITH THIS BECAUSE THEIR EXPERIENCE IS  EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAY. BUT THEY NEED TO NOT ALSO  ABANDON SCRIPTURE. THAT'S WHAT YOU TRY AND DO HERE
I WAS RAISED IN A VERY  CONSERVATIVE SEMINARY OUT WEST. THE EVANGELICALS ARE EVEN  FINDING THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO  HAVE GAY AND LESBIAN FRIENDS ARE LEAVING THEM BECAUSE THEY KNOW  THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING SAID  ABOUT LBGT PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY NOT  TRUE. MY SENSE IS THAT THERE'S A REAL  HUNGER EVEN AMONGST THE MORE  CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS TO FIND A WAY  FORWARD ON THIS. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS WHERE LOVE  IS, THERE IS GOD ALSO. THEY SEE THAT LOVE IN OUR  FAMILIES. I THINK PEOPLE CAN'T HELP BUT BE  SUPPORTIVE.
Jon: I READ THE BIBLE BECAUSE  I STAY IN A LOT OF HOTELS.
YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH THOSE GID  IONS.
Jon: BUT IT ALWAYS STRUCK ME  WHEN THEY USED THE BIBLICAL  FOUNDATION TO BE AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE THEY WOULD USE  LEVITICUS AT TIMES THAT SAYS TO  LAY WITH A MAN IS AN  ABOMINATION. IF YOU READ LEVITICUS, EATING  SHELLFISH IS AN ABOMINATION. WHY AREN'T THEY ALSO TRYING TO  SHUT DOWN RED LOBSTER? DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WHERE IS THE CONSISTENCY OF  THOUGHT THERE?
WELL THERE'S NOT A LOT OF  CONSISTENCY. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, YOU  KNOW, WE HAVE TO TAKE SCRIPTURE  IN ITS CONTEXT. YOU KNOW, THEY TRIED TO ROPE  JESUS INTO THIS THING, RIGHT? HERE'S A GUY WHO IN A CULTURE  THAT VIRTUALLY DEMANDED  MARRIAGE, A SINGLE GUY SPENDING MOST OF HIS TIME WITH 12 MEN  SINGLED OUT THREE OF THEM FOR  LEADERSHIP. ONE OF THEM IS KNOWN IN THE  BIBLE AS THE ONE WHOM JESUS  LOVED. NOW I'M NOT SAYING JESUS WAS  GAY. BUT LET'S BE CAREFUL TO ROPE  THIS GUY IN FOR A HUSBAND-WIFE  AND 2.2 CHILDREN AS A MODEL FOR  FAMILIES. HE KNEW ABOUT FAMILIES OF  CHOICE. AND SO DO L.G.B.T. PEOPLE
Jon: I'VE HEARD SOME SAY IT  WAS A LAST BRUNCH AND NOT A  SUPPER. SOME HAVE SAID.
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT  REALLY CLEAR. WOULDN'T IT?
Jon: I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT  SORT OF THE PUSHBACK YOU FACED  IN THE COMMUNITY OF FAITH AND ALL THIS SORTS OF THING. THE BOOK IS CALLED "GOD BELIEVES  IN LOVE" IT'S ON THE BOOK  SHELVES NOW. WE'RE TALKING TO BISHOP GENE  ROBINSON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
