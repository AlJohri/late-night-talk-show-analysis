FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW  YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW! MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER! I'M STILL HERE. JON STEWART HAS BEEN  SPENDING HIS SUMMER IN THE  MIDDLE EAST DIRECTING A  MOVIE THAT HE WROTE. THAT IMAGE IS NOT PHOTO SHOP  THAT IS A REAL PICTURE. I SUPPOSE IT'S ONLY FAIR  THAT I LEVEL WITH ALL OF  YOU. I HAVE BEEN LYING ABOUT  WHERE JON STEWART'S BEEN ALL  SUMMER. IN FACT, I'VE LIED TO YOU  EXACTLY 31 TIMES IT SEEMED  APPROPRIATE TO CONFESS  TONIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS MY LAST SHOW AT INTERIM HOST. STOP HIDING YOUR JOY. JON STEWART WILL BE BACK IN  SEPTEMBER. WE'RE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO  SEEING HIM SO MUCH. BEFORE WE GO INTO OUR TOP  STORY TONIGHT WE JUST WANTED  TO TAKE A MOMENT TO  ACKNOWLEDGE THE HORRIFYING EVENTS UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW  IN EGYPT. OUR DEEPEST THOUGHTS ARE  WITH EVERYONE OVER THERE FOR  MORE ON THAT DEVELOPING  STORY, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY WATCH THE REAL NEWS. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THEY'RE  BUILT FOR. IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE GOING  TO PUSH AHEAD WITH OUR FINAL  SILLY SHOW OF THE SUMMER, OUR GUEST TONIGHT WRITER AND  OF THE SILLY SHOW SIMON PEG  WILL BE WITH US. FRANKLY, SIMON HAS A LOT TO  LIVE UP TO TONIGHT GUEST  WISEMENT I DON'T KNOW IF HE SAW LAST NIGHT'S SHOW BUT  REGIS PHIL PYNN ENDED THE  INTERVIEW IN A SLIGHTLY  UNEXPECTED MANNER. ♪ LOOKS LIKE WE MADE IT ♪  ♪ HE KISSED ME ON THE HEAD. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I WOKE UP  THIS MORNING AND HI A GRAY  PATCH OF HAIR IN THE EXACT SHAPE OF REGIS'S LIPS. AND I REALIZED HE JUST SAPD  MY YOUTH. THAT'S HOW HE STILL LOOKS SO  INCREDIBLE. HE SUCKS YEARS FROM THE  HEADS OF MEN THROUGH HIS  LIPS. HE TOOK TEN YEARS FROM MY  LIFE. AND I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING  T WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT! EVERYTHING FELT BETTER IN  THAT MOMENT. THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A FUN  SUMMER SO MANY MEMORIES. TRADITIONALLY THIS CAN BE A  SLOW TIME FOR NEWS BUT THIS  PARTICULAR SUMMER HAS BEEN JUST ONE STORY AFTER  ANOTHER. WE HAD THE VOTING RIGHTS  ACT. GAY MARRIAGE. PAULA DEEN. WE DID IMMIGRATION. THERE WAS A ROYAL BABY WITH  JASON JONES PUNCHING A HORSE  IN THE FACE. WE HAD A MID SHOW BLACKOUT  FORCING ME TO INTERVIEW ERIC  IN THE DARK. THEN THERE WAS, OF COURSE,  THAT NIGHT THE DARK PUNK  PLAYED LIVE IN OUR STUDIO  INSTEAD OF GOING ON COLBERT. THAT WAS FUN. THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS  THAT AMAZING MOMENT WHERE  HELEN MIRIN WAS A GUEST AND  SHE DECIDED TO SLIP AND SLIDE OVER TO THE DESK. IF YOU MISSED THAT I'M TRULY  SORRY. SOME STORIES HAVE ALSO  DEVELOPED SINCE WE COVERED  THEM. AND I JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY  UPDATE YOU ON THEM. TIDDY EVERYTHING UP BEFORE  JON GETS BACK HERE. FIRST YOU MIGHT REMEMBER  ACCUSED SEXUAL HARASSER AND  ASSAULTER BOB FILLNER BEST KNOWN FOR HIS WORK AS THE  SAN DIEGO MAYOR, AS WELL ASS  HAD HIS ROLE OPPOSITE  MICHAEL KEATON IN 1989'S  BATMAN. NOW THAT MIGHT SEEN LIKE A  CRUEL JOKE ABOUT SOMEONE'S  APPEARANCE. IN MY DEFENSE, [BLEEP] THIS  GUY. (APPLAUSE)
THAT'S MY DEFENSE. OVER A DOZEN FEMALE  EMPLOYEES HAVE ACCUSED  FILLNER OF UNWANTED SEXUAL  ADVANCEMENT BUT NOW IT SEEMS HIS MISSIVES MAY NOT HAVE  STOPPED THERE.
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING  INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF  IMPROVE CHARGES ON HIS CITY CREDIT CARD.
WORKING INTO A JUNKET  PHILNER TOOK A-- THAT  APPEARS TO HAVE LITTLE TO DO TO SAN DIEGO AND COST  TAXPAYERS $30,000. $3,000 TO AN ON-LINE  REPUTATION MANAGEMENT FIRM. AND ODDLY, 128 DOLLARS FOR A  JUICER.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. THE JOOUTSER-- JUICER IS THE  THING YOU FIND ODD THERE? NOT THE $3,000 ON REPUTATION  MANAGEMENT? BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING  THE CITY CLEARLY DOES  DESERVE A REFUN ON. THERE IS ALSO ONE OTHER  RECENT REVELATION ABOUT BOB  FILLNER THAT I HESITATE TO  EVEN SHOW YOU.
THERE ARE NEW ALLEGATIONS  THAT MAYOR FILLNER SEXUALLY  HARASSED MILITARY RAPE  VICTIMS.
THAT MAY BE THE SINGLE  WORST SENTENCE I HAVE HEARD  ALL SUMMER. EVEN A KISS ON THE HEAD FROM  REGIS PHIL PIN CANNOT ERASE  THE PAIN OF HEARING THAT. IF I PAY, I WOULD LIKE TO DO  A QUICK IMPRESSION OF BOB  FILLNER'S REPUTATION MANAGER AFTER HEARING THAT SENTENCE. UM, OKAY, [BLEEP] THIS. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR $3,000  BACK. LIFE'S TOO SHORT YOU PIECE  OF [BLEEP]. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LET'S GET AS FAR AWAY FROM  THAT STORY AS WE POSSIBLY  CAN. LET'S GO TO RUSSIA. ALSO KNOWN AS THE COUNTRY TO  WHICH EDWARD SNOWDEN IS NOW  HAVING HIS MAIL FORWARDED. NOW AS YOU'LL RECALL WHILE  THE SUPREME COURT HERE WAS  OVERTURNING THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT IN RUSSIA, THEY  PASSED A BRAND-NEW ANTI-GAY  PROPAGANDA LAW AND DESPITE CRITICISM, THEY ARE  DEFENDING THEIR DECISION.
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT  VLADIMIR PUTIN PUBLICLY  DEFENDED THE LAW EARLIER  THIS SUMMER. THIS IS NOT ABOUT IMPOSING  ANY KIND OF SANCTIONS  AGAINST HOMOSEXUALITY, HE  SAID THIS IS ABOUT PROTECTING CHILDREN.
IS IT THOUGH? IS IT? ARE YOU SURE THIS ISN'T SOME  HOMOPHOBIC LEGISLATION  PASSED JUST TO PREVENT THE  YOU WEREAN POLICE WERE BEING MADE FUN OF BECAUSE WHEN YOU  LOOK AT THEIR UNIFORMS IN  THE MIRROR THEY SAY HOMO. YOU SURE THAT'S NOT IT? YOU SURE THAT'S NOT IT? THAT IS A LITTLE TRICKY WHEN  THEY ARE PULLING YOU OVER. OLGA, HOW FAST WERE YOU  GOING. THE GAY POLICE ARE GAINING  ON US. REASSURINGLY, THERE'S  ACTUALLY BEEN HUGE  INTERNATIONAL REACTION  AGAINST THIS LAW. AND IT IS TAKING ALL SORTS  OF FORMS.
PROTESTS IN ENGLAND,  SCOTLAND, BELGIUM, CANADA,  THE U.S. FOR OWNERS OF GAY BARS  DUMPED JURBAN VODKA.
POURING VODKA INTO THE  GUTTERS. A POWERFUL STAND AGAINST  HOMOPHOBIA AND FOR DRUNK  SEWER ALLIGATORS. I LOVE YOU. YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND. THE PROBLEM IS, THAT THIS  LAW IS JUST A PART OF A MUCH  LARGER SHIFT TOWARDS PERCENT CUTION OF GAY PEOPLE IN  RUSSIA.
ANOTHER TV ANCHOR IN  RUSSIA COMING UNDER FIRE FOR  THINGS HE SAID ABOUT GAY PEOPLE DURING A BROADCAST  LAST YEAR.
WE NEED TO BAN THEM FROM  DONATING BLOOD AND SPERM. AND IF THEY DIE IN CAR  ACCIDENTS, WE NEED TO BURY  THEIR HEARTS IN THE GROUND  OR BURN THEM AS THEY ARE UNSUITABLE FOR THE AIDING OF  ANYONE'S LIFE.
WHAT? BURY THEIR HEARTS IN THE  GROUND-- I-- I THINK HE MAY  BE CONFUSING GAY PEOPLE WITH  VAMPIRES. NEVER INVITE A GAY INTO YOUR  HOME OR WILL VISIT YOU AT  NIGHT IN THE FORM OF A BAT OR A FINE MIST. BUT HERE'S THE THING. IN RUSSIA, THAT'S ACTUALLY  CONSIDERED ACCURATE  SCIENTIFIC DATA.
DMITRI-- INSISTS AFTER  ALL THAT HE IS NOT HOMEO  PHOBIC. HE SAYS HE WAS SIMPLY  SUPPORTING MEDICAL RULES  DENY-- DESIGNED TO PREVENT  HIV POSITIVE MEN FROM DONATING BLOOD OR ORGANS.
OH, PLEASE THAT IS  RIDICULOUS. WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WOULD  BAN GAY MEN FROM DONATING  BLOOD BASED ON SOME KIND OF PATHETIC, ARCHAIC AIDS  PARANOIA.
RIGHT NOW IN THE UNITED  STATES GAY MEN CANNOT DONATE  BLOOD.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I  WON'T MISS ABOUT HOSTING  THIS SHOW, HAVING PERFECTLY EDITED SOUND BITES ROUTINELY  CONTRADICT THE THING I JUST  SAID. AND FINALLY--   (APPLAUSE)
FINALLY, I JUST WANT TO  PERSONALLY SAY A BIG THANK  YOU TONIGHT BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE  GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND TO  MAKE MY JOB SO MUCH EASIER  THIS SUMMER THAN IT COULD HAVE BEEN. AND ONE IN PARTICULAR. I'M TALKING, OF COURSE B  ANTHONY WEINER. OR-- OR SHOULD I SAY CARLOS  DANGER.
DANGER.
THE REAL-- NOW THIS WEEK  HE JOINS THE OTHER  DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR  MAYOR IN A TELEVISED DEBATE USING HIS TIME TO SAY THIS.
MY NAME IS ANTHONY WEINER  AND I WANT TO BE YOUR MAYOR.
NOW A COUPLE OF THINGS  STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT, FIRST,  DOES ANTHONY WEINER REALLY THINKS HE NEEDS TO TELL  PEOPLE HIS NAME ANY MORE? BECAUSE WHILE THERE ARE MANY  OBSTACLES TO HIS GETTING  ELECTED, NAME RECOGNITION IS DEFINITELY NOT ONE OF THEM. AND SECOND, DOES HE WANT TO  BE MAYOR? BECAUSE THE WAY HE IS BEEN  CAMPAIGNING RECENTLY IT KIND  OF SEEMS LIKE HE MIGHT NOT. CASE IN POINT, EARLIER THIS  WEEK HE GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO  THE WEB SITE BUZZ FEED.
I THINK YOU CAN DO THIS.
I THINK IS  SOMETHING-- YOU CAN DO THIS  OR SHOW VIDEOS OF CATS,  WHATEVER YOU DO AT BUZZ FEED BUT --
WHAT'S HE DOING? IT IS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO  MAKE PEOPLE HATE HIM NOW. I CAN'T TELL IF HE WANTS TO  BE MAYOR OR A HEEL IN THE  WWF. SHOCKING NEW YORK, YOUR TOWN  SMELLS LIKE PISS. CHICAGO'S GOT BETTER-- THAN  THE RED SOX. WEINER 2013! THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS ON  THIS ABOUT THIS SUMMER. BUT ON THIS YOU MOST OF  ALL-- MISS YOU MOST OF ALL  CARLOS DANGER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
