[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO, LET ME JUST, LET ME JUST JUMP IN. I NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR SOMETHING I SAID JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO ABOUT NANCY PELOSI. SHE MAY NOT RECALL WHO JONATHAN GRUBER IS. BUT TODAY IS A DAY FOR HER TO CELEBRATE.
ABC NEWS CAN CONFIRM THAT NANCY PELOSI HAS BEEN REELECTED MINORITY LEADER.
Jon: HUZZAH! AND WHAT A MINORITY THE DEMOCRATS ARE. I THINK AT THIS POINT THERE MIGHT ONLY BE THREE OF THEM LEFT. IN FACT, AFTER THE DRUBBING THE DEMOCRATS TOOK IN THE MIDTERM, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE ASKING IF NANCY PELOSI WOULD STEP DOWN.
AREN'T YOU GETTING A LITTLE OLD, MITCH? SHOULDN'T YOU STEP ASIDE, YOU HAVE ASKED HIM THAT QUESTION?
Jon: WHY WOULD ANYONE ASK MITCH MCCONNELL THAT QUESTION? HE'S ONLY 72 YEARS OLD. THAT'S BARELY A THIRD OF HIS NATURAL LIFESPAN. I DON'T KNOW WHY -- WHY WOULD YOU -- HE'S BUT A TEENAGER. I'M GONNA LIVE TO BE 208. [LAUGHING] AND BY THE WAY WHAT IS YOUR BEEF WITH MCCONNELL.
I WAS NEVER ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE EVEN THOUGH I WAS THE FIRST WOMAN -- ISN'T THAT A CURIOSITY THAT THE REPUBLICANS WIN BOEHNER'S ON THE FRONT OF TIME MAGAZINE. MITCH MCCONNEL WINS, HE'S ON THE FRONT OF TIME MAGAZINE. ISN'T THERE A PATTERN HERE? AS A WOMAN IT'S LIKE, IS THERE A MESSAGE HERE?
Jon: NO, I HEAR YOU. WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN THE SAME REVERED COMPANY AS HITLER AND DARKENED OJ. BUT SO WHAT, YOU DIDN'T GET THE TIME MAGAZINE COVER. BUT YOU DID GET AN AWARD FROM THE NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP FOR WOMEN AND FAMILIES FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN FIGHTING FOR WORKING WOMEN. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, NANCY PELOSI. I DON'T THINK HITLER OR OJ EVER GOT HONORED BY THOSE PEOPLE. YOU'RE A RECOGNIZED CHAMPION OF WORKING WOMEN AND VOTING RIGHTS.
RIGHT TO VOTE MUST REMAIN THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. WHEN WOMEN SUCCEED, AMERICA SUCCEEDS. EARLY VOTING IS OUR FRIEND. RESPECT TO THE NEEDS OF WOMEN AND FAMILIES.
Jon: YOU'RE VOTING AND LADY BONAFIDES ARE UNMATCHED. AND THAT'S WHAT BRINGS ME TO THIS. ILLINOIS REPRESENTATIVE TAMMY DUCKWORTH DISABLED IRAQ WAR VETERAN 8 MONTHS PREGNANT ASKED PERMISSION TO VOTE BY PROXY IN THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS ELECTIONS BECAUSE HER DOCTER TOLD HER SHE COULDN'T FLY TO WASHINGTON. LUCKY FOR HER THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF HER PARTY AND THAT VOTE IS THE GUARDIAN HERSELF, NANCY PELOSI. WHAT A PERFECT CHANCE TO SHOWCASE HER PRINCIPLES.
PELOSI OPPOSED DUCKWORTH'S REQUEST TO VOTE BY PROXY.
Jon: THANK YOU, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THESE TOUGH  -- WAIT WHAT THE [BEEP]? YOU REJECTED, YOU SUPPRESSING THE VOTE OF A MINORITY PREGNANT WOMAN WHO IS A WOUNDED WAR VETERAN. SHE IS EVERYTHING YOU SUPPOSEDLY STAND FOR, STUFFED INTO ONE INDIVIDUAL. SHE IS A DEMOCRATIC DEMOGRAPHIC TURDUCKWORTH. WHY? WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?
MINORITY LEADER PELOSI DEFENDED THE DECISION SAYING IT'S AGAINST HOUSE RULES AND THAT MAKING AN EXCEPTION FOR DUCKWORTH COULD SET AN UNWANTED PRECEDENT.
Jon: WHAT? WELL WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SET ANY DANGEROUS NEW PRECEDENTS BY CHANGING ANTIQUATED CAUCUS VOTE RULES SO THAT WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT CAN PARTICIPATE. WHY NEXT, THOSE CONGRESS LADIES WILL DEMAND SPECIAL LADY BATHROOMS LADY URINALS. AND IT'S CHAOS! YOU KNOW -- [LAUGHING] I GOT TO TELL YOU. I WOULD USE ONE OF THOSE. [LAUGHING] AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO? I WOULD REST THE BALLS. I WOULD PEE AND AS I PEE I WOULD REST THE BALLS. [LAUGHING] I'M SORRY, YOU SEE, SOMETIMES YOU DON'T SEE THEM. AND THEN WHEN YOU SEE THEM IT JUST -- WELL -- [LAUGHING] YOU SEE -- (CLEARING THROAT) IMPORTANT ISSUE AT HAND, STEWART. YOU SEEMED OKAY WITH SETTING A NEW PRECEDENT WHEN YOU BECAME THE FIRST FEMALE HOUSE SPEAKER OR WHEN YOU FILED THE SUPREME COURT AMICUS BRIEF ON BEHALF OF A PREGNANT WOMAN WHOSE EMPLOYER REFUSED TO MODIFY WORK CONDITIONS SO SHE COULD CONTINUE WORKING. WHY NOT THIS CASE?
SORT OF A PROXY BATTLE FOR THE TOP DEMOCRATIC JOB ON THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE, IT PITS NEW JERSEY DEMOCRAT FRANK PALLONE WHO HAS THE SENORITY AGAINST CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT ANNA ESHOO WHO IS A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF PELOSI'S.
IT SEEMS THAT REPRESENTATIVE DUCKWORTH WAS SIDING WITH CONGRESSMAN PALLONE, SO LO AND BEHOLD SUDDENLY SHE CAN'T VOTE BY PROXY.
Jon: AND THAT'S HOW THE PRECEDENT WAS SET THAT A WOMAN LEADER, COULD BE EVERY BIT AS POLITICALLY CRAVEN AS HER MALE COUNTERPARTS. LET ME SAY THIS, YOU GO GIRL. SERIOUSLY, YOU SHOULD GO. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
