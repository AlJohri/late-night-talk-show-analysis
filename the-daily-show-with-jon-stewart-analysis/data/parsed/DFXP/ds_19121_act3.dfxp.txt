Jon: THEY'RE VERY NICE PEOPLE. SO HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. WE COULD SPEND THE TIME TALKING ABOUT THE MOVIE, BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW...
LET'S TALK. MAN, I'M HERE. I WANNA... I'M IN YOUR WORLD.
Jon: BUT HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT... YOU DID SOMETHING, AND I DON'T GET TO TALK ABOUT THIS WITH ANYBODY ELSE HERE.
OK.
Jon: YOU HOSTED RAW. "MONDAY NIGHT RAW." IS THAT CORRECT?
HOLY SCHNIKES, YES. YES.
Jon: WWE.
WWE RAW.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. SO WHENEVER I'M HERE, MY SON AND I...
OK.
Jon: THAT'S ALL WE DO, IS WATCH WRESTLING.
THAT'S ALL YOU ALL DO IS WATCH WRESTLING.
Jon: IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE BOY...
OK.
IS THROUGH VIOLENCE. BUT YOU COME IN HERE AND THEY'RE ALL LIKE, DID YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED ON CNN? AND I'M LIKE, EVOLUTION BROKE UP, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
HOW SERIOUS IT IS. LISTEN, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU, MAN, I'M A FAN. FIRST OF ALL, I'M A FAN OF WRESTLING.
Jon: YES.
AND, I'VE DROPPED OFF, YOU KNOW, AS I'VE GOTTEN OLDER, SO...
Jon: OH YEAH, NO, ME, TOO. I'M NOT... [LAUGHTER]
HOW, HOW OLD IS YOUR KID? HOW OLD IS YOUR KID?
Jon: HE'S 23.
HE'S 23! WHAT?
Jon:, NO, HE'S NOT. HE'S NOT. HE'S TURNING TEN. BUT HE'S NINE AND HE JUST DISCOVERED IT THIS YEAR.
NO, THAT'S THE PERFECT AGE, THOUGH. THAT'S AROUND THE AGE THAT I WAS INTO IT, TOO.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
SO, I CAN SAY ME GOING HERE BROUGHT BACK ALL THE MEMORIES OF WHEN I WAS LIKE JUST ENGULFED IN THIS, IN THIS SPORT...
Jon: WHO WERE THE BIG GUYS WHEN YOU WERE A KID?
WHEN I WAS A KID? OH, DUSTY RHODES, RIC FLAIR, JUNK YARD DOG, KOKO B. WARE. ROAD WARRIORS. I'M SHOWING MY AGE RIGHT NOW.
Jon: OH, YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO SHOW SOME AGE,
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW... ...BRUNO SAN MARTINO, GORILLA MONSOON, HAYSTACKS CALHOUN.
OH, MY GOSH.
JIMMY SUPERFLY SNUKA.
I REMEMBER JIMMY...
Jon: YOU DO REMEMBER JIMMY?
I REMEMBER HIM. CHIEF JAY STRONGBOW.
NO, NO, YOU ARE 1 FOR 6 FOR ME RIGHT NOW. I KNEW NONE OF THOSE, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY WERE WRESTLERS.
Jon: WHAT WAS IT, SO, SO, DID YOU, DID THEY WANT TO THROW YOU? DID YOU DO ANY...
THEY CAME OUT, NO, THEY COME OUT WITH ALL PHYSICAL STUFF FIRST. HEY, KEVIN, IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. WE'LL GET YOU IN THE RING. I SAID, WELL, LET'S STOP RIGHT THERE. I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT. I SAID, I'M NOT GOING IN THE RING. I DON'T WANT TO DO ANY STUNTS WITH THESE GUYS.
Jon: YEAH.
I SAID, NO, LET'S JUST, LET'S DO SOMETHING WHERE, I CAN, YOU KNOW, I CAN SHINE. AND IT WAS LIKE, WHAT DO DO YOU? ARE YOU FAST? I WAS LIKE, I CAN TALK. I SAID, I WANT TO GO AND I WANT TO COMMENTATE. LET ME COMMENTATE.
Jon: NICE.
BUT THAT WAY I CAN TALK ABOUT THE SPORT, I CAN BE A PERSONALITY. SO, THEY'RE LIKE, OKAY, OKAY. GOOD, WE'LL DO THAT.  AND, I GET THERE, AND THEY SAID, KEVIN, WE CAME UP WITH SOMETHING GREAT FOR YOU. WE CAN GET YOU IN THE RING. AND I WAS LIKE, WELL, WELL, LISTEN, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU ALL I DIDN'T WANT TO GET UP IN THAT RING. YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT. SO I GET IN THE RING AFTER THIS GUY'S FIGHT, AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S A DANCER, FANDANGO, IT'S NOT FANDANGO, IT'S FAN-DAN-GO.
Jon: FAN-DAN-GO. YEAH.
YEAH. SO, AFTER HE WINS, YOU KNOW, HE DOES THESE DANCES, AND HE'S REALLY ENGULFED IN IT, AND I GET IN AND I DANCE WITH HIM, BUT THE FUNNY THING IS, THE ROPES, LIKE, I HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RESPECT FOR THE ROPES. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GO, IT'S THE FIRST, THE SECOND AND THIRD. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PULL FIRST TWO APART AND STEP THROUGH IT.
THE FIRST MAN IN HISTORY. I PULL THE BOTTOM, I WENT THROUGH... I WENT THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE ROPE. AND AFTER I DID IT, LIKE, I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE I DID IT. AND, I COME OFF AND ALL THE WRESTLERS WERE, HEY, THAT WAS PRETTY FUNNY THE WAY YOU DID THAT GOING THROUGH THE BOTTOM THING. AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT WAS FUNNY? IT WAS LIKE, IT WAS LIKE THAT WAS A BIT, RIGHT? YOU DID THAT FOR JOKES. NO, THAT WAS MY LEVEL. THAT'S, THAT'S WHERE, THAT'S WHERE I AM.
Jon: THAT'S HOW I GET INTO THIS THING.
THAT'S HOW I NATURALLY GOT INTO IT.
Jon: HAVE YOU EVER GOTTEN A CHANCE, YOU KNOW, IN YOUR CAREER YOU GET CHANCE TO DO... YOU'RE PROBABLY LIKE ME, I'M A HUGE SPORTS FAN. HAVE YOU GOT AN CHANCE TO GET INTO ATHLETIC SITUATIONS THAT HAVE BLOWN YOUR MIND OR MET AN IDOL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
OH, TONS OF THEM. WELL, JON, YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS, BUT YOU'RE LOOKING AT A TWO-TIME CELEBRITY M.V.P. FOR THE ALL-STAR WEEKEND.
Jon: NO, NO, I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.
YEAH. YES.
Jon: AND, WHAT'S YOUR, WHAT'S YOUR FIELD OF...
BASKETBALL. YOU KNOW, IT WAS A, IT IS A PASTIME, YOU KNOW, THING OF MINE. WHATEVER. I COULD HAVE WENT TO THE LEAGUE. I CHOSE NOT TO.
Jon: NO, I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND. SMART CHOICE. YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL. YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL.
Jon: ME AND YOU SHOULD START A LEAGUE FOR THE GENTLEMAN PLAYER THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE SIZE...
THE SIZE...
Jon: YET STILL CONSIDERS THEMSELVES SOMEWHAT AGILE.
WELL, I'M AGILE, BUT THEN YOU GO TO THE SPORT WHERE YOUR SIZE WORKS, LIKE SOCCER. AND, THEN I FIGURED OUT I'M NOT REALLY THAT FAST. YOU KNOW, SO,  I GOT PROS AND CONS FOR EVERYTHING I'VE DONE. I BOX. AND, I WAS REALLY GOOD WHEN I HAD A TRAINER.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW, BUT I JUST HIT HIS HANDS, AND HE WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT WAS NOTHING ELSE. IT WAS JUST HIS HANDS. AND I WAS LIKE, YO, I'M REALLY GOOD. AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS LIKE, YO, I'M FAST. MY TIMING IS GREAT.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
AND ONE DAY WE WERE DOING IT, AND, YOU KNOW, HE DID THIS. HE'S NEVER DONE THIS EVER. HE'S NEVER... LISTEN, WE TRAINED SO MUCH. NOT ONCE HAS HE EVER DONE THIS, BUT I GUESS HE EXPECTED A NASTY REACTION. SO, YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE ONE-TWO-THREE, ONE-TWO, BOP-BOP-BOP. AND HE WENT LIKE THIS. AND, IT HIT ME. I STOPPED. I TOOK MY GLOVES OFF. I SAID, WHAT IS THAT ABOUT? WHEN DID WE START FIGHTING BACK? LIKE, WHAT IS THAT? I WAS PISSED OFF. I WAS LIKE, DUDE, I'M DONE, I'M NOT, LIKE I'M DONE WITH THIS SESSION.
Jon: THIS IS NOT BOXING.
HE WAS LIKE, KEVIN, THIS IS FOR YOU TO DUCK. I WAS LIKE, FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S NOT. THAT'S A PUNCH, WHAT YOU DID. THAT'S A PUNCH. HE'S LIKE, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD DUCK. WELL, YOU THOUGHT WRONG, AND YOU ALSO JUST GOT DOCKED. I DEDUCTED AN AMOUNT. THAT'S ABOUT IT.
Jon: NO, I THINK THAT'S WISE. WELL, VERY NICE. IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE COME BACK AND SEE US.
I HAVE TO, MAN!
Jon: THE MOVIE, "THINK LIKE A MAN TOO," IT'S IN THE THEATERS ON FRIDAY.
YES!
THE ALWAYS WONDERFUL KEVIN HART.
THANK YOU, MAN.
