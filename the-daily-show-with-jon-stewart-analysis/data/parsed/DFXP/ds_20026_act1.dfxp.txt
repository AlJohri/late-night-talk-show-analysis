FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ♪
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THIS IS EXCITING. A YOUNG MAN NAMED BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH IS GOING TO JOIN US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GREAT FILM. IT'S A GREAT FILM, AND HE'S GREAT IN IT. BUT FIRST IT'S BEEN A ROUGH YEAR FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES. THE RISE OF ISIS. A MIDTERM SHELLACKING. THE FAILURE TO GET EVEN ONE CHAIR TO TURN AROUND ON "THE VOICE." JUST ONE! COME ON GWEN, TURN AROUND! BARACK IS SINGING! BUT AS THE PRESIDENT SAID IN HIS "VOICE" AUDITION SONG ♪ THE SUN WILL COME OUT --
A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR OBAMA CARE ON SATURDAY, THE VERY FIRST DAY OF THE LATEST DAY OF THE RECENT OPEN ENROLLMENT.
THE CONSUMER HAS A BETTER INTERACTION. THINGS ARE SIMPLER, FASTER AND MORE INTUITIVE.
Jon: OBAMACARE WEBSITE IS BETTER. FOR EXAMPLE, NOW WHEN YOU LOG INTO THE NEW HEALTHCARE.GOV IT OFFERS YOU A CHOICE OF INSURANCE OPTIONS RATHER THAN BRUNCH OPTIONS FOR A DENNYS IN KALAMAZOO.  ALSO THE NEW WEBSITE LOADS QUICKLY. WHEREAS THE OLD SITE WOULD CUT THE BRAKES IN YOUR CAR. SHE'S TERRIFIED. AGAIN IT'S A BIG IMPROVEMENT. I BET ALL ANYONE IN WASHINGTON DC WILL TALK ABOUT THESE AMAZING SUCCESS OF OBAMACARE.
ALL ANYONE IN WASHINGTON IS TALKING ABOUT IS A TAPE THAT EMERGED RECENTLY OF AN OBAMACARE CONSULTANT TELLING FOLKS WHAT HE REALLY THINKS ABOUT THE AMERICANS BUYING THE INSURANCE.
Jon: OH, I BET HE THINKS THEY'RE REALLY NEAT. [LAUGHING] ACTUALLY THEY'RE RETPEFRG TO OBAMA CARE CONSULTANT JON GRUBER. THAT'S ACTUALLY JON GRUDEN. THAT'S FORMER BUCK'S COACH JOHN GRUDEN. THAT'S JOHN McCLANE'S NEMESIS HANS GRUBER. THAT'S JUST A -- THAT'S JUST A POPULAR CINEMA SNACK, GOOBERS. THAT'S -- THANK YOU. SO WHAT DID THIS GUY SAY ABOUT OBAMACARE?
IT'S A VERY CLEVER, YOU KNOW, BASIC EXPLOITATION OF THE LACK OF ECONOMIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE AMERICAN VOTER. THEY PROPOSED IT AND THAT PASSED. BECAUSE THE AMERICAN VOTERS ARE TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE.
Jon: WHAT, HOW, WHAT! WHAT! HOW DARE THIS GRUBER! SAY AMERICANS ARE STUPID. [LAUGHING] WE CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE SEVEN SUBTLY DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF COMBOS. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ALL JUST BASICALLY HOLLOWED OUT LINCOLN LOGS SOMEONE JIZZED IN. I'M SORRY, I MEAN PRETZELS WITH CHEESE. WHO IS THIS JERK, GRUBER ANYWAYS ?
JONATHAN GRUBER IS AN ECONOMICS PROFESSOR.
Jon: EGGHEAD.
HE HAS SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE IN ACADEMIA.
Jon: SUPER EGGHEAD. NERD PUNCHING ARM ACTIVATE.
GRUBER WORKS IN MASSACHUSETS.
Jon: TAXACHUSETS! SUPER TAXACHUSETS EGGHEAD! ALL WE NEED TO WIN PROGRESSIVE BOOGEYMAN BINGO IS FOR THIS MAN TO HAVE THE PINCHED NASAL TONE OF CLASSIC MOVIE NERD, EDDIE DEEZEN.
BOY ARE YOU GUYS DUMB. THAT SYSTEM PROBABLY CONTAINS A NEW DATA ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM.
Jon: WELL? DOES HE?
THIS BILL WAS WRITTEN IN A TORTURED WAY TO MAKE SURE CBO DID NOT SCORE THE MANDATE AS TAXES. IF CBO SCORED THE MANDATE AS TAXES, THE BILL DIES. LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IS A HUGE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE. AND BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, CALL IT THE STUPIDITY OF THE AMERICAN VOTER, OR WHATEVER. BUT BASICALLY THAT WAS REALLY, REALLY CRITICAL TO GET ANYTHING TO PASS. [LAUGHING]
Jon: HOLY [BEEP]! [LAUGHING] SO THIS GUY EDDIE DEEZEN,  I MEAN GRUBER. THIS GUY SAYS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE PURPOSELY MISLEAD ABOUT OBAMACARE. WELL LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION. WHO THE [BEEP] IS HE? BY A COMPLETE PERIPHERAL PLAYER. President: WE HAVE DRAWN SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST MINDS OF ACADEMIA AND POLICY CIRCLES. MANY OF THEM I HAVE STOLEN IDEAS FROM LIBERALLY. PEOPLE FROM ROBERT GORDON TO AUSTAN GOOLSBEE AND JON GRUBER.
HE ATTENDED FIVE OF THE TWELVE MEETINGS AT THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE IN 2009 INCLUDING THE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT.
WHEN THE BILL WAS BEING WRITTEN THE ADMINISTRATION PAID GRUBER ALMOST $400,000 FOR TECHNICAL ADVICE ON DRAFTING THE LAW.
Jon: THE WHITE HOUSE CAFETERIA HAS A SANDWICH NOW CALLED THE GRUBERGER. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS A NECKLACE IT'S A BROKEN MEDALLION. THE OTHER HALF OF THAT MEDALLION RESIDES ON THE PERSON OF ONE JON GRUBER. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT AND JON GRUBER TALKING ABOUT OBAMA CARE OVER LUNCH. [LAUGHING] SO, I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU HOW THAT ENDS. SO THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP TOLD US, THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP TOLD US THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS NOT A TAX EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW IT WAS A TAX. THAT'S PRETTY SLIMY. I GUESS ALL THEY CAN DO NOW IS GO BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SAY, ALRIGHT. WE MISLED YOU. IT WAS FOR THE GREATER GOOD. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR PARENTS TELL YOU THAT YOUR DOG MR. MITTENS DIDN'T DIE HE JUST WENT UPSTATE TO LIVE ON A FARM. BUT YOU DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE BECAUSE APPARENTLY HE HAD A MEETING THERE AT 3:00 IN THE [BLEEP] MORNING. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND YOU NEVER EXPLAINED WHY SCHNAUZERS WERE HAVING A MEETING IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE POINT IS I MISS YOU MR. MITTENS. [LAUGHING]  ALSO I THINK THE DEMOCRATS CAN NOW COME CLEAN ABOUT HOW THE BILL WAS SOLD AND MR. GRUBER'S INVOLVEMENT IN THAT PROCESS. OR --
WE HAVE NEWS HERE IN THE PAST FEW DAYS ABOUT SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY MR. GRUBER.
I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS. [LAUGHING]
Jon: CAN YOU EVER NOT, NOT DISAPPOINT US? YOU DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS.
OUR BILL BRINGS DOWN RATES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN JONATHAN GRUBER OF MIT'S ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE COMPARISON IS TO THE STATUS QUO.
Jon: WHOEVER THAT GUY IS. SO, THAT'S PRETTY LOUSY. POLITICALLY. BUT GRUBER STILL ISN'T DOING ANY STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO THE ACT, UNLESS IN ONE OF HIS CAUGHT ON TAPE RAMBLINGS HE SAID SOMETHING THAT HACKED AWAY AT OBAMACARE'S ACTUAL INNER WORKINGS.
THROUGH A POLITICAL COMPROMISE THE DECISION WAS MADE THAT STATES SHOULD PLAY A CRITICAL ROLL IN RUNNING THE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES. AND THE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES ARE THE CENTERPIECE OF THIS REFORM. IF YOU'RE A STATE AND YOU DON'T SET UP YOUR EXCHANGE, THAT MEANS YOUR CITIZENS DON'T GET THEIR TAX CREDITS.
Jon: OH, BOY. GRUBER HERE SEEMS TO BE SUGGESTING THAT THE LAW ONLY PROVIDES SUBSIDIES TO LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS TO HELP THEM PAY FOR THEIR INSURANCE THROUGH STATE EXCHANGES NOT THE FEDERAL EXCHANGE. AND SINCE THE FEDERAL EXCHANGE COVERS 36 STATES THAT WOULD EFFECTLY SCRAP THE AFFORDABLE PART OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. BUT HERE IS THE THING. THAT'S IF YOU LOOK AT JUST ONE CLAUSE AND IGNORE THE REST OF THE LAW BECAUSE THE ACA ALSO STATES THAT WHEN STATES FAIL TO STEP UP AND CREATE THE REQUIRED EXCHANGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT "SHALL ESTABLISH AND OPERATE SUCH A EXCHANGE WITHIN THE STATE." AND ACCORDING TO A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF NEARLY 50 EXPERTS IN HEALTH ECONOMY, NOTHING IN THE RECORDS SUGGESTS THAT CONGRESS INTENDED THE ECONOMICALLY DISASTROUS APPROACH OF DRAMATICALLY LIMITING SUBSIDIES ONLY TO PARTICIPANTS OF THE STATE EXCHANGES. SO REALLY IT'S A MATTER OF INTERPRETATION. EITHER THE LAW INTENDS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE SUBSIDIES THROUGH STATE EXCHANGES OR CONGRESS INTENTIONALLY WROTE A BILL DESIGNED TO KILL ITSELF. AND SURE, CONGRESS SUCKS. THEY CAN'T SUCK THAT BAD. SO, TO THE REPUBLICANS, YOU'VE TRIED TO KILL THIS LAW EVERY WHICH WAY. 50,000 CONGRESSIONAL REPEALS, DEFUNDING THREATS, LAWSUITS UP THE WAZOO WHICH BY THE WAY, FULLY COVERED NOW UNDER OBAMACARE. YOU KEEP TRYING. BUT NOW YOUR BEST REMAINING MOVE, THE STRONGEST CARD IN THE DECK LOOKS TO BE THE GRUBER. GOOD LUCK GETTING SOMEONE TO TAKE UP A FEDERAL CASE ON THE OFFHANDED AND SOMEWHAT DICKISH COMMENTS OF SOME MIT EGGHEAD.
THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR A CHALLENGE TO OBAMACARE NEXT YEAR THAT COULD INVALIDATE FEDERALLY OPERATED EXCHANGES IN 30 STATES.
OPPONENTS OF THE LAW, YOU KNOW, REALLY SEIZED ON GRUBER'S COMMENTS EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE MADE A YEAR AGO. AND THEY'RE GOING TO USE THAT IN THE SUPREME COURT. [LAUGHING]
Jon: WELL, IN THE WORDS OF A PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT CASE [BEEP] [BEEP] [BEEP] AND TITS. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
