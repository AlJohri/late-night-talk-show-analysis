FROM COMEDY CENTRALS WORLD NEWS HEAD QUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TONIGHT! MY GUEST, A GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF STEPHEN JOHNSON, HE IS AUTHOR OF "HOW WE GOT TO NOW," IT'S A VERY TIMELY BOOK BECAUSE -- IT IS NOW. BREAKING NEWS TODAY!
ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER IS STEPPING DOWN AFTER NEARLY SIX YEARS ON THE JOB.
ERIC HAS AGREED TO STAY ON AS ATTORNEY GENERAL UNTIL I NOMINATE A SUCCESSOR, AND THAT SUCCESSOR IS CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE.
Jon: SO HE WILL NEVER LEAVE! (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS CONGRESS SLOW TO ACT ON ANY IMPORTANT CONFIRMATION HEARINGS CURRENTLY, THEY'RE BUSY (BLEEP) THEIR PANTS.
I.S.I.S. IS A THREAT.
THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HIT US HERE AT HOME.
THEY HAVE KILLED THOUSANDS, THEY ARE MARCHING ON.
WE CAN'T BURY OUR HEADS IN THE SANDS ON THIS.
ACTION MUST BE TAKEN.
THIS PRESIDENT NEEDS TO RISE TO THE OCCASION BEFORE WE ALL GET KILLED BACK HERE AT HOME.
Jon: ALL OF US KILLED! ALL OF US. WE'LL BE THE DEAD AS THE ART OF HOW TO PROPERLY SQUIRE A LADY AT A COTILLION! (LAUGHTER) ALWAYS BRING AN EXTRA PAIR OF GLOVES! FRUIT PUNCH CAN SPILL! (LAUGHTER) SO IF YOU'RE FACING AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT URGING THE PRESIDENT TO ACT, BUT I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION CONGRESS COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, LIKE DECLARE WAR.
IF CONGRESS IS SUCH AN EQUAL PARTNER AS IT IS, WHY NOT WRITE A RESOLUTION OF YOUR OWN.
TYPICALLY IN MY TIME HERE IN CONGRESS, THAT'S NOT HOW THIS HAS HAPPENED. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD REQUEST THAT SUPPORT AND WOULD SUPPLY THE WORDING OF A RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE THIS FORCE. AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME, WE'VE NOT GOTTEN THAT REQUEST, WE'VE NOT SEEN THAT LANGUAGE.
Jon: WE WOULD LOVE TO HELP STOP THE GREATEST THREAT THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER KNOWN -- BUT NOT IF IT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO BE RUDE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE RUDE. THAT WOULD BE GAUCHE. BUT AT LEAST CONGRESS CAN AGREE ON ONE THING -- I'M JUST KIDDING. THEY CAN'T. (LAUGHTER)
THE PRESIDENT HAS THE AUTHORITY HE NEEDS NOW TO ACT AGAINST I.S.I.S.
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD COME TO CONGRESS AND ASK FOR AUTHORIZATION.
THE PRESIDENT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO IMMEDIATELY ACT.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS TO COME TO CONGRESS.
I BELIEVE HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO MOVE ON IT.
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE SEEKING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL, PERIOD.
Jon: IT'S SO HEARTENING TO SEE CONGRESS USUALLY SO GRID LOCKED ALONG PARTISAN LINES FINALLY REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE AND COMING TOGETHER TO GET NOTHING DONE. (LAUGHTER) OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON HERE?
I THINK AT SOME POINT IN TIME, WHEN WE COME BACK, AFTER THE ELECTIONS, I THINK THERE WILL BE A CONSIDERATION OF A LARGER AUTHORIZATION FOR THE USE OF FORCE.
Jon: AFTER THE MIDTERMS. WE'LL DO IT AFTER THE MIDTERMS! WE DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE COUNTRY'S EXISTENTIAL THREAT UNTIL CONGRESS DEALS WITH ITS EXISTENTIAL THREAT. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED CONSTITUTIONAL CONUNDRUM WHICH JAMES MADISON IN FEDERALIST #51 REFERRED TO AS A TOTAL PIG (BLEEP). WHICH BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT HAS THE POWER TO TO TAKE US TO WAR? IS THIS EVEN A WAR AT ALL? AND IF IT ISN'T A WAR, WHAT IS IT? NOW IS THE TIME FOR AN ADULT CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW OUR GOVERNMENT MAKES ITS MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS AND FUNCTIONS IN CRISIS. AND TO LEAD THAT DISCUSSION I GIVE YOU OUR NATIONAL MEDIA.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SO-CALLED LATE SALUTE.
HOLDING A CUP IN HIS RIGHT HAND.
THE GREAT COFFEE ESCAPADE.
COFFEEGATE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IN HOT WATER.
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT WAS DISRESPECTFUL.
HASHTAG LATTE SALUTE.
THE COFFEE SALUTE WENT VIRAL.
THE LATTE IS BLOWING UP ONLINE.
Jon: WE ARE SO (BLEEP). I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO. (LAUGHTER) FIRST OF ALL, WE'RE CURRENTLY FIGHTING, IF I MAY SAY, SO APPARENTLY WE'RE CURRENTLY FIGHTING I.S.I.S. AND EBOLA, TWO THINGS THAT ARE LITERALLY BLOWING UP AND GOING VIRAL. SO, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COVER THE IMPORTANT STUFF, AT LEAST DON'T USE WORDS THAT REMIND US OF THE IMPORTANT STUFF YOU'RE NOT COVERING. OK, NOW TO BE FAIR, LATTE GATE WASN'T ALL THE NEWS TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY. BUT WHERE I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN THE PRESIDENT'S SALUTE WITH COFFEE CUP AN ESPRESSO-SIZED SHOT OF ATTENTION, THE NEWS CHANNELS WENT FOR THE FULL DOUBLE VENTI COVERAGE WITH ONE NETWORK GOING ESPECIALLY DEEP.
LEARN THE PROPER RESPECT OF THE SALUTE.
IT'S INSENSITIVE.
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF IT? THAT'S IT.
IT LOOKS TERRIBLE.
IT'S OUTLANDISH, AND IT'S DISAPPOINTING.
PUT YOUR COFFEE IN THE OTHER HAND.
OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF DISPLAYED HIS COMPLETE DISRESPECT FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM --
Jon: SHUT UP! YOU DON'T REALLY CARE! YOU DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS! YOU HAVE NO PRINCIPLE ABOUT THIS. YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SCORE POINTS IN A GAME THAT NOBODY ELSE IS PLAYING. HERE'S HOW WE KNOW.
IT'S AN ARROGANCE THAT HE PORTRAYS. THESE PEOPLE HAVE PUT THEY'RE LIVES ON THE LINE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHOW THE RESPECT, SALUTE THESE GUYS.
Jon: SO THE PRINCIPLE HERE IS SHOW RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR THIS FIGHT. HERE'S ERIC BOLLING ON THAT VERY SAME EPISODE.
THE FIRST FEMALE PILOT PILOTING FOR THE U.A.E. DROPPED THE BOMBS ON I.S.I.S. ON MONDAY NIGHT.
WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED BOOBS ON THE GROUND? OR NO? (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, FORGET THE RAMPANT SEXISM IN THAT STATEMENT. SECOND OF ALL, SHE'S A PILOT, SO WHATEVER GENDER SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT SHE MIGHT BE CARRYING IS IN THE (BLEEP) AIR. AND THIRDLY,  WHAT WAS THE QUOTE THAT SOMEONE SAID EARLIER IN THE PROGRAM? THESE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US, SHOW RESPECT. SO (BLEEP) YOU AND ALL YOUR FALSE PATRIOTISM. WHEN BUSH TOOK US TO WAR, ANY CRITICISM WAS SHOUTED DOWN AS TREASONOUS. WHEN BUSH TOOK US TO WAR, ANY CRITICISM WAS SHOUTED DOWN AS TREASONOUS. BUT THE PRESIDENT YOU DON'T LIKE, HAS THE COUNTRY POISED ON THE SAME PRECIPICE, NO TRANSGRESSION NO MATTER HOW IMMATERIAL OR RIDICULOUS IS TOO SMALL TO CITE AS EVIDENCE THAT THIS PRESIDENT ISN'T AS AMERICAN AS YOU ARE. YOU WANT A HOT CUP OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE, WATCH THIS.
WOULD PRESIDENT BUSH EVER DO THAT?
YEAH ARE WE SURPRISED? I MEAN, AFTER ALL WE'VE GOT A CHAI SWILLING, GOLF-PLAYING, BASKETBALL, TRASH-TALKING LEADING-FROM-BEHIND, I-GOT-NO-STRATEGY, OSAMA BIN LADEN-IS-DEAD, GM IS ALIVE, COMMUNITY ORGANIZING COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, HOW DISRESPECTFUL WAS THAT?
Jon: YEAH, YEAH NOW WHILE PALIN IN A BALD CAP WAS FEEDING US A STEAMING BOWL OF LIBERAL EPITHETS, HE DRINKS CHAI SO THAT MEANS WHEN HE SUCKS (BLEEP) IN THE BACK OF A VOLVO IT HAS THAT CARDAMOM ZING. BUT IN THEIR HASTE, THEY FORGOT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, WOULD PRESIDENT BUSH EVER SALUTE THE TROOPS WITH A CUP OF COFFEE IN HIS HAND? AND THE ANSWER IS NO, BECAUSE HIS HANDS WERE TOO FILLED WITH DOG, A SCOTTY, OUT OF RESPECT.  (APPLAUSE) SO HERE WE'VE GOT TWO PRESIDENTS BOTH SENDING THE UNITED STATES TO WAR, CITING THE SAME LEGAL AUTHORITIES, BOTH WITHOUT ANY SEEMING EXIT STRATEGY, AND BOTH HOLDING  (BLEEP) IN THEIR HANDS WHILE SALUTING TROOPS, BUT IN THEIR DISEASED MINDS, ONLY ONE DID IT BECAUSE HE LOVED AMERICA, THE OTHER DID IT BECAUSE HE HATED IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
