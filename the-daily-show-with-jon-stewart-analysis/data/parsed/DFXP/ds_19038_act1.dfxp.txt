FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME JON STEWART. MAN -- MAN HAVE WE PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM TONIGHT. THE GUEST IS FORMER CEO OF BLACKWATER, FORMERLY KNOWN AS BLACKWATER. ERIK PRINCE WILL BE HERE. HE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT IT. WE'LL HAVE A BUDGET DEAL IN PLACE BEFORE WE KNOW WHO HAS WON THE VOICE. PLEASE LET IT BE KELLY CLARKSON. I HOPE IT'S KELLY CLARKSON. AM I TOO LATE? [LAUGHTER] AT LEAST WE'LL HAVE ONE BEFORE CONGRESS GOES ON VACATION, HOLIDAY SEX TOURISM. [LAUGHTER] BUT, OF COURSE, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED THEIR VERSION OF BUDGET DEAL WITH JOHN BOEHNER PLAYING A CRITICAL ROLE IN VOTE WRANGLING WHICH HAS WON HIM A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT.
I THINK JOHN BOEHNER IS ONE OF PRIME EXAMPLES OF WORTHLESS, WORTHLESS REPUBLICANS.
DEMOCRAT LIGHT.
THE SPEAKER IS ABSURD.
THE SPEAKER HAS DEMONSTRATED A POVERTY OF LEADERSHIP.
HE JUST GOT 332 VOTES.
HE GOT 332 VOTES BECAUSE HE GOT THE DEMOCRATS TO VOTE WITH HIM.
Jon: THE DEMOCRATS, BLECK -- [LAUGHTER] WHEN DID THE DEMOCRATS BECOME TO THE REPUBLICANS WHAT PORK IS TO THE DEVOUT. THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT UNCLEAN. BOEHNER HELPED BROKER THE MOST BASIC OF COMPROMISES TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONING AT ITS CURRENT INCREDIBLY PATHETIC LEVEL. WITH A PROMISE OF NO SHUTDOWN FOR A COUPLE YEARS. IT WOULD BE LIKE IF MAYOR ROB FORD'S NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION WAS I PROMISE TO MAINTAIN OUR PRESENT LEVEL OF CRACK SMOKING.
HOUSE SPEAKER BOEHNER SEEMS TO HAVE HAD ENOUGH.
IT'S ON.
YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE HIM ANGRY. YOU WOULDN'T LIKE BOEHNER WHEN HE IS ANGRY. [LAUGHTER]
BOEHNER MAD.
SO MAD BOEHNER GETS SAD. [LAUGHTER] THAT SOUNDED LIKE WE DUBBED IN SANTA THERE. COME ON JOHN BOEHNER ELOQUENTLY DEFEND YOUR POSITION. YOU ARE THE HOUSE SPEAKER, SPEAK.
THEY PUSHED US INTO THE FIGHT TO DEFUND OBAMACARE AND SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT. THE DAY BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT REOPENED, ONE OF PEOPLE AT -- ONE OF THESE GROUPS STOOD UP AND SAID WELL, WE NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT WAS AN AWFULLY ABRUPT EMOTIONAL CHANGE. TALKING REGULARLY AND SUDDENLY A THUNDERSTORM ROLLED IN. WELL WE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD -- ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THAT WAS PROWRESTLING LEVEL RHETORIC. CLEARLY BOEHNER IS TRYING TO MAKE A CATCH PHRASE HAPPEN. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. I MEAN THESE TEA PARTYERS ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THEY MAKE JOE BIDEN LOOK LIKE STEPHEN   HAWKING. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. THERE'S MERCH OUT BACK FOR THOSE WHO ENJOYED THE SHOW. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? [LAUGHTER] YOU MIGHT BE KIDDING ME! [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT? CONSERVATIVES HAVE NEVER LIKED JOHN BOEHNER THAT'S WHY THEY PUNISHED HIM BY MAKING HIM SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FOR FOUR YEARS. YOU KNOW WHO THEY LOVE PAUL RYAN. HE WAS THE COAUTHOR OF THE NEW BUDGET AGREEMENT. TEA PARTY DARLING, FORMER VP CANDIDATE ALL WRAPPED UP IN THE LOOKS OF A GOLDEN CHILD WHOSE FISCAL GENIUS WILL LEAD US TO THE PROMISED LAND WHERE REAGAN WILL RISE ONCE MORE. AND HE WILL COME AGAIN IN GLORY TO JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD THOUGH REALLY FOR THE DEAD THEY ARE ALREADY DEAD SO -- IT'S REALLY FOR THE LIVING. MY POINT IS THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] CONSERVATIVES LIKE PAUL RYAN.
YOU CALLED FOR MORE LEADERS. PAUL RYAN HAS LED.
HE HAS LED TO MAKE A COMPROMISE THAT SELLS OUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.
YOU CALLED PAUL RYAN A SELLOUT.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
Jon: YOU KNOW THAT SENATOR WHO APPEARS TO HAVE JUST WOKEN UP ON A PARK BENCH IS RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T SAY PAUL RYAN WAS A SELLOUT I JUST SAID HE SOLD OUT. IF YOU EXCUSE ME I'M GOING TO BATHE IN THE POND AT CENTRAL PARK. [LAUGHTER] RYAN STOOD FAST TO HIS ETHIC OF COMPROMISE.
DID YOU EVER THINK A PIECE OF LEGISLATION YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR WOULD BE CALLED NOT CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH?
IT'S A STRANGE NEW NORMAL, ISN'T IT? GROUPS WILL DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.
Jon: THAT IS THE NERDIEST VERSION OF HATERS GONNA HATE I HAVE EVER HEARD. GROUPS ARE GOING TO DO IT. I BELIEVE THOSE WITH AN UNFAIR NEGATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON EVENTS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE NEGATIVE PERSPECTIVE. REGARDLESS AND THOSE RELATIONSHIPS TAKE PRIORITIES OVER THOSE WITH COURTESANS. JOHN BOEHNER ISN'T CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH FOR THE TEA PARTY. WHO IS?
PERHAPS ANOTHER WARNING SHOT FOR THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT. TEXAS CONGRESSMAN STEVE STOCKMAN A TEA PARTY FAVORITE THREW HIS HAT INTO THE RING FOR NEXT YEAR'S SENATE RACE IN A PRIMARY CHALLENGE AGAINST INCUMBENT SENATOR JOHN CORNYN.
Jon: HE'S NOT CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH?
THIS GUY?
JON OPENED UP GOVERNMENT, GAVE SUPPORT TO SOLDIERS AND ROOTED OUT CROOKS. ROSE TO THE TOP IN JUST ONE TERM, KEPT TEXAS IN POWER, MADE LESSER STATES SQUIRM. BIG JOHN.
Jon: THAT GUY? THE GUY HAS GOTTEN HIGH MARKS FROM THE GROUPS LIKE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION, THE NATIONAL JOURNAL NAMED HIM THE SECOND MOST CONSERVATIVE SENATOR BEHIND ONLY ALASKA'S REPRESENTATIVE PAINTING OF JESUS DRILLING FOR OIL. [LAUGHTER] SOMEONE IS GOING TO COMMISSION THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'LL TELL YOU WHAT GIVE ME A TASTE OF THIS STEVE STOCKMAN GUY. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS CONSIDERED TEA PARTY ELECTABLE THESE DAYS. IT'S AMAZING WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS COVERED BY OBAMACARE. IF YOU DECIDE TO BECOME TRANSGENDER YOU CAN GET THAT COVERED.
GOOD TO KNOW.
NEXT TIME I CALL YOUR SHOW -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I GET IT BECAUSE -- IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE HE IS AN (bleep). AT THIS POINT THE ONLY GUY THAT COULD LIVE UP TO THE IDEALS IS RONALD REAGAN HIMSELF.
RONALD REAGAN BROUGHT ABOUT OBAMA'S ELECTION. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT POLITICAL HERO RONALD REAGAN TRIED TO DO WITH THREE MILLION ILLEGALS.
REAGAN BOTCHED IT THOUGH.
EXACTLY THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
WE HAVE TO STOP WORSHIPING RONALD REAGAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HOLY (bleep) WHEN RONALD REAGAN IS JUST ANOTHER HOLLYWOOD LIBERAL YOU HAVE TO SAY TO YOUR PARTY ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
