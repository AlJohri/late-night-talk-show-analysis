(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. OH, THE HOLIDAY SEASON, 'TIS THE SEASON. THE HOLIDAYS ARE UPON US WHICH MEANS WE HEAR AT THE DAILY SHOW TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE  NEEDIEST AMONG US: GIANT ON-LINE RETAILERS. THEY'RE SUFFERING AND NOWHERE IS THE SITUATION MORE HEART BREAKING THAN IN CALIFORNIA. JOHN OLIVER HAS MORE.
Reporter: CALIFORNIA IS IN TROUBLE. THEY'RE FACING A FINANCIAL ARMAGEDDON. AND IT'S LARGELY BECAUSE OF ONE THING. DIRECT DEMOCRACY.
THEY THROW ISSUES ON THE BALLOTS AND PEOPLE VOTE FOR THEM WITHOUT ACTUALLY KNOWING  WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS ARE.
WE HEAR THAT DIRECT DEMOCRACY IS ON WONDERFUL BUT WHAT IF IT'S NOT.
Reporter: WITH JUST 500,000 SIGNATURES CALIFORNIANS CAN PUT ANYTHING ON THE BALLOT  RIGHT PAST THE LEGISLATURE AND MAKE IT LAW. IT'S A DIFFICULT SYSTEM TO UNDERSTAND UNTIL YOU TALK TO STATE DEMOCRATIC CHAIRMAN JOHN BURDEN.
IT'S TOTALLY (BEEP) UP. IT WAS PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. IT'S NOW BECOME A TOOL OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS TO SCREW THE PEOPLE.
Reporter: I'M NOT SURE IT'S NOT AS BAD AS YOU'RE SAYING.
IT'S GIVE YOU A REAL (BEEP) EXAMPLE. THE TEAM (BEEP) BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE SCHOOL, NOT ENOUGH MONEY  FOR STATE SERVICES.
Reporter: HE'S TALKING ABOUT PROPOSITION 13 WHICH MANDATES THE PROPERTY TAXES  CANNOT BE RAISED MEANING THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THINGS LIKE  PROPOSITION 98 WHICH MANDATES THAT CALIFORNIANS DRAMATICALLY INCREASE SPENDING ON EDUCATION. SO THE STATE PASSED A LAW SAYING THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THINGS THAT FE PASSED A  LAW REQUIRING THEMSELVES TO PAY FOR.
PEOPLE SAY HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED? WELL, IT HAPPENED BECAUSE THEY BOUGHT A BAG OF BULL (BEEP) AND VOTED FOR IT.
Reporter: YOU CUSS MORE THAN A WEST COAST RAPPER.
WHO?
Reporter: BUT CALIFORNIA HAS A SOLUTION TO REDUCE ITS $26 BILLION DEFICIT, A NEW LAW  REQUIRING ALL E-COMMERCE COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON.COM TO PAY STATE SALES TAX. WHAT DID AMAZON DO?
AMAZON LAUNCHED AN EXPENSIVE CAMPAIGN TO OVERTURN THE LAW THROUGH A BALLOT MEASURE.
Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT AMAZON.COM IS USING-- WHAT ELSE? -- BUT DIRECT DEMOCRACY  PAYING FIRMS TO COLLECT NAMES AT $3 PER SIGNATURE. ITS DEMOCRACY AT ITS FINEST. ACCORDING TO REPUBLICAN STATE ASSEMBLYMAN TIM DONNELLY.
THIS IS FREEDOM. FREEDOM TAKES ON MANY FORMS.
Reporter: WHAT ARE YOU SAY TO GO THE CRITICISMS THAT THIS IS BEING HIJACKED AS A PROCESS  BY MAJOR COMPANIES?
IN THIS CASE THE LITTLE GUYS ARE STANDING ON AMAZON'S SHOULDERS. THEY'RE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT? WE JUST WANT TO BREATHE SOME FREE AIR.
Reporter: THAT'S NOT OVERSTATING IT?
NO. I NEVER OVERSTATE IT. THE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PAY ILLEGAL TAXES. THEY CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO PAY ILLEGAL TAXES THAT WILL BE USED TO SUBSIDIZE ILLEGALS. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
Reporter: HOW CAN YOU GET AN AMAZON SALES TAX BACK TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
IN I CAN TIE ANYTHING TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
Reporter: WHAT IF I WERE TO SUGGEST AN INITIATIVE THAT MAY 31 SHOULD FOREVER BE REFERRED  TO AS TIM DONNELLY IS AN (BEEP) DAY? I MEAN, I WOULD NEED 500,000 SIGNATURES.
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE THAT HARD IN THIS STATE.
Reporter: I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE. IT SEEMS A VIRTUAL CERTAINTY THAT AMAZON WILL BE PAYING NO SALES TAX IN CALIFORNIA NEXT YEAR. WHY CAN'T PEOPLE BE HAPPY WITH THIS VICTORY FOR THE BIG LITTLE MAN?
THE (BEEP) SHOULD AMAZON ESCAPE WHAT WE'RE SHUTTING DOWN SCHOOLS, SHUTTING DOWN  HOSPITALS, FIRING TEACHERS AND COPS AND FIREMEN, SCREWING MENTAL HEALTH PEOPLE BECAUSE  THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A GOD- DAMNED SALES TACK LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
Reporter: IT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM. YOU WORK HARD. YOU MAKE BILLIONS AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE A VOICE.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.
Reporter: IT'S WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS BUILT ON.
MY DAUGHTER GAVE ME A KINDLE FOR MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT. AND I WILL NOT USE IT BECAUSE OF THESE GOD-DAMNED PEOPLE AT AMAZON. I GO TO MY BOOKSTORE AND BUY A GOD-DAMNED BOOK AND READ IT. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. I CAN READ IT TAKING A CRAP AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING AT A KINDLE OR A COMPUTER TAKING A CRAP.
Reporter: OKAY. CLEARLY THE DIRECT DEMOCRACY SYSTEM IS SLIGHTLY FLAWED BUT HOW DO YOU FIX IT?
YOU COULD FIX IT SEVERAL WAYS. TO QUALIFY AN INITIATIVE THE STATUTORY INITIATIVE IS 5% OF THOSE WHO VOTED AT THE LAST  GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION.
Reporter: HOLD ON, HOLD ON. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP 500,000 SIGNATURES FORCING LEGISLATION THROUGH IS TO GET 500,000  SIGNATURES TO STOP IT?
EXACTLY. (BEEP).
Reporter: IT SEEMS ONLY CALIFORNIA VOTERS CAN SAVE THEMSELVES FROM THEMSELVES. WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN SIGNING AN INITIATIVE TO ASK PEOPLE TO STOP BEING ASKED FOR SIGNATURES?
YES.
Reporter: YOU'RE AGAINST DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
Reporter: THERE'S NO NICE WAY OF SAYING THIS. CALIFORNIA IS... WHAT'S THE WORD?
(BEEP).
Reporter: EXACTLY.
Jon: JOHN
