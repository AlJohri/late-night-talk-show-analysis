Jon: WELCOME BACK! YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE INSIDE TIP, YOU KNOW, THE LINGO OF THE BUSINESS, BUT A LITTLE THING IN THE NEWS BUSINESS, WE CALL IT TEASE, A TEASER. YOU WANT TO ENTICE VIEWERS TO WATCH THE NEXT SEGMENT. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP THEM THERE THROUGH THE COMMERCIAL. SO YOU WANT TO ENTICE THEM WITHOUT GIVING AWAY WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
LATER IN THE WAKE OF THE NEW YORK GRAND JURY DECISION NOT TO INDICT AN NYPD OFFICER IN THE DEATH OF ERIC GARNER, THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK ANDREW CUOMO THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO TAKE SOME ADVICE FROM A GUY THAT ADMITS THAT HE SOLD CRACK AND WAS A DRUG DEALER AND ACTUALLY SHOT SOMEBODY, AND WE'LL TELL YOU WHO IT IS AS WE CONTINUE-- . (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THIS IS GOING TO DRIVE ME CRAZY. I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS! I'M GOING GO WITH JAY Z? YOU KNOW, CAUSE OF THE PHOTO OF JAY Z? YOU HAVE UP ON THE SCREEN THERE FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. OR PERHAPS THAT'S JUST PART OF THE INTRICATE MISDIRECT. BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN MR. HANNITY'S DESCRIPTION OF MR. Z.
A GUY THAT ADMITS THAT HE SOLD CRACK AND WAS A DRUG DEALER AND ACTUALLY SHOT SOMEBODY.
Jon: SO THAT'S THE TEASE. JAY Z, CRACK DEALER. TELL US MORE.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JAY Z, LET'S GO TO HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY. I SOLD CRACK TO ADDICTS WHO WERE KILLING THEMSELVES, COLLECTING THE WRINKLED BILLS THEY GOT FROM GOD KNOWS WHERE AND MAKING SURE THEY GOT THEIR ROCKS TO SMOKE. WHY WOULD THE GOVERNOR PICK HIM? HE CAN'T DO BETTER THAN THE FORMER CRACK DEALER?
Jon: [BLEEP] MAN, LIKE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO HERE. IT'S SO OVER THE LINE. IT'S SO --
JON, JON, JON STOP IT.
Jon: WHAT THE, JESSICA WILLIAMS!
HI. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HOW DID YOU-- WHAT DID YOU-- HOW DID -- OH ARE YOU HOT?
YEAH.
Jon: I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE HOT.
I'M A HOT MAMA.
Jon: OH YOU ARE A HOT MAMA. NO, I WAS, I WAS JUST TRYING TO --
YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS, I SENSED THAT YOU NEEDED SOME HELP.
Jon: I DO. I MEAN CRACK DEALER, JAY Z --
SHH. NUH-UH, JON. STOP.
Jon: OH, ARE YOU ALRIGHT? ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S ALL RIGHT. MOMMA'S HERE.
Jon: ALRIGHT. I MEAN --
ON THIS CHAIR.
Jon: HOW YOU CAN SAY THAT ABOUT JAY-Z? ALL THAT HE HAS DONE FOR HIMSELF. HE IS NOW THE ILLEST LYRICIST.
WOAH, OKAY, NUH-UH, STAY IN YOUR LANE, OLD MAN.
Jon: YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD CHECK MYSELF.
OKAY, SHUT IT DOWN, STOP, STOP.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST --
BUT ARE YOU RIGHT, JON. HOVA HAS DONE QUITE A FEW OTHER THINGS SINCE HIS DEALING DAYS. YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAVE IMPRESSED PEOPLE ON FOX BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH THEY LIKE TO PREACH TO BLACK FOLKS ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY AND SELF-IMPROVEMENT AND ABOUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE BLACK COMMUNITY.
BLACK PEOPLE NEED TO STEP UP AND START ACTING LIKE FIRST CLASS CITIZENS.
TO DAVID'S POINT WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, THERE SIMPLY IS NO FATHER IN THE FAMILY.
YOU HAD ME ON THE FACT THAT BLACK PEOPLE HAVE TO CLEAN UP THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES.
WHAT HE NEVER MENTIONED WAS THE OUT OF WEDLOCK BIRTH RATE IS OVER 70%.
THE DESERTION RATE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN, ASTRONOMICAL.
THIS PRESIDENT COULD BE A PHENOMENAL ROLE MODEL WITHIN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO SAY GET MARRIED, STAY MARRIED, BE THERE FOR YOUR KIDS.
THEY NEED TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE WITH THE LAW. THEY NEED TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE WITH THE LAW, THEY NEED TO PULL UP THEIR PANTS AND FINISH SCHOOL.
I MEAN, LOOK, JON, IF YOU GO OVER THEIR BLACK MALE TO DO LIST JAY Z HAS IT COVERED. GOOD JOB, CHECK, STABLE MARRIAGE, CHECK. I MEAN, YEAH, I MEAN SURE IT HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS, KIND OF LIKE AN ELEVATOR. IS HE A GOOD FATHER, CHECK. AND HE'S NOT JUST PULLING HIS PANTS UP, THE GUY ACTUALLY SELLS BELTS. THAT'S HOW DEVOTED HE IS TO THE CAUSE OF RAISED PANTS! (APPLAUSE)
Jon: IT'S TRUE.
JON, JAY Z IS THE GUY THEY KEEP SAYING THEY WANT ALL OTHER BLACK GUYS TO BE. BUT TO THEM HE'S STILL JUST A CRACK DEALER.
Jon: AND IT IS APPALLING. AND HIS WIFE IS THIS POWERHOUSE --
OKAY, STOP. NO, STOP, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO ADD ABOUT HER. DO NOT BRING HER INTO THIS. THE ONLY THING I CAN IMAGINE IS THAT FOX HAS A NEW RULE WHERE PEOPLE MUST BE LABELED ACCORDING TO THE WORST THING THEY'VE EVER DONE. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIX SOME CHYRONS ON FOX NEWS. SO LET'S START WITH OJ DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN, HE HAD HAS BEEN ON FOX A LOT SINCE FERGUSON BUT THEY ALWAYS FORGET TO LABEL HIM PROPERLY. AND WHAT ABOUT RUSH LIMBAUGH, THE CONSERVATIVE PATRON SAINT? HE IS NOT JUST A RADIO HOST NOW. HE IS A PRESCRIPTION DRUG ADDICT.
Jon: YOU KNOW IT SEEMS HARDLY FAIR TO DO THIS, THOUGH?
WHY NOT?
Jon: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S FINE. (APPLAUSE)
AND REMEMBER, JON, THEY'RE CALLING JAY Z A CRACK DEALER NOT BECAUSE HE WAS CONVICTED. HE JUST TALKED ABOUT IT IN HIS MUSIC SO, BY THAT STANDARD THEN THEIR BOY TED NUGENT DEFINITELY NEEDS A NEW CREDIT. (LAUGHTER) WE KNOW, WE KNOW THAT OLLIE NORTH DID TERRIBLE THINGS FOR REAGAN AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THIS BALD MOTHER [BLEEP] IS BUT HE CLEARLY HAS A RAP SHEET LONGER THAN ANY RAPPERS.
Jon: NO, NO, NO. THAT IS ACTUALLY G. GORDON LIDDY WAS A WATERGATE CO-CONSPIRATOR --
STOP IT. STOP IT. I'M ALREADY BORED. STOP IT, STOP IT.
Jon: FROM THE '70s. OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA STAY IN MY LANE.
STOP. OKAY, STAY IN YOUR LANE. JON-- .
Jon: O -- H TO THE O --
IN YOUR LANE, IN YOUR LANE.
Jon: THAT'S GOOD. I'M GOOD. EVERYTHING IS GOOD.
DON'T HURT YOURSELF. IS IT, THOUGH? HERE'S WHAT I'M SAYING, JON. FOX NEWS HAS 99 PROBLEMS BUT JAY Z AIN'T ONE.
Jon: THANK YOU, JESSICA WILLIAMS.
THANK YOU.
Jon: JESSICA WILLIAMS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
