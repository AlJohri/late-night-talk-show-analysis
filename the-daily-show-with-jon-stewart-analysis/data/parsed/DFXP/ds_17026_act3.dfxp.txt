HOW DID YOU GUYS FIND HE?
WE WERE SEARCHING THE GUEST HOUSE FOR CLUES WHEN I NOTICED  YOU HAD WRITTEN ON A PAD NEXT TO THE PHONE SO I STARTED TO SHADE  OVER THE IMPRESSION AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED IT WAS A SOUVENIR PENCIL FROM THE HAPPY  SHOPPING GROUNDS! (LAUGHTER) DON'T LET HIM SCARE YOU.
LISTEN, WE DON'T WANT TO BLOW YOUR COVER BUT YOUR MESSAGE WORRIED US.
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVEN'T SAID I MISSED JOY.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW BETTY WHITE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOUNG LADY!
SO NICE TO SEE YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH, THEY'RE CHANGING THEIR NAME OF THE SHOW.
Jon: THEY'RE GONNA. HAT WAS TREMENDOUS..T WHEN THEY STAND LIKE THAT FOR ME I ALWAYS THINK THEY ARE LEAVING.
AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
SO NICE TO SEE YOU, BUT YOU HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE.
Jon: I HAVE?
I'VE JUST BEEN WATCHING THE SHOW SO FAR TONIGHT.
Jon: REALLY.
I MEAN, WELL ALL THESE... YOU KNOW, I... I ALWAYS KIND OF AVOID... I KEEP MY PRIVATE LIFE PRIVATE. BUT I'VE BEEN DOING IT WRONG ALL THIS TIME. AND I'M GOING START NAMING PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT GOING TO NAME HERMAN CAIN AND NEWT GINGRICH AND ALL  THOSE FOLKS BECAUSE DICK CHENEY...
Jon: I'M GOING TO NAME THEM FOR YOU.
WELL, EVERYBODY HAS DONE THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S KIND OF EXCITING THAT I CAN JUST GO... THE ONLY ONE LITTLE DRAWBACK IS I'M GOING TO BE 90 IN JANUARY... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT ISN'T ANYTHING I ACCOMPLISHED. IT JUST HAPPENED. (LAUGHTER) BUT I... WHEN YOU GET TO BE THAT OLD YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THE GUYS YOU'VE HAD. (LAUGHTER) I GO BACK AND THINK I REMEMBER THE WHERE BUT WHO WAS THAT? I THINK I'M GOING TO CHANGE MY WHOLE APPROACH THANKS TO YOU.
Jon: YOU'RE VERY, VERY WELCOME. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD ALWAYS WORK WITH JUST HEAD SHOTS. JUST HAVE THEM LEAVE A HEAD SHOT, PUT IT UP AND THEN YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE IT. LIKE A COMEDY CLUB. THAT'S WHAT WE USED TO DO.
OH, YEAH, THAT'S GOOD. BUT I DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE IT.
Jon: (LAUGHS) I'M EXCITED. YOU GOT YOUR TELEVISION SHOW, THE "HOT IN CLEVELAND." YOU HAVE THIS BOOK YOU'VE WRITTEN. ME, I WORK 22 MINUTES A NIGHT I'M EXHAUSTED. BUT THE BOOK IS... YOU'VE WRITTEN AN EXOTIC COOK BOOK... (LAUGHTER). I GUESS ALL YOUR FAVORITE RECIPES FOR GIRAFFE.
SHAME ON YOU!
Jon: HERE'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS BOOK. SHOW THEM THE PICTURE OF... THIS IS BETTY WHITE WITH... (AUDIENCE REACTS) DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS? THIS LITTLE CUTEST FELLOW HERE?
THAT'S... THAT WAS LITTLE LENA. AND I... AND NOW LENA'S IN ALBUQUERQUE AT THE ALBUQUERQUE ZOO AND LENA IS LIKE THIS NOW.
Jon: GIGANTIC. IS THAT A GORILLA.
YES, BABY GORILLA. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LOS ANGELES ZOO... A LOT OF ZOOS  BUT LOS ANGELES ZOO FOR OVER 50 YEARS AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER, THE WONDERFUL PHOTOGRAPHER WHO TOOK  ALL THE PICTURES IN HERE, ALL THROUGH THE YEARS HE WOULD GIVE ME A PRINT OF PICTURES THAT HE'S  TAKEN, GORGEOUS PICTURES. AND... BUT I'VE BEEN WITH THE ZOO SO LONG MANY OF THOSE ANIMALS IN THERE ARE PERSONAL  FRIENDS OF MINE.
Jon: OH!
SO I PRINTED... I SAID I HAD TO SHOW HIS PICTURES BUT THEN I JUST TALK ABOUT MY PERSONAL FRIENDS.
Jon: NOW HAVE THEY HAD TO BUY THE BOOK OR DO YOU GIVE COPIES TO YOUR FRIENDS? (LAUGHTER) OR DOES LENA... I MEAN, DOES LENA GET A COPY OR HOW DOES THAT...
NO, I... YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM WORK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE. (LAUGHTER) AND I THINK LENA TOOK UP A COLLECTION AMONG ALL THE KEEPERS.
Jon: THAT WHY THE GORILLAS ARE ALWAYS SHAKING THE LUGGAGE TO GET SOME MORE MONEY.
PROBABLY, PROBABLY. I SHAKE MY BAGGAGE, TOO.
Jon: DON'T WE ALL. WOULD THEY... DID THE ANIMALS AT A CERTAIN POINT... DO THEY RECOGNIZE YOU? DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM? WOULD THIS LARGE GORILLA KNOW YOU?
WELL, SHE DID WHEN SHE WAS A BABY AND I WAS HOLDING HER BUT  THEN SHE MOVED TO ALBUQUERQUE SO I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO DO THAT. BUT THE ONE ON THE BACK, THE WHITE WHALE AT THE AQUARIUM.
Jon: CAN YOU GET THAT, DISMUK.
THAT'S BEETHOVEN AND BEETHOVEN DOES... HE'S IN THIS  HUGE POOL AS BIG AS THIS WHOLE STUDIO AND HE... WHEN HE KNOWS I'M THERE HE COMES SWIMMING  ACROSS I'M IN THE WATER UP TO HERE AND HE KISSES ME RIGHT THERE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) OH, HE IS WONDERFUL!
Jon: THEY'RE INCREDIBLY SMART THESE WHALES.
OH, THEY'RE SO INTELLIGENT AND YOU CAN... HE COMES UP, HE  SWIMS UP AND I'M SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE POOL AND HE PUTS HIS  HEAD WHICH IS ABOUT LIKE THIS ON MY LAP AND SO THEN THE... HIS TRAINER AND BEST FRIEND SAYS  "BEETHOVEN, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW BETTY YOUR TEETH." WELL HE HOPES THIS MOUTH AND I  RUN MY FINGER AROUND HIS TEETH, AROUND HERE AND HE JUST THINKS THAT'S WONDERFUL. (LAUGHTER) AND I THINK... I'M... I'VE GOT MY HAND IN THE MOUTH OF A BELUGA WHALE. HOW LUCKY CAN I GET?
Jon: YEAH, THAT TRICK ONLY DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK... (LAUGHTER). KEEP YOUR HANDS... "HOT IN CLEVELAND" PREMIERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT?
