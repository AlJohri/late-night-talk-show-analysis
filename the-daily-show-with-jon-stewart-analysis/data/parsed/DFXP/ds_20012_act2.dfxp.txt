WELCOME BACK! SO, SO YOU KNOW HOW SOME POLITICAL  IDEAS SOUND GREAT IN THEORY. AND YOU THINK MAN, IF ONLY WE COULD TEST THEORIES IN A GIANT EXPERIMENT INVOLVING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE'S LIVES.   YOU KNOW, WHO WOULD BE CRAZY  ENOUGH TO AGREE TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? TURNS OUT KANSAS.  JESSICA WILLIAMS REPORTS ON THE  RESULTS.
IN 2010 FORMER SENATOR AND  FETUS WHISPERER SAM BROWNBACK  WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR OF KANSAS AND  HE HAD A DREAM.
EXPANSION OF GUN RIGHTS', RESTRICTIONS ON ABORTION, SHARPLY REDUCED WELFARE ROLES, INCREASED VOTER REGISTRATION SCRUTINY.
A BORING WHITE GUY DREAM.
GET OUR TAXES DOWN.
GET THOSE RATES DOWN AND STIMULATE  GROWTH.
AND REPUBLICANS REJOICED.
I DID VOTE FOR GOVERNOR BROWNBACK, WE DID GET SOME TAX CUTS, AND WE APPRECIATE IT.
UNDER THE BROWNBACK TAX PLAN  ANY OWNER OF A BUSINESS DOESN'T  HAVE TO PAY ANY TAX.  IT'S UNIQUE, KANSAS IS THE  ONLY STATE DOING THAT.
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE A  WHOLE BUNCH OF LESS TAXES AND  MORE REVENUE AND MORE JOBS?   THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
YOU'RE LIVING IN A KANSAS  UTOPIA RIGHT NOW OF  REPUBLICAN BONERS. YES, THIS WOULD BE THE ERECTION OF A CONSERVATIVE UTOPIA.
WE'LL HAVE A REAL LIVE EXPERIMENT.
I THINK KANSAS IS GOING TO DO WELL.
AND NOW THE RESULTS OF THAT EXPERIMENT ARE IN.   THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.
IT'S JUST BEEN AN ABJECT FAILURE.
I'M SORRY, WHAT?
I WISH IT HAD WORKED.   IT WOULD BE GREAT.
YEAH.
THIS IS REALLY AN EXPERIMENT  GONE HORRIBLY WRONG.
OKAY.   HOW BAD COULD IT BE?
CREDIT DOWNGRADES, DEFICIT  SPENDING, CUTS IN EDUCATION,  CUTS IN HIGHWAYS, THAT'S WHAT I  CALL A TRAIN WRECK.
OH, I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.  ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE A  REPUBLICAN?
I'M A REPUBLICAN.
BECAUSE YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE  ONE.   NAME THREE HIP HOP ARTISTS. EMINEM DOES NOT COUNT.
TUPAC WOULD BE ONE -- AND THEN -- THERE'S UH -- AND UH
YOU'RE TAKING TOO LONG.
THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS.
OKAY, YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN.
AND IT TURNS OUT KANSAS IS SCREWED.
REVENUE WAS  DOWN 680 MILLION  DOLLARS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR.   THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY IN KANSAS.
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO  ANYBODY.
THE PROBLEM WAS, LESS TAXES  ON THE JOB CREATORS DIDN'T LEAD  TO JOBS CREATED.
JUST BECAUSE WE GOT A TAX CUT DIDN'T MEAN WE NEED TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE.   WE PUT THAT MONEY IN OUR POCKET.
THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED  TO WORK.   YOU GET TAX CUTS AND THEN YOU USE  THAT TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE.
WHY HIRE PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T  NEED?   DON'T DO THIS TO ME.   DON'T DO THIS TO ME, DUDE. STOP.
I GUESS BROWNBACK HOPED THAT BUSINESS OWNERS LIKE ROSS WOULD  GET MORE CREATIVE WITH THEIR HIRING  PRACTICES.
WHY WOULD WE NEED A TRACTOR  DANCER ON THIS FARM?
CAUSE IT'S FUN. CROP AND LOCK IT. YOU HAVE A DRIVER, YOU HAVE A DANCER. THAT'S TWO JOBS FOR ONE TRACTOR.
OH GOSH.
AND WITH LESS MONEY THE STATE HAD TO MAKE A FEW TINY CUTS IN  EDUCATION.
WE'VE EXPERIENCED THE LARGEST  CUT IN PER PUPIL SPENDING IN  KANSAS IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF  THE STATE.   THEY'VE CLOSED FIVE SCHOOL  BUILDINGS IN OUR DISTRICT.   CLASS SIZE IS GOING UP.
LOOK, I LOOKED IT UP. THE TWO BIGGEST INDUSTRIES YOU GUYS HAVE IN KANSAS ARE FARMING AND AEROSPACE. YOU DO NOT NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL FOR THAT. YOU CAN LEARN THAT FROM YOUR PAPPY.
WELL, ACTUALLY YOU CAN'T.   THIS IS GOING TO BE THE OPPOSITE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR  KANSAS.
THEN THE UNTHINKABLE  HAPPENED.   SOMETHING THE SOLIDLY CONSERVATIVE STATE OF KANSAS COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED.
REPUBLICANS FOR KANSAS IS A GROUP OF CURRENT AND FORMER REPUBLICAN LEADERS, ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO THINK THAT KANSAS IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.  WE'RE SUPPORTING THE DEMOCRAT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S RACE IN  KANSAS.
UM, I KNOW THIS IS TV AND EVERYTHING, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU KIND OF MISSPOKE.  WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK, WE'RE GOING TO DO IT  AGAIN.   SO, WHO ARE YOU SUPPORTING IN THE  UPCOMING ELECTION?
REPUBLICANS FOR KANSAS VALUES SUPPORTING THE DEMOCRAT.
OKAY.   YOU DID IT AGAIN.   JUST ONE MORE TIME, LOOK, I KNOW  YOU'RE NERVOUS, YOU'RE IN THE  PRESENCE OF A SUPERSTAR.   BUT JUST SORT OF RELAX A LITTLE  BIT.   SO, WHO ARE YOU SUPPORTING IN THE  UPCOMING ELECTION?
WE'RE SUPPORTING THE DEMOCRAT.
IN FACT, THE ONCE UNBEATABLE  BROWNBACK NOW TRAILS IN THE  POLLS.   BUT DON'T WORRY, HE HAS A  SOLUTION.
HIT THE ACCELERATOR ON WHAT  WE'RE DOING.   TAX CUTS TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. THIS IS GOING TO WORK AND WE'RE GOING TO STICK WITH.
YEP, THE SOLUTION TO THE FAILED CONSERVATIVE UTOPIA IS MORE OF IT.
YOU KNOW, LEADERSHIP IS BEING ABLE TO  SAY I MADE A MISTAKE.   KANSAS IS A GREAT TRADITIONAL MODERATE STATE. AND IT'S LIKE WE'RE NOT IN KANSAS  ANYMORE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.   IT'S NOT KANSAS ANYMORE.   IT WAS SOMETHING MUCH, MUCH  WORSE.
COME WITH ME!   LET'S GO OFF TO FIX THIS.   IT WILL BE -- WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE [BLEEP] ROAD? OH, RIGHT. NO TRANSPORTATION BUDGET. GET ME THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE. GET ME THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE. I'M GOING TO TAKE A CAB. I GONNA -- OKAY.
THANK YOU, JESSICA WILLIAMS,  EVERYBODY.   WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
