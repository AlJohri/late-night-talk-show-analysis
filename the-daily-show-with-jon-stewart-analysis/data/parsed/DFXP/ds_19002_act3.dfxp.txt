Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, BEST SELLING AUTHOR, HIS BOOKS INCLUDE CLOUD ATLAS HE'S HERE TO TALK ABOUT A BOOK HE TRANSLATED AND WROTE THE INTRODUCTION FOR, IT IS CALLED THE REASON I JUMP. THE INNER VOICE OF A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY WITH AUTISM BY NAOKI HIGASHIDA, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW DAVID MITCHELL. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
IT IS A PLEASURE.
Jon: AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOUR BOOKS AND I DO LOVE YOUR BOOKS --
THANK YOU.
Jon: -- THIS, THE REASON I JUMP IS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE BOOKS I THINK I HAVE EVER READ. IT IS TRULY MOVING, EYE OPENING, INCREDIBLY VIVID, HOW DID YOU BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS?
WELL, BRIEFLY, MY WIFE AND I HAVE A BOY WITH AUTISM. SHE HAPPENS TO BE FROM JAPAN AND SOME YEARS AGO, THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO, SHE WAS LOOKING THROUGH A WELL-KNOWN ONLINE RETAILER, AND SHE FOUND A REFERENCE TO THIS. SO WE HAD THE DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM FOR OUR SON BUT WE DIDN'T, STILL DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT. SO SHE ORDERED THE BOOK, READ IT, STARTED READING SECTIONS OF IT FOR ME, IN THE END SHE WAS READING THE WHOLE BOOK, AND IT REALLY SORT OF ALTERED HOW WE VIEWED OUR OWN SON'S AUTISM AND HOW TO RELATE WITH HIM AND WHAT HIS POTENTIAL COULD BE. WE STARTED TO DO AN UNDERGROUND TRANSLATION FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LOOKED AFTER OUR SON AND THEN MY AGENT GOT TO HEAR ABOUT IT AND HERE WE ARE. THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS YOUNG BOY'S UNDERSTANDING OF HIS PROCESS EXPLODES SO MANY MYTHS ABOUT PEOPLE WITH AUTISM.
YES, WE FEEL SO -- OF COURSE, AS YOU KNOW, YOU DO SOME FUNDRAISING WORK FOR AUTISM YOURSELF, YOU ARE AWARE OF HOW MANY PRESENTATIONS OF AUTISM THERE ARE, AND IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO TALK ABOUT AUTISMS, THAN IT DOES ABOUT AUTISM. FOR NAOKI, HE HAS HAD A LUCKY GENETIC HAND THAT HIS AUTISM, WHILE HE COULDN'T HAVE THIS CONVERSATION FOR EXAMPLE, HE WOULD BE TOO AUTISTIC FOR THAT, HE IS ABLE TO TYPE, AND BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU CAN SEE WHAT MENTAL ELOQUENCE CAN EXIST BEHIND THIS WALL OF SPEECHLESSNESS WHICH IS A PRETTY COMMON MANIFESTATION OF MANY PEOPLE WITH AUTISM.
AND THAT IS THE VIEW, I THINK THERE IS A TENDENCY YOU CAN VIEW A CHILD OR A GROWNUP WITH THIS AS BROKEN. THEY ARE BROKEN.
YES.
Jon: AND YET WHEN YOU SEE THEIR LIFE AND THEIR INNER LIFE IS AS COMPLEX AS NUANCED, IT STRUCK ME, I SPENT THE SUMMER IN JORDAN AND EVERYONE SPOKE ARABIC BUT ME AND IT WAS VERY ISOLATING AND I COULDN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE, AND OBVIOUSLY I WAS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WELL ENOUGH TO GET WHAT I NEEDED AND THEY UNDERSTOOD WHERE I WAS COMING FROM, BUT I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE AUTISM OR THE SYNDROME ARE NOT -- DON'T WANT TO BE ISOLATED, THEIR CONDITION ISOLATES THEM.
YES. I THINK OFTEN SYMPTOMS AND CAUSE CAN GET MIXED, IT IS A MYSTERIOUS CONDITION. ESSENTIALLY, WE WILL ONLY UNDERSTAND AUTISM WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THE BRAIN, AND WE ARE ABOUT TWO OR THREE EINSTEINS AWAY FROM THAT, HOWEVER, IT IS NOT THAT THEY ARE BROKEN, IT IS THEIR MEANS OF COMMUNICATING, WHAT IS GOING ON IN THEIR MIND, THAT IS BROKEN. AND WITH LUCK AND WITH HELP YOU CAN WORK ON THAT, AND HELP THEM TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES.
Jon: WHAT WAS THE MOST HEARTBREAKING PARTS TO READ ARE THE PARTS WHERE THIS CHILD IS VERY AWARE OF THE STRESS THAT THE CONDITION IS CAUSING ON HIS CAREGIVERS AND ON HIS PARENTS AND THE PEOPLE, AND HIS LOW SELF-WORTH BASED ON NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THESE THINGS, THAT HE KNOWS YOU WANT HIM TO CONTROL.
YES. AND WHEN WE WERE TRANSLATING THAT, I JUST WANTED TO TELL HIM -- YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITH YOUR AUTISM, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT US. BUT HE DOES, AND THAT'S ONE MORE THING THAT PEOPLE WITH AUTISM, AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO DO. I MEAN, FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, ON -- THAT IS ALMOST THE DEFINING FACET OF AUTISM, THAT THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF EMPATHIZING AND INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING HOW OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT BE FEELING. BUT HE CERTAINLY CAN, AND MANY, MANY PEOPLE WITH AUTISM ARE MORE ABLE TO EMPATHIZE THAN WE GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR.
Jon: ALMOST THE ANTITHESIS, IT IS SO RAW FOR HIM THAT HE ALMOST CAN'T BEAR TO DISAPPOINT IN THAT REGARD.
YES. YES. TO WHAT DEGREE THIS IS AUTISM, TO WHAT DEGREE A 13-YEAR-OLD JAPANESE KID WHO DOESN'T WANT TO LET PEOPLE DOWN FOR REASONS, IT IS MYSTERIOUS AND WHERE AUTISM BEGINS AND PERSONALITY STARTS. IT IS A VERY HAZY AREA, BUT THE BOOK WAS SO HELPFUL FOR ME IN RELATING TO MY SON, AND IT IS NOT THAT UNUSUAL. MANY PEOPLE WHO --
Jon: IT IS THE MOST ILLUMINATING BOOK I THINK I HAVE EVER READ ON THE SYNDROME AND ON -- AND ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND IT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE SOMEONE WITH THE SYNDROME AS AN INDIVIDUAL, AND THAT IT IS NOT A SYNDROME.
IT COMPLETELY RUINS THE VOCABULARY.
Jon: WILL YOU HANG AROUND FOR A LATE BIT. I DON'T NORMALLY URGE YOU -- THE REASON I JUMP IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW, PLEASE IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE, PICK IT UP, IT IS REMARKABLE. DAVID MITCHELL.
