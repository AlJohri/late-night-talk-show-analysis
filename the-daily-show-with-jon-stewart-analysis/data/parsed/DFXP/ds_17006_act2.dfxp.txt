(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK! UNBELIEVABLE. HARD TO BELIEVE, THE OCCUPY WALL STREET MOVEMENT IS ONE MONTH OLD TODAY. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEY'LL BE MOVING OUT AND GETTING AN ENCAMPMENT OF THEIR OWN! WE SENT JOHN OLIVER TO WALL STREET TO SEE IF THE 99% HAD ROOM FOR ONE MORE.
OCCUPY WALL STREET HAS A BROAD MESSAGE AGAINST FINANCIAL INEQUALITYS THAT MANY OF US CAN  AGREE WITH. THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE 99% AND AS PART OF THAT 99%, I COULDN'T  WAIT TO GO DOWN TO ZUCOTTI PARK TO SEE THE MOVEMENT FIRSTHAND.
WE'VE GOT A FINANCIAL SYSTEM, WE'VE GOT AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T WORK  FOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE.
PERFECT. A NORMAL, REGULAR GUY. UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T LEAVE THEN. I REALLY WANTED TO FEEL PART OF THIS, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THEM THAT WAS STARTING TO  MAKE IT REALLY DIFFICULT.
GLASS-STEAGALL SHOULD BE REINSTATED. PEOPLE ARE STARVING, PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR BILLS, PAY THEIR MORTGAGE. THE UPTICK RULE FOR SHORT SELLING SHOULD BE IN EFFECT. PEOPLE ARE BEING KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOMES. SOMEONE NEEDS TO TAKE A STAND.
THAT SOUNDS ENTIRELY REASONABLE.
I THINK SO.
AND YOU'RE DRESSED LIKE A VIKING.
YEAH. ♪ WE'RE NOT GUN THAT TAKE IT, NO WE AIN'T GONNA TAKE IT ♪
WE'RE FIGHTING THE MAN. THAT'S OUR ANTHEM RIGHT THERE.
AM I THE MAN? YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL LIKE THE MAN.
YOU HAVE A SUIT.
AFTER JUST A MONTH THEY'D ALREADY BEGUN TO THINGS. MANAGING TO REPLACE OUR INEFFECTIVE AND ANNOYING PARLIAMENTARY PROCESS WITH THEIR  OWN SYSTEM OF DECISION MAKING THAT WAS SO MUCH WORSE. OKAY
OKAY, SO FIRST OFF THIS MEANS I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA AND THEN  THERE'S THIS MEANING I LIKE SOME OF THE STUFF BUT NOT SOME OF THE  OTHER... NOT SOME OTHER STUFF. AND THEN THIS MEANS NO, I DON'T LIKE ANY IDEAS. I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA AT ALL. (LAUGHTER)
YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE UP GESTURES.
WHY NOT?
WELL, BECAUSE CLAPPING ALREADY EXISTS. APPLAUSE IS ALREADY THERE.
WELL, THAT'S ANNOYING.
NO IT'S NOT ANNOYING! IT'S HOW WE DO IT. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY "OH, WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAVE ANYMORE, INSTEAD WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS." (LAUGHTER) STOP IT. PLEASE STOP IT.
AND THE MORE YOU AGREE WITH THE MESSAGE, THE HARDER IT IS TO WATCH THINGS LIKE THIS.
WE USE THIS HUMAN MIC...
WE USE THIS HUMAN MIC...
WE AMPLIFY EACH OTHER'S VOICES.
WE AM PLY PHI EACH OTHER'S VOICES.
MIC CHECK.
MIC CHECK.
MIC CHECK.
MIKE CZECH.
CAN I TRY?
YES.
MIC CHECK!
MIKE CHECK.
THE HUMAN MICROPHONE...
THE HUMAN MICROPHONE...
WHILE WELL INTENTIONED...
WHILE WELL INTENTIONED...
IS INCREDIBLY ANNOYING...
IS INCREDIBLY ANNOYING... AND EMBODIES EVERYTHING THAT PEOPLE  ARE FRUSTRATED ABOUT MOVEMENTS LIKE THIS.
ABOUT MOVEMENTS LIKE THIS. (APPLAUSE) EVERY MOVEMENT NEEDS THEIR ATTENTION GRABBERS TO GO ALONG WITH THEIR LEGITIMATE POINT. MAYBE IF I COULD HELP THEM STRIKE JUST THE RIGHT BALANCE IT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE PALATABLE. OKAY, TRY THIS. DRUM. GOOD. GIVE ME A GUY WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.
I THINK OUR MESSAGE IS CRYSTAL CLEAR.
OKAY, GIVE ME CHANTERS. WE NEED SOME ACCORDIONS, GIVE ME ACCORDIONS. O.K., THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. MORE DRUMS. LOUDER. MORE ACCORDION. THAT'S GOOD. : (BLEEP) (BLEEP) FORGET IT. HOW AMONGST THE 99% DID I STILL FEEL LIKE I DIDN'T FIT IN? I WENT TO VISIT THE 98% OF AMERICANS WHO MIGHT AGREE WITH THE PROTESTORS' MESSAGE WERE IT  NOT FOR THE PROTESTORS THEMSELVES.
THEY DO HAVE A GOOD POINT.
I SYMPATHIZE WITH THEM AS WELL. I MEAN, WHEN 1% HAS SO MUCH MONEY AND THE OTHER 99% DOESN'T, IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.
THE WAY OUR SYSTEM, THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM IS SET UP, I THINK INEVITABLY ELIMINATES THE MIDDLE-CLASS.
YOU KNOW WHAT MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT POINT IS? YOU DON'T HAVE RAY ZI TATTOOS ALL OVER YOUR FACE.
I AGREE.
AFTER TALKING FOR HOURS WE CAME TO A CONSENSUS.
SOMEONE HAS TO DO SOMETHING.
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE.
NORMAL PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING STUFF ABOUT THIS.
KEY WORD "NORMAL."
THE NORMAL PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
GET OFF YOUR ASS.
RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. (LAUGHTER)
I'VE GOT GET THE KIDS READY FOR BED.
I'M GOING TO WATCH THE JETS GAME. THERE'S A NEW T.V. SHOW STARTING TONIGHT.
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. LET'S GET THE CHECK.
CHECK! ALL IS FINALLY RIGHT WITH THE WORLD, ME AND MY NORMAL FRIENDS WOULD DO SOMETHING TO END  FINANCIAL INEQUALITY. WE'D TAKE IT TO THE STREETS. WE'D OCCUPY THE PARKS IF WE HAD TO AND WE'D DO IT SOON. RIGHT AFTER THE JETS GAME.
