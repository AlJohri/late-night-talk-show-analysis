(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. AS YOU MAY KNOW INSTEAD OF STEEP  BUDGET CUTS KNOWN AS THE  SEQUESTER RAPIDLY APPROACHING IS THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW RECURRING  SEGMENT. CONGRESS PASSED AND THE  PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW THE  SEQUESTER, $1.2 TRILLION IN AUTOMATIC SPENDING CUTS OVER TEN  YEARS THAT WOULD KICK IN UNLESS  WE CAME UP WITH A COOPERATIVE DEFICIT REDUCTION PLAN. WE PUT THIS INTO PLACE  BECAUSE... WHY DID WE DO THAT  AGAIN?
WHEN ALL SIDES AGREED TO THE  SEQUESTER A YEAR-AND-A-HALF AGO,  THOSE AUTOMATIC ACROSS-THE-BOARD SENDING CUTS, WERE SUPPOSED TO  BE SO PAINFUL IT WOULD FORCE THE  PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS TO MAKE A  DEAL.
Jon: SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS  SEQUESTER KICKS IN?
JUST IN TIME FOR SPRING  NATIONAL PARKS LIKE YOSEMITE  WILL SEE THEIR SERVICES CUT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. I WASN'T GOING THERE ANYWAY.
700,000 CIVILIAN DEFENSE  DEPARTMENT WORKERS TO TAKE ONE  DAY OFF A WEEK, A 20% PAY CUT.
Jon: AS LONG AS IRAN DOESN'T  ATTACK ON A THURSDAY, YOU KNOW. I'M SURE IT WILL BE FINE
THE SEQUESTER COULD DEVASTATE  OUR ECONOMY.
FEWER F.B.I. AGENTS  KIDS KICKED OUT OF CHILD CARE  PROGRAM
FEWER AIR TRAFFIC  CONTROLLERS. NEARLY $4 MILLION COULD BE  SLASHED TO PROVIDE MALES FOR  NEEDY SHORTAGES. IN TEXAS NEARLY 10,000 FEWER  CHILDREN WILL RECEIVE VACCINES  FOR DISEASES LIKE WHOOPING COUGH AND THE FLU.
Jon: HOLY [BLEEP]. WE'RE DOOMED. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET JOBS  FEEDING SICK CHILDREN TO OLD  PEOPLE. WHY DID I ONLY BUY THE HAT? (CRYING)  PLEASE TELL ME THERE'S STILL  TIME TO FIX THINGS.
THIS IS THE FINAL COUNTDOWN. WE ARE JUST FOUR DAYS FROM THE  SEQUESTER DEADLINE.
Jon: FOUR DAYS. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO DO  ANYTHING. CAN'T EVEN TOW A CRUISESHIP OF  DIARRHEA TO ALABAMA IN FOUR  DAYS. ARE THEY AT LEAST WORKING HARD  ON FIXING THIS SOME
LAWMAKERS LEFT TOWN FOR A  WEEK-LONG RECESS
PRESIDENT OBAMA PLAYED GOLF  WITH TIGER WOODS IN FLORIDA LAST  WEEKEND SNIEM I'M SURE TIGER WOODS HAS A LOT OF SEQUESTER  ADVICE. "I DON'T KNOW, MR. PRESIDENT. DID YOU EVER TRY HITTING IT WITH  A CLUB?"  I DON'T KNOW. FOR MORE ON THE SEQUESTER WE GO  TO SAMANTHA BEE IN WASHINGTON. THE SEQUESTER IS FOUR DAYS AWAY. WE'RE STARING INTO THE ECONOMIC  ABYSS. WHAT IS GOING ON DOWN THERE
Reporter: NOTHING, JON. EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT JUST  FINE. NO NEED TO PANIC. NOT LIKE WE'RE FOUR DAYS AWAY  FROM EVERYTHING WE KNOW AS THE  AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE BEING  DESTROYED. WHICH IS WHY I HAVE IN NO WAY  SPENT THE LAST EIGHT HOURS  HAVING SEX WITH LITERALLY EVERYTHING THAT MOVES.
Jon: SAM, I MEAN YOU REALLY  SOUND LIKE THE WORLD IS ENDING
Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, JON. IF YOU WERE SMART YOU'D BE  BUCKET LISTING TOO.
Jon: I WANT TO BUCKET LIST. THE PRESIDENT IS BUCKET LISTING
Reporter: GOLF WITH TIGER  WOODS? BEFORE THAT, THE MIAMI HEAT? AN AFTERNOON WITH THE LADIES OF  MODERN FAMILY. YOU KNOW THE FIRST LADY'S BUCKET  LISTING TOO
Jon: WHAT IS SHE BUCKET  LISTING
Reporter: THE BANGS, JON. NOBODY OVER THE AGE OF 16 GETS  BANGS UNLESS THEY KNOW THE END  IS NEAR. THAT IS NOT ALL SHE'S BEEN UP  TO. DANCING LIKE BEYONCE WITH JIMMY  FALLON. GIVING AWAY THE OSCAR FOR BEST  PICTURE. PERSONALLY I WOULD HAVE GONE  WITH WINNING AN OSCAR. YOU KNOW, IT'S ON MY LIST.
Jon: IF THIS WERE TRUE  SHOULDN'T THEY BE WARNING THE  ENTIRE COUNTRY ABOUT THIS
Reporter: YEAH BECAUSE THIS  ADMINISTRATION IS ALL ABOUT  TRANSPARENCY. THEY WANT US TO KNOW EVERYTHING. BENGHAZI, DRONES. THAT ROOM IN THE WHITE HOUSE  BASEMENT THAT IS FULL OF BIDEN  CLONES.
Jon: BIDEN CLONES? FORGET IT. WHAT ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS? THEY HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT THIS. WHY AREN'T THEY GOING BUCKET  LIST CRAZY
Reporter: YOU MEAN WILLFULLY  BLOCKING ALL THE PRESIDENT'S  IDEAS. COME ON, JON. HE EVEN WENT ON A STATE OF THE  UNION DREAM DATE WITH TED  NUGENT. THAT IS THEIR BUCKET LIST. THEY JUST HAVEN'T UPDATED IT IN  HALF A CENTURY. GETTING THEIR BASEBALL GLOVES  SIGNED BY HERMAN KILLBREW IS  STILL ON THERE
Jon: THAT WON'T HAPPEN. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY WHAT'S  NEXT ON YOUR BUCKET LIST
Reporter: NOT TALKING TO YOU,  THAT'S FOR SURE. IF YOU EXCUSE ME I AM OFF TO  SHOOT A PANDA WITH A CROSS BOW.
Jon: YOUR DYING DREAM IS TO  KILL A PANDA
Reporter: NO, JON. IT'S TO EAT ONE. YOU HAVE TO KILL IT FIRST.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, SAM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER
