John: WELCOME BACK, MY  GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTOR WHO  WROTE, DIRECTED AND STARRED IN HER NEW FILM CALLED "IN A  WORLD."
WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE GYM.
WHO DID? YOU DID. THEY WANT YOUR VOICE ON THE  TRAILER, CAROL.
BUT I'M A TECH.
YEAH, I KNOW. THE STUDIO SAID THEY FEEL IT'S A  MODERN QUIRKY CHOICE.
A WHAT?
AND THAT YOU'RE PERFECT FOR  THE GENRE.
A ROMANTIC COMEDY IS A GENRE  NOW?
WHO CARES. YOU JUST TOOK A HUGE JOB.
I DID.
I SAY NEXT UP, LEMON DROP  SHOTS ON ME.
ARE YOU EXCITED OR TRYING TO  FART?
John: PLEASE WELCOME LAKE  BELL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  FIRST OFF, ON A SIDE NOTE,  CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IS  FANTASTIC.
OH, OKAY.
Jon:  IT IS SO GOOD.
THANK YOU.
Jon: SECONDLY,  CONGRATULATIONS. THIS MOVIE IS ALSO GREAT.
THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT.
John: IT IS QUITE TOUCHING  AND IT IS SLIGHTLY RIDICULOUS. EVERYTHING YOU LOOK FOR IN A  MOVIE.
YES, THAT IS IT.
John: EVERYTHING YOU NEED  IN ONE MOVIE.
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED.
John: YOU WROTE, DIRECTED  AND STARRED IN IT. I HAVE WATCHED SOME OF THE  INTERVIEWS AND PEOPLE SEEM  INHERENTLY SURPRISED. WHAT THEY SAY THAT TO YOU, THERE  IS A HIGH TONE OF VOICE. IS IT THAT SURPRISING? YOU ARE TALENTED. IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THOSE THREE  THINGS. DON'T INHERIT MISOGYNY-- OH, YOU  DID THREE THINGS AND YOU DID  THEM WELL.
I HAD A REPORTER ACTUALLY SAY  TO ME RIGHT BEFORE I WAS SITTING  DOWN, I WAS GETTING READY TO GO TO A SCREENING AND A Q & A, AND  I WANTED TO TALK TO THE  PRODUCTIONIST TO MAKE SURE THE LEVELS WERE RIGHT AND THAT IT  WAS GOING TO PLAY AT THE RIGHT  SOUND. I SAID, "HEY, I WAS WONDERING IF  YOU COULD PLAY IT AT DOLBY 7."
AND THE REPORTER SAID, "LOOK  AT YOU. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE A REAL  DIRECTOR.
John: ( BLEEP ) YOU.
I'M NOT KIDDING.
John: ( BLEEP ).
I'M NOT KIDDING. WE'RE ABOUT TO SIT DOWN AND TALK  ABOUT MY MOVIE. BUDDY, THROW ME A BONE.
John: THE OTHER GREAT THING  ABOUT IT-- YOU WON A  SCREENWRITING AWARD.
THAT'S RIGHT  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: DO YOU GET A STATUE  OF A GOLDEN ROBERT REDFORD FOR  THAT? WHAT DO THEY GIVE YOU?
THAT WOULD BE SO GOOD! THAT COULD BE GOOD MORE THE  MANTLE. IT'S MORE OF A GLASS IT'S SO  EMBARRASSING BECAUSE I DID KEEP  WAITING FOR IT. OF COURSE, AWARDS MEAN NOTHING  AND WE SHOULDN'T CARE ABOUT  THEM, BUT I WAS REALLY JAZZED. I WAS EXCITED.
John: ALSO THIS MOVIE  TACKLES SOMETHING WHICH IS BOTH  A FUNNY PROBLEM AND ACTUAL PROBLEM, AND THAT IS THE  EXISTENCE OF THE SEXY BABY  VOICE.
YES, OH, YES. IT IS SWEEPING OUR NATION. OUR YOUNG WOMEN. YOU KNOW THE SEXY BABY... WHICH  WE'RE ALL AWAY OF. IT EXISTS.
John: I FIND THAT TROUBLING  IN TWO WAYS. ONE, I FIND IT TROUBLING THAT  WOMEN THINK MEN ARE ATTRACTED TO  SEXY BABY VOICES AND I'M EVEN MORE TROUBLED IF THEY ACTUALLY  ARE. "YEAH, SEXY BABY. WAIT. WHAT DID I JUST SAY?"
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING SEXY  ABOUT A BABY, OBVIOUSLY, I  THOUGHT-- LOOK, KEEP IT TO  YOURSELF. I REALLY-- YEAH, I THOUGHT IT  WAS AN INTERESTING SORT OF VIRUS  THAT WAS SWEEPING THE NATION, AND I SAY IT WITH GREAT RESPECT  BECAUSE I AM A WOMAN, AND I HAVE  YOUNGER SISTERS AND I AM GLAD THAT THEY HAVE A NICE VOICE AND  THAT IT'S A REAL VOICE. IT'S NOT THAT IT'S A BAD VOICE. IT'S A DIALECT PEOPLE ARE  PUTTING ON.
John: IT'S A FAKE SEXY BABY. NATURAL SEXY BABY I HAVE NO  PROBLEM WITH. LET ME TAKE THAT SENTENCE  IMMEDIATELY BACK AND SWALLOW IT. FAKE SEXY BABY, NO ONE WANTS  THAT.
NO ONE NEEDS IT.
Jon: YOU TRAINED IN  LONDON.
I DID.
Jon: THE ARTS.
I REALLY GOT INTO IT, YES.
Jon: WHEN PEOPLE HEAR  "LONDON," THEY THINK OF A  GLAMOROUS MOVIE. THEY DON'T THINK OF WHERE YOU  ACTUALLY WERE. ( LAUGHTER )  WHICH--
AND BEING ENGLISH.
John: THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S  RIGHT. I'VE LOST IT. I'VE BEEN AWAY TOO LONG. OH, ( BLEEP ). WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  YEAH, YOU WERE IN BEDFORD.
I WAS IN BEDFORD GLIEWN  THAT'S PRETTY GOOD! YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW GOOD  THAT IS.
I LIKE THE VALIDATIONS. YEAH, I LIVED ABOVE A CHIP SHOP. I THINK I NEED A MODICUM OF  CREDIT FOR THAT.
John: THAT'S ALMOST  OFFENSIVE, THOUGH. YOU LIVING ABOVE A CHIP SHOP IS  LIKE ME MOVING INSIDE A HOT DOG  STAND. YEAH, THIS IS WHERE YOU PEOPLE  LIVE, ISN'T IT? THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF SOUTHEAST  LONDON?
I ACTUALLY LOVED IT. THAT WAS MY FAVORITE ACCENT  BECAUSE I FELT IT WAS THE MOST  REAL. I REMEMBER--
John: LIKE TALKING FROM THE  17th CENTURY.
BUT IT HAS A GREAT ATTITUDE,  AND I'M FROM NEW YORK SO I'M  KIND OF-- I FELT MORE COMFORTABLE IN THAT SPACE. I MEAN, I AM FROM THE UPPER EAST  SIDE SO IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK. IT'S NOT HARD AS NAILS UP  THERE, BUT YOU KNOW.
John: AS A SOUTHEAST  LONDONER LET ME SAY THE MOVIE IS  WICKED, MATE. YOU GOT TO CHECK OUT THIS FLICK,  MATE.
GO AND SEE IT.
John: THIS FILM IS-- "IN A  WORLD" PREMIERES ON FRIDAY. LAKE BELL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
