FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A PROGRAM TONIGHT!   TONIGHT ON THE PROGRAM RICHARD CORDRAY HE IS THE HEAD OF THE BRAND NEW U.S. CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECTION BUREAU. HE IS ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ONLY A "DAILY SHOW" CROWD CHEERS EQUALLY AS VOCIFEROUSLY AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY FOR LEGALIZED MARIJUANA AND -- AND -- THE HEAD OF THE U.S. CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECTION BUREAU. ONLY HERE DO YOU GET THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, AS WE DO EVERY NIGHT, LET'S GET RIGHT TO YOUR TRAFFIC ON THE ONES. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU ARE COMING TO NEW YORK CITY ON THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE -- [LAUGHTER] -- AND IT'S LAST SEPTEMBER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION HAS SHIFTED FROM ITS NORMAL HELLISH CONGESTION TO A SORT OF SOUL CRUSHING VORTEX OF EXHAUST AND HONKING WHERE YOU AND YOUR VEHICLE MERGE INTO ONE STATIONARY IMPOTENT AMALGAM OF STEEL, FUMES AND BROKEN DREAMS.  AND AN EZ-PASS. YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT TO YOURSELF IN SEPTEMBER AT THIS BRIDGE AS YOU SAT UNMOVING FOR HOURS -- HUH, IS GODZILLA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS BRIDGE DESTROYING THE TOWN? AND IF SO, COULD I TAKE THE LOWER LEVEL OF THE BRIDGE? [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, THE TRAFFIC ON THE FORT LEE SIDE OF THAT BRIDGE WAS SO UNUSUAL THAT IT HAD TO BE LOOKED INTO.
THE ALLEGATION IS THAT THIS WAS IN RETALIATION BY THE CHRISTIE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THE MAYOR OF FORT LEE DID NOT ENDORSE GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THAT IS THE MOST ASSANINE -- CHRISTIE HAD A 24-POINT LEAD OVER HIS REELECTION OPPONENT, DEMOCRAT ... WHO KNOWS? BARBARA BUONO. THE IDEA THAT CHRISTIE WAS SO MAD AT THIS ONE MAYOR FOR NOT ENDORSING HIM HE'S GONNA [BLEEP] BLOCK THE WHOLE TOWN'S BRIDGE ACCESS. YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE THE WORLD'S MOST PETTY, SPITEFUL PERSON. AND NUMBER TWO, BY THE WAY, BACKING UP BRIDGE TRAFFIC DOESN'T PUNISH FORT LEE'S MAYOR. IT PUNISHES PEOPLE TRYING TO GET THE (bleep) OUT OF FORT LEE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE MAYOR, THE MAYOR--  HE'S THE ONE GUY WHO HAS TO STAY THERE. YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING  TO YOURSELF AT THIS POINT, WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A TRAFFIC JAM FROM SEPTEMBER ANYWAY. WELL, FUNNY STORY.
NEWLY RELEASED E-MAILS HAVE LINKED THE OFFICE OF NJ GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE TO A CONTROVERSIAL LANE CLOSURE AT THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE.
ONE OF CHRISTIE'S TOP APPOINTEES AT THE PORT AUTHORITY, "TIME FOR SOME TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN FORT LEE," SHE WROTE. "GOT IT," HE SAID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OH, NO YOU DIDN'T. WELL THAT IS VERY SPECIFIC. ALRIGHT SO -- WOW. GOVERNOR CHRISTIE'S TEAM UP 24 POINTS IN THE POLLS WERE SO  SPITEFUL AND PETTY, FINE. BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE THEM EVIL.
AND LATER JOKED ABOUT KIDS WHO WERE LATE TO SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC MESS.
THIS TEXT MESSAGE EXCHANGE. "IS IT WRONG THAT I'M SMILING? I FEEL BADLY ABOUT THE KIDS, I GUESS." AND THEN, "THEY ARE THE CHILDREN OF BUONO VOTERS." [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: OKAY THAT MAKES THEM EVIL. [LAUGHTER] DID PROBABLE PRESIDENTIAL FAVORITE CHRIS CHRISTIE PERSONALLY ORDER THIS TRAFFIC HIT? I DON'T KNOW. BUT I DO KNOW ONE THING ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THIS BURGEONING SCANDAL, YOU CAN PROBABLY NOW SEE PAUL RYAN'S BONER FROM SPACE. WHOA THAT IS -- WOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.   [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. LOOKS LIKE WISCONSIN HAS A TUSK BUT I DON'T -- NOW WE KNOW HE HAS AN UPPIE. HOW WILL CHRIS CHRISTIE RESPOND? >>I AM OUTRAGED AND DEEPLY SADDENED TO LEARN THAT
NOT ONLY WAS I MISLEAD BY A MEMBER OF MY STAFF BUT THIS COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE AND UNSANCTIONED CONDUCT WAS MADE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE.
Jon: AND I'M SORRY. SORRY THAT, SORRY?
ONE THING IS CLEAR, THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS UNACCEPTABLE AND  I WILL NOT TOLERATE IT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY DESERVE BETTER
Jon: WHICH MAKES ME SORRY. I'M VERY SORRY. THIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ME OR MY ADMINISTRATION IN ANY WAY AND PEOPLE WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.
Jon: WHAT? [LAUGHTER] WELL CLEARLY SOMEBODY IS GETTING THROWN UNDER THE BUS HERE. FORTUNATELY FOR THEM THE BUS ISN'T MOVING IT'S STUCK IN TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE TRAFFIC. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR MORE ON THIS STORY -- FOR MORE ON THIS STORY WE GO OUT TO OUR SENIOR NEW JERSEY CORRESPONDENT. [LAUGHTER] HOW ARE YOU DOIN? [LAUGHTER] HOW YOU DOIN? LOOK AS A GUY WHO GREW UP IN NEW JERSEY I'M DISAPPOINTED. I AM ASHAMED OF THE STATE I GREW UP IN. I, I... POLITICAL PAYBACK THROUGH TRAFFIC CONGESTION? TO SEE NEW JERSEY SINK TO SUCH A PISS POOR THIRD RATE QUALITY OF SUCH CORRUPTION. THIS IS NEW JERSEY. A STATE RENOWNED FOR ITS PISS RICH, FIRST RATE QUALITY OF CORRUPTION. IN THE 1970's WHEN THE FBI  WANTED TO ENTRAP CONGRESSMEN AND MAYORS WITH BRIBES  FROM A FAKE ARAB SHEIK WHERE DID THEY GO? NEW JERSEY. IN THE 1980'S WHEN A STATE SENATOR WAS CONVICTED IN A  KICKBACK SCHEME, FAKED HIS OWN DEATH IN A SCUBA DIVING ACCIDENT, PICKED UP A BRIEFCASE OF CASH HE HAD STASHED UNDERWATER AND THEN DISAPPEARED, WHERE WAS THAT STATE SENATOR FROM?
NEW JERSEY.
Jon: WHEN HBO WANTED TO PORTRAY A CULTURE OF CORRUPTION WHERE DID THEY GO? NEW JERSEY. AND THEN WHEN THEY WANTED TO DO IT AGAIN BUT IN A DIFFERENT ERA, WHERE DID THEY GO? NEW JERSEY. AND PLANNING THIS OVER E-MAIL WITH NONCODED LINGO? YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.
HEY WHY DON'T WE CREATE A TRAFFIC JAM IN FORT LEE AS RETRIBUTION. YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO DIALOGUE. HERE IS HOW IT SHOULD HAVE GONE. HEY DID YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT THING? YEAH THAT THING, YEAH I TOOK CARE OF THAT THING. YEAH, OUR GOOD FRIEND LEE? YEAH HE'S CONSTIPATED ALL RIGHT. YEAH, NO, NO, NO, LEE? YEAH OUR GOOD FRIEND LEE? HE'S GONNA BE BACKED UP ALL WEEK.  YOU WANT A TASTE OF REAL AUTHENTIC NEW JERSEY CORRUPTION? HERE'S A TYPICAL NEWS STORY FROM JERSEY.
THE MAYORS FROM HOBOKEN,  SECAUCUS, RIDGEFIELD, AND THE DEPUTY MAYOR OF JERSEY CITY  AMONG THOSE CHARGED WITH BRIBERY.
Jon: MM, CORRUPT-ISH, GIVE ME MORE.
A GROUP OF RABBIS WAS ALSO ARRESTED FOR THEIR ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN AN INTERNATIONAL MONEY LAUDNERING SCHEME.
Jon: CORRUPTISH-ER. NOW FINISH ME.
ONE OF THE MEN PICKED UP YESTERDAY IS ACCUSED OF DEALING IN HUMAN KIDNEYS.
Jon: JERSEY POLITICIANS,  RABBIS, KIDNEY DEALING. CORRUPTION! CORRUPTION! CORRUPTION! ♪  CORRUPTION ♪ ♪ CORRUPTION  THAT IS THE STATE I GREW UP IN. HAVE YOU SEEN OUR STATE FLAG? THERE IS LITERALLY A SEVERED HORSE'S HEAD ON THE STATE FLAG. THAT SENDS A MESSAGE TO EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION,  "NO MOTHER (bleep), PUT 'EM IN THE MOVIE." NOW I'LL GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE. CHRISTIE HIMSELF IS A PRO, LOOK AT HOW HE HANDLED HIMSELF IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE HE DENIED IT. I WORKED THE CONES ACTUALLY. UNBEKNOWNST TO EVERYBODY, I WAS ACTUALLY THE GUY OUT THERE. I WAS IN OVERALLS AND A HAT.
Jon: BOOM. THAT IS A LEVEL OF DICKISHNESS AND SARCASM BEFITTING OUR GREAT STATE. IT'S HOW I USED TO HANDLE ANY ACCUSATION OF WRONG DOING AT HOME AS WELL. YEAH MOM, I WAS TOTALLY SMOKING POT, I'M A DRUG FIEND, AND ME AND MY FRIENDS JUST SMOKED A WHOLE BAG OF WEED, YEAH, AND NOW WE SELL IT TO OTHER PEOPLE, THAT'S WHAT  WE DO. CAUSE, THAT IS WHAT WE DID. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A SAYING IN NEW JERSEY IT'S KIND OF OUR STATE MOTTO. IT'S A DEATH TRAP, IT'S A SUICIDE WRAP YOU HAVE TO GET OUT WHILE YOU'RE YOUNG. SO DON'T BLOCK THE BRIDGE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT THAT MANY WAYS OUT.
