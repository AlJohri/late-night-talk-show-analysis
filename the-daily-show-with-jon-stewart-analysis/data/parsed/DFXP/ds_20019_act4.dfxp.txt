Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW. NOW I WANTED TO MENTION SOMETHING REAL QUICK. ON NOVEMBER 14TH WE GOT THE "ROSEWATER" MOVIE. IT'S COMING OUT. YOU CAN GO SEE IT. BUT, BEYOND THAT -- OH, I HOPE THEY PAY FULL PRICE. THE, ON 13TH WE'RE DOING WHAT'S CALLED THERE A SNEAK PEAK BECAUSE WE'RE FLASHERS. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY CALL IT A SNEAK PEAK. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS, WE'RE GOING TO SIMULCAST IT. WE'RE GOING TO SHOW THE MOVIE AND THEN MAZIAR BAHARI AND MYSELF ARE GOING TO BE INTERVIEWED BY A YOUNG  JOURNALIST NAMED STEPHEN COLBERT. AND SO YOU CAN WATCH IT, YOU CAN BE IN THE THEATER AND IT HAPPENS SIMULTANEOUSLY IN SMELL-O-VISION. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SMELL US. THERE'S THE WEBISITE FOR IT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IT. CHECK IT OUT. THINGS ARE GETTING EXCITING. I'M GETTING EXCITED FOR YOU GUYS TO SEE IT. WE'RE AWFULLY PROUD OF IT. AND ANYWAY, HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
