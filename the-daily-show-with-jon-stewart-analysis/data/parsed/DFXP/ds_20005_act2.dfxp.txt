(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE UNITED NATIONS. JUST VERY BRIEFLY TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE UNITED NATIONS. THE UNITED NATIONS, THE UNITED NATIONS WAS FOUNDED IN 1945 TO SAVE FUTURE GENERATIONS FROM THE SCOURGE OF WAR. AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW EVER SINCE EVERYTHING'S BEEN PRETTY GREAT. MORE OR LESS. WE SENT JORDAN KLEPPER TO THE U.N.'S RECENT GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO REPORT ON HOW THEY ARE DOING.
RIGHT NOW THE WORLD IS RACKED WITH PROBLEMS LIKE EBOLA, SYRIA, CLIMATE CHANGE, SUDAN, PALESTINE, THE UKRAINE, AND THAT IS JUST ONE BREATHE. IF ONLY THERE WAS AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE WAS TO SOLVE THESE KINDS OF ISSUES. OH, RIGHT, THE U.N. WITH 117 WORLD LEADERS IN TOWN LAST WEEK FOR THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, I HEADED OVER TO SEE WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE DOING TO FIX THESE MESSES.
I HAVE BEEN ATTENDING THE UNITED NATIONS MEETINGS FOR QUITE A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW. AND SOMETIMES I THINK IT BECOMES, YOU KNOW, WHERE WE JUST COME TALK TALK TALK.
WELL THE U.N. NEEDS TO BE A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE IN THEIR ACTIONS THAT THEY ARE TAKING TO COMBAT THINGS LIKE SAY EBOLA.
WE HAVE THIS ORGANIZATION THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AFTER WORLD WAR II IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THAT WAR WILL NOT BE THE DESTINY OF HUMANITY.
SO IS IT WORKING?
IT SHOULD BE WORKING BUT IN OUR CASE IT IS NOT WORKING.
WITH SO MANY DIPLOMATIC MINDS IN THE SAME PLACE, SURELY THEY WERE ALL WORKING TOGETHER TOWARDS THE COMMON GOOD AS ONE.
I WOULD BLAME PRIMARILY RUSSIA, YES I WOULD, AS A MATTER OF FACT.
WHICH STATES SPECIFICALLY ARE GETTING IN THE WAY?
BEING SUCH A GOOD DIPLOMAT AS I AM, I SHOULD PERHAPS NOT NAME AND SHAME ALL THE STATES.
INDIA?
INDIA.
CHINA.
CHINA IS. THE UNITED STATES IS.
IS CHINA THE ONE YOU WEREN'T GOING SAY?
CHINA, UNITED STATES IS.
ISRAEL IS REFUSING TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH FOR US.
POINTING FINGERS GETS US NOWHERE. BUT WHO IS GETTING IN THE WAY OF PROGRESS? IS IT THAT GUY?
AS I SAID, POINTING FINGERS WILL GET US NOWHERE. BUT --
RIGHT. HIM?
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST POINT THE FINGERS. WHEN WE POINT THE FINGERS, WE SHOULD GO TO THAT PERSON, AND TELL HIM THAT LOOK, YOU ARE THE ONE STALLING THE PROGRESS.
YEAH, LIKE HIM?
OKAY.
YES
BUT PERHAPS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE OF ALL IS THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL. AKA, THE WORLD'S [BLEEP] BLOCK. IT DECIDE WHO GET SANCTIONS, WHO GETS RESOLUTIONS AND MOST OFTEN WHO GETS IGNORED.
IT'S NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING IN SYRIA, IT'S BEEN EQUALLY HANDICAPPED OR EQUALLY DIVIDED ON UKRAINE.
IT'S NOT MAJORITY RULES BECAUSE FIVE PERMANENT MEMBERS HAVE A VETO. YOU HAVE THE UNITED STATES...
RIGHT.
YOU HAVE RUSSIA, YOU HAVE CHINA, YOU HAVE FRANCE AND YOU HAVE THE UNITED KINGDOM.
THEY ALL HAVE TO GET TOGETHER?  THREE OF THOSE WERE MAJOR DICKS.
FINALLY I FOUND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE U.N. THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE SECRETARY-GENERAL HIMSELF TO ASK HIM WHAT THE POINT OF THIS WHOLE PLACE WAS.
WE REPRESENT THE COLLECTIVE WILLPOWER OF GOVERNMENTS, OF STATES AND OF THE PEOPLE.
SO THE COLLECTIVE WILLPOWER IS TO PASS RESOLUTIONS.
YOU KNOW, WE ALL NEED TO HAVE GOOD RESOLUTIONS, RIGHT. WE ALL NEED TO KEEP RESOLUTIONS.
I BREAK MY RESOLUTIONS LIKE A WEEK AFTER I MAKE THEM.
WELL, I THINK YOU'D DO REALLY WELL AT THEN U.N. THEN.
YES, THE ONLY BULLET IN THEIR GUN IS THE HALLOW POINTED SUGGESTION.
SO YOUR STRONGEST MOVE IS TO URGE.
STRONGEST MOVE IS TO ENCOURAGE.
URGE IS ENCOURAGED.
THEY'RE THE SAME THING.
NO, URGE IS AN ENCOURAGED. IT'S MORE.
IT FELT LIKE EVERYONE I SPOKE WITH WAS JUST TALKING IN CIRCLES.
A LITTLE DIZZY.
WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS IS A FRESH START WITHOUT NONBINDING RESOLUTIONS OR IN-FIGHTING OR THOSE SECURITY COUNCIL ASS HOLES. I HAD A TRULY ORIGINAL IDEA AND I EVEN HAD A NAME.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?
WORLD BUDDIES.
WORLD BUDDIES. A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE HAS EVERYONE'S BACK.
WITH VARYING MEMBERSHIP LEVELS.
THE BEST BUDDY LEVEL YOU CAN TEXT ME ANY TIME.
OK, OK.
I'LL TEXT YOU RIGHT BACK IMMEDIATELY. EVEN IF I'M OUT AT A RESTAURANT WITH A FRIEND.
PEN PALS IS A GREAT ONE. I'LL SIGN YOUR RESOLUTION IF YOU SIGN MINE. KIND OF LIKE SCRATCH YOUR BACK.
YES. SCRATCH MY BACK.
SILVER BUDDY COMES WITH 5 FREE AIR STRIKES. YOU SIGN UP TODAY YOU GET 20% OFF.
I'M INTERESTED MOST ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE ONE THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE DIGGING OF WELLS AND WATER SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD.
DRINKING BUDDY.
YES.
OH THERE'S A DRINKING BUDDY, I SEE.
YES, I HAVE A VISION OF A WORLD WHERE COUNTRIES COME TOGETHER AND LISTEN TO ONE ANOTHER'S PROBLEMS. AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT TOO COMPLICATED.
IT'S CALLED WORLD BUDDIES. PLEASE DON'T JOIN, PLEASE DON'T JOIN. AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET EVERY COUNTRY TOGETHER, DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EVERY ONE BUT MOST COUNTRIES TOGETHER. AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE, I WOULD LOVE TO YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT OR JUST HAND IT BACK TO ME.
WELL, I WILL READ IT. I WILL GIVE IT, I WILL GIVE IT --
IT MIGHT JUST NOT BE FOR YOU.
A FEW CONSIDERATION.
YEAH. WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
