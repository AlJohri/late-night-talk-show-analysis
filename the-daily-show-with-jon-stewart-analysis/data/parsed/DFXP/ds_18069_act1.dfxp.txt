FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY SAME IN JON STEWART. DOES THAT LOOK LIKE ANYTHING IN  I TRIED TO DRAW A CARTOON. OW INDEED. WE HAVE A NICE ONE TONIGHT. JOINING US TONIGHT FROM THE  MSNBC CABLE NEWS NETWORK WE HAVE  A BASKET OF GRADUATE DEGREES. ACTUALLY IT'S RACHEL MADDOW WHO  HAS A DEGREE. SHE HAS EARNED THEM. EARNED THEM. NOT LIKE ME WITH THE HONORARY  DOCTORATE ALTHOUGH I STILL  OPERATE. [ LAUGHTER ] ONE DAY I WON'T KILL ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, NEXT MONTH MARKS THE  TENTH AND -- ANNIVERSARY OF THE  IRAQI WAR. WHAT DO YOU GET THE PAPER,  SPHWHOOD THIS MIGHT BE REGRET. HOW DO YOU START IT BY STARTING  ANOTHER WAR.
THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE IS  ENGAGED IN A WAR OF WORDS WITH  "WASHINGTON POST" REPORTER BOB WOODWARD OVER THE ORIGIN OF THE  SPENDING CUTS.
Jon: OH, A WAR OF WORDS AS  LONG AS ONE OF THOSE WORDS ISN'T  DRONE, REALLY THAT'S THE KIND OF WAR YOU CAN GET INTO WITH THIS  ADMINISTRATION. WHY WOULD YOU WORD WAR WITH A  LEDGE GEND DAIRY WORD WARRIOR  LIKE WOODWARD? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] HAIRBALL. [ LAUGHTER ] WOODWARD, OF COURSE IS THE HAND  SOME REDFORD HALF OF WOODWARD  AND BERN STYNE. IT GOES BACK WHEN HE SAID THE  WHITE HOUSE MOVED THE GOAL POST  ON THE CURRENT SEQUESTER PROCEEDINGS BY SUGGESTING TAX  INCREASES INLEW OF CUTS. THE REPUBLICANS AGREED TO  SPENDING CUTS. A FAIR ACCOUNTING OF OVERALL  DEBT WOULD ALLOW THEM -- SO THE  NOTION THAT OBAMA WAS MOVING THE GOAL POST WAS LESS ACCURATE  THAT -- SORRY. WANTED TO WAKE YOU GUYS BACK UP. [LAUGHTER] APOLOGIZE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S ACTUALLY AS FAR AS WE GOT  EVEN WRITING FRANKLY. IT WAS -- [SNORING] [LAUGHTER] IT WAS AFTER THAT ARTICLE THAT  WOODWARD RECEIVED A RATHER  CURIOUS E-MAIL.
AND IT WAS SAID TO ME IN AN  E-MAIL BY A TOP --
WHAT WAS IT?
IT WAS SAID VERY CLEARLY YOU  WILL REGRET DOING THIS.
YOU WON'T BE THREATEN BUD A  SENIOR OFFICIAL. YOU'VE GONE THROUGH WORSE THAN  THIS.
Jon: (bleep) GOT REAL  MOTHER (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'LL REGRET THIS. [LAUGHTER] THESE ADMINISTRATION  CHICAGO-STYLE THUGS STORM ARMING  A FORMERLY YOUNG REPORTER LIKE THIS, IF ONLY WE HAD THE  E-MAILS. OH, WHERE ARE YOU? PERHAPS IF I SAW JULIAN  ASSANGE'S NAME THREE TIMES  THEY'LL APPEAR. ASSANGE, ASSANGEASSANGE.
WE HAVE THE COPY OF E-MAIL.
Jon: IT TURNS OUT IT WAS  SENT TO HIM BY NOTED GANGSTER  SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISER GENE SPERLING OR MEAN GENE AS NO ONE  HAS EVER CALLED HIM. [LAUGHTER] WE'RE GOING TO READ THE E-MAILS. IF THERE ARE CHILDREN IN THE  ROOM, I WOULD ASK YOU TO HAVE  THEM LEAVE. MY GUESS IS THEY'LL THINK IT'S  PRETTY LAME SPERLING WRITES,  APOLOGIZE FOR RAISING MY VOICE IN OUR CONVERSATION TODAY.
Jon: INTERESTING TACTIC. BEGIN YOUR THREAT WITH AN  APOLOGY.
I DO TRULY BELIEVE YOU SHOULD  RETHINK YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT  SAYING THE POTUS IS MOVING THE GOAL POSTS, I KNOW YOU DON'T  BELIEVE ME BUT AS A FRIEND I  THINK YOU'LL REGRET MAKING THAT  CLAIM.
Jon: THAT'S LA COSA  NOTHING. WOODWARD IF YOU SEE I AGAIN,  I'LL WAVE TO YOU BECAUSE WE'RE  GOOD FRIENDS.
Jon: THAT DOESN'T SOUND  LIKE A THREAT TO ME AND I'M A  COWARD. I'M SURE IN HIS RETURN E-MAIL HE  DISCUSS DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THIS  BULLYING TACTIC.
GENE, DO YOU NOT EVER HAVE TO  APOLOGIZE TO ME.
Jon: BECAUSE ACCESS MEANS  NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE  SORRY. GREAT ANOTHER GINNED UP  DISTRACTION PULLING FOCUS FROM  THE SEQUESTER BUDGET CUTS. WHY IS THERE NO BILL? MR. TANGERINE MAN, WRITE A BILL  FOR ME.
WE HAVE MOVED A BILL IN THE  HOUSE TWICE. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MOVE A  THIRD BILL BEFORE THE SENATE  GETS OFF THEIR ASS AND BEGINS TO DO SOMETHING.
Jon: YES, MR. HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES YOU'VE HAD AN  UP-OR-DOWN VOTE. WHY HASN'T THE SENATE DONE THE  SAME? IS IT BECAUSE THE ARE NOT PARTY,  THE REPUBLICANS, WON'T ALLOW IT.
I WANT TO ASK BUT SOMETHING  ELSE THAT HAPPENED TODAY JOHN  BOEHNER USING COLORFUL LANGUAGE.
USE OF THE WORD ASS, THAT  WORD ASS.
GET OFF HIS ASS.
USE OF THE WORD LIKE THAT  INAPPROPRIATE OR FINE?
COMING OUT OF THE ASS.
OF THE ASS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HE SAID ASS. (bleep). [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M SORRY BUT WHEN DID THE TOUGH  EDGED CORPORATE MEDIA BECOME  SUCH DELICATE FLOWERS. OH, YOU SAID THE WORD REGRET AND  I'M AFRAID FOR MY LIFE AND NOW  THAT DREADFUL ORANGE MAN IS SPEAKING IN VULGARITIES. SEND ME THE SMELLING SALTS SO I  CAN SHOVE THEM UP MY ASS. FOR GODSAKES THIS IS ELDERLY  MORMON HARRY REID'S REACTION.
I WAS RAISED IN A LITTLE TOWN  THAT HAD 13 BROTHELS IN IT SO  I'M USED TO SOME PRETTY SALTY  LANGUAGE.
Jon: ADMIT IT, WHEN HE  STARTED WITH RAISED IN, YOU WERE  THINKING DISTRICT MORMON HOUSEHOLD OR AN ERA THAT WAS  MORE CIVIL. BUT HE WAS WHEN I WAS A KID IT  WAS ALL WHOREHOUSES. IT WAS JUST ASS, ASSASS, YOU  FEEL ME, RIGHT? MAYBE MY FAVORITE TREATMENT IS  HOW OUR FRIEND AS THE A CERTAIN  MORNING SHOW DEALT WIT.
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MOVE A  THIRD BILL WHEN THE SENATE GETS  OFF THEIR (bleep) AND DOES  SOMETHING.
Jon: WHEN YOU BLEEP IT IT  SOUNDS TEN TIMES WORSE. IT SOUNDS LIKE HE COULD HAVE  SAID (bleep). IF THE HOME AUDIENCE WANTS TO  KNOW WHAT WORD I SAID SEND A  SELF ADDRESSED ENVELOPE TO BRIAN
