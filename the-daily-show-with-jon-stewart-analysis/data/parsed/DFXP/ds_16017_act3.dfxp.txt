WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF MICROSOFT AND THE CO-CARE OF THE BILL AND  MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION. WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM BILL GATES. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HOW ARE YOU?
GREAT.
Jon: YOU WERE HERE A YEAR AGO. YOU RELEASED YOUR FOUNDATION'S YEARLY LETTER. THIS YEAR YOUR LETTER SAID YOU'RE CURING POLIO.
WELL, WE'RE PART OF A GROUP THAT IS....
Jon: DON'T BE SO MODEST. CURING POLIO. NICE JOB.
A LOT OF WORK STILL TO BE DONE BUT THAT'S A GOOD GOAL.
Jon: WHERE IS POLIO STILL ACTIVE? BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THAT HAD BEEN ERADICATED IN THE WAY THAT SMALLPOX HAS BEEN ERRATICED.
SMALLPOX IS STILL THE ONLY ONE. NIGERIA, PAKISTAN. AS LONG AS WE DON'T GET RID OF IT, IT SPREADS OUT. THOSE ARE THE FOUR WHERE WE'VE NEVER GOTTEN IT TO ZERO. WE'RE OPTIMISTIC IN THE NEXT OR SO WE'LL GET IT DONE.
Jon: IS THIS A PROBLEM OF PEOPLE IN AFGHAN, PAKISTAN AND NIGERIA AND INDIA DON'T WANT  THE VACCINE? BECAUSE THEY ARE WHOLISTIC PARENTS? (LAUGHING) OR IS IT THAT THESE ARE WAR ZONES AND YOU CAN'T GET THE DOCTORS IN? WHAT IS KEEPING THIS FROM BEING ERADICATED IN THOSE AREAS?
AT ONE POINT IN NIGERIA THERE WERE BAD RUMOR THAT THE VACCINE WOULD STERILIZE WOMEN. THAT'S BEEN LARGELY OVERCOME. WE GOT THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO STEP UP, VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN. SO NOW IT'S MOSTLY REACHING THE CHILDREN. GETTING OUT, YOU'VE TO GET OVER 90% OF THEM TO TAKE THE DROP THREE TIMES. THAT'S HARD TO DO IN A TUMULTUOUS PLACE.
Jon: THE EFFORT IN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN, I IMAGINE, WILL BE A TOUGH ONE. DO YOU MEET WITH HAMID KARZAI OR DO YOU GO TO THEM AND SAY, "WE'D LIKE TO GO TO THESE TRIBAL AREAS AND GIVE THEM DROPS."
I MET WITH PRESIDENT SADARI ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO AND THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR OF THAT  PROVINCE WAS WITH US TODAY TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET IN, GET THE TRUCKS. THERE'S A HISTORY OF DOING TRUCES WHEN YOU'RE COMING IN WITH VACCINES. WE NEED TO TAKE A PAGE OUT OF THE PAST AND GET... BECAUSE PAKISTAN MIGHT BE THE TOUGHEST OF ALL.
Jon: I'M GOING TO DRAW A PICTURE OF BIN LADEN. OKAY? OKAY. DO YOU SEE THAT? ALL RIGHT. SO I'M GOING TO GIVE THIS TO YOU. IF ANY OF YOUR DROPS PEOPLE SEES THIS GENTLEMAN, HE HAS MY PERMISSION TO TAKE HIM OUT. IS THE DIFFICULTY THERE THAT THEY DON'T TRUST... ARE YOU CONSIDERED A UNITED STATES  PERSON OR ARE YOU CONSIDERED AN INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN FOR THESE PURPOSES? HOW DO THEY VIEW YOU?
WELL, THE KEY GROUP IS EITHER PEOPLE IN THE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT OR UNICEF PEOPLE  OFTEN OUT THERE. A FEW TIMES THE UNICEF PEOPLE HAVE COME UNDER ATTACK WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE BUT  MOST OF THE TIME THEY GET A LETTER FROM BOTH SIDES SAYING WE'RE JUST HERE TO SAVE  CHILDREN'S LIVES. LET'S HAVE A DAY OF TRANQUILITY AND LET'S LET THE DROP BE DISTRIBUTED.
Jon: AND THESE ARE JUST THE ONLY FOUR COUNTRIES WHERE YOU BELIEVE THAT IT IS STILL ACTIVE.
IT KEEPS SPREADING OUT. THEN WE GET RID OF IT. THESE ARE FOUR WHERE WE'VE NEVER GOTTEN RID OF IT. WE HAVE TEN OTHERS WHERE IT'S BROKEN OUT AND WE'RE TAMPING IT DOWN. WE'RE ALWAYS SUCCEEDED AT THAT. THESE ARE THE FOUR THAT WILL BREAK OR BREAK US IN YEARS AHEAD.
Jon: WHERE ARE YOU NOW FUNDINGWISE? I KNOW YOU HAVE DEDICATED A LARGE CHUNK OF MONEY TO IT. I BELIEVE WARREN BUFFET HAD DEDICATED A LARGE CHUNK OF MONEY TO IT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT I THINK MATCHES SOME OF THAT.
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS. THEY'VE BEEN THE MOST GENEROUS GOVERNMENT. WE'VE SPENT ABOUT THE SAME. ROTARY INTERNATIONAL IS INCREDIBLE. RAISED ABOUT THE SAME. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED. I HOPE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, EVEN WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES, WANTS TO SEE THE POLIO CAMPAIGN THROUGH.
Jon: HAS ANYONE CALLED YOU AND SAID, OH, GEE, THIS BILL, WE FORGOT TO TELL YOU, WE'RE OUT OF MONEY.
IT'S IN THAT FOREIGN AID BUDGET THIS POLIO MONEY, SOME OF IT. YOU KNOW, WE HOPE IT DOESN'T GET... HOPE IT DOESN'T GET CUT. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT HELP CHILDREN THAT THE U.K. GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY KEPT THEIR HUMANITARIAN STUFF EVEN AS THEY WERE BALANCING THEIR BUDGET. I HOPE TO MAKE THE CASE WE SHOULD DO THE SAME.
Jon: HERE'S WHAT I THINK. THIS IS JUST FROM LOOKING AT EARLIER IN THE PROGRAM I THINK WE MIGHT DO BETTER TO LABEL  OUR POLIO VACCINES "MADE IN THE USA" AND MAKE THE TEAR GAS CANNISTERS REALLY HARD TO READ. MAYBE THAT... CAN YOU SELL IT AS A WAY OF ALSO INFLUENCING POLITICAL GOALS?
SURE. YOU WANT TO HAVE AID THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY PEOPLE FEEL HELP THEM, HELP THEM WITH  THEIR CHILD AND WITH DISEASE. THAT'S THE STUFF I THINK HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWING PEOPLE WE ARE VERY GENEROUS. WE WANT TO HELP. SOME AID CAN BAM FIRE.
Jon: THIS ONE IS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT'S SO DIRECT AND RARE IN THE  BUSINESS YOU'RE IN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SO MANY THINGS HAVE COMPLEX CAUSES AND RESULTS. YOU KNOW, EDUCATION AND POVERTY. THIS SEEMS SO DIRECT. TAKE THREE DROPS. IT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS IN THE WORLD. THREE DROPS AND YOU'RE DONE. EVEN THAT HAS CHALLENGES IN GETTING DONE. IS THAT FRUSTRATING?
A BIT. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. WEAVER GETTING NEW VACCINES INVENTED AND GETTING THEM OUT TO MORE KIDS. THE MORE KIDS WHO TAKE THEM, SAVES LIVES, LESS SICKNESS AND THEY CHOOSE TO HAVE SMALLER FAMILIES. EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT, JOBS, STABLE, IS FAVORED IF YOU GET GOOD HELP.
Jon: WHAT IS NEXT AFTER THAT? WHAT'S THE NEXT GOAL?
WELL, THE HEALTH THINGS ARE ABOUT HALF OF WHAT WE DO. THEN WE HAVE AN EFFORT IN U.S. EDUCATION TO TRY AND HELP TEACHERS LEARN WHAT WORKS, WHAT DOESN'T, REINFORCE THINGS THAT ARE WORKING. THAT'S A TOUGH ONE. BUT VERY IMPORTANT.
Jon: BUT YOU'RE IN THERE. YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE IN THERE? YOU'RE BATMAN.
NOT ROBIN?
Jon: NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE BATMAN. YOU WERE NOT BATMAN BEFORE BUT NOW YOU'RE BATMAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STOPPING BY. YOU COME IN A YEAR. EVERY YEAR WE'LL CHECK IN AND SEE WHAT HAS BEEN ERADICATED NEXT.
THANK YOU.
Jon: REMEMBER, WE HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE. YOU STAY HERE, SIR. BILL GATES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
