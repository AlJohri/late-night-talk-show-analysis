HEY, WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, HERE IN NEW YORK, HERE IN NEW YORK AND THE NORTHEAST, WE HAVE OUR OWN SPECIAL BRAND OF WARMTH. BEST SUMMED UP AS, YOU LOOKING AT ME? ADMITTEDLY, OUR SOUTHERN BROTHERS COULD TEACH US A LESSON IN MANNERS, OR SO WE THOUGHT. AL MADRIGAL HAS MORE.
THE SOUTH IS KNOWN FOR ITS HOSPITALITY, SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHEN GEORGIA ASKED TENNESSEE FOR A LITTLE DRINKING WATER THAT THE VOLUNTEER STATE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HELP.
GEORGIA CAN KEEP ITS GREEDY HANDS OFF OUR LAND AND ITS THIRSTY MOUTHS AWAY FROM OUR WATER.
IT'S OUR LAND, IT'S OUR WATER. THE BORDER WAS DRAWN ALMOST 200 YEARS AGO. THE LAND HAS BEEN TENNESSEE'S FOR ALMOST 200 YEARS. WE'RE GOING TO DEFEND OUR BORDER AND PROTECT OUR RESOURCES.
OKAY. WELL, I GUESS THE PROBLEM IS THAT GEORGIA WANTS TO MOVE THE BORDER FROM HERE ALL THE WAY HERE, WHERE IT WAS ORIGINALLY MEANT TO BE BEFORE A SURVEYING ERROR COST THEM ACCESS TO THE RIVER. DADE COUNTY CHAIRMAN TED RUMLEY
IT'S ACTUALLY OUR LAND ACCORDING TO OUR SURVEY RIGHTS. WE'RE IN DIRE NEED OF WATER. ATLANTA ESPECIALLY THE ATLANTA REGION.
IS THAT WHY HONEY BOO BOO IS FORCED TO DRINK SO MANY RED BULLS, BECAUSE OF THE WATER SHORTAGE?
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
THE MOST FAMOUS PERSON IN YOUR STATE.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
YOU DON'T FOOL WITH PEOPLE. IT'S REALLY A SERIOUS ISSUE FOR THE STATE OF GEORGIA. IT'S NOT SOMETHING REALLY, YOU KNOW TO, JOKE ABOUT.
OF COURSE IT ISN'T. AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO FUNNY CITY PEOPLE IN RURAL GEORGIA.
WHAT THE HELL YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
TO OUTSIDERS, THEY MIGHT SEEM LIKE BICKERING SIBLINGS, BUT THE BATTLE FOR THE JASPER-CHATTANOOGA CORRIDOR IS ALREADY GETTING BLOODY.
GEORGIA DON'T NEED TO BE TRYING TO COME OVER INTO TENNESSEE AND TAKE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT THEIRS.
BUT THEY'RE PEOPLE, JUST LIKE YOU.
I DON'T REALLY GIVE A [BLEEPED].
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF GEORGIA'S CLAIM TO THIS TERRITORY WE'RE ON RIGHT NOW?
NO, THIS IS TENNESSEE.
I REALIZE WE'RE IN TENNESSEE, BUT GEORGIA THINKS IT'S GEORGIA.
WE'RE IN TENNESSEE.
YOU'RE ACTUALLY FROM GEORGIA.
YES, SIR. YES, SIR.
I GOT TO BE HONEST, YOU LOOK AND SOUND LIKE YOU'RE FROM TENNESSEE.
OH, BUDDY, NO, NOT AT ALL.
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY DIFFERENT?
100% DIFFERENT.
OBESITY RATES ARE PRETTY SIMILAR.
OBESITY RATES, WELL, IF YOU CAN GET A DOUBLE-DOG CHEESEBURGER FOR $1, BUDDY, THAT'S THE WAY YOU GOT TO GO.
UNFORTUNATELY THIS RAGING CONFLICT HAS FORCED THE CITIZENS TO FORTIFY THEIR CARS AS PROTECTION AGAINST THE CONSTANT ROCKET FIRE ACROSS THE BORDERS.
I'M A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY FROM THE GEORGIA LINE AND YOU CAN'T MOVE STATE BORDERS.
IS IT DIFFICULT LIVING ON THE FRONT LINE?
NO.
WHEN WAS THE LAST ROCKET ATTACK.
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ONE HERE.
HOW DID IT GET SO [BLEEPED] THEN?
THIS IS A GREAT AREA. GREAT AREA.
FOR METH.
YES, JUST LIKE THE PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI CONFLICT, THIS INTRACTABLE WAR OVER A TINY SLICE OF LAND HAS NO END IN SIGHT.
SO YOU ARE LIKE THE PALESTINIANS IN THIS SCENARIO, RIGHT?
WE'RE ACTUALLY THE GEORGIANS THAT'S TRYING TO CORRECT A WRONG.
WOULD YOU SAY YOU'RE LIKE THE ISRAELIS IN THIS CONFLICT?
ISRAELIS? WE AIN'T JEWISH. THIS IS TENNESSEE.
SADLY, HATRED BETWEEN THESE GROUPS HAS LED TO UGLY STEREOTYPES.
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE PEOPLE OF ATLANTA USE 50% MORE WATER PER PERSON THAN CHATTANOOGANS.
SO THEY'RE EXCESSIVE WATER USERS? I MEAN, ISN'T THAT JUST AN OLD STEREOTYPE?
LISTEN, WE'D BE HAPPY TO SEND SOME OF OUR SCIENTISTS AND OTHERS DOWN.
WHEN YOU SAY SCIENTIST, YOU'RE BASICALLY CALLING THE PEOPLE FROM GEORGIA STUPID.
HEY, MISTER, LOOK, WE JUST TURN IT ON. THAT'S ALL WE KNOW ABOUT WATER. THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN GEORGIA. YES, IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD, THEY REFUSE TO SEE EACH OTHER AS HUMAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO DOWN THERE?
WHAT?
BUTT CHUG.
WHAT'S THAT?
THEY GO OUT AND THEY FUNNEL DIFFERENT KIND OF BEERS IN THEIR SPHINCTERS, IN THEIR RECTUMS.
SO IN GEORGIA BEER GOES IN THE MOUTH, AND IN TENNESSEE BEER GOES IN THE...
ANUS.
JUST WHEN IT SEEMED DARKEST, A SOLUTION PRESENTED ITSELF. SO THERE IS A ROAD MAP TO PEACE?
THERE IS.
AND DOES IT OR DOES IT NOT LEAD TO A HOOTERS?
WELL, THAT'S YOUR... I DON'T KNOW.
IS THERE A HOOTERS NEARBY?
30 MILES.
BUT IF THE HOOTERS' SUMMIT WERE EVER TO BECOME A REALITY, WE NEED TO START WITH SIMPLE GESTURES. THE PEOPLE FROM GEORGIA SENT A PEACE OFFERING. LUBE THAT UP A LITTLE MORE. THERE YOU GO. DO WHAT YOU PEOPLE DO. I CAN GIVE YOU SOME PRIVACY IF YOU WANT TO JUST CHUG THAT IN PRIVATE.
I'M GOOD. THANKS.
Jon: THAT'S SO NOT RIGHT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
