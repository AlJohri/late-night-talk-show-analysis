Jon: WELCOME BACK! WE'RE HERE WITH SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND. SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THESE INSTITUTIONAL SITUATIONS THAT CONTINUE.  WE'RE JUST SEEING IT WITH THE RAY RICE CASE. SO, THE MAN, THERE IS A VIDEO OF HIM TAKING HIS FIANCÃ‰ AND PUTTING HER IN THE HALLWAY. THE N.F.L. GETS AHOLD OF THIS AND THEY SAY, OK WE'RE GOING TO SUSPEND HIM FOR TWO GAMES. AND SO THE WORLD GOES, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? AND IT TAKES TIME. AND HE SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT? I MADE A MISTAKE. ROGER GOODELL, THE N.F.L. GOD, TWO GAMES, SHOULD HAVE BEEN SIX. I'M REALLY SORRY.
YEAH.
Jon: AND THEN THIS NEW TAPE COMES OUT IN THE ELEVATOR OF THE INCIDENT AND EVERYBODY SAYS, THAT'S IT, NO, GET RID OF HIM. WHAT DID THEY THINK HAPPENED IN THE ELEVATOR? WHY DID THEY NEED TO SEE A VIDEO?
HE ADMITTED TO BEATING HER. YEAH.
Jon: RIGHT. BUT WHY DID THEY NEED TO SEE A VIDEO TAPE? WHAT DID THEY THINK HE DID? DID THEY THINK HE WENT, AND SHE FELL? YOU KNOW, WHY IS IT THE INSTITUTIONS SET UP STILL THAT WOMEN HAVE TO CLEAR A BAR OF -- AND EVEN IN THIS, YOU SAY, WELL, SHE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING OR THIS AND THAT.
RIGHT.
Jon: THEY STILL HAVE TO FIGHT THROUGH THESE OBSTACLES AT EVERY TURN. WHY IS THAT STILL THE CASE?
WELL, THERE'S TWO ISSUES. ONE, THE INSTITUTIONAL SPORT. THE N.F.L., YOU KNOW, PROTECTS THEIR STAR SO THIS GUY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED AS SOON AS HE SAID I BEAT MY WIFE AND THAT'S THE VIDEO OF ME DRAGGING HER OUT OF THE ELEVATOR. THERE WAS NO QUESTION LEFT TO BE ANSWERED. THE FACTS WERE THERE. BUT YOU SEE THIS IN THE MILITARY CONTEXT, YOU SEE IT IN COLLEGE CAMPUSES, THIS CONSTANT PROTECTION OF THE STAR, OF THE FAVORITE SON, OF WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS, AND THE DISBELIEF OF THE WOMEN AND THEN THE VICTIM BLAMING. THE WELL, IT WAS WHAT SHE WAS WEARING OR OBVIOUSLY SHE CAUSED THE PROBLEM, OR SHE WAS THE ONE...
Jon: RIGHT.
THE CONSTANT VICTIM BLAMING AND THE UNDERMINING. AND WHAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT IN MY OPINION IS HOW DO WE VALUE WOMEN IN SOCIETY? AND THERE'S THIS DEVALUATION AND IT'S ACROSS EVERY BARRIER, IT'S WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND NOT BELIEVING THE SURVIVOR.
Jon: RIGHT.
OR WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. IT IS, THERE IS THIS DEVALUATION OF WOMEN AND --
Jon: BUT WHY STILL? HOW CAN THAT -- AS FAR AS -- HERE'S WHAT BLOWS MY MIND. SO, THERE ARE TWO THINGS. I READ ABOUT THIS CASE, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN COLUMBIA OR ONE OF THESE PLACES, AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT ON THE NEWS, WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS REALLY SPEAKS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WOMEN HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND NOT DRINK AT THESE PARTIES SO THAT THEY DON'T MAKE THEMSELVES VULNERABLE TO THESE TYPE OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS, BUT NOBODY SAYS, HEY, MAYBE MEN SHOULD NOT DRINK BECAUSE THAT MIGHT MAKE THEM --
YEAH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: IT'S MIND BOGGLING. IT'S ALL ABOUT WOMEN MUST DRESS DIFFERENTLY, WOMEN MUST WALK DIFFERENTLY, WOMEN MUST DRINK DIFFERENTLY. WHY ARE WE NOT ABLE TO HOLD MEN TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS BEHAVIOR? WHY? IT'S THIS IDEA OF, HEY! DUDE'S ARE DUDES!
I THINK IT'S THE DECISION MAKERS. AND SO, THE N.F.L. CLEARLY GOT THIS WRONG. IN THE MILITARY, THE COMMANDERS WANT TO STAY IN CHARGE, EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE 26,000 RAPES, SEXUAL ASSAULTS, AND UNWANTED SEXUAL CONTACT LAST YEAR ALONE.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND ONLY 3,000 REPORTED. AND ALL THE SURVIVORS OVER AND OVER AND OVER, THEY KEEP SAYING WE DON'T TRUST THE CHAIN OF COMMAND AND DON'T BELIEVE JUSTICE IS POSSIBLE. BUT THEY DON'T LISTEN TO THE SURVIVORS. THEY'RE GIVEN NO CREDIBILITY ABOUT HOW TO FIX THE SYSTEM. ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES YOU SEE THE SAME THING, VICTIM BLAMING, NO JUSTICE, YOU KNOW, NOT DEALING WITH THESE CASES APPROPRIATELY.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO, WOMEN'S VOICES NEED TO BE HEARD. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT THE NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE HEARD ON ALL ISSUES THAT AFFECT THEM AND THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT.
Jon: AND EVEN WITHIN THIS -- SO YOU'RE ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE. YOU ARE A UNITED STATES SITTING SENATOR AND YOU DETAIL OTHER PEOPLE, ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES SAYING THINGS TO YOU THAT ARE UTTERLY REPREHENSIBLE AND INSANE ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK, ABOUT THE WEIGHT, ABOUT THESE THINGS. HOW DO YOU NOT JUST TURN TO THE C-SPAN CAMERA AND GO [BLEEPED] THESE GUYS? LIKE, WHAT? HOW DOES THAT NOT HAPPEN? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW DO YOU PUT UP WITH THAT, HOW DO YOU PUT UP WITH THAT WITH SUCH GRACE?
WELL, I'M IN A STAGE IN MY CAREER WHERE I CAN REALLY JUST, YOU KNOW, JUST IGNORE IT. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN A SOUTHERN CONGRESSMAN EQUATES ME BEING EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT WITH BIG FAT, YOU'RE EVEN PRETTY WHEN YOU'RE FAT. YOU KNOW, THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS. IT'S ABUSURD, BUT I LOOK AT HIM LIKE YOU MUST BE FROM ANOTHER PLANET, BECAUSE IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE. IT IS SO FAR OUTSIDE WHAT SHOULD BE SAID. BUT I'M REALLY HAD A TOUGHER TIME WITH THIS KIND OF THING WHEN I WAS YOUNG.
Jon: SURE.
BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS.
Jon: AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER.
I DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS OR THE POWER.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND SO, I TALK ABOUT THE STORY WHEN I'M A YOUNG LAWYER. AND THE REASON WHY I WRITE THESE, I GIVE THESE EXAMPLES AS ILLUSTRATIONS FOR THE BROADER ISSUE, AND TO ELEVATE THE DEBATES, TO TALK ABOUT HOW WOMEN ARE TREATED IN THE WORKPLACE ACROSS THE BOARD.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT FOR A YOUNGER WOMAN, AND IT'S HER FIRST JOB, AND HER BOSS COMMENTS ON HER LIKE I WAS COMMENTED ON LIKE OH GOSH, KIRSTEN YOU REALLY LOOK GOOD TODAY, AS OPPOSED TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING SO HARD. THAT UNDERMINED ME SO MUCH.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT DEFLATED ME, IT MADE ME FEEL LESS VALUABLE, AND I WANT A YOUNG WOMAN READING THIS BOOK TO PUSH THROUGH AND JUST SAY, SOME DAY I'M GOING TO BE THAT GUY'S BOSS, AND I'M GONNA CHANGE THE CLIMATE AND I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS A BETTER PLACE TO WORK.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT. WELL, I THINK IT'S EXCELLENT. STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WE'RE STILL GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE THING. CAN YOU STICK AROUND?
YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: CAUSE I STILL THINK THE MAIN THING THAT HAS TO END IS MEN'S DEFENSIVENESS. THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THEY'RE ENTITLED TO A BEHAVIOR AND A PRIVILEGE THAT EXISTED. YOU KNOW, IN THE OLD DAYS, MEN COULD BE MEN AND YOU COULD SAY THINGS AND GET WOMEN FIRED FOR NOT SLEEPING WITH YOU. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON! (LAUGHTER) "OFF THE SIDELINES." IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND. WE'LL BE BACK. WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT.
