(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF  ECONOMIC ADVISORS, WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM AUSTAN GOOLSBEE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DID YOU GET THE BOUBON?
I GOT THE BOUBON FROM THE KIDS.
Jon: LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU, DON'T CHILDREN. SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE? YOUR BUDGET?
WE GOT A BUDGET AND WE GOT A JOBS COUNCIL AND I'M COMING DOWN  HERE TO TELL YOU WE'RE GOING TO GROW OUR WAY OUT OF THIS THING, JOHN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE PRESIDENT, HE WENT TO CLEVELAND AND CLEVELAND START UP AMERICA....
Jon: UH-HUH.
NO, STOP WRITING THAT.
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO GROW OUR WAY OUT OF THIS.
Jon: IS THAT HOW WE WIN THE FUTURE? WHAT IS THIS WIN THE FUTURE THING.
I'LL TELL YOU....
Jon: LET ME ASK A QUESTION. HOW FAR BEHIND ARE WE IN THE FUTURE? (LAUGHTER) HOW BADLY DO WE TRAIL THE FUTURE RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE I THINK THE FUTURE HAPPENS NO MATTER WHAT WE DO.
HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY, ECONOMISTS HAVE DOCUMENTED WHAT LEADS TO GROWTH. IF YOU ASK WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS OF GROWTH. HUMAN CAPITAL, PHYSICAL CAPITAL AND INNOVATION PRODUCTIVITY. THEY WEREN'T AS INTO THAT. THEY TRANSLATE THAT TO....
Jon: WHO?
THE MESSAGE PEOPLE. OUTEDUCATE... (LAUGHTER) OUTINNOVATE, OUTBUILD THE REST OF THE WORLD.
Jon: SO IT STILL MAKES SENSE WE WERE GOING TO WIN THE FUTURE. WILL WE KICK THE FUTURE'S ASS?
IF WE HAVE TO.
Jon: DO WE GET PENALIZED IF WE TAUNT THE FUTURE AFTER DEFEATING IT?
(LAUGHS) WE'RE GOING TO WIN IT, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT, WE'RE GOING TO  BE... IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR US. WOE L WE STARTED THE RIGHT WAY. 2010 HAS GOT TO BE FASTER BUT WE'VE HADED MORE THAN A MILLION JOBS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THE PRESIDENT'S NOW TRYING TO EXPAND THAT OUT BEYOND JUST THE SECTORS THAT IT'S BEEN IN. IT NEEDS TO BE BROAD-BASED. THE 2000s WERE THE FIRST RECOVERY IN U.S. HISTORY WHERE THE MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY'S INCOME  FELL BY $2,000.
Jon: THEY'RE GETTING HAMMERED.
THEY WERE GETTING HAMER BEFORE THERE WAS A RECESSION THEN THEY GOT DOUBLE HAMMERED IN  THE RECESSION.
Jon: WE KEPT HEARING FOR YEARS DEFICITS DON'T MATTER. DICK CHENEY FAMOUSLY SAID, RONALD REAGAN PROVED DEFICITS DON'T MATTER WHEN PEOPLE CAME IN THE REPUBLICANS CAME IN FOR  EIGHT YEARS, DEFICITS DON'T MATTER. SUDDENLY DEFICITS ARE THE ONLY THING THAT MATTER.
WE'VE GOT TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS. THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET DOES THAT. IT CUTS THE DEFICIT MORE THAN ANY PRESIDENT'S BUDGET HAS CUT IT BEFORE.
Jon:
HE WOULD SAY THAT BECAUSE HE'S GROWN IT MORE THAN ANY PRESIDENT HAS BEFORE.
Jon: WELL, THE RECESSION GREW IT.
BEFORE THE....
Jon: DID I JUST LEAVE THE FUTURE? IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
I THAT'S DISTURBING ME.
Jon: BEFORE THE PRESIDENT,...
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT TAKES OFFICE THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET  OFFICE SAYS THE DEFICIT IS ABOUT TO BE $1.3 TRILLION BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO  INTO RECESSION. NOW WE ARE COMING OUT OF THE DEEPEST RECESSION WE'VE GOT TO GROW. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WE'RE GOING TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO CUT  GRANTS THAT ARE GOING TO KEEP NINE... YOU KNOW, THE EDUCATION MONEY FOR NINE MILLION COLLEGE  STUDENTS, THAT'S NOT HELPING CREATE A JOB NOW, IT'S NOT HELPING WIN THE FUTURE JOB.
Jon: TWO QUESTIONS AND PLEASE DON'T USE THAT PHRASE AGAIN. (LAUGHTER) TWO QUESTIONS. THE FIRST IS IF STILL US WILL IS THE THING THAT GOT US OUT OF THIS RECESSION AND WE STILL NEED  TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY TO GENERATE JOBS, WHY THAT HAS ADMINISTRATION IN SOME RESPECTS  BACKED AWAY FROM STIMULUS SPENDING AND SAID WELL, ACTUALLY STIMULUS SPENDING DID IT THERE  BUT NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE DEFICIT BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT AND THE SECOND PART  OF THAT QUESTION IS... I MEAN, IT FEELS LIKE THERE ARE SOME DRACONIAN CUTS IN HERE. I MEAN, THE HOME HEATING OIL SUBSIDY PROGRAM FOR LOW-INCOME FAPL PLEASE? THAT FEELS LIKE WE ARE NOT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING OUR ECONOMY TO WIN THE FUTURE, WE'RE  TRYING TO KILL POOR PEOPLE SO THAT THE FUTURE DOESN'T KNOW THEM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IS THAT...
LET'S START WITH THAT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
BECAUSE, LOOK, A BUNCH OF THESE CUTS, THEY PAIN ME IF YOU LOOK AT THEM AND THE  PRESIDENT... THERE'S NO... NOBODY WANTS... FEELS GOOD ABOUT CUTTING ANYTHING. IF YOU TAKE THAT PROGRAM CALLED THE LAHEY PROGRAM, IT WAS RAISED DRAMATICALLY IN 2008 BECAUSE OF  T PRICE OF OIL WAS $140 A BARREL.
RIGHT.
AND SO IT WENT UP A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT. NOW THIS WOULD CUT IT. IT WOULD CUT IT BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO GET OUR BUDGET WITHIN OUR MEANS BUT IT CUTS IT BACK TO A  LEVEL THAT IS MORE PROPORTIONAL TO WHAT THE PROGRAM WAS BEFORE IT WENT ON BECAUSE OF THE OIL...
SO PRICES RIGHT NOW FOR HOME HEATING OIL ARE HIGHER THAN...
THEY ARE HIGH.
Jon: THEY'RE HIGHER THAN THEY WERE...
THEY'RE NOT HIGHER THAN THE $140.
Jon: NO, NOT THE BARREL BUT THE HOME HEATING OIL INDEX IS 3.6 INSTEAD OF 3.4.
I'M IMPRESSED. I LOVE THIS CONVERSATION.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? I'M ACTUALLY READING THAT OFF YOUR FOREHEAD. (LAUGHTER) I GOT THAT RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW. I GOT PEOPLE, BABY.
TAKE THAT OR YOU TAKE THE PELL GRANT. REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF THE PELL GRANTS THAT ARE, AS I SAY, WOULD  AFFECT NINE MILLION STUDENTS. OBAMA HAS PROPOSED CUTS TO PELL GRANTS, THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE CUT THAT HE PROPOSED IS  ABOUT PELL GRANTS FOR SUMMER PROGRAMS. NOW THE RESEARCH SHOWS... IT STILL STINKS NOT TO HAVE THAT, BUT THAT DOESN'T LEAVE KIDS TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.
Jon: IT JUST FEELS LIKE ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE FIGHTING THE BUDGET  ON THEIR TERMS IN TERMS OF THE THEORY OF WHAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD ACCOMPLISH VERSUS... YOU KNOW, 88% OF THE FUNDING, YOU HAVE TO CUT 1.1 TRILLION...
OUT OF 12% OF THE BUDGET. I AGREE WITH YOU, TO ME THIS IS... WE GOT FUN HEALTHY. WE GOT OUT OF SHAPE, WE GOT OVERWEIGHT. THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT AND GET HEALTHY SO YOU START AN EXERCISE REGIMENT....
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FOR?
(LAUGHTER)
I'M LOOKING AT MYSELF, TOO. WE NEED TO GET ON AN EXERCISE REGIMENT, BUT WHAT WE DON'T NEED  IS LET'S CUT OFF OUR FINGER, THAT WEIGHS EIGHT OUNCES.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT YOU DON'T GET HEALTHY BY SAYING "BY THE WAY, NO MORE SPINACH."  THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT... THE ARGUMENT HAS TO BE MADE... IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT FOR GOVERNMENT THAN THAT ARGUMENT HAS TO BE MADE. THESE HAVE TO BE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT ENTITLEMENTS. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY'RE USING THE BUDGET TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT GOVERNMENT OPERATES.
TO TRY THE CHANGE THE WAY GOVERNMENT OPERATES.
AND THEY FIGHT THAT IN THE SAME BATTLEFIELD...
BUT I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE PREMISE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS JUST PLAYING INTO THAT. HE ISN'T. HE'S HIGHLIGHTING THESE ARE TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT ISSUES IN THE  SHORT RUN WE'VE GOT TO GET THE ECONOMY GROWING. NOW, WE KNOW WE'VE GOT TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS, THE BUDGET IS ABOUT GETTING US LIVING WITHIN  OUR MEANS AND STABILIZING THE AMOUNT OF DEBT WE HAVE AS A SHARE OF THE ECONOMY. BUT IF WE'RE NOT GENERATING JOBS WE'VE GOT NOTHING. WITHOUT GROWTH WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. PERIOD. SO THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT....
Jon: ARE YOU... THE GROWTH PROJECTIONS THAT YOU PUT OUT, THEY'RE PRETTY HIGH COMPARATIVELY FOR WHAT PEOPLE SAID. DO YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT?
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT AND FOR 2011 AND 2012 WE HAD TO LOCK IN  THE PROJECTIONS BACK IN NOVEMBER BEFORE THERE WAS THE TAX DEAL, BEFORE THERE WAS THE PRIVATE SECTOR SAYING CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO GET SUBSTANTIALLY  BETTER SO WE'RE ACTUALLY FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS BELOW WHAT THE MARKET IS.
Jon: I APPRECIATE YOU COMING HEAR WHAT THE BOUBONS. ARE YOU HEADING BACK TO WASHINGTON?
YUP. BACK TO WHERE WE'RE PUTTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK.
Jon: YOU CAN'T MISS...
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY WINNING THE FUTURE BUT I'M GOING TO SAY  EDUCATE, INNOVATE, BUILD, WE CUT THAT, WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS.
Jon: IF YOU WERE TO RIP OFF YOUR SHIRT NOW, THAT WOULD BE ON  THE, THIS SHIRT UNDERNEATH, I'M SURE. EDUCATE, INNOVATE, BUILD! US A STAN GOOLSBEE.
