FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY EVERYBODY!  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. LISTEN UP. OH, YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS ONE. MY GUEST TONIGHT HADI AL-BAHRA, HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SYRIAN NATIONAL COALITION, AND I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE ON OUR SIDE OR HE WOULDN'T BE HERE. OF COURSE OUR NON WAR IN THE MID EAST IS ONLY GETTING MORE COMPLICATED. THE U.S. AND ITS COALITION HAS BEEN BOMBING THE REGION FOR NEARLY A WEEK, AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST WONDER TO OURSELVES HERE, ANYONE ELSE WANT IN ON THIS? WHO'S GOT NEXT? YOU KNOW, BEFORE ALL OF THE GOOD BUILDINGS ARE GONE.
BRITISH PARLIAMENT IS EXPECTED TO VOTE SOON TO JOIN THE AIR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISIS. PRIME MINISTER CAMERON RECALLED LAW MAKERS FOR A SPECIAL SESSION TO DEBATE THIS ISSUE. [LAUGHING]
Jon: LAW -- LAW MAKERS DEBATE THE ISSUE? CAMERON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT ANSWERING QUESTIONS [BEEP]. YOU JUST WALK OUT ONTO YOUR LAWN AND YOU SAY WE'RE BOMBING SOMEWHERE AND GO BACK INSIDE. BADA BING BADA LITERAL BOOM. DONE. I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT IS THERE EVEN TO TALK ABOUT?
LOOK AT WHAT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAVE BROUGHT YOU. IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND THIS GOVERNMENT LIBYA. NONE ARE SUCCESS STORIES. ARE WE GOING TO EMBARK ON ACTION THAT COULD LAST FOR YEARS? [LAUGHING]
Jon: WELL, SURE. IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT.
WHY BRITISH MILITARY ACTION AGAINST ISIL BARBARITY BUT NOT ASSAD'S BUTCHERY?
SUCH ALLITERATIVE CRITICISM. WELL, ALRIGHT, THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR THE -- UNSHAVEN BLOKE IN THE BACK, WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE?
THIS WILL NOT BE SOLVED BY BOMBING.  EVERYTHING WILL BE MADE WORSE. EXTREMISM WILL SPREAD FURTHER AND DEEPER AROUND THE WORLD. THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE CAN SEE IT, THAT THE FOOLS IN HERE WHO DRAW BIG SALARIES AND BIG EXPENSES CAN NOT OR WILL NOT SEE IT LIKE THE HONORABLE LADY WITH OUR ASININE INTERVENTION.
Jon: EXCELLENT POINT BY HOUSE OF COMMONS MEMBER GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY. HOLY. LISTEN AND LISTEN WELL! THIS PARLIAMENT WILL BE VISITED BY THREE GHOSTS. [LAUGHING]
Jon: CAMERON, ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE THIS NUANCED CRITICISM?
THERE IS A CLEAR LEGAL BASE FOR U.K. MILITARY ACTION TO HELP IRAQ. THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT HAS REQUESTED OUR HELP AND GIVEN ITS CLEAR CONSENT FOR U.K. MILITARY ACTION. THE FACT IS, THIS IS ABOUT PSYCHOPATHIC TERRORISTS THAT ARE TRYING TO KILL US. THERE ISN'T AN OPTION OF JUST HOPING THIS WILL GO AWAY.
Jon: WHAT? NOT A OPTION? HOPING IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY? IF I REMEMBER ENGLISH LITERATURE CORRECTLY, HOPING SOMETHING GOES AWAY HAS BEEN THE NATIONAL STRATEGY IN YOUR COUNTRY IN DEALING WITH EVERYTHING FROM CONSUMPTION TO COLONIAL UPRISINGS TO HOMOSEXUALITY. ALRIGHT. SO GREAT, ENGLAND'S LAW MAKERS ARE DEBATING AND VOTING ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. WAIT, I MEANT TO SAY THAT'S GREAT, ENGLAND'S LAW MAKERS ARE DEBATING AND LAW MAKING ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUE. I DIDN'T MEAN TO BRING THE SARCASM. YOU KNOW, WE ARE HAVING A DEBATE TOO.
DO YOU THINK OUR CONGRESS, OUR LAW MAKERS SHOULD BE TAKING IT UP AND DISCUSSING, DEBATING IT .
WHY ISN'T THERE THE DEBATE IN CONGRESS?
SHOULD CONGRESS COME BACK?
WHY ISN'T CONGRESS BACK AND DEBATING THIS ISSUE?
IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE A BIT OF REALLY AGGRESSIVE DEBATE.
Jon: SEE, IT'S A VERY VIBRANT DEBATE CENTERING AROUND SHOULD WE OR SHOULD WE NOT -- HAVE A DEBATE. [LAUGHING]
Jon: SO, WHY AREN'T WE GETTING ALL PARLIAMENTARY AND TALKING  ABOUT THIS?
I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD COME TO CONGRESS AND ASK FOR AUTHORIZATION.
ABSOLUTELY I'M WILLING TO GO BACK.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS AN OBLIGATION TO CALL US BACK TOMORROW TO START THIS DEBATE.
IF THE PRESIDENT HAD ASKED US TO STAY LIKE DAVID CAMERON ASKED PARLIAMENT TO COME BACK WE WOULD HAVE.
Jon: HE DIDN'T ASK. I WOULD OF COME BACK, BUT HE DIDN'T ASK. IF WE HAD JUST COME BACK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RUDE. [LAUGHING] HE DIDN'T ASK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]  IT MAKES SENSE. THE WHOLE THING MAKES SENSE. IT'S NOT LIKE CONGRESS CAN JUST CALL ITSELF BACK INTO SESSION.
HARRY REID AND JOHN BOEHNER BOTH CAN CALL THEIR RESPECTIVE CHAMBERS BACK TO CONGRESS.
Jon: YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD THE POWER TO CALL BACK TO CONGRESS. COME OUT, COME OUT WHEREVER YOU ARE. ♪ LET IT GO. LET IT GO. DON'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE. ♪ [LAUGHING] I SHOULD OF KNOWN SINGING "LET IT GO" WOULD MAKE ME GO FLACID. [LAUGHING]
Jon: SERIOUSLY, I'VE SEEN THAT MOVIE LIKE A [BEEP] THOUSAND TIMES. I REALLY FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT I CAN BUILD A [BEEP] SNOW MAN. ALRIGHT. SO CONGRESS, CONGRESS COULD RUSH BACK TO WASHINGTON AND DEBATE THIS RIGHT NOW. NOW I KNOW WHY HARRY REID DOESN'T WANT TO. HE THINKS OBAMA ALREADY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO WHATEVER THE HELL HE WANTS. BUT HOUSE SPEAKER BOEHNER, YOU BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT IS GOING ABOUT THIS ALL WRONG.
IF THE GOAL IS TO DESTROY ISIS AS THE PRESIDENT SAYS IT IS, I DON'T BELIEVE THE STRATEGY THAT HE OUTLIED WOULD ACCOMPLISH THAT.
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND PUTTING AMERICAN BOOTS ON THE GROUND?
WE HAVE NO CHOICE. THESE ARE BARBARIANS. THEY INTEND TO KILL US, AND IF WE DON'T DESTROY THEM FIRST, WE ARE GOING TO PAY THE PRICE.
Jon: SO THE PRESIDENT HAS THE WRONG STRATEGY TO DESTROY THE BARBARIANS WHO WILL KILL US ALL. THE BARBARIANS AT OUR GATE, OR NOT NECESSARILY OUR GATE BUT A FEW GATES AWAY AND THEN THERE'S OBVIOUSLY THE OCEAN. BUT THE POINT IS, SO I GET IT, BOEHNER, LET'S HAVE THE DEBATE AND WE NEED TO DO IT NOW.
JOHN BOEHNER SPEAK OF THE HOUSE SAID TODAY I THINK THE HOUSE AND CONGRESS ITSELF SHOULD SPEAK, BUT DOING THIS WITH A WHOLE GROUP OF MEMBERS WHO ARE ON THEIR WAY OUT THE DOOR, I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO HANDLE THIS. [LAUGHING]
Jon: YOU JUST SAID THE BARBARIANS WERE TRYING TO KILL US. SETTING ASIDE THAT THANKS TO INCUMBENCY FAVORING ELECTORIAL PRACTICES ROUGHLY 90% OF THE MEMBERS WHO ARE ON THEIR WAY OUT OF THE DOOR OF THESE MIDTERMS WILL BE COMING RIGHT BACK IN THROUGH THE DOOR. AND IF YOUR POINT IS THAT THESE ARE RUTHLESS BARBARIANS WHO THREATEN OUR VERY EXISTENCE AND MUST BE KILLED IMMEDIATELY BY THE NEW CONGRESS WHICH TAKES OVER IN JANUARY. I MEAN, IS THERE SOMEONE WHO COULD PERHAPS LAY OUT THE CYNICAL UNDER PINNINGS OF THIS POSITION BY OUR BRAVE CONGRESS.
JACK KINGSTON A REBULICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM GEORGIA HAD A VERY INTERESTING QUOTE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES YESTERDAY. SO, "A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO STAY ON THE SIDELINE AND SAY 'JUST BOMB THE PLACE AND TELL US ABOUT IT LATER .' IT'S A ELECTION YEAR. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS DON'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD PLAY IN THEIR PARTY. REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING. WE LIKE THE PATH WE'RE ON NOW. WE CAN DENOUNCE IF IT GOES BAD AND PRAISE IT IF IT GOES WELL AND ASK THEM WHAT TOOK HIM SO LONG.
Jon: HOLY [BEEP]. IN A TIME OF WAR OUR CONGRESSIONAL INACTION IS PURE POLITICAL CALCULATION. OUR LEGISLATORS REFUSE TO DEBATE PUBLICLY ONE OF THE MOST CRUCIAL ISSUES OF OUR TIME FOR FEAR WE WILL HEAR THEM. BUT FINALLY JACK KINGSTON HAS THE GUTS TO SAY OUT LOUD WHAT THESE COWARDS ARE UP TO. I WONDER WHY HE DECIDED TO SAY THESE THINGS.
LAST NIGHT DAVID PERDUE DEFEATED CONGRESSMAN JACK KINGSTON IN THE REPUBLICAN SENATE PRIMARY RUN OFF.
Jon: OH, HE SPOKE HONESTLY BECAUSE HE'S LEAVING CONGRESS. YOU KNOW WHAT, THE REST OF YOU [BEEP] EITHER GET BACK TO WASHINGTON AND DEBATE AND VOTE ON THIS THING OR ELSE MAYBE IT'S TIME TO TELL MOM WE'RE MOVING HOME. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
