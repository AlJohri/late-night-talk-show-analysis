FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT EXCELLENT PROGRAM TONIGHT. TONIGHT'S GUEST: THE LEGEND HIMSELF DR. BILL COSBY JOINS US A LITTLE BIT LATER. A GOOD MAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BREAKING NEWS OUT OF -- YEAH THAT'S RIGHT -- CANADA.
JUST INTO THE NEWS DESK, THE CRACK-SMOKING MAYOR OF TORONTO HAS JUST DONE IT AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ]
JON: WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR BRAND NEW SEGMENT "THIS JUST IN THE CRACK-SMOKING MAYOR OF TORONTO HAS JUST DONE IT AGAIN." [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] SO APPARENTLY -- THE CRACK-SMOKING MAYOR OF TORONTO HAS DONE IT AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE IS THE SENTENCE I'M ASSUMING DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT SENTENCE: SAVES THE DAY.
THE HOURS LONG CITY COUNCIL MEETING DETERIORATED INTO A SPECTACLE. MAYOR ROB FORD AT ONE POINT STARTED MOCKING A COUNCIL MEMBER SUSPECTED OF DRIVING DRUNK.
MAYOR FORD, STOP DISRUPTING.
AMID THE CHAOS HE NEARLY KNOCKED A COUNCILWOMAN TO THE GROUND AS HE RAN ACROSS THE ROOM. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: POOR WOMAN. YOU KNOW SHE GOT INTO POLITICS THINKING THIS MAY BE A DIRTY UNREWARDING BUSINESS BUT AT LEAST I'LL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GOING TO WORK AND BEING TRAMPLED BY A CRACKHEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THERE'S A REASON ROB FORD MAY HAVE BEEN WORKED UP BY THAT PARTICULAR CITY COUNCIL MEETING.
THE CITY COUNCIL IN TORONTO HAS JUST BEGUN DEBATING A MEASURE THAT WOULD STRIP ITS CRACK-SMOKING MAYOR OF MOST OF HIS POWERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WAIT, SMOKING CRACK GIVES YOU POWERS? [ LAUGHTER ] ARE THOSE POWERS AN UNQUENCHABLE THIRST FOR CRACK? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT ODDLY IN MAYOR FORD'S CASE WITH GREAT POWER COMES VERY LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY. HOW DID THE COUNCIL ATTEMPT TO STRIP HIM OF HIS POWERS TURN OUT?
FORD WENT DOWN 36 VOTES TO FIVE.
JON: FIVE VOTES. WHO VOTED TO CONTINUE TO GIVE THIS MAN POWER? [LAUGHTER] I IMAGINE HE MUST HAVE GIVEN AN EMPASSIONED DEFENSE.
HIS ANSWER?
THIS, FOLKS, REMINDS ME OF WHEN -- AND I WAS WATCHING WITH MY BROTHER-- WHEN SADDAM ATTACKED KUWAIT, YOU GUYS HAVE JUST ATTACKED KUWAIT AND YOU WILL NEVER -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THE REFERENCE MAY BE [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THE REFERENCE MAY BE DATED BUT IN ROB FORD'S DEFENSE IT MAY BE ONE OF LAST THINGS HE REMEMBERS. [LAUGHTER] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THERE WAS AN INVASION OF KUWAIT AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW AND I WOKE UP I WAS THE MAYOR. I DON'T KNOW HOW. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL THE VOTE YESTERDAY CAPPED OFF A HELL OF A COUPLE OF DAYS FOR ROB FORD INCLUDING AN INTERVIEW WITH CNN WHERE HE SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH SCHOOL CHILDREN AND SAID THIS.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF ALL THESE (bleep) EXCUSE MY WORDS. SORRY, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SWORN IN FRONT OF THE KIDS.
Jon: I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT I FEEL LIKE (bleep) FOR DO THAT. JEEZOUS ANOTHER (bleep) RIGHT THERE. THAT'S BAD. (bleep) SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I'M SUCH A (bleep). WHAT AM I DOING IN FRONT OF KIDS? [LAUGHTER] ROB FORD IS NOT IN DENIAL, SAYS ROB FORD. HE KNOWS HE IS NOT PERFECT.
THAT'S THE THING. I DON'T LOOK AT MYSELF AS THE MAYOR. I LOOK AT MYSELF AS JUST A NORMAL REGULAR PERSON.
Jon: THEN GO BACK TO BEING ONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AMAZINGLY AFTER THIS HE DOES AMAZHAVE A FEW SUPPORTERS IN TORONTO. YES.
TORONTO'S MAYOR ROB FORD HAS PROVIDED THE WORLD WITH A SERIES OF POLITICAL HIGHLIGHTS.
I WANT TO (bleep). I NEVER SAID THAT IN MY LIFE TO HER. I WOULD NEVER HAVE SAID THAT. I'M HAPPILY MARRIED. I HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO EAT AT HOME.
HAVE YOU PURCHASED ILLEGAL DRUGS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS? YES, I HAVE.
AND IN RESPONSE TO HIS BEHAVIOR THE CITY COUNCIL OF TORONTO VOTED 36-5 TO ASK ROB FORD TO LEAVE CITY HALL. I WENT TO TORONTO TO SEE WHO THE HELL WERE THESE FIVE PEOPLE AND WHY THEY DIDN'T DUMP THE MAYOR OUTRIGHT. HE SMOKED CRACK RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD US.
HE TALKED ABOUT EATING (bleep) IN A PRESS CONFERENCE.
I DIDN'T HEAR IT LIVE BUT IT HAD ONE OF THOSE WORDS BLEEPPED OUT.
HE DEFINITELY SAID (bleep).
I THINK THEY BLEEPED IT OUT AGAIN. WHY DID YOU VOTE AGAINST THE MOTION? WERE YOU ON CRACK AS WELL?
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MOTION IN ITS PART IT INVITES HIM TO LEAVE THAT'S THE GOOD PART. IT INVITES HIM TO COME BACK. I COULDN'T TOLERATE THAT.
SO THE MOTION WASN'T HARSH ENOUGH FOR PARKER. HE DID HAVE ANOTHER WAY TO PUNISH HIM.
WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE INTEGRITY COMMISSIONER.
DO YOU HAVE AN OBVIOUS COMMISSIONER LIKE THE (bleep) COUNCIL?
WE DIDN'T THINK WE NEEDED ANYTHING OF THE SORT.
IN AMERICA WE HAVE A TON OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS TYPE OF THING BUT TORONTO IS TRULY INCAPABLE OF DEALING WITH (bleep).
WE HAVE AN ELECTION NEXT FALL.
IN 2014?
2014.
WHAT IS THE WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM HERE?
PEOPLE CALL IT DEMOCRACY.
IT'S MORE LIKE A PUSSOCACRACY. NOBODY HAS THE BALLS TO DO SOMETHING AROUND HERE. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND ARE THE 25% OF TORONTOANS WHO SUPPORT HIM?
HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.
ROB FORD IS THE MOST FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE MAYOR WE'VE HAD IN THE CITY. EVERYTHING HE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO HE HAS GOTTEN DONE.
WAS IT WEIRD TO SAY RESPONSIBLE AND ROB FORD IN THE SAME SENTENCE.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH CRACK?
WHERE IT EFFECT HIS PERFORMANCE.
IS THIS TOO MUCH CRACK?
NO.
HOW ABOUT THIS IS THIS TOO MUCH CRACK?
I THINK THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH.
THERE'S A LINE BETWEEN A FUNCTIONING MAYOR AND A PROBLEM. WE'LL SEE IF HE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS MAYOR AND OH, LET'S SAY CHARLIE SHEEN. I AM A SICK (bleep), DUDE.
CHARLIE SHEEN.
WRONG IT'S ROB FORD. HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. YES, I HAVE SMOKED CRACK COCAINE BUT AM I AN ADDICT, NO, HAVE I TRIED IT PROBABLY IN A DRUNKEN STUPOR.
THAT WAS ROB FORD.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THESE CLOWNS. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THE JUDGMENT AND STUPIDITY. ROB FORD.
CHARLIE SHEEN.
SEEMS LIKE A ROB FORD.
I KNOW THEY ARE SO SIMILAR. PEOPLE WOULD STILL VOTE FOR ROB FORD IS IT MAYBE BECAUSE HIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT UNUSUAL IN TORONTO WORKPLACES.
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?
A SOY LATTE, PLEASE. ARE YOU SMOKING CRACK?
YES.
THIS IS THE MOST ANNOYINGLY POLITE PLACE ON EARTH. HE SAID I WANTED TO SUCK HIS (bleep). I WOULD NEVER DO THAT I HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH (bleep) TO SUCK AT HOME. NO ONE CONFRONTED ME ABOUT MY FORD-LIKE APPROACH TO WORK. MAYBE THIS CITY DESERVES THE MAYOR.
I THINK HE HAS MADE MISTAKES IN THE PAST.
REELECT HIM THE HOOD RAT STUFF IS IN THE PAST.
I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE PAST.
REELECT ROB FORD. THAT HOOD RAT SHIT IS IN THE PAST.
