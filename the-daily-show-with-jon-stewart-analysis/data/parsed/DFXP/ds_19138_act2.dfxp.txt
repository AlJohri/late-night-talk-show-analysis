Jon: WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. SO WHAT DID YOU GET YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER ON VALENTINE'S DAY? CAN YOU REMEMBER BACK THEN? FEBRUARY 14th. MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH. CHANCES ARE IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT RAY RICE GOT HIS FIANCEE.
RAY RICE IS CHARGED WITH ASSAULT AFTER AN ARGUMENT WITH HIS FIANCEE IN ATLANTIC CITY.
THE ALL-PRO SUPER BOWL WINNING RUNNING BACK HOVERING OVER AND THEN DRAGGING HIS THEN-GIRLFRIEND, NOW WIFE, UNCONSCIOUS OUT OF AN ELEVATOR AFTER HE PUNCHED HER IN THE FACE.
Jon: I STILL FIND SO IT STRANGE IN THAT VIDEO. RICE SEEMS TO BE GESTURING LIKE, HEY, ANYBODY HELP ME? THIS WOMAN SEEMS TO HAVE COLLAPSED. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE NFL WAS NONE TOO HAPPY, AS WAS EXPRESSED ON NFL'S OWN NETWORK.
HE'S ABOUT TO DEAL WITH THE IRON FIST OF THE NFL.
Jon: REALLY COULDN'T THINK OF A NON-FIST METAPHOR FOR THIS CASE? YOU REALLY, YOU REALLY HAD TO GO WITH IRON FIST? UNLESS RICE IS GOING TO BE PUNISHED BY CLETUS THE ROBOT, YOU MIGHT WANT TO REPHRASE IT. BUT LET'S GET TO THE PUNISHMENT. IS HE EXPELLED FOR ETERNITY OR LONGER?
THE NFL HAS OFFICIALLY HANDED DOWN ITS JUDGMENT ON RICE'S OFF-SEASON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENT. THE BALTIMORE RAVENS' STAR WAS SUSPENDED TWO GAMES BY COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL. [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: THEY'RE NOT OOHING BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S A LOT. TWO GAMES? WELL, UNLESS ONE OF THE GAMES IS PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL, WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE DO YOU THINK THIS IS SENDING?
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO ALL INVOLVED THAT THE NFL DOES NOT CONDONE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN ANY WAY AND WILL NOT TOLERATE IT IN OUR LEAGUE.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO WHO? [LAUGHTER] THE LEAGUE SUSPENDS YOU FOR FOUR GAMES IF YOU GET CAUGHT SMOKING POT, WHICH IS ACTUALLY LEGAL IN ONE OF THE CITIES THE NFL OPERATES IN. TO BE CLEAR, THE NFL SUSPENDS YOU FOR TWICE AS LONG IF WHAT YOU HIT IS THIS. [LAUGHTER] ESPN SUSPENDED THIS GUY FOR A WEEK JUST FOR TALKING ABOUT IT WRONG. AND THEN THERE'S THIS:
ONE ROOKIE GOT A FIVE-GAME SUSPENSION FOR TAKING FREEBIES IN COLLEGE.
Jon: FIVE GAMES FOR TAKING FREEBIES. UNLESS FREEBIE IS ANOTHER WORD FOR COLD COCKING YOUR FIANCEE, THE NFL PENAL CODE MIGHT NEED SOME TWEAKING. IN FACT, LET'S BE HONEST, NFL, THIS CASE PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN BE GETTING THE ATTENTION IT HAS IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON CAMERA. THE ONLY REASON THE NFL EVEN FLAGGED IT IS BECAUSE WE HAD INSTANT REPLAY IN THIS CASE. I JUST HOPE RAY RICE UNDERSTANDS THE SEVERITY OF WHAT HE'S DONE, EVEN IF THE NFL DOESN'T.
I APOLOGIZE TO MY FANS, MY... TO THE KIDS, TO EVERYONE WHO WAS AFFECTED, YOU KNOW, BY THIS SITUATION THAT ME AND MY WIFE WERE IN. I WON'T CALL MYSELF A FAILURE. FAILURE IS NOT GETTING KNOCKED DOWN, IT'S NOT GETTING UP.
Jon: WHAT IS WITH THE VIOLENT METAPHORS? [LAUGHTER] THE IRON FIST, THE KNOCK DOWN, THE GETTING UP. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER. IT'S NOT APPLICABLE, BUT AT LEAST NOBODY'S GETTING HIT IN YOUR METAPHOR. NO SENSE CRYING OVER SPILLED MILK. OUR LANGUAGE IS RICH IN NON-VIOLENT IMAGERY. LISTEN, FOR MORE WE TURN TO SENIOR SPORTS CORRESPONDENT JASON JONES. JASON, WELCOME. JASON, THIS IS, THIS IS NOT A HARSH PUNISHMENT.
JON, WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT FROM THIS LEAGUE? IT IGNORES HEINOUS ACTIONS. IT COVERS UP THE INJURIES THE GAME INFLICTS ON THE PLAYERS AND IT REGULARLY SCREWS OVER TAXPAYERS ON STADIUM AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEALS. IT IS TIME TO SAY IT: THE NFL IS A MORALLY, INDEFENSIBLE ORGANIZATION. OF COURSE, THAT BEING SAID, MAN AM I GLAD TRAINING CAMPS ARE BACK. I AM READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL!
Jon: WHAT?
A SUNDAY NIGHT PARTY. WHOO!
Jon: JASON, YOU JUST LAID OUT, IN MY ESTIMATION, AN ELOQUENT ...
UH-HUH.
Jon:, AN INCREDIBLE CASE AGAINST THE ETHICS AND THE MORALITY OF THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
YEAH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO START UP AGAIN.
YEAH, YEAH. IT'S A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE ORGANIZATION, BUT I ALREADY ORDERED THE PARTY SUBS FOR OPENNING WEEKEND. SO INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT, BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING DO?
Jon: YOU COULD FOLLOW THROUGH, JASON, WITH YOUR CONVICTIONS HERE, WHICH ARE WELL TAKEN.
OH, OH, OKAY, SO, SO NO MORE GIANTS GAMES FOR YOU THEN, JON?
Jon: YES, YES. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY IF IT'S ON IN THE BACKGROUND. [LAUGHTER] OF THE SPORTS BAR THAT I'M IN,
RIGHT.
Jon: I CAN'T ASK THEM TO TURN iT OFF JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO WATCH THE NEW OFFENSE THE GIANTS HAVE INSTALLED WITH MACADOO AND A SHORTER PASSING GAME, HIGHER COMPLETION PERCENTAGES. COME ON, ELI, YOU CAN DO THIS.
YES! EXACTLY! AND I WILL SEE YOU AT MY HOUSE FOR KICKOFF. OKAY. BRING BEER AND FOOD AND A TV. OKAY. [BLEEPED] IT, LET'S DO IT AT YOUR HOUSE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, JASON. JASON JONES, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
