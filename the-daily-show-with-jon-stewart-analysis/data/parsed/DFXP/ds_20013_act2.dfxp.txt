[ Cheering and Applause ]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. ALL RIGHT, TEXAS. ALL RIGHT, TEXAS. LET ME GIVE YOU YOUR PROPERS. YOU DID A NICE JOB HANDLING YOUR EBOLA. YOU TRIED TO STAY CALM, YOU GOT YOUR HOSPITAL CARE TOGETHER EVENTUALLY. BUT LET'S FACE FACTS, NOW THAT EBOLA IS IN NEW YORK CITY WE CAN LET THE BIG DOGS SHOW YOU HOW WE HANDLE AN AFRICAN BLOOD POOP VIRUS.
THE EBOLA CASE IN NEW YORK, A CITY OF MORE THAN 8 MILLION.
EBOLA IN THE BIG APPLE.
EBOLA IN NEW YORK CITY TONIGHT COULD IT ALSO BE IN NEW JERSEY.
IT ARRIVED VIA A DOCTOR.
WAS THE DOCTOR CONTAGIOUS WHEN HE WENT BOWLING?
WHO KNOWS WHETHER HE USED THE BATHROOM FACILITIES.
HE USED THE SUBWAYS. TOOK AN UBER CAR.
CAME DOWN WITH A 103 FEVER.
THIS DISEASE IS FIERCE.
DID HIS ACTIONS PUT THE PUBLIC AT RISK?
Jon: SEE, CALM, COOL AND CATCH THAT DOCTOR AND KILL HIM! ALL RIGHT, I GUESS WE IN NEW YORK LOST OUR HEADS FOR A SECOND. SO A DOCTOR WHO TREATED EBOLA PATIENTS IN AFRICA CAME BACK AND GOT HIMSELF EBOLA AND [BLEEP] HIS WAY THROUGH THE "SEX AND THE CITY" TOUR IN MANHATTAN WITH A 103 DEGREE FEVER.
WE WERE TOLD YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS 103 IT WAS ACTUALLY 100.3.
Jon: DIDN'T ANYONE TREATING HIM DOUBLE CHECK IT AND SEE? THAT HE HAD A FEVER OF 100.3? BECAUSE FROM THE LOOKS OF IT THIS MAN IS HOT BLOODED. BECAUSE FROM THE LOOKS OF IT THIS MAN IS HOT BLOODED. ALL RIGHT. SO MAYBE -- NICE TO HAVE AN OLDER AUDIENCE FOR A CHANGE. ALL RIGHT. SO MAYBE THIS DOCTOR GALLIVANTED AROUND THE CITY, BUT COME ON, HOW MUCH GALLIVANTING COULD ONE GUY WITH EBOLA DO IN JUST A DAY OR TWO?
TUESDAY SPENCER FELT SLUGGISH. THE NEXT DAY FEELING WELL ENOUGH FOR A THREE MILE JOG STOPPING AT BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE ON THE HIGH LINE AND THE MEATBALL SHOP IN GREENWICH VILLAGE. THEN TAKING THE SUBWAY FROM MANHATTAN TO BROOKLYN. VISITING A BOWLING ALLEY CALLED THE GUTTER.
Jon: WHY IS EBOLA'S GUY'S LIFE SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN MINE? THE JOGGING, THE MEATBALLS, THE BOWLING. THAT'S NOT A PATIENT HISTORY THAT'S A TINDR PROFILE. FOR GOD'S SAKES! IF YOU GOT A FEVER FOR LOVE, SWIPE RIGHT! WHO KNOWS HOW MANY INNOCENT NEW YORKERS THIS MAN INFECTED IN THAT, ALBEIT, AWESOME DAY.
UNLESS YOU HAD SEX WITH HIM, AT THE BOWLING ALLEY, YOU WEREN'T GOING TO GET EBOLA. [ Laughter ]
Jon: I THINK I NEED TO CALL MY DOCTOR. [ Applause ] I BELIEVE THAT JOKE INTIMATED THAT I [BLEEP] THE EBOLA DOCTOR. ALL RIGHT. SO MAYBE THE DISEASE LESS DANGEROUS AND DEVASTATING THAT THE MEDIA HAS LED US TO BELIEVE I'M SURE THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE TAKING A MEASURED APPROACH.
GOVERNORS CUOMO AND CHRISTIE NOW MANDATING A 21 DAY QUARANTINE FOR TRAVELERS IN TO THE U.S. CONSIDERED HIGH RISK. THE FEMALE HEALTH CARE WORKER RETURNING FROM AFRICA WHO TOOK CARE OF EBOLA PATIENTS WAS PLACED ON LEGAL QUARANTINE.
GOVERNOR CHRISTIE HAS SAID AT A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT SHE IS ILL.
FIRST OF ALL I DON'T THINK HE'S A DOCTOR. AND SECONDLY HE'S NEVER LAID EYES ON ME. AND THIRDLY, I HAVE BEEN ASYMPTOMATIC SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.
I THINK WHEN SHE HAS TIME TO REFLECT SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.
Jon: WHY DOES CHRISTIE HAS TO BE SUCH A DICK ABOUT EVERYTHING? YOU KNOW, HE CAN'T JUST QUARANTINE HER. -- WHY CAN'T HE JUST -- ALL RIGHT, YOU DID THE QUARANTINE, BUT HE CAN'T JUST QUARANTINE SOMEONE. HE HAS TO BE LIKE YOU'RE A DOCTOR WITHOUT BORDERS, NOT ANY MORE, GET IN THE [BLEEP] ROOM. YOU SELF SACRIFICING ANGEL OF MERCY PIECE OF [BLEEP] I GOT YOUR ALTRUISM RIGHT HERE. THIS WOMAN PUT HER LIFE ON THE LINE TO HELP DYING PATIENTS. I AT LEAST HOPE EVERY EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO KEEP HER QUARANTINE COMFORTABLE.
HICKOX'S ATTORNEY, SEEN HERE TALKING TO HIS CLIENT THROUGH A TENT WINDOW SAYS HE PLANS TO FILE A FEDERAL LAWSUIT IF SHE'S NOT RELEASED SOON. WE'RE TOLD ITS UNHEATED, WITH NO SHOWER AND ONLY A BOX FOR A TOILET.
Jon: YOU KNOW, I GOT TO SAY, A TENT WITH NO HEAT, NO SHOWER AND A [BLEEP] BOX. I STILL THINK MOST NEW YORKERS WOULD BE LIKE, WHAT'S THE SQUARE FOOTAGE? WHAT'S THE RENT? [ Applause ] IS THERE A BROKER'S FEE? I'LL TAKE IT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, SO MAYBE THE QUARANTINE IS A BIT OF AN OVER REACTION. OR AS OUR FREEDOM PERSONAL LIBERTY-LOVIN' CONGRESS CALLS IT, GOVERNMENT UNDERREACH.
WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT TRAVEL BANS.
LET'S SET UP SOMETHING LIKE A FORWARD OPERATING BASE HAVE PEOPLE REPORT 21 DAYS BEFORE THEY'RE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.
STAY AWAY FROM PEOPLE, NO CLOSER THAN SIX FEET.
DOCTOR, YOU CAN GET EBOLA SITTING NEXT TO SOMEONE ON A BUS IF THEY IN FACT THROW UP ON YOU, CAN'T YOU? [ Applause ]
Jon: DOCTOR, LET ME ASK YOU THIS, WHAT IF YOU ARE YAWNING, GUY RUNS UP THROWS HIS EBOLA DIARRHEA RIGHT IN YOUR MOUTH. BOOM! EBOLA IN THE MOUTH, BOOM. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THEN? ALL RIGHT. I STAND CORRECTED. I GUESS QUARANTINE AND TRAVEL BANS ARE THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT THE DISEASE.
THE IDEA OF A BLANKET QUARANTINE FOR PEOPLE WHO COME BACK COULD POSSIBLY HAVE A NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE OF ESSENTIALLY DISINCENTIVISING PEOPLE FROM WANTING TO GO THERE. THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT AMERICANS IS TO STOP THE EPIDEMIC IN AFRICA, AND WE NEED THOSE HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO DO THAT.
Jon: SHUT UP, SCIENCE. WE GOT RUNNING AROUND TO DO. WHAT IS WRONG WITH US? WE WERE THE HOME OF THE BRAVE. OR DOES THE SONG GO, OR THE LAND OF THE FREE? UNLESS YOU HAVE A FEVER? IN WHICH CASE WE PREFER YOU GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE. HERE'S HOW TRULY PATHETIC WE ARE. HERE IS HOW CALMLY THEY'RE REPORTING ON EBOLA ON THE GHANA BROADCASTING CORPORATION. GHANA! IT'S JUST TWO SMALL COUNTRIES OVER FROM EBOLA LAND.
A THREE DAY CURFEW HAS BEGUN IN SIERRA LEONE TO ENABLE HEALTH WORKERS TO FIND AND ISOLATE CASES OF EBOLA IN ORDER TO HALT THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE.
Jon: OH CALM AND INFORMATIONAL. OF COURSE THAT LADY'S CALM AND INFORMATIONAL. SHE'S IN GHANA. EBOLA WOULD HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE IVORY COAST TO GET TO HER. SHE DOESN'T NEED TO PANIC. YOU KNOW I THINK PERHAPS EBOLA IS TEACHING US AN IRONIC YET RELEVANT LESSON.  ♪♪ SUBMITTED FOR YOUR APPROVAL. A NATION GRIPPED BY FEAR OF AN OUTBREAK. [ Laughter ] AND YET ALL THIS TIME THE REAL VIRUS OUTBREAK MENACING THEM WAS FEAR. [ Laughter ] I MISS YOU SO MUCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
