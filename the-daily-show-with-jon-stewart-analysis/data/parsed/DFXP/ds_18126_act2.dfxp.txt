WELCOME BACK. I KNOW THAT I AM NOT ALONE AND  EXCITEDLY AWAITING THE MOST  IMPORTANT EVENT IN WORLD  HISTORY.
THE SUSPECTED DUE DATE OF THE  ROYAL HARE HAS COME AND GONE  HERE IN LONDON AND STILL NO BABY JUST YET.
John: NO, NO, NO, NO STORY. I REFUSE TO WAIT ANY LONGER. WE'RE KICKING OFF OUR COVERAGE. ROLL IT. OKAY. OKAY. SO, OKAY. I GUESS THE KEY QUESTION NOW IS  WHERE IS MY [BLEEP] BABY?
SOMEONE ELSE AT THE PALACE  SAID IT COULD BE NEXT WEEK, NEXT  TUESDAY.
BY THE END OF THE WEEK HE OR  SHE WILL BE BORN.
John: YOU'RE RIGHT. WE SHOULD NOT BE RUSHING THIS. IT TAKES NINE MONTHS JUST TO  MAKE A COMMON BABY. A ROYAL INFANT NEEDS TO STEEP  FOR A YEAR, MAYBE TWO, MATURING  LIKE A FINE CLARET BEFORE SAUNTERING OUT OF THE WOMB IN  FORMAL DRESS AND SAYING I'M  SORRY, WERE YOU WAITING FOR ME? I MUST BE FASHIONABLY LATE. YOU KNOW, I'M EXCITED JUST  COVERING THE BIRTH FROM HERE. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE THRILL OF  REPORTING IT LIVE FROM LONDON.
THE COUNTRY IS DOING WHAT  WILLIAM AND KATE ARE DOING. FRANKLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS  WAITING.
GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW LONG  YOU'LL BE STANDING OUTSIDE THAT  HOSPITAL. WE HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LONG.
PLEASE, WILLIE, DON'T JINX  ME. MY FINGERS ARE CROSSED.
THE SUN IS GETTING TO US A  BIT, CAROL. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WE NEED THIS  BABY TO COME SOONER RATHER THAN  LATER. LET'S JUST SAY THAT.
John: I'M SORRY. FOR YOU IT'S SUCH HARD WORK  STANDING AROUND WAITING FOR  SOMEONE ELSE TO PUSH A  NINE-POUND HUMAN OUT OF HER GOLDEN VAGINA. HOW CAN YOU BE SO JADED ABOUT  THIS? IT'S NOT JUST A ROYAL BIRTH  THAT'S EXCITING. IT'S HOW IT'S ANNOUNCED.
A BIRTH NOTICE WILL BE  WRITTEN AT THE HOSPITAL. THE NOTICE WILL BE DRIVEN BY A  POLICE ESCORT FROM THE LINDO  WING AT ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE. AND THEN TWO SIMULTANEOUS BUT  SEPARATE GUN SALUTES. AND 62-ROUND SALUTE AT THE TOWER  OF LONDON.
John: THAT'S RIGHT. CANNONS, MOTHER [BLEEP]. HOW ABOUT THAT. CANNONS. LET ME ASK YOU. AT BEST SHE GOT NICK CAN NONE,  THAN THAT IS IS NOT AS GOOD. NOW, NORMALLY WHEN WE BRITISH  PUBLIC GET WORKED UP, WE RIOT. BUT THIS IS A MUCH MORE  DIGNIFIED OCCASION.
I JUST THINK IT'S EXCITING. T WILL BE EXCITING TO SEE  HOW THE QUEEN REACTS.
REASON ENOUGH FOR THE  EXPECTANT PUBLIC TO LOOK ITS  BEST.
John: IT'S RESPECTFUL. ISN'T IT? I CAN'T MEET A ROYAL BABY WITH  PEACH FUZZ. WHAT IF HE WANTS TO TOUCH ME  FACE? LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, YOUR ROYAL  HIGHNESS, THOSE OTHERS MIGHT BE  GETTING BORED WAITING BUT I CAN DO THIS ALL DAY. I AM NOT LEAVING THIS DESK UNTIL  YOU HAVE THAT BABY. I AM IN THIS FOR THE LONG HAUL. YOUR MOVE, PRINCESS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
