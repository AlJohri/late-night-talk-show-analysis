FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN  NEW YORK, IN IS DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW! I'M JOHN OLIVER, STILL HERE  FOR JON STEWART WHO IS  SPENDING THE SUMMER ON AN  EAT, PRAY, LOVE, STYLE JOURNEY TO FIND HIMSELF. I THINK HE'S CURRENTLY AT  THE POINT WHERE HE'S SLEEPING  WITH JAVIER BAR DEM. OUR GUEST IS NEWS LEGEND TOM  BROKAW IS HERE. (APPLAUSE)
THE KING OF NEWS. LOOK, WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH  FISCAL POLICY, THERE IS,  PERHAPS, NO ISSUE MORE  SERIOUS THAN THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF FED CHAIRMAN BEN  BERNANKE'S LOW-INTEREST RATE  POLICIES. AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE GOING  TO BE DEVOTING THIS ENTIRE  SHOW TONIGHT TO FULLY  ANALYZE-- I'M SORRY? I'M BEING TOLD THERE IS A  BREAKING STORY YOU PITE  ACTUALLY CARE TO HEAR ABOUT.
CELEBRITY CHEF PAULA DEEN  IS DEFENDING HERSELF AFTER  ADMITTING THAT YEARS AGO SHE USED THE "N" WORD.
THE "N" WORD? WHICH ONE DID SHE USE  BECAUSE I KNOW IT WASN'T  NONFAT. BOOM! OH, OH, PAULA DEEN IS THE  ONLY CHEF TO RECEIVE AN A  RATING FROM THE AMERICAN  LARD COUNSEL. BOOM BOOM. I CAN DO THIS ALL NIGHT, BUT  HONESTLY, I FIND THESE  ALLEGATIONS DIFFICULT TO  BELIEVE. NOW PAULA DEEN SEEMS SO NICE  ON HER TV CHEF SHOW WITH HER  FRIENDLY SOFT SOUTHERN  CHARM. EXACTLY HOW BAD IS THIS?
IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH A  TRANSCRIPT OF A VIDEOTAPED  DEPOSITION, PART OF AN ONGOING CIVIL LAWSUIT FILED  AGAINST DEEN AND HER BROTHER  BY A FORMER EMPLOYEE WHO AS YOU MENTIONED ALLEGES SEXUAL  AND RACIAL HARASSMENT. NOW ACCORD TOGETHER  DEPOSITION DEEN WAS ASKED  HAVE YOU EVER USED THE "N"  WORD YOURSELF, TO WHICH SHE REPLIES YES, OF COURSE.
OF COURSE I HAVE. I MEAN OF COURSE I HAVE. I TALK SO NICE. I MEAN I DO HAVE A MOUTH. SO I'M GOING TO USE THE "N"  WORD, THAT'S JUST A GIVEN. COME ON! BUT LOOK, THAT DOESN'T  NECESSARILY MEAN-- THAT  DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN  THAT PAULA DEEN IS A RACIST. MAYBE THE WORD JUST SLIPPED  OUT WHEN SHE WAS RAPPING  ALONG TO THE WU TANG CLAN IN SOME SORT OF INNOCENT CAR  YOKE MISHAP, RIGHT?
THE LAWSUIT AGAINST DEEN  FILED BY A FORMER EMPLOYEE  AT ONE OF HER RESTAURANTS ALSO CLAIMS SHE USED THE "N"  WORD TO DESCRIBE BLACK  WAITERS SHE SUPPOSEDLY  WANTED TO HIRE FOR A PLANTATION-THEMED WEDDING.
OH BOY. THE BUTTER BASED GUMBO  THICKENS. ALTHOUGH, ALTHOUGH LET'S  ACCEPT THE CIVIL WAR  PLANTATION WEDDING DOES  SOUND VERY ROMANTIC. EVERYONE DRESSED IN CRISP  WHITE LINEN AND INSTEAD OF  RINGS THE BRIDE AND GROOM  EXCHANGE SLAVES, AND AFTER THE RECEPTION THE UNION ARMY  COMES THROUGH AND BURNS  EVERYTHING TO THE GROUND. A DAY THAT NO ONE WOULD SOON  FORGET. OF COURSE THIS ISN'T THE  FIRST TIME THAT PAULA DEEN  HAS HAD TO DEFEND HER  ACTIONS.
DEEN IS NO STRANGER TO  PUBLIC CRITICISM. IN 2012 THE CHEF KNOWN FOR  USING GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF  BUTTER IN HER RECIPES  ANNOUNCE SHE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE II  DIABETES.
NOW, NOW, I KNOW THAT  LOOKS DISGUSTING. BUT DON'T WORRY, IT'S NOT  BUTTER, THAT'S JUST PAULA  DEEN'S URINE WHICH-- WHICH, WHICH TO BE FAIR, AT THIS  POINT IS ABOUT 85% BUTTER. BOOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS  I'M NOT SURPRISED SHE WAS  DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES. I'M SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T  RENAME DIABETES THE PAULA  DEEN SYNDROME.
MACARONI AND CHEESE, I  WILL WRAP IT IF BACON AND  WE'RE GOING TO DEEP-FRY IT.
YUMMY FRIED CHEESE STEAK. I WILL FINISH MAKING LOVE TO  MY TATER.
IN ENGLAND WE CALL THAT  BANGING YOUR MASH. THAT DOES ACTUALLY STAND TO  REASON EVERY ITEM THAT COMES  OUT OF HER KITCHEN IS  COMPLETELY [BLEEP]. NOW THIS IS SUCH A RICH  COMEDIC BUFF AYE. I THINK I MIGHT-- BUFFET, I  THINK I MIGHT BE FULL OF  PAULA DEEN JOKES, LET ME  JUST SETTLE MY STOMACH A LITTLE BIT THERE. THAT HELPSMENT I DON'T KNOW  IF I CAN EVEN STUFF IN  ANOTHER SLICE OF THIS STORY. MAYBE JUST ONE EXTRA DETAIL,  JUST ONE. MAYBE THE REASON THAT SHE  THOUGHT SHE SHOULD HAVE AN  ALL-BLACK WAIT STAFF AT A  PLANTATION WEDDING.
DEEN TALKS ABOUT A  RESTAURANT SHE AND HER  HUSBAND VISITED WHERE SHE  SAYS THE WAITERS WERE MIDDLE-AGED BLACK MEN  WEARING WHITE JACKETS AND  BLACK BOW TIES. SHE WAS ASKED IF THERE WAS  ANY POSSIBILITY THAT SHE  SLIPPED AND USED THE "N"  WORD WHEN DISCUSSING HER EXPERIENCE AT THE RESTAURANT  TO WHICH SHE REPLIED, NO. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT  THESE MEN WERE. THEY WERE PROFESSIONAL BLACK  MEN DOING A FABULOUS JOB. THAT'S NOT WHAT THESE MEN  WERE. NOT THESE PARTICULAR ONES? YOU KNOW, PAULA THERE IS A  REASON THAT CHRIS ROCK CAN  DO A ROUTINE ABOUT THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLACK PEOPLE AND N WORDS. AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO LOOK  AT THE PICTURE AND TRY TO  FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT-- I'M JUST WORRIED THAT  YOU GET CONFUSED ABOUT WHY  HE'S NOT WEARING A WHITE JACKET AND BLACK BOW TIE. WHAT? I THINK--   (APPLAUSE)  I THINK WE MAY HAVE FOUND  THE INTERNET'S NEW MENTOS  GAME. BUT WITH THE UGLYNESS OF THE  DEPOSITION, THE BIG QUESTION  IS CAN PAULA DEEN'S CAREER  SURVIVE.
AMERICA IS A COUNTRY THAT  IS WILLING TO FORGIVE. WHAT SHE'S GOT TO DO IS  SOMEHOW SHOW THAT SUNNY SIDE  AND SHOW PEOPLE THAT THIS IS NOT THE REAL PAULA DEEN.
YEAH, THE HOPE IS THAT  AMERICA WON'T THINK OF HER  AS PAULA DEEN THE CASUAL RACIST BUT MORE AS PAULA  DEEN, THE WOMAN WHO DRINKS  SAUCE OFF HER PLATE. FOR MORE ON THIS WE ARE  JOINED BY JESSICA WILLIAMS. JESSICA.
HI. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PAULA DEEN CLEARLY HAS  SAID SOME PROFOUNDLY  OFFENSIVE THINGS. WHAT IS NEXT?
JOHN, I THINK WE ALL NEED  TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND CALM  DOWN. THIS WOMAN HAS A VERY  SERIOUS CONDITION.
THAT'S RIGHT, WE  MENTIONED THAT EARLIER. SHE HAS DIABETES.
NO, NO, NO. I'M TALKING ABOUT HERR  DISEASE. PAULA CLEARLY SUFFERS FROM  EITHER TYPE 1 OR TYPE II  RACISM.
WOW, I DIDN'T REALIZE  THERE WERE TWO DISTINCT  TYPES.
THAT'S RIGHT. TYPE 1 RACISM IS INHERITED. IT RUNS IN FAMILIES. AND THERE IS REASON TO  BELIEVE THAT DEEN'S ANCESTORS  HAD A STRONG STRAIN OF THE RACISM GENE. SHE RECENTLY WENT ON A  GENIOLOGY SHOW AND FOUND OUT  ABOUT SOME FAMILY HEIRLOOMS.
LET ME SHOW YOU THIS  DOCUMENT HERE, SEE.
SLAVE INHABITANTS. 35, THAT'S A LOT.
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE  IS A LOT? ONE, ONE SLAVE IS A LOT OF  SLAVES, PAULA GENE. JUST ONE, ONE. (APPLAUSE)
THAT'S FAIR. SO IF HER FAMILY-OWNED  SLAVES THAT'S PRETTY STRONG  EVIDENCE THAT HER RACISM IS  TYPE 1.
NO, IT COULD STILL BE  TYPE II.
WHAT IS THAT, THAT IS  ADULT ONSET RACISM.
EXACTLY. THAT'S A LIFESTYLE DISEASE  THAT YOU DEVELOP ONLY AFTER  YEARS OF CLOGGING YOUR BRAIN VEINS WITH PURE SATURATED  DIXIE NOSTALGIA.
IS THERE A CURE.
NO, BUT DONE WORRY THESE  DAYS RACISM IS RARELY FATAL  DEFEND-- DEPENDING ON WHO YOU EXPRESS IT IN FRONT OF. EVEN IF ARE YOU DIAGNOSED  LATE LIKE PAULA YOU CAN  STILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY  AND MANAGE YOUR SYMPTOMS.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT. HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT.
WELL, TREATMENT OF RACISM  HAS COME A LONG WAY. TODAY PEOPLE LIKE PAULA CAN  CONTROL THEIR RACISM  CRAVINGS WITH A NIGGERETTE  PATCH.
I'M SORRY, I THINK  MAYBE --
NO, A NIGGERETTE PATCH.
OH BOY.
YOU CAN GET THEM  OVER-THE-COUNTER AT ANY  STUCKEYS OR PIGGLY WIGGLYLY. YOU SEE THE PATCH HELPS TO  SUPPRESS THE WORD TO BLURT  OUT ANYTHING OFFENSIVE BY REGULATING ACTIVITY IN THE  BRAIN'S RACISM CENTER KNOWNS  AS THE ANYDDALA.
YOU ARE SAYING WITH HELP  PAULA DEEN COULD LIVE A FULL  NORMAL LIFE.
SURE, AT LEAST UNTIL SHE  CLOAKED ON A SAUSAGE FRITTER  OR VAT OF BUTTER.
THANKS, JESS KA. YOU HAVE SHOWN REMARKABLE  SYMPATHY FOR SOMEONE WHO  SAID SUCH HORRIBLE HURTFUL  THINGS.
PLEASE, PAULA DEEN'S  PEOPLE AREN'T HURTING BLACK  PEOPLE AS MUCH AS HER RECIPES ARE.
THAT'S A FAIR POINT,  JESSICA WILLIAMS, EVERYONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BAC
