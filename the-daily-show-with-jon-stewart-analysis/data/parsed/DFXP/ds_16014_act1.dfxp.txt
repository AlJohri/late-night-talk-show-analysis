JANUARY 25, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT -- OH, YOU'RE IN FOR A TREAT. YOU'RE IN FOR A TREAT. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACTOR BY THE NAME OF JAMES FRANCO. AS OF TODAY AN ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE FOR HIS ACTING IN "127 HOURS". HE'S A TALENTED YOUNG ACTOR. HE HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE AHEAD OF HIM. WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE HIM. THAT SOUNDED LIKE IT CAME FROM THE GREEN ROOM. JAMES TPROEFRPBGO, IS -- FRANCO IS THAT YOU?
JON, I WAS TRYING TO GET A FUN-SIZED SNICKER BAR OUT OF MINI FRIDGE AND IT CAME DOWN ON ME. I CAN'T GET MY ARM OUT.
Jon: JAMES, CAN YOU GET YOUR ARM FREE?
I CAN'T MOVE IT. IT WON'T MOVE. I'M ALONE IN HERE. I'M GOING TO DIE. NOBODY KNOWS I'M HERE.
Jon: IT'S BASIC CABLE BUT SOME PEOPLE WILL STILL SEE YOU.
NO ONE IS GOING TO FIND ME HERE. THIS IS THE END. JON.
Jon: HANG IN THERE, JAMES. DON'T DO ANYTHING RASH. WE'LL CHECK IN ON YOU LATER. TERRIBLY SORRY. I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OBVIOUSLY -- HE REALLIES HAD A TO BE -- REALLY HAS TO BE MORE CAREFUL. OBVIOUSLY TONIGHT WAS THE STATE OF THE UNION, WOW, WHERE BARACK OBAMA SHOCKED THE NATION --  [LAUGHTER] -- BY CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE DEPORTATION OF ALL THOSE IN THIS COUNTRY WITH, AND I'M QUOTING  HERE "AMONG -- MONGREL FRENCH BLOOD." AND HE RETURNED TO THE STATUTE  OF LIBERTY AS THAT (bleep) GREEN -- THAT CAUGHT EVERYONE OFF GUARD. WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN CHICAGO, THE CITY OF BROAD SHOULDERS, THE BRAWLING HOME OF GANGSTERS, TOUGH GUYS AND FOOD THAT WOULD KILL I MAN JUST AS SOON AS LOOK AT HIM. SEE THAT SANDWICH? WE'VE GOT A NAME FOR THAT SANDWICH IN CHICAGO, IT'S CALLED THE LITTLE BALLERINA SANDWICH. THEY LIKE TO EAT. [LAUGHTER] FOR DECADES IT WAS RULED BY THE IRON FIST OF MAYOR J.DALEY FOLLOWED BY HIS SON. THIS YEAR THE SEAT IS OPEN AND ONE CANDIDATE SEEMS UNIQUELY CALLIFIED TO PULL THE TOMMY GUNN  FROM THE STONE AND CLAIM HIS PLACE.
RAHM EMANUEL IS KNOWN|ï¿½ï¿½i FOR A TOUGH STYLE.
KNOWN FOR HIS TAKE NO PRISONERS STYLE.
NOT AFRAID TO DROP F-BOMBS ALONG THE WAY.
I GUESS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS HE IS KIND OF A PRICK. I THAT'S THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. EVEN HIS COMPLAIN SLOGAN SEEMS RIGHT FOR THE CITY AND THE TIME. CHANGE YOU (bleep) CAN BELIEVE IN. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHY HAVE THE ELECTION. LET'S CALL HIM MR. MAYOR.|ï¿½
STUNNING DEVELOPMENT RAHM EMANUEL HAS BEEN THROWN OFF THE BATTLE.
THEY FOUND THE TRAIL OF MUTILATED HENCHMEN LEFT IN THE WAKE OF HIS LUST FOR POWER, HUMAN PARTS EMBEDDED IN THE FOUNDATION OF CHICAGO'S TALLEST BUILDING. MAYBE CONFUSING THIS WITH A BATMAN EPISODE I SAW OR RAHM'S BROTHER ARI. BOOM! I BET THEY GOT SOMETHING BAD ON HIM.
THE ISSUE IS WHETHER HE MEETS THE STATE LAW REQUIREMENT THAT ANY CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR BE A  RESIDENT FOR A YEAR BEFORE THE ELECTION.
Jon: THE CHICAGOAN. NO, THAT'S NOT THE CHICAGO WAY. IT'S NOT THEY BRING YOU AYOU KNIFE YOU BRING A GUN NOT YOU BRING A BRIEF BASED ON THE COOK  COUNTY CODE. RAHM HAS ALWAYS LIVED IN CHICAGO BUT HE WENT TO WORK AS THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF. WHILE HE WAS THERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. HE RENTED OUT HIS HOUSE TO PEOPLE WHO DECIDED  THAT WHEN RAHM WANTED TO COME BACK TO RUN FOR MAYOR THEY WOULDN'T LET HIM HAVE THE HOUSE BACK. BY THE WAY --
THE CHICAGO WAY.
Jon: YEAH. THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE DOESN'T HAVE EVIDENCE OF HIS CONTINUED INTENT TO RESIDE IN CHICAGO. ONE WAY HE COULD PROVE IT IS THAT HE LEFT HIS WIFE'S WE HAD BEGUN DRESS AT THEIR -- WEDDING  DRESS AT THEIR HOUSE.
THERE'S ALSO A COAT THAT MY GRANDFATHER ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE  WHO CAME TO CHICAGO IN 1917 FROM THE RUSSIAN ROMANIAN BORDER. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HAY, HAY, BUD -- HEY, HEY, BUDDY I ONCE FORGOT MY BOOKBAG IN THE OLIVE GARDEN. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME THE MAYOR OF ITALY. I'M BEING TOLD ITALY DOESN'T HAVE A MAYOR AND I DON'T HAVE A BOOKBAG. [LAUGHTER] UNLIMITED PASTA, SALAD AND PAIR GORGONZOLA RAV DEVELOPY. YOU CAN EAT FOR $68 CENTS. GET THE (bleep) OUT OF HERE. THAT IS FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE. [LAUGHTER] I WONDER HOW RAHM TOOK THE NEWS.
ANYTHING IN THE NEWS YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WOW. THE ONLY THING SCARIER THAN RAHM EMANUEL ANGRY IS RAHM EMANUEL SMILING THROUGH HIS ANGER. IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT TOOK THE NEWS IN THE PRIVACY OF HIS OWN HOME. [LAUGHTER] PUT A SHIRT ON! FOR MORE ON THE COURT RULING AND HIS MAYORAL BID WE GO TO JOHN OLIVER LIVE IN CHICAGO. JOHN, THANKS --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:  ARE THESE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS TO BYZANTINE AND STRICT?
NOT AT ALL, JON. THIS IS CHICAGO. POLITICIANS ARE STICKLERS, PARAGONS OF VIRTUE DEMANDING STRICT ADHERENCE TO A CODE OF CONDUCT.
Jon: I THINK THINK CHICAGO AND ILLINOIS POLITICS IN GENERAL IS CONSIDERED THE DIRTIEST IN  THE NATION.
WHOA WHOA, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW, SIR, THAT LESS THAN 60% OF  THEIR LAST SEVEN GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF FELONY. LESS THAN 60%, JON!
Jon: THAT'S ACTUALLY FOUR OF THE LAST SEVEN THAT'S MORE THAN HALF.
THAT'S BASICALLY|ï¿½t( WHAT I JUST SAID UNDER 60%. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ROD BLAGOJEVICH, SOME PEOPLE THINK JOHN F. KENNEDY ONLY ONE ILLINOIS AND THE  PRESIDENCY IN 1960 BECAUSE OF VOTES CAST BY PEOPLE IN CHICAGO WHO WERE DECEASED.
HERE WE GO, JON, DEAD CHICAGOANS FRAUDLY ELECTED KENNEDY. LET ME ASK YOU THIS, WHAT ABOUT THE ALL THE FRAUD CHICAGOANS WHO HELPED LYNDON JOHNSON PASS THE  CIVIL RIGHTS OF ACT OF 1964.
Jon: WHAT HAPPENED TO|ï¿½ï¿½i YOUR COAT?
WHAT.
Jon: I THINK SOMEONE STOLE YOUR COAT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, JON, I'M SURE THEY'LL BRING IT BACK. EVERYONE HERES WORKS ON AN HORROR CODE.
Jon: I ADMIRE YOUR FAITH IN THE GOODNESS OF PEOPLE BUT CHICAGO MAY NOT BE THE PLACE TO  BE EXERCISING THAT FAITH IN PEOPLE.
OKAY. I DISAGREE, JON. THAT IS SAY SIMPLIFICATION OF A --
Jon: WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SHIRT?
YEAH, JON U I GOT -- I GOT ATTACKED. I'M NOW ESSENTIALLY THE PROPERTY OF THE INSANE SPANISH COBRAS. NORTH SIDE, JON! NORTH SIDE!
Jon: COME HOME.
I LOVE IT HERE. THE PEOPLE ARE SO WARM EVEN THOUGH THE CITY HERE IS SO VERY, VERY COLD! MORNING
