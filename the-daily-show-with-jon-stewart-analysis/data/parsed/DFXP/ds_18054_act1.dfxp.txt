READY TO GO. READY TO GO. READY TO GO. READY TO GO. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  HEADQUARTERS THIS IS "THE DAILY  SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW" MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD ONE TONIGHT JASON BAITMAN. -- BATEMAN. FINE ACTOR, FUNNY MAN. WE BEGIN IN CONGRESS WHERE THE  SENATE WANTED TO GET A QUICK  DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION. QUIT LOOKING AT THE PHILOSOPHY  OF NOT ENACTING ANY GUN  REGULATIONS. IF YOU LOOK AT WHY OUR FOUNDING  FATHERS PUT IT THERE, THEY LIVED  UNDER THE TYRANNY OF KING GEORGE AND THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE  FREE PEOPLE IN THIS NEW COUNTRY  WOULD NEVER BE SUBJUGATED AGAIN AND NEVER HAVE TO LIVE UNDER  TYRANNY.
Jon: OR DEMOCRATIC  DECISIONS THEY DON'T AGREE WITH,  YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT THE GUNS ARE FOR. SO THE IDEA IS GUNS ARE A  BULLWORTH AGAINST DICTATORSHIP. WHY ELSE DO WE NEED GUNS?
WHAT PEOPLE ALL OVER THE  COUNTRY FEAR TODAY IS BEING  ABANDONED BY THEIR GOVERNMENT.
Jon: THE WAIT, WHAT? THE -- I'M LOST.
YOU COULD FIND YOURSELF IN  THIS COUNTRY IN A LAWLESS  ENVIRONMENT THROUGH A NATURAL DISASTER OR RIOT. MA RAWING GANGS GOING THROUGHOUT  THE AREA LOOTING STORES,  LOOTING, ROBBING AND RAPING.
Jon: IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES  LINDSEY GRAHAM DELIVERS A PRETTY  GOOD TENNESSEE WILLIAMS -- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THERE ARE  MAURADERES OUT THERE AND ME HERE  ON A STAIRCASE IN ONLY A NEGLIG, WE JUST MY PARASOL AND JULEP TO  PROTECT ME. LOOTING ROBBING AND RAPING. THEY MAY BE A GANG BUT YOU HAVE  TO ADMIRE THEIR AMBITION. THAT'S A MAURADING GANG GOING  PLACES. [ LAUGHTER ] WE NEED GUNS TO PROTECT US ON A  GOVERNMENT ON THE VERGE OF  FASCISM AND IMPOTENCE. HASN'T GONE EITHER WAY, BUT IT  COULD. NO ONE HAS SUGGESTED DISARMING  THE POCKET. THAT'S THE POINT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RESTRICTING  CERTAIN MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS  AS WE DO WITH TANKS, BUSINESSES AND I DON'T KNOW NAPALM. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT?
I'M HOLDING IN A HAND A  PISTOL GRIP. UNDER THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION  IF THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC, THIS  PISTOL GRIP WERE ATTACHED TO THIS RIFLE, IT WOULD SUDDENLY  BECOME A BANNED ASSAULT WEAPON.
Jon: ACTUALLY IT'S SUPPOSE  TBED A PICTURE OF AN ASSAULT  WEAPON WHICH EVEN UNDER OBAMA'S REIN WOULD STILL BE LEGAL. FAIR POINT THERE ARE ARBITRARY  ASPECTS AND SILLY ASPECTS TO THE  LEGISLATION THAT PERHAPS A YOUNG FACED FRESH LEGISLATOR CLEARLY  EAGER TO SHAPE LEGISLATION COULD  SHAPE. MAYBE DON'T MAKE IT ABOUT THE  GRIP BUT FIRE RATE MAGAZINE  SIZE.
WE HEAR THAT NOBODY NEEDS  LARGER MAGAZINES THAT THOSES  THAT USE TO SHOOT DEERS BUT AN ATTACKING CRIMINAL UNLIKE A DEER  SHOOTS BACK.
Jon: UNLIKE A DEER, SOMEONE  HASN'T SEEN BAMBO. LYME IS THE DISEASE, BAMBO IS  THE CURE! HE REALLY LOOKS A LOT LIKE A  KANGAROO RIGHT THERE. THAT'S -- LIKE A KANGAROO  IMITATING CLEOPATRA. THIS GUN CONTROL DISCUSSION IS  OFF TO A STANDARD AND REDUNDANT  START. ARE THERE ANY NEW ARGUMENTS THAT  CAN PUSH THE ASSAULT WEAPON BAN  FORWARD.
YOUNG WOMEN ARE SPEAK OUT AS  TO WHY THE AR-15 WEAPONS ARE THE  WEAPON OF CHOICE.
Jon: WORST J-DATE PROFILE  ENTRY EVER. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S GUN ACTIVITY GAIL PRADO. SHE HAS A STORY TO TELL WHY  LADIES NEED AR-15S.
I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH  THE COMPELLING STORY OF SARAH  McKINLEY. HOME ALONE WITH HER BABY SHE  CALLED 911 WHEN TWO VIOLENT  INTRUDERS BEGAN TO BREAK DOWN HER FRONT DOOR. MS. McKINLEY FIRED HER WEAPON  FATALLY WOUNDING ONE OF THE  VIOLENT ATTACKERS. THE OTHER FLED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: POWERFUL. ANECDOTAL BUT POWERFUL DOESN'T  GO TO THE FACT THAT YOU ARE  ACCORDING TO MOST STUDIES FOR MORE LIKELY TO BE HURT BY A GUN  IN THE HOME THAN USE IT TO  PROTECT FROM AN ASSAILANT.
QUICK QUESTION, SHE USED A  REMINGTON 870-EXPRESS 12-GAIG  SHOTGUN THAT WOULD NOT BE BANNED UNDER THE PROPOSED STATUTE,  CORRECT?
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT TYPE OF  WEAPON SHE USED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU DON'T REMEMBER. YOU TOLD A JAMES JOYCEIAN STORY  ABOUT THE LADY AND THE ROBBERS. YOU DON'T REMEMBER THE GUN, IE,  THE ONLY DETAIL RELEVANT TO THE  HEARING. IT WAS A NONBANNED WEAPON, A  SHOTGUN. WHY DO YOU NEED AN AR-15.
THE PEACE OF MIND THAT A  WOMAN HAS AS SHE'S FACING THREE,  FOUR, FIVE VIOLENT ATTACKERS, INTRUDERS IN HER HOME, WITH HER  CHILDREN SCREAMING IN THE  BACKGROUND, THE PEACE OF MIND KNOWING SHE HAS A SCARY LOOKING  GUN GIVES HER MORE COURAGE WHEN  SHE'S FIGHTING HARDENED VIOLENT  CRIMINALS.
Jon: WHEN DID IT TURN INTO  THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE. JEEZ, WHERE DID SHE LIVE THE  ALAMO? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? LET'S MOVE TO THE NRA PROPOSAL. WE'LL MOVE TO SOMETHING MORE  MAINSTREAM. UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SOME  BACKGROUND CHECKS. IT'S HOW ENCOMPASSING DO YOU DO  IT? DO YOU DO IT TO A FATHER SELLING  TO A SON, OR ANOTHER RELATIVE. HOW DO YOU COVER EVERYTHING? I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE. AND ALSO THE EXTENT OF WHICH YOU  HAVE PRIVATE SALES ON SUNDAY  BETWEEN RELATIVES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I'M NOT GOING TO PASS  JUDGMENTEN -- JUDGMENT ON A  CULTURE WHICH IS FOREIGN TO ME BUT IS THAT REALLY HOW IT WORKS,  SUNDAY IS FAMILY GUN SWAP DAY? IS THAT HOW IT GOES? I HAVE TO GET OUT MORE. ANYONE ELSE HAVE A REASON.
WHEN IT COMES TO BACKGROUND  CHECKS, LET'S BE HONEST. THEY'LL NEVER BE UNIVERSAL  BECAUSE CRIMINALS WILL NEVER  SUBMIT TO THEM.
Jon: GOOD POINT LET'S PASS  LAWS THAT ONLY CRIMINALS WILL  IMMEDIATELY OBEY. LET'S DO THAT. WHAT IS THIS THOU SHALT NOT  KILL. MURDERERS WILL BYPASS THAT. THEY'LL FIND A WAY AROUND IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST HERE. I KNOW THE MAIN LOBBYIST FOR GUN  MANUFACTURERS HAS A UNIQUE  INSIGHT ON TO WHETHER BACKGROUND CHECKS WORK. LET'S ASK YOU, WHY DO YOU THINK?
BACKGROUND CHECKS WORK.
Jon: SAYS YOU! [ LAUGHTER ] BALTIMORE COUNTY POLICE CHIEF. BACK IT UP.
THEY STOP NEARLY TWO MILLION  PROHIBITED PURCHASES BETWEEN  1994 AND 2009. EXTENDING A BACKGROUND CHECK TO  ALL FIREARM PURCHASES COULD  EASILY BE IMPLEMENTED AND IT SHOULD BE WITHOUT DELAY.
Jon: YOU SAY THAT AND THEY  SAY IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. HUMOR ME, LET'S SAY FOR A MINUTE  BACKGROUND CHECKS WILL WORK, ANY  OTHER REASON NOT TO DO IT?
I JUST DON'T THINK  LAW-ABIDING PEOPLE WANT EVERY  GUN SALE IN THE COUNTRY UNDER THE THUMB OF THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT.
Jon: EXCEPT THAT LITERALLY  ALMOST ALL OF THEM DO. INCLUDING ALMOST ALL AMERICANS  LIVING WITH A MEMBER OF THE NRA. I KNOW A GENTLEMAN WHO MAKES A  WONDERFUL CASE FOR UNIVERSAL  BACKGROUND CHECKS.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS  REASONABLE AND WHAT IS NOT. WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO  PROVIDE MANDATORY INSTANT  CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR EVERY SALE AT EVERY GUN SHOW. NO LOOPHOLES ANYWHERE FOR  ANYONE.
Jon: WOW, BACKGROUND CHECKS  USED TO BE SUPPORTED BY 100% OF  WAYNE'S LA PIERRE. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE LAST  TIME HE
