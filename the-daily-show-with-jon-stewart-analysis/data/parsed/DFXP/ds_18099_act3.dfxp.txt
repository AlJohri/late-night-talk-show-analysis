( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT ACADEMY AWARD  NOMINATED ACTRESS. HER NEW FILM IS THE GREAT  GATSBY.
LOVE IS MADE ENTIRELY OF YOUR  OWN IMAGINATION.
NO. YOU WERE THERE ALL ALONG. IT'S AN IDEA, A DECISION. OF COURSE IF ANYTHING IS NOT TO  YOUR LIKING, I'LL CHANGE IT.
IT'S PERFECT. FROM YOUR PERFECT, IRRESISTIBLE  IMAGINATION.
Jon: KISS HER, YOU FOOL. PLEASE WELCOME CAREC MULLIGAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NICELY DONE.
THANKS. Jon: FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE  SUPPOSED TO TURN IN A BOOK  REPORT ON THE GATSBY, A BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF WHAT GOES ON WOULD  BE HELPFUL RIGHT NOW.
YEAH. SO GATSBY IS GREAT.
Jon: HE IS GREAT AND HE LIVES  IN A REALLY NICE HOUSE.
HE DOES. Jon: THIS IS DAUNTING TO TAKE  ON A PIECE OF SUCH CHERISHED  LITERATURE. IS IT NOT?
YEAH, IT ALWAYS IS. I'VE DONE ADAPTATIONS OF NOVELS  BEFORE.
Jon: IT HAD TO BE... WHAT I  LIKE ABOUT IT IS IT HAD TO BE  AUDACIOUS TO DO SOMETHING LIKE  THIS. AND BAZ IS PROBABLY THE KING OF  AUDACIOUSNESS. THAT'S A GREAT PERSON TO DO  THIS.
YEAH, YEAH. AMAZING. ACTUALLY HAVING SEEN HIS FILMS I  AN IDEA OF WHAT IT WOULD BE  LIKE. BUT I'VE SEEN IT ONCE. SPECTACULAR.
Jon: YOU'VE ONLY SEEN IT  ONCE.
YEAH. I CAN'T WATCH MYSELF.
Jon: REALLY? NO. I SAW IT ONCE...
Jon: I PUT MY MOVIES ON A  LOOP.
IT'S WEIRD. IT WAS PLAYING BACK STAGE.
Jon: JUST MY ONE SCENE FROM  HALF BAKE.
YOU'RE GREAT. Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. WHEN YOU'RE THERE, THE EFFECT  THAT HE CREATES ARE SO STUNNING. BUT I ALWAYS WONDER WHEN YOU'RE  THERE, DOES THE, YOU KNOW,  PATINA OF MODERN FILM OR DO PEOPLE HAVE CELL PHONES IN THEIR  POCKETS.
GOING OFF DURING THE SCENES? Jon: EXACTLY. DO YOU GET THE FEELING OF THIS  SORT OF 1920s WHEN YOU'RE IN  IT.
YOU DO BECAUSE IT'S SO HUGE. YOU KNOW, THERE ARE 400 PEOPLE  DRESSED AS WELL LIKE THEY'RE IN  THE 1920s. YOU DO WALK INTO THE MIDDLE OF  IT.
Jon: IS IT, WHEN THEY'RE  DOING THOSE SCENES WITH MUSIC  AND I'M ALWAYS CURIOUS ABOUT  THIS. IS THERE MUSIC OR NO?
YEAH. WELL NOT FOR THE TALKING BIT. WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE WIDE SHOTS  THERE'S MUSIC.
Reporter: WHEN YOU'RE DOING  THE TALKY-TALK.
THAT'S HOW I REFER TO IT. THE TALKY-TALKY.
Jon: I'M ALL RIGHT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. Jon: YOU'RE DOING THE  TALKY-TALK AND EVERYONE BEHIND  YOU FOR 20 TAKES JUST HAS TO DO  THIS.
YES. BUT THEY'RE AMAZING. THEY GET INTO IT. LIKE THEY GO CRAZY.
Jon: DO THEY GIVE THEM A  BEAT?
YES. Jon: THEN THEY HAVE TO KEEP  TO THAT BEAT OR DOES ANYBODY...
WELL, SOMETIMES YOU GET IN  THE FANCY FILMS YOU GET LIKE AN  EAR WIIG IN YOUR EAR. 20 PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE MUSIC  PLAYING INTEREST THEIR EARS.
Jon: AND DO PEOPLE FOLLOW  THEM?
I HAD THAT AND I FELL OVER A  FEW TIMES SO THEY PUT THE MUSIC  AWAY.
Jon: THAT COULD GIVE YOU THE  VERTIGO. AND THE '20s CLOTHES, NO  BARGAIN EITHER. THE LADIES, THE '20s' LADIES  DIDN'T DRESS FOR COMFORTNESS  AIRL.
NO, NO. Jon: IT WAS DIFFICULT. WHEN THEY DO THIS TYPE OF THING,  HOW METICULOUS ARE THEY TO THE  PERIOD OR IS IT A PERIOD INTERPRETED THROUGH...
NO, THEY WERE REALLY  PARTICULAR. CATHERINE MARTIN WHO DOES ALL OF  BAZ'S FILMS AND WHO IS HIS WIFE  DOES ALL THE SETS AND THE  CLOTHES. THEY'RE REALLY REALLY SPECIFIC.
Jon: BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE  CAPTURING IT WAS SUCH AN  INCREDIBLE TIME. YOU KNOW, ITION FUNNY BECAUSE IT  WAS SORT OF... IT'S SAID TO BE  THE TIME OF THE DREAM, THAT IT  DIED. IT WENT ALONG FOR ANOTHER EIGHT  YEARS. AND THEN KILLED IT AGAIN.
WHICH IS WHY THE FILM IS TO  RELEVANT.
Jon: BUT IT DOES, YOU KNOW,  WHEN YOU WATCH IT, DO YOU FEEL  THEME ATICALLY, DO YOU FEEL IT CONNECT TO A MODERN AUDIENCE IN  THAT MANNER?
YEAH. I THINK BAZ IS THE REASON THAT  NOW IS THE TIME TO BRING IT  BACK. HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT  OTHERWISE. I THINK YOU DO. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE WAY  THAT HE DOES, I MEAN, EVERYONE  IS TALKING ABOUT THE SOUND TRACK FOR THE MUSIC. JAY GLEE PRODUCED THE SOUND  TRACK.
Jon: I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH  HIS WORK.
HE'S SORT OF AN UP-AND-COMER. I NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS  THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO  DO WITH HIM. AMAZING AND AWED.
Jon: WE HANG. YOU GUYS ARE LIKE BUDDIES I  HERE.
Jon: MOSTLY DOWN AT THE CRIB. THROUGH THE CRIB STORE.
I'M ALSO INVITED TO THE CRIB. BUT I'M NOT AVAILABLE.
Jon: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S  GREAT MUSICALLY. YOU'RE IN THIS OTHER MOVIE. AND THE MUSIC... THIS IS THE  MOVIE WHERE THE MUSIC IS  PHENOMENAL. AND THE FELLOW THAT DOES ISAAC,  WHO PLAYS... YOU'RE SINGING. WHEN DOES THAT COME OUT?
THAT COMES OUT LATER IN THE  YEAR, I THINK, YEAH.
Jon: THIS YEAR. THIS YEAR, YEAH. Jon: IS THAT SOMETHING. WHERE ART THOU? SNOP I JUST LOVE THAT. YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD YEAR. ANYTHING [BLEEP] COMING OUT WITH  THAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT? NOTHING? JUST ALL ACES.
THAT'S NEXT YEAR. ITS GOING TO BE A DISASTER.
Jon: IT'S JUST GOING SO WELL,  I REALLY NEED TO BOMB IN  SOMETHING. WELL, THE GREAT GATSBY IS IN  THEATERS ON FRIDAY. LIKE THERE'S A THING ABOUT IT. I GUESS YOU CALL IT A GROUND  SWELL.
YEAH. Jon: ARE YOU SUPERSTITIOUS? I AM. Jon: I FEEL THAT RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT. CAREY MULLIGAN, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
