FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  HEY! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. IT'S A REALLY SPECIAL NIGHT TONIGHT, A REALLY SPECIAL NIGHT. THE GREAT CHRIS ROCK IS GOING TO BE JOINING US LATER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). BUT FIRST, BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, AS YOU KNOW, AS WE'VE DISCUSSED ON THIS PROGRAM ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, AMERICA, AMERICA, 'MERICA. WE'VE BEEN HAVING A BIT OF A BAD WEEK-- MONTH -- EPOCH. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT YOU KNOW WHO'S BEEN HAVING A PRETTY GOOD WEEK-- TOTALITARIAN REGIMES. TAKE, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE, NORTH KOREA. AS YOU KNOW, THEY OR SOME MERCENARY COMPUTER HACKERS, A NERD TEAM 6 IF YOU WILL, BROKE INTO COMPUTERS AT SONY PICTURES IN RETALIATION FOR THE UPCOMING MOVIE "THE INTERVIEW," WHILE APPARENTLY LEAVING SONY COMPLETELY ALONE FOR "AFTER EARTH." I MEAN, THAT MAKES NO SENSE. I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKE YOU HAVE THE MOST CHARISMATIC STAR IN THE WORLD IN WILL SMITH. HE'S STUCK IN A BUBBLE, CAN'T GO ANYWHERE. MEANWHILE, THE WHOLE MOVIE, SOME ( BLEEP ) KID IS FLYING AROUND IN A MAGIC SQUIRREL SUIT. I MEAN, THE WHOLE THING. AND THE BAD GUYS CAN ONLY SEE YOU IF THEY SMELL FEAR. GUESS WHAT? IT'S A VISUAL MEDIUM. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? OH, WELL, APPARENTLY, THE THREATENED EXPOSURE OF MORE CATTY E-MAILS DIDN'T SLOW SONY DOWN IN THEIR VILLAINOUS PLOT TO RELEASE A COMEDY. SO THE HACKERS WENT TO PLAN B.
THEY CLAIMED THEATERS THAT SHOW SONY'S NEW COMEDY "THE INTERVIEW" WILL FACE 9/11-STYLE ATTACKS.
Jon:  FIRST OF ALL, WHEN DID 9/11 BECOME A STYLE OF ATTACKS? ( LAUGHTER ) "WE HEARD YOU WERE INTERESTED IN ATTACKING SOMETHING. WE'VE ASSEMBLED A PINTREST PAGE. LITTLE INSPIRATION BOOK OF -- TELL US WHAT STYLE OF ATTACK YOU'D LIKE. MAYBE A 9/11, MAYBE A DRESDEN." BUT THE POINT IS, YOU'VE DONE   ( BLEEP ) UP NOW, BUDDY. YOU STEPPED IN IT. 9/11 IS OUR MAGIC STRENGTH. IT'S OUR SPINACH. IT REMINDS US, WE DON'T GIVE IN, WE NEVER GIVE UP, WE DON'T BACK DOWN.
THE SONY SPOKESPERSON SAYS THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE RELEASING THE FILM. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  OKAY. NOT RELEASING IT IN THEATERS, BECAUSE VIDEO ON DEMAND IS A DEMOCRATIZED TECHNOLOGY. IT WILL INHABIT THE ENTIRE EARTH. YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE, NORTH COHACKERS. CAUSE THESE COLORS DON'T RUN.
NO VIDEO ON DEMAND. IT'S AS IF "THE INTERVIEW" NEVER EXISTED.
Jon:  ( BLEEP ) YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S IT? SO KIM JONG UN GETS TO DECIDE WHAT MOVIES WE MAKE? SO THIS IS EVERY MOVIE FROM NOW ON IS JUST THIS, "WORLD'S BIGGEST PENIS, THE MOTION PICTURE." THAT'S IT. ACTUALLY, HERE'S WHAT'S INTERESTING. IN KOREAN, THAT TRANSLATES TO AFTER-GIRTH. ( LAUGHTER ) FOR GOD'S SAKE, NORTH KOREA, THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. THEY THREATEN PEOPLE WITH HYPERBOLIC LANGUAGE. WHY DO WE FALL FOR THAT? THAT'S THEIR HOOK.
NORTH KOREA HAS THREATENED TO TURN WASHINGTON INTO A SEA OF FIRE.
Jon:  SEA OF FIRE! WHAT? AND DID WASHINGTON SHUT DOWN? DID OUR GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN? OKAY, YES, IT DID SHUT DOWN, BUT THAT WASN'T WHY. IT WAS A FUNDING DISPUTE. BAD EXAMPLE. THE POINT IS THIS-- KIM JONG UN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'RE SO MAD AT HOLLYWOOD. YOU SHOULD LOVE THEM. HOLLYWOOD IS JUST LIKE NORTH KOREA. EVERYONE IS ALWAYS TELLING YOU HOW GREAT YOU ARE. THERE ARE BILLBOARDS EVERYWHERE WITH YOUR FACE ON THEM AND NO ONE EATS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT MEANWHILE, CLOSER TO HOME, SOME OF OUR OTHER ENEMIES GOT GOOD NEWS AS WELL.
PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCING PLANS TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST CUBA AFTER MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY.
WE WILL END AN OUTDATED APPROACH THAT FOR DECADES HAS FAILED TO ADVANCE OUR INTERESTS.
Jon:  SPECIFICALLY OUR INTEREST IN BREATHABLE SHIRTS, DELICIOUS CIGARS AND ADORABLE OLD MEN BANDS. COME ON, HOW BAD COULD CUBA BE? THEY'RE LIKE HUMMEL FIGURES THAT PLAY GUITAR. BUT LIKE ANY CHANGE, THERE WILL BE SOME LAGGARDS.
RIGHT WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION WAS FEELING THE MAXIMUM PAIN, IT THROWS THEM AN ECONOMIC LIVES LINE AND CONTINUES THE BRUTAL REPRESSION AND DICTATORSHIP OF THE CASTRO BROTHERS.
THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT UNFORTUNATELY IS GOING TO MANIPULATE ALL THESE CHANGES TO TIGHTEN THEIR GRIP ON POWER.
Jon:  TIGHTEN THEIR GRIP ON POWER? THESE TWO ARE BARELY HOLDING ON TO LIFE. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKE, JUNIOR IS 83. AT THIS POINT, HIS BIG BROTHER, SO TO SPEAK, HE JUST LIES IN A CORNER FARTING DUST. IT DOESN'T-- WE'VE EMBARGOED THEM FOR OVER 50 YEARS. IT HASN'T SHAKEN THEIR POWER. MEANWHILE, WE'VE THROWN PLENTY OF DICTATOR BRUNCHES THAT THESE TWO WOULD SURELY QUALIFY FOR. SO WHY NOT SEE IF LIBERALIZING BORDERS CAN HELP CHANGE THE DYNAMIC.
WE AS A NATION AND OUR MORAL STANDING IN THE WORLD IS BASED ON ONE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE AND THAT IS A RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY, HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM.
EVERY ECONOMIC TRANSACTION STRENGTHENS THE REGIME THAT IS OPPRESSING, THAT IS TORTURING.
Jon:  I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU TWO GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, BUT I THINK I KNOW WHICH BOOK I'M GETTING YOU FOR THE HOLIDAYS. ( LAUGHTER )
JON, JON, MR. STEWART, AMERICA MAKES BIG MISTAKE.
Jon:  WHAT? IS THAT-- WHAT THE-- OH, MY GOD, EVERYBODY! IT'S GITMO, THE GUANTANAMO DETAINEE. WHAT'S GOING ON, OLD PAL?
GITMO MUST WARN AMERICA BY DOING BUSINESS WITH OPPRESSIVE CUBA REGIME, AMERICA DESTROY ITS MORAL STANDING.
Jon:  WHAT-- WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?
TRUST GITMO. GITMO IN CUBAN PRISON RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) AWFUL CONDITIONS. GITMO ON HUNGER STRIKE, BUT NOTHING CHANGED. OH SORRY! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  SO SAD. IT'S SO SAD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( BLEEP ) GITMO. GITMO, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, GUATANAMO BAY, THAT'S ACTUALLY, THAT'S IN CUBA, BUT THAT'S AN AMERICAN PRISON. THAT'S OUR GOVERNMENT HOLDING YOU IN THOSE CONDITIONS. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
OH, RIGHT. BRAIN GET CLOUDY AFTER 10 YEARS, WHAT WAS GITMO CHARGED WITH AGAIN?
Jon:  CHARGED WITH? UM... IT'S A FUNNY STORY. WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOTTEN AROUND TO-- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, GITMO-- ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHAT, GITMO? IT COULD BE WORSE. SOME OF-- IT'S HARDER THAN IT LOOKS. SOME OF OUR OTHER OFFSHORE DETAINEES GOT FOOD TUBES IN THEIR RECTUMS.
GITMO DREAM OF FOOD TUBE IN RECTUM. ( LAUGHTER ) HAS TO BE BETTER THAN MAN'S ARM.
Jon:  WELL, THAT-- THAT'S TRUE, THAT CAN'T BE COMFORTABLE, BUT SURELY, YOU MUST TAKE SOLACE IN SENATOR RUBIO'S AND CRUZ'S DISCUSSION OF AMERICAN VALUES.
SURE. AS LONG AS THE MORAL RELATIVISM OF THEIR POSITION IS SINCERE AND NOT A PANDER TO A POWERFUL, CUBAN EXPAT COMMUNITY IN AND ATTEMPT TO GAIN AN EDGE ON FLORIDA'S 29 SWING STATE ELECTORAL VOTE.
Jon:  GOD, GITMO. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? THAT IS SO CYNICAL.
GITMO SORRY. GITMO SHOULD HAVE MORE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  THANK YOU, GITMO. I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY. GITMO, EVERYBODY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. HOW DARE YOU?
