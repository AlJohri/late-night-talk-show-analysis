FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU THIS EVENING. MY GUEST TONIGHT COLUMNIST CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER IS JOINING US. BUT FIRST 50 YEARS AGO IN DALLAS AN ASSASSINATION THAT CHANGED -- SORRY I THOUGHT WE WERE HAVING A DISCUSSION EARLIER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] EARLIER TONIGHT WE WERE HAVING A SPIRITED AND INTERESTING DISCUSSION. I THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A WITTY JOKE ABOUT IT. WE BEGIN ON WALL STREET. IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE THE FINANCIAL COLLAPSE THAT TANKED THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. WHILE NO ONE HAS BEEN SENT TO JAIL OR COMMUNITY SERVICE OR EVEN HAD A ONE HOUR TIME OUT IN A ROOM OR FACED THE REALITY OF CAUSING A SELF INFLICTED ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE. MAYBE IT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE.
JP MORGAN AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAVE TENTATIVELY AGREED TO A 13 BILLION CIVEL SETTLEMENT.
$13 BILLION SETTLEMENT WITH
$1THE GOVERNMENT TO ENDWITH INVESTIGATIONS INTO BAD LOANS.
THEY SAY JP MORGAN KNOWINGLY >>MISLED INVESTORS BY SELLINGLY SECURITIES THAT WERE BACKED BY RISKY MORTGAGES.
Jon: RISKY MORTGAGES. IT SEEMS SO MUCH COOLER WHEN TOM CRUISE WAS IN THAT MOVIE. HIS PARENTS WERE OUT OF TOWN AND HIM AND HIS FRIENDS CONVINCED PEOPLE TO TAKE ON IMPROPERLY COLLATERALIZED LOANS AND THEN PACKAGED THE LOANS WITH A SULTRY DERIVATIVES TRADER. I REMEMBER HER. AND THAT GUY WHO WENT ON TO PLAY BOOGER. THAT'S WHY SO MANY TRADERS WORK IN A BUTTON DOWN AND UNDERPANTS. $13 BILLION WHAT LUCKY BASTARDS ARE GETTING A BITE OF THAT CHEESE. $6 BILLION GOES TOWARDS INVESTOR COMPENSATION $4 BILLION FOR HOMEOWNER RELIEF AND $2 BILLION IN PENALTY FINES BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO PAY JP MORGAN'S $8 SETTLEMENT PROCESSING FEES. DAMN YOU BANK FEES. DAMN YOU AND YOUR BANK! YOU KNOW WHO MUST BE THRILLED TO YOUHEAR THIS NEWS? FINANCIALD TO ANALYSTS AND BUSINESS REPORTERS WHO AFTER YEARS OF COVERING CORPORATE MISDEEDS ARE SEEING JUSTICE SERVED.
WHAT IS UP WITH THIS INCREDIBLE $13 BILLION SHAKE DOWN OF JP MORGAN.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FEELS LIKE IT NEEDS SCALPS. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS AT WAR.
IS IT A WITCH HUNT.
IT'S A JIHAD AGAINST JP MORGAN.
Jon: IT'S A SHAKE DOWN, WITCHHUNT SCALPING JIHAD. SO WAIT, WHAT I SAW IS A MUTUALLY NEGOTIATED COMPENSATORY AGREEMENT RELATED TO SHAKY BUSINESS DEALINGS YOU SEE IT AS A SHAKEDOWN WITCHHUNT SCALPING JIHAD. IT'S LIKE IF THE HOLOCAUST HAD SEX WITH SLAVERY WHILE THE LAST TEN SECONDS OF HUMAN CENTIPEDE WATCHED. I'LL BITE. WHAT IS THE GREAT INJUSTICE DONE TO JP MORGAN CHASE HERE?
80% OF THE MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES THEY ARE PUNISHED FOR WERE ACQUIRED WHEN THEY GOT BEAR STERNS -- TO SOME DEGREE IT SEEMS WRONG THAT JP MORGAN HAS TO PAY FOR WHAT HAPPENED.
WHAT JURY IS GOING TO HOLD JP MORGAN CHASE LIABLE FOR THE DOCUMENTS THAT  BEAR STERNS SOLD TO PEOPLE
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING WHY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DOCUMENTS OF OF A COMPANY THAT THEY BOUGHT? BUT I GUESS BECAUSE THEY BOUGHT THE COMPANY. BUT IF THIS IS NEW WAY YOU WANT TO RUN IT NOW. I OWE JP MORGAN CHASE $500,000 ON MY MORTGAGE AND I DECIDED (bleep) THIS PLACE. I'M GOING TO SELL IT FOR 50,000 AND WALK AWAY WITH THE MONEY. UNDER THIS NEW SYSTEM THE GUY WHO BUYS IT DOESN'T OWE YOU GUYS (bleep). PROBLEMS YOU CAUSE DON'T DISAPPEAR BECAUSE SOMEONE BUYS YOU. THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRICE. YOU KNOW WHO KNEW THAT? JAMIE DIMON FROM JP MORGAN CHASE. HE TOLD INVESTORS ANY LIABILITY RELATED TO THE ASSETS WILL COME WITH US. HE BRACED HIS COMPANY FOR BY SETTING ASIDE A 28 BILLION RAINY DAY SETTLEMENT FUND AND GUESS WHAT? IT'S RAINING (bleep). LOOKS TO ME LIKE THIS GOVERNMENT SETTLEMENT IS $15 BILLION LESS THAN WHAT DIMON THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE. THE ONLY WAY THIS SETTLEMENT COULD GET SWEETER IS IT IF IT WAS TAX DEDUCTIBLE.
IT COULD BE DOWN TO $9 BILLION.
BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF DEAL IS EXPECTED TO BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.
SON OF A BITCH. THIS CONFIRMS WHAT I SAID SETTLEMENTS FOR CORPORATE FRAUD AND MALFEASANCE AND DONATIONS TO BREAST CANCER CHARITIES ARE EQUAL IN THE EYES OF THE LAW. THE PASSION AND DRIVE FROM SO MANY CNBC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSTS GOES SOLELY IN ONE DIRECTION AND NOT IN THE DIRECTION YOU NORMALLY ASSOCIATE WITH JOURNALISM. HERE IS MARIA REACTING TO ALEX PAREENE'S INCREDIBLE HUBRIS
I THINK ANY TIME YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE GREATEST FINE IN THE HISTORY OF WALL STREET REGULATION IT'S WORTH ASKING SHOULD THIS GUY STAY IN HIS JOB.
THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO CHURN OUT TENS OF BILLIONS IN EARNING AND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS IN REVENUE, HOW DO YOU CRITICIZE THAT?
Jon: BECAUSE PROFIT IS THE ONLY WAY WE JUDGE THINGS. ONLY AT CNBC IS BREAKING BAD THE STORY HOW ONE MAN THROUGH HARD STORWORK AND SMART BUSINESSARD PRACTICES SLOWLY INSULATES HIMSELF FROM CRITICISM WATCH AS THE INTREPID YOUNG PAREENE SUGGESTS THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS OF LOOKING AT MORGAN CHASE.
A LOT OF EARNINGS AND REVENUE WE'VE SEEN HAVE COME FROM SHADY DEALINGS.
COME ON.
IT'S A FACT. IT'S IN THE NEWS.
WHAT IS THE FACT?
THEY HIRED OF CHILDREN OF PROMINENT PARTY OFFICIALS AND THERE'S A SPREAD SHEET WHICH CONNECTED TO DEALS THEY WERE TRYING TO DO IN CHINA.
I DON'T LIKE HEARING THINGS THAT ARE NOT FACTS ON THIS PROGRAM.
ANYBODY CAN GOOGLE CHINA AND JP MORGAN. IT WAS IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES".
OH, "THE NEW YORK TIMES", OH, OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OH, "THE NEW YORK TIMES", THE PAPER OF RECORD FOR CRACKHEADS AND LIARS. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY FINANCIAL JOURNALISTS SEEM TO FEEL THAT THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTING IS BENEATH THEIR VERACITY STANDARDS. IS THERE A NEW SOURCE THAT IS FACT-FILLED AND TRUSTWORTHY ENOUGH TO QUOTE ON YOUR HALLOWED CNBC AIR.
MANDATORY READING THE EDITORIAL IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE EDITORIAL IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.
SHAKEDOWN SAYS "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL".
IF YOU YOU HAVE TO WORK AT THE EDITORIAL BOARD YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE AT THE "NEW YORK TIMES".
THE ONLY PLACE THE FINANCIAL GUYS CONSIDER FACTUAL ENOUGH FOR REBROADCAST IS THE ONE PART OF THE RUPERT MURDOCH BIAS MACHINE EXPLICITLY LABELED OPINION. THERE MAY BE ONE MITIGATING FACTOR IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES MORGAN FOUND THEMSELVES IN WHEN TAKING ON THE LIABILITIES OF WASHINGTON MUTUAL AND BEAR STERNS.
THE GOVERNMENT ASKED JP MORGAN BUY UP BEAR STERNS AND BUY WASHINGTON MUTUAL.
THEY CAME TO JPM HAT IN HAND IN ORDER TO SAVE THEM FROM COLLAPSE.
THEY BEGGED HIM TO DO IT. HE COULD HAVE WALKED AWAY.
WAMU AND BEAR STERNS.
THE GOVERNMENT DID PUT A GUN TO THEIR HEAD. THEY WERE VIGOROUSLY ENCOURAGED TO TAKE OVER BEAR STERNS.
Jon: OH, I DID NOT REALIZE THAT. I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE GOVERNMENT PUT A GUN TO HIS HEAD, FORCED HIM INTO A BAD DEAL. NOW I GET YOUR OUTRAGE. I'M SORRY. IF ONLY THERE WAS A WAY TO GO BACK IN TIME TO WHEN THAT DEAL WAS CONSUMATED IN 2008 AND SEE HOW OUTRAGED CNBC WAS FOR JP MORGAN AT THAT TIME AS THE GOVERNMENT FORCED DIMON TO SWALLOW THIS (bleep) SANDWICH. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WONDER IF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO COULD GIVE US A SENSE OF THAT DEAL WAS AN OLD FRIEND WHO DOESN'T SEEM TO REALIZE HIS SHOWS ARE TAPED AND BROADCAST. SO MUCH THE BETTER. THERE'S NO WORD IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THAT CAPTURES THE THE RUTHLESS BRILLIANCE OF WHAT JAMIE DIMON, THE CEO OF JP MORGAN ACCOMPLISHED THIS WEEKEND.
Jon: GO ON.
DIMON MASTERMINDED A DEAL THAT IS AMAZING FOR JP MORGAN AND MAKES ME WANT TO SAY BUY BUY BUY. HE TOTALLY OUTFOXED THE FED. THERE'S NO DENYING IT WAS A STEAL. MAYBE A SHAKEDOWN IF THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT WOULD LET ME. IT'SL PRACTICALLY CRIMINAL, AND  I MEAN IT AS A POSITIVE. IT'S THE HENRY POTTER PRIZE FOR MERCILESS TAKE NO PRISONERS BUT LOTS OF PROFITS BANKING. [LAUGHTER] [BLEEP] ALL Y'ALL
