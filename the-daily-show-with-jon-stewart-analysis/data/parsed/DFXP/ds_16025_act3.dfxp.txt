Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A REPORTER WHOSE NEW SHOW WITH OPRAH WINFREY NETWORK IS CALLED OUR  AMERICA WITH LISA LING.
I CAN'T SEE A SINGLE HINT OF THE WOMAN HE USED TO BE AND NEITHER CAN THE TWO MEN  WORKING OUT NEARBY.
JUST WALK IN THE DOOR. I AM ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY. I'M A DOCTOR. I WISHED I COULD HAVE A BOTTLE LIKE THAT. LOOK AT THE SHOULDERS ON THIS DUDE. THE TRY ACCEPTS AND BUY ACCEPTS, WELL DEFINED. GOOD ABS. THEY LOOK MORE AMAZING THAN THE CALVES.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW LISA LING. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELCOME.
THANK YOU.
Jon: WELCOME BACK.
I WOULD HAVE EMBRACED YOU, BUT I KNOW YOU'RE HILL.
Jon: THE KIDS, I SWEAR TO YOU.
THEY GAVE IT TO YOU.
Jon: THEY SPREAD MUCOUS AROUND THE HOUSE LIKE IT'S PUDDING.
SO NICE OF YOU TO COME TO WORK AND INFECT EVERYONE ELSE ON YOUR STAFF. SO KIND OF YOU.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I TELL 'EM. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I'M GREAT.
Jon: YOU HAVE JUST WITNESSED "OUR AMERICA." WHAT ARE THE ASPECTS OF "OUR  AMERICA "THAT YOU SOUGHT TO UNCOVER TO FURTHER EXPLORE?
WELL THE PURPOSE OF THE SERIES IS TO BE SORT OF A WINDOW INTO DIFFERENT ASPECTS  OF AMERICA. WE COVER SOME TOPICS THAT COULD BE CONTROVERSIAL. I MEAN THIS SHOW THAT IS AIRING TONIGHT IS CALLED TRANSGENDERED LIFES. YOU JUST SAW A PERSON BORN AS A WOMAN AND NEVER IDENTIFIED WITH BEING A WOMAN. HE'S BEEN UNDERGOING HORMONE TREATMENTS AND SO ON. AS YOU CAN SEE MADE SOME PRETTY TREMENDOUS PROGRESS.
Jon: WHAT HORMONES WOULD GIVE YOU THAT IF YOU WERE WORKING OUT? LIKE WHAT WOULD....
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU. BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY WORKING FOR HIM. IT'S A REALLY BEAUTIFUL SHOW. WE COVER PEOPLE AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF TRANSITION. INCLUDING A SIX-YEAR-OLD CHILD WHO WAS BORN HARRY BUT NEVER IDENTIFIED AS A BOY.
Jon: AT WHAT AGE DO THEY SAY SOMEONE WOULD FIND THEIR GENDER IDENTITY? COULD IT BE AT 6 OR EVEN EARLIER THAN THAT?
WELL, HARRY WHO NOW GOES BY HALEY, HE CHANGED HIS CHANGE. BUT HER PARENTS AND THEY'RE RAISING HER AS A GIRL BECAUSE SHE REFUSES TO BE CALLED A BOY  OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THEY SAID AS SOON AS....
Jon: WERE THEY PREPARED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS?
NO ONE CAN EVER PREPARE, I DON'T THINK. IN FACT, WE REACHED OUT TO HUNDREDS OF PARENTS. NOBODY WANTED TO BE ON CAMERA EXCEPT FOR THIS COUPLE. THEY SAID THAT THEY LIVE IN THIS REALLY SAFE COMMUNITY. IF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SAFE COMMUNITIES DON'T SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT  IN SAFE COMMUNITIES, THEN THESE KIDS COULD END... BE DESTINED FOR LIVES OF TORTURE. IT'S REALLY... I MEAN IT RAISES A QUESTION, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOUR CHILD NEVER  IDENTIFIED WITH THE GENDER HE OR SHE WAS BORN. WOULD YOU ALLOW... WOULD YOU RAISE YOUR CHILD AS A DIFFERENT GENDER? HALEY'S FATHER IS A FAIRLY RELIGIOUS MAN, CONSERVATIVE. HE SAID THAT IT REALLY STRUCK AT EVERYTHING THAT HE OR CHANGED EVERYTHING HE LEARNED. HE IS A CHURCH-GOING MAN. KIND OF GREW UP FEELING LIKE GAY PEOPLE, TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE, THERE'S SOMETHING  WRONG WITH THEM. THEY'RE SINFUL UNTIL IT HAPPENED TO HIM. HE JUST HAS BECOME SO LOVING AND INDECREEDIBLE. I REALLY ADMIRE THESE PARENTS.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY. WHAT'S YOUR NEXT STORY? AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED YOUR SHOW IS DONE. WHAT'S NEXT AFTER THAT? WHAT'S THE NEXT ONE?
THE NEXT EPISODE WE VISIT A COLONY IN CENTRAL FLORIDA OR IN THE WOODS OF FLORIDA THAT  CONSISTS OF SEX OFFENDERS.
Jon: THIS DOESN'T SEEM AS WARM AND FUZZY.
IT'S NOT AS WARM AND FUZZY.
Jon: THE OTHER ONE FELT LIKE MY HEART WAS OPENING UP. AND I THOUGHT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE ACCEPTANCE THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS FOR THEM.
THERE'S NONE. THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE OVER 700,000 REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS.
Jon: IN THIS ONE TOWN?
NO, NO.
Jon: HOLY (BEEP). I THINK THAT MIGHT BE TAMPA. YOU'RE KIDDING. A JOKE, A JOKE.
YOU'RE NOT FAR FROM TAMPA BUT I WON'T BE TOO SPECIFIC.
Jon: HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN THIS COLONY?
IN THE ONE WE VISITED ABOUT 30 BUT THERE ARE ALLEGEDLY HUNDREDS WHO LIVE IN THE WOODS  OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA.
Jon: IS THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN DISTANCE AWAY FROM....
YEAH.
Jon: ARE THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRUE SEX OFFENDERS OR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LABELED  AS SUCH DUE TO....
NO, THESE ARE....
Jon: CERTAIN LEGALITIES.
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED TIME FOR....
Jon: OKAY.
IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA YOU HAVE TO LIVE BEYOND 1500 FEET OR 2500 FROM WHERE CHILDREN CONGREGATE. SO THEY'RE BEING PUSHED ESSENTIALLY INTO THE WOODS. WHAT THEY TOLD ME IS THAT IF A SEX OFFENDER REALLY WANTED TO OFFEND HE OR SHE WILL FIND A  WAY TO DO SO. DO THESE LAWS ACTUALLY MAKE US SAFER OR MAKE US FEEL SAFER?
Jon: I ALWAYS FELT LIKE THE NAME OFFENDER ALWAYS STRUCK ME AS SLIGHTLY LOWERING YOUR  EXPECTATION ABOUT WHAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS DO. LIKE IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE GET OFFENDED WHEN YOU GO LIKE (BEEP): THAT'S OFFENSIVE. THAT OFFENDED ME. WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS, WE SHOULD COME UP WITH A BETTER TERM LIKE....
YEAH.
Jon: (BEEP).
THEY CERTAINLY ARE OUR COUNTRIES PIRAHAS.
Jon: IT MAY BE THE HARDEST GROUP TO FIND EMPATHY FOR ME. FOR ME I FIND THAT A DIFFICULT GROUP TO... YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT  COMMIT RAPE OR DO THINGS TO CHILDREN. I HAVE DIFFICULTIES BEING LIKE, I'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM.
OUR INTENTION ISN'T TO TRY AND INSPIRE EMPATHY BY ANY MEANS. FOR SEX OFFENDERS. IT'S JUST TO ALLOY YOU TO UNDERSTAND THEIR... TO ALLOW YOU TO UNDERSTAND THEIR WORLD  A LITTLE BIT. IF WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE ON THE PERIPHERY WE CAN'T REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. IN A WAY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE FACT THAT THESE ARE ALSO  AMERICANS WHO COULD POSSIBLY LIVE NEXT DOOR TO YOU.
Jon: YOU ARE DOING WHAT A GOOD JOURNALIST DOES.
WE'RE TRYING TO.
Jon: AND I AM DOING WHAT PEOPLE WHO CANNOT BE IN YOUR BUSINESS DO. THAT'S VERY ADMIRABLE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT OBJECTIVE POINT OF VIEW AND  KEEP US INFORMED.
WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE EXPERIENCES THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF AMERICA.
Jon: COME BACK AND SEE US AGAIN AS THE SERIES KEEPS GOING BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO KEEP  UP WITH THAT TYPE OF STUFF.
I'D LOVE TO. THANK YOU.
Jon: VERY GOOD. "OUR AMERICA" WITH LISA LING AIRS TUESDAYS AT 10:00 ON OWN.
