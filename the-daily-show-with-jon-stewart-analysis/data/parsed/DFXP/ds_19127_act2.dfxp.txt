[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. ANOTHER BIG STORY FROM JUST AFTER WE WENT AWAY. WE ALL REMEMBER HOW PIPE CLEANER PARADISE HOBBY LOBBY WAS NOT KEEN ON THE OBAMACARE PROVISION REQUIRING FULL CONTRACEPTION COVERAGE IN EMPLOYEE HEALTH PLANS.  WHY DO THEY CARE? THAT GUY. LOVES CRAFTS. HATES PREMARITAL SEX. CASE WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT AND WE FINALLY GOT OUR ANSWER.
BIG A DAY AT THE SUPREME COURT IN THIS THE LAST DAY OF ITS TERM. THEY RULED THAT LIKE THE REST OF US, CORPORATIONS HAVE A RIGHT TO EXERCISE THEIR RELIGION.
OBAMACARE, HOBBY LOBBY CLAIMED, RESTRICTED THEIR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, BUT DOES A FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATION HAVE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY? YES, THE SUPREME COURT SAID TODAY IN A 5-4 DECISION.
Jon: YES, A RULING CAME DOWN IN THE CASE OF HOBBY LOBBY V. DIRTY, DIRTY CONTRACEPTION WHORES. FINAL SCORE HOBBY LOBBY 5, WHORES 4. SORRY, WHORES. ASIDE FROM CODIFYING THE SOMEWHAT ODD NOTION THAT CORPORATIONS CAN HAVE DEEPLY FELT RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, ONE THING STRUCK ME ABOUT THE DECISION. HOBBY LOBBY DIDN'T WANT ITS EMPLOYEES INSURANCE TO COVER CERTAIN CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS SUCH AS PLAN "B" BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT METHOD CAUSED ABORTIONS. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT IS...IS...IT'S NOT... WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR, TRUE. AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS, ALTHOUGH WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT VAGINAS? I DON'T THINK... NOT AS MUCH AS THE OWNERS OF A STORE THAT SELLS FOAM CONES AND GLITTER. LOOK, HERE'S THE JURISPRUDENCE BEAUTY PART. TO THE COURT, THE FACT THAT HOBBY LOBBY IS OBJECTING TO ABORTIONS THAT NEVER ACTUALLY HAPPEN DOESN'T MATTER. BECAUSE AS JUSTICE ALITO WROTE, IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT TO SAY THAT THE PLAINTIFF'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ARE MISTAKEN OR UNREASONABLE. FOR MORE WE GO TO JESSICA WILLIAMS AT THE SUPREME COURT. JESSICA, THANKS FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I HAVE READ THIS CASE. THIS SEEMS CRAZY TO ME.
OH, YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, RELAX, JON. IT'S A MUCH MORE NARROW RULING THAN IT SEEMS. YOU KNOW, HOBBY LOBBY WAS ONLY OBJECTING TO FOUR TYPES OF BIRTH CONTROL, SO THIS WILL HARDLY AFFECT ANYONE.
Jon: WOW.
UNLESS, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME RELIGION OUT THERE THAT'S OPPOSED TO ALL CONTRACEPTION.
Jon: OH LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, CATHOLICISM.
OH, RIGHT. I KNEW I FORGOT ONE.
Jon: YEAH.
BUT STILL, YOU KNOW, THE RULING ONLY APPLIES TO SMALL, CLOSELY HELD COMPANIES.
Jon: YEAH, YOU KNOW, WE'VE HEARD THAT TERM "CLOSELY HELD." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOU KNOW WHAT, JON, THINK OF IT AS A HUG,
Jon: OK, OK.
A HUG THAT SQUEEZES ALL THE SLUTS OFF THE HEALTH PLAN.
Jon: OH OKAY. BUT THEN THIS IS, THIS DECISION IS ONLY LIMITED TO SMALL PRIVATE BUSINESSES.
YEAH, ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW WHAT, TECHNICALLY NO BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE ACTUAL COURT DECISION TO STOP LARGE PUBLIC COMPANIES FROM TRYING TO CLAIM THE SAME EXEMPTIONS.
Jon: ALRIGHT. BUT JUSTICE ALITO DID SAY IT'S EASY FOR INSURERS TO PICK UP ANY COVERAGE THAT CORPORATIONS OPT OUT OF PROVIDING.
Jon: BUT, I SENSE AN ALTHOUGH COMING.
RIGHT. ALTHOUGH A FEW DAYS LATER IN THE WHEATON CASE, THE COURT ALSO SAID THAT EVEN HAVING TO DO THE OPT-OUT PAPERWORK MIGHT VIOLATE COMPANY'S RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES.
OH DEAR LORD, SO A COMPANY'S PRINCIPLES COULD BE ALMOST ANYTHING. JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES OPPOSE BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS. SCIENTOLOGISTS OBJECT TO ANTIDEPRESSANTS.  I IMAGINE THE AMISH AREN'T TOO KEEN ON AMBULANCES. WHERE DOES THIS... WHERE DOES THIS END?
I GUESS... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE IT ENDS.
Jon: WHOA. WHOA.
JON, I'LL TELL YOU WHERE THIS ALL ENDS. IT ENDS WITH PANTLESS MONDAYS.
Jon: JASON, WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS. YOU CANNOT COME TO WORK WITHOUT PANTS. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
YOU'RE RIGHT. I CAN'T, BUT MY CORPORATION JONESY WONESY HAS A BONESY LLC CAN DO WHATEVER THE [BLEEPED] IT WANTS. AND AS A DEVOTELY RELIGIOUS CORPORATION, I CANNOT LET PANTS JEOPARDIZE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE BABY I HAVE GROWING IN MY DICK. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M SORRY. THE WHAT NOW?
YOU HEARD ME, JON. I'VE GOT A DICK BABY.
Jon: I DON'T. REALLY, JASON, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A DICK BABY.
I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS.
JON, HE'S BEEN DOING THIS DICK BABY THING ALL DAMN DAY.
DON'T BELITTLE MY FAITH, WOMAN!
Jon: ALRIGHT. JASON, YOUR FAITH WOULDN'T BY ANY CHANCE ALSO FORBID YOU TO FLUSH THE TOILET AFTER YOU USE IT, WOULD YOU?
NO JON, THAT'S IN THE BIBLE. LEVITICUS 721: THOU SHALT NOT TOUCH NO UNCLEAN THING.
Jon: WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.
YES, YOU WILL, JON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT SOUND?
JON, WE TIED A BELL TO HIS DONG SO WE KNOW WHEN HE'S COMING.
Jon: I DO HAVE TO SAY, JASON, AS I... I HOPE, IT LOOKS LIKE THE CAMERA ADDS TEN POUNDS. [LAUGHTER]
I DON'T... OH, NO, NO, NO, THAT'S THE BABY WEIGHT.
Jon: ALRIGHT. JESSICA WILLIAMS AND JASON JONES, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
