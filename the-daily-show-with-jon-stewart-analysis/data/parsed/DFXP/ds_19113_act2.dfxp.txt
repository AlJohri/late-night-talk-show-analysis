[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JON: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW WITH THE 2014 MIDTERMS ON THE HORIZON, FEEL THE EXCITEMENT IN THE ROOM. THE REPUBLICANS ARE MORE CERTAIN THAN EVER IN THEIR DOCTRINES. CUTTING TAXES CREATES JOBS. HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT KILLS JOBS. MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN. MONEY IS SPEECH. GUNS ARE A GO TO ACCESSORY FOR ANY OUTFIT. [LAUGHING]
JON: THEY MAKE A LOVELY COUPLE. IT'S A STRATEGY THAT HAS DIFFICULTIES WHEN TRYING TO APPEAL TO MODERATE VOTERS THOUGH WHO MAY VALUE THINGS LIKE EVIDENCE. AS OPPOSED TO THE BASE WHO BELIEVE "ANGLES IN THE OUTFIELD" IS A DOCUMENTARY. NOT EVERY CANDIDATE CAN BRIDGE THAT GAP. LIKE MICHELLE BACHMAN. SHE CAME OUT FORCEFULLY AGAINST THE HPV VACCINE BECAUSE AS SHE STATED IT CAUSES BRAIN DAMAGE.
I AM NOT A DOCTOR, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. I'M NOT A PHYSICIAN. ALL I WAS DOING WAS REPORTING WHAT THIS WOMAN TOLD ME LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE.
JON: IF WE CAN'T MAKE LAWS BASED ON WHAT SOME LADY TELLS YOU AT A DEBATE, I GUESS THE NAZIS HAVE WON. YOU DON'T HEAR THAT AS -- [ APPLAUSE ]
JON: YA. OUT OF CONTEXT, THE AUDIENCE APPLAUDING THE NAZIS HAVE WON IS GOING TO SEEM A LITTLE WEIRD. OR PERHAPS WHEN ILLINOIS REPRESENTATIVE JOHN SHIMKUS ARGUED WITH CERTAINTY A GREAT PLACE FOR OUR NATION'S NUCLEAR WASTE WOULD NOT  BE NEAR ILLINOIS.
A MOUNTAIN IN A DESSERT IS A SUITABLE PLACE TO PUT HIGH LEVEL NUCLEAR WASTE. I BELIEVE IT IS. BUT, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.
JON: BUT, THERE I GO. I'M NOT A THEME PARK EXPERT EITHER. I ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE FOR A TOXIC WASTE FAMILY FUN ZONE. BUT, THERE IS ONE THING, ONE THING THE GOP IS SUPER, SUPER, SUPER SURE ABOUT. AND, IT'S THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT REAL. AND EVEN IF IT WAS REAL WE SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING. IN FACT STALLING AND BLOCKING CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION AT EVERY TURN IS WHAT THEY DO. LIKE THIS WEEK WHEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY RELEASED LONG AWAITED GUIDLINES AIMED TO REDUCE CARBON POLLUTION BY 30%. CUE THE REPUBLICAN'S TOP CLIMATOLOGIST.
EVERY PROPOSAL THAT HAS COME OUT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE INVOLVES HURTING THE ECONOMY AND KILLING AMERICAN JOBS. THAT CAN'T BE THE PRESCRIPTION FOR DEALING WITH CHANGES IN OUR CLIMATE.
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER SAID THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN IS NUTS.
JON: BONKERS. THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN IS [BEEP] KNUCKLEHEADED. THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN IS  BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH! [LAUGHING]
JON: AND HE SHOULD KNOW. THIS MAN HAS A VERY IMPRESSIVE SET OF SCIENTIFIC CREDENTIALS. SUCH AS.
I'M NOT QUALIFIED TO DEBATE THE SCIENCE OVER CLIMATE CHANGE.
JON: THEN WHY DO YOU? EVEN THOUGH -- [ APPLAUSE ]
JON: -- EVEN THOUGH HE ONLY HAS A BA IN GUT FEELINGS IT'S NOT LIKE THAT LACK OF QUALIFICATION HAS STOPPED HIM FROM HAVING THAT DEBATE.
WHAT IS THE REPUBLICAN PLAN TO DEAL WITH CARBON EMISSION WHICH EVERY SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATION HAS SAID IT'S CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE?
GEORGE THE IDEA THAT CARBON DIOXIDE IS A CARCINOGEN THAT'S HARMFUL TO OUR ENVIRONMENT IS ALMOST COMICAL. EVERY TIME WE EXHALE WE EXHALE CARBON DIOXIDE.
JON: YES. YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH CARBON DIOXIDE. THAT'S WHY I KEPT MY PET HAMSTER IN A BOX WITH NO HOLES IN IT. HE'S DOING GREAT. HE'S BEEN ASLEEP FOR THREE YEARS. IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME CURRENT STORY WHERE REPUBLICANS HAD ACTUAL EXPERTISE LIKE ON THE BIRHDAHL TALIBAN PRISON SWAP --
EARLIER TODAY PRESIDENT OBAMA DEFENDED THE PRISONER SWAP. HERE TO RESPOND, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST AND WAR STORIES HOST, OUR FRIEND COLONEL OLIVER NORTH.
I KNOW A LOT ABOUT HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS.
JON: YOU'RE NOT [BEEP] KIDDING. THAT'S FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBER OLIVER IRAN CONTRA NORTH ENGAGING IN WHAT WE IN THE BUSINESS CALL UNDERSTATEMENT. A MAN WHO BACK IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION GAINED A GREAT DEAL OF HANDS-ON TERRORIST NEGOTIATING EXPERIENCE WHEN HE HELPED TRADE 2000 MISSILES TO THE COUNTRY IRAN FOR HELP IN TRYING TO FREE 7 AMERICANS BEING HELD IN LEBANON AND THEN USED THE MONEY FROM THAT MISSLE SALE TO FUND NICARAGUAN CONTRAS OR AS THEY WERE SOMETIMES REFERED TO COKE-FUELED JUNGLE DEATH SQUADS. WHAT WOULD THIS INDIVIDUAL THINK OF THE BERGDAHL DEAL?
WAS A RANSOM WAS PAID TO THE HAQQANI'S? IF A RANSOM WAS PAID EITHER AT OUR BEHEFT OR WITH AMERICAN TAX DOLLARS IT MEANS THIS GOVERNMENT IS CAUSING TO BE FUNDED A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE THAT KILLS AMERICANS. THE HAQQANIS.
JON: SO, YOU ARE SAYING IT NOW LIKE IT'S A BAD THING. DOES IT MAKE YOU MAD BECAUSE IT'S GONE MAINSTREAM? I WAS INTO USING AMERICAN TAXPAYER MONEY TO ARM TERRORIST GROUPS WAY BEFORE IT WAS COOL. BUT AS ALWAYS, COLONEL NORTH MAKES THE ARGUMENT THAT THE REAL TRAGEDY HERE IS THE TRANSPARENCY.
IT'S A DISASTER THE WAY THIS HAS ALL COME OUT. THE REALITY IS THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT IT. RONALD REAGAN DIDN'T AND THIS GUY SHOULDN'T OF DONE IT.
JON: FINALLY SOME PRACTICAL ADVICE FROM AN INFORMED VOICE ON THE RIGHT. YOU CAN OVER STEP YOUR AUTHORITY JUST LIE THE [BEEP] OUT OF IT AFTERWARDS. THAT'S THE MORE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
