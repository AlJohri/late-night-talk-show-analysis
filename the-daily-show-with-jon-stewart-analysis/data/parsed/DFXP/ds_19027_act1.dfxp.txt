FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY NAME IS JON STEWART. AN EXCELLENT ONE TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT MR. TOM BROKAW. JENNIFER LAWRENCE WAS SCHEDULED. SHE'LL BE ON TOMORROW NIGHT. TONIGHT IS TOM BROKAW. BOTH TALKING ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION OF JOHN F. KENNEDY. TOO SOON. [LAUGHTER] A LITTLE WHILE BACK ON THE PROGRAM I PERSONALLY DON'T WATCH IT, I THINK IT'S CRASS. [ LAUGHTER ] I MAY HAVE MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT CHICAGO-STYLE PIZZA AND HOW IT TENDED TO BE LESS PIZZA-ISH THAN PIZZA. I WAS GESTICULATING QUITE A BIT DURING THAT CLIP. IN ARTICULATING THAT SENTIMENT, I MAY HAVE IMPLIED THAT DEEP DISH PIZZA TASTES LIKE A STRING CHEESE THAT HAD BEEN BAKED FOR TWO HOURS INSIDE OF MIKE DITKA'S ASS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I SAID THAT ON A -- MY PROGRAM AND APPARENTLY CHICAGO HAS TELEVISION. [LAUGHTER] [CHICAGOANS ARE NO DOUBT TAKING PERSONAL OFFENSE TO THE "THE DAILY SHOW" HOST'S JON STEWART'S RANT AGAINST OUR DEEP DISH PIZZA.
JON STEWART TRASHING OUR PIZZA.
I TAKE BIG OFFENSE BECAUSE CHICAGO STYLE DEEP DISH IS THE BEST.
PICKING ON OUR PIZZA.
A RIBBING.
TAKE A BITE IT'S IRRESISTIBLE.
I'M NOT A DEEP DISH FAN, MYSELF. I LOVE THIN CRUST. I COULD GET HATE MAIL. I USED TO SHIP IT FROZEN TO CALIFORNIA.
I'M NOT A DEEP DISH FAN.
Jon: GET TO THE TRAFFIC AND WEATHER ALREADY! [LAUGHTER] I'M LATE AND I NEED TO KNOW IF I NEED TO WEAR A COAT. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT MY CONTRIBUTION TO THE PIZZA DIALOG WAS NOT PARTICULARLY WELL REASONED.
JON STEWART WENT ON A RANT.
STEWART FIRED OFF A TIRADE, IT CONTINUED LIKE THAT FOR A WHILE IN THE CHEESY NEW YORK ACCENT.
Jon: CHEESY NEW YORK ACCENT WHO THE (bleep) DO YOU THINK YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A CHEESY NEW YORK ACCENT YOU SON -- YOU FORGET -- WAIT A MINUTE, YOU KNOW? I HEAR IT NOW. YOU ARE RIGHT. IT IS SOMEWHAT PRONOUNCED. IF I WAS RANTING -- WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY IT WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT PEOPLE ON TWITTER WERE RANTING BACK. LIKE (bleep) YOU JON STEWART FOR SAYING DEEP DISH PIZZA ISN'T PIZZA, DIE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT PARTICULAR TWITTER USER DID NOT SPECIFY THE METHOD BY WHICH I SHOULD DIE BUT I ONLY ASSUME IT WOULD BE POISONING BY DEEP DISH PIZZA. [ LAUGHTER ] WHENEVER THERE'S A SPIRITED BACK AND FORTH YOU KNOW CHICAGO MAYOR RAHM EMMANUEL IS GETTING INVOLVED. THIS IS THE GIFT THAT RAHM EMMANUEL SENT TO JON STEWART ON "THE DAILY SHOW".
SHOWING EVEN A DOG REJECTING A DEEP DISH PIZZA FROM THE MAYOR.
Jon: THAT'S ONE OF "THE DAILY SHOW" DOGS QALY. HE DIDN'T WANT THE PIZZA BUT I HAVE SEEN THAT DOG EAT NOT ONLY GARBAGE BUT HAPPILY SPEND HIS ENTIRE DAY WITH HIS NOSE IN ANOTHER DOG'S BUTT HOLE. THE OTHER DOG IS PARKER. IN HIS DEFENSE, PARKER HAS AN AMAZING BUTT HOLE. ELEGANT. SOPHISTICATED. WITH JUST A SOUCIANT OF SNASAUGE. A LITTLE BIT OF JUNGLE FEVER, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAY SOMETHING IN YEAH. PERHAPS I OVERREACTED WITH MY RANT TIRADE BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF HOW SPECIAL PIZZA IS TO ALL OF US IN NEW YORK CITY. IT'S NOT JUST A FOOD TO US. IT'S -- TAKE A LOOK.
IF THERE'S ONE THING I LEARNED FROM PRETENDING TO BE AMERICAN ALL THESE YEARS IT'S THAT NEW YORK HAS THE BEST (bleep) PIZZA ON THE (bleep) PLANET. DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
I LOVE CHICAGO. YOU MAY REMEMBER I LED A PARADE THERE BUT NOBODY BEATS NEW YORK. CHICAGO, YOU KNOW, THE PIZZA IS ALL RIGHT. IT'S GOOD. IT'S ALL RIGHT. HAVE YOU TRIED NEW YORK PIZZA?
WHAT MAKES NEW YORK PIZZA SO PERFECT?
IT'S NOT THE CRUST, THE SAUCE, THE MOZZARELLA? IT'S THE MAGIC.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN MAGIC. MAYBE THAT'S NOT MAGIC'S PROBLEM. MAYBE IT'S YOUR (bleep) PROBLEM.
YES, NEW YORK PIZZA IS MAGIC IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR US. WHEN WE STRUGGLED AND NEEDED A HELPING HAND.
HOLY (bleep). I CAN WALK.
LET'S SEE YOU DO THAT, DEEP DISH! WHEN WE WERE STUCK AND JUST WANTED TO GET HOME. ENJOY YOUR RIDE. WHOA! WHEN WE WERE JUST TRYING TO GET HEALTH CARE AND THE GODDAMN SITE WOULDN'T LOAD. WATCH THIS. TRY IT NOW. â™ª  WHEN WE WERE DISAPPOINTED AND NEEDED A LIFT -- TRUST ME YOU ARE GOING TO LIKE THIS. THANK YOU PIZZA. GOD, I LOOK GOOD.
YOU SURE AS (bleep) DO.
YOU WANT TO KISS ME, DON'T YOU?
YES, I DO.
NEW YORK PIZZA MAKES THE BAD >TIMES GOOD, GOOD TIMES BETTERD AND THE BETTER TIMES BETTERRER. YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER. ANYWAY THE POINT IS:  CHICAGO, RELAX.
YEAH, CHICAGO WE'RE SORRY FOR IMPLYING YOUR PIZZA IS INEDIBLE. IT'S EDIBLE.
CONGRATULATIONS, CHICAGO, YOUR PIZZA IS EDIBLE IT'S JUST NOT MAGIC. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
