FROM COMEDY CENTRAL IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A NICE ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. THE GREAT GEOFFREY RUSH WILL BE JOINING US. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH HEALTHCARE.GOV, RHYMES WITH LOVE. LAST WE CHECKED IN THE EMBATTLED OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS MAKING A SIMPLE PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
BY THE END OF THIS MONTH WE ANTICIPATE THAT IT IS GOING TO BE WORKING THE WAY THAT IT WILL SUPPOSE TO.
IT WILL TAKE TO THE END OF NOVEMBER FOR AN OPTIMALLY FUNCTIONING WEB SITE.
WE WILL HAVE IT FULLY FUNCTIONING BY THE END OF NOVEMBER.
Jon: FULLY FUNCTIONING BY NOVEMBER? BUT AS OF NOW FOR SOME REASON THE SITE CONTINUES TO GIVE PEOPLE HEPATITIS. WE DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER) WELL, TODAY THE PRESIDENT CALLED A PRESS CONFERENCE TO MAKE A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROMISE OF A FULLY FUNCTIONAL WEB SITE BY NOVEMBER 30th.
THE WEB SITE WILL WORK MUCH BETTER ON NOVEMBER 30th, DECEMBER 1st THAN IT WORKED CERTAINLY ON OCTOBER 1st. THAT'S A PRETTY LOW BAR BY THE TIME WE LOOK BACK ON THIS NEXT YEAR THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY, THIS IS WORKING WELL.
Jon: LET, LET ME BE CLEAR. WHEN I SAID END OF NOVEMBER, I DID NOT SAY WHICH NOVEMBER. (LAUGHTER) LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T JUST CALL ALL OF US TOGETHER TO LOWER OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE WEB SITE.
THERE ARE GOING TO BE UPS AND DOWNS DURING THE COURSE OF MY PRESIDENCY. I THINK I SAID EARLY ON WHEN I WAS RUNNING I AM NOT A PERFECT MAN AND I WILL NOT BE A PERFECT PRESIDENT. BUT I WILL WAKE UP EVERY SINGLE DAY WORKING AS HARD AS I CAN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT WASN'T THE SLOGAN YOU CAMPAIGNED ON. I THINK WHEN YOU CAMPAIGNED YOU WERE ALL "YES, WE CAN" I DON'T REMEMBER THE OTHER SLOGAN. (LAUGHTER) BUT I'M SORRY, YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING?
WE FUMBLED THE ROLLOUT ON THIS HEALTH CARE LAW. THAT'S ON US, NOT ON THEM. IT'S NOT ON THEM, IT'S ON US. THAT'S ON ME. AND AGAIN, THAT'S ON US. WHICH IS WHY-- S THAT'S ON ME.
IT'S ME, I DID IT, I [BLEEP] UP. DO ME A FAVOR, JUST KICK MY ASS, OKAY. KICK THIS ASS, THAT'S ALL. I'M NOT ASKING, I'M TELLING WITH THIS. KICK MY ASS.
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. THE WEB SITE, THE WEB SITE FIASCO HAS BASICALLY TURNED OUR PRESIDENT INTO ARTIE FUFFKIN. BUT OF COURSE FOR EVERY CLOUD THERE IS A SILVER LINING. CERTAINLY THE ROLLOUT FOR THE PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENT HAS BEEN ROCKY. BUT AT LEAST IT HAS NOT BEEN MAYOR OF TORONTO ROCKY. OR AS THE MAYOR IS NOW REFERRED TO --
THE CRACK-SMOKING MAYOR OF TORONTO--  (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: TORONTO MAYOR AND INTREPID INTOXICANT AFFICIONADO ROB FORD YESTERDAY APPEARED BEFORE THE MIGHTY TORONTO CITY COUNCIL. AS CROWDS OF HIS SUPPORTIVE CONSTITUENTS GATHERED OUTSIDE. SO THAT'S WHERE SOUTH PARK GOT THAT. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, FORD HAS SOME SPLANING TO DO.
MR. MAYOR, DO YOU STILL HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR DRUGS, GUNS AND GANGS?
ABSOLUTELY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WAIT, DID YOU SAY ZERO TOLERANCE FOR DRUGS OR JIM MORISON LIKE HIGH TOLERANCE FOR DRUGS. BUT THEN INEVITABLY THE $64,000 QUESTION OR WHATEVER CRACK COSTS IN CANADA.
HAVE YOU PURCHASED ILLEGAL DRUGS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS?
YES, I HAVE.
Jon: THE PAUSE BEFORE MAYOR FORD TO ANSWER THAT FACTUALLY YES OR NO QUESTION WAS 8 SECONDS LONG. 8 SECONDS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HE WAS THINKING IN THE INTERVAL. BUT WE THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THIS.
HAVE YOU PURCHASED ILLEGAL DRUGS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS?
YES, I HAVE.
Jon: GOING THROUGH THE HEADLINES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MAYBE IN THOSE EIGHT SECONDS MAYOR FORD WAS TRULY TRYING TO REMEMBER THE LAST TIME HE BOUGHT CRACK OR MAYBE HE WAS DOING THE HOMER SIMPSON THING, EXHORTING HIMSELF NOT TO SAY YES BEFORE BLURTING OUT YES, DOUGH! OR PERHAPS HE WAS JUST PAUSING FOR DRAMATIC GAME SHOW CONTESTANT AFFECT.
HAVE YOU PURCHASED ILLEGAL DRUGS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS?
YES, I HAVE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THERE, HE DID IT. HE WON! THAT WAS OUR-- ULTIMATELY THE COUNCIL VOTED 37-5 TO REQUEST NONBINDINGLY IF THE MAYOR WOULD CONSIDER, RESPECTFULLY, A LEAVE OF ABSENCE SIR, PLEASE. OR AS THAT'S KNOWN UP THERE, JUSTICE, CANADIAN STYLE. BUT OF COURSE DRUG PURCHASES TURN OUT TO BE THE TIP OF THE ROB FORD.
NEW BOMBSHELL ALLEGATIONS INCLUDING ACCUSATIONS THAT FORD CONSORTED WITH A SUSPECTED PROSTITUTE, SNORTED COCAINE, DROVE WHILE DRINKING AND SMOKED A JOINT WITH TWO WOMEN.
Jon: AND THEN AFTER LUNCH--  (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT, THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE GOING TO KEEP SURFACING. ALL THE GUY HAS TO DO IS JUST LAY LOW, GET SOME PROFESSIONAL HELP, AND THEN IT'S ALL GOING TO BLOW OVER. AND CUE HIM THIS MORNING TALKING TO THE PRESS.
A SHORT TIME AGO MAYOR FORD DENIED A WOMAN THAT HE MET WAS A PROSTITUTE.
ALANA IS NOT A PROSTITUTE. SHE'S A FRIEND. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH I HAVE TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE WAITER THAT SAID I WAS DOING LINES AT THE BEER MARKET. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: [BLEEP] GUY IS A ONE-MAN EPISODE OF COPS. BUT ALL OF THIS, THE ALLEGATIONS, THE INTOXICATED RANT TAPES, THE CRACK SMOKING HE BELIEVES IS EXCUSED SOMEHOW BY HIS RAMPANT ALCOHOLISM, ALL OF THIS PALES IN COMPARISON TO THIS NEXT MOMENT. I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION AT HOME. DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN? BECAUSE IF YOU DO, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO RIGHT NOW AND WAKE THEM UP AND BRING THEM DOWNSTAIRS. AND GATHER THEM AROUND THE TELEVISION SET. I KNOW THEY'VE GOT SCHOOL TOMORROW BUT I THINK YOU'LL AGREE ONCE YOU SEE THIS CLIP, IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN SCHOOL. THIS NEXT CLIP WILL ASTONISH AND AMAZE YOU. THIS IS TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD ADDRESSING ALLEGATIONS THAT HE SEXUALLY HARASSED ONE OF HIS STAFFERS.
ON THE LAST THING WAS OLIVIA, IT SAYS THAT I WANT TO EAT HER [BLEEP].
I HAVE NEVER SAID THAT IN MY LIFE TO HER. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT I'M HAPPILY MARRIED. I HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO EAT AT HOME! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT? WHAT? WHAT! WHAT! WHAT! SOMEWHERE IN A BASEMENT THROUGH HIS TEARS ANTHONY WEINER IS GOING WHAT THE [BLEEP]? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) [BLEEP] ALL YOU CAN EAT BUFFET AT HOME! IN FACT, THE ONLY THING THAT GETS ME THROUGH THE RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF NONSTOP CUNNILINGUS I HAVE TO PERFORM IS THE SWEET RELIEF OF CRACK. LET ME BEG YOU, SIR, LET ME BEG YOU. MAYOR ROB FORD OF TORONTO, LET THAT BE YOUR LAST STATEMENT. THROW DOWN THE MIC. MAKE THAT YOUR LAST SENTENCE OF YOUR ENTIRE CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE CALL IN MY BUSINESS, A CLOSER
