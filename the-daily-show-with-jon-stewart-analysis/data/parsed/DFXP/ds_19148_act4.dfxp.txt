Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW. SO LISTEN, THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE IN MY BUSINESS THAT YOU COULD SAY ARE OR WERE ACTUALLY GROUND-BREAKING TALENTS. JOAN RIVERS WAS ONE OF THEM. UNFORTUNATELY SHE'S PASSED AWAY. WE SEND OUR VERY BEST OUT TO HER FAMILY. WE'RE ALL THINKING OF YOU. ANYWAY, HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
A GIRL CAN'T CALL. GIRL, YOU HAVE THE WAIT FOR THE PHONE TO RING, RIGHT. AND WHEN YOU FINALLY GO ON THE DATE, THE GIRL HAS TO BE WELL DRESSED. HER FACE HAS THE LOOK NICE. THEIR HAIR HAS TO BE IN SHAPE. THE GIRL HAS TO BE THE ONE THAT'S BRIGHT AND PRETTY, INTELLIGENT, A GOOD SPORT. HOWARD JOHNSON'S AGAIN, HOORAY, HOORAY.
