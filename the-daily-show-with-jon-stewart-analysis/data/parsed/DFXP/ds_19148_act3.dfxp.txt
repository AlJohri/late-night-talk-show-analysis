[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE FRONT MAN OF MAROON 5. THEIR BRAND-NEW ALBUM IS CALLED "V." PLEASE WELCOME ADAM LEVINE. ADAM LEVINE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FIRST OF ALL, RELAX. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE INTIMIDATED BY MY LOOKS. I WANT YOU TO RELAX.
THANK YOU FOR SAYING IT.
Jon: YOU'RE VERY, VERY WELCOME, SIR. HOW ARE YOU? YOU ARE THE BUSIEST MAN IN SHOW BUSINESS THAT I'M AWARE OF, PUTTING OUT A NEW ALBUM, YOU'RE HOSTING "THE VOICE," YOU'RE BEING IN THE MOVIES, YOU GOT MARRIED. YOU'RE DOING, THIS IS, IS THIS THE MOST WHIRLWINDISH OF TIMES FOR YOU?
IT'S PRETTY CRAZY. IT'S SO MUCH FUN, AND, THIS BY THE WAY, I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MY MOTHER'S OBSESSED WITH YOU. MY WIFE IS OBSESSED WITH HIM. MY BAND IS OBSESSED WITH YOU IN A CREEPY WAY.
Jon: HERE'S WHAT'S CRAZY, I APPARENTLY HAVE THE WRONG PERSON ON MY SHOW THEN. WHERE ARE ALL... YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN OBSESSED WITH YOU SIN KARA'S FLOWERS.
HE'S OBSESSED WITH ME TOO.
DO YOU REMEMBER KARA'S FLOWERS?
I DO. IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
Jon: NO, LOOK AT THE PICTURE. LOOK AT THE PICTURE.
OH FANTASTIC.
Jon: THAT'S YOU.
WOW. THAT IS ME.
THAT'S YOU FROM KARA'S FLOWERS BACK IN THE DAY. WAS THAT THE BAND FROM HIGH SCHOOL?
YEAH, WE'VE BEEN PLAYING SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. AND LOOK AT MY ILL-FITTED TIE.
Jon: I BELIEVE, IF I'M NOT INCORRECT, THAT WAS THE STYLE BACK IN THE DAY.
IT WAS VERY '90s OF ME.
ACTUALLY, WHAT HAPPENED IS, SO A GUY WHO WORKS HERE, HE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH YOUR LITTLE BROTHER, AND SO HE ACTUALLY JUST HAD THAT PICTURE IN HIS CUBICLE.
THAT'S TOTALLY COOL WITH ME.
Jon: THAT'S TOTALLY NOT WEIRD.
THAT'S NOT WEIRD RIGHT? IT'S FINE.
Jon: NOPE.
IT'S NOT TOTALLY CREEPY.
Jon: ARE YOU ENJOYING BEING PART OF "THE VOICE?" DOES THAT, WHAT IS BEING A PART OF "THE VOICE." LIKE, YOU'RE A ROCK STAR. YOU'RE OUT THERE EVERY NIGHT, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, THEY'RE CHEERING. TELEVISION IS FOR, YOU KNOW, IT'S A GRIND. NOBODY LIKES YOU. THE PEOPLE COMMENT ON THE YOUTUBE. [WHISTLING] EXACTLY. WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO DO THAT?
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, IT TURNED INTO THIS THING AND IT STARTED OFF AS JUST A RISKY, WEIRD IDEA THAT MARK BURNETT, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVER MET HIM, MARK BURNETT IS VERY CONVINCING.
RIGHT. HE'S THE PRODUCER OF "THE VOICE."
HE'S THE PRODUCER OF EVERY SHOW THAT'S HUGE.
Jon: "SURVIVOR", I THINK, RIGHT?
HE'S LIKE A MEGAPRODUCER OF THE WORLD.
Jon: YES. RIGHT.
AND HE'S LIKE, YOU GOT TO DO THIS, IT'D BE GREAT. THAT'S WHAT HE SOUNDS LIKE WHEN HE TALKS.
Jon: DOES HE REALLY?
YOU GOTTA DO IT. HE'S LIKE REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC AND KIND OF ENGLISH BUT KIND OF OTHER THINGS, TOO.
Jon: WAIT? WHAT OTHER THINGS?
IT'S LIKE, IT'S LIKE AN ALL-OVER-THE-PLACE ACCENT. IT'S NOT QUITE ONE THING.
HE JUST KIND OF THROWS IT AROUND?
AND HE'S ALWAYS SAYING, HE'S A REALLY EXCITED, ENERGETIC DUDE. HE HATES ME NOW FOR DOING THIS INTERVIEW.
Jon: NO, NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL.
BUT HE WAS JUST REALLY CONVINCING. AND IT WAS A GREAT IDEA.
Jon: YES.
THE SHOW WAS A GREAT IDEA. THE CONCEPT WAS COOL. I THOUGHT, WHY NOT? IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE HUGE.
Jon: IT'S HUGE.
IT WILL BE A YEAR AND IT'S BEEN LIKE THREE YEARS, SEVEN SEASONS. IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I THINK THAT HONESTLY, AND YOU CAN TELL THAT YOU HAVE FUN DOING WHAT YOU DO...
Jon: YES.
AND I THINK THAT IF YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME DOING IT OR AT LEAST MOST OF THE TIME, OR I WOULD ASSUME...
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
IT'S A BLAST. IF YOU'RE HAVING A BLAST AND YOU'RE HAVING FUN AND MESSING AROUND AND IT'S GOOD AND IT'S REALLY REWARDING TO WORK WITH THESE GUYS WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT...
WHO ARE THESE NEW GUYS, THEY GOT TWO NEW CAST MEMBERS YES?
GWEN --
GWEN STEFANI --
STEFANI AND FARRELL -- WHICH IS AWESOME. AND THEY WERE LIKE, LIKE INSTANTLY...
Jon: RIGHT.
INSTANTANEOUSLY IT WAS JUST LIKE THE CHEMISTRY WAS LIKE INCREDIBLE, AND WE'RE JUST HAVING SO MUCH FUN.
Jon: IS THIS A GOOD SEASON, IT'S A GOOD SEASON THEN?
I ALWAYS SAY IT'S GOING TO BE THE BEST SEASON EVER
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
AND THIS IS OUR BEST ALBUM EVER. AND I ALWAYS SAY THOSE THINGS AND I BELIEVE THOSE THINGS.
Jon: THIS ALBUM. I'M GOING TO PUT THIS UP HERE. IT'S CALLED "V." I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT IT'S YOUR SIXTH OR SEVENTH ALBUM.
IT'S ACTUALLY OUR FIFTH ALBUM.
Jon: WELL, THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL.
IT DOESN'T. IT DOESN'T. WHAT KEEPS YOU GUYS TOGETHER? YOU'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR MANY YEARS. WHAT KEEPS A BAND TOGETHER? YOU KNOW, THERE ARE MANY STRESSES THAT PULL PEOPLE APART, YOU HAVE GOTTEN AN AWFUL LOT OF ATTENTION INDIVIDUALLY. WHAT KEEPS THE BAND TOGETHER AND STILL COLLABORATING WELL?
I THINK THAT ADAPTABILITY, YOU KNOW, AND KIND OF BEING FEARLESSLY KIND OF WANTING TO JUST TRY NEW THINGS...
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE I THINK THAT A LOT OF TIMES BANDS ESPECIALLY, WE GET STUCK IN OUR WAYS AND WE WANT TO DO THINGS ONE WAY AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND THEN REALIZE, AND WE'VE BEEN IN THAT POSITION WITH OUR CAREERS BEFORE, TOO, BUT WHEN WE STARTED KIND OF BEING OPEN TO DOING THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND TRYING NEW STYLES AND NEW SOUNDS, WHICH WE ALSO GET PERSECUTED FOR BY OUR FANS, SO, BUT I DON'T CARE.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT I LOVE THEM, YOU KNOW, BUT WE'LL DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO, AND THAT WILL BE GREAT.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, OVER TEN, 20 YEARS, YOU HAVE TO KIND OF CHANGE IT UP A LITTLE BIT. I THINK THAT ALL OF OUR FAVORITE BANDS HAVE ALWAYS DONE THAT. SO TRYING NEW THINGS,.
Jon: HAVE YOU REALLY BEEN TOGETHER TEN TO 20 YEARS?
WELL SINCE THAT PHOTO, IN THAT PHOTO...
Jon: RIGHT.
THERE ARE THREE OF THE GUYS THAT ARE IN THE BAND STILL SINCE WE WERE 12 YEARS OLD.
Jon: THAT'S AMAZING.
MY BOYS.
Jon: SINCE YOU WERE 12 YEARS OLD TOGETHER?
YEAH.
Jon: I BET SOMEBODY'S GOT SOME PHOTOS IN A SHOEBOX THAT...
YEAH, SOME REALLY EMBARRASSING PHOTOS.
Jon: I WOULD IMAGINE SO. NOW, ARE YOU CALLING IT "V" OR ARE YOU CALLING IT FIVE?
HERE'S THE THING, HERE'S THE DEAL, I DON'T REALLY EVEN KNOW ANYMORE.
Jon: REALLY?
LIKE, CAUSE, WELL CAUSE, IT'S MAROON 5, IT'S OUR FIFTH ALBUM, LET'S CALL IT SOMETHING THAT RESEMBLES THAT. THEN IT WAS V. THEN IT WAS 5. THEN I FORGOT BECAUSE IT'S EVERYONE'S QUESTION. IS WHAT IS IT. AND I'M LIKE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW. I'VE BEEN CONFUSED CONSTANTLY, SO I THINK...
Jon: YOU REALLY JUST GO WHEREVER THEY TELL YOU TO GO, DON'T YOU?
YOU KNOW WHAT, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.
Jon: MAROON 5. IT'S THEIR FIFTH ALBUM, IT'S IN STORES NOW. THEY'RE GOING TO START TOURING IN FEBRUARY. AND CATCH THE NEW SEASON OF "THE VOICE" BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 22nd ON NBC. THE VERY BUSY, ADAM LEVINE. THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY.
