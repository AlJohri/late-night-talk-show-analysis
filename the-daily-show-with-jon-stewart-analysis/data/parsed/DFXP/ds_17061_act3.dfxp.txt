(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SERVED FOR 18 YEARS AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "WHILE AMERICA SLEEPS: A WAKEUP CALL FOR THE POST-9/11 ERA."  WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM RUSS FEINGOLD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU?
VERY GOOD. THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED "WHILE AMERICA SLEEPS." IT IS ONE OF THE SCARIEST  BEDTIME STORIES YOU COULD EVER READ. (LAUGHTER) IT'S A CHILDREN'S BOOK, AM I RIGHT? PICTURES TO COME.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: IT SORT OF BEGINS 9/11 AND SORT OF HOW... TALKS ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT LOST OUR  MINDS A LITTLE BIT, WENT INTO IRAQ, DID A LOT OF THINGS. AS YOU'RE WATCHING NOW-- AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH THE  AUDIENCE EARLIER-- DO YOU FEEL US MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION AGAIN WITH IRAN? AND DO YOU THINK... IS IT EASY FOR AMERICA TO BOMB THEM SINCE IT'S ONLY REALLY ONE LETTER OFF ANYWAY? (LAUGHTER)
THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONFUSION. THE PROBLEM IS AFTER 9/11 WE SORT OF HAD THINGS RIGHT FOR A WHILE. THERE WAS SORT OF A FEELING OF UNITY, WE WERE GOING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. THE WAY WE WENT INTO AFGHANISTAN WAS MEASURED. BUT THEN IRAQ OCCURRED AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE DECIDED WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING... IT WAS LIKE A  GAME OF RISK. YOU HAD TO INVADE A COUNTRY AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR TROOPS THERE. THEN YOU INVADE ANOTHER COUNTRY. SO WE DID AFGHANISTAN, WE DID IRAQ, AND NOW IT FEELS LIKE INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THE GLOBAL  THREAT OF AL QAEDA AND OTHER ISSUES, NOW IT'S ALL IRAN. IRAN 24 HOURS A DAY BECAUSE IT SUIT IT IS PURPOSES OF THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATES WHO WANT  TO TRY TO EMBARRASS THE PRESIDENT. SO WE DON'T HAVE THE GLOBAL ATTENTION THAT I THOUGHT WE ALL AGREED WE HAD TO HAVE AFTER WE  WERE SURPRISED AND AWAKENED ON 9/11.
Jon: COULDN'T WE-- IF IT IS RISK-- JUST, AS I WOULD END THOSE GAMES, KNOCK THE BOARD OVER? (LAUGHTER)
IT'S AN IDEA. I'D PREFER THE GAME OF SCRABBLE IN THIS SITUATION.
Jon: SURE. SURE.
WHERE YOU HAVE TO KIND OF THINK IN TWO DIRECTIONS. YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT YEMEN IS CLOSE TO SOMALIA AND THAT'S CLOSE TO WHERE THERE'S AN  ISLAMIC GROUP IN NORTHERN AFRICA WHO ARE CREATING SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS.
Jon: WAIT, YOU'RE NOT SAYING THAT WE SHOULD BOMB THEM?
HERE'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO. WE OUGHT TO AT LEAST KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. AND WE DON'T HAVE A PRESENCE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD.
Jon: IT'S CHANGING SO QUICKLY. EVEN THE TIME IT TOOK TO JUST PRINT UP A BOOK-- A LOT OF THIS FOCUSES ON YEMEN AND SOMALIA--  NOW IT'S SHIFTED TO SYRIA AND IRAN AND SO MANY OTHER PLACES. IT MOVES SO QUICKLY WE ALMOST DON'T HAVE TIME.
IT'S HARD. THE ANALOGY I USE IS WHEN WE WERE KIDS THERE WERE JUST SEVEN OR EIGHT...
Jon: IS THIS ABOUT RISK AGAIN?
THIS ISN'T ABOUT RISK. THIS IS ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT BASEBALL TEAMS WHEN WE WERE KID. WE KNEW ALL THE BASEBALL TEAMS. NOW THE WORLD IS ALSO VERY COMPLICATED COMPARED TO WHAT IT WAS WHEN WE WERE KIDS. WHEN WE WERE KIDS IT WAS THE SOVIET UNION AND THE UNITED STATES. YES, THERE ARE MANY PLACES WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE ANYMORE. WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT WHO IS ACTUALLY WILLING TO WORK WITH US IN PLACES LIKE NORTHERN AFRICA  AND SOUTHEAST ASIA. WE CAN'T GO "GEE, TODAY IT'S IRAN. TOMORROW IT'S YEMEN, THE NEXT DAY IT'S INDONESIA." IT DOESN'T WORK.
Jon: TO SUM UP, YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT WE SHOULD DO LIKE THEY DO IN BASEBALL-- CONSOLIDATE. THERE SHOULD ONLY BE SIX TO EIGHT COUNTRIES?
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. TO MAKE IT LIKE A GAME OF RISK WHERE YOU HAVE THESE HUGE GLOBS OF COUNTRIES.
Jon: CAMPAIGN FINANCE WAS AN ENORMOUS UNDERTAKING FOR YOU. McCAIN-FEINGOLD OBVIOUSLY TOOK YOU... HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO PUT THAT?
IT TOOK EIGHT YEARS TO GET THAT DONE.
Jon: EIGHT YEARS TO GET THAT DONE. SO WHAT IS YOUR FEELING ON THE STATE OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE IN AMERICA TODAY VIS-A-VIS IS THERE ANY? (LAUGHTER)
IT COULD BE BETTER. THE TRUTH IS THAT McCAIN-FEINGOLD WAS BIT ON THIS FOUNDATION AND ACTUALLY WORKED TO STOP DIRECT  CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND POLITICIANS RAISING IT. WHAT THE SUPREME COURT DID IS N CITIZENS UNITED WAS DESTROY THE ENTIRE FOUNDATION AND NOW WE  HAVE CORPORATIONS AND UNIONS ABLE TO USE THEIR TREASURIES DIRECTLY TO DO THE STUFF THEY'VE  NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO SINCE THE GILDED AGE, SINCE TEDDY ROOSEVELT.
Jon: YOU KNOW I REMEMBER AFTER McCAIN-FEINGOLD PASSED THE 527s CAME OUT. WAS THIS A LOOPHOLE THEY FOUND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY?
NO, THEY COULD NOT DO THAT DIRECTLY FROM THE CORPORATE TREASURIES AND ACTUALLY I  BELIEVE THAT WAS ILLEGAL AS WELL AT THE TIME. THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN COURT. WE DON'T HAVE AN AGENCY IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT... THE FEDERAL ELECTIONS COMMISSION  DOESN'T ENFORCE THE LAW. SO WE HAVE A TERRIBLE SITUATION UNLESS THE SUPREME COURT REVERSES, WHICH I THINK IT MAY  AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, IF THE PRESIDENT IS REELECTED AND ABLE TO GET DIFFERENT SUPREME  COURT JUSTICES. IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE A MELTDOWN AND A VERY... THE WORST CORRUPTION PERHAPS IN 100 YEARS.
Jon: IS CITIZENS UNITED THE ISSUE OR IS IT THE ISSUE WHEN THEY ULTIMATELY DECIDED MONEY  EQUALS SPEECH? IS THAT THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL FOUNDATION OF THIS THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT? BECAUSE ONCE YOU DECIDE THAT, AS LONG AS YOUR MONEY DOESN'T YELL  "FIRE" IN A CROWDED THEATER... (LAUGHTER).
WELL, THE COURT NEVER ACTUALLY CONCLUDED THAT MONEY IS SPEECH IN ALL CASES. THEY SAID IF IT CAUSES CORRUPTION OR APPEARANCE OF CORRUPTION YOU CAN REGULATE IT. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE LIMITS ON CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAW. SO THE PROBLEM IS CITIZENS UNITED. IT OVERTURNED A LAW FROM 1907 THAT NOBODY EVER QUESTIONED AND ANOTHER LAW FROM 1947. SO BASICALLY THE SUPREME COURT JUST MADE IT UP. IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST DECISIONS IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY AND IT'S THE ONLY DECISION... (APPLAUSE). IT'S THE ONLY DECISION I CAN REMEMBER THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN KNOWS ABOUT. THEY KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG AND THIS WHOLE THING IS GOING TO  COLLAPSE AND WE'LL HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP.
Jon: EVERYBODY YOU TALKED TO SAYS THAT. THERE'S NOT A POLITICIAN YOU TALK TO DOESN'T SAY "THE BIGGEST  PROBLEM IN OUR SYSTEM IS THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY." "WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT THAT?"  "I DON'T KNOW, WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. ". (LAUGHTER) EVEN McCAIN-FEINGOLD, YOU'RE STILL... THE FOUNDATION IS STILL  THE TERMITE-INFESTED FOUNDATION WE STARTED WITH. WHY WON'T... WHY DOESN'T PUBLIC FINANCING OF ELECTIONS JUST... IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO REGULATE IT, WHY NOT JUST SAY THIS IS THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. THE ELECTIONS ARE 12 WEEKS, IT'S PUBLICLY FINANCED, THIS IS HOW IT GOES.
WELL, PUBLIC FINANCING IS THE ANSWER. WE USED TO HAVE A GOOD SYSTEM FOR PRESIDENTIAL PUBLIC FINANCING AND IT SORT OF WENT BY  THE WAYSIDE, IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. WE'VE NEVER HAD IT FOR CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS.
Jon: WHEN DID IT GO BY THE WAYSIDE?
UNFORTUNATELY IN THE LAST ELECTION PRESIDENT OBAMA DECIDED THAT... CANDIDATE OBAMA DECIDED  NOT TO TAKE PUBLIC FINANCING AND...
Jon: AND HE'S GOING TO DO SUPERPACS NOW.
HE'S GOING TO BE INVOLVED WITH HIS CABINET MEMBERS WITH  THIS AND I DISAGREE AND SANTORUM AND ROMNEY AND GINGRICH ARE GOING TO THEIR ACTUAL SUPER PAC  EVENTS THEMSELVES.
Jon: BUT THEY'RE NOT COORDINATING WITH THEM, JUST TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO.
NO MORE THAN YOUR SUPER PAC IS DOING THAT.
Jon: I WOULD NEVER COORDINATE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU CAN WRITE CHECKS FOR.
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
Jon: KING OF THE WORLD. ARE YOU FEELING HOPEFUL ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE POLITICAL WILL TO GO TO A DIFFERENT SYSTEM OF ELECTIONS?
OH, YEAH. I THINK THIS THING IS GOING TO COME TO A HEAD. I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS YOU AND  OTHERS ARE HAVING WITH YOUR SUPER PACS AND THERE'S GOING TO BE AN EXPLOSION OF CORRUPTION  THAT BRINGS CHANGE JUST LIKE McCAIN-FEINGOLD. IT WAS THE SCANDALS THAT CAME UP...
Jon: WATERGATE?
WATERGATE WAS THE FIRST ONE AND THEN THE $400,000 CHECK FROM THE INDONESIAN GARDENER UNDER  PRESIDENT CLINTON.
Jon: I LOVE HOW THAT ROLLS OFF YOUR TONGUE. $400,000 FROM THE INDONESIAN GARDENER UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON." DO YOU HAVE TWO SECONDS? WE'LL THROW THIS UP ON THE WEB. "WHILE AMERICA SLEEPS." IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. RUSS
