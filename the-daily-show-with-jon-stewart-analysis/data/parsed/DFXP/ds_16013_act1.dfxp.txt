JANUARY 24, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  AUTHOR OF A BOOK ABOUT INDIA. WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE HIM ON A PROGRAM. THERE IS BREAKING NEWS. THAT'S A SIGN THAT WE JUST OUT ABOUT SOMETHING. BUT WHAT WE REALLY WANT YOU TO NOTICE THE THING THAT JUST HAPPENED. I SHOULD CERTAINLY BLOW MY NEWS SHOFAR. SOMETHING HAPPENED. HEY, LOOK! . HEY, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK! LOOK, A UNICORN IN HUMIDITY. WHEN NEWS HAPPENS IN THE NEWS COMMUNITY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GO. WELCOME TO CABLE NEWS NEWS. FRIDAY NIGHT MS-NBC'S BIGGEST STAR KEITH OLBERMANN ANNOUNCED HE WILL NOT BE APPEARING ON MS  BE NBC WHICH IS TOO BAD. ALTHOUGH I COULD TELL THERE WAS PERHAPS TROUBLE WHEN MR. OLBERMANN PARTICIPATED IN  A CAMPAIGN WITH THIS PICTURE. THE TAG LINE SAYS LEAN FORWARD. THE POSTURE SAYS, MAKE ME MOTHER (BEEP). HE WILL BE BACK. MEANWHILE THIS PROGRAM WENT IN PRETTY HIGH AND HARD ON REPRESENTATIVE STEVE COHEN  REPRESENTATIVE OF TENNESSEE TO PLEAD FOR UNDERSTANDING AND COMPASSION FOR POLITICAL  OPPONENTS ONE WEEK BEFORE TAKING TO THE HOUSE FLOOR TO SAY THIS ABOUT HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS.
THEY SAY IT'S A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE. A BIG LIE. JUST LIKE GOEBBELS. YOU SAY IT ENOUGH, YOU REPEAT THE LIE. YOU REPEAT THE LIE. YOU REPEAT THE LIE. EVENTUALLY PEOPLE BELIEVE IT. THE GERMANS SAID ENOUGH ABOUT THE JEWS AND THE PEOPLE BELIEVED IT. YOU HAD THE HOLOCAUST.
Jim: AND HE ROLLED NAZI. HE WINS THE WEEK AT THE CENTER OF THE MEDIA FIRE STORM. MANY PEOPLE WERE ANNOYED BUT NONE MORE THAN FOX NEWS.
HE COMPARED THE G.O.P. HEALTH LAW CLAIMS TO NAZI LIES.
I KNOW YOU'RE KIDDING.
NO I'M NOT.
IT IS ACCUSING THE OTHER SIDE OF BEING NAZIS IS PRETTY STRONG.
THE RHETORIC IS ABSOLUTELY OVER THE TOP.
THE MEDIA SHOULD BE ALL OVER STEVE COHEN.
IF REPUBLICANS EVER MADE SUCH A COMPARISON THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WOULD BE ALL OVER IT.
CONGRESSMAN COHEN SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF.
Jon: WOW. IF THAT GUY IS TELLING YOU, YOU SHOULD FEEL SHAME, THAT'S LIKE CHARLIE SHEEN TELLING YOU TO TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH. BUT, OF COURSE, YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON SOME DEMOCRATIC BUZZ KILL TO TWIST THINGS AROUND.
IF WE WANT TO GET INTO WHO IS HEATING THIS AND OVERHEATING THIS, I MEAN EVERY  NIGHT ON THE VERY NETWORK WE'RE ON RIGHT NOW, THE LEADING COMMENTATORS ON THIS  NETWORK USE THIS KIND OF LANGUAGE SO LET'S YOU AND I GET TOGETHER.
THAT'S NOT TRUE, RICHARD.
THAT IS TRUE. I MEAN, LISTEN, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE CAN BE THE JUDGE OF IT.
THEY CAN. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SIT AND WATCH OUR PROGRAMMING EVERY NIGHT BUT I WATCH IT EVERY DAY. YOU'RE WRONG.
Jon: I WATCH IT EVERY DAY, TOO. 12 LONG YEARS. I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.
IF YOU LOOK BACK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN GERMANY YOU CANNOT ESCAPE THE SIMILARITIES  BETWEEN WHAT HITLER AND HIS CUT THROATS DID BACK THEN AND THE HATE-FILLED BLOGS, WHAT  THEY'RE DOING NOW.
THERE IS AN OBAMA SUPPORTER, HE'S GOT THIS BOOK AND THIS VIDEO OUT THAT ARE PROPAGANDA PIECES. THEY WOULD MAKE JOSEPH GOEBBELS PROUD.
YOU HAVE A MEDIA GUESS TAP OWE AND A POLITICAL GUESS TAP OWE IN MOVE ON DOT-ORG.
THE FAR LEFT, THE ZEALOTS ARE NAZIS.
AMERICA IS REPEATING THE MISTAKES OF THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC.
I DON'T THINK ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUFFINGTON AND THE NAZIS.
I STILL DON'T THINK SHE WAS A NAZI. I SAID THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE TWO DO.
Jon: NO DIFFERENCE? COME ON. NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUFFINGTON AND THE NAZIS? . WELL, FUNNY ACCENT. ARDENT FOLLOWERS. MISLEADING BANNERS. THEY DID BOTH FIGURE OUT INGENIUS WAYS TO GET PEOPLE TO WORK FOR FREE. HMMM: YOU KNOW WHAT? FINDING PEOPLE ON FOX NEWS MAKING NAZI COMPARISONS IS TOO EASY. I ISSUE A CHALLENGE HERE. LIVE ON THIS PROGRAM TO MY STAFF. FIND SOMEONE ON FOX NEWS ALLUDING TO THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS AS USING NAZI TECHNIQUES. WITHIN 24 HOURS MEG AND KELLY SAYING IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ON THAT NETWORK. I IMAGINE THIS WILL BE DIFFICULT. I WILL GIVE MY STAFF THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES ME TO MAKE A DELICIOUS TART. IT'S ONE OF MY NAMED... I'M SORRY. YOU ALREADY FOUND IT?
I KNOW THE PROGRESSIVES ARE USING PROGRESSIVE TACTICS, NOT NAZI TACTICS. THE REAL ANSWER IS THE NAZIS WERE USING EARLY AMERICAN PROGRESSIVE TACTICS. THAT'S NOT MY OPINION. THAT'S HISTORIC FACT.
Jon: YOU KNOW, I SHOULD KNOW. I'VE BEEN DRAWING THE WRONG CONCLUSIONS FROM HISTORIC FACTS FOR YEARS. ALL RIGHT, STAFF. YOU WANT TO DANCE. YOU THINK YOU CAN FIND STUFF. LET'S DANCE. FIND ME SOMEONE ON FOX MAKING ALMOST THE EXACT SAME GOEBBELS COMPARISON TO THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS. IDEALLY SOMEONE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN. THIS IS A TOUGH ONE. I WILL GIVE YOU UNTIL I FINISH AN ORGAMI SWAN. YOU ALREADY GOT IT?
THE SOURCE LEWIS MOB DECEMBER SPIESS FOX NEWS BECAUSE WE HAVE THEIR NUMBER  AND REPORT ON THEIR ACCURATELY. THEY USE THE MOVE-ON WEBSITE TO SMEAR THIS NETWORK AND OTHERS WITH WHOM THEY DISAGREE. THEY USE TECHNIQUES PERFECTED BY THE NAZI MINISTER OF INFORMATION. THEY LIE, DISTORT, DEFAME ALL THE TIME.
Jon: OKAY, STAFF. YOU WIN THAT ROUND. FIND ME THEIR BOSS. FIND ME ROGER AILS, THE HEART AND SOUL OF FOX NEWS, THE BRAINS. THE BOSS IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE OPERATION. FIND HIM. FIND HIM EXPLICITLY. FIND HIM EXPLICITLY CALLING PEOPLE WHO AREN'T NAZIS NAZIS. YEAH. DO THAT, STAFF OF... OH, WHERE IS IT? I GUESS YOU DON'T HAVE THE VIDEOTAPE. DO YOU? HUH? I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING IN MY EAR. LOOKS MY STAFF... (LAUGHING). OH, MY GOD. IT'S GUNTHER, THE NEWS PIGEON. ROGER AILS DID IT IN A PRINT INTERVIEW SAYING OF THE NPR EXECUTIVES WHO FIRED JUAN  WILLIAMS, QUOTE, THEY ARE OF COURSE NAZIS. THEY HAVE A KIND OF NAZI ATTITUDE AND THEY ARE THE LEFT WING OF NAZISM. THAT'S CLOSE. NOW FLY, GUNTHER, BE FREE. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS IT. MY ULTIMATE CHALLENGE. MEGAN KELLY HAS NOT SEEN ANYONE EQUATING POLITICAL OPPONENTS TO NAZI OR NAZI BEHAVIOR. FIND ME, OH, STAFF OF MINE, ACTUALLY DOING IT ON MS. KELLY'S SHOW. I GIVE YOU UNTIL I FINISH THIS HOME PERM KIT TO FIND WHAT I... ROLL TAPE.
BERNIE, DID YOU WATCH IT? WHAT DID YOU THINK?
WELL, TRUE BELIEVERS ALWAYS MAKE ME A LITTLE NERVOUS. I AM NOT CALLING THESE PEOPLE NAZIS I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR BUT THEY ARE NOT  BEHAVING LIKE LIBERALS. THEY ARE BEHAVING LIKE BROWN- SHIRTED THUGS.
Jon: AHA! I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE NAZIS. I'M SAYING THEY ARE BEHAVING LIKE THE SOLDIERS HITLER USED. AHA! WELL, MS. KELLY, DON'T YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS NOW. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
