FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT RACHEL MADDOW IS JOINING THE PROGRAM THIS EVENING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT FIRST SHAME. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE ALL FELT IT AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER IN OUR LIVES WHETHER IT BE THE INTERNAL SCORN AND OPPROBRIUM WE HEAP UPON OURSELVES WHEN WE FAIL TO LIVE UP TO OUR OWN EXPECTATIONS OF CONDUCT OR THE MORE PUBLIC SHAME, THE SHARED SHAME OF SAY GETTING CAUGHT BY YOUR PARENTS MASTURBATING TO THE DINAH SHORE -- [LAUGHTER] SHE WAS SO VIVACIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'VE LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT ME TONIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE BEST PART ABOUT SHAME IS WHEN YOU GET TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE FEEL IT.
JOHN TRAVOLTA IS EXPLAINING HIS TOTAL BUTCHERING OF IDINA MENZEL'S NAME AT THE OSCARS.
THE TWITTERVERSE EXPLODED AFTER JOHN TRAVOLTA BOTCHED THE BROADWAY STAR'S NAME
HIS VERY VIRAL OSCAR NIGHT CLUB.
KIND OF BUTCHERED HER NAME.
YOU'VE GOT TWO LINES TO MEMORIZE. YOU ARE AN ACTOR HOW HARD IS IT?
Jon: THAT MONSTER. [ LAUGHTER ] MISPRONOUNCING HER NAME. [LAUGHTER] HOW WILL HE EVER LIVE DOWN AN EMBARRASSMENT LIKE THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEANT THE MISPRONUNCIATION. NO I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT -- NO WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT SHAME, I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT TRAVOLTA I WAS TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT TRULY SHAMEFUL BEHAVIOR THAT FOR SOME REASON DID NOT EXPLODE THE TWITTER VERSE.
A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE EXPANDED HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION FOR VETERANS GETTING REJECTED IN THE SENATE. A LACK OF SUPPORT FROM REPUBLICANS DOOMED THIS BILL.
Jon: WHAT? AUDIENCE REACTS] THE REPUBLICANS? SORRY YOU KNOW WHAT. THE ACTING. HMM. LET ME JUST FOCUS. I DIDN'T QUITE CONVEY AS AN ACTOR JUST HOW SHOCKED I AM THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE THE ONES WHO DIDN'T SUPPORT THE BILL SUPPORTING THE VETERANS, SO LET ME JUST TRY THIS AGAIN AND -- OKAY. [LAUGHTER] NO! THE REPUBLICANS KILLED A BILL? REPUBLICANS? [LAUGHTER] DISAPPOINTED! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT I REALIZED? I CAN ONLY DO THIS FOR ABOUT FOUR SECONDS AND THEN GRAVITY, GRAVITY HAS BECOME EXERCISE FOR ME. [ LAUGHTER ] WOW. [ LAUGHTER ] AND BREATHE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, OBVIOUSLY THE FAILURE OF THIS BILL TO HELP OUR VETERANS DID GET SOME ATTENTION AND SOME SHAMING. YOUR HAYES, YOUR CUOMO MADE A POINT OF DISCUSSING THIS TRAVESTY BUT THE OUTCRY DISPARITY BETWEEN THE TRAVOLTA NAME FLUB SHAMING AND THE RELATIVE LACK OF SHAMING AIMED AT REPUBLICAN SENATORS (bleep) OVER VETERANS SHOWS I THINK A REAL PROBLEM WITH OUR NATION'S SHAME-O-METER. THERE'S THE PROBLEM THERE. IT'S OUT OF WHACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU HAVE YOUR DIC PIC. HERE IS THE PROBLEM. YOU HAVE YOUR PICK PIC TWEETS WHERE SHAFTING VETERANS SHOULD BE. YOU HAVE TO FLIP THOSE. ALL THE ELEMENTS FOR A GOOD SHAMING ARE IN PLACE WITH THIS VETERANS BILL. HYPOCRITICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT.
THEY SAID $24 BILLION PRICE TAG WOULD BUST THE BUDGET.
IT'S NOT PAID FOR IN ANY WAY IT'S ALL BORROWED MONEY.
IF THE V.A. IS FAILING TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS TO VETERANS IS IT WISE TO EXTEND ITS MISSION FURTHER? OF COURSE NOT.
Jon: THE V.A. IS WASTEFUL OFTEN INEFFECTIVE. THIS IS TRUE. ADDS TO THE DEBT FOR THIS BILL. APPARENTLY THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THESE SENATORS DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT IN 2008 WHEN THEY VOTED TO CONTINUE FUNDING THE IRAQ WAR DESPITE THE PENTAGON BEING UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR A MISSING  $15 BILLION WORTH OF (bleep) WE BOUGHT. BUT THAT WAS DIFFERENT. WHEN YOU SPEND MONEY AND YOU'RE AWAY FROM HOME YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SPLURGE. YOU ARE ON A WAR-CATION. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE GOT VETERANS CONDEMNING THIS VOTE.
THE AMERICAN LEGION SAYING THERE WAS A RIGHT WAY TO VOTE AND A WRONG WAY TO VOTE TODAY. 41 SENATOR CHOSE THE WRONG WAY TODAY. INEXCUSABLE. I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE WHO VOTED NO TODAY COULD LOOK A VETERAN IN THE EYE AND JUSTIFY THAT VOTE.
Jon: THE TRICK IS THEY DON'T LOOK THEM IN THE EYE. THEY LOOK RIGHT HERE. IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO (bleep) PEOPLE OVER WHEN YOU JUST LOOK AT THE FOREHEAD. WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO SHAME THESE SENATORS? CAN I GET A NUN OUT HERE? LET'S GET A NUN OUT HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE WE GO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GIVE THEM -- RIGHT THERE. THERE YOU GO. IS THAT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE IS THAT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR YOU TO ACT RESPONSIBLY? DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT CAN SAVE THIS SENATORS?
I HAVE IN MY BILL A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT'S COSPONSORED BY 59 SENATORS, BIPARTISAN.
Jon: NOW YOU ARE TALKING, SISTER, YOU CAN GO. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING 59 SENATORS BIPARTISAN YOU ATTACHED AN AMENDMENT TO THE VETERANS BILL THAT WOULD FIX ANY ISSUE THAT YOU HAD WITH IT AND YOU HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR IT. WHAT IS IT?
THE IRAN SANCTIONS BILL.
Jon: MOTHER (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] IRAN SANCTIONS. YOU ARE PUTTING IN IRAN SANCTIONS AMENDMENT ON THE VETERANS BENEFITS (bleep) SISTER, COME BACK IN HERE. COME BACK HERE IN. COME BACK HERE IN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, YOU'VE DONE IT NOW WHO WANTS TO TASTE SOME OF THESE NUN-CHUCKS.
Jon: IT'S INTERESTING IN JAPAN IT'S REFERRED TO AS NUNCAHKU. OK NUN CHUCKS IT IS. LET'S GO OVER HERE. HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY ATTACHING THE IRAN SANCTIONS BILL TO THE VETERANS BENEFITS BILL?
IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET THIS TO THE FLOOR. BECAUSE WE'RE DENIED ANY OTHER ATTEMPT TO DO IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: BOO BOO BOO YOU ARE RIGHT. YOU ARE THE VICTIM HERE. YOU'VE BEEN DENIED SOMETHING YOU NEED BY AN IMPERSONAL GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY, HOW CAN ANYONE KNOW THE ANGUISH THAT YOU MUST FEEL? BUT THAT WASN'T THE WORST EXPLANATION OF WHY THE IRAN SANCTIONS BILL IS A RELEVANT ADD ON TO THE VETERANS BILL THIS WAS THE WORST.
IF THE NEGOTIATIONS FAIL AS I TRAGICALLY HAVE TO TELL YOU THEY ARE DESTINED TO FAIL AND IRAN RETAINS THE ENRICHMENT CAPABILITY, I WOULD ARGUE TO YOU THAT IT ACTUALLY IS RELEVANT BECAUSE IT'S OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM THAT WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO WHEN THIS THING ENDS UP THE WAY I KNOW IT WILL AND ASK THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM.
Jon: YOU GET IT? WE CAN'T AFFORD TO PROPERLY TAKE CARE OF OUR EXISTING VETERANS WHEN WE KNOW HOW MANY MORE VETERANS WE'RE ABOUT TO CREATE WITH OUR INEVITABLE WAR WITH IRAN. IT'S BAD ECONOMICS. THAT'S GOTTA BE THE HIGHEST RATING ON THE SHAME-O-METER
KANSAS SENTAOR JERRY MORAN HAS BLOCKED A LONG DELAYED FLOOR DEBATE ON THE SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY ISSUE INSISTING IT BE LINKED TO SANCTIONS IN IRAN.
Jon: I STAND CORRECTED APPARENTLY THE SHAME-O-METER GOES TO 11. WHY DO THESE SENATORS GET TO STAY IN OFFICE? MAYBE IF WE FRAME THEIR ACTIONS IN WAYS THAT WE KNOW GENERATE REAL OUTRAGE IN AMERICA, BY PRIORITIZING SANCTIONS IN IRAN OVER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR EXISTING VETERANS I THINK THE SENATORS MAY HAVE JUST TWEETED OUT A PICTURE OF THEIR ENORMOUS BALLS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW CAN WE -- [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW CAN WE KICK THEM OUT? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
