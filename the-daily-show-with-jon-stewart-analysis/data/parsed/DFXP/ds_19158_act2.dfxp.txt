Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW IT'S BEEN A WHILE, BEEN A WHILE SINCE WE CHECKED IN WITH WALL STREET BUT THAT ENDS RIGHT NOW.
CHINESE E-COMMERCE POWERHOUSE ALIBABA IS SET TO MAKE A HISTORIC DEBUT ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.
ONE FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS.
INVESTORS ARE SALIVATING.
I SAW GERALDO IN THE HALLWAY, HE SAID, SHOULD I BUY? SHOULD I BUY?
OH NO.
Jon: AND I WAS LIKE YEAH, YOU SHOULD BUY A SHIRT. I MEAN COME ON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE? YOU'RE AT THE OFFICE. YEAH, THAT'S ROUGH, I KNOW. YOU'RE TRYING TO GO TO BED, I APOLOGIZE. WELL THIS ALIBABA OPERATION SOUNDS EXCITING. OBVIOUSLY, CHINA'S ECONOMY IS BOOMING, I GUESS IT LEAVES AMERICANS WITH JUST ONE QUESTION, WHAT IS ALIBABA?
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMPARISONS BETWEEN ALIBABA AND AMAZON. IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME. ALIBABA DOESN'T SELL THINGS, IT CONNECTS BUYERS AND SELLERS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: CONNECTS BUYERS AND SELLERS? SO IT'S CRAIGSLIST WITH BETTER GRAPHICS, IS THAT WHAT IT IS? DO YOU LIKE AMAZON BUT ARE SICK OF ITS RELIABILITY? THE SENSE THAT AT ANY MOMENT YOU COULD I DON'T KNOW ORDER THE NEW DAN BROWN NOVEL BUT INSTEAD BE SENT A BOX OF DISCONTINUED CHINESE GOPHER ENEMAS? TRY ALIBABA. THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE TO IT THAN THAT.
REALLY, IT'S LIKE 12 COMPANIES. IT'S THE EBAY AND AMAZON, AND PAYPAL IS PRETTY EASY, BUT IT'S A NETFLIX, IT'S A GROUPON.
Jon: IT IS A TINDER, IT'S A TUMBLR, IT'S GRINDR! IT'S A CRONUT STUFFED INSIDE A P'ZONE AND LOVINGLY FED TO A JACKALOPE. IT IS A BUSINESS THAT MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. WHO CARES WHAT IT IS, JUST TELL US, IS THERE GOLD IN THEM THERE HILLS?
ALIBABA'S PROFIT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER JUMPED SOME 179% TO $2 BILLION. REVENUE INCREASED BY 46%, DOUBLE THAT OF U.S. ONLINE RETAILER AMAZON. THOSE STATS ARE ENOUGH TO PUT EVEN THE MOST CONFIDENT C.E.O.s ON EDGE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: CNN, DID YOU JUST MAKE A JOKE ABOUT THE AMAZON LOGO LOSING ITS BONER? IS THAT WHAT THAT IS? AND DON'T SAY IT WAS JUST A SMILE TURN TURNING IN A FROWN, NOT WITH THE SLIDE WHISTLE. BECAUSE THE SLIDE WHISTLE OF COURSE IS AN INSTRUMENT INVENTED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INDICATING THE LOSS OF ONE'S BONER. I BELIEVE IT WAS FIRST USED BY MOZART THAT TIME HE-- YES, I BELIEVE THAT HE WAS TRYING TO (BLEEP) BLOCK SALIERI. (LAUGHTER) SO LAST QUARTER ALONE ALIBABA HAD $2 BILLION IN PROFIT, WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE BEST THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD WITH NO DOWNSIDE AT ALL. I'M JUST GOING TO BUY ME SOME SHARES IN ALIBABA.
YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY BUY SHARES IN ALIBABA.
Jon: YEAH HOLD ON ONE SECOND. SORRY?
SHAREHOLDERS AREN'T BUYING ACTUAL SHARES OF ALIBABA WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN CHINA. THEY'RE BUYING SHARES IN ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LIMITED, INCORPORATED IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO I PAY FOR A SHARE OF SOMETHING ON AN ISLAND AND I DON'T OWN IT? YOU ARE SELLING US A TIME-SHARE? IS THAT WHAT THIS IS? A TIMESHARE IN A COMPANY? WITHOUT GIVING US A FREE VACATION TO SIT THROUGH YOUR PITCH. AND ANOTHER THING, ALIBABA IS A CHINESE COMPANY, WHY IS IT DOING ITS STOCK OFFERING HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
DIDN'T LIST IN HONG KONG BECAUSE FOR HONG KONG YOU NEED CERTAIN TYPES OF MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES THAT WEREN'T GONNA BE ALLOWED BASED UPON THEIR LISTING REQUIREMENTS SO THAT IS WHY THEY ARE TAKING THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD TO THE U.S..
Jon: I SEE. COMPANIES TRADING IN THE U.S. TO ESCAPE MORE STRINGENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT OF CHINA, CHINA. THE COMPANY WHOSE MOTTO IS HEY, LET'S PUT LEAD PAINT IN EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE FLAG. CHINA. THIS IS STARTING TO SOUND SHADY. I'M SITTING THIS ONE OUT.
SHARES SOARED, NEARLY $30 ABOVE THE IPO PRICE.
IT'S OPENING $228 BILLION VALUE MADE IT BIGGER THAN COCA-COLA, JPMORGAN CHASE.  BIGGER THAN FACEBOOK.
Jon: SON OF A -- WHY DID I HANG UP THE PHONE? GOD, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, WITH ALIBABA WE HAVE AN INTERNET START-UP THAT MAKES NO TANGIBLE PRODUCT WITH A HUGELY INFLATED IPO THAT WAS IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY DUE TO A CAYMAN ISLAND LOOPHOLE THAT AVOIDS REGULATIONS IN THAT COMPANY'S HOME COUNTRY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS? THE COMMUNISTS JUST BEAT US AT CAPITALISM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
