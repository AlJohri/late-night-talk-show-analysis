FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, MY GUEST TONIGHT, MARK FAINARU-WADA, HE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK THAT HAS ROCKED THE NFL ABOUT CONCUSSIONS, WROTE IT WITH HIS BROTHER, FABULOUS BOOK, HAPPY HALLOWEEN. HEALTHCARE.GOV IS ONE MONTH OLD, AND LIKE MOST ONE MONTH OLDS, IT IS JUST LYING THERE POOPING ITS PANTS AND ANGERING ANYONE  WHO IT IS NOT RELATED TO. WELL, YESTERDAY THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE HELD THE MUCH ANTICIPATED HEARING, WITH KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, LET'S SEE HER TRY TO WIGGLE OUT OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THIS MESS.
LET ME SAY DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICANS YOU DESERVE BETTER. I APOLOGIZE. I AM ACCOUNTABLE TO YOU FOR FIXING THESE PROBLEMS.
Stewart: THAT WAS WEIRD. I WONDER IF HER APOLOGY WILL IN ANY WAY AFFECT ANY CERTAIN GRANDSTANDING TYPE CONGRESS PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE PLANNED ON SHAMING HER INTO APOLOGIZING WITH SOME KIND OF WEIRD PROP OR SOMETHING.
I CAME WITH A QUOTE FROM AMERICAN ICON. HOLD UP A POSTER THAT SAYS IF YOU ARE HAVING A PROBLEM, IT IS OUR PROBLEM. AND I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOU EMBRACE THIS PHILOSOPHY TO YOUR ACTIONS TODAY.
Stewart: NOW, I AM REALLY GLAD YOU EMBRACE THIS PHILOSOPHY EVEN THOUGH I WAITED ALL NIGHT AT KINKOS AND I PAID PRETTY GOOD MONEY FOR THIS SIGN, AND JUST A HEADS-UP, IF YOU, I GOT THIS BIG SIGN AND IT COST A LOT OF MONEY, THAT'S ALL. I FELT LIKE A (BLEEP) DRIVING IT ON TOP OF MY CAR.
POOR GUY. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU SPENT ALL NIGHT PREPARING (BLEEP) SANDWICH FOR YOUR ENEMIES TO EAT ONLY TO HAVE THEM SIT DOWN AND UNWRAP THEIR OWN (BLEEP) SANDWICH. TO EAT IN FRONT OF YOU. SO THIS IS CONGRESS, WELL THAT GUY IS STANDING WAS NOT THAT GRAND, I AM SURE WHERE THAT CAME FROM.
IS THERE ANY PENALTY TO QSSI OR CGI FOR NOT DELIVERING ON WHAT THEY PROMISED?
USERS WHO TRIED TO SIGN UP AND WERE DISCOURAGED BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO GET THOSE FOLKS TO COME BACK?
DID THE CONTRACTORS DELIVER THE SYSTEM THAT YOU CONTRACTED THEM TO BUILD?
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT TWO WEEKS WAS ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLETE TESTING OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM?
Stewart: WHAT A BUNCH OF -- SURPRISINGLY RELEVANT QUESTIONS. THOSE QUESTIONS WERE ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. YOU WOULD ALMOST THINK THEY WERE AT THIS HEARING TO HEAR. ARE WE REALLY GOING TO SPEND THREE HOURS OF HAVING PRODUCTIVE DISCOURSE?
THERE IS A FAMOUS MOVIE CALLED "THE WIZARD OF OZ" --
Stewart: WHOA!  DO GO ON.
IN "THE WIZARD OF OZ" THERE IS A GREAT LINE, DOROTHY, AT SOME POINT IN THE MOVIE TURNS TO HER LITTLE DOG TOTO AND SAYS, TOTO, WE ARE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE. WELL, MADAM SECRETARY, WHILE YOU ARE FROM KANSAS, WE ARE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE.
Stewart: LET ME JUST STOP YOU RIGHT THERE. THE DOG'S NAME IS TOTO. NOT TOOOTOOO.
THE DEMOCRATS WHEN THEY CAME UP WITH A LITTLE MORE ON POINT.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KEEPS COMING UP IN THIS HEARING BECAUSE YOU ARE FROM KANSAS IS REFERENCES TO THE WIZARD OF OZ.
Stewart: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
AND PEOPLE WENT TO SEE THE WIZARD BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS HE DID. AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS DOING A LOT OF GREAT THINGS IN IOWA.
Stewart: YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO USE THE WIZARD TO DEFEND YOUR PROGRAM TO SAY HOW GREAT IT IS?  DID YOU WATCH THE MOVIE?  THE WIZARD IS A  CHARLATAN HE IS A TWO BIT HUCKSTER WHO NEVER GAVE PEOPLE ANYTHING THEY DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE .. SO FOR THE MOST PART THE HEARING WAS SUBSTANTIVE WITH A SMATTERING OF SILLY, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE WAS NOBODY THERE JUST TO FILL THE NEXT CAMPAIGN AD LIKE CORY GARDNER WHO SPENT THE FIRST TWO HOURS OF THE HEARING DRINKING RED BULL AND SNORTING COFFEE GROUNDS TO WAIT HIS TURN.
WHY WON'T YOU GO INTO THE EXCHANGE, YOU ARE PART OF THIS LAW AND IN CHARGE OF THIS LAW SHOULD YOU BE ANY DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER AMERICANS OUT THERE WHO ARE LOSING THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE?
I AM PART OF THE 95 PERCENT WITH AFFORDABLE, AVAILABLE HEALTHCARE IF I HAVE AFFORDABLE WORK COVERAGE IN MY WORKPLACE I AM NOT ELIGIBLE TO GO INTO THE MARKETPLACE.
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE JUST LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ENTER THE EXCHANGE AND AGREE TO FIND A WAY TO DO THAT. I DON'T CARE.
IT IS ILLEGAL.
Stewart: DID YOU HEAR HER?  IT IS ILLEGAL. DOESN'T STOP HIM. WELL, BREAK THE LAW!  I ENCOURAGE YOU TO JOIN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO BREAK THE LAW EVERY DAY. THAT WAS SOME IMPRESSIVE GRANDSTANDING POPULIST NONSENSE, YOUNG MAN, DELIVERED WITH PASSION, BUT LET THIS MISSOURI CONGRESSMAN TELL YOU HOW NOT TO TAKE NO HYPOTHETICALS FOR AN ANSWER.
IF IT IS POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GO INTO THE EXCHANGE, LIKE ALL OF THESE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THAT ARE GOING TO THE EXCHANGES, WILL YOU COMMIT TO FOREGO YOUR GOVERNMENT INSURANCE PLAN YOU ARE ON NOW AND JOIN US IN THE POOL?
SIR, THE WAY THE LAW IS WRITTEN --
IT IS A YES OR NO. LET'S SAY YOU ARE WRONG ON THAT. YES OR NO, IF YOU ARE WRONG --
I DON'T WANT TO --
Stewart: MADAM SECRETARY, AR, AR, A R, THE LET'S SAY HYPOTHETICALLY, LET'S SAY THE SOUTH WON THE WAR AND YOU, YOU YOURSELF HAVE A TERRIBLE NUT ALLERGY WOULD YOU JOIN?
LET ME TRY THIS. ZERO OH, LET ME FINISH!  IF AMERICANS SPOKE FRENCH AND, WOULD YOU THEN SIGN UP FOR OBAMACARE?  WOULD YOU DO THAT?
WOULD YOU DO THAT?
MADAM, MADAM!  LISTEN TO ME!  IF I WAS STORING FISH IN MY NECK RIGHT NOW AS I WERE SPEAKING, SO THAT I COULD DIGEST THEM LATER [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: WOULD YOU DO IT?  MADAM SECRETARY, I YIELD MY TIME. OF COURSE THE MASTER OF ANTI-OBAMACARE GRANDSTANDING, TENNESSEE CONGRESSMAN MARCIA BLACKBURN NO MATTER HOW (BLEEP) AN INSURANCE PLAN IS, SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT.
HOW WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MARK & LUCINDA, THEY LIKED THE PLAN, IT WAS AFFORDABLE AND LIKED IT BUT IT IS BEING TERMINATED AND NOW THEY DO NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE?
I WILL REMIND YOU, SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DRIVE A FORD, NOT A FERRARI AND SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DRINK OUT OF A RED SOLO CUP AND NOT A CRYSTAL STEM, YOU ARE TAKING AWAY THEIR CHOICE.
Stewart: I BELIEVE IN CHOICE EXCEPT IN MARRIAGE AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS BUT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW, NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, HOLD ON. LET ME JUST -- REALLY, I ACTUALLY ONLY BELIEVE IN CUP OR CAR CHOICE, THAT'S IT. IT IS JUST THOSE TWO. BUT, IT IS HARDLY SURPRISING THAT BLACKBURN CAME TO THE HEARING WITH A WITTY LINE PREPARED LIKE THAT. SHE HAS BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS HEARING FOR A WHILE.
THE MORE WE HEARD TODAY, THE MORE QUESTIONS WE HAD, SO WE WILL BE READY FOR SECRETARY SEBELIUS WHEN SHE COMES BEFORE US NEXT WEEK.
WE WANT HER TO TALK WITH US BEFORE SHE IS OUT THE DOOR. WE ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.
SHE HAS GOT TIME FOR JON STEWART AND "THE DAILY SHOW" BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO COME TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE TASKED WITH OVERSEEING THIS.
Stewart: (BLEEP) TO DO WITH THIS?  WHAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: I AM JUST TRYING TO -- HUH?  KATHLEEN SEBELIUS CHOSE TO COME HERE, IT WAS HER CHOICE. SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO GO BEFORE CONGRESS AND DRINK OUT OF A RED SOLO -- FREEDOM HATER!  SEEMS LIKE BLACKBURN HAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR SEBELIUS, HOPEFULLY THREE HOURS WILL BE ENOUGH TIME. THE CONGRESSWOMAN TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION SHE SO DESPERATELY -- WAIT, SHE IS GETTING UP. THAT IS WEIRD. 10:21 SHE IS GETTING UP AND IS SHE LEAVING?  OH, MY GOD SHE IS WALKING OUT OF THE ROOM, IS SHE GOING BACK TO RESEARCH SOME INSURANCE FACTS PERHAPS TO REFILL HER RED SOLO CUP?  JOINING US NOW IS REPRESENTATIVE MARCIA BLACKBURN WHO WAS IN THE HEARING, ASKED SOME TERRIFIC QUESTIONS. SHE JOINS US NOW FROM OUR CAMERA RIGHT THERE ON CAPITOL HILL.
Stewart: NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL, STEWART, HAPPY TO BE HERE.
YOU ARE NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.
WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO TELL THE TINY AMOUNT OF AMERICANS WHO WATCH FOX BUSINESS NETWORK IT COULDN'T WAIT UNTIL THE HEARING YOU DEMANDED WAS OVER?
SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE SIPPING CHARDONNAY FROM A CRYSTAL STEM, THEY WANT BEER FROM A RED SOLO CUP, YOU KNOW. IT IS A CHOICE.
Stewart: RED SOLO CUP!  WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
