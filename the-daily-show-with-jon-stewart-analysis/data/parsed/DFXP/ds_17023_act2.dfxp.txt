( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  AS YOU KNOW, TWO NIGHT AGO, THE POWERS THAT BE IN NEW YORK CITY ANSWERED THE  PEOPLE'S CALL AND RECLAIMED ZUCOTTI PARK IN LOWER MANHATTAN. AKA, THE PARK NO ONE-- EVEN THOSE OF US WHO LIVE ACROSS THE STREET FROM IT-- HAD HEARD OF  UNTIL THE OCCUPY WALL STREET MOVEMENT. APPARENTLY, IT'S A PARK IN LOWER MANHATTAN WHERE PEOPLE FROM WALL  STREET WOULD GO TO SMOKE AROUND NOON. ( LAUGHTER ) ANYWAY, WE GOT IT BACK! AS FOR THE MOVEMENT, PROTESTERS HAVE VOWED TO RETAKE THE PARK, IF ONLY TO ERECT A MONUMENT TO WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE ORIGINAL OCCUPIERS' BIGGEST CHALLENGE. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY TRULY WERE THE LEAST TOILETED GENERATION. BUT AS OUR OWN SAMANTHA BEE REPORTS FROM A VISIT TO ZUCOTTI PARK, ON THE OCCUPATION'S FINAL  DAY, THE MOVEMENT WAS ALREADY BEING THREATENED BY FORCES EVEN MORE POWERFUL THAN THE CITY OF  NEW YORK. THE PROSPECT OF BECOMING THE VERY THING THAT THEY WERE FIGHTING AGAINST.
Reporter: OCCUPY WALL STREET. IT WAS BORN OUT OF THE LOFTIEST OF AMBITIONS.
WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD A NEW SOCIETY.
ALL EQUAL AND CIVILIZED WITH EACH OTHER.
AN OPEN, HORIZONTAL, LEADERLESS PROCESS.
Reporter: AND TWO NIGHTS AGO, THE OCCUPATION ENDED. BUT MAYBE IT WAS A GOOD THING. AS IT DRAGGED ON THE MOVEMENT HAD BEEN IN DANGER OF BECOMING THE VERY THING IT WAS FIGHTING AGAINST.
THE MORE PEOPLE THAT CAME, THE MORE PEOPLE KIND OF, LIKE, SEG GAILED INTO, LIKE, THEIR OWN LITTLE GROUPS. IT SPLIT IN HALF.
UP THERE IS, LIKE, "WHERE THE COLLEGE HIPSTERS WHO LIVE IN BROOKLYN IF. AND TRY TO RULE THE PARK FROM, YOU KNOW. AND DOWN HERE IT'S MORE OF THE POOR PEOPLE'S ENCAMPMENT AND  IT'S KIND OF CONTENTIOUS.
Reporter: OCCUPY WALL STREET WAS DIVIDED BY CLASS. ON THE ONE SIDE THE ELITE WITH THEIR LIBRARY, APPLE POP-UP STORE, AND BIKE-POWERED ESTRESSO MACHINE. ON THE OTHER, THE DOWN WARDLY MOBILE WITH THEIR DRUM CIRCLES.
THERE'S THE GHETTO.
Reporter: WHAT DO YOU CALL UP TOP?
THAT'S MORE THE ARISTOCRATIC SIDE, LIKE THE UPPER EAST SIDE.
YOU HAVE THE WEST ENDERS AND EAST ENDERRERS. THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS WITHOUT THE GENERAL CONSENSUS OF EVERYBODY IN THE PARK.
Reporter: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU'VE BEEN HERE EIGHT WEEKS AND YOU ALREADY HAVE A GHETTO?
WELL, I MEAN --
Reporter: I HEADED UPTOWN TO SEE HOW THE UPPER CRUST FELT LIVING NEXT TO THE GHETTO PEOPLE. WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH DOWN THERE?
UHM, THEY'RE ALSO MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY.
I THINK IN ANY COMMUNITY, WHETHER IT BE CITY, WHETHER IT BE ZUCOTTI PARK, YOU HAVE AREAS THAT ARE A LITTLE QUIET EAREAS  THAT ARE A LITTLE LOUDER.
Reporter: OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. YOU'RE BROGUE UP LIKE A HEMEIUM BALLOON YOU'RE TRYING SO HARD NOT TO SAY IT.
AREAS OF OUR PARK ARE INHABITED BY PERHAPS YOUNGER, MORE BOISTEROUS, ENERGETIC PEOPLE.
Reporter: IS THERE A COURSE IN CONDESCENSION THAT EVERYONE IS TAKING HERE? HAS A GOOD IDEA EVER COME OUT OF THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE PARK?
I THINK THEY DO, ON OCCASION, WITHOUT THEM EVEN KNOWING HOW GOOD THEIR IDEAS ARE, SOMETIMES THEY COME UP WITH GOOD IDEAS.
Reporter: OKAY, OKAY, THAT'S INTERESTING. YOU CAN GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF THAT.
THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE HARD.
Reporter: I HEADED BACK DOWNTOWN TO SEE HOW THE MOOCHER CLASS DEFENDED ITSELF. HOW MANY HOURS OF WORK DID YOU PUT IN TODAY?
HOURS OF WORK I PUT IN TODAY?
Reporter: YE.
I'M NOT SURE YET.
Reporter: HAVE YOU PUT IN ANY HOURS OF WORK TODAY?
I DON'T KEEP TRACK OF TIME HERE.
Reporter: WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE 99% ARE THOSE IVY LEAGUE ( BLEEP ) UPTOWN?
I WOULD SAY 15.
Reporter: 15% OF THE PARK?
YEAH.
WHEN EVERYTHING COMES DOWN AND IT GETS SCARY AND EVERYBODY  DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY CALL ON US. "OH, COULD YOU HELP US OUT?"
Reporter: PERHAPS THE GHETTO PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW HARD THE 15% OF THE 99% WAS  WORKING FOR THEM.
I'M HERE FIGHTING FOR A SOCIETY WHERE EVERYONE HAS O.K. CESS TO THE GOODS OF LIFE.
Reporter: WOULD YOU SHARE YOUR iPAD 2 WITH ONE OF THOSE SHIFTLESS HOBOZE DOWN IN BUNK TOWN?
NO, BUT I THINK WE SHOULD LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND GOODS.
Reporter: IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT SHARING. IT'S ABOUT EVERYBODY HAVING AN iPAD 2.
OR EVERYBODY HAVING ACCESS TO THE MATERIAL WEALTH OF LIFE.
Reporter: EXCEPT FOR YOURS.
THIS IS A PERSONAL MEGS. I'M MORE AGAINST PRIVATE PROPERTY, NOT PERSONAL PROPERTY.
Reporter: CLEARLY IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS IN THIS CONTENTIOUS ENVIRONMENT. FORTUNATELY, THEY HAD A SOLUTION.
THIS IS THE SPACE WHERE OUR VARIOUS COMMITTEES AND ACTION GROUPS MEET TO DISCUSS THE  THINGS THEY'RE WORKING ON AND DEVELOP PROPOSALS FOR THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
Reporter: WHERE ARE WE?
60 WALL STREET. THE LOBBY OF THE DEUTSCHE BANK BILLION.
Reporter: HOLY ( BLEEP ). I'M SORRY, THE BIG DECISIONS OF OCCUPY WALL STREET ARE BEING MADE IN THE ATRIUM OF THE  DEUTSCHE BANK BUILDING?
THAT'S CORRECT.
Reporter: I'M SORRY, IS MY NOSE BLEEDING?
NO.
Reporter: BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE AN ANEURYSM EXPLODED IN MY HEAD. HERE DECISIONS COULD BE MADE QUIETLY AND OUT OF SIGHT OF THE MASSES. ANOTHER DOES THE DRUM CIRCLE KNOW WE'RE ALL HERE RIGHT NOW? IN ANY CASE, BOTH THE UPDOWN ELITIST AND THE DOWNTOWN POOREST CAN AGREE-- THE OCCUPATION  DEVELOPED TOO EARLY. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO DEVELOP A MIDDLE CLASS FOR THIS NEW SOCIETY TO CRUSH.
