(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. HOLD ON TIGHT. WHAT FOLLOWS IS ONE OF THE MOST  IMPORTANT STORIES WE'VE EVER  COVERED EVER. JASON JONES REPORTS.
AMERICA HAS ALWAYS HAD AN  OBSESSION WITH THE WILD WEST. BUT HERE IN FRESNO, A MODERN DAY  JESSE JAMES IS TEARING THIS ONCE  SLEEPY COMMUNITY APART. AND THIS PEACEFUL HAMLET OF  FAMILY FARMS PROVIDED THE  PERFECT COVER FOR A TRAFFICKING RING SO BIG THAT THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT HIRED A PRIVATE  SECURITY FIRM TO BRING IT DOWN.
OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO  INVESTIGATE THE PRODUCT THAT WAS  BEING PROCESSED AT MR. HORN'S  PLANT.
OUR MAIN BASE WAS EITHER HERE  AT THIS CORNER OR NORTH OF HI  PLANT.
WE HAD SIX TO EIGHT AGENTS  FROM SUNUP TO SUNDOWN.
WELL, HE CALLED ME A FAT ASS.
SEEMS A LITTLE DANGEROUS. WHAT KIND OF PRODUCT ARE WE  TALKING ABOUT? COKE? HEROINE?
RAISINS.
THAT'S CODE FOR WHAT?
RAISINS.
HE'S A RAISIN OUTLAW. ♪ ♪  ♪ ♪
THIS IS RAISIN OUTLAW MARVIN  HORNE WHO IS ACTUALLY ACCUSED OF  DEFRAUDING THE GOVERNMENT OF DRIED FRUIT BECAUSE HE REFUSED  TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNITED  STATES NATIONAL RAISIN RESERVE-- WHICH APPARENTLY IS A REAL THING  THAT THE GOVERNMENT USES TO HELP  REGULATE THE COST OF RAISINS.
MY BIGGEST ISSUE WAS THE  RAISIN ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE  NOW IS THEY CONFISCATE A PORTION OF MY CROP AND DON'T PAY ME FOR  IT.
THAT JUST DEFIES ALL THOUGHT  OR RAISINS. (LAUGHTER)
I STARTED STACKING MY RAISINS  UP, I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT TO  THEM ANYMORE.
AND WHAT'S YOUR RAISIN FOR  DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING? (LAUGHTER)
MY WHOLE GOAL ALWAYS WAS TO  PACK MY OWN RAISINS AND SELL  THEM.
SO ESSENTIALLY, THAT IS YOUR  RAISON D'ETRE?
OKAY, JASON, I SEE YOU'RE  TRYING TO BE A LITTLE FUNNY HERE  BUT THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THERE IS NO JOKE WHEN SOMEBODY  COMES AND TAKES YOUR FARM AWAY  FROM YOU. THAT'S NO JOKE.
I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. I WAS BEING UNRAISINNABLE. (LAUGHTER)  I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER,  THE BOSS DOESN'T COME BACK FOR  ANOTHER WEEK, I'M PHONING IN A FIELD PIECE ABOUT (BLEEP)ING  RAISINS. I WOULD HAVE AGREED WITH YOU  UNTIL I HEARD THIS. HOW MUCH DO YOU OWE THEM NOW?
APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION.
I'M SORRY? $11 .5 MILLION?
YES.
THAT MAY SOUND RIDICULOUS. THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS. SO I HIGH HIRED A HIGHLY TRAINED  RAISIN SNIFFING COMPANION TO  HELP ME TRACK DOWN THE RAISIN ADMINISTRATIVE COUNCIL.
OUR JOB IS TO MEASURE AND BE  AWARE OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND  PICTURE OF CALIFORNIA RAISINS AND TO REGULATE THAT VOLUME BY  PERHAPS SETTING SOME ASIDE ON  THE SIDELINES FOR A WHILE.
I'M NO RAISIN EXPERT, BUT  THIS KIND OF SOUND LIKE TWO  SCOOPS OF BULL (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  AND JUST WHEN I THOUGHT THIS  STORY COULDN'T GET STUPIDER, I  HEARD THIS.
SUN VALLEY RAISIN GROWERS  TOOK THEIR BATTLE WITH THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT.
SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME  SCALIA, ROBERTS, SOTOMAYOR, SAT  THERE AND LISTENED TO ORAL ARGUMENTS OVER RAISINS?
YES. AND THEY HAD SOME VERY  PENETRATING QUESTIONS.
AS THE SUPREME COURT  TRANSCRIPT SHOWS, THE COURT MAY  HAVE BEEN THE ONLY ONE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.
CASE 12-123, HORNE V. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
WHAT WAS THE INTEREST THAT  THEY'RE CLAIMING WAS TAKEN BY  THE GOVERNMENT?
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY  LANDMARK CASES WE STILL HAVE TO  RULE ON?
BEING PART RAISIN, I FEEL I  MUST RECUSE MYSELF.
MAY I PLEASE HAVE A RAISIN.
GET THESE RAISINS OUT OF MY  (BLEEP)ING COURT!
IN THE END THE JUSTICES RULED  UNANIMOUSLY THAT IT WASN'T WORTH  THEIR TIME TO ISSUE A RULING. BUT MARVIN HORNE VOWS TO FIGHT  ON.
I DECLARED WAR ON THE  U.S.D.A. I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU MY  RAISINS ANYMORE.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE RAISIN A  LITTLE HELL. (LAUGHTER)  BE CAREFUL, MARVIN, THE RAISIN  COUNCIL IS A RUTHLESS  ORGANIZATION. YOU REMEMBER THESE LOVABLE GUYS? EVER WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO  THEM?
WELL, WE USED THEM ABOUT 25  YEARS AGO AND USED THEM UNTIL  THEIR VALUE AND THEIR EQUITY WAS  UP.
SO YOU JUST MADE THEM SING  AND DANCE FOR YEARS UPON YEARS  AND THEN OFFED THEM?
THE STATE MARKETING BOARD HAS  CHOSEN TO DE-EMPHASIZE THE  DANCING RAISINS.
AND THAT'S IT. THESE GUYS HAD A SATURDAY  MORNING CARTOON AND THEY WHACKED  THEM LIKE THEY WERE NOBODIES. THE TRUTH IS, MARVIN, YOU BETTER  WATCH YOUR BACK. YOU DON'T COME TO THE RAISIN  COUNCIL, THEY COME TO YOU. (LAUGHTER)  (SCREAMING)
John: INCREDIBLE WORK,  JASON. WE'LL BE RIGHT
