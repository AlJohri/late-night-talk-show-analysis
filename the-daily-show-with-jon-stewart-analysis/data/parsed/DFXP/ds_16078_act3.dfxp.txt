MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE CREATORS OF "SOUTH PARK." THE BOOK OF MORMONS JUST WON  8,000 TONY AWARDS, INCLUDING BEST MUSICAL. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM TREY PARKER AND MATT STONE.
HEY, MAN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
YES, YOU ARE THE LORDS OF BROADWAY. THAT MUST... TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TONYS. THIS WAS INCREDIBLE. EVERY TIME AN AWARD WAS UP PRETTY MUCH "BOOK OF MORMONS TOOK IT"
YEAH, IT WAS PRETTY GREAT WHEN CHRIS ROCKER SAID, "IT'S  LIKE TAKING A HOOKER OUT THE DINNER."
WHEN HE SAID, THAT I'M LIKE, DON'T SAY, THAT IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING ELSE. NO, DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
Jon: THE BROADWAY COMMUNITY CAN BE AN INSULAR, A LITTLE BIT SENATEY. DID THEY ACCEPT YOU GUYS, YOU'RE CLEARLY OUTSIDERS. MAYBE THEY THINK YOU DON'T RESPECT THEIR CRAFT. HOW DID THEY TREAT YOU GUYS?
ACTUALLY REALLY WELL. PEOPLE WARNED US BEFORE WE DID THE SHOW THAT BROADWAY YOU HAVE TO COME IN HUMBLE, YOU KNOW, COME IN LIKE, THIS DON'T COME IN GUNS ABLAZING BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE ESTABLISHMENT.
Jon: WHY WOULD THEY THINK YOU GUYS WOULD COME IN GUNS-ABLAZEIN'.
LIKE MATT SAID, WE WERE SITTING THERE AT THE TONYS AND BONO AND EDGE GOT UP THERE, AND  WE'RE LIKE, THEY DON'T HAVE A SHOW NOMINATED FOR A TONY. WHY ARE THEY HERE THIS SEASON? SO WE'RE THE SENATEY BROADWAY PEOPLE NOW.
NOW WE'RE THE ESTABLISHMENT.
WHAT ARE THOSE RAPSCALLIONS DOING HERE? AREN'T THEY ROCKERS? [IN BRITISH ACCENT]
WE HAD TO CATCH OURSELVES.
Jon: HOW COOL WOULD IT WITH TO SHAVE BONO. WHEN YOU SEE THEM, SUP, LOSER. IT'S LIKE BONO AND THE EDGE.
IT WAS PRETTY GREAT BECAUSE FOR A SOUTH PARK MOVIE, I LOST THE OSCAR TO PHIL COLLINS. SO IF I LOSE AN OSCAR TO PHIL COLLINS AND I LOSE THE ONY TO BONO, I WOULD BE SO BUMMED OUT.
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN WE DOING THE  SHOW IN OUR WORKSHOP AND ALL THE TALK WAS ABOUT SPIDER-MAN BEFORE ANYBODY HAD SEEN WHAT A TRAIN WRECK. AND WE'RE THINKING, HERE GOES, WE'RE GOING TO LOSE TO BONO, GOD DANG IT.
Jon: AND NOW IT TURNS AROUND. I GUESS THEY OPENED LAST NIGHT.
Jon: THEY OPENED LAST NIGHT, BUT HOW DOES THAT WORK THAT YOU GET TO OPEN AND THEN  YOU GET TO SAY, NO, IT'S NOT OPEN. OPEN AGAIN. AND JUST KEEP DOING IT.
WHAT ARE THEY DOING. ROCKERS TRYING TO DO BROADWAY.
Jon: I'M JUST SAYING, THE WHOLE THING IS VERY UNORTHODOX. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. YOU HAD TO GO, SO YOU FINISH "BOOK OF MORMON." YOU OPEN IT AND THEN YOU RUN  RIGHT BACK TO DO THE SOUTH PARK SEASON. WAS THERE ANY PART OF YOU IN YOUR MIND AFTER ALL THIS WERE YOU THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT, [BLEEPED] THAT? WE'RE TIRED.
NOT ME BECAUSE WE LOVE "SOUTH PARK."
IT FEELS SO GOOD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I LOVE THE CYNICISM OF THE SHOW.
WELL, THAT'S ALWAYS SO FUNNY. WE DID THAT LAST EPISODE. WE DID IT BY THE SEAT OF OUR PANTS. OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THINGS WE WERE FEELING. WE CAME BACK AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE, ARE YOU OKAY, IS THE SHOW COMING BACK? AND WE'RE LIKE, WE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME DOING THAT. IT'S FUN. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT IN AUGUST.
ALSO COMEDY CENTRAL LET US KNOW.
BUT IT'S FUNNY.
WE CAN SAY BLEEP BLEEP. [BLEEPED].
Jon: IT WAS LIKE 80 TIMES IN THAT EPISODE. YOU REMEMBER THE HULL BA LOO THAT HAPPENED ON YOUR FIRST EPISODE, [BLEEPED], TO SEE HOW  MANY TIMES YOU COULD SAY IT. HOW MANY TIMES WAS IT BY THE WAY?
164.
I HAD 162.
160 SOMETHING.
Jon: 160 SOMETHING, BECAUSE WE USED TO HAVE A RULE ON THIS SHOW, COMEDY CENTRAL, NOTHING  BUT SUPPORTIVE TO US, THAT YOU COULD SAY DILDO THREE TIMES BUT NOT FOUR. [LAUGHTER]
FOUR DILDOS IS DISGUSTING. THAT'S JUST VULGAR.
Jon: YOU SAY IT THREE TIMES AND YOUR AUDIENCE IS DISGUSTED. THE FOURTH TIME THEY CANCEL THEIR CABLE PACKAGE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS. NOW I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY AIR US LIKE AT BREAKFAST OR IN SCHOOLS.
EDUCATIONAL.
WHAT HAPPENED WAS I WAS WATCHING TNT AFTER A BASKETBALL GAME, AND SOME CRAPPY COP SHOW  WAS ON, AND THEY SAID [BLEEPED]. AND I WAS LIKE, THERE'S IN BLEEP. I WAS LIKE, WAITS A SECOND, I HAD OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER CALL AND SAY, IT'S WEIRD THAT WE  BLEEP, CAN WE JUST SAY  [BLEEPED]. IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO ABUSER, JUST HERE AND THERE. AND THEN TWO OR THREE WEEKS LATER, HEY HAD TO DO THIS WHOLE  [BLEEPED] SHOW. IT'S LIKE ALL OVER THE PLACE. TOTALLY NOT PLANNED.
Jon: I LOVE IT. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE SITTING AT HOME ONE DAY AND YOU  JUST HEAR SOMEONE SAY [BLEEPED].
IT WILL HIP.  -- HAPPEN.
Jon: "BOOK OF MORMON" PLAYING ON BROADWAY. IT IS NOW SOLD OUT THROUGH 2019.
FOREVER. DON'T EVEN TRY.
Jon: BUT IT'S AWESOME. YOU GUYS HEADING BACK OUT WEST AND DOING SOME MORE SHOWS?
WE HAVE THE SUMMER OFF. I'M GOING TO BE IN COLORADO A LOT AND GO HOME.
Jon: AS YOU KNOW, ANY TIME YOU'RE BACK IN NEW YORK, STANDING OFFER, STEAK DINNER. WE ALL KNOW THAT. TREY PARKER, MATT STONE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
