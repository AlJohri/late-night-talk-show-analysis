Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW. OBVIOUSLY WE SPOKE FOR A LITTLE LONGER SO IT SEEMED TO BE AN ABRUPT EDIT THE REST IS UP ON THE WEB. IT WAS NICE TO SEE HIM HERE. SO IN A YEAR FILLED WITH GUT PUNCHES THIS WEEKEND DELIVERED ONE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE WON'T SOON RECOVER FROM. HERE IT IS YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
WHEN YOU ARE FIRST STARTING OUT YOU HAVE TO ACT WHEREVER YOU CAN. YOU CAN'T BE PICKY. YOU REALLY HAVE TO ACT WHEREVER YOU CAN AND WHEREVER YOU GET A CHANCE TO ACT AND THAT MIGHT  EVEN BE JUST IN AN AUDITION ROOM. THIS IS SOMETHING A TEACHER TOLD ME YEARS AGO AND HE IS RIGHT. EVEN IF YOU ARE AUDITIONING FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET, OR YOU MIGHT HAVE READ IT AND DON'T LIKE IT BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO GO. IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO ACT IN A ROOM THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAS PAID RENT FOR THEN YOU ARE GIVEN A FREE CHANCE TO PRACTICE YOUR CRAFT. IN THAT MOMENT YOU SHOULD ACT AS WELL AS YOU CAN BECAUSE IF YOU LEAVE THE ROOM OR THEATER WHEREVER YOU ARE AND YOU'VE ACTED AS WELL AS YOU CAN THERE'S NO WAY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WATCHED YOU WILL FORGET IT.
