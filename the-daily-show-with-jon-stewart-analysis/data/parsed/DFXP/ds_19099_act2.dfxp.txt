Jon: WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW WITH THE 2014 PRIMARIES UNDER WAY THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ARE EACH FIGHTING TO APPEAL TO THEIR BASE. BUT, HOW CAN CONCERTIVE VOTERS TELL WHO IS THE REAL MR. RIGHT? JORDAN KLEPPER REPORTS.
AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE 2014 MID-TERM ELECTIONS REPUBLICANS ARE TERRIFIED OF BEING PRIMARY FROM THE RIGHT. BUT SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM ISN'T GOING TO HAVE THAT PROBLEM. ACCORDING TO SUPPORTER AND FORMER CONGRESSMAN BOB INGLIS.
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PERSON IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA SENATE RACE.
AND WITH ENDORSEMENTS FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, NATIONAL RIGHT TO LIFE, EVEN THE MINING ASSOCIATION NO ONE WOULD DARE TAKE ON THIS CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGUE.
I BELIEVE I'M THE TRUE CONSERVATIVE IN THIS RACE.
SERIOUSLY.
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS NOT A TRUE CONSERVATIVE.
THAT IS CANDIDATE BILL CONNOR. SO, WHAT MAKES HIM THINK HE CAN CHALLENGE LINDSEY GRAHAM FROM THE RIGHT?
I'M VERY PROUD TO HAVE BEEN ENDORSED BY ALMOST VERY EARLY ON BY THE FACEBOOK TEA PARTY WHICH IS 16,000 PEOPLE THAT THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND THE GRANDPARENT RIGHTS ASSOCIATION.
REALLY?
YES.
SO, THERE REALLY IS A GRANDPARENTS RIGHTS ASSOCIATION?
THERE IS.
DO THEY JUDGE BY HOW MANY BUTTERSCOTCH CANDIES YOU GIVE AWAY OR BY THE NUMBER OF NICKLES THEY GET OUT OF GRANDKIDS EARS?
YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK THEM.
I'LL BE DAMNED, I GUESS IT TURNS OUT BILL CONNOR IS THE MOST CONSERVE ACTIVE MAN IN THIS RACE. CASE CLOSED.
THE MOST CONSERVATIVE MAN IN THE RACE IS LEE BRIGHT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WHO THE (bleep) IS LEE BRIGHT?
LEE BRIGHT IS THE BEEF, THE FULL PATTY.
LARRY RISVOLD AND JEFF MATTOCK SUPPORT LEE BRIGHT WHO IS RUNNING TO THE RIGHT OF CONNOR WHO IS RUNNING TO THE RIGHT OF GRAHAM.
LEE BRIGHT HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY THE GUN OWNERS OF AMERICA.
WITH ALL OF THESE CONSERVATIVE VOICES IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS TIME FOR AN OLD TIME CONSERVATIVE ENDORSEMENT OFF.
I WOULD LIKE TO MUCH MORE LOOK TOWARD GROWTH AS THE STANDARD BEARER FOR WHAT CONSERVATIVES SHOULD BE. THE NATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION IS SIGNIFICANT.
TAXPAYER HERO AWARD.
DOES GRAHAM HAVE A TAXPAYER HERO AWARD?
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN --
I'M TRYING TO PARSE IT OUT IN MY HEAD. THE FACEBOOK TEA PARTY ENDORSEMENT IS THAT TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT OF THE TAXPAYER HERO AWARD?
I'D SAY IT'S PROBABLY TO THE RIGHT.
THE REPUBLICAN LIBERTY CAUCUS.
THE AMERICAN COALITION FOR ETHANOL.
NATIONAL TEA PARTY LEADERS.
THE GREAT POSSUM SOCIETY.
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM.
DOES LEE BRIGHT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE GREAT POSSUM SOCIETY?
THEY DON'T ENDORSE. >>OK OK, THIS WAS TRICKY.  MAYBE THERE WAS SOME WAY TO DO THIS QUANTITIVELY.
LINDSEY HAS AN AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION RATING OF 92%, HE'S GOT A 0 WITH THE LGBT HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN.
WOW, THAT'S GREAT.
ZERO IS ZERO IN OTHER WORDS HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO HELP THEM ON THEIR AGENDA.
AND, WHO WOULDN'T WANT A ZERO FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN? WHAT ELSE DO WE GOT ON THERE?
HE'S GOT A 92 WITH THE NRA.
ISN'T THAT GOOD?
JUST A 92. THERE'S A WHOLE 8% LEFT. THAT IS DANGEROUS.
YOU THINK 92 IS A GOOD GRADE?
92 A VERY GOOD GRADE, YEAH. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, MAYBE HE VOTED AGAINST HAVING A BAZOOKA OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW.
100 IS A GOOD GRADE.
WELL, I GUESS THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT.
NOW WE'RE TALKING.
WELL, IF THEY GIVE EXTRA CREDIT 110%.
CAN I GET A 115%? DO I HEAR 130%?
WHAT ABOUT 140%? THIS WAS NECK IN NECK. SURE, WE COULD DISSECT EACH CANDIDATE'S CONSERVATIVE BONAFIDES VIS A VIS A SERIOUS OF DEBATES IN THE SPIRIT OF LINCOLN VERSUS DOUGLAS, OR WE COULD SETTLE IT THE RIGHT WAY.
WHAT IS YOUR IN POCKET.
WHAT IS YOUR POCKET RIGHT NOW?
A CONSTITUTION. THIS IS MEGA POINTS.
THANK YOU.
THERE WE GO. THAT IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
OH, I GOT A WALLET WITH A DRIVER'S LICENSE.
STOP. WHAT THE (bleep) MAN LARRY, JEFF AND THE OTHER GUY TOTALLY HAD A CONSTITUTION ON THEM.
SINCE I'VE GOT MY iPHONE, I CAN ALWAYS LOOK IT UP.
YOU HAVE AN iPHONE?
YEAH.
OH, MY GOD JOE BIDEN. I'M GOING TO DOCK YOU LIKE 600 POINTS FOR THAT. GRAHAM WAS OUT. IT WAS DOWN TO CONNER AND BRIGHT TO FIGHT FOR THE MANTLE OF MOST CONSERVATIVE. WHAT DO YOU SEE, BILL?
PATRIOTISM.
SERIOUSLY?
CHICK-FIL-A.
GOOD. TEN POINTS.
CLEARLY, OR SOUTH CAROLINA LARRY AND JEFF BACKED THE CANDIDATE WITH THE TRUE CONSERVATIVE VISION.
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO NOT BE GOING OVER DOING ALL THESE WARS.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA WHAT?
WE SPEND LESS ON WELFARE THAN WE DO CORPORATE WELFARE.
WOAH, SLOW DOWN, SAN FRANCISCO.
THERE ARE NO LOBBYISTS FOR WE THE PEOPLE.
OH, MY GOD.
THESE FOLKS RUNNING TO LINDSEY'S SUPPOSEDLY TO HIS RIGHT AREN'T -- YOU KNOW, THE SPECTRUM COMES AROUND AND TOUCHES. IT'S NOT REALLY A LINE. IT'S REALLY A BOW.
SO, IF WE GO OVER THE BEND WE'RE GOING TO END UP ON THE -- JESUS CHRIST I'M ON THE LEFT OVER HERE.
YES, YOU GET TO THE LEFT, YOU REALLY DO.
BE CAREFUL LINDSEY GRAHAM, YOU'RE GOING TO GET PRIMARY FROM BOTH SIDES.
Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
