WILT COME BACK, WE'RE HERE ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. ARE YOU CERTAIN OF, IT'S THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE. HOW MANY YEARS IS THIS NOW.
EIGHT.
HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE, YOU ARE GOING TO THERE, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GOING TO BE THERE. MITT ROMNEY IS GOING TO BE THERE. CONDOLEEZZA RICE IS GOING TO BE THERE. EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT MOHAMMED MORSE SYGOING TO BE THERE. HOW DO YOU GET KNEES PEOPLE... WHAT KIND OF FOOD DO YOU SERVE? HOW DO YOU GET A GROUP LIKE THIS TOGETHER IN COOPERATION TO MOVE FORWARD? WHAT'S THE PITCH?
AND THE LEADER OF LIBYA IS GOING TO BE THERE. AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL HEAR FROM HIM THAT HE REALLY LIKED THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR WHO WAS KILLED. AND THAT THEY TRIED TO SAVE HIS LIFE. AND THAT HE WANTS AMERICA TO STAY THERE.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS. BUT WE STARTED DOING THIS, THEY COME BECAUSE IT'S AT THE OPENING OF THE U.N.. A LOT OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE IN NEW YORK. WE INVITE THEM ALL TO COME. WE INVITE MANY OF THEM TO PARTICIPATE. ELLEN GENERAL SON TURLEY, NOBEL PRIZE WINNING PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA, A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, SHE HAS BEEN TO A LOT OF OUR PROGRAMS, A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE COME YEAR IN, YEAR OUT. THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE U.N. AND PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK DR. JIM KIM AND THE PRESIDENT OF WAL-MART ARE GOING TO BE THERE AT THE OPENING TO TALK ABOUT-- .
Jon: DOES HE GREET PEOPLE AS THEY WALK IN?
NO, HE HIRES UNEMPLOYED SENIOR CITIZENS LIKE ME TO DO THAT. BUT... .
Jon: ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH.
BUT LOOK, HERE'S WHY HE IS COMING. AND I GOT HIM TO CHANGE HIS SCHEDULE TO COME FOR THIS REASON. WAL-MART HAS DEPLOYED MORE PHOTO VOLTAICS ON THEIR BUILDING THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY IN AMERICA. THEY ARE THE NUMBER ONE SOLAR COMPANY IN AMERICA NOW. AND THEY ALSO RUN SOME OF THEIR BUILDINGS WITH WIND ENERGY. AND THEY ALSO HAVE CUT THEIR PACKAGING. AND I WANT HIM TO DESCRIBE WHAT I AM TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT, WHICH IS, MOST PEOPLE MAKE MONEY AND DECIDE I WANT TO DO SOMETHING GOOD. THAT'S A NOBLE AND GOOD THING. THEY HAVE DECIDED INSTEAD TO GO BACK TO SQUARE ONE AND SAY WHAT GOOD DO WE WANT. WE WANT TO AVOID THE WORST CONSEQUENCE OF GLOBAL WARMING. WE WANT TO CUT OUR ENERGY BILL, WE WANT TO MAKE IT MORE PREDICTABLE OVER THE LONG RUN. HOW SHOULD WE DESIGN OUR STORES. HOW SHOULD WE DESIGN OUR TRUCK ROUTES, HOW SHOULD WE DESIGNED WAY WE PACKAGE OUR PRODUCTS FROM THE BEGINNING TO GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO IN THE END. WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT, INSTEAD OF FIXING THINGS WHEN WE GET COMFORTABLE, HOW CAN WE ALL AT EVERY INCOME LEVEL, WE'RE ALSO FLYING NONGOVERNMENTAL GROUPS IN FROM SOME OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD TO BE A PART OF THIS DEBATE. HOW DO YOU HAVE THE MAXIMUM IMPACT BY THINKING MORE ABOUT IT IN THE BEGINNING, HOW YOU ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE FOCUS ON THIS YEAR. AND IT'S REALLY QUITE EXCITING. BUT EVEN IT IS AT THE NEXUS OF WHAT THE FUTURE OF THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND NGOs AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY WILL BE. AND IT'S WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER, THIS IDEA THAT THESE ARE NOT AN TAG NIS STICK FORCES. THEY CAN BE COUNTERVEILING FORCES BUT THEY MUST AT SOME LEVEL BE SYMBIOTIC. THEY MUST WORK TOGETHER.
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE PLACES IN AMERICA THAT ARE DOING WELL. ANYBODY HERE FROM SAN DIEGO? SAN DIEGO IS... THERE YOU GO. ONE OF OUR GREAT NAVAL CITIES, AND IT STILL IS. BUT IT IS ALSO THE CENTER OF HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH IN AMERICA. PRIVATE SECTOR, CRAIG VINNER WAS IN A RACE IN AFFECT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT CON SORECIOUS WITH THE SEQUENCING GENOME IN 20 THOUSAND. STARTED WITH A BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT TO FEDERAL RESEARCH AT THE END OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S TERM AND I PUT $3 BILLION OF YOUR MONEY IN IT.
Jon: MINE... .
AND IT'S ALREADY, I WAS AT ST. JUDE'S CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN MEMPHIS JUST ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO LOOKING AT CHILDREN WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED BECAUSE WE NOW CAN SEE HOW THEIR DIFFERENCE, GENETIC DIFFERENCE REQUIRE DIFFERENT MEDICINE TO CURE THE SAME KIND OF CANCER IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. OKAY. SO YOU HAVE GOT HIS FOUNDATION, AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO MEDICAL DIAG PUTTING OUT ALL THESE SCIENTISTS. YOU HAVE THE REPUBLICAN MAYOR OF SAN DIEGO INVITING PEOPLE IN, AND THE BIGGEST COMPUTER COMPANY, QUALCOMM HEADED BY A DEMOCRAT, AND THEY HAVE SPAWNED 700 MORE COMPUTER COMPANIES. AND SAN DIEGO, WHY? BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE GOVERNMENT, THE NONPROFIT SECTOR, AND THE BUSINESS IS SECTOR WORKING TOGETHER TO DO THIS. ORLANDO HAS 100 COMPUTER SIMULATION COMPANIES, WHY? DISNEY WORLD, UNIVERSAL THEME PARK, THEY NEED THOSE COMPUTER SIMULATORS. THE GLOBAL ENT TAINTED. ARCH VIDEO GAME, ANYBODY THAT HAS EVER BEEN LIKE ME HOOKED ON A VIDEO GAME KNOWS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE GOOD SIMULATION TO KEEP YOURSELF IN A CONSTANT STATE OF ANXIETY... AND WAIT A MINUTE, AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND NASA AND THEY ALL PUT MONEY IN THERE TOGETHER AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA HAS 63,000 STUDENTS, THEY FEED THEM IN. WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT? BECAUSE WHEN THEY WORK TOGETHER, THEY ARE SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN WHEN THEY SIT AROUND AND FIGHT ALL THE TIME. WHAT IS THE RESULT, 100 NEW COMPUTER SIMULATION COMPANIES. THAT IS WHAT IS WORKING IN AMERICA TODAY. LOOK, THIS ECONOMICS IS NOT IDEOLOGY. IT'S HARD WORK. AND IT'S SEEING WHAT THE COMPETITION IS DOING. ANALYZING THE ALTERNATIVE.
Jon: RESULTS ORIENTED, MERIT ITS ORIENTED.
AND KEEPING SCORE, THAT IS WHAT AMERICA NEEDS, WE NEED TO GENT THE SHOW ON THE ROAD HERE AND STOP ALL THIS KIND OF MINDLESS AND FIGHTING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
