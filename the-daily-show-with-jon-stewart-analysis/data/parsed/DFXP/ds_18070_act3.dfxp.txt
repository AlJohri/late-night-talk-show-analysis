Jon: UM, AH, -- [LAUGHTER]
DON'T BE NERVOUS.
Jon: THANK YOU, SANDY, I  APPRECIATE THAT SANDY, YOU WERE  THE FIRST WOMAN SELECTED FOR THE SUPREME COURT. THAT WAS AN ENORMOUS HONOR BUT  ALSO ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY. HOW DID YOU HANDLE THAT?
AS BEST I COULD. I JUST WANTED TO BE RESPECTFUL  OF THE POSITION, CLEARLY A VERY  IMPORTANT, MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT COURT.
Jon: RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]

Jon: IT IS ONE OF THE MOST  IMPORTANT COURTS.
WHEN I GOT THERE JOHN STEVENS  AND I WENT OUT FOR AN ALL-NIGHT  BENDER.
