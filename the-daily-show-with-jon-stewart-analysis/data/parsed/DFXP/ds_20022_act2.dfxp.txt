Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, PLEASE WELCOME AMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ HOW ARE YA?
GREAT!
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
DELIGHTED.
Jon: NOW, YOU HAVE BEEN EVERYWHERE. YOU JUST GOT BACK, OR JUST RECENTLY GOT BACK FROM -- WERE YOU IN LIBERIA?
LIBERIA, GUINEA AND SIERRA LEONE.
Jon: AND YOU WERE OBSERVING THE UNITED NATIONS RESPONSE OR THE U.S. RESPONSE TO EBOLA.
CORRECT.
Jon: CORRECT. AND YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT WHEN YOU CAME UP AND SHOOK MY HAND. YOU SHOOK MY HAND!
IT'S TRUE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ARE YOU EXCITED NEW YORKERS CAN ONCE AGAIN LICK THE SUBWAYS?
MAYBE AFTERWARDS I'LL HEAD TO THE SUBWAY.
Jon: YOU DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THAT. SO WHAT DID YOU FIND? ARE WE GETTING A HANDLING ON THIS EPIDEMIC WITHIN AFRICA?
BASICALLY, WE ARE BUILDING THE AIRPLANE AS WE FLY IT AND IT HAS NOT BEEN PRETTY AT ALL TIMES. PEOPLE ARE LEARNING A LOT AS THEY GO ABOUT WHAT EBOLA IS, WHAT IT ISN'T. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE, IN REMOTE AREAS OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE NO ROADS.
Jon: RIGHT.
WHERE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN CLINICS IN A LONG TIME.
Jon: CIVIL WAR, THEY'RE RACKED WITH YEARS OF CIVIL WAR.
EXACTLY. AND JUST AS THESE COUNTRIES WERE RECOVERING FROM THOSE WARS, HERE COMES EBOLA. BUT THE RESPONSE ACTUALLY HAS BEEN REMARKABLE AND PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE WEEKS WE'VE STARTED TOO SEE THE RETURN ON THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN MAKING. SO SAFE BURIAL WHICH IS A HUGELY IMPORTANT PART OF A RESPONSE...
Jon: RIGHT.
WAS DISASTROUS. THE BURIAL PRACTICES THAT PEOPLE HAD WERE THE MAIN REASON --
Jon: NOW THIS IS BECAUSE THE BODY BECOMES INCREDIBLY INFECTIOUS THE WORSE THE DISEASE GETS.
YEAH.
Jon: SO IF SOMEBODY PASSES AWAY, THEIR BODY IS STILL IN SOME WAYS ACTIVE WITH THE DISEASE.
CORRECT. AND IN THE CULTURE, THE DESIRE TO EMBRACE THE BODY AND ALL KINDS OF RITUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TRADITIONAL BURIAL RITES...
Jon: RIGHT.
WERE REALLY FUELING THE SPREAD OF THE EPIDEMIC.
Jon: I SEE.
C.D.C. THINKS AS MANY AS 70% OF INFECTIONS WERE COMING FROM UNSAFE BURIAL.
Jon: OH FOR GOODNESS SAKES, THAT'S TRAGIC. RIGHT.
BUT, JUST THREE WEEKS AGO THE SAFE BURIAL RATE IN FREETOWN, THE CAPITAL OF SIERRA LEONE WAS ABOUT 30%.
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT BAD WITHIN 24 HOURS OF A DEATH. NOW IT'S CLOSE TO 100%, ABOUT 98%.
Jon: I SEE.
SAME IN MONROVIA WHERE THE U.S. HAS SENT 2,000 TROOPS, THEY'RE NOW FANNING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, MASSIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN SAFE BURIAL.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO, IF THAT CAN BE SCALED TO THE COMMUNITIES IN THE RURAL AREAS, WHICH ARE PRETTY HARD TO GET TO, SO IT'S NO EASY TASK, YOU CAN SEE BENDING THE CURVE. BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET.
Jon: BUT WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB HERE OF AT LEAST TRYING TO DEMONIZE ANYONE WHO WOULD GO THERE TO HELP. (LAUGHTER) AND I THINK, IN THE WAY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS OR SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE GONE THERE AND TRY TO STEM, WE'VE TRIED TO DO OUR BEST TO SHUN THEM WHEN THEY GET BACK. HAS THAT HELPED? IS THAT? (APPLAUSE)
SHUNNING HEALTH WORKERS IS NOT ON THE TOP OF C.D.C.'S LIST OF THINGS TO DO TO CURE AN EPIDEMIC. BUT WHAT WE DO NEED IS MORE DOCTORS, AND ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE SAID IN THE REGION IS HOW AMAZING IT WAS TO SEE PRESIDENT OBAMA HUGGING NINA PHAM, TO SEE THE HEALTH WORKERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE BEING HEROIZED AS THEY SHOULD BE. I MEAN, TO SEE THESE PEOPLE IN ACTION. THEY'RE WEARING THESE SWELTERING SUITS. THEY CAN ONLY WORK FOR TWO HOURS AT A TIME. THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. THEY'RE AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES.
Jon: NOW WHY, WHY IS IT TWO HOURS? IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE --
THE HEAT AND OPPRESSION BASICALLY.
Jon: I SEE.
I'M NOT DOING A GREAT JOB OF SELLING THE IDEA OF BECOMING A HEALTH WORKER PREHAPS. BUT --
Jon: NO, NO, NO SO FAR I'M LIKING WHAT I'M HEARING. (LAUGHTER)
YEAH, YEAH. BUT IT'S AMAZING THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE, DOING THIS FOR SIX-WEEK ROTATIONS. AND WE HAVE, THERE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED WORKERS WHO ARE IN THE THREE COUNTRIES RIGHT NOW.
Jon: RIGHT. BUT THE U.N. ESTIMATES WE NEED ABOUT A THOUSAND, AND SO THAT WILL REQUIRE HOSPITALS AND FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES RALLYING AROUND THE IDEA OF SENDING OUR MEDICAL --
Jon: DOES THE U.N. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, DO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE KINDS OF RESOURCES OR DOES IT HAVE TO COME FROM N.G.O.s AND OTHER GROUPS ON THE GROUND? DO THEY HAVE THAT AS PART OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE?
THERE'S NO STANDING ARMY OF DOCTORS WEARING BLUE HELMETS JUST WAITING TO DEPLOY.
Jon: RIGHT. WHY IS THAT? ISN'T THAT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD PROPOSE?
I THINK OUT OF THIS CRISIS THERE WILL BE A LOT OF LEARNING. WE'RE, RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL BUILDING THAT PLANE AND TRYING TO LAND IT, BUT WE WILL NEED TO ESTABLISH I THINK ROSTERS OF MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS IN THE EVENT OF MAJOR OUTBREAKS LIKE THIS.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE GREAT THING IS, IF THERE'S ANYTHING GREAT IS TO BE SAID ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE WILL HAVE BUILT MUSCLE MEMORY THAT WE NEVER HAVE BEFORE.
Jon: RIGHT.
I MEAN, FOR THE UNITED STATES TO SEND SEVERAL HUNDRED HEALTH WORKERS OVER THE LAST --
Jon: WE'LL HAVE EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH THIS.
YEAH AND THEN THEY'LL TELL THEIR COLLEAGUES AGAIN THAT IT GIVES THEM SUCH A GREAT SENSE OF SATISFACTION. I MEAN HERE, I WAS DESCRIBING AGAIN THE EXPERIENCE OF WEARING THESE SUITS AND BEING OUT IN THE HEAT AND TREATING THESE PEOPLE.
Jon: RIGHT.
I'VE NEVER MET HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO DESCRIBED A GREATER SENSE OF SATISFACTION.
Jon: RIGHT. I MEAN, EVERY DOCTOR LOVES TO HEAL.
Jon: RIGHT. WELL, CERTAINLY NOT IN MY INSURANCE NETWORK I HAVEN'T MET ANYBODY WHO LIKES THAT. (LAUGHTER) ALRIGHT, SO, SO WE TALKED ABOUT EBOLA. WE'LL COME BACK AND YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE FIXING I.S.I.S. OR I.S.I.L OR THE DAESH OR WHATEVER THEY CALL THE INDIVIDUALS TAKING OVER APPARENTLY NOT JUST OUR PLANET BUT THE UNIVERSE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE FROM AMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
