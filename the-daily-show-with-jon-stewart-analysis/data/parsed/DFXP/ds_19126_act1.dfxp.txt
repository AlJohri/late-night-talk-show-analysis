FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, WE LOVE, WE LOVE THIS WOMAN, MELISSA McCARTHY IS GOING TO BE JOINING US TONIGHT. WE'RE SO PLEASED ABOUT THAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT FIRST, IT'S A FUNNY STORY, REMEMBER THAT TIME WE INVADED IRAQ TO REMOVE THE THREAT OF THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS PEOPLE USING THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS WEAPONS AND IT TURNED OUT THE THREAT WASN'T THERE? WELL, GOOD NEWS, THE THREAT'S THERE NOW. [LAUGHTER] IN SOME MEASURE DUE TO THE DESTABILIZING EFFECT OF OUR INTERVENTION. AND, YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO HYPED THE ORIGINAL PLAN WOULD LIKE TO DO NOW.
WE MUST GRAPPLE WITH HOW BEST TO HELP IRAQ MEET THIS THREAT.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT WE STOP ISIS FROM GAINING THIS FOOTHOLD IN IRAQ.
WE NEED AIR POWER IMMEDIATELY TO STOP THE ADVANCE.
WE HAVE TO ACT. WE MUST ACT.
Jon: WE MUST. [LAUGHTER] ACT. WELL, IF WE DO, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO NEED ACTING LESSONS. LOOK. BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS STARRING IN A NEW PLAY CALLED "A STREETCAR NAMED WE'RE ALWAYS WRONG." [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. LISTEN UP. HERE'S HOW WE DO IT -- BY THE WAY, IRAQ ISN'T THE ONLY PLACE THAT THESE GUYS WANT THE PLAY TO OPEN.
I SUPPORT PUTTING PEOPLE IN AFRICA. THAT'S WHERE THIS WAR IS HEADED.
CHAD HAS BEEN SCREAMING FOR HELP FROM THE UNITED STATES.
IN LIBYA WE CAN HAVE A INFLUENCE.
HELPING THE RESISTANCE IN SYRIA.
WHATEVER THE KURDS NEED WE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM.
HELP ARM THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE.
Jon: THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR AMERICAN MILITARY  ASSISTANCE. IN FACT, IN A BLIND WEAPONS TEST, NINE OUT OF TEN CLIENT STATES PREFER WEAPONS FROM THE UNITED STATES TO THOSE FROM I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT AMERICA. YES, THERE IS APPARENTLY NO COUNTRY REPUBLICANS WILL NOT PUT UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE UNITED STATES. EXCEPT ONE.
SENATE REPUBLICANS TODAY DEFEATED A $60 BILLION PLAN FOR INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS.
SENATE REPUBLICANS BLOCKING A BILL THAT WOULD RENEW EXPIRED TAX BREAKS.
BLOCKED A $21 BILLION VETERANS BILL.
BLOCKED AN INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE.
BLOCKED THE PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT.
BLOCK UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.
NO IS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT.
WE'RE THE PARTY OF HELL NO. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WELL, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A TERRIBLE PARTY. I MEAN, WITH WILL THERE BE DANCING AND PIZZA?
HELL NO.
Jon: OH! I GOT AN IDEA. I GOT AN IDEA. HOW ABOUT NOT MAKING IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO GET FOOD STAMPS.
HELL NO.
Jon: OKAY. DO YOU DO ANYTHING BUT COMPLAIN BITTERLY ANYMORE?
HELL NO. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IF YOU'RE A DOODIE HEAD, SAY "HELL NO."
HELL NO. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NOW, BUT SERIOUSLY, THEY MUST HAVE... THE REPUBLICANS MUST HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR BLOCKING EVERY DOMESTIC BILL THAT COMES ACROSS THEIR DESKS.
WE CANNOT AFFORD IT. WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.
AMERICA'S GOING BROKE.
THE GOVERNMENT IS BROKE.
YOU CAN'T KEEP SPENDING MORE MONEY THAN YOU HAVE.
Jon: WE'RE SPENDING MONEY WILLY-NILLY. AND DID YOU KNOW WE'RE SAVING UP TO GET A MORE PATRIOTIC AMERICAN STATUE OF LIBERTY. BA-BAM! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW, THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF REASONS WHY REPUBLICANS BELIEVE DOMESTIC SPENDING IS FOLLY.
BIG GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WORK.
MASSIVE GOVERNMENT SPENDING, PARTICULARLY DEBT SPENDING, IS NOT THE SOLUTION.
LAST THING WE WANT DO IS ADD TO THE DEBT AND DEFICIT.
THE NEGATIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF OUR GOOD INTENTIONS.
RAMPANT WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR PROGRAMS ENCOURAGE WORK, NOT DEPENDENCE.
OUR POLICY CANNOT BE TO SIMPLY RELEGATE MORE AND MORE OF OUR CITIZENS TO DEPENDENCE ON THE GOVERNMENT.
Jon: BY THE WAY, DOES OUT OF CONTROL GOVERNMENT SPENDING HAVE THE SAME CORRUPTING EFFECT ON NON-AMERICANS.
AMERICA'S GOAL IN IRAQ WAS TO HELP THE IRAQI PEOPLE TO BUILD A DEMOCRATIC NATION THAT CAN GOVERN ITSELF.
CREATE REAL DEMOCRACY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT IT.
WE HELP AFGHANS BEGIN TO BUILD A NEW DEMOCRACY, BUILD THEIR ECONOMY AND PROVIDE BASIC SERVICE AND EXPAND HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS OPEN UP SCHOOLS.
AND ALLOWING FOR FREEDOM TO SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD.
Jon: SO BASICALLY WHEN WE GIVE OTHER COUNTRIES GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE, THEY HANDLE IT GREAT. BUT WHEN WE GET IT OURSELVES, WE [BLEEPED] IT ALL UP. [LAUGHTER] WHY IS IT YOU DON'T SEEM TO CARE ABOUT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES, WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE AND CULTURE DEPENDENCY WHEN IT COMES TO THE UNLIMITED CHECKBOOK WE HAVE FOR FOREIGN MILITARY ADVENTURES?
OF COURSE THE WAR HAS BEEN COSTLY, BUT WE'VE BEEN PROTECTED FROM ATTACK HERE AT HOME.
Jon: BULL [BLEEPED]. PUTTING ASIDE THE QUESTIONABLE CONTENTION THAT THE WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN HAVE KEPT US SAFE HERE AT HOME, YOU DO KNOW TERRORISM ISN'T THE ONLY THING AMERICANS WOULD LIKE TO BE PROTECTED FROM.
THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS GIVES AMERICA'S CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE A D-PLUS.
THE V.A. SAYS AT LEAST 23 PEOPLE HAVE DIED WAITING FOR CARE.
50 MILLION AMERICANS LIVING BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE.
TEMPERATURES COULD GO UP BY 9 DEGREES THIS CENTURY, AND SEA LEVELS COULD RISE AN EXTRA 10 TO 21 INCHES.
30 AMERICANS DIE FROM GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY SINGLE DAY.
Jon: NONE OF IT IS TERRORISM, RIGHT? BECAUSE THEN WE'D HAVE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IF THERE WAS ONE MAN WHO EMBODIED THE ETHOS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THIS REGARD, I'D HAVE TO SAY, IT'S OUR OLD FRIEND JEFF SESSIONS OF ALABAMA. NEVER MET A WAR APPROPRIATIONS BILL HE DIDN'T LIKE. HAPPY TO SPEND THE MONEY OVERSEAS.
WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO OUR TROOPS, AND THEY'RE PREPARED TO PUT THEIR LIVES AT STAKE FOR US. AND, I DON'T THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE THE SLIGHTEST SUGGESTION IN ANY WAY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HONOR THAT COMMITMENT.
WHO DO I MAKE THE CHECK OUT TO, SIR? AND OF COURSE, HE'S NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT.
SO YOU HAVE FAITH THAT THE COST OF THIS WAR IN CASUALTIES AND THE COST OF LIKE HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS OF RISKS IN TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD NOT LIKING WHAT WE'RE DOING WHICH IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS IS ALL WORTH IT BECAUSE IF WE DO FAIL, THINGS FAIL, AND WE COME HOME OR WE COME HOME AND AFTER WE COME HOME, IT FAILS OVER THERE, THEY GO BACK TO SOME MILITARY COUP. ISN'T THAT DANGER THAT WE CAN'T CHANGE THE COURSE OF A COUNTRY IF WE'RE ONLY GOING TO BE THERE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME?
WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
Jon: OH, HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IT! WHAT? [LAUGHTER] UNLIMITED MONEY TO GO OVER THERE. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING BAD'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WELL, HOW ABOUT SPENDING SOME MONEY ON CLEANING UP THE MESS YOU MADE HERE AT HOME FOR THE VETERANS.
WE NEED TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO CREATE MORE ENTITLEMENTS AND MORE ENTITLEMENTS, WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'RE HEADING RECKLESSLY TO A FISCAL CRISIS. BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD CREATE A BLANK CHECK, AN UNLIMITED ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM NOW.
Jon: GO [BLEEPED] YOURSELF. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M WORRIED. I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS. THEIR INABILITY TO WEAN THEMSELVES OFF OF MILITARY INTERVENTION. THEY HAVE A CULTURE OF DEFENDANCY, IF YOU, WILL AND I BELIEVE IT'S TURNED THEM ALL INTO WARFARE QUEENS. AND, I THINK WE NEED TO CUT THEM OFF FOR THEIR OWN GOOD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
