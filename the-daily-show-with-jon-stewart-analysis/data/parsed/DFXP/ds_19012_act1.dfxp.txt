FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAD A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. FROM THE AMAZING FILM 12 YEARS A SLAVE WHICH IS PHENOMENAL, AND THIS GENTLEMAN IS PHENOMENAL, CHIWETEL EJIOFOR-- IN THE FILM, HE KNOCKS IT OUT OF THE PARK. BUT FIRST, OUR TOP STORY, NEW REPORTS THAT COULD MAKE OUR ALREADY ICY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTRY OF PAKISTAN COLDER THAN A WITCH'S-- FROZEN DESSERT TREAT TIT.
TWO INFLUENTIAL HUMAN RIGHT GROUPS ARE OUT WITH SCATHING REPORTS ABOUT U.S. DRONE STRIKES OVERSEAS THE GROUPS CLAIM MORE CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN PAKISTAN THAN THE U.S. HAS ACKNOWLEDGED.
THE NEW PRIME MINISTER IS NOT GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY ABOUT ALL OF THIS.
Jon: OH, I'M SORRY, PAKISTAN. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU DIDN'T LIKE YOUR CITIZENS BEING  SKY-SSASINATED ON THE WHIMS OF A FOREIGN SUPERPOWER. WE THOUGHT YOU WERE COOL. (LAUGHTER) I GUESS IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT GOOD THING IS I GUESS WE CAN JUST LAY LOW FOR A WHILE AND JUST GET BACK IF TOUCH WITH PAKISTAN WHEN THE WOUNDS AREN'T SO FRESH, YOU KNOW.
TONIGHT PAKISTAN'S PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR HIS FIRST FACE-TO-FACE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AWKWARD. (LAUGHTER) BOY, THAT'S THE SORT OF MEETING WHERE YOU REALLY NEED OLD BO IN THE ROOM, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, SOMETHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT. YEAH, I KNOW THOSE DRONE STRIKES ARE [BLEEP] UP, BUT HE REALLY LIKES THAT BONE, LOOK AT THAT, HE'S LICKING HIS OWN ASS. WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT? I TELL YOU WHO OBAMA WISHES HE WAS RIGHT NOW, SECRETARY OF STATE KERRY. BECAUSE WHEN THIS WENT DOWN KERRY HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO BE VISITING OUR ALLY FRANCE. KERRY'S TIMING COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER.
THE TIMING COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE. AS. US SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY STEPPED OFF THE PLANE IN PARIS, HE WAS IMMEDIATELY EMBROILED IN AN EMBARRASSING CONTROVERSY BETWEEN FRANCE AND THE U.S..
Jon: OH, WHAT DID WE DO FRANCE, TO CAUSE THE CONTROVERSY? (LAUGHTER) WHAT, DID WE DRINK OUT OF THE BIDET AGAIN? (LAUGHTER) WHAT HAPPENED, DID WE CALL SPARKLING WINE CHAMPAGNE AGAIN? WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, WE JUST DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DID WE MAKE A MOCKERY OF YOUR MOST CHERISHED ATHLETIC EVENT BY HAVING AN AMERICAN WIN IT 7 TIMES IN A ROW THROUGH A SOPHISTICATED BLOOD DOPING SCHEME? THAT LAST ONE WE DID DO, ACTUALLY? IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY SPIED ON MILLIONS OF FRENCH CITIZENS, ACCORDING TO THE LEADING NEWSPAPER LE MONDE.
Jon: OH, THAT. HEHE. AWKWARD. GOOD THING OUR TOP DIPLOMAT IS ON THE CASE.
AT THE END OF A DAY OF RAPID DEVELOPMENTS MR. KERRY OFFERED THIS EXPLANATION.
Jon: KERRY SAID TO THE FRENCH QUOTE NATIONS BE SPYING, YO! THIS AMBASSADOR KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT HE SAID. THIS IS WHAT REALLY WHAT HE SAID.
AS PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID, VERY CLEARLY IN A RECENT SPEECH THAT HE GAVE AT THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, HE SAID WE IN THE UNITED STATES ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE WAY THAT WE GATHER INTELLIGENCE.
Jon: BY REVIEWING THE WAY WE GATHER INTELLIGENCE, WE MEAN FROM NOW ON WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND DO IT SECRETLY. (LAUGHTER) IN OUR DEFENSE, THOUGH, OUR MONITORING 70 MILLION FRENCH CONVERSATIONS WASN'T  ESPIONAGE, IT'S JUST FRENCH PHONE CALLS ARE ALL SO HOT. LIKE A NATIONWIDE SEX LINE, EVEN FRENCH PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS IT'S ALL LIKE OH, MO CHERIE, O, 2.5%  APR,-- YOUR OTHER BANK, YOU MUST NEVER TELL HER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND BY THE WAY, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE  SPYING ON OUR OTHER ALLIES.
IN WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A BLUNT AND EMBARRASSING PHONE CALL TODAY, THE CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY TOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA TO STOP TAPPING HER PHONE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AWKWARD. (LAUGHTER) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY IMPRESSION OF HOW THAT PHONE CALL WENT, HEY, HOW ARE YOU, ANGELA, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU KNOW HOW I AM. IT IS IMPRESSIVE WE MANAGED TO PUT A TAP ON THE ACTUAL CHANCELLOR HERSELF WHO COULD HAVE GOTTEN CLOSE ENOUGH TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I MEAN IT'S-- OH MY GOD! THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. HE WAS-- PLANTING THE BUG, UNBELIEVABLE. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHITE HOUSE, YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO DO WHITE HOUSE.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT ASSURED THE CHANCELLOR THAT THE UNITED STATES IS NOT MONITORING AND WILL NOT MONITOR THE COMMUNICATIONS OF THE CHANCELLOR.
Jon: IS NOT MONITORING, WILL NOT MONITOR. I THINK YOU'RE MISSING A TENSE THERE. YOU GOT YOUR PRESENT PROGRESSIVE THERE AND YOU GOT YOUR SIMPLE FUTURE. BUT YOU'RE MISSING YOUR PAST PROGRESSIVE, AKA THE WE WERE NOT-- WHERE'S YOUR PAST PROGRESSIVE TENSE, JAY CARNEY? BY THE WAY, THAT JOKE BROUGHT TO YOU BY GRAMMER. GRAMMER--  (APPLAUSE) YEAH GRAMMAR, IT'S THE RULES WHAT MAKE YOUR MOUTH FEEL DUMB. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT SO, PAKISTAN, FRANCE AND GERMANY MIGHT HAVE A FEW TINY REASONS TO BE MAD AT US. WE CAN GET BACK FROM THIS.
IN MEXICO MANY REMAIN ANGRY OVER REPORTS THE NSA HACKED INTO THE FORMER MEXICAN PRESIDENT'S E-MAIL.
THE BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT SAID SHE WAS FORCED TO POSTPONE A PLANNED TRIP TO THE U.S. FOLLOWING REPORTS THE NSA SPIED ON HER PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS.
COMPLAINTS FROM NEARLY 40 OTHER COUNTRIES OVER REVELATIONS THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY HAS BEEN SPYING ON THEIR INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS.
Jon: AWKWARD. SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, WE HAVE A PROBLEM? WE'RE SOMEHOW ADDICTED TO PARANOID SNOOPING ON EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING AROUND US. HOW DARE YOU! I'M SO OFFENDED! I BID YOU GOOD DAY! BUT AS A PARTING GIFT IF I COULD JUST LEAVE THIS RIGHT HERE-- IT'S JUST A-- IT'S AN INNOCUOUS TOASTER. DON'T USE IT, JUST WHEN YOU ARE SAYING THINGS, IF YOU COULD MAKE TOAST, WE WOULD, REST OF THE WORLD MEET ME AT CAMERA 3.
SEE GUYS, YOU ARE ALL UPSET WE ARE SPYING ON YOU AND DRONE STRIKING YOU AND YOU ARE REALLY UPSET BUT I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION. HAVE YOU MET US? MEDDLING INTO YOUR AFFAIR FOR OUR NATIONAL SELF-INTEREST IS KIND OF OUR THING. WHAT PART OF EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE SINCE THE MONROE DOCTRINE DON'T YOU GET. I MEAN BUGGING YOUR PHONES IS PRETTY WEAK TEA FOR US. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH CIGAR SHRAPNEL CASTRO IS STILL PULLING OUT OF HIS ASS. BESIDES, IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T DOING ANYTHING TO YOU THAT THEY AIN'T DOING TO US. SEE, RIGHT THERE,  BOOM, THEY'RE SPYING, GET THIS. THEY'RE SPYING ON OUR STUDIO, AND I'M LITERALLY SAYING THAT INTO A CAMERA THAT IS GOING TO BROADCAST. IT SEEMS KIND OF REDUNDANT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW-- OKAY, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THAT ONE. DIDN'T-- DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THAT ONE. SO LOOK, WORLD. YOU WANT AN APOLOGY? FINE. WE'RE SORRY. THAT YOU FORGOT THAT WE ARE KIND OF DICKS. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT? ALL NATIONS ACT IN THEIR OWN SELF-INTEREST. DON'T ACT LIKE YOUR [BLEEP] DON'T STINK, IT DOES. AND WE KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE A SUPERSECRET PROGRAM THAT IT GOES THROUGH. BY THE WAY, GERMANY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO EASE UP ON THE-- EVERYTHING YOU EAT AND DRINK. (LAUGHTER)
FRANCE, YOU DON'T LIKE OUR HUBRIS NOW, YOU SURE LIKED IT WHEN YOU HANDED OFF THE VIETNAM WAR-- COULD YOU HOLD THIS WAR FOR US A LITTLE BIT. WE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO IN ALGERIA, AND PAKISTAN, YOU KNOW THAT SOME THOSE DRONE STRIKES WERE AT YOUR REQUEST. AND BY THE WAY, WHEN WERE YOU GOING TO TELL US THAT BIN LADEN WAS CRASHING ON YOUR COUCH. AND YOU, GERMANY, YEAH, YOU--  (LAUGHTER) DO I REALLY HAVE TO JUSTIFY MYSELF TO A COUNTRY THAT INVADED POLAND BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT POLAND WAS LOOKING AT THEM FUNNY? SO GET OVER IT OR BETTER YET, TURN THAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWNMENT DON'T THINK OF US AN AN OVERLY AGGRESSIVE PARANOID SUPERPOWER, THINK OF US AS WHAT ANYONE'S LOOKING FOR IN A PARTNER. A GOOD LISTENER (LAUGHTER) A GREAT LISTENER. THE BEST LISTENER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. SO BEFORE YOU SAY THANK YOU, I WOULD ONLY ASK ONE THING. CAN YOU SAY IT A LITTLE CLOSER TO THAT TOASTER? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
