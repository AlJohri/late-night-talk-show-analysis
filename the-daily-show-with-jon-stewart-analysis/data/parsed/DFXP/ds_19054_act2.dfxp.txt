Jon: WELCOME BACK. WHEN A NEWS STORY FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS, LEWIS BLACK CATCHES IT FOR A SEGMENT WE CALL "BACK IN BLACK." ♪  ♪
THE WINTER OLYMPICS HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET BUT I'M ALREADY SURE THEY ARE GOING TO BE ONE HOT MESS. IT KICKED IN LAST WEEK WHEN I SAW THE CEREMONIAL 2014 UNIFORMS FOR TEAM USA. THAT LOOKS LIKE A CARDIGAN. [BLEEPED] THE AMERICAN FLAG WITH LEE GREENWOOD'S (bleep). THE GAMES ARE BEING HELD IN SOCHI, RUSSIA, AND IT TURNS OUT THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE BEST CHOICE.
A TOWN BEST KNOWN AS A BEACH RESORT. IT'S IN THE WARMEST PLACE OF RUSSIA ON THE BLACK SEA.
THOSE ARE PALM TREES NEXT TO THE BRAND NEW SPEED SKATING ARENA. IT'S A RUSSIAN  CLUB MED. IT'S LIKE HOLDING THE INTERNATIONAL BACON FESTIVAL IN IRAN. WHAT POSSIBLE JUSTIFICATION DID RUSSIA HAVE TO PICK SOCHI? SOCHI IS ONE OF PRESIDENT PUTIN'S FAVORITE VACATION SPOTS.
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT RUSSIAN CORRUPTION THEY DON'T EVEN TRY TO HIDE IT. THE ONLY THING IN RUSSIA MORE EXPOSED THAN THEIR CORRUPTION IS THE PRESIDENT'S NIPPLES. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THE OLYMPICS ARE A CELEBRATION OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT AND A SHOWCASE OF WORLD UNITY.
THREE COUNTRIES GET E-MAILS WARNING OF A TERRORIST THREAT AT THE SOCHI WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES.
SOCHI 250 MILES FROM TERROR HOTBED CHECHNYA.
250 MILES FROM CHECHNYA? EVEN TRIPADVISOR KNEW THAT WAS A BAD IDEA. [LAUGHTER] WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL? I'M SURE EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE.
THE U.S. MILITARY HAS PLANS TO PUT TRANSPORT PLANES AT EUROPEAN BASES ON ALERT AND IS DEPLOYING TWO NAVY SHIPS TO THE BLACK SEA IN CASE AMERICANS NEED TO BE EVACUATED.
I HOPE THE LEE GREENWOOD (bleep) SWEATERS ARE MADE OUT OF KEVLAR. AND FINALLY LET'S NOT FORGET ANOTHER LITTLE PROBLEM RUSSIA IS HAVING WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE THESE DAYS.
IN JUNE RUSSIA PASSED LAWS THAT BANNED PROMOTING GAY RIGHTS AND PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION BY SAME-SEX COUPLES.
HOW DID THE MAYOR FEEL ABOUT GAY PEOPLE IN SOCHI? WE DON'T HAVE THEM IN OUR TOWN.
I SHOULD KNOW I'VE (bleep) EVERY GUY IN SOCHI AND NOT ONE OF THEM SEEMED TO ENJOY IT. JON?
Jon: THANK YOU, LEWIS. LEWIS BLACK, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
