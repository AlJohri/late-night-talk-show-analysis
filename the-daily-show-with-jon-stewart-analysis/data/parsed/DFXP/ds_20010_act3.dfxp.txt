[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK! OH, WE'RE VERY EXCITED, OUR GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW FILM OUT, IT'S CALLED "BIRDMAN."
GET HIM THE [BLEEP] OUT OF MY PLAY. I'M NOT GOING TO STAND UP THERE.
IT WAS A PREVIEW. NOBODY GIVES A [BLEEP] ABOUT A PREVIEW. NOTHING MATTERS UNTIL THAT OLD BAT FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES IS SITTING IN THAT AUDIENCE OPENING NIGHT.
WE ARE GETTING RID OF HIM. I DON'T GIVE A [BEEP] --
SHUT UP, JUST SHUT UP, AND LISTEN TO ME FOR ONCE. AS SOON AS WE ANNOUNCED HE WAS TAKING OVER THE ADVANCE DOUBLED AND THAT TOOK LESS THAN A DAY. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THE PREVIEW, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE ANYMORE MONEY. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE MIKE. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT, THIS IS ABOUT BEING RESPECTED AND VALIDATED, AND REMEMBER, THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME. THAT'S HOW YOU GOT ME INTO THIS [BEEP]! NOW YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR, GET THEM UNDER CONTROL, OKAY.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, ZACH GALIFIANAKIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU, YOUNG MAN.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU? THIS, THIS, INARRITU, THE DIRECTOR OF THIS MOVIE IS SUCH A BRILLIANT MAN. BUT THIS MOVIE, THE PERFORMANCES HE BRINGS OUT OF YOU GUYS. THE TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT OF IT. IT, IT'S INCREDIBLE PIECE OF WORK.
GOOD, SO YOU GOT MY TEXT ABOUT WHAT TO SAY?
Jon: YES.
OKAY.
Jon: I'M READING THAT OVER YOUR, OVER YOUR SHOULDER RIGHT THERE.
SO THEY JUST TEXTED IT TO THERE. OKAY. Jon: AND YOU ZACH, YOU ZACH ARE AMAZING!
RIGHT. Jon: THERE WE GO. THERE WE GO.
YEAH, IT'S A MOVIE THAT -- YOU DON'T GO TO A LOT OF FILMS THESE DAYS WHERE YOU LEAVE AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT FOR SO LONG. I SAW IT LAST WEEK. I -- IT'S JUST BEEN ON MY MIND CONSTANTLY. IT'S ONE OF THESE KIND OF --
Jon: WELL, YOU'RE IN IT. YOU'RE ONE OF THE GUYS IN IT. IS THAT WHAT WAS ON YOUR -- DID YOU THINK LIKE THAT GUY LOOKED LIKE ME?
YEAH. Jon: IS THAT WHAT STUCK WITH YOU?
YEAH, THAT GUY LOOKS JUST LIKE ME.
Jon: HE LOOKED A LOT LIKE YOU.
YEAH, THE GUY IN THE CLIP.
Jon: YES.
BUT, IT IS -- IT IS, IT IS, I MEAN, IT'S HARD TO BE IN A MOVIE AND BRAG ABOUT IT.
Jon: YEAH.
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS GROSS TO DO THAT. BUT IT IS, IT IS A GREAT -- HAVE YOU SEEN IT?
Jon: I'VE SEEN IT -- BUT IV'E SEEN IT AT A FESTIVAL IN VERY THIN OXYGEN. IT WAS IN TELLURIDE.
TELLURIDE.
Jon: IT WAS ABOUT 15,000 FEET. SO, I THINK I LIKED IT. I THINK I BLACKED OUT A FEW TIMES AS IT WAS GOING THERE. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS IN A GONDOLA WITH A BEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. NO, HERE'S WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ABOUT IT ALSO. JUST TECHNICALLY FOR THE ACTORS, THE CAMERA MOVES IN IT ARE ASTONISHING. BUT IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE AS ACTORS THAT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN EASY.
NO. I MEAN, IT'S, THE TAKES WERE LIKE SOMETIMES UP TO TEN MINUTES OR MAYBE FIFTEEN. SO IF YOU ONLY HAVE 20 SECONDS AT THE END OF A TAKE AND YOU'RE NOT A VERY -- NOT A VERY ACCOMPLISHED ACTOR.
Jon: OR, OR OR HAVE LEARNED YOUR LINES.
OR KNOW ANYTHING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. WHEN THEY HAND YOU THE BATON IT CAN BE REALLY LIKE  I THINK EVEN THE SOUND GUY PROBABLY HEARD ME GO, OH GOD, HERE THEY COME, HERE THEY COME. YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF THING. SO, IT'S -- IT'S, I'M REALLY PROUD OF IT. IT'S THIS KIND OF BIZARRE WEIRD MOVIE --
Jon: THAT'S AWESOME.
THAT EVERYBODY KIND OF GOES WOW IT WAS BIZARRE AND WEIRD BUT WOW.
Jon: YEAH.
SO, I HOPE -- IT COMES OUT IN ONE THEATER IN THE UNITED STATES.
Jon: AND THIS THEATER HAS ONLY ONE SEAT. YOU HAVE TO WAIT.
IT'S IN TULSA.
Jon: OR YOU CAN DO IT IN LAPS. BUT THIS YEAR, MAN. WHEN DID YOU GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO TAPE BETWEEN TWO FERNS WITH THE PRESIDENT.
I THINK THAT WAS LAST SPRING IN THE SPRING. YEAH.
Jon: WAS THAT THE WEIRDEST THING YOU'VE EVER DONE? LIKE, DID YOU -- WHEN -- HOW DID THAT -- DID THE PRESIDENT CALL YOU AND SAY, ZACH, I REALLY LIKE YOUR SHOW. COME TO MY HOUSE.
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT WENT DOWN.
Jon: REALLY?
NO. I THINK WE HAD TALKED TO HIS PEOPLE ABOUT --
Jon: HE'S GOT PEOPLE?
YEAH, HE'S GOT TWO GUYS. [LAUGHING] JUST TWO.
Jon: AN AGENT, A MANAGER. THAT'S HOW IT GOES.
YEAH, MARCUS AND CHUCK. [LAUGHING]
BUT SO, YA, I MEAN WE -- I CHATTED WITH HIS CHIEF OF STAFF, VALERIE JARRETT ABOUT IT. AND THEN, WE SOMEHOW WE, I ENDED UP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND I'M LIKE IS THIS, THIS AIN'T HAPPENING, YOU KNOW? AND THEN, SO -- BEFORE WE WENT TO INTERVIEW THE PRESIDENT I ATE IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH HIS, WITH HIS STAFF. YOU KNOW, THE YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT EIGHT OF THEM. SIX TO EIGHT OF THEM.
Jon: WHAT DO THEY HAVE LIKE A CAF? THEY JUST HAVE LIKE A  CAFETERIA?
THERE'S A RESTAURANT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S CALLED --
Jon: IS IT AN ARBYS?
I DID GET DIARRHEA. [LAUGHING]  Jon: THEY'RE THE NICEST PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE KEEP BRINGING THEM UP THAT WAY.
DO THEY REALLY BRING YOU FOOD? ARBY'S? Jon: THEY REALLY BRING US FOOD, THEY BRING US ALL THE TIME. THE GUY IS THE NICEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. THE FOOD IS, I DON'T KNOW -- IT'S, IT'S OKAY.  YOU KNOW, IT HASN'T HURT ANYBODY. AND EVERYBODY SEEMES VERY HAPPY TO HAVE IT. AND YET WE CONTINUE WITH THIS BIZARRE -- IT WAS REALLY ONLY BECAUSE ALPHABETICALLY, ARBY'S IS FIRST. THAT'S WHY WE WENT WITH IT.
YEAH, THAT'S WHY YOU WENT -- IT JUST WAS THE FIRST THING. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH ARBYS IF THEY'RE LISTENING. [LAUGHING]
Jon: SO, YOU EAT WITH THE STAFF.
SO I EAT WITH THE STAFF.
Jon: THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE.
IT'S A RESTAURANT. I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY.  BUT THERE ARE LIKE WAITERS AND A DESSERT MENU.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND ON THE DESSERT MENU THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED CHOCOLATE FREEDOM. [LAUGHING]
Jon: NO. NO, THERE'S NOT.
YEAH. Jon: CHOCOLATE FREEDOM.
AND, I SAY TO THE STAFF, NOT TRYING TO BE FUNNY,  YOU GUYS CALL THE PRESIDENT THAT, RIGHT? [LAUGHING] RIGHT? THINKING I WAS GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE FOR SAYING THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID, YOU HAVE GOT TO ASK HIM THAT. I WAS LIKE, NO. SO IT WAS VERY, VERY FUN.
Jon: I OFTEN KNOW WHERE A LOT OF THESE LITTLE STORIES ARE GOING AND ALL THAT, NOT BECAUSE THERE'S PRE-PRODUCTION BUT BECAUSE YOU FIGURE WITH A COMIC YOU KNOW. DIDN'T KNOW THAT'S WHERE THAT WAS GOING.
YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT? Jon: DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS WHERE THAT WAS GOING. SO PLEASED THAT'S WHERE IT WENT.
OH GOOD, GOOD. Jon: REALLY, REALLY FUNNY, AND THE MOVIE IS GREAT. AND YOU'RE GREAT IN IT. "BIRDMAN," THEATERS ON FRIDAY. ONE THEATER, TULSA.
TULSA. Jon: AND THEN IT'S EVERYWHERE. ZACH GALIFIANAKIS, VERY NICE.
