WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, BESTSELLING AUTHOR, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, HIS NEW DOCUMENTARY IS CALLED "KORENGAL."
THIS ONE'S FOR YOU, AMERICA.
FOR A WHILE THERE, I STARTED, I STARTED THINKING THAT GOD HATES ME. AND LIKE I SAID, I'M NOT RELIGIOUS OR ANYTHING, BUT I FELT LIKE THERE WAS THIS HATE FOR ME BECAUSE I DID SINS, YOU KNOW, I SINNED.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM SEBASTIAN JUNGER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SIR. HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
I'M GOOD.
Jon: GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
YOU TOO.
Jon: I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEE YOU IN ONE PIECE.
YEAH, ME TOO. ME TOO.
Jon: SO THAT, IT'S INTERESTING. AT THE END OF THAT CLIP, SO THAT GENTLEMAN WHO WAS TALKING, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HE FELT THAT GOD HATES HIM. AS THAT CONTINUES, HE SAYS, BUT THE THING I HATE MOST IS WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME, HEY, MAN, YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.
YEAH. WHAT HE HATED ABOUT THAT IS HE FELT LIKE IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO END THE CONVERSATION. SOLDIERS FEEL THAT CIVILIANS SEND THEM TO WAR. IT'S NOT THE SOLDIER'S WAR, IT'S OUR WAR, AND THEN THEY COME BACK, AND THE MORAL PROBLEMS OF WAR, THE CIVILIANS DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT. AND SO THEY SAY, YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO, CAN WE STOP TALKING ABOUT IT. THAT'S WHAT HE HATES ABOUT IT.
AND HE EVEN SAID, HE SAID, LOOK, I DIDN'T DO WHAT I HAD TO DO, I CHOSE TO DO IT. I'M, I'M A SOLDIER. I VOLUNTEERED. AND, IT'S VERY INTERESTING. THIS IS... YOU SEE THE CAMARADERIE AND THE LOVE THESE GUYS HAVE FOR EACH OTHER, AND THEY'LL EVEN SAY IT EXPLICITLY, WE WERE FIGHTING FOR EACH OTHER.
YEAH.
ALMOST ENTIRELY.
JUST ABOUT ENTIRELY. AND, I MEAN, WHAT'S CONFUSING TO THEM IS THEY COME HOME, AND THEY FIND THAT THEY MISS IT, THAT THEY MISS THE COMBAT.
RIGHT. >>IT'S CONFUSING TO THEM. IT'S REALLY CONFUSEING TO THEIR WIVES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO DO IN THIS FILM IS TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION: WHAT IS IT THAT THEY'RE MISSING? AND A LOT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ADRENALINE. THERE'S, YOU KNOW, ALL THIS SORT OF YOUNG MAN STUFF YOU CAN SEE IN THE FOOTAGE, BUT THERE IS ALSO THIS INCREDIBLE BROTHERHOOD.
RIGHT.
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY COME HOME TO A SOCIETY HERE WHERE PEOPLE ARE SHOOTING EACH OTHER IN SCHOOLS EVERY DAY. IT'S A VERY ALIENATED SOCIETY, AND FRANKLY, THEY SEE IT REALISTICALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN THEY COME HOME.
Jon: HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO SEE OR IDENTIFY ANY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY EFFECTIVE IN REINTEGRATING SOLDIERS IN A WAY THAT IS NOT JUST... BECAUSE THE GENERAL THING YOU HEAR IS, LOOK, WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR HELP. WE'RE LOOKING TO HELP.
YEP.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER MISSION. PREFERABLY WITHOUT AS MUCH GUNFIRE, BUT...
PEOPLE LIKE TO FEEL USEFUL.
Jon: YES.
RIGHT? SO, THERE IS A GROUP CALLED TEAM RUBICON. IT TAKES VETS AND PUTS THEM INTO NATURAL DISASTERS, THAT KIND OF THING.
RIGHT.
YOU REMEMBER HURRICANE SANDY IN NEW YORK.
SURE.
AND EVERYONE KIND OF BANDED TOGETHER AND THEY WERE HELPING EACH OTHER. AND IN A WEIRD WAY PEOPLE LOOK BACK ON DISASTERS WITH A KIND OF NOSTALGIA. THAT'S HOW SOLDIERS LOOK BACK ON COMBAT.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO IF WE CAN BRING THEM HOME, BASICALLY IF WE CAN OPERATE IN MORE OF A COMMUNITY WAY, THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED, BUT FRANKLY, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.
YEAH, I CAN'T, YOU KNOW, IT ALWAYS BLOWS MY MIND. YOU HAVE ALL THIS... WE HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS AT HOME. THEN WE HAVE THIS ENORMOUS AND TALENTED FIGHTING FORCE, AND YOU FEEL LIKE, WELL GEEZ, THEY'VE BEEN NATION BUILDING IN AFGHANISTAN WHERE PEOPLE DIDN'T NECESSARILY WELCOME THEM, WELL, I BET CHICAGO WOULD.
YEAH. YEAH.
I BET CHICAGO WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THESE VERY TALENTED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE USED TO WEARING HELMETS AND FLAK JACKETS. AND START REBUILDING THIS COUNTRY.
WELL, YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION. LIKE WHAT IS ALL OF US, LIKE WHAT IS OUR DUTY TO OUR COUNTRY? OTHER THAN PAYING OUR TAXES? IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE? RIGHT? AND, IF THERE IS, SOME KIND OF NATIONAL SERVICE, YOU KNOW... I MEAN, LIKE...
Jon: YES. NATIONAL SERVICE, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I'M TOO OLD. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S EXCELLENT.
IT REALLY WOULD UNIFY THE COUNTRY A LITTLE BIT.
Jon: WHY DON'T WE? YOU KNOW, I MEAN, UNFORTUNATELY THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING IS IN VERY SHORT RESERVE, BUT I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF NATIONAL SERVICE, BUT NOT NECESSARILY MILITARY.
NO. NO. THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU COULD HAVE A COMPONENT OF IT THAT IS STATE SIDE. I THINK IT WOULD BE...
MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY, LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE ARMY, BUT I'M GLAD TO HELP IN CHICAGO. IT'S GREAT IDEA.
Jon: WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP SAYING "CHICAGO," BUT...
OKAY. DETROIT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OR, I MEAN, ALL AROUND. THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY IS, WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS, DECREPIT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN IGNORED FOR 20 TO 30 YEARS BECAUSE OF POLITICAL IN-FIGHTING, BUREAUCRATIC COMPLACENCY. ALL THESE THINGS THAT WITH THAT RIGHT MISSION FOCUSED ETHIC COULD REALLY BE TACKLED IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY. AND I THINK THESE SOLDIERS WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY.
I THINK THEY WOULD. AND, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, LIKE THEY SPEND A YEAR ON A REMOTE HILLTOP LITERALLY SLEEPING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER, AND THAT EXPERIENCE OF CONNECTION AND INTIMACY IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE. AND, IF YOU CAN USE THAT BACK HOME, YOU CAN GET ALMOST ANYTHING DONE.
Jon: I WONDER TOO, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SEE THAT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT BOWE BERGDAHL AND HOW THE UNITS ARE REACTING, YOU CAN SEE HOW WITHIN THAT UNIT THERE IS MAYBE ALMOST NOTHING YOU CAN DO THAT IS AS BAD AS WALKING AWAY FROM YOUR BROTHERS.
ABSOLUTELY.
OR YOUR SISTERS.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: IT SEEMS LIKE, YOU COULD SEE THEIR ANGER BEING INDELIBLE.
YEAH. I MEAN, I WAS, YOU KNOW, I WAS OUT THERE OFF AND ON FOR A YEAR, AND ONE OF THE, I MEAN, ONE OF THE GREATEST SINS IS FALLING ASLEEP ON GUARD DUTY. YOU MAKE A MISTAKE AND EVERYBODY CAN DIE. AND SO WHEN YOU WALK OUT OF AN OUTPOST. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID EXACTLY, OBVIOUSLY NONE OF US DO YET, BUT...
Jon: NOBODY DOES.
BUT THE IDEA OF ABANDONING YOUR POST,
YEAH.
YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE NOT BREAKING MILITARY RULE. THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM. YOU'RE ABANDONING YOUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR BROTHERS WHO ARE DEPENDING ON YOU. THAT'S A VERY SERIOUS THING.
Jon: IN YOUR MIND, GIVEN THAT BROTHERHOOD, IF SOMEONE WERE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WOULD THAT UNIT STILL WANT TO GET THAT PERSON BACK HOME? IS THAT ETHIC RUN, EVEN IF THEY FEEL WRONGED? DO YOU THINK... IT'S A RIDICULOUS HYPOTHETICAL.
I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHY HE WALKED OUT ON THE WIRE. HE SPOKE PASHTU. IF HE WALKED OUT THE WIRE TO TRY AND MAKE PEACE WITH THE LOCALS, THEY MIGHT HAVE SAID, YOU KNOW, THAT'S INSANE, THAT WAS STUPID, BUT, COME ON BACK IN, DON'T BE THAT STUPID AGAIN. IF HE REALLY ACTUALLY WANTED TO LEAVE THEM, THEY WOULDN'T WANT HIM BACK, I DOUBT.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. IT'S A FASCINATING MOVIE AGAIN. AND YOUR ABILITY TO GET IN THERE AND UNDER THE SKIN OF IT ALL IS REALLY I THINK WHAT MAKES IT I THINK SO SPECTACULAR. WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO NEXT? I'M HOPING YOU'RE GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE SAFER.
I'M OFF TO CAPE COD.
Jon: [LAUGHTER] LET ME SAY THIS: DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. "KORENGAL" PLAYING IN NEW YORK. IT'S GOING TO OPEN IN LOS ANGELES ON FRIDAY, NATIONWIDE THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER. SEBASTIAN JUNGER, THANK YOU.
