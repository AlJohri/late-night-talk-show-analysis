(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN TALKING  A LOT ABOUT REPUBLICAN  EFFORTS TO REACH OUT TO  MINORITY COMMUNITIES. BUT THEY AREN'T THE ONLY  ONES. ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE  COUNTRY IS CHANGING. FOR INSTANCE, THE WALT  DISNEY CO.. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S VERY AMUSING. LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,  THE DISME COMPANY HAS  RECENTLY BEEN TRYING TO  REACH OUT TO LATINOS. WHICH VERY SIMILAR RESULTS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY  ANGRY ABOUT THIS, DISNEY HAS  SAID TO MAKE A NEW MOVIE AND THEY WANTED TO TRADEMARK THE  PHRASE DIA DELOS MURTOS OR  DAY OF THE DEAD BUT THERE WAS HUGE BACKLASH AND  TONIGHT DISNEY IS BACKING  DOWN SAYING THEY WILL GIVE  THE MOVIE A DIFFERENT TITLE.
Jon: REALLY? PEOPLE WERE ANGRY THAT  DISNEY TRIED TO TRADEMARK  THE HOLIDAY ON WHICH THEY  PRAY FOR THE SOULS OF THEIR DAED FAMILY AND FRIENDS? I MEAN-- IT'S NOT LIKE  DISNEY WASN'T GOING TO LET  THEM HONOR THEIR DEAD. IT'S JUST THAT WHENEVER THEY  Z THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY,  YOU KNOW, ROYALTIES. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THE  COMPANY BACKED DOWN BECAUSE  THEY KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO CONSUMER DEMAND. LIKE WHEN THEIR PIXAR  DIVISION MADE BRAVE WHICH  FINALLY FEATURED A PRINCESS  WHO WAS AN INDEPENDENT, REALISTIC LOOKING TEENAGER  WHO JUST THIS WEEK ACTUALLY  GOT A BIG DISNEY HONOR.
THE REDHEADED HEROIN WILL  BE CROWNED DISNEY'S 11th PRI  SES TOMORROW BUT-ON A  SECOND. MERIDA HAS UNDERGONE A  MAKEOVER, AN EXTREME ONE  SOME SAY FOR HER BIG DAY  COMPLETE WITH A SLIMMED DOWN LOOK, WITH WIDER EYES AND A  NEW GLAMOROUS HAIR-DO.
Jon: COME ON, THE WHOLE  MESSAGE OF BRAVE WAS THAT  GIRLS DON'T HAVE TO FIT IN WITH SOCIETY'S EXPECTATIONS. IF THEY WERE IN A SORORITY  TOGETHER NEW MERIDA WOULD BE  TELLING OLD MERIDA, IF YOU DON'T STOP BEING SO [BLEEP] AWKWARD AND BORING I WILL  LITERALLY [BLEEP] PUNT YOU. I WILL [BLEEP] PUNT YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I DON'T KNOW HOW TO  TAKE YOUR APPLAUSE ON THAT. (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR  MODIFICATION THAT IS NOT  GOOD FOR COMEDIAN TO GO. LIKE WHEN I SAY-- PUNT [BLEEP] PUNT THEY CLAP. CUT TO JON STEWART ARRESTED  ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK  WANDERING AROUND YELLING [BLEEP] PUNT. THE COMEDIAN REPLIED I'M  ONLY LOOKING FOR APPLAUSE. THEY EVEN TOOK AWAY MERIDA'S  BOW AND ARROW. HOW IS SHE SUPPOSED TO KILL  THE TRIBUTES FROM DISTRICT  2. THAT'S THE SAME MOVIE, ISN'T  IT? I'M SURE I'M RIGHT [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU  PEOPLE? (LAUGHTER)  SO WHAT DOES DISNEY HAVE TO  SAY FOR ITSELF?
WE REACHED TOUT DISNEY  FOR A COMMENT. HERE IS THE STATEMENT THEY  PROVIDED US SAYING QUOTE  MERIDA EXEMPLIFIES WHAT IT  MEANS TO BE A DISNEY PRINCESS THROUGH BEING BRAVE,  APPROXIMATIONATE AND  CONFIDENT.
Jon: YEAH. AND LITERALLY LYING IN A  COMA WAITING FOR A MAN TO  GIVE YOU LIFE. WE HAVE SEEN THOSE MOVIE,  DID I SAY LITERALLY, I MEANT  LIGHT-RALLY. WAIT A SECOND, I BET THEY  WERE THINKING THE OTHER KIND  OF DISNEY PRINCESS. BECAUSE THAT NEVER TURNS OUT  WELL EITHER. YEAH. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S GOING TO BE ALL OVER  THE INTERNET TOMORROW. (LAUGHTER)  DO WE REALLY NEED TO  PIXELATE THAT? IF WE UNUNPIXELATE THAT,  WHAT ARE WE REALLY GOING TO  SEE. RAINBOW? (LAUGHTER)  BAMBI'S HEAD? OH, REALLY? [BLEEP] PUNT IS FINE? [BLEEP] PUNT IS FINE BUT  DON'T BRING UP BAMBI, THAT  IS OVER THE LINE, STEWART! (LAUGHTER)  SO FAR NEARLY 200,000 PEOPLE  HAVE SOUND A PETITION ON  CHANGE.ORG TO KEEP THE OLD MERIDA AND TO LEGALIZE POT. THAT'S JUST AUTOMATICALLY  ADDED TO EVERY INTERNET  PETITION. AND IN RESPONSE DISNEY  ASSURED THE PUBLIC THAT  WHILE YES THE NEW MERIDA  WILL APPEAR ON SOME MERCHANDISE, THE ORIGINAL  MERIDA WILL STILL EXIST. AND THAT REALLY MERIDA JUST  WANTED TO DRESS UP FOR HER  CORONATION CEREMONY. BECAUSE THEY THINK WE'RE [BLEEP] IDIOTS. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM  HERE IS, MERIDA WAS NEVER A  DISNEY CHARACTER, SHES WITH A PIXAR CHARACTER. AND I KNOW DISNEY OWNS PIXAR  BUT IT IS NOT THE SAME THAT  IS WHY-- LOOKS LIKE THIS AND NOT THIS. THAT IS WHY JESSE FROM "TOY  STORY" WEARS CHAPS AN NOT A  BALL GOWN AND WHY HOLY  SHIFTWELL FROM CARS 2, WELL, WHO [BLEEP] CARS ABOUT CARS  2 BUT THE POINT IS THIS,  DISNEY, YOU NEED TO  RECONSIDER THIS MAKEOVER BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN  ARRANGEMENT WITH THE PARENTS  OF AMERICA OF WHICH I AM ONE. OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THE  CHILDREN ARE SITTING IN  FRONT OF THE SCREEN. (LAUGHTER)  YOUR JOB IS TO RAISE THEM  RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  AND IF YOU KEEP TEACHING  THEM THE WRONG LESSONS, THEN  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO START DOING IT OURSELVES AND  THAT'S NOT COOL. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHTS BACK.
