(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK! WITH THE WIDE-OPEN ELECTION  HEADING INTO ITS FINAL WEEK, ARE  EVEN THE CANDIDATES' MOST  RELIABLE VOTING BLOCK UP FOR  GRABS? JESSICA WILLIAMS HAS MORE.
AS WE KNOW, 95% OF AFRICAN  AMERICANS ARE VOTING FOR  PRESIDENT OBAMA. BUT HOW DO MORMONS FEEL ABOUT  MITT ROMNEY? I HEADED TO UTAH TO FIND OUT. OKAY, THANK YOU, GUYS, FOR  MEETING UP WITH ME. (LAUGHTER)  UM -- I'M HERE TO TALK TO  MORMONS.
WE ARE ALL MORMONS.
WE ARE.
OH, MY GOD. YES, BLACK MORMONS.
WE ARE ALL MEMBERS OF THE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS.
OH, MY GOSH. SOMEONE MAKE A FORTUNE OF THIS  (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  THEY WERE LIKE MYTH KL CREATURES  THE UNICORNINGS OF POLITICS. IS THIS ALL YOU GUYS?
NO, HEAVEN'S NO.
NO.
THERE'S QUITE A FEW HERE IN  THE VALLEY IN SALT LAKE.
FOUR OR FIVE MORE?
NO, THERE ARE MORE THAN YOU  WOULD IMAGINE.
THESE AND THE 17 OTHER BLACK  MORMONS EMBODY THE CENTRAL  QUESTIONS FACING VOTERS THIS  ELECTION.
IT'S CONFUSING. LIKE DO YOU VOTE FOR THE BLACK  GUY, DO YOU VOTE FOR THE MORMON  GUY?
WE'RE IN A POSITION THAT NO  OTHER PEOPLE IN AMERICA CAN BE  IN ELECTION.
SEEING THE FIRST BLACK  AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT WAS  EXCITING. MITT ROMNEY, MR. ROMNEY, BROTHER  ROMNEY, WE ARE OF THE SAME FAITH  AND I LIKE HIM
HOWEVER WHICH WAY YOU GUYS  VOTE YOU GUYS ARE GONNA WIN?
YES. (LAUGHTER)
BUT THEN YOU GUYS ARE  DEFINITELY ALL GONNA LOSE, TOO. SO WHO DO YOU CHOOSE? OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO DO A QUICK  TEST TO FIND OUT IF YOU'RE MORE  BLACK OR MORE MORMON. SO, LYNN, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT  THE FACT THAT THE MORMON CHURCH  DIDN'T REALLY FULLY ACCEPT  AFRICAN AMERICANS UNTIL ABOUT  1978?
MOST CHURCHES HAVE RACISM IN  THEIR HISTORY.
I'M JUST GONNA GO AHEAD AND  COUNT THAT AS MORMON.
OKAY.
FINISH THIS SENTENCE "THE  ROOF, THE ROOF, THE ROOF IS ON  FIRE --"
WE DON'T NO WATER LET THE  ROOF JUST BURN!
OKAY, THAT'S PRETTY MORMON. (LAUGHTER)
THE THING IS, YOU CANNOT PUT  US IN A GLASS JAR. WE'RE AMERICANS WHO HAPPEN TO BE  BLACK AND HAPPEN TO BE MORMON.
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M REALLY SORRY THAT I KIND OF  TRY TO PUT EVERYBODY INTO A BOX.
I AGREE.
OKAY, NOW HOW DOES THE BLACK  PART OF YOU FEEL ABOUT MY  APOLOGY?
I ACCEPT IT.
OKAY, NOW HOW DOES THE MORMON  SIDE OF YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
SAME WAY, EXACT SAME WAY.
WITH THE MARGINS RAZOR THIN  EVERY VOTE COUNTS. SO I WAS GOING TO HELP THIS  RAREST OF PEOPLE COME TO A  DECISION. ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S TALK ABOUT  BLACK MORMON ISSUES, OKAY? LIKE, UM --  (LAUGHTER)  UM -- THE GOOD NEWS IS BLACK  MORMONS ARE JUST LIKE THE REST  OF US.
OBAMA, I LIKE HIS POSITION ON  HEALTH CARE. HEALTH CARE UNDER OBAMA IS A TAX
CAN YOU PLEASE REFER TO HIM  AS PRESIDENT OBAMA? I MEAN, SHOW HIM SOME RESPECT, I  MEAN GOODNESS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU'RE SAYING HOW DO I LIKE  WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE IS  JACKED UP THE DEBT.
AIN'T IT INTERESTING THAT THE  REPUBLICAN GUY BACK THERE IS THE  ANGRY BLACK MAN? (LAUGHTER)
AND LIKE THE REST OF US, THIS  ELECTION IS TEARING THEM APART.
THIS GUY SOUNDS JUST LIKE A  WHITE REPUBLICAN.
HE DIDN'T WIN BECAUSE OF HIS  SKIN COLOR.
HE DIDN'T WIN BECAUSE HE HAD  A BEATER TEAM THAT GOT ON THE  INTERNET --
YES, HE DID.
I THINK YOU'RE SELLING  AMERICA SHORT.
NO.
GUYS, THERE'S SO FEW OF YOU. THERE CAN'T BE BLACK MORMON  AGAINST BLACK MORMON.
WHY CAN'T WE?
YES, NO MATTER WHO THEY VOTE  FOR THESE BLACK MORMONS ARE JUST  LIKE EVERY OTHER AMERICAN--  ARGUMENTATIVE AND INTOLERANT OF EACH OTHER'S VIEW POINTS.
I'M NOT BEING CONTENTIOUS,  I'M JUST SAYING.
