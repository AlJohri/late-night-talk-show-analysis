Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT THE HEAD COACH  FOR THE NEW YORK FOOTBALL GIANTS  HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "EARN THE RIGHT TO WIN."  PLEASE WE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  TOM COUGHLIN. SIR -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU. HAVE A SEAT. NICE TO SEE YOU.
GREAT CROWD.
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS ON ALL  YOUR SUCK SENCHES APPRECIATE  THAT, JON DIFFERENT ON ALL YOUR  SUCCESS.
APPRECIATE THAT, JON.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED  "EARN THE RIGHT TO WIN."  YOU ARE A HEAD FOOTBALL COACH YOUR JOB IS TO MOTIVATE, ON THE  PRO LEVEL, GUYS MAKING MILLIONS  OF DOLLARS, USED TO BE TREATED A STEUP STAR. HOW DO YOU MOTIVATE THEM?
IT'S A PROCESS, THERE'S NO  QUESTION ABOUT THAT PLAYERS  WANT -- AT EVERY LEVEL THEY WANT TO LEARN. THEY WANT TO BE THE BEST THEY  CAN. THEY WANT TO BE COACHED. THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS INCENTIVE  OBVIOUSLY. THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE IS  THE GREATEST PLAYERS IN THE  WORLD. MOTIVATION IS A PROCESS WAS  PRIDE FIRST AND SETTING GOALS  AND ATTACKING THOSE GOALS. ONCE THE SEASON STARTS YOU START  WITH YOUR DIVISION, YOU START  WITH YOUR 16 GAME SCHEDULE BUT IT'S A WEEKLY PROCESS WE CALL IT  EARNING RIGHT TO WIN.
Jon: HOW DO YOU GET THE  GUYS TO BUY IN. YOU ARE LIKE THIS IS ABOUT  PREPARATION, GUYS? I DON'T FEEL LIKE PREPARING.
THAT HAPPENS A COUPLE OF  TIMES. ONCE IN A WHILE BUT YOU HAVE TO  HAVE YOUR FINGER ON THE PULSE OF  FOOTBALL TEAM. YOU SURROUND YOURSELF IN A  SITUATION.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU DO IF A  BAD FOOTBALL PLAYER MARRIES INTO  YOUR SNAM DO YOU HAVE TO PLAY THEM FOR THE SAKE OF  THANKSGIVING?
HE DOESN'T GET IN THE FAMILY  IF HE IS A BAD FOOTBALL PLAYER.
Jon: SMART. YOU HAVE TO SET RULES.
LAY IT OUT.
Jon: WHAT STRIKES ME IS IT  REALLY IS APPLICABLE IN ANY --  YOU TALK ABOUT STRUCTURE. I THOUGHT, WE RUN A STUPID SHOW,  WRITING A BUNCH OF JOKES BUT  WITHOUT STRUCTURE WE'RE LOST. THE SAME THING IN TERMS OF YOUR  PREPARATION, YES?
ABSOLUTELY. WE CALL IT EARNING RIGHT TO WIN. YOU HAVE TO HAVE ORGANIZATION,  MOTIVATION, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE  TO COMMUNICATE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE ALL OF THESE  THINGS. THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT A FOOTBALL  BOOK IT'S A BOOK ABOUT LIFE.
Jon: YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT  EVERYTHING. IT'S DOWN TO THE SHADE PATTERNS  AT THE STADIUM AS THE SUN IS  GOING --
RIGHT.
Jon: YOU ARE CALCULATING,  PREPARING DOWN TO WHERE THE SUN  MAY SET AT CERTAIN TIMES IN THE  DAY.
CERTAIN TIMES IN OF THE DAY.
Jon: FOR YOUR TEAM.
FOR YOUR TEAM TO KNOW WHERE  WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE. TALKING TO THE SPECIAL TEAMS  ABOUT THE WIND, HOW ARE THE  KICKERS? HOW ARE THEY KICKING AND  PERFORMING INTO THE WIND? AGAINST THE WIND? DO WE WANT THE RECEIVERS LOOKING  INTO SUN OR THE DB'S LOOKING  INTO THE SUN? AT WHAT POINT IN THE GAME? ALL THOSE THINGS ARE CALCULATED.
Jon: DO ALL TEAMS PREPARE  IN THAT MATTER? THE KNOCK ON CERTAIN TEAMS, LAST  TWO MINUTES OF THE GAME,  SURPRISING THINGS HAPPEN AND YOU SEE THE OTHER TEAM LOOKING  AROUND AND THEY HAVE TO BLOW A  COUPLE OF TIMEOUTS. THEY FORGET WHAT IS GOING ON,  THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO CALL  ANOTHER PLAY. IF YOU DON'T PREPARE LIKE THAT,  IS THAT IN THE CRUNCH TIME AREAS  OF THE GAME SNL.
THAT'S WHAT YOU PREPARE FOR  ALL OF THESE SITUATIONS. WHY YOU HAVE STRUCTURE IS SO YOU  CAN HANDLE THEM. WHY YOU HAVE LEADERSHIP, WHY YOU  DRILL. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO  BE SUCCESSFUL. WE'RE THE NUMBER ONE TEAM IN THE  LEAGUE THIS YEAR IN THE  TWO-MINUTE DRILL AND IT'S NOT BY  ACCIDENT.
Jon: ARE YOU WORRIED THAT  THE OTHER COACHES MIGHT THINK TO  HIMSELF THAT GUY COUGHLIN HAS WON A COUPLE SUPER BOWLS. LET ME LOOK AT THAT REAL QUICK. PREPARATION.
INTERESTING, HUH.
Jon: DO YOU KEEP THE  SECRETS? ARE THERE SPECIAL SAUCE  INGREDIENTS YOU ARE NOT LAYING  OUT THERE?
THOSE THOUGHTS ARE AT ANOTHER  LEVEL. THIS IS HOW TO DO IT, IF WILL  YOU AND HOW TO BE THE BEST YOU  CAN BE.
TALENT, EVALUATION, ALL THAT. I COULD THREAD BOOK. I COULD PREPARE -- I COULD READ  THIS BOOK. I COULD PREPARE AND FIGURE OUT  THE ANGEL OF THE SUN BUT I  OBVIOUSLY HAVE OSTEOPOROSIS AND I WOULD NOT. CHRIS AND OTHER BALL PLAYERS,  FOR ME, I STILL MAY HAVE TROUBLE  GETTING OPEN.
THAT'S IT.
Jon: HOW IMPORTANT IS THE  KEY POSITIONS. YOU HAVE ELI MANNING  QUARTERBACKING THE OFFENSE. GREAT GUYS LIKE BLACKBURN AND  MICHAEL STRAHAN, HOW IMPORTANT  IS IT FOR EACH OF THE UNITS ON A FOOTBALL TOMORROW TO ALSO HAVE  LEAD YEARS LONG WITH THE HEAD  COACH?
VERY IMPORTANT, VERY, VERY  IMPORTANT. WHAT WE STARTED A COUPLE YEARS  AGO IS WHAT WE CALLED A  LEADERSHIP COUNT. WE HAD MICHAEL STRAHAN, ELI  MANNING, PLAYERS FROM EACH  POSITION. I WANTED THESE PLAYERS TO TAKE  MY MESSAGE AND GO TO THE  INDIVIDUAL MEETING ROOMS, THE OFFENSIVE LINE, DEFENSIVE LINE,  THE QUARTERBACK.
Jon: PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE  THE AMOUNT OF STUDY THAT GOES  INTO FOOTBALL. IT'S INCREDIBLE.
Jon: STRAHAN IS BLOWING UP  AS A PERFORMER. WAS HIS PERSONALITY EVIDENT LIKE  THAT?
IT'S A MAGNETIC PERSONALITY,  A LEADER. WHAT HE ACCOMPLISHES AND DOES --  NOTHING SURPRISE ME WITH MICHAEL  STRAHAN.
Jon: ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT  THE SEASON COME UP?
I AM.
Jon: HOW -- I WENT TO ONE  LIVE FOOTBALL GAME. I BROUGHT MY SON AND WE WERE  LUCKY ENOUGH TO GO TO THE LOCKER  ROOM AND YOU WERE GIVING A  SPEECH. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO YOU GIVE  A MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH TO PEOPLE  IN THEIR UNDERWEAR.
A NUMBER OF YEARS.
Jon: YOU WERE LIKE GUYS  GOTTA STAY FOCUSED AND YOU'RE  LIKE, --
WE GOT 52 POINTS THAT DAY.
Jon: I HELPED BY TURNING MY  BEER BOTTLE THE RIGHT WAY. IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT.
THE SUN ANGLE WAS BIG.
Jon: IT'S A PLEASURE SIR. I'VE BEEN A FAN OF THE TEAM  SINCE THE 19 60'S. YOU'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH. EARN THE RIGHT TO WIN IT'S RIGHT  HERE. TOM COUGHLIN. GET IT NOW AND GO SEE A NICE  GAME. YOU KNOW -- [CHEERS
