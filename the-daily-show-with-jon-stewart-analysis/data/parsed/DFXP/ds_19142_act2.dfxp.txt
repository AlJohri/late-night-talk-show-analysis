[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. SUMMER 2014. SO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, TIME TO CHECK IN ON THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RACE, SPECIFICALLY KENTUCKY SENATOR AND PROSPECTIVE G.O.P. CANDIDATE RANDFORD J. PAUL, THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2016: COIF TO THE RACES EDITION.
RAND PAUL LAUNCHES A 10-STOP TOUR OF IOWA TODAY.
IT IS HIS 10TH VISIT TO THE STATE THIS ELECTION CYCLE.
WHICH HAS PROMPTED MANY TO WONDER IF HE'S CONSIDERING A BID FOR THE PRESIDENCY.
Jon: WHAT? NO. IT COULD BE... NO, MAYBE HE LOVES IOWA. HE'S GOT A THING FOR STRAWBERRY POINT, IOWA'S WORLD'S LARGEST STRAWBERRY. WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT A REAL STRAWBERRY. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAD A REAL 15-FOOT STRAWBERRY OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT IMPRESSIVE. IT'S A REALLY 15-FOOT FIBERGLASS SCULPTURE. AND I MEAN, WE DON'T ADVERTISE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AS THE WORLD'S LARGEST LADY. TRUTH IS ELLERBE, NORTH CAROLINA HAS A LARGER FAKE STRAWBERRY, SO I JUST, YOU KNOW... NO. NO. I DON'T THINK... I DON'T THINK I... I WAS NOT... I WAS POKING GENTLE FUN. THAT'S SOMEWHAT BETTER. THAT IS... THAT IS MORE FRUIT APPROPRIATE, BUT STILL SOMEWHAT HYPERBOLIC. ALL RIGHT. BUT IS SENATOR PAUL UP FOR THE CHALLENGES OF A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY? IT'S A ROUTINE TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY, ESPECIALLY FOR A CANDIDATE WHO HAS SOME UNPOPULAR POSITIONS.
RAND PAUL WAS ASKED A QUESTION, SOMEONE GETS A LITTLE UPSET WITH HIM, SAYING HEY, YOU'VE PROPOSED TO CUT OFF U.S. AID TO ISRAEL. RAND PAUL SAYS, NO I DIDN'T.
I HAVEN'T REALLY PROPOSED THAT IN THE PAST. WE'VE NEVER HAD A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TO DO THAT.
Jon: GEEZ, IF YOU NEVER PROPOSED CUTTING OFF U.S. AID TO ISRAEL, THAT'S WEIRD. I'M NOT SURE WHY HE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT. OH, WHAT'S THAT? OH ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST TEN YEARS WORTH OF FOREIGN AID, ISRAEL GETS JUST SLIGHTLY MORE THAN JORDAN AND EGYPT GET TOGETHER. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, PARTICULARLY WHEN WE HAVE TO BORROW THE MONEY FROM CHINA. SHOULD WE BE GIVING MONEY, FREE MONEY OR WELFARE TO A RICH NATION?
Jon: THAT IS WHY YOU NEVER MAKE EYE CONTACT ON THE SUBWAY. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE SOME CRAZY-HAIRED DUDE IS JUST GOING TO DRAW YOU INTO AN AWKWARD CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. AND YOU DON'T WANT NONE OF THAT. BUT, ALL I HEARD THERE WAS SOMEBODY RAISING QUESTIONS, INDULGING IN HYPOTHETICALS. HE NEVER PRECISELY SAID END ALL FOREIGN AID TO ISRAEL.
ALRIGHT, SO JUST TO BE PRECISE, END ALL FOREIGN AID, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN AID TO ISRAEL AS WELL, IS THAT RIGHT?
YES. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A MARK. SO HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO END THE AID, BUT HE NEVER PUT IT IN A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL, EXCEPT FOR HIS 2012 BUDGET PROPOSAL, AND REALLY THAT BUDGET PROPOSAL DOESN'T COUNT ANYWAY.
I HAVE NEVER INTRODUCED ANY LEGISLATION THAT TARGETED ISRAEL IN ANY WAY.
Jon: DIDN'T EVER TARGET IT. ISRAEL WAS COLLATERAL DAMAGE. IN RAND PAUL'S INDISCRIMINATE TARGETING OF FOREIGN AID IN GENERAL. I GOT TO SAY, SENATOR, ALL THIS FUMBLING AROUND DOESN'T MAKE YOU LOOK GOOD. NOW YOU TOOK A POSITION. YOU SHOULD STAND BY IT. STICK THE LANDING HERE TO SHOW US YOU'VE GOT THE INTEGRITY. SAY SOMETHING, ANYTHING TO PERSUADE US THAT YOU ARE, LIKE YOUR POP, PRESIDENTIAL MATERIAL.
YOU WANT TO ACCURATELY PORTRAY MY POSITION?
Jon: YES. THAT IS WHAT WE WANT BECAUSE IF YOU CAN ACCURATELY PORTRAY YOUR POSITION WE CAN JUST TAKE THOSE RAND PAUL FOR PRESIDENT BUMPER STICKERS AND JUST LIKE DRAW A LINE ON THE O AND ADD A D AND WE DON'T HAVE TO SPEND ANY MORE MONEY TO SUPPORT YOU. WE WANT TO BE ACCURATE.
YOU WANT TO WRITE AN ARTICLE THAT I'VE SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS TRYING TO PUT CONDITIONS ON AID TO PEOPLE WHO HATE US AND BURN OUR FLAG.
Jon: I LIKE WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS. I ALSO HATE PEOPLE WHO HATE US AND BURN OUR FLAG.
THEN IT WOULD BE AN ACCURATE STORY. AND YOU CAN PUT AS A SIDELINE IN THERE THAT I'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THAT EVERY COUNTRY ULTIMATELY WOULD BE BETTER OFF TO BE INDEPENDENT.
Jon: BOOM! AND YOU COULD ILLUSTRATE THAT ARTICLE WITH A PHOTO OF MY HEAD ON HUGH JACKMAN'S BODY STANDING IN THE OVAL OFFICE. CONGRATULATIONS, MR. NEXT PRESIDENT, YOU'VE DONE IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
