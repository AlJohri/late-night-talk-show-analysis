CUTLER MADE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT  DICK CHENEY AND -- [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] -- DID YOU GUYS JUST GET REALLY  COLD? [LAUGHTER] FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TOP  STORY TONIGHT, THE FRAGILE  ECONOMY. ECONOMIC GROWTH IS STAGNATED. UNMYMENT IS STUB BORNLY HIGH AND  BY MIDNIGHT TOMORROW THE  SPENDING CUTS, SEQUESTER, CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT  SUBJECTED THEMSELVES TO TO FORCE  THEM TO MAKE A DEAL BEFORE THE SEQUESTER TOOK EFFECT BECAUSE  THE EFFECTS WOULD BE SO DRASTIC  AND DIRE THAT IT'S TAKING  EFFECT.

HOPE AND OPTIMISM HERE ON  WALL STREET.
MERGER MANIA IS BACK.
THE HIGHEST BUBBLE SINCE  2005.
MERGER MANIA IS BACK WITH A  VENGEANCE.

OFFENSE DEPOT AND OFFICE MAX  ARE MERGE.
AND HIGHER BUSCH AND GROUPO  MODELO.
WARREN BUFFETT IS BUYING  HEINZ.
Jon: JIFFY POP AND JIFFY  LUBE. THE TWO OFFICE COMPANIES MAKES  SENSE, NOT SO CLEAR ON WHY  BUFFETT AND HEINZ ARE GETTING  TOGETHER. I GUESS IT'S A STRATEGIC VALUE  ADD THE ACQUISITION FOR BUFFETT  TOUR A TERRIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SECRETARY. HE SAID GET ME SOME KETCHUP. SO I GOT YOU A KETCHUP COMPANY. [ LAUGHTER ] THE POINT IS THE FINANCIAL  JOURNALISTS INBRIDLED ENTHUSIASM  FOR THIS MERGER BOOM IS ENTIRELY RATIONAL BECAUSE THERE IS NO AND  NEVER BE A DOWNSIDE.
YOU HAD THE LEVERAGE BUYOUT  BOOM OF 2007. HE HAD THE DOT COM MANIA AND  GOING BACK TO THE 80s THE JUNK  BOND BONANZA. ALL OF THESE ARE MERGER BOOM AS  LONG WITH THEM AND THEY ALL  ENDED BADLY.

[LAUGHTER] SO WHY WOULD THE REST OF -- WITH  THE REST OF ECONOMY STAGNATING  HAS THERE BEEN A SURGE IN MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. IT DOESN'T --
I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION,  JON.
Jon: JOHN HODGMAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE ANSWER, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, FOR LACK OF A BETTER  WORD IS GREEB, GREEB IS GOOD. GREEB IS RIGHT. GREEB WORKS.
Jon: SORRY, I KNOW YOU ARE  DOING A SPEECH FROM WALL STREET  BUT IT SOAND SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE SAYING GREEB WITH A B.
YES, OBVIOUSLY. GREEB, MY FRIENDS CUTS THROUGH  ALL THE.
Jon: JOHN, SIT DOWN FOR A  SECOND. THE GOURDO GECKO SPEECH IN THE  MOVIE IS FAMOUS AND IT'S GREED  WITH A D NOT WITH A B. IT'S NOT GREEB.
CHECK YOUR SHOULDER PADS,  HUMAN LEAGUE, THE 80s ARE  OVER. GREED IS DONE IT THE DID THE ITS  JOB. THE WEALTHY ARE WEALTHIER THAN  EVERY BEFORE. OUR CORPORATIONS CORPORATIONS ARE SITTIN  UNPRECEDENTED HOARDS OF CASH. WE NEED A WORD FOR WHEN YOU WANT  EVERYTHING BUT STILL WANT MORE.
Jon: I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S  STILL GREED.
NOT ACCORDING TO THE  MERRIAM-HODGEMAN DICTONARY.
Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS  MERRIAM-WEBSTER.
I MERGED WIT. I COST ME AN INGROCENEOUS AMOUNT  OF MONEY.
Jon: THAT'S NOT A WORD.
IT WASN'T, IT IS NOW.
Jon: THOSE MERGERS WERE NOT  GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AND NOT FOR  CONSUMERS.
WHO?
Jon: THE CONSUMERS, THE  PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE  ALWAYS RIGHT. THE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE TRYING  TO SERVE.
NO, I DON'T SEE THAT IN HERE. I SEE TERMINATION, CHILD LABOR. THERE'S INGROCENEOUS, OBVIOUSLY  BUT NOT IN THIS ONE.
Jon: IF THESE MERGER AREN'T  GREAT FOR THE ECONOMY WHY ARE  THE FINANCIAL REPORTERS SO EXCITED ABOUT ALL THESE MERGER?
THEY ARE EXCITING, JON. THEY ARE LIKE FUN CORPORATE  WEDDINGS.
Jon: THAT HAS TERRIBLE  FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR  OUR --

Jon: NO, I UNDERSTAND. NOT SURE. [  APPLAUSE  ] -- I'M NOT SURE WHEN THE LAST  TIME WAS YOU WERE AT A WEDDING  BUT A LOT OF THESE MERGERS ARE EVEN BAD FOR THE COMPANIES  INVOLVED.
THAT'S TRUE.
Jon: WHY WOULD THEY PUT  THEMSELVES IN A POSITION WHEREBY  ACQUIRING THESE COMPANIES THEY ARE GOING TO SO BEING INCH  ALMOST TOO BIG.
Jon: RIGHT.
THIS THEY TOO BIG TO FAIL,  THAT'S RIGHT, TBTF, JON. IT'S THE RICH MAN'S YOLO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SOUR SAYING TO ME,  JOHN HODGMAN SITTING HERE WITH  SLICKED BACK HERE IS SAYING TO ME -- [LAUGHTER] ACTUALLY THE POINT FOR THE  CORPORATIONS IS TO GET SO BIG  THAT THEIR FAILURE CREATES A RISK THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T  TOLERATE.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. IT HAS WORKED IN THE PAST. GM,AIG, PIONEERS IN THE FIELD OF  STRATEGIC OVER LARGENESS.
Jon: THIS IS WHAT THEY  DISCUSSED.
MORAL HAZARD IS A LAZY  MOOCHER NORMAL DOESN'T GET A JOB  BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY GET WELFARE OR GOES ON A RECKLESS  LEUKEMIA SPREE BECAUSE HEY,  OBAMACARE HAS IT COVERED. THIS IS TOO BIG TOO FAIL. WHEN RESPONSIBLE CORPORATIONS  RECEIVE CRITICAL CAPITALIZATION  FROM PUBLIC FUNDS TO OFFSET LOSSES FROM FUNDS FAR BEYOND OUR  CONTROL SUCH AS OUR OWN TERRIBLE  DECISION-MAKING.
Jon: I WISH THE WORD  (bleep) WAS STILL IN HERE. IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK THIS TIME  HODGMAN, WE'RE ON TO YOU.
