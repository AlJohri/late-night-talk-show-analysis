Jon: WELCOME BACK. THE PAST FIVE YEARS CONGRESS HAS  MAINTAINED A NEAR FLAWLESS  RECORD OF USELESSNESS. BUT EVEN WITH THEIR TOP  OBSTRUCTIONISTS, THINGS WERE  BOUND TO FALL THROUGH THE  CRACKS. A BRIDGE GETS FIXED UP. EXPANDED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE  GETS PASSED. BUT SINCE THAT SLIP-UP, THE  HOUSE HAS VOTED TO APPEAL OR  DEFUND OBAMA CARE 37 TIMES NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE STUBBORN. THEY HAVE NO SHORT-TERM  MEMORIES. IT'S COVERED. WHILE CONGRESS INHABITS A  FANTASY WORLD WHERE YOU CAN TURN  BACK HISTORY BY WISHING HARD ENOUGH, GOVERNORS LIVE IN ACTUAL  STATES WITH ACTUAL POOR PEOPLE  WHO NEED ACTUAL MEDICAL  ATTENTION. BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT  WE HAD TWO PROGRAMS. ONE WAS MEDICAID. THE OTHER WAS THE EMERGENCY  ROOM. THE FIRST ONE MODESTLY PRICED,  PAID FOR BY THE OTHER. THE OTHER WE PRE-END TEND NOT TO  PAY FOR AND IS THE REASON WHY  ONE ADVIL IS $12,000. MOST OF THE TAB WILL BE PICKED  UP TO EXPAND MEDICARE COVERAGE  IN THE STATE TO COVER MORE  PEOPLE. ALL THE GOVERNORS DO IS HAVE TO  SAY THE MAGIC WORD YES. THUMBS-UP WILL DO. SEEMS LIKE A TOTAL NO-BRAINER  FOR THE GOVERNORS.
ALREADY 15 STATES WITH  REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS WHO SAID  THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICAID EXPANSION.
Jon: THE NO-BRAIN STATES. STATES LIKE TEXAS,  MISSISSIPPI, ALABAMA, SOUTH  CAROLINA.
Jon: KNOWN COLLECTIVELY AS  AMERICA'S HEALTH BELT. REJECTING EXPANDED MEDICAID  MEANS THAT STATES ARE GOING TO  HAVE TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN  PLAN. UTAH IS CONSIDERING CHARITY AS A  REPLACEMENT FOR MEDICAID  EXPANSION. TEXAS JUST WANTS A BAG OF MONEY  WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED. AND OF COURSE IOWA IS GOING WITH  OPTIMISM.
WE'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA IN  IOWA. WE'RE WORKING TO GET PEOPLE TO  TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR OWN  HEALTH. WE'RE FOCUSING ON EXERCISE.
Jon: RIGHT AFTER WE EAT THE  WORLD'S LARGEST FRIED COW-LAMB  ON A STICK. BUT TENNESSEE MAY HAVE FOUND THE  BEST MEDICAID SOLUTION OF ALL. JESSICA WILLIAMS HAS MORE.
STATES ARE SCRAMBLING TO COME  UP WITH ALTERNATIVES TO THE  OBAMA CARE MEDICAID EXPANSION. TENNESSEE HAS A TRULY INNOVATIVE  WAY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF  THEIR NEEDIEST.
IF YOU'RE ELDERLY AND VERY  SICK, TENNESSEE WANTS TO HELP  YOU WITH THEIR MEDICAL BILLS.
THE NEW PROGRAM CALLED  STANDARD SPEND DOWN. IT HELPS PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR OR  EVEN THOSE WHO MAKE TOO MUCH  MONEY FOR MEDICAID.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CALL  A HOT LINE AND IT WILL CLOSE SUN  THEY'VE TAKEN INFORMATION FROM 2500 PEOPLE. BUT BE WARNED. IT IS IS THE SAME NUMBER  THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE WILL  BE CALLING AT THE SAME TIME.
Reporter: YEP. IT'S THE HEALTH CARE LOTTERY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE TENNESSEE  DANDER SPENDDOWN. RATHER THAN ACCEPT FEDERAL MONEY  TO COVER 330,000 UNINSURED THEY  AWARD HEALTH CARE TO ONLY THE FIRST 2500 CALLERS. IT'S LIKE CALLING THE MORNING  FOR TICKETS EXCEPT IF YOU DON'T  WIN YOUR DIABETES GOES  UNTREATED. ENTHUSIAST GINA LUTHER LOVES IT.
WHAT IDIOT COME UP WITH THAT  IDEA? IT'S PLAYING WITH PEOPLE'S  LIVES. LIKE YOU WERE PLAYING A SLOT  MACHINE.
YOU DON'T LIKE SLOT MACHINES? I LOVE SLOT MACHINES. BUT I DON'T LIKE RUSSIAN  ROULETTE.
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY WASN'T  DIALING FAST ENOUGH.
NO, I JUST WASN'T ABLE TO  CALL. I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE HOSPITAL  HAVING SURGERY.
YOU LOSE, GINA. I KNOW THAT AND I DON'T KNOW  WHY IN THIS WORLD THAT THAT  ANESTHESIOLOGIST DIDN'T WAKE ME  UP.
CLEARLY SHE IS JUST A POOR  LOSER. STRATEGIST EXPLAINS WHY THE  STATE IS DOING THE RIGHT THING.
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME  FOLKS IN TENNESSEE. THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR  MEDICAID EXPANSION BUT THEY'RE  NOT BIG FANS OF TENNESSEE REJECTING IT. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM?
I THINK THEY NEED TO  UNDERSTAND THAT TENNESSEE CAN'T  BE EVERYTHING TO EVERYBODY. THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE BUDGET  BALANCE. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT. IS.
THE STATE BUDGET MUST BE  SAVED FROM THE MEDICAID  EXPANSION THAT DOESN'T AFFECT THE STATE BUDGET. I BET ONE OF THE LUCKY 250  WINNERS WILL BE MORE  APPRECIATIVE.
CONGRATULATIONS, YEAH! YOU JUST WON THE TENNESSEE  HEALTH CARE LOTTERY. YOU PERSEVERED CALL A MILLION  TIMES. NOW YOU FINALLY GOT HEALTH  INSURANCE.
NOT. ? WELL, THEY SEND YOU AN  APPLICATION FIRST. YOU FILL OUT THE APPLICATION AND  THEN HE SEND IT BACK IN. THEN YOU WAIT. THEN IT TAKES 90 DAYS TO SIX  MONTHS BEFORE YOU KNOW ANYTHING.
IF YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT, IT  DOESN'T SOUND SO GREAT. BUT WHAT ABOUT LIKE THIS?
WELL, THEY SEND YOU THE  APPLICATION FIRST. YOU FILL THE APPLICATION OUT. THEN YOU SEND IT BACK IN. THEN YOU WAIT.
OKAY. SO HEALTH CARE LOTTERY WINNERS  DON'T ACTUALLY WIN HEALTH CARE. BUT THEY DO WIN A MOUNTAIN OF  PAPERWORK AND SIX MONTHS OF  SUSPENSE.
ANY FOREIGN BANK ACCESS? DON'T. IF YOU THINK THAT IS [BLEEP] UP, DON'T WORRY THERE'S MORE.
3500 WINNERS BUT THE HEALTH  CARE LOTTERY RESERVES THE RIGHT  TO SAY THE CONTEST IS OVER BEFORE ANY CALLS ARE RECEIVED. YES, THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
Reporter: THERE YOU HAVE IT,  A SOLID ALTERNATIVE TO OBAMA  CARE BECAUSE TENNESSEE CONSERVATIVES KNOW YOU CAN'T DO  EVERYTHING FOR EVERYBODY AND  SOMETIMES THAT MEANS DOING NOTHING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED  IT THE MOST. SO KEEP DIALING, TENNESSEE.
Jon: JESS
