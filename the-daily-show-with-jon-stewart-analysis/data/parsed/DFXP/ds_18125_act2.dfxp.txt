[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
John: WELCOME BACK. THE SENATE HAS FINALLY APPROVED  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  REFORM, LEAVING IT UP TOP HOUSE TO PUSH IT THROUGH, WHICH IS  BASICALLY LIKE ASKING YOUR CAT  THE TAKE CARE OF YOUR GOLDFISH WHILE YOU'RE AWAY. NOTHING GOOD IS GOING TO HAPPEN  THERE. SO IS THIS BILL GOING TO BE DEAD  ON ARRIVAL?
TODAY THE REPUBLICAN SPEAKER  OF THE HOUSE SAID IMMIGRATION  REFORM IS NOT DEAD, EVEN THOUGH HE APPEARED TO DRIVE A STAKE  THROUGH THE BIPARTISAN  COMPROMISE PASSED BY THE SENATE.
OH, A STAKE. SO THAT BILL'S NOT DEAD, IT'S  UNDEAD. ACTUALLY, THAT EXPLAINS WHY JOHN  BOEHNER HAS BEEN DRESSING LIKE  BLADE LATELY. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, JEOPARDIZING THE  IMMIGRATION BILL COULD PUT SOME  REPUBLICANS IN A TOUGH SPOT, NOT MORALLY, THEY TRULY DON'T CARE  ABOUT, THAT BUT MUCH MORE  IMPORTANTLY, POLITICALLY.
I BELT REPUBLICANS WHO ARE  THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT IN 2016 MIGHT BE  WORRIED.
THE REPUBLICANS KNOW THEY  NEED THIS. IF YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES, YOU HAVE TO  DO BETTER WITH LATINOS THAN MITT ROMNEY DID.
YOU HAVE TO DO BETTER WITH  LATINOS THAN MITT ROMNEY. OH, THAT'S A LOW BAR, MY FRIEND. THAT'S LIKE SAYING, LOOK, I'M  JUST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING  TASTIER THAN ARBY'S. SO WILL REPUBLICANS PAY A  PENALTY FOR OBSTRUCTING THIS  BILL? WE TURN TO SENIOR LATINO  CORRESPONDENT AL MADRIGAL. AL? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU ARE LATINO. HOW IS THE FAILURE OF THIS BILL  GOING TO AFFECT YOUR VOTE?
JOHN, THAT IS OFFENSIVE. YOU KNOW, I'M SO SICK OF PEOPLE  TREATING LATINOS LIKE SOME  HOMOGENEOUS GROUP THAT ALL FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT EVERYTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS EVEN  OFFENSIVE THAT YOU'D HAVE ME  COVER THIS BECAUSE I'M LATINO.
John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,  WHOA. TO BE FAIR, AL, YOU ARE THE  SENIOR LATINO CORRESPONDENT.
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M ALSO THE JUNIOR LATINO  CORRESPONDENT. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY LATINO  CORRESPONDENT. I'M ON THIS SHOW NOT JUST NOW  BUT ALSO EVER. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALLAH TINOS. STOP ROLLING US ALL TOGETHER  LIKE SOME SORT OF PUEROTO  RICA-MINICAN TEX-MEX BUFFET. LET ME EXPLAIN. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CHART. SEE, THESE ARE THE TOP ISSUES  FOR A GROUP I'M REFERRING TO AS  "ALL PEOPLE."  NOW COMPARE THAT TO THE TOP ISSUES FOR LATINO PEOPLE.
John: HOLD ON. HOLD ON. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. CAN WE JUST LOOK AT THOSE TWO  CHARTS TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT  SEEMS TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME  CHART.
YEAH, BUT OURS IS IN A  SPICIER FONT AND IF YOU ZOOM IN  A LITTLE, YOU'LL SEE OURS INCLUDES ULTIMATE FIGHTING AND  PIGEON RACING.
John: SURE, SURE, I GET IT. BUT LET'S BE FAIR FOR A SECOND  NOW. EVEN IF THERE IS DIVERSITY AMONG  LATINO, YOU GUYS ARE STILL  POLITICALLY IDENTIFIED AS ONE  GROUP.
BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE. THAT'S LIKE LUMPING ALL  EUROPEANS TOGETHER. WHAT IF I CALLED YOU IRISH?
John: HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,  HEY, THAT'S OFFENSIVE. WE ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THERE  IS ALSO SOME COMPLICATED HISTORY  BETWEEN US. WE DON'T LOOK ALIKE. WE DON'T SOUND ALIKE.
WHAT IF I SAID YOU WERE  EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FRENCH.
John: OH, REALLY? YOU TAKE THAT BACK OAR I WILL  CUT YOUR FACE OFF. OH, I GET IT. I GET IT. I GET IT.
SEE. THANK YOU. OKAY. THAT IS HOW A PUERTO RICAN FEELS  WHEN YOU CALL HIM DOMINICAN OR  HOW A PANAMANIAN FEELS WHEN YOU CALL HIM HONDURAN. LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU. I WENT OUT ON THE STREET AND I  SPOKE TO REAL LATINOS ABOUT HOW  THEY FEEL ABOUT OTHER LATINOS.
LATINOS ARE ALL THE SAME  EXCEPT FOR, YOU KNOW, LIKE THE  MEXICANS REALLY.
I USUALLY HAVE ISSUES WITH  LIKE ARGENTINIANS.
DOMINICANS AND PUERTO RICANS  DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPEAK SPANISH.
I DON'T DIG THOSE CHILEANS. THEY LOVE MAYONNAISE.
CHILEANS LOVE MAYONNAISE.
CHILEANS LOVE MAYONNAISE.
THAT'S A REASON NOT TO LIKE  THEM?
THAT'S A BIG REASON.
I THINK GUATEMALANS HAVE A  FUNNY NAME TO BEGIN WITH. WHEN HE WAS LITTLE, HE SAID IT  FUNNY.
LIKE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER.
I'VE HAD THE SAME JAR OF  MAYONNAISE IN MY REFRIGERATOR  FOR LIKE TWO YEARS.
HAVE A CHILEAN IN THERE. IT WILL BE GONE IN LIKE TWO  DAYS.
I'VE GOT TELL YOU, AL. I HAD NO IDEA THE SITUATION WAS  THAT SERIOUS.
YEAH, THE CHILEAN MAYONNAISE  THING IS CRAZY. THIRD PER CAPITA IN THE WORLD  FOR MAYO CONSUMPTION AFTER  RUSSIA AND THE U.S. CLEARLY THESE CRAZY CHILEANS  THINK THE SECRET TO BECOMING A  WORLD SUPERPOWER IS JUST EATING  MAYONNAISE. DO WE NEED A MAJOR INDUSTRY OR A  STRONG MILITARY? NO, JUST KEEP EATING MAYONNAISE  AND WE'LL BE NUMBER ONE. BESIDES, WHY ARE WE ALWAYS  TRAPPED IN THESE MINES? DO WE HAVE ANY FISH TO EAT  BESIDES SEA BASS.
John: AL, I'VE GOT TO STOP  YOU. THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OFFENSIVE.
YES! THAT'S MY POINT. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO FRUSTRATING  WHEN PEOPLE SAY LATINOS CAN'T  ASSIMILATE HERE IN AMERICA. THEY ALREADY HAVE THE MOST  IMPORTANT PART DOWN -- HATE LAG  TINOS.
John: SO YOU'RE SAYING  STOPPING THE IMMIGRATION BILL  WON'T NECESSARILY HURT REPUBLICANS BECAUSE THEY CAN  APPEAL TO LATINOS ON OTHER  ISSUES.
NOT REALLY. WE'LL HOLD A GRUDGE AND NEVER  FORGET THAT, BUT I DO KNOW HOW  REPUBLICANS CAN KEEP OUT CHILEAN  IMMIGRANTS. JUST SEND THEM MORE MAYONNAISE.
THAT'S TRUE. YOU PEOPLE DO LOVE YOUR  MAYONNAISE, HUH? WHAT? HEY, HEY!
RELAX. RELAX. JUST CALM DOWN.
DID YOU JUST CALL ME CHILEAN,  FRIEND CHI? JON YAWN WHAT!
