[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT STARS ON ABC'S MODERN FAMILY HIS NEW MOVIE IS CALLED MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN.
PEABODY THAT WAS AMAZING. WASN'T THAT AMAZING?
I'M MORE INTO ROCK 'N' ROLL. ♪  I MEANT FLAMENCO. ♪  BAGPIPES ♪ THIS IS GREAT BUT A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. LET'S GET PENNY AND GO --
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME TY BURRELL. HELLO, SIR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU. I HAVE TO SAY THAT -- THE MALE IN THAT CLIP WAS ONE STEPHEN COLBERT.
Jon: WHAT?
YES AND HAS THERE EVER BEEN A CHARACTER IN ANIMATED HISTORY WHO HAS LOOKED MORE LIKE THE ACTUAL PERSON EVER. HE SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN CALLED MR. COLBERT.
Jon: HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED THAT. HE HAS SUCH A FLEXIBILITY OF FACE. I WOULD THINK HE IS AN ANIMATOR'S DREAM.
YES, BECAUSE THEY FILM YOU.
Jon: WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO WORK WITH STEPHEN COLBERT.
WE GOT SO CLOSE. JUST THE TIME BETWEEN SCENES AND GOING OUT TO DINNERS I'VE NEVER MET STEPHEN COLBERT.
Jon: WHAT?
I HAVE STILL NEVER MET STEPHEN COLBERT. THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S 100% TRUE. I'VE SEEN HIM IN PASSING BUT I'M REALLY HOPING TO MEET HIM AT THE PREMIERE. NO EYE CONTACT.
I DON'T THINK THE SECURITY WILL LET THAT -- HE HAS  FRUITY AND BIG FRUITY.
HE HAS FRUITY AND BIG FRUITY? THAT'S HOW THEY TELL THEM APART. EDDIE MURPHY HAD A SECURITY TEAM AND TWO GIGANTIC GUYS AT A PREMIERE ONCE HE SAID THIS IS FRUITY AND BIG FRUITY.
BIG FRUITY IS BIGGER.
Jon: AND NOT MUCH. I'M A PEABODY AND SHERMAN AFICIONADO.
YOU ARE.
Jon: AS A YOUNG MAN I WOULD WATCH PEABODY AND SHERMAN AND ALWAYS THOUGHT IT HAD POSSIBILITIES FOR A FEATURE LENGTH FILM. [LAUGHTER] IT'S THAT OLD HOLLYWOOD SCREENPLAY TROPE:  GENIUS DOG ADOPTS A BOY AND BUILDS HIM A TIME MACHINE TO TEACH HIM HISTORY. SEE IT AGAIN.
Jon: I ALWAYS SAID TO MYSELF COMMANDER McBRAGG, NO THAT'S NOT A FILM. SHERMAN AND PEABODY IT'S A FILM. IT'S VERY GOOD. IT'S SMART. YOU SEE SOME OF THESE ANIMATED FILMS YOU GO WITH YOUR KIDS AND YOU CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE. THIS ONE VERY SMART, VERY FUNNY.
THANK YOU. I GENUINELY AGREE. THE GUY WHO CREATED THE ORIGINAL SAID THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO WRITE THEM TO AMUSE YOURSELF WHICH HE DID. I THOUGHT THE ORIGINALS WERE SO GREAT.
THEY WERE GREAT.
I THINK THEY DID A NICE JOB OF DOING THE SAME THING.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS:  THIS CONFOUNDED ME WHEN I WAS READING YOU ABOUT YOU. YOU WERE FROM WHERE YOU GREW UP IN OREGON?
OREGON.
Jon: YOU ARE A METS FAN. AS ARE YOU.
Jon: I'M A HUGE METS FAN BUT I'M CURSED BY BIRTH.
I KNOW.
Jon: MY FATHER WAS FROM BROOKLYN AND WHEN THE DODGERS LEFT.
HE WAS LIKE GUESS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE?
Jon: RIGHT. NOT THAT HE DIDN'T IMPART ON ME DIMENTIA  AND GOITERS BUT THAT IS THE ONE INHERITANCE. HOW DID YOU GET SUCKED INTO THAT ABYSS?
I LIVED IN ASTORIA QUEENS FOR 12 YEARS. YES IT EXISTS.
Jon: DID YOU THINK THAT WAS ALMOST TOO ENTHUSIASTIC FOR ASTORIA QUEENS. MY WIFE AND I NOTICED THERE'S NO METS HATS IN QUEENS. IT'S ALL YANKEES. WE ADDED TWO PEOPLE TO THE TURNOUT OF 1300 PER GAME. IT'S NOW 1302.
Jon: I USED TO GO THE LAST WEEK OF THE SEASON BECAUSE YOU REALLY DO HAVE THE RUN OF THE PLACE.
YOU ARE RUNNING AROUND THE SEATS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IT'S LIKE THAT FILM NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM WHERE YOU GO IN -- [LAUGHTER] AT MIDNIGHT I HEARD THE TEAM COMES ALIVE.
YOU ARE ON THE FIELD.
Jon: YOU CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT. BUT YOU STILL, EVEN NOW, YOU STAYED WITH IT. IT STAYED WITH YOU.
YEAH, YEAH. IT'S A DISEASE OF BEING AN ETERNAL OPTIMIST. I THINK THE METS ARE WINNING A WORLD SERIES EVERY YEAR. AND I'M 0-FOR MANY, MANY OF THOSE YEARS.
Jon: THEY WIN IT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN. A DISEASE IS A PERFECT --
THE TERRIBLE THING IS -- WE WERE LIVING IN QUEENS IN LIKE 2002, 2003 -- I HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED ANY OF THAT. ENDY CHAVEZ BROUGHT US SO CLOSE.
Jon: HE BROUGHT THAT CATCH IN AND I THOUGHT THIS IS DESTINY AND HE STRIKES OUT AND GOES TO THE YANKEES AND HELPED THEY WIN A WORLD SERIES. (bleep). MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN IN THE THEATERS MARCH 7. IT'S QUITE GOOD. TY BURRELL, EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
