Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
John: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY  SHOW."  I'M JOHN OLIVER. I AM STILL IN FOR JON STEWART  WHO IS SCOURGE COMPETING TO BE  AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL. OH, NO, THEY VOTED HIM OUT! THEY VOTED HIM-- DON'T LISTEN TO  THEM, JON. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL ON THE INSIDE! AND THERE IS NO SHAME BEING MORE  CATALOG THAN EDITORIAL. THAT'S A FACT. MY GUEST TONIGHT THE WRITER,  DIRECTOR, AND STAFFER A VERY  FUNNY NEW MOVIE "IN A WORLD" LAKE BELL WILL BE HERE. VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD. BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH  BREAKING NEWS.
THE BIG CHILL BETWEEN THE  U.S. AND RUSSIA MAY BE HEADING  FOR THE DEEP FREEZE. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS OFFICIALLY  CANCELED HIS ONE-ON-ONE MEETING  WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN.
John: CANCELED? WOW, THAT'S A BIG DIPLOMATIC  SLAP IN THE FACE, A DIP MOVE, IF  YOU WILL. ( LAUGHTER )  ALTHOUGH IF THE PRESIDENT REALLY  WANTED TO HURT PUTIN HE WOULD  HAVE SAID HE WAS COMING AND JUST STOOD HIM UP. TRUST ME, THAT HURTS A LOT MORE. OR IF YOU WANTED TO BE MORE  PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE THE PRESIDENT  COULD HAVE SAID LET'S MEET SOMEWHERE THAT'S NOT TECHNICALLY  IN RUSSIA LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,  MOSCOW AIRPORT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  LOOK, WE ALL KNOW-- WE ALL KNOW  WHY THIS MEETING WAS CANCELED,  RIGHT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA FORMALLY  CANCELED NEXT MONTH'S MEETING IN  MOSCOW WITH RUSSIA'S PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. WHY?
MISSILE DEFENSE, HUMAN  RIGHTS, THAT CONTROVERSIAL LAW  THERE THAT BANS GAY RELATIONSHIPS AND A LOT OF  CONCERN ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO  IMPACT THE OLYMPICS IN SOCHI.
John: OH, THAT'S RIGHT  BECAUSE RUSSIA WILL NOT ALLOW A  HINT OF HOMOSWULLITY IN AN EVENT WHERE YOU EITHER WIN A  SKIN-TIGHT LEOTARD OR SPARKLY  TUXEDO FOR YOUR ICE BALLET. COME ON, COME ON, NOW. IS THERE NOTHING ELSE THAT LED  AMERICA TO THIS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS CANCELLING  HIS MEETING WITH RUSSIA'S  PRESIDENT PUTIN OVER TENSIONS BECAUSEst N.S.A. LEAKER  EDWARD SNOWDEN.
John: YES, THAT IS CLEARLY  THE ONLY REASON. IT'S-- IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA  TO PAD OUT WITH WHAT YOU REALLY  WANT TO SAY WITH SELF-RIGHTEOUS HUMAN RIGHTS STUFF LIKE,  "KIMBERLY, WE NEED A BREAK. I DON'T LIKE YOUR STANCE ON  CHINE AND TIBETAN MONKS AND YOUR  BOOBS ARE WEIRDING ME OUT." IF WE WANT SNOWDEN BACK ALL WE  NEED TO DO IS CONVINCE VLADIMIR  PUTIN THAT SNOWDEN IS GAY. THAT AWAY WAYHE'LLOB A PLANE  INTO U.S. CUSTODY FASTER THAN A  DEFINITELY NOT HOMOEROTIC TEAM OF ELASTIC CLAD MEN. THAT QUICK. ACTUALLY, RUSSIA IS NOT ONLY  GLOBAL LEADERSHIP STORY WE'RE  DEALING WITH TONIGHT WHICH BRINS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT... INDEED. NOW, WE'VE ALREADY DEALT WITH  RUSSIA, SO LET'S SEE WHERE OUR  MAGICAL DPLOAB WILL TAKE US NEXT  EGYPT! EGYPT. I JUST LIFT EGYPT. I'M NOT-- I'M NOT USED TO GUNS. ( LAUGHTER )  AS THE SITUATION IN EGYPT  CONTINUES TO DEVOLVE, THE U.S. LIKE A POLAR BEAR ON A HASTILY  MELTING GLACKIER IS TRYING TO  ACT LIKE EVERYTHING'S STILL  COOL. ( LAUGHTER )  A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, WE  DISCUSSED HOW, DUE TO AN  UNHELPFUL U.S. LAW WE ARE UNABLE TO CALL THE EGYPTIAN MILITARY  TAKEOVER OF THEIR GOVERNMENT A  COUP BECAUSE IF WE UTTER THE DIPLOMATICALLY OFFENSIVE "C"  WORD WE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE  TO SEND EGYPT AID, OUR ONLY NONMISSILE-BASED MOVE. DON'T WORRY. SINCE THEN WE'VE COME UP WITH AN  INGENIOUS SOLUTION.
LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE US TO  MAKE A FORMAL DETERMINATION. THAT IS A REVIEW WE HAVE  UNDERGONE, AS TO WHETHER COUP  TOOK PLACE AND IT IS NOT IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST TO MAKE SUCH A  DETERMINATION.
John: YSHES BECAUSE YOU  FORGOT. OUR OTHER. ILOMATIC MOVE. THE LAW SAYS WE HAVE TO CUT OFF  AID IF THERE IS A COUP, BUT IT  DOESN'T SAY WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT A COUP IS. IGNORANCE AND DIPLOMATIC BLISS. CLEARLY, THIS IS A VERY DELICATE  SITUATION, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND  LINGUISTICALLY, AND THAT IS�� WHY�r THE WHITEH%USE DISPATCHED ITS  "A" TEAM.
REPUBLICANS JOHN McCAIN AND  LINDSEY GRAHAM THROUGH TO CAIRO  AT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RIDICULOUS.
John: I'M SORRY, DID I SAY  DISPATCHED THEIR "A" TEAM? THEY DISPATCHED A TEAM.   ( APPLAUSE ). LET'S BE FAIR, THESE ARE TWO  VERY SEASONED POLITICIANS. ALL THEY REALLY HAVE TO DO IS  NOT SAY THE WORD "COUP."
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE  FORMER GOVERNMENT PRESIDENT'S  REMOVAL WERE A COUP.
John: NAILED IT! ANOTHER LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR  NEXT COUNTRY. AND WHO IS IT? YES. ITALY! THE COUNTRY'S BEEN GRAPPLING  WITH TWO PROBLEMS RECENTLY, A  SPHIERALLING ECONOMY AND WHAT TO DO WITH THE FORMER LEADER WHO IS  RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.
THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER IS  NO STRANGER TO SCANDAL.
CHARGES OF BRIBERY,  CORRUPTION, TAX FRAUD, AND  EMBEZZLEMENT.
TALES OF LAVISH ORNLIES.
NIGHT OF BONGA-BONGA PARTIES.
OH, YES, BERLUSCONI, A  ONE-MAN CHEMICALLY INDUCED  BONER. LAST YEAR, THE REAL-LIFE LEATHER  FACE WAS CONVICTED OF TAX FRAUD,  BUT WE KNOW HISTORICALLY JUST BECAUSE HE'S CONVICTED OF  SOMETHING, BY NO MEANS, MEANS  THAT HE'S GOING TO JAIL. IN THE PAST, HE'S BEEN CHARGED  WITH BRIBERY, TAX FRAUD, ABUSE  OF OFFICE, AND SEX WITH AN UNDERAGED PROSTITUTE, JUST TO  NAME A FEW, AND HE STILL HAS NOT  GONE TO JAIL SO THE INEXPLICABLE ACQUITTAL SHOULD BE COMING  REQUEST MOMENT NOW.
COUNTRY'S SUPREME COURT  UPHELD THE FORMER PRIME  MINISTER'S FOUR-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE ON THURSDAY.
John: THEY UPHELD IT? ( LAUGHTER )  REALLY? SO AFTER ALL THE OTHER CRAP HE'S  PULLED, THEY'RE LOCKING HIM UP  FOR TAX FRAUD? THAT'S LIKE PUTTING DARMA AWAY  FOR FAILING A KITCHEN HEALTH  INSPECTION. DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT TOO MUCH. IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR LUCK HAS  FINALLY RUN OUT, SILVIO. YOU'LL BE TRAINING IN THE  PINSTRIPES FOR PRISON STREEPS.
HE'S LIKELY GOING TO BE  PERFORMING COMMUNITY SERVICE OR  HAVE TO LIVE UNDER HOUSE ARREST.
HOUSE ARREST, BY THE WAY, IN  THE VAIL, SEASIDE ESTATE, OR THE  PILATSO IN ROME.
John: ANOTHER NOT SO MUCH  HOUSE ARREST AS MANSION ARREST. THEY MUST HAVE FELT HOUSE ARREST  IS JUST AS GOOD AS PRISON WHEN  YOUR PALAZZO IS ACTUALLY THE SIZE OF AN ACTUAL PRISON. SO HE'S NOT GOING TO JAIL. SURELY HIS POLITICAL CAREER IS  AT LOWEST OVER.
A LOWER COURT HAD BANNED HIM  FROM HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE FOR  FIVE YEARS. THAT WAS LOWERED TO THREE.
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR HAD  SUGGESTED THAT THAN REDUCED TO A  THREE-MONTH BAN.
John: A THREE-MONTH BAN. ON POLITICS. THAT'S NOT A SENTENCE. THAT'S A VACATION. YOU KNOW WHO I FEEL SORRY FOR IN  ALL OF THIS EYENT CAN'T BELIEVE  I'M SAYING-- THIS ASIDE FROM THE ACTUAL VICTIMS OF BERLUSCONI'S  CRIME, I ACTUALLY FEEL BAD FOR  ANTHONY WEINER MEAN DIDN'T EVEN HAVE SEX WITH ANYONE WHEN HIS  CAREER IS OVER WITHOUT EVEN A  SINGLE BANGA. ONE LAST SHOT AT THE GLOBAL. WHO ARE WE GOING TO GET? GREAT BRITAIN. YOU HAVE TO WORK BETTER THAN  THAT. YOU HAVE TO WORK BETTER. GREAT BRITAIN. GREAT BRITAIN, LAND THAT I LEFT. SO WHAT IS HAPPENING AT NUMBER  10 DOWNING STREET? THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID  CAMERON, MEANWHILE, CRACKING  DOWN ON INTERNET PORNOGRAPHY.
John: HE'S DOING WHAT? WHERE'S MY PASSPORT? I'M SETTING FIRE TO IT. HOW ON EARTH ARE YOU SUPPOSED  TOIN' JACK IF DESTROY ALL THE  UK'S POPULAR PORNOGRAPHIC SITES,  RIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I'M TALKING ABOUT SITES SUCH AS  DOUBLE-DECKER BANG BUS. ( BLEEP ) PALACE. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT OUR FAKE NAME  WEB SITE THERE IS  ( BLEEP )PALACE.NET AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE DOT-COM AND DOT UK  VERSION HAD BEEN TAKEN BUT THE  DOT NET VERSION BELONGS TO US. IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING,  BEEFEATERS.COM ALSO EXISTS BUT  IT SELLS DOG TREATS. THEES A FACT. THAT'S A FACT. NOW DAVID CAMERON'S PROPOSED BAN  IS DISIEPPED TO COMBAT CHILD  PORNOGRAPHY, WHICH EVERYONE, EVERYONE IS IN FAVOR OF A BAN  FOR THAT. UNFORTUNATELY, THE EFFECT OF THE  LAW WILL BE TO SHUT OFF ALL  PORNOGRAPHY TO BRITISH PEOPLE AND THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING TO  WORK.
THERE ARE SOME SEARCHES WHERE  PEOPLE SHOULD BE GIVEN CLEAR  ROUTES OUT OF THAT SEARCH TO LEGITIMATE SITES ON THE WEB. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. IF SOMEONE IS TYPING IN "CHILD"  AND "SEX" THERE SHOULD COME UP A  LIST OF OPTIONS. "DO YOU MEAN CHILD SEX  EDUCATION? DO YOU MEAN CHILD GENDER?"  SIMILARLY DONKEY PUNCH WILL  PRODUCE WHOLESOME VIDEOS OF DONKEYS BEING PUNCHED IN FACE. ALSO, CLEVELAND STEAMER OF  PRODUCE IMAGES OF A STEAMSHIP ON  THE GLORIOUS OHIO RIVER TAKING A DUMP ON SOMEONE. TO BE FAIR TO THE BRITISH  LEADER, THERE IS A BUILT-IN WE  AROUND THIS BAN.
ALL INTERNET USERS WILL HAVE  TO SAY CL WEATHER THEY WANT TO  HAVE ACCESS TO PORN.
YOU HAVE TO OPT IN, NOT OPT  OUT.
John: SEE? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TELL YOUR  SERVICE PROVIDER YOU WANT PORN,  AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU PORN. IT'S SIMPLE. WHICH LEADS ME TO MY NEW ONE-MAN  SHOW "A BRITISH PERSON ORDERS  PORNOGRAPHY."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CLEARS THROAT )  HELLO? IS THIS THE INTERNET DIVISION? SORRY TO BE A BOTHER. I WAS JUST WONDERING IF I  COULD-- TO-- IF YOU COULD FLIP  THE SWITCH THAT MAKES THE UM-- WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN LOVE EACH  OTHER VERY MUCH, LESS LOVE, MORE  TRANSACTION-- YES, YES. THE SPANKINGS PACKAGE. THAT IS WHAT I WANT. THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR. THANK YOU, A GOOD DAY TO YOU  SIR. I SAID GOOD DAY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
