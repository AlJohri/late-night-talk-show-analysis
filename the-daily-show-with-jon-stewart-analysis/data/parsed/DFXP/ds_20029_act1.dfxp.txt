FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'RE BACK! BOOM! TONIGHT'S GUEST, OLD FRIEND OF THE SHOW. JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO. HE'S GOT HIS BOOK OUT, "SUICIDE PACT." WHICH IS, IT'S REALLY FUNNIER THAN IT SOUNDS. BUT FIRST, WHILE WE WERE ALL HOME LAST WEEK, RIDDING THE NATION OF ITS TURKEY SCOURGE--  (LAUGHTER)  THEY KNOW WHAT THEY DID. THE GRAND JURY VERDICT IN MISSOURI WAS DECIDING THAT FERGUSON POLICE OFFICER NOW FORMER FERGUSON POLICE OFFICER DARREN WILSON DID NOTHING INDICTABLE WHEN HE SHOT UNARMED BUT LARGE MICHAEL BROWN. THE ANGRY REACTION TO THIS DECISION WAS SWIFT AND SUSTAINED. THE PROTESTS BREAKING OUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. BUT IF THOSE WHO TOOK THE STREETS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE SPEAKING OUT AGAINST SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE, THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG.
THIS IS NOT A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE.
IT'S NOT A BLACK WHITE SITUATION.
IT'S A THUG-POLICE OFFICER SITUATION.
PEOPLE FORGET, HE HAD COMMITTED A ROBBERY.
MICHAEL BROWN WAS THE BAD GUY IN THIS CASE. AND PLEASE, AMERICA, LET'S NOT TURN THIS KID INTO SOME KIND OF CIVIL RIGHTS MARTYR BECAUSE THAT HE IS NOT.
FERGUSON, MISSOURI IS NOT SELMA, ALABAMA.
Jon: RIGHT! (LAUGHTER) ALMOST BY DEFINITION. (LAUGHTER) FERGUSON, MISSOURI, IS NOT SELMA, ALABAMA. OF COURSE, IF FOX HAD BEEN AROUND FOR SELMA, ALABAMA, THE HEADLINE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN, RELAX, SELMA ISN'T SLAVERY.  SO THIS ISN'T A CIVIL RIGHTS THING. ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW. THE PROTESTS I SAW SEEMED PRETTY CIVIL RIGHTS-Y. FROM THOSE IN LOS ANGELES TO THE NFL, TO THE STREETS RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK.
[BLEEP] THE ANGER. [BLEEP] THE LEVEL OF [BLEEP] [BLEEP] VOICES [BLEEP] HAS ONLY GOTTEN LOUDER. AND THEY'VE PICKED PEOPLE UP ALONG THE WAY.
[BLEEP] CNN [BLEEP] CNN! AS YOU CAN HEAR [BLEEP] THESE PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PROTEST.
[BLEEP] CNN!
I FEEL YOU. (LAUGHTER) BUT I GET WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THERE. THIS IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. LIKE THE POLICE SHOOTING OF TAMIR RICE IN CLEVELAND OR DANTE PARKER IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY OR KENDREC McDADE IN PASADENA OR ARMAND BENNETT IN NEW ORLEANS OR JOHN CRAWFORD -- WHAT TIME DOES COLBERT START? WHAT TIME DOES HIS SHOW START? IT'S IN LIKE A HALF HOUR, RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, WE'LL JUST-- WE'LL MOVE ON. THE POINT IS-- THESE SHOOTINGS ARE CLEARLY NOT A MANIFESTATION OF SYSTEMIC INEQUALITY AND MISTRUST BETWEEN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THE SOMEHOW ALWAYS JUSTIFIED POLICE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. BUT THESE ARE MERELY AN UNENDING BIZARRELY SIMILAR SERIES OF ISOLATED INCIDENTS. (LAUGHTER) BUT IF THERE IS NOTHING TO JUSTIFY THE ANGER AND PROTESTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES, WHY WOULD SO MANY INDIVIDUALS AROUND THE COUNTRY SPEND THEIR PRECIOUS, HARD-EARNED PRE-CHRISTMAS SALE STAMPEDING TIME PROTESTING A NONEXISTENT PROBLEM.
YOU LOOK AT FERGUSON, THEY HAD A COMMUNITY THAT REALLY WORKED, OR IT SEEMED TO HAVE WORKED. AND NOW ALL THIS HATRED IS COMING OUT. YOU HAVE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE INCITING AND TRYING TO GET THEIR OWN TWO CENTS IN AND THEY'RE TRYING TO INCITE PROBLEMS.
SURE.
PITTING WHITES AGAINST BLACKS.
I THINK THE RACIAL ARSONISTS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE WORKED THESE PEOPLE UP SO MUCH WITH PROPAGANDA, THAT FACTS DON'T MATTER.
OH, THAT'S WHY. THEY TAKE TO THE STREETS. THEY WERE INCITED BY RACIAL ARSONISTS. YOU KNOW, I HAVE A DREAM. THAT ONE DAY WE CAN EVOLVE AS A PEOPLE TO A TIME WHEN ARSONISTS NO LONGER SEE RACE. (LAUGHTER) BUT SEE REALLY ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL CONSUMING FIRE THEY ARE CRIMINALLY COMPELLED TO LIGHT. WHEN AN ARSONIST CAN SAY THE ONLY COLOR I SEE IS ORANGE. BUT I GET IT, THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM IF A RACIAL  ARSONIST-- IF A RACIAL ARSONIST HADN'T-- IF A RACIAL ARSONIST HADN'T LIT THE FIRE UNDER FERGUSON WITH HIS TELLING OF WHAT HAPPENED MATCH. AND BY THE WAY, RACIAL ARSONISTS WERE NOT THE ONLY INCITERS.
THESE RACIAL RACKETEERS.
RACE HUSTLERS
RACE GRIEVANCE INDUSTRY LEADERS.
YOUR RACE GRIFTERS, YOUR RACE COUNTERFEITERS, YOUR RACE LITTERERS, YOUR RACE FINANCIAL ADVISORS, YOUR RACE, YOUR RACE SOMMELIERS. WHAT IS WRONG WITH A NICE WHITE? BUT--  (APPLAUSE) BUT THE POINT IS, THESE PROTESTS MAY LOOK LIKE A SPONTANEOUS GROUNDSWELL OF FRUSTRATION, GRIEF AND ANGER AMONGST THE COMMUNITY THAT FEELS DISENFRANCHISED. BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY JUST THE PRESCRIBED BIDDING OF AMERICA'S RACE GRIEVANCE PUPPETEERS. AND WHO MIGHT THEY BE, YOU ASK? PROFESSOR? THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
THE PRESIDENT AND ERIC HOLDER AND AL SHARPTON, I THINK THEY'VE BEEN TERRIBLY IRRESPONSIBLE.
FERGUSON BURNS BECAUSE OF IN PART A MIND-SET WAS CREATED BY AL SHARPTON, BY ERIC HOLDER AND THE PRESIDENT.
Jon: BE HONEST MY FRIEND, ARE THOSE THE THREE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE OR DID YOU JUST NAME THE ONLY THREE BLACK GUYS YOU COULD THINK OF? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WHAT? WHICH ONE? FERGUSON BURNS, MY FRIEND, IN PART BECAUSE OF JAY-Z THE GUY WHO PLAYS URKEL AND LET'S SAY HANK AARON. I DON'T KNOW. NOW HERE'S WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING. WHAT IS THE MIND-SET THAT HAS BEEN INSTILLED, THAT CREATES THE CONDITIONS FOR THIS UPSET WITHIN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY?
THE HEAD OF THIS NETWORK ROGER AILES HAS BRILLIANTLY SAID THAT IF YOU SEE YOURSELF AS A VICTIM, THEN YOU WILL BECOME A VICTIM, BUT IF YOU SEE YOURSELF AS A WINNER, THEN YOU WILL EVENTUALLY WIN.
KEEP A DREAM JOURNAL, FOLKS. (LAUGHTER) A VICTIM MENTALITY IS WHAT IS CAUSING THIS. A VICTIM MENTALITY. A GENTLEMAN ON FOX. A GENTLEMAN ON FOX NEWS SAID THAT BLACK PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONVINCED BY A NETWORK OF SHREWD PROPAGANDISTS THAT THEY ARE SOMEHOW VICTIMS. AND THAT IS WRONG TO AGITATE A POPULATION, TO SCARE THEM, UTILIZING ALL THE TOOLS OF MODERN COMMUNICATIONS, GRAPHICS, MUSIC, ET CETERA. TO STOKE THESE PEOPLE INTO A RESENTFUL FRENZY. FOX NEWS FEELS THAT'S JUST DAMAGING TO THIS GREAT NATION AND TEARS AT OUR VERY FABRIC. I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE WOULD DO SUCH A THING AT -- JUST ROLL THE [BLEEP] TAPE.
THE PRESIDENT IS SELLING CLASS WARFARE.
IS THERE A GROWING ANTI-WHITE PEOPLE MOVEMENT IN AMERICA?
THE FEDS AND MANY STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE WORKING HARD TO TAKE THAT WAY YOUR GUNS.
MEANWHILE THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY.
THE INVASION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
WE HAVE TERRORISTS CROSSING THE MEXICAN BORDER.
SINGLED OUT FOR ITS CHRISTIAN MESSAGE.
WE CAN PICK ON WHITE GUYS, WE CAN PICK ON CHRISTIANS IN THIS COUNTRY.
FOOD STAMP ABUSERS, FEEDING ON TAXPAYERS.
THE UNITED STATES OF ENTITLEMENT.
THEY'RE STEALING OUR MONEY AND THE TAXPAYERS SHOULD RISE UP.
WE ARE UNDER A TYRANNY NOW.
ALL HAIL KING OBAMA.
AN IMPERIAL PRESIDENT.
AMERICA'S FREEDOM IS SLIPPING AWAY.
AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND HER.
AMERICA YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE.
IT IS TIME THAT WE TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK.
YOU NEED TO GET ANGRY. OUR WORST FEARS MIGHT VERY WELL BE HERE.
HOLY [BLEEP]. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M SUPPOSED TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT OR GET ONE OF THEM PANIC ROOMS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. BUT EITHER WAY, I'M JUST HAPPY TO NOT BE INCITED. IT ALMOST MAKES YOU THINK THAT THE CRIME THAT THEY'RE REALLY UP SET ABOUT OVER THERE ISN'T RACE PIMPING OR RACE ARSON, IT'S RACE PLAGIARISM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
