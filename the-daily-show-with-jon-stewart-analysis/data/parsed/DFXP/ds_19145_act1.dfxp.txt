FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, VERY, VERY FUNNY COMEDIAN TODD GLASS IS GOING TO BE JOINING US, BUT FIRST, THE NEWS HAS BEEN VERY GRIM LATELY. YOU'VE GOT, YOU'VE GOT YOUR ISIS THERE RAMPAGING THROUGH THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU'VE GOT YOUR TERRIBLE SITUATION IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI THERE. ON TOP OF ALL THAT WE FOUND OUT TODAY HELLO KITTY NOT EVEN A CAT. IT'S NOT A CAT. HELLO KITTY IS APPARENTLY JUST A THIRD GRADER WHO LIVES IN LONDON AND [BLEEPED] IN A SANDY BOX OR I DON'T KNOW. [LAUGHTER] MY POINT IS THIS, WE COULD REALLY USE SOME GOOD NEWS RIGHT ABOUT NOW.
TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY PLANS TO BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FRIDAY ON THE WAY TO A POSSIBLE RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016.
Jon: HALLELUJAH. AND THE LORD DID TELL HIM TO RUN AND IT WAS GOOD.
THAT MEANS HE WON'T BE IN AUSTIN, TEXAS, FOR HIS ARRAIGNMENT ON FELONY CHARGES.
Jon: WHAT? NO! YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE THIS TO ME AND THEN JUST TAKE IT AWAY. WHAT KIND OF CRUEL GOD ARE YOU?
IT WASN'T THE TYPICAL BOOKING AT THE TRAVIS COUNTY COURTHOUSE TUESDAY NIGHT, AND IT WASN'T THE TYPICAL MUGSHOT, A SMIRKING SITTING GOVERNOR OF TEXAS.
Jon: I GOT TO TELL YOU, THAT'S AN OLAN MILLS QUALITY MUGSHOT, THAT IS, CHISELED JAW, SUN-KISSED SKIN, THOSE EYES THAT SAY, YEAH, I MIGHT HAVE [BLEEPED] UP A LITTLE BIT. IT'S ALL GOOD. LOOK, THIS... I'M GUESSING THAT OLD RICK PERRY, HE WASN'T ARRAIGNED ON A CHARGE OF BEING CRIMINALLY HANDSOME.
A GRAND JURY IN TEXAS INDICTED PERRY LATE FRIDAY NIGHT ON TWO FELONY COUNTS, ONE COUNT OF ABUSE OF POWER, THE OTHER COUNT OF COERCION OF A PUBLIC SERVANT.
Jon: NOT TO MENTION A MISDEMEANOR FOR STEALING MSNBC'S GLASSES. LOOK, THEY NEED TO SEE, RICK!
THE CHARGES STEM FROM PERRY'S THREAT TO VETO FUNDING FOR THE TRAVIS COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S PUBLIC INTEGRITY UNIT UNLESS D.A. ROSMARY LEHMBERG RESIGNS.
THE PUBLIC INTEGRITY UNIT AT THAT VERY TIME WAS INVESTIGATING CRONYISM AND GOVERNOR PERRY'S CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM.
Jon: WAIT. CRONYISM IN CANCER RESEARCH? HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK? WHAT? ALL THE BENIGN TUMORS GO TO YOUR GOLF BUDDYS? HOW DOES THAT WORK? [LAUGHTER] WHATEVER THE CASE, I CAN'T BELIEVE GOVERNOR PERRY WOULD BULLY THIS INNOCENT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, WHO I IMAGINE IS SOME KIND OF WELL-MEANING DEMOCRATIC INTEGRITY WARRIOR PRINCESS.
LEHMBERG WAS ARRESTED FOR DRIVING DRUNK IN APRIL 2013 AND WAS SEEN ACTING BELLIGERENT AT HER BOOKING IN A NOW-INFAMOUS VIDEO.
YOU'VE BEING ARRESTED FOR A D.U.I.
THAT'S Y'ALL'S PROBLEM, NOT MINE. [LAUGHTER]
SHE'S LIKE THE LOVE CHILD OF HANNIBAL LECTER AND DAVID HASSELHOFF'S CHEESEBURGER VIDEO. LOOK, LADY, FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO A MUGSHOT. THIS IS HOW YOU DO A MUGSHOT. THERE YOU GO. IF THESE CHARGES STICK, PERRY COULD ACTUALLY BE LOOKING AT SOME SERIOUS JAIL TIME. WHAT DOES THE GOVERNOR HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS? HE'S GOT TO BE WORRIED. KEEP IN MIND, HE'S NEVER BEEN THE BEST AT, YOU KNOW, THE TALKIE TALK.
HOW ARE YOU? HOW ARE YOU DOING?
HOW DO I LOOK?
HOW ARE YOU COPING WITH ALL THIS?
DO I LOOK PRETTY GOOD?
YOU LOOK, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE HANGING IN THERE.
OH COME ON. YOU CAN GIVE ME BETTER THAN THAT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I THINK PERRY'S GOING TO MAKE KIND OF A CREEPY INMATE, IF YOU ASK ME. A LITTLE BIT OF THE "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLECCH." [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, THIS WHOLE THING...NO, NO, NO. THIS WHOLE THING IS A POLITICAL HIT JOB. THIS IS POLITICAL HIT JOB BY THE DEMOCRATS TO SABOTAGE PERRY'S PRESIDENTIAL AMBITION. I'M SURE THE DEMOCRATS ARE LOCK STEP UNITED TO DESTROY PERRY.
EVEN SOME DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING, YOU KNOW, THIS INDICTMENT IS A LODE OF HOOEY.
THE LIBERAL EDITORIAL PAGE OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES" CALLS THE INDICTMENT THE PRODUCT OF AN OVERZEALOUS PROSECUTION.
LIBERAL WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST RUTH MARCUS DUBBED IT A SHOCKINGLY SKIMPY INDICTMENT.
YEAH, WELL I BET THE OLD UBER-LIBERAL SIDE-BOOB GAZELLE IS STILL ON BOARD. DON'T YOU THINK THERE? "RICK PERRY'S EPIC MUGSHOT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW ABOUT WINNING THE INTERNET." THAT DOESN'T EVEN, THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE. AND YET I WANT TO CLICK ON IT. I DON'T... WHY WOULD I? NATIONAL OPINION ASIDE, WHAT EXACTLY IS THE DEMOCRATIC PROSECUTOR TRYING TO DO HERE?
THE JUDGE WHO APPOINTED THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR HIMSELF ARE BUSH-APPOINTED REPUBLICANS.
Jon: WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE? WAIT A MINUTE. I GET WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. IT'S THE OLD SWITCHEROO, DEMOCRATS ARE DEFENDING PERRY BECAUSE THEY REALLY WANT HIM TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE WILL LOSE IN AN ALBEIT ENTERTAINING FASHION, AND REPUBLICANS ARE OKAY WITH THIS INDICTMENT BECAUSE THAT MEANS HE'LL LOSE, ALBEIT IN AN ENTERTAINING FASHION. YOU KNOW WHAT, TO HELL WITH THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS AND PUNDITS. IT'S GOING TO BE JOHN Q. SIX PACK THE PLUMBER THAT ULTIMATELY DECIDES PERRY'S FATE.
THIS IS GOING TO HELP HIM POLITICALLY. TALK ABOUT A BASE RALLYING.
IT'S RALLIED A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES.
THIS MAKES ME LIKE RICK PERRY A LITTLE MORE.
THIS WILL HELP HIM BECOME MORE OF A DARLING FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTER.
YOU CAN'T BUY THIS KIND OF PUBLICITY.
THE PUBLICITY THAT IT'S GIVING HIM TO BUILD AND TRY CHANGE HIS BRAND FROM THE OOPS RICK PERRY THAT WE SAW IN 2012.
Jon: OH, THE PRICELESS REBRAND FROM FORGETFUL DOOF TO POSSIBLE FELON. [LAUGHTER] THE SAME TRICK THAT WORKED WHEN AFTER THE B.P. GULF OIL SPILL THEY RENAMED THEMSELVES AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND [BLEEPED] PUNCH INCORPORATED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
