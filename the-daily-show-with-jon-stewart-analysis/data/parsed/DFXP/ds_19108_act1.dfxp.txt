FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD, GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF TECHNICAL OFFICER, ANEESH CHOPRA. I DUBBED HIM YEARS AGO THE INDIAN GEORGE CLOONEY. YOU WILL SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT -- LADIES... (LAUGHTER) BUT, LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH SOME BAD NEWS FOR AMERICANS WHO LIKE TO HUNT AND KILL THEIR OWN BURRITOS.
CHIPOTLE RESTAURANTS ARE ASKING YOU TO LEAVE YOUR GUNS AT HOME.
Jon: WHAT! CHIPOTLE WANTS ME TO LEAVE MY GUNS AT HOME! SPEND TWENTY MINUTES AT A CASUAL FAST FOOD RESTAURANT WITHOUT A HANDGUN? WHY DON'T I JUST LET THE KING OF ENGLAND (BLEEP) IN MY MOUTH?! HOW ABOUT THAT! TYRANNY! JUST CURIOUS, WHY DID CHIPOTLE HAVE TO INSTITUTE A NO-GUNS PLEASE POLICY?
IT FOLLOWS A GUNS RIGHT DEMONSTRATION AT ONE OF THE CHAIN'S DALLAS RESTAURANTS THIS WEEKEND. THE PROTESTERS BROUGHT LOADED ASSAULT STYLE WEAPONS INTO CHIPOLTE, UPSETTING SOME CUSTOMERS.
Jon: DID THAT UPSET SOME CUSTOMERS? NO, I GET THAT. IF I WAS LOOKING TO FEAR FOR MY LIFE IN A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT, I WOULD GO TO ARBY'S. BOOM! TAKE THAT INEXPLICABLE HATRED OF A RESTAURANT THAT'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING BUT PLEASANT TO ME. ALRIGHT, SO WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE? WHAT DO WE GOT THERE? OH YEAH, GUYS WALKED INTO A CHIPOLTLE BRANDISHING ASSAULT RIFLES. NOW WE ALL KNOW THE ONLY WAY TO STOP A BAD GUY WITH A GUN IS A GOOD GUY WITH A GUN. BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM, WITH OPEN CARRYING OF ASSAULT RIFLES, NO ONE IN THAT CHIPOTLE KNOWS YOU'RE A GOOD GUY. THEY JUST KNOW YOU HAVE A GUN. AND HERE'S THE THING, EVEN IF YOU PUT YOUR GUN UP AND GO, DON'T WORRY, EVERYBODY! WE'RE GOOD GUYS! THAT'S THE TYPE OF THING A CLEVER BAD GUY MIGHT SAY. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, CHIPOTLE'S ASSAULT ON ASSAULT RIFLES IS JUST ONE PART OF A LARGER ATTACK ON FIREARMS SUPPORTERS, AS MARYLAND GUN STORE OWNER ANDY RAYMOND LEARNED WHEN HE WAS TARGETED BY EXTREMISTS JUST FOR TRYING TO SELL GUNS.
ONE CALLER WARNED RAYMOND'S BUSINESS WOULD BE BURNED TO THE GROUND AND ANOTHER THREATENED RAYMOND WOULD GET WHAT WAS COMING TO HIM.
SO, ANYWAY, OBVIOUSLY I RECEIVED NUMEROUS DEATH THREATS TODAY. I REALLY [BLEEP] APPRECIATE IT. IT WAS [BLEEP] CLASSY.
Jon: FOR THE RECORD, THE DEATH THREATS HE RECEIVED, THEY WERE REALLY (BLEEP) CLASSY. THEY WERE GLOSS EMBOSSED, 80 POUND PAPER, VERY THICK. LOOK, I SUPPORT REASONABLE GUN SAFETY MEASURES AS MUCH AS THE OTHER 90% OF ALL AMERICANS, BUT THERE'S "NO" EXCUSE FOR ANTI-GUN PEOPLE TO THREATEN ANYONE.
THE HATE MAIL WASN'T FROM ANTI-GUN FOLKS BUT FROM GUN OWNERS ACCUSING ANDY OF BEING A GUN RIGHTS TRAITOR FOR BEING WILLING TO SELL A WEAPON SOME OWNERS SEE AS  THREAT TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
WHAT THE (BLEEP). WHAT KIND OF GUN IS A THREAT TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT? A GUN THAT SHOOTS OTHER GUNS? A GUN THAT GOES BACK IN TIME AND KILLS AMENDMENTS?
A NEW WEAPON CALLED THE SMARTGUN USES COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY THAT PREVENTS ANYONE OTHER THAN THE GUN'S OWNER FROM SHOOTING.
MADE IN GERMANY, IT REQUIRES USERS TO WEAR A RADIO-CONTROLLED WATCH TO FIRE IT.
BELINDA LEADS THE AMERICAN DIVISION OF ARMATEX. SHE MET ME AT A MARYLAND GUN RANGE.
SO, RED MEANS YOU ARE NOT THE AUTHORIZED USER.
PUTTING THE AMMUNITION IN. I CAN FIRE."
WOW, THAT'S LIKE SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD LIVE TO SEE, AN MSNBC HOST AT A SHOOTING RANGE! (LAUGHTER) BUT THIS SMART GUN SOUNDS GOOD, TOO! IT PROTECTS YOUR HOME, IT DOES YOUR KID'S ALGEBRA, AND IT CAN'T BE TURNED AGAINST YOU. WHO WOULDN'T WANT THAT?
NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN SOMEBODY BREAKS IN, BEFORE I CAN SHOOT MY GUN, "WHERE'S MY BRACELET!? I'VE GOT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS!" (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YEAH! (BLEEP) YEAH! NO, THAT DOES SEEM LIKE AN AWFUL LOT OF HASSLE TO GO THROUGH BEFORE GETTING TO SHOOT SOMEONE. IT'S SO ONEROUS. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, REACH WITH MY GUN WITH THIS HAND AND USE MY OTHER HAND TO GET THIS OTHER THING? IT'S A [BLEEP] WRIST BAND, IT'S NOT A VICTORIAN CORSET! HOLD ON! LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT A SMART GUN, DON'T BUY THEM. HOW IS THIS A SECOND AMENDMENT THREAT?
IN 2002, NEW JERSEY PASSED A LAW REQUIRING THAT ONCE A SMART GUN GOES ON THE MARKET ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY, GUN SELLERS IN NEW JERSEY MUST MOVE WITHIN THREE YEARS TO ONLY SELL SMART GUNS, TAKING TRADITIONAL GUNS OFF THE SHELVES.
Jon: WHOA... POINT, GUN NUTS.  UNLESS ONCE THAT NEW JERSEY LAW'S SPONSOR REALIZED HER LAW WAS NOT MAKING "ALL" GUNS SAFER, BUT PREVENTING "ANY" SAFE GUN FROM BEING SOLD, AND SHE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.
NEW JERSEY STATE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER LORETTA WEINBERG IS OFFERING TO REPEAL A GUN LAW SHE SPONSORED 12 YEARS AGO IF THE NRA AGREES TO STOP ITS OPPOSITION TO SMART GUNS.
Jon: YES! IT'S A WIN-WIN! EVERYONE IS HOLDING HANDS AND SINGING "GUN-BAYA!" (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE KUMBAYA BUT WITH SHOOTING. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR -- N.R.A., THIS IS A DEAL WHERE NEW JERSEY WILL REPEAL A GUN CONTROL LAW IF, IN RETURN, YOU CONSENT TO LET PEOPLE SELL "MORE" GUNS! IT'S LIKE YOUR WET DREAM. I MEAN, WE ALL KNOW HOW PRO-CHOICE YOU ARE GUN-WISE.
THE FACT IS WE BELIEVE IN FREE MARKETS AND FREE CHOICE. THAT'S WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS ABOUT.
THERE IS NO GREATER FREEDOM THAN THE RIGHT TO SURVIVE AND PROTECT OUR FAMILIES WITH ALL THE RIFLES, SHOTGUNS AND HANDGUNS WE WANT.
Jon: SO IT'S A DEAL!
THE NRA FOR ITS PART IS NOT SHOWING ANY SIGNS IT WILL BACK OFF ITS TOUGH STANCE AGAINST THE SMART GUNS.
Jon: HOLY (BLEEP)! FINALLY, THE N.R.A.'S FIGHT TO PROTECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT HAS MET ITS MATCH -- THE N.R.A.! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
