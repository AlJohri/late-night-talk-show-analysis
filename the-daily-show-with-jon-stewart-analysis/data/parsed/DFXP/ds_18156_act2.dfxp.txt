Jon: WELCOME BACK. AMERICA IS A VERY GENEROUS NATION. WE'VE LONG GIVEN AID TO STARVING MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD BUT ARE WE FORGETTING THE TRULY NEEDY? JESSICA WILLIAMS FILED THIS REPORT.
FOR 60 YEARS THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN FEEDING THE WORLD'S HUNGRY WITH THE FOOD FOR PEACE PROGRAM AND RECENTLY USAID THE ORGANIZATION IN CHARGE OF FOOD AID SUGGESTED WE CAN FEED FOUR MILLION ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WITH ONE SLIGHT CHANGE SHIP LESS FOOD AND SEND MORE CASH. FOTHIS MAY DEVASTATE THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US --
THE U.S. SHIPPING INDUSTRY IS IN DIRE NEED OF SUPPORT. ITONY MUNOZ, THE EDITOR OF. MARITIME EXECUTIVE THE NUMBER ONE MAGAZINE FORIVE THE NUMBER MARTIME EXECUTIVES  FEARS SHIPPING COMPANIES WILL BE STARVED FOR INCOME.
THE FOOD FOR PEACE PROGRAM TO THE MARITIME INDUSTRY IS CRITICAL. IT'S OUR COUNTRY'S HERITAGE. AND YOU JUST WANT TO SEND IT OVERSEAS WITH MONEY. THEY ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO TRANSPORT THE FOOD. IT'S STILL GOING ON A SHIP. IT'S STILL GOING TO DJABUTI.
YOU LIKE FILLING UP DJABUTI WITH WHAT IT NEEDS.
IT'S A GOOD PLACE. I UNDERSTAND. I ASKED THE ECONOMIST CHRIS BARRETT WHY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD WANT TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY'S CRITICAL HERITAGE.
WHAT IS THIS ISSUE IS THE SMALL SEGMENT OF SHIPPERS WHO PUT AN AMERICAN FLAG ON THEIR VESSEL AS A WAY OF CAPTURING WINDFALL.
AS A WAY TO SAVE AMERICAN JOBS.
THEY ARE OWNED BY FOREIGN CORPORATIONS THAT CREATE SHELL CORPORATIONS IN THE US. THE WINDFALL GAINS ACCRUE TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN THIS DAY AND AGE IT'S CHEAPER AND SAFER TO SEND CASH.
WHY NOT COMPROMISE AND HAVE THE SHIPPERS HAUL MONEY OVERSEAS.
THE SAME REASON YOU DON'T TAKE YOUR PAYCHECK IN TUNA AND BAGS OF RICE.
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I LIVE. THIS IS A WEEK'S WORTH OF MAKING FUN OF WHITE PEOPLE. I WENT TO FORT LAUDERDALE.
AMERICANS ARE SAYING THERE ARE CHILDREN DYING, HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE TO MOVE PAST THAT AND FOCUS ON YOUR INDUSTRY?
THEY NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THE VERY PART -- A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR HERITAGE IS DISAPPEARING. WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THAT BECAUSE OF CASH, BECAUSE NGO'S WANT MORE CASH. I SAY STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW.
GET IT OUT OF HERE!
GET IT OUT OF HERE.
TO SAVE OUR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING CONGLOMERATES WE NEED TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
IF YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP OUT A FRIEND IN NEED HALFWAY THE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, ARE YOU GOING TO FILL A BASKET OF FOOD IN THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE AND THEN WALK DOWN TO FED-EX AND SPEND ABOUT $60 CENTS OUT OF DOLLAR YOU SPEND AND SHIP IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
FED-EX SHIPS FOOD?
THAT'S NOT THE POINT. I'M MAKING A POINT.
CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME.
CAN I GET 300,000 ROAST BEEF SANDWICHES.
300,000?
AND A MILKSHAKE, PLEASE. ♪  ♪ IN THE NATIONAL SHIPPING CONGLOMERATES HAVE ECONOMIC NEED THEY MUST BALANCE AGAINST THE NEEDS OF THE HUNGRY ♪
GOD BLESS YOU SISTER.
VERY NICE.
