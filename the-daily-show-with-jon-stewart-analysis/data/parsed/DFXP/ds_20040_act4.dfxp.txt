Jon: HEY, THAT'S THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. BEFORE WE GO, OBVIOUSLY AS WE ALWAYS DO, WE CHECK IN WITH OUR FRIEND STEPHEN COLBERT AT THE THE "COLBERT REPORT." HEY STEPHEN, I AM EXCITED FOR YOUR SHOW TONIGHT. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
Stephen: I'M ALWAYS EXCITED, JON.
Jon: RIGHT. BUT, I MEAN, TONIGHT'S A VERY SPECIAL SHOW. VERY EXCITING SHOW.
Stephen: I LIKE TO THINK EVERY SHOW IS SPECIAL, JON. IT'S A LITTLE SOMETHING CALLED PROFESSIONALISM.
Jon: WELL, OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT READY TO SHARE ANY FEELINGS YET. I UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: WHAT FEELINGS, JON? I'M AN EMOTIONLESS, IGNEOUS NEWS ROCK.
Jon: ALRIGHT, WELL, I JUST WANTED TO SAY, HAVE A GREAT SHOW. AND ARE YOU READY?
Stephen: I'M MORE THAN READY, JON. IN FACT, JIMMY? GRAB IT.
