IF YOU CAME ACROSS SOME STRANGE MUCUS OR FECES OR SOMETHING OUT THERE, ON THE SUBWAY, THE STREET OR ANYWHERE ELSE, YOU KNOW, DON'T EAT IT, YOU KNOW. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL... (LAUGHTER) GOOD NEWS, NEW YORKERS! (LAUGHTER) SOUP'S BACK ON! AND THE STREETS AND THE SUBWAYS OF NEW YORK CITY ARE ONCE AGAIN A BLOOD AND FECES BUFFET. WELCOME BACK! GOOD TO SEE YOU. MEANWHILE PRESIDENT OBAMA, FINDS HIMSELF IN BEIJING FOR APEC, THE ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION SUMMIT. IT'S AN INCREDIBLY DRY ECONOMIC CONFERENCE DEDICATED TO PROMOTING GLOBAL PROSPERITY THROUGH THE -- WHAT THE, WHO THE -- WAIT. WHO BREAKS OUT JOSEPH AND THE TECHNICOLOR DRUMMER CORPS FOR AN ECONOMIC SUMMIT? WHAT? FIREWORKS! WHAT THE -- FIREWORKS THAT SPELL OUT APEC, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, CHINA DOES THE WHOLE FIREWORKS THING FOR PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING. THE JUST, THEY LOVE A GOOD FIREWORKS. YOU KNOW, THE SAD THING IS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HE'S BEEN PRETTY BUMMED OUT ABOUT HIS POLITICAL FORTUNES HERE AT HOME. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE SPIRIT OF-- WHAT THE (BLEEP) IS HE WEARING?! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE DIDN'T DRESS FOR A SUMMIT, HE DRESSED FOR THE HUNGER GAMES. (LAUGHTER) WHY IS HE DRESSED LIKE THAT? YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, BY TRADITION, THIS IS INTERESTING, THE HOST COUNTRY OF ECONOMIC SUMMITS USUALLY CHOOSES A FANCIFUL OUTFIT FOR ALL THE WORLD LEADERS TO WEAR. IT'S WHY I'M GLAD THEY'RE NOT HOLDING THEM IN FRANCE AGAIN, BECAUSE THAT -- YOU LIKE THAT? PUTIN? (LAUGHTER) (PURRING) PUTIN. SO OTHER THAN COSPLAY, WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA AT APEC?
CLIMATE CHANGE IS ON THE AGENDA, AND A CHINESE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID GOOD AIR QUALITY IS THE "PRIORITY OF PRIORITIES."
Jon: WELL, THEY THINK. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE OFFICIAL SAY THAT THROUGH THE CURTAIN OF SOUND-DAMPENING SMOG THAT PASSES FOR AIR IN BEIJING. I MEAN, HOW ARE THEY EVEN GOING TO MAKE IT BREATHABLE FOR THE SUMMIT?
TO REDUCE POLLUTION BY ABOUT A THIRD, GOVERNMENT OFFICES AND SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND FACTORIES SHUT DOWN.
Jon: YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, IT TAKES ME BACK, I'LL NEVER FORGET, WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN CHINA, WE USED TO SIT AROUND THE RADIO LISTENING IN THE MORNING HOPING WE WOULD GET OUT OF SCHOOL FOR AN AIR DAY. WELL, DID IT WORK?
THE SKIES HAVE BEEN DUBBED APEC BLUE BY RESIDENTS.
Jon: WELL, AT LEAST THE RESIDENTS WHO DIDN'T FLEE IN FEAR AT THE ENORMOUS SKY FIRE BALL. WHAT IS THIS? SAVE US MOTHER SMOG, IT BURNS! HAVE THEY EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT HOW MAD THE PEOPLE OF BEIJING ARE GOING TO GET AFTER THE SUMMIT WHEN THEIR AIR GOES BACK TO ABNORMAL?
AN EDITORIAL IN THE STATE-LINKED "CHINADAILY" SAID BEIJING RESIDENTS "WILL NO DOUBT FEEL UNEASY WHEN THE CITY IS ONCE AGAIN SMOTHERED IN SMOG AFTER THE APEC MEETING BUT THEY WILL GET USED TO IT AS THEY DID BEFORE."
Jon: THAT MAY BE THE WORST CITY SLOGAN EVER! WELCOME TO BEIJING -- YOU WILL GET USED TO IT -- AS YOU DID BEFORE. (LAUGHTER) BUT, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, THE REAL ACTION WAS INSIDE THE SUMMIT, ALL EYES WERE ON THE LEADERS OF TWO OF THE WORLD'S SUPERPOWERS.
PRESIDENT PUTIN WENT UP TO PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THIS VERY ORNATE ROOM . AND PRESIDENT OBAMA SORT OF AVERTED HIS GAZE AND AVOIDED EYE CONTACT AS IF, NOT AGAIN, I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
Jon: DON'T MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THEY'RE MEAN GIRLS! (LAUGHTER) AND OBAMA IS SHADING PUTIN BECAUSE PUTIN MADE OUT WITH BRANDON WHEN HE KNEW OBAMA LIKED BRANDON. I MEAN, A LITTLE STINK EYE FOR THE GUY WHO IS ARMING ASSAD AND INVADING THE UKRAINE IS NOT NECESSARILY INAPPROPRIATE, ALTHOUGH THE BRANDON THING STINGS, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE, IT STINGS. BY THE WAY, IF YOU THINK THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OBAMA AND PUTIN IS FROSTY, CHECK OUT JAPAN AND CHINA TRYING TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
AN AWKWARD HANDSHAKE BETWEEN CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING AND JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE. IT'S THEIR FIRST FACE-TO-FACE TALKS SINCE EITHER LEADER TOOK OFFICE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. I WOULD RATHER BE HOLDING MY OWN SEVERED PENIS THAN YOUR HAND RIGHT NOW. WELL, REST ASSURED, I AM THINKING OF A SEVERED PENIS JUST TO GET THROUGH HOLDING YOUR HAND. ANYWAY, I HOPE WE CAN WORK THINGS OUT. (LAUGHTER) STILL, YOU HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO PUTIN, THOUGH. OBAMA DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, BUT HE'S STILL OUT THERE TRYING TO MAKE FRIENDS.
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN RAISING SOME EYEBROWS OF HIS OWN. FOR THE RECENTLY DIVORCED VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS GETTING A LITTLE TOO FRIENDLY WITH THE CHINESE FIRST LADY. HE GALLANTLY WRAPPED A COAT AROUND HER SHOULDERS AT AN APEC EVENT. A LITTLE BIT TOO GALLANT, I GUESS. SHE SMILED POLITELY AND THEN MOMENTS LATER SLIPPED THE COAT OFF.
Jon: OH MY GOD, SHE THOUGHT PUTIN JUST ANNEXED THE CHINESE PRESIDENT'S WIFE! THE GUY'S AN ANNEXING MACHINE! OF COURSE, OUR PRESIDENT DID NOT ESCAPE THE WRATH OF CHINA.
PRESIDENT OBAMA ARRIVING AT A DINNER AT THE APEC SUMMIT IN BEIJING CHEWING SOME GUM!
WELL CHINESE BLOGGERS, AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, WENT BALLISTIC.
Jon: YEAH, CHINESE BLOGGERS WHEN BALLISTIC. WAIT A MINUTE, YOUR BLOGGERS GINNED UP OUTRAGE OVER SOMETHING TRIVIAL? MAYBE OUR COUNTRIES AREN'T SO DIFFERENT AFTER ALL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
