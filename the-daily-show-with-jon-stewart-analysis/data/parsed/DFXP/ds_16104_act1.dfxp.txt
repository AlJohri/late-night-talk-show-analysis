AUGUST 9, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US! WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW THAT WE HAVE PREPARED IT FOR YOU WITH... LOVE. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, JAY BAHADUR, AUTHOR OF "THE PIRATES OF SOMALIA." BY THE WAY, "PIRATES OF  SOMALIA," WORST DISNEY LAND RIDE EVER. (LAUGHTER) IT'S A SMALL WORLD, PIRATES OF... (LAUGHTER). BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, RECENT WEEKS HAVE SEEN SUCH DISCORD AND STRIFE HERE IN OUR UNITED STATES. OUR STAGNATING ECONOMY AND... WHAT'S A WORSE WORD THAN "STAGNATING" FOR A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM? (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) IT'S COST US OUR A.A.A. CREDIT RATING. BUT BEFORE WE GET TOO DOWN, REMEMBER THAT IN SOME STILL CREDIT-WORTHY COUNTRIES THE THIRD "A" NOW APPARENTLY STANDS  FOR "ARSON." LONDON IS ON FIRE! DEAR GOD! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON OVER IN BRITAIN? PLEASE TELL ME THE CLASH REUNITED AND THEY'RE SHOOTING A NEW ALBUM COVER? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PLEASE? WAIT, I'M... HOLD ON. I'M BEING TOLD THAT IT'S NOT THE CASE.
NEW VIOLENCE AND NEW FIRES ARE BREAKING OUT AFTER A WEEKEND OF MAYHEM.
FOR A THIRD TERRIBLE NIGHT LONDON BURNS.
RIOTS IN BRITAIN SPREADING BEYOND LONDON TO THREE OTHER CITIES.
IT'S BEING CALLED THE BATTLE FOR LONDON.
IT'S BEING CALLED MINDLESS VIOLENCE.
Jon: IT'S BEEN CALLED THE HOODIE BLITZ. (LAUGHTER) THE REGRETTABLE HULLABALOO. (LAUGHTER) BEEF YELLINGTON. (LAUGHTER) AND, SHOCKINGLY, A RIGHT SODDING FUSTER IN THE GOOLIES. (LAUGHTER) THE RIOTS... (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) YOU LIKE THAT? BULLOCKS! THE RIOTS WERE SPARKED BY A SUSPICIOUS POLICE SHOOTING OF A YOUNG MAN BUT AS THEY SPREAD  THROUGH LONDON AND BEYOND BECAME MORE ROOTED IN PROLETARIAN RAGE. OR THE DESIRE TO GET THINGS STORES NORMALLY MAKE YOU PAY FOR. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE ABOUT AN AN FENWAY PARKKY IN THE  U.K.: EVEN THEIR LOOTERS QUEUE UP. (IN AN ENGLISH ACCENT) "DO YOU MIND IF I GET THAT TELLLY? AFTER YOU." HOW BAD HAS THE SITUATION GOTTEN?
PRIME MINISTER CAM REASON CAME BACK FROM VACATION TO ATTEND TO THIS. SOME SAY ESHED HAVE DONE THAT A COUPLE DAYS AGO.
WHY DID IT TAKE THREE NIGHTS OF CONSECUTIVE RIOTS AND LOOTING?
Jon: THREE NIGHTS OF CONSECUTIVE RIOTING AND LOOTING WHEN THE ONLY THOUGHT THAT THE  CITY WOULD BURN FOR ONE NIGHT... (LAUGHTER). IT'S A MIRACLE. PERHAPS CAMERON HAS RETURNED TO CELEBRATE HOOLIGANIKACHUH, THE FESTIVAL OF FIGHTS. (LAUGHTER) I APOLOGIZE, JEWS WILL GO OUT OF OUR WAY TO CREATE A NEW HOLIDAY. WE VERY MUCH LIKE STAYING HOME FROM WORK. SO TOUGH TIMES IN BRITAIN FOR, WELL, NEARLY ALL BUSINESSES. NOT ALL, SOME BUSINESSES. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, SEEING AN EMERGENCY GLASS REPAIR VAN DRIVING THROUGH  A RIOT-TORN NEIGHBORHOOD RIFE WITH FLYING ROCKS, NOT THE SAME WITHOUT MUSICAL ACCOMPANIMENT. (PLAYING THE THEME FROM "BENNY HILL") (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  BUT WHILE EMERGENCY PLATE GLASS SALES MAY BE BOOMING, THE REST OF ENGLAND AND, IN FACT, ALL OF  EUROPE'S ECONOMY IS STILL IN DEEP TROUBLE.
FEARS OF LOOMING ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE IN EUROPE.
A CRISIS OVER DEBT IS ACCELERATING THROUGHOUT THE EUROZONE.
INVESTORS ARE SCRAMBLING STOKED LARGELY BY FEARS THAT ITALY AND SPAIN ARE TEETERING ON  THE BRINK OF GOING BROKE.
Jon: WHAT? WAIT! WHAT? (LAUGHTER) WHO ARE YOU? THE DOUBLE PHONE? THAT'S NOT... WHO'S THAT... YOU KNOW, THAT'S CLEARLY... TO BE  FAIR, NOT SOMETHING ANYBODY DOES ON PURPOSE, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GREAT? IF THE GUY IN THE DOUBLE PHONE IS TALKING TO TWO PEOPLE AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH STOCK. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S RIGHT, THE KEY TO TURKEY IS BRINING. THAT'S RIGHT. NO, YOU HANG UP. (LAUGHTER) NO, YOU HANG UP. OF COURSE, THERE IS A WAY OUT. BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE IT.
THE ONE TO WATCH HERE IS REALLY THE GERMAN INDEX.
ALL THE EYES ARE ON GERMANY. WHO'S GOING TO SAVE THE EURO.
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING THERE ARE WORRIES ABOUT TRANSFERS OF WEALTH FROM GERMANY TO THE OTHER  EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
IT'S ALL ON GERMANY'S SHOULDERS.
Jon: WE NEED GERMANY TO SAVE EUROPE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'RE (BLEEP)ED! WE'RE TOTALLY (BLEEP)ED! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE CAN'T! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOLD ON. HOLD ON ONE SECOND. NO, YOU HANG UP. (LAUGHTER) PLEASE, STOP IT. WITH MORE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN EUROPE, WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR EUROPEAN  CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER. JOHN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EVER SINCE THE CREATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THERE HAVE BEEN  NEARLY TWO DECADES OF UNPRECEDENTED PEACE, PROSPERITY AND COOPERATION. SUDDENLY CHAOS. WHAT'S GOING ON?
WELL, JUST THAT, JON, WE'VE BEEN PEACEFULLY CORPORATING. EUROPE AT ITS BEST IS A CONTINENT OF ETHNICALLY AND CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETIES  LIVING IN A STATE OF CONSTANT WAR WITH EACH OTHER.
Jon: WAIT, AT ITS BEST?
ABSOLUTELY, JON. VIOLENT HATRED OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS GIVES YOU A PERMANENT SENSE OF PURPOSE. SOMETHING TO CLING TO IN TIMES OF TROUBLE. EUROPE IS NEVER MORE STABLE THAN WHEN IT'S ATTACKING ITSELF. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I APPRECIATE THE HISTORY OF EUROPE, BUT WARS DON'T PROVIDE STABILITY.
WHAT? OF COURSE THEY DO! (LAUGHTER) JON, WE HAD A HUNDRED-YEAR WAR! YOU DON'T GET MUCH MORE STABLE THAN THAT. (LAUGHTER) IT'S EASY. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO, EVERY MORNING...
Jon: I DON'T THINK THAT'S...
EVERY MORNING YOU GET UP AND THINK "WHAT WILL I DO TODAY? I KNOW, I'LL FIGHT THE FRENCH LIKE I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE PREVIOUS 99 YEARS!" (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WARS AREN'T... WARS ARE TERRIBLE.
YES. (LAUGHTER) BUT EUROPEAN WARS DO SOME GREAT THINGS. THEY STIMULATE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, FOSTER FEELINGS OF NATIONAL PRIDE, REALLY HELP  EVERYONE BLOW OFF SOME STEAM AND THE MOVIES ABOUT THEM ARE TERRIFIC! (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN." COME ON, JON, THAT'S A BEST  PICTURE WINNER RIGHT THERE.
Jon: ACTUALLY, "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN" DIDN'T WIN. IT LOST THE "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE."
ARE YOU (BLEEP)ING KIDDING ME? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: THAT'S TRUE.
ARE YOU (BLEEP)ING KIDDING ME?
Jon: NO.
THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN NOMINATED, JON! WE'RE TALKING ABOUT "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN!" WHAT A CAST. SO MANY FUTURE STARS, THE SCORE WAS SENSATIONAL AND THE DIRECTION-- AND I KNOW YOU GET  TIRED OF SAYING THIS ABOUT SPIELBERG-- WAS IMPECCABLE. "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE" WAS A PIECE OF (BLEEP), JON! THAT'S ANOTHER WHIFF FROM THE ACADEMY.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT. POINT'S WELL TAKEN. GETTING BACK TO EUROPE.
IT'S LIKE WHEN "DANCES WITH WOLVES BEAT GOODFELLAS" ALL OVER AGAIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THAT WAS A (BLEEP)ING DISGRACE. (LAUGHTER) SCORSESE IS AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME, SO MANY UNBELIEVABLE CATCH  PHRASES THAT COME OUT OF THAT THING. "DANCING WITH WOLVES", "TONKA." A TRAVESTY BEYOND WHAT PEOPLE CONSIDER... I'M NOT ARGUING.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
I'M NOT ARGUING WITH YOU, JON, BUT IF WE CAN GET BACK TO EUROPE...
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
RIGHT NOW IT IS VITAL THAT SOMEONE AT THE VERY LEAST SHOOT  AN ARCH DUKE AND LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: TO REALLY GET THE BALL ROLLING, I THINK, WOULDN'T EUROPE NEED, THOUGH, A KIND OF  DESPOT TO RISE UP AND, IN YOUR MIND, ANYONE ON THE HORIZON?
NO ONE REALLY WORTH PACKING UP YOUR FAMILY AND CROSSING INTO SWITZERLAND TO ESCAPE FROM. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: JOHN, EVERYTHING WE'VE SEEN SEEMS SO SENSELESS. LOOK AT THE FOOTAGE, THERE'S NO HOPE, NO RHYME OR REASON, THERE'S...
Jon:THERE'S. ..
WHAT? REALLY? YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT IT THE RIGHT WAY, JON. TURN THE FOOTAGE BLACK AND WHITE AND GIVE ME SOME JAUNTY MUSIC. WATCH THIS, JON. SUMMERTIME IN EUROPE AND EVERYONE'S FEELING THE HEAT. THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR RAILS AGAINST THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF THE GREEKS. NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL A SOUR KRAUT. MEANWHILE, HOLLYWOOD'S BRIGHTEST STARS COME OUT TO SHINE WITH THE  PREMIER OF "THE CHANGEUP." IT'S ANOTHER CLASSIC SWITCHEROO. AND THAT'S TODAY'S WORLD NEWS OF THE WORLD TODAY. PIP PIP! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WOW, I'VE GOT TO ADMIT, THAT FILLED MY HEART A LITTLE BIT. REALLY DOES TAKE ME BACK TO THAT TIME WHEN AMERICA HAD SUCH PURPOSE AS WELL. YOU KNOW, THE GREAT ESTROGEN NATION MANY WAYS...
OH, SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN. EASY NOW.
Jon: JUST SAYING, IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A WAR, MAYBE AMERICA COULD...
COOL IT, COOL IT.
Jon: JUMP IN REALLY GOOD...
COOL IT.
Jon: I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOOD AT THESE TYPES OF WARS.
NOT SO FAST, JON. FIRST LET US DO WHAT WE DO: TEAR OUR ENTIRE CONTINENT APART. THEN YOU DO WHAT YOU DO: SIT BACK AND WATCH US, SELL US WEAPONS, BUILD UP YOUR  STRUGGLING ECONOMY AND THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE.
Jon: SWOOP IN AND SAVE THE WORLD FROM EVIL!
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, CAPTAIN AMERICA!
Jon: GOOD TIMES, BABY!
