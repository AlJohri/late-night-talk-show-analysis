(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. I'M IN A GREAT MOOD. THE LEAVES ARE CHANGING COLORS. I'M EXCITED THIS TIME OF YEAR IS MY FAVORITE TIME. I GOT ALL THE PIECES FROM MY STEAMPUNK SPONGEBOB COSTUME. HELLO. BUT THESE'S DAY THOSE ONE IS THINKING ABOUT HALLOWEEN. THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY. THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN EUROPE THREATENING TO BRING DOWN THE GLOBAL BANKING SYSTEM.
THE DEAL HAS FINALLY BEEN REACHED TO TACKLE THE EU'S FINANCIAL CRISIS.
THE HARD WON EUROPEAN AGREEMENT TRANSLATED INTO A HUGE DAY FOR U.S. STOCKS.
THE DOW UP 300-- 340 POINTS WOULD HUAI IT'S OVER, CHAMPAGNE AND CALFIER FOR EVERYBODY. WHOOO, WHOOO, WHOOO. PEOPLE PAY BIG MONEY TO HAVE THE FISH [BLEEP] ON THEIR TONGUE? (LAUGHTER) -- OWES ME AN APOLOGY. SO A GREAT DAY ON WALL STREET ON NEWS OF EUROPE, WE'RE UP LIKE 340 POINTS. SO MUCH BETTER THAN 48 HOURS AGO. ALSO ON NEWS ON EUROPE.
STOCKS FELL 207 POINTS OVER FEARS THE EUROPEAN DEBT AND BANK CRISIS SOLUTION IS  NOWHERE IN SIGHT.
Jon: YEAH THAT WAS A BAD DAY. I REMEMBER THAT DAY WAS ALL OVER FOR ME. I WAS OUT BLOWING DOGS ON THE STREET FOR SPARE CHANGE. (LAUGHTER) ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT DOG CURRENCY IS NOT LEGAL TENDER. (LAUGHTER) THE FISH [BLEEP] SALT S THAT WHAT THEY DO? (LAUGHTER) SO THAT WAS THE OPPOSITE OF WALL STREET'S FRIDAY, WHICH WAS ALSO BASED ON NEWS OF EUROPE.
THE MARKET RIGHT NOW JUMPING TODAY ON NEWS FRANCE AND GERMANY HAVE AGREED TO  BOOST ITS BAILOUT FUND. THE DOW ENDED UP 180 POINTS.
Jon: WHOO-HOO. WE PARTIED SO HARD THAT NIGHT. I WAS DOING COKE WITH A 20-YEAR-OLD MODEL. SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS TUESDAY'S NEWS FROM EUROPE.
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF WORRY ABOUT WHETHER SLOVAKIA.
WILL AGREE TO PONY UP ITS SHARE OF THE EUROPEAN BAILOUT MONEY.
DOWN 47 POINTS.
Jon: I STILL PARTIED HARD THAT NIGHT TOO, JUST CRACK WITH A 62-YEAR-OLD FORMER MODEL. (LAUGHTER) FORTUNATELY HE ACCEPTED DOG MONEY. (LAUGHTER) BUT EVEN THAT WAS A MUCH BETTER NIGHT THAN WALL STREET HAD LAST MONDAY, YOU  KNOW, WHEN THEY GOT THAT NEWS FROM EUROPE.
THE DOW DROPPED NEARLY 250 POINTS AFTER THE GERMAN GOVERNOR PLAYED DOWN HOPES  THAT A SOLUTION TO EUROPE'S DEBT CRISIS WAS IMMINENT.
Jon: THE END TIMES ARE UPON US! I HEARBY EXERCISE THE CLAUSE IN MY COMEDY CENTRAL CONTRACT THAT ALLOWS ME TO EAT ONE CORRESPONDENT. BRING ME MY FINAL MEAL. BRIDGE IT TO ME!
NO, NO, NO, NO,. NO, NO, NO. NO, DON'T.
Jon: LET ME DO IT.
JON, NO, NO, DON'T DO IT THERE'S NO NEED FOR THIS. NO, GET DOWN. BACK OFF, THERE'S NO NEED FOR TO YOU DO THIS. REMEMBER, THEY REACHED A BAILOUT DEAL LAST NIGHT.
Jon: SO WHY IS THE MARKET BEEN SO VOLATILE? EVERYONE KNEW THIS BAILOUT MEETING WAS TAKING PLACE TODAY. THEY KNEW THAT IS WHEN THEY WOULD GET A FINAL ANSWER. WHY DOES WALL STREET REACT SO STRONGLY TO ALL THE RUMORS FROM EUROPE AND EVENTS FROM EUROPE.
IT IS OKAY, IT IS OKAY. I CAN EXPLAIN ALL OF THAT. THE MARKET IS RANDOM AND UNPREDICTABLE. ANYONE THAT CAN TELL YOU THEY CAN PREDICT WHERE THE MARKET IS GOING IN THE NEXT  10 DAYS OR 20 DAYS OR EVEN A MONTH, THEY'RE LYING.
AS YOU CAN SEE, JON, THESE ROYAL SWINGS ARE COMPLETELY NORMAL. THEY IS NOT ONLY-- [BLEEP].
Jon: WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING!
Jon: I'M SORRY. (LAUGHTER) I'M SORRY, I JUST-- THERE MUST BE SOME BENEFIT TO THE VOLATILITY ON WALL STREET, YOU KNOW, FOR THEM.
THERE IS THIS.
ONE ARE THEY SAYING.
OH, THEY LOVE THE VOLATILITY. DON'T GET THAT WRONG. OBVIOUSLY FOR THE AVERAGE INVESTOR AS HOME, WE SWEAT ALL THOSE BIG SWINGS BUT THE  TRADERS THEY COME EVERY DAY TRYING TO MAKE MONEY AND THEY MAKE MACHINE THE MORE  VOLATILITY THERE IS.
Jon: OH SO, UP OR DOWN WIN OR LOSE, THEY STILL WIN. THOSE PEOPLE ARE ANIMALS!
YOU ARE-- OVERREACTING TO THIS SITUATION.
Jon: HMMMM. (LAUGHTER)
I TOLD YOU-- .
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WE'LL SEE YOU IN A
