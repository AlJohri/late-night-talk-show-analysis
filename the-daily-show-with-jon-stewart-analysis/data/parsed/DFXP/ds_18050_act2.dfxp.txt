[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OBVIOUSLY, AMERICA IS GOING  THROUGH A TOUGH TIME. WE'RE A NATION IN DECLINE. THE AMERICAN CENTURY IS OVER. OH, WE HAD TOILET PAPER STUCK TO  OUR SHOES SINCE 2005 AND NOBODY  BOTHERED TO TELL US. IT COULD EVEN LEAVE SOME OF OUR  YOUNG PEOPLE FEELING HOPELESS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] END UP DRESSING IN BLACK AND  WRITING IN A NOTEBOOK ALL THE  TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT RHYMES WITH HENRI? THIS COUNTRY ISN'T HOPELESS  ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO CHINA. WHILE WE'RE SUCK FUNYON DUST AND  GOING BROKE IT SEEMS LIKE CHINA  HAS IT ALL, A GROWING ECONOMY AND SO MANY PANDAS THEY HAVE  BEEN FORCED TO A TWO PANDA  POLICY. FROM NOW ON IN CHINA, THIS IS  TRUE, ONLY TWO PANDAS PER  FAMILY. THE PLACE IS JUST RIPE WITH  (bleep) PANDAS. GUESS WHAT? THE GRASS ISN'T ALWAYS GREENER.
IN CHINA, HAZARDOUS RECORD  HIGH POLLUTION LEVELS IN BEIJING  HAVE PROMPTED AN ORANGE FOG  WARNING.
Jon: THIS BRINGS US TO THE  NEW SEGMENT THINGS MAY BE BAD  BUT AT LEAST WE CAN'T CHEW OUR  AIR. UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOT COMING DOWN,  THE ECONOMY IS STAGNANT. LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.
JUST BEING OUTSIDE CAN MAKE  EYES ITCH AND THROATS BURN.
ONE EXPERT TOLD ME IT'S  BECOMING AN INSTANT MOTOR  VEHICLER.
Jon: S OH, MY GOD, A  BILLION INSTANT SMOKERS. HOW MANY MARLBORO MILES COULD  THEY GET? THINK OF CHINA AS A WHEEZING  SMOKER.
ARE YOU EXPECTED TO TALK.
Jon: SO, MR. BOND, I EXPECT  YOU TO -- BRB CLEARING THROAT] I [CLEARING THROAT] [ LAUGHTER ] WHERE WERE WE, MR. BOND? SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ] WERE SO GRIDLOCKED THE SENATE  CAN'T REFORM THE FILIBUSTER. STOP.
WASH WE WIPE A THIN LAYER  THAT ACCUMULATED ON MOST CARS. THAT IS SOOT AND GRIME. THIS IS MY OWN AIR PURIFIER,  WATCH. THIS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE BREATHING  IN BEIJING.
Jon: DON'T WIPE THAT AWAY. THE CHINESE CHARACTER FOR WASH  ME IS THE SAME AS THE CHARACTER  FOR EM IF A -- EMPHYSEMA. CHINA HAS BAD AIR, BUT OUR  SCHOOL LUNCHES SHOULD BE  HEALTHIER. NO IMAGERY WHINING AUDIENCE  MEMBER YOU DON'T GET IT.
A FACTORY FIRE WENT UNNOTICED  FOR THREE HOURS BECAUSE IT MIXED  RIGHT IN WITH THE SMOG.
Jon: THREE-HOUR FIRE, NO  ONE KNEW. THE ONLY REASON THEY NOTICED,  SOMEONE WONDERING WHY BILLOWING  CLOUDS OF FRESH AIR WERE RISING. DOES EVERYONE UNDERSTAND HOW  MUCH WORST SITUATION IS IN CHINA  THAN AMERICA? DOES EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND THAT?
EXCUSE ME, JON?
Jon: WHAT IS THAT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WEIRD. IT'S RENOWNED ASTRO FIZZISTS  PHYSICIST -- I FORGOT YOU WERE  STAYING IN THE STUDIO WHILE THEY SPRAY YOUR APARTMENT FOR BED  BUGS. TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND --  I OVERHEARD YOU SNEAK SPEAKING,  I'M TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THE MAGNITUDE OF CHINESE  POLLUTION PROBLEM. COULD YOU HELP ME OUT.
Jon: EXPLAIN IT IN TERMS  YOU UNDERSTAND.
YES.
Jon: TRY THIS.
THE RECORD AIR POLLUTION IN  CHINA HAS GOTTEN SO BAD THE  THICK SMOG COULD BE SEEN NOW FROM SPACE.
SPACE?
Jon: YES! [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT EXPLAINS THE NOXIOUS  CLOUD THAT HAS BEEN DISRUPTING  MY LASER TARGETING SYSTEM OF MY SPACE LASER.
Jon: YOU HAVE A SPACE  LASER?
NO, NO. BING. THAT'S MY HOT POCKETS. GOTTA GO EAT THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I THINK HE HAS A SPACE  LASER BUT NO NAIR. SEE THOSE LEGS. [ LAUGHTER ] REMEMBER, AMERICA, THINGS MAY BE  BAD BUT AT LEAST WE CAN'T CHEW  OUR AIR. TUNE IN NEXT WEEK FOR THINGS MAY  BE BAD, BUT AT LEAST WE'RE NOT  RULED BY A CRAZY
