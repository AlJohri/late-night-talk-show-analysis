WELCOME BACK. NOT ONLY WAS TODAY BARACK  OBAMA'S INAUGURATION, IT WAS  ALSO MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY. FOR HIS THOUGHTS ON THIS  HISTORIC OCCASION WE'RE JOINED  BY SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT MORGAN FREEMAN.
THANKS, JIM. THAT'S OKAY. SORRY.
Jon: I GOT IT. WAIT. THE PRESIDENT WAS INRAWING ATED  TODAY
Jon: YES, THAT'S RIGHT  I GUESS I WAS SO BUSY BEING  ANGRY ABOUT HAVING TO WORK ON MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY, I DIDN'T  REALIZE I WAS ALSO MISSING THE  SECOND INAUGURATION OF THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT WHICH NOW MAKES  ME EVEN MORE ANGRY. THANKS, JON.
Jon: SORRY. IT'S OKAY, JON. LOOK, AS LONG AS WE'RE  CELEBRATING DR. KING'S BIRTHDAY,  I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE  REQUEST. CAN WE AS A NATION PLEASE,  PLEASE STOP USING MARTIN LUTHER  KING AS A PROP IN OUR OWN PETTY POLITICAL ARGUMENTS
Jon: YOU MEAN ABOUT RACE? NO, JON. ABOUT EVERYTHING. LISTEN TO WHAT THE CHAIRMAN OF  NATIONAL GUN APPRECIATION DAY  SAID LAST WEEK
I BELIEVE GUN APPRECIATION  DAY HONORS THE LEGACY OF  DR. KING. I THINK HE WOULD AGREE WITH ME  IF HE WERE ALIVE TODAY.
LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE. HE IS NOT ALIVE TODAY. NOW WHAT WAS IT THAT KILLED HIM? I DON'T KNOW, JON. WAS IT DIABETES?
Jon: I DON'T THINK SO  SANDWICH CHOKE MAYBE? MAULED BY LIONS ON THE PORCH OF  A MEMPHIS HOTEL? I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: I DON'T THINK THAT WAS  IT
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT  DR. KING.
HE WOULD AGREE WITH ME IF HE  WERE ALIVE TODAY. THAT IF AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAD  BEEN GIVEN THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS FROM DAY ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S FOUNDING, PERHAPS  SLAVERY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A  CHAPTER IN OUR HISTORY.
SLAVERY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A  CHAPTER. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OPPRESSIVE. FOLLOWED BY THE CHAPTER ENTITLED  ALL THE BLACK PEOPLE ARE DEAD. NOW WHO IS GOING TO BUILD THE  COUNTRY?
Jon: YOU BELIEVE MARTIN  LUTHER KING WOULD HAVE FAVORED  GUN CONTROL
ABSOLUTELY YES  Jon: WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? ON SECOND THOUGHT, NO, HE  WOULDN'T SNOP OKAY. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
WAIT, WAIT. YEAH, HE WOULD. I'M JUST [BLEEP] WITH YOU, JON. I HAVE NO IDEA. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW? DR. KING IS DEAD. OKAY. YOU DON'T GET TO USE HIM AS YOUR  IMAGINARY BLACK YES MAN.
Jon: I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE  MARTIN LUTHER KING IS HELD UP AS  A SYMBOL OF AN UNASALABLE GOOD SO PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE HIM...
JON, I UNDERSTAND. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN USE  HIM TO ENDORSE EVERYTHING YOU  HAPPEN TO LIKE. YOU DON'T LIKE PORN? YOU KNOW WHO LOVES. PORN? MARTIN LUTHER KING
Jon: I REMEMBER HIS LETTERS  TO PENT HOUSE FROM THE  BIRMINGHAM JAIL. ARE PEOPLE BEING REALLY THAT  SPECIFIC WITH KING'S LIKES AND  DISLIKES?
YES, JON. THIS ARIZONA CONGRESSMAN THINKS  HE KNOWS WHAT M.L.K. HATED
EVERY DAY, MR. SPEAKER,  ALMOST 1500 UNBORN BLACK  CHILDREN ARE ABORTED. MR. SPEAKER, I HAVE EVERY  CONVICTION THAT IF HE WERE ALIVE  TODAY, THE REV. MARTIN LUTHER KING WOULD NOT BE SILENT IN THE  FACE OF SUCH AN OUTRAGE.
I THINK IT'S AN OUTRAGE THAT  YOUR STATE SPENT TEN YEARS  FIGHTING TO NOT OBSERVE DR. KING'S BIRTHDAY. OH, AND [BLEEP] YOU, ARIZONA.
Jon: IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, I  BELIEVE [BLEEP] YOU ARIZONA IS  THE STATE MOTTO OF NEVADA.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. VERY INTERESTING, JON. VERY INFORMATIVE, THANK YOU,  JON. LOOK, JON, IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE  THE PUNDITS, MARTIN LUTHER KING  WOULD BE IN ONLY PRO-LIFE PRO GUN TO OCCUPY WALL STREET  RALLIES. REMEMBER OCCUPY WALL STREET?
Jon: SORT OF. IF MARTIN LUTHER KING WERE  ALIVE TODAY HE WOULD BE HERE  STANDING WITH THESE FOLKS
IF ONLY THOSE OCCUPY FOLKS  COULD HAVE HAD A LIVING,  BREATHING CIVIL LENL END THERE WITH THEM. OH, WAIT. THEY DID. JOHN LEWIS M.L.A.K.'S STILL  ALIVE FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE WAS  RIGHT THERE. HMMM. HOW DID THAT GO?
CONGRESSMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS  ICON JOHN LEWIS SHOWED UP BUT  THEY REFUSED TO LET HIM SPEAK.
IN WHICH NO SINGULAR HUMAN  BEING
IN WHICH NO SINGULAR HUMAN  BEING IS INHERENTLY MORE  VALUABLE THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN  BEING.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY  I'M SHOCKED, JON. THEY MISSED A GREAT CHANCE TO  ASK HIM WHAT MARTIN LUTHER KING  WOULD THINK OF THEIR MOVEMENT. WE CAN MAKE KING ENDORSE  WHATEVER WE WANT. HAVE YOU SEEN THE COMMERCIAL ARE  HOLOGRAM M.L.K. HAS A DREAM  ABOUT TELECOMMUNICATIONS BEFORE
BEFORE YOU CAN INSPIRE... WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE  SELF-EVIDENT
... YOU MUST FIRST CONNECT  AND THE COMPANY THAT CONNECTS  MORE OF THE WORLD IS A LEADER IN COMMUNICATION NETWORK
I MAY NOT GET TO THE MOUNTAIN  TOP OF THE WI-FI BUT I WILL BE  FREE AT LAST.
Jon: NICELY DONE.
