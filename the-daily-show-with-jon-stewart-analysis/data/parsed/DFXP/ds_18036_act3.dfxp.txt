(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FINE ONE,  STARS IN SHOW TIME'S "THE BIG  C."  HER NEW FILM IS CALLED "HYDE PARK ON THE HUDSON."
IS MY WIFE BEHAVING HERSELF?
YES.
HAS MY MOTHER CALMED DOWN?
SHE'S FINE.
IT'S LIKE A MAD HOUSE.
DON'T WORRY. ALL'S QUIET ON THE UPSTAIRS  FRONT. YOU LOOK YOUNGER THAN I'D  IMAGINED. FOR A KING, YOU KNOW?
HE S HE?
THEY BOTH SEEM NERVOUS. THAT SURPRISED ME.
WITHOUT SOME HELP FROM US,  DAISY, THERE MIGHT NOT BE AN  ENGLAND TO BE KING OF.
Jon: F.D.R.'S GETTING  HAMMERED. (LAUGHTER)  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM LAURA LINNEY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME.
PLEASE, YOU KNOW, I LOVE  THESE HISTORICAL FILMS OFTEN  TIMES THEY ARE FANTASY AND  FICTION. THIS IS BASED ON THIS WOMAN'S  DIARY.
PART OF IT, YES. ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. THE MOVIE TAKES PLACE OVER ONE  WEEKEND AND THERE IS A SORT OF A  POETIC LICENSE GIVEN WITH TIME AND DATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. HOWEVER THE WOMAN WHO I PLAY IS  SOMEONE WHO I HAD NEVER HEARD OF  BEFORE, MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT SHE EVEN EXISTED. AND IT WAS DAISY SUCKLEY AND SHE  WAS F.D.R.'S COUSIN AND VERY,  VERY CLOSE CONFIDANTE.
Jon: YES.
YES! YES!
Jon: AND IN THE DAY  CONFIDANTE, OBVIOUSLY --
(LAUGHS)  WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS THIS WOMAN LIVED TO BE 100 YEARS OLD  AND SHE ALWAYS SORT OF -- SHE  WAS A REAL WALL FLOWER. NO ONE TOOK HER SERIOUSLY. SHE ALWAYS FEIGNED IGNORANCE TO  ANYTHING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. THAT SHE WAS JUST A COUSIN AND  HELPED KEEP HIM COMPANY AND THEN  WHEN SHE DIED AT 100 UNDER HER BED WAS A LITTLE -L -L SUITCASE  FILLED WITH LETTERS. FILLED. LETTERS AND DIARIES THAT THEIR  RELATIONSHIP WAS MUCH MORE  EXTENSIVE THAN ANYONE UNDERSTOOD AND WAS NON-PLATONIC.
Jon: DID YOU HAVE AN  OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THESE?
I SAW THE SUITCASE! (LAUGHS)
Jon: DID CHEF A SAM SON  NIGHT?
HER HOME IS THIS AMAZING  MUSEUM THAT MOST PEOPLE ALSO  DON'T KNOW ABOUT WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO HYDE PARK YOU CAN GO  THERE AND LEARN ABOUT DAISY AND  HER FAMILY. IT'S A MAGNIFICENT PLACE TO GO. THE LETTERS ARE AT THE  PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AT HYDE  PARK.
Jon: DOES SHE HAVE  SURVIVING FAMILY MEMBERS LIKE  CHILDREN?
NO, NO, SHE WAS SINGLE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WHAT AN AMAZING --
AMAZING. BUT SHE WOKE UP -- THE PEOPLE  WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LET ME INTO  HER BEDROOM WHICH IS STILL EXACTLY THE WAY IT WAS WHEN SHE  DIED AND SHE LIVED IN A -- SHE  SLEPT IN A SINGLE BED AND WOKE UP EVERY MORNING AND THE FIRST  THING SHE SAW WAS A HUGE  LITHOGRAPH OF F.D.R. NEXT TO THAT WAS A PLACE FILLED  WITH KNICKKNACKS, STUFF HE WOULD  GET UP --
Jon: WHAT'S A IT HAVE  STPHRAOEPB.
LIKE A GLASS CABINET. WITH SHELVES.
Jon: KNICKKNACKS HE  BROUGHTER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: BUT THINGS LIKE HE'S  IN AN AIRPORT LIKE "OH, I BETTER  RAB A SHOT GLASS."G
EXACTLY. LITTLE THING SHE IS PLACED IN A  SHRINE. AND WHEN I FOUND OUT SHE'S THE  ONE WHO GAVE HIM THE DOG WHICH  HE WAS SO ASSOCIATED WITH. AND I NEVER -- WHEN I FOUND --  THAT WAS THE ONE BIT OF  INFORMATION THAT -- I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SHOCKED ME SO MUCH BUT I  JUST ASSUMED IT WAS A FAMILY  DOG.
Jon: THERE'S AN INTIMACY TO  GIVING SOMEONE A DOG, I THINK,  THAT SURPASSES EVEN THAT TYPE OF ILLICIT AFFAIR.
YEAH.
Jon: I'M AMAZING THAT  ELEANOR, BEING THE WOMAN THAT  SHE WAS, SHE WOULD ALLOW ALL THAT OTHER STUFF. I WOULD THINK SHE WOULD DRAW THE  LINE --
WITH THE DOG. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I KNOW THAT SOUND  STRANGE BUT I CAN SEE THAT THAT  WOULD BE A DEAL BREAKER.
I THINK AT THAT POINT F.D.R. WAS KNOWN TO HAVE MANY  FRIENDSHIPS WITH MANY WOMEN AND  THERE WAS A --
Jon: THERE'S MUSEUMS ALL  OVER. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S TRUE.
Jon: THERE'S A BUNCH OF  LITHOGRAPHS OF F.D.R. ALL OVER.
HE WOULD SIGN THEM.
Jon: EXACTLY.
THERE WAS A CONSTELLATION OF  WOMEN AROUND HIM AND THEY EACH  HAD VERY DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES AND THEY EACH -- HOW SEXUAL SOME  OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS WERE IS  UP FOR NEGOTIATIONS SO TO SPEAK.
Jon: I'M SURE IT WAS. (LAUGHTER)  I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT THEY TALKED  ABOUT AT YALTA. LISTEN, DID ELEANOR -- YOU KNOW,  -- THERE'S SO MUCH TO GET INTO  THAT WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME ABOUT THE KING COMING THERE TO  VISIT THEM THIS IS 1939, WE HAD  NOT ENTERED THE WAR. THIS WAS THEIR IDEA TO GET US  INVOLVED. WAS IT SUCCESSFUL?
PROFOUNDLY SUCCESSFUL AND A  PERIOD OF TIME WHEN IT'S HARD  FOR ME TO EVEN REALIZE IT THAT THE U.S. DIDN'T LIKE BRITAIN  VERY MUCH AT ALL.
WE'RE NERVOUS ABOUT GETTING  ENTANGLED.
Jon: AND NO ROYAL HAD EVER  STEPPED FOOT IN THE UNITED  STATES BEFORE. SO THEY CAME FOR A WEEKEND TO  TRY TO GET SUPPORT FROM F.D.R. TO GO AND JOIN THEM THE WAR  EFFORT AND F.D.R. VERY SHREWDLY  THREW A PICNIC AND HAD THE KING EAT A HOT DOG. (LAUGHTER)  AND IT WAS THAT MOMENT THAT  CHANGED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN  THE COUNT TWO COUNTRIES. IT'S CRAZY.
Jon: EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA  WILL DO THAT. (LAUGHTER)  I'M TELLING YOU, YOU HAVE TO GO  SEE IT. BILL MURRAY'S GREAT, YOU'RE  GREAT, EVERYBODY. IT'S TERRIFIC. IT'S CALLED "HYDE PARK ON THE  HUDSON."  YOU HAVE TO SEE IT. LAURA LINNEY, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
