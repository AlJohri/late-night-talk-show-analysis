<p begin="00:00:32.566" end="00:00:37.237">THE STOCK MARKET, A TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED TO THE STOCK MARKET.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.237" end="00:00:39.640">IT WENT DOWN 600 POINTS ON NEWS OF EUROPE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.640" end="00:00:44.378">THEN THE NEXT DAY FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND EUROPE WAS STILL VERY SIMILAR TO HOW IT HAD </p>
<p begin="00:00:44.378" end="00:00:46.113">BEEN THE DAY BEFORE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.113" end="00:00:47.981">AND IT WENT UP 500 POINTS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.981" end="00:00:52.719">THEN THE NEXT DAY IT WENT DOWN 450 POINTS ON NEWS OF SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.719" end="00:00:55.389">AND THEN THE NEXT DAY IT WENT UP 300.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.389" end="00:00:57.624">ARE THEY (BEEP) WITH US?</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.624" end="00:01:01.228">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S EXACTLY RIGHT WHAT YOU&apos;RE SAYING BECAUSE THE COMPANIES THAT </p>
<p begin="00:01:01.228" end="00:01:02.963">MAKE UP THE STOCK MARKET DIDN&apos;T CHANGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.963" end="00:01:08.635">THEY WEREN&apos;T WORTH 5% LESS THE NEXT DAY AND THEY WEREN&apos;T WORTH 3% MORE AFTER THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.635" end="00:01:10.070">THAT&apos;S EXACTLY RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.070" end="00:01:13.407">THE STOCK MARKET IS THE COLLECTION OF A VALUE OF UNDERLYING COMPANIES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.407" end="00:01:16.977">THAT&apos;S WHAT THE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE, BUT THE STOCK MARKET HAS BEEN A BAROMETER OF </p>
<p begin="00:01:16.977" end="00:01:20.314">HOW INVESTORS AROUND THE WORLD KIND OF FEEL ABOUT THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.314" end="00:01:23.483">THAT&apos;S THE STUFF YOU&apos;VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.483" end="00:01:24.818">&gt;&gt; Jon: MORE OF A MOOD RING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.818" end="00:01:26.887">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.887" end="00:01:30.457">IT&apos;S A MOOD RING WITH A BIG BOARD THAT YOU CAN WATCH ALL THE TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.457" end="00:01:35.762">&gt;&gt; Jon: HAVE WE GOTTEN TO THE POINT, ARE WE TOO HOOKED INTO THIS IDEA OF THE STOCK MARKET </p>
<p begin="00:01:35.762" end="00:01:38.699">AS A PERMANENT THERMOMETER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.699" end="00:01:39.166">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.166" end="00:01:43.103">&gt;&gt; Jon: OF THE HEALTH OF OUR NATION, ECONOMICALLY AND OTHERWISE.</p>

<p begin="00:01:45.672" end="00:01:46.206">IT&apos;S ONE MEASURE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.206" end="00:01:52.579">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT IS A MEASURE THAT WOULD PERHAPS OR IS IT JUST TOO COMPLICATED TO REALLY SHOW </p>
<p begin="00:01:52.579" end="00:01:58.886">GRAPHICALLY TO TELEVISION VIEWERS, WHAT WOULD GIVE US A BETTER SENSE OF THE UNDERLYING HEALTH?</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.886" end="00:02:01.755">&gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE A REAL FEEL FOR THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.755" end="00:02:03.957">REALLY WE ALL FEEL IT IN OUR LIVES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.957" end="00:02:08.562">THE THREE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL PROSPEROUS IN YOUR LIFE ARE THE VALUE OF YOUR </p>
<p begin="00:02:08.562" end="00:02:09.930">INVESTMENTS GOING UP IF YOU HAVE INVESTMENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.930" end="00:02:11.098">THAT&apos;S THE STOCK MARKET.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.098" end="00:02:13.700">NUMBER TWO THE VALUE OF YOUR HOME GOING UP IF YOU HAVE A HOME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.700" end="00:02:16.703">BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY LIVE WITHOUT INVESTMENTS AND A HOME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.703" end="00:02:18.071">YOU CAN&apos;T LIVE WITHOUT AN INCOME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.071" end="00:02:24.811">SO YOUR JOB AND THE IDEA THAT YOU WILL EARN AND CONTINUE TO EARN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.811" end="00:02:26.713">THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.713" end="00:02:29.583">THE DEBT CEILING IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.583" end="00:02:32.119">EMPLOYMENT OR UNEMPLOYMENT THAT WE HAVE NOW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.119" end="00:02:34.121">THAT&apos;S WHAT YOU FEEL GOOD OR BAD ABOUT.</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.905" end="00:02:53.674">TALKING ABOUT THAT, WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT JOBS.</p>

<p begin="00:02:54.708" end="00:02:57.678">THEY KEEP SAYING WE SHOULD REALLY BE TALKING ABOUT JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.678" end="00:02:58.712">LET&apos;S TALK ABOUT JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.712" end="00:03:04.852">WHAT CAN THEY ACTUALLY DO ABOUT JOBS AND IS THAT JUST A KUJAL THEY USE TO SHUT THE OTHER PERSON UP?</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.852" end="00:03:06.954">IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO?</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.954" end="00:03:10.390">IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT THEY USED TO DO WITH TERRORISM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.390" end="00:03:13.927">WE SHOULDN&apos;T BE TALKING ABOUT THIS WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT TERRORISM IF THEY </p>

<p begin="00:03:31.545" end="00:03:37.384">INTO THIS RIDICULOUS DEBT CEILING DEBATE WENT INTO HOW DID WE ACTUALLY GET JOBS CREATED?</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.384" end="00:03:41.388">GOVERNMENT CAN&apos;T CREATE JOBS UNLESS IT&apos;S A STIMULUS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HIRE PEOPLE TO </p>
<p begin="00:03:41.388" end="00:03:46.093">DO THINGS BUT THEY CAN CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR COMPANIES TO HIRE PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.093" end="00:03:48.962">THAT MIGHT BE WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.962" end="00:03:50.097">REDUCING PAYROLL TAXES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.097" end="00:03:52.566">GENERALLY ACCOMMODATING BUSINESSES THAT MIGHT HIRE SOMEBODY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.566" end="00:03:55.302">ULTIMATELY YOU DON&apos;T HIRE SOMEBODY UNLESS THERE&apos;S DEMAND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.302" end="00:03:59.406">BUT NUMBER THREE WE HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE NOT </p>

<p begin="00:04:12.452" end="00:04:14.221">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO WOULD RETRAIN IT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.221" end="00:04:15.189">&gt;&gt; IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.189" end="00:04:19.226">THERE ARE COMPANIES, COLLEGES THAT DO THIS OR YOU GO TO A COLLEGE TO BECOME A NURSE IF </p>
<p begin="00:04:19.226" end="00:04:20.594">YOU WERE A MANUFACTURING WORKER.</p>

<p begin="00:04:22.896" end="00:04:26.733">&gt;&gt; WHAT IF THE GOVERNMENT COULD GUARANTEE THE COST OF THAT TRANSFORMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.733" end="00:04:28.368">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU&apos;RE A SOCIALIST?</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.368" end="00:04:31.138">&gt;&gt; MA WHAT IF THE BANKS DO IT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.138" end="00:04:32.072">THE BANKS CAN DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.072" end="00:04:34.808">I CAN TELL YOU WHAT IT WOULD COST TO REINVENT YOURSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.808" end="00:04:38.545">WHAT IF YOU CAN TAKE THAT CALCULATION AND SAY IT&apos;S GOING COST ME THAT MUCH MONEY AND </p>
<p begin="00:04:38.545" end="00:04:42.382">I&apos;M GOING TO MAKE THIS MUCH MORE AND PAY TAXES FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.382" end="00:04:44.484">WHY NOT FINANCE THAT TRANSFORMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.484" end="00:04:46.954">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN I HEAR YOU SPEAK YOU SOUND RATIONAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.954" end="00:04:48.155">THIS SOUNDS DO-ABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.155" end="00:04:51.625">IT DOES NOT SOUND IDEOLOGICALLY INSANE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.625" end="00:04:57.397">IT SOUNDS LIKE A MIXTURE OF SOME SUGGESTIONS AND REMEDIES FROM DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE AISLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.397" end="00:05:01.902">WHAT IS IT ABOUT GETTING SOMETHING LIKE THAT DONE AND YOU&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:01.902" end="00:05:07.274">PUBLIC SECTOR BECAUSE THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS FREE TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.274" end="00:05:10.043">WHAT IS HOLDING THIS UP?</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.043" end="00:05:11.078">WHAT IS THE OBSTACLE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.078" end="00:05:13.947">IS IT ALL SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.947" end="00:05:19.486">&gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK WHAT WE&apos;VE DONE IS WE ARE NOW SORT OF 25 YEARS INTO THIS IDEA ABOUT HOW </p>
<p begin="00:05:19.486" end="00:05:23.290">GOVERNMENT IS... INTERFERES IN YOUR LIFE AND IS BAD FOR YOUR LIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.290" end="00:05:27.361">NOW WE&apos;VE GOT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO CONGRESS ON THE BASIS THAT THEY WILL BE </p>

<p begin="00:06:02.796" end="00:06:06.333">THERE&apos;S ALSO SOME TRUTH TO THE FACT THAT RIGHT NOW WOULDN&apos;T BE A GREAT TIME TO RAISE TAXES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.333" end="00:06:11.038">BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS THERE TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE AROUND </p>
