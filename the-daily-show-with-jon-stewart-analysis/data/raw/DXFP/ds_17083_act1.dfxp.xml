<p begin="00:03:30.577" end="00:03:38.418">PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF MAKING SURE THE GOVERNMENT DOESN&apos;T WASTE A TON OF MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.418" end="00:03:43.557">LIKE THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL HOLDING A CONFERENCE IN ANDY DICKEY JACUZZI.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.557" end="00:03:53.000">(LAUGHTER) IT&apos;S LIKE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SELLING GUNS TO MEXICAN DRUG DEALERS.</p>
