<p begin="00:01:51.912" end="00:01:54.681">MEGYN KELLY IS A BAD-ASS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.681" end="00:01:58.785">THAT GUY-- THAT GUY WAS CALLING MATERNITY LEAVE A RACKET.</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.361" end="00:02:10.797">SHE&apos;S MAKING CATE A SPIRITED ARGUMENT THAT, WITHOUTERS ARE ENTITLED TO CERTAIN </p>
<p begin="00:02:10.797" end="00:02:15.469">BENEFITS AND SOCIETY HAS AN INTEREST IN PROTECTING THESE BENEFITS WHICH IS GREAT.</p>

<p begin="00:02:27.114" end="00:02:29.082">PLACED INTO OUR LIVES OUT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.082" end="00:02:33.220">ARE WE JUST STUCK WITH THESE MASSIVE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.220" end="00:02:35.889">&gt;&gt; Jon: SHE USED TO HATE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM,</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.889" end="00:02:37.991">MANDATED BENEFITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.991" end="00:02:43.096">SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEGYN KELLY COMING OFF MATERNITY LEAVE AND SOME OF HER </p>
<p begin="00:02:43.096" end="00:02:43.797">EARLIER WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.797" end="00:02:47.935">&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT ABOUT GETTING PREGNANT AND CARRYING A BABY NINE MONTHS THAT YOU DON&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:02:47.935" end="00:02:51.672">THINK DESERVES A FEW MONTHS OFF SO BONDING AND RECOVERY CAN TAKE PLACE, HUH?</p>

<p begin="00:02:56.777" end="00:03:00.180">SO TO TRY TO TAKE THEM WAY NOW IS LIKE TRYING TO TAKE SOCIAL SECURITY AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.180" end="00:03:01.048">&gt;&gt; VERY TOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.048" end="00:03:03.283">&gt;&gt; ONCE IT IN HOW DO YOU GET RID OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.283" end="00:03:05.686">&gt;&gt; THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT DOESN&apos;T REQUIRE PAID LEAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.686" end="00:03:09.089">&gt;&gt; THE FREE MARKET SHOULD DICTATE THAT IS HOW IT WORKS IN AMERICAN SOCIETY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.089" end="00:03:12.793">IF ANYTHING, THE UNITED STATES IS IN THE DARK AGES WHEN IT COMES TO MATERNITY LEAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.793" end="00:03:14.595">A LOT OF OUR VIEWERS DON&apos;T SEE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.595" end="00:03:18.298">THEY SEE IT AS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS SOCIALISM, THE CREATION OF A WELL FARE STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.298" end="00:03:20.334">&gt;&gt; WELL, DO MEN GET MATERNITY LEAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.334" end="00:03:20.667">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>

<p begin="00:03:25.539" end="00:03:30.611">IF MEN WOULD LIKE TO TAKE-- THREE MONTHS OFF TO GO TAKE CARE OF THEIR NEWBORN BABY THEY CAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.611" end="00:03:34.681">CORRECT ME IF I&apos;M WRONG, BUT DON&apos;T THEY CALL IT MATERNITY LEAVE FOR A REASON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.681" end="00:03:44.224">HOW IS THIS DISCRIMINATORY TO GIVE LESS TIME TO THE MAN WHO DIDN&apos;T HAVE THE BABY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.224" end="00:03:46.660">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:03:46.660" end="00:03:49.696">&gt;&gt; Jon: I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.</p>

<p begin="00:04:03.377" end="00:04:06.747">SEE THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH ENTITLEMENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.747" end="00:04:10.684">THEY ARE REALLY ONLY ENTITLEMENTS WHEN THEY ARE SOMETHING OTHER PEOPLE WANT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.684" end="00:04:12.786">WHEN IT&apos;S SOMETHING YOU WANT,</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.786" end="00:04:14.788">THEY&apos;RE A HALLMARK OF A CIVILIZED SOCIETY.</p>
