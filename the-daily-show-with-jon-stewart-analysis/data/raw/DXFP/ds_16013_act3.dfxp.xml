<p begin="00:00:01.335" end="00:00:06.273">&gt;&gt; Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT WRITES THE CURRENT COLUMN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.273" end="00:00:12.012">HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED INDIA CALLING, THE INTIMATE PORTRAIT OF A NATION&apos;S REMAKING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.012" end="00:00:15.349">PLEASE WELCOME HIM TO THE PROGRAM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.349" end="00:00:20.621">HELLO, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.621" end="00:00:21.655">NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.655" end="00:00:22.356">&gt;&gt; GREAT TO BE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.356" end="00:00:23.824">&gt;&gt; Reporter: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.824" end="00:00:26.994">THE BOOK IS CALLED INDIA CALLING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.994" end="00:00:28.428">IT&apos;S AMAZING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.428" end="00:00:30.564">YOU WERE BORN IN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.564" end="00:00:32.399">&gt;&gt; CLEVELAND, OHIO.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:34.601">&gt;&gt; Reporter: I THOUGHT IT WAS SHAKER HEIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.601" end="00:00:35.903">&gt;&gt; A SUBURB OF CLEVELAND.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.903" end="00:00:37.704">&gt;&gt; Reporter: SHAKER HEIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.704" end="00:00:40.607">YOUR PARENTS FIRST GENERATION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.607" end="00:00:45.379">YOU DECIDE AT 21 TO GO BACK TO INDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.379" end="00:00:46.713">TO DO WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.713" end="00:00:51.652">&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, AS A CHILD I HAD GROWN UP HATING INDIA BECAUSE IT WAS THIS KIND </p>
<p begin="00:00:51.652" end="00:00:54.621">OF STAGNANT, DEAD, STIFLING COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.621" end="00:00:59.693">SOMETIME WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I REALIZED THAT SOMETHING HAD CHANGED AND I HADN&apos;T KEPT UP </p>
<p begin="00:00:59.693" end="00:01:00.527">TO DATE WITH IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.527" end="00:01:03.797">THE COUNTRY THEY LEFT WAS MAYBE SOMETHING THAT I NEEDED TO GO AND UNDERSTAND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.797" end="00:01:07.000">SO I MOVED BACK RIGHT AFTER I FINISHED COLLEGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.000" end="00:01:11.872">&gt;&gt; Reporter: NOW DO YOU FEEL LIKE INDIA HAD CHANGED DRAMATICALLY OR ALSO YOUR </p>
<p begin="00:01:11.872" end="00:01:14.274">PERCEPTION OF IT OR IS IT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.274" end="00:01:15.475">&gt;&gt; THE OVERLAP OF THE TWO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.475" end="00:01:19.446">I THINK WHEN YOU&apos;RE A CHILD THE ONLY THING YOU DON&apos;T WANT IS TO BE DIFFERENT FROM PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.446" end="00:01:25.085">A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS FEEL WITH FIRST GENERATION FAMILIES AND KIDS PUSH THAT AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.085" end="00:01:26.920">I PUSHED IT AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.920" end="00:01:30.557">IT WAS PARTLY THAT AND WHERE INDIA WAS IN THE WORLD AT THAT STAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.557" end="00:01:34.094">NO ONE WAS PUTTING IT ON THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINES OR TALKING ABOUT IT AS A GREAT </p>
<p begin="00:01:34.094" end="00:01:37.231">SUPER POWER, NO ONE WAS GOING TO STATE DINNERS IN WASHINGTON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.231" end="00:01:42.069">IT WAS A PLACE THAT FELT TO ME BETTER NOT TO BE FROM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.069" end="00:01:44.438">BY THE TIME I WAS IN COLLEGE YOU BECOME MORE SECURE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.438" end="00:01:45.239">INDIA HAD CHANGED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.239" end="00:01:47.541">IT HAD ACTUALLY CHANGED ON THE GROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.541" end="00:01:48.475">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOUR PARENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.475" end="00:01:53.380">I&apos;M JUST IMAGINING, OKAY, THIS SON, MY GRANDPARENTS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.380" end="00:01:57.985">IF I HAD TOLD THEM I WAS GOING BACK TO THE PLACE THAT THEY HAD WORKED SO DAMNED HARD TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:57.985" end="00:02:01.288">GET OUT OF IT, PASSIVE AGGRESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE MENU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.288" end="00:02:03.190">IT WOULD HAVE BEEN, SURE, GO BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.190" end="00:02:04.358">WHY NOT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.358" end="00:02:05.392">I&apos;M FINE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.392" end="00:02:06.059">I&apos;M FINE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.059" end="00:02:10.430">JUST PUT IT A DAGGER THROUGH MY SKULL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.430" end="00:02:13.100">DID YOU RECEIVE ANY PUSH-BACK FROM YOUR PARENTS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.100" end="00:02:18.038">&gt;&gt; NOT MUCH UNTIL THE DAY MY SISTER WAS WORKING AT GOOGLE AT THE TIME IN CALIFORNIA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.038" end="00:02:20.274">AND I WAS ALREADY OUT IN INDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.274" end="00:02:24.178">SHE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO POTENTIALLY DO THE SAME THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.178" end="00:02:30.684">AND I THINK THAT THE PROSPECT OF A DOUBLE WHAMMIE WAS TOO MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.684" end="00:02:34.788">KIND OF REVERSE IMMIGRATION DOUBLE WHAMMIE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.788" end="00:02:39.826">YOU I.M.ED ME ONE DAY AND SAID WHAT AM I DOING HERE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.826" end="00:02:41.195">IT NEVER REALLY CAME UP AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.195" end="00:02:44.731">SHE WONDERED WITH A ARE WE DOING HERE IF WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING....</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.731" end="00:02:46.600">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY CAME TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.600" end="00:02:49.002">YOU WERE THE EMBODIMENT OF THEIR AMERICAN DREAM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.002" end="00:02:53.407">YOU WERE NOW GOING BACK BECAUSE THE AMERICAN DREAM WAS STILL ALIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.407" end="00:02:55.275">IT WAS JUST ALIVE IN INDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.275" end="00:02:56.210">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S THE CONFUSION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.210" end="00:03:05.152">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT DID YOU FIND, YOU KNOW, INDIA&apos;S CASTE SYSTEM SEEMINGLY HAS BEEN THE BULWARK </p>
<p begin="00:03:05.152" end="00:03:08.288">AGAINST THE TYPE OF UPWARD MOBILITY THAT YOU&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.288" end="00:03:09.089">IS THAT GONE NOW?</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.089" end="00:03:15.362">&gt;&gt; CASTE WAS THE ONLY THING THAT EVERYBODY SAID ABOUT THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.362" end="00:03:17.064">IT WAS LIKE RACE IN THIS COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.064" end="00:03:19.666">IT WAS THE MOST PROFOUND FACT ABOUT THE PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.666" end="00:03:24.271">IN A WAY IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE IDEA BEHIND CASTES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.271" end="00:03:25.639">IT DOESN&apos;T MATTER WHAT YOU DO,</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.639" end="00:03:29.009">HOW SMART YOU ARE OR WHO YOU ARE, YOUR FATHER AND GRANDFATHER AND YOU WILL OF </p>
<p begin="00:03:29.009" end="00:03:31.245">THE POSITIONS ALL THE WAY CONTROL THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.245" end="00:03:37.417">IF ANYTHING IS CHANGING IN TODAY&apos;S INDIA, IT IS THE LACK OF BELIEF IN THIS IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.417" end="00:03:39.386">PEOPLE ARE REJECTING THIS BELIEF.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.386" end="00:03:43.457">PEOPLE ARE BELIEVING THAT YOU SHOULD GET WHERE YOU ARE BASED ON WHAT YOU DO NOT WHO YOU ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.457" end="00:03:47.461">THAT IS A PROFOUND REVOLUTION THAT IS HAPPENING ONE INDIAN AT A TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.461" end="00:03:52.699">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU TALK ABOUT THIS KIND OF REVINDRA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.699" end="00:03:55.102">HE IS A CHARACTER SO MOTIVATED,</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.102" end="00:03:59.473">SO INDUSTRIOUS HE&apos;S THE TYPE OF GUY THAT YOU WOULD IMAGINE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE FIRST </p>
<p begin="00:03:59.473" end="00:04:01.642">PLANE OUT TO AMERICA 20 YEARS AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.642" end="00:04:06.346">BUT HE&apos;S CHOOSING TO STAY NOW IN INDIA AND USE HIS INDUSTRY THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.346" end="00:04:07.447">DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.447" end="00:04:10.017">&gt;&gt; HE IS THE CLASSIC SELF-MADE MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.017" end="00:04:14.788">AS YOU SAY HE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY DONE THAT SELF-MAKING IN NEW JERSEY OR CALIFORNIA A </p>
<p begin="00:04:14.788" end="00:04:15.689">GENERATION AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.689" end="00:04:18.392">HE WAS BORN IN A VILLAGE IN INDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.392" end="00:04:21.728">BUMPED UP AGAINST THE LIMITATIONS OF BEING FROM THAT VILLAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.728" end="00:04:26.166">AND THROUGH AN EXTRAORDINARY RUN OF EFFORT, OF SELF-EDUCATION THROUGH ALL </p>
<p begin="00:04:26.166" end="00:04:28.435">THESE HOLE IN THE WALL CLASSES PULLED HIMSELF OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.435" end="00:04:33.040">AT THE END OF THAT JOURNEY NOT ONLY DID HE NOT WANT TO GO TO AMERICA, WHICH HE DIDN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.040" end="00:04:36.210">HE DIDN&apos;T EVEN WANT TO GO THE BIGGEST CITIES IN INDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.210" end="00:04:36.944">I SAID WHY?</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.944" end="00:04:41.114">HE SAID WHEN COME FROM WHERE I COME FROM THE LOWEST OF THE LOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.114" end="00:04:42.749">IT&apos;S NOT JUST MONEY YOU WANT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.749" end="00:04:47.020">YOU WANT DIGNITY AND PEOPLE TO RESPECT YOU AND KNOW YOU AND SAY SIR TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.020" end="00:04:51.658">HE WANTED TO GO FROM THAT VILLAGE TO THE NEAREST TOWN WHERE HE HAD MORE OPPORTUNITY </p>
<p begin="00:04:51.658" end="00:04:54.127">BUT WHERE HE WAS STILL BIG BY THE STANDARDS OF THE TOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.127" end="00:04:58.131">HE DIDN&apos;T WANT TO GET LOST IN AMERICA OR EVEN IN THE BIGGER CITIESS OF INDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.131" end="00:05:02.369">&gt;&gt; Jon: AS YOU WATCH THE CHANGE TAKING PLACE IN YOUR MIND COMING FROM SHAKER </p>
<p begin="00:05:02.369" end="00:05:09.576">HEIGHTS OHIO AND GOING TO INDIA, DO YOU THINK AMERICA CAN STILL KICK THEIR ASS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.576" end="00:05:11.245">WHERE WERE YOU AT NOW?</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.245" end="00:05:13.914">ARE WE STILL IN AN ASS-KICK KG </p>
<p begin="00:05:13.914" end="00:05:18.151">&gt;&gt; I HAD A DIFFERENT ANSWER FOR COLBERT BUT FOR YOU....</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.151" end="00:05:21.855">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHING).</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.855" end="00:05:23.390">&gt;&gt; YOU GET THE REAL DEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.390" end="00:05:24.391">&gt;&gt; Jon: BREAK IT DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.391" end="00:05:25.092">LET ME HEAR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.092" end="00:05:30.197">&gt;&gt; WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS AND WE TALK ABOUT INDIA AND CHINA IN THIS COUNTRY, WE TALK ABOUT </p>
<p begin="00:05:30.197" end="00:05:31.365">AN ECONOMIC THREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.365" end="00:05:34.635">WE&apos;RE ALL OBSESSED WITH EMERGING MARKETS, RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.635" end="00:05:36.036">THE SAME THING WITH CHINA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.036" end="00:05:40.574">I THINK THE REAL THING AMERICANS SHOULD THINK ABOUT IS THESE COUNTRIES POSE A </p>
<p begin="00:05:40.574" end="00:05:44.444">CHALLENGE OF CULTURE AND SPIRIT BECAUSE IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE SEGMENT YOU DID ON </p>
<p begin="00:05:44.444" end="00:05:48.515">THE CULTURE AND DISCOURSE IN THIS COUNTRY, WE ARE ALL PULLING EACH OTHER DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.515" end="00:05:52.152">WE&apos;RE CREATING A CULTURE OF DESTRUCTION AND PULLING EACH OTHER DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.152" end="00:05:57.224">INDIA AND CHINA, FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT LIES AHEAD FOR THEM, ARE STARTING TO CREATE </p>
<p begin="00:05:57.224" end="00:06:01.461">CULTURES OF HOPE AND CULTURES OF CREATION WHERE THERE&apos;S A CONSENSUS ON THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.461" end="00:06:03.931">HOW DO WE CREATE SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY?</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.931" end="00:06:09.002">WE NEED TO BE WORRIED NOT ABOUT AN ECONOMIC THREAT BUT THE THREAT OF THAT SPIRIT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.002" end="00:06:10.571">IN ABOUT 2.5 BILLION PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.571" end="00:06:13.540">&gt;&gt; Jon: MAY I SUM UP THE INTERVIEW?</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.540" end="00:06:13.974">&gt;&gt; PLEASE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.974" end="00:06:16.877">&gt;&gt; Jon: UNITED WE STAND,</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.877" end="00:06:20.347">DIVIDED WE FALL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.347" end="00:06:21.014">AND IF I...</p>
