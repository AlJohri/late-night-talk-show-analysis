<p begin="00:02:57.511" end="00:03:01.748">A LITTLE BIT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, AND YOU KNOW, SHE&apos;LL MAKE IT WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.748" end="00:03:03.116">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.116" end="00:03:04.818">&gt;&gt; SOME WAYS WE ARE DOING HER A FAVOR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.818" end="00:03:08.255">SHE DOESN&apos;T WANT TO DIE WITH US RESENTING HER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.255" end="00:03:18.398">(LAUGHTER) ANIMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.398" end="00:03:21.602">THAT STILL DOESN&apos;T GET US ALL THE MONEY WE NEED.</p>

<p begin="00:03:26.573" end="00:03:31.078">MAYBE COKICK IN IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME, JUST A LITTLE EXTRA, NOT A LOT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.078" end="00:03:32.412">A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.412" end="00:03:36.316">WOULDN&apos;T MAKE A DENT IN HIS LIFESTYLE, NOT TO MENTION AT ONE POINT WE BAILED HIM OUT </p>
<p begin="00:03:36.316" end="00:03:38.218">WHEN HE WAS HAVING FINANCIAL TROUBLES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.218" end="00:03:40.521">YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT PLAN COULD WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.521" end="00:03:44.758">&gt;&gt; GOVERNMENTS MORE AND MORE WANT TO SUBSIDIZE FAILURE AND THEY WANT TO PUNISH SUCCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.758" end="00:03:47.127">&gt;&gt; SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING EVERYONE TO BE SUCCESSFUL,</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.127" end="00:03:50.230">EVERYONE TO BE WEALTHY, NOT PUNISH THOSE WHO ACHIEVE SUCCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.230" end="00:03:55.969">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, RIGHT, GIVING IT BACK TO THE TAX RATES OF THE 90s THAT WOULD BE PUNISHING </p>

<p begin="00:04:24.865" end="00:04:30.470">BUT DOES IT REALLY NEED TO HAVE NUCLEAR CAPABILITY AND STEALTH MODE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.470" end="00:04:33.440">WE ALREADY KILLED THE KID WITHOUT EGGED OUR HOUSE TEN YEARS AGO.</p>
