<p begin="00:00:06.707" end="00:00:11.879">MY GUEST TONIGHT AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED RETIREMENT </p>
<p begin="00:00:11.879" end="00:00:16.250">HEISTS, HOW COMPANIES PLUNDER AND PROFIT FROM THE NEST EGGS OF AMERICAN WORKERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.250" end="00:00:19.353">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ELLEN SCHULTZ.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.353" end="00:00:26.059">( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.059" end="00:00:27.294">&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR HAVING ME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.294" end="00:00:29.596">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED RETIREMENT HEIST.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.596" end="00:00:33.667">I DID NOT THINK... AND I&apos;VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THIS FINANCIAL CRISIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.667" end="00:00:36.603">I DID NOT THINK THERE WAS ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT I CAN LEARN THAT COULD </p>
<p begin="00:00:36.603" end="00:00:40.107">STILL MAKE ME ANGRY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.107" end="00:00:42.209">THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.209" end="00:00:43.210">&gt;&gt; ANY TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.210" end="00:00:47.114">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW I CAN STILL FEEL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.114" end="00:00:56.256">THIS BOOK IS ABOUT HOW CORPORATIONS HAVE TAKEN GIGANTIC WORKER PENSION FUNDS AND JUST TAKEN THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.256" end="00:01:01.695">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;VE MANAGEDED TO TAKE THE RETIREMENT PLANS FOR MILLIONS, 44 MILLION PEOPLE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.695" end="00:01:04.398">AND TURN THEM INTO PROFIT CENTERS FOR THE COMPANIES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.398" end="00:01:08.569">NOW PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING THAT THE PLANS ARE UNDERFUNDED BUT THEY WERE FULLY FUNDED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.569" end="00:01:13.440">IN FACT THERE WAS A QUARTER TRILLION SURPLUS AS RECENTLY AS TEN YEARS AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.440" end="00:01:15.275">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT WOULD THEY DO?</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.275" end="00:01:17.811">YOU SAY THE PENSION FUND HAS A SURPLUS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.811" end="00:01:20.848">THAT MEANS THE COMPANY, THE WORKERS PAY INTO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.848" end="00:01:24.484">THERE&apos;S A MANDATE THAT YOU HAVE TO FUND THESE PENSIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.484" end="00:01:26.687">SO THEY HAVE A QUARTER TRILLION SURPLUS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.687" end="00:01:28.522">HOW DID THEY DRAIN THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.522" end="00:01:29.857">WHAT DID THEY DO?</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.857" end="00:01:31.458">&gt;&gt; A NUMBER OF THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.458" end="00:01:36.096">THEY SYPHONED MONEY OUT TO PAY FOR RESTRUCTURING, I.E.,</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.096" end="00:01:37.397">GETTING RID OF OLD PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.397" end="00:01:40.634">THEY USED SOME OF IT TO PAY THEIR EXECUTIVES, PARACHUTES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.634" end="00:01:43.704">&gt;&gt; Jon: IF YOU GET A GOLDEN PARACHUTE AS THEY CALL IT,</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.704" end="00:01:47.741">THAT MONEY COMES OUT OF THE PENSION FUND THAT THEY HAVE SET ASIDE FOR WORKERS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.741" end="00:01:48.976">&gt;&gt; THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THAT,</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.976" end="00:01:49.443">YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.443" end="00:01:51.745">IT&apos;S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF REALLY TRICKY LOOPHOLES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.745" end="00:01:55.449">THEY ACTUALLY ALSO SOLD US IN DEALS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.449" end="00:02:00.153">&gt;&gt; Jon: M-AND-A, OBVIOUSLY YOU AND ARE INSIDERS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.153" end="00:02:02.823">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M SORRY ABOUT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.823" end="00:02:06.693">YOU COULD SELL A UNIT AND THEN JUST SELL THEM SOME OF THE EXTRA PENSION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.693" end="00:02:10.063">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU WOULD, LET&apos;S SAY, COME IN AND BUY A COMPANY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.063" end="00:02:14.768">AND PART OF THAT COMPANY IS WE HAVE $2 BILLION IN PENSION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.768" end="00:02:16.803">AND YOU TAKE THAT AND DO WHAT WITH IT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.803" end="00:02:21.074">&gt;&gt; YOU TAKE IT BUT THEN YOU GET ANOTHER $500 MILLION EXTRA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.074" end="00:02:23.477">YOU JUST PAY 7 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.477" end="00:02:27.281">&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU DON&apos;T PAY THEM THE PENSIONS THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO GET.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.281" end="00:02:29.349">YOU PAY THEM LESS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.349" end="00:02:32.119">AND THAT EXTRA MONEY YOU PUT ON YOUR LEDGER AS PROFIT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.119" end="00:02:35.556">&gt;&gt; YOU CAN KEEP SOME OF THAT EXTRA MONEY, YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.556" end="00:02:42.095">TRUE, ALL OF THESE MECHANISMS COMPANIES TOOK WHAT WAS REALLY A PERFECTLY HEALTHY SYSTEM AND </p>
<p begin="00:02:42.095" end="00:02:43.864">JUST RAN THEM INTO THE ROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.864" end="00:02:45.933">THEY&apos;RE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE COST OF THE RETIREES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.933" end="00:02:49.536">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY CAN YOU DO THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.536" end="00:02:52.439">&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE ARE LOTS OF CLEVER LOOPHOLES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.439" end="00:02:57.744">AND COMPANIES HAVE CONVINCED CONGRESS TO LET THEM DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS OVER THE YEARS </p>
<p begin="00:02:57.744" end="00:02:59.646">CLAIMING IT WAS GOOD FOR RETIREMENT SECURITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.646" end="00:03:03.383">WHAT&apos;S REALLY DISAPPOINTING IS THAT WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS FOR EVERYBODY, THEY WERE </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.383" end="00:03:08.055">BOOSTING THE PENSIONS FOR THE EXECUTIVES SO ALL OF THESE CHANGES WHICH DECIMATED THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:08.055" end="00:03:13.694">RETIREMENT PLANS FOR MILLIONS WERE BOOSTING THE PAY AND THE PENSIONS FOR THE TOP 1%.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.694" end="00:03:19.066">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT MAKES ME WANT TO A (BEEP) ON A POLICE CAR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.066" end="00:03:21.068">AND I SAY THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.068" end="00:03:28.709">I KNOW THE POLICE ARE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.709" end="00:03:36.250">(GRUNTING) WHY ISN&apos;T THIS MORE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.250" end="00:03:40.487">IT&apos;S SURPRISING TO ME THAT THIS ENORMOUS... ALL WE&apos;VE HEARD ABOUT IS THESE </p>
<p begin="00:03:40.487" end="00:03:45.526">CORPORATIONS HAVING TO RENEGOTIATE WITH THEIR WORKERS THE IDEA THAT YOUR RETIREMENT </p>
<p begin="00:03:45.526" end="00:03:49.997">FUND IS THE ALBATROSS AROUND THE COMPANY&apos;S NECK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.997" end="00:03:53.734">&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE MANAGED TO KEEP THIS PRETTY QUIET OVER THE YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.734" end="00:04:00.073">IT&apos;S COMPLICATED MANEUVERS AND COMPANIES HAVE DELIBERATELY DECEIVED PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.073" end="00:04:04.244">THEY&apos;VE DECEIVED THE EMPLOYEES AND CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.244" end="00:04:05.846">I&apos;LL GIVE YOU ON AN EXAMPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.846" end="00:04:10.584">ONE WAY THEY FINANCE THESE HUGE EXECUTIVE PENSIONS WHICH SOME COMPANIES LIKE GE IS IS </p>
<p begin="00:04:10.584" end="00:04:11.752">UP TO $6 BILLION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.752" end="00:04:14.288">&gt;&gt; Jon: UP TO $6 BILLION IN?</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.288" end="00:04:15.355">&gt;&gt; EXECUTIVE PENSIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.355" end="00:04:17.724">&gt;&gt; Jon: $6 BILLION IN EXECUTIVE PENSIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.724" end="00:04:20.127">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S HOW MUCH THEY OWE THEIR EXECUTIVES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.127" end="00:04:21.061">&gt;&gt; Jon: $6 BILLION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.061" end="00:04:22.329">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.329" end="00:04:23.130">THEY EARNED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.130" end="00:04:25.766">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW MANY EXECUTIVES?</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.766" end="00:04:27.968">DO THEY HAVE SIX BILLION EXECUTIVES?</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.968" end="00:04:33.440">&gt;&gt; THEY DON&apos;T DISCLOSE IT BUT WHAT THEY OWE THEM IS ABOUT 15% OF WHAT THEY TO 500,000.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:36.944">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT COUNTS AGAINST EVERYBODY ELSE&apos;S FUNDED PENSIONS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.944" end="00:04:39.246">&gt;&gt; IT COUNTS AS PART OF THE LIABILITY, SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.246" end="00:04:44.318">SO WHEN COMPANIES COMPLAIN ABOUT THEIR COSTLY RETIREES THEY OFTEN DON&apos;T POINT OUT THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:44.318" end="00:04:47.421">FACT THAT IT&apos;S THE EXECUTIVES THAT ARE COSTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.421" end="00:04:54.194">LIKE OMNI CARE, WHEN THE EXECUTIVE RETIRED HE GOT $100 MILLION BUT THEY FROZE THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:54.194" end="00:04:55.395">PLAN FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.395" end="00:04:58.131">FINANCING THIS STUFF THOUGH IS WHAT REALLY SURPRISEDED ME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.131" end="00:05:02.703">THEY HAVE TAKEN OUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LIFE INSURANCE ON WORKERS AND THEY USE THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:02.703" end="00:05:06.106">LIFE INSURANCE AS EXECUTIVE PENSION FUNDS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.106" end="00:05:08.842">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO TOOK OUT LIFE INSURANCE ON THE WORKERS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.842" end="00:05:10.577">&gt;&gt; NESTLE, WAL-MART, DISNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.577" end="00:05:14.047">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE ALLOWED TO TAKE A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ON A WORKER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.047" end="00:05:16.650">DO THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ON THEM?</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.650" end="00:05:20.120">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THESE DAYS BUT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.120" end="00:05:23.690">&gt;&gt; Jon: CAN I JUST LIKE GO OUN THE STREET AND GO, THAT GUY IS OLD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.690" end="00:05:26.059">I&apos;M GOING TO TAKE OUT A POLICY ON HIM?</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.059" end="00:05:29.930">HOW CAN YOU HOLD A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ON SOMEONE WHO IS NOT IN YOUR FAMILY?</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.930" end="00:05:35.969">&gt;&gt; INITIALLY THEY WERE SAYING TO CONGRESS, WELL, IF WE LOSE A PART-TIME CLERK WHO HAS NO </p>
<p begin="00:05:35.969" end="00:05:39.973">BENEFITS IT&apos;S GOING TO COST US MONEY TO HAVE TO RETRAIN THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.973" end="00:05:41.208">CONGRESS SAID SURE DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.208" end="00:05:42.476">CONGRESS GOT TIRED OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.476" end="00:05:48.315">THEN THEY CONVINCED CONGRESS THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO TO PAY FOR RETIREEE BENEFITS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.315" end="00:05:51.218">THEY DIDN&apos;T SAY EXECUTIVE RETIREEE BENEFITS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.218" end="00:05:55.455">&gt;&gt; Jon: BY THEM BUYING LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES I&apos;M ONLY ASSUMING THAT IS PROFIT THAT </p>
<p begin="00:05:55.455" end="00:05:57.724">GOES INTO AN INSURANCE COMPANY AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.724" end="00:06:02.229">SO THEY&apos;VE CREATED A SORT OF A SELF SUSTAINING SYSTEM FOR THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.229" end="00:06:05.098">&gt;&gt; NO IT&apos;S LIKE A GIANT TAX SHELTER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.098" end="00:06:11.738">WHEN THE EMPLOYEES OR THE EX-EMPLOYEES OR THE RETIREES DIE, THE DEATH BENEFIT IS TAX </p>
<p begin="00:06:11.738" end="00:06:13.707">FREE TO THE COMPANY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.707" end="00:06:17.211">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHAT ALL THOSE CAKES AND PARTIES ARE AT CORPORATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.211" end="00:06:19.947">THEY ALWAYS SAY IT&apos;S FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY BUT CHANCES ARE...</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.947" end="00:06:21.782">(LAUGHING).</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.782" end="00:06:23.116">THIS IS IS REMARKABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.116" end="00:06:27.554">AGAIN IT&apos;S VERY EASY TO GET INTO THIS IDEA THAT ALL CORPORATIONS YOU CAN DEMONIZE </p>
<p begin="00:06:27.554" end="00:06:28.755">EVERYTHING THEY DO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.755" end="00:06:32.059">OBVIOUSLY THEY&apos;VE DONE A GREAT SERVICE AND AN ENGINE FOR THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.059" end="00:06:34.695">BUT THIS HAS GOTTEN WAY OUT OF HAND.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.695" end="00:06:38.065">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S... THEIR HANDS ARE IN EVERYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.065" end="00:06:42.769">VIRTUALLY EVERY RECOMMENDATION THAT COMPANIES MAKE TO IMPROVE RETIREMENT SECURITY </p>
<p begin="00:06:42.769" end="00:06:45.105">ESSENTIALLY HELPS IMPROVE THEIR BOTTOM LINE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.105" end="00:06:47.608">IT DOESN&apos;T IMPROVE ANYTHING FOR THE EMPLOYEE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.608" end="00:06:49.810">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE&apos;RE JUST TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE PENSIONS RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.810" end="00:06:51.311">THIS IS NOT THE PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.311" end="00:06:56.083">THIS IS NOT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE WAY THAT THESE OTHER CORPORATIONS CAN MANIPULATE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.083" end="00:07:02.756">TO BE FAIR TO THEM IF THE ECONOMY TANKS....</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.756" end="00:07:06.727">&gt;&gt; THE STOCK MARKET GOING DOWN,</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.727" end="00:07:13.867">BUT YOU STARTED OUT WITH IF YOU WERE LIKE VERIZON AND YOU STARTED OUT WITH 24 MILLION </p>
<p begin="00:07:13.867" end="00:07:17.638">SURPLUS YOU KNOW THAT STOCK MARKETS GO DOWN AND INTEREST RATES CAN FALL AND YOU KNOW </p>
<p begin="00:07:17.638" end="00:07:18.672">THAT PEOPLE GET OLDER.</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.672" end="00:07:28.615">&gt;&gt; Jon: I HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT MONEY OUT TO BUY PHONE CASES.</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.615" end="00:07:29.149">RETIREMENT HEIST.</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.149" end="00:07:30.918">IT&apos;S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.918" end="00:07:33.954">READ IT WITH A GLASS OF WINE.</p>
