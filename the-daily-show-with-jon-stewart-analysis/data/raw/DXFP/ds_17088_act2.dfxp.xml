<p begin="00:00:04.204" end="00:00:07.040">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.040" end="00:00:11.945">NOW, HILLARY ROSEN&apos;S COMMENTS ON WORKING MOTHERS WASN&apos;T THE ONLY NEWS LAST WEEK REGARDING </p>
<p begin="00:00:11.945" end="00:00:13.547">WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.547" end="00:00:14.815">LET&apos;S GO TO WISCONSIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.815" end="00:00:21.255">&gt;&gt; WISCONSIN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER QUIETLY SIGNED A BILL LAST NIGHT REPEALING THE STATE </p>
<p begin="00:00:21.255" end="00:00:23.457">EQUAL PAY LAW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.457" end="00:00:30.364">GLEN GROWTHMAN WHO PUSHD FOR EQUAL PAY REPEAL EXPLAINS YOU CAN ARGUE THAT MONEY IS MORE </p>
<p begin="00:00:30.364" end="00:00:31.131">IMPORTANT FOR MEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.131" end="00:00:40.040">I THINK A GUY IN THEIR FIRST JOB MAYBE BECAUSE THEY EXPECT TO BE A BREAD WINNER SOME DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.040" end="00:00:46.180">&gt;&gt; Jon: EVEN FOR A BILL MEANT TO SCREW WOMEN, THAT TAKES BALLS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.180" end="00:00:49.783">IT&apos;S JUST THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF CONSERVATIVE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS THAT SEEM </p>
<p begin="00:00:49.783" end="00:00:55.122">TO TO A MULTI-STATE ROLL BACK A NUMBER OF RIGHTS WOMEN HAVE COME TO ENJOY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.122" end="00:00:57.624">I WISH THERE WAS A PITTSBURGHIER WAY TO SAY THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.624" end="00:01:03.697">&gt;&gt; THE G.O.P. WAR ON WOMEN HAS EXPLODED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.697" end="00:01:04.731">&gt;&gt; Jon: CATCHY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.731" end="00:01:07.734">WAR ON WOMEN?</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.734" end="00:01:09.136">A PROBLEM WITH THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.136" end="00:01:10.804">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S NOT A WAR ON WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.804" end="00:01:12.739">&gt;&gt; THE RIDICULOUS OF THIS WAR ON WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.739" end="00:01:13.807">&gt;&gt; PHONY WAR ON WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.807" end="00:01:17.778">&gt;&gt; IT IS ONLY THE CYNICISM THAT PORTRAYS THAT AS A WAR ON WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.778" end="00:01:19.980">&gt;&gt; THIS IS A MADE UP PHONY WAR ON WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.980" end="00:01:22.382">&gt;&gt; Jon: RESPECT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.382" end="00:01:25.752">I THINK WHAT FOX IS TRYING TO SAY IS ELEVATING THIS POLITICAL FIGHT TO THE LEVEL </p>
<p begin="00:01:25.752" end="00:01:31.258">OF WAR NIN INS THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH REAL CONFLICTS ARE ENGAGED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.258" end="00:01:31.959">WAR IS REAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.959" end="00:01:33.460">WAR IS HELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.460" end="00:01:36.630">NOT SOME CASUAL METAPHOR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:38.232">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S A WAR ON CHRISTMAS IN AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.232" end="00:01:40.434">&gt;&gt; I DID NOT KNOW THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.434" end="00:01:43.871">I DID NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.871" end="00:01:47.140">CHRISTMAS SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.140" end="00:01:49.176">FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.176" end="00:01:54.114">IF FOX BELIEVES THE ATTACKS ON CHRISTMAS ARE SO SERIOUS AS TO WARRANT THIS LABEL THEY ARE </p>
<p begin="00:01:54.114" end="00:01:56.617">OTHERWISE LOATH TO USE, I&apos;M HAPPY TO HEAR THE REASONING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.617" end="00:01:59.620">&gt;&gt; A LOT OF COMPANIES HAVEN&apos;T BEEN SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.620" end="00:02:01.054">THEY&apos;VE BEEN GOING HAPPY HOLIDAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.054" end="00:02:05.459">&gt;&gt; CALLING THE STATE HOUSE CHRISTMAS TREE A HOLIDAY TREE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.459" end="00:02:07.294">&gt;&gt; A POSSIBLE TAX ON YOUR TREE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.294" end="00:02:10.631">&gt;&gt; THE TULSA HOLIDAY PARADE OF LIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.631" end="00:02:12.633">FORMALLY THE CHRISTMAS PARADE OF LIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.633" end="00:02:19.606">&gt;&gt; THE HOMEOWNERS STATION DOYLESTOWN BANNING COLORED AND BLINKING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.606" end="00:02:21.108">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO COLORED LIGHTS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.108" end="00:02:24.244">THIS IS WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.244" end="00:02:28.782">WHEN IT COMES TO CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AT DOYLESTOWN STATION,</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.782" end="00:02:31.451">IT&apos;S WHITES ONLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.451" end="00:02:36.790">ONLY THIS TIME LIBERALS WON&apos;T LIFT A FINGER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.790" end="00:02:40.494">THAT&apos;S A PRETTY STRONG CASE FOR A WAR ON CHRISTMAS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.494" end="00:02:45.465">YOU DO HAVE TO ASK THEN, SO WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE FOR SOME KIND OF WAR ON WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.465" end="00:02:50.103">&gt;&gt; ARIZONA&apos;S LEGISLATURE WOULD FORCE WOMEN TO PROVE TO EMPLOYERS THEY ARE USING BIRTH </p>
<p begin="00:02:50.103" end="00:02:51.171">CONTROL FOR MEDICAL REASONS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.171" end="00:02:55.309">&gt;&gt; IN MISSISSIPPI TODAY CRIMINALIZE ABORTION AT MURDER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.309" end="00:02:59.880">&gt;&gt; ARIZONA DOCTORS WILL NOT FACE A LAWSUIT IF THEY FAIL TO TELL PARENTS ABOUT ANY RISKS </p>
<p begin="00:02:59.880" end="00:03:01.048">THE UNBORN CHILD COULD FACE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.048" end="00:03:04.117">&gt;&gt; PENNSYLVANIA WOULD REQUIRE SONOGRAMS BEFORE ABORTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.117" end="00:03:08.655">&gt;&gt; THE TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND WHEN SEEKING AN ABORTION IN VIRGINIA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.655" end="00:03:10.224">&gt;&gt; THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.224" end="00:03:12.159">NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE&apos;S OPPOSITION TO THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:18.932">&gt;&gt; IN TEXAS A BILL THAT WOULD BLOCK PLANNED PARENTHOOD FROM RECEIVING STATE PLANNING MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.932" end="00:03:22.269">&gt;&gt; A BILL MAKING SINGLE PARENTING CHILD ABUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.269" end="00:03:30.344">&gt;&gt; IF YOU LIKE TO BEAT YOUR WIFE YOU SHOULD MOVE TO TOPEKA KANSAS BECAUSE IT&apos;S LEGAL THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.344" end="00:03:33.480">&gt;&gt; Reporter: OF COURSE IF YOU WATCH THE BEST BARBECUE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.480" end="00:03:35.649">KANSAS CITY IS WHERE IT&apos;S AT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.649" end="00:03:38.752">FOR WIFE BEATING YOU CAN HEAD TO TOPEKA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.752" end="00:03:45.092">WOW!</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.092" end="00:03:50.364">WITH ALL THOSE ATTEMPTS TO CURTAIL WOMEN&apos;S RIGHTS IN AREA AFTER AREA, ARE YOU TELLING ME </p>
<p begin="00:03:50.364" end="00:03:53.867">THAT THAT DOESN&apos;T RAISE THE LEVEL OF WAR?</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.867" end="00:03:56.403">THAT DOESN&apos;T BOTHER ANYONE AT FOX?</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.403" end="00:03:57.437">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.437" end="00:04:00.240">THIS GETS ME TO UPSET.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.240" end="00:04:04.745">I HAVE A FEELING I MIGHT HAVE TO LEAVE FOR THESE DISCUSSIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.745" end="00:04:07.047">&gt;&gt; Reporter: SHE WASN&apos;T TALKING ABOUT WOMEN&apos;S ISSUES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.047" end="00:04:08.682">WHAT WAS SHE TALKING ABOUT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.682" end="00:04:12.920">&gt;&gt; THERE APPARENTLY IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN STOCKTON CALIFORNIA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.920" end="00:04:18.525">THEY CAN&apos;T HAVE THINGS THAT REMIND PEOPLE OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON LIKE POINSETTIAS OR </p>
<p begin="00:04:18.525" end="00:04:22.930">SANTA IN THEIR CLASSES BECAUSE IT MIGHT OFFEND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CHRISTIAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.930" end="00:04:29.102">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, THAT IS UPSETTING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.102" end="00:04:36.410">WHAT CAN WOMEN DO TO GENERATE THE SAME SENSE OF OUTRAGE FROM FOX AS THE REMOVAL OF </p>
<p begin="00:04:36.410" end="00:04:42.382">DECORATIVE SLIGHTLY POLYGAMOUS HOLIDAY PLANS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.382" end="00:04:44.518">PERHAPS THEY COULD PLAY INTO THE THEME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.518" end="00:04:59.633">MAYBE WOMEN COULD PROTECT THEIR... REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS FROM UNWANTED MEDICAL INTRUSIONS WITH VAGINA MANGERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.633" end="00:05:08.775">I HAD NOT SEEN THAT PICTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.775" end="00:05:11.945">THAT REALLY COULD BE ANYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.945" end="00:05:17.050">IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE THE CROWN FROM THOSE IMPERIAL MARGARINE COMMERCIALS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.050" end="00:05:21.421">PERHAPS INSTEAD OF ASKING FOR BIRTH CONTROL, WOMEN COULD GET AN ADVENT CALENDAR WITH PILLS </p>
<p begin="00:05:21.421" end="00:05:23.891">INSTEAD OF CHOCOLATE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.891" end="00:05:27.194">THE 20th, PLACEBO DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.194" end="00:05:27.928">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.928" end="00:05:30.163">CHRISTMAS IS A SPECIAL CASE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.163" end="00:05:32.299">THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT HOLIDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.299" end="00:05:36.103">I&apos;M SURE THAT NOTHING ELSE RISES TO THAT LEVEL OF OUTRAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.103" end="00:05:37.771">&gt;&gt; WAR ON HANUKKAH NOW TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.771" end="00:05:38.972">&gt;&gt; A WAR ON EASTER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.972" end="00:05:41.108">&gt;&gt; A WAR ON... WAIT FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.108" end="00:05:41.775">ALL HOLIDAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.775" end="00:05:44.278">&gt;&gt; LET&apos;S TALK WAR ON HALLOWEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.278" end="00:05:45.746">&gt;&gt; WAR ON FOSSIL FUELS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.746" end="00:05:46.880">&gt;&gt; WAR ON THE CONSTITUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:49.416">&gt;&gt; THE WAR ON LADIES&apos; NIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.416" end="00:05:50.951">&gt;&gt; CAN YOU ACCEPT THE WAR ON SALT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.951" end="00:05:52.753">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S THE WAR ON CHOCOLATE MILK.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.753" end="00:05:54.755">&gt;&gt; WAR ON SUGARY DRINKS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.755" end="00:05:55.923">&gt;&gt; WAR ON FOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.923" end="00:06:02.796">&gt;&gt; IS THIS A NANNY STATE WAR ON SPUDS?</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.796" end="00:06:06.300">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, MY GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.300" end="00:06:09.770">NO WONDER WE&apos;RE HAVING TROUBLE IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.770" end="00:06:12.539">WE&apos;RE IN LIKE 18 WARS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.539" end="00:06:14.041">OH, MY GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.041" end="00:06:16.777">WE&apos;RE SPARTA.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.777" end="00:06:23.150">SEEMS LIKE WOMEN ARE THE ONLY THING THERE&apos;S NOT CURRENTLY A WAR ON.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.150" end="00:06:29.323">GOT TO BE SOME WAY TO EARN AMERICA&apos;S WOMEN COVETED WAR LABEL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.323" end="00:06:33.961">&gt;&gt; THE MEDIA WAGES A WAR ON CONSERVATIVE WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.961" end="00:06:41.468">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, SO FOR FOX IF WOMEN UPSET WITH RECENT REPUBLICAN LEGISLATIVE </p>
<p begin="00:06:41.468" end="00:06:45.272">RESTRICTIONS WANT TO BE CONSIDERED VICTIMS OF WAR THE SOLUTION IS EASY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.272" end="00:06:48.141">VOTE FOR THEM.</p>
