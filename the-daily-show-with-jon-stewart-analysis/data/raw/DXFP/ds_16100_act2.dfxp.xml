<p begin="00:00:05.205" end="00:00:11.478">SO THE FINANCIAL APOCALYPSE WAS AVERTED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.478" end="00:00:16.049">NO APOCALYPSE FINANCIALINGY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.049" end="00:00:20.254">WHAT ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL APOCALYPSE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.254" end="00:00:22.990">CAN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SAVE US?</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.990" end="00:00:24.091">NO.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.091" end="00:00:29.296">A *EUS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.296" end="00:00:35.102">&gt;&gt; WIND MAY FINALLY DO THE WORLD SOME GOOD AS A PROPOSED WIND FARM IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES </p>
<p begin="00:00:35.102" end="00:00:39.373">WILL DBREN RATE ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER 35,000 HOMES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.373" end="00:00:43.243">&gt;&gt; THE LAND WIND PROJECT IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.243" end="00:00:47.881">IT&apos;S GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AND IT&apos;S GOOD FOR THE ENERGY CONSUMER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.881" end="00:00:56.190">&gt;&gt; COULD YOU SAY THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A ROTE RESPONSE GIVEN TO YOU BY CORPORATE OVERLORDS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:01:00.060">&gt;&gt; SUGARLAND WIND IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.060" end="00:01:07.935">IT&apos;S GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY, AND IT&apos;S GOOD FOR THE ENERGY CONSUMER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.935" end="00:01:16.076">&gt;&gt; IT SOUNDS IDEAL BUT OF COURSE, THE TREE HUGGING HIPPY CONSERVATIONS HAVE A PROBLEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.076" end="00:01:21.715">&gt;&gt; THE LOCATION IS RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THREE LARGEST </p>
<p begin="00:01:21.715" end="00:01:23.550">CONCENTRATIONS OF DUCKS IN SOUTH FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.550" end="00:01:29.656">THESE TURBINES WILL KILL DUCKS AND IN THE FALL OF WINTER AND WE GET A TREMENDOUS MIGRATION OF DUCKS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.656" end="00:01:33.327">&gt;&gt; YOU ARE SAYING DUCKS MIGRATE TOLL FLORIDA AND THEN THEY&apos;LL DIE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.327" end="00:01:34.795">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.795" end="00:01:43.003">&gt;&gt; DUCKS WILL BE COMING TO FLORIDA TO DIE PUTTING THEM IN THE SAME RECAROUS POSITION AS -- </p>
<p begin="00:01:43.003" end="00:01:51.178">PRECARIOUS POSITION AS THE MANATEE AND THE NORTHERN -- NORTH AMERICAN GRANDPARENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.178" end="00:01:57.451">&gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO STOP KILLING THE BIRDS, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO HIM?</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.451" end="00:02:03.690">&gt;&gt; ISN&apos;T HE A PART OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT HUNTS DUCKS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.690" end="00:02:07.261">&gt;&gt; THE WATER FOULERS CONSERVATIONISTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.261" end="00:02:09.796">&gt;&gt; ISN&apos;T PART OF THEIR CHARTER TO HUNT DUCKS AS WELL?</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.796" end="00:02:12.065">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M CONFUSED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.065" end="00:02:14.801">WHAT DOES YOUR GROUP DO EXACTLY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.801" end="00:02:21.508">&gt;&gt; OUR MISSION IS TO MAKE DUCK HUNTING IN FLORIDA BETTER FOR FLORIDA DUCK HUNTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.508" end="00:02:25.512">&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT YOU WANT TO SAVE THE DUCKS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.512" end="00:02:28.415">&gt;&gt; WE WANT TO SAVE THE DUCKS SO WE CAN HUNT THE DUCKS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.415" end="00:02:34.321">&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO SAVE THE DUCKS NOW SO YOU CAN KILL THEM LATER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.321" end="00:02:37.925">&gt;&gt; WE PRESERVE THE WORD HARVEST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.925" end="00:02:38.725">&gt;&gt; OH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.725" end="00:02:43.764">ARE YOU WILLING TO ADMIT THAT YOUR WIND FARMS WILL BE HARVESTING THOUSANDS OF DUCKS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.764" end="00:02:45.566">&gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.566" end="00:02:48.969">&gt;&gt; NOT HARVESTING BUT JUST LIKE SLAUGHTER BEGUN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.969" end="00:02:53.941">&gt;&gt; BASED ON A NATIONAL AVERAGE OF WHAT WE&apos;RE SEEING ACROSS THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:53.941" end="00:03:04.852">UNITED STATES IS BASICALLY THREE BIRDS PERTURB YIEN FOR -- PER TUR TURBINE ARE KILLED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.852" end="00:03:10.757">&gt;&gt; IS THERE A NUMBER THAT IS SATISFACTORY TO YOU OF HOW MANY DUCKS ARE KILLED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.757" end="00:03:15.629">&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY NOBODY WANTS TO SEE ONE DUCK KILLED BY A WHIRLING TURBINE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.629" end="00:03:22.503">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE IT KWEULD A SHOT -- KILLED WITH A SHOTGUN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.503" end="00:03:23.170">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.170" end="00:03:25.772">&gt;&gt; YOU ARE LIKE THE SERIAL KILLER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.772" end="00:03:30.978">&gt;&gt; YOU ARE LIKE THE JAPANESE DOLPHIN HUNTER ANGRY AT THE TUNA NET.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.978" end="00:03:39.586">&gt;&gt; THAT IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE AGAIN THE DOLPHIN GETS INTO THE TUNA NET IS WASTED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.586" end="00:03:49.296">&gt;&gt; THE REAL VICTIMS ARE NOT DOLPHIN SIEWSH SUSHI LOVERS BUT DUCK HUNTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.296" end="00:03:50.564">MOST ARE AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.564" end="00:03:55.102">&gt;&gt; HOW WILL THIS PROJECT AFFECT YOUR LIFESTYLE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.102" end="00:03:58.272">&gt;&gt; IT WILL BE TERRIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.272" end="00:04:01.041">I CAN&apos;T KILL A DUCK THAT IS ALREADY DEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.041" end="00:04:03.677">&gt;&gt; THAT DOES SOUND TERRIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.677" end="00:04:09.483">&gt;&gt; (bleep) YOU NO GOOD TREACHEROUS MEXICAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.483" end="00:04:10.817">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M ACTUALLY INDIAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.817" end="00:04:12.219">&gt;&gt; (bleep).</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.219" end="00:04:12.686">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.686" end="00:04:21.628">&gt;&gt; AS THE DUCK HUNTERS HABITAT IS SLOWLY ENCROACHED UPON BY A MORE EFFICIENT DUCK KILLING </p>
<p begin="00:04:21.628" end="00:04:29.269">MACHINE, ONE THING IS CLEAR:  WOULD YOU SAY IN THIS INSTANCE THE HUNTER HAS BECOME THE HUNTED?</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.269" end="00:04:33.407">&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY THAT THE HUNTER WAS NOT CONSIDERED IN THIS PLAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.407" end="00:04:38.579">HUNTERS, NOT THE HUNTED, BECAUSE THE HUNTER WILL NOT BE HIT TO THE TURBINES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.579" end="00:04:45.085">&gt;&gt; I THINK IF YOU SAY THAT IT WOULD BRING A TEAR TO PEOPLE&apos;S EYES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.085" end="00:04:46.887">THE HUNTER HAS BEEN HUNTED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.887" end="00:04:49.423">&gt;&gt; SEMANTICALLY IT&apos;S NOT TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.423" end="00:04:53.894">&gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT THINGS TO CHANGE SAY THE HUNTER HAS BECOME THE HUNTED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.894" end="00:04:54.995">&gt;&gt; GREAT TV.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.995" end="00:04:56.096">I&apos;M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.096" end="00:04:57.931">&gt;&gt; WELL, SOMEONE HAS TO SAY IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.931" end="00:05:05.672">DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES THE HUNTER HAS BECOME THE HUNTED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.672" end="00:05:06.073">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.073" end="00:05:06.740">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK </p>
