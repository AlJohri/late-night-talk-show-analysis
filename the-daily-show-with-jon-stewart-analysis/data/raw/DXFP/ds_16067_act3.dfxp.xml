<p begin="00:00:27.794" end="00:00:31.865">THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.865" end="00:00:32.966">WE&apos;RE DELIGHTED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.966" end="00:00:34.768">LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY YOU ARE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.768" end="00:00:37.538">YOU ARE AN ACCREDITED HISTORIAN,</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.538" end="00:00:38.839">A CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.839" end="00:00:41.074">AM I CORRECT, SIR, IN SAYING THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.074" end="00:00:41.542">&gt;&gt; I HOPE SO.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.542" end="00:00:42.442">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.442" end="00:00:44.378">YOU&apos;VE WRITTEN HOW MANY BOOKS,</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.378" end="00:00:44.811">SEVEN?</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.811" end="00:00:45.746">&gt;&gt; SEVEN, YES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.746" end="00:00:47.414">&gt;&gt; Jon: SEVEN BOOKS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.414" end="00:00:50.417">I HAD THIS FELLOW ON THE PROGRAM A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.417" end="00:00:51.885">HIS NAME IS DAVID BARTON.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.885" end="00:00:54.154">HE CALLS HIMSELF A CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORIAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.154" end="00:00:57.024">HE HASmy AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.024" end="00:01:02.729">I THOUGHT, GEEZ, I&apos;M NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR AND HE TALKS REAL FUNNY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.729" end="00:01:14.608">WHY NOT BRING ON A GUY WHO ALSO TALKS FAST BUT InCONSTITUTION TO EXPLAIN </p>
<p begin="00:01:14.608" end="00:01:18.512">HEAD FELT LIKE THE LIBERTY BELL AFTER THIS GUY LEFT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.512" end="00:01:22.249">GIVE ME THE STATES RIGHTS SOUND BITE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.249" end="00:01:25.152">&gt;&gt; THE CONSTITUTION LIMITS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:25.152" end="00:01:26.954">STATES THAT&apos;S THE NINTH AND TENTH AMENDMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.954" end="00:01:32.125">FROM THE STANDPOINT OF FOUNDING FATHERS RELIGION WAS TO BE DEALT WITH IN STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.125" end="00:01:34.094">IT&apos;S THE POWERS DOCTRINE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.094" end="00:01:37.097">IF IT&apos;S NOT THERE THE CONGRESS DOESN&apos;T HAVE PERMISSION TO DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.097" end="00:01:41.268">THE BILL OF RIGHTS WAS ONLY TO LIMIT THE FEDERAL CONGRESS, NOT THE STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.268" end="00:01:49.576">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING IS IF THE STATES DO NOT WISH TO ABIDE BY THE BILL OF </p>
<p begin="00:01:49.576" end="00:01:51.912">RIGHTS, THEY DON&apos;T HAVE TO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.912" end="00:02:00.521">&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A LOT GOING IN THIS THAT STATEMENT INCLUDING A GREAT </p>
<p begin="00:02:00.521" end="00:02:05.425">DENIGRATION REALLY OF THE POWERS GRANTED TO THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION BY THE FOUNDING FATHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.425" end="00:02:15.202">BUT IT IS THE CASE THAT BETWEEN 1791 AND WHEN THE FEDERAL BILL OF RIGHTS WAS ADROPDROP THE -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:15.202" end="00:02:24.144">ADOPTED AND 1868 THE STATES WERE NOT OWE BLIJED -- OBLIGED TO ABIDE BY THE FEDERAL BILL OF RIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.144" end="00:02:28.916">THE FEDERAL BILL OF RIGHTS RELATED TO THOSE THINGS THAT CONGRESS COULD NOT DO TO ABRIDGE </p>
<p begin="00:02:28.916" end="00:02:30.684">FREEDOM OF RELIGION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.684" end="00:02:33.453">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE IS NOT A CRAZY PERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.453" end="00:02:34.721">&gt;&gt; HE IS NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.721" end="00:02:35.122">HE&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.122" end="00:02:35.889">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE&apos;S RIGHT!</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.889" end="00:02:38.592">&gt;&gt; ON THAT NARROW SUBJECT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.592" end="00:02:44.097">ON THE POINT OF RELIGION, IT&apos;S IMPORTANT TO THE NOTE THAT THE STATES N FACT, FOR NEARLY ALL OF </p>
<p begin="00:02:44.097" end="00:02:51.772">THAT PERIOD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THREE, CONNECTICUT UP TO 1818, NEW HAMPSHIRE UP TO 1819,</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.772" end="00:02:59.613">MASSACHUSETTS UP TO 1833, THOSE STATES ALSO ENACTED LAWS -- ALL OF THE OTHER STATES AND FINALLY </p>
<p begin="00:02:59.613" end="00:03:06.186">NEW HAMPSHIRE, CONNECTICUT AND MASSACHUSETTS EMBRACES THE IDEA NOT ONLY OF FREE EXERCISE OF </p>
<p begin="00:03:06.186" end="00:03:08.956">RELIGION BUT SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.956" end="00:03:09.823">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT SO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.823" end="00:03:12.693">&gt;&gt; THEY ULTIMATELY CAME IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BILL OF RIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.693" end="00:03:18.866">BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT AND REVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT CAME THREE-QUARTERS OF A CENTURY </p>
<p begin="00:03:18.866" end="00:03:23.871">LATER WHEN THE STATES AND THE CONGRESS ADOPTED THE 14th AMENDMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.871" end="00:03:36.416">JON, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FORGIVE ME I&apos;M A SAP MANTICS CONSTITUTIONAL -- SEMANTICS </p>
<p begin="00:03:36.416" end="00:03:37.351">CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.351" end="00:03:38.619">I WANT TO GET THE RIGHT WORDS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.619" end="00:03:39.520">&gt;&gt; Jon: PLEASE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.520" end="00:03:47.494">&gt;&gt; THIS IS MY TRUSTY CONSTITUTION -- POCKET CONSTITUTION FROM THE NATIONAL </p>
<p begin="00:03:47.494" end="00:03:48.095">CONSTITUTION CENTER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.095" end="00:03:51.098">&gt;&gt; Jon: FOR MADISON THAT WAS FULL SIZE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.098" end="00:03:51.832">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.832" end="00:03:56.103">YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.103" end="00:03:57.104">TINY LITTLE i.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.104" end="00:04:00.340">&gt;&gt; Jon: I BET THAT KILLED AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.340" end="00:04:00.841">GO AHEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.841" end="00:04:08.081">&gt;&gt; NO STATE SHALL MAKE OR ENFORCE ANY LAW WHICH SHALL ABRIDGE THE PRIVILEGES OR </p>

<p begin="00:04:21.061" end="00:04:28.402">WHAT THAT 14th AMENDMENT HAS COME TO MEAN AND THIS HAS BEEN EMBRACES BY VIRTUALLY EVERY </p>
<p begin="00:04:28.402" end="00:04:35.309">CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR IN THE COUNTRY AND EVERY JUDGE IN THE COUNTRY INCLUDING, ON MOST OH,S,</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.309" end="00:04:46.320">JUSTICE ANTONIC SCALIA -- ANTONIN SCALIA, WERE BOUND TO ABIDE BY THE FEDERAL BILL OF RIGHTS.u!</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:53.627">ALTHOUGH IT INITIALLY APPLIED TO ONLY ACTIONS OF CONGRESS IN OUR 21ST CENTURY WORLD IT TRULY DOES </p>
<p begin="00:04:53.627" end="00:04:56.763">APPLY PARTICULAR ANY IN THE AREA OF FIRST AMENDMENT TO STATES AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.763" end="00:05:02.369">&gt;&gt; Jon: I ASSUME HIS ARGUMENT?%?R WOULD BE THAT IS WRONGLY DECIDED AND THAT IS NOT THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:02.369" end="00:05:08.041">INTERPRETATION OF THE 14th AMENDMENT THAT THE FOUNDERS WOULD HAVE WANTED OTHERWISE THEY </p>
<p begin="00:05:08.041" end="00:05:10.043">WOULD HAVE PLACED IT IN THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.043" end="00:05:17.317">WHY DIDN&apos;T THE FOUNDERS PUT IN THE TENTH AMENDMENT THAT NOT JUST AT CONGRESS SHALL NOT </p>
<p begin="00:05:17.317" end="00:05:20.053">ABRIDGE THESE LAWS BUT THAT THE STATES SHALL NOT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.053" end="00:05:24.224">&gt;&gt; IN FACT, JAMES MADISON WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN DRAFTING THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:24.224" end="00:05:30.130">FEDERAL BILL OF RIGHTS WANTED AN ARTICLE PROHIBITING THE STATES FROM INFRINGING FREEDOM OF </p>
<p begin="00:05:30.130" end="00:05:33.767">RELIGION AND ESTABLISHING RELIGION BUT HE WAS DEFEATED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.767" end="00:05:38.872">HE WAS DEFEATED BECAUSE MASSACHUSETTS, CONNECTICUT AND NEW HAMPSHIRE DIDN&apos;T WANT THAT </p>

<p begin="00:05:40.541" end="00:05:44.878">BUT, IN FACT, THE TIDE OF HISTORY WAS MOVING WITH MADISON.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.878" end="00:05:47.114">THOSE STATES DID ULTIMATELY DO THAT ON THEIR OWN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.114" end="00:05:53.187">&gt;&gt; Jon: IN SOME RESPECTS THERE&apos;S A GOOD KERNEL OF HISTORY HERE THAT IS HOLDING ON IT TO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.187" end="00:05:59.893">IT&apos;S NOT COMPLETELY AL CAMI BUT IT&apos;S IGNORING THE 200 YEARS AFTER IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.893" end="00:06:04.798">SORT OF LIKE MAKING THE ARGUMENT WE HAD SHR SLAVES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.798" end="00:06:09.636">IN THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION WE HAD SLAVES SO THE FOUNDERS WOULD BE OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.636" end="00:06:11.071">&gt;&gt; PRECISELY.</p>
