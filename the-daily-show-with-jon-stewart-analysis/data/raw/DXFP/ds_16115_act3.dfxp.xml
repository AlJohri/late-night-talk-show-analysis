<p begin="00:00:50.817" end="00:00:51.752">MAKE THEM COUNT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.752" end="00:00:55.022">YOU HAVE MODERATED HOW MANY PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES?</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.022" end="00:00:56.356">&gt;&gt; 11.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.356" end="00:00:57.691">&gt;&gt; Jon: INCREDIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.691" end="00:01:02.196">WILL YOU... HAVE YOU SEEN IT SINCE WHEN YOU STARTED WHAT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST CHANGE THAT </p>
<p begin="00:01:02.196" end="00:01:05.899">YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE EVOLUTION OF THESE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.899" end="00:01:09.203">&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE&apos;S SOME FORMAT CHANGES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.203" end="00:01:13.574">WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED YOU&apos;D HAVE A MODERATOR AND YOU&apos;D HAVE </p>
<p begin="00:01:13.574" end="00:01:19.813">THREE JOURNALIST PANELS AND NOW IT&apos;S DOWN... WE&apos;VE GONE THROUGH SEVERAL TRANSFORMATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.813" end="00:01:24.117">NOW WE&apos;RE DOWN TO BASICALLY A SOLE MODERATOR FORMAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.117" end="00:01:28.121">ONE PERSON WITH ALL THE DINE MATE IN ONE PERSON&apos;S HANDS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.121" end="00:01:28.689">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.689" end="00:01:31.225">AND NOW THEY DO THESE YOUTUBE DEBATES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.225" end="00:01:34.528">PRETTY SOON THEY&apos;LL JUST TAKE TWITTER QUESTIONS, NOBODY WILL EVEN BE THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.528" end="00:01:34.895">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:34.895" end="00:01:35.796">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE EXACTLY RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.796" end="00:01:43.570">THE OTHER BIG CHANGE WAS THE COMING OF THE &quot;TOWN HALL&quot; PUTTING PEOPLE IN AN AUDIENCE </p>
<p begin="00:01:43.570" end="00:01:46.974">AND A LOT OF... CHOSEN PEOPLE AND SOME OF THEM ARE NOT...</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.974" end="00:01:49.142">&gt;&gt; Jon: JUST JEWS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.142" end="00:01:57.117">(LAUGHTER) THE CHOSEN PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.117" end="00:01:59.419">&gt;&gt; A DIFFERENT CHOOSER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.419" end="00:02:01.488">AND A DIFFERENT CHOOSER FOR EVERY DEBATE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.488" end="00:02:04.491">LIKE THE ONE YOU&apos;VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT, THAT WAS...</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.491" end="00:02:08.829">THOSE... THAT AUDIENCE WAS DRAWN FROM THE TEA PARTY MEMBERSHIP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.829" end="00:02:09.329">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.329" end="00:02:16.403">&gt;&gt; LIKE THE ONE BEFORE THAT NBC DID AT SIMI VALLEY, IT WAS THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.403" end="00:02:21.408">REAGAN LIBRARY AND WAS CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT PART OF THE WORD AND WHO IN THAT PART </p>
<p begin="00:02:21.408" end="00:02:22.743">OF THE WORLD POLITICALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.743" end="00:02:23.243">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.243" end="00:02:29.082">&gt;&gt; BUT THE NATIONALLY TELEVISED PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE RUN BY THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:29.082" end="00:02:30.584">COMMISSION AND THEY ARE...</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.584" end="00:02:31.518">THERE&apos;S STRICT RULES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.518" end="00:02:34.321">THERE&apos;S NO HOLLERING, NO SHOUTING, NONE OF THIS STUFF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.321" end="00:02:34.788">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.788" end="00:02:37.958">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT&apos;S ALL DONE FOR THE AUDIENCE, IT&apos;S NOT DONE... I </p>
<p begin="00:02:37.958" end="00:02:40.827">MEAN FOR THE TELEVISION AUDIENCE, NOT FOR THE FOLKS THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.827" end="00:02:42.129">THEY&apos;RE NOT RALLIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.129" end="00:02:46.667">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT ARE THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE AMONGST THE CANDIDATES CAMPS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.667" end="00:02:51.438">BECAUSE OFF STORY ABOUT HOW YOU GUYS... YOU WERE HAVING A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, YOU DECIDED </p>
<p begin="00:02:51.438" end="00:02:55.008">ON THE FORMAT AND PETER JENNINGS SAID &quot;I&apos;VE GOTTEN A IDEA, LET&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:02:55.008" end="00:02:59.112">THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND AND MAKE THESE GUYS TALK TO EACH OTHER&quot; AND EVERYBODY WAS LIKE </p>
<p begin="00:02:59.112" end="00:03:01.682">&quot;WE CAN&apos;T DO THAT!&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:01.682" end="00:03:09.623">&gt;&gt; WELL, MY... I HAD A VERY SELF-RIGHTEOUS VIEW OF THAT AND I TALKED PETER JENNINGS OUT OF </p>
<p begin="00:03:09.623" end="00:03:11.291">THAT ON THE GROUNDS THAT, LOOK,</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.291" end="00:03:20.834">WE AGREED TO MODERATE UNDER THESE RULES AND I&apos;VE GOTTEN A OBLIGATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.834" end="00:03:25.272">AND IF FOR SOME REASON THE CANDIDATES AND DEBATE COMMISSION AGREE LET&apos;S HAVE A DEBATE WHERE </p>
<p begin="00:03:25.272" end="00:03:26.907">THERE ARE NO RULES, THAT&apos;S FINE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.907" end="00:03:29.176">AND WE&apos;D DONE THAT A COUPLE TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.176" end="00:03:34.448">I DID ONE IN &apos;92 WITH GEORGE H.W. BUSH, BILL CLINTON AND ROSS PEROT FOR 45 MINUTES, ONE HALF </p>
<p begin="00:03:34.448" end="00:03:43.090">OF A 90-MINUTE DEBATE WHERE IT WAS JUST ME AND THOSE THREE CANDIDATES WITH VERY FEW RULES,</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.090" end="00:03:44.625">NO ONE MINUTE, TWO MINUTE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.625" end="00:03:44.992">WHATEVER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.992" end="00:03:45.659">THAT WAS SCARY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.659" end="00:03:50.097">REALLY SCARY AND TU BUT EXHILARATING AND IT DID WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.097" end="00:03:55.669">UNFORTUNATELY, IT WORKED WELL BUT IT&apos;S NEVER BEEN TRIED AGAIN BECAUSE THE CANDIDATES AND THEIR </p>
<p begin="00:03:55.669" end="00:03:57.304">HANDLERS ARE AFRAID...</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.304" end="00:04:00.541">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.541" end="00:04:01.808">THEY DON&apos;T WANT TO TAKE A RISK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.808" end="00:04:05.212">&gt;&gt; Jon: IN RETROSPECT, A LOT OF THE PARTICIPANTS TALK ABOUT </p>
<p begin="00:04:05.212" end="00:04:08.048">THE DEBATES, WHILE THEY DIDN&apos;T LIKE THEM AND WHILE THEY HAD TO </p>
<p begin="00:04:08.048" end="00:04:13.053">MANAGE THEM, THEY FELT MADE THEM EITHER STRONGER CANDIDATES OR IN PRESIDENT CLINTON&apos;S CASE A </p>
<p begin="00:04:13.053" end="00:04:15.756">STRONGER PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.756" end="00:04:19.826">THEY FELT IT WAS AN EXERCISE IN THINKING ABOUT SCENARIOS YOU WOULDN&apos;T NORMALLY THINK ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.826" end="00:04:20.794">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.794" end="00:04:28.068">CLINTON FELT THAT VERY STRONGLY BECAUSE IT FORCED HIM... HE SAYS IT FORCES ALL THE CANDIDATES,</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.068" end="00:04:32.306">OKAY, WHAT IS MY POSITION ON SOCIAL SECURITY OR ON WHETHER OR NOT... WHAT...</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.306" end="00:04:33.407">&gt;&gt; Jon: I LOVE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.407" end="00:04:34.208">I LOVE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.208" end="00:04:40.080">THEY&apos;VE GOT A HANDLER AND THEY&apos;RE LIKE &quot;YES, TELL ME, WHAT IS MY POSITION ONS IS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:44.785">BECAUSE WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT IN MY HEAD I SOUND INCOHERENT.&quot; (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:04:44.785" end="00:04:46.086">&gt;&gt; WELL, BUT SEE WHAT HAPPENS,</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.086" end="00:04:50.891">THEY SAY, OKAY, WELL, NOW WE&apos;VE HEARD YOU SAY WHAT YOUR POSITION IS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.891" end="00:04:53.894">YOU CAN&apos;T SAY THAT BECAUSE THAT&apos;S THE THIRD RAIL POSITION </p>
<p begin="00:04:53.894" end="00:04:57.264">AND THEY&apos;LL TALK ABOUT THAT AND THAT&apos;S ALL THEY&apos;LL TALK ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.264" end="00:04:58.699">SO ROUND IT A LITTLE BIT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.699" end="00:05:00.267">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S CHANGED A LOT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.267" end="00:05:02.870">THE FIRST ONE YOU DEAL WITH NIXON/KENNEDY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.870" end="00:05:06.640">AND THE REAL TAKEAWAY FROM NIXON/KENNEDY IS TELEVISION IS THE GAME CHANGER BECAUSE YOU </p>
<p begin="00:05:06.640" end="00:05:13.380">WRITE IN THERE NIXON HAD COME FROM THE HOSPITAL, DIDN&apos;T WANT ANY MAKEUP KENNEDY HAD A </p>
<p begin="00:05:13.380" end="00:05:16.216">DISEASE, ADDISON&apos;S DISEASE BUT THAT MADE HIM LOOK MORE TAN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.216" end="00:05:19.052">SO HE GOES OUT THERE AND IF YOU WATCH IT ON TELEVISION THEY&apos;RE </p>
<p begin="00:05:19.052" end="00:05:23.123">LIKE &quot;OH, I LIKE THE CUT OF HIS JIB.&quot; IF YOU LISTEN TO IT ON RADIO </p>
<p begin="00:05:23.123" end="00:05:25.859">YOU&apos;RE LIKE &quot;THAT GUY GOT CREAMED.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:25.859" end="00:05:26.326">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.326" end="00:05:33.433">IT CHANGED EVERYTHING AND, IN FACT, NIXON HIMSELF SAID IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY I SPENT TOO MUCH </p>
<p begin="00:05:33.433" end="00:05:38.405">TIME WORRYING ABOUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY AND NOT WHAT I LOOKED LIKE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.405" end="00:05:43.510">AND I SAID IN THE BOOK AND I REALLY BELIEVE THIS THAT CANDIDATES WHO DON&apos;T PAY </p>
<p begin="00:05:43.510" end="00:05:47.247">ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE OR WHAT THEY... THEIR BODY LANGUAGE AS WELL AS THEIR SPOKEN </p>
<p begin="00:05:47.247" end="00:05:52.519">LANGUAGE ARE MAKING A TERRIBLE MISTAKE BECAUSE PEOPLE WATCH THESE DEBATES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.519" end="00:05:57.624">REMEMBER THESE NATIONALLY TELEVISED DEBATES AT THE END ARE USUALLY IN LATE SEPTEMBER, EARLY OCTOBER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.624" end="00:06:01.929">90% OR MORE OF THE FOLKS HAVE PRETTY MUCH MADE UP THEIR MIND FOR WHOM THEY&apos;RE GOING TO VOTE </p>
<p begin="00:06:01.929" end="00:06:08.068">OR ARE LEANING AND SO WHAT EVERYBODY&apos;S DOING IS TAKING THE MEASURE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS </p>
<p begin="00:06:08.068" end="00:06:11.572">TO... CAN I SEE THIS PERSON SITTING BEHIND THE DESK IN THE OVAL OFFICE?</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.572" end="00:06:15.542">HOW WOULD HE OR SHE REACT IF THERE WAS ANOTHER KATRINA AND ALL OF THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.542" end="00:06:16.643">DO I LIKE THIS PERSON?</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.643" end="00:06:19.580">AND YOU SEE THEM RIGHTING TO AND IT&apos;S MORE ABOUT THAT...</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.580" end="00:06:21.682">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S JUST SUCH A...</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.682" end="00:06:28.255">TELEVISION MAKES IT SUCH A FRIGHTENING PROPOSITION BECAUSE YOU REALLY DO IMAGINE THROUGHOUT </p>
<p begin="00:06:28.255" end="00:06:29.656">HISTORY LOSING GREAT LEADERS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.656" end="00:06:36.663">PEOPLE ON TELEVISION GOING &quot;YEAH, LINCOLN, NICE BEARD, NOT VOTING FOR HIM.&quot; (LAUGHTER) </p>
