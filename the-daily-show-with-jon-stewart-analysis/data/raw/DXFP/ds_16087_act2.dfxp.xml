<p begin="00:00:05.239" end="00:00:06.273">&gt;&gt; Jon: THERE ARE SOME WARS,</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.273" end="00:00:15.182">THERE ARE SOME WARS SO GRISLY AND HEARTBREAKING THAT NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.182" end="00:00:18.085">&gt;&gt; BIRDS ALL OVER AMERICA ARE DYING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.085" end="00:00:19.553">BAFFLING SCIENTISTS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.553" end="00:00:29.363">BUT NOW GEORGE EP FENWAY OF THE AMERICAN BIRD CONSERVANCY THINKS THE REASON COULD BE IN OUR OWN BACKYARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.363" end="00:00:30.063">&gt;&gt; CATS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.063" end="00:00:30.731">&gt;&gt; CATS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.731" end="00:00:35.235">&gt;&gt; YES, CATS KILL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BIRDS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.235" end="00:00:40.073">&gt;&gt; IS THIS WHY BIRDS ARE SO ANGRY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.073" end="00:00:41.909">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:00:41.909" end="00:00:47.581">&gt;&gt; I THINK ACTUALLY THE MAJORITY OF BIRDS ARE ACTUALLY MORE FEARFUL OF CATS BECAUSE CATS ARE </p>
<p begin="00:00:47.581" end="00:00:53.320">SUPERPRIDD TERS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO BIRDS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.320" end="00:00:55.155">&gt;&gt; SO I REACHED OUT TO THE CATS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.155" end="00:01:04.097">BUT THEY WOULD ONLY SPEAK TO ME THROUGH THEIR MONEYED LOBBYIST.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.097" end="00:01:04.965">&gt;&gt; CATS ARE PART.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.965" end="00:01:06.567">ECOSYSTEM AND THEY ARE NOT THE REAL THREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.567" end="00:01:11.371">THERE IS POLLUTION, THERE&apos;S URBAN SPRAWL, THERE&apos;S DEVELOPMENT, AND THERE ARE </p>
<p begin="00:01:11.371" end="00:01:13.207">OTHER BIRDS THAT KILL BIRDS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.207" end="00:01:16.176">&gt;&gt; SO THERE&apos;S BIRD ON BIRD VIOLENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.176" end="00:01:16.977">&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.977" end="00:01:21.315">&gt;&gt; THERE IS SOME BIRD ON BIRD VIOLENCE, HAWKS KILL BIRDS, THINGS LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.315" end="00:01:22.382">BUT THAT&apos;S NATURAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.382" end="00:01:26.353">THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF BIRDS HAVE EVOLVED OVER A </p>
<p begin="00:01:26.353" end="00:01:30.224">MILLENNIA WHERE CATS ARE NOT NATIVE TO THE UNITED STATES SO CATS ARE LIKE IMMIGRANTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.224" end="00:01:32.092">CATS ARE DEFINITELY IMMIGRANTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.092" end="00:01:36.730">&gt;&gt; IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO LIE AROUND AND TAKE HANDOUTS WHEN THEY ARE </p>
<p begin="00:01:36.730" end="00:01:40.467">NOT COMMITTING CRIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.467" end="00:01:44.104">&gt;&gt; THEY MADE THEIR HOME HERE AND THAT&apos;S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.104" end="00:01:47.908">&gt;&gt; IF YOU OWN A CAT, KEEP IT INDOORS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.908" end="00:01:51.211">UNOWNED CATS NEED TO BE CAPTURED AND REMOVED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.211" end="00:01:54.114">&gt;&gt; THEY WERE STIRRING ARGUMENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.114" end="00:01:56.250">BUT ONE THING STILL TROUBLED ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:01:58.118">&gt;&gt; WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT BIRDS AGAIN?</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.118" end="00:02:00.521">&gt;&gt; WE CARE ABOUT BIRDS BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE GOOD FOR US.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.521" end="00:02:04.491">&gt;&gt; DO WE REALLY NEED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MORE BIRDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.491" end="00:02:05.759">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:07.261">&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO NEW YORK CITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.261" end="00:02:11.798">THAT PLACE IS COVERED IN BIRD [BLEEP].</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.798" end="00:02:17.604">&gt;&gt; BUT FOR PEOPLE LIKE LALA WILDS WHO LOVES CATS AND BIRD APPROXIMATES, THIS </p>
<p begin="00:02:17.604" end="00:02:20.140">INTRACTABLE WAR HAS BEEN DEVASTATING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.140" end="00:02:27.181">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IF I HAD TO MAKE A SOPHIE&apos;S CHOICE OF CATS OR BIRDS, I AM GOING TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:27.181" end="00:02:28.549">HAVE TO TAKE CATS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.549" end="00:02:29.650">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW SOPHIE&apos;S CHOICE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.650" end="00:02:35.589">I THINK ORIGINALLY THAT&apos;S WHAT IT WAS ABOUT, TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A CAT AND A BIRD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.589" end="00:02:37.491">&gt;&gt; FORTUNATELY IT DOESN&apos;T HAVE TO COME TO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.491" end="00:02:43.697">THERE WAS HELP IN THE FORM OF ANIMAL PLANET&apos;S CAT WHISPERER JACKSON GAL AXY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.697" end="00:02:47.601">&gt;&gt; WE COULD START DIRECTING THAT IMPULSE TOWARDS MORE APPROPRIATE VICTIMS, YOU </p>
<p begin="00:02:47.601" end="00:02:49.703">KNOW, LIKE TOYS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.703" end="00:02:50.103">&gt;&gt; OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.103" end="00:02:54.441">&gt;&gt; NOW WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF TOYS, RIGHT THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD CALL AN INTERACTIVE TOY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.441" end="00:02:55.542">LOOK AT THAT, SEE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.542" end="00:02:57.311">&gt;&gt; WAIT, JUST STOP FOR A SECOND.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.311" end="00:02:59.379">YOU CARRY AROUND A GUITAR CASE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.379" end="00:03:01.849">&gt;&gt; YEAH, I DO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.849" end="00:03:04.251">&gt;&gt; EVEN ARE YOU EMBARRASSED ABOUT BEING A CAT WHISPERER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.251" end="00:03:07.254">YOU JUST WANT PEOPLE TO THINK ARE YOU IN A -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.254" end="00:03:13.727">&gt;&gt; BUT LALA&apos;S CAT DIDN&apos;T GET THE MESSAGE AND CONTINUED TO DEFIANTLY HUNT BIRDS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.727" end="00:03:20.601">&gt;&gt; SINCE NO OUTSIDE MEDIATOR COULD BRING PEACE, THERE WAS ONE LAST OPTION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.601" end="00:03:23.537">&gt;&gt; CAT WHITION PERER THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO END THIS CONFLICT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.537" end="00:03:24.905">THEY HAVE TO TALK IT OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.905" end="00:03:27.307">CAT, BIRD, YOU HAVE TO TALK THIS OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.307" end="00:03:44.291">WE&apos;LL BE BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.291" end="00:03:46.994">&gt;&gt; OH, COME ON, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.994" end="00:03:48.695">THE BIRD DIDN&apos;T EVEN WANT TO MAKE A DEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.695" end="00:03:50.531">HE JUST TAKES OFF, JUST FLEW A WHAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.531" end="00:03:51.932">WHY DIDN&apos;T YOU STAY WITH HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.932" end="00:03:53.233">&gt;&gt; IT WASN&apos;T A TALKING THING -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:53.233" end="00:03:54.735">&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.735" end="00:03:56.103">WHY DID HE TAKE OFF?</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.103" end="00:03:59.306">&gt;&gt; AND SO SADLY THE WAR RAGES ON </p>
