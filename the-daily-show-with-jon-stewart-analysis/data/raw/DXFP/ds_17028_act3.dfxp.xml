<p begin="00:01:31.525" end="00:01:34.328">THAT WAS THE CRAZIEST THING I SAW ON TELEVISION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.328" end="00:01:36.763">THE QUESTION WAS, AND HIS LAWYER WAS SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.763" end="00:01:40.501">HOW DID HIS LAWYER ALLOW HIS CLIENT TO BE ON THE PHONE WITH YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.501" end="00:01:42.102">&gt;&gt; HE ACTUALLY OFFERED HIS CLIENT.</p>

<p begin="00:01:46.440" end="00:01:49.710">&gt;&gt; AND LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE WE WERE TO SIT DOWN HE SAID WHAT IF WE WERE </p>
<p begin="00:01:49.710" end="00:01:53.480">TO GUESS SANDUSKY ON THE PHONE AND I&apos;M THINKING PERHAPS THAT ISN&apos;T THE BEST </p>

<p begin="00:01:56.917" end="00:02:00.254">BUT YES, YES, WE&apos;LL DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.254" end="00:02:05.158">&gt;&gt; Jon: DE EVER, LIKE AS HE WAS LEAVING DE LEAN IN AND GO OH, BY THE WAY, I&apos;M A </p>
<p begin="00:02:05.158" end="00:02:06.059">TERRIBLE LAWYER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.059" end="00:02:10.097">(LAUGHTER) DID HE SAY ANY OF THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.097" end="00:02:12.132">&gt;&gt; NO, NO, HE DIDN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.132" end="00:02:16.203">&gt;&gt; Jon: I THOUGHT THAT WAS MAYBE THE MOST N THIS DAY AND AGE OF WELL PRACTICED </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.203" end="00:02:20.707">PUBLIC RELATIONS AND EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO MOUNT THEIR DEFENSE AND DRESS UP </p>
<p begin="00:02:20.707" end="00:02:25.746">AND PRESENT-- THAT WAS THE MOST REVEALING INTERVIEW IN ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS I </p>
<p begin="00:02:25.746" end="00:02:26.780">THINK HI EVER SEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.780" end="00:02:31.852">&gt;&gt; AND IT WAS-- IT WAS SO STRIPPED OF ALL THE ART FIS OF TELEVISION, YOU KNOW IT </p>
<p begin="00:02:31.852" end="00:02:37.291">WAS JUST A DISEMBODIED VOICE WHICH MADE IT ALL THE STRANGER, AND NO B ROLL AS </p>
<p begin="00:02:37.291" end="00:02:42.095">THEY CALL T NO FOOTAGE REALLY OF HIM, AN OCCASIONAL STILL PICTURE BUT MOSTLY IT </p>
<p begin="00:02:42.095" end="00:02:45.199">WAS ME LOOKING INTO THE CAMERA INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT HIM AND HIM ANSWERING THESE </p>
<p begin="00:02:45.199" end="00:02:48.335">QUESTIONS IN HIS OWN WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.335" end="00:02:49.203">&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.203" end="00:02:51.471">I MEAN I FELT ONE OF THE MOST REVEALING QUESTIONS,</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.471" end="00:02:57.444">YOU SAID TO HIM, ARE YOU SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO UNDERAGED BOYS AND HE DOES THAT THING THAT PEOPLE DO </p>
<p begin="00:02:57.444" end="00:02:59.112">WHEN THEY ARE GUILTY, HE GOES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.112" end="00:03:00.848">&gt;&gt; AM I SEXUALLY ATTRACT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.848" end="00:03:02.349">LIKE HE REPEATS THE QUESTION,</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.349" end="00:03:03.917">LIKE DID YOU BREAK THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.917" end="00:03:07.054">&gt;&gt; DID I BREAK THAT VASE WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.054" end="00:03:12.159">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE REPEATS IT AND THEN HE GIVES SOME WEIRD LIKE WELL, I LIKE THEIR ENERGY AND -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:16.563">&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE SAID I ENJOY BEING AROUND YOUNG PEOPLE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.563" end="00:03:21.668">ET CETERA, ET CETERA, AND THEN EVENTUALLY HE GOT TO BUT AM I SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO THEM, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.668" end="00:03:23.370">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT, BUT WHEN YOU SAID -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:26.106">&gt;&gt; IT TOOK 17 SECONDS BEFORE THE WORD NO CAME OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.106" end="00:03:28.509">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN YOU SAID ARE YOU A PEDOPHILE WHAT HE DID SAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.509" end="00:03:30.611">&gt;&gt; HE IMMEDIATELY SAID NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.611" end="00:03:36.450">&gt;&gt; Jon: I WONDER IF IN HIS DELUDED, POISONED HEAD HE&apos;S LIKE OH, NO, I&apos;M NOT A </p>
<p begin="00:03:36.450" end="00:03:40.888">PEDOPHILE, LIKE DOES HE-- HE THINKS THERE&apos;S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A PEDOPHILE </p>
<p begin="00:03:40.888" end="00:03:42.256">AND BEING ATTRACTED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.256" end="00:03:46.727">&gt;&gt; OR PERHAPS HE THINKS, AND I&apos;M RELUCTANT TO GET INTO THIS AREA OF SPECULATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.727" end="00:03:48.795">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHY BY AM DOING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.795" end="00:03:49.129">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.129" end="00:03:51.832">&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE YOU A RESPONSIBLE JOURNALIST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.832" end="00:03:54.201">SO IN THAT CASE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.201" end="00:03:56.236">&gt;&gt; CONTINUE, JON, BECAUSE I&apos;M FASCINATED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.236" end="00:03:57.971">&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.971" end="00:04:02.109">HE&apos;S-- I&apos;M TELLING YOU THOUGH, AND NOW THIS OTHER GUY, IN SIR KURX I KNOW THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:02.109" end="00:04:07.247">EASY THING TO DO IS THEY ARE IDENTICAL SITUATIONSESES, I KNOW THEY ARE NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.247" end="00:04:09.550">YOU ARE A SYRACUSE GUY, YOU GOT THIS OTHER GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.550" end="00:04:14.855">I MEAN IS THIS, IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS AN EPIDEMIC WITHIN THESE INFRASTRUCTURES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.855" end="00:04:16.757">AND I HATE TO FEEL THAT WAY,</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.757" end="00:04:20.427">AND I HATE TO BE PARANOID ABOUT IT BUT WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH?</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.427" end="00:04:25.933">&gt;&gt; SO FAR, AND I UNDERLINE SO FAR THERE IS NO EVIDENCE CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT </p>
<p begin="00:04:25.933" end="00:04:30.971">THERE WAS SOME SORT OF INSTITUTIONAL COVER-UP AT SYRACUSE THE WAY THERE OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.971" end="00:04:35.209">WE DON&apos;T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT AT PENN STATE BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS AN </p>
<p begin="00:04:35.209" end="00:04:36.643">INSTITUTIONAL COVER-UP AT PENN STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.643" end="00:04:40.714">YOU WONDER WHY THE SYRACUSE POST STANDARD DIDN&apos;T PURSUE IT MORE THAN THEY DID.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.714" end="00:04:47.955">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY HAD THIS TAPE OF THE ACCUSER AND THE ACCUSED WIFE IN 2002.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.955" end="00:04:49.323">NOBODY DID ANYTHING WITH IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.323" end="00:04:49.690">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.690" end="00:04:52.726">THEY SAID THEY COULDN&apos;T CORROBORATE IT AT THAT POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.726" end="00:04:55.829">AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE, I DON&apos;T KNOW WHERE IT GOES BUT IT RAISES A </p>
<p begin="00:04:55.829" end="00:05:01.635">QUESTION, DENNIS DUVAL WHO PLAYED BASKETBALL IN SYRACUSE WHEN I WAS A STUDENT TLRBS, VERY GOOD,</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.635" end="00:05:04.705">PLAYED BRIEFLY IN THE NBA,</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.705" end="00:05:06.073">BAHEM WAS AN ASSISTANT COACH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.073" end="00:05:12.279">FOR A LONG TIME DENNIS WAS THE SHERIFF OF ONONDAGA COUNTY AND WHEN THIS WAS FIRST PRESENTED TO THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:12.279" end="00:05:16.283">AUTHORITIES THERE, I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT IF NIP INFLUENCE DENNIS HAD BUT IT IS A </p>
<p begin="00:05:16.283" end="00:05:16.950">QUESTION WORTH ASKING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.950" end="00:05:20.254">THEY DIDN&apos;T PURSUE IT AT LEAST THEY DIDN&apos;T PURSUE IT AGGRESSIVELY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.254" end="00:05:26.293">AND ESPN HAD THE TAPE FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND THEY SAT ON THE STORY UNTIL PERHAPS </p>
<p begin="00:05:26.293" end="00:05:29.062">COINCIDENTALLY JUST AFTER THE PENN STATE THING BROKE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.062" end="00:05:29.763">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S CRAZY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.763" end="00:05:31.398">AND YOU DO WONDER, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.398" end="00:05:34.134">YOU FEEL LIKE, YOU FEEL WHEN YOU FIRST MOVE TO NEW YORK,</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.134" end="00:05:36.170">LIKE I JUST IS A A COCKROACH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.170" end="00:05:41.074">AND I KNOW THERE&apos;S THOUSANDS OF THOSE MOTHER [BLEEP] DOWN THERE, AND THAT IS THE THING </p>
<p begin="00:05:41.074" end="00:05:42.609">THAT YOU WORRY ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.609" end="00:05:46.113">LIKE WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS COMES TO LIRKTS YOU WONDER, LIKE DO WE HAVE TO </p>
<p begin="00:05:46.113" end="00:05:49.583">NOW IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOCIETY HAS CHANGED AND YOU CAN&apos;T LET YOUR KID PLAY </p>
<p begin="00:05:49.583" end="00:05:54.254">OUTSIDE ANY MORE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, FORGET ABOUT LIKE OHIO STATE PLAYERS GETTING A </p>
<p begin="00:05:54.254" end="00:05:56.089">TATTOO FOR A JERSEY, LIKE THIS IS REAL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.089" end="00:05:56.390">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.390" end="00:06:01.228">IF ANYTHING GOOD IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THESE TWO SITUATIONS, WHICH ARE NOT </p>
<p begin="00:06:01.228" end="00:06:05.332">EXACTLY THE SAME, THEY ARE GREATER DISSIMILARITIES AT THE MOMENT THAN SIMILARITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.332" end="00:06:07.434">BUT IF ANYTHING GOOD IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS,</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.434" end="00:06:11.438">THERE IS GOING TO BE AN AWARENESS OF IF YOU SEE SOMETHING OR IF YOU HAVE </p>
<p begin="00:06:11.438" end="00:06:16.043">REASON TO SUSPECT SOMETHING THAT INVOLVES CHILDREN BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF, IT&apos;S NOT </p>
<p begin="00:06:16.043" end="00:06:19.046">ENOUGH TO, CERTAINLY NOT TO TURNT OTHER WAY AND CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO SAY </p>
<p begin="00:06:19.046" end="00:06:21.715">WELL, I PASSED IT ON TO MY IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.715" end="00:06:23.517">YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.517" end="00:06:25.319">AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO HAVE PROCEDURES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.319" end="00:06:28.922">AND I THINK WILL YOU FIND MORE AND MORE THEY WILL DO BACKGROUND CHECKS THEY ARE </p>
<p begin="00:06:28.922" end="00:06:31.325">DO BACKGROUND CHECKS ON KOCHES, ASSISTANT COACH,</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.325" end="00:06:33.060">ANYONE WHO WORKS WITH THESE KIDS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.060" end="00:06:33.694">&gt;&gt; Jon: GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.694" end="00:06:36.263">NICE JOB.</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.263" end="00:06:40.501">BY THE WAY, 100 YARDS OF GLORY.</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.445" end="00:06:53.847">JOE GARNER HAS NO CHANCE OF BEING ON THIS SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.847" end="00:06:54.248">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.248" end="00:06:59.086">AS A MATTER OF FACT, IF I AM BEING-- WE&apos;LL PROBABLY EDIT HIS NAME OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.086" end="00:07:04.124">BUT THIS IS TO HIS ADVANTAGE BECAUSE WILL GET LOTS OF MONEY IF YOU BUY THIS BOOK.</p>
