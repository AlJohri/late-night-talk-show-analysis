<p begin="00:01:33.093" end="00:01:34.228">WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.</p>

<p begin="00:01:37.164" end="00:01:39.766">TELL THE TRUTH SO TAVER THEY HANG UP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.766" end="00:01:41.835">&gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT SAY-- .</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.835" end="00:01:42.703">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT REALLY TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.703" end="00:01:43.637">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.637" end="00:01:47.441">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT TYPICAL BEHAVIOUR FOR A CRISIS MANAGEMENT, IS A HAND, JUST </p>
<p begin="00:01:47.441" end="00:01:54.848">TELL THE TRUTH, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE FROM OUR EXPERIENCE IN THESE SITUATIONS, THE TRUTH IS THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:54.848" end="00:02:00.687">THING THEY&apos;RE TRYING TO BURY IN A HOLE UNDERNEATH, YOU KNOW, A ROOT CELL AR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.687" end="00:02:05.425">&gt;&gt; RIGHT, WELL LOOK, MY BRAND OF CRIES SIS PROBABLY DIFFERENT FROM MOST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.425" end="00:02:07.094">I AM OLD SCHOOL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.094" end="00:02:09.062">AND I THINK THAT YOU HAVE GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.062" end="00:02:17.704">BECAUSE LOOK, EVERYBODY IS-- YOUR PARENTS SAY IT GOING TO COME OUT ANYWAY SO </p>
<p begin="00:02:17.704" end="00:02:19.072">WHAT IS THE POINT IN HIDING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.072" end="00:02:20.874">THE OTHER THING I THINK IS REALLY KEY IS THAT LOOK,</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.874" end="00:02:23.544">WHEN PEOPLE SCREW UP, WE ALL DO AND I THINK THAT WHEN WE APOLOGISE AND WE ARE SINCERE </p>
<p begin="00:02:23.544" end="00:02:26.213">ABOUT IT, THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO GIVE YOU A SECOND CHANCE BUT YOU REALLY CAN&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:02:26.213" end="00:02:28.148">BS ABOUT IT, YOU JUST HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.148" end="00:02:30.551">SO IT&apos;S SIMPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.551" end="00:02:36.223">&gt;&gt; Jon: HAS ANYONE EVER TAKEN THAT ADVICE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.223" end="00:02:38.192">( <span tts:fontStyle="italic">LAUGHTER</span> ) BECAUSE I&apos;M THINKING NOW TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:38.192" end="00:02:42.863">ALL THE SCANDALS AND I AM WONDERING, SO YOUR ADVICE IS TELL THE TRUTH AND THEN </p>
<p begin="00:02:42.863" end="00:02:44.631">APOLOGIZE IN A SINCERE FASHION AND I&apos;M LIKE, YEAH,</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.631" end="00:02:46.133">I DON&apos;T REMEMBER THAT HAPPENING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.133" end="00:02:47.734">I-- SO YOU HAVE NEVER WORKED WITH ANYONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.734" end="00:02:56.343">&gt;&gt; NO, LOOK, THERE IS A LOT OF STEPS IN BETWEEN THAT, IN TELLING THE TRUTH AND APOLOGY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.343" end="00:03:00.180">YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE FACTS AND SOMETIMES YOU AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE AS SU HAVE </p>
<p begin="00:03:00.180" end="00:03:02.549">ALL SEEN THE FACTS GET CLOUDED SOMETIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.549" end="00:03:06.286">IT&apos;S NOT FACTS OF HOW WE WANT THEM TO BE BUT HOW THEY TRULY ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.286" end="00:03:07.454">AND HOW THEY REALLY ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.454" end="00:03:08.655">AND SOMETIMES IT TAKE ACE WHILE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.655" end="00:03:15.262">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO DOW WORK WITH THEM IN TERMS OF COMING TO AN ACCEPTANCE OF THE BAD </p>
<p begin="00:03:15.262" end="00:03:17.397">PLACE THAT THEY ARE IN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.397" end="00:03:18.665">SO THAT THEY CAN GIVE AN HONEST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.665" end="00:03:23.370">OR DO YOU WORK WITH THEM IN HERE&apos;S HOW WE CAN, BECAUSE I ALWAYS IMAGINE CRISIS </p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:27.941">MANAGER DOES THIS, HERE IS HOW WE CAN MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU ARE FEELING BAD </p>
<p begin="00:03:27.941" end="00:03:34.915">ABOUT THIS, YOU KNOW, THAT IT&apos;S MORE ABOUT FIXING THE IMAGE OF IT THAN THE SOUL OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.915" end="00:03:41.922">&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK YOU HAVE TO DO BOTH I MEAN YOU CAN&apos;T COME OUT </p>
<p begin="00:03:41.922" end="00:03:42.890">AND APOLOGISE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.890" end="00:03:44.391">AND NOT MEAN IT BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS SMART.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.391" end="00:03:46.793">THEY&apos;RE NOT GOING TO BUY IT YOU&apos;VE SEEN SOME EXAMPLES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.793" end="00:03:50.797">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M SORRY, I DIDN&apos;T GET THAT LAST PART.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.797" end="00:03:53.300">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE TO THE GOING TO BUY IT YOU SEE A LAT OF -- DASH LOT OF TIMES WHEN </p>
<p begin="00:03:53.300" end="00:03:57.638">PEOPLE COME OUT AND THEY HAVE DONE SOMETHING AND PERHAPS THE WIFE IS STANDING </p>
<p begin="00:03:57.638" end="00:04:01.942">BESIDE THEM AND ARE YOU ALL SAYING OH, YEAH, OKAY, THEY REALLY FORGIVE THAT PERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.942" end="00:04:03.043">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS,</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.043" end="00:04:07.481">HAVE WE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO BE IN A CRISIS MANAGEMENT </p>
<p begin="00:04:07.481" end="00:04:09.516">SITUATION WHEN PERHAPS THEY SHOULDN&apos;T?</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.516" end="00:04:16.757">HAVE WE FORCED THESE PUBLIC FIGURES INTO THESE OPEN CONFESSIONS ON TELEVISION </p>
<p begin="00:04:16.757" end="00:04:23.730">WHEN, IN FACT, IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY ALL RIGHT TO DEMAND IT OR ACCEPT IT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.730" end="00:04:24.731">&gt;&gt; YEAH, I THINK TWO THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.731" end="00:04:26.700">I THINK LOOK AT THE PUBLIC FIGURE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.700" end="00:04:30.771">YOU HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF EXPECTATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.771" end="00:04:33.874">AND I THINK THE PUBLIC DEMANDS THAT, YES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.874" end="00:04:36.076">BUT I ALSO THINK THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE IS A LINE THAT HAS TO BE DRAWN WHETHER </p>
<p begin="00:04:36.076" end="00:04:45.452">YOU ARE A PUBLIC FIGURE OR NOT YOU STILL HAVE SOME PRIVACY-- AND I THINK YOU SHOULD MAINTAIN THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.452" end="00:04:47.087">EVERYTHING IS NOT EVERYBODY&apos;S BUSINESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.087" end="00:04:48.589">&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU&apos;RE IN A CRISIS SITUATION AND YOU&apos;RE DEALING </p>
<p begin="00:04:48.589" end="00:04:52.559">WITH THE MEDIA STORM AND THE VORACIOUS PACK AND SOMEONE WHO MAYBE IS MORALS, WITHOUT </p>
<p begin="00:04:52.559" end="00:04:58.165">DOW HAVE A HARDER TIME EMPATHIZING WITH IN DO YOU EVER JUST THINK ABOUT IT </p>
<p begin="00:04:58.165" end="00:05:02.503">LIKE OH, LOOK, THE WOLFS ARE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.503" end="00:05:04.438">AND SO SOMEBODY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THROW TO THEM?</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.438" end="00:05:08.609">HOW DO YOU-- HOW DO YOU JUDGE THOSE TWO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.609" end="00:05:12.646">&gt;&gt; YEAH, LOOK, WITH THE MEDIA WHEN ARE YOU IN A CRISIS IT&apos;S GOING TO BE THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.646" end="00:05:15.415">IT&apos;S THE NATURE OF THE BEAST.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.415" end="00:05:19.520">AND WHAT WE REALLY TRY TO DO AS WE&apos;RE NAVIGATING THE CRISIS IS TO BALANCE THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:23.957">NEED OF THE CLIENT, ALSO YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.957" end="00:05:27.427">AND IN THAT WHOLE PROCESS YOU HAVE TO TRY TO PROTECT THE REPUTATION AND THE BRAND.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.427" end="00:05:31.064">IT&apos;S LIKE A CHESS GAME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.064" end="00:05:34.968">&gt;&gt; Jon: I JUST RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT BRIAN WILLIAMS OF NBC IS A NEWS ANCHOR,</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.968" end="00:05:37.070">PUNCHED A GIRL SCOUT IN A WHEELCHAIR.</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.511" end="00:05:45.245">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.245" end="00:05:46.346">AND EVERYBODY-- .</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.346" end="00:05:47.581">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THAT IS COMING OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.581" end="00:05:52.920">I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY UNPROVOKED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.920" end="00:05:54.321">I THINK HE DID THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.321" end="00:05:57.791">WHERE&apos;S MY [BLEEP] THIN MINTS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.791" end="00:05:59.092">&gt;&gt; SO BRIAN NOW IS GOING TO CALL ME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.092" end="00:06:03.630">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO BRIAN NOW BECAUSE HE HAS DONE THIS TERRIBLE THING AND </p>
<p begin="00:06:03.630" end="00:06:05.799">IT IS ON CELL PHONE FOOTAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.799" end="00:06:12.072">&gt;&gt; BRIAN, I WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU HAVE DONE THAT TERRIBLE THING, LOOK AT ME NOW, BRIAN,</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.072" end="00:06:15.609">IF YOU HAVE DONE THAT TERRIBLE THING, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.609" end="00:06:19.847">THAT YOU SOMEHOW LOST YOUR MIND, PERHAPS BECAUSE THE RATINGS WEREN&apos;T EXACTLY AS </p>
<p begin="00:06:19.847" end="00:06:20.814">THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.814" end="00:06:21.515">&gt;&gt; Jon: GO TO REHAB,</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.515" end="00:06:22.249">WILLIAMS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.249" end="00:06:23.584">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.584" end="00:06:27.154">&gt;&gt; Jon: GO TO REHAB!</p>
