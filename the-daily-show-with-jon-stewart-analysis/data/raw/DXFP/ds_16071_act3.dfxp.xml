<p begin="00:04:13.420" end="00:04:17.090">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT BRINGS UP AN ISSUE BECAUSE I&apos;M WATCHING THIS OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY </p>
<p begin="00:04:17.090" end="00:04:18.192">FOOTBALL SCANDAL GO DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.192" end="00:04:20.060">THESE PLAYERS,.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.060" end="00:04:25.332">&gt;&gt; OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY AS OPPOSED TO JUST OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, THESE GUYS THEY </p>
<p begin="00:04:25.332" end="00:04:28.735">DON&apos;T MAKE ANY MONEY, THEY DO GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO THE SCHOOL BUT THEY TRADED SOME </p>
<p begin="00:04:28.735" end="00:04:30.771">OF THEIR SWAG FOR TATTOOS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.771" end="00:04:34.174">NOW IT SEEMS UNFAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.174" end="00:04:35.509">&gt;&gt; THEY FROM GOOD TATTOOS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.509" end="00:04:38.946">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT SHOULD SAY I GAVE ME SHIRT AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY TATTOO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.946" end="00:04:40.314">BUT IT SEEMS AN UNFAIR THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.314" end="00:04:43.083">THEY BRING IN SO MANY MILLIONS FOR THESE UNIVERSITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.083" end="00:04:46.353">YET THEY AREN&apos;T-- DOES THAT SEEM RIGHT IN YOUR EYES?</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.353" end="00:04:49.223">&gt;&gt; WELL, IT&apos;S A TOUGH SITUATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.223" end="00:04:52.993">I CAN LOOK ON BOTH SIDES, ON THE NCAA SIDE AND SEE HOW HARD IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.993" end="00:04:56.663">THEY HAVE TO MANAGE SO MANY ATHLETES AND MAKE SURE THAT NONE ARE DOING ANYTHING </p>
<p begin="00:04:56.663" end="00:04:59.867">ILLEGAL BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE HAVING A LOT OF ATHLETES THAT WORK EXTREMELY </p>
<p begin="00:04:59.867" end="00:05:02.469">HARD AND MAKE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS FOR UNIVERSITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.469" end="00:05:04.171">AND THEY&apos;RE STILL, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.171" end="00:05:07.541">STRUGGLING JUST TO GO OUT TO OUTBACK TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.541" end="00:05:08.942">SO I CAN SEE ON BOTH SIDES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.942" end="00:05:12.946">I THINK YOU KNOW SOMETHING FAIR WOULD BE IF SOME OF THE ATHLETES GOT A LITTLE BIT </p>
<p begin="00:05:12.946" end="00:05:17.618">MORE SO THEY COULD GO TO DINNER, AFFORD A SCOOT TORE DRIVE AROUND CAMPUS, LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.618" end="00:05:19.152">NOT TO GET PAID.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.152" end="00:05:20.320">&gt;&gt; Jon: REALLY, A SCOOTER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:25.058">&gt;&gt; A SCOOTER, I MEAN AT COLLEGE, IT WOULD HELP SO MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.058" end="00:05:30.797">&gt;&gt; Jon: I THEY WANT TO GO TO OUTBACK AND A SCOOTER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.797" end="00:05:32.132">THAT&apos;S GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.132" end="00:05:33.834">&gt;&gt; BUT IT&apos;S A GREAT STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.834" end="00:05:37.237">I WISH DENVER BRONCOS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE LOOKING THIS YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.237" end="00:05:39.640">&gt;&gt; HOPEFULLY PRETTY GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.640" end="00:05:42.442">&gt;&gt; Jon: LISTEN, ELWAY IS NOW THE GM THAT HAS TO BE GOOD FOR YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.442" end="00:05:43.377">&gt;&gt; YES, HE IS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.377" end="00:05:44.444">&gt;&gt; Jon: AS A QUARTERBACK.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.444" end="00:05:46.146">&gt;&gt; PRETTY GOOD GUY TO LEARN FROM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.146" end="00:05:46.680">&gt;&gt; Jon: ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.680" end="00:05:47.848">I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.</p>
