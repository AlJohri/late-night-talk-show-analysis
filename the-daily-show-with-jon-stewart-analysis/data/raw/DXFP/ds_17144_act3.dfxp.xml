<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:27.287">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.287" end="00:01:30.557">&gt;&gt; AND GOVERNOR ROMNEY HAS A DIFFERENT STYLE AND A DIFFERENT PERSONALITY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.557" end="00:01:30.958">HOWEVER...</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.958" end="00:01:38.098">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, THOUGH, IF I&apos;M HEARING YOU CORRECTLY, IS THAT HE HAS A PERSONALITY.</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.708" end="00:01:54.882">BUT SOME PEOPLE TEND TO EITHER VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY SUPPRESS IT.</p>

<p begin="00:02:04.925" end="00:02:09.830">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT... HOW IS... LET ME... YESTERDAY WAS A DAY FOR THE REPUBLICANS OF DIVERSITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.830" end="00:02:12.533">AND IT REALLY WAS AN IMPRESSIVE LINEUP.</p>

<p begin="00:02:28.315" end="00:02:30.884">I&apos;M SURE I SCREWED UP THAT NAME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.884" end="00:02:34.988">YET POLLS ARE STILL SHOWING THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR MITT ROMNEY IS 0%.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.988" end="00:02:37.491">(LAUGHTER) THAT&apos;S POLL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.491" end="00:02:41.595">YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE THE MARGIN OF ERROR.</p>

<p begin="00:02:44.731" end="00:02:49.503">AGAIN, IS THIS... IS THIS AN ISSUE OF STYLE AND PERSONALITY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.503" end="00:02:53.807">OR IS THERE... DO THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A PROBLEM ON THEIR HANDS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.807" end="00:02:55.642">&gt;&gt; TWO THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.642" end="00:03:03.350">FIRST, I AM NOT A 0 AND I KNOW A LOT OF OTHER AMERICAN BLACK CONSERVATIVES THAT ARE GONNA </p>

<p begin="00:03:04.117" end="00:03:12.092">BUT SECONDLY, THE POLLS ARE INACCURATE IN MINUTE BASED UPON ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE, BASED UPON </p>
<p begin="00:03:12.092" end="00:03:13.760">PEOPLE THAT I KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:14.394">HERE&apos;S WHY...</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.394" end="00:03:20.467">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW, DOES THAT USUALLY JUST... FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT&apos;S WHY THEY DO POLLS.</p>

<p begin="00:03:27.941" end="00:03:31.278">&gt;&gt; NOW, HERE&apos;S WHY IN THAT PARTICULAR POLL...</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.278" end="00:03:31.778">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.778" end="00:03:36.350">&gt;&gt; THEY MAY HAVE HAD ZERO BLACKS, MINORITIES GONNA VOTE...</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.350" end="00:03:40.821">BLACK SPECIFICALLY WERE GONNA VOTE FOR GOVERNOR ROMNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.821" end="00:03:42.389">THEY WERE WORKING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.389" end="00:03:46.360">SO THEY DIDN&apos;T ANSWER THE PHONE WHEN THEY TOOK THE POLLS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.360" end="00:03:49.963">(AUDIENCE REACTS) BELIEVE IT OR NOT, SOME BLACK PEOPLE HAVE JOBS!</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.831" end="00:03:51.932">&gt;&gt; AND CAREERS!</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.932" end="00:03:54.835">AND THEY RUN BUSINESSES!</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.835" end="00:03:56.703">THEY DIDN&apos;T TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.703" end="00:04:02.843">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU&apos;RE SUGGESTING THAT THE POLL WAS DONE PURELY FOR UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE?</p>

<p begin="00:04:03.443" end="00:04:10.517">&gt;&gt; NO!</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.517" end="00:04:11.919">&gt;&gt; Jon: HERE&apos;S THE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.919" end="00:04:13.453">YOU ALREADY ANSWERED MY QUESTION!</p>
