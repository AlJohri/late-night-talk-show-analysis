<p begin="00:00:16.383" end="00:00:18.519">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM BEN LOWY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.519" end="00:00:33.867">( APPLAUSE ) SO THIS IS A SELECTION OF OR A COLLECTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS FROM IRAQ FROM THE YEARS....</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.867" end="00:00:35.736">&gt;&gt; 2003 TO 2008.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.736" end="00:00:41.108">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU GO TO IRAQ TO COLLECT THESE PHOTOGRAPHS THROUGH THOSE YEARS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.108" end="00:00:42.442">&gt;&gt; WAY TOO MANY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.442" end="00:00:44.211">MORE THAN MY WIFE WOULD HAVE LIKED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.211" end="00:00:46.313">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT MANY TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.313" end="00:00:48.215">LET ME TELL YOU HOW THIS HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.215" end="00:00:50.083">SO WE DID THIS ROLLING STONE PIECE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.083" end="00:00:52.719">THEY SAID, OH, WE&apos;RE GOING TO SEND OVER THIS PHOTOGRAPHER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.719" end="00:00:56.557">HE&apos;S JUST GOING TO HANG OUT WITH YOU GUYS FOR A DAY AND TAKE SOME PICTURES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.557" end="00:00:59.059">WE THOUGHT, OKAY, WE&apos;LL ROUGH HIM UP A LITTLE BIT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.059" end="00:01:00.360">THIS GUY SHOWS UP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.360" end="00:01:01.762">WHERE WERE YOU BEFORE THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.762" end="00:01:02.462">WHERE WAS IT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.462" end="00:01:03.063">&gt;&gt; LIBYA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.063" end="00:01:06.099">&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.099" end="00:01:06.834">&gt;&gt; I GET AROUND.</p>

<p begin="00:01:15.943" end="00:01:20.113">THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACES IN THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.113" end="00:01:21.348">&gt;&gt; THOSE AND OTHER PLACES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.348" end="00:01:24.985">I MEAN I&apos;VE DONE MY SHARE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.985" end="00:01:29.456">I&apos;VE DONE THE SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIM SUIT SHOOT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.456" end="00:01:32.960">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID YOU TAKE ANY SHRAPNEL THERE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:36.330">&gt;&gt; IT WASN&apos;T NECESSARILY SHRAPNEL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.330" end="00:01:40.534">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY TELL ME IT&apos;S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO STAND SOMETIMES IN THE POOLS OF </p>
<p begin="00:01:40.534" end="00:01:43.303">WATER ARE NOT AS WARM AS YOU WOULD THINK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.303" end="00:01:47.474">&gt;&gt; IT CAN BE TOUGH WITH THE LIGHT AND THE SUNTAN LOTION,</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.474" end="00:01:47.774">YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.774" end="00:01:48.709">&gt;&gt; Jon: I UNDERSTAND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.709" end="00:01:51.278">TELL ME WHAT... I JUST WANT TO SHOW SOME OF THESE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.278" end="00:01:52.779">THE SELECTION OF PICTURES...</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.779" end="00:01:55.883">THESE ARE ALL THROUGH HUMVEE WINDOWS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.883" end="00:01:57.651">CAN YOU CUT TO THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.651" end="00:01:58.452">DO WE HAVE ONE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.452" end="00:02:00.621">IT&apos;S THROUGH A HUMVEE WINDOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.621" end="00:02:04.124">THE ORANGE POST-IT IS NOT ACTUALLY PART OF THE BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.124" end="00:02:06.293">&gt;&gt; I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.293" end="00:02:08.128">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT CENTRAL PARK IN BAGHDAD?</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.128" end="00:02:08.896">WHAT IS THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.896" end="00:02:16.537">&gt;&gt; THAT IS ACTUALLY A RESIDENCY BUILDING FOR LIKE THE BASICALLY THE MINISTRY OF </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.537" end="00:02:21.475">PRISONS AND INTERIOR WHERE LAWYERS AND INVESTIGATORS LIVE BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST </p>
<p begin="00:02:21.475" end="00:02:26.246">IMAGES I MADE WHEN I THOUGHT OF THIS IDEA OF PHOTOGRAPHING IRAQ THROUGH HUMVEE WINDOWS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.246" end="00:02:34.321">BUT IT&apos;S AMAZING THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND IRAQ AT THE TIME IT&apos;S ALL WIRE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.321" end="00:02:36.690">ALL THIS FREEDOM WE SAY WE BROUGHT TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.690" end="00:02:42.596">AT THE SAME TIME THE PEOPLE PASSED A LAW IN THEIR COUNTRY TO HIDE BEHIND THESE GLASS WALLS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.596" end="00:02:43.430">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.430" end="00:02:48.335">WERE THE IRAQIS RESENTFUL OF THE BLAST WALLS AND THOSE THAT WERE AROUND THEM?</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.335" end="00:02:52.806">&gt;&gt; NOT THE GUY WHO HAS THE CONTRACT TO MAKE THE BLAST WALLS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.806" end="00:02:55.876">ACTUALLY DIRECTLY BEHIND THAT... I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT OF THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:55.876" end="00:02:57.277">CAR AND GO TO THE OTHER SIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.277" end="00:03:00.914">RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BLAST WALLS WAS LIKE A SWING SET.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.914" end="00:03:04.218">WHERE LIKE, YOU KNOW, KIDS WERE PLAYING BECAUSE PEOPLE LIVE THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.218" end="00:03:06.420">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU WERE TELLING ME...</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.420" end="00:03:12.392">WHEN I WENT TO AFGHANISTAN, I WENT SURROUNDED BY MILITARY PERSONNEL WITH GUNS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.392" end="00:03:13.827">I WAS WEARING A FLAK JACKET.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.827" end="00:03:18.131">I ASKED YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO AFGHANISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.131" end="00:03:19.199">HOW ARE YOU GETTING THERE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.199" end="00:03:20.567">IT WAS LIKE I&apos;M WALKING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.567" end="00:03:22.336">LIKE IT WAS SOME CRAZY....</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.336" end="00:03:24.104">&gt;&gt; AFGHANISTAN IS A DIFFERENT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.104" end="00:03:25.439">SORT OF A DIFFERENT BALLGAME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.439" end="00:03:30.444">AFTER SO MANY YEARS IN IRAQ EMBEDDING WITH U.S. SOLDIERS THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT I&apos;VE </p>
<p begin="00:03:30.444" end="00:03:33.080">WORKED IN AFGHANISTAN I&apos;VE NEVER BEEN WITH U.S. SOLDIERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.080" end="00:03:34.915">I JUST KIND OF GO ON MY OWN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.915" end="00:03:39.553">IT&apos;S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE TO SEE IT FROM THE OTHER SIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.553" end="00:03:44.391">I WOULD SAY IN AFGHANISTAN IT&apos;S A LOT EASIER TO WORK ON THE STREET OR WITH AFGHANS </p>
<p begin="00:03:44.391" end="00:03:47.694">WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF NATO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.694" end="00:03:51.698">&gt;&gt; Jon: REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.698" end="00:03:54.935">&gt;&gt; I GREW UP IN NEW YORK IN THE &apos;80s.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.935" end="00:03:56.904">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S NOT THE SAME THING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.904" end="00:03:58.939">I LIVED HERE IN THE &apos;0s.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.939" end="00:04:05.846">HAVING A GUY TRY TO SELL YOU SOMETHING BY THE PARK IS NOT THE SAME AS BEING IN AFGHANISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.846" end="00:04:06.313">LOOK AT THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.313" end="00:04:09.183">THIS IS ANOTHER PICTURE FROM IRAQ THAT I WANTED TO SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.183" end="00:04:10.484">I DON&apos;T KNOW IF YOU CAN GET THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.484" end="00:04:15.189">IT&apos;S A WOMAN... THE THING I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING HERE IS NOT THE EGGS BUT RIGHT NOW TO HER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.189" end="00:04:15.956">THAT WHITE BLOCK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.956" end="00:04:16.623">WHAT IS THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.623" end="00:04:19.226">&gt;&gt; THAT IS ICE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.226" end="00:04:20.627">IT WAS SORT OF AMAZING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.627" end="00:04:22.729">I ENDED UP RESEARCHING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.729" end="00:04:25.465">THERE ISN&apos;T A LOT OF ELECTRICITY IN IRAQ.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.465" end="00:04:27.968">SOME IN BAGHDAD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.968" end="00:04:31.905">MAYBE FOUR HOURS A DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.905" end="00:04:33.073">PEOPLE DON&apos;T HAVE FREEZERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.073" end="00:04:35.609">YOU HAVE TO GO BUY YOUR ICE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.609" end="00:04:36.476">FROM A STORE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.476" end="00:04:40.981">THERE ARE ACTUALLY FACTORIES FOR MAKING ICE THAT PEOPLE GO GET A SLICE OF.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.981" end="00:04:44.351">IT&apos;S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE NOT USED TO IN THE WEST THAT WE DON&apos;T UNDERSTAND.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.351" end="00:04:46.186">IT WAS REALLY REVEALING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.186" end="00:04:50.557">&gt;&gt; Jon: I PUSH A CUP INTO MY REFRIGERATOR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.557" end="00:04:55.629">WHEN THAT DOESN&apos;T WORK, I CURSE THE HEAVENS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.629" end="00:04:57.831">DID YOU SEE IMPROVEMENT DURING YOUR TIME THERE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.831" end="00:04:59.533">DID YOU SEE THINGS CHANGE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.533" end="00:05:01.134">&gt;&gt; DEFINITELY THINGS CHANGED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.134" end="00:05:05.239">I MEAN, THE 2004 TO 2007 WAS HELLISH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.239" end="00:05:09.243">BUT THEN IN 2008 THINGS, YOU KNOW, WERE STARTING TO GET BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.243" end="00:05:10.143">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU KEPT GOING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.143" end="00:05:11.111">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.111" end="00:05:13.213">&gt;&gt; Jon: BECAUSE YOU&apos;RE NUTS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.213" end="00:05:14.915">WE TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.915" end="00:05:16.049">&gt;&gt; THAT I&apos;M NUTS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.049" end="00:05:16.783">&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.783" end="00:05:18.051">&gt;&gt; MY WIFE THINKS SO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.051" end="00:05:19.953">&gt;&gt; Jon: LOOK AT THIS ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.953" end="00:05:22.289">THIS IS THROUGH THE NIGHT VISION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.289" end="00:05:27.327">THAT&apos;S A GENTLEMAN WHO I BELIEVE IS JUST SAYING, OH, MY GOSH, I DIDN&apos;T KNOW YOU WERE </p>
<p begin="00:05:27.327" end="00:05:28.629">GOING TO TAKE MY PICTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.629" end="00:05:30.197">I WOULD HAVE SHOWERED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.197" end="00:05:38.572">&gt;&gt; WELL, I WAS WITH A UNIT GOING OUT BASICALLY WHEN THE SUNNI AWAKENING BEGAN AS THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:38.572" end="00:05:42.643">ORGANIZATION LIKE, THEY BASICALLY USED INFORMANTS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.643" end="00:05:49.283">AT SOME POINT THESE GUYS WOULD GO OUT WITH U.S. SOLDIERS AND SAY WE KNOW WHO THE BAD GUYS ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.283" end="00:05:51.318">THEY WOULD PICK OUT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.318" end="00:05:52.920">THIS IS SOUTH OF BAGHDAD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.920" end="00:05:55.556">THEY WENT OUT TO A RAID TO DIFFERENT VILLAGES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.556" end="00:05:57.090">THEY WOULD BE JUST LIKE, OH,</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.090" end="00:05:58.692">THAT GUY, HE LIKES AL QAEDA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.692" end="00:06:01.895">I THINK THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO SELL THEMSELVES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.895" end="00:06:06.033">THIS IS A GUY WHO IS JUST BASICALLY SLEEPING IN A MECHANIC&apos;S SHOP OUTSIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.033" end="00:06:08.035">IT WAS 120 DEGREES DURING THE DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.035" end="00:06:11.538">MOST PEOPLE SLEEP OUTSIDE AT NIGHT BECAUSE THERE&apos;S NO ELECTRICITY FOR AIR CONDITIONING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.538" end="00:06:13.874">THEY JUST WOKE HIM UP AND JUST ARRESTED HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.874" end="00:06:15.609">HE&apos;S JUST TOTALLY SLEEPING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.609" end="00:06:20.681">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE JUST BEHIND THEM WITH A CAMERA LIKE (SNAPPING) DO YOU HAVE A FLASH?</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.681" end="00:06:22.683">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.683" end="00:06:24.885">THAT&apos;S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE NIGHT VISION.</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.885" end="00:06:30.624">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW TO BE FAIR TO YOUR WIFE WHO YOU KEEP SAYING, WHAT DOES YOUR WIFE DO FOR A LIVE SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.624" end="00:06:32.793">&gt;&gt; SAME THING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.793" end="00:06:34.628">&gt;&gt; Jon: IRAQ PERSPECTIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.628" end="00:06:35.963">WHAT YOU DO IS UNBELIEVABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.963" end="00:06:36.563">YOU KNOW THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.563" end="00:06:39.099">YOU KNOW HOW ANGRY WE WERE WITH YOU THAT WHOLE DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.099" end="00:06:45.372">HE WAS JUST HANGING OUT WITH US AND THE WHOLE TIME HE WAS JUST TAKING PICTURES GOING,</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.372" end="00:06:49.309">&quot;THESE GUYS ARE SUCH PUSSIES.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:06:49.309" end="00:06:53.447">&gt;&gt; I DID IT FOR THE SCHWAG.</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.447" end="00:06:57.284">I REALLY LIKE THE BARBECUE COLOGNE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.284" end="00:07:01.054">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHING) THERE&apos;S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.054" end="00:07:03.156">IRAQ PERSPECTIVES ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.156" end="00:07:05.626">WHAT IS THE NEXT PLACE YOU&apos;RE TRAVEL TO GO.</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.626" end="00:07:07.461">&gt;&gt; TO HAITI IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.461" end="00:07:08.295">&gt;&gt; Jon: A VACATION.</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.295" end="00:07:10.030">TROPICAL.</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.030" end="00:07:10.864">YOU&apos;LL HAVE A GOOD TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.864" end="00:07:11.932">IT&apos;S NICE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.932" end="00:07:13.200">TAKING THE WIFE?</p>
