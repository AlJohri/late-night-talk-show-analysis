<p begin="00:00:06.940" end="00:00:10.577">MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE FORMER NEWSPAPER REPORTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.577" end="00:00:13.780">THEY CURRENTLY WORK AS POLITICAL OPPOSITION RESEARCHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.780" end="00:00:19.253">THEIR NEW BOOK IS CALLED TWO INSIDERS WHO SEE THE DARK SIDE OF AMERICAN POLITICS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.253" end="00:00:22.189">PLEASE WELCOME THEM TO THE SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.189" end="00:00:25.792">(  <span tts:fontStyle="italic">CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</span> HELLO, ALAN AND MICHAEL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.792" end="00:00:30.797">COME AND SIT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.797" end="00:00:32.199">THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.199" end="00:00:37.704">MY FIRST QUESTION IS, WHO ARE YOU WORKING FOR?</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.704" end="00:00:42.910">NOW, EVEN THE FACT THAT YOU&apos;VE PUT IT OUT IN A PAPERBACK GIVES IT A SENSE OF INTRIGUE </p>
<p begin="00:00:42.910" end="00:00:46.280">AND C.I.A.-TYPE FREE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.280" end="00:00:50.817">LIKE I&apos;M SUPPOSED TO PUT THIS IN A BAG AND THEN DELIVER IT TO SOMEBODY IN A PARK AND THEN </p>
<p begin="00:00:50.817" end="00:00:53.654">THEY READ IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.654" end="00:00:55.656">IT&apos;S ALL VERY NERVE WRACKING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.656" end="00:01:01.595">YOU&apos;RE THE GUYS KNOW SHOW UP AT A LOCAL COURTHOUSE AND SAY,</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.595" end="00:01:06.133">WE WERE WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON SO-AND-SO?</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.133" end="00:01:06.834">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.834" end="00:01:09.937">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU TELL THEM WHO YOU&apos;RE WORKING FOR?</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.937" end="00:01:11.905">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S WHY WE CALL THE BOOK NOBODY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.905" end="00:01:16.310">BECAUSE WHEN WE GO IN THERE AND START ASKING QUESTIONS USUALLY IT&apos;S ABOUT A </p>
<p begin="00:01:16.310" end="00:01:17.511">POLITICIAN THEY KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.511" end="00:01:19.813">THEY ALREADY KNOW WHO IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.813" end="00:01:21.815">THEY&apos;RE CURIOUS WHO WE&apos;RE WITH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.815" end="00:01:25.385">THEY ALWAYS SAY WHO ARE YOU WITH TO GET INFORMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.385" end="00:01:26.854">WE ALWAYS SAY WE&apos;RE WITH NOBODY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.854" end="00:01:28.555">SOMETIMES I&apos;LL SAY I&apos;M WITH HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.555" end="00:01:31.491">THAT SORT OF THROWS THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.491" end="00:01:35.529">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT GOES INTO ABBOTT AND COSTELLO TERRITORY PRETTY FAST.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.529" end="00:01:36.396">&gt;&gt; NOSE DIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.396" end="00:01:41.301">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW, DO THEY EVER IN THE MOVIES I IMAGINE YOU&apos;D BE </p>
<p begin="00:01:41.301" end="00:01:45.105">WORKING AND YOU WOULD FIND THE FILE AND THEN THE MUSIC.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.105" end="00:01:46.540">THE JAWS MUSIC OR WHATEVER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.540" end="00:01:52.145">THEY WOULD RUN TO THE PHONE AND THEN THE LOCAL SHERIFF WHO IS ON THE TAKE WOULD COME AND </p>
<p begin="00:01:52.145" end="00:01:55.782">YOU WOULD BE RUNNING FOR YOUR LIVES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.782" end="00:01:58.185">WHAT IS IT IN REALITY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.185" end="00:02:03.323">&gt;&gt; WE USUALLY HAVE A COUPLE OF THUGS THAT FOLLOW US IN A PICK- UP TRUCK FOR A COUPLE DAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.323" end="00:02:04.892">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT REALLY TRUE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.892" end="00:02:05.259">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.259" end="00:02:07.427">&gt;&gt; Jon: THUGS IN A PICK-UP TRUCK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.427" end="00:02:09.096">&gt;&gt; A RUSTY PICK-UP TRUCK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.096" end="00:02:11.465">&gt;&gt; Jon: THUGS IN A RUSTY PICK-UP TRUCK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.465" end="00:02:12.099">&gt;&gt; CORRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.099" end="00:02:16.803">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY CAN&apos;T THUGS BEAT UP ENOUGH PEOPLE TO BUY A BETTER TRUCK?</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.803" end="00:02:18.605">REALLY SAD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.605" end="00:02:24.077">DO YOU ONLY WORK FOR ONE... IN OPPOSITION RESEARCH, DO RESEARCHERS GENERALLY WORK FOR </p>
<p begin="00:02:24.077" end="00:02:25.879">ONE PARTY OR BOTH PARTIES?</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.879" end="00:02:27.080">&gt;&gt; ONE PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.080" end="00:02:29.316">&gt;&gt; WE WORK FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.316" end="00:02:29.883">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.883" end="00:02:32.853">BUT YOUR COUNTERPART THEN WOULD WORK FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.853" end="00:02:33.587">DO YOU KNOW THEM?</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.587" end="00:02:34.254">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.254" end="00:02:37.524">WE NEVER SEE THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.524" end="00:02:42.429">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;LL WALK INTO A COURTHOUSE AND THE CLERK WILL SAY SOMEBODY WAS JUST HERE </p>
<p begin="00:02:42.429" end="00:02:47.000">ASKING FOR THAT SAME INFORMATION, KIND OF LIKE AN ALFRED HITCHCOCK THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.000" end="00:02:49.670">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY&apos;RE LOOKING FOR DIRT ON THEIR OWN GUY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.670" end="00:02:57.744">&gt;&gt; YEAH BECAUSE WE LOOK FOR OUR GUY TOO BECAUSE IF YOU WERE RUNNING FOR OFFICE-- SGOD </p>
<p begin="00:02:57.744" end="00:03:03.250">FORBID-- (  <span tts:fontStyle="italic">CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</span> </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.250" end="00:03:05.619">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M GOING TO MAKE YOUR LIVES MUCH EASIER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.619" end="00:03:08.689">THERE&apos;S A PICTURE OF ME AT A PARTY IN COLLEGE WITH MY BALLS </p>
<p begin="00:03:08.689" end="00:03:12.793">IN A TUB OF &quot;I CAN&apos;T BELIEVE IT&apos;S NOT BUTTER.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:12.793" end="00:03:16.196">LET&apos;S JUST END IT RIGHT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.196" end="00:03:18.465">SO YOU&apos;RE LOOKING FOR YOUR GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.465" end="00:03:21.668">WHAT IF YOU FIND SOMETHING DAMAGING ON YOUR GUY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.668" end="00:03:26.306">&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, WE DON&apos;T WIN ANY POPULARITY CONTEST BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO IN AND </p>
<p begin="00:03:26.306" end="00:03:28.442">THEM THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.442" end="00:03:29.309">YOU HOPE YOU DON&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.309" end="00:03:30.611">THAT&apos;S WHAT THEY PAY US TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.611" end="00:03:35.549">WE LOOK AT OUR GUY JUST AS VIGOROUSLY AS WE DO OUR OPPONENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.549" end="00:03:40.087">SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO GO IN AND GIVE THEM THE NEWS THAT THERE&apos;S SOME STUFF THERE </p>
<p begin="00:03:40.087" end="00:03:40.821">THAT&apos;S NOT GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.821" end="00:03:43.323">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO THEY EVER SAY TO YOU, BURY THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.323" end="00:03:45.926">MAKE THIS GO AWAY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.926" end="00:03:50.597">DO THEY EVER SAY IT IN THIS TONE OF VOICE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.597" end="00:03:53.700">BURY THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.700" end="00:03:56.203">MAKE THIS GO AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.203" end="00:04:00.073">&gt;&gt; UNFORTUNATELY ONCE WE DIG IT UP WE CAN&apos;T REALLY BURY IT AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.073" end="00:04:01.141">IT&apos;S ALREADY OUT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.141" end="00:04:01.542">SO, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.542" end="00:04:03.043">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT DO THEY SAY SNIT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.043" end="00:04:07.047">&gt;&gt; YEAH, A COUPLE OF TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.047" end="00:04:08.715">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU GET&gt;n-&quot; TO DECIDE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.715" end="00:04:12.386">YOUR GOAL IS BASICALLY YOU&apos;RE SAYING BASICALLY LIKE WE&apos;RE JUST FINDING OUT THE TRUTH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.386" end="00:04:12.886">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.886" end="00:04:18.458">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT AS YOU KNOW LIKE THOSE LARGE THINGS ARE MANY SHADES OF GRAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.458" end="00:04:21.728">TO USE SOMETHING IN A POLITICAL AD, PEOPLE BEND THAT ALL THE TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.728" end="00:04:24.464">DO YOU HAVE ANY SAY IN HOW THIS STUFF IS USED?</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.464" end="00:04:25.499">&gt;&gt; NOT GENERALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.499" end="00:04:31.538">WE GET TO SEE WHEN IT GOES TO THE POLLSTER WE LOOK AT THE QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE THEY&apos;RE ACCURATE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.538" end="00:04:36.143">WHEN THE MEDIA GUYS RIGHT A SCRIPT WE MAKE SURE IT&apos;S ACCURATE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.143" end="00:04:39.346">FOR THE MOST PART OUR PART OF THE JOB IS DONE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.346" end="00:04:44.618">&gt;&gt; Jon: HAVE YOU DONE RESEARCH ON A CANDIDATE, 200 PAGES ON HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.618" end="00:04:48.388">YOU THOUGHT TO YOURSELF PRETTY DECENT GUY BUT HERE&apos;S THE ONE THING WE FOUND.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.388" end="00:04:50.557">I CAN&apos;T SEE HOW THIS IS GOING TO CRUSH HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.557" end="00:04:53.894">HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH... ANDSFU<![CDATA[&lt;]]>ï¿½ YOU WATCH THAT BEING DONE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.894" end="00:04:55.495">HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.495" end="00:05:00.701">LET&apos;S JUST SAY SOUL WATCH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.701" end="00:05:02.269">&gt;&gt; IT DEPENDS ON WHAT IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.269" end="00:05:08.642">WE HAD A GUY THAT HAD BEEN ARRESTED FOR THROWING A PIPE BOMB AT A HOME COMING FLOAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.642" end="00:05:11.044">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT WOULD NOT BE A SHADE OF GRAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.044" end="00:05:13.914">I&apos;M TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY THAT HAS DONE THE RIGHT THING,</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.914" end="00:05:15.716">SEEMS LIKE AN UPSTANDING GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.716" end="00:05:20.320">HAD SOMETHING IN HIS PAST THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ILLEGAL BUT CLEARLY IN THIS ELECTION WOULD </p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:21.054">BE DAMAGING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.054" end="00:05:22.389">WHAT DO YOU DO?</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.389" end="00:05:24.658">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE STILL GOING TO TURN IT INTO THE CAMPAIGN BUT WE&apos;RE </p>
<p begin="00:05:24.658" end="00:05:28.762">GOING TO BASICALLY TELL THEM THIS GUY LOOKS CLEAN OVERALL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.762" end="00:05:30.430">IF YOU GO OUT THERE WITH THIS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.430" end="00:05:33.066">THE ODDS ARE IT&apos;S GOING TO MAKE YOU LOOK BAD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.066" end="00:05:37.104">THEY USUALLY DON&apos;T WANT TO DO IT ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE ALWAYS AFRAID OF THE BLOW-BACK </p>
<p begin="00:05:37.104" end="00:05:38.105">FROM GOING NEGATIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.105" end="00:05:40.340">YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW IT TO WATCH TV.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.340" end="00:05:45.579">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THERE A LAIR UNDERNEATH YOU GUYS OF THE GUYS THAT WEAR THE GLOVES?</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.579" end="00:05:48.882">AND CARRY 1920s WEAPONS AND DO THINGS LIKE THAT?</p>
