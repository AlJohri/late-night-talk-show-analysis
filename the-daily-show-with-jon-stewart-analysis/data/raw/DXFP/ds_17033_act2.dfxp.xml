<p begin="00:00:03.604" end="00:00:09.109">AS YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK JUST THIS PAST WEEK I DECLARED WAR ON CHRISTMAS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.109" end="00:00:12.746">IT&apos;S PROBABLY WHY WE HAVEN&apos;T HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT CHRISTMAS RECENTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.746" end="00:00:18.185">ANYWAY, AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE SANTITY OF CHRISTMAS DAY AND THE ENSUING FOUR-MONTH </p>

<p begin="00:00:39.072" end="00:00:44.077">SANTITY OF CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS THAT A 7/11 DOES TODAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.077" end="00:00:46.613">YEAH, WE&apos;RE OPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.613" end="00:00:47.714">A FUNNY STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.714" end="00:00:53.654">APPARENTLY THE CLIP WE SHOWED WAS OFF BY AROUND 66 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.654" end="00:01:00.694">FOR THIS MISTAKE I WAS AWARDED THE FACT-CHECKING SITE POLITIFACT DOT-COM&apos;S LOWEST </p>

<p begin="00:01:24.284" end="00:01:29.623">YOU KNOW, WITH FACTS ABOUT THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.623" end="00:01:36.463">THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, WE&apos;LL ALL FIND OUT THE NAZIS DID NOT EMPLOY ALIEN TECHNOLOGY IN </p>
