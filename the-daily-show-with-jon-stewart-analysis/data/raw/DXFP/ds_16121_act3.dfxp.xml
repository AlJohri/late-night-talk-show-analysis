<p begin="00:00:04.538" end="00:00:06.139">YOU DIDN&apos;T SEE THE WHOLE INTERVIEW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.139" end="00:00:06.940">THERE&apos;S MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.940" end="00:00:08.876">ON THE WEBB.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.876" end="00:00:18.952">&quot;ON THE WEBB.&quot; DOES THE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT ADEQUATELY THOUGH </p>
<p begin="00:00:18.952" end="00:00:23.323">MAKE IT A FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT HAVING THAT RESPONSIBILITY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.323" end="00:00:28.962">DOES THEIR INABILITY TO DO IT EFFECTIVELY MAKE IT SO THAT THEY SHOULDN&apos;T DO IT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.962" end="00:00:33.734">&gt;&gt; IN A WAY ESPECIALLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, YOU KNOW, UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION....</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.734" end="00:00:36.837">&gt;&gt; Jon: AREN&apos;T THEY A MARKET SYSTEM?</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.837" end="00:00:40.207">WOULDN&apos;T YOU RATHER HAVE PEOPLE REGULATING THAT ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO VOTERS THAN </p>
<p begin="00:00:40.207" end="00:00:44.278">CORPORATIONS REGULATING THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO SHAREHOLDERS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.278" end="00:00:46.346">ISN&apos;T OUR SYSTEM...</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.346" end="00:00:47.648">(  <span tts:fontStyle="italic">CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</span> </p>
<p begin="00:00:47.648" end="00:00:49.750">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.750" end="00:00:57.024">I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY AS UNFAIR OR MAYBE NOT AS GOOD AS IT COULD BE AT LEAST THEY&apos;RE </p>
<p begin="00:00:57.024" end="00:00:57.858">ACCOUNTABLE TO US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.858" end="00:00:59.927">&gt;&gt; BUT THE REGULATIONS ARE STRICTER IN THE MARKETPLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.927" end="00:01:02.930">FOR INSTANCE THE REGULATIONS...</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.930" end="00:01:06.333">THE REGULATORS HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THE HOUSING INDUSTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.333" end="00:01:07.835">WE HAVE MORE MORTGAGE COMPANIES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.835" end="00:01:09.069">THEY HAD A BIG BUBBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.069" end="00:01:13.240">THEY MADE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAD A HOUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.240" end="00:01:15.275">WELL THEY GO BROKE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.275" end="00:01:16.910">THE REGULATORS GOT BAILED OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.910" end="00:01:18.812">THE PEOPLE WHO CONTROLLED THE REGULATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.812" end="00:01:20.380">THEY BAIL OUT THE BIG COMPANIES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.380" end="00:01:23.884">THE MIDDLE CLASS LOSE THEIR JOBS AND THEY LOSE THEIR HOUSES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.884" end="00:01:30.457">SO ALL THIS TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT BIG CORPORATIONS WON&apos;T HURT </p>
<p begin="00:01:30.457" end="00:01:33.760">THEM ACTUALLY IS A BACKFIRE ON THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.760" end="00:01:38.999">THE REGULATIONS ARE MUCH TOUGHER IN THE FREE MARKET BECAUSE YOU CANNOT COMMIT FRAUD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.999" end="00:01:40.000">YOU CANNOT STEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:41.702">YOU CANNOT HURT PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.702" end="00:01:46.173">AND THE FAILURE HAS COME THAT GOVERNMENT WOULDN&apos;T ENFORCE THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.173" end="00:01:48.108">IN THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION,</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.108" end="00:01:49.243">THERE WAS A COLLUSION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.243" end="00:01:50.244">YOU COULD POLLUTE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.244" end="00:01:51.445">THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.445" end="00:01:57.251">BUT IN A TRUE FREE MARKET IN A LIBERTARIAN SOCIETY YOU CAN&apos;T DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.251" end="00:02:00.654">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU&apos;RE SAYING A TRUE LIBERTARIAN SOCIETY YOU HAVE </p>
<p begin="00:02:00.654" end="00:02:01.221">TO BE RESPONSIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.221" end="00:02:05.092">HAS THAT EVER BEEN TRIED?</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.092" end="00:02:10.631">BECAUSE I THINK IT&apos;S AN HONEST QUESTION TO SAY, IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN YOU SAY, WELL, THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:10.631" end="00:02:12.566">FREE MARKET WOULD ACTUALLY REGULATE THAT MUCH BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.566" end="00:02:17.371">BUT I THINK IT&apos;S HARD FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:17.371" end="00:02:21.141">FEEL LIKE THAT IS IN ANY WAY NOT A PIPE DREAM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.141" end="00:02:24.878">I DON&apos;T MEAN THAT AS....</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.878" end="00:02:25.546">( APPLAUSE ) </p>
<p begin="00:02:25.546" end="00:02:28.315">&gt;&gt; NO, IT&apos;S BEEN TRIED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.315" end="00:02:35.455">IT&apos;S NEVER BEEN PERFECT BUT HAS SOCIALISM AND AUTHORITARIANISM EVER BEEN PERFECT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.455" end="00:02:36.089">IT&apos;S HORRIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.089" end="00:02:37.891">YOU LOSE ALL YOUR FREEDOMS THAT WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.891" end="00:02:41.195">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT OUR CHOICE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.195" end="00:02:44.398">AUTHORITARIANISM AND TYRANNY OR A FREE MARKET THAT WE MUST TRUST?</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.398" end="00:02:47.901">ISN&apos;T THERE A GROUND OF KPE DENSE....</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.901" end="00:02:50.838">&gt;&gt; I THINK IF YOU PLANT A SEED IT TENDS TO GROW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.838" end="00:02:56.210">I USED TO NEVER BE ABLE TO GET AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.210" end="00:02:58.579">WITH TELLING A WOMAN IT&apos;S A TOUCH OF PREGNANCY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.579" end="00:02:59.746">IT DOESN&apos;T WORK THAT WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.746" end="00:03:02.282">IF YOU GET GOVERNMENT INVOLVED THERE TENDS TO BE A GROWTH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.282" end="00:03:07.154">A LITTLE BIT OF INCOME TAX, 1% AND THEN BEFORE YOU HAVE A MONSTER OUT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.154" end="00:03:08.655">SO, NO, IT GROWS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.655" end="00:03:12.826">WHEN YOU GIVE UP 100% OF THE PRINCIPLE IF YOU START SAYING THE GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.826" end="00:03:17.064">UNDER OUR SYSTEM SINCE I DON&apos;T EXPECT A PERFECT SOCIETY OR A PERFECT FREE SOCIETY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.064" end="00:03:18.465">BUT WE HAD A GRAND EXPERIMENT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.465" end="00:03:21.702">THE BEST EVER AND THE FREEEST AND THE MOST PROSPEROUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.702" end="00:03:25.873">BUT ONE OF THE RULES THEY HAD TO SORT OF TAKE CARE OF THIS BLEND THAT YOU MIGHT BE </p>
<p begin="00:03:25.873" end="00:03:28.809">LOOKING FOR IS THAT WE HAVE NO PROHIBITIONS AGAINST THE STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.809" end="00:03:34.147">SO IF YOU SORT OF LIKE THIS STUFF, YOU KNOW, LET BLOOMBERG WRITE ALL THE REGULATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.147" end="00:03:36.149">LET SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.149" end="00:03:41.421">&gt;&gt; Jon: OPPRESSION IS NOT OKAY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT IF YOUR STATE WANTS TO OPPRESS </p>
<p begin="00:03:41.421" end="00:03:44.591">YOU... I GOT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.591" end="00:03:45.859">&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.859" end="00:03:48.929">YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER IT IF IT&apos;S LOCAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.929" end="00:03:52.933">IT&apos;S NOT LIKE SAYING THAT YOU WERE ARGUING THE CASE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF </p>
<p begin="00:03:52.933" end="00:03:54.968">GOVERNMENT TO RESCUE THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY NEED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.968" end="00:03:59.706">DO IT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU WE&apos;RE NOT VERY EFFICIENT IN WASHINGTON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.706" end="00:04:02.776">YOU KNOW, WE&apos;VE RUN UP A DEBT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.776" end="00:04:05.179">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;VE HEARD ABOUT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.179" end="00:04:08.649">&gt;&gt; JUST THINK ABOUT IT, IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH THESE THINGS,</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.649" end="00:04:10.083">THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THE PENTAGON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.083" end="00:04:15.556">DO YOU WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO THE PENTAGON OR THE C.I.A. OR THE T.S.A.?</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.556" end="00:04:21.395">AND SEE HOW GOOD THEY ARE SNONT YOU WON&apos;T WORRY THAT THE STATES WOULD DEVELOP THEIR OWN MECHANISMS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.395" end="00:04:28.368">&gt;&gt; LET&apos;S HOPE THE PEOPLE WOULD WORK ON IT AND MAKE IT, YOU KNOW, DUE... DECENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.368" end="00:04:30.804">THAT WAS THE WONDERFUL PART ABOUT OUR COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.804" end="00:04:37.477">LOOK HOW THE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS IN SOME OF THE MID WESTERN STATES DESTROYED THEIR JOBS </p>
<p begin="00:04:37.477" end="00:04:41.248">AND THEY MOVED SOUTH BECAUSE THEY HAD MORE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR WORKING </p>
<p begin="00:04:41.248" end="00:04:43.617">CONDITIONS AND LESS TAXES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.617" end="00:04:45.285">SO PEOPLE MIGRATED DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.285" end="00:04:47.688">BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE WHOLE COUNTRY....</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.688" end="00:04:49.990">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW IT&apos;S A GLOBAL CORRECTION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.990" end="00:04:52.793">WE HAVE TO GO DOWN ALL THE WAY TO LIKE CHINA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.793" end="00:04:56.230">&gt;&gt; WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT WE&apos;VE UNDERMINED OUR WHOLE ENVIRONMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.230" end="00:04:57.764">OUR MONETARY SYSTEM, OUR TAX SYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.764" end="00:04:58.999">THE REGULATORY SYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.999" end="00:05:00.234">SO THERE&apos;S NO PLACE TO GO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.234" end="00:05:01.835">SO THEY DO GO OVERSEAS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.835" end="00:05:04.771">WE&apos;VE CHASED OUR JOBS OVERSEAS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.771" end="00:05:07.107">THAT&apos;S STRONGLY RELATED TO THE MONETARY SYSTEM TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.107" end="00:05:09.142">WHEN YOU PRINT MONEY IT&apos;S A GOOD EXPORT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.142" end="00:05:10.344">JUST EXPORT OUR MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.344" end="00:05:13.046">AS LONG AS THEY TAKE IT, WE CAN BUY STUFF FOR FREE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.046" end="00:05:14.248">THAT&apos;S OUR BIG PROBLEM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.248" end="00:05:16.884">&gt;&gt; Jon: LISTEN, IT&apos;S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.884" end="00:05:18.452">I ALWAYS ENJOY OUR CONVERSATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.452" end="00:05:23.323">YOU REALLY ARE ONE OF OUR LAST CONSISTENT POLITICIANS WE SEE IN THIS WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.323" end="00:05:24.291">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.291" end="00:05:27.594">&gt;&gt; Jon: CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL.</p>
