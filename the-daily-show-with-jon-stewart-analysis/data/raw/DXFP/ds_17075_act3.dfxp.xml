<p begin="00:01:28.488" end="00:01:30.324">CONGRESSMAN WECHSLER, A LITTLE HELP HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.324" end="00:01:35.596">&gt;&gt; THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT TROUBLES THE ENTIRE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.596" end="00:01:36.296">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S GOOD.</p>

<p begin="00:01:44.872" end="00:01:49.309">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A GOOD POINT THAT LOOKS GOOD WRITTEN DOWN AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.309" end="00:01:53.113">&gt;&gt; NOW I JUST HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT TO SOME UNESCO PROJECTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.113" end="00:01:56.450">ONCE UPON A TIME 20 YEARS AGO THERE WAS A U.S.</p>

<p begin="00:02:03.690" end="00:02:06.059">AND THAT IS WHY YOU CAN&apos;T HAVE BOOKS ANY MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.059" end="00:02:10.163">IT WASN&apos;T THAT HARD A CONCEPT TO UNDERSTAND.</p>

<p begin="00:02:16.270" end="00:02:20.574">BUT STRANGELY, SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DIDN&apos;T FEEL QUITE RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.574" end="00:02:25.212">&gt;&gt; JUST REMIND ME WHY CUTTING OFF UNESCO&apos;S FUNDING IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE IT&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:02:25.212" end="00:02:26.580">STARTING TO FEEL REALLY BAD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.580" end="00:02:29.383">&gt;&gt; IT ISN&apos;T, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR-- YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR FOCUS ON THE </p>

<p begin="00:02:30.350" end="00:02:30.984">&gt;&gt; BIG PICTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.984" end="00:02:34.788">&gt;&gt; THE BIG PICTURE WHICH IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.788" end="00:02:35.155">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.155" end="00:02:41.295">&gt;&gt; WAS TO ENCOURAGE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN ITS ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS TO REACH A JUST </p>
<p begin="00:02:41.295" end="00:02:42.963">AND COMPREHENSIVE PEACE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.963" end="00:02:44.665">THAT EAT BIG PICTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.665" end="00:02:48.569">YOU HAVE TO THINK BIG PICTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.569" end="00:02:52.472">YOU ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.472" end="00:02:57.411">ISRAEL AND PALESTINE MUST NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY FOR PEACE OTHERWISE IF JUST DOESN&apos;T COUNT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.411" end="00:02:59.680">U.S. IS A NATION OF LAWS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:01.381">&gt;&gt; THIS WAS PROVING TO BE TRICKY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.381" end="00:03:03.717">BUT REALLY, IT WAS SO SIMPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.717" end="00:03:06.486">&gt;&gt; THE LAW IS THE LAW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.486" end="00:03:07.521">CONCRETE, THE LAW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.521" end="00:03:08.188">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.188" end="00:03:11.758">&gt;&gt; AND GUESS WHAT, AMERICA JUST CAN&apos;T UNDO OUR LAWS LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.758" end="00:03:14.962">&gt;&gt; THE LAW IS CONCRETE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.962" end="00:03:16.363">&gt;&gt; NO EXCEPTIONS.</p>

<p begin="00:03:18.398" end="00:03:23.237">NOT EVEN FOR A COLLEGE ALSO FACING THE LOSS OF CRITICAL UNESCO FUNDING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.237" end="00:03:25.272">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S VERY SIMPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.272" end="00:03:30.077">AMERICA CANNOT CHANGE ITS LAWS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.077" end="00:03:31.745">&gt;&gt; WHY CAN&apos;T YOU CHANGE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.745" end="00:03:33.780">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A GOOD QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.780" end="00:03:37.551">&gt;&gt; ITS ACTUALLY MADE PERFECT SENSE WHEN I WAS BACK IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.551" end="00:03:40.654">&gt;&gt; SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO THIS WOMAN THAT OUR LAWS CAN&apos;T BE CHANGED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.654" end="00:03:43.090">&gt;&gt; NO, CONGRESS COULD OVERTURN THIS LAW IF IT WISHED.</p>

<p begin="00:03:44.091" end="00:03:46.093">&gt;&gt; OF COURSE IT COULD.</p>
