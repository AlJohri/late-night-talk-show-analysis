<p begin="00:00:03.003" end="00:00:08.108">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.108" end="00:00:09.276">SOME THINGS EVERYONE KNOWS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.276" end="00:00:14.348">PIZZA TASTES GOOD NO MATTER WHERE IT&apos;S FROM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.348" end="00:00:18.886">LEPRECHAUNS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO CATCH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.886" end="00:00:20.254">AND THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.254" end="00:00:23.891">&gt;&gt; THE TRUTH IS THAT NPR IS A LIBERAL ORGANIZATION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.891" end="00:00:25.859">IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.859" end="00:00:28.262">NPR HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE LIBERAL FOR DECADES NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.262" end="00:00:31.398">&gt;&gt; Jon: DECADES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.398" end="00:00:33.867">AT LEAST TWO ACCORDING TO THAT GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.867" end="00:00:35.269">PRETTY YOUNG.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.269" end="00:00:43.010">BUT WE ALL REMEMBER SITTING AROUND IN THE 1960s LISTEN TO THE WAIT, WAIT, DON&apos;T DRAFT ME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.010" end="00:00:52.186">SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW PLEASED NPR WOULD BE WHEN THEY FOUND OUT WORLD OF OPERA HOST LISA </p>
<p begin="00:00:52.186" end="00:00:58.659">SIMEONE AND CAITLYN CURRAN WERE SUPPORTING THE OCCUPY ORGANIZATION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.659" end="00:01:02.329">IT&apos;S WRONG TO CREATE A MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITY FILLED WITH LOANS YOU KNOW ARE </p>
<p begin="00:01:02.329" end="00:01:10.838">GOING TO SALE SO YOU CAN SELL IT TO A CLIENT BY PICKING THE LOAN MOST LIKELY TO BE DEFAULTED UPON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.838" end="00:01:13.340">THAT WAS WHAT THE SIGN SAID.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.340" end="00:01:19.780">BY THE WAY, THAT IS A MUCH BETTER BUMPER STICKER THAN A SIGN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.780" end="00:01:22.816">I FOLLOWED THAT GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.816" end="00:01:24.318">NPR WASN&apos;T PLEASED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.318" end="00:01:31.491">THEY GOT RID OF BOTH INDIVIDUALS SO THEY&apos;LL NEVER HAVE TO HERE CRITICISM LIKE THIS AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.491" end="00:01:36.396">&gt;&gt; WHY DON&apos;T WE HAVE TAX PAYER DOLLARS FUNDING FOX NEWS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.396" end="00:01:41.101">&gt;&gt; WHY SHOULD WE PAY ONE TAX PAYER DOLLAR FOR NPR?</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.101" end="00:01:46.206">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY NOT FUND SEAN HANNITY&apos;S SHOW BECAUSE HIS SHOW AND NPR ARE REALLY THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:46.206" end="00:01:48.175">SAME THING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.175" end="00:01:49.776">JUST FROM DIFFERENT SIDES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.776" end="00:01:55.148">THERE&apos;S JUST ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT COMPARISON, THEY&apos;RE NOTHING LIKE THE SAME THING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.148" end="00:01:56.917">HERE&apos;S CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.917" end="00:02:00.053">&gt;&gt; THE SOCIALIST IN THE WHITE HOUSE, HE&apos;S DESTROYED OUR </p>
<p begin="00:02:00.053" end="00:02:03.924">NATION&apos;S FINANCES AND HE HAS NOW SMOTHERED THE PRIVATE SECTOR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.924" end="00:02:08.929">WE NEED AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO DEFEAT OBAMA AND THE AMERICAN LEFT BEFORE THEY ROB </p>
<p begin="00:02:08.929" end="00:02:13.967">ALL OF US OF EVERYTHING THAT OUR ANCESTORS, OUR BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY HAVE </p>
<p begin="00:02:13.967" end="00:02:16.203">FOUGHT AND BLED AND DIED TO PRESERVE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.203" end="00:02:19.373">&gt;&gt; WE NEED TO DEFEAT THESE BASTARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.373" end="00:02:20.908">WE NEED TO WIPE THEM OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.908" end="00:02:24.545">WE NEED TO CHASE THEM OUT OF TOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.545" end="00:02:27.114">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE MONSTER IS LOOSE IN THE VILLAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.114" end="00:02:32.553">GRAB YOUR PITCH FORK AND YOUR TORCHES AND WE SHALL ATTACK!</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.553" end="00:02:41.862">SO IF NPR IS TALK RADIO&apos;S EQUAL AND OPPOSITE, THAT MUST MEAN THAT THEIR SHOWS URGE </p>
<p begin="00:02:41.862" end="00:02:45.966">LISTENERS TO GET A ROPE AND GO REPUBLICAN-HUNTING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.966" end="00:02:48.669">&gt;&gt; MICHELLE BERNARD YOUR REACTION TO PRESIDENT OBAMA&apos;S SPEECH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.669" end="00:02:53.707">&gt;&gt; MY REACTION IS I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE&apos;S SAYING AND I&apos;VE HEARD OTHERS SAY IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.707" end="00:02:56.310">IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT&apos;S SPEECH TONIGHT IT WAS A VERY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.310" end="00:03:01.448">VERY STARK CONTRAST TO ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SPEECH YOU HEARD BY PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH WHEN </p>
<p begin="00:03:01.448" end="00:03:03.050">HE TALKED ABOUT IRAQ.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.050" end="00:03:04.618">&gt;&gt; E.J., JUST BACK TO YOU,</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.618" end="00:03:08.589">WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE PRESIDENT&apos;S CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT&apos;S BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN IRAQ?</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.589" end="00:03:15.162">&gt;&gt; I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MICHELLE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.162" end="00:03:23.504">&gt;&gt; Jon: ((BEEP) OH, MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.504" end="00:03:25.839">I HOPE THEY WERE AT LEAST NAKED IN THE STUDIO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.839" end="00:03:27.241">THAT&apos;S ALL I CAN SAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.241" end="00:03:27.941">SEE THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.941" end="00:03:32.279">THE REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE RADIO, THEY GET PEOPLE TO GO CHASE FRANKENSTEIN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.279" end="00:03:36.550">NPR, THEY DESCRIBE THE HAMLET,</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.550" end="00:03:39.219">WHERE THERE IS A MONSTER THAT&apos;S LIVING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.219" end="00:03:44.791">THEY INCITE THE LISTENERS TO BRING THEIR TORCHES AND MEET UP AT THE WINDMILL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.791" end="00:03:54.902">MAYBE A TRAVELOGUE, A CHARMING RESTAURANT WHERE THEY SERVE ARTISANAL CHEESES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.902" end="00:03:59.640">MAYBE A ROUND TABLE ABOUT THE ETHICS OF REANIMATING MONSTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.640" end="00:04:06.446">BUT I WASN&apos;T SURE ABOUT ANY OF THIS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NPR AND CONSERVATIVE RADIO </p>
<p begin="00:04:06.446" end="00:04:07.047">UNTIL LAST SUMMER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.047" end="00:04:08.182">THIS IS A TRUE STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.182" end="00:04:15.222">ON A FRIDAY EVENING I WAS DRIVING HOME IN MY PRIVATE JET-- I LIKE TO TAKE IT OUT ON THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:15.222" end="00:04:21.094">WEST SIDE HIGHWAY-- IT WAS THE DAY JOHN BOEHNER WALKED OUT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA&apos;S DEBT CEILING TALKS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.094" end="00:04:22.296">TENSIONS ARE HIGH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.296" end="00:04:23.096">NERVES ARE TRAYED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.096" end="00:04:29.736">YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO MEDIA MIRROR IMAGES AND HOW THEY WOULD HANDLE THIS EXPLOSIVE MOMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.736" end="00:04:40.080">I WEAR TO GOT, I&apos;M IN THE CAR AND THIS IS WHAT I HEAR FLIPPING BACK AND FORTH ON MY DIAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:41.114">&gt;&gt; LOOK AROUND YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.114" end="00:04:48.088">YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO TAKES ADVICE FROM MARXIST PROFESSORS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.088" end="00:04:50.524">&gt;&gt; Jon: OOWWW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.524" end="00:04:52.860">I WONDER HOW NPR WILL COUNTER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.860" end="00:04:56.296">&gt;&gt; WELL, MARK, WELCOME TO FRESH AIR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.296" end="00:05:06.874">YOUR BOOK TELLS US ABOUT SO MANY DIVERSE AND FASCINATING SPECIES OF ANTS ACROSS THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.874" end="00:05:11.678">LET&apos;S TELL THE LISTENERS ABOUT THE BULLDOG ANT OF AUSTRALIA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.678" end="00:05:12.779">&gt;&gt; Jon: (BEEP).</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.779" end="00:05:15.115">THAT IS WHAT WAS HAPPENING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.115" end="00:05:17.618">MAYBE THEY HAVEN&apos;T GOTTEN TO BREAK INTO IT YET.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.618" end="00:05:19.253">BACK TO CONSERVATIVE RADIO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.253" end="00:05:25.259">&gt;&gt; WE LITERALLY HAVE THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, WHICH IS THE PARTY OF CERTAIN DOOM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.259" end="00:05:28.161">&gt;&gt; Jon: SWITCH TO POLITICAL COVERAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.161" end="00:05:32.366">&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SEE A SWARM OF ANTS, I MEAN, HOW MANY OF THEM?</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.366" end="00:05:34.168">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE ALL FEMALE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.168" end="00:05:37.971">THAT&apos;S THE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.971" end="00:05:43.310">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW I WANT TO TAKE BACK MY GOVERNMENT AND (BEEP) ANT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.310" end="00:05:45.646">I PUT BACK AND FORTH ALL THE WAY DOWN TO CAPE MAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.646" end="00:05:50.083">I COULDN&apos;T DECIDE IF THE PRESIDENT WAS A SECRET MUSLIM OR AN ANT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.083" end="00:05:50.851">THAT REALLY HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.851" end="00:05:55.923">I&apos;M NOT SAYING NPR ISN&apos;T IS A RELENTLESS ACTIVIST ORGANIZATION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.923" end="00:05:59.660">THAT DRILLS ITS MESSAGE INTO YOUR HEAD 24/7.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.660" end="00:06:04.097">IT&apos;S JUST THAT THEIR MESSAGE IS NOT POLITICAL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.097" end="00:06:06.867">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE HAVING OUR MEMBERSHIP DRIVE NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.867" end="00:06:09.403">YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS CRUCIAL TO KEEPING US GOING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.403" end="00:06:11.138">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S NOT A CALL TO ARMS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.138" end="00:06:14.842">IT&apos;S A CALL TO CALL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.842" end="00:06:19.947">THE CONSERVATIVES ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF FEAR BUT NPR IS IN THE BUSINESS OF GUILT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.947" end="00:06:23.183">EVERY TIME YOU TURN IT ON, IT JUST ASKS, &quot;YOU NEVER CALL.&quot; </p>
