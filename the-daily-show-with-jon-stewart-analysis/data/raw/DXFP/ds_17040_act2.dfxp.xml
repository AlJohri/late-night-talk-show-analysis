<p begin="00:00:04.771" end="00:00:10.210">NOW, AS WE SAW EARLIER, THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF IN-FIGHTING NOW BETWEEN REPUBLICAN </p>

<p begin="00:00:11.245" end="00:00:15.315">GETTING A LITTLE UGLY BUT THERE IS STILL ONE AREA WHERE THEY&apos;RE OF A SINGLE MIND.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.315" end="00:00:17.317">&gt;&gt; WE DON&apos;T PUT PEOPLE IN CLASSES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.317" end="00:00:23.156">&gt;&gt; THE CLASS WARFARE ARGUMENT IS A BARACK OBAMA IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE PART OF THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:23.156" end="00:00:23.690">REPUBLICAN LEXICON.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.690" end="00:00:29.663">&gt;&gt; HE CONTINUALLY WANTS TO PRACTICE CLASS WARFARE AND PUNISH SUCCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.663" end="00:00:33.433">&gt;&gt; CLASS WARFARE TO ATTACK ATTACK THE PEOPLE WHO CREATE JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.433" end="00:00:34.902">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S THEIR JOB, DIVIDE,</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.902" end="00:00:38.138">SEPARATE, PUT ONE GROUP AGAINST ANOTHER.</p>

<p begin="00:00:39.773" end="00:00:45.212">NOT LIKE THOSE UNAMERICAN LIBERAL DEMOCRATS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.212" end="00:00:51.919">THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THE POLITICS OF CLASS RESENTMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.919" end="00:00:56.723">I SEE WE HAVE A LITERACY CROWD HERE TONIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.723" end="00:01:00.227">THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THE POLITICS OF RESENTMENT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.227" end="00:01:02.796">YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE HAS NO PLACE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.796" end="00:01:04.932">RICH GUYS LIKE MITT ROMNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.932" end="00:01:09.770">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK A LIBERAL MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR IS GOING TO COME AND BE ABLE TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:09.770" end="00:01:15.275">GO AND RELATE TO FOLKS AS WELL AS A GUY WHO GREW UP AS A GRANDSON OF A COAL MINER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.275" end="00:01:18.679">&gt;&gt; I&apos;LL BET YOU $10,000, HOLY MACKERAL.</p>

<p begin="00:01:20.914" end="00:01:22.649">I GUESS NOT FOR MITT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.649" end="00:01:24.918">&gt;&gt; I CERTAINLY DON&apos;T HAVE THE KIND OF MONEY HE HAS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.918" end="00:01:30.390">&gt;&gt; GOVERNOR ROMNEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE BACK ALL THE MONEY HE&apos;S EARNED FROM BANKRUPTING </p>
<p begin="00:01:30.390" end="00:01:36.864">COMPANIES AND LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES OVER HIS YEARS, THAT I WOULD THEN BE GLAD TO LISTEN TO HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.864" end="00:01:38.365">&gt;&gt; Jon: HMMM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.365" end="00:01:44.338">YOU BELIEVE MITT ROMNEY SHOULD GIVE BACK WHAT YOU FEEL ARE ILL GOTTEN GAINS AND PERHAPS </p>

<p begin="00:01:46.907" end="00:01:52.012">WELCOME, COMRADE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.012" end="00:01:55.382">BORST IS ON THE TABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.382" end="00:01:57.117">DID I PRONOUNCE THAT RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.117" end="00:01:57.818">WAIT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.818" end="00:02:01.255">WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH HAVING UNFETTERED WEALTH?</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.255" end="00:02:09.930">&gt;&gt; I WAS JUST STRUCK BY THE POLITICO ANALYSIS OF THE SHEER VOLUME OF ANTI-GINGRICH ADS </p>
<p begin="00:02:09.930" end="00:02:11.732">RUN BY ROMNEY&apos;S PAC.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.732" end="00:02:16.937">&gt;&gt; IF HIS PAC SAYS THINGS ARE FALSE THAT&apos;S HOW WASHINGTON PLAYS THE GAME ISN&apos;T THAT </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.937" end="00:02:19.473">EXACTLY WHAT IS SICK ABOUT THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW?</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.473" end="00:02:22.409">ISN&apos;T THAT WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF?</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.409" end="00:02:24.545">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, IT&apos;S NOT FAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.545" end="00:02:28.348">HE&apos;S USING UNLIMITED MONEY TO BUY INFLUENCE, RIGGING THE SYSTEM IN SOME WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.348" end="00:02:29.082">INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.082" end="00:02:34.655">I CAN&apos;T IMAGINE HOW FRUSTRATED AND HELPLESS NEWT GINGRICH MUST FEEL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.655" end="00:02:38.091">HEY, HOW DO GUYS LIKE MITT ROMNEY COME TO BE ANYWAY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.091" end="00:02:39.860">&gt;&gt; BELIEVING IN THE BOTTOM UP,</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.860" end="00:02:42.095">BELIEVING IN FREE PEOPLE AND FREE MARKETS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.095" end="00:02:47.968">&gt;&gt; PULL BACK THE REGULATION THAT ARE STRANGLING THE AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.968" end="00:02:50.771">&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO LOWER TAX RATES CONSIDERABLY ON JOB CREATOR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.771" end="00:02:51.939">&gt;&gt; GET GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.939" end="00:02:54.408">&gt;&gt; LOWER TAXES, LESS REGULATION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.408" end="00:03:01.181">AND THE PEOPLE WHO CREATE JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.181" end="00:03:02.816">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOUR PLATFORM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.816" end="00:03:05.953">UNMITIGATED CORPORATE MONEY IN POLITICS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.953" end="00:03:07.855">HANDSOMENESS, DISTINGUISHED GRAY TEMPLES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.855" end="00:03:09.289">&gt;&gt; I STARTED MY OWN BUSINESS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.289" end="00:03:10.257">I&apos;VE LEARNED FROM THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.257" end="00:03:13.527">I LEARNED THE LESSONS OF A FREE ECONOMY OVER 25 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.527" end="00:03:15.562">CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, MY FRIEND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.562" end="00:03:18.065">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE MAD AT MITT ROMNEY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.065" end="00:03:24.271">FOR GOD&apos;S SAKES IT&apos;S LIKE MITT ROMNEY ANSWER THE REPUBLICANS&apos; </p>
<p begin="00:03:24.271" end="00:03:26.306">E-HARMONY AD AND NOW YOU&apos;RE SAYING IT&apos;S UNFAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.306" end="00:03:27.307">IT&apos;S NOT WHAT YOU MEANT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.307" end="00:03:28.809">YOU DON&apos;T MEAN IT THAT MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.809" end="00:03:33.514">MITT ROMNEY IS THE PURE DISSTILLATION OF CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.514" end="00:03:36.250">NOW THAT YOU HAVE TO GO UP AGAINST HIM NOW IT&apos;S UNFAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.250" end="00:03:42.489">REPUBLICANS, YOU CAN&apos;T SAY RELEASE THE KRACKEN AND THEN WHEN IT TURNS ON YOU, BE LIKE </p>
<p begin="00:03:42.489" end="00:03:45.926">THIS IS A VERY SCARY KRACKEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.926" end="00:03:50.364">I DIDN&apos;T REALIZE THE FEROCIOUSNESS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.364" end="00:03:56.537">DO WE HAVE A CRACK IN THE POCKET, A CRACK... PERHAPS THE CRACK-ETTES BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.537" end="00:04:01.842">IF YOU DON&apos;T MY FRIENDS AND I WILL HAVE TO TAKE TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.842" end="00:04:04.044">WE ARE THE 99%.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.044" end="00:04:06.680">OF THE 1%.</p>
