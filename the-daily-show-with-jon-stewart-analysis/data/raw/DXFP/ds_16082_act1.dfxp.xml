<p begin="00:04:15.088" end="00:04:18.792">&gt;&gt; CLEARLY MEANT TO MOLLIFY THE ANTI-WAR LEFT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.792" end="00:04:21.261">&gt;&gt; HE NEEDS TO APPEASE THE LEFT WING OF HIS OWN PARTY.</p>

<p begin="00:05:05.205" end="00:05:07.074">&gt;&gt; IN MY OPINION IT&apos;S NOT ENOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.074" end="00:05:09.877">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S GOING AT A SLOWER PACE THAN I THINK IS NECESSARY.</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.435" end="00:06:46.473">BUT IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A GAME OF TERRORIST WHACK-A-MOLE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.473" end="00:06:54.681">AND IT COST $9.7 BILLION A MONTH TO COVER ONLY TWO HOLES THAT YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE.</p>
