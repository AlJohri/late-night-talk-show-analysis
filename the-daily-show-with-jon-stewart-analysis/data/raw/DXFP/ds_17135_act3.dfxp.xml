<p begin="00:01:27.688" end="00:01:33.827">I ACTUALLY AM GLAD THAT I&apos;M NOT AT THEIR HOMES WHEN IT ARRIVES BECAUSE WE REALLY DO HAVE A DAY </p>
<p begin="00:01:33.827" end="00:01:36.163">FOR MOST OF THESE CHALLENGES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.163" end="00:01:37.798">THEY&apos;RE NOT PRETTY ON THE INSIDE.</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.341" end="00:01:57.150">BECAUSE &quot;PROJECT RUNWAY&quot; WAS ONE OF FIRST REALITY SHOWS WHERE PEOPLE HAD A DEMONSTRABLE ABILITY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.150" end="00:01:58.118">THEY HAD A REAL SKILL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.118" end="00:02:00.487">YOU WOULD PUT THEM UNDER THIS CRUCIBLE OF PRESSURE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.487" end="00:02:04.758">THAT SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN OFF NOW, BUT YOU GUYS WERE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.758" end="00:02:05.492">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.492" end="00:02:11.064">WHEN THE PRODUCERS FIRST CONTACTED ME BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A CONSULTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.064" end="00:02:12.566">THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A CONSULTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.566" end="00:02:15.302">THEY WERE DOING A REALITY SHOW ABOUT FASHION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.302" end="00:02:17.271">I SAID, A REALITY SHOW ABOUT FASHION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.271" end="00:02:20.307">THIS INDUSTRY HAS ENOUGH TROUBLE WITHOUT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.307" end="00:02:24.244">I FIGURED I&apos;D TAKE SOMEONE OFF THE STREET AT RANDOM AND YOU&apos;RE </p>
<p begin="00:02:24.244" end="00:02:25.479">GOING TO MAKE SOME CLOTHES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.479" end="00:02:30.217">BUT WHEN I HEARD THEY WANTED TO USE REAL FASHION DESIGNERS, I THOUGHT THIS SHOW WILL HAVE A </p>
<p begin="00:02:30.217" end="00:02:33.086">SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE, IT WILL HAVE INTEGRITY AND INDEED IT DOES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.086" end="00:02:37.157">&gt;&gt; HOW DO THEY HOLD UP NOW THAT THEY&apos;VE GONE, THE TENTH SEASON,</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.157" end="00:02:41.828">I ASSUME THAT THE QUALITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU&apos;RE GETTING CONTINUES TO IMPROVE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.828" end="00:02:45.632">HOW DO THEY... DO THEY STILL NOT UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURE OF THE SHOW?</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.632" end="00:02:47.467">DO SOME OF THE PEOPLE LEAVE THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.467" end="00:02:47.801">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.801" end="00:02:49.503">&gt;&gt; WHAT, I HAVE A DAY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.503" end="00:02:49.937">I&apos;M LEAVING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.937" end="00:02:52.406">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S INCONCEIVABLE TO ME,</p>

<p begin="00:02:56.944" end="00:03:00.047">WE THOUGHT THAT, IN FACT...</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.047" end="00:03:02.783">&gt;&gt; Jon: LIKE PRO WRESTLING?</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.783" end="00:03:05.485">&gt;&gt; OH, WE REALLY HAVE A WEEK FOR THESE CHALLENGES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.485" end="00:03:07.087">NO, YOU HAVE A DAY.</p>

<p begin="00:03:18.565" end="00:03:19.967">&gt;&gt; HEIDI IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FAKE.</p>

<p begin="00:03:21.101" end="00:03:22.703">SHE&apos;S BREATHTAKING, ISN&apos;T SHE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.703" end="00:03:24.471">&gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT, YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.471" end="00:03:26.673">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M A VERY LUCKY GUY, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.673" end="00:03:30.711">&gt;&gt; Jon: I WOULD PUT HER ON A MAGAZINE.</p>

<p begin="00:03:38.986" end="00:03:40.220">DO YOU WATCH COOKING SHOWS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.220" end="00:03:46.126">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE REALITY COOKING SHOWS I FIND INTERESTING ALSO, THOUGH AS </p>
<p begin="00:03:46.126" end="00:03:48.629">EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS, YOU CAN&apos;T TASTE IT, YOU CAN&apos;T SMELL IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.629" end="00:03:51.298">YOU HAVE TO RELY ON THE THE JUDGES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.298" end="00:03:54.635">IN THE CASE OF PROJECT RUNWAY,</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.635" end="00:03:57.371">EVERYONE AT HOME CAN BE A JUDGE AND I ASSUME THEY ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.371" end="00:03:59.740">&gt;&gt; Jon: I AM FIERCE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.740" end="00:04:03.610">I DO A LOT OF THIS, YOU WILL NOT PUT THAT OUT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.610" end="00:04:04.077">NO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.077" end="00:04:05.312">NO, NO, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.312" end="00:04:08.081">I GET VERY INVOLVED IN THE WHOLE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.081" end="00:04:10.083">THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE GRADUATED,</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.083" end="00:04:14.054">I&apos;M ALWAYS CURIOUS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THEY DO THIS NOW ON THESE OTHER SHOWS, &quot;AMERICAN </p>
<p begin="00:04:14.054" end="00:04:17.157">IDOL.&quot; THEY BRING BACK THE WINNERS OF YEARS PAST, AND SOME OF THEM </p>
<p begin="00:04:17.157" end="00:04:25.766">HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS CAREERS AND THEN OTHERS ARE NOW LIVING IN A BOX.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.766" end="00:04:34.741">SO WHAT... WHAT HAS BEEN... HAS THE SUCCESS OF THE SHOW TRANSLATED TO PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.741" end="00:04:35.876">&gt;&gt; MY RESPONSE TO THIS QUESTION,</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.876" end="00:04:41.815">AND I RECEIVE IT WITH SOME FREQUENCY IS THE DESIGNERS CAN ONLY WITH AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEIR </p>
<p begin="00:04:41.815" end="00:04:44.284">RESOURCES AND THEIR AMBITIONS ALLOW THEM TO BE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.284" end="00:04:44.785">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.785" end="00:04:48.622">&gt;&gt; AND WE&apos;VE HAD ANY NUMBER OF DESIGNERS WHO HAVE COME FROM </p>

<p begin="00:04:54.428" end="00:04:56.897">THE WINNER OF SEASON TWO, SHE STAYED IN HOUSTON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.897" end="00:04:58.599">SHE TRIPLED HER BUSINESS.</p>

<p begin="00:05:09.576" end="00:05:10.711">PRACTICALLY A HOUSEHOLD NAME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.711" end="00:05:12.513">HE&apos;S A BIG BRAND NOW.</p>

<p begin="00:05:15.449" end="00:05:17.384">AND THAT&apos;S NOT UNUSUAL, AND NO SHAME IN THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.384" end="00:05:18.685">&gt;&gt; NO SHAME AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.685" end="00:05:19.820">ALSO LOOK AT THIS ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.820" end="00:05:23.657">IT&apos;S A REALLY TOUGH TIME TO BE A FLEDGLING FASHION DESIGNER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.657" end="00:05:24.658">IT&apos;S A TOUGH TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.658" end="00:05:26.894">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S A TOUGH TIME REALLY TO BE ANYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.894" end="00:05:28.762">&gt;&gt; ANYTHING, I AGREE WITH YOU.</p>
