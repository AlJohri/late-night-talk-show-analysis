<p begin="00:00:05.439" end="00:00:10.344">NO STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS COMPLETE WITHOUT A FULL PANEL DISCUSSION TO ILLUMINATE AND ANALYZE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.344" end="00:00:12.813">&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT&apos;S SPEECH LAST NIGHT WAS ON POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.813" end="00:00:13.914">&gt;&gt; IT WAS A CAMPAIGN SPEECH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.914" end="00:00:16.316">&gt;&gt; IT WAS A STRONG AND CONFIDENT SPEECH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.316" end="00:00:17.918">&gt;&gt; IT WAS ENTIRELY SAFE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.918" end="00:00:19.253">&gt;&gt; VERY BIPARTISAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.253" end="00:00:19.720">VERY ACCEPTABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.720" end="00:00:21.855">&gt;&gt; I DIDN&apos;T HEAR ANYTHING TOO INSPIRING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.855" end="00:00:23.857">&gt;&gt; I THINK THIS SPEECH IN THE END WAS A BIT BORING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.857" end="00:00:26.460">&gt;&gt; AND I THOUGHT HE REALLY HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:29.763">&gt;&gt; IT WAS GREAT BAD DULL EXCITING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.763" end="00:00:31.365">THAT WAS USELESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.365" end="00:00:35.135">(LAUGHTER) SO PANEL DISCUSSIONS AT THIS POINT ARE ALMOST AS ROTE AS THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:35.135" end="00:00:35.903">PRESIDENT&apos;S SPEECH ITSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.903" end="00:00:42.976">THAT&apos;S WHY OUR OWN (BLEEP)ING TEAM DOESN&apos;T GET BOGGED DOWN IN PEDANTIC PARTISAN ARGUMENTS </p>
<p begin="00:00:42.976" end="00:00:45.312">ABOUT THE WORDS USED OR CONTENT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.312" end="00:00:52.519">(LAUGHTER) (BLEEP)ING TABLE ON TELEVISION ANALYZES THIS YEAR&apos;S STATE OF THE UNION FROM THE ONE </p>
<p begin="00:00:52.519" end="00:01:00.761">PERSPECTIVE WE NEVER HEAR ABOUT-- WITHOUT AUDIO.</p>

<p begin="00:01:06.233" end="00:01:09.903">SAMANTHA BEE, WYATT CENAC, AL MADRIGAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.903" end="00:01:11.772">THEY HAVE ALL WATCHED THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS LAST NIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.772" end="00:01:12.873">&gt;&gt; YES, WE DID.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.873" end="00:01:13.607">&gt;&gt;.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.607" end="00:01:15.809">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND YOU WATCHED IT WITH THE SOUND OFF.</p>

<p begin="00:01:20.180" end="00:01:22.149">LET&apos;S GET YOUR TAKES ON THE SPEECH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.149" end="00:01:23.083">AL MADRIGAL?</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.083" end="00:01:27.654">&gt;&gt; MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS &quot;WHAT THE HELL WAS IN JOE BIDEN&apos;S MOUTH?&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:01:27.654" end="00:01:28.622">LOOK AT HIM WORKING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.622" end="00:01:32.793">IS HE TRYING TO GET PEANUT BUTTER OUT OF HIS GUMS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.793" end="00:01:33.994">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S HOW THEY GET HORSES TO TALK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.994" end="00:01:35.295">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT WAS A PUBIC HAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.295" end="00:01:37.264">I HATE THAT SO MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.264" end="00:01:40.367">&gt;&gt; WELL, PUBIC HAIRS THEY STICK TO PEANUT BUTTER, RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.367" end="00:01:42.102">&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, THEY DO.</p>

<p begin="00:01:42.803" end="00:01:44.438">I KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.438" end="00:01:44.838">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.838" end="00:01:49.877">&gt;&gt; Jon: I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY JUST LIKE A LOZENGE OF SOME SORT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.877" end="00:01:54.648">&gt;&gt; SOMETHING HE CAN CHEW ON SO HE DOESN&apos;T SHOUT OUT &quot;MOTHER </p>
<p begin="00:01:54.648" end="00:01:55.983">(BLEEP)ER&quot; FOR NO REASON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.983" end="00:01:56.350">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:56.350" end="00:02:00.387">&gt;&gt; NOT THAT YOU COULD BLAME HIM BECAUSE THAT ROOM IS FULL OF MOTHER (BLEEP)ERS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.387" end="00:02:01.054">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.054" end="00:02:01.855">DID ANYTHING STRIKE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.855" end="00:02:07.194">&gt;&gt; YEAH, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT MONSTER PLANT ON THAT LADY&apos;S JACKET?</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.194" end="00:02:08.862">I THINK IT&apos;S THE TOP OF HER HEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.862" end="00:02:12.633">&gt;&gt; I CAN&apos;T BELIEVE THAT THING DIDN&apos;T SHOUT &quot;FEED ME SEYMOUR.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:02:12.633" end="00:02:17.070">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S LIKE A PLANT THAT CAN BITE YOUR HEAD OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.070" end="00:02:19.206">&gt;&gt; YES!</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.206" end="00:02:24.611">&gt;&gt; JON, I&apos;D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE A MOMENT OF TRUE TRANSCENDENCE CAPTURED BY THE CAMERAS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.611" end="00:02:25.345">&gt;&gt; Jon: SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.345" end="00:02:30.150">&gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF GAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA HIS HEAVENLY BLESSINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.150" end="00:02:32.719">THAT IS QUITE THE ENDORSEMENT IN AN ELECTION YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.719" end="00:02:33.187">&gt;&gt; Jon: SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.187" end="00:02:35.923">&gt;&gt; AND A BIG (BLEEP) YOU TO MITT ROMNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.923" end="00:02:37.124">&gt;&gt; Jon: BIG.</p>

<p begin="00:02:37.491" end="00:02:39.960">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M SORRY, WHO?</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.960" end="00:02:45.098">&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT, DID ANY OF YOU CATCH THE REPUBLICAN REBUTTAL BY MITCH DANIELS OF INDIANA?</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.098" end="00:02:46.166">&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOD!</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.166" end="00:02:47.668">IS THAT WHO THAT WAS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.668" end="00:02:48.335">&gt;&gt; Jon: UH-HUH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.335" end="00:02:52.239">&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GHOST OF CALVIN COOLIDGE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:53.574">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:53.574" end="00:02:54.942">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIDICULOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.942" end="00:03:03.517">THE REPUBLICAN REBUTTAL WAS CLEARLY A SURREALIST HOMAGE TO &quot;EGG BALANCE ON TOP OF A HAT.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.517" end="00:03:06.620">&gt;&gt; Jon: I GOT MORE OF A &quot;BENJAMIN BUTTON&quot; VIBE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.620" end="00:03:09.790">JUST A COUPLE MINUTES BEFORE HE GETS SUPER HANDSOME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.790" end="00:03:10.123">ANYBODY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.123" end="00:03:13.894">&gt;&gt; SORRY, JON, PLEASE, IF WE&apos;RE GOING WITH MOVIES THIS IS </p>
<p begin="00:03:13.894" end="00:03:20.534">OBVIOUSLY &quot;ALBERT NOBBS.&quot; IT&apos;S GLENN CLOSE DRESSED LIKE A VICTORIAN GENTLEMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.534" end="00:03:21.201">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T SEE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.201" end="00:03:22.302">&gt;&gt; WAIT FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.302" end="00:03:23.337">WAIT FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.337" end="00:03:23.637">OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.637" end="00:03:25.205">&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.205" end="00:03:25.506">SNOO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.506" end="00:03:30.410">&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT THAT GUY LOOKED LIKE ONE OF THOSE SPOOKY PORTRAITS IN A SCOOBY DO HAUNTED </p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:36.216">HOUSE WITH THE EYES THAT FOLLOW YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.216" end="00:03:36.550">RUH-ROH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.550" end="00:03:37.184">&gt;&gt; Jon: I GET THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.184" end="00:03:39.987">WELL, LISTEN GUYS THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANALYSIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.987" end="00:03:41.822">THIS MET ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.822" end="00:03:44.558">I THINK FROM NOW ON PANELS SHOULDN&apos;T WATCH THESE SPEECHES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.558" end="00:03:45.325">&gt;&gt; I AGREE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.325" end="00:03:47.160">&gt;&gt; WELL DONE.</p>
