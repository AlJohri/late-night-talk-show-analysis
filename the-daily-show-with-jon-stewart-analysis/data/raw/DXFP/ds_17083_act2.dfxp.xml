<p begin="00:00:09.810" end="00:00:18.752">SOCIAL MEDIA, THE PHRASE ABOUT A THING, PEOPLE EVERYWHERE ARE TALKING ABOUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.752" end="00:00:22.022">AND IT&apos;S SOMETHING OUR PRESIDENT IS KNOWN TO EXCEL AT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.022" end="00:00:28.061">&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS THE RINGLEADER WHEN IT CAME TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND ENGAGING </p>
<p begin="00:00:28.061" end="00:00:30.464">THOSE YOUNG VOTERS, IS HE STILL THE KING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.464" end="00:00:33.500">&gt;&gt; MR. OBAMA PIONEERED THE PRESIDENT&apos;S USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.500" end="00:00:36.570">&gt;&gt; OBAMA DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN USED SOCIAL MEDIA VERY, VERY WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.570" end="00:00:37.971">THEY RAISED A LOT OF MONEY ON-LINE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.971" end="00:00:39.806">&gt;&gt; HE IS OUR FIRST SOCIAL MEDIA PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.806" end="00:00:42.009">HE HAS CONNECTED WITH SUPPORTERS ON FACEBOOK,</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.009" end="00:00:45.445">TWITTER AND TUMBLER AND IS NOW ON INSTAGRAM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.445" end="00:00:46.513">&gt;&gt; Jon: WOW, OH MY GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.513" end="00:00:48.148">HE WASTES A LOT OF TIME ON </p>
<p begin="00:00:48.148" end="00:00:48.515">[BLEEP].</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.515" end="00:00:53.921">(LAUGHTER) MR. PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIANS ARE ON THE LINE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.921" end="00:00:58.759">&gt;&gt; SH, I&apos;M A CHECK IN AWAY FROM BEING THE MAYOR OF WHITE HOUSE ON FOUR SQUARE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.759" end="00:01:03.864">AND THEN IT&apos;S ON TO THE CINNAMON CHALLENGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.864" end="00:01:05.232">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:05.232" end="00:01:07.701">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DIDN&apos;T KNOW WHAT IT WAS EITHER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.701" end="00:01:09.703">DON&apos;T-- ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.703" end="00:01:12.439">THIS PRESIDENT IS 1/10 LEVEL TECHNO E WIZARD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.439" end="00:01:15.843">AND THAT IS WHY ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND ANY LIKE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE I </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.843" end="00:01:18.245">WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO THE PRESIDENT, STOP IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.245" end="00:01:24.384">(LAUGHTER) OR IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY, I ASK ONLY THAT YOU NOT HAVE TO TAKE ON </p>
<p begin="00:01:24.384" end="00:01:29.122">THE PERSONA OF THE MEDIAN AGE OF THE TECHNOLOGY&apos;S OTHER USERS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.122" end="00:01:32.259">FOR INSTANCE, I RECEIVED SOME OF YOUR CAMPAIGN E-MAILS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.259" end="00:01:34.628">I HAPPEN TO GET E-MAILS FROM ALL THE CAMPAIGNS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.628" end="00:01:47.541">AND THE ONES FROM BARACK OBAMA HAVE THE SUBJECT LINE &quot;HEY, THIS IS WRONG&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:01:47.541" end="00:01:50.611">YOU DON&apos;T NEED TO ADDRESS ANYONE AS &quot;HEY&quot; TO BE COOL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.611" end="00:01:51.979">YOU&apos;RE THE PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.979" end="00:01:53.947">THAT&apos;S PRETTY [BLEEP] COOL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.947" end="00:01:58.118">WHEN AN E-MAIL IS FROM YOU THE SUBJECT LINE SHOULD PRETTY MUCH JUST BE &quot;FROM </p>
<p begin="00:01:58.118" end="00:02:01.522">THE PRESIDENT&quot; ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.522" end="00:02:04.758">YOU DON&apos;T NEED TO RESORT TO THE KINDS OF FAKE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.758" end="00:02:11.198">FAMILIARITY THAT IS LIKE SPAMERS USE TO GET ME TO BUY AN iPHONE 6.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.198" end="00:02:13.367">IT&apos;S NOT A REAL iPHONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.367" end="00:02:20.707">AND SECOND, EVERY TIME I OPEN THOSE SUPERCASUAL BRO-MAILS, THE MESSAGE IS ALWAYS THE SAME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.707" end="00:02:23.777">GIVE ME MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.777" end="00:02:25.479">EVERY TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.479" end="00:02:30.851">IT&apos;S LIKE YOU DON&apos;T EVEN REALLY VALUE OUR MAKE BELIEVE FRIENDSHIP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.851" end="00:02:37.457">SERIOUSLY THERE ARE EXILED NIGERIAN PRINCES GETTING OBAMA CAMPAIGN E-MAILS GOING,</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.457" end="00:02:39.126">EASE UP ON THE MONEY THING,</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.126" end="00:02:39.893">FELLOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.893" end="00:02:45.732">BUT GETTING DOZENS OF HOW IS IT HANGING FROM YOU IS RUINING MY ACTUAL FRIENDSHIP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.732" end="00:02:49.770">NOW WHEN ANYONE E-MAILS ME JUST TO SAY &quot;HEY&quot; I&apos;VE BEEN </p>
<p begin="00:02:49.770" end="00:02:56.944">TRAINED PAVLOV&apos;S DOG STYLE TO ASSUME THAT THEY&apos;RE REALLY JUST ASKING ME FOR $75.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.944" end="00:02:59.646">DENNIS LEARY TELLS ME SUBJECT LINE GO [BLEEP]</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.646" end="00:03:06.453">MYSELF, I WON&apos;T KNOW IF HE REALLY MEANS IT, EVEN WHEN HE TELLS ME REALLY MEANS IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.453" end="00:03:11.625">(LAUGHTER) STILL GOING TO BE THINKING SOME WITH IN THERE HE&apos;S JUST LOOKING FOR $75 BUCKS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.625" end="00:03:15.362">MY POINT IS I WOULD MIND IT LESS IF YOUR CAMPAIGN SOLICITATION E-MAILS WERE </p>
<p begin="00:03:15.362" end="00:03:18.065">SUBJECT LINE GIVE ME MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.065" end="00:03:21.401">THEN I WOULD KNOW THE PARAMETERS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.401" end="00:03:25.506">HERE&apos;S ANOTHER ONE.&quot; DINNER?</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.506" end="00:03:27.541">&quot;AND&quot; JOHN?</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.541" end="00:03:30.410">&quot;CAN WE MEET FOR DIFFERENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:30.944">OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.944" end="00:03:33.647">I WILL MAKE A COUPLE OF BURGERS, IT WILL BE ALL GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.647" end="00:03:38.752">THEN A FEW DAYS LATER IT&apos;S I&apos;M BRINGING MICHELLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.752" end="00:03:43.524">AND I&apos;M LIKE OH, GREAT, NOW THEY HAVE TO BE GRASS FED LOCALLY SOURCED BURGERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.524" end="00:03:47.694">AND NOW THAT THERE ARE THREE OF US THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE SLIDERS BECAUSE I </p>
<p begin="00:03:47.694" end="00:03:49.296">DON&apos;T HAVE ENOUGH BURGER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.296" end="00:03:52.499">MEANWHILE THE PRESIDENT AND I ARE DEVELOPING OUR RELATIONSHIP HIS WIFE IS </p>
<p begin="00:03:52.499" end="00:03:55.102">E-MAILING ME ON THE DL, ME AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.102" end="00:03:59.640">AND I LOVE YOU BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.640" end="00:04:02.709">LADY, YOUR HUSBAND&apos;S GOING TO BE HERE IN LIKE AN HOUR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.709" end="00:04:05.078">AND THEN COMES THE KICKER,</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.078" end="00:04:07.714">ME, BARAK AND YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.714" end="00:04:09.783">NO!</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.783" end="00:04:11.218">OKAY!</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.218" end="00:04:12.920">BUT WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH SOME GROUND RULES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.920" end="00:04:17.758">FIRST OF ALL, DON&apos;T POST ANY OF THESE PICTURES ON WHAT WAS THAT INSTA-GRAM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.758" end="00:04:18.091">HMMMM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.091" end="00:04:22.863">I WILL SAY I ONCE DID RECEIVE ONE OF THESE CASUALLY SUBJECTED POLITICAL E-MAILS THAT I DID ENJOY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.863" end="00:04:24.631">IT CAME FROM A DIFFERENT CAMPAIGN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.631" end="00:04:27.367">WE SIGN UP FOR ALL OF THEM SO WE CAN PRETEND WE&apos;RE POPULAR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.367" end="00:04:35.175">THIS ONE CAME FROM MARCUS BACHMANN, THE FAMOUSLY FLAMBOYANT RUNNER OF THE CLINICS AND MICHELE </p>
<p begin="00:04:35.175" end="00:04:37.211">BACHMANN&apos;S HUSBAND, THE SUBJECT LINE OF THE E-MAIL,</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.211" end="00:04:42.816">I SWEAR TO YOU,&quot; SHH, DON&apos;T TELL MICHELE &quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.816" end="00:04:44.418">THAT IS AN INTRIGUING E-MAIL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.418" end="00:04:49.957">I DIDN&apos;T CLICK ON IT BUT ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS DON&apos;T WORRY GIRLFRIEND, SHE ALREADY KNOWS.</p>
