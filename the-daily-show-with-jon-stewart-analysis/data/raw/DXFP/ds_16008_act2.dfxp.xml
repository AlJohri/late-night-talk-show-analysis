<p begin="00:00:04.638" end="00:00:07.975">IT SEEMS AT A ONCE PROUD AMERICAN SPORT IS IN TROUBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.975" end="00:00:12.913">&gt;&gt; NASCAR HAS STRUGGLED IN RECENT YEARS HURT BY THE EFFECTS OF THE RECESSION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.913" end="00:00:16.984">&gt;&gt; THE SPORT IS IN A FIGHT FOR SPONSOR DOLLARS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.984" end="00:00:20.821">&gt;&gt; NASCAR&apos;S RATING 10% DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.821" end="00:00:23.123">&gt;&gt; SOME SAY I&apos;VE GOTTEN STALE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.123" end="00:00:28.762">&gt;&gt; HOW COULD PEOPLE GET BORED WATCHING SOMEONE DRIVE IN A CIRCLE AGAIN AND AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.762" end="00:00:35.402">&gt;&gt; Jon: LUCKILY HERE TO LEND HIS EXPERTISE IS JOHN HODGMAN IN </p>
<p begin="00:00:35.402" end="00:00:38.105">HIS SEGMENT:  YOU&apos;RE WELCOME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.105" end="00:00:44.077">&#x266A; &#x266A; </p>
<p begin="00:00:44.378" end="00:00:49.883">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE JOHN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.883" end="00:00:51.118">[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.118" end="00:00:51.685">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.685" end="00:00:52.286">I LIKE THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.286" end="00:00:53.153">I LIKE THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.153" end="00:01:01.762">IS THAT A MUSTACHE IN HONOR OF YOUR BUSHY DALE EARNHARDT STASCHE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.762" end="00:01:03.430">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.430" end="00:01:05.566">I FORGOT I HAD THIS ON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.566" end="00:01:06.900">IT&apos;S FOR A MOVIE PART.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.900" end="00:01:09.036">LET ME GET RID OF IT FOR YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.036" end="00:01:09.636">THERE WE GO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.636" end="00:01:12.673">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID YOU GROW A MUSTACHE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.673" end="00:01:18.045">&gt;&gt; I WAS GOING FOR STANLEY TUCCI IN THE LOVELY BONES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.045" end="00:01:21.081">YOU KNOW, SOPHISTICATED,</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.081" end="00:01:21.582">FRIENDLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.582" end="00:01:21.949">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.949" end="00:01:26.453">&gt;&gt; Jon: WAS TUCCI&apos;S CHARACTER A -- </p>
<p begin="00:01:26.453" end="00:01:28.455">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T KNOW I DIDN&apos;T SEE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.455" end="00:01:28.856">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.856" end="00:01:31.024">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET&apos;S GET TO THE MATTER AT HAND HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.024" end="00:01:32.693">&gt;&gt; SURE, NASCAR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.693" end="00:01:33.560">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.560" end="00:01:36.396">&gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM IS THEY HAVE LOST TOUCH WITH THE HERITAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.396" end="00:01:39.132">TODAY&apos;S DRIVERS ARE ALL MILLIONAIRES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.132" end="00:01:48.008">THE CARS THEY DRIVE IN ARE SPACE AGE SAFETY���i CAGES WITH WHEEL AND THE TRACKS THEY DRIVE ON ARE </p>
<p begin="00:01:48.008" end="00:01:51.945">GOLD AND SPRAY PAINTED TO LOOK LIKE ASPHALT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.945" end="00:01:54.281">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT SOUND AS MAZING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.281" end="00:01:54.882">DO THEY HAVE THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.882" end="00:01:57.651">&gt;&gt; YOU WOULD THINK SO BUT IT&apos;S BORING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.651" end="00:02:00.420">NOT EVEN WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:02.055">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.055" end="00:02:04.525">COST COSTS $5 MILLION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.525" end="00:02:08.996">THAT&apos;S WHY NASCAR IS ECLIPSED BY DOWN AND DIRTY SPORTS LIKE CAGE </p>
<p begin="00:02:08.996" end="00:02:12.165">FIGHTING WHICH BRINGS ME TO THAT FIRST SOLUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.165" end="00:02:16.937">LOSE THE BORING OVAL TRACK AND REPLACE IT WITH THE SHAPE PEOPLE LOVE THE OCTOBER GONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.937" end="00:02:26.446">&gt;&gt; Jon: OBVIOUSLY THE INTEARAL ANGLE OF AN OCTOBER GONE IS 1358 </p>
<p begin="00:02:26.446" end="00:02:28.248">DEGREES I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW A DRIVER -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:28.248" end="00:02:35.155">&gt;&gt; WAIT A MINUTE, HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE EXACT INTERIOR ANGLE AN OCTOBER GONE IS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.155" end="00:02:37.391">HAND IT OVER, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.391" end="00:02:38.759">A PROTRACTOR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.759" end="00:02:39.726">I THOUGHT SO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.726" end="00:02:40.194">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.194" end="00:02:42.496">THAT&apos;S MY JOB.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.496" end="00:02:44.865">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.865" end="00:02:52.840">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU CAN&apos;T JUST CHANGE THE SHAPE OF TRACK AND STEAL BACK VIEWERS FROM ULTIMATE FIGHTING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.840" end="00:02:57.244">&gt;&gt; OF COURSE NOT THAT&apos;S WHY THEY MUST ENACT THE SECOND|� SOLUTION NO MORE CARS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.244" end="00:03:01.114">&gt;&gt; Jon: A GIANT FOOT RACE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.114" end="00:03:02.850">&gt;&gt; MORE LIKE A FIST RACE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.850" end="00:03:09.590">AS SOON AS THE FLAG GOES DOWN THE DRIVERS PUNCH EACH OTHER IN A CAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.590" end="00:03:15.329">&gt;&gt; Jon: I KNOW CAGE FIGHTING IS POPULAR WITHOUT CHANGING IT TO BE CAGE FIGHTING?</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.329" end="00:03:16.230">&gt;&gt; WHY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.230" end="00:03:19.433">IT COULD BE BACK TO ITS ROOTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.433" end="00:03:26.139">STOCK CAR RACING STARTED OUT WITH BOOT LEGGERS OUTRUNNING THE POLICE DURING PROHIBITION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.139" end="00:03:30.110">&gt;&gt; Jon: RUGBY STARTED WITH PEOPLE FIGHTING OVER A HAM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.110" end="00:03:31.512">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T KNOW ABOUT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.512" end="00:03:37.518">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DOES NASCAR RECAPTURE THE EXCITEMENT AND DANGER OF THOSE RUM-RUNNING DAYS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.518" end="00:03:43.257">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S SIMPLE:  AFTER EACH RACE THE LOSER IS HANDCUFFED TO HIS </p>
<p begin="00:03:43.257" end="00:03:47.227">OWN BUMPER AND BEATEN TO DEATH BY A CORRUPT SOUTHERN SHERIFF.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.227" end="00:03:51.331">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOUR SOLUTION IS TO FORCE THE DRIVERS TO SUFFER PAIN?</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.331" end="00:03:53.800">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S NASCAR&apos;S SOLUTION,</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.800" end="00:03:54.268">WATCH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.268" end="00:03:56.103">&gt;&gt; THEY LOOSENED THE RULES THIS YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.103" end="00:04:01.008">&gt;&gt; OFFICIALS WANT DRIVERS TO MIX IT UP, SAYING HAVE AT IT, BOYS </p>
<p begin="00:04:01.008" end="00:04:03.210">THE HISTORY IS BASED ON BANG RIG FENDER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.210" end="00:04:06.880">THEY ARE GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO INTENTIONALLY WRECK PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.880" end="00:04:07.681">&gt;&gt; ALLOW PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.681" end="00:04:09.850">THAT MEANS NOT HITTING PEOPLE IS AN OPTION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.850" end="00:04:10.751">THAT WILL NEVER WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.751" end="00:04:12.519">&gt;&gt; Jon: THERE&apos;S A MIDDLE GROUND?</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.519" end="00:04:17.958">&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN MY SOLUTION AS AN EXCITING SPORT WHICH PEOPLE WANT </p>
<p begin="00:04:17.958" end="00:04:22.229">TO WATCH WITH NASCAR INSISTING ON CARS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.229" end="00:04:24.831">ANSWER IS STARING US IN THE FACE:  MAKE THE A DEATH RACE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.831" end="00:04:36.877">IN THE YEAR 2011 WHEN THE CRASHES ARE MANDATORY AND THE NAVIGATORS MUST HAVE GLASSES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.877" end="00:04:38.812">I CAN&apos;T BELIEVE IT WAS 11 YEARS AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.812" end="00:04:40.948">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S 40 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.948" end="00:04:48.322">IT WAS DAVID CARRADYNE IN DEATH RACE 2000.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.322" end="00:04:50.858">&gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKED THAT MOVIE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.858" end="00:04:51.925">A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.925" end="00:04:54.328">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY DIDN&apos;T ACTUALLY HUGE BOMB.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.328" end="00:04:56.797">&gt;&gt; AT LEAST ONE PERSON WATCHED IT.</p>
