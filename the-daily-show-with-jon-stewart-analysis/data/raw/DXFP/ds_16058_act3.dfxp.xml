<p begin="00:00:27.094" end="00:00:32.833">I WAS CONTAGIOUS WITH THE BU BONS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.833" end="00:00:36.670">YOU AND YOUR STAFF WERE VERY KIND WITH SLIPPERS AND GINGER ALE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.670" end="00:00:37.704">I WAS VERY APPRECIATIVE.</p>

<p begin="00:01:42.736" end="00:01:46.206">AND THEN THE BOSS CALLS AND SAYS, RUN TO THE STUDIO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.206" end="00:01:47.875">SO IT&apos;S VERY... IT&apos;S EXCITING.</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.125" end="00:02:11.265">THIS IS ONE OF THOSE STORIES THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MESS UP UNLESS YOU TRY TO GET OUT AHEAD OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.265" end="00:02:16.069">ESSENTIALLY OUR JOB RIGHT NOW IS TO GIVE THE INFORMATION, GIVE THE INFORMATION TO AN AMERICAN </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.069" end="00:02:18.105">PUBLIC THAT IS INCREDIBLY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.105" end="00:02:21.909">INCREDIBLY HUNGRY TO HEAR IT IN GREAT DETAIL BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU&apos;RE NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE </p>
<p begin="00:02:21.909" end="00:02:25.679">OUT THERE SINGING IN THE STREETS ABOUT THIS, WE&apos;RE ALL HAVING AN </p>
<p begin="00:02:25.679" end="00:02:27.114">EMOTIONALLY CATHARTIC REACTION TO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.114" end="00:02:28.348">&gt;&gt; Jon: VERY VISCERAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.348" end="00:02:33.220">&gt;&gt; AND I THINK WE JUST NEED TO... I THINK WE NEED TO BE HUMBLE AND NOT GET TOO FAR AHEAD </p>
<p begin="00:02:33.220" end="00:02:37.424">OF THE FACTS, NOT GET IDEOLOGICAL ABOUT IT AND JUST LET PEOPLE UNDERSTAND AS MUCH AS </p>

<p begin="00:02:38.125" end="00:02:39.259">IT&apos;S SUCH A BIG DEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.259" end="00:02:40.827">I CAN&apos;T BELIEVE IT TOOK TEN YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.827" end="00:02:45.232">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT&apos;S SO GREAT IS WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT REALLY DID LAST FOR OVER I THINK </p>
<p begin="00:02:45.232" end="00:02:49.336">LIKE 47 MINUTES AS I WATCHED THE NEWS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.336" end="00:02:50.204">DIDN&apos;T YOU NOTICE THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.204" end="00:02:53.340">IT WAS LIKE THAT FIRST NIGHT EVERYBODY WAS IN THAT MODE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.340" end="00:02:57.010">THE NEXT NIGHT IT&apos;S LIKE, WHAT DO YOU THINK FOR OBAMA&apos;S POLL NUMBERS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.010" end="00:03:03.083">IT ALL OF A SUDDEN DEVOLVED BACK INTO THE REGULAR SORT OF CATEGORIES THAT THE NEWS HAS TO </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.083" end="00:03:05.352">PLACE THINGS IN AS THEY GO ALONG.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.352" end="00:03:11.325">&gt;&gt; BUT, YOU KNOW, I ALSO THINK THIS IS A TIME WHEN THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU EITHER </p>
<p begin="00:03:11.325" end="00:03:14.228">PROVED YOURSELF AS A JERK OR YOU PROVED YOURSELF NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.228" end="00:03:18.699">IF YOU CAN RESIST THAT TEMPTATION, I HONESTLY THINK THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN TRYING THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:18.699" end="00:03:19.666">LEAD EVEN THE MEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.666" end="00:03:22.503">THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN TRYING THE SAY, THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR UNITY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.503" end="00:03:24.605">THIS IS NOT A TIME TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.605" end="00:03:27.674">THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR RECRIMINATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.674" end="00:03:29.109">LET&apos;S CONGRATULATE THE PEOPLE WHO DID IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.109" end="00:03:33.680">THERE IS A NEWS EQUIVALENT TO THAT WHICH IS STAYING CLOSE TO THE FACTS AND NOT TRYING TO MAKE </p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:36.917">THIS HELP YOU SCORE WHATEVER POLITICAL POINT YOU WANT TO MAKE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.917" end="00:03:38.986">THERE&apos;S PLENTY OF TIME TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.986" end="00:03:40.654">OSAMA BIN LADEN WILL BE DEAD FOREVER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.654" end="00:03:43.757">OSAMA BIN LADEN IS NEVER COMING BACK.</p>

<p begin="00:03:46.360" end="00:03:50.197">&gt;&gt; Jon: VERY QUICKLY, CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.197" end="00:03:51.098">BECAUSE...</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.098" end="00:03:52.232">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.232" end="00:04:00.908">AS WE SAW, BUT IMMEDIATELY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE REALITY THAT YOU LIVE INCH I </p>
<p begin="00:04:00.908" end="00:04:03.443">TURN ON THE NEWS AND IMMEDIATELY YOU DO HAVE PEOPLE SAYING, WELL,</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.443" end="00:04:05.078">IS HE DEAD?</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.078" end="00:04:10.551">IT&apos;S AWFULLY WEIRD THAT... DO YOU THINK THEY DID IT TO DISTRACT FROM THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.551" end="00:04:10.918">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.918" end="00:04:12.920">AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF,</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.920" end="00:04:13.253">REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.253" end="00:04:14.755">THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S LIVING IN YOUR HEAD?</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.755" end="00:04:18.192">IS THAT... ARE YOU THAT JUST INSANE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.192" end="00:04:22.362">&gt;&gt; THE IDEA THAT THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS THE REAL STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.362" end="00:04:22.930">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.930" end="00:04:26.700">&gt;&gt; AND OSAMA BIN LADEN IS THE DISTRACTION FROM IT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW </p>
<p begin="00:04:26.700" end="00:04:30.504">ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY INVESTED IN THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.504" end="00:04:38.579">IF YOU THINK THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN IS THE DISTRACTION THAT AMERICA NEEDS, I THINK THAT PUTS </p>
<p begin="00:04:38.579" end="00:04:40.414">THAT IN THE PROPER PERSPECTIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.414" end="00:04:44.351">THE WHOLE LIKE IF WE DON&apos;T SEE THE PICTURES, NONE OF US WILL </p>
<p begin="00:04:44.351" end="00:04:47.187">EVER BELIEVE HE&apos;S DEAD THING IS A COUNTRY THAT I DON&apos;T RECOGNIZE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.187" end="00:04:49.990">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND IF THEY SHOW THE PICTURES, THEY&apos;LL GO, YOU SEE </p>
<p begin="00:04:49.990" end="00:04:51.725">THIS SHADOW, IT&apos;S PHOTOSHOPPED IN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.725" end="00:04:53.627">YOU CAN TELL THAT IT DOESN&apos;T REALLY DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.627" end="00:04:59.099">DID THEY TELL YOU GUYS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT MADE HIS SPEECH WHAT HAD HAPPENED?</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.099" end="00:05:00.300">DID EVERYONE KNOW?</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.300" end="00:05:05.539">&gt;&gt; WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO ANNOUNCE, BUT NOT THAT FAR OUT </p>
<p begin="00:05:05.539" end="00:05:06.373">IN ADVANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.373" end="00:05:11.211">I MEAN, NOT... NOBODY HAD ADVANCED PLANNING NOTES FOR SUNDAY NIGHT SOMETHING&apos;S GOING </p>
<p begin="00:05:11.211" end="00:05:11.745">TO HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.745" end="00:05:13.180">IT WASN&apos;T LIKE THAT AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.180" end="00:05:16.550">BUT ONCE IT WAS CLEAR THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT, THEN PEOPLE </p>
<p begin="00:05:16.550" end="00:05:19.219">STARTED GETTING WORD ABOUT WHAT THE GENERAL CONTENT OF THAT WOULD BE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.219" end="00:05:26.260">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT WAS FUNNY TO WATCH PEOPLE BE SO COY, BECAUSE YOU KNEW THEY KNEW, AND SO THEY WERE </p>
<p begin="00:05:26.260" end="00:05:30.697">... I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT&apos;S... IT&apos;S C.I.A.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.697" end="00:05:36.870">IT INVOLVES A VERY SKINNY MAN, A SKINNY MAN, MAN THAT YOU MIGHT THINK HAS RICKETTS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.870" end="00:05:38.505">YOU WOULDN&apos;T KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.505" end="00:05:40.274">LIKE THEY WERE TRYING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.274" end="00:05:41.375">HOW DO YOU WALK THAT LINE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.375" end="00:05:45.879">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S THE SAME WAY THAT YOU DEAL WITH AN EMBARGO SPEECH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.879" end="00:05:48.849">SOMETIMES A COUPLE MINUTES BEFORE THE PRESIDENT OR SOMEBODY ELSE VERY IMPORTANT IS GOING TO </p>
<p begin="00:05:48.849" end="00:05:58.859">GIVE A SPEECH, YOU GET THE FULL TEXT, AND THEN YOU GET ALL THESE PUNDITS SAY, WHAT WE OUGHT TO </p>
<p begin="00:05:58.859" end="00:06:02.829">EXPECT... YOU&apos;RE SAYING, YOU&apos;RE A SPEED READER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.829" end="00:06:07.134">I CAN SEE YOU SKIPPING AHEAD TO PREDICT THE THING THAT YOU KNOW IS GOING TO HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.134" end="00:06:08.836">PEOPLE LIE ABOUT THAT STUFF ALL THE TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.836" end="00:06:12.940">&gt;&gt; SUDDENLY I FELT LIKE I WAS THE STUDENT WHO GOT TO HANG AROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.940" end="00:06:15.542">LIKE WHAT DO THEY DO WHEN THAT HAPPENS?</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.542" end="00:06:17.511">YOU GET THE SPEECH BEFOREHAND.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.511" end="00:06:19.112">&gt;&gt; REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.112" end="00:06:21.114">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, YOU CONTINUE TO DO AN EXCELLENT JOB.</p>
