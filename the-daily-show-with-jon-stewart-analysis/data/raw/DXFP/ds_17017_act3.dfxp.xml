<p begin="00:01:19.279" end="00:01:21.915">&gt;&gt; Jon: VERY ENTHUSIASTIC.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.915" end="00:01:22.850">IT&apos;S JUST INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.850" end="00:01:24.318">I&apos;VE BEEN HERE 12 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.318" end="00:01:34.228">I&apos;VE JUST NEVER SEEN SUCH A WARM... IT WAS NICE TO SEE THEM CAPABLE OF SUCH LOVE AND GRATITUDE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.228" end="00:01:35.495">&gt;&gt; THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.495" end="00:01:36.597">I CAN TELL THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.597" end="00:01:38.265">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY REALLY ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.265" end="00:01:44.104">I&apos;M GOING TO TELL YOU MY FAVORITE MOMENT OF THIS MOVIE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.104" end="00:01:46.773">NOT GIVING AWAY TREMENDOUS...</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.773" end="00:01:50.577">BUT IT&apos;S A DETAIL THAT I LOVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.577" end="00:01:55.382">HOOVER IS IN BOBBY KENNEDY&apos;S OFFICE, AND HE&apos;S TALKING ABOUT </p>
<p begin="00:01:55.382" end="00:02:02.189">HOW HE GOT A TAPE OF J.F.K. IN A DELICATE SITUATION WITH A WOMAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.189" end="00:02:06.093">BUT HE&apos;S REALLY INTERESTED IN ROBERT KENNEDY&apos;S FIREPLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.093" end="00:02:07.127">DO YOU REMEMBER THE SCENE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.127" end="00:02:08.161">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.161" end="00:02:13.467">&gt;&gt; Jon: LATER ON IN THE MOVIE HE&apos;S INFORMING ROBERT KENNEDY </p>
<p begin="00:02:13.467" end="00:02:18.071">OF THE ASSASSINATION STANDING IN FRONT OF THE SAME FIREPLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.071" end="00:02:23.277">BECAUSE HE ADMIRED ROBERT KENNEDY&apos;S FIREPLACE HE ACTUALLY BOUGHT AND BUILT ONE </p>
<p begin="00:02:23.277" end="00:02:24.945">FOR HIMSELF IN HIS OFFICE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.945" end="00:02:25.379">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.379" end="00:02:28.215">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW CRAZY IS THAT GUY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.215" end="00:02:30.918">&gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE GET OBSESSED BY LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.918" end="00:02:33.787">I GUESS HE WAS... HE THOUGHT,</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.787" end="00:02:36.657">WHY SHOULD HE HAVE SOMETHING I DON&apos;T HAVE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.657" end="00:02:41.295">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT WAS SUCH A NICE MOMENT BECAUSE YOU DON&apos;T REALLY POINT IT OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.295" end="00:02:45.732">IT&apos;S AT THIS VERY DRAMATIC MOMENT BUT THE WHOLE TIME I&apos;M </p>
<p begin="00:02:45.732" end="00:02:48.135">GOING HE&apos;S GOT BOBBY KENNEDY&apos;S FIREPLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.135" end="00:02:50.571">&gt;&gt; YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A MISTAKE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.571" end="00:02:53.574">WE JUST USED THE WRONG SET.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.574" end="00:02:58.011">&gt;&gt; Jon: I THOUGHT WHY IS HE STANDING IN BOBBY KENNEDY&apos;S OFFICE TELLING HIM ABOUT...</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.011" end="00:03:00.314">AND THEN I REALIZED HE&apos;S PSYCHO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.314" end="00:03:01.748">&gt;&gt; WELL, HE COULD HAVE BEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.748" end="00:03:07.154">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU THINK SUCH AN INTERESTING PERSONALITY PORTRAYAL, WHAT DO YOU THINK </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.154" end="00:03:12.059">OF HOOVER AND HIS INTENTIONS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.059" end="00:03:16.296">WAS HE, YOU KNOW, OBSESSED WITH LAW AND ORDER BECAUSE HE WAS OBSESSED WITH TRYING TO </p>
<p begin="00:03:16.296" end="00:03:17.931">CONTROL HIMSELF DO YOU THINK?</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.931" end="00:03:19.066">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M NOT SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.066" end="00:03:21.535">HE IS A MYSTERY GUY AS FAR AS I&apos;M CONCERNED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.535" end="00:03:30.143">I GREW UP HEARING HIM ON THE RADIO AND READING ABOUT IT IN THE PAPER BUT VERY LITTLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.143" end="00:03:32.079">IT WAS A NON-INFORMATION AGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.079" end="00:03:35.349">HOOVER WAS ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS THE HEAD COP, HEAD G-MAN,</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.349" end="00:03:37.351">ALL THAT SORT OF THING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.351" end="00:03:39.987">BUT NOBODY EVER REALLY KNEW ABOUT HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.987" end="00:03:42.189">GREAT RUMORS WOULD COME OUT ABOUT HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.189" end="00:03:45.192">BUT HE WAS JUST VERY SECRETIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.192" end="00:03:51.899">I GUESS HE KEPT EVERYTHING BETWEEN HIS SECRETARY HELEN GANDY AND HIS CLOSE PAL....</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.899" end="00:03:54.168">&gt;&gt; Jon: CLYDE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.168" end="00:04:00.040">HELEN GANDI IS THE WOMAN WE SAW HIM PROPOSING TO IN THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS WHICH, AS </p>
<p begin="00:04:00.040" end="00:04:04.311">WE ALL KNOW WHEN IT&apos;S CLOSED IT&apos;S ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC LIBRARIES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.311" end="00:04:07.781">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A BEAUTIFUL SPOT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.781" end="00:04:09.082">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE PROPOSES TO HER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.082" end="00:04:13.220">SHE TURNS HIM DOWN BUT SHE BASICALLY WORKS WITH HIM HIS WHOLE LIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.220" end="00:04:14.354">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.354" end="00:04:18.959">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND CLYDE HAS GOT THESE TWO PEOPLE THAT STAY WITH HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:21.495">IS THAT AS FAR AS HIS INNER CIRCLE WENT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.495" end="00:04:23.263">&gt;&gt; AS FAR AS I KNOW, IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.263" end="00:04:25.732">I MEAN, MAYBE ALONG THE WAY...</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.732" end="00:04:30.804">HE HAD A LOT OF SECOND IN COMMANDS THAT WOULD COME AND GO BUT HE ALSO ALWAYS SEEMED </p>
<p begin="00:04:30.804" end="00:04:33.874">TO HAVE SOME CONTENTION WITH THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.874" end="00:04:38.111">HE NEVER IT&apos;S HIS BRAIN TRUST WAS CLYDE AND HELEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.111" end="00:04:46.253">&gt;&gt; Jon: AT THE TIME OF HIS LIFE, HOW CONTROVERSIAL WAS CLYDE IN HIS LIFE WORLD?</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.253" end="00:04:50.557">HE WASN&apos;T NECESSARILY QUALIFIED TO BE THE NUMBER TWO OR THEY WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER?</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.557" end="00:04:52.092">WAS THAT WHISPERED ABOUT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.092" end="00:04:53.527">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT WAS ALWAYS TOGETHER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.527" end="00:04:55.429">THEY WERE JUST INSEPARABLE PALS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.429" end="00:05:01.802">IN THOSE DAYS, NOBODY MADE TOO MANY INSINUATIONS LIKE NOWADAYS EVERYBODY INSINUATES </p>
<p begin="00:05:01.802" end="00:05:05.272">THE OBVIOUS OR WHAT THEY WOULD THINK THE OBVIOUS IS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.272" end="00:05:06.073">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.073" end="00:05:18.051">DO YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THEY WERE UNREQUITED, THAT IT WAS JUST THIS KIND OF TENSION BUT NEVER....</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.051" end="00:05:20.487">&gt;&gt; CONSUMMATED?</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.487" end="00:05:24.191">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT IS AN EXCELLENT WAY OF PUTTING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.191" end="00:05:29.897">&gt;&gt; I&apos;VE BEEN ON NPR BEFORE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.897" end="00:05:31.798">(  <span tts:fontStyle="italic">CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</span> </p>
<p begin="00:05:31.798" end="00:05:33.934">&gt;&gt; Jon: TRYING TO BE DELICATE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.934" end="00:05:36.637">&gt;&gt; YEAH, I DON&apos;T KNOW ABOUT THAT IMPLICATION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.637" end="00:05:46.413">I JUST KIND OF WENT AS A TRUE LOVE STORY, ACTUALLY A LOVE STORY BETWEEN THE THREE PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.413" end="00:05:48.081">WHERE IT GOES FROM THERE, I DON&apos;T KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.081" end="00:05:53.754">PLUS THE FOURTH PERSON BEING HIS MOTHER BECAUSE HE WAS VERY INFLUENCED BY HIS MOTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.754" end="00:06:04.865">SHE HAD... WE PORTRAYED HER AND WROTE IT IN THE SCRIPT THAT THE MOTHER WAS A VERY DOMINANT PERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.865" end="00:06:07.334">EVERYBODY ELSE SEEMS TO CORROBORATE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.334" end="00:06:12.472">&gt;&gt; Jon: A COUPLE OF THOSE SCENES WHERE I THOUGHT HE&apos;S GOING TO GO FULL ON CARRIE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.472" end="00:06:16.710">HOOVER IS GOING TO GO TO THE PROM AND THE WALLS ARE GOING TO POOR BLOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.710" end="00:06:17.344">IT&apos;S INTENSE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.344" end="00:06:18.378">BUT IT&apos;S GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.378" end="00:06:19.746">IT&apos;S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.746" end="00:06:22.649">YOU WOULD HAVE MADE A FINE G- MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.649" end="00:06:25.953">THERE&apos;S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU THAT I FEEL LIKE I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT YOU CARRY </p>
<p begin="00:06:25.953" end="00:06:29.656">YOURSELF WITH A CERTAIN AIR OF LAW AND ORDER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.656" end="00:06:34.228">&gt;&gt; YOU FEEL VERY SAFE AROUND ME?</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.228" end="00:06:41.668">&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE YOU ASKING ME TO MOVE IN WITH YOU?</p>
