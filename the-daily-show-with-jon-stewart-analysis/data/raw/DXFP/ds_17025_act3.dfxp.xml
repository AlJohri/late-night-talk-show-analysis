<p begin="00:01:01.428" end="00:01:03.430">THE ONE ABOUT YOUR MOTHER KILLED ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.430" end="00:01:07.367">&gt;&gt; THAT IS SO LOVELY OF YOU TO SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.367" end="00:01:08.168">MY MOTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.168" end="00:01:14.474">IT OCCURRED TO ME AT SOME POINT WHEN I DID MY STUDIES-- BY THAT I MEAN TALKING TO MY </p>
<p begin="00:01:14.474" end="00:01:19.279">FRIENDS-- THAT ALL COMEDIANS SEEM TO HAVE ONE ONE OR TWO OF THE SAME PATTERN MOTHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.279" end="00:01:26.453">IT&apos;S LIKE THE SAME MOM INVENTED STAND-UP COMEDY RAISED ALL THE COMEDIANS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.453" end="00:01:32.826">WHAT&apos;S BAD FOR CHILDHOOD TRUST ISSUES IS REALLY GOOD FOR COMEDY ROUTINES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.826" end="00:01:35.229">IT&apos;S LIKE BEING RAISED BY A HECKLER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.229" end="00:01:39.266">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHING).</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.266" end="00:01:40.234">HER DIARY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.234" end="00:01:42.102">WHEN DID YOU DISCOVER YOUR DIARYS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.102" end="00:01:45.639">&gt;&gt; WELL, MY MOTHER HAS BEEN DEAD FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.639" end="00:01:51.345">RIGHT WHEN SHE DIED AND I WAS KIND OF PUTTING... GOING THROUGH HER STUFF AND </p>
<p begin="00:01:51.345" end="00:01:55.782">FIGURING... I KNEW SHE KEPT A LITTLE STACK OF DIARIES WHICH ARE IN THIS BOOK BY THE WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.782" end="00:01:57.751">I GUESS I&apos;LL BE GOING TO HELL RIGHT AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.751" end="00:01:58.752">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.752" end="00:02:00.821">THEY&apos;RE MAGNIFICENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.821" end="00:02:03.790">I WOULD BUY A TRAVEL BOOK WRITTEN BY YOUR MOTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.790" end="00:02:06.527">&gt;&gt; I THINK SHE WAS KIND OF WRITING A TRAVEL BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.527" end="00:02:11.164">AFTER SHE DIED I WENT THROUGH HER DIARIES THINKING... SHE WAS A REALLY ANGRY PERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.164" end="00:02:14.234">I THOUGHT I WOULD FIND OUT WHY SHE WAS ANGRY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.234" end="00:02:17.237">I THOUGHT SHE WAS DOING IN HER DIARIES WHAT I DO IN MINE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.237" end="00:02:17.604">.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.604" end="00:02:17.971">COMPLAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.971" end="00:02:21.675">SHE WAS BUT SHE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.675" end="00:02:23.777">SHE WAS TRAVELING AND HAVING A BAD TIME EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.777" end="00:02:28.315">SHE WAS GOING FROM PLACE TO PLACE TO PLACE JUST LEVELING EVERYONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.315" end="00:02:31.285">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT&apos;S NICE ABOUT IT IS THERE&apos;S NO REASON WHY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.285" end="00:02:38.859">IT&apos;S NOT, &quot;MY LIFE, SO DIFFICULT.&quot; IT&apos;S LIKE,&quot; I&apos;M IN TURKEY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.859" end="00:02:43.397">THE BEEF IS MUSHY.&quot; IT&apos;S AWESOME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.397" end="00:02:48.702">&gt;&gt; I READ THE ONE TODAY THAT WAS FROM DUBLIN WHERE SHE SAID, &quot;THE COUNTRYSIDE OF </p>
<p begin="00:02:48.702" end="00:02:52.406">DUBLIN DOES NOT ENCHANT ME.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:02:52.406" end="00:02:53.774">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHING).</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.774" end="00:02:57.878">&gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL IT&apos;S NOT SUPPOSED TO ENCHANT YOU NECESSARILY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.878" end="00:02:59.213">MY MOTHER WAS REALLY CRITICAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.213" end="00:03:04.318">WHEN I FIRST SHOWED HER SOMETHING I HAD WRITTEN, IT WAS THE PROBLEM I HAD WITH HER GROWING UP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.318" end="00:03:07.287">THE FIRST TIME I SHOWED HER SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.287" end="00:03:10.657">SHE CONSIDERED HERSELF MY MENTOR AS A WRITER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.657" end="00:03:13.160">SHE READS THIS THING AND I&apos;M PACING AROUND IN MY ROOM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.160" end="00:03:14.928">I COME OUT AND I SEE SHE&apos;S STARING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.928" end="00:03:21.235">I SAY, &quot;SO, WHAT DID YOU THINK?&quot; SHE SAYS, &quot;I DON&apos;T HAPPEN TO </p>
<p begin="00:03:21.235" end="00:03:24.705">CARE FOR IT BUT I PRAY I&apos;M WRONG.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:24.705" end="00:03:30.377">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHING) BUT THE DIARIES ARE SUCH A GIFT BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU AN INSIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.377" end="00:03:33.080">I&apos;M SURE FOR THE LONGEST TIME YOU THOUGHT IT WAS PERSONAL TO YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.080" end="00:03:35.249">&gt;&gt; YES, I THOUGHT IT WAS PERSONAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.249" end="00:03:39.286">THEN AFTER SHE DIED I WAS GOING THROUGH ALL HER STUFF SO I WENT THROUGH THE DIARIES AND </p>
<p begin="00:03:39.286" end="00:03:43.857">I FOUND FOUND OUT THERE WASN&apos;T A SINGLE COUNTRY ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH SHE HAVE WASN&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:03:43.857" end="00:03:48.462">COMPLAINING ABOUT BUT REALLY THE QUINTESSENTIAL THING WAS THAT I FOUND HER DICKENS </p>
<p begin="00:03:48.462" end="00:03:49.730">READER FROM COLLEGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.730" end="00:03:50.497">CHARLES DICKENS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.497" end="00:03:56.170">I FOUND IN THE MARGINS OF OLIVER TWIST THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE: NOT ONE OF HIS BEST WORKS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.170" end="00:03:58.305">I WAS NOT IMPRESSED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.305" end="00:04:03.810">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHING).</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.810" end="00:04:06.480">WHEN I GOT TO THAT, IT KILLED ME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:07.848">&gt;&gt; IT KILLED ME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.848" end="00:04:11.685">I THOUGHT,&quot; AND I&apos;M LOOKING FOR PRAISE FROM THIS WOMAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.685" end="00:04:14.721">&gt;&gt; Jon: IN A WEIRD WAY WASN&apos;T THAT A GRAND RELIEF?</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.721" end="00:04:15.255">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.255" end="00:04:19.793">&gt;&gt; Jon: TO THINK, OH, SHE ACTUALLY PROBABLY THINKS I&apos;M BETTER THAN DICKENS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.793" end="00:04:24.431">&gt;&gt; SHE DIDN&apos;T GIVE THE WOMEN OF B ACHL LI A BREAK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.431" end="00:04:25.666">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE THING IN THERE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.666" end="00:04:26.567">TOO, YOUR DAD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.567" end="00:04:29.469">YOU SAID YOU CALLED HIM RIGHT AFTERWARDS TO CHECK ON HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.469" end="00:04:30.704">HE COULDN&apos;T TALK TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.704" end="00:04:33.874">&gt;&gt; HE SAID, MERRILL, LET ME CALL YOU BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.874" end="00:04:36.109">I&apos;M HAVING A HOT CUP OF COFFEE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.109" end="00:04:40.180">BETWEEN THEM THEY WERE LIKE A TAG TEAM FOR LOW SELF-ESTEEM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.180" end="00:04:41.481">&gt;&gt; Jon: UNBELIEVABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.481" end="00:04:44.451">BUT YOU USED THIS FOR THE GOOD OF HUMANITY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.451" end="00:04:48.622">THERE&apos;S A GREAT CHAPTER IN THERE ABOUT HOW TO SPOT A (BEEP).</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.622" end="00:04:51.925">&gt;&gt; I&apos;VE MADE MY LIFE&apos;S WORK SPOTTING (BEEP) NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.925" end="00:04:56.797">YOU KNOW, I THINK IT&apos;S HARDER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE BECAUSE THERE&apos;S SO MANY SOCIALLY </p>
<p begin="00:04:56.797" end="00:05:01.368">ACCEPTABLE WAYS TO EXHIBIT A PATHOLOGICAL LACK OF EMPATHY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.368" end="00:05:04.705">BUT I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE ALL NEED TO LIVE BY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.705" end="00:05:08.842">FOR INSTANCE, I THINK-- AND I KNOW THIS IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL-- BUT I THINK </p>
<p begin="00:05:08.842" end="00:05:15.415">THAT YOU SHOULD PUT A SECRET GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT YOU CARRY WITH YOU ON YOUR TEST </p>
<p begin="00:05:15.415" end="00:05:17.718">EQUIPMENT SECOND TO THE PERSON YOU&apos;RE SITTING WITH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.718" end="00:05:19.453">I KNOW THAT&apos;S VERY CONTROVERSIAL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.453" end="00:05:24.258">&gt;&gt; Jon: IF I WERE AT THIS MOMENT, LET&apos;S SAY, CHECKING EMAIL, THAT WOULD BE WRONG.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.258" end="00:05:25.492">I WOULD BE AN (BEEP).</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.492" end="00:05:28.829">&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IS A SIGN OF AN (BEEP).</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.829" end="00:05:33.700">IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD NOBODY IS EVER NOT ON THE PHONE ALL THE TIME INCLUDING WHEN THEY&apos;RE </p>
<p begin="00:05:33.700" end="00:05:34.401">WALKING THEIR DOGS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.401" end="00:05:39.773">I DO THIS JUST WHEN I&apos;M WALKING MY DOGS JUST SO PEOPLE WON&apos;T THINK I&apos;M WEIRD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.773" end="00:05:41.341">YOU HAVE TO NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.341" end="00:05:42.543">BUT I THINK IT&apos;S RUDE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.543" end="00:05:45.345">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DO THINK IT&apos;S RUDE AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.345" end="00:05:47.147">THERE&apos;S SOMETHING HERE ABOUT DOGS IS GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.147" end="00:05:51.151">I THINK AFTER YOU READ THIS BOOK, I THINK (BEEP) SPOTTING WILL....</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.151" end="00:05:52.553">&gt;&gt; A NEW NATIONAL PASTIME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.553" end="00:05:55.989">&gt;&gt; Jon: A NEW NATIONAL PASTIME TO RIVAL BIRD WATCHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.989" end="00:05:56.490">ABSOLUTELY GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.490" end="00:05:57.891">THANK YOU SO MUCH.</p>
