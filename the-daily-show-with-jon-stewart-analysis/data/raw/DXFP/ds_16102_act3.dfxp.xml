<p begin="00:00:06.473" end="00:00:10.878">MY GUEST TONIGHT IS IS THE SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF ILLINOIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.878" end="00:00:16.083">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW SENATOR DICK DURBIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.083" end="00:00:17.351">SIR, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.351" end="00:00:20.254">[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.254" end="00:00:22.956">HOW ARE YOU DOING?</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.956" end="00:00:24.658">THAT WAS NICE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.658" end="00:00:26.226">YOU SAW THE SHOW BACK IN THE GREEN ROOM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.226" end="00:00:27.494">&gt;&gt; YEAH, I DID.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.494" end="00:00:29.029">&gt;&gt; Jon: I APOLOGIZE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.029" end="00:00:33.634">NORMALLY THAT&apos;S THE KIND OF STUFF WE WOULD SHOW SOMEONE FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.634" end="00:00:35.569">YOU ARE MORE OBVIOUSLY ESTEEMINGED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.569" end="00:00:36.703">HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.703" end="00:00:38.438">YOU&apos;VE BEEN AT THE SENATE HOW LONG?</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.438" end="00:00:39.273">&gt;&gt; 15 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.273" end="00:00:41.675">&gt;&gt; Jon: 15 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.675" end="00:00:43.877">IS THIS THE WORST IT&apos;S BEEN?</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.877" end="00:00:50.284">DO YOU SENSE PEOPLE&apos;S UPSET WITH CONGRESS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.284" end="00:00:55.989">&gt;&gt; JON, THEY SAY THE APPROVAL RATING OF CONGRESS IS BETWEEN 6 AND 19.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.989" end="00:01:00.127">I DON&apos;T THINK WE HAVE THAT MANY RELATIVES, SO I GET...</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.127" end="00:01:01.295">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S UGLY OUT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.295" end="00:01:03.797">&gt;&gt; THE NUMBERS ARE INFLATED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.797" end="00:01:04.164">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.164" end="00:01:09.403">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS IT... DO YOU... DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE </p>
<p begin="00:01:09.403" end="00:01:16.276">THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE FRUSTRATED WITH, FOR INSTANCE, THIS DEBT CEILING ISSUE AND THE DEFICIT </p>
<p begin="00:01:16.276" end="00:01:18.946">REDUCTION PLANS AND THOSE THINGS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.946" end="00:01:22.583">ARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEING INCREDIBLY UNFAIR, OR CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR UPSET?</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.583" end="00:01:23.550">&gt;&gt; OH, I DO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.550" end="00:01:24.952">I UNDERSTAND IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.952" end="00:01:28.655">HERE WE HAVE AN ECONOMY WITH TOO MANY PEOPLE OUT OF WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.655" end="00:01:30.457">WE&apos;RE NOT GETTING WELL FAST ENOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.457" end="00:01:35.596">AND UP COMES THE IDEA OF DEFAULTING ON AMERICA&apos;S DEBT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.596" end="00:01:36.697">LET&apos;S SEE HOW THAT WORKS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.697" end="00:01:38.832">AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY, WELL,</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.832" end="00:01:41.101">THAT&apos;S SELF-INFLICTED WOUND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.101" end="00:01:43.570">IT IS A POLITICALLY MANUFACTURED CRISIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.570" end="00:01:50.110">IT&apos;S JUST GOING THE MAKE THINGS WORSE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.110" end="00:01:52.513">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU IN ESSENCE DON&apos;T CARE FOR CONGRESS EITHER?</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.513" end="00:01:55.616">&gt;&gt; TRUST ME, THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I DON&apos;T, AND I&apos;M PRETTY </p>
<p begin="00:01:55.616" end="00:01:57.918">CLOSE TO IT, SO I SEE IT BEHIND THE SCENES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.918" end="00:01:59.453">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S SO INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.453" end="00:02:02.089">THE DEFICIT REDUCTION PLAN THAT WE GOT SEEMS VERY SIMILAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.089" end="00:02:08.328">YOU WERE ON THIS SIMPSON-BOWL COMMITTEE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.328" end="00:02:17.237">NOW THAT WAS CREATED TO COME UP WITH A THOUGHTFUL, BIPARTISAN SOLUTION LONG TERM TO OUR CRISIS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.237" end="00:02:18.639">HOW LONG DID YOU WORK ON THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.639" end="00:02:20.207">&gt;&gt; TEN MONTHS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.207" end="00:02:24.611">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND IT WAS... WHAT WAS IT INVOLVED IN?</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.611" end="00:02:32.719">&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE WERE 18 OF US APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE LEADERS IN CONGRESS, PRETTY </p>
<p begin="00:02:32.719" end="00:02:35.255">WELL EVENLY DIVIDED IN TERMS OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS,</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.255" end="00:02:37.624">BUSINESS SECTOR AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO WORK IN GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.624" end="00:02:40.260">AND WE SAT AND CONSIDERED ALL THE OPTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.260" end="00:02:46.600">AT THE END OF IT, AND I THAWING ERSKINE BOWLES DID A MASTERFUL JOB, THEY SAID, HERE IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.600" end="00:02:48.368">WHEN I LOOKED AT IT, I THOUGHT,</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.368" end="00:02:51.104">AT THE END OF THE DAY, THERE AREIN&apos; MANY OPTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.104" end="00:02:56.109">YOU HAVE BASICALLY THREE THINGS -- SPENDING, GENERAL SPENDING, THE ENTITLEMENT </p>
<p begin="00:02:56.109" end="00:02:58.245">PROGRAMS AND REVENUE OR TAXES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.245" end="00:03:01.448">AND IF YOU DON&apos;T PUT THEM ALL ON THE TABLE, YOU&apos;RE GOING TO TAKE </p>
<p begin="00:03:01.448" end="00:03:03.083">TOO MUCH OUT OF ONE OR THE OTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.083" end="00:03:04.685">I VOTED FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.685" end="00:03:06.253">11 OUT OF 18 VOTED FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.253" end="00:03:07.955">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS DID NOT MAKE IT TO CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.955" end="00:03:08.655">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.655" end="00:03:13.794">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY NEVER GOT CHANCE TO DO ANYTHING WITH IT BECAUSE THE GROUP THAT WAS FORMED TO </p>
<p begin="00:03:13.794" end="00:03:16.096">MAKE IT REJECTED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.096" end="00:03:18.866">&gt;&gt; 11 OUT OF 18 DID.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.866" end="00:03:20.300">AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GET 14,</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.300" end="00:03:22.669">BUT THE CLOCK HAD RUN OUT ON US TO BE HONEST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.669" end="00:03:24.538">THAT&apos;S WHY THE GANG OF SIX CAME ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.538" end="00:03:26.340">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S NEXT STEP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.340" end="00:03:28.542">&gt;&gt; SACKSBY CHAMBLISS OF GEORGIA,</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.542" end="00:03:30.377">MARK WARNER OF VIRGINIA SAID,</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.377" end="00:03:34.548">CAN WE TAKE THIS BOLD IDEA AND ACTUALLY TURN IT INTO LEGISLATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.548" end="00:03:36.917">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU WERE ON THE GANG OF SIX, AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.917" end="00:03:38.285">&gt;&gt; I WAS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.285" end="00:03:40.554">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE GANG OF SIX,</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.554" end="00:03:44.691">SIMPSON BOWLES SOUNDS LIKE A BRITISH WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.691" end="00:03:45.659">THAT&apos;S NOT GOING TO BE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.659" end="00:03:49.930">BUT GANG OF SIX, THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.930" end="00:03:52.199">NOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET HURT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.199" end="00:03:52.699">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.699" end="00:03:54.101">WHAT HAPPENS THEN?</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.101" end="00:03:57.404">&gt;&gt; FIRST THE TATTOOS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.404" end="00:03:58.138">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.138" end="00:03:59.773">&gt;&gt; Jon: TERRIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.773" end="00:04:01.708">A FEW SECRET HANDSHAKES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.708" end="00:04:04.244">THEN WE SAT DOWN FOR ABOUT FIVE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.244" end="00:04:05.779">SIX MONTHS AND WORKED IT THROUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.779" end="00:04:08.482">HOW DO WE TURN THIS IDEA INTO A LAW?</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.482" end="00:04:09.883">IT WASN&apos;T EASY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.883" end="00:04:11.051">BUT WE DID IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.051" end="00:04:13.554">AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DID IT TOO LATE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.554" end="00:04:16.623">IF THERE&apos;S ANYTHING, ANY FAULT THAT WE&apos;D HAVE WITH OUR EFFORT,</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.623" end="00:04:20.561">WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS WEEKS BEFORE SO WE WERE PLAYERS IN THIS LAST CONVERSATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.561" end="00:04:22.129">BUT HERE&apos;S WHAT WAS INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.129" end="00:04:27.434">WE HELD A MEETING ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO, INVITED 70 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAD EXPRESSED AN </p>
<p begin="00:04:27.434" end="00:04:31.338">INTEREST IN THIS TO COME AROUND AND LET US TELL YOU WHAT WE&apos;VE DECIDED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.338" end="00:04:32.739">49 SHOWED UP.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.739" end="00:04:33.440">EQUALLY INVITED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:35.709">THEN WE SAID, ALL RIGHT, LET&apos;S TAKE THE NEXT STEP.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.709" end="00:04:39.446">ARE YOU READY TO SIGN ON THE LINE HERE, PUT YOUR NAME NEXT TO THIS THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.446" end="00:04:43.083">36 SENATORS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, SAID, WE&apos;LL SIGN IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.083" end="00:04:44.618">AND IT&apos;S THE REAL THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.618" end="00:04:45.719">IT ISN&apos;T A JOKE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.719" end="00:04:48.622">I MEAN, IT REALLY DOES GET TO THE BOTTOM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.622" end="00:04:54.194">THAT&apos;S WHAT, DESPITE ALL THE NEGATIVE FEELINGS PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT CONGRESS, THERE IS A FORCE </p>
<p begin="00:04:54.194" end="00:05:00.133">AT WORK HERE AMONG AT LEAST THE SENATORS THAT I SERVE WITH, A BIPARTISAN FORCE, THAT GETS IT RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.133" end="00:05:09.209">AND I THINK IT, WITH THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY, CAN DEAL WITH THIS IN A GROWN-UP WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.209" end="00:05:11.278">SO WHAT WE&apos;VE JUST SEEN WAS EMBARRASSING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.278" end="00:05:13.680">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO 16 MONTHS YOU PUT IN ON THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:15.782">&gt;&gt; MAKE IT 16 TO 18 MONTHS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.782" end="00:05:19.353">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU COULD HAVE HAD TWO KIDS IN THAT TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.353" end="00:05:21.421">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A RECURRING THEME ON THIS SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.421" end="00:05:22.789">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT REALLY IS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.789" end="00:05:30.564">BUT IN THAT TIME, YOU HONED THIS DOWN, AND YET ULTIMATELY IT&apos;S NOT EVEN CONSIDERED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.564" end="00:05:31.265">ALL THAT WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.265" end="00:05:36.670">IS THAT THE FRAMEWORK THAT WILL BE USED IN THE NEXT FIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.670" end="00:05:41.542">OR AT WHAT POINT ARE YOU JUST ON A STATIONARY BICYCLE AND WHAT...</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.542" end="00:05:44.077">BECAUSE NOW THERE IS AN IDEA OF A SUPER COMMITTEE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.077" end="00:05:44.912">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.912" end="00:05:50.217">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT WILL BE THE GANG OF SIX BUT WITH FIVES OR WHATEVER THEY&apos;RE GOING TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.217" end="00:05:52.920">AND WHAT WILL THAT ACCOMPLISH?</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.920" end="00:05:55.956">&gt;&gt; WELL, IN FAIRNESS, WE WEREN&apos;T READY FOR PRIME TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.956" end="00:05:58.792">WE DIDN&apos;T HAVE THIS THING IN WRITING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.792" end="00:05:59.893">WE WEREN&apos;T THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.893" end="00:06:03.130">BUT WE&apos;RE CLOSE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN GET THERE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.130" end="00:06:05.399">SO ALONG COMES THE IDEA OF A JOINT COMMITTEE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.399" end="00:06:06.800">NOW, I&apos;VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.800" end="00:06:12.139">I SAW IT IN THE ORIGINAL ENGLISH WITH BOWLES-SIMPSON.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.139" end="00:06:15.075">AND THEN I SAW IT IN SUBTITLES IN GANG OF SIX.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.075" end="00:06:18.312">AND NOW THEY&apos;RE GOING...</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.312" end="00:06:19.580">WHATEVER IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.580" end="00:06:21.381">IT ALWAYS ENDS THE SAME WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.381" end="00:06:22.950">YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME THINGS ON THE TABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.950" end="00:06:27.187">WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO EACH OF THESE THAT&apos;S GOOD TO THE ECONOMY AND FAIR TO EVERYBODY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.187" end="00:06:32.726">SO I HOPE THAT AT SOME POINT THIS JOINT COMMITTEE TAKES WHAT WE&apos;VE DONE AND PUTS IT ON THE </p>
<p begin="00:06:32.726" end="00:06:34.561">TABLE AND SAYS, LET&apos;S SAVE SOME TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.561" end="00:06:40.367">THIS JOINT COMMITTEE HAS TEN WEEKS, LITERALLY TEN WEEKS START TO FINISH TO COME UP WITH THE PRODUCT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.367" end="00:06:41.368">THAT&apos;S NOT A LOT OF TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.368" end="00:06:44.972">&gt;&gt; NOW IS THAT A PRODUCT THAT THEN NEEDS TO BE VOTED ON BY THE </p>
<p begin="00:06:44.972" end="00:06:46.373">FULL HOUSE AND THE FULL SENATE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.373" end="00:06:49.943">&gt;&gt; AND IF IT FAILS, IN COMES THE SO-CALLED TRIGGERS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.943" end="00:06:58.752">THAT MEANS DEEP SPENDING CUTS ON THE DOMESTIC SIDE WHERE WE&apos;VE ALREADYIEN A -- ALREADY TAKE AN </p>
<p begin="00:06:58.752" end="00:06:59.319">BIG CUT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.319" end="00:07:03.090">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU FEEL ANY REGRETS THAT THE DEMOCRATS, WHEN THEY HAD CONTROL OF THE HOUSE </p>
<p begin="00:07:03.090" end="00:07:07.828">AND SENATE, DIDN&apos;T JUST PASS A BUG WHEN THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO, DIDN&apos;T PUNCH IT </p>
<p begin="00:07:07.828" end="00:07:12.566">OUT OF FEAR OF LOSING SEATS IN THE HOUSE, SO THAT THE REPUBLICANS COULD COME IN,</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.566" end="00:07:16.737">CHANGE THAT SO-CALLED GEPHARDT RULE AND MAKE IT SO THAT THE DEBT CEILING DOESN&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:07:16.737" end="00:07:18.939">AUTOMATICALLY GET RAISED IN A BUDGET?</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.939" end="00:07:24.678">IF THEY HAD DONE THAT, WOULDN&apos;T THAT HAVE BASICALLY AVOIDED THIS ENTIRE DEBACLE?</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.678" end="00:07:26.914">&gt;&gt; WE COULD HAVE SPARED OURSELVES OF THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.914" end="00:07:28.482">AND I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.482" end="00:07:34.154">YOU KNOW, THERE&apos;S SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR, AND I&apos;LL POINT THE FINGER ON MY </p>
<p begin="00:07:34.154" end="00:07:35.255">REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES.</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.255" end="00:07:36.857">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW THAT SEEMS SURPRISING.</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.857" end="00:07:37.891">&gt;&gt; IS THAT OKAY?</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.891" end="00:07:38.625">&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.625" end="00:07:42.729">&gt;&gt; MANY OF THEM HAVE SAID THEY LIKE WAR, THEY LIKE WAGING WAR,</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.729" end="00:07:45.566">THEY LIKE THE NOTION OF STAYING IN WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.566" end="00:07:48.535">THEY THINK WE SHOULD SPEND A LOT OF MONEY IN WAR, AND WHEN THE </p>
