<p begin="00:01:19.847" end="00:01:21.181">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.181" end="00:01:22.082">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS IT DIFFICULT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.082" end="00:01:25.285">WE DO THIS SHOW EVERYDAY AND SOME DAYS IT CAN SUCK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.285" end="00:01:31.225">(LAUGHTER) BUT WHEN IT DOES, WE COME BACK IN THE NEXT DAY AND WE DO IT AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.225" end="00:01:38.098">A FILM YOU INVESTED... HOW MUCH TIME DID YOU PUT INTO MAKING JUST THIS FILM &quot;SUPER 8&quot;?</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.098" end="00:01:42.669">&gt;&gt; THE MOVIE TOOK ABOUT A YEAR OR SO FROM THE IDEA TO ACTUALLY START SHOOTING AND THEN WE </p>
<p begin="00:01:42.669" end="00:01:45.405">STARTED SHOOTING LAST SEPTEMBER SO IT WAS A VERY QUICK....</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.405" end="00:01:47.608">&gt;&gt; Jon: FOR FILM MAKING THAT&apos;S AWFULLY QUICK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.608" end="00:01:50.611">&gt;&gt; IT WAS A QUICK PRODUCTION AND POST-PRODUCTION SCHEDULE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.611" end="00:01:53.747">INSANELY TIGHT POST-PRODUCTION SCHEDULE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.747" end="00:01:57.017">&gt;&gt; Jon: EVEN WITHIN THAT, HOW DIFFICULT IS IT FOR-TO-LAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT OUT AND WAIT </p>
<p begin="00:01:57.017" end="00:01:58.118">FOR THAT ONE WEEKEND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.118" end="00:02:04.157">WHAT DO YOU DO ON THAT ONE WEEKEND WHEN ALL THIS EFFORT AND ENERGY AND WRITING GOES INTO THE OPENING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.157" end="00:02:06.727">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE A NERVOUS WRECK BECAUSE THE IDEA THAT IT&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:02:06.727" end="00:02:08.228">THROUGHOUT... IT&apos;S A WEIRD THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.228" end="00:02:09.429">POST-PRODUCTION IS LIKE EIGHT PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.429" end="00:02:12.065">THE EDITORS, THE ASSISTANCE EDITORS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.065" end="00:02:15.636">YOU&apos;RE ALL JUST WORKING TOGETHER FOR MONTHS IN THIS CAVE AND THEN </p>
<p begin="00:02:15.636" end="00:02:18.438">IN AN INSTANT IT&apos;S JUST OUT THERE AND YOU&apos;RE MEETING </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.438" end="00:02:22.943">STRANGERS AND YOU&apos;RE LIKE &quot;YOU KNOW THAT SCENE LIKE HOW DO YOU </p>
<p begin="00:02:22.943" end="00:02:25.679">KNOW...&quot; SUDDEN IT&apos;S NOT JUST THE EIGHT OF YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.679" end="00:02:27.614">&gt;&gt; Jon: HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT NOT BEING IN A CAVE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.614" end="00:02:29.783">(LAUGHTER) BECAUSE... AND, AGAIN, I DON&apos;T KNOW...</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.783" end="00:02:33.253">(LAUGHTER) I DON&apos;T KNOW HOLLYWOOD AND I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW THINGS WORK OUT </p>
<p begin="00:02:33.253" end="00:02:39.660">THERE, BUT A MAN OF YOUR... YOU COULD DO THIS FROM A GROTTO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:40.961">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:40.961" end="00:02:43.597">&gt;&gt; NEXT TIME I&apos;LL TRY NOT EDITING IN THE CAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.597" end="00:02:47.401">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY CAN SPEAK TO YOU LIKE THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.401" end="00:02:51.171">PEOPLE JUST COME UP ON THE STREET AND THEY&apos;RE LIKE &quot;THAT ONE SCENE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.171" end="00:02:55.976">I DIDN&apos;T CARE FOR IT.&quot; LIKE THAT KIND OF?</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.976" end="00:02:57.344">&gt;&gt; NO, I THINK WHAT HAPPENS....</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.344" end="00:02:57.711">&gt;&gt; Jon: </p>
<p begin="00:02:57.711" end="00:02:59.580">&gt;&gt; YOU TOO, NEW YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.580" end="00:03:04.918">&gt;&gt; NO, I THINK THAT... I THINK... MY DAD LIKED THE MOVIE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.918" end="00:03:09.356">I THINK IT&apos;S HARD SOMETIMES BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST DON&apos;T TELL </p>
<p begin="00:03:09.356" end="00:03:14.728">YOU THE TRUTH AND THEY&apos;LL, OF COURSE, SAY THINGS, OH, THAT WAS GREAT AND YOU KIND OF SEE THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:14.728" end="00:03:21.368">SHALLOWNESS LIKE, UM... SO THE KEY IS FINDING PEOPLE LIKE, I DON&apos;T KNOW, MY WIFE, WHO WILL </p>
<p begin="00:03:21.368" end="00:03:25.072">JUST KICK YOUR ASS IF SOMETHING ISN&apos;T RIGHT AND JUST BE TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU BECAUSE THEN </p>
<p begin="00:03:25.072" end="00:03:28.141">WHEN THEY LOVE IT AND THEY SAY &quot;I LOVE IT&quot; YOU KNOW IT&apos;S REAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.141" end="00:03:29.643">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND IT MEANS SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.643" end="00:03:30.744">&gt;&gt; IT MEANS SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.744" end="00:03:32.079">&gt;&gt; Jon: CAN I HAVE YOUR WIFE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.079" end="00:03:36.083">(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE...</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.083" end="00:03:37.818">&gt;&gt; NO, MY WIFE IS CRITICAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.818" end="00:03:42.856">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU TRUST THEIR OPINION BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY TO YOU WOW, THAT WAS TERRIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.856" end="00:03:45.325">THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.325" end="00:03:46.326">HOW DO YOU WORK?</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.326" end="00:03:47.861">DO YOU WORK BACKWARDS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.861" end="00:03:52.933">DO YOU KNOW... YOUR MOVIES AND YOUR TELEVISION SHOWS ARE SO LAYERED AND THERE&apos;S SO MUCH </p>
<p begin="00:03:52.933" end="00:03:53.534">GOING ON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.534" end="00:03:59.673">DO YOU START WITH THE DESTINATION AND WORK YOUR WAY BACK OR...</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.673" end="00:04:01.775">&gt;&gt; IT ALL DEPENDS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.775" end="00:04:08.515">OBVIOUSLY T.V. IS LINEAR NARRATIVE DRAMA SHOWS ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND DOING A MOVIE </p>
<p begin="00:04:08.515" end="00:04:10.384">BECAUSE IT&apos;S BEGINNING, MIDDLE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.384" end="00:04:13.787">AND END OF A MOVIE (A T.V. SHOW IT&apos;S ALWAYS A LEAP OF FAITH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.787" end="00:04:14.121">ALWAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.121" end="00:04:17.157">YOU HAVE BIG IDEAS, YOU GO &quot;I THINK I KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:04:17.157" end="00:04:23.964">SO WHEN I WROTE THE PILOT FOR &quot;LOST&quot; WE LAD A TON OF BIG IDEAS BUT THERE WERE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.964" end="00:04:28.969">LIKE IF EVERYONE KNOW IT IS SHOW VEN, BLINDNESS WASN&apos;T IN THE PILOT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.969" end="00:04:35.075">AND DAMON AND CARLSON WHO RAN &quot;LOST&quot;, THOSE GUYS CAME UP WITH EVERYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.075" end="00:04:36.743">I WENT OFF AND DID A MOVIE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.743" end="00:04:39.446">THOSE GUYS WERE BUSTING THEIR ASS ON THAT SHOW FOR SIX YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.446" end="00:04:43.083">SO MY POINT IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE IDEAS BUT IT&apos;S LIKE DRIVING IN THE FOG.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.083" end="00:04:47.921">YOU SORT OF... THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE DESTINATION THE MORE DETAIL YOU SEE, THE WHO ARE M </p>
<p begin="00:04:47.921" end="00:04:49.523">YOU REALIZE LET&apos;S TAKE THIS ROAD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.523" end="00:04:52.192">SO IT EVOLVES AS YOU GO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.192" end="00:04:54.995">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO IN THAT FOG AS YOU&apos;RE PULLING UP CLOSER AND THE FOG </p>
<p begin="00:04:54.995" end="00:04:57.998">CLEARS AND YOU GO &quot;OH, MY GOD,</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.998" end="00:05:04.505">KERI RUSSELL CUT HER HAIR!&quot; (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:04.505" end="00:05:05.706">&gt;&gt; UNBELIEVABLE, HUH?</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.706" end="00:05:10.344">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE CREATIVE SYNERGY OF THAT, IT&apos;S VERY DIFFICULT TO TRUST THAT COLLABORATIVE PROCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.344" end="00:05:15.415">TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT COMPLEX HAND IT OVER AND SAY &quot;I TRUST THAT YOU WILL TAKE THIS.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:15.415" end="00:05:20.521">ESPECIALLY WITH SCIENCE FICTION WHICH HAS SO MANY BOUNDARIES AND RULES OF ENGAGEMENT THAT OCCUR </p>
<p begin="00:05:20.521" end="00:05:22.723">WITHIN THE UNIVERSES THAT YOU CREATE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.723" end="00:05:30.364">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT YOU&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT BUT THE THING IS....</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.364" end="00:05:36.403">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YES ON THE SHOW I SAID THE THAT JEWISH PUBIC HAIR WAS SIMILAR TO THE PLANET ENDOR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.403" end="00:05:39.740">AND I GOT A LETTER SAYING ENDOR&apos;S A MOON, YOU KNOW?</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.740" end="00:05:42.176">OH, DID I SAY PLANET?</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.176" end="00:05:45.179">SORRY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.179" end="00:05:47.114">PEOPLE ARE GOING PORE OVER IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.114" end="00:05:49.516">&gt;&gt; BUT IN TELEVISION WHAT&apos;S INTERESTING ABOUT IT IS PEOPLE </p>
<p begin="00:05:49.516" end="00:05:52.219">START TO FIND CONNECTIONS THAT YOU DIDN&apos;T EVEN KNOW EXISTED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.219" end="00:05:53.754">SO IT&apos;S A WEIRD THING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.754" end="00:05:56.657">YOU&apos;LL START TO HAVE AN IDEA AND YOU&apos;LL START TO DO SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.657" end="00:06:01.662">FOR ME IT WAS &quot;ALIENS.&quot; ... &quot;ALIAS.&quot; IT WAS UNBELIEVEIBLE THE </p>
<p begin="00:06:01.662" end="00:06:04.565">CONNECTIONS PEOPLE WERE MAKING TO THINGS WE DIDN&apos;T EVEN KNOW THERE WERE CONNECTIONS TO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.565" end="00:06:09.403">SO WE WOULD DECIDE SOMETIMES TO FOLLOW SOMETHING AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY &quot;OH, I READ THAT </p>
<p begin="00:06:09.403" end="00:06:10.671">ONLINE.&quot; WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.671" end="00:06:13.307">AND THEY WOULD SHOW ME THIS THING WHERE SOMEONE HAD ALREADY MADE A CONNECTION.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.307" end="00:06:15.876">SO IT&apos;S THIS WEIRD THING WHERE WHEN YOU&apos;RE DOING A SHOW YOU </p>
<p begin="00:06:15.876" end="00:06:18.078">HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT AS MUCH AS IT LISTENS TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.078" end="00:06:21.315">BUT THE VIEWERS SO SMART AND SOME HAVE A LOT OF TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.315" end="00:06:30.090">(LAUGHTER) AND THELT LITERALLY EXTRAPOLATE BASED ON WHERE YOU ARE &quot;OH, THEY </p>
<p begin="00:06:30.090" end="00:06:33.060">MUST BE RELATED.&quot; SO YOU&apos;RE IN THE WRITERS ROOM </p>
<p begin="00:06:33.060" end="00:06:37.497">AND THEY&apos;RE LIKE &quot;WHAT IF IT&apos;S HER FATHER?&quot; AND SOMEONE ELSE IS LIKE &quot;YOU </p>
<p begin="00:06:37.497" end="00:06:40.701">MEAN LIKE ALIAS FAN 7 WROTE?&quot; </p>

<p begin="00:06:42.469" end="00:06:45.606">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU ALIAS FAN 7:.</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.606" end="00:06:47.307">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL SO NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
