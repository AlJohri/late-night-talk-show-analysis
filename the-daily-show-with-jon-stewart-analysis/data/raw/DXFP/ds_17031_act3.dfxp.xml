<p begin="00:00:34.001" end="00:00:41.041">&gt;&gt; YOU SPEAK OF THE PEOPLE AS A GOD TO PUNISH, NOT MAN OF MERE INFIRMITY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.041" end="00:00:45.646">&gt;&gt; IT IS A MIND IN POISON WHERE IT IS NOT POISON ANY FURTHER.</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.746" end="00:01:24.218">MOST DARK, TRAGIC SHAKESPEAREAN PLAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.218" end="00:01:28.755">YOUR DECISION TO JUMP IN THAT DEEP A POND, HOW DO YOU COME TO THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.755" end="00:01:33.961">&gt;&gt; I PLAYED THE PART ON STAGE ABOUT 11 YEARS AGO, AND IT BECAME AN OBSESSION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.961" end="00:01:36.897">IT&apos;S A POLITICAL PARABLE, IF YOU LIKE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.897" end="00:01:44.972">IT&apos;S A TRAGEDY ABOUT... YOU SEE THE CRAZY SOLDIER WHO HAS NO TIME FOR POLITICIANS THAT CHANGE </p>
<p begin="00:01:44.972" end="00:01:45.606">THEIR MINDS.</p>

<p begin="00:01:53.614" end="00:01:54.248">&gt;&gt; SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.248" end="00:01:59.319">&gt;&gt; ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, PEOPLE ON THE STREETS, PEOPLE AT WAR AND POLITICIANS MANEUVERING AND </p>

<p begin="00:02:02.256" end="00:02:06.960">AT THE CENTER OF IT YOU HAVE THIS MOTHER/SON RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS THE THING THAT&apos;S ALWAYS </p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:07.961">MOVED ME ABOUT THE STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.961" end="00:02:10.864">&gt;&gt; AND IT&apos;S SHAKESPEARE, SO THERE HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT IN </p>
<p begin="00:02:10.864" end="00:02:12.699">THERE ABOUT THE MOTHER AND THE SON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.699" end="00:02:13.800">YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES.</p>

<p begin="00:02:16.970" end="00:02:24.778">IS IT... WHEN YOU... IT SEEMS TO FLOW SO EFFORTLESSLY FROM YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.778" end="00:02:31.418">DID IT... HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO PUT YOURSELF IN THOSE PLACES?</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.418" end="00:02:36.623">IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LANGUAGE THAT YOU FEEL... THE WAY THAT HE WRITES THAT SOMEHOW </p>
<p begin="00:02:36.623" end="00:02:40.561">YOU&apos;RE ABLE TO DO IT IN MANNER THAT SEEMS EFFORTLESS, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.561" end="00:02:42.196">AND THAT&apos;S OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE A CRAFT TO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.196" end="00:02:45.899">&gt;&gt; WELL, I&apos;VE HAD A CRACK AT A FEW SHAKESPEARE PARTS OVER THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:45.899" end="00:02:47.868">YEARS, AND YOU GET BETTER AT IT,</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.868" end="00:02:51.572">BUT I&apos;VE ALWAYS... IT&apos;S ALWAYS THRILLED ME EVER SINCE I WAS </p>
<p begin="00:02:51.572" end="00:02:55.976">YOUNG AND I HEARD RECORDINGS OF ACTORS DOING SHAKESPEARE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.976" end="00:02:59.112">SOMETHING ABOUT THE LANGUAGE HAD A KIND OF MAGIC FOR ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.112" end="00:03:02.783">BUT YOU NEED TO DO IT, AND I&apos;VE HAD GREAT OPPORTUNITIES DOING IT </p>
<p begin="00:03:02.783" end="00:03:07.788">ON STAGE AND I GUESS IT&apos;S BEEN A DREAM OR AN OBSESSION OF MINE TO </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.788" end="00:03:10.557">TAKE THIS &quot;CORIOLANUS&quot; INTO A FILM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.557" end="00:03:14.294">&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE THE ACTORS IN BRITAIN... LIKE IN THE STATES,</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.294" end="00:03:21.702">OUR ROLE MODELS ARE OBVIOUSLY STALLONE, SCHWARZENEGGER.</p>

<p begin="00:03:22.069" end="00:03:30.177">THE LANGUAGE IS LESS IMPORTANT NECESSARILY THAN WHAT WE WOULD CALL IN THIS COUNTRY &quot;THE BULK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.177" end="00:03:34.748">,&quot; &quot;THE HEFT.&quot; SO OUR ACTORS ARE TRAINED OBVIOUSLY BY POWER LIFTING.</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.859" end="00:03:49.830">WE&apos;RE IN THE ARMY WITH YOUR CHARACTER, BUT IS THAT SORT OF THE FIRST THING THAT EVERY </p>
<p begin="00:03:49.830" end="00:03:52.099">SCHOOL BOY LIKE IN BRITAIN TACKLES?</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.099" end="00:03:52.900">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.900" end="00:03:58.205">NO, I MEAN, I THINK FOR... FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE SHAKESPEARE IN SCHOOL IS REALLY A CHORE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.205" end="00:03:58.939">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.939" end="00:04:00.807">&gt;&gt; AND IT&apos;S HARD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.807" end="00:04:07.714">BUT I THINK WHEN IT WORKS AND WHEN I&apos;VE SEEN GREAT ACTORS DO IT AND INHABIT IT, IT CAN BE FANTASTIC.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.714" end="00:04:11.185">THERE&apos;S ALWAYS A LITTLE LEARNING CURVE, IF YOU LIKE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.185" end="00:04:17.824">THE FIRST ONE, I GO TO THE THEATER AND I SEE A SHAKESPEARE PLAY, I ALWAYS HAVE A MOMENT OF IJUDGMENT.</p>

<p begin="00:04:19.059" end="00:04:22.062">&gt;&gt; ABOUT TEN, 15 MINUTES, THEN MY EAR CLICKS IN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.062" end="00:04:24.565">I&apos;VE SEEN SOME WONDERFUL ACTORS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.565" end="00:04:26.466">VANESSA REDGRAVE IS IN THIS PLAYING MY MOTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.466" end="00:04:31.305">SHE&apos;S JUST EXTRAORDINARY AND HER EASE WITH THE LANGUAGE... YOU&apos;RE RIGHT IN THERE WITH IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.305" end="00:04:31.872">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.872" end="00:04:37.978">&gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT SOMETIMES THE LANGUAGE IS A CHALLENGE, BUT I HAVE HEARD </p>
<p begin="00:04:37.978" end="00:04:43.283">ACTORS DO IT AND INHABIT IT IN A WAY THAT I THINK IT... THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS TAKE ON THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:43.283" end="00:04:44.151">ANOTHER LEVEL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.151" end="00:04:46.153">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT ELEVATES IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.153" end="00:04:47.788">IT&apos;S LYRICAL, MUSICAL IN A WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.788" end="00:04:52.826">&gt;&gt; AND IT&apos;S VERY REWARDING WHEN... I DID THE SHAKESPEARE PLAY JUST NOW IN LONDON IN THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:52.826" end="00:04:55.395">WEST END, &quot;THE TEMPEST.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.395" end="00:05:00.501">&quot; AND PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AFTER AND SAY, I&apos;VE NEVER SEEN SHAKESPEARE BEFORE AND I LOVED </p>
