<p begin="00:00:13.680" end="00:00:19.653">A WAY THAT IS COHERENT AND MAKES SENSE AND EVERYTHING ELSE WILL BE UP ON THE WEB, SO, I MEAN, I </p>

<p begin="00:01:00.594" end="00:01:00.961">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.961" end="00:01:04.364">&gt;&gt; I CAN MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN YOUR CASE, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.364" end="00:01:08.402">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;VE SEEN THE &quot;DANCING WITH THE STARS&quot; CONTROVERSY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.402" end="00:01:16.143">SO FOR YOU, NOW OBVIOUSLY YOU WERE... YOU ARE STILL SPOKEN OF IN VERY I THINK ALMOST SACRED </p>
<p begin="00:01:16.143" end="00:01:22.749">TERMS AS THE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE GOVERNOR THAT COULD SAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THAT </p>
<p begin="00:01:22.749" end="00:01:23.684">COULD BE PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.684" end="00:01:30.157">A WOMAN IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE YOU TO BE PRESIDENT OR AT LEAST VICE PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.157" end="00:01:34.127">&gt;&gt; Jon: </p>
<p begin="00:01:34.127" end="00:01:37.197">&gt;&gt; ONE WOMAN?</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.197" end="00:01:38.465">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S OUR AUDIENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.465" end="00:01:42.236">I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.236" end="00:01:44.505">[FIVE MINUTES LATER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.505" end="00:01:49.610">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE TROUBLE WITH THE PLAN, THEY KEEP SAYING, THE GOVERNMENT IS OUT OF CONTROL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.610" end="00:01:52.212">THEY&apos;RE SPENDING MORE THAN THEY TAKE IN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.212" end="00:01:53.447">THEY&apos;RE CRAZY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.447" end="00:01:54.781">THEY&apos;RE LIKE DRUNKEN SAILORS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.781" end="00:01:56.149">BUT WHEN THEY WERE IN CHARGE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.149" end="00:02:01.488">THEY HAD AN UNPAID-FOR MEDICAID BILL OF A TRILLION DOLLARS, THEY HAD TWO WARS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.488" end="00:02:04.324">THEY DIDN&apos;T RAISE TAXES DURING TWO WARS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.324" end="00:02:06.159">THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEFICIT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.159" end="00:02:08.495">USING THAT STUDY THAT I HAVE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.495" end="00:02:10.330">AND WE HAVE IT TO PUT UP, PEW,</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.330" end="00:02:14.268">WHATEVER THE NAME OF THAT RESEARCH CENTER IS, THE 2001,</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.268" end="00:02:17.938">2003 TAX CUTS RESPONSIBLE FOR $1.7 TRILLION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.938" end="00:02:26.813">THE IRAQ WARS, APPARENTLY THE STIMULUS AND ALL THAT WAS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR $700 BILLION OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.813" end="00:02:31.752">IT&apos;S HARD TO LISTEN TO THOSE FOLKS AND TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY BECAUSE WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE </p>
<p begin="00:02:31.752" end="00:02:35.088">THEY&apos;RE SAYING, &quot;WE NEED TO STOP SPENDING WHEN DEMOCRATS ARE IN </p>
<p begin="00:02:35.088" end="00:02:40.494">CHARGE, BUT WHEN PRINCE ARE IN CHARGE, WE NEED TO JUST DO WHATEVER WE DO.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:02:40.494" end="00:02:46.099">&gt;&gt; AFTER 9/11, I FORGOT THIS AND SOMEBODY SENT ME A COPY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.099" end="00:02:49.469">I WENT TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND SAID, LOOK </p>
<p begin="00:02:49.469" end="00:02:50.938">HOW MUCH SPENDING WAS CUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.938" end="00:02:52.906">IF WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE IN THE WAR,</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.906" end="00:02:57.244">THEN OTHER PRIORITIES OUGHT TO BE POSTPONED FOR A WHILE, AND THAT&apos;S WHAT HARRY TRUMAN DID </p>
<p begin="00:02:57.244" end="00:03:03.917">WHEN WE WENT INTO KOREA, WHAT F.D.R. DID WHEN WE WENT INTO WORLD WAR II, AND IT&apos;S VERY FAIR </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.917" end="00:03:07.588">TO SAY, REPUBLICANS WERE IN CONGRESS, I GOT NOWHERE WITH THAT ARGUMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.588" end="00:03:08.555">YOU&apos;RE QUITE CORRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.555" end="00:03:10.424">THE COSTS WERE ADDED ON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.424" end="00:03:15.462">I&apos;M JUST SAYING THAT WHEN YOU LOOK FORWARD AT THE PROBLEMS THAT ALARM ME, AND I REALLY </p>
<p begin="00:03:15.462" end="00:03:20.968">BELIEVE SHOULD ALARM EVERY AMERICAN WHO CARES ABOUT THE AMERICAN PROMISE OF UPWARD </p>
<p begin="00:03:20.968" end="00:03:25.606">MOBILITY THAT&apos;S AT THE HEART OF THIS COUNTRY, THEN RELIT GAITING </p>
<p begin="00:03:25.606" end="00:03:27.841">THAT IS NOT GOING TO GET US VERY FAR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.841" end="00:03:32.179">THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT STEPS CAN WE TAKE TO...</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.179" end="00:03:33.714">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S A FAIR POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.714" end="00:03:37.551">WHEN WE COME BACK THEN WE&apos;LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE AND WE </p>
<p begin="00:03:37.551" end="00:03:41.688">WON&apos;T RE-LITIGATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.688" end="00:03:42.222">WE&apos;LL BE </p>
