<p begin="00:03:11.091" end="00:03:13.060">APPARENTLY SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN BOEHNER WAS LITERALLY NOT EATING HIS PEAS.</p>

<p begin="00:03:38.085" end="00:03:42.656">WHAT&apos;S INTERESTING IS THE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY&apos;RE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NEGOTIATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.656" end="00:03:45.692">&gt;&gt; MOST AMERICANS WOULD SAY A BALANCED APPROACH IS A SIMPLE ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.692" end="00:03:51.265">THE ADMINISTRATION GETS ITS DEBT LIMIT INCREASE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET THEIR SPENDING CUTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.265" end="00:03:52.833">AND THEIR REFORMS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.833" end="00:03:54.168">&gt;&gt; Jon: WAIT, WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.168" end="00:03:55.802">YOU SEE THE PROBLEM?</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.802" end="00:03:59.439">THE ADMINISTRATION GETS ITS DEBT LIMIT INCREASE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.439" end="00:04:02.309">THE ARBITRARY SPENDING LIMIT,</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.309" end="00:04:05.712">WHICH CONGRESS HAS RELEASED TEN TIMES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.712" end="00:04:07.748">NOW THAT&apos;S THE BIG GIVE IN THE NEGOTIATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.748" end="00:04:12.052">IT&apos;S NOT, ALL RIGHT, LET&apos;S ALL CHIP IN AND BUY A GETTING FOR THE PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.052" end="00:04:15.489">IT&apos;S BUY ME A KEG AND I WON&apos;T BURN YOUR [BLEEPED] HOUSE DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.489" end="00:04:20.060">NOW, WHY WOULD OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRATS GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THAT&apos;S NOT REALLY A GIVE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.060" end="00:04:23.330">&gt;&gt; NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT NOT RAISING THE DEBT CEILING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.330" end="00:04:26.500">I HAVEN&apos;T HEARD THAT DISCUSSED BY ANYBODY, NOT IN THE CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.500" end="00:04:29.903">YEAH, NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT DOING THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.903" end="00:04:34.241">&gt;&gt; Jon: [WHISPERING] THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.241" end="00:04:37.611">SEE, THE LEADER OF THE SENATE REPUBLICANS STATED ON SUNDAY THAT OF COURSE THEY&apos;RE GOING TO </p>
<p begin="00:04:37.611" end="00:04:38.879">RAISE THE DEBT CEILING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.879" end="00:04:42.916">NOW, WHY WOULD THE REPUBLICANS GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY CAN PLAY SILLY POLITICS WITH </p>
<p begin="00:04:42.916" end="00:04:45.118">SOMETHING LIKE OUR CREDIT RATING?</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.118" end="00:04:50.824">BECAUSE IN 2006 THE PRESIDENT AND FRESHMAN SENATOR VOTED AGAINST RAISING THE DEBT CEILING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.824" end="00:04:52.693">AND WHY DID HE DO THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.693" end="00:05:01.468">&gt;&gt; THAT WAS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF A NEW SENATOR, YOU KNOW, MAKING WHAT IS A POLITICAL VOTE AS </p>
<p begin="00:05:01.468" end="00:05:06.507">OPPOSED TO DOING WHAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY, AND I&apos;M THE FIRST ONE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT.</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.790" end="00:05:25.158">BUT HERE&apos;S THE WORST PART.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.158" end="00:05:30.764">THE REPUBLICAN INSISTENCE ON MAKING THE DEBT CEILING THEIR GIVE AS OPPOSED TO INCREASED TAX </p>
<p begin="00:05:30.764" end="00:05:34.401">REVENUES, DOESN&apos;T APPEAR TO BE A CYNICAL POLITICAL PLOY.</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.779" end="00:05:48.248">&gt;&gt; Jon: HIGHER TAXES ON JOB CREATORS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.248" end="00:05:49.883">WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.883" end="00:05:54.588">IT&apos;S LIKE A DOCTOR CONSULTING WITH A PATIENT WHO BELIEVES STRICTLY IN MAGIC.</p>
