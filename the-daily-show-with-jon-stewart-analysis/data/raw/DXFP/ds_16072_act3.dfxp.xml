<p begin="00:00:11.879" end="00:00:18.252">HE CHRONICLES HIS TIME SPENT AS A PRISONER IN AN IRANIAN JAIL, A FAMILY STORY OF LOVE,</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.252" end="00:00:21.221">CAPTIVE CAPTIVITY AND SURVIVAL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.221" end="00:00:22.556">PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.556" end="00:00:34.568">MAZIAR BAHARI.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.568" end="00:00:35.335">&gt;&gt; YOU START.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.335" end="00:00:38.639">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE VERY KIND.</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.208" end="00:00:42.309">NICELY DONE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.309" end="00:00:43.110">HOW ARE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.110" end="00:00:44.178">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M FINE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.178" end="00:00:48.081">BUT BEFORE WE START I&apos;D LIKE TO GET SOMETHING OFF MY CHEST.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.081" end="00:00:51.518">YOU KNOW, LAST TIME I CAME HERE, YOU KNOW, WE WERE JOKING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.518" end="00:00:55.122">I SAID THAT YOU GOT ME IN JAIL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.122" end="00:00:56.857">IMMEDIATELY I SAID I&apos;M KIDDING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.857" end="00:00:57.991">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DID SAY THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.991" end="00:00:59.793">&gt;&gt; THEN ON BLOGS AND, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.793" end="00:01:04.064">IN PAPERS I SAW THAT PRISON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.064" end="00:01:12.139">I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MY IMPRISONMENT, MY ARREST.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.139" end="00:01:16.076">THOSE GUYS, I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.076" end="00:01:19.213">&gt;&gt; Jon: WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE ON THIS SHOW, YOUNG MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.213" end="00:01:21.215">&gt;&gt; I DIDN&apos;T KNOW IF I SHOULD SAY THAT OR NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.215" end="00:01:23.450">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS A VERY CLASSY OPERATION WE RUN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.450" end="00:01:25.252">&gt;&gt; THOSE GUYS WHO ARRESTED ME,</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.252" end="00:01:28.222">THEY WANTEDED TO FABRICATE CHARGES AGAINST ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.222" end="00:01:28.789">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.789" end="00:01:38.098">&gt;&gt; I COULD BE IN SESAME STREET AND THEY WOULD ACCUSE ELMO OF SEDITION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.098" end="00:01:40.267">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE JUST BROKEN A STORY, MY FRIEND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.267" end="00:01:42.236">WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, ELMO?</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.236" end="00:01:48.642">&gt;&gt; I COULD BE TWO-AND-A-HALF MEN AND THEY COULD ACCUSE ME OF COOPERATING WITH WHAT&apos;S HIS NAME?</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.642" end="00:01:49.610">CHARLIE SHEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.610" end="00:01:50.444">&gt;&gt; Jon: EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.444" end="00:01:51.912">&gt;&gt; AND CORRUPTING THE EARTH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.912" end="00:01:54.214">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.214" end="00:01:55.415">I FEEL MUCH BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.415" end="00:02:00.187">HE&apos;S REFERRING TO WHEN HE WAS IN IRAN, WE SENT JASON JONES THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.187" end="00:02:05.158">HE INTERVIEW MAZIAR BAHARI IN A CAFE AND JASON PRETENDED TO BE SPY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.158" end="00:02:10.531">WHILE YOU WERE IN PRISON THEY SHOWED A TAPE OF THAT TO YOU AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING TO A SPY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.531" end="00:02:14.968">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE JASON LOOKED LIKE A SPY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.968" end="00:02:16.069">ACTED LIKE A SPY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.069" end="00:02:17.070">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.070" end="00:02:20.073">&gt;&gt; I GUESS HE TASTED LIKE A SPY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.073" end="00:02:21.141">TO THEY SAY HE&apos;S A SPY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.141" end="00:02:28.682">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE THING IS THEY PROBABLY NEVER EXPLAINED IS WHY WOULD A SPY DO THAT ON TELEVISION?</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.682" end="00:02:31.985">&gt;&gt; AND WHY THERE ARE LAUGH TRACKS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.985" end="00:02:35.722">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE LAUGHTER IS REAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.722" end="00:02:40.561">(  <span tts:fontStyle="italic">CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</span> LET ME ASK YOU, FIRST OF ALL,</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.561" end="00:02:42.796">THIS REALLY IS IS AN INCREDIBLE STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.796" end="00:02:45.365">I WANT TO SHOW THIS RIGHT HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.365" end="00:02:46.834">THEN THEY CAME FOR ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.834" end="00:02:47.301">A FAMILY STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.301" end="00:02:54.274">WHAT&apos;S INCREDIBLE IS IS YOUR FATHER IN THE 1950s WAS ARRESTED BY THE SHAW&apos;S PEOPLE </p>
<p begin="00:02:54.274" end="00:02:57.744">BECAUSE HE BELONGED TO WHAT WAS CALLED THE TUDA PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.744" end="00:02:59.279">&gt;&gt; THE COMMUNIST PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.279" end="00:03:02.649">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOUR SISTER WAS ARRESTED....</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.649" end="00:03:03.884">&gt;&gt; IN THE 1980s.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.884" end="00:03:08.288">&gt;&gt; Jon: IN THE 1980s UNDER KHOMEINI.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.288" end="00:03:09.323">THE SAME THING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.323" end="00:03:11.692">YOUR FAMILY HAS FACED THIS HISTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.692" end="00:03:21.368">HOW DOES A FAMILY STAY AT A CERTAIN POINT IN THE COUNTRY AND PUT UP WITH THAT SORT OF </p>
<p begin="00:03:21.368" end="00:03:24.738">SWORD HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS ALL THE TIME?</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.738" end="00:03:30.410">&gt;&gt; THE STORY OF MY FAMILY IS VERY TYPICAL OF MANY IRANIAN FAMILIES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:37.117">MANY IRANIAN FAMILIES WENT THROUGH EVEN WORSE STORIES THAN MY FAMILY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.117" end="00:03:41.855">MY FATHER AND MY SISTER, THEY BOTH BELIEVED IN AN IDEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.855" end="00:03:43.323">THEY WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.323" end="00:03:46.793">THEY WANTED A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEIR COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.793" end="00:03:48.328">AND THEY FOUGHT FOR THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.328" end="00:03:51.231">THEY HAD TO PAY FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.231" end="00:03:55.269">&gt;&gt; Jon: BOTH TORTURED ALSO IN PRISON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.269" end="00:03:55.636">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.636" end="00:03:59.706">MY FATHER WAS TORTURED BY THE SHAH&apos;S REGIME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.706" end="00:04:05.746">HE SPENT FOUR YEARS IN SHAH&apos;S PRISONS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.746" end="00:04:07.314">HIS TOENAILS WERE DAMAGED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.314" end="00:04:09.249">HE COULDN&apos;T WALK PROPERLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.249" end="00:04:15.622">MY SISTER SPENT SIX YEARS IN THE &apos;80s IN KHOMEINI&apos;S REGIME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.622" end="00:04:18.258">SHE HAD MOCK EXECUTION AND WENT THROUGH TORTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.258" end="00:04:24.064">THIS IS A TYPICAL IRANIAN FAMILY STORY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY NEVER GAVE UP HOPE </p>
<p begin="00:04:24.064" end="00:04:25.866">ABOUT THE FUTURE OF IRAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.866" end="00:04:29.570">AND THE FUTURE... THE FUTURE OF A BETTER IRAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.570" end="00:04:32.506">THEY ALWAYS FOUGHT FOR A BETTER IRAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.506" end="00:04:33.473">THEY INSPIREDED ME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.473" end="00:04:39.613">WHILE I WAS IN PRISON WHEN THEY ARRESTED ME IN 2009, WHEN I WAS IN PRISON I WAS INSPIRED </p>
<p begin="00:04:39.613" end="00:04:41.415">BY THE MEMORY OF MY FAMILY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.415" end="00:04:43.917">BY THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER AND MY SISTER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.917" end="00:04:49.089">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU WRITE ABOUT ALSO FEELING THE PRESSURE TO LIVE UP TO THEM BECAUSE THEY HAD </p>
<p begin="00:04:49.089" end="00:04:51.692">BEEN SO BRAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.692" end="00:04:57.197">DID THAT WEIGH ON YOU OR DID THAT ALSO GIVE YOU STRENGTH?</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.197" end="00:05:05.572">&gt;&gt; IT BOTH... IT WAS... IT GAVE ME A STRENGTH BECAUSE I TALKED A LOT TO MY FATHER AND </p>
<p begin="00:05:05.572" end="00:05:08.408">MY SISTER ABOUT THEIR TIME IN PRISON.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.408" end="00:05:15.382">WHEN I CAME OUT OF PRISON A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKED ME HOW COME YOU&apos;RE RELATIVELY UNSCATHED?</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.382" end="00:05:17.918">YOU LOOK AT THIS UNSCATHED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.918" end="00:05:23.824">THAT WAS MAINLY BECAUSE OF MY IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH MY FATHER AND MY SISTER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.824" end="00:05:25.125">AND BECAUSE THEIR MEMORIES,</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.125" end="00:05:28.295">THEIR LOVE, IT GAVE ME INSPIRATION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.295" end="00:05:32.065">YOU KNOW, I&apos;VE NEVER BEEN A SPIRITUAL PERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.065" end="00:05:39.840">YOU KNOW, I NEVER WATCHED OPRAH, YOU KNOW, LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:46.813">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID NOT THINK YOU WERE GOING THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.813" end="00:05:47.381">(LAUGHING) </p>
<p begin="00:05:47.381" end="00:05:49.449">&gt;&gt; BUT WHEN I WAS IN PRISON,</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.449" end="00:05:53.654">YOU KNOW, I SPENT 107 DAYS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.654" end="00:06:01.461">IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT I HAD TO TAP INSIDE MY INNER RESOURCES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.461" end="00:06:07.234">MY INNER RESOURCES WERE MY MEMORIES OF MY FAMILY, MY FATHER, SISTER, AND ALSO THE </p>
<p begin="00:06:07.234" end="00:06:08.869">BIGGER MEMORIES OF CULTURE,</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.869" end="00:06:13.040">HISTORY, MUSIC WHICH I EXPLAIN IN THE BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.040" end="00:06:16.076">THAT WAS, TO ME, IT WAS A VERY SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.076" end="00:06:16.844">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.844" end="00:06:20.948">&gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH I NEVER JOINED A CULT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.948" end="00:06:23.750">&gt;&gt; Jon: IF ONLY THEY HAD GOTTEN YOU AT THE RIGHT TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.750" end="00:06:24.284">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.284" end="00:06:27.354">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S SO, I THINK, INCREDIBLE ABOUT THIS BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.354" end="00:06:31.491">THIS IS NOT TO MINIMIZE OTHER PEOPLE&apos;S EXPERIENCES BECAUSE I&apos;VE READ, THERE HAVE BEEN </p>
<p begin="00:06:31.491" end="00:06:37.364">SOME MEMOIRS OF JOURNALISTS OR OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED IN TOTALITARIAN </p>
<p begin="00:06:37.364" end="00:06:38.732">REGIMES AND OTHER PLACES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.732" end="00:06:43.637">YOUR ABILITY TO CONNECT IT TO YOUR FAMILY AND JUST THE NUANCES OF WHAT YOU PICK UP </p>
<p begin="00:06:43.637" end="00:06:44.805">EVEN FROM YOUR CAPTORS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.805" end="00:06:49.643">YOU KNOW, YOU TALK ABOUT THIS FELLOW ROSEWATER THAT WAS YOUR INTERROGATOR AND YOUR TORTURER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.643" end="00:06:53.413">HIS FATHER HAD ALSO BEEN IN PRISON.</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.413" end="00:07:00.621">IT&apos;S SUCH AN INTERESTING SYNCHRONICITY THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO REMEMBER.</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.621" end="00:07:05.492">HOW DID YOU KEEP THESE THINGS IN YOUR MIND TO BE ABLE TO CHRONICLE THEM?</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.492" end="00:07:08.562">&gt;&gt; THE THING IS THAT WHEN YOU&apos;RE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE,</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.562" end="00:07:12.199">YOU HAVE TO CREATE AN INNER UNIVERSE FOR YOURSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.199" end="00:07:16.503">YOU HAVE TO SHIELD YOURSELF INSIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.503" end="00:07:21.375">SO YOU HAVE THE PHYSICAL PRESSURE AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.375" end="00:07:25.312">BUT THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE YOU THAT YOU KEEP INTACT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.312" end="00:07:34.388">WHEN SOMEONE IS CHARGING YOU WITH SUCH EXAGGERATED ACCUSATIONS LIKE, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.388" end="00:07:37.591">MOST OF YOUR AUDIENCE DON&apos;T KNOW....</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.591" end="00:07:39.793">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE&apos;RE GOING TO GO TO A COMMERCIAL.</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.793" end="00:07:45.165">BEFORE WE GO, I DO WANT TO SAY IN THE SPIRIT OF FULL DISCLOSURE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.165" end="00:07:48.468">THIS IS HOW IMPRESSED I AM WITH THIS MAN&apos;S STORY AND HIS COURAGE IN THIS BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.468" end="00:07:51.839">YOU AND I ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON A FILM ABOUT THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.839" end="00:07:58.679">THAT WE&apos;RE GOING TO USE AND I&apos;VE SUGGESTED OBVIOUSLY MATT DAMON AS YOU.</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.849" end="00:08:05.419">&gt;&gt; I WAS THINKING ABOUT WILL SMITH.</p>
