<p begin="00:02:20.741" end="00:02:25.712">AND THE THING THAT WAS SO INTERESTING TO ME THAT LED ME TO DO THIS THING IS YOU THINK OF </p>
<p begin="00:02:25.712" end="00:02:28.582">THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND YOU THINK OF IT AS ONE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.582" end="00:02:30.751">LIKE THE SAME THING HAPPENED EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.751" end="00:02:33.086">AND THE SAME CAUSE HAPPENED EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.086" end="00:02:37.291">IT WAS A PILE OF MONEY WAS LEFT IN A DARK ROOM AND THE PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO DO WHATEVER THEY </p>
<p begin="00:02:37.291" end="00:02:39.159">WANTED WITH IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.159" end="00:02:40.527">TODAY... EVERYBODY FACES THE SAME TEMPTATION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.527" end="00:02:42.963">THE BANKS WERE WILLING TO LEND TO ANYBODY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.963" end="00:02:48.435">BUT WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND THE MONEY FOR ME BECAME A </p>
<p begin="00:02:48.435" end="00:02:50.404">PRISM THROUGH WHICH TO VIEW THE SOCIETY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.404" end="00:02:52.606">IT WAS LIKE A WHEN DOE INTO THE SOCIETY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.606" end="00:02:57.110">THEY EXPRESSED KIND OF DEEP CULTURAL TRAITS THROUGH HOW THEY BEHAVED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.110" end="00:02:59.813">SO I WANDERED THE WORLD AND DESCRIBED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.813" end="00:03:02.416">AND THE STUFF THAT HAPPENED DPS I MAY GO ON A BIT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.416" end="00:03:03.050">&gt;&gt; Jon: PLEASE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.050" end="00:03:08.188">&gt;&gt; SO THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE WERE SO INTERESTING BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THE... EACH </p>
<p begin="00:03:08.188" end="00:03:10.490">WAS PECULIAR BUT EACH SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.490" end="00:03:13.594">IN THE END THE BOOK WAS ALWAYS GOING TO COME BACK TO THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.594" end="00:03:14.795">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT&apos;S INTERESTING IS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.795" end="00:03:17.130">YOU KNOW, YOU SEE... YOU&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT GREECE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:24.571">GREECE WAS A SITUATION WHERE THE STATE REALLY DESTROYED THE BANKS AND ICELAND IS SORT OF THE OPPOSITE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.571" end="00:03:26.707">THE BANKS DESTROYED THE STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.707" end="00:03:28.242">THE BANKERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.242" end="00:03:32.980">AND IRELAND JUST SEEMED LIKE A SITUATION WHERE THEY EXPECTED IT AND THEY&apos;RE JUST NOW... NOW </p>
<p begin="00:03:32.980" end="00:03:36.083">THEY&apos;RE JUST GOING &quot;YEAH, I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.&quot; (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:03:36.083" end="00:03:37.251">AND THEY&apos;RE SUCKING IT UP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.251" end="00:03:40.621">&gt;&gt; THE IRISH HAVE A TALENT FOR SUFFERING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.621" end="00:03:41.855">(LAUGHTER) THEY WERE WAITING FOR THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.855" end="00:03:45.158">I MEAN, ANYBODY WHO&apos;S BEEN IN A ROOM FULL OF IRISH PEOPLE, THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:45.158" end="00:03:50.931">STATUS GOES TO THE PERSON WHO&apos;S HAD THE WORST THING HAPPEN TO THEM MOST RECENTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.931" end="00:03:54.101">(LAUGHTER) AND SO THEY&apos;VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT TO COMPETE WITH EACH </p>
<p begin="00:03:54.101" end="00:03:56.503">OTHER FOR HOW BAD THEY HAVE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.503" end="00:03:58.939">AND... BUT THE STORIES ARE INCREDIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.939" end="00:04:02.409">ICELAND IS A NATION OF 300,000 PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.409" end="00:04:03.844">THE SIZE OF PEORIA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.844" end="00:04:11.118">THEY TOOK THEIR THREE LITTLE BANKS AND TURNED THEM INTO THREE GLOBAL BANKS THAT HAD ALL </p>
<p begin="00:04:11.118" end="00:04:13.921">TOGETHER $140 BILLION WORTH OF ASSETS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.921" end="00:04:18.725">ICELAND... THE WAY IT MADE ITS MONEY UP UNTIL SEVEN YEARS AGO WAS FISHING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.725" end="00:04:21.361">THAT&apos;S WHAT YOU COULD DO IN ICELAND TO MAKE MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.361" end="00:04:26.466">PEOPLE WERE LITERALLY WASHING OFF OF FISHING BOATS AND BECOMING CURRENCY TRADERS IN DAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.466" end="00:04:27.768">A MATTER OF DAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.768" end="00:04:32.105">AND THEY TOLD THEMSELVES THAT THEY WERE GOOD AT THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.105" end="00:04:37.177">THEIR PRESIDENT WAS WANDERING THE WORLD SAYING ICELANDERS WERE NATURALLY SUITED TO BECOME HEDGE </p>
<p begin="00:04:37.177" end="00:04:41.949">FUND PEOPLE AND THEY HAD THIS NATURAL GIFT THAT SOMEHOW HADN&apos;T EXPRESSED ITSELF FOR A THOUSAND </p>

<p begin="00:04:43.450" end="00:04:45.919">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THEY WERE KILLING IT FOR THOSE FIRST COUPLE YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:47.721">&gt;&gt; FOR FIVE YEARS THEY WERE GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.721" end="00:04:50.090">THEN THEY LOST $100 BILLION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.090" end="00:04:50.557">(AUDIENCE REACTS).</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.557" end="00:04:51.225">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT HAPPENS!</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.225" end="00:04:53.093">&gt;&gt; IT HAPPENS, YES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.093" end="00:04:53.393">&gt;&gt; Jon: .</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.393" end="00:04:54.494">&gt;&gt; AND IT WAS THE MEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.494" end="00:04:56.997">IT WAS JUST THE MEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.997" end="00:05:01.034">THE MEN FISHED AND THE MEN MOVED OFF THE FISHING BOATS INTO THE BANKS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.034" end="00:05:02.870">AND THE WOMEN... YOU COULD SEE WHAT HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.870" end="00:05:06.440">THE MEN SAID TO THEIR WIVES &quot;I MOW WHAT I&apos;M DOING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.440" end="00:05:09.877">I KNOW WHAT I&apos;M DOING HERE.&quot; (LAUGHTER) &quot;I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING THERE,</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.877" end="00:05:13.146">YOU NEVER ASKED ME ABOUT THE FISH, DON&apos;T ASK ME ABOUT THE MONEY.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:13.146" end="00:05:15.849">AND THEY WENT AND DID THIS STUFF AND THE WOMEN WENT &quot;ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.849" end="00:05:19.620">LOOKS LIKE IT&apos;S GOING ALL RIGHT.&quot; THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE&apos;RE LOST.</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.055" end="00:05:26.627">AND WHAT&apos;S HAPPENED SINCE, IT CREATED... THE MEN HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT OF THE BANKS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.627" end="00:05:28.762">WOMEN HAVE GONE IN TO RUN THE BANKS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.762" end="00:05:29.830">THEY GOT RID OF THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.830" end="00:05:34.401">THEY HAVE THE FIRST LESBIAN HEAD OF STATE MAKING... MAKING SOME KIND OF POINT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.401" end="00:05:38.172">THE WOMEN HAVE SAID &quot;YOU DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT YOU&apos;RE DOING.&quot; (LAUGHTER) </p>
