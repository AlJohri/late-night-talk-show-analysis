<p begin="00:01:42.769" end="00:01:44.872">I WENT AND SAW THIS FILM LAST NIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.872" end="00:01:51.645">I DON&apos;T NORMALLY DO THAT BECAUSE I DON&apos;T NORMALLY RESPECT MY GUESTS (  LAUGHTER  ) </p>
<p begin="00:01:51.645" end="00:01:53.113">IT&apos;S A BEAUTIFUL FILM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.113" end="00:01:59.520">NOT THE BODY COUNT THAT I NORMALLY LIKE TO SEE IN ONE OF YOUR FILMS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:07.794">BUT A BEAUTIFUL-- JUST A REALLY WONDERFUL, LOVELY ODE-- A LOVE LETTER ALMOST TO FILM MAKING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.794" end="00:02:09.263">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S PART OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.263" end="00:02:16.904">OF COURSE THE BOY WHO IS 12 YEARS OLD, ASSA BUTTERFIELD,</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.904" end="00:02:18.372">LIVING IN PARIS IN 1931.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.372" end="00:02:25.913">THIS ISOLATED KID GETS INVOLVED WITH THE OLDER GENTLEMAN YOU SAW PLAYED BY BEN KINGSLEY, WHO </p>
<p begin="00:02:25.913" end="00:02:29.149">TURNS OUT TO BE GEORGE MELIER,</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.149" end="00:02:32.319">ONE OF THE GREAT PIONEERS OF CINEMA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:35.722">HE DID HAVE A TOY STORE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.722" end="00:02:41.895">16 YEARS AFTER HIS LIFE HAD BEEN DESTROYED, AFTER HE CREATED EVERYTHING WE DO NOW IN CINEMA,</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.895" end="00:02:45.399">FROM JIM CAMERON, SPIELBERG,</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.399" end="00:02:48.635">LUCAS, ALL COMES FROM WHAT HE DID.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.635" end="00:02:49.937">IT DOES HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.937" end="00:02:52.372">&gt;&gt; Jon:  IT HAS A WONDERFUL ENDING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.372" end="00:02:58.545">I DIDN&apos;T REALIZE BECAUSE IT HAS SO MANY FANTASTIC AND FANTASTICAL ELEMENTS BUT I </p>
<p begin="00:02:58.545" end="00:03:00.614">GRABBED A LITTLE WIKIPEDIA TODAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.614" end="00:03:03.050">IT&apos;S A TRUE STORY (  LAUGHTER  ).</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.050" end="00:03:04.251">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.251" end="00:03:06.286">HE MADE ABOUT 500 FILMS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.286" end="00:03:17.097">WHEN THEY FOUND HIM AT THE STATION, 1928,, &quot;THEY SAID YOU LOOK LIKE MELUOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.097" end="00:03:21.101">HE SAID I AM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.101" end="00:03:25.305">HE LOST MOST OF HIS FINANCING WHEN THE BIGGER COMPANIES CAME IN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.305" end="00:03:30.244">WHAT HAPPENED EDISON, HERE, ALSO AT THAT TIME, THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON WITH COPYRIGHT AND THAT </p>
<p begin="00:03:30.244" end="00:03:31.111">SORT OF THING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.111" end="00:03:36.950">BUT IN ANY EVENT, THEY SAID-- THEY TOOK HIM IN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.950" end="00:03:40.654">THEY-- HE WAS FETTED EVERYWHERE AROUND THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.654" end="00:03:42.422">I THINK HE DIED IN 1938.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.422" end="00:03:45.993">HE WAS HOPING TO COME TO HOLLYWOOD TO WORK ON A FANTASY FILM IN HOLLYWOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.993" end="00:03:46.960">&gt;&gt; Jon:  THAT&apos;S TREMENDOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.960" end="00:03:52.900">THERE&apos;S A STORY EDISON HAD TAKEN ONE OF HIS FILMS AND SHOWED IT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.900" end="00:03:58.672">AND IT BECAME ENORMOUSLY POPULAR IN AMERICA BUT EDISON DECIDED NOT TO PAY-- I GUESS WHAT WE </p>
<p begin="00:03:58.672" end="00:04:00.240">WOULD CALL IN THESE DAYS,</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.240" end="00:04:00.807">ROYALTIES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.807" end="00:04:02.242">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT, THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.242" end="00:04:08.849">SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT HE-- THE FILM, I THINK WAS THE FAMOUS ONE, &quot;A TRIP TO THE MOON.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:04:08.849" end="00:04:10.717">&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHEN THE MOON GET HIT IN THE EYE-- </p>
<p begin="00:04:10.717" end="00:04:13.353">&gt;&gt; THEY WERE JUST TAKING THE FILMS AND MAKING DUPEES OF THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.353" end="00:04:17.391">THAT&apos;S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE WAS FINISHED FINANCIALLY,</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.391" end="00:04:17.791">ULTIMATELY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.791" end="00:04:22.529">&gt;&gt; Jon:  IN SOME WAYS EDISON, ALSO THE INVENTOR OF THE PHONOGRAPH AND ALL THOSE THINGS,</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.529" end="00:04:25.532">INVENTED PIRATING MOVIES (  LAUGHTER  ).</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.532" end="00:04:26.133">&gt;&gt; OH, YES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.133" end="00:04:28.368">IT&apos;S A GREAT IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.368" end="00:04:32.072">IF YOU WANT TO SEE A FILM, PUT A NICKEL IN HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.072" end="00:04:33.507">&gt;&gt; Jon:  THAT&apos;S WHAT I&apos;M TALKING ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.507" end="00:04:38.912">THIS IS A 3D MOVIE IS THIS YOUR FIRST 3D.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.912" end="00:04:39.446">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.446" end="00:04:42.082">&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU PITCHED THE IDEA TO THE STUDIOS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.082" end="00:04:45.185">YOU SAID I HAVE AN IDEA FAIR MOVIE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.185" end="00:04:47.988">IT&apos;S A 3D MOVIE INSIDE OF A CLOCK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.988" end="00:04:50.390">&gt;&gt; BUT IT LOOKS GREAT INSIDE OF THE CLOCK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.390" end="00:04:52.960">I WENT UP THERE AND THOSE-- THAT&apos;S WHAT IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:53.861">THAT&apos;S WHAT IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.861" end="00:04:54.494">IT&apos;S AMAZING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.494" end="00:05:02.603">I MEAN, WE AMPLIFIED SOMEWHAT BASED ON BRIAN&apos;S BOOK, BRIAN SELZNICK.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.603" end="00:05:04.771">FIVE YEARS I WAS GOING TO MAKE THE PICTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.771" end="00:05:07.808">THINGS DIDN&apos;T TURN OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.808" end="00:05:10.410">MY WIFE READ THE BOOK AND SAID,</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.410" end="00:05:15.182">&quot;IT&apos;S FOR YOU.&quot; IN THE MEANTIME-- IN THE MEANTIME-- 12 YEARS AGO (  LAUGHTER  ) </p>
<p begin="00:05:15.182" end="00:05:17.784">WE HAD A LITTLE GIRL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.784" end="00:05:21.488">IN THE MEANTIME, ALL THIS TIME-- WHEN THE KIDS COME, THEY&apos;RE SMALL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.488" end="00:05:23.323">&gt;&gt; Jon:  BUT THEY&apos;RE NOT HAMPSTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.323" end="00:05:25.659">&gt;&gt; NO, BUT THAT&apos;S THE POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.659" end="00:05:26.326">THEY GROW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.326" end="00:05:28.295">WHEN THEY GROW, YOU KNOW, THEY START TO WALK.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.295" end="00:05:29.596">THEY START TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.596" end="00:05:30.864">START TO TALK TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.864" end="00:05:33.634">YOU&apos;RE LIVING WITH THIS-- THIS-- YOU KNOW, A PERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.634" end="00:05:34.067">&gt;&gt; Jon:  YES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.067" end="00:05:36.069">&gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THESE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.069" end="00:05:39.406">SO WHAT HAPPENS THE KID READS THE BOOK, SHE LIKES THE BOOK,</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.406" end="00:05:45.779">HELEN LIKING THE BOOK AND FINALLY THEY ALL LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, &quot;WHY DON&apos;T YOU MACH A </p>

<p begin="00:05:49.116" end="00:05:51.251">WHAT&apos;S THE MATTER WITH YOU.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:51.251" end="00:05:54.087">&gt;&gt; I HAD ASTHMA ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS A KID.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.087" end="00:05:55.355">I WAS ISOLATED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.355" end="00:05:57.090">I COULDN&apos;T SPLAY SPORTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.090" end="00:05:59.760">I WAS KEPT IN A ROOM-- YOU KNOW.</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.732" end="00:06:06.633">THEY WOULDN&apos;T LET ME OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.633" end="00:06:08.468">&gt;&gt; Jon:  THEY KEPT YOU IN A ROOM SOMEWHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.468" end="00:06:09.269">&gt;&gt; IN THE APARTMENT, YES.</p>

<p begin="00:06:12.306" end="00:06:14.608">BUT I WASN&apos;T ALLOWED TO RUN OR LAUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.608" end="00:06:17.444">&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHAT!</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.444" end="00:06:21.315">&gt;&gt; THE POINT IS I&apos;D START LAUGHING AND, YOU KNOW -- </p>
<p begin="00:06:21.315" end="00:06:22.916">&gt;&gt; BUT YOU HAVE SUCH A GREAT LAUGH.</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.358" end="00:06:38.465">&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHY ISN&apos;T THIS A MOVIE BECAUSE THIS-- ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT AN INCREDIBLE FILM THAT </p>
<p begin="00:06:38.465" end="00:06:44.204">WOULD BE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.204" end="00:06:45.439">I THINK IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.</p>
