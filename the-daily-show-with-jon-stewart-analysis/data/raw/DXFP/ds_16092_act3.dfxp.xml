<p begin="00:00:05.606" end="00:00:07.307">SIR, NOW, OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW,</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.307" end="00:00:10.777">WE NEED EACH OTHER, CLEARLY WE NEED EACH OTHER IN THIS REGION,</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.777" end="00:00:12.679">ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE A PLAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.679" end="00:00:14.615">AND I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS...</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.615" end="00:00:19.686">OBVIOUSLY I&apos;M NOT A GENERAL, I&apos;M NOT INVOLVED IN HIGH-LEVEL INTELLIGENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.686" end="00:00:25.292">(LAUGHTER) BUT WE MAY BE LEAVING AFGHANISTAN WITHIN THE NEXT 50 OR 60 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.292" end="00:00:33.567">(LAUGHTER) AND IF THAT OCCURS, WHAT IS PAKISTAN&apos;S INTEREST IN THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:33.567" end="00:00:39.606">TALIBAN IN THAT, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE SITUATION THAT, AS YOU SEE IT WITH OUR MAYBE PULLING </p>
<p begin="00:00:39.606" end="00:00:40.707">BACK A LITTLE BIT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.707" end="00:00:44.545">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A SERIOUS ISSUE TO BE CONSIDERED, ESPECIALLY TO... IT </p>
<p begin="00:00:44.545" end="00:00:46.947">WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS ON PAKISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.947" end="00:00:53.153">IF YOU QUIT IN 2014, WHATEVER HAS BEEN DECLARED, OBVIOUSLY THE BEST STRATEGY FOR THE TALIBAN OR </p>
<p begin="00:00:53.153" end="00:00:54.688">THE ENEMY, AL QAEDA AND TALIBAN,</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.688" end="00:00:57.624">IS TO LIE LOW, LET TIME PASS,</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.624" end="00:00:58.792">AND THEN RISE AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.792" end="00:01:07.234">SO DECLARING... GIVING A TIMELINE, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE </p>
<p begin="00:01:07.234" end="00:01:09.503">EFFECTED, WHAT EFFECTS DO WE WANT TO CREATE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.503" end="00:01:12.506">YOU CAN&apos;T HAVE IT TIME RELATED BECAUSE THEN YOU&apos;LL BE IN THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:12.506" end="00:01:15.676">HANDS OF THE ENEMY, I WOULD SAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.676" end="00:01:20.180">AND IF YOU LEAVE IN 2014 WITHOUT STABILIZING AFGHANISTAN, WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN?</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.180" end="00:01:21.849">WE NEED TO VISUALIZE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.849" end="00:01:25.986">&gt;&gt; WELL, THE PROBLEM IS... THE DIFFICULTY I THINK FOR AMERICA IS AFGHANISTAN HASN&apos;T BEEN </p>
<p begin="00:01:25.986" end="00:01:30.757">STABLE SINCE, I GUESS, HANNIBAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.757" end="00:01:34.361">(LAUGHTER) SO THE IDEA THAT WE COULD STAY THERE...</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.361" end="00:01:34.761">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.761" end="00:01:39.533">THEY DON&apos;T APPEAR TO WANT TO BE STABILIZED SO I MEAN... I GUESS </p>
<p begin="00:01:39.533" end="00:01:42.336">THE PROBLEM IS CAN WE REALLY DO THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.336" end="00:01:52.346">CAN WE DO THAT FOR A COUNTRY AND IS PAKISTAN GOING TO GIVE THEM THE ROOM THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:52.346" end="00:01:56.216">DO THAT OR WOULD THEY PERHAPS TRY AND HAVE SOME INFLUENCE WITH THE TALIBAN ADDS WELL?</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.216" end="00:02:03.390">&gt;&gt; WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK AFGHANISTAN WAS STABLE SINCE CENTURIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:08.362">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, OBVIOUSLY I WAS BEING HUMERUS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.362" end="00:02:11.431">(LAUGHTER) ... HUMOROUS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.431" end="00:02:13.066">&gt;&gt; THEY HAD AN AGREEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.066" end="00:02:16.103">THE ETHNIC GROUPS DECIDED TO STAY TOGETHER UNDER THE MONARCHY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.103" end="00:02:22.576">THE PROBLEMS STARTED 1979 WHEN THE MONARCH WAS... WHEN THE KING WAS DEPOSED AND THAT&apos;S WHERE </p>
<p begin="00:02:22.576" end="00:02:31.985">THIS... WHERE THE WAR THAT THEY HAD, THAT GLUE THAT HELD THEM TOGETHER WAS NO MORE THAN THERE </p>
<p begin="00:02:31.985" end="00:02:34.087">AND THE TROUBLE STARTED WHEN THE SOVIETS CAME IN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.087" end="00:02:36.657">SO THAT&apos;S WHAT WE&apos;RE TRYING TO REPAIR NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.657" end="00:02:43.163">AND, INDEED, THEY ARE NOT A COUNTRY WHICH CAN HAVE DEMOCRACY AS ENOUGH THE UNITED STATES BUT </p>
<p begin="00:02:43.163" end="00:02:50.437">THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEIR OWN FORM OF DEMOCRACY TAILORED TO THEIR OWN REQUIREMENTS, GOVERNANCE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.437" end="00:02:53.207">TAIL ORRED TO AN AFGHANISTAN ENVIRONMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.207" end="00:02:54.208">THAT&apos;S WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.208" end="00:02:57.578">&gt;&gt; WELL, LET&apos;S... WE&apos;RE GOING TO GO... CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR </p>
<p begin="00:02:57.578" end="00:03:01.515">ABOUT FIVE, TEN MINUTES AND WE CAN TALK ON THE INTERWEBS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.515" end="00:03:02.482">PERVEZ MUSHARRAF.</p>
