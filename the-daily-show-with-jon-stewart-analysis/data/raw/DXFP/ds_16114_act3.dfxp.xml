<p begin="00:00:26.360" end="00:00:27.227">&gt;&gt; GOOD.</p>

<p begin="00:00:42.609" end="00:00:48.982">KIND OF PRESSURE, WHAT DO YOU DO FOR YOURSELF TO... DO YOU GO TO A SANDALS RESORT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.982" end="00:00:50.584">WHAT DOES AN ADMIRAL DO?</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.584" end="00:00:54.821">&gt;&gt; MY PLAN IS TO TAKE A LONG WINTER&apos;S NAP.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.821" end="00:00:56.557">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.557" end="00:01:01.895">&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY WE&apos;RE GOING TO TRY TO COME DOWN AND REST.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.895" end="00:01:06.967">WE&apos;VE BEEN GOING AT A PRETTY QUICK PACE HERE FOR UPWARDS OF SIX STRAIGHT YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.967" end="00:01:08.135">IT&apos;S TIME TO TAKE A BREAK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.135" end="00:01:08.769">WE&apos;RE GOING TO DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.769" end="00:01:13.307">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT I DIDN&apos;T KNOW ABOUT YOU AND WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT DURING </p>
<p begin="00:01:13.307" end="00:01:17.077">A RECENT SPRING BREAK TRIP TOGETHER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.077" end="00:01:20.314">YOU COME FROM SHOW BUSINESS FOLK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.314" end="00:01:22.549">YOUR FATHER WAS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.549" end="00:01:23.217">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.217" end="00:01:25.452">HE WAS A PUBLICIST OUT IN HOLLYWOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.452" end="00:01:27.354">THAT&apos;S THE BUSINESS I GREW UP IN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.354" end="00:01:32.226">ALTHOUGH AS I POINT OUT, I LEFT WHEN I WAS 17 WHICH WAS 1964.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.226" end="00:01:34.795">IT&apos;S BEEN A LONG TIME AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.795" end="00:01:38.365">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU WERE A 17-YEAR-OLD KID LIVING IN LOS ANGELES MEETING ALL THESE FAMOUS </p>
<p begin="00:01:38.365" end="00:01:42.836">PEOPLE AND YOU REBEL AGAINST YOUR PARENTS....</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.836" end="00:01:44.671">&gt;&gt; (LAUGHING).</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.671" end="00:01:47.341">&gt;&gt; Jon:... AND SAY, &quot;I&apos;VE HAD IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.341" end="00:01:50.878">I&apos;M JOINING THE NAVY.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:01:50.878" end="00:01:56.316">&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY THE REALLY NICE THING ABOUT MY PARENTS IS THAT THEY WERE NOT JUDGMENTAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.316" end="00:01:58.986">THEY STRONGLY SUPPORTED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.986" end="00:02:02.723">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR SON NOT,</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.723" end="00:02:09.263">LET&apos;S SAY, MOVING INTO THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS AND BECOMING A WASTE CASE WITH JIM MORRISON?</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.263" end="00:02:11.265">&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.265" end="00:02:15.869">ONE OF THE STRENGTHS IN THE FAMILY WAS MY DAD, WHO WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL PUBLICIST,</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.869" end="00:02:17.371">NEVER REALLY BROUGHT IT HOME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.371" end="00:02:18.405">WE HAD FUN WITH IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.405" end="00:02:20.774">GOT TO MEET THE PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.774" end="00:02:25.212">AS A KID SOME OF THOSE TV SHOWS, IT WAS PRETTY NEAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.212" end="00:02:30.717">BUT I THINK SOMEONE WOULD LOOK BACK ON IT AND SAY I GOT ABOUT AS FAR AWAY FROM IT AS I </p>
<p begin="00:02:30.717" end="00:02:31.285">POSSIBLY COULD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.285" end="00:02:31.885">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.885" end="00:02:33.287">I WOULD IMAGINE THAT&apos;S THE CASE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.287" end="00:02:36.957">YET THINGS WORKED OUT VERY NICELY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.957" end="00:02:44.331">NOW, WHEN YOU STARTED TO RISE UP THROUGH THIS, WHEN YOU ENTERED INTO THAT POLITICAL </p>
<p begin="00:02:44.331" end="00:02:48.702">SPHERE, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY YOU&apos;RE WORKING WITH JUST THE NAVY AND YOUR COMMANDING SHIPS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.702" end="00:02:52.539">WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST SURPRISE WHEN YOU JOINED THE MORE...</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.539" end="00:02:55.309">GOT INVOLVED WITH MORE OF THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP?</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.309" end="00:02:57.377">WAS THAT A STRUGGLE TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION?</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.377" end="00:03:02.482">&gt;&gt; I HAD BEEN IN AND OUT OF WASHINGTON IN JOBS IN THE NAVY SINCE THE MID &apos;90s.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.482" end="00:03:07.221">I HAD ALWAYS SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON CAPITOL HILL BECAUSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE MY BANKERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.221" end="00:03:11.525">SO IF WE WANT TO GET EQUIPMENT FOR THE TROOPS OR SHIPS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.525" end="00:03:14.795">AIRPLANES, ET CETERA, I PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.795" end="00:03:20.701">BUT WHAT I DIDN&apos;T REALLY UNDERSTAND COME ING INTO THIS JOB WAS THAT THE POLITICAL...</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.701" end="00:03:26.573">THAT THE POLITICAL LEVEL I WAS AT, EVERY TIME YOU WALK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, THAT </p>
<p begin="00:03:26.573" end="00:03:29.243">DOMINATES ALL THE ISSUES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.243" end="00:03:36.149">FOR A MILITARY GUY, THAT&apos;S NOT A FAMILIAR ENVIRONMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.149" end="00:03:42.689">TO ADJUST TO THAT, I WORK HARD TO GIVE MY BEST MILITARY ADVICE AND TO STAY, WHICH IS </p>
<p begin="00:03:42.689" end="00:03:47.094">CRITICAL FOR OUR MILITARY AND IN OUR COUNTRY, TO STAY APOLITICAL GIVING THAT ADVICE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.094" end="00:03:49.596">WHEN THE PRESIDENT MAKES DECISIONS, WE CARRY IT OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.596" end="00:03:53.200">THAT WAS A BIT OF A SHOCK CERTAINLY IN THE FIRST YEAR THAT I WAS IN THIS JOB.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:55.169">&gt;&gt; Jim: I....</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.169" end="00:03:59.573">&gt;&gt; Jon: I WAS SURPRISED IN MEETING THE PEOPLE THAT I&apos;VE MET IN THE MILITARY HOW </p>
<p begin="00:03:59.573" end="00:04:00.908">APOLITICAL THEY TRULY ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.908" end="00:04:04.444">HOW IT REALLY IS SO MUCH MORE MISSION BASED AND FRATERNAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.444" end="00:04:09.349">IT&apos;S ABOUT THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND EXECUTING THE TASK THAT THEY&apos;VE BEEN GIVEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.349" end="00:04:14.488">&gt;&gt; AS YOU SAW ON THE TRIP THAT WE WERE ON TOGETHER, THEY CARE </p>
<p begin="00:04:14.488" end="00:04:16.456">SO MUCH ABOUT WHO THEY&apos;RE WITH,</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.456" end="00:04:18.091">WHO THEY&apos;RE FIGHTING WITH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.091" end="00:04:19.726">IN MANY WAYS THAT&apos;S WHY THEY&apos;RE THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.726" end="00:04:22.563">THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY&apos;RE DOING FOR THEIR COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.563" end="00:04:23.664">THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR MISSION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.664" end="00:04:26.433">THIS IS THE BEST MILITARY I&apos;VE EVER SEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.433" end="00:04:30.504">I MEAN I&apos;VE BEEN DOING THIS 196.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.504" end="00:04:32.339">OVER 4...1968.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.339" end="00:04:34.274">OVER 43 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.274" end="00:04:35.676">UNQUESTIONABLY THEY ARE SUPERB.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.676" end="00:04:39.746">&gt;&gt; Jim: I WAS SURPRISED AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE FIGHTING MEN AND WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.746" end="00:04:46.086">I WAS SURPRISED WHEN WE LANDED IN KANDAHAR THAT YOU FORCED THEM TO CARRY YOU AROUND ON A LITTER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.086" end="00:04:58.732">(LAUGHING) I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING AND I DON&apos;T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT ROSE PET ALS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.732" end="00:05:03.770">(LAUGHING) IT&apos;S A DRY AND ARID PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.770" end="00:05:05.305">BUT I&apos;M GLAD YOU WERE COMFORTABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.305" end="00:05:08.909">&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY THAT USUALLY ONLY HAPPENS ONCE A TRIP.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.909" end="00:05:12.312">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHING) (  <span tts:fontStyle="italic">CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</span> </p>
<p begin="00:05:12.312" end="00:05:13.480">I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.480" end="00:05:15.215">WHAT SO IMPRESSED ME, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.215" end="00:05:17.084">WE GOT TO INTERACT A LOT WITH THE GUYS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.084" end="00:05:18.418">IT WAS REALLY WONDERFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.418" end="00:05:22.856">BUT THE INTERACTION THAT THEY HAD WITH YOU, THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE DEPTH TO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.856" end="00:05:26.260">THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GATHERED THEM AROUND THAT FIRST NIGHT AND YOU WERE SORT </p>
<p begin="00:05:26.260" end="00:05:30.898">OF GOING AROUND AND YOU WERE SAYING WHO IS ON THE FIRST TOUR AND SECOND TOUR AND YOU </p>
<p begin="00:05:30.898" end="00:05:32.566">STARTED TO SEE HANDS GO UP.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.566" end="00:05:36.170">SOME GUYS, 5th TOUR, 6th TOUR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.170" end="00:05:38.906">YOU KNOW HOW MUCH DIFFICULTY IT WAS ON THEIR FAMILIES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.906" end="00:05:44.144">THE MOMENTS THAT YOU SPENT WITH THEM, THEY REALLY SEEMED TO APPRECIATE IN A VERY DEEP WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.144" end="00:05:51.185">&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I-- AND I&apos;M HERE TONIGHT WITH DEBRA WHO IS IN THE AUDIENCE </p>
<p begin="00:05:51.185" end="00:05:55.822">TONIGHT AND MY WIFE OF OVER 40 YEARS, 41 YEARS, WE&apos;VE TRIED TO REPRESENT THEIR NEEDS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.822" end="00:06:02.062">WE&apos;VE TRIED TO BE IN TOUCH ENOUGH WITH THEM SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY&apos;RE DOING,</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.062" end="00:06:05.933">WHAT WE&apos;RE ASKING THEM TO DO INCLUDING PAYING THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.933" end="00:06:07.034">AND I TELL THEM THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.034" end="00:06:08.168">THIS REALLY IS TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.168" end="00:06:10.604">THERE ISN&apos;T A DECISION THAT I MAKE OR A RECOMMENDATION THAT </p>
<p begin="00:06:10.604" end="00:06:15.475">I MAKE THAT DOESN&apos;T TAKE THEIR NEEDS AS BEST I CAN UNDERSTAND IT INTO ACCOUNT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.475" end="00:06:24.051">AND SO THE STRENGTH OF OUR MILITARY ARE THOSE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.051" end="00:06:26.420">WE&apos;VE REALLY TRIED TO ENGAGE THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.420" end="00:06:28.889">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT SURPRISED ME THOUGH THE FLEXIBILITY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.889" end="00:06:33.660">I HAD A STEREOTYPICAL VIEW OF THE MILITARY AS BEING A MUCH MORE RIGID ORGANIZATION.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.660" end="00:06:37.898">YOU&apos;RE SURROUNDED BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO CHALLENGE YOU AND TO CHALLENGE </p>
<p begin="00:06:37.898" end="00:06:38.899">YOUR THINKING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.899" end="00:06:43.937">THAT BRINGS AN ETHOS INTO WHAT YOU DO, INTO YOUR DECISION-MAKING PROCESS THAT </p>
<p begin="00:06:43.937" end="00:06:45.472">SEEMS MORE FLEXIBLE THAN WHAT WE HAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.472" end="00:06:49.643">&gt;&gt; WHAT I&apos;VE FOUND OVER THE YEARS AS I&apos;VE GOTTEN MORE SENIOR AND INTO THESE JOBS OF </p>
<p begin="00:06:49.643" end="00:06:55.716">GREATER RESPONSIBILITY IS THE DIVERSITY OF OPINION AND VIEWS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.716" end="00:06:58.218">IT ALLOWS ME IN THE END TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION.</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.218" end="00:07:01.021">IT DOESN&apos;T MAKE MY STAFF COMFORTABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.021" end="00:07:03.357">EVERY DAY, FOR SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.357" end="00:07:06.827">ACTUALLY IT DOESN&apos;T MAKE OTHER SENIOR OFFICERS VERY COMFORTABLE BECAUSE EVERYBODY </p>
<p begin="00:07:06.827" end="00:07:12.833">DOESN&apos;T DO IT BUT I TRY TO DO THAT TO ARRIVE AT THE BEST DECISION AND RECOMMENDATIONS </p>
