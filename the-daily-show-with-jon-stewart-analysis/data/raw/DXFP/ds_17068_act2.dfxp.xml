<p begin="00:00:27.895" end="00:00:31.031">PRESIDENT AFTER PRESIDENT HAS TRIED AND FAILED TO PROPOSE A LASTING SOLUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.031" end="00:00:34.635">BUT RECENTLY THE PALESTINIANS ATTEMPTED A NEW TACTIC.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.635" end="00:00:38.372">&gt;&gt; PALESTINE WANTS FULL MEMBERSHIP FOR THE U.N..</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.372" end="00:00:39.840">&gt;&gt; PALESTINIANS WANT THE U.N.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:42.876">TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS THE STATE OF PALESTINE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.876" end="00:00:46.880">&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE PROBLEM IS THAT RECOGNITION WOULD FORCE PALESTINE&apos;S NEIGHBORS TO </p>
<p begin="00:00:46.880" end="00:00:50.517">ACKNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE PALESTINE FOR A NEIGHBOR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.517" end="00:00:54.922">THE PALESTINIAN AMBASSADOR SAT DOWN WITH ME TO DISCUSS THIS TRICKY SITUATION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.922" end="00:00:58.091">WE BEGAN A FREE AND OPEN DIALOGUE IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY.</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.925" end="00:01:34.695">TO A PROVISIONAL AGREEMENT ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THIS ROOM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.695" end="00:01:37.097">&gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO LOWER THE TEMPERATURE IT&apos;S FINE WITH ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.097" end="00:01:40.000">&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT WHO IS GOING TO CONTROL THE THERMOSTAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:43.437">&gt;&gt; THE THERMOSTAT DIRECTLY SHOULD BE SHARED BY ALL OF US.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.437" end="00:01:47.941">&gt;&gt; Reporter: DON&apos;T EVEN THINK ABOUT DEVOIDING THE THERMOSTAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.941" end="00:01:52.980">&gt;&gt; WE WILL NOT DIVIDE THE THERMOSTAT BUT IT SHOULD BE ACCESSED BY ALL THOSE WHO </p>
<p begin="00:01:52.980" end="00:01:56.316">CHERISH IT AND THINK THAT IT IS THE ONLY PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.316" end="00:02:00.287">&gt;&gt; Reporter: AFTER THREE-AND-A-HALF HOURS OF LABOR USE NEGOTIATIONS WE </p>
<p begin="00:02:00.287" end="00:02:02.489">FINALLY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.489" end="00:02:07.561">WE AGREE THAT AT AN UNSPECIFIED TIME IN THE FUTURE WE WILL ANNOUNCE A SUMMIT TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:07.561" end="00:02:12.299">DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCUSSING A NEGOTIATION TOWARDS AN AGREEMENT ON TEMPERATURE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.299" end="00:02:12.900">YES?</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:13.367">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.679" end="00:02:31.084">UNFORTUNATELY THE PALESTINIAN- U.N. APPLICATION HAS WON LITTLE STAR SPANGLED OBSTACLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.084" end="00:02:35.556">&gt;&gt; THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS PLEDGED TO VETO ANY MOVE TOWARDS STATEHOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.556" end="00:02:36.557">&gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.338" end="00:02:54.641">&gt;&gt; ALL OF THE COUNTRIES ARE IMPORTANT.</p>

<p begin="00:03:12.793" end="00:03:15.229">RECOGNITION OF THE STATE OF PALESTINE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.229" end="00:03:16.964">THEY&apos;RE JUST SAYING IT&apos;S ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME.</p>
