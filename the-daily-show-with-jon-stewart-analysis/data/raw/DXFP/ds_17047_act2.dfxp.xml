<p begin="00:03:35.249" end="00:03:41.088">&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO TO KEEP THE BAFONGOOS IN WASHINGTON TO OVERREGULATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.088" end="00:03:41.622">VOTE AGAINST THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.622" end="00:03:44.791">&gt;&gt; SO PONY UP SOME CASH AND BUY SOME VOTES, IS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.</p>

<p begin="00:03:57.104" end="00:04:00.274">&gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE SPEAKING ABOUT CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES THEN I THINK THERE IS A DEFINITE </p>
<p begin="00:04:00.274" end="00:04:07.581">NEED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO USE LAW ENFORCEMENT METHODS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON&apos;T PROSPER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.581" end="00:04:10.050">&gt;&gt; I THINK WE SHOULD GO FISHING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.050" end="00:04:15.789">&gt;&gt; EVEN THE FREE MARKETEERS WERE SELLING OUT AND AS WE ALL KNOW THERE IS ON ONE WAY </p>

<p begin="00:04:25.699" end="00:04:29.236">&gt;&gt; BUT MAYBE THE WORST THING ABOUT THESE REGULATIONS IS THE HARM THEY&apos;RE DOING TO </p>
<p begin="00:04:29.236" end="00:04:32.840">THE STORIED STRUCTURE OF THIS PROUD AMERICAN INDUSTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.840" end="00:04:38.212">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THESE RICO LAWS, SOME GUYS ARE ACTUALLY REFUSING TO BE MADE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.212" end="00:04:39.980">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE TURNING DOWN OFFERS TO GET MADE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.980" end="00:04:41.348">&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.348" end="00:04:46.453">GUYS REFUSING THE BIGGEST HONOR IN THE MAFIA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.453" end="00:04:53.961">IT&apos;S [BLEEP], YEAH, YOU DON&apos;T HAVE A JOKE, THAT&apos;S BECAUSE IT&apos;S NOT FUNNY.</p>

<p begin="00:05:28.595" end="00:05:32.966">&gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE IT&apos;S AN OFFER THEY CAN REFUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.966" end="00:05:35.402">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S NOT FUNNY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.402" end="00:05:36.770">&gt;&gt; IT WAS A LITTLE FUNNY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.770" end="00:05:39.306">&gt;&gt; NO, NOT AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.306" end="00:05:40.174">&gt;&gt; LITTLE BIT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.174" end="00:05:46.480">&gt;&gt; AS THE MAFIA STRUGGLES TO OVERCOME THIS STIFLING REGULATION, ONE THING REMAINS CLEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.480" end="00:05:48.749">&gt;&gt; YOU REALLY ARE A [BLEEP]</p>
