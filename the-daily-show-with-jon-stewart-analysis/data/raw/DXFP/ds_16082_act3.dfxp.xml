<p begin="00:00:06.607" end="00:00:10.143">WITHIN WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST THE MEDIA DIX EDITOR FOR &quot;THE NEW YORK TIMES&quot; AND </p>
<p begin="00:00:10.143" end="00:00:13.547">FEATURED IN THE DOCUMENTARY FILM ABOUT THE TIMES CALLED &quot;PAGE 1&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:00:13.547" end="00:00:17.284">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M GOING TO IRAQ.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.284" end="00:00:21.722">&gt;&gt; HE&apos;S DONE ALL THESE STORIES ON MEDIA COMPANIES AND CAPITOL CASES, DEATH ROW </p>
<p begin="00:00:21.722" end="00:00:25.292">AND TIM IS JUST ONE OF THE GUYS WHO WANTS ANSWERS TO REALLY BASIC QUESTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.292" end="00:00:27.160">I THINK ONCE YOU&apos;VE GOT THAT,</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.160" end="00:00:29.596">YOU&apos;RE CURIOUS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.596" end="00:00:35.068">IRAQ IS KIND OF OFF PEOPLE&apos;S RADAR SCREENS HERE BUT WE STILL HAVE 120,000 SOLDIERS THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.068" end="00:00:40.841">AND IT&apos;S A REAL CRUCIAL POINT IN TERMS OF SEEING WHAT THE LAST CHAPTER IS FOR </p>
<p begin="00:00:40.841" end="00:00:42.809">OUR COUNTRY THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.809" end="00:00:46.980">&gt;&gt; PLEASE WELCOME BRUISE HEADLAM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:49.683">-- BRUCE HEADLAMB.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.683" end="00:00:50.050">THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.050" end="00:00:50.784">NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.784" end="00:00:54.087">(APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.087" end="00:00:55.455">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.455" end="00:00:58.859">&gt;&gt; Jon: I WANT TO SAY WE HAD SCHEDULED TO INTERVIEW THE DIRECTOR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:00:59.226">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.226" end="00:01:02.262">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO PUT THE FILM TOGETHER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.262" end="00:01:05.465">BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS A LITTLE UNDER THE WEATHER AND COULDN&apos;T MAKE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.465" end="00:01:08.368">SO HE MADE YOU DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.368" end="00:01:08.702">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.702" end="00:01:12.306">AND WHEN YOU MENTIONED THE TIMES REVIEW I THINK HE FLAT LINED AT THE HOSPITAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.306" end="00:01:13.874">HE MAY BE GONE NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.874" end="00:01:16.977">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET ME JUST ASK YOU OBVIOUSLY THE QUESTIONS I WAS GOING TO ASK HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.977" end="00:01:21.815">WHEN YOU WERE PUTTING THIS MOVIE TOGETHER, WERE THEY NERVOUS AT THE TIMES TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:21.815" end="00:01:27.187">ALLOW A FILMMAKER TO COME IN AND DOCUMENT THEIR PROCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.187" end="00:01:30.457">WAS THERE ANY SORT OF INTERNAL DISCUSSION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.457" end="00:01:35.095">&gt;&gt; THERE WAS BECAUSE THE CREW THAT HAD BEEN FROM THE DAILY SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.095" end="00:01:37.097">&gt;&gt; AND THAT HAD NOT GONE NEARLY SO WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.097" end="00:01:38.732">THEY WERE SURPRISINGLY NOT NERVOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.732" end="00:01:39.466">I WAS NERVOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.466" end="00:01:44.204">I DIDN&apos;T WANT TO DO IT BUT IT WAS PRESENTED TO BE BY BILL KELLER MY BOSS, I SAID </p>
<p begin="00:01:44.204" end="00:01:47.207">ENOUGH OF MY REPORTERS WANTED TO DO IT I WOULD GO ALONG WITH IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.207" end="00:01:48.575">BUT I WASN&apos;T IN FAVOR OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.575" end="00:01:50.277">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT SORT OF A DEMOCRACY AT THE TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.277" end="00:01:52.312">&gt;&gt; YES, THAT&apos;S EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.312" end="00:01:53.347">&gt;&gt; Jon: VERY EXCITING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.347" end="00:01:53.680">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.680" end="00:01:55.649">&gt;&gt; Jon: LIKE A VELVET REVOLUTION OVER THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:01:56.416">THAT&apos;S EXCITING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.416" end="00:02:01.488">&gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU SAW THE PAGE 1 SCENE, TO SEE HOW DEMOCRATIC THEY ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.488" end="00:02:02.089">&gt;&gt; Jon: EXACTLY RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.089" end="00:02:04.925">YOU LIVE LIKE ANTS IN YOUR CUBICLES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.925" end="00:02:12.633">DOES THE TIMES, IS THE FEAR THERE THAT YOU KNOW, THE DOCUMENTARY IS SORT OF </p>
<p begin="00:02:12.633" end="00:02:18.639">CAPTURING THIS OBSOLETE TIME IN AMERICA, IT&apos;S LIKE WE&apos;LL LOOK BACK YEARS FROM NOW AND </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.639" end="00:02:23.377">BE LIKE THE OLD HORSES USED TO PULL ALL THE WAGONS AND THEN THE AUTOMOBILE CAME BY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.377" end="00:02:25.812">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK THE TIMES LOOKS AT ITSELF THAT WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.812" end="00:02:28.182">I DON&apos;T THINK THE FILM GETS THAT PARTICULARLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.182" end="00:02:32.553">YOU KNOW, I WAS SKEPTICAL BECAUSE I THOUGHT WELL, WE COVER THE MEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.553" end="00:02:34.721">WE&apos;RE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.721" end="00:02:36.390">NOBODY IS SHOOTING AT US.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.390" end="00:02:37.457">WE COVER FOX NEWS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.457" end="00:02:42.196">WHICH IS-- BY THE WAY, THEY LOVE YOU GUYS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.196" end="00:02:43.230">I WAS OVER THERE ON SUNDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.230" end="00:02:48.669">&gt;&gt; WE DON&apos;T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DRIVE THROUGH CHECK POINTS TO GET TO FOX NEWS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.669" end="00:02:52.406">&gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK THE TIMES FELT THERE WAS A STORY TO TELL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.406" end="00:02:55.542">NOW THE MINUTE ANDREW STARTED FILMING WIKI LEAKS HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.542" end="00:02:56.910">WE HAD LAYOFFS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.910" end="00:02:58.612">OUR STOCK PLUMMETED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.612" end="00:03:01.048">MANY PEOPLE WERE PREDICTING OUR DEMISE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.048" end="00:03:03.050">MANY PEOPLE WERE CHEERING OUR DEMISE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.050" end="00:03:07.054">SO PROBABLY SIX MONTHS LATER I&apos;M NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE WELCOMED ANDREW QUITE THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.054" end="00:03:08.188">WAY WE DID AT THAT POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.188" end="00:03:12.726">BUT HE MANAGED TO CAPTURE A LOT OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING THAT YEAR AND A LOT OF THE DRAMA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.726" end="00:03:16.663">&gt;&gt; THE WIKI LEAKS STUFF IS THE MOST FASCINATING BECAUSE IT REPRESENTED THAT, YOU </p>
<p begin="00:03:16.663" end="00:03:20.734">KNOW, THEY HAVE BRIAN IN THERE WHO IS YOUNGER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.734" end="00:03:27.074">AND SO HE I THINK MAYBE HAS A LITTLE MORE INSIGHT INTO THE SCENES WHERE HE IS SORT </p>
<p begin="00:03:27.074" end="00:03:32.079">OF INTERACTING WITH SOME OF THE OLDER, YOU KNOW, NO DISRESPECT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.079" end="00:03:33.080">&gt;&gt; NO DISRESPECT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.080" end="00:03:35.148">&gt;&gt; BUT IT JUST WAS KIND OF -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:35.148" end="00:03:36.517">&gt;&gt; SLOWER, WEAKER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.517" end="00:03:38.085">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT WAS LIKE WAIT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.085" end="00:03:40.420">YOU DON&apos;T REIT TWITTER THAT IS KIND OF WHERE IT IS HAPPENING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.420" end="00:03:44.525">LIKE HE HAS THERE IS A SENSE THAT HE WAS URGING EVERYBODY TO EMBRACE SOMETHING THAT </p>
<p begin="00:03:44.525" end="00:03:46.393">THERE WAS SOME RESISTENCE TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.393" end="00:03:49.363">&gt;&gt; AND BRIAN URGES ALL OF US TO EMBRACE TWITTER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.363" end="00:03:53.867">I ENCOURAGE BRIAN TO SEND #ï¿½Q!AT DOESN&apos;T SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN HOLD YET.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.867" end="00:03:58.705">NO, I THINK HE&apos;S A GOOD EXAMPLE, DAVID CARR WITHOUT AS MANY PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW IS </p>
<p begin="00:03:58.705" end="00:04:00.040">ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.040" end="00:04:01.475">IT&apos;S REALLY A PLACE IN TRANSITION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.475" end="00:04:06.680">AND I DON&apos;T WANT THE FILM TO BE SEEN AS A KIND OF OLD,</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.680" end="00:04:10.417">GRUMPY, NEWSPAPER HERE AND HERE ARE THE COOL KIDS OVER HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.417" end="00:04:11.618">IT&apos;S MUCH MORE FLUID.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.618" end="00:04:16.490">THE TIMES WEB SITE IS A MASSIVE WEB SITE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.490" end="00:04:19.193">ON TWIRT, ON FACEBOOK, THEY DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.193" end="00:04:21.261">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT STILL FEELS LIKE CONTENT IS ALWAYS KING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.261" end="00:04:22.663">IF YOU ESTABLISH, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.663" end="00:04:28.202">MAYBE THE TIMES EDITORIAL AUTHORITY IS NOT WHAT IT WAS BUT IF YOU ESTABLISH THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:28.202" end="00:04:30.437">IDEA OF TRUSTED CONTENT,</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.437" end="00:04:32.906">WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHERE IT IS DISTRIBUTED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.906" end="00:04:37.244">&gt;&gt; WELL, THE ONE DIFFERENCE IT MAKES IS THAT WE MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY IN A </p>
<p begin="00:04:37.244" end="00:04:38.679">NEWSPAPER THAN WE DO ON-LINE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.679" end="00:04:44.084">AND THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HUGE STRUGGLES WHICH IS THE FINANCIAL UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR BUSINESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.084" end="00:04:44.785">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY IS THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.785" end="00:04:48.188">BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE OTHER SITES THAT ARE ON-LINE THAT YOU CAN&apos;T EVEN </p>
<p begin="00:04:48.188" end="00:04:49.223">FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY DO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.223" end="00:04:53.293">AND THEY&apos;RE SELLING FOR $10 BILLION AT IPOs.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.293" end="00:04:57.731">IT&apos;S JUST LIKE AN ON-LINE SITE, EVERYBODY, LET&apos;S GET TOGETHER AND WE&apos;LL ALL GET A </p>
<p begin="00:04:57.731" end="00:04:59.132">DISCOUNT ON A MASSAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.132" end="00:05:03.837">AND THAT IPO GOES FOR, YOU KNOW, WHY ISN&apos;T ON-LINE ADVERTISING, BECAUSE THAT IS </p>
<p begin="00:05:03.837" end="00:05:05.205">WHERE THEY ARE ALL ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.205" end="00:05:07.941">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE ONE REASON IS YOU KNOW WE&apos;RE IN BAGHDAD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.941" end="00:05:09.676">AND THAT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.676" end="00:05:12.045">THE COST BEHIND THOSE SITES IS NOT THAT GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.045" end="00:05:12.546">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.546" end="00:05:16.517">&gt;&gt; IF THEY ARE OFFERING MASSAGES IN BAGHDAD IT WOULD BE A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.517" end="00:05:18.285">THEN WE WOULD BE ON EQUAL GROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.285" end="00:05:24.057">&gt;&gt; Jon: I THINK I MEANT LIKE WHY DOESN&apos;T ADVERTISING, WHY ISN&apos;T THE RATE MORE </p>
<p begin="00:05:24.057" end="00:05:25.959">COMMENSURATE WITH THE WAY THAT TECHNOLOGY IS -- </p>
<p begin="00:05:25.959" end="00:05:27.394">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.394" end="00:05:32.366">WITH &quot;THE NEW YORK TIMES&quot; THERE&apos;S SCARCITY, TIFFANIES HAS BEEN ON PAGE THREE FOR </p>
<p begin="00:05:32.366" end="00:05:33.166">GOD KNOWS, A SENT REE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.166" end="00:05:37.638">YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY WEB SITES, MANY LOW COST WAYS TO REACH TEAM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.638" end="00:05:38.071">-- PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.071" end="00:05:43.777">THE ON-LINE ADVERTISING IS NOT AS LUCRATIVE RIGHT NOW AS ADVERTISING IN THE PAPER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.777" end="00:05:46.880">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU THINK THE TIMES WILL BE ABLE TO BE AS AGILE, CONTINUE TO DO THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:47.881">TYPE OF REPORTING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.881" end="00:05:49.283">BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SITES,</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.283" end="00:05:51.418">STILL RELY ON TIMES REPORTING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.418" end="00:05:55.622">IT&apos;S NOT LIKE THE TIMES REPORTING IS NOT OUT THERE AND DISSEMINATED EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.622" end="00:05:57.558">A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST GO THAT&apos;S REALLY GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.558" end="00:05:59.927">&gt;&gt; THE TIMES IS THE GREAT STRAIGHT LINE OF AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.927" end="00:06:05.432">EVERYBODY ELSE GETS TO TELL THE JOKES OFF WHAT WE DO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.432" end="00:06:06.033">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.033" end="00:06:10.737">(LAUGHTER) WELL, WELL, WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.737" end="00:06:11.405">&gt;&gt; WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.405" end="00:06:12.105">IT&apos;S COME TO THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.105" end="00:06:13.473">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO WE MEET AT LAST.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.473" end="00:06:15.676">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:06:15.676" end="00:06:18.579">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, REALLY INTERESTING LOOK AT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.579" end="00:06:20.314">I&apos;M GLAD THAT YOU GUYS DID IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.314" end="00:06:22.049">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M GLAD WE DID TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.049" end="00:06:27.221">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND LET A REAL FILMMAKER DO IT RATHER THAN JUST COMEDIANS RIDICULING </p>
<p begin="00:06:27.221" end="00:06:27.788">YOU FOR FOUR MINUTES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.788" end="00:06:29.923">THANK YOU FOR COMING IN AND TAKING THE DIRECTOR&apos;S PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.923" end="00:06:30.624">REALLY APPRECIATE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.624" end="00:06:31.291">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.291" end="00:06:33.060">THANKS SO MUCH.</p>
