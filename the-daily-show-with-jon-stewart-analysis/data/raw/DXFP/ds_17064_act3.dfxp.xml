<p begin="00:01:10.237" end="00:01:12.739">&gt;&gt; Jon: TELL ME ABOUT THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.739" end="00:01:13.707">SPACE CHRONICLES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.707" end="00:01:20.781">THE BASIC PREMISE OF THIS IS WE NO LONGER PRIORITIZE SPACE EXPLORATION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.781" end="00:01:23.383">YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A TRAGIC MISSTEP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.383" end="00:01:23.784">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.784" end="00:01:25.452">&gt;&gt; Jon: FOR OUR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.452" end="00:01:26.353">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.353" end="00:01:27.087">TRAGIC MISSTEP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.087" end="00:01:28.922">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU FOR COMING BY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.922" end="00:01:29.857">EXCELLENT WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.857" end="00:01:32.259">THE BOOK IS CALLED SPACE CHRONICLES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.259" end="00:01:33.227">&gt;&gt; (LAUGHING).</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.227" end="00:01:35.462">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT IS IT THAT....</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.462" end="00:01:36.263">&gt;&gt; HERE&apos;S WHAT HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.263" end="00:01:39.399">IN THE 1960s WE WERE AT WAR WITH THE SOVIET UNION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.399" end="00:01:40.267">THE COLD WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.267" end="00:01:43.937">A LITTLE BIT OF HOT WAR OVER IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.937" end="00:01:50.577">SO WE FEARED THEM BECAUSE THEY PUT UP SPUTNIK WHICH BY THE WAY PEOPLE FORGET WAS AN </p>
<p begin="00:01:50.577" end="00:01:54.448">EMPTIED OUT CASING OF AN INTER-CONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.448" end="00:01:56.650">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DON&apos;T THINK PEOPLE FORGOT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.650" end="00:01:57.951">I DON&apos;T THINK ANYBODY KNEW THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.951" end="00:01:59.520">&gt;&gt; OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:04.658">SO, SO, SO THEY PUT A LITTLE DEVICE THAT GOES BEEP, BEEP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.658" end="00:02:07.861">AND SPUTNIK ITSELF MEANS FELLOW TRAVELER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.861" end="00:02:12.733">IT&apos;S ALL PEACEFUL BUT IT WAS A BALLISTIC MISSILE HEAD WITHOUT EXPLOSIVES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.733" end="00:02:14.201">THAT WAS A SIGNAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.201" end="00:02:16.403">WE FREAKED IN AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.403" end="00:02:18.071">NASA GOT FOUNDED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.071" end="00:02:20.908">ON THE FEAR FACTOR OF SPUTNIK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.908" end="00:02:21.608">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.608" end="00:02:26.980">SO WE THEN GO TO THE MOON ON THE FEAR FACTOR THAT RUSSIA WILL CONTROL HIGH GROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.980" end="00:02:33.287">THEN WE GO TO THE MOON, SPACE ENTHUSIASTS SAY, OH, WE&apos;RE ON THE MOON BY &apos;69.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.287" end="00:02:35.122">WE&apos;LL BE ON MARS IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.122" end="00:02:38.458">THEY COMPLETELY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY WE GOT TO THE MOON IN THE FIRST PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.458" end="00:02:39.593">WE WERE AT WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.593" end="00:02:43.397">ONCE WE SAW THAT RUSSIA WAS NOT READY TO LAND ON THE MOON,</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.397" end="00:02:45.966">WE STOPPED GOING TO THE MOON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.966" end="00:02:48.468">THAT SHOULD NOT SURPRISE ANYBODY LOOKING BACK ON IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.468" end="00:02:53.640">MEANWHILE, HOWEVER, THAT ENTIRE ERA GALVANIZED THE NATION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.640" end="00:02:55.175">FORGET THE WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.175" end="00:02:58.946">IT GALVANIZED US ALL TO DREAM ABOUT TOMORROW, TO THINK ABOUT THE HOMES OF TOMORROW, CITIES </p>
<p begin="00:02:58.946" end="00:03:00.948">OF TOMORROW, THE FOOD OF TOMORROW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.948" end="00:03:02.316">EVERYTHING WAS FUTURE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.316" end="00:03:04.184">FUTURE LAND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.184" end="00:03:12.359">THE WORLD&apos;S FAIR, ALL OF THIS WAS FOCUSED ON ENABLING PEOPLE TO MAKE TOMORROW COME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.359" end="00:03:18.265">THAT WAS A CULTURAL MIND SET THAT THE SPACE PROGRAM BROUGHT UPON US.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.265" end="00:03:24.805">WE REAPED THE BENEFITS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH BECAUSE YOU HAD PEOPLE WANTING TO BECOME </p>
<p begin="00:03:24.805" end="00:03:29.943">SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ENABLED TOMORROW TO EXIST TODAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.943" end="00:03:33.547">AND SO IT IS THAT MINE SET....</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.547" end="00:03:37.251">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE (BEEP) WALT DISNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.251" end="00:03:39.486">LISTEN TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.486" end="00:03:42.856">YOU ARE INSPIRING ME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.856" end="00:03:47.594">I&apos;M GOING TO GO HOME AND FIX MYSELF A GLASS OF TANG.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.594" end="00:03:48.262">I&apos;M EXCITED NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.262" end="00:03:52.099">&gt;&gt; SO TODAY, OKAY, I&apos;D RATHER WAR NOT BE THE DRIVER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.099" end="00:03:54.134">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, LET IT BE THE DRIVER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.134" end="00:03:56.136">&gt;&gt; IT COULD HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.136" end="00:04:01.375">CHINA WANTS TO PUT A MILITARY BASE ON THE MOON WE&apos;RE THERE IN TWO YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.375" end="00:04:06.713">&gt;&gt; Jon: I HEARD AL QAEDA IS GOING TO MARS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.713" end="00:04:09.049">&gt;&gt; THIS COULD WORK EASY IN THE MARKETING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.049" end="00:04:11.919">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU BROUGHT UP SOMETHING EARLIER THAT I THOUGHT WAS FASCINATING, THAT </p>
<p begin="00:04:11.919" end="00:04:13.820">THE PROGRESS WAS NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR US.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.820" end="00:04:18.792">WAS ITS THAT THE EXPECTATION BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IN FILMS AND POPULAR CULTURE IS </p>
<p begin="00:04:18.792" end="00:04:21.595">THAT WE WOULD LAND ON THE MOON AND THEN WE DISCOVER PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.595" end="00:04:28.569">THEN THEY WOULD WANT TO PHONE HOME AND BY NOT FINDING THESE THINGS, THE WORK THAT WE&apos;RE </p>
<p begin="00:04:28.569" end="00:04:34.708">DOING IS TOO ESOTERIC AND ABSTRACT FOR THE AMERICANS TO GET BEHIND.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.708" end="00:04:35.375">&gt;&gt; NO, NO,.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.375" end="00:04:36.710">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S NOT RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.710" end="00:04:37.377">THAT&apos;S WHAT I SAID.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.377" end="00:04:39.446">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S NOT ABOUT ESOTERIC.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.446" end="00:04:40.647">IT&apos;S ABOUT NO LONGER....</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.647" end="00:04:43.083">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE THINK IT&apos;S ESOTERIC.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.083" end="00:04:45.953">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S ABOUT WE NO LONGER ADVANCED A SPACE FRONTIER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.953" end="00:04:51.158">THE WHOLE SHUTTLE PROGRAM MADE THE SPACE STATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.158" end="00:04:54.862">SPACE SHUTTLE BOLDLY WENT WHERE HUNDREDS HAD GONE BEFORE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.862" end="00:04:58.398">THAT IS NOT WHAT NEWSPAPERS RIGHT ABOUT AS ADVANCING A FRONTIER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.398" end="00:04:59.766">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHAT I&apos;M SAYING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.766" end="00:05:03.136">&gt;&gt; I SUBMIT TO YOU IF WE DOUBLE NASA&apos;S BUDGET....</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.136" end="00:05:04.671">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT?</p>

<p begin="00:05:26.660" end="00:05:33.066">THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO GO TO MARS SOON WITH PEOPLE AND GO BACK TO THE MOON AND ON TO ASTROID.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.066" end="00:05:40.641">NOT ONLY DOES THAT STOKE THE AMBITIONS OF KIDS IN THE PIPELINE, IT SHIFTS THE MIND </p>
<p begin="00:05:40.641" end="00:05:44.811">SETS OF A NATION THAT ENABLE US ALL TO NOW SAY, HEY,</p>
