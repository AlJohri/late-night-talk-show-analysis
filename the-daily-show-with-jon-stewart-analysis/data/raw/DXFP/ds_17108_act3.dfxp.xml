<p begin="00:00:08.976" end="00:00:13.213">&gt;&gt; Jon: OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO, HE&apos;S NOW THE LIBERTARIAN </p>
<p begin="00:00:13.213" end="00:00:14.781">CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.781" end="00:00:19.186">WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM GOVERNOR GARY JOHNSON.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.186" end="00:00:25.893">(APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.893" end="00:00:26.827">&gt;&gt; GOOD TO BE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.827" end="00:00:30.697">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU ARE NOW THE LIBERTARIAN NOMINEE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.697" end="00:00:32.666">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M THE LIBERTARIAN NOMINEE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.666" end="00:00:37.271">I&apos;VE BEEN ONE OF THREE CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50 STATES-- OBAMA AND ROMNEY </p>
<p begin="00:00:37.271" end="00:00:38.505">BEING THE OTHER TWO.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.505" end="00:00:47.514">&gt;&gt; SO THIS IS BIG DOG STUFF.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.514" end="00:00:49.049">YOU WERE RUNNING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.049" end="00:00:50.050">OR TRYING TO GET ON...</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.050" end="00:00:51.285">&gt;&gt; KIND OF A MUTUAL THING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.285" end="00:00:54.821">THEY ASKED ME IF I WOULD CONSIDER RUNNING AND FOR THE MOST PART I THINK I&apos;M DELIVERING </p>
<p begin="00:00:54.821" end="00:01:00.160">A MESSAGE OF LIBERTY AND FREEDOM VERY MUCH ALONG THE SAME LINES AS RON PAUL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.160" end="00:01:06.400">I DON&apos;T THINK RON PAUL IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL GETTING THE NOMINATION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.400" end="00:01:07.768">&gt;&gt;NOMINATION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.768" end="00:01:08.535">&gt;&gt; Jon: REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.535" end="00:01:09.169">&gt;&gt; REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.169" end="00:01:13.073">SO THAT MESSAGE GOES AWAY WHEN HIS CANDIDACY COMES TO AN END.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.073" end="00:01:16.276">&gt;&gt; Jon: WAS THERE ANY THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD THEN GO TO THE...</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.276" end="00:01:21.648">DID DO THEY EVER TALK TO HIM OR IS THERE TALK OF THE TWO OF YOU OR IS THERE ANY THAT KIND OF...</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.648" end="00:01:23.083">&gt;&gt; NONE OF THAT GOING ON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.083" end="00:01:25.185">RON PAUL ASKED FOR MY ENDORSEMENT IN 2008.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.185" end="00:01:29.089">I READILY GAVE THAT ENDORSEMENT AND WHEN I DROPPED OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY I ASKED </p>
<p begin="00:01:29.089" end="00:01:32.392">EVERYONE THAT WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR ME TO VOTE FOR RON PAUL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.392" end="00:01:34.862">LIKE I SAY, I THINK THAT&apos;S GOING TO COME TO AN END.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.862" end="00:01:38.098">&gt;&gt; LIBERTARIAN IS VERY INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.098" end="00:01:41.134">DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS BOTH SEEM TO AGREE WITH HALF OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.134" end="00:01:41.635">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.635" end="00:01:43.470">&gt;&gt; BUT THE OPPOSITE HALVES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.470" end="00:01:44.371">&gt;&gt; I GOT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.371" end="00:01:48.108">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S LIKE ONE OF THOSE FRIENDSHIP NECKLACES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.108" end="00:01:52.980">EACH ONE HAS THE HALF AND IF THEY PUT IT TOGETHER, OH, MY GOD, A LIBERTARIAN!</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.980" end="00:01:53.347">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:53.347" end="00:01:54.147">&gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK SO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.147" end="00:02:02.222">THE NOTION THAT MOST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE, SOCIALLY TOLERANT,</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.222" end="00:02:04.758">I&apos;M IN THAT GROUP, I THINK MOST AMERICANS ARE IN THAT GROUP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.758" end="00:02:09.630">A LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE IS GOING TO COME AT OBAMA FROM THE LEFT AND COME AT ROMNEY FROM THE RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.630" end="00:02:11.665">KIND OF THAT NECKLACE THAT YOU&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.665" end="00:02:13.767">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHAT I&apos;M SAYING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.767" end="00:02:17.337">WHY IS IT LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATES HAVE TROUBLE, THEN, GAINING TRACTION?</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.337" end="00:02:22.276">EVEN THEN YOU WERE SAYING IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS NO ONE&apos;S GOTTEN MORE THAN 1% BUT THERE IS </p>
<p begin="00:02:22.276" end="00:02:29.516">VERY POPULAR POLICY WITHIN THOSE PARTY PLATFORMS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.516" end="00:02:31.351">&gt;&gt; I TOTALLY AGREE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.351" end="00:02:35.789">I TOTALLY AGREE THERE ARE MORE LIBERTARIANS, PEOPLE THAT DECLARE THEMSELVES LIBERTARIANS </p>
<p begin="00:02:35.789" end="00:02:37.191">THAN VOTE LIBERTARIAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.191" end="00:02:40.861">RIGHT NOW THOUGH YOU HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY SAYING THEY </p>
<p begin="00:02:40.861" end="00:02:43.964">WOULD CONSIDER VOTING FOR A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.964" end="00:02:53.640">WE&apos;LL SEE IF THAT TAKES PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.640" end="00:02:55.008">LET&apos;S BRING THE TROOPS HOME,</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.008" end="00:02:57.177">LET&apos;S BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.177" end="00:03:03.684">THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT HALF ARE EMBRACED BY THE DEMOCRATS HALF CAN BE EMBRACED </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.684" end="00:03:04.284">BY THE REPUBLICANS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.284" end="00:03:11.925">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT HOLDS IT BACK?</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.925" end="00:03:15.762">REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE I&apos;M FOR MAKE MIG OWN CHOICES AND THEN PEOPLE SCREW UP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.762" end="00:03:19.299">LET&apos;S FACE IT, YOU&apos;RE A MARATHONER, YOU&apos;VE CLIMBED </p>
<p begin="00:03:19.299" end="00:03:21.134">MOUNTAINS, YOU&apos;RE A GOVERNOR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.134" end="00:03:22.769">NOT ALL OF US CAN DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.769" end="00:03:24.872">SOME OF US LIKE DORIE TOES OR...</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.872" end="00:03:25.272">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.272" end="00:03:26.573">&gt;&gt; I DO, TOO, BY THE WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.573" end="00:03:27.307">(LAUGHS).</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.307" end="00:03:33.080">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT WHAT I&apos;M SUGGESTING IS LIBERTARIAN... IS THAT A GOOD PARTY FOR PEOPLE </p>
<p begin="00:03:33.080" end="00:03:37.651">THAT ARE PERHAPS NOT AS ABLE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.651" end="00:03:42.289">ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALWAYS STRUCK ME IS DO LIBERTARIANS PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN US?</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.289" end="00:03:47.094">ARE WE IMPRESSIVE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.094" end="00:03:49.630">&gt;&gt; HAVE THE TWO PARTIES GOTTEN SO OUT OF TOUCH?</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.630" end="00:03:54.701">AND PAPER, ROCK, SCISSORS, IF WE ELECT THE REPUBLICAN OR THE DEMOCRATS IS THERE GOING TO BE A </p>
<p begin="00:03:54.701" end="00:03:56.203">DIFFERENCE FOUR YEARS FROM NOW?</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.203" end="00:03:59.473">I DON&apos;T KNOW IF THERE&apos;S REALLY GOING TO BE A DIFFERENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.473" end="00:04:05.746">&gt;&gt; WELL, I WOULD SAY THERE WAS... THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LET&apos;S SAY GEORGE BUSH AND </p>
<p begin="00:04:05.746" end="00:04:10.817">WHOEVER THE DEMOCRAT WAS OR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBAMA AND WHO THE REPUBLICAN IS I THINK IS...</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.817" end="00:04:13.287">&gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU&apos;RE...</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.287" end="00:04:15.289">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT DISTANCE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.289" end="00:04:18.225">THOUGH, ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.225" end="00:04:21.295">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE IDENTICAL,</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.295" end="00:04:23.764">EACH HAS THEIR OWN PERHAPS STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.764" end="00:04:25.065">&gt;&gt; WELL, ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.065" end="00:04:30.671">AND LIKE I SAID HISTORICALLY I THINK PEOPLE HAVE EMBRACED THE DEMOCRAT PARTY BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE </p>
<p begin="00:04:30.671" end="00:04:32.272">GOOD ON CIVIL LIBERTIES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.272" end="00:04:36.710">I&apos;M GOING TO MAKE THE CASE THAT I&apos;M BETTER ON CIVIL LIBERTIES THAN OBAMA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.710" end="00:04:41.748">HISTORICALLY I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE ABOUT DOLLARS AND CENTS, THE CHECKBOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.748" end="00:04:44.117">HISTORICALLY REPUBLICANS ARE GOOD IN THAT CATEGORY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.117" end="00:04:48.555">BUT I&apos;LL NAME CASE THAT I&apos;M BETTER THAN ROMNEY WHEN IT COMES TO DOLLARS AND CENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.555" end="00:04:50.490">THAT&apos;S THE CASE I&apos;M GOING TO TRY AND MAKE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.490" end="00:04:52.159">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT CASE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.159" end="00:04:54.194">HOW DO YOU GET ON TO THE DEBATE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.194" end="00:05:00.367">HOW CAN YOU BECOME LIKE ROSS PRO DID AND GET INCLUDED IN THE NATIONAL DEBATE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.367" end="00:05:03.470">&gt;&gt; THE NOTION HERE IS TO ACTUALLY WIN THE RACE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.470" end="00:05:05.205">THAT&apos;S THE PIE IN THE SKY NOTION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.205" end="00:05:11.645">TO DO THAT, I&apos;VE GOT TO POLL AT 15% TO GET ON THE NATIONAL DEBATE STAGE WITH OBAMA AND ROMNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.645" end="00:05:14.681">RIGHT NOW I&apos;M POLLING AT ABOUT 8% AGAINST THE TWO OF THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.681" end="00:05:15.482">I THINK MORE IMPORTANT...</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.482" end="00:05:16.683">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOLD ON.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.683" end="00:05:17.084">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:17.084" end="00:05:22.656">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M JUST WORKING THIS OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.656" end="00:05:28.695">&gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST INGREDIENT IN MY BEING 8% IS THAT I&apos;M THE THIRD NAME LISTED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.695" end="00:05:29.429">NOT SO MUCH ME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.429" end="00:05:31.064">BUT THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.064" end="00:05:33.066">THERE WILL ONLY BE THREE CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.066" end="00:05:34.735">&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO GET TO 15%.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.735" end="00:05:35.502">WHOSE RULE IS THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.502" end="00:05:39.973">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE COMMISSION THAT ESTABLISHED THAT AS A RESULT OF </p>
<p begin="00:05:39.973" end="00:05:42.109">ROSS PEROT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.109" end="00:05:43.076">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, REALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.076" end="00:05:44.178">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.178" end="00:05:47.514">&gt;&gt; Jon: BECAUSE THEY WON&apos;T WE DON&apos;T WANT ANOTHER CRACKPOT IN HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.514" end="00:05:48.448">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.448" end="00:05:53.487">&gt;&gt; Jon: (AS ROSS PEROT) &quot;HERE&apos;S WHAT YOU&apos;VE GOT TO DO.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:53.487" end="00:05:55.923">&gt;&gt; SO LET&apos;S SET A 15% THRESHOLD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.923" end="00:05:58.425">SO LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE WORLD A LITTLE BIT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.425" end="00:06:02.262">&gt;&gt; DO YOU... HAVE YOU FOUND WHEN YOU&apos;RE TALKING TO PEOPLE THEY&apos;RE </p>
<p begin="00:06:02.262" end="00:06:06.733">MORE OPEN TO IT WHERE YOU GO OUT AND KNOW THERE&apos;S ALSO R.C. COLA,</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.733" end="00:06:08.268">ALSO VERY TASTED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.268" end="00:06:11.638">(LAUGHTER) WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE THEY...</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.638" end="00:06:11.939">RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.939" end="00:06:16.043">DO THEY SAY OH, MY GOD, I NEVER TASTED LIBERTARIANISM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.043" end="00:06:17.544">LET ME... OH, OH!</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.544" end="00:06:19.479">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S THE OPPORTUNITY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.479" end="00:06:26.086">THE NOTION THAT PERHAPS LIBERTARIANS EMBRACE WHAT MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY... YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.086" end="00:06:31.959">IT&apos;S ONE THING TO PHILOSOPHICALLY BE IN TUNE WITH THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.959" end="00:06:35.262">IT&apos;S ANOTHER THING TO ACTUALLY POINT OUT THE PROBLEMS THAT FACE THE COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.262" end="00:06:39.533">I THINK A HOMELESS PERSON COULD DO THOSE TWO... THOSE SAME THINGS BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO </p>
<p begin="00:06:39.533" end="00:06:45.072">HAVE A RESUME TO ACTUALLY DO THIS AND I&apos;M POSING MYSELF AS HAVING THAT RESUME ALSO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.072" end="00:06:50.244">HAVING SERVED TWO TERMS AS GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO IN A STATE THAT&apos;S 2-1 DEMOCRAT AND </p>
<p begin="00:06:50.244" end="00:06:55.415">TAKEN ON ISSUES THAT I THINK WERE REALLY IMPORTANT AND POLITICS BE DAMNED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.415" end="00:06:58.452">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M GLAD THAT YOU GAVE THOSE IMPRESSIVE CREDENTIALS </p>
<p begin="00:06:58.452" end="00:07:02.556">BECAUSE AT FIRST I THOUGHT WHAT YOU WERE SAYING WAS &quot;HEY, MAN,</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.556" end="00:07:05.626">I&apos;M BETTER THAN A HOMELESS GUY!&quot; I WASN&apos;T SURE AT FIRST WHERE YOU </p>
