<p begin="00:00:06.573" end="00:00:10.277">NOW IF YOU ARE LIKE ME, AND I&apos;M SURE THAT YOU ARE -- </p>
<p begin="00:00:10.277" end="00:00:10.711">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.711" end="00:00:16.650">-- EVERY YEAR YOU MAKE A NEW YEAR&apos;S RESOLUTION TO MAKE YOU YOUR CHILDREN LOSE WEIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.650" end="00:00:17.084">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.084" end="00:00:23.657">AND IF yOt LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO STICKING TO THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT TO GET A LOT EASIER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.657" end="00:00:25.425">AASIF MANDVI HAS MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.425" end="00:00:26.927">&gt;&gt; CHILDHOOD OBESITY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.927" end="00:00:34.601">IT&apos;S A DEVASTATING PROBLEM EFFECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US, HEADLESS CHILDREN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.601" end="00:00:40.240">FORTUNATELY THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS FOUND A WAY TO SOLVE THE VEXING OBESITY CRISIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.240" end="00:00:46.146">&gt;&gt; SAN FRANCISCO IS BASICALLY BANNING HAPPY MEALS THENCH VOTED TO BAN TOYS FROM HAPPY MEALS </p>
<p begin="00:00:46.146" end="00:00:48.849">THAT DON&apos;T MEET NUTRITIONAL STANDARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.849" end="00:00:49.783">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.783" end="00:00:59.126">UNDER THE GNAW WILL YOU ALL FAST FOOD MEALS NEED TO HAVE LESS THAN 600 CALORIES AND CONTAIN </p>
<p begin="00:00:59.126" end="00:01:01.828">FRUITS AND VEGETABLES TO GET A TOY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.828" end="00:01:07.367">THE COUNCILMAN PUSHED THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION SHOWING THE TOY IS THE HEALTHIEST THING IN THE MEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.367" end="00:01:16.643">&gt;&gt; McDONALDS AND BURGER KING USED TOYS TO LURE KIDS, TOYS ATTACHED TO MEALS FOR FOODS THAT </p>
<p begin="00:01:16.643" end="00:01:17.811">IS VERY BAD FOR THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.811" end="00:01:19.079">&gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.079" end="00:01:24.685">WHAT YOU ARE BASICALLY TELLING US IS:  GUESS WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.685" end="00:01:25.752">McDONALDS FOOD IS (bleep).</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.752" end="00:01:26.286">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.286" end="00:01:27.187">&gt;&gt; DUH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.187" end="00:01:31.191">&gt;&gt; IF THERE&apos;S NO TOY THE KIDS WOULDN&apos;T EAT THE MEALS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.191" end="00:01:32.459">NO, OF COURSE THEY WOULDN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.459" end="00:01:39.666">AS OUR HIDDEN CAMERA SHOT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A SIX-YEAR-OLD SHOWS THERE&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:01:39.666" end="00:01:51.144">NOTHING APPEALING AT McDONALDS EXCEPT THE MILKSHAKE, THE FRIES AND THE McNUGGET�MS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.144" end="00:01:55.782">YOU SAID TO GET YOUR TOY YOU HAVE TO EAT YOUR FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.782" end="00:02:00.554">WE WANT HEALTHIER OPTIONS IF THEY WANT TO ATTACH A TOY TO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.554" end="00:02:04.825">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S WHAT I JUST SAID.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.825" end="00:02:08.195">YOU JUST SAID THE SAME THING I JUST SAID.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.195" end="00:02:18.238">OF COURSE, IN SAN FRANCISCO YOU GET YOUR COUNTER CULTURE RADICAL COMPLAINING LIKE MYER GAVIN NEWSOME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.238" end="00:02:19.606">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A BAD IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.606" end="00:02:21.608">WE&apos;RE GETTING INTO PRIVATE BUSINESS DECISIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.608" end="00:02:27.414">IT&apos;S NOT THE ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF KIDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.414" end="00:02:31.118">IT&apos;S THE ROLE OF PARENTS TO DECIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.118" end="00:02:33.987">&gt;&gt; YOU ARE REALLY GOOD LOOKING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.987" end="00:02:34.988">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.988" end="00:02:39.092">&gt;&gt; WHAT THE MAYOR SEEMS TO HAVE LOST SIGHT OF IS IT&apos;S REALLY ALL ABOUT THE CHILDREN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.092" end="00:02:45.499">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS THE WORST THING THAT THEY HAVE EVER DONE AND </p>
<p begin="00:02:45.499" end="00:02:48.368">THEY DON&apos;T START GIVING OUT THE TOYS, GOODBYE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.368" end="00:02:50.971">YOU GUYS JUST DON&apos;T GET IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.971" end="00:02:53.473">THESE TOYS ARE MAKING YOU FAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.473" end="00:02:54.441">HOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGH?</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.441" end="00:02:56.243">&gt;&gt; 52 POUNDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.243" end="00:02:58.779">&gt;&gt; YOU COULD BE 50.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.779" end="00:02:59.213">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.213" end="00:03:05.452">WITH SO MUCH AT RISK, THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS TO STEP IN OR IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR </p>
<p begin="00:03:05.452" end="00:03:07.087">CHILDREN TO KNOW WHAT IS BAD FOR THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.087" end="00:03:13.460">&gt;&gt; MY TEN-YEAR-OLD HAS HAD A NUMBER OF HAPPY MEALS GROWING UP </p>
<p begin="00:03:13.460" end="00:03:18.465">BUT SHE&apos;S WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE FOOD IS UNHEALTHY FOR HER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.465" end="00:03:20.300">&gt;&gt; HOW DOES SHE FIGURE THAT OUT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.300" end="00:03:23.637">&gt;&gt; I THINK SHE WATCHES SUPERSIZED WITH ME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.637" end="00:03:25.873">&gt;&gt; SO SHE LEARNED FROM HER PARENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.873" end="00:03:28.709">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A LARGE PART OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.709" end="00:03:42.656">&gt;&gt; WOULD IT BE HARD TO PASS A LAW TO FORCE NETFELIX -- NETFLIX TO SEND SUPERSIZE ME TO EVERY HOME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.656" end="00:03:45.959">&gt;&gt; YOU CAN&apos;T FORCE A PRIVATE COMPANY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.959" end="00:03:50.764">&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW STPH-FPLG WE HAVE NO POWER TO FORCE A PRIVATE COMPANY LIKE </p>
<p begin="00:03:50.764" end="00:03:54.301">THAT TO CHANGE A BUSINESS PRACTICE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.301" end="00:03:54.735">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.735" end="00:04:00.207">&gt;&gt; SO ON ONE HAND YOU ARE LIKE WE CAN&apos;T DO THAT BUT ON THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:00.207" end="00:04:01.542">OTHER HAND, YOU ARE DOING THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.542" end="00:04:03.243">&gt;&gt; WE DON&apos;T HAVE THAT KIND OF POWER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.243" end="00:04:05.179">&gt;&gt; YOU JUST SAID YOU DID.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.179" end="00:04:14.621">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE LOOKING AT FOOD FROM A FOOD ENVIRONMENT ISSUES FROM AN EQUITYABILITY -- </p>
<p begin="00:04:14.621" end="00:04:15.055">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.055" end="00:04:18.125">&gt;&gt; THE LAW TAKES EFFECT LATER THIS YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.125" end="00:04:25.566">WITH NO MORE HAPPY MEALS IN SAN FRANCISCO WE CAN ONLY HOPE THEY&apos;LL LOVE THE BRAND NEW </p>
<p begin="00:04:25.566" end="00:04:26.233">CRAPPY MEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.233" end="00:04:34.074">IT HAS A PERIODIc� TABLE OF ELEMENTS, DVR INSTRUCTIONS AND AN ACTION FIGURE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.074" end="00:04:41.515">IT&apos;S SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES KATHLEEN IS A BEALOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.515" end="00:04:41.949">LOOK -- </p>
<p begin="00:04:41.949" end="00:04:46.320">&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW WE HAVE MORE CHILDREN WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT AND </p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:51.258">OBESE THAN WE&apos;VE EVER HAD BEFORE IN THIS NATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.258" end="00:04:54.127">&gt;&gt; IN ALL THIS THERE&apos;S ONE THING HURTING CHILDREN THE MOST.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.127" end="00:04:56.196">&gt;&gt; TAKE THIS OFF YOUR FACE NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.196" end="00:04:57.130">IT WON&apos;T HURT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.130" end="00:04:58.932">REALLY FAST.</p>
