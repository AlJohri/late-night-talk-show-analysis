<p begin="00:00:06.940" end="00:00:08.542">MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHOR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.542" end="00:00:11.512">HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED TURN RIGHT AT MACHU PICCHU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.512" end="00:00:13.614">REDISCOVERING THE LOST CITY ONE STEP AT A TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.614" end="00:00:15.582">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MARK ADAMS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.582" end="00:00:16.583">SIR!</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.583" end="00:00:22.523">NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.523" end="00:00:24.291">THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.291" end="00:00:25.359">&gt;&gt; A PLEASURE TO BE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.359" end="00:00:34.101">&gt;&gt; Jon: I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE MACHU PICCHU WAS SO... I GUESS CONTROVERSIAL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.101" end="00:00:40.908">THAT IT NEEDED TO BE THAT THE GENTLEMAN WHO DISCOVERED IT I GUESS WAS HIRAM BINGHAM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.908" end="00:00:45.913">&gt;&gt; HE WAS A YALE LECTURER WHO FOUND IT JUST ABOUT 100 YEARS AGO EXACTLY AND CAUSED A </p>
<p begin="00:00:45.913" end="00:00:49.683">LITTLE CONTROVERSY BECAUSE HE LATER TOOK FULL CREDIT FOR FINDING MACHU PICCHU AND LEFT </p>
<p begin="00:00:49.683" end="00:00:53.820">OUT THE FACT THAT THERE WERE THREE FAMILIES OF FARMERS LIVING UP GROWING TOMATOES </p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:55.556">AMONG THE RUINS WHEN HE GOT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.556" end="00:00:57.024">HE CAME BACK A YEAR LATER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.024" end="00:01:00.894">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO NATIVE PEOPLE COUNT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.894" end="00:01:03.463">&gt;&gt; THAT IS PART OF THE CONTROVERSY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.463" end="00:01:08.969">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND YOU DECIDED TO RETRACE BINGHAM&apos;S PATH TO MACHU PICCHU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.969" end="00:01:10.304">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.304" end="00:01:16.210">HE DID A FAMOUS EXPEDITION IN 1911 ON WHICH HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE LOST CITY OF THE INCAS </p>
<p begin="00:01:16.210" end="00:01:23.083">WHICH WAS THIS LEGENDARY CITY THAT MANY BELIEVE THAT A GROUP OF INCA NOBLES HAD RUN OFF TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:23.083" end="00:01:28.956">WITH ALL THE TREASURES OF THE EMPIRE WHEN PIZARRO ARRIVED IN 1532.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.956" end="00:01:31.625">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS WAS TO ESCAPE THE SPANISH AND THEIR TAKEOVER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.625" end="00:01:35.629">&gt;&gt; THE CON QUIST TO DORES WHO ARRIVED, EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.629" end="00:01:40.100">HE ALSO GOT A HOT TIP THAT THERE MIGHT BE COOL RUINS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.100" end="00:01:42.603">&gt;&gt; Jon: A HOT TIP ON COOL RUINS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.603" end="00:01:48.408">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.408" end="00:01:51.278">YOU HAVEN&apos;T READ &quot;NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC&quot; IN A WHILE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.278" end="00:01:55.582">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW THIS BINGHAM WAS WRITING FOR &quot;NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.582" end="00:01:59.920">HE REALLY PUT THEM FOR LACK OF A BETTER PUN ON THE MAP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.920" end="00:02:04.057">&gt;&gt; &quot;NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC&quot; WAS A FAIRLY SMALL MAGAZINE BEFORE MACHU PICCHU CAME OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.057" end="00:02:06.627">THEY DEVOTED A WHOLE ISSUE TO IT IN 1913.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.627" end="00:02:09.062">IT WAS A MAJOR SUCCESS FOR EVERYBODY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.062" end="00:02:12.866">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT YOU FOUND ON THERE, HOW LONG DID YOU SPEND TREKING TO MACHU PICCHU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.866" end="00:02:17.070">&gt;&gt; WITH MY GUIDE JOHN AND THREE MULE TENDERS AND A COOK,</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.070" end="00:02:22.509">WE WENT AROUND FOR ABOUT A MONTH THROUGH THE ANDES OF PERU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.509" end="00:02:25.412">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW HARD IS IT TO BECOME A MULE TENDER?</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.412" end="00:02:30.083">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S A LICENSING PROCESS BECAUSE JOHN </p>
<p begin="00:02:30.083" end="00:02:35.189">ON OUR FIRST DAY OUT GAVE ME A BIG LECTURE ABOUT HOW NOT TO GET KICKED BY A MULE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.189" end="00:02:42.095">ABOUT AN HOUR LATER THE MULE TENDERS CAME BACK AND SAID HE JUST GOT KICKED BY THE MULE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.095" end="00:02:45.699">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW YOU MUST PARDON ME FOR THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.699" end="00:02:50.237">YOU DON&apos;T STRIKE ME AS SO MUCH OF THE EXPLORER TYPE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.237" end="00:02:56.610">SO THIS STRIKES ME THE HARDSHIP OF THE ANDES WITH THE LACK OF BREATHEABLE AIR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.610" end="00:02:57.978">VERY THIN OXYGEN UP THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.978" end="00:02:58.445">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.445" end="00:03:01.548">&gt;&gt; Jon: WAS IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.548" end="00:03:05.652">&gt;&gt; IT WAS UNTIL WE DISCOVERED THE MAGIC OF COCOA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.652" end="00:03:07.421">THE COCOA LEAVES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.421" end="00:03:12.659">WE HAD TO KEEP STOPPING AND BUYING THESE LARGE BAGS WHICH THEY LOOKED LIKE BAY LEAVES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.659" end="00:03:14.528">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M FAMILIAR WITH...</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.528" end="00:03:18.465">(LAUGHING) NO NEED, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.465" end="00:03:24.171">&gt;&gt; I WAS HOPING TO GET LIKE A LITTLE OF THAT TONY MONTANA ACTION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.171" end="00:03:28.809">IT&apos;S MORE LIKE HAVING A NICE CUP OF TEA UNFORTUNATELY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.809" end="00:03:31.245">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO THE MULE TENDERS APPRECIATED THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.245" end="00:03:34.515">SO YOU FIND OUT, WHAT DO YOU FIND OUT NOW ABOUT BEING...</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.515" end="00:03:37.851">THE PEOPLE IN PERU ARE ANGRY AT THIS MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.851" end="00:03:39.953">THEY SAY HE STOLE THEIR ARTIFACTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.953" end="00:03:41.755">WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER ABOUT THINGS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.755" end="00:03:42.356">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.356" end="00:03:46.660">HE DID HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT OF PERU THAT HE WOULD TAKE THESE ARTIFACTS </p>
<p begin="00:03:46.660" end="00:03:51.465">FROM MACHU PICCHU UP TO THE PEABODY MUSEUM AT YALE AND BRING THEM BACK WHENEVER PERU </p>
<p begin="00:03:51.465" end="00:03:52.699">ASKED FOR THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.699" end="00:03:56.703">PERU STARTED ASKING FOR THEM A FEW YEARS AGO AND YALE BASICALLY SAID, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.703" end="00:03:59.873">WE&apos;VE HAD THIS STUFF IN OUR BASEMENT FOR A LONG TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.873" end="00:04:02.176">YOU&apos;RE GOING TO ASK FOR IT BACK NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.176" end="00:04:04.044">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY&apos;RE NOT EVEN DISPLAYING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.044" end="00:04:04.878">IT&apos;S IN THEIR BASEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.878" end="00:04:06.647">&gt;&gt; MOST OF IT IS IN THEIR BASEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.647" end="00:04:08.248">THEY&apos;RE STUDYING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.248" end="00:04:11.752">MOST OF IT IS POTTERY FRAGMENTS AND HUMAN REMAINS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.752" end="00:04:17.891">&gt;&gt; Jon: MOST OF IT IS THE ANCESTORS OF THE PEOPLE REQUESTING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.891" end="00:04:20.427">&gt;&gt; BUT IT&apos;S NOT KING TUT&apos;S TREASURE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.427" end="00:04:22.563">BUT BECAUSE IT IS THAT STUFF,</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.563" end="00:04:26.533">IT WAS A BIG DEAL FOR PERUIANS TO GET IT BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.533" end="00:04:30.137">YALE AGREED TO SEND IT BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.137" end="00:04:37.845">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE GENTLEMAN WHO DID FIND IT BEFORE HIM, THIS BURNS FELLOW....</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.845" end="00:04:42.282">&gt;&gt; HE WAS BASICALLY JUST THERE TO STEAL ARTIFACTS AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.282" end="00:04:44.651">WE DON&apos;T KNOW IF HE WAS SUCCESSFUL OR NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.651" end="00:04:46.787">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE WAS THERE 40 YEARS BEFORE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.787" end="00:04:47.354">&gt;&gt; 1867.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.354" end="00:04:50.424">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE ALSO PROBABLY FOUND THE COCOA LEAVES I WOULD MANAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.424" end="00:04:53.360">&gt;&gt; HE ALSO PROBABLY FOUND COCOA LEAVES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:58.932">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU MET SOME OF THESE FOLKS AT THE EXPLORERS CLUB.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.932" end="00:05:01.568">IS THAT A REAL PLACE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.568" end="00:05:04.204">&gt;&gt; THE EXPLORERS CLUB IS A REAL PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.204" end="00:05:10.244">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO THE PEOPLE AT THE DOOR EVER GO, WELL, HOW DID YOU FIND US?</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.244" end="00:05:17.050">THAT WOULD BE A FUNNY EXPLORERS&apos; JOKE THAT THEY COULD DO OVER AND OVER AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.050" end="00:05:18.485">&gt;&gt; I THINK THEY PROBABLY DO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.485" end="00:05:19.553">I DON&apos;T KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.553" end="00:05:21.054">IT&apos;S NEVER BEEN PULLED ON ME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.054" end="00:05:22.489">THEN I LOOK LIKE THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.489" end="00:05:23.590">&gt;&gt; Jon: STOP IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.590" end="00:05:24.691">CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.691" end="00:05:33.200">YOU LOOK LIKE, IF DREW CARY MARRIED JOHN HODGMAN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.200" end="00:05:37.070">THAT ONE IS GOING TO HAUNT YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.070" end="00:05:39.239">BY THE WAY REALLY ENTERTAINING WRITING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.239" end="00:05:40.607">REALLY FUNNY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.607" end="00:05:41.575">REALLY INTERESTING STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.575" end="00:05:43.110">YOU GUYS SHOULD PICK IT UP.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.110" end="00:05:44.912">IT&apos;S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.</p>
