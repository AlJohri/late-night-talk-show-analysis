<p begin="00:08:44.358" end="00:08:46.627">YOU, THOUGH, SEEM TON WHAT YOU&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.627" end="00:08:47.060">HOW ABOUT?</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.060" end="00:08:49.830">&gt;&gt; MY PROBLEM IS I WAS ARRESTED AND PUT IN JAIL FOR THREE MONTHS </p>
<p begin="00:08:49.830" end="00:08:54.368">FOR GROWING MARIJUANA AND GOT TWO CONSPIRACY CHARGE BECAUSE I HAD TWO ROOMMATES LIVING WITH ME.</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.368" end="00:08:55.068">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S MESSED UP.</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.068" end="00:08:57.271">&gt;&gt; I HAVE THREE FELONIES ON MY RECORD NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.271" end="00:09:02.576">&gt;&gt; HOLD ON FOR WHEREON SECOND.</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.576" end="00:09:07.514"> ONE SECOND-- QUICK QUESTION, HAVE ANY PRESIDENTS EVER BEEN ELECTED WITH A FELONY ON THEIR RECORDS?</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.514" end="00:09:08.515">&gt;&gt; NOT THEY KNOW OF.</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.515" end="00:09:11.818">&gt;&gt; THIS GUY GOT BUSTED AND HE NOW CAN&apos;T BE PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.818" end="00:09:13.754">&gt;&gt; WELL, IT SUCTION FOR THIS GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.754" end="00:09:15.622">HE GOT CAUGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.622" end="00:09:18.025">OBAMA DIDN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.025" end="00:09:23.030">&gt;&gt; I GOTTA BE HONEST-- IT&apos;S NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR YOU TO BE PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.030" end="00:09:28.602">&gt;&gt; YES, I KNOW, EVEN THOUGH OBAMA AND I DID THE SAME THING AT THE SAME AGE, THE DIFFERENCE </p>
<p begin="00:09:28.602" end="00:09:31.805">IS THAT I ACTUALLY SPENT THREE MONTHS IN JAIL.</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.805" end="00:09:34.842">&gt;&gt; SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU&apos;RE SAYING IS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS </p>
<p begin="00:09:34.842" end="00:09:40.280">ISSUE, THE PRESIDENT&apos;S NOT A KIND BUD.</p>
