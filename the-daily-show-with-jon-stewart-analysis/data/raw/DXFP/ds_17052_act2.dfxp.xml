<p begin="00:00:19.019" end="00:00:22.990">CAN HE WIN THE SUPPORT OF A DEMOGRAPHIC EVEN GREATER IN NUMBER IN THE SUNSHINE STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.990" end="00:00:25.292">WE SENT JASON JONES TO MIAMI TO FIND OUT.</p>

<p begin="00:00:47.080" end="00:00:49.116">&gt;&gt; BOTTOM LINE HE&apos;S NOT TRUST WORTHY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.116" end="00:00:52.920">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT&apos;S FOOLISH OF OTHER POOM TO TRUST SOMEBODY WITH HIS HISTORY.</p>

<p begin="00:01:41.735" end="00:01:42.803">&gt;&gt; HE&apos;S A CATHOLIC NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.803" end="00:01:44.905">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S A LOT OF HYPOCRITES IN THIS WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.905" end="00:01:48.642">&gt;&gt; WHEN HE LEFT THE SECOND WIFE WITH M.S., IT DIDN&apos;T SURPRISE ME BECAUSE HE HAD </p>
