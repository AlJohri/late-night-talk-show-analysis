<p begin="00:00:03.136" end="00:00:07.207">&gt;&gt; COMING UP ON THE SHOW,</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.207" end="00:00:11.278">OUR INSATIABLE SEARCH FOR OIL HAS FORCED TO US DO BUSINESS WITH SOME OF THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:11.278" end="00:00:12.980">WORLD&apos;S POST DANGEROUS REGIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.980" end="00:00:18.018">IT TURNS OUT THE MOST DANGEROUS MAY BE CLOSER THAN WE THINK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.018" end="00:00:19.520">WYATT CENAC HAS MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.520" end="00:00:22.656">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;VE BEEN TOLD TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE MUST GET OFF FOREIGN OIL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.656" end="00:00:27.427">&gt;&gt; AMERICA&apos;S DEPENDNESS ON OIL IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS OUR NATION FACES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.427" end="00:00:31.865">&gt;&gt; IT LEAVES US MORE VULNERABLE TO HOSTILE REGIMES AND TO TERRORISTS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.865" end="00:00:36.937">&gt;&gt; BUT IF WE&apos;RE GOING TO GET SERIOUS WE MUST EXAMINE THE PLAYERS, PARTICULARLY THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:36.937" end="00:00:40.040">BIGGEST, MOST DANGEROUS PLAYER OF ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.040" end="00:00:45.145">&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW OUR LEADING SUPPLIER OF IMPORTED OIL IS CANADA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.145" end="00:00:50.617">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT, IT&apos;S CANADA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.617" end="00:00:55.155">&gt;&gt; IT GIVES US ABOUT $2 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL A DAY WHICH IS ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH </p>
<p begin="00:00:55.155" end="00:00:57.791">AS WE ARE CURRENTLY GETTING FROM SAUDI ARABIA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.791" end="00:00:58.192">&gt;&gt; CANADA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.192" end="00:00:58.825">I KNEW IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.825" end="00:01:04.398">FOR TOO LONG WE&apos;VE COZIED UP TO THEIR DICTATORS, OPENED OUR BORDERS TO THEIR </p>
<p begin="00:01:04.398" end="00:01:07.801">MOST-- AND IGNORED THEIR INSTITUTIONAL BRUTALITY,</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.801" end="00:01:12.506">AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN-- OH, THAT&apos;S GOT TO HURT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.506" end="00:01:16.577">YES, BIT BY BIT CANADA IS KILLING US.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.577" end="00:01:23.183">&gt;&gt; I FLEW TO THE OIL FIELDS OF ALBERTA TO CONFRONT OUR CANADIAN OIL OVERLORDS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.183" end="00:01:29.690">&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU PREFER THAT I CALL YOU SHEIKH OR WAR LORD OR YOUR LORDSHIP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.690" end="00:01:32.626">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT BUT YOU CAN JUST CALL ME DREW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.626" end="00:01:39.433">&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU AGREE THAT CANADA IS A BLOOD AND OIL SOAKED -- </p>
<p begin="00:01:39.433" end="00:01:42.269">&gt;&gt; NO CANADA IS A VERY WELCOMING, WARM COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.269" end="00:01:45.239">THERE IS NO REASON WE CAN&apos;T CONTINUE TO BE GREAT NEIGHBORS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.239" end="00:01:46.240">&gt;&gt; SUCH ARROGANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:52.746">AND WORSE, IT&apos;S AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT ARE KEEPING THESE OIL BARRONS IN BUSINESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.746" end="00:01:57.317">SOMEONE HAS TO SEND THEM A MESSAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.317" end="00:02:04.958">&gt;&gt; FIRST QUESTION, WELL,</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.958" end="00:02:09.062">EVIL CANADA, WE&apos;VE BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH CANADA FOR MANY YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.062" end="00:02:13.700">WE MAY HAVE SMALL DIFFERENCES BUT WE ARE REALLY CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.700" end="00:02:15.736">&gt;&gt; REALLY, YOU&apos;RE OKAY WITH CANADA?</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.736" end="00:02:17.504">&gt;&gt; CANADA&apos;S FINE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.504" end="00:02:24.344">&gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOUR DAUGHTER HAD HER HEALTH CARE PAID FOR BY THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.344" end="00:02:26.680">AS A FATHER HOW YOU COULD LIVE WITH YOURSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.680" end="00:02:28.715">&gt;&gt; I COULD LIVE WITH THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.715" end="00:02:31.919">&gt;&gt; AND YOU CALL YOURSELF AN AMERICAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.919" end="00:02:34.454">&gt;&gt; YOU DISGUST ME, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.454" end="00:02:40.360">ALSO, DO YOU HAVE SOME KLEENEX BECAUSE I&apos;M STARTING TO CON GUIL A LITTLE BIT HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.360" end="00:02:45.399">&gt;&gt; SURE THE PROPAGANDA SOUNDS GREAT, UNTIL YOU TALK TO THOSE WHO HAVE MANAGED TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:45.399" end="00:02:47.835">ESCAPE THE EVIL MAP EL REGIME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.835" end="00:02:51.104">&gt;&gt; SO YOU ARE CANADIAN REFUGEES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.104" end="00:02:55.742">&gt;&gt; AH, WE WERE BORN AND RAISED IN TORONTO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.742" end="00:03:01.882">&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT LIKE LIVING IN THAT REPRESSIVE REGIME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.882" end="00:03:04.084">&gt;&gt; OH, WHAT&apos;S THIS SHOW ALL ABOUT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.084" end="00:03:05.485">&gt;&gt; YEAH WHAT IS ABOUT IT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.485" end="00:03:10.290">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.290" end="00:03:10.624">&gt;&gt; OH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.624" end="00:03:13.694">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S THAT SHOW WHERE THEY MAKE YOU LOOK SILLY ON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.694" end="00:03:15.229">&gt;&gt; MAKE YOU LOOK STUPID.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.229" end="00:03:17.431">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE JUST A BUNCH OF CANADIAN STOOGES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.431" end="00:03:18.799">&gt;&gt; NO, TAKEOFF, EH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.799" end="00:03:21.835">GO HOME, YANKEE, EH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.835" end="00:03:26.607">&gt;&gt; I FELT THAT SAME ANGER ON THE CANADIAN STREET WHERE AMERICA HAS BECOME THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:26.607" end="00:03:29.343">SCAPEGOAT FOR ALL OF CANADA&apos;S PROBLEMS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.343" end="00:03:32.145">&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU ANGRY AT AMERICA?</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.145" end="00:03:33.981">&gt;&gt; A LOT OF REASONS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.981" end="00:03:36.884">NUMBER ONE, VANCOUVER CANUCKS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.884" end="00:03:39.353">WE WANT THE IN ORDERIQUE BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.353" end="00:03:42.089">YOU TOOK THE WIN BEG, THAT WAS TOO MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.089" end="00:03:43.357">BULLY SKOAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.357" end="00:03:44.391">YOU A HOCKEY FAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.391" end="00:03:49.396">&gt;&gt; NO, I&apos;M AMERICAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.396" end="00:03:53.367">&gt;&gt; HERE A NEW GENERATION OF CANUCKO FACISTS ARE BEING TRAINED TO HATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.367" end="00:03:56.637">CLEARLY IT&apos;S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY STRIKE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.637" end="00:04:00.707">&gt;&gt; I THINK THEY&apos;RE MORE AFRAID OF US THAN WE ARE OF THEM TO BE HONEST.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.707" end="00:04:04.311">&gt;&gt; SO ARE YOU SAYING WE SHOULD INVADE CANADA BEFORE CANADA INVADES US?</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.311" end="00:04:08.549">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S ALL I NEED RIGHT THERE, YES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.549" end="00:04:12.352">&gt;&gt; AS AMERICANS WE SIMPLY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.352" end="00:04:13.520">&gt;&gt; AMERICANS HAVE A CHOICE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.520" end="00:04:14.721">A PERSONAL CHOICE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.721" end="00:04:19.159">EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS A CHOICE TO USE FOSSIL FUELS OR NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.159" end="00:04:20.527">&gt;&gt; DONE, ALL RIGHT, EASY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.527" end="00:04:21.528">WE&apos;LL STOP USING YOUR OIL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.528" end="00:04:24.932">&gt;&gt; LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN, THOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.932" end="00:04:26.300">OBVIOUS TRANSPORTATION MEANS WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.300" end="00:04:28.735">YOUR CELL PHONE, VIDEO GAMES,</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.735" end="00:04:30.437">MP3 PLAYERS, YOUR I PADS,</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.437" end="00:04:33.874">ALL THESE THINGS ARE MADE FROM A PETROCHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM-BASED PRODUCTS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.874" end="00:04:35.809">&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT INTERNET PORN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.809" end="00:04:37.611">&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE GONE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.611" end="00:04:42.683">&gt;&gt; I WAS BEGINNING TO SEE POLITICS IN A WHOLE NEW LIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.683" end="00:04:46.720">MAYBE CANADA WASN&apos;T SO BAD AFTER ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:51.725">&gt;&gt; O CANADA &#x266A; &#x266A; CANADA &#x266A; &#x266A; CANADA &#x266A; </p>
<p begin="00:04:51.725" end="00:04:52.926">&#x266A; MEOW, MEOW, MEOW &#x266A; </p>
