<p begin="00:00:14.815" end="00:00:20.220">FULLY REVISED AND UPDATED, THE NEW EDITION IS CALLED &quot;THE POST-AMERICAN WORLD RELEASE </p>
<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:23.524">2.0.&quot; PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM FAREED ZAKARIA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.524" end="00:00:34.101">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.101" end="00:00:39.006">&gt;&gt; I LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR TEN MINUTES AFTER THE GREEN ROOM AND YOU DESTROY YOURSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.006" end="00:00:41.041">&gt;&gt; Jon: I AM AN IDIOT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.041" end="00:00:43.310">I REALLY AM AN IDIOT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.310" end="00:00:44.811">I&apos;M A BARTENDER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.811" end="00:00:47.181">HOW MANY YEARS HAVE I BAR TENDED...</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.181" end="00:00:48.649">&gt;&gt; YOU WERE A BARTENDER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.649" end="00:00:52.085">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M SMASHING GLASSES AGAINST THE PODIUM THINKING &quot;WHAT WILL HAPPEN?</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.085" end="00:00:54.888">I DON&apos;T KNOW.&quot; (LAUGHTER) NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.888" end="00:00:56.456">&gt;&gt; Jon: PLEASURE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.456" end="00:00:58.926">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE GOT SO MUCH GOING ON IN THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.926" end="00:01:00.427">NORMALLY WE TALK FOREIGN POLICY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.427" end="00:01:07.401">I WANT TO TALK OUR ECONOMY IN RELATION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.401" end="00:01:08.735">HAVE WE FALLEN BEHIND?</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.735" end="00:01:11.705">ARE WE THE ECONOMIC SUPERPOWER WE ONCE WERE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.705" end="00:01:15.342">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE STILL THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD BY FAR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.342" end="00:01:18.412">BUT THERE&apos;S A BIG DIFFERENCE EMERGING RIGHT NOW IN THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.412" end="00:01:21.481">IF YOU LOOK AT AMERICAN CORPORATIONS ARE DOING FANTASTIC.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.481" end="00:01:26.086">THEY HAVE ACCESS TO CHEAP CAPITAL, THEY CAN FIND CHEAP LABOR IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:26.086" end="00:01:31.525">WORLD, THEY USE GREAT TECHNOLOGY SO THE S&amp;P 500 IS GREAT, THE STOCK MARKET IS UP 85% RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.525" end="00:01:36.730">BUT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WORKER&apos;S FATE IS IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.730" end="00:01:38.332">THEY&apos;RE STUCK IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.332" end="00:01:39.867">THEY CAN&apos;T DO THIS GREAT ARBITRAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.867" end="00:01:41.468">THEIR WAGES HAVE BEEN FLAT FOR TEN YEARS AND...</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.468" end="00:01:44.771">&gt;&gt; Jon: CAPITAL IS MOBILE BUT PEOPLE...</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.771" end="00:01:45.239">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.239" end="00:01:52.646">AND SO FOR THEM WHAT YOU HAVE IS THESE TWIN FORCES OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH MEANS MACHINE CANS DO </p>
<p begin="00:01:52.646" end="00:01:53.747">THINGS PEOPLE USED TO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.747" end="00:01:58.118">THERE&apos;S NOW COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT CAN DO STUFF LAWYERS USED TO BE ABLE TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.118" end="00:01:59.419">DISCOVERY AND THINGS LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.419" end="00:02:01.288">MAY NOT BE SUCH A BAD THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.288" end="00:02:05.492">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT CAN LAWYERS DO THAT COMPUTERS CAN&apos;T DO?</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.492" end="00:02:05.893">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.893" end="00:02:08.462">&gt;&gt; WELL, IF YOU WANTED TO TRY AND SUE SOMEBODY ABOUT THAT...</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.462" end="00:02:10.230">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, I WOULD NOT!</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.230" end="00:02:13.367">HOW DO YOU SUE SOMEBODY OVER YOUR... WHO COULD I SNY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.367" end="00:02:14.701">&gt;&gt; JON STEWART?</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.701" end="00:02:15.469">&gt;&gt; Jon: MY ARM?</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.469" end="00:02:17.538">I WOULD SUE MY OWN ARM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.538" end="00:02:18.839">WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.839" end="00:02:19.239">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.239" end="00:02:22.142">&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE WAS A DEFECTIVE MANUFACTURER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.142" end="00:02:24.912">&gt;&gt; Jon: THERE WAS SOMETHING DEFECTIVE IN THERE, ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.912" end="00:02:25.312">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.312" end="00:02:26.547">&gt;&gt; BUT THE OTHER PART OF IT IS,</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.547" end="00:02:29.149">OF COURSE, THE FACT THAT YOU CAN MAKE STUFF ALL OVER THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.149" end="00:02:32.085">SO YOU TAKE TECHNOLOGY, YOU TAKE GLOBALIZATION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.085" end="00:02:36.890">FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER, THIS IS REALLY INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE </p>
<p begin="00:02:36.890" end="00:02:41.795">AMERICAN LABOR IS RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE NINE MILLION... SEVEN MILLION OFFICIALLY UNEMPLOYED </p>
<p begin="00:02:41.795" end="00:02:44.631">BUT YOU ADD UP ALL THE PEOPLE WHO STOPPED LOOKING FOR WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.631" end="00:02:49.903">YOU ADD UP THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PART-TIME JOBS AND THESE PART-TIME JOBS PAY HALF AS MUCH </p>
<p begin="00:02:49.903" end="00:02:51.471">AS THE MEDIAN WAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.471" end="00:02:56.910">THAT&apos;S 24 MILLION PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO ARE UNDER EMPLOYED OR UNEMPLOYED AND THOSE NUMBERS </p>
<p begin="00:02:56.910" end="00:02:58.111">AREN&apos;T GETTING BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.111" end="00:03:01.949">IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT&apos;S BUDGET IT ASSUMES WE WILL CREATE 20 MILLION JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.949" end="00:03:06.653">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THEM, IT&apos;S BEEN A YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.653" end="00:03:09.489">AND WE&apos;VE HEARD ABOUT JOBS THIS AND JOBS THAT AND WE&apos;VE GOT TO </p>
<p begin="00:03:09.489" end="00:03:10.824">DO SOMETHING ANT THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.824" end="00:03:14.595">I CANNOT POINT TO ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY HAS DONE TO ALLEVIATE THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.595" end="00:03:19.166">AND THE ONLY THING I&apos;M HEARING RIGHT NOW IS A REPUBLICAN PLAN THAT WE NEED TO CUT, WE NEED TO </p>
<p begin="00:03:19.166" end="00:03:20.734">MAKE IT BETTER FOR CORPORATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.734" end="00:03:27.140">BUT IT FEELS TO ME A FOOL&apos;S ERRAND TO CHASE THE IDEA THAT WE CAN CREATE CONDITIONS AS </p>
<p begin="00:03:27.140" end="00:03:30.310">CONDUCIVE FOR CORPORATIONS AS IT IS IN INDIA AND CHINA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.310" end="00:03:35.082">AMERICANS WILL NOT AND SHOULD NOT LIVE LIKE THOSE WORKERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.082" end="00:03:39.086">WE&apos;VE EARNED OUR MIDDLE-CLASS STATUS AND I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT...</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.086" end="00:03:44.658">HOW IS IT THAT IF YOU MAKE OUR COUNTRY MORE CONDUCIVE TO CORPORATIONS YOU WILL BRING THOSE BACK?</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.658" end="00:03:46.126">WE JUST CAN&apos;T COMPETE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.126" end="00:03:48.095">&gt;&gt; WELL, CERTAINLY NOT IN THE SHORT TERM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.095" end="00:03:52.599">IF YOU CUT BUDGETS IN THE SHORT TERM YOU&apos;RE LAYING OFF SCHOOL TEACHERS, YOU&apos;RE LAYING OFF </p>
<p begin="00:03:52.599" end="00:03:54.434">FIREFIGHTERS, YOU&apos;RE LAYING OFF POLICEMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.434" end="00:03:58.138">AND WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK OF THE LONG-TERM TRAJECTORY OF THAT, THAT MAYBE GOVERNMENT </p>
<p begin="00:03:58.138" end="00:04:01.542">BECOMES LEANER AND MEANER, IN THE SHORT RUN THAT&apos;S MORE PEOPLE </p>
<p begin="00:04:01.542" end="00:04:05.712">UNEMPLOYED, FEWER PEOPLE WHO CAN BUY STUFF, FEWER PEOPLE GOING TO DINERS, FEWER PEOPLE </p>
<p begin="00:04:05.712" end="00:04:06.813">CONTRIBUTING TO THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.813" end="00:04:11.919">I THINK OUR MEASURE SHOULD BE-- AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS I TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK-- THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:11.919" end="00:04:13.887">MEASURE SHOULD BE A COUNTRY LIKE GERMANY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.887" end="00:04:16.490">GERMANY HAS MANAGED TO MAINTAIN ITS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY EVEN </p>
<p begin="00:04:16.490" end="00:04:23.330">THOUGH IT IS ONE OF THE... IT&apos;S GOT PRETTY HIGH TAXES, A LOT OF REGULATIONS, UNIONS AND WHY?</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.330" end="00:04:28.669">BECAUSE THEY VIEW GOVERNMENT IN A POSITIVE WAY, WHICH IS GOVERNMENT INVESTS IN </p>
<p begin="00:04:28.669" end="00:04:33.307">TECHNOLOGY, IN SCIENCE, IN TECHNICAL INSTITUTES, IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.307" end="00:04:37.110">IT TRIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS THAT YOU CAN DO POSITIVELY TO GROW THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.110" end="00:04:40.781">OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE PRIVATE SECTOR ECONOMY AND YOU&apos;VE GOT TO LOOK </p>
<p begin="00:04:40.781" end="00:04:43.750">AT REGULATIONS AND YOU&apos;VE GOT TO LOOK AT ALL THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.750" end="00:04:48.422">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THAT&apos;S SUGGESTING WE HAVE NO COHERENT DOMESTIC </p>
<p begin="00:04:48.422" end="00:04:50.691">MANUFACTURING OR LABOR POLICY IN THIS COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.691" end="00:04:52.759">AND IS THAT... WE DON&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.759" end="00:04:56.763">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHS) </p>
<p begin="00:04:56.763" end="00:04:59.733">&gt;&gt; TO BE FAIR, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.733" end="00:05:04.137">THEY&apos;RE TRYING TO DOUBLE EXPORTS, BUT IT&apos;S VERY DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT GOVERNMENT </p>
<p begin="00:05:04.137" end="00:05:05.873">CAN DO POSITIVELY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.873" end="00:05:08.408">THERE&apos;S ALL KINDS OF STUFF THAT WE KNOW THAT GOVERNMENT SCREWS </p>
<p begin="00:05:08.408" end="00:05:11.678">UP AND DOESN&apos;T DO RIGHT AND THAT&apos;S FINE AND WE SHOULD... YOU </p>
<p begin="00:05:11.678" end="00:05:16.350">KNOW, WE SHOULD TRY AND MAKE IT A MORE REGULATORY FRIENDLY AND TAX FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.350" end="00:05:22.489">BUT THERE&apos;S ALSO STUFF THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT MADE SILICON VALLEY, SILICON VALLEY </p>
<p begin="00:05:22.489" end="00:05:24.758">WAS MADE BY A GREAT STATE EDUCATION SYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.758" end="00:05:29.463">THESE AMAZING,CAL CAMPUSES, A GREAT EDUCATION SYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.463" end="00:05:32.733">IT WAS MADE BY DEPARTMENT DEMAND FOR ENGINEERS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.733" end="00:05:35.569">LOCKHEED, ALL THESE COMPANIES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.569" end="00:05:39.072">THE U.S. GOVERNMENT USED TO BUY EVERY COMPUTER CHIP THAT WAS MANUFACTURED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.072" end="00:05:41.708">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU&apos;RE SAYING THE KEY IS EDUCATION AND WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.708" end="00:05:43.243">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:43.243" end="00:05:44.678">&gt;&gt; WELL, WAR HAS...</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.678" end="00:05:52.286">&gt;&gt; Jon: IF WE CAN JUST KEEP STARTING WORLD WARS AND DOUBLING BACK DOWN ON G.I. BILLS WE CAN </p>
<p begin="00:05:52.286" end="00:05:54.288">HAVE THIS THING WORKED OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.288" end="00:05:56.290">&gt;&gt; WORLD WARS ARE REALLY USEFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.290" end="00:05:57.824">SMALL WARS DON&apos;T HELP AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.824" end="00:05:59.092">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHS).</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.092" end="00:05:59.459">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.459" end="00:06:01.662">&gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DESTROY THE OTHER COMPETITORS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.662" end="00:06:03.564">THAT WAS THE GREAT THING ABOUT WORLD WAR II.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.564" end="00:06:07.568">YOU FLATTEN THE OTHER COMPETITORS, YOU&apos;RE LEFT ON TOP...</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.568" end="00:06:10.637">(AUDIENCE REACTS) THIS IS THE STEWART/ZAKARIA PLAN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.637" end="00:06:14.641">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DON&apos;T KNOW WHY NO ONE&apos;S RUNNING ON THAT PLATFORM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.641" end="00:06:15.509">(LAUGHTER) AMERICA!</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.509" end="00:06:17.477">WE&apos;LL FLATTEN YOU.</p>

<p begin="00:06:17.878" end="00:06:19.847">&gt;&gt; AND THEN WE&apos;LL SELL TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.847" end="00:06:22.516">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEN WE&apos;LL SELL YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO REBUILD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.516" end="00:06:23.851">A PERFECT SYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.851" end="00:06:25.719">ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.</p>
