<p begin="00:00:22.990" end="00:00:23.824">(APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:00:23.824" end="00:00:25.259">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO LET ME ASK YOU,</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.259" end="00:00:27.761">LAST TIME I TALKED TO YOU WERE JUST LEAVING THE ADMINISTRATION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.761" end="00:00:31.732">YOU WERE ELATED, WALK ON CLOUD NINE, YOU HAVE BEEN GONE NOW FOR HOW LONG.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.732" end="00:00:33.767">&gt;&gt; A LITTLE OVER A YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.767" end="00:00:35.802">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE FOLLOWED IT SINCE THEN?</p>

<p begin="00:00:44.645" end="00:00:46.680">TO SAY A BOOT CAMP, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.680" end="00:00:48.782">HE HATED IT AT THE TIME HE HATED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.782" end="00:00:54.254">AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN LIFE THAT IT TAKES YOU, YOU KNOW, A YEAR, MANY YEARS,</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.254" end="00:00:58.392">EVEN A DECADE BEFORE YOU GO LOOK BACK AND REALIZE HOW AWFUL IT REALLY WAS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.392" end="00:01:00.761">AND THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S GOT A LITTLE OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.761" end="00:01:02.829">A LITTLE OF THAT FEATURE TO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.829" end="00:01:06.300">&gt;&gt; Jon: I FIND THAT TYPICALLY THAT&apos;S WHAT PEOPLE SAY TO SOMEONE WHEN THEY&apos;RE </p>
<p begin="00:01:06.300" end="00:01:12.072">TRYING TO MAKE THAT PERSON FEEL BETTER ABOUT WHAT THEY&apos;VE SPENT THEIR LIFE DOING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.072" end="00:01:15.475">YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, LIKE IT&apos;S ALWAYS THE DRILL SERGEANT, YOU GO BACK AND </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.475" end="00:01:19.146">SAY HEY, MAN, I NEVER APPRECIATED WHAT AN [BLEEP]</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.646" end="00:01:22.282">BUT NOW THAT I HAVE MY OWN KIDS I&apos;M LIKE, YOU&apos;RE GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.282" end="00:01:23.984">YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.984" end="00:01:25.085">IT&apos;S ALWAYS THAT KIND OF,</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.085" end="00:01:27.287">IT&apos;S THAT AMBIVALENCE THAT YOU HAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.287" end="00:01:29.523">&gt;&gt; YEAH, NO, BUT I&apos;M SAYING,</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.523" end="00:01:33.594">YOU LOOK BACK IT STILL SEEMS LIKE IT WAS JUST AS BAD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.594" end="00:01:34.595">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:34.595" end="00:01:36.597">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE NOT TURNED THE CORNER YET.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.597" end="00:01:39.833">&gt;&gt; YEAH, REALLY, YOU HAVEN&apos;T TURNED THE CORNER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.833" end="00:01:42.769">AND THAT&apos;S OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.769" end="00:01:46.240">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT YOU ARE BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, YOU -- </p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:47.875">&gt;&gt; I AGREE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.875" end="00:01:52.646">LOOK, I HAVE LARRY DAVID HERE I WOULD TELL HIM WE&apos;RE A LOT BETTER OFF THAN WE </p>
<p begin="00:01:52.646" end="00:01:53.714">WERE FOUR YEARS AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.714" end="00:01:55.415">I MEAN I THINK-- .</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.415" end="00:01:57.818">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU WANT ME TO BRING LARRY OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.818" end="00:01:58.151">TELL ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.151" end="00:01:59.920">WHAT WAS IT THAT WAS SO DIFFICULT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.920" end="00:02:04.291">THE FIRST DAY WHEN DEMOCRATS GOT THAT QUESTION AFTER THE REPUBLICAN, ARE WE BETTER OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.291" end="00:02:07.361">THEY SUDDENLY WERE ALL JACKIE MASON, WHAT IS BETTER,</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.361" end="00:02:09.129">BET CERTIFICATE HERE, I DON&apos;T KNOW -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:09.129" end="00:02:12.866">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M NOT-- I HAVE A Ph.D IN ECONOMICS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.866" end="00:02:14.568">I&apos;M NOT LIKE THE MESSAGE GUY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.568" end="00:02:15.969">WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME FOR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.969" end="00:02:22.109">BUT THE MOMENT, I WAS THERE IN THE MOMENT WHEN WE COME IN, AND THAT WAS A HORRIBLE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.109" end="00:02:27.681">THAT WAS ABOUT THE WORST FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS IN THE ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.681" end="00:02:29.917">THE STOCK MARKETS COLLAPSING,</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.917" end="00:02:32.252">NET WORTH OF PEOPLE DOWN 40,</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.252" end="00:02:34.688">50%, IN A COUPLE MONTH PERIOD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.688" end="00:02:39.126">I&apos;M GETTING CALLS FROM PEOPLE IN THE ECONOMICS PROFESSION SAYING WHAT IS </p>
<p begin="00:02:39.126" end="00:02:41.828">THIS IS HOW THE DEPRESSION BEGAN AM COME UP WITH PLAN B.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.828" end="00:02:44.898">ONCE THE DEPRESSION STARTS THEN WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.898" end="00:02:48.302">THE THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY WOULD SAY OH, YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO SWITCH PLACES FROM </p>
<p begin="00:02:48.302" end="00:02:52.372">NOW TO GO BACK THEN WHEN WE&apos;RE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH IS LIKE A JOKE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.372" end="00:02:53.540">WERE THEY ASLEEP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.540" end="00:02:55.108">THERE THEY WERE ON VACATION,.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.108" end="00:02:55.776">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT IS LUDICROUS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.776" end="00:02:57.878">BUT WERE THEY ASLEEP IS MY QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.878" end="00:02:58.912">&gt;&gt; THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.912" end="00:03:00.747">&gt;&gt; Jon: BECAUSE I WATCHED THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.747" end="00:03:05.052">AND I WAS ASTONISHED, YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FORMED </p>
<p begin="00:03:05.052" end="00:03:07.054">THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.054" end="00:03:11.725">THAT THEY STRUNG UP-- SPRUNG UP OUT OF A WELL SPRING,</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.725" end="00:03:17.364">THEY ARE YOU PRODUCED BY FORCE AND THAT THERE WAS NO MEMORY OF ANY REPUBLICAN </p>
<p begin="00:03:17.364" end="00:03:20.501">INITIATIVES THAT HAD EVER BEEN DONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.501" end="00:03:22.135">IT WAS ALL LIKE, FOLKS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.135" end="00:03:25.539">THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO WE WOKE UP AND DECIDED TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.539" end="00:03:28.342">AND YOU&apos;RE LIKE, THEY HAD THE DEBT CLOCK OUT ON THE STAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.342" end="00:03:29.676">AND YOU JUST WANTED TO SAY,</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.676" end="00:03:31.678">LIKE, HALF OF THAT IS YOURS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.678" end="00:03:32.779">RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.779" end="00:03:34.081">AND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.081" end="00:03:39.186">&gt;&gt; I MEAN, TO RECONCILE THAT WITH A PLATFORM WHERE THEY&apos;RE SAYING, AND SO LET&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:03:39.186" end="00:03:42.189">GO CUT TAXES BY $5 TRILLION,</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.189" end="00:03:44.224">GEAR IT TO THE HIGH END,</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.224" end="00:03:45.926">LET&apos;S GO-- .</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.926" end="00:03:46.894">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY DIDN&apos;T MENTION -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:46.894" end="00:03:49.363">&gt;&gt; AS AN ECONOMIST, WATCHING THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.363" end="00:03:50.097">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.097" end="00:03:57.371">&gt;&gt; Jon: WERE YOU SHOCKED TO SEE THREE DAYS, YOU KNOW, 72 HOUR, WHATEVER IT IS, GO BY </p>
<p begin="00:03:57.371" end="00:04:01.175">WITH NO ONE MENTIONING ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.175" end="00:04:04.311">&gt;&gt; I WASN&apos;T SHOCKED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.311" end="00:04:11.118">I NOTED THAT, YOU KNOW, I DIDN&apos;T-- IT WASN&apos;T OVERLY POLICY FOCUSED, YOU KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.118" end="00:04:15.923">IT WAS-- SO THE THING IS,</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.923" end="00:04:16.890">THAT WAS-- .</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:18.325">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT WAS VERY POLITE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.325" end="00:04:21.061">&gt;&gt; THEY GOT THEIR PROGRAM UP ON THE WEB.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.061" end="00:04:22.396">YOU CAN GO LOOK AT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.396" end="00:04:24.431">AND I MEAN, FAR IT BE FROM ME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.431" end="00:04:26.500">I ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO GO READ IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.500" end="00:04:28.936">THEY KEEP SAYING IT&apos;S A SPECIFIC PLAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.936" end="00:04:29.903">IT&apos;S NOT SPECIFIC AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.903" end="00:04:33.307">THE SPECIFICS ARE LIKE MAKE AMERICA BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.307" end="00:04:36.076">&gt;&gt; Jon: HONESTLY IT READS LIKE A LETTER TO SANTA CLAUS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.076" end="00:04:38.111">LIKE-- IT&apos;S A WISH LIST.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.111" end="00:04:39.847">YOU GOT A COUPLE MINUTES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.847" end="00:04:44.618">WE&apos;RE GOING HAVE MORE WITH AUSTAN GOOLSBEE WHEN WE GET BACK UP ON THE WEB.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.618" end="00:04:45.152">WE&apos;LL GET THAT.</p>
