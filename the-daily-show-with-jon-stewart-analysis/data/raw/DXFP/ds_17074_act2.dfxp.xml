<p begin="00:00:05.038" end="00:00:05.806">THANK YOU FOR REJOINING US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.806" end="00:00:10.477">YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY THING HAPPENING IN AMERICA AT THIS MOMENT ARE THE PRIMARIES,</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.477" end="00:00:12.312">BUT, OF COURSE, THAT&apos;S COMPLETELY NOT TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.312" end="00:00:18.652">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S SOMETHING HAPPENING AT THIS BIG MUSIC FESTIVAL THEY HAVE IN TEXAS, SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.652" end="00:00:20.153">IT&apos;S GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE UPSET.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.153" end="00:00:22.956">&gt;&gt; Jon: TROUBLE AT A MUSIC FESTIVAL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.956" end="00:00:23.957">WHAT COULD IT BE?</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.957" end="00:00:28.161">WAS THE CROWD ASKED IF THEY WERE READY TO ROCK AND THEY SAID, IN A MINUTE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.161" end="00:00:31.832">DID IT TURN OUT VAMPIRE WEEKEND IS ACTUAL VAMPIRES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.832" end="00:00:35.035">DID SOMEONE SNEAK IN A BOTTLE OF WATER FROM THE OUTSIDE?</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.035" end="00:00:36.436">THAT WILL BE $6, HIPPIE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.436" end="00:00:40.140">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S A CONTROVERSY BREWING OVER A ADVERTISING AGENCY&apos;S USE </p>
<p begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:44.111">OF 13 HOMELESS PEOPLE AS HUMAN WIFI HOT SPOTS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.111" end="00:00:49.483">&gt;&gt; BASICALLY THEY HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE TECHIES BETTER WIFI ACCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.483" end="00:01:02.329">THEY HAVE ATTACHED WIFI ROUTERS TO HOMELESS PEOPLE, MAKING THEM IN EFFECT INDIVIDUAL WIFI HOT SPOTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.329" end="00:01:04.932">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.932" end="00:01:11.438">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO RATHER THAN TRAIN HOMELESS PEOPLE TO BECOME COMPUTER WORKERS, WE&apos;RE TRAINING </p>
<p begin="00:01:11.438" end="00:01:17.311">THEM TO BECOME COMPUTER EQUIPMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.311" end="00:01:18.879">WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR NEW JOB,</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.879" end="00:01:19.213">BILLY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.213" end="00:01:22.850">&gt;&gt; I GOT REPLACED BY A POLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.850" end="00:01:26.787">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS WALKING AROUND WITH A 4G TRANSMITTER EVEN HEALTHY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.787" end="00:01:30.224">&gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS IS EXPLOITING THE HOMELESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.224" end="00:01:32.292">IT&apos;S NOT EVEN MINIMUM WAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.292" end="00:01:36.263">THERE ARE OTHERS WHO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF RADIATION EXPOSURE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.263" end="00:01:40.167">SINCE I&apos;M IN THE A SCIENTIST I CAN&apos;T DELVE INTO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.167" end="00:01:40.934">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.934" end="00:01:42.669">YOU&apos;RE NOT A SCIENTIST, BUT YOU HAVE A PHONE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.669" end="00:01:45.105">YOU CAN CALL A SCIENTIST OR CHECK THE INTERNET.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.105" end="00:01:47.207">YOU CAN GET ONLINE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.207" end="00:01:50.277">TRY WAVING YOUR LAPTOP AROUND A HOMELESS PERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.277" end="00:01:50.644">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.644" end="00:01:53.347">APPARENTLY THAT WORKS NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.347" end="00:01:56.550">JUST LOOK AT THE SHIRT THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO WEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.550" end="00:02:04.057">&quot;I&apos;M MARK, A 4G HOT SPOT.&quot; NOT, I&apos;M MARK, A PERSON WITH A 4G HOT SPOT.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:02:04.057" end="00:02:13.267">NOT &quot;ASK ME HOW I, A HUMAN NAMED MARK, CAN HELP YOU,&quot; NONE OF THOSE THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.267" end="00:02:15.435">I AM A 4G HOT SPOT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.435" end="00:02:17.437">FOR A SUGGESTED FEE OF $2,</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.437" end="00:02:22.276">THEY&apos;LL GIVE YOU THE PASS WORD TO THE 4G NETWORK HANGING AROUND THEIR NECKS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.276" end="00:02:24.745">I WONDER WHAT THE PASSWORDS COULD BE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.745" end="00:02:26.246">HOW ABOUT, I DON&apos;T KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.246" end="00:02:27.214">[BLEEPED] YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.214" end="00:02:32.586">OR MAYBE WHY DON&apos;T YOU SHOVE THAT iPAD UP YOUR ASS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.586" end="00:02:39.193">OR MAYBE, THE $2 YOU JUST GAVE ME FAILS TO PAY FOR THE SYSTEMATIC FAILURE OF NATION&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:02:39.193" end="00:02:41.461">WELFARE AND PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH POLICY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.461" end="00:02:44.264">THAT&apos;S A SECURE PASSWORD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.264" end="00:02:47.167">[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.167" end="00:02:47.467">OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.467" end="00:02:50.237">THAT WINDED ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.237" end="00:02:51.371">SO I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.371" end="00:02:55.409">THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA THAT NO ONE IS OKAY WITH, RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.409" end="00:03:01.582">&gt;&gt; BEFORE WE STAND UP FOR THE OPPRESSED POOR, IF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU FOUND OUT A SANDWICH </p>
<p begin="00:03:01.582" end="00:03:06.687">SHOP HIRED A HOMELESS PERSON TO BE A BILLBOARD, WALK THE STREETS, EAT AT JOES AND PAY HIM </p>
<p begin="00:03:06.687" end="00:03:09.423">$20 AN HOUR, YOU WOULD APPLAUD THE SANDWICH SHOP AND SAY, WOW,</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.423" end="00:03:13.193">THIS HOMELESS PERSON IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.193" end="00:03:15.562">YOU&apos;RE GETTING $20 AND YOU FEEL USEFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.562" end="00:03:16.964">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE MISSING A POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.964" end="00:03:18.432">WHAT YOU SAID IS NOT GOING ON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.432" end="00:03:19.933">IT&apos;S NOT $20 AN HOUR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.933" end="00:03:21.401">IT&apos;S $20.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.401" end="00:03:25.472">SECOND, THEY&apos;RE WEARING A T-SHIRT THAT SAYS, &quot;I AM A HOT </p>
<p begin="00:03:25.472" end="00:03:28.542">SPOT&quot; WHEREAS IF YOU&apos;RE READING A SANDWICH BOARD, IT DOES NOT </p>
<p begin="00:03:28.542" end="00:03:30.744">READ, &quot;I AM A SANDWICH BOARD.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:30.744" end="00:03:31.111">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.111" end="00:03:33.680">AND IF THIS IS SO GOOD, WHY STOP AT WIFI HOT SPOTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:38.485">AS LONG AS WE&apos;RE USING VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AS OBJECTS, LET&apos;S MAKE THE ONLINE </p>
<p begin="00:03:38.485" end="00:03:41.588">EXPERIENCE COMPLETE, MAYBE A MOBILE HOMELESS CAFE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.588" end="00:03:46.793">CHAIRS, TABLES, AIR CONDITIONING, EVEN A RESTROOM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.793" end="00:03:51.765">AND IF YOU&apos;RE LUCKY, ONE OF THEM WILL SING TO YOU WITH THEIR SURPRISINGLY BEAUTIFUL VOICE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.765" end="00:03:52.699">WE&apos;LL BE RIGHT BACK.</p>
