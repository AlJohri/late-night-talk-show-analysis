<p begin="00:00:39.239" end="00:00:44.344">LET&apos;S TALK VERY QUICKLY ABOUT THE DUST-UP THAT HAPPENED TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.344" end="00:00:49.216">YOU WERE INVITED TO A POETRY READING AT THE WHITE HOUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.216" end="00:00:50.450">IS THAT CORRECT?</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.952" end="00:00:53.453">&gt;&gt; AND YOU ACCEPTED IT?</p>

<p begin="00:01:07.067" end="00:01:15.709">TO SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS THE REINCARNATION OF CHE GUEVARA HAD BEEN INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.709" end="00:01:21.148">WHAT DID I FEEL LIKE TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT FIRESTORM, TO ACCEPT AN INVITATION TO A WHITE </p>
<p begin="00:01:21.148" end="00:01:23.750">HOUSE YOU HAD ALREADY BEEN TO A COUPLE OF TIMES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.750" end="00:01:26.486">WHAT DID THE FIRESTORM FEEL LIKE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.486" end="00:01:29.556">&gt;&gt; WELL, AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS HUMOROUS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.556" end="00:01:33.360">I&apos;M LIKE, REALLY, THEY THINK THAT I&apos;M THE PERSON THAT&apos;S A </p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:36.096">NEGATIVE, A NEGATIVE RAP ARTIST,</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.096" end="00:01:38.899">AND THEN I REALIZED THAT THEY JUST DIDN&apos;T KNOW ME BECAUSE IF </p>
<p begin="00:01:38.899" end="00:01:44.705">THEY HAD, THEY WOULDN&apos;T COME OUT AND SAY THAT I RAP ABOUT KILLING COPS, AND, YOU KNOW, ANYBODY </p>
<p begin="00:01:44.705" end="00:01:47.441">THAT KNOWS ME KNOWS I PUT OUT MUSIC ABOUT LOVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.441" end="00:01:52.145">I PUT OUT MUSIC ABOUT SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS, COMMUNITY, GOD,</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.145" end="00:01:52.880">HAVING FUN.</p>

<p begin="00:01:57.584" end="00:01:58.585">THAT&apos;S UNUSUAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.585" end="00:02:00.220">THAT COULD SCARE WHITE PEOPLE.</p>

<p begin="00:02:02.923" end="00:02:06.493">&gt;&gt; Jon: A LOT OF WHITE PEOPLE WEAR SOMETIMES THINNER COLLARS ON THEIR SWEATERS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.493" end="00:02:08.862">AND THEN YOU COME IN...</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.862" end="00:02:11.765">&gt;&gt; DOES MY TIE HELP THE WHOLE OUTFIT?</p>

<p begin="00:02:17.504" end="00:02:21.341">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN... YOU KNOW, ALMOST A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.341" end="00:02:26.213">HOW DID YOU... DID ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU KNOW, YOUR E-MAIL GO OFF WHEN THIS WAS OCCURRING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.213" end="00:02:27.714">&gt;&gt; WELL, IT WAS STRANGE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.714" end="00:02:33.987">I WAS WORKING ON A PROJECT CALLED &quot;HELL ON WHEELS,&quot; AND WHILE WE WERE FILMING, I WAS </p>
<p begin="00:02:33.987" end="00:02:39.893">GETTING TEXTS, AND WHEN I CAME BACK I SEEN ONE OF MY FRIENDS TEXTED ME AND SAID, DON&apos;T LET IT </p>
<p begin="00:02:39.893" end="00:02:40.527">GET TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.527" end="00:02:42.729">I WAS WONDERING WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.729" end="00:02:45.933">I&apos;M LIKE, WHAT, DID SOME GIRL SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ME?</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.933" end="00:02:50.771">SO THEN I STARTED GETTING MORE TEXTS SAYING, THAT THEN I REALIZED SOME OF MY TEAM MEMBERS </p>
<p begin="00:02:50.771" end="00:02:56.543">TOLD ME, YOU KNOW, THEY&apos;RE SAYING FOX NEWS AND SARAH PALIN SAID THIS AND THAT ABOUT YOU,</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.543" end="00:02:58.412">THAT YOU ARE THIS TYPE OF ARTIST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.412" end="00:02:59.913">THAT&apos;S WHEN I WAS LIKE REALLY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.913" end="00:03:01.248">YOU SURE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.248" end="00:03:04.818">SARAH PALIN MUST HAVE NEVER HEARD ANY OF COMMON&apos;S MUSIC.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.818" end="00:03:05.552">SHE&apos;S NEVER BEEN...</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.552" end="00:03:06.854">&gt;&gt; </p>
<p begin="00:03:06.854" end="00:03:09.556">&gt;&gt; Jon: I THINK WHEN SHE&apos;S ON THE BUS TOURING THE GREAT STATES </p>
<p begin="00:03:09.556" end="00:03:11.191">OF AMERICA, SHE MAY GET DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.191" end="00:03:12.292">WE DON&apos;T KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.292" end="00:03:14.728">BUT YOU COME OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.728" end="00:03:16.930">NOW, THIS BOOK IS YOUR MEMOIR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.930" end="00:03:18.065">IT&apos;S BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.065" end="00:03:20.834">YOU REALLY ARE A WONDERFUL WRITER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.834" end="00:03:24.338">AND YOU ARE ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH... AS I WAS READING IT, I </p>
<p begin="00:03:24.338" end="00:03:27.074">WAS THINKING, BOY, I DON&apos;T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MYSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.074" end="00:03:37.417">YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE VERY OPEN ABOUT THINGS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SPEED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.417" end="00:03:39.386">WAS IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO THAT POINT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.386" end="00:03:42.189">&gt;&gt; NO, I THINK IT STARTED WITH JUST BEING RAISED BY MY MOTHER,</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.189" end="00:03:43.657">WHO TAUGHT ME TO LOVE MYSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.657" end="00:03:49.997">AND SHE LOVED ME SO STRONG THAT I FELT CONFIDENT IN MYSELF ENOUGH TO BE AROUND WHOEVER I </p>
<p begin="00:03:49.997" end="00:03:52.199">AM, WHOEVER I&apos;M AROUND, I CAN BE MYSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.199" end="00:03:52.833">&gt;&gt; Jon: UH-HUH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.833" end="00:03:56.703">&gt;&gt; AND I&apos;M NOT AFRAID TO BE OPEN BECAUSE WE&apos;RE ALL HUMAN BEING,</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.703" end="00:03:57.104">MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.104" end="00:04:00.307">WE ALL HAVE GREAT THINGS ABOUT US, AND WE ALL HAVE FLAWS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.307" end="00:04:01.942">WE JUST ARE WORKS IN PROGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.942" end="00:04:06.880">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY DID YOU SAY WHEN YOU SAID &quot;FLAW,&quot; YOU LOOKED DIRECTLY AT ME, BECAUSE I </p>
<p begin="00:04:06.880" end="00:04:09.483">THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.483" end="00:04:10.851">&quot;FLAWS,&quot; AND THEN YOU LOOKED UP,</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.851" end="00:04:12.352">I SEE &apos;EM, RIGHT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.352" end="00:04:15.556">YOUR MOTHER ACTUALLY, AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS INTERESTING,</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.556" end="00:04:20.060">WRITES, YOU KNOW, ALMOST ANNOTATES THE BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.060" end="00:04:23.397">SHE WRITES ABOUT SOME OF THE STORIES THAT YOU&apos;RE WRITING ABOUT, GIVING ANOTHER </p>
<p begin="00:04:23.397" end="00:04:25.499">PERSPECTIVE ON IT, WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.499" end="00:04:30.304">&gt;&gt; YEAH, I MEAN, THAT VOICE IN THE BOOK OF MY MOTHER IS REALLY THE VOICE THAT SHE IS IN MY LIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.304" end="00:04:36.376">YOU KNOW, AS I WALK THROUGH LIFE AND MAKE SOME GOOD CHOICES, I CAN HEAR HER SAYING, YES, GOOD CHOICE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.376" end="00:04:41.615">AND THEN SOMETIMES I MAKE SOME BAD ONES, AND SHE&apos;S LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SON, COME ON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.615" end="00:04:46.854">TO HAVE HER PERSPECTIVE ACTUALLY WAS INSIGHTFUL FOR ME, TOO,</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.854" end="00:04:52.192">BECAUSE SOME OF THAT WISDOM THAT I STILL... YOU STILL NEED TO KNOW AND YOU STILL NEED TO LIKE </p>
<p begin="00:04:52.192" end="00:04:57.831">REMEMBER, AND IT ALSO REMINDS YOU OF WHERE YOU COME FROM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.831" end="00:05:04.304">&gt;&gt; THERE WERE CERTAIN POINTS IN THE BOOK, AND THEN IT GETS TO YOUR DISCOVERY OF WHAT I GUESS </p>
<p begin="00:05:04.304" end="00:05:05.906">I&apos;LL CALL &quot;THE LADIES.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:05.906" end="00:05:08.342">&gt;&gt; THE LADIES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.342" end="00:05:10.477">THE LADIES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.477" end="00:05:10.844">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.844" end="00:05:13.914">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT IS A CHANT THAT&apos;S OFTEN USED, THE LADIES, AND IT </p>
<p begin="00:05:13.914" end="00:05:16.483">IS RELATIVELY OPEN AND GRAPHIC,</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.483" end="00:05:20.354">AND I REMEMBER AS I WAS READING IT, I JUST KEPT THINKING,</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.354" end="00:05:25.058">COMMON, YOUR MOM IS ON THE PAGE RIGHT BEFORE THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.058" end="00:05:29.062">I THINK SHE CAN HEAR YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.062" end="00:05:34.835">DID SHE READ THE WHOLE BOOK FIRST AND THEN... DID YOU HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.835" end="00:05:39.673">WERE THERE THINGS WHERE SHE SAID, SO THAT&apos;S WHERE YOU WERE IN TENTH GRADE WHEN YOU SAID YOU </p>
<p begin="00:05:39.673" end="00:05:40.641">WERE WITH YOUR COUSIN IN </p>
<p begin="00:05:40.641" end="00:05:44.678">&gt;&gt; WHEN I WAS WRITING IT, I JUST HAD TO BE OPEN AND NOT THINK </p>
<p begin="00:05:44.678" end="00:05:52.085">ABOUT WHO WOULD SAY WHAT BECAUSE MY TRUTH IS MY TRUTH, AND I LIVE MY LIFE TO TRY TO DO IT THE BEST </p>
<p begin="00:05:52.085" end="00:05:52.519">I CAN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.519" end="00:05:54.855">I KNEW MY MOTHER WOULDN&apos;T JUDGE ME TOO MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.855" end="00:05:59.326">CERTAIN THINGS, YOU KNOW, YOU DON&apos;T WANT TO DO AROUND YOUR MOTHER, EVEN AS AN ADULT MAN, I </p>
<p begin="00:05:59.326" end="00:06:03.030">DON&apos;T GET TOO MUCH PDA WITH A WOMAN AROUND MY MOTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.030" end="00:06:04.531">I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DOING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.531" end="00:06:08.035">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T LIKE LISTENING TO THE RADIO IN FRONT OF MY MOTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.035" end="00:06:11.805">I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING&apos;S GOING TO HAPPEN IN A SONG AND I&apos;M GOING TO BE LIKE...</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.805" end="00:06:17.878">&gt;&gt; YES, I MEAN, BUT SHE READ IT AND SAID, WOW, I DIDN&apos;T KNOW </p>
<p begin="00:06:17.878" end="00:06:19.947">SOME OF THOSE THINGS HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.947" end="00:06:22.816">BUT OVERALL SHE WAS HAPPY I WAS ABLE TO BE HONEST.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.816" end="00:06:26.687">WHEN YOU WRITE SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YOU&apos;RE DOING IT SO PEOPLE CAN BE INSPIRED AND BE </p>
<p begin="00:06:26.687" end="00:06:29.289">MOTIVATED, AND BECAUSE WE ALL ARE JUST PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.289" end="00:06:33.660">SOMEBODY CAN SEE SOME OF MY STORIES AND BE LIKE, MAN, I WENT THROUGH THE SAME THING, AND I </p>
<p begin="00:06:33.660" end="00:06:35.062">CAN GO FULFILL MY DREAMS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.062" end="00:06:39.199">&gt;&gt; WELL, IT&apos;S A GREAT STORY AND REALLY AN INTERESTING AND </p>
