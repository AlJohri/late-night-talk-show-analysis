<p begin="00:00:03.070" end="00:00:04.605">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.605" end="00:00:07.241">OUR GUEST TODAY... OH, YOU&apos;RE VERY KIND.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.241" end="00:00:12.012">YESTERDAY THE REPUBLICANS FORMALLY ADAPTED THEIR TWELVE PARTY PLATFORM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.012" end="00:00:15.516">IT&apos;S BEEN HAILED AS THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PLATFORM IN MODERN </p>
<p begin="00:00:15.516" end="00:00:20.654">HISTORY IN THAT IT&apos;S TRYING TO UNDO A GOOD DEAL OF MODERN HISTORY, INCLUDING BANNING </p>
<p begin="00:00:20.654" end="00:00:25.192">SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, GAY MILITARY SERVICE, ANY AND ALL GUN RESTRICTIONS AND WOMEN IN COMBAT </p>
<p begin="00:00:25.192" end="00:00:31.131">BECAUSE THE BATTLEFIELD IS REALLY THE ONE PLACE WHERE WOMEN SHOULDN&apos;T HAVE GUNS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.131" end="00:00:32.633">UM...</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.633" end="00:00:33.467">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.467" end="00:00:37.771">BUT THE PLANK GETTING THE MOST ATTENTION IS THE ONE CALLING FOR A HUMAN LIFE AMENDMENT TO THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:37.771" end="00:00:42.876">CONSTITUTION WHICH WOULD IN ESSENCE BAN ABORTION EVEN IN THE CASE OF INCEST OR RAPE WHICH AS </p>
<p begin="00:00:42.876" end="00:00:47.915">WE RECENTLY LEARNED FROM TODD AKIN DOESN&apos;T EVEN RESULT IN PREGNANCY BECAUSE RAPED WOMEN&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:00:47.915" end="00:00:53.287">BODIES AUTOMATICALLY GO INTO A MAGICAL SPERM-KILLING LOCKDOWN WHICH, ALTHOUGH YOU&apos;RE SURPRISED </p>
<p begin="00:00:53.287" end="00:00:57.724">WHY THEY DIDN&apos;T ALSO DEVELOP SOME KIND OF ANTI-PENILE TECHNOLOGY REALLY I THINK IS </p>
<p begin="00:00:57.724" end="00:01:05.065">PROBABLY IN THE R&amp;D STAGE YOU WOULD THINK THAT AN INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED VAGINA </p>
<p begin="00:01:05.065" end="00:01:05.832">WOULD HAVE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.832" end="00:01:09.870">(LAUGHTER) BUT THE POINT IS THIS, MITT ROMNEY DISAGREES WITH THAT PLATFORM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.870" end="00:01:12.706">SO HOW WILL THE DELEGATES RATIFYING THE PLATFORM REACT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.706" end="00:01:14.842">OUR OWN SAMANTHA BEE FOUND OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.842" end="00:01:18.846">&gt;&gt; THE G.O.P. PLATFORM IS CLEAR: NO ABORTION, NO EXCEPTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.846" end="00:01:22.249">BUT THE G.O.P. CANDIDATE DISAGREES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.249" end="00:01:25.619">&gt;&gt; THERE SHOULD BE EXCEPTIONS IN THE CASE OF RAPE AND INSIST AND </p>
<p begin="00:01:25.619" end="00:01:28.188">WHEN THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER IS AT STAKE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.188" end="00:01:32.226">&gt;&gt; BUT HOW WOULD THE DELEGATES WHO RATIFY THIS PLATFORM RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.226" end="00:01:37.598">&gt;&gt; I DO BELIEVE THE PLATFORM IS CORRECT THAT LIFE BEGINS WITH CONCEPTION BUT W NO EXCEPTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.598" end="00:01:39.633">&gt;&gt; BUT MITT ROMNEY WOULD ALLOW FOR EXCEPTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.633" end="00:01:40.200">&gt;&gt; CORRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:41.735">&gt;&gt; SO THAT&apos;S OKAY FOR YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.735" end="00:01:44.104">&gt;&gt; IF THAT&apos;S THE CHOICE HE MAKES, THAT&apos;S HIS CHOICE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.104" end="00:01:47.407">&gt;&gt; HE IS AAY HOW WILLED TO CHOOSE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.407" end="00:01:48.342">THIS MAN IS NOT A ROBOT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.342" end="00:01:50.644">&gt;&gt; AND MAYBE IT&apos;S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL ANYWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.644" end="00:01:53.680">&gt;&gt; I KNOW THE PERCENTAGE IS SO SMALL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.680" end="00:01:58.919">SO SMALL OF A PERSON BECOMING PREGNANT FROM A RAPE THAT IT&apos;S... I JUST DON&apos;T EVEN KNOW </p>
<p begin="00:01:58.919" end="00:02:03.690">IF THAT&apos;S IN EQUATION BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT PERCENTAGE IS JUST LIKE... ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.690" end="00:02:04.925">NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT CLOSE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.925" end="00:02:06.460">AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CASES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.460" end="00:02:09.530">&gt;&gt; YEAH, ABOUT... PROBABLY ABOUT 32,000 A YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.530" end="00:02:11.665">&gt;&gt; IS IT 32?</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.665" end="00:02:15.102">&gt;&gt; THOUSAND.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.102" end="00:02:15.469">32,000.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.469" end="00:02:16.470">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.470" end="00:02:19.239">&gt;&gt; SO WHY ISN&apos;T MITT ROMNEY ACCEPTING THE PLATFORM?</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.239" end="00:02:21.375">HE IS THE NOMINEE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.375" end="00:02:25.179">&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, WE LIVE IN A FREE SOCIETY WELL LIVE IN AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.179" end="00:02:31.685">IT&apos;S UP TO ANY HUMAN BEING TO CHOOSE, TO DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEMSELVES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.685" end="00:02:34.721">&gt;&gt; IT IS ROMNEY&apos;S CHOICE TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE PLATFORM?</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.721" end="00:02:35.255">WELL, OF COURSE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.255" end="00:02:38.592">WHO ARE WE TO TELL SOMEONE HOW THEY SHOULD ACT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.592" end="00:02:42.596">&gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT FORCING GOVERNOR ROMNEY TO ACCEPT ANYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.596" end="00:02:44.565">&gt;&gt; BUT SHOULD THEY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.565" end="00:02:47.734">I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM UP THERE, HE WANTS THAT PLATFORM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.734" end="00:02:48.569">&gt;&gt; SURE, HE DOES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.569" end="00:02:51.305">&gt;&gt; THE MAN WANTS TO BE THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.305" end="00:02:58.512">&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU NOT SEEN HIM UP THERE WITH HIS SALT-AND-PEPPER HAIR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.512" end="00:03:00.247">HE&apos;S BEGGING FOR THAT PLATFORM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.247" end="00:03:04.117">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T FEEL THAT IT&apos;S EVER REALLY FORCED ON ANYBODY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.117" end="00:03:04.585">I THINK...</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.585" end="00:03:06.553">&gt;&gt; OKAY, DON&apos;T GO THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.553" end="00:03:08.856">DO NOT GO THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.856" end="00:03:10.123">AND BESIDES...</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.123" end="00:03:13.360">&gt;&gt; I DO NOT BELIEVE FOR ONE SECOND THAT HE&apos;S MADE THIS DECISION LIGHTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:17.698">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S HARD TO MAKE THAT DECISION UNLESS YOU&apos;RE THE ONE IN THAT SITUATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.698" end="00:03:18.565">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.565" end="00:03:20.400">UNLESS YOU ARE IN THAT PROCESS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.371">HOW CAN YOU MAKE THAT DECISION FOR SOMEBODY ELSE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.371" end="00:03:25.939">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.939" end="00:03:30.244">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A REALLY PERSONAL ISSUE DECIDING WHAT PEOPLE&apos;S PERSONAL ISSUES ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.244" end="00:03:31.478">&gt;&gt; IT CERTAINLY IS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.478" end="00:03:35.182">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M GOING TO PLAY THE PLANK OF THE G.O.P. PLATFORM AND I </p>
<p begin="00:03:35.182" end="00:03:40.387">NEED YOU TO TELL ME WHY I MAY NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AS A POLICY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.387" end="00:03:45.459">PLEASE REFER TO ME AS &quot;LIL PLATFORM.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:45.459" end="00:03:49.496">&gt;&gt; LIL PLATFORM, THIS MAY NOT BE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MOMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.496" end="00:03:52.733">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S AN INCONVENIENT TIME FOR ME TO BECOME POLICY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.733" end="00:03:57.437">&gt;&gt; WE WILL CONSIDER YOU AT ANOTHER DAY IF THE TIME IS RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.437" end="00:03:58.872">&gt;&gt; WHEN THE TIMING&apos;S BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.872" end="00:04:01.708">&gt;&gt; YES, LIL PLATFORM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.708" end="00:04:02.075">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:04:02.075" end="00:04:05.846">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE FOR THESE DELEGATES THERE&apos;S ONE IDEAL THAT THRIVES ABOVE ALL OTHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.846" end="00:04:08.282">&gt;&gt; THE GOVERNMENT HAS A PURPOSE AND WE LOSE SIGHT OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.282" end="00:04:12.286">AND THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT YOUR INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.286" end="00:04:15.155">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S WHAT OUR COUNTRY, THE INDIVIDUALISM.</p>
