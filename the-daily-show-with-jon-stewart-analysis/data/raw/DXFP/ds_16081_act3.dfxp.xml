<p begin="00:00:44.311" end="00:00:45.145">&gt;&gt; CORRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.145" end="00:00:52.419">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHERE PEOPLE READ NEWSPAPERS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.419" end="00:00:52.819">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.819" end="00:00:55.722">&gt;&gt; OH, IT WAS VERY EXCITING FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME.</p>

<p begin="00:01:05.832" end="00:01:07.734">&gt;&gt; Jon: 21 OF THEM PASSED AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.734" end="00:01:08.635">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S CORRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.635" end="00:01:14.575">SO 24 PEOPLE GET ABOARD THE GREMLIN SPECIAL LEAVING NEW GUINEA TOWARDS THE END OF WORLD WAR II.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.575" end="00:01:15.142">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.142" end="00:01:18.712">&gt;&gt; THE IDEA IS TO FLY OVER THIS VALLEY WHERE THEY DIDN&apos;T KNOW A </p>

<p begin="00:01:34.728" end="00:01:39.266">&gt;&gt; AND TRAGICALLY THE PLANE CRASHED, LEAVING ONLY THREE SURVIVORS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.266" end="00:01:43.103">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO THE SURVIVORS ARE VERY FEARFUL THAT THEY&apos;RE ABOUT </p>
<p begin="00:01:43.103" end="00:01:49.409">TO ENCOUNTER HEAD HUNTERS AND CANNIBALS THAT ARE OF LEGEND SEVEN FEET TALL.</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.058" end="00:02:07.694">&gt;&gt; BUT THEY&apos;RE NOT TOTALLY NAKED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.694" end="00:02:10.497">THEY WORE GOURDS COVERING THEIR GENITALS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.497" end="00:02:13.367">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES, YOU WERE KIND ENOUGH TO BRING ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.367" end="00:02:14.902">DID YOU TRAVEL TO NEW GUINEA?</p>

<p begin="00:02:49.336" end="00:02:53.640">THANK GOD BECAUSE IN MY HOUSE I USE PEANUT SHELLS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.640" end="00:02:55.943">SO THEY HAVE THESE GOURDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.943" end="00:03:05.152">NOW, WHY DIDN&apos;T... WHAT DID THE TRIBE IN NEW GUINEA THINK OF THESE THREE PALE-SKINNED INTERLOPERS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.152" end="00:03:06.053">WHAT DID THEY THINK THEY WERE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.053" end="00:03:09.690">&gt;&gt; WELL, FORTUNATELY FOR THEM THEY REALIZED THEY WERE NOT THEIR ENEMIES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.690" end="00:03:13.293">THEY HAD IN THEIR TRIBE A LEGEND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.293" end="00:03:15.262">IT WAS A PROPHESY THAT SAID,</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.262" end="00:03:20.400">SOME DAYLIGHT-SKINNED GHOSTS WOULD COME FROM DOWN A ROPE FROM THE SKY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.505">AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THESE THREE SURVIVORS WERE THE FULFILLMENT OF THAT PROPHESY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.505" end="00:03:30.711">SO AS A RESULT THAT&apos;S WHY THEY WEREN&apos;T EATEN RIGHT AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.711" end="00:03:34.181">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.181" end="00:03:38.252">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID THE PEOPLE, THE LIGHT-SKINNED PEOPLE, WHY DIDN&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:03:38.252" end="00:03:42.689">THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERED GODS FROM THE SKY, BECAUSE IN THE </p>

<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:50.097">BUT BOY IS THAT AN OPPORTUNITY THAT DOES NOT COME AROUND VERY OFTEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.097" end="00:03:50.764">&gt;&gt; SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.764" end="00:03:52.165">THEY DIDN&apos;T REALIZE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.165" end="00:03:56.870">THEY COULDN&apos;T COMMUNICATE WITH THESE TRIBES PEOPLE, AND SO THEY WERE JUST HAPPY THAT THEY WERE </p>
<p begin="00:03:56.870" end="00:04:00.941">BEING LEFT ALONE AND BEING PROVIDED FOR AND THEY WERE LOOKING AFTER THEM WHILE THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:00.941" end="00:04:03.944">ARMY WAS SCRAMBLING TRYING TO FIGURE OUR HOW THE RESCUE THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.944" end="00:04:06.580">&gt;&gt; Jon: MEANWHILE, THE ARMY FINDS THEM, BUT THEY CAN&apos;T GET </p>
<p begin="00:04:06.580" end="00:04:11.685">TO THEM BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE IN THE MIDDLE OF UNCHARTERED... SO THEY DROP OTHER PEOPLE IN.</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.786" end="00:04:15.389">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THEN THEY CAN&apos;T GET THOSE PEOPLE OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.389" end="00:04:18.659">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S AN ARMY PLAN, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.659" end="00:04:21.061">SO THEY DROP 11 PARATROOPERS IN,</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.061" end="00:04:26.333">LED BY A GUY WHO IS STILL AROUND, A 90-YEAR-OLD GUY EARL WALTER.</p>

<p begin="00:04:28.535" end="00:04:31.171">&gt;&gt; HE&apos;S LIKE WHAT THEY THOUGHT THE CANNIBALS WOULD BE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.171" end="00:04:35.976">AN EARL WALTER LEADS THIS TEAM IN TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE THOUSANDS OF STONE-AGED </p>
<p begin="00:04:35.976" end="00:04:38.912">CANNIBALS WHO LIVE THERE IN THIS VALLEY WHILE THE ARMY IS SAYING,</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.912" end="00:04:41.448">WELL, WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT SOME ESCAPE PLAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.448" end="00:04:43.450">IN THE MEANTIME, LET&apos;S PUT MORE GUYS IN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.450" end="00:04:50.290">&gt;&gt; SO MEANWHILE, THEY SIT IN THE JUNGLE WITH THESE GUYS EATING SPAM AND CANNED BACON FOR LIKE </p>
<p begin="00:04:50.290" end="00:04:50.891">TWO MONTHS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.891" end="00:04:52.125">&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.125" end="00:04:56.196">IT WAS ACTUALLY ALMOST LIKE R&amp;R.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.196" end="00:04:57.097">&gt;&gt; Jon: CRAZY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.097" end="00:04:59.099">THEN THEY DECIDE, LET&apos;S WALK OUT OF HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.099" end="00:05:01.668">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.668" end="00:05:03.303">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET&apos;S DPLIED OUT OF HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.303" end="00:05:06.707">&gt;&gt; THEY REALIZE... NEW GUINEA IS THIS INCREDIBLE TROPICAL JUNGLE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.707" end="00:05:08.041">YOU CAN&apos;T GET OUT OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.041" end="00:05:11.512">SO THEY JUST SAY, WE&apos;RE GOING TO DO THIS, THIS IS OUR PLAN, WE&apos;LL </p>
<p begin="00:05:11.512" end="00:05:17.584">BASICALLY DROP STUFF FOR YOU TO BUILD A MAKESHIFT FOOTBALL GOALPOST, AND WE&apos;LL STRING A </p>
<p begin="00:05:17.584" end="00:05:22.189">RUBBER BAND ACROSS THE TOP OF IT AND WE&apos;LL PUT THAT TO A GLIDER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.189" end="00:05:27.060">AND THEN WE&apos;LL PUT SOME PEOPLE IN THE GLIDER AND THEN WE&apos;LL HAVE OTHER PLANES COME, SWEEP </p>
<p begin="00:05:27.060" end="00:05:29.463">INTO THIS VALLEY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.463" end="00:05:35.068">&gt;&gt; Jon: AT WHAT POINT DID WILEY COYOTE FIGURE INTO THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.068" end="00:05:36.837">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S AN ACME PLAN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.837" end="00:05:44.711">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THE NAME OF THIS GLIDER IS, IF I&apos;M NOT MISTAKEN?</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.711" end="00:05:53.420">&gt;&gt; THE FANLESS FAG DWOT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.420" end="00:05:56.890">&gt;&gt; SO THEY DECIDE THE CLIMB INTO THE FAGGOT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.890" end="00:05:57.591">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.591" end="00:06:01.628">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS THE GREATEST GENERATION WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.628" end="00:06:02.029">CONTINUE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.029" end="00:06:02.696">&gt;&gt; TRUE STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.696" end="00:06:08.068">SO THESE PLANES WILL SWEEP INTO THE VALLEY WITH A HOOK AND GO BY THAT GOALPOST, GRAB THAT RUBBER </p>
<p begin="00:06:08.068" end="00:06:12.406">BAND AND PULL THAT GLIDER UP AND OUT AND OVER THE MOUNTAINS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.406" end="00:06:17.411">NOW, WITH THE PEOPLE ON THE GLIDER DON&apos;T REALIZE IS THAT THESE GLIDERS HAD A NICKNAME IN </p>
<p begin="00:06:17.411" end="00:06:19.947">WORLD WAR II, THE FLYING COFFIN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.947" end="00:06:21.648">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.648" end="00:06:25.919">&gt;&gt; SO THAT WAS THE ARMY&apos;S RESCUE PLAN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:28.622">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND ODDLY ENOUGH, IT WORKED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.622" end="00:06:29.489">&gt;&gt; INCREDIBLY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.489" end="00:06:33.060">THAT&apos;S WHY WE CALLED IT THE MOST INCREDIBLE RESCUE MISSION OF WORLD WAR II.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.060" end="00:06:34.661">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEN YOU TRACKED THESE PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.661" end="00:06:38.565">THEY ALL LED HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES AND IT&apos;S A MAGNIFICENT STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.565" end="00:06:42.669">YOU&apos;VE NEVER SEEN IT IN A MOVIE BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM LIKE NO ONE I THINK WOULD BUY IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.669" end="00:06:44.204">&gt;&gt; TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.204" end="00:06:48.208">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S THE KIND OF THING WHERE THEN THEY SHOT A PLANE OUT OF A GOALPOST.</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.208" end="00:06:50.077">RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.077" end="00:06:52.446">IT&apos;S ABSOLUTELIEN CREDIBLE.</p>
