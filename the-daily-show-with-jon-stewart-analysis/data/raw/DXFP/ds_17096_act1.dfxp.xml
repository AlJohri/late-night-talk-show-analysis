<p begin="00:01:14.241" end="00:01:16.210">THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.210" end="00:01:19.680">I CAN&apos;T EVEN HEAR YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:23.584">THEY SAY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE IN PLAY THIS ELECTION YEAR.</p>

<p begin="00:01:37.264" end="00:01:40.100">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.100" end="00:01:45.172">THESE CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO DO REAL HEAVY DUTY PANDERING LIKE ON THE SUBJECT OF STUDENT LOANS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.172" end="00:01:50.777">&gt;&gt; 7.4 MILLION UNDERGRADS FROM MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES CURRENTLY RELY ON STUDENT </p>

<p begin="00:01:52.679" end="00:01:57.684">&gt;&gt; FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN RATES RIGHT NOW ARE AT 3.4%.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.684" end="00:02:00.454">IF CONGRESS DOESN&apos;T ACT, IT WILL RISE TO 6.8%.</p>

<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:25.379">OF COURSE THESE TYPES OF ENTITLEMENTS ARE ANATHEMA TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.379" end="00:02:30.817">LET&apos;S SEE HOW THAT WILL BE HANDLED BY THEIR NOMINEE OR SHOULD I SAY ROMNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.817" end="00:02:31.185">TRADEMARK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.185" end="00:02:37.858">&gt;&gt; I FULLY SUPPORT THE EFFORT TO EXTEND THE LOW-INTEREST RATE ON STUDENT LOANS.</p>

<p begin="00:02:44.298" end="00:02:46.533">OF COURSE, HE&apos;S STILL ROMNEY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.533" end="00:02:48.635">THE CANDIDATE WITH A UNCOMMON MAN&apos;S TOUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.635" end="00:02:52.139">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;VE ALWAYS ENCOURAGED YOUNG PEOPLE, TAKE A SHOT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.139" end="00:02:53.006">GO FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.006" end="00:02:53.707">TAKE A RISK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.707" end="00:02:54.975">GET THE EDUCATION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.975" end="00:02:56.210">BORROW MONEY IF YOU HAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.210" end="00:02:58.612">FROM YOUR PARENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.612" end="00:03:04.151">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW, NOW, NOW, OF COURSE I REALIZE NOT EVERYONE&apos;S PARENTS HAVE MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.151" end="00:03:05.052">READILY ACCESSIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.052" end="00:03:10.424">SOME OF YOUR PARENTS PROBABLY HAVE MONEY IN OFF SHORE TRUSTS OR RESTRICTED STOCK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.424" end="00:03:17.231">IN THAT CASE, YOU MIGHT WANT TO AUCTION OFF SOME OF YOUR PARENTS&apos; ART WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.231" end="00:03:18.699">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.699" end="00:03:24.738">SO OBAMA AND ROMNEY AGREE, BUT THE POWER FOR THIS RESIDES IN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.738" end="00:03:28.075">I&apos;M SURE THE REAL OBSTACLE HERE IS HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.075" end="00:03:32.346">&gt;&gt; NOBODY WANTS TO SEE STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES GO UP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.346" end="00:03:34.581">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, MY GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.581" end="00:03:35.582">EVERYBODY AGREES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.582" end="00:03:37.918">THE PLANETS ARE ALIGNING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.918" end="00:03:41.555">THIS IS THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF AQUARIUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.555" end="00:03:49.296">WE&apos;RE GOING TO GET A BILL TO KEEP INTEREST RATES ON STUDENT LOANS, TO KEEP THOSE RATES </p>
<p begin="00:03:49.296" end="00:03:49.930">FROM DOUBLING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.930" end="00:03:54.401">&gt;&gt; THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS THREATENING TO VETO A BILL DESIGNED TO KEEP INTEREST </p>
<p begin="00:03:54.401" end="00:04:01.775">RATES ON STUDENT LOANS FROM DOUBLING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.775" end="00:04:04.344">&gt;&gt; Jon: (BEEP) HAPPENED?</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.344" end="00:04:05.546">WE WERE ALL FRIENDS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.546" end="00:04:06.046">WE AGREED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.046" end="00:04:10.450">WE WERE SONGING SONGS FROM &quot;HAIR.&quot; WHAT&apos;S THE PROBLEM?</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.450" end="00:04:12.920">&gt;&gt; THE ISSUE IS REALLY HOW THEY DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.920" end="00:04:17.057">&gt;&gt; Jon: I KEEP FORGETTING WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS CRAP.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.057" end="00:04:22.963">&gt;&gt; REPUBLICAN ARE PROPOSING WHAT THEY CALL ELIMINATING A SLUSH FUND THAT WAS CREATED BY </p>
<p begin="00:04:22.963" end="00:04:23.463">OBAMA CARE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.463" end="00:04:28.068">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO WOULD BE AGAINST ELIMINATING A SLUSH FUND?</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.068" end="00:04:28.669">SLUSH IS A TERRIBLE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.669" end="00:04:29.203">I&apos;M FROM NEW YORK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.203" end="00:04:30.170">I KNOW SLUSH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.170" end="00:04:35.442">IT&apos;S LIKE A RAIN WATER AND DOG URIEN SLUMPY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.442" end="00:04:37.845">WHAT&apos;S IN THIS SLUSH FUND?</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.845" end="00:04:40.781">&gt;&gt; DEMOCRATS ARE HITTING AT THEM SAYING YOU&apos;RE GOING TO BE </p>
<p begin="00:04:40.781" end="00:04:45.652">TARGETING, IN PART, THINGS FOR WOMEN&apos;S HEALTH, TESTING LIKE MAMMOGRAMS AND THAT KIND OF THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.652" end="00:04:56.530">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, SO THIS IS MORE OF A MAMMOGRAM/PAP SMEAR SLURPY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.530" end="00:05:04.171">YOU KNOW, THAT IS 7/11&apos;S SECOND LEAST POPULAR SLURPY FLAVOR BEHIND BLUE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.171" end="00:05:07.140">ALL RIGHT, DEMOCRATS, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR IT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.140" end="00:05:10.477">&gt;&gt; DEMOCRATS ARE PROPOSING A DIFFERENT WAY TO PAY FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.477" end="00:05:14.615">THEY WANT TO DO WHAT THEY CALL ELIMINATING A CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.615" end="00:05:17.117">&gt;&gt; THERE ARE LOTS OF LOOPHOLES WE COULD CLOSE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.117" end="00:05:20.053">MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED BIG OIL AND BIG GAS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.053" end="00:05:22.289">WE COULD CLOSE THOSE LOOPHOLES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.289" end="00:05:25.058">&gt;&gt; WE HAVE GOT PROPOSALS FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE,</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.058" end="00:05:26.793">FROM OUR FRIENDS IN THE SENATE,</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.793" end="00:05:28.662">THAT WANT TO TAX SMALL BUSINESSES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.662" end="00:05:33.066">THE JOB CREATORS, AT A VERY TIME IN OUR ECONOMY IS IS IN SUCH TROUBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.066" end="00:05:37.437">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE CERTAINLY DON&apos;T WANT TO PUNISH THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AMONGST US.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.437" end="00:05:41.308">MMMM: HOW ABOUT THE MOST ARMED AMONGST US.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.308" end="00:05:47.247">&gt;&gt; IF THIS IS NOT SOMETHING TO PLAY GAMES WITH, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING TO STAND UP AND SAY,</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.247" end="00:05:52.786">HEY, I&apos;M A COST-CUTTER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.786" end="00:05:56.723">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE CAN&apos;T TOUCH OUR ALREADY STREAMLINED DEFENSE BUDGET.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.723" end="00:06:01.495">IT MIGHT AFFECT OUR FLYING HOLLOW GRAM LASER TANK PROGRAM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.495" end="00:06:05.399">BY THE WAY, HERE&apos;S HOW OLD PEOPLE ARE IN FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.399" end="00:06:08.302">THAT GUY IS NAMED MR. YOUNG.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.302" end="00:06:10.404">YOU KNOW WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.404" end="00:06:17.778">( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.778" end="00:06:18.378">BUT THIS IS GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.378" end="00:06:24.585">THIS IS GOOD THAT WE NOW KNOW THE PARAMETERS OF THE CONVERSATION THAT OUR COUNTRY </p>
<p begin="00:06:24.585" end="00:06:25.853">NEEDS TO START HAVING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.853" end="00:06:30.224">EVERYONE IS SAYING IF WE WANT GOVERNMENT TO HELP PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.224" end="00:06:31.525">EVERYONE IS AGREEING ON THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.525" end="00:06:35.462">DEMOCRATS THINK CLOSING LOOPHOLES AND RAISING MAFER GINAL TAX RATES ON THE WEALTHY </p>
<p begin="00:06:35.462" end="00:06:39.666">COULD DISCOVER ANY INCREASES IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.666" end="00:06:45.072">REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT ANY INCREASE SHOULD COME AT THE COST OF OTHER DISCRETIONARY </p>
<p begin="00:06:45.072" end="00:06:45.739">SOCIAL SPENDING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.739" end="00:06:50.410">IT&apos;S AN INTERESTING FUNDAMENTAL DEBATE, ONE THAT WE WOULD BE WELL SERVED TO HAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.410" end="00:06:54.848">NOW IF YOU WILL, LET&apos;S WATCH THE DEBATE WE&apos;RE ACTUALLY HAVING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.848" end="00:07:01.221">&gt;&gt; THEY COME UP WITH A PAY FOR IT THAT IS A DISGRACEFUL,</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.221" end="00:07:05.692">GROTESQUE PAY-FOR THAT GOES AFTER WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE NAME OF PROTECTING STUDENT LOANS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.692" end="00:07:06.660">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE YELLING FIRE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.660" end="00:07:07.294">THERE&apos;S NO FIRE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.294" end="00:07:11.031">&gt;&gt; BUT THEY REALLY SEE NOW IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK WOMEN&apos;S HEALTH.</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.031" end="00:07:18.238">&gt;&gt; ACCUSE US OF WANTING TO GUT WOMEN&apos;S HEALTH IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.238" end="00:07:22.109">&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A LEVEL OF HYPOCRISY ON THIS FLOOR THAT IS STAGGERING.</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.109" end="00:07:24.444">&gt;&gt; IT MAKES ME SO ANGRY.</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.444" end="00:07:27.614">I&apos;M SO ANGRY, I COULD SPIT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.614" end="00:07:33.453">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THE PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH HIM SAY, YOU ARE ACTUALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.453" end="00:07:37.691">WATCHING THIS DEBATE I THINK SPIT WOULD BE THE MOST SUBSTANTIVE THING TO COME OUT OF THIS DEBATE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.691" end="00:07:40.594">IT WAS LAME BUT THERE WAS ONE KIND OF GREAT MOMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.594" end="00:07:45.699">WHEN A CONGRESSMAN FROM MINNESOTA WAS SO VEHEMENTLY DEFENDING THE REPUBLICANS&apos; </p>
<p begin="00:07:45.699" end="00:07:51.572">EXCELLENT TREATMENT OF WOMEN BY... WATCH.</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.572" end="00:07:56.643">&gt;&gt; WHAT WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT IS USING A SLUSH FUND THAT IS PROVIDED TO THE SECRETARY TO </p>

<p begin="00:07:58.512" end="00:08:01.815">THAT IS PERCEIVED AS AN ATTACK SOMEHOW ON WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.815" end="00:08:03.016">WHAT A SURPRISE.</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.016" end="00:08:05.752">IN THIS ELECTION YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.752" end="00:08:07.387">ANOTHER 30 SECONDS PLEASE.</p>

<p begin="00:08:17.731" end="00:08:19.166">SHUT YOUR (BEEP) TRAP.</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.166" end="00:08:20.033">SHUT YOUR MOUTH.</p>
