<p begin="00:01:04.831" end="00:01:06.300">A BIT OF A MISDIRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.300" end="00:01:07.501">WASN&apos;T IT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.501" end="00:01:11.672">ACTUALLY A LOT OF THE CREDIT FOR MRS. PALIN&apos;S RECOVERY AFTER SHE WAS UNFAIRLY LINKED </p>
<p begin="00:01:11.672" end="00:01:17.311">TO THE SHOOTINGS HAS TO GO TO HER NURSE SEAN HANNITY WHO IT WAS CLEAR FROM LAST NIGHT&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:01:17.311" end="00:01:23.283">INTERVIEW WAS READY TO UPGRADE PALIN&apos;S VICTIM STATUS FROM INNOCENT TO JOAN OF ARC.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.283" end="00:01:26.520">&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE CRITICS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:30.357">WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SINGLED OUT AND THE LEFT SINGLED YOU OUT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.357" end="00:01:34.294">YOU SPECIFICALLY SAID WHEN THESE WAR TERMS ARE USED THIS IS NOT A CALL FOR VIOLENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.294" end="00:01:36.496">ALL OF THAT WAS IGNORED BY THE MEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.496" end="00:01:38.131">DOES THAT FRUSTRATE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.131" end="00:01:42.302">I DON&apos;T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE LEFT HAVE BEEN VERY CIVIL TOWARDS YOU OVER THE YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.302" end="00:01:45.606">I REALLY DON&apos;T HEAR YOU COMPLAINING A LOT ABOUT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.606" end="00:01:47.608">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DON&apos;T?</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.608" end="00:01:47.941">REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.941" end="00:01:50.177">YOU DON&apos;T HEAR HER COMPLAINING ABOUT IT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.177" end="00:01:54.047">YOU SHOULD MAYBE WATCH HER WHEN SHE APPEARS ON THE SHOW,</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.047" end="00:01:59.553">ON THE SEAN HANNITY SHOW BECAUSE IT&apos;S HARD TO SEE THROUGH ALL THE PLUMES OF ASS </p>
<p begin="00:01:59.553" end="00:02:00.521">SMOKE YOU&apos;RE BLOWING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.521" end="00:02:03.290">BUT IS IT HARD TO HEAR TOO?</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.290" end="00:02:08.061">BECAUSE WATCHING THE TWO OF YOU INSISTING ON HER EASY-GOING NATURE REMINDS ME OF TAKING MY </p>
<p begin="00:02:08.061" end="00:02:10.097">GRANDMOTHER OUT TO EAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.097" end="00:02:11.131">YOU KNOW ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.131" end="00:02:13.667">I&apos;M EASY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.667" end="00:02:17.938">I&apos;M NOT A COMPLAINER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.938" end="00:02:22.676">IS IT COLD IN HERE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.676" end="00:02:27.881">YOU WOULD THINK AT THESE PRICES THEY&apos;D SHUT A WINDOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.881" end="00:02:31.451">NOT THAT THE GOVERNOR DIDN&apos;T HAVE A VALID COMPLAINT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.451" end="00:02:37.724">&gt;&gt; IN A SITUATION LIKE WE HAVE JUST FACED IN THESE LAST EIGHT DAYS OF BEING FALSELY ACCUSED,</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.724" end="00:02:43.730">OF BEING ACCESSORY TO MURDER I AND OTHERS NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TOO ARE SHEDDING TRUTH,</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.730" end="00:02:45.832">SHEDDING LIGHT ON TRUTH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.832" end="00:02:46.767">LIVES WERE LOST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.767" end="00:02:47.734">PEOPLE WERE INJURED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.734" end="00:02:54.241">A CRAZED GUNMAN THAT I AND YOU AND OTHERS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH INFLUENCING HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.241" end="00:02:59.046">HE IS THE SOLE PERSON I BELIEVE TO BLAME IN THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.046" end="00:03:01.615">&gt;&gt; Jon: CORRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.615" end="00:03:03.550">I AGREE WITH GOVERNOR PALIN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.550" end="00:03:05.853">THAT IS TOTALLY FAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.853" end="00:03:12.159">IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTER MATH OF THE TRAGEDY IT WAS UNDULY AND UNNECESSARILY POLITICIZED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:14.795">GOVERNOR, ARE YOU HAPPY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.795" end="00:03:18.198">NOW LOSE ME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.198" end="00:03:20.734">IN THE SAME INTERVIEW,</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.734" end="00:03:22.569">REFERRING TO THE GUNMAN THIS WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.569" end="00:03:29.009">&gt;&gt; AN APOLITICAL OR PERHAPS EVEN LEFT-LEANING CRIMINAL WHO KILLED THESE INNOCENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.009" end="00:03:32.546">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.546" end="00:03:35.949">DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID RIGHT THERE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.949" end="00:03:38.785">DID YOU SEE IT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.785" end="00:03:45.292">THERE MUST BE A WORD FOR COMPLAINING VOCIFEROUSLY ABOUT A WRONG BEING DONE TO YOU </p>
<p begin="00:03:45.292" end="00:03:50.564">WHILE CASUALLY COMMITTING SAID WRONG YOURSELF WITH NO AWARENESS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.564" end="00:03:53.534">IF IT&apos;S NOT A WORD LET&apos;S COME WITH UP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.534" end="00:03:56.436">LET&apos;S CALL IT AN ANCHORAGE STEAMER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.436" end="00:03:57.137">WAIT, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.137" end="00:04:02.009">HOLD ON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.009" end="00:04:05.279">A PALIN-DROME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.279" end="00:04:06.813">HERE&apos;S ANOTHER ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.813" end="00:04:09.816">HERE&apos;S ANOTHER ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.816" end="00:04:19.826">IN THE INTERVIEW, IN THE INTERVIEW, GOVERNOR PALIN WAS RIGHTLY ANNOYED THAT PEOPLE </p>
<p begin="00:04:19.826" end="00:04:26.867">READ INTO HER CROSS HAIRS MAP AND HER DON&apos;T RETREAT RELOAD STATEMENTS AS AN ATTEMPT TO INCITE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.867" end="00:04:34.341">&gt;&gt; WELL, I HAVE REPEATED OVER AND OVER MY CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE AND SPECIFICALLY </p>
<p begin="00:04:34.341" end="00:04:40.247">TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BEING UP IN ARMS WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT GET TO GO </p>
<p begin="00:04:40.247" end="00:04:41.615">THE VOTING BOOTH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.615" end="00:04:42.616">BUT THAT WAS FRUSTRATING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.616" end="00:04:44.618">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU SEE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.618" end="00:04:45.853">SHE&apos;S FRUSTRATED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.853" end="00:04:51.892">IT&apos;S FRUSTRATING TO SARAH PALIN TO HAVE PEOPLE ASCRIBE OVERWHELMINGLY NEGATIVE </p>
<p begin="00:04:51.892" end="00:04:55.195">MOTIVATIONS TO HER INNOCENT ACTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.195" end="00:04:57.364">AND THAT&apos;S UNDERSTANDABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.364" end="00:05:02.603">BY THE WAY, WHY DID PEOPLE LINK HER TO THE SHOOTING IN TUCSON?</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.603" end="00:05:05.706">HERE COMES THE CARIBOU BALL SWITCH HE WILL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.706" end="00:05:08.041">&gt;&gt; THOSE ON THE LEFT HATE MY MESSAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.041" end="00:05:10.010">THEY&apos;LL DO ALL THAT THEY CAN TO STOP ME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.010" end="00:05:11.345">THERE ARE MANY ON THE LEFT,</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.345" end="00:05:13.447">MANY CRITICS WHO DON&apos;T WANT,</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.447" end="00:05:17.584">FOR INSTANCE, CONGRESS TO BUCKLE DOWN, GET BACK TO WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.584" end="00:05:21.588">THERE&apos;S THIS TRIFECTA THING GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW THAT IS GOING TO BRING </p>
<p begin="00:05:21.588" end="00:05:22.923">AMERICA TO HER KNEES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.923" end="00:05:27.094">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU SEE WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.094" end="00:05:32.366">YOUR CRITICS AREN&apos;T MOTIVATED BY A SINCERE BELIEF IN THE CORROSIVE NATURE OF YOUR </p>
<p begin="00:05:32.366" end="00:05:37.471">RECEIPT I CAN, THEY MUST ONLY SEE AMERICA BROUGHT TO HER KNEES AND DO ANYTHING TO KEEP </p>
<p begin="00:05:37.471" end="00:05:38.805">THEIR FOOT ON THE NECK OF AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.805" end="00:05:44.211">THEY ARE WORKING DESPERATELY TO GET AMERICA TO TAP OUT AND BE AWKWARDLY INTERVIEWED </p>
<p begin="00:05:44.211" end="00:05:45.846">AFTERWARDS BY JOE ROGAN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.846" end="00:05:52.653">IS IT POSSIBLE, GOVERNOR, THAT YOU HAVE BECOME A LIGHTNING ROD LESS FOR YOUR CLARITY OF </p>
<p begin="00:05:52.653" end="00:05:59.326">VISION BUT MORE FOR YOUR ABILITY TO TURN ANY CRITICISM OF YOU INTO PERSECUTION OF YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.326" end="00:06:05.232">WHILE STILL VERY CASUALLY BEING ABLE TO DISMISS A PRETTY LARGE PORTION OF AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.232" end="00:06:14.408">&gt;&gt; THOSE ON THE LEFT, IF IT WEREN&apos;T FOR THEIR DOUBLE STANDARD, THEY&apos;D HAVE NO STANDARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.408" end="00:06:21.014">&gt;&gt; Jon: SOMEONE HAS A NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.014" end="00:06:26.753">I MEAN, DO YOU SEE IT AT ALL?</p>
