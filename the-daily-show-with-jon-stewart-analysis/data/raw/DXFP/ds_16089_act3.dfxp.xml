<p begin="00:00:06.073" end="00:00:10.377">MY GUEST TONIGHT PROFESSOR AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY&apos;S STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, HIS NEW BOOK </p>
<p begin="00:00:10.377" end="00:00:15.215">WHICH HE COAUTHORED IS CALLED &quot;GUARANTEED TO FAIL FANNIE MAE,</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.215" end="00:00:20.053">FREDDIE MAC AND THE DEBACLE OF MORTGAGE FINANCE.&quot; PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM </p>
<p begin="00:00:20.053" end="00:00:22.890">MATTHEW RICHARDSON.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.890" end="00:00:23.223">SIR -- </p>
<p begin="00:00:23.223" end="00:00:27.861">[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.861" end="00:00:28.862">THANKS FOR BEING HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.862" end="00:00:30.998">&gt;&gt; FEELS GOOD TO BE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.998" end="00:00:34.768">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED GUARANTEED TO FAIL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.768" end="00:00:41.308">IT FEELS LIKE THEY HAVEN&apos;T GOTTEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ATTENTION AS FAR AS OUR ENTIRE </p>
<p begin="00:00:41.308" end="00:00:48.215">MORTGAGE DEBACLE AND CRASHING OF THE ECHMM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.215" end="00:00:48.682">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.682" end="00:00:52.953">WHAT IS YOUR FEELING -- ARE THEY PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS COLLAPSE?</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.953" end="00:00:53.420">PARTIALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.420" end="00:00:54.721">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.721" end="00:01:01.361">I THINK THERE SHOULD BE TREMENDOUS OUTRAGE AT THE MORTGAGE FINANCE SYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.361" end="00:01:04.665">FANNIE AND FREDDIE WERE SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.665" end="00:01:07.467">YOU TOOK THE TWO FIRMS WITH PUBLIC GOVERNMENT BACKING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.467" end="00:01:15.676">THEY WENT FROM JUST A LITTLE BITTY PLAYERS IN THE EARLY 1980&apos;S TO AT THE TIME OF THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.676" end="00:01:21.415">CRISIS THEY OWNED 50% OF MORTGAGE MARKET, $5 TRILLION OF MORTGAGE DEBT AT RISK WITH </p>
<p begin="00:01:21.415" end="00:01:24.751">LITTLE CAPITAL UNDERNEATH IT AND WE&apos;RE PAYING FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.751" end="00:01:26.553">YOU&apos;RE PAYING FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.553" end="00:01:27.421">I&apos;M PAYING FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.421" end="00:01:28.455">THE AUDIENCE IS PAYING FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.455" end="00:01:32.092">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE IDEA IS THAT THE TRICK THEY WERE PULLING WAS THEY </p>
<p begin="00:01:32.092" end="00:01:36.997">GO TO CONGRESS AND SAY, DON&apos;T WORRY YOU&apos;RE NOT ON THE HOOK FOR THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.997" end="00:01:42.436">AND THEY WOULD GO TO WALL STREET AND SAY DON&apos;T WORRY CONGRESS WILL PAY IF THIS GOES SOUTH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.436" end="00:01:45.472">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S EXACTLY CORRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.472" end="00:01:47.107">THEY WERE A PRIVATE FIRM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.107" end="00:01:50.677">THEY MAKE THE PROFITS BUT THE REST WAS BORNE BY THE TAXPAYER,</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.677" end="00:01:54.748">AGAIN, ALL OF US, YOU COMBINE THOSE TOGETHER IT&apos;S A NASTY MIX.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.748" end="00:01:57.818">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DO THEY PRIVATIZE PROFIT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.818" end="00:02:03.524">I&apos;M CURIOUS AS TO HOW PROFIT GETS PRIVATIZED AND LOSSES GET SOCIALIZED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.524" end="00:02:06.493">HOW DOES THAT SEEM TO WORK?</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.493" end="00:02:07.694">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE GUARANTEED TO FAIL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.694" end="00:02:10.230">THEY HAVE NO CAPITAL UNDERNEATH THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.230" end="00:02:13.066">THEY CONTROL A HUGE AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE MARKET.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.066" end="00:02:20.507">IF THINGS GO WELL WHICH THEY DID FOR TEN YEARS, THEY ARE RATING THE MONEY -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:20.507" end="00:02:23.243">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO ARE THE SHAREHOLDERS IS THAT US?</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.243" end="00:02:28.148">&gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE THAT BOUGHT STOCK IN FANNIE AND FREDDIE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.148" end="00:02:29.449">IF YOU BOUGHT THAT STOCK -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:29.449" end="00:02:31.318">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE TO OWN THEIR STOCK?</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.318" end="00:02:31.818">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.818" end="00:02:37.791">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY WERE THEY ALLOWED TO -- I UNDERSTAND IT IS IN MANY RESPECTS A NOBLE ENDEAVOR TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:37.791" end="00:02:42.996">HELP PEOPLE OWN THEIRijIS IT NOT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.996" end="00:02:44.698">ISN&apos;T THERE VALUE TO THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.698" end="00:02:51.104">&gt;&gt; WE SUBSIDIZED HOUSING SOX WE GOT PEOPLE TO BORROW MORE THAN </p>
<p begin="00:02:51.104" end="00:02:55.275">THEY COULD AFFORD TO BUY HOUSES BIGGER THAN THEY TPHAOEFPLD IT&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:02:55.275" end="00:03:01.181">GREAT WHEN EVERYTHING IS GOING UP AND WHEN THE PYRAMID BEGINS TO COLLAPSE YOU FEEL THE PAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.181" end="00:03:04.651">&gt;&gt; Jon: WOULD WE HAVE FELT THE SAME PAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.651" end="00:03:10.357">WHY WAS FANNIE AND FREDDY ALLOWED TO BUY INTO THE DERIVE ACTIVES MARKET.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.357" end="00:03:12.059">WHY DID THEY GET INTO THAT BUSINESS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.059" end="00:03:17.464">&gt;&gt; THEY WERE SIMPLE INSTITUTIONS THEY BOUGHT SIMPLE MORTGAGE BACKED SUPREME COURTS AND </p>
<p begin="00:03:17.464" end="00:03:20.067">GUARANTEE THE DEFAULT RISK ON MORTGAGES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.067" end="00:03:26.073">YOUR POINT ABOUT THE MORTGAGE SECURITIES MARKET IS WELL TAKEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.073" end="00:03:29.343">WE DESCRIBE IT AS A RACE TO THE BOTTOM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.343" end="00:03:36.149">ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC WE CALL IT GODZILLA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.149" end="00:03:41.088">YOU HAVE THE BANKS WE CALL KING CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.088" end="00:03:47.261">WE WANT THE READER TO ENVISION THEY ARE LOOKING AT DOWNTOWN TOKYO LOOK THE AT GODZILLA AND </p>
<p begin="00:03:47.261" end="00:03:53.100">KING KONG BATTLING IT OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.100" end="00:03:55.769">YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH BOTH AND THE LARGE INSTITUTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.769" end="00:04:04.778">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN GODZILLA AND KING KONG ARE ATTACKED IN TOKYO IS THERE A REGULATORY ALIVE THAT </p>
<p begin="00:04:04.778" end="00:04:07.047">COULD ZAP THEM WITH A GAMMA RAY?</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.047" end="00:04:14.955">OR HOW DO YOU BATTLE THAT TYPE OF -- IT STRIKES ME AS, IF WE&apos;RE BACKING THEM AND BACKING THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:14.955" end="00:04:22.829">PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURERS WHO ARE WE NOT BECOMING AND HOW COULD WE AS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC </p>
<p begin="00:04:22.829" end="00:04:24.231">HAVE WON IN THE FIRST PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.231" end="00:04:30.070">&gt;&gt; ONCE YOU MADE THEM KING�� KONG AND GODZILLA THERE&apos;S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.070" end="00:04:33.340">YOU HAVE TO PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.340" end="00:04:41.181">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU HAVE FAITH THERE CAN BE AN AGGRESSIVE STREAMLINE, NOT CUMBERSOME </p>
<p begin="00:04:41.181" end="00:04:47.688">BUREAUCRACY, REGULATORY REGIME THAT COULD CONTROL THESE THINGS OR IS IT POLITCALLY NOT FEASIBLE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.688" end="00:04:49.289">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T KNOW ABOUT THE POLITICS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.289" end="00:04:54.928">IN THE BOOK WE HAVE A THREE-STAGE PLAN TO GET FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW TO WHERE WE WANT TO BE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.928" end="00:04:59.266">FIRST WE STOP MESSING AROUND AND WIND DOWN FANNY AND FREDDIE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.266" end="00:05:04.838">SECOND WE NEED TO WEAN MORTGAGE FINANCE OFF THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.838" end="00:05:06.373">YOU CAN&apos;T DO IT COLD TURKEY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.373" end="00:05:08.842">YOU HAVE TO DO IT GRADUALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.842" end="00:05:12.513">OUR PLAN TAKES A DECADE TO DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.513" end="00:05:15.115">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE&apos;LL BE HERE THEN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.115" end="00:05:18.318">IF THEY FIGHT FOR A DECADE THAT SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.318" end="00:05:20.554">WE&apos;RE ALL GOING TO DIE!</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.554" end="00:05:21.522">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.522" end="00:05:24.191">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S BEEN THREE YEARS WE HAVEN&apos;T DONE ANYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.191" end="00:05:26.126">YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS IT AT SOME POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.126" end="00:05:29.329">YOU WOULD HOPE A PRIVATE MORTGAGE FINANCE SYSTEM WELL FUNCTIONING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.329" end="00:05:34.668">YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT WELL REGULATED AND IF YOU HAVE THAT YOU HAVE A MUCH BETTER </p>
<p begin="00:05:34.668" end="00:05:35.869">FUNCTIONING ECONOMY AFTERWARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.869" end="00:05:45.479">&gt;&gt; Jon: ONE WORD YES OR NO IS THAT -- THERE ANY POSSIBILITY IN THIS UNIVERSE THAT THAT GETS DONE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.479" end="00:05:48.682">&gt;&gt; 50/50.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.682" end="00:05:53.720">&gt;&gt; Jon: &quot;GUARANTEED TO FAIL&quot; IT&apos;S REALLY DISTURBING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.720" end="00:05:54.188">GET IT.</p>
