<p begin="00:03:44.091" end="00:03:49.296">BUT WHEN I WAS BEING BRIEFED AND PUTTING MY SPEECH TOGETHER THEY SAID THEY HAD FOUR DIFFERENT </p>

<p begin="00:03:58.438" end="00:03:58.939">TALKED TO THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.939" end="00:04:04.244">THE GERMANS TALKED TO THEM AND THE GERMANS HAD WARNED US ABOUT THIS FELLOW AND AFTER IT WAS </p>
<p begin="00:04:04.244" end="00:04:12.886">OVER AND WE FOUND NO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THEY SAID WHY DID YOU LISTEN TO THIS GUY IN </p>
<p begin="00:04:12.886" end="00:04:13.587">THE FIRST PLACE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.587" end="00:04:17.691">AND PEOPLE SAID WE DIDN&apos;T THINK IT WAS THAT SOLID IN THE BEGINNING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.691" end="00:04:19.693">AND THE ANSWERS HAVE NEVER BEEN FAIRLY CLEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.693" end="00:04:23.363">BUT A LOT OF THAT INFORMATION WAS ON POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.363" end="00:04:27.434">I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT IF SADDAM HUSSEIN STAYED THERE AND HIS REGIME STAYED IN PLACE AND </p>

<p begin="00:04:51.658" end="00:04:55.462">INTERESTING BECAUSE IN THE DOCTRINE OF WHAT... I DON&apos;T KNOW WHO SAYS IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.462" end="00:05:00.501">WAS IT EINSTEIN WHO SAID YOU CANNOT SIMULTANEOUSLY PREVENT AND PREPARE FOR WAR?</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.501" end="00:05:07.241">DO YOU FIND SOMETIMES THAT IN THE PREPARATION FOR IT BECAUSE OF THE FOCUS NECESSARY TO TAKE A </p>

<p begin="00:05:30.797" end="00:05:33.166">YOU WANT TO SOLVE IT DIPLOMATICALLY, ECONOMICALLY,</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.166" end="00:05:37.704">BUT ONCE YOU START THINKING ABOUT THE MILITARY THERE IS A CERTAIN MOMENTUM AND THAT&apos;S WHY </p>
<p begin="00:05:37.704" end="00:05:42.843">POLITICIANS AND GENERALS HAVE TO BE CARE TO FEEL CONTROL THAT SO IT DOESN&apos;T BECOME THE DRIVER,</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.843" end="00:05:49.216">POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC PEACE BECOMES THE DRIVER AND WHEN THEY FAIL PUT IN </p>

<p begin="00:05:55.923" end="00:05:57.891">BECAUSE I THINK THEY KNOW THE COST OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.891" end="00:06:02.362">WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THINGS ABOUT OPTIMISM, HAS IT BEEN DIFFICULT FOR YOU-- A GUY WITH A </p>
<p begin="00:06:02.362" end="00:06:08.502">STERLING RECORD-- HAS THIS ONE SORT OF VERY KIND OF GLARING BLOT THAT YOU FEEL... HOW DO YOU </p>
<p begin="00:06:08.502" end="00:06:16.176">GET OVER THAT PERSONALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.176" end="00:06:17.277">IT IS A BLOT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.277" end="00:06:19.146">I ANSWER THIS QUESTION ABOUT THAT U.N. SPEECH EVERYDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.146" end="00:06:23.884">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHY I ASKED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.884" end="00:06:25.619">&gt;&gt; YOUR DIDN&apos;T HAVE TO KEEP THE RECORD GOING.</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.054" end="00:06:30.624">&gt;&gt; BUT YOU HAVE TO GET OVER IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.624" end="00:06:34.294">I MAKE THIS CLEAR IN THE BOOK AND IN OTHER WAYS TALKING TO YOUNG PEOPLE.</p>
