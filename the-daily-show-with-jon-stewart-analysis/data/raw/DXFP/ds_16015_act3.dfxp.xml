<p begin="00:00:04.571" end="00:00:05.873">&gt;&gt; Jon:  WELCOME BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.873" end="00:00:13.113">MY GUEST TONIGHT NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT FROM &quot;NEWS WEEK&quot; AND A BESTSELLING AUTHOR WHOSE </p>
<p begin="00:00:13.113" end="00:00:19.520">LATEST BOOK,&quot;THE PROMISE:  PRESIDENT OBAMA YEAR ONE&quot; IS NOW OUT IN PAIP BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.520" end="00:00:20.454">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM,</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.454" end="00:00:28.962">JONATHAN ALTER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.962" end="00:00:33.467">THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON OUR HISTORIC STATE OF THE UNION COVERAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.467" end="00:00:39.873">THE &quot;THE PROMISE:  PRESIDENT OBAMA PART ONE.&quot; THIS WAS HIS SECOND STATE OF THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:39.873" end="00:00:41.742">UNION ADDRESS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.742" end="00:00:43.243">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S CORRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.243" end="00:00:44.478">&gt;&gt; Jon:  IS HE BETTER NOW?</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.478" end="00:00:46.446">IS HE A BETTER PRESIDENT THAN HE WAS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.446" end="00:00:47.314">&gt;&gt; I THINK HE IS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.314" end="00:00:50.617">IT&apos;S ACTUALLY THE FOURTH TIME HE&apos;S APPEARED BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.617" end="00:00:52.186">THIS IS HIS VENUE OF CHOICE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.186" end="00:00:55.455">IT&apos;S BETTER WHEN HE HAS AN AUDIENCE TO INTERACT WITH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.455" end="00:00:57.925">HE&apos;S NOT AS GOOD IN THE OVAL OFFICE ADDRESSES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.925" end="00:01:00.093">HE TEND TO DO WELL IN THESE EVENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.093" end="00:01:04.598">HE DID WELL WHEN HE ADDRESSED CONGRESS ABOUT HEALTH CARE IN THE FALL OF 2009.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.598" end="00:01:11.205">BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE BIG SURPRISE ABOUT OBAMA IS WE EXPECTED HIM TO BE THIS GREAT </p>
<p begin="00:01:11.205" end="00:01:15.509">COMMUNICATOR, AND TO STRUGGLE IN EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP, STRUGGLE AT GETTING THINGS DONE BECAUSE </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:17.010">HE HAD NO EXPERIENCE, YOU KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.010" end="00:01:19.346">AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE REVERSE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.346" end="00:01:24.084">HE STRUGGLED MOST THE TIME TO COMMUNICATE, TO CONNECT WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.084" end="00:01:24.818">&gt;&gt; Jon:  RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.818" end="00:01:31.458">&gt;&gt; AND, YET, HE&apos;S ACCOMPLISHED MORE IN TERMSES-RECORD THAN ANY </p>
<p begin="00:01:31.458" end="00:01:33.861">PRESIDENT SINCE LYNDON JOHNSON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.861" end="00:01:35.429">&gt;&gt; Jon:  HOW DO YOU JUDGE THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.429" end="00:01:37.164">&gt;&gt; I DO A LOT OF THAT IN THE BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.164" end="00:01:42.569">A LOT OF IT IS SORT OF BEHIND-THE-SCENES STORIES OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY CLOSE THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:42.569" end="00:01:46.907">DOOR TO THE OVAL OFFICE BUT A LOT OF IT IS TO SAY HOW DOES HE STACK UP?</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.907" end="00:01:50.844">&gt;&gt; Jon:  IS THE METRIC JUST WHAT HE GETS DONE OR THE AMOUNT THAT HE GETS DONE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.844" end="00:01:55.682">BECAUSE I IMAGINE THAT THERE IS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS AND A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.682" end="00:02:02.923">SO IMAGINE QUANTITATIVELY YOU CAN SAY HE&apos;S GOTTEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT DONE BUT NOW CHILDREN </p>
<p begin="00:02:02.923" end="00:02:05.659">UNDER 5 ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LIVE AT HOME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.659" end="00:02:09.563">MATCHING IT UP, IT SEEMS HARD TO ADJUST LYNDON JOHNSON&apos;S CIVIL </p>
<p begin="00:02:09.563" end="00:02:12.633">RIGHTS ACT TO MAYBE DON&apos;T ASK,</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.633" end="00:02:13.300">DON&apos;T TELL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.300" end="00:02:15.903">I GUESS THAT WOULD BE THE ANALOGOUS LEGISLATION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.903" end="00:02:18.005">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M NOT SAYING HE EXCEEDED JOHNSON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.005" end="00:02:23.277">WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOCIAL LEGISLATION, THE HEALTH CARE BILL IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF </p>
<p begin="00:02:23.277" end="00:02:26.079">SOCIAL LEGISLATION SINCE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:26.079" end="00:02:29.383">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER THE HEALTH CARE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.383" end="00:02:31.185">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;VE BEEN TOLD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.185" end="00:02:37.357">BUT INSURING 30 MILLION AMERICANS AND ENDING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SICK PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.357" end="00:02:38.425">I THINK WE&apos;LL LOOK BACK AND SAY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.425" end="00:02:44.565">&quot;CAN YOU BELIEVE WE USED TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE IF YOU GOT CANCER YOU HAD TO SELL YOUR </p>
<p begin="00:02:44.565" end="00:02:49.002">HOUSE.&quot; WE&apos;RE NOT GOING TO LIVE IN THAT COUNTRY ANY MORE, AND THAT&apos;S A GOOD THING </p>
<p begin="00:02:49.002" end="00:02:49.837">( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.837" end="00:02:50.637">&gt;&gt; Jon:  UNTIL, OBVIOUSLY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.637" end="00:02:55.976">IT&apos;S REPEALED ( LAUGHTER ) THEN YOU LIVE IN THAT COUNTRY FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.976" end="00:03:02.416">I WAS SURPRISED WHEN HE WENT WITH -- THEY HAVE TO GO WITH A CERTAIN URGING US ON IN THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:02.416" end="00:03:06.787">STATE OF THE STIEWN-- WITH THE PHRASE, WE CAN WIN THE FUTURE.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:06.787" end="00:03:10.657">&gt;&gt; YEAH, THEY WANT THAT TO BE THEIR BUZZWORD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.657" end="00:03:11.825">THEY TITLE THE THE SPEECH -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:11.825" end="00:03:12.826">&gt;&gt; WIN THE FUTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.826" end="00:03:15.863">I DIDN&apos;T KNOW WE WERE TRYING TO DEFEAT THE FUTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.863" end="00:03:18.966">BECAUSE THE FUTURE ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE, NO MATTER WHAT, IT WINS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.966" end="00:03:21.201">THERE&apos;S A CERTAIN INEVITABILITY TO THE FUTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.201" end="00:03:26.173">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THIS IS PART OF THEIR EFFORT TO TURN THIS INTO A COMPETITION BECAUSE THEY KNOW </p>
<p begin="00:03:26.173" end="00:03:27.407">AMERICANS LIKE TO COMPETE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.407" end="00:03:32.446">AND I DO THINK THERE WAS A CERTAIN TONE TO THE SPEECH, A STRUCT TOWER IT WHERE HE SAID,</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.446" end="00:03:36.283">YOU KNOW, WE WILL OUT-INNOVATE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.283" end="00:03:38.285">OUT-EDUCATE, AND OUT-BUILD THE REST OF THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.285" end="00:03:45.325">AND HE KNOWS THAT THIS SPUTNIK MOMENT DOES GET PEOPLE&apos;S USES FLOWING A LITTLE BIT-- ALTHOUGH,</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.325" end="00:03:50.597">AS YOU POINT OUT MAYBE NOT FOR AS BIG ENDS AS J.F.K. WAS LOOKING FOR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.597" end="00:03:53.901">HE HAS BEEN KIND OF SOUNDBITE CHALLENGED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.901" end="00:03:59.907">THERE&apos;S NOT A LOT TO CHISEL AND MARBLE MUCH LESS TWEAK ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS HE SAYS AND I </p>
<p begin="00:03:59.907" end="00:04:05.779">THINK THEY&apos;RE TRYING TO FIX THAT A LITTLE BIT, THAT HE NEEDS SOME SLOGANS GOING INTO THE NEXT CAMPAIGN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.779" end="00:04:09.616">&gt;&gt; Jon:  THERE ARE PEOPLE SITTING IN A ROOM IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WITH A BLACKBOARD, AND </p>
<p begin="00:04:09.616" end="00:04:11.118">THEY&apos;RE JUST THROWING OUT LIKE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.118" end="00:04:16.623">&quot;WIN THE FUTURE.&quot; AND THEN SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE LIKE, &quot;U.S.A.  FEAR FACTOR.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:04:16.623" end="00:04:19.993">YOU KNOW, WE CAN EAT MORE BULL TESTICLES THAN CHINA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.993" end="00:04:26.567">LIKE THAT KIND OF THING, SETTING IT UP AS THOUGH THE WAY TO PROD US, TO MOVE FORWARD, THEY FEEL </p>
<p begin="00:04:26.567" end="00:04:32.139">THAT IT HAS TO BE PITHY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.139" end="00:04:34.308">&gt;&gt; AND THEY&apos;VE HAD A PITHY PROBLEM?</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.308" end="00:04:35.576">&gt;&gt; Jon:  HAVE THEY?</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.576" end="00:04:39.479">AS YOU AGE, IT&apos;S HARDER AND HARDER TO TELL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.479" end="00:04:44.852">&gt;&gt; THEY HAD A PROFESSORIAL PITHY PROBLEM WHICH THEY ADDRESSED A LITTLE BIT LAST NIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.852" end="00:04:46.954">IT WAS LESS PROFESSORIAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.954" end="00:04:48.789">&gt;&gt; Jon:  DO YOU SENSE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.789" end="00:04:51.158">THOUGH, THAT AMERICANS HAVE THAT-- THAT SENSE OF, LIKE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.158" end="00:04:53.293">DON&apos;T WE NEED TO BE GIVEN A GOAL?</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.293" end="00:04:57.531">ONCE YOU SAY, &quot;THIS IS OUR SPUTNIK MOMENT&quot; ISN&apos;T YOUR NEXT </p>
<p begin="00:04:57.531" end="00:05:01.902">STEP TO SAY, &quot;SO HERE&apos;S WHERE WE&apos;RE GOING,&quot; RATHER THAN THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:01.902" end="00:05:06.607">LIST OF THINGS THAT HE LISTED THAT WERE OUR GOALS OF ACHIEVEMENT SOUNDED VERY SIMILAR </p>
<p begin="00:05:06.607" end="00:05:08.775">TO EVERY STATE OF THE UNION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.775" end="00:05:11.612">I REMEMBER BUSH SAYING WE&apos;RE GOING TO MARS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.612" end="00:05:18.018">HE TALKED ABOUT NO ANIMAL-- HUMAN HUBRIDES OR SOME OTHER THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.018" end="00:05:22.022">OBAMA&apos;S LIST STRUCK ME AS WE&apos;RE GOING TO HAVE 80% WIFI.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.022" end="00:05:26.894">&gt;&gt; OH, WE&apos;RE ALL GOING TO BE DRIVING A NISSAN LEAF OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.894" end="00:05:32.599">&gt;&gt; Jon:  IT DIDN&apos;T STRIKE ME AS A SPUTNIK MOMENT AS LET&apos;S ALL </p>
<p begin="00:05:32.599" end="00:05:34.168">CHANGE OUR LIGHTBULBS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.168" end="00:05:35.269">&gt;&gt; WE DON&apos;T HAVE THE MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.269" end="00:05:37.604">WE DON&apos;T HAVE THE MONEY TO GO TO THE MOON.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.604" end="00:05:39.673">THAT WAS THE INTERNAL INCONSISTENCY HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.673" end="00:05:47.814">THEY LAID OUT AN INVESTMENT AGENDA-- THE REPUBLICANS CALL SPENDING AND THE DEMOCRATS CALL </p>
<p begin="00:05:47.814" end="00:05:48.782">IT INVESTMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.782" end="00:05:53.754">&gt;&gt; Jon:  IT STRIKES ME AS OBAMA BASICALLY IN THE WAY THAT THAT-- WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER AND </p>
<p begin="00:05:53.754" end="00:05:57.858">MAYBE OUR FAMILY DIDN&apos;T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY THAT YEAR, THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:57.858" end="00:05:59.927">BEST CHRISTMAS IS THE POOR CHRISTMAS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.927" end="00:06:01.428">IT&apos;S LIKE, &quot;HEY!</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.428" end="00:06:04.765">WE&apos;RE ALL GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST CHRISTMAS EVER THIS YEAR!</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.765" end="00:06:05.532">YOU KNOW WHY?</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.532" end="00:06:11.271">WE&apos;RE GOING TO MAKE EACH OTHER SOMETHING.&quot; IT&apos;S THAT URGING ON OF, &quot;WE CAN </p>
<p begin="00:06:11.271" end="00:06:11.905">DO THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.905" end="00:06:15.609">IT&apos;S OUR SPUTNIK MOMENT, BUT WE&apos;RE GOING TO USE ALUMINUM FOIL </p>
<p begin="00:06:15.609" end="00:06:17.110">INSTEAD OF A SATELLITE.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:06:17.110" end="00:06:21.782">&gt;&gt; OR WE&apos;RE GOING TO GET RID OF THE SALMON BUREAU WITH THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.782" end="00:06:23.250">&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU&apos;LL BE SURPRISED, ONCE THEY&apos;RE GONE,</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.250" end="00:06:25.419">THE WHOLE THING TURNS AROUND,</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.419" end="00:06:25.719">BABY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.719" end="00:06:26.753">&gt;&gt; THEY COULD REORGANIZE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.753" end="00:06:30.324">THAT COULD BE THE BIG THING COMING OUT OF THE SPEECH, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.324" end="00:06:33.727">THEY DO HAVE A REAL, 21st CENTURY REORGANIZATION.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.727" end="00:06:38.065">A LOT OF TIMES THEY&apos;RE JUST MOVING THE PIECES ON THE ORGANIZATION CHART, BUT IF HE </p>
<p begin="00:06:38.065" end="00:06:42.169">MAKES GOOD ON THAT, THE REPUBLICANS MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT, TOO, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO </p>
<p begin="00:06:42.169" end="00:06:48.041">TELL THEIR CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY WHACKED SOME AGENCIES SO THERE ARE SOME AREAS, PERHAPS </p>
<p begin="00:06:48.041" end="00:06:48.909">IMMIGRATION-- ( LAUGHTER ).</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.909" end="00:06:54.047">&gt;&gt; Jon:  THE REPUBLICANS JUST GO BACK TO THE DISTRICT LIKE, &quot;I TOOK CARE OF THAT THING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.047" end="00:07:02.022">&quot;THE PROMISE:  PRESIDENT OBAMA YEAR ONE&quot; IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.022" end="00:07:05.492">&gt;&gt; I&apos;VE GOT YEAR TWO IN THE PAPERBACK.</p>
