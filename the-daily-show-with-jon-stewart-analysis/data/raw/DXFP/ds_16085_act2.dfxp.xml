<p begin="00:00:07.074" end="00:00:11.011">MADE... MADE... MADE IN AMERICA USED TO MEAN SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.011" end="00:00:13.914">MOSTLY THAT WE HAD JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.914" end="00:00:14.314">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.314" end="00:00:15.249">HERE IN AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.249" end="00:00:19.186">BUT WITH SO MANY OF THESE JOBS GOING OVERSEAS, AMERICA HAS BUT ONE CHOICE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.186" end="00:00:20.487">JASON JONES HAS MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.487" end="00:00:23.290">&gt;&gt; FOR YEARS AMERICA FACED A GREAT THREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.290" end="00:00:24.992">&gt;&gt; SOCIALISM IS COMING OUR WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.992" end="00:00:27.261">&gt;&gt; WE WANT TO GO TO IRAQ.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.261" end="00:00:30.597">&gt;&gt; DO WE REALLY WANT TO CHANGE AMERICA INTO SWEDEN?</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.597" end="00:00:35.869">&gt;&gt; BUT WHEN SWEDEN OPENED UP AN IKEA FACTORY IN VIRGINIA,</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.869" end="00:00:37.437">SOCIALISM BECAME THE LEAST OF OUR WORRIES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.437" end="00:00:40.707">&gt;&gt; WHEN THEY FIRST SHOWED UP IN DANVILLE, VIRGINIA, WE THOUGHT,</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.707" end="00:00:45.779">THIS IS IKEA, THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST, BUT WORKERS ARE DISRESPECTED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.779" end="00:00:46.680">THEY&apos;RE ABUSED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.680" end="00:00:47.814">THEY DON&apos;T GET CORRECT TRAINING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.814" end="00:00:50.050">THEY DON&apos;T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE ENDS MEET.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.050" end="00:00:51.051">THEY&apos;RE NOT PAID ENOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.051" end="00:00:56.723">THEY&apos;RE TREATING THESE WORKERS AS IF IT&apos;S A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.723" end="00:01:06.133">&gt;&gt; TO FIND OUT MORE, I MET SWEDISH BUSINESS EXPERT LARS BARGAINS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.133" end="00:01:06.466">WELCOME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.466" end="00:01:07.334">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.334" end="00:01:10.470">&gt;&gt; IN A ROOM FILLED WITH THE COMFORTS OF HIS HOMELAND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.470" end="00:01:14.541">HAVE A SEAT, PLEASE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.541" end="00:01:15.309">&gt;&gt; OH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.309" end="00:01:19.713">&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE IS A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT SWEDEN WHICH WE HAVE TO CORRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.713" end="00:01:23.083">WE FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN CAPITALISTS AND VERY GOOD AT IT,</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.083" end="00:01:25.452">BUT IT&apos;S TRUE THAT WE ALSO LEARNED FROM THE MASTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.452" end="00:01:28.522">NOW YOU&apos;RE WORKING FOR US, WHICH IS THE WAY IT TURNS AROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.522" end="00:01:32.259">&gt;&gt; GOD, LOOK AT YOU, SO SMUG.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.259" end="00:01:33.527">&gt;&gt; YOU THINK I&apos;M SMUG.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.527" end="00:01:34.528">&gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.528" end="00:01:35.929">&gt;&gt; LITTLE BIT, YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.929" end="00:01:37.831">&gt;&gt; WE USED TO BE THAT SMUG.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.831" end="00:01:40.567">HOW DO WE GET TO BE THAT SMUG AGAIN?</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.567" end="00:01:43.170">&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT&apos;S THE $1 MILLION QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.170" end="00:01:47.274">&gt;&gt; SWEDEN WAS EVERYTHING WE USED TO BE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.274" end="00:01:50.310">[DANCING QUEEN PLAYING]</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.310" end="00:01:52.913">DOMINANT, ARROGANT AND SO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.913" end="00:01:56.517">BUT IF SWEDEN WAS US, WHO WERE WE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.517" end="00:01:59.286">&gt;&gt; WE HAVE, IN FACT, BECOME SWEDEN&apos;S MEXICO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.286" end="00:02:00.254">&gt;&gt; REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.254" end="00:02:01.054">&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.054" end="00:02:04.057">&gt;&gt; BUT IF WE WANT TO WORK, WE GOT TO BE SOMEBODY&apos;S MEXICO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.057" end="00:02:11.465">&gt;&gt; IF YOU&apos;RE SUGGESTING THAT THE CHOICE IN AMERICA IS TO WORK FOR </p>
<p begin="00:02:11.465" end="00:02:17.137">DANGEROUS WORK, DISRESPECTFUL WORK, DEGRADING WORK AT MINIMUM WAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.137" end="00:02:17.638">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.638" end="00:02:19.306">&gt;&gt; THEN MY STATEMENT TO YOU,</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.306" end="00:02:20.741">SIR, IS THAT IS UNAMERICAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.741" end="00:02:21.708">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.708" end="00:02:22.776">IT&apos;S MEXICAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.776" end="00:02:25.312">&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU BEEN TO A MEXICAN FACTORY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.312" end="00:02:25.646">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.646" end="00:02:32.719">&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE BRUTAL WORK CONDITIONS, LONG HOURS, LOW PAY.</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.730" end="00:02:49.903">THE WATER SUPPLY COMES FROM THE EFFLUENT FROM THE FACTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.903" end="00:02:51.672">&gt;&gt; NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.672" end="00:02:52.840">&gt;&gt; WHICH ONE WERE YOU AT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.840" end="00:02:54.541">&gt;&gt; THE ONE IN MY HEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.541" end="00:02:59.413">AND THE PROBLEM IS OUR AMERICAN-RUN AMERICAN FACTORIES LIKE THIS ONE CAN&apos;T COMPETE WITH </p>
<p begin="00:02:59.413" end="00:03:01.582">OUR SWEDISH-RUN MEXICAN FACTORIES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.582" end="00:03:03.483">THESE GUYS SEEM LIKE COMPLETE WASTES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.483" end="00:03:06.954">THE CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE ASSEMBLING IT THEMSELVES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.954" end="00:03:09.156">&gt;&gt; WE HAVEN&apos;T FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.156" end="00:03:12.059">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S CALLED AN ALLEN WRENCH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.059" end="00:03:14.094">&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE&apos;S YOUR FIRST PROBLEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.094" end="00:03:14.695">IT&apos;S COMFORTABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.695" end="00:03:17.931">&gt;&gt; THEY CODDLED THEIR EMPLOYEE AT EVERY TURN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.931" end="00:03:21.602">&gt;&gt; WHEN DOES THIS GUY GET HIS BATHROOM BREAK?</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.602" end="00:03:22.636">&gt;&gt; BATHROOM BREAK?</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.636" end="00:03:23.704">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.704" end="00:03:26.273">&gt;&gt; WHENEVER HE HAS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.273" end="00:03:28.242">&gt;&gt; OH, WELL, THAT&apos;S JUST STUPID.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.242" end="00:03:33.413">&gt;&gt; WELL, I GUESS WE JUST...</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.413" end="00:03:37.117">&gt;&gt; IF FACTORIES LIKE THIS HOPE TO SURVIVE, THEY&apos;LL HAVE TO MODERNIZE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.117" end="00:03:38.085">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S CLASSIC.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.085" end="00:03:39.586">YOU&apos;LL HAVE IT FOR A LIFETIME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.586" end="00:03:40.721">IT&apos;S GREAT STYLE.</p>

<p begin="00:04:13.053" end="00:04:16.390">&gt;&gt; UNTIL WE GET RECOGNIZE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS THE UNION </p>
<p begin="00:04:16.390" end="00:04:19.126">FOR DANVILLE, THEY&apos;RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE.</p>

<p begin="00:04:34.241" end="00:04:38.579">&gt;&gt; BOTTOM LINE, WE NEED TO LEARN A VERY IMPORTANT LESSON FROM OUR SWEDISH OVERLORDS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.579" end="00:04:40.214">&gt;&gt; THESE ARE BUSINESS PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.214" end="00:04:42.482">THEY DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO MAKE A BUCK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.482" end="00:04:44.251">&gt;&gt; OKAY.</p>
