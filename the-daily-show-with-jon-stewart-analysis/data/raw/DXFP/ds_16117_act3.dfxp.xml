<p begin="00:01:26.720" end="00:01:33.594">BUT I AM REALLY STRUCK BY HOW MUCH COURAGE IT TOOK FOR HER TO DO THIS AND HOW MUCH-- HOW </p>
<p begin="00:01:33.594" end="00:01:34.962">COMPLEX AND INTERESTING IT IS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.962" end="00:01:38.866">AND IT REALLY BRINGS A WHOLE WORLD TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT-- IT&apos;S GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION </p>
<p begin="00:01:38.866" end="00:01:43.303">IN THE LAST FEW DAYS-- BUT I THINK IF YOU SIT AND LISTEN OR READ WHOLE THING, IT IS LIKE </p>

<p begin="00:03:42.523" end="00:03:46.093">IT KNEW HOW TO GO DOWN THE SLIDE FROM THE TREE HOUSE TO THE GROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.093" end="00:03:50.330">IT WAS REALLY PRETTY CUTE BUT IT WAS REALLY NERVOUS, AND SHE DESCRIBES HOW SHE THINKS IT HAD </p>
<p begin="00:03:50.330" end="00:03:54.735">NEVER OPINION OUT OF THE LABORATORY BECAUSE IT JUST BIT EVERYONE, ONE OF THE GARDNERS AT </p>
