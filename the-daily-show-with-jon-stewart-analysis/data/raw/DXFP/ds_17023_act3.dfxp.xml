<p begin="00:02:03.924" end="00:02:05.492">&gt;&gt; Jon:  IT REALLY IS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.492" end="00:02:10.931">IS IT HARD TO REVISIT-- YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER WAS A VERY COMPLICATED, ARTISTIC, TALENTED </p>
<p begin="00:02:10.931" end="00:02:13.066">WOMAN, BUT SHE KEPT THESE DIARIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.066" end="00:02:16.570">&gt;&gt; RIGHT 85, 85 JOURNALS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.570" end="00:02:19.773">AND I NEVER READ THEM IN THE COURSE OF HER LIFETIME BECAUSE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.773" end="00:02:24.077">OF COURSE, MY MOTHER WAS SO-- SHE WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL WOMAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.077" end="00:02:26.079">HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR MOM?</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.079" end="00:02:27.147">&gt;&gt; Jon:  SHE&apos;S OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.147" end="00:02:30.083">( LAUGHTER ).</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.083" end="00:02:32.119">&gt;&gt; DOROTHY, DEAR DOROTHY -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:32.119" end="00:02:34.721">&gt;&gt; Stephen:  MY MOTHER&apos;S VERY NICE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.721" end="00:02:35.222">SHE&apos;S WONDERFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.222" end="00:02:35.622">&gt;&gt; Stephen: </p>
<p begin="00:02:35.622" end="00:02:40.994">&gt;&gt; SHE WAS A FANTASTICALLY ACTIVE LISTENER SO THAT MEANT I GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.994" end="00:02:42.196">&gt;&gt; Jon:  FOUR KIDS, THOUGH,</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.196" end="00:02:42.596">FOUR KIDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.596" end="00:02:43.931">&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, FOUR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.931" end="00:02:45.999">I WAS THE FIRST OF FOUR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.999" end="00:02:48.535">BUT SHE WAS JUST AN ASTONISHING HUMAN BEING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.535" end="00:02:53.106">AND I DON&apos;T KNOW, TO ME, THOSE 85 JOURNALS, I DIDN&apos;T REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.106" end="00:02:55.509">I WANTED HER TO CONCENTRATE ON ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.509" end="00:02:55.943">&gt;&gt; Jon:  SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.943" end="00:02:56.577">&gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND?</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.577" end="00:03:00.814">I WAS THE DAUGHTER WHO JUST CHERISHED EVERYTHING THAT SHE HAD TO GIVE ME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.814" end="00:03:03.584">I WASN&apos;T THE DAUGHTER WHO I SHOULD HAVE BEEN, OF COURSE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.584" end="00:03:07.754">WHICH WAS TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHO MY MOTHER WAS AS A HUMAN BEING SEPARATE FROM ME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.754" end="00:03:08.722">GET IT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.722" end="00:03:12.359">SO IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR ME TO GROW UP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.359" end="00:03:16.296">&gt;&gt; Jon:  DID SHE EVER SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.296" end="00:03:18.699">&gt;&gt; NO, BECAUSE SHE KEPT TO HERSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.699" end="00:03:24.972">I THINK THAT HER RELEASE AND HER CATHARTIC EXPERIENCE IN LIFE WAS TO WRITE THESE JOURNALS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.972" end="00:03:28.442">AND SO FINALLY, I BEGAN TO READ HER JOURNALS, AND BASICALLY,</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.442" end="00:03:36.617">THIS BOOK IS USING HER JOURNALS WITH MY WORDS AND JUXTAPOSING OUR LIVES TOGETHER, AND IN SOME </p>
<p begin="00:03:36.617" end="00:03:40.220">WAY I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, MY WISH IN LIFE WAS, OBVIOUSLY, TO BECOME AN ACTRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.220" end="00:03:44.958">AND I FEEL LIKE THE REASON THAT HAPPENED WAS, OF COURSE, BECAUSE OF MY MOTHER, DOROTHY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.958" end="00:03:48.695">&gt;&gt; Jon:  AND ONE OF THE NICE PARTS OF THE BOOK IS TO SEE THEM </p>
<p begin="00:03:48.695" end="00:03:50.631">TAKE SUCH GREAT PLEASURE IN YOUR SUCCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.631" end="00:03:51.331">&gt;&gt; I KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.331" end="00:03:55.402">&gt;&gt; Jon:  AND COME TO SEE YOU, EVEN IN-- THERE&apos;S A GREAT LITTLE NOTE IN THERE YOU WROTE </p>
<p begin="00:03:55.402" end="00:03:58.572">ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE IN &quot;HAIR,&quot; IN THE 70s.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.572" end="00:04:00.941">&gt;&gt; OH, YES, I WAS IN &quot;HAIR.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:04:00.941" end="00:04:04.144">&gt;&gt; Jon:  SHE WAS IN &quot;HAIR.&quot; YOU WRITE-- YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S THIS </p>
<p begin="00:04:04.144" end="00:04:05.145">WHOLE HIPPIE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.145" end="00:04:08.582">I DON&apos;T CARE FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.582" end="00:04:11.418">I&apos;M IN &quot;HAIR,&quot; BUT, YOU KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.418" end="00:04:13.620">&gt;&gt; IT WAS A LITTLE ODD, YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.620" end="00:04:15.355">&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU WERE A CALIFORNIA KID.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.355" end="00:04:16.490">&gt;&gt; COMPLETELY, THE BEACH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.490" end="00:04:17.124">ALWAYS THE BEACH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.124" end="00:04:20.093">WHERE DID YOU GROW UP.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.093" end="00:04:21.762">&gt;&gt; Jon:  CALIFORNIA, THE BEACH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.762" end="00:04:22.829">&gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT I MEAN, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.829" end="00:04:25.599">&gt;&gt; Jon:  NO, NEW JERSEY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.599" end="00:04:31.538">VERY SIMILAR EXCEPT, OBVIOUSLY-- IT&apos;S LIKE CALIFORNIA WITH-- IF YOU WOULD IMAGINE CALIFORNIA </p>
<p begin="00:04:31.538" end="00:04:33.507">WERE A GAS REFINERY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.507" end="00:04:37.811">SIMILAR-- VERY SIMILAR TO...</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.811" end="00:04:39.947">( APPLAUSE ) NO, NEW JERSEY IS BEAUTIFUL,</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.947" end="00:04:40.581">BEAUTIFUL PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.581" end="00:04:42.883">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M BEGINNING TO PICTURE IT NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.883" end="00:04:48.755">&gt;&gt; Jon:  BUT THIS ASTONISH AGO WHEN YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL, YOU DEVELOPED A CRUSH ON </p>
<p begin="00:04:48.755" end="00:04:49.990">AN ACTOR.</p>

<p begin="00:04:50.891" end="00:04:56.230">I HAD A LOT OF CRUSHES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.230" end="00:04:59.633">-- HE WAS MY FIRST UNATTAINABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.633" end="00:05:03.036">BUT WHILE-- YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID TO ME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.036" end="00:05:06.874">WE WROTE NOTES IN MRS.  HOPKIN&apos;S CIVICS CLASS, AND HE WROTE BACK </p>
<p begin="00:05:06.874" end="00:05:11.879">TO ME ONCE AND SAID, &quot;YOU&apos;LL MAKE A GOOD WIFE ONE DAY.&quot; ( LAUGHTER ) </p>
<p begin="00:05:11.879" end="00:05:14.147">AND I THOUGHT, I DON&apos;T WANT TO BE A WIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.147" end="00:05:15.349">I WANT TO BE A HOT DATE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.349" end="00:05:16.083">&gt;&gt; Jon:  RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.083" end="00:05:17.184">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.184" end="00:05:20.587">I DIDN&apos;T WANT THAT AT ALL?</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.587" end="00:05:21.822">I&apos;M NOT A HOT DATE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.822" end="00:05:24.091">&gt;&gt; Jon:  CAN I TELL YOU,</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.351" end="00:05:54.154">&gt;&gt; SO ANYWAY, HE WAS TO DIE FOR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.154" end="00:05:59.326">I HAVE NEVER, EVER SEEN ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL ON FILM I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.326" end="00:06:02.029">&gt;&gt; Jon:  IT&apos;S ALMOST LIKE A POSTER-- </p>
<p begin="00:06:02.029" end="00:06:02.896">&gt;&gt; AND I MET HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.896" end="00:06:04.398">&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU DIDN&apos;T MEET HIM.</p>
