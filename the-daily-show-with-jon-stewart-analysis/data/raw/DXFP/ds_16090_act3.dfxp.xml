<p begin="00:00:23.090" end="00:00:32.199">BEFORE WE GET INTO THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY IN AFGHANISTAN, MAY I JUST SAY,</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.199" end="00:00:35.736">THAT HAND IS SUPER COOL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.736" end="00:00:44.311">HOW DID YOU... WHEN I SHOOK YOUR HAND, IT CURLED AROUND MY HAND WITH A STRONGER GRIP THAN I HAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.311" end="00:00:48.749">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S DESIGNED TO CONFORM TO DIFFERENT OBJECTS THAT ACTUALLY </p>
<p begin="00:00:48.749" end="00:00:52.786">STOPS WHEN EACH FINGER MEETS RESISTANCE TO GIVE YOU MORE DEXTERITY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.786" end="00:00:56.990">WHEN I ACTUALLY LOST IT, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE A HOOK, AND I WAS FINE WITH THAT </p>
<p begin="00:00:56.990" end="00:01:06.500">BECAUSE I LOST IT THE WAY I WANTED TO, BUT THEY GAVE ME THIS HAND, AND I GOT... IT&apos;S AMAZING </p>
<p begin="00:01:06.500" end="00:01:08.435">AND IT&apos;S GETTING BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.435" end="00:01:13.407">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU HAVE ONE THAT CAN... LET&apos;S SAY YOU&apos;RE IN TRAFFIC...</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.115" end="00:01:25.085">&gt;&gt; I USE THE GOOD HAND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.085" end="00:01:25.853">&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.853" end="00:01:27.588">FAIR ENOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.588" end="00:01:30.657">THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN AFGHANISTAN, IT&apos;S AN INCREDIBLE ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.657" end="00:01:32.826">WOULD YOU MIND IF WE JUST WENT THROUGH IT BRIEFLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.826" end="00:01:33.994">&gt;&gt; SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.994" end="00:01:36.630">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU WERE ON DAY MISSION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:37.197">&gt;&gt; YES, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.197" end="00:01:38.465">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND IT WAS A RAID.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.465" end="00:01:40.968">IS THAT UNUSUAL TO BE ON A DAY RAID LIKE THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.968" end="00:01:43.971">&gt;&gt; FOR US IT IS UNUSUAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.971" end="00:01:45.539">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE AN ARMY RANGER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.539" end="00:01:51.245">&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE DON&apos;T NORMALLY DO DAYLIGHT RAIDS, BUT THE NECESSITY TO GET OUT THERE AND </p>
<p begin="00:01:51.245" end="00:01:57.684">GET THIS HIGH VALUE TARGET AND THE TIME OF DAY, WE HAD TO ACT ON IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.684" end="00:02:02.155">&gt;&gt; Jon: IN THE BEGINNING OF IT, YOU ARE WOUNDED EARLY ON IN THE FIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.155" end="00:02:05.692">&gt;&gt; YES, SHOT THROUGH BOTH THIGHS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.692" end="00:02:09.429">I ACTUALLY DIDN&apos;T REALIZE IT UNTIL I GOT TO THE MEDICS LATER,</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.429" end="00:02:11.932">BUT I THOUGHT I WAS JUST SHOT IN THE LEFT LEG.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.932" end="00:02:13.333">IT HAD STUCK IN THERE OR SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.333" end="00:02:16.136">I DIDN&apos;T FEEL IT GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH BOTH LEGS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.136" end="00:02:19.907">SO I WAS RUNNING AROUND DOING THINGS FOR A LITTLE BIT.</p>

<p begin="00:02:28.315" end="00:02:32.085">AND BE VERY PROUD OF YOUR SERVICE AND ALL YOU DID.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.085" end="00:02:38.325">SO IN THIS... NOW, YOU ARE REALLY A VETERAN IN THIS GROUP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.325" end="00:02:39.426">YOU HAVE BEEN TO AFGHANISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.426" end="00:02:41.428">THIS WAS YOUR SIXTH TOUR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.428" end="00:02:43.730">AND YOU HAD TWO TOURS IN IRAQ.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.730" end="00:02:46.233">&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, IT WAS MY FIFTH TOUR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.233" end="00:02:48.368">I&apos;VE BEEN BACK SINCE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.368" end="00:02:51.839">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;VE BEEN BACK TO AFGHANISTAN FOR ANOTHER TOUR SINCE YOU WERE WOUNDED?</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.839" end="00:02:53.407">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.407" end="00:02:55.175">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE LUKE SKYWALKER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.175" end="00:02:56.410">THAT&apos;S WHO YOU ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.410" end="00:02:57.811">THAT&apos;S WHAT THIS IS.</p>

<p begin="00:03:00.047" end="00:03:02.950">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.950" end="00:03:05.619">SO NOW YOU HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN BOTH LEGS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.619" end="00:03:08.822">YOU&apos;VE GOT... THESE ARE YOUNGER FELLAS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.822" end="00:03:10.757">THEY&apos;RE LOOKING TO YOU FOR LEADERSHIP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.757" end="00:03:14.127">ARE YOU STILL FUNCTIONING IN A CAPACITY IN THAT MOMENT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.127" end="00:03:16.063">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.063" end="00:03:18.498">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.498" end="00:03:19.499">IS IT TRAINING?</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.499" end="00:03:23.570">IS IT JUST THERE&apos;S A CERTAIN SOMETHING IN YOU THAT WOULDN&apos;T GIVE UP?</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.570" end="00:03:30.077">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S TRAINING AND IT&apos;S THE FACT THAT WE&apos;RE ALL BROTHERS OUT </p>
<p begin="00:03:30.077" end="00:03:32.980">THERE, AND YOU WOULDN&apos;T... JUST LIKE I WOULDN&apos;T GIVE UP ON ONE </p>
<p begin="00:03:32.980" end="00:03:35.382">OF MY CHILDREN, I WOULDN&apos;T GIVE UP ON MY BROTHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.382" end="00:03:39.152">AND THAT&apos;S THIS WAY I LOOKED AT IT OUT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.152" end="00:03:45.792">AND THE WAY A BIRD TAKES CARE OF IT YOUNG ONE, FEEDS THEM UNTIL THEY CAN GROW AND HOPES THAT </p>
<p begin="00:03:45.792" end="00:03:47.494">THEY BECOME GOOD LEADERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.494" end="00:03:47.961">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.961" end="00:03:49.830">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S JUST MENTORING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.830" end="00:03:53.500">AND I WAS TAKING CARE OF MY OWN THAT DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.500" end="00:03:54.535">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.535" end="00:03:54.935">INCREDIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.935" end="00:04:00.774">AND IN THIS MOMENT, THE ENEMY THROWS A GRENADE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.774" end="00:04:01.608">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.608" end="00:04:07.648">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND TO GIVE PEOPLE A SENSE, DO WE HAVE LIKE A RENDERING OF THE COMPOUND THAT </p>
<p begin="00:04:07.648" end="00:04:09.082">YOU&apos;RE IN THAT YOU&apos;RE FIGHTING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.082" end="00:04:10.350">THIS IS THE COURTYARD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.350" end="00:04:14.388">ARE YOU IN THE INNER COURTYARD AT THIS POINT, THE OUTER COURTYARD BY THE CHICKEN COOP?</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.388" end="00:04:17.691">&gt;&gt; THE INNER COURTYARD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.691" end="00:04:21.495">WE&apos;RE ON THE... WELL, I CAN&apos;T TELL WHICH WAY THAT NORTH ARROW IS POINTING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.495" end="00:04:27.668">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE PURPOSELY MADE THAT TO CONFUSE THE ENTIRE ISSUE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.668" end="00:04:32.806">I THINK IT&apos;S POINTING TOWARDS FLORIDA, BUT I&apos;M NOT SURE WHY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.806" end="00:04:36.610">SO THE ENEMY, WHEN THEY&apos;RE ABLE TO SEND A GRENADE YOUR WAY,</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.610" end="00:04:38.712">YOU&apos;RE IN LOBBING DISTANCE OF THE ENEMY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.712" end="00:04:41.114">AND THESE GUYS ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.114" end="00:04:43.684">YOU&apos;RE LIKE 20 FEET, 30 FEET AWAY FROM THESE GUYS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.684" end="00:04:47.087">&gt;&gt; THE CEILING OF THE BUILDING WAS ONLY ABOUT EIGHT FEET HIGH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.087" end="00:04:52.426">SO IT WAS EASY FOR THEM TO THROW IT OVER I GUESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.426" end="00:04:54.094">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO A GRENADE LANDS,</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.094" end="00:04:58.599">AND I&apos;VE ALWAYS SAID THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD, PEOPLE THAT WHEN A </p>
<p begin="00:04:58.599" end="00:05:03.637">GRENADE LANDS, THEY GO &quot;GRENADE &quot;GRENADE&quot;!</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.637" end="00:05:08.041">AND PEOPLE WHO KEEP THEIR WITS ABOUT THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.041" end="00:05:09.877">IN THAT MOMENT, WHAT&apos;S GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND?</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.877" end="00:05:11.278">&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A SPLIT SECOND.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.278" end="00:05:16.316">I TURNED OVER, LOOKED, I SAW IT AND I KNEW IT WASN&apos;T ONE OF OURS </p>
<p begin="00:05:16.316" end="00:05:18.719">BECAUSE IT WAS THE OLD PINEAPPLE GRENADE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.719" end="00:05:23.323">FIRST THING THAT WENT THROUGH MY MIND IS GET IT OUT OF HERE, GET I AWAY FROM MY GUYS AND ME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.323" end="00:05:24.591">THAT&apos;S WHAT I DID.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.591" end="00:05:30.063">I REACHED FOR IT AND STARTED TO THROW IT AND AS SOON AS I OPENED THE HAND, THAT WAS THE LAST </p>
<p begin="00:05:30.063" end="00:05:32.733">THING THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE HAND DISAPPEARED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.733" end="00:05:35.869">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU AT THAT POINT PASS OUT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.869" end="00:05:36.403">IS THAT...</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.403" end="00:05:37.538">&gt;&gt; NO, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.538" end="00:05:43.677">THEY ASK YOU A LOT OF TIMES IF YOU HAD A CONCUSSION, AND I SAID, HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU </p>
<p begin="00:05:43.677" end="00:05:44.678">HAVE A CONCUSSION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.678" end="00:05:45.946">YOU DON&apos;T HAVE A SENSE OF TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.946" end="00:05:51.251">IF YOU HAVE A CONCUSSION, IT&apos;S DARK OUT WHEN YOU WAKE UP, YOU KNOW YOU HAD A CONCUSSION, BUT </p>
<p begin="00:05:51.251" end="00:05:53.353">IF NOBODY ELSE SEES IT, YOU DON&apos;T KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.353" end="00:06:01.695">BUT I SAT BACK UP FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE SPLIT SECONDS, AND I GRABBED MY ARM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.695" end="00:06:06.733">IT WAS... THE HAND LOOKED LIKE A CIRCULAR SAW HAD TAKEN IT OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.733" end="00:06:09.036">IT WAS FLAT AT THE TOP AND COMPLETELY GONE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.036" end="00:06:11.738">I WAS LIKE... THAT&apos;S THE PART THAT DIDN&apos;T GET ME.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.738" end="00:06:16.877">I GRABBED IT AND I LOOKED AT IT AND I SAID, WHY ISN&apos;T THIS SPRAYING OFF INTO THE WIND LIKE </p>
<p begin="00:06:16.877" end="00:06:19.279">IN HOLLYWOOD MOVIES.</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.251" end="00:06:33.293">IT&apos;S NOT AS GORY AS YOU SAW, NOT QUITE AS SPLURTY AS WHAT YOU&apos;D BEEN LED TO BELIEVE?</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.293" end="00:06:37.631">&gt;&gt; WELL, I FIGURED I HAD... I WAS LIKE, WOW, I GOT A LOT OF TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.631" end="00:06:39.800">IT&apos;S NOT BLEEDING THAT BAD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.800" end="00:06:47.541">BUT I GUESS WITH THE TRAUMATIC INJURY, THE NERVES TUCK BACK AND ALL THE ADRENALINE AND... I </p>
<p begin="00:06:47.541" end="00:06:48.509">DIDN&apos;T FEEL ANY PAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.509" end="00:06:53.981">SO I GRABBED... I WENT TO MY MILITARY TRAINING, GRABBED MY TOURNIQUET AND WAS ABLE TO APPLY </p>
