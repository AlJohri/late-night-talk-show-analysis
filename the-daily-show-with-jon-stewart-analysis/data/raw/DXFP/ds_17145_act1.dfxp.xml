<p begin="00:09:59.299" end="00:10:02.803">&gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT LAST NIGHT WAS ABOUT AND FOR GOOD REASON.</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.803" end="00:10:08.976">REFRAMING THE BROADER DEBATE AS TYRANNICAL DEMOCRATS VERSUS FREEDOM LOVING REPUBLICANS IS </p>
<p begin="00:10:08.976" end="00:10:09.776">ONE REPUBLICANS CAN WIN.</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.776" end="00:10:11.712">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT IT IS NOT THE REAL DEBATE.</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.712" end="00:10:17.017">&gt;&gt; YES, IT IS, THEY HAVE CHANGED IT!.</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.017" end="00:10:20.120">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU ARE SAYING AS LONG AS IT HELPS THEM GET WHAT THEY WANT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO </p>
<p begin="00:10:20.120" end="00:10:20.687">WHATEVER THEY WANT.</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.687" end="00:10:23.657">&gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU A STORY, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.657" end="00:10:28.295">LAST NIGHT I MET A VERY ATTRACTIVE AND VERY DRUNK GIRL.</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.295" end="00:10:33.667">AND LIKE PAUL RYAN, I DELIVERED A SPEECH TO HER ABOUT MY LIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.667" end="00:10:39.773">NOW, AM I A PURPLE HEART RECIPIENT ON, OR AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST?</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.773" end="00:10:40.707">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO.</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.707" end="00:10:41.542">YOU ARE NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.542" end="00:10:43.343">&gt;&gt; TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.343" end="00:10:48.215">BUT DID SHE WAKE UP NEXT TO ME THIS MORNING BEFORE GOING AND TELLING HER FRIENDS THAT SHE </p>
<p begin="00:10:48.215" end="00:10:51.752">JUST HAD SEX WITH A WAR HERO OLYMPIAN?</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.752" end="00:10:54.288">&gt;&gt; YES, JON, YES, SHE DID.</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.288" end="00:10:58.625">AND WHO IS TO SAY THAT HER TRUTH, JON, IS ANY LESS TRUE THAN MINE.</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.625" end="00:11:01.061">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU LIED TO HER TO GET HER INTO BED.</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.061" end="00:11:05.966">&gt;&gt; JON, WHEN SHE SAW ME SHE WAS NOT ATTRACTED TO ME.</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.966" end="00:11:09.837">I INSTANTLY THOUGHT, WE CAN CHANGE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.837" end="00:11:17.244">SO I TOLD HER A SERIES OF FACTS THAT WERE NOT ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE IN ORDER TO REALIZE THE </p>
<p begin="00:11:17.244" end="00:11:25.219">MUCH LARGER TRUTH THAT I WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH HER.</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.219" end="00:11:26.553">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT IS HORRIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.553" end="00:11:28.388">&gt;&gt; WHAT CHOICE DID I HAVE, JON,</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.388" end="00:11:31.592">IF I DIDN&apos;T SAY THAT I WOULDN&apos;T HAVE HAD SEX WITH HER!</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.592" end="00:11:33.193">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU ARE A TERRIBLE,</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.193" end="00:11:33.694">TERRIBLE PERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.694" end="00:11:34.862">&gt;&gt; DEBT USN&apos;T MATTER, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.862" end="00:11:35.796">I CAN CHANGE THAT!</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.796" end="00:11:37.331">&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.331" end="00:11:38.298">JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY.</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.298" end="00:11:39.299">WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK </p>
