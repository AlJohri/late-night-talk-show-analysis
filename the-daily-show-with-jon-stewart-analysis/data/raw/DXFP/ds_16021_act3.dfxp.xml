<p begin="00:00:07.407" end="00:00:10.711">TONIGHT MY GUEST AN ECONOMICS PROFESSOR AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.711" end="00:00:13.180">HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED TRIUMPH OF THE CITY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.180" end="00:00:16.450">HOW OUR GREATEST INVENTION MAKES US RICHER, SMARTER,</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.450" end="00:00:18.118">GREENER, HEALTHIER AND HAPPIER.</p>

<p begin="00:00:27.661" end="00:00:28.462">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.462" end="00:00:32.499">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE BOOK IS TRIUMPH OF THE CITY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.499" end="00:00:37.271">I AM AN ENORMOUS FAN OF CITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.271" end="00:00:45.245">I ENJOY THE FOOD, THE CAMARADERIE, BUT HOW IS IT HEALTHIER IN THE CITY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.245" end="00:00:46.947">HEALTHIER, GREENER,</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.947" end="00:00:47.781">ECONOMICALLY BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.781" end="00:00:49.816">HOW DO ALL THESE THINGS COME TO PASS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.816" end="00:00:54.354">&gt;&gt; WELL IT&apos;S HEALTHIER AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE ARE LESS MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS </p>
<p begin="00:00:54.354" end="00:01:00.961">BECAUSE TAKING A SUBWAY IS JUST A LOT LESS DANGEROUS THAN DRIVING DRUNK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.961" end="00:01:03.597">THERE ARE A LOT FEWER SUICIDES IN NEW YORK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.597" end="00:01:08.068">THE ABSENCE OF GUNS AND PROBABLY THE SOCIAL CONNECTIONS THAT WORK IN CITY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.068" end="00:01:10.270">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID YOU SAY THE ABSENCE OF GUNS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.270" end="00:01:10.704">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.704" end="00:01:12.039">&gt;&gt; Jon: IN NEW YORK CITY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.039" end="00:01:14.908">&gt;&gt; AMONG KEY SUICIDE PRONE POPULATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.908" end="00:01:16.043">&gt;&gt; Jon: I SEE WHAT YOU&apos;RE SAYING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.043" end="00:01:17.444">&gt;&gt; NOT AMONG EVERYONE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.444" end="00:01:18.412">&gt;&gt; Jon: I UNDERSTAND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.412" end="00:01:21.915">&gt;&gt; BUT CITIES ARE JUST AMAZING THINGS BECAUSE THEY PLAY TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:21.915" end="00:01:25.352">MANKIND&apos;S GREATEST ASSET WHICH IS OUR ABILITY TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER FACE TO FACE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.352" end="00:01:29.289">WE COME OUT OF THE WOMB WITH THIS GREAT TALENT OF BEING ABLE TO SOP UP STUFF.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.289" end="00:01:32.392">THAT&apos;S WHAT MAKES CITIES SO SPECIAL AND SO POWERFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.392" end="00:01:34.061">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.061" end="00:01:37.965">I RECENTLY HAD TWO PEOPLE COME OUT OF A WOMB IN MY HOUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.965" end="00:01:42.035">AND I WILL TELL YOU, I WAS THE ONE DOING THE SOPPING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.035" end="00:01:45.272">THEY SEEMED, IF I MAY,</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.272" end="00:01:45.639">SOPLESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.639" end="00:01:46.206">&gt;&gt; INDEED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.206" end="00:01:53.013">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT IS THE IDEA THAT THE PROXIMITY IS WHAT FEEDS THE ENERGY AND DOES IT ONLY </p>
<p begin="00:01:53.013" end="00:01:54.147">WORK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.147" end="00:01:58.752">&gt;&gt; NO IT DOESN&apos;T ONLY WORK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT CITIES HAVE PARTICULAR ASSETS LIKE THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:58.752" end="00:02:02.656">ABILITY TO MEET OTHER SINGLE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY VALUE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.656" end="00:02:03.657">IT WORKS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.657" end="00:02:07.661">IT&apos;S JUST A SUPER CHARGING OF THIS BASIC HUMAN ABILITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.661" end="00:02:12.366">IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE FACEBOOK ARE REMARKABLY MAKING CITIES MORE NOT LESS IMPORTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.366" end="00:02:13.700">LOOK AT EGYPT AND CAIRO,</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.700" end="00:02:14.768">RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.768" end="00:02:18.172">IT&apos;S CALLED A FACEBOOK REVOLUTION BUT IT&apos;S ONLY HAPPENING IN CITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.172" end="00:02:23.577">IT&apos;S NOT LIKE YOU CAN BLOCK MUBARAK FROM YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE AND THAT CAUSES A </p>
<p begin="00:02:23.577" end="00:02:25.212">TOPPLING OF THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.212" end="00:02:27.114">YOU HAVE TO BE THERE IN THE CITY MAKING SOMETHING HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.114" end="00:02:28.815">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET ME SAY THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.815" end="00:02:30.617">IT SEEMS LIKE YOU&apos;RE UPSET AT ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.617" end="00:02:32.686">I FEEL LIKE I HAVEN&apos;T DONE ANYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.686" end="00:02:33.754">&gt;&gt; NO, YOU HAVEN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.754" end="00:02:37.991">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE THING ABOUT CITIES IS THAT THOUGH WHAT ABOUT DISEASE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.991" end="00:02:42.296">BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE THE CLOSER THE PROXIMITY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.296" end="00:02:43.764">BED BUGS, BUBONIC PLAGUE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.764" end="00:02:53.841">THESE ARE... THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT SEEM TO MAKE CITIES... YOU WRITE THAT THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:53.841" end="00:02:55.609">PEOPLE DIE LATER IN CITIES,</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.609" end="00:02:58.579">THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE LONGER IN CITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.579" end="00:02:59.780">THAT SEEMS STUNNING TO ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.780" end="00:03:01.181">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S AMAZING ACHIEVEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.181" end="00:03:06.153">A BOY BEING BORN IN NEW YORK 110 YEARS AGO COULD EXPECT TO LIVE SEVEN YEARS LESS THAN A </p>
<p begin="00:03:06.153" end="00:03:07.554">BOY BORN SOMEWHERE ELSE IN AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.554" end="00:03:11.992">NOW LIFE EXPECT TAES IS TWO YEARS LONGER IN NEW YORK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.992" end="00:03:14.928">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT HAS CAUSED THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.928" end="00:03:17.431">JUST PROXIMITY TO HOSPITALS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.431" end="00:03:19.233">&gt;&gt; NO, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.233" end="00:03:21.168">LIFESTYLE, WALKING AND GETTING CLEAN WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.168" end="00:03:25.272">THE MOST IMPORTANT THING CITY GOVERNMENTS DO IS THEY ACTUALLY MAKE SURE YOU CAN </p>
<p begin="00:03:25.272" end="00:03:26.507">DRINK THE WATER AND NOT DIE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.507" end="00:03:29.843">THAT&apos;S A CRITICAL THING THAT CITIES NEED TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.843" end="00:03:32.212">THIS REQUIRES HUGE INVESTMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.212" end="00:03:35.148">A AQUADUCT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.148" end="00:03:39.386">THE START OF THE 20th CENTURY CITY GOVERNMENTS WERE SPENDING MORE ON WATER THAN THE FEDERAL </p>
<p begin="00:03:39.386" end="00:03:42.956">GOVERNMENT SPENT ON ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE ARMY AND THE POST OFFICE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.956" end="00:03:45.325">MASSIVE INVESTMENT IN THIS STUFF TO MAKE CITIES HEALTHY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.325" end="00:03:48.562">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT CITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.562" end="00:03:50.264">FOR SUBURBS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN,</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.264" end="00:03:54.568">YOU KNOW, EMBEDDED IN I THINK THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY THAT THE IDEA IS YOU COME TO A CITY </p>
<p begin="00:03:54.568" end="00:03:56.837">AS AN IMPOVERISHED IMMIGRANT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.837" end="00:04:03.277">YOU WORK VERY HARD SO THAT YOUR CHILDREN CAN MOVE TO NEW JERSEY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.277" end="00:04:09.550">AND LIVE A SUB URBAN LIFESTYLE WHERE PEOPLE DON&apos;T TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE AND THE TV </p>
<p begin="00:04:09.550" end="00:04:13.921">REPLACES THESE FACE-TO-FACE ENCOUNTERS THAT YOU&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.921" end="00:04:17.925">ISN&apos;T THAT THE DREAM?</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.925" end="00:04:22.729">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S THE MAJOR REASON I WROTE THIS BOOK IS I REALLY HOPED WE COULD MOVE BEYOND </p>
<p begin="00:04:22.729" end="00:04:27.201">THINKING THAT THE ONLY AMERICAN DREAM IS A WHITE PICKET FENCE IN THE SUBURBS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.201" end="00:04:32.206">IF THE REST WAS AMERICA WAS AS PRODUCTIVE AS THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA OUR G.D.P.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.206" end="00:04:34.641">PER CAPITA WOULD GO UP 43%.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.641" end="00:04:37.511">THESE ARE THE PLACES FOR COMPETITION, INNOVATION,</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.511" end="00:04:38.212">CHANGE HAPPENS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.212" end="00:04:39.680">THESE ARE GREAT PLACES FOR AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:42.182">WE DON&apos;T NEED ANTI-URBAN POLICY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.182" end="00:04:44.451">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO WE HAVE ANTI-URBAN POLICY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.451" end="00:04:45.152">&gt;&gt; SURE WE DO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.152" end="00:04:46.119">&gt;&gt; Jon: LIKE WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.119" end="00:04:48.755">&gt;&gt; THE HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.755" end="00:04:51.658">WE MAKE A NETISH OUT OF HOME OWNERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.658" end="00:04:54.328">PEOPLE IN NEW YORK TEND TO RENT FOR GOOD REASONS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.328" end="00:04:58.332">HAVING A LOT OF OWNERS UNDER ONE ROOF IS A NIGHTMARE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.332" end="00:04:59.600">&gt;&gt; Jon: ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:02.102">&gt;&gt; YOU SUBSIDIZE HOME OWNERSHIP.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.102" end="00:05:04.771">YOU PUSH GUYS OUT INTO SUBURBS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.771" end="00:05:06.974">WE HAVE A TRANSPORTATION POLICY, RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.974" end="00:05:08.976">WE INVESTED HEAVILY IN HIGHWAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.976" end="00:05:14.882">WE&apos;RE STILL THROWING MONEY AT SUBURBS... AT HIGHWAYS IN LOW DENSITY AREAS.</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.156" end="00:05:25.392">&gt;&gt; Jon: SUBURBS ARE DRAGGING US DOWN.</p>
