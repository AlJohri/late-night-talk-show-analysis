<p begin="00:00:44.211" end="00:00:47.714">TAKEN CONTROL OF MANY OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.714" end="00:00:49.483">IS THAT CORRECT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.483" end="00:00:52.653">&gt;&gt; 21 FLIPD FROM DEMOCRAT TO REPUBLICAN IN THE NOVEMBER 2 ELECTIONS.</p>

<p begin="00:03:18.232" end="00:03:22.769">&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO START BY ELIMINATING THAT DEFICIT WOULD BE A NICE WAY TO START.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.769" end="00:03:28.242">SECONDLY IT&apos;S DONATION NOT TAX DOLLARS TO SO PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY GIVE, A LITTLE DIFFERENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.242" end="00:03:29.376">BUT IT&apos;S A LEGITIMATE POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.376" end="00:03:33.514">WE&apos;VE GOT TO ELIMINATE THAT DEBT AND THAT&apos;S WHY I LIKE THAT JOKE </p>
<p begin="00:03:33.514" end="00:03:37.017">THAT THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN BEING THE R.N.C. CHAIRMAN IS BEING THE FORMER R.N.C. CHAIRMAN </p>
