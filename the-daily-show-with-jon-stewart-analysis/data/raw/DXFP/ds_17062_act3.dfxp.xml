<p begin="00:00:06.874" end="00:00:10.944">MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS A COLUMNIST FOR THE ECONOMIC BLOG OF THE &quot;NEW YORK TIMES.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:00:10.944" end="00:00:15.382">HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED, &quot;THE BENEFIT AND THE BURDEN, TAX REFORM WHY WE NEED IT AND WHAT </p>
<p begin="00:00:15.382" end="00:00:19.319">IT WILL TAKE.&quot; PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW,</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.166" end="00:00:34.902">DWRIEWR HERE ON A RED-LETTER DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.902" end="00:00:39.072">THE PRESIDENT OAT VERY DAY YOU&apos;RE CALLING FOR TAX REFORM HAS ANNOUNCED HE WOULD LIKE TO </p>
<p begin="00:00:39.072" end="00:00:43.810">CUT THE CORPORATE TAX RATE IN THIS COUNTRY FROM 35% TO 28%,</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.810" end="00:00:50.083">CLOSE SOME LOOPHOLES AND DO A FEE FOR ANY COMPANY IN AMERICA THAT DOES THEIR BUSINESS OVERSEAS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.083" end="00:00:53.253">WHAT&apos;S YOUR FEELING ABOUT THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.253" end="00:00:55.389">&gt;&gt; WELL, IT SOUNDS, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.389" end="00:00:59.526">LIKE A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, BUT I NOTICED, ALSO,</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.526" end="00:01:03.730">ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO IS HAVE AN EXTRA-SPECIAL LOW RATE OF 25% </p>
<p begin="00:01:03.730" end="00:01:05.632">JUST FOR MANUFACTURING COMPANIES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.632" end="00:01:11.238">AND I THINK THAT THAT MOVES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF TRYING TO TREAT ALL BUSINESSES EQUALLY,</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.238" end="00:01:14.241">AND MOVES US IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF REFORM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.241" end="00:01:21.148">&gt;&gt; Jon:  NOW YOU WORKED WITH RONALD REAGAN DURING THE DAYS OF HIS HEYDAY, AND YOU SAY-- WHAT </p>
<p begin="00:01:21.148" end="00:01:24.551">DO YOU, REAGAN WOULD DO THISN THIS SITUATION?</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.551" end="00:01:26.620">IN YOUR MIND WHAT, DOES HE DO IN THIS SITUATION?</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.620" end="00:01:30.290">&gt;&gt; WELL, WE KNOW WHAT RONALD REAGAN DID BECAUSE HE DID IT IN 1986.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.290" end="00:01:34.962">HE HAD A BIG STUDY DONE BY THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND THEY MADE A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS </p>
<p begin="00:01:34.962" end="00:01:40.133">AND SENT THEM TO CAPITOL HILL AND THEY DISCUSSED IT AND THEY ENDED UP LOWERING THE TOP TAX </p>
<p begin="00:01:40.133" end="00:01:46.707">RATE FROM 50% TO 28% BUT AMONG OTHER THINGS HE RAISED THE CAPITAL GAINS RATE FROM 20% TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:46.707" end="00:01:52.212">28% BECAUSE RONALD REAGAN SAID HE OUGHT TO TREAT CAPITAL GAINS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.212" end="00:01:57.184">INCOME FROM CAPITAL, THE SAME AS LABOR, AND I THINK THAT&apos;S AN IDEA THAT IS REALLY PRETTY OFF </p>
<p begin="00:01:57.184" end="00:01:58.352">THE TABLE TODAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.352" end="00:02:04.691">&gt;&gt; Jon:  SO WOULD RONALD REAGAN BE TOO LIBERAL FOR TODAY&apos;S REPUBLICAN PARTY IN </p>
<p begin="00:02:04.691" end="00:02:05.359">TERMS OF FINANCIAL POLICY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.359" end="00:02:07.828">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S ANY QUESTIONS QE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.828" end="00:02:12.065">EVERYBODY FORGETS ALTHOUGH HE CUT TAXES HIS FIRST YEAR HE RAISE THE THEM ALMOST EVERY </p>
<p begin="00:02:12.065" end="00:02:14.701">OTHER YEAR OF HIS PRESIDENCY, 11 DIFFERENT TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.701" end="00:02:18.939">&gt;&gt; Jon:  BECAUSE HE WAS-- AND I THINK WE BOAST ADMIT NOW-- A COMMUNIST ( LAUGHTER ) </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.939" end="00:02:24.077">I MEAN, WE WOULD BOTH AGREE-- HOW IS IT THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES TO TAX REFORM </p>
<p begin="00:02:24.077" end="00:02:28.715">IN THIS COUNTRY IS A GROUP CALLED AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM?</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.715" end="00:02:32.085">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.085" end="00:02:33.153">GLOAN I KNOW!</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.153" end="00:02:37.558">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S RUN BY A FRIEND OF MINE NAMED GROVER NORQUIST, AND THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:37.558" end="00:02:40.694">THING IS IT DOESN&apos;T DO ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH TAX REFORM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.694" end="00:02:46.900">THEY SUPPORT EVERY SINGLE SPECIAL TAX DEAL THAT ANYBODY EVER PROPOSES, ESPECIALLY IF </p>
<p begin="00:02:46.900" end="00:02:49.703">YOU&apos;RE A REPUBLICAN, SLOPGZ IT LOWERS TAXES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.703" end="00:02:51.538">THEY SAY THAT&apos;S OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.538" end="00:02:55.542">LOOPHOLES, ANYTHING THAT&apos;S A LOOPHOLE IS FINE WITH THEM, AS LONG AS IT LOWERS TAXES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.542" end="00:03:01.215">BUT ONCE THE LOOPHOLE GETS PUT IN, YOU CANNOT EVER TAKE IT OUT AGAIN BECAUSE THAT&apos;S A TAX INCREASE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.215" end="00:03:03.050">I THINK THIS IS JUST LUDICROUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.050" end="00:03:07.654">&gt;&gt; Jon:  AND THE RHETORIC IS SO COMPETING, THERE&apos;S THIS RHETORIC OF WE HAVE A TERRIBLE </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.654" end="00:03:10.090">DEBT AND DEFICIT PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.090" end="00:03:13.961">IT IS UNMESSENGERRABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.961" end="00:03:14.394">UNMANAGEABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.394" end="00:03:17.898">IT HAS PUT OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN&apos;S CHILDREN INTO SLAVERY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.898" end="00:03:24.137">THEY WILL BE STARRING IN THE INDIANA JONES MOVIE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.137" end="00:03:28.408">AND, YET, THE TAX BITE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE LOWEST IT&apos;S BEEN,</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.408" end="00:03:32.913">ESPECIALLY FOR THE UPPER INCOME GROUPS, SINCE THE 1950s.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.913" end="00:03:34.348">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S EXACTLY CORRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.348" end="00:03:40.087">TAXES AS AWE SHARE OF THE G.D.P., HAVE NOT BEEN-- ARE AT THE LOEFT THEY&apos;VE BEEN IN MY </p>

<p begin="00:03:44.725" end="00:03:46.093">STOP IT!</p>

<p begin="00:03:57.371" end="00:04:03.043">BESIDES FROM BEING THE WORST PLOT OF A &quot;WIZARD OF OZ&quot; SPIN-OFF THAT I&apos;VE EVER HEARD,</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.043" end="00:04:08.682">WHAT IS THE LIKE HOOD-- LIKELIHOOD THAT DEMOCRATS WILL GAIN COURAGE AND REPUBLICANS </p>
