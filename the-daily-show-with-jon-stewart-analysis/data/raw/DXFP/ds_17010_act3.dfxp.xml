<p begin="00:00:26.360" end="00:00:31.532">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE BOOK IS &quot;STEVE JOBS&quot; HOW DIFFICULT IS IT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.532" end="00:00:36.837">YOU ARE WRITING A BIOGRAPHY FOR SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW IS ILL -- </p>
<p begin="00:00:36.837" end="00:00:37.171">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.171" end="00:00:44.278">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE ON THE RECORD BUT HOW DO YOU REMINE OBJECTIVE?</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.278" end="00:00:45.546">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S REALLY HARD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.546" end="00:00:51.552">I WAS HOPING WHEN I LAST TALKED TO HIM A MONTH OR SO BEFORE HE DIED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.552" end="00:00:55.122">HE SAID I&apos;LL READ IT IN A YEAR OR SO.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.122" end="00:00:59.426">HE SAID I DON&apos;T WANT TO READ WHIT IT COMES OUT BECAUSE IT WILL ANNOY ME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.426" end="00:01:03.964">HE HAS A WAY OF MAGICAL THINKING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.964" end="00:01:07.534">OH, GREAT, HE WILL BE AROUND A YEAR AND HE WILL BITE MY HEAD OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.534" end="00:01:08.869">YOU KEEP THAT IN MIND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.869" end="00:01:13.841">I GOT EMOTIONALLY, MORE THAN YOU NORMALLY DO AS A JOURNALIST INVOLVED IN THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.841" end="00:01:17.744">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU TALK ABOUT THE BOOK AND PEOPLE INTERVIEWED ABOUT HIS REALITY DISTORTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.744" end="00:01:18.278">&gt;&gt; TOTALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.278" end="00:01:24.518">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT HE CREATES THIS AURA OF YOU CAN -- HE CONVINCES HIMSELF AND OTHER PEOPLE THEY </p>
<p begin="00:01:24.518" end="00:01:28.121">CAN ACCOMPLISH THINGS THAT THEY DID NOT THINK WERE POSSIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.121" end="00:01:31.491">&gt;&gt; HE BASICALLY TELLS PEOPLE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.491" end="00:01:32.526">YOU CAN DO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.526" end="00:01:36.129">THIS YOU CAN CODE THIS IN FOUR DAYS, NOT FOUR MONTHS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.129" end="00:01:40.100">THEY CALLED IT THE REALITY DISTORTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.100" end="00:01:44.104">THIS IS IN THE OLD DAYS OF APPLE DOING THE FIRST MAC.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.104" end="00:01:50.110">THE ODE THING ABOUT STEVE WOZNIAK AND OTHERS SAY HE ENDED UPPING BEING RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.110" end="00:01:57.384">WOE PUSH PEOPLE TO DO INSANELY GREAT THINGS SIMPLY BY MAKING THEM BELIEVE THEY COULD DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.384" end="00:02:02.256">&gt;&gt; Jon: A REALLY INTERESTING THING IN THE BOOK IS OUR OFTEN STEVE JOBS CRIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.256" end="00:02:05.058">&gt;&gt; HE IS AWESOMELY EMOTIONAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.058" end="00:02:06.860">THIS WAS THE BIGGEST SURPRISE TO ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.860" end="00:02:08.395">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE IS A WEEPER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.395" end="00:02:13.300">&gt;&gt; I WAS WITH HIM ONCE AND HE WAS TELLING ME -- I DON&apos;T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THE THINK </p>
<p begin="00:02:13.300" end="00:02:18.505">DIFFERENT ADS, HERE IS THE CRAZY ONES, THE PEOPLE WHO CAN CHANGE THE WORLD AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.505" end="00:02:20.440">CRAZY ENOUGH TO THINK THEY CAN CHANGE THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.440" end="00:02:29.650">&gt;&gt; Jon: I REMEMBER THERE WAS AN AD WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS A PC AND THE OTHER WAS A MAC.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.650" end="00:02:33.287">THE PC WAS A TERRIBLY UNLIKABLE FELLOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.287" end="00:02:33.620">GOOD AD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.620" end="00:02:34.855">&gt;&gt; HE IS READING ME THAT SCRIPT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.855" end="00:02:36.623">I LOOKED UP AND HE IS CRYING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.623" end="00:02:40.694">HE SAID EXCUSE ME BUT I JUST GET VERY EMOTIONAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.694" end="00:02:47.434">THIS IS -- WHEN I&apos;M IN THE HUSBANDS OF ARTISTIC PURITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.434" end="00:02:49.203">HE CONNECTS EMOTION TO TECHNOLOGY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.203" end="00:02:55.209">THIS IS WHY THE OUTPOURING OF GRIEF AT HIS DEATH WAS BEYOND WHAT MOST WOULD HAVE EXPECTED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.209" end="00:02:59.213">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW MUCH OF THAT -- IN THE BOOK YOU GET THE SENSE AT TIMES FROM SOME OF THE PEOPLE </p>
<p begin="00:02:59.213" end="00:03:01.748">THAT THE CRYING OF A MANIPULATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.748" end="00:03:09.223">THAT IS THE -- PART OF WHAT HE DID WAS HE TRIED TO CONTROL -- HE HAD THE ZEN STARE HE WOULD </p>
<p begin="00:03:09.223" end="00:03:12.793">USE ON PEOPLE OR THE CRY -- YOU GET THE SENSE THAT THEY WEREN&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:03:12.793" end="00:03:16.730">SURE SOMETIMES IF HE WAS TRYING TO MANIPULATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.730" end="00:03:19.466">&gt;&gt; THE ZEN STARE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.466" end="00:03:22.169">HE COULD STARE WITHOUT BLINKING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.169" end="00:03:24.838">THAT WAS REALLY POWERFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.838" end="00:03:31.645">I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE EMOTIONALISM CAME IF A DEEP PASSION FOR ARTISTIC THINGSISM </p>
<p begin="00:03:31.645" end="00:03:34.915">NEVER FELT IT WAS MANIPULATE TISM MAYBE I&apos;M WRONG.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.915" end="00:03:38.385">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE REALITY DISTORTION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.385" end="00:03:40.187">THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.187" end="00:03:40.454">OF.</p>

<p begin="00:03:47.761" end="00:03:48.896">SO MANY DIFFERENT INFLUENCES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.896" end="00:03:57.337">I WONDER DID YOU EVER DECONSTRUCT IT AND THINK IF THIS HASN&apos;T HAVE HAPPENED AND HE </p>
<p begin="00:03:57.337" end="00:04:05.212">HADN&apos;T IMBURSED HIMSELF IN BUDDHISM AND MET WOZNIAK WOULD THIS HAVE COME TOGETHER?</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.212" end="00:04:11.251">IT&apos;S AMAZING THE COINCIDENCES THAT COME TOGETHER INCLUDING THE BIG CONFLEWENCE WHICH IS HIS </p>
<p begin="00:04:11.251" end="00:04:18.058">LIFE AND THE SOUL OF APPLE WHICH IS THE COUNTER CULTURE, YOU KNOW, ALTERNATIVE, HIPPY-STILL </p>
<p begin="00:04:18.058" end="00:04:25.832">OF THE 60s AND EARLY 70s AND THEN THE ELECTRONIC GEEKY BUSINESS LET&apos;S DO A START UP </p>
<p begin="00:04:25.832" end="00:04:30.971">SILICON VALLEY STUFF ALL COME TOGETHER IN STEVE JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.971" end="00:04:37.377">THAT IS THE ARC OF IT THE PASSION FOR THE ROW MANTISM THAT GETS SERIOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.377" end="00:04:40.247">WEIRD COINCIDENCES LIKE HIS BIRTH FATHER GIVING HIM UP.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.247" end="00:04:46.720">HE NEVER FOUND HIM AND FINALLY WITH THE HELP OF HIS SISTER MONA SIMPSON HE TRACKS DOWN THE BIRTH </p>

<p begin="00:04:56.496" end="00:05:03.637">I DON&apos;T KNOW THERE&apos;S A CERTAIN BUDDHIST CONFLEWENCE OR COINCIDENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.637" end="00:05:10.944">&gt;&gt; Jon: EVEN HIS ADOPTED FATHER S A MEK CANTIC BUT -- MECHANIC BUT SOMEBODY HE LEARNED </p>

<p begin="00:05:15.082" end="00:05:21.054">WHAT JOBS BROUGHT THAT WOZNIAK DIDN&apos;T HAVE WAS A SENSE TO MAKE IT WORK AS A BUSINESS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.054" end="00:05:23.657">A PRACTICAL AND PRAGMATIC OPERATION.</p>
