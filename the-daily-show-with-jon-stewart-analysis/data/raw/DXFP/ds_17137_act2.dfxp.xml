<p begin="00:00:26.960" end="00:00:30.998">THE INTERNET WAS ABUZZ ABOUT WHETHER HE WAS AROUSED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.998" end="00:00:37.604">I PERSONALLY BELIEVE-- AND I STAND BY THIS-- THAT AN EEL JUMPED INTO THE BOAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.604" end="00:00:45.312">DESPERATE FOR WARMTH, THE EEL BURROWED INTO THAT MAN&apos;S SHORTS.</p>

<p begin="00:01:10.070" end="00:01:13.841">WHICH MAKES ME SAD, FOR SOME REASON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.841" end="00:01:15.776">IS RUMLE TELLING THE TRUTH?</p>

<p begin="00:01:40.501" end="00:01:44.104">IT&apos;S A PARADOX OF PHYSICS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.104" end="00:01:48.008">CAN A PENIS BE BOTH ERECT AND NOT ERECT AT THE SAME TIME?</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.008" end="00:01:51.979">&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHAT ARE YOU FINDING THE SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTS FOR EITHER SIDE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.979" end="00:01:54.281">&gt;&gt; THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.281" end="00:02:00.053">ONE POSTULATES THAT THE PENIS MUST BE ERECT DUE TO ITS UPWARD POINTING NATURE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.053" end="00:02:03.824">UP AND TO THE LEFT, UP AND TO THE LEFT.</p>

<p begin="00:02:21.975" end="00:02:23.810">BUT BRONZE, JON?</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.810" end="00:02:27.080">&gt;&gt; Jon:  IT CAN&apos;T BE THE ONLY FACTOR CAUSING HIS ERECTION?</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.080" end="00:02:28.982">&gt;&gt; AAH!</p>
