<p begin="00:00:19.953" end="00:00:21.355">&gt;&gt; Jon: BECAUSE THAT WAS SCHEDULED.</p>

<p begin="00:00:27.828" end="00:00:37.905">WE OF COURSE OBTAINED AN ADVANCE COPY AND-- AS A PUBLIC SERVICE, ARE ABLE TO AIR IT FOR YOU NOW.</p>

<p begin="00:00:42.242" end="00:00:44.111">&gt;&gt; STOCK MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD PLUNGE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.111" end="00:00:46.146">&gt;&gt; SEVERAL DOMINOES HAVE FALLEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.146" end="00:00:47.848">&gt;&gt; THE DO YOU PLUNGED ANOTHER 508 POINTS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.848" end="00:00:50.450">&gt;&gt; WHO WILL LEAD US OUT OF THIS CRISIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.450" end="00:00:56.323">&gt;&gt; UNTIL AN AUDACIOUS YOUNG MAN NAMED BARAK HUSSEIN OBAMA POINTED AMERICA TO A </p>
<p begin="00:00:56.323" end="00:00:57.658">NEWERA OF HOPE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.658" end="00:00:59.193">AND NOW FOUR YEARS LATER,</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.193" end="00:01:01.161">THAT MAN CAN PROUDLY SAY -- </p>
<p begin="00:01:01.161" end="00:01:11.438">&gt;&gt; IT COULD HAVE BEEN EVEN WORSE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.438" end="00:01:14.541">&gt;&gt; AS OBAMA TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE THE ECONOMY WAS IN FREEFALL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.541" end="00:01:18.612">SO HE QUICKLY ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF FRESH ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EXPERTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.612" end="00:01:22.749">ONE OF WHOM ACTUALLY COULDN&apos;T EVEN BE LINKED IN ANYWAY TO THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.749" end="00:01:26.854">THEY PUT IN PLACE AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE THAT DEFINITELY DIDN&apos;T RUIN </p>
<p begin="00:01:26.854" end="00:01:30.924">THE COUNTRY, AND THE RESULTS SPOKE FOR THEMSELVES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.924" end="00:01:33.827">&gt;&gt; PEOPLE SAY WELL, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.827" end="00:01:35.696">THE STOCK MARKET DIDN&apos;T FULLY RECOVER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.696" end="00:01:40.801">YEAH, BUT IT&apos;S RECOVERED MORE THAN PEOPLE EXPECTED LAST YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.801" end="00:01:44.938">THINGS ARE STILL TOUGH, THEY JUST AREN&apos;T AS BAD AS THEY COULD HAVE BEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.938" end="00:01:46.940">UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL AT 9.6,</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.940" end="00:01:49.977">YES, BUT IT&apos;S NOT 12 OR 13.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.977" end="00:01:51.011">OR 15.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.011" end="00:01:53.113">&gt;&gt; OR 19, OR 80.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.113" end="00:01:58.485">THERE&apos;S NO LIMIT TO HOW HIGH NUMBERS CAN GO, BY HELPING TO MAKE THINGS LESS BAD, THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:58.485" end="00:02:01.054">RECOVERY ACT IS HELPING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.054" end="00:02:03.490">&gt;&gt; IT WAS THE OBAMA DOCTRINE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.490" end="00:02:08.061">THAT LESS BAD WAS BETTER THAN MORE BAD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.061" end="00:02:14.201">AND SO THE PRESIDENT WOULD USE THE POWER OF HIS OFFICE TO LISTEN BADNESS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.201" end="00:02:18.539">SO JUST AS AMERICA BEGAN TO THINK A LITTLE SLOWER,</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.539" end="00:02:19.973">DISASTER STRUCK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.973" end="00:02:23.710">OIL SPILLING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO, WILDFIRES ACROSS THE WEST AND AS EVERYONE </p>
<p begin="00:02:23.710" end="00:02:27.114">COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS TAKING WAY LONGER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE TO PLUG A HOLE </p>
<p begin="00:02:27.114" end="00:02:31.618">BECAUSE THEY DECIDED FOR SOME REASON TO SHOOT GARBAGE INTO IT, NOBODY MENTIONED </p>
<p begin="00:02:31.618" end="00:02:36.823">THE NEARLY 60% OF THE COUNTRY THAT WASN&apos;T BURNING OR COVERED IN OIL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.823" end="00:02:39.426">THAT&apos;S A SOLID D MINUS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.426" end="00:02:42.496">BUT THE CRITICS COULD NOT BE SATISFIED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.496" end="00:02:45.532">&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT HAS PROMISED TO CLOSE GUANTANAMO,</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.532" end="00:02:46.567">THAT DIDN&apos;T HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.567" end="00:02:50.737">&gt;&gt; OKAY, HE DIDN&apos;T CLOSE GUANTANAMO, BUT IT DIDN&apos;T GET ANY BIGGER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.737" end="00:02:52.372">SO IT&apos;S IN REMISSION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.372" end="00:02:54.875">&gt;&gt; HE ALSO PROMISED TO CHANGE THE TONE IN WASHINGTON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.875" end="00:02:57.878">&gt;&gt; HOW IMPORTANT IS TONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.878" end="00:03:01.114">WHEN DID YOU EVER HEAR FEBRUARY SAY THIS PLACE HAS GREAT TONE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.114" end="00:03:05.786">&gt;&gt; WHEN I SEE THE PRESIDENT CLAIMING CREDIT WITH THE KILLING OF O BIN LADEN AND </p>
<p begin="00:03:05.786" end="00:03:08.856">SAID HE WASN&apos;T GOING TO BE GLOATING AND NOW HE WANTS THIS VICTORY LAP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.856" end="00:03:09.857">&gt;&gt; OKAY, I&apos;M SORRY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.857" end="00:03:11.558">I HAVE TO STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.558" end="00:03:14.294">NOW YOU ARE GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WAY HE KILLED BIN LADEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.294" end="00:03:18.732">COME ON, YOU GOT A BETTER WAY TO SHOOT AN EVIL TERRORIST IN THE FACE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.732" end="00:03:20.767">BECAUSE TO ME, SEEMS LIKE HE KIND OF NAILED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.767" end="00:03:22.135">LOOK WHO HE IS WORKING WITH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.135" end="00:03:25.372">&gt;&gt; OUR TOP POLITICAL PRIORITY OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS SHOULD BE TO DENY </p>
<p begin="00:03:25.372" end="00:03:26.940">PRESIDENT OBAMA A SECOND TERM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.940" end="00:03:30.978">&gt;&gt; AN EVEN WITH A TURTLE MAN STANDING IN HIS WAY, LOOK WHAT HE STILL GOT DONE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.978" end="00:03:34.081">&gt;&gt; DID WE GET UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.081" end="00:03:34.715">NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.715" end="00:03:41.955">BUT THE THING WE DID GET WITH THE INSURANCE POOL FOR COVERAGE OF,-- I DON&apos;T KNOW </p>
<p begin="00:03:41.955" end="00:03:45.325">THE DETAILS, THE POINT IS IT&apos;S BETTER THAN CANCER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.325" end="00:03:48.562">AND ON TOP OF THAT, THINK OF THE STUFF THAT DIDN&apos;T HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.562" end="00:03:52.533">&gt;&gt; THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER SIZED ASTEROID HAS MISSED THE EARTH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.533" end="00:03:54.501">&gt;&gt; WE WERE ALMOST HIT BY A </p>

<p begin="00:04:02.743" end="00:04:08.882">FOR A BLACK PRESIDENT TO NOT GET HIT BY AN ASTEROID, THAT IS THE STUFF.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.882" end="00:04:11.285">LOOK, ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO,</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.285" end="00:04:12.619">OF COURSE NOT.</p>
