<p begin="00:00:07.374" end="00:00:11.111">WE&apos;VE BEEN TALKING A LOT LATELY ABOUT THE POOR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.111" end="00:00:14.181">WHAT KIND OF A SCAM ARE THEY RUNNING ON THEM?</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.181" end="00:00:20.020">HOW CAN WE LET THEM KNOW THAT THIS INCREDIBLY WATERED DOWN GRAPHY TRAIN IS COMING TO AN END.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.020" end="00:00:24.358">THE ANSWER AS ALWAYS IS IN FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.358" end="00:00:26.159">AASIF MANDVI HAS MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.159" end="00:00:26.827">&gt;&gt; Reporter: POOR PEOPLE,</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.827" end="00:00:29.229">THEY SPEND THEIR DAYS PROTECTED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.229" end="00:00:37.704">LUXOR YATING IN THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET, BUT WHO WILL PROTECT US FROM THESE DRUG ADELED MOOCHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.704" end="00:00:41.475">FORTUNATELY SOME COURAGEOUS POLITICIANS IN FLORIDA HAVE ANSWERED THE CALL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.475" end="00:00:45.879">&gt;&gt; FLORIDA GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT JUST SIGNED A LAW THAT WELFARE RECIPIENTS SHOULD </p>
<p begin="00:00:45.879" end="00:00:50.050">GET DRUG TESTS BEFORE THEY GET THEIR HANDS ON THAT TAXPAYER FUNDED WELFARE CHECK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.050" end="00:00:55.489">&gt;&gt; THE STUDIES SHOW THAT PEOPLE ON WELFARE ARE USING DRUGS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE POPULATION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.489" end="00:00:59.326">&gt;&gt; Reporter: AND THAT DAMNING EVIDENCE HELPED THE LAW PASS BY A 2-1 MARGIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.326" end="00:01:04.298">WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF PEOPLE LIKE REPRESENTATIVES SCOTT PLAQUEIN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.298" end="00:01:09.269">&gt;&gt; I THINK IN ANY LAW THAT WE PASS THE FIRST THING SHOULD BE DO NO HARM, BY </p>
<p begin="00:01:09.269" end="00:01:13.073">GIVING CASH TO SOMEBODY THAT HAS A DRUG HABIT, WE&apos;RE DOING HARM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.073" end="00:01:15.776">&gt;&gt; Reporter: WE KNOW HOW MUCH POOR PEOPLE LOVE DRUGS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.776" end="00:01:18.846">&gt;&gt; WELL, I WOULDN&apos;T SAY THAT POOR PEOPLE LOVE DRUGS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.846" end="00:01:19.179">AASIF.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.179" end="00:01:23.083">BUT IF WE ARE GIVING YOU MONEY, WE&apos;RE JUST ASKING YOU TO TAKE THIS TEST.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.083" end="00:01:27.287">&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT THE INSINUATION BY LEGISLATORS THAT ALL POOR PEOPLE ARE ON </p>
<p begin="00:01:27.287" end="00:01:30.757">DRUGS DOESN&apos;T SIT WELL WITH SOME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.757" end="00:01:33.493">&gt;&gt; I REFUSE TO TAKE THE DRUG TEST.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.493" end="00:01:39.600">IT IS CASTING A CLOUD OVER A POPULATION OF PEOPLE WITH NO FACTUAL EVIDENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:42.336">&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU SOUND LIKE SOMEBODY WHO IS ON DRUGS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.336" end="00:01:44.371">&gt;&gt; NO, I&apos;M NOT ON DRUGS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.371" end="00:01:47.107">&gt;&gt; Reporter: CAN YOU PROVE IT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.107" end="00:01:48.108">HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.108" end="00:01:50.878">PEE IN THE CUP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.878" end="00:01:51.211">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.211" end="00:01:55.649">IF SOMEONE DOESN&apos;T SHOW BACKUP FOR A DRUG TEST THE EQUATION WOULD BE SIMPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:02:00.821">THEY&apos;RE CHOOSING THEIR DRUGS OVER CHOOSING TO GET THAT MONEY FOR THEIR CHILDREN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.821" end="00:02:03.290">&gt;&gt; Reporter: SO YOUR DRUG HABIT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR FAMILY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.290" end="00:02:05.526">&gt;&gt; NO, MY FAMILY IS VERY IMPORTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.526" end="00:02:11.098">AND I&apos;M A FATHER, TAKING CARE OF MY DISABLED MOTHER AND I&apos;M STUDYING TO BE AN ACCOUNTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.098" end="00:02:13.066">&gt;&gt; Reporter: SO AFTER YOU PAY FOR YOUR CHILD&apos;S FOOD,</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.066" end="00:02:14.101">TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOTHER,</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.101" end="00:02:18.105">BUY SCHOOL BOOKS, HOW MUCH MONEY IS LEFT OVER FOR DRUGS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.105" end="00:02:19.940">&gt;&gt; I DONE DO DRUGS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.940" end="00:02:26.413">&gt;&gt; Reporter: HE CAN DENY HIS HABIT, BUT NOT THE SUCCESS OF THE WELFARE DRUG TESTING PROGRAM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.413" end="00:02:28.115">&gt;&gt; HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE FAILED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.115" end="00:02:29.483">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S SOMETHING LIKE 2%.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.483" end="00:02:34.321">&gt;&gt; Reporter: ONLY 2% OF THE PEOPLE ARE PASSING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.321" end="00:02:37.324">&gt;&gt; 2% OF THE PEOPLE ARE FAILING THE DRUG TEST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.324" end="00:02:38.358">&gt;&gt; Reporter: WAIT A MINUTE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.358" end="00:02:43.463">RICK SCOTT SAID THAT WELFARE RECIPIENTS USE DRUGS AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.463" end="00:02:46.099">MAYBE HE WAS HIGH WHEN HE SAID THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.099" end="00:02:51.438">&gt;&gt; THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS THEY HAVE TO PAY THE APPROXIMATELY $30 FOR THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:51.438" end="00:02:51.972">DRUG TEST UP FRONT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.972" end="00:02:53.207">&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHOA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.207" end="00:02:56.777">YOU MEAN THE POOR PEOPLE PAY THE $30 FIRST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.777" end="00:02:58.812">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S CORRECT RTED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.812" end="00:03:02.916">&gt;&gt; AND THEN THE STATE OF FLORIDA REIMBURSES THEM IF THEY PASS THE DRUG TEST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.916" end="00:03:07.921">&gt;&gt; Reporter: AND HUMILIATION FOR THE 98% THAT PASSED IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR A </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.921" end="00:03:13.460">PROGRAM THAT IS SAVED FLORIDIANS NEGATIVE $200,000.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.460" end="00:03:17.531">BUT SOME CAN&apos;T BE BOTHERED WITH STATISTICS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.531" end="00:03:20.634">&gt;&gt; THIS LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VIOLATES THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.634" end="00:03:22.069">&gt;&gt; Reporter: ARE YOU POOR AND ON DRUGS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.069" end="00:03:25.072">WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION?</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.072" end="00:03:28.809">&gt;&gt; I WAS IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.809" end="00:03:29.576">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE A VETERAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.576" end="00:03:33.247">&gt;&gt; YES, I TACK AN OATH TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.247" end="00:03:37.684">&gt;&gt; ANY CITIZEN WHETHER A VETERAN OR NOT SHOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE THE DRUG TEST,</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.684" end="00:03:44.124">AS A VETERAN, I WOULD THINK THAT HE WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FREEDOM OF THE TAXPAYERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.124" end="00:03:46.860">THE TAXPAYERS THAT ARE WORKING DAY AND NIGHT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.860" end="00:03:48.262">SOMETIMES TWO AND THREE JOBS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.262" end="00:03:52.099">AND HE WON&apos;T EVEN DO THIS VERY SIMPLE THING TO HELP HIS FAMILY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.099" end="00:03:53.667">&gt;&gt; I JUST DON&apos;T GET THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.667" end="00:03:57.104">&gt;&gt; SO WHO PAYS YOUR SALARY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.104" end="00:04:03.510">&gt;&gt; THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.510" end="00:04:10.384">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M SORRY, I THINK I&apos;M GOING TO NEED YOU TO PEE INTO THIS CUP.</p>

<p begin="00:04:11.752" end="00:04:18.091">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M NOT GOING TO SUBMIT TO A DRUG TEST BECAUSE AASIF HAS ONE IN MY OFFICE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.091" end="00:04:22.229">&gt;&gt; Reporter: THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO SAID ANYBODY WHO IS RECEIVING HARDWORKING </p>
<p begin="00:04:22.229" end="00:04:25.766">FLORIDIAN TAXPAYERS&apos; MONEY SHOULD SUBMIT TO A DRUG TEST.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.766" end="00:04:31.872">AND I BELIEVE THAT SOMEBODY WAS REPRESENTATIVE SCOTT PLAKIN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.872" end="00:04:35.309">&gt;&gt; IF A LAW PASSED REQUIRING LEGISLATORS TO DO T I WOULD BE HAPPY TO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.309" end="00:04:40.714">&gt;&gt; Reporter: SO WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO BE THE FIRST PERSON TO PUT THAT BILL FORWARD.</p>

<p begin="00:04:43.483" end="00:04:45.853">BUT YOU KNOW, WE GET SIX BILL SLOTS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.853" end="00:04:48.622">SO IF YOU ASK WHAT IS ON THE HIGH PRIORITY OF MY LIST,</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.622" end="00:04:49.656">THAT&apos;S NOT ONE OF THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.656" end="00:04:53.393">&gt;&gt; Reporter: CAN I SAY THAT YOU BEING DRUG TESTED IS PRIORITY NUMBER SEVEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.393" end="00:04:55.796">&gt;&gt; WHAT I AM SAYING IS-- .</p>
