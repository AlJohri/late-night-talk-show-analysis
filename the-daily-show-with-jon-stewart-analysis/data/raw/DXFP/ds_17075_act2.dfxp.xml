<p begin="00:00:03.170" end="00:00:05.906">COMING UP, YOU&apos;RE GOING TO LIKE THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.906" end="00:00:10.377">A FIELD PIECE SO EPIC IT CANNOT BE CONTAINED MERELY IN ONE SEGMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.377" end="00:00:16.517">SO THERE WILL BE NO GUESTS TONIGHT, SORRY AUTHOR OF THE BOOK DEAR GRAVES COOLIDGE,</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.517" end="00:00:20.721">THE TERSE AND FORMAL LOVE LETTERS OF CALVIN COOLIDGE BUT YOU TOO WILL UNDERSTAND </p>
<p begin="00:00:20.721" end="00:00:26.293">OUR CHOICE ONCE YOU WITNESS THIS STARTLING REPORT FILED BY OUR OWN JOHN OLIVER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.293" end="00:00:29.530">&gt;&gt; UNESCO IS AN INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION WHOSE MISSION STATEMENT INCLUDES THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:29.530" end="00:00:34.368">BUILDING OF PEACE, THE IMPROVEMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE ALLEVIATION OF POVERTY WORLDWIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.368" end="00:00:37.037">SO NATURALLY, AMERICA DID THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.037" end="00:00:42.209">&gt;&gt; THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED THE U.S. WILL STOP PAYMENT TO UNESCO AND </p>
<p begin="00:00:42.209" end="00:00:44.044">SUSPEND ALL FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.044" end="00:00:47.681">&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD WE CUT OFF SUPPORT TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT HELPS PEOPLE IN NEED </p>
<p begin="00:00:47.681" end="00:00:49.183">ALL OVER THE WORLD?</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.183" end="00:00:53.487">BECAUSE THEY RECENTLY VOTED TO ADMIT PALESTINIAN AS A MEMBER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.487" end="00:00:54.888">CONGRESSMAN ROBERT WECHSLER EXPLAINS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.888" end="00:01:00.327">&gt;&gt; THE ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS DIRECTLY NEGOTIATE AND IF THE PALESTINIANS SEEK TO GO </p>
<p begin="00:01:00.327" end="00:01:08.468">DIRECTLY TO THE U.N. OR ANY OF ITS AGENCIES, WE&apos;RE NOT GOING TO FUND THOSE AGENCIES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.468" end="00:01:10.871">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:10.871" end="00:01:11.538">&gt;&gt; END OF MESSAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.538" end="00:01:13.640">&gt;&gt; WELL, WE DID SEND A MESSAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.640" end="00:01:14.608">&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE DID.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.608" end="00:01:17.377">BOOM, SUCK IT, UNESCO, SUCK IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.377" end="00:01:20.781">WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS, THOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.781" end="00:01:22.482">UNESCO DOES EXTRAORDINARY WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.482" end="00:01:27.588">MANY OF THE THINGS THEY DO ARE LIFESAVING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.588" end="00:01:32.092">&gt;&gt; SURE THAT&apos;S ALL VERY SAD BUT THE MAIN MESSAGE IS HOMIE DON&apos;T PLAY THAT </p>
<p begin="00:01:32.092" end="00:01:32.359">[BLEEP].</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.359" end="00:01:34.127">&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT&apos;S RIGHT AND OUR HANDS ARE TIED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.127" end="00:01:35.829">THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT&apos;S HANDS ARE TIED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.829" end="00:01:36.864">THIS IS THE LAW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.864" end="00:01:38.232">&gt;&gt; YES, IT&apos;S THE LAW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.232" end="00:01:42.135">A 20-YEAR-OLD LAW WHICH PROHIBITS ANY U.N.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.135" end="00:01:44.404">ORGANIZATION THAT RECOGNIZED PALESTINE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.404" end="00:01:46.440">BUT THIS SITUATION ISN&apos;T OUR FAULT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.440" end="00:01:52.913">&gt;&gt; YOU OUGHT TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE AT UNESCO FOR ACTING FOOLISHLY AND CREATING THIS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.913" end="00:01:55.215">THIS UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.215" end="00:01:56.416">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.416" end="00:02:01.355">UNESCO DIDN&apos;T CARE ABOUT THE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY HAVE PUT AMERICA IN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.355" end="00:02:05.492">ALL THEY CARED ABOUT WAS SOME POOR STARVING PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.492" end="00:02:07.194">&gt;&gt; SO WE CUT YOUR FUNDING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.194" end="00:02:09.162">THAT&apos;S WHAT YOU GET, SON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.162" end="00:02:16.503">&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THERE WERE 100 COUNTRIES IN FAVOR OF PALESTINIAN MEMBERSHIP AS A </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.503" end="00:02:17.704">FULL MEMBER STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.704" end="00:02:21.141">&gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM IS UNESCO HAS ITS OWN LAWS THAT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.141" end="00:02:24.545">WHICH REQUIRES DECISIONS TO BE MADE DEMOCRATICALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.545" end="00:02:26.280">SO YOU BROUGHT IT ON YOURSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:28.682">&gt;&gt; ONE MIGHT SAY THAT WE BROUGHT IT ON OURSELVES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.682" end="00:02:32.452">&gt;&gt; YEAH, I JUST DID SAY THAT I SAID EXACTLY THOSE WORDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.452" end="00:02:39.993">&gt;&gt; BUT WE&apos;RE LOSING A PROGRAM THAT WOULD HELP US FIND WATER FOR 950,000 REFUGEES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.993" end="00:02:42.629">WE&apos;RE WORKING ON ANTI-FAMINE PROGRAMS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.629" end="00:02:46.600">WE&apos;RE HELPING TO PROMOTE EDUCATION IN SOUTH SUDAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.600" end="00:02:50.204">WE HAVE THE TSUNAMI EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.204" end="00:02:51.572">THESE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO BE CUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.572" end="00:02:56.343">&gt;&gt; I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CHOICE BUT TO CUT OFF </p>
<p begin="00:02:56.343" end="00:03:01.782">FUNDING FOR TSUNAMI VICTIMS AND STARVING DROUGHT-RIDEN AFRICAN CHILDREN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.782" end="00:03:04.852">REALLY, YOU OWE THEM AN APOLOGY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.852" end="00:03:07.621">IN FACT, I ACTUALLY HAVE A CARD HERE FOR AFRICA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.621" end="00:03:13.293">IT SAYS SORRY YOU ARE DYING OFS THIRST AND FAMINE, WOULD YOU MIND SIGNING IT, PUTTING </p>
<p begin="00:03:13.293" end="00:03:16.496">GEORGE IN THERE AND OBVIOUSLY WRITING NOT IN FRONT OF SORRY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.496" end="00:03:21.068">&gt;&gt; WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IN THIS CARD IS, WE&apos;RE GOING TO STAY INVOLVED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.068" end="00:03:26.373">WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE PART OF WHAT IS GOING TO MAKE YOUR LIVES BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.373" end="00:03:32.980">&gt;&gt; WHAT A SAME THAT THEY WON&apos;T BE ABLE TO READ THAT BECAUSE YOU CUT 9 I LITERACY PROGRAM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.980" end="00:03:34.948">&gt;&gt; BUT LUCKILY THIS ISN&apos;T GOING TO AFFECT AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.948" end="00:03:36.683">&gt;&gt; SO WHO GIVES A [BLEEP].</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.683" end="00:03:39.753">&gt;&gt; BUT IT DOESN&apos;T COME WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES FOR THE UNITED STATES AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.753" end="00:03:44.591">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IN IRAQ WE WERE ABOUT TO LAUNCH A PROGRAM TO STRENGTHEN THE IRAQIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.591" end="00:03:49.763">IN AFGHANISTAN, 70% OF THE AFGHAN POLICE FORCE IS ILLITERATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.763" end="00:03:55.169">AND WE HAVE A PROGRAM TO TRAIN 3,000 AFGHAN POLICE OFFICERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.169" end="00:03:55.702">&gt;&gt; REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.702" end="00:03:59.239">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S GOOD FOR AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.239" end="00:04:01.475">&gt;&gt; IS THAT ACTUALLY TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.475" end="00:04:06.046">WE&apos;RE CUTTING OFF UNESCO&apos;S PROJECT, THAT ARE CERTAINLY COMPLIMENTARY TO OUR </p>
<p begin="00:04:06.046" end="00:04:08.849">INTERESTS, YES, BUT WE&apos;RE SENDING A POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.849" end="00:04:13.587">THE POINT IS WE HELD INTERESTS, WE HAVE SET UP A LAW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.587" end="00:04:15.622">WE WARNED YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.622" end="00:04:19.660">&gt;&gt; I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW USEFUL IT WOULD BE TO U.S. TROOPS IF THE AFGHAN </p>
<p begin="00:04:19.660" end="00:04:20.727">POLICE FORCE COULD READ.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.727" end="00:04:21.762">&gt;&gt; IT WOULD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.762" end="00:04:25.165">BUT WE&apos;RE ALSO SENDING THE POINT TO OTHER U.N. AGENCIES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.165" end="00:04:25.666">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.666" end="00:04:30.671">&gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU PHYSICALLY CUT OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE, THAT FACE IS </p>
<p begin="00:04:30.671" end="00:04:31.839">SENDING A MESSAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.839" end="00:04:34.341">AND THAT MESSAGE IS DON&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:04:34.341" end="00:04:35.108">[BLEEP] WITH ME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.108" end="00:04:39.246">BECAUSE IF I&apos;M WILLING TO DO THIS TO MYSELF, WHAT AM I WILLING TO DO TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.246" end="00:04:44.318">&gt;&gt; AND THE PROOF IS NO OTHER UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION HAS DONE WHAT UNESCO&apos;S DONE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.318" end="00:04:45.652">AT LEAST NOT YET.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.652" end="00:04:47.087">&gt;&gt; MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.087" end="00:04:52.092">NOW UNLESS UNESCO DOES BA WE WANT, THEY&apos;RE GOING TO FOLD LIKE A BADLY NEEDED </p>
<p begin="00:04:52.092" end="00:04:52.860">IRRIGATION PROJECT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.860" end="00:04:55.863">&gt;&gt; YOU NEED US AND WE&apos;VE GOT YOU BY THE BALLS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.863" end="00:04:57.631">WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.631" end="00:05:01.435">&gt;&gt; THERE ARE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT SEE VALUE IN THE WORK THAT WE&apos;RE DOING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.435" end="00:05:05.772">&gt;&gt; WHAT BIG SPENDER IS GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS HOLE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.772" end="00:05:06.473">&gt;&gt; GABON.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.473" end="00:05:10.210">&gt;&gt; THEY WERE THE FIRST COUNTRY TO STEP UP AND PLEDGE $2 MILLION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.210" end="00:05:12.246">&gt;&gt; GABON GAVE YOU $2 MILLION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.246" end="00:05:13.947">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S CORRECT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.947" end="00:05:15.315">&gt;&gt; [BLEEP] GABON.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.315" end="00:05:22.789">THAT WAS IT I WAS GOING TO GO AND CONFRONT GABON FACE-TO-FACE, AFTER ONE MORE KEY QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.789" end="00:05:24.892">SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE ASKED BEFORE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.892" end="00:05:25.859">WHERE IS GABON?</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.859" end="00:05:27.294">&gt;&gt; WEST COAST OF AFRICAN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.294" end="00:05:29.062">&gt;&gt; RIGHT, I&apos;M OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.062" end="00:05:34.067">COMING UP IN PART TWO, I ACTUALLY GO TO GABON.</p>
