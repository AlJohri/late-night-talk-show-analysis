<p begin="00:00:08.175" end="00:00:12.479">THE iPHONE, THE iPAD, THEY SEEM LIKE THE PERFECT BABY-SITTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.479" end="00:00:15.215">ECONOMICAL, ALWAYS AVAILABLE AND YOU CAN&apos;T HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.215" end="00:00:22.623">(LAUGHTER) BUT DID YOU KNOW THEY COULD ACTUALLY COST YOU MUCH MORE THAN A REAL BABY-SITTER?</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.623" end="00:00:23.724">AASIF MANDVI HAS MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.724" end="00:00:24.791">&gt;&gt; VIDEO GAMES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.791" end="00:00:28.829">FOR YEARS THEY&apos;VE COME UNDER FIRE FOREIGN COURAGING VIOLENCE, PERPETUATING </p>
<p begin="00:00:28.829" end="00:00:34.601">ETHNIC STEREOTYPES, AND INSPIRING THE FAULTY BELIEF THAT IF YOU GET STUCK BEHIND </p>
<p begin="00:00:34.601" end="00:00:37.304">A CAR FOR A FEW SECONDS YOUR HEAD WILL REPAIR ITSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.304" end="00:00:41.041">BUT A NEW ERA OF GAMES HAVE ARRIVED THAT ARE GOOD FOR KIDS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.041" end="00:00:43.110">&gt;&gt; OUR MOST POPULAR GAME IS CALLED TAP FISH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.110" end="00:00:44.878">IT IS A VIRTUAL AQUARIUM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.878" end="00:00:49.983">AND YOU HAVE TO GO IN AND FEED YOUR LITTLE VIRTUAL FISH WITH VIRTUAL FISH FOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.983" end="00:00:53.320">&gt;&gt; AND GAME MAKERS ADDED A VALUABLE TWIST THAT PARENTS LOVE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.320" end="00:00:58.492">&gt;&gt; TRADITIONALLY YOU HAD TO GO TO THE STORE AND BUY A $60 CARTRIDGE IN ORDER TO PLAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.492" end="00:01:01.094">THIS NEW MODEL YOU CAN PLAY GAMES FOR FREE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.094" end="00:01:02.296">&gt;&gt; WOW, FREE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.296" end="00:01:07.901">WHICH EXPLAINS WHY TAP FISH HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED 20 MILLION TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.901" end="00:01:11.205">&gt;&gt; GAMES LIKE TAP FISH ARE VALUABLE TO CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO IN AND TAKE </p>
<p begin="00:01:11.205" end="00:01:13.941">CARE OF THE FISH, IF THEY DON&apos;T, THE FISH WILL DIE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.941" end="00:01:15.375">AND THEN ONCE THEY DIE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.375" end="00:01:15.742">THAT&apos;S IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.742" end="00:01:18.712">WITH A VIRTUAL FISH TANK YOU CAN REVIVE FISH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.712" end="00:01:20.814">BUT IT COST MONEY TO REVIVE THE FISH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.814" end="00:01:22.816">SO THAT&apos;S A GOOD LESSON FOR KIDS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.816" end="00:01:26.954">IF YOU KILL SOMETHING, YOU CAN THROW MONEY AT IT, TO BRING IT BACK TO LIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.954" end="00:01:30.090">&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT&apos;S HOW THE GAME WORKS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:35.462">&gt;&gt; OH SO, IT TURNS OUT THESE GAMES ARE FREE UNTIL YOU DON&apos;T WANT THEM TO SUCK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.462" end="00:01:39.933">AT WHICH POINT KIDS CAN SIMPLY PUSH THIS BUTTON AND INSTANTLY CHARGE $100 WORTH </p>
<p begin="00:01:39.933" end="00:01:45.873">OF BETTER FISH TO AN iTUNES ACCOUNT AND NOBODY HAD A BETTER AQUARIUM THAN THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:45.873" end="00:01:49.109">BETTER RAM KIDS OF MOUNT PELLIER, VERMONT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.109" end="00:01:54.615">&gt;&gt; I WASN&apos;T PAYING ATTENTION TO THEM PLAYING A FREE GAME LIKE THIS AND NEXT THING I </p>
<p begin="00:01:54.615" end="00:01:58.385">KNOW THEY SPENT OVER $1500 BUCKS FOR CRAP DIGITAL FISHIES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.385" end="00:02:01.054">&gt;&gt; YOU SPENT OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS PLAYING TAP FISH?</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.054" end="00:02:03.090">&gt;&gt; THAT WAS ALL HE HAD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.090" end="00:02:05.192">&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, I MIGHT HAVE GONE OVER -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:05.192" end="00:02:07.594">&gt;&gt; SO YOU MAXED OUT THE CREDIT CARD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.594" end="00:02:10.697">&gt;&gt; IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.697" end="00:02:11.732"> YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.732" end="00:02:15.502">&gt;&gt; Reporter: EVEN THOUGH AN INTERVENTION HAS BEEN STAGED FOR THESE KIDS, TAP FISH IS </p>
<p begin="00:02:15.502" end="00:02:18.872">STILL PULLING IN A MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.872" end="00:02:20.574">&gt;&gt; YOU PROVIDE A PRODUCT,</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.574" end="00:02:21.942">THE FIRST ONE IS FREE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.942" end="00:02:25.345">AND THEN AS THEY GET MORE ACCUSTOMED TO YOUR PRODUCT,</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.345" end="00:02:27.748">THE PRICE RISES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.748" end="00:02:28.081">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.081" end="00:02:29.783">&gt;&gt; SO YOU ARE A DRUG DEALER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.783" end="00:02:31.485">&gt;&gt; NO, WE&apos;RE NOT LIKE A DRUG DEALER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.485" end="00:02:35.889">I MEAN WE&apos;VE HAD MANY PARENTS E-MAIL US, TELL US THAT THIS GAME IS TEACHING </p>
<p begin="00:02:35.889" end="00:02:37.991">THEIR KIDS RESPONSIBILITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.991" end="00:02:42.095">WE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO A PARENT WHOSE KID LOVES YOUR GAME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.095" end="00:02:45.566">WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TALK TO HIM ON THE PHONE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.566" end="00:02:47.935">&gt;&gt; WOULD I BE WILLING TO TALK TO HIM ON THE PHONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.935" end="00:02:49.570">&gt;&gt; TALK TO HIM ON THE PHONE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.570" end="00:02:53.006">RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.006" end="00:02:56.176">&gt;&gt; WE-- I WOULD RATHER HANDLE THESE THINGS VIA E-MAIL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.176" end="00:02:59.880">&gt;&gt; RIGHT, RIGHT, BUT THIS PARENT JUST WANTS TO LIKE TALK TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.880" end="00:03:03.317">HOLD ON, I&apos;M GOING TO PUT YOU-- MICHAEL?</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.317" end="00:03:04.618">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.618" end="00:03:04.952">&gt;&gt; HI.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.952" end="00:03:12.092">OKAY, SO ARE YOU ON WITH THE C.E.O. OF TAP FISH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.092" end="00:03:15.229">&gt;&gt; YOU PEOPLE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.229" end="00:03:16.930">I THINK IT IS OUTRAGEOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.930" end="00:03:22.369">&gt;&gt; AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT 20 MINUTES THEY NEVER DID EXCHANGE E-MAILS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.369" end="00:03:24.404">&gt;&gt; DO THESE GAMES TARGET KIDS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.404" end="00:03:27.808">&gt;&gt; I WOULDN&apos;T SAY WE NECESSARILY TARGET KIDS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.808" end="00:03:30.210">&gt;&gt; YOU CAN STILL PLAY OUR GAMES FOR FREE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.210" end="00:03:31.545">THAT&apos;S THE IMPORTANT PART.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.545" end="00:03:33.247">&gt;&gt; TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.247" end="00:03:35.215">YOU KNOW-- AND THEN -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:35.215" end="00:03:37.351">&gt;&gt; KIDS ARE SMARTER THAN YOU THINK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.351" end="00:03:38.185">&gt;&gt; ARE THEY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.185" end="00:03:43.524">&gt;&gt; CHILDREN&apos;S BRAINS ARE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.524" end="00:03:46.894">THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTROLS IMPULSES,</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.894" end="00:03:50.364">IT DOESN&apos;T FULLY DEVELOP UNTIL WE ARE IN OUR LATE 20s.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.364" end="00:03:53.567">THEY ARE VERY DRAWN TO ANYTHING THAT MOVES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.567" end="00:03:54.768">ANYTHING THAT IS COLOURFUL,</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.768" end="00:03:59.640">IF YOU THREATEN DEATH OF ANIMALS, FOR INSTANCE, KIDS ARE GOING TO BE EMOTIONALLY </p>
<p begin="00:03:59.640" end="00:04:01.775">INVESTED IN THAT AND NOT WANT IT TO HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.775" end="00:04:07.848">&gt;&gt; ARE THERE ANY OTHER MENTAL DEFICIENCIES IN CHILDREN THAT WE CAN PROFIT FROM?</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.848" end="00:04:10.317">&gt;&gt; I MEAN THEY ARE LEARNING RESPONSIBILITY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.317" end="00:04:14.221">IF YOU DON&apos;T TAKE CARE OF THINGS, THEY GET DIRTY,</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.221" end="00:04:16.690">MESSY, OR THE FISH DIES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.690" end="00:04:22.496">&gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE KIDS HAVE AN UNDERDEVELOPED FRONTAL CORTEX, THEY WANT TO KEEP </p>
<p begin="00:04:22.496" end="00:04:25.199">LEARNING HOW TO TAKE CARE OF FISH, RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:27.568">&gt;&gt; KID DOES LIKE TO LEARN,</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.568" end="00:04:28.602">THAT&apos;S TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.602" end="00:04:29.069">&gt;&gt; THEY SURE DO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.069" end="00:04:33.707">&gt;&gt; IF THERE WAS A GAME CALLED MAX OUT YOUR DAD&apos;S CREDIT CARD, WE WOULD HAVE WON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.707" end="00:04:40.214">&gt;&gt; AND THANKS TO MY COUSIN IN BANGALORE, NOW THERE&apos;S AN APP FOR THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.214" end="00:04:43.217">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE MAXED OUT!</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.217" end="00:04:43.483">&gt;&gt; </p>
