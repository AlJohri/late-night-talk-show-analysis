<p begin="00:00:07.207" end="00:00:10.611">OUR GUESTS TONIGHT, THE UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF EDUCATION PLEASE WELCOME TO </p>
<p begin="00:00:10.611" end="00:00:12.813">THE PROGRAM SECRETARY ARNE DUNCAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.813" end="00:00:13.347">SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.347" end="00:00:21.889">(APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:00:21.889" end="00:00:23.190">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.190" end="00:00:24.224">&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR HAVING ME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.224" end="00:00:28.161">&gt;&gt; Jon: FOR THOSE PEOPLE WITHOUT DON&apos;T REALIZE YOU YOURSELF PLAYED BASKETBALL </p>
<p begin="00:00:28.161" end="00:00:34.535">AT HARVARD, AND KNOW THIS PHENOM JEREMY LIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.535" end="00:00:35.235">&gt;&gt; HE&apos;S AN AMAZING YOUNG KID,</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.235" end="00:00:35.869">SO PROUD OF HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.869" end="00:00:39.940">HE&apos;S BEEN THROUGH A LOT BUT HE&apos;S THE ULTIMATE WINNER AND IS MAKING HIS TEAMMATES BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.940" end="00:00:43.410">WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT BASKETBALL, IT&apos;S A TEAM SPORT, IT&apos;S NOT GOLF AND </p>
<p begin="00:00:43.410" end="00:00:45.112">HE&apos;S GETTING EVERYBODY INVOLVED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.112" end="00:00:50.217">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE WAY THE KNICKS HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT HAVE BEEN VERY SIMILAR TO GOLF.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.217" end="00:00:54.021">THAT YOU TRY AND GET A BALL IN THIS HOLE AND YOU JUST CAN&apos;T FIGURE IT OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.021" end="00:00:55.155">YOU KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.155" end="00:00:57.824">WHEN YOU GRADUATED HARVARD,</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.824" end="00:01:04.164">DID YOU, I MEAN, IS IT A DISAPPOINTMENT, I GUESS, FOR TO YOU HAVE ENDED UP JUST AS </p>
<p begin="00:01:04.164" end="00:01:06.400">THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION?</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.400" end="00:01:09.369">NOT-- NOT OBVIOUSLY AN NBA SUPERSTAR?</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.369" end="00:01:13.841">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M SO THRILLED FOR HIM AND NO ONE DESERVES IT MORE THAN HIM AND HIS HUMILITY,</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.841" end="00:01:17.311">HIS WILLINGNESS TO WORK HARD WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE DOUBTED HIM AND DIDN&apos;T GIVE HIM A CHANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.311" end="00:01:21.081">I THINK THE EXAMPLE HE SETS FOR YOUNG KIDS AROUND THIS COUNTRY, ASIAN AMERICANS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.081" end="00:01:23.183">WHITE KIDS, BLACK KIDS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.183" end="00:01:25.919">HISPANIC KIDS HE IS A REMARKABLE ROLE MODEL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.919" end="00:01:26.954">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M HOPING IT WILL CHANGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.954" end="00:01:32.092">IT WILL GET A COUPLE OF DATES IN WITH THE KARDASHIANS AND THE WHOLE THING GOES TO HELL, BELIEVE ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.092" end="00:01:33.827">&gt;&gt; NO NEW FRIENDS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.827" end="00:01:36.897">STICK WITH THE OLD FRIENDS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.897" end="00:01:37.865">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET&apos;S MOVE ON TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.865" end="00:01:39.633">SO MY MOTHER IS A TEACHER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.633" end="00:01:42.269">AND HER FRIENDS ARE TEACHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.269" end="00:01:45.706">AND THEY CALL ME ALL HOURS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.706" end="00:01:48.108">REALLY OF THE DAY AND NIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.108" end="00:01:53.814">AND THEY HAVE AN ISSUE, A LITTLE BIT W THIS RACE TO THE TOP INITIATIVE THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.814" end="00:01:56.884">IT WAS I GUESS A FIX TO NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.884" end="00:01:57.651">EXPLAIN RACE TO THE TOP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.651" end="00:01:59.319">&gt;&gt; WELL, A COUPLE OF THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.319" end="00:02:02.189">RACE TO THE TOP HAS DONE A COUPLE OF THINGS I THINK ARE SO IMPORTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.189" end="00:02:07.127">WE ARE SEEING 46 STATES RAISE STANDARDS, FOR EVERY SINGLE CHILD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.127" end="00:02:08.929">WE&apos;RE TURNING AROUND UNDERPERFORMING SCHOOLS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.929" end="00:02:11.665">I THINK NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WAS LARGELY BROKEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.665" end="00:02:13.700">WE&apos;RE NOW PROVIDING WAIVER,</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.700" end="00:02:16.570">FLEXIBILITY TO STATES, WHO WANTED CONGRESS TO FIX IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.570" end="00:02:19.473">CONGRESS IS PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL THESE DAY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.473" end="00:02:19.907">UNFORTUNATELY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.907" end="00:02:20.874">&gt;&gt; Jon: I HAD NOT HEARD THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.874" end="00:02:22.943">&gt;&gt; SO WE&apos;RE TRAYING TO FIX THINGS THE BEST WAY WE CAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.943" end="00:02:26.947">WE CAN&apos;T WAIT FOR THEM TO MOVE AND WE CAME FROM AMAZING INNOVATION,</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.947" end="00:02:28.315">CREATIVITY COMING FROM STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.315" end="00:02:28.982">&gt;&gt; Stephen: .</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.982" end="00:02:32.186">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT&apos;S INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT IT IS A LOT OFth RHETORIC ON THE RACE TO THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:32.186" end="00:02:36.123">TOP AND THE RESPECT INITIATIVE IS ABOUT INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.123" end="00:02:43.096">BUT WHAT I HEAR FROM THE TEACHERS IS THAT THERE IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN </p>
<p begin="00:02:43.096" end="00:02:48.569">CREATED THAT IS ACTUALLY MORE CONFINING BECAUSE IT IS CAUSING THE SCHOOLS TO TEACH </p>
<p begin="00:02:48.569" end="00:02:53.407">TO THE TESTS THAT THEY MUST HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR GRANT MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.407" end="00:03:00.214">AND THAT, AND THE THREE TEACHERS HERE TODAY-- ARE-- I THINK IT TENDS TO FRUSTRATE </p>
<p begin="00:03:00.214" end="00:03:06.086">THEM RATHER THAN FREE THEM TO BE CREATIVE AND POWERFUL INNOVATIVE TEACHERS THAT YOU </p>
<p begin="00:03:06.086" end="00:03:07.087">ARE LOOKING FOR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.087" end="00:03:09.890">&gt;&gt; RIGHT, SO I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THAT AND THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.890" end="00:03:12.092">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO THERE WE G SO WE&apos;RE DONE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.092" end="00:03:14.695">&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED IT DIRECTLY IN THE STATE OF UNION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.695" end="00:03:16.763">HE SAID WE HAVE TO STOP TEACHING IT TO THE TEST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.763" end="00:03:21.802">I LIVED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAW FOR SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS WHEN I RAN CHI PUBLIC SCHOOL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.802" end="00:03:25.072">THAT IS THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT I HEAR AS I TRAVEL THE COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.072" end="00:03:30.077">YES, READING AND MATH ARE FUNDAMENTAL, FOUNDATIONAL BUT SCIENCE, SOCIAL STUDIES,</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.077" end="00:03:31.745">DANCE, DRAMA, ART, MUSIC,</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.745" end="00:03:35.215">FOREIGN LANGUAGES, PE, ALL THOSE THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.215" end="00:03:38.952">AND WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THE FLEXIBILITY STATE IS MOVING AWAY FROM NO CHILD </p>
<p begin="00:03:38.952" end="00:03:41.088">LEFT BEHIND IS SAYING ALL THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.088" end="00:03:42.689">YES, SO IS READING AND MATH,</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.689" end="00:03:46.760">WE HAVE TO HAVE A WELL-ROUNDED, WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION FOR EVERY CHILD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.760" end="00:03:49.963">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT ARE WE NOT STILL BROADENING THE CURRICULUM,</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.963" end="00:03:53.500">OKAY YOU DON&apos;T LIKE THE NARROWNESS OF THE TESTS IN THESE TWO SUBJECTS WHAT IF </p>
<p begin="00:03:53.500" end="00:03:57.337">WE GIVE YOU A LAZY SUSAN OF TESTS FOR A LOT OF -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:57.337" end="00:03:59.439">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK IT&apos;S THAT AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.439" end="00:04:00.807">TESTS TELL YOU SOME THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.807" end="00:04:04.945">THEY DON&apos;T TELL YOU LOTS OF OTHER THINGS SWRECHLT TO STOP FOCUS ON THE ABSOLUTE TEST SCORE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.945" end="00:04:08.348">WE HAVE TO LOOK AT GROWTH IN GAINS, HOW MUCH THE STUDENT IS IMPROVING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.348" end="00:04:10.384">I&apos;M MORE INTERESTED IN LONGER TERM OUTCOME,</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.384" end="00:04:11.051">LONG-TERM OUTCOMES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.051" end="00:04:12.719">OUR GRADUATION RATE IS GOING UP.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.719" end="00:04:14.121">OUR DROPOUT RATE GOING DOWN,</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.121" end="00:04:17.558">ARE MORE STUDENTS READY FOR COLLEGE R THEY PERSEVERING IN COLLEGE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.558" end="00:04:19.059">WE HAVE TODAY KATE TO A BETTER ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.059" end="00:04:20.260">THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.260" end="00:04:24.064">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THIS THE WAY TO DO IN YOU KNOW THE THING THAT STRIKES ME, AND I KNOW </p>
<p begin="00:04:24.064" end="00:04:28.836">HOW DIFFICULT IT IS I THINK EDUCATION IS PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT AREA TO ATTACK BECAUSE OF THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:28.836" end="00:04:30.537">ECOSYSTEM THAT IT IS INVOLVED IN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.537" end="00:04:32.072">IT&apos;S NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.072" end="00:04:37.077">AND IT IS NOT, BUT SO MUCH OF THE ONUS NOW IS ON THE TEACHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.077" end="00:04:42.850">AND BY CREATING THESE BENCHMARKS, IT GIVES THE FALSE OF IMPRESSION THAT TEACHING IS SCIENCE WHEN IN </p>
<p begin="00:04:42.850" end="00:04:45.185">MANY WAY TEACHING IS AN ART.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.185" end="00:04:46.553">&gt;&gt; TEACHING IS AN ABSOLUTE ART.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.553" end="00:04:50.691">I THINK WHAT WE HAVE DONE AS A COUNTRY IS WE HAVE BEATEN DOWN TEACHERS, EDUCATION,</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.691" end="00:04:52.726">THIS WHOLE RESPECT PROJECT THAT WE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY,</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.726" end="00:04:55.462">IS TRYING TO DRAMATICALLY ELEVATE THE PROFESSION,</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.462" end="00:04:56.129">STRENGTHEN THE PROFESSION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.129" end="00:04:57.497">IT TAKES YEARS TO MASTER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.497" end="00:05:01.268">YOUR MOM IS A TEACHER, MY MOM HAS BEEN WORKING IN THE INNER CITY FOR 50 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.268" end="00:05:03.036">I KNOW HOW HARD THIS WORK IS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.036" end="00:05:04.037">WE TREATED EVERYBODY THE SAME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.037" end="00:05:05.472">WE HAVEN&apos;T RECOGNIZED EXCELLENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.472" end="00:05:06.740">WE HAVEN&apos;T AWARDED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:09.810">WE HAVEN&apos;T LEARNED FROM IT I HAVE BEEN VERY PUBLIC WE SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY </p>
<p begin="00:05:09.810" end="00:05:11.044">INCREASE TEACHER SALARIES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.044" end="00:05:15.616">NO ONE GOES INTO IT FOR THE MONEY BUT YOU SHOULDN&apos;T HAVE TO TAKE THE VOW OF POVERTY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.616" end="00:05:18.051">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, I THINK YOU MOSTLY GO INTO IF FORTH MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.051" end="00:05:22.756">THE PEOPLE I MEET WITH THEIR TOYOTAS, I HAVE SEEN-- I HAVE SEEN SOME THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.756" end="00:05:25.893">&gt;&gt; WE NEED, WE HAVE A BABY BOOMING GENERATION RETIRING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.893" end="00:05:28.962">WE&apos;RE GOING TO NEED A UNTIL NEW GRADE TEACHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.962" end="00:05:35.769">&gt;&gt; Jon: I LOVE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, BUT ISN&apos;T RACE TO THE TOP THE EXACT THING THAT </p>
<p begin="00:05:35.769" end="00:05:39.206">DEMORALLIZED THEM EVEN FURTHER THAN NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE THAT IS THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:39.206" end="00:05:45.078">ISSUE, ISN&apos;T I THINK INTENTION, BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE INTENTION OF IF I WERE </p>
<p begin="00:05:45.078" end="00:05:49.416">IN EDUCATION OR THE PRESIDENT, THE RHETORIC YOU HEAR IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.416" end="00:05:54.254">BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT THE METHODOLOGY THAT THEY HAVE EMPLOYED HAS NOT HAD THAT EFFECT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.254" end="00:05:58.992">AND MAYBE IS THIS NOT THE BEST USE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.992" end="00:06:03.263">BECAUSE EDUCATION IS SUCH THE DIVERSITY OF LOCALITY,</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.263" end="00:06:08.669">IT REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT EXISTS IN THE AREAS THIS WHICH THE KIDS ARE EDUCATED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.669" end="00:06:11.538">&gt;&gt; WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS EMPOWER STATES AND DISTRICTS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.538" end="00:06:14.608">I ALWAYS SAID I DON&apos;T WANT TO MICROMANAGE FROM WASHINGTON, CAN&apos;T DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.608" end="00:06:17.044">THE BEST IDEAS WILL ALWAYS COME FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL,</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.044" end="00:06:19.046">NOT FROM ME OR FRANKLY ANYONE ELSE FROM WASHINGTON.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.046" end="00:06:23.116">THE BEAUTY OF THE PLANS IS WE ARE TRADING TO EMPOWER GREAT LOCAL TEACHERS AND </p>
<p begin="00:06:23.116" end="00:06:27.955">PRINCIPALS AND PARENTS AND SUPERINTENDENTS, TO PUT IN PLACE THEIR PLANS TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.955" end="00:06:31.325">OUR CHALLENGE IS 44, 45 STATES, RURAL, URBAN,</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.325" end="00:06:34.094">SUBURBAN, ANSWERS AREN&apos;T GOING TO COME FROM US.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.094" end="00:06:36.196">THEY WILL COME IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.196" end="00:06:41.301">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT EDUCATION SUFFERS FROM IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT THE </p>
<p begin="00:06:41.301" end="00:06:42.636">PARADIGM NEEDS TO BE SHIFTED,</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.636" end="00:06:45.772">THAT IT SEAMS THAT EDUCATION HAS BEEN CLOISTERED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.772" end="00:06:50.210">AND NO LONGER HAS THE SHAME APPLICATION-- SAME APPLICATION TO THE MODERN WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.210" end="00:06:51.912">WE&apos;RE STILL WORKING OFF OF THE PAST.</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.912" end="00:06:56.917">AND TRYING TO FIX THINGS THAT ARE REALLY NOT APP RA PO IN TODAY&apos;S -- </p>
<p begin="00:06:56.917" end="00:07:00.687">&gt;&gt; I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS THAT WE HAVE BECOME TOO COMPLACENT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.687" end="00:07:03.190">WE&apos;RE 16th IN THE WORLD TODAY IN COLLEGE GRADUATES.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.190" end="00:07:04.558">A GENERATION AGO WE WERE FIRST.</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.558" end="00:07:05.926">IT ISN&apos;T THAT WE HAVE DROPPED.</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.926" end="00:07:08.662">WE HAVE FLAT LINED IN 15 OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED US BY.</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.662" end="00:07:10.831">WE HAVE TO EDUCATE OUR WAY TO A BETTER ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.831" end="00:07:14.501">THERE ARE 2 MILLION JOBS OUT THERE TODAY IN OUR COUNTRY THAT WE CAN&apos;T FILL BECAUSE </p>
<p begin="00:07:14.501" end="00:07:17.237">WE DON&apos;T HAVE THE EDUCATED WORKFORCE TO FILL THOSE JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.237" end="00:07:21.041">SO WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO.</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.041" end="00:07:24.111">&gt;&gt; WE HAVE A MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL EVERY YEAR, A MILLION,</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.111" end="00:07:27.848">THERE ARE NO JOB, NONE, THEY ARE GUARANTEED POVERTY AND SOCIAL FAILURE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.848" end="00:07:31.685">WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO, TAKE RISK AND DO THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY </p>
<p begin="00:07:31.685" end="00:07:33.320">BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH BAR.</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.320" end="00:07:35.088">WE HAVE TO HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.088" end="00:07:37.624">&gt;&gt; Jon: I GUESS THE WAY YOU DEFINE THE BAR IS PROBABLY THE DIFFICULTY.</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.624" end="00:07:38.959">CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR TWO SECONDS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.959" end="00:07:40.694">CAN YOU STAY AFTER SCHOOL,</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.694" end="00:07:41.628">AS IT WERE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.628" end="00:07:42.663">&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.663" end="00:07:45.132">&gt;&gt; Jon: SECRETARY ARNE DUNCAN, WE&apos;LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS.</p>
