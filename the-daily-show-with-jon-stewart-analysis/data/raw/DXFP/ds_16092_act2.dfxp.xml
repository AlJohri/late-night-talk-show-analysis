<p begin="00:02:13.133" end="00:02:14.268">&gt;&gt; Jon: I MENTIONED THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.268" end="00:02:17.538">&gt;&gt; BUT THE SILVER LINING WAS THAT YOU SAID YOU LIED TO ME.</p>

<p begin="00:02:32.953" end="00:02:34.821">HOW IS IT... EXPLAIN TO US.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.821" end="00:02:42.129">IT&apos;S HARD FOR US TO IMAGINE A HIGH-LEVEL INDIVIDUAL LIKE THAT TO BE ABLE TO ENSCONCE HIMSELF </p>
<p begin="00:02:42.129" end="00:02:45.332">IN A NEIGHBORHOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.332" end="00:02:48.402">ABBOTTABAD IS NICE, GOLF COURSES, PEOPLE RETIRE THERE.</p>

<p begin="00:02:50.971" end="00:02:54.241">HOW DID IT... IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN THERE AND NO ONE KNEW?</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.241" end="00:02:56.176">&gt;&gt; YES, IT IS VERY POSSIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.176" end="00:03:03.851">IT&apos;S VERY POSSIBLE BECAUSE IF YOU EVEN SEE WHERE HE WAS LIVING AND HE WAS NOT GUARDED, THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.851" end="00:03:08.956">INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES KNEW OR THE ARMY KNEW, WOULD HE... WOULD THEY LEAVE HIM THERE UNGUARDED </p>
<p begin="00:03:08.956" end="00:03:18.799">SO THAT HE ESCAPES AND WHEN C.I.A. COMES AND OCCUPIES A SAFE HOUSE CLOSE BY, WOULD... IF I </p>
<p begin="00:03:18.799" end="00:03:25.973">I.S.I. KNEW OR OUR INTELLIGENCE KNEW WOULD RELET HIM ESCAPE BECAUSE...</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.973" end="00:03:30.077">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT ISN&apos;T THAT WHY WE DIDN&apos;T... THE U.S. DIDN&apos;T TELL </p>
<p begin="00:03:30.077" end="00:03:31.144">PAKISTAN BECAUSE THEY DIDN&apos;T...</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.144" end="00:03:37.384">THE TRUST HAD BECOME SO BROKEN AT THAT POINT THEY THOUGHT IF THEY DID TELL THAT THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:37.384" end="00:03:40.821">POSSIBILITY EXISTED THAT HE WOULD GET AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.821" end="00:03:47.561">&gt;&gt; I THINK IF I.S.I. KNEW AND THERE WAS COMPLICITY THEN THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT C.I.A. HAS </p>
<p begin="00:03:47.561" end="00:03:54.568">OCCUPIED A SAFE HOUSE VERY CLOSE AND IF THEY KNEW THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HEM TO ESCAPE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.568" end="00:03:56.737">AS IT IS HE WAS SITTING THERE UNGUARDED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.737" end="00:04:03.644">WHY WOULD THE ARMY OR INTELLIGENCE ALLOW HIM TO BE IN A HOUSE WHERE HE COULD ESCAPE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.644" end="00:04:04.378">COME AND GO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.378" end="00:04:06.647">SUCH AN IMPORTANT INDIVIDUAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.647" end="00:04:09.816">WHY WOULDN&apos;T THEY USE HIM FOR THAT MATTER IF HE WAS THERE FOR </p>
<p begin="00:04:09.816" end="00:04:14.922">FIVE YEARS WHY WOULDN&apos;T I USE HIM FOR SOME LEVERAGE FOR MYSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.922" end="00:04:15.455">&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.455" end="00:04:20.460">WELL, I GUESS I&apos;LL ASK YOU THEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.460" end="00:04:25.065">(LAUGHS)  IT&apos;S JUST HARD FOR ME... HE WAS LIVING IN A MILLION-DOLLAR HOUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.065" end="00:04:27.835">THEY SAY IT WAS THE ONLY HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOR THAT BURNED THEIR OWN TRASH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.835" end="00:04:35.409">IF A YOUNGSTER KICKED A SOCCER BALL OVER THE WALL THEY JUST PAID THE YOUNGSTER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.409" end="00:04:39.646">PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ARE LIKE &quot;WEIRD FOLKS LIVING THERE.&quot; (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:04:39.646" end="00:04:46.220">DIDN&apos;T IT RAISE THE... THIS IS... ABBOTTABAD IS THE TOWN THAT BASICALLY HOUSES PAKISTAN&apos;S </p>

<p begin="00:06:19.913" end="00:06:21.248">BECAUSE YOU TRUST US?</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.248" end="00:06:26.854">&gt;&gt; THERE ARE INTELLIGENCE FAILURES, THIS IS NOT A CASE OF COMPLICITY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.854" end="00:06:28.355">IT&apos;S CERTAINLY A CASE OF NEGLIGENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.355" end="00:06:33.527">AFTER ALL, IF YOU GO BACK TO 9/11, WASN&apos;T C.I.A. THE MOST POWERFUL ORGANIZATION?</p>
