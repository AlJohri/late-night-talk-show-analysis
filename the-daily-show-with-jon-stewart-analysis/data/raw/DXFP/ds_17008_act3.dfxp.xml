<p begin="00:00:06.540" end="00:00:07.107">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.107" end="00:00:10.611">MY GUEST TONIGHT, A SENIOR EDITOR FOR NATIONAL REVOW,</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.611" end="00:00:12.646">HE&apos;S ALSO A HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.646" end="00:00:24.224">HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED JAMES MADISON, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM RICHARD BROOKHISER, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.224" end="00:00:24.825">HOW ARE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.825" end="00:00:26.260">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.260" end="00:00:29.663">FIRST OF ALL, THE BOOK IS CALLED JAMES MADISON.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.663" end="00:00:40.541">THANK YOU FOR WRITING A BOOK AND SHOWING ONCE AGAIN THAT THE ALTITUDE NALLY CHALLENGED AMONG US CAN </p>
<p begin="00:00:40.541" end="00:00:42.309">STILL BE SUCCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.309" end="00:00:45.045">JAMES MADISON, PEOPLE DON&apos;T ROLIZE THIS, 8 INCHES TALL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.045" end="00:00:46.380">&gt;&gt; 5, 6.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.380" end="00:00:47.748">&gt;&gt; Jon: WAS HE 5, 6.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.748" end="00:00:49.116">THAT IS EVEN MORE GENEROUS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.116" end="00:00:50.884">I THOUGHT HE WAS 5,.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.884" end="00:00:54.955">&gt;&gt; THEY TELL ME IN MONTPELIER WHICH IS HIS HOME WHICH IS NOW A NATIONAL SITE,</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.955" end="00:00:56.323">THAT HE WAS 5, 6.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.323" end="00:00:59.393">I JUST HAD AN E-MAIL EXCHANGE ON THIS YESTERDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.393" end="00:01:00.360">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.360" end="00:01:00.694">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.694" end="00:01:04.431">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THAT, SHORT PEOPLE CAN NEVER GIVE IT UP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.431" end="00:01:10.270">EVEN IN DEATH, THEY ARE STILL LIKE I&apos;M SURE MADISON IS IN HIS GRAVE LIKE 5, 6.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.270" end="00:01:16.076">&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, HE COMES AFTER THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO WAS OVER 6 FEET.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.076" end="00:01:17.211">&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL THOSE GUY,</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.211" end="00:01:19.112">WASHINGTON WAS A BIG DUDE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.112" end="00:01:20.814">ALL THESE GUYS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.814" end="00:01:25.652">MADISON IS SUCH AN INTERESTING FIGURE BECAUSE IN MY MIND I ALWAYS ASSOCIATE HIM WITH THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:25.652" end="00:01:29.223">FEDERALIST PAPERS AND WITH -- </p>
<p begin="00:01:29.223" end="00:01:31.325">&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE CO-AUTHORS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.325" end="00:01:31.792">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.792" end="00:01:37.397">AND WITH CREATING ALMOST THE SENSE AND THEORY OF OUR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT BUT ONCE </p>
<p begin="00:01:37.397" end="00:01:41.902">HAMILTON GOT HIS FINGERS IN THERE, MADISON REALLY BACKED AWAY FROM THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.902" end="00:01:43.537">&gt;&gt; HE BACKED AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.537" end="00:01:48.809">HAMILTON HAS AN ECONOMIC PLAN WHICH APPARENTLY THEY DIDN&apos;T DISCUSS WHEN WHEN </p>
<p begin="00:01:48.809" end="00:01:54.214">THEY WERE DOING THE FEDERALIST PAPERS AND ONCE HAMILTON STARTS PRESIDENTING THAT INTO WORK, MADISON </p>
<p begin="00:01:54.214" end="00:01:55.182">DOESN&apos;T LIKE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.182" end="00:01:56.550">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS THE CENTRAL BANK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.550" end="00:01:58.151">&gt;&gt; THE CENTRAL BANK,</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.151" end="00:02:01.388">HAMILTON WAS A MERCHANT&apos;S CLERK IN THE WEST ENDIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.388" end="00:02:03.090">MADISON IS A VIRGINIA PLANTER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.090" end="00:02:07.160">SO THEY COME FROM TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS AND THEY SEE IT IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.160" end="00:02:09.596">AND MADISON IS JUST VERY SUSPICIOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.596" end="00:02:10.631">AND HE DOESN&apos;T LIKE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.631" end="00:02:15.736">SO BUT WHAT INTERESTED ME IN THIS BOOK IS WHAT MADISON THEN DID ABOUT IT ONCE HE </p>
<p begin="00:02:15.736" end="00:02:19.806">SEES HAMILTON GOING OFF IN WHAT HE THINKS IS THE WRONG DIRECTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.806" end="00:02:20.474">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.474" end="00:02:22.176">AND HE THINKS THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.176" end="00:02:25.245">MADISON FEELS THIS REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.245" end="00:02:28.315">&gt;&gt; YES, THIS IS NOT AN ENUMERATED POWER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.315" end="00:02:33.086">HAMILTON SAYS WELL, A IT ALLOWS THE UNITED STATES TO RAISE LOANS ON THE CREDIT OF </p>
<p begin="00:02:33.086" end="00:02:37.291">THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS AN I ENUMERATE POD WE ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.291" end="00:02:40.727">&gt;&gt; Jon: REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD GOOD CREDIT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.727" end="00:02:41.795">THOSE WERE THE DAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.795" end="00:02:43.163">&gt;&gt; WE COULD USE SOME OF THAT AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.163" end="00:02:51.939">BUT SO WHAT MADISON DOES IS HE INVENTS THE FIRST NATIONAL POLITICAL PARTY TO OPPOSE HAMILTON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.939" end="00:02:57.811">AND HE-- THE FIRST STEP HE TAKES, HE AND HIS BEST FRIEND THOMAS JEFFERSON, HIS </p>
<p begin="00:02:57.811" end="00:03:03.250">EIGHT YEARS OLDER BEST, BEST FRIEND, THEY TAKE A VACATION IN THE SUMMER OF 171.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.250" end="00:03:07.754">THEY LEAVE PHILADELPHIA, THE CAPITAL TO GO TO NEW YORK CITY, AND THEY GO UP THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.754" end="00:03:14.828">HUDSON TO LAKE GEORGE AND LAKE CHAMPLAIN, AND THEIR THEY&apos;RE CANOEING, FISHING,</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.828" end="00:03:17.931">AND THEN THEY COME BACK TO NEW ENGLAND, TO NEW YORK,</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.931" end="00:03:19.666">AND THEY GO BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.666" end="00:03:24.137">BUT THERE&apos;S A LAWYER IN NEW YORK CITY WHO&apos;S A GOOD FRIEND OF HAMILTONS AND HE </p>
<p begin="00:03:24.137" end="00:03:30.277">WRITES HIM A LETTER IN PHILADELPHIA AND SAYS THERE&apos;S A PASSIONATE COURTSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.277" end="00:03:33.680">AND ENEMIES OF YOURS IN NEW YORK STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:37.918">SO THEY&apos;RE COLLECTING POLITICAL ALLIES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.918" end="00:03:39.620">IN ANOTHER STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.620" end="00:03:42.923">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT IS THE BEST ROAD TRIP MOVIE I COULD EVER IMAGINE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.923" end="00:03:47.094">I IMAGINE THEM IN LIKE A CONVERTIBLE AND THEN YOU HERE LIKE, I FEEL GOOD,nd </p>
<p begin="00:03:47.094" end="00:03:48.529">THEN THEY&apos;RE LIKE DRIVING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.529" end="00:03:55.202">HOW DO THEY-- IS THEIR GOAL AT THIS POINT TO CREATE THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM OR IS THEIR </p>
<p begin="00:03:55.202" end="00:04:00.040">GOAL MERELY TO TAKE SOME OF THE WIND OUT OF THE, I GUESS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL THEM NOW </p>
<p begin="00:04:00.040" end="00:04:03.744">THE FEDERALLISTS&apos; SAIL SAILS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.744" end="00:04:09.683">&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY SORT OF EDGE INTO THIS, BECAUSE WHEN THE FOUNDERS PUT THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:09.683" end="00:04:10.851">CONSTITUTION INTO OPERATION,</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.851" end="00:04:12.753">THEY DON&apos;T THINK OF PARTIES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.753" end="00:04:16.356">AND IT&apos;S ALMOST AS IF THEY THINK THERE WON&apos;T BE ANY PARTIES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.356" end="00:04:18.759">SO THEY&apos;RE KIND OF SIDE ELLING INTO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.759" end="00:04:24.231">BUT MADISON IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO BREAK OUT OF THAT CA COCOON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.231" end="00:04:26.633">AND HE IS THE ONE THAT COUNTRIES ENS THIS NEW PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.633" end="00:04:29.670">HE CALLS IT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN 1792.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.670" end="00:04:32.072">AND THAT&apos;S THE NAME IT HAS FOR 0 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.072" end="00:04:35.809">AND THEN IT BECOMES THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH IT NOW IS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.809" end="00:04:40.647">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THE FEDERALISTS THEN BECOME THE WIGS OR WHOEVER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.647" end="00:04:41.348">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.348" end="00:04:45.085">THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT MAD SOP TOO, SO HAMILTON FORMS THIS BANK AND MADISON </p>
<p begin="00:04:45.085" end="00:04:48.555">THINKS IT&apos;S UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT IT LASTS FOR 20 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.555" end="00:04:49.223">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.223" end="00:04:53.260">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND HE BECOMES PRESIDENT AND DECIDES, YOU KNOW WHAT, BECAUSE IT LASTS </p>
<p begin="00:04:53.260" end="00:04:56.997">20 YEARS, I GUESS IT&apos;S CONSTITUTIONAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.997" end="00:05:00.400">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S WHAT HE SAYS WHEN HE&apos;S IN HIS RETIREMENT, YOU KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:04.872">SOMEONE ASKS HEM WHY DID YOU SUPPORT THE RECHARTER OF THE FIRST BANK OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.872" end="00:05:09.309">AND HE SAYS WELL THE FACT THAT ITS WITH FOR 20 YEARS AN UNDER BOTH PARTIES, YOU </p>
<p begin="00:05:09.309" end="00:05:13.380">KNOW, THE FEDERALISTS WHO SET IT UP AND THEN WHEN THE REPUBLICANS CAME IN,% </p>
<p begin="00:05:13.380" end="00:05:21.522">JEFFERSON, THEN MADISON, AND NO ONE TRIED TO TEAR IT DOWN AND THAT SIGNIFIED THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:21.522" end="00:05:24.258">NATION&apos;S JUDGEMENT OF ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.258" end="00:05:25.959">NOW HE IS SLICING THIS VERY FINE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.959" end="00:05:30.063">I MEAN HE&apos;S NOT QUITE SAYING I WAS WRONG IN 1791.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.063" end="00:05:32.366">HE&apos;S LEAVING OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT, WELL,</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.366" end="00:05:37.871">MAYBE, MAYBE I WAS RIGHT BUT THEN HE&apos;S ALSO ADMITTING EVERYBODY ELSE MADE A </p>
<p begin="00:05:37.871" end="00:05:44.077">DIFFERENT DECISION SO NOW I&apos;M GOING TO LIVE WITH THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.077" end="00:05:44.645">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S FASCINATING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.645" end="00:05:46.113">YOU YOU READ IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.113" end="00:05:49.850">I LOVE ABOUT THESE BOOKS, IT BRINGS TO LIFE THE CHAOTIC.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.850" end="00:05:53.654">WE ALL SORT OF SOLIDIFIED WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR MINDS BUT IT&apos;S MUCH MORE CAY OT </p>
<p begin="00:05:53.654" end="00:05:55.722">ECK AND MUCH MORE COMPLEX.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.722" end="00:05:57.090">&gt;&gt; CHAOTIC AMBITIOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.090" end="00:05:58.458">YOU TALK ABOUT POLITICS NOW,</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.458" end="00:06:05.265">IF THEY ALL CAME BACK, THEY WOULD SAY YOU CLEANED IT UP.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.265" end="00:06:06.667">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU GUYS ARE DOING GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.667" end="00:06:07.367">SO CIVIL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.367" end="00:06:11.104">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S NOT AS CRAZY, YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S MORE HONEST.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.104" end="00:06:13.273">YOU&apos;VE GOT NONPARTISAN JOURNALISM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.273" end="00:06:14.908">I MEAN THEY WOULD BE AMAZED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.908" end="00:06:18.645">IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE CRAZINESS AND VICIOUSNESS,</p>
