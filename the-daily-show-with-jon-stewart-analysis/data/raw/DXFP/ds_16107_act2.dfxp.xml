<p begin="00:00:03.437" end="00:00:09.543">THE IOWA STRAW POLL ISN&apos;T THE ONLY POLL TO REVEAL SURPRISING RESULTS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.543" end="00:00:11.545">CONGRESS WAS THE SUBJECT OF A RECENT POLL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.545" end="00:00:17.417">FORTUNATELY NO ONE IN THERE APPEARS READY TO FOLLOW PAWLENTY&apos;S LEAD AND BOW OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.417" end="00:00:18.085">SAMANTHA BEE HAS MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.085" end="00:00:21.822">&gt;&gt; Reporter: IN THE WAKE OF THE DEBT CEILING DEBATE CONGRESS HAS REACHED A NEW LOW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.822" end="00:00:26.894">&gt;&gt; CONGRESS&apos;S JOB APPROVAL NUMBER, ACCORDING TO OUR MOST RECENT POLL, IS 14%.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.894" end="00:00:29.296">&gt;&gt; Reporter: 14%.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.296" end="00:00:31.365">WHO THE (BEEP) ARE THESE PEOPLE?</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.365" end="00:00:37.671">THERE&apos;S A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF DENTISTS WHO RECOMMEND SUGARY GUM THAN PEOPLE WHO APPROVE OF CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.671" end="00:00:40.707">I HIT THE STREETS TO FIND ONE OF THESE ELUSIVE APPROVERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.707" end="00:00:44.044">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE SCREWING IT ALL UP.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.044" end="00:00:45.212">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE DOING A TERRIBLE JOB.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.212" end="00:00:51.185">&gt;&gt; I HAVEN&apos;T APPROVED ANYTHING CONGRESS HAS DONE SINCE PERHAPS 1970.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.185" end="00:00:51.952">&gt;&gt; CONGRESS STINKS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.952" end="00:00:56.023">&gt;&gt; Reporter: STATISTICALLY THERE HAD TO BE SOMEONE WHO APPROVED OF CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.023" end="00:00:56.657">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.657" end="00:00:57.424">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.424" end="00:00:58.659">&gt;&gt; NO, NOT AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.659" end="00:01:00.260">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.260" end="00:01:01.061">&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.061" end="00:01:02.896">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.896" end="00:01:04.064">YES, I DO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.064" end="00:01:06.433">&gt;&gt; Reporter: AND THERE HE WAS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.433" end="00:01:09.736">AN ACTUAL 14%ER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.736" end="00:01:11.572">JAMES SCHMOOL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.572" end="00:01:13.340">&gt;&gt; I TOTALLY APPROVE OF CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.340" end="00:01:16.543">I HAVE FULL FAITH IN THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.543" end="00:01:19.146">&gt;&gt; Reporter: ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT CONGRESS IS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.146" end="00:01:19.813">&gt;&gt; YES, I AM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.813" end="00:01:23.083">&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU KNOW THAT CONGRESS ISN&apos;T A WATER SKIING SQUIRREL, RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.083" end="00:01:27.321">&gt;&gt; LOOK, THIS IS THE 112th CONGRESS THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS HAD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.321" end="00:01:29.656">I THINK THEY&apos;RE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.656" end="00:01:30.390">&gt;&gt; Reporter: OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.390" end="00:01:35.295">DO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS CONGRESS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.295" end="00:01:36.263">&gt;&gt; STOP IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.263" end="00:01:40.367">&gt;&gt; Reporter: BECAUSE IT&apos;S ITS APPROVAL RATING NEVER GOES DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.367" end="00:01:42.736">HE JUST WASN&apos;T GETTING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.736" end="00:01:45.339">WHO WON THE DEBT CEILING NEGOTIATIONS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.339" end="00:01:47.941">&gt;&gt; BOTH SIDES WON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.941" end="00:01:50.444">AND THE PUBLIC WON TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.444" end="00:01:53.514">&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU ARE BLOWING MY MIND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.514" end="00:01:54.648">&gt;&gt; GET USED TO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.648" end="00:01:55.949">&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT I COULDN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.949" end="00:02:00.053">I HAD NEVER MET ANYBODY SO EXOTIC.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.053" end="00:02:02.189">WAS THERE ANYTHING HE DIDN&apos;T LIKE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.189" end="00:02:08.061">WHAT DOES THE WORLD LOOK LIKE THROUGH SCHMOOL-COLORED GLASSES?</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.061" end="00:02:08.929">DO YOU LIKE THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.929" end="00:02:12.499">DO YOU LIKE BEING JAMMED INTO A TAXI CAB STRUCK IN TRAFFIC?</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.499" end="00:02:13.567">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T MIND IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.567" end="00:02:14.201">I&apos;M USED TO IT.</p>

<p begin="00:02:53.140" end="00:02:59.580">WE SUBJECTED HIM TO A BATTERY OF TESTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.580" end="00:03:01.548">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT ON THIS SCAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.548" end="00:03:05.319">IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HE&apos;S BEEN INJURED AT ALL.</p>
