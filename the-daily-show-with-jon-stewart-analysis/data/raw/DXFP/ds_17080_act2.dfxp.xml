<p begin="00:00:29.129" end="00:00:33.200">LAWMAKERS HAVE FOUND THE SOLUTION TO THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FACING THEIR SCHOOLS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.200" end="00:00:38.605">&gt;&gt; ARIZONA&apos;S GOVERNOR JAN BREWER JUST APPROVED A BILL BANNING ETHNIC STUDIES CLASSES </p>
<p begin="00:00:38.605" end="00:00:39.773">IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</p>

<p begin="00:00:48.649" end="00:00:53.353">&gt;&gt; MY CONCERN WAS A LOT OF THE RADICAL IDEAS THAT THEY WERE TEACHING IN THESE CLASSES </p>
<p begin="00:00:53.353" end="00:00:56.757">TELLING THESE KIDS THAT THIS IS THEIR LAND.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.757" end="00:00:58.392">THE WHITES TOOK IT OVER.</p>

<p begin="00:01:41.902" end="00:01:44.505">&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU DO THAT BY TEACHING THEM TO HATE WHITE PEOPLE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.505" end="00:01:47.007">&gt;&gt; WE DON&apos;T TEACH THEM TO HATE WHITE PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.007" end="00:01:52.379">WHAT WE&apos;RE TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE A MORE COMPLEX VERSION OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR </p>

<p begin="00:02:11.064" end="00:02:12.065">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.065" end="00:02:19.706">WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT BUILDS A... MORE OF A BOND BETWEEN THE TEACHER AND THE STUDENT.</p>

<p begin="00:02:27.881" end="00:02:31.785">&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD GIVING FOOD TO OUR YOUTH BE SOMETHING THAT IS FROWNED UPON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.785" end="00:02:36.657">&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHEN THE PROGRAM GOES AWAY, THE DORITOS GO AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.657" end="00:02:39.826">WHY THESE KIDS ARE UPSET.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.826" end="00:02:41.195">&gt;&gt; PRETTY OFFENSEIVE.</p>

<p begin="00:02:45.432" end="00:02:48.235">SCHOOLS, THEY CAN FOCUS ON OTHER ETHNICITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.235" end="00:02:53.574">&gt;&gt; HONESTLY, THIS LAW WON&apos;T BE APPLIED TO ANY OTHER OF OUR COURSES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.574" end="00:03:00.547">IT WAS STRICTLY WRITTEN FOR ONE COURSE WHICH IS THE MEXICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES PROGRAM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.547" end="00:03:05.752">NOBODY HAS COMPLAINED ABOUT ANY OF THE PAN-ASIAN OR OTHER COURSES THAT ARE BEING TAUGHT.</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.056" end="00:03:12.826">&gt;&gt; THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES PROGRAM IS STILL THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.826" end="00:03:18.098">IT&apos;S NOT TEACHING THE RESENTMENT OF A GREATER CLASS OF PEOPLE.</p>

<p begin="00:04:03.911" end="00:04:07.214">WE WERE LIKE SORT OF A HALF OR THREE-FIFTHS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.214" end="00:04:12.052">&gt;&gt; MY PERSONAL PERCEPTION OF IT, I WOULD SAY YOU WERE PROBABLY A QUARTER.</p>

<p begin="00:04:14.454" end="00:04:18.058">THE MORE I REALIZED ARIZONA HAS FIGURED OUT THE RIGHT WAY TO TEACH IT.</p>

<p begin="00:04:51.658" end="00:04:56.096">UNTIL THEN, ARIZONA&apos;S CHILDREN CAN COUNT ON PROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS LIKE MICHAEL HICKS </p>
<p begin="00:04:56.096" end="00:04:57.764">TO PROTECT THEM.</p>
