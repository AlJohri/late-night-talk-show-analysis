<p begin="00:01:16.276" end="00:01:21.582">IT WAS REALLY MY EXPERIENCE AS A MOTHER TRYING TO GET MY KIDS TO EAT WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.582" end="00:01:27.254">YOU KNOW WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON&apos;T KNOW WE&apos;RE SEEING AN EPIDEMIC OF CHILDHOOD OBESITY.</p>

<p begin="00:02:20.674" end="00:02:24.077">&gt;&gt; NO, NO, GO THE OTHER WAY AROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.077" end="00:02:28.782">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE USED TO -- IN THE OLD DAYS THEY OPENED THE BACK DOOR, YOU WENT OUT AND YOU RAN.</p>

<p begin="00:02:30.350" end="00:02:33.587">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A DIFFERENT WORLD, YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.587" end="00:02:35.923">WITH MODERN LIFE THINS ARE CHANGING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.923" end="00:02:40.260">MANY KIDS ARE LIVING IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEIR PARENTS DON&apos;T FEEL SAFE HAVING THEM RUN </p>
<p begin="00:02:40.260" end="00:02:41.094">OUTSIDE, RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.094" end="00:02:41.862">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.862" end="00:02:47.768">&gt;&gt; FAST FOOD IS THE EXCEPTION -- THE RULE RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.768" end="00:02:49.269">JUST CULTURALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.269" end="00:02:51.104">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S CHEAPER SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.104" end="00:02:56.443">TRYING TO FEED POWER TO PEOPLE A DOLLAR MENU WITH GOOD FOOD ON IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.443" end="00:03:02.583">IS THIS FOR YOU MORE OF A SYMBOLIC IDEA THAT THEY START TO UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND?</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.583" end="00:03:04.885">&gt;&gt; THE GARDEN IS THE WAY TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.885" end="00:03:14.928">I LEARNED IN CHANGING MY KIDS HABITS, IF THEY ARE INVOLVED IN THE GROWING PROCESS OF FOOD AND </p>
<p begin="00:03:14.928" end="00:03:18.465">THEY GET A SENSE OF WHERE IT COMES FROM AND THEY ARE ENGAGED,</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.465" end="00:03:20.100">THEY TEND TO BE EXCITED ABOUT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.100" end="00:03:23.704">THE GARDEN IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CATALYST FOR THAT DISCUSSION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.704" end="00:03:28.275">WE&apos;VE HAD HUNDREDS OF KIDS WORKING WITH US IN THE GUARD TON HELP PLANT AND HARVEST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.275" end="00:03:32.079">USUALLY WITH THE HARVEST WE END WITH A VEGETABLE FEAST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.079" end="00:03:34.147">WE&apos;VE GOT KIDS WHO -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:34.147" end="00:03:37.784">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE PHRASE VEGETABLE FEAST -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:37.784" end="00:03:40.888">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A FEAST!</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.888" end="00:03:45.125">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THERE A CHEESE FAUCET FOR THIS VEGETABLE FEAST?</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.125" end="00:03:51.265">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;VE SERVED EVERYTHING FROM FLAT BREAD VEGGIE PIZZA THAT </p>
<p begin="00:03:51.265" end="00:03:54.101">MANY KIDS SAID IS BETTER THAN TAKEOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.101" end="00:04:00.040">BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THAT VEGETABLES GROWN FRESH TASTE BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.040" end="00:04:07.347">I KNOW YOU GOT THOSE STORE BOUGHT TOMATOES IN THE PLASTIC TIN THAT TASTED LIKE WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.347" end="00:04:15.522">&gt;&gt; Jon: OR THE BOIL IN THE BAG IN THE CRAZY YELLOW SAUCE THAT SHE SAID IS SAY BUTTERRISH SUBSTANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.522" end="00:04:20.060">&gt;&gt; YOU COOKED BROCCOLI UNTIL YOU COULD CUT WIT A FORK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.060" end="00:04:21.695">IT&apos;S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.695" end="00:04:26.733">WHEN YOU GET KIDS ENGAGED IN PULLING A TOMATO OFF THE VINE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.733" end="00:04:29.203">&gt;&gt; Jon: ENGAGE YOUR CHILDREN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.203" end="00:04:30.838">&gt;&gt; IN THE PROCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.838" end="00:04:33.974">&gt;&gt; Jon: TALK TO THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.974" end="00:04:35.676">DO NOT LEAVE THEM OUTSIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.676" end="00:04:36.376">CAN YOU STICK AROUND?</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.376" end="00:04:38.712">GO TO COMMERCIAL AND WE&apos;LL COME BACK FOR MORE.</p>
