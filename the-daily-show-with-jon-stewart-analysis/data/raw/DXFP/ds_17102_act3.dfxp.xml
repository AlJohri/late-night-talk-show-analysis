<p begin="00:01:36.463" end="00:01:39.900">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S AN EXTRAORDINARY PRIVILEGE AND IT&apos;S A WONDERFUL PLACE TO BE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.900" end="00:01:41.101">THE ABBEY IS SO EXTRAORDINARY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.101" end="00:01:46.440">I WAS DOING A JOB FOR THE CHURCH BEFOREHAND AND THEN I HAD A PHONE CALL SAYING COULD I GO TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:46.440" end="00:01:50.410">TEN DOWNING STREET AND THERE WAS A LETTER FROM THE PRIME MINISTER AND HE WAS GOING TO REMY NAME TO </p>

<p begin="00:01:58.185" end="00:02:00.354">&quot;BE AT 10 DOWNING STREET&quot; AND YOU DON&apos;T KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.354" end="00:02:02.055">&gt;&gt; I DIDN&apos;T KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.055" end="00:02:06.660">I HAD TO GO TO DOWNING STREET AND I WAS HANDED A LETTER FROM THE PRIME MINISTER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.660" end="00:02:10.931">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU COULD HAVE OPENED IT UP AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN LIKE &quot;HEY, YOU&apos;RE </p>

<p begin="00:02:18.172" end="00:02:18.672">&gt;&gt; I DO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.672" end="00:02:21.742">THE DEANERY IS A 14th CENTURY HOUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.742" end="00:02:22.409">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH!</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.145" end="00:02:26.480">SO YOU HAVE NO HEAT...</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:27.748">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.748" end="00:02:28.982">OR PLUMBING OR ANYTHING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.982" end="00:02:35.889">&gt;&gt; YES, IT&apos;S BEEN MODERNIZED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.889" end="00:02:42.162">THE HITLER AIRPORTS HAD AN BIT OF IMPACT ON US IN 1941 SO THEY DID SOME UPDATING WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.162" end="00:02:48.135">BUT AT ONE END OF THE DEANERY I LOOK OVER THE ABBEY SO I&apos;M THERE LOOKING THROUGH INTO THE WEST </p>
<p begin="00:02:48.135" end="00:02:49.536">END OF THE KNAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.536" end="00:02:50.871">SO IT&apos;S AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE TO BE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.871" end="00:02:51.972">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT AN INCREDIBLE...</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.972" end="00:02:59.112">DO YOU FEEL THE SPIRIT OF... FOR AMERICANS OUR HISTORY IS FOR US 240 YEARS, WHATEVER, AND WE FEEL </p>

<p begin="00:03:11.525" end="00:03:12.526">GREAT, GREAT GRANDFATHER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.526" end="00:03:17.364">&gt;&gt; WE LOOK BACK TO 960 AND WE HAVE THE WHOLE OF THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.364" end="00:03:20.701">AS BARACK OBAMA SAID TO ME WHEN HE CAME TO THE ABBEY IN MAY LAST YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.701" end="00:03:25.672">I ASKED HIM WHY DO SO MANY AMERICANS... SO MANY AMERICANS COME TO THE ABBEY, WHAT IS IT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.672" end="00:03:31.945">AND HE SAID WELL, THEY&apos;RE LOOKING FOR THEIR ROOTS AND YOU CAN TELL THE WHOLE STORY OF THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:31.945" end="00:03:35.082">ENGLISH SPEAKING WORLD NOT JUST THROUGH THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE COMMON WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.082" end="00:03:40.954">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE DIDN&apos;T TELL YOU THAT MOSTLY IT&apos;S JUST BECAUSE IT&apos;S ON THE TOUR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.954" end="00:03:44.458">(LAUGHTER) THE ROOTS THING, YES, THAT&apos;S VERY SOPHISTICATED ANSWER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.458" end="00:03:48.228">MOST OF US WOULD BE LIKE &quot;WE WERE WALKING BY AND...</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.228" end="00:03:48.629">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.629" end="00:03:54.701">&gt;&gt; WE HAVE AN AMBITION WHICH IS THAT OUR VISITORS, OUR TOURIST WILL BECOME PILGRIMS WHILE </p>
<p begin="00:03:54.701" end="00:03:55.335">THEY&apos;RE THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.335" end="00:03:59.506">THAT THEY&apos;LL FIND SOMETHING OF GOD THERE THAT WHICH WILL INSPIRE THEM AND UPLIFT THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.506" end="00:04:02.543">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S VERY DIFFICULT TO WALK INTO A HOUSE OF WORSHIP,</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.543" end="00:04:11.818">ESPECIALLY ONE THAT HAS WITHSTOOD THE TEST OF TIME, AND NOT FEEL SOME SENSE OF AWE OR A </p>
<p begin="00:04:11.818" end="00:04:14.488">SENSE OF WHAT THE PEOPLE THERE EXPERIENCE SOD MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.488" end="00:04:20.761">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S SO MUCH HISTORY AND THERE AND SO MANY PEOPLE BURIED AND MEMORIALIZED THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.761" end="00:04:25.732">EVERYWHERE YOU GO THERE ARE POETS AND SCIENTISTS AND WRITERS, CHARLES DARWIN, CHARLES </p>
<p begin="00:04:25.732" end="00:04:28.969">DICKENS, SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND YOU HAVE A SENSE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN GREAT AND </p>
<p begin="00:04:28.969" end="00:04:36.176">MADE A DIFFERENCE TO OUR LIFE AND WE&apos;RE SURROUNDED BY THAT MEMORY AS WELL AS BEING SHOT </p>
<p begin="00:04:36.176" end="00:04:38.078">THROUGH TO THE E INTERNAL MEMORY AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.078" end="00:04:42.850">AND WHAT REALLY IS IMPORTANT FOR US.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.850" end="00:04:47.120">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU FIND YOURSELF WANDERING AMONGST THOSE NAMES OCCASIONALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:48.889">I JUST IMAGINE LOOKING FOR INSPIRATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.889" end="00:04:51.158">THOSE ARE WONDERFUL PLACES TO BE TO...</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.158" end="00:04:52.793">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S COMPLETELY EXTRAORDINARY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.793" end="00:04:58.732">THE FIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING OF PRINCE WILLIAM AND CATHERINE...</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.732" end="00:05:00.868">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, I DIDN&apos;T KNOW THEY GOT MARRIED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.868" end="00:05:02.402">THAT&apos;S WONDERFUL THAT HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.402" end="00:05:02.803">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:02.803" end="00:05:06.406">&gt;&gt; IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY EVENT AND THE NIGHT BEFORE IT I WAS WANDERING THROUGH THE ROYAL </p>
<p begin="00:05:06.406" end="00:05:10.043">CHAPELS AND I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS AND I WAS PRAYING FOR THEM AND HOPING THEY WERE GOING </p>
<p begin="00:05:10.043" end="00:05:15.616">TO BE FINE AND I JUST FELT THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE PLACE AND THE WARMTH OF THE ABBEY AS IF IT </p>
<p begin="00:05:15.616" end="00:05:17.618">WERE RISING UP AND SUPPORTING THEM AND ME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.618" end="00:05:20.387">IT WAS A PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.387" end="00:05:22.856">&gt;&gt; Jon: VERY, VERY NICE AND LOVELY TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.856" end="00:05:23.290">LAST QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.290" end="00:05:27.661">THE QUEEN, BECAUSE YOU WORK FOR HER, YOU&apos;RE A ROYAL PECULIAR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.661" end="00:05:31.064">WHEN SHE GREETS YOU...</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.064" end="00:05:31.431">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.431" end="00:05:35.135">DOES IT SOUND LIKE THIS IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM?</p>
