<p begin="00:00:04.304" end="00:00:06.840">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.840" end="00:00:11.678">SO HEALTH CARE IS NOT THE ONLY LIFE-AND-DEATH ISSUE THAT HAS AMERICA DEEPLY DIVIDED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.678" end="00:00:16.817">&gt;&gt; 65% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD DO A BETTER JOB OF FENDING OFF </p>
<p begin="00:00:16.817" end="00:00:19.920">ALIEN INVASION THAN WOULD MITT ROMNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:21.221">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:00:21.221" end="00:00:25.025">&gt;&gt; Jon: PERHAPS MR. ROMNEY DOES NOT WANT TO FIGHT HIS OWN KIND.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.025" end="00:00:35.636">(LAUGHTER) BUT I BELIEVE A FICTIONAL SCENARIO DESERVES A FICTIONAL PRESIDENT, QUITE FRANKLY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.636" end="00:00:42.276">AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT FRICTIONAL PRESIDENT IS NEITHER OBAMA NOR ROMNEY BUT HERMAN CAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.276" end="00:00:46.046">&gt;&gt; ARE YOU PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.046" end="00:00:48.081">EARTH IS BEING ATTACKED BY ALIENS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.081" end="00:00:50.517">LOOK INTO THAT CAMERA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.517" end="00:00:52.152">AND ACTION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.152" end="00:00:59.660">&gt;&gt; CITIZENS OF EARTH, IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF HUMANITY THAT BUILT THIS PLANET.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.660" end="00:01:08.902">IT IS THAT SAME SPIRIT OF HUMANITY THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DESTROY THE ALIENS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.902" end="00:01:15.642">(APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.642" end="00:01:16.376">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT WAS AWESOME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.376" end="00:01:22.149">(LAUGHTER) AND MR. CAIN GAVE THAT SPEECH OFF THE TOP OF HIS HEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.149" end="00:01:22.482">TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.482" end="00:01:27.955">SO WHEN HERMAN CAIN ENDED HIS PRESIDENTIAL RUN AN ALIEN INVASION WAS NOT 9 ONLY MOMENT OF CRISIS WE </p>
<p begin="00:01:27.955" end="00:01:30.324">LOST A CHANCE TO SEE HIM RESPOND TO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.324" end="00:01:31.692">MANY, MANY OTHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.692" end="00:01:36.797">THEY ARE THE SUBJECT OF A NEW SERIES, A NEW SERIES OF JOHN OLIVER&apos;S INTERVIEWS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.797" end="00:01:42.169">HERMAN CAIN AN AMERICAN PRESIDENCY.</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.327" end="00:02:09.696">TONIGHT THE CONSTITUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.696" end="00:02:16.870">&gt;&gt; I LOVE THE CONSTITUTION AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.870" end="00:02:22.075">WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE BIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.075" end="00:02:23.076">&gt;&gt; HANDS DOWN, THE BIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.076" end="00:02:24.878">&gt;&gt; THE BIBLE WOULD BEAT THE CONSTITUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.878" end="00:02:25.445">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.445" end="00:02:28.182">NO QUESTION, IT WOULDN&apos;T EVEN BE A CONTEST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.182" end="00:02:31.785">&gt;&gt; REALLY, THE CONSTITUTION WOULDN&apos;T EVEN GET IN A COUPLE OF BLOWS JUST BY LAW </p>
<p begin="00:02:31.785" end="00:02:32.619">OF AVERAGES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.619" end="00:02:33.086">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.086" end="00:02:37.457">&gt;&gt; WOULD THE BIBLE KNOW WHEN TO STOP PUNCHING OR WOULD HE HAVE TO PULL IT OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.457" end="00:02:39.493">&gt;&gt; THE BIBLE WOULD KNOW WHEN TO STOP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.493" end="00:02:43.163">&gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION, SIR?</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.163" end="00:02:52.773">&gt;&gt; I WOULD BE WILLING TO USE MY POWER AS PRESIDENT TO CALL OUR MILITARY INTO </p>
<p begin="00:02:52.773" end="00:02:54.808">ACTION IF NECESSARY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.808" end="00:02:56.844">&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO KILL FOR IT, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.844" end="00:02:59.279">&gt;&gt; YES, I WOULD.</p>
