<p begin="00:00:04.738" end="00:00:08.976">MY GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER CHAIR OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, HE&apos;S CURRENTLY </p>
<p begin="00:00:08.976" end="00:00:11.512">POLITICAL ANALYST FOR MSNBC,</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.512" end="00:00:15.349">PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM MICHAEL STEELE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.349" end="00:00:15.749">[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.749" end="00:00:19.186">SIR, NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.186" end="00:00:20.220">NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:21.889">&gt;&gt; GOOD TO BE HERE, MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.889" end="00:00:23.223">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.223" end="00:00:26.894">THE PUPPET WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO BOOK THIS TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.894" end="00:00:29.263">GETTING YOU HERE IS MUCH PREFERABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.263" end="00:00:32.065">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A LOT EASIER, BUT HE SENDS HIS BEST.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.065" end="00:00:34.134">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DID NOT REALIZE THAT YOU WERE HANGING OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.134" end="00:00:35.502">&gt;&gt; I LEFT HIM ON THE CHAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.502" end="00:00:37.938">HE WAS HAVING A LATTE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.938" end="00:00:40.541">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DIDN&apos;T KNOW HE WAS A LIBERAL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.541" end="00:00:42.376">A LATTE?</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.376" end="00:00:42.709">REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.709" end="00:00:44.278">&gt;&gt; WE KIND OF BALANCE EACH OTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.278" end="00:00:45.479">&gt;&gt; Jon: I UNDERSTAND.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.479" end="00:00:49.816">SO HOW ARE YOU... ARE YOU FEELING A WEIGHT OFF YOUR SHOULDERS TO NOT BE THE RNC </p>
<p begin="00:00:49.816" end="00:00:56.256">CHAIR DURING THIS TIME OF TUMULT WITH ALL THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES?</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.256" end="00:00:56.790">HOW DO YOU FEEL?</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.790" end="00:01:02.062">&gt;&gt; I FEEL GOOD TO HAVE THE WEIGHT OFF, BUT I REALLY LIKE THE ENGAGEMENT AND WOULD LIKE TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:02.062" end="00:01:05.065">BE A PART OF MAKING SURE THAT WE PUT FORTH THE BEST CANDIDATE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.065" end="00:01:09.503">THE BEST FOOT, THE BEST MESSAGE TO GO TOE TO TOE AND HAVE THE FOLKS OUT THERE MAKE A CHOICE </p>
<p begin="00:01:09.503" end="00:01:11.705">NEXT YEAR BECAUSE THAT&apos;S WHAT IT BOILS DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.705" end="00:01:15.209">TO IT&apos;S REALLY PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES TACT DIRECTION THE COUNTRY GOES NEXT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.209" end="00:01:20.347">IS IT ONE THAT IS CENTERED AROUND A GOVERNMENT ORYENGTDED STRATEGY OR ONE THAT&apos;S A PRIVATE </p>
<p begin="00:01:20.347" end="00:01:24.585">SECTOR STRATEGY OR IS THERE A HYBRID THERE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH?</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.585" end="00:01:25.319">&gt;&gt; Jon: A HYBRID?</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.319" end="00:01:26.420">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.420" end="00:01:26.987">IMAGINE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.987" end="00:01:28.956">&gt;&gt; Jon: SOME KIND OF... NOW,</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.956" end="00:01:31.458">APPARENTLY THE HYBRID, THOUGH,</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.458" end="00:01:32.292">IS UNACCEPTABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.292" end="00:01:38.932">IS THERE ANYONE IN THE REPUBLICAN FIELD THAT WOULD ALLOW A HYBRID BECAUSE APPARENTLY ANY TYPE OF </p>
<p begin="00:01:38.932" end="00:01:43.670">PRIVATE-PUBLIC HYBRID, MUCH LIKE STEM CELLS, IS...</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.670" end="00:01:47.541">&gt;&gt; THE REALITY IS COVER FINANCE IS ABOUT CREATING THOSE HYBRIDS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.541" end="00:01:51.144">THOSE MOMENTS WHERE YOU TAKE THE PHILOSOPHY AND THE REALITY AND MERGE THEM TOGETHER THROUGH A </p>
<p begin="00:01:51.144" end="00:01:54.982">POLICY THAT DOES WHAT YOU HOPE WILL BE THE BEST THING FOR THE PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.982" end="00:01:57.551">I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF IT...</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.551" end="00:02:00.454">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN DO YOU THINK THEY&apos;LL THEN GOVERN IN REALITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.454" end="00:02:01.822">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S THE QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.822" end="00:02:02.689">WE&apos;RE STILL WAITING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.689" end="00:02:03.790">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.790" end="00:02:04.191">FAIR ENOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.191" end="00:02:06.393">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE STILL WAITING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.393" end="00:02:07.361">REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.361" end="00:02:11.231">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE REPUBLICANS SEEM ANXIOUS TO JUST KEEP GETTING MORE PEOPLE IN THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.231" end="00:02:14.268">YOU KNOW, BOSTON HAD THIS BIG WEEKEND.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.268" end="00:02:17.504">RICK PERRY, EVERYONE WAS ALL EXCITED TO HAVE HIM THERE THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.504" end="00:02:20.073">THEY&apos;RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT PAUL RYAN AND CHRIS CHRISTIE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.073" end="00:02:22.843">&gt;&gt; CAN WE STOP THE NOISE ON THAT ALREADY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.843" end="00:02:23.977">THE REALITY IS THIS FIELD IS SET.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.977" end="00:02:24.912">YOU HAVE THE TOP TIER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.912" end="00:02:29.149">HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD THAT TERM IN THE PAST WEEK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.149" end="00:02:31.685">BUT YOU HAVE THE THREE FOLKS THAT WILL BE LEADING THE CHARGE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.685" end="00:02:37.958">YOU HAVE HERMAN CAIN AND NEWT GINGRICH, WHO I THINK DID HIMSELF REALLY WELL IN THE LAST </p>
<p begin="00:02:37.958" end="00:02:40.194">DEBATE IN TERMS OF LAYING OUT SOME POLICY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.194" end="00:02:42.429">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO NEWT GINGRICH IS STILL RUNING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.429" end="00:02:44.831">&gt;&gt; HE&apos;S STILL RUNNING, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.831" end="00:02:46.300">HE&apos;S STILL RUNNING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.300" end="00:02:49.803">BUT I THINK THIS CONVERSATION BY A LOT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT TYPE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.803" end="00:02:51.305">PARTICULARLY IN WASHINGTON...</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.305" end="00:02:53.507">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.507" end="00:02:58.512">&gt;&gt; KARL ROVE OR THE &quot;WALL STREET JOURNAL,&quot; THEY NEED TO CUT THAT NOISE OUT...</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.512" end="00:02:59.580">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY&apos;RE NOT SATISFIED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.580" end="00:03:00.380">&gt;&gt; TOO BAD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.380" end="00:03:01.215">GET OVER IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.215" end="00:03:03.917">THE REALITY IS THESE ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE GOING TO BE RUNNING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.917" end="00:03:07.287">ALL THOSE OTHER INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GOING TO GET INTO THIS RACE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THEY HAVE </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.287" end="00:03:10.657">TO GET ON THE BALL YACHT IN 50 STATES, AND THAT&apos;S A PROCESS THAT TAKES TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.657" end="00:03:11.625">THEY HAVE TO RAISE MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.625" end="00:03:16.730">THEY HAVE TO PUT THE ORGANIZATION IN PLACE, AND IF THEY HAVEN&apos;T DONE IT BY NOW,</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.730" end="00:03:18.131">PARTICULARLY WITH PERRY,</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.131" end="00:03:20.067">BACHMANN AND ROMNEY, IT&apos;S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.067" end="00:03:22.603">VAUGHN JON FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO,</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.603" end="00:03:28.075">AND I&apos;M NOT AN ELECTION LAW SPECIALIST OR LITIGATOR, BUT APPARENTLY IF YOU HAVE A ONE </p>
<p begin="00:03:28.075" end="00:03:34.248">NATION BUS AND YOU&apos;RE SARAH PALIN, YOU&apos;RE ALLOWED TO JUST DRIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.248" end="00:03:38.785">EVEN ON INAUGURATION DAY, JUST DRIVE RIGHT IN AND SAY, I&apos;LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.785" end="00:03:40.120">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.120" end="00:03:41.488">&gt;&gt; Jon: FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.488" end="00:03:44.224">&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.224" end="00:03:45.726">&gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED KARL ROVE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.726" end="00:03:46.994">THAT&apos;S A VERY INTERESTING THING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.994" end="00:03:54.535">FOR MANY YEARS KARL ROVE WAS A SACRED HOLY MAN IN THE REPUBLICAN...</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.535" end="00:03:55.002">&gt;&gt; REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.002" end="00:03:57.404">&gt;&gt; DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION...</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.404" end="00:03:58.539">&gt;&gt; NOT MY HOLY MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.539" end="00:03:59.640">WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.640" end="00:04:04.444">&gt;&gt; Jon: I THOUGHT HE WAS CONSIDERED THE... THEY REFERRED TO HIM AS THE ARCHITECT OF THE...</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.444" end="00:04:05.512">&gt;&gt; IS THAT REALLY IT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.512" end="00:04:11.051">&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT ARE... WHY DO YOU THINK HE IS NOT FINDING THESE CANDIDATES ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE </p>
<p begin="00:04:11.051" end="00:04:16.590">THEY SEEM TO BE UTILIZING STRATEGIES AND POLICIES THAT HE WOULD APPROVE OF?</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.590" end="00:04:18.058">&gt;&gt; YOU WOULD THINK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.058" end="00:04:21.895">BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE RICK PERRY,</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.895" end="00:04:24.064">WHO HAS REALLY COME OUT OF THE GATES STRONG.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.064" end="00:04:24.865">YOU CAN&apos;T CONTROL HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.865" end="00:04:27.668">HE HAS HIS OWN SET OF IDEAS, HIS OWN WAY OF DOING HIS THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.668" end="00:04:31.705">YOU CANNOT PUT HIM IN THE BOX AND SAY, OKAY RUSSIA YOU GOING TO DO IT THIS WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.705" end="00:04:32.840">AND WE, THE ESTABLISHMENT,</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.840" end="00:04:33.907">WHOEVER THEY HAPPEN TO BE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.907" end="00:04:34.374">APPROVE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.374" end="00:04:36.476">THE SAME WITH THE SARAH PALIN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.476" end="00:04:38.178">YOU NOTICE, YOU CAN ALWAYS...</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.178" end="00:04:42.816">&gt;&gt; Jon: I LIKE HOW YOU REFER TO IT AS &quot;THE SARAH PALIN.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:04:42.816" end="00:04:44.818">SHE&apos;S JUST A NOUN AT THIS POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.818" end="00:04:46.119">&gt;&gt; SHE IS ALSO A GOOD FRIEND.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.119" end="00:04:49.256">SHE&apos;S A GOOD LADY, BUT SHE&apos;S NOT... I DON&apos;T THINK SHE&apos;S RUNNING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.256" end="00:04:53.727">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU THINK THE ISSUE THERE IS KARL ROVE WOULD LIKE TO </p>
<p begin="00:04:53.727" end="00:04:55.996">FEEL... IS THAT AN EGO SITUATION OR IS THAT MONEY?</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.996" end="00:04:59.900">AS THE RNC CHAIR, ROVE HAS THIS CROSSROADS GPS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.900" end="00:05:01.535">WHERE DOES HE GET HIS MONEY FROM?</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.535" end="00:05:03.036">&gt;&gt; FROM RNC DONORS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.036" end="00:05:04.872">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT THE CONFLICT NOW?</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.872" end="00:05:11.144">&gt;&gt; WELL, IT&apos;S NOT... WELL, IT WAS A CONFLICT WHEN I WAS CHAIRMAN AND CERTAINLY BUT IT </p>
<p begin="00:05:11.144" end="00:05:17.150">ISN&apos;T NOW BECAUSE EVERYONE IS KIND OF BACK TO STATUS QUO, THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE I CAME IN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.150" end="00:05:18.519">&gt;&gt; YOU GOT MUSCLED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.519" end="00:05:21.555">&gt;&gt; I GOT MUSCLED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT, BUT I DID MY THING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.555" end="00:05:23.557">I WON THE 63 HOUSE SEATS THEY NEEDED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.557" end="00:05:28.662">I PICKED UP 600 STATE LEGISLATIVE RACES AND WE RAISED A LOT OF MONEY AND WON.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.662" end="00:05:30.230">SO DON&apos;T SCREW IT UP, YOU KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.230" end="00:05:35.869">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THIS NOW A CHANGING OF THE REPUBLICAN GUARD IF RICK PERRY BECOMES THE NOMINEE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.869" end="00:05:38.272">&gt;&gt; A VERY DIFFERENT GROUP OF PEOPLE COMING IN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.272" end="00:05:41.608">&gt;&gt; Jon: DOES KARL ROVE MAKE HIMSELF AVAILABLE TO MR. PERRY?</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.608" end="00:05:45.212">&gt;&gt; THAT WILL HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.212" end="00:05:46.446">NO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.446" end="00:05:46.813">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.813" end="00:05:49.216">THE REALITY...</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.216" end="00:05:52.853">&gt;&gt; Jon: ANSWER THIS QUESTION AS YOU WOULD HAVE WHEN YOU WERE STILL RNC CHAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.853" end="00:05:54.955">I JUST WANT TO HEAR THE DIFFERENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.955" end="00:05:57.491">JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT, THE DIFFERENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.491" end="00:06:00.260">[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.260" end="00:06:05.265">&gt;&gt; AS RNC CHAIRMAN I WOULD HAVE SAID, YEAH, IN SOMEONE ELSE&apos;S LIFETIME.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.265" end="00:06:07.234">&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.234" end="00:06:10.904">&gt;&gt; I MEAN, THAT&apos;S THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.904" end="00:06:17.044">EVERYONE KNOWS AND THE HISTORY IS WELCOME TOED OF THE STRESS AND STRAIN BETWEEN THE BUSH-ROVE </p>
<p begin="00:06:17.044" end="00:06:24.618">CAMP AND THE PERRY CAMP, EVEN THOUGH BUSH ENCOURAGED THEN- DEMOCRAT PERRY TO SWITCH PARTIES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.618" end="00:06:27.955">BUT IT WAS MATTER OF ONCE HE DID, THAT ONCE HE GOT INTO CAMP,</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.955" end="00:06:29.790">HE&apos;S LIKE, I GOT MY OWN THING,</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.790" end="00:06:30.924">I&apos;M DOING MY OWN THING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.924" end="00:06:32.593">THAT&apos;S TRUE WITH A LOT OF THESE FOLKS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.593" end="00:06:37.064">AND I THINK THE REALITY IS THE PARTY IS CHANGING AND IT&apos;S BEEN CHANGING GOING BACK NOT TO THE </p>
<p begin="00:06:37.064" end="00:06:42.269">LAST TWO YEARS OR SO, BACK TO 2005, 2004 IT&apos;S BEEN CHANGING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.269" end="00:06:43.837">&gt;&gt; Jon: BACK TO THE 1850s.</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.837" end="00:06:47.808">&gt;&gt; BACK TO THE 1850s.</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.808" end="00:06:49.643">&gt;&gt; Jon: MOVES IN A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION.</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.643" end="00:06:50.644">&gt;&gt; VERY DIFFERENT PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.644" end="00:06:52.379">THEN IT WAS MORE ABOUT INDIVIDUALS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.379" end="00:06:56.116">TODAY IT&apos;S MORE ABOUT INSTITUTIONS AND BIG-GOVERNMENT REPUBLICANISM IS WHY YOU SAW THE </p>
<p begin="00:06:56.116" end="00:06:59.119">FORMATION OF A TEA PARTY STRATEGY EMERGE AROUND THE COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.119" end="00:07:01.688">I THINK YOU&apos;LL SEE THE SAME THING ON THE LEFT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.688" end="00:07:06.827">WITH THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT TAKING HOLD AS IT BEGAN TO DO IN WISCONSIN EARLIER THIS YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.827" end="00:07:10.531">I THINK YOU&apos;RE GOING TO SEE THIS...</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.531" end="00:07:11.231">&gt;&gt; Jon: A GRASSROOTS BATTLE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.231" end="00:07:13.166">&gt;&gt; A GRASSROOTS BATTLEMENT THEY NEED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.166" end="00:07:14.301">THEY NEED IT ON THE LEFT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.301" end="00:07:19.907">THEY NEED TO HAVE THAT ANCHOR PHILOSOPHICALLY OF WHAT DO WE REALLY PHILOSOPHICALLY BELIEVE IN.</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.907" end="00:07:25.946">AND A LOT OF THAT STARTS WITH THOSE EXTREME POSITIONS THAT HELP YOU MOVE TO THAT SPOT WHERE </p>
