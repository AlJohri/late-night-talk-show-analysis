<p begin="00:00:06.406" end="00:00:07.708">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.708" end="00:00:09.910">MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A REPORTER FOR THE &quot;NEW YORK TIMES&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.910" end="00:00:14.848">HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED &quot;THE OBAMAS.&quot; PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JODI KANTOR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.848" end="00:00:23.090">(  <span tts:fontStyle="italic">CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</span> HOW ARE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.090" end="00:00:24.057">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.057" end="00:00:24.758">&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.758" end="00:00:29.563">THE BOOK IS CALLED &quot;THE OBAMAS.&quot; I&apos;M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.563" end="00:00:32.933">I HEARD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT THIS BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.933" end="00:00:38.071">THE PORTRAYING THE FIRST LADY VERY POORLY, AS AN ANGRY WOMAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.071" end="00:00:40.674">SHE WAS OUT ON GAYLE KING SHOW TALKING ABOUT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.674" end="00:00:44.077">I SAW YOU ON CNN WHERE THE WOMAN WAS YELLING AT YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.077" end="00:00:50.083">SO I MADE THE MISTAKE OF LISTENING TO THAT BEFORE READING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.083" end="00:00:52.719">SO I WAS VERY ANGRY AT YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.719" end="00:00:53.720">&gt;&gt; AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.720" end="00:00:55.255">&gt;&gt; Jon: I READ IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.255" end="00:00:56.056">&gt;&gt; AND?</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.056" end="00:00:58.625">&gt;&gt; Jon: SHE SEEMS NICE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.625" end="00:01:00.060">&gt;&gt; (LAUGHING).</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.060" end="00:01:00.861">&gt;&gt; Jon: REALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.861" end="00:01:05.098">I&apos;M SURPRISED AT THE CONTROVERSY BECAUSE THE BOOK SEEMS TO PORTRAY MICHELLE </p>
<p begin="00:01:05.098" end="00:01:11.171">OBAMA AS A COMPLEX YET HUMAN INDIVIDUAL STRUGGLING WITH THIS UNBELIEVABLE SITUATION </p>
<p begin="00:01:11.171" end="00:01:18.979">YET REMAINING THE MORAL COMPASS AND CENTER OF AN ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO FIND ITS FOOTING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.979" end="00:01:22.282">THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY TO YOU IS, HOW DARE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.282" end="00:01:24.084">&gt;&gt; IT IS REALLY WEIRD TO ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.084" end="00:01:28.722">I&apos;VE BEEN COVERING THE OBAMAS FOR FIVE YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.722" end="00:01:32.526">BASICALLY I ASKED TWO QUESTIONS: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE THESE TWO PRETTY </p>
<p begin="00:01:32.526" end="00:01:38.131">REGULAR PEOPLE AND PUT THEM IN THE EXTREMELY ABNORMAL SITUATION AT THE WHITE HOUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.131" end="00:01:42.236">THE REPORTING IS FILLED WITH DETAILS OF HOW LIFE THERE IS REALLY KIND OF WEIRD AND HARD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.236" end="00:01:47.341">AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THERE ADJUSTMENT LIKE TO BEING PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.341" end="00:01:48.675">THEIR RISE WAS SO FAST.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.675" end="00:01:50.911">SO THE WHITE HOUSE REALLY COOPERATED WITH THE BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.911" end="00:01:54.448">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO TALKS TO YOU ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP?</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.448" end="00:01:59.419">&gt;&gt; WELL, 33 CURRENT AND FORMER WHITE HOUSE AIDES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.419" end="00:02:01.655">A LOT OF THEIR BEST FRIENDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.655" end="00:02:03.957">ALSO I&apos;VE INTERVIEWED THE OBAMAS A BUNCH OF TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.957" end="00:02:04.791">&gt;&gt; Jon: NAMES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.791" end="00:02:05.692">TELL ME THEIR NAMES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.692" end="00:02:08.428">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE IN THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.428" end="00:02:13.166">SUCH FIGURES AT VALERIE GARRETT AND ROBERT GIBBS AND DAVID AXELROD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.166" end="00:02:14.735">ALSO I FACT-CHECKED THE BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.735" end="00:02:16.837">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.837" end="00:02:18.939">WHAT KIND OF WRITER ARE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.939" end="00:02:23.610">&gt;&gt; WELL, AND SO THE WHITE HOUSE PRETTY MUCH KNEW WHAT WAS IN IT BEFORE IT CAME OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.610" end="00:02:27.214">SO ANYWAY, I HAVE BEEN REALLY SURPRISED BECAUSE....</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.214" end="00:02:29.082">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO IS MAD AT YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.082" end="00:02:34.221">BECAUSE THE LADY ON CNN WAS ANGRY THAT YOU HAD NOT SPOKEN TO THE COUPLE SINCE 2009.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.221" end="00:02:38.492">&gt;&gt; WELL BY HER LOGIC, WE WOULDN&apos;T WRITE OBITUARIES BECAUSE WE CAN&apos;T TALK TO THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:38.492" end="00:02:41.528">DEAD PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.528" end="00:02:42.596">SO I DON&apos;T KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.596" end="00:02:43.497">BUT THE THING....</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.497" end="00:02:49.403">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.403" end="00:02:50.771">SORRY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.771" end="00:02:54.208">THAT WAS AN ODD PLACE TO TAKE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.208" end="00:02:55.342">GO AHEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.342" end="00:02:57.110">WHO IS PUSHING BACK?</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.110" end="00:02:59.713">IS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION UPSET WITH YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.713" end="00:03:07.221">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I THINK ONE THING THAT IS A LITTLE BIT DELICATE IS THAT THERE IS SOME BEHIND-THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.221" end="00:03:08.789">-SCENES IN THE BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.789" end="00:03:11.658">THAT SHOWS US A LITTLE BIT HOW THE SAUSAGE IS MADE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.658" end="00:03:15.128">FOR EXAMPLE, THE OBAMA... YOU KNOW,.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.128" end="00:03:17.731">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A SAUSAGE FACTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.731" end="00:03:19.933">SHE&apos;S NOT BEING METAPHORICAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.933" end="00:03:25.105">FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND TO RAISE A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY THEY HAVE A SAUSAGE FACTORY,</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.105" end="00:03:28.075">THEY HAVE AN ORGANIC FARM TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.075" end="00:03:32.646">&gt;&gt; WE SEE A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL IMAGES OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY TOGETHER, VERY </p>
<p begin="00:03:32.646" end="00:03:33.647">POLISHED AND PERFECT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.647" end="00:03:39.720">THERE&apos;S AN OVAL OFFICE MEETING IN THE FALL OF 2010 WHERE THE OBAMAS ARE SPECIFICALLY TOLD </p>
<p begin="00:03:39.720" end="00:03:41.855">DEMOCRATS LOVE SEEING YOU TOGETHER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.855" end="00:03:45.492">AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING LESS POPULAR AT THIS POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.492" end="00:03:49.997">THE FIRST LADY IS TOLD SPECIFICALLY HOW BADLY SHE&apos;S NEEDED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.997" end="00:03:52.232">YOU&apos;RE GOING TO SEE THAT IN 2012.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.232" end="00:03:55.369">I DON&apos;T KNOW IF YOU HAVE OBAMA SUPPORTERS WATCHING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.369" end="00:04:02.042">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHING) (  <span tts:fontStyle="italic">CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</span> </p>
<p begin="00:04:02.042" end="00:04:06.813">&gt;&gt; SO YOU KNOW THAT LIKE YOU KNOW THE 9,000 EMAILS YOU GET FROM THEM SAYING COME TO </p>
<p begin="00:04:06.813" end="00:04:09.283">DINNER WITH ME AND BARACK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.283" end="00:04:14.421">THE BOOK IN PART IS SHOWING YOU HOW SHE BECOMES THIS POLITICALLY VERY POWERFUL FIGURE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.421" end="00:04:17.724">SHE DOES HAVE AN INITIAL HARD TIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.724" end="00:04:18.325">WHY?</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.325" end="00:04:22.629">BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE IS A REALLY WEIRD, HARD PLACE TO LIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.629" end="00:04:25.799">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT IN TERMS OF CONTROVERSY IT&apos;S NOT, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.799" end="00:04:30.437">APPARENTLY THERE&apos;S A LITTLE FRICTION BETWEEN HER AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.437" end="00:04:32.139">I MEAN, I WORK IN COMEDY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.139" end="00:04:35.809">MY WIFE HATES EVERYONE I WORK WITH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.809" end="00:04:38.078">AS WELL SHE SHOULD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.078" end="00:04:43.784">BUT LIKE THE CONTROVERSY IS SO... IT FEELS LIKE WHAT&apos;S CONTROVERSIAL ABOUT THIS BOOK </p>
<p begin="00:04:43.784" end="00:04:48.288">IS WHERE WE&apos;VE COME IN THIS COUNTRY POLITICALLY FOR A POLITICIAN HOW UNTENABLE IT IS </p>
<p begin="00:04:48.288" end="00:04:51.458">TO BE A POLITICIAN ANYMORE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.458" end="00:04:56.096">I MEAN THERE WERE SLAVES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.096" end="00:04:59.399">MRS. ROOSEVELT WAS SLEEPING WITH SOME OTHER LADY WHILE FRANKLIN COULD WALK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.399" end="00:05:01.335">THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF STUFF GOING ON.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.335" end="00:05:03.871">&gt;&gt; NOT ONLY THAT BUT, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.871" end="00:05:09.042">THERE ARE SOME STORIES ABOUT HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO HAVE A FAMILY AND TWO YOUNG KIDS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.042" end="00:05:09.877">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT MUST BE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.877" end="00:05:15.816">&gt;&gt; THE FIRST TIME THAT MALIA AND SASHA TRIED TO DO TRICK OR TREATING ON HALLOWEEN IN </p>
<p begin="00:05:15.816" end="00:05:19.119">WASHINGTON THEY JUST WANTED TO GO TO A NORMAL NEIGHBORHOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.119" end="00:05:22.422">THEIR PARENTS CAN&apos;T DO THAT STUFF WITH THEM SO FRIENDS AND FAMILY CAME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.422" end="00:05:24.091">THEY WERE SWARMED A LITTLE BIT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.091" end="00:05:25.325">NEIGHBORS WERE TEXTING NEIGHBORS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.325" end="00:05:28.962">THEY KIND OF HAD TO GO BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN DEFEAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.962" end="00:05:31.498">ACTUALLY WHETHER IT&apos;S REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.498" end="00:05:36.803">AFTER REPORTING THIS BOOK, YOU KNOW, I SORT OF FEEL LIKE &quot;FREE THE FIRST FAMILY.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:36.803" end="00:05:39.706">THE WAY WE&apos;RE ASKING THESE PEOPLE TO LIVE IS VERY HARD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.706" end="00:05:41.241">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE COULD ACTUALLY DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.241" end="00:05:44.778">WE COULD CHANGE THE ENTIRE WAY THAT OUR CULTURE OPERATES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.778" end="00:05:46.647">&gt;&gt; (LAUGHING).</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.647" end="00:05:49.283">&gt;&gt; Jon: OR WE COULD JUST DRIVE THEM UNDERGROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.283" end="00:05:52.419">I THINK I KNOW WHICH DIRECTION THIS IS GOING IN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.419" end="00:05:57.791">DO YOU THINK AT THIS POINT ANY PRESIDENT WILL EVER ALLOW ACCESS AGAIN, GIVEN HOW ALL </p>
<p begin="00:05:57.791" end="00:06:03.197">THESE BOOKS ALWAYS COME OUT WITH SOMETHING WHERE THE WHITE HOUSE IS LIKE-- REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.197" end="00:06:07.634">DO YOU THINK THE FINAL VERSION OF ALL THIS WILL BE PRESIDENTS NO LONGER ALLOW COOPERATION </p>
<p begin="00:06:07.634" end="00:06:08.468">FROM REPORTERS?</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.468" end="00:06:13.340">&gt;&gt; WELL EXCEPT THAT YOU READ THE BOOK AND YOU ENDED UP THINKING THAT MICHELLE OBAMA </p>
<p begin="00:06:13.340" end="00:06:17.811">WAS A STRONG PERSON WITH A FIRM MORAL COMPASS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.811" end="00:06:24.685">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT I ONLY READ IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE WAS CRAZY (BEEP) IN THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.685" end="00:06:25.786">&gt;&gt; (LAUGHING).</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.786" end="00:06:28.922">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU REALLY DISAPPOINTED ME.</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.922" end="00:06:31.325">MY WHOLE WEEKEND.</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.325" end="00:06:33.360">EXCEPT FOR THE GIANTS WHICH WAS AWESOME.</p>
