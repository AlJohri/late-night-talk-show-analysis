<p begin="00:00:06.073" end="00:00:09.576">&gt;&gt; MY GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.576" end="00:00:15.816">NEW PUBLISHED BOOK BY AMAZON.COM IS CALLED KATRINA&apos;S SECRETS, STORM AFTER THE STORM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.816" end="00:00:19.553">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM RAY NAGIN, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.553" end="00:00:21.255">(APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:00:21.255" end="00:00:25.659">&gt;&gt; VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.659" end="00:00:26.693">&gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.693" end="00:00:28.762">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I&apos;M GOOD, JON,</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.762" end="00:00:29.463">HOW BUT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.463" end="00:00:31.164">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M DOING VERY WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.164" end="00:00:32.866">&gt;&gt; EXPLAIN THIS TO ME THIS IS SELF-PUBLISHED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.866" end="00:00:35.235">&gt;&gt; YEAH, SELF-PUBLISHED THROUGH CREATE SPACE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.235" end="00:00:40.841">HI SPOKEN WITH A COUPLE OF AGENTS AND JUST DIDN&apos;T GET COMFORTABLE THAT MY VOICE </p>
<p begin="00:00:40.841" end="00:00:41.975">WOULD COME THROUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.975" end="00:00:47.147">BECAUSE ONCE YOU TURN OVER YOUR MAN YOU SCRIPT TO A PUBLISHER YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.147" end="00:00:48.482">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY WILL JUST TWIST IT AROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.482" end="00:00:52.186">&gt;&gt; THEY WANT IMMEDIATE TO TONE IT DOWN, TONE IT UP.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.186" end="00:00:55.989">&gt;&gt; Jon: THERE WERE THINGS IN THERE THAT I WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED AT WHEN I READ,</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.989" end="00:00:58.392">THE GOVERNOR OF YOUR STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.392" end="00:00:59.426">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.426" end="00:01:03.163">&gt;&gt; Jon: KATHLEEN BLANCO AT THE TIME DOES NOT COME OUT WELL IN THIS BOOK REASONS REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.163" end="00:01:05.199">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:05.199" end="00:01:06.567">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE SEEN THE BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.567" end="00:01:08.602">&gt;&gt; I&apos;VE SEEN THE BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.602" end="00:01:10.304">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S SELF-PUBLISHED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.304" end="00:01:10.704">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.704" end="00:01:11.839">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU WROTE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.839" end="00:01:13.707">&gt;&gt; YEAH, I WROTE IT, EVERY WORD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.707" end="00:01:15.475">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU THOUGHT SHE CAME OUT OKAY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.475" end="00:01:19.446">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S A SCENE IN THE BOOK WHERE YOU DESCRIBE HER AS BECAUSE YOU SUPPORTED HER </p>
<p begin="00:01:19.446" end="00:01:23.183">OPPONENT BOBBY JINDAL IN THE GOVERNOR&apos;S RACE THAT SHE SAYS IT TO YOU THIS IS LIKE </p>
<p begin="00:01:23.183" end="00:01:26.620">A WEEK BEFORE KATRINA, YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.620" end="00:01:29.089">VENGENCE WILL BE MINE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.089" end="00:01:30.090">I MEAN -- </p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:35.863">&gt;&gt; IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE HER RESPONSE TO NEW ORLEANS AND KATRINA WAS A PERSONAL </p>
<p begin="00:01:35.863" end="00:01:37.331">VENDETTA AGAINST YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.331" end="00:01:40.100">&gt;&gt; SHE TOLD ME THERE WOULD BE HELL TO PAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.100" end="00:01:43.103">AND I THINK KATRINA QUALIFIES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.103" end="00:01:48.609">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU THINK SHE CONJURED UP THE STORM?</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.609" end="00:01:51.678">&gt;&gt; NO, I&apos;M NOT SAYING SHE QON JUERED UP THE STORM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.678" end="00:01:54.114">BUT I THINK THERE WERE SOME RESIDUALS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.114" end="00:01:58.352">&gt;&gt; Jon: I MEAN IS SHE-- IS SHE THAT PETTY AN INDIVIDUAL THAT SHE WOULD SAY OH,</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.352" end="00:02:04.324">PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING AT THE SUPERDOME, RAY NAGIN DOESN&apos;T GET WATER FROM ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.324" end="00:02:09.363">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK SO BUT I THINK THERE WAS SOME POLITICS PLAYED A ROLE IN </p>
<p begin="00:02:09.363" end="00:02:10.097">THIS, THE RESPONSE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.097" end="00:02:17.538">WE HAD A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, A DEMOCRATIC-- GEM CAT GOVERNMENT NEVER AND I WAS A DEMOCRAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.538" end="00:02:22.609">THE GOVERNOR AND I DIDN&apos;T GET DATA LONG VERY WELL BEFORE THE STORM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.609" end="00:02:26.680">&gt;&gt; Jon: LOUISIANA IS A RELATIVELY AND I SAY THIS WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.680" end="00:02:27.381">DYSFUNCTIONAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.381" end="00:02:34.888">IT IS A DYSFUNCTIONAL AND SOMEWHAT, THE WORDS-- CORRUPT HAVE OFTEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.888" end="00:02:37.658">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S HAD A COLOURFUL HISTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.658" end="00:02:41.395">&gt;&gt; Jon: WOULDN&apos;T YOU SAY THAT PARTISANSHIP PLAYED LESS IN THIS THAN MAYBE THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:41.395" end="00:02:42.796">POLITICAL CULTURE IN LOUISIANA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.796" end="00:02:45.132">&gt;&gt; THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THINGS GOING ON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.132" end="00:02:46.834">PARTISAN POLITICS, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.834" end="00:02:52.139">THE GOVERNOR AND I, AND THEN THIS THING CALLED-- WHICH IS A LAW THAT WAS IN EFFECT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.139" end="00:02:56.443">SO THE GOVERNOR AND PRESIDENT WERE BASICALLY DANCING AND DECIDES WHO WOULD CONTROL THE RESOURCES,</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.443" end="00:02:59.179">WHO WOULD CONTROL THE RECOVERY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.179" end="00:03:01.915">AND THAT SLOWED DOWN THE RECOVERY MORE THAN ANYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.915" end="00:03:05.586">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE POINT IS THAT 24 HOUR PERIOD WHEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE PRESIDENT </p>
<p begin="00:03:05.586" end="00:03:06.587">MET AND HE WOULD NOT -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:06.587" end="00:03:08.355">&gt;&gt; ON AIR FORCE ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.355" end="00:03:10.657">&gt;&gt; HE WOULD NOT SUPERSEDE HER AUTHORITY AND SHE -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:10.657" end="00:03:15.162">&gt;&gt; HE SAID HE WOULDN&apos;T BUT LATER SHE DID NOT GIVE HIM THE AUTHORITY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.162" end="00:03:17.865">BUT HE TOOK IT ANYWAY A FEW DAYS LATER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.865" end="00:03:19.967">SO HE HAD THE AUTHORITY ALL ALONG.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.967" end="00:03:22.302">&gt;&gt; Jon: AT A CERTAIN POINT HE SAID ENOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.302" end="00:03:26.139">&gt;&gt; BUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BLAME FEMA AND THE PRESIDENT&apos;S RESPONSE, FOR </p>
<p begin="00:03:26.139" end="00:03:31.478">HIM TO IN ESSENCE SAY TO A GOVERNOR YOU SAY YOU GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.478" end="00:03:33.614">I&apos;LL GIVE YOU SOME BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.614" end="00:03:34.281">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.281" end="00:03:35.983">&gt;&gt; BUT HERE&apos;S WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.983" end="00:03:37.417">WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT RESOURCES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.417" end="00:03:38.785">AND THIS BLUE MY MIND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.785" end="00:03:43.891">WHEN YOU DID THE MANDATORY EVACUATION AND THIS WAS ON THE SATURDAY NIGHT, SUNDAY </p>
<p begin="00:03:43.891" end="00:03:47.361">MORNING, SATURDAY NIGHT YOU GOT THE BAD WEATHER REPORT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.361" end="00:03:51.098">SUNDAY MORNING YOU SAID I&apos;M GOING TO MAKE THIS A MANDATORY EVACUATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.098" end="00:03:55.536">&gt;&gt; IN THE EVACUATION NOTICE IT SAYS COME TO THE SUPERDOME IF YOU CAN&apos;T GET OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.536" end="00:03:56.570">BRING SUPPLIES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.570" end="00:03:58.605">FOOD AND WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.605" end="00:04:00.307">&gt;&gt; FOR TWO TO THREE DAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.307" end="00:04:05.412">&gt;&gt; I HAD NEVER HEARD THAT IN A DISASTER AND THAT MIGHT BE MY IGNORANCE BUT ESPECIALLY </p>
<p begin="00:04:05.412" end="00:04:10.384">FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO POOR TO GET OUT, THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD BE LIKE LET&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:04:10.384" end="00:04:15.689">PACK OUR COOL WE ARE TURKEY AND SANDWICHES AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.689" end="00:04:20.494">WHY DIDN&apos;T THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS HAVE THE SUPERDOME STOCKED WITH WATER, RATHER </p>
<p begin="00:04:20.494" end="00:04:27.968">THAN RELYING ON PEOPLE TOO POOR TO GET AWAY TO, LET&apos;S SAY, BRING THEIR OWN BOTTLED WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.968" end="00:04:28.602">&gt;&gt; WELL, WE DID.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.602" end="00:04:32.773">WE HAD SOME SUPPLIES IN THE SUPERDOME BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.773" end="00:04:35.909">WHOEVER SHOWED UP THAT THEY WOULD AT LEAST HAVE SOMETHING TO SUPPLEMENT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.909" end="00:04:37.211">BECAUSE WE REALLY DIDN&apos;T KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.211" end="00:04:44.351">WE PLANNED FOR 2 OR 3 DAYS BUT IT ENDED UP BEING 6 TO 7 DAYS BEFORE HELP REALLY CAME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.351" end="00:04:47.988">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT SO IN RETROSPECT WOULD YOU SAY THOUGH THAT ALSO WAS, THAT </p>
<p begin="00:04:47.988" end="00:04:54.361">NEW ORLEANS ITSELF HAD NOT SERIOUSLY ENOUGH CONSIDERED THAT THE REAL RAMIFICATION </p>
<p begin="00:04:54.361" end="00:04:57.798">OF THIS TYPE OF TERRIBLE STORM OR DOW REALLY FEEL LIKE IT WAS -- </p>
<p begin="00:04:57.798" end="00:05:02.135">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK ANYONE ANTICIPATED THAT HURRICANE KATRINA WOULD DO WHAT IT DID.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.135" end="00:05:04.805">IF IT WASN&apos;T FOR THE FAILURE OF THE LEVEES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.805" end="00:05:07.541">KEEP IN MIND, THE FIRST REPORTS THAT CAME OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.541" end="00:05:10.043">&gt;&gt; Jon: THERE WERE PEOPLE SAYING THE LEVIES COULD -- </p>
<p begin="00:05:10.043" end="00:05:13.380">&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING IT FOR 30, 40 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.380" end="00:05:14.414">BUT THEY NEVER DID.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.414" end="00:05:16.116">SO THEY FINALLY-- .</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.116" end="00:05:19.920">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THAT&apos;S LIKE SAYING THEY SAY THESE TORNADOES CAN TEAR UP ENTIRE </p>
<p begin="00:05:19.920" end="00:05:21.054">TOWNS BUT SINCE THEY DON&apos;T,</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.054" end="00:05:24.291">WE DECIDED NOT TO BUILD BASEMENTS AND THEN, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.291" end="00:05:28.362">DON&apos;T YOU THINK IN SOME RESPECTS THERE IS A RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LOCAL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.362" end="00:05:31.431">&gt;&gt; DON&apos;T GET ME WRONG, LOOK THERE WERE MISTAKES MADE ON MY PART.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.431" end="00:05:33.467">COY HAVE DONE A LOT OF THINGS BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.467" end="00:05:39.239">BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE SCENE THAT HAPPEN, WE GOT OUT ABOUT 96% OF THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:39.239" end="00:05:41.275">WILL THE PEOPLE, GOT THEM OUT OF HARM AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.275" end="00:05:46.480">I DON&apos;T THINK ANY OTHER CITY HAS BEEN ABLE TO EVACUATE, I THINK IN NEW YORK TRIED TOW </p>
<p begin="00:05:46.480" end="00:05:47.147">VAC YATE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.147" end="00:05:48.482">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE DID, ONCE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.482" end="00:05:49.183">&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.183" end="00:05:52.819">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE STAND BY THE WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.819" end="00:05:53.187">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.187" end="00:05:56.323">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THEN ONE GUY GOES LET&apos;S [BLEEP] SWIM.</p>
