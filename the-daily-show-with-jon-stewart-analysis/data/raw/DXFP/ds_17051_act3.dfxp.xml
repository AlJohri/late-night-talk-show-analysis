<p begin="00:02:51.738" end="00:02:53.173">YOU DRAW THE LINE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.173" end="00:02:54.608">&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.608" end="00:02:58.145">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT IS IT ABOUT DIRECTING THAT IS SOP MUCH MORE STRENUOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.145" end="00:02:59.847">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I&apos;VE GOT KIDS,</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.847" end="00:03:03.917">I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW PEOPLE DIRECT MOVIES WITHOUT KIDS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.917" end="00:03:07.754">&gt;&gt; Jon: HERE IS WHAT I DO, I WORK VERY HARD, YOU JUST DON&apos;T SEE THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.754" end="00:03:08.388">&gt;&gt; OKAY.</p>

<p begin="00:03:35.382" end="00:03:40.821">&gt;&gt; Jon: I FEEL LIKE 14 IS THE ABLE WHERE EVERYONE SAYS THEY TURN ON YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.821" end="00:03:41.522">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S NONSENSE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.522" end="00:03:42.823">I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT THAT IS ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.823" end="00:03:47.361">THAT IS JUST ANOTHER WAY OF SELLING DRUGS TO PARENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.361" end="00:03:48.395">&gt;&gt; Jon: WAIT, WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.395" end="00:03:52.900">&gt;&gt; YES OR TO THE KIDS EITHER.</p>

<p begin="00:03:56.103" end="00:03:59.873">&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A HANDY HABIT BY THE TIME ARE YOU 14.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.873" end="00:04:04.778">&gt;&gt; Jon: I CAN&apos;T IMAGINE AN AGE, 7 AND 6 THEY TILL HAVE THAT INCREDIBLY INNOCENT ENTHUSIASM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.778" end="00:04:05.546">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
