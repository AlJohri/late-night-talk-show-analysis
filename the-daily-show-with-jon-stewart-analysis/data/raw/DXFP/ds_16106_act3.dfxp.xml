<p begin="00:00:28.829" end="00:00:33.267">CROCKETT BOOK, RARELY I DO GET A GUEST WHO IS AN AUTHOR,</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.267" end="00:00:38.372">BE OF GREAT RENOWN PROMOTING A BOOK AND CAN ALSO PROMOTE AN ANIMATED FILM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.372" end="00:00:39.706">YOU WERE IN CARS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.706" end="00:00:41.542">&gt;&gt; I WAS, INDEED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.542" end="00:00:49.950">I WAS-- I WAS THE HIGH SHERIFF OF RADIATOR SPRINGS LOOKING FOR--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:00:49.950" end="00:00:51.218">&gt;&gt; Jon: UNBELIEVABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.218" end="00:00:56.056">&gt;&gt; AND I CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF TRACTOR TIPPERS OUT THERE IN THAT AUDIENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.056" end="00:00:57.624">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:00:57.624" end="00:00:59.526">&gt;&gt; Jon: AWESOME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.526" end="00:01:02.796">DAVID CROCKETT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.796" end="00:01:04.231">DAVID.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.231" end="00:01:07.334">&gt;&gt; HE NEVER USED THE NAME DAVEY FOR HIMSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.334" end="00:01:08.669">NEVER SIGNED IT DAVEY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.669" end="00:01:11.071">SO IT WAS DAVID CROCKETT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.071" end="00:01:14.441">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THAT, AND HE WAS NOT SHY ABOUT PROMOTING HIMSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.441" end="00:01:22.316">SO HOW DID IT TURN INTO, IS THAT JUST A CREATION OF AMERICAN-- IT SOUNDED BETTER IN THE SONGS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.316" end="00:01:27.754">&gt;&gt; YEAH, AND THEN THE ALMANACS, AND WITH THE FOLKS IN GENERAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.754" end="00:01:31.158">I MEAN THE PEOPLE WOULD CALL HIM DAVEY CROCKETT, YOU KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.158" end="00:01:33.894">THAT WAS JUST HIS WAY OF IDENTIFYING HIMSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.894" end="00:01:36.263">&gt;&gt; NOW WHAT I KNOW OF DAVID CROCKETT IS THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.263" end="00:01:38.565">I KNOW HE WAS BORN IN TENNESSEE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.565" end="00:01:43.136">KILLED A BASH WHEN HE WAS THREE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.136" end="00:01:45.172">AND THEN I LOSE THE TRAIL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.172" end="00:01:49.276">&gt;&gt; HE WAS ACTUALLY BORN IN THE STATE OF FRANKLIN BEFORE TENNESSEE BECAME A STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.276" end="00:01:54.882">AND HE HAD NEVER KILLED A BEAR WHEN HE WAS ONLY THREE BUT HE WAS A PROFESSIONAL BEAR HUNTER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.882" end="00:01:59.353">ONE SEASON HE SLEW 105 BLACK BEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.353" end="00:02:05.058">&gt;&gt; SO HE WAS AS MUCH OF A LEGEND AS HE WAS, AS MUCH HYPERBOWL AS WAS THERE, HE </p>
<p begin="00:02:05.058" end="00:02:06.059">ACTUALLY WAS THE REAL DEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.059" end="00:02:07.094">&gt;&gt; HE WAS THE REAL DEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.094" end="00:02:09.830">THE TRUTH IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN FICTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.830" end="00:02:12.499">AND LIKE SO MANY OF BOOMERS,</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.499" end="00:02:16.303">I GREW UP WITH THE-- PARKER IMAGE OF CROCKETT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.303" end="00:02:19.206">AND IT WAS ENTERTAINING AND CHARMING WHEN YOU ARE NINE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.206" end="00:02:22.743">BUT IT WASN&apos;T THE REAL THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.743" end="00:02:25.846">CROCKETT LIKE SO MANY FIGURES FROM THE WEST,</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.846" end="00:02:27.347">OTHERS I HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT,</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.347" end="00:02:31.752">PRETTY BOY FLIED, BILLY THE KID, JESSY JAMES, THERE&apos;S THE REAL MAN AND THEN </p>
<p begin="00:02:31.752" end="00:02:33.754">THERE&apos;S THE MYTH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.754" end="00:02:38.158">SO THE TWO OFTEN COLLIDE AND GET TOGETHER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.158" end="00:02:41.962">AND IT HAPPENED DEFINITELY IN CROCKETT&apos;S OWN LIFETIME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.962" end="00:02:45.799">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S WHAT WAS SO SURPRISING IS THAT I DIDN&apos;T REALIZE THAT CROCKETT IN HIS </p>
<p begin="00:02:45.799" end="00:02:56.677">LIFETIME WAS SUCH A RENOWNED FIGURE AND THAT HE ACTUALLY ATTENDED A PLAY THAT WAS ABOUT HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.677" end="00:02:58.712">AND I GUESS IT WAS IN 1831.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.712" end="00:02:59.746">AND HE -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:59.746" end="00:03:01.114">&gt;&gt; IN WASHINGTON, D.C..</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.114" end="00:03:02.049">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.049" end="00:03:07.054">AND HE OF COURSE SERVED SUCCESSFULLY IN CONGRESS FOR SEVERAL TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.054" end="00:03:13.794">AND HE WENT TO SEE THIS PLAY CALLED, AND THAT&apos;S WHAT I USE FOR MY SUBTITLE, THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:13.794" end="00:03:14.795">LION OF THE WEST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.795" end="00:03:19.967">AND HE KNEW IT WAS LOOSELY BASED ON HIM SOW WENT INTO THE THEATRE WITH HIS ENTOURAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.967" end="00:03:21.668">THEY SEATED HIM IN THE FIRST ROW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.668" end="00:03:25.072">EVERYONE WAS WONDERING WHAT&apos;S CROCKETT GOING TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.072" end="00:03:30.577">WILL HE GET UP AND PUMMEL THE ACTOR PLAYING HIM OR YOU KNOW, WHAT WILL DO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.577" end="00:03:36.650">WELL, THE FACTOR JAMES -- ACTOR JAMES HACKETT CAME LEAPING OUT ON THE STAGE IN </p>
<p begin="00:03:36.650" end="00:03:44.691">AN ALMOST BURR LESSING OVER THE TOP FRINGED OUTFIT NOT WITH A RACOON CAP ON BUT WITH A BOBCAT HAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.691" end="00:03:48.962">AND HE WAS CALLED NIMROD WILDFIRE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.962" end="00:03:53.534">(LAUGHTER) SO I WOULD HAVE PUMMELED HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.534" end="00:03:54.735">&gt;&gt; Jon: I THINK MAYBE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.735" end="00:03:59.139">BUT CROCKETT DIDN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.139" end="00:04:02.042">&gt;&gt; NIMROD MADE A BIG SWEEPING BOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.042" end="00:04:03.911">THERE WAS A HUSHED SILENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.911" end="00:04:08.749">CROCKETT STOOD AND MAKE A BIG SWEEPING BOUGH BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.749" end="00:04:11.084">REALITY-- AND MYTH MET RIGHT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.084" end="00:04:12.486">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S AN AMAZING STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.486" end="00:04:15.889">I WONDER IF HE WENT BACK AFTERWARDS AND SAID LET&apos;S TALK ABOUT THE NAME NIMROD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.889" end="00:04:17.591">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:04:17.591" end="00:04:19.560">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET&apos;S SEE IF WE CAN CHANGE THAT AROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.560" end="00:04:25.766">NOW OBVIOUSLY FOR ME THE MYTHOLOGY OF DAVEY CROCKETT CEMENTS ITSELF AT THE ALAMO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.766" end="00:04:29.636">BUT EVEN THAT STORY, YOU KNOW, HE IS SAID TO HAVE INVENTED TEXAS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.636" end="00:04:33.674">DID HE GO THERE, THE IDEA IS HE WENT DOWN THERE TO FIGHT FOR LIBERTY IN TEXAS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.674" end="00:04:36.410">&gt;&gt; HE WENT DOWN THERE TO REBUILD HIS CAREER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.410" end="00:04:43.283">HE HAD BEEN VOTED OUT OF CONGRESS LARGELY BECAUSE HE STOOD UP AGAINST HIS PRESIDENT AND FORMER </p>
<p begin="00:04:43.283" end="00:04:47.688">POLITICAL MENTOR ANDREW JACKSON OVER THE ISSUE OF INDIAN REMOVAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.688" end="00:04:51.792">THE TRAILS OF TEARS THAT LEAD TO WHERE I NOW LIVE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.792" end="00:04:54.328">OKLAHOMA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.328" end="00:04:55.529">AKA INDIAN TERRITORY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.529" end="00:04:59.600">CROCKETT HAD SEEN THE HORRENDOUS ATROCITIES OF THE CREEK WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:03.737">HE WANTED NO MORE OF THAT HE SAID TO JACKSON YOU&apos;VE MESSED WITH THESE PEOPLE ENOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.737" end="00:05:04.371">LET THEM BE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.371" end="00:05:08.842">AND HE WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE TENNESSEE DELEGATION TO VOTE AGAINST THE BILL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.842" end="00:05:12.546">HE STOOD UP TO HIS PARTY, TO HIS CONSTITUENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.546" end="00:05:14.781">WE NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE THAT IN CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.781" end="00:05:16.049">&gt;&gt; I THINK SO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.049" end="00:05:19.820">&gt;&gt; I WOULD THINK SO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.820" end="00:05:21.855">&gt;&gt; SO HE WENT DOWN TO TEXAS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.855" end="00:05:24.224">&gt;&gt; AND HE WENT DOWN TO TEXAS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.224" end="00:05:27.227">&gt;&gt; SO JACKSON FOUND THE CANDIDATE TO RUN AGAINST HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.227" end="00:05:29.930">AS CROCKETT LIKED TO POINT OUT, A ONE LEGGED MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.930" end="00:05:31.064">THEY VOTED HIM OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.064" end="00:05:35.402">AND THAT&apos;S WHEN HE FAMOUSLY SAID MANY TIMES AD NAUSEAM,</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.402" end="00:05:37.104">YOU ALL CAN GO TO HELL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.104" end="00:05:38.639">I&apos;M GOING TO TEXAS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:42.543">&gt;&gt; AND HE WENT DOWN THERE BECAUSE HE WAS GYPSY FOOTED AND HE WANTED TO LOOK AT NEW </p>
<p begin="00:05:42.543" end="00:05:46.079">TERRITORY AND REBUILD HIS CAREER AND HE WANTED TO HUNT EVERY DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.079" end="00:05:47.714">HE TOOK WEEKS TO GET DOWN THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.714" end="00:05:50.784">HE WAS CHASING�i BISON,</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.784" end="00:05:52.152">LOOKING FOR HONEY TREES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.152" end="00:05:55.956">THEY THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD HE FINALLY GOT DOWN THERE AND SAID I WOULD REALLY LIKE </p>
<p begin="00:05:55.956" end="00:06:00.727">THIS LAND AND HE SAID YOU CAN HAVE IT BUT YOU NEED TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MILITIA.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.727" end="00:06:03.497">THESE TEXTANS WERE REVOLTING AGAINST THEIR OWN COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.497" end="00:06:05.499">THEY WERE IN MEXICO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.499" end="00:06:14.041">THEY WERE IMMIGRANTS THAT CAME INTO OLD MEXICO, INTO THE STATE OF TEJAS BUT THEY STILL KEPT COMING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.041" end="00:06:17.377">HENCE THEY WERE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.377" end="00:06:19.913">&gt;&gt; OH MY GOSH.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.913" end="00:06:23.917">IF ONLY SANTA ANNA HAD BEEN ABLE TO BUILD THAT DANG FENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.917" end="00:06:26.653">&gt;&gt; WELL, SLAVERY WAS ABOLISHED IN MEXICO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.653" end="00:06:30.057">SO THAT&apos;S-- AND THEY WERE LARGELY SLAVES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.057" end="00:06:32.492">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE WERE HOPING IN SOME WAYS TO PRESERVE SLAVERY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.492" end="00:06:35.929">&gt;&gt; WE WANTED A PLANTATION SYSTEM IN TEXAS, OF COURSE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.929" end="00:06:39.566">SO CROCKETT, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.566" end="00:06:42.069">UNBENOENS TO HIM, SIGNED UP FOR THE MILITIA.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.069" end="00:06:46.773">THEY SENT HIM TO THE BAT ERRED MISSION IN SAN ANTONIO AND AT 49 YEARS OF AGE THE </p>
<p begin="00:06:46.773" end="00:06:49.743">CURTAIN FELL ON CROCKETT AND NIMROD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.743" end="00:06:54.081">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S A A MAGNIFICENT STORY AND HIS THREE IS SO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY </p>
<p begin="00:06:54.081" end="00:06:55.082">FICTION COULD BE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.082" end="00:06:55.516">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S THE BEST.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.516" end="00:06:56.383">&gt;&gt; Jon: I LOVE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.383" end="00:06:57.851">DAVID CROCK SET ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.</p>
