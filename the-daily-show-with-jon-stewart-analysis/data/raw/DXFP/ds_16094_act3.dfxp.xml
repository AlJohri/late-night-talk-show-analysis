<p begin="00:00:44.278" end="00:00:46.113">WHY DOES McKINLEY GET NO LOVE?</p>

<p begin="00:00:52.419" end="00:00:56.557">THE LAST GUY IN THE TRIVIA QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.557" end="00:01:02.362">&gt;&gt; HE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING FOLLOWED BY ONE OF OUR MOST BELOVED AND CHARISMATIC </p>
<p begin="00:01:02.362" end="00:01:03.497">PRESIDENTS, THEODORE ROSE VEL,</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.497" end="00:01:07.935">AND McKINLEY, BECAUSE HE WAS ASSASSINATED, HE DIDN&apos;T LEAVE A LOT OF WRITTEN RECORD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.935" end="00:01:09.469">HIS WIFE WAS AN INHAVE A LID,</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.469" end="00:01:11.271">SHE DIDN&apos;T SURVIVE TO WRITE VERY MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.271" end="00:01:16.910">IF YOU LOOK AT HIS FIVE YEARS IN OFFICE FROM 1897 TO 1901, THEY WERE FILLED WITH GREAT DRAMA,</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.910" end="00:01:17.477">GREAT EXCITEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.477" end="00:01:19.980">HE LED THE U.S. INTO WAR WITH SPAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.980" end="00:01:27.955">HE TOOK OVER CUBA, PUERTO RICO AND...</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.955" end="00:01:28.355">&gt;&gt; </p>

<p begin="00:01:28.889" end="00:01:31.425">&gt;&gt; SMALL THINGS LIKE THAT.</p>

<p begin="00:01:33.160" end="00:01:38.265">IT WAS REALLY A DRAMATIC PERIOD IN AMERICAN HISTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.265" end="00:01:41.702">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND BATTLED TERROR AT HOME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.702" end="00:01:48.842">THE FELLA WHOS AS -- WHO ASSASSINATED HIM DISCOVERED AN,</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.842" end="00:01:49.977">AISM A FEW YEARS BEFORE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.977" end="00:01:56.283">HE WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THAT AMERICANS LABORED UNDER AT THIS TIME IN </p>
<p begin="00:01:56.283" end="00:01:57.951">THE LATTER PART OF 1900s.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.951" end="00:02:00.387">HE WAS LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION,</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.387" end="00:02:05.158">AND AN, ARCHISM APPEALED TO HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.158" end="00:02:12.533">HE WENT TO A SPEECH GIVEN BY EMMITT GOLDMAN IN 1901, MAY 1901, WHERE HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.533" end="00:02:19.473">HE SAID THAT HER WORDS MADE HIS SKULL HURT HE WAS SO TAKEN BY WHAT SHE SAID.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.473" end="00:02:20.974">&gt;&gt; Jon: ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR,</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.974" end="00:02:24.778">HIS SKULL PROBABLY HURT BEFOREHAND BECAUSE HE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A KNUCKLE HEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.778" end="00:02:27.114">&gt;&gt; HE WAS A BIT OF A LOANER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.114" end="00:02:32.152">&gt;&gt; Jon: I WAS STRUCK BY IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS, USUALLY EVEN IN THESE SITUATIONS, AN </p>
<p begin="00:02:32.152" end="00:02:33.587">ASSASSIN, THEY GO TO THE FAMILY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.587" end="00:02:35.122">EVERYBODY WHO IS FAMILY IS LIKE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.122" end="00:02:38.091">YEAH, WE NEVER LIKED THAT GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.091" end="00:02:40.861">HIS STEP DAD AND SISTER ARE LIKE, YEAH, THAT GUY WAS NUTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.861" end="00:02:42.596">I KNEW SOMETHING BAD WAS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.596" end="00:02:46.700">&gt;&gt; IT WAS VERY SAD WHEN THE NEWSPAPER REPORTERS DESCENDED ON THE FAMILY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.700" end="00:02:50.504">HIS STEPMOTHER IN PARTICULAR WAS LIKE, WE KNEW HE WAS NO GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.504" end="00:02:50.971">&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.971" end="00:02:56.276">&gt;&gt; THE ONLY THING THAT SURPRISED HIM WAS THAT HE HAD ENOUGH AMBITION AND ENERGY TO DO </p>
<p begin="00:02:56.276" end="00:02:56.977">SOMETHING LIKE THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.977" end="00:02:58.812">&gt;&gt; SHE SAID, THAT CAN&apos;T BE HIM,</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.812" end="00:03:00.047">HE&apos;S KIND OF A COWARD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.047" end="00:03:01.081">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.081" end="00:03:02.316">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT WAS CRAZY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.316" end="00:03:05.886">THE THEMES, YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS TRY AND LOOK BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.886" end="00:03:13.327">I ALWAYS LIKE TO IN MODERN TIMES WE GET THIS SENSE THAT WE&apos;RE ON THE PRECIPICE OF, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.327" end="00:03:16.296">UNPRECEDENTED DIFFICULTIES AND TENUOUS TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.296" end="00:03:20.901">PEOPLE BACK THEN COMPLAINED ABOUT THE UNPRECEDENTED,</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.901" end="00:03:25.672">TENUOUS, DIFFICULT TIME, THE VIOLENCE, THE TERROR, HOW WE HAD LOST OUR MORAL COMPASS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.672" end="00:03:29.176">HOW OFTEN DOES THAT... IT APPEARS TO HAVE REACHED A PEAK AT THAT TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.176" end="00:03:37.484">&gt;&gt; PEOPLE, ORDINARY AMERICANS WERE VERY AWARE AND VERY AFRAID OF ANARCHISTS IN THE 1890s.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.484" end="00:03:42.589">THERE HAD BEEN A STRING OF ATTACKS IN EUROPE AGAINST ROYAL HOUSEHOLD AND INDUSTRIALISTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.589" end="00:03:48.862">IN THE U.S., FOUR ANARCHISTS WERE HACKED BECAUSE OF THE MURDER OF A CHICAGO POLICEMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.862" end="00:03:54.968">IT WAS A LOONY TOON BOMB, A ROUND THING WAS A FUSE THEY HAD THROWN IN, KILLED A POLICEMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.968" end="00:04:02.743">A COUPLE YEARS LATER ANARCHISTS TRIED TO ASSASSINATE HENRY CLAY FRICK, A STEEL MAGNATE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.743" end="00:04:08.916">&gt;&gt; THE STORY OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO TRIED TO ASSASSINATE FRICK WHERE HE BASICALLY MAKES AN </p>
<p begin="00:04:08.916" end="00:04:15.222">APPOINTMENT WITH FRICK, BURSTS INTO HIS OFFICE, SHOOTS HIM TWICE IN THE NECK, STABS HIM,</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.222" end="00:04:16.523">WRESTLES HIM...</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.523" end="00:04:17.424">&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.424" end="00:04:19.893">&gt;&gt; Jon: GUY WALKS AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.893" end="00:04:22.896">&gt;&gt; FRICK WAS ONE TOUGH GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.896" end="00:04:24.164">&gt;&gt; Jon: I WAS GOING TO SAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.164" end="00:04:24.965">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.965" end="00:04:30.170">HE REFUSED ANAESTHESIA DURING THE OPERATION WHEN THEY REMOVED THE BULLETS FROM HIS NECK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.170" end="00:04:34.675">ONCE THEY STITCHED HIM UP, HE WENT BACK TO HIS DESK AND COMPLETED A BANK LOAN AND WROTE </p>
<p begin="00:04:34.675" end="00:04:36.977">A LETTER TO HIS MOM AND LIVED FOR DECADES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.977" end="00:04:42.516">&gt;&gt; Jon: HERE&apos;S THE CRAZY PART ABOUT THE LETTER, IT DIDN&apos;T MENTION THE SHOOTING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.516" end="00:04:49.389">BUT IT&apos;S LIKE, THEY&apos;RE PROBING HIS NECK, YEAH, THAT&apos;S IT, THAT HURTS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.389" end="00:04:50.190">UNBELIEVABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.190" end="00:04:59.299">IT&apos;S ALSO INTERESTING HOW THE SPEECH, YOU KNOW, ANARCHISTS COULD SPEAK OPENLY ABOUT </p>
<p begin="00:04:59.299" end="00:04:59.833">PRAISING KILLING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.833" end="00:05:02.569">IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT TIME IN AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.569" end="00:05:08.075">YOU IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS LESS FREEDOM OF SPEECH, BUT IN MANY WAYS IT WAS MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.075" end="00:05:15.516">EMMITT GOLDMAN WHO HE SITES, HE BASICALLY SAID, &quot;I KILLED McKINLEY BECAUSE EMMITT </p>
<p begin="00:05:15.516" end="00:05:19.152">GOLDMAN.&quot; THINK OF HOW WE ARE IN THIS SOCIETY, YET SHE STILL CONTINUED TO GIVE SPEECHES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.152" end="00:05:23.457">&gt;&gt; IT WAS A VERY FINE LINE THAT EMMITT GOLDMAN WALKED BETWEEN </p>
<p begin="00:05:23.457" end="00:05:28.495">DISAVOWING VIOLENCE AND THEN SHE ALSO OCCASIONALLY WOULD SHOW COMPASSION FOR ANARCHISTS WHO </p>
<p begin="00:05:28.495" end="00:05:29.630">HAD MURDERED SOMEBODY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.630" end="00:05:30.330">IT&apos;S VERY DIFFICULT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.330" end="00:05:34.334">SHE WAS VERY FAMOUS AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR GIVING SPEECHES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.334" end="00:05:36.837">SHE WAS OFTEN ARRESTED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.837" end="00:05:40.240">SHE KEPT A BOOK WITH HER BECAUSE SHE SPENT SO MANY NIGHTS IN JAIL </p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:41.875">SO SHE&apos;D HAVE SOMETHING TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.875" end="00:05:46.079">POLICE WOULD TAKE HER OUT OF JAIL IN THE MORNING AND SEND HER ON TO THE NEXT TOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.079" end="00:05:46.947">GET OUT OF OUR HAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.947" end="00:05:51.218">&gt;&gt; WERE THEY WORD SEARCHES?</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.218" end="00:05:51.585">JUMBLES?</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.585" end="00:05:53.387">JUST READING AND THAT SORT OF THING?</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.387" end="00:05:53.854">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.854" end="00:05:58.692">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS McKINLEY&apos;S LEGACY, WOULD YOU SAY, THE FACT THAT HIS ECONOMY USHERED US INTO </p>
<p begin="00:05:58.692" end="00:06:04.765">THE INDUSTRIAL AGE OR THAT HIS WARRING USHERED US INTO THE IMPERIAL AGE?</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.765" end="00:06:06.166">WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.166" end="00:06:08.335">&gt;&gt; I WOULD THINK THAT THE LATTER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.335" end="00:06:13.674">FOR THE FIRST TIME, UP UNTIL HIM, UP UNTIL McKINLEY, THE U.S. HAD BEEN VERY MUCH FOCUSED </p>
<p begin="00:06:13.674" end="00:06:16.443">ON SETTLING THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.443" end="00:06:19.947">WHEN HE WAS KILLED, FOR THE FIRST TIME THE U.S. HAD POSSESSIONS OVERSEAS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.947" end="00:06:21.048">WE HAD COLONIES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.048" end="00:06:23.050">THE PHILIPPINES WAS A VIRTUAL COLONY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.050" end="00:06:28.188">WE HAD DEVELOPED A POLICY WITH REGARD TO CHINA, THE OPEN-DOOR POLICY, WHICH REALLY GUIDED OUR </p>
<p begin="00:06:28.188" end="00:06:31.058">POLICY IN THE FAR EAST RIGHT UP UNTIL PEARL HARBOR.</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.058" end="00:06:37.331">SO HE REALLY INTRODUCED AMERICA TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND PROVIDED COMMITMENTS FOR US.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.331" end="00:06:40.968">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S THE NICEST WAY I&apos;VE EVER HEARD THAT PUT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.968" end="00:06:44.271">HE INTRODUCED US TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND COMMITMENTS,</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.271" end="00:06:46.907">COMMITMENTS WE STILL ENJOY TODAY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.907" end="00:06:49.977">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.977" end="00:06:51.745">&quot;THE PRESIDENT AND THE ASSASSIN&quot; ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.</p>
