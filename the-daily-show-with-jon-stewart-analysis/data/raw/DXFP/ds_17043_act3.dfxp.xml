<p begin="00:01:25.152" end="00:01:26.520">AND I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THAT.</p>

<p begin="00:01:58.519" end="00:01:59.853">AFFORD TO DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.853" end="00:02:05.392">SO ANYWAY CHRISTOPHERSON WHO PLAYS MY HUSBAND, HE DIES EARLY ON, HE IS THE CHOIR </p>
<p begin="00:02:05.392" end="00:02:10.898">DIRECTOR SO I THINK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE CHOIR, AND OF COURSE LA </p>
<p begin="00:02:10.898" end="00:02:13.267">FIV-- LATIFAH IS A GREAT SINGER AND THE COMMITTEE SAYS SHE SHOULD DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.267" end="00:02:14.635">SO OF COURSE THE RUB STARTS THERE.</p>

<p begin="00:02:18.872" end="00:02:22.609">A LOT OF LAUGHS T IS A COMEDY AS WELL, HEART AND SOUL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.609" end="00:02:27.548">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW MUCH, HOW MANY ROLLS DID YOU THROW AT QUEEN LATIFAH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.548" end="00:02:30.717">&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY T TOOK A DAY AND A HALF TO DO THAT SCENE BECAUSE IT WAS A LONG SCENE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.717" end="00:02:32.352">OF COURSE, A LOT OF FOOD,</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.352" end="00:02:33.220">THROWING FOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.220" end="00:02:37.157">BUT I PUT 24 ROLLS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.157" end="00:02:38.859">BUT HI A PRETTY GOOD AIM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.859" end="00:02:40.227">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DOT TO TELL YOU,</p>

<p begin="00:02:42.262" end="00:02:45.666">LET ME ASK YOU THIS, SHE BLOCKED A COUPLE OF THEM WITH THE TRAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.666" end="00:02:47.734">HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU POP HER.</p>

<p begin="00:02:55.375" end="00:03:00.113">I USED TO PLAY WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO PLAY SOFTBALL AND I CAN HIT A GOLF BALL </p>
<p begin="00:03:00.113" end="00:03:01.849">PRETTY GOOD SO ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE HANDS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.849" end="00:03:04.885">SO I WAS BANG HER PRETTY GOOD BUT SHE DESERVE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.885" end="00:03:07.321">SHE DESERVED EVERY ROLL I PUT ON HER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.321" end="00:03:12.059">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DON&apos;T THINK ANYONE WOULD THINK SHE DIDN&apos;T DESERVE YOUR THROWING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.059" end="00:03:17.130">BUT SHE DOESN&apos;T REALIZE-- NOW, YOU ARE IN STATURE OBVIOUSLY A LEGEND IN THE BUSINESS BUT </p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:19.766">PHYSICALLY, A SMALLER INDIVIDUAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.766" end="00:03:22.903">LATIFAH IS, IF I MAY, ALSO A LEGEND IN THE INDUSTRY BUT A LARGER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.903" end="00:03:25.973">WAS THERE EVER-- WAS THERE PHYSICAL FIGHTING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.973" end="00:03:26.673">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.673" end="00:03:30.811">SHE GETS ME IN A CHOKE HOLD AND I&apos;M THIS TINY LITTLE THING DOWN HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.811" end="00:03:35.883">I CALL IT BIGGIE SMALL FROM THAT WORD.</p>

<p begin="00:03:39.686" end="00:03:41.088">ME IN A CHOKE HOLD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.088" end="00:03:43.824">SHE&apos;S GOT ME, SHE COULD HAVE HURT ME BAD IF SHE HAD WANTED TO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.824" end="00:03:44.825">BUT SHE DIDN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.825" end="00:03:45.225">SHE&apos;S GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.225" end="00:03:48.228">SHE IS BIG, 5, 9, 5, 10.</p>
