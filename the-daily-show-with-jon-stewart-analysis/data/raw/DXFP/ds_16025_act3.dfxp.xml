<p begin="00:01:13.240" end="00:01:14.074">HOW ARE YOU DOING?</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.074" end="00:01:15.409">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.409" end="00:01:20.480">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE JUST WITNESSED &quot;OUR AMERICA.&quot; WHAT ARE THE ASPECTS OF &quot;OUR </p>
<p begin="00:01:20.480" end="00:01:22.983">AMERICA &quot;THAT YOU SOUGHT TO UNCOVER TO FURTHER EXPLORE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.983" end="00:01:27.020">&gt;&gt; WELL THE PURPOSE OF THE SERIES IS TO BE SORT OF A WINDOW INTO DIFFERENT ASPECTS </p>
<p begin="00:01:27.020" end="00:01:28.922">OF AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.922" end="00:01:33.026">WE COVER SOME TOPICS THAT COULD BE CONTROVERSIAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.026" end="00:01:39.933">I MEAN THIS SHOW THAT IS AIRING TONIGHT IS CALLED TRANSGENDERED LIFES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.933" end="00:01:45.772">YOU JUST SAW A PERSON BORN AS A WOMAN AND NEVER IDENTIFIED WITH BEING A WOMAN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.772" end="00:01:49.376">HE&apos;S BEEN UNDERGOING HORMONE TREATMENTS AND SO ON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.376" end="00:01:52.646">AS YOU CAN SEE MADE SOME PRETTY TREMENDOUS PROGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.646" end="00:01:57.317">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT HORMONES WOULD GIVE YOU THAT IF YOU WERE WORKING OUT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.317" end="00:01:58.151">LIKE WHAT WOULD....</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.151" end="00:02:00.120">&gt;&gt; I WISH I COULD TELL YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.120" end="00:02:03.190">BUT IT&apos;S OBVIOUSLY WORKING FOR HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.190" end="00:02:05.626">IT&apos;S A REALLY BEAUTIFUL SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.626" end="00:02:09.363">WE COVER PEOPLE AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF TRANSITION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.363" end="00:02:15.936">INCLUDING A SIX-YEAR-OLD CHILD WHO WAS BORN HARRY BUT NEVER IDENTIFIED AS A BOY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.936" end="00:02:19.940">&gt;&gt; Jon: AT WHAT AGE DO THEY SAY SOMEONE WOULD FIND THEIR GENDER IDENTITY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.940" end="00:02:22.609">COULD IT BE AT 6 OR EVEN EARLIER THAN THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.609" end="00:02:30.517">&gt;&gt; WELL, HARRY WHO NOW GOES BY HALEY, HE CHANGED HIS CHANGE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.517" end="00:02:36.857">BUT HER PARENTS AND THEY&apos;RE RAISING HER AS A GIRL BECAUSE SHE REFUSES TO BE CALLED A BOY </p>
<p begin="00:02:36.857" end="00:02:38.025">OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.025" end="00:02:39.393">THEY SAID AS SOON AS....</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.393" end="00:02:42.262">&gt;&gt; Jon: WERE THEY PREPARED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.262" end="00:02:44.598">&gt;&gt; NO ONE CAN EVER PREPARE, I DON&apos;T THINK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.598" end="00:02:49.002">IN FACT, WE REACHED OUT TO HUNDREDS OF PARENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.002" end="00:02:51.205">NOBODY WANTED TO BE ON CAMERA EXCEPT FOR THIS COUPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.205" end="00:02:55.008">THEY SAID THAT THEY LIVE IN THIS REALLY SAFE COMMUNITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.008" end="00:02:59.446">IF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SAFE COMMUNITIES DON&apos;T SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT </p>
<p begin="00:02:59.446" end="00:03:04.585">IN SAFE COMMUNITIES, THEN THESE KIDS COULD END... BE DESTINED FOR LIVES OF TORTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.585" end="00:03:09.456">IT&apos;S REALLY... I MEAN IT RAISES A QUESTION, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOUR CHILD NEVER </p>
<p begin="00:03:09.456" end="00:03:12.359">IDENTIFIED WITH THE GENDER HE OR SHE WAS BORN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.359" end="00:03:17.464">WOULD YOU ALLOW... WOULD YOU RAISE YOUR CHILD AS A DIFFERENT GENDER?</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.464" end="00:03:20.067">HALEY&apos;S FATHER IS A FAIRLY RELIGIOUS MAN, CONSERVATIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.067" end="00:03:26.907">HE SAID THAT IT REALLY STRUCK AT EVERYTHING THAT HE OR CHANGED EVERYTHING HE LEARNED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.907" end="00:03:29.409">HE IS A CHURCH-GOING MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.409" end="00:03:33.947">KIND OF GREW UP FEELING LIKE GAY PEOPLE, TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE, THERE&apos;S SOMETHING </p>
<p begin="00:03:33.947" end="00:03:34.648">WRONG WITH THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.648" end="00:03:36.717">THEY&apos;RE SINFUL UNTIL IT HAPPENED TO HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.717" end="00:03:39.520">HE JUST HAS BECOME SO LOVING AND INDECREEDIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.520" end="00:03:41.088">I REALLY ADMIRE THESE PARENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.088" end="00:03:41.955">&gt;&gt; Jon: ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.955" end="00:03:43.757">WHAT&apos;S YOUR NEXT STORY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.757" end="00:03:46.159">AS FAR AS I&apos;M CONCERNED YOUR SHOW IS DONE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:47.227">WHAT&apos;S NEXT AFTER THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.227" end="00:03:48.929">WHAT&apos;S THE NEXT ONE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.929" end="00:03:55.002">&gt;&gt; THE NEXT EPISODE WE VISIT A COLONY IN CENTRAL FLORIDA OR IN THE WOODS OF FLORIDA THAT </p>
<p begin="00:03:55.002" end="00:03:56.770">CONSISTS OF SEX OFFENDERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.770" end="00:03:59.139">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS DOESN&apos;T SEEM AS WARM AND FUZZY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.139" end="00:04:00.807">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S NOT AS WARM AND FUZZY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.807" end="00:04:05.012">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE OTHER ONE FELT LIKE MY HEART WAS OPENING UP.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.012" end="00:04:08.382">AND I THOUGHT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE ACCEPTANCE THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS FOR THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.382" end="00:04:09.616">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S NONE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.616" end="00:04:13.620">THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE OVER 700,000 REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.620" end="00:04:14.688">&gt;&gt; Jon: IN THIS ONE TOWN?</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.688" end="00:04:15.856">&gt;&gt; NO, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.856" end="00:04:18.625">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOLY (BEEP).</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.625" end="00:04:21.361">I THINK THAT MIGHT BE TAMPA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.361" end="00:04:22.596">YOU&apos;RE KIDDING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.596" end="00:04:24.364">A JOKE, A JOKE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.364" end="00:04:27.835">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE NOT FAR FROM TAMPA BUT I WON&apos;T BE TOO SPECIFIC.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.835" end="00:04:30.437">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN THIS COLONY?</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.437" end="00:04:35.075">&gt;&gt; IN THE ONE WE VISITED ABOUT 30 BUT THERE ARE ALLEGEDLY HUNDREDS WHO LIVE IN THE WOODS </p>
<p begin="00:04:35.075" end="00:04:37.611">OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.611" end="00:04:41.381">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN DISTANCE AWAY FROM....</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.381" end="00:04:41.815">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.815" end="00:04:46.053">&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRUE SEX OFFENDERS OR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LABELED </p>
<p begin="00:04:46.053" end="00:04:47.354">AS SUCH DUE TO....</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.354" end="00:04:48.755">&gt;&gt; NO, THESE ARE....</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.755" end="00:04:50.224">&gt;&gt; Jon: CERTAIN LEGALITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.224" end="00:04:53.026">&gt;&gt; THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED TIME FOR....</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.026" end="00:04:53.727">&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.727" end="00:04:59.499">&gt;&gt; IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA YOU HAVE TO LIVE BEYOND 1500 FEET OR 2500 FROM WHERE CHILDREN CONGREGATE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.499" end="00:05:02.369">SO THEY&apos;RE BEING PUSHED ESSENTIALLY INTO THE WOODS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.369" end="00:05:07.341">WHAT THEY TOLD ME IS THAT IF A SEX OFFENDER REALLY WANTED TO OFFEND HE OR SHE WILL FIND A </p>
<p begin="00:05:07.341" end="00:05:08.775">WAY TO DO SO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.775" end="00:05:12.513">DO THESE LAWS ACTUALLY MAKE US SAFER OR MAKE US FEEL SAFER?</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.513" end="00:05:18.118">&gt;&gt; Jon: I ALWAYS FELT LIKE THE NAME OFFENDER ALWAYS STRUCK ME AS SLIGHTLY LOWERING YOUR </p>
<p begin="00:05:18.118" end="00:05:20.254">EXPECTATION ABOUT WHAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS DO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.254" end="00:05:25.659">LIKE IT&apos;S NOT LIKE PEOPLE GET OFFENDED WHEN YOU GO LIKE (BEEP): THAT&apos;S OFFENSIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.659" end="00:05:26.660">THAT OFFENDED ME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.660" end="00:05:30.564">WHAT THEY&apos;RE DOING IS, WE SHOULD COME UP WITH A BETTER TERM LIKE....</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.564" end="00:05:32.165">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.165" end="00:05:34.868">&gt;&gt; Jon: (BEEP).</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.868" end="00:05:39.907">&gt;&gt; THEY CERTAINLY ARE OUR COUNTRIES PIRAHAS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.907" end="00:05:43.877">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT MAY BE THE HARDEST GROUP TO FIND EMPATHY FOR ME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.877" end="00:05:47.915">FOR ME I FIND THAT A DIFFICULT GROUP TO... YOU KNOW, YOU&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT </p>
<p begin="00:05:47.915" end="00:05:49.249">COMMIT RAPE OR DO THINGS TO CHILDREN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.249" end="00:05:51.485">I HAVE DIFFICULTIES BEING LIKE,</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.485" end="00:05:54.188">I&apos;D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.188" end="00:06:00.427">&gt;&gt; OUR INTENTION ISN&apos;T TO TRY AND INSPIRE EMPATHY BY ANY MEANS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.427" end="00:06:01.562">FOR SEX OFFENDERS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.562" end="00:06:06.099">IT&apos;S JUST TO ALLOY YOU TO UNDERSTAND THEIR... TO ALLOW YOU TO UNDERSTAND THEIR WORLD </p>
<p begin="00:06:06.099" end="00:06:07.000">A LITTLE BIT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.000" end="00:06:11.038">IF WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE ON THE PERIPHERY WE CAN&apos;T REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.038" end="00:06:15.542">IN A WAY WHAT WE&apos;RE TRYING TO DO IS TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE FACT THAT THESE ARE ALSO </p>
<p begin="00:06:15.542" end="00:06:18.312">AMERICANS WHO COULD POSSIBLY LIVE NEXT DOOR TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.312" end="00:06:22.049">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU ARE DOING WHAT A GOOD JOURNALIST DOES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.049" end="00:06:22.850">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE TRYING TO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.850" end="00:06:30.924">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND I AM DOING WHAT PEOPLE WHO CANNOT BE IN YOUR BUSINESS DO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.924" end="00:06:35.028">THAT&apos;S VERY ADMIRABLE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT OBJECTIVE POINT OF VIEW AND </p>
<p begin="00:06:35.028" end="00:06:35.829">KEEP US INFORMED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.829" end="00:06:40.133">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE TRYING TO HAVE EXPERIENCES THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.133" end="00:06:44.905">&gt;&gt; Jon: COME BACK AND SEE US AGAIN AS THE SERIES KEEPS GOING BECAUSE I&apos;D LOVE TO KEEP </p>
