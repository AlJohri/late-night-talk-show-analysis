<p begin="00:00:16.016" end="00:00:20.988">WE SAVED A LITTLE TIME AND I THOUGHT IT WORKED OUT VERY NICELY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.988" end="00:00:23.957">SENATOR, ARE YOU HAVING A NICE TIME AT YOUR PARTY&apos;S PARTY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.957" end="00:00:24.424">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>

<p begin="00:00:26.426" end="00:00:28.896">&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT MICHELLE OBAMA WAS AMAZING LAST NIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.896" end="00:00:31.398">DID YOU GUYS THINK SHE WAS AMAZING?</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.398" end="00:00:32.566">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) INCREDIBLE!</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.566" end="00:00:33.133">SO MOVING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.133" end="00:00:34.635">SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SPEECH.</p>

<p begin="00:00:39.306" end="00:00:40.240">15,000 PEOPLE IN THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.240" end="00:00:46.613">HOW DOES IT FEEL IN THAT HALL BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE CAN&apos;T GET PASSES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.613" end="00:00:49.349">(LAUGHTER) SO WAS IT VERY EMOTIONAL FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE THEATER?</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.349" end="00:00:51.785">&gt;&gt; WELL, I WATCHED HER SPEECH FROM TELEVISION AND...</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.785" end="00:00:55.422">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, YOU DON&apos;T HAVE PASSES?</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.422" end="00:00:56.757">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:00:56.757" end="00:00:59.259">&gt;&gt; (LAUGHS) (LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.259" end="00:01:00.961">&gt;&gt; Jon: I WILL WORK ON THAT FOR YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.961" end="00:01:02.429">I WILL GET YOU SOME PASSES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.429" end="00:01:04.565">&gt;&gt; BUT THEY SHOWED ALL THE WOMEN CRYING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.565" end="00:01:09.837">SHE REALLY CONNECTED WITH PEOPLE AND TALKED ABOUT EVERYDAY PEOPLE AND THEIR STRUGGLES AND WHAT IT </p>
<p begin="00:01:09.837" end="00:01:12.873">MEANS TO BE... WHAT HER VALUES ARE, WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA&apos;S VALUES ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.873" end="00:01:14.208">I THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.208" end="00:01:16.577">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S INTERESTING, TOO,</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.577" end="00:01:20.414">BECAUSE WITHIN THERE THERE&apos;S ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THERE&apos;S NOT THAT MUCH ENTHUSIASM FOR THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:20.414" end="00:01:25.619">DEMOCRATS BUT WHEN YOU WATCH IT ON TELEVISION-- AND I WAS JUST DOWN IN TAMPA, THERE SEEMED TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:25.619" end="00:01:32.125">BE A PALPABLE ELECTRICITY THAT WAS SOMEWHAT MISSING FROM THE OTHER...</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.125" end="00:01:32.559">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.559" end="00:01:37.397">AND NOT TO CALL IT &quot;MORIBUND&quot; OR...</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.397" end="00:01:41.168">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.168" end="00:01:43.103">&quot;ZOMBIESQUE&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.103" end="00:01:48.342">(LAUGHTER) OR A CRUISE SHIP THAT HAD BEEN STRUCK WITH A TERRIBLE STOMACH FLU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.342" end="00:01:53.881">(LAUGHTER) IT WAS NOW JUST CIRCLING CURACAO FOR TWO TO THREE DAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.881" end="00:01:56.917">BUT IT SEEMED TO BE A VERY ELECTRIC ATMOSPHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.917" end="00:01:57.885">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.885" end="00:02:02.389">(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:02:02.389" end="00:02:04.057">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT&apos;S YOUR SENSE...</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.057" end="00:02:08.061">YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY&apos;S TALKING ABOUT WOMEN, THEY&apos;RE THE... BOY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.061" end="00:02:12.299">THAT&apos;S THE... AS THOUGH IT&apos;S A SORT OF A... THIS BLOCK OF...</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.299" end="00:02:16.803">OH, WE KNOW IT&apos;S UP FOR GRAB THIS IS YEAR, WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.803" end="00:02:20.107">(LAUGHTER) WHAT&apos;S YOUR SENSE OF THAT DEMOGRAPHIC AND WHAT&apos;S GOING ON?</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.107" end="00:02:24.344">&gt;&gt; I THINK WOMEN&apos;S VOICES ARE GOING TO BE UNBELIEVABLY IMPORTANT TO THIS ELECTION AND I </p>
<p begin="00:02:24.344" end="00:02:28.348">HOPE THAT EVERY WOMAN WATCHING WILL VOTE!</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.348" end="00:02:35.255">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I THINK...</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.255" end="00:02:38.192">&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, THEY&apos;RE ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.192" end="00:02:40.460">I THINK THERE&apos;S A REAL CHOICE AND THERE&apos;S A REAL DIFFERENCE </p>
<p begin="00:02:40.460" end="00:02:45.299">ABOUT VALUES AND WHO WE&apos;RE FIGHTING FOR AND I THINK WOMEN ARE FUNDAMENTALLY ENGAGED IN </p>
<p begin="00:02:45.299" end="00:02:49.937">THIS ELECTION NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ISSUES BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:49.937" end="00:02:50.704">ECONOMIC ISSUES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.704" end="00:02:53.507">EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.507" end="00:02:55.175">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S A BIG ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.175" end="00:03:00.247">THE EQUAL PAY THING STRIKES ME AS HOW IS THAT ENFORCED... I&apos;VE READ THINGS THAT AT THE WHITE </p>
<p begin="00:03:00.247" end="00:03:04.051">HOUSE, THE WOMEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE DON&apos;T MAKE THE SAME MONEY THAT MEN DO IN THE SAME POSITIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.051" end="00:03:11.225">IF THAT CAN&apos;T TKPW B DONE AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE THEY SIGNED THE LAW WHAT HOPE DO WE HAVE...</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.225" end="00:03:18.098">DOES HE WALK AROUND AND GO &quot;LET ME SEE YOUR CHECK.&quot; HOW DO YOU ENFORCE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.098" end="00:03:21.502">LILY LEDBETTER SAID HERSELF &quot;I DIDN&apos;T KNOW FOR 20 YEARS.&quot; THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.502" end="00:03:24.238">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S WHY THE FIRST BILL PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED WAS THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:24.238" end="00:03:28.976">LILY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT AND THAT ALLOWS WOMEN AS SOON AS THEY FIND OUT THAT THEY&apos;VE BEEN </p>
<p begin="00:03:28.976" end="00:03:31.445">DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN PAY THEN THEY CAN FILE A LAWSUIT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.445" end="00:03:35.949">IT DOESN&apos;T HAVE TO BE WHEN IT STARTED BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW FOR 20 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.949" end="00:03:40.787">SO THAT GIVES WOMEN MORE EMPOWERMENT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR THEMSELVES AND FIGHT FOR </p>
<p begin="00:03:40.787" end="00:03:45.626">FAIR PAY AND EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.626" end="00:03:46.093">(APPLAUSE).</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.093" end="00:03:49.263">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU THINK WE&apos;LL SEE A DAY IN THE SENATE WHERE IT&apos;S MORE EQUAL?</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.263" end="00:03:53.133">EVEN NOW YOU LOOK AT THE SENATE AND THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY FEMALE VOICES IN THE SENATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.133" end="00:03:53.734">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.734" end="00:03:55.602">LOOK, WE ONLY HAVE 17 WOMEN IN THE SENATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.602" end="00:03:56.803">WE ONLY HAVE 17%.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.803" end="00:04:00.807">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND YET WOMEN ARE 18% OF THE...</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.807" end="00:04:03.744">&gt;&gt; 51%!</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.744" end="00:04:04.044">51!</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.044" end="00:04:05.078">THIS IS WHAT I OFTEN SAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.078" end="00:04:10.951">IF WE HAD 51% OF WOMEN IN CONGRESS, DO YOU THINK WE&apos;D BE DEBATING BIRTH CONTROL?</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.951" end="00:04:16.256">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO!</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.256" end="00:04:21.428">WE&apos;D BE DEBATING THE ECONOMY AND JOBS AND HOW WE CREATE ECONOMIC ENGINES AND HELP OUR SMALL </p>
<p begin="00:04:21.428" end="00:04:24.965">BUSINESSES AND NATIONAL SECURITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT REALLY,</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.965" end="00:04:25.866">REALLY MATTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.866" end="00:04:29.269">AND SO WE NEED MORE WOMEN IN CONGRESS!</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.269" end="00:04:29.870">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.870" end="00:04:34.374">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO WHAT YOU&apos;RE BASICALLY SAYING IS IF WE HAD MORE WOMEN IN CONGRESS THEY </p>
<p begin="00:04:34.374" end="00:04:36.476">WOULDN&apos;T COME UP WITH DISTRACTING TYPE ISSUES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.476" end="00:04:38.712">THAT THEY WOULD BE MORE FOCUSED ON REAL ISSUES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.712" end="00:04:42.749">&gt;&gt; AND ONE OTHER THING...</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.749" end="00:04:43.183">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.183" end="00:04:45.719">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE GOING LET ME GET AWAY WITH THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.719" end="00:04:49.823">&gt;&gt; WELL, WOMEN ARE OFTEN VERY GOOD AT BUILDING BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.823" end="00:04:53.427">WE&apos;RE GOOD LISTENERS, WE BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.427" end="00:04:56.296">(LAUGHTER) IS THAT NOT TRUE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.296" end="00:04:57.431">THE THAT NOT TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.431" end="00:05:00.400">&gt;&gt; Jon: SOMEBODY&apos;S GOT TO CHANGE THE LIGHTBULBS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:02.803">(AUDIENCE REACTS) WAIT A MINUTE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.803" end="00:05:09.409">SHE JUST (BLEEP) ON MEN AS BEING ABLE TO FIND CONSENSUS AND COMPROMISE AND I MAKE A JOKE </p>
<p begin="00:05:09.409" end="00:05:14.181">ABOUT WELL, AT LEAST WE CAN CHANGE A LIGHTBULB AND YOU&apos;RE LIKE &quot;THAT&apos;S SEXIST&quot;?</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.317" end="00:05:20.654">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, IT&apos;S NOT MALE VOICES... MALE VOICES ARE IMPORTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.654" end="00:05:22.956">IT&apos;S THE COMBINATION OF THEM...</p>
