<p begin="00:00:50.984" end="00:00:56.223">I WAS OFFENDED BY RICKY GERVAIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.223" end="00:01:00.394">I WAS OFFENDED THAT A COMEDIAN COULD BE THAT FUNNY.</p>

<p begin="00:02:26.947" end="00:02:29.583">HE GRACIOUSLY AGREED WE&apos;RE GOING TO SIT TOGETHER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.583" end="00:02:32.819">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, MY GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.819" end="00:02:35.222">YOU&apos;RE GOING TO SIT TOGETHER FOR TWO HOURS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.222" end="00:02:49.837">HEY, HOW MANY OF US HAVE TO GET (BEEP) TO GO TO LUNCH?</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.837" end="00:02:56.777">AND IN LIGHT OF CURRENT EVENTS TONIGHT I WILL NOT REFER TO THE CAUCUS ACROSS THE AISLE AS </p>

<p begin="00:02:58.078" end="00:02:59.646">LISTEN, IT&apos;S A START.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.646" end="00:03:06.119">BY THE WAY THAT WAS A NICE CONGRESSIONAL... WHAT COULD GO WRONG WITH THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.119" end="00:03:07.955">OH, NO!</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.955" end="00:03:09.189">THAT&apos;S EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.189" end="00:03:10.757">NO!</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.757" end="00:03:13.527">CIVIL DISCOURSE MAKING HUGE STRIDES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.527" end="00:03:14.828">HOW ABOUT HONOR DISCOURSE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.828" end="00:03:18.832">&gt;&gt; THE FIRST PIECE OF BUSINESS IS WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A NASTY BATTLE OVER HEALTH CARE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.832" end="00:03:24.605">IN FACT THE REPUBLICAN BILL IS EVEN CALLED &quot;REPEAL OF THE JOB- KILLING HEALTH CARE LAW.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:24.605" end="00:03:30.777">&gt;&gt; Jon: TO BE FAIR, AFTER ALL THE TALK OF DEATH PANELS WE SHOULD THANKFUL THAT THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:30.777" end="00:03:36.250">REPUBLICANS DIDN&apos;T DIDN&apos;T GO WITH THE REPEAL OF THE GRANDMA KILLING HEALTH CARE LAW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.250" end="00:03:39.152">THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PLACE FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO START THE CONVERSATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.152" end="00:03:43.390">&gt;&gt; THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOW REALLY TAKING ISSUE WITH THE JOB-KILLING PART OF THE TITLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.390" end="00:03:46.860">&gt;&gt; Jon: DEMOCRATS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.860" end="00:03:48.095">FOCUS IN ON SUBSTANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.095" end="00:03:51.098">&gt;&gt; THEY SAY IN LIGHT OF TUCSON,</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.098" end="00:03:54.535">GET ANY KILLING OUT OF ANY TITLE ANYWHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.535" end="00:03:55.135">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.135" end="00:03:56.270">NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.270" end="00:03:58.672">NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.672" end="00:04:04.278">IF IT COSTS JOBS NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO SAY IT COST JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.278" end="00:04:07.147">IF YOU DO THAT, YOU GET THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.147" end="00:04:12.486">&gt;&gt; THE NEW SPEAKER BOEHNER SAID YESTERDAY HE TALKED ABOUT LEGISLATION HE CALLED IT </p>
<p begin="00:04:12.486" end="00:04:17.324">JOB... WE&apos;RE GOING TO STOP THIS JOB-DESTROYING LEGISLATION INSTEAD OF CALLING </p>
<p begin="00:04:17.324" end="00:04:18.892">IT JOB-KILLING LEGISLATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.892" end="00:04:25.465">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M GLAD THAT SPEAKER BOEHNER CHOSE TO VERBALIZE A DIFFERENT TITLE FOR THAT BILL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.465" end="00:04:31.638">BUT THEY SO FAR HAVE REFUSED TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THE TITLE OF JOB-KILLING HEALTH CARE REPEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.638" end="00:04:38.145">&gt;&gt; Jon: AS A DEMOCRAT I INSIST YOU REFER TO HEALTH CARE REFORM NOT AS JOB-KILLING BUT </p>
<p begin="00:04:38.145" end="00:04:39.713">AS JOB-DESTROYING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.713" end="00:04:42.115">BUT OF COURSE I&apos;M A MODERATE DEMOCRAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.115" end="00:04:49.556">MY MORE LIBERAL COLLEAGUES INSIST THAT IT BE CALLED JOB- EVAPORATING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.556" end="00:04:52.526">WHY DO YOU LET THEM DO THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.526" end="00:05:01.435">THEY GOT TO CALL THE 2002 IRAQ WAR BILL A DIFFERENT NAME NOT THE TOTALLY AVOIDABLE WAR OF </p>
<p begin="00:05:01.435" end="00:05:04.905">CHOICE ENDLESS CLUSTER (BEEP) CREATION ACT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.905" end="00:05:06.840">YOU BLEW YOUR SHOT.</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.475" end="00:05:08.976">WHATEVER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.976" end="00:05:10.611">YOU BLEW IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.611" end="00:05:12.346">JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.346" end="00:05:14.381">DOES HEALTH CARE REFORM KILL,</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.381" end="00:05:18.285">DESTROY, SLOWLY SOP UP JOBS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.285" end="00:05:24.291">WELL ACCORDING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE IT WILL CREATE A .5% DECREASE IN THE LABOR FORCE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.291" end="00:05:28.962">DUE TO OLDER WORKERS BEING ABLE TO RETIRE EARLIER BECAUSE THEY DON&apos;T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT </p>
<p begin="00:05:28.962" end="00:05:34.001">THEIR HEALTH CARE AND OTHERS VOLUNTARILY LEAVING THEIR WORK FORCE OR REDUCING THEIR HOURS </p>
<p begin="00:05:34.001" end="00:05:45.045">SO IT IS JOB KILLING IN THE SENSE THAT GETTING MORE SLEEP AT NIGHT IS AWAKE KILLING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.045" end="00:05:48.048">THE ACCURACY ARGUMENT COULD BENEFIT THE DEMOCRATS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.048" end="00:05:52.152">THE SEMANTIC ARGUMENT CANNOT BENEFIT THE DEMOCRATS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.152" end="00:05:55.255">FOX AND FRIENDS MAKE THAT POINTS EXPLICIT FOR US.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.255" end="00:05:57.457">&gt;&gt; MR. WEANER LET&apos;S START WITH YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.457" end="00:06:02.196">YOU THINK THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE TONE DEAF BY CALLING IT THE REPEALING THE JOB-KILLING </p>
<p begin="00:06:02.196" end="00:06:03.163">HEALTH CARE LAW ACT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.163" end="00:06:03.497">WHY?</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.497" end="00:06:07.267">&gt;&gt; WELL IT&apos;S NOT ONLY THE WRONG TONE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK </p>
<p begin="00:06:07.267" end="00:06:08.902">AT WHAT&apos;S IN THE BILL IT&apos;S JUST WRONG.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.902" end="00:06:11.872">THE BILL CREATES 300,000 NEW JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.872" end="00:06:17.845">THERE ARE 160 AMENDMENTS THAT DEMOCRATS PUT IN THE BILL THAT ARE MOSTLY TAX BREAKS FOR </p>

<p begin="00:06:59.019" end="00:07:02.322">PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO HIT OUR ECONOMY IN A LIFETIME.</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.322" end="00:07:03.824">&gt;&gt; I&apos;LL GIVE YOU THE FINAL WORD.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.824" end="00:07:07.427">&gt;&gt; LET&apos;S FOCUS ON THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE BILL ALLOWS....</p>
