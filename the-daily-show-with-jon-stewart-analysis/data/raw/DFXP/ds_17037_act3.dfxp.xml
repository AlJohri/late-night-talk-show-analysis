<p begin="00:04:05.045" end="00:04:08.148">&gt;&gt; WE CAN&apos;T DO THAT BECAUSE WE&apos;RE BROTHERS AND WE DON&apos;T KNOW HOW TO SKATE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.148" end="00:04:10.484">(LAUGHTER) SO WE DON&apos;T DO THAT.</p>

<p begin="00:04:18.258" end="00:04:23.063">... YOU THEN TAKE THE BASKETBALL COURT UP, REPLACE IT WITH ICE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.063" end="00:04:27.968">EVERYBODY WAITS AROUND FOR HOWEVER LONG THAT TAKES AND THEN YOU SKATE BUT I APPRECIATE YOU </p>

<p begin="00:04:44.184" end="00:04:46.153">&gt;&gt; Jon: DANNY SHEAS COULDN&apos;T DUNK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.153" end="00:04:48.088">DO YOU BELIEVE DANNY CHAISE COULD DUNK?</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.088" end="00:04:50.224">THAT WAS AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.224" end="00:04:55.128">HE COULD LIFT HIS ARM UP AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE HE WAS DUNKING BUT IF YOU LOOKED, NO GAP </p>
<p begin="00:04:55.128" end="00:04:57.097">BETWEEN HIS SHOES AND THE FLOOR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.097" end="00:04:59.266">(LAUGHTER) IT&apos;S VERY SAD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.266" end="00:05:01.034">WHO&apos;S GOING TO BE THE BEST TEAM THIS YEAR?</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.034" end="00:05:02.503">WHO ARE YOU LIKING?</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.503" end="00:05:04.471">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A GREAT QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.471" end="00:05:09.042">I&apos;M NOT... THE TWO BEST TEAMS RIGHT NOW TO ME ARE CHICAGO AND MIAMI.</p>

<p begin="00:05:12.045" end="00:05:18.285">(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:05:18.285" end="00:05:21.421">&gt;&gt; I REALLY THINK IT&apos;S SOMETHING IN THE WATER IN NEW YORK.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.421" end="00:05:28.061">BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK HAVE SUCH AN INFLATED EGO WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR TEAM.</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.234" end="00:05:34.868">IT&apos;S DESPERATION.</p>
