<p begin="00:04:22.796" end="00:04:28.635">&gt;&gt; AND THEN I THINK CAMERON CROWE DIRECTED IT AND PEOPLE GO [BLEEP] WHY DIDN&apos;T YOU </p>
<p begin="00:04:28.635" end="00:04:30.637">TELL ME THAT TO BEGIN WITH.</p>

<p begin="00:04:40.914" end="00:04:44.318">EMUS, THEY&apos;RE ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.318" end="00:04:48.121">&gt;&gt; THE GRIZZLY BEAR WAS THE MOST -- THE GRIZZLY BEAR,</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.121" end="00:04:49.823">HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A GRIZZLY BEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.823" end="00:04:53.560">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME, I LIVE IN NEW YORK, OF COURSE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.560" end="00:04:56.096">THERE&apos;S ONE THAT OWNS A DELI NEAR MY HOUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.096" end="00:04:57.130">I GO THERE ALL THE TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.130" end="00:04:59.700">&gt;&gt; NO I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE UP CLOSE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.700" end="00:05:01.735">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW BIG IS A GRIZZLY BEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.735" end="00:05:05.506">&gt;&gt; WHEN HE STOOT UP HE WAS 12 AND A HALF FEET TALL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.506" end="00:05:10.444">AND THE ONLY THING I KNEW ABOUT GRIZZLY BEARS WAS THE STORY, MY FATHER HAD TOLD MOW A STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.444" end="00:05:17.451">HE HAD TAKEN A FISHING TRIP IN 1986, SO HE AND HIS FRIENDS WENT TO ALASKA, AND </p>
<p begin="00:05:17.451" end="00:05:21.889">THIS GUY TOOK THEM AROUND AND THE GUIDE HAD A 44 MAGNUM IN A HOLSTER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.889" end="00:05:25.792">AND MY DAD LOOKED AT IT AND HE NOTICED THAT THE SIGHT WAS FILED DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.792" end="00:05:27.661">AND HE SAID I CAN ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THE GUN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.661" end="00:05:29.796">AND THE GUY GOES GOES YEAH,</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.796" end="00:05:30.097">SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.097" end="00:05:31.465">IS THAT FOR GRIZZLY BEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.465" end="00:05:34.868">AND GUY GOES YEAH, AND HE GOES WHY DID YOU FILE THE SIGHT DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.868" end="00:05:36.236">&gt;&gt; AND THE GUY GOES OH, YEAH,</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.236" end="00:05:40.741">RIGHT, THAT&apos;S SO THAT AFTER I SHOOT THE GRIZZLY BEAR IT DOESN&apos;T HURT SO MUCH WHEN HE </p>
<p begin="00:05:40.741" end="00:05:43.844">SHOVES THE GUN UP MY ASS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.844" end="00:05:47.214">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:47.214" end="00:05:50.083">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.083" end="00:05:51.985">FAMILY FRIENDLY ENTERTAINMENT.</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.088" end="00:06:03.197">AND OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT GIVING IT A-- AWAY T THERE IS SOME ZOO RELATED-- THAT GOES ON.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.197" end="00:06:04.464">&gt;&gt; CAMERON CROWE DIRECTED IT.</p>
