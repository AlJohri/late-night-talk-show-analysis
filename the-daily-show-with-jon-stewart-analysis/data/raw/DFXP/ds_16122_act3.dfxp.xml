<p begin="00:00:30.097" end="00:00:32.499">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT AND SETS YOU APART.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.499" end="00:00:33.600">&gt;&gt; OKAY, OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.600" end="00:00:35.602">LET&apos;S TRY IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.602" end="00:00:36.236">&gt;&gt; GREAT SONG.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.236" end="00:00:36.837">&gt;&gt; TOTALLY.</p>

<p begin="00:01:09.970" end="00:01:10.671">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.671" end="00:01:13.073">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DID NOT REALIZE YOU ARE PLAYING THE BEST FRIEND IN A </p>
<p begin="00:01:13.073" end="00:01:18.478">MOVIE, THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS THAT THIS REALLY HAPPENED TO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.478" end="00:01:23.684">&gt;&gt; YEAH, ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS WILL WHO I MET WRITING FOR THE ALI G. SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.684" end="00:01:25.853">HE WAS A PRODUCER, HE, LIKE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.853" end="00:01:26.954">BOOKED THE GUESTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.954" end="00:01:28.088">HE LIED TO JAMES LIPTON ALL DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.088" end="00:01:33.160">(LAUGHTER) WHICH IS STRESSFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.160" end="00:01:33.493">SO....</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.493" end="00:01:34.995">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.995" end="00:01:40.234">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;VE ALL LIED TO JAMES LIPTON ONCE OR TWICE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.234" end="00:01:44.972">HE ALWAYS LOOKED REALLY RUN DOWN, WE ASSUMED FROM THE STRESS OF LYING TO JAMES LIPTON ALL DAY </p>
<p begin="00:01:44.972" end="00:01:51.111">AND WE WOULD MAKE FUN OF HIM A LOT DUE TO HOW RUN DOWN HE LOOKED AND WE ALL DEALT WITH IT </p>
<p begin="00:01:51.111" end="00:01:55.616">BETTER, WE THOUGHT, AND WE WERE OF A TOUGHER CONSTITUTION AND A FEW MONTHS LATER WE FOUND OUT HE </p>
<p begin="00:01:55.616" end="00:02:00.254">HAD A MASSIVE TUMOR IN HIS SPINE WHICH MADE US FEEL LIKE DICKS, A AND...</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.254" end="00:02:05.559">(LAUGHTER) AND ALSO WE FELT TERRIBLE FOR HIM, OBVIOUSLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.559" end="00:02:10.264">AND THEN HE GOT BETTER AND WE REALIZED THAT THERE WAS NO MOVIE THAT REALLY FELT LIKE WHAT WE </p>
<p begin="00:02:10.264" end="00:02:11.331">WENT THROUGH BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.331" end="00:02:15.602">HE DIDN&apos;T LOSE HIS SENSE OF HUMOR AND HE KEPT TRYING TO GET WITH GIRLS AND HE KEPT GOING TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:15.602" end="00:02:17.437">BARS AND HE KEPT WORKING SO,</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.437" end="00:02:23.177">LIKE, HE WAS JUST KIND OF TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WH THE BUCKET LIST AND OTHER MOVIES </p>
<p begin="00:02:23.177" end="00:02:28.849">WHERE THEY DO A BUNCH OF FUN (BLEEP) AND THEN DIE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.849" end="00:02:29.950">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:29.950" end="00:02:32.352">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT FILM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.352" end="00:02:33.620">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A GREAT MOVIE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.620" end="00:02:35.756">NOT TO SAY &quot;THE BUCKET LIST&quot; WAS BAD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.756" end="00:02:38.625">BUT IT WASN&apos;T WHAT WE EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.625" end="00:02:41.461">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID HE TAKE ANY BREAK TO HAVE THE TUMOR IN HIS SPINE REMOVED?</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.461" end="00:02:43.897">WAS THERE ANY SLOWDOWN IN HIS DATING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.897" end="00:02:45.165">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:45.165" end="00:02:46.466">&gt;&gt; NOT REALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.466" end="00:02:50.637">HONESTLY, HE COMPLAINED MORE ABOUT, LIKE, WOMEN AND RELATIONSHIPS WHEN HE HAD CANCER </p>
<p begin="00:02:50.637" end="00:02:52.573">THAN HE DID WHEN HE DIDN&apos;T HAVE CANCER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.573" end="00:02:57.678">HE WOULD BARELY TALK ABOUT THE TUMOR AND HE WOULD TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT NO WITHIN WANTED </p>
<p begin="00:02:57.678" end="00:03:01.181">TO, YOU KNOW, SEAL THE DEAL WITH HIM AT TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.181" end="00:03:02.916">AS MOST YOUNG MEN COMPLAIN ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.916" end="00:03:08.889">DOCTORS SAY THEY DID AND I&apos;M SURE IT GARNERED HIM ATTENTION FAVORABLY AS WE DEMONSTRATE IN </p>
<p begin="00:03:08.889" end="00:03:09.389">THE FILM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.389" end="00:03:11.758">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DID THIS... SO WILL WROTE THIS FILM?</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.758" end="00:03:12.226">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.226" end="00:03:15.596">&gt;&gt; Jon: WAS IT HARD FOR YOU GUYS TO WORK OUT WHAT... WHERE THERE </p>
<p begin="00:03:15.596" end="00:03:21.668">THINGS SORT OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU MAYBE BASED ON YOU RIDICULING HIS </p>
<p begin="00:03:21.668" end="00:03:24.605">LOOKING TIRED EARLY ON?</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.605" end="00:03:28.275">THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT TOGETHER AS THE SCRIPT WAS BEING PUT TOGETHER?</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.275" end="00:03:32.779">&gt;&gt; IT DEFINITELY FORCED US TO HAVE AWKWARD CONVERSATIONS THAT WE TRIED TO AVOID FOR YEARS AND </p>
<p begin="00:03:32.779" end="00:03:40.153">YEARS AND YEARS ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECTED OF ONE ANOTHER AND HOW WE KIND OF LET EACH OTHER DOWN </p>
<p begin="00:03:40.153" end="00:03:50.697">AT TIMES AND HOW WE BELIEVE MAYBE INSENSITIVE AND INARTICULATE AND LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.697" end="00:03:53.333">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.333" end="00:03:54.968">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;D KEEP SAYING THAT!</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.968" end="00:03:58.338">SO WE TRIED TO PUT AS MUCH OF THAT IN THE MOVIE AS POSSIBLE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.338" end="00:03:58.705">HONESTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.705" end="00:04:02.042">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND NOW IS WILL FOR INTENTS AND PURPOSES...</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.042" end="00:04:03.710">&gt;&gt; THE HEALTHIEST PERSON I KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.710" end="00:04:05.679">MUCH HEALTHIER THAN ME, I&apos;LL TELL YOU THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.679" end="00:04:07.347">A THOUSAND TIMES OVER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.347" end="00:04:11.785">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW HE RIDICULES YOU FOR NOT LOOKING HEALTHY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.785" end="00:04:15.122">&gt;&gt; HE&apos;S LIKE &quot;DIDN&apos;T YOU LEARN ANYTHING FROM WHAT I WENT THROUGH?</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.122" end="00:04:16.323">&quot; AS I&apos;M SMOKING A HAMBURGER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.323" end="00:04:19.193">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:04:19.193" end="00:04:20.294">&gt;&gt; Jon: NICE!</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.294" end="00:04:24.798">I THINK THAT&apos;S NICE!</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.798" end="00:04:26.233">&gt;&gt; Jon: JUST FOR THE RECORD,</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.233" end="00:04:27.367">SMART AND FUNNY KID.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.367" end="00:04:31.872">WE TRIED TO HIRE HIM LIKE FOUR TIMES ON THIS SHOW AND EVERY TIME HE KEPT BLOWING US OFF AND </p>
<p begin="00:04:31.872" end="00:04:36.543">ONE TIME HE DID SAY &quot;I CAN&apos;T, I HAVE CANCER.&quot; AND WE WERE LIKE, LOOK, IF YOU </p>
<p begin="00:04:36.543" end="00:04:38.478">DON&apos;T WANT TO WORK HERE, JUST (BLEEP)ING SAY IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.478" end="00:04:42.115">(LAUGHTER) BUT LATER WE FOUND OUT THAT THAT WAS THE CASE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.115" end="00:04:44.852">&gt;&gt; IT WORKS FOR EVERYTHING, THAT EXCUSE, THOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.852" end="00:04:45.819">IT IS A GOOD EXCUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.819" end="00:04:46.453">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:04:46.453" end="00:04:50.958">&gt;&gt; Jon: SPEAKING OF EXCUSES, SO I&apos;M TAKING SOME QUESTIONS EARLY ON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.958" end="00:04:54.294">A LADY SAYS TO ME WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR ROSH HASHANAH, EARLIER ON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.294" end="00:04:58.732">(LAUGHTER) AND I TOLD HER NOTHING AND SHE REALLY DID SEEM DISAPPOINTED IN ME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.732" end="00:05:00.601">THIS MOVIE OPENS ON ROSH HASHANAH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.601" end="00:05:04.471">ARE OTHER PEOPLE&apos;S JEWISH MOTHERS GIVING YOU A PROBLEM FOR THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.471" end="00:05:10.377">(LAUGHTER) ARE YOU BUMMED OUT AT HIM FOR THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.377" end="00:05:13.747">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:13.747" end="00:05:16.149">&gt;&gt; I JUST FELT A WAVE OF GUILT FLOOD OVER ME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.149" end="00:05:18.185">IT&apos;S IN THE EITHER NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.185" end="00:05:21.822">YEAH, PROBABLY... I&apos;M NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR ROSH HASHANAH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.822" end="00:05:25.058">&gt;&gt; Jon: I FELT LIKE SHE WAS A REPRESENTATIVE OF SOME, LIKE,</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.058" end="00:05:26.960">WEIRD METAHA DOCTOR-ASSISTED SUICIDE A CLUB.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:29.396">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY!</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.396" end="00:05:31.632">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S LIKE THAT FOOD RATING SYSTEM FOR JEWISH PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.632" end="00:05:33.133">WE JUST WEAR LETTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.133" end="00:05:37.804">&gt;&gt; SHE DID THE THING I SAID &quot;I&apos;M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:37.804" end="00:05:41.208">AND SHE DID ONE OF THESE, &quot;HMM.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:41.208" end="00:05:43.310">&gt;&gt; &quot;HMM.&quot; (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:05:43.310" end="00:05:46.079">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.079" end="00:05:48.182">&gt;&gt; HOW WOULD YOUR ANCESTORS FEEL?</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.182" end="00:05:49.349">THE ONES WHO WERE SLAVES?</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.803" end="00:06:11.738">LAID OUT ON THE SCREEN, IT&apos;S JUST TREMENDOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.738" end="00:06:14.441">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M GLAD IT WENT WELL BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HUMILIATING </p>
<p begin="00:06:14.441" end="00:06:16.476">IF WE DID A CANCER COMEDY THAT REALLY SUCKED.</p>
