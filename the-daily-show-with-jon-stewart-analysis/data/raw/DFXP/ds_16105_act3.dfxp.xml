<p begin="00:00:06.139" end="00:00:16.617">MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE PROFESSOR OF LAW AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS THE CENTER </p>
<p begin="00:00:16.617" end="00:00:18.519">OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.519" end="00:00:21.955">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JOHN COFFEE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.955" end="00:00:27.227">HAVE A SEAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.227" end="00:00:27.628">[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.628" end="00:00:28.328">THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.328" end="00:00:29.129">&gt;&gt; MY PLEASURE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.129" end="00:00:34.134">&gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE HEAD OF THE CENTER FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.134" end="00:00:37.771">I DON&apos;T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE FREE MARKET LIKE THAT, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.771" end="00:00:41.475">THAT DOESN&apos;T SEEM... IT&apos;S A SOCIALIST OPERATION YOU&apos;RE RUNNING OVER THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.475" end="00:00:42.609">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S BEEN SAID.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.609" end="00:00:44.211">&gt;&gt; Jon: HAS IT REALLY BEEN SAID IN </p>
<p begin="00:00:44.211" end="00:00:45.112">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.112" end="00:00:46.346">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.346" end="00:00:51.051">THE RATINGS AGENCY STANDARD &amp; POOR&apos;S, THEY COME OUT ON FRIDAY </p>
<p begin="00:00:51.051" end="00:00:53.720">AND THEY SAY THEY&apos;RE GOING TO DOWNGRADE US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.720" end="00:00:55.355">IS THAT THE SITUATION?</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.355" end="00:01:00.093">OR THEY CAME OUT... WHEN DID THEY COME OUT AND SAY THEY&apos;RE GOING TO DOWNGRADE US.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.093" end="00:01:02.896">&gt;&gt; IT CAME OUT AFTER SOME NEGOTIATION WITH THE TREASURY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.896" end="00:01:07.334">SO EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON KNEW IT WAS COMING, AND THEY STAYED WITH THEIR POSITION, AND IT CAME </p>
<p begin="00:01:07.334" end="00:01:10.938">OUT FRIDAY AND THEN THE MARKET RESPONDED ON MONDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.938" end="00:01:12.105">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS STANDARD &amp; POOR&apos;S,</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.105" end="00:01:17.144">THEY HAD A VERY POOR TRACK RECORD IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL MELTDOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.144" end="00:01:22.616">THEY HAD BEEN GRANTING TRIPLE-A STATUS TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CORPORATE BONDS, YES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.616" end="00:01:29.723">&gt;&gt; ALL OF THEM, STANDARD &amp; POOR&apos;S, MOODY&apos;S, THE BIG THREE </p>
<p begin="00:01:29.723" end="00:01:33.660">SYSTEMATICALLY INFLATED THEIR RATINGS AND PROBABLY WERE THE GROUP MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:33.660" end="00:01:34.628">FINANCIAL COLLAPSE IN 2008.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.628" end="00:01:36.230">IT WOULDN&apos;T HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.230" end="00:01:38.932">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, THAT&apos;S EXCITING TO HEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.932" end="00:01:39.333">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.333" end="00:01:41.802">NOW, SO THEY HAD BEEN LET&apos;S SAY AN EASY GRADER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.802" end="00:01:42.803">YOU&apos;RE A PROFESSOR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.803" end="00:01:44.905">LET&apos;S SAY YOU&apos;RE KNOWN AS AN EASY PROFESSOR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.905" end="00:01:48.008">YOU TAKE MY CLASS, YOU GET AN A.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.008" end="00:01:49.843">SO I SIGN UP FOR YOUR CLASS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.843" end="00:01:54.248">AND I COME IN AND YOU GO, D.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.248" end="00:02:02.656">DOESN&apos;T THAT MEAN THAT I AM EVEN WORSE THAN A.I.G. AND THESE OTHER DERIVATIVE PLACES THAT GOT </p>
<p begin="00:02:02.656" end="00:02:04.558">THE TRIPLE-As?</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.558" end="00:02:06.660">&gt;&gt; YOU NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.660" end="00:02:11.365">STANDARD &amp; POOR&apos;S WAS PAID BY THE PEOPLE THEY WERE RATING IN ALL OF THOSE OTHER CASES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.365" end="00:02:18.705">BUT WHEN WE TURN TO A COUNTRY OR SOVEREIGN DEBT, THEY ARE NOT PAID FOR THE RATING, AND NOW </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.705" end="00:02:20.307">THEY BECOME STRANGELY ENOUGH INDEPENDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.307" end="00:02:23.810">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET ME SAY THIS: I THINK I CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.810" end="00:02:24.178">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.178" end="00:02:24.511">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.511" end="00:02:28.515">&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME WITH WHERE WE&apos;RE GOING HERE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.515" end="00:02:30.784">HOW MUCH DO THEY WANT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.784" end="00:02:32.319">LET&apos;S PAY THEM AND WE&apos;RE DONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:34.721">WE&apos;LL BE DONE WITH THE WHOLE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.721" end="00:02:35.122">[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.122" end="00:02:37.591">&gt;&gt; A COUPLE YEARS AGO, THAT DID HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.591" end="00:02:43.230">THAT&apos;S HOW ALL THOSE TRIPLE-As CAME FROM, SOMETIMES THE FEE PAID THE RATING AGENCY, MIGHT BE </p>
<p begin="00:02:43.230" end="00:02:47.467">$5 MILLION OR MORE, AND WAS ALWAYS BASED ON WHAT RATING YOU GAVE THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.467" end="00:02:50.003">IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS IN VERY SIMPLE TERMS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.003" end="00:02:50.571">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.571" end="00:02:54.942">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S LIKE A BASEBALL LEAGUE IN WHICH THE HOME TEAM HIRES THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:54.942" end="00:02:59.546">UMPIRE, PAYS THE UMPIRE AFTER EACH INNING, TELLS THE UMPIRE THE FEE WILL BE BASED ON THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:59.546" end="00:03:03.684">QUALITY OF HIS PERFORMANCE AND IF THEY DON&apos;T LIKE HIS PERFORMANCE HE&apos;LL NEVER UMPIRE </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.684" end="00:03:04.952">IN THEIR STADIUM AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.952" end="00:03:08.956">THAT&apos;S THE FUNCTIONAL ANALOGY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.956" end="00:03:12.059">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW, AGAIN, I HAPPEN TO FOLLOW BASEBALL...</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.059" end="00:03:14.595">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.595" end="00:03:15.295">THAT&apos;S INSANE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.295" end="00:03:16.697">THAT&apos;S AN INSANE SYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.697" end="00:03:22.135">NOW, WE DID HAVE IN THE DODD-FRANK BILL A CENTER THAT WAS GOING TO OPEN UP, AN OFFICE </p>
<p begin="00:03:22.135" end="00:03:28.175">THAT WAS GOING TO THROUGH GOVERNANCE REGULATE THESE RATINGS AGENCIES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.175" end="00:03:30.077">IT WAS WRITTEN INTO THE DODD-FRANK BILL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.077" end="00:03:30.844">HOW IS THAT GOING?</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.844" end="00:03:32.546">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S NOT BEEN FUNDED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.546" end="00:03:34.681">THE SEC CAN&apos;T SET IT UP WITHOUT THE FUNDS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.681" end="00:03:40.320">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO WE SET THIS THING UP A YEAR AGO TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM RATINGS AGE SIX,</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.320" end="00:03:43.323">BUT WE HAVEN&apos;T OPENED THE OFFICE YET BECAUSE WE HAVE NO MONEY FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.323" end="00:03:44.892">&gt;&gt; YOU GOT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.892" end="00:03:47.661">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.661" end="00:03:59.540">&gt;&gt; Jon: AS A PROFESSOR, AS MAN OF KNOWLEDGE, DO YOU EVER WANT TO IN THREE STOOGES PARLANCE </p>
<p begin="00:03:59.540" end="00:04:03.477">GO -- </p>
<p begin="00:04:05.212" end="00:04:05.579">[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.579" end="00:04:11.952">I HONESTLY FOR THE LIFE OF ME DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN OURSELVES INTO THIS </p>
<p begin="00:04:11.952" end="00:04:14.621">POSITION IN ANY RATIONAL WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.621" end="00:04:19.660">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, A GUY IN YOUR PROFESSION HAS HAD THE ONLY LONG CAL ANSWER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.660" end="00:04:26.133">A MAN CALLED AL FRANKEN WHO STARTED OUT IN YOUR FIELD AND PROVED ON TO A HIGHER FORM OF COMEDY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.133" end="00:04:31.138">[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.138" end="00:04:32.973">HE HAS A PROPOSAL THAT WILL REALLY WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.973" end="00:04:38.278">IN THAT DODD-FRANK ACT, THERE IS HIS PROVISION THAT SAYS THE SEC SHOULD STUDY, HE WANTED TO ADOPT </p>
<p begin="00:04:38.278" end="00:04:43.083">IT, BUT IT ONLY WENT THROUGH IS THE SEC SHOULD STUDY WHETHER WE SHOULD SEPARATE THE PAYMENT OF </p>
<p begin="00:04:43.083" end="00:04:46.920">THE RATING AGENCY FROM THE SELECTION OF THE RATING AGENCY,</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.920" end="00:04:51.692">SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE CHOICE TO INVESTORS AND HAVE THE PAYMENT STILL COME FROM THE ISSUER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.692" end="00:04:55.929">THAT COULD WORK, BUT ALL WE&apos;RE GOING TO DO IS STUDY IT FOR ONE MORE YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.929" end="00:04:57.831">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO FIGHTS IT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.831" end="00:04:59.900">DO THE RATINGS AGENCIES FIGHT THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.900" end="00:05:01.635">DO THE CORPORATIONS FIGHT THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.635" end="00:05:06.240">AND WHY CAN&apos;T SOVEREIGN NATIONS GET IN ON THAT GRAVE I HAVE TRAIN?</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:10.744">&gt;&gt; WELL, SOVEREIGN NATIONS DON&apos;T PAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.744" end="00:05:12.846">THEY MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IN NOT PAYING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.846" end="00:05:14.381">IT&apos;S NOT SO MUCH CORPORATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.381" end="00:05:16.083">IT&apos;S BAYICALLY THE INVESTMENT BANKS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.083" end="00:05:20.053">WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST DECADE IS ALL OF THESE ASSET BACKED SECURITIZATIONS THAT </p>
<p begin="00:05:20.053" end="00:05:21.288">YOU&apos;VE SOME WHEAT HEARD ABOUT,</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.288" end="00:05:25.259">THEY&apos;RE ALL ISSUED BY MAYBE SEVEN TO EIGHT INVESTMENT BANKS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.259" end="00:05:28.762">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THESE ARE THE C.E.O.S THAT TOOK ALL THESE MORTGAGE SECURITIES AND SPREAD </p>
<p begin="00:05:28.762" end="00:05:30.130">THEM OUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD?</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.130" end="00:05:31.965">&gt;&gt; FLOODED THE WORLD WITH THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.965" end="00:05:36.170">AS THE QUALITY WENT DOWN, THE RATINGS WENT UP, BUT ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT INVESTMENT BANKS DID </p>
<p begin="00:05:36.170" end="00:05:39.373">THAT, AND THEY HAD REAL MARKET POWER OVER THE RATING AGENCY,</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.373" end="00:05:45.078">WHEREAS INDIVIDUAL CORPORATIONS GO TO THE MARKET ONCE EVERY TEN YEARS, DON&apos;T HAVE THE SAME CLOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.078" end="00:05:51.084">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW, WHY THEN DID INVESTORS FREAK OUT WHEN STANDARD &amp; POOR&apos;S DOWNGRADED OUR DEBT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.084" end="00:05:53.854">THE MONEY HAS BEEN FLOWING OUT OF THE STOP EVER SINCE THAT HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.854" end="00:05:58.091">HERE&apos;S THE PART THAT FREAKS ME OUT THE MOST: THE INVESTORS OF THESE LARGE BANKS AND EVERYTHING </p>
<p begin="00:05:58.091" end="00:06:07.067">ARE POURING THEIR MONEY INTO U.S. TREASURIES, THE VERY THING THAT HAS JUST BEEN COULDN&apos;T -- </p>
<p begin="00:06:07.067" end="00:06:08.468">DOWN GRADED AS MORE OF A RISK.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.468" end="00:06:09.603">HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.603" end="00:06:13.040">&gt;&gt; WELL, FIRST OF ALL, STANDARD &amp; POOR&apos;S DOWNGRADE WAS PROBABLY </p>
<p begin="00:06:13.040" end="00:06:17.144">THE SPARK THAT SET OFF THE POWDER KEG THAT&apos;S BEEN SITTING THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.144" end="00:06:22.082">THE POWDER KEG IS THE PARALYSIS IN CONGRESS, WHICH I&apos;M SURE YOU&apos;VE DEALT WITH BEFORE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.082" end="00:06:23.317">&gt;&gt; Jon: FAMILIAR WITH IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.317" end="00:06:25.719">&gt;&gt; AND THE MESS IN EUROPE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.719" end="00:06:28.689">STANDARD &amp; POOR&apos;S DID THE SAME THING WITH GREECE, ITALY, SPAIN,</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.689" end="00:06:32.593">PORTUGAL, AND THE EXPERIENCE THERE WAS THAT DOWNGRADING CREATED SOMETHING OF A PANIC.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.593" end="00:06:38.065">SO THERE WAS A PANIC, BUT WHEN INVESTORS HAD THE CHOOSE, STILL THE SAFEST THING AROUND WAS </p>
<p begin="00:06:38.065" end="00:06:39.433">EITHER U.S. TREASURIES OR GOLD,</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.433" end="00:06:41.335">SO MUCH OF IT WENT INTO U.S.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.335" end="00:06:41.735">TREASURIES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.735" end="00:06:47.140">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT JUST FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT GOT US INTO THIS MESS, THAT DESTROYED </p>
<p begin="00:06:47.140" end="00:06:51.712">THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR ECONOMY AS IT&apos;S CRUMBLING DOWN CAME TO US WITH THE BAGS OF </p>
<p begin="00:06:51.712" end="00:06:56.483">MONEY THEY WERE ABLE TO GET OUT AND GO, CAN YOU HOLD THIS FOR ME UNTIL THIS ALL GETS FIXED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.483" end="00:06:57.718">&gt;&gt; YES, GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.718" end="00:07:01.855">I LIKE THAT ANALOGY.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.855" end="00:07:02.222">[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.222" end="00:07:04.157">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE SUPPOSED TO SAY NO.</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.157" end="00:07:06.693">THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING US THE OVERVIEW.</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.693" end="00:07:07.661">WE APPRECIATE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.661" end="00:07:08.795">PROFESSOR JOHN COFFEE.</p>
