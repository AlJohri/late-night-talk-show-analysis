<p begin="00:02:12.332" end="00:02:21.875">AND THEN I ATE A PORK CHOP THAT COST THE SAME AS ELECTION, IT WAS A LITTLE DRY, BUT WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.875" end="00:02:25.979">SO WHILE THE PRESIDENT JETS AROUND WITH HIS CASH VACUUM OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE </p>
<p begin="00:02:25.979" end="00:02:28.081">THEY&apos;RE STILL DUKING IT OUT AMONGST THEMSELVES.</p>

<p begin="00:02:33.153" end="00:02:34.188">HE GREW UP THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.188" end="00:02:35.556">HIS FATHER WAS GOVERNOR THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.556" end="00:02:40.661">FOR GOD&apos;S SAKES, HE&apos;S NAMED FOR THE SHAPE OF MICHIGAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.661" end="00:02:41.662">THE MITT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.662" end="00:02:49.636">(LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, MUCH LUCKIER THAN HIS FLORIDA-BORN BROTHER WILLARD [BLEEP]</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.636" end="00:02:53.440">ROMNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.440" end="00:03:00.380">OBVIOUSLY A [BLEEP] FAMILY NICKNAME.</p>

<p begin="00:03:11.758" end="00:03:12.292">JOKE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.292" end="00:03:15.062">OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE PROBLEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.062" end="00:03:17.397">ROMNEY MAY FACE IN MICHIGAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.397" end="00:03:23.904">&gt;&gt; IN 2008 ROMNEY WROTE IN &quot;THE NEW YORK TIMES&quot; LET DETROIT GO BANKRUPT.</p>

<p begin="00:03:25.973" end="00:03:30.244">DETROIT CAN [BLEEP].</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.244" end="00:03:35.983">LUCKILY, I REALLY HOPE THE TV IN THE GREEN ROOM IS OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.983" end="00:03:40.254">LUCKILY MITT ROMNEY HAS UNLEASHED A BRILLIANT NEW AD CAMPAIGN TO MAKE MICHIGAN </p>
<p begin="00:03:40.254" end="00:03:42.089">VOTERS FORGET THAT ENTIRE ARTICLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.089" end="00:03:43.323">&gt;&gt; I GREW UP IN MICHIGAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.323" end="00:03:45.092">IT WAS EXCITING TO BE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.092" end="00:03:47.728">I REMEMBER GOING TO THE DETROIT AUTO SHOW WITH MY DAD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.728" end="00:03:48.729">THAT WAS A BIG DEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.729" end="00:03:50.764">PEOPLE HERE IN DETROIT ARE DISTRESSED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.764" end="00:03:53.166">I WANT TO MAKE MICHIGAN STRONGER AND BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.166" end="00:03:55.602">MICHIGAN&apos;S BEEN MY HOME AND THIS IS PERSONAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.602" end="00:04:01.909">&gt;&gt; Jon: WOW, WHAT A-- POWERFUL AND EMOTIONAL WAY TO CONNECT TO YOUR HOME TOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.909" end="00:04:07.848">I-- OF COURSE LIKE ALL THINGS ROMNEY THERE ARE SOME CAVIARS, I&apos;M SORRY, CAVEATS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.848" end="00:04:12.319">AS IT TURNS OUT, THAT PHOTO IN THE AD OF ROMNEY AND HIS DAD AT THE DETROIT AUTO SHOW </p>
<p begin="00:04:12.319" end="00:04:17.457">IS ACTUALLY HIM AND HIS DAD AT THE 1964 NEW YORK WORLD FAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.457" end="00:04:22.229">WHICH APPARENTLY IN ROMNEY&apos;S MIND TOOK PLACE IN QUEENS&apos;S MICHIGAN, AND THE AMERICAN </p>
<p begin="00:04:22.229" end="00:04:26.667">CAR HE IS DRIVING AROUND IS A CHRYSLER 300 WHICH IS MANUFACTURED IN CANADA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.667" end="00:04:30.470">SO AND YOU WON&apos;T BE SURPRISED HE WASN&apos;T ACTUALLY DRIVING, HE WAS IN FACT </p>
<p begin="00:04:30.470" end="00:04:31.438">HIMSELF BEING DRIVEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.438" end="00:04:39.980">ALL RIGHT, SO--  (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS ISN&apos;T JUST ABOUT ROMNEY&apos;S WEAKNESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.980" end="00:04:43.083">IT&apos;S ALSO ABOUT HIS OPPONENT RICK SANTORUM&apos;S STRENGTH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.083" end="00:04:44.751">HE&apos;S A SERIOUS CONTENDER NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.751" end="00:04:49.256">AND AS WE OURSELVES RECOGNIZE TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN I ANNOUNCED ON THIS PROGRAM WE WOULD NO LONGER </p>
<p begin="00:04:49.256" end="00:04:56.763">BE MAKING JOKES ABOUT THE ALTERNATE MEANING OF SANTORUM&apos;S NAME, YEAH, NO </p>
<p begin="00:04:56.763" end="00:05:00.167">MATTER HOW TEMPTING IT MAY BE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.167" end="00:05:04.238">&gt;&gt; RICK SANTORUM&apos;S SURGE IS SPREADING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.238" end="00:05:15.849">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:15.849" end="00:05:25.292">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS MUST COVER SANTORUM AS A SERIOUS CANDIDATE, NOT AS A NAME SAKE FOR STAINING ANAL LIQUIDES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.292" end="00:05:30.430">OKAY, PERHAPS WE CAN DISTRACT OURSELVES WITH SANTORUM&apos;S LATEST ANTI-ROMNEY CAMPAIGN AD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.430" end="00:05:33.667">&gt;&gt; THIS TIME ROMNEY&apos;S FIRING HIS MARK AT RICK SANTORUM,</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.667" end="00:05:38.071">AND A STAGGERING $20 MILLION SUPPOSEDLY ATTACK SEVERAL REPUBLICANS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.071" end="00:05:45.712">AND IN THE END, MITT ROMNEY&apos;S UGLY ATTACKS ARE GOING TO BACKFIRE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.712" end="00:05:54.388">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:54.388" end="00:06:00.060">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO MITT ROMNEY ATTACKS SANTORUM AND ENDS UP WITH BROWN LIQUID ON HIS SHIRT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.060" end="00:06:01.695">THIS IS ENTRAPMENT!</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.695" end="00:06:03.397">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.397" end="00:06:07.534">ACTUALLY THE WHOLE SECOND MEANING OF SANTORUM THING WAS STARTED AS A PROTEST OF </p>
<p begin="00:06:07.534" end="00:06:09.503">THE SENATOR&apos;S VIEWS ON GAY MARRIAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.503" end="00:06:14.341">BUT LATELY, ACTIVISTS HAVE TAKEN AN EVEN MORE SUBTLE APPROACH TO THAT ISSUE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.341" end="00:06:19.780">&gt;&gt; RICK SANTORUM&apos;S TRIP TO WASHINGTON STATE LAST NIGHT WASN&apos;T ALL SMOOTH SAILING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.780" end="00:06:21.815">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S CALLED GLITTER BOMBING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.815" end="00:06:28.322">&gt;&gt; PROTESTORS CRASHED THE EVENT AND HE FELL VICTIM TO ANOTHER GLITTER BOMB.</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.322" end="00:06:34.595">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO WORD WHETHER THIS WAS DETONATED REMOTELY OR THE WORK OF A SUICIDE GLITTER BOMBER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.595" end="00:06:41.502">(LAUGHTER) THE GLITTER BOMB HAS EMERGED AS A WEAPON OF CHOICE FOR GAY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS LOOKING </p>
<p begin="00:06:41.502" end="00:06:46.073">FOR A FORM OF PROTEST THAT&apos;S MORE CLEVER THAN A PIE IN THE FACE, BUT LESS CLEVER </p>
<p begin="00:06:46.073" end="00:06:47.741">THAN SOMETHING ACTUALLY CLEVER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.741" end="00:06:52.880">(LAUGHTER) YEAH, YOU DIDN&apos;T SEE THAT ONE COMING, DID YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.880" end="00:06:55.449">ALMOST ALL THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN HIT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.449" end="00:07:01.722">INCLUDING MITT ROMNEY, NEWT GINGRICH AND MICHELEBACK MANN, BLIRT-- GLITTER </p>
<p begin="00:07:01.722" end="00:07:08.328">BOMBING IS SUCH A CONCERN THE SECRET SERVICE USED SPECIALLY TRAINED GLITTER BOMB SNIFFING DOGS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.328" end="00:07:13.066">(LAUGHTER) IF NOTHING ELSE THESE INCIDENTS GIVE VOTERS A CHANCE TO SEE HOW CANDIDATES </p>
<p begin="00:07:13.066" end="00:07:14.067">HANDLE THEMSELVES UNDER FIRE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.067" end="00:07:16.136">MAY FAVORITE RESPONSE HAS TO BE MITT ROMNEY&apos;S.</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.136" end="00:07:18.772">&gt;&gt; OH, I&apos;VE GOT GLITTER IN MY HAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.772" end="00:07:21.775">THAT&apos;S NOT ALL THAT IS IN MY HAIR, I&apos;LL TELL YOU THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.775" end="00:07:28.715">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:07:28.715" end="00:07:31.451">&gt;&gt; Jon: SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE,</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.451" end="00:07:33.420">ANYBODY SEEN SOMETHING ABOUT MARY?</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.420" end="00:07:36.190">SERIOUSLY, THERE&apos;S ALL KINDS OF STUFF IN MY HAIR.</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.190" end="00:07:36.957">ANYWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.957" end="00:07:41.662">STILL, I DO HAVE TO HAND IT TO THE GAY ACTIVISTS WHO CARRY OUT THESE GLITTER BOMBINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.662" end="00:07:43.764">REALLY TERRIFIC WAY TO WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR SIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.764" end="00:07:45.499">IT&apos;S A CLEAR UNEQUIVOCAL STATEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.499" end="00:07:47.568">WE ARE DESERVING OF DIGNITY,</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.568" end="00:07:49.236">RESPECT, AND EQUAL RIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.236" end="00:07:53.907">AND UNTIL WE GET IT, WE WILL ACT LIKE PET LENT CHILDREN.</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.907" end="00:07:54.474">-- PETULANT CHILDREN.</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.474" end="00:07:55.209">WE&apos;LL BE RIGHT </p>
