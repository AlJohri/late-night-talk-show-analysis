<p begin="00:00:36.436" end="00:00:39.473">I ASSUME IF I OPEN IT UP, IT WILL JUST START SHOUTING AT ME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.473" end="00:00:42.709">&gt;&gt; NO, WHAT IT WILL DO IS SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS AT ONCE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.709" end="00:00:47.414">I MEAN, WHAT WE&apos;RE GOING TO DO-- YOU JUST READ THIS BOOK AND AMERICA GETS BACK TO WHERE IT </p>

<p begin="00:00:47.915" end="00:00:48.916">THAT&apos;S THE WHOLE POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.916" end="00:00:55.889">&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU WRITE IN THERE THAT THIS IS THE WORST ANYBODY HAS EVER SEEN IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.889" end="00:01:00.894">PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON SINCE WATERGATE, THE INTERNET, AND BLOGS HAVE </p>
<p begin="00:01:00.894" end="00:01:06.533">HARDENED PEOPLE&apos;S OPINIONS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY&apos;RE JUST TRYING TO DEFEND THEIR OWN </p>
<p begin="00:01:06.533" end="00:01:07.234">IDEOLOGICAL TURF.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.234" end="00:01:10.304">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S MORE POLARIZATION THAN ANY TIME I HAVE SEEN IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.304" end="00:01:15.142">I CHECKED WITH FRIENDS IN WASHINGTON AND MANY FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT OUR INSTITUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.142" end="00:01:19.379">I HAD TWO BRIGHT MEN COME UP INTO ME IN WASHINGTON AND SAID,&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:01:19.379" end="00:01:25.085">MR. BROKE AUGUST, I&apos;D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE OLD DAYS.&quot; I THINK THEY MEANT 1998.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.085" end="00:01:26.553">HE SAID, &quot;I&apos;M A DEMOCRAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.553" end="00:01:27.321">HE&apos;S A REPUBLICAN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.321" end="00:01:28.388">HE&apos;S MY BEST FRIEND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.388" end="00:01:30.991">WE ARGUE POLITICS ALL NIGHT LONG.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.991" end="00:01:33.227">THEY BOTH WORK FOR CONGRESSMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.227" end="00:01:38.098">HE SAID MY BOSS WON&apos;T TALK TO HIS BOSS, AND HIS BOSS WON&apos;T TALK TO MY BOSS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.098" end="00:01:42.102">AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY WOULD GENERALLY FIND A WAY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WAS IN </p>
<p begin="00:01:42.102" end="00:01:45.172">THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY, EVEN IN THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.172" end="00:01:47.441">&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHEN YOU&apos;RE OUT IN THE COUNTRY, DO YOU GET A SENSE </p>
<p begin="00:01:47.441" end="00:01:53.647">THAT PEOPLE ARE AS POLARIZED OR THAT WASHINGTON HAS BECOME LIKE THE RESIN OF DISAGREEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.647" end="00:01:57.718">THEY&apos;VE JUST BECOME THIS PURE FORM OF POLARIZATION THAT DOESN&apos;T NECESSARILY EXIST?</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.718" end="00:02:02.789">&gt;&gt; NO, WHAT I FIND WHEN I GO OUT IN THE COUNTRY THEY FEEL WASHINGTON IS WALLED OFF FROM THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.789" end="00:02:09.663">SO IF YOU GO TO A MID-SIZED CITY IN MID-AMERICA, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU FIND A REPUBLICAN BANKER WORKING </p>
<p begin="00:02:09.663" end="00:02:13.767">WITH THE DEMOCRAT WHO IS A BACKHOE OPERATOR OR CONTRACTOR OF SOME KIND BECAUSE THEY HAVE </p>
<p begin="00:02:13.767" end="00:02:17.137">TO GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES AND THEY HAVE TO PRESERVE THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR BUSINESS AND </p>
<p begin="00:02:17.137" end="00:02:17.971">THEIR COMMUNITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.971" end="00:02:20.240">THEY&apos;VE PRETTY MUCH GIVEN UP ON THE IDEA THAT THEY&apos;RE GOING TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:20.240" end="00:02:22.442">GET MUCH HELP FROM WASHINGTON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.442" end="00:02:28.315">77% OF THE COUNTRY IN ALMOST ALL THE POLLS SAY WE WANT THESE PARTIES TO WORK TOGETHER AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.315" end="00:02:35.255">BUT AS YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO FAR CORNERS OF THE ROOM AND THEY DON&apos;T WANT TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:35.255" end="00:02:36.623">COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.623" end="00:02:38.692">&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU MADE AN INTERESTING POINT IN THE BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.692" end="00:02:41.828">YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CONNECTION AMERICANS HAVE WITH THE COUNTRY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.828" end="00:02:43.096">THIS IDEA OF SERVICE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.096" end="00:02:47.768">YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY SEEM MORE CHARITY-MINDED THAN THEY WERE WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.768" end="00:02:48.869">BUT I WAS HIGH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.869" end="00:02:50.938">SO I DON&apos;T KNOW.</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.538" end="00:02:58.612">I-- I-- I COULD HAVE-- I COULD HAVE MISSED A LOT OF-- A LOT OF EVENTS THAT WERE MORE SUPPORT BASED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.612" end="00:03:00.848">&gt;&gt; I&apos;VE BEEN TO YOUR ALMA MATER,</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.848" end="00:03:02.382">AND I&apos;VE GOT THE RECORDS, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.382" end="00:03:03.584">YOU DON&apos;T WANT TO GO THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.584" end="00:03:05.419">&gt;&gt; Jon:  NO, I DON&apos;T WANT TO GO THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.419" end="00:03:07.054">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M HANGING ON TO THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.054" end="00:03:08.522">&gt;&gt; Jon:  I UNDERSTAND THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.522" end="00:03:08.956">&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.956" end="00:03:14.061">&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU GET THE SENSE THERE IS SORT OF THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE VERY MUCH LOOKING FOR A </p>
<p begin="00:03:14.061" end="00:03:18.432">DIRECTION TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN BUT ARE FINDING THEIR OWN WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.432" end="00:03:21.235">THERE ISN&apos;T ANY KIND OF TOP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.235" end="00:03:21.735">DOWN LEADERSHIP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.735" end="00:03:25.405">&gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WHY DON&apos;T WE HAVE MANDATORY PUBLIC SERVICE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.405" end="00:03:27.074">WE&apos;RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.074" end="00:03:31.645">WHAT I SUGGEST IN THE BOOK IS WE COULD HAVE PUBLIC SERVICE ACADEMIES, KIND OF ON THE MODEL </p>
<p begin="00:03:31.645" end="00:03:34.281">OF THE MILITARY ACADEMIES,</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.281" end="00:03:39.319">PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS, THE JOHN DERERKS FELLOW IN AGRICULTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.319" end="00:03:41.488">THE JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON FELLOW IN MEDICINE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.488" end="00:03:44.258">THEY WORK IN THIS COUNTRY, THEY WORK ABROAD FOR THREE YEARS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.258" end="00:03:49.897">THEY COME BACK, GET THREE YEARS TO PROVE THEMSELVES IN THE COMPANIES, WE HAVE A NEW </p>
<p begin="00:03:49.897" end="00:03:55.502">WORKFORCE WITH A NEW SKILL SET AND WE NEED BIG, BOLD IDEAS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVERYBODY </p>
<p begin="00:03:55.502" end="00:03:56.837">COULD GET EXCITED ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.837" end="00:04:01.041">&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHY COULDN&apos;T WE HAVE SOME TYPE OF ENLISTMENT PROGRAM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.041" end="00:04:03.277">AND I&apos;M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE MILITARY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.277" end="00:04:04.077">YOU MAKE THE POINT IN THE BOOK,</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.077" end="00:04:10.484">THE MILITARY AND THEIR FAMILIES BEAR THIS SACRIFICE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.484" end="00:04:14.888">AND YOU MENTION THE 1% OF THE COUNTRY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.888" end="00:04:17.758">WHAT ABOUT ENLISTMENT SERVICE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.758" end="00:04:22.729">NOT MILITARY-BASED, BUT MAYBE PEOPLE&apos;S CHOICE, GIVING A YEAR </p>
<p begin="00:04:22.729" end="00:04:24.731">OF SERVICE OF SOMEBODY&apos;S TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.731" end="00:04:25.632">WHY CAN&apos;T THAT TAKE PLACE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.632" end="00:04:27.067">&gt;&gt; I&apos;D BE ALL FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.067" end="00:04:31.071">WHAT I&apos;M JUST TRYING TO DO IS KICK-START THE CONVERSATION WITH </p>
<p begin="00:04:31.071" end="00:04:32.439">THE PUBLIC SERVICE ACADEMY IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.439" end="00:04:33.440">LET&apos;S START TALKING ABOUT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:35.676">LET&apos;S SEE IF THERE&apos;S A WAY WE CAN GET TO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.676" end="00:04:40.714">WHEN I FIRST PROPOSED IT TO SOME FRIENDS OF MINE, ONE TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY CONSERVATIVE SOUTH </p>
<p begin="00:04:40.714" end="00:04:45.686">TEXAS BUSINESS MAN AND SAID MAKE IT PUBLIC-PRIVATE, GET THE PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.686" end="00:04:47.487">I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.487" end="00:04:48.622">THAT&apos;S WHY I PUT THAT IN THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.622" end="00:04:53.193">I TALKED TO A LOT OF C.E.O.s AND OTHERS AND THEY SAID IT&apos;S WORTH THINKING ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.193" end="00:04:58.999">THE 1% VERSUS THE 99% IS A CONTINUING ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE 1% OF THE COUNTRY IS </p>
<p begin="00:04:58.999" end="00:05:00.734">DOING 100% OF THE FIGHTING,</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.734" end="00:05:03.036">TAKING 100% OF THE BULLETS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.036" end="00:05:04.571">NOTHING IS ASKED OF THE REST OF US.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.571" end="00:05:08.041">THAT 1% NOW WILL BEGIN TO COME THOAM A BROKEN ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.041" end="00:05:10.410">THEY&apos;VE BEEN FIGHTING THE BAD GUYS FOR 10 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.410" end="00:05:14.047">THEY DON&apos;T HAVE THE TRAINING FOR THIS KIND OF AN ECONOMY AND WE </p>
<p begin="00:05:14.047" end="00:05:16.283">NEED TO NOT JUST SAY,&quot; HEY,</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.283" end="00:05:18.552">WELCOME BACK, BUDDY,&quot; AND WALK AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.552" end="00:05:23.724">WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO REINTDWRAIT THEM INTO SOCIETY AND FIND WORK FOR THEM AND MAKE </p>
<p begin="00:05:23.724" end="00:05:28.395">SURE IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY RETURN TO THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.064" end="00:05:37.738">BUT YOU DO-- YOU HAVE THIS GROUP OF INCREDIBLY TALENTED AND DETERMINED INDIVIDUALS WHO </p>
<p begin="00:05:37.738" end="00:05:40.440">CLEARLY KNOW HOW TO REBUILD COUNTRIES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.440" end="00:05:41.542">WE COULD USE REBUILDING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.542" end="00:05:43.944">IT SEEMS LIKE A NICE MATCH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.944" end="00:05:47.347">&gt;&gt; WELL, THE FACT IS THAT THEY ARE WELL TRAINED AT AN EARLY AGE.</p>
