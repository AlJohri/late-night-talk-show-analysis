<p begin="00:00:55.889" end="00:00:58.792">&gt;&gt; I THINK EVEN A 25-YEAR-OLD MAYBE SHOULDN&apos;T BE ABLE TO BUY THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.792" end="00:01:02.429">I MEAN, IT REALLY IS GROTESQUE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.429" end="00:01:07.401">I GET THAT IT&apos;S FREE SPEECH, TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS TO POLITICAL SPEECH, -- </p>
<p begin="00:01:07.401" end="00:01:08.435">&gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE FUN TO PLAY.</p>

<p begin="00:01:32.993" end="00:01:35.729">&gt;&gt; RIGHT, AND WE HAVE LEFT IRAQ IN BULK AND DID SO AFTER A SUCCESSFUL -- </p>

<p begin="00:01:48.108" end="00:01:51.879">IT BECAME MUCH MORE PEACEFUL AND WE DREW DOWN, 130,000 OF FROM THE SURGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.879" end="00:01:54.348">PRESIDENT OBAMA&apos;S SURGE IN AFGHANISTAN WORKED PRETTY WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.348" end="00:01:56.283">EVERYONE AGREED WE WERE GOING TO DRAW DOWN.</p>

<p begin="00:02:11.932" end="00:02:14.568">FIGHTING THE WAR ON TERROR HAS BEEN WRONG FOR 10 YEARS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.568" end="00:02:23.076">WOULD YOU SAY NOW-- WOULD YOU-- WOULD YOU STAND AND FACE THE CAMERA AND SAY-- AND-- AND-- </p>

<p begin="00:02:39.893" end="00:02:41.161">AND I THINK ON THE WHOLE DOING THE RIGHT THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.161" end="00:02:46.099">LOOK, A WAR-- A WORLD IN WHICH AMERICANS HAVE TO FIGHT AND HAVE TO BE, IN EFFECT, THE KIND OF </p>
<p begin="00:02:46.099" end="00:02:48.001">WORLD POLICEMEN IS A DIFFICULT WORLD FOR US.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.001" end="00:02:53.273">GOD KNOWS WE ALL HATE TO SEE YOUNG AMERICAN MEN AND WOMEN GO OVER THERE AND FIGHT AND GET </p>

<p begin="00:02:53.907" end="00:02:58.779">ON THE OTHER HAND, A WORLD IN WHICH WE DON&apos;T DO THAT IS A MORE DANGEROUS WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.779" end="00:03:01.048">&gt;&gt; Jon: ISN&apos;T THAT A FALSE CHOICE BECAUSE A WORLD WHERE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.048" end="00:03:05.052">YOU KNOW, IN TERRORISM WE PLAY CHAK-A-MOLES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.052" end="00:03:07.054">EIGHT TO 10 PLACES, RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.054" end="00:03:14.361">IF COVERING TWO HOLES ON THE GAME COSTS $10 BILLION A MONTH AND COUNTLESS AMERICAN LIVES,</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.361" end="00:03:21.802">HOW DO WE COVER-- AND DOES IT MAKE US ANY SAFER BECAUSE EVEN STABILIZING IRAQ OR STABILIZING </p>
<p begin="00:03:21.802" end="00:03:23.871">AFGHANISTAN DOESN&apos;T MAKE IT A COUNTRY WHERE TERROR ATTACKS CANNOTTING PLOTTED AGAINST THE </p>

<p begin="00:03:25.739" end="00:03:29.376">IN DEMOCRACIES, TERROR ATTACKS ARE PLOTTED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.376" end="00:03:35.482">SO ISN&apos;T OUR WHOLE STRATEGY, AS YOU AND MY PEOPLE WOULD SAY WRONG?</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.482" end="00:03:39.887">DON&apos;T WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR STRATEGY IN HUGE WAYS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.887" end="00:03:41.255">&gt;&gt; NO, I DON&apos;T THINK SO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.255" end="00:03:44.491">I DON&apos;T THINK WE SHOULD -- </p>

<p begin="00:03:51.999" end="00:03:54.434">FROM THE LIKELY NEXT-- THAT WAS EXCELLENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.434" end="00:03:55.002">THAT WAS VERY GOOD.</p>

<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:59.333">WE PULLED OUT OF THERE IN 89, 90 91.</p>
