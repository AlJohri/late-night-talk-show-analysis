<p begin="00:00:06.340" end="00:00:12.613">MY GUEST TONIGHT A JOURNALIST WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED &quot;THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE: THE UNLIKELY </p>
<p begin="00:00:12.613" end="00:00:13.981">RISE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN.&quot; PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM,</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.981" end="00:00:15.082">MASHA GESSEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.082" end="00:00:19.486">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.486" end="00:00:24.558">WELCOME TO THE SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.558" end="00:00:25.559">THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.559" end="00:00:31.999">THE BOOK IS ENTITLED &quot;THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE: THE UNLIKELY RISE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:00:31.999" end="00:00:35.435">IS HIS RISE MADE MORE UNLIKELY FOR LACK OF A FACE?</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.435" end="00:00:39.373">(LAUGHTER) IS THAT THE ISSUE THAT PUTIN HAS BEEN FACING?</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.373" end="00:00:43.911">&gt;&gt; I... FACING IT, I DON&apos;T KNOW IF HE&apos;S CAPABLE OF IT, BUT, YES,</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.911" end="00:00:52.019">HE WAS PLUCKED OUT OF NOWHERE IN 1999, COMPLETE UNKNOWN, CHOSEN BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT </p>
<p begin="00:00:52.019" end="00:00:58.358">YELTSIN&apos;S INNER CIRCLE FROM A LINE OF OTHER FACELESS BUREAUCRATS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.358" end="00:01:03.197">AND HE WAS BASICALLY AN ACCIDENTAL PRESIDENT WHO GOT INCREDIBLY LUCKY WITH THE RUSSIAN OIL BOOM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.197" end="00:01:04.097">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY, THEN?</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.097" end="00:01:05.065">WHY PUTIN?</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.065" end="00:01:10.304">BECAUSE YOUR DESCRIPTION OF HIM IN THE BOOK IS HE DOES NOT COME OFF WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.304" end="00:01:17.611">(LAUGHTER) THE FACE THAT WE SEE IS ONE OF A... GENERALLY WHAT SEEMS TO BE A THUGGISH INDIVIDUAL WHO </p>
<p begin="00:01:17.611" end="00:01:18.412">INTIMIDATES OPPONENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.412" end="00:01:23.717">I MEAN, A REAL TYRANT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.717" end="00:01:25.452">DID THEY SEE THAT IN HIM?</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.452" end="00:01:29.590">DID THEY SAY &quot;OOH, I LIKE THE CUT OF THAT FELLA&apos;S JIB&quot;?</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.590" end="00:01:31.658">OR DID THIS ARISE OUT OF NOWHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.658" end="00:01:32.626">&gt;&gt; HE DIDN&apos;T HIDE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.626" end="00:01:34.361">BUT NOBODY WANTED TO SEE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.361" end="00:01:41.568">AND THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT PUTIN IS THAT HE SPENT BASICALLY HIS WHOLE LIFE IN THE K-BG SO HE </p>
<p begin="00:01:41.568" end="00:01:46.106">SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE IN SECRET SO HE GOT TO WRITE HIS OWN STORY WHEN HE BECAME A PUBLIC </p>
<p begin="00:01:46.106" end="00:01:48.675">POLITICIAN AND THE STORY HE WROTE IS ONE OF A STREET TOUGH,</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.675" end="00:01:54.681">A THUG, SOMEBODY WHO CAN&apos;T END A FIGHT, SOMEBODY WHO HAS TROUBLE CONTROLLING HIS TEMPER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.681" end="00:01:59.386">THAT&apos;S PRETTY MUCH ALL HE TALKED TO HIS BIOGRAPHERS AND IN EARLY 2000.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.386" end="00:02:03.624">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN HE SPOKE WITH THEM, HIS BIOGRAPHERS, WAS HE WEARING A SHIRT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.624" end="00:02:08.128">BECAUSE THE OTHER THING THAT COMES UP OFTEN IS HE LIKES TO SHOW HIS OWN NIPPLES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.128" end="00:02:13.800">(LAUGHTER) AND I... IT&apos;S SURPRISING FOR A TYRANT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:18.105">&gt;&gt; RIGHT WELL T-SHIRTLESS THING BEGAN A LITTLE LATER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.105" end="00:02:19.840">(LAUGHTER) THAT BEGAN IN 2005.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.840" end="00:02:21.074">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M SORRY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.074" end="00:02:24.311">I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU&apos;RE ADDRESSING ME ON SERIOUS TERMS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.311" end="00:02:25.479">I THINK THAT&apos;S...</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.479" end="00:02:25.879">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.879" end="00:02:27.781">I THINK THAT&apos;S EXCELLENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.781" end="00:02:29.850">(APPLAUSE) WHEN IS THE ELECTION?</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.850" end="00:02:30.784">WHEN IS HIS ELECTION?</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.784" end="00:02:33.687">&gt;&gt; HIS ELECTION IS ON SUNDAY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.687" end="00:02:34.121">MARCH 4.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.121" end="00:02:37.391">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT ARE THE ODDS MAKERS SAYING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.391" end="00:02:40.661">&gt;&gt; HE IS PLANNING TO WIN THE ELECTION IN THE FIRST ROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.661" end="00:02:41.495">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:41.495" end="00:02:46.667">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW, IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER PEOPLE TAKING TO THE STREETS IN </p>
<p begin="00:02:46.667" end="00:02:48.869">NUMBERS TO PROTEST VLADIMIR PUTIN?</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.869" end="00:02:49.770">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.770" end="00:02:52.406">IT&apos;S ACTUALLY UNPRECEDENTED, THE AMOUNT OF PROTEST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.406" end="00:02:56.944">WE HAVEN&apos;T SEEN ANYTHING THIS HUGE SINCE BEFORE THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.944" end="00:03:06.053">AND WE HAVEN&apos;T SEEN ANYTHING THIS SUSTAINED AND THIS MUCH OF A STREET MOVEMENT EVER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.053" end="00:03:07.921">&gt;&gt; Jon: DOES THIS DEMYSTIFY HIM?</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.921" end="00:03:12.459">IF YOU REMOVE THE CLOAK OF INVINCIBILITY FROM PUTIN, DOES HE COLLAPSE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.459" end="00:03:16.296">WILL HE... WHEREVER YOU SEE A BOOK THAT SAYS &quot;THE UNLIKELY </p>
<p begin="00:03:16.296" end="00:03:20.100">RISE,&quot; YOU ALWAYS KNOW THE NEXT BOOK IS &quot;THE LIKELY FALL.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:20.100" end="00:03:21.201">&gt;&gt; I HOPE SO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.201" end="00:03:22.269">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.269" end="00:03:27.207">SO AFTER... YOU FEEL HE&apos;S... HIS TYPE OF T +*EURNY... BECAUSE FOR </p>
<p begin="00:03:27.207" end="00:03:31.144">ME, BOY, TO RETURN TO THOSE COLD WAR SIMPLE DAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.144" end="00:03:31.512">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:03:31.512" end="00:03:32.312">&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.312" end="00:03:34.781">WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY NOW BECAUSE I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER THIS </p>
<p begin="00:03:34.781" end="00:03:35.716">IS GOING TO LAST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.716" end="00:03:42.923">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU THINK HE&apos;S... YOU REALLY THINK THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON VLADIMIR PUTIN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.923" end="00:03:43.857">&gt;&gt; I THINK SO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.857" end="00:03:48.695">BECAUSE THE POWER STRUCTURE HE HAS BUILT RESTS ON FEAR AND PERSONAL CONNECTIONS AND MONEY </p>
<p begin="00:03:48.695" end="00:03:52.566">AND THE FEAR IS BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE EQUATION AND THAT MEANS THE WHOLE THING WILL COLLAPSE </p>
<p begin="00:03:52.566" end="00:03:54.234">AND I THINK IT WILL HAPPEN SOON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.234" end="00:04:01.041">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE IS NOT KIND TO HIS CRITICS AND THERE IS ALL KINDS OF-- AS WE SAY IN MY LANGUAGE-- </p>
<p begin="00:04:01.041" end="00:04:03.877">MILITIA GOSS THAT GOES ON WITH PEOPLE THAT WRITE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.877" end="00:04:07.447">WERE YOU TREPIDATIOUS AT ALL TO TAKE THIS PROJECT ON?</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.447" end="00:04:07.915">MILITIAS GO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.915" end="00:04:11.218">&gt;&gt; I TRIED TO KEEP IT SECRET THAT I WAS WORKING ON IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.218" end="00:04:14.888">&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY, THIS IS GOING TO BE ON TELEVISION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.888" end="00:04:17.324">(LAUGHTER) I&apos;M NOT SUGGESTING THIS AIRS IN RUSSIA BUT...</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.324" end="00:04:17.925">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.925" end="00:04:19.660">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU ARE TALKING TO ME ON TELEVISION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.660" end="00:04:21.061">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.061" end="00:04:23.864">I&apos;M AWARE OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.864" end="00:04:25.899">(LAUGHTER) AND THE BOOK IS...</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.899" end="00:04:28.602">(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:04:28.602" end="00:04:31.939">&gt;&gt; Jon: I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW...</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.939" end="00:04:34.675">&gt;&gt; THE BOOK IS DUE TO BE PUBLISHED TOMORROW SO I DON&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:04:34.675" end="00:04:37.778">THINK I&apos;M GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP A SECRET FOR MUCH LONGER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.778" end="00:04:42.816">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S INTERESTING BECAUSE MAYBE THIS DOES HELP RETAKE CRITICAL MASS WHERE YOU </p>
<p begin="00:04:42.816" end="00:04:48.622">DEMYSTIFY THE DICTATOR TO THE POINT WHERE HE LOSES HIS POWER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.622" end="00:04:56.597">YOU WRITE A LOT OF ANECDOTES OF HIS... HIS EARLY LIFE, EVEN THE WAY THAT HE PROPOSED TO HIS WIFE </p>
<p begin="00:04:56.597" end="00:04:57.831">IS SO REVELTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.831" end="00:04:59.099">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S AMAZING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.099" end="00:05:05.472">THEY DATED FOR THREE YEARS HIS WIFE DESCRIBES THE PROPOSAL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.472" end="00:05:08.208">HE SAID TO HER &quot;WELL, WE&apos;VE BEEN DATING FOR THREE YEARS SO YOU </p>
<p begin="00:05:08.208" end="00:05:11.245">KNOW THE KIND OF MAN I AM.&quot; AND SHE THOUGHT &quot;WELL, HE&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:05:11.245" end="00:05:12.746">CLEARLY BREAKING UP WITH ME.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:12.746" end="00:05:16.250">&gt;&gt; Jon: BECAUSE SHE KNEW WHAT KIND OF MAN HE WAS!</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.250" end="00:05:17.050">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.050" end="00:05:20.287">AND SO SHE SAID &quot;YES, I KNOW WHAT KIND OF MAN YOU ARE.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:20.287" end="00:05:24.391">HE SAID &quot;IN THAT CASE, I&apos;VE MADE A DECISION.&quot; AND SHE KNEW HE WAS BREAKING UP </p>
<p begin="00:05:24.391" end="00:05:28.362">WITH HER AND THAT&apos;S WHEN HE SAID &quot;LET&apos;S GET MARE NEED A MONTH.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:28.362" end="00:05:29.062">(AUDIENCE REACTS).</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.062" end="00:05:31.765">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND HE SAID &quot;YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF MAN I AM.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:31.765" end="00:05:33.400">AND HE LISTED THE KIND OF MAN HE IS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:36.904">&gt;&gt; RIGHT, NOT A NICE PERSON TO BE WITH, KIND OF INCONVENIENT,</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.904" end="00:05:38.906">BAD AT EXPRESSING HIS EMOTIONS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.906" end="00:05:39.907">AS HE WAS DEMONSTRATING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.907" end="00:05:44.578">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS HIS PITCH TO THE WOMAN HE&apos;S GOING TO MARRY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.578" end="00:05:47.481">(LAUGHTER) I WONDER IF THE SHIRT WAS ON AT THAT TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.481" end="00:05:56.590">I WONDER IF HE SAID ALL THAT AND HE SAID OKAY, BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE... YOU KNOW?</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.590" end="00:05:58.992">IT IS... IT&apos;S A REMARKABLE STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.992" end="00:06:06.700">WHEN YOU BREAK DOWN A FEARED LEADER, HUMANIZING THEM IS SUCH A WEAPON IN A WEIRD WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.700" end="00:06:07.334">&gt;&gt; Jon: .</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.334" end="00:06:10.537">&gt;&gt; WELL, I FOUND IT HARD TO HUMANIZE HIM.</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.938" end="00:06:12.206">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.</p>

<p begin="00:06:17.211" end="00:06:17.911">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.911" end="00:06:19.046">HE&apos;S A SMALL GUY.</p>
