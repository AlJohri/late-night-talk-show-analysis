<p begin="00:01:10.637" end="00:01:15.509">&gt;&gt; TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY BROUGHT THE ISSUE OVER THE PRESIDENT&apos;S BIRTH CERTIFICATE </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:18.545">BACK IN THE HEADLINES IN AN INTERVIEW WITH PARADE MAGAZINE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.545" end="00:01:24.651">&gt;&gt; PERRY SUGGESTED HE WENT QUITE SURE IF THE PRESIDENT&apos;S BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS LEGIT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.651" end="00:01:28.121">&gt;&gt; Jon: DIDN&apos;T THAT BOAT SAIL LAST SPRING?</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.121" end="00:01:37.397">APPARENTLY RICK PERRY, SEEN HERE ON THE COVER OF PARADE MAGAZINE, SUGGESTED...</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.397" end="00:01:40.367">SUGGESTIVELY OFFERING THE NATION HIS NIPPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.367" end="00:01:43.103">&quot;HEY, AMERICA, HEY, AMERICA.</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.407" end="00:01:54.014">DO YOU WANT TO SUCKAL?&quot; &quot;THAT&apos;S GOOD TEAT RIGHT THERE.</p>

<p begin="00:02:01.154" end="00:02:06.059">MONTHS AGO THAT SUGGESTS PERHAPS NONE OF US HAVE SEEN THE PRESIDENT&apos;S REAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.059" end="00:02:07.427">THIS REPRESENTS PROGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.427" end="00:02:12.499">RIGHT NOW HE&apos;S ONLY SIX MONTHS BEHIND THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.499" end="00:02:16.837">BUT HIS N-WORD FAMILY HUNTING GROUND WAS LIKE 150 YEARS BEHIND.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.837" end="00:02:21.508">SO IN MANY WAYS PERRY IS ACTUALLY GAINING TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.508" end="00:02:24.578">NORMALLY PERRY GOES BIRTHER,</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.578" end="00:02:25.179">NO TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.179" end="00:02:31.218">&gt;&gt; HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR WAS SUPPOSED TO PEEK AT PEN WHARTON SCHOOL OF BUSINESS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.218" end="00:02:36.356">&gt;&gt; BUT HIS OFFICE CANCELED THE APPEARANCE AFTER LEARNING 300 SEATS WOULD BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.356" end="00:02:38.825">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, THE PUBLIC.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.825" end="00:02:45.832">HEAVENS TO BETSY, WELL, I NEVER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.832" end="00:02:46.533">I&apos;M SORRY.</p>

<p begin="00:03:03.450" end="00:03:06.353">INEQUALITY BUT YOU CANCEL IT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.353" end="00:03:13.694">I GUESS TO ERIC CANTOR 300 EMPTY SEATS FEELS LIKE THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.694" end="00:03:17.231">THE POOR HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.231" end="00:03:17.764">NEXT STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.764" end="00:03:25.072">&gt;&gt; SO TODAY I CAN REPORT THAT AS PROMISED, THE REST OF OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ WILL COME HOME </p>
<p begin="00:03:25.072" end="00:03:27.207">BY THE END OF THE YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.207" end="00:03:30.210">AFTER NEARLY NINE YEARS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.210" end="00:03:32.846">AMERICA&apos;S WAR IN IRAQ WILL BE OVER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.846" end="00:03:34.248">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S OVER.</p>

<p begin="00:03:41.154" end="00:03:43.090">IT&apos;S FINALLY OVER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.090" end="00:03:44.224">OH, MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.224" end="00:03:48.128">LET ME TELL YOU THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.128" end="00:03:48.495">WOO-HOOO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.495" end="00:03:53.300">&gt;&gt; THEY EITHER FAILED TO DO IT BY VIRTUE OF INEPTITUDE OR THEY DECIDED THAT IT WASN&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:03:53.300" end="00:03:56.203">THAT IMPORTANT POLITICALLY OR OTHERWISE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.203" end="00:03:59.239">&gt;&gt; THIS WAS A FAILURE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO CLOSE THE DEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.239" end="00:04:01.608">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT&apos;S A SERIOUS MISTAKE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.608" end="00:04:05.479">&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A FAILURE WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.479" end="00:04:09.383">&gt;&gt; Jon: BRINGING SOLDIERS HOME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.383" end="00:04:17.057">THEN THEY&apos;RE GOING TO COME AND TAKE OUR JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.057" end="00:04:24.631">YEAH, WHAT IS OBAMA DOING PULLING OUR TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ BY THE END OF THE YEAR 2011.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.631" end="00:04:25.732">WHO&apos;S STUPID IDEA WAS THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.732" end="00:04:29.303">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE HERE AT THE REQUEST OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT, THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.303" end="00:04:35.576">THERE ARE CERTAIN BENCHMARKS THAT WILL BE MET SUCH AS TROOPS OUT OF THE CITIES BY JUNE OF &apos;09.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.576" end="00:04:37.711">THEN THERE&apos;S A BENCHMARK AT THE END OF THE AGREEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.711" end="00:04:38.378">&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.378" end="00:04:41.648">THE STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT BUSH SIGNED WITH THE IRAQIS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.648" end="00:04:46.386">I WONDER WHAT WAS THE BENCHMARK AT THE END OF THAT AGREEMENT THAT HE SIGNED WITH </p>
<p begin="00:04:46.386" end="00:04:46.987">THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.987" end="00:04:47.421">HERE IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.421" end="00:04:54.094">ALL THE UNITED STATES FORCES SHALL WITHDRAW NO LATER THAN DECEMBER 31, 2011.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.094" end="00:04:56.363">OOPS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.363" end="00:05:06.373">WHY DIDN&apos;T THE POINT OF THAT SPEECH GET MORE COVERAGE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.413" end="00:05:22.256">TODAY WE ARE REPORTING NEWS THAT THE AMERICAN FORCES PLEDGED TO LEAVE IRAQ BY-- SHOE!</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.256" end="00:05:26.326">DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT REASONS FOR DISLIKING OBAMA&apos;S RADICAL DECISION TO DO THE THING </p>
<p begin="00:05:26.326" end="00:05:27.961">GEORGE BUSH SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.961" end="00:05:31.198">&gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY TIME WE HAVE DEPOSED A DICTATOR,</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.198" end="00:05:36.904">THE UNITED STATES HAS ALWAYS LEFT TROOPS BEHIND TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE FRAGILE PEACE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.904" end="00:05:43.510">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOUR SEASON IS BUT WE NEVER LEAVE COUNTRIES WE&apos;VE INVADED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.510" end="00:05:46.146">YOU MUST THEN BE HAPPY ABOUT THE WAY THINGS WENT IN LIBYA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.146" end="00:05:49.650">WE GOT RID OF THE DICTATOR WITHOUT EVER COMMITTING GROUND FORS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.650" end="00:05:52.853">&gt;&gt; I OPPOSED THE PRESIDENT PUTTING US INTO WAR IN LIBYA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.853" end="00:05:56.990">ONE THING WE SHOULD HAVE LEARNED IN THE LAST 12 YEARS IS THAT ONCE WE ARE INVOLVED </p>
<p begin="00:05:56.990" end="00:06:02.262">IN A FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT, IN A FOREIGN ENTANGLEMENT, IT&apos;S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.262" end="00:06:04.164">IT&apos;S USUALLY AT A GREAT PRICE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.164" end="00:06:08.836">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND I RESENT THIS PRESIDENT HELPING TO DEPOSE QADDAFI WITHOUT THE </p>
<p begin="00:06:08.836" end="00:06:13.040">COMPLICATIONS AND COSTS OF A NEVER-ENDING OCCUPATION.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.040" end="00:06:14.708">IT&apos;S FRANKLY UNAMERICAN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.708" end="00:06:17.778">I WON&apos;T STAND FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.778" end="00:06:21.715">BACHMANN&apos;S OCCUPY WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT STREET PROTESTS OVER OUR PULLOUT FROM IRAQ IS </p>
<p begin="00:06:21.715" end="00:06:25.519">AT LEAST MORE WELCOME THAN THE BALLS OF SENATORS McCAIN AND GRAHAM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.519" end="00:06:27.354">I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT MENTAL IMAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.354" end="00:06:29.756">&gt;&gt; WELL I THINK IT&apos;S A SERIOUS MISTAKE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.756" end="00:06:30.924">I&apos;M HERE IN THE REGION.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.924" end="00:06:35.662">YES, IT IS VIEWED IN THE REGION AS A VICTORY FOR THE IRANIANS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.662" end="00:06:37.598">I DON&apos;T THINK THERE&apos;S ANY DOUBT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.598" end="00:06:40.834">&gt;&gt; THEY ENDD IRAQ POORLY FUMBLED THE BALL INSIDE OF THE TENT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.834" end="00:06:44.838">IT WAS HIS JOB, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION&apos;S JOB TO END THIS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.838" end="00:06:45.572">THEY FAILED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.572" end="00:06:48.275">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU SEE IT WAS OUR JOB TO START IT BADLY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.275" end="00:06:49.943">WE DID THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.943" end="00:06:52.980">WE WERE (BEEP) IDIOTS.</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.691" end="00:07:12.866">TO GO OUGHT WALDORF ON THE EXIT, IT&apos;S JUST LIKE THE CAPTAIN OF THE EXXON VALDEZ </p>
