<p begin="00:00:11.445" end="00:00:15.482">BUT THEY OFTEN SAY VERY STUPID THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.482" end="00:00:19.019">ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO HEADED FISH A NEERING IDAHO&apos;S RIVERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.019" end="00:00:21.722">THAT IS JUST WRONG.</p>

<p begin="00:00:25.726" end="00:00:32.699">BUT ACCORDING TO CONSERVATIONIST MARV HOYT THERE IS A DARK SECRET LURKING IN THESE WATERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.699" end="00:00:37.237">&gt;&gt; THE FISH ARE SUFFERING MASSIVE DEFORMITIES,</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.237" end="00:00:40.607">DEFORMITIES YOU JUST DON&apos;T SEE IN NATURE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.607" end="00:00:41.241">&gt;&gt; LIKE WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.241" end="00:00:43.277">&gt;&gt; TWO HEADS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.277" end="00:00:44.211">&gt;&gt; TWO HEADS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.211" end="00:00:48.015">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.015" end="00:00:49.383">&gt;&gt; OH THAT&apos;S A FISH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.383" end="00:00:49.750">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.750" end="00:00:51.852">&gt;&gt; THOSE ARE HEADS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.852" end="00:00:52.786">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>

<p begin="00:00:55.556" end="00:00:56.957">WHAT IS CAUSING THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.957" end="00:01:02.062">&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT WAS SELENIUM IN THE WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.062" end="00:01:07.067">(APPLAUSE) AND WHAT IS SELENIUM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.067" end="00:01:12.239">&gt;&gt; IT TURNS OUT SELENIUM IS A TOXIC BYPRODUCT OF PHOSPHATE MINING, AND IN </p>
<p begin="00:01:12.239" end="00:01:18.645">SOUTHEAST IDAHO, ONE COMPANY LOVES MINING PHOSPHATE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.645" end="00:01:21.415">&gt;&gt; THE COMPANY THAT OPERATES THE SMOKY CANYON MINES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.415" end="00:01:25.519">&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU SHOWN SIMPLOT THESE MUTE ANT FISH PICTURES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.519" end="00:01:31.358">&gt;&gt; THOSE PICTURES CAME FROM SIMPLOT&apos;S OWN REPORTS THAT THEY COMMISSIONED IN ORDER </p>
<p begin="00:01:31.358" end="00:01:34.361">TO GET AROUND THE CURRENT SELENIUM STANDARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.361" end="00:01:40.200">&gt;&gt; YOU SEE, WITH SIX OF SIMPLOT&apos;S SIX IDAHOS TO MATE-- PHOSPHATE MINES CITED </p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:46.006">FOR GROSSLY EXCEEDING FEDERAL SELENIUM LIMITS SIMPLOT 250K ACTION AND ISSUED A REPORT SAYING THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:46.006" end="00:01:47.708">FEDERAL LIMITS NEEDED TO BE HIGHER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.708" end="00:01:51.778">I WENT TO SIMPLOT TO TALK IT OVER WITH A COMPANY SPOKESMAN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.778" end="00:01:55.249">&gt;&gt; YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT THIS EXCITING TWO HEADED FISH THAT YOU GUYS ARE DEVELOPING?</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.249" end="00:01:57.985">&gt;&gt; WE REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU LEAVE THE PREMISES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.985" end="00:01:59.152">THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.152" end="00:02:01.054">&gt;&gt; ARE YOU-- WHO ARE YOU CALLING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.054" end="00:02:01.388">&gt;&gt;.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.388" end="00:02:04.324">&gt;&gt; HI, THIS IS DAVID AT THE SIMPLOT HEADQUARTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.324" end="00:02:08.262">WE HAVE SOME PESKY REPORTERS HERE WHO WON&apos;T LEAVE AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU </p>
<p begin="00:02:08.262" end="00:02:10.631">WOULD SEND AN OFFICER TO ESCORT THEM OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.631" end="00:02:16.637">&gt;&gt; SURE, SIMPLOT CAN BULLY ME BUT WAIT UNTIL THE EPA GETS THEIR HANDS ON THE REPORT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.637" end="00:02:20.908">&gt;&gt; ALL OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES REVIEWED THE REPORT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.908" end="00:02:22.276">&gt;&gt; WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.276" end="00:02:25.679">YOU ARE SAYING THE EPA SAW THIS REPORT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.679" end="00:02:26.213">&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.213" end="00:02:28.148">&gt;&gt; I BET THEY WERE PISSED,</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.148" end="00:02:28.482">RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.482" end="00:02:30.517">&gt;&gt; NO, THEY WERE NOT PISSED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.517" end="00:02:35.622">THEY FAILED TO CAUSE A FACT THAT THERE WERE TWO HEADED FISH DEFORMITIES WERE IN THAT REPORT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.622" end="00:02:36.290">&gt;&gt; THAT CAN&apos;T RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.290" end="00:02:39.359">BUT IN FACT, THE EPA CALLED THE REPORT OUTSTANDING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.359" end="00:02:43.997">AND THEY MAY EVEN USE IT TO ADDRESS NATIONAL SELENIUM STANDARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.997" end="00:02:48.235">WHEN INTERVIEW REQUESTS TO THE EPA WERE IGNORED I HEADED TO THEIR OFFICES TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:48.235" end="00:02:52.739">SEE HOW THEY COULD OVERLOOK A TWO HEADED FISH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.739" end="00:02:53.407">HI.</p>

<p begin="00:03:14.228" end="00:03:17.364">&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD THE EPA CALL HOMELAND SECURITY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.364" end="00:03:21.435">I NEEDED ANSWERSMENT BUT EVERYWHERE I WENT NO ONE WOULD TALK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.435" end="00:03:23.070">WHAT IS THIS?</p>
