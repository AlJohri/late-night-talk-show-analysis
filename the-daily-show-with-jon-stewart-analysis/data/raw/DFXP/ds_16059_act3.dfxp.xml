<p begin="00:00:06.640" end="00:00:14.047">MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AMERICAN HISTORIAN AND THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF WALLBUILDERS, DAVID BARTON.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.047" end="00:00:15.315">SIR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.315" end="00:00:15.816">APPRECIATE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.816" end="00:00:18.819">SIT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.819" end="00:00:19.219">[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.219" end="00:00:19.887">THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.887" end="00:00:20.954">&gt;&gt; MY PLEASURE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.954" end="00:00:24.124">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO HERE&apos;S WHAT HAPPENED, SO WE HAVE MIKE HUCKABEE ON THE SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.124" end="00:00:25.459">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.459" end="00:00:26.059">GOOD GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.059" end="00:00:28.128">&gt;&gt; Jon: VERY NICE GUY, GOOD FRIEND OF THE SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.128" end="00:00:30.230">WE ALWAYS HAVE REALLY INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.230" end="00:00:31.798">SO I&apos;M WATCHING HIM PRAISE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.798" end="00:00:33.600">HE WAS AT A CONFERENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.600" end="00:00:37.638">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.638" end="00:00:41.942">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE SAID DAVID BARTON IS THE GREATEST HISTORIAN IN AMERICA AND ALL CHILDREN SHOULD </p>
<p begin="00:00:41.942" end="00:00:44.211">HAVE TO LEARN FROM HIM IN THEIR CURRICULUM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.211" end="00:00:45.078">I&apos;M PARAPHRASING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.078" end="00:00:45.913">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.913" end="00:00:50.517">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, WELL, GEEZ, I&apos;D LIKE THE MEET THE GREATEST HISTORIAN IN AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.517" end="00:00:53.587">THEN I STARTED LOOKING UP YOUR STUFF, AND I THOUGHT, OKAY...</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.587" end="00:00:55.455">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A DANGEROUS THING TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.455" end="00:00:56.256">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS SEEMS ODD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.256" end="00:01:00.761">SO I ASKED MIKE HUCKABEE ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU&apos;VE BEEN SAYING, AND HE SAID, WHY </p>
<p begin="00:01:00.761" end="00:01:02.596">DON&apos;T YOU ASK DAVID BARTON HIMSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.596" end="00:01:05.232">AND I SAID, OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.232" end="00:01:07.234">AND HERE I AM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.234" end="00:01:08.202">SO HERE YOU ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.202" end="00:01:13.373">SO LET ME ASK YOU, JUST FOR OUR AUDIENCE THAT IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT YOU DORK HOW WOULD YOU </p>
<p begin="00:01:13.373" end="00:01:14.474">DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS YOU DO?</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.474" end="00:01:17.077">&gt;&gt; I&apos;D SAY HISTORICAL RECLAMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.077" end="00:01:21.114">WE AND OUR COMPANY HAVE ABOUT 100,000 DOCUMENTS FROM BEFORE 1812.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.114" end="00:01:25.719">SO DOCUMENTS OUT OF BLACK HISTORY, OUT OF RELIGIOUS HISTORY, CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY,</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.719" end="00:01:26.720">YOU NAME IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.720" end="00:01:29.223">WE&apos;VE GOT 100,000 ORIGINALS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.223" end="00:01:33.093">THAT&apos;S WHAT WE TAKE A LOT OF HISTORY BACK TO, THOSE ORIGINAL THINGS THAT HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.093" end="00:01:37.831">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMS THE HISTORY YOU TAKE COMES BACK TO THE IDEA THAT WE ARE A MORE </p>
<p begin="00:01:37.831" end="00:01:40.300">CHRISTIAN NATION THAN WE ARE LIVING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.300" end="00:01:40.968">IS THAT...</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.968" end="00:01:42.269">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S NOT ACCURATE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.269" end="00:01:45.772">THERE&apos;S PEOPLE WHO POINT THAT OUT, BUT I&apos;LL GIVE YOU A GOOD EXAMPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.772" end="00:01:49.610">IN TEXAS I WAS APPOINTED AS AN EXPERT TO DO HISTORY IN GOVERNMENT STANDARDS THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.610" end="00:01:54.114">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU ARE A CURRICULUM AUTHORITY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.114" end="00:01:55.782">&gt;&gt; FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.782" end="00:02:00.220">CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, ALL THESE STATEDS, I DO THEIR HISTORY AND SOCIAL STUDIES STANDARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.220" end="00:02:03.323">SO I&apos;M ASKED BY THE GOUGH OR BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.323" end="00:02:06.927">&gt;&gt; AND THIS MAY BE A MISCONCEPTION, BUT YOU DON&apos;T...</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.927" end="00:02:10.597">YOU ARE NOT A HISTORIAN IN TERMS OF ACADEMIC HISTORIAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.597" end="00:02:12.065">YOU DON&apos;T HAVE A DOCTORATE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.065" end="00:02:12.566"> &gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.566" end="00:02:13.834">I&apos;VE GOT ALL THE DOCUMENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.834" end="00:02:16.336">THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S BEEN A LOT OF FUN BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH HISTORY </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.336" end="00:02:20.774">AND SCHOOL AND WHAT I GOT TAUGHT AND WHAT I SEE IN THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS AREN&apos;T THE SAME THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.774" end="00:02:23.410">THAT&apos;S WHAT GOT ME STARTED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.410" end="00:02:26.079">SOME REALLY OLD DOCUMENTS CONTRA DINGTED MY SCHOOL BOOKS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.079" end="00:02:28.916">SO WE SAY PUBLISHERS, HERE&apos;S WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS ARE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.916" end="00:02:29.750">PRINT THE DOCUMENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.750" end="00:02:31.185">GO BACK TO THE ORIGINALS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.185" end="00:02:36.623">ON THE ISSUE OF RELIGION, BEING ONE OF THE GUYS APPOINTED IN TEXAS, ALL MY REVIEWS ARE ONLINE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.623" end="00:02:40.994">THERE&apos;S 43,000 WORDS ONLINE OF MY REVIEWS OVER THE LAST SET OF STANDARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.994" end="00:02:43.597">ONLY TWO SUBJECTS DO I EVER MENTION CHRISTIANITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.597" end="00:02:48.302">ONE WAS THE TEACHER&apos;S RECOMMENDED TAKING THE STUDY OF CHRISTMAS OUT OF THE HOLIDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.302" end="00:02:51.672">&gt;&gt; YOU ARE SAYING YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN...</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.672" end="00:02:52.840">&gt;&gt; OH, I AM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.840" end="00:02:53.974">I AM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.974" end="00:02:54.508">&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.508" end="00:02:56.109">&gt;&gt; AS AN EMPHASIS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.109" end="00:02:59.146">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S YOUR ALMOST TOTAL EMPHASIS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.146" end="00:03:00.280">&gt;&gt; NO, IT&apos;S NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.280" end="00:03:00.848">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.848" end="00:03:03.884">&gt;&gt; I KNOW THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT GO AFTER ME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.884" end="00:03:09.089">AND WHEN I WAS ON THE TEXAS BOARD, THERE&apos;S A GROUP THAT DID A PRESS RELEASE AND ALL OF A </p>
<p begin="00:03:09.089" end="00:03:12.059">SUDDEN MSNBC AND THE &quot;TIMES,&quot; ALL THESE GROUPS...</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.059" end="00:03:15.562">&gt;&gt; BARTON IS CRAMMING CHRISTIANITY DOWN THEIR THROATS IN TEXAS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.562" end="00:03:18.799">NO, THERE&apos;S 43,000 WORDS, TWO REFERENCES TO CHRISTIANITY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.799" end="00:03:20.901">THAT&apos;S NOT A SUPER BIG EMPHASIS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.901" end="00:03:23.403">NOT THAT THAT&apos;S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME, BUT WHAT I TEACH...</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.403" end="00:03:26.073">&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY IN LEVITICUS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.073" end="00:03:27.407">BEING DAY IS MENTIONED TWICE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.407" end="00:03:30.744">BUT PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT KIND OF MAKE A BIG EMPHASIS OUT OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.744" end="00:03:32.613">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S NOT A HISTORY ISSUE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.613" end="00:03:34.982">&gt;&gt; Jon:, NO BUT I&apos;M SAYING I DON&apos;T KNOW THAT...</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.982" end="00:03:37.551">&gt;&gt; LETS ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.551" end="00:03:38.218">&gt;&gt; Jon: PLEASE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.218" end="00:03:41.522">&gt;&gt; PUBLISHERS COME TO ME AND SAY YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE STANDARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.522" end="00:03:44.892">AND I WHAWNS MY NAME EVOKES, SO I TOLD THE PUBLISHERS, I&apos;LL BE </p>
<p begin="00:03:44.892" end="00:03:47.995">THE EDITOR, BUT DON&apos;T PUT MY NAME IN THE NEXT BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.995" end="00:03:54.101">THAT TEXTBOOK I EDITED IS THE BESTSELLING PUBLISHED SCHOOL TEXTBOOK MANY AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.101" end="00:03:55.636">HISTORIANS THINK IT&apos;S A GREAT BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.636" end="00:03:57.504">THEY DON&apos;T KNOW I DID IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.504" end="00:03:58.939">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, NOT HISTORIANS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.939" end="00:04:00.407">&gt;&gt; TEACHERSEN </p>
<p begin="00:04:00.407" end="00:04:03.710">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN TEXAS MAKES A BOOK, IT&apos;S NOT A FREE MARKET THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.710" end="00:04:07.614">&gt;&gt; IT WAS BECAUSE I WORKED AT THE PUBLISHERS, NOT THE STANDARD IN TEXAS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.614" end="00:04:08.916">THE PUBLISHERS CAME TO ME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.916" end="00:04:11.752">&gt;&gt; Jon: MORE PEOPLE ARE BUYING IT, IT&apos;S CLEARLY BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.752" end="00:04:14.755">&gt;&gt; WELL, YEAH, EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.755" end="00:04:15.055">BUT...</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.055" end="00:04:17.958">&gt;&gt; Jon: I THINK THE MAKERS OF CRACK MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.958" end="00:04:21.795">BUT LET&apos;S GET TO YOU BECAUSE I DO... YOU ARE AN IMPORTANT FIGURE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.795" end="00:04:24.198">YOU GO IN AND YOU ARGUE IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.198" end="00:04:28.068">YOU GO IN AND YOU WORK WITH OUR CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.068" end="00:04:29.570">YOU WORK WITH CONGRESS PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.570" end="00:04:36.643">YOU GO IN AND YOU WRITE CURRICULUM, AND I CAN&apos;T HELP BUT THINK THAT, AND IN YOUR </p>
<p begin="00:04:36.643" end="00:04:39.279">WRITINGS, YOU TALK ABOUT RECLAIMING OUR FORGOTTEN HISTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.279" end="00:04:40.614">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.614" end="00:04:44.651">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN IT SEEMS TO ME SOMEONE WHO PROBABLY HAS A VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THIS </p>
<p begin="00:04:44.651" end="00:04:47.454">NATION&apos;S HISTORY THAT YOU ARE REWRITING MORE THAN RECLAIMING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.454" end="00:04:49.656">&gt;&gt; LET ME GIVE A SHOT AT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.656" end="00:04:54.294">ONE THING I&apos;M REALLY PROUD ABOUT THAT WE GOT DONE IN TEXAS IS WE TOOK THE NUMBER OF MINORITIES </p>
<p begin="00:04:54.294" end="00:04:58.932">WHO ARE COVERED IN THE STANDARDS FROM 9% TO 25%.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.932" end="00:05:06.673">THE WAY I DID IT IS SAID WE&apos;RE NOT COVERING ANY OF THE JEWISH FOUNDING FATHERS OR THE BLACK </p>
<p begin="00:05:06.673" end="00:05:08.775">FOUNDING FATHERS, THE WOMEN OF THE REVOLUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.775" end="00:05:11.411">WE&apos;RE ALSO NOT COVERING HISPANICS IN THE REVOLUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.411" end="00:05:12.679">THAT&apos;S FORGOTTEN HISTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.679" end="00:05:16.683">I BET YOU MOST JEWISH PEOPLE CAN&apos;T NAME THE JEWISH FOUNDING FATHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.683" end="00:05:17.784">&gt;&gt; Jon: I CAN.</p>

<p begin="00:05:18.952" end="00:05:20.387">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>

<p begin="00:05:24.892" end="00:05:25.759">THAT&apos;S ALL I GOT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:26.760">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.760" end="00:05:31.965">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO I AM INCORRECT IN SAYING THAT YOU... I&apos;VE SEEN </p>
<p begin="00:05:31.965" end="00:05:38.405">TAPES OF YOU SPEAKING WHERE YOU MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THE BIBLE, THINGS LIKE </p>
<p begin="00:05:38.405" end="00:05:44.811">I WOULD LIKE THE SEE THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND THE ESTATE TAX GONE BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS SO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.811" end="00:05:45.312">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.312" end="00:05:48.782">BUT THOSE ARE ALSO SPEECHES GIVEN TO GROUPS OF MINISTERS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.782" end="00:05:50.184">AND I&apos;M SPEAKING TO MINISTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.184" end="00:05:51.285">THAT&apos;S NOT A TEXTBOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.285" end="00:05:53.187">THAT&apos;S A WHOLE DIFFERENT SETTING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.187" end="00:05:54.154">FOR EXAMPLE...</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.154" end="00:05:56.390">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE SAYING THERE IS A WALL OF SEPARATION?</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.390" end="00:05:57.224">&gt;&gt; THERE IS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.224" end="00:06:00.327">AND THAT IS... YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT CAME FROM,</p>

<p begin="00:06:01.528" end="00:06:04.798">&gt;&gt; Jon: A WALL OF SEPARATION WITHIN YOU OF CHURCH AND STATE?</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.798" end="00:06:08.135">&gt;&gt; NO, NO, ANY MORE THAN THE FOUNDERS WANTED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.135" end="00:06:11.638">THEY WANTED SEPARATION OF THE INSTITUTIONS, NEVER SEPARATION OF THE INFLUENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.638" end="00:06:13.540">NEVER AT ANY POINT DID THEY SAY...</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.540" end="00:06:15.742">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD HERE BECAUSE THAT&apos;S </p>

<p begin="00:06:53.447" end="00:06:57.184">WHEN YOU READ THE FEDERALIST PAPERS, THEY SAID RELIGION BELONGS TO THE STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.184" end="00:07:00.854">YOU READ THE STATE CONSTITUTIONS, THEY&apos;RE EXTREMELY GRAPHIC ON RELIGION, BUT THERE </p>

<p begin="00:07:18.872" end="00:07:20.140">YOU HAVE TO BE THIS AGE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.140" end="00:07:22.042">BLACK PEOPLE COUNTED FOR THREE-FIFTHS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.042" end="00:07:23.043">THEY USED FRACTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.043" end="00:07:25.379">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S ONLY FEDERAL OFFICE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.379" end="00:07:26.813">THAT&apos;S NOT RELIGION.</p>

<p begin="00:07:34.087" end="00:07:34.788">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.788" end="00:07:37.824">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THEY DON&apos;T SAY YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON A BIBLE, AND </p>
<p begin="00:07:37.824" end="00:07:38.859">THEY DON&apos;T MENTION GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.859" end="00:07:39.626">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.626" end="00:07:44.431">BUT THE STATE LAWS IN ALL 13 STATES REQUIRED EVERY OATH TO BE DONE ON A BIBLE AND MENTION GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.431" end="00:07:46.867">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT ONLY THREE OF THEM WERE STILL THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.867" end="00:07:51.205">THAT LITMUS TEST WAS ONLY THERE WHEN THE BILL OF RIGHTS CAME INTO EFFECTED, ONLY THREE STATES </p>
<p begin="00:07:51.205" end="00:07:54.208">STILL HAD THOSE LAWS AND THE FOUNDERS HAD BEEN TRYING THE PHASE THAT OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.208" end="00:07:56.610">&gt;&gt; LET&apos;S TAKE THE RELIGION SIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.610" end="00:08:01.682">THE FIRST AMENDMENT SAYS &quot;CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW RESPECTING AND ESTABLISHMENT OF </p>
<p begin="00:08:01.682" end="00:08:05.452">RELIGION.&quot; ONE CASE IN THE U.S. SUPREME COURT WAS RABBILESSLY GUTTERMAN </p>
<p begin="00:08:05.452" end="00:08:09.790">WAS ASKED IF PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND TO, GIVE A PRAYER AT A GRADUATION, AND HE WASN&apos;T </p>

<p begin="00:08:10.457" end="00:08:13.861">NOW, TELL ME HOW CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW MEANS THAT A RABBI </p>
<p begin="00:08:13.861" end="00:08:18.498">CAN&apos;T SAY THE WORD &quot;GOD&quot; AT A PRAYERMENT THAT&apos;S A PRETTY STRANGE PARSING OF THE CONSTITUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.498" end="00:08:22.469">AND THAT&apos;S WHAT I ARGUE IS CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW AS A RESTRICTION ON CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.469" end="00:08:28.242">IT&apos;S NOT A RESTRICTION ON THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE TO SAY THE WORD &quot;GOD&quot; IN PUBLIC.</p>
