<p begin="00:04:57.130" end="00:04:59.366">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M NOT IN THE BETTING BUSINESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.366" end="00:05:01.401">&gt;&gt; OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.401" end="00:05:02.769">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS AWESOME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.769" end="00:05:09.142">A MORMON GAMBLING WITH AN EVANGELICAL OVER WHO IS THE BIGGER LIAR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.142" end="00:05:12.679">ARE THERE ANY COMMANDMENTS LEFT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.679" end="00:05:18.318">WITH MORE ON ROMNEY&apos;S $10,000 BET, WE TURN TO OUR SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT JOHN </p>

<p begin="00:05:24.458" end="00:05:27.895">WHY IS EVERYONE MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS $10,000 BET THING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.895" end="00:05:34.334">&gt;&gt; ONE, JON, BECAUSE IT FEEDS INTO THE PRE-EXISTING NARRATIVE ABOUT MITT ROMNEY </p>
<p begin="00:05:34.334" end="00:05:37.638">BEING AN OUT OF TOUCH MULTI-MILLIONAIRE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.638" end="00:05:44.511">WHEN ROMNEY RAN THE BUY-OUT FIRM, EVERYTHING ABOUT ROMNEY TELLS THE TALE OF A MAN WHO </p>
<p begin="00:05:44.511" end="00:05:48.482">JUST FIRED YOUR DAD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.482" end="00:05:50.284">THIS IS NOT A NARRATIVE, JON,</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.284" end="00:05:51.518">THAT THE PRESS INVENTED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.518" end="00:05:55.455">LOOK AT HIS THIRD GRADE CLASS PICTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.455" end="00:05:56.657">HIS HAIR IS EXACTLY THE SAME,</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.657" end="00:05:58.125">JON.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.125" end="00:06:01.695">WHAT SEVEN-YEAR-OLD HAS GRAYING TEMPLES?</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.695" end="00:06:03.297">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT ABOUT NEWT GINGRICH?</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.297" end="00:06:09.036">HE HAS A PERSONAL NET WORTH FROM LAST YEAR I THINK LIKE $6- $7 MILLION.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.036" end="00:06:12.139">A HALF A MILLION DOLLAR TAB AT TIFFANY&apos;S.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.139" end="00:06:13.907">&gt;&gt; MONEY ISN&apos;T GINGRICH&apos;S NARRATIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.907" end="00:06:16.376">IT&apos;S THE INFIDELITY GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.376" end="00:06:18.445">HIS PROBLEM IS OATHS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.445" end="00:06:20.614">HE CAN FLAUNT HIS WEALTH ALL HE LIKES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.614" end="00:06:27.221">WHAT HE CAN&apos;T DO IS PROMISE TO BE AMERICA&apos;S PRESIDENT FOR RICHER OR POORER AND </p>
<p begin="00:06:27.221" end="00:06:30.624">DEFINITELY NOT IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.624" end="00:06:35.429">WITHOUT EVOKING IMAGES OF PRESIDENT GINGRICH GETTING BORED OF US AND MESSING AROUND </p>
<p begin="00:06:35.429" end="00:06:38.131">WITH A YOUNGER COUNTRY BEHIND OUR BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.131" end="00:06:41.969">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO GINGRICH IS SAYING </p>
<p begin="00:06:41.969" end="00:06:43.470">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.470" end="00:06:50.377">EVERY CANDIDATE HAS AN ACHILLE&apos;S HEEL, THAT SPOT WHEN THEY WERE DIPPED INTO INDESTRUCT I </p>
<p begin="00:06:50.377" end="00:06:54.481">BELIEVE CAMPAIGN JUICE WAS LEFT UNCOVERED LEAVING THEM VULNERABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.481" end="00:06:59.686">&gt;&gt; Jon: I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY ACHILLY&apos;S MOM DIDN&apos;T DIP HIM </p>
<p begin="00:06:59.686" end="00:07:01.555">TWICE MAKING SURE SHE COVERED THE HEEL.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.555" end="00:07:03.490">&gt;&gt; YOU CAN&apos;T DOUBLE DIP, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.490" end="00:07:06.727">IT&apos;S RUDE TO THE PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE BEHIND YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.727" end="00:07:08.729">&gt;&gt; Jon: JUST ONE DIP AND A LITTLE LADLE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.729" end="00:07:10.030">I MEAN THE WHOLE THING IS DONE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.030" end="00:07:11.632">IT&apos;S NOT A SECOND DIP.</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.632" end="00:07:13.033">I&apos;M JUST SAYING....</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.033" end="00:07:14.234">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S TWO DIPS, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.234" end="00:07:16.470">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S AN EASY DIP.</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.470" end="00:07:20.707">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE BONKERS, PLEASE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.707" end="00:07:24.178">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT&apos;S RICK PERRY&apos;S ACHILLY&apos;S HEEL?</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.178" end="00:07:25.712">&gt;&gt; HE DOESN&apos;T HAVE ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.712" end="00:07:27.848">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU JUST SAID EVERY....</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.848" end="00:07:31.185">&gt;&gt; RICK PERRY HAS AN ACHILLE&apos;S HEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.185" end="00:07:35.455">&gt;&gt; THE IDEA THAT THIS PRESIDENT NOW WITH IRAN GETTING ONE OF OUR PREDATOR </p>
<p begin="00:07:35.455" end="00:07:41.428">DRONES IN THEIR POSSESSION AND HE HAD TWO OPPORTUNITIES OR HE DIDN&apos;T HAVE TWO OPPORTUNITIES,</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.428" end="00:07:48.635">HE HAD TWO CHOICES, ACTUALLY HE HAD THREE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.635" end="00:07:50.304">&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING, PERRY?</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.304" end="00:07:55.909">YOU KNOW THAT LISTING THINGS IN THREEs IS OFF LIMITS TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.909" end="00:07:57.845">NUMBER IN ANY FORM REALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.845" end="00:08:01.048">IF YOU HAVE TO LIST STUFF, DO IT WITH LETTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.048" end="00:08:03.550">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR NARRATIVE THEN?</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.550" end="00:08:04.585">&gt;&gt; YOU DON&apos;T, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.585" end="00:08:05.686">YOU EMBRACE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.686" end="00:08:08.021">UNFORTUNATELY ROMNEY IS NO GOOD AT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.021" end="00:08:13.360">&gt;&gt; THIS WAS AN OUTRAGEOUS NUMBER TO ANSWER, AN OUTRAGEOUS CHARGE FROM HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:16.029">IT&apos;S BEEN PROVEN WRONG TIME AND TIME AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.029" end="00:08:20.234">I SAID OKAY LET&apos;S PUT SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.234" end="00:08:23.170">IT&apos;S LIKE SAYING, HEY, I&apos;LL BET YOU A MILLION BUCKS.</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.170" end="00:08:25.873">&gt;&gt; EXCEPT HE DIDN&apos;T SAY A MILLION BUCKS, DID HE?</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.873" end="00:08:27.274">HE SAID $10,000.</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.274" end="00:08:32.179">IF HE HAD SAID A MILLION BUCKS HE STILL HAS 200 OF THOSE.</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.179" end="00:08:33.480">THERE&apos;S NO WAY AROUND THIS,</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.480" end="00:08:33.814">JON.</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.814" end="00:08:41.255">IF HE REALLY WANTS TO SHAKE RICK PERRY UP, HE HAS TO EMBRACE THE RICH DOUCHE WITHIN.</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.255" end="00:08:41.755">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW?</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.755" end="00:08:43.056">HOW DOES ONE DO THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.056" end="00:08:46.360">&gt;&gt; JUST LOOK RICK PERRY IN THE EYE AND SAY, &quot;HEY, RICK, YOU </p>
<p begin="00:08:46.360" end="00:08:48.061">KNOW WHAT I&apos;M GOING TO DO TO YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.061" end="00:08:54.134">I&apos;M GOING TO BUY UP ALL THE LAND AROUND YOUR FAMILY&apos;S HOUSE AND THEN BUILD FACTORIES </p>
<p begin="00:08:54.134" end="00:08:56.803">THAT LEAK ETHER INTO YOUR WATER SUPPLY.</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.803" end="00:08:58.839">SURE, THE EPA WILL FIGHT IT,</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.839" end="00:09:03.210">RICK, BUT I&apos;LL HIRE SO MANY LAWYERS THAT THEY&apos;LL BE FORCED TO GIVE UP THE CASE OR GO BANKRUPT.</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.210" end="00:09:08.115">AND THEN I&apos;LL WALK INTO YOUR POISONED HOUSE IN FRONT OF YOUR CHOKING FAMILY WHO CAN&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:09:08.115" end="00:09:13.287">GET UP TO HELP US BECAUSE THEIR GENES ARE NOW MUTATING,</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.287" end="00:09:17.691">THEIR LEGS CAN&apos;T SUPPORT THEIR WEIGHT AND I WILL STRANGLE YOU TO DEATH.</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.691" end="00:09:18.825">WHY WILL I DO THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.825" end="00:09:21.028">BECAUSE I&apos;M RICH, RICK.</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.028" end="00:09:34.908">AND THIS IS THE KIND OF (BEEP) THAT RICH PEOPLE CAN DO.&quot; ( APPLAUSE ) </p>
<p begin="00:09:34.908" end="00:09:37.277">&gt;&gt; Jon: EMBRACE IT?</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.245" end="00:09:43.083">AND THEN MITT ROMNEY&apos;S GOT TO LOOK STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA AND SAY TO THE AMERICAN </p>
<p begin="00:09:43.083" end="00:09:44.284">PEOPLE, &quot;VOTE FOR ME.</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.284" end="00:09:49.923">YOU HAVE NO (BEEP) IDEA WHAT I&apos;M CAPABLE OF.&quot; </p>
