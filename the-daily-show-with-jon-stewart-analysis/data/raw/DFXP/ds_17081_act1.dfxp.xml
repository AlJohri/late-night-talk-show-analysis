<p begin="00:08:17.664" end="00:08:19.333">&gt;&gt; YEAH, MAYBE.</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.333" end="00:08:23.570">&gt;&gt; BUT THE THRONGS OF TOURISTS WERE ALSO CONCERNED FOR HER SAFETY.</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.570" end="00:08:25.038">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M A LITTLE WORRIED.</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.038" end="00:08:26.940">I&apos;VE SEEN WHAT THEY DID, LIKE,</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.940" end="00:08:30.477">ESPECIALLY WHEN I SAW THE KATIE COURIC INTERVIEW BACK IN THE 2008 ELECTION.</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.477" end="00:08:34.181">&gt;&gt; THAT WAS WHEN THEY MADE HER LOOK LIKE A (BLEEP)ING IDIOT.</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.181" end="00:08:34.481">LAUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.481" end="00:08:38.418">&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO SAY THAT WAS NOT EVEN AN INTERVIEW, IT WAS AN AMBUSH.</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.418" end="00:08:41.321">&gt;&gt; IT WAS AN AMBUSH OF WORDS AND QUESTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.321" end="00:08:42.256">&gt;&gt; SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.256" end="00:08:48.595">&gt;&gt; SADLY, WHILE SARAH SUCCESSFULLY INFILTRATED, HER SUPPORTERS WERE KEPT OUT BY </p>
<p begin="00:08:48.595" end="00:08:54.201">NBC&apos;S LIBERAL THUGS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SHARE THEIR BEAUTIFUL VISION WITH THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.201" end="00:08:57.604">THIS IS THE BANNER THAT NBC WOULD NOT ALLOW ON TELEVISION.</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.604" end="00:09:04.645">THE POWERFUL IMAGE OF SARAH PALIN BEING KARATE CHOPPED BY RONALD REAGAN&apos;S GHOST.</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.645" end="00:09:12.186">&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY WHEN I CREATED THIS SHE WAS BEING SALUTED BY HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.186" end="00:09:15.656">&gt;&gt; SALUTED BY HIS GHOST, NOT KARATE CHOPPED?</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.656" end="00:09:17.791">THAT&apos;S MUCH MORE SENSIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.791" end="00:09:19.359">INFILTRATING THE TARGET IS ONE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.359" end="00:09:25.399">SHE NOW HAD TO EMBARK ON THE LONG JOURNEY BACK TO THE SAFETY OF HER BASE CAMP.</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.399" end="00:09:29.937">AFTERWARDS THE CONCERN IS HOW SARAH PALIN WILL GET FROM 30 ROCK BACK TO THE FOX NEWS BUILDING.</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.937" end="00:09:33.307">IT&apos;S A PERILOUS JOURNEY THAT MAY TAKE HER AS MUCH... ACTUALLY,</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.307" end="00:09:35.876">WE&apos;RE ALREADY... THAT&apos;S IT, IT&apos;S RIGHT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.876" end="00:09:37.744">HOLY (BLEEP) THAT&apos;S (BLEEP)ING CLOSE.</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.744" end="00:09:40.747">PALIN STRUCK A BLOW AGAINST THE ALL-POWERFUL LIBERAL MEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.747" end="00:09:43.784">BUT THE WAR WAS FAR FROM WON.</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.784" end="00:09:47.521">DO YOU THINK WE&apos;LL EVER SEE THE DAY WHERE THERE WILL BE A CONSERVATIVE MEDIA?</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.521" end="00:09:48.589">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.589" end="00:09:49.423">&gt;&gt; REALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.423" end="00:09:53.527">EVEN A DOMINEERING MEDIA ORGANIZATION LITERALLY A BLOCK AND A HALF FROM HERE?</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.527" end="00:09:54.061">&gt;&gt; NEVER.</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.061" end="00:09:55.662">&gt;&gt; IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN, WILL IT?</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.662" end="00:09:56.063">&gt;&gt; NEVER.</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.063" end="00:09:57.130">&gt;&gt; IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.130" end="00:10:03.770">&gt;&gt; BUT SARAH PALIN WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT-- ONE AWKWARD TORI SPELLING COOKING </p>
<p begin="00:10:03.770" end="00:10:07.708">SEGMENT AT A TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.708" end="00:10:08.709">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  </p>
