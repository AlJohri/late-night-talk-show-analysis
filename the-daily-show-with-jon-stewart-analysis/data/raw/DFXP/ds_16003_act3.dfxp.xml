<p begin="00:00:05.172" end="00:00:09.510">MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FOUNDER OF WIKIPEDIA, WHICH IS CELEBRATING ITS TENTH ANNIVERSARY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.510" end="00:00:17.918">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JIMMY WALES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.918" end="00:00:18.452">HOW ARE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.452" end="00:00:19.353">&gt;&gt; VERY GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.353" end="00:00:19.887">VERY GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.887" end="00:00:23.457">THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.457" end="00:00:25.492">&gt;&gt; Jon: HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO WIKIPEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.492" end="00:00:26.627">&gt;&gt; I KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.627" end="00:00:27.361">IT&apos;S AMAZING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.361" end="00:00:34.134">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID YOU HAVE A SENSE WHEN YOU THOUGHT THIS UP THAT IT WOULD BE... THAT IT WOULD BE </p>
<p begin="00:00:34.134" end="00:00:39.273">SOMETHING WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE IDEAS THAT COMES TO YOU IN A DREAM AND YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY </p>
<p begin="00:00:39.273" end="00:00:40.807">THIS IS SOMETHING?</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.807" end="00:00:46.680">&gt;&gt; WELL, I WAS ALWAYS VERY OPTIMISTICMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.680" end="00:00:54.555">I REMEMBER LOOKING AT THE LIST OF THE TOP 50 WEB SITES AND SAW A REFERENCE SITE IN THE TOP 50.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.555" end="00:00:57.257">WE&apos;RE NOW THE FIFTH MOST POPULAR WEB SITE IN THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.257" end="00:00:59.560">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DID YOU FIND THAT INFORMATION OUT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.560" end="00:01:01.728">&gt;&gt; I LOOKED IT UP ON WIKIPEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.728" end="00:01:02.829">&gt;&gt; Jon: INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.829" end="00:01:03.864">AND YOU BELIEVE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.864" end="00:01:06.300">&gt;&gt; I WROTE IT, JON, SO...</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.300" end="00:01:08.402">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU WROTE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.402" end="00:01:13.807">IT IS STRANGE TO LOOK UP WIKIPEDIA ON WIKIPEDIA BECAUSE THE ONE THING THAT IS NICE ABOUT </p>
<p begin="00:01:13.807" end="00:01:19.980">WIKIPEDIA, IT IS A STORY OF HISTORIES THAT INCLUDES THE GOOD AND THE BAD ALL IN THE SAME...</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.980" end="00:01:21.315">EVERYBODY GETS TO TAKE THEIR SHOT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.315" end="00:01:22.382">&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.382" end="00:01:28.388"> IF YOU REALLY WANT THE SEE THE WORST CRITICISM OF WIKIPEDIA, GO TO WIKIPEDIA AND LOOK UP THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:28.388" end="00:01:29.923">ARTICLE, CRITICISM OF WIKIPEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.923" end="00:01:36.330">WE DOCUMENT EVERYTHING BAD EVERYONE HAS EVER SAID ABOUT US IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.330" end="00:01:40.567">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S KIND OF COOL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.567" end="00:01:45.639">ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA, YOU HAD TO SCRIBBLE YOUR NOTES IN THE MARGINS AND DRAW LOTS OF PENISES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.639" end="00:01:47.407">&gt;&gt; AS ONE DOES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.407" end="00:01:52.779">&gt;&gt; Jon: HASN&apos;T BEEN AROUND IN A WHILE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.779" end="00:01:58.385">THE PROBLEM PEOPLE HAVE IS ACCURACY OR BIAS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.385" end="00:02:00.087">PEOPLE CAN GAME IT OR GOOF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.087" end="00:02:01.188">HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.188" end="00:02:05.425">&gt;&gt; THE MAIN THING IS THERE IS A CORE COMMUNITY THAT ARE REALLY PARK MATT PEOPLE ABOUT GETTING </p>
<p begin="00:02:05.425" end="00:02:06.126">IT RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.126" end="00:02:10.697">THEY&apos;RE REALLY THE FIRST DEFENSE AGAINST ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.697" end="00:02:14.168">WHEN WE SEE ACADEMIC STUDIES OF THE QUALITY OF WIKIPEDIA, WHICH </p>
<p begin="00:02:14.168" end="00:02:17.237">THERE HAVEN&apos;T BEEN ENOUGH OF, WE DO QUITE WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.237" end="00:02:20.474">IT&apos;S NOT PERFECT, BUT WE&apos;RE ALL LOOKING TO IMPROVE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.474" end="00:02:27.514">&gt;&gt; FOR INSTANCE, ON WIKIPEDIA YOU ARED AS THE CO-FOUNDER, BUT ARE YOU THE FOUNDER OR THE CO-FOUNDER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.514" end="00:02:29.783">&gt;&gt; WELL, SOURCES MAY VARY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.783" end="00:02:31.084">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT DO YOU SAY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.084" end="00:02:33.353">&gt;&gt; WELL, I SAY I&apos;M THE FOUNDER,</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.353" end="00:02:35.055">BUT I THINK IT&apos;S A SILLY DEBATE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.055" end="00:02:37.925">I DON&apos;T THINK IT&apos;S ALL THAT INTERESTING OR IMPORTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.925" end="00:02:41.295">I&apos;M A CENTRAL TIER, LIKE THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS WHO WRITE WIKIPEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.295" end="00:02:42.696">THAT&apos;S THE IMPORTANT THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.696" end="00:02:46.800">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU&apos;RE OKAY IF THEY CHANGE YOUR TIGHT FEDERAL FOUNDER TO VOLUNTEER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:48.168">&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE PERFECT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.168" end="00:02:49.503">LET&apos;S DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.503" end="00:02:51.004">&gt;&gt; Jon: HAVE AT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.004" end="00:02:52.272">&gt;&gt; THERE WE GO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.272" end="00:02:56.343">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS IMPRESSIVE THING IS TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT&apos;S FIFTH </p>
<p begin="00:02:56.343" end="00:03:00.547">MOST VISITED WEB SITE AND NOT FEEL THE URGE TO COMPLETELY MONETIZE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.547" end="00:03:02.883">HAS THAT... HAVE YOU FELT THAT URGE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.883" end="00:03:04.751">DO YOU LOOK AT FACEBOOK?</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.751" end="00:03:13.060">DO YOU SIT IN THE FACEBOOK MOVIE IN THE BACK WITH A BATTLE OF JACK GOING, I COULD BE THOSE PRICKS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.060" end="00:03:14.428">HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.428" end="00:03:20.701">&gt;&gt; NO, I MEAN, FOR US, FOR ME WIKIPEDIA IS SOMETHING THAT I HOPE IS REALLY IMPORTANT CULTURALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.701" end="00:03:22.769">WE&apos;RE A SPACE THAT&apos;S NOT COMMERCIAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.769" end="00:03:26.240">WE&apos;RE SPACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN LEARN, REFLECT, SHARE KNOWLEDGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.240" end="00:03:30.444">WE&apos;RE GLOBAL IN SCOPE, TRYING THE SHARE FREE INFORMATION WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:30.444" end="00:03:32.346">PLANET IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.346" end="00:03:37.050">I THINK IN 500 YEARS PEOPLE WILL LOOK BACK AND SAY, FACEBOOK?</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.050" end="00:03:37.851">WHAT WAS THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.851" end="00:03:40.120">BUT THEN THEY&apos;LL SAY, OH,</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.120" end="00:03:40.921">WIKIPEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.921" end="00:03:51.698">&gt;&gt; Jon: REALLY, BECAUSE I THINK IN 500 YEARS THEY&apos;LL SEE BEEP, BLARP, BLOP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.698" end="00:03:52.566">HUMANS CATCH ME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.566" end="00:03:56.503">IT&apos;S INTERESTING YOU BROUGHT UP THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT BECAUSE ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING </p>
<p begin="00:03:56.503" end="00:04:02.209">THINGS ABOUT WIKIPEDIA IS THAT IT ABIDES BY THE LAWS OF FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.209" end="00:04:07.814">I JUSTIFIED THAT TO BE SO INTERESTING THAT IT IS THIS OPEN SOURCE, NON-COMMERCIAL </p>
<p begin="00:04:07.814" end="00:04:13.687">INTERNATIONAL PHENOMENON THAT ABIDES THE RULES OF FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.687" end="00:04:16.623">MAYBE OUR NATION&apos;S SILLIEST STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.623" end="00:04:17.824">&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.824" end="00:04:22.095">I REMEMBER VERY EARLY ON SOME VOLUNTEERS FROM EUROPE SAID,</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.095" end="00:04:27.601">WELL, WHAT ARE THE LAWS IN FLORIDA RELATING TO NUDITY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.601" end="00:04:31.672">AND I SAID, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, IT&apos;S MANDATORY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.672" end="00:04:37.778">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW IS IT THAT THEY HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THIS INTERNATIONAL PHENOMENON?</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.778" end="00:04:40.981">&gt;&gt; WELL, IT&apos;S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.981" end="00:04:44.651">&gt;&gt; Jon: I ASSUME MOST THINGS ARE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THATMENT </p>
<p begin="00:04:44.651" end="00:04:50.123">&gt;&gt; OUR SERVES, THE PRIMARY SERVER FARM IS IN FLORIDA FOR HISTORICAL REASONS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.123" end="00:04:53.360">WHEN WIKIPEDIA STARTED GETTING REALLY BIG, I WAS IN FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:58.432">I WENT AND PHYSICALLY INSTALLED SERVERS OVER RACKS AT THE DATA CENTER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.432" end="00:05:01.935">WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF SERVERS THERE IN FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.935" end="00:05:06.807">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE MAJORITY OF THE PAID WIKIPEDIA EMPLOYEES, ARE THEY SERVER GUYS THAT TAKE CARE </p>
<p begin="00:05:06.807" end="00:05:08.108">OF YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.108" end="00:05:11.411">&gt;&gt; WELL, IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE PROGRAMMERS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.411" end="00:05:17.417">WE HAVE SOME USUAL NON-PROFIT FUNCTIONS, ACCOUNTING, LEGAL,</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.417" end="00:05:17.784">FINANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.784" end="00:05:19.953">SOMEBODY ANSWERS THE PHONES,</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.953" end="00:05:21.822">THOSE KIND OF THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.822" end="00:05:24.491">HOW QUICKLY DO THOSE THINGS CHANGE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.491" end="00:05:30.197"> IF I WERE GOING TO GO ON THERE TONIGHT AND WRITE THAT I AM, I DON&apos;T KNOW, WATTMAN, HOW LONG </p>
<p begin="00:05:30.197" end="00:05:36.503">WOULD I LEGITIMATELY BE BATMAN?</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.503" end="00:05:41.175">&gt;&gt; WELL, LET&apos;S SAY RIGHT NOW AN ADMINISTRATOR IS CLICKING </p>
<p begin="00:05:41.175" end="00:05:43.277">PROTECT ON YOUR ARTICLE TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN&apos;T HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.277" end="00:05:48.782">SO GENERALLY IF YOU GO AND CHANGE WIKIPEDIA, IT WILL BE CHANGED BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.782" end="00:05:54.521">SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.521" end="00:05:58.158">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT WHAT... DO YOU KNOW I&apos;M NOT BATMAN?</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.158" end="00:06:00.394">&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE A RELIABLE SOURCE IN </p>
<p begin="00:06:00.394" end="00:06:01.895">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT I&apos;M BATMAN?</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.895" end="00:06:03.330">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S ALL I NEED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.330" end="00:06:05.566">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, I&apos;M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.566" end="00:06:08.769">I THINK I&apos;VE JUST FOUND YOUR ACHILLES HEEL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.769" end="00:06:12.539">MY SUPERHERO WORKS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.539" end="00:06:13.240">CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.240" end="00:06:15.342">THIS IS WHAT IT&apos;S GOING TO BE NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.342" end="00:06:19.146">IT&apos;S NON-COMMERCIAL, OPEN SOURCE, AND YOU&apos;LL KEEP IT THAT WAY, THE PURITY OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.146" end="00:06:20.714">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE A CHARITY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.714" end="00:06:26.253">WE EXIST FROM DONATIONS FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AND WE&apos;RE REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.253" end="00:06:26.987">&gt;&gt; Jon: WOW.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.987" end="00:06:30.891">SO NICE TO MEET A VOLUNTEER SUCH AS YOURSELF WORKING ON IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.891" end="00:06:32.226">JIMMY WALES, THANK YOU SO MUCH </p>
