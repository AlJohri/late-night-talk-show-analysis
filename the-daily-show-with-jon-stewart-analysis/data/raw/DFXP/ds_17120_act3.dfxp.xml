<p begin="00:02:40.394" end="00:02:43.163">AND THE OTHER SHOWS TO DO THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.163" end="00:02:48.101">IT WAS AN ANIMATED SERIES IDEA THAT I CAME UP WITH A WHILE BACK AND PUT IT ON HOLD FOR A NUMBER </p>
<p begin="00:02:48.101" end="00:02:53.307">OF REASONS AND WHEN IT CAME TIME TO DO A MOVIE THIS SEEMED LIKE A FUN PROJECT AND GUYS LIKE JAMES </p>
<p begin="00:02:53.307" end="00:02:57.444">CAMERON AND PETER JACKSON HAVE PERFECTED THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR...</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.444" end="00:03:00.581">TO DO THESE INCREDIBLY LIFE LIKE CHARACTERS.</p>

<p begin="00:03:06.787" end="00:03:11.425">ONE HAS USED THE TECHNOLOGY FOR COMEDY AND I THOUGHT, WELL, GOD,</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.425" end="00:03:12.059">WHERE ELSE...</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.059" end="00:03:15.963">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO ONE&apos;S USED IT FOR A BEAR HAVING SEX WITH HOOKERS YET.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.963" end="00:03:17.197">&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT, TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.197" end="00:03:19.066">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:03:19.066" end="00:03:23.270">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DO YOU... SO YOU CALL UP MARK WAHLBERG AND SAY,</p>

<p begin="00:03:35.082" end="00:03:38.819">&gt;&gt; Jon: DOES HE... DOES HE CALL YOU BACK AND GO &quot;I&apos;VE READ </p>
<p begin="00:03:38.819" end="00:03:40.921">THIS, IT SPEAKS TO ME&quot;?</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.921" end="00:03:43.557">(LAUGHTER) WHAT DOES HE SAY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.557" end="00:03:46.460">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE SOUNDS THAT MUCH LIKE CLINT EASTWOOD ON THE PHONE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.460" end="00:03:48.829">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHS)  </p>
<p begin="00:03:48.829" end="00:03:50.097">&gt;&gt; HE WAS INTO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.097" end="00:03:56.103">I THINK... HE CLAIMS HE CAME INTO IT WITH TREPIDATION AND THAT HE WAS, FOR BETTER OR </p>
<p begin="00:03:56.103" end="00:03:58.872">WORSE, TRUSTING ME AND IT PAID OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.872" end="00:04:01.241">IF IT DIDN&apos;T, I PROBABLY WOULDN&apos;T BE HERE RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.241" end="00:04:04.044">I&apos;D PROBABLY BE BLOODIED AND BEAT ON THE A PULP.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.044" end="00:04:06.380">NO, HE&apos;S A PEACEFUL GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.380" end="00:04:08.282">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THIS GUY, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.282" end="00:04:09.516">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.516" end="00:04:11.118">THIS IS THE GUY YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.118" end="00:04:16.123">&gt;&gt; Jon: THERE IS NO REASON THAT I AS A GROWN MAN APPROACHING VERY RAPIDLY 50 </p>
<p begin="00:04:16.123" end="00:04:22.930">YEARS ON THIS EARTH SHOULD WATCH MARK WAHLBERG HAVE A FISTFIGHT WITH A TEDDY BEAR AND LAUGH HELPLESSLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.930" end="00:04:25.332">AND YET THAT&apos;S WHAT I FOUND MYSELF DOING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.332" end="00:04:31.972">I FOUND MYSELF JUST RERACKING AND WATCHING OVER AND OVER OF THEM HAVING A FISTFIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.972" end="00:04:35.342">&gt;&gt; THE GOAL FOR THAT SCENE WAS TO PLAY IT AS REALISTICALLY AS </p>
<p begin="00:04:35.342" end="00:04:44.084">IF YOU WERE WATCHING &quot;THE BOURNE IDENTITY.&quot; (LAUGHTER) WE SAID... WE TALKED TO MARK,</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.084" end="00:04:49.189">THE STUNT GUYS, WE SAID THIS HAS GOT TO BE VERY SERIOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.189" end="00:04:51.191">AND WAHLBERG PULLED IT OFF.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:04:51.191" end="00:04:56.230">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU GO IN AND YOU&apos;RE LIKE &quot;MARK, THIS BEAR KILLED YOUR FAMILY.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:04:56.230" end="00:04:56.630">(LAUGHTER) </p>

<p begin="00:05:18.085" end="00:05:21.054">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M USED TO WORKING WITH CHARACTERS WHO WON&apos;T GET DRUNK </p>
<p begin="00:05:21.054" end="00:05:24.791">AND GO OFF ON RANTS ABOUT THE JEWS, YES.</p>
