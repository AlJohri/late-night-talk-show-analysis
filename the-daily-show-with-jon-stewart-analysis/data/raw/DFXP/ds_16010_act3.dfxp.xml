<p begin="00:01:38.131" end="00:01:39.600">YOU WERE MOST ENTICED BY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:41.401">&gt;&gt; I LIKE THE ONE WE LEAD OFF WITH.</p>

<p begin="00:01:46.406" end="00:01:47.941">CAN YOU DO IT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.941" end="00:01:53.480">THERE&apos;S STUFF THAT OTHERS DON&apos;T REALLY THINK ABOUT LIKE... FIRST YOU HAVE TO WAIT </p>
<p begin="00:01:53.480" end="00:01:57.718">FOR EARTH AND MARS TO LINE UP SO YOU CAN GET THERE EFFICIENTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.718" end="00:02:01.588">AND THEN YOU HAVE TO AIM FOR WHERE MARS WILL BE WHEN YOU GET THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.588" end="00:02:02.523">THAT&apos;S KIND OF INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.523" end="00:02:06.460">&gt;&gt; Jon: IF YOU WANT TO GO TO MARS, ISN&apos;T THAT HOW WE WENT TO THE MOON.</p>

<p begin="00:02:08.695" end="00:02:11.131">&gt;&gt; FOR THE MOON YOU COULD COME BACK WHENEVER NEEDED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.131" end="00:02:17.004">WHEN YOU GET TO MARS, STUFF IS OUT OF ALIGNMENTS, YOU HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR-AND-A-HALF </p>
<p begin="00:02:17.004" end="00:02:19.006">BEFORE YOU CAN LAUNCH A TRIP BACK TO EARTH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.006" end="00:02:22.476">&gt;&gt; Jon: IF YOU GO TO MARS AND YOU GET THERE, YOU HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR-AND-A-HALF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.476" end="00:02:24.378">&gt;&gt; AT LEAST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.378" end="00:02:28.882">FOR THE EARTH AND MARS TO REALIGN TO THEN MAKE THE TRIP BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.882" end="00:02:33.220">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY DON&apos;T THEY GIVE THE ROCKET A STEERING WHEEL?</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.220" end="00:02:37.357">WHY DON&apos;T THEY USE....</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.357" end="00:02:42.229">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S IT TAKES HUGELY MORE ENERGY IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK ON A WHIM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.229" end="00:02:45.966">WE&apos;RE TRYING TO MAKE THE EFFICIENT PATHS AS EFFICIENT AS THEY CAN BE.</p>

<p begin="00:03:07.955" end="00:03:08.422">REALIGNED AGAIN?</p>
