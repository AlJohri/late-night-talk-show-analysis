<p begin="00:04:29.903" end="00:04:32.105">&gt;&gt; THE COMPANY HAS SET UP A HOT LINE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.105" end="00:04:36.777">IN THIS PLACE EMPLOYEES CAN WORK OUT THEIR FRUSTRATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.777" end="00:04:45.853">THEY&apos;VE EVEN INSTALLED NETS AROUND BUILDINGS TO TRY AND CATCH JUMPERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.853" end="00:04:52.326">&gt;&gt; Jon: IN WESTERN MEDICINE WE CALL THAT TREATING THE SYMPTOMS.</p>

<p begin="00:05:56.690" end="00:05:57.991">&gt;&gt; CHECKING, CHECKING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.991" end="00:06:02.029">WELL, AN I-POD WOULD COST 23% MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.029" end="00:06:03.363">&gt;&gt; Jon: WOW.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.363" end="00:06:09.369">I WOULD EXPECT IF WE WERE WORKING PEOPLE TO DEATH WE&apos;D BE GETTING LIKE 30-35% SAVINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.369" end="00:06:11.271">&gt;&gt; I&apos;LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.</p>
