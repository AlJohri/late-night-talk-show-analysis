<p begin="00:00:04.371" end="00:00:09.343">AS WE ALL NOW KNOW, JUST YESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCED AT THE NBC FALL SCHEDULE </p>
<p begin="00:00:09.343" end="00:00:12.112">UNVEILING THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SEEKING THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.112" end="00:00:20.220">HIS ANNOUNCEMENTS FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT AMANDA PEET WILL BE GOING TO SERIES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:21.088">BOTH IMPORTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.088" end="00:00:26.126">LUCKILY TRUMP DID NOT ALLOW THE OBJECTIVE REALITY OF HIS FAILED PRESIDENTIAL RUN TO DAMPEN HIS </p>
<p begin="00:00:26.126" end="00:00:27.027">IMAGINARY PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.027" end="00:00:30.230">&gt;&gt; THIS DECISION DOES NOT COME EASILY WITHOUT REGRET,</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.230" end="00:00:35.969">ESPECIALLY WHEN MY POTENTIAL CANDIDACY CONTINUES TO BE VALIDATED BY THE RANKING AT THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:35.969" end="00:00:38.639">TOP OF THE REPUBLICAN CONTENDERS IN POLLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.639" end="00:00:43.810">I MAINTAIN THE STRONG CONVICTION THAT IF I WERE TO RUN, I WOULD BE ABLE TO WIN THE PRIMARY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.810" end="00:00:45.445">I LOVE THIS GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.445" end="00:00:47.614">AND ULTIMATELY THE GENERAL ELECTION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.614" end="00:00:52.686">&gt;&gt; Jon: I VERY EASILY COULD HAVE BECOME THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD, RESTORED AMERICA&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:00:52.686" end="00:00:54.888">STATUS ABROAD AND SUCH AND SUCH,</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.888" end="00:01:04.264">BUT I REALIZED I CAN DO FOR MORE GOOD AND MANKIND BUILDING UPSCALE GOLF COURSES AND </p>
<p begin="00:01:04.264" end="00:01:09.269">CONDOMINIUMS IN THE GREATER TRI-STATE AREA AS WELL AS KEEPING MEATLOAF ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.269" end="00:01:13.173">MR. TRUMP, I CAN&apos;T HELP BUT THINK YOU LEFT THE RACE TOO SOON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.173" end="00:01:16.410">YOU RAISED SO MANY QUESTIONS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.410" end="00:01:19.079">LIKE WHAT DID YOUR CRACK TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS FIND IN HAWAII?</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.079" end="00:01:21.915">&gt;&gt; I HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN STUDYING IT, AND THEY CANNOT </p>
<p begin="00:01:21.915" end="00:01:22.916">BELIEVE WHAT THEY&apos;RE FINDING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.916" end="00:01:25.152">&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE PEOPLE DOWN THERE IN HAWAII SEARCHING?</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.152" end="00:01:25.853">&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.853" end="00:01:27.855">THEY CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY&apos;RE FINDING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.855" end="00:01:30.224">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU NEVER TOLD US.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.224" end="00:01:30.624">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.624" end="00:01:32.125">WILL WE BELIEVE IT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.125" end="00:01:33.894">WAS IT AN AMULET?</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.894" end="00:01:38.232">A CURSED AM YOU LET THAT MAKES THE WEARER BELIEVE HE HAS INFORMATION THAT DOESN&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:01:38.232" end="00:01:40.667">ACTUALLY EXIST?</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.667" end="00:01:41.101">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.101" end="00:01:44.371">IT&apos;S NOT JUST THE COUNTRY THAT YOU&apos;RE LETTING DOWN, IT&apos;S YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.371" end="00:01:47.174">YOU&apos;RE LETTING DONALD TRUMP DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.174" end="00:01:57.484">YOU KNOW, A GREAT MAN ONCE SAID WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR SHE WOULD RATHER WALK AWAY FROM HER </p>
<p begin="00:01:57.484" end="00:02:02.856">SUPPORT ROLE AS THEY TRIED TO CREATE A SAY DOG SHAMPOOING BUSINESS THAT SHE WOULD RATHER </p>
<p begin="00:02:02.856" end="00:02:06.360">WALK AWAY THAN CONTINUE TO WATTLE THE TERRIBLE PERSON THAT IS STAR JONES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.360" end="00:02:07.427">&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULDN&apos;T QUIT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.427" end="00:02:12.900">IF YOU QUIT, IT&apos;S GOING TO FOLLOW YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:15.068">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE SAYING TO WALK AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.068" end="00:02:16.069">&gt;&gt; YOU WENT THIS FAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.069" end="00:02:17.471">FOR YOU TO QUIT IS STUPID.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.471" end="00:02:21.175">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE FIRED AND YOU&apos;RE A QUITTER AND STAR JONES KICKED </p>
<p begin="00:02:21.175" end="00:02:24.678">YOUR ASS WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.678" end="00:02:27.748">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.748" end="00:02:32.286">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, DONALD, IT APPEARS THE NANNY LEAKER HAS BECOME THE NANNY LEAKY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.286" end="00:02:33.220">YOU QUIT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.220" end="00:02:38.659">YOU HAD US ALL CONVINCED YOU WOULD TAKE OIL FROM LIBYA AND IRAQ AND MAKE THE CHINESE SUCK </p>
<p begin="00:02:38.659" end="00:02:40.427">YOUR GIANT GOLD BALLS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.427" end="00:02:46.099">TURNS OUT YOU JUST HAVE ALUMINUM FOIL PAINTED GOLD BALLS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.099" end="00:02:47.701">PROBABLY CHOCOLATE INSIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.701" end="00:02:50.437">HIGH QUALITY CHOCOLATE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.437" end="00:03:02.082">THEY&apos;RE MORE LIKE FERRER0 ROCCHER BALLS WITH A LITTLE HAZELNUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.082" end="00:03:03.083">DON&apos;T QUIT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.083" end="00:03:07.221">LOOK, DONALD, WE WENT IN WAY OVER OUR HEADS BANKING ON YOUR RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.221" end="00:03:10.290">WE SPENT $450 MILLION WE DON&apos;T HAVE BUILD &quot;THE DAILY </p>

<p begin="00:03:15.529" end="00:03:22.369">WE WERE JUST A WEEK AWAY FROM COMPLETING THE PROJECT WITH ITS FINAL TOUCHES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.369" end="00:03:26.306">THAT&apos;S REALITY BETTEN GOLDEN ALPACA FUR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.306" end="00:03:29.810">WE HAD A WHOLE TEAM SWEEP IT UP LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.810" end="00:03:32.513">I WAITED MY WHOLE LIFE FAR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LIKE YOU,</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.513" end="00:03:37.851">A MIX OF ARROGANCE WITH LACK OF FILTER AND EASILY EXPLOITABLE PHYSICAL TRAITS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.851" end="00:03:38.252">SERIOUSLY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.252" end="00:03:39.453">LOOK AT YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.453" end="00:03:44.391">YOU LOOK LIKE THE OFFSPRING OF IF LOU DOBBS AND JIM CRAMER </p>
<p begin="00:03:44.391" end="00:03:49.429">[BLEEPED] A MUPPET.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.429" end="00:03:53.233">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.233" end="00:03:54.801">NO ONE WANTED YOU TO BE PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.801" end="00:03:56.870">WE JUST WANTED TO WATCH YOU RUN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.870" end="00:03:58.605">BUT IF YOU WON&apos;T LISTEN TO ME,</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.605" end="00:04:02.409">PERHAPS YOU&apos;LL LISTEN TO THIS LITTLE BOY I FOUND BREATHING STEAM IN FRONT OF THE DINER EACH </p>
