<p begin="00:00:12.045" end="00:00:16.750">A THING CALLED THE SOUTHERN STRATEGY, AN APPEAL TO RACIAL FEARS TO TURN THE SOUTH AWAY </p>
<p begin="00:00:16.750" end="00:00:21.722">FROM DEMOCRATS THUS MAKING UP FOR NIXON&apos;S LACK OF CHARM AND CHARISMA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.722" end="00:00:25.826">EVERY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE HAS NEEDED A STRATEGY TO WIN THE SOUTH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.826" end="00:00:30.464">WITH THE PRIMARIES TOMORROW IN ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI WE&apos;RE GOING TO CHECK IN WITH MITT </p>

<p begin="00:00:34.334" end="00:00:44.077">GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.077" end="00:00:47.014">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DIDN&apos;T HAVE TO DO THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.014" end="00:00:50.751">&gt;&gt; I GOT STARTED RIGHT WITH A BISCUIT AND SOME CHEESY GRITS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.751" end="00:00:55.756">DELICIOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.756" end="00:01:00.260">&gt;&gt; Jon: A GUY THAT LOOKS LIKE HE JUST STEPPED OFF THE MONOPOLY BOARD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.260" end="00:01:05.065">DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU&apos;RE GOING TO APPEAL TO SOUTHERNERS BY FINDING REFERENCE WITH THEM </p>
<p begin="00:01:05.065" end="00:01:12.840">ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST TO THEM: THEIR ACCENT AND CHOOSING THE RIGHT BREAKFAST STARCH?</p>

<p begin="00:01:18.445" end="00:01:23.083">IS THERE ANYTHING MORE PATHETIC SOUTHERN FRIED PANDERING THAN GRITS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.083" end="00:01:27.387">&gt;&gt; THIS PLACE ALWAYS HAS A SPECIAL FEELING IN MY HEART BECAUSE WHEN I GREW UP I WAS </p>
<p begin="00:01:27.387" end="00:01:28.555">THINKING ABOUT DAVEY CROCKETT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.555" end="00:01:31.859">REMEMBER THE SONG BORN ON A MOUNTAIN TOP IN TENNESSEE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.859" end="00:01:33.560">GREENEST STATE IN THE LAND OF THE FREE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.560" end="00:01:35.462">RAISED IN THE WOODS SO HE KNEW EVERY TREE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.462" end="00:01:38.599">AND HE KILLED HIMSELF A BEAR WHEN HE WAS ONLY THREE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.599" end="00:01:39.499">DAVEY, DAVEY CROCKETT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.499" end="00:01:43.270">REMEMBER THAT?</p>

<p begin="00:01:45.973" end="00:01:48.542">THEY&apos;RE NOT 60.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.542" end="00:01:55.716">YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY DID NAIL DOWN THE PEOPLE WHO GREW UP WITH BLACK AND WHITE TV VOTE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.716" end="00:01:59.486">FORTUNATELY ROMNEY HAD A CHANCE TO USE A SLIGHTLY MORE RECENT SOUTHERN SONG REFERENCE </p>
<p begin="00:01:59.486" end="00:02:04.625">AT A RALLY LAST FRIDAY WITH RANDY OWEN, LEAD SINGER OF THE LEGENDARY COUNTRY BAND ALABAMA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.625" end="00:02:09.963">THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHICH GREATEST ALABAMA HIT IS MITT GOING TO ASK HIM TO SING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.963" end="00:02:11.231">FEELS SO RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.231" end="00:02:14.902">I KNOW WE HAD TO LOOK UP OTHER SONGS ON WIKIPEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.902" end="00:02:15.369">WHICH ONE.</p>
