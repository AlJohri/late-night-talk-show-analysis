<p begin="00:00:13.780" end="00:00:16.250">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM CRAIG SHIRLEY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.250" end="00:00:23.924">SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.924" end="00:00:26.026">NICE TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.026" end="00:00:27.728">&gt;&gt; YOU BET, THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.728" end="00:00:30.764">&gt;&gt; DECEMBER 1941, 31 DAYS,</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.764" end="00:00:32.466">HERE IS WHAT I LIKE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.466" end="00:00:35.102">I LOVE HISTORICAL NONFICTION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.102" end="00:00:39.273">I READ IT IN THE BATH-- WHERE I AM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.273" end="00:00:39.940">-- I AM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.940" end="00:00:43.844">BUT TYPICALLY IT&apos;S WRITTEN FROM SORT OF A DISTANT PERSPECTIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.844" end="00:00:46.747">YOU WENT THROUGH NEWSPAPERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.747" end="00:00:47.114">&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.114" end="00:00:47.714">&gt;&gt; MAGAZINES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.714" end="00:00:52.186">&gt;&gt; AND MAGAZINES AND THINGS AND IT GIVES IT AN IMMEDIATESY THAT I THINK IS </p>
<p begin="00:00:52.186" end="00:00:54.555">DIFFICULT TO FIND IN THESE TYPES OF THINGS WHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.555" end="00:00:55.589">DID THAT COME FROM?</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.589" end="00:01:00.360">&gt;&gt; WELL, I GREW UP IN A FAMILY, THE POINT OF REFERENCE GROWING UP AS A </p>
<p begin="00:01:00.360" end="00:01:02.796">CHILD WAS THE WAR, BEFORE THE WAR, DURING THE WAR,</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.796" end="00:01:06.567">AFTER THE WAR AND I HAVE AN UNG WOHL WAS KILLED IN WORLD WAR II AND MY GRANDFATHER </p>
<p begin="00:01:06.567" end="00:01:10.404">WAS A CIVIL DEFENSE CAPTAIN IN WORLD WAR II AND MY PARENTS DID SCRAP DRIVES AND </p>
<p begin="00:01:10.404" end="00:01:13.440">BOTH MY GRANDMOTHERS WERE ROSSIE THE RIVETERS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.440" end="00:01:15.843">ONE INSPECTED BOMBS, ANOTHER TESTED MACHINE GUNS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.843" end="00:01:20.681">SO GROWING UP IN THIS HOUSEHOLD I HEARD ABOUT ALL THE EXPLOITS AT THEIR LEVEL </p>
<p begin="00:01:20.681" end="00:01:24.084">FROM THE CITIZEN LEVEL SOICHLT WANTED TO WRITE A BOOK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.084" end="00:01:29.189">NOT FROM FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT OR CHURCH HILL&apos;S PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF </p>
<p begin="00:01:29.189" end="00:01:29.923">OUR PARENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.923" end="00:01:31.225">&gt;&gt; AND GRANDPARENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.225" end="00:01:36.096">&gt;&gt; THE INTERESTING THING THAT IS THE SENSE TRULY THE SENSE OF SURPRISE, YOU KNOW </p>
<p begin="00:01:36.096" end="00:01:38.432">THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY A SURPRISE ATTACK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.432" end="00:01:38.799">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.799" end="00:01:40.801">&gt;&gt; BUT AT GOVERNMENT LEVEL,</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.801" end="00:01:42.769">OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WAS IN THE WIND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.769" end="00:01:44.204">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.204" end="00:01:48.575">&gt;&gt; FDR WE FOUND, MY SON FOUND A MEMO IN THE LIBRARY,</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.575" end="00:01:54.748">THE PRESIDENT HAD GOTTEN ON DECEMBER 4th, 1941, 26 PAGE MEMO WHICH OUTLINED IN GREAT </p>
<p begin="00:01:54.748" end="00:02:00.287">DETAIL JAPANESE ES MEANAGE ACTIVITIES IN AMERICA AND IN THE HAWAIIAN TERRITORY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.287" end="00:02:06.426">AND ON PAGE FOUR IT SAID VERY EXPLICITLY THAT THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY FOR JAPANESE MILITARY ACTION </p>
<p begin="00:02:06.426" end="00:02:15.335">AGAINST EITHER THE WEST COAST, PAN AMA CANAL OR HAWAII ISLANDS SOCKS WE KNEW IT WAS IN THE WIND.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.335" end="00:02:20.073">THE JAPANESE HAD BECOME MILL TARRISTIC, QUIT THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS, INVADE </p>
<p begin="00:02:20.073" end="00:02:24.845">MANCHURIAN, PUT TROOPS INTO INDOCHINA AND THEY EXPANDED THEIR MILITARY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.845" end="00:02:29.149">SO THAT IS WHY WE WERE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THEM TO GET THEM OUT OF CHINA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.149" end="00:02:32.119">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE FASCINATING PART IS THAT YOU MADE YOUR SON DO ALL THAT RESEARCH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.119" end="00:02:32.819">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:32.819" end="00:02:35.556">&gt;&gt; FOR THREE REASONS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.556" end="00:02:39.927">FIRSTLY, HE IS A NAVY BRAT AND HE LOVES HISTORY AND HE CAME VERY CHEAP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.927" end="00:02:42.629">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO IT WASN&apos;T LIKE ARE YOU BEING PUNISHED,</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.629" end="00:02:45.098">YOUNG MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.098" end="00:02:47.201">&gt;&gt; YEAH, REALLY INTERESTING,</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.201" end="00:02:55.876">I DID NOT REALIZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS COUNTRY PUT THE JAPANESE CITIZENS </p>
<p begin="00:02:55.876" end="00:03:00.113">THROUGH THE HELL THAT THEY PUT THEM THROUGH THAT YOU COULD BE ARRESTED, NOT JUST </p>
<p begin="00:03:00.113" end="00:03:03.050">WEST COAST DEPUTIES, IF YOU HAD A CAMERA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.050" end="00:03:03.450">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.450" end="00:03:03.784">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.784" end="00:03:08.856">&gt;&gt; YOU HAD TO TURN IN, AFTER DECEMBER 7th THE ATTORNEY GENERAL&apos;S OFFICE </p>
<p begin="00:03:08.856" end="00:03:14.361">FRANCIS-- ORDERED ALL JAPANESE AMERICANS TO SURRENDER THEIR CAMERAS AND ANY RECORDING DEVICES THEY </p>
<p begin="00:03:14.361" end="00:03:15.662">TO THE LOCAL POLICE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.662" end="00:03:20.868">STARTING THE AFTERNOON ON DECEMBER 7th THERE WERE JAPANESE NATIONALS IN WASHINGTON WHO WERE PICKED </p>
<p begin="00:03:20.868" end="00:03:22.836">UP BY THE FBI.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.836" end="00:03:28.075">FRANCIS BIDDLE IS REALLY AN UNSUNG HERO OF WORLD WAR II BECAUSE J. EDGAR HOOVER AND </p>
<p begin="00:03:28.075" end="00:03:31.411">THE ARMY WANTED TO INCARCERATE EVERY JAPANESE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.411" end="00:03:33.447">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND GERMANS AND ITALIANS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.447" end="00:03:34.815">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.815" end="00:03:38.552">AND BITTLE WENT TO THE PRESIDENT AND SAID THIS IS EXCESSIVE, MR. PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.552" end="00:03:43.323">LET&apos;S JUST INCARCERATE THE ONES THAT ARE ON OUR WATCH LIST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.323" end="00:03:45.092">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS EXCESSIVE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.092" end="00:03:46.894">LET&apos;S JUST GET LIKE 20,000 OF THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.894" end="00:03:49.096">&gt;&gt; IT IS MORE ABOUT 140,000,</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.096" end="00:03:52.499">RIGHT, RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.499" end="00:03:58.338">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU KNOW, THE INCREDIBLE THING IS ALSO YOU KNOW WE DIDN&apos;T IMMEDIATELY </p>
<p begin="00:03:58.338" end="00:04:02.376">GO AFTER JAPAN IN THE MANNER THAT YOU MIGHT THINK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.376" end="00:04:02.709">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.709" end="00:04:04.811">&gt;&gt; Jon: OF THE COUNTRY THAT HAD ATTACKED US.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.811" end="00:04:09.917">&gt;&gt; I DIDN&apos;T REALIZE HOW-- I DON&apos;T WANT TO SAY SLOW BUT HOW OUR RESPONSE WAS MORE </p>
<p begin="00:04:09.917" end="00:04:13.320">DIRECTED TOWARDS GERMANY AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.320" end="00:04:15.055">FDR WAS UNDER, OF COURSE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.055" end="00:04:17.124">THE JAPANESE ATTACKED US ON THE 7th.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.124" end="00:04:19.159">WE DECLARE A WAR ON THE 8th.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.159" end="00:04:20.194">&gt;&gt; Jon: ONLY TO JAPAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.194" end="00:04:20.861">&gt;&gt; ONLY JAPAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.861" end="00:04:24.765">SO WE&apos;RE COMPLETELY FOCUSED ON WAR WITH JAPAN IN THE PAS CIVIC.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.765" end="00:04:29.369">BUT THERE IS NO CALL IN THIS COUNTRY WHATSOEVER TO GO TO WAR WITH GERMANY AND ITALY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.369" end="00:04:34.208">ONLY AFTER ON DECEMBER 11th WHEN THEY DECLARE A WAR ON US DO WE RELUCTANTLY SAY </p>
<p begin="00:04:34.208" end="00:04:40.347">OKAY, WE HAVE TO RESPOND IN KIND SO FDR ASKED THE CONGRESS FOR A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST JAPAN,</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.347" end="00:04:41.381">GERMANY AND ITALY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.381" end="00:04:46.153">BUT WE WERE SO MILITARILY WEAK IN THE PAS CIVIC, AND THERE WAS SO MUCH PRESSURE </p>
<p begin="00:04:46.153" end="00:04:52.092">THAT CHURCHILL WAS PUTTING ON ROOSEVELT TO CONCENTRATE OUR RESOURCES IN EUROPE, SO </p>
<p begin="00:04:52.092" end="00:04:54.695">REALLY IT WAS A GREAT DEBATE IN THIS COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.695" end="00:04:56.096">WHAT GOES FIRST, THE PAS CIVIC OR ATLANTIC.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.096" end="00:04:58.465">IN MANY WAYS THE ATLANTIC CAME FIRST.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.465" end="00:04:59.466">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHAT I LOVE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.466" end="00:05:04.037">WITH THE NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS SO INTERESTING TO SEE THE LAYERS OF THE DEBATE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.037" end="00:05:04.638">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.638" end="00:05:09.443">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THE COLOR OF IT BECAUSE YOU FORGET THAT IT&apos;S NOT AS MONOCHROME ATTIC OF </p>
<p begin="00:05:09.443" end="00:05:13.447">WHAT YOU IMAGINE IN RETROSPECT IN MOST HISTORY BOOKS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.447" end="00:05:14.047">REALLY INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.047" end="00:05:17.584">I REALLY APPRECIATE IT I CAN&apos;T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE YOUR SON DO NEXT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.584" end="00:05:18.619">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:18.619" end="00:05:21.722">&gt;&gt; TAKE OUT THE TRASH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.722" end="00:05:23.857">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BY, REALLY APPRECIATE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.857" end="00:05:30.564">THANK YOU, IT&apos;S CALLED DECEMBER 1941, ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.</p>
