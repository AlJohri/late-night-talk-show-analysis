<p begin="00:01:17.077" end="00:01:19.913">&gt;&gt; YOU DODGED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.913" end="00:01:22.249">BECAUSE LET&apos;S SAY HE WINS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.249" end="00:01:26.887">AS HIS VICE PRESIDENT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU TO RUN AGAINST HIM IN 2016.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.887" end="00:01:28.822">SO -- </p>
<p begin="00:01:28.822" end="00:01:31.191">&gt;&gt; I THINK THIS IS MUCH BETTER FOR YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.191" end="00:01:36.096">HOW DID THAT -- DID THEY CALL TO TELL YOU?  HOW DID THEY DO IT?  HOW DID THEY BREAK THAT NEWS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.096" end="00:01:37.898">&gt;&gt; I TALKED TO THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.898" end="00:01:41.101">AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT IT IS NEXT DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.101" end="00:01:42.469">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE PERSONALLY CALLED YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.469" end="00:01:43.804">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.804" end="00:01:45.105">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU CURSED AT THEM?</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.105" end="00:01:48.609">&gt;&gt; NO, NO, I DIDN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.609" end="00:01:56.683">&gt;&gt; Jon: PAWLENTY, HAD HIS SON CALL, HE DID NOT CALL THEM AND ONE OF THEM, I THINK, WAS </p>
<p begin="00:01:56.683" end="00:01:59.553">NOTIFIED BY A STRIP O GRAM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.553" end="00:02:04.124">&gt;&gt; I READ THAT IN THE PAPER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.124" end="00:02:10.697">&gt;&gt; Jon: HAS HE WON YOU OVER?  HAS HE -- I STIPULATE THE BASE OF THE PARTY HAS NOT WARMED UP </p>
<p begin="00:02:10.697" end="00:02:11.164">TO HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.164" end="00:02:13.700">HOW HAS HE WON YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.700" end="00:02:14.501">&gt;&gt; WELL -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:14.501" end="00:02:16.336">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW HAS HE NOT WON YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.336" end="00:02:18.705">&gt;&gt; NO, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.705" end="00:02:23.177">FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW GOVERNOR ROMNEY, I HAVE KNOWN HIM SINCE 2007.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.177" end="00:02:26.847">&gt;&gt; Jon: YET YOU STILL HAVE TO CALL HIM GOVERNOR ROMNEY, THAT DOESN&apos;T SEEM RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.847" end="00:02:28.982">&gt;&gt; IT IS A RESPECTFUL THING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.982" end="00:02:29.349">&gt;&gt; Jon:.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.349" end="00:02:33.320">&gt;&gt; NOW, LOOK I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW HIM PERSONALLY, AS A PERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.320" end="00:02:38.692">I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH HIM ON THE POLICIES BUT IF YOU GET TO KNOW </p>
<p begin="00:02:38.692" end="00:02:43.964">HIM AS A PERSON, AS A FATHER, AS A LEADER IN HIS COMMUNITY I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO ADMIRE </p>
<p begin="00:02:43.964" end="00:02:48.268">THERE AND THERE IS A LOT I LIKE ABOUT HIM AND I JUST THINK THE DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT FROM WHEN </p>
<p begin="00:02:48.268" end="00:02:51.271">HE RAN IN &apos;08, THIS IS A MUCH BETTER CANDIDATE NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.271" end="00:02:53.006">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DID HE GET BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.006" end="00:02:57.611">BECAUSE HE WAS VERY WOODEN AND NOW HE IS -- NO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.611" end="00:02:58.712">NOW HE IS NOT WOODEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.712" end="00:03:00.147">HE IS MORE CLAY LIKE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.147" end="00:03:06.520">AND I THINK THAT IS AN IMPROVEMENT OF SUBSTANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.520" end="00:03:09.356">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T KNOW ABOUT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.356" end="00:03:09.723">&gt;&gt; Jon:.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.723" end="00:03:10.691">&gt;&gt; HE IS GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.691" end="00:03:12.259">I THINK HE REALLY CONNECTS WITH PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.259" end="00:03:15.963">AND THE TIMES HE HAS BEEN WITH ME, I MEAN HE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF GOING OUT ON THE STUMP </p>
<p begin="00:03:15.963" end="00:03:20.734">AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE BELIEVES IN AND SEE PEOPLE GET EXCITED ABOUT IT AND I THINK HE </p>
<p begin="00:03:20.734" end="00:03:22.536">WILL GIVE A GREAT SPEECH ON THURSDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.536" end="00:03:22.836">I DO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.836" end="00:03:23.937">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW YOU WERE INTRODUCING -- </p>

<p begin="00:03:34.314" end="00:03:36.183">&gt;&gt; THEY HAVEN&apos;T TOLD ME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.183" end="00:03:40.087">THE ONLY THING THEY ASKED ME TO DO IS INTRODUCE THE GOVERNOR AND AGAIN ME 15 MINUTES TO SAY </p>
<p begin="00:03:40.087" end="00:03:40.721">WHATEVER I WANT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.721" end="00:03:44.091">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WILL GO WITH?  HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.091" end="00:03:50.264">&gt;&gt; I HAVE GOT SOME STUFF I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN.</p>

<p begin="00:03:59.406" end="00:04:01.508">THEY SPEAK TO YOU AT ALL HERE IS A THEME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.508" end="00:04:04.411">LIKE WHAT IS IS A THEME THAT IS CLOSE TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO?</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.411" end="00:04:09.383">&gt;&gt; THE THEME OF THE NIGHT IS AMERICA&apos;S EXCEPTIONALISM, GREAT </p>
<p begin="00:04:09.383" end="00:04:11.652">AMERICA, WE BELIEVE IN AMERICA AND THAT IS THE THEME OF THE NIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.652" end="00:04:16.890">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY FEEL LIKE THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PUSHBACK ON THAT?  IT SEEMS LIKE ONE OF </p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:21.361">THOSE THINGS, MOST PEOPLE ARE LIKE YEAH, I WILL GO WITH THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.361" end="00:04:23.597">&gt;&gt; WHO WOULD BE AGAINST HOPE AND CHANGE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.597" end="00:04:24.965">&gt;&gt; Jon: EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.965" end="00:04:27.067">&gt;&gt; BUT LET&apos;S SHOW YOU WHAT THE CHANGE IS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.067" end="00:04:32.606">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW THAT IS AN INTERESTING -- I GUESS THE REAL DIFFERENCE IS, HE IS SAYING </p>
<p begin="00:04:32.606" end="00:04:36.310">PRIVATE ENTER SURPRISE THE WAY TO GO WHERE THEY THINK OBAMA IS SAYING GOVERNMENT ENTER BREEZE </p>
<p begin="00:04:36.310" end="00:04:38.312">IS THE WAY TO GO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.312" end="00:04:39.179">IS THAT THE REAL DIFFERENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.179" end="00:04:43.684">&gt;&gt; THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE ROLE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PLAY IN THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.684" end="00:04:48.088">HAVING THE PRESIDENT AS A BELIEVER AND MANY IN HIS PARTY ARE THAT THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:04:48.088" end="00:04:49.656">POLICIES CAN SPUR THAT ON,</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.656" end="00:04:52.392">SPECIAL SPENDING PROGRAM OF SOME SORT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.392" end="00:04:56.563">I FOR EXAMPLE, MOST PEOPLE IN MY PARTY BELIEVE WHAT GOVERNMENT CAN REALLY DO IS CREATE THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:56.563" end="00:05:00.567">CONDITIONS FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO INVEST AND GROW THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.567" end="00:05:02.269">AND THAT&apos;S WHAT THE ELECTION IS ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.269" end="00:05:03.770">&gt;&gt; Jon: DON&apos;T THEY WANT THE SAME THING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.770" end="00:05:05.339">&gt;&gt; GOVERNMENT CREATING CONDITIONS FOR -- </p>
<p begin="00:05:05.339" end="00:05:09.209">&gt;&gt; CREATE THE CONDITIONS IN TERMS OF HAVING FOR EXAMPLE PREDICTABLE POLICIES THAT ARE </p>
<p begin="00:05:09.209" end="00:05:16.817">STABLE AND THEN INCENTIVIZE THE STIMULATING OUR ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.817" end="00:05:22.923">&gt;&gt; SPENDING ROADS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, NOT LIKE BUILDING ROADS THAT WERE NOT WELL SPENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.923" end="00:05:24.925">AND MONEY THAT FLOWED TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.925" end="00:05:29.162">WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT IS THINGS THAT ARE MORE PERMANENT AND LASTING IN NATURE, FOR </p>
<p begin="00:05:29.162" end="00:05:35.302">EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAD A TAX CODE THAT INCREMENT VIED NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS EASY TO COMPLY </p>
<p begin="00:05:35.302" end="00:05:39.740">WITH BUT PERMANENT YOU KNEW WHAT THE TAXES WERE NOW AND TEN YEARS FROM NOW AND YOUR RATE OF RETURN </p>
<p begin="00:05:39.740" end="00:05:45.078">ON INVESTMENT WAS HIGH ENOUGH SO PEOPLE WOULD BE INCENTED IN INVESTING HERE INSTEAD OF SOME </p>
<p begin="00:05:45.078" end="00:05:45.479">OTHER PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.479" end="00:05:50.417">&gt;&gt; Jon: WOULDN&apos;T IT BE BEST IF WE JUST STOPPED THE ELECTION AT THAT POINT, BECAUSE -- </p>
<p begin="00:05:50.417" end="00:05:52.085">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU ONLY HAVE IT FOR TWO YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.085" end="00:05:54.655">&gt;&gt; YOU ARE SAYING IT CAN BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.655" end="00:05:58.392">CERTAINLY THAT IS TRUE, BUT WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A TAX CODE THAT IS SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF </p>
<p begin="00:05:58.392" end="00:05:58.792">THIS YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.792" end="00:06:01.328">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, MY GOD, THAT IS AWESOME.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.328" end="00:06:02.796">&gt;&gt; WELL, NOT THE WHOLE TAX CODE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.796" end="00:06:08.468">&gt;&gt; Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY!</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.468" end="00:06:09.837">&gt;&gt; YOU ARE BUSY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.837" end="00:06:13.340">DO YOU WANT TO WEB IT A LITTLE BIT OR HAVE TO GO.</p>
