<p begin="00:00:34.368" end="00:00:40.607">MY GUEST TONIGHT, FAREED ZAKARIA MAKING HIS 400th APPEARANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.607" end="00:00:54.855">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) FIRST, OBVIOUSLY, EVERYBODY IS STILL STUNNED AFTER THE TERRIBLE </p>
<p begin="00:00:54.855" end="00:00:56.023">SHOOTINGS FRIDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.023" end="00:01:02.262">ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET A HANDLE ON HOW TO PREVENT THESE TYPES OF TRAGEDIES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.262" end="00:01:04.798">I... IT&apos;S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.798" end="00:01:05.299">OBVIOUSLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.299" end="00:01:10.904">AN INTERSECTION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM, CULTURAL INFLUENCES, THE BALANCE BETWEEN </p>
<p begin="00:01:10.904" end="00:01:12.539">INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AND PUBLIC SAFETY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.539" end="00:01:14.741">THE VIABILITY OF GUNS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.741" end="00:01:18.545">&gt;&gt; I THINK NOW REALLY IS NOT THE TIME TO HAVE A BIG NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.545" end="00:01:36.496">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:36.496" end="00:01:39.233">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE... IT&apos;S A FACTOR.</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.103" end="00:01:45.272">OBVIOUSLY IT&apos;S A COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.272" end="00:01:49.276">OWNING A GUN IS A RIGHT PROTECTED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND THAT&apos;S... YOU KNOW, I AGREE </p>
<p begin="00:01:49.276" end="00:01:49.776">WITH THAT.</p>

<p begin="00:01:52.346" end="00:01:53.680">BUT WE CAN&apos;T HAVE TANKS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.680" end="00:01:59.720">(LAUGHTER) SO WE... IF WE DRAW LINES ON WEAPONRY, OBVIOUSLY, THE QUESTION IS HAVE WE DRAWN THEM RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.720" end="00:02:02.789">&gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION AND IT&apos;S, FRANKLY </p>

<p begin="00:02:50.103" end="00:02:57.177">STORIES CREATE SINUS PRESSURE IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET YOURSELF SOME SUDAFED TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:57.177" end="00:03:01.748">EASE THAT SINUS PAIN, THAT&apos;S REALLY HARD TO DO TO GET SUDAFED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.748" end="00:03:05.853">TO GET THAT GOOD SUDAFED YOU NEED I.D. AND THERE&apos;S A BACKGROUND CHECK AND THEN YOU&apos;VE </p>

<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:20.234">(LAUGHTER) SO WHILE WE ALSO TALK ABOUT SOCIETAL FACTORS AND MORAL FACTORS, YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD </p>
<p begin="00:03:20.234" end="00:03:24.638">ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW MORE AND MORE POWERFUL DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONRY...</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.638" end="00:03:27.508">&gt;&gt; TOO EARLY TO BE TALKING ABOUT MORE GUN CONTROL LAWS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.508" end="00:03:28.609">&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.</p>

<p begin="00:03:35.983" end="00:03:39.086">(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU!</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.086" end="00:03:53.967">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT&apos;S RIGHT, I USE THE SAME SHAMPOO AS MY DRESSAGE HORSES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.967" end="00:04:01.074">(LAUGHTER) SO YOU&apos;RE TELLING ME IT&apos;S TOO SOON TO EVEN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.074" end="00:04:08.582">YOU&apos;RE TELLING ME THAT TO DISCUSS THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY, FOR </p>
<p begin="00:04:08.582" end="00:04:11.118">THAT THERE IS A WAITING PERIOD?</p>

<p begin="00:04:30.504" end="00:04:33.407">I&apos;M NOT EVEN SAYING GUN CONTROL WOULD DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.407" end="00:04:36.643">I&apos;M JUST SAYING IT&apos;S GOT TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.643" end="00:04:43.417">IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT SHOWS THIS COUNTRY&apos;S PROBLEM-SOLVING MECHANISM IS NOT </p>
<p begin="00:04:43.417" end="00:04:44.518">IRREVOCABLY DAMAGED?</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.518" end="00:04:47.321">&gt;&gt; SHOULD COSTUMES BE BANNED FROM MOVIE THEATERS?</p>

<p begin="00:05:04.304" end="00:05:10.177">(LAUGHTER) THERE IS ONE AREA OF THIS MESS THAT I THINK IS ALSO WORTHY OF COMMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.177" end="00:05:16.416">AND IT&apos;S THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW EGG SYSTEM &quot;WHAT STORY DOES A GUY HAVE TO BLOW TO GET IN </p>

<p begin="00:07:54.474" end="00:08:00.380">(LAUGHTER) BECAUSE WHEN I WAS GOOGLING HIS NAME I SAW THE NAME &quot;THE TEA </p>
