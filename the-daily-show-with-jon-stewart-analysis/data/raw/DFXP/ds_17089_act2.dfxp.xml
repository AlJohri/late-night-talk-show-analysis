<p begin="00:00:15.883" end="00:00:19.086">THEY&apos;RE EVERYWHERE AND APPARENTLY THEY&apos;RE NOW ALLOWED TO VOTE.</p>

<p begin="00:00:29.496" end="00:00:31.365">&gt;&gt; WOMEN ARE THE TIPPING VOTE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.365" end="00:00:32.266">&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE TO WIN WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.266" end="00:00:34.034">&gt;&gt; WOMEN, WOMEN, WOMEN, WOMEN,</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.034" end="00:00:34.368">WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.368" end="00:00:35.636">&gt;&gt; BUT JUST WHO ARE THEY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.636" end="00:00:41.375">TO GET INSIDE THE MIND OF A TYPICAL WOMAN VOTER I SAT DOWN WITH POLITICAL STRATEGIST TAD DIVINE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.375" end="00:00:41.808">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:00:41.808" end="00:00:44.778">&gt;&gt; WOMEN ARE THE MOST CRITICAL VOTING BLOCK IN OUR ELECTORATE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.778" end="00:00:47.548">POLITICIANS WHO IGNORE WOMEN DO SO AT THEIR OWN POLITICAL PERIL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.548" end="00:00:50.117">WOMEN ARE THE NEW SOCCER MOMS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.117" end="00:00:55.956">&gt;&gt; WELL, SOCCER MOMS WERE CRITICAL SWING VOTE IN 2004 AND WOMEN IN THIS ELECTION I THINK </p>
<p begin="00:00:55.956" end="00:01:03.463">ARE PARTICULARLY MOTIVATED BY THE RHETORIC...</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.463" end="00:01:05.465">&gt;&gt; SORRY, I&apos;M GOING TO STOP YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.465" end="00:01:09.736">I THINK IT&apos;S EMBARRASSING THAT TWO GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN WITH NO WOMEN PRESENT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.736" end="00:01:10.237">EXCUSE ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.237" end="00:01:15.108">&gt;&gt; THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY FOR FAR TOO LONG.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.108" end="00:01:21.849">LIKE WHEN DARRELL ISSA HELD AN ALL-MALE PANEL ON CONTRACEPTION AND WHEN MSNBC AND FOX HELD ALL </p>
<p begin="00:01:21.849" end="00:01:23.083">MALE PANELS TO TALK ABOUT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.083" end="00:01:27.087">&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU DO A PIECE ABOUT WOMEN WHEN THERE&apos;S ONLY MEN TALKING ABOUT IT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.087" end="00:01:27.788">IT&apos;S PATHETIC.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.788" end="00:01:28.722">GET SOME WOMEN HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.722" end="00:01:32.893">&gt;&gt; TAD, I&apos;M SORRY WE&apos;RE GOING TO TALK...</p>

<p begin="00:01:33.660" end="00:01:35.696">&gt;&gt; CHANGE WAS GOING TO BEGIN WITH ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.696" end="00:01:41.668">SO I ASSEMBLED REPRESENTATIVES FROM SOME OF THE LEADING WOMEN&apos;S GROUPS-- THE NATIONAL </p>
<p begin="00:01:41.668" end="00:01:44.805">ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN, EMILY&apos;S LIST, ELEANOR&apos;S LEGACY, GIRLS </p>
<p begin="00:01:44.805" end="00:01:48.208">FOR GENDER EQUITY AND THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.208" end="00:01:52.813">HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT WOMEN ARE HEARD?</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.813" end="00:01:54.681">TAD, I&apos;M GOING TO START WITH YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.681" end="00:01:55.115">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:55.115" end="00:01:56.817">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT&apos;S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.817" end="00:02:01.188">FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE MORE WOMEN THAN MEN WHO VOTE IN THIS COUNTRY SO THEY HAVE A HUGE VOICE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.188" end="00:02:06.059">&gt;&gt; IF WE HYPOTHETICALLY HAD A GROUP OF WOMEN IN A ROOM, WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD BE </p>
<p begin="00:02:06.059" end="00:02:06.827">THINKING RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.827" end="00:02:07.127">TADD?</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.127" end="00:02:10.664">&gt;&gt; ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ACTUALLY TALK TO THEM AND LISTEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.664" end="00:02:11.098">AND LISTEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.098" end="00:02:13.800">TALK TO THEM AND LISTEN AND YOU&apos;LL HEAR WHAT THEY THINK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:18.639">&gt;&gt; LISTENING IS SO KEY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.639" end="00:02:19.072">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:19.072" end="00:02:19.940">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE JUST PISSED OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.940" end="00:02:20.574">&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.574" end="00:02:24.878">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE PISSED OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.878" end="00:02:25.779">&gt;&gt; PARDON HE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.779" end="00:02:27.281">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE PISSED OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.281" end="00:02:29.082">WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.082" end="00:02:32.553">&gt;&gt; WOMEN WANT EQUALITY, WOMEN WANT SAFETY, WOMEN WANT EQUAL PAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.553" end="00:02:35.088">&gt;&gt; WOMEN ON AVERAGE ARE BEING PAID 77 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.088" end="00:02:40.894">&gt;&gt; WOMEN WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED LIKE FULL-FLEDGED CITIZENS AND TO HAVE OUR LIVES </p>
<p begin="00:02:40.894" end="00:02:44.831">RECOGNIZED AND NOT DEVALUED AND MARGINALIZED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.831" end="00:02:45.699">WE COUNT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.699" end="00:02:46.934">&gt;&gt; TAD, DO THEY COUNT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.934" end="00:02:51.271">&gt;&gt; THEY CERTAINLY DO WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTORAL POLITICS, THE MOST IMPORTANT POWERFUL FORCE </p>
<p begin="00:02:51.271" end="00:02:52.306">AND AMERICAN ELECTORAL POLITICS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.306" end="00:02:55.642">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S KIND OF JUST THE POINT I MADE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.642" end="00:02:58.846">&gt;&gt; WOMEN ARE AN IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL FORCE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.846" end="00:03:01.181">BUT WHICH ISSUES DO THEY CARE ABOUT MOST IN 2012?</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.181" end="00:03:04.351">&gt;&gt; MY WIFE HAS THE OCCASION, AS YOU KNOW, TO CAMPAIGN ON HER OWN </p>
<p begin="00:03:04.351" end="00:03:14.461">AND ALSO WITH ME AND SHE REPORTS TO ME REGULARLY THAT THE ISSUE WOMEN CARE ABOUT MOST IS THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.461" end="00:03:17.865">&gt;&gt; IS THE ECONOMY REALLY THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR WOMEN,</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.865" end="00:03:18.298">STPHA *D.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.298" end="00:03:21.235">&gt;&gt; I THINK WOMEN, LIKE MEN, IF YOU ASK THEM IN THE POLLS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.235" end="00:03:24.505">WHAT&apos;S THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE SAY JOBS, THE ECONOMY, ECONOMIC ISSUES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.505" end="00:03:27.641">&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE DOWN HERE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.641" end="00:03:30.143">WHAT&apos;S SHE THINKING?</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.143" end="00:03:32.379">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M A WOMAN WHO WANT MISBIRTH CONTROL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.379" end="00:03:36.483">NO ONE NEEDS AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY OUR CIVILIZATION NEEDS IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.483" end="00:03:38.118">VIRTUALLY ALL WOMEN USE BIRTH CONTROL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.118" end="00:03:40.120">&gt;&gt; TAD, DO ALL WOMEN USE BIRTH CONTROL?</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.120" end="00:03:48.562">&gt;&gt; WELL, I&apos;VE SEEN IN POLLS THAT 99% OF WOMEN OF CHILD BEARING AGE IN FACT HAVE USED CONTRACEPTIVES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.562" end="00:03:50.497">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE HERE AND WE CAN SPEAK FOR OURSELVES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.497" end="00:03:56.837">WE NEED TO HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF CONTRACEPTIONS WE&apos;LL USE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.837" end="00:03:59.206">&gt;&gt; Jon: TAD WHEN SHE SAYS THAT WHAT DUD SHE MEAN?</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.206" end="00:04:02.476">&gt;&gt; I THINK SHE&apos;S REFERRING TO SOMEONE WHO&apos;S BEEN TOLD BY A </p>
<p begin="00:04:02.476" end="00:04:06.380">BUNCH OF MEN... LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE CONTRA ACCEPTION HEARING WAS HELD BY </p>
<p begin="00:04:06.380" end="00:04:09.516">THE HOUSE, CONGRESSMAN ISSA HELD THE HEARING AND DECIDED TO TALK </p>
<p begin="00:04:09.516" end="00:04:14.254">ABOUT FIVE MEN, I CAN&apos;T IMAGINE HOW OFFENSIVE AN EVENT LIKE THAT WAS FOR ALL WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.254" end="00:04:16.290">&gt;&gt; WELL, I DON&apos;T THINK IT&apos;S JUST THAT WOMEN...</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.290" end="00:04:18.492">&gt;&gt; TAD WAS NOT FINISHED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.492" end="00:04:18.792">TAD?</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.792" end="00:04:22.129">&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY PATHETIC, I&apos;LL TELL YOU THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.129" end="00:04:23.497">AND WHAT WAS EVEN MORE PATHETIC..</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.497" end="00:04:25.232">&gt;&gt; THIS HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.232" end="00:04:27.868">WE KNOW WHAT&apos;S GOING ON WE FEEL DON&apos;T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO FACE </p>
<p begin="00:04:27.868" end="00:04:32.773">THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE LIGHT OF THIS AND FOR THIS TO BE A JOKE SO WE NEED TO BE HEARD HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.773" end="00:04:35.375">&gt;&gt; I... I&apos;M SORRY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.375" end="00:04:37.277">I APOLOGIZE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.277" end="00:04:40.080">SOMETIMES WE&apos;RE GETTING CARRIED AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:50.390">I F I CAME OFF AS RUDE, IGNORANT OR SEXIST IN ANYWAY I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE TO ALL OF YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.390" end="00:04:53.093">ESPECIALLY WHAT WOMEN ARE GOING THROUGH IN THESE TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.093" end="00:04:53.527">I&apos;M SORRY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.527" end="00:04:53.994">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.</p>

<p begin="00:04:54.461" end="00:04:57.931">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.931" end="00:05:03.904">&gt;&gt; NOW, TAD, IS THAT THE TYPE OF PANDERING CANDIDATES WILL NEED TO REACH THE WOMEN BLOCK?</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.904" end="00:05:04.304">(APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:05:04.304" end="00:05:09.476">&gt;&gt; I THINK IF WE SHOWED THE FILM OF YOUR APOLOGY, YEAH, IT WOULD GO OVER VERY WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.476" end="00:05:15.549">&gt;&gt; CANDIDATES, THE LESSON IS CLEAR IN 2012, WOMEN FINALLY MATTER.</p>
