<p begin="00:00:10.244" end="00:00:14.047">THE UNIVERSITIES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE END OFIMNESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.047" end="00:00:16.450">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM DR. DAVID AGUS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.450" end="00:00:20.921">(APPLAUSE) HELLO, SIR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.921" end="00:00:24.625">GOOD TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.625" end="00:00:26.026">THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.026" end="00:00:28.428">THE BOOK IS CALLED THE END OF ILLNESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.428" end="00:00:32.165">DR. AGUS, BEFORE WE TALK, IS THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE ARE HAVING RIGHT NOW, DOES </p>
<p begin="00:00:32.165" end="00:00:35.536">THAT COUNT AS ME GOING OUT OF NETWORK?</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.536" end="00:00:35.969">IS THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.969" end="00:00:39.273">&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR DEDUCTIBLE UP FRONT BUT WE&apos;RE GOING TO COLLECT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.273" end="00:00:40.307">&gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.307" end="00:00:40.674">&gt;&gt; GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.674" end="00:00:47.581">THIS IS A PHENOMENAL, I AM A JEW, I&apos;M JEWISH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.581" end="00:00:49.850">SO I THINK A LOT ABOUT ILLNESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.850" end="00:00:52.219">BUT TYPICALLY NOT THE END OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.219" end="00:00:56.123">I&apos;M USUALLY THINKING PORE ABOUT THE BEGINNINGS OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.123" end="00:00:57.991">A FASCINATING WAY TO LOOK AT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.991" end="00:01:02.162">SUMMARIZE FOR ME SORT OF YOUR THESIS STATEMENT ABOUT THE WAY WE HAVE VIEWED </p>
<p begin="00:01:02.162" end="00:01:04.464">ILLNESS INCORRECTLY IN THIS COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.464" end="00:01:05.866">&gt;&gt; WE LACK AT IT DOWN DEEP,</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.866" end="00:01:07.067">ONE LITTLE FACTOR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.067" end="00:01:08.936">SO TO ME YOU HAVE CANCER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.936" end="00:01:09.903">YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.903" end="00:01:12.973">WELL, TO ME THOSE DISEASES ARE VERBS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.973" end="00:01:15.075">YOU ARE CAN SERG, YOU ARE HEART DISEASING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.075" end="00:01:17.744">AND I WANT TO TAKE YOU FROM A CANCER STATE THE OTHER DIRECTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.744" end="00:01:19.780">AND I WANT TO PREVENT ILLNESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.780" end="00:01:22.249">I&apos;M A GUY WHO SEES PEOPLE DYING OF CANCER EVERY DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.249" end="00:01:25.152">I DON&apos;T WANT-- RZ ARE YOU ONCOLOGIST.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.152" end="00:01:26.653">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M A CANCER DOCTOR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.653" end="00:01:28.088">I WANT TO PREVENT DISEASE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.088" end="00:01:28.755">WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.755" end="00:01:30.123">WE HAVE THE MEANS TO DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.123" end="00:01:31.825">WE JUST HAVE GOT TO ENACT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.825" end="00:01:36.930">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE HAVE BECOME A COUNTRY THAT TREATS DISEASE BUT DOES NOT PREVENT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.930" end="00:01:42.102">YOU MAKE THE CASE THAT INFLAMMATION IS REALLY THE CULPRIT IN MUCH OF THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.102" end="00:01:45.439">&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT&apos;S THE ROOT CAUSE OF THINGS LIKE HEART DISEASE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.439" end="00:01:45.772">CANCER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.772" end="00:01:46.940">WE CAN REDUCE INFLAMMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.940" end="00:01:50.277">YOU ARE TAKING ASPIRIN AN DAY REDUCES INFLAMMATION,</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.277" end="00:01:55.382">LOWERS YOUR RATE OF CANCER DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE AS WELL AS A DRAMATIC AFFECT ON HEART DISEASE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.382" end="00:01:56.984">WHY AREN&apos;T WE MANDATING IT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.984" end="00:02:02.155">&gt;&gt; WE LIKE CANCER?</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.155" end="00:02:04.191">BUT IT&apos;S VERY INTERESTING,</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.191" end="00:02:12.366">YOU TALK ABOUT HOW DISCOVERING MICROBES, BACTERIAL ENVIRONMENTS ACTUALLY TURNED </p>
<p begin="00:02:12.366" end="00:02:16.470">OUT TO IN SOME WAYS SET MEDICINE BACK BECAUSE WE NO LONGER THERE IS A VERY </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.470" end="00:02:20.207">INTERESTING THING IN HERE WRITTEN IN THE 1920s BY A PHYSICIAN WHO IS TALKING </p>
<p begin="00:02:20.207" end="00:02:23.944">ABOUT HOW PASTURE AND THOSE GUYS KIND OF RUINED THE WAY WE LOOK AT HEALTH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.944" end="00:02:25.646">&gt;&gt; PRETTY COOL, YOU REALLY READ THE BOOK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.646" end="00:02:27.748">I LOVE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.748" end="00:02:30.484">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S ABOUT ILLNESS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.484" end="00:02:36.590">I&apos;VE BEEN READING THIS FOR 49 YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.590" end="00:02:42.262">&gt;&gt; SO 1920s WE MADE A DRUG TO TREAT INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAD </p>
<p begin="00:02:42.262" end="00:02:43.764">A DIAGNOSIS, YOU HAD A CURE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.764" end="00:02:47.000">WE THOUGHT ALL DISEASES WOULD BE LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.000" end="00:02:49.369">WELL CANCER ISN&apos;T FROM WITHOUT, IT&apos;S FROM WITHIN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.369" end="00:02:51.972">THAT BACTERIA DOESN&apos;T CARE IF ARE YOU TALL, SHORT,</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.972" end="00:02:54.474">ROUND, FAT, GREEN, WHITE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.474" end="00:02:56.677">IT IS JUST AN ANT BIOTIC.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.677" end="00:02:58.111">CANCER, HEART DISEASE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.111" end="00:02:59.513">ALZHEIMER, THEY&apos;RE VERY DIFFERENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.513" end="00:03:01.148">IT IS THE INTERACTION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.148" end="00:03:02.516">YOU HAVE TO TREAT THE WHOLE SYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.516" end="00:03:04.918">IT IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HEALTH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.918" end="00:03:07.955">AS WE CALL IT,.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.955" end="00:03:12.726">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND SO MANY MORE OF US DIE FROM THESE COMPLEX INFLAMMATORY DISEASES THAN </p>
<p begin="00:03:12.726" end="00:03:14.094">THESE PATHOGENS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.094" end="00:03:16.463">&gt;&gt; EVOLUTION SELECTS OUT FOR WHO HAS GOOD KIDS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.463" end="00:03:24.538">IT DOESN&apos;T SELECT OUT FOR WHO-- WITH YOU NEVER MET MY GRANDCHILDREN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.538" end="00:03:32.513">&gt;&gt; DARWIN WASN&apos;T ALWAYS SO SMART.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.513" end="00:03:33.480">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M KIDDING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.480" end="00:03:39.820">I&apos;M SURE GOITERS HAVE SOME EVOLUTIONARY REASON FOR EXISTING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.820" end="00:03:43.790">&gt;&gt; YOU TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE BEING SEDENTARY, EVEN AFTER DOING EXERCISE IN THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:43.790" end="00:03:46.793">MORNING, BEING SEDENTARY IS AS BAD FOR YOU AS SMOKING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.793" end="00:03:52.266">NOW I QUIT SMOKE BEING TEN YEARS AGO BUT I STILL-- BUT HEAR&apos;S, LET ME GET TO WHAT I </p>
<p begin="00:03:52.266" end="00:03:54.835">AM GETTING TO, BUT I STILL SIT ON MY ASS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.835" end="00:04:00.774">SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS, IF RI WERE TO GET RID OF MY DESK CAN I GO BACK TO SMOKING?</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.774" end="00:04:03.810">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S NOT A BINARY, YOU CAN&apos;T DO ONE OR THE OTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.810" end="00:04:06.547">&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, BUT THE DATA ARE JUST AMAZING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.547" end="00:04:10.350">1953 THEY LOOK AT THE BRITISH TRANSIT AUTHORITY WORKERS, OVER 20,000.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.350" end="00:04:13.453">HALF WERE THE BUS DRIVERS THAT SAT THERE 90%, AND HALF THE TICKET TAKERS THAT </p>
<p begin="00:04:13.453" end="00:04:15.122">WALKED AND TOOK THE TICKETS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.122" end="00:04:18.859">SAME WEIGHT AMONG THEM BUT HALF THE DEATH RATE OF HEART DISEASE IN THE TICKET TAKERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.859" end="00:04:21.228">WE GOT TO MOVE DURING THE DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.228" end="00:04:23.297">MAKES A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN WHAT WE DO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.297" end="00:04:25.732">&gt;&gt; SO IS THIS, WHY DOESN&apos;T THIS CATCH ON?</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.732" end="00:04:28.335">IT DOESN&apos;T SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE OTHER THAN THE VITAMIN THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.335" end="00:04:29.837">THERE IS A VITAMIN THING IN HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.837" end="00:04:34.575">YOU SAY SAY VITAMINS ACTUALLY COULD CAUSE US MORE HARM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.575" end="00:04:39.780">&gt;&gt; THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS 200 MILLION, OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT TO LOOK AT VIT MEN E TO </p>
<p begin="00:04:39.780" end="00:04:41.682">PREVENT PROSTATE CANCER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.682" end="00:04:43.951">17% HIGHER INCIDENCE WHEN YOU TAKE IT FOR THREE YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.951" end="00:04:47.087">YOU STOP IT, THAT LASTS FOR THREE YEARS AFTER STOPPING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.087" end="00:04:51.091">THE MOST COMMON NONSKIN CANCER IN MEN, 17% HIGHER,</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.091" end="00:04:52.125">WHAT AM I MISSING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.125" end="00:04:53.527">WHY ARE WE TAKING THESE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.527" end="00:04:57.631">50 LARGE STUDIES OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE, NEVER A BENEFIT IN HEART DISEASE AND CANCER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.631" end="00:04:59.333">I DON&apos;T GET IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.333" end="00:05:03.670">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY IS, WHY DO WE HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME ALLOWING SCIENCE TO OVERCOME </p>
<p begin="00:05:03.670" end="00:05:05.506">OUR IRRATIONALITY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.506" end="00:05:09.610">BECAUSE IF YOU-- LIKE I&apos;M VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE WHOLE LIKE HERE&apos;S SOME FISH </p>
<p begin="00:05:09.610" end="00:05:11.845">OIL PILLS AND CHEW THIS UP AND YOU WILL BE FINE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.845" end="00:05:16.483">AND THAT&apos;S SO MUCH BETTER TO ME THAN THAT THING YOU JUST SAID ABOUT WALKING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.483" end="00:05:18.685">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:18.685" end="00:05:20.220">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT&apos;S HOPE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.220" end="00:05:21.588">IT&apos;S SIMPLE AND IT&apos;S HOPE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.588" end="00:05:24.658">WE WANT TO DO THINGS VERY QUICKLY, VERY EASILY IN OUR COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.658" end="00:05:29.830">A PILL IS A GREAT WAY TO DO IT FORGET ABOUT FOOD, I WILL JUST TAKE THAT PILL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.830" end="00:05:32.833">IT IS EMPOWERING TO JUST SPEND $20 IN VITAMINS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.833" end="00:05:34.935">WE HAVE TO CHANINGT CULTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.935" end="00:05:35.936">REAL FOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.936" end="00:05:38.672">YOU EAT YOUR LUNCH TODAY AT NOON.</p>
