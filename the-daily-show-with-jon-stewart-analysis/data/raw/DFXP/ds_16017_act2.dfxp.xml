<p begin="00:00:06.940" end="00:00:12.479">YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK&apos;S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, PRESIDENT OBAMA ISSUED OUR NATION A CHALLENGE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.479" end="00:00:17.217">&gt;&gt; HALF A CENTURY AGO WHEN THE SOVIETS BEAT US INTO SPACE WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:17.217" end="00:00:20.687">SATELLITE CALLED SPUTNIK,....</p>
