<p begin="00:00:07.541" end="00:00:12.279">MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A SECURITY ANALYST AS WELL AS A BEST SELLING AUTHOR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.279" end="00:00:16.683">HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE LONGEST WAR, THE ENDURING CONFLICT BETWEEN AMERICA AND AL QAEDA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.683" end="00:00:22.689">PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM PETER BERGEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.196" end="00:00:30.197">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.197" end="00:00:33.700">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE LONGEST WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.700" end="00:00:36.336">AMERICA&apos;S ENDURING CONFLICT BETWEEN AMERICA AND AL QAEDA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.336" end="00:00:39.506">IS THIS OUR LONGEST WAR?</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.506" end="00:00:42.242">&gt;&gt; DEPENDING ON HOW YOU COUNT THE VIETNAM WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.242" end="00:00:45.379">WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE IN AFGHANISTAN UNTIL 2014.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.379" end="00:00:48.148">AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT IS THE LONGEST WAR THAT WE&apos;VE ENGAGED IN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.148" end="00:00:51.051">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU THINK IT MAY GO FURTHER THAN 2014?</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.051" end="00:00:54.154">DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT THAT 2014 IS A DRAWDOWN POINT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.154" end="00:01:00.761">&gt;&gt; I THINK WE&apos;LL BE IN AFGHANISTAN FOR AS LONG AS WE ARE... WE&apos;VE BEEN IN SOUTH KOREA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.761" end="00:01:04.898">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE&apos;RE NEVER LEAVING?</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.898" end="00:01:08.402">OOPS, DID I LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG FOR SOUTH KOREA?</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.402" end="00:01:14.174">SORRY, SOUTH KOREA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.174" end="00:01:18.178">NOW, REBUILDING SOUTH KOREA AND BEING THERE AS A STABILIZING FORCE IS VERY </p>
<p begin="00:01:18.178" end="00:01:20.814">DIFFERENT THAN DOING IT IN AFGHANISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.814" end="00:01:23.350">ANOTHER DOLLAR JUST FELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.350" end="00:01:25.919">MICHAEL STEELE MAKING IT RAIN AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.919" end="00:01:28.121">HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN,</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.121" end="00:01:32.226">YOU KNOW,... SOUTH CAREER I CAN&apos;T IS AT LEAST A STABLE COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.226" end="00:01:34.995">AFGHANISTAN, WE STILL HAVEN&apos;T GOTTEN IT TO THAT POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.995" end="00:01:40.300">&gt;&gt; TRUE BUT SOUTH KOREA HAS SUFFERED TREMENDOUS DAMAGE DURING THE KOREAN WAR, WORSE </p>
<p begin="00:01:40.300" end="00:01:41.702">SHAPE THAN AFGHANISTAN TODAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.702" end="00:01:44.638">I&apos;VE BEEN VISITING AFGHANISTAN SINCE &apos;93.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.638" end="00:01:47.708">THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES FOR THE GOOD SINCE 9/11.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.708" end="00:01:49.042">MILLIONS OF GIRLS ARE IN SCHOOL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.042" end="00:01:50.077">THERE IS A FUNCTIONING ECONOMY,</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.077" end="00:01:50.911">KIND OF.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.911" end="00:01:54.047">A LOT OF OF COURSE IS A DRUG ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.047" end="00:01:55.916">BUT THERE IS, YOU KNOW, THERE IS PROGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.916" end="00:02:00.921">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU THINK THEIR VIEWPOINT... WHY DID RUSSIA...</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.921" end="00:02:07.528">WHY WERE THEY NOT ABLE TO STAY THERE AND YET WE SOMEHOW HAVE MANAGED TO HOLD ON?</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.528" end="00:02:14.201">&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, THE SOVIETS FACED A COUNTRYWIDE INSURRECTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.201" end="00:02:15.569">EVERY CAST AND ETHNIC GROUP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.569" end="00:02:20.040">THEY HAD ONE OF THE WORLD&apos;S WORST ARMIES AND THEY WERE HATED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.040" end="00:02:21.475">WE&apos;RE NOT HATED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.475" end="00:02:25.245">62% OF AFGHANS TODAY HAVE A FAVORABLE VIEW OF INTERNATIONAL FORCES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.245" end="00:02:27.781">THEY WANT US TO PERFORM NOT TO LEAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.781" end="00:02:32.819">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY WOULD... IF YOU&apos;RE AL QAEDA, NOW, LET&apos;S TAKE IT FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.819" end="00:02:38.025">DID THESE WARS... WHAT WAS THE BEST RESULT THEY COULD HAVE HOPED FOR?</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.025" end="00:02:39.459">IT&apos;S AFTER 9/11.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.459" end="00:02:42.896">WHAT DID THEY THINK WAS GOING TO BE THE RESULT OF THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.896" end="00:02:47.634">&gt;&gt; WHAT THEY WANTED WAS THE UNITED STATES TO PULL OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND ALL THESE </p>
<p begin="00:02:47.634" end="00:02:50.504">AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES WOULD THEN CRUMBLE AROUND THE REGION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.504" end="00:02:52.172">NONE OF THAT HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.172" end="00:02:54.341">WE WENT INTO AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.341" end="00:02:57.144">OUR RELATIONS WITH SAUDI ARABIA AND EGYPT ARE STRONGER THAN EVER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.144" end="00:02:59.279">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY COULDN&apos;T HAVE BEEN THAT NAIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.279" end="00:03:03.083">THEY DIDN&apos;T THINK WE&apos;LL ATTACK THEM ON 9/11 AND THEY&apos;LL GO AWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.083" end="00:03:04.318">&gt;&gt; THEY WERE THAT NAIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.318" end="00:03:09.323">WE INTERVIEWED OSAMA BIN LADEN IN &apos;97.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.323" end="00:03:14.261">WE TALKED ABOUT VIETNAM, AND THAT WAS HIS ANALYSIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.261" end="00:03:16.964">WE WERE AS WEAK AS THE SOVIET UNION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.964" end="00:03:21.935">&gt;&gt; Jon: ISN&apos;T THEIR IDEA THAT WE INVOLVE OURSELVES IN ALL THESE CONFLICTS AND IT SLOWLY </p>
<p begin="00:03:21.935" end="00:03:22.736">BLEEDS US?</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.736" end="00:03:23.704">OF MONEY, OF WILL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.704" end="00:03:25.138">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S WHAT THEY HOPE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.138" end="00:03:26.807">THEY&apos;RE NOT ECONOMISTS EITHER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.807" end="00:03:29.176">WE&apos;RE SPENDING 1% OF G.D.P. IN AFGHANISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.176" end="00:03:32.513">WE SPENT 10% OF G.D.P. DURING THE VIETNAM WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.513" end="00:03:34.314">IT&apos;S EXPENSIVE BUT WE&apos;RE A VERY LARGE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.314" end="00:03:39.653">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THOUGH BECAUSE WE ARE NOW AN ALL VOLUNTEER ARMY </p>
<p begin="00:03:39.653" end="00:03:43.524">WE&apos;RE PUTTING AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF STRESS ON OUR FIGHTING FORCE, ON THE MEN AND </p>
<p begin="00:03:43.524" end="00:03:46.026">WOMEN THAT HAVE NOW, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.026" end="00:03:50.864">CAN WE SUSTAIN THIS WITHOUT BREAKING THEIR SPIRIT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.864" end="00:03:55.669">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE&apos;RE DRAWING DOWN VERY SUBSTANTIALLY IN IRAQ THERE IS SOME, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.669" end="00:03:56.870">FLEXIBILITY NOW IN THE SYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.870" end="00:03:58.438">I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.438" end="00:04:00.174">PEOPLE ARE BEING DEPLOYED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.174" end="00:04:02.009">I WAS IN AFGHANISTAN IN DECEMBER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.009" end="00:04:05.245">I MET SOMEBODY BEING DEPLOYED FOR THE 7th TIME IN AFGHANISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.245" end="00:04:08.315">THAT PUTS TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON THE FAMILY, THE PERSON, THE INSTITUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.315" end="00:04:10.584">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW BIG IS AL QAEDA?</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.584" end="00:04:17.157">DO THEY HAVE... YOU KNOW, I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY WE SAW THEM AS DANGEROUS AS, LET&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:04:17.157" end="00:04:20.060">SAY, THE SPREAD OF COMMUNISM OR NAZISM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.060" end="00:04:27.134">IT SEEMS LIKE AN IDEOLOGY THAT CANNOT EVER REALLY TAKE A FOOTHOLD BECAUSE IT&apos;S A LITTLE DARK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.134" end="00:04:31.238">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT PROMISES A LOT AND DELIVERS ALMOST NOTHING,</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.238" end="00:04:31.538">RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.538" end="00:04:35.175">THERE&apos;S NO AL QAEDA SOCIAL WELFARE OR SERVICES OR HOSPITALS OR SCHOOLS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.175" end="00:04:38.245">I MEAN IT WOULD BE OXYMORONIC.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.245" end="00:04:42.916">THIS IS A GROUP THAT PRE-TENDS TO DEFEND TRUE MUSLIM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.916" end="00:04:45.285">A LOT OF MUSLIMS HAVE TURNED AGAINST IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.285" end="00:04:49.656">THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION I THINK AND I DEAL WITH THAT IN THE BOOK TO SOME DEGREE SAW </p>
<p begin="00:04:49.656" end="00:04:53.894">9/11 IN THE CONTEXT OF A THREAT LIKE NAZISM OR COMMUNISM WHICH WAS CRAZY </p>
<p begin="00:04:53.894" end="00:04:58.899">BECAUSE THE NAZIS INSTIGATED A GLOBAL CONFLICT THAT KILLED TENS OF IN ILL IONS OF PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.899" end="00:05:03.403">IF THE COLD WAR HAD ENDED WITH A BANG INSTEAD OF A WIMPER, WE WOULDN&apos;T BE ON THIS PROGRAM </p>
<p begin="00:05:03.403" end="00:05:05.339">BECAUSE WE&apos;D ALL BE DEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.339" end="00:05:07.508">&gt;&gt; Jon: SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.508" end="00:05:09.142">BASIC CABLE, BABY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.142" end="00:05:12.446">I HAVE NO IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.446" end="00:05:15.148">I&apos;M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE ALWAYS... YEAH,</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.148" end="00:05:17.918">THEY HAVE THIS DARK IDEOLOGY,</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.918" end="00:05:18.318">WHATEVER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.318" end="00:05:22.890">AND THE DANGER THAT THEY&apos;LL GET THEIR HANDS ON THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.890" end="00:05:26.126">IT WILL HAVE TO BE LIKE A ONE- SHOT DEAL FOR THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.126" end="00:05:27.694">THEY&apos;LL GET ONE SHOT AT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.694" end="00:05:28.962">THEY&apos;LL BE TURNED TO, I GUESS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.962" end="00:05:30.030">GLASS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.030" end="00:05:37.070">YOU KNOW, THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD PUT TOGETHER A SUSTAINED THREAT TO OUR SOCIETY SEEMS UNLIKELY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.070" end="00:05:40.674">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S SUSTAINED BUT IT&apos;S NOT AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.674" end="00:05:45.846">WE SAW ON CHRISTMAS DAY 2009 THEY ALMOST BROUGHT DOWN A FLIGHT OVER DETROIT WITH 300 </p>
<p begin="00:05:45.846" end="00:05:46.747">AMERICANS ON BOARD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.747" end="00:05:51.051">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT IS NOT TO MINIMIZE THAT TYPE OF CARNAGE WHICH IS TERRIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.051" end="00:05:55.889">BUT IT SEEMS LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT BY INVADING COUNTRIES AND THEN HAVING TO STAY AND </p>
<p begin="00:05:55.889" end="00:06:04.965">THEN REBUILD THEM FOREVER SEEMS LIKE IT MAY BE A DIFFICULT STRATEGY TO SUSTAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.965" end="00:06:07.334">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK THEY&apos;LL BE INVADING IN ANY OTHER MUSLIM </p>
<p begin="00:06:07.334" end="00:06:09.303">COUNTRIES IN THE SHORT TERM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.303" end="00:06:12.940">&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.940" end="00:06:15.475">WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.475" end="00:06:21.915">ISN&apos;T THAT... IS THAT BECAUSE THESE OTHER COUNTRIES WILL NO LONGER PROVIDE SHELTER FOR </p>
<p begin="00:06:21.915" end="00:06:25.519">THESE AL QAEDA FORCES OR BECAUSE WE&apos;RE JUST TAKING A DIFFERENT TACT?</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.519" end="00:06:28.856">&gt;&gt; I THINK WE&apos;RE TAKING A DIFFERENT TACK.</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.856" end="00:06:33.727">WE&apos;RE INVOLVED HELPING THE YEMENI GOVERNMENT WITH DRONES AND SPECIAL FORCES AND SMALL </p>

<p begin="00:06:35.229" end="00:06:37.931">WE&apos;RE NOT GOING TO INVADE YEMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.931" end="00:06:39.266">&gt;&gt; Jon: AS OF YET.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.266" end="00:06:40.667">&gt;&gt; LET&apos;S TAKE A BET ON IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.667" end="00:06:43.136">I VERY MUCH DOUBT IT.</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.772" end="00:06:49.610">&gt;&gt; Jon: I HOPE WE DON&apos;T INVADE... I&apos;M NOT A BIG FAN OF </p>
<p begin="00:06:49.610" end="00:06:50.744">INVADING A BUNCH OF COUNTRIES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.744" end="00:06:52.479">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW IT SEEMS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:54.948">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M A HOME BODY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.948" end="00:06:59.853">I&apos;D LIKE US TO STIFLE OUR OWN CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.522" end="00:07:05.659">IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE&apos;S A GLIMMER OF OPTIMISM IN YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.659" end="00:07:07.461">THERE&apos;S A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.</p>

<p begin="00:07:12.332" end="00:07:15.269">&gt;&gt; Jon: I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AS A BOOK TITLE.</p>
