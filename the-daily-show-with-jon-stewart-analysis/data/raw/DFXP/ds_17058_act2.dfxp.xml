<p begin="00:00:05.305" end="00:00:07.508">AS YOU KNOW, FEBRUARY IS BLACK HISTORY MONTH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.508" end="00:00:09.476">BUT SOME GROUPS... REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.476" end="00:00:09.776">WHOO?</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.776" end="00:00:10.177">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.177" end="00:00:15.115">SOME GROUPS DON&apos;T GET THEIR OWN MONTHS AND ACCORDING TO WYATT CENAC, THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.115" end="00:00:18.085">HE FILED THIS REPORT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.085" end="00:00:19.486">&gt;&gt; PITA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.486" end="00:00:25.292">MANY DISMISS THE ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP BECAUSE OF ITS PUBLICITY STUNTS AND GRATUITOUS USE OF NUDITY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.292" end="00:00:29.463">BUT WITH THEIR LATEST TACTIC THEY CAN FINALLY BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.463" end="00:00:32.132">&gt;&gt; PETA IS SUING THE WORLD ON BEHALF OF FIVE ORCAS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.132" end="00:00:37.304">&gt;&gt; THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS THAT THE ORCAS AT THE PARK ARE SLAVES AND SHOULD BE FREED UNDER THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:37.304" end="00:00:39.706">13th AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.706" end="00:00:40.207">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.207" end="00:00:47.481">FIVE OF SEAWORLD&apos;S ORCAS ARE SLAVES WHO NEED TO BE LIBERATED JUST AS AFRICAN SLAVES WERE IN </p>
<p begin="00:00:47.481" end="00:00:48.649">1865 BY THE 13th AMENDMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.649" end="00:00:50.317">&gt;&gt; THIS IS A GROUND-BREAKING LAWSUIT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.317" end="00:00:53.921">THE CONSTITUTION HAS NEVER BEEN APPLIED TO NONHUMAN ANIMALS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.921" end="00:00:59.426">WHAT WE WANT TO SEE FOR THESE ORCAS IS WE WANT TO SEE THEM RELEASED TO THEIR FREEDOM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.426" end="00:01:04.331">&gt;&gt; IT KIND OF REMAINS ME OF THE OLD ORCA SPIRITUAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.331" end="00:01:05.966">(SINGING LIKE A WHALE) </p>
<p begin="00:01:05.966" end="00:01:07.768">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.768" end="00:01:15.609">WELL, I GUESS... (SINGING LIKE A WHALE) (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.609" end="00:01:24.585">&gt;&gt; TO COMPARE THEIR CONDITIONS TO THIS INCREDIBLE HORROR OF SLAVERY IN AMERICA IS BEYOND INSULTING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.585" end="00:01:26.353">IT&apos;S A CRUEL AND RACIST JOKE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.353" end="00:01:30.357">&gt;&gt; ELAINE BROWN SPENT THE &apos;60s FIGHTING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.357" end="00:01:32.926">THE LEADER OF THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.926" end="00:01:37.197">YET SHE OF ALL PEOPLE REFUSES TO GET ON BOARD THE WHALE FREEDOM TRAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.197" end="00:01:38.966">&gt;&gt; IF THERE IS ANIMAL CRUELTY,</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.966" end="00:01:41.702">WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT CHECKING ANIMAL CRUELTY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.702" end="00:01:44.838">BUT ANIMAL CRUELTY DOES NOT RISE TO SLAVERY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.838" end="00:01:49.109">PART OF THE SLAVE CONDITION WAS THAT BLACKS WERE NOT REALLY HUMAN BEINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.109" end="00:01:49.843">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.843" end="00:01:51.612">JUST LIKE WHALES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.612" end="00:01:52.012">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:52.012" end="00:01:53.780">&gt;&gt; LET&apos;S NOT GET IT TWISTED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.780" end="00:01:58.852">&gt;&gt; BUT IMAGINE HAVING TO DO WHAT SLAVES DID BUT DOING IT UNDERWATER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.852" end="00:01:59.253">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:59.253" end="00:02:01.822">&gt;&gt; WELL, I&apos;M GOING TO LET YOU SLIDE ON THAT ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.822" end="00:02:04.057">THAT&apos;S PRETTY... THAT&apos;S PRETTY INSULTING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.057" end="00:02:05.058">&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.058" end="00:02:08.428">BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT EVEN ELAINE COULDN&apos;T DENY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.428" end="00:02:11.598">WE NEED TO BE MORE COMPASSIONATE TOWARD ANIMALS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.598" end="00:02:12.332">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.332" end="00:02:16.637">&gt;&gt; I MEAN, IT&apos;S NOT LIKE YOU&apos;RE JUST EXPLOITING THE HISTORY OF </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.637" end="00:02:22.543">THE ENSLAVEMENT OF BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR PUBLICITY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.543" end="00:02:22.876">RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.876" end="00:02:23.277">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:23.277" end="00:02:27.581">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO BE WISE WITH OUR DECISIONS AND WHAT LAWSUITS TO FILE AND THIS IS A </p>
<p begin="00:02:27.581" end="00:02:30.317">SMART ONE AND WE&apos;RE VERY HOPEFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.317" end="00:02:34.888">WE NEED TO USE EVERY MEANS AVAILABLE TO US TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.888" end="00:02:39.893">&gt;&gt; SO YOU&apos;RE THE FREEDOM RIDERS OF THE WHALE LIBERATION MOVEMENT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.893" end="00:02:44.665">&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT WE CAN CONSIDER PETA THE FREEDOM RIDERS OF THE WHALE LIBERATION MOVEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.665" end="00:02:47.601">&gt;&gt; THIS WOMAN IS BLIND TO THE ISSUES OF BLACK PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.601" end="00:02:54.741">&gt;&gt; SHE IS OUT THERE EVERYDAY ON THE FRONT LINES PUTTING UP ADS OF NAKED WHITE WOMEN ON BILLBOARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.741" end="00:02:57.644">&gt;&gt; SHE PHYSICALLY PUTTING THEM UP AND THEREFORE HER LIFE IS IN </p>
<p begin="00:02:57.644" end="00:02:59.913">JEOPARDY BECAUSE SHE&apos;S ON A LADDER IN A BILLBOARD?</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.913" end="00:03:01.448">&gt;&gt; OH, GOD, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.448" end="00:03:03.116">SHE&apos;S PROBABLY HIRING SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.116" end="00:03:06.186">&gt;&gt; SO I&apos;M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HER LIFE IS IN JEOPARDY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.186" end="00:03:10.057">&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO DEAL WITH PAM ANDERSON&apos;S MANAGER?</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.057" end="00:03:12.826">(LAUGHTER) THAT PERSON IS CRAZY!</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.826" end="00:03:15.195">&gt;&gt; YEAH, I FEEL HER PAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.195" end="00:03:19.566">&gt;&gt; ELAINE JUST COULDN&apos;T RECOGNIZE ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT LEGAL STRATEGIES OF </p>
<p begin="00:03:19.566" end="00:03:20.067">MODERN TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.067" end="00:03:23.237">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE 13th AMENDMENT DOESN&apos;T USE THE WORD </p>
<p begin="00:03:23.237" end="00:03:27.875">&quot;PERSON&quot; OR &quot;PEOPLE&quot; IN ITS LANGUAGE WE&apos;RE HOPING THAT A </p>
<p begin="00:03:27.875" end="00:03:30.677">COURT WILL SEE THAT IT CAN APPLY TO ANIMALS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.677" end="00:03:31.445">&gt;&gt; SHE WAS RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.445" end="00:03:34.248">IF THE CONSTITUTION WAS WRITTEN FOR PEOPLE AND NOT FOR WHALES,</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.248" end="00:03:36.517">IT WOULD STAY THAT SOMEWHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.517" end="00:03:40.153">BUT PETA KNOW THIS IS ISN&apos;T JUST ABOUT THE ORCAS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.153" end="00:03:42.789">&gt;&gt; YOU CAN&apos;T HELP BUT THINK BEYOND THIS CASE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.789" end="00:03:48.295">I THINK THIS CASE COULD BE GROUND BREAKING FOR ALL ANIMALS AND WE&apos;LL HOPEFULLY OPEN SOME </p>
<p begin="00:03:48.295" end="00:03:50.831">DOORS FOR A LOOK AT FUTURE LAWSUITS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.831" end="00:03:51.298">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.298" end="00:03:54.501">THIS WAS ABOUT ALL THE ANIMALS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.501" end="00:03:56.770">JUST LIKE IT SAID ON PETA&apos;S WEB SITE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.770" end="00:04:01.875">THE BIRD IN ITS CAGE, THE PIG IN ITS PEN, THE DOG IN ITS... WAIT,</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.875" end="00:04:04.678">WHAT THE (BLEEP)?</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.678" end="00:04:07.481">CAN YOU TELL ME WHO THIS IS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.481" end="00:04:11.451">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S... WELL, THAT&apos;S ME AND THAT&apos;S MY DOG.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.451" end="00:04:12.386">&gt;&gt; YOUR DOG?</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.386" end="00:04:13.320">&gt;&gt; SOPHIE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.320" end="00:04:14.288">&gt;&gt; SOPHIE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.288" end="00:04:16.857">IS THAT HER REAL NAME OR HER SLAVE NAME?</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.857" end="00:04:17.224">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:04:17.224" end="00:04:19.259">&gt;&gt; THAT IS THE NAME THAT I GAVE HER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.259" end="00:04:20.127">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE HER MASTER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.127" end="00:04:21.628">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M HER COMPANION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.628" end="00:04:24.064">&gt;&gt; WHY SHOULD YOU BE ALLOWED TO HAVE A PET?</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.064" end="00:04:27.634">&gt;&gt; SOPHIE IS A DOMESTIC ANIMAL AND NEEDS TO BE IN A HOME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.634" end="00:04:29.169">&gt;&gt; SHE STAYS IN A HOUSE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.169" end="00:04:31.572">THAT&apos;S NOT WHERE DOGS GO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.572" end="00:04:33.807">&gt;&gt; DOMESTIC ANIMALS DO...</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.807" end="00:04:36.276">&gt;&gt; DO YOU EVER PUT HER ON A LEASH?</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.276" end="00:04:38.712">&gt;&gt; FOR HER SAFETY I PUT MY DOG ON A LEASH...</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.712" end="00:04:40.981">&gt;&gt; THE LEASH IS FOR HER SAFE ANY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.981" end="00:04:45.552">&gt;&gt; FOR DOMESTIC DOGS AND CATS AND DEPENDING ON THE INDIVIDUAL THEIR NEEDS ARE VERY DIFFERENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.552" end="00:04:51.859">&gt;&gt; SO ORCAS ARE LIKE FIELD NIGGERS AND DOGS AND CATS ARE THE HOUSE NIGGERS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.859" end="00:04:56.763">(LAUGHTER) MAYBE LISA COULD LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHEN IT CAME TO HER DOG.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.763" end="00:05:01.735">BUT WHAT ABOUT THE COUNTLESS EXPLOITED CREATURES FEATURED IN PETA&apos;S CALENDARS AND POSTERS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.735" end="00:05:07.774">SOMEONE HAD TO ACT ON BEHALF OF THE ANIMALS SO I CALLED MY LAWYER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.774" end="00:05:10.110">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M HEREBY SERVING WITH YOU A COMPLAINT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.110" end="00:05:17.885">IT ALLEGES THAT PETA USES THE IMAGES OF SOME ANIMALS WITHOUT HAVING FIRST OBTAINED THEIR </p>

<p begin="00:05:20.821" end="00:05:25.726">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE BASICALLY BEING SERVED ON BEHALF OF ALL THE ANIMALS FOR </p>

<p begin="00:05:28.428" end="00:05:30.964">WHICH EVEN SHE ACKNOWLEDGES IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.964" end="00:05:32.299">&gt;&gt; WELL, YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.299" end="00:05:36.136">WHAT YOU&apos;RE DOING IS YOU&apos;RE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO THINK BEYOND THIS LAWSUIT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.136" end="00:05:37.204">IT&apos;S A GOOD THING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.204" end="00:05:42.809">&gt;&gt; AND IT TURNS OUT PETA WILL HAVE TO LOOK WELL BEYOND THEIR LAWSUIT SINCE A CALIFORNIA </p>
