<p begin="00:00:23.023" end="00:00:25.192">&gt;&gt; THAT WAS GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.192" end="00:00:26.026">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.026" end="00:00:27.294">&gt;&gt; CLOSE ENOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.294" end="00:00:28.295">&gt;&gt; Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.295" end="00:00:29.930">THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.930" end="00:00:31.732">SOLDIER DOG -- FIRST OF ALL,</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.732" end="00:00:34.101">KIND OF AN ADORABLE PICTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.101" end="00:00:42.376">BUT YOU REALLY DON&apos;T ACTUALLY HEAR -- DOGS HAVE QUITE AN IMPORTANT ROLE ON THE FRONTLINES </p>
<p begin="00:00:42.376" end="00:00:43.277">OF THE FIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.277" end="00:00:45.179">&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE A LOT OF ROLES ACTUALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.179" end="00:00:50.417">THE BIGGEST ONE RIGHT NOW IN AFGHANISTAN IS GOING OUT IN FRONT OF THE TROOPS AND SNIFFING </p>
<p begin="00:00:50.417" end="00:00:53.720">OUT IEDS AND THEY LEAD THE WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.720" end="00:00:57.991">THEY SAVE LIVES EVERY DAY BECAUSE THEIR NOSES ARE SO AMAZING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.991" end="00:01:00.460">SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.460" end="00:01:02.062">&gt;&gt; EACH ONE HAS A HANDLER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.062" end="00:01:07.201">EACH ONE HAS AN ASSIGNED INDIVIDUAL THAT TRAINS THEM OR JUST CARES FOR THEM?</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.201" end="00:01:09.069">&gt;&gt; THEY DON&apos;T TRAIN THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.069" end="00:01:15.209">THEY ARE TRAINED AT LACKLAND AIR FORCE BASE, MOST OF THEM, THEY GO THROUGH MONTHS OF TRAINING </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.209" end="00:01:18.545">ONCE THEY GET TO THE HOME BASE THEY MEET THE HANDLER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.545" end="00:01:23.250">THEY HANG OUT FOR MONTHS WITH THE HANDLER AND EVENTUALLY DEPLOY TOGETHER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.250" end="00:01:27.788">THEY GO THROUGH SEVEN MONTHS TOGETHER AND THEY COME BACK TOGETHER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.788" end="00:01:30.591">IT&apos;S A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.591" end="00:01:32.259">PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE LEFT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.259" end="00:01:32.759">THEY COME BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.759" end="00:01:35.162">THEY ARE -- </p>
<p begin="00:01:35.162" end="00:01:36.730">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY COME BACK WITH THE HANDLER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.730" end="00:01:38.532">THAT&apos;S A TRAINING EXERCISE, YES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.532" end="00:01:44.538">&gt;&gt; THAT SAY TRAINING EXERCISE AND THAT&apos;S MILITARY WORKING DOG </p>
<p begin="00:01:44.538" end="00:01:48.108">IN YUMA, ARRESTS, WHICH THEY CALL AFGHANISTAN U.S.A.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.108" end="00:01:50.244">YOU HAVE TO CARRY YOUR DOG.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.244" end="00:01:56.483">IF YOUR DOG IS INJURED AND YOU HAVE TO GO OVER A WALL AND YOUR DOG CAN&apos;T CLIMB A WALL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.483" end="00:02:00.053">IT&apos;S GOOD TO HAVE A SMALLER DOG THAN TINA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.053" end="00:02:02.089">&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE REALLY SMALL DOGS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.089" end="00:02:04.491">SHOW THE ONES IN THE SUBMARINES.</p>

<p begin="00:02:21.408" end="00:02:22.309">ACE BOMB SNIFFER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.309" end="00:02:27.848">HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A DRUG SNIFFER AND GOT INTO THE WRONG PROGRAM AT DOG SCHOOL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.848" end="00:02:32.386">HE SNIFFS OUT BOMBS AND SUBMARINES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.386" end="00:02:36.290">&gt;&gt; Jon: DOES THAT HAPPEN AT A LOT OF DOG SCHOOLS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.290" end="00:02:43.297">WAIT, I WAS A HELPER MONKEY NOW I&apos;M HERE IN A MINE -- I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.</p>

<p begin="00:02:59.012" end="00:03:00.180">YEAH, I HEARD OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.180" end="00:03:02.182">&gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE DOG IN THAT RAID.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.182" end="00:03:03.951">WE DON&apos;T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE DID.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.951" end="00:03:06.753">&gt;&gt; Jon: I HOPE HE URINATED ALL OVER THE PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.753" end="00:03:07.187">[ LAUGHTER ]</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.187" end="00:03:10.123">JUST TO ADD A LITTLE INSULT TO INJURY.</p>

<p begin="00:03:10.557" end="00:03:16.964">THESE DOGS, HOW DO THEY -- TRAIN THEM TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND -- THESE CONDITIONS IN AFGHANISTAN </p>
<p begin="00:03:16.964" end="00:03:21.835">ARE ABSOLUTELY SO DIFFICULT FOR EVEN HUMANS TO UNDERSTAND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.835" end="00:03:24.838">THEY GET PTSD?</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.838" end="00:03:27.241">HOW DOES A DOG NOT?</p>

<p begin="00:03:30.344" end="00:03:33.380">HOW DO THEY GET THE DOGS TO NOT RESPOND TO THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.380" end="00:03:35.382">OR DO THEY GET ISSUES?</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.382" end="00:03:40.153">&gt;&gt; THEY TRY TO BUY RESILIENT DOGS AND IT DOESN&apos;T ALWAYS HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.153" end="00:03:45.559">YOU DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT DOG IS GETTING PTSD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.559" end="00:03:48.195">THEY RECOGNIZED IT&apos;S REAL UNTIL DOGS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.195" end="00:03:55.469">THEY ARE DOING RESEARCH, DRUG THERAPY, BEHAVIORAL THERAPY BUT A QUARTER OF DOGS DIAGNOSED WILL </p>
