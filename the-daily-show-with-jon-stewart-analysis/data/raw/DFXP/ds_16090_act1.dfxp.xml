<p begin="00:02:34.721" end="00:02:38.192">THAT&apos;S ENDING A MEETING BY SCHEDULING NEXT MEETING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.192" end="00:02:44.164">AND I GOT TO SAY, IF THAT&apos;S OBAMA MAD, THAT&apos;S WEAK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.164" end="00:02:45.165">HE&apos;S STILL SO IN CONTROL.</p>

<p begin="00:03:12.192" end="00:03:17.064">THE IMMINENT POSSIBLE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OF OUR COUNTRY IS A CHIP THE PRESIDENT WILL PLAY OR </p>
<p begin="00:03:17.064" end="00:03:19.433">NOT PLAY GIVEN THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF HIS HAND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.433" end="00:03:22.603">AND SECOND, I THINK WHEN YOU&apos;RE PLAYING THAT HAND, YOU&apos;RE NOT </p>
<p begin="00:03:22.603" end="00:03:26.273">SUPPOSED TO TELL THE OTHER GUY IT&apos;S A BLUFF.</p>

<p begin="00:03:51.532" end="00:03:55.869">YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT ISN&apos;T ALONE IN ESCALATING THE RHETORIC IN THIS FIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.869" end="00:03:58.105">CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN HAD SOME HARSH WORDS OF HER OWN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.105" end="00:04:02.042">&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT DOESN&apos;T WANT TO HAVE TO BE CONFRONTED WITH </p>
<p begin="00:04:02.042" end="00:04:07.748">PRIORITIES IN SPENDING BECAUSE HE HAS A LOT OF CHOOTS-PAH.</p>

<p begin="00:04:26.433" end="00:04:29.069">MORE GRANDMOTHERS THAN OBAMA CUTTING OFF THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.069" end="00:04:37.311">I THINK BOTH PARTIES HAVE ALREADY LOST FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.311" end="00:04:46.920">&quot;CHOOTS-PAH.&quot; SOUNDS LIKE SHE&apos;S TALKING OUT OF HER CHOOTCHAS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.920" end="00:04:51.625">HERE&apos;S SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL LAYING OUT HIS PLAN FOR THE DEBT CRISIS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.625" end="00:04:55.796">&gt;&gt; I WOULD ADVOCATE THAT WE PASSES LEGISLATION GIVING THE PRESIDENT THE AUTHORITY TO </p>
<p begin="00:04:55.796" end="00:05:05.239">REQUEST OF US AN INCREASE IN THE DEBT CEILING THAT WOULD TAKE US PAST THE END OF HIS TERM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.239" end="00:05:09.710">&gt;&gt; Jon: [WHISPERING]: HEAP THREAT CAL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.710" end="00:05:12.913">&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.913" end="00:05:16.416">THAT RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL IF PASSED WOULD THEN GO TO THE PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.416" end="00:05:18.719">HE COULD SIGN IT OR HE COULD VETO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.719" end="00:05:20.821">&gt;&gt; Jon: WAIT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.821" end="00:05:21.154">WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.154" end="00:05:22.689">SEE WHAT McCONNELL DID?</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.689" end="00:05:29.196">HE CLEVERLY SPLIT THE SENATE&apos;S RESPONSIBILITY IN TWO,</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.196" end="00:05:33.400">ADVOCATING THE UNPOPULAR DOING IT PART TO THE PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:34.535">WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.535" end="00:05:38.338">IF RAISING THE DEBT LIMIT IS THE RESPONSIBLE CHOICE, WHY ARE YOU ALLOWING THE PRESIDENT TO DO IT </p>
<p begin="00:05:38.338" end="00:05:41.308">WHILE WIPING OFF ANY OF YOUR FINGER AND FOOTPRINTS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.308" end="00:05:48.882">&gt;&gt; THE REASON DEFAULT IS NO BETTER IDEA TODAY THAN WHEN NEWT GINGRICH TRIED IT IN 1995 IS IT </p>
<p begin="00:05:48.882" end="00:05:53.287">DESTROYS YOUR BRAND AND WOULD GIVE THE PRESIDENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO BLAME REPUBLICANS </p>
<p begin="00:05:53.287" end="00:05:54.254">FOR BAD ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.254" end="00:05:56.290">LOOK, HE OWNS THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.290" end="00:05:59.660">HE&apos;S BEEN IN OFFICE ALMOST THREE YEARS NOW, AND WE REFUSE TO LET </p>

<p begin="00:06:14.208" end="00:06:22.883">IT&apos;S LIKE WHEN THE PINTO PEOPLE WERE UPSET THE EXPLODING GAS CANS WERE SINGEING THE HORSE MA DANAL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.883" end="00:06:26.086">I FIND McCONNELL&apos;S HONEST DISHONESTY REFRESHING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.086" end="00:06:29.656">HE&apos;S LAYING OUT THE CYNICAL STRATEGIC SUBTEXT THAT WE&apos;RE NOT </p>

<p begin="00:06:44.271" end="00:06:51.712">SO THE OUTSIDE OBSERVER, OUR LEADERS&apos; INABILITY TO COMPROMISE ON EVEN THE SMALLEST THINGS </p>
<p begin="00:06:51.712" end="00:06:58.318">SEEMS INEXPLICABLE, BUT WATCH AS SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL EXPLAINS WASHINGTON MAGIC TO THE MUGGLES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.318" end="00:07:02.256">&gt;&gt; YOU SAID, &quot;THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE WANT TO ACHIEVE IS FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA </p>
<p begin="00:07:02.256" end="00:07:03.790">TO BE A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:07:03.790" end="00:07:05.158">&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT IS TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.158" end="00:07:08.729">THAT&apos;S MY SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL GOAL.</p>
