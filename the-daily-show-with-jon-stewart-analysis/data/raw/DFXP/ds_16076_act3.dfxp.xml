<p begin="00:00:06.139" end="00:00:08.509">MY GUEST TONIGHT AN AUTHOR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.509" end="00:00:10.978">HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE RIPPLE EFFECT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.978" end="00:00:14.348">THE FATE OF FRESH WATER IN THE 21st CENTURY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.348" end="00:00:18.752">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW ALEX PRUD&apos;HOMME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.752" end="00:00:19.786">NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.786" end="00:00:25.559">HOW ARE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.559" end="00:00:26.927">THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.927" end="00:00:28.629">&gt;&gt; MY PLEASURE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.629" end="00:00:30.330">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A FINE TIME TONIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.330" end="00:00:35.369">WE SHARED MANY LAUGHS AND NOW A WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL US HOW THE HUMAN RACE WILL END.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.369" end="00:00:36.737">&gt;&gt; IT IS THE RIP REL EFFECT,</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.737" end="00:00:39.173">THE FATE OF FRESH WATER IN THE 21st CENTURY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.173" end="00:00:42.776">THE FATE OF FRESH WATER IN THE 21st CENTURY, SIR,</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.776" end="00:00:45.979">ACCORDING TO YOUR BOOK, IT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.979" end="00:00:47.414">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.414" end="00:00:55.589">BETWEEN DROUGHT, FLOOD AND SELF-POISONING, I THINK THE HUMAN RACE IS IN FOR A TOUGH TIME WATERWISE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.589" end="00:00:55.956">&gt;&gt; Jon: .</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.956" end="00:00:57.224">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THE BAD NEWS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.224" end="00:01:01.061">&gt;&gt; NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.061" end="00:01:09.169">(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:01:09.169" end="00:01:10.871">&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS NOT HORDING,</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.871" end="00:01:12.272">I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.272" end="00:01:16.310">IF YOU ARE IN TROUBLE, YOU MAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.310" end="00:01:18.979">BUT FOR NOW, TO BE SAFE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.979" end="00:01:21.081">WHAT IS THE GREATEST THREAT,</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.081" end="00:01:26.119">IS IT THAT WE ARE POLLUTING OUR OWN OR THAT WE ARE OVERPOPULATING WHAT EXISTS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.119" end="00:01:32.226">&gt;&gt; ALL OF THE ABOVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.226" end="00:01:33.927">NO, HERE&apos;S THE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.927" end="00:01:39.099">40 YEARS AFTER THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT, THE FOUNDING OF </p>
<p begin="00:01:39.099" end="00:01:46.240">THE EPA, THE FACT IS THAT OUR WATER IS ACTUALLY GETTING DIRTIER RATHER THAN CLEANER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:50.344">AND REGULATIONS AREN&apos;T KEEPING UP WITH NEW TYPES OF POLLUTANTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.344" end="00:01:54.114">THE EPA IS UNDER ATTACK IN CONGRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.114" end="00:01:57.484">AND POLLUTERS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.484" end="00:02:00.888">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT COULDN&apos;T YOU SAY THEN IN THE 50s AND 670s THEY WOULD SAY WELL, LOOK AT </p>
<p begin="00:02:00.888" end="00:02:02.589">OUR WATERS, YOU CAN LIGHT THEM ON FIRE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.589" end="00:02:06.727">THERE ARE CAR SEN GENICS IN THERE AND WE DID SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.727" end="00:02:11.098">WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT WE WON&apos;T-- CLEAN SOME OF THESE NEW POLLUTANTS OUT AND </p>
<p begin="00:02:11.098" end="00:02:11.832">WHAT ARE THEY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.832" end="00:02:15.936">AND MAYBE WE DISCOVER THAT THEY ACTUALLY CURE CANCER?</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.936" end="00:02:17.638">&gt;&gt; WHERE DO I BEGIN, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.638" end="00:02:19.673">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:19.673" end="00:02:21.875">&gt;&gt; Jon: START WITH ALL THE THINGS I GOT WRONG.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.875" end="00:02:26.213">&gt;&gt; WELL, THE REASON FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT OF THE LATE 60s AND EARLY 70s </p>
<p begin="00:02:26.213" end="00:02:33.086">WAS BECAUSE THE CUYAHOGA RIVER IGNITED ON FIRE BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY POLLUTANTS IN IT AND THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:33.086" end="00:02:36.423">POISONING AT LOVE CANAL AND THAT WAS AN IMPETUS FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.423" end="00:02:40.160">AND THERE WERE SOME WONDERFUL REGULATIONS AND LAWS PUT INTO EFFECT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:42.596">THE PROBLEM IS THAT BEING AMERICANS WE SAID OKAY, DONE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.596" end="00:02:43.430">FINISHED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.430" end="00:02:44.298">WE&apos;RE OUT OF THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.298" end="00:02:45.999">AND THAT WAS 40 YEARS AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.999" end="00:02:52.472">AND WE HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT ACTUALLY CHEMICAL COMPANIES KEEP PRODUCING NEW CHEMICALS EVERY YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.472" end="00:02:57.978">PEOPLE FIND SNEAKY WAYS OF GETTING COW MANURE INTO OUR WELLS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.978" end="00:03:01.048">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT SEEMS VERY SPECIFIC.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.048" end="00:03:01.748">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.748" end="00:03:05.485">&gt;&gt; Jon: LIKE YOU&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT CHEMICALS AN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY&apos;RE PUTTING COW </p>
<p begin="00:03:05.485" end="00:03:06.820">POOP IN OUR WELLS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.820" end="00:03:09.489">&gt;&gt; READ THE BOOK, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.489" end="00:03:09.890">YES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.890" end="00:03:12.893">AND SO WE HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE POLLUTANTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.893" end="00:03:15.262">AND SO THAT&apos;S ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.262" end="00:03:19.733">&gt;&gt; Jon: JUST IN AMERICA OR A WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON BECAUSE IF IT&apos;S NOT A WORLDWIDE </p>
<p begin="00:03:19.733" end="00:03:27.574">PHENOMENON, CAN&apos;T WE ATTACK OTHER COUNTRIES WHOSE WATER IS CLEANER AND DRINK THEIR </p>
<p begin="00:03:27.574" end="00:03:29.276">MILK SHAKE, AS IT WERE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.276" end="00:03:31.645">&gt;&gt; LIKE DANIEL PLAINVIEW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.645" end="00:03:32.880">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHAT I AM SAYING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.880" end="00:03:35.082">&gt;&gt; IT IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.082" end="00:03:39.586">AND THERE ARE LEGACY POLLUTANTS WHICH ARE THE OLD POLLUTANTS SITTING IN THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:39.586" end="00:03:43.457">ENVIRONMENT FOR DECADES SUCH AS PCPs IN THE HUDSON RIVER DOWN THE STREET.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.457" end="00:03:49.429">AND THEN THERE ARE NEW POLLUTANTS LIKE SYNTHETIC ESTROGEN AND NARCOTICS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.429" end="00:03:52.566">AND-- THE 600 NEW CHEMICALS THAT COME OUT EVERY YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.566" end="00:03:56.103">&gt;&gt; Jon: IF SEEMS LIKE SUCH A DIFFERENT LIKE OH MY GOD WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE TRIPPING </p>
<p begin="00:03:56.103" end="00:04:01.175">AND WE WON&apos;T BE ABLE TO TELL IF WE ARE TRIPPING AND WE ALL HAVE BREASTS OR IF IT IS </p>
<p begin="00:04:01.175" end="00:04:02.109">JUST, YOU KNOW -- </p>
<p begin="00:04:02.109" end="00:04:03.944">&gt;&gt; MAYBE IT&apos;S A GOOD THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.944" end="00:04:05.879">&gt;&gt; Jon: MAYBE IT&apos;S A GOOD THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.879" end="00:04:06.680">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:04:06.680" end="00:04:10.651">&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO TURN NONPOTABLE SOURCES INTO </p>
<p begin="00:04:10.651" end="00:04:14.521">POTABLE SOURCES, SEAWATER,</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.521" end="00:04:16.190">WASTE, HUMAN SEWAGE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.190" end="00:04:17.824">&gt;&gt; YES, INDEED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.824" end="00:04:18.492">WE&apos;VE STARTED THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.492" end="00:04:21.562">DESAL INATION IS THE PROCESS OF TAKING THE SALT OUT OF SEAWATER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.562" end="00:04:24.331">THE PROBLEM WITH W IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.331" end="00:04:26.300">IT REQUIRES A LOT OF POWER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.300" end="00:04:30.070">WHICH CREATES MORE GREENHOUSE GASES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.070" end="00:04:32.773">YOU TAKE THE SALT OUT AND WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE SALT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.773" end="00:04:34.141">THEY&apos;RE VERY CONCENTRATED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.141" end="00:04:37.544">WHEN YOU PUT THEM BACK INTO THE OCEAN WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE LIKE TO DO, IT KILLS </p>
<p begin="00:04:37.544" end="00:04:39.179">SOME OF THE MARINE LIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.179" end="00:04:45.118">SO DESAL IS A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX BUT IT&apos;S NOT THE ANSWER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.118" end="00:04:47.788">RECYCLING SEWAGE IS ACTUALLY A VERY INTERESTING IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.788" end="00:04:50.290">IT STARTED TO HAPPEN MORE AND MORE NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.290" end="00:04:56.296">THERE IS OBVIOUS REACTION TO THIS A YUCK FACTOR THAT PEOPLE CAN&apos;T STAND-- .</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.296" end="00:04:59.399">&gt;&gt; Jon: REALLY, DRINKING OUR EVEN URINE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.399" end="00:04:59.800">&gt;&gt; SHOCKING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.800" end="00:05:01.602">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU GET A YUCK FACTOR ON THAT ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.602" end="00:05:02.936">&gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT, LITTLE BIT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.936" end="00:05:08.308">BUT IN ORANGE COUNTY THEY BUILT A GIANT NEW PLANT THAT IS PRODUCING ULTRA PURE WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.308" end="00:05:13.180">WHICH THEY THEN PUT BACK IN AND MIX WITH NATURAL SUPPLIES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.180" end="00:05:15.682">AND EVENTUALLY ENDS UP IN,</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.682" end="00:05:17.351">OVER 2 MILLION TAPS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.351" end="00:05:18.685">AND SO FAR NO PROBLEMS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.685" end="00:05:22.055">AND THIS IS THE KIND OF THING WE&apos;RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.055" end="00:05:26.927">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE LOOKING AT ME LIKE-- I&apos;M NEVER MOVING THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.927" end="00:05:27.294">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.294" end="00:05:28.962">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.962" end="00:05:37.104">ANYBODY AT HOME, IF ARE YOU HAVING A PARTY AND YOU WANT TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD, GET THE RIPPLE EFFECT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.104" end="00:05:38.472">INVITE THEM OVERMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.472" end="00:05:39.840">IT&apos;S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.</p>
