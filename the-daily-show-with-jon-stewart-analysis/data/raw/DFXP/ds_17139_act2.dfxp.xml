<p begin="00:00:12.279" end="00:00:21.989">BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS DEMAND ON TWITTER AND SOCIAL MEDIA FOR MORE VICE PRESIDENT JOKES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.989" end="00:00:29.930">AS WE&apos;VE SEEN, MITT ROMNEY&apos;S CHOICE OF PAUL RYAN FOR HIS RUNNING MATE HAS THRILLED REPUBLICANS.</p>

<p begin="00:00:38.772" end="00:00:43.277">PUTTING PAUL RYAN ON THE PRESIDENTIAL TICKET IS A DISASTER FOR MITT ROMNEY&apos;S CAMPAIGN </p>
<p begin="00:00:43.277" end="00:00:46.213">&gt;&gt; I DID TALK TO THE HOUSE DEMOCRAT CAMPAIGN ARM YESTERDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.213" end="00:00:48.415">THE MAN WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE RYAN PICK </p>
<p begin="00:00:48.415" end="00:00:54.655">&gt;&gt; HE IS A RIGHT WING IDEOLOGUE I HAVE HEARD VERY FEW BAD THIMTION AS A HUMAN BEING OTHER </p>

<p begin="00:01:19.880" end="00:01:22.716">&gt;&gt; AND I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT PAUL RYAN AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.716" end="00:01:26.887">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW CAN BOTH SIDES BE BOTH EQUALLY EXCITED?</p>

<p begin="00:01:39.433" end="00:01:44.137">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU KNOW YOU BOTH SAID THE EXACT SAME THING JUST WITH DIFFERENT INTONATIONS </p>
<p begin="00:01:44.137" end="00:01:44.738">&gt;&gt; WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.738" end="00:01:45.272">NO.</p>
