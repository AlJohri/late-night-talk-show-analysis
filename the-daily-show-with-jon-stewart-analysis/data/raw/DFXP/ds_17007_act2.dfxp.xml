<p begin="00:00:11.245" end="00:00:15.816">THE G.O.P. NOMINATION, OPENING UP THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY THAT THE 2012 ELECTION COULD BE </p>
<p begin="00:00:15.816" end="00:00:18.485">A CONTEST BETWEEN TO AFRICAN AMERICANS.</p>

<p begin="00:00:31.198" end="00:00:32.332">PEOPLE WOULD LET THAT HAPPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.332" end="00:00:34.868">THEY&apos;RE NOT CRAZY ABOUT CAIN&apos;S POLITICS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.868" end="00:00:37.171">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY WOULDN&apos;T LET IT HAPPEN?</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.171" end="00:00:41.875">&gt;&gt; WELL, EVEN IF HERMAN CAIN GETS THE NOMINATION, IT TECHNICALLY WON&apos;T BE TWO BLACK </p>
<p begin="00:00:41.875" end="00:00:48.115">GUYS RUNNING BECAUSE BLACK PEOPLE WILL DECERTIFY HIM.</p>

<p begin="00:01:07.534" end="00:01:11.839">IT&apos;S YOUR PROOF YOU&apos;RE 100% AUTHENTIC AMERICAN BLACK PERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.839" end="00:01:13.841">AND, YES, IT CAN BE TAKEN AWAY,</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.613" end="00:01:20.314">BY WHOM?</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.314" end="00:01:24.151">&gt;&gt; ANYONE MORE AUTHENTICALLY BLACK THAN YOU.</p>

<p begin="00:01:34.995" end="00:01:36.730">&gt;&gt; GOOD FORTUNE.</p>

<p begin="00:01:46.573" end="00:01:48.308">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A VERY CATCHY SONG.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.308" end="00:01:50.677">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S ABOUT COUNTING BANANAS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.677" end="00:01:53.180">JON.</p>

<p begin="00:01:54.214" end="00:02:00.420">&gt;&gt; WELL, THEN A TARANTULA GETS INTO THE BANANAS AND HE&apos;S WAITING IF FOR TALLY MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:01.788">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, NOT IN THE SONG.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.788" end="00:02:06.193">WHAT IS THE NEXT PART ABOUT REVOKING HERMAN CAIN&apos;S BLACK CARD?</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.193" end="00:02:07.261">&gt;&gt; RIGHT, GUILT BY ASSOCIATION.</p>

<p begin="00:02:26.079" end="00:02:30.951">&gt;&gt; SO HE&apos;S SAYING COLIN POWELL IS NOT A BLACK HERO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.951" end="00:02:32.553">&gt;&gt; OF COURSE NOT, SILLY.</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.260" end="00:02:42.095">&gt;&gt; OH, NO, NO, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.095" end="00:02:43.263">IT GOES BOTH WAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.263" end="00:02:44.998">HERMAN CAIN IS DOING IT, TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.998" end="00:02:50.704">&gt;&gt; HOW WOULD YOU FARE ON A STAINING YOU AND BARACK OBAMA IN A DEBATE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.704" end="00:02:52.940">&gt;&gt; IT WOULD ALMOST BE NO CONTEST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.940" end="00:02:55.175">HE&apos;S NEVER BEEN A PART OF THE BLACK EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.175" end="00:02:56.310">I CAN TALK ABOUT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.310" end="00:03:02.449">I CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANT TO BE POOR BEFORE I WAS POOR.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.449" end="00:03:05.085">HE CAN&apos;T.</p>

<p begin="00:03:06.620" end="00:03:11.658">&gt;&gt; JON, IF THIS KEEPS UP, THE RACE WILL ONCE AGAIN BE DOWN TO TWO WHITE GUYS.</p>

<p begin="00:03:12.059" end="00:03:14.561">AND THERE THIS ALL COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.561" end="00:03:20.467">IF HERMAN CAIN DIDN&apos;T OPEN HIS MOUTH ABOUT RACISM, THE BLACK RESPONSE WAS IMMEDIATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.467" end="00:03:24.438">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T BELIEVE RACISM HOLDS ANYBODY BACK IN A BIG WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.438" end="00:03:28.709">&gt;&gt; HE NEEDS TO GET OFF THE SYMBOLIC CRACK PIPE.</p>
