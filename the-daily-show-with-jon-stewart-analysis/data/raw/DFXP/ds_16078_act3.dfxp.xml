<p begin="00:02:07.794" end="00:02:15.302">&gt;&gt; IT WAS PRETTY GREAT BECAUSE FOR A SOUTH PARK MOVIE, I LOST THE OSCAR TO PHIL COLLINS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.302" end="00:02:22.109">SO IF I LOSE AN OSCAR TO PHIL COLLINS AND I LOSE THE ONY TO BONO, I WOULD BE SO BUMMED OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.109" end="00:02:26.747">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN WE DOING THE </p>

<p begin="00:02:44.331" end="00:02:48.101">YOU GET TO SAY, NO, IT&apos;S NOT OPEN.</p>
