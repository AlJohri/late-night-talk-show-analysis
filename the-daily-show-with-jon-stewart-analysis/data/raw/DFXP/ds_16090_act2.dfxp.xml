<p begin="00:00:04.771" end="00:00:09.643">SO LAST FRIDAY THE FINAL LAUNCH OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE WAS LAST FRIDAY, A STIRRING EVENT THAT </p>
<p begin="00:00:09.643" end="00:00:15.415">CREATED EVEN MORE UNEMPLOYMENT WITH SWARMS OF JOBLESS ASTRONAUTS NOW FLOODING THE JOB MARKET.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.415" end="00:00:18.519">JOHN OLIVER WAS AT CAPE CANAVERAL TO WITNESS THE END OF AN ERA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.519" end="00:00:22.389">&gt;&gt; AMERICA&apos;S SPACE PROGRAM WAS OUR CROWNING GLORY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.389" end="00:00:30.931">IT WAS A MEASURE OF WHO WE WERE AS A PEOPLE, A TIME WHEN WE EXPLORED A NEW WORLD,</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.931" end="00:00:36.203">ILLUMINATED OUR BREATHTAKING UNIVERSE, AND WE DID THESE THINGS IN THE IMMORTAL WORDS OF </p>
<p begin="00:00:36.203" end="00:00:37.471">JOHN F. KENDY...</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.471" end="00:00:40.641">&gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.641" end="00:00:45.145">&gt;&gt; ALL OF THIS IS NOW OVER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.145" end="00:00:48.949">AND WHERE BETTER FOR ME TO GO THAN FLORIDA TO WATCH SOMETHING DIE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.949" end="00:00:50.017">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A LITTLE SAD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.017" end="00:00:52.019">THIS IS REALLY THE END OF AN ERA.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.019" end="00:00:54.188">&gt;&gt; HAPPY THAT I GOT TO SEE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.188" end="00:00:55.956">SAD THAT THERE&apos;S GOING TO BE NONE AFTER THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.956" end="00:00:58.559">&gt;&gt; TOO BAD I WON&apos;T BE ABLE TO SEE IT AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:00.527">&gt;&gt; IT WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US IN A WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.527" end="00:01:01.295">&gt;&gt; WILL IT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.295" end="00:01:02.729">&gt;&gt; NO, NOT THE SHUTTLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.729" end="00:01:05.265">THAT WILL PROBABLY GET MELTED DOWN FOR SCRAP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.265" end="00:01:08.602">I MEAN THE MEMORY OF WHEN AMERICA HAD HOPES AND DREAMS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.602" end="00:01:11.438">WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.438" end="00:01:14.308">DON&apos;T SAY ASTRONAUT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.308" end="00:01:16.443">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.443" end="00:01:18.278">WERE YOU GOING TO SAY ASTRONAUT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.278" end="00:01:18.612">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.612" end="00:01:20.447">&gt;&gt; I COULD SEE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.447" end="00:01:23.116">AMERICA&apos;S SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM WAS IN ITS FINAL COUNTDOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.116" end="00:01:26.086">AND I COULDN&apos;T WAIT TO BE A PART OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.086" end="00:01:33.093">I&apos;M HERE AT CAPE CA KNAVE RAL FOR A SEMINOLE MOMENT IN HISTORY WHEN AMERICA LOOKS TO ITS </p>
<p begin="00:01:33.093" end="00:01:36.630">HIGHEST ASPIRATIONS AND SAID,</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:37.865">EH, [BLEEPED] IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.865" end="00:01:43.170">THE SPACE PROGRAM HAD ONCE BEEN PILOTED BY MEN WHO WERE INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTARS, NAMES </p>
<p begin="00:01:43.170" end="00:01:45.973">LIKE JOHN GLENN, NEIL ARMSTRONG,</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.973" end="00:01:46.573">JIM LOVELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.573" end="00:01:48.242">&gt;&gt; HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.242" end="00:01:51.745">&gt;&gt; APPARENTLY THEY EVEN EXISTED IN REAL LIFE, TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.745" end="00:01:56.216">I SAT DOWN WITH APOLLO 13&apos;S JIM LOVELL, A TRUE AMERICAN HERO,</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.216" end="00:02:00.554">WHO WOULD NEVER GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.554" end="00:02:03.090">THIS CONVERSATION WASN&apos;T GOING TO BE EASY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.090" end="00:02:06.627">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M JUST GOING TO STOP THAT MUSIC.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.627" end="00:02:07.261">RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.261" end="00:02:11.665">IT&apos;S GOING TO MAKE THIS MORE DIFFICULT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.665" end="00:02:17.871">SO, JIM, LISTEN, IT&apos;S OVER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.871" end="00:02:19.806">&gt;&gt; I NEVER SAY THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.806" end="00:02:23.911">IT IS MUCH EASIER IF WE JUST SAID, WHY DON&apos;T WE LET SOMEONE ELSE DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.911" end="00:02:25.445">I&apos;LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.445" end="00:02:29.583">INDIA IS LOOKING AT THE ADVANTAGES OF SPACE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.583" end="00:02:33.420">&gt;&gt; SO WE&apos;RE GOING TO OUTSOURCE OUR HOPES AND DREAMS TO INDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.420" end="00:02:35.355">&gt;&gt; WE MIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.355" end="00:02:41.662">BUT IS THAT THE MODUS OPERANDI OF THE UNITED STATES?</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.662" end="00:02:42.329">NO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.329" end="00:02:47.835">THE NEW GENERATION SHOULD GET THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT THE OLD GENERATION GOT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.835" end="00:02:50.571">WE ORBITED THE MOON FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.571" end="00:03:01.481">WE SAW THE EARTH AS IT REALLY IS, JUST A SMALL BLUE AND WHITE BODY TUCKED AWAY IN THE VASTNESS </p>
<p begin="00:03:01.481" end="00:03:02.049">OF SPACE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.049" end="00:03:08.388">I COULD PUT UP MY THUMB AND COMPLETELY HIDE EVERYTHING THAT I&apos;VE EVER KNOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.388" end="00:03:21.969">THAT PHOTOGRAPH TELLS IN JUST ONE PICTURE REALLY THE EXISTENCE THAT WE HAVE HERE ON EARTH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.969" end="00:03:22.736">&gt;&gt; WOW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.736" end="00:03:24.304">THAT&apos;S INCREDIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.304" end="00:03:26.406">I&apos;VE ACTUALLY GOT AN AMAZING PHOTOGRAPH, AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.406" end="00:03:28.175">I GOT TO SHOW YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.175" end="00:03:30.644">LOOK, IT&apos;S ME AND PEE WEE HERMAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.644" end="00:03:31.078">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.078" end="00:03:31.745">&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.745" end="00:03:34.715">&gt;&gt; ISN&apos;T THAT INCREDIBLE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.715" end="00:03:39.386">DO -- YOU THINK, I CAN&apos;T BEREAVE WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.386" end="00:03:47.861">AS THE SHUTTLE PREPARED FOR ITS LAST LAUNCH AND THE CROWD BRACED THEMSELVES FOR A FINAL WAVE </p>
<p begin="00:03:47.861" end="00:03:51.932">GOOD-BYE, THIS AMERICAN ICON LEFT THE EARTH, NOT WITH A BANG,</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.932" end="00:03:58.539">BUT WITH A WHOA, WOW, HOLY CRAP THAT IS LOUD, WOW.</p>

<p begin="00:04:00.340" end="00:04:07.481">I&apos;VE GOT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.481" end="00:04:10.684">A WEEK AFTER THIS HAPPENED I&apos;M STILL GETTING GOOSE BUMPS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.684" end="00:04:11.084">WOW THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.084" end="00:04:15.055">IS THE SINGLE MOST AMAZING THING I&apos;VE EVER WITNESSED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.055" end="00:04:17.925">GO, GO, FLY!</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.925" end="00:04:19.226">WE HAVE TO DO THAT AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.226" end="00:04:21.595">WE HAVE TO DO THAT AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.595" end="00:04:24.598">WHEN ARE WE DOING THAT AGAIN?</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.598" end="00:04:27.201">WHAT DO YOU MEAN NEVER?</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.201" end="00:04:27.701">OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.701" end="00:04:31.805">SO THAT WAS OBJECTIVELY INCREDIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.805" end="00:04:36.743">BUT WHO IS GOING TO CONVINCE AMERICA THAT THIS IS STILL WORTH DOING?</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.743" end="00:04:41.682">&gt;&gt; JOHN, PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN GOALS, CERTAIN THINGS TO </p>
<p begin="00:04:41.682" end="00:04:45.319">STRIVE FOR, THINGS THEY CAN LOOK UP TO AND SAY, HEY, IT DID THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.319" end="00:04:49.656">TO GIVE UP ON THAT CREAM -- DREAM IS TO GIVE UP ON AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.656" end="00:04:53.093">&gt;&gt; YEAH, I GUESS.</p>

<p begin="00:05:02.069" end="00:05:11.745">&gt;&gt; ALL PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE CERTAIN GOALS, SOMETHING TO STRIVE FOR, AND IN DOING SO, WE </p>
<p begin="00:05:11.745" end="00:05:17.918">REACHED BEYOND OURSELVES TO ACHIEVE THAT WHICH WE DID NOT THINK WAS POSSIBLE, TO GIVE UP </p>
<p begin="00:05:17.918" end="00:05:29.863">ON THAT DREAM IS TO GIVE UP ON AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.863" end="00:05:31.098">&gt;&gt; IT WAS BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.098" end="00:05:32.933">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT WAS PRETTY GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.933" end="00:05:35.068">&gt;&gt; I KNOW, DO FORRSET GUMP.</p>
