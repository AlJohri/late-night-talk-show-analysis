<p begin="00:00:18.318" end="00:00:22.723">I LOVED THEM BUT I&apos;M ALSO AFRAID OF THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.723" end="00:00:26.393">IT&apos;S APPROPRIATE TO BE AFRAID OF THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.393" end="00:00:30.063">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.063" end="00:00:30.864">&gt;&gt; HE&apos;S HAPPY.</p>

<p begin="00:01:03.430" end="00:01:05.699">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE CHIMP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.699" end="00:01:10.637">I ROLLED AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT AND THEY SAID TOO MARSUPIAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.637" end="00:01:13.307">&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT IT WAS JAMES FRANCO&apos;S ROLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.307" end="00:01:17.411">&gt;&gt; Jon: THERE&apos;S VERY LITTLE THAT FRANCO AND I WOULD BE IN THE SAME ROOM FOR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.411" end="00:01:17.845">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.845" end="00:01:20.247">THAT IS NOT AN ACTUAL CHIMP IN THAT SCENE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.247" end="00:01:26.453">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S ANDY -- THAT&apos;S WHY I DIDN&apos;T GET THE ROLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.453" end="00:01:28.222">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S A GUY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.222" end="00:01:36.630">&gt;&gt; THE AMAZING ACTOR WHO DID LORD OF RINGS AND KING KONG.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:39.333">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S INCREDIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.333" end="00:01:43.770">HAS HE EVER BEEN IN ANYTHING WHERE HE IS NOT HIDEOUSLY DEFORMED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:46.807">&gt;&gt; HE&apos;S DONE QUITE A BIT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.807" end="00:01:52.946">WE SAW A CLIP OF HIM IN 13 GOING ON 30 DOING A DANCE MOVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.946" end="00:01:54.281">DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.281" end="00:01:56.416">&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.416" end="00:01:57.417">NOBODY SAW THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.417" end="00:01:57.818">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.818" end="00:01:59.786">THEY ARE ALL GOING TO RENT IT TONIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.786" end="00:02:02.289">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.289" end="00:02:03.490">AS IT WAS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.490" end="00:02:08.929">IS IT DIFFICULT -- SO IS ANDY CIRCUS IN THAT MOMENT IS HE DRESSED LIKE A CHIMP?</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.929" end="00:02:16.637">&gt;&gt; HE IS A GRAY MOTION CAPTURE SUIT WHICH YOU SAW IN AVATAR AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.637" end="00:02:20.340">HE HAS ALL THESE DOTS AND A CAMERA ON HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:26.647">WHAT IS AMAZING IS NOT HAVING A REAL APE WHO CANNOT EMOTE THE WAY ANDY CAN BECAUSE HE IS HUMAN </p>
<p begin="00:02:26.647" end="00:02:30.584">AND TRAINED TO DO THAT AND HE&apos;S SPECIFICALLY TRAINED -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:30.584" end="00:02:39.726">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION AS AN ACTOR, HOW BIG A COMPLIMENT IS:  YOUR BETTER THAN </p>
<p begin="00:02:39.726" end="00:02:40.627">AND APE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.627" end="00:02:43.497">IS THAT CONSIDERATE IN SOME WAY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.497" end="00:02:48.936">&gt;&gt; IN TODAY&apos;S GIVEN AGE, GIVEN THE CONFLICT OF OUR TIMES I THINK IT&apos;S AMAZING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.936" end="00:02:50.904">WE DON&apos;T NEED TO TORTURE ANIMALS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.904" end="00:02:54.808">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.808" end="00:03:00.714">REAL CHIMPANZEES AS AMAZING AS THEY ARE ARE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND UNPREDICTABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.714" end="00:03:04.685">THEY ARE NOT MEANT TO, LET&apos;S SAY DRESS UP AND PLAY THE DRUMS FOR US.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.685" end="00:03:05.485">&gt;&gt; NOT AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.485" end="00:03:11.792">&gt;&gt; Jon: WERE THERE ANY ACTUAL ANIMALS OR WAS IT ALL PEOPLE IN CAPTURE YOU SUITS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.792" end="00:03:16.330">&gt;&gt; EXCEPT FOR A DOG, JUST PEOPLE IN A SUIT -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:16.330" end="00:03:19.066">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT WOULD BE BAD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.066" end="00:03:22.169">BUT A HECK OF A CAST PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.169" end="00:03:23.303">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.303" end="00:03:29.776">WERE YOU FAMILIAR WITH -- THE PLANET OF APES FILMS CAME UP WHEN I WAS A YOUNGSTER -- DID </p>
<p begin="00:03:29.776" end="00:03:31.345">YOU GO BACK AND LOOK?</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.345" end="00:03:34.081">&gt;&gt; MY MOM WAS A BIG FAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.081" end="00:03:36.083">I HAD SEEN BITS AND PIECES WHEN I WAS LITTLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.083" end="00:03:38.185">I FOUND IT GIMMICKY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.185" end="00:03:41.288">I WAS NOT A BIG FAN BACK THEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.288" end="00:03:42.189">NOW IT&apos;S A DIFFERENT STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.189" end="00:03:46.894">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT IS, IF I MAY, A BIT GIMMICKY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.894" end="00:03:48.295">I WAS A FAN BACK THEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.295" end="00:03:53.901">WHEN YOU WATCH IT NOW YOU REALLY DO GO, WOW, THEY GOT ME ON THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.901" end="00:03:54.568">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.568" end="00:03:58.572">HAVE YOU SEEN THE PART WITH CHARLTON HESTON ON THE BEACH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.572" end="00:03:59.606">&gt;&gt; I HAVEN&apos;T, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.606" end="00:04:01.775">&gt;&gt; Jon: DUDE, YOU HAVE TO -- </p>
<p begin="00:04:01.775" end="00:04:03.810">&gt;&gt; YOU JUST CALLED ME DUDE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.810" end="00:04:06.046">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT WAS AN HONOR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.046" end="00:04:13.353">IT&apos;S THE EXACT SAME WORD I USED WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAT WITH ME AND I CALLED HIM DUDE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.353" end="00:04:14.388">&gt;&gt; I LIKED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.388" end="00:04:21.461">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THAT IS HE DIDN&apos;T CARE FOR IT AS MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.461" end="00:04:26.800">KHALTON HESTON WAS ON THE BEACH AND HE LOOKS UP AND SEES THAT THE PLANET HE HAD BEEN ON WAS </p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:27.801">HIS OWN.</p>
