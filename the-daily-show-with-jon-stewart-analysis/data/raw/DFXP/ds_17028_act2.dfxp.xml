<p begin="00:00:11.612" end="00:00:17.050">I DIDN&apos;T REALLY SQUEEZE HER SO HARD SHE TURNED INTO A GLASS SIAMESE CAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.050" end="00:00:22.890">ANYWAY, IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY YOU NOTICE THAT THE DEFAULT </p>
<p begin="00:00:22.890" end="00:00:27.327">REPUBLICAN NOMINEE MITT ROMNEY SPENDS LITTLE OR NO TIME DOING INTERVIEWS ON THE TV WHERE THE OTHER </p>
<p begin="00:00:27.327" end="00:00:31.932">CANDIDATES ARE WORKING THE SUNDAY NEWS SHOW CIRCUIT LIKE A POLITICIAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.932" end="00:00:34.835">WHY NO ONE ON ONES FOR ROMNEY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.835" end="00:00:41.341">BECAUSE HE&apos;S RUNNING A CLASSIC POLITICAL GAMBIT CALL KD THE MARLIN MONEY STER STRATEGY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.341" end="00:00:46.113">ROMNEY APPEARS ONLY IN DEBATE SURROUNDED BY MONEY STERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.113" end="00:00:48.515">AKA THE OTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.515" end="00:00:53.253">AND INSTANTLY VOTERS THINK THAT PRETTY ONE SEEMS NORMAL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.253" end="00:01:00.460">BUT ON TUESDAY NIGHT ROMNEY DECIDED TO DITCH THE MONEY STERS AND SIT DOWN ONE-ON-ONE WITH FOX NEWS </p>
<p begin="00:01:00.460" end="00:01:08.235">BRETT BAIER WHO FOR NO APPARENT REASON SURROUNDED ROMNEY WITH JELLIES AND MARMALADES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.235" end="00:01:12.706">OR MAYBE THAT&apos;S THE FOX SURVIVAL BUNKER THAT GLENN BECK LEFT BEHIND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.706" end="00:01:15.108">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.108" end="00:01:22.850">&gt;&gt; Jon: CAN&apos;T THINK OF-- BUT IT WAS A GOOD INTERVIEW BY BAIER AND AS BAIER TOLD BILL </p>
<p begin="00:01:22.850" end="00:01:27.087">O&apos;REILLY AFTERWARD, ROMNEY DIDN&apos;T LIKE IT SO MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.087" end="00:01:28.789">&gt;&gt; HE THOUGHT IT WAS OVERLY AGGRESSIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.789" end="00:01:30.424">CLEARLY GOT UP SET WITH THE QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.424" end="00:01:34.194">HE WAS IRRITATED BY THE INTERVIEW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.194" end="00:01:39.266">&gt;&gt; AND AFTER WE FINISHED HE WENT TO HIS HOLDING ROOM AND THEN CAME BACK AND SAID HE </p>
<p begin="00:01:39.266" end="00:01:40.667">DIDN&apos;T LIKE THE INTERVIEW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.667" end="00:01:43.737">AND THOUGHT IT WAS UNCALLED FOR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.737" end="00:01:49.109">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH [BLEEP], JAM FIGHT IN THE MARMALADE ROOM!</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.109" end="00:01:50.477">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:50.477" end="00:01:53.881">&gt;&gt; Jon: JAM FIGHT IN THE MARMALADE ROOM!</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.881" end="00:01:56.650">LET&apos;S GO TO IT LET&apos;S SEE WHAT IS ON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.650" end="00:02:00.687">&gt;&gt; LIGHTNING ROUND HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.687" end="00:02:01.622">WHAT WAS THE LAST BOOK YOU READ.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.622" end="00:02:04.958">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M READING A FUN ONE SO I WILL SKIP THAT, I JUST READ DECISION POINTS BY </p>
<p begin="00:02:04.958" end="00:02:06.527">PRESIDENT BUSH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.527" end="00:02:12.299">&gt;&gt; Jon: GOOD CALL ON READING THE FUN ONE THAT MIGHT HUMANIZE YOU UNDER YOUR HAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.299" end="00:02:13.066">FAVORITE FOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.066" end="00:02:20.140">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M GOING TO KEEP ONES THAT OTHER HUMANS EAT TO MYSELF, AND-- PROTEIN-BASED PASTE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.140" end="00:02:21.608">(LAUGHTER) NAILED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.608" end="00:02:27.347">BY THE WAY, MITT DID YOU SAY THE BOOK YOU JUST FINISHED WAS PRESIDENT BUSH&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:02:27.347" end="00:02:31.451">DECISION POINTS, BECAUSE IF I RECALL ARE YOU WERE ASKED THAT SAME QUESTION GO SIX </p>
<p begin="00:02:31.451" end="00:02:32.853">MONTHS AGO ON THE &quot;TODAY SHOW&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.853" end="00:02:33.820">LET&apos;S SEE WHAT -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:33.820" end="00:02:35.255">&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE LAST BOOK YOU READ.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.255" end="00:02:43.430">&gt;&gt; I JUST FINISHED PRESIDENT BUSH&apos;S BOOK, DECISIONS (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:43.430" end="00:02:44.097">&gt;&gt; Jon: TELL ME SOMETHING,</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.097" end="00:02:48.368">YOU CAN&apos;T JUST FINISH THE SAME BOOK TWICE OVER A SIX MONTH SPAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.368" end="00:02:52.973">THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON JUST FINISHED A BOOK IS LIKE TWO WEEKS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.973" end="00:02:56.443">ACTUALLY THAT WASN&apos;T EVEN A PART OF THE INTERVIEW THAT MADE ROMNEY UP SET.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.443" end="00:02:57.611">THIS WAS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.611" end="00:03:01.582">&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES OF SOME ISSUES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.582" end="00:03:03.217">&gt;&gt; CLIMATE CHANGE, ABORTION,</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.217" end="00:03:04.651">IMMIGRATION, GAY RIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.651" end="00:03:07.688">&gt;&gt; WELL, BRETT, YOUR LIST IS JUST NOT ACCURATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.688" end="00:03:12.059">SO ONE WE&apos;RE GOING HAVE TO BE BETTER INFORMED ON MY VIEWS ON ISSUES AND OUR PLAN -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:12.059" end="00:03:15.662">&gt;&gt; DID YOU SAY ON CAMERA ANDO AND OTHER PLACES THAT AT TIMES YOU THOUGHT IT </p>
<p begin="00:03:15.662" end="00:03:17.598">WOULD BE A MODEL FOR THE NATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.598" end="00:03:18.699">&gt;&gt; YOU ARE WRONG, BRETT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.699" end="00:03:20.334">&gt;&gt; NO, NO, THERE IS TAPE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.334" end="00:03:21.668">&gt;&gt; NO, THE TAPE OUT THERE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.668" end="00:03:26.807">CONTINUE TO READ THE TAPE AND THE TAPE GOES ON TO SAY FOR EACH STATE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT,.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.807" end="00:03:28.675">&gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL YOU DON&apos;T READ TAPES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.675" end="00:03:32.913">SECOND OF ALL--  (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:03:32.913" end="00:03:35.616">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M SURE IF YOU READ IT LONG ENOUGH IT IS AS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING TO YOU </p>
<p begin="00:03:35.616" end="00:03:39.086">BECAUSE IT TAKES YOU INTO PRESENT-DAY WHERE YOU HAVE COMPLETELY CHANGED YOUR POSITION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.086" end="00:03:40.787">SO BUT HERE&apos;S THE THING,</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.787" end="00:03:45.225">LOOK HOW ANGRY AND DEFENSIVE MITT ROMNEY GETS ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT PREVIOUS </p>
<p begin="00:03:45.225" end="00:03:49.329">POLITICAL POSITIONS HE TOOK WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR OF A MORE LIBERAL STATE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.329" end="00:03:49.763">MASSACHUSETTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.763" end="00:03:53.400">AND THE POLITICAL POSITIONS HE TOOK WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN THE MORE </p>
<p begin="00:03:53.400" end="00:03:56.537">MODERATE 2008 REPUBLICAN PRIMARY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.537" end="00:04:00.307">WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT EVASIVE, DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE RECENTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.307" end="00:04:05.646">&gt;&gt; SHE HAD THE 61 TEXT OR CALL, SOME OF THEM -- OR 5 IN THE MORNING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.646" end="00:04:08.782">&gt;&gt; ALL THIS IS AS IS 61 CALLS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.782" end="00:04:10.817">I TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE 61 TIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.817" end="00:04:12.920">WE DON&apos;T EVEN KNOW OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.920" end="00:04:17.291">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:04:17.291" end="00:04:25.532">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT WAIT, THAT&apos;S HERMAN CAIN TRYING TO EVADE QUESTIONS ABOUT A POTENTIAL MISTRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.532" end="00:04:32.739">I MEAN WHY WOULD MITT ROMNEY BEHAVE THE SAME WAY ABOUT HIS POLIT-- I THINK I </p>
<p begin="00:04:32.739" end="00:04:35.175">FIGURED OUT WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.175" end="00:04:40.981">JUST LIKE HERMAN CAIN, MITT ROMNEY HAS AN EMBARRASSING PERSON IN HIS PAST WHO HE IS </p>
<p begin="00:04:40.981" end="00:04:44.084">DESPERATELY TRYING TO HIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.084" end="00:04:46.420">FOR HERMAN KANE A WOMAN NAMED GINGER WHITE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.420" end="00:04:49.489">FOR MITT ROMNEY, IT&apos;S MITT ROMNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.489" end="00:05:00.033">(LAUGHTER) MITT ROMNEY, MITT ROMNEY IS HIS OWN MISTRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.033" end="00:05:01.368">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:01.368" end="00:05:06.740">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND BY THE WAY, IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THEY SAY OPPOSITES ATTRACT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.740" end="00:05:11.879">ROMNEY KNOWS IF VOTERS FIND OUT ABOUT THIS OTHER FAR MORE LIBERAL GUY HE&apos;S BEEN </p>
<p begin="00:05:11.879" end="00:05:15.249">WITH, THEY&apos;LL NEVER TRUST HIM AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.249" end="00:05:17.050">OH, THE EMBARRASSMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.050" end="00:05:21.054">HERE HE WAS TO TRUMP THE PUBLIC FIGURE HOLDING POLITICAL OFFICE OFFICE ALL </p>
<p begin="00:05:21.054" end="00:05:25.592">WHILE SECRETLY LAVISHING HIS LOVER WITH HEALTH CARE AND AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.592" end="00:05:30.831">AND I&apos;M SURE HE&apos;S JUST GOING TO CLAIM THAT HE WAS FRIENDS WITH HIS YOUNGER SPOUSE BUT </p>
<p begin="00:05:30.831" end="00:05:34.268">COME ON-- ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME NEVER TAPPED THAT?</p>
