<p begin="00:01:34.661" end="00:01:39.700">&gt;&gt; LET ME GIVE YOU A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF WHAT FAIR AND BALANCED MEANS TO ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.700" end="00:01:45.172">AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA PILED ON FEMA FOR ITS FAILURE TO RESPOND TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:45.172" end="00:01:45.906">THE CRISIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.906" end="00:01:49.142">AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID A LOUSY JOB.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.142" end="00:01:54.648">BUT IT WAS FOX NEWS THAT STARTED REPORTING ON THE FAILURE OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS, THE CITY OF NEW </p>

<p begin="00:02:03.156" end="00:02:05.792">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S YOUR EXAMPLE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.792" end="00:02:12.132">YOU HAD A WEEK TO PREPARE AN EXAMPLE AND YOU CAME UP WITH IN 2005 EVERYONE WAS (BEEP) ON </p>
<p begin="00:02:12.132" end="00:02:18.438">THE REPUBLICANS AND WE MADE SURE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT LOCAL LOUISIANA DEMOCRATS (BEEP) TOO.</p>

<p begin="00:02:54.408" end="00:02:59.112">THEY WERE REPORTING ON THE CRAZY ATF OPERATION THAT ALLOWED MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS </p>
<p begin="00:02:59.112" end="00:03:03.050">TO PURCHASE AUTOMATIC WEAPONS INTO AMERICA AND SELL THEM BACK TO MEXICO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.050" end="00:03:05.953">&gt;&gt; SOME SAY IT WAS INNOCENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.953" end="00:03:10.157">OTHERS BELIEVE IT WAS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN TO JUSTIFY TOUGHER GUN LAWS IN THE U.S.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.157" end="00:03:11.625">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID YOU SEE THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.625" end="00:03:13.360">HE JUST THREW IT RIGHT IN THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:17.297">PRESIDENT OBAMA IS EITHER INCOMPETENT MAKING AN INNOCENT MISTAKE OR THE ARCHITECT OF AN </p>
<p begin="00:03:17.297" end="00:03:23.303">EVIL CONSPIRACY TO WREAK VIOLENT CARNAGE IN MEXICO AS A WAY TO TAKE AWAY AMERICA&apos;S GUNS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.303" end="00:03:27.674">YOU KNOW, BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.674" end="00:03:31.812">WHO SAID THAT NERK AMERICA WAS INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF CONSPIRACY THAT, IF TRUE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.812" end="00:03:34.281">COULD OPENLY LEAD TO THE IMPEACHMENT OF A PRESIDENT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.281" end="00:03:36.116">WHO SAID IT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.116" end="00:03:38.452">&gt;&gt; OTHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.452" end="00:03:41.955">&gt;&gt; Jon: OF COURSE CHRIS WALLACE&apos;S MAIN CLAIM TO CREDIBILITY WAS THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.955" end="00:03:46.560">&gt;&gt; AS WE SHOWED TODAY WE DON&apos;T GO EASY ON REPUBLICANS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:52.499">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT AT LEAST FOR ONE HOUR OF FOX&apos;S 168 HOURS OF PROGRAMMING A WEEK, REALLY,</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.499" end="00:03:54.801">IT&apos;S THREE HOURS BECAUSE IT&apos;S REPEATED TWICE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.801" end="00:03:57.671">MOTHER SAID IT&apos;S CRAZY TO WATCH IT LIKE THAT BUT I DON&apos;T THINK IT&apos;S CRAZY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.671" end="00:04:04.244">I THINK WATCHING IT AT 2:00 AND 6:00 WHEN IT&apos;S REPEATED IS ACTUALLY THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.244" end="00:04:05.679">I WONDER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.679" end="00:04:06.613">I WONDER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.613" end="00:04:12.286">I WONDER IF THE FACT THAT I MAKE FUN OF DEMOCRATS WOULD THEN BE PROOF THAT I&apos;M NOT BIASED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.286" end="00:04:15.689">&gt;&gt; AM I AN ACTIVIST IN YOUR MIND.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.689" end="00:04:16.056">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.056" end="00:04:17.658">&gt;&gt; THEN I DISAGREE WITH YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.658" end="00:04:20.794">I ABSOLUTELY DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT&apos;S THE CASE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.794" end="00:04:21.395">I DON&apos;T THINK....</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.395" end="00:04:24.598">&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU TAKE SHOTS AT...</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.598" end="00:04:27.968">ALTHOUGH I THINK IT&apos;S TO MAINTAIN CREDIBILITY AND YOU&apos;RE NOT AS COMFORTABLE WITH IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.968" end="00:04:31.238">YOU TAKE SHOTS AT OBAMA AND AT THE LIBERALS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.238" end="00:04:33.307">YOU LIKE TO MAKE FUN OF CONSERVATIVES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.307" end="00:04:34.107">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU SEE THE GAME?</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.107" end="00:04:39.213">I MAKE FUN OF CONSERVATIVES OR REPUBLICANS BECAUSE I&apos;M A LIBERAL PARTISAN IDEOLOGUE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.213" end="00:04:44.184">I MAKE FUN OF LIBERALS OR DEMOCRATS BECAUSE I WANT AS PART OF MY BRILLIANT YET </p>

<p begin="00:04:48.255" end="00:04:50.224">AND REPUBLICANS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.224" end="00:04:55.662">AND THAT NARRATIVE OF CONSERVATIVE VICTIMIZATION IS THE TRUE GENIUS OF WHAT FOX </p>
<p begin="00:04:55.662" end="00:04:57.264">NEWS HAS ACCOMPLISHED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.264" end="00:05:02.803">ANY EDITORIAL JUDGMENT IN NEWS OR SCHOOLS OR MOVIES THAT DOESN&apos;T FAVOR THE CONSERVATIVE </p>
<p begin="00:05:02.803" end="00:05:07.841">VIEW IS ELITISM AND IS EVIDENCE OF LIBERAL BIAS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.841" end="00:05:14.147">WHEREAS ANY EDITORIAL JUDGMENT THAT FAVORS THE CONSERVATIVE VIEW IS EVIDENCE OF MERELY OF </p>
<p begin="00:05:14.147" end="00:05:18.218">FAIRNESS AND DONE TO PROTECT THEM FROM LIBERAL BIAS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.218" end="00:05:23.557">AND IF YOU CRITICIZE FOX FOR THIS GAME, GUESS WHAT THAT IS EVIDENCE OF?</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.557" end="00:05:26.260">HOW RIGHT THEY ARE ABOUT HOW PERSECUTED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.260" end="00:05:30.531">IT IS AIRTIGHTER THAN AN OTTER&apos;S ANUS.</p>
