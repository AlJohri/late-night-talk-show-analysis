<p begin="00:00:26.660" end="00:00:32.566">OH, WE ARE BACK FROM ANOTHER UNDESERVED VACATION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.566" end="00:00:34.368">MY GUEST TONIGHT SHAQUILLE O&apos;NEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.368" end="00:00:41.542">I ASSUME FULLY RECOVERED FROM ST. PATRICK&apos;S DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.542" end="00:00:45.779">WHILE WE WERE GONE, WHILE WE WERE ON VACATION THIS PAST WEEK, A LOT WENT ON.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.779" end="00:00:49.650">THERE WAS THE USUAL REPUBLICAN PRIMARY SHENANIGANS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.650" end="00:00:53.687">WE TRIED BUT FAILED TO AVOID TALKING ABOUT THAT UNTIL TOMORROW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.687" end="00:00:57.558">FOR THE FIRST DAY BACK THERE WERE REALLY ONLY TWO STORIES THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.558" end="00:01:06.600">&gt;&gt; FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY HAD HEART TRANSPLANT SURGERY EARLIER TODAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.600" end="00:01:10.904">&gt;&gt; Jon: GREATEST JOKE SET-UP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.904" end="00:01:13.273">EVER!</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.273" end="00:01:15.843">I CAN MAKE THE SHOW OUT OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.843" end="00:01:16.977">WHAT&apos;S THE OTHER STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.977" end="00:01:22.316">&gt;&gt; THE CONTROVERSIAL SHOOTING DEATH OF 17-YEAR-OLD TRAYVON MARTIN ONE MONTH AGO IN </p>
<p begin="00:01:22.316" end="00:01:30.858">SANFORD FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.858" end="00:01:34.161">&gt;&gt; Jon: (MUMBLING).</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.161" end="00:01:35.529">THAT&apos;S THE HEADLINES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.529" end="00:01:38.932">OH, THE HEADLINE IS DICK CHENEY GOT A NEW HEART.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.932" end="00:01:42.836">I&apos;M SURE BY THE WAY THAT THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT HEADLINE IN THE ORGAN COMMUNITY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.836" end="00:01:47.241">PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE INNOCENT HEART SENTENCED TO LIFE IN CHENEY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.241" end="00:01:48.242">BOOM!</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.242" end="00:01:49.943">BOOM!</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.943" end="00:01:53.146">I&apos;M GOING TO GET TO DO A FON OF THESE TODAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.146" end="00:01:57.718">&gt;&gt; MARTIN HAD GONE OUT TO BUY CANDY WEARING A HOODED SWEAT SHIRT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.718" end="00:02:00.754">&gt;&gt; CARRYING SKITTLES AND AN ICED AT A.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.754" end="00:02:05.459">&gt;&gt; 28-YEAR-OLD GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WAS ACTING AS A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.459" end="00:02:12.466">&gt;&gt; HE FOLLOWED AND CHASED HIM DESPITE THE POLICE DISPATCHER TELLING HIM NOT TO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.466" end="00:02:15.836">&gt;&gt; Jon: HEART TRANSPLANT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.836" end="00:02:22.276">ISN&apos;T IT MORE OF A HEART PLANT WHEN YOU DON&apos;T HAVE AN ORIGINAL?</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.276" end="00:02:39.459">HEY, I THINK WE HAVE A CLIP OF CHENEY SELECTING THE NEW ORGAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.459" end="00:02:40.761">HE&apos;S NOT A NICE MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.761" end="00:02:44.898">&gt;&gt; THE POLICE APPEARED TO HAVE DONE A VERY CURSORY INVESTIGATION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.898" end="00:02:49.236">&gt;&gt; ZIMMERMAN HAS NOT BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY CRIME AND CONTINUES TO CARRY THE WEAPON </p>
<p begin="00:02:49.236" end="00:02:50.871">THAT KILLED TRAYVON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.871" end="00:02:53.173">&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE YOU (BEEP)?</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.173" end="00:02:58.245">HEY, EVERYBODY, HERE&apos;S MY IMPRESSION OF DICK CHENEY&apos;S SURGEON REMOVING CHENEY&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:02:58.245" end="00:03:00.113">ORIGINAL HEART.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.113" end="00:03:03.250">IT BIT ME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.250" end="00:03:05.052">(SCREAMING) OH, MY GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.052" end="00:03:08.856">WHY DOES A HUMAN HEART HAVE FANGS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.856" end="00:03:11.058">(SCREAMING) ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.058" end="00:03:14.428">I CAN&apos;T DO THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.428" end="00:03:17.130">HOW IS THIS GUY ZIMMERMAN NOT CHARGEDED WITH ANYTHING?</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:21.368">HOW CAN THE GUY STILL HAVE A GUN THAT HE SHOT THIS KID WITH?</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.368" end="00:03:23.470">&gt;&gt; ZIMMERMAN IS NOT UNDER ARREST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.470" end="00:03:28.208">PERHAPS IN PART BECAUSE OF FLORIDA&apos;S &quot;STAND YOUR GROUND&quot; LAW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.208" end="00:03:29.910">&gt;&gt; Jon: FLORIDA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.910" end="00:03:36.783">I FEEL LIKE FLORIDA AND ARIZONA ARE LOCKED IN A HARM&apos;S RACE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.783" end="00:03:40.654">ALL RIGHT, FLORIDA, WHAT IS THE &quot;STAND YOUR GROUND LAW.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:40.654" end="00:03:45.292">&gt;&gt; THE LAW SAYS A CITIZEN WHO FEELS THREATENED HAS NO DUTY TO RETREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.292" end="00:03:50.631">IN FLORIDA IS IMMUNE FROM CIVIL OR CRIMINAL ACTION IF THE FORCE IS CONSIDERED JUSTIFIED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.631" end="00:03:57.738">&gt;&gt; FLORIDA&apos;S &quot;STAND YOUR GROUND&quot; LAW GIVES ENORMOUS LEE </p>
<p begin="00:03:57.738" end="00:04:03.210">WAY FOR PEOPLE LIKE ZIMMERMAN TO USE DEADLY FORCE IF THEY FEEL THREATENED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.210" end="00:04:06.046">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW CAN A STATE HAVE THAT LAW AND SPRING BREAK?</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.046" end="00:04:07.447">HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.447" end="00:04:13.253">LET&apos;S PASS A LAW SAYING ANYONE WHO FEELS THREATENED DOESN&apos;T HAVE TO RETREAT AND THEN </p>
<p begin="00:04:13.253" end="00:04:16.690">INVITE DOZENS OF FRAT GUYS TO TOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.690" end="00:04:20.460">IT&apos;S LIKE IN NEW YORK SUBWAY: IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SHOOT SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.460" end="00:04:24.831">IT&apos;S A GREAT IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.831" end="00:04:30.270">I SEEM TO RECALL A SLIGHT COMPLICATION FOR THIS ZIMMERMAN &quot;STAND YOUR GROUND&quot; DEFENSE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.270" end="00:04:31.705">&gt;&gt; ARE YOU FOLLOWING HIM?</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.705" end="00:04:32.639">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:34.741">&gt;&gt; WE DON&apos;T NEED YOU TO DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.741" end="00:04:35.909">&gt;&gt; OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.909" end="00:04:38.879">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, OKAY.</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.282" end="00:04:46.153">DOES FLORIDA ALSO HAVE A &quot;MOVE YOUR GROUND&quot; LAW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.153" end="00:04:50.090">IF THE POLICE HAD DONE A MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME PERHAPS THE </p>

<p begin="00:05:24.157" end="00:05:24.558">&gt;&gt; CORRECT.</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.225" end="00:06:01.628">&gt;&gt; CAN WE PLAY JUST THAT SECOND WORD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.628" end="00:06:06.033">JUST WHAT WE THINK THE SECOND WORD IS.</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.738" end="00:06:14.842">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT DOESN&apos;T SOUND LIKE A WORD AT ALL.</p>
