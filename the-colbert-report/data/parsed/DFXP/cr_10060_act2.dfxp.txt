Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, I TRY TO LIVE BY THE WORDS OF THE GOSPEL, AND THE BIBLE CLEARLY SAYS LET HE WHO IS WITHOUT SIN CAST THE FIRST  STONE.  HAVE AT YOU! THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, LONGTIME VIEWERS KNOW I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF THE T.S.A. AMERICA'S FRONT LINE IN CREATING LINES. I RECENTLY LEARNED SOMETHING THAT HAS GIVEN ME MORE THAN THREE OUNCES OF RAGE.
A FORMER T.S.A. SECURITY SCREENER CLAIMS HIS FELLOW AGENTS AMUSED THEMSELVES BY MOCKING THE IMAGES OF PASSENGERS PRODUCED BY THE AIRPORT'S BODY SCANNERS.
JOKES ABOUT PASSENGERS RAN RAMPANT. MANY IMAGES WE GAWKED AT WERE OVER-WEIGHT PEOPLE, THEIR EVERY FOLD AND DIMPLE ON FULL AWFUL DISPLAY.
OFFICERS GAWKING AT IMAGES OF OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE AND GENITALS.
Stephen:  GAWKING AT OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE'S GENITALS. I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT OF BEING OVERWEIGHT WAS TO CONCEAL YOUR GENITALS. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TO T.S.A. PEEPING TOMS. NOW EVERYBODY WILL BE SELF-CONSCIENCE ABOUT TRAVELING. YOU'LL HAVE TO GET IN SHAPE FOR EVERY FLIGHT LIKE IT'S YOUR WEDDING DAY. YOU'LL BE ON A 6-MONTH CAYENNE CLEANSE AND SPINNING TWICE A DAY JUST TO LOOK GOOD FOR YOUR TRIP TO THE DEMOINE AUTO PARTS CONFERENCE. BUT YOU GOTTA DO IT. IT'S YOUR  SPECIAL DAY. AND THE T.S.A. IS ALSO TAKING OUR BEST COPING MECHANISM-- BOOZE. THE AUTHOR OF THE EXPOSE  TWEETED,"ONE THING I LEFT OUT OF THAT POLITICO PIECE, HELL, YES, AIRPORT EMPLOYEES OFTEN DRINK THOSE BOTTLES OF ALCOHOL YOU SURRENDER AT THE CHECKPOINT. THIS IS A FLAGRANT ABUSE OF POWER. THEY'RE BACK THERE LIVING IT UP ON ALL OUR CONFISCATED GOODS. SUCKING DOWN OUR WHISKEY, LATHERING UP WITH OUR 8 oz. SHAMPOO, RINSING WITH OUR DASANI BOTTLES, ALL THE WHILE CLIPPING THEIR TOENAILS UNTIL THE COWS COME HOME. IT SICKENS ME TO THINK SOMEONE IS CHUGGING MY TRAVEL MAYO  AND FIRING MY TASER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NEXT UP. I LOVE ART. BUT I'M WAY TOO FAMOUS TO GO TO A MUSEUM. SO I WAS EXCITED TO LEARN THAT TODAY'S BEST ART IS DELIVERED HOT IN 30 MINUTES OR LESS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST THINK I'M A PUNK KID MAKING PIZZAS. BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THE TRUTH IS, THERE IS MORE TO DOMINO PIZZA MAKERS THAN YOU THINK.
MANY OF US HAVE A REAL PASSION FOR CRAFTING THINGS BY HAND, LIKE OUR HANDMADE PAN PIZZA. MADE WITH FRESH DOUGH AND 2 LAYERS OF CHEESE.
Stephen:  YES, DOMINO'S IS LIKE PARIS IN THE 20s. IF PARIS WERE SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN A UPS STORE AND A DRESS BARN. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO THE PIZZA ARTIST FROM DOMINO'S SCHOOL, BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME WHEN I ORDER A BOX OF WINGS IS THE LIFE STORY OF THE GUY WHO DUMPED THEM IN THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I FINALLY GET DOMINO'S. IT'S NOT PIZZA. IT'S ART. NOW, AT FIRST BLUSH, IT APPEARS EPHEMERAL, A PROTEAN MASS OF MEATS AND CHEESES, BUT AFTER A NIGHT ON THE COUNTER IT'S AS DENSE AND IMPENETRABLE AS RODIN'S GATES OF HELL. [LAUGHTER] ALTHOUGH, I GOTTA SAY, STILL PRETTY GOOD WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK. FINALLY FOLKS, THERE IS NO STRONGER DEFENDER OF FREE SPEECH THAN ME TRULY. AND IF YOU DISAGREE I'LL CUT YOUR VOCAL CORDS. THAT'S WHY I WAS SO PUMPED BY A RECENT FEDERAL  COURT RULING.
A FEDERAL COURT HAS RULED YOU CAN FLASH YOUR HEADLIGHTS TO WARN DRIVERS OF A SPEED TRAP AHEAD. AN ACLU MEMBER TOLD THE JOURNAL, TODAY'S RULING IS A CIVIL RIGHTS VICTORY FOR DRIVERS.
FLASHING YOUR LIGHTS IS FREEDOM OF SPEECH. THIS IS A GREAT VICTORY FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
Stephen:  YES, FLASHING YOUR LIGHTS AT SPEED TRAPS IS A BASIC RIGHT. IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO PAUL REVERE'S FAMOUS CRY, ONE IF BY LAND, TWO IF BY SEA, THREE IF I CAN'T DRIVE 55. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF BY SEA, THREE IF I CAN'T DRIVE 55. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHY I GIVE A TIP OF THE HAT TO FEDERAL JUDGES, AND, FOLKS, I CANNOT WAIT TO RELAY THIS GOOD NEWS TO THE MILLIONS OF MY VIEWERS WHO ARE WATCHING RIGHT NOW WHILE ALSO DRIVING A TRUCK, OKAY. FIRST, I GOTTA GET OUT-- GOTTA GET OUT MY TRUCKER HAT, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. GOTTA GET OUT MY OLD CB RADIO. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG TRIP, SO I HAVE GOT MY SPORTS DRINK. AND MY TOILET. OKAY.  ALL RIGHT HERE WE GO. BREAKING 1-9, BREAKER 1-9, YOU GOT YOUR EARS ON. THIS IS BIG DADDY TRUCKNUTS WITH THE 10-17 FOR MY BROTHER TRUCKERS. A MAN IN BLACK HAS LAID IT DOWN. SOME NO GOOD BUDDIES WILL HIT THE CAGE FOR BLINKING HER EYES THERE'S A FLAG FLY ON THE 20s FOR DUDLEY DO-RIGHT. SKIP THE DOUBLE NICKELS ON THE GREEN STAMPS AND DROP THE HAMMER DOWN BECAUSE IF THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS TAKING PICTURES A GOOD NEIGHBOR WILL HIT YOU WITH A STROBE LIGHT ON THE FLIP SIDE TO GIVE YOU THE HEADS UP ON THE BEAR BITES. PEDAL TO THE MEDAL, BIG BUDDY IS OUT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT? ALL THAT AUTHENTIC TRUCKER LINGO MADE ME THIRSTY. MMM-MMM. OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD! OH! MMM-MMM. NOPE. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S THE URINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
