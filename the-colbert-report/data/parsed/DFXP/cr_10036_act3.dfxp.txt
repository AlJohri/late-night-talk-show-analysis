(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT JUST WON THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR HIS NEW BOOK "THE UNWINDING." I WONDER IF I HAVE TO READ "THE WINDING" FIRST. PLEASE WELCOME GEORGE PACKER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, GEORGE, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING BACK. IT'S BEEN ONE OR SIX YEARS SINCE YOU WERE LAST HERE. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, TOO.
Stephen: YOU'RE A "NEW YORKER" STAFF WRITER. YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF "THE ASSASSIN'S GATE" WHICH WAS ABOUT AMERICA IN IRAQ. NOW YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK. "THE UNWINDING: AN INNER HISTORY OF THE NEW AMERICA." OKAY, I'LL BITE. HOW ARE WE UNWINDING? WHAT IS UNWINDING AMERICA OTHER THAN, LET'S SAY, GAY MARRIAGE, LEGALIZED POT, AND SOCIALIZED MEDICINE? (LAUGHTER) SHOULD I HAVE SAID SPOILER ALERT? DID I JUST GIVE AWAY THE BOOK?
THOSE ARE NOT THE BIG THEMES OF THE BOOK. THE BOOK IS ABOUT HOW OVER THE ON THE INSTITUTIONS INSTITUTIONS THAT USED TO SUPPORT THE BROAD MAJORITY OF AMERICANS LIKE GOVERNMENT, LIKE NEWS MEDIA, LIKE CORPORATIONS, LIKE SCHOOLS HAVE STOPPED WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE MAJORITY.
Stephen: CORPORATIONS ARE DOING FINE, MY FRIEND.
THEY ARE DOING WELL. BUT MOST OF AMERICA IS NOT. SO WE'VE BECOME MORE AND MORE A COUNTRY DIVIDED BETWEEN WINNERS AND LOSERS. LET ME JUST SAY, THIS IS NOT AN ARGUMENT BOOK. IT'S NOT A POLICY BOOK. THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD BOOKS ABOUT THIS SUBJECT.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE NOT ARGUING WITH THE BOOK?
I AM NOT. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: SO IF WE WERE TO HAVE AN ARGUMENT, I'VE ALREADY WON?
DOESN'T THAT ALWAYS HAPPEN? (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: CERTAINLY ONCE WE'RE DONE EDITING. (LAUGHTER) SO IT'S DESCRIBING THE STATE OF AMERICA.
WELL, INSTEAD OF MAKING AN ARGUMENT THAT YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH BUT QUICKLY FORGET IT GOES THROUGH THE LIVES OF HALF A DOZEN AMERICANS AND FOLLOWS THEM OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 30 OR 35 YEARS, THE HUGE CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY AND THE WAY THEY'VE REACTED.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE BIGGEST CHANGE? MY UNDERSTANDING HOW THE ECONOMY WORKS-- YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG-- IS THAT YOU WORK HARD, YOU PLAY FAIR AND YOU'RE REWARDED. THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM. YOU KNOW? AND -- PLAY BY THE RULES, YOU GET A HOUSE TO LIVE IN. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: AND THE BIGGEST CHANGE IS THAT NO LONGER WORKS AND THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THIS BOOK WHO WORK HARD, BASICALLY PLAY BY THE RULES-- THEY MAKE MISTAKES, THEY'RE HUMAN-- BUT THEY END UP WITH VERY LITTLE OR NOTHING. AND THEY'RE STRUGGLING OR EVEN DROWNING AND THERE'S NO STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT THEIR ASPIRATIONS. THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN. STPWHAOUP ARE THESE STRUCTURES THAT WE USED TO HAVE?
A DECENT PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.
Stephen: WELL, PUBLIC SCHOOLS RELY ON MY TAXES. (LAUGHTER) I'M THE GUY PAYING FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, MANY I KIDS GO PRIVATE, I CAN'T BE PAYING FOR THAT. THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. WHAT ELSE? (LAUGHTER) AGAIN, WE'RE NOT HAVING AN ARGUMENT. WE'RE NOT HAVING AN ARGUMENT.
YOU MENTIONED CORPORATIONS. IT USED TO BE THE CORPORATIONS HAD OTHER INTERESTS BESIDES SHARE PRICE BUT WHEN THEY BECAME THE ONLY GOAL OF C.E.O.s, SHARE PRICE AND THEIR OWN SALARIES AND BONUSES THEY STOPPED THINKING ABOUT THEIR WORKERS AS HAVING A KEY ROLE AND HAVING CERTAIN RIGHTS AND IT BEING NECESSARY. I MEAN, IN SOME WAYS CORPORATIONS --
Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GOING POPE FRANCIS ON ME RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. I BET HE'S ACTUALLY A VERY POWERFUL VOICE FOR THIS. OBAMA QUOTED HIM IN A SPEECH HE GAVE ON INEQUALITY ABOUT A WEEK AGO. IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOME LEADER TALKING ABOUT THIS. WE CAN'T FIND TOO MANY IN WASHINGTON SO WE HAVE TO LOOK TO THE VATICAN.
Stephen: OBAMA CALLED THE POPE SOULFUL. (LAUGHTER) WHICH I FOUND OFFENSIVE. I DON'T WANT MY POPE DESCRIBED LIKE BARRY WHITE. (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU SAYING THAT I'M -- GUYS LIKE ME WHO BELIEVE IN OUR CORPORATE HEGEMONY NOW WHO BELIEVE IN SMALLER GOVERNMENT AND LESS SOCIAL SERVICES THAT WE'RE THE PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE LIKE THAT?
STEPHEN, THAT IS VERY NICE SET BUT YOU DID NOT BUILD IT. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: GO ON, ELIZABETH WARREN.
SHE'S IN THE BOOK.
Stephen: OH, I BET SHE IS. OH, I BET SHE IS. I BET THERE'S A FOLDOUT OF HER. (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE TEN WELL-KNOWN AMERICANS PROFILED IN THE BOOK AS WELL AS THESE FIVE OR SIX PENAL YOU DON'T KNOW AND I -- I ADMIRE HER BECAUSE SHE HAS THE GUTS TO TELL BANKERS WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR AND THERE'S VERY FEW PEOPLE IN PUBLIC LIFE WHO DO. LOOK, WE HAVE --
Stephen: SO WHAT DOBACKERS NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT THEY SHOULD HEAR? I'M HAVING A CHRISTMAS PARTY TONIGHT, I'LL TELL THEM.
THAT WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO WORK AT WAL-MART CAN'T -- CAN BARELY AFFORD TO SHOP AT WAL-MART WHICH IS WHY BLACK FRIDAY WAS A BUST THIS YEAR.
Stephen: THEY DON'T NEED TO BECAUSE WAL-MART ENCOURAGES WORKERS TO GIVE EACH OTHER OLD CANNED FOOD.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: AND AS LONG AS THEY'RE TRADING EACH OTHER DEL MONTE PEAS WE'RE GOOD. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THAT I'M NOT MAKING.
Stephen: I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T BECAUSE I COULD KNOCK THAT DOWN IN A MINUTE. I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT.
THERE ARE SIX SURVIVING WAL-MART HEIRS THAT HAVE MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM 42% OF AMERICANS. NOW, THAT'S SUCH A GAP OF INEQUALITY THAT THE ECONOMY NO LONGER WORKS AND PEOPLE ARE CYNICAL AND THINK THE GAME IS RIGGED. WE DON'T EXPECT EQUAL RESULTS, BUT WHEN THE GAP IS SO WIDE, EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ITSELF SEEMS LIKE A SHAM.
Stephen: THERE IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. WHETHER IT'S LIKE ONE OF THE HEIRS OF WAL-MART OR, YOU KNOW, SOME GUY WORKING A MINIMUM WAGE JOB, THEY HAVE THE EXACT SAME CHANCE TO WIN THE PICK 4 OF THE POWERBALL. (LAUGHTER) OR THE SCRATCHOFF. THERE'S SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY'VE SHARED AN EQUAL CHANCE OF. YOU WILL ADMIT THAT.
AND IT IS MORE AND MORE OF A LOTTERY. BECAUSE KNOW WHO LONGER HAVE THE UPWARD MOBILITY THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN OUR CLAIM TO BEING IN EGALITARIAN SOCIETY. EUROPE IS A MORE SOCIALLY MOBILE PLACE THAN THE UNITED STATES NOW.
Stephen: YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) SIR, HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THE ETERNAL TRUTH THAT AMERICA'S GREATEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF IT?
WE LIKE TO THINK THAT.
Stephen: OH, IT'S -- IT'S TRUE! THAT'S WHY WE LIKE IT. AND AMERICA'S GREATEST DAYS ARE ALSO BEHIND IT. IT'S RIGHT NOW!
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
Stephen: AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN! (LAUGHTER) GEORGE PACKER, THANK YOU SO MUCH. GEORGE PACKER, THE UNWINDING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
