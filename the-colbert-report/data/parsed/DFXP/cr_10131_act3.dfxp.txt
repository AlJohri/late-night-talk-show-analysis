(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI. NOW BEFORE THE BREAK, BY THE WAY, IS IT SPEAKER PELOSI, LEADER PELOSI, WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU.
NANCY.
OKAY. I WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL WHILE I ATTACK YOU FOR ATTACKING THE MIDDLE CLASS, OKAY.
NO, NO, I AM PROMOTING THE MIDDLE CLASS.
OKAY, I FORGOT WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE THING YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.
MIDDLE CLASS JUMP-START.
WHEN WILL YOU START JUMPING ON THE MIDDLE CLASS
WE'RE JUMPING FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS.
ARE YOU GOING TO RAISE TAXES. GUYS LIKE ME MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR, ARE YOU GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ME.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. WHAT WE HAVE IS TO STOP GIVING TAX BREAKS TO CORPORATIONS THAT ARE SHIPPING JOBS OVERSEAS, INSTEAD OF GIVING TAX BREAKS TO KEEP GOOD PAYING JOBS HERE.
Stephen: YOU KNOW I'M A CORPORATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT'S ATTACKING ME. I'M A CORPORATION AND THIS ENTIRE SHOW IS WRITTEN IN MALAYSIA --
AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD ROAD, BRIDGES, BROADBAND, WATER SYSTEMS BY CLOSING TAX LOOPHOLES FOR SPECIAL INTERESTS IN THE TAX CODE.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES REAL QUICKLY. IMMIGRATION, WHY DO YOU THINK OBAMA IS ENCOURAGING ALL THESE CHILDREN TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES? (LAUGHTER) WHAT IS HIS PLAN? WHAT IS HIS GRIFT HERE? YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO REGISTER THESE 8-YEAR-OLDS FROM GUATEMALA TO VOTE, RIGHT?
I KNOW YOU'RE A VERY DEVOUT CATHOLIC. AND I WISH YOU WOULD READ THE CATHOLIC CONFERENCE BISHOP'S REPORT. THEY TALK ABOUT THE BABY JESUS BEING A REFUGE FROM VIOLENCE AS AN EXAMPLE. AND THEY TELL IT-- .
Stephen: HE DIDN'T ASK TO BE A CITIZEN IN EGYPT. HE DIDN'T ASK TO BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR THE PHAROAH HE WENT BACK TO THE HOLY LAND EVENTUALLY.
THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR THE PHAROAH IN THOSE DAYS.
Stephen: OKAY.
BUT THE FACT IS-- .
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
THAT WAS NOT A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. NO-- THIS IS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. AND IT NEEDS A HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE, AND IT ALSO NEEDS A RESPONSE THAT SAYS IF YOU HAVE A LEGITIMATE CLAIM FOR REFUGEE STATUS OR ASYLUM, THAT'S ONE THING. IF NOT YOU'RE GOING BACK HOME. BUT LET'S DO THAT EXPEDITIOUSLY AND LET'S DO IT WITH RESPECT FOR THE DIGNITY OF EACH OF THESE PEOPLE. SO-- .
Stephen: YOU LAUNCHED MIDDLE CLASS JUMP-START,.
MIDDLE CLASS JUMP-START.
Stephen: LAST WEEK WHEN WILL IT BE LAW.
NOW LET ME SAY THIS WHILE WE WERE ANNOUNCING ON THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL WAVING THE AMERICAN FLAG ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS AND ALL THAT, THE REPUBLICANS WERE INSIDE WITH A HEARING TO SUE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR ENFORCING THE LAW.
Stephen: WHY SHOULDN'T YOU DO THAT? THEY WANTED THE PRESIDENT TO ROLL OUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, YOU KNOW, SWIFTLY, AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE WANTED. (LAUGHTER)
NO WHAT THEY WANTED WAS 50 TIMES THEY VOTED TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. BUT THEY'RE TALKING PROCESS. WE'RE TALKING PROGRESS, WE'RE TALKING JOBS, THEY'RE TALKING LAWSUITS.
Stephen: IF THE PRESIDENT IS BEING A TYRANT WHAT CHOICE DO THEY HAVE BUT TO TAKE HIM TO COURT. OBAMA CAN ALWAYS COUNTERSUE. EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON CAN GET MOBBED UP WITH LAWYERS AND WE'LL LET JUDGE JUDY DECIDE THE ENTIRE THING. (LAUGHTER) WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER NANCY PELOSI. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
