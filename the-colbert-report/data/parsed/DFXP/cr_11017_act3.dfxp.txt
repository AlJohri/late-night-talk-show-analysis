Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE ANCHOR OF NBC'S" MEET THE PRESS "AND THIS WEEKEND HIS GOATEE IS HOSTING "SNL." PLEASE WELCOME CHUCK TODD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ CHUCK, GOOD TO SEE YA!
HELLO.
Stephen: THIS IS THE THIRD TIME WE'VE HAD YOU ON THE SHOW, ONLY TWO OF WHICH HAVE BEEN BROADCASTED.
WELL, THERE YOU ARE.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON HOSTING "MEET THE PRESS."
WELL IT'S WEEK TO WEEK, LIKE AN NBA CONTRACT
Stephen: REALLY? YOU COULD BE GONE NEXT WEEK?
WELL THEY SIGNED ME FOR NEXT SUNDAY
Stephen:  BUT YOU'RE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOR THIS  JOB! YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT POLITICS! YOU HAVE THE HORSE RACE IN YOUR HEAD YOU KNOW ALL THE PLAYERS. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY KEEP YOU ON AMNIOTIC FLUID AT NIGHT LIKE THE PRECOGS FROM "MINORITY REPORT" AND YOU WAKE UP SCREAMING, VOTER POLLS! LOOKS GOOD FOR MCCONNELL! (LAUGHTER) DO YOU LOVE THE POLITICS?
I DO, I DO! IS IT OKAY?
Stephen: OF COURSE, IT'S OKAY! YOU HAVE TO BE PASSIONATE.
IT IS.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO HUG IT!
IT IS. I'VE LOVED IT SINCE I WAS A KID. I DON'T KNOW WHY.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE FIRST POLITICAL BATTLE YOU AS A KID -- I REMEMBER NIXON, I'M OLDER THAN YOU ARE. HOW OLD ARE YOU?
42.
Stephen: I'M YOUNGER THAN YOU ARE. THAT'S STRANGE (LAUGHTER) I REMEMBER NIXON. I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT WATERGATE. WHAT WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU THOUGHT, OH, I'M INTERESTED IN THAT?
IT WAS REAGAN-CARTER. I REMEMBER MY PARENTS DEBATING THAT.
Stephen: ONE FOR CARTER, ONE FOR REAGAN?
YES, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY WHICH.
Stephen: YOUR MOM WAS FOR REAGAN, YOUR DAD WAS FOR CARTER.
WHY ARE YOU DEMOGRAPHICALLY STEREOTYPING PEOPLE??
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT WE DO. I REMEMBER MY DAD JUST KEPT ACING A, B, C.
Stephen: WHAT'S THAT MEAN? AT THE TIME, ANYBODY BUT CARTER.
Stephen:  I THOUGHT IT WAS ALWAYS BE CLOSING
BUT I REMEMBER THAT AND I REMEMBER MY PARENTS HAVING INTERESTING DEBATES. THAT'S WHAT I GREW UP WITH. WAS GREAT.
Stephen: OKAY. YOU STILL LOVE THE POLITICS.
I STILL DO. POLITICIANS SOMETIMES AREN'T VERY GOOD.
Stephen: THIS IS A POLITICIAN.
OKAY.
Stephen: IS IN TROUBLE RIGHT NOW. OFF BOOK COMING OUT CALLED "THE STRANGER BARACK OBAMA IN THE WHITE HOUSE." NOW, THE MID-TERMS TOMORROW --
YES, YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT THEM, I CAN TELL.
Stephen: I AM MID-CITED ABOUT THEM.
DO YOU HAVE THE SIX YEAR ITCH?
Stephen: I DO. WHERE IS IT?
Stephen: IT'S MORE I HAVE SIX-YEAR SWAMP ASS (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING OUT OF THE GAME, BABY. I'M PULLING THE RIP CORD IN JUST A COUPLE OF SHOWS.
YEAH.
Stephen: BUT ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THE MID-TERMS OR READY TO GET TO 2016, LET'S FACE IT? ARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? WHO'S GOING TO WIN OR LOSE, ARE WHO CARES?
WELL, THE CYNIC IN ME --
Stephen: I'M ASKING A CYNIC I'M ASKING FOR A REALIST
WE'RE SPENDING $4 BILLION TO DECIDE IF IT'S HARRY REID OR MITCH MCCONNELL IN CHARGE OF THE FILIBUSTER. THIS HAS BEEN AN ELECTION WHERE THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CAMPAIGN AND DEBATE. IT'S AMAZING THE TOP TWO ISSUES, THE ECONOMY, GRIDLOCK IN WASHINGTON, AND I CAN'T FIND A CAMPAIGN IN AMERICA THAT'S ADDRESSING THE TWO ISSUES.
Stephen: IT'S ABOUT THIS GUY, ISN'T IT?
IT'S TURNED INTO THIS GUY? THE REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING WE HAVE TO STOP THAT GUY FROM DOING ANYTHING. I'M ALL FOR FIGHTING AGAINST THIS GUY, IT'S WHAT MY CAREER'S BEEN BASED ON FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS BUT WHY DID THE DEMOCRATS RUN AWAY FROM HIM? DIDN'T THAT SEEM WEEK?
THE REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING OBAMA IS TO BLAME FOR EVERYTHING -- THE GRIDLOCK AND THE BAD ECONOMY. THE DEMOCRATS SAY, OH, YOU'RE RIGHT, OBAMA IS NOT VERY GOOD. SO YOU'VE REINFORCED THE MESSAGE, OBAMA IS NOT VERY GOOD. THEN YOU ALSO HAVE A DEMOCRATIC BASE THAT STILL LIKES PRESIDENT OBAMA AND STILL DEMOCRATS WHO SUPPORT PRESIDENT OBAMA.
Stephen: THEY'RE CALLED BLACK PEOPLE.
IT'S NOT JUST AFRICAN-AMERICAN.
Stephen: REALLY? BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT'S NO WAY TO GET THEM FIRED UP ABOUT GOING TO THE POLLS. IF REPUBLICANS END UP SWEEPING ALL OF THIS, I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY WILL LOOK BACK AND REGRET
Stephen: I HAVE A LIVE SHOW TO DO TOMORROW.
I DO, TOO. WE'RE UP AGAINST EACH OTHER.
Stephen: BUT I'M GONNA TELL EVERYBODY TO WATCH YOU. COULD YOU JUST TELL ME NOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? I'D LOVE TO HAVE IT ALL WRITTEN.
ACTUALLY, IF WE KNOW BY 11:30, ITS MEANS IT'S A HUGE REPUBLICAN NIGHT. Stephen: WHAT'S MY EARLY INDICATION THAT I CAN START DRINKING?
NORTH CAROLINA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, IF THOSE ARE THE EARLY POLL CLOSINGS ON THE EAST COAST, IF ONE OF THOSE HAS GONE REPUBLICAN BEFORE MIDNIGHT, THE REPUBLICANS WILL WIN THE SENATE, THE QUESTION IS HOW BIG.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HOLD BOTH
Stephen: HOLD THE SENATE?
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HOLD THOSE SEATS. IT COULD TAKE UP TO JANUARY. I KNOW IT'S SO EXCITING AND YOU LOVE THEM SO MUCH THAT NOT ONLY COULD WE HAVE RECOUNTS, YOU LOVE THOSE, NOT ONLY WILL IT TAKE THE IDITAROD TO GET THE VOTE FROM THE BUSH COUNTRY TO FIND NOW ALASKA, SO WE'LL HAVE A RUNOFF IN LOUISIANA AND GEORGIA. WHY SHOULDN'T THEY LAST TILL 2015? THEY'RE VERY EXCITING
Stephen: IF I HAVE TO TALK MID-TERMS AFTER TOMORROW NIGHT I'M GOING TO GO TO MAINE AND START MAKING OUT WITH THAT NURSE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH CHUCK TODD, "MEET THE PRESS," "THE STRANGER." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
