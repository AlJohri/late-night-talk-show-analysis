( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A  NEW BIOGRAPHY ABOUT THE VAGINA. I'LL ASK FIREALLY HAVE TO READ  THE-- IN I REALLY HAVE TO READ  THE FORWARD BEFORE I JUMP IN. PLEASE WELCOME NAOMI WOLF  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING BACK. OKEY-DOKEY. LAST TIGHT YOU WERE HERE FIVE  YEARS AGO.
YEAH.
Stephen:  YOU WERE HERE--  YOU WERE HERE FOR THE BOOK "THE  END OF AMERICA."  OKAY. AT THE TIME YOU WERE LIKE  JEREMIAH ON THE MOUNTAIN TELLING  US WE WERE JUST A COUPLE OF  YEARS AWAY FROM A TOTALITARIAN POLICE STATE THAT WOULD CRUSH  ALL OF OUR RIGHTS. HOW DID YOU STOP IT? ( LAUGHTER )
WELL, WE HAD A LOT OF HELP.
Stephen:  NOW WE HAVE A  SOCIALIST COUNTRY. ( LAUGHTER )
YOU KNOW, ON THE LEFT AND ON  THE RIGHT, PEOPLE WANT TO CRUSH  LIBERTY. WE ALWAYS SEE THE SAME THING. SO I DON'T THINK ANY PARTY HAS A  MONOPOLY ON BAD BEHAVIOR.
Stephen:  IT DOESN'T MATTER  WHO WE ELECT. THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY VOTE FOR  ROMNEY.
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY THAT.
Stephen:  WELL, KIND OF.
WHAT MATTERS IS THE  CONSTITUTION, IN MY BOOK GLI  UNDERSTAND, OKAY. SPEAKING OF BOOKS, YOU HAVE A  NEW ONE HERE. IT'S CALLED "VAGINA:  A NEW  BIOGRAPHY. OF THEBIOGRAPHY.
YES IT IS.
Stephen:  I HAVE NO PROBLEM  WITH THAT. I'M A MATURE ADULT, VAGINA,  VAVINA, VAGINA.
THIS IS EXCELLENT. PEOPLE BLUSH IS THERE NOT ME.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
Stephen:  HOW'S THE VAGINA?
WELL... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  IT'S A FAIR QUESTION.
Stephen:  IT IS A FAIR  QUESTION.
IT'S A FIRE QUESTION.
Stephen:  IT'S THE FIRST  QUESTION, REALLY.
IT'S AN IDEAL QUESTION. IT TURNS OUT IT'S NOT DOING AS  WELL AS IT SHOULD IN OUR  CULTURE.
Stephen:  REALLY?
YES, INDEED, AND THIS WON'T  SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE. 40 YEARS INTO THE SEXUAL  REVOLUTION-- QUOTE, UNQUOTE--  THERE'S PORN EVERYWHERE, THERE'S  SEXUAL INFORMATION EVERYWHERE, BUT 30% OF WOMEN SELF-REPORT AS  A PROBLEM FOR THEM THAT THEY  HAVE LOW SEXUAL DESIRE AND  ANOTHER 30%, SOME OF THE SAME WOMEN, SOME DIFFERENT, THAT IT'S  A PROBLEM THAT THEY DON'T REACH  ORGASM WHEN THEY WANT TO.
Stephen:  WHAT'S THE DOWN  SIDE OF NOT GIVING YOUR VAGINA  THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES?
I WILL TELL YOU. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT.
Stephen:  IS THERE A DOWN  SIDE? FOR ME-- THE ONE THING I HAVE TO  SAY THAT THE VAGINA HAS IS  MYSTERY.
IT DOES HAVE MYSTERY.
Stephen:  OKAY, IT'S  MYSTERY. DO WE WANT TO REALLY DISPEL THE  MYSTERY. IT'S LIKE A DAN BROWN NOVEL. YOU KNOW? ( LAUGHTER )  IN THAT-- IN THAT-- IN THAT THE  POPE IS THE BAD GUY IN BOTH  STORIES. ( LAUGHTER ). ( APPLAUSE )    ( CHEERS )   AND I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW HOW  TOM HANKS FITS IN, BUT WE'LL  FIGURE IT OUT.
WELL, THIS-- PARDON ME--  MYSTERY AND ROMANCE ARE GOOD  THINGS BUT NOT KNOWING BASICS  ABOUT OUR ANATOMY AND SEXUAL RESPONSE BECAUSE OF OUTDATED  IDEAS ARE NOT SO GOOD. WE STILL TALK ABOUT THE  CLITORIS, AND THE G-SPOT.
Stephen:  I RARELY DO.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY  ON THE EDGES OF THEIR SEATS  WANTING TO KNOW WHAT IS COMING  NEXT SO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. ANATOMISTS HAVE FOUND A NEW  NEURAL ARM IN THE SWEARIOR WALL  OF THE FEMALE PELVIS --
Stephen:  THERE'S A WHOLE  ARM IN THERE.
IT'S A HORRIBLE EXPRESSION. IT'S A HORRIBLE EXPRESSION. ANYWAY, THERE'S A NEURAL  STRUCTURE, THE NORTH OF IT IS  THE CLITORIS, THE SOUTH OF IT IS  THE G-SPOT. THAT'S ONE STRUCTURE. BUT OVER 90% OF WOMEN IN LAB  CONDITIONS WITH STRANGERS,  REACHED ORGASM WHEN BOTH OF  THESE WERE STIMULATED AT THE SAME TIME.
Stephen:  REALLY? OKAY? WITH STRANGERS? ( LAUGHTER )  SO WHERE IS THIS LAB? ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  DO THEY NEED  VOLUNTEERS? NOW, ACTUALLY-- YOU WENT TO  SOMEBODY-- PART OF YOUR RESEARCH  YOU VISITED WHAT IS CALLED A  VAGINA HEALER.
WELL, HE DIDN'T CALL HIMSELF  THAT. BUT AS A REPORTER I DID  ENTERVIEW A GUY WHO IS AITANT  RICK HEAL WHO ARE HAS INCREDIBLE  OUTCOMES FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY REACHING ORGASM,  SEXUAL TRAUMA. WHAT HE'S DOING IS VERY, VERY  SUCCESSFUL.
Stephen:  WHAT'S HE DOING?
WELL, I WILL TELL YOU.
Stephen:  WELL, YOU'RE  TAKING YOUR TIME. ( LAUGHTER ).
IT TURNS OUT, THAT A LOT OF  THINGS ARE NOT RIGHT IN OUR  CULTURED SCRIPT ABOUT SEX.
Stephen:  NAOMI?
YES.
Stephen:  WHAT DID MIKE DO?
WELL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, YOU  DON'T BELIEVE THIS, BUT HE  TRAINS MEN TO DO WHAT HE CALLS  SPOT MASSAGE FOR AN HOUR AND A  HALF. AND I'M LIKE DO THESE PEOPLE NOT  HAVE JOBS? DO THEY NOT HAVE CHILDREN?
Stephen:  EXACTLY, DO YOU  PAY THIS GUY?
I DID NOT PAY. I WAS A REPORTER. I LEARNED A LOT FROM HIM.
Stephen:  OKAY, SO, HE JUST  DOES THIS OUT OF THE GOODNESS ON  HIS HEART? LIKE IT SAYS ON THE SIDE OF MY  VAN. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  I'M THE VAGINA WHISPERER. ( LAUGHTER )  I LOVE IT. I JUST DO. NAOMI, THANK YOU SO MUCH. NAOMI WOLF. "VAGINA:  A NEW BIOGRAPHY.
