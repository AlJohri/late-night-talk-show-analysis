Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. FOLKS, IF I KNOW MY NATION I  DON'T HAVE TO REMIND ANYBODY  AMERICA'S THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH. WHY? IT'S BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE GREATEST BEST PEOPLE ON  EARTH. THERE'S ME, THERE'S YOU, THE LIST GOES  ON. BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE GREATEST WORST  PEOPLE ON EARTH  BECAUSE AMERICA  PUTS MORE OF ITS CITIZENS IN PRISON THAN ANY OTHER NATION. WE ARE NUMBER ONE WITH A BULLET  ALSO NUMBER ONE WITH AN OUNCE IN YOUR POCKET  BUT CONFINING SO MANY AMERICANS COMES AT A  TERRIBLE PRICE, WHICH IT TURNS  OUT IS MONEY. THE AVERAGE COST OF INCARCERATING A FEDERAL INMATE IN 2011 WAS ALMOST $29,000. AND IN NEW YORK CITY THE COST PER INMATE WAS $168,000.  THOUGH A BROKER WILL TELL YOU THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD DEAL FOR A  6 BY 10 STUDIO WITH EAT-IN TOILET. FORTUNATELY THERE'S A WAY TO SHIV SOME OF THOSE COSTS IN THE  KIDNEYS, AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. DEBT OR PRISON? FOLKS, OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS  FOUND SO MANY WAYS TO CUT  CORNERS. FOR INSTANCE, ELIMINATING  NONESSENTIALS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNORS IN UTAH,  IDAHO, TEXAS, INDIANA AND  ARIZONA HAVE REFUSED FEDERAL  FUNDING FOR THE PRISON RAPE  ELIMINATION ACT. THAT REMINDS ME ON AN OLD JOKE. TWO PRISONERS ARE IN THE SHOWER AND ONE OF THEM DROPS THE SOAP SO THE OTHER GUY SAYS  "WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN IS  FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE TO  PREVENT." BUT THE SAVINGS DON'T  STOP AT NOT PREVENTING SEXUAL ASSAULT. THERE'S ALSO CHEAP LABOR. THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS RELYING ON TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DETAINED IMMIGRANTS TO WORK IN DETENTION CENTERS COOKING MEALS, SCRUBBING SHOWERS AND  BUFFING HALLWAYS, USUALLY FOR A DOLLAR A DAY OR LESS. SOME ARE EVEN PAID WITH JUST  CANDY BARS  I KNOW, THAT SOUNDS BAD BUT  THEIR NEXT PAYDAY COULD BE A  HUNDRED GRAND. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S WIN-WIN. IT'S WIN-WIN. THEY COME TO OUR COUNTRY TO  STEAL OUR JOBS SO WE ARREST THEM AND FORCE THEM TO DO OUR JOBS. IT CANNOT BE ENOUGH JUST TO SAVE MONEY. PRISONS NEED TO TURN A PROFIT  AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WE'RE  WELL ON THE WAY AS REPORTED BY  ANOTHER CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE  FINANCED BY TAXPAYERS, N.P.R. AFTER A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION, NIPPER HAS FOUND THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY DEFENDANTS CAN BE BILLED FOR A PUBLIC DEFENDER, FOR THEIR OWN PROBATION, AND PAROLE SUPERVISION  FOR THE ELECTRONIC MONITORING DEVICES THEY'RE ORDERED TO WEAR AND EVEN CHARGED ROOM AND BOARD FOR PRISON STAYS. AND THE  BEST PART IS, THESE FEES ARE  SELF-SUSTAINING INVESTMENTS.
ON A TYPICAL DAY, ABOUT 25% OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY JAIL ARE THERE NOT FOR THEIR MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES BUT BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO PAY THE COURT COSTS AND FEES
Stephen: IT'S A GREAT SYSTEM. IF THE DEFENDANT CANT PAY THE FEE, THEY'LL GO TO JAIL WHERE THEY'LL  RACK UP MORE FOOD AND BOARDING FEES THAT THEY CAN'T PAY AND BE PENALIZED WITH MORE JAIL TIME, THUS INCREASING THEIR DEBT WHICH  GIVES THEM  LONGER PRISON SENTENCES. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, DON'T DO THE CRIME IF YOU CAN'T DO THE  TIME OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DIME WHICH IS A CRIME RESULTING IN MORE TIME. AND THESE FEES ARE RESULTING IN SERIOUS SENTENCES FOR THE POOR. A JUDGE IN GEORGIA RECENTLY SENTENCED A MAN TO 12 MONTHS  IN JAIL FOR FAILING TO PAY HIS COURT FEES. THAT SOUNDS HARSH  BUT THIS GUY TERRORIZED THE COMMUNITY  BY STEALING A CAN OF BEER WORTH  LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS. HEY, IF THIS GUY WANTED TO STAY OUT OF JAIL HE SHOULD HAVE STUCK TO PETTY CRIME. FOLKS, I BELIEVE THIS IS A GREAT START. IT'S A BABY STEP. BUT WE'RE MISSING OUT ON ALL KINDS  OF OTHER CHARGE-PORTUNITIES. FOR INSTANCE, WHAT ABOUT WOMEN'S PRISON. THEY SHOULD INCLUDE AN  ENTERTAINMENT FEE BECAUSE  AFTER ALL, THEY'RE WATCHING A LIVE  PRESENTATION OF  ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK. AND DEATH ROW INMATES. DEATH ROW INMATES ALWAYS REQUEST LAST MEALS BUT WHY SHOULD THEY  BE ALLOWED TO SKIP OUT ON THE  CHECK. AND IF CRIMINALS THINK GETTING  TASED STINGS, WAIT UNTIL THEY  GET THE ELECTRICITY BILL. NOW, SOME MAY SAY THAT JAILING  PEOPLE OVER THEIR DEBT MAKES POVERTY INTO A CRIME. IF THAT'S TRUE MAYBE WE SHOULD CUT OUT    THE MIDDLE MAN AND PUT  ALL POOR PEOPLE IN JAIL. OF COURSE, THIS WILL REQUIRE NEW PRISON FACILITIES WHICH WE CAN  BUILD USING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T PAY THEIR PRISON FEES. NOT AS WORKERS, AS THE BRICKS. I SAY WE JUST STACK THEM UP IN A CUBE AND LEAVE AN OPENING TO  CRAM MORE IN AND LOCK UP AND  THROW AWAY WHICHEVER PRISONER IS THE KEY BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY  WAY TO COVER THE RISING COST OF  PRISON BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON  NO MATTER HOW MANY POOR PEOPLE  WE THROW IN JAIL IT KEEPS  GETTING OVERCROWDED. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
