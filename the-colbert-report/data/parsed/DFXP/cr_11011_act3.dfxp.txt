WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT DIRECTED A NEW FILM DEAR WHITE PEOPLE. PLEASE WELCOME JUSTIN SIMIEN. MR. SIMIEN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
THANK YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
VERY GOOD TO BE HERE.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
VERY HEADY TIME FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.
IT IS A HEADY TIME.
ARE YOU A WRITER, DIRECTOR PRODUCER OF THE FILM DEAR WHITE PEOPLE.
THAT IS TRUE.
IT WON THE SPECIAL JURY AWARD FOR BREAKTHROUGH TALENT AT THE 2014 SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL AND EARNED YOU A SPOT IN VARIETY MAGAZINE'S TEN DIRECTORS TO WATCH.
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO KNOW THAT VARIETY MAGAZINE HAS OFFICIALLY SAID KEEP AN EYE ON THAT BLACK GUY.
IT'S A LITTLE SCARY, MAN, I LIVE IN THE AGE OF TWITTER SOAR PEOPLE HAVE GOT MY TWITTER HANDLE. THEY CAN FIGURE OUT EASILY WHERE I LIVE, WHAT MY MOVEMENTS ARE. SO I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT'S NICE, IT'S AN HONOR AND IT'S KIND OF SURREAL TO GET ALL OF THAT IN MY FIRST FILM. IT'S CRAZY, I'M GRATEFUL.
SO WHY'D YOU MAKE THE FILM? IT'S CALLED DEAR WHITE PEOPLE  IS IT A LOVE LETTER TO WHITE PEOPLE?
IT IS CALLED DEAR WHITE PEOPLE BUT THE MOVIE ITSELF ISN'T A RANT TO WHITE PEOPLE. IT ACTUALLY FOCUSES ON THESE FOUR BLACK KIDS AT A MOSTLY WHITE COLLEGE, SORT OF FIGURING OUT THEIR IDENTITIES. AND THERE IS A CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE HER NAME IS SAM. SHE'S GOT A RADIO SHOW CALLED DEAR WHITE PEOPLE. SHE'S A BIT OF A REBEL ROUSER AND CALLS PEOPLE OUT ON THEIR MICROAGGRESSION.
Stephen: WHAT'S A MICROAGGRESSION.
SORT OF THE FAUX PAUS, LIKE BEING SHOCKED THAT A BLACK PERSON IS ARTICULATE, YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE LIKE, YOU KNOW, AN AFRO AND YOU FIND WHITE FINGERS IN IT ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: DOES THAT HAPPEN?
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. ARE THEY HIDING THINGS IN THERE. WHY ARE THERE FINGERS IN THERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR, CULTURE MAYBE, I DIDN'T KNOW.
Stephen: I HAVE A CLIP HERE, THE YOUNG LADY IS IN THE DINING HALL OF THE-- IS IT THE DINING HALL THAT IS PREDOMINANTLY.
PREDOMINANTLY BLACK RESIDENCE HALL AND THERE IS A CHARACTER NAMED CURT WHO SORT OF HEADS UP A MAGAZINE ON CAMPUS AND HE DOESN'T REALLY TAKE TOO KINDLY TO SAM'S SHOW DEAR WHITE PEOPLE AND HE LETS HER KNOW IT.
OKAY, TAKE A LOOK.
DEAR WHITE PEOPLE, RIGHT?
IT'S FUNNY STUFF, HOW HAVE WE NOT-- YOU YET.
YOU UNINSPIRED HUMAN MAGAZINE.
IT IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE THAN JUST A MAGAZINE, SWEETHEART. IT IS BASICALLY HALF LAMPOON, SAME GOES TO THE NETWORK COMEDIES.
AND WHAT GIVES YOU CLUBHOUSE KIDS THE RIGHT TO COME TO OUR DINING HALL?
YOU KNOW,-- LIZ'S HERE.
SO HE CAN'T EAT HERE.
LET THE MAN EAT.
WHO ARE YOU TO THROW ME OUT?
WELL, I THINK I'M HEAD OF THIS HOUSE. AND I'M DOING THINGS MY WAY. (APPLAUSE)
IT'S A POWERFUL SCENE.
THANK YOU.
WHY MAKE A COMEDY ABOUT RACISM?
I DON'T THINK RACISM IS FUNNY. THAT'S WHERE YOU AND I DIFFER.
YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T ACTUALLY SEE THE MOVIE AS BEING ABOUT RACISM PER SE. RACISM SORT OF EXISTS IN THE WORLD OF ANY PERSON OF COLOR.
SO MICROAGGRESSIONS ARE NOT THE SAME THING AS RACISM?
IT'S COVERT RACISM, SORT OF RACISM HIDDEN UNDER THE SURFACE BUT THE MOVIE FOCUS ON IDENTITY IT FOCUS ON THESE KIDS IN A WORLD WHERE MICROAGGRESSIONS AND COVERT RACISM OCCUR. AND TALKED ABOUT KIND OF THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING YOURSELF IN A PLACE THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REFLECT YOU.
IS THIS AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL STORY, DID YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A PLACE THAT DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU?
AMERICA, GENERALLY SPEAKING, BUT THERE ARE-- .
Stephen: AMERICA NUMBER ONE, THOUGH, USA NUMBER ONE.
IT'S THE BEST, IT'S GREAT. BUT IT'S JUST WORKING ON SOME THINGS TOO. BESIDES PUTTING MY HAND IN YOUR FRO, IS THERE OTHER MICROAGGRESSIONS I SHOULD AVOID. BECAUSE I WANT TO BE FRIENDLY WITH BLACK PEOPLE. I HAVE MANY BLACK FRIENDS.
OKAY.
I THINK WE HAVE SOME PICTURES OF ME WITH SOME OF MY BLACK FRIENDS OVER THE YEARS.
OH, WOW, THAT'S GOOD.
YEAH.
WOW, YEAH, YOU HAVE MORE BLACK FRIENDS THAN I DO, I THINK. SO CONGRATULATIONS.
Stephen: OH REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: THANK YOU. (APPLAUSE)
GOOD JOB, MAN. I THINK IT'S A START. I THINK IT'S A START. I THINK PART OF IT IS IT'S NOT MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR RACE. YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT THAT YOU HAVE BLACK FRIENDS. I DON'T THINK IT ABSOLUTELY ABSOLVES YOU OF THE TOPIC OF RACISM OR BEING ABLE TO STICK YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND.
Stephen: OKAY, WHY HAVE THESE PICTURES OF ME WITH BLACK PEOPLE IF IT'S NOT TO ABSOLVE ME OF RACISM, I DON'T PUT THESE PICTURES UP HERE FOR MY HEALTH.
OH, WOW, OKAY.
Stephen: IT'S TO PROVE I'M NOT A RACIST.
I THINK WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE FRIENDS JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKE THEM.
Stephen: OF COURSE I LIKE THEM. I ALSO LIKE THAT I GET TO SHOW THE PICTURES.
YEAH. WE DO LIVE IN THE AGE OF THE SELFIE WHERE IT IS NICE TO SHOW OFF BUT I DON'T THINK A PERSON NECESSARILY WANTS TO BE A PROP IN YOUR LIFE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. I THINK PEOPLE SORT OF WANT TO BE YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU GENUINELY LIKE THEM.
Stephen: SNOOP SEEMS HAPPY.
YEAH, HE DOES.
Stephen: NOW THESE ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE ABOUT PEOPLE BASED UPON THEIR APPEARANCE, ARE THEY NECESSARILY RACIAL OR IS IT A MICROAGGRESSION FOR ME TO LOOK AT THE TWEED AND THE PLAID AND GO THAT GUY SAY NERD.
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE ACCURATE.
Stephen: IT WOULD BE? THAT IS NOT A MICROAGGRESSION. IT IS A MICROIDENTIFICATION.
I'M A HUGE NERD.
Stephen: YOU SELF-IDENTIFY AS NERD.
I DO AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH THAT.
Stephen: I THINK YOU ALSO IDENTIFY AS GAY.
IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: IS THERE ANY CHANCE YOU MIGHT GENTRIFYING YOURSELF OUT OF YOUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD?
IT'S A CHANCE.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
IT'S A CHANCE. THANKS, MAN.
Stephen: JUSTIN SIMIEN, THE MOVIE IS DEAR WHITE PEOPLE. OPENS OCTOBER 17th THIS FRIDAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
