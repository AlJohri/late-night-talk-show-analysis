EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. BEFORE THE BREAK -- RIGHT BEFORE  THE COMMERCIAL BREAK I TOLD YOU  ALL ABOUT ONE OR TWO ISSUES THAT MARCO RUBIO HAD WITH HIS  RESPONSE TO THE STATE OF THE  UNION, BUT THOSE PROBLEMS WERE ONLY DURING HIS ENGLISH SPEECH. HE ALSO MADE HISTORY LAST NIGHT  BUT BECOMING THE FIRST PERSON TO  REBUT THE PRESIDENT IN SPANISH BECAUSE MARCO RUBIO ISN'T JUST  THE REPUBLICAN SAVIOR, HE'S ALSO [SPEAKING SPANISH] HE IS  HIS-SPANISH AND HE IS THE  G.O.P.'S NEWEST OUTREACH TO  LATINO VOTERS. UP UNTIL NOW THEY HAD TO RELY ON  SECOND LINDSEY GRAHAM OUT ON A  DONKEY PAINTED LIKE A ZEBRA. THE SPANISH SPEECH WAS A HUGE  SUCCESS BECAUSE AT NO POINT DID  HE LUNG FOR [SPEAKING SPANISH] BUT HERE IS SOMETHING ODD, IT  TURNS OUT HIS SPANISH SPEECH WAS  FOUR MINUTES LONGER THAN THE ENGLISH VERSION. I GOT TOP WONDERING WHAT WAS IN  THE EXTRA FOUR MINUTES? WAS HE MAKING FUN OF LOS  GRINGOS? WAS HE SENDING THE SECRET SIGNAL  TO HAVE THE BUS BOYS CUT OUR  THROATS DURING DESSERT? IT'S COMING. YES, THAT'S WHY I DON'T ORDER  DESSERT. I ORDER IT TO GO. [LAUGHTER] I FOUND THE SPANISH VERSION OF  HIS SPEECH IN ONE OF FEW PLACES  IT WAS AVAILABLE ABCNEWS.COM AND I TURNED ON THE CLOSED  CAPTIONING TO GET THE  TRANSLATION. THIS IS THE ACTUAL  TRANSPORTATION THAT PLAYS WITH  ABC'S VIDEO. JIM? [SPEAK SPANISH]
Stephen: I'M AT THE BODY IN  THE HOMELESS OF AUGUST TO PAY  THUGS AND WHAT IS THE HAMAS YOU'VE GOT THE ABLE NOT BECAUSE  I WAS OF THEM. I'LL GET THE PANELING AND SOAP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WOW. WOW. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE WHEN  IT'S BEING FON DPHONETICALLY  TRANSSCRIBED BY A COMPUTER THAT THINKS SPANISH IS ENGLISH. IT GOES OVER MY HEAD BUT I  UNDERSTAND HIM WHEN HE SAID WHEN  IT OFTEN SAID MICHAEL MR. INTO. PRESIDENT OBAMA, FOLKS,  PRESIDENT OBAMA MAY BE THE  DEMOCRATS MLK BUT MARCO RUBIO IS THE REPUBLICANS ELLEN GINSBURG  ON PAYOTE. THAT'S WHY RUBIO IS SO IMPORTANT  TO REPUBLICANS. HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SPEAK  DIRECTLY TO LA HENCEHISPANIA OR  AS IT WOULD BE TRANSSCRIEND BRUCE HANNAH. FOR SENIORS. AT BUT IT HINT THAT IT WOULD LOT  OF LEPROSY AND THE BUSH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND FOR STUDENTS BURIED WITH  LOAN DEBT SORT OF OF COURSE THE  HUMAN FECES PREDICAMENT TO WHICH WE HAVE BEEN CHAMPIONED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND FOR ALL OF YOU UNEMPLOYED  FRET NOT BECAUSE SLOPE THIS  YOUNG DONOVAN'S RIPPLES IF I HAD THE MUSCLES. I MEAN WHAT -- WHAT BETTER  VISION FOR AMERICA? MARCO RUBIO TRULY IS THE G.O.P. SAVIOR. I CAN ALREADY SEE HIS CAMPAIGN  SLOGAN FOR 2016 MARCO RUBIO HOP
