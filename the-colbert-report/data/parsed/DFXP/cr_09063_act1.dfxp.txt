. ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [EAGLE CAW] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT. [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN!"] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I THINK  THAT THIS WORLD WOULD BE A MUCH  BETTER PLACE IF I COULD TAKE THAT KIND OF ENERGY, PUT IT IN A  PAPER BAG AND HUFF IT. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD PRESIDENTS'  DAY WEEKEND. I TOOK AN ALL-EXPENSE PAID TRIP  TO CRAP-MY-PANTS-ISTAN  BECAUSE LAST FRIDAY THIS  HAPPENED.
A TEN TON METEOR RACING AT  33,000 MILES PER HOUR THROUGH  THE ATMOSPHERE STREEKD OVER A RUSSIAN CITY 900 MILES OF EAST  OF MOSCOW BEFORE EXPLODING OF  BLINDING BRIGHT LIGHT SAID TO HAVE THE POWER OF AN ATOMIC  BOMB.
ITS REMINDED ME OF ACTION  MOVIES LIKE-TERM NATEOR 4 THIS  WITNESS SAID.
Stephen: YES, THIS FIREBALL  WAS JUST LIKE "TERMINATOR 4 "  EXCEPT PEOPLE SAW IT. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THE EARTH IS UNDER ATTACK  FROM GIANT SPACE ROCKS. THE DINOSAURS TRIED TO  WARN US BY BEING DEAD. [LAUGHTER] NOW, ALL WEEKEND I WAS DOWN IN  THE BUNKER WATCHING THESE  INCREDIBLE YOUTUBE CLIPS OF THE METEOR STREAKING ACROSS THE SKY  AND EXPLODING. IT'S ACTUALLY REPLACED MY  PREVIOUS FAVORITE VIDEO:  AN ADORABLE KITTEN  STREAKING ACROSS THE SKY AND EXPLODING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHY IS THERE SO MUCH VIDEO OF  THE METEOR? FOR THE ANSWER, LET'S GO TO THE  VIDEO.
A MAJORITY OF THIS  FOOTAGE WAS RECORDED PURELY BY  CHANCE. CAPTURED BY SMALL, DASH-MOUNTED  CAMERAS THAT ARE NOW THE LATEST  FAD AMONG RUSSIAN CAR OWNERS. MOTORISTS HAVE TURNED TO DASH  CAMS FOR SELF-PROTECTION, VISUAL  PROOF TO FEND OFF CHARGES FROM POSSIBLY CORRUPT POLICE OFFICERS  AND FROM INSURANCE SCAMMERS, WHO  OFTEN STAGE ACCIDENTS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: NOW THAT MAN LOST  HIS PERSONAL INJURY LAWSUIT, BUT  HE DID WIN THE COVETED SCAMMIE AWARD FOR BEST ACTOR ON A SEDAN. [LAUGHTER] BUT HERE IS THE SCARY PART. HERE IS THE SCARY PART, FOLKS,  WE DID NOT SEE THIS METEOR  COMING. SO CLEARLY, WE'RE ALL GONNA  DIE IN A RAIN OF FIRE IF WE  DON'T RESPOND TO THIS WAKEUP  CALL. FORTUNATELY, NASA'S ON THIS ONE. THEY HAVE SCRAMBLED TO IMPROVE  OUR ASTEROID DETECTION PROGRAM. BECAUSE, EVIDENTLY, THEIR  PREVIOUS ASTEROID PROGRAM HASN'T  BEEN UPDATED SINCE THE 1980s. [LAUGHTER] I WAS GOOD. I WAS REALLY GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] SO CLEARLY, NASA NOW HAS A  LASER-LIKE FOCUS ON PREVENTING  CATACLYSMIC METEOR STRIKES. SO LET'S CHECK IN WITH THE  ACTUAL FOOTAGE THEY RELEASED  YESTERDAY FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION-- THE FIRST  AND ONLY LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST  TERROR FROM THE SKY.
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO,  WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP OUR  TORTILLA, GET OUR PEANUT BUTTER, SQUIRT IT ON THE TORTILLA, GET  THE HONEY SQUIRT THAT ON THERE,  AND WE WILL HAVE A PEANUT BUTTER AND HONEY SANDWICH IN SPACE. HMM-- NOT TOO BAD. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: OH WELL. IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING, THE  WORLD ENDS NOT WITH A BANG, BUT  WITH A LIGHT SNACK. [LAUGHTER] NATION, FOUR YEARS AGO-- THANKS  TO OBAMA'S SOCIALIST POLICIES--  THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE BOTTOMED OUT AT LESS THAN 6500. BUT TODAY-- NO THANKS TO OBAMA'S  SOCIALIST POLICIES-- THE DOW IS  BACK!
A HISTORY-MAKING DAY ON WALL  STREET.
THE DOW INDUSTRIALS AS WELL  AS THE S&P 500 CLOSED AT THEIR  HIGHEST POINT IN FIVE YEARS. THE DOW ENDED JUST UNDER 14,036.
Stephen: 14,036. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, 14,036 DO  YOU UNITS. DOWNTONS? I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT  THAT MEANS. DO I? [LAUGHTER] I DON'T, GOOD. AND AMERICA HAS GOT A LOT TO  SHOW FOR ALL THAT DOW-ING.
ONE WAY TO LOOK AT THE STOCK  MARKET IS AS A GIANT,  WEALTH-CREATION MACHINE, AND IT HAS JUST CREATED A LOT OF  WEALTH. WE ARE NOW OFFICIALLY AT  THE COUNTRY'S ALL-TIME PEAK OF  MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES.
Stephen: YES, WE ARE AT PEAK  BILLIONAIRE. [LAUGHTER] PARTLY DUE TO TAX POLICIES THAT  FAVOR THE BILLIONAIRE SUPER  RICH, AND PARTLY DUE TO CLONING THEMSELVES FOR SPARE  PARTS. LAX LA. [LAUGHTER] AND NOW THAT WE ULTRA-LOADED ARE  SO NUMEROUS AGAIN, I'M GONNA  GIVE THE MONEYED MASSES THE NEWS THEY CAN USE---  THIS IS COLBERT PLATINUM! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ♪ ♪  A QUICK REMINDER: THIS SEGMENT  IS FOR PLATINUM MEMBERS ONLY. SO IF YOUR PERSONAL FOOD TASTER  DOESN'T HAVE A PERSONAL TRAINER,  WHY DON'T YOU RUN ALONG AND SEE IF YOUR LOCAL VALPAK HAS  COUPON FOR IRREGULAR HAMBURGER  MEAT? [LAUGHTER] OKAY, THEY'RE GONE. PLATINUM NATION, AS THE RANKS OF  US SUPERRICH CONTINUE TO SWELL,  YOU NEED A RIDE THAT SAYS "SUCK ON MY MONEY SACK," TASTEFULLY. [LAUGHTER] NOW, YOU'VE GOT YOUR  ROLLS, YOUR MAYBACH, YOUR ASTIN  MARTIN. BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TURN  HEADS YOU'LL NEED THE 2013  PAGANI HUAYRA, AN ULTRA-LUXURY SPORTS CAR THAT CAN GO 230 MILES  AN HOUR WITH A PRICE TAG OF  $1.2 MILLION. [AUDIENCE OOHHS] IT'S A VEHICLE OF SUCH PRESTIGE,  THAT THE  SIDE MIRRORS READ:  WARNING: PEOPLE IN MIRROR ARE JUST OBJECTS. DON'T WORRY ABOUT HITTING THEM. [LAUGHTER] BUT THE REAL ATTRACTION FOR THE  PLATINUM AMERICAN IS THE UNIQUE  FEATURE THAT MAKES OF THE HUAYRA SO RARE.
EIGHTEEN AMERICANS HAVE  BOUGHT HUAYRAS. THE FIRST DELIVERY IS SCHEDULED  FOR JULY. THAT IS IF, AND THIS IS A  BIG IF, THE CAR IS LEGAL. RIGHT NOW, THE HUAYRA IS NOT  APPROVED BY THE TRANSPORTATION  DEPARTMENT FOR U.S. ROADS.
Stephen: YOU CANNOT DRIVE  IT. WHICH MAKES IT THE ULTIMATE  LUXURY. ANY SCHMO CAN OWN A CAR  THAT CAN TAKE YOU SOME PLACE. BUT ONLY THE TRUE ELITE CAN  AFFORD A $1.2 MILLION CUPHOLDER. JUST IMAGINE HOW MUCH YOU'LL  ENJOY RUBBING IT IN YOUR  FRIENDS' FACES, PROVIDED THEY GIVE YOU A RIDE TO THEIR HOUSE  FIRST. [LAUGHTER] AND PLATINUM NATION, SPEND IT  WHILE YOU CAN, BECAUSE  CALIFORNIA'S NEW TAX PLAN FOR THE WEALTHY HAS ALREADY CLAIMED  ONE CASUALTY.
PHIL MICKELSON, HE'S  CALIFORNIA BASED AND HE'S HAD IT  WITH TAXES. HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO TAKE  DRASTIC ACTION BECAUSE HIS TAX  RATE IS 63%. MIKELSON'S GOING TO TAKE DRASTIC  ACTION! AND IN PRO GOLF, THAT COULD MEAN  CARRYING HIS OWN PUTTER! [LAUGHTER] BUT HE'S GOT NO CHOICE. HE MAKES ONLY $60 MILLION A  YEAR. AND CALIFORNIA'S RAISED HIS  TAXES 3%. SO MICKELBACK IS CONSIDERING  MOVING OUT OF CALIFORNIA OR EVEN  RETIRING ALTOGETHER. I WARNED YOU THAT THESE TAX  HIKES WOULD CAUSE OUR BEST AND  BRIGHTEST TO TAKE THEIR TALENTS  ELSEWHERE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF PHIL  MICKELSON ISN'T HERE TO WIN  THOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS? SOMEONE ELSE WILL! [LAUGHTER] IS THAT SUDDENLY OKAY?! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LUCKILY FOR GUYS LIKE PHIL AND  ME,  THERE MAY SOON BE A NEW  COMMUNITY WHERE HIGH EARNERS ARE SAFE. AND IT'S IN THE LAST PLACE  YOU'D THINK: DETROIT. SURE, WE ALL KNOW THE MOTOR CITY  HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS. LIKE SAY, DURING THE ICE AGE. [LAUGHTER] BUT IT'S NOT ALL BAD. TAKE BELLE ISLE, A THOUSAND-ACRE  ISLAND AND PUBLIC PARK THAT MANY  CONSIDER THE JEWEL OF DETROIT. IT'S NO SURPRISE, "BELLE" MEANS  "BEAUTIFUL," AND "ISLE" MEANS  "NOT CONNECTED TO DETROIT." [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] AND NOW -- [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND NOW, IT'S ABOUT TO GET  BETTER, THANKS TO LIBERTARIAN  REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER AND DOUBLY-NAMED PORN STAR ROD  LOCKWOOD WHO PLANS TO BUY THE  ISLAND FROM DETROIT  AND CONVERT IT INTO AN INDEPENDENT COMMONWEALTH  "FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF  LIMITED GOVERNMENT, WHERE RESIDENTS WOULD NOT PAY ANY  CORPORATE OR INCOME TAXES."  FINALLY, A CONSEQUENCE-FREE PARADISE FOR RICH AMERICANS,  OTHER THAN THE REST OF AMERICA. [LAUGHTER] THIS HAVEN FOR THE WEALTHY IS  THE REALIZATION OF A DREAM FROM  LOCKWOOD'S SELF-PUBLISHED NOVEL, ALSO CALLED "BELLE ISLE," IN THE  TRADITION OF OTHER FICTIONAL TAX  SHELTERS LIKES "NARNIA" AND "WHERE THE WILD THINGS HIDE  THEIR ASSETS." [LAUGHTER] AND THIS PLAN DOESN'T JUST HELP  THE WEALTHY, IT BENEFITS THE  ENTIRE CITY OF DETROIT.
DETROIT'S BEEN IN DECLINE FOR  60 YEARS. THIS WOULD BE A GAME-CHANGER FOR  DETROIT BECAUSE IT WOULD ATTRACT  35,000 OR MORE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY FOR  $1 BILLION FROM THE CITY OF  DETROIT, WHICH WOULD REALLY HELP DETROIT.
Stephen: YES, YES, GREATLY  HELP DETROIT. BECAUSE WHAT THEY REALLY NEEDS  IS A PRISTINE PRIVATE ISLAND  THAT THEY CAN SEE FROM THE BARS OF THEIR  POST-INDUSTRIAL HELLSCAPE. SO THANK YOU, ROD LOCKWOOD, FOR  SHOWING THE PEOPLE OF DETROIT  THAT WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS TAKE THE LEMONS TO YOUR OWN  ISLAND SO YOU CAN DON'T HAVE TO  SHARE THE LEMONADE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELL, THAT'S IT FOR COLBERT  PLATINUM. JOIN ME NEXT TIME WHEN I  SHOW YOU HOW TO TURN A WALDORF  SALAD INTO A WAITER LOSING HIS JOB. I SAID NO GREEN APPLES! [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪
