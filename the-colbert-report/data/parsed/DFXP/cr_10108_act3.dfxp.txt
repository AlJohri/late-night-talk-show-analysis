Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT CREATED "MAD MEN." WE'LL HE'S ABOUT TO MEET ANGRY MAN. PLEASE WELCOME MATTHEW WEINER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY! GREAT TO SEE YOU!
GREAT TO BE HERE. .
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD, HOW ARE YOU? .
Stephen: I'M FINE, I'M A LITTLE EXCITED THAT YOU'RE HERE. I'M A LITTLE SAD ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE END OF "MAD MEN" HERE. THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEVENTH AND FINAL SEASON ENDS MAY 25, AND THE SECOND HALF OF THE FINAL SEASON IS NEXT YEAR.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT'S OCCASIONALLY KNOWN IN TV AS "NEXT SEASON."
YES.
Stephen: OKAY, SO WAS IT YOUR IDEA OR THE NETWORK'S TO SPLIT THE SEASON IN HALF AND -- MILK IT? (LAUGHTER) DOES DON WORK ON A DAIRY FARM IN THE FINAL EPISODE? WHY BREAK IT IN HALF?
THEY DID THIS WITH "BREAKING BAD." THEY SPLIT THE LAST TWO SEASONS FOR AN ORGANIC REASON WHICH IS THAT VINCE COULDN'T MAKE THE SCHEDULE, SO THEY HAD EIGHT ONE YEAR AND EIGHT THE NEXT YEAR AND THE SHOW BUILT IN A HUGE WAY.
Stephen: IT'S BEEN ON FOR SEVEN SEASONS. LET ME SEE IF I CAN DESCRIBE WHAT HAS HAPPENED, OKAY? LET ME SUMMARIZE IT. DON SMOKED, BANGED EVERYTHING ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD, AND CALIFORNIA, SOLD SOME SOAP, WAS GRIM ABOUT IT. AND SMOKED SOME MORE. IS HE A CRITICISM OF THE AMERICAN MALE? BECAUSE I'M AN AMERICAN MALE AND SHOULD BY TAKING THIS PERSONALLY?
I DON'T THINK IT'S MEANT AS A NEGATIVE THING. I ALWAYS SORT OF THOUGHT THAT HE WAS ABOUT THE SORT OF SPLIT MESSAGE THAT THE AMERICAN MALE GETS, THAT YOU ARE TOLD THAT YOU -- TO BE ATTRACTIVE -- ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE TO BE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, LITTLE LEAGUE COACH AND, LIKE, P.T.A. GUY, GREAT HUSBAND, GREAT DAD. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SMOKE AS MUCH, DRINK AS MUCH AND GET LAID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
Stephen: AND GET THE OTHER GUY.
AND BE CARNIVOROUS IN BUSINESS.
Stephen: RIGHT. THOSE TWO THINGS, I'M ALWAYS SURPRISED HOW MUCH PEOPLE GET OFF ON HIM WINNING, BUT I DON'T JUDGE HIM AT ALL. NONE OF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A JUDGEMENT OF THE AUDIENCE.
Stephen: I WAS AFRAID HE WAS JUDGING ME. WHEN THE SHOW STARTED, HE WAS A SHINY OBJECT, FUN, SEXY, BUT AS IT GOES ON, HE BECOMES AN EVEN MORE COMPLEX CHARACTER. WHY PRESENT SOMETHING COMPLEX? WHY CAN'T I JUST BE KIND OF FUN AND SEXY, YOU KNOW, GOOD LOOKING GUY AND THEN TAKE ALL THAT INNER LIFE AND JUST KEEP IT DOWN UNTIL ONE DAY IT JUST KILLS ME AND THEN, YOU KNOW, MY LOVED ONES READ MY LETTERS AND CRY FOREVER? (LAUGHTER) THAT IS A SERIES.
WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS A GOOD SERIES.
Stephen: THIS IS 1969. YEAH.
Stephen: ARE YOU ENDING THE SHOW BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID TO SHOW '70s FASHIONS? (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU TOO MUCH OF A COWARD TO SHOW FRINGE AND LEISURE SUITS?
IT GETS PRETTY BAD PRETTY SOON, I HAVE TO SAY, HAVING GROWN UP IN THAT PERIOD, MY DAD HAD A GIANT RED MUSTACHE HE USED TO WEAR BOWLING SHOES AND A MAROON BLAZER. THAT'S MY DAD. MY MOM'S STUFF WAS MORE INSANE.
Stephen: WHAT COLOR WAS YOUR MOTHER'S BEARD?
MY MOTHER HAD A LIGHTLY BLEACHED MUSTACHE.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. THAT'S A VERY SWEET MEMORY FOR A  SON TO HAVE. BUT OUR VISION OF THE 1960S, IT'S KIND OF A BEAUTIFIC VIEW. WE EVEN HAVE SAINTED FIGURES THROUGHOUT THE 1960s WITH BOTH KENNEDYS AND KING. BUT THIS VISION WE'RE GETTING OF INDIVIDUALS' LIVES IS NOT NECESSARILY A HAPPY ONE. DON'T YOU HAVE ANY HAPPY MEMORIES OF THE 1960s? I WAS BORN IN 1964 AND 1969 WAS SO HAPPY TO ME. I WAS ALWAYS WITH MY MOM AND LISTENING TO "THE ASSOCIATION" ON THE RADIO. (LAUGHTER)
I WAS BORN IN '65 AND I  REMEMBER LISTENING TO SPANKY AND OUR GANG AND MY DAD LISTENED TO JUDY COLLINS. NO, BUT I HAD A HAPPY MEMORY. THERE IS A POSITIVE ELEMENT TO IT WHICH IS LIKE YOU RECOGNIZE PARTS OF YOUR LIFE. BUT I REALLY WANTED TO TELL THE STORY THAT OUR VIEW OF THE '60s HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN BY A CERTAIN GENERATION THAT WAS EVEN A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAN YOU AND I ARE. AND THEY HAVE A VERY ROSY PICTURE --
Stephen: THE BABY BOOMERS. YES.
Stephen: THEY WON'T LET US STOP THINKING ABOUT THE 60s.
THEY THINK THEY INVENTED SEX, DRUGS, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: YEP. THEY HAVE A VIEW OF IT THAT IS A CHILD'S VIEW OF IT. SO I WANTED TO SAY WHAT WOULD IT BE IF YOU WERE AN ADULT WHO LIVE THROUGH FAIRLY INTERESTING THINGS LIKE WORLD WAR II AND THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THEN THIS COMES ALONG. AND THERE WAS TREMENDOUS CHANGE AND THE CLICHE TURBULENCE AND FREE LOVE. BUT THERE WAS FREE LOVE IN THE 1920s AND THE 1930s, THE BEATNICK MOVEMENT OF THE 1950s. NO ONE INVENTED ANY OF THIS. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WAS THERE WAS A GENERATION THAT WAS ASKED BUT THEY GOT EDUCATION, A LOT OF ENTERTAINMENT, THEY GOT SPENDING MONEY, THEY BECAME THE FOCUS OF THE ECONOMY, OF  EVERYTHING, THERE WAS A WAR GOING ON WHICH THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT AND SOME DIDN'T, BUT IN THE GENERATION BEFORE THEM ALL OF THEM FOUGHT, AND THEY HAVE A VERY SORT OF DEMANDING -- I EXPERIENCE IT IN REAL LIFE. THEY'LL COME UP AND SAY WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS OR THAT? AND I'M, LIKE, I'M NOT TELLING YOUR STORY. I'M TELLING THE STORY OF YOUR PARENTS OR YOUR GRANDPARENTS. SO I DON'T HAVE A JUDGMENT ON IT, NECESSARILY -- THAT SOUNDED REALLY JUDGMENTAL, IT DID -- (LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: LOOK IN THE MIRROR, MATTHEW.
YEAH, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN ENDING FOR THE SERIES, YOU WORKED ON "THE SOPRANOS," OKAY.
YES.
Stephen: A GREAT ENDING TO THIS SERIES "MAD MEN" WOULD BE IF, IN THE LAST EPISODE, DON TURNED TO THE CAMERA AND EXPLAINED THE ENDING OF "THE SOPRANOS." (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, IT'S A PLEASURE!
Stephen:  MATT WEINER, "MAD MEN" FINAL EPISODE, MAY 25TH  FOR THIS  SEASON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
