Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  "REPORT"! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN! FOLKS --  (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, WITH AN ARMY LIKE YOU BEHIND ME, I THINK WE CAN STORM  THE MORANIN. FOLKS, IT IS NIGHT TWO OF HOW  ABOUT WEEK OR AS THEY SAY IN THE  BLACK TONG OF MORDOR, TUESDAY. (LAUGHTER)  I'M JUST ENJOYING SOME OF THE  PIPE WEED THAT SIR IAN McKELLAN  LEFT IN HIS DRESSING ROOM. (LAUGHTER)  PRETTY GOOD. NOT AS GOOD AS THE STUFF THAT  WILLIE NELSON LEAVES BEHIND. (LAUGHTER)  STILL, WIZARDY WEED IS GOOD FOR  ONE THING. CHECK THIS OUT. NOT BAD, EH. SAVE THAT FOR LATER. LAST NIGHT, GANDALF THE GRAY  ASKED ME TO JOIN HIM ON THE  ADVENTURE AND TONIGHT IT IS THE LEAD CHARACTER OF BILBO GAG  AGAINS. MARTIN FREEMAN. HOW EXCITING, HIS FATHER MORGAN  MUST BE SO PROUD. (LAUGHTER)  MORE ON MARTIN LATER BUT NOW,  FOLKS, I ALWAYS GO FROM THE GUT  BECAUSE MY GUT IS THE LARGEST SINGLE ORGAN IN MY BODY NEXT TO  MY BALLS. (LAUGHTER)  SORRY, PROSTATE, MAYBE NEXT  EXAM. (LAUGHTER)  BUT NOW SCIENTISTS SAY THAT THE  OLDER YOU GET THE LESS YOU CAN  TRUST YOUR GUT.
WE ALL HAVE A NATURAL  SUSPICION IN OUR BRAINS, RIGHT? IT WARNS US WHEN SOMEBODY'S NOT  TRUSTWORTHY OR TRYING TO RIP US  OFF. YOU CAN FEEL IT. BUT RESEARCHERS SAY WE GET LESS  SKEPTICAL AS WE GET OLDER. HERE'S THE BAD NEWS: IT STARTS  IN YOUR MID-50s. AS WE GET OLDER WE LOSE THE  ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHO OR WHAT  IS UNTRUSTWORTHY. SHELLEY TAYLOR, THE LEAD  RESEARCHER SAYS PEOPLE BASICALLY  AS THEY AGE LOSE THAT GUT FEELING THAT, HEY, SOMETHING'S  WRONG HERE.
Stephen: WHO WHO'D HAVE  THOUGHT THAT ELDERLY FOX NEWS  VIEWERS WOULD BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MISINFORMATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW, FOLKS, MY 50s ARE YEARS AND  TWO YEARS AWAY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT I WANT TO PROTECT MYSELF  AGAINST BECOMING GULLIBLE. FORTUNATELY A MAN ON T.V. IS  SELLING ME A MIRACLE CURE THAT  WILL KEEP ME YOUNG FOREVER! IT'S CALLED "ANDRO GEL AND IT'S  FOR TREATING SOMETHING CALLED  LOW "T," A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY RECOGNIZING MILLIONS OF  MEN WITH LOW TESTOSTERONE  PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS GETTING  OLDER. (LAUGHTER)  THIS TESTOSTERONE SUPPLEMENT WAS  ORIGINALLY AVAILABLE IN THE NEAR  1% CONCENTRATION, OR AS I CALL IT, MAN MILK SKIM. (LAUGHTER)  BUT LAST NIGHT WHEN I WAS  WATCHING CNN'S PRIME TIME LINEUP  OF ADS FOR ENSURE AND SELF-LUBRICATING CATHETERS --  (LAUGHTER)  BY THE WAY, GREAT WAY TO DELIVER  ENSURE RIGHT TO THE NEEDED  AREAS. (LAUGHTER)  I HEARD THE GREAT NEWS.
PRESENTING ANDROGEL 1.62%. IT RAISES YOUR TESTOSTERONE  LEVELS AND IT'S CONCENTRATED SO  YOU CAN USE LESS GEL.
Stephen: WHAT AN INCREDIBLE  BREAK THROUGH! I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS OR  WHAT IT DOES BUT NOW I CAN USE  LESS OF IT! (LAUGHTER)  THE BEST PART IS THIS HIGHLY  CONCENTRATED MALE SEX HORMONE  DOESN'T HAVE ONE SIDE EFFECT IT HAS DOZENS OF THEM.
SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE  WORSENING OF ENLARGED PROSTATE,  INCREASED RISK OF PROSTATE CANCER, LOWER SPERM COUNT,  SWELLING OF ANKLES, FEET, OR  BODY.
Stephen: SO, FELLAS, KEEP AN  EYE OUT FOR ANY SWELLING HERE,  HERE, OR HERE. (LAUGHTER)  AND THAT IS NOT ALL THAT IT IS  DOING FOR YOU.
MEN WITH BREAST CANCER OR WHO  HAVE OR MIGHT HAVE PROSTATE  CANCER AND WOMEN WHO ARE AND MAY BECOME PREGNANT OR ARE  BREAST-FEEDING SHOULD NOT USE  IT.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE FINE AS  LONG AS YOU DON'T HAVE CANCER,  WILL NEVER GET CANCER, ARE NOT PREGNANT, MIGHT BECOME PREGNANT,  OR CAME INTO THIS WORLD VIA  PREGNANCY. (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, NEVER DOUBT ANDROGEL'S  POTENCY, BECAUSE THE SIDE  EFFECTS AREN'T JUST FOR YOU, THEY'RE FOR ANYONE NEAR YOU!
DISCONTINUE ANDROJELL AND  CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU SEE  UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF EARLY PUBER ANY A CHILD OR SIGNS IN WOMAN  WHICH MAY INCLUDE CHANGES IN  BODY HAIR.
Stephen: NOW THAT SOUNDS  SCARY. THAT SOUNDS SCARY BUT IF YOUR  SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL GETS TOO CLOSE  TO THE ANDROGEL, DON'T WORRY, YOU HAVEN'T LOST A DAUGHTER,  YOU'VE GAINED A COUSIN IT. (LAUGHTER)  NOW BECAUSE IT'S SO POWERFUL,  THE MAKERS OF ANDROGEL HAVE  PRODUCED A VIDEO TO SHOW YOU HOW TO SAFELY CONTAIN THE HORMONE  CHERNOBYL THAT WILL BE YOUR  BATHROOM.
THIS IS DAVE, HE HAS  HYPOGONADISM.
Stephen: AND THAT IS ONE OF  THE LEAST POPULAR FORMS OF  GONADISM. (LAUGHTER)  OKAY, GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT  THAT. SO WHAT DO YOU DO, DAVE?
I APPLY IT EARLY IN THE MORN  WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE IS STILL  SLEEPING.
Stephen: EVIDENTLY YOU SHOULD  APPLY IT WHEN YOUR FAMILY IS  UNCONSCIOUS. YOU CAN'T GET THEM IN THEIR  DREAMS BUT LET ME ASK YOU, DAVE,  WHAT IF I SPILL SOME?
IF ANY EXCESS GEL COMES OUT  WHEN I'M PRIMING I WASH IT AWAY  DOWN THE SINK TO AVOID ACCIDENTAL EXPOSURE TO OTHERS.
I'LL AVOID EXPOSING IT TO  OTHERS BY LETTING IT FLOW INTO  MY TOWN'S WATER SUPPLY. (LAUGHTER)  AND WE'RE DONE.
ONCE YOU FINISH APPLYING IT,  I RINSE DOWN THE BOTTLE AND WASH  MY HANDS WITH SOAP AND WATER. ALWAYS BE SURE TO RINSE OFF THE  SINK HANDLES.
Stephen: OKAY, SO I'LL WATCH  THE ANDROGEL, THEN WASH MYSELF,  THEN WASH EVERYTHING THAT WASHED EVERYTHING ELSE. (LAUGHTER)  OR -- YOU KNOW WHAT? IT MIGHT BE SIMPLER TO KEEP A  BUCKET OF FRENCH SINK HANDLES  AROUND. (LAUGHTER)  BUT FOLKS, SAY IT'S A SMALL  PRICE TO PAY BECAUSE NOW WITH  THE ANDROGEL, I'M ALL JACKED AND HAVE THE SEX DRIVE OF A  25-YEAR-OLD AND I'M READY TO  THRILL MY WIFE.
IF A WOMAN OR CHILD COMES  INTO CONTACT WITH THE  APPLICATION AREA, THAT AREA ON THE WOMAN OR CHILD SHOULD BE  WASHED WELL WITH SOAP AND WATER  RIGHT AWAY.
Stephen: OKAY, NO CONTACT  WITH WOMEN. NO BIG DEAL, AS LONG AS YOU'RE  CAREFUL ANDROGEL CAN STILL BE  JUST THE THING YOU AND YOUR LADY NEED TO REKINDLE THAT OLD FIRE  IN THE BEDROOM. (LAUGHTER)  BUT IT'S FOREPLAY. FOREPLAY. THE POINT IS THIS MASS MARKETED  EASILY SPREAD ENDO CIN TOXIN IS  NOW AVAILABLE IN 1.6 20%. YOUR BALLS WILL THANK YOU FOR  IT. SERIOUSLY. THEY MAY GAIN THE POWER OF  SPEECH. (LAUGHTER)  BUT MEN AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO  NEED HELP IN THE HORMONE ZONE  BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION  11% TO 41% OF WOMEN SUFFER FROM  A CONDITION KNOWN AS FEMALE ORGASMIC DISORDER. YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT. 11% TO 41%. (LAUGHTER)  SO THIS IS EITHER VERY RARE OR  COMPLETELY NORMAL. (LAUGHTER)  THE POINT IS, WHERE I AM DOING  SEX WRONG. NOW, THIS ORGASMIC DISORDER IS  WHAT I CALL LOW "O" TRADEMARKED. AND, FOLKS, THIS MAY COME AS A  SHOCK. BUT BIG PHARMA HAS A PROFITABLE  ANSWER FOR THAT, TOO.
WOMEN WHO HAVE TROUBLE  REACHING ORGASM DURING SEX COULD  SOON GET HELP, BELIEVE IT OR NOT FROM A NASAL SPRAY.
THEY MIGHT ALSO GET HELP FROM  THAT GUY'S MUSTACHE. (LAUGHTER)  SO WHAT IS THIS MIRACLE PRODUCT?
IT'S CALLED TESINA.
WOMEN WOULD SPRAY TWO PUMPS  IN EACH NOSTRIL ABOUT TWO HOURS  BEFORE SEX. IT'S EXPECTED TO WORK FOR UP TO  SIX HOURS.
Stephen: YES, IT'S GOOD FOR  UP TO SIX HOURS, ALTHOUGH MEN  ARE NOT. (LAUGHTER)  SO BASICALLY IF A FEW MINUTES OF  INTIMACY FOLLOWED BY FIVE AND A  HALF HOURS OF HIGHLY EROTIC  SCRAPBOOKING. (LAUGHTER)  SO JUST WHAT'S IN THERE THAT'S  SO GOOD FOR WOMEN?
IT'S A NASAL GEL THAT  DELIVERS A DOSE OF TESTOSTERONE  DIRECTLY TO THE BRAIN.
Stephen: IT'S TESTOSTERONE! SO IT'S JUST ANDROGEL YOU SHOOT  STRAIGHT INTO YOUR BRAIN! SO, LADIES, DON'T BE SURPRISED  IF YOUR PRE-FRONTAL LOBE SPROUTS  A HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE. (LAUGHTER)  SO GET TEFINA, LADIES. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD A  PRESCRIPTION, JUST TELL YOUR  HUSBAND NOT THE RINSE OUT THE  SINK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
