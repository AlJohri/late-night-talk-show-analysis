Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE C.E.O. OF BECAUSE FEED. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE REASON WHY HE'S ON THE GREATEST SHOW EVER. PLEASE WELCOME JONAH PERETTI. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, HEY, JONAH, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. MERRY CHRISTMAS.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: MERRY CHRISTMAS. HOW ARE YOU? MERRY CHRISTMAS, MY FRIEND.
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU, HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT WAS AGONIZING.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. FOUNDER AND C.E.O. OF BUZZFEED. ONE OF THE COFOUNDERS OF HUFFINGTON POST IN 2005. WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS THE FUTURE OF NEWS AGREE OR DISAGREE?
WE'RE A NEWS AND ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY. WE'RE INVESTING HEAVILY IN NEWS. WE JUST DID OUR FIRST REPORTING FROM SYRIA WE HAVE PEOPLE IN KIEV COVERING THE PROTEST THERE AND WE ARE STARTING AN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM TEAM BY PULITZER PRIZE WINNING JOURNALISTS THAT START IN JANUARY. WE'RE BUILDING UP.
Stephen: OKAY, BUT WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? WHY WOULD YOU POLLUTE YOUR BRAND WITH JOURNALISM? (LAUGHTER) YOU DON'T SEE DANCING WITH THE STARS CUTTING OUT OF THEIR SHOW TO REPORT ON CHICAGO GUN VIOLENCE. YOU'VE GOTTEN A INCREDIBLY EASY-TO-DIGEST SITE. PEOPLE CALL YOUR SITE FULL OF CLICK BAIT. IS THAT AN INSULT TO YOU? I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE IT AS BADGE OF HONOR.
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY CLICK, WE CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY SHARE. THE BEST VIRAL MARKETING STRATEGY IS UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN HEAD AND HEART. IF YOU MAKE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS YOU'LL HAVE SUCCESS.
Stephen: HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT ATROCITIES IN SYRIA AND HOW OFTEN DO THEY WANT TO SEE THE 15 SEXIEST PANDAS? (LAUGHTER)
IT DEPENDS HOW SEXY THE PANDAS ARE.
Stephen: OR SEXY OTTERS OR WHATEVER IT IS.
OR HOW BAD THE ATROCITIES ARE, ALSO.
Stephen: OKAY. SEXY ATROCITIES. OR SEXY PANDAS ACTING OUT SYRIAN ATROCITIES. I JUST GOT YOUR NEXT CLICK BAIT, MY FRIEND. FRIEND.
YOUR TALENTS ARE WASTED HERE. YOU SHOULD START POSTING FOR US.
Stephen: SO MANY PEOPLE ARE COPYING YOU NOW. IS IT GOING TO BE ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE "NEW YORK TIMES" IS BUZZFEEDING THEIR OWN SITE?
PEOPLE HAVE TO FOLLOW THEIR OWN PATH.
Stephen: THEIR BATH IS RIGHT INTO BANKRUPTCY. WHAT IS -- THEY'RE FIRING PEOPLE. YOU'RE HIRING PEOPLE. WHAT PATH WOULD YOU RECOMMEND PEOPLE TAKE?
IT'S HARD TO COPY SOMEONE ELSE.
Stephen: NO, IT'S VERY, VERY, VERY EASY. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT'S NOT ONLY A SINCERE FORM OF FLATTERY BUT AN EXCELLENT WAY TO MAKE MONEY. SEE, LIKE NETWORK TELEVISION. THEY JUST COPY EACH OTHER.
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED WHAT WE'RE DOING. YOU HAVE TECHNOLOGY, YOU HAVE THE CULTURE OF THE COMPANY.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE CULTURE OF BUZZFEED? FIVE WORDS OR LESS? WHAT'S YOUR CULTURE?
PLAYFUL, EXPERIMENTAL, IT'S LEARNING FROM DATA, BUT IT'S ALSO BUILDING INTUITION.
Stephen: THAT'S 10. LEARNING FROM DATA, BUILDING INTUITION GETS YOU UP TO 10. (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU A JOURNALIST?
I DIDN'T COME FROM A JOURNALISM BACKGROUND, I CAME FROM A TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND. THAT IS WHY I HIRED BEN SMITH AS OUR EDITOR-IN-CHIEF TO LEAD OUR JOURNALISM.
Stephen: BEN SMITH USED TO BE AT POLITICO.
HE DID, YES.
Stephen: WHY LEAVE POLITICO TO COME WORK FOR YOU GUYS? IS IT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO WORK FOR A SITE THAT HAD LESS GOSSIP? (LAUGHTER)
HE WANTED TO BUILD SOMETHING NEW. HE WAS ONE OF THE -- HE WAS PART OF THE TEAM THAT REALLY BUILT POLITICO AND I THINK HE WAS EXCITED ABOUT -- HE SAW THE WAY THE WEB WAS SHIFTING TOWARDS SOCIAL AND HE WANTED TO BUILD SOMETHING NEW AND DIFFERENT AND WE ALL BELIEVE WE CAN BUILD A BIG MEDIA COMPANY THAT -- FOR THE WAY PEOPLE CONSUME MEDIA TODAY-- MOBILE AND SOCIAL BEING THE DOMINANT THINGS PEOPLE USE TO CONSUME THEIR MEDIA.
Stephen: WHAT'S A LISTICLE? THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LIST OF THE TOP TWO TESTICLES IN MY SCROTUM. WHAT IS A LISTICLE?
WE'LL HAVE THAT ON THE SITE TOMORROW, I'M SURE. THE -- A LISTICLE IS JUST A LIST. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS WERE A LIST.
Stephen: REALLY. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IS A LISTICLE?
THE BILL OF RIGHTS.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENT BETWEEN A LISTICLE AND A LIST THEN.
LIST IS A BETTER WORD. WE DIDN'T SAY LISTICLE, OTHER PEOPLE SAID THAT.
Stephen: YOU GO WITH THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? EVERYONE SAYS IT.
Stephen: STAND YOUR GROUND. (LAUGHTER) 50 YEARS FROM NOW IS EVERYTHING GOING TO BE BUZZFEED? ARE WE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT -- ARE PEOPLE GOING TO REFER TO BUZZFEED AS THE -- YOU KNOW, THE OLD GRAY LADY? THE LISTICLE OF RECORD? (LAUGHTER)
IT'S A VERY DYNAMIC TIME IN THE MEDIA INDUSTRY. SO MANY THINGS ARE CHANGING SO RAPIDLY RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: BY "DYNAMIC" YOU MEAN CLUSTER (BLEEP), RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) PEOPLE JUST -- MEDIA JUST BEING THROWN ON THE DEATH WAGON AS IT RATTLES THROUGH TOWN?
IT'S A CHALLENGING TIME FOR PRINT MEDIA AND THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITING NEW COMPANIES FORMING AND IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT WILL HAPPEN TEN YEARS, 50 YEARS OUT, BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUALLY CHANGE WHAT WE DO.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO GET ANY OF THOSE GOOGLE ROBOTS?
THEY CAN DELIVER THE NEWSPAPER, I GUESS.
Stephen: THEY COULD GO GET THE NEWS. YOU COULD -- YOU COULD GET ROBOTS TO FORCE PEOPLE TO DO THINGS THAT ARE NEWSWORTHY. (LAUGHTER) HMM?
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. YEAH.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: JONAH PERETTI. BUZZFEED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GO CLICK ON IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
