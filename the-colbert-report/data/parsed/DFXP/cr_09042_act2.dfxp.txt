Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. NATION, I BELIEVE SEVEN ENTITLED  TO MY OWN OPINION. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF  THE FINGER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE TIP AND HAT PEOPLE ARE IN  THE HOUSE. YOU KNOW ME BOOM. YOU KNOW ME, I'M A GADGET GUY. SOIFS DISAPPOINTED TO LEARN  ABOUT A NEW INVENTION THAT SET  OUR CULTURE BACK.
THIS IS THE HAPIFORK. BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS FORK  MEASURE HOW'S QUICKLY YOU ARE  EATING. FIT FINDS THAWR EATING TOO  QUICKLY IT'S GOING VIBRATE IN  EUROPE HAND AND FORCE YOU TO SLOW DOWN.
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL  AMERICANS HAVE SOMETHING THAT  MAKE YOURS HAND TREMBLE SO WE STOP EATING. IT'S CALLED A STROKE. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF  MY FINGER TO HAPIFORK. THIS CAN COMES FROM HONG KONG  WHERE THEY HAVE A CENTURY'S OLD  TRADITION OF TABLEWEAR THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM EATING. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH ONE IS THE SPOON? [ LAUGHTER ] I SAY IF WE'RE IMPROVING OUR  UTENSILS, IT'S TIME TO MOVE  BEYOND THE HAPIFORK TO MY PATENTED NEW "SELF-LOATHING FOOD  SLUICE." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A COMBINATION FUNNEL AND  HIGH CAPACITY GRINDER THAT  DELIVERS A CONSTANT STREAM OF NUTRIENT INTO YOUR GORGE. [ LAUGHTER ] STEPHEN COLBERT'S SELF-LOATHING  FOOD SLUICE IS AVAILABLE IN  SMALL, MEDIUM, AND "I HATE MYSELF." [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT UP ON TIP HAT WAG FING, I  LOVES ME MY B-BALL. IT'S FAST PACED, TOUGH, AND  AGGRESSIVE. AND THAT'S JUST WHEN PLAYERS ARE  PUNCHING THE FANS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NOW THERE'S AN EVEN BETTER  REASON TO ENJOY THE GAME.
WHAT WAS UP WITH KEVIN  GARNETT AND CARMELO ANTHONY LAST  NIGHT? ALL NIGHT LONG, CHIPPING,  PUSHING AND SHOVING IN THE  CELTICS' WIN OVER THE KNICKS. MELO EVEN WAITED OUTSIDE FOR THE  CELTICS BY THEIR TEAM BUS TO  HAVE FURTHER WORDS WITH KEVIN GARNETT AFTER THE GAME. IT'S BLOWING UP ALL OVER THE  PLACE. WHY WAS HE SO UPSET? REPORTEDLY GARNETT TOLD CARMELO  ANTHONY HIS WIFE TASTED LIKE  HONEY NUT CHEERIOS. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Stephen: OH SNAP, KRACKLE,  AND POP! [ LAUGHTER ] CARMELO, YOU JUST GOT  APPLE-JACKED! KEVIN'S SAYING HE HAD YOUR WIFE  REALITY STAR LA LA VAZQUEZ, AS A  PART OF THIS COMPLETE BREAKFAST! [ LAUGHTER ] THIS BRINGS ME TO A TIP OF MY  HAT TO KEVIN GARNETT, FOR  FORGING A BOLD NEW PATH IN PRODUCT PLACEMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS ISN'T JUST TRASH TALK, IT'S  HEFTY BRAND TRASH TALK. [ LAUGHTER ] FORGET GYM SHOES AND SPRITE,  FROM NOW ON, ALL NBA GAMES  SHOULD BE FILLED WITH ATHLETES INCORPORATING NATIONAL BRANDS  INTO THEIR TAUNTING. "YO MAMA'S SO FAT SHE SHOULD  SWITCH TO CHOBANI NON-FAT GREEK  YOGURT, NOW WITH ACTIVE PROBIOTICS." [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OR "I'M GONNA CUT THROUGH YOUR D  LIKE THE FELLOWES POWERSHRED  84Ci. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'LL BE SCRAPING YOUR RAGGEDY  1-1/2 INCH CROSS-CUT PARTICLES  OUT OF THE SIX-GALLON PULLOUT  BIN. AND YOU WON'T BE SCORING ON THE  RETURN EITHER, BECAUSE LIKE THE  84Ci, I'M 100% JAM PROOF-- BEE-OTCH!" [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT KEVIN, AS MUCH AS I ADMIRE  YOUR BUSINESS ACUMEN, IT'S HIS  WIFE. LAY OFF THE DEROGATORY COMMENTS  THAT COULD BE MISINTERPRETED AS  SEXUAL. JUST SAY SOMETHING COMPLIMENTARY  LIKE "SHE'S GRRRRRRRR-EAAT!" [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUS
