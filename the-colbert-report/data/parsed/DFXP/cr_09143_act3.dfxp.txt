(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. NOW, LET'S TURN TO GARY WITH THE  WEATHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HEY, WELCOME. THANKS FOR COMING ON!
YOU BET.
Stephen: NOW, FOR THOSE FEW  MEMBERS OF MY VIEWING AUDIENCE  OUT THERE WHO ARE NOT FROM THE OKLAHOMA AREA, LET ME EXPLAIN  THAT YOU ARE GARY ENGLAND, THE  CHIEF METEOROLOGIST AT KW T.V., OKLAHOMA'S NEWS LEADER.
CORRECT.
Stephen: OKLAHOMA'S OWN  NEWS 9, OKLAHOMA CITY. YOU WERE THE TOP-RATED  METEOROLOGIST IN OKLAHOMA FOR 40  YEARS. TORNADO ALLEY. IF THERE WAS A TORNADO COMING  YOU TIER GUY THAT PEOPLE TALK  TO. IN FACT, YOU APPEARED IN THE  MOVIE "TWISTER" AS A TORNADO  EXPERT. (LAUGHTER)
TRUE. TRUE STORY. IT WAS QUITE FASCINATING. THEY NEVER CALLED BACK. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: HOW DO YOU BECOME  A FAMOUS -- CAN I SAY WEATHERMAN  OR IS THAT AN INSULT TO  METEOROLOGISTS?
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL ME.
Stephen: A CLOUD JOCKEY! (LAUGHTER)  HOW DO YOU BECOME A SUPERSTAR  ROCK STAR IN METEOROLOGY?
LONG HOURS, A LOT OF DAYS, A  LOT OF TORNADOES, PEOPLE BUILD  CONFIDENCE IN YOU. THEY TRUST YOU, YOU BECOME A  PART OF THEIR FAMILY BECAUSE  YOU'RE ON WITH THEM ALL THE TIME DURING A SEVERE WEATHER AND IF  YOU WERE A CHILD AT HOME I WOULD  SAY TO YOU "CHILDREN THAT ARE HOME ALONE, THIS IS WHAT I WANT  YOU DO. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CELLOR OR  BASEMENT GO TO THE CENTER PART  OF YOUR HOUSE, CLOSET OR BATHROOM, WRAP UP WITH BLANKETS,  GET IN THE TUB, COVER UP IN CASE  THE TORNADO GOES BY."
Stephen: THAT'S IN CASE OF  A TORNADO.
YES.
Stephen: BUT OTHERWISE THE  CHILDREN SHOULD NOT LISTEN TO  THE MAN ON THE T.V. (LAUGHTER)
THAT IS CORRECT!
Stephen: LET'S PUT UP A  WEATHER MAP, JIM. THERE YOU GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THIS IS THE WEATHER TODAY IN THE  UNITED STATES. CAN YOU --S WHERE -- WHERE OVER  HERE IS TORNADO ALLEY.
WELL, THE PRIME TORNADO ALLEY  IS NORTH TEXAS INTO OKLAHOMA AND  SOUTHERN KANSAS BUT IT DOES MIGRATE AROUND THE COUNTRY OVER  A PERIOD OF YEARS, TEN YEARS. IN A FEW YEARS IT MIGHT MAINLY  BE EASTERN CANADA, ILLINOIS, IT  WILL ROTATE TO THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. SO WHERE THE MOST TORNADOES  OCCUR MIGRATES.
Stephen: IT'S NOT AN ALLEY,  THAT'S A WORM. (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT. SO IT'S THIS, THIS, THIS AREA.
GENERALLY. YOU GOT I, BABY.
Stephen: THIS IS WHERE  WE'RE IN TKAEUPBG IT IS WHAT  YOU'RE SAYING. OKLAHOMA HAS HAD DEVASTATING  TORNADOES RECENTLY. HOW BIG -- WHAT IS THE BIGGEST  TORNADO THAT OKLAHOMA'S EVER  FACED?
WELL, THE LARGEST TORNADO  THAT OKLAHOMA FACED OR ANY STATE  HAS FACED OCCURRED ON MAY 31 THIS YEAR. IT WAS 2.6 MILES WIDE. THINK ABOUT THAT. 2.6 MILES WIDE. THE WINDS IN THE VICINITY OF 300  MILES PER HOUR. IT WAS THE WIDEST, THE LARGEST  AND THE WINDS WERE CLOSEST TO  THE STRONGEST WE'VE EVER SEEN.
Stephen: WHY -- DO PEOPLE  LIVE IN OKLAHOMA? (LAUGHTER)  NO OFFENSE. BUT 300 MILES AN HOUR WINDS?
WELL, THAT'S JUST  OCCASIONALLY. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND  THERE'S A GESTURE YOU WOULD DO  WHEN THINGS WERE GOING TO BE  BAD. PEOPLE KNEW THERE WAS GOING TO  BE A BAD STORM IF WHAT HAPPENED?
I TAKE MY COAT OFF SOMETIMES  THESE WEATHER EVENTS WE'RE ON  FOR SIX HOURS, I'VE BEEN ON AS LONG AS TEN HOURS. YOU DON'T GO TO THE BATHROOM,  JUST DO YOUR JOB. AT SOME POINT YOU TAKE THE COAT  OFF.
Stephen: AND PEOPLE CALL A  PRIEST.
(LAUGHS)  THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA IN SOME  CASE BUS THE WARNINGS ARE GOOD  NOW DAYS AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT A BIG TORNADO LIKE WE'VE  HAD RECENTLY IN OKLAHOMA AND  OTHER STATES, WE KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE AND WHAT IT'S GOING  TO DO.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU  SOMETHING: ON THE MAP, WHY IS  THE SUN WEARING SUNGLASSES? (LAUGHTER)  THE EARTH SHOULD WEAR THE  SUNGLASSES.
WELL, THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE AN OVEN  WEARING OVEN MITTS. (LAUGHTER)  IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. HOW DID YOU BECOME A FAMOUS  WEATHER MAN WITHOUT A WEATHERMAN  NAME. YOUR NAME IS GARY ENGLAND. SHOULDN'T IT BE SOMETHING LIKE  "SLEEP THINGERSLUSH?"
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. A LOT OF PEOPLE DO CHANGE THEIR  NAMES.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER  THOUGHT ABOUT IT?
NO, NO.
Stephen: THINK ABOUT IT. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR NAME TO  BE. IF YOU COULD PICK A WEATHER  NAME? WHAT ARE YOUR TWO FAVORITE  WEATHER PATTERNS?
I LO DO LOVE THE WIND AND I  DO LOVE THE RAIN.
Stephen: WINY RAIN. SOUNDS.
WINDY RAIN.
Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE A  STRIPPER. (LAUGHTER)  THANK YOU SO MUCH, METEOROLOGIST  GARY ENGLAND PROFILED IN
