Stephen:  WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. I'M HERE WITH MY, I'M HERE WITH MY OLD FRIEND AND NEMESIS, ONE OLD PIECE OF HUMANITY, MR. JON STEWART. NOW JON YOU'VE GOT A NEW MOVIE, IT'S CALLED ROSEWATER, OKAY.
YES.
Stephen:  I'VE SEEN THE FILM AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FILM AND THAT OFFENDS ME. WHY IS IT THAT YOU CAN DO YOUR SHOW, AND I MAY NOT AGREE WITH YOUR SHOW BUT I THINK YOU DO IT WELL AND YET YOU ALSO ARE NOW DOING SOMETHING ELSE WELL. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO STAY IN YOUR LANE, RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO STAY IN YOUR GESTATION CRATE, ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MOVE OUT OF YOUR CRATE. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?
THAT'S FOR MY OWN SAFETY BY THE WAY.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT. LAST SUMMER YOU BUGGED OUT. YOU GREW A BEARD AND WENT TO JORDAN.
I DIDN'T EVEN GROW A BEARD, THEY GAVE IT TO ME LIKE A LEI THEY JUST GIVE IT TO YOU.
Stephen:  THAT'S FANTASTIC.
A GENTLEMAN GREETED ME, HE PUT THIS ON AND SAID YOU ARE FREE TO PART WHATEVER WATERS YOU WANT. NOW THIS IS THE STORY OF A MAN NAMED MAZIAR BAHARI
YES AN IRANIAN JOURNALIST. LIVES IN LONDON, WENT TO IRAN THEY ARRESTED HIM, STEPHEN. IN 2009.  THIS IS A STORY ABOUT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. AND YET ALSO HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC
Stephen:  WE HAVE A CLIP ACTUALLY. LET ME SET THE CLIP UP IF I CAN.
Stephen: SURE.
ALRIGHT, HERE'S THE CLIP.  [CROWD CHEERING]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING.
FIGHTING BACK.
YOU GOING TO GET KILLED
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? THEY TOOK MY BOAT.
IT'S NOT RIGHT!
WHO ARE YOU TO SAY? YOU HAVE A REAL WEAPON AND YOU REFUSE TO USE IT
SO THAT FOOTAGE THAT YOU SAW USE IT
SO THAT FOOTAGE THAT YOU SAW IS ACTUAL FOOTAGE DURING THE 2009, THAT ACTUAL AND AS IT ROLLS A GENTLEMAN GETS KILLED ON THE RAMPARTS. IT'S THE REAL FOOTAGE AND HE WAS ARRESTED HAVING THAT FOOTAGE UP LOADED TO THE BBC AND BROADCAST.
THIS IS THE REASON THEY ARRESTED HIM FOR UPLOADING THAT FOOTAGE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY CITED HIM GOING ON THE DAILY SHOW BEING INTERVIEWED.
WHEN HE WAS BEING INTERROGATED THEY PLAYED FOR HIM A CLIP. THEY HAD DONE AN INTERVIEW WITH JASON. IT'S SOMETHING YOU REMEMBER FROM DOING THOSE ARE. INTERVIEWING HIM HE SAID I'M AN AMERICAN SPY. AS A SPY I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW CAN YOU TELL ME WHY IRAN'S SO TERRIFYING. AND HE GOES THROUGH ALL THE REASONS SAYING WHY AMERICA AND IRAN ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT. THEY PLAYED THAT FOR HIM IN PRISON AND SAID TO HIM WHY IS AN AMERICAN SPY TALKING TO YOU IF YOU'RE NOT A SPY. AND MAZIAR SAID WHY DOES AN AMERICAN SPY HAVE A TELEVISION SHOW. AND I BELIEVE IT WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE. [LAUGHTER]
IS THAT NOT AN EVIL THING FOR IRAN TO HAVE DONE?
THE EVIL IS RELATIVELY RARE. IGNORANCE IS EPIDEMIC. I WOULD QUALIFIER THAT AS IGNORANT, YET NOT NECESSARILY EVIL. AND WITHIN THE FILM WE SHOW A BROAD SWATH OF IRANIAN SOCIETY TO SHOW HOW COMPLEX AND NUANCED AND TEXTURED IT ACTUALLY IS. IRAN IS NOT NOW, I KNOW YOU'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS BEFORE THAT YOU VERY MUCH WANT AMERICA TO BE THE ONLY COUNTRY. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU ...
Stephen:  THERE IS AMERICA AND THEN THERE ARE COUNTRIES.
I UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S AN ADMIRABLE PLAN. BUT RATHER THAN, AND AGAIN WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO SIT DOWN AND HASH THIS OUT. RATHER THAN KILLING EVERYBODY ELSE, WHAT IF WE WERE TO COEXIST WITH THEM IN SOME TYPE OF FASHION.
COEXIST LIKE THAT BUMPER STICKER THAT PEOPLE HAVE.
NOT IN A KUMBAYA BUT NOT NECESSARILY BENDING THEM TO OUR WILL.
BUT THEY WILL DO WHAT WE SAY. [LAUGHTER]
ARE THERE BETTER WAYS OF DOING THINGS THAN WE DO THINGS. OR ARE YOU A BLAME AMERICA FIRST. LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
WHAT IS IT, STEPHEN? DO YOU THINK, ARE PEOPLE IN IRAN- [LAUGHTER]
STEPHEN HOW MANY OF THESE HAVE YOU DONE.
THIS IS MY 3,000TH INTERVIEW FOR ROSEWATER!
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE ON MY SHOW BEFORE THE SHOW IS OVER. THIS IS SO LOVELY [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JON STEWART. ROSEWATER.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
