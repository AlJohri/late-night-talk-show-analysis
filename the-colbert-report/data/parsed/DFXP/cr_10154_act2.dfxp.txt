(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANKS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS SO MUCH! FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I LOVE THE OLIVE GARDEN. IT REALLY EVOKES THE AUTHENTIC CUISINE OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE SPOTS IN ITALY -- THE OLIVE GARDEN IN ROME. (LAUGHTER) AND JUST LIKE THE SLOGAN SAYS, WHEN I'M THERE, I'M FAMILY. WHICH IS WHY, WHEN I'M THERE, I WATCH TV IN MY UNDERWEAR. (LAUGHTER) UNFORTUNATELY, MY FAVORITE CHAIN JUST GOT KICKED IN THE MEATBALLS.
A MAJOR INVESTOR IS ATTEMPTING A TAKEOVER OF OLIVE GARDEN RELEASING 300 PAGES THAT SLAM THE RESTAURANT CHAIN'S FOOD AND SERVICE.
THE INVESTMENT GROUP RIPPED INTO THE COMPANY FOR EVERYTHING FROM SOGGY SALADS TO TASTELESS PASTA.
IN WHAT WOULD BE A DANGEROUS INSULT TO HURL AT MOST ITALIAN COOKS, IT CALLS THE PASTA MUSHY AND UNAPPEALING.
THEY MIGHT AS WELL SAY WE'RE NOT EVEN ITALIAN.
Stephen: OF COURSE, OLIVE GARDEN IS ITALIAN! I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKE, THEIR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS ARE IN ORLANDO. THAT IS MERE MILES FROM EPCOT ITALY! (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, THE REPORT, THIS REPORT THAT JUST GOT PUT OUT BY THESE INVESTORS IS ALL PART OF THE HEDGE FUND "STARBOARD VALUES'" AGGRESSIVE ATTEMPT TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE OLIVE GARDEN'S PARENT COMPANY, DARDEN RESTAURANTS. I MEAN, IT'S A HOSTILE-PITALIANO TAKEOVER! (LAUGHTER) STARBOARD LAID OUT THEIR CASE IN AN ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT POWERPOINT PRESENTATION. SLIDE 164 ASKS THE QUESTION, HOW DOES THE LARGEST ITALIAN DINING CONCEPT IN THE WORLD NOT SALT THE WATER FOR PASTA? ADDING -- IF YOU WERE TO GOOGLE "HOW TO COOK PASTA," THE FIRST STEP OF PASTA 101 IS TO SALT THE WATER. FIRST OF ALL, I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR. NOBODY AT OLIVE GARDEN IS GOOGLING "HOW TO COOK PASTA." AND MAYBE THEY DON'T SALT THE WATER, BUT THEY MAKE UP FOR THAT BY PUTTING SALT IN EVERYTHING ELSE -- THE SAUCE, THE SALAD, THE SOFT DRINKS, THE SALT. BELIEVE ME, NO ONE HAS EVER LEFT THE OLIVE GARDEN SAYING "I NEED MORE SODIUM." BUT HERE'S WHERE STARBOARD WENT OVERBOARD.
ONE HEDGE FUND SAYS IT HAS THE ANSWER TO THE RESTAURANT'S MONEY WOES -- TOO MANY BREADSTICKS. STARBOARD VALUE SAYS OLIVE GARDEN'S SERVERS BRING TOO MANY BREADSTICKS TO THE TABLE AT A TIME.
WHO KNEW THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS TOO MANY BREADSTICKS!
Stephen: WHAT THE (BLEEP)! STARBOARD, STARBOARD WANTS TO LIMIT MY BREADSTICKS? WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO NOW? EAT LIMITED BREAD IN NON-STICK FORM? WHAT ARE WE? ANIMALS? FOLKS, I AM SHOCKED BY THIS BLATANT ATTEMPT BY A FEW WALL STREET BIGSHOTS TO TAKE AWAY OUR CARBOHYDRATE RODS. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT HEDGE FUND MANAGERS WERE ON THE SIDE OF THE LITTLE GUY... BUT I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER WHETHER WALL STREET REALLY HAS EVERYONE'S BEST INTERESTS AT HEART. (LAUGHTER) DESTROYING THE WORLD ECONOMY IS ONE THING, BUT I DRAW THE LINE WHEN THEY COME FOR MY COMPLIMENTARY DINNER RODS. WALL STREET, DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT YOU'RE MEDDLING WITH FORCES BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSION? THE ONLY THING PREVENTING THE MASSES FROM RISING UP AGAINST YOU WAS THAT THEY WERE ALL TOO LOGY FROM THE BREADSTICKS. (LAUGHTER) BUT NOW IT'S GO TIME, MOTHER (BLEEP)! I SAY WE BRING DOWN THE WALL STREET FAT CAT PORTION-LIMIT-STAPO. WHO'S WITH ME? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LET'S GET 'EM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S JUST SCRATCH THAT.  I'M JUST GONNA, I'M JUST GONNA UNBUTTON MY PANTS FOR A SECOND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
