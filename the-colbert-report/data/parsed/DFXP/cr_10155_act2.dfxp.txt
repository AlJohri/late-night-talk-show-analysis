WELCOME BACK. FOLKS, I'M A BIG FAN, THANK YOU. I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE PENTAGON'S PROGRAM OF GIVING SURPLUS MILITARY GEAR TO LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THE PEACE IN THE UNSTABLE TRIBAL REGION OF SUBURBAN ST. LOUIS. BUT SOME FOLKS SAY POLICE DEPARTMENTS SHOULDN'T HAVE ALL THESE EQUIPMENT AND I AGREE BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE GOING TO OUR SCHOOLS.
NEW CONTROVERSY TONIGHT OVER THIS MILITARY GRADE ARMORED VEHICLE NOW IN THE HANDS OF SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SCHOOL DISTRICT.
HEY, THE SAN DIEGO SCHOOL DISTRICT NEEDS THAT MRAP TO DEFEND ITSELF IN CASE LOS ANGELES SCHOOL DISTRICTS GET GRENADE LAUNCHERS. WHICH THEY DID. BESIDES, AS THE SAN DIEGO SCHOOL DISTRICT POLICE CHIEF EXPLAINED, IT'S NOT AS SCARY AS IT LOOKS.
THERE WILL BE MEDICAL SUPPLIES IN THE VEHICLE. THERE WILL BE TEDDY BEARS IN THE VEHICLE.
Stephen: WHAT A VALUABLE LIFE LESSON, KIDS, WHEN YOU SEE AN URBAN MILITARY STRIKE VEHICLE, RUN TOWARDS IT FOR THE FREE TEDDY BEARS. AND THE DISTRICT, THE DISTRICT HAS TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO MAKE SURE THE MRAP DOES NOT SCARE THE KIDS. SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IS GOING TO ENLIST ITS SHOP CLASS TO GIVE IT A PAINT JOB, SEE? NOW IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A MINE RESISTANT AMBUSH PROTECTED AMBULANCE. ONLY THIS ONE DOESN'T NEED A SIREN BECAUSE THEY CAN JUST DRIVE RIGHT OVER THE TRAFFIC. FOLKS, I SAY THIS IS HOW WE CAN REASSURE EVERYONE ABOUT HAVING MILITARY VEHICLES ROLLING DOWN MAIN STREET AMERICA. BECAUSE AS HARMLESS AS THIS MRAP LOOKS HERE IT COULD LOOK EVEN MORE HARMLESSER. I SAY WE MOUNT A GIANT HOT DOG ON THE ROOF. NOW IT'S NO LONGER AN 18 TON ARMOURED MILITARY TRANSPORT, IT IS JUST THE OSCAR MEYER ASSAULT WEINER. OR EVEN BETTER, PEOPLE LOVE IT. PEOPLE LOVE IT. OR EVEN BETTER, WE ATTACH A SPEAKER TO THE TOP AND PLAY MUSIC TO TURN IT INTO AN ICE CREAM TRUCK. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, ICE CREAM, YOU SCREAM, WE ALL SCREAM WHEN THIS THING COMES DOWN THE STREET. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
