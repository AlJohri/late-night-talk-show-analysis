TONIGHT ARE AMERICANS ABUSE THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET? AND I CAN BE THE ONE THAT LOADS THEM NOT SOCIAL SAFETY CANON? THEN CONTROVERSY AT THE MISS AMERICA PAGEANT, MISS NORTH DAKOTA'S TALENT WAS FRACKING. AND MY GUEST ANDREW BACEVICH IS A RETIRED ARMY COLONEL WHO BELIEVES IN MANDATORY NATIONAL SERVICE. I WILL DODGE THE INTERVIEW BY FLEEING TO CANADA. (LAUGHTER) NPR IS CUTTING ITS STAFF BY 10%, SO ENGINE-- ENJOY THIS EDITION OF WIT WAIT, DON'T FIRE ME. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYONE.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, NATION! YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER BUT I DO. FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY LEHMAN BROTHERS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY TRIGGERING THE WORST FINANCIAL FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. BET YOU ALL HAD FORGOTTEN. BUT I EVEN GOT YOU A CAKE. THERE YOU GO. IT'S A, IT'S ACTUALLY A BUNCH OF CAKE, SOME FRESH, SOME SPOILED. BUNDLED INTO A LARGER CAKE DERIVATIVE, ALL RIGHT. NOW FAIR WARNING THERE MIGHT BE SOME POOP IN THERE TOO. (LAUGHTER) BUT IT'S MOSTLY CAKE. NOW FOLKS, IT FEELS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY THAT BANKS WERE TAKING UNETHICAL RISKS WITH EVERYONE'S MONEY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALSO DOING IT YESTERDAY. (LAUGHTER) BUT AMERICA IS DEFINED BY ITS RESILIENT-- RESILIENCE. NO MATTER WHAT MISTAKES WE MAKE, WE PICK OURSELVES UP, WE DUST OURSELVES OFF AND COME TOGETHER WITH THE COURAGE TO DENY THAT WE EVER MADE A MISTAKE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THESE PEOPLE GET IT IT'S LIKE THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT WHATEVER IT IS YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH HISTORY, I FORGET. THE POINT IS AMERICA'S ECONOMY IS BACK. THE DOW IS REACHING RECORD HIGHS. THE HOUSING MARKET IS REBOUNDING. THE AUTO INDUSTRY EXISTS. AND EVEN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FINDING GOOD JOBS IN CONSTRUCTION. AND FOLKS, THIS IS GOOD FOR EVERYONE. AS THEY SAY, A RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS. ALSO, BUY A BOAT OR YOU'LL DROWN. BECAUSE 9-- 95% OF INCOME GAINS SINCE THE RECOVERY HAVE GONE TO THE TOP 1%. BUT-- I KNOW, I WANT TO CHEER TOO. (LAUGHTER) BUT DON'T FRET NOT RICH PEOPLE. YOU WILL GET YOUR SHARE BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY IS LIKE A PYRAMID, OKAY. WE RICH ARE AT THE PEAK AND SOON THE MONEY WILL START TRICKLING DOWN TO YOU PEOPLE SO BE PATIENT. AND IF YOU ARE'S GOOD, YOU CAN BE BURIED WITH ME IN MY PYRAMID. (LAUGHTER) SO IF YOU ARE'S A MIDDLE CLASS AMERICAN, WONDERING WHERE ALL THE MONEY IN THIS RECOVERY WENT, DON'T WORRY, IT'S IN GOOD HANDS. (LAUGHTER) LIVING WITH ME NOW. BY THE WAY THE MONEY SAYS HI! IT WANTS YOU TO KNOW THAT IT'S HAPPY NOW AND IT WANTS YOU TO BE HAPPY TOO, BUT YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON. BECAUSE IT'S NOT COMING BACK. IN FACT, IT'S GONE TO A FARM UPSTATE. IN THAT I USED IT TO BUY A LARGE FARM UPSTATE. BUT FOLKS, JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONIES, DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. THEY ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE GOD EVER PUT ON THIS EARTH WHO GIVEN HALF A CHANCE THERE SUCK THE GOVERNMENT'S TEET UNTIL IT IS AS SCHRIFF ELED AS A BALLOON IN FEBRUARY. LOOK AT LAST MPT'S JOB REPORT, THE SHARE OF AMERICANS WHO ARE EITHER LOOK WORKING OR LOOKING FOR WORK IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 1978. BACK THEN THE ONLY GROWTH INDUSTRIES FROM $6 MILLION MANTECH SUPPORT, DISCO FEVER VACCINE RESEARCHER, AND FARRAH FAWCETT POSTER SQUEEGEE MEN. AND I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHOSE JOB IT IS TO CRITICIZE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT OF A JOB.
AKA THE TAKERS ARE EXPLODING WHILE THE LABOR FORCE, AKA THE MAKERS ARE IMPLODING.
IN A NATION OF HANDOUTS, WHO REALLY NEEDS A JOB. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SIGNING UP FOR FOOD STAMPS INCREASED BY AN AVERAGE OF 11,000 PER DAY THROUGHOUT THE OBAMA YEARS.
MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING FOOD STAMPS, CELL PHONES, HOUSING ASSISTANCE, RENTAL ASSISTANCE, HEATING ASSISTANCE, YOU NAME IT.
I NAME IT? OH, OH, I LOVE MAKE YOUR OWN NEWS, ALL RIGHT. FREE MARSHMALLOW PEEPS, SILLY STRAWS, ROLLS OF TIN FOIL, HOT TUB FULL OF CARAMEL, MAGICAL TALKING-- THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF STUFF I CAN IMAGINE THEY GET FOR FREE. THE POINT IS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THE POINT IS, THE POINT IS I des PIECE THESE MOOCHERS BECAUSE THEY DONE EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY TO des PIECE THEMSELVES. AND THAT FACT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, UNDER BARACK OBAMA ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS LIKE FOOD STAMPS HAVE EXPLODED. BUT I REMEMBER A TIME WHEN NEEDY AMERICANS DIDN'T FLAUNT THEIR LACK OF WEALTH.
LISTEN, I KNOW THERE IS A BIG THING TRYING TO DESTIGMATIZE FOOD STAMPS BUT THE GOOD PART ABOUT THE STIGMA IS IT ACTUALLY DOES SERVE AS AN IMPETUS TO GET PEOPLE OFF OF IT.
THIS EXPLOSION OF ENTITLEMENTS, AND THE SENSE OF SHAME IS GONE.
THERE IS NO SHAME ANY MORE.
SHOULDN'T THERE BE AT LEAST SOME STIGMA?
IT USED TO BE THAT SOMEBODY WAS ON FOOD STAMPS, IT WAS LAKE HEY, THEY'RE ON FOOD STAMPS, YOU KNOW, LOSER.
Stephen: YEAH. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE CHRIST SAID, BLESSED ARE THE MEEK BUT WHAT A BUNCH OF, YOU KNOW, LOSERS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE TOO LAZY TO WORK WHO ARE GAMING THE SYSTEM. IT'S ALSO PEOPLE TOO INJURED TO WORK.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE CLAIMING DISABILITY NOW.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT CAN BE CONSIDERED DISABILITY THESE DAYS AND GET SSI AT THE AGE OF 40 OR 50, YOUR BACK HURTS OR YOU HAVE A MOOD DISORDER. NOW THESE THINGS DID NOT EXIST WHEN WE WERE COMING UP.
A MOOD DISORDER?
Stephen: A MOOD DISORDER? I MEAN WHO HAS A MOOD DISORDER? [BLEEP] DO IT RIGHT! NOW WAIT A SECOND--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. TECHNICALLY THAT'S NOT A MOOD DISORDER, THAT'S A MOOD SUPERPOWER. (LAUGHTER) BUT FOLKS-- YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT, ALL OF THAT, THAT'S JUST TALK. ONE CRUSADER IN PORTLAND, OREGON, IS TAKING ACTION. WORKING ALONE, LIKE ALL GREAT AMERICAN HEROES. YOU'RE BATMAN, YOU'RE IRONMAN. AND FOLKS--  (LAUGHTER)
THIS, THIS NEW SUPERHERO DOES NOT FLY, HE FLIERS.
PORTLAND POLICE ARE NOW LOOKING INTO THE FLIERS FOUND AROUND PORTLAND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE THREATENING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AT LEAST 75 PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN THOSE FLYERS AND 14 NEIGHBORHOODS. NOW THE FLYER CLAIMS THOSE WITH DISABILITIES THREATEN DEMOCRACY BY ACCEPTING GOVERNMENT BENEFITS WHILE VOTING.
Stephen: YEAH, YOU SEE, IF YOU GET DISABILITY AND YOU VOTE, YOU MIGHT VOTE TO KEEP YOUR DISABILITY. IT'S SIMPLE. IT'S THE SAME WAY-- IT'S THE SAME WAY THAT IF YOU ARE'S ON FIRE AND YOU VOTE, YOU MIGHT VOTE TO KEEP THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. (LAUGHTER) BUT FOLKS, THE FLYERS DON'T JUST IDENTIFY THE DISABILITY PROBLEM. THEY PROMISE TO IDENTIFY THE DISABILITY PEOPLE, JIM?
THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT RECEIVING BENEFITS MAKES PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES A THREAT TO THE REPUBLIC, AND THEN WITH WHAT THE CITY SAYS IS AN UNDERLYING TONE OF VIOLENCE, THE AUTHOR STATES THAT THE NAMES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ARE NOW BEING POSTED WHERE THEY CAN BE SEEN BY TAXPAYERS.
Stephen: AND TO SET AN EXAMPLE OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY, THIS HERO SIGNED USING HIS REAL NAME, ARTEMUS OF THE WILDLANDS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. I ASSUME THAT IS HIS REAL NAME. NOW FOLKS, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, I THINK ARTIE IS RIGHT. WE NEED TO KNOW NAMES BECAUSE SOMETIMES I CAN'T TELL WHO'S DISABLED BY LOOKING AT THEM. AND THAT'S WHY THIS HERO IS GOING TO NAME NAMES SO THE NEIGHBORHOOD CAN DECIDE WHO IS TRULY DISABLED. I MEAN YEAH, WHAT DO THE DOCTOR WAS DIAGNOSE THEM KNOW. I WANT A SECOND OPINION FROM THE OLD GUY WHO WAVES AT TRAFFIC. IT'S LIKE, THINK OF IT LIKE THIS, IT'S LIKE WE'RE ALL JOINING NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH CALLING THE POLICE TO REPORT A SUSPICIOUS CAR. BUT FOR THE RECORD, I DON'T WANT TO BE COLD HEARTED ABOUT THIS. THESE DISABLED DESERVE MORE THAN A SNAP JUDGEMENT WHICH IS WHY COMMUNITIES SHOULD APPLY A STANDARDIZED TEST BY THROWING THE DISABLED IN THE RIVER. NOW-- IF, IT WORKS LIKE THIS. IF THEY DROWNED, IF THEY DROWN WE KNOW THEY WERE DISABLED. AND DESERVED EVERY PENNY OF GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE THAT SADLY THEY NO LONGER NEED IN THEIR WATERY GRAVE. NOW BUT IF, IF THEY DON'T DROWN, IF THEY DON'T DROWN THEY WERE MAKING IT AND WE SHOULD BURN THEM AT THE STAKE. NOW I KNOW-- I KNOW IT SOUNDS A LITTLE DRASTIC BUT FOLKS, WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO FEEL NO SHAME, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE SHAMELESS. AND THAT'S THE WORD.
