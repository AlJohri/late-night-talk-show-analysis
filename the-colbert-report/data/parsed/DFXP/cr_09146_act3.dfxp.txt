Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, MY SECOND GUEST TONIGHT IS THE DIRECTOR OF A NEW DOCUMENTARY, SALINGER, AND COAUTHOR OF A BOOK ALSO CALLED SALINGER. BUT IF THEY HAVE THE SAME NAME, HOW WILL I KNOW WHICH IS WHICH?  PLEASE WELCOME SHANE SALERNO. SHANE, THANKS FOR COMING AND JOINING ME. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: NOW --
I AM GOOD.
Stephen: AGAIN, I AM THE ONLY THIRSTY ONE HERE TONIGHT. NOW, SHANE, YOU ARE THE COAUTHOR OF A NEW BIOGRAPHY.
YES.
Stephen: OF J.D. SALINGER, YOU ARE ALSO THE WRITER AND THE DIRECTOR OF A NEW MOVIE AGAIN CALLED SALINGER.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY DID YOU THROW YOURSELF INTO THE LIFE OF SALINGER?  WHY IS HE YOUR WHITE WHALE?
HE WAS, THAT IS A GOOD WAY TO PUT IT. HIS LIFE IS SO EXTRAORDINARY. WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT J.D. SALINGER LOST THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE TO CHARLIE CHAPLAIN.
THIS IS WHAT A HIGH ROLLER SALINGER WAS. IF EUGENE O'NEILL'S DAUGHTER.
YES.
Stephen: AND AT AGE 16 WHO IS SHE DATING.
BETWEEN 16 AND 18, PETER ARNOLD.
Stephen: THE GREAT NEW YORK CARTOONIST.
J.D. SALINGER AND BASICALLY MARRIED CHARLIE CHAPLAIN ON HER 18TH BIRTHDAY.
Stephen: FROM 16 TO 18.
SHE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN.
Stephen: SALINGER GOES OFF TO FIGHT WORLD WAR II.
SHE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD AND MEETS COMARLY CHAPLAIN.
Stephen: BUT SHE IS HIS GIRLFRIEND WHEN HE GOES TO THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE AND READS IN THE NEWSPAPER, GUESS WHAT, YOUR GIRLFRIEND JUST MARRIED CHARLIE CHAPLAIN.
YES.
Stephen: WHO IS 53.
YEAH. AND SHE IS 18.
SHE IS 18, AND THAT CHANGED HIS LIFE FOREVER, EVERY WOMAN WAS COMPARED TO UNA, SHE REALLY IMPRINTED UPON HIM AN AGE AND PERIOD IN HIS LIFE.
Stephen: LET'S GET INTO WHAT I THINK IS REALLY THE SHOCKER IN THE BOOK, THE THING THAT REALLY REVEALS SAL JERRY IN HIS TOTALITY.
HE HAD ONE BALL. THAT IS A REVELATION IN HERE. I DID NOT KNOW THAT BEFORE I READ YOUR BOOK. IT IS TRUE, RIGHT?
IT IS ONE PARAGRAPH IN A 700 PAGE BOOK. BUT IT IS TRUE.
Stephen: IT IS. ONE PARAGRAPH, ONLY ONE BALL.
NOW --
Stephen: IS THAT WHY HE WENT FOR SUCH YOUNG WOMEN, YOUNG VIRTUAL VIN NATURAL WOMEN.
VIRGIN NATURAL AND HE WOULD SAY, NO, NO THEY ARE ALL LIKE THAT, THEY ARE ALL LIKE THAT.
.. I AM GOING TO TAKE THE FIFTH ON THAT ONE.
Stephen: HERE IS MY BEEF. HERE IS MY BEEF WITH YOU. WHY LET ME KNOW THESE THINGS ABOUT SALINGER?  HE WAS SOMEONE WHO GUARDED HIS PRIVACY AND I RESPECTED THAT PRIVACY BY NOT INTRUDING BECAUSE WHAT IF I FIND OUT THINGS ABOUT HIM THAT CREEP ME OUT?  I AM WORRIED IF I LEARN THINGS ABOUT SALINGER THAT I DON'T LIKE I WON'T LIKE HIS BOOKS ANYMORE IS THAT A DANGER?
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS SINCE THE PUBLICITY OF THE FILM AND THE FILM HAS BEEN RELEASED CATCHER IN THE RYE JUMPED TO NUMBER SEVEN ON AMAZON.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT A GUY WHO HASN'T REALLY -- HASN'T WRITTEN ANYTHING ANYBODY THOUGHT WAS REALLY ANY GOOD SINCE THE 1950'S?
SALINGER IS A IS A ONE-OF-A-KIND SINGULAR VOICE AND THE IDEA HE WORKED FOR 45 YEARS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND PUT THAT WORK IN A VAULT TO BE RELEASED STARTING IN 2,015.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU HOPE THOSE STORY ARE?  AND WHAT DO YOU HOPE THEY WEREN'T?
WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK -- WILL HATE THE MOST?
I THINK WHAT IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE TO SEE HIM COMPLETE THE GLASS FAMILY, TO SEE AN ARTIST COMPLETE SOMETHING THAT HE HAS BEEN WORKING ON FOR 40 YEAR. WE HAVE ONLY SEEN HALF OF THE PAINTING. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR. WE HAVE HALF OF THE PAINTING.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK HE DIDN'T LET US SEE?  HE WAS WRITING EVERY DAY AND THE STUFF IS REALLY OUT THERE AND I WILL TAKE IT ON FAITH. WHY DO YOU THINK HE WOULDN'T LET US SEE IT.
HIS RELIGION SAYS YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT FEEDS YOUR EGO.
Stephen: THAT SUCKS. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, YOU WORK IN HOLLYWOOD, SO YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT FEEDING AN EGO IS LIKE. BUT YOU KNOW HOW DELICIOUS IT IS TO FEED YOUR EGO?
BUT I THINK THAT THAT IS WHY. I MEAN, HE REALLY FELT THAT THE WORK ITSELF WAS THE REWARD, AND SO THAT AFTER HE PASSED AWAY A FEW YEARS IT WOULD BE EXACTLY FIVE YEARS AFTER HE PASSES AWAY THE WORK WILL START TO BE RELEASE SOD HE IS NOT THERE FOR THE EGO GRATIFICATION OF SEEING IT PUBLISHED, THAT IT IS JUST A PURE ARTIST DELIVERING HIS WORK TO AN AUDIENCE.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT SEYMOUR SHOOTS HIMSELF?
BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA SUFFERED IN WORLD WAR 2 AND SALINGER KNEW THAT EXTRAORDINARILY WELL, AND SALINGER WALKED INTO A CONCENTRATION CAMP AND NEVER WALKED OUT AND FOR THE TEST OF HIS LIFE HE WAS LIVING IN POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME AND OUR FILM DETAILS THAT AND I THINK IN AN UNPRECEDENTED FASHION SHOWS HOW DAMAGED HE REALLY WAS. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT WORLD WAR II AND SALINGER IS IF J.D. SALINGER HADN'T GONE TO WORLD WAR II WE WOULD HAVEN'T THIS WORK, SO, YOU KNOW,.
Stephen: SO MAYBE WE OWE HITLER MAYBE JUST A LITTLE APOLOGY. YOUR WORDS. YOUR WORDS. NOT MINE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: SHANE SALERNO, THE BOOK AND A MOVIE, SALINGER. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
