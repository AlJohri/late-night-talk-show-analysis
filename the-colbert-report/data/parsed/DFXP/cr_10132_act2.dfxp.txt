(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! FOLKS, ANYBODY WHO'S WATCHED THIS SHOW FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME KNOWS THAT I AM AN ENORMOUS FAN OF CELEBRITY POWER COUPLES LIKE BRANGELINA, KIMYE AND FILLIAM H. MUFFMAN. UNFORTUNATELY, THE WORLD RECENTLY COST SUPERSTAR ATHLETE COUPLE RORY McILROY AND CAROLINE WOZNIACKI, OR AS THEY'RE KNOWN BY THEIR POWER COUPLE NAME McCOROLLARY WINSOCKY. HE'S A PROFESSIONAL GOLFER, SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYER. AS SAD AS THE BREAKUP IS, FORTUNATELY, EACH HAS MOVED ONTO THE SIXTH STAGE OF GRIEF, WINNING AN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS TOURNAMENT. ON SUNDAY, WOZNIACKI WON THE, THE ISTANBUL CUP AND MCILROY WON THE BRITISH OPEN. IN FACT, McILROY WAS SO EXCITED HE WAS SEEN MAKING OUT WITH HIS NEW TROPHY GIRLFRIEND, A TROPHY THIS TALE OF PRIVATE HEARTACHE AND PUBLIC TRIUMPH  CAN MEAN ONLY ONE THING BREAKUPS ARE THE ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUG. MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN HUMAN HISTORY HAVE BEEN FUELED BY A BITTER BREAKUP. WHO CAN FORGET HOW AFTER WATCHING THE FIRST ATOMIC BOMB GO OFF, ROBERT OPPENHEIMER FAMOUSLY SAID, I AM BECOME DEATH, DESTROYER OF WORLDS BECAUSE YOU DESTROYED MY WORLD, KIMBERLY. (LAUGHTER) TRUE STORY. AND, OF COURSE, THERE WERE NEIL ARMSTRONG'S ICONIC WORDS FROM THE MOON LANDING.
ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MAN KIND. AND ONE HUGE (BLEEP) YOU TO SHERYL. LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON. I'M ON THE MOON. I DIDN'T RUN INTO YOUR FRIEND ANDREW UP HERE.
Stephen: SO CAROLINE IF YOU DECIDE TO TAKE RORY BACK, DO IT IN TIME FOR HIM TO BREAK UP WITH YOU BEFORE THE U.S. OPEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
