Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. PITTSBURGH PENGUIN, PITTSBURGH  PENGUIN, CHEERIO, JOLLY GOOD TO  HAVE YOU WITH US. WOT, WOT. AS YOU CAN TELL, I AM STILL IN  THE THROES OF ROYAL BABY FEVER  WHICH HAS ME WORRIED BECAUSE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STARVE A  ROYAL BABY COLD AND FEED A ROYAL  BABY FEVER AND I DON'T WANT TO EAT ENGLISH FOOD. ME AND THE ROYAL BABY HAVE SO  MUCH IN COMMON IN THAT BOTH OF  OUR FONTANELLES ARE NOT CLOSED  YET. IT'S LIKE A KOOSH BALL UP THERE. OF COURSE, ONCE THE HEIR  ARRIVED, THERE WAS ONLY ONE  QUESTION ON EVERY NEWSMAN'S MIND: HOW LONG IS THIS STILL  NEWS? THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, UNTIL WE  GET A BABY NAME. DAMMIT.
BRITAIN'S NEW PRINCE IS NAMED  PRINCE GEORGE OF CAMBRIDGE. THE ROYAL BABY'S FULL NAME IS  GEORGE ALEXANDER LOUIS.
Stephen: OH, THERE'S GOING TO  BE ANOTHER KING GEORGE. OH, THAT MAKES ME WANT TO  VIOLENTLY ESTABLISH OUR  INDEPENDENCE ALL OVER AGAIN. YES, I DO. WHO IS IS CRAZY? YOU WERE? WHO PEED BLUE? YOU DID. SO CRAZY. NOW, FOLKS, THERE'S A LOT OF  SPECULATION OVER WHAT THESE  NAMES WOULD BE BUT I FOR ONE AM NOT SURPRISED BECAUSE AS A ROYAL  WATCHER, I KNOW THAT WILL AND  KATE ARE HUGE FANS OF SEINFELD, AND CLEARLY NAMED THE BABY FOR  GEORGE COSTANZA WHO IS PLAYED BY  JASON ALEXANDER AND JULIA  LOUIS-DREYFUSS. BECAUSE... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ... BECAUSE JUST LIKE SEINFELD,  THE ENGLISH ROYAL FAMILY IS  REALLY ABOUT NOTHING. MEANWHILE, ANTHONY WEINER'S  PENIS. YES, I KEPT THAT IN AS LONG AS I  COULD. JUST LIKE ANTHONY WEANER. YES, NEW YORK, NEW YORK, THE  CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS JUST GOT  ONE MORE THING TO KEEP IT UP AT NIGHT BECAUSE YESTERDAY THE  THINKABLE HAPPENED.
JIM? TWO YEARS AFTER A TAWD SEXING  SCANDAL CHASED HIM FROM  CONGRESS, ANTHONY WEINER IS BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS AGAIN. TURNS OUT HE CONTINUED SENDING  LEWD MESSAGES AND PHOTOS TO AT  LEAST ONE WOMAN EVEN AFTER HE WAS FORCED TO RESIGN FROM  CONGRESS
Stephen: YES, EVEN AFTER THE  SEXT-ING SCANDAL THAT ENDED HIS  CONGRESSIONAL CAREER. IT TURNS OUT HE LEARNED NOTHING. HAS THIS MAN NEVER HEARD OF  SNAPCHAT? YOUR DONG SHOTS DISAPPEAR  SECONDS AFTER YOU SEND THEM. I HAVE BEEN TOLD. ANYWAY, HERE'S BASICALLY WHAT  HAPPENED. 50 DAYS BEFORE THE MAYORAL  PRIMARY, NEW SEXY TEXTS AND  PHOTOS OF THE CANDIDATE WERE PUBLISHED ON THE WEBSITE, "THE  DIRTY."  THE DIRTY, OF COURSE, THE "NEW  YORK TIMES" OF CELEBRITY SCHLONG  PHOTOS. THEIR MOTTO: ALL THE DICKS THAT  FIT TO PIC. NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I  WANT YOU TO BRACE YOURSELF. I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU ONE OF THE  PICTURES. WARNING: IF THERE ARE CHILDREN  IN THE ROOM, YOU'RE GOING TO  WISH THERE WEREN'T. JIM JIM? OKAY. OKAY, EVERYBODY BREATHE. LOOKS LIKE HE GOT IT CAUGHT IN A  WAFFLE IRON. A SERIES OF PAINT SWATCHES. THAT LAST COLOR IS CALLED PUBLIC  HUMILIATION. JIM, JIM, CAN WE MOVE ON,  PLEASE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW, IN RESPONSE, YESTERDAY  WEINER HELD AN EMERGENCY PRESS  CONFERENCE.
I HAVE SAID THAT OTHER SEX  TINGE PHOTOS WERE LIKELY TO COME  OUT. TODAY THEY HAVE. THE BEHAVIORS ARE BEHIND ME. I'M BLEESED AND BLESSED THAT MY  WIFE HUMAHAS GIVEN ME A SECOND  CHANCE
Stephen: HE'S ALSO BLESSED  THAT SHE'S STILL COUNTING THIS  AS THE SECOND CHANCE. SHE IS EITHER VERY FORGIVING OR  TERRIBLE AT MATHMENT EITHER WAY,  AT LEAST HE'S TAKING PERSONAL  RESPONSIBILITY.
MY WIFE AND I, AS I HAVE  SAID, ARE MOVING FORWARD  TOGETHER. MY WIFE AND I, WE WENT THROUGH  THIS PROCESS. WE PUT IT BEHIND US. WE'RE IN A LOT BETTER PLACE  TODAY. WE KNEW, WE DECIDED, WE, WE, WE,  IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD  WORKED THROUGH TOGETHER
Stephen: YES, TOGETHER BOTH  HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE WORKED  THROUGH THEIR MUTUAL ROLES IN HIS SECRETLY SENDING WOMEN  PICTURES OF HIS CRANK. BY THE WAY... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TWO-WAY STREET. BY THE WAY, ALL THIS  CYBER-FLASHING HAPPENED JUST  LAST SUMMER. AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS TELLING  PEOPLE MAGAZINE "I FEEL LIKE A  DIFFERENT PERSON." TURNS OUT IT WAS TRUE. HE WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON  BECAUSE HE SENT THESE PENIS  SHOTS OR "DICTURES," UNDER THE SCREEN NAME CARLOS DANGER. NOW, I ASSUME... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] VERY DISTINGUISHED. I ASSUME IT WAS TO AVOID USING A  RIDICULOUS NAME LIKE ANTHONY  WEINER. AND, FOLKS, I FOUND HIS  REASSURANCES ONLY MORE ALARMING.
THIS IS ENTIRELY BEHIND ME. IT'S IN OUR REAR VIEW MIRROR.
Stephen: DEAR, GOD. IF THAT'S IN OUR REAR VIEW  MIRROR, OBJECT MAY BE CLOSER  THAN IT APPEARS. BUT FOLKS, FOLKS, THIS PHOTO IS  ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. WELL, AND SOME OF THE SHAFT. BECAUSE WEINER ALSO SENT HIS  INTERNET CHAT-CHICA LEWD TEXT  MESSAGES AND I WOULD NOT BE DOING MY JOB AS A JOURNALIST IF  I DID NOT READ THEM ALLOWED ON  NATIONAL TV. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S ALL HERE IN THE NEW YORK  POST WHERE I READ ALL MY  PRINTED-OUT INTERNET. THEY'VE... YOU CAN SEE THEY  BLANKD OUT SOME OF THE WORDS  HERE. SOME OF THE NAUGHTY BITS ARE  BLANKED OUT. BUT I'M SURE I CAN FIGURE OUT  WHAT WAS THERE. OKAY. "SO, I WALK INTO A HOTEL ROOM  AND YOU ARE AT THE END OF THE  BED NAKED EXCEPT FOR SOME AMAZING BLANK-ME SHOES. HMMMM. "RESPECT-ME" SHOES. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I'M WRONG. YOU KNOW, JUST TO BE SURE, I  THINK THE FULL TEXTS ARE ONLINE. LET ME JUST SEE. OKAY. LET'S GO TO "THE DIRTY. I WANT TO SAY DOT-GOV AT THIS  POINT. OKAY. HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. OKAY. HE WRITES "STILL HOLDING YOUR  HAIR. I SPREAD YOUR LEGS, YOUR... OH. (MUMBLING) OH, "YOUR..." OH. OKAY. HE TAKE OUT MY... OH, NO. I LEAN OVER AND... PLEASE. NO. [BLEEP]. OKAY. I BEND DOWN, GRAB THE... EWW. I PUT MY TONGUE DEEP IN YOUR  MOUTH. YOU GRAB MY... OOF. OH, MY GOD. LET ME SEE. WILL YOU LET ME HOLD YOUR HAIR  WHILE YOU GAG... JESUS CHRIST. OH, NO. OH, NO. OKAY. THAT'S IT, FOLKS. I JUST... I DON'T CARE WHAT HIS  WIFE THINKS. THESE ARE SERIOUS TIMES. THIS CITY HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS. AND I DO NOT WANT ANTHONY WEINER  AS MY MAYOR. I WANT CARLOS DANGER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CARLOS DANGER. A MAN OF WHATEVER THE OPPOSITE  OF MYSTERY IS. JUST THINK ABOUT IT, FOLKS. A YEAR AFTER BEING HOUNDED FROM  OFFICE IN NATIONAL, NAY, GLOBAL  DISGRACE FOR RECREATIONAL CROTCH PHOTOGRAPHY, DOES HE STOP? NO, HE PRESSES ON. THAT'S THE KIND OF SINGLE-MINDED  DEDICATION YOU NEED AS MAYOR OF  NEW YORK CITY BECAUSE AS MAYOR CARLOS DANGER WILL FACE  IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGES EVERY DAY. BUT HE WON'T JUST THROW UP HIS  HANDS BECAUSE THOSE HANDS WILL  ALWAYS BE OCCUPIED. PLUS LET'S FACE IT. YOU WANT TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT,  SAY NO MORE. AND MAYOR DANGER WOULD NEVER BE  SCARED TO GO TOE-TO-"I HOPE  THAT'S A TOE" WITH WALL STREET OR TEACHERS' UNIONS OR THE MOB. HE'S NOT SCARED OF ANYTHING  BECAUSE CARLOS DANGER'S MIDDLE  NAME IS ALSO DANGER. OF COURSE, WE CAN'T EXPECT  CARLOS DANGER TO SING HIS OWN  PRAISES. HE'S A HUMBLE GUY UNLESS YOU'RE  A IMPRESSIONABLE YOUNG WOMAN  WITH A SMART PHONE. SO TONIGHT MY GRAPHICS TEAM HAS  CREATED AN ANIMATED TRIBUTE TO  WHAT THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NEW YORK CAN EXPECT UNDER THE DANGER  ADMINISTRATION. JIM? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I'LL SAVE YOU. CARLOS DANGER. SECRET MAYOR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: FOLKS, THIS NOVEMBER  , I CERTAINLY HOPE  YOU'LL BE THINKING OF CARLOS DANGER WHEN YOU YANK THAT LEVER. NOW, IN OTHER POLITICAL NEWS,  FOLKS, YESTERDAY VIRGINIA  GOVERNOR BOB McDONNELL  APOLOGIZED FOR ACCEPTING $120,000 IN INAPPROPRIATE LOANS  FROM A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT MAKER  WHO ALSO FUNDED A $15,000 NEW YORK SHOPPING TRIP FOR THE  GOVERNOR'S WIFE. AND... ANY PICS OF HIS PEENER OR  ANYTHING LIKE THAT? THEN WHY AM I WASTING YOUR TIME? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
