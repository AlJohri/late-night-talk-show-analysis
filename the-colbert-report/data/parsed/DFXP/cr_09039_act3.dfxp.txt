Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS HERE TO TALK  ABOUT THE FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE  OF WIKIPEDIA. THE NEUTRALITY OF THIS INTERVIEW  WILL BE DISPUTED. PLEASE WELCOME JAKE JIMMY WALES. HEY, JIMMY NICE TO SEE YOU  AGAIN. THANKS.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. FIRST OFF DO YOU NOT WEAR TIES  IN THE INTERNET WORLD?
TIES? NO, NO, NOT REALLY.
Stephen: WIKIPEDIA ONE OF  THOSE LOOSEY GOOSY PLACES WHERE  YOU HANG OUT ON BEAN BAGS ALL DAY LONG AND PLAY PAP POP A  SHOT.
PING PONG.
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU  AGAIN. THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE WAS  RIGHT AFTER I SAVED THE HE  ELEPHANTS.
I REMEMBER THAT.
Stephen: SIX YEARS NOW. SINCE YOU WERE LAST ONE  WIKIPEDIA WAS BEEN UBIQUITOUS --  I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS -- GO TO SITE FOR BILLIONS AROUND  THE WORLD. 19 BILLION PAGE VIEWS A MONTH. YOU MUST BE ROLLING IN THE CASH. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT? RIGHT? WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS MODEL?
WELL, WE'RE A CHARITY. AND WE EXIST FROM DONATIONS FROM  THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
Stephen: OKAY, SO YOU HAVE  NO BUSINESS MODEL.
NONE, WHATSOEVER.
Stephen: FRANKLY THAT'S WHY  I WANT TO HAVE YOU ON. THIS IS IT AN INTERVENTION. [ LAUGHTER ] IN DECEMBER, YOU WENT ON AND  WENT TO WIKIPEDIA IN DECEMBER? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU HAD THAT BANNER ACROSS THE  TOP IT WAS YELLOW WITH RED  LETTERING. SUPER PANICKY LIKE HAZARDOUS  WASTE SPILL SAYING WE'RE ALL  GOING TO DIE UNLESS YOU GIVE WIKIPEDIA MONEY? HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED?
WEAPON SPENT AROUND $28, 29  MILLION. HIGHER FOR NEXT YEAR.
Stephen: FORGIVE ME IF I'M  MISTAKEN. 8 5,000 WRITER EDITORS UNPAID?
UNPAID.
Stephen: WHERE IS THE $28  MILLION GOING, JIM? IF YOU DON'T SAY MY FLEET OF  CIGARETTE BOATS IN BOCA. WHY DO YOU NEED $28 MILLION FOR  SOMETHING OTHERS ARE DOING?
WE NEED THE SERVERS, THE  TECHNICAL STAFF.
Stephen: GODADDY.COM. THEY CAN HANDLE THAT, RIGHT?
NO. IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED.
Stephen: REALLY $28 MILLION  JUST TO RUN THE NUTS AND BOLTS  OF IT.
WE DO. A PORTION GOES TO THAT. OUTREACH.
Stephen: WHAT IS OUTREACH? WIKIPEDIA IS OUTREACH, WHAT DO  YOU MEAN OUTREACH?
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE  FOCUSED ON IS THE GROWTH OF  WIKIPEDIA IN THE DEVELOPING  WORLD. GETTING PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND  THE WORLD TO CONTRIBUTE IN THEIR  OWN LANGUAGE.
Stephen: CHINA HAS THEIR  OWN TWITTER. DO THEY HAVE THEIR CHINA-PEDIA.
BAIDU, WHICH YOU MENTIONED  THEY COPY EVERYTHING FROM  WIKIPEDIA AND CALL IT BAIDU.
Stephen: I DO THE SAME  THING AND I CALL IT GUEST  RESEARCH. [ LAUGHTER ]
WE DO EXIST IN CHINA. WE WERE BANNED FOR THREE YEARS  IN CHINA. WE'RE MOSTLY AVAILABLE. THEY STILL FILTER CERTAIN PAGES  ON SENSITIVE TOPICS.
Stephen: WHAT IS SENSITIVE  TO THE CHINESE? RACIALLY SENSITIVE? I KNOW YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO  BE RACIALLY INSENSITIVE TO  ASIANS.
APPARENTLY NOT. THINGS LIKE TIEN MEN SQUARE. TAIWANEES INDEPENDENCE.
Stephen: SURE. TIE BET EXISTING. THAT'S A SORE SUBJECT. YOU HAVE CRUSHED BRITANNICA. YOU DESTROYED IT. THEY NO LONGER PRINT.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: HOW AM I SUPPOSED  TO PRESS MY FLOARL RARNGMENTS. DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO  DRY A CALLA LILY BETWEEN TWO  IPADS? WHAT IS THE NEXT THING? WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF WIKIPEDIA?
WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE  FOCUSED ON IS GROWTH IN THE  DEVELOPING WORLD. THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE A  TRAVEL SITE THAT IS OPENING UP  SOON. WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.
Stephen: WIKITRAVEL?
IT'S NOT WIKITRAVEL IT'S  WIKIVOYAGER.
Stephen: YOU TRAVEL SOME  PLACE AND SAID I LOVE THE  ATMOSPHERE, TRY THE WIN.
EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: I'D GOOD TO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] WILL YOU HAVE A BUSINESS MODEL  FOR THAT?
NO.
Stephen: WHY WON'T YOU TAKE  ADVERTISING? IT'S SO EASY. PRODUCT PLACEMENT. UNDER MARIE ANTOINE NET'S LET  THEM EAT KATE ENTRY HAVE AN AD. THINK ABOUT IT.
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH,  JIMMY. WIKIPEDIA FOUNDER
