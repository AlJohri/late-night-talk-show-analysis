(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. THANKS SO MUCH. NATION, IT'S NO SECRET BARACK OBAMA WANTS TO INDOCTRINATE OUR STUDENTS WITH HIS SOCIALIST AGENDA. I'VE EVEN HEARD DISTURBING RUMORS THAT KINDERGARTENERS ARE BEING FORCED TO SHARE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY I'VE LONG OPPOSED HIS COMMON CORE CURRICULUM WHICH SETS UNIFORM EDUCATION STANDARDS ACROSS ALL A 50 STATES. NO WAY! DIFFERENT STATES HAVE DIFFERENT VALUES. I DON'T WANT MY KID ENDING UP IN COLORADO'S DRUG EDUCATION COURSE, WHICH CLASSIFIES WEED AS A CONDIMENT. (LAUGHTER) BUT I MAY BE COMING AROUND ON THE COMMON CORE, BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT COMMON CORE TESTING PREPARES OUR STUDENTS FOR WHAT THEY'LL FACE AS ADULTS. POINTLESS STRESS AND CONFUSION. (LAUGHTER) NEW COMMON CORE STANDARDS STRAIGHT FROM THE GOVERNMENT BEING ADOPTED IN 45 STATES AND CONFUSING THE HECK OUT OF PARENTS.
CRITICS SAY THESE TESTS ARE HURTING, NOT HELPING STUDENTS.
THE KIDS ARE ANXIOUS AND UPTIGHT.
IT'S STRESSFUL. RIDICULOUS. I WOULDN'T ALLOW MY KIDS TO TAKE THE TEST TODAY. THEY WERE STRESSING OVER IT AND THEY WERE GETTING UPSET.
Stephen: OH, COME ON! TESTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE STRESSFUL! THAT'S WHY THEY CALLED IT A BLOOD PRESSURE TEST WHICH I ACED WITH A 1600. WHAT ARE ARE THE KIDS SO WORRIED ABOUT? LOOK AT THIS MATH QUESTION. FIND JACK'S ERROR, THEN WRITE A LETTER TO JACK TELLING HIM WHAT HE DID RIGHT AND WHAT HE SHOULD DO TO FIX HIS MISTAKE. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. TEACHES TWO IMPORTANT WORKPLACE SKILLS -- MATH AND PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE NOTE WRITING. IT'S GOING TO COME IN HANDY! (APPLAUSE) FOLKS, WE ALL KNOW IT'S GOING TO COME IN HANDY WHEN YOU HAVE TO LEAVE POST IT NOTES ABOUT PROPER YOGURT ETIQUETTE IN THE BREAK ROOM FRIDGE. FOLKS, THAT WORD PROBLEM COULDN'T BE EASIER TO SOLVE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CHECK THE SEMICIRCLES ON THE TWO-SIDED ARROW, PUT THE NUMBERS UP IN IT AND, BING, BANG, MATH! THE SAME THING I DO WHEN I GET A CHECK AT A RESTAURANT. DRAW A BUNCH OF SHAPES AND TELL THE WAITRESS TO FIND MY ERROR, AND I FOR ONE DO NOT SEE WHY KIDS AREN'T NAILING TOTAL GIMMES LIKE THIS NEXT QUESTION. MIKE SAW 17 BLUE CARS AND 25 GREEN CARS IN THE TOY STORE, HOW MANY CARS DID HE SEE? WRITE A NUMBER SENTENCE WITH A GREY BOX FOR THE MISSING NUMBER. EXPLAIN HOW THE NUMBER SENTENCE SHOWS THE PROBLEM. THAT'S EASY. AND IF FOR SOME REASON YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A NUMBER SENTENCE IS, I'M SURE YOU COULD USE A WORD EQUATION OR A FORMULA PARAGRAPH. AND THERE'S HARD PROOF THAT THE COMMON CORE IS ALREADY OPENING OUR CHILDREN'S MINDS TO NEW WAYS OF THINKING. JUST LOOK AT THIS ACTUAL ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION GIVEN BY A CALIFORNIA SECOND GRADER. 17 PLUS 25 EQUALS 42. I GOT THE ANSWER BY TALKING IN MY BRAIN AND I AGREED OF THE ANSWER THAT MAY BRAIN GOT. (LAUGHTER) IN FACT, THAT IS THE SAME ANSWER I AGREED OF IN MY BRAIN. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS CHILD HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE. HE'S ONLY IN SECOND GRADE AND CAN ALREADY CLEARLY EXPLAIN WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO THINK. NOW WE JUST NEED TO GET HIM TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE TO WHOEVER WROTE THE COMMON CORE QUESTION. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
