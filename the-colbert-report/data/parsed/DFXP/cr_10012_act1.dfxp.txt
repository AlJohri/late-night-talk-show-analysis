Stephen: TONIGHT WAS'S THE BEST WAY TO SAVE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES? I USE A ZIPLOC BAG! PLUS THE LATEST BREAKTHROUGH IN AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE. OLD McDONALD'S HAS A METH LAB. (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST STEPHEN FRY IS KNOWN AS A RENAISSANCE MAN. WELL I'M GOING TO GO MEDIEVAL ON HIS ASS. A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS PLANTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TELL TIME. GOOD, BECAUSE FOR CHRISTMAS I GOT MY FICUS A SWATCH. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
SELF-EN, STEPHEN, STEVE EBB! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. FOLKS, IF YOU KNOW ME AN I HOPE YOU DO, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW I WILL DO ANYTHING IN MY POWER TO SUPPORT OUR MILITARY SHORT OF ENLISTING. (LAUGHTER) FRANKLY, FOLKS, I CANNOT EVEN LOOK AT OUR SO-CALLED COMMANDER IN CHIEF. JIMMY, CAN I GET A PICTURE OF HIM PLEASE. THANK YOU. (LAUGHTER) HE IS ALWAYS WEAKENING OUR MILITARY PREPAREDNESS AND UNITY COHESION. FIRST HE GETS RID OF DON'T ASK DON'T TELL. SUDDENLY AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN SOUNDS LIKE DATE NIGHT. AND NOW, NOW THIS.
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE IS THINKING ABOUT SPENDING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF YOUR DOLLARS TO BUY OUR MARINES NEW HATS OR AS THEY CALL THEM COVERS. AND HERE'S THE PROBLEM. APPARENTLY NOT MANY WANT TO WEAR THEM. SOME PEOPLE THINK THE NEW HAT LOOKS FAR TOO GIRLLY.
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE FEM ANYIZATION OF THE MARINE CORPS.
Stephen: CLEARLY THE FEM ANYIZATION OF MARINE CORP. I MEAN THEY'RE CUTTING OFF THE BALLS OF MONTEZUMA. IT'S SEMPER FI, NOT SEARCH BI. AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS ENRAGED. NEW YORKS' "THE NEW YORK POST" SAID IT LOOKS LIKE IT CAME FROM THE SHOPS OF CHRISTOPHER STREET. (LAUGHTER) WELL, THEN SI HAVE TO ASSUME THE NEW HAT IS A NEON MESH AND SECURED WITH A BALL GAG. ALL RIGHT, JIM, LET'S SEE THIS NEW GIRLIE HAT-AS TROPHY NEXT TO THE CURRENT DENY. OH, O MY GOD, LOOK AT THAT I JUST CANNOT TELL WHICH ONE IS THE NEW ONE. (LAUGHTER) WHICH ONE-- OH, IT'S THE ONE ON THE RIGHT, THE ONE ON THE RIGHT, YEAH, HATE THOSE. IT'S SO FEMININE, I'M JUST OVULATING LOOKING AT THEM. (LAUGHTER) THIS HAT MIGHT AS WELL BE MADE OF TAMPONS AND COPIES OF EAT, PRAY, LOVE. I MEAN THOSE TWO INCHES OF EXTRA BRIM IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARINE AND MAUREEN. NOW SURE, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE SAYS THE PROPOSED HAT IS BASED ON THE ONE WORN BY WORLD WAR I HERO AND TWO TIME MEDAL OF HONOR WINNER SERGEANT MAJOR DAN DALEY. WHAT DOES THAT GUY KNOW ABOUT BEING MANLY. HE'S WEARING TWO NECKLACES AND A BROACH. ALL THAT IS MISSING IS THE MATCHING EARRINGS. MARK MY WORDS, FOLKS. NEXT OBAMA WILL HAVE THE ARMY RANGERS IN BARRATTS AND DRESS THE NAVY UP IN LITTLE SAILOR SUITS. WE'RE NOT SELLING CRACKER JACKS HERE. OH, AND YOU CAN FORGET WEARING CAMEO, SOON OUR SOLDIERS WILL ALL BE WEARING GEORGIA O'KEEFFE PAINTINGS. (LAUGHTER) AND THAT REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING. THAT REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING. I DON'T-- IF ANYTHING, FOLKS, IF ANYTHING, OUR MILITARY HATS SHOULD BE MORE MANLY. I SAY WE MAKE THEM OUT OF BEEF JERKY AND SHARK'S TEETH. THAT IS JUST ME. FOLKS, NATION, FOLKS, I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT ALL THE CHARITABLE WORK I DO. THAT'S WHAT MY PUBLICIST IS FOR. BUT I DO DO IT. AND I REALIZE I JUST SAID DO-DO. (LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS I'M A GREAT GUY. EVEN THOUGH I DON'T GIVE TO CHARITY ANY MORE. BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT. YOU SEE, OUR STAGNANT ECONOMY HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON ALL CHARITABLE GIVING. DONATIONS TO THE TOP 400 CHARITIES ARE DOWN THIS YEAR, EVEN MY CHARITY, THE STEPHEN AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION HAS HAD TO CUT BACK ON OUR IMPORTANT WORK OF FIGURING OUT WHAT WE WERE RAISING MONEY FOR. WE WERE THIS CLOSE TO A CAUSE. FORTUNATELY ONE ORGANIZATION OUT THERE IS USING THE FREE MARKET TO CREATE PROPER INCENTIVES FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PHILAN-TROPHY. FOLKS, NOTHING TUGS AT THE HEART STRINGS MORE THAN ANIMAL CHARITIES. ALTHOUGH I FOR ONE DON'T KNOW WHY SARAH McLACHLAN HAS IMPRISONED ALL OF THOSE DOGS AND CATS. LET THEM GO, YOU MONSTER! (LAUGHTER) AND I BELIEVE IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO PROTECT OUR DWINDLING ENDANGERED SPECIES. ESPECIALLY, FOLKS, ESPECIALLY THE BLACK RHINO. YOU SEE, THERE ARE-- THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 5,000 OF THESE MA GUESS PARTICULAR CREATURES LEFT IN THE WORLD, DOWN 96% SINCE THE MID 70s. NOW ONE OF THE REASONS THEY HAVE BEEN DYING OUT IS POACHERS ARE KILLING THEM AND HARVESTING THEIR PARTS FOR TRADITIONAL MEDICINE. FOR INSTANCE, IN CHINA IT'S BELIEVED POWDERED BLACK RHINO HORN CAN CURE A WIDE VARIETY OF AILMENTS FROM SNAKEBITES TO DEVIL POSSESSION. WOW, THOSE CHINESE HAVE SOME CRAZY BELIEFS. EVERYBODY KNOWS THE WAY TO CURE DEVIL POSSESSION IS WITH HOLY WATER. (LAUGHTER) NOW LUCKILY-- LUCKILY, FOLKS, ONE GROUP HAS STEPPED FORWARD WITH A BOLD CONSERVATION PLAN, THE DALLAS SAV ARI CLUB HAS ANNOUNCED THEY WILL SAVE THE ENDANGERED BLACK RHINO BY AUCTIONING OFF THE CHANCE TO SHOOT ONE. LIKE THE OLD SAYING, IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING, SET IT FREE. THEN WHEN IT HAS A BIT OF A HEAD START, OPEN FIRE. AND, FOLKS, THE SAVVY CLUB SPOKESMAN IS APPROACHING THE SENSITIVE SUBJECT OF SACRIFICING AN ENDANGERED SPECIES FOR THE GREATER GOOD, WITH ALL THE GRAVITY YOU COULD HOPE FOR.
THE DALLAS SAFARI CLUB WILL BE AUCTIONING OFF A BLACK RHINO HUNT IN NAMIBIA AT THIS YEAR'S CONVENTION. I'M SUPER STOKED ABOUT THIS. FOLKS, THE MONEY GOES TO SOMETHING INCREDIBLE, THE TROPHY IS JUST ASTRONOMICALMENT COY NOT IMAGINE HAVING A BLACK RHINO. I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW RARE THIS IS.
BEST OF ALL, THE MORE YOU SHOOT, THE RARER IT GETS. NOW THE SAFARI CLUB IS AUCTIONING OFF A SPECIAL RHINO HUNTING PERMIT FROM THE NAMIBIAN GOVERNMENT, EXPECTED TO RAKE IN THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLARS, ALL OF WHICH GOES DIRECTLY TO NAMIBIA'S BLACK RHINO CONSERVATION TRUST. AND FOLKS, THE RHINOS, IF ANY OF YOU ARE WORRIED, THE RHINOS WILL NEVER EVEN NOTICE. AS DALLAS SAFARI CLUB EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BEN CARTER SAID BLACK RHINOS TEND TO HAVE A FAIRLY HIGH MORTALITY RATE. GENERALLY SPEAKING OUT OF A POPULATION OF 2,000, HARVESTING THREE RHINOS OVER A COUPLE OR THREE YEARS HAS NO IMPACT ON THE HEALTH OF THE RHINO HERD AT ALL. YES, THERE ISN'T MUCH IMPACT IF YOU KILL ONE RHINO OR THREE RHINOS, OR HOW ABOUT THIS, WE SHOOT ALL 5,000 REMAINING RHINOS THAT WILL BRING IN 3.7 BILLION DOLLARS, AND WE CAN USE THAT CASH TO KEEP ONE LAST RHINO SAVLY CONFINED. FOLKS, THIS IS THE ONLY, I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE THIS IS THE ONLY PRACTICAL WAY TO SAVE THE SPECIES. BECAUSE AS DALLAS SAV ARE CLUB DIRECTOR BEN CARTER FURTHER SAID, PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHY DON'T YOU DO A PHOTO SAFARI OR WHATEVER. THAT'S GREAT BUT PEOPLE DON'T PAY FOR THAT. HE'S RIGHT. NO ONE WILL PAY FOR A PHOTO. THAT'S NOT A TROPHY. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HANG A PHOTO ON YOUR WALL. BUT THINK ABOUT IT, IF WE REALLY WANT TO RAISE SOME CASH, YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE DO PAY FOR? THEY PAY FOR SEX. TO SAVE THIS ENDANGERED ANIMAL, THE DALLAS SAFARI CLUB SHOULD AUCTION OFF A NIGHT WE A RHINO. NOW I'M NOT SAYING-- FOLKS, I'M NOT SAYING THAT SOMEONE SHOULD GO [BLEEP] A BLACK RHINO. THAT'S SICK. I'M SAYING THEY SHOULD MAKE LOVE TO IT. (LAUGHTER) NOW IN THE MORNING, IN THE MORNING-- THAT MIGHT BE-- THAT IDEA IS VERY POPULAR WITH THE PEOPLE. IN 9 MORNING, IN THE MORNING YOU JUST LEAVE 750,000 DOLLARS ON THE DRESSER. IF YOU DON'T CALL THE FIX DAY SHE'LL UNDERSTAND. NATION, THIS DALLAS RHINO CLUB IDEA CAN RAISE MONEY FOR ALL SORTS OF IMPORTANT CAUSES. I MEAN WHO AMONGST US HASN'T SEEN A HOMELESS MANNING BEGGING ON THE STREETS AND FELT DEEP SADNESS THAT YOU COULD NOT HUNT HIM FOR SPORT. I MEAN NEW YORK CITY, THINK ABOUT THIS, NEW YORK CITY OPERA JUST RECENTLY HAD TO CLOSE FOR LACK OF FUNDS. IF ONLY THEY WOULD HAVE LET US HUNT THE FAT LADY. I MEAN I HAPPEN TO KNOW THEIR HORNS ARE AN APHRODISIAC IN NORWAY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION COULD REALLY USE THIS KIND OF FUND-RAISING TECHNIQUE? THE DALLAS SAFARI CLUB. I SAY WE JUST AUCTION OFF A CHANCE TO HUNT ONE MEMBER. I MEAN THEY'LL UNDERSTAND. I MEAN ALSO IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PELT. I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT, I MIGHT MAKE A VEST OUT OF IT. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
