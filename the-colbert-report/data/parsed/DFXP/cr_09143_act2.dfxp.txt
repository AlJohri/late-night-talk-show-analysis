Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH, FOLKS. IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW  I LOVE TECHNOLOGY, THAT'S WHY  SOMETIMES I JUST STARE AT MY MICROWAVE FOR HOURS AND HOURS. WHICH WAY WILL THE BURRITO TURN  NEXT? I DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S WHY I WAS SO EXCITED TO  SEE A GREAT NEW PRODUCT PROFILED  ON THE MOST INFORMATIVE SEGMENT OF FOX NEWS-- THE COMMERCIALS.
