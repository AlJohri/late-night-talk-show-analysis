Stephen: WHOO! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"] THAT'S IT. CRISP, CLEAN, HIT THEIR MARK RIGHT AWAY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WITH AN OPEN LIKE THAT, WITH THAT KIND OF CHANTING, CRISP, CLEAN...THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I WILL TRY TO LIVE UP TO THE ADULATION YOU JUST GAVE ME. NATION, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN ONE BIG NATIONAL DISGRACE. FIRST IT WAS THE EMBARRASSING MOM JEANS. THEN THERE WAS THE EMBARRASSING MOM BLOUSE AND THE EMBARRASSING MOM HAIRDO. THEN THERE WAS THE EMBARRASSING REALIZATION THAT I WAS LOOKING AT A PHOTO OF MY MOM. [LAUGHTER] THANKS A LOT, OBAMA. FOLKS, HIS BIGGEST BLUNDER YET CAME AT A RECENT VISIT TO  A WASHINGTON CHIPOTLE.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PICTURE. SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT?
OH, YEAH.
HE ACTUALLY REACHED OVER THE SNEEZE GUARD.
HE REACHED OVER THE SNEEZE GUARD. THAT'S JUST NOT COOL.
Stephen: IT'S MORE THAN JUST NOT COOL. THIS PROVES THAT OBAMA CARES NOTHING ABOUT BORDER SECURITY. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] AND ADDING INSULT TO GUACAMOLE, WHICH I BELIEVE IS 75 CENTS EXTRA, JUST LOOK AT WHAT OBAMA WAS POINTING AT. THE MILD SALSA. THAT SENDS A SIGNAL TO OUR ENEMIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT OUR PRESIDENT IS WEAK. RONALD WILSON REAGAN COULD CHUG AN ENTIRE BOTTLE OF HABANERO AND TWO HOURS LATER HE'D BE WHISTLING THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER OUT OF HIS FLAMING BUNGHOLE. LONG MAY IT WAVE. AND WE WERE SO CLOSE TO HAVING A TRUE COMMANDER-IN-BEEF. JUST LOOK AT THIS 2012 PHOTO OF MITT ROMNEY ORDERING AT A CHIPOTLE. THAT'S HOW YOU ORDER HYGIENICALLY, FOLKS, POLITE DISTANCE, HANDS IN POCKETS, WEARING A CONDOM, ONE IMAGINES. I ONLY BRING THIS UP BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN DREAM. WHEN MY GREAT, GREAT GRANDFATHER BRAVED THE ATLANTIC CROSSING, HE CAME HERE WITH THE HOPE HIS NEW COUNTRY WOULD NEVER BE RUINED BY A BUNCH OF FILTHY IMMIGRANTS. SADLY ONCE AGAIN AMERICA IS AWASH IN UNWASHED MASSES. THIS TIME THEY'RE POURING ACROSS THE LONG, SKINNY OCEAN TO OUR SOUTH, THE RIO GRANDE.
IN THE SOUTHWEST, A DEEPENING CRISIS TONIGHT INVOLVING THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN FROM CENTRAL AMERICA WHO HAVE BEEN CROSSING INTO THIS COUNTRY ALONE.
MANY WERE HOPING TO MEET UP WITH PARENTS AFTER FLEEING VIOLENCE, POVERTY AND GANGS.
PACKED INTO HOLDING CELLS, SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR WITH THESE THERMAL BLANKETS, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FOOD, NOT ENOUGH BEDS, NOT ENOUGH BATHROOMS.
SO SAD TO SEE THOSE KIDS IN THEIR TINFOIL POUCHES, NOT EVEN A CLOVE OF GARLIC TO SEASON THEM. AND THE NUMBERS, THE NUMBERS, FOLKS, ARE SHOCKING. SO FAR MORE THAN 47,000 MIGRANT KIDS HAVE ENTERED THE COUNTRY AND HAVE BEEN CAUGHT SINCE OCTOBER 1st. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU STACK 47,000 KIDS END-TO-END, YOU COULD PROBABLY GET A JOB IN THAT HOLDING FACILITY. IT'S AN INCREDIBLY, INCREDIBLY TOUGH SITUATION FOR THE EMPLOYEES.
THE CHILDREN ACTUALLY REJECTED THEIR BREAKFAST BURRITOS BECAUSE THEY WERE MADE OF FLOUR TORTILLAS AND PEOPLE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THEY ACTUALLY EAT CORN TORTILLAS
Stephen: DO YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT NOT ALL HISPANICS EAT FLOUR TORTILLAS? NEXT YOU'LL TELL ME MEXICANS DON'T EAT WAFFLE TACOS. AND WAIT, WAIT, FOLKS. WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR WHAT THEY CLAIM IS THE REASON THAT ALL THIS IS HAPPENING.
THEY'RE PRIMARILY FROM THREE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, HONDURAS, GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR.
THE RUMOR IS OUT ACROSS CENTRAL AMERICA ABOUT THESE SO-CALLED "PERMISOS," PERMISSION TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES. SOMEBODY SAID THEY ARE GIVING PERMITS FOR PEOPLE TO STAY HERE.
THE RUMOR MILL IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES IS SAYING THAT ONCE YOU GET HERE, IF YOU'RE AN UNACCOMPANIED MINOR, YOU CAN STAY.
Stephen: PARENTS ARE JUST DROPPING KIDS OFF AND THEN DISAPPEARING? PLEASE, TEXAS IS NOT THE BALL PIT AT IKEA. AND I DON'T BUY IT, FOLKS. I DON'T BUY IT. AND DON'T YOU BUY IT EITHER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SINCE THAT EXPLANATION, HOWEVER TRAGIC IT MAY BE, THIS LEAVES TOO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. AND THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO UNANSWER THEM THAN I IN STEPHEN COLBERT'S "BAT [BLEEPED] SERIOUS." [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, LONG-TIME VIEWERS KNOW THAT IN "BAT [BLEEPED] SERIOUS," I PEEL BACK THE VEIL TO EXPOSE HIDDEN TRUTHS THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW. FOR INSTANCE, DID YOU KNOW THE FLUORIDE THE GOVERNMENT PUTS IN OUR WATER ISN'T EVEN TO CONTROL OUR MINDS? IT'S TO STRENGTHEN OUR TEETH. THAT WAY WE WON'T GET FILLINGS AND THE REBEL UNDERGROUND CAN'T BROADCAST TRUTH DIRECTLY INTO OUR SKULLS. [LAUGHTER] NOW, FOLKS, THESE KIDS SAY THEY'RE COMING HERE TO ESCAPE POVERTY AND VIOLENCE, BUT MY CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUES AND I KNOW THAT THE MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THE ONE WE LIKE MORE. JUST FOLLOW TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY AS HE PUTS HIS HEAD UP HIS OWN RABBIT HOLE. THEY EITHER HAVE AN INCREDIBLY INEPT ADMINISTRATION OR THEY'RE IN ON THIS SOMEHOW OR OTHER. I HATE TO BE CONSPIRATORIAL, BUT HOW DO YOU MOVE THAT MANY PEOPLE FROM CENTRAL AMERICA ACROSS MEXICO AND THEN INTO THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT THEIR BEING A FAIRLY COORDINATED EFFORT.
I HATE TO BE CONSPIRATORIAL, TOO  BUT THINK ABOUT IT. THOUSANDS OF KIDS STREAMING UP FROM CENTRAL AMERICA ACROSS OUR BORDER. OBAMA. IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. OKAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NEED MORE PROOF? I'M OUT. BUT WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR TUCKER CARLSON?
CAN WE BE HONEST AND SAY THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN OFFICE, I WOULD EVEN SAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO LOOK AT IMMIGRANTS LIKE THIS COMING HERE ILLEGALLY AS POTENTIAL VOTERS, THAT THIS DOES CHANGE THE ELECTORAL BALANCE OF THE COUNTRY AND MAYBE THEY SEE THIS AS A GOOD THING.
Stephen: YES. OBAMA'S ORGANIZING BUS TRIPS FROM TEGUCIGALPA SO THESE KIDS CAN GROW UP IN AMERICA AND BECOME CITIZENS THROUGH SOME FUTURE SOMEHOW PASSABLE IMMIGRATION BILL, ALL SO THEY CAN VOTE AND DELIVER OBAMA HIS FIFTH TERM IN 2024. IT COULD HAPPEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WRITE THAT DOWN. SO JUST TO RECAP: THE PRESIDENT IS KIDNAPPING THOUSANDS OF CENTRAL AMERICAN CHILDREN TO TAKE THEM TO THE U.S. TO SWELL VOTER ROLLS AND SINGLE HANDEDLY DESTROY OUR FLOUR TORTILLA INDUSTRY. HERE TO CONFIRM ALL OF MY SUSPICIONS IS SOUTHWEST CORRESPONDENT FOR NPR JOHN BURNETT. JOHN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. YOU HEARD EVERYTHING. YOU HEARD ME CRACK THIS ONE WIDE OPEN. WHY IS OBAMA DOING THIS? WHY DID HE PUT THIS POLICY IN PLACE THAT WE CAN'T SHIP THESE KIDS BACK?
LET ME SHARE ONE STORY. HER NAME IS CARMEN. SHE LIVES IN A HOTEL ROOM IN AUSTIN.   SHE HAS A 15-YEAR-OLD AND AN 11-YEAR-OLD THAT CAME UP FROM EL SALVADOR. HARROWING TRIP. SHE SAID THERE ARE TWO REASONS SHE BROUGHT THEM UP. I THINK HER STORY IS REPRESENTATIVE. ONE, SHE HADN'T HUGGED THEM IN SEVEN YEARS.
Stephen: SHE WAS ALREADY HERE.
SHE WAS ALREADY HERE. SHE HAD BEEN UP HERE SEVEN YEARS.
SHE'S ONE OF THE LOS ILLEGALES.
YES.
Stephen: SO SHE'S A CRIMINAL. SHE BROKE THE LAW AND SHE WANTED HENCHMEN. GO AHEAD. I'M NOT THE MONSTER HERE.
OKAY.
Stephen: I'M NOT THE MONSTER HERE. SO LET ME GET TO THE SECOND REASON. GO AHEAD. SHE WANTED TO HUG HER CHILDREN.
SHE WANTED HER CHILDREN WITH HER. SECONDLY, THEY WERE FACING A HORRIFIC SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR. THEY WERE BEING PREYED ON BY CRIMINAL GANGS. THEY APPROACHED THEM AND SAID, CALL YOUR MOM AND GIVE US $2,500 OR WE'RE GOING TO KILL THE BOYS. THIS IS THE KIND OF CRIMINALITY THAT THESE YOUNGSTERS ARE ESCAPING.
Stephen: WHY IS IT HAPPENING NOW, BECAUSE NEWS FLASH, IT HASN'T BEEN ALL THAT NICE IN THOSE COUNTRIES FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS. IT WAS SO CRAPPY IN GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS AND EL SALVADOR THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HELPED THEM BY FUNDING DEATH SQUADS. THAT WAS BETTER.
WELL, CENTRAL AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN COMING UP FOR A LONG TIME, AND THIS WAVE OF UNACCOMPANIED KIDS, MANY OF THEM ARE TEENAGERS, IS REALLY COMING UP FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS SOME IT'S BEEN PEAKING IN THE LAST --
Stephen: THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. TEENAGERS. WE'RE NOT TALKING -- JUST FOR THE SAKE OF MY PUBLIC IMAGE, LET'S JUST SAY THAT I'M ONLY COMPLAINING ABOUT THE TEENAGERS, BECAUSE NOBODY LIKES TEENAGERS. OKAY. OR LIKE THE BRATTY TWEENS, THOSE GUYS, DADDY, I DON'T WANT TO BE TAKEN AWAY BY THE ARMED REBELS. OKAY. I WANT A NEW COUNTRY. GET ME ONE NOW. AND A PONY. WHY IS OBAMA DOING THIS? WHY DID HE INSTITUTE THIS POLICY? WHY DID HE INSTITUTE THIS POLICY WHERE WE DON'T SEND THE KIDS BACK.
IT'S NOT OBAMA'S POLICY.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
THE POLICY BY WHICH UNACCOMPANIED MINORS ARE BEING DETAINED AT THE BORDER AND DELIVERED TO THEIR RELATIVES IN THE STATES IS UNDER IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT BEGAN UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH AND PREVIOUS REGIMES.
Stephen: OH, MY GOD. [AUDIENCE REACTS] HOW DID OBAMA GET TO BUSH? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] TELL ME NEXT TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NPR CORRESPONDENT JOHN BURNETT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
