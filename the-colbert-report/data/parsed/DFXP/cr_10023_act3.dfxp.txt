Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY MUSICAL GUESTS TONIGHT FIRST BEGAN SPORMING IN 1939, ALMOST AS LONG AGO AS THE ROLLING STONES. PLEASE WELCOME JIMMY CARTER FROM THE BLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MR. CARTER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.
Stephen: WHAT A PLEASURE TO YOU HAVE ON.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Stephen: NOW FOR THE UNINITIATED OUT THERE. ARE YOU ONE OF THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS OF THE BLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA.
THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL ME.
Stephen: OKAY. WHAT YEAR DID YOU GUYS START SINGING TOGETHER?
WELL, NOW LET ME-- THE BLIND BOYS MET UP IN SCHOOL IN 1939. BUT THEY DIDN'T HIT THE ROAD UNTIL 1944.
Stephen: OKAY SO, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN PERFORMING TOGETHER ON THE ROAD SINCE 1944?
THE BLIND BOYS, THAT'S CORRECT.
Stephen: WOW. AND YOU MET--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU MET AT THE ALABAMA INSTITUTE FOR THE NEGRO BLIND. AND YOU SING TRADITIONAL CONTEMPORARY GOSPEL MUSIC AND THE NEW ALBUM IS CALLED.
I'LL FIND A WAY.
Stephen: I'LL FINE A WAY, EXACTLY. NOW HOW OLD OF A MAN ARE YOU?
WELL, I DON'T TELL THAT.
Stephen: REALLY?
I JUST TELL THEM I'M PAST 50. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WELL, LISTEN, IF YOU'VE BEEN-- IF YOU'VE BEEN SINGING ON THE ROAD SINCE 1944. AND YOU LOOK THIS GOOD I WANT TO KNOW HOW ARE YOU KEEPING IT GOING. PLEASE TELL ME IT'S POP TARTS AND BOURBON, WHAT DOW --
WELL, NO, I DRINK A GLASS OF WINE EVERY DAY. AND I EAT GOOD. I LOVE SOUTHERN COOKING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I LOT OF GREAT SINGERS, A LOT OF GREAT SINGERS START OFF IN GOSPEL AND MADE THE TURN INTO POP MUSIC. HOW COME YOU NEVER MADE THE TURN LIKE SAM COOK, YOU KNOW ♪ SHE WAS ONLY 16  ♪.
ONLY 16 ♪ ♪.
I CAN DO THAT TOO.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT. WHEN SAM WAS OFFERED, WHEN HE WAS ASKED TO CROSS OVER, THE BLIND BOYS WERE AT THE SAME STUDIO, THE SAME DAY AND THE SAME TIME. WE WERE ALSO OFFERED A CHANCE TO CROSS OVER BUT WE TURNED IT DOWN.
Stephen: WHY?
WELL, WE WERE DEDICATED TO GOSPEL MUSIC AND WE WERE, WHEN WE STARTED OUT WE SAID WE WEREN'T GOING TO TURN BACK AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR ALL THESE YEARS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AS A BLIND PERSON IS RACISM PARTICULARLY RIDICULOUS TO YOU BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT RACE ANYBODY IS?
WELL, LET ME SAY THIS, NOW. I CAN-- I CAN TELL, I CAN TELL.
Stephen: YOU CAN TELL. ALL RIGHT, LET'S TEST YOU, LET'S TEST YOU. NOBODY TELL HIM. WHAT RACE DO YOU THINK I AM, AND I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT, I ENJOY THE COLUMNS OF RICHARD COHEN.
I'M TO THE GOING TO TELL YOU.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THEN I GUESS I'LL NEVER KNOW. WELL, JIMMY CARTER, WILL YOU PLEASE SING A SONG FOR US WITH THE BLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA.
IF THEY COME OUT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. MR. CARTER, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE ALBUM IS I'LL FIND A WAY, WE'LL BE
