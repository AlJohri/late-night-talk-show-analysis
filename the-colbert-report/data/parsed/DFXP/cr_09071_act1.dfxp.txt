Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL [EAGLE CAW] TONIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS  ALOHA TO ISRAEL. AND MY GUEST JAMES FRANCO IS THE  STAR OF THE NEW MOVIE "OZ, THE  GREAT AND POWERFUL." I'LL NAIL HIM, AND HIS LITTLE  DOG, TOO. [LAUGHTER] QUEEN ELIZABETH HAS BEEN  RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL FOR  WHAT THEY SAY IS A STOMACH BUG. EITHER THAT, OR THERE'S ANOTHER  ROYAL BABY ON THE WAY! THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] RIGHT HERE. RIGHT THERE. GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING, "STEPHEN!"] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'VE GOT  TO GET TO THE NEWS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD-- I  KNOW MY STUDIO AUDIENCE HASN'T  BECAUSE WE KEEP THEM IN A HYPERBARIC CHAMBER BEFORE THE  SHOW-- THERE ARE TWO HUGE,  BREAKING STORIES TONIGHT. FIRST HUGO CHAVEZ VENEZUELAN  STRONGMAN AND FRIEND OF THE SHOW  IS DEAD. REPEAT. HUGO CHAVEZ IS DEAD. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Stephen: I KNOW. OBVIOUSLY THIS LEAVES A HUGE  HOLE IN SOUTH AMERICAN POLITICS  AND AN EVEN BIGGER COLLECTION OF FLAG TRACK SUITS. [LAUGHTER] OUR OTHER BREAKING STORY JON  STEWART HAS ANNOUNCED HE WILL BE  TAKING THE SUMMER OFF FROM "THE DAILY SHOW." [AUDIENCE REACTS] WE WISH HIM ALL THE BEST IN HIS  NEW PROJECT, RULING THE COUNTRY  OF VENEZUELA. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, STAYING ON INTERNATIONAL  POLITICS, IF YOU WATCH THIS  SHOW, YOU KNOW THERE IS NO GREATER FRIEND TO THE STATE OF  ISRAEL THAN YOURS TRULY. CERTAINLY A BETTER FRIEND THAN  BARACK OBAMA, WHO HAS REPEATEDLY  SNUBBED OUR ALLY BY REFUSING TO  VISIT. HE CAN'T KEEP PUTTING IT OFF BY  SAYING, "NEXT YEAR, IN  JERUSALEM" AT HIS ANNUAL PASSOVER SEDER! AND I WON'T EVEN GET INTO  WHAT AN INSULT IT WAS TO THE  JEWISH PEOPLE THAT THE BRISKET WAS DRY. [LAUGHTER] AND NOW, THE GREATEST INSULT OF  ALL.
OBAMA WILL MAKE HIS FIRST  TRIP TO ISRAEL AS PRESIDENT.
THE WHITE HOUSE HASN'T  RELEASED DETAILS OF HIS TRIP BUT  ISRAELI MEDIA SAYS HE'S VISITING THIS SPRING.
Stephen: OH, SO NOW OBAMA  THINKS HE CAN WIPE OUT HIS  SHAMEFUL RECORD OF NEVER VISITING ISRAEL BY VISITING  ISRAEL. [LAUGHTER] IT'S A CHONDA! DON'T FALL FOR IT, MY CHOSEN  BRETHREN, MY HE-BROS. [LAUGHTER] HE DOESN'T GET YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS MAN DOESN'T GET IT. ISRAEL IS A DIVIDED COUNTRY THAT  FEELS BESEIGED BY TERRORISTS,  AND WHOSE POLITICS ARE INCREASINGLY DICTATED BY A  SMALL, HARD-RIGHT MINORITY. OBAMA CAN'T RELATE TO THAT! [LAUGHTER] AND IF YOU NEED MORE PROOF THAT  THE PRESIDENT IS NO FRIEND OF  ISRAEL, JUST DO THE MATH: BACK IN 2007, PRESIDENT BUSH  SUPPORTED ISRAEL WITH $2.3  BILLION IN FOREIGN MILITARY AID. THIS YEAR, PRESIDENT OBAMA  WANTS TO BRING THAT DOWN TO JUST  $3.1 BILLION. [LAUGHTER] I KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING  UP, BUT REMEMBER, IN HEBREW YOU  READ CHARTS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND OUR WORST FEARS ABOUT OBAMA  WERE CONFIRMED WHEN HE APPOINTED  AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FORMER SENATOR AND MAN WHO JUST LEARNED  HIS DOG DIED-- CHUCK HAGEL. [LAUGHTER] HAGEL HAS A HISTORY OF TROUBLING  STATEMENTS. HE ONCE SAID THE JEWY LOBBY  INTIMIDATE DATES A LOT PEOPLE  AND I'M NOT AN ISRAELI SENATOR I'M A UNITED STATES SENATOR.  CLEARLY THIS MAN DOESN'T  UNDERSTAND THAT  WHEN IT COMES TO ISRAEL, THERE  ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN'T  SAY. FOR INSTANCE, IMPLYING THAT  THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU  CAN'T SAY. WHICH THERE AREN'T. YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT  ABOUT ISRAEL, WHICH I WOULD, IF  THERE WAS ANYTHING TO SAY. BUT THERE ISN'T. SO THERE'S NOTHING TO BE SAID. HOW DARE HAGEL SAY IT. NOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S GONNA  MAKE A BIG DILLY-O ABOUT THE  FACT THAT WHILE HE'S OVER THERE, OBAMA IS GOING TO GET ISRAEL'S  HIGHEST CIVILIAN HONOR, THE  "PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF DISTINCTION."  BUT IT'S NOT THAT GREAT, ONCE  YOU EAT THE CHOCOLATE. [LAUGHTER] AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S  SUSPICIOUS OF OBAMA'S  COMMITTMENT TO ISRAEL. SO IS THE PRIME MINISTER  BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. DURING THE 2012 CAMPAIGN,  NETANYAHU ALL BUT ENDORSED  OBAMA'S OPPONENT-- WHAT IS YOUR  NAME? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I KNOW THIS. I KNOW THIS. I KNOW THIS. DON'T TELL ME. MATZ LATKE? BRIS SCHMALTZY? PUTZ SCHMUCKNEY? WHAT, WHATEVER. JIM?
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU  PRETTY MUCH ALIGNED HIMSELF WITH  GOVERNOR ROMNEY.
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU, WHO REALLY THREW HIS  FULL SUPPORT, IT SEEMED AT TIMES BEHIND MITT ROMNEY.
YOU KNOW THEY'VE KNOWN EACH  OTHER SINCE THE 1970S WHEN THEY  WORKED TOGETHER IN A CONSULTING  FIRM.
YOU'VE BEEN A PERSONAL FRIEND  OF MINE AND A STRONG FRIEND  OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL.
Stephen: THAT MIGHT MAKE  OBAMA'S TRIP A LITTLE AWCHWARD! [LAUGHTER] WILL OBAMA'S TRIP BE A SUCCESS? WILL HE INSULT THE PALESTINIANS  BY EATING THE ISRAELI DELICACY  FALAFEL OR WILL HE INSULT THE ISRAELIS BY EATING THE  PALESTINAN DELICACY FALAFEL? [LAUGHTER] HERE TO DISCUSS THE CHOSEN  PEOPLE IS MY CHOSEN GUEST,  PLEASE WELCOME ISRAELI  AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES, MICHAEL OREN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SIT BACK DOWN. OKAY. SIR, -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. GOOD TO SEE YOU. HOW IS ISRAEL?
IT'S GREAT. TERRIFIC.
Stephen: CHOSEN PEOPLE  STILL CHOSEN?
CHOSEN PEOPLE FROM THE BIBLE. THOSE ARE THE JEWS. WE'RE THE CHOSEN ALLY OF THE  UNITED STATES, THE ULTIMATE ALLY  IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THERE'S ONE STATE THERE THAT IS  STABLE, DEMOCRATIC AND TOTALLY  PRO-AMERICAN.
Stephen: SIR, YOU ARE  PREACHING TO THE CHOIR IF  SYNAGOGUES HAD CHOIRS DO. THEY?
SOME DO.
Stephen: GOOD. PREACH AWAY. OBAMA IS COMING WHETHER YOU LIKE  IT OR NOT. AND I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
WE'RE DELIGHTED.
Stephen: NO YOU ARE NOT. WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE TRIP FOR  HIM? WHAT DOES VERY TO GO TO?
HE GOES TO THE MEMORIAL FOR  THE HOLOCAUST. HE'S GOING TO BE GREETED BY THE  PRESIDENT GIVEN THE MEDICAL OF  DISTINCTION YOU TALKED ABOUT. IT'S NOT CHOCOLATE FILLED. HE WILL MEET WITH THE PRIME  MINISTER NETANYAHU. WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMON  CHALLENGES, STEPHEN. IT'S THE SITUATION? SYRIA UNRAVELING, A LOT OF  CHEMICAL WEAPONS THERE. WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET THE  PEACE PROCESS THERE TRYING TO  GET THE PALESTINIANS BACK TO THE TABLE AND OTHER PROBLEMS.
Stephen: NETANYAHU WANTED  THE OTHER GUY. IT'S CLEAR.
NOT TRUE.
Stephen: IT'S CLEAR TO  ANYBODY WITH EYES IN THEIR  SKULL. HE WANTED THE OTHER GUY. MUST BE AWKWARD FOR HIM BECAUSE  OBAMA IS GOING TO SAY YOU ROLLED  THE DICE THE WRONG WAY BIBI?
WE DO NOT. ISRAEL DOES NOT GET INVOLVED IN  INTERNAL POLITICS IN UNITED  STATES.
Stephen: YOU ARE ADORABLE.
NO, IT'S TRUE. I COME FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF  POLARIZE YIETION.
Stephen: YOU COME FROM  ISRAEL.
I MEANT WORKING IN  WASHINGTON, D.C.
Stephen: LIKE KIRK YOU WORK  IN SPACE I'M FROM IOWA.
OKAY. YES, I'M WORKING IN WASHINGTON,  D.C. THERE'S NOT MANY ISSUES ON  WHICH THERE'S TOTAL BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND THE SUPPORT OF THE  UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL IS A  TRY BIPARTISAN ISSUE.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT  HAGGLE. SOME SAID HE WAS NO FRIEND OF  THE STATE OF ISRAEL BECAUSE OF  WHAT HE SAID. ARE THERE THINGS YOU CANNOT SAY  ABOUT ISRAEL INCLUDING THE  QUESTION I'M ASKING YOU RIGHT  NOW? [LAUGHTER]
FIRST OF ALL SECRETARY OF  DEFENSE HAGUE IS A GREAT FRIEND  OF ISRAEL. HE HAS TOTAL SUPPORT FOR OUR  SECURITY AND THE ALIANCE. THIS SAY FREE  COUNTRY OF FREE  SPEECH. WE,, TOO ISRAEL, AS A DEMOCRACY  WE HAVE FREE SPEECH. PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR CRITICISM  AND WE DEFEND OUR POSITIONS.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT EYE  PLAN? WHAT WHEN DO YOU START BOMBING?
HOLD ON --
Stephen: HOLD ON ONE  SECOND. JIMMY TURN OFF THE CAMERAS THIS  IS NATIONAL SECURITY. [LAUGHTER] WHEN DOES THE BOMBING START? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NO COUNTRY HAS A GREATER  INTEREST IN ISRAEL IN RESOLVING  THE IRANIAN THREAT BY DIPLOMATIC  MEANS. WE HAVE THE MOST SKIN IN THE  GAME. I HAVE MY KIDS THERE.
Stephen: YOU GUYS ARE  THERE, RIGHT.
WE'RE RIGHT THERE A SMALL  COUNTRY IN IRAN'S BACKYARD AND  THE IRANIAN LEADERS ARE THREATENING TOLL WIPE US OFF THE  MAP.
Stephen: OBAMA HAS NOT SAID  HE WILL RAIN HELLFIRE ON IRAN.
HE HE HAS SAID HE IS KEEPING  ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE ONE OF  THOSE OPTIONS IS A MILITARY OPTION AND NONE OF THOSE IS  CONTAINMENT WITH AN IRANIAN  NUCLEAR WEAPON.
Stephen: I WANT TO YOU TELL  NETANYAHU WHEN YOU BACK THERE  THAT THE COLBERT NATION IS BEHIND ISRAEL IN THIS ONE AND IF  DO YOU BOMB IRAQ WE'RE RIGHT  BEHIND WITH WITH JUST AS MANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS AS YOU ADMIT TO  HAVING. THANK YOU SOX. AMBASSADOR MICHAEL OREN. ISRAEL AND WASHINGTON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
