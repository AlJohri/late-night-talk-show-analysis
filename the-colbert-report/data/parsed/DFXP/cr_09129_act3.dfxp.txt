Stephen: MY GUEST WAS A  THREE-TERM SENATOR BUT SHE  RETIRED BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING WITH HER LIFE. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR OLYMPIA  SNOWE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HEY, SENATOR SNOWE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: NICE TO HAVE YOU  HERE.
IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: YOU WERE A RARE  CREATURE. YOU WERE A MODERATE REPUBLICAN.
UNBELIEVABLE, ISN'T IT?
Stephen: PLEASE TELL ME THE  SMITHSONIAN HAS GOTTEN A SOOSMLE  OF YOUR D.N.A. FOR FUTURE BREEDING PROGRAMS BECAUSE IT  SEEMS LIKE A RECESSIVE GENE IN  REPUBLICANS-- MODERATE. AND THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT  THEM. WHAT ROLE WAS FOR YOU IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY AFTER OF AS A  MODERATE?
WELL, I BROUGHT DIVERSITY TO  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT.
Stephen: AS A WHITE PERSON  FROM MAINE? ( LAUGHTER )
NO. NO, POLITICAL DIVERSITY.
Stephen: OH, POLITICAL  DIVERSITY, SURE.
POLITICAL DIVERSITY. YES, IT BROADENED THE VIEWS OF  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND TO BE  REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. AND NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS  NOT THE CASE. ALTHOUGH, I THINK THERE ARE MORE  MODERATE REPUBLICANS, YOU KNOW,  THAN PEOPLE REALIZE.
Stephen: ARE THEY IN THE  CLOSET?
NO, THEY--  ( LAUGHTER )  SO TO SPEAK, YES.
Stephen: I'M NOT ONE OF  THEM. I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH THE  DIRECTION THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I KIND OF LIKE IT. STRENGTH, NO COMPROMISE, SCRIJ  LANCE. NOW, YU BOOK IS CALLED,  "FIGHTING FOR COMMON GROUND:   HOW WE CAN FIX THE STALEMATE IN CONGRESS."  --
YOU SAY, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE  NOT GETTING ANYTHING DONE. GETTING? DONE, SELL ME ON IT. ( LAUGHTER )  JOHN BOEHNER JUST SAID HE-- HE  JUST SAID THE JOB OF CONGRESS IS  NOT TO PASS LAWS. THEY SHOULD BE JUDGED BY HOW  MANY LAWS THEY REPEAL. MITCH McCONNELL, LEADER IN THE  SENATE, SAID THEIR NUMBER ONE  PRIORITY WAS TO MAKE OBAMA A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT. NOWHERE IN THAT IS GETTING  SOMETHING DONE MENTIONED.
WELL, THAT'S A PROBLEM. WHICH I DISAGREE WITH THEM ON. BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO SOLVE  PROBLEMS. THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF BEING IN  PUBLIC OFFICE. THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF PUBLIC  SERVICE.
Stephen: NOTE PURPOSE OF  BEING IN PUBLIC OFFICE IS TO  STAY IN M.L.B. OFFICE.
NO.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO  COMPROMISE. YOU HAVE TO COMPROMISE TO PASS  LAWS.
YOU HAVE TO COMPROMISE. YES. I'M A MODERATE REPUBLICAN. I HAVE MY STRONG BELIEFS. I'VE ALWAYS HELD TO MY  PRINCIPLES BUT I APPRECIATE AND  UNDERSTAND OTHER PEOPLE'S HEARTFELT VIEWS ON ISSUES BUT  YOU HAVE TO WORK IT OUT.
Stephen: YOU CAN'T HAVE IT  BOTH WAYS.
YOU CAN'T HAVE 100% OF WHAT  YOU WANT.
Stephen: MADAM,  RESPECTFULLY, YOU CANNOT HAVE IT  BOTH WAYS. YOU CANNOT WORK FOR THE OTHER  SIDE AND RAISE MONEY FOR YOUR  ELECTION. YOU CAN'T SEND OUT AN E-MAIL  THAT SAYS, "HELP! I NEED YOUR MONEY RIGHT AWAY  BECAUSE SOME OF MY OPPONENTS'  IDEAS ARE GOOD, AND I WANT TO HELP THEM PASS LAWS. CHECK HERE TO HELP ME COMPROMISE  MY IDEALS."
WELL, FOR THOSE WHO VIEW IT  THAT WAY, WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'VE GOT IN  WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: TOO MUCH MONEY?
YES, TOO MUCH MONEY. CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM. THAT SHOULD BE A MUST  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: BUT YOU  FILIBUSTERED-- WAIT. THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I  AGREED WITH YOU.
YOU DO?
Stephen: NO I AGREED WITH  YOU WHEN YOU FILIBUSTERED THE  DISCLOSE ACT WHICH WAS GOING TO REVEAL HOW MONEY GETS INTO  SUPERPACS.
FIRST OF ALL, LET ME SAY MY  PROVISION WAS STRUCK DOWN BY THE  SUPREME COURT, CITIZENS UNITED. SO I'VE BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE  AND PROPONENT--
Stephen: YOU DON'T BELIEVE  I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE  A SUPERPAC.
EXACTLY. ( LAUGHTER )  YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Stephen: BUT CORPORATIONS  ARE PEOPLE.
HOW ASK THAT HELP--
Stephen: CORPORATIONS ARE  PEOPLE.
HOW DOES THAT HELP THE  CAMPAIGNS OF TODAY? HAS IT BENEFITTED-- HAS IT  IMPROVED.
THE SUPREME SAID MONEY IS  SPEECH, MADAM.
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY-- THEY  RULED THAT WAY. BUT IT IS REGRETTABLE FOR THE  COUNTRY IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT  IT'S HAD ON ELECTIONS. HAS IT IMPROVED THE OUTCOME?
Stephen: FOR ME IT DID. I RAISED A LOT OF MONEY. OVER $1 MILLION.
TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE  COUNTRY THAT-- UNFORTUNATELY,  THAT WE'VE MOVED IN THAT  DIRECTION.
Stephen: I AGREE. BARACK OBAMA WAS ELECTED. THAT DIDN'T TURN OUT WELL.
NO, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE  CASE IN TERMS OF WE'RE GOING TO  HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS. AND PEOPLE DO GET ELECTED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THOSE WHO  GET ELECTED. AND YOU HAVE TO WORK ON BOTH  SIDES. AND THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY  PURPOSE IN PUBLIC OFFICE.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU LEAVE  THE SENATE THEN? WHY DID YOU LEAVE THE SENATE?
BECAUSE THE POLARIZATION  WASN'T GOING TO DIMINISH AND I  WANTED TO TAKE MY FIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE SENATE. THAT'S MY SPARTAN SIDE OF MY  GREEK HERITAGE. CONTINUE TO FIGHT. NOT LIKE 300. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: 300 DOESN'T TURN  OUT ALL THAT WELL.
NO.
Stephen: SENATOR SNOWE,  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME.
MY PLEASURE.
Stephen: SENATOR OLYMPIA  SNOWE. "FIGHTING FOR COMMON GROUND."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
