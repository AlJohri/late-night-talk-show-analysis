Stephen: TONIGHT, I'M BACK  FROM SUMMER VACATION, OR AM I? THE ANSWER MAY SURPRISE YOU. THEN I BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT. SERIOUSLY, I BETTER KNOW IT. I'M DOING A WHOLE THING ON IT. [LAUGHTER] AND MY GUEST IS TIMOTHY DOLAN,  THE ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK. IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD FOR HIM  TO GET HERE SINCE HE CAN ONLY  MOVE DIAGONALLY. [LAUGHTER] SUNLIGHT REFLECTING OFF A LONDON  SKYSCRAPER HAS BEEN MELTING  CARS. THAT IS SHOCKING. THERE IS SUNLIGHT IN LONDON? [LAUGHTER] THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."  CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY  COMEDY CENTRAL [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
Stephen: HEY, THANK YOU. YEAH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE REPORT,"  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS, THE FIRST THING I WANT TO  DO TONIGHT IS I WANT TO... PLEASE. FOLKS, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT  HERE TO WELCOME BACK MY GOOD  FRIEND JON STEWART OVER AT "THE DAILY SHOW" TONIGHT, COMING BACK  TO THE SEAT AFTER 12 WEEKS NOW. JOHN OLIVER DID A FINE JOB, BUT  AS THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM KNOW,  I FIND IT MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE TO GET NEWS FROM SOMEONE WITH AN  ENGLISH ACCENT. [LAUGHTER] NO OFFENSE. NO OFFENSE. AND, FOLKS, IT'S GREAT TO BE  BACK AFTER MY TWO-WEEK BREAK,  WHICH, BY THE WAY, I DID NOT SPEND LYING AROUND LIKE SOME  UNEMPLOYED GUY, ALTHOUGH I DID  COLLECT UNEMPLOYMENT. [LAUGHTER] NO, NO, NO. I LIKE TO GIVE BACK ON MY  VACATION, THAT'S WHY I DONATED  MY BODY TO SCIENCE BY GOING TO ITALY AND DOING GROUND-BREAKING  RESEARCH IN HOW MANY PLATES OF  BLACK TRUFFLE FETTUCINI THE HUMAN BODY CAN WITHSTAND BEFORE  ORGANS BEGIN TO SHUT DOWN. [LAUGHTER] MY FINDINGS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN  THE "NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF ARE  YOU GOING TO FINISH THAT?." NOW, FOLKS, I DO NOT SPRACKEN ZE  ITALIANO, SO WHILE I WAS  OVERSEAS, I COULDN'T REALLY GET MUCH OUT OF THE NEWS, BUT FROM  WHAT I COULD MAKE OUT, PRESIDENT  OBAMA WANTED TO DROP MILEY CYRUS ON DAMASCUS. [LAUGHTER] WHICH, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,  CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE THAT'S A WAR CRIME. [LAUGHTER] BUT, FOLKS, I HAVE SINCE LEARNED  THAT THE REAL STORY WAS ABOUT  CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA.
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT  NOW KNOWS THAT AT LEAST 1,429  SYRIANS WERE KILLED IN THIS ATTACK, INCLUDING AT LEAST 4THE  4THE -- 426 CHILDREN. THIS IS THE INDISCRIMINATE,  INCONCEIVABLE HORROR OF CHEMICAL  WEAPONS.
Stephen: THE UNITED STATES  HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO ATTACK  SYRIA BECAUSE DICTATOR BASHAR AL-ASSAD IS KILLING HIS OWN  PEOPLE WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS. BEFORE HE WAS JUST KILLING THEM  WITH BULLETS, BUT IF AMERICA  CARED ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE, WE'D BE INVADING CHICAGO. [LAUGHTER] NOW, FOLKS... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THIS STORY... THIS STORY IS  SLOWLY DEVELOPING. WE WILL HAVE MORE ON IT ONE  ASSUMES. [LAUGHTER] BUT FIRST, FOLKS... [LAUGHTER] [ENGINE REVS] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OH, HI. YOU JUST CAUGHT ME PRACTICING MY  FAVORITE PASTIME, MOTORING. I DON'T REALLY GO ANYWHERE. I JUST START THE FUEL-INJECTED  V8 UNDER MY DESK AND BREATH IN  THE FUMES. OF COURSE, WHAT WOULD AMERICAN  MOTORING BE WITHOUT GENERAL  MOTORS, WHICH WAS THE [BLEEPED]. BY THE WAY, THIS IS... THIS IS  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE OFF  YOUR ACTUAL GLASSES. [LAUGHTER] AND PUT ON GOGGLES. WHICH WAS FOUNDED AND THE  SUBJECT OF THE 73rd  INSTALLMENT OF MY 434-PART  SERIES, BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT. TONIGHT MICHIGAN'S 5th, THE  FIGHTIN' 5th. OF COURSE, MICHIGANDERS IDENTIFY  LOCATIONS IN THEIR STATE BY  WHERE IT SITS ON THE MICHIGAN  MITTEN. THE 5th LIES RIGHT HERE IN  WHAT SCIENCE REFERS TO AS THE  THUMB CROTCH. [LAUGHTER] NOW, MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE  5th FROM MICHAEL MOORE'S  1989 COMERY ABOUT FLINT  MICHIGAN, "ROGER & ME," WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY HIS OTHER FAMOUS  FILMS "FAHRENHEIT 9-11 & ME,"  "SICKO & ME" AND "CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY & ME, ME, ME!"  IN ITS HEYDEY, FLINT'S GENERAL  MOTORS PLANT PRODUCED SUCH CLASSIC CARS SUCH AS THE '53  CORVETTE, WHICH NOW SELLS FOR AS  MUCH AS $215,000, OR FOR THE SAME PRICE, YOU CAN NOW BUY  FLINT. OF COURSE, MOST PEOPLE REMEMBER  GENERAL MOTORS FOR ITS POPULAR  MR. GOODWRENCH AD CAMPAIGN. I WONDER WHATEVER HAPPENED TO  THAT GUY. HE HAD SO MUCH PROMISE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YES. HE HAD SO MUCH PROMISE AND SO  LITTLE BODY FAT. [LAUGHTER] WHEN IN THE 5th, BE SURE TO  CHECK OUT LONGWAY PLANETARIUM,  MICHIGAN'S LARGEST STARGAZING FACILITY IF YOU DON'T COULD THE  SKY, AND JUST WHO HAS THE SPARK  PLUG TO REPRESENT THIS DISTRICT? WHY IT'S NONE OTHER THAN  FRESHMAN DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN  DAN KILDEE. I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE  KILDEE IN HIS WASHINGTON OFFICE. CONGRESSMAN KILDEE, THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.

Stephen: THAT'S LIKE  NEPOTISM. DO YOU HEAR STUFF LIKE, I WISH  DALE KILDEE WOULD COME BACK, I  HATE YOU. THAT'S NOT HARD FOR YOU TO HEAR?
I DON'T HEAR THAT VERY OFTEN.
Stephen: OKAY. THEY'RE WHISPERING IT THEN. YOU CLAIM YOU'RE A STAUNCH  SUPPORTER OF THE SECOND  AMENDMENT.
