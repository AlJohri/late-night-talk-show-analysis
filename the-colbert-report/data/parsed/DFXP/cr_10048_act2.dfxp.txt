Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. FOLKS, FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT THEY SAY, THEY SAY NICE GUYS FINISH LAST. BUT IF THAT'S TRUE HOW COME EVERY TIME I LOSE I'M A COMPLETE DICK ABOUT IT. LATELY I'VE BEEN ON A BIT OF A ROLL. LAST YEAR I WON NOT ONE BUT TWO EMMY AWARDS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FULFILLING MY DREAM OF HAVING ONE FOR EACH KIDNEY THEN LAST WEEK I WON THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE AWARD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IT MEANT MORE TO ME THAN ANYTHING BECAUSE IT CAME FROM YOU, THE PEOPLE. ALSO BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE TO BE PRESENT TO WIN. (LAUGHTER) AND LOOK WHAT JUST CAME IN THE MAIL TODAY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BOOM! BEHOLD! BEHOLD, THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN. I AM THEIR CHOSEN ONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I SHALL CHERISH THIS MOMENT FOREVER. AND IT'S GONE. (LAUGHTER)  I'M EMPTY INSIDE. I MEAN WHAT ELSE IS THERE. I MEAN DADDY NEEDS A FIX. IS THERE-- ANYTHING ELSE TO WIN? IS THERE ANY WORD FROM THE NOBEL PEOPLE?  ARE THERE ANY HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE FAIRS I CAN ENTER? ANYTHING?
STEPHEN, YOU ARE UP FOR A GRAMMY.
THAT'S RIGHT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THE GRAMMYS. MY AUDIO BOOK OF AMERICA AGAIN HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR BEST SPOKEN WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I BET IT'S FOR THE WORD CABINET ON PAGE 27. I REALLY NAILED IT. BUT FOLKS, THE COMPETITION IS FIERCE. I'M UP AGAINST A LOT OF GOOD WORD SPOKERS. PETE SEEGER, DAVID SEDARIS, BILLY CRYSTAL, CAROL BURNETT. NATION, I HAVE VOWED TO TRUST THESE ARTISTS WHOSE WORK I GREATLY ADMIRE AND I'M SURPRISED THAT I JUST GOT A LETTER FROM MY LIFELONG HERO AND RECENT ENEMY CAROL BURNETT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SHE WRITES, DEAR STEVE.
SHE KNOWS PART OF MY NAME. (LAUGHTER)
I SAW ON YOUR SHOW THAT YOU ARE GOING TO QUOTE CRUSH ME LIKE A BUG. YOU ARE A REAL CLASS ACT. I AM NEVER SURPRISED WHEN SOMEONE LIKE YOU SUCCEEDS IN SHOW BUSINESS, KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK, BREAK A LEG AND OTHER THINGS. CAROL BURNETT. FOLKS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I GOT TO SAY, I AM SPEECHLESS IT IS SO GREAT WHEN YOUR HEROES LIKE YOUR WORK. I MEAN --
STEPHEN.
CAROL BURNETT? CAROL BURNETT, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
CAROL, CAROL, I JUST GOT YOUR LETTER.
STEPHEN, I DON'T THINK YOU "GOT" MY LETTER AT ALL.
Stephen: OF COURSE I DID, IT'S RIGHT HERE.
STEPHEN, I WASN'T PRAISING YOU, DEAR. I WAS BEING SARCASTIC.
Stephen: HA, HA, HA. GOOD STUFF.
STEPHEN, TELL ME, DO YOU KNOW WHAT SARCASM MEANS?
Stephen: OF COURSE I DO. IT'S LIKE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS I'M SO HUNGRY I COULD EAT A HORSE.
THAT'S HYPERBOLE.
Stephen: TELL THAT TO THE HORSE I ATE. GOOD STUFF.
STEPHEN, LET ME EXPLAIN, SARCASM IS SAYING THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF HOW YOU FEEL TO MAKE A POINT. OKAY, NOW, ALL RIGHT, FOR INSTANCE, RIGHT NOW I COULD SAY AFTER 50 YEARS IN SHOW BUSINESS, RECEIVING 6 EMMIES, 12 PEOPLE'S CHOICE AWARDS, A PEABODY, A KENNEDY CENTER HONOR, THE MARK TWAIN AWARD AND THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM, BEING ON YOUR BASIC CABLE CHAT SHOW IS THE BIGGEST THRILL OF MY CAREER. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT I MEAN THE OPPOSITE.
Stephen: OH. SO IT'S THE SECOND BIGGEST THRILL OF YOUR CAREER.
HOW DO YOU DRESS YOURSELF?
Stephen: CAROL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY WOULDN'T SOMEONE JUST SAY WHAT THEY MEAN? IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR HUMANS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER WITHOUT COUCHING THEIR MESSAGES IN SOME SORT OF BIZARRE PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE EMOTIONAL GAME.
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT, STEPHEN, I AM SO SORRY.
Stephen: YOU ARE?
NO, I WAS BEING SARCASTIC.
Stephen: LIKE THE HORSE.
RIGHT. LOOK, ALL SARCASM ASIDE, STEPHEN, GOOD LUCK AT THE GRAMMYS. AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
Stephen: I HOPE I DO. CAROL BURNETT, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
