Stephen: TONIGHT, A MEDICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE. SO WHATEVER YOU, DON'T DIE IN THE NEXT 10 MINUTES. (LAUGHTER) THEN A NEW WAY TO MAKE YOUR WEDDING MEMORABLE. OFFER YOUR GUESTS BEEF, CHICKEN OR "MAN FLESH." (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST "MEET THE PRESS" HOST CHUCK TODD IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS. I'LL ASK HIM WHEN WE CAN STOP TALKING ABOUT THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS. (LAUGHTER) HELLO KITTY TURNS 40 TODAY. NOW SHE'S AS OLD AS THE MEN WHO LOVE HER. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"!     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ♪♪ (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") HEY! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. LOVELY TO HAVE YOU HERE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH! PLEASE, SIT DOWN, FOLKS. THANKS SO MUCH. I'VE GOT TO TELL YA, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S ON THESE CRISP, FALL DAYS THAT IT'S GOOD TO WARM YOURSELF. WARM YOURSELF BY A ROARING AUDIENCE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, IN HERE OUT THERE AND AROUND THE WORLD FOLKS, YOU'RE HERE ON A VERY SPECIAL NIGHT BECAUSE, TONIGHT, WE'RE BRINGING YOU OUR LIVE ELECTION SHOW... ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE'LL BE DOING IT TOMORROW NIGHT (LAUGHTER) THIS IS PRE-TAPED WHICH IS WHY I CAN SAFELY SAY, I'M GOING TO BE SO (BLEEP) TIRED ON WEDNESDAY. (LAUGHTER) AGAIN, JOIN US TOMORROW FOR OUR LIVE ELECTION SPECIAL. THAT WILL BE AT WHATEVER TIME THE SHOW IS NORMALLY ON, AND THEN ONE HOUR EARLIER IN  PLACES WHERE FARMERS LIVE. (LAUGHTER) AND IT WILL BE A BIG NIGHT 'CUZ, AT THIS POINT, THE CANDIDATES HAVE SAID ALL THAT CAN BE SAID AND WALKED BACK ALL THEY CAN REGRET HAVING SAID. (LAUGHTER) AFTER MONTHS CAMPAIGNING AND A RECORD $4 BILLION SPENT, CANDIDATES NOW FACE THEIR GREATEST CHALLENGE:  GETTING AMERICANS TO PUT ON SOME PANTS. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT TURNOUT. THAT LOOKS COMFORTABLE. THAT LOOKS GOOD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YEAH! YEAH, I KNOW THAT FEELIN'. WE KNOW IN THE ELECTION GAME IT'S ALL ABOUT TURNOUT. IN THE PAST, THEY'VE TRIED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING TO GET OUT THE VOTE -- TV ADS, PHONE BANKS, PAMPHLETTING, BUSING PEOPLE TO THE POLLS, ROBO-CALLS, EVEN "CAT"-CALLS.
HEY, MAMI, DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR POLLING PLACE IS? BECAUSE I CAN THINK OF A GOOD PLACE FOR MY POLE. VOTE SCOTT WALKER, THIS TUESDAY.
Stephen: VERY EFFECTIVE. VERY EFFECTIVE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THE PROBLEM WITH ALL THOSE METHODS IS THAT THEY RELY ON SOMETHING FEW VOTERS STILL HAVE -- A CRAP TO GIVE. (LAUGHTER) WHICH IS WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT A BRAND-NEW GET-OUT-THE-VOTE TACTIC.
VOTE OR ELSE! SOME VOTERS ARE BEING SHAMED INTO CASTING THEIR VOTES. THEY RECEIVED A LETTER TELLING THEM WHETHER 11 OF THEIR FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES HAD VOTED IN THE LAST THREE ELECTIONS.
A POLITICAL GROUP IS TRYING TO SHAME PEOPLE INTO VOTING.
SOME CONSIDER IT A WAY THE SHAME PEOPLE TO THE POLLS.
A FLYER OF SHAME! STEPHEN:  YES, A FLYER OF SHAME! AND THIS TIME IT'S NOT SOMEONE STUCK IN COACH ON UNITED. ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, VOTERS ARE GETTING FLYERS LIKE THIS ONE IN MISSOURI, A SO-CALLED "VOTER REPORT CARD" ASSIGNING LETTER GRADES FOR THEIR AND THEIR NEIGHBOR'S VOTING ATTENDANCE, BY NAME. LOOKY HERE, THE GUY ON THE BOTTOM VOTED ONLY 60% OF THE TIME -- HE GOT A "D." BETTER GET THOSE GRADES UP, MISTER, OR YOU WILL NEVER GET INTO ELECTORAL COLLEGE! THIS IS THE BEST PART -- AFTER THE ELECTION, THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO BE PRINTING UP NEW FLYERS TELLING EVERYONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO VOTED AND WHO DIDN'T. SO, PLEASE, BOW TO THIS EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL AND VOTE TOMORROW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S YOUR SACRED DUTY -- IF YOU AGREE WITH MY POLITICS. (LAUGHTER) IF YOU DON'T I HEAR THEY'VE GOT EBOLA IN THERE -- I WOULDN'T GO. (LAUGHTER) NATION, PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME IF I EVER GET TIRED OF BEING RIGHT. AND I SAY TO THEM, "DOES STEPHEN HAWKING EVER GET TIRED OF BEING THE PRESIDENT OF ENGLAND?" THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERING) FIRST UP, FOLKS, I'VE NEVER LIKED THE SWISS. FIRST OFF, THEIR CHEESE IS A COMPLETE RIP-OFF, BUT NOW THEY'VE REACHED A NEW LOW. BECAUSE LATELY, SOME CUSTOMERS ORDERING COFFEE AT SWISS CAFES HAVE ALSO BEEN SERVED CREAMER POTS WITH PORTRAITS OF ADOLF HITLER ON THEM. (AUDIENCE REACTS) FOLKS, I LIKE MY COFFEE HOW I LIKE MY WOMEN -- WITHOUT HITLER. (LAUGHTER) APPARENTLY, IN SWITZERLAND, (LAUGHTER) APPARENTLY, IN SWITZERLAND, LABELS FROM THE MINI-CREAM CONTAINERS ARE CULT COLLECTIBLES, AND THE HITLER LABELS WERE ACCIDENTALLY PRINTED AS PART OF A SERIES OF COFFEE CREAM CONTAINERS BASED ON VINTAGE CIGAR LABELS. WHICH MEANS, AT ONE TIME, SOMEONE MADE HITLER CIGARS. EVIDENTLY FOR THE CIGAR SMOKER WHO JUST WANTED TO BE HATED  THAT LITTLE BIT EXTRA. (LAUGHTER) SO TONIGHT 'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TO NAZI DAIRY PRODUCTS. (APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THE PEOPLE WHO GOT THESE CREAMERS ARE RIGHT TO BE FUEHRER-IOUS. (LAUGHTER) AS ONE MAN PUT IT, "THIS IS JUST ABSOLUTELY EVIL AND OUTRAGEOUS." I AGREE! IT'S SO NICE TO SEE THE SWISS FINALLY HAVE AN OPINION ON HITLER. (LAUGHTER) A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MAKERS OF CREAMERS APOLOGIZED, SAYING, "I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW THESE LABELS GOT PAST OUR CONTROLS." HOW HARD IS IT TO SPOT HITLER ON YOUR PRODUCT? THIS IS THE WORST DICTATOR-RELATED MANUFACTURING SNAFU SINCE BEN AND JERRY'S RELEASED "IDI A-MINT CHIP." (LAUGHTER) NEXT UP, FOLKS, I AM NOT JUST THE HOST OF THIS SHOW, I AM ALSO HEAD OF MY OWN CORPORATION. AND AS A CORPORATION KINGPIN, I FILED A QUARTERLY REPORT OF RAGE WHEN I HEARD THIS.
ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL C.E.O.s AS PUBLICLY COME OUT OF THE CLOSET. APPLE'S TIM COOK IS THE FIRST FORTUNE 500 C.E.O. TO COME OUT PUBLICLY AS GAY.
STEPHEN:  YES, APPLE C.E.O. TIM COOK HAS COME OUT AS GAY. WHICH MEANS TWO YEARS FROM NOW MICROSOFT'S C.E.O. WILL ALSO COME OUT AS GAY. (LAUGHTER) SO I AM GIVING A WAG OF THE FINGER TO TIM COOK. (APPLAUSE) AS A CORPORATE TITAN, HE SHOULD FOLLOW TRADITION AND HIDE HIS SEXUALITY IN THE CAYMANS. (LAUGHTER) HE CAN VISIT IT ON HOLIDAYS! WORSE, HE FEELS NO REMORSE ABOUT HIS DECISION TO BE BORN GAY. QUOTE, "I'M PROUD TO BE GAY, AND I CONSIDER BEING GAY AMONG THE GREATEST GIFTS GOD HAS GIVEN ME." OF COURSE, GOD GAVE HIM THAT GIFT BECAUSE HE KNEW COOK ALREADY HAD AN IPAD. (LAUGHTER) WELL, FOLKS, IF THE C.E.O. OF APPLE IS GOING TO STAND UP THERE AND DRAMATICALLY UNVEIL HIS GAYNESS, I ONLY HAVE ONE THING TO SAY... BEING GAY LOOKS SO SLEEK AND COOL! (LAUGHTER) I BET IT'S LOADED WITH GREAT FEATURES LIKE AN ULTRA-THIN PROFILE! SO IF YOU'RE WATCHING, TIM COOK, GAY, PLEASE! WAIT. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL WAIT. IN SIX MONTHS, THEY'RE JUST GONNA COME OUT WITH A GAYER VERSION. (APPLAUSE) AND FINALLY, THERE'S AN EXCITING NEW MEDICAL STUDY OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL -- I BELIEVE I'M PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY -- JUST ON THE EDGE OF CHOKING AND SURPRISINGLY, IT WASN'T LINKING POUTINE TO EARLY-ON SET EVERYTHING. JIM?
FREQUENT SEX WITH MANY PARTNERS MIGHT REDUCE A MAN'S RISKS OF DEVELOPING PROSTATE CANCER. THAT ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY. RESEARCHERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTREAL STUDIED OVER 3,200 MEN AND FOUND MEN WHO HAVE SLEPT WITH 20 OR MORE WOMEN HAVE A 28% LOWER RISK OF BEING DIAGNOSED.
STEPHEN:  THAT'S RIGHT, MULTIPLE PARTNERS REDUCE MEN'S CANCER RISK. IT TURNS OUT, THE BACHELOR HAS BEEN AN 9-YEAR P.S.A. FOR PROSTATE HEALTH. (LAUGHTER) RESEARCH FOUND THAT FREQUENT HUMPING, OR AS THEY CALL IT IN MONTREAL "THE CANADIAN MOUNTIE," IS BENEFICIAL. BECAUSE IT REDUCES CARCINOGENIC CRYSTAL-LIKE SUBSTANCES IN THE FLUID OF THE PROSTATE DUE TO A HIGHER FREQUENCY OF EJACULATIONS. SO REMEMBER, FELLAS, YOU WANT TO ORGASM AT A HIGHER FREQUENCY. AHHH! GOD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO CLEARLY, TO MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH, MEN NEED MANY WILLING SEXUAL PARTNERS, OR SOME SORT OF SUBSTITUTE FOR PROSTATE HEALTH, A PROSTATE-TUTE. (LAUGHTER) WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF THE FINGER TO THESE RESEARCHERS WHO REFUSE TO WRITE US MEN A PRESCRIPTION FOR MAN-WHORING. BECAUSE, WHEN ASKED IF THIS MEANT PUBLIC HEALTH, AUTHORITIES SHOULD RECOMMEND MEN SLEEP WITH MANY WOMEN -- RESEARCHERS SAID "WE'RE NOT THERE YET." WELL, I BELIEVE I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF ALL MEN WHEN I SAY -- HOW ABOUT NOW? ARE YOU THERE NOW? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
