["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING]  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [EAGLE CAW] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN!"]
Stephen: IT'S WHERE I'M  PUTTING IT TONIGHT! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT BEGUN  EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. IN HERE, OUT THERE, NATION -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR THAT GREETING. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE, IF  YOU KNOW -- IF YOU WANT THIS  SHOW -- WATCH THIS SHOW ON A DAILY BASIS, YOU KNOW I COULDN'T  DO IT WITHOUT YOU. YOU ARE THE ROCK ON WHICH I  STAND. [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN!"] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT. I WOULD BE NOTHING WITHOUT YOU  EXCEPT RICH AND FAMOUS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, YOU KNOW ON THIS SHOW  EVERY "NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT"  AFTER NIGHT FOR SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS NOW I TRY TO DEFEND THE  MORAL FOR TRES THAT IS AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THESE ARE DARK TIMES FOR  OPPONENTS OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. NOT ONLY IS IT AN ABOMINATION  AGAINST GOD'S LAW, BUT I NEVER  GET INVITED. [LAUGHTER] IT LOOKED LIKE SO MUCH FUN. THEY HAD A BEACH WEDDING AND A  SHRIMP FOUNTAIN. I LOOK GREAT IN BEIGE LINEN. [LAUGHTER] LAST WEEK THE SUPREME COURT  HEARD ARGUMENTS IN TWO DIFFERENT  GAY MARRIAGE CASES, WHICH THEY WON'T RULE ON UNTIL JUNE. WEDDING SEASON! [LAUGHTER] AND YOU KNOW THE SUPREMES LOVE  WEDDINGS. THEY'RE ALREADY IN MATCHING  BRIDESMAID'S DRESSES. IF THEY RULE IN FAVOR OF GAY  MARRIAGE, THEY WILL BE IGNORING  SOUND LEGAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST  IT. LIKE "EWW." [LAUGHTER] AND ALSO THIS ONE: GEORGIA GOP  CHAIRWOMAN SUE EVERHART, WHO  RECENTLY TOLD THE MARIETTA DAILY JOURNAL THAT, QUOTE, "LORD, I'M  GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE OVER  THIS, BUT IT IS NOT NATURAL FOR TWO WOMEN OR TWO MEN TO BE  MARRIED. IF IT WAS NATURAL, THEY WOULD  HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO HAVE A  SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP." [LAUGHTER] [AUDIENCE BOOS] NO, IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE: TWO MEN AND TWO WOMEN  DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO HAVE  SEX. I'VE SEEN VIDEOS ON THE INTERNET  WHERE THEY TRY FOR HOURS AND  HOURS, BUT THEY JUST END UP ALL SWEATY AND EXHAUSTED. [LAUGHTER] IT'S SAD. SAD. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IF THEY CAN'T HAVE A SEXUAL  RELATIONSHIP, WHAT'S IT REALLY  ALL ABOUT? EVERHART KNOWS IT'S NOT ABOUT  MARRIAGE. IT'S NOT ABOUT GAY RIGHTS. IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT GAY PEOPLE. THIS IS ABOUT HETEROSEXUAL  FRAUD. SHE SAYS, "YOU MAY BE AS  STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW, AND YOU  MAY HAVE A FRIEND THAT IS AS STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW. SAY YOU HAD A GREAT JOB WITH THE  GOVERNMENT WHERE YOU HAD THIS  WONDERFUL HEALTH PLAN. I MEAN, WHAT WOULD PROHIBIT YOU  FROM SAYING THAT YOU'RE GAY, AND  Y'ALL GET MARRIED AND STILL LIVE AS SEPARATE, BUT YOU GET ALL THE  BENEFITS? THERE IS NO WAY THAT THIS IS  ABOUT EQUALITY. TO ME, IT'S ALL ABOUT A FREE  RIDE." [LAUGHTER] YES. A FREE RIDE. THIS ENTIRE BATTLE ABOUT  MARRIAGE EQUALITY HAS REALLY  BEEN ABOUT STRAIGHT MEN, TRYING TO GET FREE HEALTHCARE. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING I  KNOW ABOUT STRAIGHT GUYS, IT'S  THAT THEY WILL JUMP AT THE CHANCE FOR THEIR PEERS TO THINK  THEY MIGHT BE GAY. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NO, THEY LOVE IT. THEY LOVE IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, TWO STRAIGHT GUYS  GETTING MARRIED FOR BENEFITS  ISN'T A NEW SCHEME, IT WAS BLOWN WIDE OPEN IN THE EXPLOSIVE  DOCUMENTARY "I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU  CHUCK AND LARRY." [LAUGHTER] I CERTAINLY HOPE MRS. EVERHART  CONTINUES HER IN-DEPTH RESEARCH  TO EXPOSE OTHER SCHEMES, LIKE ADULTS SNEAKING BACK INTO THIRD  GRADE TO GET FREE LUNCH. [LAUGHTER] OR THE EPIDEMIC OF ISRAELI  AGENTS INFILTRATING OUR  VULNERABLE SALON INDUSTRY. [LAUGHTER] STAY VIGILANT. NATION, I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD  THE EXPRESSION "I HATE TO SAY I  TOLD YOU SO."  BECAUSE I LOVE TO SAY I TOLD YOU  SO! AND GUESS WHAT: I TOLD YOU SO. [LAUGHTER] NOW, FOR YEARS, PEOPLE HAVE  LAUGHED AT MY "COLD WAR UPDATE",  SOUNDING THE ALARM AGAINST THE RED MEANCE. [LAUGHTER] SURE RUSSIA MAY HAVE EVOLVED  INTO AN ECONOMIC ALLY FULL OF  BLOODTHIRSTY OLIGARCHS, AND THE CHINESE ARE NOW TRADING  PARTNERS. WE SELL THEM OUR NATIONAL DEBT  IN EXCHANGE FOR  ARTISTICALLY-POSED PRISON  CORPSES. [LAUGHTER] BUT COMMUNISM IS LIKE THE BLOB. AS LONG AS THERE'S ONE LITTLE  PIECE LEFT, IT CAN COME BACK TO  ATTACK AT ANY TIME. AND THAT PIECE OF COMMIE BLOB IS  THIS PIECE OF COMMIE BLOB. JIM? [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
A NEW THREAT FROM NORTH  KOREA. HAS TENSIONS ESCALATING.
THE TENSIONS ARE SOARING YET  AGAIN ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA,  GETTING HOTTER BY THE DAY.
NORTH KOREA STEPS UP ITS  NUCLEAR THREAT.
NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS  SCRAPPED THE ARMISTICE THAT HAS  CREATED NEARLY 60 YEARS OF PEACE WITH SOUTH KOREA.
NOW NORTH KOREA IS DECLARING  IT NULL AND VOID.
Stephen: THE ARMISTICE IS  NULL AND VOID. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT MEANS  WE ARE AT WAR. WHAT? NO, NO. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, JIMMY NOT AFGHANISTAN. THE NEW WAR. ♪ ♪  ♪ WE ARE AT WAR ♪ [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU SEE, THE KOREAN WAR WAS ONLY  "SUSPENDED," AND NOW THE  CEASE-FIRE'S BEEN TORN UP BY KIM, SO KOREAN WAR VETERANS  OFF THE JAZZY, GRANDPA! DUTY CALLS. [LAUGHTER] AND FOLKS, THIS ISN'T SOME WAR  ON TERROR. THIS IS A REAL WAR AGAINST A  NATION WITH AN ARMY, WEARING  UNIFORMS WE RECOGNIZE, AND HATS SO BIG THEY DO YOU BELIEVE  AS -- THEY DOUBLE AS SOUP  TUREENS. THAT IS IF THEY HAD ANY SOUP. AND LED BY A REAL LIVE  TYRANNICAL MADMAN, WHO IS  PROPPING UP HIS REGIME BY  ORDERING HIS DIPLOMATS TO BECOME DRUG DEALERS IN EMBASSIES AROUND  THE WORLD, PROVIDING THEM WITH  "STATE-MANUFACTURED HIGH-QUALITY METH" AND INSTRUCTING THEM "TO  RAISE $300,000" EACH. [LAUGHTER] IT IS JUST LIKE THE GIRL SCOUTS  RAISING MONEY BY SELLING THIN  MINTS, EXCEPT CRYSTAL METH IS LESS ADDICTIVE. [LAUGHTER] NOW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, KIM JONG UN-REASONABLE [LAUGHTER] HAS BEEN PUSHED TO THE BRINK BY  THE LATEST U.N. SANCTIONS  AGAINST HIS COUNTRY. EVIDENTLY, THEY EMBARGOED THE  LAST TWO PRODUCTS YOU COULD SELL  TO NORTH KOREA: NON-SHINY PEBBLES AND BOB SEGER CASSETTES. [LAUGHTER] NOT THAT THE DPRK DOESN'T HAVE  TECHNOLOGY. JUST LOOK AT THIS RECENT PHOTO  OF THE DEAR LEADER WITH NORTH  KOREA'S VERSION OF THE iPAD. [LAUGHTER] NOW HE CAN PLAY MINESWEEPER ON  THE COMPUTER, INSTEAD OF HIS OLD  WAY, BY SENDING PEASANTS INTO A  FIELD. [LAUGHTER] MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOLKS. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE KIM JONG UN  IS DETERMINED TO STRIKE WITHIN  THE UNITED STATES.
THE FIERY RHETORIC COMING  FROM THE NORTH, KOREA'S YOUNG  LEADER HAS BEEN PICKING UP SPEED IN RECENT WEEKS. IT'S NOT JUST SEOUL IN THE  CROSSHAIRS. PYONGYANG SAYS IT IS TARGETING  U.S. CITIES INCLUDING AUSTIN,  TEXAS.
Stephen: YES, AUSTIN, TEXAS. NO SURPRISE-- KIM JONG UN IS A  SWORN ENEMY OF THE SOUTH BY  SOUTHWEST FESTIVAL. [LAUGHTER] I MEAN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAVE MANAGED TO OBTAIN THIS  FOOTAGE.
(TRANSLATED) IT'S JUST GOTTEN  SO COMMERCIAL LATELY. I SAW WILCO PLAY THIS TINY CLUB  IN '95 AND IT WAS AWESOME, BUT  THESE DAYS IT FEELS LIKE THEY'VE SOLD OUT. I SAY LET'S TURN AUSTIN INTO A  DESOLATE WASTELAND LIKE HOUSTON. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: SO, WILL NORTH KOREA  ATTACK AMERICA? OR WILL WE BOMB THEM FORWARD  INTO THE STONE AGE? WHO CAN SAY? HERE TO SAY IS GEORGETOWN  UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR  OF "THE IMPOSSIBLE STATE," VICTOR CHA. MR. CHA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU WROTE THE BOOK ON THE REGIME  HERE IN NORTH KOREA "THE  IMPOSSIBLE STATE."  SHOULD I ACTUALLY BE FRIGHTENED OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN NORTH  KOREA? IS IT LIKE AH HE'S CRAZY OR AHHH  HE'S CRAZY?
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE OF  BOTH. ON THE ONE HAND HE HAS DONE A  LOT OF WEIRD THINGS OVER THE  PAST YEAR THAT LOOK HARMLESS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ARE  DEVELOPING WEAPONS, LONG RANGE  MISSILES, NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TRYING TO DEVELOP A CAPABILITY  TO REACH THE UNITED STATES. THEY CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT NOW BUT  THEY WANT TO DO THAT AND THERE'S  NOTHING STOPPING THEM.
Stephen: WHAT IS THEIR END  GAME? THEY WOULD HAVE TO KNOW WE WOULD  TURN NIGHT A PARKING LOT IF THEY  ATTACKED US? RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: AND IF WE DID,  COULD WE TELL?
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT AND FOR  THAT REASON THEY'VE BEEN  DETERRED FROM STARTING ANOTHER WAR BUT IF THEY HAVE NUCLEAR  WEAPONS THEY CAN DO THINGS LIKE  PROLIFERATE THEM TO OTHERS, SELL THEM LIKE THEY SELL OTHER  WEAPONRY AND COERCE OTHER  NATIONS BY USING THE THREAT OF BEING THE NEWEST NUCLEAR WEAPON  STATE TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.
Stephen: IS THE IDEA THAT  THE UNITED STATES IS THE ENEMY  OF NORTH KOREA IS THAT GENERAL THROUGHOUT THE NORTH KOREAN  POPULATION OR JUST FROM THE  LEADER?
IT'S EVERYBODY. CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT FROM A YOUNG  AGE THE AMERICANS ARE THE ENEMY. THEY ARE TAUGHT TO COUNT TO  COUNT TWO PLUS TWO DEAD  AMERICANS EQUALS FOUR DEAD  AMERICANS. THEY ARE TAUGHT FROM AN EARLY  AGE. THE IDENTITY IS THAT THE UNITED  STATES AND SOUTH KOREA ARE THE  ENEMY.
Stephen: CAN'T CHINESE HELP  US OUT HERE? THEY KNOW IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO  US, THEY'LL NEVER GET THEIR  MONEY BACK. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT IS TRUE AND THE CHINESE  HAVE THE MOST LEVERAGE. THEY ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT  GIVES FOOD AND FUEL AND ANY SORT  OF ASSISTANCE TO NORTH KOREA. THE PROBLEM IS THE NORTH KOREANS  KNOW THIS. THEY KNOW CHINA DOESN'T WANT  NORTH KOREA TO COLLAPSE. THEY KIND OF HAVE CHINA BY THE  YOU KNOW WHATS?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT. WHAT DO THEY HAVE THEM BY.
BY THE CHOPSTICKS, IF YOU  WILL. AND SO FOR THIS REASON -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK  THEY WANT FROM US?
THEY WANT FOOD, THEY WANT  MONEY, THEY WANT ENERGY  ASSISTANCE, ALL OF THINGS THAT WERE PART OF THE PREVIOUS TWO  AGREEMENTS THAT THE UNITED  STATES DID IN 1994.
Stephen: ISN'T THIS LIKE A  KID ACTING UP. SHOULDN'T WE JUST TOUGH LOVE. LET THEM CRY IT OUT. WHAT IS THE WORSE THAT THE COULD  HAPPEN?
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION IS DOING RIGHT  NOW. THEY HAVE SAID WE'RE NOT TALKING  UNTIL THEY BEHAVE BETTER AND IN  THE MEANTIME THEY ARE RAMPING UP THE MILITARY EQUATION ON THE  PENINSULA IN THE HOPES THAT THE  NORTH KOREANS REALIZE IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE RED LINE IS  WE'LL DRAW IT FOR THEM WITH THE  B-2'S AND F-22'S WE'VE BEEN  SENDING.
Stephen: IS THERE ANY  CHANCE WE'RE GOING TO WAR WITH  NORTH KOREA?
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO  WAR.
Stephen: I WOULD SIGN UP IN  A MINUTE I JUST WANT TO KNOW.
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ATTACK  SOUTH KOREA AGAIN IN 1950 --  LIKE THEY DID IN 1950. THIS FELLOW KIM DOESN'T KNOW  WHERE THE EDGE IS. HE PUSHES TO THE EDGE BUT HE  DOESN'T KNOW WHERE IT IS. HE COULD FALL OVER IT AND WE END  UP IN AN INADVERTENT ESCALATION.
Stephen: IF WE GO TO WAR,  WOULD YOU COME BACK AND WATCH ME  PLAY YOUR PREDICTION THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE ONE? [LAUGHTER]
SURE.
Stephen: VICTOR CHA, THE  BOOK IS "THE IMPOSSIBLE STATE."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
