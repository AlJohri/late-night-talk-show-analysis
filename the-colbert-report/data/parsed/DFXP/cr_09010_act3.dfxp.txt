[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE MAYOR OF  NEWARK, NEW JERSEY. I MADE HIM TAKE A CONNECTING  FLIGHT THROUGH CHICAGO. PLEASE WELCOME CORY BOOKER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BOOM! MAYOR BOOKER GOOD TO SEE YOU  AGAIN.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
STEPHEN: GOOD TO SEE YOU  AGAIN.
GREAT TO BE HERE.
Stephen: A WARD YOU MY  COVETED ALPHA DOG OF THE WEEK.
YES.
STEPHEN: FOR RUNNING INTO A  BURNING BUILDING.
YES YOU ALSO PUT ME ON YOUR  LIST OF THREATS TO AMERICA  BECAUSE I WANTED TO EAT AMERICA  BECAUSE OF ITS RACIAL  DELICIOUSNESS.
STEPHEN: THAT WAS A WHILE  AGO. THAT WAS THE NIGHT OBAMA WAS  NOMINATED, YOU SIR, DID LICK  YOUR CHOPS AND SAY THE RACIAL  DELICIOUSNESS.
GLAD I MADE IT FROM A THREAT  TO AN ALPHA DOG.
STEPHEN: YOU'RE WELCOME. MY WORRY IS WHY ARE YOU IN MY  STUDIO? AM I ON FIRE? IS THIS PLACE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE?
IN NEW JERSEY YOU ARE HOT. SO YES, YES.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. WHAT I LOVE BUT GOING IN AND  DOING THOSE CITY SERVICE JOBS. YOU SHOSTLED A DRIVEWAY THAT WAS  COMPLAINING IT SHOWS WE DON'T  NEED BIG GOVERNMENT WE NEED ONE  VERY COMMITTED MAYOR. HOW IS NEWARK?
DOING EXTRAORDINARILY WELL. WE'RE IN THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT PERIOD SINCE THE  1950'S. COMPANIES ARE COMING IN FROM  PANA SONIC MOVING THE  HEADQUARTERS. 1,000 EMPLOYEES, TO THE GLOBAL  HEADQUARTERS TO MANECHEVITZ.
STEPHEN: YOU HAVE THE WORST  WINE ON PLANET EARTH COMING --  MAZEL.
CAN I GET IT TO YOU WHOLESALE  IF YOU WOULD LIKE.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED AT  THE FIRST DEBATE FOR YOUR FRIEND  BARACK OBAMA? WERE YOU TEMPTED TO GO IN THERE  AND FIRE HIM AND CARRY HIM OUT  OF THERE. HIS CAMPAIGN WAS BURNING DOWN  LAST WEEK. I THINK THAT WE IN IN THIS  SLIERMT OF AMERICAN IDOL WE GET  FOCUSED ON FORM AND NOT AS MUCH  ON THE SUBSTANCE. I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT  ON SUBSTANCE.
STEPHEN: AND THAT WHAT  LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT? THERE'S A REASON THE KING WEARS  A CROWN AND NOT A DUST RAG. HE HAS TO HAVE THE RIGHT IDEA  BUT ALSO HAS TO LOOK THE PART.
BEFORE THERE WAS A TV SOME OF  THE GREATEST PRESIDENTS, WE HAD  A GUY IN A WHEELCHAIR -- ONE OF MOST EXTRAORDINARY PRESIDENTS --
STEPHEN: I DON'T BELIEVE  YOU.
I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO IS  GOING TO STAND UP FOR ALL  AMERICANS, VALUE THINGS LIKE  EDUCATION, INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT KNOWS  AMERICA HAS TO CONTINUE TO MOVE  FORWARD ON WHAT MADE AMERICA  GREAT IN THE PAST. THIS IS WHY I BELIEVE BARACK  OBAMA IS THE GUY. DEBATE PERFORMANCE OR NOT I  BELIEVE HE HAS BEEN THE RIGHT  PRESIDENT FOR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
STEPHEN: OKAY. BUT ARE THE DEMOCRATS THE RIGHT  PARTY FOR AMERICA? I ASK -- YOU WERE ON THE  DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE'S  PLATFORM COMMITTEE.
I COCHAIRED THE COMMITTEE.
STEPHEN: YOU COCHAIRED THE  COMMITTEE. WHY WAS THE WORD GOD NOT  INCLUDED IN THE PLATFORM? AND IS THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO  THE CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW. GOD IS STRIKING HIM DOWN?
I KNOW I'M PRAYING I WOULD  SURVIVE THE INTERVIEW. THE REALITY IS RELIGION WAS IN  THERE. FAITH WAS IN THERE. WE HAD A SECTION IN. THERE WE'RE A NATION OF MANY  FAITHS. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM  WHICH ACTUALLY MADE A VERY BIG  SECTION ABOUT US BEING  INCLUSIVE, ABOUT US BEING A FAITH DRIVEN SOCIETY AND  FAVORING FAITH BASED PROGRAMS. IF YOU READ THE DOCUMENT, DON'T  GET CARRIED AWAY IN THE SOUND  BITES. WE LIVE IN A POLITICAL  ENVIRONMENT WHERE SOUND BITES  AND HALF TRUTHS TAKE THE DAY IN  THE SUBSTANCE OF THE MATTER. I WANTED TO SERVE ON THE  COMMITTEE BECAUSE I'M ABOUT  IDEAS. THIS DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM  HAS SOUND IDEAS. I READ THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  PLATFORM. THEY TALKED ABOUT EXPLORING AND  GOING BACK TO THE GOLD STANDARD.
WITHOUT GOLD OUR MONEY IS  WORTHLESS. IF YOU WANT TO PAY FOR A LATTE  AT STARBUCKS BRING YOUR BRICK OF  GOLD AND A NUTMEG GRATER. YOU HAVE AN IDEA. WAYWIRE.COM. WHY ARE YOU A MAYOR ENGAGING IN  ENTREPRENEURSHIP?
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PROBLEM. THE VOICES OF THE AMERICAN  CITIZENS IS NOT PIERCING THE  NOISE OF OWL GARKY OF MEDIA. VIDEO CONTENT IS GOING BIG ON  THE INTERNET.
STEPHEN: NO OFFENSE BUT WE  HAVE THE YOUTUBE.
IT'S INCREDIBLE BUT YOU NEED  TO FIND THE VIDEO CONTENT  IMPORTANT TO YOU AND --
STEPHEN: THEY HAVE A SEARCH  BAR. NO OFFENSE. TOSS THEM I'LL KNOCK THEM DOWN  NOW.
WAY WEAR SAY PLATFORM FOR  PEOPLE WHEN ARE PASSIONATE  ISSUES AND WANT TO DISCOVER  INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUES THEY ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT BUT IT  GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO THE  CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIALOG IN A  WAY THAT ELEGANTLY FITS ON TOP OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA STREAM.
STEPHEN: IT'S VIDEO COMOWN  CASE AND ACTIVISM AT THE SAME  TIME.
VERY GOOD.
STEPHEN: THAT'S ONE OF  THOSE SOUND BITES YOU DON'T  LIKE. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU SOX NEWARK NEW  JERSEY -- THANK YOU SO
