( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MY GUEST TONIGHT DESIGNED AN APP  THAT WILL SHARE PHOTOS BUT ONLY  FOR TEN SECONDS. JUST IN TIME FOR ANTHONY  WEANER'S COMEBACK. PLEASE WELCOME EVAN SPIEGEL AND  BOBBY MURPHY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  EVAN, BOBBY. DID I GET IT RIGHT?
YOU DID  Stephen: BOOM. ALL RIGHT. OKAY, GUYS. YOU CREATED SOMETHING CALLED  SNAPCHAT. AND TELL THE FOLKS WHAT IS  UNIQUE ABOUT SNAPCHAT.
WELL, SNAPCHAT IS A PHOTO AND  VIDEO MESSAGING APPLICATION FOR  I-PHONE AND ANDROID. THE KICKER IS THAT THE PHOTOS  DISAPPEAR IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP  THE COMMUNICATION VERY NATURAL AND HUMAN
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THE  TERM KEEPER. THAT'S INTERNET LINGO. I AM DOWN WITH ALL THE SOCIAL  NETWORKING BUZZ WORD DOT-BIZ. OKAY? OKAY. SO, THIS ALLOWS... THE PHOTOS  DISAPPEAR AFTER TEN SECONDS,  RIGHT?
RIGHT. YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE A SCREEN  SHOT.
Stephen: OKAY. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO INCLUDE  THE OPTION FOR THE PHOTO TO  DISAPPEAR? WHAT ARE THE USERS OF SNAPCHAT  ASHAMED OF? WHY WOULD I EVER WANT A PICTURE  OF THIS TO DISAPPEAR?
WELL, I THINK YOU MAY BE THE  EXCEPTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S EMBRACING  SHAME. YOU'RE EMBRACING SHAME WITH THIS  PRODUCT.
I THINK THE IDEA IS TO CHANGE  THE NOTION OF WHAT A PHOTOGRAPH  IS AND USE IT AS A MEANS OF  COMMUNICATION. AND JUST RECOGNIZING THAT PHOTOS  AND VIDEOS ARE EXTREMELY  SUPPRESSIVE. YOU HAVE A CAMERA ON YOUR SMART  PHONE ALWAYS WITH YOU. WHY NOT USE THAT AS A WAY TO  COMMUNICATE WITH FRIENDS AND  FAMILY
Stephen: BUT YOU CAN DO THAT. THE DISAPPEARING ASPECT IS AN  EFFORT TO KIND OF BRING THE  SERVICE BACK TO NORMAL HUMAN COMMUNICATION WHICH IS EPHEMERAL  AND TRANSIENT.
Stephen: RIGHT. LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.
EXACTLY. Stephen: OKAY. YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST TALKING TO  EACH OTHER AND RELATING. WE'RE HAVING AN EMOTIONAL  EXPERIENCE, YOU KNOW. I CAN SMELL YOU. OR WHATEVER.
YOU SMELL GREAT. YOU'RE YOUNG.
Stephen: AND WE COULD LOSE  THESE CAMERAS AND THAT WOULD BE  HUMAN EXPERIENCE.
TOTALLY  Stephen: SO THIS IS MORE LIKE  THAT?
YES, MORE LIKE THAT. AND IT ALLOWS YOU TO DO THAT  WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE OUTSIDE THE  ROOM OR ACROSS THE WORLD MILES AWAY
Stephen: OKAY. YOU KNOW, IS THIS A SEXT-ING  APP? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE A SCREEN  SHOT AND YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE A  PICTURE WITH ANOTHER CAMERA SO IT'S NOT A GREAT WAY TO SEND  INAPPROPRIATE PHOTOS
Stephen: IS THERE A BETTER  WAY TO SEND INAPPROPRIATE PHOTOS  BECAUSE I DON'T THINK OF ONE. I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO  SEND INAPPROPRIATE PHOTOS THAN  THIS ONE BECAUSE NO OTHER SERVICE EVEN ALLOWS THIS. IS THERE ANYTHING ON YOUR SERVER  OF A PHOTO?   ISN'T IT SOME PLACE?
NOT AFTER IT'S GONE  Stephen: BUT IT HAS TO BE  SENT THROUGH DIFFERENT SERVERS TO GET TO ME. HOW DO ALL THOSE ITERATIONS GET  DELETED?
YOU GO THROUGH AND DELETE  THEM.
A PIECE OF CODE BAITSICALLY. Stephen: A PIECE OF CODE  FOLLOWS IT ALONG THE WAY TEN  SECONDS AFTER IT AND SWEEPS UP AFTER IT. REALLY?
REALLY. Stephen: IT'S A MOP SQUAD. THAT'S FASCINATING. NOW WHAT DID YOU GUYS STUDY IN  COLLEGE?
I WAS A MATHEMATICAL AND  COMPUTATIONAL SCIENTIST.
I WAS A PRODUCT DESIGNER  Stephen: OKAY. IS STARTING AN APP NOW IN  COLLEGE LIKE THE OLD VERSION OF  STARTING A BAND? EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE DOING IT.
I THINK IT IS NOW. THE TRENDY THING TO DO.
Stephen: WHICH ONE OF YOU IS  IS THE CUTE ONE?
I DON'T KNOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HOW MANY SNAPCHATS  ARE GOING ON DAY RIGHT NOW?
OVER 150 MILLION  Stephen: HAVE YOU GUYS MADE A  PROFIT YET? OR DOES THAT DISAPPEAR AFTER TEN  SECONDS TOO?
WE'VE GOT PATIENT INVESTORS  WHO ARE KIND OF WITH US TO THE  END. WE'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO  MONETIZE IN THE MEDIUM- TO  LONG-TERM FUTURE
Stephen: CAN WE TRY IT BEFORE  YOU GO? I HAVE A PHONE RIGHT HERE. WHY DON'T YOU SEND ME ONE AND  I'LL GET IT. OKAY?
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. GOT IT. I GOT IT. THERE YOU GO. THAT IS THE FUNNIEST PHOTO EVER. AND IT'S GONE. GUYS, THANKS SO MUCH. EVAN SPIEGEL AND BOBBY MURPHY. SNAPCHAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
