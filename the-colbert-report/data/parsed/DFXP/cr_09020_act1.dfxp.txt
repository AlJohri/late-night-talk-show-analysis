TIME.
I LOVE YOU.
Jon:  LOVE YOU, BABY.  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) THE REPRESIDENTING OF AMERICA. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] WHO WILL REPLACE OBAMA. [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US. THANK YOU NATION. [CROWD CHANTING] [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  I'VE GOT TO TELL  YOU, WITH AN OVATION LIKE THAT,  YOU MAKE ME ALMOST WISH I STAYED IN THIS RACE. FOLKS OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT, IT  IS MY MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY. AND THE COLBERT REPORT CAN NOW  PROJECT THAT LORNA COLBERT IS 92  YEARS OLD. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOM. OF COURSE THERE IS ONE OTHER  STORY TONIGHT. OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE O2012  ELECTION. EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR IS  PALPABLE AND FOLKS, I CANNOT  WAIT TO PALP IT. TONIGHT WE ARE LIVE. [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  THANK YOU. OKAY, I'M SORRY. JIMMY, CAN WE RETAKE THAT,  PLEASE.
WE CAN'T, WE'RE LIVE.
Stephen:  OH, WE REALLY ARE  LIVE. I THOUGHT I WAS JUST DUPING  THESE. LETS CUT OUT THAT PART WHERE I  CALLED THESE MOUTH BREATHERS  RUDE. NOW LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO OUR  COVERAGE. IT IS 11:33 EASTERN TIME ON  ELECTION NIGHT. AT THIS POINT THE ELECTION TOO  CLOSE TO CALL. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. ROMNEY COULD WIN, OBAMA COULD  WIN, AND THAT'S IT. THOSE TOO. BUT IT COULD BE A VERY LONG  NIGHT AND WE WILL BE LIVE FOR AS  LONG AS IT TAKES, AS LONG AS IT TAKES IS THE NEXT HALF HOUR. YOU GOT TO BE DONE BEFORE THE  ELECTION SPECIAL WHICH IS A  VIDEO OF A GO GETTING NAILED IN THE CROTCH BY A PUMPKIN. THAT WAS CALLED AN OCTOBER  SURPRISE. [LAUGHTER] I'M BEING HANDED A PIECE OF  PAPER, AND IT IS A NAPKIN. THIS IS BLANK. NO WAIT, IT'S, WAIT, IT IS A  TEAR STAINED NAPKIN. THIS IS A NAPKIN SOAKED WITH  LIBERAL TEARS. THAT CAN MEAN ONLY ONE THING. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE  COLBERT REPORT IS READY TO  PROJECT THAT CNN HAS PROJECTED THAT ANIMAL PLANET HAS PREDICTED  THAT THE WINNER OF THE 2012  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS BARACK  OBAMA. [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  YES, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. YES, THANK YOU, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. I DID READ THAT WELL. AMERICA HAS ELECTED ITS FIRST  BLACK PRESIDENT FOR AN HISTORIC  FIRST SECOND TIME. OF COURSE OBAMA, OF COURSE LET'S  REMEMBER, OBAMA IS ONLY HALF  BLACK. IT IS POSSIBLE IN HIS SECOND  TERM HE WILL BE WHITE. AT THIS POINT, I THINK HE OWES  THAT TO US. FRANKLY FOLKS, I'M STUNNED, I  REALLY THOUGHT ROMNEY WOULD WIN. NOW I'LL NEVER GET TO SEE THE  INAUGURAL BALL AND HIS FIRST  DANCE WITH REFALCA. AT LAST, MY LOVE ♪ HAS COME  ALONG ♪  FINE AMERICA, IT'S YOUR FUNERAL. WE TRIED TO WARN YOU ABOUT THIS  GUY. A MULTIMEDIA EMPIRE TELL YOU HE  WAS A MEDIA HATING SOCIAL LOVING  ANTI-WEALTH REDISTRIBUTOR WHO WAS PROBABLY LYING ABOUT HIS  BIRTH PLACE AND HIS RELIGION. WHY DID WE PULL OUR PUNCHES. I TELL YOU WHAT. WE JOB CREATORS ARE NOT GOING TO  TAKE IT. WE ARE GOING GOLFING. JUST LIKE AN AYN RAND AT LAST --  TLAS SHUGGED AND LEAVE YOU ONA  AN ISLAND WHERE ONLY YOU CAN LIVE, MANHATTAN. NOW THINK ABOUT THIS. JUST THINK THIS THROUGH, FOLKS. NOW OBAMACARE IS HERE TO STAY. CHEER CHEER. SO A SINGLE ILLNESS WON'T WIPE  OUT YOUR LIFE'S SAVINGS. BUT AT WHAT COST? [LAUGHTER] A LOWER ONE. [LAUGHTER] AND NOW YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR  HOURS IN LINE FOR MEDICAL SCARE  INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY NOT GETTING ANY. OH AND YOU THINK YOU OWN YOUR  HOUSE, MISTER. THINK AGAIN. EVERYTHING BELONGS TO THE  VILLAGE NOW. WHEN YOU GET HOME TONIGHT, IT  WILL BE CONVERTED INTO A LESBIAN  FOOD CO-OP. AND GUESS WHAT, IT'S YOUR TURN  TO PACK THE TURNIPS AND I DON'T  MEAN STARCHY TUBERS. THERE IS A SMATTERING OF OBAMA  SUPPORTERS HERE TONIGHT, RIGHT. [CROWD CHEERING] NO, GO AHEAD, ENJOY YOURSELVES. BECAUSE FOLKS, YOU BOUGHT IT. YOU BOUGHT THE LIE. HOOK, LINE AND SINGER. AMERICA'S A QUICK DRUNK AND AN  EASY LAY. APPARENTLY WE HAVE TO SHOW UP IN  A NICE SUIT GIVE FREE HEALTHCARE  SAVE THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND KILL BIN LADEN AND THAT OLD GIRL WILL  PUT OUT. SURE, NO, SURE, SURE FOLKS. SEE MY PROTESTS FIRST, MAKE SOME  FAINT NOISES ABOUT DEFENDING THE  CONSTITUTION. BUT WHIP OUT YOUR WARFARE AND  HERE COME THE SKIRTS. WILL AMERICA RESPECT HERSELF IN  THE MOMENT. YOU COULD HAVE GONE WITH THAT  NICE ROMNEY BOY. [LAUGHTER] WHAT WAS HIS NAME? MITT. NO THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT, MITT'S  NOT A NAME. [LAUGHTER] REMEMBER, REMEMBER HOW STIFF AND  AWKWARD HE WAS WHEN HE CAME  ACOURTING. HE WAS SO SWEET. A GOOD MAN, A SOBER MAN. A MAN WHO SHARED YOUR BELIEFS OR  ANY OTHER BELIEF. [LAUGHTER] AND HE OFFERED YOU, HE OFFERED  YOU EVERYTHING A GIRL COULD  WANT. MILITARY BUILD-UP, OIL DRILLING  ON NATIONAL PARKS, A MASSIVE  ACROSS THE BOARD TAX CUT. BUT NO, YOU HAD TO SUFFER RIGHT  AT THE OCEAN. SO HAVE YOUR FUN TONIGHT, BUT  TOMORROW MORNING, YOU'LL WAKE UP  AND YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE THAT WALK OF SHAME. WEAR NOTHING BUT OBAMA OWN  T-SHIRT AND YOU'RE IN FRANCHISE  NEW -- [CROWD CHEERING] BECAUSE ON YOUR WAY HOME, YOU'LL  PASS MITT'S HOUSE BECAUSE  THERE'S PROBABLY ONE IN YOUR  TOWN. HE'S GOT A LOT OF HOUSES. [LAUGHTER] AND THEN YOU'LL REALIZE YOU MADE  A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. THEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE. YOU HAD THE CHANCE AND YOU  REJECTED HIM. AND YOU NOW MITT ROMNEY WILL  NEVER WANT YOUR VOTE AGAIN. [CROWD CHEERING] AT LEAST FOR A FEW YEARS. ROMNEY 16, THINK ABOUT IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
