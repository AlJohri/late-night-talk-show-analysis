BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST  TONIGHT HOSTS A SHOW ON  PUBLIC RADIO AS A TRIBUTE  I'LL BE CALLING THIS ONE IN, PLEASE WELCOME BRIAN LEHRER. (APPLAUSE)  PLAUS.
Stephen: BRIAN, HEY, NICE  TO MEET YOU, THANKS FOR COMING  ON. LISTEN, I'M A LONG-TIME FAN,  FIRST TIME HOSTER. THANKS FOR COMING ON, FOR  THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO  PERHAPS DO NOT GET THE RADIO IN NEW YORK, YOU ARE THE  HOST OF BRIAN LEHRER SHOW  NEAR AT WNYC HERE IN NEW  YORK. I THINK THE FINEST LOCAL  NEWS IN NEW YORK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BECAUSE I GENERALLY DON'T  DO LOCAL NEWS.
NO COMPETITION, THAT'S  GOOD.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. NOW BRIAN, WE HAVE A NEW  MAYOR IN NEW YORK CITY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BILL DE BLASIO. AND AS A WEALTHY NEW YORKER,  I AM TERRIFIED THIS GUY RAN  ON TAX GEIGS LIKE ME. DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO  HAPPEN?
WELL, IF YOU MAKE MORE  THAN $500,000-- .
Stephen: OH, YEAH, YEAH,  OH YEAH!
WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE TO  DISCLOSE YOUR ENTIRE 1040.
Stephen: OH I WON'T.
HE WANTS LESS THAN 1%  MORE THAN YOU PAY IN TAXES  RIGHT NOW SO THAT-- .
Stephen: WHAT?
EVERY FOUR-YEAR-OLD CAN  GO TO PREK IN NEW YORK CITY.
Stephen: WHY SHOULD I  GIVE MY--   (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHY SHOULD I BE  GIVING UP 1% OF MY INCOME SO  SOME STUPID KID CAN GO TO  PREK. THEY CAN'T EVEN READ YET,  WHY ARE THEY GOING TO  SCHOOL.
YOU HAVE A POINT ABOUT  THE FAILED TODDLER PROBLEM. WE SHOULD GIVE UP O ON MORE  FOUR-YEAR-OLDS.
Stephen: AT A CERTAIN  POINT, YOU HAVE TO JUST YOU  KNOW, NOT THROW GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD. (LAUGHTER)
NEVERTHELESS, IT LOOKS  LIKE 'S GOING TO GIVE IT A  SHOT.
Stephen: SO DO YOU THINK  THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING  HAPPEN? I KNOW THAT IS WHAT HE WANTS  TO DO. BUT DOES HE HAVE THE VOTES  IN THE CITY COUNCIL EL TO DO  IT.
YOU HAVE TO GET VOTES  FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE. WHICH IS THE WEIRD THING  ABOUT NEW YORK, THAT THE  STATE GETS TO DECIDE WHETHER  THE CITY RAISES TAXES ONLY ON CITY RESIDENTS. THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD THING  FOR HIM TO FIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY, BUT IS HE  GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET IT?
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET  IT I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: JUST MAKE  TELEPHONE UP.
YES.
Stephen: YES. OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. WHY DID NEW YORK GO FOR SUCH  A PINKO LIKE DE BLASIO? I MEAN THE ONLY REASON HE  WON IS BECAUSE OF HIS  IMPOSSIBLEABLY COOL LOOKING  KIDS, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
HE'S GOT VERY COOL  LOOKING KIDS.
Stephen: YEAH.
BUT HE ALSO TAPPED INTO A  CERTAIN UNHAPPINESS AND  ANXIETY IN NEW YORK. IN MANY WAYS MICHAEL  BLOOMBERGS HAD BEEN A  FABULOUS MAYOR. HOWEVER, WE'VE GOT A BOOM IN  BILLIONAIRES IN NEW YORK  CITY AND A BOOM IN POOR  PEOPLE. AND BLOOMBERG DIDN'T ALWAYS  SEEM TO FEEL THE POOR  PEOPLE'S PAIN. AND SO THE TIME WAS RIPE FOR  SOMEBODY LIKE DE BLASIO TO  COME ALONG AND RUN ON  INEQUALITY.
Stephen: BUT THAT'S CLASS  WARFARE.
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO  CALL IT CLASS WARFARE.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE  TO. BUT I'M WILLING TO. (LAUGHTER)   ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE WELCOME TO.
IT'S GENEROUS. MAYBE WE'LL V YOU KNOW,  CLASSES THAT ARE A LITTLE  CLOSER TOGETHER AND THEN  THERE WON'T BE A REASON FOR  WAR.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. BUT, ARE YOU A RICH GUY?
NO.
Stephen: I ENVY YOU. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE DE BLASIO MADE GUYS  LIKE ME SEEM LIKE BAD GUYS  FOR NOT WANTING TO SUPPORT POOR PEOPLE. BECAUSE SUDDENLY BECAUSE I  DON'T WANT THERE TO BE  PUBLIC HOUSING ANY MORE. OR I DON'T WANT CHILDREN TO  GET EDUCATION, I'M A BAD  GUY. THAT SOUR BEAUTIFUL CITY  RIGHT NOW THAT SOUR BIG  BEAUTIFUL CITY, A LIVE SHOT  RIGHT NOW, BEAUTIFUL CITY. AND HE IS GOING TO TURN THAT  INTO PUBLIC HOUSING, YOU  REALIZE.
NO, NO.
Stephen: HE IS GOING TO,  IT, THE WHOLE THING WILL  HAVE LAUNDRY HANGING FROM  IT.
IT'S PROBABLY WORTH  MENTIONING IT THAT MOST OF  THE RICH PEOPLE IN NEW YORK VOTED FOR DE BLASIO. HE WON LIKE EVERY  DEMOGRAPHIC.
Stephen: WHAT? WELL, THAT IS TRUE, DE  BLASIO GOT 73%, LHOTA WAS 24,  WHICH WAS NOT A PERCENT, I THINK IT WAS JUST 24 VOTES.
I THINK. THERE WILL BE NO RECOULDN'T  IN THIS ELECTION.
Stephen: WHY DID LHOTA DO  SO POORLY,WHY COULDN'T HE  TAP INTO ANYTHING. BECAUSE BLOOMBERG WAS  ESSENTIALLY A REPUBLICAN. WHY COULDN'T YOU FOLLOW UP  WITH ANOTHER REPUBLICAN?
WELL, HE TRIED. HE DIDN'T HAVE THE WINNING  PERSONALITY. HE DIDN'T HAVE THE KIDS. HE DIDN'T HAVE THE MESSAGE,  APPARENTLY, THAT WAS RIGHT  FOR THE TIME.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK  THAT HIS WILLINGNESS TO RUN  OVER KITTENS WITH SUBWAY CARS, BECAUSE THERE WERE  KITTENS ON ITS TRACKS OF THE  SUBWAY AND HE SAID I WOULD NOT STOP THE SUBWAYS TO SAVE  THE LIVES OF KITTENS, WHICH  MIGHT BE THE FIRST TIME A POLITICIAN OF ANY MILLENNIUM  EVER SAID THAT.
IF MAY NOT HAVE WARMED  HIS IMAGE VERY MUCH.
Stephen: OKAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK  BLOOMBERG'S LEGACY IS GOING  TO BE?
BLOOMBERG'S LEGACY,  BESIDES WHAT I SAID BEFORE  ABOUT THE BOOM IF  BILLIONAIRES AND THE BOOM IN POOR PEOPLE AND HIM NOT  QUITE GETTING PEOPLE'S PAIN  IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, IS  ALSO GOING TO BE AS PROBABLY THE GREATEST PUBLIC HEALTH  MAYOR IN THE HISTORY OF  AMERICA.
Stephen: YOU MEAN NANNY  STATE MAYOR.
YOU CAN CALL IT NANNY  STATE MAYOR.
Stephen: I JUST DID.
IF YOU WANT.
Stephen: I JUST Z YOU  MEAN LIKE RAISING THE  SMOKING AGE, NO MORE THAN 16 OUNCE OF A SODA, I DON'T  THINK YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GIVE  CHILDREN LOLLIPOPS ANY MORE.
THE LOLLIPOP BAN HASN'T  BEEN PROPOSED AS FAR AS I  KNOW.
Stephen: BECAUSE HE GOT  RESISTANCE FROM THE LOLLIPOP  GUILD. YEAH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW WHAT ABOUT RIGHT ACROSS  THE RIVER, RIGHT OVER THERE,  RIGHT O CROSS THE RIVER IN NEW JERSEY, CHRIS CHRISTIE  WON IN A BLUE STATE, WHY DE  WIN IN A BLUE STATE, WAS IT JUST HIS RESPONSE TO SANDY  OR SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT  CHRIS CHRISTIE THAT APPEALS  TO PEOPLE. BECAUSE THEY HAD A REALLY  STRONG CANDIDATE AGAINST  HIM. THEY HAD THE LADY WITH THE  HAIR AND THE FACE WHAT WAS  HER NAME?
BARBARA BUENO, SHE WAS  LEFT TO RUN AGAINST CHRISTIE  WHEN SOME OF THE BETTER KNOWN DEMOCRATS WOULDN'T  DARE TAKE HIM ON IN NEW  JERSEY. AND YOU KNOW, CHRISTIE IS  ONE OF THOSE RARE  POLITICIANS WHO YOU CAN  DISAGREE WITH ALMOST EVERYTHING HE STANDS FOR AND  STILL LOVE THE GUY.
Stephen: VOTERS IN NEW  JERSEY DON'T AGREE WITH HIS  POLICIES BUT VOTED FOR HIM  OVERWHELMINGLY. THEY THINK THAT HE DOESN'T  MEAN WHAT SAYS.
THEY THINK THAT HE MEANS  WHAT HE SAYS, AND SOMEBODY  SAID THE MOST SUCCESSFUL POLITICIANS IN HISTORY ARE  THE ONES THAT ARE BEST AT  FEIGNING SINCERITY.
Stephen: HARD TO FAKE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME, FROM WNYC, BRIAN  LEHRER, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
