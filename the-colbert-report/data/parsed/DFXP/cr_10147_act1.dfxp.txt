Stephen: TONIGHT CAN AMERICA DEFEAT ISIS? AND IF SO WITH CAN WE THEN DEFEAT THE MORE EXTREMIST GROUP WHO FILLS THE VACUUM LEFT BY ISIS. THEN THE FUTURE OF AIR TRAVEL HAS BEEN DELAYED TWO HOURS DUE TO MAINTENANCE. AND MY GUEST RANDALL MUNROE CREATED THE INTERNET COMIC XKCD WHICH IS FOR LOVE, MATH, COSMOLOGY, STATISTICS AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR. SO BASICALLY IT'S GARFIELD. (LAUGHTER) FORMER HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR HAS TAKEN A NEW JOB AT A WALL STREET INVESTMENT BANK. NOW HE CAN FINALLY HAVE SOME INFLUENCE IN CONGRESS.
THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: RIGHT THERE, (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: RIGHT THERE, WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. FOLKS, I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR THAT ENERGY AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE ON THIS QUITE POSSIBLY THE LAST EPISODE OF THE COLBERT REPORT. LISTEN, I PLANNED, I PLANNED-- YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE. I PLANNED ON GOING TILL MID-DECEMBER BUT AMERICA MIGHT NOT LAST THAT LONG. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THE WHOLE DAMN WORLD IS SWIRLING DOWN THE TOILET BOWL, WHICH IS ALSO FULL OF FLAMES. (LAUGHTER) HOW BOTH OF THOSE ARE POSSIBLE, I DON'T KNOW. I'M GOING TO SAY FRACKING. (LAUGHTER) BUT ISIS IS PUTTING ON HORRIFIC MURDER VIDEOS THAT ARE SOUL CRUSHING TO EVEN CONSIDER. AND ITS AT DARK TIMES LIKE THIS THAT WE AMERICANS NEED OUR PRESIDENT TO STEP ON TO THE WORLD STAGE AND DECLARE THAT AMERICA IS GOING TO HUNT DOWN THE BAD GUYS AND GIVE THEM A TASTE OF WHAT GENERAL WASHINGTON USED TO CALL THE OLD WOODEN GROIN BERRIES. (LAUGHTER) YES, HE ALSO HAD WOODEN BALLS. A TRAGIC CHERRY TREE-CHOPPING ACCIDENT AS A CHILD. THAT'S WHY HE AND MARTHA NEVER HAD CHILDREN. (LAUGHTER) WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO.
WHY AREN'T WE DECLARING .
WHY ARE WE NOT DECLARING WAR, PURELY SO WE CAN TAKE THE ACTION NECESSARY TO PROTECT US AT HOME.
JUST LIKE THE ADMINISTRATION, THE PENTAGON IS RELUCTANT TO USE THAT THREE LETTER WORD THAT IS SPELLED W-A-R
YES, WE NEED TO DECLARE WAR ON WHATEVER DOOCY JUST SPELLED.
HEY, THAT SPELLS WAR TOO. BUT LISTEN, TO WHY OBAMA WON'T.
WE DON'T HAVE A STRATEGY YET.
SO WHAT? (LAUGHTER) NO STRATEGY WAS OUR STRATEGY THE LAST TIME WE STARTED A WAR. (LAUGHTER) THERE ARE NO SURPRISE, FOLKS. PROFESSOR PLANS-A-LOT IS ONCE AGAIN OVERTHINKING THIS WHOLE KILLING PEOPLE THING.
THE WHITE HOUSE AIDE IS IMMEDIATELY TELLING ME LOOK, WHAT HE'S SAYING IS IT IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS AND ULTIMATELY HE WANTS TO DESTROY ISIS. IN THE MEANTIME WANTS TO MANAGE THIS THREAT.
TWO-STEPS. I CAN'T WRAP MY BRAIN AROUND SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED AS TWO-STEPS. THAT'S LIKE EXPECTING ME TO SHAKE AND BAKE. I'M HUNGRY. YOU JUST SHAKE AND START EATING RAW CHICKEN. (LAUGHTER) AND EVEN WORSE, EVEN WORSE IS WHAT OBAMA'S TWO-STEPS ARE.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ROLL THEM BACK AND IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME FOR US TO BE ABLE TO FORM THE REGIONAL COALITION THAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED. OUR OBJECTIVE IS CLEAR. AND THAT IS TO DEGRADE AND DESTROY ISIS.
I GET THE DESTROY BUT HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DEGRADE THEM, HACK THEIR NEWS SELFIES FROM I CLOUD? ENOUGH WITH THE TALKIE THINKIE. AFTER PEARL HARBOR DID FDR GO BEFORE CONGRESS AND YAMMER ON ABOUT BUILDING TRUSTS WITH ALLIES AND HOW TOJO WASN'T A TRUE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NOBLE JAPANESE PEOPLE? NO, HE SAID IT WAS A DAY THAT WILL LIVE IN INFAMY AND HE THREW ELEANOR OVER HIS SHOULDER, ROLLED OFF THE LINCOLN BEDROOM YELLING FRANKIE WANTS SOME PANKIE. TAKE CONTROL! TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE, SIR! (APPLAUSE) THIS IS WHAT WE NEED. AND IT IS NO WONDER WITH BEHAVIOR LIKE THIS IT'S NO WONDER PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR A NEW LEADER.
WITH NETANYAHU YOU HAVE A MAN WHO PUTS A COUNTRY BEFORE THE WORLD, WITH OBAMA YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO PUTS THE WORLD BEFORE THE COUNTRY.
WE GET LIKE NETANYAHU OR LIKE PUTIN IN FOR 48 HOURS.
WHERE IS OUR PLAN OF ACTION? GERMANY'S GOT ONE. GERMANY'S ON THE MOVE.
Stephen: YES, THERE IS NOTHING MORE REASSURING THAN THE PHRASE GERMANY'S ON THE MOVE. WHY CAN'T THEY LEAD THE UNITED STATES. (APPLAUSE) BUT THERE MIGHT BE, FOLKS, THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE EVEN BETTER THAN GERMANS TO LEAD AMERICA TO WAR.
IN SHARP CONTRAST TO PRESIDENT OBAMA, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON GETTING TOUGH ON TERRORISM.
I WISH OUR PRESIDENT WAS SHOWING THE SAME LEADERSHIP THAT DAVID CAMERON SHOWED.
THANK GOD FOR DAVID CAMERON. HE ACTUALLY SOUNDED LIKE THE LEADER OF THE WEST.
I LOVE WHAT DAVID CAMERON IS SAYING. AND I WISH OUR PRESIDENT WOULD SAY THE SAME SAME THING.
Stephen: YES, PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON, A NAME SYNONYMOUS WITH-- WAIT, THAT'S NOT TONY BLAIR? WHERE'S TONY BLAIR? (LAUGHTER) LAST FRIDAY CAM HERE GAVE A SPEECH ABOUT ISIS THAT SHOWED HE'S GOT A STIFF UPPER LIP AND EVEN STIFFER LOWER SACK.
MY FIRST PRIORITY AS PRIME MINISTER IS TO MAKE SURE WE DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP OUR PEOPLE SAFE. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS THREAT TO OUR SECURITY IS QUITE CLEAR. IT IS A POISONOUS IDEOLOGY OF ISLAMIST EXTREMISM. WE COULD BE FACING A TERRORIST STATE ON THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN.
THE JOINT TERRORISM ANALYSIS CENTER HAS INCREASED THE THREAT LEVEL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM SUBSTANTIAL TO SEVERE.
THAT'S RIGHT. THEY HAVE RAISED THE TERROR THREAT LEVEL FROM SUBSTANTIAL TO SEVERE WHICH IS JUST ONE STEP AWAY FROM THE U.K.'S HIGHEST LEVEL SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALI--OH -[BLEEP] (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AND THAT IS  NOT-- FOLKS THAT'S NOT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO LEADERS. LOOK AT CAMERON'S SUIT DURING THE SPEECH IT SAYS POWER, DIGNITY, STRENGTH. WHILE OBAMA'S SUIT SAYS I'M A GROOMSMAN IN AN AUGUST WEDDING. (LAUGHTER) BUT EVEN DAVID CAMERON PEALS IN COMPARISON TO THE MAN I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LEAD US, FRANK UNDERWOOD FROM HOUSE OF CARDS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, IF YOU HAVEN'T STOLEN YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND'S NETFLIX PASSWORD YET FRANK UNDERWOOD IS A WASHINGTON POWER PLAYER WHO ROSE TO PROMINENCE THROUGH LYING, SCHEMING, BACKSTABBING AND MURDER. BUT GETS THINGS DONE IN WASHINGTON. IF YOU CAN BUY INTO THAT CRAZY PREMISE, IT IS A REALLY GREAT SHOW. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS SPORTING SERIOUS UNDERWOOD, JIM.
IT DOES SEEM LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS A LITTLE BIT OF FRANK UNDERWOOD ENVY.
WOULD WASHINGTON RUN SMOOTHER IN FRANK UNDERWOOD WAS CALLING THE SHOTS?
Stephen: YES, WASHINGTON WOULD RUN SMOOTHER IF FICTIONAL NETFLIX CHARACTERS WERE IN CHARGE. I MEAN WHO, WHO, WHO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WOULD DARE PICK A FIGHT WITH HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP CRAZY-- CRAZY EYES. (APPLAUSE) GOD, HOW I WISH FRANK UNDERWOOD WERE PRESIDENT. BUT THAT CAN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE HOUSE OF CARDS IS JUST A TV SHOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT STEVEN, I HATE TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS IS ALSO  JUST A TV SHOW.
Stephen: WELL, PRESIDENT FRANCIS UNDERWOOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
PLEASE, STEVEN, I DETEST FORMALITIES. JUST CALL ME PRESIDENT FRANK UNDERWOOD.
Stephen: WELL, IT IS A REAL HONOR TO HAVE YOU HERE, SIR. I'M A HUGE FAN. HOW DO YOU GET SO MUCH DONE?
WELL, IT'S LIKE I ALWAYS SAY, STEPHEN, A DOG DOESN'T NEED TO SHOW ITS TEETH AS LONG AS HIS GROWL IS DEEP ENOUGH. HIS FOOD BOWL IS FULL AND HE KNOWS WHERE ALL THE BONES ARE BURIED. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WOW. I HAVE NO [BLEEP] IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU-- THAT, THAT WAS MENACINGLY HOMESPUN, SIR. I JUST HOPE OBAMA WAS WATCHING.
OH, I'M SURE HE IS, STEPHEN. "THE COLBERT REPORT" IS TREMENDOUSLY INFLUENTIAL. IT'S LIKE A MEET THE PRESS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY WATCH.
Stephen: OH, WELL, SIR, DO YOU WATCH MY SHOW.
NO, I HAVEN'T HAD THE PLEASURE. I'M WAITING FOR THE WHOLE SERIES TO BE OVER AND THEN I'M GOING TO BINGE WATCH FROM EPISODE ONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I MEAN YOU'RE GOING IT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY PRETTY SOON BECAUSE THE SHOW ENDS IN MID-DECEMBER.
AH. WELL, I OFFER YOU MY CONGRATULATIONS AND MY CONDOLENCES. WHAT ARE YOUR FUTURE PLANS?
Stephen: WELL, I HAVEN'T REALLY MADE ANY SPECIFIC PLANS, BUT-- I MEAN YOU HAVE PROVEN THAT A CHARMING SOUTH CAROLINIAN CAN RISE QUICKLY IN WASHINGTON D.C. I MEAN MAYBE I WILL HEAD DOWN THERE.
REALLY?
Stephen: YEAH.
I LIKE THAT IDEA VERY MUCH. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU UNDER MY WING.
Stephen: REALLY, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE THREATENED BY MY AMBITION.
NO, NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT. IN FACT, I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE YOU MY SPECIAL TOUR OF D.C. JUST TAKE THE LAST TRAIN DOWN, I'LL MEET YOU ON THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM.
Stephen: WELL, THAT SOUNDS GREAT. I'LL MEET YOU THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER THE SHOW'S OVER.
IT'S A DATE. AND STEPHEN, FOR REASONS OF SECURITY IF ANYONE ASKS WHERE YOU ARE GOING, JUST SAY TO COMMIT SUICIDE.
Stephen: GOT IT MUM'S THE WORD, THANK YOU, SIR, I'LL SEE YOU THEN, PRESIDENT FRANK UNDERWOOD, EVERYBODY. WE'RE GOING TO BE FRIENDS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
