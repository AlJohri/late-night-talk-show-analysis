Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, PLEASE -- WELCOME --  WELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  IN HERE OUT THERE TO TONIGHT'S INFORMATION UPLINK. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, FOLKS. FOLKS, WHEN I'M RIGHT, I'M  RIGHT. AND WHEN I'M WRONG, I'M OFTEN  RIGHT, TOO. BUT WHEN I'M WRONG AND I'M  WRONG, I'M BIG ENOUGH TO CHANGE  MY OPINION. [ LAUGHTER ] CASE IN POINT, I'M NO FAN OF  THE FRENCH. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, THEY GAVE US THAT STATUE,  BUT IT TURNED GREEN AS SOON AS  WE PUT IT UP. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU  WHAT A MONEY PIT LOUISIANA'S  TURNED OUT TO BE. JEFFERSON SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A  GIFT RECEIPT FOR THAT THING. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE ALWAYS SEEN THE FRENCH AS  TRUFFLE-HUFFING SURRENDER  MONKEYS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT TURNS OUT THEY'RE  ACTUALLY TRUFFLE-HUFFING  SURRENDER MONKEYS WITH FAMILY  VALUES. JIM?
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE OPPOSING SAME SEX  MARRIAGE RALLIED ON THE STREETS OF PARIS TODAY. FRANCE'S PRESIDENT IS PUSHING A  PLAN TO LEGALIZE SAME-SEX  MARRIAGE AND ADOPTIONS. ♪ ♪  ♪ MAMA MIA ♪
Stephen: JUST TO BE CLEAR,  IN FRANCE THE PEOPLE WITH THE  PINK SIGNS DANCING TO ABBA ARE THE ANTI-GAY PROTESTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN IT COMES TO THE SANCTITY OF  MARRIAGE, IT TURNS OUT THE  FRENCH ARE JUST LIKE US! THEY KNOW THAT IT'S ADAM AND EVE  NOT ADAM AND YVES. [ LAUGHTER ] THE FRENCH KNOW THAT GOD  ORDAINED MARRIAGE TO BE BETWEEN  ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN AND THAT MAN'S MISTRESS, WHO IS ALSO THE  WOMAN'S MISTRESS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S VERY TASTEFUL. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S NOT JUST THEIR  OPPOSITION TO GAY MARRIAGE THAT  HAS ME FEELING LESS MISERABLES ABOUT LE FRENCH: IT'S THEIR  NEWFOUND COMMITMENT TO THE WAR  ON TERROR. JIM?
IN MALI, FRANCE STEPPED UP  MILITARY MOVES TO STOP ISLAMIC  FIGHTERS TIED TO AL QAEDA.
FRANCE THIS WEEK DISPATCHED  2500 TROOPS AND COMMENCED AIR  STRIKES.
THE U.S. IS VERY PLEASED THAT  FRANCE IS DOING THIS, I THINK TO  A DEGREE SURPRISED.
Stephen: MAIS OUI, TO A  DEGREE SURPRISED THE US IS. [ LAUGHTER ] UP UNTIL NOW, THE ONLY THING  THAT GOT THE FRENCH ANGRY ENOUGH  TO FIGHT WAS SERVING A BORDELAISE SAUCE WITH FISH. [ LAUGHTER ] FRANCE IS PUTTING THE HURT TO AL  QAEDA IN MALI! WITH PLANES, TROOPS AND ITS MOST  SOPHISTICATED HELICOPTER GUNSHIP  WHICH, IN FRANCE, MEANS A GUNSHIP THAT FIRES MISSILES AT  ITSELF IN A DADAIST COMMENTARY  ON THE CRUEL FARCE THAT IS WAR. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS BOLD -- BOLD MILITARY  ACTION EVEN  SURPRISED THE FRENCH, WHOSE  PRESIDENT, FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, IS PERCEIVED AS SO INDECISIVE AND  WEAK, HE'S EARNED THE NICKNAME  "FLANBY," AFTER A WOBBLY GELATIN  DESSERT. OH, BURN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OR AS THE FRENCH SAY, BRULEE! [ LAUGHTER ] INTERESTINGLY, ONE OF THE  REASONS THAT HOLLANDE IS SO  UNPOPULAR IN THE FIRST PLACE IS THAT HE'S THE ONE PUSHING THE  GAY MARRIAGE INITIATIVE. BUT AS ONE PAPER PUT IT  "MALI COULD TRANSFORM HOLLANDE'S  POLITICAL IMAGE."  THEIR WARS MAKE THEIR LEADERS LOOK TOUGH, JUST LIKE OURS DO! [ LAUGHTER ] FRANCE JUST NEEDS "THEIR" OWN  FRANCE TO CALL PUSSIES-- I'M  GONNA SAY BELGIUM. [ LAUGHTER ] COME ON, BELGIUM. BUNCH OF CHOCOLATE-SLURPING,  MAYONAISE-DIPPING ANTWERPS, WHO  NEED TO BRUSSELS SPROUT A PAIR! [ LAUGHTER ] FRANCE, THOSE ARE ALL FREE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S WORKING FOR HOLLANDE  WITH HIS MALI INTERVENTION  BACKED BY 75% OF THE FRENCH, A SHOCKING NUMBER, SINCE FRENCH  PEOPLE NORMALLY CAN'T AGREE ON  ANYTHING. THAT'S WHY THE SCAFFOLDING FOR  THE EIFFEL TOWER'S BEEN UP SO  LONG. THEY CAN'T DECIDE WHAT TO BUILD! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELL IT IS ABOUT TIME! ABOUT DAMN TIME THE FRENCH ARE  FINALLY JOINING THE WAR ON  TERRORMENT  THEY'RE GONNA GET IN THERE, KICK SOME AL QAEDA BUTT, AND GET  OUT--  MAYBE SOMEDAY.
IF YOU SUBSTITUTE AFGHANISTAN  FOR MALI, IT SOUNDS A HECK OF A  LOT LIKE THE UNITED STATES' OBJECTIVE IN AFGHANISTAN.
IN NORTH MALI YOU HAVE  ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS, YOU HAVE AL  QAEDA, YOU HAVE DRUG  TRAFFICKERS. THIS COULD BECOME ANOTHER  AFGHANISTAN.
THIS COULD BE THE NEXT  AFGHANISTAN.
Stephen: YES, THE PARALLELS  ARE OBVIOUS. IT'S JUST LIKE AFGHANISTAN, IN  THAT I DON'T KNOW WHERE MALI IS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS  NEXT AFGHANISTAN IS THAT IT  WON'T BE OURS! THE USA IS NOWHERE NEAR THIS  THING.
THE US NOW TODAY OFFICIALLY  INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT BEING  WAGED BY FRANCE IN MALI.
US CARGO JETS HAVE FLOWN AT  LEAST FIVE MISSIONS IN MALI THIS  WEEK.
Stephen: SACRE BLEU! [ LAUGHTER ] SO IS FRANCE ABOUT TO GET  THEMSELVES INTO AN  AMERICAN-STYLE QUAGMIRE, OR IS  AMERICA ABOUT TO GET ITSELF IN A FRENCH STYLE MENAGE-A-QUAG? HERE TO TELL ME IS THE DIRECTOR  OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRENCH  STUDIES AT NYU, EDWARD BERENSON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOIN US --  JOINING US. OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, WHO OR WHAT IS  MALI? AND WHY DO THE FRENCH CARE?
MALI IS WHAT.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD.
IT'S IN NORTHWEST AFRICA. IT'S A BIG.
Stephen: HOW BIG COMPARED  TO FRANCE?
UP THERE. IT'S BIG. IT'S BIG.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR  YOUR -- [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRECISION. WHY DOES FRANCE CARE ABOUT MALI?
HERE IS WHY FRANCE CARES. MALI SAY FORMER COLONY OF  FRANCE. RIGHT?
Stephen: OKAY. WAIT, THEY HAD COLONIES?
THEY HAD A TON OF COLONIES.
Stephen: REALLY? THERE WERE COUNTRIES THAT  SURRENDERED TO FRANCE? [ LAUGHTER ]
AND FOR MANY DECADES.
Stephen: NO LONGER  COLONIES.
NO LONGER A COLONIES. THE FRENCH GAVE UP THE COLONIES  AROUND 1960 BUT KEPT THEM ON A  LONGER OR SHORTER LEASH DEPENDING ON WHICH COUNTRY AND  HOW MUCH STUFF THEY HAD. MALI IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PART  OF AFRICA WHERE THERE'S NATURAL  RESOURCES, TONS OF OIL OFFSHORE. A LOT OF THAT OIL GETS DEALT TO  THE FRENCH ON GOOD TERMS. ALGERIA IS A PLACE WHERE THERE'S  ALL KINDS OF STUFF THE FRENCH  WANT AND GET.
Stephen: IS THIS AL QAEDA  IN THERE?
IT'S AL QAEDA.
Stephen: THERE A GUY LIKE  BIN LADEN? IS THERE A NAME I HAVE TO  PEOPLERRIZE AGAIN?
NOT YET AND I HOPE THERE  WON'T BE ANY.
Stephen: MY ABU AND BIN  THIS AND BIN THAT BIN IS KIND OF  FULL RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
THINK OF THESE GROUPS IS A  COMBINATION OF MEXICAN DRUG  ORGANIZATION AND ISLAMIC TERRORIST GROUP. HOW MANY NAMES OF MEXICAN DRUG  LORDS DO YOU KNOW? NOT THAT MANY BUT YOU KNOW THEY  DO BAD THINGS. YOU HAVE NARCO TERRORISM IN A  WAY. IN MALI IT'S A BAD THING.
Stephen: THIS IS GOING TURN  INTO AN AFGHANISTAN FOR FRANCE  OR LIKE A VIETNAM SITUATION WHERE YOU GO IN AND YOU ARE  STUCK THERE?
IT COULD. BUT THE FRENCH HAVE, IN THE PAST  DECADE, GONE TO OTHER PARTS OF  WEST AFRICA BRIEFLY AND GOTTEN OUT QUICKLY. THEY WENT TO THE IVORY COAST IN  2002 AND 2011. THEY WENT IN AND GOT OUT.
Stephen: HOW COME I DIDN'T  KNOW THEY KICKED ASS AND TAKE  NAMES? I KNOW ABOUT THE FREEDOM FRIES. >>? THEY KNOW WHAT IS IN THEIR  BACKYARD AND WHAT ISN'T. THEY DIDN'T THINK IRAQ IS IN  THEIR BACKYARD BUT NORTH AFRICA  IS DEFINITELY THEIR BACKYARD AND THEY ARE WILLING TO GO THERE.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU SAY IN  FRENCH I'M SORRY FRANCE, I  DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE BAD ASS.
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
Stephen: WHAT HE SAID. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME.
