[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, YOU KNOW, WHAT I'M LOOK  LOOK -- WHEN I'M LOOKING FOR  RELATIONSHIP ADVICE I ALWAYS TURN TO TELEEVANGELIST AND GAY  ICON PAT ROBERTSON. I'M IN THE THE ONLY ONE. ON THE 700 CLUB LAST WEEK A  17-YEAR-OLD BOY WROTE IN SAYING  HE NOTICED HOW ALONE HIS MOM FEELS BECAUSE HIS FATHER SPENDS  TOO MUCH TIME AT THE COMPUTER  PLAYING A WAR GAME AND HE WANTS HIS FATHER TO SPEND MORE TIME  WITH HIS MOM. BUT THE SUBTEXT IS MY DAD IS HOG  THE XBOX 360. WHAT I REALLY THINK IS SWEET IS  THE SENSITIVE WAY PAT ROBERTSON  APPROACHED THE DELL IMAIT PROBLEMS OF INTERPERSONAL  RELATIONSHIPS.
IT MAY BE YOUR MOM ISN'T AS  SWEET AS YOU THINK SHE IS. SHE MAY BE HARD NOSED. A WOMAN CAME TO A PREACHER I  KNOW. IT WAS SO FUNNY. SHE WAS ALL OF LOOK. HER HAIR WAS TORN UP AND SHE WAS  OVER WEIGHT AND SHE O REVEREND,  WHAT CAN I DO? MY HUSBAND HAS STARTED TO DRINK. AND THE PREACHER LOOKED AT HER  AND SAID MADAM, IF I WAS MARRIED  TO YOU I WOULD START TO DRINK,  TOO.
O MY --
WE NEED TO CULTIVATE ROMANCE,  DARLING. I'M MARRIED TO HIM SO HE HAS TO  TAKE ME. FIX YOURSELF UP, LOOK PRETTY.
Stephen: LISTEN TO PAT,  LADIES. COME ON, NO, COME ON. YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR MAN'S  ATTENTION YOU STOP BEING SO  SLATTERLY RIGHT AFTER I CHECK A 19th CENTURY DICTIONARY TO  FIND OUT WHAT IT MEANS. LIVE UP TO THE BEAUTY STANDARDS  THAT THIS MAN HAS SEX LOOK AT  THAT EYE CANDY. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, -- THIS MAN HAS SET. JUST LOOK AT THAT EYE CANDY. WELL, I -- EYE PUDDING. [ LAUGHTER ] PAT IS PREACHING FAMILY VALUES  AS JESUS SAID IN THE BIBLE LET  HE WHO IS WITHOUT SIN CAST THE FIRST PHONE AND THAT UGGO OVER  THERE. I MEAN WOOF! IF MRS. CHRIST, CHRISTINE, I  BELIEVE IF SHE WASN'T SO
