Stephen: TONIGHT FOX NEWS UNCOVERS A NEW SCANDAL. ONE OF THEIR SHOWS WASN'T TALKING ABOUT BENGHAZI. (LAUGHTER) THEN MORE EASTERN EUROPEAN CONFLICT. LAST NIGHT MY RUSSIAN DRESSING GOT ON MY CHICKEN KIEV. (LAUGHTER) THEN MY GUEST DAVID REMNICK HAS A NEW COLLECTION OF NEW YORKER PIECES FROM THE 1940s. YOU KNOW, THE ONES YOUR GRANDPARENTS ALWAYS MEANT TO READ BUT DIDN'T. 17% OF AMERICANS SAY THEY WOULD HAVE SEX WITH A ROBOT. THE OTHER 83% ARE LIARS. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, FOLKS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, FOLKS. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, THAT-- THIS CROWD TONIGHT IS AS CRISP AS A NEW STALK OF CELERY. AND THIS IS WHY I WILL NEVER PHONE IT IN, TO THE LAST DROP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING ELSE TONIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY T-MOBILE. (LAUGHTER) T-MOBILE PROUD SPONSOR OF THAT THING I JUST SAID. YOU SEE, I AGREED YEARS AGO THAT EVERY NOW AND THEN I WOULD DO THESE INTEGRATED SPONSORSHIPS ON THE REPORT TO HELP PAY THE PRODUCTION BILLS AND THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS. SO LET'S--  (LAUGHTER) LET'S GET-- LET'S GET TO OUR NUMBER ONE STORY WHICH TONIGHT IS A NUMBER TWO STORY.
DOCTORS BELIEVE THEY'VE COME UP WITH A WAY TO HELP WITH CONSTIPATION. IT INVOLVES A VIBRATING PILL. DOCTORS IN ISRAEL ARE TESTING A NEW PILL THAT SHAKES UP YOUR INTESTINAL AREA AND GETS THINGS ROLLING AGAIN.
Stephen: YES, A PILL THAT VIBRATES YOUR CONSTIPATION AWAY. SORRY PRUNES, YOU JUST LOST YOUR JOB TO A ROBOT. THE NEW PILL IS CALLED VIBRANT, A COMBINATION OF THE WORDS VIBRATE AND NNNT. (LAUGHTER) WHICH IS THE SOUND YOU MAKE WHEN IT'S WORKING. THE PILL PULSATES THREE TIMES A MINUTE AND MIMICS PERISTALSIS, THE BIOLOGICAL PROCESS THAT PUSHES WAVES OF WASTE THROUGH THE BOWELS, I KNOW YOU ARE SAYING WHERE I DO SIGN UP FOR WAVES OF WASTE. THAT'S MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS PILL. YOU CAN'T GET IT IT'S STILL IN CLINICAL TRIALS. BUT YOU FOLKS OUT THERE NEED RELIEF NOW. WHICH IS WHY I RECOMMEND YOU PUT YOUR CELL PHONE ON VIBRATE AND SHOVE IT WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE. AND--  (APPLAUSE) WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, WHY NOT MAKE IT A TOP OF THE LINE SMART PHONE FROM T-MOBILE. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE THE FASTEST NATIONWIDE 4GLTE NETWORK YOU CAN CALL YOUR COLON FROM ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY WITH GREAT RECEPTION NO MATTER HOW FAR YOU JAMMED IT UP THERE. AND T-MOBILE IS THE UNCARRIER, THE PHONE COMPANY THAT OFFERS CONTRACT FREEDOM. THAT MEANS NO ANNUAL SERVICE CONTRACTS, NO LIMITS ON DATA AND UPGRADES WHENEVER YOU WANT THE HOTTEST NEW SMART PHONE THROBBING YOUR DUODENUM. AND WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY? YOU HAVE ALREADY GOT A PHONE FROM ONE OF T-MOBILE'S COMPETITORS WEDGED UP THERE? NO PROBLEM, T-MOBILE WILL EVEN HELP PAY YOUR TERMINATION FEES WHEN YOU BREAK UP WITH YOUR OLD CARRIER, AND COVER UP TO FIVE DEVICES IN ONE PLAN, FINALLY THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN NESTLE THEM IN THEIR RECTUMS. NOW YOU MIGHT BE THINKING, YOU MIGHT BE THINKING STEPHEN, YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME PUSHING THIS T-MOBILE PRODUCT INTEGRATION. ARE YOU T-MOBILE'S PUPPET? NO, I WANT TO ASSURE YOU, NATION, T-MOBILE DID NOT ASK ME TO SAY ANY OF THIS. ALL THEIR MARKETING TEAM ASKED IS THAT I QUOTE NOT POSITION THE BRAND IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT. AND-- THAT, THAT, THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM. WHERE I'M TELLING YOU TO POSITION IT, THERE ISN'T ANY LIGHT AT ALL. REMEMBER, T-MOBILE, PUT IT IN YOUR BUTT. (APPLAUSE) NATION--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, I ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK. RIGHT AFTER I TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST UP, FOLKS, I'M SICK AND TIRED OF CHRISTIAN BAKERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS BEING FORCED TO PARTICIPATE IN GAY WEDDINGS THAT THEY DO NOT CONDONE. I MEAN YOU THINK THAT EVEN GAY PEOPLE WOULD BE AGAINST A MAN MARRYING ANOTHER MAN. IT IS KIND OF MATCHY-MATCHY. THANKFULLY ONE HEROIC BUSINESS IS STANDING UP. KENTUCKY'S HERALD EMBROIDERY WHICH TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A NEW STATE LAW PROTECTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM BY POSTING A SET OF STOREFRONT STICKERS. THREE WELCOMING CHRISTIANS, GUNS AND BEARDS. AND TWO BANNING FOUL LANGUAGE AND HOMOSEXUALS. SO IF YOU ARE GAY, YOU CAN'T GO IN. BUT YOUR BEARD CAN. WHICH IS WHY--  (LAUGHTER) I'M GIVING A RELUCTANT WAG OF THE FINGER TO HERALD EMBROIDERY FOR TAKING A GOOD IDEA TOO FAR. BECAUSE FOLLOWING A COMPLAINT FROM A LESBIAN COUPLE WHO WAS REFUSED SERVICE THE SHOP REPLACED THOSE STICKERS WITH A SIGNED READING WHILE WE WILL SERVE ALL CUSTOMERS WHO TREAT OUR PLACE OF BUSINESS WITH RESPECT, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO PRODUCE PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS THAT PROMOTE IDEAS THAT ARE NOT IN KEEPING WITH OUR CONSCIENCES THIS INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO CONTENT PROMOTING HOMOSEXUALITY, FREEMASONRY, THE USE OF FOUL LANGUAGE AND IMAGERY WHICH PROMOTES IMMODESTY. NOW WAIT A SECOND. I UNDERSTAND SHOWING THE GAYS THE DOOR. BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ME BECAUSE I'M A FREEMASON? (LAUGHTER) WHICH I AM NOT. BECAUSE IT'S A SECRET SOCIETY AND IF I WERE IN IT I WOULD HAVE TO LIE AND SAY THAT I AM NOT. WHICH I AM NOT. AND JUST THINK OF THE POOR FREEMASONS. DON'T THEY ALREADY FACE ENOUGH JUDGEMENT? I MEAN LIVING A DOUBLE LIFE, SNEAKING AROUND, NEVER BEING ABLE TO SHOW THEIR FAMILY WHO THEY REALLY ARE. AND ALL THE LIES. SAYING I'M JUST WORKING LATE, HONEY, WHEN REALLY I'M MEETING A BUNCH OF MEN TO DO GOD KNOWS WHAT IN A WINDOWLESS HALL. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S COME TO THIS. THE FREEMASONS ONCE CONTROLLED THE LEVERS OF GLOBAL POWER AND NOW WE CAN'T GET AN EMBROIDERED APRON, AGAIN, IS WHAT I WOULD SAY. AND NO, WE WILL NOT SETTLE FOR SILKSCREEN, WHAT AM I A [BLEEP] SHRINER? NEXT UP--  (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NEXT UP ON THE TIP WAGS THE LATEST BUZZ FROM THE WORLD OF INSECTS. WARNING, FOLKS, WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE IS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC SO IF THERE ARE ANY LARVAE IN THE ROOM WITH YOU NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME FOR THEM TO LEAVE AND PUPATE BECAUSE SCIENTISTS IN BRAZIL HAVE DISCOVERED A CAVE-DWELLING BUG WITH THE WORLD'S FIRST FEMALE PENIS. AND DEAR GOD, SHE IS HUNG LIKE A HORSE FLY. JIMMY, PLEASE, JIMMY, IT'S A FAMILY SHOW. THANK YOU. NOW IN THIS NEWLY DISCOVERED SPECIES, THE FEMALE USES HER ELABORATE PENIS-LIKE ORGAN TO PENETRATE THE MALE'S VAGINA LIKE OPENING AND COLLECT HIS SPERM. FEMALE PENISES, MALE VAGINAS, THANKS, GAY MARRIAGE. (APPLAUSE) WELL, THIS SHOCKING NEWS IS WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER AT BUG SCIENTISTS FOR DISCOVERING THIS, USED TO BE I COULD GIVE A QUICK GLANCE AT AN INSECT'S THORAX AND KNOW RIGHT AWAY IF I WAS SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO IT. BUT NOW IN THIS REPORT ON THESE INTERSEX INSECTS OR IN-SECTS, AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE FEMALE PENIS, I, NEY, ALL MEN ARE FORCED TO ASK OURSELVES, WHAT GENDER IS MY PENIS. I HAVE ALWAYS IDENTIFIED AS HAvING A MALE PENIS. BUT IT TURNS OUT I COULD BE SWINGING LADY JUNK. (LAUGHTER) AND IF SO, IS MY PENIS A LESBIAN BECAUSE SHE DEFINITELY HAS AN EYE FOR THE LADIES. NOW NEXT UP, NEXT UP ON TIPPY TIPPY WAGGERMAN, FOLKS, IF YOU FOLLOW THE NEWS YOU KNOW THAT BENGHAZI HAS BEEN BLOWING UP AGAIN BECAUSE OF A SCANDALOUS NEW MEMO LINKING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DIRECTLY TO THINGS SAID BY MEMBERS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND FOX NEWS'S THE FIVE'S THE ERIC BOLLING HAS AN IRONCLAD EXPLANATION FOR WHY THEY DID WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE ACCUSING THEM OF HAVING DONE AFTER THE BENGHAZI ATTACK.
ONE MORE PIECE TO THIS DON'T FORGET THIS WAS PRIOR, PRIOR TO OSAMA BIN LADEN BEING TAKEN DOWN. AND THE THOUGHT WAS AND THE DISCUSSION WAS, ASK PRESIDENT OBAMA GOING INTO THE RE-ELECTION SOFT ON TERROR OR NOT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT WAS AFTER.
MUCH AFTER.
WAS IT AFTER.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,.
MY BAD, I TAKE IT BACK.
A GREAT POINT IF IT WERE TRUE.
YES. THAT'S UNDENIABLE. YES. A GREAT POINT AND A FANTASTIC NEW MOTTO, FOX NEWS, FAIR AN BALANCED, A GREAT POINT IF IT WERE TRUE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) STILL-- I'VE GOT TO GIVE A WAG OF MY FINGER TO DANA PERINO. WHY DID YOU CORRECT HIM? BOLLING WAS PULLING A PASSIONATE HEART-FELT CONSPIRACY THEORY STRAIGHT OUT OF HIS ASS. YOU DON'T INTERRUPT A MAN IN MID YANK, THAT'S RUDE. (LAUGHTER) JUST SAY GREAT POINT. BECAUSE BOLLING WAS RIGHT, UP TO A POINT. OBAMA NOT HAVING CAUGHT BIN LADEN AT THE TIME OF THE BENGHAZI ATTACKS WOULD HAVE MADE HIM LOOK SOFT ON TERROR IF TIME HAPPENED IN THAT ORDER. -- HAPPENED IN THAT ORDER. SO DANA, COME ON, GIVE YOUR COLLEAGUES A BREAK. THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BENGHAZI NONSTOP FOR 20 MONTHS. YOU CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO REMEMBER THE EXACT DAY THAT IT HAPPENED. I MEAN WHEN WAS IT ANYWAY?
OH, SEPTEMBER 11th. WELL, HOW ON EARTH ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO NEVER FORGET THAT? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
