(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! GOOD TO SEE YA! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US! WHOO!! WHOO!! WHOO!! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU, I'VE JUST GOT TO LISTEN TO THIS,  HOLD ON ONE SECOND. HERE WE GO. ONE, TWO, THREE! ♪ MY BABY DON'T MESS AROUND  ♪ BECAUSE SHE SOMETHIN' SOMETHIN' I KNOW FOR SURE... ♪  ♪ BUT DOES SHE REALLY WANT  OH I'M SORRY. I'M JUST LOVING THIS FEELING BECAUSE I'M PARTYING LIKE IT'S 2003. I'VE GOT SOME "HEY YA!" CRANKING IN THE EARBUDS OF MY ORIGINAL iPod ONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS THING IS AMAZING. DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN STORE UP TO 1,000 COPIES OF "HEY YA!"? (LAUGHTER) I'M CELEBRATING LIKE IT'S 2003 BECAUSE, AT LONG LAST, WE'VE WON THE WAR IN IRAQ. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO, I'M SORRY, GUYS. NO, JIMMY, THE EARLIER ONE. NO, NOT THAT EARLY. YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE RIGHT THERE! THERE'S YOUR SWEET SPOT! TELL 'EM WHY.
THIS IS A BIG ONE. A BOMBSHELL NEW DISCOVERY BY THE "NEW YORK TIMES," WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WERE FOUND IN IRAQ BUT IT WAS KEPT SECRET. THE "TIMES" REPORTING BETWEEN 2004 AND 2011, AMERICAN TROOPS FOUND 5,000 CHEMICAL WARHEADS.
5,000 SHELLS AND BOMBS CONTAINING THINGS LIKE SARIN AND MUSTARD GAS.
SADDAM DID HAVE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
THE STORY SHOWS THAT, IN FACT, SADDAM DID STILL HAVE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN 2003 WHEN WE INVADED.
Stephen: BUSH WAS RIGHT! IRAQ HAD WMDs THE WHOLE TIME! I FEEL A COMBINATION OF TWO STRONG EMOTIONS -- OH, MY GOD, SHOCK AND AWE! (LAUGHTER) I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT, SIR! THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT ELSE BUSH WAS RIGHT ABOUT. I BET SOME OF THOSE WEAPONS WERE "NUCULAR"? (LAUGHTER) THIS VINDICATION MUST REALLY WARM DICK CHENEY'S -- ARC REACTOR? I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT IN THERE NOW. NOTHING BUT NOTHING IS GOING TO KILL MY BUZZ OVER THESE WMDs NOT EVEN THE SECOND LINE OF EVERY STORY ABOUT THEM.
THESE WERE NOT THE WEAPONS WE WENT TO WAR OVER. THESE WERE OLD DISCARDED WEAPONS
THEY WERE NOT THE SO-CALLED WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION USED TO JUSTIFY THE INVASION. THEY WERE FROM THE OLD  SHELLS AND WARHEADS FROM THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR.
Stephen: SHAKE IT, COME ON SHAKE IT, SHAKE IT LIKE A POLAROID PICTURE. BEYONCE'S, AND LUCY LIU'S, AND BABY DOLL'S. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T CATCH A LOT OF THAT. POINT IS, IRAQ MADE THESE AWFUL WEAPONS, AND AMERICA HAD A MORAL OBLIGATION TO PUNISH THEM AND ANYONE WHO HELPED THEM.
THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BITTEREST IRONIES OF THE IRAQ WAR. THESE ARE WEAPONS THAT IRAQ HAD MANUFACTURED WITH HELP FROM WESTERN COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE U.S. DURING ITS WAR WITH IRAN IN THE 1980s.
Stephen: OKAY. SO WE HELPED ARM THEM WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN THE 1980s. BUT COME ON, THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE REGRET FROM THE '80s. WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF WE ALSO ARMED THEM WITH BUNS OF STEEL. (LAUGHTER) AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW WHAT DONALD RUMSFELD AND SADDAM HUSSEIN WERE SHAKING HANDS OVER IN 1983! HERE'S WHAT WE DID, ACTUALLY IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY. BACK WHEN IRAQ WAS FIGHTING IRAN, TWO AMERICAN COMPANIES PROVIDED HUNDREDS OF TONS OF THIODIGLYCOL, A MUSTARD GAS AGENT PRECURSOR, INCLUDING THE COMPANY CARDINAL STABILIZER, A  SPECIALTY CHEMICAL FIRM FROM MY HOMETOWN OF CHARLESTON, SOUTH  CAROLINA. WELL, NOW I FINALLY KNOW THE SECRET TO MY STATE'S  DELICIOUS BARBECUE -- A TANGY MUSTARD-GAS SAUCE. SO GOOD YOU WILL CLAW YOUR EYES OUT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU WILL SLAP YOUR GRANDMA! (LAUGHTER) AND THIS W-M-DISCOVERY IS NEWS TO EVERYONE BECAUSE EVEN "CONGRESS WAS ONLY PARTLY INFORMED" THESE WEAPONS EXISTED, WHILE "TROOPS AND OFFICERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO BE SILENT OR GIVE DECEPTIVE ACCOUNTS OF WHAT THEY HAD FOUND." IT WAS SORT OF A "DON'T ASK DON'T TELL" FOR THE LGBT WMD COMMUNITY. (LAUGHTER) POINT IS, THE STORY PROVES ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT THE WAR WAS COMPLETELY NECESSARY AND JUSTIFIED. HERE TO SAY HIS STORY DOESN'T SAY THAT IS PULITZER PRIZE WINNING REPORTER FROM THE "NEW YORK TIMES," REPORTER C.J. CHIVERS. GOOD TO SEE YOU.  HERE'S THE ARTICLE BLOWING THE LID OFF EVERYTHING.  HERE'S MY NUMBER ONE QUESTION. PROVES WE HAD WMDs THERE IN IRAQ. WHY DIDN'T GEORGE BUSH BRAG ABOUT THIS MORE BECAUSE THE EGG ON HIS FACE IS THAT THERE WERE NO WMDs. WAS HE BEING JUST TOO HUMBLE HERE? WAS THE WAR SO POPULAR HE DIDN'T WANT TO RUN UP THE SCOREBOARD AT THIS POINT?
THESE WEREN'T THE WMDs HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. THESE WEAPONS WERE OLD DISCARDED JUNK FROM ABOUT TWO WARS BEFORE.
Stephen: DON'T TRY YOUR OBI-WAN KENOBI "THESE AREN'T THE DROIDS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR" ON ME (LAUGHTER)
THEY WEREN'T EVEN USED AS WMDs
Stephen: SO THEY'RE NOT DANGEROUS AT ALL?
THEY'RE DANGEROUS, THEY'RE USED IN LOCAL ATTACKS AND IMPROVISED BOMBS WHERE THEY WERE DISCARDED IN OLD STOCKPILES.
Stephen: WHY DIDN'T WE FIND OUT ABOUT THEM AT ALL TILL YOUR ARTICLE.
ACTUALLY YOU DID. THROUGH 2004, OUR GOVERNMENT HAD A GOOD RECORD OF DISCLOSING A LOT OF THE INFORMATION. CHARLES DUELFER IN THE IRAQ SURVEY GROUP GAVE US A THOROUGH REPORT THROUGH 2004 THAT STANDS UP TO THIS DAY, BUT BY 2006 THEY STOPPED TALKING ABOUT IT AND IN 2006 THE NUMBER OF DISCOVERIES TOOK OFF AND THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THAT WERE WOUNDED ALSO ACCELERATED SHARPLY AND AT THAT POINT THERE HAD BEEN A TURN IN THE PRACTICE AND THEY WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WEREN'T.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHY THIS SUDDENLY BECAME A SECRET?
THROUGH 2004, THE RECORD'S GOOD. HAD THEY CONTINUED THE PRACTICE, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO SIT HERE AND TELL YOU ABOUT THIS. THIS COULD HAVE COME OUT IN REALTIME AND BEEN A SERIES OF SMALL STORIES AND DIGESTED BY THE PERSON PUBLIC AND THE BODY POLITIC A LONG TIME AGO.
Stephen: SPEAKING OF SMALL STORIES, THIS IS NOT A SMALL STORY. NOT ONLY HAS IT MADE A BIG SPLASH, BUT IT'S AN EXTREMELY LONG ARTICLE IN HERE. IS THIS WHY THE "NEW YORK TIMES" DOESN'T HAVE A COMICS PAGE? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE ZIGGY NEVER DEPRESSES ME LIKE THIS.
I THINK IT'S SHORT. I FILED TWICE AS LONG.
Stephen: REALLY? AND THEY CUT IT IN HALF?
YES.
Stephen: YOU ALREADY GOT A PULITZER. WHEN YOU HOLD UP YOUR PULITZER, DOES IT GLOW BLUE LIKE STING DOES WHEN ORCS ARE AROUND?
NO, THIS IS A STORY ABOUT ENLISTED SOLDIERS WHO HAD ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS JOBS ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN THE LAST WAR, WHO WORKED HARD, SERVED WELL, SUFFERED SOMETHING SURPRISING AND WERE AT A MINIMUM CASUALTY-NEGLECTED IF NOT OUTRIGHT ABUSED.
Stephen: DID THE GUYS WHO FOUND THE STUFF, THEY WERE INJURED BY THIS.
MANY WERE NOT WOUNDED. SOME WERE WOUNDED.
Stephen: DID THEY GET A PURPLE HEART?
MOST OF THEM DID NOT.
Stephen: BECAUSE IT HAD TO BE A SECRET?
THEY DIDN'T GET PURPLE HEARTS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT AMONG THEM IS THE PURPLE HEART SYSTEM BY MY ESTIMATE IS BROKEN. THERE ARE FOUR SERVICES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT PROCESSES AND DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR GETTING THE PURPLE HEART. SOME OF THESE MEMBERS WERE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PURPLE HEARTS, OTHERS WERE BY COMMANDERS AND DENIED BY THE SERVICES. ONE PARTICULAR INCIDENT A STAFF SERGEANT HAD A PURPLE HEART GIVEN BY THE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY AND SOMEONE SEVERAL WEEKS LATER CAME ALONG AND TOOK IT OFF HIS CHEST.
Stephen: WHY WAS IT TAKEN OFF?
THEY SAID THEY ERRONEOUSLY ISSUED IT.
Stephen: BECAUSE THE EVENT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE HAPPENED?
THAT'S THE QUESTION I HAVE BEEN ASKING THEM FOR MANY MONTHS.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT MEDICAL CARE? THESE SOLDIERS, I UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES DOCTORS WERE NOT TOLD THAT THEY'D ENCOUNTERED CHEMICAL WEAPONS FOR SECRECY REASONS.
WE TALKED ABOUT SECRECY, THAT'S RIGHT. FOR MANY OF THESE TROOPS THE CHEMICAL SYMPTOMS TOOK TIME TO MANIFEST THEMSELVES,  CAME TO SICK CALL THE DAY AFTER THE EVENT. AND BECAUSE NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW THAT CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE STILL A FEATURE OF THE BATTLEFIELD, THE DOCTORS WERE NOT  ANTICIPATING THE CASUALTIES AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY LOOKED AT OTHER POTENTIAL CAUSES  DEHYDRATION, SUNBURN, EXHAUSTION.
Stephen: LACTOSE INTOLERANCE. SOMETHING ELSE. (LAUGHTER) AS A RESULT, DID THEY NOT GET PROPER MEDICAL CARE?
MANY DID NOT. SOME WERE NEGLECTED CARE.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE PENTAGON'S RESPONSE SO FAR?
THE PENTAGON'S RESPONSE IS I'M NOT WORKING IN WASHINGTON SO I DIDN'T WALK INTO THE PENTAGON BUT THE PENTAGON ESSENTIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE FINDINGS AND I'VE HEARD THEY'RE TAKING STEPS TO MAKE SURE THE TROOPS WHO WERE EXPOSED ARE TREATED WELL AND THERE'S SOME TALK THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE PURPLE HEARTS AND THE SOLDIERS WHO DIDN'T RECEIVE THEM AND TRYING TO FIND IF THERE'S A LARGER POPULATION OF EXPOSED VETERANS TO GET THEM ENROLLED IN CARE.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. C.J. CHIVERS, THE SECRET CASUALTIES OF IRAQ'S ABANDONED CHEMICAL WEAPONS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
