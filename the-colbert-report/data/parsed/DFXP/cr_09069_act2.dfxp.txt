[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. COME ON! THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, YOU KNOW -- F  9:K AT  MIDNIGHT TONIGHT A TICKING TIME  BOMB GOES OFF IN WASHINGTON AND FOR ONCE I'M NOT CONFUSING REAL  LIFE WITH AN EPISODE OF  HOMELAND. THE HOFF RISK SCENARIO --  HORRIFIC SCENARIO AWAITING US ISBe!|  SEQUESTRATION. WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? [LAUGHTER]
MARCH 1 AN AUTOMATIC ACROSS  THE BOARD SPENDING CUT�r WILL HIT  THE FEDERAL BUDGET. ECONOMISTS ARE WORRIED IT WILL  TRIGGER A RECESSION.
IT MEANS CUTTING $85 BILLION  A YEAR HALF FROM THE PENTAGON,  HALF FROM NONDEFENSE PROGRAMS. EVERYTHING FROM EDUCATION TO  NATIONAL PARKS TO MEALS ON  WHEELS. $1.2 TRILLION IN CUTS OVER TEN  YEARS.
Stephen: YEAH, BUT IT WON'T  BE THAT BAD BECAUSE THERE'S NO  WAY AMERICA IS GOING TO LAST TEN  YEARS. WE HAVE TWO TOPS. [LAUGHTER] OBAMA IS TRYING TO SCARE US INTO  RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR.
THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS AND  EDUCATORS WILL BE LAID OFF. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND  AIRPORT SECURITY WILL SEE  CUTBACKS WHICH MEANS MORE DELAYS AT AIRPORTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EMERGENCY RESPONDERS, THEIR  ABILITY TO HELP COMMUNITIES  RESPOND TO AND RECOVER FROM DISASTERS WILL BE DEGRADED. FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HAVE TO  CLOSE CASES AND LET CRIMINALS  GO.
Stephen: DON'T BELIEVE HIM  NATION, OBAMA IS TRYING TO  CONVINCE US THE SEQUESTER IS A TERRIBLE PROBLEM WHEN IN FACT  IT'S A TERRIBLE SOLUTION. IT WAS BORN BACK IN 2011 WHEN  OBAMA WANTED TO RAISE THE DEBT  CEILING. THE AMOUNT THAT AMERICA CAN  BORROW TO PAY ITS BILLS. IT'S SORT OF LIKE RAISING THE  CREDIT LIMIT ON YOUR VISA TO PAY  OFF YOUR MASTERCARD IF YOU HAD USED YOUR MASTERCARD TO PAY FOR  TWO TRILLION-DOLLAR WARS. BUT -- LISTEN, WAIT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY WERE WORTH IT BECAUSE NOW  WE CAN USE ALL THE FREE MILES TO  GO TO THE NEXT WAR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THE REPUBLICANS -- BUT THE  REPUBLICANS WOULD ONLY RAISE THE  DEBT CEILING IF THE PRESIDENT PROMISED LATER SPENDING CUTS. IF THOSE WERE NOT PASSED BY AN  ARBITRARY DATE, IT WOULD TRIGGER  THE SEQUESTER, A DOOMSDAY SCENARIO DESIGNED TO CRIPPLE  PROGRAMS THAT BOTH SIDES LOVE. THE DEMOCRATS WOULD SEE DAMAGING  REDUCTIONS IN EDUCATION,  NATIONAL PARKS, VACCINATION PROGRAMS, FOOD INSPECTION, EVEN  THE NATIONAL ZOO WHILE  REPUBLICANS WOULD SEE CUTS TO EVERYTHING THEY HOLD DEAR LIKE  THE MILITARY. [LAUGHTER] THE POINT IS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- IF THE TWO SIDES FAILED TO  COME TO A COMPROMISE IN MARCH  2013 WOULD COME IN LIKE�i A LION AND GO OUT LIKE A LION LOOSE  FROM THE UNGUARDED NATIONAL ZOO. IT WAS A GOOD PLAN AS LONG AS  ONE OF THE SIDES DIDN'T FORGET  THAT IT WAS A HORRIBLE PLAN.
YOU KNOW, LOOK, WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT $85 BILLION.�i  WE BORROW $85 BILLION EVERY THREE DAYS. THIS IS THREE TENTHS OF 1% OF  G.D.P. IT'S TWO CENTS ON THE DOLLAR.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS  HIGHLY INEFFICIENT. IT COULD USE A 5% OR 10% CUT.
Stephen: THAT IS A  COURAGEOUS STANCE BY RUDY  GIULIANI. THAT ELIMINATE ONLY 280,000  JOBS, NONE OF WHICH ARE HIS. IN RETROSPECT, WE SHOULD HAVE  SEEN THIS FAILGrG COMING. IT'S JUST LIKE THE STORY FROM  THE BIBLE AND LO KING SALOMON  SAID IF I CANNOT AGREE WHOSE BABY THIS IS I'LL CUT IT IN HALF  AND ONE MOM SAID, GREAT, HALF A  BABY. PROBABLY LESS WORK ANYWAY IF YOU  GET THE TOP HALF NEW YORK DIAPER�i  CHANGES. [LAUGHTER] BUT, FOARKZAGE THINK THE KNOW  WHY THE SEQUESTER IS NOT WORKING  BECAUSE Juz DOESN'T EFFECT  CONGRESS. THE SALARIES OF SENATORS AND  REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT GET CUT. [AUDIENCE OOHS] IT'S LIKE A LONE  SHARK SAYING IF YOU DON'T PAY UP  HE'S GOING TO BREAK YOUR NEIGHBOR'S LEGS. NO SKIN OFF THEIR NOSE. ALSO, HE IS TAKING YOUR  NEIGHBOR'S NOSE BUT THAT DOESN'T  MEAN IT WAS A BAD IDEA. REMEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT THAT  GOVERNS BEST IS ONE THAT FORCES  ITSELF TO EITHER MAKE TOUGH ZOIRGSES SUFFER UNIMAGINEIBLY  HORRIBLE CONSEQUENCES. I BELIEVE IT WAS JEFFERSON WHO  SAID THAT OR JIGSAW. THEREFORE, TO PREVENT THE NEXT  CRISIS WE NEED A WORST SCENARIO. I SAY WE SOCIAL SECURITY SPEND  A -- SUSPEND A MONKEY ABOVE THE  FLOOR OF CONGRESS, AN EBOLA MONKEY AND THEN SMEAR EACH  MEMBER OF CONGRESS WITH MONKEY  MEAT AND BANANAS. IF THEY DON'T REACH A DEAL BY  THE DEADLINE THE ROPES ARE CUT,  THE DOORS ARE L
