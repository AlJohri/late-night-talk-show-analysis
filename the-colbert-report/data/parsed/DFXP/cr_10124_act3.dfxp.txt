( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT PLAYS A DRUG ADDICTED NURSE. I WILL INTERVIEW HER PROVIDED SHE CAN PASS MY URINE TEST. PLEASE WELCOME EDIE FALCO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING ON. WHAT A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU ON.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. THANK YOU.
Stephen:  WE'VE BEEN WANTING TO HAVE YOU ON FOR A LONG TIME. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW YOU WERE THE ONLY ACTRESS TO WIN AN ENEMY IN BOTH THE DRAMATIC AND COMEDY CATEGORIES. YOU WON THREE FOR, OBVIOUSLY, YOUR WORK AS CARMELA ON "THE SOPRANOS." AND ONE FOR YOUR CURRENT SHOW "NURSE JACKIE," ON SHOWTIME, SEASON 6 FINALE ON SUNDAY AT 9:00 P.M. YOUR CHARACTER IS ADDICTED TO PERCOCET, VICODIN, ADDERALL, XANAX AND OXYCONTIN.
RIGHT.
Stephen:  HOW MUCH RESEARCH DID YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET READY FOR THAT?
I TAKE MY WORK VERY SERIOUSLY, SO I'M, AS WE SPEAK, DOING RESEARCH.
Stephen:  OKAY, GOOD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AFTER SIX YEARS OF PLAYING A NURSE, DO YOU EVER SAY TO YOURSELF, "I COULD FAKE MY WAY THROUGH A SHIFT?" DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GO INTO A HOSPITAL AND KIND OF ( BLEEP ) FOR THE FIRST SIX HOURS.
NOT A CHANCE.
Stephen:  JUST YELL THE WORD "STAT" A LOT.
NO, I GET MORE NERVOUS NOW THAN I EVER DID AROUND SICKNESS BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK I CAN DO SOMETHING. I RUN IN THE OTHER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
Stephen:  DO NURSES EVER COME UP TO YOU AND SAY, "YEAH, THAT FEELS RIGHT TO ME. YOU GET IT RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE."
THOSE ARE THE ONES WHO TALK TO ME. THE ONES WHO DON'T TALK TO ME DON'T FEEL THAT WAY. APPARENTLY THERE ARE NURSES WHO FEEL OTHER THAN THAT, BUT THEY'RE NOT COMING UP TO ME AND FOR THAT I'M VERY GRATEFUL.
Stephen:  IN SEASON 1, THE SHOW WAS PROTESTED BY THE NEW YORK STATE NURSE'S ASSOCIATION BECAUSE YOUR CHARACTER "HAD NO QUALMS ABOUT REPEATEDLY VIOLATING THE NURSING CODE OF ETHICS." DO THEY NOT KNOW HOW ACTING WORKS?
I STAY SO FAR OUT OF THAT STUFF, YOU HAVE NO IDEA. I ONLY HEAR ABOUT IT WHEN SOMEBODY TELLS ME ABOUT IT. IT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT I WANT TO GET INTO. IT'S A STORY ABOUT A PRETEND LADY.
Stephen:  IT IS A PRETEND LADY. ( LAUGHTER ).
A VERY NICE LADY.
Stephen:  YEAH.
TROUBLED.  WHY DO YOU-- SOME WOULD SAY PRETEND. I LIKE TO THINK OF ACTORS AS LIARS. WHY DO YOU LIE FOR A LIVING? WHY ARE YOU AN ACTRESS?
WELL, I SPENT MANY YEARS PRACTICING THAT PARTICULAR SKILL AS WELL, AS I AM RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  NO, NO, I LIKE, THAT I LIKE THAT. SO YOU'RE A LIAR.
A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen:  AREN'T WE ALL, THOUGH?
KIND OF, RIGHT.
Stephen:  IT'S LOVELY TO HAVE YOU HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LIE.
Stephen:  NO, NOT AT ALL. YOU HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN YOU HAVE-- YOU HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN ABOUT YOUR OWN SOBRIETY AND YOUR OWN RECOVERY. IS PLAYING NURSE JACKIE, IS IT TEMPTING TO ABUSE AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING SOMEBODY WHO IS ABUSING OR IS IT JUST A REMINDER TO NEVER TOUCH IT AGAIN.
I'M LUCKY IN THAT IT'S THE SECOND OF THOSE TWO THINGS. IT MAKES ME SO GLAD THAT I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT ANYMORE. YOU GET TO REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE ALL MIXED UP IN THAT CHAOS AND THAT KIND OF POLLUTED HEAD AND CONFUSED STATE ALL THE TIME, WHERE IT'S SORT OF A WAY OF LIFE.
Stephen:  SO IT ACTUALLY HELPS?
IT TOTALLY HELPS. ABSOLUTELY. I DON'T KNOW I COULD SAY IT'S THAT WAY FOR EVERYBODY, BUT IT IS THAT WAY FOR ME.
Stephen:  WHEN I'M DIETING, I LIKE TO BAKE FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT. I KNOW A LOT OF SOBER BARTENDERS.
Stephen:  REALLY.
I TOTALLY GET IT. "DRINK THIS ONE. DRINK THIS ONE. IT'S REALLY GOOD."
Stephen:  I LIKE TO SAY "WAS IT CRUNCHY?" WHEN YOU PLAYED CARMELLA WHY DO YOU THINK SO MANY PEOPLE-- NURSE JACKIE DOES NOT MAKE ADDICTION LOOK GOOD. SHE'S NOT LIKE KEITH RICHARDS. SHE DOES NOT MAKE IT LOOK GOOD. BUT CARMELA IS A BELOVED MATRIARCH, ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED OF ANY MATRIARCH IN A TV SHOW. WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE LOVED HER SO MUCH WHEN SHE KNEW HER HUSBAND WAS KILLING PEOPLE AND DUMPING THEM IN THE RIVER AND SHE DID NOTHING TO STOP TO THEM?
VERY COMPLICATED THAT. I'M NOT THE WRITER, SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW. SHE WAS DEVOTED TO THE THINGS A MOTHER SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO-- HER CHILDREN, HER HUSBAND, HER FAMILY-- AND WAS LIVING IN THIS GIANT DENIAL HEAD ABOUT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY GOING ON. THAT'S AS MUCH AS I CAN EXPLAIN IT FROM SORT OF AN  INTELLECTUAL BRAIN. THE WHOLE THING MADE SENSE TO ME WHEN I WAS DOING IT. I JUST THOUGHT SHE LOVED HER HUSBAND AND HER KIDS, THINKING  HE WORKS HARD, I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT--
Stephen:  HERE'S SOMETHING THAT MADE A LITTLE LESS SENSE, THE ENDING OF THE SOPRANOS. I HAVE A GUESS THAT NURSE JACKIE IS CARMELA IN THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM. AND SHE TAKES THE DRUG TO FORGET. YOU CAN HAVE THAT ONE FOR FREE. YOU TELL THE WRITERS.
GRATEFUL ISN'T A BIG ENOUGH WORD.
YOU WORK WITH PETA ALSO. YOU'RE A VEGETARIAN.
I AM.
YOU WORK WITH PETA. SPECIFICALLY, YOU URGED PARENTS TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN AWAY FROM THE CIRCUS BECAUSE OF THE USE OF ANIMALS FOR THE CIRCUS.
YEAH.
Stephen:  HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GUYS TAKING SELFIES WITH TIGERS?
THAT'S A ROUGH ONE, YOU KNOW. IT DEPENDS ON HOW INTO IT THE TIGERS WERE.
Stephen:  EDIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
MY PLEASURE.
Stephen:  EDIE FALCO, NURSE JACKIE ON SHOWTIME,  THIS SUNDAY AT 9. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
