(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OH, HEY! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US! I'M SORRY, I'M JUST, I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE THING. I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YA! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU!  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I'M SORRY. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN JUST ONE MINUTE. I JUST NEED ONE SECOND HERE. I'M JUST TRYING TO LOAD THE IPHONE 6 ANNOUNCEMENT, SO I CAN FIND OUT WHY I SUDDENLY HATE THe IPHONE 5 I'M WATCHING IT ON. (LAUGHTER) WOW, WOW. 7.1 MILLIMETERS. I WONDER HOW MANY THAT IS? (LAUGHTER) BUT OF COURSE, THE IPHONE 6 WASN'T THE BIG SURPRISE. MANY PEOPLE PREDICTED 6 WOULD COME AFTER 5. (LAUGHTER)
I AM SO EXCITED AND I AM SO PROUD TO SHARE IT WITH YOU THIS MORNING. IT IS THE NEXT CHAPTER IN APPLE'S STORY. (LAUGHTER) ♪♪ (LAUGHTER) ♪♪
STEPHEN: WOO! WOO! WOO! WOO WOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DOES IT DO? (LAUGHTER) I GOTTA HAVE THE APPLE WATCH! IT'S FINALLY COOL TO WEAR A CALCULATOR WATCH! WHO'S THE NERD, NOW, BEN MCGOOKEN?! I MEAN, THIS THING THIS THING RIGHT HERE IS GONNA CHANGE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT YOUR WRIST. BUT DON'T TAKE MY HYPE FOR IT. TAKE THEIRS.
WE'VE INVENTED NEW, INTIMATE WAYS TO CONNECT AND COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY FROM YOUR WRIST.
Stephen: I THOUGHT I KNEW ALL THE INTIMATE WAYS TO WRIST-COMMUNICATE. WHAT'S LEFT? WRIST IN BUTT? I DON'T KNOW... (LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS -- (LAUGHTER) TRAGICALLY, THE APPLE WATCH IS NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL 2015, WHENEVER THAT IS, CAUS I DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE AN APPLE WATCH! (LAUGHTER) BUT I DID MANAGE TO GET MY HANDS ON AN EVEN MORE CUTTING EDGE PRODUCT FROM AN APPLE INSIDER. WELL TECHNICALLY AN APPLE OUTSIDER. HE WAS IN THE ALLY BEHIND THE APPLE STORE. SO SAY HELLO TO THE NEW WRIST PAD! (LAUGHTER) THERE IT IS. LOOK AT THIS. THE SCREEN SIZE. THIS IS EXCLUSIVE. THIS IS EXCLUSIVE. LOOK AT THAT!  YEAH! (APPLAUSE) THE SCREEN SIZE IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE APPLE WATCH. SEE, LET'S SEE, WHAT TIME IS IT? 11:04 -- AND IS THAT RIGHT? YES, IT IS. ALL RIGHT. THIS THING IS GONNA BE HUGE. OK? I JUST GOTTA GET OUT THE I-SCISSORS! THERE WE GO. THERE YOU GO. (LAUGHTER) AND, MM-HMM -- YOU CAN USE THIS TO GIVE YOURSELF AN IBRAZILIAN. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. MM-HMM, MM-HMM. ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) NATION, THE MID-TERMS ARE ALMOST HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THE MID-TERMS ARE ALMOST HERE, AND REMEMBER THEY COUNT FOR 30% OF YOUR GRADE. AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO BE KICKING ASS AND TAKING SEATS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A MESSAGE THAT APPEALS TO ALL AMERICANS, IF YOU DON'T COUNT 51% OF THEM.
AN EXCLUSIVE REPORT ON POLITICO STATES A STUDY ORDERED BY TWO REPUBLICAN GROUPS FOUND THAT FEMALE VOTERS FEEL THE PARTY IS "STUCK IN THE PAST." THEY ALSO SAID THE G.O.P. WAS INTOLERANT AND LACKED COMPASSION. NEARLY 50% OF WOMEN HAD AN UNFAVORABLE VIEW OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS IN WORSE SHAPE WITH WOMEN NOW THAN IT WAS IN 2010. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
I'M NOT SURE. IN SPITE OF ALL THIS CHATTER, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT YEAR.
Stephen: YEP, GREAT YEAR. SUPER GOOD. WHAT WERE YOU SAYING? I COULDN'T HEAR YOU WITH ALL THE CHATTER ABOUT HOW WOMEN HATE US. OKAY, SO REPUBLICANS ARE HAVING SOME LADY PROBLEMS. AND THEY CAN'T FIX THEM THE WAY YOU NORMALLY DO, BY DRINKING ALONE IN THE DEN WITH BILLY JOEL'S "BIG SHOT" CRANKED ALL THE WAY UP. (SINGING) NOW YOU HAD TO BE A BIG SHOT, DIDN'T YA! YOU HAD TO PROVE IT TO THE CROWD! YOU HAD TO BE A BIG SHOT, DIDN'T YA! OH YOUR FRIENDS WERE SO KNOCKED OUT. (APPLAUSE) YOU HAD TO HAVE THE LAST WORD LAST NIGHT, SO YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYTHING'S ABOUT. YOU HAD TO HAVE THE WHITE HOT SPOTLIGHT. (LAUGHTER) BUT, BECAUSE NONE OF THIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT INTO THE SHOW -- (AUDIENCE REACTS) -- BUT THERE'S HOPE FOR THE G.O.P. IN THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OF STEPHEN COLBERT'S "MID TERM ROUNDUP." ♪♪ YEE-HAW! ONCE AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN, THANKS TO STEVE CARELL FOR FLYING IN TO DO THAT LIVE. THANK YOU, STEVE! YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. NOW FIRST UP, I'M A LONG-TIME FAN OF OF FORMER MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR AND UNDERSTUDY IN THE MITT ROMNEY MUSICAL, SCOTT BROWN. IN 2010, BROWN SWEPT INTO OFFICE WITH AN INSPIRING MESSAGE FOR AMERICA --
I'M SCOTT BROWN. I'M FROM WRENTHAM. AND I DRIVE A TRUCK!
Stephen: IT WAS THE MOST EXCITING SENATE RUN OF MAN AND TRUCK SINCE SENATOR OPTIMUS PRIME. NOW BROWN IS RUNNING FOR SENATE AGAIN IN THE HEART OF MASSACHUSETTS. NEW HAMPSHIRE. AGAINST INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT AND DR. SEUSS TRIBUTE NAME JEANNE SHAHEEN. UNFORTUNATELY, BROWN IS LOSING THE WOMEN VOTE TO SHAHEEN BY 39 TO 53%. HAVEN'T THE LADIES OF NEW HAMPSHIRE SEEN HIS OLD COSMO PHOTOSPREAD? I MEAN, HE SHOULD HAVE AN EASY PATH TO THE SENATE. JUST FOLLOW THE TREASURE TRAIL. BUT SCOTT BROWN HAS A NEW PLAN TO WIN FEMALE VOTERS -- GIVE THEM THE WOMEN FOR SCOTT BROWN HERO AWARD! SEEN HERE BEING GIVEN TO NEW HAMPSHIRE BUSINESSWOMAN JANICE LEAHY. BROWN COMMEMORATED THE OCCASION IN A PRESS RELEASE, SAYING -- I'M PLEASED TO AWARD JANICE WITH A HERO AWARD TO CELEBRATE HER DETERMINATION TO MAINTAIN A BUSINESS DESPITE GOVERNMENT RED TAPE AND BURDENSOME REGULATIONS... IT IS VERY TROUBLING TO LISTEN TO JANET'S STORY. THE MOST TROUBLING THING ABOUT JANET'S STORY? HER NAME IS JANICE. (LAUGHTER) BUT THAT, THAT IS NOT SCOTT BROWN'S FAULT. I MEAN, HOW'S HE SUPPOSED TO REMEMBER HER NAME? IT'S NOT LIKE THEY WENT TO THE TROUBLE TO PUT IT ON THE PLAQUE. I MEAN, THAT'S AN EXTRA 2 CENTS A LETTER. JANE HERE WAS CLEARLY MOVED BY THE HONOR. AS SHE TOLD TIME MAGAZINE, SHE WAS LEFT CONFUSED AND EMBARRASSED BY THE WHOLE EPISODE, BUT I'M SURE THAT JANINE WILL REMEMBER THIS GREAT HONOR COME ELECTION DAY. SCOTT HAS ALREADY INSPIRED ME TO RECOGNIZE THE HARD WORKING BUSINESS GALS ON MY STAFF. COME ON OUT HERE, ABBY! ABBY, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW -- THANK YOU. ABBY --
IT'S ARIEL.
Stephen: I'M SORRY, WHAT?
IT'S ARIEL.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SAYS ON THE PRESS RELEASE  RIGHT HERE. ALL RIGHT. I WAS TOLD YOU WANTED A MEETING WITH ME?
WELL, YES, BUT I DIDN'T MEAN ON THE SHOW.
Stephen: THIS IS THE ONLY FREE TIME I'VE GOT. I WAS IN MEETINGS ALL DAY WITH LEVEL 35 OF CANDY CRUSH. WHAT'S UP?
OKAY. WELL, I FOUND OUT THAT JEREMY IS MAKING MORE MONEY THAN I AM, EVEN THOUGH WE DO THE EXACT SAME JOB. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: THAT, THAT IS, THAT IS A SERIOUS ACCUSATION. WHO GAVE YOU THAT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR SALARIES?
I'M THE ACCOUNTANT.
Stephen: WELL, I'M SORRY, AVERY. I'M WITH SCOTT BROWN. WE CANNOT HAVE BURDENSOME REGULATIONS ON SMALL BUSINESS. I SHOULD KNOW, THIS PROGRAM IS REGISTERED AS A FAMILY-RUN DRY-CLEANER, SO I CAN DEDUCT MY BAR BILL AS CHEMICAL SOLVENTS. BUT IT TOOK A LOT OF GIRL-BALLS FOR YOU TO COME HERE, AMBER. AND TO REWARD THAT ENTERPRISING SPIRIT, I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT YOU ARE THE FIRST EVER WINNER OF THE "WOMEN FOR STEPHEN COLBERT FEMALE LADY ACHIEVER, NO PENIS? NO PROBLEM!" AWARD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JUST SMILE FOR THE CAMERA, JUST SMILE FOR THE CAMERA AND THANK ME FOR ALL THAT I HAVE DONE FOR WOMEN.
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING FOR WOMEN.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SAYS ON MY "SCOTT BROWN MEMORIAL YOU'VE JUST DONE SOMETHING FOR WOMEN AWARD." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. CONGRATULATIONS.
