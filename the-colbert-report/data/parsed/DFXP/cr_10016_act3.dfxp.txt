Colbert: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE COFOUNDER OF THE ACADEMY WHICH TEACHES COMPUTER PROGRAMMING FOR FREE SO IF YOU BUY ONE OF THOSE BOOKS YOU ARE REALLY A DUMMY NOW. PLEASE WELCOME ZACH SIMS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: HEY, ZACH, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. LET ME GIVE THE PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR CV HERE. YOU WENT TO COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY?
YEP.
Colbert: NOT EASY TO GET INTO, RIGHT?
IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL. ALL RIGHT?  ANYBODY WOULD KILL FOR THAT, RIGHT?  YOU DROPPED OUT.
YEP.
Colbert: OKAY.
FEW PEOPLE WOULD DO THAT.
Colbert: FEWER PEOPLE WOULD DROP OUT. YOU DROPPED OUT TO CALLED CO ACADEMY, IT TEACHES PEOPLE HOW TO CODE PROGRAMS, CODE COMPUTERS, RIGHT?
YES.
Colbert: WHY?  WHY?  WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
WE THINK EVERYONE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF COMPUTING, WHAT THEY DO EVERY DAY IN THE REAL WORLD, INTERACT SO MUCH WITH TECHNOLOGY AND WE WANT TO TEACH EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND THAT.
Colbert: WHY DO I NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT, CAN'T I SAY SIRI DO A CODE FOR ME.
IF WE DID THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE SUCH PROBLEMS WITH --
Colbert: THE PRESIDENT SAID HE CALLED THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST FOR THAT, DID THEY CALL YOU?
NOT YET, I AM WAITING.
Colbert: YOU WOULD BE THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST. BUT WHY DO YOU THINK -- WHY DO YOU THINK EVERYBODY -- YOUR MISSION IS FREE, RIGHT?
YES.
Colbert: HOW DO YOU -- SO YOU HAVE THE SAME BUSINESS MODEL AS TWITTER. SO HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T, SO WE HAVE A LOT OF INVESTORS IN THE COMPANY AND EVENTUALLY WE ARE HOPING TO CONNECT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LEARNING ON THE SITE WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO WITH THEIR SKILL SET.
Colbert: I WOULD NOT SAY WE HAVE A LOT OF INVESTORS AND NOT MAKE MONEY IN THE SAME SENTENCE. OKAY, HOW WOULD IT HELP ME TO LEARN HOW TO CODE?
SO YOU HAVE A WEB SITE, RIGHT, YOU CAN CHANGE THIS TO, CHANGE YOUR WEB SITE AND BETTER INTERFACE WITH YOUR FANS AND WE THINK EVERYONE CAN BENEFIT BY LEARNING BASIC PROGRAMMING.
Colbert: IS THIS -- WHAT KIND OF LANGUAGES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?  BECAUSE THEY SAY THE OLDER YOU GET, THE HARDER IT IS TO LEARN A LANGUAGE, AND I AM IN BY LATE TWENTIES. WHAT LANGUAGES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
WE DO PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING, JAVASCRIPT, RUBY PYTHON, TO BUILD THINGS.
Colbert: EACH ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS SOMETHING --
HTML YOU HAVE HEARD OF.
Colbert: IT IS AN INTERNET THING. IT BUILDS WEB SITES AND OTHER THINGS. OKAY, HOW MANY PEOPLE USE THIS SITE?
AT THIS .10S OF MILLIONS.
Colbert: WOW.
YEAH.
Colbert: AND ALL OVER THE WORLD?
ALL OVER THE WORLD, IN EVERY COUNTRY OF THE WORLD.
Colbert: OKAY. WELL, WHY DO YOU LET THEM?  ARE THE CHINESE USING IT?
THE CHINESE ARE USING THIS.
Colbert: WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE USERS ARE CHINESE?
MUCH LESS THAN THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS.
Colbert: REALLY?  WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE CHINESE, SIR?  YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TELL ME NSA IS GOING TO BE ON YOUR ASS.
THEY KNOW, THOUGH.
Colbert: I AM SURE.
THEY KNOW EVERYTHING.
Colbert: EXACTLY. THEY HAVE PICTURES OF YOU SHOWERING. OKAY. BUT SHOULD WE BE LETTING COUNTRIES THAT ARE OUR LEAST ECONOMIC RIVALS LEARN THESE THINGS FOR FREE?  I MEAN, IF CODING IS REALLY IMPORTANT, AREN'T YOU A TRAITOR?
WE ARE IN A CYBER WAR.
WE ARE HOPING EVERYONE TO BECOME COMPETITIVE BY WORKING TOGETHER SO WE HAVE PEOPLE IN CHINA THAT ARE CREATING LESSONS AND PEOPLE IN THE U.S. ARE TAKING AND LEARNING FROM AND ALL GET BETTER TOGETHER. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPETITIVE.
Colbert: SO YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE WORLD, ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT KUMBAYA LET'S ALL HOLD HANDS AND CODE TOGETHER AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Colbert: SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OKAY. SO WHAT AM I GOING TO DO, I AM GOING TO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL SHOULD I DO WHAT YOU DO, YOU KNOW?  SHOULD I JUST DROP OUT, TURN ON AND LOG IN?  IS THERE ANY PURPOSE OF GOING TO COLLEGE OTHER THAN GETTING A HIGH PAYING JOB WHEN YOU COME OUT?  IS THERE AT THIS POSSIBLE REASON FOR HAVING A LIBERAL EDUCATION OTHER THAN CASH?
COLLEGE EDUCATION IS GOING TO HELP YOU LEARN THINGS AND INTRODUCE TO PEOPLE AROUND YOU AND IT IS REALLY EXPENSIVE SO WHAT PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR IS BRY, THEY ARE HOPING TO GET JOBS AFTERWARDS AND LETTING THEM DOWN AS A COUNTRY.
Colbert: THAT'S MY ROB WITH YOUR SITE IT IS FREE AND I BELIEVE THE PURPOSE OF GOING TO COLLEGE IS TO ACQUIRE CRIPPLING DEBT.
THEN THE SYSTEM IS WORKING.
Colbert: BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR ME SAY ON THIS SHOW WHO HAVE COLLEGE LOANS I KNOW WILL NEVER QUIT. NO MATTER HOW POORLY I TREAT THEM. SO LET'S SAY THAT THIS UTOPIAN FUTURE OF YOURS COMES ABOUT.
SURE.
Colbert: AND EVERYBODY LEARNS BLEEP, BLURP AND YOUR CODING THING WHAT WILL WE DO?  ALL JUST SITTING IN LIKE WINDOWLESS CUBICLES CODING MADDEN 3,000?  WHAT WILL AMERICA BE PRODUCING IF WE ARE ALL CODING?
I THINK EVERY I HAVE WILL CHANGE BASED ON PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING PROGRAMMING.
Colbert:.
YOU CAN SELL YOUR THINGS ONLINE AND TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY HAVE IN STOCK THAT DAY. UNDERSTAND HOW TO --
Colbert: WHAT DO YOUR PARENTS THINK OF THIS?
I THINK THEY ARE HAPPY.
Colbert: REALLY?  BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT WRITING THE CHECKS TO --
THAT IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST UPSIDE.
Colbert: UH-HUH.
THAT IS THE FACE I GOT FROM THEM. IT IS NOT THE BEST PICKUP LINE IN THE WORLD, HI I USED TO GO TO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL AND NOW I WORK FOR FREE.
YES, EVEN WORSE.
Colbert: IS CODING REALLY A JOB OR MORE LIKE A CALLING?  BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY IT IS LOGIC BASED WHICH IS LIKE MATH, I HAVE HEARD MATH IS LIKE MUSIC, IS A CALLING TO CODE, IS IT LIKE A CALLING TO PLAY THE PIANO?
I THINK YOU CAN BE BE GOOD WITH ANYTHING WITH A CALLING. AND I THINK PROGRAMMING --
Colbert: THIS IS A FLUKE.
I USED TO BE A TOLLBOOTH OPERATOR ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE AND ONE DAY JON STEWART DROPPED BY AND HE GOES MAY I NEED A CORRESPONDENT, GET IN MY CAR. ZACH SIMS, CODE ACADEMY, THANKS FOR JOINING ME. GET ONLINE. IT IS FREE. WE WILL BE RIGHT B
