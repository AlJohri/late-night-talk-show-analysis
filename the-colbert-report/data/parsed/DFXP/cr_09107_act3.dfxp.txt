GOOD, THANK YOU. Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW ALBUM  OUT HERE. IT'S CALLED TROUBLE WILL FIND  ME. ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU TEMPTING FATE WITH THE  NAME OF THIS? WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT TROUBLE  WILL FIND ME? HAVE YOU SEEN TROUBLE? HAVE YOU PAID YOUR DUES?
NOT THAT MUCH TROUBLE BUT  AVERAGE HUMAN TROUBLE, I GUESS. I THINK IT'S SORT OF...
Stephen: GOOD STORY. WE WERE GOING TO CALL IT  THAT. AVERAGE HUMAN TROUBLE.
Stephen: I LIKE THAT. THAT'S GOOD. IT FOUND ME. YOU GUYS FROM CINCINATTI. FROM CINCINATTI, DID YOU EAT THE  SPAGHETTI WITH THE CHILLY ON  TOP?

WE WERE DOING WELL. Stephen: YOU'RE GETTING THE  COLBERT BUMP TONIGHT.
WE'RE NOT THAT HIP THOUGH. Stephen: I DON'T THINK WE'RE  THAT... I'M.
I'M 42. Stephen: YOU CAN'T BE HIP  BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THAT FAR AWAY  FROM A HIP REPLACEMENT.
IT'S HARDER TO BE HIP. Stephen: GOOD TO KNOW. YOU GUYS HAVE A REPUTATION OF  PERFECTIONISTS. DID YOU REACH PERFECTION WITH  THIS ALBUM?
NO, NO. I THINK WE JUST TRY TO MAKE  IT... WE ALWAYS LIKE TRY TO MAKE  A RECORD THAT WILL LAST FOREVER.
Stephen: NOTHING BIG, JUST  FOREVER. SO BASICALLY JAMES JOYS'  ULYSSES, THIS ALBUM. WHAT DOES THE NATIONAL MEAN?
IT DOESN'T... THE NAME OF THE  BAND...
Stephen: WHAT, WHAT? IT WAS MEANT TO MEAN NOTHING. Stephen: MOVE ON. MOVE ON. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME  OR THESE PEOPLE'S TIME.
OKAY. Stephen: THAT'S NOT IT. THANK YOU. MATT BURNINGER, PLAY A SONG?
YEP. Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK  WITH A PERFORMANCE BY THE  NATIONALS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
