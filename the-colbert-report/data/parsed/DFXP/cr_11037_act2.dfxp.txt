(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. NATION, THIS WON'T COME AS A SURPRISE, BUT I SO DISLIKE NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN THAT, LET'S JUST SAY, I'M NOT GOING TO NAME MY NEXT CHILD AFTER THE GUY. AND EVIDENTLY NEITHER IS ANYONE ELSE.
THERE IS ONLY ONE KIM JONG-UN IN NORTH KOREA. THAT'S A LAW. BY DIRECTIVE OF THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME, THE NAME KIM JONG-UN IS OFF LIMITS TO ANY OTHER CITIZENS OF THE SECRETIVE AND REPRESSIVE STATE. BIRTH CERTIFICATES WITH THE NAMES KIM JONG-UN ARE REJECTED AND ANYONE WHO HAPPENS TO SHARE THE SUPREME LEADER'S NAME MUST CHANGE IT.
Stephen: OH, YOU GOTTA DO IT. BECAUSE WHEN THE AVERAGE NORTH KOREAN SEES THE HEADLINE "KIM JONG-UN INSPECTS LOCAL LUBE FACTORY," YOU DON'T WANT THEM WONDERING, "IS THAT KIM JONG-UN, THE FARMER FROM DOWN THE ROAD, OR KIM JONG-UN THE DICTATOR WHO KILLED THAT FARMER FOR HAVING THE SAME NAME?" POINT IS, YOU DO NOT WANT TO CROSS THIS GUY. CONSIDER WHAT'S HAPPENING TO SONY OVER THEIR UPCOMING MOVIE "THE INTERVIEW," STARRING JAMES FRANCO AND TONIGHT'S GUEST SETH ROGEN. (CHEERING) THEY PLAY TV JOURNALISTS RECRUITED BY THE C.I.A. TO ASSASSINATE KIM JONG-UN,  I ASSUME BY SMOKING POT AT HIM. APPARENTLY, OL' SOURPUSS HERE DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR WHEN IT COMES TO HIS OWN ASSASSINATION.
A HUGE HACK ATTACK ROCKING A MAJOR HOLLYWOOD STUDIO. WHEN THE TRAILER FOR "THE INTERVIEW" CAME OUT, NORTH KOREA CALLED THE MOVIE AN ACT OF WAR. NOW SONY PICTURES, THE STUDIO BEHIND THE FILM, HAS BEEN HACKED.
HACKERS HAVE STOLEN FIVE NEW MOVIES AND LEAKED THEM ON TO THE INTERNET.
EXPERTS SAY SONY WILL LIKELY LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THIS HOLIDAY SEASON FROM PEOPLE VIEWING ILLEGAL DOWNLOADS OF THOSE MOVIES ONLINE RATHER THAN GOING TO THEATERS.
HACKERS WORKING FOR NORTH KOREA COULD BE BEHIND THE ATTACK.
Stephen: YES, SOMEONE HACKED SONY AND ILLEGALLY DISTRIBUTED MOVIES ON THE INTERNET. IT HAS TO BE NORTH KOREA. THE ONLY OTHER PERSON WITH THAT CAPABILITY IS A 12-YEAR-OLD WITH BIT TORRENT. (LAUGHTER) THE HACKERS ALSO LEAKED UNRELEASED SCRIPTS, INCLUDING THE SCRIPT FOR "MALL COP: BLART2 "  -- WHAT?! THAT MOVIE HAS A SCRIPT?! GREAT. THEY JUST RUINED THE ENTIRE PLOT -- LARGE MAN FALLS DOWN! EH, I'LL STILL SEE IT. THE HACKERS EVEN LEFT A CALLING CARD -- "HACKED BY GOP ." WHICH IS ALSO WHAT MITCH McCONNELL YELLS EVERY TIME HE SUCCESSFULLY WORKS HIS MICROWAVE. (LAUGHTER) IN THIS CASE, THE G.O.P. ACTUALLY STANDS FOR GUARDIANS OF PEACE, AND THEY'RE DEMANDING THAT SONY CANCEL RELEASE OF "THE INTERVIEW." OR AS THEY POSTED ONLINE, "DO CARRY OUT OUR DEMAND IF YOU WANT TO ESCAPE US. AND STOP IMMEDIATELY SHOWING THE MOVIE OF TERRORISM. YOU, SONY AND F.B.I. CANNOT FIND US. WE ARE PERFECT AS MUCH." YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHICH IS EITHER A THREAT OR DIALOGUE FROM THE BLART2 SCRIPT. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS WHOLE THING WORRIES ME BECAUSE, OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS, I'VE SAID SOME TERRIBLE THINGS THAT COULD MAKE THIS GUY "UN"-HAPPY. NATION, I'M NO FAN OF KOREAN DICTATOR AND EVIL POTATO KIM JONG-UN. THIS PHOTO OF KIM JONG-UN -- IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE THE MUSHROOMS END AND HIS HAIRCUT BEGINS. DEAR LEADER KIM JONG-UN HAS FINALLY RE-EMERGED IN PUBLIC AFTER A COURAGEOUS BATTLE WITH STAGE 5 CHEESE ANKLE. (LAUGHTER) I STAND BY ALL OF THAT. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THE HACKERS TARGETING INNOCENT AMERICANS -- NORTH KOREA IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. AND KIM JONG-UN. OH, HE IS PERFECT AS MUCH. LET SHINE HIS RAIDIANT GLOW UPON ALL HIS CHILDREN, FROM THE FROZEN STEPPES OF THE NORTH TO THE FROZEN MUDFLATS OF THE SOUTH. ALL OF AMERICA BOWS BEFORE THE GLORIOUS KIM JONG-UN. TRULY, HE IS AS WISE AS HE HAS CHIN. WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL INTERVIEW THE LIE-PEDALING FILMMAKER BEHIND "THE INTERVIEW" -- DECADENT CAPITALIST PIG AND ENEMY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC, SETH ROGEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
