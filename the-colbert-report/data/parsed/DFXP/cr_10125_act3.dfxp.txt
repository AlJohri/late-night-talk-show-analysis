[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS MY ARCH NEMESIS. PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSWOMAN ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. YOU AND I HAVE BEEN ENEMIES LONG ENOUGH THAT I THINK WE'RE ALMOST FRIENDS AT THIS POINT.
NOT QUITE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. YOU REPRESENT THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WHERE YOU ARE A NON-VOTING MEMBER. I WANT TO THANK YOU IN JOINING YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN NON-VOTING FOR ANY LEGISLATION. [APPLAUSE]
THE DIFFERENCE IS THEY CAN VOTE AND STILL WON'T VOTE FOR ANY LEGISLATION.
Stephen: BUT IT'S ADMIRABLE RESTRAINT ON THEIR BEHALF. YOU'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF WHAT'S CALLED FREEDOM SUMMER IN MISSISSIPPI. TELL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT FREEDOM SUMMER WAS AND THE ROLE YOU PLAYED IN IT.
WELL, FREEDOM SUMMER WAS WHEN A LARGE NUMBER, ACTUALLY THOUSANDS, OF STUDENTS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY CAME TO MISSISSIPPI TO TRY TO HELP MISSISSIPPIANS WHO WERE KEPT FROM VOTING LEARN HOW TO VOTE AND TO GET THEM TO THE POLLS.
Stephen: OKAY. WHY WOULDN'T THEY JUST REGISTER? I UNDERSTAND THAT ONLY 10% OF BLACK VOTERS IN MISSISSIPPI IN 1964 WERE REGISTERED BEFORE YOU AND OTHER FREEDOM RIDERS WENT DOWN THERE TO HELP THEM REGISTER. AND YET THEY WERE HALF THE POPULATION, SO WHAT'S UP? STEPHEN: YEAH, WHAT UP IS MY QUESTION.
WHAT WAS UP IS THEY WOULDN'T LET THEM VOTE. THEY WOULDN'T LET THEM REGISTER.
Stephen:  WHO IS THEY? THE MAN? ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE MAN?
THE MEN.
Stephen: THE MEN. OKAY. WELL YOU WERE A STUDENT AT YALE LAW SCHOOL AT THE TIME.
YEP.
Stephen: OKAY. WHEN YOU FIRST CAME DOWN IN 1963, MEDGAR EVERS MET YOU AT THE BUS STATION. TELL THE YOUNG PEOPLE HERE AGAIN WHO MEDGAR EVERS WAS AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM THAT SUMMER.
MEDGAR EVERS WAS A MARTYR OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. MEDGAR EVERS WAS THE HEAD OF THE NAACP IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. MISSISSIPPI WAS AT THAT POINT SO FAR BEHIND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY THAT IT HAD NOT EVEN HAD SIT-INS, THINGS WHERE WE USED TO SIT IN AND SAY WE'RE ENTITLED TO HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE. THEY HADN'T EVEN HAD THOSE. HE HAD TO LEAD THOSE. AND THERE WERE VERY FEW LAWYERS, MUCH LESS LAW STUDENTS LIKE ME, SO WHEN I CAME, HE WANTED ME TO REMAIN IN JACKSON, WHEREAS I HAD PROMISED TO GO TO THE DELTA, WHICH WAS THE HEART OF THE WORST PART OF MISSISSIPPI WHERE PEOPLE COULDN'T VOTE. HE PUT ME ON A BUS AFTER SHOWING ME AROUND JACKSON ALL DAY, WENT HOME AND WAS SHOT IN THE BACK. MARTYR OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.
Stephen: AND THAT'S YOUR FIRST DAY IN MISSISSIPPI.
VERY FIRST DAY.
Stephen: YOU WENT BACK AGAIN THE NEXT YEAR.
WELL, NEXT YEAR WAS THE MISSISSIPPI FREEDOM SUMMER. ACTUALLY, WHAT I WAS DOING IN THE DELTA THE YEAR BEFORE WAS THE PROTOTYPE FOR THE MISSISSIPPI FREEDOM SUMMER WHEN THE STUDENTS WERE GOING TO COME DOWN. THE QUESTION IS: WHAT ARE THE STUDENTS GOING TO DO. THEY'RE GOING TO DO WORKSHOPS.
Stephen: OUTSIDE AGITATE I BELIEVE IS THE TECHNICAL TERM. DON'T GET ME WRONG. AGAIN, I'M NOT THE MONSTER HERE. BUT SHOULDN'T IT BE UP TO INDIVIDUAL STATES AS TO HOW EASY OR HARD IT IS FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO VOTE? [LAUGHTER] DOESN'T THE 10th AMENDMENT GUARANTEE THAT TO THE STATES?
STEPHEN, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE 14th AMENDMENT?
Stephen: I HAVE NOT. NO, I HAVE NOT. NO. I DON'T THINK IT GOES THAT HIGH. [APPLAUSE] I DON'T THINK IT ACTUALLY GOES THAT HIGH. [LAUGHTER] WHAT'S THE 14th AMENDMENT?
EVERYBODY HAS TO BE TREATED EQUALLY.
Stephen: OKAY.
EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO VOTING.
Stephen: I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.
DUH.
Stephen: OKAY. WE'RE APPROACHING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE 1964 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. AND TODAY IN CONGRESS THIS HAPPENED. THIS IS SEVERAL MEMBERS OF CONGRESS JOINING ARMS SINGING "WE SHALL OVERCOME." ♪ WE SHALL LIVE IN PEACE WE SHALL LIVE IN PEACE ♪♪
Stephen: WAS IT WORTH ALL THIS EFFORT AND ALL THIS SUFFERING TO SEE TEX DEPRESSION ON MITCH McCONNELL AND JOHN BOEHNER'S FACE WHEN THEY SANG THAT SONG?
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD LAUGH AT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS JOINING US IN SINGING "WE SHALL OVERCOME."
Stephen: I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU THAT MITCH McCONNELL AND JOHN BOEHNER ARE NOT SINGING. THEY ARE HOLDING HANDS AND SWAYING IN AGONY. [LAUGHTER]
THEY DIDN'T... THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW THE WORDS, STEPHEN.
Stephen: THE WORDS, JIM, GO FIND THIS FOOTAGE, BECAUSE IT'S IN THE SAME THING, GO BACK ABOUT 30 SECOND, BECAUSE THE WORDS ARE ON A GIANT PROMPTER ROLLING. I [BLEEPED] YOU NOT. THEY ARE. I PROMISE YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'LL WAIT. I DON'T CARE HOW LONG THIS SHOW GOES. IT'S ON A PROMPTER IN THE BACKGROUND.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM THEM?
Stephen: I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FROM THEM. [LAUGHTER] NOW, HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU GUYS END UP REGISTERING THAT SUMMER?
I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER WITH ME, STEPHEN. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: IT'S CABLE. MAKE IT UP. [APPLAUSE] ALL I'M SAYING IS... ALL I'M SAYING IS YOU MUST HAVE SIGNED UP A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAD COCHRAN, THE BLACK VOTE SWAYED THE VOTE. IT SWUNG THE ELECTION IN MISSISSIPPI. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT RIGHT NOW AND APOLOGIZE TO CHRIS McDANIEL?
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY TO THOSE WHO WENT TO THE POLLS, THOSE AFRICAN AMERICANS, YOU SURE KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH THE VOTE. WE WENT TO GET FOR YOU IN 1964. THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
STEPHEN: CONGRESSWOMAN ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME, MADAM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
