Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU CAN FEEL THE ENERGY IN THE ROOM, I KNOW THESE PEOPLE CAME TO FIGHT FOR WHAT'S RIGHT (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS, I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU ALL HAD A GREAT WEEKEND. I DID. I WAS IN VATICAN CITY FOR A LITTLE SAINT-MAKING FESTIVAL CALLED POPECHELLA (LAUGHTER) JUST LIKE COACHELLA, IT HAD A PARTY ATMOSPHERE AND A LACK OF CONTRACEPTION. (LAUGHTER) EVERY ONE WAS THERE TO CELEBRATE ONE THING, TWO THINGS. (LAUGHTER)
JIM?
SOME CALLED IT THE DAY OF FOUR POPES, POPE FRANCIS AND HIS PREDECESSOR BENEDICT XVI AT THE CEREMONY THIS MORNING WERE TWO GIANTS OF THE CHURCH, JOHN PAUL II AND JOHN XXIII WERE DECLARED SAINTS.
IT IS AN EVENT THAT MAY WELL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. IN EFFECT FOUR POPES IN THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT THERE NO SO MANY POPES YOU COULD NOT SWING A DEAD POPE WITHOUT HITTING ONE. NOW KNOW SURPRISE THESE GUYS WERE SAINTED. JOHN XXIII'S MODERNIZED THE CHURCH, SECOND VATICAN COUNCIL AND JOHN PAUL II FOUGHT AGAINST COMMUNISM BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WAS AN HONORARY HARLEM GLOBETROTTER. (APPLAUSE)
AND I BELIEVE-- I BELIEVE-- I BELIEVE THAT THEIR UNDEFEATED RECORD IS THE REAL MIRACLE. (LAUGHTER)
AND FOLKS, WHEN YOU ARE THERE, IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN, BUT IT FELT AS IF THESE DEPARTED POPES WERE IN ST. PETER'S SQUARE WITH YOU BECAUSE PARTS OF THEM WERE.
POPE FRANCIS HAD RELICS FROM EACH OF THE PONTIFFS.
THE RELIC OF JOHN XXIII IS A PIECE OF HIS SKIN. AND THE RELIC OF JOHN PAUL II IS HIS BLOOD IN A VIAL.
Stephen: SKIN AND BLOOD, WHY WOULD THE VATICAN WANT-- THEY'RE BUILDING A FRANKEN-POPE! (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) FOLKS IT WAS A MONUMENTAL DAY THAT BROUGHT ALL CATHOLICS TOGETHER. LUCKILY THE NEWS MEDIA WAS THERE TO HELP DRIVE US APART.
WE HAVE TWO MEN WHO ARE OFTEN SEEN AS SORT OF PARAGONS ONE, JOHN XXIII AS SORT OF THE LIBERAL WING OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE OTHER ONE POPE JOHN PAUL II SEEN AS SORT OF THE CONSERVATIVE.
TWO VERY DIFFERENT POPES. ONE LIBERAL AND ONE CONSERVATIVE.
ONE VIEWED AS A LIBERAL ICON AND ONE AS A CONSERVATIVE ICON.
Stephen: THANK GOODNESS WITH ALL THE LOVE TALK THIS WEEKEND I WAS AFRAID THAT WE WILL FORGET THAT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD MUST BE DIVIDED INTO LIBERAL OR CONSERVATIVE. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN WE ALL KNOW JUDAS WAS A LIBERAL AND CLEARLY GOD'S A CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE HE'S PRETTY RELIGIOUS. BUT DESPITE THE POPE'S INFALLIBILITY IN ALL THINGS RELIGIOUS, I CAN'T HELP BUT FEELING YOU GOT SOMETHING WRONG HERE.
TWO MIRACLES ARE REQUIRED FOR SAINTHOOD. BUT POPE FRANCIS WAIVED THAT REQUISITE FOR POPE JOHN XXIII SEEN HERE ON THE LEFT. AND THE CANONIZATION PROCESS FOR POPE JOHN PAUL 2nd ON THE RIGHT AS YOU SEE HERE BEGAN PRIOR TO THE NORMAL FIVE YEAR WAITING PERIOD.
Stephen: THAT IS WRONG. WE CANNOT LOWER OUR STANDARDS FOR CANONIZATION I MEANS THAT'S HOW SAINT IDES GOT IN. IF THERE ARE NO STANDARDS, EVERYTHING GOES TO HELL, FIRST YOU DON'T NEED TWO MIRACLES TO BECOME A SAINT. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, EVERYONE AT THE VATICAN IS WEARING DENIM ON CASUAL GOOD FRIDAY. (APPLAUSE)
NATION YOU KNOW I PRIDE MYSELF ON HAVING THE BALLS TO SAY THINGS OTHER WILL NOT. (APPLAUSE) AND I KNOW-- AND I KNOW, I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO RUFFLE SOME FEATHERS BUT I'M AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASE. I DON'T CARE HOW MANY SPONSORS THAT COSTS ME. YOUR CHOLERA SOAKED MONEY IS NO GOOD HERE CADILLAC. THAT'S WHY I EXPERIENCED SEVERE INFLAMMATION OF MY RAGE GLAND WHEN I HEARD THIS.
THE POLIO-LIKE ILLNESS HAS INFECTED AS MANY AS 20 KIDS IN CALIFORNIA.
CONCERN ABOUT A GROWING OUTBREAK OF WHOOPING COUGH.
HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE REPORTING MORE CASES OF MUMPS IN OHIO.
DESPITE MEASLES WAS CONSIDERED WIPED OUT HERE IN THE U.S. 14 YEARS AGO, WE'RE SEEING A RESURGENCE OF THIS HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS BUT PREVENTABLE DISEASE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: YES, THESE DISEASES ARE MAKING A COMEBACK. LIKE AEROSMITH IN THE 1990s. WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN THE SPREAD OF SOME DISEASE. (LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, THESE ARE ALL DISEASES WE HAVE VACCINES FOR. I MEAN WHO KNOWS WHY THESE VACCINES ARE NO LONGER EFFECTIVE. I MEAN HAVE THE PATHOGENS EVOLVED. ARE THE DOSES NOW TOO SMALL. WHY, SCIENCE?
THE MAIN REASON IS THAT MORE AND MORE PARENTS ARE CHOOSING NOT TO GET THEIR KIDS VACCINATED.
Stephen: OKAY, THAT WOULD DO IT. YOU GOT TO DO THE THING. OKAY, YOU KNOW, YOU SEE, BACK IN--  (APPLAUSE)
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED, BACK IN THE 90s DOCTORS STARTED GIVING INFANTS MORE VACCINES SOME OF WHICH CONTAINED A PRESERVATIVE CALLED THIMEROSAL WHICH CONTAINED MERCURY AND THE RATE OF AUTISM INCREASED DRAMATICALLY WHICH CAUSED MANY PARENTS AND CELEBRITIES TO FEAR KIDS WERE GETTING AUTISM FROM THE VACCINE. AND MERCURY IS BAD FOR YOUR BRAIN. WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I USED TO LOVE THOSE GLASS PICKIE STICKS MY MOM WOULD GIVE ME WHEN I WAS SICK. FOLKS, THIS ANTI-VAX MOVEMENT HAS DONE A LOT OF THINGS THAT I LOVE. STAR POWER, SCIENCE DENIAL AND HIPSTER APPEAL. BECAUSE PENNY FARTHINGS AND HANDLEBAR MUSTACHES ARE COOL BUT NOTHING IS MORE VINTAGE THAN DYING OF RUBELLA. THE POINT IS THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO FEAR VACCINES HERE TO TELL US WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE VACCINE EDUCATION CENTER AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA DR. PAUL OFFIT, DR. OFFIT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL RIGHT, OKAY. LET'S GET TO IT. 29% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM. BUT APPARENTLY YOU SCIENTISTS THINK YOU KNOW BETTER, OKAY. DON'T PARENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE THE DECISION FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN ALONE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM?
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, THEY'RE NOT MAKING THE DECISION FOR THEIR CHILDREN ALONE. WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO PUT YOUR CHILD AT RISK OF GETTING A VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASE  YOU'RE ALSO PUTTING EVERYONE WHO THEY COME IN CONTACT AT RISK.
THOSE PEOPLE CAN GET VACCINES.
BUT OFTEN THEY TOO, THOSE CHILDREN TOO HAVE A PARENT THAT IS CHOOSING NOT TO VACCINATE.
Stephen: WELL THAT IS THE CHOICE OF THE PARENT, THE PARENT KNOWS BEST FOR THE CHILD.
BUT DO THEY.
Stephen: YES THEY DO, OKAY. THEY DO.
IF A PARENT KNOWS IF A PARENT IS NOT GETTING A VACCINE FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE THEY FEAR AS YOU ELUDED TO EARLIER THAT IT IS CAUSING AUTISM THEN WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS JUST PUTTING ASIDE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT, A MOUNTAIN OF SCIENCE. THERE IS NOW MORE THAN 20 STUDIES THAT SHOW  VACCINES DON'T CAUGHT AUTISM. THE MMR DIDN'T CAUGHT AUTISM.  THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP.
Stephen: BUT 29% OF AMERICANS STILL BELIEVE THAT, SURELY THEY ARE AT LEAST 29% RIGHT.
POPULAR BELIEF IS NOT ALWAYS POPULAR WISDOM. THERE ARE MANY THINGS ONE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT AUTISM WHAT YOU DO KNOW IS THAT VACCINES DON'T CAUSE IT.
BUT THERE IS, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE AMOUNT OF VACCINATION GIVEN TO YOUNG CHILDREN INCREASED IN THE 90s. AND THE DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM ROSE AT THE SAME TIME. THAT'S A COROLLARY AFFECT, OKAY. IT IS THE SAME WAY THAT THE IPHONE IS INTRODUCED AND WORLD WAR II VETS START DYING. (LAUGHTER)
IN THE SAME DECADE. IT'S GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER.
YOU KNOW ITS PERFECTLY REASONABLE FOR THE PARENT TO ASK THE QUESTION. MY CHILD WAS FINE, THEY GOT A VACCINE, NOW THEY AREN'T FINE, IT IS AN ANSWERABLE QUESTION, IT HAS BEEN ANSWERED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE QUESTION IS WHY IS THE 29% STILL THINK THAT VACCINES MAY BE A PROBLEM. WHEN THEY ARE SHOWN NOT TO BE.
YOU HEAD UP SOMETHING CALLED THE VACCINE EDUCATION CENTER. THE FACT THAT WE NEED A VACCINE EDUCATION CENTER DOESN'T IT MEAN YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST THE FIGHT? BECAUSE I MEAN IF YOU ARE RIGHT, VACCINES ARE SO GREAT, WHY DO WE NEED TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT IT.
WE SHOULDN'T BE. I MEAN THEIR RECORDS SHOULD STAND ON THEIR OWN. IN THE 1920s DIPTHERIA WAS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON  KILLERS OF TEENAGERS. IN THE 50s POLIO RAVAGED AMERICAN CHILDREN CAUSING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CASES OF PARALYSIS. MEASLES BEFORE THE VACCINE IN 1963 CAUSED 48,000 CHILDREN TO BE HOSPITALIZED AND 500 TO DIE. NOW WE LARGELY DON'T SEE THOSE, THEY ARE STARTING TO COME BACK A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE PARENTS ARE MAKING THESE CHOICES BECAUSE THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THESE DISEASE, NOT ONLY HAD WE LARGELY ELIMINATED THEM BUT WE ELIMINATED THE MEMORY SO PEOPLE AREN'T SCARED. UNFORTUNATELY THEY MAY HAVE TO GET SCARED OF THEM AGAIN, WHICH IS SAD.
Stephen: WHAT IF I WERE TO TELL YOU SOUND LIKE YOU ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG PHARMA. THEY MAKE THE INOCULATIONS, THEY ARE MAKING MONEY, GREASING YOUR PALMS THAT IS OUT THERE NOW, RESPOND TO IT.
YEAH, SO--  (APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT WE JUST KEEP KNOCKING BIG PHARMA WHEN IN FACT YOU CAN'T ON THE ONE HAND PRAISE THE FACT THAT THESE VACCINES HAVE SAVED THEIR LIVES, HAVE ALLOWED OUR CHILDREN TO LIVE LONGER, BETTER, HEALTHIER LIVES AND THEN SAY THAT JUST DISMISS THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE IT, THAT MAKE THESE VACCINES SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. IF YOU WANT TO-- IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE LONGER BETTER HEALTHIER LIVES CARD, THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO WELL, DOCTOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. DR. PAUL OFFIT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
