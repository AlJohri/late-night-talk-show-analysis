Stephen: QUOAL BACK,  EVERYBODY. WE'RE AT THE CLINTON GLOBAL  INITIATIVE UNIVERSITY WITH THE  NAMESAKE PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. SIR, THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN  ACCOMPLISH NOW THAT YOU WERE NOT  ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN YOU WERE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? DOES THE CGI GIVE YOU A FREEDOM  YOU DIDN'T HAVE AS PRESIDENT?
WELL IN SOME WAYS. THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT  YOU HAVE MORE POWER BUT ALSO  SUBJECT TOLL DAILY EVENTS. THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO RESPOND TO  WHAT HAS HAPPENED.
Stephen: I KNOW WHAT DAILY  EVENTS ARE.
WHEN YOU ARE OUT OF OFFICE,  SINCE NOBODY IS GOING TO CALL  YOU AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING TO DEAL WITH AN EMERGENCY, YOU CAN  JUST DEAL WITH SOMETHING YOU  CHOOSE AND YOU CAN GET INTO REAL  DEBT. IF I GO, FOR EXAMPLE, I HAVE  THESE AGRICULTURAL PROJECTS IN  RWANDA AND MALAWI AND I CAN GO OUT ON REMOTE COUNTRY ROADS AND  SEE THEM, SEE HOW THEY ARE  WORKING, TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EFFECTED BY THEM. WHEN I WAS PRESIDENT, I MAYBE  GOT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT  ONCE WHEN I VISITED UGANDA AND I TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT OF  UGANDA INTO GOING DOWN A LONG  PATH WAY TO A SCHOOL AND VILLAGE TO SEAT AID PROGRAMS. YOU DON'T DO THAT AS PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE MORE TIME TO DIG INTO  THE DETAILS SO YOU CAN HAVE A  BIGGER IMPACT IN A NARROWER FIELD WHEN YOU LEAVE. THAT'S IMPORTANT.
Stephen: NOW, THE WAY YOU  DESCRIBE THE THINGS YOU DO AND  THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO AND THE WAY YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THE  WORLD, I SOUNDS HAVE GOOD BUT I  LISTEN TO A LOT OF RIGHT WING RADIO AND I KNOW THERE'S NOTHING  THAT YOU AND MRS. CLINTON DO  THAT DOESN'T HAVE AN ANGLE. YOU ARE ALWAYS HUNGRY FOR POWER. WHAT IS THE GRIST HERE IN  HELPING PEOPLE? WHAT IS THE OTHER THING, YOUR  SECRET PLAN HERE? BECAUSE EVERYONE WOULD DO IT IF  IT WAS JUST A GOOD THING TO DO  BUT THEY DON'T. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE ME  MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE? IS THERE SOMETHING OR JUST ITS  OWN REWARD?
IT'S TOTALLY SELFISH.
Stephen: IS THAT SELFISH  AND SELFLESS ARE THE SAME THING?
NO, I DO IT BECAUSE I'M GOOD  AT IT. I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO PLAY GOLF  ON THE SENIOR TOUR AND DO PLAY  MY SAXOPHONE AS MUCH AS I USED TO SO I DON'T LIKE TO DO IT IN  PUBLIC AND I MAKES ME HAPPY. I DO IT BECAUSE I THINK BACK TO  THE LIFE I'VE BEEN GIVEN BY THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE, I'D BE KIND OF A SLUG IF I DIDN'T DO IT. SHOULD DO IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- I MEAN, I SHOULD DO IT. IF YOU'VE HAD THE LIFE I'VE HAD  AND PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN YOU WHAT  THEY'VE GIVEN ME, --
Stephen: I'M AGREEING WITH  YOU AND THAT'S DANGEROUS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'M ABOUT TO GET YOU. YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M JUST DOING  WHAT I SHOULD DO IT AND IT MAKES  ME HAPPY.
Stephen: HOW WOULD YOU  COMPARE SOMETHING LIKE THE CGI  TO OTHER BIG GROUPS THAT GET TOGETHER LIKE DAVOS TED TALKS OR  BURNING MAN? WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  THIS AND THOSE OTHER GATHERINGS?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER HERE IS  THAT HERE SERVE EXPECTED TO MAKE  A COMMITMENT. AT THE CGI MEETING WHICH IS  CHEAPER THAN DAVOS BUT LESS FUN. YOU DON'T SKI BUMP UP OR SO MANY  GLOBAL C.E.O.S OR FORTUNE 500.
Stephen: DOES BONO GO TO  THAT ONE?
HE COMES SOMETIMES BUT HE IS  A COMMITMENT MAKER AND DOER. EVERYBODY HERE HAS TO MAKE A  COMMITMENT AND KEEP IT. WHEN I STARTED THE CGI I HAD NO  EARTHLY IDEA IF IT WOULD SUCCEED  OR FAIL. YOU ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO PAY  MONEY AT THE OPENING OF U.N. IN  NEW YORK CITY WHEN THE TRAFFIC IS TERRIBLE TO SIT AND TALK WITH  OTHER ERNEST DO GOODERS TO USE  CHELSEA'S PHRASE AND PROMISE TO DO SOMETHING THAT WILL COST THEM  MORE MONEY OR MORE TIME. AND KNOWING IF THEY DON'T KEEP  THEIR COMMITMENT THEY CAN'T COME  BACK. IT SEEMS LIKE A FOOL'S ERRAND. I TURNED OUT A FAIR NUMBER WERE  WILLING TO DO SOMETHING.
Stephen: HAVE YOU DONE TED  TALKS?
I HAVE AND I LIKE THEM.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER  THOUGHT OF HAVING THE CLINTON  GLOBAL INITIATIVE AND TED TALKS TEAM UP TO MAKE BILL AND TED'S  CORRECT INITIATIVE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THINK ABOUT IT.
THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA.
Stephen: WE WILL BE RIGHT  BACK WITH BILL CLINTON. STICK AROUND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
