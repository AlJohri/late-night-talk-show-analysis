Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS THE FOUNDER OF PAY PAL, TESLA AND SPACE X. I ON THE OTHER HAND ENJOY PIE. PLEASE WELCOME ELON MUSK. ELAN THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: NOW I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU THE EXCITEMENT I GET OVER THE THINGS YOU DO. ALL RIGHT. TELL PEOPLE, ARE YOU ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF PAY PAL. YOU'RE A SCIENTIST, YOU'RE AN INVENTOR. YOU CREATED THE INITIAL CONCEPT FOR SOLAR CITY, LARGEST PROVIDER OF SOLAR POWER IN THE UNITED STATES, SPACE X, TESLA AND PAY PAL, ALSO DESIGNED SOMETHING CALLED THE HYPERLOOP WHICH CAN TRANSPORT RIDERS FROM L.A. TO SAN FRANCISCO IN 35 MINUTES. AT WHAT POINT--  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AT WHAT POINT DO YOU TIP OVER FROM VISIONARY TO SUPERVILLAIN? (LAUGHTER) AND WHERE ARE YOU BUILDING YOUR SECRET MOUNTAIN LAIR.
I'M WONDERING THAT MYSELF, ACTUALLY.
Stephen: WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU IS THAT YOU SAW THE FUTURE AS A KID, I IMAGINE, AND SAID YEAH, LET'S MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
YEAH.
Stephen: BECAUSE THE FUTURE YOU'RE GIVING US IS THE FUTURE THAT I SAW, I SAW X-MEN ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND WHEN I WALKED OUT TO MY TESLA BECAUSE I HAVE A TESLA. AND IT JUST, IT JUST-- THE DOOR HANDLE CAME OUT, AND I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS MY FRIEND. I SAID I DON'T NEED THE DAMN MOVIE, I'VE GOT A CAR.
YEAH, WE KIND OF WANT THE CAR TO BE YOUR FRIEND, ACTUALLY. IN FACT, WITH THE NEW VERSION OF SOFTWARE COMING OUT YOU WILL GET TO BE ABLE TO NAME YOUR CAR. LIKE IT'S A PET OR SOMETHING.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOU NAME YOUR CAR.
WELL, I ACTUALLY, SINCE I HAVE THE ADVANCED SOFTWARE, I HAVE NAMED MY CAR. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH, I NAMED IT OLD FAITHFUL
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. DON'T NAME IT OLD YELLER  OR YOU'LL HAVE TO SHOOT IT
RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT SPACE X FOR A SECOND. PEOPLE KNOW YOU ALREADY FROM TESLA. I WANT TO SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF FOOTAGE HERE OF ONE OF THE TEST FLIGHTS YOU HAVE DONE FOR REUSABLE ROCKETS.
OKAY.
Stephen: THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST BAD ASS THINGS I HAVE EVER SEEN. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT, THAT IS WHAT WE WERE TOLD ROCKETS WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO WHEN I WAS READING ALL OF THOSE '50s SCIENCE FICTION BOOKS AS A KID.
THAT IS WHAT THEY SHOULD DO.
Stephen: WHY IS THAT SO IMPORTANT.
THE MAIN THING THAT IT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE  FULL REUSABILITY WITH ROCKETS. THE WAY ROCKETS WORK TODAY, THEY ARE SINGLE USE. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IF YOU HAD AN AIRCRAFT OR CAR THAT WAS SINGLE USE, NOT MANY PEOPLE WOULD USE IT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE. SO WE NEED TO MAKE THE ROCKETS COMPLETELY REUSABLE SUCH THAT YOU JUST NEED TO RELOAD PROPELLANT TO FLY AGAIN.
Stephen: THIS SEEMS TO ME IS THE KIND OF ROCKET WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO TO MARS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO THERE AND BUILD ANOTHER ROCKET. YOU HAVE TO LAND, SUCK SOME HYDROGEN OUT OF THE WATER AND SOIL, PACK IT BACK IN AND OFF YOU GO.
YES. ACTUALLY, YOU COULD CONCEIVABLY GO TO MARS WITH AN EXPANDABLE SYSTEM. BUT YOU WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO SPEND SEND A FEW PEOPLE MAYBE ON ONE OR TWO MISSIONS AND IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY ESTABLISH A MARS BASE, THAT IS WHERE THE REUSABILITY IS CRITICAL OTHERWISE IT IS SIMPLY TOO EXPENSIVE. PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO MOVE THERE.
Stephen: SO MORE IMMEDIATELY THAN GOING TO MARS, WE'VE GOT TO GET UP TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.
YES.
Stephen: AND THE RUSKIES SAID NO MORE RIDES FOR YOU, AMERICANSKIES.
I BELIEVE RUSSIA SAID AMERICA SHOULD USE A TRAMPOLINE TO GET THERE. NO JOKE. THEY DID SAY THAT, KIND OF CRAZY.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE ONLY COMPANY ACTUALLY SENDING PAYLOADS UP TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION RIGHT NOW. THE ONLY PRIVATE COMPANY DOING THAT. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE COMPANY THAT IS DOING THAT.
SPACE X AND THEN-- ORBITAL SCIENCES IS OUR COMPETITOR FOR-- THEY ALSO TAKE CARGO TO THE SPACE STATION.
Stephen: SO OF TWO YOU ARE DOING IT.
YES, ALTHOUGH WE'RE THE ONLY COMPANY THAT BRINGS STUFF BACK IN TERMS OF CARGO BACK.
Stephen: SO IF I WERE GOING TO GO UP, I WOULD WANT TO GO WITH YOU GUYS.
YES, IF YOU WANT THE RETURN JOURNEY.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT A ONE WAY TICKET.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Stephen: NOW THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE SAID THEY'RE TO THE GOING TO GIVE US RIDES ANY MORE, HOW GOOD IS THAT FOR YOU. CAN YOU STEP UP AND TAKE OVER FOR ITS MANNED FLIGHTS?
I MEAN, ARGUABLY, WITH ENEMIES LIKE THAT, WHO NEEDS FRIENDS. BUT YEAH, I SUPPOSE RUSSIA IS BEING HELPFUL, YEAH-- .
Stephen: DID YOU THINK ABOUT SPENDING THEM SOME FLOWERS,.
SURE.
Stephen: HOW LONG BEFORE YOU ARE SENDING MEN UP OR WOMEN.
YEAH, SO WE-- WE HOPE TO BE SENDING PEOPLE UP IN ABOUT 2 TO 3 YEARS WITH DRAGON VERSION 2, THE SPACECRAFT IS ABLE TO LAND PROPULSIVELY AND WITH PRECISION.
Stephen: LIKE THAT THING JUST DID.
YEAH, SIMILAR TO THAT ALTHOUGH IT HAS 8 SIDE MOUNTED THRUSTERS AND USES DIFFERENTIAL THROTTLING FOR CONTROL INSTEAD OF THE MAIN ENGINE.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: CAN YOU HANG ON A SECOND? I WANT TO TALK MORE HERE FOR A SECOND. WE HAVE TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE FROM ELON MUSK. STICK AROUND.
