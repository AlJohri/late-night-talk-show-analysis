[EAGLE CAW]
Stephen: TONIGHT, A  SURPRISING CANDIDATE FOR  CONGRESS. IS IT YOU? IF YOU'RE NOT SURE, YOU PROBABLY  SHOULDN'T RUN. [LAUGHTER] THEN, SHOULD AMERICA GET RID OF  THE PENNY? OR SHOULD THEY LEAVE THEM IN  AMERICA'S COUCH CUSHIONS. [LAUGHTER] AND MY GUEST LAWRENCE WRIGHT HAS  WRITTEN A NEW BOOK ON  SCIENTOLOGY. AFTER THE INTERVIEW, DON'T  FORGET TO TAKE OUR FREE STRESS  TEST. [LAUGHTER] HOME DEPOT IS GOING TO HIRE  80,000 NEW WORKERS FOR THE  SPRING. YOU KNOW WHERE THEY CAN FIND  SOME CHEAP LABOR? IN THEIR PARKING LOT. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING]  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN!"] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO THE BROADCAST,  EVERYBODY. SIT DOWN HEROS. IN HERE, OUT THERE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS, YOU KNOW I'M NOT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M NOT  GOING TO FIGHT YOUR PRAISE OF  ME. YOU'RE RIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, I DON'T GENERALLY LIKE TO  REPORT ON NEWS FROM CANADA. MOSTLY BECAUSE THE HEADLINES ARE  ALWAYS SCREAMING: EVERYTHING  STILL OKAY. [LAUGHTER] BUT TONIGHT, I HAVE NO CHOICE  BUT TO TURN OUR ATTENTION NORTH  BECAUSE CANADA HAS DONE THE  UNTHINKABLE.
IN CANADA, THEY'RE DUMPING  THE PENNY.
IT IS THE END OF THE PENNY.
THE ROYAL CANADIAN MINT  OFFICIALLY ENDING ITS  DISTRIBUTION OF THE PENNY.
CANADA IS DROPPING ITS PENNY  TODAY.
Stephen: CANADA DROPPED ITS  PENNY? [LAUGHTER] WITHOUT THE CANADIAN PENNY, WHAT  WILL WE AMERICANS OCCASIONALLY  GET MIXED UP WITH OUR CHANGE? [LAUGHTER] MORE OF OUR PENNIES? PROBABLY NOT. THANKS TO THIS.
SOME ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THE  U.S SHOULD DO THE SAME.
WILL THE U.S. FOLLOW SUIT?
WILL THAT MEAN THE END OF  HONEST ABE HERE IN THE U.S.?
Stephen: YES, WILL THAT BE  THE END OF THE LINCOLN PENNY. OR THE NEW DANIEL DAY LEWIS  PENNY. [LAUGHTER] SO CONVINCING. [ LAUGHTER ] THANKFULLY, SOME BRAVE PATRIOTS  ARE RESISTING THIS PENNY PINCH. A GROUP CALLED AMERICANS FOR  COMMON CENTS, WHICH IS A  DELIGHTFUL PLAY ON WORDS BECAUSE THE PENNY IS SO COMMON. [LAUGHTER] I GET IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AMERICANS FOR COMMON CENTS IS A  LOBBY GROUP THAT "AIMS TO INFORM  AND EDUCATE POLICYMAKERS, CONSUMERS, AND THE MEDIA ABOUT  THE PENNY'S ECONOMIC, CULTURAL,  AND HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE." THAT'S RIGHT, HISTORICAL  SIGNIFICANCE. FOR INSTANCE: DID YOU KNOW,  HISTORIANS TELL US THERE WAS A  TIME WHEN PENNIES WERE USEFUL. [LAUGHTER] AND AMERICANS FOR COMMON SENSE  BACKS EVERYTHING UP WITH SCIENCE  EVIDENCE, LIKE A RECENT POLL WHICH SHOWED THAT "ALMOST  TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICANS STILL  FEEL THE PENNY SHOULD BE RETAINED."  AND YOU CAN TRUST THAT POLL,  BECAUSE IT WAS CONDUCTED BY  LEADING OPINION RESEARCHERS  COINSTAR. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ] COINSTAR, CLEARLY IMPARTIAL. THEY DON'T CARE IF THE  GOVERNMENT GOT RID OF ALL  CHANGE. THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF METAL  DISKS FOR THEM TO COUNT. WHO DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW HOW  MANY WASHERS YOU HAVE IN YOUR  POCKET? [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, CYNICS SAY AMERICANS  FOR COMMON CENTS CAN'T BE  TRUSTED JUST BECAUSE "THEY ARE RUN BY THE MAIN LOBBYIST  REPRESENTING THE ZINC INDUSTRY,  WHICH SUPPLIES MOST OF THE METAL USED IN PENNIES." [LAUGHTER] TURNS OUT PENNIES ARE MOSTLY  ZINC. THAT'S WHY WHENEVER I FEEL A  COLD COMING ON, I SHOVE A COUPLE  UP MY NOSE. [LAUGHTER] HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU. LET ME JUST GET A PENNY OVER  HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT A GUMBALL. [LAUGHTER] I GOTTA SAY I GOT A LITTLE  PANICKY THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] KIDS, DON'T TRY THAT ANYWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ] BESIDES, WHAT KIND OF WORLD  WOULD THIS BE WITHOUT THE NOBLE  PENNY? WHAT WOULD WE LEAVE IN THE  TAKE-A-PENNY LEAVE-A-PENNY TRAY? [LAUGHTER] AND WITHOUT PENNIES, WILL I HAVE  TO OFFER A NICKEL FOR YOUR  THOUGHTS? [LAUGHTER] THAT'S A 500% RAISE FOR THE SAME  AMOUNT OF THINKING! [LAUGHTER] WHAT WILL WE DROP OFF THE EMPIRE  STATE BUILDING TO KILL TOURISTS? [LAUGHTER] SO STAND BY THE NOBLE PENNY-- A  SYMBOL OF FREEDOM, HOPE AND  SOMETHING YOU FIND WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR STOVE. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THAT'S MY TWO CENTS. ONLY POSSIBLE, THANKS TO THE  PENNY! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, AS YOU KNOW I'M A PROUD  SON OF SOUTH CAROLINA. WE'VE GOT THE BEST PEACHES, THE  BEST SHRIMP, AND THE MOST  GENEROUS AVERAGE HUMIDITY IN  AMERICA. [LAUGHTER] 86%! GOING OUTSIDE IN THE SUMMERTIME  IS LIKE WALKING THROUGH A  REFRESHING CHOWDER. AND MY LOVE FOR THE PALMETTO  STATE IS WHY I WAS A NATURAL  CHOICE TO FILL JIM DeMINT'S SENATE SEAT WHEN HE STEPPED DOWN  IN DECEMBER. SADLY, GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY  APPOINTED REPRESENTATIVE TIM  SCOTT WHO WAS THE CONGRESSMAN FROM MY HOMETOWN OF CHARLESTON,  LEAVING THAT CONGRESSIONAL SEAT  OPEN. GOD ONLY KNOWS WHO THEY'RE GOING  TO FIND TO FILL IT.
AND ELIZABETH COLBERT-BUSCH  IS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN SOUTH  CAROLINA. SHE IS NOT RELATED TO GEORGE W. BUSH, BUT SHE IS RELATED TO  STEPHEN COLBERT. THAT'S HIS SISTER.
Stephen: HOLY COW! MY SISTER'S RUNNING FOR  CONGRESS! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "COLBERT"] YOU  BETTER BE CHEERING FOR ME! [LAUGHTER] NOW, LULU --  LULU IS WHAT WE IN THE FAMILY  CALLED HER GROWING UP. I CAN STILL CALL HER THAT  BECAUSE SHE STILL CALLS ME BY MY  CHILDHOOD NICKNAME: STEPHEN  COLBERT. [LAUGHTER] NOW RIGHT AWAY, I WANT TO DISPEL  ONE OF THE VICIOUS MEDIA RUMOURS  THAT IS SWIRLING OUT THERE.
COLBERT-BUSCH IS STEPHEN  COLBERT'S SISTER.
SHE MIGHT BE GETTING A LITTLE  FREE TV TIME.
Stephen: WRONG! NO FREE AIR TIME, LULU. AS A BROADCAST JOURNALIST, I AM  OBLIGATED TO MAINTAIN PURE  OBJECTIVITY. IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT ELIZABETH  COLBERT BUSCH IS INTELLIGENT,  HARD WORKING, COMPASSIONATE, AND DEDICATED TO THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH  CAROLINA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WILL NOT BE MENTIONING ANY OF  THAT ON MY SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] BESIDES, I'M NOT SURE I CAN  SUPPORT HER BECAUSE SHE IS  RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT. A: I TAKE THAT AS A PERSONAL  AFFRONT. AND TWO, THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT  CHOICES ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. NO LESS THAN 16 CANDIDATES HAVE  FILED IN THE GOP PRIMARY. I MEAN REPUBLICANS ARE OVER THIS  ELECTION LIKE WHITE ON  REPUBLICANS. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE ARE SOME BIG NAMES ON THE  GOP TICKET. I'M TALKING RIC "THE STICK"  BRYANT, THE ELECTRIFYING KEITH  "BLAND"FORD, LARRY "BOOM BOOM" GROOMS, ELIZABETH "KILLING THEM  SOFTLY" MOFFLY, AND CHIP "THIS  IS MY ACTUAL NAME" LIMEHOUSE. [LAUGHTER] BUT AT THIS POINT, I'M LEANING  TOWARD ACTUAL CANDIDATE AND  FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL MARK SANFORD. [LAUGHTER] SEE, I'M A FAMILY VALUES  CONSERVATIVE AND MARK, HE JUST  SEEMS SO STEADY. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, QUICK ADVICE FOR ANY OF YOU  REPUBLICANS WHO MIGHT END UP IN  A DEBATE WITH MY SISTER. THIS IS HOW I USED TO WIN A LOT  OF ARGUMENTS WITH HER AS A KID. RIGHT AFTER SHE MAKES A GOOD  POINT, REPEAT IT BACK TO HER IN  A DUMB VOICE. [SPEAK IN DUMB VOICE] "OOO, SOCIAL SECURITY IS A  PUBLIC TRUST TO THOSE WHO PAID  INTO IT FOR THEIR ENTIRE WORKING LIVES."  "STOP COPYING ME! I'M TELLING MOM!" [LAUGHTER] TRUST ME, IT WORKS. THEN AGAIN SHE'S TOUGH. SHE COULD WIN. AND IF YOU DO, LULU, I HOPE  YOU'LL SIT DOWN WITH ME FOR A  BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO  DEFEND SOME SHOCKING REVELATIONS  FROM YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL DIARY. OH MY GOD! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
