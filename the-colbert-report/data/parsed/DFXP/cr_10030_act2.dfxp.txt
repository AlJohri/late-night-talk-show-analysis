[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, YOU KNOW I LIKE TO STAY ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF TECHNOLOGY, EVERY TIME THEY ANNOUNCE A NEW TECH DEVICE I AM THE FIRST ONE TO RECEIVE A ALERT ON MY BEEPER. THAT IS TELLING ME RIGHT NOW TO CHECK THE OLD FAX MACHINE.
WHAT'S THAT?  I GET 1,000 FREE AOL MINUTES?  I CAN FINALLY FINISH DOWN LOWING THAT PICTURE OF TERI HATCHER!  FORCE.
FOLKS, THAT IS WHY I WAS SO EXCITED TO LEARN ABOUT AN AMAZING NEW PRODUCT FROM DOUBLE ROBOTICS.
WHEN YOU NEED TO BE IN THE OFFICE BUT CAN'T BE THERE, HOW ABOUT HAVING A ROBOT STAND IN YOUR PLACE?  THAT'S THE IDEA WITH DOUBLE, DOUBLE IS THE IPAD CAMERA AS YOUR REMOTE EYE, DOUBLE IS WHAT BUSINESSES WHO WANT TO HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE OFFICE.
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT HERE!
THAT'S RIGHT. A MOBILE ROBOT THAT GIVES TELECOMMUTERS A LIFE LIKE PRESENCE AT THE OFFICE, AS LONG AS THAT OFFICE DOES NOT INCLUDE STAIRS.
NOW, SURE, BEFORE THE DOUBLE CAME ALONG YOU COULD SKYPE WITH YOUR COWORKERS, BUT THAT ROBS YOU OF THE MOST FUN PART OF THE WORKDAY THE VALUABLE TIME YOU SPEND WALKING FROM ROOM TO ROOM.
EVEN OFFICE AFFAIRS ARE EASIER WITH A DOUBLE, NOW YOU CAN STAY AT HOME WHILE STILL GETTING IT ON WITH YOUR ASSISTANT VANESSA IN THE BROOM CLOSET OR SKYPING JANET FROM ACCOUNTS AND MAKING A THREE-WAY. BUT DON'T FORGET TO USE SURGE PROTECTION. THE ONLY PROBLEM I SEE -- YES, PEOPLE LOVE JANICE. PEOPLE LOVE JANET. THE ONLY PROBLEM I SEE WITH THE DOUBLE IS THAT THAT IF EVERYBODY STARTS TELECOMMUTING TO THE OFFICE THERE WILL BE NO ONE LEFT TO PICK UP ALL THE OVERTURNED ROBOTS. IF YOU'RE AS COMMITTED TO PRODUCTIVITY AS I AM, YOU'LL BRING THE DOUBLE WITH YOU TO WORK, FIRST OF ALL YOU CAN USE THE CAR POOL LANE, AND BEST OF ALL THE DOUBLE SAVES MONEY BY ELIMINATING EXPENSIVE STAFF LIKE BY UNPAID   INTERN, JAY THE INTERN, SPEAKING OF WHICH I CAN GO FOR A NICE WARM CUP OF COFFEE. JAY, GET ON OUT HERE. COME ON, JAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ].  YES, STEPHEN?
DON'T TALK TO ME, JAY. TALK TO ME. HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: JAY, COME ON, TALK TO ME. THERE YOU GO. STOP. THERE. STOP THERE. THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. THERE WE ARE. JAY, I HAVE SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU.
YES?
Stephen: TALK TO THE STICK!
OKAY.
Stephen: YOU'RE FIRED.
BUT WHO WILL BRING YOU YOUR COFFEE?
Stephen: GIVE IT TO THE STICK!  THANK YOU. NOW, ADIOS, YOU PARASITE, COME ON, GET OUT OF HERE.
OKAY. NOW THAT THAT UGLY BUSINESS IS OVER, TIME TO ENJOY MY PIPING HOT CUP OF JOE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO THIS THING. HERE WE GO. YEP. THERE WE GO. DOWN AND IN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: JAY!  JAY?  WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. JAY, ARE YOU THERE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
