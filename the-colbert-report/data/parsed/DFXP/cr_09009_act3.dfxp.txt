WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW  BOOK ON AMERICA'S ATOMIC  ARSENAL IN THE 1950s. SO IT WAS A SIMPLER TIME. BEN WE COULD BLOW UP ITS  WORLD ONLY NINE TIMES. PLEASE WELCOME EVAN THOMAS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY, SIR, THANK YOU FOR  COMING ON HERE. YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK. IT'S CALLED IKE BLUFF  PRESIDENT EISENHOWER'S  SECRET BATTLE TO SAVE THE  WORLD. NOW I GOT A BEEF WITH IKE  THAT I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD. BECAUSE I LIKE IKE, YOU LIKE  IKE, EVERYBODY LIKES IKE. TURNS OUT IKE WAS A HUGE  APPROXIMATES USSY. (LAUGHTER)
NO, HE WASN'T.
Stephen: HE WAS. HE WAS. HE WAS AFRAID OF GOING  TOE-TO-TOE WITH THE  RUSSSKIES IN NUCLEAR  ANNIHILATION.
HE WAS NOT, HE WAS BRAVE,  HE WAS A BRAVE SOLDIER. BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT  WARS. HE WANTED TO BLUFF THE  RUSSIANS. 1950s. COMMUNISM WAS ON THE MARCH  AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT  A NUCLEAR WAR. HE DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT ANY  KIND OF WAR BUT HE BLUFFED  WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
Stephen: HE WAS THE ALLY. HE KNEW THAT WE WON WORLD  WAR II WITH NUCLEAR BOMBS,  DID THAT ESCAPE HIS  ATTENTION.
HE DIDN'T WANT IT TO DO  HIROSHIMA OR NAGASAKI AT  HOME OR IN RUSSIA. HE SAW WHAT NUCLEAR BOMB KOS  DO AND DIDN'T WANT TO USE  THEM.
Stephen: BUT YOU SAY HE  WAS UNWILLING TO DO FIRST  STRIKE.
WELL, HE DIDN'T-- YES, HE  DIDN'T WANT TO GO FIRST. HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. HE ACTUALLY, INTERESTINGLY,  HE THOUGHT ABOUT GOING FIRST  AND TRYING TO KNOCK OUT THE  SOVIET DOWNBEFORE THEY COULD KNOCK US OUT. HE THOUGHT WE HAD RAY MORAL  DUTY TO AT LEAST CONSIDER  THAT BUT THOUGHT ABOUT IT  AND THOUGHT IMMORAL, BAD, WRONG, SO THEY DIDN'T DO IT  BUT THEY DID THINK ABOUT IT.
OKAY, BUT WHY IS THE  GENERAL, WAS HE SO HESITANT  TO USE MASSIVE MILITARY  SUPPORT.
BECAUSE HE USED IT HE HAD  SEENS IT, HE HAD SEEN THE  EFFECTS OF IT HE FLEW AFTER  WORLD WAR II HE FLEW IN A SMALL PLANE FROM BERLIN TO  MOSKOW AND OVER THE ROOFS,  THE GERMAN ARMY AND RUSSIAN  ARMEE, AND HE DIDN'T SEE A SINGLE BUILDING LEFT  STANDING. HE KNEW WHAT WAR COULD DO. HE KNEW HOW HORRIBLE IT WAS  BECAUSE HE HAD RUN A WAR. SOW WANTED TO AVOID WAR.
IS THIS WHY WE SHOULDN'T  ELECT GENERALS ANY MORE?
WELL, WE-- .
Stephen: GUYS LIKE ROM  KNOW AND GEORGE W. BUSH  WITHOUT DIDN'T ACTUALLY  SERVE IN I WAR, YOU KNOW, STILL HAVE THE BALLS TO SEND  OTHER PEOPLE TO GO IN TO  FIGHT. SOMETIMES THE POST DANGEROUS  GUYS.
ARE THE ONES WHO HAVEN'T  BEEN TO WA, THEY CALL THEM  CHICKEN HAWKS.
Stephen: PROUD ONE RIGHT  HERE.
UNFORTUNATELY, I AM DEAF  THIS ONE YEAR BUT OR I WOULD  HAVE SERVED IN MANY, MANY  WARS.
MILITARY GUYS WHO HAVE  SEEN WAR SOMETIMES KNOW  ENOUGH TO TRY TO STAY OUT OF  IT.
Stephen: OKAY. BUT YOU SAY THAT HE WAS A  POKER PLAYER.
HE WAS.
Stephen: WHAT HAND WAS  IKE HOLDING?
BECAUSE IF IT'S A BLUFF  THAT MEANS HE DIDN'T  ACTUALLY HAVE THE CARDS. WHAT HAND DOW SAY PARKER DID  NOT HAVE?
AMERICA WAS NOT ACTUALLY  GOING TO USE THESE WEAPONS. HE WANTED TO MAKE THE  RUSSIANS THINK MAN, WE'RE  GOING TO NUKE YOU BUT HE  WASN'T GOING DO IT SSES BUT DIDN'T RUSSIA IMMEDIATELY  KNOW THAT WE WEREN'T WHEN HE  DIDN'T HELP OUT THE  HUNGARIANS AND THE SOVIETS SENDING THOSE TANKS TO CRUSH  THOSE --
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH NOT  TO GO INTO HUNGARY BECAUSE  IT MIGHT HAVE PRO-- PROVOKED  A WORLD WAR. WE COULDN'T HAVE SAVED  HUNGARY.
Stephen: SOMETIMES YOU  HAVE TO NUKE A VILLAGE TO  SAVE IT.
EISENHOWER WAS SMART  ENOUGH TO STAY OUT OF WARS  HE COULDN'T WIN. AND THAT WAS A WAR WE  COULDN'T WIN.
Stephen: I GOT ANOTHER  BEEF WITH IKE HERE. THIS IS A LONG-STANDING BEEF  BUT I HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR  IT BEFORE UNTIL I ALMOST  READ YOUR BOOK. IKE WARNED US ABOUT THE  MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. WHAT DE MEAN BY THAT?
HE MEANS THE MILITARY  SOMETIMES EXAGGERATES  THREATS, BECAUSE THEY WANT  MORE MONEY TO BUILD MORE  WEAPONS. AND SO MILITARY CONTRACTS  DOESN'T GET MORE MONEY. IKE WAS A SOLDIER, HE HAD  BEEN AT THE PENTAGON. HE USED TO TALK ABOUT THOSE  BOYS DOWN AT THE PENTAGON. HE KNEW THAT THEY  SOMETIMES-- HE WANTED TO  DIAL THAT BACK AND HE WAS  WORRIED THAT CIVILIAN  POLITICIAN WAS DIDN'T KNOW BETTER WOULD GET SUCKED IN  BY THE MILITARY.
Stephen: HE SAID THAT AS  HE WAS GOING OUT THE DOOR,  RIGHT.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY DIDN'T HE  SAY IT WHILE HE WAS  PRESIDENT AND COULD DO  SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
DE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
Stephen: WHAT DID HE DO.
MILITARY SPENDING UNDER  IKE WENT DOWN, NOT UP. EVEN THOUGH-- .
Stephen: REALLY?
HE KUPT INTO HIS OWN  SERVICE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T  WANT TO USE THEM. HE CUT INTO THEM. HE BUILT UP NUCLEAR BOMBERS  AND MISSILES BECAUSE HE HAD  TO, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE  RUSH ARNES WERE DOING BUT HE SPENT LESS ON HIS OWN  SERVICE. HE WAS BRAVE IN DOING THAT  HIS OWN ARMY WAS MAD AT HIM.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU  THINK IKE WOULD DO ABOUT  SOME OF THE PRESENT MILITARY  CONUNDRUMS WE'RE FACING. IF HE DIDN'T GO INTO HUNGARY  WOULD HE GO INTO SYRIA?
NO. HE WAS AN ALL OR NOTHING  GUY. HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN SMALL  WARS. HE THOUGHT SMALL WARS-- .
Stephen: NOT FEEDING  WEAPONS TO ANYBODY.
HE WOULD HAVE DONE COVERT  STUFF.
Stephen: HE PUT THE SHAW  OF IRAN IN.
HE LIKED THE CIA A LITTLE  TOO MUCH. HE-- .
Stephen: HE HAD A  BRO-MANCE WITH THE CIA.
HE WAS A ROMANTIC GUY BUT  NOT WITH THE CIA.
Stephen: HE WAS SAID TO  BE A ROMANTIC GUY. (LAUGHTER)
SO HE WOULDN'T SEND-- HE  WOULDN'T SEND WEAPONS OR  GROUND TROOPS INTO SYRIA?
NO.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT  KEEPING IRAN FROM GETTING  THE BOMB?
WELL, THAT'S A HARD ONE. AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT HE  WOULD DO. HE WOULD REALLY NOT, NOT  WANT IRAN TO GET THE BOMB. I THINK HE WOULD DO  EVERYTHING THROUGH COVERT  ACTION THAT HE POSSIBLY COME  HE WOULD UNLEASH THE CIA BUT HE WOULD NOT, HE WOULDN'T  WANT THEM TO GET THE BOMB.
Stephen: NOW IKE WAS A  MODERATE REPUBLICAN.
HE WAS.
Stephen: FOR OUR YOUNGER  AUDIENCE, WHAT ARE THOSE? IS.
YES, TOO BAD IT IS ALMOST  EXTINCT. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IS THERE ANY  SORT OF CAPTIVE BREEDING  PROGRAM OR ANYTHING LIKE  THAT? YOU LOOK AT ONE, THEY ARE  BEAUTIFUL PLUMBAGE.
THEY WERE GREAT TO HAVE  AROUND. BECAUSE THEY WOULD ACTUALLY  COMPROMISE, THEY WOULD GET  STUFF DONE.
Stephen: THEY WOULD DO  THINGS, BUT THEY BELIEVED IN  BIG GOVERNMENT LIKE IKE  BUILT THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM, SIR.
HE DID.
Stephen: A TRUE  REPUBLICAN WOULD HAVE LET  INDIVIDUAL CORPORATIONS PAVE  THEIR OWN STREETS AND DECIDE WHICH SIDE TO DRIVE ON.
A TRUE STUPID REPUBLICAN  BUT THE SMART REPUBLICAN  LIKE IKE WOULD UNDERSTAND  YOU HAVE TO HAVE  INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME  GOVERNMENT. IKE DID NOT DISMANTLE THE  NEW DEAL. A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WANTED  TO JUST GET RID OF THE NEW  DEAL, THEY WERE DONE WITH  THAT. IKE PRESERVED THAT AND HE  KNEW TO DO LONG-TERM THINGS. LIKE BUILD HIGHWAYS THAT WE  NEED BECAUSE HE KNEW THE  ECONOMY NEEDED IT. EVEN THOUGH HE WAS NOT A FAN  OF BIG GOVERNMENT. IN FACT HE WAS A BALANCED  BUDGET GUY. HE CONTROLLED GOVERNMENT  SPENDING. I WISH WE HAD MORE GUYS  TODAY LIKE IKE WHO DID THAT. BUT HE DID. HE WAS A BALANCED BUDGET  GUY.
Stephen: WHICH OF THE TWO  CANDIDATES ARE MORE LIKE HIM,  ROMNEY OR OBAMA?
FLEERT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THANK  YOU SO MUCH. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: EVAN THOMAS, THE  BOOK IS IKE'S BLUFF. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
