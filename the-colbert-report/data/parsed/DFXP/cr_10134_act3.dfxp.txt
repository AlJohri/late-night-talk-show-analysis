WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. I AM HERE WITH SPACE X AND TESLA MOTORS FOUNDER ELON MUSK. THE TWO OF US ARE TALKING AS I SAID I'VE GOT A TESLA AND I LOVE THE CAR. AND IT'S MILES-- IT'S THE BEST DAMN GOLF CART I'VE EVER DRIVEN. IT REALLY, THE ACCELERATION IS INCREDIBLE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE. THEY WON'T LET ME TAKE IT ON THE LINKS AT MY CLUB BUT OTHER THAN THAT, YOU RECENTLY MADE ALL THE PATENTS FOR TESLA AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY. SAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO PROSECUTE PEOPLE IF THEY USE OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGY OF TESLA. WHY ARE YOU GIVING AWAY THE STORE LIKE THAT. WHY ARE YOU BEING THE EDWARD SNOWDEN OF YOU
RIGHT. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE RIGHT ANALOGY, BUT IF WE ARE ALL ON A SHIP TOGETHER AND WE-- AND THERE'S SOME HOLES IN THE SHIP AND WE ARE BAILING WATER OUT, AND WE HAVE A GREAT DESIGN FOR A BUCKET, THEN YOU KNOW, EVEN IF WE ARE BAILING OUT WAY BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE, WE SHOULD PROBABLY STILL SHARE THE BUCKET DESIGN. BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GOING TO SINK. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LAST QUESTION, YOU'RE A FUTURE MAN, WHERE IS MY JET PACK.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN-- ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK ON YOUTUBE THERE IS A LOT OF INTERESTING VIDEO.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT A CAT IN THE JET PACK, I WANT TO GET IN THE JET PACK
Stephen: HAVE YOU WORKED ON A JET PACK OF YOUR OWN.
I HAVEN'T, NO. NO, I-- I'M NOT SURE ABOUT JET PACKS. THERE IS SOME FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS THAT MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE A JET PACK IT WOULD BE VERY NOISY.
Stephen: IT'S HARD TO LAND  A ROCKET ON ITS TAIL TOO.
TRUE.
Stephen: EYES ON THE PRIZE.
BUT YOU KNOW, SOMETHING I THINK WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE IS IF THAT AIRCRAFT SHOULD HAVE VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING.
Stephen: LIKE A HARRIER.
KIND OF LIKE A HARRIER BUT IT'S BETTER TO MOVE WITH THE FAN THEN IT IS TO DUCT THE AIR.
Stephen: RIGHT NOW THE HARRIER DOES IT WITH DUCTS? AND DUCT TAPE, ONE IMAGINES.
I THINK THE HARRIER IS A GREAT PLANE BUT I THINK THERE IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING, ELECTRIC SUPERSONIC JET.
Stephen: ELECTRIC JET.
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT SHOOTS SPARKS OUT THE BACK. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW DO YOU HAVE AN ELECTRIC JET.
YOU USE AN ELECTRIC MOTOR TO DRIVE A FAN.
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY.
YEAH.
IT'S-- ACTUALLY JET AIRCRAFT ARE MOSTLY SOUND DRIVEN-- TRADITIONAL JET AIRCRAFT LIKE WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING CALLED A JET ENGINE LIKE ON A TRIPLE 7, IT'S GOT THAT HUGE-- IT LOOKS HUGE, AND THAT IS BECAUSE MOST OF THE PROPULSION IS REALLY COMING FROM THE FAN. SO-- .
Stephen: SO YOU NEED A BIG FAN.
YEAH. IT'S REALLY-- .
Stephen: REALLY IT'S A PROP PLANE THAT THEY DRESSED UP TO LOOK LIKE A JET.
KIND OF THAT, YEAH.
Stephen: I HAVE BEEN LIED TO.
WELL, THERE'S SOME VALUE TO HAVING DUCTS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MORE EFFICIENT TO HAVE AN OPEN FAN IF YOU JUST CARE ABOUT EFFICIENCY PER MILE BUT YOU CAN GO FASTER IF YOU HAVE A DUCT SITUATION.
Stephen: WHAT IS NEXT, WHAT IS THE NEXT THING, WHAT ARE GOING TO BLOW MY MIND WITH?
WELL-- WHAT DO YOU WISH THERE WAS? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I WISH THERE WEREN'T ANY CABLES. I WISH THAT COMPUTERS DIDN'T HAVE TO BE TYPED INTO. I THINK THE MOUSE ON THE KEYBOARD IS TERRIBLE. IT'S A TERRIBLE INTERFACE, THAT I SHOULD HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MACHINE AND I WOULD HAVE A DISCUSSION OF MY NEEDS AND IT WOULD DO IT.
RIGHTS.
Stephen: AND I ALSO THINK THAT CABLES ON ANYTHING IS TERRIBLE. NOT COMMUNICATION, BUT CHARGING CABLES AS WELL.
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT I WOULD JUST WALK INTO MY HOUSE AND THINGS WAS CHARGE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: OR I WOULD HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE TO A CHARGING SYSTEM AND THAT ANYWHERE I WENT IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE WOULD BE A CHARGE THAT WOULD FOLLOW ME AROUND.
RIGHT, RIGHT. OKAY. OKAY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WILL YOU GET BACK TO ME.
NO, WE'LL DO IT.
Stephen: THANK YOU, ELON MUSK, SPACEX, TESLA MOTORS AND WIRELESS CHARGING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
