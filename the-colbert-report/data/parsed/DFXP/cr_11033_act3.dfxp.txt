(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PRESIDENT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA! MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IT'S VERY EXCITING. YOU AND I DON'T ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE ON THINGS --
I'M GLAD ABOUT THAT, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: YOU'RE GLAD WE DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE? YES, I WOULD BE WORRIED IF I SAW EYE TO EYE WITH YOU.
Stephen: I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK IN YOUR EYES BUT I'M ONLY ABOUT 5'10 AND A HALF. IT'S EXCITING TO SAY THE WORDS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DO YOU STILL GET EXCITED OR HAVE YOU EVER BEEN EXCITED WHEN  YOU HEAR THE WORDS PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA?
NO.
Stephen: DO YOU LIKE THE JOB?
I LOVE THE JOB. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE, BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN IT, YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF TITLES, YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU DELIVER FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND ALSO WHEN I GO HOME, MICHELLE, MALIA, SASHA GIVE ME A HARD TIME AND THERE ARE NO TRUMPETS AND THEY TEASE ME MERCILESSLY FOR MY BIG EARS OR MY STODGY SUITS --
Stephen: DO YOU DO NORMAL THINGS LIKE LEAVE YOUR SOCKS ON THE FLOOR AND STUFF LIKE THAT?
I DO.
Stephen: HOW DOES THAT GO OVER?
NOT WELL. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU HAVE THE NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES, RIGHT?
YES, I DO.
Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TO ASK FOR THEM.
GOOD.
Stephen: CAN YOU TELL ME IF THERE'S A 5 IN THERE? (LAUGHTER)
NO.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. SPEAKING OF TRUSTING PEOPLE WITH EXTRAORDINARY POWER... (LAUGHTER) I WANT TO GO BACK ONE SECOND TO 2008. PART OF YOUR CAMPAIGN WAS BELIEVING THAT THE PRESIDENT AT THE TIME HAD INVESTED THE EXECUTIVE WITH TOO MUCH POWER. THEN YOU BECAME PRESIDENT, AND YOU SEEMED TO HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF POWER.
RIGHT.
Stephen: DOES THAT HAPPEN TO EVERY PRESIDENT, WHERE YOU GET INTO THE OFFICE AND YOU THINK, YOU KNOW WHAT? I MIGHT BE THE ONLY ONE I TRUST WITH THIS MUCH POWER, SO I'LL HOLD ON TO IT? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU'RE ASKING A SENSIBLE QUESTION. (LAUGHTER) WHAT IS TRUE -- (LAUGHTER) -- THE STRUCTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS CHECKS AND BALANCES, AND EVERY PRESIDENT, EVEN IF ON THE OUTSIDE THEY WERE COMPLAINING, THERE'S ALWAYS THE TEMPTATION TO WANT TO GO AHEAD AND GET STUFF DONE AND DEMOCRACY IS MESSY AND COMPLICATED. SO THE TENDENCY IS TO SAY, WELL, LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET THIS DONE, JUST BECAUSE THINGS ARE SO BOTTLED UP, ESPECIALLY AT A MOMENT WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF GRIDLOCK. WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNCIL WHICH WEIGHS IN ON WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT DO IS FIERCELY INDEPENDENT. THEY MAKE DECISIONS. WE WORK WELL WITHIN THE LINES OF THAT. BUT MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO GET A WHOLE LOT MORE DONE THROUGH CONGRESS, WHICH IS WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION, WHAT I SAID TO THEM IS, IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH HOW WE'RE APPROACHING THIS EXECUTIVE ACTION, THERE IS AN EASY SOLUTION, PASS A BILL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IF YOU PASS A BILL, THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THINGS DONE. YOU KNOW, TOO OFTEN WHAT WE HAVE IS A CONGRESS THAT IS STUCK, AND THEN THE EXECUTIVE AND/OR THE COURTS END UP FILLING THE GAPS. AND I THINK THAT THE MORE WE CAN GET CONGRESS TO ACTUALLY WORK THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO, THE LESS THESE PROBLEMS COME UP.
Stephen: LAST QUESTION, SIR.
YES, GO AHEAD.
Stephen: BARACK OBAMA, GREAT PRESIDENT, OR THE GREATEST PRESIDENT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'LL LEAVE THAT ONE ALONE, STEPHEN!
Stephen: PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, WHAT AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BARACK OBAMA, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, SIR.
