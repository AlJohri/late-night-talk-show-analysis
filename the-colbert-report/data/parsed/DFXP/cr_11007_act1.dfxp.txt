TONIGHT, A SURPRISE MOVE BY THE SUPREME COURT, YOU'LL  NEVER GUESS WHAT CLARENCE THOMAS DIDN'T SAY THIS TIME. PLUS THE LATEST IN THE WAR AGAINST ISIS. THEN TO CHEER YOU UP, THE LATEST ON EBOLA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND MY GUEST IS COMEDY LEGEND CAROL BURNETT WHO IS NOW STARRING ON BROADWAY. OOOH! I BET SHE MAKES A GREAT MUFASA. THE NEIMAN MARCUS CATALOG IS SELLING A CUSTOM PERFUME FOR $475,000. IT'S THE PERFECT GIFT FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SMELL LIKE AN IDIOT. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT."     CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY     COMEDY CENTRAL ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
STEPHEN: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE REPORT. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, NATION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, FOLKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I NEED-- I NEED-- I NEED THE STRENGTH YOU GIVE ME, BECAUSE, FOLKS, THIS IS A DARK DAY. A DARK, DAY, DAY FOR CULTURAL CONSERVATIVES LIKE MYSELF. THAT DAY-- HUMP DAY. BECAUSE GOD DECREED IN THE BIBLE HUMP DAY IS BETWEEN ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN. NOW IT'S ANYTHING GOES. ON MONDAY THE SUPREME COURT REFUSED TO HEAR FIVE GAY MARRIAGE CASES AND AS A RESULT, MORE THAN HALF OF ALL AMERICANS NOW LIVE IN A STATE WHERE GAY MARRIAGE IS LEGAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WELL, I SAY, I SAY, BRAVO. IS NOW AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE NETWORK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND WHILE OUR NATION IS GOING TO HELL IN A HANDBASKET, THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IS GOING SOMEPLACE EVEN WORSE-- CALIFORNIA.
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER WILL VISIT CALIFORNIA THIS WEEK TO RAISE MONEY FOR AN OPENLY GAY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.
SPEAKER BOEHNER IS TRYING TO BROADEN THE TENT.
HERE YOU HAVE THE TOP-RANKED REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE, THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, WHO SAYS, "I'M GOING TO GO OUT THERE FOR A GAY REPUBLICAN. THIS IS WHAT OUR PARTY STANDS FOR." I THINK THAT ACTUALLY IS A POWERFUL MESSAGE.
STEPHEN: THAT POWERFUL MESSAGE, PLEASE FORGET ALL OF OUR PREVIOUS MESSAGES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, FOLKS, THAT IS WRONG. THAT IS JUST WRONG! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I AM STUNNED. I CAN'T BE ALONE WITH THIS FEELING. I AM ABSOLUTE STUNNED THAT JOHN BOEHNER IS RAISING MONEY FOR A HOMOSEXUAL CANDIDATE AND CONFESSED GAY PERSON, CARL DEMAIO. BECAUSE, FOLKS, THIS IS JUST A SLIPPERY FOLKS. TODAY BOEHNER IS FUND-RAISING FOR GAYS. TOMORROW HE'S DOING ROBOCALLS FOR BOX TURTLES. AND JUST LAST YEAR BOEHNER SAID THIS--
I BELIEVE THAT MARRIAGE IS THE UNION OF ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN. IT'S WHAT MY CHURCH TEACHES ME, AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT POSITION WOULD EVER CHANGE.
STEPHEN: NO, NO, IT WON'T CHANGE, WON'T CHANGE AT ALL. THAT'S WHAT BEING STRAIGHT IS ALL ABOUT. YOU PICK ONE POSITION AND YOU STICK WITH IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. OKAY. FACE TO FACE, LIGHTS ON, NO EYE CONTACT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LUCKILY, FOLKS, THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL AND THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MARRIAGE HAVE STOOD UP WITH AN OPENLY ANTIGAY LETTER SAYING WE CANNOT IN GOOD CONGRESS URGE OUR MEMBERS AND FELLOW CITIZENS TO SUPPORT CANDIDATES LIKE DEMAIO. THEY WILL SECURE A PLATFORM IN THE MEDIA TO ADVANCE THEIR FLAWED IDOL AND SERVE AS TERRIBLE ROLE MODELS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WILL INEVITABLY BE ENCOURAGED TO EMULATE THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, YES, IT'S INEVITABLE. TEENAGERS DEFINITELY COPY WHATEVER CONGRESS DOES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHY-- ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW-- THAT'S WHY ALL-- THAT'S WHY THE COOL KIDS ARE ALWAYS HANGING OUT AT THE MALL REFUSING TO PASS AN AGRICULTURE BILL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND BOEHNER HERE IS BETRAYING CORE CONSERVATIVE BELIEFS FOR THE WORST POSSIBLE REASON-- IT'S WHAT THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS WANT.
REPUBLICANS ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE POLITICAL REALITY THAT THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE, ARE MOVING TOWARD GAY MARRIAGE ACCEPTANCE, EVEN SUPPORT. 61%-- THAT'S MORE THAN THREE IN FIVE-- OF REPUBLICANS AGED 18-29 FAVOR ALLOWING GAYS AND LESBIANS TO MARRY LEGALLY.
STEPHEN: REALLY! THREE IN FIVE? THAT IS SHOCKING. THAT THERE ARE STILL FIVE REPUBLICANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18 AND 29. ( LAUGHTER ) I JUST-- WHERE ARE THEY? I DON'T-- ( APPLAUSE ) I GOTTA GO TO DIFFERENT CLUBS. I FEEL LIKE  THE LAST MAN ON EARTH WHO OPPOSES MAN-MAN MARRIAGE. AND ACCORDING TO GEORGE WILL, PRETTY SOON I MIGHT BE.
QUITE LITERALLY, THE OPPOSITION TO GAY MARRIAGE IS DYING. IT'S OLD PEOPLE.
STEPHEN: I'M NOT OLD, GEORGE! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M NOT OLD! I'M JUST-- I'M JUST TIRED, OKAY. I'M JUST-- I'VE BEEN DOING THE SHOW FOR NINE YEARS, FOR PETE'S SAKE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THESE RIGHT HERE, THESE-- THESE RIGHT HERE, THESE ARE JUST-- THESE ARE JUST FIGHTING GAY MARRIAGE LINES. I'M JUST AS YOUNG AND AS NEW AS MY IDEAS. ( LAUGHTER ) BESIDE, THE SANCTITY OF TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS NOT SOME FAD, GEORGE. YOU CAN'T PRAY AWAY YOUR GAY. WELL, YOU CAN'T GAY AWAY MY PRAY. FOR CHRISTIANS LIKE ME THIS IS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE IN I DON'T LIKE GAY PEOPLE GETTING CIVIL RIGHTS. AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO FEELS THAT WAY, NATIONAL REVIEW WRITER AND SKINNY GEORGE LUCAS MATTHEW J. FRANCK, RECENTLY WRITE AGO HE WROTE THAT THE COURT'S NONDECISION IS A SLOW-MOTION DRED SCOTT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. WHICH IS EERILY SIMILAR TO MY SCIENCE FICTION SERIES "SLOW MAGAZINE DRED SCOTT IN THE  21ST CENTURY." ( APPLAUSE ) DRED SCOTT, OF COURSE, WAS THE ENSLAVED PLAINTIFF IN THE SUPREME COURT CASE THAT FOUND AFRICAN AMERICAN HAD NO RIGHTS, WHICH THE WHITE MAN WAS BOUND TO RESPECT, WHICH, COINCIDENTALLY, IS ALSO THE CITY MOTTO OF FERGUSON, MISSOURI. JUST LIKE THE DRED SCOTT DECISION, THESE GAY MARRIAGE CASES WILL INEVITABLY LEAD TO A CIVIL WAR. AND I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY TO PREDICT WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE TO REMEMBER THAT WAR IN MY NEW LANDMARK DOCUMENTARY, "THE GAY CIVIL WAR." JIMMY.   ( APPLAUSE ) JIMMY, LET'S--   ( CHEERS ) JIMMY, LET'S BREAK THEIR HEARTS. MY DEAREST SARA, INDICATIONS ARE THAT WE WILL SOON MOVE OUT AGAINST OUR VAST AND FABULOUS ENEMY. I DO BELIEVE IN OUR CAUSE. AS JEFFERSON HIMSELF SAID, "IT'S ADAM AND EVE, NOT ADAM AND STEVE. AND I LOVES ME THE BROWN SUGAR. THOUGH DEATH MAY COME, I'M WILLING TO LAY DOWN MY LIFE TO MAKE SURE LESBIANS CAN'T REGISTER AT BED, BATH,  & BEYOND." SARAH, MY LOVE FOR YOU IS DEPTHLESS. IT BINDS ME WITH MIGHTY CABLES THAT NOTHING BUT OMNIPOTENCE COULD BREAK-- OR IF TWO DUDES GET MARRIED. IN THAT CASE, I AM OUT OF HERE, BECAUSE ICK. AND YES, AND YES-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, YES, WE ANTIGAY MARRIAGE CRUSADERS MAY BE FIGHTING A LOST CAUSE BUT WE STILL HAVE OUR HONOR. AND 20 YEARS FROM NOW, WE'LL SWEAR WE FOUGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
