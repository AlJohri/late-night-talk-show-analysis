(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: COME ON! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.  IN THERE, OUT THERE, ALL OVER THE WORLD. MR AND MRS AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA THANK YOU SO MUCH, HEROES! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. FOLKS -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. WE'VE GOT HUGE NEWS TO GET TO RIGHT OFF THE BAT. NATION, I'M NO FAN OF BICYCLES. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE TAKING A SPIN CLASS JUST TO GET TO MY SPIN CLASS. (LAUGHTER) NO THANKS. PLUS THEY'RE ALWAYS CROWDING THE TINY LANE I USE WHEN THERE'S TOO MUCH TRAFFIC. (LAUGHTER) WELL, OVER THE PAST WEEKEND, BICYCLES OR "BIKES," AS THE GANGBANGERS CALL THEM, CLAIMED THEIR LATEST VICTIM.
BONO RECOVERING FROM A NASTY SPILL IN NEW YORK'S CENTRAL PARK. THE U2 FRONT MAN INJURED HIS ARM AFTER FALLING OFF HIS BICYCLE. IN FACT, HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE SURGERY.
THAT'S RIGHT. BONO BROKE HIS BONE-O. (LAUGHTER) IT'S A DANGEROUS CITY, FOLKS. THEY SAY GIULIANI CLEANED IT UP, BUT NEW YORKERS STILL LIVE WITH THE LOOMING THREAT OF THE GROUND. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED "THE MEAN STREETS." AND THIS ACCIDENT CAPS OFF A WEEK THAT WAS ALREADY NO BUENO FOR BONO.
THERE'S WORD THAT BONO FROM U2 LOST HIS LUGGAGE.
HIS PRIVATE LEARJET SOMEHOW LOSING THE REAR CARGO DOOR 8,000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, LUGGAGE FLYING OUT.
INVESTIGATORS SAY THE DOOR AND SEVERAL PIECES OF LUGGAGE LANDED SOMEWHERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF GERMANY'S CAPITAL.
THAT'S RIGHT. BONO'S BAGS FELL OUT OF HIS PRIVATE PLANE. AND AFTER THREE DAYS OF INTENSE SEARCHING, BONO... "STILL HASN'T FOUND WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATURALLY, THIS TRAGIC INCIDENT SET OFF A WILD FRENZY OF SPECULATION THAT CAN ONLY  BE DESCRIBED AS THE "TODAY SHOW." (LAUGHTER)
CAN YOU IMAGINE FINDING BONO'S LUGGAGE?
HOW EXCITING. DRESSING LIKE A ROCK STAR. YOU'RE PLOWING THE FIELDS, NEXT THING YOU KNOW, BONO'S LUGGAGE FALLS FROM THE SKY.
Stephen: YEAH, I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE MINDING YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND, SUDDENLY, A BUNCH OF BONO'S STUFF DROPS INTO YOUR LIFE? (LAUGHTER) ONLY IF YOU BOUGHT THE NEW iPhone. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OR IF YOU'RE ME, BECAUSE THROUGH MY CONNECTIONS AT THE GERMAN EMBASSY, I HAVE ACQUIRED BONO'S LUGGAGE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S VERY COMPLICATED. FOLKS, FOLKS, THIS IS WHAT WE CALL AN EXCLUSIVE. 'CAUSE EVERYONE'S SEEN U2 PERFORMING ON TELEVISION, BUT NOBODY'S SEEN ME RIFLING THROUGH BONO'S  UNDIES. (CHEERING) OR I SHOULD SAY, PAUL DAVID HEWSON'S UNDIES. YOU KNOW HOW I KNEW THAT WAS HIS NAME? IT'S ON HIS UNDIES. (LAUGHTER) WHAT ELSE WE GOT IN HERE? TOWELS. LOOKS LIKE HE STOLE A LOT OF TOWELS FROM A HOTEL HERE WE GO, WE'VE GOT A POST-IT NOTE REMINDING HIM OF THE NON-EDGE BAND MEMBER'S NAMES. (LAUGHTER) AND THIS IS NICE, IT'S A HANDWRITTEN LIST OF HISTORICAL TRAGEDIES THAT WOULD MAKE GOOD SONGS. (LAUGHTER) I ALSO HAVE THE EDGE'S DUFFLE BAG. LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT IN HERE, WE'VE GOT THE KNIT CAP, KNIT CAP -- (LAUGHTER) IT'S ALL KNIT CAPS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ANYWAY, GUYS, I'D BE HAPPY TO MAIL THESE BAGS TO YOU, BUT I KNOW YOU LIVE WHERE THE STREETS HAVE NO NAME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE THUNDERING HERD TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER) 'COURSE, ME HAVING THAT LUGGAGE IS A MAJOR SCOOP BECAUSE, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN THE THICK OF WHAT WE IN THE TV BIZ CALL "SWEEPS," WHEN BROADCASTERS PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS TO BOOST RATINGS. OVER THE YEARS, THEY'VE TRIED EVERYTHING FROM ADORABLE ANIMALS TO ON-AIR COLONOSCOPIES, TO LESBIAN KISSES, TO NEIL CAVUTO'S TOPLESS WEEK. BUT AS A BROADCAST JOURNALIST,  I BELIEVE ALL THAT ARE JUST CHEAP PUBLICITY STUNTS, AND SO DO THESE LESBIAN PUPPIES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) AND HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH SWEEPS, THESE LESBIAN PUPPIES ARE GONNA GIVE ME A RECTAL EXAM. I'M GONNA JAM A VIENNA SAUSAGE UP THERE AND LET THEM DIG FOR POLYPS. ANYWAY THAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT. SO SET YOUR TiV0s. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BLOWING IT OUT FOR RATINGS, NO ONE BLOWS HARDER THAN "GOOD MORNING AMERICA." THEIR ACTUAL NEWS GUY, MATT GUTMAN, DEDICATED MUCH OF LAST WEEK TO SOMETHING EVERY AMERICAN CAN RELATE TO -- FIGHTING OFF BEARS AND SHARKS.
BACK NOW AT 7:42 WITH THE KICKOFF OF GMA SURVIVAL WEEK. WE HAD TO SPEND A DAY WITH A 1,300-POUND GRIZZLY. I EVEN FELT ITS HOT BREATH ON MY FACE. THIS TIME I HAD TO JUMP INTO THE DEEP END TO LEARN HOW TO FEND OFF SHARKS WITH MY HANDS AND FEET. THIS MORNING, WE ASK WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THE PLANE YOU WERE ON PLUNGED INTO THE WATER?
YES, THAT IS NEWS YOU CAN USE. NOW I KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THE PLANE I'M ON CRASHES INTO SHARK INFESTED WATERS, AND THE PILOT IS A GRIZZ! (LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, YOU KNOW I BELIEVE BEARS ARE GODLESS KILLING MACHINES. OKAY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT WAS THESE BEAR TIPS I FOUND PARTICULARLY USEFUL.
I'M SPEECHLESS RIGHT NOW. THIS IS A 1,300-POUND GRIZZLY BEAR WRESTLING WITH A 200-POUND MAN.
WRESTLE! WRESTLE!
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU SEE A MAN PUT HIS HEAD INSIDE A GRIZZLY'S MOUTH WILLINGLY. DOES IT HURT TO HAVE YOUR HEAD INSIDE OF A BEAR'S MOUTH?
NOT REALLY. OKAY, KIDS. G.M.A. SAYS IF A BEAR IS ATTACKING YOU, THE BEST LINE OF DEFENSE IS TO LODGE YOUR HEAD IN ITS JAWS. AFTER YOU SLAP HIM SOME 69. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING) (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING) I THINK WE HAVE THE STATE DRUM LINE HERE TONIGHT! AND ONCE THE MAULING IS UNDERWAY, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS YOU CAN DO TO REMAIN MINIMALLY CHEWED.
YOU DON'T WANT TO SURPRISE THEM. YOU WANT TO LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE AREA. IF YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO CALCULATE, DO YOU RUN? DO YOU STAND?
NEVER RUN. ABSOLUTELY NEVER RUN UNDER ANY CONDITIONS. YOU WOULD TALK IN MONOTONES. I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG HERE. THEN SLOWLY BACK AWAY.
Stephen: YES, VERY IMPORTANT. TALK IN MONOTONES. (IN SOFT VOICE... ) HEY, BEAR, LET'S TALK THIS OUT. YOU'RE OKAY. YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT ME. I SAW A CHUBBY KID BACK DOWN THE TRAIL. YOU SHOULD EAT HIM. HERE'S SOME BARBECUE SAUCE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THESE G.M.A. TIPS ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO SURVIVE AN ATTACK THAT G.M.A. JUST AS CRITICALLY ADMITS WILL NEVER HAPPEN.
EXPERTS SAY YOU'RE 250 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE OF A LIGHTNING STRIKE THAN A BEAR ATTACK.
THAT MAY BE. BUT THERE'S AN EASY WAY TO REDUCE YOUR CHANCES OF DYING FROM LIGHTNING. SINCE IT NEVER STRIKES TWICE, MAKE SURE TO GET STRUCK BY LIGHTNING ONCE. AND, FOLKS, IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS MORE DANGEROUS THAN SHARKS AND BEARS. FOR INSTANCE, SHARKS INJURE ABOUT 13 AMERICANS A YEAR. WHILE AS MANY AS 13,250 ARE HURT BY BUCKETS AND PAILS. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE DANGER COULD BE LURKING IN YOUR CLOSET. TONIGHT, I LAUNCH MY OWN RATINGS-BOOSTING SURVIVAL SEGMENT.
EPIC PAIL, TO HELL IN A HAND BUCKET.
Stephen: TONIGHT, I'M GONNA TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM GETTING CROSSED OFF A BUCKET'S BUCKET LIST. LET'S BRING HIM OUT. OKAY, EVERYBODY STAY CALM. OKAY. THERE WE ARE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THIS HERE IS GOLIATH. HE'S A 2.5-GALLON GALVANIZED MALE, AS YOU CAN CLEARLY TELL. WHILE BUCKETS ARE POWERFUL, THEY CAN BE APPROACHED SAFELY, IF YOU OBSERVE THESE TIPS. FIRST, NEVER SURPRISE THE BUCKET. ALWAYS LET IT KNOW YOU'RE APPROACHING. HEY, BIG FELLA. HI! HI! HOW ARE YA? YEAH, I WAS THINKING ABOUT MAYBE WASHING THE WINDOWS! (LAUGHTER) NEVER RUN. UNDER ANY CONDITIONS. THE BUCKET CAN'T FOLLOW YOU. AND YOU WILL NO LONGER BE WITH THE BUCKET. EVERYBODY STAY CALM. ALL RIGHT. AND NEVER SPEAK DIRECTLY INTO THE BUCKET. HELLO! SEE? YOU HEAR THAT? SEE? IT ECHOES AND YOUR SOUND GUY WILL NOT LIKE IT. (LAUGHTER) IF YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS, THERE'S NO REASON YOU AND THE BUCKET CAN'T MAKE FRIENDS. WATCH THIS. HEY, FELLA! HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? HEY, WRESTLE, WRESTLE. SEE? WE'RE HAVING FUN. I CAN EVEN PUT MY HEAD IN HIS MOUTH. HEY, HEY, NO, IT'S OKAY! SEE? WE'RE HAVING FUN. OH, GOD!  OH GOD, IT'S GOT ME! JAY THE INTERN! JAY THE INTERN, SAVE ME! SOMEBODY PLEASE! WHY DIDN'T G.M.A. WARN ME ABOUT THIS?! GOOD MORNING AMERICA,  YOU SHOULD'VE WARNED ME ABOUT BUCKETS! THANK YOU, JAY! OH, JAY! OH, JAY, THE INTERN! YOU SAVED ME. WHAT! I, STEPHEN COLBERT, WAS SAVED BY... A BEAR? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL THIS TIME, I HAVE BEEN WRONG ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE NOT HERE TO KILL US, YOU'RE HERE TO HELP. ON BEHALF OF ALL BEARS, WILL YOU FORGIVE ME? (CHEERING) (SINGING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ (LAUGHTER)
AHHH! HEY! YOU'RE LEAVING? I WAS GOING TO MAKE BREAKFAST. OH... YOU'RE LATE FOR WORK IN THE FOREST. OKAY. WELL, UM... CALL ME, OKAY? (LAUGHTER) HE'S TOTALLY GONNA CALL ME.
