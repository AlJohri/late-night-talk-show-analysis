Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, PLEASE, NATION, LAST  WEDNESDAY'S DEBATE PROVED MITT  ROMNEY'S MASTERY OF ECONOMIC  POLICY. BUT FOREIGN POLICY IS MORE OF A  CHALLENGE FOR MITT. WE ALL REMEMBER WHEN HE VISITED  ENGLAND, SUGGESTED THE OLYMPICS  WERE DISORGANIZED, TOLD THE  PRESS ABOUT A SECRET MEETING WITH M.I.-6 AND THEN MOTOR  BOATED HER MAJESTY. (LAUGHTER)  EMBARRASSING. PROTOCOL DICTATES THAT ONES  HANDS REMAIN AT ONE'S SIDES WHEN  BUTTERING THE ROYAL CRUMPET. (LAUGHTER)  BUT IN A SPEECH YESTERDAY, MITT  PROVED HE KNOWS WHAT AMERICANS  WANT IN INTERNATIONAL  RELATIONS-- VAGUE, LONG-WINDED  THREATS.
IN AFGHANISTAN I'LL EVALUATE  CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND AND  WEIGH THE BEST ADVICE OF OUR  MILITARY COMMANDERS. IN LIBYA I'LL VIGOROUSLY PURSUE  THE TERRORISTS WHO ATTACKED OUR  CONSULATE IN BENGHAZI. IN SYRIA I'LL WORK TO IDENTIFY  AND ORGANIZE THOSE MEMBERS OF  THE OPPOSITION WHO SHARE OUR  VALUES. AND THEN ENSURE THAT THEY OBTAIN  THE ARMS THEY NEED. WE MUST MAKE CLEAR TO IRAN  THROUGH ACTIONS NOT JUST WORDS  THAT THEIR NUCLEAR PURSUIT WILL  NOT BE TOLERATED.
Stephen: FOUR MORE WARS! FOUR MORE WARS! FOUR MORE WARS! FOUR MORE WARS! YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS? JUST TWO MORE AND I'LL PUNCH  CARD. (APPLAUSE)  AND WE GET A FREE SUB. (LAUGHTER)  OF COURSE, MITT'S STRONGEST  LANGUAGE WAS SAVED FOR IRAN.
I'LL PUT THE LEADERS OF IRAN  ON NOTICE THAT THE UNITED STATES  AND OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES WILL PREVENT THEM FROM ACQUIRING  NUCLEAR WEAPONS CAPABILITY.
Stephen: MITT WILL PUT THE  LEADERS OF IRAN ON NOTICE! ONE OF THE STRONGEST THINGS A  PRESIDENT CAN DO NEXT TO DOING  SOMETHING! (LAUGHTER)  AND, FOLKS, AFTER HE IS GRATED,  MITT WILL HAVE FULL ACCESS TO  THE PRESIDENT PRESIDENTIAL ON-NOTICE BOARD. IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THEY  TEACH YOU THE FIRST DAY IN  OFFICE-- ALONG WITH THE LAUNCH  CODES AND HOW TO JIGGLE THE HAND UNTIL THE LINCOLN BEDROOM TOILET  SO IT FLUSHES. (LAUGHTER)  I'M AFRAID WE MIGHT NOT HAVE  THAT KIND OF TIME. ROMNEY WILL NOT BE PRESIDENT  UNTIL JANUARY. AND BY SOME ACCOUNTS IRAN IS  ONLY 60 DAYS FROM BEING 30 DAYS  AWAY FROM BEING 10 DAYS AWAY  FROM HAVING A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND HAS BEEN FOR YEARS. (LAUGHTER)  SO AS USUAL SAVING THE WORLD  FALLS TO ME. BOYS, BRING OUT THE ON-NOTICE  BOARD. LET'S DO IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  OKAY. (APPLAUSE)  LET'S SEE HERE, LET'S SEE HERE. OKAY. WE'VE GOT IRA GLASS, ISLETS OF  LANGERHANS, ILLEN COMMA. HERE IT IS, IRAN'S LEADERS. ALL RIGHT, YOU READY? YOU READY, IRAN'S LEADERS? MULLAH THIS OVER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BOOM! IRAN, YOU ARE OFFICIALLY ON  NOTICE! FORGET OBAMA'S WEAK-ASS ECONOMIC  SANCTIONS. MITT AND I MEAN BUSINESS. DON'T BELIEVE ME? ASK YOURSELF WHY JANE FONDA  DOESN'T HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
