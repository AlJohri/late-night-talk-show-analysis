Stephen: HEY WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMER SOLDIER WHOSE NEW NOVEL IS "RADIANCE OF TOMORROW." THAT'S EASY, IT'S THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF TOMORROW DIVIDED BY TWO TIMES PI OF TOMORROW. PLEASE WELCOME ISHMAEL BEAH.
NICE TO MEET YOU, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, MR. BEAH, MAY I CALL YOU ISHMAEL.
YES.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW, SIR, YOU, FROM AGE 13 TO 16, WERE A CHILD SOLDIER, IN SIERRA LEONE, CORRECT?
YES, I WAS.
OKAY, WE'RE UP AGAINST LETTERMAN AND CONAN SO, ANY FUNNY STORIES? THERE ARE PLENTY OF FUNNY STORIES.
ARE THERE REALLY? BUT THEY ARE VERY VERY DARK HUMOR THAT MOST PEOPLE MAY NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND.
OK, IS THERE ANY WAY TO KEEP IT LIGHT?
THERE COULD BE SOME WAYS.
OKAY.
THERE COULD BE SOME WAYS.
HOW DOES ONE BECOME A CHILD SOLDIER AT AGE 13?
WELL, IN MY COUNTRY YOU HAD A CIVIL WAR THAT STARTED WHEN I WAS 11.
OKAY.
WHERE IS SIERRA LEONE BY THE WAY,
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A COUNTRY.
MOST PEOPLE DON'T.
IT SOUNDED LIKE A MAKE OF STATION WAGON.
WE BECAME REALLY, REALLY REALLY REALLY FAMOUS BECAUSE OF THE WAR THAT WE HAD. PRIOR TO THAT, PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW THAT WE WERE THERE.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A CHILD SOLDIER? IS THERE AN ORGANIZED CHILD MILITIA OR IS IT MORE LIKE GUERRILLA GROUPS?
NO, WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN THERE IS A WAR IN THE COUNTRY AS THERE WAS IN MY COUNTRY IN SIEERRA LIONE, AT SOME POINT, THE GOVERNMENT ARMY, EVEN, EVEN THE REBEL GROUPS, THEY START RECRUITING CHILDREN. IN VARIOUS WAYS, SOMETIMES IT CAN BE BY FOOT, SOMETIMES IT WOULD KILL THEIR FAMILIES AND THEN THEY WOULD TAKE THEM INTO THE GROUP AND SOMETIMES IT'S YOUNG PEOPLE TRYING TO STAY ALIVE. BECAUSE IT BECOMES THE WAY TO LIVE, IF YOU ARE NOT PART OF ANY GROUP, YOU BECOME THE PREY FOR EVERYBODY. SO IN MY CASE I LOST MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY AND I WAS RUNNING FROM THE WAR, EVERYTHING I KNEW AS A CHILD HAD BEEN COMPLETELY DESTROYED, INCLUDING MY TOWN. AND THEN I WENT TO A MILITARY BASE TO LOOK FOR SAFETY ALONG WITH A GROUP OF OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE, AND THIS IS WHERE WE WERE TRAINED. IN THE MIDDLE OF WAR YOU ARE TRAINED.
SO IT'S NOT LIKE REGULAR SOLDIERS WHERE YOU TRAIN FOR YEARS AND SOMETIMES NEVER GO TO BATTLE. YOU ARE TRAINED WHILE YOU ARE HEARING THE GUNSHOTS.
SO THEY GIVE YOU A GUN AND SAY GO OUT AND TRAIN.
EXACTLY. NO I MEAN THEY TRAIN YOU LITERALLY JUST HOW TO SHOOT, AND THEN YOU LEARN ON THE JOB.
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOURSELF?
NOT YET.
OKAY. WHEN YOU DO, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE TRUMP CARD OF ALL TRUMP CARDS. THEY'RE GOING TO SAY DAD, I DIDN'T GET AN X BOX ONE THIS CHRISTMAS, AND YOU WILL SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I GOT FOR CHRISTMAS WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, AN AK-47.
YOU WROTE ABOUT THIS, A BOOK CALLED, "LONG WAY GONE."
YES.
LONG WAY GONE. YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED "THE RADIANCE OF TOMORROW." THAT'S A VERY HOPEFUL TITLE FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS A CHILD SOLDIER AND HAS SEEN THE HORRORS OF WAR. ARE YOU A HOPEFUL PERSON, LIKE ARE YOU HOPEFUL FOR YOUR HOME COUNTRY OF SIERRA LEONE.
I AM VERY HOPEFUL. I'M HOPEFUL FOR A LOT OF THINGS. I'M HERE SO THAT IN ITSELF IT'S PROOF THAT HOPE IS...
HOW DID YOU GET HERE? HOW DOES ONE STOP BEING A CHILD SOLDIER?
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE. IN MY CASE I WAS REMOVED FROM THE FIGHTING BY UNICEF AND I ACTUALLY DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE BECAUSE IT'S ALL I'D COME TO KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE WAS POSSIBLE. AND AT THIS POINT IN MY COUNTRY THE WAR WAS STILL GOING ON. SO THEY REMOVED ME. AND MY COMMANDERS HAD TO GIVE ME UP AND I WENT AND I WENT TO REHABILITATION, FINISHED, AND EVENTUALLY I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES AND NEW YORK.
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION WHEN YOU LEFT. WHEN YOU GOT ON THE PLANE, WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION?
I'D NEVER BEEN ON A PLANE BEFORE. IT WAS VERY COLD. I TURN ON THE AIR AND I DIDN'T TURN ON THE AIR, THE AIR WAS COMING OUT. AND NOBODY TOLD US, NOBODY GAVE US ANY ORIENTATION WHATSOEVER. SO I WAS THERE WITH ANOTHER YOUNG FELLOW AND WE KEPT THINKING TO OURSELVES YOU KNOW, WE SURVIVED THIS WAR AND WE ARE GOING TO DIE ON THIS. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY COLD. ON THE PLANE, YOU KNOW.
VERY COLD.
WERE YOU IN COACH?
WE WERE IN COACH. SO SORRY, SO SORRY. WHICH WAS WORSE?
HUH?
THE CIVIL WAR, A CIVIL WAR OR COACH, WHICH ONE.
I WOULD TELL YOU, ACTUALLY A LOT OF THINGS WERE VERY, VERY JUST-- STRANGE TO US. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE GOT TO NEW YORK IT WAS WINTER OF '96, I'M FROM A PLACE WHERE IT DOESN'T GET COLDER THAN 60 DEGREES, I ARRIVE HERE.
WOW.
BACK IN SIERRA LIONE, WHAT FRUIT DO THEY USE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW COLD IT IS?
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO, BECAUSE OUR WEATHER, OUR WEATHER, I DON'T THINK WE EVEN HAVE PEOPLE FOR WEATHER REPORT, BECAUSE-- TOMORROW WILL BE NICE AND THE NEXT DAY AND THE DAY AFTER THAT, YOU KNOW.
THIS IS A NOVEL ABOUT A MAN OR TWO FRIENDS WHO GO BACK TO SIERRA LEONE TO THE LIFE THAT THEY USED TO LIVE, TO SEE THE PEOPLE THEY USED TO KNOW DURING THE CIVIL WAR.
YES. RADIANCE OF TOMORROW REALLY TALKS ABOUT, WHY DO PEOPLE GO BACK AFTER WAR, WHY DO THEY GO BACK TO THEIR OWN COUNTRIES. BECAUSE I BEGAN TO OBSERVE AFTER MY FIRST BOOK THAT MOST PEOPLE WERE VERY INTERESTED WHEN THE PLACE HAD COLLAPSED. BUT NO ONE TALKS ABOUT IT WHEN THE GUNS SILENCE. AND PEOPLE GO BACK. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME. HOW DO YOU GO BACK AND START LIVING AGAIN. WHAT TRADITIONS DO YOU HOLD ON TO. HOW DO YOU MOVE TOWARDS THE FUTURE WHEN THE PAST IS PULLING AT YOU. SO I HAVE A FEW CHARACTERS. I HAVE THE ELDERS, THEY'RE THREE OLDER PEOPLE AND THEN THERE ARE TWO YOUNG MEN, ONE OF THEM IS TRYING TO KEEP HIS FAMILY TOGETHER THROUGHOUT THE NARRATIVE, AND THEN OF COURSE ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH THAT. SO THE IDEA OF THE RADIANCE OF TOMORROW, REALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN IS OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE THINK ABOUT PEACE OR HAPPINESS IN ONE'S LIFE AS THE ABSENCE OF ANY CHALLENGE. THAT'S NOT TRUE. EVERY DAY A HUMAN LIFE YOU HAVE TO FACE SOME CHALLENGES. SOME CHALLENGES MAY BE BIGGER THAN OTHERS THAT DOESN'T MEAN ARE YOU NOT HAPPY. IN THE BACKDROP OF ALL THAT PEOPLE FIND TIME TO LOVE EACH OTHER, TO HAVE FUNNY MOMENTS IN THEIR LIVES, TO RAISE FAMILIES, AND TO MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES. AND THIS IS POSSIBLE. SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT I AM TRYING TO GET AT IN THIS BOOK. AND ALSO USING LANGUAGE WITH MY OWN CULTURE AND MY OWN TRADITION. BECAUSE I COME FROM THE AURAL TRADITION AS WELL. AS A BOY, I WOULD SIT AROUND THE FIRE EVERY EVENING AND THE OLDER PEOPLE WOULD TELL STORIES. AND IT WAS QUITE BEAUTIFUL. SO I TRIED TO SHOW SOME OF THAT AS WELL.
WHAT DO YOU MISS MOST ABOUT SIERRA LEONE?
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING. THE FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. IF I WAS THERE I WOULDN'T BE COLD RIGHT NOW.
WELL, ISHMAEL BEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THE BOOK IS "THE RADIANCE OF TOMORROW." ISHMAEL BEAH, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
