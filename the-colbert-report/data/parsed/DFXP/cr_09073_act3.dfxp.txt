Stephen: JOHN SEXTON WILL  YOU BE MY GUEST?
OH, YES!
Stephen:.
WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT STUFF YOU  SAID TO ME IN THE FANTASY SUITE? I DESERVE HAPPINESS, TOO! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME NYU  PRESIDENT JOHN SEXTON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BOOM! BOOM! MR. SEXTON THANK YOU FOR COMING  BACK. CAN I CALL YOU JOHN?
JOHN IS IT.
Stephen: JOHN, THANK YOU  FOR COMING BACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF NYU AND  ALSO A TEACHER THERE AND YOUR  NEW BOOK "BASEBALL AS A ROAD TO GOD" IS BASED ON A COURSE YOU  TAUGHT THERE WHAT DO YOU MEAN  BASEBALL AS A ROAD TO GOD? JESUS SAID THAT NO ONE GETS TO  THE FATHER BUT THROUGH ME. ARE YOU SAYING THAT JESUS IS  BASEBALL? BECAUSE THERE'S NO JESUS IN  BASEBALL -- THERE'S SOME HEY-SUS  BUT THERE'S NO JESUS IN  BASEBALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE POINT OF BOOK IS,  STEPHEN, TO GO DIRECTLY AT THE  PROPOSITION YOU PUT ON THE  TABLE. I'M A CATHOLIC.
Stephen: I'M THE CATHOLIC. [LAUGHTER]
THE POINT HERE IS THAT THOSE  OF US THAT WERE TAUGHT AS WE  WERE THAT WE HAD THE TRUTH, WITH A CAPITAL T.
Stephen: WHICH WE DO.
SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE  HUMBLE ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: I AM. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND OPEN OURSELVES UP TO THE  FACT THAT BASEBALL IS A ROAD TO  GOD JUST AS OUR RELIGION IS A ROAD TO GOD JUST AS BUDDHISM IS  A ROAD TO GOD AND THE MORE  IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE ALL GET USED TO FINDING GOD IN THIS  WORLD.
Stephen: HOW IS BASEBALL  ANYTHING LIKE -- GOD DOES NOT  TAKE NINE INNINGS.
BUT GOD, LIKE BASEBALL, IS  TIMELESS.
Stephen: BASEBALL FEELS  TIMELESS. [LAUGHTER]
SEE NOW, THE KEY THAT I'M  TRYING TO GET AT IN THIS BOOK IS  THE FACT THAT -- WHAT WE AS HUMAN BEINGS SHOULD BE DOING IS  SEARCHING FOR MEANING. FREQUENTLY MEANING IS THAT WHICH  WE CAN LEARN AND PUT IN A MIND,  ESPECIALLY A WONDERFUL MIND LIKE  YOURS. [LAUGHTER] BUT FREQUENTLY THE REAL MEANING  OF LIFE CAN'T BE PUT IN  COGNITIVE TERMS. THERE'S A WORD I USE IN MY  COURSE AND IN THE BOOK IT CAN'T  BE REDUCED TO WORDS. WE EXPERIENCE IT. THE WAY WE KNOW WE'RE IN LOVE,  FOR EXAMPLE. THE WAY WE KNOW LIFE AS MEANING.
Stephen: I LIKE THAT INHE  HAVABLE THING BECAUSE I CAN SAY  SOMETHING IS TRUE AND GO, I CAN'T SCHAIN IT, I'M RIGHT  THOUGH -- I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. I'M RIGHT THOUGH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND MANY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: I'M INEFF ABLE  ABOUT EVERYTHING.
I KNOW. YOU HAVE PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE  HEART OF THE MATTER BECAUSE  THERE IS THE KNOWN. SO WE KNOW NOW THE WORLD IS NOT  FLAT. THERE'S THE KNOWABLE THAT WE  DON'T YET KNOW BUT WE'LL KNOW  BECAUSE OF THE ADVANCEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE AND SCIENCE OVER THE  CENTURIES. BUT THEN THERE'S IS THE  UNKNOWABLE. AND WHAT I TRY TO GET AT IN THIS  BOOK IS THAT WE APPRECIATE THAT  WHICH CAN'T BE PUT INTO COGNITIVE TERMS, LIKE LOVE,  WHICH WE KNOW THROUGH EXPERIENCE  AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. AND WE DON'T CONFUSE AS WE  SOMETIMES ARE TEMPTED TO DO THE  UNKNOWABLE FROM THAT WHICH WE SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW YET.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS  THAT I DON'T KNOW IS WHAT YOU  JUST SAID. I'M SURE THAT'S ME. I'M SURE THERE'S PEOPLE WHO GO  TO NYU WHO UNDERSTOOD WHEN YOU  JUST SESMED I WANT TO TALK ABOUT  LOVE. WE CAN'T KNOW LOVE BUT IF  BASEBALL IS A ROAD TO GOD AND  GOD IS LOVE, BASEBALL HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE A ROAD TO LOVE  BECAUSE YOU WANT TO, YOU KNOW,  IF YOU ARE WITH A GIRL YOU WANT TO GET ON FIRST BASE. AND THEN SECOND BASE AND THEN  THIRD PLACE. AND IF YOU MAKE IT ALL THE WAY  HOME, SUDDENLY YOU WANT TO START  THINKING ABOUT BASEBALL! SO IT'S A PERFECT CIRCLE. IT'S A PERFECT CIRCLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JOHN SEXTON THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR BEING HERE. JOHN SEXTON "BASEBALL HAS A ROAD  TO GOD."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAU
