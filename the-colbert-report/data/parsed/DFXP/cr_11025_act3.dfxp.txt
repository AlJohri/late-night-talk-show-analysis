Stephen: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. YOU'RE A GUY WHO'S A RABBLE ROUSER, YOU WHIP PEOPLE UP. (LAUGHTER) THAT MAY PLAY IN VERMONT, BUT THERE IS TALK YOU MAY BE THROWING YOUR HAT INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL RING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SIR, I ONLY HAVE 15 MORE SHOWS, IF YOU WANT THE COLBERT BUMP. (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU READY TO DECLARE TONIGHT IN FRONT OF THESE GOOD PEOPLE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I CAN'T CONTROL THEM! THEY LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE ON MY SHOW. (LAUGHTER) WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE SOME NEWS?
THE NEWS IS I AM THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A CAMPAIGN MANAGER. IS HE DOING NOTHING? IS THAT JUST SOCIALIST HANDOUTS? (LAUGHTER)
WE HAVEN'T PUT ANYBODY ON THE CAMPAIGN STAFF YET. WHAT WE HAVE TO ASCERTAIN IS WHETHER OR NOT IN THIS COUNTRY THIS IS THE APPETITE AND THE WILLINGNESS TO PUT TOGETHER A STRONG GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT TO TAKE ON THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING, AND WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE UNLIMITED SUMS OF MONEY, THE QUESTION IS HOW YOU RAISE THE $20 AND $40 CONTRIBUTIONS THE MONEY YOU NEED TO RUN A SERIOUS CAMPAIGN. THOSE ARE THE ISSUES WE'RE LOOKING AT.
Stephen: OKAY. YOU BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT CAN... ACHIEVE THINGS? (LAUGHTER) A CONTROVERSIAL STANCE.
YES.
Stephen: CAN YOU NAME A COUNTRY WHERE THAT'S WORKED OUT?
I THINK ONE OF THE SAD THINGS ABOUT AMERICAN POLITICS IS WE DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN A NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES. IN DENMARK, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES QUALITY CARE FOR ALL ITS PEOPLE WITHOUT OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSE, AT A TIME WHEN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE BY THE MILLIONS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME AFFORDING TO GO TO COLLEGE, ARE GRADUATING DEEPLY IN DEBT, IN DENMARK, COLLEGE AND GRADUATE SCHOOL IS WITHOUT ANY OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I DO WANT TO POINT ONE THING OUT TO YOU, SENATOR, IS THAT DENMARK HAS 5.5 MILLION PEOPLE, AND I HAVE MORE THAN THAT ON MY TWITTER FEED. SO I'M GOING TO TWEET SOMETHING HERE TONIGHT. HOLD ON. SUCK IT, DENMARK. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. FOLKS, RETWEET THAT. IF I GET MORE RETWEETS THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE IN DENMARK,  YOU HAVE TO MOVE THERE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME! SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS -- MAYBE FOR PRESIDENT! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
