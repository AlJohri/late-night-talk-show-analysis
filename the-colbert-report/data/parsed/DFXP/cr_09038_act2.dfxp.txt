Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, YOU KNOW AS WE SAY  GOOD-BYE TO 2012 I'M GOING  TO TAKE A MOMENT HERE TO BID A FON FAIR WELL TO SOMEONE  WE LOST THIS YEAR. HAM ROVE, HAM WAS CHIEF  STRATEGIST AND PRINCIPAL  LUNCH METAPHOR COLBERT SUPER  PAC. THEN LAST MONTH TRAGEDY  STRUCK WHEN HE FELL  REPEATEDLY ON TO A KNIFE  THAT I WAS HOLDING. BEFORE WE COULD GET HIM TO A  TOOK TORE HE WAS EATEN BY A  DOG. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH  HAM MEANT TO ME. WELL, TECHNICALLY COY BUT  IT'S A SUPER PAC SO LEGALLY  I DON'T HAVE TO. JUST LIKE I DON'T HAVE TO  TELL YOU WHERE THE  773,704.83 OF SUPER PAC  MONEY WENT. I JUST HOPE AND PRAY THEY'RE  BOTH IN A BETTER PLACE NOW. WELL THAT BRINGS ME TO THIS  LETTER THAT I RECEIVED FROM  A GROUP CALLING ITSELF THE HAM ROVE MEMORIAL FUND,  WHICH I WAS SURPRISED TO  LEARN I AM ON THE BOARD OF. NOW IN THE LETTER THAT I  SENT TO ME IT SAYS THAT THE  FUND WAS FOUNDED TO HONOR  HAM'S MEMORY WITH CHARITABLE  GIFTS. AND RECENTLY THE FUND  RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS  DONATION OF $773,704.83. NOW WHERE DID THAT SPECIFIC  AMOUNT OF CASH COME FROM? WELL, IT IS A ITS IT CAME  FROM PO BOX BITE ME. (LAUGHTER)  NOW AS A BOARD MEMBER I  WANTED THAT MONEY TO GO TO  UNICEF. UNFORTUNATELY THE REST OF  THE BOARD FOUND OUT THAT  UNICEF IS THE NAME OF MY  YACHT. (LAUGHTER)  KEEP COLLECTING THOSE  PENNIES, KIDS. SO INSTEAD TONIGHT I'M PROUD  AND SOMEWHAT SHOCKED TO  ANNOUNCE THAT THE HAM ROVE MEMORIAL FOUNDATION WILL BE  GIVING $125,000 EACH TO  DONNERS CHOOSE SANDY RELIEF FUND TEAM RUBICON SANDY  OUTREACH AND HABITAT FOR  HUMANITY WHICH IS BUILDING  HOUSES FOR STORM VICTIMS. THE FUND IS ALSO GIVING  $125,000 TO THE YELLOW  RIBBON FUND WHICH HELPS  INJURED SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILY, THE REMAINDER  OF THE MONEY AS PER HAM  ROVE'S WISHES WILL BE SPLIT BETWEEN THE CENTER FOR  RESPONSIVE POLITICS AND THE  CAMPAIGN LEGAL CENTER. NOW YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY HAM  ROVE, THE BRAINS AND OTHER  ORGAN NEEDS BEHIND MY SUPER PAC WOULD DONATE TO GROUPS  FIGHTING FOR  CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM. WELL, THERE ARE SOME STRINGS  ATTACHED. HAM STIPULATED THAT THE TWO  GROUPS GET THE MONEY ONLY IF  THEY NAMED THE CONFERENCE ROOM AT THE CENTRE FOR  RESPONSIVE POLITICS THE  COLBERT SUPER PAC MEMORIAL  CONFERENCE ROOM AND IN THE CAMPAIGN LEGAL CENTER THEY  WILL NOW HOLD THEIR MEETINGS  IN THE HAM ROVE MEMORIAL CONFERENCE ROOM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND FOLKS, JUST THINK. AS THE TIDAL WAVE OF MONEY  CONTINUES TO ENGULF POLITICS  AND THESE ADVOCATES FOR TRANSPARENCY ARE MOANING  ABOUT HOW POWERLESS THEY ARE  TO STOP IT, LITTLE HAM HERE WILL BE UP ON THAT WALL  WATCHING THE WHOLE THING  UNFOLD WITH RELISH. AND MAYBE A LITTLE DIJON. BUT ALAS IT IS TIME TO SAY  GOOD-BYE TO OUR HERO. SO DON'T BE SAD, NATION. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A  LITTLE BIT OF HAM ROVE IN  OUR HEARTS AND ALSO AROUND  OUR HEARTS. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
