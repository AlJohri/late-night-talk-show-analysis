Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A MATHEMATICIAN WHO HAS A NEW BOOK OUT ABOUT LOVE AND MATH. I'LL ASK HIM IF ONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER. PLEASE WELCOME EDWARD FRENKEL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SOMETIMES THESE PEOPLE DESERVE A DOUBLE DIP. NOW YOU DESERVE IT TOO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: AS DO YOU BECAUSE ARE YOU A VERY IMPRESSIVE GUY BUT IN WAYS THAT I DON'T THINK I'M QUALIFIED TO JUDGE, OKAY. BECAUSE YOU NEED NO INTRODUCTION, OBVIOUSLY BUT I WILL DO IT ANYWAY, YOU ARE A PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AT THE  UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKLY. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE HERE THAT YOU ACTUALLY WORKED ON THE FREE FIELD REALIZATIONS OF KAC-MOODY ALGEBRAS--  (APPLAUSE)
ALSO YOU DEFINED THE QUANTUM DRIMFELD SOKOLOV PRODUCTION AND DESCRIBED THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSAL DEVELOPING ALGEBRA OF A WALKING MODULE TO GREAT A GROUND BREAKING FRENKEL ALPHA MORPHISM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HUGE, HUGE, THE PEOPLE HERE, THEY ARE MORE FELDMAN FANS THAN FRENKEL.
IT IS LIKE RED WINE, YOU CAN ENJOY SOMETIMES. SO I THINK THEY ARE FANS.
Stephen: PERHAPS OVER A PIECE OF POACHED SALMON YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED LOVE AND MATH, THE HEART OF HIDDEN REALITY. WHAT THE HELL DOES LOVE HAVE TO DO WITH MATH BECAUSE SPOILER ALERT, I HATED MATH  AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY, BECAUSE MATH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MY OPINION. WHY SHOULD I LOVE IT.
WELL, THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT, STEPHEN. BECAUSE I HEAR IT QUITE OFTEN. EVEN FROM SUPERSMART AND SUPERINTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO WOULD NEVER SAY I HATE ART. OR I HATE MUSIC.
Stephen: I HATE SOME ART, SOME MUSIC.
BUT IT'S OKAY IN OUR SOCIETY TO SAY I HATE MATH.
Stephen: SO MATH IS LIKE ART TO YOU.
MATH IS LIKE ART. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WHEN YOU SAY I HATE MATH, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
Stephen: WHOSE FAULT IS BECAUSE I LOVE BLAMING PEOPLE FOR THINGS.
IT'S MY FAULT.
Stephen: YOUR FAULT.
I SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS BOOK A LONG TIME AGO.
Stephen: SO IF I READ THIS I WILL LOVE MATH.
I HOPE SO. WHEN PEOPLE SAY I HATE MATH, WHAT YOU REALLY SAYING IS I HATE THE WAY MATHEMATICS WAS TAUGHT TO ME. IMAGINE IN ART CLASS. IN WHICH THEY TEACH YOU ONLY HOW TO PAINT A FENCE OR A WALL BUT NEVER SHOW YOU THE PAINTINGS OF THE GREAT MASTERS. THEN OF COURSE YEARS LATER YOU WILL SAY I HATE ART. WHAT YOU WOULD REALLY BE SAYING IS I HATE PAINTING A FENCE. AND SO IT IS WITH MATH. WHEN PEOPLE SAY I HATE MATH, WHAT THEY ARE REALLY SAYING IS I HATE PAINTING A FENCE.
Stephen: BUT IN MATH DON'T I HAVE TO KNOW A FAIR AMOUNT OF HIGH END MATH TO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE MASTERS. IT'S ALMOST AS IF, YOU KNOW, YES, YOU COULD SHOW ME A PAINTING BY A MASTER, BUT I DON'T HAVE EYEBALLS YET. DON'T YOU NEED TO SORT OF GROW THE MATH EYEBALLS TO SEE THE EQUATIONS AS BEAUTIFUL?
THAT'S OUR JOB. YOU KNOW, ONE OF MY TEACHERS A GREAT TEACHER WOULD SAY-- USED TO SAY, YOU KNOW F YOU ASK A DRUNKARD WHICH NUMBER IS BIG TWO, TWO-THIRDS OR THREE FIFTHS HE WON'T TELL YOU, BUT IF YOU ASK HIM WHAT IS BETTER, TWO BOTTLE OF VODKA FOR -- HE WILL TELL YOU RIGHT A WAP. TWO BOTTLES. COURSE. SO I TRY TO-- .
Stephen: THAT IS A LEVEL OF MATH THAT PERHAPS ONLY RUSSIANS CAN DO. (APPLAUSE)
TRUE. I COME FROM RUSSIA.
Stephen: YES.
FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.
Stephen: FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.
AN MATH.
Stephen: NOW IN RUSSIA, IS MATH THE SAME AS IT IS HERE OR OVER THERE IS IT 2 PLUS 2 IS WHATEVER PUTIN SAYS IT IS?
I'M NOT THE ONE TO SPEAK FOR PUTIN.
Stephen: YES, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO BACK. I UNDERSTAND-- UNDERSTAND. OKAY. YOU NOT ONLY SOMEONE WHO WRITES PASSIONATELY, YOU ACTUALLY HAVE PERFORMED PASSIONATELY. YOU DID A THE RIGHT OF LOVE AND MATH, AN EROTIC JOURNEY INTO THE BEAUTY OF NUMBERS AND THE HUMAN FORM. WHICH FEATURES YOU NAKED AND WITH EQUATIONS ON THE BODY OF YOUR LOVER. ISN'T THAT A LITTLE CONSERVATIVE FOR A PROFESSOR AT BERKELEY.
WHAT WOULDN'T I DO TO EXPOSE THE BEAUTY OF MATHEMATICS.
Stephen: LET'S SHOW THE PEOPLE YOU WHAT DID
Stephen: LET'S SHOW THE PEOPLE YOU WHAT DID (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I MIGHT HAVE HIT THE BOOKS A LITTLE BIT HARDER AS A CHILD AM NOW IS THAT FOR GENERAL AUDIENCES, CAN KIDS WATCH THIS. THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO GET TEENAGERS HOOKED ON MATH.
WELL, IF THE FILM MAKES VIEWERS WANT TO EMBRACE MATHEMATICS, SO BE IT.
Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU WRITING ON THAT POOR WOMAN'S STOMACH. WHAT IS THAT EQUATION THERE?
WELL, IN THE FILM, SHE REPRESENTS MATHEMATICS
Stephen: SHE'S MATH?  I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.
THE FILM IS ABOUT A LOVE AFFAIR THAT IS US DOING MATHEMATICS, IT IS A LOVE AFFAIR. AND SHE REPRESENTS THE TRUTH IN MATHEMATICS WHICH IS WE SACRIFICE OURSELVES. AND THE PREMISE OF THE FILM IS THAT THE MATHEMATICIAN FOUND THE FORMULA OF LOVE. THE FORMULA SO POWERFUL THAN HE REALIZED THAT HE REALIZED THIS COULD BE USED NOT ONLY FOR GOOD BUT ALSO FOR ILL. SO THEN HE UNDERSTANDS THAT HE HAS TO PROTECT THE FORMULA. HE HAS TO HIDE IT. FROM THE POWERS THAT BE WHO COULD MISUSE IT. COULD MISUSE THE FORMULA AND THAT'S WHY HE DECIDES TO TATTOO IT ON THE BODY OF THE WOMAN HE LOVES.
Stephen: AND THEN, AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO HER? DO THE BAD GUYS CHASE HER AND --
YOU HAVE TO SEE THE FILM.
Stephen: I SAW SOME OF IT. I SAW-- I CAN'T ACTUALLY SHOW THE PEOPLE BECAUSE ITS GOT YOUR NAKED BUTT IN IT. DO ALL MATHEMATICIANS HAVE AN ASS THAT HIGH AND TIGHT?
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
Stephen: I NEVER DID MATH AND THE RESULTS WERE DISASTROUS. EDWARD FRENKEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE BOOK IS LOVE AND MATH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
