WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS HARVARD  PROFESSOR. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "COOL  WAR."  IT'S LIKE THE COLD WAR, BUT  EVERYONE IS WEARING SKINNY  JEANS. PLEASE WELCOME NOAH FELDMAN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HEY, NICE TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING BACK,  DR. FELDMAN.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: NOW, FOR THE  PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT REMEMBER THE  LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO, LET'S SAY,  THANKS FOR COMING BACK. YOU'RE THE BEEMISPROFESSOR OF  INTERNATIONAL LAW, A HARVARD  RHODES SCHOLAR. MUST HAVE SOME ELASTIC IN YOUR  OLD SMARTY PANTS OVER THERE,  MAYBE AN ESCALATOR IN YOUR IVORY  TOWER. ALL RIGHT, YOUR NEW BOOK IS  CALLED "THE COOL WAR: THE FUTURE  OF GLOBAL COMPETITION." WHAT'S THE COOL WAR? WE HAD A COLD WAR, WE KICKED AS,  WE TOOK NAME, WE WON IT. WHAT'S THE COOL WAR?
IN A COLD WAR, YOU CAN'T  ATTACK YOUR ENEMY BECAUSE YOU'RE  AFRAID YOU'LL EACH BLOW EACH  OTHER. IN A COOL WAR, YOU NEED YOUR  ENEMY. YOU'RE COMPLETELY  INTERDEPENDENT. WE NEED CHINA TO KEEP LENDING US  MONEY.
SO CHINA IS THE ENEMY IN THE  COOL WAR?
IT IS. THEY NEED US AS MUCH TO KEEP ON  BUYING THEIR PRODUCTS SOME WE'RE  TOTALLY INTERDEPENDENT. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY ARE  RISING FAST, AND THAT WOULD LIKE  TO BE A GLOBAL SUPERPOWER, AND WE'RE THE ONLY GLOBAL  SUPERPOWER, AND WE DO NOT WANT  SOMEBODY ELSE TO JOIN US AT THE  TOP. THAT'S A RECIPE FOR CONFLICT.
Stephen: AFTER I SAW THOSE  2008 GAMES IN BEIJING, SCARED  THE... [LAUGHTER] ...THE HOY SIN SAUCE OUT OF ME. SHOULD I BE SCARED OF CHINA?
YES, YOU SHOULD BE SCARED. I'M SCARED.
Stephen: YOU'RE SCARED OF  CHINA?
I AM SCARED.
Stephen: WHAT SCARES YOU? WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO TO US?
WHAT SCARES ME IS THEY WOULD  VERY CREDIBLY LIKE TO BECOME THE  MOST IMPORTANT POWER IN ASIA, HALF THE WORLD'S POPULATION.
Stephen: HOW ARE THEY NOT?
WE'RE STILL THE MOST  IMPORTANT POWER IN ASIA.
Stephen: OH, WOW. ONE FOR US. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. I LIKE THAT.
WE'RE STILL THE ONE WHO HAVE  THE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS. WE ORGANIZE REGIONAL SECURITY,  BUT THEY WOULD LIKE THE CHANGE  ALL THIS. THE WAY TO DO THAT IS KEEP ON  GROWING AND GROW THEIR MILITARY  AT 10% A YEAR, WHICH THEY'VE BEEN DOING, AND TO WAIT UNTIL A  DAY COMES WHEN THEY SAY, GEE, WE  WOULD LIKE TAIWAN TO BE PART OF CHINA AND WE SAY, OKAY, WHAT ARE  WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT?
Stephen: WHAT DO WE SAY  NOW? NOW WE SAY, WE'D RATHER NOT TALK  ABOUT IT, RIGHT?
YEAH. WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL A POSSE OF  STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY. WE HAVEN'T SAID WE ARE GOING TO  WAR. WE HAVEN'T SAID WE WON'T GO TO  WAR. THE IDEA IS THAT WILL STOP CHINA  FROM TRYING TO TAKE OVER TAIWAN. SO FAR IT'S WORKED.
Stephen: OKAY.
SO FOR WHAT THAT'S WORTH, IT  HASN'T HAPPENED. THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG WILL  THAT REALISTICALLY LAST?
Stephen: HOW LONG WILL THAT  REALISTICALLY LAST? THAT WAS ACTUALLY MY NEXT  QUESTION.
I THINK IT WILL LAST UNTIL  CHINA'S MILITARY...
Stephen: GIVE ME A DID A,  DADDY-O. GROW A PAIR. WHAT DATE DOES IT END? 30 YEARS, HOW LONG?
IF WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE  AGAINST CHINA, IT MAY NEVER  HAPPEN. WE'RE TRYING TO STOP THAT FROM  HAPPENING.
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS  STRUGGLE. YOU SAY IT'S CODEPENDENCE. WE KNOW THEY'RE OUR BIG TRADING  PARTNER. WHAT DO WE NEED FOR THEM?
WE NEED THEM TO LOAN US  MONEY. THEY OWN 8% OF OUR NATIONAL  DEBT, WHICH IS MORE THAN ANYBODY  IN THE U.S.
Stephen: BRAZIL OWNS A TON  OF OUR DEBT. ENGLAND OWNS A TON OF OUR DEBT.
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO CALL  BULL [BLEEPED] ON THAT. I THINK BRAZIL OWNS A BUNCH TOO. CAN SOMEONE CHECK TO SEE IF I'M  RIGHT? THEY SAID I'M RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] WAIT A SECOND. NO, NO, LISTEN, LISTEN, YOU'RE  THE HARVARD GUY, I'LL GIVE YOU  THAT ONE. LET ME ASK YOU THIS, AS A KID,  AND HOWL ARE YOU?
43.
Stephen: YEAH, AS A KID,  GROWING UP, WE'RE NEVER GOING TO  GET OFF OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL, RIGHT, WE'LL BE  SLAVES AND CHAINS. THEY'RE GOING TO OWN OUR WOMEN  AND THEIR HAREMS IN SAUDI ARABIA  BECAUSE WE'LL NEED THEIR OIL. NOW WE'RE FRACKING NORTH DAKOTA. WE GOT MORE OIL THAN WE KNOW  WHAT TO DO WITH IN THE FUTURE. THERE'S PLENTY OF OIL OUT THERE. WE CAN SELL THIS TO OTHER  PEOPLE. IS THERE ANYWAY WE CAN FRACK OUR  ECONOMY AND NO LONGER BE  DEPENDENT ON THE CHINESE AND WE FLIP THE SCRIPT AND CHINA IS  DEPENDENT UPON US FOR SALES, BUT  WE DON'T NEED THEIR CASH, GAME  OVER.
IT'S A GREAT PLAN.
Stephen: THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
BUT WHAT I THINK IS THAT IN  THE REAL WORLD THAT WOULD MEAN  WE WOULD BORROW EVEN MORE OF OUR OWN MONEY. WE WOULD OWN EVEN MORE OF OUR  OWN DEBT.
Stephen: WHO WINS? LOOK INTO YOUR CRYSTAL BALL. WHO WINS THIS ONE?
WE DON'T KNOW WHO WINS.
Stephen: AMERICA WINS. THE ANSWER IS AMERICA WINS. HOW DO WE WIN? IF THAT'S NOT YOUR ANSWER, THEN  THINK ABOUT THAT ONE. HOW DO WE WIN IT?
THE WAY WE WIN AND THE WAY  EVERYONE COULD REALLY WIN WOULD  BE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE MUTUALLY  INTERDEPENDENT AND TRY TO USE  THE LEVERAGE OF THE FACT THAT EVERYONE WOULD LOSE IN A WAR TO  TRY TO STOP THEM FROM FIGHTING  US AND STOP US FROM FIGHTING  THEM.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT THE  FRENCH SAID TO THE NAZIS OVER  VICHY. THEY SAID, "WE WILL COOPERATE  WITH YOU."
THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS THAT  CHINA IS KNOTTS EASY GERMANY --  NAZI GERMANY. CHINA IS AUTHORITARIAN. IT'S NOT A DICTATORSHIP. THEY CHANGE THEIR LEADERSHIP  EVERY TEN YEARS.
THEY'RE COMMIES.
THEY WERE ONCE COMMIES.
Stephen: YOU'RE BUYING  THAT? YOU SWALLOWED THAT WHOLE, WE'RE  NOT COMMIES THING.
THEY'RE DEFINITELY A RULING  PARTY.
Stephen: IT'S CALLED THE  COMMUNIST PARTY.
BUT THEY'VE ADMITTED  CAPITALISTS TO MEMBERSHIP.
THEY'RE JUST CAPITALISTS  PERIOD.
THEY SEEM TO BE ALL IN ON THE  CAPITALISM FRONT.
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN, WILL YOU COME BACK IF WE  GET TO WAR WITH CHINA?
THAT WOULD BE THE LEAST OF  OUR PROBLEMS. I'LL BE HERE.
Stephen: THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOAH FELDMAN. THE BOOK IS "THE COOL WAR."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
