[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK  CALLED AMERICA'S UNWRITTEN  CONSTITUTION. HE'S RIGHT THE CONSTITUTION  WASN'T WRITTEN. IT WAS DICK DATED BY JESUS. PLEASE WELCOME AKHIL REED AMAR. THANK YOU. MR. AMAR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE SHOW IN A  FEW YEARS. YOU ARE ONE OF THESE EAST COAST  IVY LEAGUE LIBERAL EDUCATORS,  RIGHT? YOU TEACH AT YALE.
GUILTY AS CHARGED.
Stephen: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE YOURSELF A NEW BOOK  HERE CALLED "AMERICA'S UNWRITTEN  CONSTITUTION:  THE PRECEDENT AND PRINCIPLES WE LIVE BY."  WHAT DO YOU MEAN UNWRITTEN  CONSTITUTION. THE CRIEWTION IS A --  CONSTITUTION SAY DOCUMENT, THE  WORDS OF WHICH WE LIVE BY. HOW CAN WE LIVE BY AN UNWRITTEN  ONE?
WELL, I HAVE IT HERE.
Jon: THE CONSTITUTION. THERE, YES --
Stephen: THE CONSTITUTION,  YES I'M FAMILIAR. IT'S A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION,  OKAY?
YOU BELIEVE IN STUFF THAT IS  NOT QUITE THERE THAT YOU THINK  COMPLETES IT.
Stephen: IF IT'S NOT IN  HERE, GO TO HELL.
HOW ABOUT LIMITED GOVERNMENT.
Stephen: OF COURSE LIMITED  GOVERNMENT.
IT DOESN'T SAY THAT.
Stephen: IT'S LIMITED BY  WHAT IS IN HERE. IT IS A LIMITATION CHECK MATE. KEEP GOING.
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE  WORDS OF DOCUMENT WE ALSO HAVE  TO UNDERSTAND THE SPIRIT AND THAT'S PART OF THE UNWRITTEN  CONSTITUTION. I'M WITH YOU. I DON'T WANT US TO LOSE THE  VIRTUES OF A WRITTEN  CONSTITUTION.
Stephen: YOU JUST LOST THIS  ONE IT'S MINE NOW. THIS SOUNDS LIKE WHERE ARE THE  OTHER IDEAS COMING FROM THAT YOU  CLAIM AREN'T IN HERE?
THAT'S THE TRICK. HOW CAN WE GO BENEATH, BEYOND  AND BEHIND THE DOCUMENT WITHOUT  LOSING FAITH WITH THE DOCUMENT? WHAT YOU.
Stephen: YOU ARE TALKING  ABOUT JUDICIAL ACTIVEY. IF YOU ARE ASSIGNING RIGHTS THAT  ARE NOT IN HERE IS THE  DEFINITION OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM.
READING THE THING HAS A  WHOLE. LET'S TAKE A QUESTION FOR  EXAMPLE WHO PRESIDES AT THE VICE  PRESIDENT'S IMPEACHMENT? THE TEXT SAYS THE VICE PRESIDENT  PRESIDES OVER THE SENATE AND THE  SENATE TRIES ALL IMPEACHMENTS. DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE VICE  PRESIDENT WOULD PRESIDE OVER HIS  OWN IMPEACHMENT.
Stephen: YES, THAT IS WHY  NO VICE PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN  IMPEACHED. HAS ANY VICE PRESIDENT EVER BEEN  IMPEACHED?
NO.
Stephen: CHECKMATE AGAIN. I SHOULD TEACH AT YALE. OKAY. OKAY.
YOU ARE DOING A GOOD JOB.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. GO AHEAD. WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE?
SO HOW ABOUT UNENUMERATED  RIGHTS.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW THAT  WORD.
IT MEANS NOT LISTED.
Stephen: IT SAYS ANYTHING  YOU KNOW SET FORTH HERE SHALL GO  TO THE SEVERAL STATES, RIGHT?
IT SAYS ANYTHING NOT LISTED  HERE SHALL NOT BE DENIED OR  DISPARAGED.
Stephen: THEY COVERED THAT.
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY COVERED IT  BY SAYING WE DIDN'T LIST ALL THE  RIGHTS. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS  ABOVE AND BEYOND THE ONES WE  LISTED. LIKE, WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT THE  STATES CAN'T VIOLATE THE RIGHT  TO HAVE A GUN IN YOUR HOME? YOU BELIEVE IN HAVING A GUN IN  YOUR HOME?
Stephen: I BELIEVE IN  HAVING A GUN EVERYWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT STATES  CAN'T MESS WITH THAT RIGHT?
Stephen: IT SAYS -- YOU ARE  CONFUSING ME. YOU ARE SAYING IT SAYS THAT THE  STATES HAVE TO OBEY FEDERAL LAW.
AND SO FEDERAL LAW DOESN'T  SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.
Stephen: THE SECOND  AMENDMENT SAYS IT.
SO THE FEDS HAVE NO LAW AT  ALL ON THIS AND NOW NEW YORK,  JUST IMAGINE HYPOTHETICALLY NEW YORK PASSES A LAW THAT RESTRICTS  GUN RIGHTS.
Stephen: THEY DID.
DOES THE SECOND AMENDMENT  PROTECT. THAT IS ONLY ABOUT THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT. WHAT ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS AGAINST  STATE GOVERNMENTS? IT TURNS OUT THERE'S A PASSAGE  OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT TALKS  ABOUT RIGHTS AGAINST STATE GOVERNMENT BUT DOESN'T LIST  THEM. IT SAYS NO STATE SHALL MESS WITH  OR ABRIDGE ANY PRIVILEGES OR  IMMUNITIES OF CITIZENS. IT DOESN'T SPECIFY WHAT THEY  ARE. THOSE ARE UNWRITTEN TO SOME  EXTENT.
Stephen: WHERE IS THIS THE  UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION? IS THAT THE PLOT OF THE THIRD  NATIONAL TREASURE MOVIE? DOES NICK CAGE FIND IT TATTOOED  ON HIS BACK? HOW DO YOU KNOW? YOU MAY HAVE A POINT HERE.
LET'S TAKE THE PRESIDENCY ALL  PRESIDENT DOZEN A WHOLE BUNCH OF  THINGS THAT ARE NOT SPELLED OUT IN SO MANY WORDS BUT THAT GEORGE  WASHINGTON D. BEING ABLE TO  SWEAR THEIR OATH OF OFFICE ON A  BIBLE.
Stephen: IT'S WRITTEN IN  THERE.
IT'S NOT IN THE WRITTEN  CONSTITUTION.
Stephen: IT'S NOT?
IT'S NOT BUT GEORGE  WASHINGTON --
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME. AKHIL REED AMAR, "AMERICA'S  UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
