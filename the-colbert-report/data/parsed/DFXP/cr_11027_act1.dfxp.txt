Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO THE REPORT, HEROES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. ALWAYS A PLEASURE. ALWAYS A JOY.   ( CHEERS ) FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE COMING TO YOU EVERY NIGHT OF THE WEEK, MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT BROADCASTING LEGEND ISN'T MY MOST IMPORTANT JOB. I'M ALSO A DAD. THAT I KNOW OF. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHY I HAVE THE RIGHT TO JUDGE TODAY'S OVER-INVOLVED HELICOPTER PARENTS. IF YOU'RE THAT NEUROTIC ABOUT YOUR KID'S SAFETY, WHY DID YOU GIVE THEM A HELICOPTER IN THE FIRST PLACE? ( LAUGHTER ) THEY HAVE CREATED-- THESE PARENTS HAVE CREATE A GENERATION OF SCAREDY KIDS WHO QUIVER AT THE SLIGHTEST ARMED INVASION.
NOW TO FLORIDA TONIGHT WHERE PARENTS ARE OUTRAGED AFTER POLICE ENTERED A MIDDLE SCHOOL WITHOUT WARNING WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE GUNS DRAWN. BUT WHAT THEY FOUND OUT NEXT HAS MANY ANGRY TONIGHT. IT WAS A DRILL.
POLICE WITH AR-15 RIFLES LIKE THIS ONE, BURST INTO CLASSROOMS. CHILDREN AND TEACHERS BELIEVED THEY WERE REALLY UNDER ATTACK.
STUDENTS, SOME TEXTING THEIR PARENTS FOR HELP, THEY WERE TERRIFIED.
Stephen: TYPICAL TEENS-- CAN'T EVEN STOP TEXTING AT GUNPOINT. ( LAUGHTER ) FOR PETE'S SAKE! WE'VE GOT VISITORS! PUT THE PHONE DOWN AND CRAP YOUR PANTS. ( LAUGHTER ) MANNERS. LOOK, I KNOW THESE DRILLS CAN BE UPSETTING, BUT THEY SERVE A VITAL PURPOSE. COPS GET TRAINING RESPONDING TO SCHOOL EMERGENCIES, AND IN THE EVENT OF A REAL TRAGEDY, THE KIDS WILL BE GLAD THEY HAD ALL THOSE PRACTICE NIGHTMARES. ( LAUGHTER ) BESIDES, SCHOOL OFFICIALS HAD GOOD REASON TO GIVE THESE KIDS P.T.S.D.-- OR PRETEND TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. JIM?
POLICE SAY THE DRILLS ARE ALWAYS HELD WITHOUT ADVANCE WARNING BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY CAN EVALUATE A SCHOOL'S RESPONSE.
SCHOOL OFFICIALS INSIST THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE IS IMPORTANT, NOTING, UNFORTUNATELY, NO ONE GETS AN ADVANCED NOTICE OF REAL-LIFE EMERGENCIES.
Stephen:  IT'S TRUE. THERE IS NO ADVANCE NOTICE IN A REAL-LIFE EMERGENCY. WHICH IS WHY I NEVER WARN MY STAFF ABOUT OUR FIRE DRILLS. I DON'T EVEN WARN MYSELF. I LEAVE A PILE OF OILY RAGS NEXT TO THE FURNACE, AND I WAIT FOR THE DRILL TO START WHEN IT'S READY. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'RE-- WE'RE ACTUALLY ON OUR FIFTH STUDIO HERE. THAT'S WHY THE SHOW IS ENDING. I CAN'T GET INSURANCE. ( LAUGHTER ) ANYWAY, NATION, I HAVE LONG BEEN A PROPONENT OF SMALL GOVERNMENT. AS THOMAS JEFFERSON SAID, THAT GOVERNMENT IS BEST WHICH GOVERNS LEAST, WHICH MEANS OUR CONGRESS IS HEADED TOWARDS PERFECTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: GOOD JOB, CONGRESS. WE LOVE YOU, CONGRESS. OF COURSE, AMERICA HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF PATRIOTS STANDING UP AGAINST GOVERNMENT OVERREACH. WHERE WOULD WE BE IF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS HADN'T  RISEN UP AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF KING GEORGE? TECHNICALLY, WE'D STILL BE RIGHT HERE. THAT'S HOW GEOGRAPHY WORKS. BUT WE'D ALL BE WEARING ABSURD WIGS INSTEAD OF JUST DONALD TRUMP. TONIGHT, FOLKS, I AM PROUD TO PROFILE THE LATEST GROUP OF HEROS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO GIVE BIG GOVERNMENT AN OVER-REACHAROUND. JIM?
AMERICA IS UNDER SIEGE.
OUR GOVERNMENT IS A TYRANNY AND IT'S OUT OF CONTROL, AND IT MUST BE STOPPED.
IT REALLY IS GOVERNMENT OVER-REACH, GOVERNMENT GONE AMOK.
THIS BIG BROTHER HAS GOTTEN A LOT CREEPIER THAN GEORGE ORWELL THOUGHT IT WOULD EVER GET.
TYRANNY IS ON THE RISE. BUT THESE BRAVE PATRIOTS ARE FIGHTING BACK. THEY ARE DIFFERENCE MAKERS.  ♪  ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IN THE HEART OF NEW HAMPSHIRE LIES THE SMALL TOWN OF KEENE, A PRETTY PLACE, WHERE THE IRON FIST OF AUTHORITY HAS RUN AMOK. BUT HELP IS ON THE WAY. MEET THE FREE KEENE SQUAD. JAMES CLEVELAND-- A.K.A.--
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT I'M THE MASTERMIND.
"THE MASTERMIND." GARRET EAN.
I WOULD IDENTIFY MYSELF AS AN ANARCHIST.
THE AFROCHIST. CHRIS CANTWELL.
THERE IS A 38-CALIBER REVOLVER IN A HOLSTER  AND I CARRY IT ON MY HIP. (GUNSHOT)
THE ENFORCER. THE FREE KEENE SQUAD HAS A CLEAR PLAN TO FREE THE PEOPLE OF KEENE. TELL THEM, MASTERMIND.
FREE KEENE ISN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT FREEING PEOPLE PER SE. IT'S-- ( LAUGHTER )
A POWERFUL VISION FOR A BETTER TOMORROW. WE CONFRONTED JACKBOOTED CITY COUNCILOR RANDY FILIAULT FOR A RESPONSE.
FREE KEENE CLAIMS THEY'RE FREEING KEENE FROM SOMETHING. MOST OF US THAT HAVE LIVED HERE ALL OF OUR LIVES REALLY HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT PART OUT YET. AND QUITE HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK THEY'VE REALLY FIGURED IT OUT YET. SO IF THEY EVER DO FIGURE IT  OUT, I WISH THEY'D GIVE US A CALL.
RING-RING, RANDY. YOU BETTER GET THE PHONE BECAUSE THEY FIGURED IT OUT.
PARKING METERS.
YOU HEARD HIM RIGHT, PARKING METERS.
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT, I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE THAT THEY SHOULD DO A-- KIND OF THE BASICS. THEY SHOULD DEFEND LIFE, LIBERTY, AND PROPERTY. AND I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW ISSUING PARKING TICKETS MEETS ANY OF THOSE GOALS.
SO FREE KEENE SPRANG INTO ACTION BY RUNNING AHEAD OF METER MAIDS AND PUTTING COINS IN THE METERS BEFORE THEY EXPIRE. THEY CALL IT "ROBIN HOODING." THEY'VE BEEN FILMING THEMSELVES DOING IT FOR YEARS. AND THEY HAVE POSTED HUNDREDS OF CLIPS ON THE WEB, SOME OF WHICH HAVE GOTTEN MULTIPLE VIEWS.
I GUESS I'M THE ROBIN HOOD. I FEEL LIKE I'M A SUPER HERO. I'M OUT THERE DOING GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY.
WHICH HAS THE TYRANNICAL CITY GOVERNMENT SHAKING IN THEIR BOOTS.
PROBABLY THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE WASN'T THEM PLUGGING A METER. QUITE HONESTLY, NONE OF US CARED. WHAT WE CARED ABOUT WAS THEY WERE FOLLOWING AROUND THE METER ATTENDANT AND HARASSING THEM.
THEY'RE NOT HARASSING. THEY'RE ANNOYING FOR LIBERTY.
HEY, WHY ARE YOU GOING THAT WAY? WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO.  YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET AWAY WITH IT TODAY
YOU TAKE MONEY FROM PEOPLE BY FORCE. WHY DO YOU BEHAVE THIS WAY? I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN  APPROPRIATE THING FOR PEOPLE TO DO TO EACH OTHER.
I WOULD LIKE TO YOU STOP FOLLOWING ME AROUND.
NOBODY LIKES WHAT YOU DO. IT'S A CRAPPY POSITION TO BE IN, IN YOUR LIFE.
GO BACK TO YOUR TRUCK AND DRIVE AWAY.
I'M DOING MY JOB.
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT.
Stephen: YES, THIS MAY LOOK LIKE THE FREE KEENE SQUAD ARE BEING TOTAL DICKS TO INNOCENT METER MAIDS, BUT IF THAT WERE  TRUE, WHY DOESN'T ANYONE STOP THEM?
I FIND WHEN I CARRY A GUN, PEOPLE ARE VERY UNLIKELY TO HIT ME. YOU CAN SAY ALMOST WHAT YOU WANT ENTIRELY TO PUBLIC OFFICIALS. YOU CAN'T THREATEN TO KILL THEM, BECAUSE THAT'S-- THAT'S, LIKE, COERCION. THAT'S EXTORTION. THAT'S AN INITIATION OF FORCE.
I BELIEVE THEY REALLY LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING. >>, OF COURSE, BEING NEW ENGLANDERS, THE PEOPLE OF KEENE ARE RESERVED IN THEIR DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION.
WHY ARE YOU HARASSING HER?
GET THAT AWAY FROM ME RIGHT NOW!
GET OUT OF MY FACE.
STOP HARASSING PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING.
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A FREELOADING HOBO.
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
OH,.
AND THE WAY YOU TREAT PEOPLE SHOWS ME YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS WALK AWAY.
NO, YOU DON'T EVEN WANNA KNOW -- ( BLEEP ).
OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING, AND I'M FINE WITH THAT. I THINK IT'S, LIKE-- TO ME, IT'S LIKE A BALANCE. LIFE IS LIKE THE YIN-YANG. I FEEL LIME I'M THE YIN, I'M THE WHITE PART, I'M THE GOOD PART.
Stephen: AND EVERY YING HAS ITS YANG
MY NAME IS ALLEN GIVEITZ, I WAS A POLICE OFFICER IN THE U.S. ARMY RESERVES. I WAS IN IRAQ AND KUWAIT ABOUT 15 MONTHS.
AND THIS VETERAN NEEDED A JOB.
I SEE AN AD FOR THE CITY OF KEENE FOR PARKING ENFORCEMENT. AND I KIND OF CHUCKLED AT FIRST, AND I SAID, YEAH, OKAY, I'M GOING TO BE A MALE METER MAID. YOU SORT OF FEEL LIKE YOU'RE KIND OF AN ANIMAL IN A CAGE, REALLY.
WATCH WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU'RE RUNNING INTO PEOPLE.
NO, I'M NOT.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A BREAK THE ENTIRE DAY. THIS IS NEVER GOING TO STOP.
IT WAS HELL. BEING CALLED A THIEF. BEING CALLED A LIAR. THAT SORT OF STUNG A LITTLE. BUT IT DIDN'T STING AS MUCH AS, YOU KNOW, BEING CALLED A COWARD. DEFINITELY DIDN'T HURT AS BAD AS BEING CALLED A RACIST BECAUSE OF MY VETERAN STATUS. I WAS TOLD THAT I CONDONE THE DRONING OF BROWN BABIES BECAUSE I'M A VETERAN. THAT STUNG.
OKAY, GRANTED, THESE GUYS ARE A-HOLES, BUT THEY'RE A-HOLES FOR FREEDOM. YOU'RE A VETERAN. I'M SURE YOU CAN HANDLE IT. I MEAN, IT'S NOT WORSE THAN IRAQ.
WHAT WAS WORSE, SERVING IN IRAQ OR BEING A METER MAID IN KEENE? ( LAUGHTER ) BOY. IT'S REALLY A TOUGH QUESTION. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SPOILER ALERT: IT'S KEENE BECAUSE AFTER A YEAR OF ABUSE,
YES, I QUIT
Stephen: AND FREEDOM...WON? THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT. IS THAT A TYPO.
FREEDOM CAN BE MESSY. FREEDOM IS NOT PERFECT. THERE ARE BAD THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE FREEDOM. I'M NOT GOING TO DENY THAT.
YOU CANNOT BE FREE FROM AN IDEA SO THERE CAN BE NO FREEDOM FROM FREE KEENE FOR PEOPLE WHO JUST LIVE HERE.
THEY HELPED FREE ME FROM MY JOB. THAT'S FOR SURE.
Stephen: SO FOR FIGHTING FOR THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS  TO BE TOTAL ( BLEEP ) STAINS,
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A BREAK THE ENTIRE DAY.  THIS IS NEVER GOING TO STOP. NEVER GOING TO STOP.
THE FREE KEENE SQUAD ARE TONIGHT'S DIFFERENCE MAKERS. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, ARE HUGE DOUCHEBAGS.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
