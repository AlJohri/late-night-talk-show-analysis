Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT THE MAN BEHIND FOX NEWS AND THE GOOD EL FIDDLE CONTEST THAT MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE. PLEASE WELCOME. DAVID, THANKS SO MUCH. HUGE, HUGE FALLKENFLICK FANS, IN 2004 YOU HAVE BEEN NPR'S MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, YOU'RE MORNING EDITION, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. YOU'RE ON THERE WITH YOUR NPR LIBERAL BIAS TALKING ABOUT THE MEDIA RIGHT, ALL RIGHT? WELL, THE MEDIA BIAS HAS BLED OUT TO YET ANOTHER BOOK. THIS ONE CALLED MURDOCH'S WORLD, THE LAST OF THE OLD MEDIA EMPIRES. OKAY. I'LL BITE. WHAT IS SO TERRIBLE ABOUT RUPERT MURDOCH?
HE'S A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN.
SURE.
Stephen: IS THAT YOUR PROBLEM WITH HIM BECAUSE HE'S PROFIT AND YOU WORK FOR A NONPROFIT? ARE YOU JEALOUS, IS THIS JEALOUSY.
NOT SOME OF. THIS IS ABOUT A GUY WHO I THINK IS IN MANY WAYS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MEDIA FIGURE IN THE ENGLISH SPEAK WORLD.
Stephen: EXCUSE ME --.
NO, NO, NO. GO AHEAD, WE'LL EDIT THAT OUT. HE IS THE GUY WHO HAS BENT POLITICIANS TO HIS WILL, SENT PEOPLE SPEAKING TO BE PRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTERS, EVEN ASPIRING POPES TO TRAVEL THOUSANDS OF MILES TO MEET WITH HIM.
Stephen: POPES? HE'S GOT THE POPE ON A ROPE?
ONE OF THE MANY THINGS YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT MURDOCH HE IS HE AND ACTUALLY A PAPAL KNIGHT.
Stephen: THE KNIGHT OF MALTA.
HE WAS GIVEN A PAPAL KNIGHTSHIP IN 1998 IN I BELIEVE IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF HIS PHILANTHROPY TOWARDS THE ARCHDIOCESE OF LOS ANGELES. HERE IS A GUY WHO HAS ACTUALLY FASCINATINGLY NAKED WOMEN ON PAGE 3 OF THE LARGEST SELLING DAILY IN THE U.K., THE SUN TABLOID AND ALSO HONORED BY THE POPE.
Stephen: JUST ON PAGE 3 SHOWING WHAT GOD GAVE THEM. ALL RIGHT SO, HOW MUCH DOES HE OWN, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PROPERTIES HE OWNS.
.
Stephen: OR WHAT DOESN'T OWN.
IN THIS COUNTRY THE THINGS WE KNOW BEST, "THE NEW YORK POST", "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL," ONE OF THE BEST NEWSPAPERS IN THE RECORD, A LITTLE FAMILIAR. AND FOX NEWS. IN THE U.K. HE CONTROLS OVER A THIRD THIRD OF ALL NATIONAL NEWSPAPER SERKLATION. IN AUSTRALIA HE CONTROLS BETWEEN 65 AND 70% OF MAJOR DAILY NEWSPAPER CIRCULATION SO HE IS A MAJOR FIGURE IN THE TWO OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL AS OUR OWN.
Stephen: WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO CROSS SOMEBODY THAT POWERFUL. BECAUSE I'M GUESSING YOU SAY SOME THINGS IN HERE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HIS TEAM OF INTERNET ATTACK DOGS COME AFTER YOU FOR.
I WILL BE LOOKING FOR THE RESPONSE OF YOUR SPAM BUT I THINK IN SOME WAYS-- .
Stephen: SPAM BOTHS ARE CRAVING FOX NEWSMENT I WILL SHOW YOU SOME OF THE LATEST ONES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES. SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE. ELIZABETH HASSLEBECK GROWINGLY PORTRAYS MICHELLE MALKIN AS SOMEONE WITH ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE OF HER OWN MONSTROSITY.
SEE, WHAT HUMAN WOULD COME UP WITH THAT I THINK RATHER THAN SAYING WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BE NEGATIVE ABOUT THIS GUY, I THINK HE'S FASCINATING AND COMPLEX. WHATTED REALLY LEAD ME TO HIM WAS AFTER COVERING NEWS OUTLET FORCE MANY YEARS IN 2011 A FEW SUMMERS AGO THERE WAS A HACKING SCANDAL IN THE U.K..
Stephen: I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT THAT ON FOX NEWS.
NOT SOME OF. SO IN THE U.K. ON TRIAL RIGHT NOW IS THE FORMER HAND-PICKED C.E.O. OF MURDOCH'S BRITISH NEWSPAPER DIVISION. AND ALSO THE FORMER EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE NEWS WORLD TABLOID WHICH USED TO BE THE LARGEST SELLING SUNDAY PAPER IN GREAT BRITAIN AND WENT ON TO THE CHIEF PR GUY FOR THE PRIME MINISTER, DAVID CAMERON. THEY ARE ON TRIAL FOR BREAKING INTO THE VOICE-MAIL MESSAGES OF PEOPLE IN THE U.K..
Stephen: IT'S CALLED INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM.
IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU GET THE INFORMATION ON THIS, DID YOU HACK INTO HIS PHONE.
I DID SOMETHING CALLED REPORTING. IT INVOLVED A LOT OF INTERVIEWS, WELL OVER 100 PEOPLE.
Stephen: BUT NOT EVERYTHING YOU COULD HAVE GOT.
IF YOU WOULD HAD HACK MOOD HIS PHONE MAIL WOW HAVE LEARNED MORE, TRUE OR FALSE.
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE LEARNED MORE, TRUE.
Stephen: SO THEY ARE BETTER JOURNALISTS THAN ARE YOU.
PERHAPS SO I THINK THAT-- I THINK A LOT OF FEEL IN GREAT BRITAIN THINK OTHERWISE BECAUSE AMONG THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HACKED.
Stephen: THEY'RE ENGLISH WHO CARES.
I KNOW BUT AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO WERE HACKED WERE NOT ONLY JUST CELEBRITIES, NOT ONLY POLITICIANS, SOWN AS UNIVERSITILY CORRUPT AND PHILANDERING BUT PEOPLE WHO WERE THE VICTIMS OF CRIMES, A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO HAD BEEN ABDUCTED AND MURDER HEAD HER PHONE HACKED AND IT TURNED OUT THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WERE TARGETED AS WELL. PEOPLE WHO WERE THE VICTIMS OF TERRORIST STRIKES, JULY 2005 IN THE. CAN.  BRITISH WAR DEAD IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN THERE WAS A YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS ALSO ABDUCTED AND KILLED. GIVEN A PHONE BY REBECCA BROOKS THE HEAD OF TABLOID THERE AND THEN SHE SAID YOU CAN CALL ME ANY TIME, USE THE CELL PHONE NOR ANYTHING YOU NEED, THAT PHONE WAS HACKED BY REBECCA'S OWN REPORTERS.
Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING THAT MURDOCH KNEW ABOUT THESE THINGS.
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.
Stephen: IT IS, I JUST ASKED IT.
SO THERE IS NO SENSE THAT MURDOCH FEW ABOUT THAT, THERE IS A SENSE THAT HE CONTINUALLY PUSHED THE TABLOID TO FIND OUT GREATER AND GREATER DEGREE OF GOSSIP AND NEWS. PUSHED THEM RELENTLESSLY IN AN AGE OF HAVING TO COMPETE AGAINST THE INTERNET SITES. BUT IT WAS ALSO IN A CULTURE IN WHICH HE HAD SO MUCH POWER THROUGH HIS NEWSPAPERS AND INFLUENCE IT AN POLITICS THAT POLITICIANS WERE UNWILLING TO CHECK ANY BEHAVIOR THAT WERE THE PROBLEM. IT TURNED OUT THAT ACCORDING TO CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS, A LOT OF POLICE WERE ON THE CASE TAKING BRIBES FROM MURDOCH'S JOURNALISTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF INCENTIVE TO FOLLOW ON JUST -- OBJECTIONS TO WHETHER THERE WAS ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR O YOU ARING CAN IT TURNED OUT TOP OFFICIALS HAD TO RESIGN IN THE WAKE OF THE REVELATIONS OF HACKING IN 2011 BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT THEY ACCEPTED THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN THINGS LIKE MEALS, THAT THE COMMISSIONER ACCEPTED A SPA TREATMENT WORTH OVER 13,000 POUNDS FROM A FRIEND OF REBECCA. AND SO-- .
Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE AT A SPA FOR 13,000 POUNDS.
APPARENTLY A VERY NICE SPA.
Stephen: THAT IS THE HAPPIEST ENDS I HAVE EVER HEARD OF. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH. DAVID, MURDOCH'S WORLD, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
