( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. MWA! FOLKS-- I CAN'T STOP THESE PEOPLE. I CAN'T STOP THEM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THANK YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'VE GOT A BIG SHOW TO DO. FOLKS, WE'VE GOT A BIG SHOW TO DO. I KNOW. I WOULD TRY TO STOP YOU FROM CHANTING BUT WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE TRIES TO STOP THE COLBERT NATION.   ( CHEERS ) THESE PEOPLE ARE LOCKED AND LOADED. FOLKS, SPEAKING OF WHICH, YOU KNOW I'M A PROUD SUPPORTER OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. I CONSIDER IT FIRST AMONG AMENDMENTS THAT AREN'T THE FIRST ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) THESE DAYS WE GUN ADVOCATES ARE BEING TREATED LIKE COMMON CRIMINALS
A 54-YEAR-OLD RESEARCH DOCTOR ARRESTED AFTER HE ENTERED AN AIRPORT TERMINAL CARRYING AN ASSAULT RIFLE. DR. PETER STEINMETZ WAS CARRYING AN AR-15 OVER HIS SHOULDER WHEN HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY LAST WEEK. HE TOLD POLICE HE VISITED THE AIRPORT TO SIMPLY BUY A CUP OF COFFEE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen, OF COURSE. YOU GOTTA GO TO THE AIRPORT FOR COFFEE. AIRPORTS ARE TO COFFEE AS BUS STATIONS ARE TO NACHOS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, YES, STEINMETZ MAY HAVE POINTED AN AR-15 ASSAULT RIFLE IN THE DIRECTION OF A MOTHER AND HER TEENAGED DAUGHTER, SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT A BRAIN SURGEON HERE. HE'S TECHNICALLY A TOP NEUROSCIENTIST. PERHAPS HE'S STUDYING THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT OVERRIDES IMPULSE CONTROL. THE POINT IS, ARRESTS LIKE THIS ARE PURE DISCRIMINATION, AND THAT HURTS THE CHILDREN. FORTUNATELY, TWO GUN LOVERS HAVE WRITTEN A NEW CHILDREN'S BOOK TO HELP KIDS UNDERSTAND THE OPEN CARRY LIFESTYLE. IT'S CALLED "MY PARENTS CARRY." ( LAUGHTER ) IT TELLS THE HEARTWARMING STORY OF BRENNA, HER MOM, AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE HER OTHER MOM WEARING A MUSTACHE. ( LAUGHTER ) UNLIKE OTHER PARENTS, BRENNA'S MOM AND DAD CARRY LOADED WEAPONS OPENLY, WHICH MIGHT MAKE HER FEEL DIFFERENT, BUT HER FATHER REASSURES HER THAT, "BRENNA, THERE IS EVIL IN THIS WORLD AND WE WANT TO PROTECT YOU THE BEST WE CAN. WHEN SECONDS COUNT, THE POLICE ARE MINUTES AWAY." WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BEDTIME STORY. THE WORLD IS FULL OF MANIACS WHO WANT TO HURT YOU AND THE POLICE CAN'T HELP. GOOD NIGHT, HONEY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) LET ME JUST OPEN THE WINDOW HERE SO YOU CAN GET A BREEZE, TURN OFF THE LIGHTS. GOOD-BYE. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, I KNOW THE KIDS ARE JUST GOING TO SPEND HOURS READING THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT'S FULL OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF WORDS. FOR INSTANCE, MOM AND DAD'S MORNING RITUAL. THEY RETRIEVE THEIR HANDGUNS FROM THE LOCKED GUN SAFE AND CHECK THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE LOADED. BRENNA'S PARENT WERE DRESSED CASUALLY. HER DAD WORE  A WHITE POLO SHIRT, TAN PANTS, A BLACK BELT AND COMFORTABLE SHOES HER MOM WORE WHITE CARGO SHORTS AND A NICE SHIRT AND HER WELL-WORN BROWN LOAFERS. THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A LOT OF SPECIFICS FOR A CHILDREN'S BOOK BUT REMEMBER A DETAILED DESCRIPTION IS IMPORTANT FOR THE POLICE REPORT. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, "MY PARENTS OPEN CARRY" IS LONG OVERDUE. I WISH THERE WERE MORE FIREARMS IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS. I MEAN LOOK AT  "THE VERY HUNGRY CATEPILLAR." SOMEONE IS CLEARLY OUT TO GET THIS GUY. THE ENTIRE BOOK IS RIDDLED WITH BULLET HOLES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OR HOW ABOUT "GOOD-BYE FOREVER, MOON." THAT'LL TEACH YOU TO LOOK THROUGH A KID'S WINDOW YOU PERV. OR BEST OF ALL, "WHERE THE WILD THINGS WERE." AND, FOLKS, FOLKS, THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS ALMOST UPON US AND I FOR ONE CAPTAIN WAIT TO SEE WHO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ELECT NEXT FOR JOHN BOEHNER TO SUE. OF COURSE, FORMER FIRST LADY, FORMER SENATOR, AND FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON IS THE CURRENT FRONT-RUNNER, WHICH IS SURPRISING SINCE IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE CAN'T HOLD DOWN A JOB. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, SECRETARY CLINTON SAYS SHE HASN'T MADE UP HER MIND ABOUT WHETHER SHE'S RUNNING YET, BUT ME THINKS SHE DOTH NOT MAKE UP HER MIND YET TOO MUCH. LET'S JUST LOOK AT THE FACTS. ONE, SHE'S ON A NATIONAL BOOK TOUR PUSHING HER MEMOIR "HARD CHOICES." TWO, SHE'S EXTREMELY QUALIFIED. THREE, LET'S FORGET ABOUT NUMBER TWO AND JUST FOCUS ON THE BOOK THING. WHICH, BY THE WAY, FOR THE RECORD I DON'T GET. SURE, IT'S BEEN ON THE "NEW YORK TIMES" BESTSELLER LIST FOR SEVEN WEEKS AND HAS SOLD MORE THAN 500,000 COPIES WORLDWIDE BUT I RECENTLY PICKED UP THE AUDIO BOOK. I LIKE TO LISTEN TO IT WHEN I'M ON THE TREADMILL AT THE GYM RAGER-SIZING. HERE'S THE COLBERT REVIEW. HERE'S MY REVIEW. THIS BOOK IS 656 PAGES OF SHAMELESS NAME DROPPING. JIM?
TANZANIAN PRIME MINISTER MIZENGO PINDA AND I DO SOME PLANTING AT A WOMEN'S COOPERATIVE IN MLANDIZI.
Stephen:  THUD. DID YOU CATCH THAT, TMZ? SHE JUST HAPPENED TO BE HANGING OUT WITH MIZENGO IN MLANDIZI. NOT IMPRESSED. SO SHE'S TIGHT WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF TANZANIA. I HAPPEN TO BE E-MAIL PEN PALS WITH THE PRINCE OF NIGERIA, OKAY? THAT REMINDS ME I SHOULD REALLY-- I SHOULD WRITE THAT GUY BACK. SHIWRITE THAT GUY.   ( APPLAUSE ) GOTTA WRITE HIM. HE OWES ME A TON OF MONEY. AND THERE'S MORE.
THE FIRST TIME I MET THE BURMESE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER AUNG SAN SUU KYI IN 2011, WE WERE BOTH WEARING WHITE.
Stephen:  REALLY? WEARING WHITE AFTER LABOR DAY? OBVIOUSLY, HER NOBEL PRIZE WASN'T IN FASHION. AGAIN, JIM.
GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL HAS A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.
Stephen:  YOU HEARD IT, FOLKS. HILLARY CLINTON THINKS GERMAN CHANCELLORS ARE A LAUGH RIOT. HEIL HILARITY.
HERE, BONO SITS WITH ME AT THE PIANO.
Stephen:  BIG DEAL! BONO SITS WITH EVERYBODY AT THE PIAPO. CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE SITTING WITH DAVID BOWIE AT A DIDGERIDOO. I JUST DON'T BUY ANY OF THIS. THERE IS NO WAY ON EARTH  ONE WOMAN CAN BE IN SO MANY PLACES AT ONCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "HILLARY")
Stephen:  DON'T YOU DARE! DON'T YOU DARE! YOU WERE CHANTING MY NAME FOUR MINUTES AGO, YOU TWO-TIMERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HILLARY CLINTON.
NOW WHO'S A NAME DROPPER, STEPHEN?
Stephen:  OH, REALLY? NAME DROPPER? THAT'S NOT WHAT MY GOOD FRIEND TOM HANKS CALLS ME. WHEN WE'RE HANGING OUT AT GEORGE CLOONEY'S PLACE.
OH, I LOVE GEORGE. I WISH HE COULD HAVE JOINED US WHEN I HAD LUNCH WITH MERYL STREEP AND ECUADORIAN PRESIDENT RAFAEL CORREA.
OH, RAFI. HE IS SUCH A CUT-UP, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE GO CAMPING WITH OPRAH. ( LAUGHTER ).
OH?
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?
NO, "O" IS JUST WHAT ALL HER REAL FRIENDS CALL OPRAH.
Stephen: I KNOW PAUL MCCARTNEY
I NEGOTIATED WITH HAMID KARZAI.
Stephen:  I SHARED AN OFFICE WITH STEVE CARELL. ( LAUGHTER ).
I HELD HIGH-LEVEL TALKS WITH CHINESE STATE COUNSELOR  DAI BINGGUO
Stephen:  WELL, NOW YOU'RE JUST MAKING WORDS UP. I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW, MADAM, I ONCE DID AN ENTIRE SHOW WITH PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.
OH! ( APPLAUSE ) I HATE TO BREAK THIS TO YOU, STEPHEN, BUT I'VE MET HIM, TOO.
Stephen:  GOSH, YOU KNOW EVERYONE! WHAT KIND OF LOSER DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO NOT BE INCLUDED IN YOUR BOOK?
WELL, YOU'RE NOT IN IT, STEPHEN?
Stephen:  OH, AREN'T I? YOU EVER NOTICE HOW PRESIDENT OF TURKMENISTAN GURBANGULY BERD-MUHA-MEADOW ARE NEVER IN THE SAME ROOM AT THE SAME TIME.
NO!
Stephen:  OH, YES.
Stephen:  AND, MADAM, IT IS NOT JUST YOUR NAME DROPPING I CALL INTO QUESTION. I QUESTION YOUR TITLE. IT'S CALLED "HARD CHOICES." BUT THERE AREN'T ANY REAL HARD CHOICES IN HERE.
WHAT ABOUT NEGOTIATING FRAGILE ALLIANCES AND TREATIES.
Stephen:  OH, I'M TALKING ABOUT REAL HARD CHOICES-- ETERNAL QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER FIGHT ONE HORSE-SIZED DUCK OR 100 DUCK-SIZED HORSES? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WELL --
Stephen:  BOOM!
NOW, I ADMIT THAT IS A VALID QUESTION. HERE'S WHAT I'D DO. FIRST, I'D TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND BETWEEN DUCKS AND HORSES. FOR INSTANCE, THEY BOTH GREW UP ON OLD McDONALD'S FARM. THEN, I'D ESTABLISH A TIMETABLE TO ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL HORSE-DUCK DIALOGUE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, STEPHEN, I'M CONVINCED-- WITH PATIENCE AND A STRONG COMMITMENT FROM OUR ALLIES, THE PIGS AND THE GEESE, WE'D HAVE PEACE-PEACE HERE, PEACE-PEACE, THERE, HERE A PEACE, THERE A PEACE, EVERYWHERE A PEACE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  EI-E-I-OH, YOU'RE GOOD!
AND NOW, STEPHEN, I'VE GOT A HARD CHOICE FOR YOU.
Stephen:  BRING IT, H.R.C.
OH, IT WILL BE BROUGHT. YOUR CHOICE. PROMOTE MY BOOK OR I WON'T APPEAR ON YOUR SHOW.
Stephen:  BUT YOU HAVE ALREADY APPEARED ON MY SHOW. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  NO! NO! >>I LEARNED THAT FROM GEORGE LUCAS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  I MET HIM. HE'S A FRIEND. WELL, NO ONE WILL KNOW I GOT HILLARY CLINTON ON MY SHOW. FINE! FINE! BUY "HARD CHOICES," AVAILABLE IN BOOKSTORES EVERYWHERE THERE ARE STILL BOOKSTORES. ON OR OUR WEB SITE DOWN HERE, OKAY?
OKAY.
Stephen:  OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN. WAS THAT SUCH A HARD CHOICE TO MAKE? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  YES, IT WAS. HILLARY CLINTON, EVERYBODY. "HARD CHOICES." MADAM SECRETARY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU!
Stephen:  HILLARY CLINTON, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
