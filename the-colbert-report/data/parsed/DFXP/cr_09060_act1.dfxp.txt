[EAGLE CAW]
Stephen: TONIGHT, A RIFT IN  THE GOP: SOME DENY GLOBAL  WARMING, OTHERS DENY CLIMATE  CHANGE. [LAUGHTER] THEN, HOLLYWOOD TAKES ON GUN  SAFETY. AND YET THEY IGNORE HOW MANY  YOUNGLINGS ARE CUT DOWN BY LIGHT  SABERS. [LAUGHTER] AND MY GUEST, ROGER HODGE, IS  EDITOR OF THE OXFORD AMERICAN  MAGAZINE, WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED THE "NEW YORKER OF THE SOUTH."  THE DOGS IN THEIR CARTOONS DON'T  GO TO PSYCHIATRISTS, THEY GO TO SHOOTING RANGES. [LAUGHTER] TED NUGENT WILL ATTEND THE STATE  OF THE UNION TONIGHT. OR AS DEER CALL IT, THE GREATEST  NIGHT OF THEIR LIVES. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] COME ON! [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. , LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WELCOME TO THE BROADCAST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LOVE  AND SUPPORT. YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THIS SHOW  WITHOUT YOU. THIS SHOW IS FOR YOU. THIS SHOW IS TO LOOK OUT FOR  WHAT IS COMING IN YOUR LIFE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND, FOLKS, TONIGHT I GOT YOUR  BACK, FOLKS. AS YOU KNOW, TONIGHT TONIGHT  BARACK-HUSSEIN OBAMA GETS TO  GIVE HIS ANNUAL "LOOK AT ME, I'M THE PRESIDENT" SPEECH. LOP-A-DOOPA DOO! LOP-A-DOOPA DOO! [LAUGHTER] ALL THIS STUFF? IT'S NOT EVEN IN THE  CONSTITUTION. [LAUGHTER] OBAMA SHOULDN'T EVEN BE UP  THERE GIVINGING THE SPEECH. 2012 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE  GOP'S YEAR: WITH THE ECONOMY IN  SHAMBLES, THEY THOUGHT THE RACE WAS THEIRS TO LOSE. AND THEY WERE RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] AND IT'S NOT JUST THE  PRESIDENCY. THE REPUBLICANS ALSO LOST SEATS  IN THE SENATE. LOST THE POPULAR VOTE IN THE  HOUSE. AND BRIEFLY LOST PAUL RYAN IN  THE MALL. [LAUGHTER] HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HOLD ON TO  HIS MOTHER'S HAND! [LAUGHTER] THEY FOUND HIM BUSTING A UNION  AT THE BUILD-A-BEAR WORKSHOP. [LAUGHTER] BUT FOLKS, THE RNC, THE  REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE,  IS DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
THE RNC IS DOING A MAJOR  AUTOPSY ON 2012.
THE RNC IS COMING UP WITH  SOME TYPE OF AUTOPSY OF THE LAST  ELECTION.
YOU'VE GOT TO DO A FULL  AUTOPSY.
Stephen: YES, A FULL AUTOPSY. WHICH IS ALSO THE REPUBLICAN  ALTERNATIVE TO OBAMACARE. [LAUGHTER] TO PLOT THEIR PATH BACK TO  POWER, THE GOP RECENTLY HELD A  THREE-DAY CONFERENCE IN WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA, WHICH IS  THE PERFECT LOCATION, BECAUSE  THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM ALSO RE-ENACTS THE 18TH CENTURY. [LAUGHTER] THEY SAY THEY WENT THERE FOR A  LITTLE SELF-REFLECTION EXACTLY  WHAT MEN INSPIRED BY AYN RAND NEED-- MORE TIME THINKING ABOUT  THEMSELVES. [LAUGHTER] THEY ALSO REACHED OUT TO VOTERS,  WITH A WEB-SURVEY ASKING HOW  THEY CAN IMPROVE THEIR  MESSAGING. AND A COMPUTERIZED WEB SURVEY IS  THE PERFECT WAY TO HEAR FROM  REPUBLICANS' CORE CONSTITUENCY OF THE EXTREMELY OLD. LATCH LAUGH  THE NUMBER ONE SUGGESTION WAS,  "HELLO? HELLO? HOW DOES THIS  THING MAKE TOAST?" [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND AFTER THAT, THE GOP CRUNCHED  THE NUMBERS AND FIGURED OUT WHAT  THEY NEED TO CHANGE ABOUT THEIR VIEWS TOWARD WOMEN, IMMIGRATION,  AND TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH. AND THE ANSWER WAS-- I HAVE IT  "NOTHING."  IT'S A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER. THERE'S NOTHING ON HERE YOU SEE. ACCORDING TO RNC CHAIR REINCE  PRIEBUS-- FUN FACT, HIS NAME IS  AN ANAGRAM FOR PENIS RICE-A-RONI-- [LAUGHTER] THE GOP DOESN'T NEED TO CHANGE  ON THE ISSUES, THEY JUST NEED TO  BE A PARTY THAT SMILES. [LAUGHTER] YES, THEY JUST NEED TO SMILE. PRESENT THE SAME CORE MESSAGE  BUT IN A MORE PLEASANT MANNER. I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS WITH  ONE OF THEIR MISUNDERSTOOD  TALKING POINTS FROM THE LAST  ELECTION. [LAUGHTER] "IF IT'S A LEGITIMATE RAPE, THE  FEMALE BODY HAS WAYS TO TRY TO  SHUT THAT WHOLE THING DOWN." [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO, REPUBLICANS HAVE GOT 2014 IN  THE BAG. OR THEY WOULD, IF NOT FOR  POLITICAL STRATEGIST AND  UNLANCED BOIL KARL ROVE. [LAUGHTER] YOU SEE, INSTEAD OF JOINING HIS  FELLOW REPUBLICANS IN LEARNING  NOTHING FROM THE LAST ELECTION, KARL HAS TURNED ON THEM.
KARL ROVE LAUNCHING AN EFFORT  CALLED THE CONSERVATIVE VICTORY  PROJECT-- TO KEEP LESS-ELECTABLE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS FROM  WINNING PRIMARIES.
ROVE ANNOUNCED HIS NEW SUPER  PAC AIMED AT CRUSHING TEA PARTY  REPUBLICANS.
OUR JOB IS TO WIN RACES BY  STOPPING THE PRACTICE OF GIVING  AWAY SOME OF THE SEATS LIKE WE DID IN MISSOURI AND INDIANA THIS  PAST YEAR.
Stephen: KARL'S BOGUS CLAIM  IS THAT TEA PARTIERS COST  REPUBLICANS WINNABLE RACES BY BACKING POLARIZING CANDIDATES,  LIKE TODD "LEGITIMATE RAPE"  AKIN, AND RICHARD "SOMEHOW EVEN WORSE ON RAPE" MOURDOCK. [LAUGHTER] MEANWHILE, THE MANATEE WITH THE  PLAN-ATEE WANTS THE PARTY TO GET  BEHIND THE KIND OF MAINSTREAM, ELECTABLE REPUBLICANS HE'S  BACKED LIKE NEAR-WINNER CONNIE  MACK,  STRONG RUNNER-UP LINDA MCMAHON, SO-CLOSE-BUT-DIDN'T-GET-IT  GEORGE ALLEN, [LAUGHTER] GOT-HIS-FINE-WHITE-ASS-HANDED-TO  -HIM SCOTT BROWN, AND OF COURSE  THAT GUY. [LAUGHTER] WHAT'S HIS NAME? I JUST AH --  BLAKE LIVELY!? I'M NOT -- [LAUGHTER] ROVE'S ALREADY GOT THE KNIVES  OUT FOR TWO TEA PARTY SENATE  HOPEFULS:  IOWA CONGRESSMAN AND ALLEGED CORN-PACKER, STEVE KING, [LAUGHTER] AND GEORGIA CONGRESSMAN PAUL  BROUN, WHO, DESPITE BEING A  MEDICAL DOCTOR, SAID THIS:
GOD'S WORD IS TRUE. I'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT. ALL THAT STUFF I WAS TAUGHT  ABOUT EVOLUTION, EMBRYOLOGY, BIG  BANG THEORY, ALL THAT IS LIES STRAIGHT FROM THE PIT OF HELL. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: AND PAUL BROUN KNOWS  PITS OF HELL BECAUSE THAT IS  EVIDENTLY WHERE HE'S SPEAKING  FROM. [LAUGHTER] WELL, THE TEA PARTY ISN'T GOING  TO TAKE KARL'S NEW  STAB-YOU-IN-THE-BACK SUPERPAC LYING DOWN. TEA PARTY ACTIVIST ERICK  ERICKSON SAYS,  "I DARE SAY ANY CANDIDATE WHO  GETS THIS GROUP'S SUPPORT SHOULD BE TARGETED FOR DESTRUCTION BY  THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT."  THAT'S RIGHT, KARL. YOU CROSS THE TEA PARTY AND YOU  COULD END UP LIKE THE LAST  CANDIDATE THEY TARGETED FOR DESTRUCTION BARACK OBAMA. [LAUGHTER] HMM. THINK ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] CLEARLY --  CLEARLY, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS  TEARING ITSELF IN HALF. I GUESS NOBODY REMEMBERS  THIS GUY, RONALD REAGAN, THE  WHITE MARCO RUBIO. [LAUGHTER] HE HAD A LITTLE SOMETHING CALLED  "THE ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT."  "THOU SHALT NOT SPEAK ILL OF ANY FELLOW REPUBLICAN."  THAT'S ALL OVER NOW AND I COULD  MEAN ONLY ONE THING.
CIVIL WAR.
THE PRESIDENT OF CITIZENS  UNITED DECLARED THE CIVIL WAR  HAS BEGUN.
IT'S FULL-ON GOP WARFARE. IT'S GOP CIVIL WAR.
Stephen: YES, GOP CIVIL WAR. OF COURSE, THE FIRST THING  THEY'LL HAVE TO FIGHT OVER IS  WHICH SIDE GETS THE CONFEDERATE  FLAG. [LAUGHTER] SO, AS A CONSERVATIVE, I GUESS I  HAVE TO CHOOSE SIDES. KARL AND I HAVE HAD SOME GOOD  TIMES, WE BURIED THAT HOOKER. [LAUGHTER] BUT DEEP DOWN, MY HEART IS WITH  THE TEA PARTY. WELL, MAYBE NOT MY HEART. WHAT ORGAN PRODUCES BILE. GALL BLADDER, I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW. I BELIEVE THAT REPUBLICANS CAN  NOT WUSS OUT HERE. THEY NEED TO CHARGE AHEAD AND  TAKE EVEN MORE CONSERVATIVE  POSITIONS. FORGET EMBRACING LATINOS, WE  NEED A PROGRAM TO SHOOT THEM  INTO SPACE. [LAUGHTER] LET'S GIVE THEM A PATHWAY TO LOW  ORBIT. GAYS SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO  MARRY, OR VOTE. I FOR ONE DON'T WANT SLOPPY  SECONDS ON THEIR LEVER-YANKING. AND I BELIEVE ALL WOMEN SHOULD  HAVE MANDATORY TRANSVAGINAL  ULTRASOUNDS BEFORE THEY CAN GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE. [LAUGHTER] HEY, NOBODY'S HAPPY WITH THEIR  PICTURE ANYWAY. NOW ARE THESE EXTREME POSITIONS? MAYBE. CAN WE REALLY WIN THE ELECTION  BY GIVING THE VOTERS MORE OF  WHAT THEY DIDN'T WANT LAST TIME? NO. UNLESS WE SMILE WHEN WE SAY IT! [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
