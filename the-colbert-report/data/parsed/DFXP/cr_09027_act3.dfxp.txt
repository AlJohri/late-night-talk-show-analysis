WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ABC'S  SENIOR WHITE HOUSE  CORRESPONDENT AND THE AUTHOR  OF THE OUTPOST, AN UNTOLD STORY OF AMERICAN VALOR. SO HOW DID HE HEAR ABOUT IT? PLEASE WELCOME JAKE TAPPER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  JAKE, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,  THANKS FOR COMING BACK. ALL RIGHT, JAKE, WE'RE GOING  GET TO THE BOOK IN JUST A  SECOND HERE BUT FIRST,  YOU'RE A NEWSMAN, YOU'RE LIKE THE PREMIER WHITE HOUSE  CORRESPONDENT OF NETWORK TV. RIGHT NOW.
OKAY.
Stephen: WHITE HOUSE,  PEOPLE THINK TAPPER. WHAT OTHER STORIES, NOW THAT  THE ELECTION IS OVER, WHERE  HAS THE NEWS MOVED TO RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I DID ABOUT TWO  MINUTES ON THE FACT THAT  THEY ARE NOT CHARGING THEIR CELL PHONES ON HOMELAND  TONIGHT.
THAT WAS A GOOD POINT,  GOOD POINT.
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU. THE PEABODY PEOPLE ARE  WATCHING I'M READY TO  SUBMIT. WHAT'S EVERYBODY TALKING  ABOUT?
THE FISCAL CLIFF.
Stephen: FISCAL CLIFF,  YEAH.
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF  SPENDING CUTS AND TAX  INCREASES THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THE BALL DROPS  ON NEW YEAR'S EVE UNLESS  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND CONGRESS COME TO SOME SORT OF  COMPROMISE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT SO,  WE'RE ALL DOOMED.
IT'S LIKE THE MOVIE THAW  YOU HAVE TO EITHER CUT OFF  YOUR ARM OR DIE. SO THEY WILL COME-- THEY  WILL CUT OFF THEIR ARM.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW, DO  YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF  RATINGS THE NEWS COULD GET IF THEY COULD GET  POLITICIANS TO CUT OFF THEIR  ARMS ON CAMERA? OKAY. --   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AS I SAID SENIOR  WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT  FOR ABC NEWS. THE ONLY NEWS ANYBODY  WATCHES ANY MORE.
I THINK THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: AND YOU HAVE GOT  EYE NEW BOOK HERE CALLED THE  OUTPOST, AN UNTOLD STORY OF AMERICAN VALOR. THIS IS ABOUT THE WAR IN  AFGHANISTAN.
IT'S ABOUT ONE COMBAT  OUTPOST IN AFGHANISTAN, 14  MILES FROM THE PAKISTAN BORDER, BUILT AT THE BOTTOM  OF THREE VERY STEEP  MOUNTAINS, BUILT IN 2006. AND OVERRUN IN 2009 BY THE  TALIBAN.
Stephen: LET'S PUT A  PICTURE OF THIS SPACE RIGHT  HERE.
THAT'S IT.
Stephen: THE SPACE IS AT  THE BOTTOM NOT UP HERE WHERE  THIS GUY IS STANDING SAFELY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY. YOU KNOW WHERE WOULD BE A  GOOD PLACE TO ATTACK THAT  BASE FROM.
RIGHT THERE.
Stephen: EVERYWHERE. OKAY, WE'LL GET TO WHY IT IS  THAT WAY IN JUST A MOMENT.
OKAY.
Stephen: WHAT WERE THESE  GUYS DOING IN THIS VALLEY? WHAT WAS THEIR PURPOSE TO BE  AT COMMAND OPERATING POST.
COMBAT OUTPOST KEATING. THEY ORIGINALLY WERE PUT  THERE TO STOP THE FLOW OF  WEAPONS FROM PAKISTAN INTO  AFGHANISTAN, TO TRY TO WIN OVER THE LOCALS. BUT DESPITE SOME SUCCESSES  IN THE THREE AND A HALF  YEARS OF THE CAMP, BY THE  END IT ITS ONLY PURPOSE REALLY WAS ITS OWN  SELF-DEFENSE. ONE LIEUTENANT COLONEL WHO  WAS TRYING VALIANTLY TO  CLOSE IT DOWN DESCRIBED IT  AS A SELF-LICKING ICE CREAM  CONE. ITS ONLY PURPOSE WAS TO  EXIST UNTO ITSELF.
Stephen: SO IT WAS THERE  TO DEFEND ITSELF THAT IT WAS  THERE.
YEAH, AND ULTIMATELY  AFTER THE ATTACK AND EIGHT  U.S. TROOPS WERE KILLED IN THIS ATTACK THEY FACED, IT  WAS 53 U.S. TROOPS IN THAT  CAMP FACE BEING 400 TALIBAN SURROUNDING THEM. THEY FOUGHT VALIANTLY, THE  AMERICANS AND IT WAS A  BLOODY DAY BUT ULTIMATELY  THEY BEAT THEM BACK. ULTIMATELY THE ARMY  INVESTIGATED AND SAID THERE  WAS NO STRATEGIC PURPOSE FOR  THIS CAMP.
Stephen: NOW WHY WAS IT  AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY?
BECAUSE WELL, THERE ARE A  LOT OF REASONS. BUT TWO OF THE BIGGEST ONES  ARE ONES SO THEY COULD BOND  WITH THE LOCAL POP LAS  BECAUSE THE DISTRICT CENTER WAS DOWN THE ROAD AND TWO  BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO  RESUPPLYMENT AND AT 2 O 006,  DURING 2006 MOST OF THE HELICOPTERS WERE IN IRAQ. AND SO IN ORDER TO SET UP A  CAMP THERE IT NEEDED TO BE  BY A ROAD SO THEY COULD  RESUPPLY THE CAMP. AND THEY COULDN'T DO IT BY  HELICOPTER BECAUSE THE WAR  AT THAT POINT WAS UNDER  MANNED AND DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH ASSETS. AMERICA HAS PAID ATTENTION  TO AFGHANISTAN AND THEN  FORGOTTEN THE WAR AND THEN  PAID ATTENTION TO AFGHANISTAN AND THEN  FORGOTTEN THE WAR AGAIN. WHAT MADE YOU REMEMBER THE  WAR AS A JOURNALIST? WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO GO OVER  THERE.
TWO THINGS. ONE IS I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL  ROOM WITH MY NEWLY SON BORN  JACK ON OCTOBER 3rd. AND IN NEWS REPORT CAME OUT  OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE  SAYING THAT THIS CAMP HAD  BEEN OVERRUN, A CAMP I HAD NEVER HEARD OF. BUT THE COVERAGE WAS ALL WHY  WOULD ANYBODY PUT A CAMP  THERE, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND I WANTED TO FIND  OUT THAT MYSTERY IT DIDN'T  MAKE ANY SENSE. AND NO ONE EVER EXPLAINED IT  SO I STARTED RESEARCHING AND  ASKING AND FIND OUT WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE AT THAT PLACE  WITH ALL THE TALIBAN  FIGHTERS. AND IT EVENTUALLY BECAME A  BOOK. AND THE OTHER REASON IS I  HAD BEEN COVERING THE WAR  FROM THE COMFORT OF THE  NORTH LAWN OF THE WHITE  HOUSE. AND I DIDN'T KNOW AS MUCH AS  I NEEDED TO KNOW ABOUT THE  WAR. AND WE WERE BATTING AROUND  TROOP NUMBERS WHEN THEY WERE  TALKING ABOUT THE SURGE, 10,000, 40,000, SUDDENLY  WHEN ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 8  DEAD AMERICANS, 8 SONS THAT I WAS LEARNING ABOUT HAD  BEEN TAKEN FROM THE AS I WAS  HOLDING MY NEW SON T BECAME A LOT MORE REAL. THE NUMBER 8 THAN 40,000. AND SO IT WAS FOR THAT  REASON THAT I STARTED  RESEARCHING THE BOOK.
Stephen: NOW IN THIS  LATEST POLITICAL CAMPAIGN  THAT WE ALL JUST WENT THREW AND THANK GOD IT'S OVER.
I AGREE.
Stephen: AT THIS  POINT-- AT THIS POINT--   (APPLAUSE)  AT THIS POINT I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHO WON. THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF TALK  ABOUT AFGHANISTAN.
NO.
Stephen: BESIDES THE FACT  THAT ROMNEY DIDN'T EVEN  MENTION IT IN IN HIS CONVENTION SPEECH. BOTH MEN IN THE DEBATE SAID  WE'RE GOING TO BE OUT OF  THERE BY 2014.
NOT COMPLETELY ACCURATE  BY THE WAY.
Stephen: OH, REALLY. HOW FAST WOULD YOU GET OUT?
I WAS HAPPY TO LEAVE. BUT WE'RE GOING TO WITHDRAW  THE COMBAT TROOPS BY 2014. BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE  SPECIAL FORCES TROOPS THERE  FOR A LONG TIME AND JUST  JUDGING BY WHAT I SAW IN TERMS OF-- .
Stephen: AREN'T SPECIAL  FORCES COMBAT TROOPS?
ONE WOULD THINK BUT NOT  TECHNICALLY. TECHNICALLY-- SSES  TECHNICALLY THEY'RE GOING TO  BE TEACHING ARTS AND CRAFTS? WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO BE BE  DOING, MACRAME.
THEY'LL BE DOING  COUNTERTERRORIST MISSIONS SO  IT WILL BE DIFFERENT, NOT COMBAT BUT COUNTERTERRORISM. THEY WILL GO AFTER THE  STRONGHOLDS OF INSURGENTS  THAT COULD POSE A THREAT  THEORETICALLY TEERT AFGHAN GOVERNMENT OR THE U.S..
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW IF  THOSE GUYS ARE WATCHING  HOMELAND BUT IF YOU ARE'S GOING AFTER TERRORIST YOU  NEED A WELL CHARGED CELL  PHONE. WELL, JAKE, THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE BOOK IS THE OUTPOST, THE  MAN IS JAKE TAPPER, THANK  YOU, JAKE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
