(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: RIGHT THERE! RIGHT DOWN THERE! WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") OH, YEAH, BEAUTIFUL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. ALL THE SATELLITES IN SPACE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, WE'VE GOT LOTS OF NEWS TO GET TO. WE'VE GOT TO DO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOLKS, LOTS OF NEWS TO GET TO BUT FIRST I HAVE GOT TO SEND A "THE COLBERT REPORT" SHOUTOUT -- (IMAGE YELLS) -- TO MY AFRICAN AMERICAN VIEWER OR VIEWERS.  (LAUGHTER)  IT VARIES NIGHT TO NIGHT. BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN IT IS  FEBRUARY, FOLKS-- WHICH, OF COURSE, IS BLACK HISTORY MONTH-- BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT IT'S ALSO CHILDREN'S DENTAL HEALTH MONTH? (LAUGHTER) THAT MEANS IT'S AN IMPORTANT MONTH FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS, CHILDREN WITH TEETH, BUT ESPECIALLY AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN WITH TEETH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE POINT IS, KIDS, GREAT AFRICAN AMERICAN LEADERS LIKE ROSA PARKS AND MARTIN LUTHER KING WANT YOU TO FLOSS. (LAUGHTER) OKAY? THAT'S WHAT THEY FOUGHT FOR. AND THANKS TO THEIR SACRIFICE, YOU CAN FLOSS ON ANY SEAT IN THE BUS YOU CHOOSE. BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WORSE THAN RACISM AND THAT'S RACISM WITH GINGIVITIS. (LAUGHTER) YET ANOTHER CAMERA, YET ANOTHER EMOTIONAL STATE. NATION, MY BLOOD IS BOILING. AND IT BETTER STOP SOON BECAUSE I LIKE MY VEINS AL DENTE. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, BASELESS ATTACKS CONTINUE TO BE LEVIED AGAINST CHRIS CHRISTIE, MY PERSONAL FRIEND THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING ONE DAY. (LAUGHTER) THE GOVERNOR PUT THE BRIDGE GATE NONSCANDAL TO BED WEEKS AGO. WELL, GUESS WHAT? SOMEBODY WOKE IT UP, FOLKS, AND IT'S CRANKY AS HELL.
EXPLOSIVE NEW ALLEGATIONS ABOUT CHRIS CHRISTIE.
BOMBSHELL NEW ALLEGATIONS.
A FORMER NEW JERSEY TRANSPORTATION OFFICIAL WHO ONCE WORKED FOR CHRIS CHRISTIE IS MAKING NEW CLAIMS TONIGHT SUGGESTING THE GOVERNOR LIED ABOUT WHEN HE KNEW OF THE G.W. BRIDGE LANE CLOSURE.
THE LAWYER FOR DAVID WILDSTEIN WRITES: "EVIDENCE EXISTS TYING MR. CHRISTIE TO HAVING KNOWLEDGE OF THE LANE CLOSURES.".
Stephen: "EVIDENCE EXISTS." OOH! (LAUGHTER) IT EXISTS! AND SHOULD EVIDENCE EVER BE "PRESENTED" SHAKING IN MY BOOTS WOULD "OCCUR." (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS IS JUST THE GOVERNOR'S WORD AGAINST DAVID WILDSTEIN'S AND, YES, THEY WERE HIGH SCHOOL CLASSMATES AND, YES, CHRISTIE CREATED A JOB AT THE PORT AUTHORITY TO APPOINT WILDSTEIN TO, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THEY WERE CLOSE, RIGHT?
DAVID AND I WERE NOT FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL. WE WERE NOT EVEN ACQUAINTANCES IN HIGH SCHOOL. I WAS THE CLASS PRESIDENT AND ATHLETE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAVID WAS DOING DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. (LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE REACTS) YES. YES. CHRISTIE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WILDSTEIN WAS DOING AT THAT TIME. I MEAN, IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYONE'S HEAD HE WAS HOLDING DOWN IN THE TOILET! (LAUGHTER) BUT, FOLKS, IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW BECAUSE THIS PAST WEEKEND THE GOVERNOR DESTROYED WILDSTEIN'S REPUTATION BY RELEASING A MEMO FILLED WITH FIVE DAMNING REVELATIONS. DAVID WILDSTEIN WILL DO AND SAY ANYTHING TO SAVE DAVID WILDSTEIN. OUCH. HE HAD A CONTROVERSIAL TENURE AS MAYOR OF LIVINGSTON. OOH! HE WAS AN ANONYMOUS BLOGGER. WOW! FOLKS, THAT IS A DAMNING LIST. AND IT DOESN'T EVEN MENTION THE TROUBLING RUMORS THAT WILDSTEIN IS A KNOWN ASSOCIATE OF SCANDAL-PLAGUED GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) BUT, FOLKS, ALL OF THAT -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL OF THIS -- ALL OF THIS JUST PALES WHEN COMPARED TO THE DARKEST REVELATION THAT WILDSTEIN WAS PUBLICLY ACCUSED BY HIS HIGH SCHOOL SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER OF DECEPTIVE BEHAVIOR! (AUDIENCE REACTS) OH, YEAH. FOLKS, I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT THAT COULD MEAN. DID HE IMPROPERLY FOOTNOTE A TERM PAPER? DID HE FORGE HIS MOM'S SIGNATURE FOR A FIELD TRIP TO COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG? DID HE COVER HIS CROTCH WITH A NOTEBOOK WHILE GIVING AN ORAL REPORT UPON HEARING THE WORDS "ORAL REPORT"? AND, AGAIN, AGAIN, FOLKS, THESE ACCUSATIONS ARE COMING FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL: A SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER! NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, DAVID WILDSTEIN'S SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT BECAUSE HE IS DECEASED. (AUDIENCE REACTS) WAS IT...MURDER? (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) NO, IT WAS NATURAL CAUSES. (LAUGHTER) BUT I WAS ABLE TO CONTACT ONE PERSON WHO KNOWS BOTH CHRISTIE AND WILDSTEIN. PLEASE WELCOME THEIR FIRST GRADE TEACHER MRS. LUDEMEYER. MRS. LUDEMEYER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW MRS. LUDEMEYER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO SPEAK WITH ME TODAY. I HEAR YOU HAVE SOME DAMAGING REVELATIONS ABOUT WHAT DAVID WILDSTEIN WAS LIKE AS A FIRST GRADER.
YES, STEPHEN. HE WAS AN UNTRUSTWORTHY LITTLE RUFFIAN. ONE TIME HE SAID HE NEEDED TO TINKLE BUT ONCE HE WAS IN THE BATHROOM HE JUST PLAYED WITH THE SOAP DISPENSER.
Stephen: OKAY, DID YOU ALSO TEACH CHRIS CHRISTIE?
CHRISTOPHER? (LAUGHS) OH, HE WAS A JOY! KIDS LIKE CHRISSY ARE WHY I TEACH! DEFINITELY PRESIDENTIAL MATERIAL. A BORN LEADER WITH EXECUTIVE EXPERIENCE. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) MRS. LUDEMEYER, YOU'RE READING OFF OF NOTE CARDS. DID CHRIS CHRISTIE'S PEOPLE GET TO YOU?
YES. HE CLOSED OFF TWO LANES OF THE LUNCH LINE. (LAUGHTER) I WOULDN'T ENDORSE HIM AND A WEEK LATER THE CLASS GOLDFISH TURNED UP DEAD! (AUDIENCE REACTS) I COULD BE NEXT!
Stephen: YOU STAY STRONG, MRS. LUDEMEYER.
CAN I STAY HERE TONIGHT?
Stephen: OF COURSE YOU CAN! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
