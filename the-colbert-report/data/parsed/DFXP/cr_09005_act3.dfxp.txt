Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMER  ASTRONAUT WHOSE NEW  CHILDREN'S BOOK IS TITLED  MOUSETRONAUT. I THINK IS ABOUT A BEFORE  WHO BECOMES A FIREMAN. PLEASE WELCOME MARK KELLY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HEY, MARK, GOOD TO SEE YOU  AGAIN. SIT DOWN.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT. A WE ARE FRIEND IT,  WELL-KNOWN TO MY VIEWERS. WERE A NAVY CAPTAIN.
YES.
Stephen: YOU COMMANDED  THE FINAL MISSION OF THE  SPATIALCIOUS ELLEN DEFER. YOU FLEW 39 COMBAT MISSIONS,  THE FIRST IRAQ WAR. YOU'RE ALSO THE HUSBAND OF  GABBIE GIFFORDS. HOW IS SHE DOING?
SHE IS DOING GREAT. WE RECENTLY MOVED BACK TO  TUCSON, ARIZONA SO SHE'S  VERY HAPPY TO GET BACK TO  HER HOMETOWN.
Stephen: LOVED SEEING HER  AT DNC. AS A GUY WHO IS AN ASTRONAUT  WHO HAS FLOWN THE SHUTTLE  FOUR TIME ITS AND HAD 39  COMBAT MISSIONS, DID YOU EVER THINK YOU'D BE THE  SECOND MOST HEROIC PERSON IN  YOUR MARRIAGE?
NO. WELL, I ALWAYS KNEW SHE  WOULD BE THE MOST HEROIC. I MEAN SHE IS JUST SPECIAL,  SPECIAL PERSON.
Stephen: NOW WHEN YOU  WERE STILL FLYING AS BE  ASTRONAUT, GABBY WAS A CHAIR  OF THE SPACE ANDARY NAUGHT ECK SUBCOMMITTEE.
SHE WAS.
DID SHE EVER SAY YOU HAVE  TAKEN OUT THE GARBAGE YET  AND YOU SHOOT BACK LIKE,  HAVE YOU OKAYED OUR FUNDING  YET?
WELL, NO, I WOULD  ACTUALLY ASK HER FOR MORE  MONEY FOR NASA FREQUENTLY. BUT NO, SHE NEVER GAVE IT TO  US. BUT I DID ASK.
Stephen: THAT'S TOUGH. OKAY. NOW YOU AS I SAID YOU FLEW  THE LAST SHUTTLE MISSION. BUT ALSO SOMETHING MORE  IMPORTANT THAN THAT, ABOUT A  YEAR BEFORE THAT YOU TRAINED  ME HOW TO BE AN ASTRONAUT. WE GOT IN RIGHT THERE AS YOU  CAN SEE. WE GOT INTO THE COCKPIT OF  THE SHUTTLE AND I LANDED  THAT BAD BOY, DID I NOT.
YOU DID. I GOT TO TELL YOU.
DID I IMPRESS YOU.
YOU DID A FANTASTIC JOB. I WAS VERY SURPRISED. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SURPRISED THAT I  DID A GOOD JOB OR THAT  ANYONE WOULD BE THAT GOOD.
MAYBE IT WAS ANYBODY.
Stephen: ANYBODY WOULD  THAT BE GOOD. HERE'S MY BONE TO PICK WITH  YOU, SIR. I WAS LOOKING FOR A BACKUP  POSITION IF THIS JOB EVER  FALLS THROUGH AND THAT  ENTIRE OCCUPATION  DISAPPEARED ONE YEAR LATER.
IT DIDN'T DISAPPEAR.
Stephen: THERE IS NO  SHUTTLE PILOT ANY MORE.
WELL, THAT'S TRUE. THERE IS NO SPACE SHUTTLE  ANY MORE BUT WE ARE, NASA IS  LOOKING FOR NEW ASTRONAUTS. I THINK YOU SHOULD  RECONSIDER YOUR APPLICATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BUT LISTEN, I  HEAR YOUR CALL TO GREATNESS,  DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT  AREN'T WE JUST HITCHING RIRDS WITH THE RUSKIES RIGHT NOW.
WE ARE, IT IS UNFORTUNATE,  $50 MILLION A SEAT.
Stephen: $50 MILLION.
IT IS NOT A GOOD POSITION  TO BE IN BUT WE'VE GOT  REALLY SOME GOOD COMPANIES  OUT THERE, A COMPANY LIKE SPACE X JUST LAUNCHED  YESTERDAY.
Stephen: THEY'RE UP THERE  RIGHT NOW GOING AROUND.
HEADING TO THE SPACE  STATION, UNFORTUNATELY THERE  ARE NO PEOPLE ON BOARD BUT  THEY WILL GET THERE. I'M REALLY CONFIDENT, GIVE  THEM FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AND  WE'LL BE BACK IN THAT  BUSINESS.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE DEAL  SINCE YOU WERE THE LAST  SHUTTLE COMMANDER TO PULL  AWAY FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, WHAT DID YOU  TURN TO THE RUSSIANS SAND  SAY SUCK MY SPUTNIK, WHAT  DID YOU-- DID YOU DROP A BOTTLE OF TANG AND GO U.S. --
BOTTLE OF VODKA BZ.
Stephen: BOTTLE OF VODKA. OKAY. NOW YOU HAVE DONE ALL THESE  HEROIC THINGS BUT ITS MOST  HEROIC THING POSSIBLY IS YOU  HAVE ENTERED PUBLISHING. YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED  MOUSETRONAUT AND IT'S  ADORABLE. BUT IT'S ALSO BASED ON A  TRUE STORY, ISN'T IT?
IT IS.
Stephen: TELL THE PEOPLE  WHERE THE STORY CAME FROM.
ON MY FIRST SPACE SHUTTLE  FLIGHT WE WILL 18 MICE ON  BOARD.
Stephen: ON PURSE.
ON PURPOSE. THEY DIDN'T CLIMB UP THE  ROPE SO WE HAD 18 ON BOARD  AND 17 OF THEM REALLY DID  NOT LIKE THIS EXPERIENCE. THEY WERE LATCHED ON TO THE  INSIDE OF THE CAGE WITH  THEIR LITTLE MOUSE TOES AND  FINGERS. BUT ONE OF THEM SEEMED TO  REALLY GET IT. HE WOULD FLY OVER AND DRINK  HIS WATER AND FLY OVER AND  EAT HIS FOOD.
Stephen: REALLY.
OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD DO  A FLIP AND THAT'S WHAT THAT  BOOK IS BASED ON IS THAT  LITTLE GUY.
Stephen: DID YOU TAKE Z  YOU LEARN ANY LESSONS FROM  THE MOUSE. WHO WAS MORE COMFORTABLE IN  SPACE, YOU OR THAT MOUSE.
I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE  MOUSE. BUT I DID LEARN-- .
Stephen: REALLY, YOU WERE  IN CHARGE OF THE MOUSE.
THAT WAS ONE OF MY SMALL  JOBS.
Stephen: WOW.
I WAS THE PILOT/ANIMAL  HANDLER.
Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU  HOPING TO LEARN FROM THE  MICE IN SPACE IS THIS ONE OF  THE THINGS WHERE IT DOESN'T END WELL FOR THE MICE OR --
LET ME JUST SAY WHEN I  GOT OFF THE SPACE SHUTTLE HE  WAS DOING JUST FINE. HE WAS DOING OKAY. SO DIDON'T KNOW WHAT  HATCHED.
Stephen: HE WAS FINE WHEN  I LEFT THE PARTY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WHEN YOU WERE UP THERE, I  GOT A TREADMILL NEWSPAPER  SPACE. SHOW THE TREADMILL THERE. THIS IS THE COLBERT  TREADMILL. IT IS THE COMBINED  OPERATIONAL LOAD BEARING  EXTERNAL RESISTANCE  TREADMILL. OKAY. DID YOU EVER USE MY  TREADMILL WHEN YOU WERE UP  THERE.
NO, A YEAR AGO I THINK I  MAY HAVE BROKEN IT.
Stephen: SERIOUSLY.
MAYBE. NO I DON'T KNOW. I THINK IT'S PROBABLY BEEN  FIXED.
Stephen: SURE, SURE, I'M  SURE THE MOUSE IS FINE TOO. WELL, MARK KELLY, THANK YOU  SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. THE BOOK IS MOUSETRONAUT. GIVE YOUR KID SOMETHING TO  SHOOT FOR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
