Stephen: TONIGHT OBAMA'S LATEST ATTACK ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, YOU CAN NO LODGE PRESENCE FOR PREEXISTING NAUGHTINESS THEN CAN WE TRUST WHAT WE READ ON THE INTERNET. I'VE GOT ONE WEIRD TRICK THAT WILL HELP YOU FIND OUT.
AND GOING BEHIND THE SCENES AT FOX NEWS, I WONDER HOW MUCH PEANUT PUT TER TAKES TO MAKE FRESH BEAR LOOK LIKE HE'S TALKS.
THEY SAY HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD A LIE BEFORE THE TRUTH HAS A CHANCE TO GET ITS PANTS ON. WHY DOES THE TRUTH HAVE ITS PANTS OFF. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) . (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU, GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US. NATION,.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE, SIT DOWN. FOLKS, NATION, THE BIG NEWS CONTINUES TO BE THE SLOW MOTION TRAIN WRECK THAT IS THE ROLLOUT OF THE PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE LEGISLATION THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, OR AS MOST PEOPLE CARE IT BARAKOCARE. EVERYONE IS GETTING SCREWED BY THE WEB SITE BUT THE TRUE VICTIM OF THIS HEALTH CARE DISASTER ARE AMERICA'S MOST VULNERABLE, THE MEN. WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL CARE MEN ALWAYS GET THE SHORT END OF THE LONG END OF THE SCOPE. YOU SEE, FOLKS, UP UNTIL NOW HEALTH INSURANCE IN AMERICA HAS ALWAYS STRUCK A DELICATE BALANCE. WOMEN PAID HIGHER PREMIUMS THEN MEN AND IN RETURN MEN PAID LESS. (LAUGHTER) THE SYSTEM WORKED. BUT NOW FOLKS, ALL THAT'S CHANGING. OBAMACARE WILL HAVE MEN AND WOMEN PAYING THE SAME AMOUNT FOR HEALTH CARE BUT SINCE WOMEN LIVE LONGER, AND HAVE BABIES SHOULDN'T THEY PAY MORE.
UNDER THE NEW LAW THEY'RE INCLUDING ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. AND THOSE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS INCLUDE MATERNITY, PEDIATRIC, DENTAL AND VISION, CONTRACEPTIVE SERVICES AND FREE BIRTH-CONTROL PILLS NONE OF WHICH A YOUNG MAN NEEDS OR WANTS. (LAUGHTER) DID YOU CATCH THAT? UNDER OBAMACARE MEN WILL PAY THE SAME AMOUNT AS WOMEN AND YET WE STILL DON'T GET TO PASS A CAN'T HOPE WITH TOE NAILS THROUGH OUR GENITALS. BUSINESS HOST AND MAD AL TOUSSAE CIRCUMSTANCES WAX FIGURE JOHN STOSSEL REMINDED US WHY THE LADY ITS SHOULD PAY MORE.
YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE PEOPLE WHO USE THE SERVICES MORE, MORE.
WOMEN GO TO THE DOCTOR MUCH MORE OFTEN THAN MEN. MAYBE THEY'RE SMARTER OR MAYBE THEY'RE HYPOCHONDRIACS, THEY LIVE LONGER, WHO KNOWS.
Stephen: YEAH, LADY, LADIES, COME ON. LADIES, LADIES LOVE GOING TO THE DOCTOR. WHO KNOWS WHY. MAYBE THEY'RE PRETENDING THEY'RE EXTRAS ON "GREY'S ANATOMY". I DON'T KNOW. THEY'RE SUCKERS FOR THAT STUFF. AT FOX NEWS CHIEF UROLOGIST DR. DAVID SUMATI GIVES US A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE OF THE LADY'S DOCTOR ADDICTION.
THAT'S NOT-- SHE IS SEES HER DOCTOR, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WENT TO SEAT DOCTOR.
TWOIERS AGO.
EXACTLY.
AND YOU.
I HAVE HAD LYME DISEASE FOR THE LAST TEN DAYS.
SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS, SO YOU ARE BASICALLY PAYING FOR IT.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. WOMEN GET BITTEN BY AN INSECT, THEY GET LYME DISEASE AM A PAN GETS BITTEN BY AN INSECT, HE BECOMES A SUPERHERO. NOT FAIR. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOT FAIR. AND FOLKS IT'S NO WONDER THE BROWN HAIRED GUY WHO IS NOT STEVE DOOCY WON'T GO TO THE DOCTOR. HE HATES WEARING THAT CONE. FOLKS, HE'S NOT ALONE. THE FOX DOC EXPLAINED THE OBVIOUS REASON WHY ALL MEN, ALWAYS GO TO THE DOCTOR LESS.
WE ARE USING THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM MUCH LESS. YOU KNOW, ALSO, OUR BODY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. WE ONLY HAVE THE PROSTATE. WOMEN HAVE THE BREASTS, THE OVARY, THE UTTERUS THAT GET CHECKED.
YEAH, MEN ONLY HAVE THE PROSTATE. (LAUGHTER) MEANWHILE, WOMEN ARE LIKE THE MINES OF MORIA DOWN THERE YOU GOT THE TUBE, YOU GOT THE DO-DAD, YOU GOT THE CHICAGO BULL, YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO KIND OF SQUINT TO MAKE OUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON DOWN THERE. IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE MAGIC EYE POSTERS. THEY SAY THERE'S A LITTLE MAN IN A BOAT BUT I'VE NEVER FOUND IT. I TELL YOU WHAT, FELLAS, TELL YOU WHAT, AS LONG AS WE'RE FOOTING THE BILL FOR ALL THIS LADY MAINTENANCE I SAY WE DEMAND PAP SMEARS. OKAY? HEY, HEY! IF GYNECOLOGIST, NOT GAL-NICOLO GIST. I SAY WE FIND A PLACE TO STICK THAT SPECULUM. THEY'RE THE DOCTORS. NATION AS A DEEPLY RELIGE-- RELIGIOUS MAN I KNOW THE DEVIL TAKES MANY MORES BUT MOSTLY BARACK OBAMA. AND THERE IS YET ANOTHER SERIOUS SIDE EFFECT OF BARACKOCARE, LOSS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.
ONE KEY CONCERN IS THE HHS CONTRACEPTION PAN DATE WHICH WILL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO MAKE SURE EMPLOYEES HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE THAT PROVIDES COST FREE CONTRACEPTION.
OPPONENTS OF THE PAN DATE SAY IT'S GOING TO MAKE BUSINESS OWNERS VIOLATE THEIR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS BY FORCING THEM TO PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES THAT INCLUDES ALL TYPES OF BIRTH CONTROL.
Stephen: YUP, MANDATED BIRTH CONTROL. JUST THE FIRST STEP IN OBAMA'S PLAN TO-- PLAN TO GET THE WHOLE COUNTRY HOOKED ON THE PILL. I THINK THEY ARE SLIPPING INTO THE DRINKING WATER ALREADY BECAUSE I KNOW I HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME VERY LIGHT PERIODS AM I'M NOT SAYING NOTHING, BUT PRETTY LIGHT. NOW SOME PEOPLE, SOME PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING THEIR RIGHTS BUT SOME LEGAL PERSONS DIDN'T HAVE-- DON'T HAVE MOUTHS. THEY'RE CALLED CORPORATIONS. AND THEIR CRUSADE BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IN GOD WE TRUST. FOLKS, ONE OF THE VICTIMS OF MANDATED CONTRACEPTION IS HOBBY LOBBY WITH. OVER 500 RETAIL LOCATIONS THEY ARE THE NATION'S LARGEST CRAFT SUPPLY BUSINESS. NOW FOLKS, THE OWNERS, THE OWNERS OF HOBBY LOBBY, THE GREEN FAMILY, ARE DEVOUT CHRISTIANS WHO BELIEVE THAT LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION. AND COINCIDENTALLY THEIR BUSINESS, HOBBY LOBBY, ALSO BELIEVES LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION. AND WHILE, WHILE HOBBY LOBBY IS HAPPY TO SELL RICK RACK AND GLITTER GLUE ONE THING IS NOT FOR SALE. IT'S VALUE. SO HOBBY LOBBY'S LAWYERS HOBBY LOBBIES THE COURT FOR A RELIGIOUS  EXCEPTION-- EXEMPTION FOR MANDATED CONTRACEPTION ARGUING THE CORPORATION ITSELF IS ENTITLED TO FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION. OF COURSE RULINGS LIKE CITIZENS UNITED HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH. SO WHY NOT RELIGION. AND ALREADY A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT AGREED RULING CORPORATIONS CAN BE PERSONS, EXERCISING RELIGION. THAT'S RIGHT. A CORPORATION CAN HAVE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS--  (LAUGHTER) FOLKS-- THAT FEELS RIGHT, DOESN'T IT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YES. YES. THAT FEELS RIGHT TO EVERYBODY. BECAUSE CORPORATIONS STRUGGLE WITH THE SAME EXISTENTIAL QUESTIONS WE ALL DO. AND AMERICA WAS FOUNDED, THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON THE IDEALS OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY FOR ALL PEOPLE, BE THEY CHRISTIAN, JEWISH, BUDDHIST OR LIMITED LIABILITY FORMED UNDER SUBCHAPTER S OF THE UNITED STATES TAX CODE. THEREFORE-- THEREFORE THE CORPORATE PERSON KNOWN AS HOBBY LOBBY SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO PROVIDE CONTRACEPTION BECAUSE IT IS ACCEPTED JESUS INTO ITS HEARTS AND HAS BEEN SAVED. AND FOLKS-- THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER CORPORATIONS WHO PRACTICE RELIGION. I MEAN OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THERE IS QUAKER OATS, THERE IS CHRIST-LER. THERE IS CHURCH'S CHICKEN AND VIRGIN, WHICH OF COURSE WORSHIPS A BIZARRE GOAT HEADED GOD. SO I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE IT IS TIME WE ACKNOWLEDGED THE DEEP FAITH HELD BY ALL OF OUR CORPORATE CITIZEN THOSE MATTER WHAT FAITH THEY ARE. HINDUS BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION SO WHY SHOULD A HINDU CORPORATION BE FORCED TO FOLLOW WORKPLACE SAFETY LAWS. IF THERE'S AN ACCIDENT, THE WORKER WILL JUST COME BACK AS AN ANT. AND--  (LAUGHTER) REMEMBER, BUDDHISTS REJECT THE MATERIAL WORLD. WHY SHOULD A BUDDHIST CORPORATION BE FORCED TO PAY ANYONE MONEY. AND OUT OF RESPECT FOR THEIR DEEPLY HELD BELIEFS, WE ALLOW NATIVE AMERICANS TO LEGALLY DROP PEYOTE, THEREFORE WE SHOULD A LA COKE INDUSTRIES TO LEGALLY DROP ACID IN OUR RIVERS. NOW REMEMBER, REMEMBER, FOLKS, THE PURPOSE OF RELIGION IS TO ANSWER THE ULTIMATE QUESTION, ARE WE IN CONTROL OR IS THERE SOME GREATER FORCE PULLING THE STRINGS. AND IF THE COURTS RULE THAT CORPORATIONS HAVE THE SAME RELIGIOUS RIGHTS THAT WE HUMANS DO, I THINK WE'LL HAVE OUR ANSWER. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
