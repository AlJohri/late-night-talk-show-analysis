Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT DETECTED AN EARLY DETECTION TEST FOR PANCREATIC CANCER WHILE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL. TONIGHT HE'S SITTING AT THE COOL KIDS' TABLE. TONIGHT PLEASE WELCOME JACK ANDRAKA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, JACK, NICE TO MEET YOU! SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN. NICE TO HAVE YOU ON. THIS IS A FANTASTIC STORY. LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT TO THE PEOPLE WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DID. YOU'RE THE 2012 INTEL SCIENCE FAIR-- WHICH IS A NATIONAL SCIENCE FAIR, RIGHT?
INTERNATIONAL.
Stephen: MY APOLOGIES. INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE FAIR. YOU KICKED A LITTLE INTERNATIONAL BUTT IN THIS ONE. GRAND PRIZE WINNINGS SCIENTIST AT AGE 16, RIGHT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EXPLAIN TO THE GOOD PEOPLE WHAT YOUR INVENTION DID?
SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT I CREATED WAS A NEW WAY TO DETECT PANCREATIC, OVARIAN AND LUNG CANCER AND IT COSTS THREE CENTS AND TAKES FIVE MINUTES TO RUN SO IT'S LIKE A DIABETIC TEST STRIP, YOU TAKE A DROP OF BLOOD AND YOU CAN INSTANTLY DIAGNOSE THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT PERHAPS EVEN MORE INTERESTING THAN THE FACT YOU DID IT AT 16, YOU THOUGHT OF IT AT AGE 14?
YES, IN MY HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY CLASS.
Stephen: WHAT OCCURRED TO YOU? DID YOU GET HIT OVER THE HEAD AND HAVE A DREAM ABOUT -- WHAT DAWNED ON YOU?
I WAS READING A SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE, SNEAKING IT UNDER MY DESK.
Stephen: SO YOU WERE GOOFING OFF LIKE KIDS DO BY READING SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES. I KNOW HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMEN. GO AHEAD. (LAUGHTER)
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT THESE THINGS CALLED ANTIBODIES THAT LOCK A SPECIFIC PROTEIN.
Stephen: DON'T PATRONIZE ME, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. (LAUGHTER)
ESSENTIALLY I THOUGHT MAYBE I CAN STICK THESE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND MAKE SOMETHING COOL.
Stephen: SHOW THE GOOD PEOPLE THE COOL THING YOU DID.
SO HERE'S ONE OF MY TEST STRIPS AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENED --
Stephen: A TEST TRIP? LIKE A CREST WHITE STRIP? DO I PUT THIS ON MY TEETH? WHAT IS THIS?
IT'S LIKE A DIABETIC TEST STRIP. IT'S MADE OF A CARBON SUBSTANCE THAT TRACKS CERTAIN PROTEINS OUT OF YOUR BLOODSTREAM.
Stephen: CARBON LIKE CHARCOAL, THAT KIND OF CARBON.
SINGLE WALL WALLED CARBON NANO TUBES. LONG THIN TYPES OF CARBONS THAT ARE 150,000th THE DIAMETER OF YOUR HAIR. THEY'RE REALLY SMALL. THEN I CREATEDDED THIS IN MY GARAGE AND ESSENTIALLY YOU JUST STICK IT IN THERE AND YOU TAKE THIS $50 METER AND JUST PUT IT LIKE THAT AND YOU CAN SEE IF YOU HAVE PANCREATIC CANCER.
Stephen: AND DO I?
WELL, THERE'S NO BLOOD ON HERE YET.
Stephen: SO I PUT BLOOD ON HERE?
JUST A DROP OF BLOOD.
Stephen: SO YOU COULD BUY THIS ADD RADIOSHACK.
I ACTUALLY GOT THIS FROM HOME DEPOT. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU GOT INTERESTED IN THIS?
I SUPPOSE I STARTED DOING SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH WHEN I WAS IN SIXTH GRADE. MY MIDDLE SCHOOL MADE IT MANDATORY AND THEY KIND OF LIKE MADE IT INTO A "HUNGER GAMES" TYPE COMPETITION WHERE -- (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: REALLY.
IT WAS A BLOOD SPORT. THEY HUNG A LAPTOP OVER 300 KIDS AND SAID "WHOEVER WINS GET THIS IS."
Stephen: WHO WON?
I DID THREE YEARS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT USING YOUR POWERS FOR EVIL? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THIS IS THE AGE AT WHICH NORMALLY SUPERVILLAINS MAKE THE TURN.
NO, RIGHT NOW I'M WORKING ON OPEN ACCESS SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS THESE DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES AND SO NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FROM YOU CAN DO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.
Stephen: DO YOU OWN THIS?
YEAH, I HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT ON THIS TECHNOLOGY AND --
Stephen: CHA-CHING, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY FOR ME IT'S ABOUT SAVING AS MANY LIVES AS POSSIBLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE ALSO A TEENAGER. YOU GOT OTHER THINGS YOU'D LIKE TO DO WHEN YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS. IS IT HARD BEING SOMEBODY WHO'S COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT CAN DETECT CANCER AT THE SAME TIME YOU JUST ARE JUST A TEENAGER -- LIKE WHEN YOU WATCH "GLEE" DO YOU THINK TO YOURSELF "I JUST WASTED AN HOUR, VICTIM SAVED TEN PEOPLE'S LIVES."
NO, I THINK THAT HOUR WAS WELL SPENT EVERY SINGLE DAY. HOWEVER, I DO MAKE UP FOR IT BECAUSE I OFTEN SLEEP OVER IN THE LAB. I KIND OF LIKE GO INTO THE STAIRWELL AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES AND YOU CAN SPREAD THEM OUT INTO A NICE PILLOW SOMETIMES SO --
Stephen: WOW.
I MISSED MY BIRTHDAY FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS BECAUSE OF THAT. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Stephen: SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU MISSED YOUR BIRTHDAY OR NOT. (LAUGHTER) IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THE LAB WITH ADULTS. DO YOU SPEND MUCH TIME WITH OTHER TEENAGERS?
OH, YEAH, I'M NOT LIKE THAT WEIRD KID WHO JUST SPENDS ALL OF HIS TIME IN THE LAB. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WEIRD. (LAUGHTER) HOW ABOUT HOPEFUL AND VERY TALENTED KID WHO SPENDS ALL OF HIS TIME IN THE LAB. I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE HAVING SOME FUN BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO SAY FOR YOUR SOCIAL LIFE THAT'S A GREAT PICKUP LINE. YOU KNOW "HEY, DO YOU HAVE PANCREATIC CANCER? WOULD YOU LIKE TO FIND OUT?" (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JACK ANDRAKA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JACK ANDRAKA, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
