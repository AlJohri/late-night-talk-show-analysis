[EAGLE CAW]
Stephen: TONIGHT, A NEW WAY  DONATE TO CHARITY. CHANGE YOUR NAME TO ANONYMOUS SO  PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE GIVING ALL  THE TIME. [LAUGHTER] THEN, I HONOR AN UNLIKELY HERO. DID YOU KNOW JOSEF STALIN USED  TO CARPOOL? [LAUGHTER] AND MY GUEST IS OSCAR-WINNING  ACTRESS JULIE ANDREWS. I'LL ASK IF THE HILLS ARE STILL  ALIVE AFTER ALL THAT FRACKING. [LAUGHTER] A MATH PROFESSOR HAS DISCOVERED  A NEW 17-MILLION DIGIT PRIME  NUMBER. HIS OTHER DISCOVERY: HE'S VERY  LONELY. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN!"] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE SHOW. I ESPECIALLY -- I ESPECIALLY  WANT TO WELCOME THOSE TEN MEN  DOWN IN THE DUNGEON SERVING THEIR MASTER. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JUST GET OUT OF THERE, GUYS. [ LAUGHTER ] WELCOME TO TONIGHT'S KINESCOPE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. NATION, ALL OF US IN CABLE NEWS  HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BRING YOU  THE LATEST NEWS MOST RELEVANT TO YOUR LIFE. SO LET'S GET TO THE STORY  EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT: THE  FALL OF THE HOUSE OF YORK! JAMES, BRING FORTH THE TOWN  CRIERS!
THE BONES OF ENGLAND'S KING  RICHARD III ARE FINALLY FOUND.
500 YEAR OLD ROYAL REMAINS.
SCIENTISTS CONFIRM THAT  REMAINS FOUND UNDER A PARKING  LOT IN ENGLAND ARE IN FACT THOSE OF KING RICHARD III.
SHOPPERS FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN  PARKING THEIR CARS RIGHT OVER  THE REMAINS OF KING RICHARD THE III UNDER A SUPER MARKET PARKING  LOT.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT! KING RICHARD THE THIRD HAS BEEN  FOUND UNDERNEATH THE PARKING LOT  OF A SUPERMARKET! [LAUGHTER] THAT EXPLAINS WHY HIS FAMOUS  LAST WORDS WERE "MY KINGDOM FOR  A HOT POCKET!" [LAUGHTER] RICHARD THE THIRD, OF COURSE, IS [LAUGHTER] RICHARD THE THIRD, OF COURSE, IS  REMEMBERED AS AN INFAMOUS  VILLAIN, MOSTLY THANKS TO SHAKESPEARE'S FAMOUS PLAY-- I  WANT TO SAY "CORIOLANUS"? [LAUGHTER] BUT HE'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT  HISTORICAL FIGURE BECAUSE HE WAS  THE LAST KING OF THE PLANTAGENET  LINE. FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR,  PLANTAGENET MEANS HE WAS  DESCENDED FROM A PLANT. [LAUGHTER] HE WAS THE LAST ONE. QUEEN ELIZABETH, DESPITE THAT  VINE GROWING OUT OF HER HEAD, IS  INCAPABLE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS. [LAUGHTER] SO HOW DID THE SCIENTISTS KNOW  THAT THIS WAS HUNCHBACK KING,  AND NOT SOME POOR 15TH-CENTURY BRITON WHO STARVED TO DEATH  WAITING FOR A GROCERY-STORE  PARKING SPACE? [LAUGHTER] WELL, RESEARCHERS OBSERVED  "A DISTINCT SPINAL CURVATURE"  THAT WAS RICHARD III'S MOST PRONOUNCED PHYSICAL FEATURE."  THAT SETTLES IT, BECAUSE ONCE  YOU DECOMPOSE, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR STRAIGHT BONES TO REARRANGE  INTO ANY OTHER SHAPE. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, RICHARD? [LAUGHTER] BUT AS IMPORTANT AS THIS STORY  IS, I WAS A LITTLE DISTURBED  WHEN I HEARD HOW THESE BONES WERE FOUND:  THEY USED GROUND-PENETRATING  RADAR. REALLY? GROUND PENETRATING RADAR? IS THERE NO LIMIT TO HOW FAR  THESE PAPPARAZZI WILL GO IN  VIOLATING BRITISH ROYALS'  PRIVACY? [LAUGHTER] FIRST, THEY'RE TAKING  LONG-DISTANCE PHOTOS OF A  TOPLESS PRINCESS KATE. JIMMY, DO WE HAVE ANY OF THOSE  THAT AREN'T PIXELATED? [LAUGHTER] NO? DID WE CHECK? OKAY. IT'S SHAMEFUL, NATION. A RESPECTED MEMBER OF THE  MONARCHY TAKES A WELL-DESERVED,  500-YEAR UNDERGROUND VACATION TO SPEND SOME QUALITY TIME ALONE  WITH HIS "TEN WOUNDS, EIGHT OF  THEM IN THE SKULL," AND THE PRESS THINKS "YEAH,  LET'S PUT SOME PICTURES OF A  SKINLESS KING RICHARD ON PAGE  THREE. THAT'LL MOVE SOME PAPER."  YOU KNOW THE NEXT TIME HIS BODY  LEAVES A LIMO, THEY'LL BE TRYING TO GET AN UP-FEMUR SHOT. [LAUGHTER] SO I SAY, SO FIE ON YOU,  RUFFIANS! I BITE MY THUMB AT THEE. [LAUGHTER] NATION, I DON'T HAVE ALL THE  ANSWERS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN  ASKED ALL THE QUESTIONS YET. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF  THE FINGER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ♪ ♪  FOLKS, IF YOU EVER GO OUT AT  NIGHT, YOU KNOW BARS CAN BE  ROUGH. ONE MINUTE YOU'RE INNOCENTLY  POINTING OUT TO A GUY HOW MUCH  HIS GIRLFRIEND LOOKS LIKE HIS MOM, NEXT MINUTE YOU'RE PICKING  YOUR TEETH OUT OF A BOWL OF BEER  NUTS. [LAUGHTER] AND THEY'RE GETTING EVEN MORE  DANGEROUS, THANKS TO A NEW  TREND. BARS GIVING THEIR PROCEEDS TO  CHARITY-- LIKE AN OREGON BAR  THAT PLEDGED TO DONATE ALL PROFITS TO CHARITY. AND A HOUSTON BAR THAT GIVES  PATRONS A VOTE WITH EVERY DRINK  AS TO WHICH CHARITY SHOULD RECEIVE THE NEXT MONTH'S  PROFITS. OF COURSE, BY 2:00 AM, THERE ARE  FEWER VOTES FOR UNICEF AND MORE  VOTES FOR THE "MAN, I COULD REALLY GO FOR A GYRO  FOUNDATION"! [LAUGHTER] THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF  MY FINGER TO DRUNK DONATING. LOOK, I'M A CHARITABLE PERSON,  WHETHER IT'S DONORS CHOOSE OR  THE YELLOW RIBBON FUND, I LOVE GIVING AWAY YOUR MONEY. [LAUGHTER] BUT GOOD DEEDS AND BOOZE IS A  DANGEROUS COMBINATION. SURE, YOU WALK INTO A BAR, TOSS  BACK A COUPLE OF COLD ONES FOR  DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'RE  POUNDING BACK SLIPPERY NIPPLES  FOR THE SUSAN G. KOMEN  FOUNDATION. [LAUGHTER] WRONG! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SUDDENLY, YOU GOT CHARITY  GOGGLES ON STANDING ON THE BAR,  YELLING, "I'LL RAISE AWARENESS FOR ANYTHING THAT MOVES." [LAUGHTER] THE NEXT DAY YOU WAKE UP  WONDERING, "UHHH, WHO DID I FEED  AND CLOTHE LAST NIGHT?" NEXT, I LOVE REALITY TV. THAT'S WHY AT THE END OF EVERY  EPISODE OF MY SHOW, I GIVE A  SINGLE ROSE TO WHOEVER WON MY  HEART. WHAT? AGAIN? [LAUGHTER] I'M GONNA GET LUCKY. [ LAUGHTER ] REALITY TV IS ALWAYS PUTTING A  SPOTLIGHT ON THE LATEST CULTURAL  TRENDS: WHERE THE REALEST HOUSEWIVES ARE, WHO THINKS THEY  CAN DANCE, AND WHAT NOUN AMERICA  IS CURRENTLY AT WAR WITH. [LAUGHTER] WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF  THE HAT TO CBS FOR A NEW REALITY  SHOW THAT DRAWS INSPIRATION FROM A REAL WORLD ISSUE.
MORE THAN 12 MILLION  AMERICANS ARE LOOKING FOR JOBS. BUT WITH SO MANY CANDIDATES  APPLYING FOR EACH JOB OPENING,  THE ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST THEM AND THE EMPLOYER HAS ALL  THE POWER.
IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE, I'VE  BEEN ON OVER 70 INTERVIEWS.
YOU CAN SEND OUT A THOUSAND  RESUMES, YOU HAVE TO KNOW  SOMEONE TO HAVE A JOB.
NOW ONE NEW SERIES WILL TRY  AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THIS IS "THE JOB."
Stephen: YES, "THE JOB,"  WHERE CONTESTANTS BATTLE FOR  SOMEPLACE TO GO DURING THE DAY! [LAUGHTER] GAME SHOWS USED TO MAKE PEOPLE'S  FANTASIES COME TRUE, LIKE  WINNING A MILLION DOLLARS, OR GETTING CAREER MENTORSHIP FROM A  VULGAR JACK-O-LANTERN. [LAUGHTER] AND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND IN THE OBAMA ECONOMY OF  2013, THE WILDEST DREAM IS ANY  ENTRY-LEVEL JOB. HOW DOES IT WORK?
EACH WEEK, FIVE EXCEPTIONAL  CANDIDATES WILL COME TO NEW YORK  CITY FOR THE BIGGEST INTERVIEW OF THEIR LIVES FOR A CHANCE TO  LAND A DREAM JOB AT ONE OF  AMERICA'S FINEST COMPANIES.
Stephen: YOU HEARD THEM-- A  DREAM JOB, LIKE AN EDITORIAL  ASSISTANT POSITION WITH "COSMOPOLITAN." [LAUGHTER] THAT'S RIGHT, "THE" AN EDITORIAL  ASSISTANT. [LAUGHTER] THIS PIONEERING FORM OF  DESPER-TAINMENT IS SURE TO BE  SUCH A HIT, OTHER NETWORKS ARE SURE TO HAVE SPINOFFS, LIKE  "MEAL OR NO MEAL," [LAUGHTER] "AMERICANS, IDLE," AND "ARE YOU  MORE EMPLOYABLE THAN A FIFTH  GRADER?" [LAUGHTER] SO CONGRATULATIONS, CBS, FOR  BRAVELY TURNING AMERICA'S  UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM INTO AMERICA'S ENTERTAINMENT  SOLUTION. AND WITH ONE HIRE PER SHOW, "THE  JOB" SHOULD RUN FOR 12.3 MILLION  EPISODES. WHRAF LAUGH
