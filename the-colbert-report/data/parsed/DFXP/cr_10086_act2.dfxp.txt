( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, IF YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE NEWS, YOU KNOW THAT AMERICA IS IN DECLINE. WE ARE CIRCLING THE DRAIN AND OUR ONLY HOPE IS THAT WE'RE TOO FAT TO GO DOWN IT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND NOBODY KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN BILL O'REILLY.
DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIVE YEARS IN OFFICE MEDIAN INCOME HAS DROPPED, INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS ARE LESS SECURE. THE JOB MARKET REMAINS SLUGGISH. THE COUNTRY IS WEAKER. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE NOW LOOKING FOR HANDOUTS. THE U.S.A. HAS LOST ITS WILL TO CONFRONT DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK. POOR, ILL-EDUCATED WOMEN. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IS CORRUPT. THE CYNICAL ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY PEDALS GARBAGE, CRUDE BEHAVIOR AT SPORTS ARENAS IS TOLERATED.
Stephen:  YES, CRUDE BEHAVIOR IN SPORTS ARENAS. SO PEOPLE ARE SO IMPOLITE THEY REFUSE TO EVEN PARTICIPATE IN THE WAVE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND-- ( APPLAUSE ) O'REILLY KNOWS-- O'REILLY KNOWS THE SOURCE OF OUR DECLINE.
WHY IS OUR NATION IN DECLINE? TONIGHT I CAN GIVE YOU THIS-- EQUALITY IS WHAT IS HURTING PRESIDENT OBAMA. THE LEFT HAS SEIZED THAT WORD "EQUALITY" TO PUSH ITS PROGRESSIVE AGENDA. WE HAVE INCOME EQUALITY. MARRIAGE EQUALITY. GENDER EQUALITY. AND ON AND ON AND ON.
Stephen:  YES, INCOME, MARRIAGE, GENDER, ON AND ON AND ON. AND YET THOSE LAST THREE DON'T MEAN ANYTHING, BUT THEY DON'T MEAN ANYTHING EQUALLY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND BILL LAID OUT WHY FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY IS POINTLESS.
EACH HUMAN BEING IS BORN WITH ABILITIES BUT THEY ARE NOT EQUAL ABILITIES. I WILL NEVER HAVE PHYSICAL EQUALITY WITH MY FELLOW IRISH MAN SHAQUILLE O'NEAL. HE'S BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN I AM BY NATURE. I WILL NEVER BE AS SMART AS EINSTEIN. AS TALENTED AS MOZART. OR AS KIND AS MOTHER TERESA.
Stephen:  OH, COME ON, BILL, THAT LIST IS TOO MODEST. YOU'LL ALSO NEVER BE AS FAST AS USAIN BOLT, AS EMOTIONALLY MATURE AS A TODDLER, OR UNDERSTAND HOW TIDES WORK AS WELL AS A MIDDLE SCHOOLER. YOU'LL NEVER BE AS STRONG AS A SILVERBACKS GORILLA, OR BE ABLE TO CAMOUFLAGE YOURSELF AS WELL AS A FLOUNDER OR HOLD A SMALL SACK OF PAPERS TOGETHER AS WELL AS A BINDER CLIP OR HAVE THE FUEL EFFICIENCY AND SMOOTH HANDLING OF THE 2014 TOYOTA AVALON. O'REILLY'S LOGIC IS AIRTIGHT. SOME PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT SOME THINGS THAN OTHER PEOPLE ARE AT THAT THING. SO TRYING TO ACHIEVE EQUALITY IS UNNATURAL. TAKE INCOME INEQUALITY. SHAQUILLE O'NEAL IS TALLER THAN BILL O'REILLY. THEREFORE, THE RICHEST 1% OF AMERICANS SHOULD CONTROL 40% OF THE NATION'S WEALTH. ( LAUGHTER ) AND BILL IS NOT QUITE AS GOOD LOOKING AS GEORGE CLOONEY, SO MEN SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO MARRY EACH OTHER, NOT EVEN BILL AND GEORGE WHICH IS TOO BAD BECAUSE THE KIDS WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL. ( LAUGHTER ) THE POINT IS IF BILL O'REILLY IS NO EINSTEIN-- AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE HE'S NOT-- THEN EQUALITY IS FOREVER OUT OF OUR REACH.
THE TRUTH IS THERE WILL NEVER BE EQUALITY IN THIS WORLD. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, AN OPIUM-LACED DREAM.
Stephen:  YES, I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT DR. KING WAS TALKING ABOUT IN HIS "I HAVE AN OPIUM-LACED DREAM" SPEECH. COME ON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE AREN'T ANY MOUNTAINTOPS ON THE WASHINGTON MALL. THAT GUY WAS TRIPPING BALLS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
