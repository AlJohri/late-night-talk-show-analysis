EVERYBODY. [CROWD CHEERING] EVERY DAY OUT THERE YOU HEAR ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT RAISING TAXPAYER MONEY ON USELESS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. STUDIES ON DO YOU RECOLLECT PEEN -- DUCK MIGRATION. IT'S D AND A ALPHABETICAL. PREPARE THE MICHIGAN TECH UNIVERSITY HAS FINALLY DONE SOMETHING USEFUL BY SEARCHING THE INTERNET FOR EVIDENCE OF TIME TRAVELERS. [LAUGHTER] TO TELL US HOW WE TURNED TO KTBC OFTEN NEWS LEADER.
TO SEE IF THEY COULD SPOT A TIME TRAVEL BY SEARCHING FOR EVENTS THAT HAVEN'T HAPPENED YET. FOR EXAMPLE THEY LOOK FOR POPE FRANCIS BACK IN 2011.
Stephen:  IT SEEMS LOGICAL IF YOU'RE AN ADVANCED CIVILIZATION FROM THE FUTURE THAT HAS FINALLY UNRAVELED THE MYSTERIES OF SPACE TIME YOU BLOW YOUR COVER WITH HASH TAB POPE FRANCIS. ALTHOUGH IF I COULD TIME TRAVEL I WOULD GO BACK TO 1930'S GERMANY AND COME UP BEHIND HITLER. TODAY THAT'S THE POLAND ADOLPH, THAT'S THE POLAND. I'VE HAD IT. [CROWD CHEERING] UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THE SIZE OF THE SEARCH NEW TIME TRAVELERS WERE DISCOVERED. YET SOMEHOW, I KNOW THAT IN THE FUTURE THESE GUYS WON'T BE RECEIVING ANY MORE RESEARCH GRANTS. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, THAT SETTLES IT. TIME TRAVEL DOES NOT EXIST.
NOT SO FAST STEPHEN COLBERT.
Stephen:  WHO ARE YOU?
I'M THE TIME TRAVELING BRANDY THIEF. I HAVE APPEARED ON YOUR SHOW IN THE PAST. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen:  GREAT. IN THE PAST. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
OH, IS IT. THEN WHERE DID I GET THIS NEWSPAPER DATED YESTERDAY.
Stephen:  OH MY GOD. SO YOU'RE TELLING ME TIME TRAVEL DOES EXIST.
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THE ANSWER IN THE BOTTLE OF BRANDY UNDER YOUR DESK.
Stephen:  THERE'S A BOTTLE OF BRANDY UNDER MY DESK.
NOT ANYMORE, HA HA HA.
Stephen:  BRANDY THIEF.
WHILE WE'RE AT IT COLBERT, IS THIS YOUR CAR.
Stephen:  I NEVER PICKED A CARD.
PICK A CARD. OH MY GOD. IT IS. [APPLAUSE]
YOU SEE STEPHEN WHAT YOU FAILED IS A STUDY DISPROVED TIME TRAVEL MAY HAVE DONE THE OPPOSITE.
Stephen:  ARE YOU SUGGESTING WE MAY ALL BE TIME TRAVELERS, THAT THE PRESENT IS IN FACT JUST A FUTURE OF PEOPLE RIDING THE TIME STREAM FROM THE PAST?
UH, YES, YES. MAYBE I DON'T KNOW. I'M GETTING A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT WHOSE FROM THE FUTURE AND WHOSE NOT. WHAT YEAR IS IT?
Stephen:  2014.
THANK GOD, I JUST WROTE 2013 ON A CHECK THIS MORNING. I MUST TRAVEL TO THE FUTURE AND CALL MY BANK. POOF. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]
Stephen:  WHERE DID HE GO. THE TIME TRAVELING
