Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN EMMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR CURRENTLY STARRING IN "HOMELAND." PLEASE WELCOME MANDY PATINKIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MANDY. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK. WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
Stephen:  AND EVEN-- EVEN BETTER TO HAVE YOU HERE TO HAVE YOUR BEARD BACK. IT'S SO-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO LOVELY.
IT JUST BRINGS ME ALONG WHEREVER IT GOES.
Stephen:  YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T HAVE ONE FOR ABOUT A YEAR, RIGHT? YOU TOOK IT OFF.
I DID. I TOOK IT OFF THE MINUTE I FINISHED SHOOTING.
Stephen:  OKAY--
BECAUSE I FEEL YOUNGER.
Stephen:  REALLY?
WITHOUT IT.
Stephen:  DON'T GET ME WRONG. YOU'VE GOT, AS MY PEOPLE SAY, A LOVELY LITTLE PUTTUM THERE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  THE FACT THAT THE BEARD IS BACK LETS ME KNOW THAT "HOMELAND" CANNOT BE FAR AWAY. THE NEW SEASON STARTS OCTOBER 5. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID YOU KNOW THAT THE SHOW WAS GOING TO BE LESS FRIGHTENING THAN REALITY? ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE THE WORLD HAS GONE MAD. THE WORLD HAS GONE CRAZY SINCE THE LAST TIME YOU GUYS WERE ON THE AIR.
YES.
Stephen:  WHAT IS THAT LIKE AS AN ARTIST?
SAD.
Stephen:  UH-HUH.
A BIT OVERWHELMING AT TIMES.
Stephen:  UH-HUH.
WHEN I GET UP EVERY DAY, I READ THE NEWSPAPER ON MY PHONE. I DRIVE TO WORK. I HEAR THE HEADLINES ON THE RADIO. AND IT'S OVERWHELMING.
Stephen:  IT'S LIKE THEY'RE STEALING YOUR SCRIPTS. ( LAUGHTER ).
IT IS, BUT I HAVE AN ANTIDOTE FOR IT ALL. I HAVE A SOLUTION THAT I'VE COME UP WITH THAT I THINK WILL BALANCE MY PARTICIPATION IN THIS WORLD FOR HOWEVER LONG I MIGHT HAVE LEFT TO BE IN IT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN JOINING ME.
Stephen:  UH, YES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). YEAH, I WILL JOIN YOU-- I WILL JOIN YOU IN WHATEVER THE ANSWER IS.
WELL, GIVEN THE STATE OF THE WORLD AND ITS EPICENTER, WHICH I FEEL IS THE MIDDLE EAST --
Stephen:  I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE MIDDLE EAST, DO I?
NO, YOU CAN DO IT ALL FROM THIS STUDIO, IF YOU'D PREFER. BUT AS SOON AS THIS SEASON FINISHES, SEASON FOUR OF "HOMELAND," I AM GOING TO TEAR A PAGE OUT OF YOUR BOOK, YOUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN BOOK, AND I AM GOING TO ENTER MYSELF TO BE POSSIBLY ELECTED AS THE NEW PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WHAT DO I DO?
I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT GIVEN YOUR RIGHT WING POINT OF VIEW ON OCCASION --
Stephen:  I CONSIDER MYSELF AN INDEPENDENT, BUT GO AHEAD.
THAT YOU WOULD BE MY SECURITY ADVISER. BECAUSE SECURITY IS PARAMOUNT IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD, AND, THEREFORE, I FEEL THAT WITH YOU AS THE HEAD OF SECURITY AND ME AS THE HEAD OF MORAL AND ETHICAL ATTITUDE TOWARD HUMANITY, THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO MIGHT CALM THE REGION INTO, ON OCCASION, LAUGHING AT ITSELF, WHICH ON OCCASION, MAYBE YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF IT --
Stephen:  I'M NOT.
BUT PEOPLE LAUGH AT YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  REALLY? THERE'S NO GREATER-- THERE'S NO GREATER COUNTRY THAN AMERICA. DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS?
AMERICA?
Stephen:  THE BEAUTIFUL.
THE GREAT-- YOU THINK IT'S THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD?
Stephen:  GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
IT MIGHT BE-- IT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE GREATEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE SHOOTING SEASON FOUR OF "HOMELAND" IN CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA, AND I CAN'T GET OVER THAT I'M PRIVILEGED TO BE IN THAT PLACE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE WORLD'S STATE OF BEING, BEING SO HORRIFYING, I'M LIVING IN A PLACE WHERE A SELF-CONFESSED TERRORIST, NAMED NELSON MANDELA, WAS IMPRISONED FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, AND CAME OUT OF THAT PRISONER SITUATION WITHOUT VENGEANCE. AND WITH --
Stephen:  WHY SHOULD HE COME OUT WITHOUT VENGEANCE. HE WAS A SELF-PROFESSED TERRORIST. WE WENT TO JAIL. HE PAID HIS DEBT TO SOCIETY. HE SHOULD COME OUT AND APOLOGIZE.
WELL --
Stephen:  NO, NO, NO, DON'T YOU AH ME IF I ATTACK NELSON MANDELA.
AND YOU AREN'T THE FIRST TO ATTACK NELSON MANDELA BEFORE APARTHEID WAS DISSOLVED AND AFTER APARTHEID WAS DISSOLVED. THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO WISH APARTHEID IS IN PLACE. MAYBE YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.
Stephen:  DON'T YOU DARE SAY I'M PRO-APARTHEID. I'M JUST FOR WHATEVER WORKS.
FINE.
Stephen:  LAW AND ORDER. LAW AND ORDER. I'M FOR ARMING THE POLICE WITH TANKS.
IN THAT CASE, THEN I THINK AMERICA IS A BETTER PLACE FOR YOU THAN SOUTH AFRICA AT THIS POINT IN TIME.
Stephen:  AMERICA IS A BETTER PLACE THAN ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD.
GOOD.
Stephen:  OKAY? ARE YOU-- ARE YOU PART OF THE "BLAME AMERICA" CROWD?
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH SOME OF AMERICA'S POLICIES IN SOME INSTANCES.
Stephen:  OH, REALLY?
YES.
LOOK, I'M SORRY YOU'RE NOT. I'M SORRY, YOU THINK IT'S A PERFECT COUNTRY. I'M SORRY YOU THINK OUR POLICIES AROUND THE WORLD --
Stephen:  IT'S NOT A PERFECT COUNTRY. SOME AMERICANS DON'T LOVE OUR COUNTRY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MANDY, MANDY, WOULD DO YOU ONE THING FOR ME?
MAKE ME.
Stephen:  OKAY, YOU ARE SUCH A COMFORTING PRESENCE.
OH, THANK YOU STEPHEN. DO YOU WANT ME TO HOLD YOU.
Stephen:  NO, WOULD YOU-- IN A MOMENT--
COME HERE, COME HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  I WOULD LIKE YOU-- I WOULD LIKE YOU TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA, AND WOULD YOU JUST SAY TO THE WORLD-- A WORRIED WORLD. THERE'S A WORRIED WORLD OUT THERE. NOW, WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST LOOK INTO THE CAMERA.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen:  A WORRIED WORLD AND WITH-- YOU KNOW, USE ALL YOUR POWERS. SAY THOSE WORDS. MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER. BUT AT THE CORE, LET US KNOW YOU'RE NOT SURE IF IT'S TRUE. ( LAUGHTER ).
THERE, THERE. EVERYTHING. WILL BE. OKAY.
Stephen:  MANDY PATINKIN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
