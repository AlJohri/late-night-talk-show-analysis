Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. WE'RE AT THE CLINTON GLOBAL  INITIATIVE UNIVERSITY WITH THE  NAMESAKE PRESIDENT BILL GLOBAL. SIR, LET ME ASK YOU THIS, WHEN  YOU THESE PEOPLE'S AGE YOU WERE  GETTING INTO POLITICS. WOULD YOU ADVISE PEOPLE AT THIS  AGE TO GET INTO POLITICS NOW OR  WOULD YOU ADVISE THEM TO GET INTO NGOS?
FIRST OF ALL THEY ARE NOT ALL  GOING TO GET INTO POLITICS AS  CANDIDATES. BUT IF THEY HAVE AN INTEREST, I  WOULD ADVISE THEM TO DO IT. I FEEL VERY PRIF LEBLGED TO  HAVE -- PRIVILEGED TO HAVE HAD  THE LIFE I HAVE AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT EVEN IF THEY  GET IN NGO WORK THEY SHOULD BE  INVOLVED IN ELECTION WORK. A BIG PART OF THE LAST LAST, FOR  EXAMPLE, WAS TURNED BY PEOPLE  PART OF VAST SOCIAL NETWORKS THAT OPERATED IN THE REAL WORLD,  TOO. THIS CAMPAIGN WAS THE HIGHEST  POINT YET IN OUR POLITICS IN  AMERICA ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF USING THE SOCIAL NETWORKS TO  ACTIVATE PEOPLE WHO WORKED DOOR  TO DOOR FACE TO FACE WITH  PEOPLE.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THAT  YOU DON'T USE ALL OF THE  INTERNET. YOU DON'T E-MAIL, YOU DON'T  FACEBOOK, YOU ARE NOT  PINTERESTING.
I DO FACEBOOK.
Stephen: DO YOU TWEET?
NO, I THINK I'M INSECURE LIKE  IT'S -- YOU KNOW, WHAT IF YOU  TWEET AND NOBODY TWEETS BACK? WHAT IF YOU TWEET AND YOU  HAVE -- IF YOU ARE -- THERE'S  NOTHING WORSE THAN A FRIENDLESS  TWEETER. YOU ARE WANDERING AROUND IN  CYBERSPACE. I DO A LOT OF -- I TEXT WITH MY  FAMILY AND WITH TWO MY CHIEF OF  STAFF ON MY CELL PHONE. THAT'S ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, WHEN I  BECAME PRESIDENT THERE WAS NO  E-MAIL. THEN E-MAIL WAS LARGELY  INTEROFFICE.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU  COMMUNICATE?
TELEPHONE, SNAIL MAIL. BLAH BLAH. WHAT HAPPENED WAS. AFTER I WAS PRESIDENT THERE WERE  BLIZZARDS OF E-MAILS WITHIN THE  ADMINISTRATION, THE CONGRESS SUBPOENAED THEM ALL AND ALL  THESE YOUNG PEOPLE DRUNK WITH  THE POWER OF NEW TECHNOLOGY SAID THE FIRST THINGS THAT CAME TO  THEIR HEADS SO SOME OF THESE  E-MAILS WERE MILDLY  EMBARRASSING.
Stephen: YOU DO NOT  PRESENTLY TWEET? SIR, I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF  OPENING YOU A TWITTER ACCOUNT. NOW, PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS  TAKEN, WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON  WAS TAKEN. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT PRES BILLY JEFF WAS  AVAILABLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WOULD YOU LIKE TO BREAK INTO THE  21ST CENTURY RIGHT NOW AND SEND  YOUR FIRST TWEET? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU'LL TYPE IT?
Stephen: I'LL TYPE IT. 140 CHARACTERS OR LESS.
JUST SPENT.
Stephen: JUST SPENT.
AMAZING TIME WITH COLBERT. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: SOUND GOOD?
QUESTION -- IS HE SANE? [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: IS HE SANE?

Stephen: CAN I PUT AN  EXCLAMATION MARK AT THE END  AFTER THIS, SIR.
I HAVEN'T USED 140, YOU CAN.
Stephen: ANYTHING ELSE?
NO, NO, I'M DONE.
Stephen: JUST SPENT AN  AMAZING TIME WITH COLBERT. HE IS SANE? HE IS COOL. #CGI. EXACTLY. TWEET. SIR, WELCOME TO THE FUTURE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU PRESIDENT WILLIAM  JEFFERSON CLINTON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
