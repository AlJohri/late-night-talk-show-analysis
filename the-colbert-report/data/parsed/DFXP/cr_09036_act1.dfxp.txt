Stephen: TONIGHT, A NEW  THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA. HOW WILL MACH EYE AND KLINGER  HAND THIS WILL ONE? (LAUGHTER)  THEN, CAN HOMOSEXUALITY BE  CURED? AND WHAT WILL THAT MEAN FOR  BRAVO'S RATINGS? (LAUGHTER)  PLUS, MY GUEST, AUTHOR MALCOLM  GLADWELL WROTE THE FORWARD THE  NEW YORKER'S "BIG BOOK OF DOGS." I WONDER IF "DOG FANCY" HAS A  "BIG BOOK OF GLADWELLS."  (LAUGHTER)  IT'S NOW LEGAL TO CARRY A CONCEALED WEAPON IN ALL 50  STATES. SO IF YOU ARE IN ONE OF THEM, BE  CAREFUL. (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE  "REPORT," FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. IT'S GREAT TO BE ME. NATION, IT'S A SPECIAL TIME OF  THE YEAR. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO IT  FOR MONTHS NOW. AND WHEREVER YOU GO YOU CAN SEE  THE TWINKLE IN LITTLE CHILDREN'S  EYES BECAUSE THEY KNOW IN A FEW SHORT WEEKS  ♪ THE FISCAL CLIFF IS COMING TO  TOWN ♪  MERRY CLIFFMAS! (LAUGHTER)  AND WITH A DRAMATIC NAME LIKE  FISCAL CLIFF, IT'S GOT TO BE  EXCITING. JIM?
THE PRESIDENT IS ASKING FOR  $1.6 TRILLION IN REVENUE.
$600 BILLION IN TAX HIKES.
ENTITLEMENT REFORM.
DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS.
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHAT HAPPENED, IS IT OVER? (BLEEP) OAK, FOLKS, I'LL ADMIT  IT. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE  FISCAL CLIFF AND YOU DON'T WANT  TO HEAR ABOUT IT. FOR THE NEXT 20 DAYS, ALL PUNDIT  ARE CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO  TALK BUDGETARY POLICY AND YOU THE VIEWER ARE OBLIGATED TO  LISTEN. CHECK YOUR CABLE CONTRACT. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S RIGHT BELOW THE PART WHERE  COME CAST GETS YOUR KIDNEYS. THEY'LL BE THERE TO PICK THEM UP  TOMORROW BETWEEN THE HOURS OF  9:00 A.M. AND 6:00 P.M. WEAR SOMETHING LOOSE. (LAUGHTER)  IF THE PARTIES HERE CANNOT AGREE  TO A BUDGET DEAL BY JANUARY 1,  AUTOMATIC SPENDING CUTS WILL KICK IN AND PLUNGE AMERICA INTO  A SECOND RECESSION THINGS ARE  NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD.
IN WASHINGTON, A FLY IN THE  OINTMENT. DEBT DEAL NEGOTIATIONS HAVE  STALLED.
THE FISCAL CLIFF STALEMATE  REMAINS.
THE STANDOFF CONTINUES. THERE ISN'T A LOT OF REASON FOR  HOPE.
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE  BLAMING EACH OTHER FOR THE  STALLED NEGOTIATIONS.
WHO'S GOING TO BLINK SGLIRS  WHAT'S GOING TO BLINK FIRST.
THE WHITE HOUSE IS DARING  REPUBLICANS LITERALLY TO BLINK. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OBAMA IS DARING  REPUBLICANS LITERALLY TO BLINK. WELL, THE JOKE'S ON HIM! (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE I KNOW SOME REPUBLICANS  WHO HAD THEIR EYELIDS SURGICALLY  REMOVED. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW OBAMA WON'T BUDGE OFF HIS  CALLS FOR $1.6 TRILLION IN NEW TAX REVENUE OVER THE COMING  DECADE, MOSTLY FROM INCREASING  TAX RATES AND TAXES ON UPPER-BRACKET EARNERS. FOLKS, THAT'S JUST PUNISHING OUR  NATION'S JOB CREATORS. AMERICA'S BILLIONAIRES ARE THE  ENGINE THAT DRIVES OUR ECONOMY  THROUGH SMART INVESTMENTS! AND OCCASIONALLY THROUGH DUMB  ONES. (LAUGHTER)  TODAY HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER  STRUCK BACK WITH HIS PLAN TO CUT  SPENDING BY DEMANDING OBAMA COME UP WITH BOEHNER'S PLAN TO CUT  SPENDING. (LAUGHTER)
A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT THE  PRESIDENT AND I MET ON SUNDAY IT  WAS A NICE MEETING, IT WAS CORDIAL BUT WE'RE STILL WAITING  FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO IDENTIFY  WHAT SPENDING CUTS THE PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO MAKE, WHERE ARE  THE PRESIDENTS SPENDING CUTS?
Stephen: NOW CRITICS SAY THE  SPEAKER IS JUST ASKING DEMOCRATS  TO PUT SPECIFICS IN INTO THE REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL BUT I SAY  THAT'S KIND OF FUN. IT MAKES THE BUDGET INTO A GIANT  MAD-LIB. FOR INSTANCE, WE AGREE TO CUT  TEN BE ZILLION FROM THE PROGRAM  THAT GIVES UKULELES TO THE STICKY POOR. TOILET BOOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY  -- IF I HAVE TO. (LAUGHTER)  NATION, THERE'S A DANGER LURKING  AROUND EVERY CORNER. THAT'S WHY I SAY WE MUST START  MAKING ALL OF OUR BUILDINGS  ROUND. (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS THE THREAT DOWN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FIRST UP, FOLKS, I ALWAYS KEEP  WATCH ON OUR INTERNATIONAL ENEMIES, ESPECIALLY NORTH KOREA. AND THEIR DEAR LEADER KIM  JONG-UN. IN MY BOOK HE IS PUBLIC ENEMY  NUMBER UN. (LAUGHTER)  SO I WAS TERRIFIED TO LEARN THAT  PYONGYANG'S HISTORY INSTITUTE OF  THE D.P.R.K. ACADEMY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES MADE THIS SHOCKING  DISCOVERY.
AN EYEBROW-RAISING  ANNOUNCEMENT OUT OF NORTH KOREA. THE STATE NEWS AGENCY THERE  CLAIMS THAT ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE  JUST LOCATED AN ANCIENT UNICORN  LAIR. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. NORTH KOREA HAS UNICORN  TECHNOLOGY. (LAUGHTER)  THEY SAID I WAS CRAZY WHEN I  CALLED FAR GLITTER DEFENSE  SHIELD ARMED WITH BALLISTIC SPARKLEY STICKERS. (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, THIS BRINGS ME TO THREAT  NUMBER TWO, COMMIE UNICORNS. (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS A HUGE BOON TO NORTH  KOREA. AND NOT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE  THERE HAS FINALLY FOUND A SOURCE  OF PROTEIN. TO MAKE THIS EARTH-SHATTERING  DISCOVERY, NORTH KOREAN  ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAD TO TRAVEL 200 METERS FROM A TEMPLE IN THE  CAPITAL CITY PYONGYANG AND THEN  LOOK DOWN TO SEE A RECTANGULAR ROCK CARVED WITH THE WORDS  "UNICORN LAIR."  (LAUGHTER)  IT MAKES SENSE IT'S LABELED, HOW ELSE WOULD THE MAILMAN KNOW  WHERE TO DELIVER THE RAINBOWS? (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, LISTEN TO ME HERE THIS  HAS DANGEROUS GEOPOLITICAL  RAMIFICATIONS BECAUSE IT GIVES HISTORICAL LEGITIMACY TO THE  REGIME OF KIM JONG-UN BY LINKING  HIM TO AN ANCIENT RULER WHO ACCORDING TO KOREA'S HISTORY  BOOKS ROAD A UNICORN AND, AS A  KEY QLAN, HE ROAD IT GANGNAM  STYLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ONE SECOND, I JUST WANT TO WRITE  DOWN THE LAST TIME I AM LEGALLY ALLOWED TO REFERENCE GANGNAM  STYLE. (LAUGHTER)  GET THAT OFF TO THE LIBRARY OF  CONGRESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HERE'S THE DANGER, FOLKS THIS  WILL ATTRACT IMPRESSIONABLE  AMERICAN GIRLS TO COMMUNISM. LOOK AT THIS TRADITIONAL  RENDERING OF A NORTH KOREAN  UNICORN. WHAT LITTLE GIRL WOULDN'T LOVE  TO CUDDLE UP WITH A CATFISH  FACED REPTILIAN HORSE BEAST? (LAUGHTER)  DON'T DO IT, GIRLS! BECAUSE WE'VE GOT BETTER  MYTHICAL CREATURES RIGHT HERE IN  AMERICA LIKE BIG FOOT! OR A MODERATE REPUBLICAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HEY, IT COULD BE OUT THERE. MAYBE DAVID BROOKS WILL LET YOU  BRAID HIS HAIR. (LAUGHTER)  NEXT UP THE RECESSION HIT MEN  PARTICULARLY HARD AND THIS  MANSESSION HAS AFFECTED TRADITIONAL GENDER ROLES. WITH THE COLLAPSE OF HOME  BUILDING FORMER CONSTRUCTION  WORKERS ARE STAYING HOME WITH THEIR KIDS AND ACCORDING TO THE  "NEW YORK TIMES" SOME RETAILERS  ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS  TREND.
BARBIE HAS A NEW ACCESSORY  AND IT'S A TOOL BELT. THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTS  MATTEL IS INTRODUCING A  CONSTRUCTION SET FOR BARBIE.
Stephen: FOLKS A CONSTRUCTION  SET IS NO PLACE FOR BARBIE,  THOSE ERECTOR SET WORKERS ARE GOING TO CAT CALL HER AND ASK  HER TO BACK IT UP LIKE A TONKA  TRUCK. (LAUGHTER)  WHICH BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER  ONE: FOREMAN BARBIE. I'M SORRY BUT I'M AGAINST THIS  NEW MEGABLOCKS CONSTRUCTION SET  BARBIE. SHE CAN'T OPERATE HEAVY  MACHINERY. BARBIE'S ANKLES AREN'T EVEN LOAD  BEARING. (LAUGHTER)  BESIDES, KEN HAS MORE CARPENTRY  EXPERIENCE. REMEMBER, HE LOST HIS GENITALS  IN A TABLE SAW ACCIDENT. AND FOLKS THAT'S -- OKAY, I'LL  TELL YOU WHY THERE'S A  MANSESSION, BARBIE HERE IS HOGGING ALL THE JOBS SHE'S A  DOCTOR, AN ASTRONAUT, A RACE CAR  DRIVER, A POLICE OFFICER, A FLIGHT ATTENDANT, A COMPUTER  ENGINEER, A FIREFIGHTER, A  DENTIST, A PAIL I DON'T KNOW TOLGSZ AND A FOX NEWS ANCHOR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SO BARBIE, LEAVE THESE JOBS FOR  THE FELLAS. YOU'RE GIVING MEN A BAD  SELF-IMAGE AND YOU'RE ONLY  SUPPOSED TO DO THAT TO GIRLS! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
