Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU SO MUCH, WHAT A CROWD! WHAT A CROWD. STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DO YOU FEEL THAT? DO YOU FEEL THAT WAVE OF LOVE? WHAT A LUCKY MAN AM I (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE, SIT DOWN. NATION, THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS CLOSER THAN YOU THINK, UNLESS YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT TWO YEARS AWAY. BUT THE RACE WAS JUST ROCKED BY A BOMBSHELL POLL CONDUCTED BY STATISTICAL SAVANT AND COCKIEST GUY IN YOUR FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE NATE SILVER. IN 2012 WHEN HE WAS STILL WORKING AT THE "NEW YORK TIMES"  SILVER NAILED EVERY ONE OF HIS ELECTION PREDICTIONS. NOW HE'S OVER AT ESPN. BUT HE'S STILL DOING VITAL ANALYSIS. CASE IN POINT, HIS RECENT POLL COMPARING THE  FAVORABILITY RATINGS OF STAR WARS CHARACTERS. (LAUGHTER) YES, NATE SILVER IS NOW OFFICIALLY IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM JOURNALISM. THE STAR WARS RESULTS WERE THEN PICKED UP BY "THE WASHINGTON POST" WHO FURTHER CRUNCHED THE NUMBERS. AND FOUND THAT DARTH VADER IS POLLING HIGHER THAN ALL POTENTIAL 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THIS IS SHOCKING. A GROUP OF BROADLY OUTLANDISH UNBELIEVABLE CHARACTERS ARE LESS POPULAR THAN THE PEOPLE FROM AS FAR WARS-- STAR WARS. LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO THE RESULT, EVERYBODY. YOU GOT EMPEROR PALPATINE RUNNING EVENING WITH MARCO RUBIO. NOW MANY PEOPLE EXPECTED PALPATINE TO DO BETTER AGAINST THE FLORIDA SENATOR BUT REMEMBER IN FLORIDA THEY'RE SUSPICIOUS OF ANYONE WEARING A HOODIE. AND WITH GOOD REASON, WITH GOOD REASON. AND ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE, HILLARY CLINTON IS TRAILING WELL BEHIND YODA WHO, AT 900 YEARS OLD STILL GETS FEWER FOX NEWS QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS AGE HE LOOKS GOOD, HAD A LITTLE WORK DONE, HE HAS. NOW SOME WILL SAY THAT LUMPING TWO UNRELATED POLLS TOGETHER IS LIKE COMPARING CORELIAN APPLES TO MANDALORIAN ORANGES-- LOOK IT UP-- BALL'S IN YOUR COURT JON STEWART. BUT NATION, THESE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. SO BASED ON THESE RESULTS I'M OFFICIALLY ENDORSING DARTH VADER FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, LET'S FACE IT, THE ELECTORATE IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE DIVERSE AND THERE'S NO QUESTION HE IS A STRONG BLACK CANDIDATE. (LAUGHTER) AND HE'S GOT A PLAN TO PUT AMERICANS BACK TO WORK WITH A MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. PLUS LORD VADER IS A VETERAN FIGHTER PILOT WHO KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK IN AN OVAL OFFICE. SO VOTE VADER-BINKS 2016, MESAH PROVE THIS MESSAGE. NATION--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, I'VE GOT SOMETHING ON MY MIND AND NOW I'M GOING SMEAR IT ALL OVER YOURS. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST UP ON T TO THE DUBS, I'M HOOKED ON THE HBO SHOW "TRUE BLOOD" AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO  FOX NEWS ANCHOR SHEPARD SMITH WHO DROPPED A FEW SUBTLE HINTS ABOUT HOW MUCH HE ENJOYS IT.
DO YOU WATCH THAT SHOW TRUE BLOOD?
SUNDAY IS EPISODE 2 OF TRUE BLOOD.
TRUE BLOOD IS BACK. I'M TELLING YOU, DON'T DRINK THE V COME ON, DON'T DRINK THE V.
DON'T DRINK THE V, THANK YOU, MIKE, DON'T DRINK THE V.
DO YOU NOT WATCH TRUE BLOOD, BECAUSE YOU CAN GET ALL  AMPED UP ON V AND DO ALL KINDS OF WEIRD THINGS.
Stephen: YEAH. ALL KINDS OF WEIRD THINGS LIKE THAT ONE TIME SHEP GAVE OUT HIS HBO GO PASSWORD AND THEN DEMANDED PEOPLE WATCH TRUE BLOOD WHILE HOLDING A KNIFE TO BRIT HUME'S THROAT. WHICH IS WHY I AM SO SAD TO GIVE A WAG OF MY FINGER TO "TRUE BLOOD" FOR MAKING MY BLOOD TRULY BOIL WITH LAST WEEK'S EPISODE IN WHICH THE VAMPIRE SNUCK INTO A BENEFIT FOR TED CRUZ IN A TRANSPARENT HOLLYWOOD ATTACK ON REPUBLICANS.
THE SECOND I TOLD HER THAT'S WHERE MOMMY AND DADDY  WERE GOING, SHE HUNG UP.
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO A GALA.
SECURITY'S GOING TO BE TIGHT.
AND THEY ONLY INVITED ASSHOLES WE CAN BE ASSHOLES OF ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS I HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST 100 YEARS THIS COULD BE THE MOST DISTURBING
OH MY GOD-- I'M A REPUBLI-[BLEEP].
Stephen: DID YOU HEAR THAT? DID YOU HEAR THAT, A REPUBL-C WORD I CAN'T SAY. WELL PLAYED HOLLYWOOD, THAT IS THE MOST DEVASTATING CRITIQUE OF A POLITICAL IDEOLOGY SINCE KARL MARX PUBLISHED "DAS KAPI-TAINT" AND I'M NOT THE ONLY CONSERVATIVE UPSET BY TRUE BLOOD'S BLEEDING HEART INTO MOUTH AGENDA.
SUNDAY NIGHT'S EPISODE OF TRUE BLOOD SERIES WAS A CONSERVATIVE BASHFEST. BUT THE VULGARITY OF ATTACKS HAS MANY ASKING DID THE SHOW GO TOO FAR?
FOLKS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT TV IS ALL ABOUT ATTITUDE IMPLANTATION, IT'S ALL ABOUT CREATING FEELINGS INSIDE OF YOU. HERE IS THE THING, MOST PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHO TED CRUZ IS. THEY TEND TO VOTE BASED ON THE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAVE, LARGELY IMPLANTED BY THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.
Stephen: WELL SAID. TV ENTERTAINMENT DRIVES OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE. REMEMBER NO ONE WAS TALKING ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY UNTIL THE DEBUT OF "TWO BROKE GIRLS" BUT WE-- WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED AT ALL THAT VAMPIRES ARE DEMOCRATS. AFTER ALL, THEY SCREAM WHEN THEY SEE A CROSS. (LAUGHTER) NEXT UP-- NEXT UP, FOLKS, GIVE ME A SECOND HERE, I WANT TO MAKE SURE I GOT MY PLASTIC TARP DOWN BECAUSE THE NEXT STORY MAKES ME SO HAPPY I MIGHT START LEAKING NEWS JUICE, JIM.
OBAMACARE SUFFERS PERHAPS ITS BIGGEST SETBACK YET.
A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RULING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AS WRITTEN ONLY ALLOWS INSURANCE SUBSIDIES IN STATES THAT SET UP THEIR OWN EXCHANGES.
COVERAGE FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ENROLLED UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE LAW MAY BE IN JEOPARDY.
BIG BLOW FOR OBAMACARE AND WE'RE ACCURATE IN SAYING IT IS A HUGE BLOW FOR OBAMACARE.
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW A NEWS ORGANIZATION IS TRUSTWORTHY. THEY MAKE THE EXTRA EFFORT TO POINT OUT WHEN THEY'RE BEING ACCURATE. (LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, THEY ARE, THIS TIME. OBAMACARE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: MAKE NO MISTAKE, THEY ARE ACCURATE IN SAYING THAT OBAMACARE IS DEAD. NOW THE LAST TIME I DECLARED OBAMACARE DEAD I DROPPED BALLOONS AND THEN TWERKED WITH THE GRIM REAPER. SO FOLKS, THAT'S ALL BEEN DONE. BUT LIKE VOTING TO REPEAL OBAMACARE, WE ARE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. COME ON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHOOO!  ♪ ♪ KUZ I'M HAPPY  ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HE'S A GOOD GUY. DEATH IS A GOOD GUY AND A HELL OF A DANCER. AND THIS HAPPY NEWS BRINGS ME TO THE TIP OF THE HAT TO THE WASHINGTON D.C. COURT OF APPEALS YOU SEE, IN A 2-1 VOTE THE COURT THIS WEEK RULED THAT RESIDENTS OF THE 36 STATES THAT HAVE NOT SET UP THEIR OWN OBAMACARE INSURANCE EXCHANGES CANNOT GET FEDERAL HEALTH CARE SUBSIDIES BECAUSE THE EXACT WORDS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SAY THAT SUBSIDIES ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE, QUOTE, ENROLLED IN THROUGH AN EXCHANGE ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE. AND BECAUSE IT'S WRITTEN EXACTLY THAT WAY THE COURT RULED THAT SUBSIDIES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE ON STATE-BASED EXCHANGES, NOT ON THE HEALTH CARE.GOV EXCHANGE AND THEY BASE IT ON THE WELL ESTABLISHED PRECEDENT, YOU FORGOT TO SAY SIMON SAYS. (APPLAUSE) NATION, 5.6-- 5.6 MILLION PEOPLE COULD NOW LOSE THEIR INSURANCE BECAUSE OF THIS PHRASEOLOGY. I BELIEVE THIS IS A TRIUMPH OF TYPO OVER INTENT. THE DEMOCRATS WHO WROTE THIS LAW SHOULD HAVE PROOFREAD IT OR AT LEAST NOT HAVE SENT IT FROM THEIR iPHONE. THIS RULING IS JUST THE LATEST IN OUR NATION'S LONG HISTORY OF LEGALLY BINDING TYPOS. WHO REQUEST FORGET THE BRIEF, DANGEROUS PERIOD WHEN AMERICANS ONLY HAD THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR RAMS. (LAUGHTER) BUT-- FOLKS AS CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGINALISTS, ALL CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU MAKE A TYPO, YOU HAVE TO STICK WITH IT I MEAN WHY ELSE WOULD ANYONE NAME THEIR CHILD REINCE PRIEBUS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
