[EAGLE CAW] ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK R- THANKS SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US. FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, PLEASE THANK YOU. HEROS. YOU KNOW, FOLKS -- PLEASE WE'VE  GOT A THING TO DO HERE. I DON'T GROW TIRED OF IT EITHER. [LAUGHTER] NATION, I DONT NEED TO TELL YOU  THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS IN  CRISIS. AND EVER SINCE THEY LOST THE  ELECTION, THE GOP HAS BEEN  FLAILING AROUND FOR ANSWERS. AND NO ONE HAS FLAILED HARDER  THAN REPUBLICAN NATIONAL  COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND UNSOLVED JUMBLE PUZZLE, REINCE PRIEBUS. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, THE SOLUTION TO THAT  JUMBLE? CRISP BEE URINE. [LAUGHTER] LOOK IT UP. LOOK IT UP. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION,  MR. URINE CONVENED A PANEL OF  REPUBLICAN LEADERS CALLED THE "GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY PROJECT"  TO STUDY WHY THEY LOST. OR AS HE PUT IT:
YOU'VE GOT TO DO A FULL  AUTOPSY.
Stephen: YES, A FULL AUTOPSY. [LAUGHTER] IT'S THE NATURAL THING TO DO  WHEN YOU'VE GOT CANDIDATES THIS  COLD AND STIFF. [LAUGHTER] WELL, THE PANEL RELEASED ITS  AUTOPSY LAST WEEK, AND GOOD  NEWS, THERE ARE MULTIPLE CAUSES OF DEATH! [LAUGHTER]
OUR MESSAGE WAS WEAK. OUR GROUND GAME WAS  INSUFFICIENT. WE WEREN'T INCLUSIVE. FOCUS GROUPS DESCRIBED OUR PARTY  AS "NARROW MINDED," "OUT Of  TOUCH," AND "STUFFY OLD MEN." I'M ONLY 41 BY THE WAY. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: YEAH, HE'S ONLY 41! HE'S A STUFFY MIDDLE-AGED MAN! [LAUGHTER] AND WHILE THE AUTOPSY SAYS THAT  REPUBLICANS NEED TO DO A BETTER  JOB OF REACHING OUT TO BLACK PEOPLE, BROWN PEOPLE, AND WOMEN  PEOPLE, NO GROUP IS MORE  IMPORTANT TO THE GOP'S FUTURE SUCCESS THAN YOUNG PEOPLE  PEOPLE. AS THE REPORT LAMENTS MITT  ROMNEY LOST VOTERS YOUNGER THAN  30 BY FIVE MILLION VOTES. FIVE MILLION! WHAT WERE MY FELLOW UNDER  30-YEAR-OLDS THINKING? [LAUGHTER] WELL, HOLD ON TO YOUR BACKWARD  HATS, YOUNG JEE-ZEES, BECAUSE [LAUGHTER] THE AUTOPSY SAYS THAT TO REACH  THE KIDS, THE GOP SHOULD  ESTABLISH A REPUBLICAN CELEBRITY TASK FORCE, AN ELITE SQUAD OF  CONSERVATIVE SUPERSTARS READY TO  DEPLOY AS SOON AS WE ACTIVATE THE CELEBRITY TASK FORCE SIGNAL. [LAUGHTER] [SIREN]
GOP CELEBRITY TASK FORCE  ASSEMBLE! JON VOIGHT! VICTORIA JACKSON! TOM SELLECK! KELSEY GRAMMER! CLIFF CLAVEN! LADY FROM NORTHERN EXPOSURE! [LAUGHTER] AT LEAST ONE BALDWIN! [LAUGHTER] THIS GUY, FROM THAT THING! THE KIDS WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT  THEM BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THEY  KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE. [LAUGHTER] NOW, ON THE SLIM CHANCE THIS  DOESN'T SEAL THE YOUTH VOTE, THE  REPUBLICAN AUTOPSY ALSO SAYS, "REPUBLICAN LEADERS SHOULD  PARTICIPATE IN AND ACTIVELY  PREPARE FOR INTERVIEWS WITH "THE DAILY SHOW" AND "THE COLBERT  REPORT." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHOO! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU HEAR THAT, REPUBLICANS? NOW, I DONT KNOW WHY A  POLITICIAN WOULD WANT TO GO ON  WITH GRANDPA OVER HERE, BUT IF YOU COME ON MY SHOW, YOU WILL  REACH THE YOUTH! OR AS I CALL IT, "YOU'LL GET  YOUTH-ANIZED." [ LAUGHTER ] LISTEN TO YOUR PRIEBUS! THIS STUDIO IS A SAFE ZONE, MI  CASA ES SU CASA-- IS SOMETHING  YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ME SAY. [LAUGHTER] REINCE PRIEBUS, TAKE YOUR OWN  ADVICE: COME ON MY SHOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I GOTTA TELL YOU -- FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M GOING TO BE PICKING THIS OUT  OF MY SKIN ALL NIGHT. AND REINCE PRIEBUS HAS HIS WORK  CUT OUT FOR HIM, BECAUSE  AMERICA'S MORAL FABRIC IS THINNER THAN A PAIR OF LULULEMON  YOGA PANTS. [LAUGHTER] THE GAY SWARM DESCENDED ON THE  SUPREME COURT WHICH TODAY AND  TOMORROW ARE HEARING ARGUMENTS-- NO SURPRISE THEY'RE  ORAL-- IN TWO CASES WHICH WILL  DECIDE WHETHER GAY MARRIAGE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. I SHUDDER TO THINK THE UNNATURAL  COUPLING OF SAME-SEX PARTNERS  MAY BE PUT ON THE SAME LEGAL FOOTING AS MY LOVING  RELATIONSHIP WITH MY GUN. YOU COMPLETE ME. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS THAT? I'LL PUT YOU IN MY HOLSTER. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, IF WE LOSE EITHER OF  THESE CASES, IT IS GAY-MA-GEDDON  AMERICA: LOST IN SEA OF  HEDONISM. IT'S ALREADY STARTED. DON'T BELIEVE ME? BRACE YOURSELF. A DUCK HAS FATHERED A CHICKEN. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS TERRIFYING AND DELICIOUS  NEWS! [LAUGHTER] SORRY, BUT THE BIBLE SAYS,  MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN ONE MAN, AND  THAT MAN'S RIB. NOTHING GAY. [LAUGHTER] BUT TRY TELLING THAT TO THE  SECULAR PROGRESSIVES OUT THERE. SUPPORT FOR GAY MARRIAGE IS  SURGING LIKE RYAN GOSLING IN MY  DREAMS. KNOCK IT OFF! I WILL -- I'M FLATTERED BUT I  DON'T WANT TO SPOT YOU. [LAUGHTER] A RECENT POLL FOUND THAT  58% OF AMERICANS NOW THINK IT  SHOULD BE LEGAL FOR GAYS AND LESBIANS TO GET MARRIED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE OTHER 42% OBJECT ONLY  BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GO TO  ANOTHER GODDAMN WEDDING. [LAUGHTER] THIS TERRIFYING DECAY OF PUBLIC  MORALS BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S  WORD:  NARCI-CITIZENSHIP [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, IF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS  KNEW ABOUT THE ADVANCEMENT OF  THE GAY AGENDA, THEY'D BE SPINNING IN THEIR SILK  PANTALOONS. [LAUGHTER] WHEN THEY WROTE OUR  CONSTITUTION, HOMOSEXUALS  WEREN'T EVEN INVENTED YET. AS JUSTICE ALITO SAID IN COURT  THIS MORNING, GAY MARRIAGE IS  "NEWER THAN CELLPHONES OR THE INTERNET."  YEAH, AND IT WAS 30 YEARS BEFORE  EVERYBODY HAD CELL PHONES. WHAT'S THE HURRY, GAYS? [LAUGHTER] THE PROBLEM IS --  THE PROBLEM IS, THESE DAYS GAYS  ARE EVERYWHERE. 57% OF AMERCANS NOW SAY THAT  THEY HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER OR  CLOSE FRIEND WHO IS GAY. UP 12% SINCE 2007. AND THAT TAKES ITS TOLL. FOR EXAMPLE, OHIO REPUBLICAN  AND REPUBLICAN FROM OHIO ROB  PORTMAN.
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN  SENATOR ROB PORTMAN, WHO HAS  OPPOSED GAY MARRIAGE IN THE PAST, STUNNED WASHINGTON BY  SAYING HE NOW FAVORS IT. HIS REASON, HIS SON HAD TOLD HIM  HE WAS GAY.
Stephen: HE CHANGED HIS MIND  BECAUSE HE HAS A GAY SON WHICH  IS NOT JUST WRONG BUT IT'S  UNDEMOCRATIC. BECAUSE HIS OTHER TWO CHILDREN  ARE STRAIGHT. WHAT HAPPENED TO MAJORITY RULE? [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PORTMAN'S JUST THE LATEST VICTIM  OF THE LONG GAY CON. HERE'S HOW THE SCAM WORKS. FIRST, A GAY PERSON DECIDES TO  GET BORN INTO A CONSERVATIVE  FAMILY, GAINS THEIR TRUST BY LETTING THEM LOVE AND RAISE  THEM, AND THEN 21 SHORT YEARS  LATER-- BOOM!-- THEY SPRING THE GAY TRAP. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO DICK  CHENEY. HIS DAUGHTER MARY CHANGED HIS  MIND ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE BY  TUGGING ON HIS HEARTSTRINGS. NOW, THANKFULLY, SOME  REPUBLICANS ARE HOLDING FAST,  LIKE GEORGIA SENATOR AND NOISE BILL COSBY MAKES WHEN HE GETS  OUT OF A CHAIR SAXBY CHAMBLISS. [LAUGHTER] WHEN ASKED WHETHER ROB PORTMAN'S  FLIP FLOP HAD CHANGED HIS MIND,  CHAMBLISS REPLIED, "I'M NOT GAY. SO I'M NOT GOING TO MARRY ONE." [LAUGHTER] SUCK ON THAT , GAYS. SAXBY CHAMBLISS ISN'T GOING TO  MARRY YOU. ERGO YOU DON'T GET TO MARRY  ANYONE. [LAUGHTER] IT'S THE SAME REASON, I BELIEVE. THIS IS SAME REASON I SAY WE  SHOULD ELIMINATE SOCIAL  SECURITY-- BECAUSE I'M NOT OLD, AND NEVER WILL BE. [LAUGHTER] AND WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT  WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS? I DON'T HAVE A VAGINA. I'VE CHECKED. [LAUGHTER] ALL SAXBY AND I ARE SAYING IS  NOTHING IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR  UNLESS IT'S HAPPENING TO YOU. IF MEMORY SERVES, LINCOLN FREED  THE SLAVES BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK. [LAUGHTER] BUT SENATOR CHAMBLISS ON THE  OTHER HAND IS WHITE  THAT EXPLAINS WHY HE'S AGAINST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. [LAUGHTER] AND HE VOTED AGAINST THE 2009  STIMULUS BILL, BECAUSE HE'S  ALREADY GOT A JOB. [LAUGHTER] AND BY HIS OWN LOGIC, NO  MARRIAGE IS LEGITIMATE EXCEPT  MARRIAGE TO SAXBY CHAXBLISS. [LAUGHTER] SORRY, LADIES. SO MARRIAGE IS SAFE AS LONG AS  SAXBY CHAMBLISS NEVER TURNS GAY. WHICH YOU KNOW, COULD HAPPEN. BECAUSE HE HAS PROVEN HE REALLY  ONLY CARES ABOUT ONE SPECIAL  MAN. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
