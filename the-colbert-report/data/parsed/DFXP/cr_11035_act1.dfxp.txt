(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!") THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE ANSWER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS MORE OF. THAT IS THE SOUND OF FREEDOM. THAT IS THE SOUND OF AMERICA THAT IS THE SOUND OF TRUTH.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YOU-- FOLKS, THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT, FOR THAT WELCOME, BECAUSE TONIGHT, I AM BESIDE MYSELF WITH ANGER AND HE'S MAD, TOO. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE YESTERDAY, SENATE DEMOCRATS DROPPED A TURD OF INFORMATION INTO THE NATIONAL PUNCH BOWL OF BLISS.
EXPLOSIVE REPORT, THE SENATE REVEALS C.I.A. SECRETS ABOUT TORTURING TERROR SUSPECTS.
THE REPORT WRITTEN BY SENATE DEMOCRATS SAYS THE C.I.A. OVERSTATED THE PROGRAM'S SUCCESSES WHILE HIDING ITS HORRORS.
IT IS A DAMNING INDICTMENT.
IT IS DAMNING, INDEED.
Stephen: YES, A DAMNING REPORT ABOUT ENHANCED INTERROGATION. THE PROGRAM WAS STARTED UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH IF YOU RECALL, AND IF YOU DON'T RECALL, THE C.I.A. HAS WAYS TO MAKE YOU. IT'S ALL DETAILED IN THIS 500-PAGE TRAVESTY, WHICH SPILLS SENSITIVE TORTURE SECRETS AND READS LIKE "50 SHADES OF LEGAL GREY AREAS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, YEAH. SPICY STUFF, OH, YEAH. THERE'S A LITTLE BONDAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) JIM?
AMERICAN INTERROGATORS PUNCHED, SHACKLED, DRAGGED AND NEARLY DROWNED AL QAEDA OPERATIVES.
THE SEXUAL HUMILIATION OF PRISONERS, AND EVEN TORTURING DETAINEES AFTER THE C.I.A. DETERMINED THERE WAS NO MORE INFORMATION TO BE GAINED.
DETAINEES WERE KEPT IN TOTAL DARKNESS AND GIVEN BUCKETS FOR HUMAN WASTE.
ABU ZUBAYDAH, A TOP AL QAEDA ASSOCIATE, SPENT A TOTAL OF 266 HOURS IN A LARGE COFFIN-SIZED CONFINEMENT BOX.
AND THIS IS NOT PLEASANT TO RECOUNT, BUT MANY INCIDENCES OF SO-CALLED RECTAL REHYDRATION. ♪ I JUST GOTTA SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE. ♪ SHAKE IT OFF, SHAKE IT OFF. WHOO-HOOO♪♪ SORRY, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GET A PAIR OF THESE TRAGEDY-CANCELLING HEADPHONES. REALLY MAKES IT BETTER. NOW, FOLKS I GOTTA ASK, WHAT IS THE POINT OF TELLING US ALL THIS ROUGH STUFF? NO ONE STILL THINKS THAT IT'S EVER OKAY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
FOR THE RECORD, I STILL THINK IT'S OKAY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS, AS LONG AS IT'S DONE IN A FAIR WAY. I THINK THE TORTURE-- I'M SORRY, THE ENHANCED INTERROGATION TECHNIQUE, I THINK IT SERVES A PURPOSE.
Stephen: ANOTHER, OKAY. SO ERIC IS IN FAVOR OF TORTURE-- I'M SORRY, TORTURE-- IF ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IF-- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT-- IF IT'S DONE IN A FAIR WAY. YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS THEY BRING ENOUGH HUMAN WASTE BUCKETS FOR EVERYONE IN THE SECRET PRISON. I AM WITH FOX'S ANDREA TANTAROS WHO IS STOKED FOR AMERICA COME WHATEVS.
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS AWESOME. WE ARE AWESOME. BUT WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION. WE'VE CLOSED THE BOOK ON IT, AND WE STOPPED DOING IT. AND THE REASON THEY WANT TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT TO SHOW HOW AWESOME WE ARE. THIS ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION TO SHOW US HOW WE'RE NOT AWESOME.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. BUT WE ARE AWESOME, AND WE HAVE TO BE AWESOME, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WE'RE FIGHTING ARE TOTALLY RADICAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THAT'S WHY-- ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHY, THAT'S WHY WE HAD TO RESORT TO EXTREEEME MEASURES. SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY, THINGS GOT PRETTY GNARLY. WE-- WE SHOCKED A BRAU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) NOW BESIDES, ALL OF THIS IS ANCIENT HISTORY.
WE KNOW IT WAS BAD, BUT WHY BRING IT UP NOW?
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE WE'VE BEEN DOING ANY OF THIS. SO THE NEED TO RELEASE THIS DOCUMENT WITH A LOT OF GORY DETAILS AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME IS HARD TO FIND.
WE'RE AT 2014. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN 2006, 2007, SEVEN, EIGHT YEARS AGO.
Stephen: YEAH, IT WAS SEVEN, EIGHT YEARS AGO. THE C.I.A. WAS PROBABLY KEEPING DETAINEES AWAKE BY BLASTING FEIST. COME ON. STILL, THERE ARE SOME BRIGHT SPOTS IN THIS THING AND NOT JUST THE SPARKS OFF THE JUMPER TABLES BECAUSE AMERICA'S FORMER PRESIDENT, AND MY HEART'S FOREVER PRESIDENT, GEORGE W. BUSH, COMES OFF LOOKING GREAT IN THIS THING. FOR EXAMPLE, ON PAGE 98 IT SAYS, "THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAD DIRECTED HE NOT BE INFORMED OF THE LOCATIONS OF THE C.I.A. DETENTION FACILITIES TO ENSURE HE WOULD NOT ACCIDENTALLY DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION." THAT'S RIGHT, NO, THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD. BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL TOO EASY FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ACCIDENTALLY DISCLOSE THIS KIND OF INTEL. I MEAN, IT'S A SIMPLE SLIP-UP ANYBODY COULD MAKE. WHAT YOU MEAN TO SAY IS CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP SAN ANTONIO SPURS BUT WHAT COMES OUT IS WE'RE STICKING DENTAL TOOLS UP SOMEBODY'S PEE HOLE UNDER A BULGARIAN DISCO. THEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN, OF COURSE, YOU HAVE TO SEND TIM DUNCAN TO THE DISCO BECAUSE HE KNOWS TOO MUCH. IT'S A MESS. AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT COURAGE THAT WILLFUL IGNORANCE TAKES. AND IT DATES BACK TO OUR FOUNDING FATHERS. REMEMBER, IT WAS GEORGE WASHINGTON WHO FIRST SAID-- AND I QUOTE-- BLOOOLOOLOOLOOLOO. HE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON EITHER BECAUSE HE WAS TORTURING PEOPLE, TOO. DON'T BELIEVE ME? JUST ASK AMATEUR HISTORIAN AND BROWN-HAIRED GUY WHO'S NOT STEVE DOOCY OR AN HISTORIAN, BRIAN KILMEADE.
WHEN SOMEONE OR SOME GROUP IS TRYING TO DESTROY YOU AND YOUR WAY OF LIFE, YOU NEED TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO STOP THEM.
GEORGE WASHINGTON DID, AND THAT'S A FACT. SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SAY THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE BUILT ON, WE DON'T BEAT THE BRITISH WITHOUT DOING IT.
Stephen: YEAH, WASHINGTON TORTURED THE BRITISH SO HARD, THEY'RE STILL TALKING FUNNY.   ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) YEAH. THAT'S HOW WE DID IT. NOW, WE LOOKED IT UP, AND IN ACTUALITY, WASHINGTON DIDN'T TORTURE THEM. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE DIDN'T. BECAUSE WHILE THE C.I.A. WAS CONDUCTING AN ALL-YOU-CAN-PUMP RECTAL-HYDRATION FESTIVAL, HERE'S WHAT GEORGE BUSH SAID.
THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT TORTURE.
Stephen: AND HE SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE HE SPECIFICALLY ASKED NOT TO BE TOLD. NOW, ANOTHER PERSON WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE TOLD THINGS IS WOLF BLITZER, WHO YESTERDAY BLITZED DIANNE FEINSTEIN, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE COMMIT THEY RELEASED THIS REPORT.
WAS IT WORTH IT TO RELEASE THIS REPORT TODAY IF IN FACT AMERICAN LIVES, DIPLOMATS, MILITARY PERSONNEL, CIVILIANS ARE GOING TO BE IN DANGER?
LOOK, THERE IS NO PERFECT TIME TO RELEASE THIS REPORT. THERE HAVE BEEN BEHEADINGS. THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS WITHOUT THIS REPORT COMING OUT.
BUT IF AMERICANS ARE KILLED AS A RESULT OF THIS REPORT AND THEY TELL YOU THAT, I ASSUME YOU WOULD FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THAT.
I WOULD FEEL VERY BADLY, OF COURSE. I MEAN WHAT, DO YOU THINK, WOLF BLITZER? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YES. WHAT DO YOU THINK, WOLF ISAAC BLITZER. AND DON'T YOU ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME, YOUNG MAN. NOW GO CLEAN YOUR SITUATION ROOM OR YOUR FATHER AND I WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR BEARD TRIMMER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I NEVER, IN ALL MY YEARS-- FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YOU, I'M WITH WOLF BLITZER ON THIS ONE. AS JOURNALISTS IT IS OUR SACRED DUTY TO FACE THOSE IN AUTHORITY AND ASK SHOULD WE REALLY KNOW THIS? THE POINT IS I DON'T WANT TO LEARN WHAT'S IN THIS REPORT. WHEN WE RETURN, I'M GOING TO LEARN WHAT'S IN THIS REPORT WHEN I'M JOINED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ARCHIVE AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, TOM BLANTON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
