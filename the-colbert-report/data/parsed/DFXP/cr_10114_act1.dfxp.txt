TONIGHT: CONTROVERSY ROCKS FOOTBALL. TURNS OUT SOME OF  THE PLAYERS IN THE PUPPY BOWL WERE FIXED. THEN, A NEW OBAMA SCANDAL, THIS TIME HE TRADED FIVE TALIBAN MEMBERS FOR SOME STRING CHEESE AND A PUDDING PACK. AND MY GUEST ROCK LEGEND CHRISSIE HYNDE HAS A NEW ALBUM CALLED "STOCKHOLM." I WON'T LIKE IT AT FIRST, BUT THEN I'LL GROW TO LOVE AND IDENTIFY WITH IT. A STUDY FOUND SMOKING MARIJUANA CAN MAKE MEN INFERTILE,  SO REMEMBER: IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX GET HIGH FIRST. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (AUDIENCE CHANTS "STEPHEN!")
Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I'M NOT SURPRISED-- FOLKS. I JOIN YOU IN YOUR CELEBRATION. I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS IS  COMING FROM. I KNOW WHERE THAT GOOD FEELING IS ROOTED. BECAUSE, NATION, ONCE AGAIN, IF YOU READ THE PAPERS,YOU KNOW THAT ONCE AGAIN, IT IS A GREAT DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY IN THAT   IT IS A TERRIBLE DAY FOR BARACK OBAMA. HE IS FACING A FIRESTORM OF CRITICISM AFTER TRADING FIVE HIGH-LEVEL TALIBAN FIGHTERS FOR CAPTURED ARMY SGT BOWE BERGDAHL. IT'S A SCANDAL SOME ARE CALLING BERGDGHAZI. SO FAR, IT'S JUST ME, BUT IT'S GOING TO CATCH ON. ON TUESDAY, AT THE G7 SUMMIT IN POLAND, THE PRESIDENT DEFENDED HIS ACTIONS.
LET ME JUST MAKE A VERY SIMPLE POINT HERE, AND THAT IS REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES, WHATEVER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY TURN OUT TO BE, WE STILL GET AN AMERICAN SOLDIER BACK IF HE'S HELD IN CAPTIVITY. PERIOD. FULL STOP.
Stephen:  YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT. COMMA. OR CAN YOU. QUESTION MARK. BECAUSE OF COURSE, WE WANT TO GET EVERY AMERICAN SOLDIER BACK. BUT DO WE WANT TO GET EVERY AMERICAN SOLDIER BACK? BECAUSE THE TV HAS SOME QUESTIONS.
IS HE AN AMERICAN HERO OR A DESERTER?
A MEMBER OF HIS PLATOON SAYS BERGDAHL LEFT HIS OWN POST ON HIS OWN VOLITION, BACK IN 2009.
SHORTLY BEFORE HE WALKED OFF THE BASE HE WROTE TO HIS PARENTS ABOUT HIS DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE MILITARY AND HIS MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN.
HEAR THAT? THIS GUY HAD GROWN DISILLUSIONED WITH THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WORD FOR THAT: 82% OF AMERICANS. PLUS, SHOULD WE BE BRINGING THIS GUY BACK WHEN SEVERAL OF THOSE WHO SERVED WITH BERGDAHL CHARGED THAT SOLDIERS DIED SEARCHING FOR HIM? AND I AGREE WITH ANYONE WHO SAYS THE BEST WAY TO HONOR THEIR SACRIFICE IS TO NEVER COMPLETE THEIR MISSION. AND NOW, WE'RE ALSO LEARNING THAT BERGDAHL HAS A HISTORY OF UN-AMERICAN BEHAVIOR DATING BACK TO HIS CHILDHOOD IN SUN VALLEY, IDAHO.
WELL, HE APPARENTLY WAS INTO BALLET.
AT THE AGE OF 16, HE STARTED TAKING BALLET LESSONS AT A LOCAL STUDIO.
I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL TODAY THAT HE TOOK BALLET. HOW LONG DID HE DO THAT?
HE STARTED TAKING BALLET WHEN HE WAS ABOUT 17 AND CONTINUED TAKING IT UNTIL HE WAS 22, 23.
Stephen:  YES, LONG BEFORE BERGDAHL'S TIME WITH THE TALIBAN MILITIA, HE SPENT YEARS IN THE HANDS OF ANOTHER RADICAL GROUP, THE SUGARPLUM FAIRIES. AND FOX NEWS' DR. KEITH ABLOW KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS WHEN A MAN DOES BALLET.
THE FACT THAT HE WAS A DANCER AND A LIFTER-- NOT A WEIGHTLIFTER, BUT HE WOULD I GUESS LIFT UP--
THE BALLERINA.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
I THINK FRONT AND CENTER ON ANY STAGE IS THIS GUY'S M.O., UNLESS IT DOESN'T FEED HIM NARCISSISTICALLY. YOU CAN'T GIVE HIM A JOB UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO TELL HIM YOU'RE THE STAR AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP YOU AT A THROTTLE OF 12 OUT OF 10.
Stephen:  THAT'S WHY HE WAS DISILLUSIONED WITH THE MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN-- IT LACKED THE FULL-THROTTLE INTENSITY OF THE SUN VALLEY, IDAHO BALLET SCHOOL. JUST TO RECAP-- DESERTER. ENDANGERED SOLDIERS' LIVES. SKIPPED AROUND IN TIGHTS. AAAAAND... I'M FORGETTING SOMETHING.
THE FATHER WITH THE BEARD.
Stephen:  DAD, BEARD. DAD BEARD. BAD DAD. BAGHDAD. COINCIDENCE THAT IT'S A DIFFERENT COUNTRY? METHINKS HE DOTH BEARD TOO MUCH. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY AS INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE WHICH IS HOPEFULLY NEVER BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I'M IN THE SWEET SPOT BETWEEN COMPLETE IGNORANCE AND RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION. IT'S PRETTY GREAT. FOLKS, THE NEW YORK TIMES IS NOW REPORTING THAT THERE WERE FIXED SOCCER MATCHES LEADING UP TO THE 2010 WORLD CUP,  BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT SOCCER IS FIXED BECAUSE NOTHING CAN FIX THAT GAME. THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FIRST NEXT, WHEN IT COMES TO INTERNATIONAL SPORT NO ONE  TAKES IT  MORE SERIOUSLY THAN OUR ENEMIES IN NORTH KOREA. TO THEM, EVERY GAME IS "THE HUNGER GAMES." AND NOW, THEIR ATHLETES COULD BECOME KIM JONG UN-BEATABLE.
A NEW SPORTS DRINK IS CLAIMING TO ENHANCE PHYSICAL ABILITY AND SPEED RECOVERY AND IT'S ALL DUE TO THE MIRACLE INGREDIENT-- MUSHROOM FUNGUS.
NORTH KOREAN SCIENTISTS SAY THE DRINK IS VERY EFFECTIVE.
Stephen:  YES, NORTH KOREA HAS DEVELOPED A MUSHROOM-BASED SPORTS DRINK, WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE FIRST-EVER INSTALLMENT OF SPORT REPORT - SPORE REPORT. WHERE ATHLETES-- ( APPLAUSE ) WHERE ATHLETES AND FUNGUS COME TOGETHER AND FOR ONCE, NOT IN THEIR JOCKS. ACCORDING TO THE KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, D.P.R.K. SCIENTISTS HAVE "SUCCEEDED IN FINDING THE WAY TO CULTIVATE MUSHROOM FUNGUS AND MADE A FUNCTIONAL DRINK. THIS NATURAL DRINK IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN ENHANCING  PHYSICAL ABILITIES OF SPORTS PERSONS AND RECOVERING FROM THEIR FATIGUES." ENHANCING SPORTS PERSONS AND RECOVERING FROM FATIGUES. THAT IS A ONE-TWO PUNCHING WE CAN'T BE OF COMPETITION TOWARDS. NEED MORE PROOF NORTH KOREA IS SHII-TAKING THIS  MUSHROOM PROGRAM SERIOUSLY? LOOK AT THIS PHOTO OF KIM JONG-UN. IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE THE MUSHROOMS END AND HIS HAIRCUT BEGINS. NOW LUCKILY FOR US, ONE AMERICAN COMPANY ALREADY HAS A POTENT MUSHROOM-BASED SPORTS DRINK-- IT'S CAMPBELL'S. THEIR CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP REALLY HELPS REPLENISH YOUR BODY'S NATURAL SOUPS. CAMPBELL'S, IF YOU'RE SMART, YOU'LL RENAME THIS THIRST QUENCHER, CAMPBELL'S NEW SPORT-O-BELLOW. THAT SMELLS LIKE VICTORY, AND A LITTLE LIKE A FRESHLY DUG GRAVE. SECOND NEXT UP, FOLKS, I LOVE FOOTBALL. I D.V.R. EVERY GAME, AND SO DO THE PLAYERS BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. THAT'S WHY I'M SO DISGUSTED BY THE BETRAYAL CURRENTLY PLAYING OUT IN THE NFL WHERE OVER 500 FORMER PLAYERS HAVE JOINED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE LEAGUE THAT MADE THEM FAMOUS AND DRUG ADDICTED INVALIDS.  A NEW LAWSUIT ALLEGES NFL TEAMS AND THEIR DOCTORS KNOWINGLY GAVE PLAYERS AN ARRAY OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND PAIN KILLERS FOR YEARS AND YEARS WITHOUT ANY REGARD FOR THE LONG-TERM DAMAGE.
FORMER FOOTBALL PLAYERS BY THE HUNDREDS CLAIM THE LEAGUE ILLEGALLY DRUGGED THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY COULD STAY IN THE GAME. IN MANY CASES DID NOT EVEN TELL THEM WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM.
OUR PLAYERS WERE SHOT UP LIKE CATTLE. THEY WERE BROUGHT TO MARKET, AND THEN DISCARDED LIKE PIECES OF MEAT.
Stephen:  WHAT AN EXAGGERATION. AMERICA'S CATTLE ARE GIVEN FAR FEWER DRUGS. AND OH, WHAT WONDERFUL PAIN KILLING DRUGS THEY WERE. IT WAS LIKE WILLY WONKA AND THE EVER-LASTING THROB STUFFERS. NOT ONLY DID YOU HAVE PERCODAN, PERCOCET, VICODIN, BUT ALSO AMBIEN. SO IF YOU EVER THOUGHT THE JETS LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE ASLEEP OUT THERE, YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT REALLY SADDENS ME-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HUGE FANS OF THE JETS OR NARCOTICS OUT HERE TONIGHT. WHAT REALLY SADDENS ME, FOLKS, IS THREE OF THE PLAINTIFFS ARE MEMBERS OF MY BELOVED 1985 SUPER BOWL CHAMPION CHICAGO BEARS WHO I SHOULD'VE KNOWN WERE JACKED ON SOMETHING WHEN THEY MADE THIS.
(RAPPING) WE'RE NOT HERE TO START NO TROUBLE.  WE'RE JUST HERE TO DO THE SUPER BOWL SHUFFLE
Stephen:  HOW COULD YOU SUE THE NFL? YOU GAVE YOUR WORD YOU WEREN'T HERE TO START NO TROUBLE. NEXT, FINALLY, THE OLYMPICS. FOLKS, THE SUMMER GAMES ARE JUST TWO YEARS AWAY IN RIO DE JANEIRO, THE PERFECT CITY TO CARRY ON THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRST OLYMPICS BECAUSE EVERYONE THERE IS ALREADY OILED UP AND NAKED. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, FOLKS, EXCITEMENT IS BUILDING IN RIO. IN FACT, THAT MIGHT BE THE ONLY THING THAT'S BUILDING.
HOST CITY RIO DE JANEIRO IS SO FAR BEHIND IN ITS PREPARATIONS.
THE PROJECT IS FACING UNPRECEDENTED DELAYS.
ROADS GOING NOWHERE, UNFINISHED STANDS. AND AN AWFUL LOT OF CONSTRUCTION WORK STILL TO DO.
THE TOP OLYMPICS OFFICIAL IS SLAMMING PREPARATIONS FOR THE 2016 GAMES IN RIO, CALLING THEM THE WORST HE'S EXPERIENCED IN NEARLY 40 YEARS.
Stephen:  THE WORST EVER EXPERIENCED. AND THAT IS SAYING SOMETHING BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL SOME OLYMPIC ATHLETES TRAPPED IN THEIR SOCHI HOTEL BATHROOMS. BUT, FOLKS, THERE IS ONE EVENT THAT WILL BE MORE AFFECTED BY THE DELAYS THAN ANY OTHER-- SAILING. BECAUSE RIO'S GUANABARA BAY IS SO FILLED WITH RAW SEWAGE AND GARBAGE, THAT ONE SAILOR'S DINGHY CRASHED INTO WHAT HE BELIEVED WAS A PARTLY SUBMERGED SOFA. AND ANOTHER ONE ENCOUNTERED HUMAN CORPSES ON FOUR OCCASIONS WHILE SAILING IN THE BAY. FOUR CORPSES, FOLKS. THAT'S BAD. THE SOFA ONLY HOLDS THREE. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
