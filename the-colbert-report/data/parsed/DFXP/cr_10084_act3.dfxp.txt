(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW FILM ABOUT CESAR CHAVEZ. WHAT CRAZY THING WILL HOLLYWOOD THINK OF NEXT? PLEASE WELCOME JOHN MALKOVICH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT, SIR. YOU'RE A HOLLYWOOD ROYALTY -- OSCAR NOMINEE, EMMY WINNER -- YOU'RE CLEARLY A LIBERAL, RIGHT? YOU'RE A LIBERAL, RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: GOATEE GIVES YOU A WAY.
IT'S MERELY A SOUL PATCH.
Stephen: IT KIND OF IS AND JUXTAPOSES NICELY WITH THE SUIT MADE OF SKY YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU TODAY. I HAVE TO SAY THE FRIENDLINESS OF THE SUIT MAKES THIS PART MUCH SCARIER, ALL RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) OKAY. WHY ARE YOU PLAYING THE HERO IN THE MOVIE ABOUT LABOR ORGANIZER CAESAR CHAVEZ?
THE HERO?
Stephen: YEAH, BECAUSE YOU'RE THE RANCH OWNER, YOU'RE THE JOB CREATOR, YOU'RE THE FRIEND OF RICHARD NIXON. YOU'RE THE HERO OF THE MOVIE TRYING TO STOP THE LABOR ORGANIZERS FROM SUCCEEDING. WHY PLAY HERO FOR ONCE? YOU'RE USUALLY THE BAD GUY.
YEAH, I MEAN, IT HAPPENS, YEAH.
Stephen: YEAH. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO THINK OF SOMEONE WHO CAN  CALL RICHARD NIXON ON THE PHONE AS A HERO.
Stephen: I AGREE -- A LITTLE BIT.
BUT I'M NOT SURE I WOULD CLASSIFY AS HEROIC SOMEONE WHO SIMPLY DOESN'T WANT TO PAY ANYBODY A LIVING WAGE.
Stephen: OKAY, YEAH. BUT WHAT THE MARKET WILL BEAR, OKAY... THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET SAYS YOU PAY PEOPLE AS LITTLE AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN SO YOU CAN MAKE MORE MONEY AND PAY THEM. OKAY? (APPLAUSE) MAYBE WE SHOULD EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE THE STORY. I KNOW THE STORY OF CAESAR CHAVEZ BECAUSE I WORKED WITH THESE LOONS OVER IN THE UNITED FARM WORKERS ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO. TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT CHAVEZ TRIED TO DO TO THE GOOD GRAPE GROWERS OF CALIFORNIA.
WELL, HE TRIED TO ORGANIZE THE UNION, TO PAY PEOPLE AT LEAST SOMETHING APPROACHING A DOESN'T DAY'S PAY FOR A DECENT DAY'S WORK --? MM-HMM. WHO GETS TO SAY WHAT THAT IS? CAESAR CHAVEZ.
SURE. AND THINGS LIKE MAYBE GIVE THEM A PLACE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
Stephen: IT'S A FIELD, FOR GOD'S SAKE (LAUGHTER) IT'S A FIELD.
OKAY.
Stephen: WE HAVE A LITTLE CLIP HERE. JIMMY, ROLL THE CLIP.
WHO THE HELL IS THIS CASAR CHAVEZ?
NOBODY KNOWS. SOMEBODY SAY HE'S FROM ARIZONA. WORD IS HE USED TO HANG AROUND THE OTHER COUNTIES FROM C.S.O. IN THE VALLEY STIRRING UP TROUBLE. I HEARD HE'S MEXICAN. SEEMS A SAFE BET.
Stephen: NOW, CHAVEZ HAD A MOTTO -- (SPANISH) -- IT MEANS "YES, WE CAN." OBAMA STOLE THAT FROM HIM AND DIDN'T PAY HIM ANY ROYALTIES, AS FAR AS I COULD TELL. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) A, ISN'T THAT UNION BUSTING IN AND OF ITSELF? AND, B, WHAT DO YOU THINK OBAMA'S GOALS AND CHAVEZ'S GOALS, OR THESE EARLY UNION GOALS, WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON?
WELL, FIRST, I WOULD SAY THAT OBAMA MAYBE COULD HAVE USED A DIFFERENT PHRASE, SUCH AS "IF YOU LIKE YOUR LETTUCE, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR LETTUCE." GRANTED, I MEAN, PROBABLY HE SHOULD HAVE PAID FOR IT. BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S A QUESTIONABLE -- LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY -- IF THE WORLD WERE DIFFERENT, AND IF EVERYBODY HERE'S POSITION WAS REVERSED, AND WE HAD TO CROSS A MEXICAN BORDER TO FIND WORK, DON'T YOU THINK IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF SIMPLE FAIRNESS THAT, IF YOU WORK LIKE THEY DO -- LIKE DOGS IN THE BLAZING SUN ALL THE TIME -- THAT YOU MAKE ENOUGH TO EAT AND CLOTHE A FAMILY AND EDUCATE A FAMILY? (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT YOUR LETTUCE, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR LETTUCE -- CHAVEZ -- THERE WASN'T ENOUGH FOR THEM TO JUST GET A LIVING WAGE. THEY HAD TO DENY US OUR LETTUCE. BECAUSE IN THE '70s --
BUT ONLY --
Stephen: NO, THERE WAS A LETTUCE SHORTAGE. WILL YOU ADMIT THERE WAS A LETTUCE SHORTAGE IN THE 1970s? WILL YOU ADMIT IT, YES OR NO, SENATOR?
I WILL ONLY SAY THIS, THEY DIDN'T BOYCOTT BIB OR ICEBERG LETTUCE. WHY SHOULD WE CARE? IT WAS ONLY THINGS LIKE ARUGULA (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU'RE RIGHT. I APOLOGIZE. I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SUIT. DID YOU DESIGN THAT?
I DID.
Stephen: YOU HAVE YOUR OWN CLOTHING LINE.
I DO.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT CALLED? TECHNO-BOHEMIAN.
Stephen: CAN I SMELL LIKE MALKOVICH, IF I WANT?
I DON'T THINK YOU'D WANT.
Stephen: NO? A LITTLE MALKOVICH?
NO, I DON'T HAVE A FRAGRANCE?
Stephen: YOU DON'T? WOULD BIT OKAY IF I SMELLED YOU?
SURE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LIKE A BABY'S BOTTOM. JOHN MALKOVICH! THE MOVIE IS CESAR CHAVEZ, IN THEATERS NOW!
