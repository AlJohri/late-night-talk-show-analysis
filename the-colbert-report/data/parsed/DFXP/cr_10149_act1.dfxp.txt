(EAGLE CAW)
STEPHEN: TONIGHT, THE LATEST NEWS ON IMMIGRATION REFORM. (SILENCE). THERE, YOU'RE ALL CAUGHT UP. THEN, A NEW TECHNOLOGY HELPS YOU STAY FIT. JUST SIT RIGHT THERE ON THE COUCH TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS. (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST, JOHN LITHGOW IS ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED LITH-GO. (LAUGHTER) OLIVE GARDEN IS INTRODUCING A $100 ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT PASTA PASS THAT LASTS SEVEN WEEKS. THOUGH, TECHNICALLY THE LAST TWO WEEKS ARE FOR YOUR NEXT OF KIN. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪     CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY     COMEDY CENTRAL (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
STEPHEN: THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! THAT IS MY NAME! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I THINK IF YOU GUYS WEREN'T OUT THERE CHANTING MY NAME EVERY NIGHT, I'M NOT SURE I WOULD KNOW WHO I WAS. (CHEERING) FOLKS, YOU WATCH THIS SHOW. YOU KNOW THAT AS A PATRIOT, THERE IS NOTHING I LOVE MORE THAN CELEBRATING THE OVERTHROW OF THE BRITISH MONARCHY AND TELLING KING GEORGE WHERE HE CAN STICK HIS CRUMPET! AND AS AN IRISH AMERICAN WHOSE ANCESTORS WERE DRIVEN WEST OF THE RIVER SHANNON TO FARM ROCKS, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BUCKINGHAM PALACE TURNED INTO A PUBLIC URINAL FOR THE INDIGENT AND THE INSANE. (LAUGHTER) BUT ON THE OTHER HAND --
ANOTHER ROYAL BABY IS ON THE WAY.
ANOTHER ROYAL BABY IS ON THE WAY.
WE HAVE A SPARE TO THE HEIR.
THE HEIR AND THE SPARE.
IT'S AN HEIR AND A SPARE.
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOD! AN HEIR AND SPARE! AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I CARE! BUT I DO! WE DID IT! WELL, TECHNICALLY WILL AND KATE DID IT. (LAUGHTER) SO MAGICAL. IT'S A FAIRYTALE. THE ROYALS ARE TRULY A SPECIAL CLASS OF PEOPLE -- THEY MANAGED TO HAVE SEX WITH A ONE-YEAR-OLD IN THE HOUSE! (LAUGHTER) AND I WANT TO THANK THE HAPPY COUPLE, BECAUSE THIS COULD NOT HAVE COME AT A BETTER TIME.
EBOLA, ISIS, SO MANY HORRIBLE STORIES GOING ON RIGHT NOW BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE NEWS ALL ABOUT SICKNESS AND TERROR AND DEATH. LET'S CELEBRATE LIFE.
IN THE INTEREST OF NOT ALL NEWS BEING NEGATIVE, A BIG ROYAL ANNOUNCEMENT.
SO MANY FOLKS HAVE BEEN BUMMED OUT BY SOME DEPRESSING NEWS. WE BROUGHT YOU A PREGNANCY. THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS NEED. JUST SOME HAPPY BABY NEWS.
STEPHEN: YEAH, SOME HAPPY NEWS! HAPPY NEWS THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO PASS OUT CIGARS, RATHER THAN SIMPLY PASS OUT. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, IT'S NOT ALL GOOD NEWS. BECAUSE "KATE IS SUFFERING FROM AN ACUTE FORM OF MORNING SICKNESS" THAT FORCED THE ROYALS "TO ANNOUNCE THE PREGNANCY BEFORE THE DUCHESS PASSED THE SIGNIFICANT 12-WEEK MILESTONE." YES, THE MORNING-SICKNESS SPECULATION. WOULD HAVE BEEN RAMPANT -- IS SHE PREGNANT, OR DID SHE JUST EAT ENGLISH FOOD? (LAUGHTER) SO THANK YOU, PRINCE WILLIAM AND DUCHESS KATE, FOR GIVING THE WHOLE WORLD A MUCH-NEEDED BREAK FROM THE WHOLE WORLD. (LAUGHTER) YOU DESERVE EVERY BIT OF THE ATTENTION YOU'RE GETTING. INSTEAD OF ME. WHICH LEADS TO MY OWN ANNOUNCEMENT -- I'M PREGNANT! (CHEERING) I PEED ON THAT STICK LAST NIGHT (CHEERING) I PEED ON THAT STICK LAST NIGHT AND IT GOT WET, SO I THINK THAT MEANS THIS IS A GO. I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR ALONG I AM, BUT JUDGING BY THE SCALE, MY BABY ALREADY WEIGHS EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT AS LAST NIGHT'S  CHIPOTLE. NATION, EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK AMERICA IS BEING INFILTRATED BY LOS LATINOS IMMIGRANTES. IN FACT, DID YOU KNOW THAT EVEN THIS SENTENCE STARTED WITH AN UPSIDE-DOWN QUESTION MARK? THANKFULLY, HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO COMBAT THIS MENACE BY DOING NOTHING. BUT BACK IN JUNE, THE PRESIDENT THREATENED TO UNDO EVERYTHING THEY HAVE NEVER DONE.
SO, WHILE I WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO DROP THE EXCUSES AND ACT, AMERICA CANNOT WAIT FOREVER FOR THEM TO ACT. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: NO, THEY'RE WAITING FOREVER -- FOR YOU TO TALK.
THAT'S WHY TODAY -- I'M BEGINNING A NEW EFFORT TO FIX AS MUCH OF OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AS I CAN ON MY OWN -- WITHOUT CONGRESS.
STEPHEN: GOING IT ALONE? THAT COMPLETELY UNDERMINES OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF CHECKS, BALANCES, AND CRIPPLING DEADLOCKS. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE MY RELIEF WHEN I SAW OUR WAFFLER-IN-CHIEF FOLD LIKE A BREAKFAST TACO. (LAUGHTER) JIM?
PRESIDENT OBAMA HITTING THE PAUSE BUTTON ON IMMIGRATION REFORM.
THE PRESIDENT NOW HOLDING OFF ON ANY ACTION TO FIX THE IMMIGRATION CRISIS UNTIL AFTER THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.
I WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME EVEN AS WE'RE GETTING ALL OF OUR DUCKS IN A ROW FOR THE EXECUTIVE ACTION, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE T'S ARE CROSSED AND THE I'S ARE DOTTED.
STEPHEN: YES, HE JUST WANTS TO CROSS THE T'S, DOT THE I'S, AND TILDE THE N'S. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: NATURALLY, THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION HAS LEFT HISPANIC SUPPORTERS ASKING, SEÑOR OBAMA, DONDE ESTAN LOS COJONES? (LAUGHTER) AS ONE LATINA ACTIVIST SAID, "A GUY SAYS HE'S GOING TO PROPOSE, AND THEN HE DECIDES HE'S GOING TO DELAY AND NOT PROPOSE FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS. SO YOU GO, 'O.K., I WANT A TWO-CARAT RING NOW INSTEAD OF A ONE-CARAT RING." ONE CARAT, TWO CARAT. WE DON'T WANT TO GET MARRIED. WE JUST WANT SOMEONE TO PICK OUR CARROTS. (LAUGHTER) AND I'M MAD THAT OBAMA IS DELAYING IMMIGRATION REFORM BECAUSE HE STOLE THAT IDEA FROM THE REPUBLICANS! THEY'VE HAD THE IDEA OF PUTTING OFF DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IMMIGRATION REFORM FOR A DECADE!
THE POINT IS THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO, MOVE FORWARD WITH IMMIGRATION REFORM.
WE'VE GOT TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM PLAN.
WE'VE GOT SOME PLANS TO UNVEIL SOME CHANGES TO THE LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM OF THIS COUNTRY.
WE'RE GOING TO RELEASE A DOCUMENT SOON ABOUT OUR WAY FORWARD ON IMMIGRATION.
WE'RE OPEN TO LOOKING AT IMMIGRATION REFORM.
IMMIGRATION REFORM WILL BE MY TOP PRIORITY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ADDRESS A FEDERAL ISSUE FROM A FEDERAL STANDPOINT.
LET US HAVE A SERIOUS, CIVIL AND CONCLUSIVE DEBATE SO THAT YOU CAN PASS AND I CAN SIGN COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM INTO LAW.
THE DEBATE OVER IMMIGRATION REFORM HAS REACHED A TIME OF DECISION.
WE MUST PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM.
IMMIGRATION REFORM IS A VERY IMPORTANT AGENDA ITEM.
STEPHEN: YES, A MUY IMPORTANTE "AGENDA" ITEM. THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T DO PASS IMMIGRATION REFORM. THAT WOULD TAKE IT "OFF" THE AGENDA. BUT DON'T LOSE HOPE, IMMIGRANTS, JUST BECAUSE OUR LEADERS ARE TELLING YOU TO WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T HAPPEN, AS LONG AS YOU JUST WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR. (LAUGHTER) RIGHT, JOHN BOEHNER, FROM LAST WEEK?
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT CONGRESS COULD TAKE THIS ISSUE UP NEXT YEAR.
STEPHEN: NEXT YEAR! GUARANTEED! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NEXT YEAR, GUARANTEED THAT IT'S A POSSIBILITY. AND BOEHNER GETS THE IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE HE REMEMBERS HOW MANY YEARS IT TOOK CONGRESS TO WELCOME HIS COMMUNITY OF TANGELO-AMERICANS. (LAUGHTER) BUT IF FOR SOME REASON THIS LATEST PROMISE ISN'T ENOUGH TO CONVINCE THE HISPANISH COMMUNITY, I SAY WE DO SOMETHING MORE REALISTIC THAN TRYING TO PASS IMMIGRATION REFORM -- BUILD A TIME MACHINE. THAT WAY, PEOPLE FROM THE FUTURE CAN COME BACK AND ASSURE US PRESENT DAY AMERICANS THAT IMMIGRATION REFORM DOES  EVENTUALLY HAPPEN. WITH THAT IN MIND, JOINING ME NOW, LIVE FROM  THE DISTANT TOMORROW, PLEASE WELCOME. FUTURE STEPHEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GREETINGS FROM THE YEAR 2372, STEPHEN.
WOW. YOU LOOK GREAT. ALL MY MOISTURIZING. PAID OFF! FUTURE ME, CAN YOU ASSURE HISPANIC. AMERICANS THAT WASHINGTON EVENTUALLY DOES ADDRESS IMMIGRATION REFORM?
YES, I CAN. IN FACT, EVERYONE IN MY TIME SPEAKS FUTURE-SPANISH -- DONDE ESTA LA SPACE BIBLIOTECA.
INCREDIBLE. SO IN THE FUTURE, IMMIGRATION REFORM WILL BE PASSED?
ABSOLUTELY. NEXT YEAR.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU, FUTURE STEPHEN!
GOODBYE PAST STEPHEN. BET EVERYTHING ON  THE CLEVELAND BROWNS!
STEPHEN: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
