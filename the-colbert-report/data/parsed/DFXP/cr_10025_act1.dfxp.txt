Stephen: TONIGHT, THE PRESIDENT DOES DAMAGE CONTROL ON OBAMACARE. IF YOU LIKE YOUR BURST APPENDIX, YOU CAN KEEP IT. (LAUGHTER) THEN SCANDAL SURROUNDS A POPULAR CLOTHING LINE. APPARENTLY SPANX IS NOT AN INVITATION. AND MY GUEST, STEVE McQUEEN IS DIRECTOR OF THE FILM "12 YEARS A SLAVE." IT'S THE HARROWING STORY OF A NON-SUPERHERO MOVIE BEING MADE IN HOLLYWOOD. (LAUGHTER) BUTTERBALL WARNS THERE MAY BE A TURKEY SHORTAGE. APPARENTLY THEY WERE CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY THIS WHOLE THANKSGIVING THING. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."

Stephen: NOT BAD, NOT BAD! WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. FOLKS, TONIGHT -- FOLKS, THANK YOU. I -- I THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONORING OF ME TONIGHT BUT, FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU -- PLEASE, SIT DOWN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AS MUCH -- FOLKS, AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU PRAISING ME, TONIGHT I HAVE TO START WITH A PRAISE FOR YOU, THE COLBERT NATION. BECAUSE LAST WEEK, FOLKS, I CALLED OUT CHINA FOR DONATING A MEASLY $100,000 IN CASH TO TYPHOON VICTIMS IN THE PHILIPPINES. EVIDENTLY CHINA CAN'T RELATE TO STORM DAMAGE BECAUSE THEIR AIR IS TOO THICK TO ACTUALLY MOVE. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I WAS SO UPSET THAT I CALLED ON YOU, THE NATION, TO OUTDO CHINA BY TEXTING "COLBERT" TO 50555 TO DONATE $10 TO CONVOY OF HOPE, PHILIPPINES RELIEF EFFORT. AND THOUSANDS OF TEXTS POURED IN-- AS DID ONE OR TWO SEX -TS. (LAUGHTER) INAPPROPRIATE BUT APPRECIATED. AND SINCE THURSDAY AT MIDNIGHT, YOU HAVE RAISED-- BRACE YOURSELVES-- A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT IS -- HOLD ON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S MORE THAN $100,000. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, YOU DID IT. EAT IT, CHINA. EAT IT WITH CHOPSTICKS! (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I SAY CHINA IS OUT AND THE COLBERT NATION NOW GETS YOUR SLOT AS WORLD SUPERPOWER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO TONIGHT I AM NOT ONLY LEADER OF THE COLBERT NATION BUT ALSO THE CHAIRMAN. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) AND, FOLKS, THESE ARE MY DEMANDS. ONE: I WANT A SEAT AT THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL. IN FACT, MAKE IT A RECLINE WE ARE CUB HOLDERS SO I CAN WATCH MY STORIES WHILE SOME JAGOFF FROM URUGUAY KEEPS YAKKING. NEXT, I DEMAND CHINA'S MOST-FAVORED NATION'S TRADING STATUS. THAT WILL HELP THE BOTTOM LINE ONCE I FORCE MY AUDIENCE TO MAKE IPADS. (LAUGHTER) LASTLY, I DEMAND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RESPECT MY RIGHT TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING THE COLBERT NATION'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM. (LAUGHTER) IT IS FOR ENERGY! EVEN THOUGH I HAVE PLEDGED TO WIPE VERMONT OFF THE MAP. WE WILL DRIVE YOU INTO LAKE CHAMPLAIN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, LIKE ALL OF YOU, I HAVE ENJOYED WATCHING OBAMA'S SIGNATURE PIECE OF LEGISLATION UNRAVEL LIKE A LOOSE BURRITO IN A BACKPACK. (LAUGHTER) I DO NOT THINK THERE HAS BEEN A TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHEN A PRESIDENT GOT THIS UNPOPULAR THIS FAST-- OTHER THAN THAT ONE TIME.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PREDICAMENT HAS PROMPTED COMPARISONS WITH WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS AT THIS POINT IN HIS PRESIDENCY AND THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE KATRINA.
IS THIS OBAMA'S POLITICAL KATRINA?
Stephen: YES, IT'S EXACTLY LIKE KATRINA BUT, OF COURSE, THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN'T SAY TO PRESIDENT OBAMA!
BROWNIE, YOU'RE DOING A HECK OF A JOB. (AUDIENCE REACTS). (LAUGHTER) OH, OH, OH, THAT IS JUST WRONG. BECAUSE HE'S NOT DOING A HECK OF A JOB. THE POINT IS, OBAMA COULDN'T MAKE HEALTH CARE WORK, SO HIS LEGACY IS NOW SET-- BAD AT USING TECHNOLOGY TO EXTEND LIFE, GOOD AT USING TECHNOLOGY TO END IT. (AUDIENCE REACTS) AND THIS FAILURE GOES BEYOND THE WEB SITE, FOLKS. REMEMBER, THE PRESIDENT REPEATEDLY SAID "IF YOU LIKE YOUR PLAN, YOU CAN KEEP IT." BUT NOW MILLIONS OF PLANS ARE BEING CANCELED. SO LAST WEEK, THE PRESIDENT HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. JIM?
OH, THE HUMANITY!
Stephen: NO, NO, NO! JIM, NO, WRONG DISASTER. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK CNN'S THE DON LEMON PUT OBAMA'S PUBLIC IMPLOSION INTO THE PROPER PERSPECTIVE.
YOU WON'T FIND TWO POLITICIANS WHO'VE HAD WORSE WEEKS THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD. THEY'VE HAD A PRETTY BAD WEEK. (AUDIENCE REACTS) PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYING SORRY OVER AND OVER FOR HIS SO-CALLED SIGNATURE ACHIEVEMENT, OBAMACARE, ROB FORD ADMITTING TO BE A CRACK SMOKER. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Stephen: YES, OBAMA IS IN THE SAME TIGHT SPOT AS TORONTO'S CRACK-SMOKING MAYOR. I MEAN, THE PARALLELS ARE EVERYWHERE, FOLKS. BOTH HAD PRESS CONFERENCES-- AND THAT'S IT. (LAUGHTER) BUT, FOLKS, COMPARING THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT TO THE FIRST BLACKOUT MAYOR ISN'T UNFAIR. IT'S NOT UNFAIR AT ALL BECAUSE LEMON MADE SURE TO ASK SEVERAL TIMES WHETHER IT WAS UNFAIR OR NOT.
IS IT FAIR, THOUGH, TO COMPARE THE TWO CRISES?
NO, IT'S NOT FAIR TO COMPARE THEM AT ALL. THEY'RE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
I'LL ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION. IS IT FAIR TO COMPARE THE TWO CRISES? BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT DAMAGE CONTROL NOT WHETHER THE TWO CRISES ARE EQUIVALENT.
EXACTLY AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO MAKE A COMPARISON FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT BOTH OF THEM ARE IN TROUBLE.
Stephen: YEAH, THEY'RE BOTH IN TROUBLE. THEREFORE, IT'S AN ENTIRELY FAIR COMPARISON. THE SAME WAY THAT SINCE THEY'RE BOTH ON VIDEO, IT'S FAIR TO COMPARE DON LEMON'S REPORTING TO THIS DOG MILKING A GOAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, I'VE GOT TO SAY, CHUCK TODD LOOKS GREAT IN THAT HAT. AND THIS FAILURE TO LAUNCH IS THE END OF MORE THAN JUST OBAMACARE, FOLKS. JIM, BRING DOWN THE KRAUTHAMMER.
WE HAVE NOT JUST OBAMACARE UNRAVELING, NOT JUST THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION UNRAVELING, NOT JUST THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY OF THE SENATE, BUT WE COULD BE LOOKING AT THE COLLAPSE OF AMERICAN LIBERALISM.
Stephen: YOU NAILED IT COUNT CHUCKULA. (LAUGHTER) OBAMACARE'S FAILURE MEANS LIBERALISM IS DEAD! I CAN SEE IT JUST AS CLEARLY AS IF I'M ABOUT TO DO IT AT ANOTHER CAMERA. (LAUGHTER) JUST GOT BACK FROM THE SOCIAL JUSTICE RALLY WHICH I ATTENDED BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN ALL CITIZENS' SHARED RESPONSIBILITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, CLASS, CREED OR ORIENTATION. WAIT, WHAT'S THIS? I CAN'T LOG ON TO OBAMACARE? BURN THE GAYS! BURN THEM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, I WAS JUST DOING THAT (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, I WAS JUST DOING THAT IN CHARACTER. YES, NATION, THINGS ARE GOING PRETTY WELL FOR CONSERVATIVES AND WE'VE HANDLED THIS SUDDEN GOOD FORTUNE WITH OUR TRADEMARK GRACE AND HUMILITY.
ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN OBAMACARE STOPS BEING THIS ABSTRACTION, YOU KNOW, AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE A DISASTER AND I THINK THAT CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS GET TO GLOAT A LITTLE AND SAY "WE TOLD YOU SO."
FOR ME I'LL SIT BACK AND TRY TO REFRAIN FROM SAYING "WE TOLD YOU SO."
HATE TO SAY WE TOLD YOU SO.
WELL, WE TOLD YOU SO.
WE HATE TO SAY WE TOLD YOU SO BUT QUITE HONESTLY WE ALL LOOK LIKE GENIUSES NOW. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SHE'S RIGHT! THE OBAMACARE ROLLOUT IS SO BAD THAT BY COMPARISON MICHELE BACHMANN IS A GENIUS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND IF A SELF-CERTIFIED GENIUS LIKE BACHMANN WAS RIGHT ABOUT OBAMACARE SHE MUST HAVE BEEN RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!
THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS A BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR ENTITY. THEY WANT TO BECOME THE LENS CRAFTER OF BIG ABORTION.
Stephen: BRILLIANT!
THE VERY FOUNDERS THAT WROTE THOSE DOCUMENTS WORKED TIRELESSLY UNTIL SLAVERY WAS NO MORE IN THE UNITED STATES. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Stephen: WHAT ELSE YOU GOT, EINSTEIN?
THERE ISN'T EVEN ONE STUDY THAT CAN BE PRODUCED THAT SHOWS THAT CARBON DIOXIDE IS A HARMFUL GAS. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: GENIUS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S A CHEAP HIGH. (LAUGHTER) BOTTOM LINE, WE WERE RIGHT ABOUT OBAMACARE, THEREFORE WE WERE RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING. HE WAS BORN IN KENYA. HE'S A SECRET MUSLIM. AND WE SHOULD HAVE ELECTED -- WHAT? NO! JIM, NO! THAT'S BETTER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
