( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, YOU KNOW THAT STEPHEN COLBERT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE FAN OF ADVERTISING. I ONLY WISH COMMERCIALS WEREN'T CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTED BY LONG STRETCHES OF CHARACTERS AND STORIES. WHO CARES WHO MURDER WHO? I JUST WANT TO SEE TWO DIFFERENT PAPER TOWELS ABSORB THINGS. ( LAUGHTER ) IS THAT ALL WE HAVE? ALL RIGHT. THAT'S WHY ON MY SHOW I PROMOTE PRODUCTS WHENEVER I CAN, FROM WHEAT THINS TO DORITOS, TO LIBERIAN CONFLICT DIAMONDS. SHE WON'T BE THE ONLY ONE WHO SHED A TEAR OVER THAT ENGAGEMENT RING. SO-- YEAH, OOOOH! SO WHENEVER THERE'S A NEW INNOVATION IN ADVERTISING, I TAKE NOTICE, FOLKS. AND I WAS TRULY IMPRESSED BY THE GENIUS OF THIS RECENT AD FROM THE GOOD FOLKS AT CHEERIOS.
MOM. DID DAD EVER GIVE YOU CHEERIOS WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE KID?
YEAH, SHE DID CHEERIOS HAS PRETTY MUCH BEEN FOREVER.
WHEN WE HAVE CHEERIOS IT'S KIND OF LIKE WE'RE HAVING BREAKFAST WITHNAN NANA.
YEAH. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  OH, NANA! ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  OH, NANA! ( APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, THE BEST IDEAS ALWAYS SEEM-- ( LAUGHTER ) SO OBVIOUS IN HINDSIGHT, YET SOMEHOW NOBODY THOUGHT TO LEVERAGE THE DEATH OF A GRANDPARENT TO HAWK SOME HOOCH OF OATES. I USED TO EAT SEAR WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE LONG LINES OF LOVED ONE WHO SHUFFLED OFF THIS MORTAL COIL LEAVING ME TO FACE MY MARCH TO ABLIFFION ALONE, WEIGHED DOWN BY THE CHAINS OF THE PAST. IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I ATE WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE PANCAKES. NOW I CAN'T WALK DOWN A CEREAL AISLE WITHOUT ENTERING A HAUPTED HOUSE OF LOSS AND REGRETS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) CLEAN UP IN AISLE HERE. BUT, FOLKS, AS IMPRESSED AS I AM WITH THE WORK OF SOUL-RENDING MARKETING YEENS, IT ALSO WAS CAUSE FOR ALARM BECAUSE APPARENTLY CHEERIOS ARE HAUNTED BY THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) PIMEAN, YOU HEARD THAT KID. WHEN YOU EAT CHEERIOS THE DEPART ROAM YOUR BREAKFAST NOOK. THEY'RE A PORTAL BETWEEN OUR WORLD AND THE PURRATORY. BE GONE FROM MY MILKY BOWL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I MEAN, FOLKS THE WARNING-- THE WARNING SIGNS WERE ALWAYS THERE. HOW DID WE NEVER NOTICE THAT A BOWL FULL OF CHEERIOS SPELLS OOOO-OOOO. THE CHEERIOS NOW JOINS THE RANKS OF UNDEAD ENDORSED CEREALS LIKE COUNT CHOCULA. BOOYAKASHA. FIBERATU THROUGH A ROUGH ANNUAL OF HORROR. AND CHITHU-LOOPS. CHITHU-LOOPS, THE FRUIT FLAVORS ARE TOO HORRID FOR THE HUMAN
