WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, I AM... I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY STONE-COLD FURIOUS ABOUT YESTERDAY'S HEATED REPUBLICAN SENATE PRIMARY IN MISSISSIPPI, WHICH PITTED TEA PARTY CHALLENGER AND SHORT-HAIRED SEVERUS SNAPE CHRIS McDANIEL AGAINST INCUMBENT SENATOR AND MAN IN REVERSE MORTGAGE AD  THAD COCHRAN. I SAY IT IS TIME FOR COCHRAN TO GO. HE'S A BIG GOVERNMENT WASHINGTON INSIDER FAMOUS FOR CHANNELING FEDERAL CASH TO HIS STATE.
HE GOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR MISSISSIPPI AND THE MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST AFTER KATRINA.
NO ONE BRINGS HOME MORE BACON TO HIS STATE THAN THAD COCHRAN.
HE'S ABOUT BRINGING HOME THE BACON.
BRINGING HOME THE BACON.
HIS CALLING CARD IS THAT HE BRINGS HOME THE PORK.
Stephen: HE BRINGS HOME THE PORK AND THE BACON. THOUGH, TO BE FAIR, TO BE FAIR, HOG MEAT IS MISSISSIPPI'S OFFICIAL STATE CURRENCY. THE POINT IS... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE POINT IS, THAD COCHRAN IS PLAYING THE DIRTY POLITICS OF PROMISING PEOPLE STUFF AND THEN DELIVERING IT. BUT NOT CHRIS McDANIEL. HE'S SO AGAINST FEDERAL SPENDING THAT HE TOLD A CROWD AT OLE MISS, I'M NOT GOING DO ANYTHING FOR YOU. I'M GOING TO GET THE GOVERNMENT OFF YOUR BACK. THEN I'M GOING TO LET YOU DO IT FOR YOURSELF. THUS STANDING BY HIS OLD CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, McDANIEL 2014, YOU'LL GET NOTHING AND YOU'LL LIKE IT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WELL, FOLKS, I'M SAD TO SAY THE RESULTS ARE IN AND COCHRAN WON 50.9% TO 49.1%. FEW THINGS ARE EVER THAT CLOSE IN MISSISSIPPI OTHER THAN THE GENOMES OF MARRIED COUPLES. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] BUT IT'S NOT JUST... IT'S NOT JUST THAT COCHRAN WON. IT'S HOW HE WON.
THAD COCHRAN SAID, LOOK, STRATEGICALLY I HAVE TO WIN OVER BLACKS AND UNION MEMBERS. THAT'S WHO HE WENT AFTER. EVIDENTLY THEY SHOWED UP.
THE CONGRESSMAN REACHED OUT THE VOTERS BEYOND HIS  CONSERVATIVE BASE, INCLUDING BLACKS.
IT'S UNREAL THE LEVEL OF BLACK TURNOUT IN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY YESTERDAY.
IS THIS THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, YOU BRAG ABOUT YOUR BIG-SPENDING WAYS TO THE VOTERS AND YOU RELY ON THE SUPPORT OF BLACK LIBERAL DEMOCRATS TO GET YOU ELECTED?
STEPHEN: HE APPEALED TO BLACK PEOPLE. THAT'S INCREDIBLY SELFISH. DOESN'T THAD COCHRAN KNOW THERE'S NO "I" IN MISSISSIPPI. AND THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT, FOLKS. COCHRAN MADE A DEAL WITH THE DEVILCRATS, WHO TEAMED WITH THE MISSISSIPPI CONSERVATIVE PAC TO DO GET OUT THE VOTE WORK AND RALLY AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS. THOSE DEMOCRATS, BISHOP RONNIE CRUDUP, SR., AND JAMES SCOOBY-DOO WARREN. RUT ROH! AND, FOLKS, I'M TELLING YOU, AND McDANIELS WOULD HAVE WON THIS RACE, TOO IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU MEDDLING KIDS. [LAUGHTER] I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING SAY IS, WHEN DID BLACK PEOPLE START VOTING? WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL SIT DOWN WITH ONE OF THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR BLACK PEOPLE VOTING IN MISSISSIPPI, REPRESENTATIVE ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
