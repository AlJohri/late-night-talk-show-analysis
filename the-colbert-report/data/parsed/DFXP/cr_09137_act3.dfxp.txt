Stephen: I LIVED IT, WHAT  ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, NO, I  HAVE NOT READ IT, I HAVE NOT READ IT. I HAVE NOT READ IT. SO DO YOU SEE YOURSELF AS AN  IRISH AUTHOR OR AMERICAN  AUTHOR BECAUSE ARE YOU AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

THAT'S ME RUNNING DOWN  5th AVENUE.
Stephen: REALLY, DO YOU  HAVE YOUR PANTS ON.
I DO OCCASIONALLY. I THINK YOU CAN CELEBRATE IT,  THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF  AMATEUR DAY ABOUT ST. PATRICK'S DAY WHEN THEY ARE  OUT AND ABOUT AND RUNNING  DOWN THIRD AVENUE AND MAKING A BIT OF FOOL OF THEMSELVES. BUT PART OF IT IS OKAY, JUST  GO OUT AND ENJOY YOURSELF RZ.
Stephen: BY AMATEUR YOU  MEAN THEY DON'T DO IT WELL.
THEY DON'T DO IT WELL.
Stephen: THEY DON'T DO  WELL.
ALL THE AMATEUR DRINKERS  ARE OUT. THEY ARE SORT OF DECORATING  THE PAVEMENTS IN UNUSUAL  WAYS.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. NO, I UNDERSTAND YOU WRITE  YOUR BOOKS IN A VERY  INTERESTING WAY. THAT YOU WRITE IT IN A  CLOSET.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: YOUR OFFICE IS A  TINY LITTLE THING QLCHLT SO  TINY?
YOU KNOW, I WAS BUILDING  A DESK ABOUT A YEAR AND A  HALF AGO WITH A FRIEND OF MINE, A CARPENTER, GEORGE. AND I WAS BUILDING THE DESK  AROUND A CUPBOARD AND I SAID  JUST BUILD THE DESK INTO THE CUPBOARD AND THEN I NOTICED  THAT IT WAS A PERFECT PLACE  TO SIT. SO I'VE BEEN IN 9 CLOSET NOW  FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. AND IT IS QUITE A FINE PLACE  TO BE TO BE IN THE CLOSET. MY WIFE KNOWS THIS AN MY  KIDS KNOW THIS.
Stephen: THAT'S VERY  UNDERSTANDING OF THEM.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW YOU SAID  THAT YOU REALLY FOUND THE  POWER, FOUND THE ABILITY TO FIND THE STORIES YOU WANTED  TO AFTER YOU CAME TO THE  UNITED STATES.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT, COME  TOGETHER UNITED STATES, YOU  JUST CAME HERE, YOU RODE YOUR BIKE AROUND THE UNITED  STATES WHERE DID YOU GO.
I ENDED UP IN BOSTON FOR  A WHILE FERNING I WAS A TAXI  DRIVER IN HYANNIS FOR A  WHILE. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO  GET TO ANYPLACE. I JUST ASKED THE PEOPLE, I  SAY WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO  THEY SAY 26-- I WILL BE  DELIGHTED TO TAKE YOU THERE. TELL ME HOW TO GET THERE. AND SO THEN-- .
Stephen: AND THEY STAYED  IN THE CAR THNS THEY STAYED  IN THE CAR AND THEN I TOOK A BICYCLE JOURNEY FOR 12,000  MILES GETTING LOST EVERY  SINGLE DAY. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL THING. I WENT FROM BOSTON TO  FLORIDA, ACROSS TO TEXAS,  INTO NEW ORLEANS, DOWN INTO  MEXICO, EVENTUALLY FINISHED UP COMING ACROSS THE GOLDEN  GATE BRIDGE. AND WITH SO MANY STORIES  THIS IS THE THING. EVERYBODY HAD A STORY TO  TELL. THIS WAS THE BEAUTIFUL THING  ABOUT AMERICA TOO. PEOPLE WERE OPEN AND  GRACIOUS AND KIND. I DIDN'T SLEEP ONE SINGLE  NIGHT IN A HOTEL. I EITHER CAMPED OUT IN A  FOREST OR BY THE RIVER OR  PEOPLE INVITED ME INTO THEIR  HOMES. AND IT WAS JUST SORT OF  FANTASTIC.
Stephen: IT IS THE ACCENT  YOU REALIZE, IT IS  DISARMING. IT'S A LEPRECHAUN WHAT CAN  POSSIBLY DO TO US. (APPLAUSE)
I KNOW.
Stephen: WELL, COLUM  McCANN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
