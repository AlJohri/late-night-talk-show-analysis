[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT SAY REPORTER  WHO HAS WRITTEN A NEW BOOK  DETROIT AN AMERICAN AUTOPSY I BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS  AUTO EXOTIC IMPORTATION. PLEASE BELL COME CHARLIE LEDUFF. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CHARLIE, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK. IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS. NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW  BOOK CALLED "DETROIT:  AN  AMERICAN AUTOPSY."  WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF DEATH? WHAT DID THE COURNEAUER FIND?
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WHITE FLIGHT, BLACK FLIGHT,  BUSINESS FLIGHT WE EVEN HAVE  DEAD FLIGHT.
Stephen: DEAD PEOPLE WILL  NOT STAY IN DETROIT? [LAUGHTER]
PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN DETROIT  WHO LIVE OUT IN THE SUBURBS AND  ARE AFRAID OF IT, ABOUT 1200 IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THEY'VE GONE  AND GOT GRANDMA SCHIEWMED HER  AND BROUGHT -- EXHUMED HER AND BROUGHT HER TO THE SUBURBS TO  VISIT HER.
Stephen: BECAUSE THEY  DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO DETROIT.
THEY WERE AFRAID.
Stephen: YOU WERE AWAY FROM  15 YEARS, RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU GO  BACK TO DETROIT?
I CHANGED. I WAS THE BIG SHOT NORKTS --  "NEW YORK TIMES" GUY.
Stephen: RIGHT PULITZER  PRIZE IN YOUR POCKET.
HIS A KIDFUL. IT CHANGES EVERYTHING. I LOOK AT IT LIKE THIS IS WHAT  WE'RE GIVING OUR KIDS. WE HAVE TO FIX WITH. WE MOVED HOME TO BE WITH  GRANDMA, AUNTS AND UMPG. S. MY WIFE IS FROM THERE AS WELL. I LOOK AND SAY TO MY PEOPLE,  WHAT DO YOU DO HERE?
Stephen: WHAT DID THEY DO? THERE WERE 8.5 MILLION AT ONE  POINT AND NOW THERE'S 700,000  AND CHANGE.
IN THE 50s MORE PEOPLE LEFT  THEN THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME. THE SUBURBS WERE GROWING AND THE  MECCA CAN CALL COTTON PICKERS. WE NEVER HAD TO ADDRESS RACIAL  ISSUES.
Stephen: THE WHITE PEOPLE  WERE THE ON THE OUTSIDE.
IT WAS LEGAL TO BAR JEWS AND  BLACKS FROM NEIGHBORHOODS UNTIL  THE 1950'S UNTIL MICHIGAN. IN THE NORTH THEY NEVER TAUGHT  US THAT.
Stephen: I'M FROM THE  SOUTH. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE  RACISTS.
RIGHT ON, BROTHER.
Stephen: BUT OBAMA SAVED  THE AUTO INDUSTRY, RIGHT? IT'S BOOMING, AMERICA IS BACK  THIS IS THE SECOND HALF SAID  CLINTESTWOOD IN THE AMERICAN IS  STORY. HALFTIME IN THE AMERICAN STORY. WHY ISN'T DETROIT BOOMING IF THE  AUTO INDUSTRY IS BOOMING?
WE ALL KNOW IT. THE COMPANY IS BOOMING. WE SHAVED THE DEBT, THE  CREDITORS TAKE A BATH THEY NOW  MAKE PROFIT BUT THE JOBS ARE NOT HERE ANYMORE. THEY ARE SOME PLACE WAY OVER  THERE.
Stephen: ROMNEY WAS RIGHT  THE JEEP JOBS WERE SHIPPED TO  DHN.
CHINA, MEXICO, TAIWAN, YOU  NAME IT. THEY ARE NOT COMING BACK. THE POINT OF BOOK AN AMERICAN  AUTOPSY YOU BETTER LOOK AT  DETROIT BECAUSE THAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF  MONEY. WE'RE SCARED TO DEATH OF WHAT  THEY ARE DOING IN WASHINGTON. PRINTING BEGUN SPENDING NOT  SPENDING. SEQUESTRATION. GET THE MONEY TOGETHER OR THE  KIDS DON'T HAVE A FUTURE. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Stephen: OKAY HE WAS  BROUGHT IN AS AN EMERGENCY  MANAGER TO FIX THE PLACE. HE IS NOT ELECTED.
HE IS NOT ELECTED TAKING OVER  THE BOOKS.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT LIKE TO  LIVE NOT IN A DEMOCRACY ANYMORE?
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY. THAT'S THE BEEF BUT, LOOK, IT'S  BETTER THAN LIVING IN HELL. GET THE MONEY TOGETHER. THE FEDS HAVE COME IN AND HELPED  US WITH THE POLITICAL  CORRUPTION.
Stephen: IS IT CORRUPT?
THE SOMEWHERE GOING TOLL  FEDERAL PRISON.
Stephen: ILLINOIS HAS HAD  GOVERNORS THAT GO TO PRISON.
WE'RE NOT ONLY ONES THAT IS  RIGHT. IN SAN DIEGO.
Stephen: MAYBE YOU ARE NOT  CORRUPT ENOUGH BECAUSE SOME OF  THESE OTHER CITIES, HEY WHAT THE MARKET WILL BEAR. YOU GET THE GOVERNMENT YOU PAY  FOR. YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING.
TOTALLY TRUE. [ LAUGHTER ] TONY JEFFERSON?
Stephen: THE SOMEWHERE  GOING TO JAIL.
GOING TO THE CAN.
Stephen: HAS THIS GUY GOT A  CHANCE TO PULL IT TOGETHER?
WE HOPE. THE F.B.I. STRAIGHTENS UP OUR  POLITICAL CORRUPTION. THE EM GUY HOPEFULLY STRAIGHTENS  UP THE BOOKS. THE CAR COMPANIES ARE STRAIGHT. WE HAVE TRADE WITH CANADA, ALL  THE WATER.
Stephen: TRADE WEAPON  CANADA?
ONE-QUARTER OF A TRILLION IN  TRADE WITH CANADA COMES OVER THE  BRIDGE IN DETROIT. THAT'S OUR FUTURE. ASK YOURSELF ATLANTA,  BIRLINGHAM, STOCKTON, PHOENIX,  WHAT IS YOUR FUTURE?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. WHY BECAUSE YOU THINK THOSE ARE  THE NEXT CITIES?
ASK THE PEOPLE IN  PHILADELPHIA? ASK THEM IN HARRISBURG,  BALTIMORE. THIS IS THE GREAT SWATH OF  AMERICA. I'M SCARED.
Stephen: IF PAST STORIES  YOU COVERED THE WAR IN IRAQ,  CROSSED THE DESERT WITH MIGRANT MEXICANS, YOU BECAME A TRAP  PEASE CLOWN IN A TRAVELING  CIRCUMSTANCE SOCIAL SECURITY OF IMMIGRANTS IS MOVING BACK TO  DETROIT AS IT GOES DOWN THE  TUBES A STUNT? ARE YOU LIKE SET ME ON FIRE AND  PUSH ME OFF A CLIFF? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I ACTUALLY WAS GOING TO RUN  FOR MAYOR AND THEN I REALIZED  YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO DO THE JOB AND THE TIME FOR STUNTS ARE  OVER. TIME FOR ELECT THE PEOPLE ON A  NAME ARE OVER. WE HAVE TO GET HIP, EDUCATE  OURSELVES AND START COMING  TOGETHER AND DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE WHOLE -- YOU KNOW, NO  MAN IS AN ISLAND. IF ONE IS PERISHED IF A CHILD IS  HURT WE'RE ALL DIMINISHED  SOMEHOW. DO YOU FEEL ME?
Stephen: I DO. I FEEL YOU, MAN. I FEEL YOU RIGHT HERE.
NO ONE IS LISTENING. I WOKE MY WIFE UP AT 6:00 A.M. AND SAID BABE, I'M ANGRY AGAIN,  TALK ME DOWN.
Stephen: REALLY? WHAT DOES SHE DO TO TALK YOU  DOWN? I WOULD LOVE TO BE TALKED DOWN. I'M ANGRY ALL THE TIME. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE SHOW?
YEAH.
Stephen: I'M LIKE EYE  NUTRIENT BATH OF RAGE. HOW DID YOUR WIFE TALK YOU DOWN?
SHE SAYS IT'S OKAY NO GO DOWN  AND MAKE THE COFFEE.
Stephen: AND THEN GO TO  WORK.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WELL GO, TO WORK.
THANK YOU.
