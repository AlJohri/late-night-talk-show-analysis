[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST IS A SENIOR EDITOR AT  "SLATE" MAGAZINE WHO'S GOT A NEW  BOOK ABOUT BULLYING. IT'D BE A GREAT TO THROW AT  SOMEONE  PLEASE WELCOME EMILY BAZELON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOUS FOR COMING BACK.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: AS I SAID OVER  THERE YOU ARE SENIOR EDITOR OF  "SLATE" MAGAZINE. I LISTEN TO SLATE GAB FESTS ON  FRIDAYS. VERY RELAXING TO ME. I LISTEN TO YOU.
WE'RE SO GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
Stephen: I'VE BEEN  LISTENING YOU TO YOU TALK ABOUT  THE THIS BOOK ON THE GAB FEST IT'S CALLED "STICKS AND STONES:   DEFEATING THE CULTURE OF  BULLYING AND REDISCOVERING THE POWER OF 'EM PATHY AND  CHARACTER."  WHAT IS 'EM PATHY?
IT'S PUTTING YOURSELF IN  SOMEONE'S SHOES AND IMAGINING TO  BE SOMEONE ELSE AND HAVE THEIR  STRUGGLES.
Stephen: LIKE WHAT?
LIKE GROWING UP WITHOUT  ENOUGH MONEY OR FEELRY REALLY  LEFT OUT, FEELING SOCIALLY AWKWARD LIKE YOU DON'T BELONG.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT  HAVE TO DO WITH BULLYING? BULLIES DON'T DO THAT?
ONE OF BIG PROBLEMS WITH  BULLIES IS THEY SORT OF FREEZE  THEIR OWN FEELINGS OF 'EM PATHY AND THEY ARE NOT GOOD ADD  IMAGINING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE  THE PERSON HAVING THE PAIN INFLICTED ON THEM.
Stephen: IT'S ALSO CALLED A  SOCIOPATH.
THAT'S TRUE BUT LUCKILY IT'S  RARE. A SOCIOPATH IS SOMEONE WHO CAN  NEVER FEEL 'EM PATHY AND BE  COMPLETELY COLD FOREVER.
Stephen: LIKE TUCKER  CARLSON. [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT LUCKILY THAT ALMOST NEVER  HAPPENS.
Stephen: WHEN I SAW THE  BOOK, I REATD IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GUIDE ON HOW  TO BULLY. [LAUGHTER] BUT YOU ARE TALKING A LOT IN  HERE ABOUT SORT OF HOW -- HOW WE  APPROACH BULLYING IN THIS. LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT  HOW YOU PERSONALLY APPROACH  BULLYING. WERE YOU BULLIED YOURSELF?
HIS A MOMENT IN EIGHTH GRADE  WHERE MY FRIENDS ESSENTIALLY ALL  DUMPED ME. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE MY  FRIENDS ANYMORE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU? WHAT DID YOU DO?
I WAS REALLY MISERABLE. I WENT HOME AND CRIED A LOT.
Stephen: NO, WHAT DID YOU  DO TO MAKE THEM DUMP YOU? YOU HAD TO DO LOSE. CAUSE AND EFFECT? WERE YOU A LOSER?
I THINK I WAS. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORRY  BEING WHAT I HAD DONE WRONG AND  PICKING MYSELF APART. THE THING ABOUT BEING BULLIED IS  IT SHREDS YOUR SELF WORTH.
Stephen: YOU WENT HOME AND  CRIED.
I WENT HOME AND CRIED AND  FOUND ANOTHER GIRL IN MY CLASS  WHO WAS FIRED BY HER GROUP OF  FRIENDS. WE KIND OF AS COLOSERS GOT  TOGETHER.
Stephen: YOU STOOD UP FOR  EACH OTHER.
ACTUALLY I DIDN'T DO THAT FOR  HER. IT'S A BIG REGRET THAT I WRITE  ABOUT IN THE BOOK. THE GIRLS MEAN TO THIS FRIEND OF  MINE HAD A LOT OF SOCIAL POWER. THEY TORMENT HER. THERE WAS THIS ONE PARTICULAR  MOMENT IN THE SCHOOL LUNCH ROOM  WHERE THE SPOTLIGHT WAS SHOT SHOWN ON THE FRIEND OF MINE IN A  CRUEL AND PUBLIC WAY BECAUSE I  DIDN'T DO -- AND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP HER. WHAT I DID -- WHERE WHY I WROTE  THE BOOK, IS HOW TO MAKE KIDS  RESPOND BETTER THAN I DO.
Stephen: THIS IS WHY YOUR  FRIENDS DUMPED YOU. YOU ARE CLEARLY A TERRIBLE  FRIEND. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
MOST OF CONFLICT IS TWO WAY  MUTUAL KIDS FIGHTING. THEY CALL IT DRAWMA. IT'S A USEFUL WORD. BULLYING THE OFFICIAL DEFINITION  IS VERBAL OR PHYSICAL ABUSE OR  HARASSMENT REPEATED OVER TIME AND INVOLVES A POWER IMBALANCE.
Stephen: OFFICIAL FROM  WEBSTERS OR THE GOVERNMENT  DEPARTMENT OF BULLY SOMETHING IN WHAT DO YOU MEAN OFFICIAL?
FROM ACADEMICS WHO STUDY. THIS THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED WHAT  I THINK OF AS THE FIELD OF  BULLYING STUDIES WHICH SAY REAL FIELD OF STUDY.
Stephen: SHOULD THERE BE? IF WE'RE MAKING TOO MUCH OF  BULLYING SHOULD THERE BE A  DEPARTMENT AT YALE? ARE YOU SAYING WE DON'T THINK  ENOUGH OR TOO MUCH?
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO  USE THE LABEL FAIRLY. WE NEED MORE RESEARCHERS  THINKING ABOUT HOW TO PREVENT IT  AND HOW TO HELP SCHOOLS AND WHOLE COMMUNITIES, FAMILIES  SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK I'M A  BULLY?
I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT. [ LAUGHTER ] I ANY SOMETIMES -- [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: IT'S OKAY. WHATEVER THE ANSWER IS.
I THINK SOMETIMES YOU BULLY  PEOPLE BUT I DON'T THINK YOU ARE  ALWAYS A BULLY. AND YOUR GUESTS. WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH POWER AS  YOU, RIGHT? UH-OH. SORRY. YOU ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN US. YOU ARE A BIG POWERFUL TV HOST,  RIGHT?
Stephen: YES.
YOU ALMOST NEVER MAKE THAT  FACE. REALLY. YOU ARE ALWAYS IN CONTROL AND  WE'RE THE ONES WHO ARE -- WE'RE  THE ONES WHO ARE MORE AT YOUR MERCY USUALLY. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT NOW I'M --
Stephen: I HATE YOU. I HATE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] I HATE YOU.
SORRY. BUT YOU ARE NOT A BULLY BECAUSE  YOU COULD CHANGE. AND ALSO BECAUSE WE'RE HERE  OBVIOUSLY IT'S OUR CHOICE TO BE  HERE.
Stephen: IT IS YOUR CHOICE. IT'S SOMETIMES LIKE THE NERD'S  FAULT.
NO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. EMILY BAZELON, "STICKS AND  STONES."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
