[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS,  AS I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE STORY  UNFOLD IN THE NEWS, AMERICA'S FLEET OF DRONES HAS  SEMI-AUTONOMOUSLY PILOTED ITS  WAY INTO MY HEART BECAUSE IT  WORKS. [LAUGHTER] LAST WEEK, SENATOR LINDSEY  GRAHAM REVEALED THAT DRONES HAVE  NOW KILLED 4,700 PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. IF FANS HERE TONIGHT. AND MOST IMPRESSIVELY, MANY OF  THOSE 4,700 PEOPLE WERE THE ONES  WE WERE TRYING TO KILL. [LAUGHTER] UNFORTUNATELY, NOT EVERYONE IS  AS PROUD OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S  DRONE PROGRAM AS I AM. FOR INSTANCE, PRESIDENT OBAMA. [LAUGHTER] JUST LISTEN TO FORMER PRESS  SECRETARY, ROBERT GIBBS.
WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE  PROCESS OF BECOMING PRESS  SECRETARY, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY TOLD ME WAS  YOU'RE NOT EVEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE  THE DRONE PROGRAM. YOU'RE NOT EVEN TO DISCUSS THAT  IT EXISTS.
Stephen: THOUGH, TRUTH IS,  THE SECRET GOT OUT A LONG TIME  AGO. I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT IT WAS  LEAKED TO AT LEAST 4,700 PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER] I JUST DON'T GET WHY THE  ADMINISTRATION IS SO ASHAMED OF  ITS EXTRAJUDICIAL  ROBOSASSINATION SPREE. [LAUGHTER] AFTER ALL, A WHOPPING 83% OF  AMERICANS APPROVE OF IT. EVEN AMONG LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 77%  ENDORSE THE USE OF DRONES. AND THOSE REMAINING 23% OF  LIBERAL HOLDOUTS ARE JUST THE  SAME SPOILSPORTS WHO EVENTUALLY RUINED THE IRAQ WAR, THE  JAPANESE INTERNMENT CAMPS, AND  THE 1902 LAW PERMITTING THE IRISH TO BE CATAPULTED INTO THE  SEA. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY DON'T THESE LIBERAL  PEACE-HUMPERS GET HOW SUCCESSFUL  OUR DRONES HAVE BEEN? I MEAN, OVER IN PAKISTAN DRONE  STRIKES HAVE MADE TRAVEL TO THE  TRIBAL AREAS SO PERILOUS FOR WESTERN AL QAEDA RECRUITS, THAT  TERRORISTS ARE ACTIVELY  DISSUADED FROM MAKING THE TRIP. THUS CANCELLING THIS YEAR'S  MTV'S "SPRING BREAK:  WAZIRISTAN." [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE PARTY LASTS ALL YEAR BECAUSE  THE GIRLS ARE NEVER IN SCHOOL! [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, OUR HEROIC DRONES HAVE SO  RATTLED AL QAEDA, ITS LEADERS  ARE DISTRIBUTING A 22-POINT TIPSHEET ON HOW TO AVOID THEM. LIKE TIP NUMBER TWELVE "MAINTAIN  COMPLETE SILENCE OF ALL WIRELESS  CONTACTS."  HERE'S A PRO-TIP: SWITCH TO  AT&T. NO ONE WILL EVER FIND YOU! [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I LOVE IT  AND THEN THERE'S TIP NUMBER 18  ENCOURAGING MILITANTS TO ARRANGE  FAKE GATHERINGS USING DOLLS ANDï¿½i STATUES TO MISLEAD THE ENEMY.   EEN ONLY A STRATEGY PRES   ]:Sv   IN THE AL QAEDA TRAINING VIDEO  "HOME AL LONE." [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. THIS TIP SHEET ALSO HAS THE KEY  TO BRINGING RELUCTANT LIBERALS  ON BOARD WITH OUR DRONE PROGRAM. NUMBER TEN READS:  "HIDE UNDER THICK TREES BECAUSE  THEY ARE THE BEST COVER AGAINST THE PLANES," ADVICE  THAT ORIGINATED WITH BIN LADEN  HIMSELF, WHO  WROTE, "I WANT THE BROTHERS IN THE ISLAMIC MAGHREB TO KNOW THAT  PLANTING TREES HELPS THE  MUJAHEDEEN AND GIVES THEM  COVER. TREES WILL GIVE THE MUJAHEDEEN  THE FREEDOM TO MOVE AROUND."  YOU HEAR THAT, TREE HUGGERS? [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OUR DRONE PROGRAM IS ENCOURAGING  REFORESTATION. [LAUGHTER] SO UNLESS YOU SUPPORT OUR  DEATHBOTS YOU'RE KILLING THE  PLANET. REMEMBER, THINK LOCALLY, BOMB  GLOBALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
