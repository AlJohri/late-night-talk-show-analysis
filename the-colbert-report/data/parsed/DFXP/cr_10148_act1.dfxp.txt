STEPHEN: TONIGHT, I TAKE A LOOK AT THE MID TERM ELECTIONS. LITTLE KNOWN FACT -- THEY'RE HAPPENING THIS YEAR. (LAUGHTER) THEN A NEW THREAT IN THE WAR ON TERROR. BUT I HAVEN'T FINISHED CLEANING MY PANTS FROM THE LAST THREAT! (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEDDY ROOSEVELT AND WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT, SOON TO BE A FILM STARRING JAMES FRANCO AND SETH HOWARD ROGEN. (LAUGHTER) AUTHORITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE SEARCHING FOR A DANGEROUS ESCAPED ALBINO COBRA. THOUGH, TO BE SAFE, POLICE HAVE ARRESTED SEVEN "BLACK" COBRAS. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUS     CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY     COMEDY CENTRAL ♪♪ (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
STEPHEN: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WELCOME TO THE REPORT! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, FOLKS! I HOPE EVERYONE AT HOME CAN HEAR THE PRECISION OF THAT CHANTING. THAT IS WHAT WE CALL IN THE PUNDIT BUSINESS THE  METRONOME OF LOVE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I WANT TO START OFF WITH A RARE APOLOGY. FAR TOO OFTEN, I SIT AT THIS DESK  AND YELL INTO THAT CAMERA AS THE EPITOME OF ANANGRY AMERICAN. YOU DESERVE MORE THAN THAT. SO TONIGHT, I AM YELLING AS  THE EPITOME OF AN  ANGRY IRISH CATHOLIC AMERICAN. (CHEERING) TELL 'EM WHY, JIM.
ORGANIZERS OF THE ANNUAL ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE HERE IN NEW YORK, THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD, SAY THEY WILL NOW ALLOW GAYS TO MARCH NEXT YEAR UNDER THEIR OWN BANNER FOR THE FIRST TIME.
IN THE PAST, GROUPS HAD BEEN PROHIBITED FROM MARCHING WITH BANNERS IDENTIFYING THEM AS GAY.
STEPHEN: GAYS IN THE ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE! WE IRISH SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING. FIRST THEY STOLE OUR RAINBOWS. NEXT THEY'LL BE COMING AFTER ME LUCKY CHARMS! NEXT THEY'LL BE COMING AFTER ME LUCKY CHARMS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M NOT ONLY A PROUD IRISH CATHOLIC, I'M AS STRAIGHT AS THEY COME. I EVEN MADE SURE THE BLARNEY STONE WASN'T A DUDE BEFORE I KISSED IT. (LAUGHTER) AND, AT FIRST, I LIKED THE IDEA OF MAKING GAYS MARCH WITH A BANNER IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES. (LAUGHTER) BUT LUCKILY, BEFORE I BECAME TOO OKAY WITH THE IDEA, FOX NEWS REMINDED ME I WAS OUTRAGED.
THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY UP IN ARMS OVER GAY GROUPS BEING ALLOWED IN THIS YEAR'S ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE.
THERE'S AN OUTCRY FROM THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY THIS MORNING.
THERE IS OUTRAGE THIS MORNING FROM SOME CATHOLIC LEADERS BECAUSE A GAY GROUP WILL MARCH IN THE ST. PATRICK'S VALEN -- UH -- ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE.
STEPHEN: SEE? STEVE DOOCY'S SO MAD, HE CAN'T EVEN SAY A COHERENT SENTENCE ON CAMERA. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) HE'S CLEARLY BEEN FURIOUS ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS! AND REMEMBER, AND REMEMBER, THEY SAID CATHOLIC LEADERS. HE PROBABLY MEANS BILL DONOHUE, HEAD OF THE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE CATHOLIC LEAGUE, WHO SAID THERE WAS "NO CONTROVERSY." (LAUGHTER) OKAY. THAT OUTRAGE WAS MORE NUANCED THAN I EXPECTED, BUT HE'S NOT AN OFFICIAL LEADER OF THE CHURCH. YOU KNOW, CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN HAS PROBABLY GOT  HIS CHAUSABLE IN A BUNCH. BLESS 'EM A NEW ONE, TIMMY!
I THINK THE DECISION THEY'VE MADE IS A WISE ONE. I HAVE NO TROUBLE WITH THE DECISION AT ALL.
STEPHEN: HUH! I GUESS HE'S SO ANGRY HE FORGOT TO BE MAD. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE IN, GAYS. BUT WE CATHOLICS HAVE ONE FIRM DEMAND.
THE CATHOLIC LEAGUE SAYS IT HOPES NEW ENTRIES TO THE PARADE WILL CONDUCT THEMSELVES IN A MANNER THAT STILL HONORS ST. PATRICK.
STEPHEN: YOU LISTENING, GAYS? THIS ISN'T ONE OF YOUR DEGENERATE PRIDE PARADES. KEEP IT DIGNIFIED. YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS! (GUYS YELLING)
ST. PADDY'S DAY, A DAY TO GET (BLEEP) TRASHED.
STEPHEN: AHH, I LOVE RIVERDANCE! (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, IT'S OFFICIALLY FALL, WHICH MEANS WE ARE IN THE HOMESTRETCH TO THE 2014 MID TERM ELECTIONS, AND I AM BURSTING WITH MID-THUSIASM. (LAUGHTER) IN JUST 62 DAYS, AMERICANS NATIONWIDE WILL WAKE UP AND SAY, "DAMMIT. I FORGOT TO VOTE YESTERDAY ." (LAUGHTER) SO TONIGHT, WE CELEBRATE THE "LAUNCH" OF OUR MIDTERM COVERAGE BY BRINGING OUT THE U.S.S. DEMOCRACY 2014 AND CHRISTENING HER WITH A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THOUGH AMERICA BE ROCKED BY TROUBLED WATERS, SHE IS YET STURDY AND PROUD. LONG MAY SHE SAIL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHANTING "U.S.A. " ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHANTING "U.S.A. " )
STEPHEN: THANK YOU. IT'S TIME FOR "THE COLBERT REPORT" MID-TERM ROUNDUP!
YEE-HAW! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: AS ALWAYS, A HEARTY THANKS TO MY GOOD FRIEND STEVE CARELL FOR LETTING US REUSE THAT FOOTAGE WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. FIRST UP, FOLKS, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MID-TERM IN MID-MEMORY, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST ONE. AND YOU CAN TELL THE DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING SCARED BECAUSE THEY'VE BEGUN ACTIVATING THEIR BASE. THE LADY VOTERS. JUST LOOK AT COSMO, WHICH ANNOUNCED THEY WILL BE COVERING THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS WITH "A NEW EFFORT THAT WILL INCLUDE CANDIDATE ENDORSEMENTS" IN AN ATTEMPT "TO GET READERS TO THE POLLS AND BE PART OF" THE PARTY OF THE YEAR ." I JUST HOPE COSMO'S ELECTION ADVICE IS JUST AS MISGUIDED AS THEIR SEX ADVICE -- ENTER THE BOOTH, WRAP ONE LEG BEHIND YOUR HEAD, RUB SOME HOT SAUCE ON THE LEVER AND THEN... (WHISTLE) PINKY UP HIS BUTT. (CHEERING) NOW, THIS IS CLEARLY GOING TO INCREASE VOTER TURNOUT, SO I'VE GOT SOME COSMO ADVICE OF MY OWN. HELLO, LADIES. I KNOW YOU ARE BEING ENCOURAGED TO BECOME POLITICALLY ENGAGED, BUT LET ME TELL YOU, GIRLFRIEND, THOSE CURTAINS DON'T LOOK GOOD ON ANYONE. IT'S BASICALLY LIKE WEARING A BOOTH MUUMUU. PLUS, ALL ANYONE'S GONNA BE DOING IS LOOKING AT YOUR CALVES. WHAT IF YOU HAVE CANKLES? AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW  WHETHER YOU HAVE CANKLES, YOU HAVE CANKLES (CHEERING) DON'T VOTE. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE FIRST RACE YOU SHOULD NOT VOTE IN -- THE HOUSE RACE IN GEORGIA'S TENTH DISTRICT, WHERE RIGHT-WING PASTOR AND RADIO HOST JODY HICE HAS ALL BUT GUARANTEED A WIN BY BUILDING A DIVERSE COALITION OF PEOPLE HE DOESN'T WANT IN HIS COALITION. SO FAR, HE'S "COMPARED BEING GAY TO ALCOHOLISM, DRUG ADDICTION, TENDENCIES TO LIE AND TO BE VIOLENT," HE HAS SAID A WOMAN CAN ENTER POLITICS AS LONG AS SHE'S "WITHIN THE AUTHORITY OF HER HUSBAND," AND SAID MUSLIMS DON'T DESERVE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. (AUDIENCE REACTS) I AGREE. MUSLIMS DO NOT DESERVE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. THEY WOULD JUST USE IT TO OFFEND WOMEN AND GAY PEOPLE, AND HICE ALREADY HAS THAT COVERED. AND JODY HICE KNOWS A THING OR TWO ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION, AND HE ISN'T AFRAID TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT WHILE HOLDING A SCROLL IN A FOYER.
WHEN OUR FOUNDERS CONVENED AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN PHILADELPHIA IN 1787, THEY CRAFTED, I BELIEVE WITH GOD'S HELP, THE MOST BRILLIANT GOVERNING DOCUMENT IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY ."
STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT. THE FOUNDERS GOT THEIR IDEAS DIRECTLY FROM GOD. (LAUGHTER) I BELIEVE IT WAS YAWHEH WHO WROTE THOMAS JEFFERSON'S FAMOUS LINE, "I LOVES ME SOME BROWN SUGAR!" (CHEERING) BUT NOW HICE IS UNDER ATTACK BY THE BUZZ-KILLS AT BUZZ-FEED WHO HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MANY OF THE INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES FROM FOUNDING FATHERS ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE" ARE FAKE." FOR EXAMPLE, HICE'S PAGE SAYS JEFFERSON WROTE, "THAT GOVERNMENT IS BEST WHICH GOVERNS THE LEAST BECAUSE ITS PEOPLE DISCIPLINE THEMSELVES," EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ACTUALLY HENRY DAVID THOREAU, WHO LIVED ALONE AT WALDEN POND, SO I'M SURE HE ENGAGED IN FURIOUS "SELF-DISCIPLINE." AND HICE ALSO ATTRIBUTED THE INSPIRATIONAL QUOTE "IF YOUR ACTIONS INSPIRE OTHERS TO DREAM MORE, LEARN MORE, DO MORE, AND BECOME MORE, YOU ARE A LEADER" TO JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, ALTHOUGH IT'S ACTUALLY FROM DOLLY PARTON. (LAUGHTER) IT'S EASY TO MISTAKE THOSE TWO, ESPECIALLY AFTER JOHN QUINCY ADAMS GOT THOSE IMPLANTS. (LAUGHTER) HICE HAS USED SO MANY MISATTRIBUTIONS THAT BUZZFEED FOUND EIGHT EXAMPLES OF THE FRAUDULENT QUOTES BEFORE THEY "STOPPED LOOKING." (LAUGHTER) WOW. THERE'S YOUR HEADLINE -- BUZZFEED STOPPED LOOKING FOR EXAMPLES OF SOMETHING? THAT RAISES A TROUBLING QUESTION -- COULD THERE ALSO BE MORE THAN "13 POTATOES THAT LOOK LIKE CHANNING TATUM?" (LAUGHTER) NATION, I "LIKE" WHAT HICE IS DOING ON FACEBOOK, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE "LIKING" IS THE ONLY OPTION ON FACEBOOK. THOSE QUOTES MAY NOT HAVE COME FROM OUR FOUNDING FATHERS, BUT DOES IT REALLY MATTER? IT'S LIKE GEORGE WASHINGTON SAID AT VALLEY FORGE,  "CLOSE ENOUGH FOR JAZZ. VOTE HICE 2014 ." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
