Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, FOLKS, MY VACATION WAS JUST FANTASTIC AND ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT BEING ON VACATION IS SPENDING MORE TIME WITH THE WIFE AND KIDS, I ESPECIALLY LOOK FORWARD TO MY FAMILY'S WEEKLY GAME NIGHT. BECAUSE NOTHING IS BETTER THAN A ROUND OF CLUE TO TAKE EVERYONE'S MINE OFF THAT-- TAKE EVERYONE'S MIND OFF THAT CANDLESTICK MURDER THAT HAPPENED IN OUR CONSERVATORY. BUT I RECENTLY LEARNED SOMETHING DISTURBING ABOUT ONE OF OUR CLASSIC GAMES.
FOR ITS FIRST TIME IN NEARLY A DECADE 5,000 NEW WORDS WILL APPEAR IN THE NEW EDITION OF SCRABBLE'S OFFICIAL DICTIONARY INCLUDING WORDS LIKE HASHTAG, SELFIE, BUZZKILL AND BROMANCE.
THAT'S RIGHT, HASBRO HAS ADDED NEW SCRABBLE WORDS AND I'M SORRY, BUT THIS ENDS OUR HASBRO-MANCE BECAUSE THIS ASSAULT ON OUR TRADITIONAL SCRABBLE VOCABULARY MAKES ME MAD, NO, CHANGE THAT TO VEXED (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THIS IS NOTHING BUT A CHEAP ATTEMPT BY THE LEXI CONARTISTS OVER AT HASBRO TO PANDER TO THE YOUNG LINGS OUT THERE. AT ROBIN POLLOCK DANIEL CHAMPION OF THE SCRABBLE ASSOCIATION PUT IT, IT MAKES THE GAME MORE ACCESSIBLE TO YOUNGER PEOPLE. WHICH WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR, ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WORDS MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THEM. THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS. THE NEW WORDS CAPTURE THE WAY YOUNG PEOPLE SPEAK, AT LEAST THE ONES WHO ARE CHILLAXING AT THE FUNPLEX WHILE GEOCACHING SOME SCHMUTZ. AND CHECK THIS OUT. TO APPEAL TO THE VALUED ESKIMO YOUTH DEMO THEY HAVE ALSO ADDED QAJAQ WHICH IS THE INUIT SPELLING FOR KAYAK. WE CANNOT ALLOW INUIT WORDS IN SCRABBLE. NOW ANY RANDOM JUMBLE OF TILES IS LIKELY TO BE ONE OF THEIR 400 WORDS FOR SNOW. AND WORST OF ALL, TRUTHINESS, A WORD THAT I CREATED, THAT BECAME MERRIAM WEBSTER'S 2006 WORD OF THE YEAR--  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IS NOT IN THE REVISED SCRABBLE DICTIONARY. BUT ASK YOURSELF, ASK YOURSELF, DOESN'T IT FEEL LIKE IT IS? (LAUGHTER) AND WHEN YOU PLAY DOESN'T IT FEEL LIKE IT HAS A SILENT Q AND Z? WELL, JUST BECAUSE THIS NEW DICTIONARY IS FILLED WITH SCHMUTZ, DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T STILL BEAT ANY YOUNG PERSON AT SCRABBLE. BRANDON, GET ON OUT HERE. BRANDON, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HERE WE GO. HERE YOU GO. BRANDON AND I, BRANDON AND I EARLIER BEFORE THE SHOW WE WERE PLAYING A GAME RIGHT HERE. FUN GAME, ISN'T IT, BRANDON?
SURE. IT'S LIKE WORDS WITH FRIENDS.
Stephen: WE ARE NOT FRIENDS. OKAY, I'LL GO FIRST. LET'S SEE. LET'S TRY THIS. L, OH, THE G, LOG, BEAT THAT.
HMMMM.
Z-G-I-N-G.
Stephen: OKAY, WHAT IS  VLOGGING, THAT IS A MADE UP WORD.
NO IT'S WHEN YOU CREATE A BLOG WITH VIDEO MATERIAL, IT'S IN THE NEW DICTIONARY.
Stephen: OKAY, FINE, FINE, THEN I'M GOING TO SPELL B-U-R-G-L-K-A-F. (LAUGHTER) THERE YOU GO. GO.
THAT'S NOT A WORD.
Stephen: OH, REALLY, BECAUSE YOU JUST USED IT IN A SENTENCE, SMART GUY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND YOU'RE A YOUNG PERSON, YOU'RE A YOUNG PERSON SO I WILL JUST WAIT A FEW MONTHS AND SCRABBLE WILL PUT IT IN THEIR STUPID DICTIONARY. GO.
OKAY. HERE. BURGLKOFS IS. TRIPLE WORD SCORE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: GOD DAMMIT! GET OUT OF HERE GET OUT OF HERE, YOU CHEATER! (APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I I WANT HIM OUT.
