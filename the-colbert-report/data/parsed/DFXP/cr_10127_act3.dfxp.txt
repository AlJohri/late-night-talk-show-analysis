(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE THE COHOST OF PUBLIC RADIO'S RADIOLAB. WHICH I BELIEVE IS WHERE THEY TEST NPR ON ANIMALS PLEASE WELCOME ROBERT KRULWICH AND JAD ABUMRAD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JAD, ROBERT, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT, GUYS, FOR THE FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T KNOW, JAD, ROBERT, YOU ARE THE COHOST OF WNYC HERE IN NEW YORK THAT PRODUCES THE PEABODY AWARD-WINNING RADIOLAB, ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SHOWS ON PUBLIC RADIO, 478 STATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY, DOWNLOADED POD CASTS MORE THAN 4 MILLION TIMES EVERY MONTH. WHAT IS-- WHAT IS RADIOLAB? (LAUGHTER) AND WHAT ARE YOU EXPERIMENTING ON? (LAUGHTER)
ON THE RADIO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY, I MEAN IT'S-- .
Stephen: EXPERIMENTING ON THE MEDIUM ITSELF.
YEAH, NEW WAYS OF TELLING STORIES. THE LAB IS IN A SENSE TO EXPERIMENT TRYING ALL THE USUAL WAYS OF TELLING STORIES BUT JUST DOING IT DIFFERENTLY.
Stephen: OKAY. YEAH, SURE, SURE. FOR THE PURPOSE OF OUR DISCUSSION I WILL SAY I FOLLOWED THAT, ALL RIGHT? BUT WHY DO YOU NEED TO TELL STORIES IN A NEW WAY. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING STORIES SINCE, YOU KNOW, CAVEMAN SAID UG KILL BEAR.
WE JUST LIKE TO PLAY, I GUESS. WE JUST-- THERE'S AN ADVENTURE TO THIS. SO WE JUST-- WE ENJOY MAKING UP-- WE CHOOSE COMPLICATED SUBJECTS. WE DON'T COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THEM ALL THE TIME AND THEN WE TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF THEM. AND TO DO THAT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE FUN AND EXPERIMENT AND YOU GOT TO DO MISCHIEF.
Stephen: SO YOU DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THE THINGS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ON THE SHOW.
NO, I WITHOUT SAY IT IS A PREREQUISITE. WE START IN A PLAY CALLED ABSOLUTE UNKNOWING.
Stephen: DOW EVER END IN A PLACE OF ABSOLUTE UNKNOWING.
PRETTY MUCH EVERY SINGLE TIME.
Stephen: REALLY.
SO OUR ARC IS A LITTLE HARD. WE GO FROM NONKNOWLEDGE TO A LITTLE BIT OF KNOWLEDGE TO AH, KIND OF.
Stephen: SO IF YOU ARE YOUR FANS COME UP TO YOU AND SAY I GOT TO SAY I LISTENED TO THE SHOW THIS WEEKEND, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. YOU SAY SUCCESS.
EXACTLY. AS LONG AS THEY REMEMBER SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SAID. YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE SOMETHING THAT STICKS TO THEM.
Stephen: OKAY, IS YOUR-- YOU'RE LIBERALS, OBVIOUSLY--  (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE YOU WORK FOR PUBLIC RADIO. YOU WORK FOR PUBLIC RADIO.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
Stephen: I KNOW YOU WORK FOR PUBLIC RADIO AND THAT'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW. OKAY, THERE'S TWO CONSERVATIVES ON PUBLIC RADIO AND THEIR NAMES ARE CLICK AND CLACK. THE TAPPET BROTHERS. IS CURIOSITY ITSELF A LIBERAL VALUE? BECAUSE I'M A CONSERVATIVE, AND I BELIEVE THAT IT IS SOMETIMES BETTER NOT TO KNOW THAN TO KNOW. (LAUGHTER) KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ALWAYS A GOOD
WELL, TO NOT KNOW CAN BE KIND OF SCARY, THAT IS TRUE. BUT THEN-- .
Stephen: AND FEAR CAN BE A GOOD THING.
THERE WAS ACTUALLY A REALLY LONG PERIOD IN HISTORY OF THE WORLD WHERE PEOPLE WERE TOLD NOT TO BE CURIOUS THAT IT WAS SINFUL AND SO ON.
Stephen: WELL, SOMETIMES IT IS.
SOMETIMES IT CAN GET YOU IN TROUBLE.
Stephen: IT DID NOT WORK OUT WELL FOR OEDIPUS
NO IT DIDN'T.
Stephen: OR FOR ADAM AND EVE,.
SO THERE IS A LESSON TO BE LEARNED THERE I SUPPOSE. BUT FOR US WE JUST CAN'T HELP OURSELVES. I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING IN HUMANS, CONSERVATIVE AND LIBERALS THAT SAYS HMMMM, I WOULD LIKE-- LIKE A CLOUD, YOU FIND OUT IT WEIGHS 500 TONS AND YET IT'S IN THE SKY.
Stephen: IT DOESN'T WEIGH 500 TONS. CLOUDS DON'T WEIGH. NEWS FLASH CLOUDS DON'T WEIGH ANYTHING, OKAY. THAT IS HOW THEY FLOAT. OKAY, --
WHAT DOES A BALLOON WEIGH.
Stephen: LESS THAN NOTHING.
IF YOU TOOK A TEASPOON YOU COULD WEIGH A LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD, YOU MULTIPLY THAT TEASPOON TOWARD A CLOUD YOU HAVE A LOT-- .
Stephen: SO PARTS OF A CLOUD WEIGH SOMETHING BUT THE ENTIRE CLOUD WEIGHS NOTHING.
NO. (LAUGHTER)
NO, I WAS THINKING-- .
Stephen: YOU DO MOST OF THE WORK, RIGHT? YOU DO-- BECAUSE YOU--  (APPLAUSE) YOU GOT ONE OF THEM McARTHUR GENIUS GRANTS BACK IN 2011. DID YOU EVER LORD THAT OVER HIM AND GO ONE OF US HAS A GENIUS GRANT.
NO, 'CAUSE THE WHOLE GENIUS THING IS A LITTLE TRIPPY.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, WHAT DOES TRIPPY MEAN.
DEEPLY CONFUSING.
Stephen: LIKE YOUR SHOW.
AND ALSO --
YES.
PEOPLE SUDDENLY THOUGHT HE WAS REALLY SMART BECAUSE HE WAS A GENIUS. THAT IS ODD.
Stephen: YOU ASK BIG QUESTIONS, LIKE WHAT IS TIME. DOES EVIL REALLY EXIST. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT DOING A SHOW CALLED DO THESE QUESTIONS MAKE US SEEM HIGH? (LAUGHTER)
I TELL YOU WHAT, I THINK THERE IS AN ASPECT OF THE SHOW THAT IS SORT OF THAT POT SMOKING IN YOUR DORM ROOM WHOA SORT OF THING. I THINK THAT IS WHERE IT BEGINS.
Stephen: IT SOUNDS THAT WAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL THE SOUND EFFECTS, YOU HAVE THIS-- ROBERT-- KRULWICH RADIO-- YOU KNOW.
I MEAN I THINK YOU WANT TO START WITH THAT PLACE OF DISORIENTING, BUT THEN YOU REALLY DO TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT. YOU TRY AND KNOW AND WALK THROUGH STEP-BY-STEP INTO ALL THE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF THESE QUESTIONS.
Stephen: WHAT IS NEXT. WHERE IS YOUR CURIOSITY LEADING YOU NEXT. DO YOU HAVE A SEASON OR JUST GRIND IN AND OUT.
DOING IT-- WE JUST MAKE IT, WE ARE ALWAYS ON.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT THIS ONE. HOW MUCH DOES CANADA WEIGH?
THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION.
THAT'S A HARD ONE BECAUSE IN THE WINTER WHEN IT IS SNOWING IT MIGHT BE HEAVIER. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHERE WOULD YOU STOP WHEN ARE YOU WEIGHING IT. YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN.
Stephen: ALL THE WAY TO THE CORE. YOU A LITTLE WEDGE.
THE TOP OF IT IS MELTING SO THAT MIGHT GET IT LIGHTER OR HEAVIER. SEE THAT IS THE KIND OF THING WE DO, EXACTLY.
YOU START WITH AN OPEN QUESTION AND START THINKING DEEPER AND DEEPER.
Stephen: CAN I GET A LITTLE TASTE OF THE BACK END ON THAT ONE?
PUBLIC RADIO, DON'T FORGET.
Stephen: OH, OKAY, JUST GIVE ME A TOTE BAG. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME, ROBERT, JAD, JAD ABUMRAD, ROBERT KRULWICH, RADIOLAB, IT'S ON ALL THE TIME. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
