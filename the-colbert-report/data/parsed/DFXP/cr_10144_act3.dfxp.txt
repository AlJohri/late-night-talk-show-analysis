WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT PLAYS A RESEARCHER OF HUMAN SEXUALITY IN THE SHOWTIME SERIES MASTERS OF SEX. I ASSUMED HE RESEARCHED HIS PART BY WATCHING A LOT OF CINEMAX. PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL SHEEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANKS FOR COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT, I AM AN ENORMOUS FAN, AN ENORMOUS FAN OF YOURS. I WILL BRING OUT THE GUNS LATER BUT FIRST I WANT TO SAY, I REALLY LIKED YOU, I SAW YOU ON FROST/NIXON ON BROADWAY, INCREDIBLE. OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE KNOW YOU FROM THE QUEEN, MIDNIGHT IN PARIS. YOU CURRENTLY STAR IN SHOW TIME'S MASTERS OF SEX, NOW IN ITS SECOND SEASON, SUNDAYS AT 10 P.M. THE MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU'RE A WELSHMAN, CORRECT.
I AM FIRST AND FOREMOST A WELSHMAN
Stephen: IF ANY MOMENT YOU WANT TO BREAK INTO A COAL MINING DITTY OR SING MEN OF HARLECH, I AM HERE FOR YOU. ♪ MEN OF HARLECH, STAND YE STEADY ♪  WE MUST ALWAYS BE AT READY ♪ ♪.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOW LISTEN, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SING THAT WITH A WELSHMAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY, MASTERS OF SEX, DO YOU PLAY TONY BLAIR IN THIS ONE TOO?
I DO. TONY BLAIR.
Stephen: I CAN'T PICTURE TONY BLAIR HAVING SEX, FRANKLY.
THAT COULD NEVER BE PICTURED, SURELY
Stephen: NOW TELL THE PEOPLE MASTERS AND JOHNSON ARE THE PEOPLE THIS IS BASED ON SO THESE WERE REAL PEOPLE, RIGHT WHAT WERE THEY TRYING TO DO.
THEY WERE REAL PEOPLE. VIRGINIA JOHNSON HAD NO MEDICAL BACKGROUND. SHE TURNED OUT TO BECOME DR. MASTER'S SECRETARY  AND FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS DOING SORT OF SECRET SEX STUDY BECAUSE IT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL THIS WAS IN THE 50s.
Stephen: BACK THEN IT WAS JUST FiRM HANDSHAKE, GOOD NIGHT, MADAME AND NINE MONTHS LATER THERE WAS A BABY.
A SHAKE OF THE LEG, AND YOU'RE ON TO THE NEXT ONE  BUT YEAH, SO THEY WERE DOING THIS-- THIS SEX STUDY BUT THEY HAD TO SORT OF DO IT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE OUTDOORS AND THAT WOULD BE WRONG.
Stephen: WHICH IS ALSO A LITTLE SEXY.
YES. AND SO SHE HELPED HIM WITH THAT AND EVENTUALLY SHE BECAME AN EQUAL PARTNER. BUT OBVIOUSLY IT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL AT THE TIME.
Stephen: BUT KINSEY HAD ALREADY DONE SOME STUFF.
HE HAD. BUT MAINLY RELIED ON ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE
Stephen: LIKE I HEARD THIS GUY ONCE DID THIS THING.
YEAH. WELL THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY SO MUCH HAS CHANGED NOW. WE'VE COME SUCH A LONG WAY. WHEN I WAS IN DRAMA SCHOOL.
Stephen: OH MY GOD. YES.
WE USED TO BE AFFILIATED WITH A MEDICAL SCHOOL DOWN THE  ROAD AND SOMETIMES THEY WOULD ASK US TO COME AND IMPROVISE AS PEOPLE WITH SOME SORT OF SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP FOR THE DOCTORS TO LEARN FROM. SO WE WOULD GET ALL THESE REAL CASES AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO PRETEND WE WERE THEN AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO WORK OUT THE PROBLEM. AND ONE TIME THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE COUPLE, THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WEREN'T GETTING PREGNANT AND IT TURNED OUT THE COUPLE WERE HAVING SEX IN EACH OTHER'S ARMPITS.
Stephen: WAS IT GOOD?
I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW HE HAS SEX IN HER ARMPIT. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW SHE HAS SEX IN HIS ARMPIT.
HOW MUCH YOU HAVE TO LEARN, STEPHEN.
Stephen: THAT MIGHT BE WHAT SCISSORING IS
AS AN ACTOR DOING THIS, WHAT KIND OF RESEARCH DID YOU DO. DID YOU HAVE TO DO A RIDE-ALONG? DID YOU HAVE TO DO ANY SEX RESEARCH. DO YOU ENJOY THE SEX?
I DID THE SEX ONCE AND I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER LILY. AS A RESULT.
ARE YOU CLAPPING FOR MY DAUGHTER OR THE SEX I HAD. SO I DID IT THE ONCE IT WAS LIKE GOING TO SCHOOL, ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL I WENT. MY MOTHER SAID HOW WAS IT I SAID IT WAS LOVELY BUT I'M NOT GOING AGAIN, BUT THAT WAS SORT OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE WITH THE SEX.
Stephen: BUT DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING, BECAUSE HERE'S MY PROBLEM. HERE'S WHERE THE GUNS COME OUT. I THINK SEX IS FINE, I'M A FAN, OKAY. BUT DO WE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT IT? DOESN'T THAT TAKE SOME OF THE MYSTERY OUT OF IT? YOU KNOW, NOT KNOWING. I KNOW I'M A GUY, I KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT. AND THE GIRLS HAVE GOT THE-- AND NEED WE KNOW MORE THAN THAT? I MEAN WHY DISSECT THE RAINBOW.
THIS IS JUST THE ATTITUDE THAT WILLIAM MASTERS HAD TO DEAL WITH IN THE '50s.
Stephen: AND BECAUSE HE DEALT WITH THAT, NOW WE KNOW EVERYTHING AND NOTHING IS REALLY EXCITING ANY MORE. BACK THEN THE SEARS CATALOG WAS A TURN-ON. NOW THERE'S NOTHING ON THE INTERNET THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME YAWN. HAVEN'T WE GONE TOO FAR. THAT WAS A FORM OF SEX, YAWNING. THE SPECIAL PORNOGRAPHIC WEB SITES FOR PEOPLE THAT GET TURNED ON BY YAWNING.
DO YOU HAVE --
WE HAVE GONE TOO FAR. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY SEX, WE ARE NOW INUNDATED WITH IMAGES OF SEX AND SEXUALITY ALL THE TIME. IT HAS BECOME BRANDED, IT'S BECOME COMMERCIALIZED. IN SOME WAYS WE ARE JUST AS PRONE TO FEELING SHAME ABOUT SEX AS IN ITS '50s WHEN THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT. DID THESE GUYS GET IN TROUBLE WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
THEY GOT IN A FAIR AMOUNT OF TROUBLE, YES.
THEY WENT THROUGH VERY CONTROVERSIAL THINGS LIKE AT ONE POINT THEY SAID THEY COULD CURE SOMEONE FROM BEING GAY.
HOW DID THEY DO THAT?
IT'S FOR A FRIEND.
TELL ME LATER.
MICHAEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. MICHAEL SHEEN, MASTERS OF SEX, SUNDAYS AT 10:00 ON SHOW TIME. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
