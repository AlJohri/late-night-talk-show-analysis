(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, THERE IS ONLY ONE NEWS  STORY ANYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT  TODAY? TOMORROW'S BLOCKBUSTER  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN DENVER! THE MILE-HIGH MATCHUP. THE UP ENDER IN DENVER. THE THRILLA BETWEEN CHOCOLATE  AND VANILLA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I CANNOT OVERSTATE THE  IMPORTANCE OF THIS DEBATE  BECAUSE THE T.V. ALREADY HAS.
ON THURSDAY MORNING THE  ENTIRE NARRATIVE OF THIS RACE IS  GOING TO CHANGE.
STRONG PERFORMANCE BY ROMNEY  COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING.
THE DEBATE NIGHT THAT COULD  CHANGE EVERYTHING.
OF COURSE THE NIGHT COULD  CHANGE EVERYTHING.
YES, THE DEBATE COULD CHANGE  EVERYTHING. THE PAST TWO YEARS OF RELENTLESS  CAMPAIGNING WILL MEAN JACK  SQUAT. TOTAL RESET BACK TO YEAR ZERO OF  AMERICA. WE WILL ABANDON THE CITIES AND  SEEK REFUGE IN CLIFF SIDE CAVES  SPEAKING ONLY IN HUSHED TONES  ABOUT THE TIME MAN STOLE FIRE FROM THE SKY. MONEY FOR OUR CURRENCY SHOULD BE  BLOOD SACRIFICE OFFERED TO OUR  NEW RULERS, A RACE OF  SUPERINTERGENT FERAL CATS. (LAUGHTER)  OH, SHOW US YOUR MERCY,  WHISKERED ONES. (LAUGHTER)  OR-- OR ROMNEY COULD GET A  TWO-POINT BUMP. EITHER WAY IT'S NEWS. (LAUGHTER)  RIGHT NOW, FOLKS, THE OBAMA  PEOPLE WHERE ARE DECEMBER IT  FROMLY TRYING TO LOWER  EXPECTATIONS. IT'S SAD, JUST LISTEN TO OBSCENE  YOUR ADVISOR AND  ANTHROPOMORPHIZED VANISHING  SOUND DAVID PLOUFFE. (LAUGHTER)  JIM?
WE'VE ACCEPTED THAT GOVERNOR  ROMNEY WILL HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. HE'S PREPARED MORE THAN ANY  CANDIDATE IN HIMSELFRY AND SHOWN  HIMSELF TO BE A GOOD DEBATER  THROUGH THE YEARS. WE'RE SURE HE'LL PUT ON QUITE A  SHOW WEDNESDAY.
YES, IF THERE'S ONE WORD  AMERICA ASSOCIATES WITH MITT  ROMNEY IT'S "SHOW."  (LAUGHTER)  MEANWHILE, THE ROMNEY PEOPLE AREN'T PLAYING THESE SILLY  GAMES. THEY'RE JUST BEING HONEST WHEN  THEY HAIL THE PRESIDENT AS A  UNIQUELY GIFTED SPEAKER WHO IS  WIDELY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED POLITICAL  COMMUNICATORS IN MODERN HISTORY. (LAUGHTER)  YES! HE'S A ONE-IN-A-GENERATION  STATESMAN WHOSE RHETORICAL GIFT  TOUCHED THE HUMAN SOUL! WHEN HE SPEAKS SPARROWS OF THE  WOOD ALIGHT UPON BARACK'S  SHOULDERS AS THEY DID UPON SAINT  FRANCIS OF ASSISI. HE'S NO MERE MAN HE'S A  SILVER-TONGUED ANGEL WHOSE WORDS  CAN CURE THE SICK, SOOTHE THE  TROUBLED AND BE USED AS A FLOTATION DEVICE IN AN T EVENT  OF A WATER LANDING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SO ROMNEY-- SO ROMNEY HAS GOT NO  CHANCE AND HERE'S HOW HE'S GOING  TO WIN.
WORD ON THE STREET IS THAT  MITT ROMNEY HAS BEEN PRACTICING  ZINCERS SINCE AUGUST.
THE GOVERNOR'S CAMPAIGN SAID  THEY'RE PREPARED A BUNCH OF  ZINGERS OR ONE LINER.
SYNCERS.
SYNCERS.
Stephen: SYNCERS. BECAUSE AMERICANS NEED TO KNOW  THAT THEIR LEADER HAS A WELL  HONED SENSE OF SYNC. (LAUGHTER)  ON DAY ONE OUR NEW PRESIDENT  MUST BE ABLE TO FACE IRAN'S  LEADER AND ASK HIM IF THE PLACE WHERE HE BOUGHT THAT SHIRT ALSO  HAS A MEN'S DEPARTMENT. (LAUGHTER)  THEN MAYBE SOME SNAPS. YO MAHMOUD'S SO FAST, WHEN HE  GETS AROUND AN EMBARGO, HE GETS  AROUND AN EMBARGO! (LAUGHTER)  GOOD LUCK, MITT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
