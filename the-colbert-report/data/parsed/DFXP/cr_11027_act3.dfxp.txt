( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

I'M FINE. I'M FINE.
Stephen: IT'S A PLEASURE. PLEASURE.
I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE.
Stephen: I'M VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU.
CAN I READ YOUR QUESTIONS? ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO READ MY QUESTIONS?
YES.
Stephen: YES. ( LAUGHTER )
"YOU'VE WON THE PULITZER AND NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE."
Stephen: NOT YET, BUT I HOPE TO. ( LAUGHTER ) I WILL NOT BE AMBUSHED! BUT THAT'S A GOOD POINT. YOU HAVE WON THE PULITZER PRIZE AND THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE. THAT IS LIKE THE ROCK 'N' ROLL HALL OF FAME OF BOOKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). LET'S GO THROUGH SOME OF THE BOOKS YOU HAVE WRITTEN. "THE BLUEST EYE." "BELOVED." "SONG OF SOLOMON," "SULA," AMONG OTHERS. WHAT IS THE WEIGHT YOU FEEL, OR IS THERE ANY WEIGHT, ANY BURDEN BEING A NOBEL PRIZE WINNER IN LITERATURE? YOU KNOW, THAT'S-- THAT'S HEMINGWAY. THAT'S DORIS LESSING, THAT'S YOU. DO YOU FEEL WORTHY? ( LAUGHTER )
I KNOW THAT MY BOOKS ARE WORTHY. WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND THAT'S-- THAT'S THE PART THAT I REALLY RELISH, THAT PART. NO, I-- ACTUALLY, I READ "BELOVED" A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
Stephen: YOUR OWN BOOK. YOU READ YOUR OWN BOOK.
I READ MY BOOK.
Stephen: HAD YOU READ IT SINCE YOU WROTE IT?
NO. I NEVER READ THEM AFTER I FINISH THEM UNLESS I'M READING IT PUBLICLY WHEN SOMEONE SAYS "WOULD YOU READ PART OF YOUR BOOK?" BUT I READ IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
Stephen: AND?
IT'S REALLY GOOD. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BRAVA. THAT IS GREAT. I'M A HUGE FAN OF MY WORK, TOO. WERE YOU SURPRISED HOW GOOD YOUR BOOK WAS?
AT THAT TIME, I MEAN, IT'S BEEN YEARS-- WHAT, 80s OR SOMETHING? WHEN WAS THAT BOOK PUBLISHED?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER READ ANYTHING YOU'VE WRITTEN. ( LAUGHTER ).
I THINK IT WAS IN THE 80s. BUT SOMEONE SENT ME A COPY AND SAID WOULD I AUTOGRAPH IT AND I WAS LOOKING FOR A PAGE AND I HAPPENED TO OPEN IT UP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK. AND I LOOKED DOWN, AND THERE WERE THESE SENTENCES, THESE INCREDIBLE, BEAUTIFUL, LYRIC, STRAIGHT AND POWERFUL SENTENCES. SO I JUST KEPT READING. IT HAD BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME.
Stephen: WAS THERE ANY POINT IN READING YOUR OWN POINT THAT YOU THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY. I REALLY SHANKED THAT SENTENCE. WOULD YOU TEMPTED TO DO A REWRITE AT ALL?
THERE ARE BOOKS I THINK I COULD DO A LITTLE BIT OVER. THE FIRST BOOK I WROTE, "THE BLUEST EYE", IS ONE OF THE BOOKS WHERE I THINK I MADE A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MISTAKE IN NOT  DOING JUSTICE TO ONE OF THE CHARACTERS. IT WAS A CHARACTER I DIDN'T LIKE. IT WAS A KIND OF --
Stephen:  WELL, THAT WILL DO IT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I NEVER PAID HER CLOSE ATTENTION.
Stephen: YOU HAVE SAID YOU DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE TO BE PIGEONHOLED AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WRITER. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PIGEONHOLE YOU AS? BECAUSE I HAVE TO CATEGORIZE EVERYBODY. DO YOU WANT TO BE, YOU KNOW, PIGEONHOLED AS A KOREAN POP STAR? HOW SHOULD I SEE YOU AS A CATEGORY? IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WRITER, HOW SHOULD I THINK OF YOU?
AS AN AMERICAN WRITER.
Stephen: AS AN AMERICAN WRITER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). YOU THINK I'M-- I DON'T-- I-- I DON'T SEE RACE. OKAY. I'VE-- I'VE EVOLVED BEYOND RACISM, ALL RIGHT. I DON'T SEE RACE. I DON'T EVEN SEE MY OWN. PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND I BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I HAVEN'T READ ANY OF YOUR BOOKS. ( LAUGHTER ) CAN I, AS A WHITE MAN, UNDERSTAND THE AFRICAN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE?
YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT RACISM.
Stephen: BUT THEN, WOULDN'T I BE A RACIST IF I THOUGHT ABOUT RACISM?
PERHAPS, BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT IS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS RACE. NONE.
Stephen: REALLY?
THERE'S JUST THE HUMAN RACE, SCIENTIFICALLY, ANTHROPOLOGICALLY, RACISM IS A CONSTRUCT, A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT. AND IT HAS BENEFITS. IT HAS MONEY-- MONEY CAN BE MADE OFF OF IT. AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE THEMSELVESES CAN FEEL BETTER BECAUSE OF IT. IT CAN DESCRIBE CERTAIN KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT ARE WRONG OR MISLEADING. SO IT HAS A SOCIAL FUNCTION, RACISM. BUT RACE CAN ONLY BE DEFINED AS A HUMAN BEING.
Stephen: OK, SO -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OBAMA HAS SAID READING YOUR BOOK "THE SONG OF SOLOMON" TAUGHT HIM HOW TO BE.
TRUE, HE DID SAY THAT.
Stephen: IF YOU TAUGHT HIM HOW TO BE, ARE YOU PARTIALLY TO BLAME FOR OBAMACARE? WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO ANYBODY?
I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR OBAMACARE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: OK WE CAN CALL IT --
TONI-CARE.
Stephen: TONI-CARE, THAT'S VERY NICE.
VERY GOOD.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T WRITE YOUR FIRST NOVEL UNTIL YOU WERE 39, CORRECT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: IS YOUR ENTIRE LITERARY CAREER A MIDLIFE CRISIS? ( LAUGHTER ). >>UN, THAT'S A GOOD NAME FOR IT. ACTUALLY.
Stephen: A MIDLIFE CRISIS?
YEAH, SOME KIND OF CRISIS WHERE YOU JUST UP AND CHANGE. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD THAT I WANTED TO READ HAD BEEN WRITTEN. AND THEN IN MY 30s, I WANTED SOMETHING ELSE. I WANTED TO SHOW HOW PAINFUL THIS CONSTRUCTED, HORRIBLE RACISM WAS ON THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN SOCIETY-- GIRLS, BLACK GIRLS, POOR GIRLS-- AND THAT IT REALLY AND TRULY COULD HURT YOU. SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND NO ONE, I THOUGHT, HAD WRITTEN THAT BOOK. SO SINCE I REALLY WANTED TO READ IT, I THOUGHT I SHOULD WRITE IT.
Stephen: AND 25 YEARS LATER, YOU GOT TO READ IT, AND YOU SAID THAT'S DAMN GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) TONI MORRISON, THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. TONI MORRISON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). A HOST OF BOOKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
