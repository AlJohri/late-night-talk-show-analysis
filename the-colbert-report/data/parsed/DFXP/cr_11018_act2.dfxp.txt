(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH! FOLKS, I WANT TO REMIND YOU ALL AGAIN THAT TONIGHT'S SHOW IS LIVE, AND THAT INCLUDES THE COMMERCIALS YOU JUST SAW. I HOPE NONE OF THEM WENT OFF SCRIPT LIKE THAT SHAMEFUL EPISODE WHERE THE PILLSBURY DOUGHBOY TALKED ABOUT WHITE POWER. (LAUGHTER) SO LET'S CHECK IN WITH TONIGHT'S ELECTION RESULTS, IN WISCONSIN'S TIGHT GOVERNOR'S RACE BETWEEN DEMOCRAT MARY BURKE AND INCUMBENT SCOTT WALKER, IT HAS BEEN CALLED FOR WALKER BUT I'M GONNA GROW A PAIR AND SAY WALKER WON AGAIN. FOR DEMOCRATS, THAT MAY BE HARD TO SWALLOW BUT NOT AS HARD AS MILWAUKEE'S BEST. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE MORE RESULTS LATER, ONE IMAGINES. BUT NOT JUST ON TV BECAUSE THIS YEAR, FOLKS, ELECTION COVERAGE IS ALL ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN TRADITIONAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA. FOR INSTANCE, THIS YEAR CNN HAS TEAMED UP  WITH BING AND INTERNET EXPLORER. TOGETHER, THEY WILL STREAM REALTIME RESULTS STRAIGHT TO YOUR DAD'S BEEPER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND IT'S NOT JUST CNN.

Stephen: OH, GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BRET.  SO FOLKS, I'M JUMPING ON THE INTERNET BANDWIDTH WAGON  FOR MORE. LET'S HEAD OVER TO THE SOCIAL TRACKER 8700! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ WELCOME! TO THE SOCIAL TRACKER 8700 WHERE TELEVISION MERGES WITH THE INTERNET BY POINTING A CAMERA AT A COMPUTER SCREEN. WHILE THE REST OF THE NEWS ONLY USES SITES LIKE TWITTER AND Facebook, I'VE GOT THE LATEST BUZZ ON LinkedIn WHERE I'M TRACKING WHICH DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ARE NOW LOOKING FOR A JOB AND IF RICK STILL WANTS ME TO JOIN! LEAVE ME LEAVE ME ALONE, RICK! I DO NOT WISH TO CONNECT WITH YOU! I AM ALSO CHECKING MID-TERM COVERAGE ON AIRBNB, UBER, SEAMLESS, ZAPPOS, FANDANGO AND ADULT FRIEND FINDER. QUALITY PEOPLE, VERY FRIENDLY. I'M ALSO ALL OVER VINE WITH EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE FROM MY COLLEAGUE NBC NEWS' CHUCK TODD. CHUCK, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
THANK YOU, STEPHEN. WE HAVE INTERESTING EXIT POLLS BUT IN A SHOCKING UPSET, I CAN NOW REPORT THAT --
Stephen: THANK YOU, CHUCK. (APPLAUSE) GOTTA TELL YA, HE'S THE BEST. SOUNDS LIKE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GREAT REPORT. SO, NATION, KEEP YOUR TWEETS, HASH TAGS, POSTS, POKES, GRINDERS, GRAMS AND INSTAS COMING. TELL US WHAT YOU THINK,  SO WE CAN REPORT WHAT YOU SAID, THEN YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT YOU THOUGHT SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT IF THERE WAS A   REASON FOR US TO HAVE DONE THIS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
