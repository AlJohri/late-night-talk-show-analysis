["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [EAGLE CAW] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
STEPHEN: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING SEE IT FEN'S  NAME] THANK YOU, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IN RETURN I WANT TO WISH ALL OF  YOU A MERRY CHRIST-CHRISTMAS. I SAY IT THAT WAY, SO IF THE  ATHEISTS TRY TO TAKE THE CHRIST  OUT OF CHRISTMAS, THERE'S STILL ONE LEFT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND AS YOU CAN SEE, MY SET IS  FULLY DECKED FOR THE SEASON. I'VE GOT MY  HISTORICALLY-ACCURATE NATIVITY  SCENE FEATURING MARY, JOSEPH,  FROSTY, AND THE ABOMINABLE  SNOWMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T INCLUDE OPTIMUS PRIME  BECAUSE HE DOES NOT APPEAR IN  THE KING JAMES VERSION. [ LAUGHTER ] AND INSTEAD OF THE BABY JESUS IN  THE CRADLE, I HAVE MY BOOK:  "AMERICAN AGAIN: REBECOMING THE GREATNESS WE NEVER WEREN'T." [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, I WANT YOU TO KNOW --  UNLIKE JESUS, WITH MY BOOK, YOU  WON'T HAVE TO WAIT A THOUSAND YEARS FOR THE SECOND EDITION. [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF BOOKS. PAPA BEAR BILL O'REILLY HAS BEEN  DOMINATING THE BESTSELLER LISTS  WITH HIS HUGE HITS. I WAS HAPPY UNTIL THIS.
YOU'VE GOT "KILLING KENNEDY,"  "KILLING LINCOLN."  WHAT'S THE NEXT ONE?
"KILLING COLBERT."  WELL, I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO  LAUNCH "OPERATION KILLING KILLING KENNEDY" TO KNOCK  O'REILLY'S BOOK FROM THE TOP  SPOT. AND NATION, YOU DID IT. YESTERDAY "AMERICA AGAIN" HIT  NUMBER ONE ON AMAZON! WOOOOOOOOO! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LITERALLY --  LITERALLY READ IT AND WEEP,  BILL! THIS IS HUGE. "KILLING KENNEDY" HAS BEEN ON  THE AMAZON CHARTS FOR TEN WEEKS! NINE WEEKS LONGER THAN IT TOOK  HIM TO WRITE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT ONLY DID "AMERICA AGAIN"  BEAT OUT "KILLING KENNEDY," IT  ALSO BEAT OUT THE KINKY, PSYCHOSEXUAL NOVEL  "FIFTY SHADES OF GREY" DUE, I'M  SURE, TO MY BOOK'S GRAPHIC  DEPICTIONS OF DEPRAVED SADOMASOCHISTIC SEX. [ LAUGHTER ] ONCE AGAIN, MY APOLOGIES TO  DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN. [ LAUGHTER ] AS FOR PAPA BEAR, I HAVE SO  CRUSHED MY HERO, I LOOK FORWARD  TO HIS NEXT BOOK "KILLING A FIFTH OF BOURBON IN A PUDDLE OF  MY OWN TEARS" BY BILL O'REILLY  BUT MY BOOK IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT HAS CAPTURED THE  IMAGINATION OF AMERICA. THE COUNTRY IS GRIPPED BY THE  PROSPECT THAT I WILL BE  APPOINTED TO REPLACE JIM DeMINT IN THE US SENATE BY SOUTH  CAROLINA GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I AM RAKING IN THE  -- IT'S ELECTRIC! AND I AM RAKING IN THE  ENDORSEMENTS. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN ASKED ABOUT  MY APPOINTMENT WITH DESTINY  SENATOR JOHN McCAIN RECENTLY SAID QUOTE, "HE WOULD BE A VERY  VALUED MEMBER IN THAT HE SEEMS  TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT US, SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE  FITTING IN." [ LAUGHTER ] YES, I'D FIT RIGHT INTO THE  SENATE. I LOVE ANY JOB THAT HAS RECESS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN FACT, McCAIN AND I ARE  ALREADY ENGAGING IN SOME  FRIENDLY JOSHING.
JOHN McCAIN, WAS ASKED WHAT  HE WOULD TEACH COLBERT IF HE  LANDED THE JOB. McCAIN JOKINGLY ANSWERED QUOTE,  "HOW TO SHUT UP." [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: IT'S A JOKE, BECAUSE  HE CLEARLY CAN'T MAKE ANYONE  SHUT UP! [ LAUGHTER ] NOW McCAIN'S WRONG ON ONE POINT. I DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT  THE SENATE. SO HERE NOW TO EDUCATE ME IS MY  FUTURE FORMER COLLEGUE, THE  DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN FROM NEW MEXICO, SENATOR JEFF BINGAMAN. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING  US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR GETTING ME READY FOR THIS  JOB IN JANUARY WHICH IS IMNENT.
TERRIFIC. WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING  YOU HERE. I'LL BE GONE BUT WE'RE GOING  FORWARD TO HAVING YOU HERE  ANYWAY?
ARE YOU LEAVING BECAUSE I'M  COMING?
NO, I WAS PLANNING TO LEAVE  BEFORE YOU ANNOUNCED YOUR PLANS  TO COME.
STEPHEN: WHAT A SHAME. I'LL MISS YOU IN THE STEAM ROOM?
A DEGREE.
STEPHEN: IS THERE A STEAM  ROOM?
THERE IS A STEAM ROOM.
STEPHEN: OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE  SENATE?
WELL IT'S NOT AS EXCITING AS  YOU MIE EXPECT.
STEPHEN: I DON'T EXPECT IT  TO BE EXCITING AT ALL.
YOU'LL FIT RIGHT IN IF YOU  DON'T EXPECT EXCITEMENT HERE. THE WORK HERE IS PRETTY  STRAIGHTFORWARD. YOU TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES  THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE VOTING  ON, AND THAT PRETTY MUCH OCCUPIES THE DAY.
STEPHEN: AND WHAT DO YOU  GET PAID?
$174,000 IS THE CURRENT  SALARY.
STEPHEN: NOT A WEEK, A  YEAR?
THIS IS A YEAR. I KNOW IT DOESN'T COMPARE WHY  YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE.
STEPHEN: $174,000 A YEAR?
THAT'S CORRECT.
STEPHEN: HOW DO YOU LIVE? DO YOU GET FOOD STAMPS?
I DON'T BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I  HAVE A WIFE WHO HAS ALSO BEEN  VERY SUCCESSFUL IN SUPPORTING OUR FAMILY.
STEPHEN: I SHOULD MARRY  RICH?
YOU NEED TO MARRY RICH FOR  YOU.
STEPHEN: GOOD. WE NOTE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  IS A BUNCH OF LOSERS COMPARED TO  YOU GUYS. DO YOU HAVE THE POWER TO WALK UP  TO ANYBODY AND GIVE THEM A  WEDGY?
YEAH, I GUESS I DO.
STEPHEN: IT'S WORTH IT  RIGHT THERE. I'M GOING TO APPOINTED SO I  DON'T HAVE TO RUN BUT TO BE  REELECTED WHO SHOULD I BE BEHOLDEN TO? WHICH LOBBIES SHOULD I LOOK FOR  FOR CASH?
YOU ARE FROM WHICH STATE?
STEPHEN: SOUTH CAROLINA.
FIGURE OUT WHO THE MAJOR  INFLUENCE ARE IN SOUTH CAROLINA  AND ROLL OVER FOR THEM, I WOULD  ASSUME.
STEPHEN: I DO HAVE TO  PHYSICALLY ROLL OVER LIKE A DOG  AND SHOW THEM MY BELLY OR CAN I VOTE THE WAY THEY WANT ME TO?
I THINK THE VOTING IS  ADEQUATE.
STEPHEN: DO YOU GET A  UNIFORM?
NO, YOU DON'T.
STEPHEN: CAN YOU WEAR  ANYTHING ON THE FLOOR?
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO WEAR A  COAT AND TIE.
STEPHEN: DO YOU HAVE TO  BECAUSE I WAS THINKING A UNITARD  OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I THINK YOU HAVE TO CHANGE  THE RULES.
STEPHEN: CAN I ASK YOU  SOMETHING ABOUT JOHN McCAIN  FOR A SECOND?
PLEASE.
STEPHEN: HE HAS EVER TRIED  TO MAKE YOU SHUT UP?
I CAN'T REMEMBER THAT, NO.
STEPHEN: HE SAID HE WOULD  TEACH ME TO SHUT UP.
WELL, YOU HAVE THAT TO LOOK  FORWARD TO, I GUESS. [ LAUGHTER ]
STEPHEN: WHY DO YOU WANT TO  GET RID OF FILIBUSTER AS IT  STANDS NOW AND KEEP IN MIND THAT IF I DO NOT LIKE YOURSELF I'LL  FILIBUSTER IT?
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO  SAY IF FOLKS WANT TO KEEP THE  SENATE FROM PROCEEDING TO VOTE ON SOMETHING, THEY NEED TO  CONTINUE TO TALK OR HAVE ANOTHER  SENATOR THAT WANTS TO TAKE THEIR PLACE AND TALK.
STEPHEN: I'M PERFECTLY  PREPARED FOR THE NEW FILIBUSTER  BECAUSE I HAVE AN OPINION TO SAY ABOUT EVERY ISSUE. I COULD KEEP TALKING ENDLESSLY  AND NOT WORRY ABOUT WHAT I'M  SAYING OR WHAT THE WORDS MEAN. AT THE END OF THE NIGHT WHEN THE  CAMERAS GOOD OFF, I KEEP  TALKING. I HAVE A CATHETER IN AND I'VE  BEEN ON A LIQUID DIET FOR SEVEN  YEARS.
YOU ARE IDEALLY PREPARED TO  SERVE IN THE SENATE.
STEPHEN: ARE YOU LISTENING  GOVERNOR HALEY? THAT'S AN ACTUAL SENATOR TELLING  TO YOU SENATE ME OR SENATIZE ME? WHAT IS THE VERB THERE?
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A VERB.
STEPHEN: THAT'S THE FIRST  THING I'M GOING DHIENG WHEN I  GET TO THE SENATE. SENATOR JEFF BINGAMAN GIVE IT
