(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HOST OF A HISTORY SHOW THAT CONNECTS EVERY EVENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD-- I ASSUME TO KEVIN BACON. PLEASE WELCOME DAVID CHRISTIAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, MR. CHRISTIAN, SO NICE TO HAVE YOU ON. NOW, SIR, YOU ARE THE HOST OF A NEW SHOW THAT'S REALLY MORE THAN A SHOW ON H2 WHICH IS HISTORY CHANNEL 2, I ASSUME.
YUP. YUP.
OKAY. NO ROOM ON THE ACTUAL HISTORY CHANNEL BECAUSE THAT'S FULL OF LIKE PAWN STARS AND AMERICAN PICKERS, I ASSUME. (LAUGHTER) THE SERIES ATTEMPTS TO CONNECT WIDELY DIVERSE THINGS THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND REALLY LET US GET TO KNOW THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE.
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WHAT WE TRY TO DO.
Stephen: FROM THE BIG BANG TO NOW IN TEN HOURS.
THAT'S IT.
Stephen: WHY NOT SOMETHING MORE AMBITIOUS. (LAUGHTER) WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE SERIES?
THE SERIES AND THE COURSE I TEACH AND THE COURSE THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE BIG HISTORY PROJECT --
Stephen: YOU CAN GO TO BIGHISTORY.COM AND ONE OF YOUR BACKERS IS BILL GATES IS YOUR PARTNER IN THIS. HE WANTS EVERYONE TO LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: .
WHAT THE COURSE DOES IS TEACHES YOU THE WHOLE HISTORY OF TIME. SO IT GIVES YOU A SORT OF MAP OF TIME AND SPACE LIKE AN ORIGIN STORY AND THAT MEANS YOU CAN PLACE YOURSELF IN THE UNIVERSE AND IN THE WHOLE OF TIME AND SPACE.
I ALWAYS ASSUMED I'M AT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING IS TURNING AROUND ME. I BELIEVE GALILEO DISCOVERED THAT. (LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE YOU'RE AT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. THE PERSON WHO TELLS THE STORY IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE ALWAYS. BUT YOU NEED TO PLACE YOURSELF IN THAT LARGE MAP AND IF YOU CAN PLACE YOURSELF IN THAT MAP THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF MEANING, OF WHERE YOU ARE, OF HOW YOU CAME TO BE AND WHAT THINGS YOU CAN DO. WHAT POSSIBILITIES ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU.
Stephen: WE ALREADY HAVE THIS KIND OF MAP THAT TELLS US OUR PLACE AND PURPOSE IN THE UNIVERSE. IT'S CALLED THE BIBLE. (LAUGHTER) HAVE YOU READ IT? HAVE YOU READ THE BIBLE? (APPLAUSE)
I HAVE READ IT.
Stephen: NOTHING IN THIS SERIES WILL CONTRADICT WHAT I BELIEVE, CORRECT?
WELL -- (LAUGHTER). THERE ARE MANY ORIGIN STORIES AND THE BIBLE IS ONE.
Stephen: IT'S THE TRUE ONE.
MANY, MANY COUNTRIES AND DIFFERENT SOCIETIES HAVE THEIR OWN ORIGIN STORIES AND MODERN SCIENCIST CONTAINS AN ORIGIN STORY. SO WHAT WE'RE TELLING IS THE OR GIN STORY PRESENT IN MODERN SCIENCE.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CONFUSES ME ABOUT THE SHOW IS IT CONNECTS WIDELY DISPARATE THINGS. LIKE -- GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE THINGS. YOUR FIRST EPISODE IS ABOUT SALT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THE WHOLE EPISODE JUST ABOUT SALT.
YEAH.
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY THAT'S JUST A RATINGS GRAB BECAUSE PEOPLE -- (LAUGHTER). NEXT WEEK IT'S SWEET. SALT AND SWEET.
BUT IF YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT THE EARLY EARTH FOUR BILLION YEARS AGO THE FIRST LIVING ORGANISMS WERE FORMED IN SALTY WATER SO ALL LIVING ORGANISMS ON EARTH WERE FORMED IN THE SORT OF SALT SOLUTION. WE NEED TO CARRY IT AROUND INSIDE OUR BODIES SO THE STORY OF SALT --
Stephen: WAIT, THERE'S A SALT SOLUTION IN MY BODY.
YOU NEED SALT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE SALT I HATE TO SAY IT BUT YOU WILL DIE EVENTUALLY: (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: DON'T EVEN JOKE ABOUT THAT. HAVE WE FOUGHT WARS OVER SALT?
I THINK WARS PROBABLY HAVE BEEN FOUGHT OVER SALT, YEAH. IT'S A CRUCIAL COMMODITY, HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY HAVE BEEN TRADING.
Stephen: WE PEDRO MAN SOLDIERS IN SALT.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT SALARY COMES FROM.
ABSOLUTELY. E YOU ENJOYINGMY HISTORY COURSE?
ABSOLUTELY.
THIS ISN'T LIKE DATE SPACE HISTORY. I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW 1066 OR 476 OR 1492 OR THAT STUFF, DO ANY.
YOU NEED TO KNOW A FEW DATES. I CAN GIVE YOU A FEW.
Stephen: I JUST GAVE YOU A THREE.
13. BILLION YEARS.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED THEN?
THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSE.
Stephen: SAYS YOU, BUT GO AHEAD, YEAH.
4.56 BILLION YEARS AGO THE EARTH WAS CREATED. GREAT THING. 65 MILLION YEARS AGO AN ASS ROEUTD LANDED ON EARTH, WIPED OUT THE DINOSAURS. IF THE DINOSAURS HADN'T BEEN WIPED OUT WE WOULD NOT BE HERE.
Stephen: BECAUSE WE'D BE FIGHTING THEM. (LAUGHTER) WE'D BE FIGHTING THEM, RIGHT! THIS SHOULD BE WOULD BE GLADIATORS FIGHTING DINOSAURS AND ITS RATINGS WOULD BE ENORMOUS. WHAT'S BILL GATES GET OUT OF THIS? WHERE IS HE GETTING HIS BEAK WET? HE LOVES THE CASH.
HE'S NOT GETTING CASH, HE LOVES THE EDUCATIONAL IDEA OF THE COURSE THAT BRINGS THE DIFFERENT SUBJECTS TOGETHER. I MEAN, I REMEMBER GOING TO SCHOOL WANTING TO A STORY ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE AND MY TEACHERS SAY TO ME THINGS LIKE -- AND THIS IS THEIR JOB. THEY SAY "SHUT UP ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE. LEARN ABOUT CALCULUS OR YOUR FRENCH VERBS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS." NEVER COULD I STUDY OR ASK ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE IN SCHOOL OR UNIVERSITY. WITH A COURSE LIKE THIS, YOU CAN PUT ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE TOGETHER, YOU CAN SEE A COHERENT STORY OF THE WHOLE OF THE PAST AND IT'S FULL OF MEANING.
Stephen: WELL, DAVID, WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE?
THE MEANING OF LIFE -- OKAY. UM -- (LAUGHTER). HERE'S THE QUICK VERSION.
Stephen: I KIND OF DO NEED THE QUICK VERSION.
13.8 BILLION YEARS AGO THE UNIVERSE APPEARS. IT'S THAT SMALL, EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE IS IN THAT TINY THING. IT'S INCREDIBLY SIMPLE, NO HUMANS, NO PLANETS, NO ELEMENTS. THEN OVER 13.8 BILLION YEARS ONE BY ONE NEW MORE COMPLEX THINGS APPEAR. STARS APPEAR. PLANETS APPEAR. LIVING ORGANISMS-- AT LEAST ON THIS PLANET-- AND THEN EVENTUALLY US. THE WEIRDEST ORGANISMS OF ALL. SO THAT'S A WONDERFUL STORY ABOUT HOW WE GOT TO BE HERE.
Stephen: THAT'S THE EVENTS OF LIFE, THAT'S NOT THE MEANING OF LIFE.
THE MEANING IS LIKE A MAP. IF YOU HAVE A MAP IT TELLS YOU WHERE YOU ARE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: IF YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GO.
Stephen: IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE KEY SAYS IN THE CORNER OF THE MAP! (LAUGHTER) TO TELL YOU DISTANCE AND EVERYTHING. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE IS. THE BIBLE IS THE KEY IN THE CORNER.
THE BIBLE IS A MAP. IT'S A WONDERFUL MAP, FULL OF MEANING.
Stephen: IT'S THE MAP, MR. CHRISTIAN. (LAUGHTER) DAVID CHRISTIAN, "BIG HISTORY" ON H2 AND ONLINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT B
