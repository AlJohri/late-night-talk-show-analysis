THIS.
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE CHIEF  FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT FOR NBC  NEWS UNTIL JIMMY FALLON TAKES OVER IN 2014. PLEASE WELCOME RICHARD ENGEL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  A IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. YOU ARE THE PEABODY AND EMMY  AWARD-WINNING CHIEF FOREIGN  CORRESPONDENT FOR NBC NEWS. ALSO OF AUTHOR OF TWO BOOKS AND  A RECENT ARTICLE CALLED "THE  HOSTAGE" IN "VANITY FAIR" MAGAZINE, TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU  WERE TAKEN HOSPITAL IN SYRIA. WHERE HAVE YOU JUST COME BACK  FROM?
SOUTH KOREA. I JUST GOT OFF THE PLANE TODAY.
Stephen:  REALLY? HOW DO THEY SEE THE TENSION IN  THE KOREAN PENINSULA? OVER HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT  KIM-- KIM JUNGUN AS LIKE THE  CRAZY COUSIN WHO TALKS, YOU KNOW, WHEN HE COMES TO  THANKSGIVING DINNER AND SAYS,  I'VE GOT NUCLEAR WEAPONS."
I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS.
Stephen:  ARE THEY SCARED  OVER THERE?
ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, NOT AT  ALL. YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY  CASUAL. THEY ARE GOING ABOUT THEIR  BUSINESS. NOTHING WAS CLOSED. CHILDREN WERE GOING TO SCHOOL. OVER THE LONG TERM, THEY'RE VERY  WORRIED. OVER THE LONG TERM THIS IS THE  BIGGEST STRATEGIC THREAT SOUTH  KOREA FACES.
Stephen:  THIS GUY COULD  ACTUALLY PUSH THE BUTTON.
YEAH. THERE ARE NEARLY 30,000 AMERICAN  TROOPS IN THAT COUNTRY NOT FOR  NO REASON. THEY'RE THERE BECAUSE THE NORTH  IS CONSIDERED A THREAT.
Stephen:  HAVE YOU BEEN TO  NORTH KOREA?
I HAVE. THIS TIME LAST YEAR I WAS IN  NORTH KOREA.
Stephen:  IS IT LOVELY? WHAT IS--  ( LAUGHTER )  IT'S SPRINGTIME. WHAT'S IT LIKE?
IT'S LIKE GOING BACK THERE  TIME. YOU'RE GOING BACK TO THE 40s. YOU'RE GOING BACK TO WHAT FEELS  LIKE EASTERN EUROPE OR THE  SOVIET UNION IN THE DAYS OF  STALIN. THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.
Stephen:  DO THEY HATE US? DO THEY REALLY HATE US, LIKE THE  PEOPLE?
NO, THE PEOPLE-- IT'S VERY  DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE WITH  PEOPLE DIRECTLY, BUT I FOUND ABSOLUTELY NO HOSTILITY.
Stephen:  DO YOU SPEAK  KOREAN?
I DON'T SPEAK KOREAN.
Stephen:  THAT COULD BE ONE  THE REASONS WHY. ( LAUGHTER ).
THAT WASN'T THE ONLY REASON. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE  WITH THEM BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET  TIME ALONE WITH THEM. EVERY TIME YOU GO SOMEWHERE  YOU'RE WITH A MINDER. WHEN WE'RE OUT ON THE STREET, IF  YOU WANT TO GO TO FIND A PUBLIC  BATHROOM, THE MINDER WILL WALK YOU, STAND OUTSIDE THE DOOR,  WAIT FOR YOU UNTIL YOU'RE DONE  AND TAKE YOU BACK.
Stephen:  THAT'S BOTH  POLITE AND CREEPY AT THE SAME  TIME.
A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.
Stephen:  FOUR MONTHS AGO  YOU WERE KIDNAPPED IN SYRIA?
IN DECEMBER.
Stephen:  HOW DID YOU GET  AWAY AND WHO KIDNAPPED YOU?
WE WERE EXWOOPPED BY A GROUP  CALLED THE SHABIA, A  PROGOVERNMENT MILITIA.
Stephen:  PRO-ASSAD.
PRO-ASSAD. AND THEY WERE ORGANIZED. THEY WERE VERY TRAINED. THEY WERE WAITING FOR US BY THE  SIDE OF THE ROAD. AS SOON AS THEY SURROUNDED OUR  VEHICLE THEY LOADED US UP INTO A  TRUCK, A CONTAINER TRUCK, AND YOU KNEW THEY WERE  PROFESSIONALS. THEY HAD THEIR WEAPONS READY. THEY HAD FLASH. AS SOON AS THEY CLOSED THE  CONTAINER DOOR IT WENT DARK.
Stephen:  DID THEY KNOW WHO  YOU WERE OR WERE YOU JUST  WESTERNERS?
WE WERE JUST WESTERNERS AND  THEY WERE WITH A REBEL COMMANDER  WE'RE WITH. THEY WERE ORGANIZED. AND WE WERE THERE FOR FIVE DAYS,  AND THEN ON THE-- ON THE THE  FIFTH NIGHT, WE WERE FREED BY A BUNCH OF REBELS WHO WERE LOOKING  FOR US, AND LOOKING FOR THIS  REBEL COMMANDER WHO WAS ALSO  TAKEN. AND THERE WAS A GUNFIGHT, AND  THEY WERE MIEWG US, THE SHABIHA,  TO YET ANOTHER OF THEIR SAFE LOCATIONS, AND THEY HIT A  CHECKPOINT THEY WEREN'T  ANTICIPATING, EXCHANGE OF FIRE. TWO OF THE KIDNAPPERS WERE  KILLED, AND WE GOT OUT OF THE  CAR AT THAT STAGE AND GOT TAKEN  AWAY.
Stephen:  ARE YOU GOING TO  GO BACK? ( LAUGHTER )
I PROBABLY WILL. I WILL, EVENTUALLY.
Stephen:  OKAY--
IT IS A MAJOR STORY.
Stephen:  WHY, WHY WOULD--  LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND, THIS IS  YOUR JOB AND EVERYTHING. BUT WHY ANY TO SUCH DANGEROUS  PLACES, OTHER THAN FOR THE-- FOR  THE AIR MILES OR SOMETHING LIKE  THAT.
IT'S NOT FOR THE AIR MILES. RIGHT NOW SYRIA IS IMPLODING AND  IS IN A STATE OF COLLAPSE. AND THAT IS IMPACTING THE ENTIRE  REGION.
Stephen:  SHOULD THE UNITED  STATES GET MORE INVOLVED WITH  SYRIA?
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THINGS  GETTING MORE INVOLVED MILITARILY  IS A GOOD IDEA. I HAVE SPOKEN TO POLITICIANS AND  THE REBELS. THEY DON'T WANT U.S. TROOPS TO  BE INVOLVE GLD THAT'S SO GREAT. BECAUSE I'M READY TO PUSH THE  FORMAT BUTTON ON MEMORIZING THE  AKU-B-ABADS IN MY HEAD. I CAN'T REMEMBER ANY MORE NAMES  I CAN'T PRONOUNCE.
A LOT OF EUROPEAN STATES, AND  CERTAINLY THE SYRIAN PEOPLE WHO  AREN'T ALIGNED WITH THE GOVERNMENT WANT TO SEE MORE  PRESSURE PUT ON MOSCOW, AND THEY  WANT MORE OF AN ABILITY FOR THE REBELS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THERE IS  SOMETHING OF A VETO IN PLACE BY  U.S. AND OTHER ALLIES TO PREVENT A LOT OF WEAPONS THERE GETTING  IN THERE WITH THE IDEA THAT THAT  WOULD MAKE IT WORSE, BUT IT'S HARD FOR IT TO GET MUCH WORSE.
Stephen:  WHEN DO YOU GO  BACK?
I JUST GOT HERE! YOU'RE SENDING ME OUT AGAIN! I JUST GOT HERE.
Stephen:  HOW LONG ARE YOU  GOING TO SPEND IN THE UNITED  STATES?
NOT VERY LONG.
Stephen:  YOU'RE GOING TO  GO BACK OVERSEAS SOON?
VERY SOON.
Stephen:  THIS IS CALLED  THE BUCKET. YOU PUT ON THE BUCKET, AND JUST  SEND THE OTHER SIDE BACK TO  SYRIA. THINK ABOUT IT?
IT WOULD HAVE MADE THE ESCAPE  A LOT EASIER. YOU JUST TURN IT OFF.
Stephen:  AND YOU'RE GONE. RICHARD ENGEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. STAY SAFE. FROM NBC NEWS, RICHARD ENGEL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
