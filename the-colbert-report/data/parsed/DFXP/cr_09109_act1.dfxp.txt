[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. TEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: WE WILL TOM TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S THE WEATHER, I DON'T KNOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE,  SIT DOWN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. AND WELCOME BACK, ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. YES, I WAS ON BREAK LAST WEEK,  AND, FOLKS, IT WAS GREAT. I FINALLY HAD TIME TO WATCH MY  FAVORITE SHOW, "THE COLBERT  REPORT."  THOUGH I'VE GOT TO SAY AS USUAL IT WAS ALL RE-RUNS. HAPPENS EVERY TIME I'M ON BREAK. WHAT ARE THE ODDS? OF COURSE, FOLKS, WHILE I WAS  AWAY, SOME BIG NEWS HAPPENED. ONE IMAGINES. I DON'T KNOW. AND WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THOSE  STORIES AS SOON AS I CARE. OH, HI! I WAS JUST READING "FUN FACTS  ABOUT WISCONSIN," A BOOK THAT,  LET'S SAY, EXISTS. DID YOU KNOW THAT MANY OF  AMERICA'S WELL KNOWN CITIES ARE  NAMED FOR GREAT LEADERS. YOU'VE GOT WASHINGTON D.C.,  LINCOLN, NEBRASKA; AND  WISCONSIN'S OWN MADISON, NAMED FOR FAMOUS GOTH ROCKER MARILYN  MAD SEN. SAYS SO RIGHT HERE IN, AGAIN,  THIS VERY REAL BOOK. AND MADISON IS NETTALLED IN THE  SUBJECT OF THE 71st  INSTALLMENT OF MY 434-PART  SERIES "BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT." TONIGHT, WISCONSIN'S SECOND, THE  FIGHTIN' SECOND. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MADISON, WISCONSIN, IS FAMOUSLY  ONE OF THE MOST LIBERAL CITIES  IN AMERICA TRAILING ONLY SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, AUSTIN,  TEXAS AND MEAT-IS-MURDER,  OREGON. WISCONSIN SECOND IS ALSO WHERE  THE RINGLING BROTHERS FOUNDED  THEIR FAMOUS RINGLING BROTHERS CIRCUS KNOWN AS THE GREATEST  SHOW ON EARTH BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE  NEVER LEFT WISCONSIN. NOW THE DISTRICT ALSO CONTAINS  PART OF THE BEAUTIFUL WISCONSIN  DELLS, WHERE YOU'LL FIND NOAH'S ARK OFFICIALLY AMERICA'S LARGEST  WATER PARK AND UNOFFICIALLY  AMERICA'S LARGEST OPEN-AIRPORT A  POTTY. AND... TRUE. ANYONE FOR A STAPH INFECTION. STEP RIGHT UP. AND WHO HAS THE BUCKIE BADGERS  TO REPRESENT SUCH A DISTRICT? IT'S NONE OTHER THAN FRESHMAN  DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN MARK  POCAN. I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE  POCAN IN HIS WASHINGTON OFFICE. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
THANK YOU. IT'S AN HONOR.
IS IT PO-KIN. POCAN. LIKE THE NUT. CAN I CALL YOU POKEY? OAKY DOAKY CONGRESSMAN POKEY. LET'S GET TO IT. FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON  YOUR FIRST 100 DAYS IN CONGRESS.
THANK YOU. I'VE GOT TO SHOW YOU  SOMETHING.
AWESOME. Stephen: BLOW IT OUT. MAKE A WISH. TAKE THAT ONE. AND THAT ONE.
GREAT. THANK YOU.
Stephen: MAKE A WISH. BREAK THAT IN HALF. PUT IT UNDER YOUR PILLOW AND IN  THE MORNING YOU'LL HAVE A WAXY  PILLOW. OKAY.
I SAW THIS. THIS WAS FANTASTIC. THIS IS YOU BEING SWORN IN,  CORRECT?
ABSOLUTELY. Stephen: ANY TEARS? ANY TEARS WHEN YOU WERE SWORN  IN?
NO. IT WAS JUST A REAL HONOR TO BE  SWORN IN.
DID BOEHNER CRY? HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T. Stephen: HE CRIES A LOT. SO NICE THAT YOUR YOUNG NEPHEW  COULD BE THERE WITH YOU.
THAT'S MY HUSBAND, PHIL. Stephen: I'M SORRY. THAT'S MY HUSBAND, PHIL. Stephen: YOU ARE GAY? YES. Stephen: WHY? IT'S JUST WHO I AM. IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE BORN.
Stephen: NO, I WAS BORN  STRAIGHT. I WAS NOT BORN GAY. YOU SAY YOU WERE BORN GAY.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GAY. Stephen: BUT YOU THOUGHT I  WAS. YOU GUESSED. I ASSUME YOU SUPPORT FEDERAL  RECOGNITION OF GAY MARRIAGE  UNTIL YOUR HUSBAND FORGETS TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE, AM I  RIGHT? MEN! CAN'T LIVE WITH THEM. LEGALLY CAN'T LIVE WITH THEM IN  SOME STATES.
THAT'S A PROBLEM. Stephen: WHAT IS IT ABOUT MY  GOD-SANCTIONED MARRIAGE THAT YOU  MOST WANT TO DESTROY?
NOTHING. IN FACT...
Stephen: YOU ARE. YOU'RE HARMING IT.
I'VE HARMED YOUR MARRIAGE. Stephen: YOU HAVE. IN WHAT WAY. Stephen: BECAUSE IF I COULD  HAVE GOTTEN GAY-MARRIED, WHY  WOULDN'T I HAVE DONE THAT  INSTEAD? GUYS ARE GREAT.
WELL, YOU COULD GET DIVORCED  POTENTIALLY AND MARRY A MAN IF  THAT'S...
Stephen: NOW YOU'RE  SUGGESTING THAT I GET DIVORCED,  AND YOU SAY YOU'RE NOT DESTROYING MY MARRIAGE.
YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN DIVORCED. Stephen: BUT YOU JUST TEMPTED  ME WITH THAT. YOU SHOULD GET DIVORCED.
I'M NOT TEMPTING YOU. Stephen: I'M NOT TEMPTED AT  ALL. BECAUSE I'M NOW MARRIED. I BELIEVE IN THE OATH I TOOK. THE OATH TO BE MARRIED, AND I  AM. OKAY. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT  THAT NOW. AS A FRESHMAN CONGRESSMAN, YOU  DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A RECORD FOR  ME TO ATTACK YET.
THAT'S GREAT. Stephen: WHAT ARE SOME OF THE  THINGS YOU WOULD LIKE TO  ACCOMPLISH SO I CAN ATTACK IT?
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE  PROVIDING ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE  FOR ALL OF OUR PEOPLE.
Stephen: YOU MEAN OBAMA CARE. THE ACT, RIGHT. Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN PLACED  ON A DEATH PANEL YET?
NO, THERE'S NO DEATH PANELS. Stephen: WHEN DOES THAT  START.
THERE WON'T BE ANY. Stephen: HAVE YOU READ ALL OF  OBAMA CARE.
NO. Stephen: YOU ADMIT YOU DON'T  KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE DEATH  PANELS.
THERE ARE NOT DEATH PANELS. I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE  READ.
Stephen: MAYBE THEY'RE ON THE  DEATH PANELS AND THEY DON'T WANT  TO TELL YOU BECAUSE THEY'VE SAID WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU HEALTH  CARE AND PUT YOU TO DEATH. THE PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH  OBAMA CARE WHEN THEY GO TO THE  HOSPITAL INSTEAD TAKE THEM OFF TO THE HUNGER GAMES AND THEY  FIGHT.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S IN THE  BILL.
Stephen: YOU DON'T THINK SO  BUT YOU DON'T KNOW.
I'M SURE IT'S NOT IN THE  BILL.
Stephen: LET'S AGREE TO  DISAGREE. DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT? OKAY. THIS NEXT SUBJECT TOUCHY. IT MIGHT DISTURB SOME VIEWERS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU  USED TO BE A MAGICIAN.
YEAH, I PAID FOR COLLEGE  DOING IMAGINE IB SHOWS AND BAR  TENDING.
Stephen: HOW LONG WERE YOU  TURNING TRICKS? (INAUDIBLE).
Stephen: WHY DID YOU STOP? I GOT A JOB. I STARTED A BUSINESS. AND I GOT REAL BUSY.
Stephen: WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN  D.C. YOU WORK AT YOUR  SIGN-MAKING STORE WITH PHIL-FRANK WHO IS YOUR PARTNER.
MY HUSBAND. Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE A  BUSINESS PARTNER NAMED BILL  FRANK.
HE'S MY HUSBAND. Stephen: SO BUSINESS PARTNER  IS CODE FOR... DO YOU HAVE TO  GET MARRIED TO YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER IN WISCONSIN?
NO. Stephen: THAT WAS A CHOICE. NO. Stephen: OKAY. IS YOUR GAY BUSINESS PARTNER OR  JUST YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER.
JUST MY BUSINESS PARTNER. Stephen: THAT PART IS NOT  GAY.
NO. Stephen: SO IT IS A CHOICE  WHEN YOU ARE GAY AND WHEN YOU'RE  NOT.
THE CHOICE TO BE BUSINESS  PARTNER IS NOT A CHOICE TO BE  GAY.
Stephen: THE STORY FALLING  APART A BIT HERE.
NO IT'S NOT. Stephen: IN 1992 YOU  SUPPORTED A BAN ON BEAR  WRESTLING. YOU USED TO BRING BEARS INTO  COLISEUM AND THEY WOULD GET KIND  OF DRUGGED UP AND THEN SOME PERSON FROM THE AUDIENCE WOULD  ATTEMPT TO WRESTLE THAT BEAR.
Stephen: WE SHOULDN'T DRUG  THEM WHEN THEY WRESTLE. THEY DON'T HAVE A CHANCE. SHOULD WE GIVE THEM KNIVES? HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO FIGHT  PEOPLE.
WE COULD JUST LEAVE BEARS  ALONE.
Stephen: BUT THEY STARTED IT. I DON'T THINK SO. Stephen: LAST QUESTION: TELL  ME ABOUT YOUR DISTRICT.
IT'S JUST AN EXCEPTIONAL  PLACE. ALL OF SOUTH CENTRAL WISCONSIN  IS AN EXCEPTIONAL PLACE TO LIVE. MADISON IS OUR CAPITAL CITY OF  THE STATE.
Stephen: I LOVE THE FARMERS  MARKET IN MADISON. CHEESE CURDS, WHICH, NO OFFENSE,  THE GAY IS CHEESE, RIGHT?
IT'S A VERY POPULAR CHEESE. Stephen: THEY SQUEAK WHEN YOU  BITE 'EM, JUST LIKE GAY PEOPLE  DO. WHEN YOU BITE A GAY PERSON THEY  SQUEAK.
I THINK ANYONE WOULD SQUEAK. Stephen: I'VE NEVER BITTEN  ANYBODY BUT GAY PEOPLE. CONGRESSMAN, THANK SO MUCH FOR  TALKING TO ME TODAY.
THANK YOU. Stephen: LET'S PUT WISCONSIN  UP ON THE BOARD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE JUST GOT  BIT RIGHT ON THE CHEESE CURDS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
