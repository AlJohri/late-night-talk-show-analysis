(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BLACK,  EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PULITZER  PRIZE PLAY WRIGHT. TONY KUSHNER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, THANKS  FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU. TURN AUTHOR OF "THE PLAYWRIGHT  OF ANGELS IN AMERICA."  YOU ALSO WROTE THE SCREENPLAY TO "MUNICH" WITH STEPHEN SPIELBERG  NOW YOU ARE THE SCREEN WRITEER  FOR THE KNEW MOVIE "LINCOLN." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WERE YOU DAUNTED AT ALL  APPROACHING A FIGURE THIS  ICONIC? SOMEONE SO HUGE IN OUR MINDS? SOMEONE WE ALL THINK OF AS OLD. OLD UNCLE PENNY FACE? (LAUGHTER)
NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO THINK  OF HIM AS OLDS UNCLE PENNY FACE. IT WAS SCARY. I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT ORIGINAL  BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT  WAS GOING TO BE POSSIBLE.
Stephen: DID SPIELBERG HAVE  SOMETHING ON YOU? DID HE BLACKMAIL YOU?
WELL, DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN  WHO'S BEEN ON THE SHOW.
Stephen: FRIEND OF THE SHOW.
SHE WAS A VERY PERSUASIVE AND  LOVELY PERSON AND GREAT WRITER  AND SHE TALKED ME INTO IT AND I LOVED WORKING WITH STEVEN ON  "MUNICH" SO I FIGURED IT WAS A  GOOD THING TO TRY.
Stephen: WHEN DORIS WAS ON  SHE SAID SOMETHING I HADN'T  HEARD BEFORE. SHE SAID -- SHE LOOKED AT  "LINCOLN" AND SHE SAID "ISN'T HE  SEXY?"  SHE SAID SHE'S BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS LINCOLN IS SEXY AND PEOPLE  THINK SHE'S CRAZY. YOU MUST HAVE -- YOU MUST HAVE  GOT TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE  MAN AS YOU WERE RESEARCHING HIM.
SURE.
Stephen: IS HE SEXY?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. HE HAD HUGE FEET. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, HE WAS A KENTUCKY RAIL  SPLITTER. (LAUGHTER)
YEAH, I FELT THAT HE WAS -- I  FELT THAT HE WAS VERY PHYSICALLY  ATTRACTIVE MAN AND -- (LAUGHTER)  AND CLEARLY AN ENORMOUSLY  CHARMING PERSON.
Stephen: AND DANIEL  DAY-LEWIS' PORTRAYAL. I SAW THE SHOW THIS WEEKEND  BECAUSE I'M SUPERSPECIAL AND --  (LAUGHTER)  -- IT'S AN INCREDIBLE MOVIE. FIRST OF ALL, IT'S ESSENTIALLY  ABOUT PASSING A PIECE OF  LEGISLATION. IT'S ABOUT PASSING THE 13th  AMENDMENT WHICH OUTLAWS SLAVERY,  MAKES IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL. HOW DO YOU APPROACH MAKING --  PASSING A PIECE OF LEGISLATION,  PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE,  EXCITING. (LAUGHTER)  DID YOU SUCCEED?
THANKS. I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE A STATE  BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT MOVIE. YOU KNOW THE LITTLE TEAM IS  GOING TO WIN THE STATE  CHAMPIONSHIP. SO YOU KNOW THE ENDING ALREADY  BUT IT'S STILL EXCITING BECAUSE  IT'S -- YOU'RE ROOTING FOR THEM AND IF IT'S A CLOSE CALL YOU --  YOUR ENGINE GETS GOING. SO THIS WAS A SQUEAKER. THE HOUSE PASSED IT BY ONLY TWO  VOTES.
Stephen: RIGHT AT THE BUZZER.
RIGHT AT THE BUZZER,  ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: BECAUSE THE CIVIL  WAR IS ABOUT TO END.
THE CIVIL WAR WAS A FEW  MONTHS AWAY FROM ENDING. LINCOLN KNEW IT WAS GOING TO  COME TO AN END AS SOON AS SPRING  ARRIVED AND THE ARMY STARTED FIGHTING AGAIN.
Stephen: RIGHT. OR IF THE WAR ENDED, YOU KNOW,  PEOPLE "LET'S END SLAVERY WHILE  WE'RE FIGHTING TO END SLAVERY." BUT IF THE WAR ENDS AND WE STILL  HAVE SLAVES SCREW 'EM. (LAUGHTER)
THAT WAS CONSIDERED THE  ATTITUDE.
Stephen: WE'RE GOT TO TAKE A  COMMERCIAL BREAK BUT STAY RIGHT  THERE, WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE TONY KUSHNER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
