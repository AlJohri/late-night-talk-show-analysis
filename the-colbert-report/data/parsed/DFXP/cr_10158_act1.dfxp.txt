(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
STEPHEN: WHOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US! YOU CAN FEEL IT, YOU CAN FEEL IT. THE PRIDE IS BACK. IT'S MORNING IN AMERICA, IT'S A NEW DAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! PLEASE, SIT DOWN! NATION, IT IS A GREAT DAY! THIS IS A GREAT DAY TO BE AN AMERICAN! DADDY IS REVVED UP! IF YOU COULD SEE ME FROM THE WAIST DOWN, I'D BE ARRESTED. (LAUGHTER) JIMMY, TELL 'EM WHY.
WE ARE GETTING BREAKING NEWS LIVE RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE REPORTS THAT MILITARY OPERATIONS IN SYRIA HAVE BEGUN.
THE U.S. AND A COALITION OF FIVE ARAB ALLIES LEADING AIRSTRIKES IN SYRIA USING BOMBERS AND DRONES AND MISSILES.
THE ATTACKS DESTROYING OR DAMAGING MULTIPLE TARGETS, INCLUDING TRAINING COMPOUNDS, HEADQUARTERS, AND COMMAND AND CONTROL FACILITIES.
STEPHEN: YES, AMERICA IS BRINGING THE HAMMER DOWN ON I.S.I.S. TO DRIVE THEM OUT OF SYRIA AND HAND THAT COUNTRY BACK TO ITS RIGHTFUL LEADER. OH, (BLEEP). RIGHT, THIS GUY, OKAY. WELL THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE WHO CAN HOLD THAT REGION TOGETHER. ANYONE SEEN SADDAM LATELY? OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT... THE SPIDER HOLE AND THE BEARD AND THE -- (POP NOISE) WELL, LIVE AND LEARN. THAT'S ONE ON US. POINT IS, SYRIA IS A COUNTRY WE'VE NEVER BOMBED BEFORE -- WHICH MEANS I GET TO PUT A NEW HOLE IN MY MIDEAST FREQUENT BOMBING CARD! (PUNCH CARD) WE'VE ALREADY BOMBED AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, PAKISTAN, YEMEN, SOMALIA AND LIBYA. NOW SYRIA. (PUNCH) ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BOMB OMAN, AND I GET A FREE FALAFEL! OF COURSE, AS MUCH AS I LOVE TURNING A NEW CORNER OF THE DESERT INTO THE BOOM BOOM ROOM, THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS STORY THAT MAKES ME WONDER IF WE RUSHED INTO BATTLE TOO FAST, BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT -- THE NETWORK GRAPHICS PACKAGES WERE JUST NOT READY. COME ON! WE'RE DROPPING BOMBS ON SYRIA AND THE "TODAY SHOW" IS USING THE SAME LOWER-THIRD GRAPHIC THEY USED TO REPORT THAT 50 CENT CAN'T THROW A BASEBALL?! AMERICA IS AT WAR, IT IS THE SWORN DUTY OF THE NEWS BIZ TO CALL ON THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST IN OUR GRAPHICS DEPARTMENTS TO SERVE THEIR NATION. JIMMY, LET'S LOCK AND LOAD!
STEPHEN, IT'S NOT DONE. THE SOUND'S NOT ON IT YET.
STEPHEN: JIMMY, YOU GO TO WAR WITH THE GRAPHICS YOU HAVE, NOT THE GRAPHICS YOU WANT. I'LL WORRY ABOUT THE SOUND. JUICE IT! (STEPHEN MAKES MUSIC AND EXPLOSIONS WITH HIS MOUTH) "AIRSTRIKES ON TERROR:  SYRIA'S BUSINESS:  SHOVE IT UP THEIR I.S.I.L.! BOOM!" (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S NOT JUST AMERICA AND THE ARABS DROPPING THE BOMBS. OUR CLOSEST ALLY, FRANCE, IS BATTLING I.S.I.S. WITH SOMETHING MORE POWERFUL, NAME CALLING. THEY'VE DITCHED I.S.I.S., I.S.I.L. AND THE ISLAMIC STATE AND ARE NOW CALLING THE GROUP DAISH. AS IN, "THESE GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF DAISH-BAGS". THE NAME DAISH COMES FROM THE ARAB ACRONYM FOR "ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND THE LEVANT," AL-DAWLA AL-ISLAMIYA FI AL-IRAQ WA AL-SHAM WHICH JUST PROVES THE OLD SAYING "STICKS AND STONES MAY BREAK MY BONES, BUT I CAN'T PRONOUNCE THAT NAME." AND FRANCE IS CALLING THEM "DAISH" BECAUSE "THE GROUP IS REPORTED TO HATE THE MONIKER." SO MUCH THAT "THEY WERE THREATENING TO CUT OUT THE TONGUES OF ANYONE WHO USED THE PHRASE PUBLICLY." OOOOH! SEE ME SHAKE, DAISH? YOU ARE GOING DOWN! OR MY NAME'S NOT JIMMY FALLON! WRITE IT DOWN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW FOLKS, AS YOU KNOW, I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO HUNTING THE ELUSIVE BIGFOOT. FINDING THIS NOBLE CRYPTID WOULD PROVIDE ANSWERS TO SO MANY UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS -- IS NATURE TRULY KNOWABLE? WHAT ARE THE ORIGINS OF MAN? WHAT WINE PAIRS BEST WITH SASQUATCH MEAT? (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THE LEGEND OF BIGFOOT BEGAN IN THE SUBJECT OF THE 79TH INSTALLMENT OF MY 434-PART SERIES, BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT. TONIGHT:  CALIFORNIA'S SECOND. THE FIGHTIN' SECOND! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE SECOND IS HOME TO THE LARGEST MARIJUANA FARMING REGION IN THE UNITED STATES. THE SO-CALLED "EMERALD TRIANGLE" EARNS A BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE PROFIT IS SPENT ON THE "ORANGE" TRIANGLE. EVERY JULY, THE SECOND HOSTS THE SECRET RETREAT FOR THE POWER ELITE KNOWN AS BOHEMIAN GROVE, WHERE EVERYONE FROM ROBERT OPPENHEIMER TO RONALD REAGAN HAS GONE TO SKINNY DIP AND PRACTICED QUASI-PAGAN RITUALS. TO THIS DAY, WOMEN ARE PROHIBITED FROM ATTENDING. SORRY, LADIES -- YOU MISSED YOUR CHANCE TO SEE RICHARD NIXON PLAY NAKED HORSESHOES. (LAUGHTER) THE SECOND IS ALSO WHERE YOU WILL FIND GEORGE LUCAS' PRODUCTION STUDIO "SKYWALKER RANCH," NAMED AFTER HIS ICONIC "STAR WARS" CHARACTER  LUKE RANCH. (LAUGHTER) AND WHO HAS THE FURRY EWOKS TO REPRESENT THIS DISTRICT? IT'S NONE OTHER THAN CONGRESSMAN JARED HUFFMAN. I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE HUFFMAN IN HIS WASHINGTON OFFICE. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING WITH ME TODAY.
THANK YOU, STEVEN.
STEPHEN: TELL ME ABOUT THE FIGHTING SECOND.
IT GOES FROM THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE IN THE SOUTH TO THE OREGON BORDER, GOT A THIRD OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST, BEAUTIFUL COASTAL COMMUNITIES. IT'S GOT THE BIGGEST AND OLDEST TREES IN THE WORLD.
STEPHEN: YOU GUYS HAVE THE BRISTLECONE PINES?
WE PROBABLY HAVE-- WE HAVE LOTS OF PINES.
STEPHEN: THOSE ARE THE OLDEST TREES IN THE WORLD.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT ONE. ANCIENT REDWOOD.
STEPHEN: DID I CATCH YOU IN A LIE? >>I DON'T THINK SO.
STEPHEN: CAN WE CHECK ON THAT, PLEASE?
REACHING AN AGE OF 5,000 YEARS, BRISTLECONE PINES ARE THE WORLD'S OLDEST LIVING ORGANISMS. BUT CONTRAST, 2ND DISTRICT'S ANCIENT REDWOODS, WHILE MAJESTIC ARE A SPRY 1,000 YEARS OLD. AND KNOW BACK TO OUR "BETTER KNOWING" ALREADY IN PROGRESS.
THIS IS NEWS TO ME.
STEPHEN: YOU SAY YOU'VE NEVER LOST A TRIAL, CORRECT, OR AN ELECTION.
SO FAR.
STEPHEN: HAVE YOU EVER LOST IN AN INTERVIEW, SIR?
I MAY LOSE ONE YET, WE'LL SEE.
STEPHEN: BRACE YOURSELF. GEORGE LUCAS' SKY WALKER RANCH IS IN YOUR DISTRICT.
ABSOLUTELY.
STEPHEN: WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON HAN SHOOTING FIRST?
I'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION, DOES HAN HAVE THE RIGHT TO SHOOT FIRST?
DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
STEPHEN: LET'S SEE YOU OWED A LOT OF MONEY TO JABBA, OKAY, AND YOU KNEW THAT GREEDO WOULD TAKE YOU AWAY  TO BE FROZEN IN CARBONNITE.
I WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO GIVE LEGAL ADVICE TO ANYONE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.
STEPHEN: THIS WAS A LONG TIME AWAY IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY. BUT HAN WAS STANDING HIS GROUND.
I'M NOT A FAN OF SHOOTING FIRST.
STEPHEN: HAN CAN'T SHOOT FIRST. INTERESTING. I SEE YOU LISTED YOUR RELIGION AS UNSPECIFIED.
YES.
STEPHEN: WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPECIFY TO ROMAN CATHOLIC?
NO, I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST CATHOLICS AND I LOVE YOUR NEW POPE.
STEPHEN: UNSPECIFIED, GROW A PAIR. ARE YOU AN ATHEIST?
I DON'T KNOW.
STEPHEN: AGNOSTIC THEN?
PERHAPS.
STEPHEN: WHAT IS AN GNOSTIC BUT AN ATHEIST WITHOUT ANY BALLS? SEE, YOU'RE CHOOSING NOT TO SPECIFY YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT. UNSPECIFIED. I'LL JUST PUT YOU DOWN FOR HEATHEN/HELLBOUND. >>DID I JUST LOSE A POINT?
STEPHEN: THE JUDGES HAVEN'T GOTTEN BACK TO ME YET. DURING YOUR TIME IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY, YOU PASSED A BAN ON THE POSSESSION OR SALE OF SHARK FINS FOR SOUP.
YES.
STEPHEN: WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO CURRY FAVOR FOR SHARKS?
WELL, I'M TRYING TO PROTECT THE WORLD'S SHARK POPULATIONS --
STEPHEN: YOU WANT OUR CHILDREN TO BE DRAGGED THROUGH THE SURF LIKE CHUM. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE DOCUMENTARY "JAWS?"
IT'S NOT A DOCUMENTARY BUT--
STEPHEN: A NEWS REPORT. I'M NOT IN YOUR BUSINESS.
MUCH GREATER RISK OF DYING FROM A BEE STING THAN A SHARK ATTACK.
STEPHEN: WHAT ABOUT BEE SOUP.
I LIKE BEES, TOO. I'M BIG ON POLLINATORS.
STEPHEN: WE KILL BEES FOR THE HONEY.
WE DON'T REALLY KILL BEES FOR THE HONEY.
STEPHEN: DO YOU KEEP BEES?
NO.
STEPHEN: THEN WE BOTH DON'T KNOW. POINT FOR EACH OF US. WE'RE EVEN RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE GOOD. I THOUGHT I WOULD WIN THIS INTERVIEW.
I'M HANGING IN THERE.
STEPHEN: YOU REALLY ARE. WHAT IS IT ABOUT SHARKS THAT YOU LIKE SO MUCH, THAT THEY ATTACK US OR THAT THEY EAT DOLPHINS, WHICH ARE BEAUTIFUL AND INTELLIGENT?
THEY REALLY DON'T EVEN EAT SO MANY DOLPHINS.
STEPHEN: THEY FIGHT THEM, THOUGH, THEY FIGHT THEM
WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT --
STEPHEN: HERE IN CONGRESS, YOU INTRODUCE LEGISLATION ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF KILLER WHALES. KILLER WHALES, KILLER SHARKS. NEXT, HAMMERHEADS?
WELL, THOSE ARE A TYPE OF SHARKS.
STEPHEN: WELL, FOR SOMEONE NOT CURRYING TO SHARKS, YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT THEM. BY THE WAY HAVE YOU EVER HAD CURRIED SHARK?
NO.
STEPHEN: OH INCREDIBLE. DON'T KNOCK IT TIL YOU'VE TRIED IT.
I DON'T THINK SO.
STEPHEN: LET'S MOVE ON. SO YOU SAY THERE'S A WATER SHORTAGE.
CORRECT. ONE OF THE WORST DROUGHTS CALIFORNIA HAS EVER SEEN, SO WE ARE GOING THROUGH A VERY DRY SUMMER AND THE CULMINATION OF REALLY THREE CONSECUTIVE DROUGHT YEARS.
STEPHEN: INSTEAD OF RUNNING AROUND, YOU KNOW, LIKE CHICKEN LITTLE SAYING THE SKY IS FALLING, CONSIDER THIS -- THE ARCTIC ICE SHEET AND THE ANTARCTIC ICE SHEETS, THEY'RE BREAKING UP.
THERE IS NO ARCTIC ICE SHEET.
STEPHEN: ANYMORE?
NEVER WAS. THAT'S THE NORTH POLE.
STEPHEN: THERE'S SOMETHING UP THERE.
NO, NOT AS MUCH AS THERE USED TO BE.
STEPHEN: THERE'S SOMEPLACE FOR SANTA. I'M SAYING RIGHT NOW ON CAMERA. SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN YOUR DISTRICT DON'T KNOW ABOUT -- SO THERE'S AN ICE SHEET FOR SANTA TO LIVE ON, ISN'T THERE?
THERE MUST BE.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU. I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY. YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE CONGRESSIONAL WINE CAUCUS.
YES.
STEPHEN: ISN'T THAT JUST EVERYDAY ON CAPITOL HILL AFTER 5:00?
NO, WE GET TOGETHER ONCE IN A WHILE BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
STEPHEN: DOES THE WINE CAUCUS EVER GET TOGETHER WITH THE CHEESE CAUCUS?
NO, BUT I AM PART OF THE CHEESE CAUCUS, TOO.
STEPHEN: REALLY?
YEAH.
STEPHEN: IS THERE A CRACKER CAUCUS?
I'M NOT AWARE OF THE CRACKER CAUCUS.
STEPHEN: I THINK THE CRACKER CAUCUS IS JUST THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN PARTY. (LAUGHTER) CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY! LET'S PUT CALIFORNIA SECOND UP ON THE BIG BOARD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OOH, LOOKS LIKE THEY JUST BLEW UP THE DEATH STAR AGAIN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
