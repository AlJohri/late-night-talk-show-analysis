(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT"! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. SETTLE DOWN HERE! THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE! THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CHAOS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I NEED YOUR ENERGY. I NEED IT TO FIGHT INJUSTICE, TO FIGHT THE BASTARDS OUT THERE. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I'LL TELL YOU I NEED THAT KIND OF ENERGY TONIGHT PARTICULARLY BECAUSE, FOLKS, THIS JOB IS HARD. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T WANT TO BRING YOU DEPRESSING STORIES NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I AM SO HAPPY TO FINALLY HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS TO REPORT. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS CAN'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE. (LAUGHTER) THE OBAMACARE WEB SITE IS A DISASTER AND I AM LOVING IT! (LAUGHTER) MORE TECHNO-TURD TACO WILL BE BARACK OBAMA'S TRUE LEGACY. IT'S HIS GETTYSBURG ADDRESS-- IF LINCOLN HAD SAID "FOURSCORE AND ERROR 404 EMANCIPATION NOT FOUND." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, I GUESS IT'S NOT HIS ENTIRE LEGACY. HE'LL INDUSTRIAL THE BEER SUMMIT AND HIS ALL YOU CAN KILL ROBOT BUFFET. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I'M NOT SURPRISED IT AIN'T WORKING. THIS WEB SITE RELIES ON SEPARATELY DESIGNED SAY DATABASES AND SOFTWARE FROM 55 DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS. GETTING THAT MANY PEOPLE TO WORK TOGETHER IS LIKE HERDING CATS. (LAUGHTER) ALSO, SOME OF THE CONTRACTORS WERE CATS. (LAUGHTER) AND BRACE YOURSELVES, FOLKS, THE LEAD CONTRACTOR IS FROM AMERICA'S ANCIENT NEMESIS CANADA. (AUDIENCE REACTS) NOW, BY CANADIAN LAW WE MUST ALSO THEY IN FRENCH. CAN-DA! (LAUGHTER) NOW, THE COMPANY BEHIND WEB SITE GATE IS MONTREAL-BASED CONSEILLERS EN GESTION ET ANFORMASTIC. (LAUGHTER) EXCUSE ME, I BELIEVE I JUST ORDERED AN $80 CHEESE. AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO DIAGNOSED OBAMACARE WITH A TERMINAL CASE OF BLOW CHUNKAGE. (LAUGHTER) SO DID PRESIDENT OBAMA CARE.
THERE'S NO SHULAR COATING IT. THE WEB SITE HAS BEEN TOO SLOW, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GETTING STUCK DURING THE APPLICATION PROCESS, WE'VE HAD SOME OF THE BEST I.T. TALENT IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY JOIN THE TEAM AND WE'RE WELL INTO A TECH SURGE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.
Stephen: YES, A TECH SURGE! JUST LIKE OUR AFGHAN SURGE. (LAUGHTER) WHICH MEANS WE'LL ALMOST HAVE IT FIXED IN 12 YEARS. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) AND, AND, IT WILL BE A GREAT PLACE TO BUY HEROINE. BUT IF YOU STILL CAN'T SIGN UP ONLINE, DON'T WORRY, THE NAPOLEON OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS HAS A PLAN TO WIN THIS WELFARE WATERLOO.
WHILE THE WEB SITE WILL ULTIMATELY BE THE EASIEST WAY TO BUY INSURANCE THROUGH THE MARKETPLACE, IT ISN'T THE ONLY WAY. YOU CAN ALSO APPLY IN PERSON WITH THE HELP OF LOCAL NAVIGATORS. THESE ARE PEOPLE SPECIALLY TRAINED TO HELP YOU SIGN UP FOR HEALTH CARE.
Stephen: YEAH, HEALTH CARE NAVIGATORS. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR, WHICH IS EVIDENTLY WHAT healthcare.gov IS RUN ON. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) NOW, FOLKS, THE SETUP -- TO SETUP THESE NAVIGATORS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS REACHED OUT TO ESTABLISHED COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE FOOD BANKS. JOINING ME NOW AS I VISIT ONE OF THESE HEALTH CARE HOUSES OF HORROR IN -- "STEPHEN COLBERT'S I TRIED TO SIGN UP FOR OBAMACARE." (CACKLING) FIRST, I HEADED TO THE MONMOUTH COUNTY FOOD BANK WHERE I MET WITH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CARLOS RODRIGUEZ.
WELCOME TO THE FOOD BANK.
Stephen: SO WE'RE IN AN INDUSTRIAL KITCHEN TO SIGN UP FOR OBAMACARE. BREAK THAT DOWN FOR ME. HOW DOES THAT WORK?
THIS IS ONE PART OF THE FOOD BANK WHERE WE PROVIDE MEALS FOR OVER 10,000 CHILDREN A YEAR.
Stephen: JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU'RE NOT A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER OF ANY KIND.
THAT'S CORRECT.
Stephen: EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE COME TO YOU FOR OBAMACARE AND SOUP.
I AM NOT A DR. .
Stephen: NOR ARE YOU A CHEF?
I AM NOT A CHEF.
Stephen: OKAY. IS OBAMACARE LIMITED TO PEOPLE WHO CAN ACCESS IT?
OBAMACARE IS ONLY LIMITED TO THOSE WHO WANT IT AND WHO ARE ELIGIBLE.
Stephen: HOW DO I SIGN UP?
YOU CAN SIGN UP THREE DIFFERENT WAYS: ONLINE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF NAVIGATORS.
Stephen: WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER?
WE HAVE AN APPLICATION WE CAN HELP YOU FILL OUT.
Stephen: WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE A PEN? (LAUGHTER)
WE CAN PROVIDE ONE FOR YOU.
Stephen: MY PROBLEM IS THAT I DON'T HAVE HANDS.
WE CAN HELP YOU FILL OUT THE APPLICATION.
Stephen: I CAN'T HEAR. WHAT IF I CAN'T HEAR?
WE WILL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS COMPLETED.
Stephen: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WHAT KIND OF INVASIVE QUESTIONS WILL YOU BE ASKING ME TO NAVIGATE ME THROUGH THE PROCESS IN WILL YOU WANT TO KNOW THE SIZE OF MY PROSTATE?
I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW THE SIZE OF YOUR PROSTATE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: IT'S IMPRESSIVE.
CONGRATULATIONS.
Stephen: DON'T YOU THINK BEST IDEA FOR OBAMACARE AT THIS POINT IS JUST TO DEFUND IT? BECAUSE THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT IF IT DIDN'T EXIST.
WHAT WILL WE TELL THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN NEED OF HEALTH CARE AND THIS IS REALLY THE ONLY OPTION BEFORE THEM?
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM BEFORE?
THERE WAS NOTHING AVAILABLE BEFORE NOW THERE'S SOMETHING AVAILABLE AND WE WANT TO GET THEM ENROLLED.
Stephen: I WOULD GO BACK TO THE "THERE'S NOTHING AVAILABLE." I WOULD BE HONEST OTHERWISE WE'D BE LYING. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A LIAR, DO YOU, CAR SFLOS
WE DON'T DO THAT HERE.
Stephen: HAVE YOU SIGNED UP FOR OBAMACARE?
I HAVE NOT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE NOT?
WE PROVIDE OUR EMPLOYEES FOR HEALTH CARE.
Stephen: INTERESTING, SO IT'S GOOD FOR THE LITTLE PEOPLE BUT NOT CARLOS RODRIGUEZ.
IF WE EVER NEEDED OBAMACARE AND IT WASN'T PROVIDED BY MY EMPLOYER I WOULD ENROLL.
Stephen: I'M A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS CATHOLIC AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN CONTRACEPTION. CAN YOU GUARANTEE ME THE MONEY THAT I GAVE OBAMACARE WILL NOT GO TO PROVIDE CONTRACEPTION FOR SLUTS? (LAUGHTER)
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER WHAT HEALTH CARE -- WHERE THE MONEY FOR THE HEALTH CARE GOES.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THE SLUTS?
I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER ANY INDIVIDUAL.
Stephen: OKAY, WELL IF OBAMACARE IS THE LAW OF THE LAND LET'S GET TO IT. OKAY, I'LL JUST DROP MY TROU HERE.
Stephen: WE DON'T DO EXAMS HERE AT THE FOOD BANK. WE JUST PROVIDE YOU WITH HEALTH CARE SO YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS TO A DOCTOR.
Stephen: LET ME GET STRAIGHT: YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU DON'T WANT TO CUT MY BALLS?
I DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT AT ALL.
Stephen: THE T.S.A. WANTS TO CUT MY BALLS. YOU'RE NOT WILLINGING TO DO THAT?
I'M NOT WILLING TO DO THAT AT ALL.
Stephen: THEY'RE PRACTICALLY BEGGING TO CUT MY BALLS.
I AM NOT CONCERNED AT ALL.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. IF I'M GOING DO THIS, I'M GOING TO DO IT RIGHT. WHAT'S THE RIGHT PLAN FOR ME?
OUR NAVIGATORS CAN WALK YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, CARLOS, LET'S SEE WHAT THEY'VE GOT. WHEN WE RETURN, THE DRAMATIC CONCLUSION OF "STEPHEN COLBERT'S I TRIED TO SIGN UP FOR OBAMACARE." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
