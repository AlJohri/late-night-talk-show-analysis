Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS IN THE NEW MOVIE TWENTY-TWO JUMP STREET.
THIS IS B.S. I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO ACTUAL COLLEGE NOT ONLINE COLLEGE. LISTENING FOR CODED MESSAGES IN LECTURES.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.
LOOK AROUND. THIS IS OUR CITY. WHAT DO WE WANT TO BE IN COLLEGE FOR.
YOU'RE RIGHT. PARTNERS FOR LIFE.
THE TIDE COMES IN AT 10:30 A.M. THEN IT WILL RETURN TO THE SEA.
LET'S REPORT.
LET'S DO THIS. TURNED DOWN FOR WHAT ♪ ♪ TURNED DOWN FOR WHAT  ♪ TURNED DOWN FOR WHAT  ♪.

Stephen: THEY LOVE YOU, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THEY'RE LOVING ME TO LOVE YOU. I'M A LOVE VEHICLE TONIGHT, THAT'S IT.
YES.
Stephen: ACTOR, WRITER, PRODUCER.

Stephen: NOMINATED TWICE FOR ACADEMY AWARDS.
YEAH.
Stephen: FIRST YOUR PERFORMANCE IN MONEY BALL THEN WOLF OF WALL STREET, NEW MOVIE TWENTY-TWO JUMP STREET, OPENS JUNE 13th.
THAT'S RIGHT, FRIDAY THE 13th. SPOOKY, NOT A HORROR MOVIE.
Stephen: BEFORE WE GET STARTED I JUST WANT TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE WAY HERE, THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: LEARNED SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING DISTURBING.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: RECENTLY. REVEALED THAT YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH ADAM LEVINE
YEAH.
Stephen: AND-- WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I HAVE HAD MOVES LIKE JAGGER IN MY HEAD FOR THREE YEARS AND SOMEONE NEEDS TO SAY THEY'RE [BLEEP] SORRY FOR THAT, ANYTHING TO SAY? NOPE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
HE IS A GREAT GUY.
Stephen: HE'S A GREAT GUY, ALL RIGHT, I WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT THAT.
BUT THE SONG IS TOO CATCHY.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU MAKE THE CROSS FROM COMEDY TO DRAMA. BECAUSE A LOT OF COMEDIANS WANT TO DO THAT OR PEOPLE WHO DO COMEDY BUT YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE RARE GUYS, LIKE YOU'VE DONE SOME GREAT COMEDY AND YOU'VE DONE OSCAR YOU KNOW, CALIBRE DRAMA. YOU ARE LIKE DUMPY TOM HANKS. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN THAT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY.
THAT IS-- THAT IS THE BEST COMPLIMENT I'VE EVER RECEIVED IN MY LIFE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'LL TAKE IT. NO, I-- I LOVE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF FILMS. I AM NOT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T FEEL FUNNY ALL THE TIME. I DON'T FEEL SUPER SERIOUS ALL THE TIME SO TO ME IT'S IMPORTANT TO GO BACK AND FORTH AND REALLY MIX IT UP, YOU KNOW, TO REALLY-- TO REALLY EXPRESS YOURSELF IN DIFFERENT WAYS, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: UH-HUH, NO, I DON'T. (LAUGHTER) CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE ANGRY AND THAT'S CHANNING TATUM.
OKAY.
Stephen: BECAUSE I SAW THE FIRST MOVIE TWENTY-ONE JUMP STREET, INCREDIBLE. I SAW THE LATEST MOVIE LAST NIGHT, BECAUSE I'M A SPECIAL PERSON, I SAW-- TWENTY-TWO JUMP STREET AND IT'S JUST AS FUNNY, YOU'RE HILARIOUS IN IT BUT HE'S HILARIOUS IN IT TOO, AND THIS IS A PICTURE OF HIM, JIMMY CAN YOU PUT THAT UP THERE. IS THAT FAIR? I THOUGHT AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I THOUGHT COMEDIANS BECAME COMEDIANS --
THAT'S AT HIS WEDDING.
Stephen: REALLY.
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. I THOUGHT COMEDIANS BECAME COMEDIANS BECAUSE IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY WERE LIVING IN THE PRIMORDIAL OOZE, LIKE SOCIAL SHRUNKEN HOMUNCULUSES WHO TELL JOKES IN ORDER TO LIFT THEIR HEAD INTO THE SOCIAL CIRCLE AND CRY OUT I AM ALIVE.
YES.
Stephen: NOTICE ME, LOVE ME.
WELL.
Stephen: WHY WOULD HE NEED THAT?
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
Stephen: DOES IT MAKE YOU ANGRY.
NO, NO, I HONESTLY.
Stephen: THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU ANGRY AT ALL?
I MEAN-- .
Stephen: LOOK AT IT! (LAUGHTER)
YEAH, I [BLEEP] HATE IT, I [BLEEP] HATE IT SO MUCH. NO, IT'S LIKE-- IT'S CRAZY WHEN YOU WORK WITH SOMEONE WHO, YOU HIRED HIM, HE WAS LIKE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE FUNNY, YOU'RE FUNNY, I'M NOT. I GO JUST BE HONEST, PLAY THE CHARACTER AND BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE ARE SAYING YOU WILL REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE WRITING IS REALLY STUPID AND THEY'LL JUST BELIEVE THESE STUPID THINGS YOU'RE SAYING AND HE DID, AND THEN I WAS LIKE [BLEEP] THIS GUY IS FUNNIER THAN ME IN THE MOVIE. I SAW THE FIRST CUT OF THE MOVIE AND I WAS LIKE OH NO. TOTALLY BACKFIRED ON ME.
Stephen: IN THE FIRST MOVIE YOU'RE COPS THAT GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL. AND THE SECOND ONE YOU ARE COPS THAT GO BACK -- CAN YOU TAKE THAT PICTURE DOWN? I CAN'T CONCENTRATE.
NO ONE IS LOOKING AT US RIGHT NOW.
I JUST LIKE HE'S IN THE CORNER OF MY EYE LIKE-- .
Stephen: IS IT TRUE YOU WORKED FOR SCORSESE LIKE $60,000 FOR WOLF OF WALL STREET BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANTED TO WORK WITH HIM.
YES, HE'S MY HERO AND ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO WAS WORK FOR MARTIN SCORSESE, GOODFELLAS IS MY FAVORITE FILM OF ALL TIME. WHEN THAT OPPORTUNITY CAME UP I WOULD HAVE PAID HIM TO JUST WORK FOR HIM. I WOULD HAVE SWEEPED THE FLOOR IF HE WANTED ME TOO.
Stephen: AM I MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU THAN SCORSESE BECAUSE I'M PAYING YOU NOTHING RIGHT NOW.
UM, IT'S A TIE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: JONAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. JONAH HILL, TWENTY-TWO JUMP STREET, NEXT FRIDAY, JUNE 13th. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
