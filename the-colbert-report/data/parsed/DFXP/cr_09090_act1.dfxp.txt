STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO THE REPORT,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR BEING IN  HERE, OUT THERE, I WANT TO  WELCOME EVERYBODY HERE. NATION, EVER SINCE PRESIDENT  OBAMA WON RE-ELECTION IN  NOVEMBER, REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN PINNING THEIR HOPES FOR 2016 ON  NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR AND GROWN-UP  CAMPBELL'S KID CHRIS CHRISTIE. SADLY, A NEW SCANDAL HAS  EXPLODED THAT COULD DERAIL  CHRISTIE'S AMBITIONS. HE WAS RECENTLY CAUGHT ON TAPE  BLATANTLY LYING TO ONE OF HIS  CONSTITUENTS ABOUT HIS PAST.
THIS IS YOUR TIME HERE. GET THE MICROPHONE.
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOW. I LIKE TO WATCH SPORTS. WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOW.
SCOOBY DOO. HOW OLD ARE YOU? FOUR. WHEN I WAS FOUR, MY FAVORITE  SHOW WAS SCOOBY DOO TOO.
Stephen: SHOCKING. SHOCKING THAT SCOOBY DOO IS  STILL ON THE AIR. ALTHOUGH IN THE NEW EPISODE WHEN  THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS GUEST  STAR, THEY'RE JOINED BY THEIR BUDDY KIM JONG-UN. WELL, IT TURNS OUT CHRISTIE WAS  FULL OF SCOOBY DOO DOO AND HE  WAS EXPOSED BY PULITZER PRIZE WINNING WATCHDOG GROUP  POLITIFACT WHO REPORTED GIVEN  THE GOVERNOR'S BIRTHDAY AND THE OFFICIAL PREMIERE DATE OF SCOOBY  DOO CHRISTIE WOULD HAVE BEEN  SEVEN YEARS OLD NOT FOUR IF HE WATCHED THE'S FIRST EPISODE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). CHRISTIE WAS WAS CLEARLY LYING  ABOUT WATCHING SCOOBY DOO WHEN  HE WAS FOUR. AND HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY  WITH IT TOO IF IT WEREN'T FOR  THOSE MEDDLING KIDS. MARK MY WORDS, SCOOBY-GATE,  TRADEMARK, WILL BRING CHRIS  CHRISTIE TO HIS KNEES FASTER THAN A SHORT FLIGHT OF STAIRS. REST ASSURED, NATION, REST  ASSURED, I WILL GET SOLVE THIS  MYSTERY JUST LIKE MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD CARTOON. INSPECTOR GADGET.
INSPECTOR GADGET CAME ON THE  AIR IN 1983. YOU WERE ALMOST 20 YEARS OLD.
Stephen: RUT-ROH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NATION, THANKS TO THE SEQUESTER,  IF YOU HAVE FLOWN IN THE LAST  COUPLE OF DAYS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT YOU DIDN'T FLY IN  THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. JIM?
STAFFING CUTS STARTED  YESTERDAY FOR AIR TRAFFIC  CONTROLLERS.
HERE COMES MAXIMUM PAIN. AIR TRAVELERS, LISTEN UP. YOUR CHANCES OF A FLIGHT DELAY  JUST WENT UP.
FEDERAL BUDGET CUTS ARE NOW  HITTING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS. THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO TAKE  EXTRA DAYS OFF.
ABOUT 400 FLIGHTS WERE  DELAYED BECAUSE OF THESE  FURLOUGHS.
PASSENGERS HAVE BEEN BOARDING  ON TIME BUT WAIT UP TO THREE  HOURS FOR THEIR FLIGHTS TO TAKE  OFF.
Stephen: OH, YES, THE  SEQUESTER CHICKENS HAVE COME  HOME TO ROOST. OR THEY WOULD HAVE HAVE IF THEY  COULD GET CLEARANCE TO TAKE OFF. BUT WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE, FOLKS. IN BAD TIMES, YOU HAVE TO SLASH  GOVERNMENT SPHENDING. AND I DON'T NEED SOME FANCY IVY  LEAGUE PAPER TO TELL ME THAT. BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY A FANCY  IVY LEAGUE PAPER TO TELL ME  THAT. THE FAMOUS 2010 STUDY "GROWTH IN  A TIME OF DEBT" BY HARVARD  ECONOMISTS KEN ROGOFF AND CAR MEN REINHART. YOU'VE GOT TO THINK HARVARD  ECONOMISTS UNDERSTAND DEBT. ALMOST AS MUCH AS HARVARD  GRADUATES. SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT FISCAL  CONSERVATIVES ALL YES ROGOFF AND  REINHART TO MAKE THE CASE FOR DRASTIC BUDGET CUTS.
I HAD ALWAYS HEARD IF IT GETS  TO 90% THAT'S A TIPPING POINT. THAT'S WHEN ECONOMIC GROWTH  STARTS TO SLOW. ROGOFF AND REINHART SHOWED THAT.
IF YOU LOOK AT ROGOFF AND  REINHART, WHAT THEY SAY, YOU  HAVE TO CONSIDER GROSS DEBT WHERE OVER 100%.
ECONOMISTS WHO HAVE STUDIED  SOVEREIGN DEBT TELL US THAT  LETTING TOTAL DEBT RISE ABOVE 90% OF G.D.P. CREATES A DRAG ON  ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INTENSIFIES  THE RISK OF A DEBT-FUELED ECONOMIC CRISIS.
Stephen: YES A DEBT-FUELED  ECONOMIC CRISIS. THAT WOULD PLUNGE US INTO  ANOTHER GREAT DEPRESSION. AND DRAG THE ENTIRE WORLD DOWN  WITH IT. NOT ONLY, NOT ONLY HAS CONGRESS  BEEN INSPIRED BY ROGAINE AND  BRAVEHEART'S MATH, THEIR WORK HAS INFLUENCED INTERNATIONAL  BUDGET SLASHERS LIKE E.U. ECONOMICS COMMISSIONER OLLI  REHN, FORMER EUROPEAN CENTRAL  BANK PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET, BUNDESBANK PRESIDENT  JENS WEIDMANN AND LORD LAMONT OF  LERWICK WHO IS NOT ONLY THE FORMER CHANCELLOR OF THE  EXCHEQUER FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM  BUT GETS KILLED BY LARRY MARY IN THE NEXT SEASON OF DOWN TON  ANDY. OF COURSE, THE LEFT WING IVORY  TOWER ACADEMIA-HOLES OUT THERE  COULDN'T STAND THAT CONSERVATIVES LIKE CROCKETT AND  TUBBS HERE WERE RIGHT SO THEY  PROVED THEM WRONG.
THE ECONOMIC THEORY  UNDERPINNING AUSTERITY POLICIES  BEING FOLLOWED BY GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE MAY BE FLAWED. THAT IS THE ALLEGATION MADE IN A  STUDY BY THE UNIVERSITY OF  MASSACHUSETTS. IT CLAIMS TO HAVE FOUND CODING  ERRORS ON THE EXCEL SPREADSHEET  USED BY THE ACADEMICS WHO HAVE PRODUCED THE THEORY WHICH COULD  INVALIDATE THEIR CONCLUSIONS.
Stephen: THE UNIVERSITY OF  MASSACHUSETTS FOUND CODING  ERRORS THAT INVALIDATE  CONCLUSIONS. NERRRRDS! I BET YOU FOUND THEM ON A FRIDAY  NIGHT WITH YOUR MOM. WHILE THE REST OF US WERE GOING  UP TO THE POINT AND DRINKING  P.B.R. I PUKED IN DAVE CON ROY'S GLOVE  COMPARTMENT. IT WAS A GOOD TIME. AND JUST LOOK AT THE POINDEXTER  WHO CAUGHT THE MISTAKES. THOMAS HERNDON WHO REVIEWED  THEIR DATA AND IMMEDIATELY  SPOTTED A BASIC SPREADSHEET ERROR AND THAT THEY HAD EXCLUDED  DATA FROM CANADA, NEW ZEALAND,  AUSTRALIA ALL COUNTRIES THAT ARE EXPERIENCED SOLID GROWTH DURING  PERIODS OF HIGH DEBT AND WOULD  THUS UNDERCUT THEIR THESIS. IF IGNORING NEW ZEALAND,  AUSTRALIA AND CANADA WERE A  CRIME, EVERYONE IN AMERICA WOULD BE ON DEATH ROW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW SURE, HERNDON'S CORRECTED  SPREADSHEETS SHOW THAT COUNTRIES  WITH DEBT OVER 90% DID NOT SEE THEIR ECONOMIES SHRINK MINUS  POINT-ONE PERCENT BUT INSTEAD  SAW THEM GROW 2.2%. BUT COME ON, 2.2% UP, .1% DOWN,  YOU SAY POTATO, I SAY ELIMINATE  FOOD STAMPS. FOR PETE'S SAKE, HOW WERE REN  AND STIMPY SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT  THEIR PAPER, THEIR PAPER WHICH HAS BROUGHT AUSTERITY TO  MILLIONS WAS FLAWED? IT WASN'T PEER REVIEWED. SO, NO ONE NEEDS TO FACT-CHECK  THEM. IT'S NOT LIKE THEY SAID THEY  WERE WATCHING SCOOBY DOO WHEN  THEY WERE FOUR. AFTER PUBLICATION IN 2010, ONE  ECONOMIST COMPLAINED THAT THEY  REFUSED TO SHARE THEIR DATA. OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T SHARE  THEIR DATA. IF THEY CAN'T USE EXCEL, I DOUBT  THEY COULD SEND IT AN EMAIL  ATTACHMENT. BUT, FOLKS, SIEGFRIED AND ROY  ARE STANDING BY THEIR RESULTS  SAYING QUOTE THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE TO DATE, INCLUDING THIS  LATEST COMMENT BY HERNDON, SEEMS  ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH OUR ORIGINAL INTERPRETATION OF THE  DATA. RIGHT. ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THEIR  INTERPRETATION BECAUSE NO MATTER  HOW MUCH THE RESULTS CHANGE, THE HYPOTHESIS MUST REMAIN THE SAME. THAT'S SCIENCE. WELL, FOLKS, NOW THAT I KNOW  ACADEMIC PAPERS DON'T HAVE TO BE  ALL MATH-Y TO MAKE A GLOBAL IMPACT, I'VE GOT SOME OF MY OWN  COMPLETELY UNSUPPORTED FINDINGS  I WOULD LIKE TO DROP. FOR INSTANCE, HYDROFRACKING  MAKES YOUR ASS LOOK BETTER IN  JEANS. CRUDE OIL: NATURE'S EGRET  MOISTURIZER. AND HOLSTER V. BRA: HOW GUN  CONTROL CAUSES MAN LOOFER BOOBS. HOW GUN CONTROL CAUSES MANBOOBS. AND UNLIKE BANGER AND MASH, MY  STUDIES ARE PIER-REVIEWED IN  THAT I SHOWED THEM TO SOME SEA GULLS ON A PIER. AND I CAN SAY,. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND I CAN SAY WITH ABSOLUTE  CERTAINTY THAT I DID NOT MAKE A  SINGLE ERROR IN MY EXCEL SPREADSHEET BECAUSE FOR THESE  STUDIES I USED "ANGRY BIRDS STAR  WARS."  BOTTOM LINE, BARTLES & JAMES' STUDY IS STILL VALID NO MATTER  WHAT SOME PUNK U-MASS AMHERST  E-CON GRAD STUDENT NAMED THOMAS HERNDON SAYS. AND WHEN WE RETURN, I WILL BE  JOINED BY PUNK-ASS AMHERST E-CON  GRAD STUDENT
