( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, LISTEN UP, EVERYBODY, I  WANT YOU TO NEVER FORGET--  PLEASE, PLEASE. YOU GOTTA HEAR THIS. FOLKS. NEVER FORGET THAT FEAR IS JUST A  STATE OF MIND. A CRIPPLING STATE OF MIND THAT  COULD KILL YOU. THIS IS THE THREAT-DOWN. ( SIREN )  FOLKS, FOR YEARS I'VE WARNED YOU  THAT BEARS ARE GODLESS KILLING  MACHINES. NOW, THERE IS PROOF THAT THEY'VE  NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THOU SHALT  NOT STEAL.
CALL THE ON VIDEO, A BEAR  STEALING A MAN'S iPAD IN THE  WOODS. CAMERAS WERE ROLE WHEN THE BEAR  CASUALLY NABBED THE BACKPACK BUT  AN iPAD WAS INSIDE THE  BACKPACK.
Stephen:  THANKS RAY LOT,  BEAR. YOU RUINED A PERFECTLY GOOD  AFTERNOON OF WATCHING PORN AT  THE LAKE. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER  THREE, APPLE FAN-BEARS. INFORMATION THE ONLY THING WORSE  THAN BEING MAULED BY A GRIZZ, IS  BEING MAULED BY A GRIZZ HALFWAY  THROUGH FRUIT NINJA. PUT THAT THING DOWN FOR FIVE  MINUTE'S, FOR GOD'S SAKE, EAT  ME. WHILE YOU HAVER FACE TIMING YOU  COULD BE EATING MY FACE. AFTER THEY FINISH EATING US  THEY'LL POST ?ARKING REVIEW ON  YELP. GAMEY TINY PORTIONS, ATMOSPHERE  SCREAMY. WOULD NOT EAT THEM. AGAIN.   ( APPLAUSE )     ( CHEERS )   OH, AND GOOD LUCK HOLDING A SPOT  IN LINE FOR THE NEXT iPHONE  LAUNCH. ( LAUGHTER )  NEXT UP, FOR YEARS, I HAVE BEEN  SAYING WE CONOT NEED ALTERNATIVE  ENERGY ANY MORE THAN WE NEED ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLES. IT'S ADAM AND EVE, NOT ADAM AND  WIND TURBINES. ( LAUGHTER )  WELL NOW, THE ECHO-NUTS HAVE  GONE TOO FAR.
ALCOHOL COULD BE THE KEY TO  LOWERING GAS PRICES. A DISTILLERY IN SCOTT LANT IS  CREATING BIOFEEL OUT OF WHISKEY  LEFTOVERS. THE BIOFUEL WITH A KICK WOULD BE  USED IN ANY UNMODIFIED CAR OR  TRUCK ON THE ROAD.
Stephen:  WHICH BRINGS ME  TO THREAT NUMBER TWO-- DRUNK  CARS. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT EYE  CAN'T TEXT WHILE DRIVING BUT MY  AUDI CAN GET HAMMERED. THIS MEANS WHEN I GO OUT, MY CAR  WILL NEED ITS OWN DESIGNATED  CAR. ( LAUGHTER ). FINALLY, THE NUMBER ONE THREAT  TO AMERICA, BEARS.

IT WAS RIGHT BEFORE 9:00 P.M. WHEN A 120-POUND FEMALE BLACK  BEAR CUB WAS SPOTTED INSIDE THE  SEARs AT PITTSBURGH MILLS  MALL.

Stephen:  THAT IS  UNBELIEVABLE. ( LAUGHTER )  PEOPLE STILL SHOP AT SEARS. AND, FOLKS, A SECOND INCIDENT  PROVES THAT BEARS ARE CASING THE  PITTSBURGH MILLS MALL.
911 DISPATCHERS TELL US THAT  A LARGER BEAR WAS LATER SPOTTED  JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT BY THE  OLIVE GARDEN RESTAURANT AT THE PITTSBURGH MILLS MALL.
Stephen:  OH, THE BEARS ARE  CLEARLY ON TO US. THEY KNOW WE CAN'T SHOOT THEM AT  THE OLIVE GARDEN BECAUSE WHEN  YOU'RE THERE, YOU'RE FAMILY. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  AND AT OUR MALLS, WE ARE AT OUR  MOST VULNERABLE. WE'VE ALL SEEN BEARS WAITING AT  THE TOP OF A WATER FALL PICK OFF  UNSUSPECTING SALMON. ( LAUGHTER ).

( LAUGHTER )  I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT THE MEAT  IS. OUR ONLY HOPE OF GETTING THESE  BEARS OUT OF OUR MALLS IS TO  FIRST TRANQUILIZE THEM WITH  HEAVY SEDATIVES SO, SOMEONE, PLEASE LEAD THEM TO A
