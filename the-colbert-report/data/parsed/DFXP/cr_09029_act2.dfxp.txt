(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. NATION, I HAVE BEEN SAYING FAR  MONTH NOW THAT ONCE THE  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS OVER I HOPE WE'LL FINALLY SEE  BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE IN  WASHINGTON. AND I SINER IS VIE MEAN THAT I  SAID IT. (LAUGHTER)  SADLY, THE POWER-MAD DEMOCRATS  DECIDED THAT JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE  VOTED FOR THEM, THEY'RE IN  POWER. AND THEY'RE ALREADY TRAMPLING  OUR FREEDOMS.
Reporter: DEMOCRATS ARE  PROVING YET AGAIN THEY WILL DO  ANYTHING TO PUSH THROUGH THEIR LIBERAL AGENDA. NOW THEY HAVE GONE A STEP TOO  FAR. SENATE DEMOCRATS WITH HARRY REID  LEADING THE CHARGE WANT TO  DRASTICALLY CHANGE THE FILIBUSTER IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE  REPUBLICANS' ABILITY TO OPPOSE  CERTAIN LEGISLATION.
Stephen: YES, HARRY REID IS  TRYING TO STOP REPUBLICANS FROM  BLOCKING CERTAIN LEGISLATION. FOR INSTANCE, ANY LEGISLATION. HE'S CHIPPING AWAY AT THE SACRED  SENATORIAL INSTITUTION KNOWN AS  THE FILIBUSTER WHICH ALLOWS THE MINORITY PARTY TO PREVENT A BILL  FROM COMING TO A VOTE SIMPLY BY  SPEAKING NON-STOP ON THE SENATE  FLOOR. FOR INSTANCE, BY READING THE  PHONE BOOK. THAT'S HOW, IN 1974, THE D.C. METRO AREA YELLOW PAGES WERE  SIGNED INTO LAW. (LAUGHTER)  THE COURTS HAVE SINCE REPEATEDLY  UPHELD THAT CLAY'S AUDIO HAS THE MOST FAR OUT SELECTION OF  8-TRACKS IN TOWN. BUT IN 1975, THIS RULE WAS  CHANGED SO THAT A SENATOR DIDN'T  HAVE TO ACTUALLY SPEAK, MERELY STATE HIS INTENTION OF LAUNCHING  A FILIBUSTER. A TECHNIQUE MADE FAMOUS IN THE  CLASSIC MOVIE "MR. SMITH GOES TO  WASHINGTON AND EXPRESSES HIS INTENTION TO LATE DORE  SOMETHING."  (LAUGHTER)  NOW, HARRY REID'S DOING THIS  BECAUSE HE CLAIMS REPUBLICANS ARE ABUSING THE FILIBUSTER.
I HAVE FACED 386 FILIBUSTERS.
Stephen: 386 FILIBUSTERS  DURING HARRY REID'S SIX YEARS AS  MAJORITY LEADER. AND GIVEN HOW LITTLE CONGRESS  WORKS, SOME OF THAT HAS TO BE  MITCH McCONNELL STOPPING BY HARRY REID'S FAMILY DINNER TO  BLOCK PASSAGE OF THE MASHED  POTATO. (LAUGHTER)  BUT I SAY SO WHAT? THAT'S JUST POLITICS. AND MITCH McCONNELL IS WARNING  IT COULD GET WORSE.
IF THE MAJORITY CHOOSES TO  END THE FILIBUSTER, IF THEY  CHOOSE TO CHANGE THE RULES AND PUT AN END TO DEMOCRATIC DEBATE  THEN THE FIGHTING, THE  BITTERNESS, AND THE GRIDLOCK WILL ONLY GET WORSE. IN THE NAME OF EFFICIENCY THEY  WOULD PREVENT THE VERY  POSSIBILITY OF COMPROMISE AND THREATEN TO MAKE THE DISPUTES OF  THE PAST FEW YEARS LOOK LIKE  MERE PILLOW FIGHTS.
Stephen: HE'S RIGHT. TO ME THEY ALREADY LOOK LIKE  PILLOW FIGHTS. I'M PRETTY SURE JOE LIEBERMAN'S  JOWLS ARE MEMORY FOAM. (LAUGHTER)  SO YOU'VE BEEN WARNED, HARRY  REID! TAKE AWAY MITCH McCONNELL'S  FILIBUSTER AND HE WILL STRIKE  BACK BY OBSTRUCTING EVERYTHING YOU DO! OR LET HIM KEEP THE FILIBUSTER  SO HE CAN OBSTRUCT EVERYTHING  YOU DO! (LAUGHTER)  I THINK THE CHOICE IS CLEAR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
