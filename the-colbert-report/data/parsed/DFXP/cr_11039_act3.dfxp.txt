WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT, PHIL KLAY WON THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR HIS SHORT STORIES ABOUT SERVING IN IRAQ. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SHORT. THEY ENDED UP GOING ON FOR TEN YEARS. PLEASE WELCOME PHIL KLAY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, PHIL. THANKS FOR COMING ON.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
YOU ARE A MARINE VETERAN WHO SERVED IN ANBAR PROVINCE IN IRAQ FROM JANUARY 2007 TO FEBRUARY 2008. AND YOU HAVE WRITTEN A COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE CALLED "REDEPLOYMENT" AND IT RECENTLY WON THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR FICTION AND WAS NAMED BY "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AS ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THE BOOK HAS GOT 12 STORIES ABOUT THE IRAQ WAR. BUT DO WE REALLY NEED 12 STORIES TO TELL THE IRAQ WAR? ISN'T IT, YOU KNOW, CHAPTER ONE, AMERICA KICKS ASS. CHAPTER TWO, AMERICA TAKES NAMES. CHAPTER THREE, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO TELL WITH YOUR STORIES?
WELL, I THINK YOU NEED A LOT MORE THAN JUST 12 STORIES. THIS IS MY OFFERING TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT IRAQ. I THINK WE DESPERATELY NEED TO BE HAVING. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A LOT MORE STORIES ABOUT IRAQ TO COME.
DON'T GET ME WRONG, I AM NO GREATER SUPPORTER OF THE TROOPS THAN YOURS TRULY. BUT THE IRAQ WAR IS OVER. AND IT WAS VERY DIVISIVE, OKAY. TOWARD THE END THERE, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS BAD. I DIDN'T GO SO I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. I WANTED TO BUT I WAS BUSY HERE USING THE TROOPS AS A CUDGEL AGAINST PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH ME. YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU. DO WE NEED TO STILL THINK ABOUT THE WAR? I MEAN THE WAR IS OVER. WHY CAN'T WE MOVE ON, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW WAR IN IRAQ, SOON. DON'T WE NEED TO --
IT'S NOT REALLY OVER, THAT IS ONE THING.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT OVER?
IT'S NOT OVER FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE, CERTAINLY. WE'RE STILL INVOLVED IN IRAQ. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE GO TO WAR, THE OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE, AS A COUNTRY, THEY'RE LONG-LASTING. THEY'RE LONG-LASTING IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE OWE THE VETERANS WHO COME HOME. SOME OF THEM, YOU KNOW, WHO NEED LONG TERM MEDICAL CARE. AND YOU KNOW, WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THINK VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT HOW WE USE MILITARY FORCE WHETHER WE HAVE DONE SO WISELY AND WHAT LESSONS WE CAN DRAW FOR THE FUTURE TO MAKE US A MORE RESPONSIBLE NATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ARE THERE PEOPLE THAT YOU SERVED WITH WHO CAN LOOK AT THESE STORIES AND SAY I KNOW WHAT INFLUENCED YOU? I KNOW THAT SITUATION? I WAS THERE IN THAT STORY.
WELL, I DID INTERVIEW A LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, I WENT TO IRAQ AND DREW ON MY OWN EXPERIENCES. THERE'S NO ONE PERSON WHO IS JUST A SORT OF THINLY FICTIONALIZED INDIVIDUAL. BECAUSE I WOULD FEEL CONSTRAINED, SOMEHOW. I DON'T THINK I COULD BE AS, IN A WEIRD WAY AS TRUTHFUL AS I WANTED TO BE IN TRYING TO CHASE DOWN THE EXPERIENCES I WAS TRYING TO ARTICULATE ON THE PAGE.
Stephen: YOU COULD BE MORE TRUTHFUL BY MAKING THINGS UP.
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: REALLY?
ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE ILIAD. IF THERE WAS A TROJAN WAR VETERAN HERE AND YOU GAVE HIM THE ILIAD HE WOULD PROBABLY COMPLAIN ABOUT ALL THE INACCURACIES.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT WHAT ACHILLES ARMOUR LOOKED LIKE?
RIGHT.
Stephen: RHESUS WASN'T WORTH IT.
AND YET EVERY GENERATION SINCE HAS READ THAT BOOK AND SAID, YOU KNOW, HE'S DESCRIBING WAR. HE UNDERSTANDS THE EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: WELL, AS SOMEBODY WHO, YOU KNOW, WANTS TO SUPPORT THE TROOPS AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY WANTS TO SEEM LIKE SOMEONE WHO SUPPORTS THE TROOPS, WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THOSE WHO SERVED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. AND ANY OF OUR WARS. WHAT DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND?
I MEAN, FIRST OFF, THERE IS NO ONE EXPERIENCE. IT'S PART OF WHY I WROTE 12 STORIES, THEY ARE ALL FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, DIFFERENT NARRATORS DOING DIFFERENT JOBS, THERE IS AN INFANTRYMAN A CHAPLAIN,  A MORTUARY AFFAIRS SPECIALIST FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER, AND THE OTHER THING I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST WHAT YOU EXPERIENCE OVERSEAS, IT'S ALSO WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO COME HOME. WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO COME HOME AS PART OF, YOU KNOW, VERY SMALL FRACTION OF AMERICA THAT SERVED.
Stephen: LESS THAN ONE PERCENT
RIGHT. TO THE COUNTRY THAT SENT YOU OVER. AND YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY, THESE WARS ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY. IF, YOU KNOW, IF YOU VOTED FOR BUSH OR YOU VOTED FOR OBAMA, IF YOU'RE A TAXPAYER IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE WARS AT ALL, PROBABLY ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE WARS AT ALL, THESE ARE YOUR WARS. AND WE ALL AS CITIZENS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THINK ABOUT THEM AND JOIN IN THAT CONVERSATION.
Stephen: YOU WENT OVER-- YOU WENT OVER IN 2007.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHEN IRAQ WAS THE WORST PLACE ON THE PLANET. THE SURGE HADN'T STARTED YET.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND REALLY, THERE WASN'T A SENSE THAT IT COULD EVER BE TURNED AROUND. SO YOU LEFT FROM AN AMERICA THAT FELT THAT THIS THING WAS UNSAVEABLE. AND YOU CAME BACK A YEAR LATER, HAD THE SURGE STARTED AT THAT POINT?
SO I WAS THERE FROM-- THROUGH THE SURGE AND THROUGH A LOT OF THE ANBAR AWAKENING, ANBAR HAD BEEN THE LOST PROVINCE IN 2006. AND THEN VIOLENCE RADICALLY DECREASED DURING THAT TIME. SO A LOT OF US LEFT IRAQ FEELING VERY POSITIVELY ABOUT WHAT WE THOUGHT HAD HAPPENED THERE. AND OF COURSE NOW A LOT OF VETS ARE LOOKING AT IRAQ AND WHAT IS HAPPENING. AND TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT. I TOOK THE SHOW OVER THERE FOR JUST ONE WEEK IN 2009. HEY, IT'S HOT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE HARD TO CONVEY IN PRINT. WE LANDED AT 10:30 AT NIGHT AND IT WAS 125 DEGREES. HOW MUCH TALCUM POWDER DID YOU GO THROUGH? BECAUSE AS FAR AS CAN TELL THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS COATED WITH ORANGE TALCUM POWDER.
IT'S A VERY SWEATY PLACE. UH-HUH. ALSO,.
Stephen: BACON LIKE PORK PRODUCTS YOU CAN'T ORDER IT OVER THERE IN A RESTAURANT, IN THE MIDDLE EAST, EVEN-- WE WERE ON OUR WAY THROUGH KUWAIT TO GO THIS THERE, COULDN'T GET LIKE A BLT. WHEN I GOT TO CAMP VICTORY, THERE WAS SO MUCH [BLEEP] BACON--  (APPLAUSE) IT WAS LIKE-- IT WAS LIKE A POLITICAL STATEMENT. LIKE 24 HOURS A DAY I COULD GO TO MESS AND GET BACON DID YOU HAVE THE BACON EXPERIENCE?
I DIDN'T EAT A LOT OF BACON OVER THERE THERE WERE A LOT OF POP STARTS-- TARTS BUT MAYBE WE WERE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF IRAQ.
Stephen: A BACON POPTART, CAN YOU IMAGINE? WELL PHIL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: PHIL KLAY, THE BOOK IS REDEPLOYMENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
