Stephen: GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS, WELCOME, WELCOME ONE AND ALL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. AS YOU CAN TELL BY THE ENERGY IN THIS ROOM WE ARE IN NIGHT THREE OF MY SUPERB OWL COVERAGE AND I AM PUMPED FOR SUNDAY'S BIG GAME WHICH TO ME IS FOOTBALL CHRISTMAS. EVERY YEAR I PUT OUT A PLATE OF BUFFALO WINGS AND RANCH DRESSING IN THE HOPES THAT TERRY BRADSHAW WILL COME DOWN MY CHIMNEY. IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET. BUT I STILL  BELIEVE, TERRY! (LAUGHTER) WITH THE BIG GAME JUST A FEW DAYS AWAY AMERICA IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO DECIDE WHICH TEAM THEY PRETENDED TO HAVE LIKED ALL ALONG. AND FOLKS WE'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN HERE AT THE REPORT. IT HAS BEEN A GREAT WEEK OF FOOTBALL GUESTS, ANALYSIS AND NONLEGALLY ACTIONABLE  SYNONYMS FOR SUNDAY'S BIG GAME. I HAVE REALLY GROWN TO LOVE THE OLD SPLIT COW HIDE AS NO ONE CALLS IT (LAUGHTER)
BUT I THINK PERHAPS I'M MOST EMOTIONAL ABOUT THE JOURNEY I HAVE TAKEN TOWARD BECOMING A FORMER CHAMPIONSHIP CALIBRE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE, TONIGHT JOIN ME NOW IN THE DRAMATIC CONCLUSION OF STEPHEN COLBERT'S FALLBACK POSITION. STEPHEN COLBERT'S FALLBACK POSITION. LAST NIGHT I ASKED LEGENDARY COACH JOE GIBBS FOR HIS HELP IN MY QUEST FOR A SUPER BOWL RING. AND MASTERED THE ART OF QUARTERBACKING WITH THE DREAM MAKER STEVE CLARKSON.
OKAY, I KNOW WHERE I AM. AFTER ALMOST 45 MINUTES OF GRUELING PREPARATION IT WAS TIME TO SHOW THE OLD MAN WHAT I WAS MADE OF.
WELL, COACH, I'M ABOUT TO PLAY MY FIRST SCRIMMAGE, OBVIOUSLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BEFORE ANY GAME IS THE INSPIRATIONAL SPEECH BY THE COACH. I HAVE WRITTEN A FEW WORDS HERE. I WOULDN'T MIND HEARING FROM A MAN LIKE YOU.
STEPHEN, I HAVE COACHED MANY A MAN BUT NONE LIKE YOU. YOU COMBINE CHARISMA, LOOKS AND ATHLETICISM INTO ONE DAZZLING PACKAGE. SO GO OUT THERE AND WIN ONE FOR THE GIPPER. BY WHICH I MEAN RONALD REAGAN. SHOW ME THE MONEY? ARE YOU THERE GOD? IT'S ME MARGARET. EYE OF THE TIGER.
Stephen: OH, I SHOULD GO. I WOULD BE JOINED BY FORMER NFL RECEIVER ISAAC BRUCE, FOUR TIME PRO BOWLER, SUPER BOWL CHAMP AND THE THELMA TO MY LOUISE. MY OPPONENT, GERALD McCOY, TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS DEFENSIVE TACKLE, ONE OF THE MOST FEARED DEFENDERS IN THE NFL TWO TIME PRO BOWLER AND 300 POUNDS OF ANGRY MAN MEAT.
