[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, I'M NOT PROUD OF IT, BUT  SOME NIGHTS, I GO TOO EASY ON  OUR RADICAL MARXIST HOMO-FASCIST SECRET KENYAN TRAVESTY OF A JOKE  OF A SO-CALLED PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT CAN I SAY? MAYBE I'M MELLOWING WITH AGE. AND SADLY, TONIGHT IS ONE OF  THOSE NIGHTS, BECAUSE BARACK  OBAMA HAS FINALLY DONE SOMETHING RIGHT IN THE WAR ON TERROR. AFTER YEARS OF EMPTY PROMISES,  HE IS CLOSING GUANTANAMO'S  OFFICE OF CLOSING GUANTANAMO. [ LAUGHTER ] WE DID IT! FINALLY, AMERICA CAN MOVE BEYOND  THE SAD CHAPTER OF TRYING TO  CLOSE DOWN OUR GULAG BY THE SEA. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY'RE CLOSING THE OFFICE  OF CLOSING GITMO NOT A MOMENT  TOO SOON. I HEARD THE CONDITIONS IN THAT  OFFICE WERE HORRIFIC. PEOPLE HELD FOR YEARS IN  CRAMPED, POORLY-LIT QUARTERS AND  REPEATEDLY WATER-COOLERED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND MORE GRATIFYING TO  CONSERVATIVES LIKE ME, KEEPING  GITMO OPEN WILL SECURE THIS KEY PART OF GEORGE BUSH'S LEGACY. ALONG WITH BRUSH-FREE PATHS IN  CRAWFORD AND THE INVENTION OF  THE SAFETY PRETZEL. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  DIDN'T ABANDON DUE PROCESS ALL  BY THEMSELVES. NO, NONE OF THIS GIVING UP WOULD  HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE  HEROIC ROADBLOCKS THROWN UP BY CONGRESS, WHICH PASSED LAWS  BARRING THE TRANSFER OF  DETAINEES INTO THE UNITED  STATES, THAT PROHIBITED TRANSFERRING DETAINEES TO  COUNTRIES WITH TROUBLED SECURITY  CONDITIONS. AND RESTRICTED DETAINEES FROM  BEING RETURNED HOME EVEN IF THEY  HAD BEEN PROMISED IT AS PART OF A PLEA DEAL. THEREBY UPHOLDING THE  CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED  RIGHT OF "HABEUS PSYCH!" [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, THE SPECIAL ENVOY IN CHARGE  OF CLOSING THE PRISON DANIEL  FRIED, SEEN HERE JUDGING MANKIND AND FINDING US WANTING, HAS BEEN [ LAUGHTER ] REASSIGNED TO WORK ON ISSUES  LIKE IRAN AND SYRIA. THAT'S JUST MORE OBAMA CRONYISM. THE GUY FAILS AT ONE JOB, SO  THEY GIVE HIM A CUSHY POST  SOLVING THE MIDDLE EAST. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, I APPLAUD THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION'S MATURE  DECISION. CLEARLY THESE DETAINEES ARE  GOING TO BE THERE UNTIL THEY  DIE. SO IT'S TIME WE EMBRACE GITMO AS  A PART OF THIS COUNTRY. AND NOT AS A PLACE FOR  PERMANENTLY IMPRISONING PEOPLE  WITHOUT CHARGES IN A KAFKA-ESQUE LABYRINTH OF HUMAN DESPAIR BUT  MORE AS A TERRORIST RETIREMENT  COMMUNITY JIHADI MEADOWS. [ LAUGHTER ] AFTER ALL, LIKE OUR SENIORS,  THEY WEAR BRIGHTLY-COLORED  JUMPSUITS, THEY'RE OFTEN ON A LIQUID DIET, AND WE TRY OUR BEST  NOT TO THINK ABOUT THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WHO KNOWS, GUANTANAMO BAY  MAY EVEN BECOME POPULAR WITH OUR  OWN SENIORS. AFTER ALL, IT'S JUST LIKE  FLORIDA BUT WITH FEWER CUBANS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
