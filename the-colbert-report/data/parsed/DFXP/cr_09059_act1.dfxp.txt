Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO SEE YOU. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING SEE IT BEN] [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] THANK  YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, NATION, EVERYBODY IN THIS  COUNTRY KNOWS AMERICA IS AT  CYBER WAR. IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THEN YOU  OBVIOUSLY HAVE NEVER SEEN THE  MOVIE JOHNNY KNEW MONIC OR GIVEN YOUR AM EX-NUMBER TOLL  VOLUME/35. WHERE THE HELL ARE THE MAX GIRTH  HERBAL SETTLEMENTS. YOU PROMISED MUST SATISFY IN THE  SEX TIME THEY WANTS SO BAD IN  ALL HAPPY SPOTS LAX LAUGH THE HACKERS HAVE STRUCK AGAIN.
A HACKER BROKE INTO THE  PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNTS OF  MEMBERS OF BUSH FAMILY.
THE HACKER KNOWN ABOUT IT  NAME GOOSEIFER GAINED ACCESS TO  NAMES, ADDRESSES AND PHOTOS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. GOOSIFER. POLICE HAVE ALREADY RELEASE AID  SKETCH OF CRIMINAL. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S THE GUY. PRESIDENT BUSH IS NOW SAY  PRIVATE CITIZEN, PLEASE. SOME HACKER HAS NO RIGHT TO  SPREAD HIS PERSONAL INFORMATION  ALL OVER THE INTERNET. THAT'S FACEBOOK'S JOB. I CONDEMN GOOSIFER AND I FURTHER  CONDEMN ALL JOURNALISTS  EXPLOITING THIS VIOLATION TOLL FILL AIR TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JIMMY? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DO WE HAVE ANYTHING ON THIS? [LAUGHTER] THE MOST INTERESTING ITEMS TAKEN  FROM THE ACCOUNT, A PAIR OF  PAINTINGS FROM GEORGE W. BUSH.
Stephen: YES, PAINGTS BY  GEORGE W. BUSH. PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS HIS GLOBAL  INITIATIVE AND JIMMY CARTER HAS  HABITAT FOR HUMANITY BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT GEORGE W. BUSH IS HARD  AT WORK PAINTING SELF PORTRAITS  IN THE SHOWER. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT SAY BOLD ARTISTIC VISION  THAT SAYS FACES ARE HARD. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT LIKE THE PRESIDENT SITS  AROUND DAY PAINTING SHOWER  PORTRAITS. HE ALSO DID ONE TAKING A BATH  BECAUSE AFTER A HARD DAY'S  PAINTING IN THE SHOWER, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A RELAXING PAINT IN  THE TUB. OF COURSE, WE MAY NEVER KNOW  EXACTLY WHAT THE ARTIST INTENDED  WITH THESE WORKS BUT LOOKING AT THE MUTED PALETTE, THE FUSION OF  THE DELICATE BACKGROUND, I THINK  IT'S SAFE TO SAY, HOW CAN I KILL SOME TIME BEFORE SWAMP WARS. [LAUGHTER] NATION, THIS MORNING I DID WHAT  I ALWAYS DO, I WENT ON  HUFFINGTON POST TO GET MY RAGE LEVELS UP AND TO CHECK OUT THE  MOST ADORABLE PANDA NIP SLIPS  BUT WHEN I WAS THERE I SAW SOMETHING TRULY SHOCKING. ACTUAL NEWS. ACCORDING TO THE 72-POINT FONT:   POPE OUT. NATURALLY I WAS SHOCKED. THE POPE CAME OUT OF THE CLOSET? [LAUGHTER] I MEAN IT MAKES -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN IT MAKES SENSE. THE GUY HASN'T HAD A GIRLFRIEND  IN LIKE FOREVER AND HE'S A TOTAL  CATCH BUT IT TURNED TOUT BE SOMETHING MUCH MORE SHOCK.
THE BREAKING NEWS THIS  MORNING, POPE BENEDICT SAYING HE  WILL RESIGN.
HE WILL RESIGN AT THE END OF  FEBRUARY.
Stephen: RESIGN? THE POPE IS QUITTING? POPES DON'T QUIT. GOD HAS A WAY OF TELLING POPES  WHEN IT'S TIME TO RETIRE. IT'S CALLED DEATH, OKAY? [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] VERY FEW AUDIENCES ARE WILLING  TO APPLAUD FOR DEATH. [ LAUGHTER ] THINK ABOUT IT, YOU DIDN'T SEE  JP2 TRADING HIS PAPAL STAFF FOR  A NINE IRON AND MOVING TO BOCA. A POPE HAS NOT VOLUNTARILY  RESIGNED IN 717 YEARS. I MEAN WHAT IS EVEN THE RITUAL  FOR ANNOUNCING IT? I KNOW WHEN THE CARDINALS ARE  VOTING, NO POPE IS BLACK SMOKE. A NEW POPE IS WHITE SMOKE. I ASSUME SLACKER SPOAP BONG  SMOKE. -- SLACKER POPE IS BONG SMOKE. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHY IS THE HOLY SEE SAYING HOLY  SEE YOU LATER?
IT'S STRENGTH OF MIND AND  BODY IS NECESSARY. STRENGTH HAS TEE DETERIORATING  IN ME TO THE EXTEND THAT I COULD  ACCURATELY FULFILL THE MINISTRY ENTRUSTED TO ME.
Stephen: REALLY? I'M CALLING P.M. IT ON THIS ONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FIRST OF ALL, YOU DENT GET TO  LEAVE FOR THAT? YOU THINK I'M MENTALLY AND  PHYSICALLY UP TO DOING MY JOB? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I'M DUCT TAPED TO THIS CHAIR  EVERY NIGHT AND THE ONLY REASON  MY LIPS ARE STILL MOVING IS BECAUSE THEY RUB THE TOP OF MY  MOUTH WITH PEANUT BUTTER. [ LAUGHTER ] POPE BENEDICT IS CLEARLY BEING  PUSHED OUT. I KNOW THIS MAY SHOCK YOU BUT  IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE CATHOLIC  CHURCH IS INVOLVED IF A COVERUP. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST -- I JUST CANNOT GET OVER  THIS. WHAT IS BENEDICT GOING TO DO  WITH HIMSELF IN RETIREMENT? BECOME A WAL-MART GREETER, OR I  DON'T KNOW TAKE UP A NEW HOBBY? I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SEEING HIS  SELF PORTRAIT IN THE SHOWER. [ LAUGHTER ] THINK ABOUT THIS, OKAY. HIS DEPARTURE IS GOING TO LEAVE  A TERRIBLE VOID. HE IS OUT ON FEBRUARY 28 BUT THE  COLLEGE OF CARDINALS MAY NOT  ELECT A NEW POPE UNTIL THE END OF MARCH. DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS? WE COULD HAVE AN ENTIRE MONTH  WITH NO INFALLIBLE PERSON ON  EARTH. THERE'S NO RULES. IT'S LIKE A CATHOLIC FREE FOR  ALL, PASSION OUT PEZ DISSPENCERS  FULL OF BIRTH CONTROL, USING THE LORD'S NAME IN VEIN, IT'S LIKE  BEING A PRESBYTERIAN. [ LAUGHTER ] WHO IS ON DECK? WHO IS THE NEXT POPE?
WHO IS THE NEXT POPE?
WHO COMES NEXT, WE DON'T  KNOW.
I LOVE DOING THIS, BY THE  WAY, IT'S MORE FUN THAN ANYTHING  I'VE DONE LATELY. IT'S A HORSE RACE.
Stephen: YES, IT'S A HORSE  RACE, THANK YOU, CHRIS. THE ROCK ON WHOM JESUS BUILT HIS  CHURCH, YEAH, BASICALLY THE SAME  AS THE IOWA STRAW POLLS. [ LAUGHTER ] I COULD GO FOR SOME MASHED  POTATOES. [LAUGHTER] WHO IS IT GOING TO BE? WHO IS GOING TOW ABOUT THE NEXT  POPE? FOR MORE LET'S HEAD OPEN TO THE  PAPAL SPECULATRON 7500. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE PAPAL SPECULATRO  WHERE WE TAKE YOU DOWN TO  PARADISE CITY, WHERE THE SMOKE IS WHITE AND GIRLS ARE NOT  PERMITTED. LET'S LOOK WHERE YOU FIND  CATHOLICS IN THE WORLD. THIS AREA. [LAUGHTER] NOW, THE EARLY FAVORITE IS THE  ARCHBISHOP OF MILAN ANGELO SCOLA  UNTIL JOHN PAUL II ITALIANS HELD THE PAPACY FOR 50 0 YEARS. IT WAS THE ULTIMATE DYNASTY LIKE  THE YANKEES ONLY WITH LESS  MONEY. CARDINAL MARK OUELETTE IS A  MAJOR FRONT RUNNER WITH ONE  PROBLEM:  HE'S A CANADIAN.  P.M. SAYING, I DON'T THINK GOD  WANTS YOU TO USE A CONDOM, AYE,  WON'T WORK. WHO WANTS A POPE WITH A STAFF  LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] SOME ARE BRGT ON A THIRD WORLD  POPE LIKE GHANA'S PETER TURKSON  WHO WOULD BE THE FIRST BLOCK POPE OF 1500 YEARS SENDING A  MESSAGE OF INCLUSION AND  VIRTUALLY GUARANTEEING TYLER PERRY'S MADEA GOES TO ROME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HELLO. HELLO. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, I SAY IT'S HIGH TIME WE  HAD AN AMERICAN POPE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AFTER ALL -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AFTER ALL, GOD IS AN AMERICAN. THAT'S WHY THE INTIEBL IN  ENGLISH. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THERE'S A GREAT CANDIDATE.
TIMOTHY DOLAN IS THE MOST  POWERFUL CATHOLIC IN THE  COUNTRY, THE PRESIDENT OF PRESIDENT CATHOLIC BISONS.
Stephen: EVEN MORE  IMPORTANT DOLE JANUARY MY  PERSONAL BFF:  BISHOP FRIEND  FOREVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TONIGHT, TONIGHT, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN I'M GIVING TIMOTHY  CARDINAL DOLAN THE COLBERT BUMP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL YOU CATHOLICS OUT THERE, I  WANT TO YOU VOTE FOR HIM. WHAT IS THAT? WE DON'T GET TO VOTE? THAT IS TARASPACIEZ. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN WE RETURN I'LL HANDICAP  THIS RACE WITH THE CHAPLAIN OF
