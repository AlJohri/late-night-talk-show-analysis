Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, FOLKS, IF YOU WERE WATCHING THE SHOW LAST WEEK I TOLD YOU ABOUT HOW I'D BEEN NOMINATED FOR A GRAMMY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL NOW, FOLKS, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU AGAIN, I'VE BEEN NOMINATED FOR A GRAMMY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S FOR THE AUDIO VERSION OF MY BOOK "AMERICA AGAIN: REBECOMEING THE GREATNESS WE NEVER WEREN'T." (LAUGHTER) IT'S UP FOR BEST SPOKEN WORD ALBUM AND THERE'S ONLY ONE THING STANDING BETWEEN ME AND MY GRAMMY-- AND IT'S FOUR THINGS. DAVID SEDARIS, CAROL BURNETT, BILLY CRYSTAL AND THE 94-YEAR-OLD FOLK LEGEND PETE SEEGER. I HAVE VOWED TO CRUSH THEM LIKE AMAZINGLY TALENTED BUGS AND WHEN I GO ON STAGE TO ACCEPT MY AWARD ON GRAMMY NIGHT -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SPOKEN WORD NOMINEE BILLY (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SPOKEN WORD NOMINEE BILLY CRYSTAL! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
HELLO, STEPHEN. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: HEY, BILL, WHAT'S UP?
WHAT AM I DOING HERE? I'M CURRENTLY PERFORMING MY ONE-MAN SHOW "700 SUNDAYS" AT THE IMPERIAL THEATER, 249 WEST 45th STREET ONLY THREE MORE WEEKS. BUT THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.
Stephen: THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?
I THINK I JUST HEARD YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING TO CRUSH ME.
Stephen: THE WORD "CRUSH" GETS THROWN AROUND SO MUCH IN THIS BUSINESS DO WE EVEN KNOW WHAT IT MEANS ANYMORE?
HOW ABOUT TO DESTROY, HUMILIATE?
Stephen: THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT, YEAH.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU SON OF A BITCH. I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW I WAS A BIG STAR IN THIS TOWN BEFORE YOU WERE JUST SLIGHTLY YOUNGER THAN I AM. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I STILL AM, BILLY.
YOU SON OF A BITCH. I DESERVE THAT GRAMMY. ALL I'VE GOT NOW ARE MY TONY, SIX EMMYS, MARK TWAIN PRIZE, MY STAR ON THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME AND MY BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT AWARD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU GOT A BLOCKY? (LAUGHTER) YOU SON OF A BITCH!
SON OF A BITCH IS MY LINE, YOU SON OF A BITCH.
Stephen: BILLY! I NEED THE GRAMMY! ALL I'VE GOT NOW IS MY NINE EMMYS, MY TWO PEABODYS AND, OF COURSE, MY GRAMMY. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
Stephen: SHH, YOU'RE SCARING HER! (LAUGHTER) LISTEN, BILLY, WE'RE COLLEAGUES, WHY ARE WE FIGHTING?
BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING CRUSH ME.
Stephen: RIGHT. OKAY. (LAUGHTER) BUT WHAT I REALLY MEANT WAS THAT I JUST HOPE THAT PETE SEEGER DOESN'T WIN.
WHAT AN (BLEEP).
Stephen: YEAH, HE IS. BESIDES HE ALREADY WON THE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT GRAMMY IN 1993.
YES, AND HE KEEPS ON LIVING! IT'S SO SELFISH!
Stephen: BILLY CRYSTAL, I FEEL LIKE I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM YOU TODAY. I HOPE YOU WIN THE GRAMMY.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN. (LAUGHS)
Stephen: BILLY -- IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY TO ME?
I HOPE YOU LOSE. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: YOU SON OF A BITCH!
