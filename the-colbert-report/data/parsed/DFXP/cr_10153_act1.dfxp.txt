STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT -- FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT, BUT THAT IS CHANTING -- THAT CHANTING, THAT INCANTATION OF MY NAME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW PUTS US ON A GLIDEPLATH TO GLORY. YES, I SAID GLIDEPLATH -- IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN GLIDEPATH. FOLKS, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. YOU KNOW I LOVE THE LADIES. IN MY OPINION, IT'S ONE OF THE TOP FIVE SEXES OUT THERE. AND THIS WAS A HUGE WEEKEND IN LADY NEWS. FOR STARTERS -- FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 29008 CAMPAIGN HILLARY CLINTON WAS IN IOWA TO ANNOUNCE THAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT HINTING THAT SHE WAS LEANING TOWARDS MAYBE RUNNING. AND OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW THE CLINTON MACHINE, THEY ANNOUNCED IT PERFECTLY.
I'M BACK!
Stephen: YES, HILLARY'S BACK! AND I THINK THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN THAN WITH A CATCH-PHRASE FROM A 1996 MOVIE.
I'M BACK!
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, RANDY QUAID. YOU WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN. THAT WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS WHEN BILL CLINTON LAUNCHED HIS '92 CAMPAIGN WITH A CATCH PHRASE FROM A 1986 MOVIE.
I [BLEEP] ANYTHING THAT MOVES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, DENNIS HOPPER. OF COURSE, WHILE THERE'S A LOT OF TALK THAT HILLARY COULD BE OUR FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT, THIS PAST WEEKEND WE ONCE AGAIN ELECTED A STRONG FEMALE LEADER.
WELCOME TO THE 2015 MISS AMERICA COMPETITION.
Stephen: YES, MISS AMERICA. THAT ONE MAGICAL NIGHT A YEAR ATLANTIC CITY SHOWS THE WORLD JUST HOW CLOSE IT COULD COME TO TURNING A PROFIT. THE LADIES WERE LOVELY, THE HAIR WAS LOVELY, THE TEETH WERE HIGH AND FIRM. BUT THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT WAS THE POP-UPS DELIVERING FACT DOESOIDS ABOUT THE CONTESTANTS. MISS VIRGINIA WAS TERRIFIED OF FROGS. MISS MASSACHUSETTS WAS ATTACKED BY A CHEETAH IN ZAMBIA. MISS FLORIDA SLAPPED A SHARK AS A KID. SHARK SLAPPING? MY GOD, WHEN DID THAT BECOME A TALENT. SHE COULD HAVE WON IT, FOKLS. AND THIS YEAR'S WINNER WAS MISS NEW YORK. SEEN HER, I BELIEVE-- SEEN HERE, I BELIEVE SHE'S PANHANDLING. NOTHING AGAINST THE LOVELY MISS NEW YORK, BUT FOR MY MONEY BASED ON TALENT ALONE LAST NIGHT'S WINNER WAS MISS OHIO.
SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALI- DOCIOUS. SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALI- DOCIOUS ♪ SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALI- DOCIOUS ♪  SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALI- DOCIOUS ♪ THERE'S YOUR MISS AMERICA RIGHT THERE. THE FLOWING BLONDE MANE. THE ELGANT RED GOWN. THE LEGS. THE WAY SHE CAN SING A WHOLE SONG WITHOUT BLINKING? THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, MADAME. NOW FOLKS, I HAVE BEEN STEEPED IN THE HISTORY OF SCOTLAND EVER SINCE BRAVE CAME OUT ON iTUNES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, MERIDA. THAT'S WHY I'M RIVETED TO ALL THE NEWS FROM THE LANDS OF KILTS AND HAGIS WHERE THIS THURSDAY CITIZENS WILL ♪ WALK 500 MILES AND THEY WALK  500 MORE TO BE THE MAN TO WALK A --♪ (LAUGHTER) FOLKS --  I'LL TAKE IT. THEY'RE VOTING ON THEIR FUTURE.
WE ARE JUST 72 HOURS AWAY FROM A ONCE IN A LIFETIME VOTE ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE.
SCOTLAND WILL VOTE THIS WEEK ON WHETHER TO SEVERE 100-YEAR-OLD TIES WITH BRITAIN AND BECOME AN INDEPENDENT NATION.
AFTER 307 YEAR ITS SCOTLAND COULD BREAK AWAY FROM THE REST OF BRITAIN.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, SCOTLAND COULD ACTUALLY SECEDE. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY  HAD SLAVES. AT ISSUE IS WHETHER SCOTLAND WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN TAX AND SOCIAL SECURITY RATES AND DECISIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL AND ALLOCATION OF PUBLIC SPENDING. THIS IS AN EMOTIONALLY CHARGED STRUGGLE THAT TRACES ITS ROOTS TO THE DAYS OF WILLIAM WALLCE.
THEY MAY TAKE A LIVES BUT THEY'LL NEVER TAKE OUR FREEDOM TO CALCULATE PENSION BENEFITS BASED ON INFLATION OR EARNINGS, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FREEDOM! AND THE STAKES, AND THE STAKES GO FAR BEYOND SCOTLAND. A VOTE FOR SEPARATION WOULD MEAN THE NEAR-CERAIN RESIGNATION OF BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON. SEE, BACK IN 2012 CAMERON AGREED TO THE INDEPENDENCE VOTE AS A CALCULATED GAMBLE. AND IF HE LOSES SCOTLAND, HE'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT UP BY WINNING INDIA BACK AT THE CRAPS TABLE. FOLKS, ANY TIME PEOPLE ARE ANGIRLY DEMANDING SOMETHING AND I DON'T ENTIRELY UNDERSTAND WHY -- I AM WITH THEM.  AS AN IRISH AMERICAN I KNEW ALL TOO WELL, WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SUFFER UNDER THE BOOT OF AN INDIFFERENT MONARCHY. ANSWER MY LETTERS, PRINCE. I WOULD DIE 4 U. AND IT IS LOOKING GOOD FOR THE PRO INDEPENDENCE YES SCOTLAND CAMPAIGN. THE POLLS WERE RUNNING AGAINST SECESSION UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN 47% OF THOSE SURVEYED SAID YES TO INDEPENDENCE WHILE 45% SAID NO, WHILE ANOTHER 8% SAID SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE OUTSIDE OF GLASGOW COULD POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND. I'M NOT SAYING THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE WON'T HAVE A WEE BUMP. FOR INSTANCE, SCOTLAND WANTS TO KEEP USING THE BRITISH POUND. BUT ENGLAND'S CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER SAYS NO FARTHING WAY.
SCOTLAND WALKS AWAY FROM THE U.K., IT WALKS AWAY FROM THE POUND.
Stephen: MEANING THE NEW COUNTRY WOULD HAVE TO REVERT TO TRADITIONAL SCOTTISH CURRENCY, SLABS OF PEAT MOSS STAMPED WITH SEAN CONNERY'S FACE. (LAUGHTER) FIVE [BLEEP] JOBBIES! FIVE [BLEEP] JOBBIES! BUT SCOTLAND IS TOTALLY READY TO ROCK OUT WITH ITS LOCH OUT. THE SCOTS SHACKED UP BACK IN 1706 AFTER THEY WENT BROKE  TRYING CON COLONIZE PANAMA. BUT NOW, THE TABLES HAVE TURNED. IN THE LAST 32 YEARS, SCOTLAND HAS GENERATED MORE TAX PER CAPITA THAN THE U.K. AS A WHOLE. SO ON THEIR OWN, THEY WOULD BE ONE OF THE WORLD'S 20 WEALTHIEST COUNTRIES. I NO IDEA THEY SOLD THAT MUCH ADHESIVE TAPE. SO I STAND WITH MY SECESSIONIST BROTHERS. TODAY, I STEPHEN COLBERT, AM A PROUD SCOTSMAN ICH BIN EIN EDINBURGHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW AND NOW (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SCOTLAND'S ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE IS SURE TO BE A BREEZE. HERE TO TELL ME JUST HOW BREEZY IT'S GOING TO BE IS ASSISTANT U.S. EDITOR OF THE GUARDIAN MATT WELLS. MATT, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. MATT, GUARDIAN, GREAT ENGLISH NEWSPAPER. DO YOU THINK THAT SCOTLAND SHOULD SECEDE?
YES, I THINK SCOTLAND SHOULD SUCCEED AND SECEDE.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
LOOK, THE UNION HAS LASTED 307 YEARS. AND FOR MUCH OF THAT TIME IT'S BRITAIN AND SCOTLAND VERY WELL INDEED. BUT THE TIES THAT BAND THE UNION TOGETHER THINGS LIKE THE BRITISH EMPIRE, THE SHARED SENSE OF BRITISH STATEHOOD THAT WENT WITH A CENTURY OF FIGHTING TWO WORLD WARS, THEY HAVE FADED NOW. AND THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPLACED THEM AND FEEL DISTANT AND DISCREDITED.
Stephen: BUT WILL IT BE GOOD FOR EVERYBODY? FOR THEM TO SECEDE?
YEAH.
Stephen: IS THAT GOING TO BE POSITIVE FOR SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND?
IT WILL BE VERY GOOD FOR SCOTLAND. AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE BAD FOR ENGLAND. THE GDP OF SCOTLAND IS PER CAPITA $2,300 POUNDS GREATER THAN IT IS IN ENGLAND.
Stephen: IS THAT IN METRIC BECAUSE I DON'T CONVERT.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT IN INCHES.
SCOTLAND IS A LOW POPULATION, RESOURCE RICH COUNTRY. WE HAVE A GREAT RESOURCES NORTH SEA OIL. THERE ARE VERY MUCH UNTAPPED ROOT RESOURCES.
Stephen: DO YOU WISH DAVID CAMERON HARM? (LAUGHTER)
NO. I MEAN THE GUARDIAN IS A PROGRESSIVE LEFT-WING NEWSPAPER.
Stephen: YOU WOULD LIKE TO STICK A KNIFE IN HIM.
AND WE HAVE --
Stephen: THAT'S WHY YOU SEE CHAOS. WOULD THIS BE CHAOS FOR THE PEOPLE IN ENGLAND?
I THINK WILL BE DIFFICULT.
Stephen: IS THAT AN ENGLISH WORD FOR FIREBOMBING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. DIFFICULT, WHAT DOES DIFFICULT MEAN IN ENGLAND.
FRANKLU IT WILL BE CATACLYSMIC FOR THEM.
Stephen: CATACLYSMIC FOR THEM. SO WANT THIS BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD STORY FOR YOU.
IT WILL BE A GREAT STORY.
Stephen: YOU'RE OPEN TO THE SES SESSION THE SAME REASON PEOPLE WATCH NASCAR.
DAVID CAMERON--
Stephen: HOPING THAT THE CAR WILL JUST SLAM INTO THE WALL. YOU'RE CUTTING THE BRABLING CABLES OF SCOTLAND.
DAVID CAMERON STAKED HIS REPUTATION ON SAVING THE UNION. HE WAS THE ONE WHO GRANTED THE REFERENDUM IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS HIS DECISION TO MAKE THE SLATE YES OR NO QUESTION.
Stephen: WHY DID HE DO THAT? WHY DID HE DO THAT?
-- A MASSIVE POLITICAL MISCALCULATION WHICH NOW LOOKS AS IF IT MIGHT BACKFIRE IN HIS FACE.
Stephen: WHY DID HE DO IT?
BECAUSE AT THE POLLS AT THE TIME SUGGESTED THAT ONLY 30% OF PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND SUPPORTED INDEPENDENCE. DAVID CAMERON, IN WHAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WAS POLITICAL ARROGANCE, THOUGHT THAT HE COULD EASILY WIN. THAT THE MASS SERADE RANKS OF THE THREE POLITICLA PARTIES WOULD BE UNITED AGAINST THE UPSTART NATIONALISTS. THEY WOULD BE EASILY DEFEATED.
Stephen: COULD THE QUEEN HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO STOP IT? WHAT IF SHE HAD WORN A DIFFERENT HAT?
YES.
Stephen: OR WAVED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY OR SOMETHING.
THE ROLE OF THE QUEEN IS REALLY INTERESTING AND WHETHER, AN HER VIEWS AS WELL.
Stephen: WHERE DOES SHE FALL ON THIS.
SHE DID INTERVENE IN THE DEBATE ON SUNDAY COMING OUT OF CHURCH NEAR HER ESTATE IN SCOTLAND WHERE SHE SPENDS THE SUMMER, BALMORAL. SHE SAID TO A WELL WISHER WHO ASKED HER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THE SCOTISH REFERENDUM -- A MEMBER OF THE  PUBLIC, OVERHEARD BY THE PRESS -- SHE SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT SCOTS VOTING ON THURSDAY SHOULD THINK VERY CAREFULLY  INDEED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE.
Stephen: OH MY GOD. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT IS A SMACKDOWN FROM THE QUEEN. THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF SAYING WELL, DO YOU FEEL LUCKY, PUNK? MATT, THANK YOU SO MUCH. MATT WELLS FROM THE GUARDIAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (BAGPIPES) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
