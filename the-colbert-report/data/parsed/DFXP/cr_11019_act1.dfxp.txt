Stephen: TONIGHT, I PROFILE ONE OF CONGRESS' LAST REMAINING DEMOCRATS. I'LL ASK HER HOW SHE PLANS TO REPOPULATE THE SPECIES. THEN BIG CHANGES COME TO THE SENATE. NOW IT'S RUN BY A TOTALLY DIFFERENT OLD WHITE GUY. ( LAUGHTER ) AND MY GUEST TONIGHT IS DEMOCRATIC NEW YORK SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND. I'LL ASK HER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO PANDER TO THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A NEW YORK DOCTOR INFECTED WITH EBOLA IS REPORTEDLY NOW WELL ENOUGH TO PLAY THE BANJO. PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED WISHING HIM A SPEEDY RECOVERY. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. I HAVE TO TELL YOU AFTER A GREETING LIKE THAT I WOULD NOT KICK YOU OUT OF BED FOR EATING CRACKERS, FOLKS. LET'S GET RIGHT TO THE BIG STORY, LAST NIGHT'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS. HUGE NIGHT FOR THE REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THEY WON EVERYTHING. THE SENATE MAJORITY, THE BIGGER HOUSE MAJORITY, TIGHT GOVERNORS' RACES AND A GIRAFFE FROM ONE OF THOSE CLAW MACHINES. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, THEY WERE ON FIRE. I DON'T KNOW WHY DEMOCRATS DIDN'T TURN OUT TO VOTE YESTERDAY. WHAT WITH ALL THE INSPIRING FUND-RAISING E-MAILS THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE SENT OUT, LIKE "ALL HOPE IS LOST." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND SURE, AS A CONSERVATIVE IT IS TEMPTING TO GLOAT, BUT I'M GOING TO BE HUMBLE ABOUT THIS FOR TWO REASONS. ONE, BECAUSE I AM AMAZING AT BEING HUMBLE, OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) FANTASTIC. AND, TWO, I WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO ALL MY LIBERAL VIEWERS. I HAVE BEEN TOLD SOME LIBERALS DO WATCH THE SHOW. I DON'T KNOW WHY. IT'S A FREE COUNTRY. AS HAPPY AS I AM THAT AMERICA IS NOW HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, I'M NOT GOING TO SPIKE THE METAPHORICAL FOOTBALL OR EVEN THE LITERAL FOOTBALL I HAD MADE WITH OBAMA'S FACE ON IT RIGHT THERE, OKAY. NOT WORTH IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WOULDN'T BE RIGHT. I'M ALSO NOT GOING TO HAVE A BALLOON DROP BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE TACKY. JIM, LET'S CANCEL THE BALLOON DROP. LET'S JUST CLEAR THE BALLOONS OUT OF THAT NET AND GET ALL VICTORY MUSIC OUT OF SPEAKERS. COME ON, GET RIT RID OF IT, GET IT OUT OF THERE.  ♪  ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOOO! WHOOO! ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT, OKAY? THERE'S A TIME FOR ALL THAT LATER, MAYBE AFTER THE NEXT COMMERCIAL BREAK. , OF COURSE, THERE ARE A HAND FULL OF DEMOCRATS WHO DID KEEP THEIR JOBS LAST NIGHT. FOR INSTANCE, THE SUBJECT OF THE 81st INSTALLMENT OF MY 434-PART SERIES, "BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT." TONIGHT CALIFORNIA'S 13th, THE FIGHTIN' 13th! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CALIFORNIA'S 13th COVERS A LONG STRETCH OF CALIFORNIA'S EAST BAY, MAKING IT HOME TO BOTH THE OAKLAND ATHLETICS, AND THE BERKELEY NON-ATHLETICS. ( LAUGHTER ) FAMED CARTOONIST RUBE GOLDBERG GRADUATED FROM U.C. BERKELEY WITH AN ENGINEERING DEGREE IN 1904, THOUGH HE DIDN'T GET IT HOWNG HIS WALL UNTIL 1932. THE DISTRICT IS ALSO HOME TO COMPANY HEADQUARTERS FOR CLIF BAR AND NORTHFACE CLOTHING, ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS FOR BOTH CALIFORNIA'S RUGGED OUTDOORSMEN AND DRUGGED INDOORSMEN. ROCKER JIM MORRISON ATTENDED HIGH SCHOOL IN THE 13th TOWN OF ALAMEDA. THOUGH, LIKE MANY TEENAGERS, HIS HIGH SCHOOL BAND MAINLY JUST PLAYED DOORS COVERS. AND WHO HAS THE SLIGIN' BERKEN STOCKS TO REPRESENT THIS DISTRICT? IT'S NONE OTHER THAN CONGRESSMAN BARBARA LEE. I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE LEE IN HER WASHINGTON OFFICE. CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU.
Stephen: CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA LEE. MAY I CALL YOU BABS?
JEANIE OR BEBE, PLEASE.
Stephen: OK, JEANIE OR BEBE
OR BARBARA.
Stephen: BABS, TELL ME ABOUT THE LUCKY 13th.
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY.
THE MOST--
VERY CREATIVE, VERY PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE.
Stephen: YOUR DISTRICT INCLUDES WHAMO TOYS, MAKERS OF HULA HOOPS AND SILLY STRING. IT ALSO INCLUDES OAKLAND WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE CITIES IN THE AMERICA WITH MORE THAN 125 LANGUAGES SPOKEN.
ISN'T THAT GREAT.
Stephen: THAT'S INCREDIBLE. CAN YOU TRANSLATE THIS   LOCAL EXPRESSION? IMA HITTA BLEEZY AND SOME YAY START PERKIN, GET HELLA HYPHY AND GHOST RIDE MY WHIP.
WHAT LANGUAGE IS THAT?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. DID I SAY THAT RIGHT? I'VE BEEN TOLD I SAID THAT RIGHT.
GREAT, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A LINGUIST.
I'M A CUNNING LINGUIST. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
Stephen:  THANK YOU.
Stephen: GERTRUDE STEIN FAMOUSLY SAID OF OAKLAND, "THERE IS NO THERE, THERE." CONGRESSWOMAN, IS THERE, THERE, THERE?
THERE'S A LOT THERE.
Stephen: IT SAYS OAKLAND IS THE THIRD LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF LESBIANS IN THE COUNTRY. ARE YOU SURE THAT'S AN ACCURATE COUNT? SOMETIMES THEY GET ALL TANGLED UP AND IT'S HARD TO TELL, HOW MANY TO TELL HOW MANY LESBIANS THERE ARE IN THAT PILE.
OAKLAND IS A VERY OPEN AND BEAUTIFUL SEA.
Stephen: BEING JUST A FEW MILES FROM SAN FRANCISCO, WHICH IS A HOMOSEXUAL MECCA, IS THERE A LOT OF LESBIAN SPILLOVER?
PEOPLE COME TO OAKLAND. EVERYONE COMES TO OAKLAND BECAUSE THEY LOVE LIVING IN OAKLAND.
Stephen: OAKLAND COLISEUM IS WHERE THE WAVE WAS INVENTED.
I TOLD YOU OAKLAND WAS REALLY COOL.
REALLY ALTHOUGH, COOL PEOPLE. DO YOU WANT TO GET A WAVE STARTED HERE?
OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ( LAUGHTER )   ( CHEERS )
Stephen: WOW. THAT WAS EXCITING.
FUN.
Stephen: HERE'S A FUN FACT-- YOU ARE A TRAITOR BECAUSE YOU INFAMOUSLY WERE THE LONE DISSENTING VOICE FOR THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE, THE UMAF, AFTER THE TERROR ATTACKS IN 2001. HOW COULD YOU STAND UP THERE AND SAY I LOVE AL QAEDA? HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT ON THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS?
I NEVER SAID THAT. IT WAS A BLANK CHECK.
Stephen: YES.
TO WAGE PERPETUAL WAR THAT THE CONGRESS GAVE TO ANY PRESIDENT UNTIL WE REPEAL IT, AND I WANT TO REPEAL IT.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT TERRORISM? THE PAT-DOWNS AT THE AIRPORTS. I DON'T EVEN WEAR UNDERWEAR ANYMORE.
WE SHOULD HAVE A DEBATE IN CONGRESS SO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE COSTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF GOING TO WAR FOREVER IF THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.
Stephen: I'LL BE EVERYONE ELSE IN CONGRESS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I THINK WE SHOULD BOMB THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KILL US. A REBUTTAL.
IS IT GOING TO MAKE US SAFER OR LESS SAFE?
Stephen: IT'S GOING TO MAKE THEM DEADER, THAT'S GOOD  ENOUGH FOR ME.  >>IN 5 YEARS, DO WE HAVE ISIS 2?
Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR ALTERNATIVE FOR STOPPING ISIS, WRITING SOME PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE NOTE. "HEY, YOU GUYS, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S A BAD THING YOU'RE DOING OVER THERE, NOT ME, BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE COOL, BUT OTHER PEOPLE THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOUR REPUTATION IF YOU STOPPED. P.S., ARE YOU GOING TO THE PARTY TOGETHER, LET'S GO TOGETHER?
NO WAY.
Stephen:  LET'S MOVE ON. IT SAYS HERE YOU WERE ON THE ADOPTION CAUCUS. WERE YOU TEMPTED TO FIND OUT YOUR BIOLOGICAL CAUCUS?
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A BIOLOGICAL CAUCUS.
Stephen: REALLY?
I DON'T THINK SO. I'LL CHECK.
Stephen: YOU ARE ON THE URBAN CAUCUS. AREN'T YOU A LIFETIME MEMBER OF THE URBAN CAUCUS?
LIFETIME MEMBER OF THE URBAN-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
Stephen: AREN'T YOU GRANDFATHERED INTO THE URBAN CAUCUS?
GRANDFATHERED IN? WE RUN EVERY TWO YEARS. IN THE ELECTIONS.
Stephen: RIGHT, OKAY.
YOU CAN ONLY TAKE IT TWO YEARS AT A TIME.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY "URBAN."
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
Stephen:  URBAN.
LIKE WHERE I LIVE WHERE WE HAVE SIDEWALKS.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, URBAN PEOPLE.
I LIVE IN A BEAUTIFUL CITY.
Stephen: I DON'T SEE RACE, BUT I DO SEE URBAN. ARE YOU URBAN?
I LIVE IN AN URBAN COMMUNITY. I DON'T LIVE IN AN URBAN COMMUNITY, ALTHOUGH I LOVE RURAL COMMUNITIES. I LIVE IN AN URBAN COMMUNITY.
Stephen: YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE BLACK PANTHERS IN COLLEGE. WAS THAT ANOTHER FREE LOVE GROUP.
I WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE BLACK PANTHERS
Stephen: THEY WOULDN'T LET YOU IN?
I DIDN'T EVEN APPLY. I WORKED ON COMMUNITY PROGRAMS, LIKE THE SCHOOLS
Stephen: SO YOU NEVER OFFICIALLY JOINED THE BLACK PANTHERS.
NEVER.
DOES THAT MEAN YOU CAN ONLY RAISE YOUR FIST THIS HIGH?
THAT'S A QUESTION I CAN'T EVEN ANSWER BECAUSE IT'S SO STUPID.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  YOU SPONSORED A BILL TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS FOR COMPREHENSIVE SEX EDUCATION. HOW COMPREHENSIVE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE BECAUSE THERE IS SOME CRAZY STUFF ON THE INTERNET I WOULDN'T WANT KIDS TO FIND OUT ABOUT.
PUBLIC SCHOOLS SHOULD BE ABLE TO TEACH KIDS HOW TO PREVENT UNWANTED PREGNANCIES AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE.
Stephen: BUT WHEN WE WERE KIDS-- ( APPLAUSE ) SEX WAS SO MUCH SIMPLER. THERE WAS THIS WAY, THAT WAY, THAT THING, LADY ON TOP, AND YOU WERE DONE. NOW, IT'S SO COMPLICATED. WE DON'T WANT TO BURDEN THESE KIDS WITH COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION ABOUT IT. LET'S JUST SAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S SOMETHING NOT VERY NICE THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED, AND ALSO DON'T DO IT. AND JUST BE BE DONE RIGHT THERE.
KIDS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HEALTH CARE.
Stephen: WHY NOT COMPREHENSIVE ABSTINENCE EDUCATION?
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT'S THE ONLY WAY.
Stephen: SOME THIS PERSON.
YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ALL THE OPTIONS SO THAT THEY CAN BE EDUCATED.
Stephen: I'M PRACTICING ABSTINENCE RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK.
MORE POWER TO YOU.
Stephen: THAT COULD CHANGE IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT.
GEEZ, MY GOD.
Stephen: I'M JUST SAYING
YOU ARE REALLY CRAZY.
Stephen: AM I THE ONLY ONE? CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE FEELING THIS RIGHT NOW.
GEEZ.
Stephen: THE TENSION IN HERE IS SO THICK.
OH MY GOD I MEAN IT IS-- IT HANGS LIKE A THICK MUSK IN THE AIR RIGHT NOW.
YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR HEAD.
Stephen: REALLY.
YEAH.
Stephen: ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH.
Stephen: ARE YOU SURE.
I'M POSITIVE.
Stephen: TURN THE CAMERAS OFF. ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION. CONGRESSWOMAN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO CELEBRATE YOUR DISTRICT WITH ME?
SURE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ♪  ♪
Stephen: CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: LET'S PUT CALIFORNIA'S 13th UP ON THE BIG BOARD! OH, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE TOOK JIM MORRISON UP ON HIS OFFER TO LIGHT HIS FIRE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
