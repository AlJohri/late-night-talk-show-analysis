STEPHEN:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT SPENT 43 YEARS IN THE NAVY. THAT'S EVEN LONGER THAN THAT GUY FROM THE VILLAGE PEOPLE. PLEASE WELCOME ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ADMIRAL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. HONOR TO HAVE YOU, SIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. NOW, YOU'RE RETIRED U.S. NAVY ADMIRAL. YOU SERVED AS THE 17TH CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF. THAT'S A BIG JOB. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, I ASSUME YOU'RE ON BOARD WITH BILL O'REILLY'S 25,000-MAN MERCENARY ARMY. DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH, 25,000 PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD WHO GET TAUGHT ENGLISH AND ARE PAID VERY WELL, OR THE U.S. ARMED FORCES? WHICH WOULD YOU PICK? AND, PLEASE, DON'T LET YOUR YEARS AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS INFLUENCE YOU IN THIS DECISION. THINK OBJECTIVELY ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND. MERCENARY ARMY-U.S. ARMED FORCES. YOU HAD TO PICK, WHICH WOULD IT BE?
IT WOULD BE THIS ONE.
STEPHEN:  OKAY, ALL RIGHT. BILL IS NOT GOING TO LIKE THAT. THE MAN HAS A MERCENARY ARMY. I WOULDN'T CROSS HIM.
I KNOW.
STEPHEN:  SO WE'RE IN SYRIA NOW, AND WE'RE-- WE OFFICIALLY DON'T HAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND BUT WE HAVE ADVISERS ON THE GROUND?
ACTUALLY, NOT IN SYRIA. WE HAVE ADVISERS ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ, ABOUT 1600 OF THEM.
STEPHEN:  HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN WESTERN IRAQ AND SYRIA AT THIS POINT? THERE A BORDER?
I THINK IT'S JUST ACTUALLY IN NAME ONLY. I MEAN, THAT PART OF THE DESERT IS WIDE OPEN, AND AS FAR AS ISIL RIGHT NOW, THEY CONTROL AN AWFUL LOT OF TERRITORY, BOTH IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. THEY'VE CALLED IT THE BEGINNING OF THE CALIPHATE, IF YOU WILL, AND THEIR STATE THAT THEY'VE ESTABLISHED, WHICH I DON'T THINK HAS ANY SUBSTANTIAL UNDERPINNING IN TERMS OF REALITY INTERNATIONAL OR ANYTHING LIKE, THAT BUT IT'S WHAT THEY CLAIM.
STEPHEN:  THEY USED TO BE THE ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. NOW THEY'RE JUST THE ISLAMIC STATE?
RIGHT.
STEPHEN:  THEY'RE LIKE CHER. THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT FANS OF CHER. ( LAUGHTER ) HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO BE DOING THIS?
WELL, MY-- MY VIEW OF THAT IS IN 2011 WHEN EGYPT STARTED TO UNFOLD AND THE REVOLUTION THERE, I SAID THEN AND I STILL THINK IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD, WE'RE IN A 30- TO 40-YEAR RUN HERE.
STEPHEN:  30 TO 40 YEARS?
CORRECT.
STEPHEN:  SO LIKE THE COLD WAR.
IN TERMS OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE CHANGE AND THE UNCERTAINTY AND THE INSTABILITY. AND I THINK IT'S JUST CASCADED FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER.
STEPHEN:  DO YOU THINK AMERICA'S REPUTATION IN THE WORLD BECAUSE OF THE MILITARY ENGAGEMENT WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST 13 YEARS IS DAMAGED?
I DO. I DO. I THINK IN FACT-- I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE I COULD ASK THAT WOULD GET THE CORRECT ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WHICH IS HAVING BOMBED SYRIA, HOW MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES HAVE WE BOMBED? THIS IS OUR SEVENTH.
STEPHEN:  YEAH, YEAH, ONE MORE AND WE GET A FREE FALAFAL. HERE'S ONE THING. LET'S TALK ABOUT MILITARY-- LET'S TALK. A REAL SUCCESSFUL MILITARY MISSION THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD FEEL GREAT ABOUT, AND THAT'S WHEN WE WENT AND GOT BIN LADEN. YOU WERE IN THE ROOM WHEN THAT THING WAS GOING DOWN. AND YOU HAD TO BE THE ONE TO CALL THE HEAD OF THE PAKISTANI MILITARY.
CORRECT.
STEPHEN:  TO SAY THAT WE GOT HIM.
RIGHT.
STEPHEN:  HOW WAS THAT? ( LAUGHTER ) DID YOU SAY, "HI, IT'S MIKE. WE FOUND BIN LADEN. GUESS WHERE?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) WAS HE CHAGRINED?
NO.
STEPHEN:  WERE THEY CHAGRINED AT ALL?
HE WAS-- HE WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISED. I MEAN, LITERALLY. NOW, THIS IS IN THE HUMAN DIMENSION. I KNOW THIS DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE, BUT I KNEW HIM PRETTY WELL, AND HIS REACTION WAS SURPRISE, ONE, THAT WE'D FOUND HIM, AND, TWO, THAT HE WAS WHERE WE FOUND HIM, WHICH WAS ABOUT A MILE FROM THEIR-- THEIR VERSION OF WEST POINT. AND HE HAD THE WORST WEEK OF HIS LIFE --
STEPHEN:  NOT AS BAD AS BIN LADEN'S.
NO, I KNOW.
STEPHEN:  DO YOU EVER GET TIRED OF THE MIDDLE EAST? DO YOU EVER WANT TO JUST THROW UP YOUR HANDS AND GO BACK TO BED
NO.
STEPHEN:  NO?
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS SORT OF AN OVER-ARCHING STRATEGY AND PLAN FOR THE MIDDLE EAST COUNTRY BY COUNTRY, AND THEN EVEN IN THE REGIONAL SENSE PER SE. AND I THINK HAVING THAT AND HAVING A VIEW OF THAT WOULD THEN ALLOW EVERYBODY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY COULD CONTRIBUTE IF IT'S ANOTHER COUNTRY, OR WE COULD CONTRIBUTE, EVEN INSIDE OUR OWN COUNTRY.
STEPHEN:  CAN I TELL YOU WHY I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MIGHT BE TIRED OF IT? AND WANT TO GO BACK TO BED? AND I'M SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, AND, THEREFORE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IS BECAUSE-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'RE-- WE'RE ASKED TO BE AFRAID OF IT. YOU GET TO THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME OR YOU DID GET TO THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME AND SAY TO YOURSELF, YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT LITTLE CORNER OF THE DESERT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BLOW UP REAL GOOD, LET'S GO OVER THERE. WHEREAS, WE'RE ASKED TO BE AFRAID OF IT, AND WE'RE REMINDED TO BE AFRAID OF IT, BUT WE NO LONGER HAVE MUCH OF A VOICE IN IT BECAUSE OUR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES WON'T VOTE OR WHETHER WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. WE'RE NOT ASKED TO SACRIFICE THAT MUCH FOR IT. VERY FEW OF US GO FIGHT. AND WE'RE ALSO NOT TOLD ALL THAT MUCH ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER THERE. SO ALL WE HAVE IS THE FEAR, AND NONE OF THE ACTION.
RIGHT.
STEPHEN:  AND SO WE EVENTUALLY WANT TO STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. AND THAT'S WHY THAT 25,000-MAN MERCENARY ARMY STARTS TO SOUND GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WE ALSO-- ( APPLAUSE ) WE ALSO WANT TO STOP CARING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR MEN AND WOMEN WHO GO OVER THERE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO SACRIFICE FOR SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T THINK IS RIGHT. AND YET WE DON'T HAVE MUCH VOICE IN IT ANYMORE.   ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS )
SO YOU BRING UP A CONCERN THAT I HAVE WITH RESPECT TO A GROWING DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN THIS ALL-VOLUNTEER FORCE, WHO ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN. THEY'RE LESS THAN 1% OF THE POPULATION. THEY COME FROM FEWER AND FEWER PLACES IN AMERICA. AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE TO BUY INTO THESE WARS, AS YOU SAID-- AND I AGREE WITH THAT-- AND CERTAINLY THE VAST, VAST MAJORITY DIDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT IN THEM, DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE AS A MILITARY. AND IN FACT-- AND I'VE SAID THIS MANY TIMES, WHAT I ACTUALLY DO WORRY ABOUT IS THAT WE BECOME SOME VERSION OF SOMETHING LIKE THE FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION, WHICH IS PLEASE GO OFF AND FIGHT OUR DIRTY LITTLE WARS AND LET US GET ON WITH OUR LIVES. AND I THINK THAT'S A DISASTER FOR AMERICA. WE NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE NEED TO DO THAT THROUGH THE SYSTEM THAT'S HERE, THOSE THAT ARE ELECTED, AND I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THOSE WHO ARE ELECTED OUGHT TO VOTE ON WHAT WE DO. AND WE OUGHT TO-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IF I CAN MAKE-- AND WE OUGHT TO HAVE A FULSOME, RAGING DEBATE ABOUT THAT IN THIS COUNTRY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
STEPHEN:  ADMIRAL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
