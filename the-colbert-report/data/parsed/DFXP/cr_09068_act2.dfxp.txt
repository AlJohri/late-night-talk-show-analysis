EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION -- THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] EARLIER THIS MONTH JOHN KERRY  WAS SWORN IN AS SECRETARY OF  STATE, AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS MET WITH A RESOUNDING, "YEAH,  OKAY." [LAUGHTER] AND ON SUNDAY, HE EMBARKED ON A  TEN-DAY, NINE-NATION MARATHON  THAT I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE DID NOT INCLUDE HIS HOMELAND OF  EASTER ISLAND. [LAUGHTER] BUT IN GERMANY, I WAS PROUD TO  SEE HE MADE THE CASE FOR  AMERICAN GREATNESS.
PEOPLE HAVE SOMETIMES  WONDERED ABOUT WHY OUR SUPREME  COURT ALLOWS ONE GROUP OR ANOTHER TO MARCH IN A PARADE  EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE MOST  PROVOCATIVE THING IN THE WORLD AND THEY CARRY SIGNS THAT ARE AN  INSULT TO ONE GROUP OR ANOTHER. THE REASON IS, THAT'S FREEDOM. FREEDOM OF SPEECH. IN AMERICA YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO  BE STUPID. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: YES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YES. IN THIS COUNTRY WE'RE ENDOWED. WITH THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO BE  STUPID. IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE  CONSTITUTION BETWEEN THE PENIS  DOODLE AND THE RANCH DRESSING  STAIN. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND JOHN KERRY DOESN'T JUST TALK  THE DUMB TALK, HE WALKS THE DUMB  WALK. BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT HE SAID LAST  WEEK.
THE BRAVE EMPLOYEES OF STATE  IN USAID THE DIPLOMATIC SECURITY  PERSONNEL WHO PROTECT THE CIVILIANS SERVING AS OVERSEAS  WORK IN SOME OF THE MOST  DANGEROUS PLACES ON EARTH. THEY SUPPORT DEMOCRATIC  INSTITUTIONS IN KYRGYZIKSTAN IN  GEORGIA.
Stephen: YES, KYRGYZIKSTAN. KYRGYZIKSTAN: IT DOES NOT EXIST. KERRY WAS ACTUALLY REFERRING TO  KYRGYZSTAN AND ACCIDENTALLY  MIXED IT UP WITH ITS NEIGHBOR KAZAKHSTAN. I MEAN, KYR-ZAKH-STAN? COURSE, HE'S GOTTEN SOME RIBBING  IN THE PRESS FOR MAKING UP A NEW  COUNTRY. AND IT'S WELL DESERVED. I MEAN, HOW COULD ANYONE EVER  CONFUSE KAZAKHSTAN WITH ITS  NEIGHBOR KYRGYZSTAN? [LAUGHTER] SURE, BOTH COUNTRIES ENJOY  FERMENTED HORSE MILK, AND THEY  BOTH SLEEP IN YAK-HIDE YURTS-- [LAUGHTER] BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS IN  KYRGYZSTAN, THEY PLAY A FRETLESS  STRINGED INSTRUMENT CALLED THE QOMUZ WHICH IS NOTHING LIKE  KAZAKHSTAN'S DOMBRA, ALSO A  FRETLESS STRINGED INSTRUMENT, [LAUGHTER] BUT WITH A SLIGHTLY THINNER  NECK. [LAUGHTER] AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,  KERRY? GO TO DOWNTOWN BISHKEK AND TRY  TO USE A BUNCH OF TENGE TO BUY A  NEW KALPAK? [LAUGHTER] NOT WITHOUT FIRST EXCHANGING IT  INTO SOUMS. YOU'RE NOT! WHAT A MAROON! QUIT EMBARRASSING YOURSELF,  KERRY. LIKE BAI, THE IMPERIOUS RICH MAN  OF KHAZAKH FOLKLORE WHO WAS  TRICKED INTO TRADING HIS WARM COAT FOR ONE FULL OF HOLES  BY THE BEGUILING ALDAR KOSE. AM I RIGHT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN, WHAT AN IDIOT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
