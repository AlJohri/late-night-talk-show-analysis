Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.   ( CHEERS ) IN HERE, OUT THERE. MR. AND MRS.  AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HEROES. FOLKS, FOLKS, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW, WE ARE STILL COUNTING DOWN TO THE LAST EPISODE OF THE REPORT. AFTER TONIGHT, AFTER TONIGHT, THERE ARE TWO SHOWS LEFT. TOMORROW, WHO KNOWS? ( LAUGHTER ) AND FOR A SECOND, IT LOOKED LIKE ENDING MY SHOW IN 2014 WOULD KEEP ME FROM COVERING THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RACE. BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT'S ONLY TRUE IF I CARE ABOUT BEING ACCURATE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND LUCKILY FOR ME, 2016 CAME EARLY THIS YEAR.
BREAKING NEWS JUST IN, JEB BUSH MAKING IT OFFICIAL-- WELL, OFFICIALLY EXPLORING A RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
HE HAS DECIDED TO ACTIVELY EXPLORE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016.
JEB BUSH IS TWEETING AS WE SPEAK. HE JUST TWEETED, "I AM EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE I WILL ACTIVELY EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES."
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT, JEB "NO W" BUSH HAS NOW FORMED A PRESIDENTIAL EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE, WHICH MAKES TWO IF YOU COUNT THE ONE HE WAS BORN INTO. ( LAUGHTER ) EXCUSE ME, I'M-- I'M JUST GETTING A LITTLE EMOTIONAL. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D LIVE TO SEE AMERICA'S FIRST THIRD BUSH PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THIS IS A HUGE RELIEF, FOLKS, BECAUSE JEB HAS BEEN TEASING US ABOUT RUNNING FOR YEARS. AFTER THE 2012 ELECTIONS, HE CRUSHED OUR DREAMS SAYING HE'D MISSEDS HIS WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE 2012 HAD BEEN HIS TIME. THEN LAST NOVEMBER, HE LIFTED THE NATION'S HOPES, PROMISING "I'M GOING TO NOT THINK ABOUT IT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR. THEN I'M GOING TO THINK ABOUT IT REALLY HARD." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH. YEAH.   ( CHEERS ) I MEAN, I MEAN, THINK REALLY HARD? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HEARD A BUSH SAY THAT? ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, IT TURNS OUT ALL THIS TIME JEB WAS JUST WORKING THROUGH THE FIVE STAGES OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT-- DENIAL, THINKING, ACCEPTANCE OF MONEY FROM DONORS, VACATIONING IN IOWA, AND THEN THE FINAL TRAGIC STAGE, PANCAKES. ( LAUGHTER ) RUN, JEB, RUN. NOW, NATION, I GOTTA TELL YOU, TONIGHT I AM AS HAPPY AS A PIG IN A CANDY STORE THAT ALLOWS PIGS. JIM, TELL THE PEOPLE WHY.
GAS PRICES HAVE DROPPED TO THEIR LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 2009.
A FEW SPENT, WHAT, $80 FILLING UP YOUR S.U.V. NOW YOU'RE SPENDING $60.
LOOK AT THE SIGN, $2.07 FOR A GALLON OF REGULAR.
YOU SEE GAS BELOW $2 IN THIS PLACES.
YOU CAN FIND GAS FOR LESS THAN $2 IN 13 STATES.
Stephen:  LESS THAN $2 A GALLON. THAT IS SO CHEAP. NOW, I DON'T JUST FILL UP MY TANK. I FILL UP THE WHOLE DAMN CAR. IT'S DANGEROUS. IT'S EXCITING, BUT IT'S DANGEROUS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SO WHY THE SUDDEN DROP IN GAS PRICES? TV, TALK.
OIL PRICES BASICALLY IN A FREEFALL SINCE OPEC DECIDED NOT TO SCALE BACK PRODUCTION.
WHAT'S HAPPENING, BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF THE U.S. OIL PRODUCERS, OPEC IS TRYING TO FLOOD THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID WE'LL STEAL BUSINESS FROM THEM.
OIL PRODUCTION HERE HAS SOARED MORE THAN 70% IN THE PAST SIX YEARS, SPURRED BY NEW HYDRAULIC FRACKING.
WHAT IS THE CARTEL HAS DONE IS EFFECTIVELY START A PRICE WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.
OIL WAR.
OIL WAR.
Stephen:  OIL WAR, IT'S AMERICA'S DEAD DINOSAURS VERSUS SAUDI ARABIA'S DEAD DINOSAURS. STEVEN SPIELBERG, RETURN MY CALLS. YOU SEE, FOLKS, IN RESPONSE TO AMERICA BECOMING RICH-ASS MOTHER FRACKERS, OPEC IS FIRING ITS FIRST SALVO IN THIS WAR BY OPENING THE TAPS, ALLOWING THE PRICE OF CRUDE TO FALL TO A LEVEL AT WHICH A LOT OF AMERICAN COMPANIES WOULD LOSE MONEY ON THEIR SHALE OPERATIONS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? IF THE FRACKING BUSINESS GOES BUST, NORTH DAKOTA COULD BECOME AN UNPOPULATED WASTELAND. ( LAUGHTER ) ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS IS GREAT NEWS FOR CONSUMERS, FOR THE ECONOMY, AND FOR OUR GIANT CARS.
S.U.V. SALES ARE HOT AGAIN THANKS TO THE GAS PRICES.
LOW GAS PRICES ARE HELPING SALES OVERALL, PARTICULARLY AMONG BIGGER MODELS LIKE S.U.V.s.
AMERICANS BACK TO BUYING S.U.V.s. SALES OF THE EIGHT-PASSENGER LINCOLN NAVIGATOR UP 88%.
Stephen:  YEAH, BABY! S.U.V. RS BACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE LINCOLN NAVIGATOR, THE  CHEVY SUBURBAN, THE CADILLAC REGRET. ( LAUGHTER ) COMMEMORATIVE BLACK RHINO EDITION. FOLKS, THAT IS AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM. WE SEIZE THE MOMENT. CARPE GASUM. I MEAN, FUEL IS CHEAP THIS WEEK. GIVE ME A FIVE-YEAR LEASE ON A ROLLING CARGO SHIP WITH THE AERODYNAMICS OF A CINDER BLOCK BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE ARE NOW LIVING IN A NONSTOP PETROLEUM PARTY THAT WILL NEVER, EVER END. THAT'S JUST HOW MARKETS WORK. HERE NOW TO TELL ME THAT'S NOT HOW MARKETS WORK IS THE DIRECTOR OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY, JASON BORDOFF. JASON, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). OKAY, ALL RIGHT. SO THIS IS IT, THIS IS IT. GAS PRICES HAVE COME DOWN. THIS IS THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IT'S-- IT'S-- IT'S-- IT'S OIL PARTY.
IT IS RIGHT RIGHT NOW.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, THEN IT ALWAYS WILL BE.
OIL PRICES HAVE A FUNNY WAY OF GOING UP AND GOING DOWN. THEY ALWAYS HAVE AND THEY ALWAYS WILL. THEY'RE LOW RIGHT NOW--
Stephen:  MAYBE THIS IS THE TIME THEY DON'T THOUGH.
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BET ON THAT. YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT BUYING A NEW CAR AND WILL HAVE IT 10, 15 YEARS, LIKE MOST PEOPLE, YOU'RE BETTER OFF INVESTING IN A FUEL-EFFICIENT CAR TO SAVE MORE MONEY DOWN THE ROAD
Stephen:  YEAH BUT THERE'S FUEL EFFICIENT AND THERE'S FUEL EFFICIENT. I CAN GET A FUEL EFFICENT SUV I CAN DRIVE ALL THE PRIUSES IN THE WORLD RIGHT OFF THE SANTA MONICA PIER RIGHT NOW, CAN'T I. WHATEVER HANDED TO PEAK OIL?  I HEARD WE HAD RUN OUT OF OIL IN THE WORLD, WE WOULDN'T FIND ANY. NOW IT'S LIKE OUR SUBSTRATE IS JUST A SLURRY OF HYDROCARBON HOT POCKETS.
THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE PEOPLE THINK WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF OIL, AND IT TURNS OUT PEOPLE CAN BE PRETTY INNOVATIVE, AND WHEN THE PRICE IS HIGH THEY DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW WAYS TO EXTRACT HYDROCARBONS FROM WANT GROUND.
Stephen:  HOW MUCH SURPLUS OIL DO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW?
WE DON'T HAVE SURPLUS. WE ARE STILL AN IMPORTER OF OIL AND WILL BE AN IMPORTER AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE.
Stephen:  HOW ABOUT THE WORLD? THERE HAS TO BE  A LOT OF OIL IN THE WORLD BECAUSE THE PRICE IS GOING DOWN
THERE IS OIL IN--
Stephen: DID I JUST TEACH YOU ECONOMICS? I THINK I JUST TAUGHT YOU ECONOMICS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THEY'RE SO DEPENDENT ON OIL, IS THERE A CHANCE THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE ELECTED MISS RUSSIA NEXT YEAR?
RUSSIA IS IN SEVERE ECONOMIC STRAITS. THEIR ECONOMY IS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE. THEIR CURRENCY, THE RUBLE, HAS FALLEN OFF A CLIFF IN THE LAST FEW DAYS.
Stephen:  ISN'T THIS A GREAT ARGUMENT-- THE ARGUMENT FOR HAVING CHEAP GAS IS THAT IT DESTROYS OUR ENEMIES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). BECAUSE IF WE HAVE CHEAP GAS, ISN'T IT-- WHAT I'M SAYING IS AREN'T THOSE OF US ON THE CONSERVATIVE PRO-FRACKING SIDE, AREN'T WE THE ONES WHO ARE RIGHT. WE HAVE CHEAP GAS, IT'S DESTROYING THE RUSSIANS, AND IT WEAKENS SOME QUESTIONABLE ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
INCREASING AMERICAN OIL PRODUCTION, RENIEWS CADUCEUSING OUR IMPORTS, CUTTURE MARKET SHARE FOR VENEZUELA, IRAN, RUSSIA-- THESE ARE COUNTRIES WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR. THAT'S WHY WE ARE SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA AND IRAN. AMERICA IS MORE ENERGY SECURE, BECAUSE WE INCREASED PRODUCTION AND REDUCED CONSUMPTION.
Stephen:  HOW BAD COULD THINGS GET FOR THE OPEC NATIONS. ARE THE SAUDIS GOING TO HAVE TO TIGHTEN THEIR BELT BELTS? AND A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION, COTHEY WEAR BELTS?
THE SAUDIS ARE BETTER OFF THAN OTHERS. THEY HAVE ABOUT $1 TRILLION IN RESERVE. COUNTRIES LIKE VENEZUELA, LIKE RUSSIA, LIKE IRAN, THAT NEED 130, $140, BARREL OF OIL JUST TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS ARE AT THE RISK OF DEFAULT AND REAL ECONOMIC CHAOS RIGHT NOW.
Stephen:  SO SORRY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. JASON BORDOFF. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
