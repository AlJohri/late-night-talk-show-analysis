WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,  THANKS SO MUCH. NATION, I WANT YOU TO KNOW  THAT IT GIVES ME NO PLEASURE  TO SAY THIS BUT BARACK OBAMA IS A FAILED PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN THE SCANDALS JUST  KEEP COMING, FOLKS. FOR INSTANCE THIS WEEK THE  ILS SCANDAL WAS EMBROILED IN  ITS OWN SCANDAL SAUCE.
A NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVES  COMING FORWARD, FAIRLY DEEP  POCKET DONORS WHO ARE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT, I WAS AUDITED  OVER THE LAST YEAR, GOING  INTO THE ELECTION.
DID THE IRS TARGET  CONSERVATIVE DONORS DURING  LAST YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTION? FRANK VANDERSLOOT, AN IDAHO  BUSINESSMAN SAYS HE HAD A  BULLS EYE ON HIS BACK.
LOOK WHAT THEY DID TO  VANDERSLOOT.
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR  WHAT THE IRS DID TO FRANK  VANDERSLOOT. THAT KIND OF UNFAIR  TARGETING COULD BESMIRCH THE  GOOD NAME OF VANDERSLOOT. AND FOLKS, VANDERSLOOT'S NOT  ALONE. SAM ZHERKA, THE OWNER OF NEW  YORK'S CHEETAHS STRIP CLUB  HAS FILED A 20 MILLION  DOLLAR LAWSUIT CLAIMING HE'S BEING TARGETED BY THE IRS  FOR HIS POLITICAL  ACTIVITIES. IT HAS GOT TO BE POLITICAL  TARGETING, FOLKS. I MEAN THERE IS NO OTHER  REASON FOR THE IRS TO  SUSPECT A BUSINESS IN WHICH  GREASEY SINGLES ARE TOUCHING THE BUTT CRACKS OF WOMEN WHO  HAVE ALL CHOSEN FAKE STAGE  NAMES FROM A SPICE RACK. (LAUGHTER)  NOW OF COURSE I HEAR WHAT  YOU ARE THINKING. YOU ARE THINKING STEPHEN,  PEOPLE GET AUDITED ALL THE  TIME. THIS IS JUST COINCIDENCE AND  PARANOIA. OH REALLY? IF I'M PARANOID, WHY CAN I  HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS? YEAH, THINK ABOUT IT. AND THIS SCANDAL, THIS  SCANDAL ISN'T JUST ABOUT HOW  THE IRS TAKES OUR MONEY. IT'S ABOUT HOW THEY WASTE IT  TOO. AND EXPLOSIVE NEW REPORT HAS  REVELED THAT OVER THE PAST  THREE YEARS THE IRS SPENT $50 MILLION ON 220 EMPLOYEE  CONFERENCES, 50 MILLION. THEY ONLY WORK ONE DAY A  YEAR. (LAUGHTER)  NOW IT TURNS OUT, TURNS OUT  THEY SPENT THE OTHER 364  PARTYING LIKE IT'S 1099. (LAUGHTER)  JIM.
WE'RE LEARNING SOME  DISTURBING NEW DETAILS  CONCERNING THE IRS,  SPECIFICALLY THIS VIDEO JUST TURNED OVER TO CONGRESSIONAL  INVESTIGATORS THAT SHOWS IRS  EMPLOYEES BLIND DANCING. IT -- PRODUCED ON THE  TAXPAYER DIME FOR A TRAINING  CONFERENCE THAT TOOK PLACE  BACK IN 2010.
Stephen: YES, THE IRS IS  WASTING YOUR HARD EARNED TAX  DOLLARS ON DANCE LESSONS FOR PEOPLE WITH THE RHYTHM OF  UNEVENLY LOADED WASHING  MACHINES. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN COME ON! IS THERE NOT, ARE THERE NO  BETTER WAYS R THERE NO  BETTER WAYS TO SPEND THAT  CASH? LIKE PERHAPS PAYING FOR THIS  GUY A VERT IGGO MEDICATION? -- VERTIGO MEDICATION. I DEMAND, NATION, I DEMAND  AN INVESTIGATION. WHAT KIND OF LINE DANCING  WAS THAT? WAS THIS THE ELECTRIC FLY,  IF SO, IT WAS POWERED BY  SOLYNDRA OR WAS IT COTTON  EYED JOE. I HOPE NOT BECAUSE HE ALWAYS  TAKES THE FIFTH. NOBODY KNOWS WHERE HE COMES  FROM OR WHERE DOES HE GO. WHERE DO YOU COME FROM,  COTTON EYED JOE! AND AND LONG LAST IF THEY  HAVE TO DANCE, THEY SHOULD  AT LEAST GET SOME WORK DONE AT THE SAME TIME. THEY COULD REVIEW SOME TAX  FORMS. IT'S EASY. WATCH THIS, JIMMY, PLEASE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ODE DIVIDENDS, FAXABLE  PENSIONS AND ANNUITY, ADD  LINE 44 AND 45, RESIDENTIAL ENERGY CREDITS, AN FLY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
