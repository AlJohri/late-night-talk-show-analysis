A RECORD LEVEL, IN-HOUSE  CREATIVE SERVICES AGENCY, BOOK  MUST BISHING DIVISION NOW YOU ARE THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND  CORRESPONDENT FOR ADVICE HBO'S  NEW NEWS MAGAZINE. DESCRIBE THE BRAND. WHAT IS IT OTHER THAN, YOU KNOW,  DIFFERENT? [LAUGHTER]
WE STARTED AS A MAGAZINE  ABOUT 18 YEARS AGO.
BOOK WHEN THERE WERE  MAGAZINES NL AND WE MOVED TO 34  COUNTRIES AND AS WE TRAVELED TO THOSE COUNTRIES WE NOTICED THERE  WAS A LOT OF CRAZY STUFF GOING  ON. WE STARTED REPORTING AND  SHOOTING IT AND, YOU KNOW, PUT  IT ONLINE AND NOW WE HAVE A BIG YOUTH FOLLOWING.
WHAT I LOOK ABOUT IT IS YOU  HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS HAVING A  CASUAL MISS SOJ ANY. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE  EXPLORING A SORT OF RECONTEXT  YOU'LLIZATION OF A PATRIARCHAL MASCULINITY OR DO YOU SORT OF  LIKE CITY SHOTS? THERE SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NICE  STUFF IN HERE, YOU KNOW? NAKED LADIES AND LIKE ARMED  GORILLAS.
SURE.
Stephen: WHY THE MIX?
YOU KNOW, LOOK FASHION IS,  YOU KNOW, WE HAVE NAKED GUYS IN  THERE.
Stephen: THERE'S NOT A LOT  OF FASHION INVOLVED IN LIKE NO  CLOTHES ON. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT THE HONEY TO GET PEOPLE  TO THE REST OF THE STORY.
THE EDITORS OF THE MAG ARE  UNDER 40.

SURE.
Stephen: IF YOU ARE WE'RE  OTHER PLACES, I WOULD RATHER IT  BE YOU NOT ME.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP OF  SOME PLACE YOU JUST WENT.
I THINK WE'RE IN THE  NORTHWEST PROVINCE ON THE  AFGHANI BORDER WITH THE PAKISTANI ARMY GOING INTO  TALIBAN CONTROLLED AREAS.
Stephen: JIM., LET'S TAKE A  LOOK. LEAVING NOW. THE ONLY PART OF THE WHOLE AREA  THE PAKISTANI ARMY CONTROLS AND  SUPPORTS JUST TO BE CLEAR WHEN WE SAY THEY ONLY CONTROL THE  PORT THAT MEANS THE RECEIVE OF  THE PROVINCE IS CONTROLLED BY THE TALIBAN.
THERE'S MACHINE GUN AS LONG  EVERY BUILDING ON THE ROUTE. IT MAKES ME WORRIED THAT THEY  SAY THAT EVERYTHING IS UNDER  CONTROL.
Stephen: WILL YOU SHARE?
WHUR ACTUALLY DOING IT.
Stephen: WHERE YOU SCARED?
WHEN YOU ARE DOING IT YOU ARE  WORRIED ABOUT THE SHOT. AT THE TIME YOU ARE NOT SCARED  WHEN YOU GO BACK AND ETDITY YOU  ARE LIKE WHAT WAS I DOING.
Stephen: DO YOU CALL  YOURSELF A JOURNALIST OR YOU ARE  AN ADD VENTURER WITH A CAMERA  ARE?
I'M BOTH.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU CALL  YOURSELF?
I DON'T CALL MYSELF ANYTHING. WE GET STORIES.
Stephen: ARE THEY ACCURATE?
OF COURSE.
Stephen: WHY? WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE ACCURATE  WHY CAN'T THEY JUST BE  EMOTIONALLY MOVING.
WE HAVE TO BE ACCURATE.
Stephen: WHY? I WATCH HBO ARE YOU TELLING ME  THERE ARE REAL DRAGONS OUT  THERE? [LAUGHTER] YOU SENT OVER VIES WAS THE  OUTFIT THAT MADE NEWS BY SENDING  DENNIS RODMAN AND THE GLOBE TROTTERS TO NORTH KOREA. SINCE THEY'VE COME BACK NORTH  KOREA HAS BEGUN ON A WAR FOOTING  AND WARNED THE WORLD ABOUT NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST. THANK YOU -- HOLOCAUST. THANK YOU FOR THAT. HAVE YOU BEEN THERE YOURSELF?
I WENT TWICE.
Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN  THERE WITH DENNIS?
NO, I'M NOT ALLOWED TO GO  BACK BECAUSE I WAS HARSH ON THE  REGIME. WHEN I WAS THERE I SAW THE MAGIC  BASKETBALL.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT.
THAT MADELEINE ALBRIGHT GAVE  TO KIM JONG-IL THAT IS SIGNED BY  MICHAEL JORDAN. THAT'S WHY THEY LOVE THE BULLS,  THE CHICAGO BULLS, MICHAEL  JORDAN ERA.
Stephen: I LOVE THE CHICAGO  BULLS, TOO. IS THERE ANY CHANCE I'M A  TOTALITARIAN LEADER.
WE FIGURED THEY LOVED THE  BULLS, WE COULD SEND THEM OVER  AND MAYBE HE WOULD SHOW UP. DID HE AND HE INVITED EVERYBODY  BACK TO DINNER.
Stephen: YOU'VE BEEN THERE,  WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE LIKE? IS IT CAN BE STAY AT PEACE ARE  ARE WE GOING TO WAR?
MY GUESS WOULD BE PEACE. THEY DO A LOT OF SAB BE RAYING  TO GET WHAT THEY WANT WHICH IS  FOOD, ENERGY. THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST. IT'S LIKE GOING BACK TO STALIN  IN RUSH SHAH OR MAOIST CHINA. THEY ARE A FULLY UTOPIAN  COMMUNIST STATE THAT IS AT WAR  WITH US IDEOLOGICALLY.
Stephen: YOU GO TO PLACES  LIKE FORCED LABOR CAMPS.
