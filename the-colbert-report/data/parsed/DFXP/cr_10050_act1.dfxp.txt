A FAREWELL TO ARMS BY ERNEST HEMINGWAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
Audience: STEPHEN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. IN HERE, OUT THERE, JOINING ME FOR THE ANHISTORIC THIRD EDITION OF THE COLBERT BOOK CLUB. I STARTED AS A TRIBUTE TO AND COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT UPON MY DEAR FRIEND OPRAH WINFREY. AS EVERYONE KNOWS OPRAH GIVES ME THINGS, WHETHER IT'S SWEATERS, AVOCADOS, OR CEASE AND DESIST LETTERS. PREVIOUS INSTALLMENTS OF THE COLBERT BOOK CLUB INCLUDE "THE GREAT GATSBY" AND ANYTHING BUT "CATCHER AND THE RYE." THEY'RE WONDERFUL SHOWS FILLED WITH THOUGHTFUL LITERARY ANALYSIS. NONE OF WHICH I CAN REMEMBER BECAUSE I WAS [BEEP] ON CHARDONNAY. TONIGHT, TONIGHT IS A SPECIAL NIGHT. A NIGHT THAT IS COLD, AND DARK, AND HARD, AND FILLED WITH REGRET. A NIGHT THAT WE DISCUSS A WRITER NAMED ERNEST HEMINGWAY. NOW SIT DOWN, AND BE QUIET. TO CELEBRATE THIS AMERICAN ICON I'M WEARING A RUGGED SAFARI OUTFIT AND OCCASIONALLY DRINKING FROM A GOAT BLADDER WINESKIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: MMMM. THAT IS SOME GOOD BLADDER. AND OF COURSE I'M SURROUNDED BY DEAD ANIMALS. A WILD BORE, ELEPHANT TUSKS, A BEARSKIN RUG, A MARLIN, AND AN AUTHENTIC LEOPARD THROW FROM DEEPEST DARKEST POTTERY BARN. MY BIGGEST TROPHY TONIGHT IS THE RHINO. THEY'RE ENDANGERED SO I ONLY KILLED THE FRONT HALF. I LET THE BACK HALF GO TO REPRODUCE. PERHAPS THE MOST MAG NIFF SENT TROPHY ON THE WALL IS ME. THERE I AM AS PAPA AS I MAY LOOK LATER IN LIFE, AT THE AGE OF TWO YEARS AGO. MY SHOW IS KILLING ME. HEMINGWAY WAS A MASTER OF PROSE. FAMOUS FOR HIS SHORT UNADORNED SENTENCES. A STYLE EMULATED BY MANY AND PERFECTED BY A FEW LIKE THE INCREDIBLE HULK. HULK SMASH, CLASSIC HEMINGWAY. HEMINGWAY HAS SO MANY GREAT NOVELS I'M WILLING TO TELL PEOPLE I HAVE READ THE OLD MAN IN THE SEA TO WHOM THE BELL TOLLS ABOUT A MAN WAITING FOR A SIGNAL THAT HIS MICROWAVE BURRITO IS DONE. TRAGICALLY THE INSIDE IS STILL COLD. TONIGHT I WILL SIT DOWN WITH AUTHOR MICHAEL CHABON TO DISCUSS AU"A FAREWELL TO ARMS" AN EPICSS TALE OF LOVE, WAR, LOYALTY AND DEATH. IT'S THE "HUNGER GAMES" WITH MUSTARD GAS. FIRST LET'S GET TO KNOW THE MAN BEHIND THE MARLIN CARCASS. IN PART ONE BETTER KNOW A HEMINGWAY. ERNEST HEMINGWAY. HE WAS BORN IN OAK PARK, ILLINOIS IN 1899. HE HAD A UNUSUAL BOYHOOD. IN THAT IT WAS PART GIRLHOOD. FOR THE FIRST SIX YEARS OF HIS LIFE HIS MOTHER DRESSED HIM AS A GIRL CALLING HIM ERNESTENE WHICH HE IN NO WAY SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE COMPENSATING FOR. AT 18 HE VOLUNTEERED FOR WORLD WAR I AS A AMBULANCE DRIVER ON THE ITALIAN FRONT WHERE HE WAS WOUNDED BY MORTAR FIRE BUT HE STILL CARRIED A SOLDIER TO HSAFETY, FOR WHICH HE RECEIVED THE ITALIAN MEDAL OF BRAVERY AND UNLIMITED BREADSTICKS.  AFTER THE WAR HEMINGWAY JOINED A GROUP OF EX PATRIOTS IN PARIS INCLUDING F SCOTT FITZGERALD, JAMES JOYCE AND OWEN WILSON. IN 1926 HE PUBLISHED HIS FIRST NOVEL "THE SUN ALSO RISES" BASED ON RUNNING WITH THE BULLS. IT'S CONSIDERED HIS GREATEST WORK. SOME HOW HE MANAGED TO TYPE IT WHILE FLEEING BULLS. THREE YEARS LATER HE FINISHED TONIGHT'S BOOK "A FAREWELL TO ARMS." IT ADDRESSES THE QUESTION, IF YOU SAY FAREWELL TO YOUR ARMS, WHAT DO YOU WAVE TO SAY GOODBYE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU KNOW THE NICE THING ABOUT SANGRIA IS YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU THROW IT UP. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THAT'S CALLED FORESHADOWING. [LAUGHING]
Stephen: WHEN WORLD WAR II BEGAN HEMINGWAY RETURNED AS A JOURNALIST. HE WAS BUSY LANDING A MARLIN AT SEA AND NEVER GOT OFF THE VESSEL. HE WAS A LEGENDARY SPORTS MAN AND HUNTER. HIS BIG GAME TROPHIES INCLUDE A RHINO, A LION AND A LEOPARD. THESE WERE THE BASIS FOR HIS BOOK "I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL BARBAR." THE YEARS OF HARD LIVING TOOK THEIR TOLL ON PAPA. HE DIED FROM A SELF INFLICTED GUN SHOT WOUND. SADLY THE KILLER WAS NEVER FOUND. 52 YEARS LATER ERNEST HEMINGWAY'S WORKS ARE CHERISHED BY READERS, WRITERS AND ANYONE WHO HATES ADJECTIVES. WHEN WE RETURN I WILL BE JOINED BY ANOTHER PULITZER PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR, MICHAEL  CHABON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
