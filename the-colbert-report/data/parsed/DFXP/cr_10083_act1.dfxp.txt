STEPHEN COLBERT IS FACING SERIOUS BACKLASH THIS MORNING AFTER A TWEET SENT BY THE SHOW FROM THE @COLBERTREPORT ACCOUNT.
PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR THE STEPHEN COLBERT SHOW TO BE CANCELED... CANCELED! (AUDIENCE SIGHS) (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
AHHH! DON'T WORRY, STEPHEN. YOU WERE JUST HAVING A NIGHT MARE.
Stephen: WHAT'S HAPPENING? RECENT STRESSFUL EVENTS IN YOUR LIFE  CAUSED AN EMOTIONAL IMPLOSION, COMBINED WITH YOUR NARCISSISTIC PERSECUTION COMPLEX MANIFESTED THEMSELVES IN LOSS AND DESTRUCTION.
Stephen: I KNOW THAT STUFF. WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?
YOU'RE STILL DREAMING, STEPHEN.
Stephen: AND I'M DREAMING ABOUT B.D. WONG BECAUSE --
YOU FELL ASLEEP WATCHING LAW AND ORDER, SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.
Stephen: THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.
MY PLEASURE, STEPHEN. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SO... COULD YOU LEAVE?
I CAN'T LEAVE UNTIL YOU WAKE UP.
Stephen: OH. AND B.D. WONG HAS SOME SHIT TO DO.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, OF COURSE. SURE. BYE! THIS IS STILL THE COLBERT REPORT!
HI.     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. (AUDIENCE CHANTING)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS, I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THIS -- FOLKS, I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THIS, BUT WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING TO THIS COUNTRY? EVERYDAY, WE LOSE A LITTLE BIT MORE. THIS MORNING, I LOOKED AT THE SOLE OF MY SHOE AND IT SAID: "MADE IN VIETNAM." (LAUGHTER) C'MON, THIS IS AMERICA. IT SHOULD SAY "MADE IN CHINA"!! (LAUGHTER) WELL, NOW, THE FORCES OF CULTURAL CORROSION ARE TARGETING THE PRECIOUS LITTLE MIRACLES WE HOLD MOST DEAR. OUR PHONES. (LAUGHTER) JIM?
YOU KNOW THE SMILEY FACE ICONS CALLED EMOGI ALL OVER YOUR TEXT AND TWEETS? APPLE IS SAYING THEY'RE NOT DIVERSE ENOUGH. THEY'RE WORKING WITH UNICODE CONSORTIUM TO COME UP WITH NEW ONES!
Stephen: UGH! THIS MAKES ME SO ANGRYFACE THAT I COULD PUNCH A SNOWMAN INTO A CIRCUS TENT FULL OF SEXY STILETTOS. AFTER THAT, I'LL HAVE TO COOL DOWN WITH A HANDFUL OF PILLS AND A TURKEY DRUMSTICK. (LAUGHTER) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE DIVERSITY MAFIA IS WHINING THAT THE EMOJI CHARACTERS ARE PREDOMINANTLY WHITE. OF COURSE THEY ARE! WHITE MALE IS AMERICAN NEUTRAL. IT'S THE BASELINE MODEL. IF YOU WANT TO ACCESSORIZE, YOU'RE FREE TO ADD BELLS AND WHISTLES LIKE "MELANIN" OR "VAGINA." BUT NOW, THE PC POLICE ARE GONNA SHOVE NEW ETHNIC EMOTIONS INTO OUR PHONES. I CAN'T JUST BE SAD ANYMORE. I'LL HAVE TO BE "BLACK" SAD. (LAUGHTER) I'M SORRY. THAT'S WAY SADDER THAN I'M WILLING TO BE! BESIDES, THERE'S ALREADY PLENTY OF DIVERSITY ON THE EMOJI KEYBOARD. LIKE TURBAN GUY. (LAUGHTER) HE COULD REPRESENT ANYTHING. A HINDU, A MUSLIM, A GENIE, OR HEAD TRAUMA VICTIM OF ANY RACE. (LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, INTERNET EQUALITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER, AS I LEARNED THIS WEEKEND WHEN THE INTERWEBS TRIED TO SWALLOW ME WHOLE. BUT I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT I GOT LODGED IN ITS THROAT AND IT HACKED ME BACK UP LIKE A HASTILY CHEWED CHICKEN WING. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS WHO'S ATTACKING ME NOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME ON THE INTERNET, WE TURN TO THE TV.
PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR THE STEPHEN COLBERT SHOW TO BE CANCELED AFTER A TWEET ABOUT ASIANS APPEARED ON THE COMEDY CENTRAL TWITTER ACCOUNT.
#CANCELCOLBERT IS TRENDING THIS MORNING.
#CANCELCOLBERT  IS TRENDING THIS MORNING.
#CANCELCOLBERT  WENT VIRAL.
Stephen: BUT FOLKS, I'M STILL HERE! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU PEOPLE! THE DARK FORCES TRYING TO SILENCE MY MESSAGE OF CORE CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES MIXED WITH YOUTH-FRIENDLY PRODUCT PLACEMENT HAVE BEEN THWARTED. (LAUGHTER) WENT THROUGH A FEW OF THESE THIS WEEKEND. BUT FOLKS, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE -- IT WAS CLOSE. WE ALMOST LOST ME. (LAUGHTER) I'M NEVER GOING TO TAKE ME FOR GRANTED EVER AGAIN. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. LAST WEDNESDAY, I SALUTED WASHINGTON REDSKINS OWNER DANIEL SNYDER FOR HIS NEW CHARITY, THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS ORIGINAL AMERICANS FOUNDATION. WHICH SOME HAVE CALLED AN OBVIOUS ATTEMPT TO WIN OVER NATIVE AMERICANS BECAUSE IT ONLY USES THE TERM "REDSKINS" ONCE IN ITS NAME. (LAUGHTER) NOW, I HAVE MY OWN RACIAL MISUNDERSTANDING WITH THE ASIAN COMMUNITY OVER A LONG-RUNNING AND BELOVED CHARACTER ON MY SHOW. VERY IMPORTANT. HE IS A CHARACTER. HE IS NOT ME. THIS IS THE REAL STEPHEN COLBERT. I MEAN EVERYTHING I SAY ON THIS SHOW. HE MEANS... WELL, YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIM. AND HE'S NOT RETURNING MY CALLS. ANYWAY, I WAS SO INSPIRED BY DAN SNYDER'S CHARITABLE OUTREACH THAT I FORMED MY OWN CHARITY. "THE CHING CHONG DING DONG FOUNDATION FOR SENSITIVITY TO ORIENTALS OR WHATEVER." (LAUGHTER) THAT WAS WEDNESDAY. IT RERAN FOUR TIMES ON THURSDAY, WAS POSTED ON THE SHOW'S Facebook PAGE. NOT A PEEP OUT OF THE INTERNET. THEN AROUND 7:00 ON THURSDAY, MY NETWORK'S PROMOTIONAL TWITTER ACCOUNT, @COLBERTREPORT, TWEETED THE NAME OF MY FOUNDATION WITHOUT PROVIDING A VIDEO LINK TO THE ORIGINAL SEGMENT OR MENTIONING THAT I WAS INSPIRED BY THE REDSKINS CHARITY. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION LIMITED TO 140 CHARACTERS WOULD EVER CREATE MISUNDERSTANDINGS? (LAUGHTER) BUT I HAVE NEVER ONCE USED @COLBERTREPORT. AS YOU HEROES KNOW, I'M @STEPHENATHOME. THOUGH FULL DISCLOSURE, I SOMETIMES TWEET FROM @STEPHENATHOME AT WORK IN THE BATHROOM. THEN, WHEN THE TWIT HIT THE FAN, THE BRAIN TRUST AT MY NETWORK TOOK THE TWEET DOWN, BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THIS INTERNET WORKS. YOU CAN JUST TAKE STUFF DOWN AND NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW IT HAPPENED. JUST ASK MAYOR WIENER. (LAUGHTER) NOW, I'M NOT TRYING TO THROW ANYONE UNDER THE BUS HERE. MOSTLY BECAUSE I DON'T GO THAT CLOSE TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. BUT WHEN I SAW THE TWEET WITH NO CONTEXT, I UNDERSTOOD HOW PEOPLE WERE OFFENDED. SAME WAY I, AS AN IRISH-AMERICAN, WAS OFFENDED AFTER READING ONLY ONE LINE OF JONATHAN SWIFT'S "A MODEST PROPOSAL." I MEAN, EAT IRISH BABIES?! HASHTAG CANCEL SWIFT! TREND IT! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) NOW, ALL OF THIS WAS STARTED BY A HASHTAG ACTIVIST, OR A HASHTIVIST, WHO HAS BEEN VICIOUSLY ATTACKED ON TWITTER. IF ANYONE IS DOING THAT FOR ME, I WANT YOU TO STOP RIGHT NOW. SHE'S JUST SPEAKING HER MIND. THAT'S WHAT TWITTER'S FOR, AS WELL AS RUNNING THE ENDING OF EVERY SHOW I HAVEN'T WATCHED YET. NOW, THE CANCEL COLBERT PEOPLE THINK THAT EVEN IN CONTEXT, I'M A RACIST. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M NOT A RACIST. I DON'T EVEN SEE RACE. NOT EVEN MY OWN. PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE, AND I BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I JUST DEVOTED SIX MINUTES TO EXPLAINING HOW I'M NOT A RACIST. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) AND THAT'S ABOUT THE WHITEST THING YOU CAN DO. NOW, ONCE THE CANCEL COLBERT HASHTAG GOT ROLLING, IT WAS ONE TO HAVE THE TOP FIVE TRENDS FOR MORE THAN 36 HOURS BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE KING. (LAUGHTER) THEN IT WAS PICKED UP BY A SMALL GROUP OF AMERICANS WHO GET THEIR INFORMATION "ONLY" FROM TWITTER -- THE NEWS MEDIA. THERE WERE ONLINE STORIES IN THE "U.S.A. TODAY," THE "NEW YORKER," "VARIETY," "SLATE," THE "HUFFINGTON POST," THREE FEATURES ON "TIME DOT-COM" AND SEVEN ON "SALON." CNN EVEN TOOK A BREAK FROM THEIR MALAYSIAN AIRLINER COVERAGE TO REPORT SPOTTING WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS THE WRECKAGE OF MY SHOW OFF THE COAST OF AUSTRALIA. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) BUT MAYBE MOST HURTFUL, MY FELLOW CONSERVATIVES ABANDONED ME IN MY TIME OF NEED. LIKE MICHELLE MALKIN, WHO "CO-SIGNED" ON TO CANCEL-COLBERT AND CALLED ME A "COWARD." THIS CUTS DEEP, ESPECIALLY SINCE I LEARNED EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT SENSITIVITY TO THE ASIAN-AMERICAN EXPERIENCE FROM MICHELLE'S 2004 BOOK, "IN DEFENSE OF INTERNMENT." (AUDIENCE BOOING) TURNS OUT THEY HAD IT COMING. (LAUGHTER) ONE LESS THING TO FEEL GUILTY ABOUT. SO TO RECAP -- A WEB EDITOR I'VE NEVER MET POSTS A TWEET IN MY NAME ON AN ACCOUNT I DON'T CONTROL, OUTRAGES A HASHTAG ACTIVIST, AND NEWS MEDIA GETS 72 HOURS OF CONTENT. THE SYSTEM WORKED! (LAUGHTER) BUT THIS ALL STARTED RIGHT AFTER I TAPED THURSDAY NIGHT'S SHOW, SO I COULDN'T RESPOND UNTIL TODAY. IN A SENSE, I "WAS" CANCELED... FOR THREE DAYS. JUST LIKE JESUS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) BUT I'M BACK, AND NATION, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE... FOR CARING ENOUGH TO TRY AND BRIDGE A CULTURAL DIVIDE WITH MY FOUNDATION. I THOUGHT WE WERE READY. IF I HAVE A FAULT, IT'S THAT I BELIEVED IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TOO MUCH. WAS I WRONG TO DO THAT? (AUDIENCE ANSWERS "NO! ") I WISH I COULD BELIEVE THAT, BUT THEY HAVE CALLED FOR CANCELING COLBERT, AND I'M WILLING TO MEET THEM HALFWAY. EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY -- AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS -- I AM SHUTTING DOWN THE WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS OF THE CHING CHONG DING DONG FOUNDATION FOR SENSITIVITY TO ORIENTALS OR WHATEVER. (LAUGHTER) NO, NO -- I HAVE TO! I CAN TELL HOW SAD YOU ARE ABOUT IT (AUDIENCE SAYS, OH! ] THE SADDEST PART IS, BECAUSE OF ALL THE ATTENTION, WE RAISED A LOT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND. MONEY THAT WILL NOW BE DONATED TO DAN SNYDER'S WASHINGTON REDSKINS ORIGINAL AMERICANS FOUNDATION, WHICH CLEARLY DOES NOT OFFEND THE INTERNET, 'CUZ  I HAVEN'T SEEN SHIT ABOUT THAT. NOW, TO FIRE THE ENTIRE FOUNDATION STAFF. JA-MES, GET OUT HERE. JA-MES, EVERYBODY. I HAVE TERRIBLE NEWS, JA-MES.
IT'S JAMES. (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: JA-MES, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LET YOU GO AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE FOUNDATION. CALL SIR PAUL AND MILEY AND TELL THEM THE CONCERT'S OFF. THEN CLEAR OUT YOUR DESK.
BUT I'M THE ONLY ASIAN PERSON YOU KNOW.
Stephen: I'M SORRY, JA-MES. I HAVE NO CHOICE. BUT I WILL LET YOU RETURN TO THE SHOW FOR NO PAY AS PART OF THE MICHELLE MALKIN MEMORIAL UNPAID INTERNMENT PROGRAM. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) JA-MES, EVERYBODY!
UM... THANK YOU?
Stephen: WELL, THAT ENDS THAT CONTROVERSY. I JUST PRAY THAT NO ONE EVER TWEETS ABOUT THE TIME I SAID ROSA PARKS WAS OVERRATED, HITLER HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS, OR RAN A CARTOON DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH SHOWING PRESIDENT OBAMA TEAMING UP WITH THE KU KLUX KLAN. 'CAUSE, MAN, THAT SOUNDS PRETTY BAD OUT OF CONTEXT. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE FOUNDER OF TWITTER, BIZ STONE.
