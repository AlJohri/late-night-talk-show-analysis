Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT THINKS THAT AMERICANS CAN BETTER HONOR OUR TROOPS. SO TWO MAGNETIC YELLOW RIBBONS? PLEASE WELCOME DAVID FRININGEL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY, DAVID, NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK. NOW GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, YOU WERE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE GOOD SOLDIERS.
RIGHT.
YOUR BOOK ABOUT BEING EMBEDDED WITH WHICH GROUP IN IRAQ.
IT WAS INFRANT LEE BATTALION DURING THE PERIOD OF THE SURGE. THESE GUYS WENT OVER, WELL, IT WAS CONSIDERED THE LOST MOMENT OF THE WAR. THEY WERE THERE FOR 15 MONTHS. THEY GOT PRETTY BANGED UP. AND I WROTE THAT BOOK. THEN THEY CAME HOME. AND THEY ARE BANGED UP IN DIFFERENT WAYS SO I HAVE WRITTEN A SECRETARY BOOK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING AT HOME.
Stephen: AN IT'S CALLED THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW THIS IS ABOUT THE WOUNDS THAT WE-- WE CAN'T NECESSARILY SEE RZ AND THEY CAN'T SEE THEM EITHER WHICH CAUSES GREAT DOUBTS TO SOME OF THEM. SO THE BOOK, THE BOOK IS REALLY AN END MAT LOOK, IT'S NOT A POLICY BOCK BUT AN INTIMATE LOOK AT WHAT THE AFTERWAR IS. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COME HOME MENTALLY WOUNDED AND TRY TO RECOVER FROM WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.
Stephen: IS THIS SORT OF TRAUMA THAT WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT WITH VETERANS OF IRAQ AND AFGHAN TAN, IS THIS NEW OR WAS THIS HAPPENING IN WORLD WAR II AND THE KOREAN WAR AS WELL.
WELL, SURE. I MEAN THERE ARE NO HEADLINES IN THIS BOOK. IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T KNOW THAT WAR DOES THINGS TO PEOPLEMENT BUT THESE ARE OUR WARS, OUR CURRENT WARS, IT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE, WELL, MORE THAN 10 YEARS AND --
BUT IF WORLD WAR II THOSE GUYS WHO CAME BACK, DIDN'T THEY HAVE A WAY OF DEALING WITH T THEY WOULD JUST BOTTLE IT UP AND STUFF IT DOWN AND THEY WOULD JUST COME OUT AND SOMEONE BIG EXPLOSION OF RAGE IN 1967 OVER THANKSGIVING DINNER? THAT WAS THE OL WAY TO DO IT, THAT WAS THE 50sEE WAY, THE IKE WAY TO DO IT, NEVER TALK ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS.
YOU WILL BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT STILL GOES ON FROM THESE WARS AS WELL. THERE IS ONE PART OF THE BOOK, IT IS A THERAPY-- A SESSION IN COLORADO, ABOUT 20 GUYS IN THERE. AND THE INTERESTING PART OF THAT ISN'T WHAT THEY ARE RECOUNTING, IT'S PRETTY HORRIBLE WHAT THEY'VE DONE AND WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH, BUT THE FACT THAT THEY ALL SAY WHAT WAS I THINKING. WHAT WAS I THINKING WHEN I WAS DOING THAT KIND OF THING. AND SO-- .
Stephen: WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WAR, WHAT THEY WERE THINKING.
YES, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING THAT WOULD CAUSE THEM TO ACT THE WAY THEY DID IN THE WARTIME IT MADE PERFECT SENSE DURING THE WAR. BUT NOW THEY'RE BACK HOME AND THEY'RE CONSIDERING WHO THEY BECAME IN WARTIME AND THINKING WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THAT ABOUT.
Stephen: WELL, WHAT CAN THE AVERAGE PERSON, THE PERSON WHO, YOU KNOW W WHO IS JUST APPROACHING YOUR BOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME, PERHAPS HASN'T READ THE GOOD SOLDERS, ABOUT WHAT THESE GUYS WANT THROUGH IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, WHAT CAN THEY DO TO HELP SOLDIERS.
WELL WA, DO YOU THINK?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW, I'M ASKING YOU, HONEST TO GODDING I WOULD TO THE YOU HAVE ON IF I KNEW.
WELL, MAYBE A STARTING POINT IS TO PAY HONEST ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON. IRAQ MAY BE OVER AND AFGHANISTAN MAY BE WINDING DOWN BUT IT'S HEAR, IT'S GOING ON AND I THINK ACTUAL HONEST ATTENTION FROM PEOPLE WOULD BE A GOOD STARTING POINT.
Stephen: HONEST ATTENTION, I NEED TO YOU HELP ME OUT HERE. DO YOU MEAN LIKE LITERALLY DOW SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I MEAN HOW DO YOU START A CONVERSATION WITH ANYBODY. THESE-- .
Stephen: I GENERALLY DON'T, I GENERALLY DON'T. I'M A FAMOUS PERSON, THEY COME TALK TO ME. (LAUGHTER)
HOW WOULD THEY START A CONVERSATION WITH YOU.
Stephen: YOU'RE THAT DUDE! (LAUGHTER)
PRETTY GOOD WAY TO START.
Stephen: YOU'RE STEVE CAR REL. -- CARELL. MR. FINKLE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THE BOOK IS THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
