[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANKS. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW,  YOU KNOW I LOVE THE.
[ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU ASK ME, IT'S THE GREATEST  PLANET IN THE WHOLE WORLD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE EARTH IS FILLED WITH  VALUABLE TREASURE FROM OIL, TO  COAL, TO THOSE WEIRD LUMPY THINGS THEY MAKE POTATO CHIPS  OUT OF. [LAUGHTER] STILL, I'VE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF  EARTH DAY AND IT'S HIPPIE DIPPY  KUMBAYA ORGY OF  DRUM-CIRCLE-JERKS. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S WHY I'M SO HAPPY THE UTAH  DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES  IS CELEBRATING EARTH DAY BY SPONSORING A POSTER CONTEST FOR  KIDS. THE THEME: "WHERE WOULD WE BE  WITHOUT OIL, GAS & MINING?" [LAUGHTER] IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. IT'S THE SAME WAY WE CELEBRATE  PRESIDENT'S DAY BY HAVING KIDS  DRESS UP LIKE JOHN WILKES BOOTH! [LAUGHTER] AND THE CONTEST JUDGES ARE BOUND  TO KNOW THEIR STUFF, BECAUSE  IT'S CO-SPONSORED BY THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS. CHILDREN ARE A PRECIOUS  RESOURCE, AND IF ANYONE KNOWS  HOW TO EXPLOIT A RESOURCE, IT'S A PETROLEUM ENGINEER. [LAUGHTER] NOW, SOME LESS-ADVANCED STUDENTS  MAY NOT SEE THE CONNECTION  BETWEEN EARTH DAY AND THE USE OF NON-RENEWABLE PETROCHEMICALS. SO THE CONTEST GUIDE OFFERS A  FEW HELPFUL EXAMPLES, SUCH AS  "WE USE MINED MATERIALS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS EVERY DAY --  GASOLINE, CARS, COMPUTERS, AND  SKATEBOARDS." [LAUGHTER] YES, WHERE WOULD WE BE WITHOUT  AMERICA'S VITAL SKATEBOARD  MINING INDUSTRY? [LAUGHTER] BUT REMEMBER KIDS, WHEN BEING  CREATIVE, IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT  TO FOLLOW A RIGID SET OF RULES. ACCORDING TO THE RULES YOUR  DRAWING MUST BE A  TWO-DIMENSIONAL DRAWING OR  PAINTING, IT MUST BE 11 BY 17 INCHES, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY  DO NOT USE GLITTER! [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OKAY? GOOD THINKING. GLITTER CAN BE A REAL MESS. [LAUGHTER] YOU SPILL THAT STUFF AND IT IS  IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN UP. TOTAL DISASTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND GOD FORBID IT GETS ON ANY  WILDLIFE. THERE'S NO SADDER SIGHT THAN A  GLITTER-SOAKED PELICAN. [LAUGHTER] I HAD AN ACCIDENT AT A CRAFT  FAIR IN '98 AND I STILL HAVE A  BAD CASE OF DISCO LUNG. [COUGHS] [LAUGHTER] IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL BUY  OP SIX WE'LL BE RIGHT
