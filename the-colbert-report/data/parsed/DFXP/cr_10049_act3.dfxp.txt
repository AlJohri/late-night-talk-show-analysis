MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE EDITOR OF THE ATLANTIC. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED AGE OF ANXIETY: FEAR, HOPE, DREAD AND THE SEARCH FOR PEACE OF MIND. WELL HE'S NOT GONNA GET IT HERE. PLEASE WELCOME SCOTT STOSSEL. HEY, SCOTT, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
OKAY, I WILL GET TO YOUR BOOK IN A SECOND BUT FIRST YOU'RE THE EDITOR OF THE ATLANTIC, THE AUTHOR OF SARGE:  LIFE AND TIMES OF SARGENT SHRIVER, YOU HAVE WRITTEN FOR "THE NEW YORKER", NEW YORK TIMES, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, BUT YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED, MY AGE OF ANXIETY: FEAR, HOPE, DREAD AND THE SEARCH FOR PEACE OF MIND. WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY AGE OF ANXIETY? ARE YOU A PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS PERSON?
YES.
Stephen: ARE YOU ANXIOUS RIGHT NOW.
TERRIFIED.
Stephen: REALLY?
WELL, NO, I'M DOING OKAY. SO BASICALLY I HAVE SINCE THE AGE OF ABOUT 2 AS I SAY IN THE BOOK BEEN KIND OF A TWITCHY BUNDLE OF PHOBIAS, NEUROSES, ANXIETIES, ALL KINDS OF STRANGE IDIOSYNCRATIC PHOBIAS LIKE FOR INSTANCE CHEESE AND-- .
Stephen: YOU HAVE A FEAR OF CHEESE.
YEAH, I WILL NEVER GO TO WISCONSIN.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT ABOUT CHEESE THAT FRIGHTENS YOU.
IT'S UTTERLY-- WELL, IT'S IRRATIONAL-- .
Stephen: OKAY.
THIS IS WHAT IS SO PECULIAR ABOUT ANXIETY DISORDERS. BASICALLY YOU KNOW, I TELL PEOPLE THAT I WOULD RATHER BE BURIED IN A SARCOPHAGUS FULL OF SAY, RATS AND SNAKES WHICH I'M ACTUALLY NOT AFRAID OF THOUGH MANY PEOPLE ARE, THAN BE DIPPED INTO LIKE, SOME GORGONZOLA. (LAUGHTER) AND-- .
Stephen: SO NO CHEESE.
NO CHEESE.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE GOOD WITH VELVEETA THOUGH.
NO, NO, NOT EVEN VELVEETA. SO I SET OUT TO WRITE THIS BOOK BECAUSE I'VE STRUGGLED WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS ALL MY LIFE. AND I FINALLY, AND I WAS SORT OF FASCINATED BY THE NOTION OF LIKE WHAT CAUSED THIS. SO I, LOOKED DEEP INTO THE SCIENCE, THE CULTURE, THE HISTORY, IS IT GENETIC, HOW I WAS RAISED. AND I REALIZED. AND I ENDED UP WRITING THIS BOOK THAT ACTUALLY APPLIES TO THE 40 MILLION AMERICANS WHO ARE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS.
Stephen: LET'S BE CLEAR. ANXIETY AND FEAR, ARE THEY THE SAME THING? BECAUSE FEAR HAS GOT A NICE SHARP EDGE TO IT, ANXIETY CAN FEEL LIKE A SMOLDERING FIRE.
RIGHT. WELL, SO-- .
Stephen: .
I HAVE, I WOULD SAY A NORMALLY PRUDENT AVOIDANCE OF FIRE BUT THAT IS NOT ONE OF MY-- .
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT LIKE FRANKENSTEIN.
NO. NO, SO ANXIETY IS WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATELY DEPLOYED IS AN EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSE, AN ADAPTIVE EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSE, IT'S THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE. IN THE STATE OF NATURE IF YOU ARE WERE BEING ATTACKED BY A SABRE TOOTH TIGER OR ENEMY TRIBE.
Stephen: OR A PLATE OF GORGONZOLA. OR A PLATE OF GORGONZOLA.   [LAUGHTER]
IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY ADAPTIVE TO HAVE THIS RESPONSE WHERE YOUR ADRENALINE STARTS FIRING AND BLOOD FLOWS TO YOUR STRONG MUSCLES AND MAYBE YOU VOID YOUR BOWELS. BUT THAT HAPPENS.
Stephen: SURE.
IT LIGHTENS YOU TO BE ABLE TO RUN. BUT THE PROBLEM IS FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE ANXIETY DISORDERS, AND NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS BUT FOR ALL OF US IN MODERN LIFE, YOU ARE NOT OFTEN BEING CHASED BY A SABRE TOOTH TIGER. BUT THE SAME SORT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE HAPPENS WHEN YOUR WIFE GETS THE, YOU KNOW, MYSTERIOUS LETTER FROM HER EX-BOYFRIEND OR WHEN THE BOSS LOOKS AT YOU FUNNY. AND YOU HAVE THE SAME KIND OF FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE AND YOU END UP  KIND-OF-MARINATING IN THIS STEW OF UNUSED CHEMICALS STRESS HORMONES WHICH CAN BE VERY DAMAGING TO YOU OVER THE LONG TERM.
Stephen: SO WHAT, YOU SAID YOU HAVE HAD THIS SINCE YOU WERE TWO. DO YOU REMEMBER BEING AFRAID AT THAT AGE?
OH, YEAH, WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID I WAS ALWAYS CONVINCED AND AGAIN IN RETROSPECT, COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL I WAS ALWAYS CONVINCED THAT IF MY PARENTS WERE GONE, AND THIS IS CALLED SEPARATION ANXIETY WHICH IS A NORMAL DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE WHEN YOU ARE THREE OR FOUR. I HAD IT WHEN I WAS THREE  AND FOUR ACUTELY BUT THEN I HAD IT WHEN I WAS NINE, 10, 11 AND 12, AND I USED TO TORMENT MY POOR SISTER WHO WAS TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME. AND IF MY PARENTS WEREN'T THERE AND AT A PARTY AND 15 MINUTES LATE I WOULD MAKE HER CALL THE PARTY AND SAY LIKE, I'M SORRY, I'M SCOTT'S BROTHER, HE'S CRAZY, ARE HIS PARENTS STILL ALIVE.
Stephen: SO IF YOUR PARENTS WEREN'T THERE YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE GONE FOREVER.
I WAS CONVINCED, IT WAS NOT RATIONAL BUT I WAS CONVINCED THAT THEY EITHER WERE NOT REALLY MY PARENTS OR WERE CONDUCTING SOME SORT OF HORRIBLE EXPERIMENT AND HAD JUST DECIDED TO LEAVE.
Stephen: SO PEEKABOO WAS NOT A LOT OF FUN FOR YOU.
PEEKABOO WAS TERRIFYING.
Stephen: SO WHAT DO YOU DO? HOW DO YOU TREAT IT? BECAUSE IN YEARS PAST, THIS SORT OF THING WOULD BE TREATED BY AND I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THIS  CORRECTLY-- ALCOHOL. [LAUGHTER] HOW DO YOU AND HOW DO 40 MILLION OTHER PEOPLE TREAT THIS KIND OF ANXIETY.
SO I HAVE, I'VE TRIED LOTS OF THINGS BUT I AM MEDICATED AND AGAIN THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THAT I NEVER ADMITTED BECAUSE I WAS ASHAMED OF IT, BUT I TAKE ANTI-DEPRESSANTS,  BENZODIAZEPINES, WHICH ARE, UH, UH UH
Stephen: LIKE XANAX?
XANAX, WHICH IS AN ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION.
Stephen: DID YOU BRING ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE CLASS.
I HAVE SOME, DO YOU WANT ME TO SHARE, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE AFRAID OF.
WELL, OKAY,.
Stephen: YOU NAME YOURS AND I WILL NAME MINE.
OKAY.
Stephen: I WILL GO FIRST, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. (LAUGHTER)
I DON'T KNOW THE TERM FOR THAT ONE BUT THAT'S A GOOD ONE. WELL, CHEESE, TUROPHOBIA. MY MOST ACUTE ONE AND LONGEST  STANDING AND THIS IS, I THINK COMPLETELY RATIONAL BUT I KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK IT'S IRRATIONAL, EMETOPHOBIA WHICH IS THE FIFTH MOST COMMON PHOBIA, WHICH IS PATHOLOGICAL FEAR OF VOMITING WHICH I HAVE NOT DONE SINCE 1977.
Stephen: IS IT YOU'LL VOMIT OR THAT SOMEONE WILL VOMIT ON YOU?
THAT I WILL VOMIT.
Stephen: THAT'S MY FEAR. SO WHAT DO YOU DO, HOW DO YOU TREAT IT.
I COULD VOMIT ON YOU RIGHT NOW AND I WOULD BE CURED AND YOU WOULD BE CURED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DO YOU HAVE A GOOD CUSTODIAL STAFF HERE? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SCOTT STOSSEL. THE BOOK IS MY AGE OF ANXIETY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
