Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [EAGLE CAW] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANGT STEPHEN] [CROWD  CHANTING STEPHEN B.C.]
Stephen: THANK YOU SOX  PLEASE, SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, WELCOME TO CHIT CHAT,  WHERE WE GIRLS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE GIRLS JUST SIT AROUND AND  TALK TO EACH OTHER. NATION, YOU KNOW IF YOU WATCH  THE SHOW, ONE OF HARDEST THING  ABOUT BE ME IS ALWAYS BEING  RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] NO ONE WILL WATCH BASEBALL WITH  ME ANYMORE, BECAUSE I CORRECTLY  PREDICT EVERY PITCH WILL BE BORING. I'M LIKE CASSANDRA. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, LO, IT HATH COME ONCE MORE  TO PASS JUST AS I SPAKETH IT  LAST FALL, WHEN I BROUGHT YOU NEWS OF A STUDY THAT FOUND MEN  ARE SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO THEIR  FEMALE PLATONIC FRIENDS. MEN WERE ALSO MORE ATTRACTED TO  FEMALE ACQUAINTANCES, FEMALE  STRANGERS THEY SAW ON THE STREET, PICTURES OF WOMEN ON  BILLBOARDS, SEARS CATALOGS, AND  PARTICULARLY PLUMP COUCH  CUSHIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OH, SURE. EVERYBODY LAUGHED. WELL, LET'S SEE THEM LAUGH AT  THIS! "MAN HAS SEX WITH A SOFA IN THE  STREET." [ LAUGHTER ] EVIDENTLY, A 46-YEAR-OLD MAN IN  WAUKESHA, WISCONSIN, SEEN HERE  IN HIS eHARMONY PROFILE, WAS ARRESTED FOR GETTING ALL SEXUAL  WITH A SECTIONAL. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW I KNOW THERE'S NOT MUCH TO  DO IN WISCONSIN, BUT COME ON,  BUDDY-- HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF METH? YOU SEEM LIKE A NATURAL. [ LAUGHTER ] AND LOOK, FOLKS, I GET NO  SATISFACTION FROM THE FACT THAT  I CALLED THIS. AND UNLIKE THE  LET-IT-ALL-HANG-OUT LIBERALS OUT  THERE, I AM WILLING TO COME OUT AND SAY THAT ROADSIDE  SOFA-BONING IS WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT'S NEXT:  PUBLIC SCHOOLS TEACHING OUR  CHILDREN ABOUT SAFE SEX-- AND HANDING OUT PLASTIC SLIPCOVERS  TO PUT IN THEIR WALLETS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW IT'S EASY TO BLAME THIS  46-YEAR-OLD MAN FOR JUST ABOUT  ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT FRANKLY A LOT OF THESE  COUCHES ARE ASKING YOU TO SLEEP  WITH THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SLUT! [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS WHAT THE COUNTRY HAS  COME TO. [ LAUGHTER ] ANOTHER THING I'M NOT HAPPY  ABOUT, FOLKS:  OBAMA'S FAILED SECOND TERM. IT DOESN'T START FOR TWO WEEKS  AND IT IS A DISASTER. POINT IS, I GAVE IT A CHANCE. EVEN MEMBERS OF OBAMA'S CABINET  ARE JUMPING OFF THE S.S. BARACK  LIKE RATS LEAVING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE PRIVATE  SECTOR. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE THING THAT DISTURBS ME  AND MY FELLOW PUNDITS WITH AIR  TIME TO FILL, IS WHO OBAMA HAS PICKED TO REPLACE THEM.
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS PICTURE. ASK YOURSELF. LOOK CLOSELY. WHAT'S MISSING?
DO YOU NOTICE SOMETHING? THERE ARE NO WOMEN IN THE  PICTURE.
WHERE HAVE THE WOMEN GONE?
IT SHOWS THE PRESIDENT WITH  SENIOR ADVISERS IN THE OVAL  OFFICE, ALL OF THEM ARE MALE.
Stephen: THOSE FOUR WHITE  GUYS ARE RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE 21st CENTURY. WHEN FILLING HIS CABINET,  THERE'S ONLY ONE QUESTION HE  SHOULD BE ASKING:
HEY, WHERE THE WHITE WOMEN  AT? [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. FOLKS, LOOK. THIS PICTURE IS DAMNING. AND I DON'T CARE IF 43% OF  OBAMA'S APPOINTEES HAVE BEEN  WOMEN. THEY'RE NOT IN THIS PHOTO. I LIVE BY ONE RULE. IF I CAN'T SEE IT, IT DOES NOT  EXIST-- OH, MY GOD! WHERE'S MY HAND?! OHH. I THOUGHT OBAMA TOOK IT. DON'T EVER SCARE ME LIKE THAT  AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, OBAMA'S NOT LETTING  ME DOWN. I LOVE WHITE MEN. I SLEEP WITH ONE EVERY NIGHT  THAT I KNOW OF. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, FOLKS, I'M HEARTBROKEN FOR  MY LIBERAL FRIENDS. AND SO IS FORMER GOVERNOR AND  FORMERLY RELEVANT MIKE HUCKABEE, [ LAUGHTER ] WHO WAS PUBLICALLY WORRIED ABOUT  THEM ON HIS RADIO SHOW.
NOW A LOT OF THOSE FEMALES  WHO SUPPORTED BARACK OBAMA ARE  SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS, AND THEY'RE SAYING, "WHOA! HOW COME  THERE IS SO MUCH TESTOSTERONE IN  THE OBAMA CABINET AND SO LITTLE ESTROGEN?"" [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: YES, HUCKABEE AND  HUCKA-ME ARE OUTRAGED ON BEHALF  OF YOU ESTROGEN SOAKED FEMALES. BECAUSE OBAMA'S NOT TURNING OUT  THE WAY YOU WANTED HIM TO. IF ANYTHING, HE'S TURNING OUT  THE WAY WE WANT HIM TO. AND THAT SHOULD MAKE YOU FURIOUS  THAT WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT YOU'RE  ANGRY. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY, THE  FIRST LADY IS AN AFRICAN  AMERICAN WOMAN, BUT WHO KNOWS IF SHE'S STAYING? THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING, SHE  LEAVES AND THE PRESIDENT  REPLACES HER WITH LARRY SUMMERS. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DOES HE GET THOSE AMAZING  ARMS? [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT JUST  THAT THEY'RE WHITE MEN. IT'S WHICH WHITE MEN. AS YOU KNOW, TREASURY SECRETARY  TIMOTHY GEITHNER IS STEPPING  DOWN TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIS  FOREHEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND WHO IS OBAMA PICKING TO  REPLACE HIM?
PRESIDENT OBAMA NOMINATED  JACK LEW AS A PRESIDENTRY  SECRETARY.
JACK LEW WHO?
JACK LEW. WHO IS JACK LEW? WHO IS THAT?
Stephen: YEAH, WHO IS THAT? JACK LEW. 'CUZ I DON'T KNOW WHO JACK LEW  IS-- AND NEITHER DO YOU. THAT'S NOT A PICTURE OF JACK  LEW. THIS IS, AND YOU DIDN'T NOTICE. YOU RACIST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THERE'S BIG PROBLEMS WITH  THIS GUY.
HEARD THE DISCUSSION THAT  REPUBLICANS REALLY JUST DON'T  GET ALONG WITH THIS GUY, THEY DON'T AGREE WITH HIS PHILOSOPHY,  THEY THINK HE'S REALLY HARD TO  DEAL WITH IN NEGOTIATION.
Stephen: NO NO, JIMMY--  -- NO, NO, THE BIG PROBLEM.
THERE'S JACK LEW'S SIGNATURE.
Stephen: FOLKS, ONCE LEW'S  TREASURY SECRETARY, THIS PUBIC  HAIR MASQUERADING AS AN AUTOGRAPH WILL APPEAR ON ALL OUR  MONEY, OKAY? MAKING OUR CURRENCY A  LAUGHINGSTOCK. OUR MONEY SHOULD HAVE NOTHING  RIDICULOUS ON IT, JUST OLD MEN  IN WIGS AND PYRAMIDS WITH EYES. IS THIS EVEN A SIGNATURE OR DID  HE START DRAWING CHARLIE BROWN  AND GIVE UP AFTER THE HAIR? [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD GRIEF. AND IT GOT NO BETTER WHEN LEW  EXPLAINED HIS FISCAL PHILOSOPHY,  SAYING QUOTE "I DESCRIBE BUDGETS AS A TAPESTRY: WHEN IT'S WOVEN  TOGETHER, THE PICTURE AMOUNTS TO  OUR HOPES AND DREAMS OF A NATION." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DIDN'T GET A WORD OF THAT. FOLKS, THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR  BILL DESERVES A SIGNATURE WORTHY  OF A GREAT NATION. SO TO PRESERVE THE VALUE OF THE  MONEY, I WANT YOU TO SEND IT TO  ME. I'LL ERASE HIS SIGNATURE AND  REPLACE IT WITH MINE, AND THEN  RETURN IT TO YOU, MINUS A SMALL HANDLING FEE. [ LAUGHTER ]
