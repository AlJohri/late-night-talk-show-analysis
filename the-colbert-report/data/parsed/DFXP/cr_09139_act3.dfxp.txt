(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH  REPRESENTATIVE JOHN LEWIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  CONGRESSMAN LEWIS, YOUR NEW BOOK  IS CALLED "MARCH, BOOK   1. " THIS IS A GRAPHIC NOVEL. ESSENTIALLY A COMIC BOOK OF YOUR  EARLY DAYS IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS  MOVEMENT. IS THAT DIGNIFIED ENOUGH FOR THE  CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT? BECAUSE WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE GOT  AT STAKE IS JUST DIGNITY. IS THIS LOWERING THE DIGNITY OF  CIVIL RIGHTS BY MAKING IT A  COMIC BOOK. IT IS NOT LOWERING THE DIGNITY  OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THERE WAS ANOTHER COMIC BOOK  THAT CAME OUT IN 1957 WHEN I WAS  17 YEARS OLD IT WAS THE MARTIN LUTHER KING STORY OF THE  MONTGOMERY MOVEMENT. IT WAS CALLED "MARTIN LUTHER  KING, JR. AND THE MONTGOMERY  STORY."
Stephen: SO THERE WAS A  COMIC BOOK OF MARTIN LUTHER KING  IN 1957?
IT SOLD FOR TEN CENTS. ONLY TEN CENTS.
Stephen: THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS. "MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., THE  MONTGOMERY STORY, HOW   50,000  NEGROES FOUND A NEW WAY TO END RACIAL DISCRIMINATION."  DID YOU BUY THIS?
WELL, SOMEONE GAVE ME A COPY. I DIDN'T HAVE TEN CENTS AND I  READ IT AND REREAD IT AND THIS  BOOK INSPIRED ME WHEN I WENT AWAY TO SCHOOL IN NASHVILLE,  TENNESSEE. AND INSPIRED OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE.
Stephen: HAD YOU MET  DR. KING AT THE TIME?
I DIDN'T MEET HIM UNTIL 1958.
Stephen: SO YOU HAD THIS  BEFORE YOU MET DR. KING. SO THIS WOULD BE LIKE MEETING  SUPERMAN TO YOU! (LAUGHTER)
WELL, IT WAS MEET MIG HERO. HE BECAME MY HERO. HE BECAME MY INSPIRATION, MY  LEADER. HE INSPIRED ME TO SAY NO TO  SEGREGATION AND RACIAL  DISCRIMINATION. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP 50 MILES  FROM MONTGOMERY I SAW THOSE  SIGNS THAT SAID "WHITE MEN" "COLORED MEN" "WHITE WOMEN"  "COLORED WOMEN" AND I WOULD ASK  MY MOTHER, FATHER, GRANDPARENTS? WHY THEY WOULD SAY "THAT'S THE  WAY IT IS. DON'T GET IN TROUBLE. BUT ROSA PARKS AND MARTIN LUTHER  KING, JR. INSPIRED ME TO GET IN  TROUBLE. SO FOR MORE THAN 53 YEARS I'VE  BEEN GETTING IN TROUBLE. GOOD TROUBLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELL, LET'S TALK  ABOUT TROUBLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT TROUBLE FOR A  SECOND BECAUSE THE VOTING RIGHTS  ACT WAS RECENTLY GUTTED BY THE SUPREME COURT WHEN THEY SAID  THAT THE CRITERIA THAT JUDGED  SERB STATES THAT HAD A PERMANENT PLACE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF  THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WERE TO BE  THROWN OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE NO LONGER APPLICABLE. YOU WANT TO REINSTATE CERTAIN  PART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. WHY DO WE NEED TO DO THAT? BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT SAID  RACISM IS OVER NOW. (LAUGHTER)  AREN'T YOU KIND OF BEING THE  RACIST? (LAUGHTER)  NO OFFENSE.
NO, IT'S OKAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE'RE NOT THERE YET. WE'RE NOT LIVING IN A  POST-RACIAL SOCIETY. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO THINK  BECAUSE WE ELECTED AN AFRICAN  AMERICAN PRESIDENT IT'S OVER. IT'S FINISHED.
Stephen: I LIKE TO THINK  THAT. DOESN'T THAT FEEL GOOD TO SAY,  THOUGH? DOESN'T IT FEEL GOOD TO SAY  RACISM IS OVER? FEELS BETTER THAN SAYING IT'S  NOT OVER. THAT MAKES ME SAD.
IT MAKES ME SAD NOT KNOWING  THAT IT'S NOT OVER.
I DON'T SEE RACE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCHED THE  SHOW EARLIER. BUT I DON'T SEE RACE -- I DON'T  KNOW IF I'M WHITE OR YOU'RE  BLACK. I ASSUME YOU'RE BLACK BECAUSE I  HAVE A DESIRE TO FRISK YOU RIGHT  NOW. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, PLEASE DON'T. YOU MAY FIND SOMETHING ON ME SO  PLEASE DON'T FRISK ME.
Stephen: IS THERE GOING TO  BE A BOOK TWO?
BOOK TWO, BOOK THREE AND IT  WILL TELL THE WHOLE STORY, THE  COMPLETE STORY. I LOVE WHAT MY COAUTHOR AND NATE  PILE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH  THE WORRIES. IT'S DRAMA, PASSION, IT MAKES  THIS BOOK SING.
Stephen: SINCE YOU'RE THE  HERO OF THIS GRAPHIC NOVEL, DO  YOU HAVE A SUPERPOWER?
WELL, I CAN MAKE THINGS  HAPPEN. YOU KNOW, IT PREACH OR SPEAK IN  RURAL ALABAMA TO THOSE CHICKENS  AND SOMETIMES THEY WOULD SAY "AMEN."  (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: PREACH TO  CHICKENS, THAT COULD COME IN  HANDY. REPRESENTATIVE LEWIS, THANK YOU  SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. JOHN LEWIS, THE BOOK IS "MARCH."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
