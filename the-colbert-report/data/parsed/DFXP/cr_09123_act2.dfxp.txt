Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I AM A FAMILY  PERSON WHO HAS A BIG SHOW LIKE  THIS. IT'S NO SECRET THAT I LEAD A  KIND OF BUSY LIFE SO I DO A LOT  OF MULTITASKING. FOR INSTANCE, RIGHT NOW I AM  BOTH DOING THIS SHOW AND  WATCHING IT ON UP ON THESE MONITORS UP HERE. ALTHOUGH I'VE GOT TO SAY RIGHT  NOW I'M DOING A LITTLE BIT MORE  WATCHING. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT I'M  GOING TO SAY NEXT. NOT MUCH GOING ON RIGHT NOW. ANYWAY, WE'LL GET BACK TO THIS  LATER. SOMEBODY TIVO THIS, OKAY. UNFORTUNATELY FOR MULTITASKERS  LIKE ME, I HEARD SOME VERY  DISTURBING NEWS RECENTLY ON THE  N.P.R. ACTUALLY LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE I  WAS HALF LISTENING AND HALF  CUTTING UP VEGETABLES FOR SOUP. HERE'S N.P.R. AS IRA FLATOW ONE  OF MY TOP TWO PUBLIC RADIO IRAS.
MULTITASKING MAY BE AFFECTING  OUR ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE,  MANAGE OUR EMOTIONS, MAYBE THINK  CREATIVELY.
THE RESEARCH IS ALMOST  UNANIMOUS. PEOPLE WHO MULTITASK SHOW ANY  NORNLG US RANGE OF DEFICITS. THEY'RE BASICALLY TERRIBLE AT  ALL SORTS OF COGNITIVE TASKS  INCLUDING MULTITASKING.
Stephen: MULTITASKERS ARE  TERRIBLE AT ALL SORTS OF  COGNITIVE TASKS BUT IN THEIR DEFENSE THEY'RE TERRIBLE AT THEM  AT THE SAME TIME. BUT FINE, I'LL BITE. WHAT ARE THESE MULTITASKS THEY  MULTI-SUCK AT?
WE HAVE SCALES THAT ALLOW US  TO DIVIDE UP PEOPLE. THE DIFFERENCES ARE REMARKABLE. PEOPLE WHO MULTITASK ALL THE  TIME CAN'T FILTER OUT  IRRELEVANCY. THEY CAN'T MANAGE A WORKING  MEMORY. THEY'RE CHRONICALLY DISTRACTED.
Stephen: OH, SORRY. THIS CROOKED FRAME WAS DRIVING  ME NUTS. ANYWHERE, WHERE WAS I? RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, THE SHOW. NOW ANYWAY, N.P.R. WAS TELLING  ME THAT MULTITASKING IS A MYTH  WHICH IS IRONIC BECAUSE N.P.R. IS GREAT AT IT. THEY SIMULTANEOUSLIEN RAGE ME  AND WASTE MY TAX DOLLARS. WELL, CLEARLY THESE RESEARCHERS  SPOKE TO THE WRONG MULTITASKERS  BECAUSE SOME OF US KNOW HOW TO DO IT AND SOME DON'T. IT'S A SIMPLE MATTER OF FOCUS  HERE. I'LL SHOW YOU. FIRST OF ALL, I'M JUST GOING TO  DO A LITTLE ONLINE SHOPPING,  ALSO CONFIRM MY TEE TIME THIS WEEK END WITH MY BUDDY CHAD  WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKING  MYSELF A DELICIOUS TOAST SNACK. THERE THAT GOES IN THERE. SET THAT TO GOLDEN BROWN. AND THERE WE GO. OKAY. I LIKE THOSE BLACKS IN NAN... SLACKS IN NANTUCKET RED. TAKE THOSE IN MEN'S PETITE. SLIM CUT. BOOT LEG. STRETCH WASTE. AMPLE SEAT. THERE YOU GO. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. NOW. CHAD, 11:00 WORKS BETTER FOR ME  AND SEND. OKAY. THE QUESTION IS AM I GOING TO  HAVE APRICOT JAM OR STRAWBERRY? YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK I'LL MULTI-SNACK AND  HAVE BOTH. CHOALD ON ONE SECOND. CHINO IS GOLFING WITH US. WHO'S CHINO? MEXICANS DON'T GOLF. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. OKAY. LET'S SEE. WHY DOES CHAD WANT MY CREDIT  CARD INFORMATION? THAT DOESN'T MAKE... HEY, THE  TOAST IS READY. SMELLS AMAZING! MMMMM. WAIT. HOLD ON ONE SECOND. I FEEL SO TERRIBLE FOR PEOPLE  WHO HAVE TO GIVE UP THE GLUTEN. CREDIT CARD DENIED? I BETTER JUST CALL THEM. SIRI, CALL J-CREW. J-CREW, J-CREW! THESE THINGS REALLY DO SUCK AS  PHONES. ANYWAY DAMN, I BURNED IT. (DOORBELL) COME IN.
YOU ORDERED DELIVERY. Stephen: OH, MY PANTS ARE  HERE ALREADY. THANKS, CHINO.
I'M PHIL. Stephen: I'M JUST A LITTLE  FRAZZLED. HERE'S YOUR TIP. THAT REMINDS ME, I BETTER GET  BACK TO CHAD. THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE. CHAD, SEE YOU ON THE GREEN SEND. SEE? MULTITASKING IS NO BIG DEAL. NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'VE  GOT TO GO PICK UP MY CAR FROM  THE VET AND MY CAT FROM THE  SHOP. POOR GUY HAD HIS MUFFLER  REMOVED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
