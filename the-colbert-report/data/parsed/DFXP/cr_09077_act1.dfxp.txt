Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN? ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US. PLEASE, FOLKS, SIT DOWN. WE HAVE TO GET TO IT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I  UNDERSTAND -- I UNDERSTAND YOUR  ENERGY. I SHARE YOUR CONCERN, AND I JOIN  YOU IN YOUR RIGHTEOUS  INDIGNATION BECAUSE FOLKS WE'RE AT A CROSS ROADS AS A NATION. A MOMENT OF CRISIS THAT KEN  BURNS WILL ONE DAY DOCUMENT WITH  BLACK AND WHITE FOAT YEENS MOURNFUL FIDDLE MUSIC. [LAUGHTER] FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS THE  SUPREME COURT HAS HEARD  ARGUMENTS OVER WHETHER THE  CONSTITUTION MANDATES THAT WE ALL GET GAY MARRIED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, THE PRO-GAY MARRIAGE  CROWD RALLIED ON THE SUPREME  COURT STEPS AND I PERSONALLY WANT TO SALUTE THIS GUY FOR  WEARING THE HOT PINK DEVIL HORN  DRAG. THAT IS HOW YOU WIN THE HEARTS  AND THE MINDS OF AVERAGE  AMERICANS. AFTER ALL IT'S EXACTLY WHAT  MARTIN LUTHER KING WORE AT THE  MARCH ON WASHINGTON. I CANNOT BELIEVE HE MADE IT TO  THE MOUNTAINTOP IN THOSE HEELS. WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS IS WHAT  GAY RIGHTS IS LEADING TO. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE MARRIAGE DESTROYERS KEEP  TROTTING HOMOSEXUALS LIKE THE  PLAINTIFF IN THE DOMA CASE ADORABLE 83-YEAR-OLD LESBIAN  WIDOW WHO MADE THE CASE WHY HER  RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE CALLED  MARRIAGE.
IT'S A MAGIC WORD FOR ANYBODY  WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE  WANT IT AND WHY WE NEED IT. OKAY, IT'S MAGIC.
Stephen: THEY ARE TUGGING  AT YOUR HEARTSTRINGS OR AS  LESBIANS CALL IT SCISSORING. SICK STUFF. LA LAUGH ON THE PRO-GAY SIDE YOU  GOT YOUR KAGAN, BREYER, WISE  LATINA AND GINSBURG WHO ACTED ALL SURPRISE THAT THE DEFENSE OF  MARRIAGE ACT MAKES THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT TREAT GAY COUPLES DIFFERENTLY FROM STRAIGHT  COUPLES.
YOU ARE SAYING THERE'S TWO  KINDS OF MARRIAGES THE FULL  MARRIAGE AND SKIM MILK MARRIAGE.
Stephen: YES, SKIM MILK  MARRIAGE. I HAVE ALWAYS SUSPECTED THAT  SKIM MILK WAS GAY. FOR GOD SAKE IT HAS HOMOGENIZED  ON IT. FOR PETE'S SAKE SEAN PENN WON AN  OSCAR FOR IT. DON'T CALL ME A BIGOT BECAUSE  I'M LACTOSE INTOLERANT. 2% THAT IS STRAIGHT MISSIONARY. HALF AND HALF, COME ON. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOGURT, I THINK WE ALL KNOW  WHAT THAT FRUIT IS DOING ON THE  BOTTOM. [ LAUGHTER ] PLUS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  GIVING HOMOSEXUAL MARRIAGES  FEDERAL RECOGNITION MEANS GIVING THEM BENEFITS MEANT FOR STRAIGHT  COUPLES.
THINK SOCIAL SECURITY  BENEFITS, FEDERAL ESTATE AND  INCOME TAXES AS WELL AS MEDICAL AND FAMILY LEAVE. SAME-SEX COUPLES WHO ARE LEGALLY  MARRIED DO NOT GET THEM SIMPLY  BECAUSE THEY ARE GAY.
Stephen: NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE  THEY ARE GAY. BECAUSE THEY ARE GAY AND WE WANT  TO PUNISH THEM FOR IT. AND THOSE 1100 RIGHTS ARE WHAT  MAKES TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE  SPECIAL, THINGS LIKE JOINT TAX  FILING. SPONSORING A SPOUSE'S VISA,  LOWERING MINING CLAIM  MAINTENANCE FEES AND MOST SACRED OF ALL THE RIGHT OF A WIDOW TO  INHERENT GUANO ISLANDS WHICH ARE  UNOCCUPIED ISLANDS COVERED IN FECES FROM BATS, BEAVERS AND  SEALS. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT WE'RE  GOING TO GIVE THAT TO GAY PEOPLE  NOW? THAT'S WHAT MARRIAGE IS ABOUT. IT WAS IN MY VOWS DO YOU,  STEPHEN, TAKE THIS WOMAN FOR  BETTER AND FOR WORSE IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH UNLESS DEATH DO  YOU PART AND LEAVE HER A TURD  COVERED ROCK IN THE SEAS. I SAID, I DO DO. IF A GAY PERSON WANTS TO INHERT  HIS PARTNER'S GUANO ISLAND I SAY  THEY ARE (bleep) OUT OF LUCK. THANK GOD, FOLKS, OPPOSING THE  LIBERALS ARE THE CONSERVATIVE  FAB FOUR, ROBERTS, THE CUTE ONE, ALITO, THE SMART ONE, SCALIA,  THE LUMPY ONE AND THOMAS THE  SCALIA ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] THESE STALWARTS ARE JOINED BY  THE LAWYER DEFENDING TRADITIONAL  MARRIAGE CHARLES COOPER WHO COME UP WITH ONE HUMDINGER OF AN  ARGUMENT.
THE CONCERN IS THAT  REDEFINING MARRIAGE AS A  GENDERLESS INSTITUTION WILL SEVER ITS ABIDING CONNECTION TO  ITS HISTORIC TRADITIONAL  PROCREATED PURPOSES.
Stephen: THANK YOU. MARRIAGE IS FOR PROCREATION  ONLY. IF YOU LOSE THAT REQUIREMENT IT  WILL CONFUSE THE ISSUE AND  STRAIGHT COUPLES WILL FORGET WHY THEY ARE HAVING SEX. THE SPERM GETS HALF WAY TO THE  AGE AND SAY I DON'T FEEL A  CONNECTION FOR MARRIAGE'S  PURPOSES. BACK TO THE PEE HOLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SADLY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] SADLY, THESE DAYS MOST PEOPLE  KNOW A GAY OR TWO WHICH CLOUDS  OUR ABILITY TO OBJECTIVELY SEE THEM AS A FROTHING PILE OF SEX  CRAZED DEVIANTS. EVEN CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS HAS A  GAY CONNECTION.
EXPECTED IN THE AUDIENCE JEAN  PADRASKI OF SAN FRANCISCO AND  HER PARTNER SHSMS A LESBIAN COUSIN OF CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN  ROBERTS. SHE SAID I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT  SOCIETY IS BECOME MORE ACCEPTING  OF HUMANITY OF SAME-SEX COUPLES AND THE SIM TRUTH WE DESERVE  DIGNITY, RESPECT AND EQUALITY  UNDER THE LAW.
Stephen: THAT IS GOING BE  ONE AWKWARD THANKSGIVING. MAY I HAVE MASHED POTATOES AND  SWEET POTATOES ARE ARE THOSE TWO  THINGS TOO SIMILAR TO SHARE A PLATE AND RUIN YOUR THANKSGIVING  VALUES. EVEN THOUGH THEY TASTE GREAT  TOGETHER AND ARE PERFECT FOR  EACH OTHER. IF ANYONE NEEDS ME, I'LL BE IN  THE CAR. IT'S FOUR FOUR WHICH MEANS THE  ENTIRE FUTURE OF MARRIAGE IN  THIS COUNTRY RESTS WITH JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY THE MAN WHO  DECLARED IN CITIZENS UNITED THAT  CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE WITH CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. I PRAY HE DOESN'T DO SOMETHING  RASH LIKE DECLARING HOMOSEXUALS  PEOPLE WITH CONSTITUTIONAL  RIGHTS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THE DECISION WILL NOT BE  HANDED DOWN FOR MONTHS SO  THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT THE COURT WILL DECIDE. HERE TO TELL ME WHAT THE COURT  WILL DECIDE IS SLATE SENIOR  EDITOR AND RESEARCH FELLOW EMILY  BAZELON. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET INTO THIS. OKAY, THE PROP 8 DECISION,  THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA LAW THAT  SAYS NO GAY MARRIAGE, THAT WAS STRUCK DOWN BY A LOWER COURT. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN THERE?
A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS COULD  HAPPEN. THE SUPREME COURT COULD UPHOLD  PROPOSITION 8, NO GAY MARRIAGE  IN CALIFORNIA. THE SUPREME COURT FOR A COUPLE  DIFFERENT REASONS WILL DISMISS  THE CASE, DECIDE THE WRONG PARTIES WERE THERE.
Stephen: THEY ALREADY SAID  WE'LL HEART CASE.
BUT THEY COULD STILL CHANGE  THEIR MIND. IF THAT HAPPENED THE LOWER COURT  RULING WOULD STAND THERE AND  WOULD BE GAY MARRIAGE IN  CALIFORNIA.
Stephen: IF THEY SAY WE'RE  NOT GOING TO HEAR IT IT'S DE  FACTO GO GAIETY UP. TECHNICALLY, LEGAL TECHNICALLY.
TECHNICALLY.
Stephen: THERE'S ANOTHER  GAY MARRIAGE CASE UNNATURALLY  JOINED AT THE PROP 8. IT'S CALLED DOMEA. DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY?
THE PART OF IT CONTESTED  DEFINES MARRIAGE AS THE UNION OF  A MAN AND A WOMAN FOR PURPOSING OF GIVING OUT FEDERAL BENEFITS.
Stephen: WHAT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN THERE?
THE LOWER COURT STRUCK DOWN  THAT PART OF THE DEFENSE OF  MARRIAGE ACT IN STATES THAT RECOGNIZED GAY MARRIAGE AS LEGAL  THEY SAID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  HAD TO FOLLOW THE STATE'S DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE BECAUSE  TRADITIONALLY WE GIVE STATES  MORE SAY OVER MARRIAGE LAWS.
Stephen: DOES IT LOOK LIKE  IT'S GOING TO GET STRUCK DOWN OR  UPHELD?
IT LOOKS LIKE DOMA IS GOING  DOWN.
Stephen: IF IT LOOKS LIKE  DOMA IS GOING DOWN AND PROBABLY  THEY'LL PUNT ON PROP 8 THAT MEANS MARRIAGE WOULD BE LEGAL IN  CALIFORNIA.
GAY MARRIAGE.
Stephen: GAY MARRIAGE,  SORRY WHICH IS ALL MARRIAGE NOW  I THINK. HAVE YOU FOUND YOUR GAY PARTNER  YET BECAUSE WE'LL BE FORCED TO  DO IT.
I'LL LOOK.
Stephen: GET A GOOD ONE. I'M GOING WITH RYAN GOSLING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF GAY MARRIAGE STAYS LEGAL IN  CALIFORNIA THAT'S A FIFTH OF  UNITED STATES POPULATION RIGHT  THERE. >>S IF A LOT OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: THOSE PEOPLE, THE  GAY PEOPLE CAN GET GET MARRIED  AND MOVE TO OTHER STATES, RIGHT?
THEY WOULD STILL BE MARRIED  ALTHOUGH THE OTHER STATES WOULD  BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER TO RECOGNIZE.
Stephen: BUT THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT WOULD RECOGNIZE THEM  AS BEING MARRIED BECAUSE THEY GOT MARRIED IN CALIFORNIA.
NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE THE  CHALLENGE TO DOMA APPLIES TO THE  STATES THAT RECOGNIZE GAY MARRIAGE AS LEGAL.
Stephen: IF I GET GAY  MARRIED IN CALIFORNIA AND THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID YES, YOU ARE MARRIED AND WE RECOGNIZE. THAT HERE IS YOUR TAX, WHATEVER. THEN I MOVE TO GEORGIA, THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS YOU  CAN'T FILE TOGETHER ON A FEDERAL  LEVEL?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: I'M NOT A FAN AND  I THINK THAT'S (bleep).
WELL --
Stephen: THAT MEANS, AND  WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU TALKING,  TOO, BUT SO LITERALLY I WOULD -- IF I WERE GAY I WOULD GET  STRIPPED OF MY GAY MARRIAGE  RIGHTS FEDERALLY IF I WALKED ACROSS THE BORDER.
IF YOU MOVED YOU WOULD LOSE  THE FEDERAL BENEFITS. THE SCENARIO YOU JUST DREW OUT  IS CRAZY. WE WOULD HAVE A PATCHWORK OF  MARRIAGE LAWS THBD WOULD BE THE  NEXT CHALLENGE.
Stephen: LET ME POSE THE  QUESTION TO SCHEEA. WHEN DID GAY MARRIAGE BECOME A  CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT? WHEN DID WE START ACCEPTING  THAT? GIVE ME THE DATE.
IT'S RECENTLY BUT I DON'T  THINK YOU CAN PUT AN EXACT DATE  ON IT.
Stephen: YOU CAN. IT WAS SEPTEMBER 19, 2005 THE  PREMIERE OF HOW I MET YOUR  MOTHER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE NEIL PATRICK HARRIS  PLAYS A SUPER STRAIGHT HORN DOG  AND WE BUY IT. WILL YOU STICK AROUND FOR A  SECOND MORE AND WE'LL GO TO  COMMERCIAL, COME BACK AND FIGURE IT OUT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE  FROM EMILY BAZEL
