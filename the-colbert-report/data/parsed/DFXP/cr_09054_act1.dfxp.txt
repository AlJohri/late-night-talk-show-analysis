Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH,  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. YOU ARE TOO KIND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE BROADCAST. THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU IN HERE, OUT THERE,  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU  FOR JOINING US. PHONE LINES ARE OPEN. [ LAUGHTER ] NATION, WE ARE JUST DAYS AWAY  FROM SUPER BOWL SUNDAY. AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PUMPED. IT'S LIKE FOOTBALL CHRISTMAS, IF  CHRISTMAS WERE MORE  COMMERCIALIZED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT  FOOTBALL-- THE SWEET SCIENCE,  THE PICK AND ROLL, FROM DOWNTOWN, YOU SUNK MY  BATTLESHIP! YAHTZEE! [ LAUGHTER ] I'M JUST DYING TO SEE THE SAN  FRANCISCO-- EARTHQUAKES-- FACE [ LAUGHTER ] OFF AGAINST THE BALTIMORE, I  WANNA SAY, TRASHCAN FIRES?! [ LAUGHTER ] SO PUT ON YOUR GAME FACE, THEN  SHOVE NACHOS INTO THAT GAME  FACE, BECAUSE THIS IS "THE SPORT REPORT!" [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- THIS SUNDAY IS ALL ABOUT THE  BIG MATCHUP, TWO TITANS OF  THE GAME FINALLY GO HEAD TO  HEAD. I'M TALKING OF COURSE ABOUT  AXE BODY SPRAY VERSUS THE  E-TRADE BABY! [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE SUPERBOWL ADS ARE MY  FAVORITE PART OF THE GAME, AND  THIS YEAR THERE'S AN EXCITING NEW DEVELOPMENT.
TEASER ADS THAT TEASE YOU  TOWARD THE ADS IN THE BIG GAME. THIS IS NOW A BRAND NEW  PHENOMENON AND IT IS NO JOKE. THINK OF IT AS ADS FOR THE ADS
Stephen: YES, ADS FOR ADS. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS GREAT-- TiVO WATCHERS  HAVE SOMETHING TO PRACTICE  FAST-FORWARDING THROUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] AND ME? I LOVE 'EM! ESPECIALLY THIS TEASER FOR THE  AD FOR TACO BELL. ♪ ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] WOW, SEEING THAT OLD MAN GET  HURT REALLY MAKES ME CRAVE SOME  MEXICAN FOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] OR SOME TACO BELL. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, EVEN MERCEDES IS  GETTING IN ON THE AD-FOR-THE-AD  ACTION. ♪ ♪
YOU MISSED A SPOT. ♪ ♪
Stephen: OOOH, REALLY TARGETS  THEIR KEY DEMOGRAPHIC: [ LAUGHTER ] 14-YEAR-OLD BOYS MAKING 500,000  DOLLARS A YEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] MUST BE A LOT OF THEM OUT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SADLY THE GAME ITSELF IS  BEING MARRED BY ACCUSATIONS  ABOUT ONE OF THE STAR PLAYERS.
BALTIMORE RAVENS LINEBACKER,  RAY LEWIS, IS DENYING A SPORTS  ILLUSTRATED REPORT THAT CLAIMS THAT HE USED A BANNED SUBSTANCE  WHILE RECOVERING A TORN TRICEP  THIS SEASON. THE ARTICLE CLAIMS LEWIS WAS  GIVEN DEER ANTLER SPRAY TO SPEED  UP HIS RECOVERY.
IT COMES FROM THE VELVET OF  DEER ANTLERS.
DEER ANTLER SPRAY?
Stephen: YES, DEER ANTLER  SPRAY, WHICH OF COURSE, WAS  BANNED AFTER LANCE ARMSTRONG BECAME THE FIRST HOOVED WINNER  OF THE TOUR DE FRANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] I DID NOT KNOW THIS --  EVIDENTLY, DEER ANTLERS CONTAIN  "A HORMONE CALLED IGF1 THAT IS THOUGHT TO HELP MUSCLE  RECOVERY."  LEWIS HAS STRONGLY DENIED THESE  ACCUSATIONS, AND HAS SOME CHOICE WORDS ABOUT HIS ACCUSER.
THE GUY HAS NO CREDIBILITY. HE'S BEEN SUED FOUR TIMES OVER  THE SAME BS. DON'T LET PEOPLE FROM THE  OUTSIDE EVER COME AND TRY TO  DISTURB WHAT'S INSIDE. YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S THE TRICK  OF THE DEVIL. THE TRICK OF THE DEVIL IS TO  KILL, STEAL AND DESTROY. THAT's WHAT HE COMES TO DO. HE COMES TO DISTRACT YOU FOR  EVERYTHING YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.
Stephen: WELL SAID. BECAUSE THE BEST WAY TO PROVE  YOU'RE NOT ON DRUGS IS TO TALK  ABOUT HOW THE DEVIL IS TRYING TO MAKE YOU DO THINGS. [ LAUGHTER ] PERSONALLY, I THINK ALL THE  PLAYERS SHOULD TAKE THIS STUFF. THE NFL HAS A REAL HEAD-INJURY  PROBLEM, AND ANTLERS ARE  NATURE'S HELMET. [ LAUGHTER ] IN FACT, ALL FOOTBALL TEAMS  SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO TAKE  PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS, AS LONG AS THEY'RE EXTRACTED FROM  THEIR TEAM'S MASCOT. LET THE CHICAGO PLAYERS INJECT  BEAR BILE. [ LAUGHTER ] LET CINCINNATI SNORT TIGER DONG,  AND THE WASHINGTON -- WHOA. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FULL DISCLOSURE, THIS ISSUE  IS PERSONAL FOR ME. BECAUSE I TOO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED  BY MY RIVALS OF ABUSING  DEER ANTLER SPRAY. THEY WONDER HOW I CAN KEEP THIS  UP, NIGHT AFTER NIGHT,  WITHOUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT UP, MY JOB IS TO LOOK OUT  FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. FOR INSTANCE, I ALWAYS SCREAM  "CAR!" WHENEVER I'M ABOUT TO HIT  SOMEONE WITH MY CAR. [ LAUGHTER ] AND RIGHT NOW, I'VE GOT A  GAME DAY WARNING FOR YOU ABOUT  GATORADE.
GO TO YOUR FRIDGE, GRAB A  BOTTLE A GATORADE. LOOK AT THE INGREDIENTS. ONE NO LONGER IS THERE. THAT WOULD BE FLAME RETARDANT. YES, FLAME RETARDANT.
THE SUBSTANCE IS CALLED  BVO-- BROMINATED VEGETABLE OIL. IT KEEPS THE INGREDIENTS FROM  SEPARATING.
Stephen: FOLKS, THIS IS AN  OUTRAGE. THEY'RE MESSING WITH A CLASSIC  AMERICAN RECIPE. GATORADE WITHOUT BVO IS LIKE  HOTDOGS WITHOUT PIG SPHINCTER, [ LAUGHTER ] OR APPLE PIE WITHOUT APPLE  SPHINCTER. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, IT'S IN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK GOD GATORADE STILL HAS THE  REST OF IT'S ESSENTIAL  INGREDIENTS:  MONOPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, YELLOW DIE NUMBER FIVE, AND GLYCEROL  ESTER OF WOOD ROSIN. OH, "ESTER OF WOOD ROSIN": MY  FAVORITE NEW CHARACTER ON  "DOWNTON ABBEY." [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, I'M STILL GONNA BE  SERVING GATORADE AT MY SUPER  BOWL PARTY. AND, FOLKS, THERE IS NO SUPER  BOWL PARTY MORE ROCKIN' THAN THE  ANNUAL BASH AT CAPTAIN COLBERT'S GOODTIME HOUSE OF BALLS-OUT  KICKIN' IT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE WHOLE WRECKING CREW IS GONNA  BE THERE:  LOU DAWG,  SMALL-FACE TOMMY,  EDDIE PANTS-PLEATS, AND VINNIE THE DENTIST. [ LAUGHTER ] WE CALL HIM THAT BECAUSE HE'S A  DENTIST. I DO A BASEMENT TAILGATE. LET ME TELL YOU, AFTER THREE OR  FOUR BREEZIES AND 20 MINUTES  INDOORS WITH MY IDLING CHEVY TAHOE,  NO ONE WALKS OUT UNDER THEIR OWN  POWER. YOU HAVE TO LOVE PEOPLE THAT  APPLAUD BRAIN DAMAGE. LIKE NFL FANS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, PEOPLE COME FOR THE  SIGNATURE SNACKS, LIKE MY  WORLD-FAMOUS EIGHT MEAT CHILI. THIS YEAR I EVEN HAVE A  VEGETARIAN VERSION, WITH ONLY  SIX MEATS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE PARTY'S IN DANGER OF  MISSING OUT ON THE MAIN MEAT.
GUESS WHAT? SHORTAGE OF  CHICKEN WINGS.
YOUR SUPER BOWL CHICKEN WINGS  ARE GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE  THIS YEAR AND HARDER TO GET.
LAST YEAR'S SEVERE DROUGHT  LED TO FEWER CHICKENS AND  THEREFORE FEWER CHICKEN WINGS.
$2.52. THAT'S WHAT A POUND OF CHICKEN  WINGS WILL COST YOU THIS YEAR -  A RECORD FOR SUPER BOWL SUNDAY.
Stephen: $2.52 FOR A POUND OF  FOOD? WHERE ARE THEY RAISING THESE  CHICKENS? IN A PLACE WITH ACCESS TO LIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] UNTIL WE GET THIS WING SITUATION  UNDER CONTROL, I'M CALLING ON  SCIENCE TO DISCOVER WAYS TO BUFFALO OTHER NORMALLY DISCARDED  CHICKEN PARTS. I'M TALKING THE HEAD-SKIN, THE  BEAK LIPS, THE CANKLES. [ LAUGHTER ] 'CUZ, NO SURPRISE, WITH WING  PRICES FLYING HIGH AND REFUSING  TO DIP, THIEVES WITH STICKY FINGERS ARE RUNNING A-FOWL OF  THE LAW AND CREATING QUITE A  FLAP-- HONEY MUSTARD. [ LAUGHTER ] JIM?
POLICE HAVE ARRESTED TWO MEN  THAT ALLEGEDLY STOLE $65,000  WORTH OF CHICKEN WINGS FROM THE FROZEN FOOD DISTRIBUTION CENTER.
POLICE SAY THE MEN USED A  FORKLIFT TO LOAD TEN PALLETS OF  TYSON CHICKEN WINGS ON TO A RENTAL TRUCK.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THEY  PULLED OFF A $65,000 WING HEIST,  WHICH I BELIEVE IS ALSO THE PLOT OF "OCEAN'S 19." [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, THE THIEVES WERE  APPREHENDED AND CHARGED, BUT  THE WINGS WERE NEVER FOUND. [ LAUGHTER ] WHERE COULD THEY BE?! [ LAUGHTER ] POINT IS, IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE  FORTUNATE WHO MANAGED TO GET  SOME WINGS FOR THE SUPER BOWL, FOR GOD'S SAKE, BE SMART AND PUT  A PADLOCK ON THEM. OOOH-- BUFFALO PADLOCK. [ LAUGHTER ]
