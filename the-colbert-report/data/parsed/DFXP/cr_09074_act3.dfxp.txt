Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT WON A NOBEL  PRIZE AND MACARTHUR GRANT. BIG DEAL. I WAS ONLY FOUR NUMBERS AWAY  FROM HITTING THE POWERBALL. PLEASE WELCOME JUNOT DIAZ. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: SIT DOWN, MY  FRIEND. MAY I CALL YOU MY FRIEND. MI AMIGO?
EITHER ONE.
Stephen: FOR PEOPLE WHO  DON'T KNOW WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE  FIGURE YOU ARE YOU ARE A MACARTHUR GENIUSES, A NOBEL  PRIZE WINNER AND AUTHOR. CURRENTLY YOU ARE ON THE BOARD  OF ADVISORS AT SOMETHING CALLED  FREEDOM UNIVERSITY AND TEACH WRITING AT MIT?
YES.
Stephen: WRITING AT IMT --
I KNOW.
Stephen: ISN'T THAT LIKE  TEACHING ENGINEERING AT JULIARD. WHY?
I KNOW. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO LEARN WRITING  EVEN MIT.
Stephen: WHY. YOU HAVE SIRI NOW. YOU CAN DICTATE IT TO YOUR  IPHONE.
HAVE YOU TRIED IT. IT NEVER WORKS.
Stephen: I NEVER READ IT  BACK.
WRITING IS SO USEFUL.
Stephen: FREEDOM UNIVERSITY  IS A GEORGIA COLLEGE DEDICATED  TO EDUCATING UNDOCUMENTED  IMMIGRANTS.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: WHY?
IT'S ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS  WHERE WE HAD THE GEORGIA  LEGISLATURE DECIDED TO BAN FROM THE TOP FIVE SCHOOLS IN GEORGIA  STUDENTS FROM STUDYING THERE. IF UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH OR  STUDENTS WERE THERE, THEY ARE  NOT PERMITTED TO STUDY THEY WERE  CUT. EVEN PEOPLE WHO WERE ACCEPTED. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED  WAS A BUDGE THE OF PROFESSOR AND  YOUNG PEOPLE GOT TOGETHER SAID WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THIS LAW  TO CHANGE WE'RE GOING TO CREATE  THIS UNIVERSITY TO KEEP THE KIDS EDUCATED SO THEY CAN KEEP TAKING  CLASSES AND KEEP THEIR MINDS  GOING AND ALSO GET ACCESS TO THE EDUCATION WHICH THEY WANT.
Stephen: WHY SHOULD THEY  GET THIS EDUCATION? IT'S OUR EDUCATION? IT'S AMERICAN EDUCATION.
YES, WELL --
Stephen: THEY ARE TAKING  AMERICAN THOUGHTS AND IDEAS. THAT'S AMERICAN KNOWLEDGE.
EXCEPT, YOU KNOW --
Stephen: NO, I DON'T. [ LAUGHTER ]
HERE IS WHAT IT IS.
Stephen: OKAY.
THIS IS THE SITUATION, EVERY  SINGLE IMMIGRANT WE HAVE,  UNDOCUMENTED OR DOCUMENTED IS A FUTURE AMERICAN. THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH OF IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: NO, NO, IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
YES, IT IS.
Stephen: YOU ARE TALKING  ABOUT PATH TO CITIZENSHIP DO YOU  BELIEVE IN THAT?
DOESN'T THE WHOLE REPUBLICAN  PARTY BELIEVE IN IT NOW.
Stephen: NOT THE WHOLE  REPUBLICAN PARTY.
LEAVE TO LOSE ONE MORE  ELECTION.
Stephen: OR ONE WIN IF THEY  TURN OUT THE BASE. I BELIEVE IN THE GUEST WORKER  PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT  THING TO DO. LIKE A GUEST IN YOUR HOME YOU  CAN INVITE SOMEONE IN, WORK  UNTIL THEY DON'T NEED YOU AND SAY GET OUT. THEY HAVE NO SAY AS TO WHAT  HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE.
EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS  HAS TO ANSWER, WILL BE CALLED A  SUPERMAN QUESTION. SUPERMAN COMES, LANDS IN  AMERICA, HE IS ILLEGAL. HE IS ONE EVER THESE KIDS. HE IS WRAPPED UP IN A RED BULL  FIGHTER'S CAPE AND YOU HAVE TO  DECIDE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH SUPERMAN R. WE GOING TO  GIVE HIM THE BOOT AND SAY, YOU  KNOW WHAT? YOU ARE ILLEGAL NOT AN AMERICAN  OR HAVE COMPASSION SAYING THIS  KID WAS BROUGHT HERE -- BEFORE WE KNEW HE DIDN'T HAVE A SAY  WHETHER HE WAS GOING TO COME. HE IS LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY AND  EVEN AMERICAN.
Stephen: ON KRYPTON, DO  THEY SPEAK SPAN JISH?
THAT IS THE QUESTION.
Stephen: THIS IS FOR  UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS OR  ILLEGALS?
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY  ILLEGAL. I SAY UNDOCUMENTED.
Stephen: I SAY ILLEGAL. UNDOCUMENT COD BE LIKE A  CANADIAN GUY WHO LOST HIS  PASSPORT.
RIGHT. YOU CAN LOOK UP THE RULES AND  THE RULES THAT AN IMMIGRANT IS  SOMEONE BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY  LEGALLY. SO SAYING AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT  IS LIKE AN OXYMORON. IT'S A WEIRD ATTACK WORD. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT WE HAVE  TO DECIDE AS A COUNTRY WHAT  WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THE REALITY ON THE DWROWND. WE HAVE A BUNCH OF YOUNG PEOPLE  AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF FAMILIES. ARE WE GOING TO DISRUPT THESE  FAMILIES AND TEAR THEM APART OR  THINK, LIKE LISTEN, THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE. WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS  REALITY. WE HAVE TO EXTEND THE FRANCHISE. AND WE'VE GOT TO START THINKING  OF A COUNTRY IN A WAY OF HOW DO  WE PULL FOLKS TOGETHER NOT HOW DO WE ATTACK THEM AND AFFLICT  THEM? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: HERE IS WHY --  HERE IS WHY I THINK LETTING THEM  INTO OUR UNIVERSITIES IS UNFAIR. IS THAT THEY'VE GOT AN UNFAIR  ADVANTAGE OF UNDERSTANDING  AMERICA BECAUSE WHO IS GOING TO UNDERSTAND GREAT AMERICAN  LITERATURE LIKE THE GRAPES OF  WRATH BETTER THAN A MIGRANT  WORKER?
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHO UNDERSTANDS  WALT WHITMAN'S LEAFS OF GRASS  BETTER THAN THE GUY CUTTING MY  GRASS? WHO UNDERSTANDS THE PILGRIMS  BETTER THAN PEOPLE WHO CAME FOR  FREEDOM? IT'S AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. THEY HAVE TO BE GRADED ON A  CURVE.
OR THINK OF IT AS A HUGE  RESOURCE THAT ALL OF OUR  STUDENTS CAN TAP INTO. I THINK HAVING PEOPLE IN CLASS  WHO HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS, WHO  COME FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, DIFFERENT WORLDS  HELPS ALL OUR STUDENTS, I JUST  DO.
Stephen: WHERE DOES FREEDOM  UNIVERSITY MEET?
RIGHT NOW IT'S IN THE  UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA DOWN IN  ATHENS. YOU SHOULD COME DOWN. YOU SHOULD COME DOWN.
Stephen: I WOULD LOVE TO,  COLLEGE KIDS LOVE ME. DO YOU HAVE SWEATSHIRTS?
WE DON'T.
Stephen: LET ME HELP YOU  OUT WITH THAT? THERE YOU GO.
THERE THIS IS GREAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: I WANT YOU TO TAKE  THIS MESSAGE BACK WITH YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. JUNOT DIAZ FREEDOM
