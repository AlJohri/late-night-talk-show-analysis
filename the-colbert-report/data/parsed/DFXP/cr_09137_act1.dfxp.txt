Stephen: YES, WELCOME,  WELCOME, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO  MUCH.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO  MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU SO  MUCH. THANK YOU, WITH A GREETING  LIKE THAT, I COULD DO THIS  ALL NIGHT OR AT LEAST TWICE. OF LAUGH NATION, AMERICA IS  LOSING THE BATTLE AGAINST  MARY JANE. THIS YEAR NEW HAMPSHIRE AND  ILLINOIS LEGALIZED MEDICAL  MARIJUANA BRINGING THE TO 20 THE NUMBER OF STATES WHERE  YOUR PHARMACIST WILL SOON  LOOK LIKE THIS. (LAUGHTER)  THE DUDE PRESCRIBES. (LAUGHTER)  AND FOLKS, THE WAR ON NUGS  USED TO HAVE A STRONG ALLY  ON CNN'S DR. SANJAY GUPTA WHO OPPOSED LEGALIZING POT  UNTIL NOW.
I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT  IN 2009 YOU WROTE A "TIME"  MAGAZINE ARTICLE ENTITLED WHY I WOULD VOTE NO ON POT. YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.
I HAVE. AND AS PART OF, YOU KNOW, MY  THINKING, THE REASON, I HAVE  APOLOGIZED FOR SOME OF THE EARLIER REPORTING BECAUSE I  THINK, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN  TERRIBLY AND SYSTEMICALLY MISLEAD IN THIS COUNTRY FOR  SOME TIME. AND I DID PART OF THAT  MISLEADING.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND,  WE WERE MISINFORMED BY A  CABLE NEWS DOCTOR? (LAUGHTER)  NEXT YOU'LL TELL ME I CAN'T  GET DIRECTIONS TO MY  COUSIN'S HOUSE FROM FAREED ZAKARIA'S GPS. COME ON FAREED, LESS ON  SYRIA, MORE ON HOW I GET TO  WHERE GREG LIVES. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT IS AN  JAY GUPTA OR AS I NOW CALL  HIM GANJA SOUPTA, OKAY--  (LAUGHTER)  A GLOBAL, GLOBAL TEEN ICON  HAS GONE OVER TO THE DANK  SIDE. IT'S EVEN MORE DISTURBING,  FOLKS, ABOUT S SANJAY  FEELING THOSE GUPT  VIBRATIONS IS WE HAVE ALL SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HE  GETS THE MUNCHIES.
THIS IS STUD BULL PENIS,  THIS DEER PENIS, THESE ARE  LAMB TESTICLES, RUSSIAN DOG  PENIS. I WANTED TO ORDER SOME TIGER  PENIS. CAN I ORDER THAT HERE?
Stephen: REALLY? IS THAT REALLY WHO YOU WANT  TO BURN DOWN WITH, AMERICA? (LAUGHTER)  YEAH, SURE, YOU THOUGHT IT  WAS FUNNY WHEN YOUR FRIEND  SAID DUDE, LET'S GET THE DOG  HIGH. BUT HOW FUNNY WILL IT BE  WHEN HE SAYS DUDE, LET'S EAT  THE DOG'S PENIS. NOW WHO ARE THE KIDS GOING  TO LOOK UP TO AT CNN? WOLF BLITZER, YOU'RE OUR  ONLY HOPE. BUT AT LEAST, FOLKS, THERE  ARE SOME CELEBRITIES WE CAN  STILL LOOK UP TO THANKS TO STORIES LIKE THIS.
JOHN MALKOVICH USUALLY  NOT CAST AS A HERO BUT IS  BEING CREDITED WITH HELPING SAFE A MAN, REAL LIFE. THE ACKER HELPED A  77-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO TRIPPED  ON THE SIDEWALK AND THEN  SLASHED HIS THROAT ON SOME  SCAFFOLDING. WIDNESSES SAY THAT MALKOVICH  RAN OVER, APPLIED PRESSURE  TO THE MAN'S NECK AND WAITED FOR AN AMBULANCE.
Stephen: TRULY HEROIC. AND IT IS MALKOVICH SO  PROBABLY A LITTLE CREEPY. AND HE IS NOT HOLLYWOOD'S  ONLY HERO.
THERE WAS NO SPECIAL  EFFECTS. IT WAS THE REAL THING WHEN  ACTOR RYAN GOSLING CLUTCHED  A WOMAN FROM THE PATH OF A SPEEDING TAXIST WHEN A  17-YEAR-OLD FLIPPED HIS  MUSTANG T WAS PATRICK  DEMPSEY TO THE RESCUE PRYING THE BOY OUT.
DOES TIN HOFFMAN THE  LATEST HOLLYWOOD ACTOR TO  TURN HERO. REPORTING HOFFMAN SAVED A  JOGGER'S LIFE IN LONDON'S  HYDE PARK.
SHE WAS THE ONE IN  DISTRESS, BUT WHEN  BILLIONAIRE RICHARD  BRANSON'S CARIBBEAN ESTATE WENT UP IN FLAMES LAST  SUMMER T WAS WINSLET TO THE  RESCUE, VISITING SHE SWOOPED UP HIS 90-YEAR-OLD MOTHER  AND CARRIED HER TO SAFETY.
I'M SO GLAD BRANSON'S MOM  GOT OUT. HE WOULD HAVE CARRIED HER  HIMSELF BUT HIS BACK WAS  OCCUPIED. (LAUGHTER)  NOW FOLKS WITH ALL THESE  SUPER STAR SAVIOURS I'M  STARTING TO THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE PUTTING  THEMSELVES IN DANGER JUST TO  MEET CELEBRITIES. AND I WANT IN. NOW ENDANGERING MY OWN LIFE  SEEMS LIKE THE EASIEST WAY  TO DO IT. THAT IS JUST-- THE SIMPLEST  SOLUTION IS USUALLY TO SLICE  YOUR VEIN OPEN WITH A RAZOR AND HOPE TO GET CARRIED TO  THE HOSPITAL BY HUGH  JACKMAN. I LOVE YOU WOLVERINE. (APPLAUSE)  SO I GOT TO SAY W THAT IN  MIND COY SURE GO FOR SOME  SODA POP. I WILL BE RIGHT BACK, FOLKS. EXCUSE ME, RIGHT BACK, RIGHT  BACK. HELP, HELP, SOMEBODY FAMOUS.
DON'T WORRY, BOSS, I'LL  GET YOU OUT.
