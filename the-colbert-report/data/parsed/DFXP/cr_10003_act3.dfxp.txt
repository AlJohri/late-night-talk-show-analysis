( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK-- "TIP AND THE GIPPER: WHEN POLITICS WORKED." IT'S THE PERFECT THING FOR TED CRUZ TO READ DURING HIS NEXT FILIBUSTER. PLEASE WELCOME CHRIS MATTHEWS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  NICE TO SEE YOU. NICE TO HAVE A CHAMPION TALK OR THE SHOW. YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY THE HOST OF "HARDBALL." EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED "TIP AND THE GIPPER: WHEN POLITICS WORKED." OKAY. FIRST BONE TO PICK WITH YOU-- WHY-- WHY SHOULD POLITICS WORK? ( LAUGHTER ) AREN'T WE PROVING NOW IF WE MAKE IT NOT WORK WE CAN SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN.
BECAUSE WE STARTED THIS IN THE 18th CENTURY THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY GOVERN YOURSELF AND PEOPLE DISAGREED FROM DIFFERENT PART OF THE COUNTRY, RIGHT, LEFT, FEDERALISTS, AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT TO MAKE THE GOVERNMENT WORK. THAT WAS OUR BELIEF FROM THE BEGINNING.
Stephen:  GOT US IN TROUBLE. GOT US IN TROUBLE. WE'VE HAD A CIVIL WAR. WE'VE HAD A BUDGET DEFICIT. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT WORKS, THE GOVERNMENT GETS BIGGER.
NO, NO.
Stephen:  DO YOU BELIEVE-- YOU'RE CALLING IT THE SLIM-DOWN, TOO, AREN'T YOU?
NO. THE-- WHEN IT GETS TOGETHER AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY AGREE THEN THIST MOVES ON AND WE PROGRESS INTO THE NEXT CENTURY, AND WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT PERIOD OF OUR HISTORY. WE DON'T JUST KEEP FIGHTING OVER THE SAME OLD THINGS.
Stephen:  YOU'RE IMPLYING THERE HAS TO BE SOME COMPROMISE IN POLITICS.
YES, LIKE IN LIFE.
Stephen:  NO, SIR--
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A CONGRESS BECAUSE WE HAVE A VOTE AND IT IT HAS TO BE 218 IN THE HOUSE AND 60 IN THE SENATE AND THEN WE GO WITH THAT VOTE. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. IS THIS TOO COMPLICATED?
Stephen:  YES, I BELIEVE ON STANDING ON YOUR PRINCIPLES.
WHICH MEANS DON'T COMPROGRAM.
Stephen:  REAGAN NEVER DID.
HE DID SO! NOOSE THAT'S WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT.
Stephen:  HE DID NOT. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT. I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF "HARRY POTTER" FANTASY YOU'VE WRITTEN HERE. RONALD REAGAN STOOD ON HIS PRINCIPLES AND PUNCHED GOMP GOCH AND KNOCKED DOWN THE WALL.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN ARMS AGREEMENT --
Stephen:  THE SOAVES GOT RID OF THEIR ARMS. TAKE AWAY YOUR ARMS.
THEY GOT RID OF ALL THE ARMS IN EUROPE AS THE FIRST STEP AND THEN BEGAN WORKING ON THE INTERCONTINENTAL WEAPONS. THEY ENDED THE THREAT OF A THIRD WORLD WAR.
Stephen:  THEY KNEW REAGAN WAS WILLING TO PUSH THE BUTTON ON THE EVIL EMPIRE?
THEY DID.
Stephen:  THEY DID?
REAGAN HATED THE IDEA OF NUCLEAR WAR. THE ONLY REASON WE DIDN'T GO TO WAR IS ONE SIDE WOULD TOTALLY ANNIHILATE THE OTHER SIDE. HE SAID THE RUSSIANS ARE GOOD PEOPLE LIKE US. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THEY HAVE A LOUSY LEADERSHIP. HE UNDERSTOOD THE SITUATION.
GLU CAN HAVE YOUR AND KNOW I'LL HAVE MY OPINION AND I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.
SEE, I KEPT A BOOK --
Stephen:  IS THAT RECIPES? WHAT IS THAT?
NO, NO, NO. UNLIKE BILL O'REILLY WHO GETS IT FROM UP THERE, I KEPT NOTES.
Stephen:  REALLY. YOU'RE NOT ININSPIRED BY GOD TO WRITE A BOOK. BY THE WAY, WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL IT "KILLING TIP AND THE GIPPER."
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO HAVE THE BOOK WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR "KILLING O'REILLY?"
Stephen:  I'M NOT SAYING IT WOULDN'T ABE BIG SERL, BUT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE CRY FOR HELP. YOU WROTE THINGS DOWN.
I KEPT A DIARY THE WHOLE YEAR-- ALL THE TIMES WITH STIP TIPAND REAGAN.
Stephen:  DID YOU THINK YOU'D BE RESPOND AT SOME POINT.
NOT THEN. TODAY PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT. I KNEW I HAD TO KEEP MY RECORD.
Stephen:  YOU SAID THEY GOT ALONG IN SOME WAY.
WHEN I FIRST MET REAGAN I SAID WELCOME TO THE ROOM WHERE WE PLOT AGAINST YOU, UP AT THE CAPITOL, TO BREAK THE ILIKE YOU DO-- AND HE SAID NOT AFTER SIX.
THE SPEAKER SAID FRIENDS AFTER 6:00.
Stephen:  WHAT ABOUT THE THINGS TIP SAYS-- HE SAYS REAGAN HAS NO CONCERN, NO REGARD, NO CARE FOR THE LITTLE MAN. HE'S A REAL EBENEZER SCROOGE WHOSE WHOSE PROGRAMS ARE FOR THE SELFISH, GREEDY, AND THE AFFLUENT. HE SAID THE REAL PROBLEM IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE -- HOUSE--
I THINK I MAY HAVE WRITTEN THAT ONE. WHAT REAGAN ALSO SAID IS AT THE ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARTY. HE WROTE IN THE DIREEE IT'S ON THE RECORD-- HE WOULD WRITE TIP IS A REAL POL. HE CAN REALLY LIKE AND YOU BE YOUR FRIEND AND THEN TRY TO KNOCK YOUR BLOCK OFF. RON REAGAN, HIS SON, TOLD ME WHEN HE CAME HOME AT NIGHT HE SAID HOW FOUND HE WAS OF TIP.
Stephen:  IF REAGAN WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE NOW DO YOU THINK WE WOULD BE AT THE IMPASSE?
NO, BECAUSE HE HAD A STRENGTH OTHERS DIDN'T HAVE. HE CAN SCARE THE HELL OUT OF --
Stephen:  ARE YOU SAYING OBAMA DOESN'T CARE PEOPLE? WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH TO MAKE PEOPLE AFRAID OF OBAMA?
IT'S BETTER TO BE FEARED THAN LOAFED. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THESE GUYS FROM RIGHT WING DISTRICTS ARE NOT AFRAID OF THEM. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IS GOING TO GO ON FOR WEEKS.
Stephen:  YOU THINK REAGAN WAS A BETTER PRESIDENT THAN OBAMA IS?
IN THE END, YEAH. IN THE END.
Stephen:  DO YOU THINK REAGAN--
BECAUSE HE ENDED THE COLD WAR. THAT'S HARD TO MEET BEET. HARD TO BEAT THAT BABY.
Stephen:  HOW DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO END, THE SHOWDOWN. THE SLIM-DOWN?
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE DEFAULT COME THE 24th. WHAT HAPPENS ON THE 24th OF THIS MONTH? INSTEAD OF SENDING OUT THE INTEREST TO THE CHINESE BILLIONAIRES WE'VE BEEN BORROWING MONEY FROM, ALL OF A SUDDEN FOR THE THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY WE DON'T PAY OUR INTEREST. THINK OF AN AIRLINE. WOULD YOU GET ON AN AIRLINE THAT SAID 95% SAFETY RECORD? OR WOULD YOU LOOK FAIR AN AIRLINE THAT HAD 100% SAFETY RECORD. FOR YEARS, THE WORLD HAS LOOKED AT THE NIEWTS YOOUTS AND SAID THEY HAVE 100% SAFETY. WE WILL NOT BE THE STORE OF VALUE. WE WILL NOT BE ANYTHING. WE WILL BE THE COUNTRY THAT BECAME A DEAD-BEAT COUNTRY IN OCTOBER OF 2013. AND THAT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME. AND THAT COULD HAPPEN BY THE END OF THIS MONTH BECAUSE THESE RIGHT WING JACKALS. AM I CLEAR? ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  CHRIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. CHRIS MATTHEWS, AND CHRIS MATH USE. "TIP AND THE GIPPER: WHEN POLITICS WORKED." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS
