( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOW, FOLKS I GOTTA TELL YOU, ONE  OF THE THINGS THAT HAS GOTTEN ME  DEBLESSED ABOUT OBAMA'S RIDICULOUS REELECTION WAS THAT  SPEECH HE GAVE LAST NIGHT ON  EVIDENTLY NAIROBI TIME LAYING OUT HIS PRIORITIES FOR THE NEXT  TERM.
WE WANT OUR CHILDREN TO LIVE  IN AN AMERICA THAT ISN'T  BURDENED BY DEBT, ISN'T WEAKENED BY INEQUALITY, THAT ISN'T  THREATENED BY THE DESTRUCTIVE  POWER OF A WARMING PLANET.
Stephen:  YOU HEAR THAT? WARMING PLANET. THAT'S GLOBAL WARMING  ( LAUGHTER )  WHETHER WE WANT HIS IEFLT  ENERGIES OR NOT, HE IS GOING TO BEND AMERICA OVER AND STICK  SOLAR POWER WHERE THE SUN DON'T  SHINE. ( LAUGHTER )  BUT AS I SUSPECTED, FOLKS,  ALTERNATIVE ENERGY COME WITH  RISKS.
AT FIRST, ERNIE MARSHALL WAS  ALL FOR THE NEW WIND FARM GOING  UP NEAR HIS HOME
AND IT SOUND LIKE A GREAT  IDEA.
BUT SOON AFTER THE TURBINES  STARTED ROLLING, HE SAID HE  STARTED SUFFERING A LITANY OF HEALTH COMPLAINTS.
I'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY  HEART. I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MY EARS. IT TRAUMATIZES YOUR WHOLE BODY.
Stephen:  YES, LIVING NEAR  A WINDMILL CAN RUIN YOUR HEALTH. THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY IN THE  NIGHTER LAND IS ALWAYS SPARKING  UP THEIR MEDICAL MARIJUANA. NOW, FOLKS THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM  WHAT'S BECOME KNOWN AS WIND  TURBINE SYNDROME SAY IT'S CAUSED BY THE NOISE, VIBRATIONS, AND  MOVING SHADOWS OF THE TURNING  BLADE. AND I'VE HEARD THE SAME  COMPLAINT ABOUT THE GILLETTE  FUSION POWER PHANTOM RAZOR. A STUDY BY THE UNIVERSITY OF  SYDNEY FOUND 150 HEALTH PROBLEMS  ATTRIBUTED TO WIND TURBINES INCLUDING MIGRAINE, SLEEP LOSS,  STOMACH PROBLEMS, VERTIGO,  WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT LOSS, HAIR TURNING GRAY, TYPE 1 DIABETES,  AND HERPES. YES, HERPES. AS IN, "NO, BABY, I DIDN'T CHEAT  ON YOU. OF IT THE WINDMILL. IT USED MY TOILET SEAT."  ( APPLAUSE )  LAUGH WHICH OF COURSE, WHICH OF  COURSE BEGS THE QUESTION:  WHO'S BEEN ( BLEEP ) OUR WINDMILLS? ( LAUGHTER )  NOW, WIND TURBINE SYNDROME--  ( LAUGHTER )  -- MIGHT JUST SEEM LIKE A COLLECTION OF UNRELATED HEALTH  COMPLAINT TO THE UNTRAINED EYE--  BY THE WAY "UNTRAINED EYE "ALSO A SYMPTOM OF WIND TURBINE  SYNDROME. THE RELATIONSHIP IS SEEMS THAT  WAY IS BECAUSE IT PROBABLY IS. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED  THERE ARE NO EVIDENCE OFFING  HEALTH EFFECTS FROM WIND  TURBINES. BUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S MADE UP  DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT  CONTABLOUS. WIND TURBINE SYNDROME IS WHAT WE  CAN CALL A COMMUNICATED DISEASE. IT SPREADS VIA THE NOCEBO EFFECT  BY BEING TALKED. OKAY? FOLLOW ME HERE. THE THE NOCEBO EFFECT IS A  NEGATIVE PLACEBO EFFECT. IT'S WHY I HAD MY DOCTOR TAKE ME  OFF MY PLACEBOS. THEY KEPT CURING MY  HYPOCHONDRIA. THE POINT IS, YOU CAN GET-- YOU  CAN GET WIND TURBINE SYNDROME  JUST BY HEARING SOMEONE TALK ABOUT IT. LIKE I'M DOING NOW. ( LAUGHTER )  AND BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY  EXIST, IT STANDS TO REASON, YOU  COULD CATCH IT FROM ANY GREEN TECHNOL I DON'T APPROVE OF. FOR EXAMPLE, DO YOU LIVE NEAR A  SOLAR PANEL? OR DO YOU OWN A SOLAR POWERED  CALCULATOR? AND HAVE YOU HAD ANY OF THESE  SYMPTOMS-- HEADACHE, NAUSEA,  LACK OF NAUSEA, FORGETTING WHERE YOU PUT YOUR KEYS OR PROBLEMS  BREATHING UNDER WATER? ( LAUGHTER )  WELL, SOUND LIKE YOU'VE GOT A  BAD CASE OF SOLAR PANEL  SYNDROME. THE POINT IS, OBAMA'S GOING TO  KILL US ALL. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  SO WE SHOULD ALL JUST KEEP  BURNING FOSSIL FUELS. THAT WAY THE PROBLEM WON'T BE  ALL IN YOUR HEAD. IT WILL BE SPREAD EVENLY  THROUGHOUT YOUR LUNGS. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
