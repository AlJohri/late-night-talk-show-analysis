[EAGLE CAW]
Stephen: TONIGHT, OBAMA  FIGHTS CLIMATE CHANGE EVEN  THOUGH CHANGE WAS HIS CAMPAIGN  SLOGAN. FLIP FLOP! [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, TENSIONS RISE IN NORTH  KOREA. NOT ABOVE 5'5", BUT YOU KNOW-- [ LAUGHTER ] AND MY GUEST, MICHAEL  SHELLENBERGER, IS AN  ENVIRONMENTALIST WHO BELIEVES IN  NUCLEAR ENERGY. FINALLY, LIBERALS THAT GLOW IN  THE DARK. [ LAUGHTER ] AXE BODY SPRAY HAS ANNOUNCED A  CONTEST THAT WILL SEND THE  WINNER TO SPACE. STILL NOT FAR ENOUGH TO GET AWAY  FROM THE SMELL. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME! BOOM! BOOM! WOO! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
Stephen: YES! YES! YES! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ABSOLUTELY. WELCOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YES, PLEASE. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME BACK. PLEASE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THOSE  BASTARDS HAVE HAD A FREE RIDE  LONG ENOUGH. IT ENDS TONIGHT. NATION, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SECOND  TERM IS ONLY A WEEK OLD, AND  ALREADY WE ARE ONE WEEK CLOSER TO DYING. WELCOME TO OBAMACARE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE PRESIDENT IS DROPPING  THE BALL ON HOMELAND SECURITY.
THE TSA IS REMOVING THE BODY  SCANNERS THAT PRODUCE A NAKED  IMAGE OF THE PASSENGERS BODIES. YOU REMEMBER THOSE? THEY'RE BEING REMOVED BC THE  COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURES THEM  COULDN'T MEET A DEADLINE TO INSTALL THE PRIVACY SOFTWARE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE REPLACED  WITH OTHER SCANNERS THAT PRODUCE  A GENERIC OUTLINE OF THE PASSENGER'S BODY.
Stephen: A GENERIC OUTLINE OF  THE BODY? [ LAUGHTER ] HOW CAN I LEGALLY SHOW THE TSA  MY PENIS NOW? [ LAUGHTER ] I USED TO WRITE THEM LITTLE  MESSAGES IN LEAD-BASED PAINT. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE "GOOD MORNING" OR "ALL  EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, I DO  "NOT" WISH TO HAVE A KOSHER MEAL." [ LAUGHTER ] OR ON A PARTICULAR CHILLY DAY,  "HI." [ LAUGHTER ] THE TSA'S JUST CAVING TO  PRESSURE BECAUSE THE SCANNERS  WERE CRITICIZED FOR BEING TOO  INVASIVE. OH, PLEASE! WHAT IS INVASIVE ABOUT A  TECHNOLOGY CALLED, AND I THINK  I'M PRONOUNCING THIS CORRECTLY  RAPE-I-SCAN? [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS A MISTAKE, NATION. NOW, WE'LL NEVER COMPLETE OUR  NATIONAL DATABASE OF RADICAL  ISLAMIC NAUGHTY PARTS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'D ALREADY ESTABLISHED A  PROFILE,  YOUNG AND LEANING TO THE RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] PLUS, IT WAS A DETERRENT. TERRORISTS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR  MODESTY. THAT'S WHY KHALID SHEIKH  MUHAMMAD WAS WEARING A T-SHIRT  OVER THAT SWEATER. [ LAUGHTER ] FASHION FANS HERE. LAUGH  THE WORST PART IS, WITHOUT THESE  SCANNERS, I HAVE NO REASON TO  LAUGH  STAY IN SHAPE ANY MORE. [ LAUGHTER ] SURE, EXERCISE WILL MAKE ME LOOK  BETTER, FEEL BETTER, BE MORE  ATTRACTIVE, BUT IF A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE GETTING PAID TEN BUCKS  AN HOUR DOESN'T SEE HOW I'VE  SHAVED INCHES OFF MY MUFFIN TOP, WHY EVEN FLY ANYMORE? [ LAUGHTER ] I MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THE BUS,  WHERE YOU DON'T NEED SOME FANCY  SCANNER TO FLASH PEOPLE YOUR  JUNK. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT  A MAN NAMED MICHAEL  SHELLENBERGER. HE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL  STRATEGIST WHO BELIEVES THAT WE  NEED NEW THINKING WHEN IT COMES TO THE BATTLE AGAINST GLOBAL  WARMING.  I AGREE. MY OLD THINKING WAS "WHAT GLOBAL  WARMING?" [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, I BEGAN TO BELIEVE IN  GLOBAL WARMING AFTER AL GORE'S  MOVIE MADE MONEY. [ LAUGHTER ] THE MARKET HAD SPOKEN. IT'S THE SAME REASON I BELIEVE  OUR CHILDREN ARE FIGHTING TO THE  DEATH IN CAPITOL CITY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE EVIDENCE IS GROWING. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN AUSTRALIA,  WHICH WAS JUST SIMULTANEOUSLY  BATTERED BY TYPHOONS, WILDFIRES, AND RECORD HEAT. AND THAT'S IN JANUARY. IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE THERE IN  THE SUMMER. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- AUSTRALIA DIDN'T TAKE THIS  LYING DOWN. THEY STRUCK BACK WITH NEW  TECHNOLOGIES.
WE KNOW GLOBAL WARMING HAS  CREATED SUCH EXTREME WEATHER IN  AUSTRALIA, THE COUNTRY'S BUREAU OF METEOROLOGY HAS ADDED TWO NEW  COLORS TO THE COUNTRY'S WEATHER  MAPS, AN INCANDESCENT PURPLE AND MAGENTA, SO THE MAPS CAN  FAITHFULLY REPRESENT  TEMPERATURES LIKE 125 DEGREES  FAHRENHEIT.
Stephen: YES, NEW MAP COLORS. I BELIEVE THE TEMPERATURE COLOR  WHEEL GOES ORANGE, RED, PURPLE,  MAGENTA, FEVER BLISTER, AND SATAN'S TAINT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT WHAT'S REALLY DISTURBING  ABOUT THIS CONTINENT ON FIRE IS  THAT IT'S GOT PEOPLE WANTING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT GLOBAL  WARMING. AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S  WORD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE NEW ABNORMAL. LAST WEEK, PRESIDENT OBAMA  CYNICALLY USED THE INAUGURAL  ADDRESS TO PUSH HIS RADICAL PRO-SURVIVAL AGENDA.
WE WILL RESPOND TO THE THREAT  OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE PATH TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE  ENERGY SOURCES WILL BE LONG AND  SOMETIMES DIFFICULT, BUT AMERICA CANNOT RESIST THIS TRANSITION.
Stephen: I DIDN'T THINK  THIS PART OF HIS SPEECH WOULD  GET ANY TRACTION. IT'S LIKE IF JFK ANNOUNCED THE  APOLLO PROGRAM BUT HALF THE  COUNTRY DENIED THE MOON EXISTS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I SAW A  NEW POLL THAT FOUND 78% OF  RESPONDENTS BELIEVED THE PLANET HAD WARMED OVER THE PAST 100  YEARS. THE OTHER 22% BURST INTO FLAMES [ LAUGHTER ] EVEN KOCH BROTHERS-FUNDED  BELIEVE THAT INDIA IS OUT THERE  SCRUBBING THEIR COAL TO MAKE IT NICE AND CLEAN?
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO MUCH  ABOUT IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO  DE-INDUSTRIALIZE CHINA AND INDIA AND ALL THESE DEVELOPING  COUNTRIES. WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: THANKS, FOR  LITERALLY NOTHING, GUYS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT AS LITTLE AS THAT ATTITUDE  HELPS, PERHAPS NO ONE OFFERS  MORE NOTHING THAN CNN CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR AND  INERTIAL LUMP ERICK ERICKSON. [ LAUGHTER ]
REALLY THE BIGGEST PROBLEM  IS, WHAT DOES IT MATTER? WE COULD SHUT DOWN PRODUCTION OF  EVERYTHING TOMORROW THAT CAUSES  GREENHOUSE GASES AND CHINA AND INDIA AREN'T. AND EVEN IF EVERYONE DID, THE  EFFECTS WOULDN'T TAKE EFFECT  'TIL A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW.
Stephen: YEAH, WHAT'S THE  POINT OF GOING TO ALL THAT  TROUBLE, IF ME AND ERICK ERICKSON WON'T BE AROUND TO  ENJOY IT? [ LAUGHTER ] SURE, OUR GRANDKIDS WILL, BUT I  DON'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE  GRANDPAS WHO SPOILS HIS GRANDKIDS WITH A HABITABLE  PLANET. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S THE SAME REASON I WON'T BUY  LIFE INSURANCE. I GET HIT BY A BUS AND MY FAMILY  GETS RICH? SORRY, BUT I DON'T WANT ANYBODY  HAPPY AT MY FUNERAL. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THAT WASN'T ERICKSON'S ONLY  NON-SOLUTION. HE DUG DOWN DEEP AND HELPED EVEN  LESS.
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A PROBLEM  WE PROBABLY HAVE TO GET USED TO  AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING WE CAN  CURE.
Stephen: YES, WE JUST NEED TO  GET USED TO IT. ERICKSON HAS FINALLY HIT THE  FIFTH STAGE OF CONSERVATIVE  CLIMATE CHANGE GRIEF:  DENIAL, DENIAL, DENIAL, DENIAL, AND ACCEPTANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, SURE, AMERICA BEAT TOJO; WE  CRUSHED HITLER; WE PUT A MAN ON  THE MOON, BUT INCREMENTALLY REDUCING Co2 EMISSIONS? THAT SOUNDS LIKE WORK. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW CAN WE FIGHT AN ENEMY WE  CAN'T EVEN SEE?! GET OUT OF HERE! GET OUT OF HERE! DID I HIT IT? I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, IT'S HIGH TIME WE STOP  TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND  RESIGN OURSELVES TO EACH DAY GETTING WORSE. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE WHEN ERICK ERICKSON  SAYS, "GET USED IT," HE MEANS  CITY-SWALLOWING STORMS, MASS EXTINCTIONS, DEADLY HEATWAVES,  CRIPPLING FLOODS, AND DROUGHTS  THAT MAKE A DESERT OUT OF  OKLAHOMA. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS NOW. OUR PROBLEMS ARE JUST TOO BIG TO  CURE. SO JOIN ME AND ERICK. GIVE UP, CRAWL INTO BED WITH A  CHEESECAKE AND WAIT FOR DEATH. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW SURE, THE ONLY THING WORSE  THAN GLOBAL WARMING ITSELF MIGHT  BE KNOWING YOU'RE DESTROYING THE PLANET AND DOING NOTHING, BUT IF  GUYS LIKE ERICK HAVE THEIR WAY,  YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLA
