Stephen: TONIGHT, WILL  CONGRESS APPROVE TAKING ACTION  IN SYRIA? FIRST THEY HAVE TO APPROVE  TAKING ACTION IN CONGRESS. (LAUGHTER)  THEN, COULD NEW TECHNOLOGY BRING  US ROBOTIC COMPANIONS? I HOPE SO, BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF  BRING MIG TOASTER AS A PLUS ONE. (LAUGHTER)  AND MY GUEST, GARY ENGLAND, IS A  METEOROLOGIST FROM OKLAHOMA. HE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW FAST THE  ♪ WIND COMES SWEEPING DOWN THE  PLAINS ♪  (LAUGHTER) HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO GOOGLE WHICH  TURNS 15 TODAY. JUST THREE MORE YEARS AND THEY  CAN TURN THE SAFE SEARCH OFF. (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"  EVERYBODY OUT THERE, IN HERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US,  FOLKS. YOU ASKED THESE PEOPLE, THEY  KNOW, I'VE GOT A BUG UP MY ASS. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PLACE. (LAUGHTER)  I'LL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN WARNING  YOU FOR YEARS -- HERE'S WHAT  IT'S ABOUT. I'VE BEEN WARNING YOU FOR YEARS  THAT BARACK OBAMA IS A WEAK  LEADER AND HE HAS PROVEN ME RIGHT ONCE AGAIN. DAMN MY GIFT! (LAUGHTER)  THE MAN COULD NOT LEAD US ON  HEALTH CARE REFORM. HE COULD NOT LEAD US ON THE  BUDGET TALKS. AND NOW HE CAN NOT LEAD US INTO  WAR. SPECIFICALLY WITH SYRIA! WHERE DICTATOR AND HIGH SCHOOL  FRESHMAN TRYING TO GROW A  MUSTACHE BASHAR AL-ASSAD --  (LAUGHTER). -- HAS USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS  AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE. NOW, AS THE WORLD'S POLICEMAN,  AMERICA HAS A MORAL IMPERATIVE  TO BLOW SOME (BLEEP) UP! (LAUGHTER)  BUT THANKS TO OBAMA'S LIMP  LEADERSHIP, THAT IDEA IS GOING  OVER LIKE A TURD FALAFEL. ONLY 29% OF AMERICANS WANT US TO  ATTACK SYRIA. NOW, ON THE PLUS SIDE, THAT  MEANS 29% OF AMERICANS KNOW  THERE IS A PLACE CALLED SYRIA. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH, FOLKS. IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF HOW OBAMA IS  SELLING IT!
I HAVE DECIDED THAT THE  UNITED STATES SHOULD TAKE  MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SYRIAN REGIME TARGETS. THIS WOULD NOT BE AN OPEN-ENDED  INTERVENTION. WE WOULD NOT PUT BOOTS ON THE  GROUND. INSTEAD, OUR ACTION WOULD BE  DESIGNED TO BE LIMITED IN  DURATION AND SCOPE. OUR CAPACITY TO EXECUTE THIS  MISSION IS NOT TIME SENSITIVE. IT WILL BE EFFECTIVE TOMORROW OR  NEXT WEEK OR ONE MONTH FROM NOW. I I TRANSLATION, WE DON'T KNOW  WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, WE WON'T  DO MUCH AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHEN WE DO IT. WHO'S WITH ME? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO  GET BEHIND THAT? I'VE GOT A CRACK GRAPHICS  DEPARTMENT UPSTAIRS READY TO  MAKE A SIZZLING TITLE SEQUENCE LIKE "AMERICA AT WAR!"  OR "DESERT STORM" OR "SHOW DOWN  IN THE GULF."  BUT THANKS TO OBAMA, THIS IS THE BEST THEY COULD DO!
CRISIS SYRIA. (PLAYING "PRICE IS RIGHT LOSER  THEME). (LAUGHTER)  WHERE'S THE EXCITEMENT, OBAMA? WHERE THE ZAZZ? COME ON YOU PUSSSY, SLAP SOME  ANDROGEL ON AND GROW A PAIR! YOU'RE THE GODDAMNED  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA! I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SET A  RED LINE!
I DIDN'T SET A RED LINE. (LAUGHTER)  THE WORLD SET A RED LINE.
THE WORLD? WHO CARES ABOUT THE WORLD? WE'RE AMERICA! IF WE CARED ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD  IS WE'D EAT FLAN AND WATCH  SOCCER. (LAUGHTER)  OH, I'M SORRY, FUTBALL. (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS? I MISS GEORGE W. BUSH. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  THAT MAN -- YEAH, I CAN TELL YOU  MISS HIM, TOO. (LAUGHTER)  THAT MANU HOW TO SELL A WAR. OBAMA HAS HARD EVIDENCE OF  WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND  HE CAN'T EVEN GET ENGLAND TO GO ALONG WITH IT. MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT BUSH GOTTEN  A INTERNATIONAL COALITION WITH  NOTHING MORE THAN COLIN POWELL'S REPUTATION AND HALF A TEST TUBE  OF CRYSTAL LIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME WAR  MARKETING? BUSH HAD US HANGING ON EVERY  WORD BECAUSE BY THE NEXT WORD HE  MIGHT ALL BE DEAD. (LAUGHTER)  JIM?
SADDAM HUSSEIN IS A HOMICIDAL  DICTATOR WHO IS ADDICTED TO  WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. ING A SEUSZ OF EVIL. 50 TONS OF MUSTARD GAS AND A  TURKEY FARM. MOBILE BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS LABS. SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF  URANIUM. THE REGIME SEEKING A NUCLEAR  BOMB. THE SMOKING GUN. IT COULD COME IN THE FORM OF A  MUSHROOM CLOUD.
GOD I LOVE BEING LIED TO BY A  PROFESSIONAL! (LAUGHTER)  YOU CAN FEEL THE HAND  CRAFTSMANSHIP SO PRESIDENT  OBAMA, YOU COULD LEARN A THING OR TWO ABOUT SALESMANSHIP FROM  THIS GOOD MAN! STOP ASKING OUR PERMISSION AND  START TELLING US OUR PEREL, LIKE  THIS: MY FELLOW AMERICANS, BASHAR AL-ASSAD HAS USED POISON  GAS ON HIS OWN PEOPLE. IF WE DO NOT RESPOND SOURCES SAY  NEXT HE WILL HIT EPCOT THEREBY  TAKING OUT PARIS, LONDON, AND CHINA AND IT FLOWS OVER TO  DISNEY, THAT'S ALL OF OUR  ROBOTIC PRESIDENTS. (LAUGHTER)  FURTHER MORE, WE HAVE SATELLITE  PHOTOS OF HIM PUNCHING YOUR  MOTHER AND SODOMIZING A  BASEBALL! AND HE HAS PURCHASED URANIUM  FROM HITLER'S GHOST. (LAUGHTER)  IT IS OUR MORAL OBLIGATION TO  STOP THIS MADMAN AND IF BRITAIN  WON'T HELP US, I SAY (BLEEP) 'EM, FROM NOW ON ENGLISH MUFFINS  WILL BE CALLED LIBERTY TOAST  BECAUSE AMERICA -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  -- AMERICA, THIS LAND IS MY LAND  AND YOUR LAND AND AMERICA DOES NOT BACK DOWN ON THE FACE OF  TYRANNY. FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU. FOOL ME TWICE A PENNY SAVE SAD  HORSE TO WATER WHOSE COLORS DO  NOT RUN! MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA! WANGO TANGO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BOTTOM LINE, WILL BARACK OBAMA  STACK UP AND START SPELLING THIS WAR RIGHT? ONLY TIME WILL TELL AND SO WILL  MY GUEST. PLEASE WELCOME PULITZER PRIZE  WINNING WRITER FOR THE "NEW  YORKER" AND DEAN OF THE COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM STEVE COLL,  STEVE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. STEVE, YOU GOTTEN A ARTICLE IN  THE NEW NEW YORKER HERE CALLED  "CROSSING THE LINE" RIGHT? STEVE, HELP ME OUT WITH  SOMETHING HERE. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS BUT  I'M NOT SURE IF I WANT AMERICA  TO GET INTO ANOTHER WAR WITH THE MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRY WITH NO  CLEAR OBJECTIVE. AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS UGLY TO  SAY. WHY DON'T I WANT TO FOLLOW  BARACK OBAMA INTO BATTLE. WHERE DO YOU THINK HE'S SCREWING  THE POOCH?
WELL, THE WEIGHT OF THE LAST  TWO WARS THAT HE INHERITED, THE  4,500 DEAD IN IRAQ FOR A WAR FOUGHT IN THE NAME OF WEAPONS OF  MASS DESTRUCTION THAT DIDN'T  EXIST.
Stephen: WHY DIDN'T HE BOMB  THEM AND SAY "HEY, I JUST SAVED  A BUNCH OF KIDS IN SYRIA, YOU PEOPLE CAN HAVE YOUR ACADEMIC  DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER I  SHOULD HAVE DONE IT"?
THE PROBLEM IS HE'S FIGHTING  ABOUT A WAR WITH A GLOBAL IDEA.
Stephen: IF IT'S A SERIOUS  MATTER, WHY ISN'T THE PRESIDENT  PUSHING IT HARDER?
I THINK HE IS CAUTIONED BY  AMERICANS' EXPERIENCE IN THE  LAST TWO WARS, HE RECOGNIZES THAT HE'S GOING TO WAR WITHOUT A  CLEAR OBJECTIVE, A VICTORY, IS A  HARD DECISION TO TAKE.
Stephen: WELL, LET'S TALK  ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE OF THE WAR,  WHAT WILL THE OBJECTIVE OF THE WAR BE? (LAUGHTER)
IT IS AN UNUSUAL PROPOSITION  TO FIGHT A WAR TO PREVENT A  CERTAIN WEAPON FROM BEING USED.
Stephen: BECAUSE THEY ASKED  KERRY IN CONGRESS AND THEY SAID  ARE WE GOING TO FIGHT THIS TO WIN IT AND HE GOES "NO, WE DON'T  WANT TO WIN."
THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION IS  HE DOESN'T WANT TO OVERTHROW THE  ASSAD REGIME.
Stephen: WHY NOT KNOCK HIM  OUT AND GET THOSE REBELS IN  THERE? DON'T WE STAND WITH THE REBELS?
WE DO STAND WITH THE REBELS. WE ARE SUPPLYING THEM ARMS,  APPARENTLY, ACCORDING TO THE  WHITE HOUSE, AND WE DO SUPPORT A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT THAT WOULD  INCLUDE ASSAD'S DEPARTURE FROM  POWER. BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING TO  SAY WE'RE ALL IN, BOOTS ON THE  GROUND, WHATEVER IT TAKES TO FORCE ASSAD FROM POWER BECAUSE  THAT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY A  LONG, COSTLY, AND DESTABLE AOEUING WAR. I SIX THIS A MESSAGE TO IRAN? BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SAYING  STRIKING SYRIA IS ACTUALLY A  MESSAGE TO IRAN.
I'VE HEARD THE WHITE HOUSE  MAKE THAT ARGUMENT BUT, YOU  KNOW, IRAN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CASE IN ITS NUCLEAR  AMBITIONS. I DON'T THINK A DIRECT PARALLEL  BETWEEN THE WAR IN SYRIA AND THE  WAR IN IRAN --
Stephen: DOES IT SEND A  MESSAGE TO ANYBODY?
IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO ASSAD,  DO YOU WANT TO USE CHEMICAL  WEAPONS AGAIN AND RISK THIS KIND OF AERIAL AND OTHER MISSILE  RETALIATION THAT WILL DEGRADE  YOUR AIR FORCE, WIPE OUT YOUR ARTILLERY, DECAPITATE YOUR  INTELLIGENCE LEADERS AND  WHATEVER THE OTHER OBJECTIVES OF THE WAR PLAN.
Stephen: BUT NOT KILL  ASSAD, RIGHT?
APPARENTLY NOT KILL ASSAD.
Stephen: AND NOT TAKE HIM  OUT OF POWER?
IT IS THE EXPLICIT STATEMENT  OF THE PRESIDENT THAT HE'S NOT  TRYING TO WIN THE CIVIL WAR THROUGH AIR POWER. BUT THAT HE IS TRYING TO MAKE  SURE THAT CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE  NOT USED AGAIN AGAINST THE SYRIAN PEOPLE FOR THE PURPOSE --
Stephen: WHAT IF HE JUST  USES THEM AGAIN?
I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE  QUESTION.
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU,  I'M A REASONABLE MAN. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT IF HE SAYS "HEY, YOU  KNOCKED OUT PEOPLE, I'M NOT  DEAD, I'VE PROVEN I DON'T CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE BY USING  CHEMICAL WEAPONS, I'LL USE THEM  AGAIN. NANNY NANNY BOO-BOO."  YOU'LL PARDON MY ARABIC. (LAUGHTER)
A PROBLEM WITH DEFINING A WAR  AROUND SOMETHING AS NARROW AS  CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE IS THAT IT DOES GIVE ASSAD THE SPACE TO  DECIDE THAT HE WANTS TO USE THEM  AGAIN TO DRAW THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BACK IN.
Stephen: OBAMA SAYS NO  BOOTS ON THE GROUND COULD THAT  BE SEMANTICS? COULD THERE WILL BE CROCS ON THE  GROUND OR OPEN-TOED SANDALS ON  THE GROUND? BECAUSE HE'S ASKED FOR 90 DAYS. WILL IT BE CALLED A WAR?
I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S A WAR  UNDER THE DEFINITION OF THE  CONSTITUTION OR THE LAW BUT WE WILL CALL IT SOME KIND OF  MILITARY ACTION, LIMITED  MILITARY ACTION.
Stephen: OH, WELL, THEN  WE'LL BE FINE. WE'LL BE FINE. STEVE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. (APPLAUSE)  , THE DEAN OF THE COLUMBIA  SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM AND FROM  THE "NEW YORKER,"
