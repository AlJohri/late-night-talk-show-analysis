(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, I'M LIKE AN UMPIRE CALLING BALLS AND STRIKES AND IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ME I WILL STRIKE YOUR BALLS. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, ANYBODY THAT KNOWS ME KNOWS I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND AMENDMENT. I MEAN, IF IT'S NOT REAL THEN WHO LEFT ME THOSE GUNS ON CHRISTMAS MORNING? (LAUGHTER) SADLY, THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE DENIED THE JOY OF PACKING HEAT, BUT THE GOOD CORN PACKERS OF IOWA ARE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I I IN IOWA, THE "DES MOINES REGISTER" IS REPORTING THAT STATE ISSUES PERMITS TO CARRY FIREARMS IN PUBLIC TO PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND. A SPOKESWOMAN FOR A GROUP CALLED DISABILITY RIGHTS IOWA TOLD THE NEWSPAPER THAT DENYING THE BLIND GUN PERMITS WOULD VIOLATE THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.
Stephen: LOOK, THIS IS PLAIN AND SIMPLE. IF YOU'RE AGAINST BLIND AMERICANS WIELDING DEADLY WEAPONS IN PUBLIC THEN YOU HATE THE DISABLED. YOU'RE A MONSTER. I BET YOU'RE ALSO AGAINST BABY ANIMALS AND STARVING CHILDREN HAVING GUNS AS WELL. (LAUGHTER) BUT, FOLKS, SINCE I'M STEPHEN COLBERT-- FRIEND TO THE BLIND-- I AM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY ARE WHY I DO THIS RADIO SHOW EVERY NIGHT. (LAUGHTER) I WANT TO GIVE A TIP OF THE HAT TO IOWA. IT'S HIGH TIME THE BLIND HAD GUNS. THEY WORK WAY BETTER FOR NAVIGATING THE STREETS THAN THOSE GUIDE CANES. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WAVING A GUN AROUND, BELIEVE ME, A PATH WILL CLEAR. (LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I HEAR YOU. YOU MIGHT ASK "STEPHEN, WHY CAN THE BLIND BE DENIED A DRIVER'S LICENSE BUT NOT A GUN PERMIT?" WELL, GREG, THAT'S BECAUSE GUN OWNERSHIP IS CONSIDERED A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT WHILE DRIVING IS CONSIDERED A PRIVILEGE. WHICH MEANS IF THE BLIND WANT TO DRIVE, THEY SHOULD GATE TANK. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE, ACCORDING -- ACCORDING TO ALTOONA BLIND MAN MICHAEL BARBER, WHEN YOU SHOOT A GUN YOU TAKE IT OUT AND POINT AND SHOOT AND I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK EYESIGHT IS NECESSARY. (LAUGHTER) TRUE. THOUGH HE DID GIVE THAT INTERVIEW TO A POTTED FERN. (LAUGHTER) AND, UNLIKE THE SKEPTICS OUT THERE, I TRUST THE BLIND! I'M SURE THEY'LL USE THEIR GUNS RESPONSIBLY AND GET THEMSELVES A SHOOTING EYE DOG. (LAUGHTER) TO BARK AT DANGER AND, OF COURSE, A SPARE DOG FOR WHEN THEY SHOOT THE FIRST ONE. (LAUGHTER) NEXT UP ON THE-DUBS, SUMMER IS OVER AND LIKE MOST AMERICANS I HAD MY SHARE OF HOT DOGS AND COLD BEER. THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO ISSUE A TIP OF MY HAT TO BIGGER PANTS. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, DON'T MEAN GIANT CLOWN PANTS, I MEAN (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")S THAT ARE ONE SIZED LARGER THAN THE ONES I'M USED TO WEARING. SEE, I JUST GRABBED THE FIRST PAIR OF PANTS IN THE CLOSET THIS MORNING AND THEY'RE BIGGER. LET ME TELL YOU, FOLKS, I'M LOVING IT. (LAUGHTER) THEY'RE ROOMY, BREEZY, NOTHING IS SWEATING AND IT FEELS LIKE I LOST WEIGHT-- BUT I DIDN'T. (LAUGHTER) YOU HEARD IT HEAR FIRST, FOLKS, BIGGER PANTS, MAKING A DIFFERENCE. FINALLY, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE FAN OF THE BODY'S EXHIBIT. IT ANSWERS THE AGE-OLD QUESTION: "WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF BUFFALO BILL HAD AN N.E.A. GRANT?" (LAUGHTER) BUT, ACCORDING TO RECENT ARTICLES, THE BODIES IN THESE EXHIBITS MAY BE MURDERED FALUN GONG, PERHAPS EVEN THOSE KILLED FOR THEIR ORGANS, WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF THE FINGER TO RECENT ARTICLES. (LAUGHTER) WAY TO RUIN THE FUN, ARTICLES! NOW THIS WHOLE EXHIBIT OF DISSECTED HUMAN CADAVERS SEEMS KIND OF CREEPY. (LAUGHTER) WELL, I REFUSE TO LET THE BECAUSE SHACKLERS OUT THERE RUIN MY DAUGHTER'S EIGHTH BIRTHDAY PARTY. WE'RE GOING, BRITTANY, DON'T YOU WORRY! BESIDES, MUSEUM OFFICIALS ASSURE US THE CORPSES CAME FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO CHOSE TO DONATE THEIR BODIES TO MEDICAL SCIENCE. YOU HEAR THIS THAT? MEDICAL SCIENCE! OR WHATEVER THIS IS. THEY WEREN'T EXECUTED PRISONERS! I MEAN, THIS MAN CLEARLY DIED HAPPY. LOOK AT THAT SMILE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I LIKE TO BELIEVE HE DONATED HIS BODY OF HIS OWN FREE WILL. I'M SURE THERE ARE JUST A LOT MORE OPTIONS ON THE BACK OF A CHINESE DRIVER'S LICENSE. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHE
