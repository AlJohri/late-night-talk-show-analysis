Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY MY GUEST TONIGHT IS FOR CAPTAIN WHO WON THE AMERICA'S CUP-- THOUGH TO BE FAIR THE WIND DID A LOT OF WORK. PLEASE WELCOME JIMMY SPITHILL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, WELCOME ABOARD CAPTAIN JIM. THANK YOU, THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: NOW THE AMERICA'S CUP, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT BE INTO BIG BOAT SAIL RACING IT'S THE OLDEST TOURNAMENT IN THE WORLD, RIGHT?
OLDEST TROWNY INTERNATIONAL SPORT, PREDATES THE MODERN OLYMPICS, OVER 160 YEARS OLD. SO, YEAH, THE OLDEST TROPHY OUT THERE.
Stephen: AND YOU WON THIS FOR AMERICA.
WE KEPT IT HERE FOR AMERICA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW I KNOW AMERICA PRETTY WELL. I'M HAVING TROUBLE PLACING YOUR ACCENT, THOUGH. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S FROM THE SOUTH.
Stephen: IT IS. PRETTY DEEP SOUTH. YOU ARE FROM WHERE, SIR?
I'M FROM THE LAND DOWN UNDER, FROM AUSTRALIA. SYDNEY ORIGINALLY.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LET'S EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHAT IT WAS YOUR DOING IN SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR FOR THE AMERICA'S CUP. I'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF OCEAN SAILING BUT THIS IS ALMOST ENTIRELY BUT NOT COMPLETELY UNLIKE SAILING. LET'S SHOW PEOPLE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. EXPLAIN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE BOATS.
WELL, THE LIGHTEST THING ON THESE BOATS IS THE FOILING. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THERE, YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN LAIRD HAMILTON ON A SURF BOARD DOING THIS. NOW WE'RE DOING IT ON A 72 FOOT CARBON FIRE MULTIHULLS AND WE HAVE A CARBON FIBER WING, JUST LIKE THE WING OFF THE SIDE OF AN AIRCRAFT AND IT IS INSANE. RACING ON THAT BAY IT'S LIKE NASCAR ON WATER.
Stephen: I'M USED TO BEING ON A SAILBOAT ON THE WATER BUT THIS LOOKS ALMOST LIKE A SPACESHIP WITH 130-FOOT SAIL AND JUST TWO CRUISE MISSILE STRAPPED TO IT. (LAUGHTER) HOW DO YOU CONTROL SOMETHING THAT IS BARELY IN THE WATER LIKE THAT? HOW FAR DO YOU GET OFF THE WATER WHEN YOU'RE COOKING?
YOU GO PROBABLY ABOUT A METER AND A HALF TWO METERS.
Stephen: I DON'T SPEAK WHATEVER THAT IS. (LAUGHTER) A METER, IS THAT 50 FEET? TWO METERS?
I DON'T KNOW. 10 FOOT OR SOMETHING. BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER REALLY IN CONTROL. IT'S SORT OF LIKE RIDING A MOTORBIKE. YOU'RE IN CONTROL UNTIL YOU FALL OFF AND IT'S ONE HELL OF A RIDE.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE FESTEST YOU GO NOT ON THE FOILS?
NOT ON THE FOILS PROBABLY 30 KNOTS.
Stephen: AND WHEN THE FOILS KICK UP HOW FAST DO YOU GO?
THEN IT'S LIKE A TURBO BOOST. THE ONLY THING THAT STOPS YOU IS WHERE THE FOILS JUST START TO -- THE WATER BOILS AROUND THE FOILS. IT'S THAT HIGH A PRESSURE AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SPEED LIMITER. BUT AS WE GET BETTER AND LEARN MORE IT'S LIKE A QUANTUM LEAP FOR US IN THIS SPORT, WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO GO FASTER AND FASTER AND TOP SPEEDS WILL KEEP RISING.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE TOP SPEED RIGHT NOW
ON OUR BOAT ABOUT 48 KNOTS.
Stephen: AGAIN --
(LAUGHTER)
YEAH, CLOSE TO 60 MILES AN HOUR. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: 60 MILES AN HOUR? SO YOU COULD GET PULLED OVER ON SOME HIGHWAY. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THE FOUNDER OF ORACLE LARRY ELLISON ACTUALLY PAID FOR THIS. $100 MILLION COMING OUT OF HIS POCKET.
LARRY'S BEEN GREAT AND A LOT OF OTHER GREAT SPONSORS BUT LARRY'S A REAL COMPETITOR, LOVES RACING AND WHAT YOU SAW ON THE BAY WAS HIS VISION. IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE'S PEOPLED OUT THERE AND IT'S SUCH A BIG STEP FOR THE SPORT NOW.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE WORKING FOR ONE OF THE RICHEST MEMBER IN THE WORLD? DO, LIKE, 20 BILLS FALL OFF HIM? (LAUGHTER)
HE'S GREAT. THE COOLEST THING ABOUT LARRY IS HE'S SELF-MADE. HE CAME FROM NOTHING AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HIM. WHEN HE COMES DOWN TO THE BASE AND HANGS OUT WITH THE GUYS HE'S JUST LIKE ONE OF THE OTHER GUYS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE LOVES. WHEN HE COMES ON THE BOAT WE TREAT HIM LIKE ANYONE ELSE. HE GETS YELLED AT AND THAT'S SOMETHING HE'S NOT USED TO. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: ONE OF THE GOOD THING ABOUT THE AMERICA'S CUP IS NOW THAT AMERICA'S GOT IT, WE GET TO SET THE RULES FOR WHAT THE RACE HAS TO BE NEXT TIME, RIGHT?
CORRECT.
Stephen: WHO DID YOU SFWHAET
THE KIWIS, THE NEW ZEALAND TEAM.
Stephen: AS AN AUSTRALIAN, DID THAT FEEL GOOD?
OH, MATE. (LAUGHTER) YOU BEAT THOSE HOBBIT HUMPERS. (LAUGHTER)
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU, MATE, IT FEELS FANTASTIC.
Stephen: ARE THEY THE ONES THAT SET THE RULES THAT IT WOULD BE ON THE HYDRO FOIL BOATS IS?
WE WERE THE LAST ONE, BROUGHT IT TO SAN FRANCISCO BAY, PULLED OUT THE NEW BOAT, NEW FORMAT. NOW WE DO IT AGAIN SO WE COME UP WITH THE RULES. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A HUGE SUCCESS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME NON-SAILORS ARE WATCHING SAILING ON T.V.. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT.
Stephen: LIKE RIGHT NOW.
LIKE, EXACTLY. SO THAT'S WHAT'S SO COOL AND EXCITING.
Stephen: CAN I SUGGEST SOMETHINGING? SAY TO THIS LARRY: HOW ABOUT NEXT TIME SAME BOAT BUT YOU SAIL JUST ON AN OCEAN OF HIS CASH. (LAUGHTER)
I'LL GIVE IT A GO. I WON'T PROMISE ANYTHING. NEXT TIME I SPEAK TO HIM I MAY BRING THAT UP. WE'LL SEE.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT ME? I SAIL. IF YOU NEED A CREW MEMBER, I MAKE EXCELLENT BALLAST. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 6-
I TELL YOU WHAT, I BROUGHT THIS HAT ALONG BECAUSE THESE HATS ONLY THE ATHLETES WEAR, ONLY THE SAILORS SO I'M IN THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS SO I'M INVITING YOU. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, MATE, JUMP ON BOARD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JAMES SPITHILL, ORACLE TEAM U.S
