( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH, FOLKS. NATION, I'M A HUGE FAN OF WE  WILL P. THE ON-LINE SOCIAL MEDIA REVIEW  SITE FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES. IT COMBINES THE CRITICAL PALETTE  OF ZAG AFTER ATS WITH NOT HAVING  ANYTHING BETTER TO DO. BUT YELP ISN'T JUST FOR FINDING  REVIEWS OF RESTAURANTS ANYMORE.
IT'S THE WEBSITE TO GO TO  WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A  FIVE-STAR RESTAURANT. YOU CAN NOW CHECK OUT YELP IF  YOU PLAN ON GOING TO JAIL. LAWYERS, PRISON INMATES AND  THEIR FAMILIES HAVE STARTED  POSTING REVIEWS OF THE NATION'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES ON YELP. THEY RATE EVERYTHING FROM PRISON  FOOD TO ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THEY ARE NOW REVIEWING PRISONS  ON YELP. ALTHOUGH YOU DO GET YOUR  STANDARD RESTAURANT GRIPES LIKE  SERVICE TOOK FOREVER, WAS THERE FOR 25 YEARS. CHECK OUT THIS ACTUAL FOUR-STAR  REVIEW OF THE ARLINGTON COUNTY  DETENTION FACILITY BY WINDI L. QUOTE, AT NO TIME DID THE  OFFICER VIOLATE ANY OF MY  CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGES AND EVEN GAVE ME A JUICE BOX AFTER I  SAID I WAS THIRSTY. YES, YOU HEARD RIGHT. THEY HAVE JUICE BOXES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WELL, OF COURSE, THEY HAVE JUICE  BOXES. YOU CAN'T RISK SOMEONE CALLING  FOR THE KOOL AID MAN.
OH, YEAH! Stephen: I BELIEVE THAT IS  THE ORIGINAL ENDING OF THE  SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. BUT, FOLKS, MOSTLY, I'M LOVING  THIS BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS LOOKING  OUT FOR MY VIEWERS. AND I KNOW THAT A LARGE SEGMENT  OF MY AUDIENCE IS VIOLENT  CRIMINALS. AND WITH THE NEW COLBERT I-PHONE  APP, I'M SURE MANY OF YOU ARE  WATCHING THIS WHILE LEADING POLICE ON A HIGH-SPEED CHASE. FIRST OFF, BE SAFE. PUT DOWN THE PHONE. PUT YOUR HANDS AT 10 AND 2 WHILE  YOU CAREEN THROUGH TRAFFIC AT  130 MILES AN HOUR. AND IF YOU'RE STILL LISTENING,  OKAY, A LITTLE RESEARCH ON YELP,  OKAY. I'VE DONE SOME. YOU'LL WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM  GETTING ARRESTED IN QUEENS  BECAUSE A USER NAMED DAVE C HAD A SCATHING REVIEW OF THE QUEENS  CENTRAL BOOKING UNIT WRITING  NONWORKING TOILETS, OVERCROWDED ROOMS AND A GENERAL AURA OF  FAILURE, THIS PLACE SUCKS DONKEY  BALLS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND IF YOU THINK THAT'S BAD,  WAIT UNTIL YOU MEET DONKEY. SO, CRIMINALS ON THE RUN, YOUR  BEST BET IS TO DRIVE SOUTH TO  JUICE BOX COUNTRY WHERE ONCE AGAIN WINDI L WRITES, QUOTE, IF  YOU'RE GOING TO GET ARRESTED, DO  IT IN ARLINGTON COUNTY. I THINK ARLINGTON TOURISM JUST  FOUND ITS NEW SLOGAN. BUT INCARCERATION, NATION,  ACCORDING TO YELP, THERE'S ONE  PRISON YOU SHOULD SURELY AVOID. LISTEN TO THIS AWFUL FEEDBACK. A DANGEROUS, CROWDED, CRAMPED  SITUATION. I ALMOST PASSED OUT FROM THE  HEAT. DON'T BRING GUNS. THERE'S A SENSITIVE METAL  DETECTOR. AND YOU WILL SIT OUTSIDE IN A  DARK HOLDING PEN THAT FEELS LIKE  A DUNGEON. UGH! THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE. WHAT IS IT? THE COLBERT REPORT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WELL, THAT IS HARDLY FAIR. MY SHOW IS NOTHING LIKE PRISON. I MEAN 80% OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE  NOT BEEN SHIVED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
