THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE HERE IN THE GREAT CITY OF NEW  YORK ARE JUST A FEW MONTHS AWAY  FROM THE END OF MAYOR BLOOMBERG'S REIN OF TERROR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE HAS CRIPPLED THIS METROPOLIS  ABOUT HIS SODA BAN, HIS BIKE  LANES, HIS GUN RESTRICTIONS ANT CREATION OF 311, HIS CIVIC  INFORMATION LINE. THANKS BUT NO THANKS MR. MAYOR. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHY MY  STREET SMELLS THAT WAY. [LAUGHTER] THEY ARE GOING TO SAY LOOK AT  THE FIELD OF CANDIDATES  REPLACING BLOOM BEMPLEG I'M  UNIMPRESSED. ONE FAMILIAR NAME MAY ENTER THE  RICE.
ANTHONY WIENER ADMITS HE IS  SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING A  COMEBACK.
THE QUEENS CONGRESSMAN SAID  HE IS THINKING OF RUNNING FOR  MAYOR. HE SAID SURVEYS SHOW PEOPLE ARE  PREPARED FOR FORGIVE HIM.
Stephen: WILL THEY ACTUALLY  FORGIVE HIM? THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE IS  BY REVISITING THE SCANDAL THAT  FORCED HIM OUT OF OFFICE. SO SIT BACK, GRAB A BOX OF  POPCORN AND MAKE SURE THERE'S NO  HOLE IN THE BOTTOM BECAUSE HERE WE GO. IN 2011 A LINK TO THIS PHOTO  WHICH APPEARED TO BE SOMEONE  SMUGGLING A SHAVED FERRET SHOWED UP ON THEN CONGRESSMAN WIENER'S  TWITTER FEED. HE CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN HACKED  BUT A WOMAN CAME FORWARD WITH  THIS PHOTO AND THEN THIS ONE AND THEN THESE AND THEN THIS. THAT'S ENOUGH, JIM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JIM, THANK YOU. [LAUGHTER] THE CONGRESSMAN THEN RESIGNED  SAYING HE WANTED TO SPEND MORE  TIME WITH HIS PENIS. [LAUGHTER] WELL AFTER WITHDRAWING FROM  PUBLIC LIFE WIENER IS READY TO  STICK IT BACK IN. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, THAT TAKES BALLS. SADLY WE KNOW HE HAS THEM. I FOR ONE THINK WIENER WOULD BE  A GREAT NEW YORK CITY MAYOR. FOR ONE THING WE WOULDN'T HAVE  TO WORRY ABOUT A SODA BAN  BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THAT HE PUTS MORE THAN 16 OUNCES IN HIS CUP. HEY-OR OOO! [ LAUGHTER ] AND I BELIEVE THE TIME IS RIGHT. ANTHONY WIENER IS A CHANGED MAN. HIS OWN BROTHER GAVE "THE NEW  YORK TIMES" A TESTIMONIAL. THERE'S A DOWCHYNESS ABOUT HIM I  DON'T SEE ANYMORE. I THINK HIS PLAYERAL CAMPAIGN  JUST FOUND HIS SLOGAN, ANTHONY  WIENER NOW LESS DOUCHEY. THAT REDUCTION, THAT LOWERING IN  THE DOUCHEY LEVEL HAS NOT COME  EASY AS WIENER'S BROTHER POINTED OUT NO ONE HAS BEEN HARDER ON  HIM THAN HE HAS BEEN ON HIM IS. WE KNOW HOW HARD HE CAN BE ON  HIMSELF. UP TOP! AND YOU CAN HEAR JUST HOW MUCH  RESPONSIBILITY HE TAKES FOR HIS  MISTAKE SAYING QUOTE IT WAS JUST SOMETHING TECHNOLOGY MADE  POSSIBLE AND IT BECAME POSSIBLE  TOUR ME TO DO STUPID THINGS. THE THING I DID AND THE DAMAGE I  DID NOT ONLY HADN'T BEEN DONE  BEFORE BUT IT WASN'T POSSIBLE. IT'S TRUE. BEFORE TWITTER EXISTED HE WOULD  HAVE HAD TO FAX HIS DONG TO ALL  THOSE WOMEN. THAT'S NOT EASY. YOU HAVE TO GET THEM IN THE  FEEDER AND THEN HOW MANY PAGES  OF WANG PHOTOS TSMS A NIGHTMARE. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, WELCOME BACK ANTHONY  WIENER. AND GOOD NEWS GOOD NEWS WE HAVE  NEW INTERNET TECHNOLOGY CALLED  INSTAGRAM NOW. SO YOU CAN ADD A SEEPA TONE TO  MAKE YOUR JUNK SHOT LOOK LIKE IT  CAME FROM A TIME WHEN YOU COULD GET ELECT
