THEY CALL THOUGHT BECAUSE A  LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE FROM THE  URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS OR FROM THE HOOD OR, UM, THEY USED TO A --  IT WAS LIKE A CONFIDENT LINE  DANCE. MIND IF YOU SHOW YOU?
Stephen: NO, PLEASE.
SO THE GANG IS IT A WALK WAS  LIKE A -- GANGSTER WALK YOU SEE  IT IN CRYSTAL PALACE. WE USED TO GO TO SKATING RINKS  WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER. IT'S LIKE A CONFIDENT STEP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GANG STER WALKING EVOLVED TO  JOOKIN. THEY CALL IT THAT BECAUSE A LOT  OF PEOPLE DID IT. IT WAS LIKE A SORE ERRORITY  LINE.

Stephen: THE DANCING ITSELF  IS SO SHARP. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS INCREDIBLE. YOU'VE TAKEN THIS TO ANOTHER  LEVEL. SOMEONE SAW YOU WHO WAS IN THE  BALLET WORLD. HOW DID YOU GET DISCOVERED BY  CLASSICAL DANCER?
I GOT DISCOVERED BECAUSE I  USED TO BE A PART OF A GROUP  CALLED SUB CULTURE ROYALTY AND WE USED TO PRACTICE IN A BALLET  STUDIO CALLED NEW BALLET  ENSEMBLE IN SCHOOLS IN MEMPHIS,  TENNESSEE. WHEN WE WERE REHEARSING THERE  THE BALLET INSTRUCTOR WAS ALSO  THERE. WE WERE REHEARSING THE HIP-HOP. I WAS DOING HIP-HOP AND JOOKIN. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  THEM.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO  TELL ME, I KNOW THAT.
OF COURSE. THE TEACHER SAW ME SPINNING ON  MY TOES. I DID FOUR SPINS, PROBABLY FIVE,  SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT -- SHE SAW ME  AND SAID I HAVE TO GIVE THIS KID A SCHOLARSHIP AND PUT HIM IF A  CLASS. WE WERE JUST REHEARSING THERE. I WAS LIKE I DON'T KNOW BALLET. THE FIRST THING THAT CAME TO  MIND WAS TIGHTS? NO. AND THEN -- BUT --
Stephen: THEY SAID YOU  DON'T HAVE TO WEAR THE TIGHTS.
YEAH.
