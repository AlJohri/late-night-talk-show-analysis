( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: TONIGHT, A DEADLY VIRUS HITS AMERICA. PRESIDENT OBAMA, IT IS TIME TO REINFORCE OUR SALAD BAR SNEEZE GUARDS. THEN, A BATTLE OVER OUR NATION'S BEACHES. I HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE, UNTIL THE TIDE GOES OUT, AND THEN I'VE HAD IT DOWN TO HERE. AND MY GUEST, LYNN SHERR, HAS BEEN COVERING NASA SINCE 1981, THAT'S 33 IN EARTH YEARS. ADAM SANDLER HAS SIGNED A FOUR-MOVIE DEAL WITH NETFLIX. BIG DEAL. I GET UNLIMITED MOVIES FROM THEM. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THANK YOU. FOLKS-- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- MR. AND MRS. AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS OUT AT SEA, THANK YOU FOR  BEING HERE, IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. EVERYONE WATCHING ON SATELLITE RIGHT NOW AND ON THE THE WIRELESS. FOLKS, LET'S FACE IT, THERE'S ONLY ONE STORY TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT AND THAT IS EBOLA. THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO KNOW-- DO NOT TOUCH ME. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, BECAUSE IF YOU DO, IF YOU DO, I WILL CUT YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. THEM I WILL CLEAN UP VERY THOROUGHLY. FOLKS, FOR WEEKS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS DEADLY PANDEMIC TAKING HOLD AND IN WHO CARES-ISTAN. BUT NOW--
BREAKING RIGHT NOW THE FIRST CONFIRMED CASE OF EBOLA RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
THE FIRST CASE OF EBOLA DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES. A MAN IN TEXAS, NOW IN ISOLATION.
EBOLA, IT'S HERE.
IT IS HERE, EBOLA.
EBOLA, HERE.
Stephen: YES, EBOLA HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, THAT IS CRAP-YOUR-PANTS TERRIFYING IN THAT CRAP YOUR PANTS IS ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS OF EBOLA. AND NOW THAT THE VIRUS HAS HIT AMERICA, IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT INFECTS US ALL. I MEAN WHAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH IGGY AZALEA. ( LAUGHTER ) SO IT IS TIME FOR TONIGHT'S.
DEATHPOCALYPSE NOW. EBOLA IN AMERICA. 50 STATES OF GRAVE.
Stephen: BY THE WAY, THAT EXPLODING GRAPHIC JUST SPREAD EBOLA ALL OVER THE INSIDE OF YOUR TV SCREEN. REMEMBER, FOLKS, ANYBODY CAN GET EBOLA JUST BY COMING IN CONTACT WITH AN INFECTED PURPOSE'S BODILY FLUIDS, INCLUDING BLOOD, SWEAT, FECES, VOMIT, SEMEN, AND SPIT. SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO AVOID THE NEXT GATHERING OF THE JUGGALOS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I WON'T BE FOOLED INTO STAYING CALM BY THE SO-CALLED EXPERTS WITH THEIR SO-CALLED MEDICAL DEGREES AND THEIR SO-CALLED FINGERS. AND NEITHER WILL THE FOX AND FRIEND.
EBOLA IS-- IS NOT AS CONTAGIOUS. IT'S A VERY INFECTIOUS VIRUS, BUT IT'S NOT AS CONTAGIOUS.
YOU HAVE A VERY CALM TONE. I THINK IT MUST COME BY NATURE WITH WHAT YOU DO PROFESSIONALLY, DOCTOR. BUT I THINK THE REST OF US ARE SAYING, WAIT A MINUTE.
I WONDER IF THEY'RE JUST TRYING NOT TO PANIC US OR THEM.
AGAIN, IT'S BECAUSE-- THOSE-- SORRY.
Stephen: DID YOU HEAR THAT COUGH! DID YOU HEAR THAT COUGH? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) COME ON! SHE CLEARLY HAS EBOLA! AND NOW SO DO ALL THE FOX AND FRIENDS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THANK GOD, THANK GOD-- YES, THEY'RE LIKE TINKERBELL, YOU HAVE TO CLAP TO KEEP THEM ALIVE. AND IF WE DO LOSE ONE OF THEM THANK GOD THERE'S A SPARE DOOCY. FORTUNATELY, FOLKS, FOR EVERY MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL OUT THERE REASSURING US THERE'S A TV PROFESSIONAL RESCARING US.
YOU'LL VOMIT CONNTROLLABLY. YOU'LL BLEED FROM YOUR NOSE, EYES, EARS ELSEWHERE. YOUR ORGANS WILL START TO FAIL. YOUR SKIN WILL BECOME YELLOWISH WITH JAUNDICE, AND THE BLEEDING BECOMES SEVERE. AND THERE IS NO CURE.
Stephen: NO CURE? I THOUGHT NYQUIL WAS THE SNIFFLING, SNEEZING, FEVER, JAUNDICE, BLEEDING FROM THE MOUTH, NOSE, EYES SO YOU CAN REST MEDICINE. AND WITH OUR GOVERNMENT JUST CLUELESS ABOUT THIS CRISIS, ONCE AGAIN IT FALLS TO THE PUNDIT SECTOR TO SOLVE IT.
SHOULD WE BE STOPPING TAKING FLIGHTS FROM THESE EBOLA HOT ZONES IN WEST AFRICA?
WHY ARE WE NOT STOPPING AIR TRAVEL BETWEEN LIBERIA AND OTHER NATIONS?
WHY ARE WE ALLOWING THESE FLIGHTS INTO THE U.S. RIGHT NOW?
SHOULD WE JUST ISOLATE THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THIS.
Stephen: CLEARLY WE HAVE TO CUT OFF ALL CONTACT WITH PLACES WITH EBOLA, STARTING WITH A BORDER WALL AROUND TEXAS. LISTEN-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LISTEN-- LISTEN, I KNOW YOU GUYS ALWAYS WANTED TO BE YOUR OWN COUNTRY. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS, YOUR FOUNDING FATHER IS RICK PERRY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) EVEN THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH. WE GOT TO TREAT THIS LIKE THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE. I SAY WE RE-ROUTE THE KEYSTONE OIL PIPELINE INTO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND SET THAT ( BLEEP ) ON FIRE! OKAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT SERVES YOU RIGHT. IT SERVES YOU RIGHT FOR HAVING RADIO STATIONS THAT BEGIN WITH "K." EVERYONE OVER THERE, EVERY ON THAT SIDE OF THE RIVER IS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM, BUT REMEMBER, THERE'S NO "I" IN MISSISSIPPI. FOLKS, THESE ARE CLEARLY THE END TIMES, AND I HOPE YOU'RE SPENDING THEM WITH YOUR CLOSEST LOVED ONES. I AM SPENDING THEM WITH SOMEONE I NEVER MET BEFORE. PLEASE WELCOME THE HEAD OF THE INFECTION CONTROL PROGRAM AT MEMORIAL SLOAN KETTERING HOSPITAL, DR. KENT SEPKOWITZ. DOCTOR THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: DOCTOR, DOCTOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) BE HONEST-- HOW MUCH URINE AND FECES WERE YOU HANDLING BACKSTAGE BEFORE YOU CAME HERE?
NONE WHATSOEVER
Stephen: I'LL CHECK THE WEB-CAM.
I MIGHT HAVE TO RETHINK IT. NONE WHATSOEVER.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT I'M GOING TO GET EBOLA?
ZERO. NEXT QUESTION.
Stephen: COME ON. WHAT DO YOU MEAN ZERO? WHAT YOU MEAN ZERO? THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID.  THE PRESIDENT SAID IT'S UNLIKELY WE'RE GOING TO GET AN OUTBREAK OF EBOLA IN THE UNITED STATES. AND NOW HE'S TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG. YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE RIGHTER THAN THE PRESIDENT?
I'M RIGHTER THAN THE PRESIDENT, THAT'S CORRECT
Stephen: REALLY.
YES. THERE'S ACTUALLY SCIENCE BEHIND THIS.
Stephen: HE SAID UNLIKELY. YOU SAID ZERO PERCENT. YOU'RE GOING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. THE PROOF IS WE HAVE IT NOW IN AMERICA.
WE HAVE ONE CASE NOW. THERE IS ACTUAL SCIENCE BEHIND THIS. THIS IS NOT RUMOR AND PUNDITOCRACY DOING THIS. THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES. WE HAVE HAD 20 OUTBREAKS OF EBOLA IN THE LAST 40 YEARS.
Stephen: NEVER ONE THIS BAD.
NEVER ONE THIS BAD. WE KNOW HOW IT'S TRANSMITTED. WE EVEN KNOW HOW IT'S TRANSMITTED IN THE HOUSEHOLD. IN THE HOUSEHOLD IT'S NOT EVEN THAT CONTAGIOUS, AND THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A SICK MOM OR DAD AND THERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS. ONE IN SEVEN FAMILY MEMBERS COMES DOWN WITH EBOLA, EVEN IN THAT CLOSE CONFINE.
Stephen:  THIS GUY-- SEVEN FAMILY MEMBERS -- THIS GUY, WHAT ARE THEY SAYING NOW, THIS GUY MAY HAVE EXPOSED EBOLA UP TO 100 PEOPLE.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: DOES EBOLA MAKE YOU POPULAR?
IT MAKES YOU VERY POPULAR.
Stephen: 100 PEOPLE. THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.
THAT'S TEXAS NUMBERS. WHAT CAN I TELL YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: ONE OF US-- ONE OF US IS TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.
ONE OF US IS.
Stephen: SO WHAT CAN I DO-- WHAT CAN I DO TO AVOID EBOLA?
I THINK YOU ACTUALLY SAID IT-- DON'T GET PHYSICALLY CLOSE TO SOMEONE WHO IS BLEEDING TO DEATH WOULD BE MY MAIN ADVICE.
Stephen: OKAY.
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE AMOUNT OF VIRUS IN BLOOD IS SKY HIGH IN SOMEONE WHO IS INFECTIOUS.
Stephen: OKAY.
AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET INFECTED IS TO TOUCH THAT BLOOD BARE HANDED OR SMEAR IT ON YOUR FACE WHICH MAYBE YOU WOULD BE INCLINED TO DO. I DON'T KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IT DEPENDS ON HOW GOOD THE PARTY IS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT I THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD A SEVEN-MONTH OUTBREAK, YOU KNOW, NUMBERING NOW IN 7,000-PLUS CASES, THIS IS NOT THAT CONTAGIOUS A DISEASE WHICH I KNOW ALL OF US KEEP SAYING?
Stephen: THE PRETTY LADY ON TV SAID NO CURE.
NO CURE.
Stephen: OKAY? IS THERE NO CURE FOR THIS?
THE BODY'S OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM IS THE ONLY CURE. THERE IS NOT AN APPROVED DRUG.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THAT Z-MAPP STUFF? I'M A CELEBRITY,  I CAN GET WHAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN'T.
WE HAVE A HAND FULL OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN Z-MAPP. Z-MAP MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT WORK. THE STUDIES ARE NOT IN YET.
Stephen: CARDS ON THE TABLE TIME, ALL RIGHT? DOES SOMEONE ELSE COME DOWN WITH EBOLA BECAUSE THIS GUY HAD EBOLA SOMEBODY IN TEXAS?
THERE MIGHT BE ONE SECONDARY CASE, THERE MIGHT BE TWO SECONDARY CASE.
Stephen:  SO THERE COULD BE 100% INCREASE IN EBOLA IN THE UNITED STATES.
THAT IS CORRECT.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR THAT SHOCKING NEWS, DOCTOR.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: DR. KENT SEPKOWITZ, MEMORIAL SLOAN KETTERING CANCER CENTER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, MAYBE THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
