Colbert: A MEMOIR. OKAY. WORLDWIDE CROSSOVER COUNTRY,  ULTIMATE ACTOR, FIVE MINISERIES  WORKED BASED ON ONE SONG, THE  GAMBLER ALONE, WHY GOING INTO A DYING INDUSTRY LIKE PUBLISHING?   ESPECIALLY THE SAME WEEK THAT MY  BOOK AMERICA AGAIN -- YOU HAVE  GOT TO GET THAT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN LUCK OR  SOMETHING LIKE IT?  WAS YOUR  CAREER LUCK OR HARD WORK OR  SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
IT WAS LUCK. I STARTED IN JAZZ. I WAS IN A JAZZ GROUP.

Colbert: RUBY, DON'T TAKE  YOUR LOVE TO TOWN. IT IS A HEARTWARMING -- IT IS A  HEARTWARMING STORY OF A  PARALYZED VIETNAM VET WHO WANTS  TO KILL HIS WIFE WITH A SHOTGUN. BUT YOU SING ALONG WITH HIM.

I SING ABOUT TERRIBLE PERSON. THE GAMBLER.
THE GAMBLER IS ONE OF THE  BEST KNOWN COUNTRY SONGS OF  ALL-TIME, HUGE HIT AROUND THE  WORLD, I MEAN, FIVE MINISERIES ABOUT ONE SONG!
Colbert: YOU ARE THE  GAMBLER. YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHEN YOU HOLD  THEM, KNOW WHEN TO FOLD THEM.
KNOW WHEN TO WALK AWAY.
Colbert: KNOW WHEN TO RUN. THAT IS GOOD ADVICE BUT AT NO  POINT IN THE SONG DO YOU SAY  WHEN THAT IS TO HOLD THEM OR  FOLD THEM, WHY DO YOU LEAVE OUT THE DETAILS IN A SONG ABOUT HOW  TO PLAY POKER?
PERSONAL INTERPRETATION.
Colbert: REALLY?  IS IT A  METAPHOR?
IT IS A METAPHOR.
Colbert: WHAT IS THE SONG A  METAPHOR OF?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
