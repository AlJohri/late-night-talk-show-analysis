[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: OH, HI. WELCOME BACK TO THE COLBERT BOOK CLUB, EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: FOLKS, IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US AND WANT TO CATCH UP YOU NEED TO DRINK A FIFTH OF WHISKEY AND MAKE LOVE TO A BISON. TONIGHT IS ALL ABOUT ERNEST HEMINGWAY. HIS BOOKS HAVE TURNED INTO AT LEAST 15 FEATURE FILMS. MY FAVORITE, ERNEST GOES TO CAMP. HEMINGWAY WAS A BADASS. EVEN ABOUT THE ACT OF WRITING. SAYING THERE IS NOTHING TO WRITING. ALL DO YOU IS SIT DOWN AT THE TYPEWRITER AND BLEED. ASO POIGNANT. IT CALLS TO MIND THE WORDS OF HEMINGWAY'S  CLEANING LADY, "DEAR GOD, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED IN HERE." HERE TO TELL US MORE ABOUT HEMINGWAY THE MAN, IS HEMINGWAY THE WOMAN. PLEASE WELCOME MARIEL HEMINGWAY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. -- MARIEL. WOULD YOU LIKE A GLASS OF WINE?
Don: Stephen: YOU DON'T WANT A GLASS OF WINE. ALRIGHT. THAT IS THE FIRST SUBJECT. YOU HAVE A BOOK CALLED "RUNNING WITH NATURE" YOU WROTE WITH YOUR PARTNER BOBBIE WILLIAMS.
YES. Stephen: PHOTO, FULL FRAME. I'M OFFENDED BY HOW HEALTHY AND HAPPY YOU LOOK IN THE PHOTO.
YOU ARE? Stephen: YOU HAVE A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.
I DO. Stephen: DO YOU THINK YOUR HARD LIVING GRANDFATHER WOULD AGREE OF A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE OF MICRO BIOTICS AND TEA AND NOT WINE AND WHISKEY.
I THINK HE WOULD HE LIVED IN A TIME WHERE THEY DIDN'T REALIZE DRINKING TOO MUCH, LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN DOING ALL EVENING, AND LIVING THE HARD LIFE IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU. HE WAS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE CHARACTERS HE WAS WRITING ABOUT. THINK IF HE WAS MORE STABLE IT WOULD OF BEEN BETTER FOR HIM.
Stephen: YOU HAVE DONE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT WHAT SOME MAY CALL ESCAPING THE HEMINGWAY CURSE.
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A CURSE. THERE IS THE MYTH. THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION OF HOW HEMINGWAY IS SUPPOSED TO BE. YOUR DRESS AND YOUR BEHAVIOR. A MAN'S MAN.
Stephen: I DIDN'T NAIL IT?
YOU NAILED IT, YOU GOT IT RIGHT.
Stephen: THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.
THE IDEA IT'S ABOUT BEING A, YOU KNOW A MAN THAT IS GOING TO KILL EVERYTHING. I THINK HE UNDERSTOOD LOVE STORIES. I THINK HE UNDERSTOOD THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN A RELATIONSHIP. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A STORY ABOUT WAR. I REALLY FEEL HIS UNDERSTANDING OF WOMEN AND THE SUBTLETIES OF LIFE. NOT JUST THE MACHISMO, BIG THINGS.
Stephen: THERE IS ROMANCE IN THE STORIES. WE MEN REALIZE FROM READING HEMINGWAY TO GET THE GIRL WE MAY HAVE TO BE DISTANT AND HARD LIVING AND HARD DRINKING. THAT'S THE ORIGINAL MARLBORO MAN FOR AMERICA, HEMINGWAY.
MAKING MEN, MEN IS A GREAT THING. IT'S WHAT WE TAKE FROM HIM.
Stephen: THE LADIES LIKE IT.
THE LADIES LIKE IT. I ADMIT THAT.
Stephen: TO IMPRESS THE LADIES THOSE OF US WHO ARE FANS FEEL WE HAVE TO GO TO THE FROZEN FISH ISLE AND WRESTLE THE GORDON FISH STICKS AND PUNCH THEM BEFORE PUTTING THEM IN THE MICROWAVE. DID YOU HAVE TO READ HIS BOOKS IN HIGH SCHOOL? WERE YOU ASSIGNED ERNEST HEMINGWAY IN HIGH SCHOOL?
I WAS LIKE EVERY OTHER KID. I READ "OLD MAN IN THE SEA." DID MY SIXTH GRADE BOOK REPORT.
Stephen: DID YOU GET A GOOD GRADE?
Don: JUST KIDDING. I READ IT WITH MY FATHER IN PARIS WHEN I WAS 11 YEARS OLD. I READ IT BEFORE I WENT TO PARIS. THEN I READ WHILE I WAS IN PARIS AND ANOTHER BOOK ABOUT MY GRANDFATHER GOING THROUGH PARIS WHEN HE WAS MARRIED TO MY GRAND MOTHER AND HAD MY FATHER WHO IS MENTIONED IN THE BOOK.
Stephen: IS THAT LIKE READING A FAMILY DIARY OR A BOOK?
NO, IT FEELS LIKE A BOOK. I WASN'T ALIVE WHEN HE WAS ALIVE. IT -- THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT WAS SPECIAL.
Tom: HAVE YOUR FATHER TELL YOU STORIES ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PLACES THAT HE ACTUALLY GREW UP IN. IT'S PRETTY POWERFUL WAY TO HEAR ABOUT IT.
Stephen: FOR SUCH A GREAT AMERICAN WRITER, SOME SAY THE GREATEST AMERICAN WRITER OFF THE 20th CENTURY. WHY DID HE WRITE SO MUCH ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES? ISN'T THERE SOMETHING IN AMERICA TO INSPIRE HIM? HE DOESN'T NEED PARIS, WE HAVE EPCOT. DOES THAT OFFEND YOU?
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW HOW HIS MOTHER DRESSED HIM FOR SO LONG. HE WANTED TO GET THE HELL OUT OF DODGE. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WAS ABOUT?
I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER. THAT BEGS AN ANSWER.
Stephen: YOUR GRANDFATHER SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN CUBA. HIS BOAT IS THERE, THE PILAR. AND THE HOUSE IS THERE. WHEN FIDEL CASTRO DIES YOU'RE OPENING A HOTEL, RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO, YOU CAN CASH. IN "I GOT HAMMERED AT HEMINGWAYS" YOU HAVE TO OPEN A HOTEL. MARIEL, THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. MARIEL HEMINGWAY "RUNNING WITH NATURE" WE WILL BE RIGHT
