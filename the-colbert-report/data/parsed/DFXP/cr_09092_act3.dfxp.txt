Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST SOANT IS THE FIRST  OPENLY GAY.
PESK PAL BISHOP WHICH I  BELIEVE MEANS HE CAN ONLY MOVE  DIAGONALLY. PLEASE WELCOME BISHOP GENE ROBIN ROB  ROBINSON.
YOUR EXCELLENCY, THANKS SO  MUCH FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT, FOR THE PEOPLE WHO  DON'T KNOW OUT THERE, YOU WERE  ELECTED BISHOP OF THE. ISCOPALEP  DIOCESE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND  THIS CAUSED A BIT OF A STIR  BECAUSE YOU WERE THE FIRST OPENLY GAY MAN IN THE EPISCOPAL  CHURCH. YOU HAVE A BOOK CALLED, "GOD  BELIEVES IN LOVE:  STRAIGHT TALK  ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE." I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO HAVE YOU  ON FOR YEARS, AS YOU KNOW,  BECAUSE I AM A ROMAN CATHOLIC. AND YOUR CHURCH, THE ANGLICAN,  YOU KNOW, CAME FROM A REJECTION  OF CENTRAL AUTHORITY. AND WHEN YOU BECAME A BISHOP,  SOME OF THE EPISCOPALIANS  SNAPPED OFF AND TRIED TO BECOME ANGLICAN AGAIN SO THEY'D HAVE A  CENTRAL AUTHORITY TO TELL YOU,  YOU WERE WRONG. ( LAUGHTER ). THAT'S DELICIOUS. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  WHAT DID YOU THINK-- WHAT DID  YOU THINK WHEN THAT HAPPENED?
YOU KNOW, THE CHURCH AT ITS  BEST --
Stephen:  YOU MEAN THE  CATHOLIC CHURCH.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CHURCH,  CAPITAL C.
Stephen:  YOU ARE A CHURCH,  BUT GO AHEAD.
WANTS TO WELCOME ALL OF GOD'S  CHILDREN. AND WE HAD THIS DISAGREEMENT  ABOUT SOME OF GOD'S CHILDREN WHO  WERE NOT WELCOME, AND THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH MEANS TO  WELCOME EVERYONE. AND THOSE WHO COULDN'T QUITE  STOMACH THAT LEFT. AND WE'RE FEELING LIKE WE'RE  FOLLOWING GOD'S CALL.
Stephen:  THAT'S ONE OF THE  BEEFS I HAVE WITH YOUR CHURCH IS  YOU-- THERE'S A SIGN ON THE EDGE OF TOWN THAT SAYS, "THE  EPISCOPAL CHURCH WELCOMES YOU."
AND IT HAS NO ASTERISK WITH  EXCEPTIONS?
Stephen:  NO IT, DOESN'T. THAT'S ONE THING I DON'T GET IT  ABOUT-- IT DOESN'T SEEM  EXCLUSIVE THAT WAY. YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT  COOLAVE CLUB IF ANYBODY COULD BE  PART OF IT,UN WHAT I MEAN? YOU.
THE INTERESTING THING IS  JESUS JUST WASN'T THAT COOL. JESUS WAS ALWAYS TALKING TO THE  MARGINALIZED, THOSE PUT DOWN BY  SOCIETY. HE SPENT ALL OF HIS TIME WORKING  WITH THEM, LOVING THEM IN WAITZ  THEY HAD NEVER BEEN LOVED  BEFORE. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO  BE.
Stephen:  ANOTHER BUT JESUS  ALSO SAYS--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE PLAYED THE JESUS CARD, WHICH, OF  COURSE, IS A CROWD PLEASER.
IT'S A GREAT CARD!
Stephen:  IT IS A GREAT  CARD BUT I CAN PLAY THE JESUS  CARD, TOO, BECAUSE JESUS SAYS I HAVE NOT COME TO ELIMINATE A  SINGLE LAW, AND ONE OF THE LAWS  WAS A MAN SHALL NOT LAY WITH ANOTHER MAN, AND IT'S AN  ABOMINATION AND SHOULD BE PUT TO  DEATH. WAS GOD HAVING A BAD DAY? WAS THAT A BRAIN FART? WHY DID HE PUT THAT DOWN THERE?
THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THAT  WERE HAVING A BAD GAY DAYIN  PERCEIVING GOD'S WILL, AND OVER TIME IT SEEMS TO ME WE PERCEIVE  GOD'S WILL BETTER AND BETTER. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S SO  EXCITING TO BE ALIVE RIGHT NOW  IS WE'RE ASKING DID THE CHURCH-- DID THE SYNAGOGUE GET IT WRONG  ABOUT GAY, LESBIAN, BISEXUAL,  AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE? I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES.   ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  LET'S TALK A  LITTLE STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT GAY  MARRIAGE HERE, OKAY? ( LAUGHTER )
YOU'RE STRAIGHT, RIGHT?
Stephen:  AS STRAIGHT AS  THEY COME, BABY DOLL. I LOVE THE LADIES. ( LAUGHTER ). NOW, HERE'S MY PROBLEM. THIS IS WHERE I THINK WE GOT IN  TROUBLE, OKAY. WE MADE BEING GAY LEGAL. ALL RIGHT, AND ONCE IT'S LEGAL,  YOU CAN'T KEEP THEM FROM GETTING  MARRIED. ONCE YOU ACCEPT GAY AS BEING  LEFT-HANDED, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T  KEEP LEFT-- YOU CAN'T KEEP LEFT-HANDED PEOPLE FROM GETTING  MARRIED, AS MUCH AS WE WOULD  LIKE TO. RIGHT?
AND THAT'S GREAT, RIGHT?
Stephen:  IS IT RAY CHOICE? THAT'S MY QUESTION. IS IT LIKE BEING LEFT HANDED,  BEING GAY?
IT'S A LOT LIKE BEING  LEFT-HANDED. THAT IS TO SAY-- IT'S PROBABLY  SOME COMBINATION OF GENETICS AND  BEHAVIORAL STUFF, BUT THE POINT OF THE MATTER IS, BY THREE YEARS  OLD, SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS SET. SO IT'S NOT A CHOICE IN ANY  REASONABLE SENSE OF THE WORD. AND --
Stephen:  IS BEING  EPISCOPALIAN A CHOICE?
YOU KNOW, IT IS ONE OF THE  BEST CHOICES IN THE HISTORY OF  THE WORLD.
Stephen:  REALLY?
YEAH, IT'S LIKE-- IT'S LIKE--  ( LAUGHTER )  IT'S LIKE ADVANCED PLACEMENT  RELIGION. ( LAUGHTER ). ( APPLAUSE )  IT'S FOR THINKING PEOPLE.
Stephen:  AS I SAID THERE  WAS A SCHISM IN THE EPISCOPAL  CLUTCH AND SOME MODIDN'T WANT TO ACCEPT GAY OR LESBIAN BISHOPS OR  FEMALE BISHOPS TRIED TO JOIN  WITH THE ANGLICAN CHURCH IN AFRICA, ACTUALLY. NOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN A BASQUE BISHOP  FOR HOW MANY YEARS--
10 YEAR.
Stephen:  IS IT GETTING  BETTER, ARE THEY UNSCHISMING? ARE THEY SCHISMING BACK OR DID  THEY CALL NO BACK?
A LOT ARE COMING BACK AND  THEY WOULD BE WELCOME BACK ANY  MINUTE OF ANY DAY, AND IT'S GOING BETTER WITH THE AFRICANS. THEIR CONTEXT IS TOW DIFFERENT  THAN OURSELVES. YOU KNOW, IF YOU COME OUT AS GAY  THERE YOU CAN BE ARRESTED AND IN  SOME PLACES PUT TO DEATH. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE  NUMBERS OF PEOPLE LIKE WE HAVE  IN AMERICA WHO HAS COME OUT. EVERYBODY NOW KNOWS SOMEONE GAY. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE A  FACE COMES UP OR A RELATIONSHIP  COMES UP. AND YOU'RE JUST NOT WILLING TO  BELIEVE THE AWFUL THINS SAID  ABOUT US.
Stephen:  I HOPE YOU  HAVEN'T THOUGHT I SAID ANY AWFUL  THINGS ABOUT YOU TONIGHT OTHER THAN YOU'RE PART OF A HERETICAL  RELIGION THAT WILL GET YOU SENT  TO HELL, BUT THAT'S JUST IN MY  MANUAL.
AND PROUD OF IT.
Stephen:  OKAY. WELL, THANK YOU, BISHOP. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME. RESERVE GENE ROBINSON. THE BOOK IS "GOD BELIEVES IN  LOVE."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WE
