(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACCLAIMED FILMMAKER WHO GOT HIS START WITH MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS, AND NOW HE DOES SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. PLEASE WELCOME TERRY GILLIAM! ♪♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: I'M A HUGE FAN! I LOVE YOU, STEVE CARELL!
OH, OH, AHHH!
HOW DO WE LOOK? (LAUGHTER) ♪♪ (LAUGHTER) ♪♪ (LAUGHTER) ♪♪
WHOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: TERRY! HEY! THANKS FOR COMING ON!
THANK YOU!
STEPHEN: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT AND WEARING WHAT I ASSUME IS YOUR FORMAL BATHROBE.
MM-HMM. YES.
STEPHEN: TERRY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
IT'S GOOD TO BE IN THE TEMPLE OF COLBERT.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'LL TAKE THE EXTRA T. I'M SAVING THEM AND SENDING THEM OFF TO THE FRENCH COUNTRIES  THAT NEED THEM. IN YOUR MOVIES LIKE "BRAZIL" AND "12 MONKEYS" AND IN THIS ONE CALLED "THE ZERO THEOREM," THE FUTURE IS NOT THE HAPPIEST PLACE IN THE WORLD. WHY DO YOU SEE THE FUTURE AS BLEAK? MAYBE THINGS ALL WORK OUT IN THE FUTURE.
HAVE YOU WATCHED THE FILM?
STEPHEN: I SAW 40 SECONDS OF IT.
THAT'S ENOUGH. EXACTLY. IT'S WHAT I SUSPECTED ALL ALONG. I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT HERE, AND AS YOU SEE THE WORKS, THE OEUVRE
STEPHEN: I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH IT'S THE WAY THE FRENCH PRONOUNCE "COLBERT."  SO I THOUGHT YOU'D BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT.
STEPHEN: WHY DON'T WE SHOW THE AUDIENCE A LITTLE BIT OF IT.
IF YOU WISH
STEPHEN: I DON'T PARTICULARLY (LAUGHTER) THANK GOD THERE'S INTELLIGENT PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE  THAT WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH
LET'S SEE A LITTLE BIT IT'S THE "THE ZERO THEOREM."
THANK YOU. ♪♪ (INDISCERNIBLE TALKING) ♪♪ (INDISCERNIBLE TALKING) ♪♪ (INDISCERNIBLE TALKING)
STEPHEN: WILL I BE SAD WHEN I LEAVE THE MOVIE?
YOU WILL. BUT YOU WILL LAUGH BEFORE YOU'RE SAD. YOU WILL GO THROUGH ALL THE EMOTIONS LIFE CAN GIVE US.
STEPHEN: WILL I BE A SADDER, BUT WISER MAN?
WIDER, SADDER, BUT WHEN YOU REFLECT ON IT LATER, YOU WILL REALIZE YOU SAW TRUTH AND YOU'RE A MAN WHO BELIEVES IN TRUTH.
STEPHEN: I BELIEVE IN MY TRUTH (LAUGHTER) MY TRUTH IS IS THE TRUTH THAT I WISH TO BE TRUE, NOT WHAT  THE FACTS SUPPORT. I DON'T WANT TO BE SADDER AND WISER, I WANT TO BE HAPPIER AND DUMBER.
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE RENOUNCED MY AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP.
STEPHEN: BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A HAPPY IDIOT?
YES! I THINK YOU PUT IT BEAUTIFULLY (LAUGHTER) I DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING. (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: I NOTICED A THEME. IN BRAZIL, IT WAS BIG GOVERNMENT.
YES.
STEPHEN: YOU SEEM MORE AFRAID OR THREATENED BY CORPORATIONS.
I THINK WE OUGHT TO. I THINK YOU MIGHT EVEN AGREE WITH ME ON SOME OF THIS.
STEPHEN: PROBABLY NOT.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN...
STEPHEN: TELL THE PEOPLE WATCHING THIS GREAT VIACOM PROGRAM WHY CORPORATIONS ARE BAD RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER)
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO REACH ACROSS THIS GAP THAT'S SEPARATING US. LET'S HOLD HANDS AND THINK TOGETHER.
STEPHEN: OKAY.
CORPORATIONS --
STEPHEN: CORPORATIONS, YES, THEY'RE PEOPLE.
THEY MAKE US HAPPY.
STEPHEN: THEY DO BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THINGS LIKE THIS. THIS BEAUTIFUL THING.
EXACTLY.
STEPHEN: THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL THING OF THE FUTURE. OH, OKAY. YES, THAT OLD THING! (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOURSELF A NEW GIRL!
THIS ONE DOESN'T HAVE THE UNSIGHTLY BULGE IN THE TROUSERS. IT'S THE OLD ONE.
STEPHEN: OH REALLY? BUT THIS ONE MAKES ME LOOK HAPPY TO SEE YOU. (LAUGHTER) IN THE MOVIE, CHRIS OWNS --
HE OWNS NOTHING. HE'S A MAN WHO WORKS FOR A CORPORATION. HE'S INCREDIBLY SKILLED AT THE COMPUTER ACTIVITY.
STEPHEN: I THOUGHT HE WAS PLAYING TWO PIANOS AT ONCE.
HE CAN DO THAT AS WELL. HE'S AN ACTOR, A CHARACTER AND BRILLIANT PIANIST IN PRIVATE LIFE. BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MOVIE. HE'S A COMPUTER GENIUS AND HE HAS A TASK OF SOLVING THE ZERO THEOREM TO PROVE EVERYTHING IS MEANINGLESS. ALL IS NOTHING.
STEPHEN: MAYBE NOTHING IS ALL.
GLASS HALF FULL, HALF EMPTY.
STEPHEN: MAYBE HALF FULL. MAYBE FULL OF URINE AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DRINK IT (LAUGHTER)
YES. BUT THAT'S HIS TASK. THE PROBLEM IS HE'S ANTISOCIAL. HE'S NOT A SOCIAL NETWORKER. HE TRIES TO DISCONNECT FROM THAT AND WORK AT HOME LIKE SO MANY OF US DREAM OF.
STEPHEN: IS THIS AUTO BIOGRAPHICAL? DO YOU LIKE PEOPLE, TERRY?
WHAT I LIKE TO CALL IS POST OR PRE-POST AUTO BIOGRAPHICAL. PRE-POST-AUTO BIOGRAPHICAL. IS THAT ON THE ASPERGER'S SCALE? (LAUGHTER)
THERE YOU GO. AS A DIRECTOR, I HAVE TO IDENTIFY WITH MY MAIN CHARACTER. OTHER WISE, HOW CAN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. DURING THE MOVIE, WE LAUGHED A LOT AND MADE JOKES. IN THE END, I FOUND I HAD BECOME THE CHARACTER CHRISTOPH PLAYED SO BRILLIANTLY IN THE FILM. I LOVE MY COMPUTER. MY WIFE HAS BEGUN TO QUESTION MY SEXUALITY.
STEPHEN: THAT OUTFIT DOESN'T HELP. (LAUGHTER)
HER OSHKOSH DUNGAREES, WE BALANCE. I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR MEN TO DISCOVER THEIR FEMININITY AND WOMEN TO DISCOVER THEIR MASCULINITY. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT IF YOU'RE CONFIDENT.
STEPHEN: AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A SAFE WORD. PUMPKIN PATCH, TERRY. PUMPKIN PATCH.
I DON'T WANT TO PUSH YOU HERE.
STEPHEN: YOU'RE NOT PUSHING ME AT ALL., I'M UNPUSHABLE. MY CHI IS SO STRONG I CAN'T BE PUSHED.
THE POINT IS WILL YOU AND CAN YOU BE COMFORTABLE WEARING WOMEN'S CLOTHING?
STEPHEN: TERRY, I WISH I HAD TIME TO SHOW YOU. I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WEARING WOMEN'S CLOTHING.
811, TRIBECA GRAND HOTEL. TALK TO YOU LATER (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: TERRY GILLIAM, "THE ZERO THEOREM" OPENS TOMORROW! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
