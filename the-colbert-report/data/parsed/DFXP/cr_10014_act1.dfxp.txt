QUOTH THE RAVEN, NEVERMORE. AND MY GUEST TONIGHT IS FORMER TWO TERM POET LAUREATE OF THE UNITED STATES, BILLY COLLINS. I WILL ASK HIM IF HE'S MET THAT GUY FROM NANTUCKET.

Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. IN THERE, OUT THERE. ALL OVER THE WORLD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, FOLKS. I MEAN THIS SINCERELY. I WANT TO SEND OUT A GREETING TO ALL OF THE CANADIANS OUT THERE WAITING FOR SURGERY. PLEASE TAKE A NUMBER. PLEASE TAKE A NUMBER AND BITE ON A STICK OR SOMETHING. WHATEVER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW AND WATCHED FROM THE BEGINNING AND I HOPE YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW I DO THIS SHOW FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY, TO ROCKET PROPEL GRENADES OF TRUTH DOWN YOUR MIND THROAT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. OKAY?  THAT'S FOR YOU. BUT SOMETIMES THERE ARE A FEW PERKS FOR ME. MAYBE I WILL MENTION A PRODUCT ON THE AIR AND SAY, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING ABOUT THE REFRESHING TASTE OF BUD LIGHT LIME. AND, AND, AND, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SIMPLY IN THE COURSE OF REPORTING HARD NEWS, THE MAKERS SEND ME A CASE TO THIS OFFICE TO TRY TO BRIBE ME INTO DOING IT AGAIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: NOT GOING TO WORK, GUYS. KEEP TRYING. NOW, LAST WEEK, I BROUGHT THE HAMMER DOWN ON A GODLESS NEW TOMATO-POTATO HYBRID PLANT, AND MY ANGLE WENT A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
A VEGETABLE SHOULD NOT BE MATING WITH OTHER SPECIES, SPECIES, IT IS ADAM AND EVE, NOT ADAM AND ENDIVE.
I KNOW, STRONG WORDS BUT I FIGURED THE MOST THAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THE BLOGS WOULD LIGHT UP AND I WOULD WIN ANOTHER PEABODY. BUT OUT OF NOWHERE, THIS MORNING, I RECEIVED THIS ACTUAL LETTER FROM RICH COLLINS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ENDIVE FARMS. AMERICA'S ONLY ENDIVE GROWER AND IT READS, DEAR STEPHEN, I JUST WANTED TO SHARE HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR INSISTENCE ON GETTING THE PRONUNCIATION OF ENDIVE RIGHT. AND, AND -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: THE LETTER CAME WITH THIS ACTUAL BOX OF ENDIVE. ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT!  FREE ENDIVE MOTHER (BLEEP)!  MAKE IT RAIN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
OH, SUCK IT UP, SUCK IT UP!  SO, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: THANK YOU, CALIFORNIA ENDIVE FARMS. AND IN LIGHT OF THIS GENEROUS ATTEMPT AT PAYOLA, I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION IT IS ADAM AND EVE, NOT ADAM AND TESLA MODEL S IN METALLIC BLUE WITH PIANO BLACK INTERIOR AND 21-INCH TIRE UPGRADE.
IT HAS BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE AMERICA WAS DRIVEN TO FINANCIAL UIN BY, WELL, WHO CAN REMEMBER?  ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST SAY IT WAS OBAMA. PULL UP THE PRESIDENT SMILING IN FRONT OF A POOR FAMILY. YES. THAT FEELS RIGHT. THE POINT IS, IT WASN'T THE BANKS. NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR SAVINGS AND HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR THEIR RETIREMENT WITH THINGS LIKE REVERSE MORTGAGES WHERE IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH NOW, FRED THOMPSON GETS YOUR HOME WHEN YOU DIE. AND AS FAR AS I AM AWARE, HE IS NOT LEGALLY ALLOWED TO KILL YOU TO GET IT SOONER. THANK YOU, ELIZABETH WARREN. SO TIMES ARE TOUGH, IT IS TRUE BUT NOW WE HAVE BOUNCED BACK, IF BY "WE" I DON'T MEAN YOU, AND GENERALLY I DON'T, BECAUSE SINCE 2009, 95 PERCENT OF INCOME GAINS HAVE GONE TO THE TOP ONE PERCENT. SO THAT IS JUST WRONG. THE ONE PERCENT SHOULD GET 99 PERCENT. THAT ADDS UP TO 100. WHERE IS THE MISSING FOUR PERCENT?  I BET THE POOR TOOK IT, YOU KNOW THEY STEAL. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, WE KNOW THERE ARE MORE TAKERS EVERY DAY. MATCHERS, WHO ARE MAKING OFF OF US MAKERS.
60 MILLIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.
ONE OUT OF EVERY SEVEN AMERICANS RECEIVE FOOD STAMPS.
IT HAS GONE UP 11,000 PERCENT.
I AM CONCERNED.
YES, ENTITLEMENTS ARE NARCOTICS. YOU HAVE GOT FOOD STAMP JUNKIES RIDING THE MEAL PONY TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY. SOMETIMES THE FIRST THING THEY DO IN THE MORNING IS WAKE AND BAKE. BUT THERE IS A WAY, THERE IS A TRIED AND TRUE WAY FOR THE MOOCHERS TO PAY THE BILLS WITHOUT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT AND IT IS THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S WORD. .. FOLKS, WHEN WE DO GET THIS COUNTRY BACK ON ITS FEET, YOU WILL BE THANKFUL INDUSTRIOUS AMERICANS LIKE 35-YEAR-OLD ATLANTA MOTHER OF TWO, APRIL HARE, AFTER LOSING HER JOB AS A SALES MANAGER AND FACING EVICTION, APRIL POSTED PICTURES OF HER 18-INCH LONG AUBURN HAIR ON BUY AND SELL HAIR.COM. THE APRIL AD ASKS FOR $1,000, AND WITHIN HOURS RECEIVED A FLOOD OF OFFERS. NOW, FOLKS, I HAVE NO IDEA, I HAVE NO IDEA WHO OUT THERE PAID SO MUCH FOR LONG AUBURN HAIR ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOTICED SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT JIM CRAMER LATELY.
APRIL, APRIL IS PART OF A GROWING NEW TREND OF CASH STRAPPED AMERICANS MAKING ENDS MEET BY SELLING THEIR HAIR, BREAST MILK AND EGGS.
FOLKS, THIS IS GOOD OLD-FASHIONED SELF-RELIANCE. I SAY WHY SUCKLE AT UNCLE SAM'S TEAT WHEN YOU CAN SUCK ON YOUR OWN TEAT. AND WE IN THE TOP ONE PERCENT ARE ROLLING IN THE DOUGH, IT IS NOTHING FOR US TO PAY UP TO $5 AN OUNCE FOR YOUR BREAST MILK AND $7,000 FOR YOUR EGGS. AND IF YOU ARE EVICTED YOU CAN LABEL THEM FREE RANGE. AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE, FOLKS, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WANT TO GET IN ON THE ACTION. IN FACT, WHEN YOU GOOGLE I WANT TO SELL MY -- ONE OF THE TOP SUGGESTIONS IS KIDNEYS. BUT, OF COURSE, BIG GOVERNMENT IS KEEPING SELF MOTIVATED AMERICANS FROM STRIPPING THEMSELVES FOR PARTS LIKE A STOLEN CAMARO. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH, EVEN THOUGH IT CAN FETCH $15,000 ON THE BLACK MARKET, IT IS ILLEGAL TO SELL A KIDNEY. I MEAN, JUST THINK ABOUT IT. $15,000 IS ENOUGH TO TAKE A FEW MONTHS OFF WORK, WHICH YOU WILL NEED TO RECOVER FROM AN UNLICENSED STRANGER OPERATING ON YOU WITH AN EXACTO KNIFE AND BARBECUE TONGS. NOW, BETTER YET, BETTER YET, WHY NOT MAKE 40 GRAND AND SELL BOTH KIDNEYS. IF YOU INSIST ON FILTERING YOUR BLOOD, JUST JAM A COUPLE OF BRITA FILTERS IN THERE. NOW, REMEMBER, IT IS ALL TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN SUPPORT YOURSELF IN YOUR RETIREMENT, DURING WHICH YOU WILL NOT BE RETIRED, BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF MIDDLE INCOME AMERICANS SAY THEY WILL HAVE TO WORK UNTIL THEY DIE WHICH OF COURSE WILL MAKE THIS VERY DISTURBING WAL-MART GREETERS. NOW, FOLKS, PERSONALLY, I DON'T THINK AMERICANS WORKING UNTIL THEY ARE DEAD IS RIGHT. CAN'T THEY WORK UNTIL AFTER THEY ARE DEAD?  I MEAN, IF PEOPLE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: IF PEOPLE OUT THERE -- THINK ABOUT THIS, FOLKS, IF PEOPLE PAID THAT MUCH FOR KIDNEYS, THAT MEANS AMERICANS HAVE A LOT OF EQUITY IN THEIR GUT. SO WHY NOT, WHY NOT CONSIDER A REVERSE MORTGAGE ON YOUR ENTIRE BODY. WE IN THE ONE PERCENT WILL GIVE YOU POOR PEOPLE GUARANTEED MONTHLY PAYMENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR FIRST DIBS ON YOUR VITAL ORGANS WHEN YOU KICK IT. YOU WILL GET CASH NOW AND WE WILL EVEN LET YOU STAY IN YOUR BODY UNTIL YOU DIE. JUST MAKE SURE -- JUST MAKE SURE YOU MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF THAT TICKER, I MIGHT HAVE TO REPOSSESS IT. SO, PLEASE, AVOID STRESS WHILE WORKING YOUR TWO JOBS AND HARVESTING YOUR HAIR TO PAY THE RENT. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE GET A MASSAGE. BECAUSE, FOLKS, THIS COUNTRY WILL ONLY BE GREAT AGAIN IF AVERAGE AMERICANS STOP ASKING FOR HANDOUTS AND PULL THEMSELVES UP BY THEIR OWN BOOT STRAPS. BY WHICH I MEAN SELLING THEIR ACHILLES' TENDONS, BECAUSE I TORE MINE PLAYING SQUASH. AND THAT IS THE WORD. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >>
