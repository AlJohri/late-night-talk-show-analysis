Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH! COME ON! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN").
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I NEED THAT KIND OF PRAISE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I NEED THAT KIND OF PRAISE BECAUSE I AM FURIOUS! AND NO AMOUNT OF YOUR APPLAUSE WILL CHANGE MY MOOD. SO DON'T EVEN TRY IT AGAIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? SORRY. NO, NO. ACTUALLY, ACTUALLY -- I WAS WRONG, THAT WORKED. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT, JIM? YOU BETTER MAKE ME MAD AGAIN.
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HAVE AGREED TO A NEW BUDGET DEAL. THE PACT IS SUPPOSED TO ELIMINATE THE CONTINUOUS CYCLE OF STANDOFF AND GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THREATS. THEY'RE CALLING IT THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2013.
THEY ACTUALLY PASSED A BUDGET. I MEAN, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO APPLAUD THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE. BUT IT'S A GOOD THING. THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING THEIR JOB.
Stephen: WRONG! IT IS NOT A GOOD THING AND THEY ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB. AMERICANS SENT REPUBLICANS TO WASHINGTON TO ACCOMPLISH ONE THING: ZERO THINGS. (LAUGHTER) BUT WITH THIS BIPARTISAN BUDGET WE'LL HAVE NO CHANCE OF ANOTHER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN FOR TWO WHOLE YEARS! YOU FOOLS! WE CAN'T LEAVE OUR NATIONAL PARKS OPEN THAT LONG! IT WILL GIVE THE WOLVES TIME TO UNIONIZE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT I DON'T GET HERE IS THAT THERE WERE PLENTY OF GOOD CONSERVATIVE BUDGET PLANS OUT THERE!
THE PENNY PLAN IS YOU DROP A PENNY OUT OF EVERY DOLLAR WASHINGTON SPENDS EVERY YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS. ONE PENNY IN EVERY DOLLAR FOR FIVE STRAIGHT YEARS. EVERYBODY. ACROSS THE BOARD. THIS IS THE BUDGET, LIVE WITH IT. NOW THAT'S -- IMPLIES DISCIPLINE.
Stephen: YES, THE PENNY PLAN IMPLIES DISCIPLINE. JUST AS STU VARNEY'S ACCENT IMPLIES INTELLIGENCE. (LAUGHTER) IN FACT, I TELL YOU WHAT, FOLKS. I'VE GOTTEN A EVEN BETTER PENNY PLAN FOR YOU. YOU JUST FILL A JAR WITH PENNIES AND WHICH EVER GOVERNMENT AGENCY CAN GUESS HOW MANY THERE ARE WINS THE JAR, WHICH IS NOW THEIR BUDGET. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EIGHT. AND WHAT REALLY HURTS IS WHO STABBED US IN THE FISCAL BACK. REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN AND REAGAN TRIBUTE SCALP PAUL RYAN. JUST LISTEN TO THE LAME WAY HE DEFENDS HIMSELF FROM REAL CONSERVATIVES.
MARCO RUBIO SAID THIS, THOUGH, LAST NIGHT. "YOUR DEAL IS GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR AMERICANS TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM." WHAT WILL YOU SAY TO MARCO?
READ THE DEAL AND GET BACK TO ME.
Stephen: "READ THE DEAL AND GET BACK TO ME"? THE GALL. LISTEN, BUDDY, I DON'T HAVE TO READ A BIPARTISAN BUDGET TO KNOW I DESPISE IT ANY MORE THAN I NEED TO READ "HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON" TO KNOW THAT IT ENDS WITH HAROLD COMING OUT AS A LESBIAN. (LAUGHTER) OKAY? IT'S ALL ABOUT BOUNDLESS IMAGINATION, ALSO KNOWN AS SCISSORING. (AUDIENCE REACTS) SO IF YOU EXCUSE ME, THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO. OKAY? I CAN'T BELIEVE I -- I CAN'T BELIEVE I -- (LAUGHTER). I CAN'T BELIEVE I HUNG THIS POSTER ON THE CEILING OF MY DREAM CLOSET. I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR A NEW 2016 FANTASY CANDIDATE. OH, TED CRUZ. (LAUGHTER) OH, TED CRUZ, YOU'LL NEVER BETRAY ME. OH, TED, HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING OUT? NATION, GROWING UP, FOLKS, WHEN I GOT A COLD THERE WAS NOTHING MORE COMFORTING THAN A BIG BOWL OF MY GRANDMA'S CHICKEN SOUP. SHE PUT A TON OF MORPHINE IN IT. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS CHEATING DEATH WITH DR. STEPHEN T. COLBERT D.F.A. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES, SIR, YES, SIR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AS ALWAYS, FOLKS, "CHEATING DEATH" IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS. PRESCOTT. YOU CAN CHEMICALLY DEPEND ON US. (LAUGHTER) FIRST UP, SLEEP HEALTH. FOLKS, A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP IS THE BEST WAY TO NATURALLY RESTORE YOU WHICH IS WHY IT TAKES POWERFUL CHEMICALS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. CHEMICALS LIKE AMBIEN. BUT EARLIER THIS YEAR WE GOT NEWS THAT WAS A REAL EYE OPENER-- UNLESS YOU'RE ON AMBIEN.
NOW A WARNING FOR PEOPLE WHO TAKE AMBIEN. A GOVERNMENT REPORT OUT THIS MORNING REVEALS DANGEROUS SIDE EFFECTS LIKE HALLUCINATIONS, BEHAVIORAL CHANGES, THINGS LIKE AGITATION, SLEEP DRIVING, SLEEP WALKING, SLEEP EATING WHERE YOU'RE IN THIS SORT OF HALF STATE OF SLEEP BUT YOU'RE ALSO AWAKE AND FUNCTIONING.
Stephen: HEY, THAT'S JUST WHAT I CALL MULTITASKING. (LAUGHTER) YOU CAN GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP WHILE STILL DRIVING TO WORK EATING A WHOLE BOX OF BROWNIE MIX. (LAUGHTER) BUT FOR PATIENTS OUT THERE WHO PREFER WAKING UP NOT WANDERING THROUGH THE NEXT COUNTY, THERE'S A NEW ALTERNATIVE. IT'S CALLED SUVOREXANT, MERCK'S SLEEP DRUG CURRENTLY SEEKING APPROVAL FROM THE F.D.A. WHICH IS INSPIRED BY RESEARCH ON NARCOLEPTIC DOGS, WHICH IS IS IMPORTANT WORK BECAUSE NOTHING HURTS YOUR SELF-ESTEEM LIKE A DOG FALLING ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF HUMPING YOUR LEG. (LAUGHTER) BUT, FOLKS, SUVOREXANT IS EFFECTIVE WITHOUT AMBIEN'S TROUBLING SIDE EFFECTS BECAUSE IT HAS EXCITING NEW SIDE EFFECTS. ONE PATIENT HAD A FEELING AS IF SHOCKED, THEN FELT PARALYZED AND HEARD VIVID SOUNDS OF PEOPLE COMING UP THE STAIRS WITH A SENSE OF VIOLENT INTENT AND ANOTHER HAD A FEELING OF SHADOWS FALLING OVER HIS BODY HUNTED BY ENEMIES HEARING EXTREMELY LOUD SCREAMS. (LAUGHTER) NOW, OF COURSE, THE EASIEST THING TO DO WOULD BE JUST LABEL THE BOTTLE "WARNING, MAY CAUSE SUDDEN ON SET KAFKA." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT INSTEAD, THE F.D.A. TOLD MERCK TO DROP THE SUGGESTED DOSAGE DRAMATICALLY FROM 80 MILLIGRAMS TO 10 MILLIGRAMS. UNFORTUNATELY, AT THAT LEVEL PATIENTS RECORDED IT HAD NO ADVANTAGE OVER A PLACEBO. WELL, THE FOLKS AT PRESCOTT BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE PUTTING A BUREAUCRAT BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR INESCAPABLE NIGHTMARES. THAT'S WHY WE ARE PROUD TO INTRODUCE VAXA-NUFF. A THREE-POUND BRICK OF PURE SLEEP AID. YOU CHOOSE YOUR OWN DOSE BY GRATING OFF AS MUCH AS -- AS DOCTOR YOU PRESCRIBES. (LAUGHTER) WHEN YOU FEEL YOURSELF DRIFTING GENTLY OFF TO SLEEP, YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH. WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE SOMEONE ELSE'S HAND IS DOING THE GRATING AND YOU'RE NO LONGER YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU ARE THE BRICK OF VAXA-NUFF BEING GRATEED INTO THE MOUTH OF A STRANGER THAT WAS ONCE YOU AND THE UNIVERSE FOLDS IN ON ITSELF AND TRANSFORMS INTO A SWARM OF BABY-FACED VAMPIRE BATS, YOU'VE HAD WAY TOO MUCH. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) SO AT WHICH POINT YOU'LL WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE MORE. BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SLEEP FOR WHATEVER YOU DO NEXT. SIDE EFFECTS OF VAXA-NUFF MAY INCLUDE SLEEP WALTZING, NIGHT TERRIERS AND NOCTURNAL MUNITIONS. (LAUGHTER) NEXT UP, FOLKS, COSMETIC SURGERY.
UH-HUH! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: FOLKS, I'M A BIG FAN OF COSMETIC SURGERY. OF COURSE, I DON'T NEED IT MYSELF BECAUSE I HAVE ALL OF THAT TAKEN CARE OF FOR ME BY THE PAINTING IN MY ATTIC. (LAUGHTER) STILL, I WAS EXCITED TO HEAR A NEW WAY TO IMPROVE A PART OF THE BODY I DIDN'T KNOW WAS HIDEOUS.
IT'S AN EYE OPENING PROCEDURE BEING DONE HERE IN NEW YORK FOR THE FIRST TIME. A WOMAN IS GETTING A PIECE OF PLATINUM JEWELRY PLACED IN HER EYE. DR. EMILE CHIN BEGINS THE PROCESS WITH AN INJECTION OF LIDOCAINE TO NUMBER T AREA. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
NOW I'M GOING TO PUT IN THE SPECULUM TO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.
THEN DR. CHIN MAKES A SMALL INCISION WHERE THE JEWELRY WILL EVENTUALLY BE PLACED.
Stephen: NOW, THE PROCEDURE MAY SOUND PAINFUL BUT REMEMBER BEFORE THEY SLICE YOUR EYE AND INSERT A PIECE OF METAL THEY NUMB IT BY JAMMING IN A NEEDLE. (LAUGHTER) NOW, THIS PATIENT OPTED FOR A LITTLE HEART. YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE HER EYE DIDN'T USED TO BE BLEEDING. (LAUGHTER) BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE PROCEDURE.
DR. CHIN SAYS HE BELIEVES IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SAFE.
Stephen: SEE? IT'S PRETTY SAFE! (LAUGHTER) THERE ARE SOME RISKS WITH ANY SURGERY, BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE-- NOT HAVING METAL IN YOUR EYE? OF COURSE, SURPRISE, SURPRISE, THE PROCEDURE HAS NOT BEEN F.D.A. APPROVED. WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO THROW AROUND THE PHRASE "NOT F.D.A. APPROVED" VERY LONG BEFORE THE FOLKS AT PRESCOTT TAKE NOTICE. FORGET COSTLY PROCEDURES TO PUT JEWELRY IN YOUR EYE. AT PRESCOTT WE BELIEVE TRUE BEAUTY LIES ON THE INSIDE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROUD TO INTRODUCE VACSA-BLING, JEWELRY FOR YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS. IT'S SIMPLY COMBINING AN ANATOMY TEXTBOOK WITH A ZALES CATALOG. JUST OPEN EACH TO A RANDOM PAGE AND WE'LL PUT THE THING IN THE OTHER THING. (LAUGHTER) SO THIS CHRISTMAS, TREAT YOURSELF TO DIAMOND PENDANT EARRINGS IN YOUR TESTICLES. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SIDE EFFECTS OF VACSA-BLING INCLUDE CREAMED CORNEAS, DOUBLE VISION, AND IDRIS ELBOW. WELL, THAT'S IT FOR CHEATING DEATH BROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS. REMEMBER: ABUSE ONLY AS DIRECTED. UNTIL NEXT TIME, I'LL SEE YOU IN
