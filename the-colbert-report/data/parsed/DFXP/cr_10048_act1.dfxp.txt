Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
WHOOO! WHOOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. FOLKS, AS YOU KNOW, IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW THEN YOU KNOW I AM A HUGE FAN OF THE HEROES THAT WORK AT THE NSA. THEY HAVE KEPT AMERICA SAFE. IN FACT, THANKS TO THEM SO FAR THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANOTHER SEPTEMBER 11th, 2001 IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,  CHECK YOUR CALENDARS. A RECENT STUDY BY THE NONPARTISAN NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION BACKS ME UP.
A NEW ANALYSIS OF 225 INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO AL QAEDA AND CHARGED WITH TERRORISM SINCE SEPTEMBER 11TH SAYS NSA BULK SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS QUOTE HAD NO DISCERNIBLE IMPACT ON PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM.
Stephen: SEE? (LAUGHTER) I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE LIKE EDWARD SNOWDEN ARE SO MAD ABOUT. IS VIOLATING EVERYONE'S PRIVACY REALLY THAT BAD IF IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK? (LAUGHTER) BESIDES, IT DOES NOT HAVE TO WORK. IT JUST HAS TO FEEL LIKE IT'S WORKING. BECAUSE OF WHAT DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE JAMES CLAPPER CALLS THE PEACE OF MIND METRIC. NOW FOLKS, I GET THAT. NSA SURVEILLANCE IS JUST LIKE THE HANDFUL OF PLACEBO SUGAR PILLS I TAKE EVERY MORNING. TO PREVENT CANINE HIP DISPLASIA. SO FAR SO GOOD. THOUGH I HAVE DEVELOPED TYPE II DIABETES. (LAUGHTER) MAYBE I'M NOT TAKING ENOUGH SUGAR PILLS.  BUT IF THIS MASSIVE DATA COLLECTION ISN'T WORKING, FOLKS, I SAY THE NSA NEEDS TO SPY HARDER. AND THANKFULLY THEY ARE.
NEW ALLEGATIONS THIS MORNING THAT THE NSA HAS PLACED SOFTWARE ON NEARLY 100,000 COMPUTERS WORLDWIDE SO IT CAN SNOOP WHEN THOSE MACHINES ARE NOT LINKED TO THE INTERNET.
MANY OF THESE TRANSMITTERS ARE IMPLANTED IN THE COMPUTERS AT MANUFACTURING. BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE IMPLANTED IN THE PLUG-INS FOR THE USB CORDS, THE SAME KIND OF USB CORDS THAT MANY OF YOU USE EVERY DAY.
THEY'VE GOT TRANSMITTERS IN OUR USB CORDS. I'M GUESSING THAT'S WHY THE FIRST TIME YOU TRY TO PLUG IT IN ITS'S ALWAYS THE WRONG WAY. (LAUGHTER) NOW FOLKS, FOLKS, I MADE IT CLEAR THAT I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE NSA'S UNLIMITED SNOOPING ABILITY ON OTHER PEOPLE. PERSONALLY I PROTECT MY MOST PRIVATE DATA BY KEEPING IT ON A 1982 ATARI 800. NOT ONLY IS IT NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET, IT IS POWERED BY WHALE OIL. (LAUGHTER) BUT NOW THAT I KNOW THAT THE NSA CAN JUST PUT A TRANSMITTER ANYWHERE, I AM GOING OFF THE GRID. THAT MEANS I'M LOSING MY LAPTOP, GETTING RID OF MY PHONE, MY TV, MY CAR, ANYTHING WITH A COMPUTER IN IT. I THINK I'LL MISS MY MAGIC EIGHT BALL MOST OF ALL. AND FROM NOW ON I'LL JUST MANAGE MY INFORMATION THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, WITH A PEN. ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. OKAY, PEN, WRITE A TWEET. SORRY, AMERICA, GOING OFF THE GRID. TO DODGE NSA #CATCHMEIFYOUCAN AND TWEET. WELL, I BELIEVE I'VE EARNED MYSELF A BREAK. PEN? SHOW ME NAKED PICTURES. WOW. WOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE) THAT IS SOME SICK STUFF. YOU KNOW WHAT, I BETTER DELETE HISTORY. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. AND PUT IN TRASH. NATION, YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING, A FOOL AND HIS MONEY ARE SOON, TO HEAR THE REST OF THIS QUOTE SEND $20 TO STEPHENCOLBERT@SOONPARTED.COM. THIS IS COLBERT PLATINUM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) A QUICK REMINDER, FOLKS,  THIS SEGMENT IS FOR PLATINUM MEMBERS ONLY. SO IF YOUR COFFEEMAKER IS A MACHINE INSTEAD OF A SMALL COUNTERTOP COLUMBIAN MAN, WHY DON'T YOU RUN ALONG AND GET ANOTHER THAT TATTOO OF A WARNER BROTHER'S CHARACTER. FOGHORN LEGHORN REALLY STICKS IT TO THE MAN. ARE THEY GONE?
GOOD OKAY. FIRST UP, FOLKS, WE PLATINUM PARENTS LOVE OUR CHILDREN JUST AS MUCH AS THE DIRT EATERS OUT THERE. AND WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE PLATINUM LIFESTYLE EARLY. THAT'S WHY A COMPANY CALLED KALFIN JEWELRY HAS CREATED A 50,000 DOLLAR DIAMOND ENCRUSTED  PACIFIER. FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT COMBINES TWO THINGS I LOVE, QUIET BABIES AND EXPLOITING THE CONGO. AND THIS GIFT JUST KEEPS ON GIVING, FOLKS. BECAUSE REMEMBER, ONCE YOUR CHILD'S TEETH COME IN, YOU CAN HAVE THE PACIFIER MADE INTO A TODDLER GRILL. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, A DIAMOND PACIFIER IS GREAT BUT THE TRULY WEALTHY START THEIR BABY'S PREMIUM TRAINING IN UTERO. I MEAN NINE MONTHS IN ONE PLACE? THAT'S NOT HOW THE RICH ROLL. TIME TO GET YOUR FETUS A SECOND UTERUS IN ST. BARTS. NEXT UP, EVERYBODY, THERE'S A REAL FROOFERAH BREWING OVER INCOME INEQUALITY, EVEN THOUGH WE RICH ARE ALREADY DOING OUR BEST TO TRICKLE OUR MONEY DOWN. BUT THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY $50,000 PACIFIERS YOU CAN BUY BEFORE YOU START LOOKING LIKE AN ASS [BLEEP].  BUT THE UNGRATEFUL, UNWASHED  MASSES ARE STILL UNHAPPY. IF WE DON'T FIND A WAY TO SPEND IT FASTER, WE MAY HAVE A REVOLUTION ON OUR HANDS AND I JUST GOT A MANICURE. THANKFULLY, ONE WELL-HEELED HORN DOG MAY HAVE FOUND A SOLUTION BY BIDDING $42,000 FOR A ONE-HOUR PRIVATE WEB CAM SHOW WITH A DOMINATRIX NAMED MAITRESSE MADELINE. NOW $42,000 IS PRETTY STEEP FOR A DOMINATRIX. THE BALL GAG BETTER BE A FABERGE EGG BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THE DOMINATRIX'S WEB SITE IS PART OF A SEXUAL SUBCULTURE CALLED FINDOM WHICH DOES NOT AS I ORIGINALLY SUSPECTED INVOLVE GETTING WHIPPED WITH A   RAINBOW TROUT. NO, FINDOM STANDS FOR FINANCIAL DOMINATION, A FETISH IN WHICH SOMEONE IS SEXUALLY AROUSED BY THE THOUGHT OF SENDING SOMEONE ELSE MONEY AND GIFTS EXPECTING NO SEXUAL FAVORS IN RETURN. NOTHING IN RETURN FOR YOUR MONEY. IT BREAKS ALL THE RULES OF CAPITALISM. IT'S SO NAUGHTY, YOU DESERVE TO GET SPANKED BY THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET. NOW THE FINDOM COMMUNITY EVEN HAS ITS OWN LINGO WHERE GIFTS AND MONEY ARE KNOWN AS TRIBUTES AND THE MEN WHO SEND THEM ARE REFERRED TO AS PAY PIGS. SO GOOD NEWS, OCCUPY WALL STREET, THOSE NAMES YOU YELLED IN RAGE WERE HEARD BY THE RICH. THE BAD NEWS, IT GAVE THEM A BONER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
