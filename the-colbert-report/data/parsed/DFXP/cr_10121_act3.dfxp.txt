[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUESTS TONIGHT HAVE A NEW BOOK ABOUT IMPROVING WOMEN'S CONFIDENCE. STEP ONE: WRITE A BOOK THAT GETS YOU ON MY SHOW. PLEASE WELCOME KATTY KAY AND CLAIRE SHIPMAN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] KATTY, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. CLAIRE, THANKS FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING US.
Stephen: I'M A LITTLE OUTNUMBERED.
THAT'S THE WAY WE LIKE IT.
Stephen: LET'S GET THIS THING DONE HERE. KATTY, YOU'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW BEFORE. CLAIRE, YOU'RE A LONGTIME CORRESPONDENT FOR ABC NEWS AND "GOOD MORNING AMERICA." KATTY, YOU'RE AN ANCHOR FOR BBC WORLD NEWS AMERICA. AND YOU TWO HAVE WRITTEN A NEW BOOK CALLED "THE CONFIDENCE CODE: THE SCIENCE AND ART OF SELF-ASSURANCE - WHAT WOMEN SHOULD KNOW". WHY DO WOMEN NEED A BOOK TO TEACH THEM TO BE CONFIDENT? ISN'T NEEDING A BOOK NEEDY?
IT IS.
Stephen: SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE THE CONFIDENCE? I WANT TO SELL SOME BOOKS, DON'T GET ME WRONG, WE'RE GOING TO SELL SOME BOOKS, BUT DOESN'T THE ACT OF BUYING THE BOOK SEEM LIKE YOU'RE NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH DO IT BY YOURSELF?
ABSOLUTELY. WOMEN AT WORK DON'T FEEL AS CONFIDENT AS MEN DO OFTEN. IT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN WAYS THAT HAVE LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON OUR CAREERS. FOR EXAMPLE, WOMEN TEND TO APPLY FOR PROMOTIONS OR  JOBS WHEN WE FEEL WE HAVE 100% OF THE QUALIFICATIONS. MEN, THIS MAY SURPRISE YOU, WILL DO IT WHEN THEY FEEL THEY HAVE 60% OF THE QUALIFICATIONS. SO YOU CAN  IMAGINE WHAT THAT MEANS OVER THE COURSE OF A CAREER.
Stephen: WE WING IT.
YOU WING IT.
Stephen: MEN WING IT. WHY DON'T WOMEN HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THEY NEED? WHY DON'T THEY JUST GROW A PAIR. THAT'S MY BOOK. "GROWING A PAIR: WOMANHOOD THE COLBERT WAY."
IT WORKS FOR YOU, BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK FOR MOST WOMEN. MEN ROUTINELY OVERESTIMATE THEIR ABILITIES BY SOME 30%. WOMEN TEND TO UNDERESTIMATE THEIR ABILITIES. WHAT WE'RE TRYING DO WITH THIS BOOK IS GET WOMEN'S PERCEPTION OF THEIR TALENT IN LINE WITH THEIR REAL TALENT. WOMEN HAVE PLENTY OF TALENT. WE JUST THINK THAT WE DON'T.
Stephen: WERE YOU ALWAYS CONFIDENT? FOR INSTANCE, WHY DID IT TAKE TWO OF DO YOU WRITE THE BOOK? DID YOU NOT HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO WRITE IT BY YOURSELVES?
YES, THAT'S RIGHT. WE HAVE TO TEAM UP.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND. IT'S LIKE GOING TO THE BATHROOM TOGETHER.
HOW DID HE KNOW ABOUT THAT?
CONFIDENCE IS PARTLY GENETIC. CLAIRE AND I FOR THE BOOK HAD OUR GENES TESTED.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
WE ARE NOT AT ALL CONFIDENT, GENETICALLY.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE GENE THAT SAYS THAT YOU'RE NOT CONFIDENT?
THIS MIGHT GET COMPLICATED. STICK WITH US. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GENES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CONFIDENCE. THERE'S NOT ONE CONFIDENCE GENE. THEY AFFECT THINGS, THE NEUROTRANSMITTERS IN OUR BRAIN LIKE SERATONIN, DOPAMINE, OXYTOCIN
Stephen: TESTOSTERONE. YOU GUYS SHOULD TRY SOME ANDROGEL.
RUB IT ALL OVER. YES, TESTOSTERONE IS A HUGE CONFIDENCE BOOST. UNFORTUNATELY, YOU MAY KNOW THIS, WOMEN DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OF THAT AS MEN, BUT TESTOSTERONE ENCOURAGES RISK TAKING, NOT ALWAYS GREAT RISK TAKING, ECONOMIES CAN COLLAPSE.  THERE'S A LITTLE TOO MUCH TESTOSTERONE ON WALL STREET.
Stephen: BUT IT'S A FUN RIDE ON THE WAY.
I THINK IF WOMEN COULD TAKE MORE ACTION, TAKE MORE RISKS, BE PREPARED TO FAIL, NOT BE SO PERFECT ALL THE TIME, WE'RE OBSESSED WITH BEING PERFECT, THAT CAN HOLD US BACK FROM BEING CONFIDENT. I THINK...
Stephen: IS THAT JUST HUBRIS THAT YOU THINK YOU'RE OBSESSED WITH BEING PERFECT?
WELL, WE ARE PERFECT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. DOES EVERYONE START OUT WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE AND THEN IT'S WHITTLED AWAY IN, YOU KNOW, IN A PROCESS THAT SCIENTISTS CALL MIDDLE SCHOOL? IS THERE... IS IT NATURE OR IT IS NURTURE?
SOME OF IT IS NATURE, SOME 25% IS WHAT WE'RE BORN WITH, THAT'S OUR D.N.A. AND SOME OF IT IS WHAT HAPPENS TO US IN SCHOOL, AND ACTUALLY, GIRLS ARE DOING GREAT IN SCHOOL. WE'RE GETTING STRAIGHT As. WE'RE COLORING IN  THE LINES AND KEEPING OUR HEADS DOWN AND DOING SUPER WELL. THEN WE LEAVE SCHOOL AND SOMEHOW THE RULES CHANGE.
Stephen: THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE CONFIDENCE CODE." YOU ALSO WROTE A COVER ARTICLE FOR "THE ATLANTIC" CALLED "THE CONFIDENCE GAP." WHICH IS IT, A CODE OR A GAP, AND DOES THE CONFIDENCE GAP HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE THIGH GAP?
WE'RE NOT GOING THERE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CODE? WHAT IS THE CODE?
WHAT IS THE CODE? SHOULD WE TELL HIM? I DON'T KNOW. ARE YOU READY?
Stephen: I'M READY. BY THE WAY, BEFORE WE GET TO THE CODE, THERE'S A TEST YOU CAN TAKE. YOU GO ONLINE AND TAKE THE TEST. AND ABOUT YOUR LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE. NOW, WILL THIS... I'M HESITANT TO TAKE THE TEST BECAUSE I'M AFRAID... I THINK I'M A MAN. I'M AFRAID I MIGHT FIND OUT FROM THE TEST THAT I'M JUST  AN EXTREMELY CONFIDENT WOMAN.
IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUND THAT OUT ALREADY, STEPHEN, THEN I'M NOT SURE WE CAN HELP YOU.
Stephen: I HAVE CHILD-BEARING HIPS.
HE'S TRYING TO GET BACK TO THE THIGHS AGAIN.
YES.
Stephen: FOR ANYONE OUT THERE WHO HAS DAUGHTERS, WHAT'S THE THING YOU CAN DO TO GIVE THEM THE GREATEST CONFIDENCE?
WE HAVE FOUND A COUPLE OF THINGS. NUMBER ONE, DO LET THEM FAIL. LET THEM RISK. DON'T LET THEM FOCUS ALL THE TIME ON GETTING A PERFECT SCORE ON EVERY TEST, TURNING IN ALL OF THEIR HOMEWORK ON TIME. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS COUNTERINTUITIVE, BUT WHEN THEY SAY, WHO CARES, LET THEM LEARN FROM THAT. LET THEM GO WITH THAT. SPORTS. SPORTS IS ALSO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR GIRLS.
Stephen: REALLY?
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, NOT JUST FOR BEING HEALTHY.
IT TEACHES US TO WIN, BUT ALSO TO LOSE. THAT BUSINESS OF FAILING AGAIN. YOU LOSE A GAME AND YOU REALIZE YOU HAVE TO CARRY ON PLAYING. YOU CAN'T LET YOUR TEAM DOWN. GET BACK OUT ON TO THE PITCH. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
Stephen: HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE A [BLEEPED] ARTIST? BECAUSE MEN ARE SUPREME BULL [BLEEPED] ARTISTS. IN TODAY'S "NEW YORK TIMES" THERE WAS A STUDY BY THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER THAT SAYS MALE POLITICIANS MORE OFTEN LIE IN STUMP SPEECHES, BUT THE AUDIENCE TENDS TO BELIEVE THEM MORE BECAUSE OF THE CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH THEY TELL THE STATISTICS ON THE STUMP SPEECH. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE. I JUST MADE THAT STUDY UP. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. KATTY KAY, CLAIRE SHIPMAN, "THE CONFIDENCE CODE." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
