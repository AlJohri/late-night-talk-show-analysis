Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, I LOVE NEW YORK CITY. PEOPLE ARE JUST-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LISTEN TO THAT. PEOPLE ARE SO FRIENDLY HERE. YOU CAN GO OUT ON THE STREET ANY DAY, STICK OUT YOUR ARM, AND SOMEONE WILL GIVE YOU A RIDE FOR FREE. AND THEN WHEN YOU GET OUT OF THE CAR, THEY SHOUT GOOD-BYE TO YOU IN THEIR STRANGE AND ANGRY LANGUAGE. BUT SADLY, NOWHERE IS BIG GOVERNMENT MORE INTRUSIVE THAN THE BIG APPLE. YOU THINK YOU CAN FORCE ME INTO ALTERNATE SIDE-OF-THE-STREET PARKING? GUESS WHAT, COPPERS? YOU CAN KEEP MY CAR, AND GOOD LUCK FINDING A PLACE TO PARK IT. WELL, NOW THE OVER-REACH HAS REACHED TOO OVER AS THE "NEW YORK POST" REPORTS, STATE LEGISLATORS HAVE PASSED A BILL BANNING PEOPLE FOR POSING FOR PHOTOS WHILE HUGGING, PATTING, OR OTHERWISE TOUCHING TIGERS. YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT-- NEW YORK WANTS TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO TAKE A TIGER SELFIE. A CLEAR INFRINGEMENT ON OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH. THAT SPEECH? THE FLASH IS OFF, RIGHT? OH, GOD NO! ALSO BEING DONE IN THE NAME OF INCREASING SAFETY AT TRAVELING CIRCUSES AND COUNTY FAIRS -- OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE WHO WANTS SAFETY AT THE COUNTY FAIR YOU GO THERE TO FILL UP ON FRIED NITRATES AND STRAP YOUR CHILDREN INTO A RIGHT OPERATED BY METH-ADDLED TEENS. YOU'D BE SAFER IF THE TIGER WAS RUNNING THE TILT-A-WHIRL. I HAVE BEEN WARNING YOU THIS WAS COMING SINCE 2010. MARK MY WORDS, FOLKS. FIRST THEY COME FOR YOUR FOUR LOCO NEXT THEY'LL BE BANNING PEOPLE FROM TAKING PHOTOS WHILE PATTING, HUGGING, OR OTHERWISE TOUCHING PANTHERS. SO CLOSE. SO CLOSE. I DON'T KNOW WHY-- ( APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW WHY I EVER LOST THAT BEARD. OF COURSE, THE BIGGEST VICTIMS OF THIS PLAN ARE, AS USUAL IN OBAMA'S AMERICA, GUYS TRYING TO GET LAID.
TIGER SELFIES A BIG TREND ON A DATING APP. IT IS A GROWING TREND ON SITES LIKE TINDER AND OK CUPID
Stephen:  OH YEAH, LADIES LOVE A MAN WHO CUDDLES UP WITH  BIG GAME CATS. IT SHOWS YOU'RE SPONTANEOUS AND DON'T OVER-THINK THINGS. NOW, HOW WILL GUYS SHOW THEY'RE FUN AND ADVENTUROUS ON  DATING SITES WITHOUT TIGER SELFIES? IT'S EITHER THAT OR PHOTOS OF YOU ROCK CLIMBING OR IF YOU'RE REALLY COOL, DOING BOTH. ( LAUGHTER ) IT IS ALREADY-- IT IS ALREADY HARD ENOUGH FOR GUYS TO LOOK COOL AND DANGEROUS IN NEW YORK AFTER MAYOR BLOOMBERG TOOK AWAY OUR CIGARETTES, TOOK AWAY OUR GUNS AND TOOK AWAY OUR BIG GULPS. LADIES, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT A GUY WITH A BIG GULP-- HE'S  ALSO PROBABLY GOT A BIG RISK OF DIABETES. AND LIKE IT OR NOT, FOLKS, LIKE IT OR NOT, TIGER SELFIES ARE NOT SOME PASSING FAD. IN FACT, TINDER USERS ESTIMATE THEY ENCOUNTER TIGERS IN  ONE OUT OF EVERY 10 PROFILES THEY VIEW-- ONE IN 10! I HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE THAT MANY TIGERS STILL LEFT OUT THERE. THAT'S ACTUALLY GREAT NEWS I'VE GOT TO IMAGINE THAT JUST MARKET FORCES, THE OBVIOUS BOON IN THE TIGER POPULATION IS BECAUSE THEY NOW SERVE SOME MARKETABLE PURPOSE. THIS IS HOW ENDANGERED SPECIES CAN SAVE THEMSELVES -- BY HELPING US GET LAID. SORRY, DODO, BUT YOUR TERRIBLE WINGS MADE YOU A TERRIBLE WINGMAN. YOU HAD TO GO. AND TONIGHT I'M CALLING ON THE BRO-MMUNITY TO PHOTOGRAPH THEMSELVES WITH AS MANY ENDANGERED SPECIES AS POSSIBLE TO FIND OUT IF THAT ANIMAL ATTRACTS WOMEN. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M TALKING ABOUT THE NOBLE SNOW LEOPARD. THE BREATH-TAKING BLUE WHALE. THE MAJESTIC SANTA CRUZ LONG-TOED SALAMANDER. I JUST HOPE WE'RE NOT TOO LATE TO SAVE THE WESTERN BLACK RHINO. BY THE WAY, THIS EPISODE OF THE THE "COLBERT REPORT" IS DEDICATED TO OUR FRIEND, PHIL HILDEBRAND. PAUL WORKED IN THE GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT, AND HE COULD HAVE JUST PHOTO SHOPPED THAT, BUT HE WANTED TO GET IT JUST RIGHT. AND-- AND BECAUSE I TOLD HIM TO. ( LAUGHTER ) I WANT HIS FAMILY TO KNOW THAT HE DIED WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) HE WILL BE MISSED. ( APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
