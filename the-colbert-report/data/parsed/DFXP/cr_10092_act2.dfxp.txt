Stephen: WELCOME BACK! THANKS SO MUCH FOLKS! FOLKS, I WANT TAKE A MOMENT TO WISH YOU ALL A HAPPY EARTH DAY! OF COURSE, AS EVERY YEAR, THIS MORNING I HEADED OUT TO GET MY TRADITIONAL EARTH DAY TREE. JUST WALKED INTO THE PARK AND CUT DOWN THE FIRST ONE I SAW. BUT DON'T WORRY TREE-HUGGERS. WHEN EARTH DAY IS OVER, I'LL RELEASE IT BACK INTO THE WILD. I FEEL ESPECIALLY CLOSE TO MOTHER EARTH ON THIS EARTH DAY, BECAUSE WE FINALLY HAVE PROOF OUR PLANET DOESN'T LIKE LIBERALS ANY MORE THAN I DO. NEWS THE GREENIES ARE NOT  GOING TO LIKE TODAY. A FEDERAL STUDY IS OUT, AND IT SHOWS COSTLY BIO-FUEL MADE FROM CORN IS ACTUALLY WORSE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE SHORT TERM THAN STRAIGHT-UP GASOLINE. LOOKS LIKE ETHANOL MAY NOT BE AS GREEN AS EVERYONE THOUGHT. ETHANOL MADE FROM CORN RESIDUE MAY ACTUALLY BE MORE HARMFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT. HA! HA! HARMFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT. TRYING TO HELP IS POINTLESS! YOU SEE, ACCORDING TO THE FIRST ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY, THAT I'VE ENJOYED READING, MAKING ETHANOL BY REMOVING CORN LEFTOVERS FROM THE FIELDS COULD ACTUALLY HURT THE ABILITY OF SOIL TO ABSORB CARBON DIOXIDE. AND ABSORBING CO2 IS CRUCIAL TO OUR PLANET'S HEALTH, BECAUSE THERE'S A 'TON' OF IT IN THE AIR FOR SOME REASON. THIS STUDY IS THE FINAL NAIL IN GREEN ENERGY'S BIODEGRADABLE COFFIN. TURNS OUT, EVERYTHING YOU THOUGHT WAS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IS BAD. WE ALREADY KNOW WIND POWER SEPARATES MIGRATING GEESE INTO BIRD PEPPERONI. SO IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE WE LEARN THAT SOLAR POWER RELIES ON CLUBBING BABY SEALS, BECAUSE THOSE SHINY PANELS ARE MADE FROM THE GLEAM IN THEIR EYES. IT'S TIME TO FORGET ABOUT GREEN ENERGY AND DOUBLE DOWN ON BLACK ENERGY. THIS IS THE EARTH DAY WHEN WE TAKE OUR PLANET BACK FROM THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS. FORGET PLANTING TREES OR PICKING UP LITTER. WE SHOULD ALL CELEBRATE LIKE FOX NEWS HOST ERIC BOLLING. JIM?
IT'S AN ANNUAL EVENT. IN MY HOUSEHOLD, WE OPEN ALL THE WINDOWS AND TURN UP THE HEAT OR THE AIR CONDITIONING, WHICHEVER IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHATEVER THE TEMPERATURE IS OUTSIDE AND I. SPARK UP THE 90,000 BTU BARBECUE AND COOK SOME STEAKS.
WAY TO STICK IT TO THE GREENIES, ERIC! MAN, I'D HATE TO BE THE DUMBASS WHO HAS TO PAY THIS GUY'S UTILITY BILLS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
