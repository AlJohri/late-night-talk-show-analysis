Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, NATION, I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE, YOU KNOW IT-- FOLKS, OPINIONS ARE LIKE A-HOLES, IN THAT MINE IS THE BEST. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST UP, FOLKS, SOME SCARY NEWS OUT OF POLAND WHERE A PRIEST CLAIMS TO BE RECEIVING TEXT MESSAGES FROM THE DEVIL AFTER PERFORMING AN EXORCISM ON A POLISH GIRL CAUSING SATAN TO POSSESS HER MOBILE PHONE. I GOT TO SAY SATAN USING CELL PHONES DOES MAKE SENSE, THOUGH SATAN'S CONTRACTS ARE SLIGHTLY EASIER TO GET OUT OF. I THINK WE'VE ALL WOKEN UP AFTER A NIGHT OF DRINKING AND FOUND OUR PHONE SENT SOME TEXTS THAT COULD ONLY BE THE WORK OF THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS. AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE GOT PHOTOS OF MY GROIN, CHARLENE. SO I GOT TO GIVE A RELUCTANT WAG OF MY FINGER TO BEELZEBUB FOR PHONING THIS ONE IN, COME ON YOU ARE THE PRINCE OF LIE, THE INCARNATIONS OF ALL EVIL, THE SULTAN OF SWAT. AND THIS IS THE BEST YOU CAN DO? I KNOW SLOTH IS A DEADLY SIN BUT POSSESSING A CELL PHONE IS JUST DAMN LAZY. IS POSSESSING SOMEONE FACE-TO-FACE JUST TOO MUCH EFFORT FOR TODAY'S MILLENNIAL DEMONS? WHATEVER HAPPENED IT TO A LITTLE HUMAN DEVIL CONTACT. IN MY DAY THIS IS WHAT POSSESSION WAS. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, SEND AN EMOJI FOR  PROJECTILE VOMIT? AND THEN TEXT ROFTMHO FOR ROLLING ON THE FLOOR TWISTING MY HEAD OFF? BUT FOR ANYONE OUT THERE WHO SUSPECTS THEIR SMART PHONE MIGHT BE IN NEED OF TEXT-ORCISM, DO NOT TAKE IT TO THE GENIUS BAR. YOU WILL BE THERE FOR AN ETERNITY. (LAUGHTER) STAY TUNED FOR MORE OF THE TIP WAG POWER HOUR COMING UP RIGHT AFTER THIS SENTENCE. NEXT UP ON TIP WAG EVERYONE KNOWS NASA HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS. THE BUDGETS WERE BIGGER, THE GOALS WERE HIGHER, EVERYONE LOOKED LIKE ED HARRIS. NOW OUR SPACE PROGRAM IS GUTTED. BUT LIKE THE CREW OF APOLLO 13 I HAVE NEVER LOST HOPE AND I STORE MY URINE IN BAGS. WELL, OVER THE WEEKEND, FOLKS, AMERICA FINALLY GOT SOME GOOD NASA NEWS.
NASA'S SPACE ROVER ON MARS MAKING SOME NEWS OF ITS OWN ON SUNDAY DRIVING 25 MILES, SETTING A NEW RECORD FOR THE LONGEST OFF-EARTH DRIVING DISTANCE SINCE IT ARRIVED IN MARS IN 2004.
Stephen: WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO NASA FOR THEIR FEAT OF OFF PLANET ROAD OFF-ROADING. THAT'S QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT, FOLKS. BECAUSE AS THE ROVER'S PROJECT MANAGER SAID, OPPORTUNITY WAS ONLY INTENDED TO DRIVE ABOUT ONE KILOMETER. SO BASICALLY ABOUT AS MUCH AS A CHEVY COBALT. BUT WHAT REALLY HAS ME EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW RECORD IS THE RECORD IT BROKE WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BY THE SOVIET UNION'S REMOTE CONTROLLED LUNOKHOD 2 ROVER WHICH COVERED 24.2 MILES ON THE MOON BACK IN 1973. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY OPPORTUNITY USED ITS 25 MILES OF TIRE TRACKS TO SPELL OUT SUCK IT, VLAD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
