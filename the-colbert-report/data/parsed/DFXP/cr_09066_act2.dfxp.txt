Stephen: WELCOME BACK. THANKS VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, AS YOU MAY KNOW, ON  THURSDAY POPE BENEDICT WILL BE  STEPPING DOWN. AND AS TELEVISION'S FOREMOST  ROMAN CATHOLIC I'LL HAVE FULL  COVERAGE OF THIS STORY IN POPE WATCH:  2013678 I'LL BE ON THE  GROUND LIVE FROM ROME TO COVER  THE STORY UP CLOSE AND PAPAL. THIS WEDNESDAY IL PAPA WILL GIVE  HIS LAST PUBLIC AUDIENCE AND  CIRCLE ST. PETER'S SQUARE IN THE POPE NOBLE SALUTE THE ENORMOUS  CROWD. NATURALLY, THE JACKALS IN THE  MEDIA ARE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF  POPE'S EXIT TO STRIKE WITH NEW SCANDAL RUMORS.
BLACKMAIL SEX SCANDAL. ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING THE  CATHOLIC'S CHURCH.
ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING SEX,  PROSTITUTION AND BLACKMAIL.
A SECRET NETWORK OF GAY  PRIESTS.
ALLEGES THAT A NETWORK THAT  THEY MAY HAVE MADE THEMSELVES  VULNERABLE TO MALE  PROSTITUTIONS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THERE'S EVEN CLAIMS OF HIDDEN  CAMERA FOOTAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, FOLKS, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT  VATICAN FOOTAGE. THERE ARE WOMEN IN THERE. [LAUGHTER] THIS INFORMATION --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- NOT ALLOWED. THEY ARE JUST NOT ALLOWED IN. THIS INFORMATION ABOUT SEX  PARTIES ALLEGEDLY COMES FROM AN  INVESTIGATION THE POPE HIMSELF ORDERED LAST APRIL AND WAS  RECENTLY DELIVERED TO HIM IN A  300-PAGE TWO VOLUME DOSSIER BOUND IN RED LEATHER, UNLESS  BOUND IN RED LEATHER WAS ONE OF  THE ACTS DESCRIBED. [LAUGHTER] THE ITALIAN NEWSPAPER SAYS THAT  POPE BENEDICT MADE THE DECISION  TO STEP DOWN ON DECEMBER 17, THE SAME DAY HE RECEIVED THE REPORT. SO EITHER THE REPORT DOES HAVE  VERY DAMNING EVIDENCE OR THE  POPE DIDN'T WANT TO READ 300  PAGES. [ LAUGHTER ] NATURALLY, THE VATICAN ISSUED A  STRONG RESPONSE TO THE  ALLEGATIONS SAYING IT'S DEPLORABLE THAT AS WE DRAW  CLOSER TO THE BEGINNING OF  CONCLAVE THAT THERE BE A WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION OF OFTEN  UNVERIFIED, UNVERIFIABLE OR  COMPLETELY FALSE NEWS STORIES. OKAY THESE STORIES ARE  COMPLETELY FALSE IS ONE OF THREE  OPTIONS THAT THE CHURCH IS  OFFERING. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOOK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --  [LAUGHTER] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M NOT  GOING TO SUGARCOAT IT. I CAN'T. IT'S LENT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE CHURCH, MY CHURCH, HAS HAD  SOME PROBLEMS. YES, HE WAS MOLESTED AND MONEY  WAS LAUNDERS. BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST NOW. SIDE NEW DAY FOR THE CATHOLIC  CHURCH. SEX SCANDALS SCANDALS ARE BEHIND US.
THE POPE ACCEPTING THE  RESIGNATION OF BRITISH CARDINAL  KEITH O'BRIEN WHO FOUND HILL SELF-THE SUBJECT OF A SEX  SCANDAL. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: YOU KNOW, ONE OF  THESE DAYS WE'RE GOING TO USE  THAT SECOND
