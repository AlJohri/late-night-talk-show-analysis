Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN INTELLIGENCE ANALYST WHOSE WORK AT BOTH THE CIA AND THE FBI, THAT MEANS BOTH OF HIS SHOES ARE PHONES. S PLEASE WELCOME PHILIP MUDD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT, PHILIP MUDD, 25 YEARS IN THE INTELLIGENCE WORLD. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CIA'S COUNTERTERRORIST CENTER FROM 2003 TO 2005 THEN BECAME THE FBI SENIOR INTELLIGENCE ADVISOR. AND YOU HAVE A BOOK ENTITLED TAKE DOWN, INSIDE THE HUNT FOR AL QAEDA.
RIGHT.
Stephen: DO WE REALLY TAKE DOWN AL QAEDA OR SHOULD IT BE CALLED SPREAD OUT INSIDE THE SCATTERING OF AL QAEDA.
I THINK IF YOU LOOKED AT THE ADVERSARY WE FACE 12 YEARS AGO IT BEAR THOSE RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT WE SEE TODAY. THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T FACE THE AL QAEDA GROUP TODAY, WE FACE THE REM NANTZ OF A REVOLUTION IN PLACES LIKE YEMEN, SOME ALI. THE ARCHITECTS ARE ALMOST GONE BUT THE REVOLUTION THEY INSPIRED LIVES ON.
Stephen: ARE WE STILL IN DANGER?
I THINK WE ARE. IF YOU LOOK AT HOME GROUP, PEOPLE WHO SIT AND LOOK AT A COMPUTER AND IMAGES FROM PLACES LIKE GAZA, IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, THOSE KIDS ARE INSPIRED BY EMOTION, TO SAY I WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. NOW THEY HAVE AN IDEAOLOGY THEY ATTACH THEMSELVES TO AND THAT IS CALLED AL QAEDA.
Stephen: SHOULD THE CIA HAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND OR PHYSICAL INTELLIGENCE IN PLACES OR SHOULD THEY BE MORE WATCHING YOUTUBE TO SEE WHAT'S INSPIRING THESE KIDS.
LOOK F YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE WAY A HUMAN BEING THINKS, YOU NEED A HUMAN INFORMANT NEXT TO THEM. YOU CAN FIND OUT INFORMATION FROM THE INTERNET, YOU CAN FIND OUT INFORMATION FROM TELEPHONE INTERCEPTS FROM E-MAILS BUT IN THE HISTORY OF TIME AND THAT HISTORY HASN'T CHANGED IN 2013, YOU CAN'T BEAT A HUMAN INFORMANT.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER MEET THAT GIRL FROM HOMELAND? (LAUGHTER)
I HAVE-- .
Stephen: STAY AWAY FROM HER, SHE'S CRAZY. HAVE YOU WATCHED THAT SHOW.
I HAVE NOT SEEN THE SHOW.
Stephen: YOU HAVEN'T? IT'S SO GOOD.
I GATHER IT'S QUITE GOODMENT I DON'T OWN A TV SO I DON'T WATCH THAT STUFF.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW THAT OUR TVs ARE SPYING ON US S THAT WHY. BECAUSE I WOULD BELIEVE THAT AT THIS POINT. WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT, THAT MY TV COULD SEE ME, WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT.
NO I WOULDN'T-- .
Stephen: YES, YOU WOULD. GENERAL PETRAEUS SAID OUR MICROWAVES ARE SPYING ON US.
NONSENSE.
Stephen: HE'S A HERO. YOU JUST SAID NONSENSE ABOUT GENERAL PETRAEUS. HOW DARE YOU. AMERICAN CULTURE HAS A LOT TO YOU EVER A. WE HAVE GREAT BOOKS, GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT CAFES, GREAT FOOD B 18 DOWN ON THAT LIST FOR ME IS TV. WHICH TURNS YOUR BRAIN INTO COTTON CANDY SO I DECIDED TO YEARS AGO, DUMP IT.
Stephen: I GOT ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU. WE'RE NOT ON BROADWAY RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: TV IS SELLING YOUR BOOK, TV IS SELLING YOUR BOOK RIGHT NOW. YOU WANT TO AMEND THAT IN ANY WAY?
NO, GO READ A BOOK.
Stephen: I DON'T HAVE TO, BECAUSE I HAVE CABLE. ALL RIGHT, I HAVE SOMEBODY READ A BOOK TO ME ON CABLE, ALL RIGHT. YOU EVER HEARD OF THE READING RAINBOW?
NO, I HAVEN'T.
Stephen: YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF THE READING RAINBOW.
Stephen: WELL, WHO'S THE DUMBY NOW. HOW DARE YOU. HOW DARE YOU, SIR. OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT SYRIA. YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT SYRIA, RIGHT.
YES, I DO.
Stephen: THE BOTTOM LINE SU SHOULD GO, RIGHT.
YES, CORRECT.
Stephen: THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T THINK SO.
I UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: HOW CAN WE --
YOU DON'T CARE, WITH.
NO, I SAID I UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: OH, I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU DON'T CARE. BECAUSE-- I DON'T CARE. OKAY, THEY GET THINGS WRONG. IT'S OUR-- IT'S OUR GOAL TO LEAD THEM, RIGHT.
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY. SO WHY DO YOU THINK THEY DON'T WANT TO GO?
BECAUSE I THINK THEY LOOK AT IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND SAY TOO MANY BOYS AND GIRLS, MEN AND WOMEN FROM THIS COUNTRY IS DIED IN WAR AND TERRORIST EVENTS AND WE WANT OUT. WE'VE DONE WITH THIS.
Stephen: NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU HELP PREPARE COLIN POWELL'S BEFORE THE U.N. SAYING THERE WERE WEAPONS OF PASS DESTRUCTION.
I CAME UP WITH THE SPEECH AND CAME WITH HIM WHEN HE GAVE THE SPOCH.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK HE ACTUALLY HAD EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS WECHES OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN IRAQ BECAUSE PEOPLE KEEP POINTING TO THAT TESTIMONY AND GOING WE HEARD THIS, THEY WEREN'T THERE, THAT'S WHY WE'RE RELUCTANT TO GO INTO SYRIA.
I THINK THAT SAY RED HERRING. FIRST THE U.N. IS ABOUT TO COME OUT AND SAY THERE FROM CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED IN SYRIA. SO THAT IS A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT STORY FROM IRAQ. BUT I WOULD GO BACK TO SEEING-- .
Stephen: THERE ARE DOUBTS, GUYS LIKE PUTIN ARE SAYING MAYBE IT WASN'T THE GOVERNMENT THAT DID IT.
IT IS VLADIMIR PUTIN, WHAT THE HELL HE IS GOING TO SAY.
Stephen: HE'S GOING TO SAY "NEW YORK TIMES", NEW YORK FILES WOULD YOU PLEASE PRINT MY IDEAS WITH WITHOUT COMMENT? AND THEY DID, SO PEOPLE WILL READ THAT AND BELIEVE HIM.
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
Stephen: YES, THEY WILL. HAVE YOU --
I DON'T THINK THE QUESTION WMD. I THINK THE QUESTION IS A TYRANT WHO HAS A RECKLESS ABANDON WHEN HE MURDERS INNOCENCE. AT WHAT POINT DOW DRAW A LINE AND SAY WE ARE NOT JUST U.S. CITIZENS, WE'RE GLOBAL CITIZENS. ONE MORE THING, HISTORY F WE THINK OF WHERE WE'RE GO TO BE IN 10 OR 20 YEARS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO TELL OUR KIDS, THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE BECAUSE WE WERE AFRAID TO DEFEND AGAINST THE MURDZ OF 100,000 INNOCENTS. I DON'T WANT TO BE THERE FOR THAT.
Stephen: NOW WHEN DID YOU LEAVE THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.
2010.
Stephen: 2010. OKAY, YOU WERE GOING TO BE GIVEN A POSITION, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND QUESTIONS WERE RAISED ABOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF ENHANCING INTERROGATION AND YOU REMOVED YOURSELF.
CORRECT.
Stephen: FROM THE NOMINATION PROCESS.
SO FAR YOU GOT T THAT'S CORRECT.
Stephen: SO FAR I HAVE GOT T STOP ME WHEN I DON'T HAVE IT ANY MORE. WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ENHANCED INTERROGATION AND DOW BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE DOING IT?
I WAS INVOLVED AND DEPUTY DIRECTED THE COUNTER TER CYST CENTER THAT CONDUCTED THOSE INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES AND HOUSED AL QAEDA PRISONERS. I DON'T REGRET WHAT WE DID THEN BUT SINCE THENED AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE TIME AND THE SPACE TO DEBATE THIS ISSUE. AND THEY'VE SAID WE DON'T LIKE IT AND WE DON'T WANT OUR SECURITY SERVICES DOING IT. SO I RESPECT THAT, THE SECURITY SERVICE IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY SERVED AT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. AND THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE HAS SPOKEN.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT SWING BACK, WE GET ATTACKED AGAIN.
NO WAY, NO WAY.
Stephen: IF WE GET ATTACKED AGAIN.
NO WAY, DUDE, IT'S TO THE GOING TO HAPPEN. FURTHERMORE F IT DID THE PEOPLE IN MY POSITION, AND I WOULD DO THE SAME F I WERE THEM WOULD, SAY NO AND IF I WERE WERE THERE I WOULD RESIGN, THAT AIN'T GOING HAPPEN AGAIN.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER RENDITION ANYBODY.
NO, I SIGNED PAPERS TO DO IT, TO HAVE PEOPLE.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN --
I WASN'T ON THE PLANE.
Stephen: WELL-- EITHER WAS-- NEITHER WAS PRESIDENT BUSH.
SO I'M-- IF ARE YOU ASKING IF I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THAT, THE ANSWER IS YES.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT DO YOU THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
YES.
Stephen: AND RENDITION SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE TO SYRIA?
I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES. I DON'T-- WE RENDERED A LOT OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: ANY CHANCE WE WILL KILL PEOPLE WE RENDITIONED IF WE BOMB OVER THERE.
POSSIBLY.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. (APPLAUSE) PHILIP MUDD, THE BOOK IS TAKEDOWN, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
