Stephen:  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT  RELEASED A NEW BOOK ABOUT  AMERICA. AS BEN FRANKLIN SAID "IT'S THE  MUST READ BOOK OF THE SUMMER."  PLEASE WELCOME SHELDON WHITE  HOUSE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I LOVE HAVING SENATORS ON  BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE THE  EXCLUSIVE CLUB, RIGHT? YOU GUYS GOT BETTER WASHROOMS  AND EVERYTHING, I'M SURE:.
THEY'RE ACTUALLY REDOING THE  WOMEN'S SENATE WASHROOM.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT  MATTER TO YOU, SIR?
MAKES EVERYBODY HAPPIER.
Stephen: IT DOES? DOES IT REALLY.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK. LET'S PUSH SOME PITCH AER, SIR. IT'S CALLED "ON VIRTUES,  QUOTATIONS AND INSIGHTS TO LIVE  A TRULY AMERICAN LIFE." THAT STARTED OFF AS A NOTEBOOK  OF YOURS, RIGHT?
YUP.
Stephen: HOW LONG DID YOU  WORK ON THIS BOOK?
CLOSE ON 20 YEARS I PUT THE  FIRST ONE DOWN AND I'VE HAD THIS  LITTLE PAPER BOOK WITH ME. WHEN I LOVE IT, I WRITE IT DOWN.
Stephen: THAT WHY CONGRESS  CAN GET NOTHING DOWN BECAUSE IT  TAKES YOU 20 YEARS TO WRITE A BOOK?"  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IT'S WORSE THAN  THAT. WE USE MOSTLY OTHER PEOPLE'S  WORDS.
SELECTION.
Stephen: SELECTION.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE SAMPLING. SO THIS IS YOUR IDEA OF AFTER  RAP SONG. (LAUGHTER)  YOU'RE SAMPLING OTHER PEOPLE'S  WORK.
YEAH, IT'S THE GOOD PART.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT SOME PHAT  BEATS IN HERE FROM ABRAHAM  LINCOLN AND THEODORE ROOSEVELT BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT THINGS FROM,  LIKE, WIN WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE  AND WINSTON CHURCHILL. THIS IS HONORABLE TRULY AMERICAN  LIFE. WHAT DO THEY KNOW? WHAT DO ENGLISH-- PARDON ME--  LIMEY BASTARDS KNOW? (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN THAT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE  WAY. WHY WOULD YOU QUOTE SOMEONE ELSE  TO TALK ABOUT THE TRULY AMERICAN  LIFE?
BECAUSE SOME OF THE  PRINCIPLES THAT ARE MOST  DISTINCTLY AMERICAN ARE ONES THAT ARE PART OF THE HUMAN  CONDITION AND THAT PEOPLE LIKE  SHAKESPEARE COULD HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT AND CHURCHILL, OF COURSE,  WAS PART AMERICAN. HIS MOM WAS AMERICAN.
Stephen: IT COMES FROM HIS  FATHER'S SIDE. IT WAS HIS FATHER'S SIDE. YEAH. (LAUGHTER)  DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE GET TO  HERE? SOMETHING THAT IF YOU HAD TO  THROW AUTOALL THE OTHERS AND  JUST KEEP ONE, WHAT WOULD IT BE?
THERE'S A VERY SHORT COUPLEET  THAT SAYS "LIFE IS MOSTLY FROTH  AND BUBBLE, TWO THINGS STAND LIKE STONE: KINDNESS IN  ANOTHER'S TROUBLE, COURAGE IN  ONE'S OWN."  NOT BAD.
Stephen: NO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I BELIEVE THAT WAS WRITTEN BY  FLO-RIDA. (LAUGHTER)
COULD HAVE BEEN! OR ILLIN' NOISE.
Stephen: AM I QUOTED IN YOUR  BOOK?
REGRETTABLY NOT. IS THAT A RECALL ISSUE OR --.
Stephen: NO, I'M GLAD BECAUSE  MY FAVORITE QUOTE IS "YOU'LL BE  HEARING FROM MY LAWYER." (LAUGHTER)  I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER I  COULD CALL YOU INTO COURT.
I'M SAFE.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU PUT THE  BOOK OUT? BECAUSE, NO OFFENSE, "ON VIRTUE"  YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT, WHAT DO  DEMOCRATS KNOW ABOUT VIRTUE NEW VIRTUES ARE A CONSERVATIVE  IDEAL. THEY'RE ABOUT GENERALLY  PRESERVING WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT  OUR COUNTRY WHEN DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO SELL US DOWN THE  RIVER TO THE FIRST INTEREST  GROUP WITH A RAINBOW FLAG. (LAUGHTER)  WHY DO YOU THINK -- WHY DO YOU  THINK YOU'RE SUITED TO PICK OUR  VIRTUOUS QUOTES?
I THINK THAT WASHINGTON RIGHT  NOW IS A LITTLE SHORT ON SOME OF  THE VIRTUES AND I'M NOT EVEN THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM RHODE ISLAND  BUT I WANT TO DO WHAT I CAN TO  TRY TO PUSH A DIFFERENT DEBATE INTO THE DISCUSSION AND TO LOOK  BACK AND SEE WHAT PEOPLE HAVE  SAID AND DONE AT SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TIMES IN HISTORY,  THINGS THAT CAPTURE A PARTICULAR  PIECE OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT. I THINK THAT ADDS A LITTLE BIT  OF VALUE. MAYBE ONLY A LITTLE BIT BUT YOU  DO WHAT YOU CAN.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THIS IS  AN IMPORTANT TIME IN HUMAN  HISTORY?
I DO.
Stephen: WHY IS NOTHING  HAPPENING THEN? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IF THIS IS SO IMPORTANT, WHY IS  NOTHING HAPPENING? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BECAUSE WE'RE AT A JUNCTION  AND THE FIGHT IS WHERE DO WE  TURN? WHAT DIRECTION DO WE GO? AND PRETTY SOON I THINK  PARALYSIS IN WASHINGTON IS GOING  TO BREAK. I THINK THE GRIP OF THE TEA  PARTY ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS  GOING TO DIMINISH. I THINK A MORE MODERATE  REPUBLICAN IS GOING TO BE ABLE  TO A PEER AND WE'LL WORK TOGETHER AND MOVE FORWARD IN TO  BROAD AND SUMMIT UPLANDS.
Stephen: RULELY? HOW ABOUT THAT? YOU'VE GOT THESE THINGS IN YOUR  POCKET ALL THE TIME! (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S REALLY KIND OF A TRUMP  CARD WHEREVER YOU'RE HAVING AN  ARGUMENT WITH SOMEBODY YOU CAN SAY "AS SHAKESPEARE SAID "YOU'RE  WRONG AND I'M RIGHT."  WELL, SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE BOOK IS "ON VIRTUE" THE MAN  IS SHELDON WHITE HOUSE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
