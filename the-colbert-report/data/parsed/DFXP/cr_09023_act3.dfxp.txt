Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT  IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS NEW DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE  DUST BOWL. IF HE BRINGS THE GRAPE, I'LL  BRING THE WRATH. PLEASE WELCOME KEN BURNS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HEY, KEN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING  ON.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WE  HAVE A MELANGE OF  DOCUMENTARIES.
WE DO.
Stephen: LET'S SEE, OSCAR  NOMINATED-- NOMINATED EMMY  AWARD DOCUMENTARY, CIVIL WAR, JAZZ, PROHIBITION, TWO  DUALARIES NOW, THE CENTRAL  PARK 5 WITH YOUR DAUGHTER  AND SOME YOU MADE, AND THAT WILL BE IN THEATRES NOVEMBER  23rd. AND THE DUST BOWL WHICH WILL  AIR IN TWO PARTS ON NOVEMBER  19th AND 18th, NOT IN THAT  ORDER.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: ON PBS. LET'S TUCK ABOUT THE DUST  BOWL FIRST. I HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE DUST  BOWL, OKAY. HOW BIG OF A DEAL WAS IT? HOW BIG OF A THING WAS IT.
THIS IS THE WORST  MAN-MADE ECOLOGICAL  CATASTROPHE IN AMERICAN  HISTORY, A TEN YEAR APOCALYPSE THAT NOT ONLY  KILLED CROPS AND CATTLE BUT  PEOPLE'S CHILDREN AS WELL. THIS WAS NOT JUST A HANDFUL  OF STORMS BUT HUNDREDS OF  STORMS THAT WOULD MOVE DIRT ALL THE WAY FROM OKLAHOMA  AND THE PANEL PANHANDLE OF  TEXAS AND KANSAS AND  COLORADO, NEW MEXICO ALL THE WAY EAST, FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT  WENT LIKE THIS AND HAD  OKLAHOMA IN HIS FINGERTIPS  AND THE NEXT DAY SHIPPED AT SEA WAS COVERED WITH THE  PATINA OF DUST. ONE STORM MOVED MORE DIRT IN  ONE 24 HOUR PERIOD THAN IT  TOOK TO EXCAVATE THE PANAMA CANAL, TEN YEARS OF  EXCAVATION.
Stephen: OKAY, HOW DO WE  KNOW THIS IS MAN-MADE, OKAY? THE SCIENCE IS NOT IN ON THE  DUST BOWL.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY WHY IS THIS  MAN-MADE.
THIS IS MAN-MADE BECAUSE  THIS WAS NATURAL GRASS LAND,  BUFFALO GRASS, SHORT GRASS THAT WENT FIVE FEET BELOW  THE SURFACE TO HOLD THE  MOISTURE AND KEEP THE  TOPSOIL AGAINST THE EVER PRESENT WINDS AND ARID SEMI  DESERT CLIMATE. AND WHEN WE TORE UP A  SECTION GREATER THAN THE  STATE OF OHIO, BIGGER THAN  THE ALL-IMPORTANT STATE OF OHIO, IF BLEW.
Stephen: EVERYTHING  POLITICS.
EVERYTHING POLITICS.
Stephen: I HAVE BEEN TO  OKLAHOMA, IT'S FINES THERE,  A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
Stephen: SO IT FIXED  ITSELF. NATURE FIXES ITSELF IT IS  ALL DONE.
IT TOOK A LOT OF THINGS  TO HAPPEN. THE GOVERNMENT COMES IN,  THEY BUY BACK SOME LAND. THEY REPLANT GRASS LANDS  THEY PLANT HUNDREDS OF  MILLIONS OF TREES. THEY PAY FARMERS NOT TO GROW  FOR THE FIRST TIME. THEY TELL THEM HOW TO ROTATE  THEIR CROPS, HOW TO PLOW  BETTER.
Stephen: THIS IS JUST BIG  GOVERNMENT TELLING SMALL  BUSINESS WHAT TO DO.
EXACTLY. AND THIS WAS A VERY  INDEPENDENT AREA OF THE  COUNTRY THAT BEGGED THE  GOVERNMENT TO COME IN AND HELP THEM OUT OF THIS. BECAUSE AT SOMEONE SAYS IN  OUR FILM, WHEN YOUR BACK IS  UP AGAINST THE WALL,  IDEOLOGY GOES OUT THE WINDOW AND THEY INVITED THE  ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION IN. AND WE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT  OKLAHOMA WAS A RED STATE, IT  BECAME A BLUE STATE FOR A LONG TIME AND NOW IT'S A RED  STATE.
Stephen: WELL, ACTUALLY  THE DEMOCRATS ARE PRAYING  FOR ANOTHER DUST BOWL TO GET IT BECOME BA. YOU HAVE ANOTHER DOCUMENTARY  THAT YOU MADE WITH YOUR  DAUGHTER AND SOME CALLED THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE. OKAY, THAT RELEASES IN  THEATRES NOVEMBER 23rd. THESE ARE FIVE KIDS WHO WHAT,  1989.
1989.
Stephen: THEY CONFESSED  TO A RAPE IN CENTRAL PARK. SO THEY GO INTO THE PARK AND  THEY ARE FOOLING AROUND WITH  A LOT OF OTHER KIDS. THE COP AS REST A FEW OF  THEM. THEY ARE GOING TO RELEASE  THEM TO THEIR PARENTS AND  THEY DISCOVER THIS JOGGER  BRUTALLY RAPED IN ANOTHER PART OF THE PARK. THEY THINK THESE KIDS MIGHT  HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH  IT. THEY CALL IF A LOT OF KIDS  BUT THESE KID HAD NEVER BEEN  IN TROUBLE BEFORE, THESE  FIVE. AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT  MIRANDA. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEIR  PARENTS MOST OF THE TIME. AND THE COPS INTERVIEWED  THEM FOR 30 HOURS AND SAID  LOOK, WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO T ARE YOU A GOOD KID, BUT  THIS GUY KEN IS SAYING YOU  DID IT, IF YOU SAY HE DID WE WILL LET YOU GO HOME.
Stephen: WHY WOULD-- WHY  WOULD YOU SAY THAT.
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO GO  HOME. 13 YEARS LATER WHEN THEY  SERVE OUT THE FULL SENTENCES  THE REAL RAPIST CAME FORWARD, ADMITTED WHAT HE HAD DONE. THE DNA MATCHED. THEY HADN'T HAD A DNA MATCH.
Stephen: YOU HAVE FIVE  KIDS, YOU KNOW WHO CONFESSED  TO A CRIME. WHAT THEY SUPPOSED TO DO NOT  THROW THEM IN JAIL. THEY CONFESSED --
THEY IMMEDIATELY-- .
Stephen: HOW MUCH DOES  YOUR LIBERAL BLEEDING  HEART/ --
A JUROR HELD OUT FOR TEN  DAYS BUT EVERYBODY WAS  COPING ON HIM HE'S DECIDE WANTED TO GO HOME SO THEN  THEIR CONVICTIONS GET  VACATED. ROBERT MORGEN THAL, THE  DISTRICT ATTORNEY  REINVESTIGATES AND SAYS ALL  THESE MISTAKES WERE MADE. IF WE KNEW THEN WHAT WE KNEW  NOW WE WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE  CHARGED THEM AND THE KIDS LAUNCH A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST  THE CITY.
Stephen: THEY'RE SUING. THE KIDS ARE SUING, $50  MILLION A PIECE.
THAT'S RIGHT. THE CITY IS ASKING YOU FOR  YOUR NOTES AND FOR YOUR  OUTTAKES OF YOUR VIDEO. YOU WON'T GIVE THEM TO THEM. WHAT ARE YOU HIDING? >>.
I DON'T THINK AFTER TEN  YEARS OF STALLING KNOWING  THAT WE DID THESE INTERVIEWS THREE YEARS AGO, KNOWING  THAT WE ASKED EVERY SIX  MONTHS FOR THEM, THE COPS  AND THE PROSECUTORS TO COME FORWARD AND BE IN OUR FILM  AND THEY REFUSED, SOMETIMES  DIDN'T HONOR US WITH THE COURTESY OF A RETURNED PHONE  CALL ALL OF A SUDDEN WE GO  TO THE CAN NES FILM FESTIVAL AND OPENING THEE ATICALLY,  SUDDENLY THEY WANT OUR  OUTTAKES AND NOTESMENT I  DON'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT, AND I THOUGHT, I WAS CERTAIN  YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THIS,  THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD WANT TO INTRUDE IN THE LIVES  OF THE JOURNALISTS OR A  FILMMAKER DOING THEIR JOB. AND SO WE TOLD THEM WHAT  THEY COULD DO WITH THEIR  SUBPOENA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. KEN, THANK YOU FOR BEING  HERE. KEN BURNS
