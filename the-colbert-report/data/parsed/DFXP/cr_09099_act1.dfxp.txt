Stephen: TONIGHT, HOW DO YOU  SELL ENERGY-EFFICIENT LIGHT  BULBS TO CONSERVATIVES? TRY PUTTING A TRIGGER ON IT. THEN THE NEWEST TREND IN  PARENTING. INSTEAD OF THE SEX TALK, JUST  LET THEM WATCH "GAME OF  THRONES."  AND MY GUEST, DR. RICHARD BESSER IS ABC NEWS' CHIEF MEDICAL  CORRESPONDENT. I'LL ASK HIM HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO  CURING CHRONIC STEPHANAPOLOUS. DEADLY GIANT SNAILS HAVE BEEN  FOUND IN HOUSTON. QUICK, SAUNTER FOR YOUR LIVES. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! tephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS,  THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  TONIGHT RIGHT NOW THESE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, I DON'T KNOW WHERE  TO BEGIN. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN ON  HOW TO THANK THESE PEOPLE. TONIGHT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM  ARE NOT JUST AN AUDIENCE. PLEASE, PLEASE, SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN. I ALMOST CAN'T CONTROL THEM. THEY'RE NOT AN AUDIENCE. THEY'RE A MOVEMENT. AND FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR THAT  OPENING BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO TELL  YOU TONIGHT I AM ANGRY. AND FOR ONCE THAT DOESN'T MAKE  ME HAPPY. AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHY.
THE SCANDAL-TAINTED FORMER  SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR MARK  SANFORD WON BACK HIS OLD SEAT IN CONGRESS TUESDAY. THE SISTER OF STEPHEN COLBERT.
Stephen: MY SISTER LOST. HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? I WAS SO SURE LULU HAD WON  BECAUSE CNN CALLED IT FOR  SANFORD. BUT THE VOTERS -- WHAT CAN I  SAY -- THE VOTERS OF SOUTH  CAROLINA HAVE SPOKEN. MARK SANFORD BEAT MY SISTER, AND  I BELIEVE THAT MEANS MARK  SANFORD IS NOW MY SISTER. AND ON BEHALF OF MY ENTIRE  FAMILY, I WANT TO SAY WE'RE  DEEPLY SORRY ABOUT HIM. NOW I KNOW HOW KEVIN MANSON MUST  HAVE FELT. I MEAN, I FEEL SO BETRAYED BY  SOUTH CAROLINA. WELL, IF THEY'RE GOING TO TURN  THEIR BACKS ON MY FAMILY, I'M  TURNING MY BACK ON THEM. NO, I AM. FROM NOW ON -- AND I NEVER  THOUGHT I WOULD EVER SAY THIS --  I AM FROM NORTH CAROLINA. NO, I HAVE TO. I HAVE TO! I'M A TAR HEEL NOW WHATEVER THE [BLEEP] THAT MEANS. AND AS A NORTH CAROLINAN, I LOVE  OUR STATE BIRD, THE CARDINAL. THAT'S A STUPID BIRD. BUT IT'S MINE NOW AND I LOVE IT  AS MUCH AS OUR STATE DOG, THE  PLOTT HOUND. JESUS, WELL, WHATEVER. BUT MOST SHOCKINGLY, I WILL NO  LONGER ENJOY SOUTH CAROLINA'S  TANKY, SAVORY, JUICY AND DEEPLY DELICIOUS BARBECUE, MADE WITH  OUR UNIQUE MUSTARD-BASED SAUCE. NOW INSTEAD I NOW OFFICIALLY  LOVE NORTH CAROLINA SAUCELESS  VINEGAR-BASED MEAT PRODUCT THAT THEY CALL BARBECUE. MMMM. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I'M GOING TO GET ME SOME. HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. FOR LULU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). MMM. THAT IS A... I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT? I MIGHT JUST LEAVE THE REST OF  THAT FOR LATER. OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I CAN'T DO IT. I CAN'T DO IT. I LOVE SOUTH CAROLINA TOO MUCH. AND I LOVE MY SISTER. AND I'M SO PROUD OF HER. BUT I JUST DON'T GET IT. WHERE DID LULU GO WRONG? DID SHE NOT CAMPAIGN HARD  ENOUGH? DID SHE NOT RAISE ENOUGH MONEY? DID SHE HOLD TOO FEW DEBATES  AGAINST A CARDBOARD NANCY  PELOSI? I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THIS SCARES  ME TO MY CORE. I'M SHAKING. THIS WAS THE FIRST POLITICAL  CAMPAIGN WHERE I KNEW AND CARED  ABOUT THE CANDIDATE BEFORE THEY GOT INTO POLITICS. I SAW FIRST-HAND HOW HER  OPPONENTS SMEARED HER WITH  OUTRAGEOUS ACCUSATIONS I KNEW TO BE UNTRUE. AND THAT HAS MADE ME WONDER IF  OTHER CAMPAIGNS HAVE DONE THIS  AS WELL. I MEAN, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT JOHN  McCAIN ACTUALLY DOESN'T HAVE  AN ILLEGITIMATE BLACK CHILD? AND DOES THAT MEAN MEGAN  McCAIN IS WHITE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE  ANYMORE. AND COULD IT BE THAT "I" HAVE  LIED ABOUT CANDIDATES I DISAGREE  WITH LIKE THAT TIME I SAID THAT HARRY REID IS JUST A LEATHER  SADDLE BAG BROUGHT TO LIFE BY A  NAVAJO SHAMAN. I MEAN IT FEELS TRUE BUT MAYBE  IT'S NOT. I DON'T KNOW. OR MAYBE IT HAD NOTHING TO DO  WITH THE CANDIDATE. AFTER ALL, THE FIRST DISTRICT IS  A SOLIDLY REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD. AND I KNOW YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO  STICK WITH YOUR TEAM NO MATTER  WHAT. THAT'S WHY EVERY FOOTBALL SEASON  I PUT MY MONEY ON THE BALTIMORE  COLTS. IT IS COMEBACK TIME, JOHNNY U! THE POINT IS, IN POLITICS, IT IS  US VERSUS THEM. BUT APPARENTLY SOME OF THEM HAVE  THE NERVE TO CALL THEM US. HOW DARE THEM. AND, FOLKS, I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED  IN PARTISANSHIP BUT NOW THAT  IT'S COST MY SISTER A SEAT IN CONGRESS, I HAVE MY DOUBTS. AFTER ALL, PARTISANSHIP HAS MADE  IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR  ANYTHING TO GET DONE IN  WASHINGTON. CONGRESS CAN'T RAISE THE DEBT  CEILING. THEY CAN'T PASS A BUDGET. AND THE HOUSE SPENT ALL LAST  WEEK DEBATING WHETHER THEY ARE  DEAD LOCKED OR GRIDLOCKED UNTIL THEY FINALLY REACHED A  STALEMATE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE BLAME  THIS ON RIFTS WITHIN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY. FOR INSTANCE, THE  G.O.P.-CONTROLLED HOUSE TOOK TWO  DAYS TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT EXTENDED THE GOVERNMENT'S HELIUM  RESERVES WHICH DEMOCRATS WOULD  HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO PASS BY UNANIMOUS VOICE VOTE. BUT YOU CAN'T PASS A HELIUM BILL  BY VOICE VOTE. IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING. (HELIUM VOICE. ) THE GENTLEMAN FROM MISSISSIPPI  VOTES WHEEEEEE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). [BLEEP] MARK SANFORD. NOW, FOLKS, OF COURSE OTHER  PEOPLE SAY IT'S OBAMA'S FAULT  LIKE "NEW YORK TIMES" COLUMNIST MAUREEN DOWD WHO RECENTLY WROTE  THE JOB OF THE FORMER COMMUNITY  ORGANIZER AND SELF-STYLED UNITER IS TO SOMEHOW GET CONGRESS TO DO  THE STUFF HE WANTS THEM TO DO. IT'S CALLED LEADERSHIP. YES, THE DEFINITION OF  LEADERSHIP IS GETTING PEOPLE WHO  DESPISE YOU TO WORK WITH YOU. IT'S ALSO THE DEFINITION OF THE  EAGLES. SO OBVIOUSLY THERE'S PLENTY OF  BLAME TO GO AROUND, FOLKS,  INCLUDING BLAMING -- AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS -- THE  VOTERS. BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW STUDY IN  THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL  ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OR P-NAS THAT SAYS PARTISANSHIP GOES  DEEPER THAN WE THOUGHT.
LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE  STUDY PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN  TWO BUCKS TO SPEND ON A LIGHT BULB AND HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A  50 CENT INCAN CECENT BULB OR THE  $1.50 COMPACT FLUORESCENT BULK. BOTH CHOSE THE EFFICIENT BULB  BUT IF IT WAS LABELED WITH A  STICKER THAT SAID PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT THOSE WHO IDENTIFIED  THEMSELVES AS POLITICALLY  MODERATE OR CONSERVATIVE WERE LESS LIKELY TO BUY THAT LIGHT  BULB.
Stephen: OF COURSE THEY WON'T  BUY IT NOW ITS A LIBERAL LIGHT  BULB. IT WILL LET YOU SCREW IT IN  BEFORE YOU'RE MARRIED TO IT. BUT IF WE'RE ALL ON TEAMS NOW,  TO GET CONSERVATIVES TO BUY  ECO-PRODUCTS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SAY THEY'RE BAD FOR THE  PLANET. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BUY 7th  GENERATION RECYCLED TOILET PAPER  BUT WE'LL LINE UP IN DROVES FOR FIRST GENERATION SEQUOIA MURDER  NOW WITH 20% MORE SEAL PUP. AND I MAY BE A MAN, BUT I WILL  BUY A CRATE OF TAMPONS IF THE  BOX FEATURES A CRYING BARACK  OBAMA. HE'S SAD, HE'S SAD BECAUSE ALL  THE HORMONES IN THE WATER SUPPLY  NOW MAKE ME MENSTRUATE. FOLKS, THIS CUTTING OFF OUR NOSE  TO SPITE THE OTHER GUY'S FACE  GOES BEYOND LIGHT BULBS. A RECENT GALLUP POLL ON GUN  CONTROL FOUND THAT 73% OF  REPUBLICANS WOULD VOTE TO EXPAND BACKGROUND CHECKS BUT A SECOND  GALLUP POLL FOUND THAT 50% OF  REPUBLICANS APPROVED THE SENATE NOT PASSING BACKGROUND CHECKS. THAT MEANS 23% OF REPUBLICANS  ARE HAPPY THAT THE SENATE VOTED  AGAINST THE BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT THOSE SAME 23% WOULD HAVE  VOTED FOR. WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE THEY  WROTE THEIR SENATORS A NICE  THANK YOU THREAT. AND THE REPUBLICAN COSPONSOR OF  THE BILL PAT TOO MANIY KNOWS HOW  THIS IS POSSIBLE.
THERE WERE PEOPLE ON MY SIDE  WHO DID NOT WANT TO PERCEIVED TO  BE HELPING SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH  SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S THE  PRESIDENT WHO WANTS TO  ACCOMPLISH IT.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. IF THE PRESIDENT GOES LEFT, WE  GO RIGHT. HE ZIGS, WE REFUSE TO RAISE THE  DEBT LIMIT AND DESTROY THE  GLOBAL ECONOMY. BUT DON'T GET SMUG, DEMOCRATS. BECAUSE IN 2009, 72% OF  DEMOCRATS SUPPORTED OBAMA'S PLAN  TO CLOSE GUANTANAMO WITHIN A  YEAR. BUT AFTER OBAMA BACKED OFF, ONLY  32% OF DEMOCRATS WANTED TO CLOSE  IT. THAT'S WHAT I CALL A FLIP FLOP. UNLESS THE PRESIDENT CALLS IT  THAT, IN WHICH CASE I CALL IT  INTEGRITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I LOVE IT. OKAY. SO MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, IT'S TIME  EVERYBODY OUT THERE STOPS BASING  EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE ON... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ... ON PARTY AFFILIATION. INSTEAD ADMIT THAT EVERY ONCE IN  A WHILE, YOU MIGHT AGREE WITH  THE OTHER SIDE. I'M TALKING ABOUT ALL OF YOU  PEOPLE, OF COURSE, NOT ME. I MAKE A LIVING ATTACKING PEOPLE  WITHOUT THOUGHT. FOR INSTANCE, THE LIBERAL  GLUTEN-FREE AGENDA IS TURNING  OUR DOGS LESBIAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
