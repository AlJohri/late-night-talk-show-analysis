( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A NASCAR  DRIVER WHO RECENTLY WON POLE  POSITION AT THE DAYTONA 500. I HAD NO IDEA THEY'VE BEEN  RACING THAT THING FOR 500 YEARS. PLEASE WELCOME DANICA PATRICK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). MS. PATRICK, MAY I CALL YOU  DANICA.
YES, PLEASE. HOWEVER YOU FEEL NECESSARY TO  ADDRESS ME.
Stephen: DANICA, THANKS SO  MUCH FOR COMING ON. I AM A HUGE FAN OF YOU, OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, NASCAR IS THE  GREAT AMERICAN SPORT. ALL RIGHT.
I AGREE. Stephen: EVERYBODY TALKS  ABOUT DANICA PATRICK, YOU KNOW,  FIRST WOMAN TO GET POLE POSITION AT DAYTONA 500. THAT KIND OF STUFF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). DO YOU EVER GET TIRED OF LIFE. I'M A WOMAN. I'M A DRIVER. I'M NOT A WOMAN DRIVER. I'M A DRIVER DRIVER.
I MEAN PEOPLE MENTION IT. I DON'T REALLY MIND BECAUSE I  KNOW IT'S WHAT HELPED ME GET TO  WHERE I AM. I HOPE WHEN I'M DONE RACING THAT  PEOPLE REMEMBER ME AS A GREAT  DRIVER.
Stephen: SO PERCEIVE YOU AS A  WOMAN. I DON'T. YOU COULD HAVE JUST EASILY BE A  MAN. CAN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE  FINER POINTS OF THE NASCAR.
OKAY. Stephen: YOU START OFF WITH  AN INDY CAR.
I'M NOT VERY SMART WITH THIS  STUFF. MAKE THEM SOFTBALL QUESTIONS FOR  ME.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU TURN TO  THE LEFT? WHY DO YOU NEVER TURN TO THE  RIGHT?
ACTUALLY THERE'S A STORY WHEN  I WAS A KID I WAS RACING  GO-CARTS AND MY DAD WONDERED IF I HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY RIGHT  EYE BECAUSE I SEEMED TO STRUGGLE  WITH THE RIGHT-HANDED CORNERS. NO JOKE. THIS IS SERIOUSLY SOMETHING HE  SAID. APPARENTLY THAT'S WHAT MADE ME  MIGRATE TOWARDS TURNING LEFT A  LOT. MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH  MY RIGHT EYE.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE TO  PSYCHE YOURSELF UP BEFORE THE  RACE? DO YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND  SAY, GO FAST. WHAT DO YOU SAY FOR YOURSELF.
PLAY EYE OF THE TIGER. Stephen: WHAT DO YOU DO  BEFORE YOU GO OUT AND RACE. WHAT'S YOUR PREP?
I EAT. Stephen: REALLY? I EAT A LOT. Stephen: ARE YOU... NO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I'M NOT.
Stephen: BECAUSE I'VE BEEN  DRIVING FOR YEARS AND MY ASS  JUST KEEPS GETTING BIGGER. HOW DO YOU STAY IN SHAPE FOR  THIS KIND OF A SPORT?
CARDIOWISE THAT'S WHAT IT  REALLY IS.
Stephen: CARDIO, REALLY? I THINK THERE WAS A STUDY  DONE THAT OUR HEART RATE IS THAT  OF ABOUT A RUNNER'S PACE THE WHOLE TIME. I DON'T KNOW 140 TO 180. I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL LIKE ABOUT 200 BEATS A  MINUTE WHEN I'M RUNNING.
Stephen: WHY DOES YOUR HEART  RACE SO HIGH? IS IT JUST THE ADRENALINE?
PEOPLE ARE MAKING US MAD OUT  THERE.
Stephen: REALLY? DOESN'T YOUR HEART RATE GO UP  WHEN PEOPLE MAKE YOU MAD ON THE  ROAD.
Stephen: AS SOMEONE USED TO  DRIVING 200 MILES AN HOUR WHEN  YOU'RE IN TRAFFIC, HOW BAD IS YOUR ROAD RAGE?
IT'S REALLY BAD. YEAH. LIKE I'M ALWAYS TOLD TO RELAX. WE'RE NOT IN A RUSH. CALM DOWN.
Stephen: DOES THE RAGE HELP  YOU? DOES THE ANGER HELP YOU AROUND  THE TRACK?
I THINK SOMETIMES WHEN YOUR  BLOOD GETS PUMPING, IT DOES HELP  A LITTLE BIT. IT BRINGS OUT SOMETHING ELSE IN  YOU.
Stephen: DO YOU HOPE YOU'RE  INSPIRING OTHER WOMEN LIKE MAYBE  THERE'S A YOUNG GIRL OUT THIS WATCHING THIS SHOW TONIGHT AND  THINKS, I'M GOING TO GO OUT AND  I'M GOING TO DRIVE 200 MILES AN  HOUR.
I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING  THAT THEY SHOULD START RIGHT  AWAY. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING  THAT I EVER WAS SHOOTING FOR  WHEN I WAS A KID GROWING UP BECAUSE I'M A KID AND I'M THE  ONE BEING INSPIRED AND TRYING TO  MAKE IT TO THE TOP. AS IT HAPPENED AND PEOPLE  STARTED ASKING ME QUESTIONS LIKE  THAT, I STARTED TO REALIZE THAT IT'S A REALLY HONORABLE ROLE. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE IT. SO WHENEVER I HAVE A CHANCE, I  ALWAYS TRY AND TAKE EXTRA TIME  FOR THE KIDS. IF I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO  SIGN I TRY TO SIGN FOR THE KIDS. GIVE THEM A FUN EXPERIENCE. FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.
Stephen: I DO THE SAME THING.   ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE  TIME FOR THE KIDS. IF A CHILD WANTS MY AUTOGRAPH  I'M LIKE NO PROBLEM $5 WE'RE  GOOD.
THAT'S COOL  Stephen: YOU'VE GOT GO-DADDY  THERE ON YOUR JACKET.
YOU NOTICED THAT. Stephen: YOU HAVE SPONSORED  ALL OVER YOUR CAR, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT  Stephen: COULD I INTEREST  YOU, COULD I INTEREST YOU  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ABSOLUTELY. I'M GOING TO MAKE THAT CALL  BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE GO DADDY  WILL BE SO HAPPY WHEN I PERFORM WELL AFTER WALKING BY MY CAR AND  PUTTING PUT IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD  WHEN I SEE THIS FACE.
Stephen: DANICA, IT WAS  CALLED THE COLBERT BUMP, ALL  RIGHT? BOOM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
