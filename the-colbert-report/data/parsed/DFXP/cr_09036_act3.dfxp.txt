(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE AUTHOR  OF BEST-SELLING BOOK "BLINK"  "THE TIPPING POINT" AND "OUTLIARS."  I'LL ASK WHAT HE READS ON AN  AIRPLANE. PLEASE WELCOME MALCOLM GLADWELL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  MALCOLM, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,  THANKS FOR COMING BACK. OLD HOME WEEK, HAVEN'T HAD YOU  ON IN A WHILE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON AGAIN.
GOOD TO BE BACK.
Stephen: YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE  YOU'RE A RENOWN AUTHOR ALREADY. YOU HAVE YOUR "BLINK" "OUTLIARS"  ALL THAT GOOD STUFF. YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK THAT YOU'VE  WRITTEN THE FORWARD BY AND HAVE  A COUPLE STORIES IN HERE OF YOUR OWN CALLED "THE BIG NEW YORKER  BOOK OF DOGS."  I'LL GET STRAIGHT TO MY PROBLEM  WITH THIS. (LAUGHTER)  OKAY? YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH  THIS, RIGHT?
I'M SURE YOU DO.
Stephen: THAT CAN'T COME AS A  SURPRISE TO YOU. THE "NEW YORKER," OKAY? YOU THINK PIECES -- YOU WRITE  THINK PIECES. WHY DO YOU WANT TO MAKE ME THINK  ABOUT MY DOG? (LAUGHTER)  I FEEL ABOUT MY DOG AND MY DOG  LOVES ME BACK UNCONDITIONBLY,  WHY RUIN THAT WITH THINKING ABOUT IT? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, THESE ARE EXCEPTIONS, I  THINK, TO THE TYPICAL "NEW  YORKER" STORY. WHEN IT COMES TO WRITING ABOUT  OUR DOGS WE LET OUR HAIR DOWN A  LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: YOU LET YOUR HAIR UP  OF COURSE. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, I WASN'T INCLUDING  MYSELF.
Stephen: WHAT WHO DOES YOUR  GROOMING, BY THE WAY? DO YOU EVER CRACK AN EGG IN  THERE TO KEEP IT SILKY?
I DON'T.
Stephen: YOU SHOULD, YOU  SHOULD. IF WE ALL LET OUR HAIR DOWN WHEN  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR DOGS--  YOU SAY "OUR DOGS" DO YOU HAVE A  DOG?
I DON'T HAVE A DOG.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE A  DOG. OKAY.
MY BUILDING DOESN'T ALLOW  DOGS. I'M AN ASPIRATIONAL DOG OWNER. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: REALLY. SO IF YOU HAD THE ABILITY YOU  WOULD OWN A DOG?
SOMEDAY I HOPE TO OWN A DOG. I GREW UP WITH DOGS.
Stephen: WERE YOU RAISED BY  WOLFES? (LAUGHTER)  GREW UP WITH DOGS?
I HAD DOGS -- MY PARENTS HAD  DOGS WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND I  DON'T KNOW -- THIS IS PERHAPS WHY I WAS ASKED TO WRITE THE  FORWARD BECAUSE I'VE DONE THINGS  ON BEHALF OF DOGS.
Stephen: I KNOW THIS.
A BUT THE YEARS AGO I SAVED A  DOG THAT WAS ON DEATH ROW IN NEW  JERSEY. AN AKITA NAMED TARO WHO HAD BEEN  WRONGLY CONVICTED, AS IT TURNS  OUT, OF BITING A YOUNG GIRL. AND I DID AN ENORMOUS EXPOSï¿½ ON  THIS. AND THE DOG WAS GRANTED A  REPRIEVE. A STAY OF EXECUTION. AND RELOCATED TO NEW YORK STATE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I FEEL I'VE LEARNED MY STRIPES  WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF  DOGS.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE SOFT ON  DOG CRIME?
YES.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT ABOUT  DOGS THAT MAKES INTELLIGENT MEN,  GIFTED WOMEN, GREAT MINDS, LOOK AT THEM AND SAY "WHO'S A GOOD  BOY?"  IS THIS THAT SOMETHING  EVOLUTIONARY INN US THAT MAKES US GOOD (SPEAKS GIBBERISH)  (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HELP BUT DO  IT.
WELL, DOGS WERE EVOLVED TO  PAY ATTENTION TO US.
Stephen: OR MADE BY GOD  PERFECTLY TO PAY ATTENTION TO  US.
THEY'RE AN EXTRAORDINARY  EXAMPLE OF A SPECIES THAT WE  HAVE BREAD ON THE BASIS OF THEIR -- OF HOW MUCH ATTENTION THEY  PAY TO US AND HOW CLOSELY THEY  LOOK A US IN THE EYE AND HOW ATTENTIVE THEY HANG ON OUR EVERY  WORD. IT'S THE MOST NARCISSISTIC THING  WE'VE EVER DONE AS HUMAN BEINGS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SO IT'S THE BEST  THING WE'VE EVER DONE. AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED,  BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE  THE SUBJECT OF THE NARCISSISM.
YES. I DOG PAYS MORE ATTENTION TO  YOUR FACE THAN A HUMAN BEING  DOES BECAUSE DOGS HAVE MUCH BETTER EYESIGHT THAN WE DO AND  THEY HAVE MUCH BETTER HEARING  AND OBVIOUSLY MUCH BETTER SMELL.
Stephen: MY DOG GIPPER AND I  ARE ALWAYS IN CONSTANT  COMPETITION AS TO WHO CAN PAY MORE ATTENTION TO ME. (LAUGHTER)  EVERYTHING HAS TO BE POLITICAL  THESE DAYS. I HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH POLITICAL IN  HERE. EVERYTHING HAS TO BE POLITICAL  IN OUR LIVES TODAY, YOU KNOW  THIS. WHAT IS THE CONSERVATIVE DOG AND  WHAT IS THE LIBERAL DOG?
WELL, THIS MAY BY ONE OF  THOSE WONDERFUL EXAMPLES THAT  DOESN'T HAVE --.
Stephen: WRONG, WRONG. THE PRESIDENT'S DOG BO IS THE  LIBERAL DOG. IT'S A PORTUGUESE WATER DOG,  OKAY? WHY NOT AN AMERICAN WATER DOG? CONSERVATIVE DOGS?
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, THAT'S A --.
Stephen: CHECKERS.
THAT WAS NIXON'S DOG.
BUT REMEMBER CHECKERS WAS  GIVEN TO NIXON BY -- THAT WAS  THE WHOLE SCANDAL. WE'RE BOTH DATING OURSELVES.
I WISH I COULD DATE MYSELF. (LAUGHTER)  AGAIN, I'M PAYING A LOT MORE  ATTENTION TO ME THAN I DOG IS. CATS WAR WAR WORSHIPPED BY  ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. DOES ANYBODY WORSHIP DOGS?
NEW YORKERS WORSHIP THEIR  DOGS. THE PARTICULAR STATUS OF THE NEW  YORK CITY DOG WHO IS PAMPERED  BUT ALSO THE SAME TIME WHOSE OWNER FEELS GUILTY ABOUT HAVING  THEIR DOG IN NEW YORK CITY. RIGHT? I MEAN, IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARILY  -- THIS RELATIONSHIP DEFINED BY  GUILT
I THINK ONE OF THE MOST  EXTRAORDINARY THINGS, THE MOST  UNIQUE THINGS ABOUT DOG IN NEW YORK IS THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE  FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE  HUMANS ALSO POOP ON THE  SIDEWALK. (LAUGHTER)
YES, THERE IS.
Stephen: THEY FIT IN. (LAUGHTER)  WELL ON THAT NOTE, MALCOLM  GLADWELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. "THE "NEW YORKER" BOOK OF DOGS."  BE A GOOD BOY AND GO
