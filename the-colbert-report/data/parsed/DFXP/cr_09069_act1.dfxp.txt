[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WHEN YOU CHANT MY NAME LIKE  THAT, YOU MAKE ME FEEL ONE TOKE  OVER THE LINE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE TOP STORY TONIGHT HAS TO BE  THE DRAMATIC NEWS COMING FROM  THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL RELIGIOUS LEADER PAT ROBERTSON. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, IN A WORLD FULL OF WAR  AND POVERTY AND MORAL DECAY, PAT  IS WILLING TO CONFIRM THE ETERNAL QUESTIONS. ON MONDAY HE DID IT AGAIN.
THIS IS KERRY WHO SAYS I BUY  A LOT OF CLOTHES AND OTHER ITEMS  AT GOODWILL AND OTHER SECONDHAND  SHOPS. MY MOM TOLD ME I NEEDED TO PRAY  OVER THE ITEMS, BIND FAMILIAR�i  SPIRITS ANPi�i�� BLESS THE ITEMS BEFORE I COME INTO THE HOUSE. CAN DEMONS ATTACH THEMSELVES TO  MATERIAL ITEMS.
CAN DEMONIC EXPERIENCE ATTACH  THEMSELVES TO INANIMATE OBJECTS  THE ANSWER IS YES BUT I DON'T THINK EVERY SWEATER YOU GET FROM  GOODWILL HAS DEMONS IN IT.
Stephen: NOT EVERY SWEATER,  JUST THE V-NECKS, ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'M ISSUING A  STEPHEN COLBERT CONSUMER ALERT. FOLKS, I WANT YOU TO HEED PAT  ROBERTSON'S WARNING BECAUSE  THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THE ITEMS YOU BUY AT GOODWILL ARE  POSSESSED BY DEMONS.   EVERYBODY KNOWS EVIL SPIRITS  ARE SUCKERS FOR RAYON SLACKS,  BROKEN BLENDERS AND CLASSIC ALBUMS LIKE KEN BY REQUEST. YOU NEED TOLL PURIFY YOUR  SECONDHAND�� CLOTHING.�i  THANKFULLY MANY SECONDHAND  CLOTHING MANUFACTURERS PRINT DETAILED DEMON BANISHING  INSTRUCTIONS ON THE TAG ALONG  WITH A SERIES OF SYMBOLS NO ONE  UNDERSTANDS. SEE IF WE HAVE ONE ON IN A SHIRT  RIGHT HERE. OKAY, TO CAST OUT LUCIFER AND  ALL OF HIS�i MINIONS, ALWAYS WASH  IN COLD, TUMBLE DRY LOW. VERY IMPORTANT. HEAT JUST SETS THE DEALON --  DEMON. AVOID RINSING OUT YOUR WIFE'S  DEMONS. MOST CAN'T GO IN THE DRYER AND  HANGING OVER THE CHAIRBACK IS  HELL. YOU WANT TO PRETREAT YOUR DOMON  GO.

[LAUGHTER] IN A RELATED STORY, FOLKS, THE  WORLD IS NOW IN UNCHARTED  THEOLOGICAL TERRITORY BECAUSE WE'RE OFFICIALLY POPELESS. WE'VE BEEN DISENPOPENATED.
WE'VE UNDERGONE A�� POPEECTOMYA5,  POPE GOES THE WEASEL. [LAUGHTER] DURING HIS LAST DAY, THE ARTIST  FORMERLY KNOWN AS POPE TENDERED  HIS RESIGNATION, SAID HIS PERSONAL FAREWELLS AND AS WITH  ALL DEPARTING POPES, THE VATICAN  RAISED HIS VESTMENTS TO THE  RAFTERS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, THIS WHOLE PAST WEEK  HAS BEEN A BIT OF A WHIRLWIND. HE DELIVERED HIS FINAL SERMON  WHICH INCLUDED�i CONTROVERSIAL  REMARKS.
HE EXPERIENCED MOMENTS OF  GREAT JOY AND GREAT DIFFICULTY  WHEN HE FELT THE LORD WAS  SLEEPING.
Stephen: EXCUSE�r ME, GOD  DOES NOT SLEEP. HE HAS TO STAY AWAKE ALL THE  TIME TO CATCH YOU MASTURBATING. ALL RIGHT. READ YOUR CATECHISM. [ LAUGHTER ] SO ON THIS MOMENTOUS NIGHT, I  WANT TO SAY THANK YOU POPE  BENEDICT FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP OF MY FAIVMENT YOU'VE DONE THE  LORD'S WORK WITH HONOR  INTEGRITY. THAT'S ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT IS HIS  POPE. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHO IS THE NEXT  TOP PONTIFF. NOBODY, NOT EVEN THE VATICAN  TAYEOR KNOWS THE -- TAILOR KNOWS  THE ANSWER.
WHOEVER IS THE CHOSEN THE  TAILORS WILL HAVE HIS GARMENTS  READY. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THEY  MAKE THREE SIZE.
Stephen: YES, THEY MAKE  THREE VESTMENT SIZES. OF COURSE, THE�i ROBES THEY DON'T  USE ARE SENT TO THE SAME PLACE  AS LOSING SUPER BOWL CHAMPION  T-SHIRTZ. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN FAVORITES  TO BE THE NEXT POPE. ACCORDING TO THE IRISH�r GAMBLING  WEB SITE PADDY POWER IS CARDINAL  PETER TURKSON OF GHANA LEADING THE PACK AT 3-1. THAT MAKES SENSE. THE CHURCH IS IN A MESS RIGHT  NOW AND THEY ALWAYS GIVE THE  CRABBY CLEANUP JOB TO THE BLACK  GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE IRISH BETTING PARLORS ARE  NOT ONLY ONES MAKING�r GREEN ON  BYE BYE BENNY.
