[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS CURATED A  NEW EXHIBITION AT MOMA THAT  INCLUDES 14 VIDEO GAMES. I SAW A VERY SIMILAR EXHIBITION  AT CHUCK E. CHEESE. PLEASE WELCOME PAOLA  ANTONELLI! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. CIAO. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M FINE, HOW ARE YOU?
Stephen: GOOD.
I'M GOOD.
Stephen: THE LATEST  EXHIBITION AT MOMA IS CALLED  APPLIED DESIGN.
INDEED.
Stephen: TELL PEOPLE WHAT  IT SHOWCASES.
OBJECTS FROM THE COLLECTION  OF MOMA IN THE 80s TO TALK  ABOUT APPLIED DESIGN. DESIGN IS SO MANY THINGS.
Stephen: WHAT IS APPLIED  DESIGN?
THE IDEA IS THAT IN THE  FUTURE DESIGN WILL GO THE WAY OF  PHYSICS. WE'LL HAVE THEORETICAL DESIGN. IT WILL BE INTERFACES, BIODESIGN  VISUAL AREASATION.
Stephen: THAT'S IN THE  FUTURE.
IT'S IN THE PRESENT. IN THE FUTURE EVEN MORE SO.
Stephen: WHERE ARE WE NOW? MODERN? POST MODERN OR PREFUTURE?
WE'RE POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS  DISORDER POST MODERN, PRESENT,  PREFUTURE BUT A LITTLE BIT OF FUTURE TODAY WITH HISTORY THAT  COMES WITH US.
Stephen: WOW. IT'S A COMPLICATED ARTISTIC TIME  TO LIVE IN.
NO, NO IT'S VERY, VERY EASY. THEY TOLD ME WHEN I CAME HERE BE  YOURSELF, BE IN THE MOMENT AND  THAT'S HOW YOU ARE.
Stephen: I SHOULD BE  MYSELF.
BE YOURSELF, BE IN THE  MOMENT. YOU'LL BE MODERN. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: IS THAT DESIGN?
OH, YES, IT IS. COULD BE BETTER BUT IT'S DESIGN.
Stephen: OKAY. OKAY. NOW WHAT IS LEFT TO DESIGN  THOUGH? BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TWO DIFFERENT  SIZES OF iPAD, AREN'T WE DONE?
PRETTY MUCH SO. I AGREE WITH YOU. WE COULD HAVE A THIRD SIZE AND A  FEW MORE. THE IDEA IS TO MAKE THE iPAD  DISAPPEAR.
Stephen: WHAT? WHAT WILL I SHOW THE PEOPLE WHO  DON'T HAVE ONE?
YOU SHOW YOUR RETINA.
Stephen: LIKE THE GOOGLE  GLASS THAT THING.
AND BEYOND WITHOUT THE  GLASSES EITHER. IT'S TO MAKE EVERYTHING  DISAPPEAR SO YOU CAN BE IN  THINGS, IN THE INTERFACES.
Stephen: GO TO THIS ONE  HERE. EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE WHAT WE  HAVE?
THIS IS A DESIGNER THAT  DECIDED TO HAVE 40,000 BEES MAKE  A BUZZ. WE TALK ABOUT RAPID PROTOTYPING  THESE DAYS. THERE'S ROBOTS THAT MAKE OBJECTS  OUT OF RESIDENTIN. THIS IS SCAFFOLD IN THE SHAPE OF  WITH HONEY ON TOP AND YOU LET  40,000 BEES GO WILD AND IN A WEEK THEY MAKE THIS.
Stephen: IS THAT MORE OR  LESS EXPENSIVE THAN HAVING  CHINESE PEOPLE DO THIS?
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
Stephen: MOVING ON. WHAT IS THIS? THIS LOOKS LIKE A CHILD'S TOY.
IT'S A CHILD'S TOY MADE TO AN  ADULT OBJECT. TO THIS IS AN AFGHANI DESIGNER DESIGNER  THAT STUDIED IN THE NETHERLANDS. HE GREW UP IN WAR TORN  AFGHANISTAN IN A PLACE WITH LAND  MINES. WITH HIS BROTHER AND FRIENDS  THEY WOULD MAKE WIND POWERED  TOYS THAT WOULD ROLL AND END UP IN THE MINE FIELDS. A FEW YEARS LATER AFTER HIS  MOTHER SMUGGLED HIM OUT OF  AFGHANISTAN HE LANDED IN THE NETHERLANDS AND STUDIED DESIGN. HE DESIGNED THIS OBJECT WHICH IS  WIND POWERED MEANT TO BE ROLLED  ON TO MINE FIELDS AND MAKE THEM  EXPLODE. IT'S QUITE FANTASTIC BECAUSE  IT'S ABOUT HIS OWN EXPERIENCE  BUT A DRAMATIC AND SERIOUS OBJECT THAT IS MEANT TO BE  MADE -- IN THE END IT WILL COST  NOTHING. RIGHT NOW TO TAKE A MINE OFF A  MINE FIELD COSTS $10,000.
Stephen: THIS GETS BLOWN  ACROSS, BLOWS UP AND IT MUST BE  AWESOME.
IT IS AWESOME.
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS LAST  ONE HERE, JIM. THAT IS JUST A TABLE.
THAT SAY TABLE FOR SCHOOL  CHILDREN IN EARTHQUAKE PRONE  IMRAIRS TO SO-WHEN YOU CEILING FALLS UPON YOU YOU DON'T GET  CRUSHED.
Stephen: WHAT MAKES IT SO  GREAT.
IT'S DESIGNED FROM A STUDENT  AT A SCHOOL IN JERUSALEM. YOU SEE HOW IT'S MEANT. THOSE ORANGE STICKS ARE LIKE  COMPRESSORS.
Stephen: SHOCK ABSORBERS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: YOUR WELCOME SO.
WHEN THE PROVERBIAL TON OF  BRICKS FALLS UPON YOU YOU DON'T  GET CRUSHED.
Stephen: HERE IS AN IDEA,  WHY NOT MAKE THE SCHOOL OUT  AFTER THIS?
WE SHOULD, YOU'RE RIGHT. ENGINEERS ARE WORKING TOWARDS  THAT.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. THE EXHIBITION STARTS
