Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY  MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. I GOTTA SAY, I LOVE THIS LITTLE  GOLDEN THING. I'M GOING TO USE IT TO SNEAK  INTO HOG WARTS TO STEAL THAT  INVISIBILITY CLOAK. FOLKS, IT IS NIGHT THREE OF  BIT WEEK.OFHO  WE'VE HAD IAN MCKELLAN, MARTIN  FREEMAN, AND TONIGHT ANDY  CIRCUS. ( APPLAUSE )  MY FIRST QUESTION WILL BE, OF  COURSE, "WHAT DO I HAVE IN MY  POCKETSES?"  SHHH! DON'T TELL. MR. CIRCUS, OF COURSE, IS THE  PIONEER IN THE ART OF  PERFORMANCE CAPTURE. HE HAS PLAYED SO MANY OF THE  GREAT COMPUTER-GENERATED  CHARACTERS, NOT JUST GOLLAN, BUT KING KONG, CAESAR FROM "PLANET  OF THE APES" AND OF COURSE  ABRAHAM LINCOLN. YOU REALLY BELIEVE IT'S DANIEL  DAY LEWIS. OF COURSE, HOBIT HEADS LIKE ME  CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE AND  LUCKILY, WE DON'T HAVE TO, THANKS TO THE WIZARDS AT DENNY'S  WHO ARE BRINGING THE SPIRIT OF  MIDDLE EARTH TO THE MIDDLE OF THE I-80 ROUTE 126 INTERCHANGE. LORD JIM.
FIRST, I WILL HAVE THE  SKILLET. NEXT, I SHALL SECURE SOME HOBIT  HOLES WITH THE SIDE OF A PUMPKIN  PANCAKE. THAT SHOULD HOLD ME UNTIL SECOND  BREAKFAST.
EAT LIKE A HOBIT, ONLY AT  DENNY'S.
Stephen:  YES, EAT LIKE A  HOBIT, BECAUSE AT DENNY'S, YOU  CAN'T EAT LIKE A HUMAN. ( LAUGHTER ). OBVIOUSLY, OBVIOUSLY, FOLKS  TOLKEN WAS AN OXFORD PROFESSOR  WHO WITH THE SIMPLE FANTASY NOVEL EXPLOREDDED LINK BETWEEN  LANGUAGE AND CULTURE AND THE  SHARED MYTHOLOGICAL THEMES. HE PROBABLY GETS THE  GANDOLF-GOBBLE-MELT. REMEMBER TO SLATHER IT WITH  GANDOLF GRAVY. OR MAYBE GET THE RING BURGER,  WHICH THE LEGENDS SAY WILL TURN  YOUR INTESTINES INTO GHOUL ( LAUGHTER )  SO BE SURE TO TRY EVERY HOBIT  MEAL. THEY'RE A DELICIOUS TRIBUTE TO A  BELOVED CHILDREN'S BOOK, THOUGH  THE BREAKFAST HAS A MUCH DARKER  ENDING. OF COURSE-- IT'S TRUE. OF COURSE, THERE'S NOTHING MORE  MAGICAL THAN THE MIRACLE OF  CHILD BIRTH. BUT ONLY IF IT'S YOUR CHILD. IF IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S, IT  LOOKS LIKE A SCENE THEY CUT TO  KEEP THE "R" RATING. WHEN YOU HOLD YOUR NEWBORN IN  YOUR ARMS AND YOU SEE THE  LITTLIZE LOOK UP AT YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU INSTANTLY KNOW  YOU GIVE THEM ANYTHING THEY  NEED-- A HOME TO LIVE IN, FOOD FOR THEIR BELLIES, ADDERRAL FOR  THEIR S.A.T.s, BECAUSE, FOLKS,  IT HAS NEVER BEEN HARD TORE GET INTO AMERICA'S TOP COLLEGES. THIS PAST SPRING, HARVARD AND  PRINCETON POSTED RECORD-LOW  ACCEPTANCE RATES WITH HARVARD ADMITTING JUST 2,000 OF THE  34,000 APPLICANTS, A RATE OF  5.9%. 5.9! REALLY? BECAUSE I CALCULATED THAT  MYSELF, AND IT'S 2,000, 34, 000,  LIKE THAT, AND I I GOT WILL BE  BOOBIES. ( LAUGHTER ). NOW, NO WONDER WORRIED PARENTS  SPEND THOUSANDS ON S.A.T. PREP  COURSES, MATH TUDORS, ENGLISH TUDORS, MANDARIN LESSONS, NOT TO  PAD THE CHILD'S RESUME BUT SO IT  CAN CLAW OUT THE EYES OF THE  COMPETITION. GOOD LUCK FILLING OUT YOUR  APPLICATION NOW. NOW, LUCKILY, THERE IS A MUCH  SIMPLER WAY TO GIVE KIDS A LEG  UP. AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S  WORD  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HIGHER LEARNING  NATION, YOU CAN GET THE BEST TUTOR MONEY CAN BUY, BUT  ULTIMATELY, THERE'S ALWAYS GOING  TO BE ONE THING STANDING IN THE WAY OF YOUR KID'S POTENTIAL. THAT OBSTACLE-- YOUR KID. BECAUSE AFTER GIVING THEM EVERY  POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE, MANY PARENTS  FIEND OUT THEIR KID DOESN'T GET INTO HAFER OR PRINCETON. WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO,  HAVE THEIR KID PACKED OFF TO  SOME TECHNICAL SCHOOL? FOLKS, THAT'S WHY THERE'S A  GROWING TREND OF PARENTS HIRING  TUTOR TO DO A LITTLE MORE THAN JUST TOOT. ACCORDING TO A RARE BIT OF  JOURNALISM IN THE "NEW YORK  POST, "THERE IS A HIGH DEMAND FOR TUDORS WHO CHEAT FOR HIRE,  LIKE CHARLES WHO NETTED $150,000  AND A DOWN PAYMENT ON HIS NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT AFTER ONE  MOTHER DEMANDED HE COMPLETE  EVERY HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT, PAPER, AND COLLEGE ESSAY FOR HER  15-YEAR-OLD SON, AND HOPEFULLY  TWO GRAND FOR PUNCHING UP THE KID'S MOTHER'S DAY CARD. THE ANONYMOUS TUDORS RANGED FROM  A WELL-RESPECTED DOCTOR TO AN  IVY LEAGUER WITH A GRADUATE DEGREE IN BIOLOGY WHICH JUST  GOES TO SHOW IF YOU STUDY HARD  AND GET INTO A GOOD SCHOOL, YOU CAN HAVE A REWARDING CAREER  STUDYING HARD AND GETTING INTO A  GOOD SCHOOL. ( LAUGHTER ). SO IT WORKS. THE KIDS GET TO GO OFF TO A GOOD  SCHOOL, AND THE PARENTS GET  SOMETHING ELSE. AS ONE TUDOR OBSERVED, WE HAVE  SOME MOTHERS WHO FEEL LIKE  THEY'VE NEVER WANTED ANYTHING SO BAD IN THEIR LIVES, THAN GETTING  THEIR KID INTO HARVARD. IT'S BRAGGING RIGHTS. YEAH. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE STUNNED  REACTIONS WHEN YOU SAY, "YOUR  KID GOT INTO HARVARD," ESPECIALLY FROM YOUR KID BECAUSE  HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE APPLIED. ( LAUGHTER ). ( APPLAUSE )  BUT WILL-- WILL YOUR CHILD  SUCCEED AT THE COLLEGE SOMEONE  ELSE GOT HIM INTO? ONE STUDENT IN THE ARTICLE  FLUNKED OUT AFTER LESS THAN ONE  YEAR. THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU SEND YOUR  KID TO COLLEGE, DON'T FORGET TO  PACK HIS TUDOR. HE'LL DO ALL THE WORK WHILE YOUR  CHILD ENJOYS THE TRUE COLLEGE  EXPERIENCE. NOW, NATURALLY, AFTER  GRADUATION, YOU'LL NEED TO KEEP  THE TUDOR ON THE PAYROLL TO GET YOUR SON THROUGH MED SCHOOL,  FOLLOWED,SH, BY A RESIDENCY IN  NEUROSURGERY. BUT, FOLKS, THERE IS MUCH MORE  TO LIFE THAN NOT REALLY WORKING. EVENTUALLY, JUNIOR HAS TO FIND  THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE. OF COURSE, NO WOMAN'S GOING TO  WANT YOUR SON. HE'S A LAZY DOLE. BUT THE TUDOR, HE'S SO SMART AND  HARD WORKING, HE'LL NAB YOU THE  AUGHTER-IN-LAW OF YOURD DREERNLINGS AND BEFORE YOU KNOW  IT, YOU'LL WANT GRANDKIDS. THAT'S JUST ANOTHER JOB FOR THE  TUDOR. YOU KNOW, COME TO THINK OF IT,  YOU MIGHT WANT TO HIRE THE TUDOR  TO BE YOUR CHILD'S MOM AND DAD BECAUSE IF YOU'VE GOT HIM FAKING  ALL YOUR CHILD'S ACHIEVEMENTS,  YOU'RE A PRETTY TERRIBLE PARENT. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
