Colbert: TONIGHT! HEY, LOOK, BEFORE WE BEGIN, I  JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO  TALK ABOUT THE ATTACK IN BOSTON  YESTERDAY. OBVIOUSLY OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR  PRAYERS ARE WITH EVERYBODY  THERE. AS THE PRESIDENT SAID, WE DON'T  KNOW WHO DID THIS, BUT THEY WILL  BE FOUND AND THEY WILL BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. BUT WHOEVER DID THIS OBVIOUSLY  DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE  PEOPLE OF BOSTON BECAUSE NOTHING THESE TERRORISTS DO IS GOING TO  SHAKE THEM. FOR PETE'S SAKE, BOSTON WAS  FOUNDED BY THE PILGRIMS -- A  PEOPLE SO TOUGH THEY HAD TO BUCKLED THEIR GOD-DAMNED HATS  ON. IT IS THE CRADLATE AMERICAN  REVOLUTION, A CITY THAT  WITHSTOOD AN 86-YEAR LOSING STREAK, A CITY THAT MADE IT  THROUGH THE BIG DIG, A  CONSTRUCTION PROJECT THAT BACKED UP TRAFFIC FOR 16 YEARS. I MEAN, THERE ARE COMMUTER JUST  GETTING HOME NOW. EVEN THEIR BANDS ARE TOUGH. IT'S THE HOMETOWN OF AEROSMITH  WHO IN THEIR FIFTH DECADE ARE  STILL GOING STRONG EVEN STEVEN TYLER LOOKS FANTASTIC, FOR A  73-YEAR-OLD WOMAN. BUT HERE'S WHAT THESE COWARDS  REALLY DON'T GET. THEY ATTACKED THE BOSTON  MARATHON, AN EVENT CELEBRATING  PEOPLE WHO RUN 26 MILES ON THEIR DAY OFF UNTIL THEIR NIPPLES ARE  RAW... FOR FUN. AND THEY HAVE BEEN HOLDING IT IN  BOSTON SINCE 1897. AND DO YOU KNOW HOW TOUGH YOU  HAVE TO BE TO RUN IN A WHALE  BONE CORSET? AND WHEN THOSE BOMBS WENT OFF,  THERE WERE RUNNERS WHO, AFTER  FINISHING A MARATHON, KEPT RUNNING FOR ANOTHER TWO MILES TO  THE HOSPITAL TO DONATE BLOOD. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   SO HERE'S WHAT I KNOW. THESE MANIACS MAY HAVE TRIED TO  MAKE LIFE BAD FOR THE PEOPLE OF  BOSTON, BUT ALL THEY CAN EVER DO IS SHOW JUST HOW GOOD THOSE  PEOPLE ARE. NOW, THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   STEVE HELLO. WELCOME TO THE REPORT,  EVERYBODY.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Colbert: THANKS, AMERICA. FOLKS, WELCOME TO THE REPORT. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, AND IF YOU  ARE A REGULAR VIEWER OF THIS  SHOW -- AND I HOPE YOU ARE -- THEN YOU KNOW THAT I CALLS 'EM  LIKE I SEES 'EM, AND I SEES 'EM  WITH POORLY STRUCTURED  GRAMMARES. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF  THE FINGER. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   FOLKS, I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU'VE  BEEN ENJOYING THE ARRIVAL OF SPRING, THE LONGER DAYS, THE  CHIRPING BIRDS, THE BLOOMING  FLOWERS. AND THE COMING PLAGUE.
SCIENTISTS ARE PREDICTING A  MASSIVE ONSLAUGHT OF CICADA BUGS  THIS YEAR SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE BROOD II CICADAS
THEY WILL INFEST THE EAST  COAST FROM NORTH CAROLINA TO NEW  YORK'S HUDSON VALLEY AND CONNECTICUT
Colbert: THERE IS NOWHERE TO  HIDE, FOLKS. WE'RE ABOUT TO FACE THE  BUG-POCALYPSE, SWARM-AGEDDON OR  AS I'M CALLING IT, BROOD II: LECH TRICK BUG-ALOO. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF  MY FINGER TO BROOD II CICADAS  NOT FOR SWARMING, NO. NOT FOR SWARMING, FOLKS. BUT THIS.
FOR 17 YEARS OF BEING DORMANT  UNDERGROUND THE CREATURES ON THE  CICADAS ARE ABOUT TO MASS. A MASSIVE GROUP NUMBERING IN THE  BILLIONS LAST SEEN IN THIS AREA  IN 1996.
Colbert: THANKS, CICADAS FOR  REMINDING ME THAT 1996 WAS 17  YEARS AGO. WHAT THE HELL? I MEAN,... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   WHERE DID THE TIME GO? I GOT TO GET STARTED ON A  401(k). HOW COULD 1996 BE THAT LONG AGO? I MEAN, SEINFELD WAS ON AND I  REMEMBER IT. JIMMY, CAN I SEE WHAT I LOOKED  LIKE IN 1996? OH, MY GOD. WHAT IS HAPPENING? WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?   ( APPLAUSE )   AM I MOLTING? NEXT UP ON TIPPY CANOE AND THE  WAGGY TOO, FOLKS, I DON'T LIKE  TO BRAG BUT I'VE HAD SEX. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   THE KIND WITH WOMEN. OF COURSE, I'M NOT ALONE. THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY IS OBSESSED  WITH INTERCOURSE, A.K.A.,  COPULATION, FORNICATION, DOING IT, MARY JANE, ANGEL DUST. THE BIG APPLE. WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE'S ALWAYS  ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THE LATEST  SEX ENHANCER APHRODISIAC OR UKRAINIAN EMAIL PROMISING TO  MAKE LADY SAY SEX BOOM BIG BIG  BIG BIG. WELL, THE CANADIANS, OUR  NEIGHBORS WHO ARE ALWAYS ON TOP,  HAVE A NEW PRODUCT TO ENHANCE  INTERCOURSE. JIM?
SEXCEREAL. THAT IS IT'S NAME. IT'S BEING BILLED AS THE WORLD'S  MOST PASSIONAL CEREAL. IT FEATURES SPECIAL NATURAL  BLENDS FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. THE PROMOS ARE PLAYFUL SHOWING A  COUPLE AT FIRST BORED IN BED. THEN THROW IN SOME SEX CEREAL  AND, OF COURSE, SOME SEX, WHICH  WE DON'T SEE. AND THE MOOD PICKS UP.
Colbert: YES, THE MOOD PICKS  UP WHEN YOU THROW IN SOME  SEXCEREAL AND SOME SEX. ITS MANUFACTURER CLAIMS IT'S  PART OF A BALANCED BREAKFAST. YOU'LL NEED THAT BALANCE WHEN  YOU'RE DOING IT IN THE BREK  FOOFT NOOK. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF  THE HAT TO SEX-CEREAL FOR MAKING  SURE WE'LL NEVER SKIP BREAKFAST (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   BY WHICH AGAIN I MEAN SEX. THE OLD 23 SKIDOO. BECAUSE AT 6:30 A.M. WITH BLEARY  EYES AND BREATH LIKE A LANDFILL  CORPSE, WHO ISN'T CHAMPING AT THE BIT TO GET BIZAY? HERE'S HOW IT WORKS
THE CEREAL BOASTS ALL NATURAL  INGREDIENTS LIKE BEE POLLEN,  WHEAT GERMAN PUMPKIN SEEDS SUPPOSEDLY ALL NATURAL  STIMULANTS FOR MEN AND WOMEN
Colbert: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO  TELL ME ABOUT PUMPKIN SEEDS. YOU SHOULD SEE HOW I CARVE A  JACK-O-LANTERN. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   NEXT, NATION, I'VE TOLD YOU  ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S RAD NEW EFFORT TO TOTALLY CONNECT  WITH US YOUNG-AMERICANS. WELL, THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE MADE THE  MOVE TO REDESIGN THEIR WEBSITE. ENTER BUZZFEED. AN ALL ENCOMPASSING SITE THAT  MIXES POLITICS, POP CULTURE AND  WEIRD NEWS FROM ALL OVER THE  WORLD.
THIS IS THE NEW SITE. ESSENTIALLY IT'S THE N.R.C.C.'S  ATTEMPT TO TAKE EVERYTHING THAT  MADE BUZZFEED WORK AND FEED IT THROUGH A PARTISAN POLITICAL  PRISM
Colbert: YES THE N.R.C.C. IS  IS TAKING INSPIRATION FROM POLL  CULTURE LIST-MAKING SITE BUZZFEED WHICH ITSELF TAKES  INSPIRATION FROM A.D.H.D. OF COURSE, BUZZFEED HAS BECOME  FAMOUS FOR HIGHLY CLICKABLE NEWS  ITEMS LIKE 18 REASONS GLASS DOORS ARE THE WORSE, 9 THINGS  SQUIRRELS ARE UP TO THESE DAYS,  AND THE 13 MOST IMPORTANT WATER COLOR NARWHALS ON ETSY. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF  MY HAT TO G.O.P. INTERNET MEME. THEY'RE A GREAT WAY TO PROMOTE  CORE REPUBLICAN VALUES LIKE  SELF-RELIANCE BECAUSE WOULDN'T THIS MEME BE SO MUCH MORE  INSPIRATIONAL IF THAT CAT CAN  HAZ EARND "CHEESE BURGER? (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   WELL, FOLKS, I'VE BEEN  INTER-SURFING THE NEW  BUZZFEED-INSPIRED N.R.C.C. SITE, AND THERE ARE TEN REASONS THIS  ADORABLE PUNDIT LOVES IT. CHECK OUT THIS ACTUAL STORY. 13 ANIMALS THAT ARE REALLY  BUMMED ON OBAMA CARE'S THIRD  BIRTHDAY FEATURING THIS BABY SEAL WITH THE LINE "OBAMA CARE  IS LEAVING JOB CREATORS OUT IN  THE COLD" OR "THIS PUPPY WITH THE LINE" THIS PUPPY IS UPSET  THAT HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS  ARE ACTUALLY $3,000 HIGHER SINCE OBAMA CARE PASSED."  I HAVE NOT SEEN SUCH AN  EFFECTIVE MIX OF BALD POLITICAL  MESSAGING AND CUDDLY ANIMALS SINCE GLOABLS' GERBILS AND THEIR  BENIGHTED SUB HUMAN RACE  POSTERS. SO BRAVO, N.R.C.C., FOR TAKING  INSPIRATION FROM BUZZFEED. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY  GOT SOME IDEAS FROM YOU TOO LIKE  THE 18 MOST EMBARRASSING REPUBLICAN YOUTH OUTREACH FAILS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
