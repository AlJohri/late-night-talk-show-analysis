Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ENGLISH. I WILL INTERVIEW HIM IN HIS NATIVE TONGUE. PLEASE WELCOME DAVID MILIBAND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MR. MILIBAND, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
Stephen: CHEERS AS WE SAY.
CHEERS.
Stephen: WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME. YOU'RE THE FOMMER BRITISH SECRETARY. YOU'RE MY FIRST CABINET SECRETARY TO COME OVER HERE. THANK YOU. IT'S AN HONOR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: WHO PUT YOU IN THE JOB?
THE PRIME MINISTER WAS GORDON BROWN AT THE TIME.
Stephen: GOOD GUY?
GOOD GUY.
Stephen: THAT'S LIKE OUR SECRETARY OF STATE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY MR. SECRETARY.
Stephen: I DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT. YOU HAVE TO SAY MADAM SECRETARY WHEN HILLARY CLINTON IS HERE. YOU'RE C.E.O. OF THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE AND YOU RECENTLY RETURNED FROM WEST AFRICA. AND THE INCUBATION PERIOD FOR EBOLA MY UNDERSTANDING IS 21 DAYS. HOW MANY DAYS AGO DID YOU RETURN FROM LIBERIA?
20. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'LL SHAKE HANDS AGAIN.
Stephen: NO, NO. ALL RIGHT. UHM-- WHY HASN'T GOVERNOR CUOMO CLAPPED YOU IN IRONS AND STUFFED YOU IN A HEFTY BAG AND HUNG YOU OFF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE? ARE YOU COMMUNICABLE RIGHT NOW?
I'M NOT COMMUNICABLE, COMMUNICATING EBOLA TO YOU, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.
Stephen: THAT IS WHAT I'M ASKING.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SAFE.
Stephen: WERE YOU HELPING PATIENTS THERE?
MY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN IN SIERRA LEONE AND LIBERIA FOR 15 YEARS HELPING PEOPLE DISPLACED BY WAR AND CONFLICT, ABOUT 35 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. THERE WAS CIVIL WAR IN SIERRA LEONE AND LIBERIA. THANK GOODNESS WE ARE THERE, 500 STAFF DEPLOYED TO FIGHT THE EBOLA VIRUS WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS, KILLED AT LEAST 5,000 PEOPLE. THE SITUATION THERE IS MANY TIMES WORSE THAN THE OFFICIAL FIGURES SUGGEST.
Stephen: BUT WHY SHOULD WE LET GUYS LIKE YOU WHO GO OVER THERE TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE-- AND THAT'S GREAT-- TO GO OVER THERE AND HELP THOSE PEOPLE, WHY SHOULD WE LET YOU BACK INTO WESTERN COUNTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE EBOLA. AREN'T YOU A DISEASE VECTOR NOW?
I'M NOT. IT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION AND LET ME ANSWER WHY. I DIDN'T GO THERE TO SEE PATIENTS. I WENT THERE TO MEET OUR STAFF, TO SUPPORT THE WORK THEY'RE DOING TO, MEET THE GOVERNMENTS THERE, TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING, SO I COULD COME BACK HERE AND GIVE PEOPLE THE REAL FACTS ABOUT THE SITUATION. WHICH IS THAT WHILE THE SITUATION THERE IS MANY TIMES WORSE THAN THE OFFICIAL FIGURES SUGGEST, THE SITUATION HERE IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, AND MANY TIMES BETTER THAN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF HYSTERIA THAT YOU'VE HEARD IN THE MEDIA AND ELSEWHERE.
Stephen: NOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE UNITED STATES AND YOU'VE SEEN OUR SITUATION HERE, HOW LONG BEFORE WE CAN GO BACK OUTSIDE AND GO BOWLING AND STUFF LIKE THAT? ( LAUGHTER ).
I WOULD LOVE TO GO BOWLING WITH YOU. GIVE ME THE DATE.
Stephen: WE CAN'T GO BOWLING BECAUSE THE GUY IN NEW YORK HE WENT BOWLING HERE IN NEW YORK. HE DID, HE WENT E-BOWLING. HE WENT E-BOWLING AND I CAN'T PUT MY HAND OVER THAT LITTLE BLOWER.
HE DIDN'T LEAVE ANY EBOLA IN THE BOWLING BALL. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT.
Stephen: IS THIS ALL YOU GUYS DO IS EBOLA? WHAT IS YOUR FOCUS?
OUR FOCUS IS WHEREVER THERE IS WAR, CONFLICTS AND DISASTER WE GO THERE WITHIN 72 HOURS TO HELP ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, WATER AND SANITATION AND EVENTUALLY, BECAUSE THESE CIVIL WARS GO ON FOR YEARS, HELP PEOPLE WITH ECONOMIC LIVELIHOOD TO STAND ON THEIR OWN FEET IN THE MIDST OF TERRIBLE CONFLICTS. AND I'M VERY, VERY PROUD THAT WE GOT 12,000 STAFF AROUND THE WORLD, AMERICANS, BUT ALSO MAINLY PEOPLE FROM THOSE COUNTRIES, WHETHER IT'S HELPING WITH EDUCATION IN AFGHANISTAN, WHETHER IT'S GETTING MEDICAL SUPPLIES INTO SYRIA. THESE ARE LOCAL PEOPLE WHO WE'RE EMPLOYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE MOST WAR-TORN, MOST VULNERABLE, THE MOST DANGEROUS PARTS OF THE WORLD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WHAT IS THE MOST WAR-TORN, MOST DANGEROUS PART OF THE WORLD RIGHT NOW?
AT THE MOMENT IT'S SYRIA. IT'S A COUNTRY OF 22 MILLION PEOPLE. 10.6 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES. THREE MILLION REFUGEES IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. IN JORDAN, YOUR SECOND CLOSEST ALLY IN THE REGION, COUNTRY OF SIX MILLION PEOPLE, OVER A MILLION REFUGEES. THAT'S LIKE THE WHOLE OF BRITAIN COMING TO AMERICA. JUST IMAGINE --
Stephen:  THEY TRIED THAT AND WE KICKED THEIR ASS.
EXACTLY.   ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: GLOBALLY, HOW MANY REFUGEES ARE THERE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW?
EVERY FOUR SECONDS A PERSON IS DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOME, WHETHER INSIDE THEIR OWN COUNTRY OR OVER A BORDER, 52 MILLION PEOPLE LAST YEAR. A WORLD RECORD. WORLD RECORD.
Stephen: WHAT IF THEY ALL CONVERTED TO JUDAISM? DOESN'T ISRAEL HAVE TO TAKE THEM?
THE TRAGEDY IT IS A LOT ARE LEFT IN REFUGEE CAMPS, IN URBAN AREAS, LEFT IN LIMBO. THEY'RE ALMOST LEFT WITHOUT A FUTURE AT ALL AND OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE WE GIVE THEM A MODICUM OF DIGNITY, WE HELP THEM SURVIVE. WE HELP THEM TRY AND GAIN SOME CONTROL OVER THEIR SHATTERED LIVES.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE A DANGEROUS JOB AT TIMES.
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS. AND THE COURAGE, ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN OVER LAST YEAR, I'VE BEEN IN THIS JOB FOR ABOUT A YEAR, THE MOST INSPIRING THING IS THE COURAGE OF OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS WHO SAY EVEN WHEN THEIR COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN KILLED, WE'VE HAD TRAGICALLY EARLIER THIS YEAR IN SOUTH SUDAN, THE FAMINE SITUATION ON THE HORIZON, WE HAD TWO PEOPLE KILLED, TWO OF OUR STAFF KILLED, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE INSIDE A U.N. COMPOUND. AND I WENT TO VISIT SOME OF THE SURVIVORS, AND THE-- A WOMAN IN CHARGE OF OUR TEAM IN SOUTH SUDAN HAD JUST COME BACK FROM VISITING HER FAMILY IN UGANDA, AND SHE SAID TO ME, "I'M DETERMINED TO COME BACK BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE HERE DESERVE SOME HELP." AND THAT'S THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING FOR US. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF PEOPLE I THINK MAKE A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD.
Stephen: WELL, IF YOU DO DECIDE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT.
WILL THE COLBERT NATION BECOME PART OF RESCUE NATION?
Stephen: OR THAT'S AN INTERESTING THING. THE SHOW IS ENDING IN DECEMBER. THE COLBERT NATION NEEDS SOMETHING TO DO. WHAT IF THEY BECAME PART OF RESCUE NATION?
TAG UP AT THE I.R.C., VISIT RESCUE.ORG, THE WEB SITE, JOIN THE EFFORT TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD.
Stephen: THANK YOU, DAVID. DAVID MILIBAND, INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU.
