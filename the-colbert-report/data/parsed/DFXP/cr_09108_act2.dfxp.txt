Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  ESH. THANKS SO MUCH, FOLKS. FOLKS, AS AMERICA'S MOST FAMOUS  CATHOLIC,IM THE POPE OF BASE OF  BASIC CABLE. I WAS READY TO EMBRACE THE NEW  PONTIFF FRANCIS. BIG DADDY FRANK. THE LEAN, MEAN, ARGENTINE. THE VICAR SO NICE, HE SPEAKS FOR  CHRIST. I TRIED TO FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE  WHEN HE WASHED THE FEET OF THE  POOR I WENT ONE STEP FURTHER AND SENT SOME HOMELESS GUYS THROUGH  A CAR WASH, EVEN PAYING FOR THE  WAX. BUT AS A DEVOUT MEMBER OF THE  HOLY ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, MY  SCAPULAR IS IN A BIT OF A TWIST  TODAY. OVER WHAT HIS HOLINESS SAID IN  HIS HOMILY YESTERDAY.
( translated ): THE  COMMANDMENTS THAT JESUS GAVE TO  US IS TO DO GOOD, AND REDEMPTION CONCERNS EVERYONE, NOT JUST  THOSE WHO WHO BELIEVE IN JESUS. THE LORD REDEEMED ALL OF US, NOT  JUSTICALS, AT THE BLOOD OF  CHRIST. EVERYONE, EVEN ATHEISTS.
Stephen:  WHAT THE PLUCK? EVEN ATHEISTS? I AM A CATHOLIC. AND I AM A CATHOLIC SO I CAN  HAVE THE FAST TRACK PARADISE  EASYPASS BECAUSE I AM IN COMMUNION WITH THE ONE TRUE  CHURCH. IN WORD THE 1-3 SCANNER,  MEMBERSHIP HAS ITS PRIVILEGES. IF THE LORD REDEEMS ATHEISTS,  ALL BETS ARE OFF? WHAT'S NEXT? THE LORD REDEEMS LUTHERANS? IT'S MADNESS. I FEEL LIKE A CHUMP. I WAS AN ALTAR BOY FOR 11 YEARS. I PUT SOME MILES IN ON MY KNEES,  ALL UPON UPIN' AND DOWNIN' AND  CRISSIN' AND CROSSIN'. HEY, COLBERT, YOU HAVE A STAMP  ON YOUR HEAD. I THOUGHT IT WAS A HAND STAMP  FOR HEAVEN. SOME GODLESS GO GUY CAN SWOOP IN  AT THE 11th HOUR AND GET  REDEEMED? I WANT A REFUND. YOU KNOW WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE  WITH ALL THOSE HOURS AT CHURCH? I COULD HAVE LEARNED SLIDE  GUITAR. ( LAUGHTER )  I COULD HAVE BECOME FLUENT IN  THAI. "KA PRA NUK NO GAAH."  THAT MEANS, NOTHING BECAUSE I  NEVER LEARNED THAI. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  AND I JUST THINK-- I JUST THINK,  FRANCIS, MAYBE SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT BELIEVING IN  GOD WAA OPTIONAL. BECAUSE-- NEWS FLASH ! -- IT'S  RIDICULOUS. AN INVISIBLE WIZARD CREATED THE  HEAVENS AND THE EARTHS IN SIX  DAYS? TOOK ME A MONTH JUST TO STAIN MY  DECK! ( LAUGHTER )  NOW, NORMALLY, FOLKS, IN A TIME  OF TRIAL LIKE THAT I WOULD TURN  TO GOD FOR GUIDANCE. BUT I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER  ANYMORE. SO I MIGHT AS WELL TURN TO THIS  STAPLER. SO ACCORDING TO THE POPE, THAT'S  JUST AS GOOD. ( LAUGHTER )  OH, ONE TRUE OFFICE SUPPLY. I AM SO CONFUSED. HELP ME. WHAT SHOULD I DO? I'M A BUDDHIST. IN MY NEXT LIFEI'M HOPING TO BE  A FAX MACHINE. I'M JUST SO GLAD JESUS DIDN'T  LIVE TO SEE THIS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
