WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW I LOVE BEAUTY PAGEANTS IT IS SO REFRESHING TO SEE A TV SHOW THAT CELEBRATES ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE. AND NO PAGEANT IS MORE AMERICAN THAN THE MISS AMERICA PAGEANT. AFTER ALL UNTIL THE 1930s IT'S HOW OUR COUNTRY CHOSE THE FIRST LADY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OF COURSE WHEN FDR CAME INTO OFFICE HE CHANGED THE LAW SO THE PRESIDENT MERELY MARRIED WHATEVER COUSIN COULD LIFT THE LARGEST PALLET OF BRICKS. NOW LAST NIGHT THE MISS AMERICA PAGEANT WAS HELD IN ATLANTIC CITY. SO OF COURSE THE JUDGES WERE STEVE BUSCEMI AND MR. MONOPOLY. (LAUGHTER) NOW I AM PROUD SON OF SOUTH CAROLINA. AND THIS YEAR MISS SOUTH CAROLINA REPRESENTED OUR STATE ADMIRABLY.
FROM OUR HOME THAT'S HOW WE ROLL, MISS SOUTH CAROLINA.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. 20% OF OUR HOMES ARE MOBILE, WHICH MEANS THEY COULD LEAVE SOUTH CAROLINA AND YET THEY CHOOSE TO STAY. THAT IS PALMETTO PRIDE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OR, OR, OR POSSIBLY A LACK OF GAS MONEY. (LAUGHTER)
BUT MISS SOUTH CAROLINA HAS SOME TOUGH COMPETITION THIS YEAR FROM CONTESTANTS LIKE MISS KANSAS WHO BOLDLY SPORTED A SERENITY PRAYER ON HER RIB CAGE. NOT EVERYONE WAS THRILLED BY IT AS PIERS MORGAN LEARNED AFTER THIS NECK STAPPING MID BROADCAST SUBJECT CHANGE.
A COMPLETE SEGUE FROM ONE RED LINE TO ANOTHER, A RED LINE WITH CROSSING THE WORLD OF BEAUTY PAGEANTS IN MISS MERCK WE HAD TERESA VEIL WHO SPORTED A VERY LARGE TATTOO. WOULD YOU EVER ALLOW SUCH A THING IN YOUR PAGEANTS?
WE DON'T ENCOURAGE IT I'M NOT A FAN OF TATTOOS. I HAVE SEEN MANY PEOPLE GET THE TATTOOS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON NOWADAYS BUT EVERYONE IS GETTING TATTOOS. MANY OF THEM REGRET IT LATER ON.
Stephen: CLEARLY DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT BELIEVE IN ANY BODY MODIFICATION. I MEAN--  (LAUGHTER) HE-- HE HAS NOT-- HE HAS NOT CHANGED A THING SINCE THE DAY HE WAS BORN. HE'S STILL BABBLING UNINTEL I BELIEVEABLY AND COVERED IN ORANGE GOO. THOUGH I THINK, I THINK, I THINK AND I MEAN THIS AS A FRIEND, DONALD, IT'S TIME TO TAKE THE PLAS ENTA OFF YOUR HEAD. NOW  UNFORTUNATELY-- UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, THE CROWN DID NOT GO TO MY BELOVED HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. INSTEAD IT WENT TO MY BELOVED OVER HOME STATE.
YOUR NEW MISS AMERICA IS MISS NEW YORK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THERE SHE IS, A BEAUTIFUL LADY, NINA DAV YOU WILL LUREI THE SECRETARY CONTESTANT FROM NEW YORK TO WIN THAT PAEJT. THE 24-YEAR-OLD IS ALSO THE FIRST MISS AMERICA OF INDIAN DESCENT.
Stephen: THE FIRST TIME A WOMAN OF INDIAN DESCENT HAS WON THE CROWN AND I FOR ONE COULD NOT BE HAPPIER FOR HER. AND TWITTER AS USUAL COULD NOT BE HAPPY. JIM.
RACIST BACKLASH POPPED UP ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHEN TWITTER GUYS LOTS OF RACIST REACTION TO THIS CHOICE.
SOME PEOPLE CALLING HER A FOREIGNER, AN ARAB, EVEN A TERRORIST AND UP SET THIS HAPPENED SO CLOSE TO THE 9/11 ANNIVERSARY.
WE'VE BEEN TRACKING THE COMMENTS, 705 TWEETS, ACTUALLY REFERENCING MISS AMERICA TERRORIST.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. 705 PEOPLE SAW A WOMAN IN A BIKINI AND THOUGHT MUSLIM EXTREMIST. (LAUGHTER) I FOR ONE, I FOR ONE CONDEMN (LAUGHTER) I FOR ONE, I FOR ONE CONDEMN THIS TWITTER BACKLASH AS PURE XENOPHOBIC REACTIONARY HATESPEECH WHICH WOULD BE COMPLETELY FINE IF SHE WERE AN ARAB. BUT SHE'S NOT. MISS AMERICA, 2014 IS INDIAN, AND THAT IS AN INSPIRING STORY. BECAUSE MANY MOONS AGO WHITE MEN CAME TO THE NEW WORLD, CONQUERED THE INDIAN'S LAND AND GAVE THEM NOTHING BUT BEADS AND DISEASES. BUT THIS ONE BRAVE-- .
STEPHEN.
WHAT IS IT, I'M WAXING POETIC.
SHE'S NOT AMERICAN INDIAN, SHE'S FROM INDIA, IN ASIA? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OH, OKAY. WELL THEN COLUMBUS WAS RIGHT. ANYWAY--  (APPLAUSE) I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO MISS AMERICA NINA DAVULURI. THANKS TO YOU YOUNG INDIAN GIRLS CAN NOW DREAM OF ADVOCATING WORLD PEACE IN A TWO PIECE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
