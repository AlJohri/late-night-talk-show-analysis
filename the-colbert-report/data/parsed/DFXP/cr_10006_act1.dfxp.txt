Stephen:  TONIGHT, IS MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION HERE TO SAY, OR IS IT JUST CRASHING ON OUR COUPLE FOR A WHILE? THEN, HOLIDAY HORRORS-- IT WASN'T MAGIC IN THAT OLD SILK HAT THEY FOUND. IT WAS A HUMAN HEAD. AND MY GUEST, PAUL GIAMATTI, STARS IN A NEW FILM "PARKLAND" ABOUT THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION. I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, SO NO SPOILERS. A NEW WIFI TEA KETTLE WILL TEXT YOU WHEN YOUR WATER BOILS. THE TEXT READS, ," WHY THE HELL DID YOU LEAVE YOUR HOUSE WITH THE KETTLE ON." THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT.    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THAI.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEEPEN. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. ALL RIGHT, FOLKS. HELLO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN THE TELEVISION VIEWING AUDIENCE, IF YOU ONLY KNOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) NATION, IT IS DAY 8 OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. TOMORROW, OF COURSE, IS DAY 10 BECAUSE 9 HAS BEEN FURLOUGHED. FOLKS, THIS SHUTDOWN HAS MADE ME FEEL ALL WARM AND FUZZY INSIDE. ALTHOUGH, THAT COULD JUST ABE REACTION FROM UNINSPECTED SHRIMP. ( LAUGHTER ) THE POINT IS, THIS SHUTDOWN HAS BEEN MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING SO FAR. BUT THE TIMMY "TITANICS" OUT THERE ARE SCREAMING ICEBERG AGAIN. BECAUSE UNLESS A DEAL IS STRUCK ON OCTOBER 17, AMERICA WILL REACH ITS TET CEILING AND OUR NATION COULD DEFAULT, AND SURPRISE, SURPRISE-- THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BAD, TOO ( LAUGHTER ).
WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WASHINGTON THE THE RESERVE CURRENCY OF THE WORLD, PAYMENTS HAVE STOOG OUT TO PEOPLE. IF MONEY DOESN'T FLOW IN, THEN MONEY DOESN'T FLOW OUT.
IT WOULD BE A CALAMITY BECAUSE ALMOST EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD IS PRICED OFF TREASURES. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF PAPER IN THE WORLD AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, NOT JUST THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, DEPENDS FUNDAMENTALLY, ON THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. THIS WOULD BE ECONOMIC ARMAGEDDON.
Stephen:  OH, ECONOMIC ARMAGEDDON. BIG DEAL. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WHEN HALLOWEEN ROLLS AROUND, THE LITTLE HOBO KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR MIGHT BE AN ACTUAL HOBO. ( LAUGHTER ) AT LEAST HE'LL REALLY APPRECIATE THAT MINI SNICKERS. FOLKS, I BELIEVE IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE FOR THESE DOOM-CRYERS TO PANIC YOU. FIRST OF ALL, YOU'LL NEED THAT RESERVE ENERGY TO FIGHT FOR POTABLE WATER AND CANNED GOODS. PRO TIP-- YOU CAN MAKE A GREAT SHIV OUT OF A SHARPENED FRUIT ROLL-UP. ( LAUGHTER ) SECOND, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEFAULT. WE JUST WON'T DEFAULT. THERE ARE WAYS OF NOT DEFAULTING, EVEN IF YOU DON'T RAISE THE DEBT CEILING. IT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA SCARING THE CRAP OUT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
I DON'T THINK THE CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO BE COLLAPSED. I THINK ALL THIS TALK ABOUT A DEFAULT HAS BEEN A LOT OF DEMAGOGUERY, A LOT OF FALSE GEM GOGRY.
THIS ISN'T SO FATAL. WE CAN KIND OF GO ON FAIR WHILE DOING THIS. IT'S LAUGHABLE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  SEE, IT'S LAUGHABLE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY-- TRAGEDY PLUS TIME EQUALS COMEDY. AND WE'VE GOT ANOTHER NINE DAYS BEFORE THE TRAGEDY, SO IT'S STILL HILARIOUS. FOLKS, WITHOUT A DEBT CEILING INCREASE, THE PRESIDENT WILL JUST HAVE TO PICK WHICH PROGRAMS GET FUNDED. DO WE FUND VETERANS' PROGRAMS OR HEADSTART MEALS FOR KIDS? THE ONLY FAIR THING TO DO IS TO PUT THEM IN A PIT AND MAKE THEM FIGHT IT OUT. AND SO WHAT? SO WHAT IF THE DOLLAR IS NO LONGER THE WORLD CURRENCY ANYMORE? WE'LL JUST REPLACE IT WITH THE EURO, OR SUBWAY CLUB CARDS, OR THE TEETH OF CHILDREN. I MEAN, THE TOOTH FAIRY'S ALWAYS IN THE PLARKT FOR THOSE THINGS, AND SHE PAYS CASH. IN FACT, DEFAULTING ON OUR DEBT COULD, JUST COULD BE BENEFICIAL. ACCORDING TO FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN TED YOHO WHO I BELIEVE REPRESENTS OF THE "PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN" RIDE.
CONGRESSMAN TED YOHO REPUBLICAN OF FLORIDA SAYS BY REFUSING TO RAISE THE SO-CALLED DEBT LIMIT CONGRESS WOULD HAVE THE REVERSE EFFECT OF BRINGING STABILITY TO WORLD MARKET.
Stephen:  YET, A GOVERNMENT DEFAULT COULD BRING STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS, JUST LIKE IF YOU CUT OFF BOTH YOUR LEGS, IT BRINGS STABILITY TO YOUR TORSO. BECAUSE IT LOWERS YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY. ANYWAY, NATIONWIDE, RIGHT NOW, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE DANGEROUS SIDE EFFECTS OF A POPULAR DRUG. BUT FIRST LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION? WHO HERE SMOKES WEED? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SADLY, ONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTES OF MARIJUANA USE IS MINDLY HOLLERING WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD "WEED." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU SEE THIS SHAMEFUL TURN OF EVENTS IS ALREADY HITTING MY STUDIO. AMERICA IS SURRENDERING IN THE WAR ON DRUGS. 21 STATE HAVE LEGAL IDTW MARIJUANA FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES, AND JUST LAST YEAR, IT WAS MADE LEGAL FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES IN COLORADO AND WASHINGTON STATE. OR SHOULD I SAY CHEECH-ARADO AND WASHING-CHONG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN ALL TWO OF THOSE STATES, THE COPS HAVE STOPPED CRACKING DOWN TO O SPARKING UP.
SEATTLE POT SMOKERS ARE GETTING AN EDUCATION THIS WEEK. IN AN EFFORT TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT THE STATE'S NEW MARIJUANA LAWS, SEATTLE POLICE WENT TO THE ANNUAL FESTIVAL KNOWN AS HEMP FEST, AND THEY PASSED OUT BAGS OF DREETS DROOETOZE WITH THE DO'S AND DON'TS OF GETTING HIGH IN THE STATE. AMONG THE TIPS-- KIND OF OBVIOUS-- DON'T DRIVE HIGH. DON'T SMOKE POT IN PUBLIC. BUT IT SAYS DO LISTEN TO "DARK SIDE OF MOON" AT A REASONABLE VOLUME. ( LAUGHTER )#A!
Stephen:  WHAT? POLICE SHOULD NOT BE ENCOURAGING DRUG USE. AND YOU CANNOT LISTEN TO "DARK SIDE OF THE MOON" AT A REASONABLE VOLUME. YOU WILL MISS ALL THE DEPTH FROM THE SONG MONEY, FROM 7-4, TO 4-4, AND GILMORE LAYS DOWN A SLICK SOLO BASE ON THE PENT TONIC SCALE, IS WHAT I'M TOLD BY ONE OF MY EDITORS. ( APPLAUSE ) WORST OF ALL, FOLKS, DESPITE POT POSSESSION BEING A FEDERAL CRIME, ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER SAYS HE IS WILLING TO LET THESE PRO-POT LAWS INTO EFFECT. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM THE MAYOR OF CLOUD CITY? ( LAUGHTER ) THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ONLY HAS ONE DON'T DO FOR YOUR DOOBY-DO.
THE D.O.J. RULING ON THURSDAY THAT THE STATES CAN LET PEOPLE SMOKE, GROW, AND BUY POT LEGALLY. AS LONG AS THE TRUCK IS KEPT AWAY FROM KIDS AND USED SAFELY.
Stephen:  SAFELY? HOW CAN YOU KEEP TODAY'S MEDICAL-GRADE DISPENSARY DAIFNG AWAY FROM KIDS WITH FUN NAMES LIKE ALIEN DOG AND BUBBA-KUSH. THEY ALREADY SOUND LIKE STONER HEROES FOR A CARTOON NETWORK. JUST IMAGINE THE ADVENTURES THEY'D HAVE ON THEIR COUCH WATCHING CARTOON NETWORK.�i FOLKS, IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT POT IS NO LONGER BAD FOR URS. THE DOPE PUSHERS ARE NOW TRYING TO TELL US IT'S THE SOLUTION FOR ALL OUR FISCAL PROBLEMS, LIKE THE MICHIGAN STATE LAWMAKER WHO IS PROPOSING TO LEGALIZE AND TAX MARIJUANA TO BOOST FUNDING FOR ROAD REPAIR IN THE PLAN SUPPORTERS CALLED "POT FOR POTHOLES." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, MAYBE THAT WOULD WORK, BUT ONCE THEY FIX EVERY POTHOLE, WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'LL LEGALIZE TO FIX EVERY CRACK? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).��
