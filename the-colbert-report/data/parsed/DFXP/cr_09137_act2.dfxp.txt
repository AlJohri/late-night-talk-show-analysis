WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, BEFORE I GO ON I WANT  TO THANK HUGH JACKMAN FOR  SAVING ME DURING THE  COMMERCIAL BREAK. I JUST WISH WE HAD CAMERAS  ROLLING. NATION, THERE'S NO DEBATE  THAT RONALD REAGAN WAS OUR  GREATEST PRESIDENT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE  REAGAN LEGACY ALIVE. THAT'S WHY THERE ARE NEARLY  3,000 LANDMARKS IN THE  UNITED STATES ALREADY NAMED  AFTER THE GIPPER. INCLUDING THE RONALD REAGAN  BUILDING AND INTERNATIONAL  TRADE CENTER, THE USS RONALD REAGAN NUCLEAR AIRCRAFT  CARRIER, AND THE RONALD  REAGAN AIRPORT IN  WASHINGTON, D.C., A CITY NAMED FOR OUR FIRST  PRESIDENT WHO I BELIEVE  SHOULD BE RENAMED THE RONALD  REAGAN GEORGE WASHINGTON. NOW UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE  STILL MANY KNOWNS OUT THERE  THAT ARE NOT PRECEDED BY ITS WORDS "RONALD REAGAN"  BUT THE MEMORY OF OUR BEST,  GREATEST PRESIDENT MIGHT BE  GETTING BESTER AND GREATESTER THANKS TO  CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVE  AND DEFINITELY NOT A  CONTRACT KILLER DARELL ISSA. MR. ISSA NEW BILL WITHOUT  RENAME THE WATERS OFF THE  COASTAL U.S., PRETTY OF ALL OF THOSE WATERS, ACTUALLY,  AFTER MR. REAGAN. THIS SLICE OF THE WORLD  RIGHT HERE INCLUDES THE  UNITED STATES AND ITS  TERRITORIES IT. THERE IN THE DARK GREEN. AND THE AREAS IN BLUE  EXTENDING FROM 3 TO 200  NAUTICAL MILES OFFSHORE ARE  CALLED THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE. DARRELL ISSA WANTS TO RENAME  THEM THE RONALD WILSON  REAGAN EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC  ZONE.
Stephen: FOLKS, LET'S  THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE. I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THE OCEAN  WAS CONSERVATIVE LIKE THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT'S FULL OF GREAT WHITES. AND--   (LAUGHTER)  I THINK IT IS ALSO ONLY FAIR  DNS --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE'VE GOT A REPUBLICAN CROWD  HERE TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT. BACK IN 1983 IT WAS THE  GIPPER HIMSELF WHO SIGNED A  PROCLAMATION DECLARING THOSE WATERS THE UNITED STATES  EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE FOR  EXPLORING, EXPLOIINGT AND  CONSERVING OFFSHORE RESOURCES AND IT'S BEEN  GOING GREAT, ESPECIALLY THE  EXPLORING AND EXPLOITING  PART. AND I'M SURE WE'LL GET  AROUND TO THE CONSERVING  PART LATER. NATURALLY THE BERLIN WALL  HUGGERS OUT THERE SEE THE  RONALD WILSON REAGAN  ECONOMIC ZONE AS HALF EMPTY. LIKE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT  ALAN LOWENTHAL.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 3.4  MILLION SQUARE MILES OF  OCEAN. AN AREA LARGER THAN THE  COMBINED LANDMASS OF ALL 50  STATES.
PRESIDENT REAGAN'S NAME  ALREADY GRACES ROADS,  SCHOOLS, BUILDINGS AND  FIELDS IN 22 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. NOT TO MENTION A MAJOR  AIRPORT, AND A NUCLEAR  POWERED-AIRCRAFT CARRIER. BUT NAMING THE ENTIRE EEC  AFTER ANYONE SEEMS A BIT  MUCH.
Stephen: OH SO, WE CAN'T  NAME PART OF THE WATER AFTER  OUR GREATEST PRESIDENT BUT IT'S OKAY TO NAME ALL OF IT  AFTER 80s R&B STAR BILLY  OCEAN. (LAUGHTER)  COME ON! ♪ GET OUT OF MY GREEN ♪  ♪ AND GIVE ME A BREAK ♪  ♪ WHY IS THERE THIS  OBJECTION TO NAMING A HUGE ARBITRARY PORTION OF OUR  NATURAL RESOURCES AFTER  REAGAN? I SAY THERE IS NO PLACE ON  EARTH TOO LARGE OR TOO  ARBITRARY TO HONOR THE  GIPPER'S LEGACY. S THIS'S WHY DON'T I'M PROUD  TO DECLARE THAT THE AREA  BETWEEN FOUR AND SEVEN FEET OFF THE GROUND BE RONALD  WILSON REAGAN ECONOMIC  BREATHING ZONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: RIGHT UP THERE. THIS, FOLKS, THIS IS THE  STORIED SWATHE OF AMERICAN  ATMOSPHERE WITHIN WHICH RON ADD REAGAN'S VERY OWN MOUTH  WAS OFTEN FOUND. SHARING ITS LIFELONG  DEDICATION TO THE GREATEST  OXYGEN IN THE WORLD. THAT'S WHY HE'S FRESH INSIDE  THE RONALD WILSON REAGAN  ECONOMIC BREATHING ZONE IS TAKEN IN HONOR OF HIM. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE HONOR YOU, RONNIE. WE MISS YOU, SIR. THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR. THIS ONE IS FOR ITS GIPPER. TEAR DOWN THIS WALL. HE ATE JELLY BEANS. YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM FEELING A LITTLE WOOZY. I THINK I MIGHT SIT DOWN IN  THE WALTER MONDALE DON'T  STAND UP FOR AMERICA ZONE. AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK  AFTER THIS RONALD REAGAN  COMMERCIAL BREAK. (CH
