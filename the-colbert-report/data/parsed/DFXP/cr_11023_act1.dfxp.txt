Stephen: TONIGHT, NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN DRONES. I HEAR THEY'VE GOT ONES NOW THAT CAN CARRY A PILOT. THEN, A REPUBLICAN VICTORY IN COLORADO. TIME TO BREAK OUT THE BUBBLY, WHICH IS WHAT THEY NAMED THEIR SKULL BONG. MY GUEST MacARTHUR GENIUS FELLOW TERENCE TAO SAYS HE LEARNED TO LOVE MATH FROM "SESAME STREET." THAT'S WHERE I LEARNED TO LOVE COOKIES AND HIDING IN TRASH CANS. KOBE BRYANT HAS SET THE N.B.A.'S ALL-TIME RECORD FOR MISSED SHOTS, BUT REMEMBER, KOBE, YOU ALWAYS MAKE 100% OF THE SHOTS YOU DON'T MISS. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME TO THE REPORT. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS, THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ON THIS CRISP FALL NIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HOPE THAT I'VE MADE THIS CLEAR OVER THE YEARS, BUT I LOVE NEW YORK CITY. BECAUSE EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING IN NEW YORK IS BIGGER. WE'VE GOT THE TALLEST BUILDINGS, THE RICHEST BANKERS, THE RACIST-EST CABBIES. IN NO OTHER CITY DO THE DRIVERS EVEN KNOW THE PROPER ETHNIC SLUR FOR PEOPLE FROM MALTA. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S FEATHERHEAD, BY THE WAY. BUT THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT NEW YORK THAT IS NOT AS BIG AS WE THOUGHT.
IT APPEARS THAT A PARTICULAR DEMOGRAPHIC IN NEW YORK HAS BEEN EXPONENTIALLY OVERESTIMATED-- THE RAT POPULATION. COMMON LORE STATES THERE ARE AS MANY RATS AS HUMANS IN NEW YORK CITY, IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF EIGHT MILLION. HOWEVER A STATISTICIAN FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SAYS THERE ARE REALLY JUST TWO MILLION RATS IN THE BIG APPLE.
Stephen: NEW YORK HAS ONLY TWO MILLION RATS? I MEAN, THAT'S LIKE FINDING OUT NEW YORK ONLY HAS TWO MILLION ORIGINAL RAY'S PIZZAS. ( LAUGHTER ) SOME COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY BRAINIAC ARRIVED AT THIS ESTIMATE BY EXTRAPOLATING THE NUMBER OF RAT-OCCUPIED LOTS IN THE CITY USING COMPLAINTS FROM THE PUBLIC ABOUT RAT SIGHTINGS. APPARENTLY, SOME NEW YORKERS ARE STILL UNJADED ENOUGH TO ALERT SOMEONE WHEN THEY SEE A RAT. ( LAUGHTER ) I BET IT'S THE DAMN FEATHERHEADS. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL NEW YORKERS WHEN I SAY, "STEP IT UP, RATS." TWO MILLION? THOSE ARE CHICAGO NUMBERS. COME ON! THIS IS NEW YORK CITY. WE HAVE A REPUTATION TO UPHOLD. THIS IS THE CITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU HEAR THAT? WE ARE THE CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID THAT IF WE NOD OFF, A RAT WILL BIRTH ITS YOUNG IN OUR OPEN MOUTHS. WHERE DID YOU RATS GO, NEW JERSEY? WHY? BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER AND YOU HAVE A NICE YARD WITH PLENTY OF SPACE TO EAT YOUR YOUNG? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU GOTTA STAY IN THE CITY. THAT'S WHERE THE ACTION IS. THAT'S WHERE THE CULTURE IS. YOU CAN INFEST THE MOMA. YOU CAN INFEST THE MET. THERE ARE WAY BETTER RESTAURANT ICE MACHINES FOR YOU TO POOP IN. SO GET IT TOGETHER, RATS, OR-- I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS-- WE MAY STOP LEAVING MOUNTAINS OF LOOSELY BAGGED GARBAGE ON THE SIDEWALK FOR YOU TO FEAST ON. ( LAUGHTER ) NATION,YOU KNOW I LOVE DRONES. THEY SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE TO OUR ENEMIES THAT WE WILL HUNT THEM TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH, AS LONG AS WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE TAMPA. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THESE DAYS, LIKE A CONVOY OF S.U.V.s IN YEMEN, DRONES ARE BLOWING UP. SO IT'S TIME FOR MY LONG-RUNNING DRONE APPRECIATION SEGMENT-- "STEPHEN COLBERT'S AUTO-ROBOTIC FIXATION." PEOPLE LOVE THIS SEGMENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). PEOPLE HAVE LOVED THIS SEGMENT FOR YEARS. FOLKS, FIRST UP, DRONES GET A BAD RAP AS CREEPY SURVEILLANCE TOOLS THAT MONITOR OUR EVER MOVE. GOOD NEWS-- NOW THEY'RE WATCHING US HAVE SEX. IT'S ALL PART OF A NEW VIRAL VIDEO CALLED "DRONE BONING." JIM?
THERE'S THE SWEEPING DRONE SHOT OF THE BEAUTIFUL VINEYARD, AND THERE'S THE BONING! AND HERE'S AN AERIAL SHOT OF AN ABANDONED SEASIDE FORT, AND BONING RIGHT UP THERE.
Stephen: WELL, FOLKS, AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ART BUT I KNOW THIS HAS PEOPLE HAVING SEX IN IT. AS ONE OF THE FILM'S DIRECTORS SO POETICALLY PUT IT, WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY TO HAVE THESE SIMPLISTIC BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES AND HAVE PEOPLE ( BLEEP ) IN THEM? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FUNNY AND PROFOUND. BECAUSE SIMPLISTIC BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES WITH PEOPLE ( BLEEP ) IN THEM WAS GOD'S ORIGINAL CONCEPT FOR EARTH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THE FILM'S DIRECTORS-- I AGREE. I AGREE. THE FILM'S DIRECTORS ARE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT A SEQUEL, I HOPE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF BONE DRONING -- "AERIAL VENEREAL." ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, I HAVE ONLY ONE ISSUE WITH THIS OSCAR-WORTHY PIECE OF BIRD'S-EYE PORN-- SOMEONE HAD TO STEER THE DRONE OVER ALL THOSE NAKED PEOPLE. WOULDN'T IT BE COOLER IF DRONES COULD FIND YOU HAVING SEX ON THEIR OWN? WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK BECAUSE DARPA-FUNDED RESEARCHERS HAVE TESTED A DRONE THAT CAN LEARN AND ACT ON ITS OWN. THE DRONE PROVED IT COULD LEARN BY FLYING INTO A SERIES OF UNFAMILIAR ROOMS IN WHICH SENSOR DATA FROM THE WALLS, FURNITURE AND OTHER OBJECTS TRIGGERED IT TO REPORT IT WAS  IN A NEW SPACE AND CAUSED THE WAYS ITS NEURONS CONNECTED TO  ONE ANOTHER TO CHANGE IN A CRUDE MIMIC OF LEARNING IN A REAL BRAIN.  AND THE NEXT TIME THE CRAFT ENTERED SAME ROOM,  IT RECOGNIZED IT. FOLKS, THIS WOULD BE A FOOL-PROOF PLAN TO GET THE TERRORISTS, AS LONG AS THEY NEVER REDECORATE. ( LAUGHTER ) DARPA, DARPA FUNDED THE RESEARCH SO DRONES COULD MAKE SENSE OF VIDEO AND SENSOR DATA FOR THEMSELVES INSTEAD OF ALWAYS HAVING TO BEAM IT DOWN TO  EARTH FOR ANALYSIS BY COMPUTERS OR HUMANS. OH, WELL THAT'S GREAT. THEN WE'RE OFF THE HOOK. NOW IF WE ACCIDENTALLY BOMB A WEDDING, YOU CAN'T BLAME US. IT WAS OUR SELF-AWARE FLYING RUMBA'S DECISION. FOLKS, AS MUCH AS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DOWN SIDE TO ARMING MACHINES, RELEASING THEM INTO THE SKIES, AND LETTING THEM DO WHAT THEY WANT, ONE THING ABOUT THIS GIVES ME PAUSE.
TESLA C.E.O. ELON MUSK SOUNDING THE ALARM OVER  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
ELON MUSK SAYS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO US ALL.
WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WE ARE SUMMONING THE DEMON.
Stephen: OH, THAT IS RIDICULOUS. THE ONLY WAY TO SUMMON THE DEMON IS TO DRINK THE BLOOD OF A LIVE GOAT INSIDE A CANDLELIT PENTAGRAM-- OR SO I AM TOLD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT, YOU KNOW, ELON MUSK IS A BILLIONAIRE. HE MUST BE RIGHT. SO TONIGHT I AM TAKING A STRONG STAND AGAINST-- WHAT!
STEPHEN, STOP TALKING.
Stephen: FUTURE STEPHEN, WHAT'S WRONG?
EVERYTHING'S FINE. THE FUTURE'S AWESOME. HEY, MAN, WOULD YOU BY ANY CHANCE HAVE A STEEL MESH COLANDER BACK THERE?
Stephen, OF COURSE, THAT'S HOW I STRAIN PASTA DURING COMMERCIALS.
OH, THANK GOD! IT BLOCKS THE SIGNALS OF THE SURVEILLANCE DIODE.
Stephen: WHOSE SIGNAL?
THE AUTONOMOUS DRONE OVERLORDS WHO CONQUERED OUR PLANET SHORTLY AFTER YOU FOOLS TAUGHT THEM TO RECOGNIZE WHEN THEY'VE BEEN IN A ROOM BEFORE.
Stephen:  SO ELON WAS RIGHT? RIGHT! I CALL HIM ELON. HE'S A FRIEND. DRONES ARE A DANGEROUS AND MALEVOLENT FORCE--
SHHH! WHENEVER YOU DENOUNCE THE DRONES HERE IN THE PAST, IN THE FUTURE, THEY PUNISH ME. THEY WHIP ME WITH LASER CHAINS. OH, I'D BETTER GO. I CAN FEEL THEM CRACKING THE GEOMETRIC INTERFERENCE PATTERN OF THIS WILLIAMS-SONOMA PASTA STRAIRN.
Stephen: WAIT! I NEED TO KNOW ONE THING-- IN THE FUTURE, IS THERE STILL  DRONE BONING?
STEPHEN THE ONLY WAY THEY LET US HAVE SEX IS IF THEY CAN WATCH. IN THE FUTURE, THERE IS ONLY DRONE BONING. AGGH! LASER CHAINS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SO, LIKE I'VE ALWAYS SAID, AUTONOMOUS DRONES ARE GREAT. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, MY WATER IS BOILING, SO IT'S TIME FOR A COMMERCIAL BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
