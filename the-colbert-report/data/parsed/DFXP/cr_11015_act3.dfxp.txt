Stephen:  WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A HARVARD PROFESSOR WHO SAYS  WONDER WOMAN IS THE MISSING LINK OF THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT.  SORRY GLORIA STEINEM, YOU SHOULD'VE HAD MAGIC WRIST CUFFS PLEASE WELCOME JILL LEPORE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING ON HERE. YOU'RE A PROFESSOR OF AMERICAN HISTORY AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY. YOU'RE A STAFF WRITER FOR THE NEW YORK. YOUR BOOK OF AGE IS THROUGH THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD AND YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE SECRET HISTORY OF WONDER WOMAN. WHAT IS THE HISTORY. WE KNOW SHE'S AN AMAZONIAN QUEEN.
SHE'S A PRINCESS. WE KNOW BECAUSE -- [LAUGHTER] THEY HAVE LEFT ANCIENT GREECE TO REPLACE WITH JOURNEYMEN AND A PLANE CRASHES ON PARADISE ISLAND 1941. AND THE U.S. MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER NEEDS TO BE SAVED SO PRINCESS DIANA LEAVES THE ISLAND, GIVES UP THE CROWN.
Stephen:  WE'RE TALKING 1941.
1941.
Stephen:  OKAY. SHOULD A 73 YEAR OLD WOMAN BE WEARING AN OUTFIT LIKE THAT.
I THINK LIKE THE ETERNAL LIFE KIND OF RUBBED OFF. LIKE AN ANTI-AGING AFTER EFFECT.
Stephen:  WAS SHE A FEMINIST ICON OR WAS THERE EVEN A THING CALLED THAT AT THE TIME.
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY A THING CALLED THAT. THE THING THAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE SECRET OF WONDER WOMAN IS FIRST OF ALL I NEVER KNEW ANY OF THIS. I WAS NEVER A COMICS PERSON. BUT THE OLDEST FEMALE COMIC SUPER HERO WHO HAS LASTED THIS LONG. SUPERMAN STARTS IN 1938. BATMAN 1939, BAT WOMAN NEVER BEEN OUT OF FRANCE SHE JOINS THE JUSTICE SOCIETY IN 1942. THEY HAVE A LOT OF READERS. A WOMEN ISN'T ALLOWED TO JOIN THE JUSTICE SOCIETY.
Stephen:  SHE'S ALLOWED TO JOIN.
SHE'S VOTED IN. ONLY EIGHT KIDS VOTED AGAINST HER. IT'S A WALK-OFF.
Stephen:  I UNDERSTAND WHEN SHE'S FIRST ELECTED TO THE JUSTICE SOCIETY SHE'S THE SECRETARY.
YES, THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen:  SHE'S THE SECRETARY TO THE JUSTICE SOCIETY.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen:  DOES SHE KICK A LITTLE ASS TO GET OUT OF  THAT JOB BECAUSE I WOULD BE ANGRY IF I WERE WONDER WOMAN.
IT'S PRETTY ROUGH. THE GUY WHO CREATED WONDER WOMAN IS THIS HARVARD PH.D. PSYCHOLOGIST NAMED WILLIAM MARSTON
Stephen:  THAT'S MY NEXT QUESTION IS HOW CAN SHE BE A FEMINIST ICON WHEN SHE WAS CREATED BY THIS MAN MARSTON
HE SAID WONDER WOMAN IS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROPAGANDA FOR THE NEW TYPE OF WOMAN I BELIEVE SHOULD RULE THE WORLD. [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  WHAT DOES FEMINISM MEAN AT THIS TIME.
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT MARSTON CREATING WONDER WOMAN IN 1941 IS SHE'S REALLY A THROW BACK. HE HAD GONE TO COLLEGE IN THE 1910s AND WAS REALLY INSPIRED BY THE SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT. WOMEN GAINED THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE 19TH AMENDMENT IN 1920. HE WAS A FRESHMAN IN HARVARD IN 1911 WHEN THE GREAT SUFFRAGISTS EMMELINE PANKHURST CAME TO  CAMPUS. HARVARD BANNED HER  FROM SPEAKING ON CAMPUS, THEY  DIDN'T LET WOMEN SPEAK ON CAMPUS AT THE TIME. SHE GAVE THIS ADDRESS IN HARVARD SQUARE IT WAS INCREDIBLY ROUSING.  HE MARRIED HIS CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART WHO WENT TO MT HOLYOKE WHICH WAS A HOTBED OF SUFFERAGE IN THE 1910s. HE BECOMES A PROFESSOR AND TEACHES  AT TUFTS UNIVERSITY IN 1925. MY ALMA MATER, TUFTS UNIVERSITY. [APPLAUSE] AND FALLS IN LOVE WITH ONE OF HIS STUDENTS WHO HAPPENS TO BE THE NIECE OF MARGARET SANGER WHO FOUNDED THE BIRTH CONTROL MOVEMENT. SHE MOVES INTO THE FAMILY AND THEY ARE POLYAMOROUS.
THIS GUY WHO IS A FEMINIST HAS GOT TWO WOMEN ONE OF WHOM IS AN UNDERGRADUATE HE'S TEACHING AND HIS WIFE IS COOL WITH THAT?
SO OLIVE BYRNE IS THE DAUGHTER OF ETHEL BYRNE, WHO IS MARGARET SANGER'S SISTER. THEY ARE NURSES AND IN 1914, MARGARET SANGER FOUND THE WOMAN REBELS, A FEMINIST NEWSPAPER SORT OF AN ANTECEDENT OF WONDER WOMAN. THEY OPENED THE FIRST BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC IN THE U.S. IN BROOKLYN AND THEY ARE ARRESTED FOR OBSCENITY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T  TALK ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL. THEY COINED THE PHRASE. ETHEL BYRNE GOES ON A HUNGER STRIKE IN JAIL PLANNED PARENTHOOD WAS FOUNDED IN 1916 BY ETHEL BYRNE AND MARGARET SANGER. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen:  SO THE GUY WHO CREATED WONDER WOMAN HAS A WIFE AND A GIRL ON THE SIDE WHO HE KNOWS IS ON BIRTH CONTROL.
YES. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen:  SO THE PLAYGROUND IS OPEN, ALL RIGHT.
HE SAYS TO HIS WIFE, YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE HER TO LIVE WITH US AND I REALLY LOVE HER AND YOU COULD, EITHER SHE COULD LIVE WITH US, SHE COULD TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN AND YOU COULD GO TO WORK, IT'D SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS.
Stephen:  AS A WOMAN HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT. WOULD YOU BE INTO THAT. WOULD YOU BE DOWN FOR THAT?
NO. THERE'S NO OTHER ANSWER.
Stephen:  NO.
THERE'S NO OTHER ANSWER.
Stephen:  I'M MORE OF A FEMINIST THAN YOU ARE. [CROWD CHEERING]
EXACTLY.
Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  JILL LEPORE, THE SECRET HISTORY OF WONDER WOMAN.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
