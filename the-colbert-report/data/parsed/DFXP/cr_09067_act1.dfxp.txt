[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, EVERYONE IN HERE  WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. DOMINUS VOBISCUM. FOLKS, AS THE CARDINAL OF CABLE,  I'M GIVING YOU NAVE TO NARTHEX  COVERAGE OF POPE BENEDICT'S RESIGNATION IN MY NEW SERIES  "POPEWATCH: INDE-SCHISM 2013." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REMEMBERS -- REMEMBERS FOLKS --  REMEMBER, IT HAS BEEN OVER 700  YEARS SINCE ANYONE HAS VOLUNTARILY DEPOPED  THEMSELVES. [LAUGHTER] WELL, BUCKLE YOUR CHAUSABLE,  BECAUSE THERE ARE  DRAMATIC NEW DEVELOPMENTS. WE ALL KNOW THAT WHEN A CARDINAL  IS ELEVATED TO THE PAPACY, HE  BECOMES THE HEIR OF ST. PETER THERE CHOOSE A NEW NAME. SO, NATURALLY, NOW THAT BENEDICT  XVI IS LEAVING OFFICE, HE HAS  ASKED THAT WE CALL HIM SIMPLY: BENEDICT THE XVI. [LAUGHTER] OKAY. OKAY. THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE TO GET  NEW TOWELS AND STUFF. [LAUGHTER] BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. HE SAYS HE'S STILL GOING TO BE  POPE EMIRITUS AND HIS HOLINESS,  CONTINUE TO WEAR THE WHITE ROBES AND LIVE IN THE VATICAN. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, THAT MEANS THERE'S GOING  TO BE TWO PONTIFFS. WE'RE ONE POPE OVER THE LINE--  SWEET JESUS, ONE POPE OVER THE  LINE. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'LL BE CHAOS. YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE VATICAN WITH  TWO POPES. IT'S LIKE GOTHAM WITH MULTIPLE  BATMANS. [LAUGHTER] YOU SHINE THE BAT SIGNAL, ALL  THESE CLOWNS SHOW UP. [LAUGHTER] I MEAN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOLY SAUSAGE FEST! [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AFTER ALL, I MEAN --  I MEAN, WHICH ONE'S INFALLIBLE? SAY YOU'RE HAVING A SMOKE BREAK  IN THE APSE, AND THE TWO OF THEM  START WALKING TOWARDS YOU FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. YOU'RE GETTING DOUBLE-POPED-- [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW D-P'ED-- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THINK ABOUT THIS --  WHICH POPE DO YOU BOW TO AND  WHICH ONE DO YOU  JUST GO "SUP?" [LAUGHTER] AND IMAGINE THE CONFUSION IN THE  BREAKROOM FRIDGE WHEN THERE'S  MORE THAN ONE YOGURT LABELED "POPE." [LAUGHTER] I'M SO WORRIED. I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT THIS. AS AN OBSERVANT CATHOLIC, ---6-  BUT, TO THE MAN'S CREDIT, HE'S  NOT HOLDING ONTO ALL THE TRAPPINGS OF POWER.
HE'LL TRADE IN HIS FAMOUS RED  SHOES, THE PRADA RED SHOES, FOR  A PAIR OF HAND-CRAFTED BROWN LOAFERS OUT OF MEXICO.
Stephen: OKAY, RED SHOES ARE  GONE. MEANING HE IS NO LONGER ABLE TO  TRANSPORT HIMSELF TO KANSAS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS IS SIGNIFICANT, I THINK  HE'S LOSING THE SYMBOL OF HIS  OFFICE.
ON FEBRUARY 28TH, THEY WILL  TAKE AWAY HIS RING. THE SYMBOL OF HIS AUTHORITY  AND DESTROY IT.
Stephen: SO, I GUESS IT IS  OVER AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT  NOTHING. BECAUSE THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY  PROBLEM WITH A REALLY OLD PERSON  LOSING HIS RING OF POWER. [LAUGHTER]�i  HE LOOKS GOOD. NATION, IF THERE'S ONE THING THE  REELECTION OF BARACK OBAMA  PROVED, IT'S THAT DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS ARE MAKING IT HARDER  FOR THE GOP TO WIN NATIONALLY. APPARENTLY IN 2012, MINORITY  VOTERS JUST DIDN'T CONNECT  WITH THE REPUBLICAN MESSAGE OF "STOP THIEF!" [LAUGHTER] THE MAN BEHIND OBAMA'S MINORITY  OUTREACHAROUND WAS JEREMY BIRD,�i [LAUGHTER] WHO FOCUSED ON FACE-TO-FACE  COMMUNICATION WITH CORE OBAMA  SUPPORT GROUPS, NONWHITES UNMARRIED WOMEN, AND  MILLENNIALS. BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW MUCH  MILLENNIALS LOVE TWO  FACE-TO-FACE COMMUNICATION. [LAUGHTER] WELL, NOW BIRD HAS SET HIS  SIGHTS ON A NEW TARGET.
TEAM OBAMA'S FORMER NATIONAL  FIELD DIRECTOR JEREMY BIRD, ONE  OF THE MASTERMINDS BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S REELECTION VICTORY  HAS DECIDED HIS NEXT JOB WILL BE  TURNING TEXAS BLUE WITH A NEW GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION  BATTLEGROUND TEXAS.
YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERED ONE OF  THE BATTLEGROUND STATES. ALTHOUGH THAT'S GON' BE CHANGING  SOON.�r
Stephen: YEAH, THAT'S 'GON'  BE CHANGING EVEN FASTER THAN  OBAMA'S ACCENT! [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, THIS MEANS THE DEMOCRATS  ARE  MESSING WITH TEXAS! A, I BELIEVE THAT'S  UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND B, I  BELIEVE IT MIGHT WORK.
TEXAS IS ONE OF FOUR MAJORITY  MINORITY STATES, AND ITS 9.5  MILLION HISPANICS, CURRENTLY 38% OF THE POPULATION.
JUST 4.1 MILLION HISPANICS  ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE, AND ONLY  ABOUT HALF MAKE IT INTO THE VOTING BOOTH.
Stephen: WHICH MEANS IF  JEREMY BIRD CAN GET THESE  MINORITIES TO THE POLLS TEXAS REPUBLICANS MAY SOON BE  SAYING THE  SPANISH WORD FOR "ADIOS." [LAUGHTER] SO CAN THIS JEREMY BIRD  CHARACTER ENACT HIS SINISTER  PLAN TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION THROUGH THE DIRTY, UNDERHANDED  TRICK OF VOTING? [LAUGHTER] HERE TO TELL ME IS THE FIELD  DIRECTOR OF OBAMA 2012 AND THE  FOUNDER OF BATTLEGROUND TEXAS JEREMY BIRD. JEREMY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US. GOOD TO SEE YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, JEREMY, LET'S TALK TURKEY  FOR A SECOND. HOW MUCH OF THIS IS BLUSTER? CAN YOU REALLY�i FLIP TEXAS? BECAUSE THERE'S A DAMN GOOD  CHANCE BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION  THEY WILL --
THIS IS DEFINITELY MORE THAN  BLUSTER. IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE, IF YOU  LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS IT'S  THE STATE THAT IS CHANGING. THE COUNTRY IS CHANGING.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN  CHANGING?
A MORE DIVERSE STATE. IT'S BECOMING A LOT MORE YOUNG  PEOPLE. WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT AND EXPAND  THE ELECTORATE. GET THE NEW VOTERS, REGISTER  THEM, BRING THEM INTO THE  PROCESS. THE FOLKS REGISTERED TO VOTE AND  NOT TURNING OUT IN TEXAS WE'RE  GOING TO BUILD A GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN AND TURN IT INTO A  COMPETITIVE BATTLEGROUND STATE.
Stephen: IF YOU DO THAT,  THAT WILL UPSET THE NATURAL  ORDER OF THINGS. WE KNOW IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION  THAT OHIO AND FLORIDA GET TO  PICK THE NEXT PRESIDENT. DO YOU NOT BELIEVE IN THE  CONSTITUTION?
IN TEXAS IF YOU GO THERE AND  TALK TO VOLUNTEERS. I'VE SEEN THE�� VOLUNTEERS WHETHER  IT'S IN EL PASO DRIVING UP  TOWARDS NEW MEXICO OR CALLING DOWN THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON  TEXAS. WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE FIGHT  TO TEXAS AND MAKE THE A  BATTLEGROUND STATE SO THAT ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO BE THE  COMMANDER IN CHIEF, THEY HAVE TO  FIGHT FOR TEXAS.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN  THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS ARE  HAPPENING? THAT'S JUST LIBERAL YOU'VE MIXES  FOR HISPANICS AND BLACK PEOPLE D  YOU'VE MS.IMS DEUPHEMISMS FOR HISPANICS AND BLACK PEOPLE. IF YOU LOOK. [LAUGHTER]
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE IT'S  NOT JUST ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS  IT'S THE TURNOUT. ONLY 54% OF THE LATINOS WERE  REGISTERED TO VOTE AND ONLY 35%  TURNED OUT. WITH ONLY 50% OF A POPULATION  TURNS OUT TO VOTE YOU GET A  GOVERNMENT IN TEXAS. IT FOR HALF THE PEOPLE AND BY  HALF THE PEOPLE. WE PLAN TO CHANGE THAT IT'S NOT  THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT IN THE  FUTURE IT'S THE FOLKS THERE IN THE FUTURE.
Stephen: YOU ARE REACHING  TOUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND  HISPANICS?
OF COURSE, AND YOUNG PEOPLE,  WOMEN, ACROSS THE STATE.
Stephen: YOU ARE A RACIST.
WHAT I WANT TO DO IN TEXAS IS  MAKE THE PEOPLE THERE PART OF  DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. GET EVERYBODY IN THE STATE TO  TURN OUT AND VOTE SO THAT THE  GOVERNMENT REFLECTS THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS.
Stephen: IS VOTER I.D. GOING TO STOP YOU. RICK PERRY BEHIND THE VOTER I.D. LAW, ISN'T HE?
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE THE  WAY REPUBLICANS HAVE  GERRYMANNEDERED IT.
Stephen: IT'S AN UGLY WORD. IT'S EXTREMELY ACCURATE BUT UGLY  WORD.
THE LAWS THEY PUT IN PLACE  MAKE IT HARD TO VOTE. WE'RE GOING TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO  VOTE, FIGHT TOUR THEIR VOTING  RIGHTS AND TURN THEM OUT IN  FORCE.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO  MAKE A BET? $100?
YES.
Stephen: I BET YOU $100 YOU  CANNOT GET BARACK OBAMA  REELECTED IN 2016. JEREMY BIRD,
