Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  "REPORT," EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," GOOD TO  HAVE YOU. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! SIT DOWN! FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,  WITH A GREETING LIKE THAT --  WITH A GREETING LIKE THAT -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, YOU  MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A ROCK STAR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND, FOLKS, YOU'RE HERE ON A  VERY SPECIAL NIGHT! AND DO YOU KNOW WHY? THAT'S A TRICK QUESTION. EVERY NIGHT ON THIS SHOW IS  SPECIAL. (LAUGHTER)  LET'S JUST SAY THAT TONIGHT I AM  SPORTING SOME SERIOUS NORWEGIAN  WOOD BECAUSE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  MY GUEST IS SIR PAUL McCARTNEY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SIR PAUL, OF COURSE, ONE OF THE  MOST SUCCESSFUL AND INFLUENTIAL SONG WRITERS OF ALL TIME. UP THERE WITH GILBERT AND  SULLIVAN, ROGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN  LENNON AND McCARTNEY. (LAUGHTER)  WE ALL KNOW SIR PAUL'S SONGS  "YESTERDAY," "HAY, JUDE"  "ELEANOR RIGBY" "BLACK BIRD "GET GET BACK" ALL IN ALL, SOME OF  THE MOST TIMELESS SONGS EVER  BOUGHT BY MICHAEL JACKSON. (LAUGHTER)  IN 2009, THE GUINNESS BOOK OF  WORLD RECORDS NAMED PAUL  McCARTNEY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SONGWRITER OF ALL TIMES. HE'S LIKE LEE REDMOND IF HIT  RECORDS WERE FINGERNAILS. (LAUGHTER)  IN FACT, THE FIRST ALBUM I EVER  BOUGHT WITH MY OWN MONEY WAS  GORDON LIGHT FOOT'S "DON QUIXOTE ♪ THROUGH THE WOODLAND, THROUGH  THE VALLEYS COME THE HORSEMEN  WILD AND FREE ♪  STILL, BLEW MY MIND. BUT THE SECOND ALBUM WAS "HEY,  JUDE."  THAT'S RIGHT, KIDS, THAT'S  RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOUNG PEOPLE, PEOPLE USED TO BUY  MUSIC. '70s WERE A CRAZY TIME. (LAUGHTER)  ALTHOUGH HE'S OFTEN CALLED A  LIVING LEGEND, SIR PAUL'S RISE  TO FAME BEGAN AS A SIMPLE TALE OF A 15-YEAR-OLD LEFT-HANDED  GUITARIST WHO DROPPED BY A  GARDEN PARTY TO SEE THE  QUARRYMEN. HE JOINED THE BAND THAT BECAME  THE BEATLES THEN CONQUERED THE  WORLD PLANTING APPLE SEEDS WITH BABE, THE BIG BLUE OX. EVENTUALLY PAUL LEFT THE BEATLES  TO JOIN THE ARGONAUTS. (LAUGHTER)  EVENTUALLY THROWING ALL OF HIS  GOLD RECORDS INTO MOUNT DOOM. (LAUGHTER)  AND I CANNOT WAIT FOR TONIGHT'S  PERFORMANCES. YOU NAME AN INSTRUMENT AND PAUL  CAN PLAY IT: GUITAR, KEYBOARD,  BASS, DRUMS. HE'S A ONE-MAN KARAOKE BAR  WITHOUT THE WEIRD VIDEOS OF  KOREAN KIDS STEALING FISH. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, SIR PAUL'S PRESENCE HERE  TONIGHT DOES NOT MEAN I AM GOING  TO RUN TONIGHT'S SHOW ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN USUAL. HE MAY BE A GIANT, BUT THIS IS  "THE COLBERT REPORT" NOT THE  McCARTNEY RECARTNEY. I'M GOING TO TREAT HIM THE SAY  WAY I TREATED LAST NIGHT'S GUEST  AUTHOR DANIEL BERGNER IN THAT I WON'T READ PAUL'S BOOK, EITHER. (LAUGHTER)  I-- AND I ALONE-- BUT, BY THE  WAY, BERGNER DID A GREAT  ACOUSTIC SET LAST NIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  SHOULD HAVE TAPED IT. I CALL THE SHOTS IN THIS  BUILDING AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY  IT IS, OKAY? I LET SIR PAUL KNOW, IT'S A HALF  SHOWER SHOW, WE HAVE TIME FOR  ONE SONG. HE IMMEDIATELY AGREED TO DO AN  HOUR-LONG SHOW WITH SIX SONGS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW --  (LAUGHTER)  AND I SAID "YES, SIR, SIR."  (LAUGHTER)  SO I TOLD HIM WE REHEARSED AT 5:00 AND TAPE AT 7:00. THERE'S SIMPLY NO OTHER WAY TO  DO IT. HE SAID HE HAD TO LEAVE BY 4:00,  WE'LL BE TAPING AT 3:00 WHICH IS  7:00 SOMEWHERE IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN SO I CALLED THAT A WIN FOR  OUR SIDE. I EXPLAINED THE TAPING SO EARLY  WOULD MEAN WE'D NEED HIM HERE  FOR 11:00 A.M. FOR REHEARSAL AND HE AGREED TO GET HERE WHEN HE  GOT HERE. (LAUGHTER)  AND AS WITH ANY MUSICAL GUEST WE  HAVE TO SECURE THE BROADCAST  RIGHTS TO THEIR SONGS, CLEAR THE LYRICS WITH LEGAL AND, OF COURSE  NAIL DOWN OUR LIGHTING AND  CAMERA ANGLES SO I TOLD SIR PAUL WE ABSOLUTELY HAD NO-NO IN  ADVANCE WHAT SONGS HE'D BE  PLAYING. HE SAID "I UNDERSTAND  COMPLETELY. I'LL DECIDE WHEN I GET THERE."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HE SHOWED UP, RIGHTING? HE'S HERE? OKAY, GOOD. ANYWAY, YOU PEOPLE ARE THE  LUCKIEST STUDIO AUDIENCE OF ALL  TIME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  DIG IT. DIG IT, DADDY-O. THIS IS GOING TO BE A 150-PERSON  PAUL McCARTNEY CONCERT. YOU HEAR THAT, OPRAH? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU, OPRAH, YOU AND YOUR FREE  CARS CAN SUCK IT! (LAUGHTER)  NOW, FOLKS, OF COURSE OUT THERE  IN THE NON-FREE PAUL McCARTNEY  PRIVATE CONCERT WORLD THEY'RE STILL SIFTING THROUGH THE  BLOCKBUSTER REVELATIONS ABOUT  THE N.S.A.'S CYBER SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM PRISM. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHOSE  INTERNET PRIVACY HAS BEEN  VIOLATED ARE SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT ANYTHING ON THE INTERNET  WAS EVER PRIVATE. AND NOW THE MAN AT THE CENTER OF  THE STORM, LEAKER EDWARD SNOWDEN  HAS GOTTEN BAD NEWS.
BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON, THE  NATIONAL SECURITY CONTRACTOR  WHERE SNOWDEN WORKED FOR THREE MONTHS AT ITS HAWAII OFFICE  CONFIRMING HE'S BEEN FIRED.
Stephen: OOH, FIRED! (LAUGHTER)  THAT CAN'T BE EASY IN THIS JOB  MARKET. PLUS, HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY  REFERENCES. HE ONLY HAS ALL OF YOURS. (LAUGHTER)  NOW AMONG SNOWDEN'S LEAKS IS THE  PAPER THAT SAYS THE N.S.A. COLLECTED 97 BILLION PIECES OF  INTELLIGENCE FROM COMPUTER  NETWORKS WORLDWIDE IN MARCH, 2013 ALONE. BUT 97 BILLION? THERE'S NO BUILDING BIG ENOUGH  TO HOLD ALL THAT DATA! AT LEAST UNTIL THEY FINISH THIS  ONE.
THESE PICTURES ARE AMAZING,  THE COMPOUND IS FIVE TIMES  LARGER THAN THE U.S. CAPITOL. ALL TO STORE BIG DATA.
THERE WILL BE YOTTABYTES OF  DATA. PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH  GIGABYTES. A YOTTABYTE IS A MILLION BILLION  GIGABYTES. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: NOW TO PUT THAT IN  PERSPECTIVE: JUST ONE YOTTABYTE  IS EQUIVALENT TO 200 TRILLION  D.V.D.s. WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY  D.V.D.s I'M BEHIND ON "GAME OF  THRONES."  (LAUGHTER) SO NO ONE TELL ME ABOUT THE RED  WEDDING. (LAUGHTER)  NOW I HAVE TO ADMIT, AT FIRST I  FOUND THIS PROGRAM TO BE A  SHOCKING BREACH OF THE PUBLIC  TRUST. THE INTIMATE DETAILS I SHARE  FROM MY GMAIL ACCOUNT ARE NO  BUSINESS OF BIG GOVERNMENTS. THEY ARE FOR ONE PURPOSE ONLY:  SO I CAN GET TARGETED ADDS FOR  BONER PILLS. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, THEN I LEARNED THAT PRISM  TARGETS ONLY FOREIGNERS! YEAH. EVIDENTLY THAT TORCH OF FREEDOM  IS ONLY FOR AMERICANS. FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD SHE'S  HOLDING BOOM MICS. (LAUGHTER)  NOW TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE  LIMITING THEIR SEARCHING IS  NON-AMERICANS, PRISM'S DATA ANALYSTS WOULD KEY IN SEARCH  TERMS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO  PRODUCE AT LEAST 51% CONFIDENCE IN A TARGET'S FOREIGNNESS. IT WAS SIMPLE, THEY USED SEARCH  TERMS AMERICANS WEREN'T FAMILIAR  WITH SUCH AS "PORTION CONTROL" "PAID MATERNITY LEAVE" AND  "GOOOAAAL."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, THIS IDEA OF FOREIGN SURVEILLANCE REALLY STRIKES A  CHORD WITH ME, PARTICULARLY  BECAUSE I'VE GOT A GUEST TONIGHT WHO STRIKES CHORDS  PROFESSIONALLY AND I AM 51% SURE  HE IS FOREIGN. FOR ONE THING, AN AMERICAN WOULD  NEVER SAY "ALL YOU NEED IS  LOVE."  WHAT ABOUT NACHO CHEESE? THAT'S WHY TONIGHT TO KEEP AN  EYE ON THIS GUY I'VE GOT CAMERAS  AND MICROPHONES ALL OVER THIS  STUDIO. DON'T TELL HIM! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SIR  PAUL McCARTNEY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
