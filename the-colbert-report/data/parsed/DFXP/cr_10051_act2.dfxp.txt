(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. NOW, NATION, YOU KNOW ME: I ALWAYS LIVE MY LIFE TO THE FULLEST. I NEVER WASTE A SINGLE PRECIOUS MOMENT EXPLAINING MYSELF OR EXPLAINING THE WAY I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE MOMENTS AND DON'T WASTE ANY OF THEM WITH EXPLANATIONS. (LAUGHTER) NONE. THE MOMENTS, I MEAN. (LAUGHTER) NOT GONNA DO IT. BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE EVEN I NEED TO REMEMBER TO MAKE SURE MY LIFE-STYLES ARE CRANKED TO LOCO-TURBO-MAX. THAT'S WHY I WAS I WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS.
HELLO, MY NAME IS FREDERICK AND I WORK WITH TIKKER, THE WRISTWATCH THAT COUNTS DOWN YOUR LIFE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE DAY YOU ARE GOING TO DIE.
Stephen: SOUNDS FUN. GO ON!
FOR ALL OF US, LIFE COMES WITH A BEST-BEFORE DATE AND ONE DAY WE'LL FIND OURSELVES AT THE END OF THE LINE. THAT'S WHY WE'VE CREATED TIKKER, THE DEATH WATCH THAT COUNTS DOWN YOUR LIFE. JUST SO YOU CAN MAKE EVERY SECOND COUNT.
Stephen: YES, TIKKER, THE WATCH THAT CONSTANTLY REMINDS YOU YOU'RE GONNA DIE. IT'S A GREAT GIFT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY BECAUSE, DON'T FORGET, THEY'RE GONNA DIE, TOO. I'VE GOT TO SAY, I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE OBAMA AT YOUR FUNERAL, BY THE WAY. (LAUGHTER) I GUESS HE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE DEATH PANEL FINISHED THE JOB. (AUDIENCE REACTS) FOLKS, TIKKER ISN'T JUST A WAY TO DIGITALLY PINPOINT THE INEVITABLE MOMENT WHEN YOU ARE DEVOURED BY THE WOLF OF OBLIVION. IT'S ALSO A REMINDER TO HAVE SOME FUN!
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS LEARN HOW TO CHERISH THE TIME AND THE LIFE THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN. TO HONOR IT. SUCK THE MARROW FROM IT. SEIZE THE DAY AND FOLLOW OUR HEARTS! AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO REALIZE THAT SECONDS, DAYS, AND YEARS ARE PASSING NEVER TO COME AGAIN! (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: WHISPERING) NOT YET! FOLKS, I'M SURE YOU'RE ASKING, HOW CAN A WATCH KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO DIE? IT'S NOT AN OLD GYPSY WOMAN WHO LIVES IN THE WOODS. I BROUGHT YOU A LOCK OF HIS HAIR ESMERALDA! WHY ISN'T JIMMY FALLON AGING FASTER? (APPLAUSE) HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. FOLKS, HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. YOU SIMPLY FILL OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH HABITS, RISK FACTORS AND AGE THEN TIKKER WILL GENERATE THE TIME DOWN TO THE SECOND THAT YOU HAVE LEFT. (AUDIENCE REACTS) SO IF YOU'RE 30 WITH A HISTORY OF SERIOUS DRUG ABUSE, YOU MAY ONLY HAVE 40 MORE YEARS TO LIVE. (LAUGHTER) IN FACT, I'M WEARING A TIKKER RIGHT NOW SO I'M ALL SET. TIME TO SEIZE THE DAY BY CELEBRATING MY BIRTHDAY A LITTLE BIT EARLY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LET'S SEE EXACTLY HOW MUCH TIME I'VE GOT LEFT. (GASPS) (LAUGHTER) (GASPS) (LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE REACTS) â™ª AND MANY MORE  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
