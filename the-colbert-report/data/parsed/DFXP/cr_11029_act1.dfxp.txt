TONIGHT I LOOK AT THE PROTESTS IN FERGUSON, THOUGH THEY ARE A LITTLE HARD TO SEE THROUGH THE TEAR GAS. AND THEN ISIS FINDS A NEW WAY TO RECRUIT. THAT'S ONE MORE LINKED IN REQUEST TO DELETE. AND MY GUEST IS ARIZONA SENATOR JOHN McCAIN THOUGH YOU PROBABLY KNOW HIM BEST AS THE MAN WHO LAUNCHED SARAH PALIN'S TV CAREER. RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING A BREATHALYZER THAT DETECTS MARIJUANA. THE BEST PART IS, YOU CAN TURN IT INTO A BONG. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen:  WELCOME-- WELCOME-- WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US. THANK YOU. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU. HEROES IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU. SIT DOWN. NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, FOLKS IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK. IN THE HOME STRETCH. NATION, I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A WONDERFUL, A WONDERFUL-- I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A WONDERFUL THANKSGIVING, OR AS IT IS KNOWN TO NATIVE AMERICANS SARCASTIC YOU'RE WELCOMES GIVING. DINNER AT MY HOUSE WAS GREAT AS ALWAYS. THIS YEAR I GOT THE WISH BONE AND MY WISH CAME TRUE. THE DOCTORS WERE ABLE TO REMOVE IT FROM MY THROAT. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE I WAS OFF ALL LAST WEEK. SO THERE IS A LOT OF NEWS TO CATCH UP ON. STARTING WITH A MAJOR CONFLICT ONCE AGAIN IN A TROUBLED DESERT REGION. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER) WHOOO. (MAKING GUN SOUNDS) DON'T GET COCKY, KID. THE NEW STAR WARS TRAILER DROPPED OVER THANKSGIVING WEEKEND. AND IT WAS ALL ANYONE IN MY FAMILY COULD TALK ABOUT. WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY, LEAD TO MY AUNT RITA SAYING SOME HORRIBLY RACIST THINGS  ABOUT THE GUNGAN. FOLKS, I, I AM THE ORIGINAL FAN OF STAR WARS. IN 1977, THIS IS A TRUE STORY, WHEN I WAS IN 8th GRADE, I WON TWO TICKETS FROM A LOCAL RADIO STATION TO SEE THIS NEW MOVIE STAR WARS TWO WEEKS BEFORE IT CAME OUT NATIONALLY. NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE, HASKEL FEUDENBERG'S MOM DROVE DOES. AND I LOVED IT IT ON THE WAY HOME THERES WITH A FULL MOON. I PRETENDED IT WAS THE DEATHSTAR IT BUT AT SCHOOL ON MONDAY, I COULDN'T EXPLAIN HOW EVERYTHING WAS DIFFERENT NOW BECAUSE NOBODY HAD SEEN IT. THEY THOUGHT MY DARTH VADER IMPRESSION WAS JUST ASTHMA. THOUGH, THOUGH I WILL SAY, I DID GET OUT OF GYM FOR A MONTH. THEN THE MOVIE COMES OUT. EVERYBODY IS SAYING IT IS THE GREATEST THING EVER BUT I SAW IT FIRST, I HAVE BEEN A STAR WARS FAN TWO WEEKS LONGER THAN ANY OF YOU. NOW LET ME TELL YOU--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AND LET ME TELL YOU, FOLKS, THIS TRAILER HAS GOT EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN A STAR WARS MOVIE. WAKE SURFING E-WICK, R2-D2'S HEAD PLAYING SOCCER, EVEN A BLACK STORMTROOPER. SO FOR THE RECORD, JAWAS, IF HE STOPS YOU AND FRISKS YOU, IT'S NOT RACIST. ALSO, YOU ARE KIND OF ASKING FOR IT IT THOSE HOODIES. AND FOLKS, THAT'S NOT-- NO, NO, IT IS NOT THE JAWAS FAULT. THAT IS NOT EVEN THE BEST PART, FOLKS. CHECK OUT THIS AWESOME LIGHTSABER. IT'S A LIGHTSABER WITH TWO MINI LIGHTSABERS ON IT. IT'S A MENAGE-A-SABRE. SADLY, SADLY I THINK I HAVE A WOOKIEE IN THE AUDIENCE. SADLY, THERE ARE SOME STUCK UP HALF WITTED SCRUFFY LOOKING NERF HERDERS OUT THERE WHO AREN'T THRILLED WITH THE NEW JEDI WEAPON. THEY SAY IF THESE THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOUR HANDS LIKE SWORD HILTS IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME YOU CROSS LIGHTSABERS AND IT SLID DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BLADE YOUR OPPONENT'S LIGHTSABER  WOULD CHOP THROUGH THE SIDE SABRES AND TAKE OFF YOUR HAND. OR AS IT WAS STATED ON TWITTER, "HILT ON LIGHT SABER STUPID AND IMPRACTICAL CHILDHOOD RUINED, EVERYTHING RUINED." YEAH. (APPLAUSE) RUINED. WELL, I SAY IT'S THE PERFECT DESIGN, HERE IS HOW IT WORKS. I HAVE DONE MY ANALYSIS, OKAY. PEOPLE THINK, PEOPLE THINK IT'S ACTUALLY THREE DIFFERENT PLASMA STREAMS BUT IT'S ALL ONE. THE LONG BEAM, THE LONG BEAM RIGHT HERE, OKAY, IT COMES OUT AND THE TWO SMALLER BEAMS AT THE BOTTOM, OKAY, THEY'RE STILL ATTACHED TO IT IT THEY DON'T START WHERE THE LITTLE METAL HILT ENDS, OKAY. THEY'RE ATTACHED TO THE OTHER BEAM INSIDE. THE METAL HILTS ARE JUST CASINGS AROUND THE LITTLE BEAM TO PROTECT YOUR HAND. EVEN IF SOMEONE SLICES THROUGH THE METAL THEY'RE GOING TO HIT THE BEAM RIGHT THERE. ANY PADAWAN KNOWS THAT. NOW I KNOW-- THAT IS SCIENCE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. YOU'RE SAYING BUT STEPHEN, IN THE TRAILER THE FIRST LIGHT BEAM COMES OUT BEFORE THE OTHER TWO. HOW COULD IT ALL BE ONE BEAM. WELL, GREG, IT'S SIMPLE. YOU JUST NEED THREE FOCUSING CRYSTAL ACTIVATORS TO SPLIT THE PLASMA INTO PERPENDICULAR BLADE ENERGY CHANNELS. CONFUSED? WELL, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND IN TWO WEEKS WHEN YOU CATCH UP WITH WHERE I'M AT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I HAVE HAD IT. AMATEUR HOUR IS OVER. THE PROS ARE TAKING IT OVER ON THIS ONE. OF COURSE, FOLKS, THE BIG STORY OVER THANKSGIVING WAS THE ONGOING RACIAL TENSIONS IN AMERICA. WE JUST GAVE YOU THE JACKIE ROBINSON STORMTROOPER. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT? AND IT WAS ALL OVER ONE TINY DECISION.
A GRAND JURY DECIDED NOT TO INDICT OFFICER DARREN WILSON IN THE SHOOTING DEATH OF MICHAEL BROWN.
HUNDREDS SWARMED THE FEDERAL COURTHOUSE BEFORE FANNING OUT THROUGH THE CITY STREETS.
THE COURTHOUSE IS BARRICADED. THE SIDEWALK BLOCKED. PROTESTS OVERNIGHT MOVED FROM FERGUSON TO ST. LOUIS.
YES, FERGUSON HAS ERUPTED BECAUSE OFFICER DARREN WILSON WILL NOT FACE TRIAL. FOR SOME REASON, THESE PROTESTORS WON'T TAKE "ITS LEGAL TO SHOOT AN UNARMED BLACK MAN" FOR AN ANSWER. FOLKS, THESE DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE BEEN A SOBERING REMINDER THAT ST. LOUIS EXISTS I THOUGHT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE AGES AGO THROUGH THAT STAR GATE THEY BUILT. NOW-- NOW, NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME, GUYS. VERY NICE.
AND IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT THEY DESTROYED IT FERGUSON. THESE PROTESTS HAVE SPREAD TO WHAT AMERICANS HOLD MOST SACRED, FOOTBALL.
THE EVENTS IN FERGUSON HAVE CROSSED OVER INTO THE WORLD OF SPORTS.
FIVE PLAYERS OF THE ST. LOUIS RAMS PUT THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR HEADS IN A DON'T SHOOT POSE RIGHT BEFORE THEIR GAME AGAINST THE OAKLAND RAIDERS.
WELL THAT IS JUST WRONG. WHY WOULD ANYONE SURRENDER TO THE RAIDERS? THANKFULLY, WHEN THE ST. LOUIS POLICE, SEE YOUNG BLACK MEN WITH THEIR HANDS IN THE AIR, THEY COME OUT FIRING.
THE ST. LOUIS POLICE OFFICER ASSOCIATION IS CONDEMNING THE PLAYER'S ACTIONS CALLING THE MOVE TASTELESS, OFFENSIVE AND INFLAMMATORY.
YES IT IS TASTELESS AND OFFENSIVE TO SEE THIS AT THAT TIME AN NFL GAME. WHICH REMINDS ME, WELCOME BACK, RAY RICE, WE'VE MISSED YOU. AND THE YOU HAVE TO STOP THAT OFFENSIVE GESTURE BEFORE IT SPREADS. DURING THE GAME I SAW REFEREES DO IT A BUNCH OF TIMES. THEY BUILT GIANT STEEL MONUMENTS TO IT AT EACH END OF THE FIELD. LATER THE CROWD EVEN PASSED IT AROUND THE STADIUM IN SOME KIND OF CELEBRATION. THE POINT IS, THESE PLAYERS SHOULD BE PUNISHED. I SAY WE MAKE THEM PLAY FOOTBALL USING ONLY THEIR FEET WITH SOME KIND OF PENALTY FOR TOUCHING IT WITH THEIR HANDS. YOU KNOW WHAT? THINGS WOULD BE A LOT CALMER IF BLACK PEOPLE JUST AGREED NEVER TO PUT THEIR HANDS UP. OR IN THEIR POCKETS AS SEEN IN THIS ENCOUNTER WITH THE POLICE OFFICER BEING FILMED BY A BLACK MAN WHO ASKED WHY HE WAS BEING STOPPED.
YOU'RE MAKING PEOPLE NERVOUS.
BY WALKING BY?
YEAH, THEY SAID YOU HAD YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS.
WOW, WALKING BY WITH YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS MAKES PEOPLE NERVOUS TO CALL THE POLICE WHEN IT'S SNOWING OUTSIDE?
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO TODAY?
WALKING, WITH MY HANDS IN MY POCKETS.
YOU CAN'T-- YOU CAN'T TRUST SOMEONE WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR POCKETS. POCKETS ARE THE HOLSTER OF THE FIST. THE POINT IS, THERE ARE JUST SOME GESTURES THAT BLACK PEOPLE SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT RIGHT NOW.
OKAY. HANDS UP, TOO INFLAMMATORY. HANDS IN POCKETS, TOO THREATENING. THIS TRICK, LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE STEALING THE THUMB  OKAY. ALSO, AVOID-- JAZZ HANDS! OKAY. BECAUSE JAZZ HANDS LEAD TO HEROIN HANDS, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. AND NO, I'M A LITTLE TEAPOT, OKAY. YOU'RE JUST ASKING FOR A COP TO YELL HE'S GOT A SPOUT, START FIRING. AND THE MOST THREATENING THING A BLACK PERSON CAN DO IS HERE'S THE CHURCH, HERE'S THE STEEPLE, BECAUSE WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOORS LOOK AT ALL THE BLACK PEOPLE, THAT COULD BE A RIOT YOU'RE GOING TO GET TEAR GASSED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
