HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. LADIES AN GENTLEMEN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCH TELEVISION. THEY GOT SOME GOOD STUFF ON THERE. YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT. THIS WEEKEND THE TUBE WAS LOADED WITH PEOPLE REHASHING THE RACIST COMMENTS OF L.A. CLIPPERS OWNER AND MAN WHO EATS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE BLACK AND WHITE COOKIE DONALD STERLING. NOW AS I SAID LAST WEEK, STERLING'S COMMENTS ARE REPREHENSIBLE. NO ONE CONDEMNS THEM MORE THAN I DO. AND YES, IT IS A CONTEST. (LAUGHTER) BUT THE MAN WAS FINED $2.5 MILLION AND SUSPENDED FOR LIFE. THE STORY IS OVER. LET'S MOVE ALONG. BECAUSE I BELIEVE RACISM GOES AWAY NATURALLY IF YOU STOP TALKING ABOUT IT. (LAUGHTER) JUST LIKE STDs. SO I WAS ESPECIALLY HURT THIS PAST SUNDAY TO SEE THE TALLEST FRIEND OF THIS SHOW KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR ON THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS GOING AFTER WHITEY.
WHAT ABOUT THE UNDERLYING ISSUE THAT THE COUNTRY IS STILL STRUGGLING WITH LINGERING RACISM.
WELL, THIS IS A PROBLEM. I DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH. MORE WHITES BELIEVE IN GHOSTS THAN BELIEVE IN RACISM. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OH YEAH, KAREEM? TWO WORDS. ERNIE HUDSON. (APPLAUSE) DID THIS MAN-- DID THIS GOOD MAN, DID HE GIVE HIS LIFE FOR NOTHING? (LAUGHTER) ERNIE HUDSON'S DEAD, RIGHT? NO, I'M BEING TOLD HE IS ALIVE. ARE YOU HAPPY, KAREEM? I CAN'T BELIEVE ERNIE HUDSON IS ALIVE TO HEAR THESE KIND OF ATTACKS. OH, ALL WHITE PEOPLE BELIEVE IN GHOSTS AND DON'T BELIEVE IN RACISM. (LAUGHTER) EVEN IF-- EVEN IF THAT IS TRUE, EVEN IF THAT IS TRUE LET'S LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE HERE. GHOSTS GIVE WHITE PEOPLE SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID OF. IF I WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND HEAR THINGS RATTLING AROUND DOWNSTAIRS, I GOT TWO OPTIONS, EITHER IT'S A GHOST OR IT'S A BLACK GUY, OKAY. YOU PICK, KAREEM, I'M GOING WITH GHOST. BUT THEN AGAIN I'M NOT A RACIST LIKE SOME PEOPLE. I MEAN COME ON, KAREEM! WE BOTH KNOW IF YOU SAW A SHRIEKING SPECTRAL FIGURE GLIDING TOWARDS YOU ON A SIDEWALK YOU'D CROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. (LAUGHTER) OR IF THE APPARITION OF A VICTORIAN CHILD MOVES INTO YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE AND WOULDN'T STOP POINTING AT A BLEEDING CLOSET DOOR, I THINK YOU WOULD WORRY ABOUT YOUR PROPERTY VALUE DROPPING. (LAUGHTER) BUT I'M GOING TO LET YOU GET BY ON THIS ONE. I WILL LET YOU SLIDE. BECAUSE YOU'RE A FRIEND. AN IN THIS CASE, IT'S REASONABLE TO MIX UP RACISM AND GHOSTS. BECAUSE DONALD STERLING IS BOTH A RACIST AND LOOKS LIKE SLIMER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
