[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. NOW BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL BREAK,  I TOLD YOU THAT THE SUPREME  COURT HAD STRUCK DOWN THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT AND THEN  GUTTED THE 1965 VOTING RIGHTS  ACT. WHO KNOWS WHAT THIS MEANS? HERE TO TELL ME WHAT THIS MEANS,  PLEASE WELCOME SLATE'S LEGAL  EXPERT AND SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AT YALE LAW SCHOOL, EMILY  BAZELON. EMILY, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. EMILY, WITH DOMA STRUCK DOWN,  SHOCKER. WHAT HAPPENED? EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE WHAT  PROP-8 IS. THAT WAS A CALIFORNIA LAW DOING  WHAT?
IT WAS BANNING GAY MARRIAGE  IN CALIFORNIA. IT WAS PASSED BY THE VOTERS BUT  HAS BEEN STRUCK DOWN AS  UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY A TRIAL COURT JUDGE. THEN THAT RULING HAD BEEN UPHELD  BY THE APPEALS COURT. THAT WAS THE CASE THAT CAME  BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT.
WHAT WAS THEIR DECISION IN  PROP-8?
THE SUPREME COURT SAID WE  DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN  FRONT OF US TO DECIDE THIS CASE. THE PARTY, THE DEFENDERS OF  PROPOSITION DON'T HAVE STANDING. WE CAN'T DECIDE THIS CASE. THAT MEANS THAT THE TRIAL  COURT'S RULING STRIKING DOWN  PROP-8
Stephen: EVERYBODY HAS  STANDING IN PROP-8 BECAUSE  EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW, COULD GET  MARRIED. YOU KNOW, AND I'M MARRIED. WHY COULDN'T I DEFEND PROP-8  BECAUSE NOW DOMA IS DEAD, MY  MARRIAGE, I THINK, IS IN  INVALIDATED.
NO. Stephen: I THINK YOU'RE A  LESBIAN NOW. YOU'RE GOING TO BE A GREAT ONE,  BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU. YOUR MARRIAGE, NOTHING HAS  CHANGED
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING  ABOUT? THERE IS NO SANTITY TO ANYONE'S  MARRIAGE NOW BECAUSE NOW ANY  TOM, DICK OR HARRY CAN GET MARRIED IF ONLY TWO OF THEM DO.
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH  THE LEGAL STATUS OF YOUR  MARRIAGE. THIS IS ABOUT EXPANDING THE  DEFINITION TO INCLUDE MORE  PEOPLE NOT CONTRACTING IT FOR YOU
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT,  THERE IS A MESS HERE THOUGH. SCALIA CALLED THIS WHOLE  ARGUMENT ARGLE-BARGLE. IS THAT LATIN? AS SCALIA POINTS OUT NOW THAT IF  YOU GET MARRIED IN NEW YORK,  LEGALLY MARRIED IN NEW YORK BUT IF I GO TO ALABAMA I'M NOT  MARRIED THERE, RIGHT?
FOR PURPOSES OF FEDERAL  BENEFITS THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE. THERE IS THIS REALLY INTERESTING  SET OF LEGAL QUESTIONS, AND THE  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. DO THEY EXTEND FEDERAL BEEN  ANIES TO YOU WHEN YOU GET  MARRIED IN NEW YORK? ONLY WHILE YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK  OR DO YOU HANG ON TO THEM WHEN  YOU MOVE TO ALABAMA? THAT'S THE NEXT CHAPTER THAT  WILL ALL BE PLAYING OUT.
ANYWAY WE'RE GOING TO GET THE  GAY TOOTHPASTE BACK IN THE TUBE?
THE GENIE IS OUT OF THE  BOTTLE BECAUSE IT SEEMS HIGHLY  UNLIKELY THAT THE SUPREME COURT WOULD SAY TO THE STATES THAT  HAVE GAY MARRIAGE, THAT'S A  PROBLEM. THAT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THEY ARE CLEARLY MOVING IN THE  OTHER DIRECTION.
Stephen: I THINK IN THE DOMA  CASE THAT KENNEDY WROTE, WRITE? HE'S AN IDIOT. OKAY. BUT HE AGREED IN THE VOTING  RIGHTS CASE. HOW COME HE'S SO SMART  SOMETIMES?
WELL, ONE COMMON THREAD OF  THESE CASES WHICH YOU TALKED  ABOUT EARLIER IS STATES' RIGHTS. AND THE GENIUS OF THE GAY  MARRIAGE CASE OF THE CHALLENGE  TO DOMA WAS THE WAY IN WHICH IT BOTH ASSERTED THE PRIMACY OF  STATES AND HELPED OUT GAY  PEOPLE. KENNEDY WENT FOR BOTH OF THOSE  THINGS.
Stephen: SCALIA AND GINSBURG  BOTH HAD SCATHING DISSENTS ON  EITHER SIDE. SCALIA AND GINSBURG. DO THOSE SCATHING DISSENTS DO  THEY MEAN ANYTHING OR IS IT JUST  SORT OF AN ELEVATED VERSION OF AN OLD PERSON WRITING AN ANGRY  LETTER TO THE EDITOR?
THEY CAN MEAN SOMETHING IN  MORAL TERMS, RIGHT? LIKE WE CAN LOOK BACK ON A  DISSENT LIKE THE ONE IN PLESSY  VERSUS FERGUSON. THAT'S THE OLD CASE THAT SAID IT  WAS OKAY TO HAVE SEPARATE BUT  EQUAL. WE THINK ABOUT THAT DISSENT AS  CORRECT. SO IT ENDS UP HAVING KIND OF  MORAL WEIGHT BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE  ANY LEGAL VALUE. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT
Stephen: IS THERE ANY WAY WE  COULD TURN THE GAY PEOPLE AND  THE BLACK PEOPLE AGAINST EACH  OTHER? AND MAKE THEM FIGHT IN A SORT OF  THUNDER DOME. AND THE WINNER GETS THE CIVIL  RIGHTS?
I DON'T THINK SO. YOU KNOW, ONE THING ABOUT THIS  COUNTRY...
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT SURE. IT'S POSSIBLE.
NO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NO. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE. AND THE REASON IS THESE ARE  SEPARATE MATTERS OF CIVIL  RIGHTS. THEY GET... THE SUPREME COURT  DECIDES EACH CASE AS IT COMES  BEFORE IT. THERE ISN'T THIS KIND OF  OVERARCHING WORLD IN WHICH THE  LITIGANTS MEET IN SOME KIND OF MATCH-UP
Stephen: AFTER THESE TWO  DECISIONS I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE  SAID THAT THE GAY RIGHTS IS THE NEW CIVIL RIGHTS. FIGHT OF OUR TIME. ARE GAY PEOPLE THE NEW BLACK  PEOPLE? IF SO, CAN BLACK PEOPLE GET  MARRIEDED NOW? OH, CAN WE TAKE THE VOTE AWAY  FROM GAY PEOPLE?
BLACK PEOPLE CAN DEFINITELY  GET MARRIED JUST LIKE EVERYBODY  ELSE.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW. NO TAKING AWAY VOTES FROM  ANYONE. WE DON'T DO THAT
Stephen: WE'LL SEE WHAT  HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE. EMILY BAZELON FROM SLATE. THANK YOU, EMILY. WE'LL BE RIGHT
