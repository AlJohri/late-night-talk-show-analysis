STEPHEN: THAT'S SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME BACK. THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES MAY BE  OVER, BUT I STILL NEED MY FIX. SO I WAS GLUED TO LAST NIGHT'S  INDIANA SENATE DEBATE BETWEEN  PRO-LIFE DEMOCRAT JOE DONNELLY  AND EVEN PRO-ER LIFER REPUBLICAN RICHARD MOOOOUUUUURDOCK. [LIGHTNING] SORRY, NOT SURE WHY, BUT THAT  HAPPENS SOMETIMES WHEN I SAY  MOOOOUUUURDOCK. [LIGHTNING] [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW IN THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT,  ONE MOMENT KINDA STUCK OUT. HERE'S MOURDOCK WHEN QUESTIONED  ON ABORTION.
I STRUGGLED WITH MYSELF FOR A  LONG TIME BUT I CAME TO REALIZE  LIFE IS THAT GIFT FROM GOD, EVEN WHEN LIFE BEGINS IN THAT  HORRIBLE SITUATION OF RAPE, IT  IS SOMETHING THAT GOD INTENDED  TO HAPPEN. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
STEPHEN: OKAY, LET ME JUST  UPDATE THE "DAYS WITHOUT A GOP  RAPE MENTION" BOARD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER ] NOW MOURDOCK'S COMMENTS UPSET  MANY HOOSIERS AND ALSO POSSIBLY  GOD. IT REALLY MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A  TERRIBLE GIFT GIVER. I WILL SAY, GOD, NEXT TIME  YOU'RE STUMPED WITH PICKING OUT  A GOOD GIFT FOR THE LADIES, JUST  GO WITH AN EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND MOURDOCK IS NOT THE FIRST  MEMBER OF THE GOP TO DROP THE R  WORD. FIRST, WE HAD MISSOURI SENATE  CANDIDATE TODD AKIN WHO SAID  "LEGITIMATE" RAPE VICTIMS  COULDN'T GET PREGNANT BECAUSE THE FEMALE BODY HAS WAYS OF  SHUTTING THAT WHOLE THING DOWN. THEN THERE WAS IOWA  REPRESENTATIVE AND ANGRY DINNER  ROLL STEVE KING WHO SAID HE'S  NEVER HEARD OF A GIRL GETTING PREGNANT FROM STATUTORY RAPE. PENNSYLVANIA SENATE CANDIDATE  TOM SMITH EQUATED RAPE WITH OUT  OF WEDLOCK PREGNANCY. AND WISCONSIN STATE  REPRESENTATIVE ROGER RIVARD WHO  OFFERED THE SAGE ADVICE THAT  SOME GIRLS, THEY RAPE SO EASY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT CAN YOU SAY? SOME POLITICAL CAREERS, THEY END  SO QUICKLY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] AND NOW THERE'S MOURDOCK. TOGETHER I LIKE TO CALL THESE  GUYS "TEAM RAPE" WHICH THEY  PROBABLY WOULDN'T APPRECIATE,  BUT COME ON -- THEY'RE KIND OF ASKING FOR IT. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW WE'VE GOT AN IMPORTANT  ELECTION COMING UP, SO I JUST  WANT TO ADDRESS MY FELLOW  CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE RUNNING FOR OFFICE. FELLAS, YOU  MAY NOT BE AWARE OF  THIS, BUT IN 1920 WOMEN GOT THE  RIGHT TO VOTE, AND SINCE THEN,  AMONG LIKELY VOTERS RAPE'S APPROVAL RATING HAS PLUMMETED. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE  VICE ON HOW TO HANDLE YOURSELF  IF THE MIDDLE OF THE DEBATE  DEBATE OR WHILE CASUALLY TALKING TO REPORTERS, YOU FEEL YOURSELF  ABOUT TO SHARE YOUR VIEWS ON  RAPE, I WANT YOU-- AND THIS IS  IMPORTANT, SO GO GRAB A PENCIL-- IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO TALK  ABOUT RAPE, I WANT YOU TO STAB  YOURSELF IN THE EYE WITH YOUR  PENCIL. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY? REALLY JAM IT IN THERE. WORK IT AROUND BACK AND FORTH UP  IN YOUR SKULL CAVITY, OKAY? SEE IF YOU CAN SEVER THE PORTION  OF YOUR BRAIN THAT STORES THE  WORD RAPE. AND DON'T STOP UNTIL YOUR URGE  TO APPEAL TO VOTERS BY TALKING  ABOUT RAPE HAS PASSED. SADLY, IT'S TOO LATE FOR RICHARD  MOURDOCK. THESE COMMENTS HAVE LEFT HIS  CAMPAIGN IN SHAMBLES. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? DON'T SHED A TEAR, FOLKS. I'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT THIS  IS SOMETHING THAT GOD INTENDED  TO HAPPEN. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
