WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,  NOW FOLKS THANK YOU VERY  MUCH BEFORE THE BREAK MADAME TUSSAUDS OFFERED ME A SPOT  IN THEIR FAMOUS WAX MUSEUM  AND THEN MEASURED ME FOR  IMPROPER TALLITY. BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS  COULD MY SMOLDERING GOOD  LOOKS AND BLISTERING  SIGNIFICANCE BE CAPTURED IN A MEDIUM WITH SUCH A LOW  MELTING POINT? LET'S FIND OUT IN PART TWO  OF --
STEPHEN COLBERT WAX ON  AND WAX OFF AT MADAME  TUSSAUDS.
I HAD MADE IT TO THE HALL  OF PRESIDENTS.
THIS IS GEORGE  WASHINGTON.
NO, HE HAD WOODEN TEETH.
FAMOUSLY.
HE DID.
DOES THIS WAX FIGURINE  HAVE WOODEN TEETH.
IT DOES TO THE.
SWING AND A MISS, SWING  AND A MISS ON THAT ONE. LARRY FEINS FROM THE THREE  STOOGES.
JOHN ADAMS, OUR SECOND  PRESIDENT.
OKAY. THE FUN INTERACTIVE SET, YOU  SIT NEXT TO HIM IN A CHAIR.
INCREDIBLE. WHAT OTHER TECHNOLOGY DO YOU  HAVE.
OUR 8th PRESIDENT.
OUR FIRST PRESIDENT WITH  IRONIC FAITION HAIR.
THIS IS WORTH THE PRICE  OF ADMISSION RIGHT HERE JUST  TO PET HIS FACE.
WHO IS THIS.
MARTIN VAN BURREN.
AND THIS MAN, I DID NOT  REALIZE WE ELECTED VAMPIRE  TO THE SENATE.
WE DIDN'T. THIS IS WILLIAM HENRY  HARRISON. JOHN TYLER, 10th PRESIDENT  HAD THE MOST CHILDREN, WOULD  YOU LIKE TO GUESS HOW MANY.
425.
14.
14. ALL RIGHT. WHO IS THIS?
OUR 18th PRESIDENT YOU  LISSES S GRANT.
WHAT DOES THE S STAND  FOR.
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
THANK YOU.
THIS DOESN'T SEEM FAIR. WHY DOES FDR GET TO SIT  DOWN.
I CAN LICK HIM.
YOU CANNOT.
WE'RE WEARING ALMOST THE  COMPAQ SAME SUIT AND TIE T  WOULD BE LIKE LICKING  MYSELF.
SOMETHING I'VE ALSO  DREAMED OF DOING.
THAT I DON'T MIND BUT NOT  RONALD REAGAN.
I DON'T MIND IT EITHER  BUT ALL THE HOT-- ISN'T  BRINGING THAT AROUND. ALL RIGHT. I'M FROM THE FUTURE. GOT TO GET OUT.
CAN I LICK HIM.
NO, PLEASE DON'T.
WHY, YOU SEEM PRETTY UP  SET JUST NOW. BEFORE YOU SAID NO, NOW YOU  SEEM UP SET.
I'M GETTING UP SET.
YOU'RE GETTING UP SET. WHY, WHY IS THIS ONE SO  SPECIAL, WHY DOES IT UP SET  YOU TO ASK IF I CAN LICK  LINCOLN.
YOU CAN'T LICK ANY OF OUR  WAX FIGURES.
BUT THIS IS THE ONE THAT  SOMEHOW BROKE THE CAMEL'S  BACK FOR YOU. SOMETHING HAPPENED.
ONE OF OUR MOST POPULAR  PRESIDENT.
YEAH, I WOULD SAY OUR  MOST POPULAR PRESIDENT.
AGREED.
I SEEM TO HAVE A LITTLE  MORE REFERENCE FOR THESE  PRESIDENTS THAN YOU DO. LINCOLN I THINK IF ANYBODY  SHOULD BE ABLE TO LICK HIM  IT SHOULD BE I. YOU UNDERSTAND. I APOLOGIZE. APOLOGIZE FOR HIM.
OKAY. SO HERE WE HAVE TIGER WOODS.
THIS IS HARRIET TUBMAN.
SO TECHNICALLY IT'S NOT A  HALL OF PRESIDENTS. JULIETTE GORDON LOWE,  FOUNDER OF THE GIRL  SECURITIES.
AND WHEN WAS HE  PRESIDENT.
SHE WAS NOT PRESIDENT.
AGAIN, NOT HALL OF  PRESIDENTS.
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS IT,  TIGER WOODS  (APPLAUSE)
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR  IT. FINALLY WE WERE READY FOR MY  UNVEILING AND THE WHOLE  WORLD WAS WATCHING.
I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE  AT MADAME TUSSAUDS FOR THE  HONOR OF BECOMING THE LATEST WAXICAN AMERICAN BECAUSE  BECOME CAST IN WAX IS TRUE  IMMORTALITY AS LONG AS THE  EARTH IS NOT IN ANY WAY GETTING WARMER. AT LEAST IT WAS TIME TO GIVE  THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANTED. ANOTHER ME. BUT HAD MADAME TUSSAUDS  CAPTURED MY WAXY ESSENCE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ONE,  TWO, ME! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THEY DID IT. THEY MADE MY DREAM A  REALITY. AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING  LEFT TO DO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I AM DELICIOUS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
