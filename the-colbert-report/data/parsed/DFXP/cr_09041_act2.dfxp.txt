[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THANKS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU SOX. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THE WAY TO A  MAN'S HEART IS THROUGH HIS  STOMACH. SO NEVER LET THEY OPERATE YOU  ON. THIS IS THOUGHT FOR FOOD. FOLKS, THERE'S NO QUESTION THIS  COUNTRY HAS A DRUG PROBLEM, WHAT  WITH COKE, ECSTASY, AND BATH SALTS OUT THERE, MANY PARENTS  SMOKE MEDICAL MARIJUANA JUST FOR  THEIR ANXIETY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NOW THERE'S A NEW SUBSTANCE  WE'RE ALL HOOKED ON.
DR. WILLIAM DAVIS SAYS A LOAF  OF BREAD IS JUST AS ADDICTIVE AS  CRACK. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S ADDICTIVE. PLAIN AND SIMPLE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT: BREAD. DOUGH. SATAN'S LOAF. THE CRUSTY CRANK. DROPPING SOME PUMPERNICKEL,  CHASING THE MULTIGRAIN DRAGON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS --  AND JUST WHAT MAKES THE YEAST  BEAST SO ADDICTIVE?
THERE'S SOMETHING IN MODERN  WHEAT CALLED GLIADIN, THAT WAS  CHANGED BY THE EFFORTS OF GENETICISTS TO CHANGE THE  PROPERTIES OF THIS PLANT, MOSTLY  TO INCREASE YIELD. AND THE UNINTENDED EFFECT IS  THAT IT INCREASES APPETITE. YOU  CAN'T HELP YOURSELF. YOU HAVE ONE BAGEL YOU WANT  MORE.
Stephen: TODAY'S WHEAT IS THE  PRIMO. (bleep). IT'S NOT LIKE THE (bleep)  TOAST YOUR UNCLE BUTTERED  AT WOODSTOCK. AND FOLKS, THIS IS PERSONAL FOR  ME. BECAUSE I USED TO RIDE THE  WHITE-BREAD PONY. I THOUGHT I COULD HANDLE IT. JUST SOME CRACKERS WITH MY  CHEESE A BAGUETTE AMONG FRIENDS,  MAYBE A CROISSANT TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF. BEFORE I KNEW IT, I WAS WAKING  AND BAKING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NOW I'M A PARENT, AND LIKE  THE FOLKS AT CBS NEWS, I WANT TO  LOOK OUT FOR THE CHILDREN. SO TONIGHT, I'M PROUD TO LAUNCH  A NEW CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE THE  KIDS ON THE DANGERS OF WHEAT. MOVE OVER McGRUFF THE CRIME DOG! IT'S TIME FOR "McGNAW THE  GLUTEN-FREE BEAVER." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HI, McGNAW!
HEY, STEPHEN! HEY, KIDS! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: McGNAW, I UNDERSTAND  YOU'VE GOT AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE  FOR TODAY'S YOUTH.
YEAH! KIDS, STAY AWAY FROM WHEAT IF  YOU WANT TO GROW UP BIG AND  STRONG LIKE YOUR OLD PAL,  McGNAW! YOM YOM YOM!
Stephen: NOW WHAT IF SOMEONE  TRIES TO OFFER THEM WHEAT,  McGNAW?
WELL, JUST SAY "GNAW"! THEN  TELL SOMEONE YOU TRUST, LIKE A  PARENT, OR A TEACHER -- OR A  BEAVER! [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: GREAT ADVICE. SO WHAT "SHOULD" KIDS EAT?
WELL, INSTEAD OF WHEAT, YOU  CAN EAT HEALTHY THINGS LIKE  FRUITS OR VEGETABLES OR WOOD! [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, KIDS. WAIT, WHAT WAS THAT LAST ONE?
WOOD! YOM YOM YOM! [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: OKAY, UM, McGNAW,  I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE EATING  WOOD IS GOOD IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, STEPHEN-- IT'S A GREAT  IDEA! LEAF IT TO BEAVER-- IT'S  INCREDI-BARK-ABLE! LAUGH -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: IT'S A GREAT IN  THEO. YOUR CORE MESSAGE STILL SOLID  BUT HUMANS CAN'T DIGEST WOOD.
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED IT?
Stephen: NO, I HAVEN'T.
THEN HOW "WOOD" YOU KNOW? WOOD! WOOD!
Stephen: OKAY, KIDS, DON'T  EAT WOOD. IT'S DANGEROUS AND DUMB ADVICE.
HEY, STEPHEN, I'VE GOT  SOMETHING YOU CAN EAT-- ME! HUH? [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I GOT YOUR WOOD RIGHT HERE,  STEPHEN.
Stephen: OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH. THAT'S ENOUGH! KIDS, DO NOT EAT WHEAT, ALSO DO  NOT EAT WOOD.
WAIT A MINUTE, KIDS WHO ARE  YOU GOING TO BELIEVE, HU SNRKS  THIS OLD MAN OR McGNAW THE GLUTEN FREE BEAVER. EAT WOOD! [CROWD CHANGT EAT WOOD]
Stephen: SHUT UP! DON'T LISTEN TO HIM! STOP IT  HE'S NOT A REAL BEAVER. HE'S JUST SOME STUPID ACTOR IN A  BEAVER COSTUME. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
GREAT. GREAT. NICE IMPROV, JAGOFF. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU JUST DESTROYED THIS ILLUSION  FOR A WHOLE GENERATION OF  CHILDREN WHO HAVE COME TO LOVE AND TRUST McGNAW.
Stephen: YOU WERE TELLING  THEM TO EAT WOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT'S A CHOKING  HAZARD?
HOW SHOULD I KNOW? I DON'T HAVE KIDS. I HAD A VASECTOMY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT, GET  OUT AND LEAVE THE BEAVER HEAD  BACKSTAGE. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
LOOK, MAN. I'M REALLY SORRY. I'M JUST ON EDGE BECAUSE I  HAVEN'T HAD ANY WHEAT TODAY. [ LAUGHTER ] STOONCHTS OKAY, LOOK HERE SAY  BAG OF HOT DOG BUNS. DO YOU --
YEAH! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I GOTTA CALL MY SPONSOR.
Stephen: DON'T EAT WHEAT,  KIDS! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
