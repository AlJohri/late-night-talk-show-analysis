Stephen:  TONIGHT, WE'VE  GOT A BIG PROBLEM WITH GITMO IN  THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GITMO  IN. ( LAUGHTER )  THEN THE SUMMER BLOC BUSTERS. NOW HOLLYWOOD CAN UNDERMINE OUR  MORALS IN 3D. AND MY GUEST BEN KINGSLEY IS AN  ACCOMPLISHED ACTOR DESPITE BEING  BORN WITH A DEBILITATING ACCENT. A MAN ARRESTED FOR SHOOTING AT  THE WHITE HOUSE SAID HE WAS  UPSET OVER U.S. MARIJUANA LAWS. MAN, IF ONLY THERE WERE SOME WAY  TO MELLOW THAT GUY OUT. ( LAUGHTER )  THIS IS THE THE "COLBERT REPORT"   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE  REPORT! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  FOLKS, PLEASE,  FOLKS, PLEASE, WE'VE GOT TO-- I  LOVE IT. YOU LOVE IT. BUT I HAVE GOT TO GET TO THE  BREAKING NEWS FROM 24 HOURS AGO. ( LAUGHTER )  FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE  ARRESTED THREE ACCOMPLICED OF  ALLEGED BOSTON BOMBER JOKE-A-HAR  TSARNAEV. THE ACCOMPLICES ARE TWO  KAZAKHSTANIS. DIAS KA-HAD... KATY PERRY  AND AZA... HAZMAT TAZMANIAN  KAYAK. ( LAUGHTER )  DAMN YOU TERRORISTS! WITH YOUR WEAPONNIZED  CONSONANTS. WHY CAN'T YOU AREV REGULAR NAMES  LIKE RICK, OR ALAN OR AYMAN  AL-ZAWAHIRI. FOLKS, THESE TWO, AND AN  AMERICANED NAMED ROBEL  PHILLIPOS, ARE FRIENDS OF  DZHOKAR TSARNAEV, WHO TEXTED HIM AFTER THE F.B.I. RELEASED THE  PHOTOS OF THE BOMBERS.
INVESTIGATORS SAY ONE OF THE  ROOM MATES TEXTED DZHOKAR SAYING  HE LOOKS LIKE THE SUSPECT ON  TELEVISION. DZHOKAR ALLEGEDLY RESPONDS,  L.O.L.
Stephen:  WHICH, I BELIEVE  PROVED HE'S A RADICAL ISLAMIST. BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW L.O.L. IS  SHORT FOR LULULULULULU. ( APPLAUSE )    .   ( CHEERS )   NOW AFTER THAT THE THREE  SUSPECTS AWARE THAT THE FEDS  WERE SEEKING THEIR FRIEND FOR BOMBING THE MARATHON, RACED TO  HIS APARTMENT AND URGENTLY  DECIDED TO WATCH A MOVIE. ( LAUGHTER )  ALTHOUGH, DURING INTERROGATION  THEY DID NOT SPECIFY WHICH ONE. BUT IF IT WAS JOHN CARTER, THEY  CAN BE ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION  OF A BOMB. THEN-- TRUE. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. IT'S A FEDERAL OFFENSE. THEN THEY DID SOMETHING THAT  THEY MIGHT LATER REGRET. SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT IT.
POLICE SAY KADYRBAYEV DECIDED  TO REMOVE THE BACKPACK FROM THE  ROOM IN ORDER TO HELP HIS  FRIEND.
THE BACKPACK WITH FIREWORKS  THAT HAD BEEN EMPTIED OF THEIR  POWDER AND A JAR OF VASELINE.
Stephen:  THEY HAD TO DITCH  THE BACKPACK BECAUSE THE  FIREWORKS WERE INCRIMINATING, AND THE JAR OF VASELINE IS JUST  EMBARRASSING. ( LAUGHTER )  IN FACT, I WANT TO CHANGE MY  GUESS AS TO WHAT THE MOVIE WAS  THEY WERE WATCHING. I'M GOING TO GO WITH "OSAMA BIN  LAYIN' 3: JI-HARD-ON."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SO, SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO  WITH THESE IDIOTS? THE ANSWER USED TO BE EASY-- I  HAVE NO IDEA, SO LET'S SHIP THEM  TO GITMO. BUT, SADLY, GITMO IS NOT THE  CARIBBEAN PICK A BODY LEAVE A  BODY TRAY IT USED TO BE.
MORE THAN HALF THE DETAINEES  AT THE GUANTANAMO PRISON ARE NOW  ON HUNGER STRIKE.
THE HUNGER STRIKERS ARE THE  ANONYMOUS PEOPLE FROMIEMEN AND  OTHER COUNTRIES WHO ARE NOT EVEN DEEMED A THREAT ANYMORE. THEY'VE NEVER BEEN CHARGED. THEY ARE JUST SITTING THERE AND  THEY'RE IN UTTER DESPAIR.
INMATES ARE ASKING PEOPLE  AROUND THE WORLD TO PAY  ATTENTION TO THEIR PLIGHT.
GOOD TRY, BUT YOU WON'T GET  HEADLINES ABOUT A HUNGER STRIKE. CASE IN POINT-- NOBODY TALKED  ABOUT GAWNDA UNTIL HE HAD THE  NIP SLIP WHICH IS WHY I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY BARACK OBAMA GAVE  THEM ALL THIS FREE PUBLICITY ON  TUESDAY.
IT IS NOT A SURPRISE TO ME  THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS IN  GUANTANAMO. WHEN I WAS ELECTED IN 2008 I  SAID WE NEED TO CLOSE  GUANTANAMO. IT IS EXPENSIVE. IT IS INEFFICIENT. IT IS A RECRUITMENT TOOL FOR  EXTREMISTS. IT NEEDS TO BE CLOSED.
Stephen:  BOLD STATEMENT. ALMOST AS BOLD AS THE STATEMENT  HE MADE BACK IN JANUARY WHEN HE  CLOSED THE OFFICE OF CLOSING  GUANTANAMO. ( LAUGHTER )  NOW, HE'LL HAVE TO OPEN THE  OFFICE OF OPENING THE OFFICE OF  CLOSING GUANTANAMO. ( LAUGHTER )  AND HE'S ALREADY MAKE, EXCUSES  FOR HIS FUTURE FAILURES TO CLOSE  IT.
IT'S A HARD CASE TO MAKE  BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I THINK FOR A  LOT OF AMERICANS, THE NOTION IS OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND.
Stephen:  WHAT'S WRONG WITH  OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND? IT'S LIKE SYPHILIS-- IGNORE IT,  AND EVENTUALLY IS WILL DESTROY  THE PART OF YOUR BRAIN THAT  CARES. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  I DON'T.   ( CHEERS )   BUT THE POINT IS, FOLKS, THE  POINT IS WHEN IT COMES TO GITMO,  IGNORANCE IS BLISS. HERE TO DEBLISS ME IS RETIRED  LIEUTENANT COMMANDER IN THE  JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL CORPS, CHARLES SWIFT. MR. SWIFT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SIR, YOU WERE-- YOU WERE ONE OF  THE LEAD ATTORNEYS FOR HANDAN. AND HE WAS OSAMA BIN LADEN'S  DRIVER.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen:  YOU GUYS GOT HIM  OFF.
HE'S HOME IN YENL. HE WAS ACQUITTED.
Stephen:  YOU GOT HIM OFF,  YOU GOT HIM OFF UPON YOU SPRUK  HIM. YOU SPRUNG A TERRORIST. GOOD FOR YOU.
ACTUALLY, I LIKE TONG THAT  DUE PROCESS WORKED AND AN  INNOCENT MAN WAS RELEASED AFTER FIVE YEARS IN CAPTIVITY.
Stephen:  WE'LL NEVER KNOW  BECAUSE HE TO THE AWAY. NOW, THESE GUYS ARE TERRORISTS  AT GITMO. WHY DO WE CARE IF THEY'RE ON A  HUNGER STRIKE?
FIRST OFF, WE DON'T KNOW THAT  THEY'RE TERRORISTS.
Stephen:  YEAH, BECAUSE  THEY HAVEN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH  ANYTHING, AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE INNOCENT. THEM WE'D HAVE TO LET THEM GO,  AND THEY COULD ATTACK US FOR  HOLDING THEM WITHOUT CAUSE. ( LAUGHTER )
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, UNDER  THAT LOGIC, WE CAN DO AWAY WITH  THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR, BUT GO  AHEAD.
WELL IN THE HEART LAND OF  WHAT WE DO AS A NATION IS  SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE  CONSTITUTION. WE'RE DEDICATED AS A COUNTRY  THAT IS DEDICATED TO THE RULE OF  LAW, AND THE IDEA OF HOLDING SOMEBODY WITHOUT EVER HAVING A  TRIAL, CALLING THEM A TERRORIST  BUT NEVER GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR  INNOCENCE IS SIMPLY  ANTI-AMERICAN.
Stephen:  OKAY, BUT, WE--  WE WENT THROUGH ALL OF THIS  YEARS AGO WHEN GITMO WAS SET UP. WE HAD ALL THESE ARGUMENTS, YOU  KNOW, 10, 12 YEARS AGO. THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN THERE FOR  12 YEARS. THEY'RE ALMOST READY TO HAVE  THEIR BEHIND-BARS MITZVAH. WE DID ALL THIS, OKAY. WE SETTLED IT. WE SETTLED THAT GITMO CAN EXIST  AND THOSE PEOPLE MUST BE KEPT  THERE.
ACTUALLY, WE DIDN'T SETTLE  ANY OF THAT.
Stephen:  I DID.
WELL, YES, CONGRESS IN 2008  AFTER HAVING LET PRESIDENT BUSH  RELEASE 600 DETAINEES WITHOUT A SINGLE COMMENT --
Stephen:  16% OF WHICH WENT  BACK TO TERROR.
ACTUALLY, IN THE-- NOT 16%. IT'S CLOSER TO ABOUT 3% WERE  ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN ANYTHING,  UNLESS YOU SAY THAT WRITING AN OP-ED IS TERRORIZING.
Stephen:  IT IS.
OKAY.
Stephen:  HAVE YOU READ THE  "NEW YORK TIMES" OPINION PAGE? LAUGH OKAY.
I SEE YOUR POINT.
Stephen:  OKAY, GO AHEAD.
THE REASON THEY'RE THERE  ISN'T BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY'VE  DONE, BECAUSE OF THE THREAT THEY POSE, BUT BECAUSE CONGRESS VIEWS  THEM AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL TO  KICK AROUND, WHICH DOESN'T MAKE US SAFER. IN THE END-- AND THINK ABOUT IT  THIS WAY. IF YOU HAD A RELATIVE SOMEWHERE  IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND EVERYONE  HAD SAID THEY POSE NODE THREAT TO THE COUNTRY. THEY'D DONE NOTHING WRONG, AND  WE'RE GOING TO RETHESE THEM,  EXCEPT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED NOT TO FUND THEIR  RELEASE, WOULD YOU BE ANGRY  ENOUGH TO BOMB THAT COUNTRY?
Stephen:  I THINK WE HAVE  BOMBED MOST OF THOSE COUNTRIES  ALREADY. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. LIEUTENANT COMMANDER-- HOMELAND  ON ONE SECOND, SIR. LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CHARLES  SWIFT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
