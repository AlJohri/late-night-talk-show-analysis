Stephen: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST HAS BEEN INDUCTED INTO THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME TWICE. ONE MORE AND HE GETS A FREE RINGO.  PLEASE WELCOME NEIL YOUNG! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NEIL, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN! THANKS FOR COMING BACK! YOU LOOK FANTASTIC! NEIL, THANKS FOR BEING BACK. THANK YOU FOR DRESSING UP FOR THE OCCASION! (CHEERING) THANK YOU FOR PUTTING ON YOUR FORMAL T-SHIRT. EARTH. EARTH. WE'RE STILL INTO THE EARTH, ARE WE?
WE'RE STANDING ON IT.
I THOUGHT YOU WROTE THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A  SILVER SPACESHIP  THAT WOULD TAKE US SOMEPLACE ELSE. IS THAT DEAL OVER NOW?
WE'RE TRYING TO STOP THAT.
Stephen: WELL, NEIL, EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOUR CAREER SPANS OVER 40 YEARS. YOU HAVE 38 ALBUMS, INDUCTION INTO THE HALL OF FAME TWICE -- NO THREE TIMES?
MAYBE US
MAYBE US TOGETHER? CLAPTON'S BEEN IN THREE TIMES. OKAY. (LAUGHTER) YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED SPECIAL DELUXE, A MEMOIR OF LIFE AND CARS.
RIGHT. AND WALLPAPER.
Stephen: YES. THESE ARE ALL WATER COLORS YOU DID OF -- HOW MANY CARS HAVE YOU HAD IN YOUR LIFE?
MANY, MANY, MANY CARS.
Stephen: THESE ARE MANY, MANY CARS. I WAS LOOKING FOR A MORE SPECIFIC NUMBER FROM A GUY WHO WROTE A GOD DAMN BOOK ABOUT IT.
THANKS TO PEOPLE, THANKS TO AMERICA! THANKS TO AMERICA FOR BUILDING THESE GREAT CARS.
Stephen: THESE WOULD MAKE EXCELLENT PAJAMAS FOR AN 8-YEAR-OLD.
THEY WOULD!
Stephen: YOU'RE ONE OF THESE SAVE THE EARTH GUYS, RIGHT? YOU HAVE THE T-SHIRT.
YEAH.
Stephen: A LOT OF POLLUTION WITH CARS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. HOW CAN YOU DRIVE A HOT ROD LINCOLN IF YOU KNOW IT'S SPEWING OUT ALL THE CARBONS. DID I JUST CATCH YOU BEING A HYPOCRITE?
YOU CAUGHT ME DRIVING A 1959 LINCOLN FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO THE TAR SANDS IN ALBERTA AND TO NEW YORK CITY WITHOUT USING ONE DROP OF GASOLINE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BULL DOOKIE,  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HOW CAN YOU DRIVE A HOT ROD LINCOLN FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO THE TAR SANDS?
IT'S BEAUTIFUL TILL YOU GET THERE.
Stephen: YEAH? THEN IT LOOKS LIKE A WAR ZONE, A DISASTER AREA.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY I NEVER GO TO CANADA, BEAUTIFUL TILL YOU GET THERE.
I SPOKE TO A FEW REMAINING FISH UP THERE. THEY SAID IT WAS NOT RIGHT UP THERE.
Stephen: YOUR LINCOLN DOESN'T USE GAS?
NO, IT USES ELECTRICITY AND CELLULOSIC ETHANOL.
Stephen: SO YOU CUT THE BALLS OF A LINCOLN AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT'S FASTER THAN IT USED TO BE. IT PERFORMS BETTER. IT'S CLEANER. I HATE TO SAY THE WORD "GREEN," BUT IT IS GREEN. NO, IT'S NOT GREEN. IT'S WHITE. I LIKE WHITE, NOT GREEN CARS.
Stephen: WHY ARE CARS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?
WELL, THEY REPRESENT THE CULTURE. THEY REPRESENT OUR CULTURE AND OUR LOT -- YOU KNOW, LIKE AMERICAN HISTORY. LOOK AT THESE THINGS, THE WAY PEOPLE FELT, EXCEPT FOR THE ENGLISH CAR, THE THIRD ONE UP. THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, YOU TRIED TO GET ME TO SING A SONG ABOUT IMPEACHING THE PRESIDENT WHO, AT THE TIME, WAS GEORGE W. BUSH AND YOU WANTED TO IMPEACH HIM OVER GETTING US INTO THE WAR IN IRAQ. NOW THAT OBAMA IS GETTING US INTO A WAR IN IRAQ, ARE YOU UP FOR IMPEACHING HIM, TOO?
Stephen: NO, NO. NO?
Stephen: NO? NO.
Stephen: THEN YOU'RE A DOUBLE HYPOCRITE? DON'T CARE THIS TIME?
I THINK WE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM FOR FRACKING.
Stephen: REALLY? BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Stephen: ARE YOU AN AMERICAN? ARE YOU A CANADIAN OR AMERICAN?
I AM PART OF THE FREE WORLD.
Stephen: ARE YOU A CANADIAN OR AMERICAN?
I'M A CANADIAN.
Stephen: THERE'S THE DOOR.
NO, NO, I'M A CANADIAN. I DON'T HAVE TO GO. I STAY! I TRAVEL THE FREE WORLD.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I LOVE THE WORLD! I LOVE IT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER THING YOU'RE PUSHING HERE, IT'S THE PONO MUSIC PLAYER. WHY IS THIS BETTER THAN AN iPod OTHER THAN NOT COMING PRE-LOADED WITH THE U2 ALBUM.
THIS BUTTON GETS THE U2 ALBUM OFF OF IT AND CAME ON THE PLAYER.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE PONO? WHAT'S BETTER ABOUT THE MUSIC?
THIS MUSIC IS 100% OF THE SOUND, AND THE iPod, COMPARED TO THE BEST THIS CAN DO, IS 5% OF THE SOUND. IT'S A GREAT BARGAIN. iPOD IS A GREAT BARGAIN.
Stephen: iPOD IS A GREAT BARGAIN.
YES, IT IS, BECAUSE YOU GET TO HAVE A MILLION OF SONGS BUT YOU JUST GET A TINY BIT OF EACH ONE, BUT YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THEM.
Stephen: HOW MUCH IS THIS? THIS IS $399.
Stephen: SO NOT ONLY DOES IT LOOK LIKE A TOBLERONE, IT COSTS AS MUCH AS A TOBLERONE IN A HOTEL ROOM.
IT COSTS MORE THAN A TOBLERONE IN A HOTEL ROOM
Stephen: YOU'VE GOTTA STAY AT BETTER HOTELS (LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN. YOU FEEL THE MUSIC.
Stephen: REALLY? WHERE DO YOU PUT IT, NEIL?
THAT'S UP TO YOU, STEPHEN. LOOK AT THAT GUY. LOOK AT THOSE GUYS.
Stephen: LOOK AT THOSE GUYS.
YEAH, LOOK AT ALL THOSE AWARDS. OH, YEAH!
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHERE TO PUT IT.
THERE YOU GO. ON YOUR MANTEL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT!
Stephen: NEIL, NEIL, WILL YOU DO A SONG WITH US? (CHEERING) THE BOOK IS "SPECIAL DELUXE" WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY NEIL YOUNG! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
