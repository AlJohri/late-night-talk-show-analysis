(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THERE IS SOMETHING I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT RIGHT NOW, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THE WORLD IS FALLING APART UNDER BARACK OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP. I MEAN I'M GOING TO TELL YOU BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT NO ONE IS MAKING ME TELL YOU AND JUST WHEN AMERICA NEEDS A STRONG LEADER MORE THAN EVER WE ARE LOSING ONE OF OUR GREATEST. CAPTAIN AMERICA. HE FIRST WON OUR HEARTS IN 1941, ISSUE NUMBER 1 BY PUNCHING HITLER IN THE FACE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND THE HULK, MAY I POINT OUT THE HULK WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. I GUESS THE HOLOCAUST DOESN'T MAKE BRUCE BANNER THAT ANGRY. HULK IGNORE ATROCITIES. UNFORTUNATELY, CAP'S DAYS OF PROTECTING AMERICA ARE NUMBERED AND THAT NUMBER IS 21, JIM, RIGHT IN THERE. THERE IT IS BECAUSE UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN FROZEN IN ICE FOR THE LAST 65 YEARS, YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS ISSUE. IT'S A TALE AS OLD AS TIME. THE IRON NAIL CURRENTLY IN HIS MONSTER FORM HAS LAUNCHED A PLOT OF FRAMING CAPTAIN AMERICA BY LAUNCHING HELICARRIER GUNGNIR TO BE A FLYING ROBOT AND DESTROY THE NATION OF NROSVEKISTAN. OF COURSE ALL OF THIS IS JUST A FANTASY. IN THE REAL WORLD NROSVEKISTAN HAS BEEN ANNEXED BY VLADIMIR PUTIN. BUT-- FOLKS--  (APPLAUSE) WHEN CAP TRIES TO STOP HIM THE IRON NAIL HITS HIM WITH FLYING NEEDLES WHICH REMOVE THE SUPERSERUM FROM CAPTAIN AMERICA'S BLOOD CAUSING HIM TO LOSE HIS SUPERSOLDIER POWERS AND INSTANTLY AGE 65 YEARS. MEANING HIS NEW SUPERSERUM WILL BE ENSURE. I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. I MEAN CAPTAIN AMERICA WAS THIS CLOSE TO BEING PROMOTED TO MAJOR AMERICA. THIS IS A DISASTER, NATION, WITH STEVE ROGERS BROUGHT THERE IS A HUGE VOID IN THE CAPTAINING OF AMERICA. I MEAN WHO AMONG US IS PREPARED TO STEP IN? I MEAN-- OBVIOUSLY--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN! I GOT TO SAY THAT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO ME. BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY PATRIOTIC. YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK DECADES YOUNGER THAN YOUR ACTUAL AGE AND IT SHOULD BE SOMEONE WHO ALREADY OWNS CAPTAIN AMERICA'S ACTUAL SHIELD. THAT'S RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S RIGHT. THE SHIELD'S BEEN UP THERE SINCE 2007. I NEEDED IT IN MY BATTLE AGAINST NICKELBACK. AND I FOR ONE, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL BE PROUD TO WEAR THAT LETTER A AND THIS TIME IT WON'T BE BECAUSE I COMMITTED ADULTERY WITH A 17th CENTURY REVEREND. BUT WHO ULTIMATELY, WHO CAN SAY WHO THE NEXT CAPTAIN AMERICA WILL BE. HERE TO SAY WHO THE NEXT CAPTAIN AMERICA WILL BE IS THE CHIEF CREATIVE OFFICER OF MARVEL AND FRIEND OF THE SHOW, JOE QUASADA. THANKS SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS FOR BEING HERE THANKS FOR FLYING OVER IN YOUR HELICARRIER.
YEAH.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON CAPTAIN AMERICA,  WHAT DID YOU DO TO THIS GUY?
HE SAVED THE WORLD AGAIN BUT NOT WITHOUT PERSONAL SACRIFICE, HE LOST THE SUPER SOLDIER SERUM.
WITHOUT STEVE ROGERS, WHO IS GOING TO KEEP THE  GUATEMALAN KIDS FROM COMING OVER OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.
STEVE HAD TO HAND THE MANTLE OVER.
WHO, WHO, DON'T BREAK MY HEART HERE. AM I THE NEXT CAPTAIN AMERICA?
NO, STEPHEN.
ALL RIGHT, JOE IF I'M NOT THE NEXT CAPTAIN AMERICA, WHO IS.
SAM WILSON, HIS PARTNER, THE FALCON, IS BECOMING THE NEW CAPTAIN AMERICA.
THE FALCON? WELL, IF THERE IS ONE BIRD ASSOCIATED WITH AMERICA IT IS THE FALCON.
WAIT A SECOND, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. IS THIS THE FALCON.
THAT IS AND THERE'S THE FALCON AS NEW CAPTAIN AMERICA.
THERE IS JUST-- IS THIS IN THE MOVIES.
THIS IS STRICTLY IN THE COMICS.
THE COMICS ARE THE BEST BUT LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, THIS GUY, THIS NEW, THIS NEW GUY IS BLACK.
YES.
DOESN'T THAT MAKE HIM CAPTAIN AFRICAN-AMERICA?
I DIDN'T KNOW, I'M JUST ASKING.
I DON'T SEE COLOR.
YOU DON'T SEE COLOR, NEITHER DO I. IF YOU DON'T SEE COLORS HOW DO YOU DO COMIC BOOKS? ALL RIGHT, WAIT A SECOND, OKAY, IF FALCON IS NOW CAPTAIN AMERICA DIDN'T THAT MEAN THERE'S ANOTHER VOID, DON'T WE NEED A NEW FALCON.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION, STEPHEN, AND WE REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS AT MARVEL AND THAT OPENING IS AVAILABLE AND-- FOLKS, DO YOU THINK--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY CHANCE.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! THAT'S SPONTANEOUS.
TRY THIS OUT, WE COMMISSIONED ONE OF OUR GREAT ARTISTS TO DO AN IMAGE OF YOU AS THE FALCON.
JIM, DO WE HAVE THAT?
THERE IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I-- I DIDN'T REALIZE PEOPLE KNEW I HAD BEEN WAXING MY CHEST. I'VE GOT A GREAT CATCH-PHRASE FOR THE FALCON.
LET'S HERE IT.
Stephen: WHY DID THE FALCON CROSS THE ROAD?
I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: FOR JUSTICE MOTHER [BLEEP]  JOE QUESADA. MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
