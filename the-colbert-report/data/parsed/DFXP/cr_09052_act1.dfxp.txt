[EAGLE CAW]
Stephen: TONIGHT, DO STATES  HAVE TO FOLLOW FEDERAL LAW? ONLY  IF IT STARTS WITH "SIMON SAYS." BAILIFF LF. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, WHAT'S THE LATEST NEWS IN  THE WAR ON TERROR? THE ANSWER IS REDACTED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND MY GUEST GEORGE SAUNDERS  WROTE WHAT THE NEW YORK TIMES  CALLED "THE BEST BOOK YOU'LL READ THIS YEAR."  JOKE'S ON THEM, I'M NOT READING  ANY BOOKS THIS YEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] EATING LUNCH EARLIER CAN HELP  YOU LOSE WEIGHT. THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS EAT  TOMORROW'S LUNCH TONIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE BROADCAST,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN B.C. [  THANK YOU, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK SO MUCH. PLEASE, NATION, HEROS SIT DOWN. WELCOME TO THE BROADCAST, COMING  TO YOU, AS ALWAYS, IN  BONE-JOSTLING SENSURROUND! [ LAUGHTER ] A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY. [ LAUGHTER ] NATION, FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN  WARNING YOU ABOUT IRAN. THEY'RE ALMOST AS BIG A THREAT  AS OUR OTHER ENEMY EE-RAHN. FRIGHTENING. ALSO, FREETENING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NOW THERE'S AN EVEN BIGGER  REASON TO BE AFRAID.
IRAN HAS JUST LAUNCHED A  MONKEY INTO SPACE, LAUDING IT IS  AN ADVANCE IN MISSILE AND SPACE PROGRAM THAT ALARMED THE WEST  AND ISRAEL.
HOW DID THEY LAUNCH A MONKEY  INTO SPACE? [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: EXCELLENT QUESTION,  GRETCHEN. HOW DID THEY LAUNCH A MONKEY  INTO SPACE? [ LAUGHTER ] THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS. [ LAUGHTER ] DID THEY USE A GIANT SLINGSHOT? OR A MONKEY SIZED T-SHIRT  CANNON? [ LAUGHTER ] OR DID THEY DO THE OBVIOUS: PUT  YELLOW-TINTED GLASSES ON A  MONKEY AND WAIT UNTIL A CRESCENT MOON SO IT THINKS IT'S A BANANA  AND CLIMBS UP THERE HIMSELF? [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DID THEY DO IT?!
THEY'VE GOT ROCKETS OVER  THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: HUH. THEY'VE GOT ROCKETS OVER THERE. I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, ALL THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN  WORRYING ABOUT ENRICHED  URANIUM-- IRAN HAS BEEN ACQUIRING WEAPONS OF MACAQUE  DESTRUCTION. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WON'T BE LONG UNTIL ICBM'S--  INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC  MONKEYS-- ARE HURLING THEIR FECES DOWN ON US FROM THEIR  SUB-ORBITAL TIRE SWINGS! WHAT HAPPENED TO AMERICA? WHEN I WAS A KID, WE LED THE  WORLD IN AIRBORNE CHIMP  TECHNOLOGY, AND EVERY CHILD DREAMT OF GROWING UP TO LAUNCH A  BEWILDERED, FRIGHTENED ANIMAL  INTO THE ICY VOID OF SPACE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SADLY WE CANCELED THAT  PROGRAM. AND FOLKS, THIS NEWS COULD NOT  COME AT A WORSE TIME, BECAUSE  THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH "ANNOUNCED A MORATORIUM  ON NEW CHIMP RESEARCH FUNDING."  AND THEY'RE "RETIRING 110 GOVERNMENT-OWNED CHIMPS,"  DESPITE THE FACT THAT  DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING, OUR  CHIMP SANCTUARY SYSTEM HAS NO MORE SPACE. SO NOW ALL THOSE APES THAT WE  COULD HAVE HUMANELY FIRED INTO  THE SUN ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED ONTO THE STREETS! BUT I'M SURE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO  FORGIVE AND FORGET ALL THAT  SCIENTIFIC TESTING WE PUT THEM THROUGH AND LIVE TOGETHER IN  PEACE. RIGHT? OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD! PLEASE. WE'VE GOT TO GET THE AYATOLLAHS  TO SHOOT OUR RETIRED CHIMPS INTO  SPACE. OH, THEY'LL NEVER DO IT-- UNLESS  WE TELL THEM THE CHIMPS ARE GAY  ISRAELIS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'LL DO ANYTHING TO GET THEM  OFF THE PLANET. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT FOLKS, THE OTHER THREAT TO  AMERICA IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S  RECENT 23-POINT EXECUTIVE ORDER GUN-CONTROL GRAB-ORAMA. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS A FULL-ON ASSAULT ON OUR  RIGHT TO FULL-ON ASSAULT. THAT'S WHY IT'S MORE IMPORTANT  THAN EVER TO REMEMBER THE GUN  RIGHTS ADVOCATE BATTLE CRY.
FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: FUN FACT: THAT WAS  HIS AUDITION FOR "WHEN HARRY MET  SALLY." [ LAUGHTER ] YET THEY GAVE THE PART TO MEG  RYAN. TOUGH BEING A CONSERVATIVE IN  HOLLYWOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS TYRANNY WILL NOT STAND,  MAN. TRUE DEFENDERS OF THE  CONSTITUTION ARE FIGHTING BACK. BILLS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN ALL  THESE STATES THAT WOULD "MAKE IT  ILLEGAL TO ENFORCE ANY OF THE NEW FEDERAL GUN CONTROL  MEASURES."  THAT'S RIGHT. THAT MEANS IF AN AGENT OF THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRIES TO TAKE  YOUR HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINE, JUST CALL 9-1-1 AND SAY "POLICE! COME QUICK! SOMEONE'S TRYING TO ENFORCE THE  LAW." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN THEY'LL SEND IN A SWAT TEAM  TO SHOOT THEMSELVES. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE THESE STATES KNOW THAT  -- THESE STATES THAT AREN'T UP  HERE RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW WHICH ONES THEY ARE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY KNOW THAT  THERE'S A HIGHER AUTHORITY THAN  SOME STUPID LAW MADE BY  WASHINGTON CLOWNS ON CAPITOL HILL, AND THAT'S SOME STUPID LAW  MADE BY LOCAL CLOWNS IN YOUR  STATE CAPITOL. [ LAUGHTER ] AND NOBODY OUT-STUPID'S  MISSISSIPPI, WHERE A NEW BILL TO  PROTECT STATE SOVEREIGNTY HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY STATE  REPRESENTATIVE AND MAN WHOSE  TOYS COME TO LIFE AT NIGHT, JEFF [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JEFF SMITH. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS MISSISSIPPI LAW WOULD  CREATE A COMMITTEE TO HELP  NEUTRALIZE FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF  THE POWERS IN THE CONSTITUTION. YES, ALL FEDERAL LAWS THEY  DISAGREE WITH WOULD BE  NEUTRALIZED. IT'S LIKE LEGAL FEBREEZE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I THINK HE MIGHT WANT SOME  FEBREEZE AFTER THOSE TWO TEMPURA  SHRIMP ARE DONE MATING ON HIS UPPER LIP. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, EACH STATE PICKING AND  CHOOSING WHICH LAWS TO OBEY  FINALLY REALIZES THE VISION OF OUR FOREFATHERS. AS LINCOLN SAID, "A HOUSE  DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF-- SOUNDS  FUN! WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?" [ LAUGHTER ] HERE TO TELL ME THE WORST THAT  COULD HAPPEN IS FORMER ASSOCIATE  WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL AND CO-AUTHOR OF "THE GREAT  DECISION: JEFFERSON, ADAMS,  MARSHALL, AND THE BATTLE FOR THE SUPREME COURT," CLIFF SLOAN. FRIEND OF THE SHOW. CLIFF, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING  BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU GOT THE BOOK HERE. "THE GREAT DECISION" YOU KNOW  WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. THERE'S THIS WORD I HEAR TOSSED  AROUND AND STATES SAYING WE'RE  NOT GOING TO OBEY THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT. THEY CALL IT NULLIFICATION. WHAT IS THAT? IS IT A LEGAL TECHNOLOGY I DON'T  KNOW ABOUT?
NULLIFICATION IS WHEN STATE  AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SAY A  FEDERAL LAW IS NULL AND VOID BECAUSE IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL  AND SO THEY ARE NOT GOING TO  FOLLOW IT.
Stephen: THIS IS A SETTLED  PRACTICE. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
IT'S HAPPENS AND IT HAS AULD  FAILED.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHEN?
THE CIVIL WAR WAS ONE  EXAMPLE.
Stephen: ANYTHING ELSE? ONE LITTLE EXAMPLE, HOW IS THE  CIVIL WAR TIED TO THESE KIND OF  LAWS?
WELL, BECAUSE THE STATES --  THE SOUTHERN STATES SAID ERIC  WITH DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHAT  LINCOLN IS GOING TO SAY IN TERMS  ABOLISHING SLAVERY. IT'S NULL AND VOID AND THEY TOOK  IT A STEP FURTHER AND IS A  SEEDED. AFTER BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF  EDUCATION, THE SOUTHERN STATES  PASSED NULLIFICATION AND THEY HAD TO SEND TROOPS TO ARKANSAS  TO ENSURE THE FEDERAL LAW.
Stephen: WHERE DO THE  STATES GET OFF? WHEN DOES THE STATE IN THE  CONSTITUTION THAT THE FEDS CAN  TELL THE STATE WHAT'S TO DO?
ARTICLE 6 IN THE --
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY QUICK  DRAW MCGRAW OVER THERE. THE TENTH AMENDMENT SAID IFING  SOMETHING IS NOT SPECIFICALLY  COVERED THE RIGHT GOODS TO THE  STATES. MAYBE NULLIFICATION IS SAY  SPECIAL RIGHT.
IF YOU THINK THERE'S A  CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION YOU  FILE SUIT IN COURT. AS THE SUPREME COURT SAID IN  STEPHON MARBURY VERSUS MADISON  THE SUPREME COURT SAID.
Stephen: THE SUPREME COURT  SAID THE SUPREME COURT SAYS WHAT  IS CONSTITUTIONAL.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
Stephen: HOW CONSCREENENT  IT'S CALLED ACTIVITY JUDGES  RIGHT THERE.
IT'S CALLED ARTICLE 3 OF THE  CONSTITUTION BECAUSE ARTICLE 3  SAYS THAT THE JUDICIAL POWER OF THE UNITED STATES RESTS IN THE  SUPREME COURT AND THE OTHER  FEDERAL COURTS.
Stephen: THERE'S NOTHING IN  THE CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS THE  CONSTITUTION IS CONSTITUTIONAL. CHECK AND MATE! [ LAUGHTER ]
WRONG AGAIN.
Stephen: OKAY.
WRONG AGAIN BECAUSE THE  SUPREMACY CLAUSE SAYS THAT THE  CONSTITUTION AND THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE THE SUPREME  LAW OF THE LAND. IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE  CONSTITUTION.
Stephen: THE STATES SHOULD  PASS A RATIFIED NEW AMENDMENT  THAT SAYS BE IT KNOWN YOU ARE NOT --
IF THEY DID THAT IT WOULD BE  UP TO THE FEDERAL COURTS COURTS TO  INTERPRET IT.
Stephen: WILL THERE BE  TROOPS IN TENNESSEE TELLING  LOCAL SHERIFFS TO ENFORCE THIS  LAW?
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN? THIS IS RHETORIC. THEY HAVE THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS. ONE OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS  CALLS FOR A DIALOG ON MENTAL  HEALTH.
Stephen: THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT CANNOT COME IN WITH  JACK BOOTED DIALOGGERS AND TALK ABOUT THINGS WE DON'T WISH TO  CONSIDER.
IF YOU WANT TO OBJECT TO THE  DIALOG FILE A SUIT. CAN I RECOMMEND LAWYERS TO YOU.
Stephen: I BET YOU CAN.
AND BRING A CASE YOURSELF.
Stephen: CLIFF THANKS SO  MUCH FOR JOINING ME. I'LL BE CALLING THE LAWYER. CLIFF
