[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, FOLKS, IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE SHOW FOR THE PAST EIGHT AND A HALF YEARS, YOU KNOW THERE IS ONE MORAL EVIL I'VE CRUSADED AGAINST SINCE THIS SHOW BEGAN. IT'S BOW TIE PASTA. ALSO GAY MARRIAGE. BUT DESPITE MY FIRM BELIEF THAT MARRIAGE IS MEANT TO BE BETWEEN ONE MAN, ONE WOMAN, SUPPORT FOR SAME-SEX MARRIAGE HAS SPREAD LIKE DYSENTERY THROUGH A CRUISE SHIP. JIM?
A NEW GALLUP POLL FINDS SUPPORT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY HAS HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. 55% OF AMERICANS NOW SAY SAME-SEX  MARRIAGE MARRIAGES SHOULD BE LEGALLY VALID WITH THE SAME  RIGHTS AS TRADITIONAL MARRIAGES.
LET'S LOOK HOW QUICKLY ATTITUDES CHANGE. IN 2004, AN ABC/"WASHINGTON POST" POLL FOUND GAY MARRIAGE WAS OPPOSED BY 59% OF AMERICANS. JUST TEN YEARS LATER, SUPPORTED BY 59%. GAY ICON JOHN STOSSEL IS RIGHT. EVER SINCE THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, MORE AND MORE STATES HAVE RUN THEIR OWN SAME-SEX BANS THROUGH THE GRINDER. [LAUGHTER] GAY PEOPLE ARE WINNING THIS WAR, FOLKS. AT LAST COUNT GAY MARRIAGES ARE NOW FULLY RECOGNIZED IN 19 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. SO A WARNING TO ALL THOSE CONGRESSMEN WHO SHARE AN APARTMENT TO HELP SAVE MONEY. YOU ARE TEETERING ON THE EDGE OF A COMMON LAW GAY FLOPHOUSE. AND THE LATEST STATE TO GET TRAMPLED BY THE GAY PRIDE PARADE, WISCONSIN. JUST TWO WEEKS AGO FEDERAL JUDGE OVERTURNED THE STATE'S BAN ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. NOT SURPRISING. I MEAN, THAT WHOLE STATE IS LITERALLY A SAUSAGE-FEST. THANKFULLY, WISCONSIN CONSERVATIVES ARE FIGHTING BACK.
WEDDING BELLS WILL NOT BE RINGING JUST YET FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES IN WISCONSIN.
THE SAME JUDGE WHO JUST LAST WEEK OVERTURNED THE STATE'S BAN ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE NOW SAYS COUPLES WILL HAVE TO WAIT WHILE THE STATE'S ATTORNEY GENERAL APPEALS THE RULING.
Stephen: YES, OVER 550 SAME-SEX COUPLES WITH MARRIAGE LICENSES ARE STUCK IN LEGAL LIMBO, WHICH I BELIEVE IS ALSO THE NAME OF ONE OF THEIR BARS, BUT IT MAY BE LOSING FIGHT, FOLKS, BECAUSE THERE ARE HINTS THAT WISCONSIN GOVERNOR AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SCOTT WALKER IS RECONSIDERING HIS STANCE ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER, WHO HAS GONE ON RECORD OPPOSING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, SAID SINCE THE BAN WAS LIFTED, HIS  OPINION ON THE ISSUE NO LONGER MATTERS.
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK NOW.
ARE YOU RETHINKING YOUR POSITION ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE?
NO I'M JUST NOT STATING ONE AT ALL.
Stephen: YES. HE'S JUST NOT STATING ONE AT ALL. AND I BELIEVE WE MUST ALL RESPECT WALKER'S PRIVACY AT THIS DIFFICULT TIME TO BE AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE. THIS IS A PERSONAL MATTER BETWEEN HIM AND HIS POLLSTER. IT IS NONE OF THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS WHAT WALKER DECIDES IN THE PRIVACY OF HIS OWN GOVERNOR'S MANSION. IN FACT, I TOO HAVE FELT THE CHANGING TIDES AND SO TONIGHT IN SOLIDARITY WITH SCOTT WALKER, I STEPHEN COLBERT AM OFFICIALLY TAKING NO STAND ON GAY MARRIAGE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHERE DO I FIND THE INDIFFERENCE? YES, I MAY HAVE SOME SAID SOME CRISP THINGS ABOUT IT IN THE PAST, LIKE 90 SECONDS AGO, BUT I HAVE TAKEN A HARD LOOK AT PUBLIC OPINION, AND I'VE DECIDED TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT... OR GAY. IT MAY OR MAY NOT MATTER TO ME. THE POINT IS I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT MY UNWILLINGNESS TO EXPRESS OR EVEN SAY THE WORDS. OF MY OPINION. THE POINT IS, THE POINT IS I'M HERE, THEY'RE QUEER, LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. WHEN WE RETURN,I WILL TALK ABOUT THE VERY SAME THING WITH MY GUESTS DAVID BOIES AND TED OLSON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
