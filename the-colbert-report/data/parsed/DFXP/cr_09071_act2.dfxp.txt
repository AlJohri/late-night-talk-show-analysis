Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --  NATION -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, THERE IS NO GREATER  FRIEND OF OUTER SPACE THAN YOURS  TRULY. SO NATURALLY, I WAS DISAPPOINTED  WHEN NASA'S BUDGET WAS SLASHED. BUT, FOLKS, THERE IS SOME GREAT  NEWS FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR  ANSWER.
MILLIONAIRE SPACE TOURIST  DENNIS TITO WANTS TO SEND  TWO PEOPLE TO THE RED PLANET ON A 500-DAY JOURNEY.
HE IS CONVINCED IT WILL BE  FEASIBLE BY 2018.
WE HAVE NOT SENT HUMANS  BEYOND THE MOON IN 40 YEARS. I'VE BEEN WAITING MYSELF, AND A  LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE MY AGE HAVE  BEEN WAITING AND WAITING.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THIS BRAVE ENTREPRENUER WILL  SEND TWO ASTRONAUTS TO MARS FOR  THE NOBLEST REASON THERE IS:  IMPATIENCE. [LAUGHTER] IT REMINDS ME OF JOHN F. KENNEDY'S FAMOUS SPEECH ABOUT  PUTTING A MAN ON THE MOON, "WE  CHOOSE TO GO THE MOON NOT BECAUSE IT IS EASY--  BUT COME ON, IT'S GOT TO BE  EASY, RIGHT? LET'S JUST DO IT ALREADY. JUST STRAP A ROCKET TO SOME  GUY'S BACK. JEESH!" [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BE WARNED FOLKS. THIS 501-DAY ROUND-TRIP FLYBY IS  NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART  BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO SHOWERS, LIMITS ON TOILET PAPER  AND CLOTHING, DRINKING WATER  MADE FROM THE CREW MEMBERS' RECYCLED URINE AND SWEAT  AND ALMOST NO PRIVACY. IN OTHER WORDS, BASICALLY A  CARNIVAL CRUISE. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] STILL -- STILL. BEING THE FIRST HUMAN TO ORBIT  THE RED PLANET IS A MEMORY  YOU'LL NEVER FORGET, THAT IS, UNTIL THE RADIATION FROM THE SUN  ACCELERATES THE ONSET OF  ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. [LAUGHTER] WHICH EXPLAINS NEIL ARMSTRONG'S  FAMOUS WORDS, "THAT'S ONE SMALL  STEP FOR MAN-- THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN." [LAUGHTER] FORTUNATELY, THERE IS A PLAN TO  DEAL WITH THE HARMFUL  RADIATION-- THE ASTRONAUTS WILL USE A POOP SHIELD TO BLOCK  COSMIC RAYS, WHERE HUMAN  WASTE COULD BE STORED IN BAGS USED TO LINE THE CAPSULE. THE GOOD NEWS IS BROWN IS A  NEUTRAL COLOR, SO IT GOES WITH  EVERYTHING. [LAUGHTER] BUT BY FAR THE BEST PART OF  TITO'S SPACE PLAN IS WHO HE  WANTS TO SEND INTO SPACE.
HE'S LOOKING FOR A MARRIED  COUPLE.
IT'S A MAN-WOMAN TEAM, THAT'S  INTERESTING, BECAUSE THEY'RE  GOING TO SPEND 17 MONTHS UP THERE TOGETHER IN A SPACE  CAPSULE THAT'S SAID TO BE THE  SIZE OF A SMALL BATHROOM. THAT'S RIGHT. COUPLES ONLY. IMAGINE THE ROMANCE, FLOATING  THROUGH THE STARS, AND  SHARING A GLASS OF YOUR LOVER'S RECYCLED PEE. [LAUGHTER] AND LIKE ALL COUPLES, YOU'LL BE  REDECORTATING. "SHOULD WE MAKE THIS WALL ALL  YOUR POOP, AND THIS ONE ALL  MINE? OR SHOULD WE GO: YOUR POOP, MY  POOP, YOUR POOP, MY POOP." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] I JUST WANT TO TAKE A SECOND  HERE TO POINT OUT THAT RECEIVED  APPLAUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OF COURSE PROSPECTIVE COUPLES  WILL WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE UP  FOR THE VOYAGE. SO TO TEST IT OUT, YOU AND YOUR  PARTNER SHOULD SPEND A MONTH IN  A GEO METRO DRINKING EACH OTHER'S URINE AND COVERING THE  WINDOWS WITH YOUR OWN WASTE. AND IF A COP ASKS WHAT YOU'RE  DOING, JUST TELL THEM YOU'RE  TRAINING TO BE AN ASTRONAUT. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
