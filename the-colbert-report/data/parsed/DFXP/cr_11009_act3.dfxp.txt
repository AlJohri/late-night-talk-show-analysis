STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK CALLED "THE INNOVATORS" ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE COMPUTER. IN THE EARLY DAYS, YOU HAD TO WATCH PORNOGRAPHY ON PUNCH CARDS. PLEASE WELL COME WALTER ISAACSON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WALTER, THANKS FOR COMING BACK! NO NEED TO GET UP. YOU'RE ONE OF MY MORE IMPRESSIVE GUESTS -- AND I'VE HAD PRESIDENTS AND POPES ON HERE. YOU'RE THE C.E.O. OF THE ASPEN INSTITUTE, WHICH MEANS YOU'RE A BOND VILLIAN, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF CNN, FORMER EDITOR OF "TIME MAGAZINE," WRITTEN ABOUT STEVE JOBS, EINSTEIN, BEN FRANKLIN, AND YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "THE INNOVATORS," HOW A GROUP OF HACKERS, GENIUSES AND GEEKS CREATED THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION. HOW DO YOU DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN HACKERS AND GENIUSES AND GEEKS?
A HACKER HAS A WHOLE LOT OF FUN. WE SORT OF MISUSE THE WORD HACKER TODAY.
STEPHEN: THEY'RE DANGEROUS PEOPLE, LIKE CYBERTERRORISTS, AREN'T THEY?
NO, THEY KNOW HOW TO DO PRANKS AND SHORT CUTS ON COMPUTERS. I'M TRYING TO RESURRECT THE IDENTITY OF HACKERS. AND GENIUSES, YOU KNOW WHAT A GENIUS IS.
STEPHEN: IT'S THAT GUY WHO SHAVES ME EVERY MORNING.
AND GEEKS.
STEPHEN: WE TALKIN DWEEBS? NERDLINGERS? YEAH, AND THEY COULD TAKE OVER THE WORLD. IT'S A COOL THING THE GEEKS ARE GONNA INHERIT THE EARTH.
STEPHEN: OKAY, SO NOW STEVE JOBS IS ON THE COVER. LET'S SEE WHO'S ON HERE. STEVE JOBS IS ON THE COVER, THEN BILL GATES, ALAN TOURING DOWN THERE? AND THEN YOU'VE GOT LIKE A NAKED LADY UP THERE. IS THAT CHERYL SANDBERG?
CHERYL SANDBERG'S PATRON SAINT.
STEPHEN: ADA LOVELACE. YES!
STEPHEN: WE'RE HUGE ADA LOVELACE FANS AT THE REPORT. WHO IS SHE AND WHY DO I LOVE HER?
SHE WAS LORD BYRON'S DAUGHTER BUT HER MOM DIDN'T WANT HER TO BECOME A ROMANTIC POET, IF YOU KNEW LORD BYRON YOU'D UNDERSTOOD.
STEPHEN: 'SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY LIKE THE NIGHT,' YES
VERY GOOD.
STEPHEN: GENIUS. BUT SHE FELT THAT -- NO, NO, NO... (LAUGHTER) BUT SHE FELT THAT HER MOTHER WANTED HER TO BE A GREAT MATHEMATICIAN, HAD HER TUTORED MAINLY IN MATH AND SHE COMBINED POETRY --
STEPHEN: DID THE LADIES DO THAT BACK THEN IN THE 1840s?
NOT OFTEN, BUT THAT'S A SHAME, BECAUSE ADA LOVELACE WAS A PIONEERING MATHEMATICIAN AND SHE HAS A FRIEND CHARLES BABBAGE MAKING A CALCULATING MACHINE AND ADA SEES THE PUNCH CARD DOING THE MECHANICAL LOOMS AND BEAUTIFUL TAPESTRY AND SHE SAYS WITH BABBAGE'S MACHINE, YOU COULD USE PUNCH CARDS THAT WOULDN'T JUST DO NUMBERS, IT COULD DO WORDS AND MUSIC AND ART AND COMES UP WITH THE CONCEPT OF THE GENERAL COMPUTER, WHICH IS VERY COOL.
STEPHEN: HOW MUCH OF THIS BOOK IS JUST SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T FIT INTO STEVE JOBS BIOGRAPHY? YOU SAY DAMN IT, I'M GOING TO TAKE A VACATION AND BIND IT UP PUT IT BETWEEN TWO COVERS AND CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE.
WELL IT IS THE STORY OF HOW STEVE JOBS HAPPENED. HE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A VACCUUM. IT'S ALL THE THINGS  THAT LED UP TO HIM AND ALL THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT.
STEPHEN: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? STEVE JOBS, HE'S ONE OF THE GREAT INNOVATORS.
HE IS ABSOLUTELY A GREAT INNOVATOR. ONE OF THE THINGS I FOUND INTERESTING ABOUT STEVE IS WE THINK OF HIM AS SORT OF A GREAT SINGULAR ROMANTIC HERO.
STEPHEN: HIM IN A GARAGE, RIGHT? HIM IN A GARAGE. BUT ACTUALLY, HE'S GOOD AT FORMING TEAMS. EVEN THOUGH HE'S A PRETTY STRONG TOUGH LEADER, HE BUILDS LOYAL TEAMS AROUND HIM AND ONE OF THE THEMES OF THE BOOK IS IT'S NOT JUST THE LONE INVENTER SITTING IN THE GARAGE HAVING A LIGHT BULB MOMENT, IT'S PEOPLE THAT CAN ACTUALLY EXECUTE. VISION WITHOUT EXECUTION IS JUST HALLUCINATION. STEVE ISRABLE TO SIT THERE IN HIS GARAGE WITH WOZNIAK AND OTHERS AND FORM THE COOLEST TEAM.
STEPHEN: SO THE GREATEST INNOVATIONS ARE COMING ABOUT WITH PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER.
COLLABORATION AND TEAMWORK.
STEPHEN: HOW COME THERE'S ONLY ONE NAME ON THIS, AND IT'S WALTER ISAACSON, OKAY? (APPLAUSE)
I WILL TELL A STORY WHICH IS, WHEN I WAS DOING THIS, I WAS THINKING ABOUT COLLABORATION, WHICH IS WHY THE INTERNET WAS INVENTED, SO I TOOK CHAPTERS OF THIS BOOK AND PUT THEM ON VARIOUS TYPE OF WIKI SITES ONLINE WHERE PEOPLE COULD PUT MANY OF THEIR STORIES SO MANY OF THE STORIES IN THE BOOK CAME FROM AN INTERNET COLLABORATION, THE PEOPLE LIKE DAN BURKLAND WHO DID VISICAL SAID HERE'S HOW WE DID IT, SO I PUT THAT IN THE BOOK, BUT I GOT TO PUT MY NAME ON IT (LAUGHTER) STEPHEN: NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT NO, AT SOME POINT WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT COLLABORATIVE, BUT THERE ARE GREAT LONE GENIUSES AND VISIONARIES, NOT ME, BUT I WROTE ABOUT EINSTEIN. YOURSELF
STEPHEN: BETWEEN GATES AND JOBS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE TWO TOWERING FIGURES OF OUR MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL AGE, WHO IS ACTUALLY THE NICE GUY? OR ARE THEY BOTH?
THEY'RE BOTH GENIUSES IN THEIR OWN WAY. STEVE JOBS IS VERY INTUITIVE, HAD A SENSE OF BEAUTY, HAD AN INTUITIVE FEEL TO MAKE PROJECTS GORGEOUS. BILL GATES IS ONE OF THE GREAT BUSINESSMEN AND BUILT A GREAT CORPORATION AND ALSO A GREAT SOFTWARE CODER. JOBS WAS NEVER REALLY A SOFTWARE ENGINEER.
STEPHEN: I HEARD THEY STOLE IDEAS FROM OTHER PEOPLE, THOUGH. WHO WAS THE BIGGER PIRATE?
STEVE JOBS PUT A PIRATE FLAG ON TOP OF THE ORIGINAL MCINTOSH BUILDING AND SAID GOOD ARTISTS BORROW, GREAT ARTISTS STEAL. BUT EVERYONE TOOK IDEAS FROM EACH OTHER AND THAT'S A PROBLEM. YOU COLLABORATE, YOU TAKE IDEAS. STEVE JOBS TOOK THEM FROM XEROX. AND BILL GATES TOOK THE GRAPHIC INTERFACE WE HAVE ON COMPUTERS  THE TRASH CANS AND ICONS FROM SEEING THE ORIGINAL MCINTOSH.
STEPHEN: AND I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF HIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN ON WIKIPEDIA.
EXACTLY, AND THAT'S THE GOOD THING ABOUT COPY AND PASTE IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT INVENTIONS OF OUR TIME
STEPHEN: WELL WALTER, THANKS SO MUCH. WALTER ISAACSON,  THE BOOK IS "THE INNOVATORS"! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
