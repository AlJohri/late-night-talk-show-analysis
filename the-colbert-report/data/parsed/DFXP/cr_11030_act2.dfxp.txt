(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME! THANK YOU SO MUCH! NATION, IT'S GETTING COLDER AND COLDER OUTSIDE AND I'M STARTING TO DEVELOP A HANKERING FOR SPICED, ALCOHOLIC, DRINKABLE EGG  -- WHICH MEANS CHRISTMAS IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. NOW, USUALLY, I'D BE BRINGING YOU NEWS FROM THE FRONT IN THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS. SAY, SOME BLASPHEMER WHO CONFUSED BALTHAZAR FOR MELCHIOR OR REFUSED TO TICKLE ELMO. I MEAN, IT IS THE LORD'S WILL! DID ELMO DIE FOR NOTHING?! (LAUGHTER) BUT THIS YEAR IN THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS, CHRISTMAS IS FIGHTING BACK. THIS IS THE BLITZKRIEG ON GRINCHITUDE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HO, HO, HO! (SINGING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BACK AT YA, BIG GUY! FOLKS, CHRISTMAS NEEDS A HERO ONCE AGAIN. AND THIS YEAR, THANK GOD IT'S T.G.I. FRIDAYS.
T.G.I. FRIES SAYS IT WILL BE FLYING DRONES AROUND SOME OF ITS RESTAURANTS WITH A MISTLETOE ATTACHED TO THE DRONES. THE DRONES ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO CRUISE OVERHEAD, GUARANTEEING SOME AWKWARD MOMENTS FOR COUPLES AND STRANGERS ALIKE. THE RESTAURANT SAYS THEY HOPE THIS WILL ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO, QUOTE, MAKE THEIR MOVE. A DRONE ENCOURAGING YOU TO KISS.
Stephen: YES, T.G.I. FRIDAYS IS WEAPONIZING CHRISTMAS CHEER WITH A MISTLETOE DRONE THAT FORCES YOU TO KISS. SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP IN MIND BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR DAD TO LUNCH. (LAUGHTER) WHAT A FANTASTIC IDEA THIS IS THE ONLY THING MISSING FROM YOUR BOOZEY NIGHT OUT WAS FOUR WHIRLING BLADES STEERED BY A 16-YEAR-OLD BUSBOY. PLUS, UNLIKE OLD-FASHIONED NON-AUTONOMOUS MISTLETOE, YOU CAN'T AVOID THIS ONE BECAUSE IT BRINGS THE FORCED PUBLIC INTIMACY TO YOU! IT EVEN HAS AN HD KISS CAM TO BROADCAST YOUR SMOOCH TO THE WHOLE RESTAURANT. KISS HER! WHICH IS NOT ONLY A HECK OF A LOT OF NAUGHTY FUN, BUT ALSO GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO ASK YOUR WAITER... WHERE THE HELL IS MY JACK DANIELS SAMPLER BASKET?! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OKAY? ALL RIGHT? AND I'LL TAKE ANOTHER DIET COKE AND MALIBU, PLEASE! (LAUGHTER) FOLKS... T.G.I. FRIDAYS' MISTLETOE DRONE IS NOT JUST A GREAT WAY TO SPREAD CHRISTMAS CHEER, I BELIEVE IT COULD BE A GREAT NEW WEAPON IN THE WAR ON TERROR. BECAUSE I.S.I.S. MAY SHOW BLATANT DISREGARD FOR BASIC HUMAN DECENCY, BUT SURELY EVEN THEY RESPECT THE INTERNATIONAL LAW OF MISTLETOING. THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING ON THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF TO HARNESS THIS TECHNOLOGY. I ASSUME HE ALSO WORKS AT T.G.I. FRIDAYS. LOOK AT ALL THAT FLAIR. GENERAL DEMPSEY SIR, DEPLOY A FLEET OF MISTLETOE DRONES TO IRAQ AND SYRIA IMMEDIATELY. ONCE THE TERRORISTS SEE THAT FESTIVE SPRIG HOVERING OVERHEAD, al-BAGHDADI AND HIS TOP LIEUTENANT WILL HAVE TO KISS EACH OTHER. (LAUGHTER) AND THEN THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY BE STONED TO DEATH. MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
