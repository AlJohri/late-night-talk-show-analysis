WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY SECRET  THAT I'M A HUGE FAN OF GOING TO  THE MOVIES. IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO CATCH UP  ON MY CELL PHONECALLS. [ LAUGHTER ] ONE FILM I WAS REALLY LOOKING  FORWARD TO WAS "ZERO DARK  THIRTY," OSCAR-WINNER KATHRYN BIGELOW'S CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED  FILM ABOUT THE HUNT FOR DANIEL  DAY LEWIS. [ LAUGHTER ] I HEAR HE'S FANTASTIC. I AM SO GLAD HE'S DEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, FOLKS, I'M NEVER GOING TO  SEE IT NOW. BECAUSE MS. BIGELOW WAS SUPPOSED  TO BE MY GUEST LAST NIGHT, AND  SHE CANCELLED AT THE LAST MINUTE, AND I WAS ZERO DARK  PISSED. [ LAUGHTER ] EVIDENTLY, LADY OSCAR BAIT HERE  CHICKENED OUT OF FACING MY MUSIC  OVER A LOOMING SENATE INVESTIGATION INTO HER FILM. OOO, I AM ANGRY. EVERYONE ELSE TALK.
SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE IS  TALKING ABOUT "ZERO DARK  THIRTY," EVEN THE US SENATE.
THE SENATE COMMITTEE IS NOW  REPORTEDLY INVESTIGATING THE  MOVIE ABOUT THE HUNT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN.
THIS MOVIE SUGGESTS THAT  TORTURE MAY HAVE LED TO  INFORMATION ON BIN LADEN BEING  FOUND.
I THINK HALF AN HOUR IS  ADVICE CALL AND VIEWERS WILL GET  THE IDEA THAT TORTURE NETTED BIN  LADEN.
Stephen: EVIDENTLY HOAR IS  WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW.
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE  INFORMATION WAS THAT TRACKED  DOWN THE TERRORIST.
AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY TRIED  TO MISLEAD THEM INTO TORTURE  FINDING BIN LADEN.
Stephen: I SAY BRAVO, SENATE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. WE ARE LONG OVERDUE FOR A  THOROUGH INVESTIGATION INTO  AMERICA'S USE OF TORTURE IN  MOVIES. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT IN REALITY. WAY BACK IN 2009 PRESIDENT OBAMA  DECIDED AGAINST AN  INVESTIGATION. AND A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION  ENDED LAST YEAR WITH NO CHARGES  AND NO PUBLIC REPORT. AND THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE. BECAUSE REMEMBER, NATION, WHEN  IT COMES TO ACTUAL TORTURE,  "WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WON'T HURT YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] AND IF YOU DO KNOW, WE WILL HURT  YOU UNTIL YOU TELL US WHAT YOU  KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN  REALITY. THIS IS THE MOVIES, WHERE  AMERICANS LEARN THEIR HISTORY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW I LEARNED THAT  SLAVERY WAS BAD, AND LINCOLN  WAS KILLED BY A VAMPIRE. [ LAUGHTER ] AGAIN DANIEL DAY LEWIS IS A  GENIUS. HE WILL BE MISSED. [ LAUGHTER ] THE KEY QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER  TORTURE LED TO BIN LADEN, BUT  WHETHER IT WILL LEAD TO  OSCARRRRRR! [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE  THIS MOVIE IS RACKING  UP THE PRAISE. LAST NIGHT IT WON THE NEW YORK  FILM CRITICS MOST MOVIE AWARD. AND MY ERSTWHILE GUEST BIGELOW  SOMEHOW FOUND TIME TO ATTEND  THAT FUNCTION, SAYING "DEPICTION IS NOT ENDORSEMENT,  AND IF IT WAS, NO ARTIST COULD  EVER PORTRAY INHUMANE PRACTICES; NO AUTHOR COULD EVER WRITE ABOUT  THEM; AND NO FILM-MAKER COULD  EVER DELVE INTO THE KNOTTY SUBJECTS OF OUR TIME."  OKAY. SUBJECT CLOSED! THOUGH NOT THE SUBJECT THEY'RE  ASKING ABOUT. WHICH IS DID THE CIA FEED  BIGELOW FALSE INFORMATION TO  JUSTIFY THE CIA'S TORTURE PROGRAM AS EFFECTIVE WHEN IT IS  NOT? THAT IS A KNOTTY SUBJECT THAT  I'M NOT SURE THE SENATE IS  PREPARED TO INVESTIGATE. THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW IS FOR  KATHRYN BIGELOW TO MAKE A MOVIE  ABOUT KATHRYN BIGELOW MAKING THIS MOVIE AND THEN MAKE SURE  THAT THE CIA GIVES HER  INFORMATION THAT THE INFORMATION THEY PREVIOUSLY GAVE HER WAS  TRUE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW I KNOW THAT LOGIC MAY SEEM  TORTURED, BUT WE KNOW TORTURE  WORKS, I SAW IT IN A MOVIE! [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. â™ª
