Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS FORMER SMITHSONIAN HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR OF THE "THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER: THE MAKING OF AN AMERICAN  ICON." SO IT'S A BOOK ABOUT A SONG ABOUT A FLAG. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE. PLEASE WELCOME LONN TAYLOR! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MR. TARYLOR -- DON'T GET UP, SIR. THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING ON.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU ARE A FORMER HISTORIAN AT THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, AND YOU WORKED ON THE STAR SPANGLE BANNER RESTORATION PROJECT.
THAT'S RIGHT CORRECT.
Stephen:  LET'S SHOW THE FOLKS WHAT THE ACTUAL STAR SPANGLED BANNER IS. JIM, THROW THAT UP THERE. NOW WERE IS THIS FLAG FROM? WHAT IS IS THE HISTORY OF THIS FLAG?
NOW, HIS FLAG IS NOW AT THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. IT CAME THERE IN 1907. BUT BEFORE THAT IT WAS KEPT FOR NEARLY 100 YEARS IN AN ATTIC IN BALTIMORE. BECAUSE AFTER THE BATTLE OF FORT McHENRY, THE COMMANDER OF THE FORT, MAJOR GEORGE ARMSTEAD, ESSENTIALLY TOOK IT HOME AS A PERSONAL SOUVENIR.
Stephen:  WOW.
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE PIECE OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. IT COST 400 BUCKS.
Stephen:  THE BATTLE OF FORT McHENRY WHICH WAS 200 YEARS AGO...?
TOMORROW.
Stephen:  OK, AND THAT IS THE BATTLE FRANCIS SCOTT KEY IS DESCRIBING IN THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER.
EXACTLY. FRANCIS SCOTT KEY WAS OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATAPSCO RIVER ON A FLAG-OF-TRUCE SHIP AND HE WATCHED THE BRITISH FLEET BOMBARD FORT McHENRY FOR 27 HOURS.
Stephen:  AND THIS WAS THE FLAG OVER FORT McHENRY.
THIS WAS THE FLAG RAISED AT THE END OF THE BATTLE.
Stephen:  OK, S TO CELEBRATE AND TO COMMEMORATE THE 200th ANNIVERSARY OF THAT BATTLE AND TOMORROW HIS WRITING OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER: THE MAKING OF AN AMERICAN ICON."
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen:  THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THE SONG, ISN'T IT?
THIS IS ABOUT THE FLAG, THE SONG, THE BATTLE, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.
Stephen:  OKAY THE DIET BOOK.
EXACTLY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  HOW -- WAS THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER, THE SONG ITSELF, WAS THAT EMBRACED BY PEOPLE RIGHT AWAY?
IT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY POPULAR. IT-- IT GREW SLOWLY IN POPULARITY.
Stephen:  WHAT WAS OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM BEFORE THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER.
WE HAD RATHER PATRIOTIC SONGS. "YANKEE DOODLE," "HAIL COLUMBIA." AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE BAND AT FORT McHENRY PLAYED "YAKEE DOODLE" AT THE END OF THE BATTLE WHEN THEY RAISED THE FLAG.
Stephen:  REALLY. THEY PLAYED "YANKEE DOODLE WENT TO TOWN?"
YEAH.
Stephen:  THAT'S LIKE ENDING A BATTLE AND GOING BA-DA-DA-DUM.
WELL, THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER REALLY BECAME POPULAR AS A PATRIOTIC SONG DURING THE CIVIL WAR BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT THE FLAG. THE FLAG WAS A SYMBOL OF LOYALTY DURING THE CIVIL WAR.
Stephen:  SO HOW DID KEY COME UP WITH THIS? I MEAN, HE LITERALLY JUST WROTE IT DURING THE BATTLE?
KEY WAS AN AMATEUR POET. HE HAD WRITTEN A LOT OF POETRY BEFORE THE BATTLE. SO HE'S OUT ON THIS SHIP WATCHING THE FORT BEING BOMBARDED --
Stephen:  WHY WASN'T HE FIGHTING? WHY WAS HE WRITING POETRY INSTEAD OF FIGHTING?
HE WAS A LAWYER!
Stephen:  HE WAS A LAWYER, OKAY.
HE WAS A VERY PROMINENT WASHINGTON D.C. LAWYER. AND HE HAD GONE OUT TO THE BRITISH FLEET TO TRY TO SPRING AN AMERICAN PRISONER, A DR. BEANS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY THE BRITISH AND TAKEN OUT ON BOARD THE BRITISH FLAGSHIP
Stephen:  SO DR. BEANS WAS OUT ON THE BRITISH FLAGSHIP.
DR. BEANS.
Stephen:  AND DID THEY GET HIM BACK?
HE DID.
Stephen:  I THOUGHT THEY WOULD'VE SAID NO BEANS. HOW DID KEY MANAGE TO WRITE THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER WHEN YOU KNOW HE HAD HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART THE ENTIRE TIME. WHEN DID THAT START? DO YOU KNOW WHEN HE PUT OUR HAND OVER OUR HEART, TAKE OUR HATS OFF, STAND UP, THAT KIND OF STUFF.
WELL, BELEIVE IT OR NOT, WE USED TO PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG GOING LIKE THIS.
Stephen:  WOW. WHY ON EARTH DID THAT STOP?
IT WAS THE LIKE A ROLLING SALUTE, YOU KNOW. THE HAND OVER THE HEART, WHEN THE SONG WAS SUNG, REALLY BEGAN DURING WORD WAR ONE.
Stephen:  DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE VERSION? BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CONTROVERSIAL VERSIONS OF THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER. ROSANNE BAR, JIMI HENDRIX OF WOODSTOCK PLAYED IT.
YUP, YUP.
Stephen:  DO YOU HAVE A VERSION YOU PARTICULARLY LOVE?
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO OFFICIAL VERSION. ANY WAY THEY PLAY IT AND SING IT IS ALREADY LRT WITH ME. IT CAN BE SUNG IN SPANISH. IT CAN BE SUNG IN POLISH.
Stephen:  DON'T YOU DARE! YOU TAKE THAT BACK. YOU TAKE THAT BACK, SIR.
LIVE WHERE SPANISH IS A SECOND LANGUAGE. Stephen: WHERE, EVERYWHERE IN AMERICA?
TEXAS. ABOUT 60 MILES FROM THE BORDER.
Stephen:  DO YOU HAVE TO SING THE OFFICIAL TUNE OR CAN YOU CHANGE THE TUNE?
NO, THE TUNE IS SET BY CONGRESS.
Stephen:  REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen:  I DIDN'T REALIZE THEY WERE SO MUSICALLY GIFTED. ( LAUGHTER ).
THAT WAS THE RESULT OF A VERY INTENSE LOBBYING EFFORT BY A BALTIMORE LADY AND THE CONGRESSMAN FROM BALTIMORE. THEY LOBBYED FOR 20 YEARS TO GET CONGRESS TO MAKE THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.
Stephen:  AND WHAT WERE THEIR NAMES?
I KNEW YOU'D ASK. MRS.  HOLLOWAY. AND CONGRESSMAN CHARLES LUNTHECOM.
Stephen:  WELL DONE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  YOU SHOULD WRITE A BOOK ABOUT THIS.
I'M A HISTORIAN. WE KNOW STUFF LIKE THAT.
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen:  LONN TAYLOR. NO, YOU STAY THERE. YOU STAY THERE. THE BOOK IS "THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ♪  ♪
