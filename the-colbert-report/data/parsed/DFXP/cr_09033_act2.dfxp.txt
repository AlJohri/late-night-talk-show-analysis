( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOW IS EVERYBODY OVER THERE? YOU DOING OKAY. ALL RIGHT, ME, TOO, WOOO! FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. SIT DOWN! FOLKING IT'S THE HOLIDAY SEASON  AND WHILE I ENJOY GETTING  PRESENTS AND RETURNING THEM FOR CASH AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY I  LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT AT THIS  TIME OF YEAR TO REFLECT ON THOSE LESS FORTUNATE, AND JUST JUT  BECAUSE IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER  BY COMPARISON. THE CONGO. ANYWAY, FOLKS, THESE DAYS  THERE'S NO ONE WHO DESERVES OUR  PITY MORE THAN POLLSTERS. JUST ONE MONTH AGO EVERYONE WAS  GLUED TO THEIR PROJECTIONS ABOUT  THE RACE BETWEEN BARACK OBAMA  AND... SHOOT, WHAT'S HIS NAME? I WANT TO SAY CAKE BUNTE. NO, THAT'S THE NAME OF MY PET  CAKE. WHATEVER. THE POINT IS, AFTER THE  ELECTION, POLLSTERS DON'T HAVE  JACK SQUAT TO DO. THAT'S WHY I ADMIRE THE FOLKS  OVER THE DEMOCRATIC-LEANING  PUBLIC POLICY POLL WHO DESPITE HAVING NOTHING TO ASK WERE STILL  WILLING TO ASK IT IN A REALLY  DIVISIVE WAY. IN THEIR FIRST POSTELECTION  NATIONAL POLL PUBLISHED  YESTERDAY, THEY FOUND THAT 49% OF G.O.P. VOTERS NATIONALLY SAY  THEY THINK ACORN STOLE THE  ELECTION FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA. THAT IS TRULY SHOCKING. ESPECIALLY SINCE ACORN DOESN'T  EXIST ANY MORE. IT FOLDED TWO YEARS AGO. NOW,PPP THINKS THEY MADE THE  REPUBLICANS LOOK LIKE CONSPIRACY  NUTS, BUT I SAY THIS JUST PROVES THE CONSPIRACY GOES DEEP, SO  DEEP IT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST  ( LAUGHTER )  AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE DOESN'T  EXIST? ACORN. ( APPLAUSE )  AND WHENPPP ASKED ABOUT POSSIBLE  SOLUTIONS TO THE LOOMING FISCAL  CLIFF, THEY FOUND 39% HAD A STRONG OPINION ABOUT THE  SIMPSON-BOWLES BUDGET PLAN AND  25% OF RESPONDENTS HAD A STRONG OPINION ON THE PANETTA-BURNS  PLAN. FUN FACT-- THE PANETTA BURNS  PLAN DOES NOT EXIST, EITHER. BUT I SAY IT DISAPPOINT MEAN  IT'S NOT THE PLAN. BECAUSE I THINK WE KNOW THE  SOLUTION TO THE FISCAL CLIFF  THAT BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS CAN AGREE ON IS  NONEXISTENT. ( LAUGHTER ). SO PERSONALLY, I SALUTEPPP FOR  TURNING STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  INTO AN EPISODE OF JAY WALKING. THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY POLITICOS  UP THERE MAKE THINGS UP. SO IS CONGRESS, WHERE PARANOID  FANTASY HAS LONG BEEN EYE KEY  WEAPON IN FIGHTING THE SPECTER OF ACCOMPLISHIMENT. AND THERE WAS ANOTHER VICTORY  YESTERDAY.
THE SENATE JUST NOW HAS  MANAGED TO VOTE ON SOMETHING. THEY REJECTED A TREATY TO EXTEND  RIGHT TO THE BLIND AND DISABLED,  RIGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN THE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE 1990. THE VOTE IN THE SENATE WAS  BIPARTISAN IN SUPPORT. THEY NEEDED 66 VOTES, AND IT  FAILED.
Stephen:  IT'S A CHRISTMAS  MIRACLE! NO RIGHTS FOR DISABLED  FOREIGNERS! SUCK ON THAT, PIGGY PUDDY TINY  TIM. YOU AND THE REST OF THE GREAT  BRITAIN CRUTCH CROWD CAN EAT  YOUR GOOSE ON THE STAIRS. BUT HOW DO YOU DEFEAT SOMETHING  WITH SUCH BROAD BIPARTISAN  SUPPORT? JOHN McCAIN WAS FOR IT. GEORGE H.W. BUSH WAS FOR IT. EVEN FORMER REPUBLICAN  PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE AND  DISABLED WORLD WAR II VETERAN  BOB DOLE LEFT HIS DEATH BED IN A WHEELCHAIR TO SHOW HIS SUPPORT. AND, REMEMBER, CONGRESS IS  TECHNICALLY A DOWNGRADE FROM  DEATH BED. ( LAUGHTER )  FOR A MINUTE, IT LOOKED LIKE  BOTH SIDES MIGHT COME TOGETHER  TO AFFIRM A UNIVERSALLY SHARED VALUE, BUT COMING TO THE RESCUE  ONCE AGAIN, DR. RICK SANTORUM'S  IMAGINARYIUM.
THERE ARE SOME VERY, VERY  TROUBLING PROVISIONS THAT COULD  OPEN UP PANDORA'S BOX THAT COULD DIRECTLY AFFECT MANY FAMILIES IN  AMERICA. IMAGINE THE SITUATION IF NOW THE  STATE, THOSE WHO ARE NOT THE  PARENTS OF THESE CHILDREN, HAVE THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT IS  IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE  CHILD.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT. REAFFIRMING PROTECTIONS TO THE  DISABLED EQUALS THE U.N. COMING  BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR CHILD. IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR PARENTS TO  GET THE KIDS TO LISTEN NOW. JUST WAIT UNTIL EVERYTHING YOU  SAY HAS TO GO THROUGH THOSE  TRANSLATOR HEADSETS. ( LAUGHTER ). NOW, NOW, SURE THE IDEA THAT AN  INTERNATIONAL TREATY FOR THE  DISABLED WOULD GIVE THE U.N. RIGHTS TO TAKE YOUR KID AWAY  SOUNDS FARRED FETCHED, BUTUN  WHAT ELSE SOUNDS FARFETCHED? ANYONE LISTENING TO RICK  SANTORUM, AND YET, HERE WE ARE! ( APPLAUSE )  BESIDES, BESIDES I BELIEVE  AMERICA HAS ALREADY PROVEN ITS  COMMITMENT TO ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE DISABLED BECAUSE WITHOUT THE  AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT,  BOB DOLE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PARK CLOSE TO THE  CAPITOL, RIDE UP IN AN ELEVATOR,  AND ROLL DOWN A RAMP TO SEE HIS DYING WISH CRUSHED IN PERSON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
