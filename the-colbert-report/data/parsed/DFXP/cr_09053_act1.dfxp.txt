[EAGLE CAW]
Stephen: TONIGHT, SHOULD GAYS  AND LESBIANS BE ALLOWED TO  MARRY? YES, BUT ONLY EACH OTHER. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, BIG CHANGES FOR THE KKK. THEY'RE UPDATING THE SHEETS WITH  A DUST RUFFLE! [ LAUGHTER ] AND MY GUEST IS BILLIONAIRE  PHILANTHROPIST BILL GATES. IN ORDER TO GET HIM HERE, I HAD  TO HILL I HAD MALARIA. [ LAUGHTER ] THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE. SO CONVICTED MURDERERS, TURN OFF  YOUR TVS NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT" [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL [EAGLE CAW] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] THANK  YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN HERE AND OUT THERE, I GOTTA  TELL YOU, FOLKS THIS IS THE  AUDIENCE SO NICE THEY CHEERED ME  TWICE! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. NATION, OUR WORLD BECOMES A  LITTLE GAYER EVERY DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M STARTING TO THINK SOME DAYS  MIGHT BE GAY. AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO FINDS IT  SUSPICIOUS THAT SATURDAY AND  SUNDAY ARE ALWAYS TOGETHER ON THE WEEKENDS? [ LAUGHTER ] AND LET'S FACE IT, THESE DAYS,  THE GAYS ARE ACCEPTED EVERYWHERE  YOU GO. THEY'RE LIKE VISA CARDS, ONLY  THINNER. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, BRACE YOURSELVES, FOLKS,  BECAUSE BEING GAY JUST GOT MORE  FABULOUS.
A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS STRAIGHT  MEN ARE MORE STRESSED OUT THAN  MEN WHO ARE GAY OR BISEXUAL. THE CANADIAN STUDY SETS OUT TO  MEASURE WHETHER GAYS AND  LESBIANS EXPERIENCE LESS OVERALL ANXIETY AFTER COMING OUT OF THE  CLOSET. IN GENERAL, STRAIGHT MEN WERE  FOUND TO BE MORE STRESSED AND  DEPRESSED THAN THEIR GAY  COUNTERPARTS.
Stephen: OF COURSE, THEY'RE  LESS  STRESSED-- THEY DON'T HAVE TO  DEAL WITH WOMEN! [ LAUGHTER ] WHO ARE GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS STUDY WAS PUBLISHED IN THE  JOURNAL "PSYCHOSOMATIC  MEDICINE," WHICH IS A WONDERFUL  PUBLICATION. THERE'S A PRINT VERSION AND AN  ONLINE VERSION, OR IF YOU'RE ON  THE GO, TRY THE VERSION THAT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, THE RESEARCH TOOK PLACE IN  CANADA, SO WE STILL HAVE TO WAIT  FOR A STUDY INVOLVING HUMAN  SUBJECTS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I TOTALLY BUY IT. BECAUSE AS AN INCREDIBLY  STRAIGHT MAN, I AM INCREDIBLY  STRESSED OUT-- I'M A TICKING TIME BOMB! THAT'S WHY EVERY TIME I  ACCIDENTALLY WANDER INTO A GAY  BAR AND SEE ALL THOSE HAPPY PEOPLE, I SHOUT, "I'M READY TO  BLOW!" [ LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, THE GOOD NEWS KEEPS  COMING FOR THE GAYS. RECENTLY, THEY GOT ENDORSEMENTS  FROM THE TWO MOST POWERFUL  BRANCHES OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT: THE WHITE HOUSE, AND FOX NEWS. [ LAUGHTER ]
OUR JOURNEY IS NOT COMPLETE  UNTIL OUR GAY BROTHERS AND  SISTERS ARE TREATED LIKE ANYONE ELSE UNDER THE LAW.
REMEMBER ABOUT A YEAR AGO, HE  EVOLVED TO SEEING THINGS THIS  WAY ON GAY RIGHTS. LOOK, WE ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT,  WE AGREE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE  HERE THAT DISAGREES WITH  ANYTHING PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID ON THAT ISSUE.
Stephen: YES, WE  CONSERVATIVES ALL THINK GAYS  SHOULD HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS, AND WE'VE BEEN SAYING IT SINCE THE  BEGINNING OF THIS SENTENCE! [ LAUGHTER ] CLEARLY, THE LGBT AGENDA IS  BARRELING FORWARD AT FULL SPEED. AT THIS RATE, I MAY EVEN HAVE TO  LEARN WHAT THE LAST TWO LETTERS  OF LGBT MEAN. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANNA SAY--  BACON AND TOMATO? [ LAUGHTER ] GOD KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING  WITH THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] LUCKILY, ONE BRAVE SOUL IS  HOLDING BACK THIS RISING GAY  TIDE LIKE A ONE-MAN DIKE. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN -- I MEAN -- I MEAN --  NO, NO, --  I MEAN, WITH HORDES OF GAYS  COMING, HE'S BEATING THEM OFF. NO, NO,. I MEAN -- I MEAN --  I MEAN, IT BRINGS US TO  TONIGHT'S WORD:  IT GETS WORSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THE SUPREME COURT IS  ABOUT TO HEAR ARGUMENTS ABOUT  THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF "THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT" OR  DOMA, WHICH DEFINES MARRIAGE AS  BETWEEN ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN. THE ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN  1996 BY BILL CLINTON--  A MAN  WHO UNDERSTANDS BEING DEFENSIVE ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, BARACK OBAMA'S JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT DECIDED NOT TO DEFEND  DOMA, BUT DON'T WORRY, YOUR TAX DOLLARS ARE STILL BEING SPENT ON  THE CASE. HOUSE REPUBLICANS HIRED  SUPER-STRAIGHT, SUPER-LAWYER  PAUL CLEMENT TO DEFEND MARRIAGE TO THE TUNE OF $2 MILLION  DOLLARS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, THE CASE WON'T BE HEARD  UNTIL MARCH, BUT THAT MONEY IS  ALREADY BUYING BRILLIANT LEGAL ARGUMENTS FROM CLEMENT LIKE:  "MARRIAGE SHOULD BE LIMITED TO  UNIONS OF A MAN AND A WOMAN BECAUSE THEY ALONE CAN PRODUCE  UNPLANNED AND UNINTENDED  OFFSPRING." [ LAUGHTER ] DAMN STRAIGHT. YES! YES, MARRIAGE IS FOR STRAIGHT  PEOPLE, WHO CAN GO TO A WEDDING,  GET TANKED ON CHABLIS, AND MAKE A BABY, BAREBACKING IT IN A COAT  CLOSET. [ LAUGHTER ] AS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FANS OF THE COAT CLOSET. THAT'S HOW GOD INTENDED IT. [ LAUGHTER ] PLANNING TO HAVE KIDS JUST ISN'T  RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT PERHAPS THE STRONGEST  ARGUMENT CLEMENT YANKED OUT OF  HIS LAW-HOLE IS THIS ONE: "GAYS AND LESBIANS HAVE ATTAINED  MORE LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES,  POLITICAL POWER, AND POPULAR FAVOR IN LESS TIME THAN  VIRTUALLY ANY OTHER GROUP IN  AMERICAN HISTORY. GIVEN THAT THE ULTIMATE INQUIRY  FOCUSES ON WHETHER A GROUP NEEDS  THE SPECIAL INTERVENTION OF THE COURTS-- THE POLITICAL STRENGTH  OF GAYS AND LESBIANS IN THE  POLITICAL PROCESS SHOULD BE OUTCOME DETERMINATIVE HERE."
Stephen: YES, OUTCOME  DETERMINATIVE! [ LAUGHTER ] THAT SORT OF FANCY TALK THAT  WILL GET CLEMENT A RULING  INHISFAVORATISH. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, TRANSLATED FROM THE  ORIGINAL PARSEL-TONGUE, HE'S  SAYING, GAYS AND LESBIANS HAVE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS, SO  QUICKLY, THEY NO LONGER NEED THE  COURTS TO HELP THEM. THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR BOSS SAYS,  "YOUR HARD WORK AND DEDICATION  HAVE REALLY PROVEN THAT YOU DON'T NEED A PROMOTION." [ LAUGHTER ] FACE IT, WE'RE LIVING IN A  GOLDEN AGE OF BEING GAY. THESE DAYS SAME SEX COUPLES CAN  GET LEGALLY MARRIED FROM SEATTLE  TO BOSTON! AND ONE PLACE IN BETWEEN. [ LAUGHTER ] PLUS, THERE ARE ONLY 29 STATES  WHERE IT'S LEGAL TO DENY YOU A  JOB BECAUSE YOU'RE GAY. YOU SEE IN THE 21 OTHER STATES,  THEY HAVE TO PRETEND IT'S  SOMETHING ELSE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO GIVEN HOW WELL THINGS ARE  GOING, THERE'S NO NEED FOR THEM  TO GET BETTER. THE STRUGGLE FOR GAY RIGHTS HAS  JUST BEEN TOO SUCCESSFUL, AND  THEREFORE IT MUST END IN  FAILURE. YOU KNOW WHO REALLY GOT LUCKY? THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO REALLY  GOT LUCKY, BLACK PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] THINGS WERE SO HARD FOR THEM, WE  HAD TO HELP. BUT, IF ROSA PARKS HAD BEEN  ALLOWED TO SIT IN THE FRONT OF  THE BUS, WE WOULDN'T HAVE CARED ENOUGH TO DESEGREGATE OUR  SCHOOLS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, AS A SUPPORTER OF GAY  RIGHTS, SOME OF YOU MIGHT FEEL  BAD THAT THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE THIS STRUGGLE THAT THEY SO  DESERVEDLY WON. PERHAPS, YOU HAVE A GAY FRIEND  OR RELATIVE OR YOU WANT TO LEAVE  THAT CHOICE OPEN TO YOURSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP  THE GAYS, OSTRACIZE THEM AT  WORK, MOCK THEM AT SCHOOL. MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NO  PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE ACCORDING TO PAUL  CLEMENT, WE CAN'T GIVE THEM  RIGHTS UNTIL WE WRONG THEM. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
