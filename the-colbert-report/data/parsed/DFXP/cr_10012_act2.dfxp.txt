Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, NATION, I DON'T TRUST VEGETABLES. YOU ALWAYS SEE THEM GROWING BUT YOU NEVER SEE THEM EAT. WHAT'S UP. SO WHEN I CARVE PUMPKINS IT'S NOT FOR HALLOWEEN, IT'S A WARNING. THIS IS WHAT I DO TO YOU. AND THIS VEGE-TERROR IS ONLY GETTING WORSE BECAUSE THERE A NEW CROP OUT OF ENGLAND AND IT MIGHT BE THE CRAZIEST [BLEEP] THING I'VE EVER HEARD.
WARNING, FOLKS, WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE MAY CAUSE YOU TO BURGLARIZE YOUR PANTS. JIM.
IT'S A PLANT WHICH PRODUCES BOTH TOMATOES AND POTATO.
ABOVE THE GROUND YOU CAN HARVEST UP TO 500 CHEREE SIZED TOMATOES BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. BELOW THE GROUND YOU CAN HARVEST YOUR OWN CROP OF DELICIOUS WHITE POTATOES.
Stephen: THAT'S UNNATURAL. THE ONLY TIME TOMATOES AND POTATO SHOULD MEET IS AT THE BOTTOM OF A STYROFOAM CLAM SHELL. BESIDES IT'S DISGUSTING. WITHOUT WOULD WANT A POTATO THAT COMES OUT OF THE GROUND, IT'S FILTHY. AND VEGETABLES SHOULD NOT BE MATING WITH OTHER SPECIES. THIS IS MIS-VEG NATION, IT'S ADAM AND EVE, NOT ADAM AND ENDIVE. AND JUST LISTEN, LISTEN HOW THESE MAD BOT ANNISES CREATED THEIR VEGETABLE MEDLEY.
THE INVENTOR PLANT IS BEING CREATED USING A GRAFTING PROCESS, BY TAPING THE ENDS OF TWO PLANTSING TO. IT WORKED IN THIS CASE BECAUSE TOMATOES ARE MEMBERS OF THE POTATO FAMILY, SO THEY ARE NATURALLY COMPATIBLE.
TOMATO AND POTATO PLANTS TAPED END-TO-END. THROW A TURN I IN THERE AND YOU CAN STITCH TOGETHER THE VEGETABLE CENTIPEDE. AND THE NAME, WAIT A SECOND, TOM-TATO, WHERE DID THEY GET THAT NAME, IT'S HALF POTATO AND HALF TOMATO, IT SHOULD BE CALLED THE POTE-AT THAT TIMEO. WHATEVER, YOU SAY POTATO A SAY TOE MATHO.
YOU SAY TOMORROW-TOM TATO. THAT'S THE CRAZIEST [BLEEP] THING I'VE EVER HEARD.
