Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT SAYS OUR HABITS CONTROL OUR BEHAVIOR. HERE'S THE PART WHERE I RUN OVER THERE. PLEASE WELCOME CHARLES DUHIGG. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: HEY, CHARLES, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. NICE TO MEET YOU. YOU'RE THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR, YOU WRITE FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES." YOU'RE A BUSINESS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER BUT YOU ALSO GOT THIS BOOK CALLED "THE POWER OF HABIT: WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO IN LIFE AND IN BUSINESS." IT'S OUT IN PAPERBACK NOW. 62 WEEKS ON THE BEST-SELLER LIST. DID PEOPLE STILL WANT TO BUY IT OR IS IT JUST A FORCE OF HABIT AT THIS POINT?
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTE HABIT.
Stephen: WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT. WE'LL JUST KEEP GOING. THE KEY INSIGHT IS THAT EVERY HABIT HAS THREE PARTS, THERE'S A CUE, WHICH IS LIKE A TRIGGER FOR A BEHAVIOR TO START. THEN THE BEHAVIOR ITSELF, THEN FINALLY A REWARD.
Stephen: GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE --
SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU BACK YOUR CAR OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY YOU'RE PROBABLY ABLE TO THINK ABOUT OTHER THINGS.
Stephen: YEAH I JUST CLOSE MY EYES AND GUN IT.
(LAUGHS) THAT'S BECAUSE SOME PART OF YOUR BRAIN IS ANTICIPATING THE SENSE OF RELIEF YOU'LL HAVE WHEN YOUR CAR ACTUALLY MAKES IT INTO THE STREET.
Stephen: OH!
AND EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF THAT, THAT DEVELOPS A NEUROLOGICAL HABIT THAT YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. CLOSE YOUR EYES OR THINK ABOUT CHANGING THE RADIO STATION OR TALK TO YOUR KIDS. HABITS --
Stephen: SO I GET A, LIKE A  PLEASURE RESPONSE WHEN I'VE ACHIEVED THIS TASK?
ABSOLUTELY. AND YOU ANTICIPATE THAT TASK. THERE WAS A STUDY THAT WAS DONE THAT SAID ABOUT 40% TO 45% OF EVERYTHING WE DO EVERYDAY IS A HABIT. YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN BE AWARE OF MOST OF THEM.
Stephen: BUT THOSE KIND OF HABITS, WHY WE DO SOMETHING TO GET THE PLEASURE RESPONSE  ISN'T THAT LIKE AN ADDICTION? DON'T YOU NEED A HIGHER AND HIGHER DOSE EVERY TIME?
(LAUGHS).
Stephen: SHOULDN'T I GET A LONGER AND LONGER DRIVEWAY? (LAUGHTER)
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: OR BACK OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY ON HEROIN?
THAT MIGHT DO THE TRICK.
Stephen: SO 40% TO 45% OF WHAT THE AVERAGE PERSON DOES IN A DAY IS JUST OUT OF HABIT, WE'RE NOT REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING?
AND THIS IS AMAZING BECAUSE IT LETS YOUR BRAIN -- EVOLUTIONARILY THIS HAS ALLOWED US TO SUCCEED, AND EVERY OTHER ANIMAL. OUR BRAIN CAN TAKE PATTERNS AND MAKE THEM AUTOMATIC WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TIME TO INVENT FIRE OR SPEARS OR VIDEO GAMES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE THREE.
ABSOLUTELY. IF YOU DIDN'T FORM HABITS WE WOULD BE IN TROUBLE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THE TROUBLE IS OFTEN TIMES YOUR BRAIN IS BAD AT CHOOSING HABITS. YOU LIKE TO EAT DOUGHNUTS OR YOU LIKE TO EAT COOKIES HABITUALLY.
Stephen: THEY'RE FANTASTIC, COOKIES ARE WONDERFUL.
THEY ARE. UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT. AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN WE TRY AND STRUCTURE OUR BRAIN IN CERTAIN WAYS SO THAT WE DON'T DEVELOP BAD HABITS, WE TEND NOT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THESE CUES AND THESE REWARDS. THIS IS THE REAL INSIGHT IS THAT IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S TRIGGERING THE BEHAVIOR AND WHAT REWARD IT'S DELIVERING TO YOU THEN YOU GET THIS CONTROL OVER SHAPING THAT HABIT.
Stephen: BUT WHAT'S TRIGGERING MY BEHAVIOR WITH  A COOKIE IS THAT COOKIES ARE FANTASTIC.
(LAUGHS).
Stephen: RIGHT? THEY'RE DELICIOUS.
I HAD A COOKIE HABIT MYSELF AND I'D CALL THESE FANCY PSYCHOLOGISTS AND AT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION I'D SAY "I HAVE A FRIEND WITH A BAD COOKIE HABIT." AND WHAT THEY SAID IS "WHAT'S THE REWARD?" AND I SAID WELL, THE REWARD'S A COOKIE. AND THEY SAID "NO, REWARDS ARE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED LIKE THAT. A COOKIE IS LIKE 12 OR 13 REWARDS IN A TASTY LITTLE  BUNDLE."
Stephen: OH, YEAH, BECAUSE OATMEAL CHOCOLATE CHIP, IT'S STILL WARM AND GOOEY AND THE MILK IF YOU KEEP THE REFRIGERATOR REALLY LOW, THAT SPIKE OF FRESH COLD AROUND THE COOKIE. DO YOU WANT A COOKIE RIGHT NOW?
I KIND OF DO WANT A COOKIE RIGHT NOW. SO THINK ABOUT IT, ARE YOU EATING THE COOKIE BECAUSE YOU'RE HUNGRY? IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD HAVE AN APPLE WHICH WOULD WORK JUST AS WELL. OR BECAUSE YOU NEED A--
Stephen: SHUT UP!
(LAUGHS).
Stephen: SHUT UP!
SORRY!
Stephen: YOU SEEM LIKE A LOT OF FUN. "HERE KIDS, HAPPY HALLOWEEN. HERE'S YOUR APPLE!"
(LAUGHS) OR MAYBE YOU NEED A BURST OF ENERGY AND THE SUGAR GIVES YOU THE ENERGY, WHICH MEANS YOU COULD HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE. THAT WOULD DO JUST AS WELL AND YOU CAN REPLACE THAT COOKIE HABIT WITH A COFFEE HABIT. OR IN MY CASE IT TURNED OUT WHEN I WAS GOING UP TO THE CAFETERIA TO GET A COOKIE EVERY AFTERNOON, THAT'S WHEN I SAW MY FRIENDS  FROM THE "NEW YORK TIMES" AND WE WOULD TALK AND GOSSIP. THE SOCIALIZATION WAS THE REWARD DRIVING THE HABIT.
Stephen: SO YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT WAS WHAT WAS DRIVING YOU
I HAD NO IDEA.
Stephen: I DON'T LIKE THIS THEORY AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'M SURE IT'S A GREAT BOOK AND EVERYONE SHOULD BUY IT, BUT HERE'S WHAT I DON'T BUY ABOUT IT, IS THAT EVERY MOMENT OF MY LIFE IS A MOMENT OF CLARITY AND CHOICE, OK? [LAUGHTER] I'M NOT ONE OF THE MINDLESS JELLYFISH BEING PULLED ALONG IN THE TIDE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS. I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. I SAY TO MY HEART "CONTINUE BEATING." (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW? EVERY MOMENT OF MY LIFE IS A CHOICE BECAUSE GOD GAVE ME FREE WILL. IT SOUNDS LIKE ANTI-FREE WILL. THERE'S SORT OF A DETERMINIST NATURE TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
YOU'RE AN EXCEPTIONAL HUMAN BEING. UNFORTUNATELY, THE REST OF US HAVE TO LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT. IS IT -- THESE HABITS, THEY'RE GOOD HABITS AND BAD HABIT, RIGHT?
ABSOLUTELY. AND YOU DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE GOOD OR BAD. TO YOUR BRAIN THEY ALL SEEM THE SAME. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A WAY TO SAVE ENERGY. I KNOW I LIKE THIS THING, I KNOW THERE'S THE TRIGGER FOR IT I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE IT AN AUTOMATIC PATTERN.
Stephen: IS THERE AN EVOLUTIONARY COMPONENT TO THIS?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: THEN WHY DO WE HAVE ANY PATTERNS OR HABITS THAT OUR -- THAT ARE BAD FOR US? WHY DIDN'T WE JUST EVOLVE TO ONLY LIKE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR US?
WELL, IT'S INTERESTING, RIGHT? BECAUSE TAKE COOKIES, FOR INSTANCE. COOKIES ARE GOOD FOR US IN A LOT OF WAYS, RIGHT?
Stephen: YES, THEY MAKE US HAPPY.
THEY MAKE US HAPPY. IN A STATE OF NATURE THEY WOULD GIVE US CALORIES AND ENERGY. FOR ME IT'S A TOOL FOR SOCIALIZING WITH MY FRIENDS.
Stephen: AGAIN, I DON'T BUY THAT, BUT GO AHEAD. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE -- THAT'S LIKE A REALLY GREAT JUSTIFICATION TO STAY ON YOUR DIET. "WHAT I REALLY WANT IS FRIENDS. FRIENDS WITH CHOCOLATE CHIPS." WELL, CHARLES, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: CHARLES DUHIGG, "THE POWER OF HABIT." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
