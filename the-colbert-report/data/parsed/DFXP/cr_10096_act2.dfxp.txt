Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY SECRET OUT THERE THAT I AM TOUGH ON CRIME. BUT OUR CRIMINAL-CODDLING PRESIDENT DOES NOT SHARE MY TASTE FOR UNYIELDING JUSTICE. ( LAUGHTER ) HIS LATEST MOVE MAKES MEANTIME TO TURN IN MY BADGE IT THAT I MADE FOR MYSELF. JIM.
THOUSANDS OF CONVICTED DRUG OFFENDERS COULD BE WALKING FREE SOON THANKS TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S SWEEPING NEW PLAN FOR CLEMENCY.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FORMALLY ANNOUNCED THE NEW CRITERIA TODAY AS PART OF AN EFFORT TO SHRINK THE PRISON POPULATION. DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL JAMES COLE SAID IT'S AIMED PRIMARILY AT DRUG OFFENDERS GIVEN HARSH PENALTIES UNDER OLD SENTENCING GUIDELINES.
THE PRESIDENT COULD GRANT CLEMENCY TO "HUNDREDS PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE."
Stephen:  "HUNDREDS, PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE?" THAT'S LIKE EMPTYING THREE PRISON CELLS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHY ARE WE BEING SUBJECTED TO THIS JAILHOUSE CROCK? IT'S ALL-- ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S ALL PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO ROLL BACK LONG-MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES METED OUT AFTER THE CRACK-FUELED CRIME WAVE OF THE 80s. OH, GREAT! NOW THESE 80s THUGS WILL BE OUT ON THE STREET IN THEIR ONE-STRAP OVERALLS SEEKING REVENGE AGAINST McGRUFF THE CRIME DOG. YOU KNOW THIS IS A BAD IDEA, FOLKS, BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT IT FROM THE ONLY PEOPLE LESS TRUSTED THAN CONVICTS -- CONGRESS. YOU SEE, BACK IN 2010 CONGRESS PASSES THE SO-CALLED FAIR SENTENCING ACT TO REDUCE THE 100-1 DISPARITY FOR SENTENCES FOR CRACK COCAINE AND THOSE FOR POWDERED COCAINE. HUGE MISTAKE, FOLKS. THEY MAY BE THE SAME DRUG BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT CRACK OFFENDERS THAT JUST MADE THEM SEEM MORE... CONVICTABLE. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMEWHERE ON THEIR I DON'T KNOW WHAT. WE ALL KNOW THERE'S A SINISTER MOTIVE BEHIND APPLYING THE LAW EQUALLY.
MORE "GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" CARDS FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA. IS IT COMPASSION OR CLEVER POLITICS?
HE'S AWARE MIDTERMS ARE COMING UP AND IT'S A WAY TO AMP UP HIS BASE.
BECAUSE IT'S 2014 MY POLITICAL MIND STARTS TO WONDER, WHY ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THIS NOW? AGAIN, IS THIS A NATIONAL PRIORITY? I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK IT'S ALL TO RALLY THE --
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT, OBAMA IS CLEARLY RALLYING THE LIBERAL BASE BY RELEASING DRUG DEALERS. IT'S TOTALLY UNFAIR. REPUBLICANS CAN'T RALLY THEIR SUPPORTERS THAT WAY. THERE ARE NO BANKERS IN JAIL TO RELEASE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND-- A LOT OF BANKER FANS HERE TONIGHT, TOO. ( LAUGHTER ) AND BREAK OUT THE VEGAN CHAMPAGNE, LEFTIES. BECAUSE IT COULDN'T BE EASIER FOR THESE HOODLUMS TO GET OUT.
CONVICTS MUST BE SERVING A SENTENCE UNDER OLD LAW THAT IS GREATER THAN REQUIRED UNDER CURRENT LAW. CONVICTED OF NONVIOLENT CRIMES WITHOUT LINKS TO ORGANIZED CRIME. HAVE SERVED AT LEAST 10 YEARS. HAVE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL HISTORY. GOOD PRISON RECORDS AND NO HISTORY OF VIOLENCE.
Stephen:  OH, SURE, THEY MAY NOT HAVE A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE BUT WHAT ABOUT A FUTURE OF VIOLENCE? BECAUSE IF I'D BEEN THROWN IN JAIL FOR POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA THEN GOT OUT 10 YEARS LATER AND FOUND OUT POT IS LEGAL NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M PRETTY SURE I'D SHOOT
