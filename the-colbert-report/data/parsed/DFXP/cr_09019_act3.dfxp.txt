WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  TONIGHT BELONGS TO "THE NEW  YORK TIMES". AND THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO  TELL YOU SO YOU GET PAST THE  PAY WALL. PLEASE WELCOME NATE SILVER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NATE, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,  SIT DOWN. ALL RIGHT, NATE, WELCOME  BACK.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: LAST NAME YOU  WERE HERE FOUR YEARS AGO,  OKAY, BEFORE THE LAST SECTION, YOU'RE WELCOME,  GAVE YOU THE COLBERT BUMP,  NOW YOU GOT A JOB, WHERE DO YOU WORK NOW.
I WORK AT THE "NEW YORK  TIMES" NOW.
Stephen: NICE PLACE TO  WORK.
IT'S A NICE PLACE. NICE BUILDING, YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT,  SO THE NICE TEES ARE ASIDE. OKAY, GLOVES ARE COMING OFF. YOU HAVE GOT A BOOK CALLED  "THE SIGNAL AND THE NOISE,  WHY SO MANY PREDICTIONS FAIL BUT SOME DON'T"  LET ME GUESS.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOURS DON'T. (LAUGHTER)  I'M STABBING THE DARK ON  THAT ONE.
THEY COULD BUT WE'LL TELL  YOU HOW LIKELY THEY ARE TO  FAIL IS SO WE HAVE KIND OF TRUTH IN ADVERTISING.
Stephen: OKAY, BUT HERE'S  MY PROBLEM WITH WHAT YOU ARE  DOING. IS THAT YOU ARE TAKING BREAD  OUT OF MY KID'S MOUTH. BECAUSE I AM A PUNDIT, OKAY. THOSE OF US IN THE PUNDITOCRACY  MAKE OUR BREAD AND BUTTER BY  TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THE TRUTH IS AS WE SEE IT FROM  OUR GUT.
YEAH.
Stephen: RIGHT.
YEAH.
Stephen: YEAH. ARE YOU TRYING TO PUT THE  PUNDIT OUT OF WORK BECAUSE  CNN DOESN'T NEED ANY MORE  HELP.
OH, I THINK IT SHOULD  BE--   (APPLAUSE)
I'M JUST TRYING TO  EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE THAT THE  PUNDITS CAN BE VERY  ENTERTAINING BUT IT'S NOT REALLY-- .
Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR  OPINION OF THE PUNDITS,  SHOOT FROM THE HIP.
I'M NOT A BIG-- I'M NOT  VERY PRO PUNDIT, I HAVE TO  SAY. I WOULD VOTE AGAINST-- .
Stephen: COME ON, PUT  YOUR BALLS ON THE FELT, HOW  DO YOU FEEL ABOUT PUNDITS.
IF PUNDITS WERE ON THE  BALLOT AGAINST LIKE, I DON'T  KNOW, E BOLLA I MIGHT VOTE  EBOLA. OR THIRD PARTY.
Stephen: THIRD PARTY, YOU  WRITE IN BLACK PLAGUE. NOW MY BUDDY JOE SCARBOROUGH,  JOE MORNING AND SCARBOROUGH,  HE-- YOU BET HIM 1,000 THAT YOUR PREDICTIVE MODEL WAS  CORRECT. $1,000 THAT WOULD GO TO RED  CROSS.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: HE DIDN'T TAKE  THE BET.
HE DIDN'T TAKE THE BET. MAYBE IT -- LOOK, I USED TO  PLAY POKER AND IN MY WORLD,  IT SHOWS YOU HAVE INTEGRITY TO BE PUTTING YOUR MONEY  BEHIND AN IDEA THAT YOU HAVE,  IT MEANS ARE YOU BEING  SERIOUS AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE INCENTIVE TO BE  ACCURATEMENT ARE YOU NOT  JUST TANNING THERE BLOWING  HOT AIR, POTENTIALLY.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
AND JOE TO HIS CREDIT DID  DONATE, MAKE A DONATION ON  MY BEHALF AND I DONATED AS WELL SO IT WOUND UP BEING  FOR A GOOD CAUSE BUT I THINK  A LOT OF PEOPLE GET ON TV AND SAY THINGS THEY DON'T  REALLY HAVE ANY CONVICTION  BEHIND THEM T BECOMES A GAME JUST TO ENTERTAIN PAST THE  AUDIENCE, HALF THE AUDIENCE  OR THE OTHER HALF OF THE AUDIENCE OR WHATEVER ELSE,  RIGHT. AND WE'RE TRYING TO SAY  SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE WHICH  IS THAT, HEY, GO AND LOOK AT THE POLLS. AND TAKE AN AVERAGE. AND THEN ADD UP THE STATES  AND SEE WHO HAS 27 O-- 270  ELECTORAL VOTES IT IS NOT THAT COMPLICATED IT IS NOT  LIKE GALILEO OR SOMETHING,  SOMETHING TOTALLY  THEORETICAL. NO, LOOK, THESE POLLS ARE  PRETTY SIMPLE LITTLE FACTS,  RIGHT. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT  ARE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED  THAN LOOKING AT THE POLLS  AND TAKING AN AVERAGE, RIGHT, AND COULDN'TING TO 270,  RIGHT.
Stephen: THAT IS THE  LONGEST POSSIBLE WAY OF  CALLING HIM A BULL [BLEEP] (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT HERE'S THE THING, DOW  BELIEVE IN YOUR PHYSICAL  ANALYSIS OBVIOUSLY.
YEAH.
Stephen: BUT EVERYBODY  DOES. THE RASMUSSEN BELIEVE IN  THEIRS, AND GALLOP BELIEVES  IN THEIR. AND TTT AND RASMUSSEN GOES  RIGHT AND TPT GOES LEFT BUT  ARE YOU THE ONLY HONEST MAN IN AMERICA.
NO, I'M NOT THE ONLY BUT  I THINK-- .
Stephen: THEY SAY THEY  ARE NOT RIGHT AND ARE YOU.
THE BAR IS LOW, MAN.
Stephen: RAZOR TIGHT WHAT  PART OF RAZOR TIGHT DON'T  YOU GET?
LIKE THERE ARE 23 STATE  POLLS AND OBAMA WAS AHEAD IN  22 OF THEM IT IS NOT A COIN TOSS AT THAT POINT. IT'S CLOSE, BUT YOU HAVE TO  HAVE A CASE WHERE THE POLLS  ARE OFF ACROSS-THE-BOARD. IT COULD HAPPEN. BUT IF ANYTHING THE RACE HAS  BROKEN TOWARD PRESIDENT  OBAMA A BIT IN THE LAST 48 HOURS OR SO.
Stephen: DO YOU, WE'LL  EDIT THAT OUT. DO YOU-- IF THE RACE HAS  BROKEN TOWARD OBAMA, OKAY,  HE'S ALWAYS BEEN AHEAD IN  YOUR POLL, RIGHT.
HE'S BEEN AHEAD IN THE  FORECAST, YEAH.
Stephen: IN YOUR FORECAST,  SORRY IN YOUR FORECAST. SO I MEAN 86 WHAT IS THE  PERCENTAGE RIGHT NOW.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO GO  ABOVE, IT'S ACTUALLY RUNNING,  THE MODEL IN THE GREEN ROOM.
Stephen: SO IF I THREW A  BUCKET OF WATER ON IT OBAMA  WOULD LOSE? NATE SILVER, THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR JOINING ME. NATE SILVER, THE SIGNAL AND  THE NOISE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  GOOD LUCK.
