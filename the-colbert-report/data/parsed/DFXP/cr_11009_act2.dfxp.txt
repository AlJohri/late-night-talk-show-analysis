STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! FOLKS, THERE ARE SO MANY IMPORTANT STORIES OUT THERE RIGHT NOW -- I.S.I.S., UKRAINE, EBOLA. TONIGHT WE EXPLORE THE MOST CRITICAL STORY OF ALL -- ME. BACK IN 2005 WHEN I STARTED "THE COLBERT REPORT," IT WAS FOR AN INITIALLY FOR AN EIGHT-WEEK TRYOUT. IN OTHER WORDS, 32 EPISODES. AND AS OF TONIGHT, THERE ARE ONLY 32 EPISODES OF THE "THE COLBERT REPORT" LEFT. (AUDIENCE AWWW'S) DON'T WORRY, NATION. EVEN THOUGH MY SHOW WILL BE OFF THE AIR, I'LL STILL BE IN HERE PROVIDED YOUR HEART HAS A D.V.R. (LAUGHTER) THERE'S JUST NOTHING LEFT FOR ME TO ACCOMPLISH. I PROMISED I WOULD CHANGE THE WORLD, AND I DID -- AFTER ALL, IN 2005 YOU DIDN'T HAVE IGGY AZELIA, SNAPCHAT OR AMERICONE DREAM ICE CREAM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I FREED YOU FROM THE TYRANNY OF HAVING TO FUDGE-COAT YOUR OWN CHUNKS OF WAFFLECONE. THAT SAVES TIME. TIME YOU CAN SPEND WITH YOUR FAMILY. MM-MMM! EVEN THE LID TASTES GOOD. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, I MAY BE LEAVING, BUT THE ICE CREAM IS GOING TO STAY. YET ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN KEEP ME IN HERE. 'CUZ THIS IS GONNA GUM UP YOUR AORTA. (LAUGHTER) AND I GUARANTEE THAT EACH OF THE REMAINING EPISODES WILL BECOME INSTANT CLASSICS, TREASURED BY GENERATIONS FOR THEIR DEEP, POETIC THOUGHTS, HEAVY-HANDED SYMBOLISM, AND MASSIVE FORESHADOWING. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GRIMMY? (LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE REACTS) HMM... WHAT COULD THAT MEAN? (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE BY FIRE, YOU'RE POINTING AT AN HOURGLASS -- OOH, STITCH IN TIME SAVES NINE! (LAUGHTER) YOU LIKE MY PAINTING, AND  YOUR NECK IS ITCHY. (LAUGHTER) SKULL AND CROSSBONES... THEY'RE MAKING "PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 32!" (APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, THE BIGGEST QUESTION OF ALL REMAINS, HOW WILL MY FINAL BROADCAST CLOSE? WILL I WAKE UP NEXT TO SUZANNE PLESHETTE IN A SNOW GLOBE AFTER RACHEL GETS OFF THE PLANE TO BE WITH ME WHILE B.J. HONEYCUTT WRITES OUT GOODBYE IN ROCKS, UNTIL WE CUT TO BLACK IN THE MIDDLE OF A JOURNEY SONG? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OR WILL I JUST GET SUED FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT? TUNE IN TO FIND OUT! BUT REST ASSURED, NATION, UP UNTIL THE VERY END, I WILL MAINTAIN MY JOURNALISTIC STANDARDS BY BRINGING YOU MY TAKE ON THE STORIES THAT MATTER TO YOU. SO LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO THE BREAKING NEWS OUT OF SOUTH KOREA. A CHIHUAHUA IS READING A MAGAZINE WHILE GETTING A NECK MASSAGE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ YO QUIERO PEABODY AWARD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
