WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,  THANKS, FOLKS. NATION, THE NETWORK HAS  INFORMED ME TIME AND AGAIN  OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 18  TO 34-YEAR-OLD DEMOGRAPHIC. SO I FIGURE APPEALING TO THE  68 TO 94-YEAR-OLD MUST BE  THREE TIMES AS IMPORTANT. SO EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I  LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO  ADDRESS OLDER VIEWERS  PERSONALLY. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S  SENIOR MOMENT. NATION, AS YOU AGE YOU START  TO FACE SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS  LIKE WHY IS IT SO COLD IN  HERE. OR WHO IS TWITTER. AND WHY DOESN'T THAT  COLOURED NURSE LIKE IT WHEN  I CALL HER THAT COLOURED  NURSE. BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING YOU  WONDER WHERE YOU'LL SPEND  YOUR GOLDEN YEARS, NURSING HOMES CAN BE ISOLATING AND  CATHERINE ZETA-JONES CAN  ONLY MARRY ONE OLD MAN AT A  TIME. NOW SURE, YOUR ADULT  CHILDREN COULD TAKE YOU IN  BUT IF YOU LIVED IN THE  BASEMENT WHERE WOULD THEY PUT THE BUMPER POOL TABLE. THE GRANDKIDS NEED THAT TO  THROW THEIR WET COATS ON. LUCKILY THE SOLUTION COULD  BE AS CLOSE AS THE VERY LAWN  YOU YELL AT KIDS TO KEEP  OFF.
WE'RE CHECKING OUT A  BUSINESS THAT MAKES GRANGE  PODS THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE CALLING THEM, LONG-TERM CARE  HOUSING OPTIONS FOR THE  ELDERLY. THEY'RE PORTABLE. THEY CAN BE SET UP RIGHT ON  YOUR PROPERTY N YOUR  BACKYARD IF YOU WANT. THE UNITS ARE SPECIFICALLY  DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS  OF YOUR LOVED ONES AND ARE AN OPTION SOME SAY TO  CHOOSING OVER NURSING HOMES.
Stephen: YES, A GRAHNEE  POD. WHY SPEND TIME IN A COLD,  STERILE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT  FAR FROM YOUR FAMILY WHEN YOU COULD BE IN A COLD,  STERILE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT  WITHIN SIGHT OF YOUR FAMILY. IN YOUR VERY OWN MEDICAL  GRADE SHED. FOR JUST $85 TO $125,000,  GRAHNEE PODS OFFER A COZY 12  BY 24 FEET, ALMOST ONE/8th OF A VOLLEYBALL COURT. SURE IT'S SMALL BUT THINK  HOW OFTEN YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER  WILL VISIT ONCE SHE SEES YOU LIVING IN A DOLL HOUSE. AND YOU WON'T NEED A LIVE-IN  NURSE BECAUSE THE GRAHNEE  POD IS PACKED WITH THE ONE THING HELDER-- ELDERLY  PEOPLE LOVE MOST,  TECHNOLOGY.
WE PUT AN AUTOMATIC  DISPENSER THAT IN TURN THE  CAREGIVER CAN PULL UP ON THEIR iPAD AND THEY CAN SEE  WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE TAKEN  THEIR MEDICATION.
NOW YOUR FAMILY CAN CHECK  YOUR MEDS FROM THEIR iPAD. IT IS MEDICAL CARE WITH ALL  THE BEDSIDE MANNER OF AN  AUTOMATIC CAT FEEDER. (LAUGHTER)  NOW I'M AWARE, I'M AWARE,  FOLKS, NOT EVERYBODY HAS THE  BACKYARD SPACE FOR A GRAHNEE  POD. THAT IS WHY TONIGHT I'M  PROUD TO INTRODUCE MY NEW  PRODUCT FOR BUDGET CONSCIOUS  GOLDEN AGE LIVING STEPHEN COLBERT'S PEEPAW CRATE.
