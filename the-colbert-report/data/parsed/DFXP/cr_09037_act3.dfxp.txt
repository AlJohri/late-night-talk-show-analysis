[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT PLAYS A  TERRORIST HUNTER ON SHOWTIME'S  HIT SERIES "HOMELAND."  I'LL ASK HIM NOT TO SPOIL THE FINALE OF "SEINFELD"--  I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT EITHER! PLEASE WELCOME MANDY PANTIKIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MANDY, SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU.
STEPHEN: I'M AN ENORMOUS  FAN. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
STEPHEN: STAGE SCREEN, TONY  WINNER, EMMY WINNER YOU ARE A  LEGEND IN YOUR OWN BEARD. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S TALK ABOUT SAUL FOR A  SECOND. YOU ARE ON THE HOTTEST SHOW  RIGHT NOW "HOMELAND."  YOU ARE ONE OF THE STARS YOU  PLAY THE C.I.A. CHIEF NAMED  SAUL. HOW -- DID YOU GROW THE BEARD  FOR THE PART OR DID YOU SAY, I  GOT THE BEARD I'M JUST GOING TO GO WITH IT? IT MAKES YOU LIKE ALMOST LIKE A  BIBLICAL PROPHET?
I WAS DOING A PLAY AT THE  TIME CALLED "COMPULSION" AND I  GOT THE CALL ON MY BIRTHDAY NOVEMBER 30, 2010 FROM MY AGENT. THEY SAID THEY WANTED ME TO DO  THIS. ALEX CALLED AND SAID WOULD YOU  GROW A BEARD. I DIDN'T HAVE A BEARD FOR THE  MY. I GREW IT FOR THE PILOT AND I  IMMEDIATELY SHAVED IT OFF AND  GREW IT BACK FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST SEASON.
STEPHEN: HOW MANY HOURS DID  IT TAKE YOU TO GROW THAT BEARD?
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. IT TAKES MEEL-10 WEEKS TO GET IT  UP TO SPEED.
STEPHEN: REALLY? REALLY?
YEAH.
STEPHEN: DO YOU TRY SPIKES  TO JUICE IT AT ALL?
JOB SPIKES.
STEPHEN: MIRACLE GROW?
MIRACLE GROW, JOB SPIKES. [ LAUGHTER ]
STEPHEN: OKAY. NOW, YOU'RE BURSTING, THIS  CHARACTER IS LIKE THIS LOW KEY  SIMMERING IF YOU AREY TO HIM. BUT YOU ARE BURSTING WITH  THEATRICAL ENERGY. I'VE SEEN YOU PERFORM. WHEN ESTES IS LEANING ON YOU  TRYING TO GET YOU TO DROP  SOMETHING YOU ARE SNIFFING OUT DO YOU WANT TO SAY DON'T TELL ME  HOW TO LIVE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK -- I THINK.
STEPHEN: YOU THINK THAT ALL  THE TIME.
I DO. TO BE HONEST I DO.
STEPHEN: BEING IN THE SHOW  ARE YOU LESS OR MORE FRIGHTENED  ABOUT TERRORISM? DOES IT CALM YOU DONE OR KEY YOU  UP?
I'M NOT FRIGHTENED TERRORISM.
STEPHEN: YOU ARE NOT? IF YOU ARE NOT FRIGHTENED ABOUT  TERRORISM, THEN AREN'T YOU THE  PROBLEM? BECAUSE YOU'RE LULLING -- IF  YOUR EXAMPLE IS NOT TO BE  FRIGHTENED AREN'T YOU LULLING THE REST OF US INTO A FALSE  SENSE OF SECURITY AND THE  TERRORIST HAVE WON? I'M FRIGHTENED ABOUT THE ROOTS  WE CALL TERRORISM.
STEPHEN: LET'S BLAME  AMERICA LET'S HEAR IT.
I DO BLAME AMERICA PARTIALLY  AND I BLAME THE OTHER SIDE  EQUALLY. ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID BEFORE  WE SHOT THE FIRST SEN OF THE  PILOT WAS HERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TO MAKE A  DOCUMENT RIX WE'RE MAKING A  DOCUMENTARY ABOUT RIGHT WING AMERICA AND WE ASKED STEPHEN  COLBERT TO BE INTERVIEW AND HE  WASN'T AVAILABLE.
STEPHEN: WHICH I WOULD NOT  BE.
VERY GOOD. IN A DRAMA THAT HAPPENS IN  SHAKESPEARE PLAYS OR IN HOMELAND  YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT BOTH SIDES OF AN OPINION  EQUALLY AND LEAVE IT TO THE  AUDIENCE TO LISTEN AND MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS.
STEPHEN: THAT IS CALLED  PROPAGANDA. IF YOU GIVE A MOMENT'S HUMANITY  TO YOUR ENEMY, THEN HE WINS.
WHAT CREATES AN ENEMY?
STEPHEN: AN ATTACK.
AND WHY IS AN A-- ATTACK  TAKING PLACE? ARE YOU NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR  ANYTHING THAT GOES ON ANYWHERE  ELSE IN THE WORLD? YOU HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY  WHATSOEVER?
STEPHEN: NO.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU BELIEVE  THAT.
STEPHEN: IT'S CALLED  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY MANDY  PATINKIN, HAVE YOU HEARD OF  THAT?
YES.
STEPHEN: THEY HATE US FOR  OUR FREEDOM.
THINK ABOUT YOURSELF.
STEPHEN: I THINK ABOUT  MYSELF ALL THE TIME. I THINK ABOUT ME RIGHT NOW.
DO YOU HAVE KIDS?
STEPHEN: WHO IS ASKING.
I'M ASKING.
STEPHEN: YES, I HAVE  CHILDREN.
DO YOU THINK ABOUT THEM ON  OCCASION?
STEPHEN: DO YOU THINK ABOUT  YOUR SPHWHIEF.
STEPHEN: I DO THINK ABOUT  MY WIFE.
YOU DON'T JUST THINK ABOUT  YOURSELF.
STEPHEN: THEY ARE PART OF  ME. I THINK ABOUT AMERICA, TOO.
I DO, TOO, I LOVE THIS  COUNTRY.
STEPHEN: DO YOU?
YES.
STEPHEN: WOULD YOU HAVE  BEGUN TO WAR AGAINST SADDAM  HUSSEIN?
NO, SIR.
STEPHEN: OKAY. SO THAT'S FINE YOU WITH SADDAM  HUSSEIN PUT HIM BACK IN MANDY  PATINKIN 2012? YOU SAID THAT. YOUR WORDS.
YOU WOULD NOT GO WAR AGAINST  SADDAM HUSSEIN.
Stephen: WOULD YOU GO TO  WAR AGAINST ANYBODY?
WITH WORDS, NOT WEAPONS. I WOULD EXHAUST MYSELF -- I  WOULD DIE TALKING BEFORE I  LIFTED A WEAPON. I THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER TO THE  PEACE UNTIL THE MIDDLE EAST. PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ISN'T  GOING TO BE CREATED BY ANOTHER  WAR OR VIOLENT ACT ON EITHER  SIDE. IT'S GOING TO BE CREATED BY  SOMEONE LIKE YOURSELF AND  SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO SIT IN A ROOM WORK TO INDIVIDUALS WHO  HAVE A BELIEF AND WHO CAN TALK  TO A GROUP OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND GET PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR  MINDS. IT'S NOT A MAGIC TRICK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
STEPHEN: YOU'VE CONVINCED  ME BUT ONLY BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT  WAS SAUL TALKING FOR A SECOND. THERE DON'T THINK YOU WON MANDY  PATINKIN. SAUL WON THAT ONE.
I THINK THAT THE BEST WAY TO  GO THROUGH LIFE AND I'VE SAID  THIS TO THE WRITERS OF HOMELAND IS I WOULD LICK TO HIRE ONE  WRITER OR TWO AND HAVE THEM  WRITE MY ENTIRE LIFE.
STEPHEN: IT'S PRETTY NICE. [ LAUGHTER ] [  APPLAUSE  ] MANDY, THANK YOU SO
