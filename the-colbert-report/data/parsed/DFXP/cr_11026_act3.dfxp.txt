Stephen: WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW DOCUMENTARY ABOUT LOW-WAGE FARM WORKERS IN FLORIDA. WHAT A CRUEL LIFE -- THEY HAVE TO LIVE IN FLORIDA. PLEASE WELCOME EVA LONGORIA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WHAT A PLEASURE. I SEE YOU HAVE BROUGHT A VEGETABLE TO HURL AT ME. WHAT HAVE WE HERE?
IT'S A FAIR FOOD TOMATO FROM FLORIDA.
Stephen: OKAY. A FAIR FOOD TOMATO. YOU ARE AN ACTIVIST. YOU WERE NAMED BY THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER AS THE PHILANTHROPIST OF THE YEAR.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY ARE YOU PHILANTHOPING INSTEAD OF SIMPLY CELEBRITY-ING. DOESN'T THIS TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR RED CARPET TIME?
YES, BUT IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE. THE RELEASE OF  A DOCUMENTARY I JUST MADE CALLED "FOOD CHAINS" IS COMING OUT, AND IT'S ABOUT THE EXPLOITATION OF LABOR IN OUR FARMS IN AMERICA.
Stephen: AND YOU PRODUCED THIS?
I PRODUCED THE DOCUMENTARY. I THOUGHT YOU MEANT I PRODUCED THE TOMATO.
Stephen: NO. NO, I PRODUCED THE DOCUMENTARY ABOUT FARM WORKERS. THIS IS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT TOMATOES AND ABOUT FLORIDA.
Stephen: HOW DO I KNOW YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT FARM WORKERS? BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ACTRESS AND, NO OFFENSE, ACTORS AND ACTRESSES GET PAID TO LIE FOR A LIVING.
YEAH.
Stephen: TO LOOK LIKE THEY THEY CARED ABOUT THINGS. I DON'T THINK YOU CARED ABOUT THOSE OTHER WOMEN ON WISTERIA LANE. I REALLY DON'T. BUT WHEN I WATCHED THE SHOW, I WAS SCARED, CRIED. YOUR JOYS WERE MY JOYS YOU KNOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: SO WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT THESE WORKERS? THEY'VE GOT JOBS. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE JOBS. WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO PICK OUR TOMATOES WORK UNDER THAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE CHANGED?
I CARE BECAUSE I EAT FOOD, AND YOU EAT FOOD, WE ALL EAT FOOD AND WE SHOULD REALLY CARE ABOUT WHERE OUR FOOD COMES FROM. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A GREATER INTEREST IN WHAT WE FREE. WE'RE GLUTEN FREE, SOY FREE, LACTOSE FREE, BUT WE DON'T THINK ABOUT THE HUMAN COST BEHIND WHERE OUR FOOD COMES FROM. WHAT WE ARE SHOWING IN THE DOCUMENTARY, IT'S AN AMAZING DOCUMENTARY ABOUT WHAT IS BEING DONE IN FLORIDA WITH TOMATOES SPECIFICALLY, AND IT'S CALLED THE FAIR FOOD PROGRAM. THESE WORKERS FORMED THE COALITION OF IMMOKALEE WORKERS  AND CAME UP WITH AN AMAZING PROGRAM THAT NOT ONLY RAISES WAGES BUT STOPS ABUSE IN THE FIELD, EVERYTHING FROM PHYSICAL ABUSE, SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND DOES AN AUDIT OF COMPLIANCE TO MAKE SURE ALL THE FARMERS ARE APPLYING THIS PARTICULAR FAIR FOOD PROGRAM TO THEIR CROPS AND THEY'RE DOING IT AMAZINGLY WELL.
Stephen: SO THESE WORKERS IN IMMOKALEE, FLORIDA, ARE GETTING PAID -- (APPLAUSE) I THOUGHT I DID PRONOUNCE THAT WELL, IMMOKALEE THEY'RE GETTING 1 PENNY A POUND TO PICK TOMATOES RIGHT NOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE PAID PER POUND?
WHAT THE FAIR FOOD PROGRAM DOES IS ASK CONSUMERS AND THE LARGEST BUYERS OF PRODUCE -- SUPERMARKETS AND FAST-FOOD CHAINS -- TO PAY A PENNY MORE A POUND AND THAT DOUBLES THEIR WAGES.
Stephen: SO 2 PENNIES A POUND.
YEAH, TO 2 PENNIES PER POUND.
Stephen: YOU REALIZE THAT BY SAYING THAT YOU STILL KIND OF SOUND LIKE A MONSTER. ONLY 2 PENNIES A POUND LONGORIA, THEY WOULD CALL YOU.
IT WOULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE BY 44 CENTS A YEAR AND YOU LITERALLY DOUBLE THE WAGES OF THESE FARM WORKERS.
Stephen: YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN SOME PEOPLE INVOLVED YOU'VE GOTTEN McDONALD'S, BURGER KING, SUBWAY, CHIPOTLE, ALL THESE FAST-FOOD CHAINS TO GET ON BOARD WITH THE FAIR FOOD PROGRAM (APPLAUSE) IS THE REAL MESSAGE THAT WE SHOULD BUY LESS FRESH FOOD AND MORE FAST FOOD AS AMERICANS TO HELP THESE PEOPLE?
NO, NO, NO. YOU NEED TO EAT HEALTHY. THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN POINTS  OF THE DOCUMENTARY IS THE C.I.W HAS HAD AMAZING SUCCESS Stephen: WHAT'S THE C.I.W.?
COALITION OF IMMOKALEE WORKERS. IT'S MUCH EASIER, RIGHT? C.I.W. Stephen: CIUWAH AND ANYBODY WHO HAS COME TO THE TABLE HAVE SIGNED ON TO THE FAIR FOOD PROGRAM EXCEPT  WENDY'S IN THE FAST FOOD AREA (BOOING) Stephen: NO WENDY'S?
YEAH WENDY'S HAS NOT SIGNED ON TO THE FAIR FOOD PROGRAM BUT IN THE SUPERMARKET AREA WHICH IS A LARGE BUYER OF PRODUCE, WE WANT PEOPLE TO EAT HEALTHY Stephen: ARE SUPERMARKETS ON BOARD WITH THIS?  SOME, NOT ALL. WE SIGNED WALMART ON, THEY ARE A  FAIR FOOD PROGRAM BUYER ARE ON BOARD. WHOLE FOODS. THIS TOMATO IS FROM WHOLE FOODS, SO WE KNOW IT'S A FAIR FOOD TOMATO.
Stephen: MEANING THIS IS LIKE A $40 TOMATO.
EXACTLY. LET ME TELL YOU, SO THE WORKERS MAKE A PENNY PER POUND. THIS TOMATO IS 2.03. SO YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE OF THE PEOPLE DOING THE WORK. PUBLIX IS THE ONE THAT WILL NOT COME TO THE TABLE, WILL NOT TALK TO THE C.I.W. ABOUT THE FAIR FOOD PROGRAM.
Stephen: WELL, MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU GUYS SCARE PEOPLE WITH YOUR TACTICS.
RIGHT.
Stephen: I'LL SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE. JIM, CAN YOU PUT UP THE POSTER? THAT IS SOCIALIST PROPAGANDA. THAT MIGHT AS WELL BE MAO PICKING THE TOMATOES UP THERE THIS DOESN'T SEEM A LITTLE WORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE  TO YOU?
NO, IT DOESN'T.
Stephen: IT DOESN'T? THIS IS AN INTERESTING PHOTO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SEE THE BUCKET. IT'S OVERFILLED. THE C.I.W. STOPPED THAT AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'LL MAKE THE WORKERS SNOW CONE THE BUCKETS, SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY PICKING ALMOST A BUCKET AND A THIRD AND NOT GETTING PAID FOR IT. SO WE'VE STOPPED THAT AS WELL AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS HOW THEY CARRY. THEY CARRY ABOUT 40,000 POUNDS A DAY ON THEIR BACKS, AND THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR WORKERS -- FARM WORKERS ARE NOT ASKING FOR A CRAZY AMOUNT OF PAY, THEY'RE ASKING TO BE PAID FOR THE WORK THEY'RE DOING. FAIR PAY
Stephen: MY OTHER ISSUE IS YOU'RE ASKING ME TO THINK ABOUT WHERE MY FOOD COMES FROM.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT. A LOT OF IT COMES FROM DIRT, OKAY? AND IT'S THERE A LOT LONGER THAN THE 5-SECOND RULE.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY MUST I THINK ABOUT WHERE MY FOOD COMES FROM? IT COMES FROM THE KITCHEN.
IT DOES NOT.
Stephen: IT DOES NOT? IT DOES NOT COME FROM THE KITCHEN. AMERICA HAS A HISTORY OF EXPLOITING LABOR. WHEN WE CREATED THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT WHICH PROTECTS WORKERS, IT EXCLUDED AGRICULTURE. THE 40-HOUR WORK WEEK, VACATION, MINIMUM-WAGE, EXCLUDES AGRICULTURE.
Stephen: CHILD LABOR. YOU WERE IN THE FIELD, YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS.
Stephen: I WORKED AN ENTIRE DAY.
NO, NO. I THINK YOU WORKED THREE HOURS.
Stephen: WELL, LISTEN, THAT IS A WORKDAY FOR ME. (LAUGHTER) EVA LONGORIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH! EVA LONGORIA, "FOOD CHAINS," THE DOCUMENTARY OPENS FRIDAY. BACK BACK! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
