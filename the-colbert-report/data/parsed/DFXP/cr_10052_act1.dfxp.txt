(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANKS SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR WATCHING THE SHOW.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO ANYBODY  OUT THERE WHAT THIS SHOW IS ALL ABOUT. BUT I KNOW AS AN AMERICAN IT IS EVERY CITIZEN'S DUTY TO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM. THAT'S WHY I HAVE BEEN SO INSPIRED BY THE RAG TAG GROUP OF REBELS IN THE UKRAINE. WHICH IS ATTEMPTING TO BREAK LONG-STANDING POLITICAL TIES WITH THE RUSSIA. NOW BOTH OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE SOME OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT TRADING PARTNERS AS THEY CONTAIN THE WORLD'S LARGEST STRATEGIC RESERVES OF ALCOHOLISM. NOW I GOT TO TELL YOU, TRUTH BE TOLD, I'M NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR ON WHO THESE REBELS ARE OR WHERE THE UKRAINE IS. BUT FOLKS, I DO KNOW I AM ON THEIR SIDE. BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, NOBODY RIOTS LIKE THE SLAVS. FIRST OF ALL LET'S JUST TALK COURAGE. LOOK AT THIS PRIEST, RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE THICK OF THE ACTION HOLDING UP A CROSS. I'M NOT SURE WHICH SIDE HAS THE VAMPIRES BUT THAT'S KIND OF COOL. (LAUGHTER) AND THE PROTESTORS HAVE GOT SOME BALLS. EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE OUTMANNED AND OUTGUNNED, THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN UP. THEY MADE THEIR OWN CATAPULT. (LAUGHTER) SO EVEN IF THEY LOSE THE REVOLUTION THEY'RE READY FOR NEXT SEASON'S PUNKIN CHUNKIN, PUNKIN CHUNKIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: PUNKIN. PUNKIN CHUNKIN. AND THE POLICE MAY HAVE ALL THE LATEST RIOT GEAR BUT THE PROTESTORS HAVE KITCHEN EQUIPMENT. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, YOU CAN TELL, YOU CAN TELL FROM THIS MAN'S FACE, HE'S FEELING THE STRAIN. AND THAT HELMET IS COMPLETELY IMPENETRABLE UNLESS THE POLICE SOMEHOW DEVELOP HOT WATER TECHNOLOGY. (LAUGHTER) IF THIS REVOLUTION SUCCEEDS 200 YEARS FROM NOW THE COLLANDER WILL BE THE SYMBOL OF UKRAINIAN FREEDOM JUST LIKE OUR FOUNDERS TRICORN HATS WHICH BY THE WAY WERE NOT NEARLY AS GOOD FOR DRAINING PASTA. (LAUGHTER) WELL, MY UKRAINIAN FRIENDS, I STAND WITH YOU. AND TO PROVE IT, I WILL WEAR THIS COLLANDER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH, LET FREEDOM RING. I WILL WEAR THIS COLLANDER UNTIL YOU ACHIEVE OR DEFEAT WHATEVER IT IS YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR OR AGAINST. UNTIL THEN, I JOIN YOUR BATTLE CRY, AL DENTE! (LAUGHTER) NATION, ENOUGH OF THAT. ALL RIGHT. [COLLANDER CLATTERS TO FLOOR] [LAUGHTER] NATION, I LOVE THE INTERNET. AND THE INTERNET LOVES ME BACK. WHY ELSE WOULD IT OFFER ME SO MUCH SEX. THAT'S WHY I WAS SHOCKED LAST WEEK WHEN I HEARD THIS GOSSIP ABOUT THE INTERNET FROM ITS FRENEMY, TELEVISION.
THE WAY WE USE THE INTERNET COULD CHANGE AFTER FEDERAL APPEALS COURT STRUCK DOWN NET NEUTRALITY RULES.
THE FALLOUT OVER A BIG DECISION THAT MAY CHANGE HOW THE WEB WORKS AND THE FUTURE OF SO-CALLED NET NEUTRALITY.
WE COULD BE WITNESSING THE END OF THE INTERNET AS WE KNOW IT.
Stephen: NATION, I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. BECAUSE I DO NOT. (LAUGHTER) MAYBE-- MAYBE THE TV KNOWS.
NET NEUTRALITY IS THE IDEA THAT BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS COMCAST, TIME WARNER CABLE, VERIZON AND OTHERS SHOULD TREAT EVERYTHING THAT FLOWS ACROSS THE INTERNET EQUALLY.
THANKS, TV.
YOU SEE, UNDER NET NEUTRALITY EVERY SITE ON THE INTERNET HAS TO BE EQUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE USER, WHETHER IT BE A HUGE BEHEMOTH LIKE GOOGLE OR SOME OBSCURE LITTLE MOM AND POP SITE LIKE BING. BUT FOLKS--  (LAUGHTER) THIS COURT RULING, THIS RECENT COURT RULING ENDS ALL OF THAT.
NET NEUTRALITY ADVOCATES SAY THIS RULING COULD ALSO ALLOW INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO SLOW EVERYTHING. AND THEN CHARGE YOU EXTRA TO ALLOW FASTER ACCESS TO A PARTICULAR SITE LIKE AMAZON.
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR SPECIFIC WEB SITES. THERE ARE A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY.
FOLKS, I WILL NOT STAND FOR MY CONTENT BEING HELD HOSTAGE FOR CASH. WE MUST RISE AS ONE AGAINST THE CABLE COMPANIES AND--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I HAVE RETHOUGHT MY POSITION ON NET NEUTRALITY. WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS LIKE ALL AMERICANS I LOVE MY CABLE COMPANY. THEY ADD SO MUCH OF MY LIFE, FOR INSTANCE ALL THE TIME I GET TO SPEND WITH MY FAMILY DURING THE THREE MINUTES IT TAKES FOR MY DVR TO PROCESS A CHANNEL CHANGE. AND IT WILL BE BETTER, THINK ABOUT IT, VERIZON SAYS THIS RULING ALLOWS BROADBAND PROVIDERS TO OFFER NEW AND INNOVATIVE SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WHILE ALLOWING MORE ROOM FOR INNOVATION AND KEEPING THE INTERNET A HUB OF INNOVATION. SEE? NET NEUTRALITY'S ONLY BEEN DEAD A WEEK AND ALREADY THREE INNOVATIVE USES OF THE WORD INNOVATION. IT USED TO HAVE TO MEAN SOMETHING. (APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I'M SO INSPIRED BY THIS NEW PARADIGM OF HOLDING CONTENT HOSTAGE THAT I HAVE IMPLEMENTED A FEW INNOVATIONS OF MY OWN HERE AT THE REPORT. SUCH AS MY NEW 2-FINITY PHONE SERVICE  WHERE MY EMPLOYEES CONTINUE TO ENJOY UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THE FIRST TWO DIGITS OF ANY NUMBER THEY DIAL ARE YOU ON FIRE? THEN JUST DIAL 9-1. (LAUGHTER) NEED ANOTHER 1? REASONABLE CHARGES APPLY. FOLKS, I SEE NOW THAT NET NEUTRALITY IS JUST STUPID. HERE TO SAY, "IS NOT," PLEASE WELCOME COLUMBIA LAW PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR OF "THE MASTER SWITCH," TIM WU, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU GOT THE BOOK HERE. CALLED THE MASTER SWITCH. ALL ABOUT THE INTERNET. YOU'RE THE INTERNET GUY. FIRST OF ALL, LET'S SETTLE THIS. NET NEUTRALITY, GOOD THING OR A BAD THING?
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY GOOD THING.
Stephen: BUT YOU WILL ADMIT IT IS A STUPID NAME, RIGHT. NET NEUTRALITY.
Tim: OH IT'S A GREAT NAME.
Stephen: WHO CAME UP WITH THAT NAME?
I DID. >>Stephen: OK, ALRIGHT. [LAUGHTER]
AS SOMEONE WHO IS A CONTENT CONSUMER, I GO ON, I USE THE INTERNETS AND I WATCH ALL THE THINGS. AND I-- IS THAT GOING TO COST ME MORE TO GET WHAT I WANT, IF I WATCH LIKE A TV SHOW ON THE INTERNET.
WHAT'S WILL HAPPEN WITHOUT NET NEUTRALITY IS THAT NETFLIX WILL START COSTING MORE, GOOGLE MAY COST MORE, EVERYTHING MAY COST MORE ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE THEY'RE NOW BEING BILLED, THEY'RE BEING TOLD, SO WHAT THE CABLE AND PHONE COMPANIES WANT TO DO IS IMPOSE A TOLL ON THE INTERNET TO REACH THEIR CUSTOMERS.
Stephen: SHOULDN'T RICH PEOPLE GET BETTER THINGS? I MEANS THAT'S WHY YOU BECOME RICH.
RIGHT.
SEE, THE THING IS IN THIS CASE, IT'S NOT EVEN RICH PEOPLE ARE GETTING MORE, IT'S JUST THE CABLE COMPANY OR THE PHONE COMPANY. IN OTHER WORDS, THE CABLE AND PHONE COMPANIES POSITION IS WE WOULD LIKE MORE MONEY. AND LAST TIME I CHECKED I THINK THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. THEY JUST WANT MORE MONEY.
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS CONCEPT OF ENOUGH MONEY IS. (LAUGHTER) IS THIS GOING TO AFFECT LIKE, AND I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THIS CORRECTLY, PORNOGRAPHY? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE NETFLIX STREAMS A LOT OF VIDEO BUT WHOEVER THAT IS OUT THERE WHO MAKES PORNOGRAPHY, THEY STREAM A LOT OF VIDEOS TOO.
IT ACTUALLY COULD. BECAUSE THE BASIC POSITION THE PHONE AND CABLE COMPANIES IS IF YOU ARE MAKING MONEY, WE WOULD LIKE OUR CUT. GIVEN THAT PORNOGRAPHY SEEMS TO MAKE MONEY, SEEMS TO BE POPULAR. THE BASIC IDEA IS YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO GET-- .
Stephen: SOME PEOPLE ARE IN IT FOR JUST THE LOVE OF THE GAME. (LAUGHTER) THE BASIC IDEA IS IF YOU PAY FOR THE INTERNET YOU SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO GET WHATEVER YOU WANT. AND THE PHONE COMPANY, AND THE CABLE COMPANIES SHOULDN'T BE DECIDING WHAT THAT IS, WHETHER OR NOT IT'S PORNOGRAPHY, WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A BLOG OR EVEN DOWNLOADS OF YOUR SHOW.
Stephen: OKAY, BUT FOR THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS OUT THERE, THE ISPs FOR THEM THIS IS A MATTER OF FREE SPEECH. THEY WANT TO BE FREE TO CHARGE YOU FOR SPEECH.
RIGHT. THEIR THEORY-- .
Stephen: WHY ARE YOU AGAINST FREE SPEECH? WHY ARE YOU AGAINST FREE SPEECH? (APPLAUSE) SO THEIR THEORY IS THAT THE RIGHT TO SENSOR THINGS IS THEIR FREE SPEECH. IN OTHER WORDS, IF THEY WANT TO BLOCK GOOGLE OR NETFLIX OR CHARGE MORE FOR NETFLIX THAT'S FREE SPEECH. THAT IS NOT MY IDEA OF FREE SPEECH. MY IDEA OF FREE SPEECH IS, WHEN YOU USE THE INTERNET YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET WHAT YOU WANT AND WHEN SOMEONE WANTS TO SPEAK WITH YOU ON THE INTERNET THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEND YOU WHAT YOU WANT. THAT IS ACTUAL FREE SPEECH.
Stephen: BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOMEONE IN CONTROL. I MEAN LIKE, YOU'RE ON MY SHOW. YOU'VE GOT FREE SPEECH RIGHT NOW BUT IF I-- LET EVERYBODY COME ON MY SHOW AT ONCE WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND.
YOU KNOW, THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS NEED TO BE SOMEONE IN CONTROL, ACTUALLY.
YOU KNOW WE DRIVE DOWN THE ROAD--  (LAUGHTER) WHEN YOU DRIVE ACROSS THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE, THERE'S NO ONE DECIDING WHO GETS TO DRIVE ON THE BRIDGE.
NO, BUT ON THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE-- CHRISTIE DECIDES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TIM WU, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. TIM WU, THE MASTER SWITCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
