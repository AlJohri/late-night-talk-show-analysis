(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE AUTHOR OF "EXCELLENT SHEEP" ABOUT THE FAILURE OF IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ON THE TEST.  PLEASE WELCOME WILLIAM DERESIEWICZ! GOOD TO SEE YOU! IS IT DR. DERESIEWICZ, DO YOU HAVE A Ph.D.?
I DO. YOU CAN CALL ME BILL.
Stephen: FINE. DR. BILL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU'RE A CONTRIBUTING WRITER TO THE NATION, A CONTRIBUTING EDITOR FOR THE NEW REPUBLIC AND THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR. YOU TAUGHT AT YALE FOR TEN YEARS, AND BEFORE THAT  YOU WERE A GRADUATE INSTRUCTOR AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED EXCELLENT SHEEP, THE MISEDUCATION OF THE AMERICAN ELITE AND THE WAY TO A MEANINGFUL LIFE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT TITLE IS AS LONG AS THE DOCTORATE, OKAY. (LAUGHTER) I HOPE THAT TITLE WENT THROUGH PEER REVIEW.
YEAH.
Stephen: SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE MISEDUCATION OF THE AMERICAN ELITE? ARE YOU SAYING LIKE IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS AREN'T WHAT THEY'RE CRACKED UP FOR?
THEY'RE NOT WHAT THEY'RE CRACKED UP TO BE. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TRAINING A WONDERFUL LEADERSHIP CLASS.
STEPHEN: BUT YOU'RE AN IVY LEAGUE GUY, RIGHT?
I AM.
Stephen: WHY DID ONE OF THE IVY LEAUGUE PEOPLE WRITE THE BOOK SAYING, DON'T GO TO THOSE IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS! LET ME PULL UP THAT LADDER BEHIND ME, MUST BE IN YOUR WAY! ENJOY YOUR STATE SCHOOL, HAVE A GREAT TIME! I HEAR THEY  HAVE FRATS
IF WE HADN'T WORKED THERE, YOU WOULD SAY, WHAT DO YOU GUYS KNOW? WE'VE SEEN WHAT GOES ON IN THE SAUSAGE FACTORY, WE'VE SEEN HOW THE ELITE ARE PRODUCED.
Stephen: HOW ARE THEY PRODUCED? I'M AN ELITE MYSELF. I WENT TO DARTMOUTH, MY FRIEND.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
Stephen: YEAH. WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT DO KIDS HAVE TO DO TO GET THERE.
Stephen: MY GRANDFATHER HAD TO BUILD A BUILDING.
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS ANYMORE.
Stephen: REALLY, YOU CAN'T JUST BUILD A BUILDING? THEY JUMP THROUGH ONE HOOP THROUGH ANOTHER TO BECOME PERFECTIONIST AND CONFORMIST. KIDS ARE TAUGHT TO JUMP THROUGH THE HOOPS AND NOT THINK FOR THEMSELVES OR DIRECT THEIR OWN LIVES OR DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AFTER COLLEGE AND THE COLLEGES DO NOTHING TO GET IN THE WAY. SO WE HAVE KIDS WHO ARE GREAT AT GETTING A'S BUT NOT GREAT AT FIGURING OUT WHAT'S GOING TO GIVE THEM A SENSE OF MEANING AND PURPOSE IN THEIR LIFE, MAKE THEM THE LEADERS THE COLLEGES ARE SUPPOSEDLY PREPARING TO DO, THE LEADERS WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH. WE'VE SEEN THIS BASICALLY MASSIVE FAILURE IN THE LEADERSHIP CLASS IN THE LAST 10, 15, 20, 30 YEARS, THAT THESE SCHOOLS ARE CREATING.
Stephen: I'M A LEADER. YOU'RE A LEADER. WHAT'S THE FAILURE OF THE LEADERSHIP?
WE ARE EXCEPTIONS, STEPHEN. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: SO WE'RE OKAY. WE'RE OKAY. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT BANKS, CORPORATIONS, GOVERNMENT, SCHOOLS, NONPROFITS. THEY'RE NOT DOING THEIR JOBS. THEY'RE NOT SERVING SOCIETY AS A WHOLE BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOURSELF. THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA ABOUT GETTING INTO THE SCHOOLS, HIGH STATUS, HIGH WEALTH. WHAT ABOUT SERVING SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.
Stephen: HOW SHOULD KIDS -- IF IT'S NOT WORKING HARD IN HIGH SCHOOL AND CONFORMING TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF SOCIETY AND THEN CRUSHING IT WHEN YOU'RE AT BROWN OR COLUMBIA AND THEN SLIDING YOURSELF INTO WALL STREET AND DOING YOUR THING THERE AND MAKING TONS OF CASH AND GOING OFF TO, LIKE, YOUR CABIN IN BELIZE ON THE WEEKEND.
AND DO WHAT YOUR PEERS WANT YOU TO DO.
Stephen: YOU COMPLAIN A LOT BUT I HEAR NO ANSWERS,
IT'S IN THE BOOK.
Stephen: I'M NOT GONNA READ YOUR BOOK! (LAUGHTER) WHAT ARE THE ANSWERS? WHAT ARE THE ANSWERS, BILL?
FORGET ABOUT WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS YOU TO DO, START TO LISTEN TO YOURSELF, START TO READ, TO THINK, TAKE TIME OFF, TAKE TIME AWAY FROM THE SYSTEM, STEP OUTSIDE OF THE BUBBLE, START TO TUNE IN TO WHAT --
Stephen: DID YOU DO THAT? REPEATEDLY.
Stephen: WHEN DID YOU DO THAT?
I SPENT FOUR YEARS AFTER COLLEGE BEFORE I FIGURED OUT WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT THINGS IN COLLEGE, BECAUSE I DIDN'T SHUT OUT ALL THE MESSAGES EVERYBODY ELSE WAS GIVING ME. I MAJORED IN THE WRONG THING. MAYBE I WENT TO THE WRONG COLLEGE MYSELF. IN THE END, IT WAS A LONGER PROCESS THAN IT NEEDED TO BE.
Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR MAJOR?
I WAS ACTUALLY A BIOPSYCHOLOGY MAJOR.
Stephen: WHAT IS BIOPSYCHOLOGY? DO YOU GET TO WRITE YOURSELF YOUR OWN PRESCRIPTIONS?
IT'S WHAT THEY NOW CALL COGNITIVE SCIENCE. IT'S WHAT  I THOUGHT I COULD DO. MY DAD WAS A SCIENTIST AND IMMIGRANT. HE PUSHED ME IN THAT DIRECTION. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISH MAJOR. I DID A Ph.D. IN ENGLISH BECAUSE I FIGURED OUT THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED TO DO TO MAKE ME HAPPY TO FEEL LIKE I WAS CONTRIBUTING.
Stephen: SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT MAKES DAD HAPPY. HE'S AN IMMIGRANT! YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART! YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART! I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, BILLY! WE DIDN'T COME TO THIS COUNTRY FOR YOU TO SMOKE POT AND PLAY MADDEN IN YOUR DORM ROOM! YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK I BROKE HIS HEART, TOO, BUT SOMETIMES THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO BECAUSE YOU'RE LIVING YOUR LIFE AND NOT YOUR PARENTS' LIVES.
Stephen: I CERTAINLY HOPE MY CHILDREN AREN'T WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW. YOU DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAY AT ALL TIMES! (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH, WILLIAM DERESIEWICZ.
THANK YOU (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
