["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL [EAGLE CAW] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN"] THANK  VERY MUCH. PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. IN HERE, OUT THERE, EVERYWHERE,  EVERYBODY. NATION, I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I CANNOT TELL A LIE, I HAVE A  SWORN DUTY TO TELL YOU TRUTH  EVERY TIME I SPEAK TO YOU NO MATTER WHAT HEARS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN HARD -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN. NATION, I'VE MISSED YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'VE BEEN ON VACATION FOR THE  LAST TWO WEEKS IN THE KAY MAN  ISLANDS VISITING MY -- CAYMAN ISLANDS VISITING MY MONEY. [LAUGHTER] IT SAYS HI BY THE WAY. THE MISS THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE OF  NEWS CYCLE. GETTING MY OPINION OUT THERE  ABOUT THE STORIES THAT MATTER,  THE CRISIS IN CYPRUS, THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN, THE RELEASE  OF "THE CROODS". THIS MOVIE HAS A SMALL  GOVERNMENT MESSAGE IN THAT  GOVERNMENT HAS NOT YET BEEN  INVENTED. BUT AS ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST  INFLUENTIAL CATHOLICS I WANTED  TO COVER THE CONCLAVE TO NAME A NEW POPE. IT'S LIKE THE CHRISTIAN SUPER  BOWL EXCEPT WITH LESS THANKING  JESUS. [LAUGHTER] AS A BROADCASTER, I LOVE THIS  STORY, FOLKS, BECAUSE THERE'S NO  MORE THRILLING TV THAN LIVE FOOTAGE OF THE VATICAN CHIMNEY. [LAUGHTER] SANTA'S FIRST STOP EVERY YEAR BY  THE WAY. WAITING FOR THAT PIVOTAL MOMENT  WHEN THE SMOKE CHANGES COLOR.
WE HAVE SMOKE. IT APPEARS -- IT APPEARS GRAY. IT'S WHITISH.
THE SMOKE IS WHITE AND IT  APPEARS WE HAVE A NEW POPE.
BREAKING NEWS, THE WORLD'S  1.2 BILLION ROMAN CATHOLICS HAVE  A NEW POPE.
WE HAVE A NEW POPE.
Stephen: YES, WE HAVE A NEW  POPE, ME AND THE REVEREND AL  SHARPTON. SEE YOU AT MASS ON SUNDAY, AL. [ LAUGHTER ] THE POINT IS:  THE LORD HATH  SMOKEIN. HABEAS THIS GUY-EM. CARDINAL JORGE BERGOGLIO OF  ARGENTINA OR AS HE WILL BE KNOWN  POPE FRANCIS. THE FIRST POPE NAMED FOR ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI, ONE OF THE  MOST BELOVED OF ALL TIME. THAT'S A BALLSY MOVE, IT'S LIKE  GOING WITH THE NAME POPE KITTEN  FALLING ASLEEP. [LAUGHTER] POPE FRANKY HAS WASTE NOD TIME. OUR POPE NOW NO LONGER LOOKS  LIKE HE IS OUT TO CRUSH THE  REBEL ALLIANCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT AS MUCH -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- AS MUCH AS I LIKE THE NEW  PONTIFF, I MAY HE MAY BE GOING  TOO FAF WITH HIS MESSAGE OF POPE AND CHANGE. [LAUGHTER]
SETTING A TONE FOR A HUMBLER,  SIMPLER PAIP CINCH HE DREAMS OF  A CHURCH ON THE SIDE OF THE  POOR.
HE REFUSED TO SIT ON A THROWN  TO ACCEPT OATH OF ALLEGIANCE BUT  STOOD ON THE SAME LEVEL.
POPE FRANCIS SHOCKED A  NEWSPAPER STAND WHEN HE  PERSONALLY CALLED TO CANCEL HIS  SUBSCRIPTION.
HE IS A GUY WHO RIDES THE  BUS.
POPE FRANCIS DOESN'T WANT THE  LIMO OR THE FANCY RED SHOES.
EVEN HIS SHOES, REGULAR BLACK  ONES, NOT THE EXPENSIVE LEATHER  RED SHOES POPE BENEDICT FAVORED.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, NO  RED SHOES? THAT'S -- SACRILEGE. NOW THE FLEET OF FLYING MONKEYS  WILL MAKE NO SENSE. THE CHURCH TO BE POOR? THAT'S NOT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH I  SIGNED UP FOR RM WHEN I TOSS A  SAW BUCK IN THE BASKET I WANT PRODUCTION VALUES THAT MEANS  MARBLE, GOLD AND STAINED GLASS. I BELIEVE RELIGION SHOULD BE  LIKE GOING TO THE AVENGERS, WHO  CARES WHAT IT'S ABOUT, AS LONG AS IT LOOKS COOL AND CAN I EAT  POPCORN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] AND THOSE ARE NOT THE ONLY  TRADITIONS POPE FRANCIS IS  THROWING OUT THE WINDOW.
A MAJOR BREAK IN TRADITION  THE MASS ON HOLY THURSDAY WILL  BE HELD IN A CHAPEL AT A JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY. DURING THE CEREMONY POPE FRANCIS  WILL WASH THE FEET OF 12 YOUNG  INMATES.
Stephen: WASHING THE FEET  OF YOUNG INMATES. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. I HAVE TO CAMP OUT OVERNIGHT IN  ST. PETER'S SQUARE JUST TO CATCH  A GLIMPSE OF HIM. MEANWHILE SOME HOOLIGAN BAMBINO  JACKS A STEERO AND NEXT THING  YOU KNOW HE'S GETTING HIS FEET WASHED BY THE POPE. HE'S GETTING A MANI-POPEE. I DON'T GET IT. YOUR HOLINESS IF YOU DON'T WANT  TO END UP AS SOMEBODY'S PUNK IN  PRISON, AS SOON AS YOU GET UP THERE WALK UP TO THE BIGGEST GUY  IN THE YARD AND YOU JUST BLESS  HIM RIGHT IN THE FACE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, TALKING ABOUT THE JESUS. FLOOFORT FOUR WEEKS -- FOR THE  LAST FOUR YEARS -- GOD I HOPE  THAT WASN'T JESUS I WAS ABOUT TO THE HIT. [LAUGHTER] FOR THE LAST FOUR WEEKS, WE'VE  BEEN GLUED TO THE HISTORY  CHANNEL'S FIVE-PART MINI SERIES "THE BIBLE."  AND MINI SERIES IS APPROPRIATE,  I THINK BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD  DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THE LEGS TO SUSTAIN AN ENTIRE SERIES LIKE  THE HISTORY CHANNEL'S "BIG  SHRIMPIN."  WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THE SEASON FINALE COMING WHEN THEY CAUGHT  MORE SHRIMP? [LAUGHTER] NOW "THE BIBLE" IS BROUGHT TO  YOU BY AMERICA'S PREEMINENT THEE  LOGICAL SCHOLARS SURVIVOR PRODUCER MARK BURNETT AND HIS  WIFE FORMER TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL  STAR ROMA DOWNEY WHO ALSO PLAYS THE VIRGIN MARY. I WONDER WHO SHE HAD TO SLEEP  WITH TO GET THAT PART? NOBODY! IT'S CALLED THE IMMACULATE  AUDITION. THIS IS HUGE. [LAUGHTER] DON'T TAKE IT FROM ME, FOLKS. THIS IS HOW HUGE IT IS. TAKE IT FROM THE MAN WHO WROTE  THE BIBLE, MARK BURNETT.
IN 2013 IT'S PUT FRESHNESS OF  LIFE TO THE GREATEST STORY EVER  TOLD. MILLIONS WILL OPEN THE BIBLE OR  REOPEN IT. MAYBE A BILLION.
A BILLION NEW PEOPLE WILL  OPEN THE BIBLE.
I'M A BLUNT PERSON AND TO BE  HONEST WITH YOU A BILLION IS A  LOW NUMBER.
Stephen: A BILLION IS A WAY  LOW NUMBER BECAUSE AS THE BIBLE  SAYS PRIDE COMEth BEFORE GIANT TV RATINGS. IF YOU ENJOY WATCHING "THE  BIBLE" YOU WANT TO EXPLORE THE  SOURCE MATERIAL. I SPEAK, OF COURSE, OF THE STORY  OF GOD AND ALL OF US A NOVEL  BASED ON THE EPIC TV SERIES "THE BIBLE."  ALL THE BIBLICAL STORIES YOU  LOVED FROM THE SERIES FINALLY  ASSEMBLED INTO ONE BOOK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] BUT AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE BIBLE,  I DO HAVE ONE BEEF, A BEEFCAKE  JESUS. JESUS MAKES HIS FIRST APPEARANCE  IN THIS MINI SERIES THIS COMING  SUNDAY COX BE A RATINGS BONANZA.
SURE.
BIRTH OF JESUS, HIS BAPTISM  AND I'LL REMAIN FROM MAKE ANY  COMMENTS ABOUT JESUS' HUNKY  APPEARANCE.
A GOOD-LOOKING JESUS.
Stephen: YES, THEIR JESUS  IS WAY TOO HOT. IT IS NOT PROJECT HOLINESS WHEN  YOU CANNOT LOOK AT HIM WITHOUT  SAYING GODDAMN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MORE IMPORTANTLY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'RE SUPPOSED  TO RELATE TO A JESUS THAT  SUFFERED ALL THAT WE SUFFERED. HE DOESN'T KNOW OUR PAIN. HE IS BEING PLAYED BY DIOGO  MORGADO A PORTEES STAR AND  MODEL. WE WANT A JEEZ YUCK LIKE US WITH  A GROWING WAIST LANE AND REDUCED  HAIRLINE. WE WANT A JESUS WHO SPENDS LESS  TIME WALKING ON WATER AND MORE  TIME SITTING IN A BABY POOL DRINKING FRANZIA. MARK BURNETT THERE'S ONE EPISODE  LEFT. LOSE THE MODEL AND GIVING YOU  THE SHLUBBY BROKEN DOWN JESUS WE  CAN IDENTIFY WITH. BECAUSE I LIKE TO THIS THINK  THAT THE REAL REASON IS THERE'S  ONLY ONE SET OF FOOTPRINTS IN THE SAND IS BECAUSE JESUS  DOESN'T GO TO THE BEACH. HE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE TO TAKE  HIS SHIRT
