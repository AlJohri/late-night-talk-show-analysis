Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE LONGEST  SERVING CONGRESSMAN IN AMERICAN  HISTORY. I'M GOING TO ASK HIM WITH WHAT  EISENHOWER SMELLED LIKE. PLEASE WELCOME JOHN DINGELL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JOHN DINGELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR BEING HERE. SIT DOWN, SIR. GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. THIS IS AN HISTORIC WEEK FOR  AMERICA.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN. Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU ARE WHAT THEY CALL THE DEAN  OF THE HOUSE, KIND OF HISTORY,  THE MEMORY OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE IS IT  THIS FRIDAY...
THIS FRIDAY. Stephen: ... YOU'LL BECOME  THE LONGEST SERVING MEMBER OF  CONGRESS IN HISTORY.
THAT'S RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
IF I WERE PRESIDENT I'D BE  CALLED THE FATHER OF THE HOUSE.
Stephen: OKAY. BUT YOU'RE NOT.
I'M NOT. Stephen: ALL RIGHT. WHAT WAS IT LIKE IN 1955 WHEN  YOU STARTED IN THE CONGRESS. WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR A FRESHMAN  BACK THEN.
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SEEN  AND NOT HEARD. BUT ON TOP OF THAT, I WALKED IN  THE DAY THEY WERE HAVING A  COMMEMORATION OF MY DAD'S  SERVICE.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOUR FATHER  REPRESENTED THE SAME DISTRICT  BEFORE YOU DID.
THAT'S RIGHT. SO I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF  GETTING UP AND THANKING HIS  FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES OF WHOM HE HAD MANY IN THE CONGRESS ON  BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.
Stephen: WHAT, WHAT, WHAT? IT HAPPENS, STEPHEN, IT DID. Stephen: WE CURED THAT. (LAUGHING). Stephen: BUT GO AHEAD. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF  TELLING THEM HOW DAD WOULD HAVE  FELT TO HEAR THEM SAYING THESE THINGS ABOUT HIM, HOW GRATEFUL I  WAS TO THEM FOR THEIR  REMEMBERING MY DAD AND ALSO HOW GRATEFUL I WAS TO THEM FOR  WELCOMING ME TO SUCCEED WHAT I  THOUGHT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT  AMERICANS.
Stephen: YOU'RE IMPLYING THAT  REPUBLICANS -- YOU'RE A  DEMOCRAT.
YES. Stephen: DID YOU RUN AS A  DEMOCRAT OR YOU A WHIG OR A BULL  MOOSE BACK THEN? BECAUSE THE PARTIES HAVE CHANGED  OVER THE YEARS. THE PARTIES HAVE CHANGED OVER  THE YEARS.
THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE.
Stephen: YOU ALWAYS RAN AS A  DEMOCRAT.
I GOT MY DEMOCRACY WITH MY  MOTHER'S MILK. I AM A DEMOCRAT.
Stephen: IT'S A FAMILY SHOW. IT'S A FAMILY SHOW. I THINK WE HAVE TO DELETE THAT  PART. BUT YOU WERE ACTUALLY IN  WASHINGTON BECAUSE YOU WERE  THERE BEFORE 1955. WHAT YEAR DID YOU ACTUALLY GO TO  WASHINGTON.
IN 1933 WHEN DAD WAS SWORN IN  IN THE HOUSE.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU AT  THE TIME.
I WAS SIX. Stephen: SIX YEARS OLD IN  WASHINGTON D.C. HOW HOW YOUNG ARE YOU NOW?
86. Stephen: 86. FOR 80 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN IN  WASHINGTON. WHAT'S THE BIGGEST CHANGE YOU'VE  SEEN IN 80 YEARS IN WASHINGTON?
I THINK LOSS OF COLLEGIALITY. Stephen: WHAT IS  COLLEGIALITY? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
GOOD WILL. GOOD HUMOR. A WILLINGNESS TO WORK TOGETHER. FRIENDLINESS.
Stephen: BUT A WILLINGNESS TO  WORK TOGETHER IMPLIES TO ME THAT  YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR POSITION, THAT YOU HAVE A  POSITION AND OPPOSE YOUR  POSITION. NOW, LISTEN. IF YOU HAVE A POSITION ON A LAW  OR SOME ACTION OF CONGRESS AND I  HAVE A DIFFERENT POSITION, IF I WANT SOMETHING ELSE TO HAPPEN,  IF I GIVE YOU AN INCH, I'M  TOTALLY WRONG. IF YOU'RE RIGHT AT ALL, I'M  TOTALLY WRONG. AND THE PROOF OF MY RIGHTNESS IS  YOUR COMPLETE WRONGNESS.
I DISAGREE. Stephen: YOU DISAGREE. YOU'RE TOTALLY WRONG FOR  DISAGREEING WITH ME.
WELL, THERE ARE 435 OF US  UNDER THE CONSTITUTION WHO WERE  SENT TO WASHINGTON AND WE'RE TOLD TO WORK OUT AND TO SOLVE  GREAT PROBLEMS OF THE NATION AND  TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. AND AT SOME POINT IN THE MIDDLE  OR SOMEWHERE THERE IS A POINT  WHERE WE COULD COME TO AN HONORABLE AGREEMENT. COMPROMISE IS AN HONORABLE WORD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: YOU MEAN COMPROMISE  ON HISTORIC LEGISLATION, WHAT  ARE THE ACHIEVEMENTS OR WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU WERE PART  OF, THE BILLS THAT WERE PASSED  THAT YOU'RE MOST PROUD OF.
THE SINGLE ONE IS 1964 CIVIL  RIGHTS ACT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE STOPPED THE NATION FROM BEING  TORN APART. AND JUST A FEW YEARS LATER IF WE  LOOK WE CAN SEE IN THE WHITE  HOUSE WE HAVE AN  AFRICAN-AMERICAN WHO WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO VOTE IN MANY  STATES BEFORE WE PASSED THAT  LEGISLATION.
Stephen: THAT BRINGS ME TO  ONE OF MY BIGGEST BEEFS WITH  YOU. AFRICAN-AMERICANS GET THE RIGHT  TO VOTE. I'M NOT A BAD GUY. I'M A GOOD GUY. BUT YOU'VE BEEN IN CONGRESS  LONGER THAN HAWAII HAS HAD A  CONGRESSMAN.
AND LONGER THAN ALASKA. Stephen: LONGER THAN ALASKA  TOO. DID YOU VOTE IN CONGRESS TO  INCLUDE HAWAII?
YES. Stephen: SO WE CAN BLAME  OBAMA ON YOU.
(LAUGHING) STEPHEN, WOULD YOU  GIVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER A  LITTLE CREDIT.
Stephen: YOU ARE THE FATHER  OF THE HOUSE. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. MICHIGAN REPRESENTATIVE JOHN  DINGELL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
