Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR THE REPORT. BEFORE WE GO I JUST WANT TO WISH A BIG WARM WELCOME TO THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE COLBERT NATION EVA JEAN-MARCO, BRAND-NEW DAUGHTER OF COLBERT REPORT GRAPHICS DESIGNER BILL MARCO. BILL IS ONE OF THE PHOTO SHOP WIZARDS WHO TAKES REALITY AND DIGITALLY ENHANCES IT UNTIL IT IS TO MY LIKING. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. SO CONGRATULATIONS TO BILL, HIS WIFE KATIE AND EVA. I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER IF I WERE RIDING ON A FLYING TIGER WITH KATE UPTON AN DONALD TRUMP. DAMN IT! BILL, GET BACK TO WORK. GOOD NIGHT.
