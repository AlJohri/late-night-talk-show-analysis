Stephen:  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, EVERYBODY WHO WATCHES  THIS SHOW KNOWS THAT WE ARE  ENGAGED IN A WAR AGAINST THE  GAYS. THE LATEST BATTLEFIELD IS  CALIFORNIA WHERE GOVERNOR JERRY  BROWN RECENTLY SIGNED A LAW BANNING GAY REPAIRIVE THE  THERAPY: TREATMENTS AIMED AT  TURNING GAY KIDS STRAIGHT. JUST BECAUSE THE AMERICAN  PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION SAYS  GAY CONVERSION THERAPY CAN CAUSE DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. BIG DEAL! SO DOES LUNESTA. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S JUST AMBIEN FOR GAY  PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY THERE'S A BUTTERFLY. FORTUNATELY -- THAT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. FORTUNATELY, FEDERAL JUDGE  WILLIAM SHOVE TOLD CALIFORNIA TO  SHOVE IT.
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS  BEEN BLOCKED FROM ENFORCING A  NEW BAN ON THERAPY THAT SEEKS TO CHANGE THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF  MINORS FROM GAY TO STRAIGHT. A FEDERAL JUDGE RULED THE LAW  MAY INHIBIT THE FIRST AMENDMENT  RIGHTS OF THERAPISTS WHO OPPOSE  HOMOSEXUALITY.
Stephen: DAMN STRAIGHT! THESE KIDS NEED OUR HELP. NOT ONLY ARE THEY GAY, LOOK HOW  BLURRY THEY ARE! (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S ALL RIGHT. FOLKS, THIS IS A GOOD CALL  BECAUSE THESE ANTI-GAY  TREATMENTS ARE PROVEN. A RECENT LAWSUIT IN NEW JERSEY  HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE MOST  EFFECTIVE METHODS ANTI-GAY THERAPISTS USE.
IN ANOTHER EXERCISE A MAN HAS  TO BREAK THROUGH A HUMAN  BARRICADE THAT I WAS A PART OF IN ORDER TO SEIZE TWO ORANGES  THAT WERE MEANT TO SYMBOLIZE HIS  TESTICLES. HE WAS THEN INSTRUCTED TO  SQUEEZE THE JUICE FROM THEM AND  DRINK THEM AND PUT THE ORANGES IN HIS PANTS IN ORDER TO  REPRESENT GAINING HIS TESTICLES. THE SYMBOLIC ABSENCE OF THEM  SUPPOSEDLY BEING A CAUSE OF HIS  HOMOSEXUALITY. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALSO A GREAT WAY TO  PROVIDE FRESH-SQUEEZED O.J. FOR  THE CLINIC'S BREAKFAST BAR. OTHERS HAD PATIENTS BEATING AN  EFFIGY OF THEIR MOTHERS WITH A  TENNIS RACKET, BEING SUBJECTED TO RIDICULE AS FAGGOTS AND  VISITING BATHHOUSES AND ORDERED  TO BE NUDE WITH FATHER FIGURES. WELL, THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. THEY CURE YOU BY THROWING YOU IN  A ROOM WITH A BUNCH OF NAKED  MEN. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR DAD CAUGHT  YOU SMOKING AND FORCED YOU TO  SMOKE A WHOLE CARTON OF CIGARETTES WITH A BUNCH OF NAKED  MEN. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  JUDGE SHOVE REMINDS US THAT THE  EVIDENCE OF EMOTIONAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY GAY CONVERSION THERAPY  IS BASED ON QUESTIONABLE AND  SCIENTIFICALLY INCOMPLETE STUDIES UNLIKELY TO SATISFY THE  DEMANDS OF STRICT SCRUTINY. EXACTLY! THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS  THAT WITH STAND THE SORT OF  STRICT SCRUTINY THAT STUFFING ORANGES DOWN YOUR PANTS DOES. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE IF WE OUTLAW THESE  THERAPIES WE'VE HAVE NO CHOICE  BUT TO SIT BACK AND LET PEOPLE BE GAY! JUST LIKE WE GAVE UP ON CURING  LEFT-HANDEDNESS. (LAUGHTER)  AND NOW WE'VE GOT ONE OF THEM  THE WHITE HOUSE. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
