Colbert: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A TWO TERM POET LAUREATE OF THE UNITED STATES. I WILL ASK HIM IF HE EVER SPIED ON GERMANY'S POET LAUREATE.  PLEASE WELCOME BILLY COLLINS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOU ARE WEARING A TIE. THAT IS VERY -- OF YOU.
DISTINGUISHED.
DISTINGUISHED.
Colbert: WHATEVER.
YOU ARE THE POET, YOU ARE THE POET, YOU ARE THE WORD SMITH.
THAT'S ME.
Colbert: TWO TERM POET LAUREATE OF THE UNITED STATES. HOW DO YOU GET THAT GIG?
WELL, YOU GET A CALL FROM THE LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, WAY WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WHITE HOUSE.
Colbert: SO OBAMA SAYS. OBAMA HAD NO AWARENESS YOU WERE THE POET LAUREATE, HE FOUND OUT BY WATCHING THIS SHOW.
A COUPLE OF PRESIDENTS, IT WAS STARTED BY W.
Colbert: SO YOU ARE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES. YOU GO WITH THAT BOAT TRI. NOW, I DON'T WANT TO START A COMPETITION HERE BUT I ALSO HAD ROBERT PINSKY A FEW TIMES WHO WAS THREE-TIME POET LAUREATE OF THE UNITED STATES. I AM KIND OF SLUMMING RIGHT NOW.
NOW YOU HAVE GOT A NEW COLLECTION OF POETRY HERE CALLED AIM LESS LOVE, NEW AND SELECTED POEMS. BEFORE WE ACTUALLY GET INTO THE NITTY-GRITTY, YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED THE MOST POPULAR POET IN AMERICA. DOES THAT HURT?
WELL --
Colbert: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
IT IS GOOD FOR MY SELF-ESTEEM.
Colbert: AREN'T THE BEST PHOTOS THE ONES NOBODY READS AND THEY DIE OF CONSUMPTION AT 25?
KEATS WAS A GREAT POET.
HE WAS NOT POPULAR IN HIS TIME, THEY SAY HE DIED OF A BAD REVIEW.
Colbert: ANYWAY.
ANYWAY, I THINK A HAPPY POET DOESN'T HAVE TO BE -- IT IS HARD TO ACCOUNT FOR YOUR OWN POPULARITY AND ONE IS I DON'T DRAG PEOPLE INTO MY WORLD OF PERSONAL MISERY, I AM NOT AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL POET.
Colbert: REALLY?
REALLY.
Colbert: SO IT IS ABOUT.
IT IS ABOUT WHAT MY PERSONA IS SAYING THESE WORDS. IT IS NOT EXACTLY ME. IT IS SORT OF AN IMPROVEMENT ON ME.
Colbert: SO IT IS NOT EXACTLY YOU. IT IS SOMEONE WITH YOUR SAME NAME BUT --
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
HE DOESN'T HAVE A JOFNLT HE DOESN'T TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE.
Colbert: DO YOU HAVE A JOB?
I HAVE A JOB.
Colbert: WHAT IS THE JOB OF THE POET LAUREATE?  WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES?
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE WHAT THE BRITISH -- THE POEMS, WHAT THE BRITISH POET LAUREATE DOES AND THE POET, THE POEM POET LAUREATE WE BORROWED THAT FROM THE BRITISH AND THE REASON THEY HAVE ONE IS BECAUSE FOR 400 YEARS BEFORE CAMERAS AND ANY RECORDING DEVICES, IF THERE WAS A LARGE EVENT, LIKE A CORONATION OR A BEHEADING OR --
Colbert: OF COURSE A BEHEADING WAS LIKE THE SUPER BOWL.
PUBLIC HANGS SO THE POET LAUREATE WOULD COMMEMORATE THIS EVENT IN VERSE AND THERE BY STORE IT IN THE NATIONAL MEMORY. SO NOW WE HAVE OTHER WAYS OF DOING THAT. WE REALLY DON'T NEED A POET LAUREATE, BUT IT CONTINUES. AND I AM HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
Colbert: DO YOU GET ANYTHING GOOD?  DO YOU GET ANYTHING GOOD THAT COMES WIT.
YES, YOU GET A COOL OFFICE IN THE JEFFERSON LIBRARY, THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, THE JEFFERSON BUILDING, IT IS UP IN WHAT THEY CALL THE ATTIC BUT IT HAS A BALCONY, IT IS PRETTY NICE. AND --
Colbert: OTHER POETRY, ARE THERE POET GROUPIES, BECAUSE YOU MUST BE DRIPPING.
WELL, THE PHONE NUMBER RANGE THERE WHEN I WAS POET LAUREATE -- I WAS IN GREAT DEMAND.
Colbert: YOU HAD TO CUT THE WIRE TO GIVE YOURSELF PEACE. YOU HAVE GOT A POEM IN HERE, THE TITLE POEM, ACTUALLY, AIM LESS LOVE.
UH-HUH.
Colbert: IN IT, IT IS ABOUT SOMEONE WHO FALLS IN LOVE WITH A BAR OF SOAP.
RIGHT.
Colbert: AT THE CONCLUSION OF IT. IS THAT BASED ON SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TO YOU?  OR IS THAT AN AMALGAM OF VARIOUS BATH PRODUCTS YOU HAVE HAD OVER THE YEARS?  BECAUSE.
I HAD A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH A LUFFA FOR A WHILE.
Colbert: ARE YOU DESCRIBING YOURSELF THERE?
THIS IS A PARTICULAR BAR OF SOAP.
Colbert: YEAH.
A PARTICULAR INCIDENT AND I FELT AN AFFECTION I COULDN'T EXPLAIN EXCEPT IN POETRY.
THERE IS A SHOW ON TELEVISION THAT ACTUALLY READS POETRY ON THE AIR.
Colbert: UNHEARD OF.
NOT SINCE JANUARY PARR.
JACK PARR I WOULD LOVE TO READ A POEM OF YOURS.
WOULD YOU? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: I LIKE THIS ONE. I LIKE THIS ONE. HER READ A VERSE AND YOU READ A VERSE. THIS ONE GOES, THIS IS PAGE 189, TO MY FAVORITE 17-YEAR-OLD HIGH SCHOOL GIRL.
OKAY.
Colbert:LY START AND YOU GO.
OKAY.
Colbert: DO YOU REALIZE THAT IF YOU HAD STARTED BUILDING A PART NONON THE DAY YOU WERE, PARTHENON YOU WOULD BE DONE IN ONLY ONE MORE YEAR, OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ALONE, SO NEVER MIND, YOU ARE FINE JUST AS YOU ARE, YOU ARE LOVED SIMPLY FOR BEING YOURSELF. .. BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT AT YOUR AGE JUDY GARLAND WAS PULLING DOWN $150,000 A PICTURE?  JOAN OF ARC WAS LEADING THE FRENCH ARMY TO VICTORY AND PASCUAL HAD CLEANED UP HIS ROOM, NO, I MEAN HE INVENTED THE CALCULATOR.
OF COURSE, THERE WILL BE TIMES FOR ALL OF THAT LATER IN YOUR LIFE AFTER YOU COME OUT OF YOUR ROOM AND BEGIN TO BLOSSOM, OR AT LEAST PICK UP ALL OF YOUR SOCKS.
FOR SOME REASON I KEEP REMEMBERING LADY JANE GRAY WAS QUEEN OF ENGLAND WHEN SHE WAS ONLY 15. BUT THEN SHE WAS BEHEAD SOD NEVER MIND HER AS WELL AS A ROLE MODEL.
Colbert: A FEW CENTURIES LATER WHEN HE WAS YOUR AGE FRANZ SCHUBERT WAS DOING THE DISHES FOR HIS FAMILY, THAT DID NOT KEEP HIM FROM COMPLETING SYMPHONIES AND MUCH MORE AS A YOUNGSTER.
HER SIMILAR IS NOT HERE IN THE SUBURBS OF CLEVELAND.
Colbert: FRANKLY, WHO CARES IF ANNIE OAKLEY WAS A CRACK SHOT AT 15 OR MAYA DEBUTED AT TOFSKA AT 17, WE THINK YOU ARE SPECIAL JUST BEING YOU, PLAYING WITH YOUR FOOD AND STARING INTO SPACE. BY THE WAY, I LIED ABOUT SCHUBERT DOING THE DISHES. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE NEVER HELPED OUT AROUND THE HOUSE. A. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: BILLY COLLINS. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK!
