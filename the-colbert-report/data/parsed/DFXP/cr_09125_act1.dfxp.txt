Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ALL RIGHT, SIT DOWN. NATION, TODAY MARKS THE 25th  DAY THAT NSA LEAKER EDWARD  SNOWDEN HAS BEEN HOLED UP IN THE MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL  AIRPORT. HE HAS BEEN THERE SO LONG HE  HAS FINISHED HIS SECOND  CINNABON. (LAUGHTER)  AND NOW, FOLKS, WE MAY NEVER  GET OUR HANDS ON THIS  TRAITER BECAUSE HE HAS OFFICIALLY PETITIONED RUSSIA  FOR ASYLUM. OF COURSE RUSSIA WAS HIS  FALLBACK. HE COULDN'T GET ASYLUM IN  ECUADOR OR DARTMOUTH. (LAUGHTER)  BUT ONE SENATOR KNOWS HOW TO  PUT THE SCREWS TO THE RUSS  KEYES.
REPUBLICAN SENATOR  LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS THE  UNITED STATES SHOULD  CONSIDER BOYCOTTING THE GAMES IF RUSSIA GIVES THE  NSA LEAKER ASYLUM.
I LOVE THE OLYMPICS BUT I  HATE WHAT THE RUSSIAN  GOVERNMENT IS DOING  THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. IF THEY GIVE ASYLUM TO A  PERSON WHO I BELIEVE HAS  COMMITTED TREASON AGAINST  THE UNITED STATES, THAT'S TAKING TO A NEW LEVEL. IF YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME  WOULD YOU HAVE ALLOWED ADOLF  HITLER TO HOST THE OLYMPICS IN GERMANY?
Stephen: YES, YES, GOOD  POINT. IF YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME  AND STOP HITLER FROM DOING  ANYTHING--   (LAUGHTER)
IT WOULD SURELY BE  HOSTING THE 1936 BERLIN  GAMES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NO, THAT IS WITHOUT QUESTION  MY NUMBER ONE HITLER RELATED TIME TRAVEL FANTASY. IN FACT, FOLKS, I WROTE A  SPECULATIVE FICTION NOVEL ON  THIS VERY SUBJECT ENTITLED OPERATION JAVELIN. IN WHICH A TIME  TRAVELINGEOUSIE OWENS NOW  TRAINED AS A SNIPER. GOES BACK TO THE CRITICAL  MOMENT WHERE HITLER IS ABOUT  TO SIGN HIS CONTRACT WITH THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE,  RAISES HIS LIFE EL AND  SHOOTS THE PEN RIGHT OUT OF  HITLER'S HAND. NOW OBVIOUSLY IN THE BOOK  HITLER GOES ON TO STILL DO  THE OTHER STUFF BUT--   (LAUGHTER)
BUT HE NEVER GETS OVER  THE STING OF SEEING THE  OLYMPIC ITS MOVE TO  BALTIMORE. THAT'S JUSTICE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  POINT IS-- THE POINT IS  RUSSIA TURNED OVER SNOWDEN  SHALL THIS IS YOUR LAST  WARNING. BUT FOLKS HAD THERE IS SOME  GOOD NEWS OUT THERE. WE'VE GOT ANOTHER POLITICAL  SEX SCANDAL. THIS TIME, THIS TIME  INVOLVING SAN DIEGO MAYOR  BOB FILLNER. SHOCKING, I KNOW. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT  CHICKEN WAS THE MAYOR. (LAUGHTER)  JIM, LET'S HEAR THE GOREY  DETAILS.
KISSING, GROPING, LEWD  COMMENTS, SEXUAL HARASSMENT,  THOSE ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST LONG TIME LIBERAL  DEMOCRAT, FORMER CONGRESSMAN  AND CURRENT MAYOR OF SAN DIEGO BOB FILLNER.
IT'S ALLEGED COWORKERS  HAVE COINED SPECIFIC TERMS  LIKE HIM LIKE DIRTY OLD MAN AND ALSO REFER TO ONE OF HIS  ALLEGED MOs AS THE QUOTE  STILLNER HEAD LOCK.
OFTENTIMES PULLING CLOSE  TO THEIR FACE AND TELL THEM  YOU'RE WONDERFUL. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL, I WANT TO  KISS YOU.
AND ALLEGEDLY WHEN A  WOMAN TRIES TO EVADE THE  MAYOR'S ADVANCES, COWORKERS REFER TO IT AS QUOTE THE  FILNER DANCE.
Stephen: YES, THE FILNER  DANCE. BECAUSE SEXUALLY HARASSING  PEOPLE GANGNAM STYLE IS SO  2012. (LAUGHTER)  NOW--   (APPLAUSE)  I THINK I SEXUALLY HARASSED  MYSELF. NOW FILNER HAS ADDRESSED  THIS MATTER COMPLETELY WITH  AN INTERNET VIDEO.
I BEGIN TODAY BY  APOLOGIZING TO YOU. I HAVE DIMINISHED THE OFFICE  TO WHICH YOU ELECTED ME. I'M CLEARLY DOING SOMETHING  WRONG. AND I HAVE REACH MOOD MY  HEART AND SOUL AND REALIZED  I MUST AND WILL CHANGE MY  BEHAVIOR.
Stephen: SEE? THIS MAN REACHES INTO  HEARTSnd SOULS, AND IT'S NOT  HIS FAULT IF SOMETIMES THERE ARE TITTIES IN THE WAY. (LAUGHTER)  IT HAPPENS. (APPLAUSE)  NOW DESPITE HIS ADMISSION,  MAYOR FILNER HAS ANNOUNCED  WILL NOT RESIGN. AND FOLKS I'M NOT SURPRISED. THESE DAYS THE PUBLIC IS  VERY FORGIVING OF  POLITICIANS AND SEX SCANDALS,  MARK SANFORD HAS BEEN RE-ELECTED TO CONGRESS AND  RIGHT NOW IN NEW YORK CITY'S  MAYORRAL RACE, CITY COUNCIL SPEAKER CHRISTINE QUINN AND  FORMER PENIS  SELF-PORTRAITIST ANTHONY  WEINER ARE RUNNING NECK AND WHAT I HOPE IS HIS NECK. NOW NO SURPRISE, FOLKS, NO  SURPRISE NEW YORKERS ARE  WILLING TO OVERLOOK WEINER'S PREVIOUS INDISCRETIONS. I MEAN IF THEY WERE  DISTURBED BY SEEING EXPOSED  GENITAL THOSE ONE WOULD RIDE  THE SUBWAY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY  THIS WEEK IS THE POLITICAL  COMEBACK OF FORMER NEW YORK GOVERNOR AND REGISTERED LIP  DONOR ELIOT SPITZER. JIM?
IN THE RACE, FORMER  GOVERNOR ELIOT SPITZER  BARELY HAS BEEN IN THE RACE FOR A WEEK AND ALREADY HE'S  LEADING MANHATTAN BOROUGH  PRESIDENT SCOTT STRINGER  48-33 PERCENT.
Stephen: YES, ELIOT  SPITZER COULD VERY WELL BE  NEW YORK'S NEXT COMPTROLLER. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT  THAT MEANS? I DON'T. BECAUSE WHAT THE HELL IS A  COMPTROLLER? HERE TO TELL US IS CANDIDATE  FOR NEW YORK CITY  COMPTROLLER ELIOT SPITZER. ELLIOTT, THANK YOU FOR  COMING. GOOD TO SEE YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
Stephen: OKAY, ELLIOTT,  YOU ALSO GOT A BOOK HERE.
I DO.
Stephen: IT'S CALL  PRODUCT TECTING CAPITALISM  CASE BY CASE. WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER.
CAN WE DO THAT NOW.
Stephen: ELLIOTT.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: WHAT IS A  COMPTROLLER. WHAT DOES A COMPTROLLER DO.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING  TO TELL ME. THAT'S WHY I SHOWED UP. THIS IS ACTUALLY A HUGELY  IMPORTANT POSITION. YOU CONTROL OR HAVE A SAY IN  THE INVESTMENT OF OVER 140  BILLION DOLLARS OF PENSION DOLLARS THAT ARE THE  PENSIONS FOR FORMING  MUNICIPAL WORMER-- WORKERS,  YOU SEE OVERTHE THE BUDGET, YOU SEE THAT THE TAX DOLLARS  ARE USED FOR THE  PURPOSE-- YOU SEEM SO INTENT  IN LISTENING.
Stephen: NO, I DO, IT'S  GOOD TO KNOW. GIVEN A POSITION OF THIS  RESPONSIBILITY, SHOULDN'T  THE JOB OF COMPTROLLER GO TO SOMEONE WHO HAS SHOWN A  MODICUM OF SELF-COMPTROL. (APPLAUSE)
YOU ARE RIGHT.
Stephen: WHY-- WHY, WHY  SHOULD, WHY SHOULD THE  PEOPLE TRUST NEW.
BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF  THE RECORD. MANY YEARS AS ATTORNEY  GENERAL, DOING THINGS WITH  RESPECT TO CAPITAL MARKETS  THAT RELATE DIRECTLY TO THE OFFICE OF COMPTROLLER.
Stephen: ATTACKING WALL  STREET.
WELL, ATTACKING,  REGULATING IT SO IT WAS  HONEST AND FAIR AND  TRANSPARENT. AND BACK IN 2000, 2001  LEADING TO THE CRISIS OF  2008 SAYING THERE ARE  STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS HERE THAT NOBODY WANTED TO ADMIT.
REGULATION IS THE WORD  YOU USED. YOU CAN'T BE PRO REGULATION  AND PRO CAPITALISM. CAPITALISM YOU HAVE TO CUT  THE STRINGS AND FLY, BABY  DOLL.
THAT IS SO LAST CENTURY.
Stephen: WHY?
HERE'S WHY. THE REALITY IS, OUR  UNDERSTANDING OF MARKETS WAS  FLAWED. MARKET DOES NOT WORK IF YOU  DON'T HAVE ANNUM PRIOR. YOU CANNOT LET THE LINESMAN  ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM CALL  THE HOLDING PENALTY. YOU CANNOT LETED WALL STREET  FIRMS GET AWAY WITH THIS  THING CALLED SELF-REGULATION T WILL LEAD TO ANOTHER  CATACLYSM.
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO  WITH THAT, THAT IS NOT THE  JOB OF THE COMPTROLLER WHY DOW WANT THIS JOB? BECAUSE BEFORE YOU HAD YOUR  FALL FROM GRACE OR WHATEVER  HER NAME WAS-- YOU--   (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: BEFORE YOU HAD  YOUR FALL FROM GRACE, YOU  WERE THE GOVERNOR OF THE  STATE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU WERE THE  GOVERNOR SLAFERP!. AREN'T YOU ONE AT THE SAME  TIME BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW  THIS JOB.
THAT'S WHY-- THAT'S WHY  I'M TRYING TO GET RIGHT IN  THE MIDDLE. HERE'S WHY. IN THE BOOK, WHICH YOU  KINDLY HELD UP.
Stephen: THERE IT IS.
I MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT  OWNERSHIP TRUMPS REGULATION. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, I  KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A  WONKY TYPE OF THING. YOU CAN'T REGULATION YOUR  WAY TO GOOD JUDGEMENT IN THE  CORPORATE BOARDROOMS. YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE YOUR WAY  TO GOOD JUDGEMENT, ONLY IF  THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE  COMPANY, AND THAT'S US, IT'S OUR MONEY, OUR PENSION  DOLLARS, OUR MUTUAL FUNDS,  ONLY IF THEY LISTEN TO  US-- .
Stephen: OKAY. BEFORE WE GO.
YES.
Stephen: BEFORE WE GO,  ONE LAST QUESTION, AND THAT  IS, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LEADING IN THE POLLS. YOU COULD WIN THIS THING. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WEINER  COULD WIN THIS THING, MARK  SANFORD HAD A COMEBACK. DO YOU THINK THAT IT SEEMS  THAT VOTERS ARE MORE  FORGIVING THAN THEY USED TO  BE? DO YOU THINK THAT SIGNALS  PROGRESS FOR OUR COUNTRY OR  THE SLOW DECAY OF OUR MORAL  VALUES? (LAUGHTER)
WOW. WOW. THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
Stephen: THIS EIGHT  CHARLIE ROSE MOTHER [BLEEP]. COME BACK AND TELL ME. COME BACK AND TELL ME. ELIOT SPITZER, CANDIDATE FOR  NEW YORK CITY COMPTROLLER.
