(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW FOLKS, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, FOLKS. THAT'S GREAT. BEFORE WE GET STARTED, I UNDERSTAND YOUR ENTHUSIASM, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DON'T GET ME WRONG, I UNDERSTAND. BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BEFORE WE GET STARTED I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY IN THE UKRAINE. EARLIER TODAY A MALAYSIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT CARRYING 295 PASSENGERS AND CREW CRASHED APPARENTLY BROUGHT DOWN BY A MISSILE. IT IS AN UNTHINKABLE LOSS AND OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH EVERYONE AFFECTED BY THIS SENSELESS ACT. AND THERE IS MORE TROUBLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER TEN DAYS OF TRADING MISSILE LAUNCHES EARLIER TODAY THERE WAS A BRIEF TALK OF A CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS. THAT BROKE DOWN AS BOTH SIDES COULD AGREE ON THE FIRE PART, NOT SO OF THE CEASE. (LAUGHTER) AND NOW ISRAEL HAS SENT GROUND TROOPS INTO GAZA. THIS MAY SOUND FAMILIAR. BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST GAZA WAR IN THAT IT IS HAPPENING NOW. (LAUGHTER) AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW, I TAPED THIS SHOW EARLIER IN THE EVENING. SO WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THESE STORIES. BUT WE WILL HAVE COMPLETE COVERAGE OF BOTH OF THESE STORIES ON TOMORROW NIGHT'S SHOW AND I'M-- I'M BEING TOLD WE DO NOT HAVE A SHOW ON FRIDAY NIGHTS. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. OH THANK GOD. (LAUGHTER) THOSE ARE REALLY DEPRESSING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THOSE ARE REALLY DEPRESSING STORIES. LET'S TURN TO A LIGHTER STORY. CHILD REFUGEES. (LAUGHTER) NATION, I COME TO YOU TONIGHT WITH A HEAVY HEART AND A BLOATED LIVER. YOU SEE, I'VE BEEN DRINKING A LOT THINKING ABOUT THIS WAVE OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORS FLOODING INTO AMERICA, FLEEING HONDURAS, GUATEMALA AND I BELIEVE EL DIABLO. (LAUGHTER) SADLY, FOLKS, THESE KIDS CONTINUE TO STREAM IN OVER THE BORDER DESPITE OUR CLEARLY MARKED YOU MUST BE THIS TALL TO ENTER THE COUNTRY SIGN. THIS IS A CLEAR HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING HERE. I AM A HUMAN. I'M NOT A MONSTER. I CARE FOR THESE KIDS SO VERY PUBLICLY. (LAUGHTER) YES, I BELIEVE IN SECURING OUR BORDERS BUT SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE GUATEMALAN. (LAUGHTER) THEY'RE SMALL CHEERFUL PEOPLE. AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WEARING MY HEART ON MY TV SLEEVE.
I FEEL BAD, AS I SAID, IF I WAS IN SOUTH OR CENTRAL AMERICA, MEXICO I WOULD TRY TO GET HERE. IT'S NOT THE IMMIGRANT'S FAULT.
BROKEN HEARTED. WE ALL REALLY FEEL BAD FOR THESE KIDS.
I'VE BEEN IN CENTRAL AMERICA MANY TIMES. I HAVE A GUATEMALAN DAUGHTER, NOW AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. I SPEAK SPANISH. I LOVE THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Stephen: I TOO HAVE A DEEP LOVE FOR THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE. I MEAN THESE KIDS AREN'T JUST INVADING OUR COUNTRY, THEY'RE INVADING-- IN HERE. AND WITH OUR HEARTS FULL OF LOVE FOR THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE, IT'S CLEAR WHAT WE MUST DO --
FIRST THING YOU DO IS START DEPORTING PEOPLE, TO THE BY THE HUNDREDS, NOT BY THE DOZENS, BY THE THOUSANDS.
Stephen: IT'S UH -- (APPLAUSE) IT'S A TOUGH LOVE. (LAUGHTER) OR A VERY SOFT HATE. (LAUGHTER) BUT REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING, IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING LET IT GO. AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, SEND HEAVILY ARMED TROOPS TO SCARE IT AWAY. NOW SURE, LAST WEEK OBAMA DEPORTED 38 WOMEN AND CHILDREN BACK TO SAN PEDRO, HONDURAS, THE CITY WITH THE HIGHEST MURDER RATE IN THE WORLD. IT'S A GOOD START, DON'T GET ME WRONG. BUT 38 PEOPLE OUT OF 5200? I MEAN AT THAT RATE, FOLKS, WE WILL NOT GET THESE-- WE WILL NOT GET THESE IMMIGRANTS OUT OF HERE UNTIL-- WAIT A SECOND THIS CALCULATOR ISN'T IN SPANISH. (LAUGHTER) IT DOESN'T-- IT DOESN'T HAVE THE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE SPANISH ONES HAVE THAT UPSIDE DOWN PLUS SIGN. AND FOLKS, EVEN A TROOP SURGE CANNOT STOP THESE KIDS BECAUSE THEY ARE SURGING AT OUR TROOPS.
SO MANY OF THESE KIDS WHO APPROACH THE BORDER, THEY'RE LOOKING FOR BORDER AGENTS TO TURN THEMSELVES IN, SO THEY CAN START THIS NOW LENGTHY LEGAL PROCESS OF TRYING TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY.
THESE KIDS ARE TURNING THEMSELVES INTO THE TROOPS. THAT'S LIKE HAVING MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS AT THE BORDER.
Stephen: YEAH, IT'S LIKE HAVING CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS AT THE BORDER. THOUGH IF THEY'RE FROM COMCAST THOSE KIDS MIGHT BEG TO BE LET GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AND I SAY-- I SAY-- INSTEAD OF US SENDING TROOPS DOWN THERE, WE JUST DO WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF CANDY ON HALLOWEEN. LESS'S TURN OFF THE LIGHTS AND PRETEND AMERICA'S NOT HOME. (LAUGHTER) SO THE KIDS MOVE ON TO THE NEXT HOUSE, CANADA. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I HOPE THOSE KIDS LIKE PENNIES AND RAISINS. (LAUGHTER) BUT FOLKS, THE WORST PART OF THIS CRISIS IS WHERE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS DECIDED TO SEND SOME OF THESE ILLEGAL CHILDREN.
A VERY DISTURBING REPORT ABOUT HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY SPENDING MILLIONS OF YOUR HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS TO HOUSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AT A TEXAS HOTEL. PLANS TO PUT ILLEGALS UP INSIDE A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR RESORT HOTEL AND WE'RE PAYING FOR IT.
THE BEAUTIFUL PALM AIRE RESORT AND HOTEL IN McALLEN TEXAS OFFERING INDOOR, OUTDOOR POOLS, WIFI CABLE, SAUNA, STEAM, FITNESS CENTER.
IT'S GOT THREE POOLS, A TENNIS COURT, JACUZZI,  WIFI, WAS THAT AN APPROPRIATE PROPOSAL, DO YOU THINK, TO TRY AND HOUSE SOME OF THESE KIDS?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
OH, I AGREE. OH, LET'S ALL PAY FOR PABLO'S CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST. (LAUGHTER) I BET EVERY NIGHT ON THE PILLOW THEY LEAVE A MINT, A GREEN CARD AND IMMIGRATION PAPERS FOLDED INTO A SWAN. (LAUGHTER) JUST LISTEN, JUST LISTEN, THIS IS GOING TO SHOCK YOU. (APPLAUSE) THIS IS GOING TO SHOCK YOU. JUST LISTEN TO THESE ACTUAL REVIEWS OF THE PALM AIRE RESORT FROM TRIP ADVISOR. ONE STAR, TERRIBLE HOTEL. MOLD AND MUSTY. SUNKEN COACH, BROKEN HANDLE ON SHOWER. STAINED SHEETS. THE POOL WAS GREEN. THIS IS THE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN. I DISCOVERED LARGE COCKROACHES RIGHT AS I ENTERED THE ROOM. THAT'S RIGHT, THEY'RE EVEN GIVING THE KIDS PETS. (LAUGHTER) THE BOTTOM LINE-- BOTTOM LINE, WE LOVE THESE KIDS. AND THE WORST HOTEL IN THE WORLD IS STILL TOO GOOD FOR THEM. 'CAUSE THESE INNOCENT LOOKING CHILDREN ARE ANYTHING BUT.
I'M TELLING YOU YOUR SAFETY IS AT RISK AND YOU ARE IN DANGER.
THEY COULD BE MEMBERS OF GANGS, FOR ALL WE KNOW.
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE COMING FROM COUNTRIES WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF CRIME.
WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GETTING MORE THAN WE'VE EVER GOTTEN FROM COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS ISLAMIC TERRORISM.
Stephen: I THINK THAT MEANS THEY'RE ISLAMIC TERRORISTS. I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT, IT MAKES SENSE. CHILDREN TAKE NAPS IN THESE DETENTION FACILITIES. THEY'RE LITERALLY IN SLEEPER CELLS. (LAUGHTER) AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN I WANT TO POINT OUT, I'M NOT A MONSTER. MY HEART GOES OUT TO THESE CHILDREN. THEY'RE NOT ALL VICIOUS KILLERS. SOME OF THEM ARE MERELY FILTHY DISEASE CARRIERS.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT SURE OF THEIR HEALTH CARE STATUS. WE HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT TB AND MRSA.
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ALL DISEASES THEY HAVE.
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES, THEY WILL GIVE IT TO EVERYBODY ELSE.
GEORGIA REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN PHIL GINGREY IS RAISING HEALTH CONCERNS ABOUT THE CHILDREN AS WELL. IN A LETTER TO THE CENTERS TO DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION HE CITES CONCERNS ABOUT SWINE FLU, EBOLA VIRUS AN TUBERCULOSIS.
YES, ACTUAL DOCTOR AN REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN PHIL GINGREY SAYS THESE KIDS COULD BE CARRYING EBOLA. AND YES THAT VIRUS HAS NEVER APPEARED OUTSIDE OF AFRICA, BUT GINGREY MAY HAVE CAUGHT IT FROM AN ILLEGAL ALREADY BECAUSE I BELIEVE ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS IS BASELESS FEAR LEAKING OUT OF YOUR ASS. (LAUGHTER) BUT THANK GOD--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THANK GOD THAT PATRIOTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST THESE RABID-PLAGUED CHILDREN BEING SPREAD BY OBAMA LIKE FESTERING STOOL SAMPLES ACROSS THE PETRI DISH OF AMERICA. AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN, I LOVE THEM. (LAUGHTER) ONE SUCH PATRIOT IS ARIZONA REPUBLICAN   CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE AND HUMAN STUBBLE FARM ADAM KWASMAN WHO SHOWED UP WITH CAMERAS TO BLOCKADE BUSES OF ILLEGAL CHILDREN OUT OF PURE VIDEOTAPED CONCERN FOR THEIR WELL-BEING.
REPUBLICAN ADAM KWASMAN WAS IN AURICLE THIS MORNING IN PROTEST THE BUSING OF MIGRANTS TO THE SHELTER.
I WAS ABLE TO ACTUALLY SEE SOME OF THE CHILDREN IN THE BUSES, IN THE FEAR ON THEIR FACES. THIS IS NOT COMPASSION.
JUST ONE PROBLEM, THOSE WEREN'T MIGRANT CHILDREN ON THE YELLOW SCHOOL BUS. THEY WERE YMCA CAMPERS FROM THE MIRANA SCHOOL DISTRICT.
DID YOU KNOW THE BUS WAS YMCA KIDS?
THEY WERE SAD TOO. I APOLOGIZE.
DO NOT APOLOGIZE!
Stephen: DO NOT APOLOGIZE. (APPLAUSE) STAND STRONG. I FOR ONE NEVER TRUST CAMPERS. THINK ABOUT IT, THEY ARE SENT TO REMOTE LOCATIONS WHERE THEY ARE TRAINED TO USE DEADLY WEAPONS SO THEY CAN CAPTURE OUR FLAGS. VIGILANCE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
