Stehen: TONIGHT, A NEW PLAN  TO HELP OUR STUDENTS SUCCEED IN  SCHOOL. IF YOU ADD A VERTICAL LINE, YOU  CAN MAKE AN F INTO AN A! [LAUGHTER] THEN, A NEW BREAKTHROUGH IN  SOCIAL MEDIA. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO IGNORE YOUR  FRIENDS' VACATION PHOTOS TWICE  AS FAST. [LAUGHTER] AND MY GUEST, BENH ZEITLIN, IS  THE DIRECTOR OF THE OSCAR  NOMINATED "BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD."  HE'S ABOUT THE MEET THE BEAST OF  THE NORTHERN TAME. [LAUGHTER] A NEW POLL SAYS THAT FOX NEWS IS  BOTH THE MOST TRUSTED AND LEAST  TRUSTED NEWS NETWORK. SEE, THEY DO REPORT BOTH SIDES  OF THE STORY. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] HOW IS IT GOING? GOOD TO SEE YOU. WHAT HAVE I GOT HERE. ALL RIGHT. HEY, ALL RIGHT! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN!"] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. FOLKS, I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. WE ARE BATTENING DOWN THE  HATCHES HERE AT THE REPORT. I JUST WANT TO GET ALL MY  EQUIPMENT READY. I URGE -- I URGE ALL OF YOU TO  DO THE SAME -- OKAY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, I WANT YOU TO PREPARE  IF YOU ARE ANYWHERE FROM MAINE  TO NORTH DAKOTA TO SOUTH OHIO BECAUSE THE LARGEST BLIZZARD IN  DECADES IS POISED TO SWALLOW THE  NORTHEAST.
MASSIVE SNOWFALL, POWERFUL  WIND GUSTS, A MAJOR BLIZZARD IS  ABOUT TO HIT THE NORTHEAST.
A HISTORIC BLIZZARD COULD  DUMP UP TO 30 INCHES OF SNOW.
THERE ARE GOING TO BE  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STUCK ON THE  HIGHWAYS.
TRAVEL COULD BECOME NEARLY  IMPOSSIBLE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. SO PLEASE STAY OFF THE ROADS  UNLESS YOU HAVE SNOW TIRES,  SNOW CHAINS OR ONE OF THESE  THINGS. [LAUGHTER] BONUS, IF YOU GET STRANDED, YOU  CAN CUT IT OPEN AND CRAWL  INSIDE. [LAUGHTER] CAN'T DO THAT WITH A PRIUS. [LAUGHTER] WORST HIT WILL BE BOSTON WHICH  IS EXPECTING FIVE FOOT SNOW  DRIFTS. MY GOD. IF THAT HAPPENS TO NEW YORK, WE  WON'T FIND OUR MAYOR 'TIL  SPRING. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW THIS YEAR THE WEATHER  CHANNEL IS NAMING ALL THE WINTER  STORMS LIKE HURRICANES, MAKING THIS-- WINTER STORM NEMO. YES, NEMO. SO IF YOU GET SNOWED IN WITH  SOME YOUNG KIDS, JUST PUT ON A  DVD OF THE INCREDIBLES. IT'S A GREAT MOVIE. [LAUGHTER] VERY IMPORTANT, DON'T WAIT 'TIL  NEMO HITS. BE PROACTIVE. TONIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO  SALT YOUR DRIVEWAY, THEN SALT  YOUR MEATS, AND THEN SALT YOUR LOVED ONES, BECAUSE IF IT'S AS  BAD AS THEY SAY, THEY MAY SOON  BE YOUR MEATS. [LAUGHTER] WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T GO INTO  WORK TOMORROW, IT'S JUST TOO  DANGEROUS. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I KNOW I'M NOT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, MY STAFF IS, BUT AS A  BONUS, I'M LETTING THEM  TAKE HOME ALL THE FREE SNOW THEY  WANT. NATION, 2016 WILL BE HERE BEFORE  WE KNOW IT. THAT'S WHY REPUBLICANS NEED TO  START SEARCHING FOR THE PERFECT  CANDIDATE NOW. WHO WILL IT BE? JEB BUSH, HALF OF CHRIS  CHRISTIE, OR DO WE TRACK DOWN  THAT ZOLTAR MACHINE SO BOBBY JINDAL CAN MAKE A WISH TO GROW  BIG? [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, EXPERIENCE TELLS US  THAT THE BEST PLACE TO FIND A  WINNING CANDIDATE IS THE STATE  SENATE. JUST TWO YEARS BEFORE BARACK  OBAMA ANNOUNCED HIS PRESIDENTIAL  RUN, HE WAS A LOWLY STATE  SENATOR. MAKING STATE LEGISLATURES ARE  THE FARM TEAMS OF AMERICAN  POLITICS, WHICH BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF OUR  SOMETIMES-RUNNING SERIES: "MR. SMITH GOES TO THE STATE  LEGISLATURE, THEN LATER,  POSSIBLY WASHINGTON." [LAUGHTER] FIRST UP, TONIGHT TENNESSEE  STATE SENATOR AND LOST WEASLEY  BROTHER, STACEY CAMPFIELD. [LAUGHTER] I FIRST NOTICED CAMPFIELD WHEN  HE DEMONSTRATED HIS KNOWLEDGE OF  IMMUNOLOGY BY DECLARING THAT AIDS WAS CAUSED BY ONE GUY  SCREWING A MONKEY, IF I RECALL  CORRECTLY, AND THEN HAVING SEX WITH MEN. IT WAS AN AIRLINE PILOT IF I  RECALL. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YES, AND IF I RECALL, IT WAS  SHORTLY AFTER THAT THAT AIRLINES  STOPPED SERVING FREE COCKTAILS TO MONKEYS IN FIRST CLASS. PILOTS COULDN'T RESIST. [LAUGHTER] I'VE LONG-ADMIRED CAMPFIELD'S  HEROIC WORK PROTECTING OUR  STUDENTS' MORALS WITH HIS "DON'T SAY GAY" BILL-- WHICH PROPOSED  BANNING TEACHERS FROM DISCUSSING  HOMOSEXUALITY IN SCHOOL. YES, IF YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT  SOMETHING, IT GOES AWAY. FOR INSTANCE, SARAH PALIN. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE WE MISS YOU. [LAUGHTER] SADLY, THE "DON'T SAY GAY" BILL  WAS DEFEATED LAST SPRING. BUT CAMPFIELD IS BACK WITH  SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW.
TENNESSEE STATE SENATOR  STACEY CAMPFIELD HAS FILED THE  "CLASSROOM PROTECTION ACT". IT WOULD REQUIRE COUNSELORS TO  REPORT STUDENTS' CONVERSATIONS  ABOUT SEXUALITY TO PARENTS.
STATE SENATOR STACEY  CAMPFIELD SAYS IT'S RIDICULOUS  TO SAY WE SHOULD SHIELD PARENTS ABOUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT  THEIR KIDS' HOMOSEXUAL ACTIVITY.
Stephepn SEE? TOTALLY DIFFERENT. IT'S GONE FROM "DON'T SAY GAY"  TO "GA-AY!" [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NO EVIDENCE. NOW, I'M SURE THEY'LL WORK OUT  SOME SYSTEM TO INFORM PARENTS OF  THEIR CHILD'S HOMOSEXUALITY. MAYBE THE REPORT CARD. "LOOK MOM, I GOT THREE B'S AND A  GAY PLUS." [LAUGHTER] AND TEACHERS WILL HAVE A  FOOLPROOF WAY TO DETERMINE A  STUDENT'S SEXUAL PREFERENCE. IF ANY OF THE OTHER STUDENTS  CALL HIM A GAYWAD OR GAYBO. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE THOSE AREN'T TERMS  CHILDREN THROW AROUND CASUALLY. THEY ARE BASED ON HARD EVIDENCE  ONLY, LIKE SOMEONE HAVING THE  WRONG COLOR BACKPACK OR BEING THE NEW KID. [LAUGHTER] NATURALLY, THIS IDEA ISN'T TOO  POPULAR WITH THE SAME-SEX  HUGGERS OUT THERE. CAMPFIELD'S HAD SOME ANGRY EMAIL  EXCHANGES WITH HIS CONSTITUENTS. WHICH HE ADDRESSED ON THE LEAST  GAY OF ALL NEWS PROGRAMS: TMZ. [LAUGHTER] JIM?
WHAT ABOUT THE RESPONSE TO  THE, AH, CONSTITUENT?
YEAH, THAT PERSON IS A  WELL-KNOW HOMOSEXUAL ADVOCATE  AND THE BIGGEST BULLIES OUT THERE ARE REALLY-- IS REALLY THE  HOMOSEXUAL COMMUNITY. STEVE. OH, YEAH IT'S WELL KNOWN. HOMOSEXUALS ARE NOTORIOUS  BULLIES. MANY OF THEM SPEND THEIR TEENAGE  YEARS MERCILESSLY RAMMING THEIR  FACES INTO THE FOOTBALL TEAM'S  FISTS. [LAUGHTER] THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS  ISN'T ABOUT OSTRACIZING GAY  STUDENTS INTO A LIFE OF  LONELINESS. IT'S ALL ABOUT EDUCATION. WE'RE TEACHING CHILDREN,  ISOLATED BY THEIR IDENTITY,  THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO ADULT THEY CAN TRUST. [LAUGHTER] NEXT UP ON THE  M-S-G-T-T-S-L-T-L-P-W'S. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, I'M SICK OF MOOCHERS WHO  GET PAID TO SIT AROUND ALL DAY. AND SO ARE THESE EXPERTS WHO ARE  PAID TO SIT AROUND ALL DAY AND  COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MOOCHERS.
MORE AND MORE ABLE-BODIED  PEOPLE ARE BECOMING DEPENDENT  UPON THE GOVERNMENT THAN UPON THEMSELVES FOR THEIR  LIVELIHOODS.
IN '91, INDIVIDUALS IN 41  MILLION AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS WERE  RECEIVING SOME KIND OF  ENTITLEMENT. NOW THE NUMBER IS AN ASTOUNDING  107 MILLION AMERICANS, AN  INCREASE OF 161%. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
THE COUNTRY HAS BECOME  DEPENDENT, MORE PEOPLE RECEIVING  THE BENEFITS OF GOVERNMENT THAT THERE IS A LOT MORE PEOPLE WHO  WANT TO SUCK ON THE TEAT OF THE  STATE. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: TRUE. EVEN WORSE, IT FORCES US TO HEAR  CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER SAY "SUCK ON  THE TEAT." [GAGGING] [LAUGHTER] [GAGGING] [LAUGHTER] WELL, THANKFULLY ANOTHER GOP  STATE SENATOR SLASH POTENTIAL  PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL HAS A BOLD SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. AND SURPRISE: IT'S STACEY  CAMPFIELD! [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN, HE HAS SET  HIS SIGHTS ON THE FREELOADIEST  OF ALL AMERICA'S FREELOADERS:  CHILDREN.
A TENNESSEE STATE SENATOR  WANTS TO CUT WELFARE FUNDING FOR  PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN PERFORM POORLY IN SCHOOL.
LISTEN, IF YOUR KID IS  FAILING EVERY SINGLE CLASS  BECAUSE WHO KNOWS WHAT REASON, WE'RE GONNA STOP OR CUTBACK ON  THE AMOUNT OF STRAIGHT CASH  PAYMENTS. IF YOU WANT TO TALK MOTIVATION,  NOTHING MOTIVATES LIKE CASH.
Stephen: AND NOBODY KNOWS  THAT BETTER THAN A POLITICIAN. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, AND THESE WELFARE KIDS  ARE ROLLING IN IT. DID YOU KNOW THAT IN TENNESSEE,  THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT FOR A MOTHER  WITH TWO CHILDREN IS $185 A  MONTH? AND FEBRUARY ONLY HAS 28 DAYS! CHA-CHING! [LAUGHTER] SOMEBODY'S TURNING SOME SWEET  COIN ON BLACK HISTORY MONTH. [LAUGHTER] AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO  LOVES CAMPFIELD'S IDEA. OVER ON FOX AND FRIENDS, THE  BROWN HAIRED GUY WHO'S NOT STEVE  DOOCY WISHES THIS PLAN HAD BEEN IN PLACE WHEN HE WAS IN SCHOOL.
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO ME  IN KINDERGARDEN, I USED TO FAKE  ILLNESS CAUSE I COULDN'T RECOGNIZE MY NAME. I HAD TO HANG UP MY COAT IN MY  CUBBY HOLE WITH MY NAME ON IT,  BUT SINCE I COULDN'T RECOGNIZE MY NAME I JUST KEPT FAKING  ILLNESS. IF MY PARENTS HAD BEEN CRACKED  DOWN ON AND MONEY HAD BEEN TAKEN  FROM THEM THEY WOULD HAVE FIGURED OUT THE REAL REASON I  WAS FAKING. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: SADLY TO THIS DAY,  HE STILL DOESN'T RECOGNIZE HIS  NAME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE SIGNS HIS CHECKS WITH A  CARTOON PENIS. [LAUGHTER] SO I SAY, BRAVO, STATE SENATOR--  OR SHOULD I SAY FUTURE  PRESIDENT-- CAMPFIELD. THERE NO WAY YOUR EDUCATIONAL  IDEAS CAN FAIL. AND IF THEY DO, WE'LL TAKE AWAY  YOUR GOVERNMENT CHECK, GAYWAD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
