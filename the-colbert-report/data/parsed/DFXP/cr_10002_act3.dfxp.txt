Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT STARS IN THE MOVIE "KILL YOUR DARLINGS" ABOUT A YOUNG BEAT POET. I'LL PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND HIM MORE THAN I ACTUALLY DO. PLEASE WELCOME DANIEL RADCLIFFE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, DANIEL! GOOD TO SEE YOU. SIT DOWN!
THANK YOU!
Stephen: SUPER EXCITED TO HAVE YOU ON.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I'VE BEEN A FAN FOR A WHILE.
Stephen: I'VE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS SINCE YOU WERE JUST -- THE HEIGHT YOU ARE NOW, ACTUALLY.
EXACTLY. I WAS GOING TO SAY.
Stephen: I WAS EXPECTING A SPURT AT THE END AND IT NEVER CAME.
WEREN'T WE ALL.
Stephen: YOU STARRED IN THE EIGHT HARR ARY POTTER FILMS AND YOU'RE LIKE MAYBE ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT NOW YOU HAVE -- YOU BRANCHED OUT OF THE FILMS, YOU'VE DONE "EQUUS" YOU'VE DONE "HOW TO SUCK SNEED BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING." ARE YOU AFRAID OF BEING PIGEON HOLD AS A YOUNG ATTRACTIVE SUCCESSFUL DANCER WHO CAN ALSO SING AND DANCE? DOES THAT WORRY YOU TO BE PIGEON HOLED AS A TRIPLE THREAT?
THAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT. NO ONE WANTS TO BE THOUGHT OF AS THAT. I'M FLATTERED YOU'VE NOTICED ALL THE OTHER THINGS.
Stephen: I'M NOT SAYING I'M STALKING YOU. (LAUGHTER)
NO, NO. IT WOULD BE FINE IF YOU WERE, THOUGH, I WOULDN'T -- THAT WOULD BE OKAY.
Stephen: THAT'S VERY GENEROUS. SO FEW OF MY GUESTS SAY THAT. (LAUGHTER)
I THOUGHT I'D OFFER YOU TO OPPORTUNITY TO STALK ME. IT'S WHY I CAME HERE. I THOUGHT WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL. YOU REALLY STRETCHED IN THIS LATEST PROJECT. YOU'RE ACTUALLY PLAYING A -- ALAN GINSBURG.
YES, AS UNLIKELY AS THAT SOUNDS.
Stephen: EXACTLY. JIM, CAN WE PUT UP A PICTURE OF ALAN GINSBURG, PLEASE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) THAT'S ALAN GINSBURG RIGHT THERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: I SEE IT, I TOTALLY SEE IT. (APPLAUSE) FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHO ALAN GINSBURG IS, TELL THE FOLKS.
ALAN GINSBURG WAS PART OF THE BEAT GENERATION OF POETS WHICH IS A VERY INFLUENTIAL KIND OF SCHOOL OF MOVEMENT OF AMERICAN WRITERS IN THE 20th CENTURY. THAT KIND OF SCHOOL OF THOUGHT WAS THAT THEY COULD -- IT WAS QUITE A -- THEY TOOK EXCITEMENT IN THE NIHILISM OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND THE IDEA OF TEARING EVERYTHING DOWN THAT HAD GONE BEFORE AND STARTING FRESH LIKE THIS WAS YEAR ONE.
Stephen: THEY WERE ANTI-AMERICAN, REALLY. THEY WERE ANTI-AMERICAN. NO, THEY WERE! BECAUSE THEY WERE QUESTIONING THE MORAL AND SOCIAL ORDER WITH THEIR WORK.
BUT THAT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT? ISN'T IT GOOD TO QUESTION THINGS.
Stephen: NO, IT WASN'T! BECAUSE IT WAS THE 1950s. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. EISENHOWER, EVERYONE WAS STRAIGHT, WHITE, AND MALE. (LAUGHTER) AND THESE GUYS WERE QUESTIONING IT AND QUESTIONING THE BOMB! AND QUESTIONING AMERICA'S PLACE IN THE WORLD AND WHAT WE MEANT BY OUR SOCIETY.
Stephen: .
WELL, THIS FILM ALSO BRICKS INTO YOUR YOUR ASSERTION THAT EVERYONE. IN THIS ERA WAS STRAIGHT.
Stephen: THEY WERE. THEY WERE. THEY WERE. THEY WERE. YEAH. I THINK THE BEAT POETS INVENTED BEING GAY. (LAUGHTER)
UM -- I -- THEY CERTAINLY ENJOYED IT BUT -- (LAUGHTER). I DON'T -- I CERTAINLY DON'T -- THEY CAN CLAIM TO HAVE INVENTED IT. I'M AFRAID TO BREAK IT TO YOU. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: REALLY?
YES!
Stephen: SO, LIKE, THE DEPRESSION? THERE WERE --
THROUGH ALL THAT. I IMAGINE THAT'S HOW A LOT OF PEOPLE -- I IMAGINE IT PISS ADD LOT OF PEOPLE OFF.
Stephen: KEEP A STIFF UPPER LIP, AS THEY SAY. (LAUGHTER) LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. I NOTICED THAT A LOT OF ACTORS ARE ENGLISH PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) NOW, ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ACTORS, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO CUT THAT.
IT'S TRUE. STPHAOU WHY IS IT? IS IT AN ATTEMPT TO GET OVER THE SPEECH IMPEDIMENT. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE YOU DO AN AMERICAN ACCENT WITH THIS GUY, RIGHT?
YEAH. YEAH. NO, I CAN -- I'VE LEARNED TO SPEAK PROPERLY OVER HERE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE! WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU TALKING -- TALKING RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
HOW'S YOUR YATES? HAVE YOU READ "A VISION"?
NEVER HEARD OF IT.
OH, IT'S COMPLETELY BRILLIANT. AND IMPOSSIBLE. IF YOU SAID THAT LIFE IS ROUND, THEY WERE STUCK ON THIS WHEEL OF LIVING AND DYING AND ENDLESS CIRCLE UNTIL SOMEONE BREAKS IT. YOU WALKED IN HERE, YOU RUPTURE IT HAD PATTERN. BANG! THE WHOLE WORLD GETS WIDER. HOW DID YOU -- A REITERATION OF THEMES.
ARE YOU A WRITER? 6-
Stephen: WOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT WAS ALSO MY AMERICAN HAIR, YOU NOTICE IN THAT CLIP AS WELL.
Stephen: IT WAS, YEAH. (LAUGHTER) WHAT'S YOUR HOPE FOR AN AMERICAN ACCENT? WHAT DO YOU SAY TO GET YOU STARTED?
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DIDN'T -- I THINK BECAUSE I SPENT A LOT OF TIME AROUND AMERICANS GROWING UP ON THE "HARRY POTTER" SET MY KIND OF GENERIC AMERICAN ACCENT IS BASED ON CHRIS COLUMBUS WHO DIRECTED THE FIRST TWO FILMS. AND ALSO AS A KID IN ENGLAND YOU ARE KIND OF SUFFICIENT FUSED WITH AMERICAN CULTURE. LIKE IF I WAS PLAYING WITH SOLDIERS AS A KID OR ACTION PEOPLE I WOULD GIVE THEM AMERICAN ACCENTS.
Stephen: REALLY. (LAUGHS) REALLY? BECAUSE OUR ARMY KNOWS HOW TO KICK ASS?
WELL, TO BE HONEST, THERE IS A --
Stephen: (AS A TYPICAL AMERICAN) WE'VE GONE INTO IRAQ, IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE!
IS THAT YOU DOING AN ENGLISH PERSON DOING AN AMERICAN?
Stephen: THAT'S MY IMPRESSION OF AN ENGLISH PERSON DOING AN AMERICAN ACCENT. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE "HARRY POTTER" THING TOO MUCH HERE.
THAT'S FINE. DON'T WORRY.
Stephen: LEGALLY I HAVE TO -- AT ONE POINT I HAVE TO SAY "YOU'RE A WIZARD, HARRY." (LAUGHTER) THAT'S IT. I'M DONE. I'M DONE NOW. I'M DONE NOW. BECAUSE I'VE HAD -- I HAD ELIJAH WOOD SITTING IN THAT EXACT SAME SEAT.
BLOCKING YOUR VIEW THE EXACT SAME WAY.
Stephen: THE EXACT SAME HEIGHT. WE HAVE A MARK ON THE WALL. (LAUGHTER) AND DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TAKE ANYMORE A FIGHT? (LAUGHTER) DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TAKE ELIJAH WOOD IN A FIGHT?
I'M NOT CALLING HIM OUT OR ANYTHING. SO I DON'T -- YOU KNOW WHAT, YES! YES, I CAN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE THAT, ELIJAH? DANIEL RADCLIFFE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU!
Stephen: DANIEL RADCLIFFE, EVERYBODY. "KILL YOUR DARLINGS." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND
