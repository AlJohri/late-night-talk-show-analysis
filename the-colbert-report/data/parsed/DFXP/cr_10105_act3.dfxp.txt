(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS WHO PLAYS A RUSSIAN SPY ON THE AMERICANS. WHICH IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WOULD BE THE PERFECT COVER FOR AN ACTUAL RUSSIAN SPY. PLEASE WELCOME KERI RUSSELL. (APPLAUSE)
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON, GOOD TO SEE YOU, THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW AGAIN.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
PLEASURE.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN ON YOUR SHOW BEFORE BUT --
THAT WAS A TEST.
YOU PASSED. I HAD TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE THE REAL KERI RUSSELL AND NOT A SPY WITH A KERI RUSSELL MASK ON.
GOOD, GOOD, COOL.
YOU ARE SHE.
YES, YES DOSVEDONA. (LAUGHTER)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
NO I DON'T.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
NO I DON'T.
GOOD. YOU ARE AN AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS WHO FOLLOWED UP YOUR BREAKTHROUGH ON FELICITY WITH FILMS LIKE AUGUST RUSH, WAITRESS, ALL RIGHT. NOW YOU'RE IN THE FX SERIES THE AMERICANS WHICH FINISHES ITS SECOND SEASON ON MAY 21st. I HAVE A BEEF WITH YOU, ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.
THIS IS A COMPLICATED DEPICTION OF RUSSIAN SPIES.
OKAY.
THESE PEOPLE HAVE HOME LIVES AND THEIR OWN PATRIOTISM. AND THEY, YOU KNOW, KILL PEOPLE, OKAY. WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE DO YOU THINK THAT'S SENDING TO THE YOUTH OF AMERICA?
WELL, I MEAN I THINK THE SHOW IS TRYING TO REPRESENT, YOU KNOW, REAL PEOPLE IN A REAL WAY. AND THAT THERE IS NO REAL BLACK OR WHITE OR BAD OR GOOD. PEOPLE ARE COMPLICATED AND HAVE MANY-- EVIL EMPIRE, MR. GORBACHEV, TEAR DOWN THIS WALL. WHAT PART OF EVIL EMPIRE MR. GORBACHEV TEAR DOWN THIS WALL DID YOU NOT GET FROM THE 1980s.
I UNDERSTAND. WELL, I MEAN I THINK IT'S JUST OUR DEPICTION. IT'S OUR-- IT'S JOE WEISSBERG AND HIS DEPICTION OF, YOU KNOW, A SINGULAR STORY WITHIN THAT WORLD. HERE'S MY SECRETARY PROBLEM WITH YOU.
ALL RIGHT? OKAY.
YOU'RE A MOM RIGHT. YOU'RE A MOM.
OH WHAT HAPPENED THERE.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE MYSELF DECENT THAT'S WHAT SPIES CALL THE HONEY TRAP. WHAT IS THE HONEY TRAP BY THE WAY.
YOU'LL FIND OUT LATER.
COLBERT REPORT AFTER DARK.
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE THING, YOU'RE A MOM RIGHT, YOU GOT A COUPLE KIDS OF YOUR OWN.
YES, I DO.
OKAY. YOU'RE IN THE SERIES THE AMERICANS YOU'RE A MOM WHOSE'S ALSO A SEXY RUSSIAN SPY WHO IS STEALING STATE SECRETS AND HAVING SEX WITH PEOPLE ALL THE TIME. ISN'T THAT AN UNREALISTIC IMAGE FOR WOMEN TO HAVE TO LIVE UP TO? I MEAN IMAGINE YOUR OWN LIFE, HAVING TO TAKE THE KIDS TO LIKE SOCCER PRACTICE OR GYMBOREE AND IN BETWEEN YOU HAVE TO STEAL, YOU HAVE TO STEAL THE SUBMARINE PLANS. SOME NIGHTS YOU DON'T WANT TO STEAL THE PLANS, YOU JUST WANT TO STAY AT HOME AND WATCH CAKE BOSS.
YES, THAT'S TRUE, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.
YOUR CHARACTER CHANGES HER HAIR STYLE ALL THE TIME.
YEAH.
DID YOU LEARN NOTHING FROM FELICITY? YOU CHANGE YOUR HAIR STYLE AMERICA GETS VERY UPSET.
SO UPSET YOU ARE SO RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
LET'S-- WE HAVE A LITTLE CLIP HERE. THIS IS YOU AND YOUR SUPPOSED HUSBAND. YOU HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR LIKE 15 YEARS.
YEAH.
YOU'VE HAD KIDS TOGETHER BUT IT'S INDISTINCT HOW DEEP THIS RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.
YES.
BUT YOU CERTAINLY DO TALK LIKE A TROUBLED COUPLE.
GOOD. >
IN BED?
OUT LIKE A LIGHT. I DON'T THINK SHE SLEPT THE WHOLE TRIP.
IF SHE SAID ONE MORE THING ABOUT NONVIOLENT RESISTANCE I WAS GONNA PUNCH HER IN THE FACE.
AT LEAST SHE'S GOT SOME PASSION IN HER SHE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING GOOD.
SHE THINKS A CHURCH PASTOR BEING ARRESTED FOR LOITERING IS SOME KIND OF HERO.
I KNOW.
I WISH I COULD TELL HER ABOUT THE REAL HEROES. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SACRIFICING THEMSELVES FOR THIS WORLD, NOT SOME STUPID CHILDREN'S STORY ABOUT HEAVEN.
SOMEONE SACRIFICED THEMSELVES TODAY.
AND NOW I FEEL SYMPATHY FOR RUSSIANS. ARE YOU HAPPY?
YES, YES I AM.
DID YOU DO ANY RESEARCH INTO BECOME A RUSSIAN SPY. DID YOU DO A RIDEALONG WITH A SPY OR WITH A RUSSIAN?
I DID YOU KNOW, A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH. I READ SOME PUTIN'S BIOGRAPHY.
YOU READ A PUTIN BIOGRAPHY.
I DID. I WAS SORT OF INTRIGUED. HE'S FASCINATING FOR ME.
AS SOMEONE DOING THE SHOW, IS IT EXCITING FOR EVERYONE AT THE SHOW THAT PUTIN IS BRINGING IT BACK? DO YOU EVER SAY TO YOURSELF LIKE COME ON, INVADE POLAND, PAPA WANTS ANOTHER SEASON. IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC FOR YOU. EVERYTHING SHORT OF A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE WOULD BE POSITIVE FOR YOU.
BASICALLY, YES.
ONE OF THE CONSULTANTS ON YOUR SHOW, JOE WEISBERG, A  FORMER CIA OPERATIVE.
CORRECT.
HE ACTUALLY INCLUDES REAL SPY WORK IN THE SERIES. ARE YOU GIVING AWAY STATE SECRETS WITH THIS TV SHOW?
I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO BE APPROVED. OUR SCRIPTS ARE ALL READ BY THE CIA. AND --
I THINK ALL OF EVERYONE'S EVERYTHING IS READ BY THE CIA
FAIR, THAT'S FAIR.
JOIN THE CLUB.
THAT'S FAIR.
WELL, KERI RUSSELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
KERI RUSSELL, THE SHOW IS THE AMERICANS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
