Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS--   ( CHEERS ) FOLKS, IF YOU CHECK YOUR CALENDARS, THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT YESTERDAY WAS LABOR DAY MEANING IT'S BACK-TO-SCHOOL TIME. THE DAYS ARE GETTING SHORTER. THE AIR IS GETTING CRISPER, AND PARENTS ARE SHELLING OUT GOOD MONEY ON A NEW 5 SECONDS OF SUMMER BACKPACK, EVEN THOUGH THE ONE DIRECTION BACKPACK FROM LAST YEAR IS PERFECTLY GOOD, GODDAMN IT. I CANNOT TELL THEM APART. WHEN I WAS A KID, SCHOOL WAS HARD, STARTED AT THE CRACK OF DAWN AND HAD TO WALK UPHILL BOTH WAYS. BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY EXPECTED OF US IN M.C. ESCHER HIGH.  GO, FIGHTIN' FISH WITH BIRDS BETWEEN THEM! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BIG FANS OF M.C. ESCHER HIGH. TODAY, WE'VE GONE SOFT ON OUR KIDS. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE PROFESSIONAL BOO-BOO KISSERS AT THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS.
ONLY 13% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GET THE OPTIMAL AMOUNT OF SLEEP. THAT'S EIGHT AND A HALF TO NINE AND A HALF HOURS. THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS BELIEVES THIS CONTRIBUTES TO OBESITY, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND DEPRESSION.
THE NATION'S LARGEST PEDIATRICIAN GROUP SAYS DELAYING THE START OF MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL CLASSES TO 8:30 A.M. WOULD HELP TEENAGERS WITH THEIR HEALTH.
Stephen:  HOW WILL STARTING SCHOOL LATER BE GOOD FOR KIDS' HEALTH? THEY'LL MISS THE CAFETERIA BREAKFAST PIZZA. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PIZZA OF THE DAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ACCORDING TO THIS NEW POLICY, DELAYING START TIMES CAN IMPROVE STUDENTS' MOTIVATION IN CLASS AND MOOD. WELL, WHEN AMERICA'S LARGEST GROUP OF RESPECTED DOCTORS TELLS ME ALLOWING TEENS TO SLEEP IN CAN MAKE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE TO THEIR SCHOOL PERFORMANCE, I GOTTA SAY--  NICE TRY, KIDS. YOU ALMOST HAD ME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) USUALLY -- VERY CLOSE. USUALLY, YOUR FAKE NOTES HAVE A DOCTOR'S SIGNATURE. FOR THIS ONE, YOU MADE UP A WHOLE ACADEMY. NICELY DONE. WHAT'S NEXT, THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR THIGH BURN AWARENESS RECOMMENDS NO MORE ROPE CLIMBING IN GYM CLASS? YOU GET UP THAT ROPE, MISTER. IT BUILDS REAL-LIFE ROPE SKILLS. SO YOU HIGH SCHOOL KIDS-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO YOU HIGH SCHOOL KIDS DO NOT NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL LATER. YOU NEED TO GO TO BED EARLIER, BY WHICH I MEAN AFTER MIDNIGHT. STAY AWAKE. I'M STILL TALKING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
