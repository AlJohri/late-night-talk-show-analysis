Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A SHOW BUSINESS LEGEND. I'LL MAKE HER APOLOGIZE FOR HOW MUCH I CRIED AT THE END OF "BEACHES." PLEASE WELCOME BETTE MIDLER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). MISS MIDLER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. WHAT A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU ON HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen:  SINGER, ACTRESS--
COMIC.
Stephen:  COMEDIENNE-- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF.
SMALL, VERY THIN, ELDERLY, BUT I LOOK FABULOUS. WHAT CAN I SAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  YOU DO. YOU'VE WON-- YOU'VE WON THREE GRAMMIES, FOUR GOLDEN GLOBES, THREE EMMYS AND A TONY. AND YOU'RE HERE WITH AN INTERESTING PROJECT. IT'S A RE-ISSUE OF A BOOK THAT YOU ORIGINALLY WROTE AND PUT OUT IN 1980 CALLED "A VIEW FROM A BROAD."
UH-HUH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH. THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen:  WHY-- WHY RE-ISSUE A BOOK FROM ALMOST 35 YEARS AGO? AND CAN I DO THAT, TOO?
, OF COURSE, YOU CAN. IF YOU HAVE A BOOK YOU MAY RE-ISSUE. EVERYBODY RE-ISSUES STUFF NOWADAYS. THEY RE-ISSUE THEIR GREAT ALBUM, THEIR GREAT MOVIE. THE 40th ANNIVERSARY OF "BEACHES," OR WHATEVER THE HECK. SO I HAVE HAD-- IT WAS IN THE PILE. YOU KNOW HOW YOU HAVE THE LITTLE PILES ALL OVER THE HOUSE?
Stephen:  SURE.
AND YOU START TO TRY TO KEEP THEM IN ORDER EVERY NOW AND AGAIN. SO FOUND THIS IN THE PILE AND I READ IT, AND-- BUT THE VOICE OF IT IS SO DISARMING AND SO SWEET, NOT LIKE I AM NOWADAYS. I'M COVERED IN BARNICLES, I'M A CRONE. IT WAS NICE-- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A NICE YET IDEA-- THERE ARE TWO GENERATIONS BETWEEN THAT AND THIS AND THEY DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL. I THOUGHT, MAYBE YOU KNOW, MAYBE THEY'LL GET INTO-- I'M NOT JUST WINNIE FROM HOCUS-POCUS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WHEN YOU WENT BACK AND INTERESTED AND HEARD THAT VOICE OF THE YOUNGER YOU, WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF YOURSELF?
YOU KNOW, I WAS SO-- THERE WAS A SWEETNESS TO ME AND A NAIVETE, AND IT'S ALSO VERY, VERY FUNNY. I WAS FUNNY IN A VERY EFFORTLESS WAY, AND I REALLY LIKE THAT VOICE. I REALLY LIKE-- THERE'S A LITTLE EDGE OF CYNICISM, BUT IT'S ALSO-- THERE ARE SO MANY LIES IN IT!
Stephen:  REALLY.
IT'S SO FULL OF LIES THAT I-- IT'S A CONFECTION --
Stephen:  HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT ANNOTATING IT WITH JUST THE WORD "( BLEEP )" AT THE BOTTOM OF EACH PAGE.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE.
Stephen:  YOU SHOULD PUT OUT A TEACHER'S EDITION. THIS IS DESCRIBING A TOUR, A WORLD TOUR YOU DID IN 1978.
YES.
Stephen:  WERE THERE GROUPIES?
FOR WOMEN THERE ARE NO GROUPIES.
Stephen:  REALLY, NO?
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE SOUND CREW OR LIGHTING CREW. YOU GET YOUR PICK OF THEM.
Stephen:  REALLY?
SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE REALLY --
Stephen:  DID YOU PARADE THEM BY.
YOU CAN SEE HOW I PICKED MY BAND. I MADE THEM DROP TROU. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER, OF COURSE,.
Stephen:  THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE. I HAVE A LOVELY CREW HERE. ANY OF THESE GUYS WOULD BE HONORED. THERE IT IS. THERE IS A PICTURE--
HOW I CHOOSE MY BAND.
Stephen:  THAT'S ACTUALLY YOUR BAND WITHOUT ANY PANTS ON.
Stephen:  WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO YOUR YOUNGER SELF NOW IF YOU COULD TALK TO HER?
I WOULD SAY HANG ON. IT'S GOING TO BE A HELL OF A RIDE. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.
Stephen:  WOULD SHE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU? IS IT A TWO-WAY STREET, WHEN YOU RECAPTURE THAT VOICE BY READING ABOUT YOURSELF WHAT, DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD SAY TO YOU?
SHE WOULD PROBABLY SAY I'M TOUGH I CAN MAKE IT. INDEED, I DID. BUT IN A CAREER YOU HAVE YOUR UPS AND YOUR DOWNS. NOT FOR YOU, NOT FOR YOU.
Stephen:  IT'S BEEN ONE ROCKET RIDE TO HEAVEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I HAVE TO ADMIT, IT'S TRUE. I HAVE FOLLOWED YOU, AND IT IS TRUE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT. I SWEAR TO GOD. THE REST OF US HIT SNAGS ALL TIME, BUT NOT YOU.
Stephen:  WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE DIVINE? YOU ARE THE DIVINE MISS M.. AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS WHEN IT'S APPLIED TO YOU, "THE DIVINE?"
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S SO ODD-- YOU CAN TAKE IT IN TWO WAYS. I THOUGHT-- YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS A GIRL, I USED TO READ ALL THESE SORT OF VARIOUS GOSSIPY BOOKS AND PEOPLE WOULD GO AROUND SAYING,"YOU'RE SO DIVINE, DARLING. YOU'RE DIVINE." AND I THOUGHT THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN, BE DIVINE. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE GOD-LIKE QUALITY OF IT, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE REFERENCE TO THE SPIRITUALITY OF IT. AND REALLY THE TRUTH IS, IF YOU SAY YOU'RE DIVINE ENOUGH, YOU ACTUALLY DO BECOME RATHER GOD-LIKE, BUT IN FACT --
Stephen:  ISN'T THAT A BURDEN?
NO, NOT FOR ME. NOT FOR ME. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M ALWAYS STRUGGLING TO BE ONE WITH GOD. I'M ALWAYS STRUGGLING. YES, I AM, IT'S TRUE. IN FACT I TOLD MY DAUGHTER AND HUSBAND I WAS A MESSIAH. AND THEY BELIEVED ME.
Stephen:  THAT STORY OFTEN ENDS, YOU KNOW, KIND OF ROUGH.
VERY BADLY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  IT HAS A HAPPY ENDING, BUT IN BETWEEN, THERE'S A TROUGH.
YES, YES. I DO-- I'VE SEEN THE PICTURE. I SAW THE MOVIE.
Stephen:  YOU DESCRIBED YOURSELF AS SOMETHING OF A MISFIT. EVERYBODY LIKES YOU. HOW COULD YOU BE A MISFIT?
I WAS BORN IN HAWAII, AND I WAS BORN IN HAWAII IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY-- I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHEN. I WAS BORN IN HAWAII, AND IN THOSE DAYS, THE DAYS THAT I WAS GROWING UP, WHITE PEOPLE WERE CONSIDERED THE ENEMY. AND IF YOU WERE WHITE THEY CALLED YOU THINGS LIKE HOLLY CRAB OR ( BLEEP ) OR THIS OR THAT.
Stephen:  WHAT DOES HOWLY MEAN?
WHITE PERSON. FOLLOW ALONG, HONEY, FOLLOW ALONG. WHITE, WHITE.
Stephen:  I DON'T SPEAK ALOHA.
HAWLEY MEANS A FOREIGNER AND IT REFERS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE WHITE.
Stephen:  DID YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP A CHARACTER?
I DID, I REALLY DID. I DEVELOPED A LOT OF ARMOR IN THOSE DAYS. IT WAS OKAY. IT REALLY WAS OKAY. WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT I ACTUALLY COULD MAKE THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT HAPPY WITH ME LAUGH, THIS WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD FOR ME. AND, REALLY, I NEVER LOOKED BACK FROM THAT. THINGS CHANGED FOR ME ONE I LEARNED THAT I COULD MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH. AND THEN ONCE I WENT TO A HIGH SCHOOL WHERE THERE HAPPENED TO BE A FEW MORE WHITE PEOPLE THAN ME, SO I KNOW ABOUT DISCRIMINATION. I KNOW ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE I FELT IT. I KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT. AND MY DAD WAS FANTASTIC. MY DAD WAS LIKE EVERYBODY'S SWELL. EVERYBODY'S GREAT. IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT COLOR YOU WERE. IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT COLOR YOU WERE. HE WAS THE MOST TOLERANT MAN I EVER MET AND I THINK I GOT A LOT OF THAT FROM HIM.
Stephen:  HOW LONG DID YOU DO THIS CHARACTER THE DIVINE MIS"M"?
I'M STILL DOING IT. I SHOWED UP HERE, DIDN'T I? I HAVE BEEN DIVINE FOR ABOUT-- I STARTED OUT, I THINK SINCE 1967. I CLAIMED MYSELF DIVINE IN 1967, AND I NEVER CHANGED MY TUNE.
Stephen:  SO YOU CAN MAKE AN ENTIRE CAREER OF PLAYING A CHARACTER OF YOURSELF. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) BETTE MIDLER, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MY PLEASURE.
Stephen:  BETTE MIDLER, THE BOOK IS "A VIEW FROM A BROAD." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
