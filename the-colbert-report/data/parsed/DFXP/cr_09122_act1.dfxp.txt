Stephen: HEY, WELCOME,  EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! tephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US IN  HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE  WORLD. AND, FOLKS, GOOD TO HAVE ME WITH  US BECAUSE FOR THE LAST TWO  WEEKS I WAS ON VACATION AS YOU MIGHT HAVE GUESSED FROM THIS  SAVAGE TAN. I'M SO DARK THAT WHEN I TAKE MY  SHIRT OFF, YOU CAN BARELY SEE MY  VEINS AND ORGANS. NOW, IT LEAVES A LITTLE MORE TO  THE IMAGINATION. NOW, I WON'T BRAG ABOUT HOW I  SPENT MY VACATION, BUT LET'S  JUST SAY SOMEONE'S GOT THE INSIDE TRACK ON DEPUTY FINANCE  MINISTER OF EGYPT. OF COURSE BACK HERE IN THE  STATES, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  OBSESSED WITH THE GEORGE  ZIMMERMAN MURDER TRIAL. PEOPLE ARE TRACKING IT LIKE IT  WAS A BLACK TEENAGER IN A GATED  COMMUNITY. AND ON SATURDAY... I KNOW. PEOPLE ARE EXCITED. AND ON SATURDAY, WE GOT JUSTICE.
WE THE JURY FIND GEORGE  ZIMMERMAN NOT GUILTY.
FOLKS, THIS IS A VICTORY FOR  THE RULE OF LAW. IN THAT FLORIDA APPARENTLY NO  LONGER HAS RULES OR LAWS. NOW, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, OF  COURSE, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUT  THERE WAS SHOCKED BUT ONE MAN SAW THIS COMING. FOX NEWS LEGAL CORRESPONDENT AND  INVENTOR OF THE LIP-HOODIE,  GERALDO RIVERA.
IT'S A DARK NIGHT. A 6'2 "HOODIE-WEARING STRANGER  IS IN THE IMMEDIATE HOUSING  COMPLEX. HOW WOULD THE LADIES OF THAT  JURY HAVE REACTED? I SUBMIT THAT IF THEY WERE  ARMED, THEY WOULD HAVE SHOT AND  KILLED TRAYVON MARTIN A LOT SOONER THAN GEORGE ZIMMERMAN  DID.
Stephen: GREAT ANALYSIS, AND  IT PROVES THIS WAS A FAIR TRIAL. AS THE BILL OF RIGHTS CLEARLY  STATES, THE ACCUSED SHALL BE  TRIED BY A JURY OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE DONE... WHO WOULD  HAVE DONE THE MURDER FASTER. BUT, FOLKS, EVEN THOUGH JUSTICE  WAS SERVED THAT DID NOT STOP  SOME AMERICANS FROM RUDELY ACCEPTING IT BACK TO THE  KITCHEN, TAKING TO THE STREETS  TO PROTEST SO-CALLED RACIAL  INEQUALITY. KNOCK IT OFF! BECAUSE YES, AMERICA HAD RACIAL  INEQUALITY BUT BY MY LATEST  CALCULATIONS, IT'S EVIDENTLY... IT IS NOW A TIE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STICK WITH ME. STICK WITH ME. HERE'S HOW IT BREAKS DOWN. OBVIOUSLY ZIMMERMAN'S ACQUITTAL  IS SEEN AS A POINT FOR WHITE  PEOPLE. (DING). THEN AGAIN, O.J.'S ACQUITTAL WAS  ONE FOR BLACK PEOPLE. (DING). OBAMA, WITH TWO BLACK POINTS,  ONE FOR EACH ELECTION (DING,  DING). AND WHITES LOSE ONE POINT FOR  JOE BIDEN. (BUZZER) OF COURSE FOR THE  PREVIOUS 43 WHITE PRESIDENTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOR THE PREVIOUS 4 WHITE  PRESIDENTS, WHITE PEOPLE  ACCUMULATED ONE POINT. (DING) NOW, JAZZ CLEARLY A POINT  FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS. (DING). BUT WHITE PEOPLE GET A POINT FOR  SMOOTH JAZZ. (DING) NOW, CRUCIAL. IN THE CIVIL WAR, WHITE PEOPLE  GET ONE POINT FOR WINNING THE  FIGHT TO END SLAVERY. (DING) AND ANOTHER POINT FOR  LOSING THE FIGHT TO KEEP  SLAVERY. (DING). [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EVIDENTLY NO POINTS FOR BLACK  PEOPLE IN THAT ONE. ODD TIME TO SIT THINGS OUT. ANYWAY, AS YOU CAN SEE, AS YOU  CAN SEE, IT'S EVEN NOW. OKAY? SO WE CAN JUST STOP THIS WHOLE  RACIAL THING HERE. WHITE PEOPLE, STOP BEING SO  SCARED WHERE OF YOUNG BLACK MEN. AND YOUNG BLACK MEN, STOP BEING  SO SCARY. OKAY. TAKE SOME PERSONAL  RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOW WHITE  PEOPLE FEEL AROUND YOU. OKAY. LOSE THE HOODIES. WEAR SOMETHING NONTHREATENING. YOU KNOW WHAT? START BUYING YOUR CLOTHES  WHEREVER MARTIN LAWRENCE AND  TYLER PERRY SHOP. I MEAN, THEY LOOK HARMLESS. I MEAN, MADEA HAS ONLY BEEN TO  JAIL ONCE. FOLKS, IF THIS TRIAL PROVES  ANYTHING -- AND I'M NOT SURE IT  DOES BECAUSE THE PROSECUTION CERTAINLY COULDN'T -- IT'S THAT  AMERICA... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S THAT AMERICA HAS NO  PATIENCE FOR TRANSGRESSORS. WE PUNISH THEM HARSHLY, THOSE  WHO BREAK OUR STATE OR FEDERAL  LAWS GO TO JAIL WHILE THOSE WHO BREAK OUR MORAL LAWS GO INTO NEW  YORK CITY POLITICS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] RECENTLY, I FOUND ONE MAN WHO  POSES OUR COUNTRY'S GREATEST  THREAT. HE IS LIKE AL CAPONE MEETS THE  UNABOMBER STUFFED INSIDE  VOLDEMORT AND SMOTHERED IN A CREAMY CHARLES MANSON SAUCE. AND TONIGHT I DO MORE THAN JUST  BRING HIM TO JUSTICE. I BRING HIM TO BASIC CABLE. JIM?
AMERICA IS A GREAT NATION. BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF SACRED  TEXTS. BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND  THAT. THEY DEMAND WE EMBRACE THEIR  DEVIANT LIFESTYLE.
ARE YOU SAYING IT'S  PERVERTED? IT'S NOT THAT WAY. IT'S SOMETHING BEYOND YOUR  PREJUDICED POINT OF VIEW.
THIS MAN WANTS TO REDEFINE  TRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
I'M LYNN HARRELL, AND I'M A  CONCERT CELLIST.
AND LYNN HARRELL IS ONE OF  THE PEOPLE DESTROYING AMERICA.
HOW DARE YOU. FOR YEARS, CONCERT KREFLIST  LYNN HARRELL HAS FLOWN THE  GLOBE. ON A PLANE LIKE THAT ONE RIGHT  THERE. THAT'S A PLANE.
LONDON, PARIS, ROME, NEW  YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, ET CETERA,  ET CETERA, ET CETERA.
AND HE'S ALWAYS JOINED BY HIS  LIFE-TIME COMPANION.
MR. CELLO HARRELL. AND LYNN HARRELL DEMANDS HIS  PARTNER, MR. CELLO SIT IN A  CABIN SEAT. BUT ONE AIRLINE IS FIGHTING  BACK. THE MOST AMERICAN AIRLINE,  DELTA.
DELTA AIRLINES KICKED ME OUT  OF THEIR SKY MILES PROGRAM.
TELL THEM WHY, LYNN. I HAVE A CELLO. AND THEY CONFISCATED MILES FOR  MY CELLO. AND THEY PUNISHED ME FOR HAVING  A CELLO.
NO, LYNN, THEY PUNISHED YOU  FOR OPENING A FREQUENT FLYER  ACCOUNT FOR YOUR CELLO.
I DESERVED IT. DELTA NOTICED HE WAS DOING  THIS, REACHED OUT TO HIM AND  TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS AGAINST THE RULES. HE SHOULD NOT DO IT ANYMORE AND  HE DID.
GARY LEFT IS "THE" EXPERT AT  FREQUENT FLYER MILES. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SAY I'M THE  EXPERT AT FREQUENT FLYER MILES.
PEOPLE LIKE THIS. AS A SCHOLAR OF SKY MILES, GARY  LEFT BELIEVES IN TRADITIONAL  MEMBERSHIP.
I THINK IT'S BEYOND  INAPPROPRIATE TO SET-A SKY MILES  ACCOUNT IN A CELLO'S NAME BECAUSE SKY MILE ACCOUNTS ARE  FOUR HUMAN BEINGS.
SO TO GET RID OF HARRELL,  DELTA DID THE ONLY THING THEY  COULD. NO, BUT THAT IS COOL.
MY CO'S MILES WERE  CONFISCATED. I WAS ALSO CONFISCATED OF ALL  LYNN HARRELL MILES MYSELF  BECAUSE I'M THE TRAVELING  COMPANION. AND I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO  ENROLL IN ANY KIND OF DELTA SKY  MILES PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE.
AND THAT'S NO LAUGHING  MATTER. TELL THEM WHY, GARY.
THEY KICKED HIM OUT OF THE  PROGRAM. HE'S NO LONGER WELCOME.
BECAUSE SKY MILES ARE A  SACRED UNION BETWEEN ONE HUMAN  AND ONE AIRLINE. TRY TELLING THAT TO LYNN  HARRELL.
I DO NOT LIKE THAT BECAUSE I  THINK OF A CONCERT CELLO OF  BEING LIKE A FELLOW HUMAN BEING. I CALL IT A NAME AND I THINK  IT'S ALIVE AND LIVING AND  COMMUNICATES ABOUT DEEP  FEELINGS.
FEELINGS HE CAN'T KEEP TO  HIMSELF.
I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS  LARGE INSTRUMENT. IT'S BEEN THE GREATEST GIFT THAT  I'VE EVER RECEIVED.
OH, AND HE GIVES AS MUCH AS  HE RECEIVES.
I JUST ROMANTICIZE THE  RELATIONSHIP THAT I HAVE WITH  THIS BOX. THE VOICE IS THERE IN THE  INSTRUMENT WAITING TO BE  AWAKENED. I RUB MY HANDS OVER THE STRINGS  AND SUDDENLY IT'S ALIVE. THE CELLO HAS BEEN MY COMPANION  MY ENTIRE LIFE.
YES, HIS ONLY COMPANION. IF YOU DON'T COUNT HIS WIFE  ELLEN. ONCE AGAIN GARY LEFT.
DELTA TOLD HIM IT WAS AGAINST  THE RULES. IT WAS AGAINST THE RULES. I MEAN... AND I MEAN...
GO AHEAD, GARY. YOU GOT THIS.
THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS AGAINST  THE RULES. IT WAS AGAINST THE RULES.
GOT IT. AGAINST THE RULES. AND RULES ARE MEANT TO BE  FOLLOWED. EVEN IF SOMETIMES IT'S HARD. AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER  THAN GARY.
I START COLLECTING MILES IN A  SERIOUS WAY 16 YEARS AGO. OVER 20 YEARS AGO I WAS  TRAVELING A GOOD BIT EVEN TO  AUSTRALIA.
THAT'S WHEN HE STRAYED FROM  THE PROGRAM.
I'M EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT THAT  I LET MY MILES EXPIRE.
BUT GARY HAS COME AROUND AND  NOW HE'S IN A COMMITTED  RELATIONSHIP WITH DELTA SKY  MILES.
I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. I DO IT ALL THE TIME. I LOVE MY MILES.
AND THAT IS LOVE AS DELTA  INTENDED, NOT LYNN HARRELL'S  UNNATURAL MAN-ON-CELLO MILES  ACCOUNT. BUT NO SURPRISE LYNN SEES  HIMSELF AND HIS CELLO FELLOW HAS  THE VICTIMS.
I JUST WANT DELTA AND ALL THE  AIRLINES TO TREAT EACH AND EVERY  INDIVIDUAL EQUALLY NOT JUST HAVE LIP SERVICE TO IT. BUT WE'RE STILL IN THE STAGES  WHERE THERE'S DRINKING FOUNTAINS  FOR COLORED AND THERE'S DRINKING FOUNTAINS FOR WHITE ONLY. SOMETIMES I FEEL AS THOUGH I'M A  LITTLE VOICE IN THE FOREST  TRYING OUT BUT NOBODY IS  LISTENING.
OH, WE'RE LISTENING, LYNN. THAT'S HOW WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE  A PERSON DESTROYING AMERICA. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
