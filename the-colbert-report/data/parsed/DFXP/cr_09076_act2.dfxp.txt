[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, I'VE LONG WARNED THAT  AMERICA IS UNDER DIRE THREAT  FROM CREEPING SHARIA LAW. 'CUZ IT'S HERE. ALL OVER THE CITY I SEE WOMEN  CARRYING AROUND PRAYER MATS SO  THEY CAN PRAY TO MECCA. [LAUGHTER] THANKFULLY, BRAVE LEGISLATORS IN  29 STATES HAVE PASSED LAWS TO  STOP SHARIA IN MID-CREEP, INCLUDING TENNESSEE  WHERE,  DESPITE LAWMAKERS' BEST EFFORTS,  SHARIA HAS MANAGED TO WORK A CREEP-AROUND IN THE STATE  CAPITOL BUILDING MEN'S ROOM.
WHEN THE TENNESSEE STATE  CAPITOL UNDERWENT RENOVATIONS,  ONE SINK IN PARTICULAR BECAME THE SUBJECT OF CONTROVERSY. THE SENATE CLERK WAS APPROACHED  BY A NUMBER OF STATE LEGISLATORS  FEARFUL THAT THE NEW SINK WAS A MUSLIM FOOT BATH.
Stephen: OH YEAH, MUSLIMS ARE  ALWAYS WASHING THEIR FEET. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SO THEY'RE  PURE WHEN THEY PRAY, BUT WE ALL  KNOW: THE CLEANER THE FEET, THE SOFTER THE CREEP. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] SO DANGER AVERTED, RIGHT? WRONG! DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN,  TENNESSEE LAWMAKERS. BECAUSE WHAT IS A MOP SINK OTHER  THAN A MUSLIM MOP BATH? THINK ABOUT IT, A MOP IS NOTHING  BUT A BEARD ON A STICK, IT'S  OSAMA BIN MOPPIN'. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELL, NOW THAT WE HAVE THESE  SHARIA MOPS IN OUR CUSTODY, IT'S  TIME TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE UP TO. NOW FOLKS, THIS NEXT PART MIGHT  BE DISTURBING SO, HIT RECORD ON  YOUR TiVOs. [LAUGHTER] LET'S DO THIS THING. IF YOU SAW ZERO DARK THIRTY YOU  KNOW WHAT IS COMING, ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] GET READY TO TALK EXUM! COME ON! GET READY TO TALK SCUM. COME ON. WHO DO YOU WORK FOR? RIGHT THERE, COME ON. GAAAHH! HAVE YOU BEEN IN CONNECT WITH  HAVE YOU BEEN IN CONTACT WITH  AL-ZWAHIRI'S SWIFFER? ANSWER ME! NOTHING. ALL RIGHT, HAVE IT YOUR WAY. BUT I AM GONNA MOP THE FLOOR  WITH YOU,
