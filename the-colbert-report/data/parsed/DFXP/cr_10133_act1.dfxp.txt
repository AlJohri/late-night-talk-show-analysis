(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: RIGHT THERE?  ALL RIGHT. WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY, GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. FOLKS, IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE, WONDERFUL TO GET  THAT RESPONSE FROM THE AUDIENCE (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M SURPRISED. I'M NOT SURPRISED  AT ALL, FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR THAT GREETING. YOU KNOW I LOVE IT. YOU KNOW I NEED IT, BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED TO GET THAT KIND OF RESPONSE FROM AN AUDIENCE IN NEW YORK. I CAN'T EVER IMAGINE LEAVING THIS CITY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, AS YOU KNOW AS I HOPE YOU KNOW AMERICA CONTINUES TO FACE A BORDER CRISIS WITH THOUSANDS OF UNDOCUMENTED CENTRAL AMERICAN CHILDREN POURING OVER OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. AND PRESIDENT OBAMA STILL REJECTS MY PLAN TO BUILD A KID-APULT KIDS WILL LOVE IT, IT HAS GOT TO BE SAFER THAN THOSE CHAIN THINGS. FOLKS, IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE, WITH OVER 52,000 CHILDREN IN CUSTODY AND 90,000 EXPECTED BY THE END OF THE YEAR THAT IS A FLOOD. IT'S LIKE EL NINO IS RAINING ACTUAL NINOS. (LAUGHTER) AND NOW THAT THEY ARE HERE, I BELIEVE THAT'S WHY IT IS CALLED THAT. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE THE NAME COMES FROM. AND FOLKS, NOW THAT THE KIDS ARE HERE, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT PARTS OF AMERICA THEY'RE DESTROYING FIRST.
FEDS ARE SHIPPING ILLEGAL ALIENS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY  BUT NOT INFORMING THE STATES WHAT IS GOING ON.
THE WHITE HOUSE REFUSING TO SAY WHERE THEY WILL BE HOUSED ACROSS THE COUNTRY, APPARENTLY ILLEGAL PRIVACY, THEIR RIGHTS TRUMP AMERICA'S RIGHT TO KNOW.
Stephen: YES WHY WON'T THE WHITE HOUSE PUBLISH THE ADDRESSES OF THESE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS. COME ON. I MEAN THE KIDS COULD BE ANY WHERE. THEY COULD BE IN YOUR TOWN. THEY COULD BE IN YOUR HOUSE, HELL, THEY COULD BE IN MY HOUSE. COME TO THINK OF IT I'VE GOT KIDS AT MY HOUSE. AND I'M NOT SURE WHERE KIDS COME FROM. ALL I KNOW IS THEY SHOWED UP ONE DAY SLATHERED IN SOME KIND OF SALSA. AND DID NOT SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH. NOW I GOT TO FOOT THE BILL FOR THEIR SCHOOL AND THEIR HEALTH CARE. NOT FAIR. FOLKS, NOWHERE IS THIS PROBLEM MORE PRONOUNCED THAN IN MAINE, THE PLASTIC BIB STATE. BECAUSE OUT OF THE 52,000 CHILDREN IN FEDERAL CUSTODY, UNCLE SAM IS UNFAIRLY SADDLING MAINE WITH A WHOPPING 8 OF THEM. 8! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, THAT MEANS WHEN MAINE GOES OUT TO DINNER THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY NOW BE CHARGED WITH A 15% GRATUITY FOR PARTIES OF 8 OR MORE. THANKFULLY MAINE GOVERNOR AND MAN TRYING TO LOOK GRATEFUL FOR A CRAPPY GIFT PAUL LePAGE CAUGHT WIND OF THIS AND DECLARED WE CANNOT BECOME A STATE THAT ENCOURAGES ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. WE SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD IT. THAT'S RIGHT. MAINE CAN NOT AFFORD 8 KIDS. THEY NEED THAT MONEY TO SOLVE THE BACKLOG OF CRIMES COMMITTED EVER SINCE JESSICA FLETCHER MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED. I ASK YOU, WAS IT--MURDER? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO, IT WAS CANCELLED SHE WROTE. FOLKS, I NEVER REALIZED MAINE WAS IN SUCH DIRE FINANCIAL STRAITS. THEY'RE JUST ONE OCTOMAMA AWAY FROM BANKRUPTCY. I'M NO FAN OF CALIFORNIA. FIRST OF ALL THEY'VE GOT A GRIZZLY BEAR ON THEIR FLAG. WHY DON'T YOU JUST CUT TO THE CHASE, CALIFORNIA AND MAKE IT CHARLIE MANSON. AND TWO THINGS, CALIFORNIA IS THE STATE THAT GAVE AMERICA ITS TWO GREATEST PRESIDENTS RONALD REAGAN AND SECOND TERM RONALD REAGAN. BUT THESE DAYS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THESE DAYS, FOLKS, CALIFORNIA IS AN UNGOVERNABLE MESS.
CALIFORNIA IS AN ENTIRE STATE FILLED WITH CITIES EITHER CLEARLY FAILING OR ON THE VERGE OF DISASTER.
CALIFORNIA IS GOING BROKE. BUSINESSES ARE FLEEING THE STATE IN DROVES.
CALIFORNIA'S PRISON SYSTEM IS JUST AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE.
THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IS RANKED 46th IN AMERICA AND WE'RE NUMBER ONE IN POVERTY.
CALIFORNIA ABLAZE, THREE MORE FIRES BREAK OUT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.
YOU SEE THAT, EVEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN IS NOW BURNING THE STATE DOWN FOR THE INSURANCE MONEY. BUT FOLKS THERE IS A GREAT NEW PLAN. YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS. A GREAT NEW PLAN TO MAKE CALIFORNIA WHOLE AGAIN BY BREAKING IT APART.
A PETITION TO BREAK CALIFORNIA INTO SIX SEPARATE STATES HAS ATTRACTED OVER A MILLION SIGNATURES.
THE MEASURE TO BREAK IT INTO 6 STATE COULD BE HEADED TO 2016 BALLOT
Stephen: IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME THEY BREAK UP CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I WAS TIRED OF WAITING FOR THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT TO GET AROUND TO IT. IT'S BEEN PROMISING ME SINCE I WAS  A KID. THE DRIVE CALLS ITSELF SIX CALIFORNIAS AND THEY KNOW WHAT REALLY MAKES CALIFORNIA UNGOVERNABLE.
JUST THINK THERE ARE 38 MILLION CALIFORNIANS, BUT ONLY ONE GOVERNOR. HOW CAN THAT GOVERNOR LOOK OUT FOR ALL 38 MILLION OF US. HE IS TRYING. BUT THE STATE IS TOO BIG AND COMPLICATED TO GOVERN.
YEAH, IT'S JUST BIG AND COMPLICATED. I MEAN SO BIG, YOU KNOW, YOU-- YOU WANT ANOTHER DRINK? OH MY GOODNESS, BREAKING UP CALIFORNIA MAKES MY NOSE TICKLE. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. SIX CALIFORNIAS IS THE BRAINCHILD OF SILICON VALLEY BILLIONAIRE AND EVIL STEPFATHER IN A LIFETIME MOVIE TIM DRAPER. WHO CAME UP WITH THE PERFECT METAPHOR.
SIX CALIFORNIAS, GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO REBOOT AND REFRESH OUR STATE GOVERNMENT.
YES, IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO REBOOT. BUT JUST LIKE RESTARTING WINDOWS IT MIGHT TAKE A FEW YEARS. AND JUST CHECK OUT THE GREAT NEW STATE'S NAMES. THERE'S NORTH CALIFORNIA, SOUTH CALIFORNIA, CENTRAL CALIFORNIA, AND WEST CALIFORNIA HOME OF LOS ANGELES, WITH ITS VAST COLONIC CLEANSE AND CELEBRITY BABY STALKING INDUSTRIES. THEN THERE ARE TWO NEW STATES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE NAMES. JEFFERSON, FAMOUS FOR PRODUCING 60% OF THE NATION'S MARIJUANA AND EATING 60% OF THE NATION'S LEFTOVER BURRITOES. I BELIEVE JEFFERSON'S STATE FLAG WOULD BE A MAGIC EYE POSTER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S A BEAR.
LAST BUT ACTUALLY FIRST THERE'S THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA STATE, NATURALLY NAMED SILICON VALLEY. I SAY YOU CAN'T GO WRONG NAMING STUFF AFTER TECHNOLOGY, IT'S TIMELESS. JUST ASK THE RESIDENCE OF CB RADIO AND BETA MAX. (LAUGHTER) SILICON VALLEY (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE STATE OF SILICON VALLEY WOULD BE THE NATION'S RICHEST STATE PER CAPITA AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO SHARE THEIR WEALTH WITH CALIFORNIA OTHER POORER PER CAPITAS, SO I BELIEVE THEIR STATE BIRD WILL BE THIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: MEANWHILE THE NEIGHBORING STATE OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOULD BECOME THE POOREST STATE IN THE NATION SO, MAYBE INSTEAD OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA, A BETTER NAME WOULD BE  VERY WEST VIRGINIA. OF COURSE, IF THEY BREAK UP INTO SIX STATES THEY WOULD HAVE TO FIGURE SOME STUFF OUT. FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE TO WIN THE ELECTION THEN GET CONGRESS TO APPROVE IT. AND AFTER THAT THE ONLY QUESTION REMAINS IS WHO HAS TO KEEP MEL GIBSON. IT'S A ROCK SOLID PLAN THAT NEEDS NO FURTHER EXPLANATION. HERE TO EXPLAIN IT FURTHER IS THE ARCHITECT OF SIX CALIFORNIAS, PLEASE WELCOME TIM DRAPER. MR. DRAPER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I THINK YOU'VE EXPLAINED IT JUST PERFECTLY. YOU SAY CALIFORNIA CANNOT BE GOVERNED BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO GEOGRAPHICALLY LARGE AND DISPERSED, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Stephen: IS THAT WHY STATES LIKE RHODE ISLAND ARE SUCH PARADISES?
NO, BUT THEY DO HAVE A CHOICE IN RHODE ISLAND. THEY CAN DRIVE 20 MINUTES TO ANOTHER STATE.
OKAY YOU POINT OUT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS. ABYSSMAL K-12 EDUCATION, MASSIVE PRISON POPULATION, 20% LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. DO ALL THESE PROBLEM GOES AWAY WHEN THEY ARE DIVVIED UP AMONG SIX SEPARATE STATES.
WELL, HERE'S THE SITUATION THAT I LOOK AT. AND I'M ALWAYS LOOKING TO THE FUTURE. BECAUSE MY BUSINESS IS ALL ABOUT THE FUTURE, DRAPER UNIVERSITY OF HEROES IS ALL ABOUT CREATING ENTREPRENEURS
Stephen: SORRY, WHAT?
OH, I STARTED A COOL CALLED DRAPER UNIVERSITY OF HEROES.
Stephen: UH-HUH. IS THAT ANYTHING LIKE THE LITTLE LEBOWSKI ACHIEVERS.
YEAH, BUT THEY ARE A LITTLE OLDER. ANYWAY ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT I HAVE DONE IN MY CAREER HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PROJECTING OUT AND LOOKING AT THE FUTURE. I USE THE PAST AND DETERMINE WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. AND BASED ON THE PAST CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE LOOKS REALLY BAD.
PAST PERFORMANCE TENDS TO INDICATE FUTURE RESULTS.  PLEASE DO READ THE PROSPECTUS
SO 40 YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA WAS GREAT. IT WAS THE BEST-- FIRST IT'S STILL GREAT, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE A LOT OF GREAT WEATHER.
Stephen: FOR NOW, UNTIL IT'S BUSTED UP BY SOME GUY PRETTY SOON.
SO 40 YEARS AGO WE WERE THE BEST. WE HAD THE BEST EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY. WE HAD THE BEST ECONOMY IN THE COUNTRY, BEST ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN THE COUNTRY.
WHAT HAPPENED.
40 YEARS LATER.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED.
WAS IT JERRY BROWN COMING BACK.
NO, ACTUALLY THERE HAVE BEEN GOOD PEOPLE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THERE HAVE BEEN GOOD PEOPLE MANAGING THAT STATE, FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.
BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE STATE.
BUT VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE ALL THE DIFFERENT INTERESTS.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOUR IDEA, BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF A WHOLE IDEA OF A MELTING POT, AMERICA. I BELIEVE THE METAPHOR, A METAPHOR ARE YOU GOING FOR IS ONE OF THOSE TUPPERWARE THINGS WHERE YOU GET TO SEAL OFF EVERY CONTAINER. AND EVERYONE'S INTERESTS STAY FRESH.
OKAY, CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.
IT WILL BE A GREAT MELTING POT.
DO YOU THINK THIS WILL HAPPEN TO OTHER STATES BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG STORY, BECAUSE IT WILL BE LIKE A PROPOSITION ON THE BALLOT IN 2016.
RIGHT.
DO YOU THINK THAT THESE EVENTUAL OTHER STATES DO YOU THINK THE OTHER STATES WILL KEEP CALIFORNIA'S INSANE PROPOSITION SYSTEM WHERE ANYONE CAN GET SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT?
DO YOU THINK ONE OF THEM WILL GET RID OF THAT INSANE IDEA.
IF NOTHING ELSE THIS WILL STOP THAT.
ARE YOU GOING TO BE A SENATOR FOR ONE OF THESE NEW STATES OR GOVERNOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
NO, NO I'M LEAVING IT UP TO CALIFORNIANS.
YOU ARE JUST GOING TO SET CHARGE AND BLOW IT APART AND SAY NOT MY [BLEEP] PROBLEM. THANKS VERY MUCH. TIMOTHY DRAPER, SIT DOWN. SIX CALIFORNIAS, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
