I KNOW THAT YOU BOUGHT ONE BECAUSE ARE YOU JUST RIGHT IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC.
ABSOLUTELY.
I HAVE WOMANLY HIPS. NOW BOY, 10 MILLION COPIES. NO PROBLEM EATING THESE DAYS.
OR LOVING.
REALLY, REALLY?
BUT NO-- BUT NO PRAYING.
NO, PRAYERS OF GRATITUDE.
OKAY, GOOD.
YEAH, GOOD. NOW YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS. IS LIKE AN EAT PRAY LOVE ELECTRIC BOOG A LOO.
IT.
I KIND OF WROTE THE SEQUEL ALREADY BECAUSE RIGHT AFTER EAT, PRAY LOVE I WROTE THIS BOOK CALLED COMMITTED WHICH IS ABOUT GETTING MARRIED. AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS ENOUGH ABOUT ME, I THINK WE COULD ALL AGREE.
Stephen: I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY.
ABOUT ME OR ABOUT YOU.
Stephen: ABOUT ME, ACTUALLY.
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT ME? BUT I DECIDED TO GO BACK TO FICTION WHICH IS WHERE I GOT MY START AND I WANTED TO WRITE THE KIND OF BOOK THAT I ALWAYS LOVED TO READ. A BIG GIANT DEKENSIAN EPIC NOVEL OF IDEAS WITH ACTION, ADVENTURE ON THE HIGH SEAS.
SO THIS IS ANOTHER BOOK ABOUT A WOMAN IN THE 19th CENTURY. WHAT IS SHE-- SHE IS A POLITE-- SHE'S CALLED A POLITE-- WHICH IS WHAT THEY CALLED WOMEN WHO DEBOTANIST TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM A MAN.
WHY MAKE HER A BOT ANNIS IN THE 19th CENTURY. FOR A WOMAN IN THE 19th CENTURY WOULDN'T A MORE REALISTIC OCCUPATION BE DYING IN CHILDBIRTH?
PROFESSIONAL BLEEDING OUT WOMAN, YEAH. UNFORTUNATELY, YES, HOWEVER THERE WERE AN AMAZING NUMBER OF FEMALE BOT ANNISES. IT WAS THE ONLY SCIENCE THAT WOMEN WERE A LITTLE BIT WELCOMED IN TO BECAUSE FLOWERS.
Stephen: OH, FLOWERS ARE GIRLS.
THEY KIND OF-- THE WORLD OF PLANTS IS REALLY BORING TO WOMEN SO WOMEN KIND OF SNUCK INTO THAT WORLD OF GARDENING AND ONCE THEY WERE IN THERE THEY MADE AMAZING CONTRIBUTION, SO I WANTED TO WRITE ABOUT ONE OF THOSE WOMEN.
Stephen: IS THERE-- SENSE THERE SEXY TIMES IN THIS BOOK.
YEAH.
Stephen: REAL SEXY TIMES OR JUST PISTOLS AND STAMMENS.
FLOWERS THEY SAY ARE SEX MADE EVIDENCE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK VERY CARE FLOE AT AN ORCHID OR GEORGIA O'KEEFFE PAINTING TO GET-- .
Stephen: WOW, SHOULD I PIXEL ATE MY ROSE GARDEN.
CROSS POLLINATE.
Stephen: I DO, BABY.
I THINK-- VERY SEXY TIME. SHE IS A WOMAN OF GREAT PASSION AND DESIRE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I WANTED TO DO BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE AS A CONTEMPORARY REQUIRE WRITING ABOUT THE 19th CENTURY I CAN DO LIKE THE BRONTES AND JANE AUSTEN AND ELLIOTT COULD ONLY HINT AT. I CAN ACTUALLY SAY WHAT HAPPENS.
ALL RIGHT WHAT DOES HAPPEN? I MEAN WITHOUT GIVING EVERYTHING AWAY, DOES MR. DARCY COME IN AND THEN TAKE HER AWAY AND THEN SHE GETS ON TO THE IMPORTANT WORK OF CUTTING CRUSTS OFF CUCUMBER SANDWICHES? WHAT IS THE FUTURE FOR A 19th CENTURY WOMAN.
WELL, THERE'S LOVE IN THE STORY BUT HE ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS IS A BOOK THAT CELEBRATES A WOMAN'S LOCATIONMENT BECAUSE I FELT THAT IS A STORY WE'VE NEVER HEARD. AND AS A WOMAN WHO HERSELF HAS HAD HER LIFE SAVED SO MANY TIMES BY HER PASSION FOR HER WORK I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY WHOs WHO LIVES UP AND DOWNS AND ROMANCES AND DRAMAS MAY COME AND GO BUT WHAT IS AT THE CENTRE OF IS IT IS THIS DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND NOTHING LESS THAN THE WORKING OF THE NATURAL WORLD. SHE SPENDS HER COMPLETE LIFE IN DEVOTION TO SCIENCE.
IS SHE OBSESSED.
SHE'S OBSESSED.
YOU DID A TALK ON CREATIVITY.
I DIDN'T AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAID IS THAT YOU DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO LIKE SUFFER TO BE AN ARTIST, OKAY.
YEAH.
YOU HAVE SUFFERED?
SURE. I HAVE SUFFERED.
OKAY, YOU'VE SUFFERED. AND YOU'RE AN ARTIST.
I HAVE SUFFERED BUT I HAVEN'T DEVELOPED A NARCISSISTIC ADDICTION TO THE IDEA OF BEING A SUFFERING ARTIST WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I OBJECT TO. BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE IS THIS HANGOVER FROM GERMAN ROMANT CIVIL THAT SAYS IF ARE YOU NOT MISSERABLE IN MAKING EVERYONE AROUND YOU MISERABLE THAN YOU ARE NOT A SERIOUS ARTIST. AND I DISAGREE WITH THAT.
VAN GOGH DIDN'T CUT OFF HIS EARS ALIKE A WEIGHT LOSS. HE'S A MESSERABLE PERSON. DON'T GREAT ARTIST, I'M NOT SAYING YOU AREN'T A GREAT ARTIST. PAIN ARE YOU AND ARE YOU NOT GIVING YOUR SUFFERING ENOUGH CREDIT.
RIGHT. I SHOULD SORT OF GO DEEPER INTO IT.
MAYBE YOUR NARCISSISM IS SAYING THAT I'M NOT A NARS CYST-- NARSISYS.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WHO WROTE TWO MEMOIRS IN A ROW SHOULD HAVE TO DEFENDED QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT SHE'S A NARSISYS. THAT PUTS ME IN A BAD POSITION.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT THIS IDEA. WHAT IF EVERYBODY SUFFERED BUT ARTISTS DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
THAT'S TRUE.
THEY LEAVE THEIR SUFFERING OUT IN, LIKE PAINT ON A PALACE.
YEAH.
AND THEN THEY SHOW YOU WHAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE-- EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT SHOWING YOU THEIR SUFFERING, THEY DON'T HAVE-- YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAINT THE TIERS BUT YOU CAN USE THE TEARS TO PAINT SOMETHING PRETTY.
DO YOU PAINT A LOT WITH YOUR TEARS.
I HAVE NEVER SUFFERED.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
ALWAYS A JOY, STEPHEN, THANK YOU.
Stephen: ELIZABETH GILBERT, THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS.
