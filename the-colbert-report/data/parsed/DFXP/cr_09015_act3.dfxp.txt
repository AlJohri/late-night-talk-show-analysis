THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN EXPERT ON  ANCIENT ROMAN CULTURE. I'LL ASK WHICH IS BETTER:  DOMINO'S OR PAPA JOHN'S. PLEASE WELCOME ANTHONY EVERITT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOININGING  ME. CIRCUMSTANCE YOU'VE WRITTEN  EXTENSIVELY ON ANCIENT ROME. YOU WROTE THE BOOK CICERO,  AUGUSTOUS, AND YOUR NEW BOOK IS  CALLED "THE RISE OF ROME, THE  MAKING OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST EMPIRE."  WHY IS THE ROME THE WORLD'S  GREATEST EMPIRE? AREN'T WE THE GREATEST EMPIRE  RIGHT NOW?
YOU ARE ON THE WAY. YOU ARE THE NEW ONE.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU. THAT'S A COMPLIMENT. IS THAT A COMPLIMENT?
WELL, IT MIGHT BE A  COMPLIMENT. THE ROMANS WERE TIRESOME PEOPLE?
STEPHEN: TIRESOME?
THEY WERE BRUTAL. THEY WEREN'T VERY CULTURED. THEY KNEW THEY DIDN'T HAVE A  CULTURE SO THEY WENT TO GREECE.
STEPHEN: WE TOOK YOUR  CULTURE WHEN WE STOLE HARRY  POTTER FROM YOU GUYS.
YES. [ LAUGHTER ]
STEPHEN: YOU GUYS ARE  GREECE TO OUR ROME.
I HAVEN'TING FOR GIVEN YOU  FOR THAT.
STEPHEN: EMPIRES DON'T  CARE. YOU USED TO HAVE AN EMPIRE.
WE HAD IT FOR 10 MINUTES. YOU'VE HIT FOR FIVE MINUTES. THE ROAMENTANS HAD IT FOR 1,000  YEARS.
STEPHEN: WHAT DID THEY DO  RIGHT?
WHEN THEY WENT AND BEAT  SOMEBODY UP AND DEFEATED THEM  THEY SAID, RIGHT. THAT'S OVER. WE'VE WON. COME AND JOIN US. JOIN IN THE ENTERPRISE. YOU CAN BECOME CITIZENS. YOU CAN HAVE A SHARE OF BOOTY  BUT WE GO ON FOR THE NEXT WAR. EVERY TIME THEY HAD A VICTORY,  THEY PRODUCED MORE AND MORE  PEOPLE, GOT THEM ON TO THEIR  SIDE AND SO THE ROMAN EMPIRE WAS ACTUALLY FULL OF STAKEHOLDERS,  PEOPLE FOR WHOM IT WAS  BENEFICIAL TO HAVE THE EMPIRE.
STEPHEN: YOU MAKE THAT  SOUND KIND OF WARM AND FUZZY BUT  THSH --
THE JEWS GOT VERY CROSS.
STEPHEN: THE JEWS OFTEN GET  CROSS. BUT THEY ARE A TOUGH PEOPLE.
I KNOW.
STEPHEN: WHAT DID THE JEWS  DO?
THEY REVOLTED BECAUSE THEY  REFUSED TO WORSHIP THE EMPEROR.
STEPHEN: DIDN'T HAVE THE  ROMANS HAVE A WAY -- THEY WITH  GO INTO SOME PLACE, -- IF  SOMEBODY IN A VILLAGE KILLED LIKE A ROMAN SOLDIER, WOULDN'T  THEY GO IN AND CRUCIFY EVERYBODY  IN THE VILLAGE.
THEY WOULD, INDEED.
STEPHEN: AND THEY INVITE  THE NEXT VILLAGE OVER AND GO YOU  WANT THIS OR DO YOU WANT A ROAD?
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID.
STEPHEN: I LOVE THAT MOVIE. IT'S A DOCUMENTARY? [ LAUGHTER ]
IF YOU REFUSED TO JOIN IN, IF  YOU REFUSED TO BECOME PROPER  ROMAN CITIZENS AND JOIN IN THE  NEXT INVASION OF THE NEXT GROUP OF PEOPLE IF YOU DIDN'T DO THAT,  THERE WAS REAL TROUBLE STEENCHT  WHO WAS YOUR FAVORITE CRAZY  ROMAN EMPEROR. I'LL START ALAGABALIS.
HE WAS IN THE PUBLIC LAUGH  TORY.
STEPHEN: HE MAYOR YUD A  VIRGIN, WORSHIPED A METEORITE  AND HE WOULD SMOTHER DINNER  GUESTS IN --
MY FAVORITE IS THE FIRST ONE. HE SET THE SCENE. JULIUS CAESAR. HE WASN'T ONLY A POLITICIAN AND  GENIUS HE WAS A VERY GOOD  WRITER. YES.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DOG-O DOGGERY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOT AT ALL. CAESAR IS MY FAVORITE BECAUSE HE  WASN'T JUST A MARBLE STATUE IN A  MUSICAL. HE'S VERY MUCH FLESH AND BLOOD.
STEPHEN: HE GOT IT ON WITH  CLEOPATRA.
HE ENJOYED SEX. HE LIKED SHARING WIFES WITH HIS  FRIENDS.
STEPHEN: HE WOULD HAVE SEX  WITH THE WIVES OF HIS OPPONENTS?
HE DID, YEAH. THAT'S HOW HE LEARNED THEIR  PLANS.
STEPHEN: HE WAS A CASANOVA.
AND WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG GUY  HE WAS SCREWED RATHER THAN DOING  THE SCROOGE BY THE KING.
Stephen: THE KING HAD SEX  WITH HIM.
HE WAS SCREWED INTO THE  GROUND OF MARBLE FLOOR OF  PALACE?
STEPHEN: ARE YOU SAYING? HE WAS BUGGER AS A YOUNG MAN BY  THE KING OF SARDINIA?
I DIDN'TCY THAT I SAID  BISSINIA.
STEPHEN: I THOUGHT YOU HAD  A LISP. THEY WERE A SUPERPOWER.
THEY WEREN'T TO BEGIN WITH. AS CATO THE ELDER SAID -- JUST  CHECKING.
STEPHEN: OF COURSE, OKAY. HOW LONG DID ROME LAST?
DEPENDS ON HOW YOU START AND  FINISH. ROME WAS FOUNDED IN 753 B.C. OR  THEREABOUTS FUSM INCLUDE THE  EASTERN HALF HALF OF EMPIRE,  THEY CALLED THEMSELVES ROMANS THAT WAS 1400 AND SOMETHING WHEN  THE MUSLIMS --
STEPHEN: YOU ARE AN  HISTORIAN --
I LIKE BEING VAGUE ABOUT  DATES.
STEPHEN: I UNDERSTAND. I WISH YOU HAD BEEN MY TEACHER  IN HIGH SCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH  ANTHONY EVERITT, "THE RISE OF  ROME."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
