[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: SO, WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS CO CREATOR OF NPRs "PLANET MONEY" IT WAS EARTH THE WHOLE TIME. PLEASE WELCOME ALEX BLUMBERG. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: ALEX, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. Stephen: NICE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE AND SEE YOUR FACE AT THE SAME TIME.
YES. Stephen: YOU'RE CO CREATOR OF NPRs "PLANET MONEY" CO CREATOR OF "TEE SHIRT PROJECT."
YES. Stephen: NOT A FAN OF THIS PROJECT. THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE IS SOMEPLACE WE EXPORT WORK TO HAVE HAPPEN IN WHATEVER CONDITIONS WE WANT. THE PRODUCTS COME BACK TO ME CHEAP ENOUGH TO THROW AWAY WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT. THAT'S THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET. WHY DO YOU WANT TO MAKE THE HAND OF THE MARKET VISIBLE.
WE'RE ALL PARTICIPATING IN IT IF WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT OR NOT. OUR T SHIRTS. WE MADE A TEE SHIRT.
Stephen: YOU MADE A TEE SHIRT FOR "PLANET MONEY." IT HAS A SQUIRREL WITH A MARTINI. WHY IS THE SQUIRREL DRINKING BOOZE ON THE "PLANET MONEY" TEE SHIRT.
IT'S HARDER THAN WE THOUGHT TO COME UP WITH A DESIGN FOR A TEE SHIRT. [LAUGHING]
YA. Stephen: OKAY. OKAY.
WE WANTED TO DEAL WITH -- THE REASON WE WANTED TO MAKE THE TEE SHIRT IS TO SEE THERE IS A WORLD BEHIND THE CLOTHES WE WEAR. THIS TEE SHIRT WENT FROM COTTON MILLS IN MISSISSIPPI.
Stephen: THERE IS STILL ENOUGH COTTON GROWN IN THE DEEP SOUTH OF THE UNITED STATES.
IT TURNS OUT COTTON IS -- UNITED STATES LEADS THE WORLD IN EXPORTING COTTON. NUMBER ONE COTTON EXPORTER IN THE WORLD.
Stephen: WHO IS PICKING THAT COTTON?
NO ONE. IT'S ALL MACHINES. ALMOST NOBODY ACTUALLY WORKING ON THE FARM. LIKE 13 PEOPLE ON THE COTTON FARM IT PRODUCED ENOUGH COTTON TO MAKE NINE MILLION T SHIRTS. THIS ONE FARM IN MISSISSIPPI.
Stephen: WOW.
YES. Stephen: OKAY. SO, YOU HAVE ALL OF THIS COTTON. WHERE DOES IT GO?
SO, IT GOES. THEN IT GOES ON A GLOBAL JOURNEY. IT TRAVELS 20,000 MILES AS IT IS MADE INTO A TEE SHIRT. SPINNING FACTORIES IN INDONESIA. THEN GARMENT FACTORIES AND BACK TO YOU.
Stephen: SWEATSHOPS? THIS IS NPR TEE SHIRT. IS THIS MADE WITH SWEATSHOP HRAEUBER?
Don: Stephen: REALLY. IT'S MADE IN BANGLADESH. THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS SWEAT.
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANTED TO LOOK AT. SO IN BANGLADESH THERE IS SOMETHING TO WHAT YOU SAY. BASICALLY --
Stephen: GENERALLY.
-- BECAUSE BANGLADESH IS A INCREDIBLY POOR COUNTRY. WE INTERVIEWED A PERSON, THE CEO OF A GARMENT MANUFACTURING COMPANY. HE SAYS OUR GOVERNMENT TPO +LG FOLLOWS POVERTY. IT GOES TO THE POOREST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD OF HRAEUB TORE MAKE THE SHIRTS.
Stephen: IT'S NOT A SWEATSHOP. WHAT IS YOUR STANDARD FOR SWEATSHOPS.
WHEN YOU HAVE A COUNTRY LIKE BANGLADESH WHERE YOU HAVE MILLIONS IN ABJECT POVERTY. YOU HAVE A BIG CORPORATION, THEY CAN BE EXPLOITED. ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY AND THE GARMENT INDUSTRY IS SMALL BUT A SIGNIFICANT STEP ABOVE --
Stephen: BY EXPORTING OUR GARMENT WORK TO BANGLADESH ARE WE HELPING THESE PEOPLE OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PEOPLE?
IT'S A REALLY FINE LINE. SOMETIMES WE'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEM. SOMETIMES WE'RE HELPING THEM. THE PEOPLE IN BANGLADESH, MOST PEOPLE, THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WORKING IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY OF BANGLADESH. THEY'RE CONSIDERED GOOD JOBS. IF YOU'RE NOT WORKING IN A GARMENT FACTORY YOU PROBABLY WANT A JOB IN ONE.
Stephen: CONDITIONS OR PAY INCREASE.
YES. THE CONDITIONS -- THE MINIMUM WAGE ALMOST DOUBLED IN THE MONTH AFTER WE GOT BACK FROM $39 A MONTH TO THE $60 A MONTH.
Stephen: SO MUCH WORK IS SENT THERE THEY CAN ASK FOR HIGHER WAGES.
AND I THINK THE WORLD IS PAYING ATTENTION NOW TO BANGLADESH.
Stephen: ARE THEY NOT POOR ENOUGH FOR US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM ANYMORE? CAN WE MOVE TO THE FOURTH WORLD AT THIS POINT. DO WE MOVE TO ANTARCTICA AND TEACH THE PENGUINS TO SEW?
THIS IS INTERESTING. OUR GARMENTS HAVE GOTTEN CHEAPER AND CHEAPER. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PLACE TO GO TO PAY WORKERS LESS.
Stephen: THERE IS NOTHING LESS THAN A TEE SHIRT. WE FIRE THEM OUT OF AN ONS AT DRUNK PEOPLE.
WE INTERVIEWED A GUY WHO BOUGHT T SHIRTS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO LAUNDRY.
Stephen: HE'S BURNING HIS CLOTHES.
YES, THAT'S HOW CHEAP OUR CLOTHES ARE. I THINK THE TREND IS AT AN END NOW. IT SEEMS THAT BANGLADESH IS THE CHEAPEST PLACE.
Stephen: THERE ISN'T A CHEAPER PLACE? I THOUGHT THEY HAD FACTORY SHIPS THAT PULLED UP TO A PORT IN A CITY AND SAID COME ON YOU DESPERATE PEOPLE MAKE OUR CLOTHES. IF YOU ASK FOR HIGHER WAGES WE WILL TAKE THE SHIP SOMEWHERE ELSEWHERE THEY WON'T ASK.
I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST PEOPLE FROM DOING THAT.
Stephen: DID I JUST COME UP WITH THE GREATEST IDEA EVER. IF SO I WANT A PIECE IT HAD. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU. Stephen: ALEX BLUMBERG. HOW MUCH FOR THE SHIRT.
$30. Stephen: $30 FOR THE SHIRT.
