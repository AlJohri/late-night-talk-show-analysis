TONIGHT I TACKLE THE  EXCITING ISSUE OF COPYRIGHT  INFRINGEMENT SO BE SURE TO BOOTLEG TONIGHT'S SHOW FOR  YOUR FRIENDS. THEN CONTROVERSY OVER THE  BIRTH OF JESUS. TURNS OUT THERE WAS ROOM AT  THE INN BUT JOSEPH DIDN'T  HAVE ENOUGH REWARD POINTS. AND MY GUEST JOURNALIST JAKE  TAPPER HAS WRITTEN A BOOK  ABOUT AMERICAN SOLDIERS  FIGHTING IN AFGHANISTAN. SOME DAY I HOPE TO BE BRAVE  ENOUGH TO READ IT. I'M BACK AND I'M BETTER THAN  SOMETIME. THIS IS "THE COLBERT  REPORT."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO  MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, I HOPE YOU HAD A  GREAT THANKSGIVING. I DID. FIRST OF ALL A CAUGHT UP ON  HOMELAND. YOU GUYS SEE THAT SHOW ON  THE SHOWTIME CHANNEL. I LOVE THAT CHAENL. NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT,  IT'S THE TWISTING TALE OF AN  IRAQ WAR VET WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE A TERRORIST OP  RATTIVE, OR A DOUBLE AGENT  WHOSE'S BEEN BRAINWASHED BY  AL QAEDA WHO MATCHES WITS WITH A BY POLAR CIA OP  RATTIVE WHO IS CONVINCED  THAT HE'S PART OF AN ATTACK  AGAINST AMERICA AND IS AN ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN AFFAIR  WITH HIM.
HERE WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE  OUT. WHEN DO THEY CHARGE THEIR  CELL PHONES? THEY'RE ALWAYS ON THEM. ALWAYS! AND THEY'RE ALWAYS FULL,  NEVER PLUGGED INTO ANYTHING. NOT EVEN IN THE CAR. IT'S ALWAYS LIKE FULL BARS. DC, BEIRUT, BAGHDAD, GREAT  RECEPTION. MAKES THE WHOLE THING KIND  OF UNBELIEVABLE. (LAUGHTER)  ANYWAY, HI A GREAT  THANKSGIVING. I CELEBRATED THE TRADITIONAL  MANNER WITH MY FAMILY OR AS  THE INDIANS CALL THEM MAZE. BUT FOLKS WE ALL KNOW  THANKSGIVING IS JUST A  PREAMBLE TO THE HOLIEST DAY  THE YEAR, BLACK FRIDAY. WHEN AMERICANS-- WHEN  AMERICANS COME TOGETHER TO  BOW BEFORE THEIR LORD THE  WAL-MART ROLLBACK GUY. BECAUSE JESUS ISN'T THE ONLY  ONE WHO IS SAVED. AND BLACK FRIDAY, BECAUSE  BLACK FRIDAY LAS BIBLICAL  ROOTS. THAT'S WHEN THE THREE WISE  MEN GOT THAT KILLER BUY GOLD  AND FRANKINCENSE GET ONE MYRRH FREE, DEAL. AND FOLKS THIS YEAR WAS A  GREAT ONE FOR RETAILERS.
SALES BROKE RECORDS BOTH  ON-LINE AND IN STORES. A TOTAL OF $247 MILLION  PEOPLE SHOPPED. THAT'S A 9% INCREASE OVER  LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS. EACH SHOPPER SPENT ON  AVERAGE $425-- $423, TOTAL  SPENDING OVER THE FOUR DAY  WEEKEND HIT A RECORD $59.1  BILLION.
Stephen: $59.1 BILLION. FOLKS, I'M SURE THAT'S GOOD  FOR THE ECONOMY. BUT FRANKLY I'M WORRIED THAT  BLACK FRIDAY IS BEING RUINED  BY COMMERCIALISM. (LAUGHTER)  NOWADAYS IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW  MUCH YOU'RE GOING BUY. WHAT DEAL YOU'RE GOING TO  GET. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO  TRAMPLING PEOPLE FOR THE  LOVE OF THE GAME? OR JUST--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  OR JUST EXPERIENCING THE  PURE CHILD-LIKE JOY OF THROAT PUNCHING AN OLD LADY  OVER THAT LAST $20 DIRT  DEVIL. WELL, YOU KNOW I GUESS I'M  OLD-FASHIONED. NOW FOLKS, JUSTICE MAY BE  BLIND BUT I'M NOT. I'M PRETTY SURE SHE'S  WEARING SPANX UNDER THAT  ROBE. THIS IS JUDGE, JURY AND  EXECUTIONER. TONIGHT, FOLKS, COPYRIGHT  LAW. THE SUPREME COURT IS  CURRENTLY CONSIDERING THE  CASE OF SUPAP KIRTSAENG THE  WILE YA SONG, IT A TEXTBOOK COPYRIGHT CASE IN THAT IT IS  A COPYRIGHT CASE ABOUT  TEXTBOOKS. JIM.
MR. KIRTSAENG IN 1997  MOVED FROM HIS NATIVE  THAILAND TO ATTEND CORNELL  UNIVERSITY. TEXTBOOKS ARE SOLD IN  THAILAND FOR JUST A FRACTION  OF THE COST. SO HE GETS HIS FAMILY AND  FRIENDS TO BUY THOSE  TEXTBOOKS IN THAILAND AND  GUESS WHAT, SHIP THEM TO HIM IN CORNELL UNIVERSITY. HE SELLS THEM ON eBAY AND  MAKES, GET THIS, $1.2  MILLION IN PROFITS.
WHAT?
Stephen: 1.2 MILLION  DOLLARS, IT THAT TEXTBOOK  PRICE, THAT HAS TO BE LIKE EIGHT BOOKS. BUT ACADEMIC PUBLISHER WILEY  AND SON SUED SIT   KAENING-- KIRTSAENG SAYING  THEY OWN THE COPYRIGHT OF THAT RESOLD MATERIAL DESPITE  A 1908 COURT DECISION WHICH  ESTABLISHED THE FIRST SALE DOCTRINE WHICH SAYS THAT  AFTER A BUYER FIRST  PURCHASES A COPYRIGHTED WORK  HE OR SHE HAS THE RIGHT TO RESELL IT. I'M SORRY, I DON'T BUY THIS  FIRST SALE ARGUMENT. AND IF I DID BUY IT I WOULD  NOT RESELL IT. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE  RIGHT. YEAH. DAMN STRAIGHT. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT  NEVER'S CLAPPING FOR. (LAUGHTER)  BUT GOD HELP US, IF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT DOES OVERTURN  THE RIGHT OF FIRST SALE.
YOU ARE HEARING A CASE  THAT IF THEY RULE ONE WAY  WOULD SAY TO US, WE THE PEOPLE, HEY, YOU CAN'T SELL  YOUR OWN STUFF.
IT WOULD ALMOST MAKE eBAY  ILLEGAL.
Stephen: eBAY ILLEGAL? THAT COULD DESTABILIZE THE  GLOBAL MARKET IN WELCOME  BACK KOTTER BOARD GAMES. BUT DON'T WORRY. EVEN IF THE SUPREME COURT  SIDES WITH WILEY AND SONS T  WOULDN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T SELL  ANYTHING. THE COURT HAS RULED THAT THE  RIGHT OF FIRST SALE APPLIES  TO ANY PRODUCT MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES. SO YOU ARE FREE TO RESELL  ANYTHING STILL MADE IN  AMERICA LIKE YOUR TRUCK OR  YOUR METH. AND YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO  RESELL ANYTHING MADE  OVERSEAS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE  THE PERMISSION OF THE ORIGINAL COPYRIGHT HOLDER. FOR INSTANCE, I AM HAVING A  GARAGE SALE THIS WEEKEND. SOME OF THE STUFF WAS MADE  OVERSEAS, SO I AM SIMPLY  CALLING ALL THE COPYRIGHT  HOLDERS TO WORK OUT A PROFIT SHARING ARRANGEMENT. HERE WE GO. OKAY.
