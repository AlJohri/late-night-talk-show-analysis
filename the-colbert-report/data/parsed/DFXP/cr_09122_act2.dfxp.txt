[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, THOUGH I WAS ON  VACATION ONE OF THE FEW STORIES  I PAID ATTENTION TO OVER MY BREAK WAS THE TRAGIC CRASH  LANDING OF ASIANA FLIGHT 214 AT  SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL  AIRPORT. THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND  EVERYONE AFFECTED BY THIS HAS MY  DEEPEST SYMPATHIES. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHO HAS NONE  OF MY SYMPATHY, THE FOLKS OVER  AT SAN FRANCISCO'S NEWS LEADER.
WE HAVE JUST LEARNED THE  NAMES OF THE FOUR PILOTS WHO  WERE ON BOARD THE FLIGHT. THEY ARE CAPTAIN SUM TING WONG,  WI TU LOW, HO LEE FUK, AND BANG  DING OW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELL OBVIOUSLY  THAT'S A MAJOR FOOK-UP. AND ANCHOR TORY CAMPBELL QUICKLY  APOLOGIZED.
EARLIER IN THE NEWSCAST WE  GAVE SOME NAMES OF PILOTS  INVOLVED IN THE ASIANA AIRLINES  CRASH. THESE NAMES WERE NOT ACCURATE  DESPITE AN N.T.S.B. OFFICIAL IN  WASHINGTON CONFIRMING THEM LATE THIS MORNING.
Stephen: THE N.T.S.B. RESPONDED BY SAYING THAT THE  OFFICIAL WHO CONFIRMED IT WAS A  SUMMER INTERN. DAMMIT. TIMMY HAD TWO JOBS: GET COFFEE  AND CONFIRM THE NAMES OF PILOTS  IN AIRLINE DISASTERS. FOLKS, I DON'T CARE WHO  CONFIRMED THESE NAMES. IT IS WRONG I MEAN "WE TOO LOW"? BANG DING OW? THIS IS A KOREAN AIRLINE. THOSE ARE CHINESE NAMES. THAT'S RACIST. OKAY. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO A  RACIST JOKE, AT LEAST GET THE  ETHNICITY RIGHT. LIKE CAPTAIN PARK MA PLEN TU SUN  OR HA YU LAN DIS TANG WELL,  UNDERSTANDABLY, UNDERSTANDABLY, FOLKS, UNDERSTANDABLY, ASIANA  AIRLINES IS PISSED AND ANNOUNCED  TODAY THAT IT WILL SUE K.T.V.U. FOR BROADCASTING THE NAMES  SAYING THEY DAMAGED THE  AIRLINE'S REPUTATION. YES, THESE JOKE NAMES DAMAGED  ASIANA'S STERLING REPUTATION AS  A WORLD LEADER IN ALMOST LANDING  PLANES. AND I WILL TELL YOU ANOTHER  THING. I WILL TELL YOU ANOTHER THING. K.T.V.U. MAY BE BLAMING THIS ON  THE N.T.S.B. FOR CONFIRMING THE  NAMES BUT THEY STILL HAVEN'T EXPLAINED WHO PUT THOSE FAKE  NAMES INTO THE SCRIPT IN THE  FIRST PLACE. I'LL TELL YOU WHO I BLAME. K.T.V.U. NEWS DIRECTOR MUNCHMA  QUCHI. WE'LL BE RIGHT
