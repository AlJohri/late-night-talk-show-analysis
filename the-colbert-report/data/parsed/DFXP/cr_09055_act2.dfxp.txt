STEEJ WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME BACK TO THE BROADCAST. FOLKS, BY NOW IT SHOULD BE  CLEAR, WE ARE IN THE WANING DAYS  OF OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS, AND I HOPE YOU'RE MAKING THE  MOST OF IT. THIS WEEKEND, I TOOK MY GUN  SWEETNESS UP TO A B & B IN THE  CATSKILLS FOR A LITTLE ALONE TIME, AND LET'S JUST SAY THEY  HAD TO REPLACE THE SHEETS-- [LAUGHTER] AND THE WINDOWS-- [LAUGHTER] AND THE LAMPS-- [LAUGHTER] AND THE COFFEE MAKER-- [LAUGHTER] AND SOME OF THE ROOFING. WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO NOT  RETURN. [LAUGHTER] BUT TODAY PRESIDENT KUMBAYA  O'HEMP-SHIRT BROUGHT THE  ANTI-GUN SHOW TO MINNEAPOLIS.
IF THERE'S EVEN ONE THING WE  CAN DO TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN  SAFE, WE'VE GOT AN OBLIGATION TO TAKE THAT STEP. WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, THAT'S  OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS AMERICANS.
Stephen: WRONG. OUR RESPONSIBLITY AS AMERICANS  IS TO OBEY THE CONSTITUTION AND  DEEP-FRY ANYTHING WITH FOUR LEGS-- INCLUDING TABLES AND  CHAIRS! [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, OBAMA CLAIMS HE'S NOT  TRYING TO TAKE AWAY OUR GUNS,  AND EVEN TOLD THE NEW REPUBLIC, "UP AT CAMP DAVID, WE DO SKEET  SHOOTING ALL THE TIME."  I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE THIS BULL SKEET. JIM?
FEW PEOPLE ARE BUYING  PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CLAIM THAT HE  IS A BIG FAN OF SKEET SHOOTING.
IF HE IS A SKEET SHOOTER, WHY  HAVE WE NOT HEARD OF THIS? WHY HAS HE NOT REFERENCED IT AT  ANY POINT IN TIME?
I LOVE THE FACT THAT HE  PICKED THE SAFEST THING. THERE'S NO LIVE ANIMALS BEING  HURT. OF COURSE, THE KIDS AREN'T  AROUND. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: IF OBAMA REALLY  LOVED GUNS, WHY WOULD HE BE  USING THEM SAFELY? HE'D BE WAVING 'EM AROUND AT A  PETTING ZOO, PICKING OFF BABY  GOATS. [LAUGHTER] BUT THE WHITE HOUSE WASN'T DONE  SPINNING THIS STORY. TO COUNTER THE SKEPTICS, THEY  RELEASED THIS PHOTO OF HIM  SHOOTING A GUN. FOLKS, IT DOESN'T PROVE HE WAS  SHOOTING SKEET. AS ONE CRITIC POINTED OUT  "THE PRESIDENT IS HOLDING THE  SHOTGUN AS ONE WOULD HOLD AND AIM A RIFLE. IF THE PRESIDENT WERE ACTUALLY  SHOOTING ON A SKEET OR TRAP  RANGE, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WEARING A BELT WITH A SHELL BAG  OR A SHOOTING VEST."  YES, SO HE'S CLEARLY NOT ON A SHOOTING RANGE. BUT IF HE'S NOT, WHERE IS HE? JIMMY, PUT THAT PHOTO UP FULL  SCREEN. NOW, PULL OUT. HE'S ON THE SOUNDSTAGE WHERE  THEY FAKED THE MOON LANDING! [LAUGHTER] OH, THIS IS DEEPER THAN WE  THOUGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
