THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS. THERE IS TONS OF EXCITEMENT  IN THE AIR TONIGHT. IT IS THE FINAL NIGHT OF  HOBBIT WEEK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I'M SO EXCITED, FOLKS. I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT  TONIGHT'S SHOW, I HAVE BEEN  CAMPING OUTSIDE MY STUDIO  SINCE 5 A.M. DRESSED AS MY FAVORITE  CHARACTER. TONIGHT'S GUEST DIRECTOR  PETER JACKSON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHO HAS REQUESTED THAT  TONIGHT'S INTERVIEW BE  BROKEN INTO THREE PARTS AND AIRED EVERY DECEMBER UNTIL  2014. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IT'S JUST  BEEN A GREAT WEEK. AND SPENDING TIME WITH THE  CREATORS OF THE HOBBIT FOR  THE PAST FOUR DAYS HAS  CHANGED ME IN WAYS I NEVER  EXPECTED. I MEAN IT'S HARD TO PUT MY  FINGER ON IT. (LAUGHTER)  I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT IS  SUCH HIGH MAINTENANCE. I CAN NEVER FIND THE PARTS. AND FRANKLY MY MANI-PEDI  GIRL IS ON A SUICIDE WATCH. BUT OF COURSE TONIGHT A BIG  STORY COMES FROM MY HOME  STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
BIG BREAKING NEWS IN THIS  TOWN, SENATOR JIM DEMINT, A  TEA PARTY FAVORITE AND CONSERVATIVE ICON IS  SURPRISINGLY RESIGNING HIS  SEAT HE HAD TEND OF  THE-- END OF THE YEAR.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,  SOUTH CAROLINA JIM DEMINT IS  DE-QUITTING. NOW THE DECISION ON WHO WILL  REPLACE DEMINT FALLS TO  SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR AND FRIEND OF THE SHOW NIKKI  HALEY. BUT WHO WILL SHE PICK. LET'S SEE, YOU WANT SOMEBODY  YOUNG. SOMEBODY CONSERVE FIV,  SOMEBODY FROM SOUTH  CAROLINA. MAYBE SOMEBODY WHO HAD A  SUPER PAC. WAIT A SECOND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WATCH WHERE YOU POINT THAT  THING, IT'S POWERFUL. OKAY. NOW FOLKS I'M TO THE GOING  TO SIT HERE AND SAY I SHOULD  BE SOUTH CAROLINA'S NEXT  SENATOR. NOT WHEN SO MANY OTHER  PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT FOR ME. "U.S.A. TODAY" IS STEPHEN  COLBERT RUNNING FOR THE U.S. SENATE. HUFFINGTON POST, STEPHEN  COLBERT FOR SENATE. ROLE CALL, SOUTH CAROLINA  FOR STEPHEN COLBERT. "NEW YORK POST", ARE WE  READY FOR SENATOR COLBERT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ARE WE READY? WELL, I GET IT I GET IT I  KNOW WHEN I LOOK AT THE U.S. SENATE. I SAY TO MYSELF, YOU KNOW  WHAT THEY COULD USE, ANOTHER  WHITE GUY. (LAUGHTER)  SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE TO THE  TWITTERS, OKAY, TAKE TO THE  TWITTERS. I WANT YOU TO TWEET@NIKKI-- ASK  NIKKI HALEY WHY SHE SHOULD  APPOINT ME TO THE U.S. IS SENATE WITH THE HASHTAG  SENATOR COLBERT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  S THAT-- THAT FEELS RIGHT. NOW OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW  JIM DEMINT LEAVES SOME BIG  SHOES TO FILL. THEN AGAIN--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT  THE PEOPLE WANT ME TO HAVE THIS HONOR. I'VE BEEN HONORED IN SO MANY  WAYS. IN LEGO FORM, IN ICE CREAM,  IN SPACE STATION TREADMILL,  AS A PLUSH HOCKEY MASCOT. WHICH OF COURSE LET ME  REALIZE MY DREAM OF HAVING  DRUNK TOWNIES THROW BEER  CANS AT ME. BUT NOW THE ULTIMATE HONOR  HAS COME. BEING IMMORTALLIZED AT  MADAME TUSSAUD'S WAX MUSEUM. THEY-- I KNOW, I KNOW, IT'S  IMPRESSIVE. THEY HAVE THE WORLD'S  BIGGEST COLLECTION OF GLASSY  EYED FAKE CELEBRITIES  OUTSIDE OF THE BRAVO  NETWORK. NOW -- WHILE MADAME TUSSAUD  IS A STORIED INSTITUTION  WITH 200 YEARS OF EXCELLENCE, COULD EVEN THEY CAPTURE MY  ESSENCE? FIND OUT TONIGHT IN.
STEPHEN COLBERT, WAX ON  AND WAX OFF AT MADAME  TUSSAUD THE. LAST JUNE I SAT DOWN WITH  THE ART FRIST MADAME  TUSSAUDS SO I COULD GET  WAXED.
JUST LEAVE A LANDING  STRIP, OKAY, DO THAT FOR ME? THEY WALKED ME THROUGH THEIR  PAINSTAKING PROCESS.
WHEN THEY MAKE YOUR  FIGURE THEY WILL INSERT  EVERY HAIR IN YOUR FIGURE'S INDIVIDUALLY, EVERY EYE LASH,  EVERY EYEBROW, IT TAKES SIX  WEEKS.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
ISN'T IT.
I'M SO GLAD THAT EFFORT  ISN'T GOING INTO CURING  CANCER.
IF YOU HAVE A TATTOO  SOMEWHERE WE WANT TO  RE-CREATE THAT.
I DO. I HAVE A BLACK PANTHER  CRAWLING OUT OF MY BUTT  CRACK.
THAT'S AWESOME.
IT SAYS WELCOME TO THE  LAIR AND THE PANTHER IS  GOING-- SO YOU HAVE A BOX OF EYEBALL ITS.
WE DO.
DO THESE COME FROM  CHINESE PRISONERS.
THEY ARE GLASS, WHAT ARE  YOU TALKING ABOUT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHINESE  PEOPLE ARE MADE OF. I HAVE NO IDEA. (LAUGHTER)  NEXT I SLIPPED INTO  SOMETHING MORE REVEALING SO  THEY COULD MEASURE MY EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I FEEL DIRTY.
SO DAN, HOW DID YOU GET  THIS JOB.
I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER  AT THE MADAME IN WASHINGTON  D.C..
AS A CHILD DID YOU DREAM  OF TURNING PEOPLE SLOWLY IN  A CIRCLE.
OH, IT BURNS!
I DID IT. MY WORK WAS DONE. I SAT, THEN THE ARTISTS GOT  TO WORK. WHILE THEY ATTEMPTED TO  REPRODUCE MY WAXY PALLOR I  HEADED TO THE MUSEUM IN  WASHINGTON D.C. TO CHECK OUT MY FUTURE WAX COMPANIONS. MY GUIDE WAS AN INCREDIBLY  LIFE LIKE DAN RAGOSKY. (LAUGHTER)  WE SHOULD GET GOING.

I AM NOT LOOKING.
COULD DO YOU HAVE THE  AUTHORITY TO DO SO.
WITHOUT DOES, CAN I TALK  TO MADAME TUSSAUD PLEASE.
SHE DIED IN 1850.
I'M SO SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW. APOLOGIZE THAT WAS  INSENSITIVE OF ME. VERY GOOD. THAT'S EXCELLENT. WOW. YOU REALLY CAPTURED ME HERE. MY HAIR IS NOT THAT SALT AND  PEPPERY AND I'M NOT THIS FAT  BUT THAT IS MY JAW.
THIS IS GEORGE CLOONEY.
I GET THAT A LOT. BUT IT'S VERY GOOD.
THIS IS JENNIFER LOPEZ. THIS DOESN'T SEEM  APPROPRIATE. THIS IS NOT IN ANY WAY THIS  DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT TO ME  THAT I'M DOING THIS. HOW MUCH WAX DID YOU NEED TO  CREATE MY BADONKADONK.
IT IS FIBREGLASS, ARE YOU  A SEEDED FIGURE.
THEN WHY DID YOU MAKE A  CAST OF YOUR GENITALS.
WE DID NOT MAKE A CAST OF  YOUR GENITALS.
