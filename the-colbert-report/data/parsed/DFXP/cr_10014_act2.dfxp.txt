Colbert: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, LIKE ALL AMERICANS, RIGHT NOW I AM OBSESSED WITH ONE THING, THE VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE BETWEEN REPUBLICAN ANNE CUCCINELLI AND DEMOCRAT TERRY MCAULIFFE, THIS FOLKS IS THE BIGGEST BATTLE IN VIRGINIA SINCE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, WHICH OF COURSE IS STILL BEING FOUGHT IN WILLIAMSBURG. WHEN WILL THE REDCOATS SURRENDER?  AND FOLKS I HAVE TO TELL YOU I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE CUCCI BECAUSE A RECENT POLL HAS HIM TRAILING TERRY MCAULIFFE BY DOUBLE DIGITS, APPARENTLY CUCCINELLI'S MESSAGE ABOUT LAW ON ORAL SEX IS NOT GOING OVER WELL WITH THE VIRGINIA VOTERS, MANY OF WHOM EVIDENTLY HAVE GENITALS. SO, WITH JUST ONE WEEK TO GO BEFORE ELECTION DAY, CUCCINELLI HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND, RAND PAUL WHO EXPRESSED HER PRO CHOICE VIEWS AND WHAT IT WOULD AFFECT THE FUTURE.
THAT IS IRREFUTABLE, FOLKS, WHAT HE IS SAYING, THAT IS IRREFUTABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT MCAULIFFE PRO-CHOICE POLICIES WILL LEAD TO AN ETHAN HAWKE MOVIE.
DO WE WANT THAT?  WITH MSNBC THE RAVEN CHEL MAD DOW FOUND FAULT WITH RAND PAUL'S RESEARCH METHODOLOGY.
THE WEIRD THING ABOUT THAT LINE FROM SENATOR PAUL'S SPEECH TODAY IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE YOU JAN KNICKS IS COMMON IS THAT LINE APPEARS ALMOST VERBATIM IN THE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY ON "GATTACA".
ABOUT THE FUTURE, WHERE EUGENICS IS COMMON AND DNA PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE IN DETERMINING YOUR ROLE IN SOCIETY.
OH, OH JUST BECAUSE HE AND WIKIPEDIA USED THE SAME WORDS RAND PAUL IS A PLAGIARIST?  YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. MAYBE RAND PAUL WROTE THE WIKIPEDIA ENTRY ON "GATTACA". I MEAN, TO BE SAFE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY DO IN THE SENATE. AND HOW DARE, HOW DARE RACHEL MAD DOW YOU BESMIRCH THIS MAN'S GOOD NAME. RAND PAUL IS NOT A PLAGIARIST. HE IS THE JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR KENTUCKY. HE IS A MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, A GRADUATE OF THE DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, HE BEGAN PRACTICING OPHTHALMOLOGY IN BOWLING GREEN, KENTUCKY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: OPHTHALMOLOGY IS A BRANCH OF MEDICINE THAT DEALS WITH THE ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND DISEASES OF THE EYE. THE INDIAN SURGEON SUSHRUTA SAMHITA WROTE IN ABOUT 800 BC ABOUT 76 OCULAR DISEASES AS WELL AS SEVERAL OPHTHALMOLOGICAL SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS AND TECHNIQUES. SO SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF RESPECT, RACHEL MAD DOW. WHO IN THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?  AND AMERICAN TELEVISION HOST POLITICAL COMMENTARY AND AUTHOR?
WE WILL BE RIGHT
