Stephen:  HOW ARE YOU,  FOLKS? WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, DESPITE THE SENATE'S  RECENT KEFEET OF UNIVERSAL  BACKGROUND CHECKS THE GUN CONTROL DEBATE RAGES ON. WILL AMERICA ABE PLACE WHERE  ANYONE CORPORATE CAN GET A GUN  REGARDLESS OF MENTAL HEALTH OR CRIMINAL RECORD OR WILL WE FACE  THE NIGHTMARE. THERE IS SOME GOOD GUN NEWS  COMING FROM A VERY STRANGE  PLACE. YOUR U.S.B. PORT. JIM.
BOOT UP YOUR COMPUTER. DOWNLOAD A FILE, BUILD A WORKING  GUN. THIS ISN'T A FANTASY. THIS IS-- THIS IS REAL. THIS IS A VIDEO HERE THAT  ACTUALLY SHOWS THE ALL-PLASTIC  GUN BEING TESTIFIERED. IT WAS MADE FROM PARTS CREATED  BY THIS 3 D PRINTER WHICH CAN  TURN DIGITAL FILES INTO SOILED PLASTIC OBJECTS.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT,  ANYONE WITH AN INEXPENSIVE  DESKTOP 3D PRINTER CAN DOIN LOAD A FILE AND PRINT THE PARTS OF A  WORKING FIREARM IN A FEW HOURS,  MAKING IT THE FASTEST WAY TO GET A GUN IN AMERICA, NEXT TO  OPENING A CHECKING ACCOUNT IN  TEXAS. ( LAUGHTER )  NOTICE, FOLKS, THIS USES THE  SAME 3D PRINTER TECHNOLOGY I  SHOWED YOU WHEN THE HOSTED THE DEVELOPERS OF THE MAKERBOT TO  DEMONSTRATE HOW A DESKTOP  COMPUTER COULD BE USED TO PRINT ANOTHER LETHAL WEAPON-- MY HEAD. ( LAUGHTER )  DON'T WORRY. I NEVER KEEP IT LOADED. ( LAUGHTER )  PRINTING UP YOUR OWN GUN IS A  GREAT IDEA, FOLKS, ALTHOUGH PRO  TIP-- IF YOU'RE PRINTING THEM UP IF YOUR ENTIRE MOUNTAINTOM  MILITIA, BE SURE TO CHECK THE  COLLATE BOX. OTHERWISE IT WILL PRINT OUT  2,000 BARRELS THEN TWO HOW  RECOIL SPHRINGZ, 2,000 TRIGGERS. YOU'LL BE SORTING AND STAPLING  GUNS ALL NIGHT. ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  IT'S HAPPENED TO ALL OF US. AND THE MOON WITH THE GOLDEN  PLASTIC GUN IS 25-YEAR-OLD  UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS LAW STUDENT CODY WILSON, FOUNDER OF DEFENSE  DISTRIBUTED AIR, NONPROFIT  DEDICATED TO PROTECTING ACCESS TO GUNS, AND HE IS VERY CLEAR  WHY HE WANTS TO MAKE PLASTIC  FIREMANS AND HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES AVAILABLE ONLINE.
THAT'S A REAL POLITICAL ACT,  GIVING YOU A MAGAZINE. TELLING YOU THAT THAT WILL NEVER  BE TAKEN AWAY. THAT'S REAL POLITICS. THAT'S RAD CAPITOL HILL  EQUALITY. THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE IN. I'M JUST RESISTING. WHAT AM I RESISTING? I DON'T KNOW. THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE  HUMAN PSYCHE? I'M NOT SURE.
Stephen:  YEAH. THIES REAL RALLYING CRY. WHAT DO WE WANT? GUNS. WHY DO WE WANT THEM? I DON'T KNOW. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  FOLKS, THIS IS A GAME CHANGER, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE IT LOOKS  LIKE IT WAS MADE BY HASBRO. REMEMBER, KIDS, THE BRIGHT  PLASTIC GUN IS DADDY'S. THIS KIND OF GUN IS SO  ACCESSIBLE TO SO MANY PEOPLE SO  QUICKLY, DEFENSE DISTRIBUTED IS EVEN CALLING IT A WIKI-WEAPON  BECAUSE LIKE WIKIPEDIA IT WILL  ALSO BE USED TO SETTLE BAR BETS. WELL, SAD TO SAY, NO SURPRISE,  UNCLE SAM GOOSESTEPPED IN LAST  WEEK AND BOOT STOMPED OUR ONLINE FREEDOMS ORDERING DEFENSE  DISTRIBUTED TO REMOVE THE FILE  THAT PROVIDE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE 3D PRINTED GUN UNTIL IT  EXAMINES THEM FOR LEGALITY. FOLKS, THIS IS CHILLING. THE FED HAS PULLED OUR WORLDWIDE  WEAPONS AND WE ALL KNOW, ONCE  SOMETHING HAS BEEN DELETED FROM THE INTERNET, IT IS AS GONE AS  ANTHONY WEINER'S CROTCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WAS NOT  LOADED. ( LAUGHTER )  WELL, NATION, I'M NOT GOING TO  STAND FOR THIS. YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PRINT OUT  A GUN, BUT IF YOU HEAD OVER TO  colbernation.com RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW  TO TURN YOUR PRINTER INTO A GUN. IT SHOOTS 8 1/2 X 11 BULLETS  THAT GIVE INTRUDERS A NASTY  PAPERCUT AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SQUEEZE A LEMON ON  THEM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
