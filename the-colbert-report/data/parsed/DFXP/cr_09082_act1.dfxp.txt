[ LAUGHTER ] LADIES ANDLADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM, OF  COURSE, STEPHEN COLBERT. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS,  CONGRATULATIONS ON WAKING UP  FROM YOUR EIGHT-YEAR COMA. [ LAUGHTER ] LET ME GET YOU UP TO SPEED FOR  SOME OF THE THINGS YOU MIGHT  HAVE MISSED. FIRST OF ALL THE ECONOMY IS  TERRIBLE. LA OF LAUGH ALL HUMAN THOUGHT  HAS NOW BEEN LIMITED TO 140  CHARACTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND MOST IMPORTANTLY NEVIL  LONGBOTTOM NOW LOOKS LIKE THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT  THAT IS A REAL MESSAGE OF HOPE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, ANOTHER BIG CHANGE IS THAT  THANKS TO TED TALKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- ALL THE REAL SMARTY PEOPLE  WITH THE CUTTING EDGE IDEAS ARE  NOW LEGALLY REQUIRED TO USE A HEADSET MICROPHONE WHEN CHANGING  THE WORLD WITH THOUGHT. WHY? WELL, OBSERVE HOW IT FREES UP MY  HANDS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I CAN COMMUNICATE HOW  TOGETHER WE CAN REFRAME THE  ISSUES AND SHIFT THE PARADIGM SO THAT WE CAN PULL OURSELVES -- [LAUGHTER] -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] INTO A BRIGHTER TOMORROW. [ LAUGHTER ] AND TODAY, HERE, AT THE CLINTON  GLOBAL INITIATIVE I'M PROUD TO  ANNOUNCE THE BIRTH OF A BRAND NEW CGI, THE COLBERT GALACTIC  INITIATIVE. THANK YOU. VERY EXCITED. YOU ARE THE FIRST TO KNOW. DON'T GET ME WRONG GLOBAL IS  GOOD. IT'S CUTE, BABY STEPS. I'M JUST THINKING A LITTLE BIT  BIGGER. I ASSUME MANY OF YOU HERE IN  THIS ROOM ARE HERE FOR THE  CLINTON GLOBAL UNIVERSEITY. CGIU IS A PLACE WHERE YOUNG  PEOPLE LIKE US CAN PRESENT -- [LAUGHTER] IT'S FUN TO BE YOUNG LIKE US,  ISN'T IT? COMPANY PRESENT BOLD AND FRESH  IDEAS. I FOR ONE SALUTE YOUR  COMMITMENT. YOU ARE HERE DEVELOPING THEORIES  THAT WILL ONE DAY SOLVE THE  WORLD'S PROBLEMS WHILE YOUR CLASSMATES ARE ON SPRING BREAK  DEVELOPING THEORIES AS TO WHY  THEY WOKE UP IN A HOT TUB NEXT TO SOMEONE WEARING NOTHING BUT A  HORSE MASK. BUT JUST PRAISING YOU IS NOT THE  ONLY REASON I'M HERE. NO. IN JUST A MOMENT YOU'LL WITNESS  A MEETING OF TWO GLOBAL LEADERS. [ LAUGHTER ] ONE A STATESMAN WHO CHANGED THE  WORLD CLITICLY AND CULTURAL, THE  OTHER BILL CLINTON. [ LAUGHTER ] I FOR ONE AM AWED BY THE  GREATNESS ABOUT TO APPEAR ON  STAGE AND I AM HALF OF IT. [ LAUGHTER ] AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS CHART  TECHNICALLY I AM 51% OF THE  GREATNESS. BUT ENOUGH TALK IT'S TIME FOR  CONVERSATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE  JOIN ME IN WELCOMING THE MAN  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LAST GOVERNMENT SURPLUS, THE MOST  BELOVED LIVING PRESIDENT OTHER  THAN MARTIN SHEEN AND MY FUTURE CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND, PRESIDENT  WILLIAM JEFFERSON, BILLY JEFF  CLINTON.

Jon: I HAD TO GIVE THEM  ANOTHER TASTE OF ME. THEY DESERVE IT. MR. PRESIDENT, WELCOME TO THE  COLBERT GALACTIC INITIATIVE ON  ITS INAUGURAL NIGHT. THIS VEALY IMPRESSIVE.
Stephen: THANK YOU. WE PUT IT TOGETHER QUICKLY.
ONE OF THE THINGS ON MY  BUCKET LIST I JUST ADDED  SOMETHING, CLIMBING KILIMANJARO BEFORE THE SNOWS MELT, RIDING A  HORSE ACROSS THE GOBI DESERT AND  NOW I WANT TO GO INTO OUTER SPACE ON ONE OF YOUR SPACESHIPS.
Stephen: IF YOU'LL PROVIDE  THE FUNDING I'LL FIND SOMEBODY  TO BUILD IT.
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY TELL  MS. HE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: WILLIAM JEFFERSON  CLINTON MAY I CALL YOU BILLY  JEFF.
ONCE THE PRESIDENT LEAVES  OFFICE, YOU CAN CALL HIM  ANYTHING YOU LIKE.
Stephen: REALLY. I'M HONORED. [LAUGHTER] BEFORE WE START A COUPLE OF  GROUND RULES, ALL RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: I'M HERE IN THIS  VENUE AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY  WE'RE BROADCASTING RIGHT NOW ON THE COLBERT REPORT. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT  PROGRAM?
I AM.
Stephen: THIS IS NOT  CHARLIE ROSE, BUDDY. I'M GOING TO BRING IT HOT. I'M GOING TO BRING IT HARD WITH  A SIDE OF TRUTH. HERE ARE THE RULES. IF YOU START FILIBUSTERING, I  WILL CUT YOU OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW I COULD ASK  YOU HOW YOU ARE DOING AND 15  MINUTES LATER YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MICROLOANS TO SUMATRA. SECOND. WE'RE MILES AWAY POLITCALLY FROM  EACH OTHER. SO, IF I FIND MYSELF AGREEING  WITH YOU BECAUSE OF THE FAMED  CLINTON CHARISMA, I WILL CONTINUE THE INTERVIEW STARING  INTO A HAND MIRROR. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE YOU ARE THE MEDUSA OF  POLITICAL PERSUASIVENESS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
I DO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. SO WE'RE ALL SET. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.
I'M GLAD TO BE HERE AND GLAD  TO BE WITH YOU AND YOUR MIRROR.
Stephen: THANK YOU. [LAUGHTER] SIR, THE CLINTON GLOBAL  INITIATIVE GETS SO MUCH DONE BUT  MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU IS WHY HELP OTHER PEOPLE? [LAUGHTER] WEIGHS IN IT FOR YOU?
I WANT TO LEAVE MY DAUGHTER  AND GRANDCHILDREN I HOPE TO HAVE  AND ALL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE A BETTER WORLD. I THINK THE REASON YOU SHOULD DO  THINGS FOR OTHER PEOPLE AT  BOTTOM IS SELFISH. THERE'S NO REAL DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN SELLISH AND SELFLESS IF  YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THE WORLD  WORKS. WE'RE TIED TOGETHER.
Stephen: THERE'S NO  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SELFISH AND  SELFLESS?
NOT IF YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THE  WORLD WORKS. WE LIVE IN AN INTERDEPENDENT  WORLD. SUPPOSE YOU ARE IN AMERICA AND  WORRIED ABOUT GROWTH TO THE  AMERICAN ECONOMY. WE'RE 4% OF THE WORLD'S  POPULATION. WE HAVE 20% OF INCOME. THE MORE YOU REDUCE POVERTY  OVERSEAS, THE MORE YOU INCREASE  EDITION AND IMPROVE HEALTH CARE AND EMPOWER WOMEN AND GIRLS, THE  MORE THERE'S GROWTH OVERSEAS,  THERE'S GLOBAL GROWTH AND THE BETTER OFF AMERICANS WILL BE. IF EVERY TIME YOU CUT OFF  SOMEBODY ELSE'S OPPORTUNITIES  YOU SHRINK YOUR OWN.
Stephen: WHY GLOBAL  INITIATIVE? WHY NOT CALL IT THE CLINTON  AMERICA INITIATIVE. SHOULDN'T WE FIX EVERYTHING HERE  FIRST? U.S.A. NUMBER ONE FIRST. THAT'S THE FIRST LINE OF  CONSTITUTION. [ LAUGHTER ]
WE SHOULD BE FIXING AMERICA  AND IT SHOULD BE THE ECONOMIC  PRIORITY BUT YOU CAN'T STOP THE WORLD, GET OFF AND GET ON WHEN  YOU GET GOOD AND READY. OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE  UNFOLDING AND FIXING AMERICA IN  PART DEPENDS UPON HAVING A MORE RECEPTIVE WORLD TO IMPROVE IN,  ONE THAT MAKES OUR GROWTH MORE  RELEVANT AND MORE EFFECTIVE. IT DOESN'T COST A LOT OF MONEY. WE GIVE A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF  OUR INCOME IN FOREIGN  ASSISTANCE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DOES, THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR  COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.
Stephen: BUT THIS IS ONE OF  THE CUTOFFS I'M GOING TO DO  HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE ASSISTANCE WE GIVE IS  BETTER ASSISTANCE BECAUSE IT'S  AMERICA DOING IT. WHY DO WE HAVE TO MATCH THE REST  OF THE WORLD? WHO WANTS HELP FROM SWEDEN?
FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT SURE IT  IS BETTER.
Stephen: YOU JUST SAID  AMERICA'S ASSISTANCE IS NOT  BETTER THAN OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU ARE SAYING HELP FROM BELGIUM  IS AS GOOD AS HELP FROM THE  UNITED STATES.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I SAID THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF  OTHER COUNTRIES WHO ALSO DO  ASSISTANCE VERY WELL AND SOME OF THEM DO IT BY GIVING A HIGHER  PERCENTAGE OF THEIR DOLLARS OR  THEIR EQUIVALENT CURRENCY IN THE COUNTRY THAN WE DO.
Stephen: AT THE CORE OF THE  QUESTION IS WHY DO YOU IT. YOU SPENT EIGHT YEARS AS  PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES. YOU'VE ALREADY HAD A BIG JOB BUT  SINCE YOU LEFT YOU STARTED THE  CLINTON FOUNDATION, GLOBAL INITIATIVE, CLINTON HEALTH  ACCESS INITIATIVE, CLINTON  ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVE, CLIMATE INITIATIVE AND MORE I  CAN'T FIT HERE. AREN'T YOU -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GO AHEAD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHY AREN'T YOU EXHAUSTED? I'M 20 YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU  ARE AND I'M OUT OF BREATH FROM  LISTING WHAT YOU DO.
WELL, WHEN YOU GET OLDER YOU  HAVE MORE TIME TO WORK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE A  JEDI MIND TRICK. WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?
YOU HAVE THREE KIDS, RIGHT?
Stephen: I HAVE THREE  CHILDREN, YES.
WHEN THEY ARE ALL OUT OF  COLLEGE YOU'LL HAVE MORE TIME TO  WORK.
Stephen: OH, I GUESS SO,  YEAH. I WORK PRETTY HARD NOW THOUGH. ARE YOU SAYING YOU WORK HARDER  NOW THAN YOU WERE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES? IF SO, SHOULDN'T YOU GIVE US OUR  MONEY BACK?
I DON'T THINK I WORK HARDER  NOW BUT I WORK ABOUT AS HARD.
Stephen: MR. PRESIDENT, WE  HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK. CAN YOU STICK AROUND?
I'LL DO IT.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK WITH
