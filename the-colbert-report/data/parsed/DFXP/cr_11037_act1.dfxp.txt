(EAGLE CAW)
Stephen: TONIGHT, IS AMERICA GUILTY OF TORTURE? NO, WE SEEM FINE WITH IT. THEN HACKERS EXPOSE HOLLYWOOD SECRETS. IT TURNS OUT APOLLO 13 TOOK PLACE ON A SOUND STAGE! AND MY GUEST, SETH ROGEN, STARS WITH JAMES FRANCO IN THE NEW MOVIE "THE INTERVIEW". I'LL ASK HIM ALL ABOUT IT IN  TONIGHT'S "INTERVIEW" INTERVIEW. A NEW YORK HIGH SCHOOLER MADE $72 MILLION TRADING STOCKS ON HIS LUNCH HOUR. IN A COUPLE MORE YEARS,  HE MIGHT HAVE ENOUGH TO PAY FOR COLLEGE. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") THAT'S PURE, UNCUT IT-GETTING THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE! WHAT A JOY! WHAT A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TONIGHT, FOLKS! (CHEERING) YOU KNOW, I LOVE BEING WITH YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THE NEWS LATELY, FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THE NEWS, YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS -- (CHEERING) -- FOLKS, THIS IS MY LAST WEEK HERE AT "THE REPORT." (AWWWWW) I'M SORRY. DID NO ONE TELL YOU? BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE STEPPING DOWN FROM THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT. SO IS MINNESOTA CONGRESSWOMAN AND WAX FIGURE OF MICHELE BACHMANN, MICHELE BACHMANN. MICHELE HAS DECIDED NOT TO SEEK A FIFTH TERM, OPTING INSTEAD TO STAY HOME AND CATCH UP ON HER BLINKING. BUT I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT BACHMANN'S NOT GOING QUIETLY. LAST WEEK, AS SHE AND HER FAMILY POSED FOR A PICTURE AT THE WHITE HOUSE HOLIDAY PARTY, BACHMANN TURNED TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SAID,"MR. PRESIDENT, YOU NEED TO BOMB THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR FACILITIES BECAUSE, IF YOU DON'T, IRAN WILL HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON ON YOUR WATCH." NOW SOME MAY SAY THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE FOR A HOLIDAY PARTY, BUT SHE'S CONSISTENT. BACHMANN SAYS  THE SAME THING ON ALL OF HER CHRISTMAS CARDS. BESIDES, HOLIDAY PARTY OR NOT, BACHMANN KNOWS IT'S CRUCIAL TO KEEP IRAN FROM GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE IN HIGH-STAKES BINGO.
Stephen: AND BINGO, OF COURSE, THE ULTIMATE HIGH-STAKES GAME. JUST LOOK AT HOW THE STRESS OF BINGO AGES THE PLAYERS. THAT GIRL IS 17 YEARS OLD AND HOW DID OBAMA RESPOND TO HER SAGE FOREIGN POLICY ADVICE? ACCORDING TO BACHMANN, THE PRESIDENT "LAUGHED AT ME AND SAID, 'WELL, MICHELE, IT'S JUST NOT THAT EASY .'" (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT SURPRISED HE LAUGHED. LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT'S ACTUAL REACTION TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I TOLD HIM HE SHOULD LISTEN TO MICHELE BACHMANN. (LAUGHTER) GOD SPEED. GOD SPEED, MICHELE. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KEPT UP THAT CRAZY CONSERVATIVE CHARACTER FOR EIGHT YEARS. OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY CONTINUES TO BE THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE'S TORTURE REPORT. FOLKS, AMERICA IS A BEACON OF FREEDOM AROUND THE WORLD. BUT THANKS TO THIS REPORT, NOW BRUTAL REGIMES ARE TALKING SMACK -- LIKE THIS CRAP FROM CHINA. "HOW LONG CAN THE U.S. PRETEND TO BE A HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION?" OH, I DON'T KNOW, I'D SAY ABOUT AS LONG AS I CAN PRETEND I DON'T KNOW WHO MADE MY iPhone. IT'S ELVES, RIGHT? THESE ARE TROUBLING QUESTIONS, AND IN TROUBLED TIMES, BILL O'REILLY REMINDS US TO SHUT UP AND LET HIM TALK.
THERE ARE SOME FOLKS LIKE ME WHO BELIEVE WE MUST USE HARSH MEASURES TO DEFEAT THE JIHADISTS WHO WOULD SLAUGHTER US ALL IF THEY COULD. THERE ARE OTHERS WHO SAY WE MUST OBEY THE GENEVA CONVENTION, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE FIGHTING AN ENEMY THAT DOES NOT FALL UNDER THAT TREATY. THEN THERE IS THE DEFINITION OF TORTURE. SOME BELIEVE THAT SUBJECTING A CAPTIVE TO LOUD NOISE OR VERBAL THREATS IS TORTURE.
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY, A DEBATE THAT CANNOT BE DEBATED BECAUSE MINDS WILL NOT BE CHANGED CAN BE DEBATED ONLY BY THE MOST UNCHANGEABLE MIND. ME, STEPHEN COLBERT! THIS IS FORMIDABLE OPPONENT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST OF ALL, WELCOME, STEPHEN.
GOOD TO BE BACK.
Stephen: STEPHEN, I LOOKED IT UP, AND YOU AND I DEBATED TORTURING DETAINEES IN THE VERY FIRST MONTH OF THIS SHOW MORE THAN NINE YEARS AGO.
NINE YEARS? WOW, YOU HAVEN'T AGED A BIT.
Stephen: AWWW... YOU'RE A LIAR.
I AM. YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.
Stephen: I KNOW! 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN UP FOR ALMOST A WEEK READING ABOUT HOW WE KEPT PRISONERS UP FOR ALMOST A WEEK. YOU LOOK SO WELL-RESTED. WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?
I'LL SHOW YOU. GIMME THAT THING
OK, HEAR YOU GO (CHEERING) NOW YOU WILL SLEEP LIKE A BABY.
Stephen: NO, I WON'T! SOME PARTS OF THAT REPORT ARE REALLY DISTURBING!
WHICH PARTS?
Stephen: THE WORDS. CHAINING AND BEATING, CONFINEMENT IN COFFIN-SIZED BOXES, SOMETHING CALLED "RECTAL REHYDRATION"?
WELL, C'MON, MAN, NO ONE LIKES A THIRSTY RECTUM.
Stephen: GRANTED. I JUST DON'T LIKE TO THINK OF AMERICA AS A TORTURE NATION.
WE'RE NOT. WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS. IT'S JUST THAT, AFTER 9/11, OUR FEAR AND ANGER TEMPORARILY CHANGED US INTO A DIFFERENT GUY.
Stephen: OH! LIKE THE INCREDIBLE HULK?
EXACTLY. DON'T MAKE US ANGRY. YOU WOULDN'T LIKE US WHEN WE'RE ANGRY. BUT NOW WE'RE BACK TO BEING BRUCE BANNER, SO WE CAN'T BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE HULK'S HARSH INTERROGATION METHODS.
Stephen: OR HIS TINY PANTS. YEAH, AND AS USUAL, BILL O'REILLY PUT IT MOST --
LOOK, WE'RE FIGHTING A WAR. I HAVE A BOOK ON WORLD WAR II, "KILLING PATTON," SO I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. BAD THINGS HAPPEN IN WAR. THE TRUTH IS MISTAKES WERE MADE, BUT THEY WERE MADE IN THE FOG OF WAR TO PROTECT AMERICANS.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO MISS THAT GOOD MAN.
HE'S NOT GOING OFF THE AIR. YOU ARE.
Stephen: YEAH, BUT NO ONE'S GONNA PAY ME TO WATCH HIM ANYMORE. SO (BLEEP) THAT NOISE. (APPLAUSE)
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THOUGH, BILL IS RIGHT. YOU CAN'T JUDGE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE "FOG OF WAR."
Stephen: WHAT FOG? THIS WASN'T LOW-LEVEL TROOPS MAKING SPLIT-SECOND DECISIONS IN A FREE-FIRE ZONE. IT WAS OVER SEVEN YEARS OF LAWYERS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT WRITING LEGAL BRIEFS ABOUT SIMULATED DROWNING...
SORRY, STEPHEN. I CAN'T HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. IT'S TOO DAMN "FOG OF WAR" IN HERE.
Stephen: YOU CAN'T HEAR ME BECAUSE IT'S FOGGY?
CAN'T HEAR YOU! FOGGY!
Stephen: YOU'RE HOLDING A (BLEEP) FOG MACHINE!
OH, THIS? I DIDN'T SEE THAT BECAUSE OF THE "FOG OF FOG."
Stephen: LOOK, FOG OR NO FOG, WE SAID WE DON'T TORTURE, AND NOW THE WORLD THINKS WE'RE THE BAD GUYS.
THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT. THINK OF IT THIS WAY, EVERYBODY THINKS YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON, RIGHT?
Stephen: I CERTAINLY HOPE SO. BUT WHAT IF SOMEONE FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED "THAT" SUMMER UP AT MAYFLOWER LAKE?
Stephen: WE AGREED WE WOULD NEVER TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT MAYFLOWER LAKE.
EXACTLY, BECAUSE WE'RE GOOD PEOPLE, AND NOTHING HAPPENED, BECAUSE IT HAD TO.
Stephen: RIGHT. MR. JENKINS SLIPPED AND HIT HIS HEAD ON THAT ROCK TO PROTECT THE OTHER KIDS.
YES, THE ROCK, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA.
Stephen: AND WE AGREED ON THAT STORY AND SEALED IT WITH THE MAYFLOWER PREP SECRET HANDSHAKE.
MAYFLOWER BOYS DO NOT  MURDER...
Stephen: AND WILL NOT DISCUSS IT FURTHER...
PA-CHANG! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) POINT IS -- AMERICA DOES NOT TORTURE. BUT WE "HAD" TO. AND WE'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN, UNLESS IT'S TO PROTECT AMERICA.
Stephen: BUT THE REPORT SAYS IT DIDN'T PROTECT AMERICA.
OH, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ACTUAL COUNTRY. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE "IDEA" OF AMERICA. THE "IDEA" OF AMERICA WOULD NEVER TORTURE.
Stephen: AND THE ACTUAL AMERICA?
HAVE YOU READ THAT REPORT? WE PUMPED HUMMUS UP PEOPLE'S BUTTS. I'M NO IMAN, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S NOT HALAL. THAT, MY FRIEND, IS WHY I CHOSE TO LIVE IN THE "IDEA" OF AMERICA.
Stephen: AH-HA! BUT THE IDEA OF AMERICA IS JUST AN IMAGINARY PLACE. WHICH MEANS YOU, SIR, ARE JUST AN IMAGINARY STEPHEN COLBERT.
AND YOU,  SIR... (FADING AWAY)
-- HAVE BEEN A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT!
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
