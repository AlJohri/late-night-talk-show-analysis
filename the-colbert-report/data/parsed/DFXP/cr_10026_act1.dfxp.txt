(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE HAVE A SET. WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON THIS BRIGHT EVENING. NATION, AMERICA WAS BUILT ON TWO THINGS: A STRONG WORK ETHIC AND INDIAN BONES. (LAUGHTER) BUT MOSTLY THE HARD WORK. THAT'S WHY AS A MAKER I AM SICK OF THE LOW-DMK TAKERS OUT THERE ALWAYS ASKING FOR MORE.
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING, THEY NEED A LIVING WAGE, THEY CAN'T SURVIVE OFF THE $7 OR $8 AN HOUR.
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS STILL NOT A LIVING WAGE.
TODAY THE MINIMUM WAGE IS LESS THAN WHAT IT WAS IN 1963.
Stephen: WELL, THAT JUST MEANS THE MINIMUM WAGE IS I HAVEN'TAGE. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO WAGES THERE'S NO COMPANY THE GREEDY UNDERCLASS LOVES TO ATTACK MORE THAN WAL-MART. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM THEM IN? THEY ALREADY GIVES YOU AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO PLUS-SIZE KAMO BATHROBES. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, FOR WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE KICKING BACK AND HUNTING. (LAUGHTER) BESIDES, WAL-MART HAS PROVEN THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR LOW-WAGE WORKERS.
ONE STORE IN OHIO IS COLLECTING FOOD FOR EMPLOYEES. THE STORE SET UP SOME STORAGE BINS WITH A SIGN THAT READ "PLEASE DONATE FOOD ITEMS HERE IS THAT ASSOCIATES-- THAT'S WHAT WAL-MART CALLS ITS EMPLOYEES-- IN NEED CAN ENJOY THANKSGIVING DINNER." (AUDIENCE REACTS) WAL-MART CALLS THE FOOD DRIVE PROOF OF ITS EFFORT TO TAKE CARE OF EMPLOYEES. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: THANK YOU, RABBI. (LAUGHTER) YOU SEE, WAL-MART IS TAKING CARE OF ITS EMPLOYEES! NOT LIVING WAGE CARE BUT CAN OF PEAS CARE. (LAUGHTER) NOW SOT CRITICS OUT THERE ARE SAYING WAL-MART ISN'T DOING ENOUGH BUT THEY'RE WRONG BECAUSE WAL-MART ISN'T DOING ANYTHING! (LAUGHTER) THESE BINS ARE FOR WAL-MART EMPLOYEES TO DONATE TO OTHER EMPLOYEES. (LAUGHTER) AND WHERE CAN WAL-MART'S LOW-WAGE WORKERS FIND CHEAP FOOD TO DONATE? WAL-MART. (LAUGHTER) ANYONE CAN AFFORD FOOD THERE-- EXPEPT PEOPLE WHO WORK AT WAL-MART. (LAUGHTER) WHY STOP AT FOOD? WAL-MART CAN STOP OFFERING HEALTH INSURANCE IF THEY JUST SET UP A "PLEASE VACCINATE MY CHILD BIN." (LAUGHTER) AND THEY MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE THE EMPLOYEE DESK FROM "HOW MAY I HELP YOU" TO JUST "HELP." (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT IS DOES NOT NEED ANY HELP THROUGHOUT? THE STOCK MARKET.
THE DOW IS UP 22%. THE NASDAQ UP 31%. THE S&P 500 UP 26%. THE INDEX HAS GAINED MORE THAN 3 POINTS THIS YEAR ALONE. THE S&P 500 MOVED ABOVE 1800 FOR THE FIRST TIME.
STOCK PRICES HIT NEW MILESTONES TODAY. THE DOW TRADED ABOVE 16,000 FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.
Stephen: YES, THE DOW SET A NEW RECORD MEANING IT GOT TO ENTER ITS INITIALS ON THE HIGH-SCORE SCREEN. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THAT RECORD HIGH IS GOOD FOR EVERYBODY, ESPECIALLY WETIEST 5% OF AMERICANS WHO OWN 82% OF ALL STOCKS! THE OTHER 95% HAVE THEIR MONEY INVESTED MOSTLY IN BEANIE BABIES AND DONATED CANNED GOODS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOT OF WAL-MART FANS HERE TONIGHT. BUT NOW SOCIALIST COMMISSARS OVER AT THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" ARE SAYING THE GULF BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVE-NOTS MAY HURT THE ECONOMY. WELL, THAT'S EXAGGERATING. A GULF? MY GATED COMMUNITY ONLY HAS A MOAT. (LAUGHTER) NO SURPRISE THE REST OF THE RED BRIGADE IS JOINING IN. LIKE THAT MANAGER OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST BOND FUND WILLIAM GROSS.
ORDINARY FOLKS, THE 99%, DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY ANYMORE! THE RICH 1% AND CORPORATIONS DO. DEVELOPED ECONOMIES WORK BEST WHEN INEQUALITY AND INCOMES ARE AT A MINIMUM.
Stephen: THAT IS A SOBERING THOUGHT. METAPHORICALLY, OF COURSE. AS SOON AS I HEARD IT I GOT DRUNK. (LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS I'M CHOOSING TO BELIEVE THAT INCOME INEQUALITY ISN'T AS BIG A DEAL AND DOESN'T NEED TO CHANGE. HERE TO TELL ME IT IS A BIG DEAL AND NEEDS TO CHANGE IS FORMER LABOR SECRETARY FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON AND STAR OF THE NEW DOCUMENTARY "INEQUALITY FOR ALL" ROBERT REICH. MR. REICH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU WERE ON THE SHOW ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO SOUNDING THE ALARM WARNING IF WE DIDN'T DO SOMETHING IT WOULD TANK ECONOMY OR CAUSE A REVOLUTION. THREE YEARS LATER I'M RICHER THAN EVER. I ASSUME YOU'RE BACK HERE TO APOLOGIZE.
NO, I DIDN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHEN IT WOULD TANK THE ECONOMY AND CAUSE A REVOLUTION. I SAID IF WE CONTINUE IN THE SAME DIRECTION IT'S DANGEROUS FOR THE ECONOMY AND DANGEROUS FOR OUR DEMOCRACY AND I STILL THINK IT IS VERY DANGEROUS.
Stephen: HOW DID IT CAUSE AN ECONOMIC COLLAPSE? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ME HAVING ALL THE MONEY IS A BAD THING.
MOST AMERICANS, THE VAST MIDDLE-CLASS AND THE POOR DON'T THE PURCHASING POWER TO THE ECONOMY GOING WHICH IS WHY THIS RECOVERY IS THE MOST ANEMIC RECOVERY ON RECORD.
Stephen: HOW LONG UNTIL THIS REACHES A CRISIS POINT? IF WE HOLD OFF LONG ENOUGH I MAY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO START MY OWN ECONOMY AND BLOW THIS ONE OFF.
WELL, SOME PEOPLE ARE SO WEALTHY THAT THEY ARE LEAVING THE UNITED STATES AND THEY ARE SETTING UP TAX HAVENS ABROAD AND THEY ARE IN EFFECT SETTING UP THEIR OWN ECONOMY.
Stephen: AND WHERE ARE THEY GOING? CAN YOU GIVE ME A LIST OF ANY PLACES? JUST GENERAL IDEAS?
WHY DON'T YOU TRY THE NETHERLANDS. THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD PLACE. BUT MOST AMERICANS AND MOST PEOPLE AND MOST COUNTRIES ARE STAYING PUT AND THEY RELY ON AN ECONOMY THAT'S GROWING FOR EVERYBODY. WE DID HIT IN THE THREE DECADES AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR, THERE'S NO REASON WE CANNOT DO IT AGAIN.
Stephen: WHOSE FAULT IS THIS? IS THIS OBAMA'S FAULT?
IT IS NOT OBAMA'S FAULT.
Stephen: OBAMACARE. I MEANT OBAMACARE. IS IT OBAMACARE'S FAULT?
NO, THIS IS NOT THE PART OF OBAMACARE. THE PROBLEM HERE HAS BEEN GROWING FOR THREE DECADES. WE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE IT BECAUSE WE BASICALLY TURNED OUR BACKS ON THE PROBLEM.
Stephen: AS A RICH PERSON, I'M GETTING A LITTLE SCARED THAT THE POORS MAY COME AND TAKE WHAT I HAVE THERE'S ONLY 1% OF US. WE'RE AN OPPRESSED MINORITY.
STEPHEN, DO NOT BE SCARED. IF, IN FACT, WE HAVE A MORE EQUITABLE SOCIETY WHERE MORE PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE IT, WHERE THERE'S A WIDER CIRCLE OF PROSPERITY YOU ARE GOING TO DO BETTER, I GUARANTEE IT.
Stephen: THAT A MONEY-BACK GUERIN SEE IN
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY MONEY BACK, NO.
Stephen: WHAT IF THE POOR OR MIDDLE-CLASS HAD SOMETHING THAT WE RICH PEOPLE WANTED TO BUY? YOU KNOW? SURELY THEY HAVE PLENTIFUL ORGANS AND DAUGHTERS. ISN'T THERE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD PURCHASE FROM THEM SO THEY CAN GET MONEY?
YES, WELL, YOU COULD PURCHASE -- WE COULD HAVE A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS TO TURN AROUND AND BUY STUFF WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE YOU AND OTHERS LIKE YOU EVEN BETTER.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE ANSWER IN TEN WORDS OR LESS-- AND DO NOT MAKE ANY OF THEM THE WORD "TAXES. (LAUGHTER)
INVEST MORE AND BETTER IN OUR SCHOOLS AND IN HIGHER EDUCATION. GET BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS. AND TRY TO GET MORE REVENUES FROM THE RICH.
Stephen: IS MORE THAN FAIR. (LAUGHTER)
I'LL DO IT AGAIN. GET MORE REVENUES FROM THE VERY RICH, USE IT FOR BETTER SCHOOLS AND HIGHER EDUCATION AND GET BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT KNOW THAT'S MORE THAN TEN TWICE NOW. THE THAT'S JUST ANOTHER TAX AND TALK TOO MUCH LIBERAL.
GET BIG MONEY -- HOW ABOUT GET BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS?
Stephen: GET BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS. OKAY, AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT GETTING BIG MONEY OUT OF ME. WELL, MR. REICH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME TONIGHT. ROBERT REICH, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
