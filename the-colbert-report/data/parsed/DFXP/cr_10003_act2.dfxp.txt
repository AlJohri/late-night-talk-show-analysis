Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS VERY MUCH. FOLKS, YOU KNOW I AM A HUGE FAN OF PAPA BEAR BILL O'REILLY. BILL IS MY MENT OR, HE OR, INSPIRATION. MY SAFEWORD. OF COURSE YOU DON'T BECOME A LEGEND WITHOUT MAKE SOMETHING ENEMIES, AND I'M AFRAID THE KING IS ONCE AGAIN UNDER ATTACK. THIS IS BLOOD IN THE WATER.
SHARK, SHARK. SHARK-SHARK-SHARK. SHARK.
Stephen:  FOLKS. LAST SUNDAY NIGHT, LAST SUNDAY BILL WAS ON "60 MINUTES" TO DISCUSS HIS NEW BOOK "KILLING JESUS." SORRY, CHRISTIANS. SPOILER ALERT. IT IS THE LATEST IN HIS KILLING SERIES FOLLOWING "KILLING KENNEDY," "KILLING LINCOLN," AND HIS CHILDREN'S BOOK, "KILLING CLIFFORD." TURNS OUT THE BIG RED PUPPY HAD A CASE OF GIGANTIC RABIES AND HAD TO BE PUT DOWN. SAD, BUT TRUE. NOW, BILL WASTED NO TIME ANSWERING THE QUESTION THAT WAS ON EVERYBODY'S MIND-- WHY DID YOU WRITE THIS BOOK?
HOW DID THE IDEA COME TO YOU?
ALL OF THE IDEAS COME TO ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. AND ONE NIGHT, I JUST WOKE UP AND WENT "KILLING JESUS." AND I BELIEVE, BECAUSE I'M A CATHOLIC, THAT COMES FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT.
YOU BELIEVE THE HOLY SPIRIT DIRECTED YOU TO WRITE "KILLING JESUS"?
YES, I BELIEVE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  YES. YES.   ( APPLAUSE ) AS A CATHOLIC, BILL BELIEVES IN THE TRINITY. THIS CASE, THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY GHOST WRITER. ( LAUGHTER ) BILL KNOWS HE IS SIMPLY GOD'S HUMBLE SERVANT.
AND WHY WOULD THE HOLY SPIRIT CHOOSE YOU?
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO SPECULATE ABOUT THEIDATEY.
WELL, YOU ARE SUGGESTING YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE.
I'M NOT THE CHOSEN ONE. I'M JUST ONE OF MANY WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN GIFTS.
Stephen:  VERY IMPORTANT. BILL IS NOT SAYING HE'S THE CHOSEN ONE. HE'S JUST AVERAGE JOE, PROPHET OF GOD. YOUR JEREMIAH, YOUR ZACH RYE, YOUR BILLOREIYAH. HE SIMPLY SAYS-- THAT'S ALL HE'S SAYING. GOD CHOSE HIM. HE SIMPLY SPEAKS FOR THE ALMIGHTY. WHO COULD FORGET WHEN YAHWEH SPAKETH TO THE ISRAELITES.
WHAT WORDS CAN I SPEAK THAT WILL HEED ( BLEEP ).
WE'LL DO IT LIVE! ( BLEEP ). SUCK!
Stephen:  THIS IS THE WORD OF THE LORD. OF COURSE, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED O'REILLY FROM ALL SIDES WITH HUNDREDS OF ONE ARTICLE BY SOME GUY IN FILL NAMED HOWARD. AND, BOY, DID ST. BILLY BURN HIS BUSH.
MOCKERY IN THE SECULAR PRESS BEGAN--
WRITING IN THE "PHILADELPHIA DAILY NEWS" HOWARD GENSLERS WROTE, "BILL O'REILLY HAZE GOD TOLD HIM TO WRITE HIS NEW BOOK "KILLING GEEZ US, A HISTORY." HE SAYS IT'S ALL PART OF GOD'S PLAN TO HIM. DID GOD ALSO GIVE YOU THE IDEA FOR PIN HEADS AND PATRIOTS? FOR SURE, HOWARD. SO I CAN DESIGNATE YOU AS A PIN HEAD. BUT THIS GOES WAY BEYOND THAT, DOESN'T, IT, HOWARD PUP ARE MOCK,ING MY CHRISTIAN FAITH.
Stephen:  YOU ARE MOCKING HIS CHRISTIAN FACE. THIS IS FILLED WITH THE RULE OF CHRISTIANITY. RULE NUMBER ONE, NO FORGIVENESS ( BLEEP )! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JESUS HIMSELF SAID YOU CROSS ME, A CUT A... THE SUREST EVIDENCE GOD TOLD BILL O'REILLY TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUTIOD GOD, ACCORDING TO BILL O'REILLY, IT'S MORE ACCURATE THAN GOLD'S BOOK ABOUT GOD.
YOU INCLUDE TWO QUOTE FROM JESUS ON THE CROSS, BUT NOT THE MOST FAMOUS ONE, "FATHER FORGIVE THEM. FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO." WHY NOT?
WE DON'T PUT IN THINGS THAT WE DON'T THINK HAPPENED.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT AUDIBLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD HEAR. HE-- ( LAUGHTER ) HE DIED ON THE CROSS BEING SUFFOCATED. YOUR LUNGS CAN'T TAKE IN ANY MORE AIR. YOU CAN HARDLY BREATHE. WE BELIEVE JESUS SAID THAT BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE HE SAID IT ON THE CROSS BECAUSE NOBODY COULD HAVE HEARD IT.
Stephen:  YET, WALKING ON WATER, RISING FROM THE DEAD, JESUS CAN HANDLE IT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT TALKING LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD? NOW YOU'RE ON BILL'S TURF. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ). AND, FOLKS, INFORMATION I GOTTA TELL YOU BILL'S NOT THE ONLY PUNDIT WHO TALKS TO THE LORD. EVERY ONE OF MY BOOKS HAS BEEN DWIENL INSPIRED. FOR INSTANCE, BEFORE I WROTE MY THIRD BOOK GOD CAME TO ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND HE SAID, "HEY, STEVE, IF YOU WRITE ANOTHER BOOK, YOU COULD PROBABLY AFFORD NEW DECKING ON YOUR SAILBOATS, AND, LO IT HAS COME TOPAZ. FOLKS, I WANT TO TELL YOU I AM VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS POWER. I ALSO MAKE SURE THE VOICE IN MY SHOULD GOD'S. AFTER ALL, MY NEIGHBOR'S DOG ALSO TALKS TO ME IN MY SLEEP AND TELLS ME TO KILL PEOPLE BUT I IGNORE HIM BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOD. ALTHOUGH, ROSCO IS AN ORDAINED MINISTER. ( LAUGHTER ) I ALSO BELIEVE-- AND THIS IS JUST ME-- THAT--  ♪  ♪ HOLD ON, I'M GETTING SOMETHING FROM GOD RIGHT NOW. WHAT'S THAT? UH-HUH? UH-HUH? SHE SAID WHAT! WHAT DID YOU TELL HER? O-M-YOU. DID YOU NOT GO THERE! ARE YOU GRADE-ACRAZAZZY MY MAN. LONG STORY, JOAN OF ARC IS A DRAMA QUEEN. ANYWAY, I HATE TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE, BILL, BUT GOD TALKS TO ME BEFORE HE TALKS TO YOU. IN FACT, GOD PITCHED ME ON THIS WHOLE "KILLING JESUS" THING, AND WHEN I PASSED ON THE PROJECT-- SEEM DERIVATIVE-- HE ASKED ME TO TELL YOU. SO IN FACT IT WAS ME WHISPERING INTO YOUR EAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. I MEAN-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR? BILL, WRITE A BOOK ABOUT JESUS THAT'S MORE ACCURATE THAN THE BIBLE. ALSO, DON'T TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE VOICES YOU HEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BECAUSE THEY'LL THINK YOU'RE A CRAZY NARCISSIST. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
