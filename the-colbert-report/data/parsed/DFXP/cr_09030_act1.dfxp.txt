TONIGHT GUNS ALLOWED ON  COLLEGE CAMPUSES. NOW YOU REALLY DON'T WANT  TOO FACE THE FIGHTIN IRISH. THEN I GET SNUBBED BY A  MAJOR MAGAZINE. SHOCKING. THAT THERE IS STILL A MAJOR  MAGAZINE. (LAUGHTER)

I GOT TO TELL YOU, WHEN I  GET THAT KIND OF 4R06 FROM  YOU FOLKS I JUST WANT TO GO UP INTO THE STANDS AND  CRADLE YOU IN MY ARMS LIKE A  BABY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS YOU KNOW ME, YOU KNOW  MY BROADCASTING CA ROAR HAS  BEEN DEDICATED TO CELEBRATING AMERICAN  EXCEPTIONALISM. THAT SPECIAL JE NE SAI QUOI  THAT AMERICANS HAVE THAT  KEEP US FROM KNOWING THINGS LIKE WHAT JE NE SAIS QUOI  MEANS, I DON'T KNOW. BUT FOR SOME TIME NOW  AMERICANS HAVE BEEN IN  DECLINE. AND I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING  FOR THE EXACT MOMENT WHEN WE  WENT FROM BEING THE U.S. OF A TO THE U.S. OF EH. WELL, FOLKS, I THINK I FOUND  IT, FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS. AND INCIDENTALLY, IF ARE YOU  WEARING SEAT BELTS TO WATCH  TV, YOU'RE PART OF THE  PROBLEM.
IT SOUNDS PREPOSTEROUS  BUT THE UNITED STATES HAS TO  FACTOR INTO THE COLD WARE TO POSSIBLY NUKE THE MOON.
THEY SAY THE PLAN CALL  FORCE AN INTERCONTINENTAL  BALLISTIC MISSILE TO BE LAUNCHED FROM AN UNDISCLOSED  LOCATION, TRAVEL TO THE MOON  AND DETONATE ON IMPACT WITH THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD WARE,  SECURITY SCARES ALL AROUND,  AMERICAN LEADERS FELT THEY NEEDED TO GIVE A JOLT TO THE  SOVIET UNION.
Stephen: WE WERE GOING TO  NUKE THE MOON AND WE DIDN'T! (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS EARTH-SHATTERING NEWS. WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN  MOON SHATTERING NEWS. CLEARLY THIS, THIS MOMENT IS  WHEN AMERICA STEPPED BACK  FROM GREATNESS. OH, LET'S SEE, WHAT'S THE  BEST WAY TO SEND THE RESCU  RESCUE-- RUSS KEYES A  MESSAGE. A TENSE U.S. SECURITY  COUNCIL MEETING, NO, YOU  LIGHT UP THE GODDAMN MOON  WAY NUCLEAR HALOSO BRIGHT KRUSCHEV CAN READ PRAVDA AT  MIDNIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OH, AND WHAT  MILK TOAST NANCY PANTS  PUSSIED OUT ON OUR NUCLEAR LUNAR PROGRAM? EISENHOWER. SURE, IKE BEAT THE NAZIS BUT  WHAT ABOUT THE MOON NAZIES? OH, THEY DON'T EXIST? THAT'S JUST WHAT MOON HITLER  WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE. INSTEAD, INSTEAD WE CHOSE  LUNAR APPEASEMENT. AND IT IS JUST EMBOLDENED  THE MOON. I SWEAR LAST WEEK THAT THING  WAS HALF THE SIZE. THIS NATION, I SAY THIS  NATION MUST NUKE THE MOON  BEFORE IT CAN ACQUIRE  NUCLEAR WEAPONS OF ITS OWN. AND DON'T THINK IT ISN'T  TRYING BECAUSE WE KNOW IT IS  TEAMED UP WITH  FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAM. (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, IF YOU ASK ME, YOU  SHOULDN'T BE ASKING ME  BECAUSE I ASK THE QUESTIONS AROUND HERE. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG  OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NATION, ONE OF THE VERY  BIGGEST LOSERS OF THE RECENT  ELECTION WAS TRADITIONAL  MARRIAGE. YOU SEE THREE MORE STATES  LEGALIZED GAY MARRIAGE. NO SURPRISE THAT ONE OF THE  NEW STATES IS WASHINGTON. WHAT DOW EXPECT FROM A STATE  NAMED FOR A GUY WHO WEARS  Q-- CAPRI SLACKS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT ONE OF THE STATE'S  BIGGEST CORPORATIONS, BOEING,  A NAME SYNONYMOUS WITH AEROSPACE EXCELLENCE AND  BONNER SOUND EFFECTS HAS  INDICATED IN UNION CONTRACT  TALKS THAT THEY WILL DENY EQUAL PENSION BENEFITS TO  MARRIED GAY EMPLOYEES. HEY, HEY, YEAH, I'M ANGRY AT  THE GAYS TOO. HEY, GAY BOEING PLORX THE  ONLY MARRIAGE YOU SHOULD  HAVE IS TO YOUR JOB UNLESS  YOUR JOB IS IN THE COCKPIT. (LAUGHTER)  WELL-- FOLKS, TO COMMEMORATE  THIS REFRESHING DENIAL OF  HUMAN DIGNITY, I'M GIVING A TIP OF MY HADD TO BOEING FOR  BEING GAY RIGHTS PIONEERS. KUZ IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT  THIS IS GREAT FOR THE GAYS. IF COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO  PAY OUT SURVIVOR PENSIONS  FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES IT WILL SAVE THE MILLIONS. SOON EVERY COMPANY WILL WANT  THEM. THERE WILL BE A GAY JOB  EXPLOSION. BOY THE WAY DO NOT GOOGLE  THE TERM GAY JOB-- NATION,  THIS BLATANT DEVALUING OF  GAY PARTNERS IS GREAT FOR ANY COMPANY'S BOTTOM LINE. OR TOP LINE, HE WOULDN'T  KNOW, I'M NOT INTO THAT  LIFESTYLE. FOLKS, NEXT UP ON-- THE WAG  THING I AS THE KIDS CALL IT,  MI SUCH A STANCH SUPPORTER OF THE RIGHT TO BEAR FIREARMS  THAT I'M UP SET WE CAN'T  BEAR FIRE LEGS. THAT'S TOO LIMBS THAT AREN'T  SHOOTING SOMETHING. SO YOU KNOW I WAS PUMPED AS  A 12 GAUGE TO SEE THE  STUDENTS WITH GUN PERMITS  CAN GET THEIR OWN SEGREGATED DORMS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF  COLORADO. FOREVER INSURANCING THAT NO  ONE WILL THINK OF IT AS A  SAFETY SCHOOL. BUT FOLKS, I'M SORRY, I HAVE  TO GIVE A WAG OF MY FINGER  AT UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO STUDENTS BECAUSE NOT ONE  SIGNED UP TO LIVE IN THE GUN  DORM. COME ON. THIS IS COLLEGE. TIME TO GET CRAZY. DO SHOTS, TAKE SHOTS, GET  SHOT. MAYBE JOIN A FRATERNITY LIKE  I'M A POPPA CAPA. (APPLAUSE)  GOOD BUNCH OF GUYS. LET'S FACE IT, LIVING IN A  GUN DORM IS NOT ANY MORE  LIFE THREATENING THAN  SPENDING 160,000 DOLLARS ON AN ENGLISH DEGREE. SO COME ON, U OF C STUDENTS,  LIVE A LITTLE. IF NOT VERY LONG. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
