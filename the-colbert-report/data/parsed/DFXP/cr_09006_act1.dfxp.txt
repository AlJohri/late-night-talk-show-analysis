Stephen: TONIGHT, RUSSIA  TRIES TO CLAIM THE NORTH POLE! MR. GORBACHEV, TEAR DOWN THIS  NARWHAL! (LAUGHTER)  THEN MITT ROMNEY THREATENS IRAN. STOP YOUR NUCLEAR PROGRAM OR HE  WILL CUT OFF YOUR PBS! (LAUGHTER)  AND MY GUEST IS MUSIC LEGEND AND  ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST MORRISSEY  IN HIS HONOR, TODAY MY INTERNS ARE FREE RANGE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NASA'S "CURIOSITY" ROVER HAS  FOUND A SMALL SHINY OBJECT ON  MARS. IT'S EITHER THE TOP OF A GIANT  METAL CITY BURIED BENEATH THE  SAND OR A SCREW. (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  "REPORT," EVERYBODY, THANK YOU  SO MUCH FOR JOINING US! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU SO MUCH, PLEASE,  NATION --  (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  THANK YOU SO MUCH, PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU'RE TOO  KIND TO ME. NATION, IT HAS BEEN 16 MONTHS  SINCE MITT ROMNEY DECLARED HIS  CANDIDACY-- A MONTH SINCE HE  ACCEPTED THE NOMINATION AND FIVE DAYS SINCE HE STARTED RUNNING  FOR PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, HE IS SURGING! NEW POLLS HAVE HIM TIED WITH OR  LEADING THE PRESIDENT AND THE  "NEW YORK TIMES" 538 BLOG NOW  GIVES HIM A 28.6% CHANCE OF  WINNING! HE IS ON A ROCKET RIDE TO  PLAUSIBLE! (LAUGHTER)  AND, OF COURSE, IN THE FACE OF  THIS SURGE, OBAMA HAS BECOME  DESPERATE. YESTERDAY AT A CALIFORNIA FUND  FUND-RAISER HE WARNED THE  AUDIENCE WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE TO  WIN SAYING "WE'RE ONLY GOING TO DO IT IF EVERYBODY IS ALMOST  OBSESSIVE FOR THE NEXT 29 DAYS."  (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S RIGHT, OBAMA SUPPORTERS, RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ONLY LOGGED ON  TO HIS WEB SITE, FACEBOOK PAGE,  TWITTER FEED, YOUTUBE CHANNEL,  MOBILE APP, PINTEREST BOARD, TUMBLR, FLICKR, SPOTIFY, STORIFY  AND INS GRAM. HE NEEDS YOU TO COMMENCE! FOLKS, I'M WORRIED OBAMA'S  FOLLOWERS ARE OBSESSIVE ENOUGH  TO PULL THIS THING OFF. ACTUALLY, I THINK THEY'RE  OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE. HOW ELSE COULD HE HAVE RAISED  $181 MILLION IN DONATIONS LAST  MONTH-- 98% OF WHICH WERE UNDER  $250! CLEARLY HIS FOLLOWERS CLICK THE  "DONATE" BUTTON, TOUCH ALL THE  DOORKNOBS IN THEIR HOUSE, DONATE  AGAIN, THEN RECHECK THE DOORKNOBS BECAUSE LAST TIME THEY  MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED ONE OF THEM  IN THE WRONG SPOT. (LAUGHTER)  SO FOR THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH I  WANT TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE OBAMA  SUPPORTERS OUT THERE. GUYS, THE PRESIDENT'S COUNTING  ON YOU TO BE OBSESSIVE. SO ON NOVEMBER 6-YOU SHOULD  DEFINITELY GO VOTE AFTER, OF  COURSE, TURNING THE LIGHT SWITCH  ON AND OFF FIVE TIMES INSTEAD OF THREE, BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S  WHY HE LOST THE DEBATE. (LAUGHTER)  AND BEFORE YOU LEAVE FOR THE  POLL, MAKE SURE YOUR D.V.D.s ARE  NOT ONLY ALPHABETICAL AND FACING RIGHT BUT THE DISKS INSIDE HAVE  THEIR LABELS ORIENTED TO 12:00. (LAUGHTER)  OH, THEN GO TO THE CLOSET AND  MAKE SURE THE LACES ON ALL YOUR  ST. LOUIS THE EXACT SAME LENGTH. THEN GET OUT YOUR KEY SQUARE AND  ALIGN ALL THE TUPPERWARE IN YOUR  FRINGE AT PERFECT RIGHT ANGLES. THEN BACK TO THE SHOES BECAUSE I  THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE MISLACED  ONE OF THE EYE HOLES. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK THOSE  DOORKNOBS AGAIN. (LAUGHTER)  THEN GO VOTE FOR OBAMA. OH, AFTER YOU FOUND THE LOAF OF  BREAD THAT I'VE HIDDEN IN YOUR  HOUSE WITH THE HEEL TAKEN OUT,  REVERSED AND THEN PUT BACK IN TWO SPLICES IN, OKAY. (APPLAUSE)  WHAT'S THAT? WHAT? OH, YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR IT  SCREAMING. (LAUGHTER)  ANYWAY, ROP THE VOKE. FOLKS, THIS SUMMER WAS A  SCORCHER AND THE NATIONAL SNOW  AND ICE DATA CENTER RECENTLY  WARMED THAT ARCTIC SEA ICE IS AT A RECORD LOW SHRINKING FROM THIS  IN 1984 TO THIS TODAY. BUT CUT THE ICE SOME SLACK, OF  COURSE IT SHRANK! THAT WATER'S FREEZING! (LAUGHTER)  AND NOW THAT THE ICE HAS MELTED,  IT CAN MEAN ONLY ONE THING:  SUBZERO PLEASURE YACHTING. LAST MONTH, IN THE MUNICIPAL VUT  TERRITORY, CANADIAN POLICE FINED  AN AUSTRALIAN TYCOON FOR AN  ARCTIC PARTY CRUISE ABOARD HIS LUXURY YACHT "FORTRUS" WHERE HE  AND HIS FRIEND GOT DRUNK, SET  OFF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS, JETSKIED  AND HARASSED LOCAL MUSK-OX. (LAUGHTER)  DID YOU KNOW THE ESKIMOS NOW  HAVE 25 DIFFERENT WORDS FOR  "DOUCHEBAG"? (LAUGHTER)  BUT, IN ADDITION --  (APPLAUSE)  DOUCHEBAG. DOUCHEBAG FANS HERE TONIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BUT IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING  NOUVEAU PLACES TO BE RICHE, AS  THE ARCTIC ICE MELTS IT'S ALSO EXPOSING OIL, DIAMONDS, SHIPPING  ROUTES, AND THE NEW HISTORY  CHANNEL SERIES "ICE ROAD  DROWNERS."  (LAUGHTER) SO THAT MEANS IT'S TIME FOR  ANOTHER EDITION OF "SMOKING  POLES."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE QUEST FOR ARCTIC RICHES. FOLKS, AMERICA HAS MANY RIVALS  IN THE BATTLE FOR ARCTIC BOOTY:  RUSSIA, DENMARK, AND NOW CHINA  WHICH IS LOBBYING INTENSELY FOR PERMANENT OBSERVER STATUS ON THE  ARCTIC COUNCIL AS A NEAR-ARCTIC  STATE. BECAUSE MUCH LIKE THE PEOPLE IN  THE ARCTIC, THE CHINESE CAN'T  SEE FOR THE "SUN" FOR SIX MONTHS  A YEAR. (LAUGHTER)  PLUS, CHINA COVETS GREENLAND'S  RESOURCE RICH BOUNTIES.
UNDER THIS ICE SHEET LIES  VAST DEPOSITS OF VALUABLE  MINERALS. HERE IN SOUTH GREENLAND,  GEOLOGISTS HAVE FOUND SOME OF  THE WORLD'S LARGEST DEPOSITS OF  RARE EARTH METALS. THESE ARE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS IN  THE MANUFACTURE OF HIGH TECH  ITEMS.
Stephen: CHINA NEEDS THESE  RARE EARTH METALS TO MAKE CELL  PHONES, MILITARY GUIDANCE  SYSTEMS AND TOOTHPASTE. (LAUGHTER)  LUCKILY GREENLAND'S VICE PREMIER  JENS B. FREDERIKSEN SEES THROUGH  CHINA'S SUDDEN INTEREST IN THEIR COUNTRY SAYING "WE ARE AWARE  THAT IS BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE  SOMETHING TO OFFER, NOT BECAUSE  THEY SUDDENLY DISCOVERED THAT INUIT ARE NICE PEOPLE."  (LAUGHTER)  BRAVO, JENS, FOR NOT FALLING FOR  CHINA'S MOO GOO GAI PANDERING. CHINA DOESN'T APPRECIATE YOUR  PROTO-INUIT THULE CULTURE THE  WAY AMERICA TRULY DOES. THEY DON'T KNOW AN UMIAK FROM AN  ALEUT IQYAK. BUT AMERICA WILL RESPECT YOU FOR  YOUR PEOPLES. FOR YOUR CULTURE AND OF COURSE  FOR YOUR PRECIOUS LANTHANUM FOR  WHICH WE WILL HOLLOW OUT YOUR  COUNTRY LIKE A RIPE CANTALOUPE. (LAUGHTER)  NEXT UP, BACK IN 2007, VLADIMIR  PUTIN SENT A ROBOT SUBMERSIBLE  TO PLANT THE RUSSIAN FLAG ON THE SEA FLOOR. IT WAS THE SAFEST WAY TO CLAIM  THE NORTH POLE, BECAUSE WE ALL  KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LICK  IT. (SCREAMING)  (LAUGHTER)  TRUE STORY. BUT NOW THE RUSSIANS HAVE GONE  TOO FAR, SENDING A RUSSIAN  ORTHODOX BISHOP WHO LOWERED A  HOLY MEMORIAL CAPSULE INTO THE SEA, CONSECRATING THE NORTH POLE  TO THE RUSSIANS. IT WAS BAD ENOUGH WHEN THEY WERE  GODLESS COMMIES, FOLKS. BUT NOW THEY'RE GODLY COMMIES. (LAUGHTER)  SORRY, RUSKIES, EVERYBODY KNOWS  GOD GAVE NORTH POLE TO AMERICA  BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE SANTA  LIVES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND HE IS A SALARIED EMPLOYEE OF  THE COCA-COLA COMPANY! (LAUGHTER)  READ YOUR CONTRACT, CRINKLE. WE NEED THOSE COKE-DRINKING  POLAR BEARS TO DISAPPEAR AND WE  CAN DO THE SAME THING TO YOU,  CHRIS. FOLKS, WE MUST FIGHT THIS  RUSSIAN ORTHODOX RELIGIOUS  NATIONALISM WITH OUR OWN  AMERICAN ORTHODOX RELIGIOUS  NATIONALISM. I SAY WE SLAP A FUR HAT ON PAT  ROBERTSON AND PUSH HIM OUT ON AN  ICE FLOE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HE CAN CONSECRATE THE ARCTIC  CIRCLE FOR AMERICA! AND MAYBE FINALLY GET TO THE  BOTTOM OF WHAT'S CAUSING ALL  THAT ICE TO MELT. I'M GUESSING IT'S SOMETHING  REALLY HOT THAT THE GAYS ARE  DOING. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
