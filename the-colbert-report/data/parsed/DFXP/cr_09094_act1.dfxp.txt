CRISIS. MOVE AMERICA BELOW MEXICO SO  THEY ALL RUN INTO CANADA. PLUS INNOVATION IN BEER. GET READY FOR BUD LIGHT WITHOUT  LIME. AND MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE THE  MAKERS OF THE NEW PHOTO  MESSAGING APP SNAPCHAT. IT'S GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE  WAY I SEND MYSELF SELFIES. A NEW STUDY SAYS FISH USE SIGN  LANGUAGE. MAYBE NOW I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT  ALL THAT FLOPPING AROUND ON THE  BOTTOM OF MY BOAT MEANS. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME TO THE  REPORT.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. FOR ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA,  NATION, YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IF YOU  WATCH THE NEWS AS CLOSELY AS I DO, YOU KNOW THE SEQUESTER  BUDGET CUTS ARE HERE. THE UNEMPLOYED HAVE SEEN SMALLER  BENEFIT CHECKS, SOME CANCER  PATIENTS HAVE GONE WITHOUT TREATMENT, AND LINES AT NEW  YORK'S LAGUARDIA AIRPORT NOW  START AT CHICAGO'S O'HARE. TOUGH MEDICINE. BUT CONSERVATIVES LIKE ME KNOW  THAT IN A BUDGET CRISIS,  EVERYTHING NONESSENTIAL HAS TO GO -- WHETHER IT'S FOOD FOR KIDS  WHO AREN'T MINE OR SOME OTHER  STUFF FOR PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW. BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT  GOVERNMENT SPENDS MONEY ON THAT  ARE WORTH -- STAY WITH ME -- SPENDING MONEY -- STAY WITH  ME -- ON. AND, AS USUAL, THOSE THINGS ARE  TANKS. THEY ARE SO IMPORTANT THAT WE  NEED THEM EVEN WHEN WE DON'T  NEED THEM.
CONGRESS APPROPRIATED $255  MILLION TO UPGRADE THE ARMY'S M1  ABRAMS TANK BUT HERE'S THE  THING. THE PENTAGON WANTS TO HALT  PRODUCTION ON THESE TANKS.
MILITARY GENERALS SAY WE  DON'T NEED THAT TANK OR THAT  BOMBER. CONGRESS SAYS YEAH YOU DO.
LAWMAKERS FROM BOTH PARTIES  HAVE DEVOTED THE TAX PAYER MONEY  FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS ON IMPROVING THE ABRAMS TANK BUT  GENERAL RAY ODIERNO, THE ARMY'S  CHIEF OF STAFF, SAID IF HE HAD A CHOICE HE'D USE THE MONEY IN A  DIFFERENT WAY.
Stephen: I AM SHOCKED TO HEAR  THAT FROM GENERAL ODIERNO WHO I  BELIEVE IS PART TANK ON HIS FATHER'S SIDE. WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE  TANKS ARE GOING TO ROLL AND IT'S  ALL TANKS... (LAUGHING) -- TO... THANK YOU. AND ALL IT'S "TANKS" TO OHIO'S  SENATOR ROB PORTMAN AND  CONGRESSMAN JIM JORDAN. IT'S A BRAVE STANCE FOR THESE  FISCAL CONSERVATIVES. CONGRESSMAN JORDAN WHO  REPRESENTS LIMA OHIO WHERE THE  TANKS ARE MANUFACTURED DEFENDED THE COST SAYING, QUOTE, THE ONE  AREA WHERE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO  SPEND TAX PAYER MONEY IS IN DEFENSE OF THE COUNTRY. THE OTHER AREA, YOU KNOW, HIS  DISTRICT. AND IF THE ARMY DOESN'T REALLY  WANT THEM, THAT'S FINE. THESE TWO HAVE VOTED TO CUT  FUNDING TO ALL KINDS OF SERVICES  AND THE TANKS CAN HELP FILL THE  GAPS. FOR INSTANCE, MEALS ON WHEELS  GOT HIT BY THE SEQUESTER. LET'S REPLACE IT WITH BREADS ON  TREADS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I MEAN, ONE OF THESE TANKS CAN  BARRAGE THE ELDERLY WITH STICKY  BUNS FROM THREE MILES AWAY. AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY  FOR CANCER PATIENTS' MEDICINE  ANYMORE, BUT WE CAN OFFER THEM ONE LAST BAD-ASS DAY OF  ADVENTURE. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE SOCIAL  SERVICES. I MEAN IN THE MILITARY THE BLUE  ANGELS' BUDGET HAS BEEN SPLASHED  BUT IT WILL BE JUST AS EXCITING TO WATCH THE GRAY TANKLES. OH, THEY'RE MAKING ANOTHER  SQUARE. THE BEST PART IS WE WON'T HAVE  TO SHUT DOWN THE TANK PLANT IN  LIMA, OHIO. AND THAT WILL SAVE JOBS. WELL, TWO OF THEM.   ( APPLAUSE )   FOLKS, ONE REASON... ONE REASON  FOR OUR... HUGE, HUGE TANK FANS  HERE TONIGHT. OF COURSE, ONE REASON OUR  BUDGETARY CRISIS IS HERE IS THAT  OUR NATION IS BEING OVERWHELMED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM. OR TO USE THEIR NATIVE TONGUE, A  SABADO GIGANTE. AND IT'S COMPOUNDING ANOTHER  RAPIDLY GROWING PROBLEM:  SPIRALING HEALTH CARE COSTS. BECAUSE -- AND I DID NOT KNOW  THIS -- UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS GET  SICK JUST LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE. AND THEN WHEN THEY HAVE TO GO TO  THE HOSPITAL, WHO IS GOING TO  PAY FOR THAT? THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T. THE HOSPITAL CAN'T. AND IT'S HARD TO GO AROUND THE  CORNER FOR A LOTTERY TICKET WHEN  YOU HAVE A CATHETER IN. FORTUNATELY, AMERICA'S HOSPITALS  HAVE FOUND A WAY TO TAKE THE  BULL BY THE HAIF OWES. AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF  TONIGHT'S WORD: MEDICAL LEAVE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   NATION, WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH  CARE, I BELIEVE IN THE OLD SAYING, "A HOSPITAL IS NO PLACE  TO BE SICK."  ESPECIALLY, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE  AN UNDOCUMENTED WORKER IN IOWA.
IMAGINE GETTING INTO A CAR  CRASH IN RURAL IOWA AND WAKING  UP FROM A COMA IN COASTAL  MEXICO. IT HAPPENED TO JACINTO CRUZ AND  JOSE RODRIGUEZ-SOLDANA, TWO  UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS SERIOUSLY INJURED IN A WRECK. THE DES MOINES HOSPITAL SENT  THEM OFF ON A PRIVATE JET TO  THEIR HOMETOWN IN VERA CRUZ. IOWA METHODIST MEDICAL CENTER  EFFECTIVELY DEPORTED TWO  COMATOSE PATIENTS WITH NO GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT.
Stephen: WELL, DEPORTED IS  SUCH A HARSH WORD. THE HOSPITAL SIMPLY MOVED THEM  TO THE INTENSIVE "WE DON'T CARE"  UNIT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THIS PROCESS IS CALLED MEDICAL  REPATRIATION. AND IT'S THE PERFECT ANSWER. IT'S TOTALLY UNREGULATED. SO HOSPITALS AVOID ALL THE RED  TAPE USUALLY INVOLVED IN  SHIPPING THE UNCONSCIOUS. AND DON'T WORRY. THESE DEPORTATIONS ARE 100%  CONSENSUAL. YOU SEE, ACCORDING TO A PATIENTS  RIGHTS LAWYER, IN CASES WHERE  THE PATIENT IS UNCONSCIOUS OR CAN'T COMMUNICATE, RELATIVES ARE  TOLD THEIR LOVED ONE WANTS TO  RETURN. YES, THEY'RE UNCONSCIOUS BUT  DOCTORS HAVE WAYS OF KNOWING  THIS STUFF. NOW NATURALLY, MEDICAL  REPATRIATION HAS THE  BLEEDING-HEART LABOR LOVERS OUT  THERE SAYING THE PRACTICE VIOLATES U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL  LAWS AND UNFAIRLY TARGETS ONE OF  THE NATION'S MOST DEFENSELESS  POPULATIONS. UNFAIRLY TARGETS? I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD UNFAIRLY  TARGET ME WITH A FREE RIDE ON A  PRIVATE JET. I MEAN, THAT'S THE HIGH LIFE. IN FACT, THE NEXT TIME... CHEERS  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  IN FACT, THE NEXT TIME I HAVE A COUPLE OF WEEKS OFF I'M GOING TO  GO STRAIGHT TO THE EMERGENCY  ROOM, TELL THE ADMITTING NURSE THAT I'M AN ILLEGAL ALIEN WHO  WAS BORN IN THE PLAYA FIESTA  BEACH CLUB AND HOTEL IN PUERTA VALLARTA AND THEN BASH MY MYSELF  IN THE SKULL WITH A HAMMER. WHEN I WAKE UP, I'LL HAVE BED  SORES IN PARADISE. UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, NOT ALL  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE IN COMAS. NOW THERE'S AN OBVIOUS FIX FOR  THAT. BUT I'M NOT TELLING YOU TO GET  IN YOUR CAR AND MOW DOWN  EVERYONE YOU SUSPECT OF BEING ON TEAM SHAKIRA. AND WE CAN USE THIS CONCEPT OF  JUST SHIPPING OFF OUR HEALTH  CARE EXPENSES ON OTHER THINGS. FOR INSTANCE, THE THINGS WE'RE  ALREADY USING IT ON.
SHOCKING ALLEGATIONS INTO  PATIENT DUMPING. LAS VEGAS HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE  ACCUSED TONIGHT OF SHIPPING  PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS WITH A ONE-WAY TICKET ON GREYHOUND  BUSES TO LOS ANGELES, SAN  FRANCISCO AND OTHER CALIFORNIA  CITIES.
Stephen: HEY, WHAT HAPPENS IN  VEGAS, STAYS IN VEGAS. UNLESS WHAT HAPPENS IS  PSYCHOSIS. NOW, FOLKS, ONE PSYCHIATRIC  HOSPITAL, ONE HOSPITAL IS  ACCUSED OF SHIPPING MORE THAN 1500 PATIENTS ALL OVER THE  COUNTRY. BUT THEY'RE NOT JUST ABANDONING  THEM. AS ONE PATIENT SENT TO  SACRAMENTO EXPLAINED HE WAS  GIVEN A THREE-DAY SUPPLY OF  MEDICATION AND TOLD TO CALL 911 WHEN HE ARRIVED. WE COULD SAVE EVEN MORE MONEY IF  WE GAVE THEM A THREE-DAY SUPPLY  OF RAISINETS AND TOLD THEM TO CALL MOVIEFONE. OF COURSE, SOME CITIES MIGHT NOT  LIKE HAVING PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS  DUMPED ON THEIR DOORSTEP. EASY FIX: DON'T LET THEM OFF THE  BUS. WE'LL HAVE A NATIONWIDE ROTATING  CARAVAN OF BUSES FILLED WITH THE  MENTALLY ILL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  FOLKS, I THINK THIS "OUT OF  SIGHT OUT OF MIND" STRATEGY CAN SAVE MONEY ON ALL OUR SOCIAL  PROBLEMS. LET'S END POVERTY BY FLYING THE  POOR TO SUB SAHARAN AFRICA. OR WE COULD STRAP THE ELDERLY TO  ROCKETS AND SHOOT THEM INTO  SPACE. OR MAYBE WE COULD SEND THE  UNEMPLOYED SOME PLACE I'LL NEVER  COME BACK FROM. BECAUSE IN AMERICA WE DON'T TURN  A BLIND EYE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR  FELLOW MAN. SO WE NEED TO SEND THEM SOME  PLACE WHERE WE CAN'T SEE THEM AT  ALL. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
