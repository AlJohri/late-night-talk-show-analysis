(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: RIGHT THERE, COME ON. YOU AND YOU AND YOU.
STEVE EN, STEPHEN, STEPH EN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! DHEERS PLAUS.
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. IT IS OUT THERE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE, FOLKS, NATION, I WILL MAKE ONE THING PERFECTLY CLEAR ABOUT HOW I FEEL, ALL RIGHT. NATION, DO NOT GET ME WRONG, MICHELLE OBAMA IS A LOVELY LADY, FRIEND OF THE SHOW. BUT EVER SINCE SHE STARTED HER LET'S MOVE CAMPAIGN TO COMBAT CHILDHOOD OBESITY, SHE'S BEEN CRAMMING HER PRO-HEALTH AGENDA DOWN OUR THROATS, THROATS THAT SHOULD BE PACKED WITH CHILI CHEESE FRIES. (LAUGHTER) AS GOD INTENDED. WELL, THE NANNY-IN-CHIEF HAS GONE TOO FAR.
MICHELLE OBAMA HAS ENCOURAGED AMERICANS TO EAT BETTER AND GET MORE EXERCISE. NOW SHE WANTS PEOPLE TO DRIJ MORE WATER.
WATER IS THE BEST AND EASIEST CHOICE WE CAN MAKE TO FEEL ENERGIZED, FOCUSED, HEALTHY AND REFRESHED.
DRINK JUST ONE MORE CLASS OF WATER A DAY AND YOU CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE FOR YOUR HEALTH.
Stephen: ONE MORE CLASS OF WATER A DAY? BUT THEN I WOULD BE DRINKING ONE GLASS OF WATER A DAY. (LAUGHTER) DO YOU REALIZE THAT WATER IS THE SAME THING THEY PUT IN TOILETS? THINK, LIKE JUST LISTEN THE REASON BEHIND THIS.
THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL SAYS THAT MORE THAN 40% OF AMERICAN DOES NOT DRINK ENOUGH WATER DAILY. AND 7% OF AMERICANS DON'T DRINK ANY WATER.
Stephen: MAYBE SO, BUT THOSE 7% GET PLENTY OF HYDRATION FROM WATERMELON FLAVORED JOLLY RANCHERS. (LAUGHTER) WATT CERTIFICATE RIGHT IN THE NAME. EXCUSE ME, I DROPPED MY PEN I'M SO ANGRY. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, AND MAY I REMIND YOU THAT JESUS HATED WATER. (LAUGHTER) YES. THAT'S WHY HE TURNED IT INTO WINE. IN FACT, HE REFUSED TO EVEN GET INTO IT. AND FOLKS T IS TIME TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE FORCES OF BIG HYDRATION. SO TONIGHT I AM CALLING ON ALL AMERICANS TO JUST SAY H2-NO AND BOYCOTT WATER. DO TO THE DRINK IT AND DO NOT USE IT FOR ANYTHING. OKAY? IF YOU WANT SOME KOOL-AID, DO WHAT I DO AND JUST SNORT THE POWDER. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE IT'S NOT JUST MICHELLE, I'M ALSO NOT A HUGE FAN OF BARACK. FROM DAY ONE I HAVE VOWED TO STOP OBAMACARE OR DIE TRYING. AND KNOWING MY LUCK I'D ALMOST DIE AND THEN GET NURSED BACK TO LIFE BY OBAMACARE. AND FOLKS, I AM NOT ALONE IN MY CRUSADE. YESTERDAY THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP ANNOUNCED THEIR SIMPLE YET SIMPLE MINDED PLAN TO CRIPPLE ALL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE.
THE GROUNDWORK HAS BEEN SET FOR A MONUMENTAL SHOWDOWN ON CAPITOL HILL AND IT ALL COMES DOWN TO A VERY SIMPLE FORMULA, EITHER DEMOCRATS VOTE TO DEFUND THE TRAIN WRECK THAT IS OBAMACARE OR THEY WILL RISK SHUTTING DOWN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
THIS WEEK THE HOUSE WILL PASS A CR, THAT-- OBAMACARE.
CAN YOU SEE THE SMILE ON MY FACE. I'M SO HAPPY BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GETTING TO A CONSENSUS WITH THE REPUBLICANS. I THINK WE CAN TAKE A VICTORY LAP.
Stephen: YES, A VICTORY LAP BECAUSE OBAMACARE IS DEAD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WEATHER OR NOT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WEATHER OR NOT! WEATHER OR NOT! -- WHOOO!
MAYBE. BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL A VIEW WRINKLES TO IRON OUT BEFORE THIS BRAVE ACT OF EXTORTION TAKES EFFECT.
YOU KNOW THAT THESE THINGS PROBABLY WON'T PASS THE DEMOCRATICALLY CONTROLLED SENATE AND THE PRESIDENT WOULD VETO IT EVEN IF IT DID.
THEY'RE PUTTING SOMETHING IN THERE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A NONSTARTER. THIS IS LIKE SAYING WE CAN PASS A BUDGET IF YOU CAN PROVE THERE'S LIFE ON MARS.
Stephen: BUT IF THERE IS LIFE ON MARS AT LEAST IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BUY ITS OWN HEALTH CARE. AND FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO STOPPING OBAMA CARE THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE BECAUSE THE STOOL SAMPLE IS ABOUT TO HIT THE FAN.
TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY THE FIRST AMERICANS CAN START SIGNING UP FOR THE EXCHANGES UNDER OBAMACARE. IT'S THE FIRST OF OCTOBER.
Stephen: OBAMACARE IS COMING, FOLKS, RUN FOR YOUR LIVES, NO, WAIT, DON'T RUN FOR YOUR LIVES, THAT WILL MAKE YOU HEALTHIER AND THAT'S JUST WHAT HE WANTS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, WORSE, WORSE-- GOT TO REMEMBER THAT. AND FOLKS, WORSE THAN THE COSTS OR THE BUREAUCRATS ON THE DEATH PANELS, THE MOST DANGEROUS THING ABOUT OBAMACARE IS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT LIKE IT. (LAUGHTER) AS CONSERVATIVE WRITER BYRON YORK RECENTLY YORKED, THE WHITE HOUSE KNOWS THAT ONCE THOSE PAYMENTS BEGIN REPEAL OG BAMACARE WILL NO LONGER BE AN ABSTRACT QUESTION OF REMOVING LEGISLATION NOT YET IN EFFECT. INSTEAD IT WILL BE A VERY REAL MATTER OF TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM PEOPLE IT IS VERY, VERY HARD TO DO THAT.
YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING, GIVE A MAN A FISH, HE'LL EAT FOR A DAY. TRY TO TAKE THAT FISH AWAY AGAIN AND THAT GUY WILL [BLEEP] YOU UP WITH A HALIBUT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND FOLKS, THE KEY TO IMPLEMENTING THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN ARE THE SO-CALLED OBAMACARE NAVIGATORS. NOW WHAT DOES AN OBAMACARE NAVIGATOR DO? SO YOU'RE ASKING WITH WHAT DOES AN OBAMACARE NAVIGATOR DO?
Stephen: YES, I AM.
THEY HELP UNINSURED RESIDENTS SIGN UP FOR THE STATE'S EXPANDED INSURANCE PROGRAM.
Stephen: THANK YOU,ON. THEY HELP YOU LEARN ABOUT OBAMACARE. THAT'S WHY REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ARE RESTRICTING AND REGULATING HEALTH CARE NAVIGATORS IN 16 DATES. IN 16 STATES. THEY ARE WITHHOLDING INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC. AND NO ONE IS WORKING HARDER TO KEEP THEIR CITIZENS IN THE DARK THAN THE SUNSHINE STATE. JIM?
TENSION OVER HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE AFFORDABLE CARE AGO OR O BA RAR-- OBAMACARE APPEARS TO BE SURFACING AGAIN IN FLORIDA. THIS TIME IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SO-CALLED FAV GATORS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP PEOPLE WADE THROUGH THE SYSTEM TO SIGN FOR HEALTH COVERAGE. THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IS SAYING THAT THOSE NAVIGATORS CAN'T OPERATE INSIDE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT OFFICES.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PUT OUT A NOTICE SAYING NAVIGATOR ITS COULDN'T, QUOTE, CONDUCT ACTIVITIES ON THE GROUNDS OF THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT.
Stephen: YES, WE NEED TO KEEP THE HEALTH CARE NAVIGATORS AWAY FROM THE UNINSURED. BECAUSE SHOULDN'T THE SEARCH FOR HEALTH CARE REALLY BE MORE ABOUT THE JOURNEY? (LAUGHTER) BESIDES, BESIDES, FOLKS, JUST WHO ARE THESE NAVIGATORS? THEY COULD BE DANGEROUS. I MEAN JUST LISTEN FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL AND FRIEND'S MOM YOU HAD A CRUSH ON PAM BONDI.
THESE NAVIGATORS WILL HELP OUR CONSUMERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY MOST PERSONAL AND PRIVATE INFORMATION. TAX RETURN INFORMATION, SOCIAL SECURITY INFORMATION, AND OUR BIGGEST FEAR, OF COURSE, IS IDENTITY THEFT.
Stephen: YES, THESE NAVIGATOR KOS STEAL THE IDENTITY OF THE UNINSURED POOR. THAT COULD RUIN THEIR CREDIT RATING. THAT'S WHY FLORIDA IS PUTTING ANOTHER SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE POOR LEARNING ABOUT OBAMACARE. WHILE HEALTH CENTRES CAN ACCEPT BROCHURES AND OTHER OUTREACH MATERIAL ABOUT INSURANCE, THE MATERIALS WILL ONLY BE DISTRIBUTED IF SOMEONE ASKS FOR IT. THAT MAKES SENSE. YOU CAN ONLY ASK FOR THE MATERIAL THAT WILL INFORM YOU ABOUT THE PROGRAM IF YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM ENOUGH TO ASK FOR THE MATERIAL. THEN, THEN--  (APPLAUSE)
THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO FILL OUT THE MOBIUS FORM. HOPEFULLY, FOLKS, HOPEFULLY ONE OF THESE PLANS WILL KILO BAMACARE, IF NOT, I GUESS REPUBLICANS CAN JUST VOTE TO REPEAL IT AGAIN AND YES, I KNOW THEY'VE ALREADY TRIED THAT 41 TIMES, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY AGAIN. AND IF THAT FAILS, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY-- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. TRI, TRI, TRI, TRI, TRI, TRI, TRI,
