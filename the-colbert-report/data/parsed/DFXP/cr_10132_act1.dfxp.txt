Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS, IF YOU ARE WATCHING THE NEWS, AND I HOPE YOU ARE BECAUSE IT HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT TONIGHT, WE ARE ALL PAINFULLY AWARE OF THE ONGOING TRAGEDY ALONG OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. DESPITE OUR BEST INTENTIONS, IT REMAINS IMPOSSIBLE TO PAIR AN OUTFIT WITH TURQUOISE JEWELRY! (LAUGHTER) DON'T BELIEVE THE MAN AT THE KIOSK, YOU WILL LOOK LIKE AN EXTRA FROM DANCES WITH WOLVES (LAUGHTER) ANOTHER BIG ISSUE FROM DOWN THERE, THOUSANDS OF CENTRAL AMERICAN CHILDREN POURING OVER THE BORDER AND THE PRESIDENT IS DOING NOTHING TO STOP IT.  AND IT'S NO WONDER. ALL THAT JUMPING AND RUNNING ON TRAINS, I'M SURE IT'S PART OF THE FIRST LADY'S LET'S MOVE CAMPAIGN. FOR MONTHS NOW WE'VE BEEN SOLD A BILL OF GOODS THAT THESE KIDS ARE FLEEING PLACES BACK HOME LIKE SAN PEDRO SULA, HONDURAS,  KNOWN AS THE MURDER CAPITAL AROUND THE WORLD. THOUGH I AM DUBIOUS OF THAT TITLE. THEY'RE PROBABLY PADDING THE  NUMBERS BY LUMPING IN THE MURDER SUBURBS. SAN PEDRO SULA HEIGHTS FORTUNATELY, CONGRESS SENT A 7 MEMBER DELEGATION ON A FACT FINDING MISSION TO HONDURAS AND GUATEMALA. AND THE TRUTH COULD NOT BE MORE WHAT I WANT IT TO BE. ACCORDING TO REP. PEARCE, MOST IMMIGRANTS FROM CENTRAL AMERICA ACCORDING TO THE ARE DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC REASONS NOT FEAR OF PHYSICAL DANGER IN THEIR HOMELAND. THAT IS A WELCOME RELIEF. THESE KIDS AREN'T WORRIED ABOUT VIOLENCE, ONLY ABOUT STARVATION. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST PEARCE'S FINDINGS BECAUSE HE CULTIVATED AN INTIMATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE REGION DURING A VISIT TO GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND. (LAUGHTER) IT'S REALLY ALL YOU NEED. I LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE DESERT BY SPENDING A WEEKEND AT BURNING MAN. TURNS OUT THE DESERT IS FULL OF DRUGS AND IMPRACTICAL BICYCLES. AND CONGRESSMAN PEARCE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF DANGER ANYWHERE HE LOOKED, WHICH IT TURNS OUT WAS MAINLY AROUND THE HOTEL LOBBY, AS PEARCE SAID, HE AND THE REST OF THE HOUSE DELEGATION DID NOT VENTURE FROM THEIR HOTEL VERY OFTEN BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS. (APPLAUSE) THE POINT IS -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BOTTOM LINE, THESE IMMIGRANT CHILDREN ARE NOT REFUGEES, THEY'RE JUST PARASITES LOOKING FOR JOBS, AND IF I WERE THEM I WOULD TRY TO GET ONE AT THAT HOTEL BECAUSE APPARENTLY IT IS THE ONLY SAFE PLACE IN TOWN (LAUGHTER) NOW, NATION, IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME, YOU GET ALL YOUR NEWS FROM ME. I RECENTLY LEARNED A BOMBSHELL FROM MYSELF. I WAS CATCHING UP ON OLD EPISODES OF "THE DAILY SHOW" WHEN I CAME ACROSS SOMETHING THAT REALLY CAUGHT ME WITH MY PANTS DOWN -- AND, YES, THAT'S HOW I WATCH THE DAILY SHOW. (LAUGHTER) IT'S THAT GOOD. AND THIS SEGMENT BLEW MY PANTS BACK ON.
JON, THIS IS GOING TO COME AS SOMETHING OF A SHOCK TO YOU.
YOU'RE ENDING YOUR SHOW. JON, PLEASE. I'M ENDING MY SHOW. I HAVE TO, JON, DON'T BEG ME TO STAY.
ALL RIGHT. YOU SEE, THERE IS NO MOUNTAIN LEFT FOR ME TO CLIMB. IT'S BECOME CLEAR TO ME THAT I'VE WON TELEVISION. YES. (APPLAUSE) "THE COLBERT REPORT," THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MY FRIENDS. THANK YOU, NATION. YES, "THE COLBERT REPORT" IS COMING TO AN END. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen:, NO, NO, DON'T BE SAD. I'LL STILL BE GREAT. YOU JUST WON'T GET TO SEE IT ANYMORE. THE TIME IS RIGHT.  I WON TELEVISION JUST IN TIME FOR IT TO TURN INTO NETFLIX. I'VE DONE ALL I SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH, SPOKE TRUTH TO POWER, WON THE IRAQ WAR AND MET THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCANDINAVIAN HIP-HOP-SWING FUSION GROUP OF 2009. AND I HAVE BUT ONE REGRET -- BARACK OBAMA WILL OUTLAST ME IN OFFICE, WITH TWO YEARS OF NO COLBERT TO REIN THIS MAN IN! BY THE TIME HE LEAVES IN 2016, EVERYONE IN AMERICA WILL BE POT-SMOKING GAY IMMIGRANTS IN A POLYGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH A BIRACIAL BOX TURTLE! (LAUGHTER) THANKFULLY, THERE IS ONE LAST HOPE FOR STOPPING HIM.
CALLS FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA'S IMPEACHMENT ARE INCREASING.
PROMINENT OUTSIDE CONSERVATIVE VOICES HAVE CALLED FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO BE IMPEACHED.
IMPEACHMENT IS A MESSAGE THAT HAS TO BE SENT TO OUR PRESIDENT THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH THIS LAWLESSNESS.
Stephen: YOU CAN TRUST SARAH PALIN ON IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE SHE IS AN EXPERT OF LEAVING OFFICE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TERM (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I SAY IT IS TIME TO DO THIS THING! IMPEACHING IS WHAT REPUBLICANS DO BEST! LET'S MAKE BARACK OBAMA JUST AS UNPOPULAR AS BILL CLINTON! AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT ALL OF MY FELLOW CONSERVATIVES STAND WITH SARAH --
WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO GOVERNOR PALIN?
I DISAGREE. WHAT ABOUT THE FOLKS IN YOUR CONFERENCE ROOM CALLING FOR IMPEACHMENT?
I DISAGREE. THINK SARAH PALIN IS WRONG. LOOK, THIS ISN'T THE TIME FOR US TO GO INTO THAT EXERCISE.
WE ARE NOT WORKING ON OR DRAWING UP ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT.
I THINK IT'S A DISTRACTION THAT'S NOT SHARED BY MOST REPUBLICANS.
BUT I WANT TO IMPEACH HIM NOW! I'VE ALREADY SENT OUT OF MY FLYERS FOR MY IM-PIZZA PARTY! (APPLAUSE) BUT, FOLKS, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I HAVE GOT TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT. WE ALL HAVE GOT TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IMPEACHMENT IS A MONEYMAKER. LOOK AT FORMER CONGRESSMAN AND ACTOR PLAYING GREY-HAIRED MAN IN COMMUNITY THEATER ALLEN WEST. IN A RECENT EMAIL TO SUPPORTERS, WEST WROTE, TODAY SARAH PALIN JOINED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CONSERVATIVES WHEN SHE CALLED FOR IMPEACHMENT OF BARACK OBAMA. IN LIGHT OF THIS GROWING MOVEMENT, I'VE DECIDED TO OPEN THE GUARDIAN FUNDS IMPEACHMENT SURVEY FOR A LIMITED TIME. WILL YOU MAKE AN EMERGENCY CONTRIBUTION OF $5 OR MORE RIGHT AWAY SO WE CAN GET THIS SURVEY INTO THE HANDS OF AS MANY CONSERVATIVES AS POSSIBLE? THAT IS A MAN YOU CAN TRUST. HE'S GOT A VAGUE PLAN WHERE YOU DO ALL THE WORK AND PAY HIM $5. SIGN ME UP! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOR THE RECORD, ANYONE OUT THERE KEEPING SCORE, IT'S NOT JUST THE G.O.P. DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO USING IMPEACHMENT TALK TO GIN UP DONATIONS LIKE THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE WHO SENT TWO E-MAILS WITH SUBJECTS LIKE "BREAKING IMPEACHMENT" AND NETTED NEARLY 10,000 DONATIONS IN JUST 24 HOURS. WOW, TO MAKE THAT KIND OF MONEY THAT FAST YOU USUALLY HAVE TO GO ONTO KICKSTARTER AND SAY YOU WANT TO MAKE POTATO SALAD (LAUGHTER) SO WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH IMPEACHMENT, IT MIGHT BE A GOOD INVESTMENT. WE TURN TO MY GOOD FRIEND, AFRICAN-AMERICAN REPUBLICAN AND BLACK-TREPRENEUR, P.K. WINSOME! ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU P.K. WINSOME, EVERYBODY, COME ON! P.K., COME ON, GIVE IT TO ME, BROTHER, YEAH. ALL RIGHT. P.K. WINSOME, THANKS FOR BEING HERE, MY FRIEND.
ABSOLUTELY, STEPHEN.
Stephen: P.K., IT'S ALWAYS PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU IN THE HIZZOUSE.  THAT'S...THAT'S CORRECT.
Stephen: YOU ARE NOT ONLY A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN, I UNDERSTAND YOU TRAFFIC IN STOLEN KIDNEYS, SNAKE VENOM,  ELEPHANT IVORY SEX TOYS --
GUILTY AS CHARGED -- UNLESS I'M BEING CHARGED WITH ANY OF THOSE THINGS.
Stephen: P.K., LET'S GET TO THE HEAT OF THE MEAT. DO YOU BELIEVE WE SHOULD IMPEACH IMPEACH PRESIDENT OBAMA?
WELL STEPHEN THAT'S A VERY SERIOUS SUBJECT. WHICH IS WHY I'VE CREATED THIS SURVEY "IMPEACHMENT, A VERY SERIOUS SUBJECT?" FOR $5, I'LL SEND THIS SURVEY TO YOUR HOME SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW SERIOUS A PROBLEM IMPEACHMENT IS. Stephan: WHAT A GREAT CAUSE. WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? EVERY CENT GOES TO THE P.K. WINSOME ACTION SHIELD TRUST NETWORK WHICH USES THOSE $5 DONATIONS TO SEND OUT A  SECOND SURVEY ASKING FOR A $10 DONATION. I CAN'T WAIT.
Stephen: PEOPLE ARE EXCITED.
YEAH. THEY LOVE A GOOD DEAL.
Stephen: YEAH. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE RESULTS, STEPHEN.
Stephen: IMPORTANT WORK, P.K. HERE'S MY $5, I'M IN.
GREAT.
Stephen: P.K., I WANT TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. WHAT CAN I DO WITH YOUR HELP TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN?
MM-HMM, YEAH. WELL, STEPHEN, I HAVE A STEP-BY-STEP PLAN TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT OBAMA. IT'S ALL IN MY NEW BOOK -- LOOK OUT, OBAMA, YOU'RE BEING IMPEACHED!
Stephen: THAT'S A STRONG MESSAGE. BUT LET'S PRETEND I DON'T WANT TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. ANYTHING I CAN DO TO STOP IT?
YES! BUY MY BOOK, "LOOK OUT, OBAMA, YOU'RE BEING IMPEACHED!"
Stephen: SORRY FOR ASKING BUT IS THAT THE SAME BOOK?
GOOD EYE, STEPHEN. IT'S A CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE. ON EACH PAGE, YOU DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT OBAMA. SPOILER ALERT, NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU CHOOSE, HE IS EATEN BY A DRAGON.
Stephen: THANKS FOR ALL THE WORK. KEEP US UPDATED ON ALL THE FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES.
ACTUALLY, I DO HAVE ONE MORE OPPORTUNITY. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF OR PARTICIPANT IN HISTORY, YOU WILL NOT WANT TO MISS THIS EXCLUSIVE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN AN HONORARY DOCTORATE OF FINE ARTS FROM KNOX COLLEGE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS WAS ONCE BESTOWED ON TV'S STEPHEN COLBERT.
Stephen: P.K., THAT'S MY DOCTORATE. THAT'S FROM MY SET. (LAUGHTER)
ABSOLUTELY. AND WITH THE SHOW ENDING, IT'S A COLLECTOR'S ITEM -- FOR JUST $5,000. ACT NOW AND I'LL ALSO THROW IN THIS 2013 EMMY FOR THE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) -- IT'S FOR "THE COLBERT REPORT YOU KNOW, STEPHEN, THIS WILL LOOK GREAT ON YOUR SHELF.
Stephen: I CAN GET BOTH FOR $5,000?
FOR A LIMITED TIME.
Stephen: IT'S A DEAL, MY FRIEND. (LAUGHTER) P.K. WINSOME, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
