WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,  MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS LEAD  ANCHOR OF MSNBC ELECTION NIGHT COVERAGE. THEY WERE THE FIRST TO CALL  THE RACE FOR OBAMA BACK IN  JANUARY. PLEASE WELCOME RACHEL MADDOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  RACHEL, GOOD TO SEE YOU  AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT. YOUNG LADY.
YES, HELLO.
Stephen: FEELING GOOD? FEELING GOOD OVER THERE.
I LOVE ELECTION SEASON  EVERY YEAR NO MATTER WHAT  HAPPENS.
Stephen: HAVE YOU GOTTEN  ANY SLEEP?
YOU KNOW HOW THE  NIGHT-- NO, I HAVEN'T. BUT YOU KNOW, YOU STAY UP  ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY  ARE YOU SORT OF FINE BUT  THEN THE DAY AFTER THAT YOUR BRAIN TURNS TO PUDDING. I HAVE PUDDING BRAIN TODAY. I CAN'T THINK. I'M VERY TIRED.
Stephen: I DON'T EVEN  UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU JUST  SAID.
SEE. THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
Stephen: NOW ARE THE HOST,  YOU WERE THE HOST OF THE  RACHEL MADDOUT BROADCAST EVERY-- NIGHT OF THE WEEK. YOU'RE ALSO AUTHOR OF THE  BOOK DRIFT, ALL RIGHT, ITS  UNMOORING OF THE AMERICAN  MILITARY. ENOUGH OF THAT. ALL RIGHT. STILL ME WHAT IT WAS LIKE  ELECTION NIGHT OVER AT  MSNBC. OKAY WHEN YOU GUYS KNEW THAT  OBAMA WAS GOING TO WIN. WAS IT JUST CRAZY OVER  THERE? WAS CHRIS MATTHEWS LIKE  RUNNING AROUND WITH A LAMP  SHADE ON HIS HEAD OR DO THEY MAKE LAMP SHADES BIG ENOUGH  TO FIT ON HIS HEAD?
WE WERE ALL COVERING IT. AND WHEN OHIO WENT, WE WERE  NOT EXPECTING IT. IT WAS SORT OF, WE WERE IN  THE MIDDLE OF TALKING ABOUT  FORECALL FOR ANOTHER STATION, AN WHEN THEY SAID THAT OHIO  HAPPENED IT WAS SORT OF LIKE  DO-WHOOP? IT HAPPENED QUICKLY AND WE  WERE ALL INVOLVED IN  COVERING, AND WANTED TO MAKE  SURE WE HAD THE RIGHT  INFORMATION. IT WAS A WORK DAY.
Stephen: HERE IS THE  THING. THE PEOPLE AT FOX SEEMED  MORE FREAKED OUT THAN YOU  GUYS SEEMED ELATED. WHY WAS IT? COULD YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT  THINGS WERE TURNING YOUR  WAY? WHY WEREN'T YOU DOING THE  END ZONE DANCE.
I THINK THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES IS  THAT THE RIGHT TALKED  THEMSELVES INTO THE IDEA THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A  ROMNEY LANDSLIDE BASED ON I  DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: GUT.
GUT, FEELINGS.
Stephen: OUR BUDDY SKOW  JAR OWE-- SCAR BORROW SAYS  CUT SAYS ROMNEY.
KARL ROVE IS SAYING YES,  I SEE THE POLLS BUT I ALSO  SEE THESE ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS AND BASED ON THE  ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS I'M SURE  ROMNEY IS GOING TO WIN. TURNED OUT TO BE A BAD WAY  TO PREDICT THE ELECTION. WE WERE LOOKING AT THE  POLLS.
Stephen: COSTILL PULL IT  OUT THERE IS ANOTHER PATH TO  27020 MITT. NEVER SAY DIE ON THIS ONE. HE JUST NEEDS TO GET  SWITZERLAND, THE CAYMAN  ISLANDS AND THE SECRET STATE  ONLY REPUBLICANS CAN SEE WHITESYLVANIA, HE'LL GET  THERE, HE'LL GET THERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HE'S NOT GOING TO GET  THERE. IT IS REALLY OVER.
Stephen: LET ME TELL YOU,  HERE'S WHAT I, OBVIOUSLY  WE'RE ON THE DIFFERENCE SIDE OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM  HERE. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOUR SHOW. WHAT I RESPECT IS YOU  DECONSTRUCT THE NEWS AND I  PUT THE DAY'S NEWS LIKE  PARTS ON A LAWN, LIKE OF A  CAR. AND THEN YOU GO ALL THE  PARTS OF THE ENGINE THAT IS  ROARING THROUGH THE NEWS  RIGHT NOW. BUT THEN YOU RECONSTRUCT  THOSE PIECES INTO A  CONSERVATIVE DREAM KILLING  MACHINE.
I DON'T WANT-- I DON'T  WANT TO KILL ANYBODY'S DREAM  BUT I-- BUT I DO FEEL LIKE THERE'S AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO  PLAY IN DISABUSING PEOPLE OF  THEIR FANTASIES THAT DO NOT COMPORT WITH WHAT IS GOING  ON IN THE REAL WORLD.
Stephen: LAST NIGHT DID  YOU DO AN END ZONE DANCE. DID YOU A NINE MINUTE LOOK  AT WHAT THE DEMOCRATS WON  LAST NIGHT. IS THAT WHAT THE NEXT FOUR  YEARS ARE GOING TO BE? NO OLIVE BRANCH OR IF IT  ISN'T AN OLIVE BRANCH IT IS  A STICK IN THE EYE OF GUYS LIKE ME?
I WASN'T TRYING TO DO AN  END ZONE DANCE. I WAS DESCRIBING WHAT  HAPPENED.
Stephen: AND YOU SAID YOU  MIGHT WANT TO GO GET SOME  POPCORN OR SOMETHING LIKE  THAT.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: SO I'M CALLING [BLEEP] ON YOUR FRIENDLINESS. (APPLAUSE)  THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DAYS  WHEN THE FACTS HAVE A  LIBERAL BIAS. AND IF YOU DESCRIBE WHAT  HAPPENS IN LAST NIGHT-- IN  THIS WEEK'S ELECTION,  LIBERALS ARE GOING TO BE HAPPY BY A FACTUAL  DESCRIPTION OF WHAT  HAPPENED. AND SO JUST DOING NO  ADJECTIVES DESCRIBING THE  OUTCOME AT THE STATE LEVEL,  IN THE SENATE, ESPECIALLY AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL, JUST  RAW DATA MAKES PEOPLE LIKE  SEND YOU FLOWERS. AND THAT IS, THAT'S WHAT IS  GOING ON IN THE WORLD RIGHT  NOW. AND DENYING WHAT IT IS  HAPPENING WHICH I THINK IS  WHAT THE RIGHT TRIED TO DO  THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN WHEN ROMNEY WAS LOSING DOESN'T  HELP.
Stephen: IT WAS HURRICANE  SANDY THAT DID IT, IT WAS  HURRICANE SANDY THAT DID IT. PEOPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT  THE NOR'EASTER THAT CAME THE  DAY AFTER THE ELECTION THAT DID IT.
BUT ITS IF THE RIGHT IS  GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT JUST  HAPPENED AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, BUT FOR THE STORM, WE  DID EVERYTHING RIGHT AND THE  COUNTRY LOVES US, DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY  WITH ALL THE NEXT ELECTIONS  TOO.
Stephen: AND LISTEN, YOU  KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSES  HURRICANES. GAY PEOPLE CAUSE HURRICANES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THAT'S SCIENCE OR DON'T YOU  BELIEVE IN SCIENCE ANY MORE? (LAUGHTER)
DO GAY PEOPLE LOWER  BAROMETRIC PRESSURE.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, YES,  THEY DO. (LAUGHTER)  RACHEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME.
SURE.
Stephen: RACHEL MAD OU,  THE BOOK IS-- SORRY WE  DIDN'T GET TO IT WE'LL BE
