Stephen: BECAUSE PEOPLE  LOOK AT YOU. THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE  I SAID YOU RELAX ME ON-SITE. BUT IS THAT REAL? ARE YOU-- OR IS THERE  LIKE-- A TWISTED FIRE INSIDE  OF YOU.
NO, WELL, NOT TWISTED  FIRE. THERE'S SORT OF A LOW GRADE  ANXIETY, FEAR, IRRITATION  GOING ON ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU --
