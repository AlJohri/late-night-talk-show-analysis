WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT HELPED FOUND THE MEDICAL CHARITY, PARTNERS IN HEALTH.  THEY USED TO BE ROOMMATES IN HEALTH,  BUT THEIR FAMILIES ALWAYS KNEW PLEASE WELCOME DR. PAUL FARMER. HEY, DR. FARMER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE,  DR. PAUL FARMER. YOU ARE THE CO-FOUNDER OF PARTNERS IN HEALTH, A NONPROFIT THAT PROVIDES HEALTH CARE TO THE POOR ALL OVER THE WORLD. STARTED IN THE 1980s IN HAITI. THE GROUP IS NOW COMBATING AIDS IN RWANDA, TUBERCULOSIS IN PERU, EBOLA IN WEST AFRICA AND-- YOU HAVE BEEN IN WEST AFRICA RECENTLY?
YES. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I'M GOING  TO WANT TO YOU TAKE YOUR TEMPERATURE-- THERE, JUST AT SOME POINT BEFORE YOU LEAVE, JUST GET THAT IN YOUR BUTT.
OKAY, I DO-- .
Stephen: I DO IT TO ALL MY GUESTS, NOT JUST YOU. AGAIN, MY APOLOGIES TO DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN
NOW OKAY, WHY DO YOU PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO THE POOR ALL AROUND THE WORLD? WHY DO THAT? SELL ME ON HELPING PEOPLE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY GRATIFYING WORK. IT'S VERY SATISFYING. FIRST OF ALL-- .
Stephen: A LOT OF COIN IN THAT? A LOT OF MONEY IN THAT?
WELL THERE ARE OTHER REWARDS. WELL, YOU HAVE THE REWARD OF SEEING-- SEEING HOW EFFECTIVE MEDICINE CAN BE IN PUBLIC HEALTH.
Stephen: OKAY.
AND YOU GET TO USE YOUR COIN METAPHOR, YOU GET MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK, ACTUALLY, WHEN YOU TURN YOUR ATTENTION TO PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES ARE DAMAGED BY POVERTY, AND ILLNESS BECAUSE YOU WILL SEE THEY WILL RESPOND WELL TO INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE EASILY AVAILABLE TO US. IT'S VERY SATISFYING.
Stephen: YOU ALSO HAVE A BOOK CALLED INFECTIONS AND INEQUALITIES. WHAT DO YOU MEAN ABOUT INFECTIONS AND INEQUALITIES. INFECTIONS I UNDERSTAND. THAT'S MEDICINE STUFF. BUT INEQUALITY, INEQUALITY SOUNDS LIKE POLITICS. THAT SOUNDS-- INEQUALITY SOUNDS LIKE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY, SOCIALISM, HOW ARE THEY RELATED TO EACH OTHER?
WELL, I AM REFERRING TO ECONOMIC INEQUALITY.
Stephen:  IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MEDICINE
IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH MEDICINE.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, YOU CAN'T GET SICK FROM BEING POOR.
YOU KNOW, SOCIAL DISPARITIES RANGING FROM RACISM DEGENERATIVE QUALITIES DO MAKE PEOPLE SICK. THEY MAKE PEOPLE SICK DIRECTLY. BUT THEY PROBABLY MAKE OUR SOCIETY SICK AS WELL.
Stephen: IS BEING POOR CONTAGIOUS?
WELL, IN A SENSE IT IS CONTAGIOUS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU DO STUDIES OF OBESITY IN AN AMERICAN CITY, AND YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE IS A SOCIAL SPREAD OF CERTAINLY-- I AM RELUCTANT TO CALL THEM POOR HABITS BECAUSE PEOPLE END UP LIVING IN PLACES THAT IT DON'T HAVE GOOD AND HEALTHY FOOD. OR DON'T HAVE SAFE ENVIRONMENTS. SO IN THAT SENSE, IT IS CONTAGIOUS.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE PRESCRIPTION FOR POVERTY?
WELL, THE PRESCRIPTION FOR POVERTY INCLUDES TRANSFER OF RESOURCES. LIKE YOU KNOW, ONE OF THEIR MOST SUCCESSFUL AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT IS-- I MEAN IT'S CAUSED BY A HOKEY NAME. A CASH TRANSFER, CONDITIONAL OR-- .
Stephen: THAT'S NOT A HOKEY NAME, THAT IS A TERRIFYING NAME. BECAUSE I'VE GOT A LOT OF CASH AND YOU WANT MY CASH TO GO TO SOMEBODY ELSE?
WELL, AGAIN, YOU'LL HAVE A BIG RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT. BECAUSE IF YOU-- .
Stephen: I GOT A BIG RETURN ON IT RIGHT NOW, MY FRIEND. CALLED WALL STREET.
WELL, COMPARED TO SOME OTHER INVESTMENT ON WALL STREET OR OFF OF IT, INVESTING RESOURCES IN REALLY POOR FAMILIES, IN POOR COMMUNITIES, LEADS TO PRETTY RAPID IMPROVEMENT. AND I THINK THERE'S THE IDEA-- .
Stephen: HOW DOES THAT HELP ME. I GIVE MONEY-- I GIVE MY MONEY, IT GOES TO SOME POOR GUY, YOU KNOW, WHERE, WHERE ARE YOU GUYS WORKING? GIVE ME A PLACE.
LIBERIA, SIERRA LEONE.
Stephen: SO MY MONEY GOES OVER THERE, HOW IS THAT HELPING ME? HOW IS THAT SCRATCHING MY BACK?
THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE WORLD WILL BE SAFER AND MORE PROSPEROUS IF THERE ARE NOT THESE KIND OF INEQUALITIES, IF WE CAN ADDRESS THEM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE PARTNERS IN HEALTH HELPED WORLDWIDE SO FAR.
CUMULATIVELY?
Stephen: YEAH.
MANY, MANY MILLIONS, I IMAGINE. EVEN TENS OF MILLIONS AND WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES, FOR EXAMPLE, IN RWANDA. TO USE THAT EXAMPLE WE'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO REACH, YOU KNOW, SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF THE POPULATION. AND SEE MASSIVE REVERSALS IN MISFORTUNE THAT RWANDA KNEW ONLY 15 YEARS AGO SO RWANDA, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A COUNTRY WITH A PRETTY GOOD HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. AND ALTHOUGH YOU COULDN'T-- YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A HEART TRANSPLANT THERE OR HAVE, YOU KNOW, CHOOSE TO HAVE YOUR MALIGNANCY TREATED THERE, IF YOU ARE SICK AND ARE IN A VILLAGE, YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT SYSTEM REACHING YOU. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY REDUCTION IN EARLY MORTALITY HAS BEEN MORE STEEPED IN RWANDA THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HOW LONG  HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS WORK?
30 PLUS YEARS.
Stephen: AND DO YOU GO YOURSELF TO SOME OF THESE PLACES AROUND THE WORLD?
I DO.
Stephen: ROUGH PLACES, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACES YOU'VE BEEN? IS.
WELL, I'VE BEEN IN VERY-- PLACES THAT ARE UNSTABLE. AND SO-- .
Stephen: THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES?
I WAS THERE YESTERDAY.
Stephen: WERE YOU REALLY?
YEAH
Stephen: YOU GOT OUT ALIVE.
I DID. AND THEY DIDN'T GET EBOLA. SO-- I WAS THERE YESTERDAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DO YOU EVER-- OKAY, I UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND LIKE YOU KNOW CARING FOR PEOPLE AND I, THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF WORK I WOULD DO, BUT NEEDLES MAKE ME... ALSO POOR PEOPLE, BUT DO YOU, DO YOU HAVE LIKE EVER EMPATHY OVERLOAD AND DO YOU EVER SAY TO YOURSELF "IF I VACCINATE ONE MORE KID TODAY," DO YOU EVER GET TIRED OF THIS. YOU WANT TO PACK IT IN? WHY ISN'T THERE A HEALTH CRISIS IN ST. BARTS?
WELL, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY, I MEAN, I THINK ONE DOES GET TAXED. AND YOU DO REACH THE LIMITS. THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP AND WITH A TEAM. BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE ON YOUR TEAM WHO IS NOT TIRED OR OVERWORKED, YOU KNOW, IF IT'S A BIG ENOUGH TEAM THAT IS THE OTHER GREAT THING ABOUT TEACHING IS YOU BRING IN VITAL PEOPLE EVERY YEAR INTO THIS WORK SO IT IS A GREAT WAY TO AVOID BURNOUT.
HOW IS THE ORGANIZATION SUSTAINED?
A LOT OF PARTNERS IN HEALTH SUPPORT COMES FROM PRIVATE DONORS, INDIVIDUALS, MOST OF IT IN FACT
Stephen: IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO DONATE PARTNERS IN HEALTH, WHERE WOULD THEY GO?
WWW.PIH.ORG.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE-- THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE-- THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT'S ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW. DR. PAUL FARMER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: DR. PAUL FARMER, PARTNERS IN HEALTH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
