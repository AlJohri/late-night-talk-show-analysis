[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT AS A BOOK AND A  DOCUMENTARY CALLED "DIRTY WARS."  ABOUT AMERICA'S COVERT MILITARY  OPERATIONS. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE THE LAST  PERSON TO SEE HIM ALIVE. PLEASE WELCOME JEREMY SCAHILL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOOD TO SEE YOU, SIR. ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU ARE NATIONAL  SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FOR THE  NATION MAGAZINE. YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF "DIRTY  WARS" THE WORLD IS A  BATTLEFIELD. YOU ARE ALSO COWRITER AND  PRODUCER OF "DIRTY WARS" THE  MOVIE WHICH BLEW UP AT SUN DANCE THIS YEAR. OKAY. YOU SAY WE'RE IN SOME DECLARED  SOME UNDECLARED WARS AND THAT  SOMEHOW IS A BAD THING. OKAY. THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE,  SIR. YOU KNOW THAT.
IF WHAT WE WERE DOING WAS  KILLING LEGITIMATE TERRORISTS.
Stephen: WHICH WE ARE. NO QUESTION. Stephen: THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US. OKAY.
A LOT OF THE ACTIONS THOUGH  THAT ARE TAKING PLACE AROUND THE  WORLD PARTICULARLY IN THE UNDECLARED WARS BUT ALSO IN A  SECRET WAR WITHIN AFGHANISTAN AS  CONCEALED BY THE BIGGER WAR, WE'RE DOING NIGHT RAIDS, WE'RE  KILLING A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF  INNOCENT CIVILIANS.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT THAT.
I WAS ON THE GROUND IN YEMEN,  AFGHANISTAN AND SOMALIA AND I  WENT TO VILLAGES WHERE ONE OF THE FIRST STRIKES PRESIDENT  OBAMA AUTHORIZED IN YEMEN KILLED  46 PEOPLE. 14 WOMEN AND 21 CHILDREN. WHO WAS THE TARGET IN THAT  ACCIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE HAS  NOT PROVIDED ANY INFORMATION. WE SAY IF YOU'RE A MILITARY AGE  MALE IN A CERTAIN REGION OF THIS  COUNTRY WE'RE GOING TO KILL YOU AND LATER SAY YOU WERE A  TERRORIST WITHOUT EVER PROVIDING  ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY INVOLVED.
THEY HAD INFORMATION ON THESE  PEOPLE. THEY JUST CAN'T TELL US.
THAT'S NOT TRUE. Stephen: HOW DO YOU KNOW  THAT? THEY'RE TELLING US THAT THEY  HAVE IT. WAIT. THEY SAY THAT THEY HAVE IT. BUT THEM CAN'T TELL US BECAUSE  THEN THE ENEMY WILL KNOW THE  MEANS BY WHICH THEY GOT THAT  INFORMATION.
SO YOU HAVE AN UNDYING FAITH  IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S  ABILITY TO TELL THE TRUTH ON THESE ISSUES?
Stephen: NO, NO. I BELIEVE IN OUR TROOPS.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT A TROOPS. Stephen: IT IS IS ABOUT THE  TROOPS.
THIS IS ABOUT ANALYSTS  SITTING IN TRAILER IN THE  SOUTHWEST OF THE UNITED STATES OPERATING DRONES THAT ARE  BOMBING PAKISTAN AND YEMEN.
Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING THAT  AN UNMANNED DRONE IS NOT A  TROOP? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
THEY TRIED TO MAKE A MEDAL  FOR DRONE PILOTS AND IT WAS  RESCINDED BY THE DEFENSE  SECRETARY. THE TROOPS DISAGREE WITH YOUR  POSITION THAT A DRONE IS A  TROOF.
Stephen: I GUESS I SUPPORT  MORE OF THE TROOPS THAN THE DRONES  DO. OKAY. WAIT A SECOND HERE. SO WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER? WE FIND OUT THAT THERE IS  SOMEBODY IN YEMEN WE THINK IS  DOING... PLANNING SOMETHING NASTY FOR US. POSSIBLE HOSTILE INTENT. WHAT DO WE DO AGAIN? WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO? LET'S HEAR IT.
FIRST OF ALL WE CAN INDICT  THEM AND DEMAND THEIR  EXTRADITION.
Stephen: LIKE A COURT. THAT USED TO BE HOW WE DID  IT.
Stephen: THEY'RE PLANNING  OVER THERE.
OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS INDICTED. Stephen: WITH A BULLET IN HIS  EYE. THAT'S HOW HE WAS INDICTED. CAN WE DO THAT? ARE YOU OKAY WITH THE BIN LADEN  THING.
THE STANDARD SHOULD BE IF  SOMEONE IS POSING AN IMMINENT  THREAT.
Stephen: THEY ARE! CAPTURE IS NOT FEASIBLE. WHAT YOU'RE DEFENDING, STEPHEN,  IS THIS GROTESQUE FORM OF  PRE-CRIME THAT YOU REPRESENT AN IMMINENT THREAT TO THE NATIONAL  SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen: LET'S ROLE PLAY. A GUY NAMED, LET'S CALL IT  ABDUL. HE'S IN YEMEN. HE'S NOT FROM THERE. WE'VE SEEN HIM MEET WITH  SOMEBODY BEFORE. HE'S SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT THE  UNITED STATES. HE'S ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO  ATTACK US EVEN IF HE'S NOT  COMING HIMSELF. WHAT'S... WE INDICT HIM AND THEN  WHAT HAPPENS?
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE SAYING THAT SOMEONE IS  SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT THE  UNITED STATES. HE WAS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
Stephen: WAS. NOW HE'S A VAPOR TRIAL.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SEARCHED AS  JUDGE, JURY AND EXECUTIONER.
Stephen: YOU LEFT OUT  COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
HE'S ALSO THE COMMANDER IN  CHIEF. IF YOU FAST FORWARD TO THE DEATH  PENALTY WITHOUT AN INDICTMENT. IF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN IS GOING  TO BE EXECUTED ON ORDERS OF A  PRESIDENT THE GOVERNMENT HAS A BURDEN TO SHOW EVIDENCE AGAINST  HIM.
Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW THAT  HE'S NOT A THREAT. THEY SAY HE'S AN I AM NET  THREAT.
ONLY BY EDICT. Stephen: HOWEVER YOU SAY IT,  I DON'T CARE WHAT LANGUAGE YOU  SAY IT IN, YOU JUST SAY IT.
IT DOESN'T TROUBLE YOU THAT  THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES IS ASSERTING THE RIGHT TO KILL AMERICAN CITIZENS WITHOUT  ANY ACTUAL EVIDENCE FOR  INDICTING THEM AT ALL.
Stephen: I'M NOT ON THE LIST. HOW DO YOU KNOW. I MEAN, I WATCH THIS SHOW. YOU COULD BE ON THE LIST.
Stephen: IS IT HARD TO GET ON  THE LIST?
THAT'S PART OF THE THING. THEY MEET EVERY TUESDAY IN THESE  TERROR TUESDAY MEETINGS.
Stephen: REALLY TERROR  TUESDAY? DO THEY SERVE TALK OWES? YOU GET ON THE LIST AND THEN CAN  YOU GET OFF THE LIST.
ONLY FROM A DRONE STRIKE IT  SEEMS.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR JOINING ME. I HAVE TO CATCH A CAB. JEREMY SCAHILL. THE BOOK IS "DIRTY W
