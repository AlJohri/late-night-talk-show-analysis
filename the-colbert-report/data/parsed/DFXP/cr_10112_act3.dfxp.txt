UM... IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU INVOKE THE ALMIGHTY. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE IF YOU REMEMBER YOUR HISTORY, HE CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
ALL THINGS.
Stephen: YES. SO IT'S OKAY FOR ME TO HOST A SCIENCE SHOW. ACTUALLY --
Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING GOD IS SO POWERFUL HE CAN CREATE A SHOW SO GOOD EVEN HE WILL WATCH HIMSELF DISPROVE HIS OWN EXISTENCE?
SEE WHAT I MEAN ABOUT YOUR BRILLIANCE? EXACTLY.
Stephen: HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN SCIENCE?
NO, NO, I -- HOW MANY ACTORS DO YOU KNOW HAVE THE BRAIN POWER TO DEAL WITH SCIENCE?
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE, ACTORS ARE DUMB. VERY SHALLOW, YOU CANNOT GET YOUR ANKLES WET IN ACTORS.
I THINK SCIENTISTS ARE ALL LEFT-BRAINED PRIMARILY, ACTORS ARE ALL RIGHT-BRAINED. AREN'T YOU RIGHT-BRAINED?
Stephen: I DON'T HAVE ANY BRAIN.
Stephen: I'M ALL HEART, I'M ALL GUT, OKAY? RIGHT FROM HERE, OKAY? SECONDARY ORGAN. (LAUGHTER)
WE LOVE YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LOVE YOU, TOO. NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON A GOOD FRIEND OF THE SHOW HAS A SCIENCE SHOW CALLED COSMOS, GOING TO BE UP AGAINST YOU GUYS IN A FIGHT.
WE HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS. REMEMBER THAT, NEIL. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH NOW, WE HAVE A LITTLE CLIP OF THE SHOW. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
SHAMEFUL BEHAVIOR IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. MOST OF THE SUPER RICH WOULD ARGUE THEY'RE NOT BREAKING ANY SOCIAL RULES. IN FACT, THEIR INVESTMENTS CREATE JOBS AND MAKE THE ENTIRE ECONOMY THRIVE AND GROW. BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLE AT ANY INCOME LEVEL WHO ARE WILLING TO CHEAT TO MAKE A PROFIT. WHEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE CALLED OUT BY NAME IN FRONT OF A CROWD, SHAME CAN BE EFFECTIVE.
OKAY, IS THAT AN ATTACK ON RICH PEOPLE? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, YOU ARE A RICH MAN.
NO, IT IS NOT AN ATTACK ON RICH PEOPLE.
Stephen: OKAY. BUT IT IS -- LET'S CALL IT AN EXAMINATION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LEVELING THE FIELD A LITTLE BIT MORE.
Stephen: THE EPISODE IS EVERY SHOW STARTS WITH A QUESTION. THIS ONE IS POVERTY GENETIC? WHO WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION? I MEAN, YOU WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION.
I WOULD ASK IT, YEAH.
Stephen: IS IT GENETIC? NO, CAN'T POSSIBLY BE.
Stephen: THAT'S A VERY SHORT SHOW.
IT'S A VERY SHORT SHOW. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXAMINING THE IDEA OF GENETICS INVOLVED WITH WEALTH.
Stephen: AS A STAR OF STAGE AND SCREEN --
AND RADIO.
Stephen: -- AND RADIO, IS THERE A FIELD YOU HAVEN'T CONQUERED YET THAT YOU'D LIKE TO?
NO...
Stephen: NO? NO... I THINK I'M PRETTY COMPLETE BY NOW.
Stephen: YOU'RE COMPLETE? YEAH (LAUGHTER) I'M ALMOST AT THE APEX OF LIFE.
Stephen: HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
AWESOME!
Stephen: I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THERE! (APPLAUSE) MORGAN FREEMAN, "THROUGH THE WORMHOLE" ON THE SCIENCE CHANNEL! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
