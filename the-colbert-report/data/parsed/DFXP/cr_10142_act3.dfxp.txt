(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE C.E.O. OF THE ROOM SHARING SERVICE AIRBNB. EVERY B&B I STAYED IN HAD AIR. PLEASE WELCOME BRIAN CHESKY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, BRIAN! THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE THE CO-FOUNDER AND C.E.O. OF AIRBNB, A $10 BILLION HOSPITALITY, HOSPITALITY EXCHANGE COMPANY. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AIRBNB AND JUST HOME PROSTITUTION? BECAUSE YOU'RE SELLING YOUR HOUSE THERE. SOME OF THESE HOUSES ARE LITERALLY ON STREET CORNERS.
WELL, THE WHOLE IDEA IS WE HAVE THIS IDEA, WHAT IF YOU COULD FEEL LIKE YOU'RE HOME ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. AND WHAT WE WANTED TO DO IS TAKE THE STRANGERS OUT OF IT. SO...
Stephen: WELL, I HAVE HOMES ALL OVER THE WORLD. I CAN ALREADY DO THAT.
SO, THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CAN SEE WHO YOU'RE BOOKING WITH, YOU GET TO VIRTUALLY MEET THEM BEFORE AND WITH THE CLICK OF A BUTTON YOU CAN LITERALLY HAVE A CASTLE IN IRELAND, A BOAT OFF THE COAST OF CAPE TOWN OR ONE OF 34,000 HOMES IN PARIS.
Stephen: HOW DO I KNOW THAT THE PERSON I'M STAYING WITH IS NOT GOING TO KILL ME AND WEAR MY SKIN? (LAUGHTER)
SO THE WHOLE IDEA WAS THAT THERE ARE NO STRANGERS HERE. YOU GET TO VIRTUALLY MEET PEOPLE, SO YOU SEE THEIR PROFILE...
Stephen: YEAH.
AND THE WHOLE THING WORKS OFF OF REPUTATION OF TRUST. SO, YOU GET TO READ THE REVIEWS OF PEOPLE WHO STAYED WITH THESE PEOPLE BEFORE THIS HOST. AND YOU CAN READ THE REVIEWS. AND YOU CAN VIRTUALLY MEET THEM, YOU CAN MESSAGE THEM WHEN YOU'RE COMFORTABLE. AND YOU JUST BOOK.
Stephen: WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO DO THIS?
WELL, I WAS ACTUALLY, I MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH MY ROOMMATE JOE GEBBIA AND WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO PAY RENT. THERE WAS A DESIGN CONFERENCE COMING TO SAN FRANCISCO, ALL THE HOTELS WERE SOLD OUT. SO WE HAD THIS IDEA, LET'S JUST TURN OUR HOUSE INTO A BED AND BREAKFAST FOR THE CONFERENCE. BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BEDS. JOE HAD THREE AIR -- WE'D JUST MOVED UP THERE.  AND I WAS TOTALLY BROKE AT THIS POINT. JOE PULLED THREE AIR BEDS OUT OF THE CLOSET, HE INFLATES THEM AND WE REALIZE IT'S NOT A BED AND BREAKFAST. IT'S AN AIR BED AND BREAKFAST.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED AIR B & B! OK!
YES. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: NOW THIS IS SOMETIMES CALLED THE NEW SHARING ECONOMY.
RIGHT.
Stephen: I MISSED THE DAY IN KINDERGARTEN WHERE THEY TAUGHT US ABOUT SHARING.
YEAH.
Stephen: I DON'T LIKE IT. ALL RIGHT?
OKAY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WHAT? YOU'VE, WE'VE GOT UBER, YOU'VE GOT TASK RABBIT, YOU'VE GOT YOU GUYS...
AND YOU'VE GOT...
Stephen: EVENTUALLY, WILL EVERYONE, YOU KNOW, BELOW THE 1% JUST BE HELPING EACH OTHER? WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS TAKING OFF?
I THINK THIS IS TAKING OFF BECAUSE WITH THE, WHAT THE SHARING KIND OF REALLY MEANS IS NOW PEOPLE IN 60 SECONDS CAN BECOME MICROENTREPRENEURS. YOU CAN ADD A REPUTATION.  IF YOU HAVE A SKILL, AN ASSET YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIFE. YOU CAN SHARE IT WITH SOMEBODY AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ECONOMIC CLASS YOU'RE A PART OF. I THINK WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS, I THINK, IS THAT PEOPLE NOW HAVE THE POWER TO BECOME ENTREPRENEURS.
Stephen: OK, WHO DOESN'T LIKE YOU BECAUSE OF THIS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOTTEN SOME HEAT FROM VARIOUS CITIES AND FROM HOTEL CHAINS ABOUT THIS, HAVEN'T YOU?
I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE RESISTANT...
Stephen: HAVE YOU OR HAVE YOU NOT?
WE HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT OF RESISTENCE.
Stephen: GOT A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT?
GOT AN LITTLE BIT OF HEAT, YES.
Stephen: OK. ALL RIGHT, SO WHY?
YES. I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE WAY THINGS ARE. I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT BEING SAID, YOU KNOW, WE LAUNCHED DURING THE ECONOMIC CRISIS OF 2008 AND THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEEDED THIS CHANGE TO HAPPEN AND I THINK IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY A GOOD THING FOR THE WORLD. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BUT YOU GUYS ARE COMPETING, YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS ARE COMPETING WITH THESE HUGE HOTEL CHAINS, AND I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS: SHOULD PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS CORPORATIONS? (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, AIRBNB IS A CORPORATION AND WE STARTED -- I WAS THE FIRST HOST WITH JOE ON AIRBNB. I BELIEVE THAT, YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ECONOMY LIKE A CORPORATION AND BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR.
Stephen: DO YOU STILL USE IT?
I STILL USE IT. I'M STILL A HOST AND I'M STAYING HERE TONIGHT IN NEW YORK ACTUALLY ACROSS FROM YOU IN THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.
Stephen: OH REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE AIRBNB?
I HAVE NOT HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE. WELL ACTUALLY...
Stephen: AS THE C.E.O., IF YOU HAD SAID YES,  I WOULD HAVE FIRED YOU.
I DID STAY WITH A WOMAN WHO HAD A PARROT AND THAT WAS A LITTLE AWKWARD. BUT...
Stephen: ONE, ONE OF MY WRITERS WHO RECENTLY JOINED US AT THE SHOW, SHE STAYED AT AN AIRBNB FOR ABOUT A MONTH
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND WHEN SHE LEFT, THE HOST GAVE HER A WIDE SCREEN TV AND TWO NAKED MANNEQUINS. IS THAT STANDARD PROTOCOL?
WELL, I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT, LIKE, A LITTLE BIT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET, AND I THINK THAT LIKE MANY PEOPLE BECOME FRIENDS AFTER AND THERE'S THIS WONDERFUL CULTURAL EXCHANGE. YOU KNOW, JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, TONIGHT AROUND THE WORLD 375,000 PEOPLE ARE STAYING TOGETHER AND LIVING TOGETHER IN 160 COUNTRIES.
Stephen: WOW! (APPLAUSE) WHAT'S YOUR TASTE OF THAT? WHAT'S YOUR TASTE, WHAT'S YOUR PERCENTAGE ON THAT?
WE TAKE 13% OFF EVERY BOOKING.
Stephen: WOW!
AND THEN THE WORLD CUP, 600,000 PEOPLE WENT TO BRAZIL FOR THE WORLD CUP.
Stephen: YEAH.
ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE, 120,000, WERE ALSO STAYING IN AIRBNB.
Stephen: WOW. WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE FAVELA.
YES. EXACTLY.
Stephen: HERE'S YOUR BROKEN BOTTLE.
YES. EXACTLY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: IS THERE ANY PLACE YOU AREN'T YET THAT YOU WANT TO BE?
WELL, WE'RE IN EVERY COUNTRY BUT NORTH KOREA, IRAN, SYRIA AND CUBA. SO WE'RE...
Stephen: NORTH KOREA. WAIT, WAIT. NORTH KOREA...
IRAN...
IRAN.
SYRIA AND CUBA.
Stephen: AND CUBA. OK.
WE'RE NOT IN THOSE FOUR COUNTRIES. EMBARGOOS, AND ALSO, OBVIOUSLY, NORTH KOREA DOESN'T HAVE INTERNET ACCESS.
Stephen: NO. OR LIGHT.
YES. EXACTLY.
Stephen: WELL, WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. BRIAN CHESKY, CO-FOUNDER OF AIRBNB. CHECK IT OUT! CHECK IT OUT! WE'LL BE BACK!
