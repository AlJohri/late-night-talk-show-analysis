Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. NATION, IF YOU'RE A LONGTIME VIEWER OF THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW THAT BILL O'REILLY AND I HAVE A MUTUAL APPRECIATION SOCIETY. I ADMIRE BILL, AND SO DOES HE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND PAPA BEAR HAS BEEN ON A HOT STREAK LATELY. LAST WEEK I PRAISED HIM FOR TAKING ON THE FAR LEFT'S OBSESSION WITH EQUALITY. THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF BILL'S UNIFIED THEORY OF WHY EVERYTHING IS GOING TO HELL.
THE GRIEVANCE INDUSTRY BASICALLY SAYS AMERICA IS NOT A FAIR NATION, THAT THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST MINORITY, WOMEN, THE POOR, GAYS, ATHEISTS, MUSLIMS-- YOU NAME IT.  AND  THE BAD GUYS ARE WHITE MALES, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T BUY INTO THE GRIEVANCE INDUSTRY.
Stephen:  NOW, YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD OF THE GRIEVANCE INDUSTRY, BUT THEY ARE HUGE. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY'RE THE ONES WHO MANUFACTURE THE NATION'S COMPLAINT BOXES, THOSE PEEING CALVINS, AND YAHOO! COMMENTS. SO JUST WHEN DID THE GRIEVANCE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX BEGIN?
BACK IN THE LATE 1960s, THE VIETNAM WAR CAUSED A HUGE DIVISION IN AMERICA. MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE DECIDED THEIR COUNTRY WAS WRONG FOR FIGHTING THE WAR IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, SO THEY LAUNCHED MASSIVE DEMONSTRATIONS ALL ACROSS THE U.S.A., AND BUILT UP A CULTURE BUILT ON ANTIAUTHORITY-- THAT IS, THE MAN WHO HAD POWER WAS BAD. TO GO ALONG WITH THE POLITICAL STRIFE, THE YOUTH CULTURE EMBRACED SEX, DRUGS, AND ROCK 'N' ROLL, CHANGE THE COUNTRY FROM TRADITIONAL ATTITUDES TO "IF IT FEELS GOOD, DO IT."
Stephen:  YEAH, MAN, LET'S DEFY AUTHORITY AND NOT GO TO VIETNAM. BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD NOT TO DIE IN A RICE PADDY. FAR OUT, DADDYIO, KEEP ON TRUCKING. SOCK IT TO ME. GET A JOB. CUT YOUR HAIR! YOU SEE, BILL AND I KNOW IT WAS CRUCIAL TO FIGHT THAT WAR. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO AMERICA IF WE HADN'T GONE TO WAR IN VIETNAM? THAT MEANS NO FORREST GUMP, AND, THEREFORE, NO BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP SHACK MAC AND CHEESE, AND I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S NOT AN AMERICA I WANT TO LIVE IN. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS THIS CULTURE OF GRIEVANCE LIVES ON TODAY. I MEAN, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GRIEVANCE, LOOK NO FURTHER THAN BILL'S LATEST.
RECENTLY, COLBERT MOCKED ME ON THE SUBJECT OF INEQUALITY. ONLY ABOUT 1 MILLION PEOPLE WATCH HIS LATE-NIGHT PROGRAM AT 11:30 BUT HE IS THE DARLING OF THE FAR LEFT INTERNET WHEN RHAPSODIZES OVER HIM.
Stephen:  BILL'S RIGHT-- ( BOOING ).
Stephen:  I KNOW, FOLKS I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT BUT FOR SOME REASON THE FAR LEFT INTERNET LOVES ME. I'M IN ALL THE HASH TAGS. FOLKS, IF I THOUGHT--
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEVEEB! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  YOU KNOW YOU PEOPLE ARE THE BLOOD IN MY VEINS, RIGHT? FOLKS, IF I THOUGHT-- IF I THOUGHT FOR EVEN ONE SECOND SOMETHING I SAID HURT PAPA BEAR'S FEELINGS, I, TOO, AM HURT, AND TO BE HONEST, A LITTLE TURNED ON. ( LAUGHTER ) NOT THAT BILL WOULD BELIEVE ME.
AH, BUT MR. COLBERT IS A DECEIVER. I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY, AND ALSO BELIEVE INSTITUTIONAL BIAS SHOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW. WHAT I OPPOSE IS GOVERNMENT TRYING TO IMPOSE EQUALITY BECAUSE EVERY HUMAN BEING IS DIFFERENT.
Stephen:  BILL, YOU'VE GOT ME ALL WRONG. I AGREE WITH EVERY SINGLE WORD YOU'RE SAYING, EVEN IF THOSE WORDS  DON'T AGREE WITH EACH OTHER ( LAUGHTER ) YOU SEE, I ALSO BELIEVE INSTITUTIONAL BIAS SHOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW, AND AT THE SAME TIME, BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENTS SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THAT LEAVES, AH-- MAYBE A VOLUNTARY MAKE AI LAW, TAKE AI LAW TRAY, OR ROAMING GANGS OF VIGILANTE CANNIBAL EQUALITY BIKERS. OR WE COULD  GIVE BILL O'REILLY A HAT AND BADGE AND LET HIM WANDER THE LAND TELLING PINHEADS TO KNOCK IT OFF, BING, BING, BING.
BING, BING, BING. BING, BING, BING. BING, BING, BING. BING, BING, BING. BING, BING, BING.
Stephen:  I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER MYSELF.
