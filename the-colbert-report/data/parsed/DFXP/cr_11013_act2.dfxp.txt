(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH! NATION, WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENDING AMERICA, THERE IS NOBODY I TRUST MORE THAN TEXAS CONGRESSMAN AND CONFUSED PIECE OF GNOCCHI, LOUIE GOHMERT. BECAUSE HE'S BRAVE ENOUGH TO SAY THE THINGS THAT NO ONE HAS THE SLIGHTEST DESIRE TO SAY.
THANK YOU, PRESIDENT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA. HE HAS HELPED JUMP START A NEW OTTOMAN EMPIRE. WE ARE GOING TO BORROW MORE MONEY FROM THE CHINESE TO POSSIBLY GIVE THEM MONEY BACK TO CREATE HABITATS FOR WILD DOGS AND CATS THAT ARE RARE. THERE'S NO ASSURANCE THAT IF WE DID THAT, WE WOULDN'T END UP WITH MOO GOO DOG PAN OR MOO GOO CAT PAN. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THIS GOOD MAN IS ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT FOOD SAFETY, EVER SINCE HE DRANK THAT PAINT THINNER. IT'S ONLY TWO LETTERS AWAY FROM PAINT DINNER. AND RECENTLY, LOUIE MADE WORDS WITH HIS MOUTH AGAIN. THIS TIME, TO EXPLAIN ONCE AND FOR ALL THE DANGERS OF GAYS IN THE MILITARY.
I'VE HAD PEOPLE SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH GAYS IN THE MILITARY. LOOK AT THE GREEKS. WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY DID HAVE PEOPLE COME ALONG WHO THEY LOVED THAT WAS THE SAME SEX AND WOULD GIVE THEM MASSAGES BEFORE THEY WENT INTO BATTLE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF FIGHTING. IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR. AND IF YOU'RE SITTING AROUND GETTING MASSAGES ALL DAY, READY TO GO INTO A BIG, PLANNED BATTLE, THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LAST VERY LONG. IT'S GUERILLA FIGHTING. YOU ARE GOING TO BE ULTIMATELY VULNERABLE TO TERRORISM AND, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU START DOING IN THE MILITARY LIKE THE GREEKS DID... AS PEOPLE HAVE SAID, LOUIE, YOU HAVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR HISTORY. OH, YES, I DO. I KNOW EXACTLY. IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YES, GOHMERT KNOWS HIS HISTORY. OR HE MAY HAVE JUST BEEN WATCHING THE GAY VERSION OF THE FILM 300. (LAUGHTER) BY WHICH I MEAN THE ONE RELEASED IN THEATERS. (LAUGHTER)
AND THE GREEKS WERE THE GAYEST ARMY IN HISTORY. IT'S WHY THEY WERE ALWAYS TRAIPSING OFF FOR FABULOUS MEDITERRANEAN WARS. AND WHY THEY FOUGHT PACKED TOGETHER IN A PHALANX, AKA THE MAN-ON-MAN MASSAGE CUBE. (LAUGHTER) BUT LIKE GOHMERT  SAID, THAT WAS FINE FOR ANCIENT GREECE, BACK WHEN BATTLES HAD A SET TIME AND DATE. IT WAS EASY -- YOU'D GET A RUB-DOWN, THEN RUN OUT TO A PELOPONNESIAN FIELD FOR YOUR 2:00 P.M. FACE-SPEARING. (LAUGHTER) BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK IN TODAY'S AMERICA'S MILITARY. GAY MASSAGES HAVE NO PLACE IN OUR NEVER-ENDING GUERILLA WAR. I.S.I.S. ISN'T GONNA POSTPONE ITS AMBUSH SO YOU CAN FINISH LISTENING TO YOUR FAVORITE PERUVIAN PAN FLUTE CD. (LAUGHTER) AND WE ARE IN GRAVE DANGER, BECAUSE THE HOMOSEXUAL SEAWEED-WRAP LIFESTYLE HAS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE MILITARY. LOOK AT THE AIR FORCE. WHY DO YOU EVEN NEED A BACK SEAT IN A FIGHTER JET? THE CO-PILOT'S JUST BACK THERE FOR THE NECK RUBS! (LAUGHTER) NO WONDER TOM CRUISE WAS SO TENSE AFTER GOOSE DIED. AND WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CALLED HIM GOOSE? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WE MISS YOU ANTHONY EDWARDS! SO I STAND WITH LOUIE WHEN HE SAID THIS --
AS PEOPLE SAID, LOUIE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR HISTORY. I SAID, OH, YES, I DO. IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
Stephen: I'M WITH YOU, SIR. PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO ME, STEPHEN, YOU HAVE GOTTA UNDERSTAND, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR HISTORY. YOU'RE DUMB, DENSE, A MENTAL MIDGET WITH THE I.Q. OF A BUTTER DISH WHOSE MIND IS A BLACK HOLE THAT SUCKS ALL SURROUNDING THOUGHT INTO AN INFINITE SINGULARITY OF PURE STUPIDITY. I'M SURPRISED YOU CAN EVEN DRESS YOURSELF. I BET YOU HAVE TO RUB PEANUT BUTTER INSIDE YOUR LIPS TO REMEMBER TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND BREATHE. I'VE NEVER MET, AND HOPE TO NEVER MEET AGAIN, A MAN SO PERVASIVELY, ASTOUNDINGLY, UNYIELDINGLY IGNORANT. TO WHICH I SAY, WELL, YOU HAVEN'T MET LOUIE GOHMERT. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
