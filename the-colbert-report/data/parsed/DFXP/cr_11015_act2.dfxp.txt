Stephen:  WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIT DOWN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS JOB IS I'M LEARNING SOMETHING NEW ALL THE TIME. FOR INSTANCE I JUST FOUND OUT CANADA HAS ITS OWN GOVERNMENT. [LAUGHTER] EVEN MORE SHOCKING, IT IS NOT LED BY WAYNE GRETZKY. SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE I GUESS. LAST WEEK IN OTTAWA A LONE GUN MAN OPENED FIRE ON PARLIAMENT HILL, KILLING A SOLDIER THEN CONTINUING HIS SHOOTING SPREE INSIDE THE BUILDING. A SHOCKING ATTACK AND ALL AMERICANS SHARE  IN OUR NEIGHBORS GRIEF OVER THE SENSELESS TRAGEDY. BUT AS HORRIFIC AS THIS INCIDENT WAS, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN WORSE IF IT HADN'T BEEN STOPPED BY THE HOUSE OF COMMONS SERGEANT-AT-ARMS KEVIN VICKERS SEEN HERE WITH HIS CEREMONIAL GIANT BABY RATTLE. [LAUGHTER] HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
AFTER EXCHANGING GUNSHOTS WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY SECURITY TEAM AT THE ENTRANCE OF CENTER BLOCK THAT'S RIGHT HERE, HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE END OF THE HALL OF HONOR BESIDE THE LIBRARY THESE DOORS TO THE RIGHT IS A SMALL ALCOVE PROTECTED BY THIS PILLAR AND HE TUCKS HIMSELF IN THERE AND HIDES. KEVIN VICKERS OFFICE IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. HE HEARS THE GUNSHOT. HE GRABS A HIS SIDEARM, AN AUTOMATIC PISTOL. HE EXITS HIS OFFICE AND HE IMMEDIATELY RUNS TOWARDS THE PILLAR HERE. BIBEAU IS ON THE OTHER SIDE. THEY'RE LITERALLY AT ARM'S LENGTH JUST AROUND THE PILLAR. THE SERGEANT OF ARMS COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE BARREL OF THE GUN STICKING OUT FROM BEHIND THE PILLAR. HE DOESN'T HESITATE. KEVIN VICKERS TAKES HIS SIDE ARM AND DIVES AROUND THE PILLAR TO THE GROUND. WHILE HE'S IN THE AIR HE SPINS, TO LAND ON HIS BACK, FIRING UP, HITTING BIBEAU AS HE HITS THE GROUND. TO HELL WITH BRUCE WILLIS. THIS GUY, OUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH JUST PUT THE EH IN YIPPY-KAY-EH, MOTHER (BLEEP) THE VERY NEXT DAY. LISTEN TO THIS, THE VERY NEXT DAY VICKERS RETURNED TO WORK AND PARLIAMENT TORE THE ROOF OFF. [APPLAUSE]  [APPLAUSE]  LOOK AT THAT MAGNIFICENT BASTARD. STOIC. HUMBLE. FOLKS, I HAVE NOT BEEN THIS MOVED BY SOMETHING CANADIAN  SINCE THE RETURN OF DEGRASSI. I CANNOT BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS BUT I WAS WRONG ABOUT CANADA. I'VE SAID SOME AWFUL THINGS ABOUT YOU OVER THE YEARS I SAID YOU'RE NOTHING BUT MAPLE SUCKING MOOSE HUMPERS I'VE SAID YOU WERE A BUNCH OF BEAVER STROKING ICE HOLES. BUT NOW I KNOW THAT YOU ARE STEELY-EYED SNOWBALLED JOHN WU DIVING (BLEEP) KICKERS WHO NOT ONLY TAKE OUT THE TRASH, BUT ALSO THE RECYCLING SO TONIGHT I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING, I'M GOING TO DO THE MOST CANADIAN THING I CAN IMAGINE AND SAY I AM SORRY. NO, NO, NO. I'M MORE THAN THAT. I'M SORE-Y. WHICH I KNOW IN YOUR LANGUAGE MEANS BOTH HELLO AND GOOD-BYE. [LAUGHTER] AND TO MAKE AMENDS TO ALL RESIDENT OF CANADIA FOR EVERYTHING I EVER SAID I WILL NOW SING YOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM. [CROWD CHEERING] PLEASE RISE FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S NATIONAL ANTHEM. OH CANADA, OUR HOME AND NATIVE LAND. TRUE PATRIOT LOVE, IN ALL THY SON'S COMMAND, OH CANADA. AND THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT. THANK YOU CANADA.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
