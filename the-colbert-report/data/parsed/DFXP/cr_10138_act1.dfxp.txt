Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! (AUDIENCE CHANTS "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. FOLKS,-- WHAT A LOVELY MOB. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS, YOU KNOW-- IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS SHOW, IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS SHOW FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, AND I HOPE YOU HAVE BEEN, IT'S NO SECRET THAT BARACK OBAMA IS RUINING OUR ECONOMY. ASK YOURSELF-- ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION. UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP ARE YOU AS RICH AS YOU'D LIKE TO BE? I KNOW I COULD IMAGINE ME HAVING MORE MONEY. (LAUGHTER) I JUST DID.  WELL, JUST LISTEN TO THE LATEST MONETARY POLICY THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING FROM HIS SO-CALLED ECONOMIC ADVISORS.
LAST WEEK A YOUNG GIRL WROTE TO ASK ME WHY AREN'T THERE ANY WOMEN ON OUR CURRENCY. AND THEN SHE GAVE ME LIKE A LONG LIST OF POSSIBLE WOMEN TO PUT ON OUR DOLLAR BILLS AND QUARTERS AND STUFF. WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.
Stephen: A PRETTY GOOD IDEA? A PRETTY GOOD IDEA? JUST LOOK AT OUR MONEY. IT TOOK OVER 200 YEARS FOR OUR CURRENCY TO ACHIEVE THE PERFECT BALANCE OF DEAD WHITE GUYS AND SECRET ILLUMINATI SYMBOLS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PLEASE ACCEPT MY APPLICATION. AND THINK OF THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES HERE. IF WE PUT A WOMAN ON THE $1 BILL,  IT WILL BE WORTH ONLY 77 CENTS. PLUS THINK ABOUT THIS. I MEAN JUST FROM A MORAL, JUST FROM A MORAL POINT OF VIEW IF MY WALLET IS FILLED WITH LADIES, I CAN'T KEEP IT NEXT TO MY BUTT, I'M A MARRIED MAN. AND WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU AND YOUR BROS ARE HAVING A GUYS' NIGHT OUT? IF THERE IS A FEMALE FACE ON THE MONEY TUCKING IT INTO A G STRING MIGHT SOMEHOW FEEL DEMEANING TO WOMEN. AND SURE RIGHT NOW THERE AREN'T ANY WOMEN ON OUR CASH BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PORTRAITS OF WOMEN IN OTHER IMPORTANT PLACES. BATHROOM SIGNS, MUD FLAPS, SYRUP BOTTLES. AND IF WOMEN GET ON PAPER MONEY I DEMAND A MR. BUTTERWORTH. WHERE DOES OBAMA EXPECT TO FIT ALL THESE WOMEN. IS HE GOING TO MAKE NEW BILLS? WHAT DENOMINATION WILL IT BE. 3, 7, SHOE? MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA FAILS TO REALIZE HERE IS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE CURRENCY WITH A WOMAN ON IT. THE $2 BILL. IT'S NOT USED MUCH, I KNOW, BUT IT PROUDLY HONORS OUR FOUNDING MOTHER, MRS. DOUBTFIRE. NATION, I'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED THAT STARTING TOMORROW ISRAEL AND HAMAS WILL BEGIN A 72 HOUR HUMANITARIAN CEASE-FIRE. THOUGH THEY HAVE AGREED IN HOUR 73 TO RESUME THEIR INHUMANITY. THIS CONFLICT IN ISRAEL HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR, WHAT IS TODAY, JULY 31st, 3,000 YEARS. (LAUGHTER) AND WE'VE ALL BEEN HEARTBROKEN BY THE HORRORS OF THIS WAR. BUT NOW THERE HAVE BEEN DISTURBING REPORTS OF DAMAGE TO ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, ONE DIRECTION, WHO ARE ACCORDING TO CREDIBLE REPORTS, DIVIDED OVER GAZA. THAT'S RIGHT. ONE DIRECTION--  (LAUGHTER) ONE DIRECTION--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW HAS TWO DIRECTIONS. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN THIS MAKES ME QUESTION A LOT OF MY PREVIOUS ASSUMPTIONS. I MEAN WHAT IF YOU DO KNOW THAT YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL? THAT WOULD MEAN YOU'RE NO LONGER BEAUTIFUL. I MEAN THIS COULD SUBVERT THE ENTIRE FIELD OF BOY BAND EPISTEMOLOGY. OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER VICTIMS OF THIS CONFLICT, THE NEWS MEDIA. WITH ACCUSATIONS OF BIAS BEING HURLED FROM ALL SIDES, REPORTERS, ANCHORS AND PUNDITS ARE CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE. THOUGH OF COURSE NOT CNN'S CROSSFIRE. NOT EVEN U.N. INSPECTORS HAVE SEEN THAT SHOW. JUST LISTEN, LISTEN TO SOME OF THESE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS THAT THE MEDIA HAS A PRO-ISRAEL SLANT.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. JUST A FEW OF THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S INTERVIEWS ON AMERICAN NETWORKS IN RECENT WEEKS.
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS BEEN ON TELEVISION SO MUCH YOU WOULD THINK HE WAS AN ANCHOR, A COANCHOR ON SOME OF THESE SHOWS. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU AND ISRAEL PROPAGANDISTS  ARE LARGELY GIVEN CARTE BLANCHE TO SAY WHAT THEY WANT ON AMERICAN INFORMATION WITH LITTLE PUSHBACK.
LOOK HOW MUCH AIR TIME NETANYAHU AND HIS FOLKS HAVE ON AIR ON DAILY BASIS. I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE PALESTINIAN BEING INTERVIEWED. WE'RE RIDICULOUS. WE ARE DISGUSTINGLY BIASED WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE.
Stephen: REALLY? I DO NOT SEE A PRO-ISRAEL BIAS ON MSNBC OR ON CNN'S THE SITUATION KIBBUTZ BECAUSE GOD KNOWS CHARGES OF BIAS GO BOTH WAYS. HERE IS HOW THEY SAY THE MEDIA'S ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS WORKS.
WHAT ABOUT THIS CHARGE THAT WE HEAR FROM ISRAELI LEADERS AND SOME OF THEIR SUPPORTERS IN THE MEDIA THE PALESTINIANS DELIBERATELY DISPLAY DEAD BODIES TO SCORE PROPAGANDA POINTS. IS THAT A FAIR ALLEGATION.
YOU SEE THE PICTURE OF THE CIVILIAN DESTRUCTION AND THE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. SO IT'S ALMOST AN UNFAIR COMPARISON WHEN YOU SEE BODIES VERSUS TALKING HEADS.
THEY ARE LOSING THIS. THEY ONLY HAVE THE FACE OF BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. YOU CAN'T COMPETE WITH DEAD BODIES.
Stephen: SHE'S RIGHT. BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WAR WORKS. WE ALL KNOW WHOEVER HAS THE MOST DEAD BODIES WINS. (LAUGHTER) THANKFULLY, A GROUP CALLED THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS INSTITUTE HAS STEPPED IN TO END THE CONFLICT OVER REPORTING ON THIS CONFLICT. IT'S A NONPROFIT THAT PROMOTES PRESS FREEDOMS AROUND THE WORLD. AND IT HAS CREATED A HELPFUL GUIDE TO COVERING THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT CALLED USE WITH CARE, A REPORTER'S GLOSSARY OF LOADED LANGUAGE.
I'VE GOT THE LIST RIGHT HERE, ALL RIGHT. THIS IS THE ACTUAL LIST. SO I CAN REPORT ON THE CONFLICT WITHOUT USING ANY SENSITIVE TRIGGER WORDS. FOR INSTANCE, THE WORD TRIGGER. (LAUGHTER) AND TO HELP ME DO THAT, I'VE GOT MY INTERN JAY. JAY THE INTERN, COME ON OUT, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OKAY, NOW, FOLKS, JAY, GOOD TO SEE YOU MY FRIEND, NICE TO SEE YOU. NOW FOLKS, WHAT WE'VE DONE, JAY AND I HAVE SET UP A COMPUTERIZED MONITORING SYSTEM TO ALERT ME WITH THIS VERY COMPUTERY RED COMPUTER LIGHT, IF I INADVERTENTLY USE A WORD THAT IS OFFENSIVE TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER, IT WILL ALERT ME. NOW WITH THAT IN MIND, LET'S GET RIGHT TO THE LATEST FROM THESE DISPUTED AREAS.
WHAT WAS THAT. WHAT WAS THAT?
ARE YOU NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY DISPUTED AREAS. THE GUIDE SAYS THERE IS TECHNICALLY A DISPUTE BUT PRO PALESTINIANS FEEL THAT REFERENCE TO DISPUTED AREAS LEGITIMIZES THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT'S CONTROL OF THEM.
Stephen: OKAY. THEN I WILL CALL THEM SHOOTY PLACES. (LAUGHTER) NOW TO THE LATEST UPDATE ON THE AGGRESSION-- WAIT WHAT DID I SAY.
AGGRESSION. ISRAELIS FIND THE WORD PROBLEMATIC WHEN USED TO DESCRIBE MILITARY OPERATIONS.
Stephen: THAT'S PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE. OKAY THEN ON TO THE LATEST MEASURES --
NO MEASURES.
Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT, BECAUSE THAT IMPLIES SOMEONE THOUGHT BEFORE DOING SOMETHING. OKAY, OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS. WE NOW TURN TO THE LATEST ACTIONS. ACTIVITY TODAY THINGS OCCURRED--  (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MEANWHILE IN JERUSALEM-- IT'S THE NAME OF A CITY. (LAUGHTER) BUT IT'S A VERY DISPUTED AREA.
AHA!! NOT SO EASY, IS IT, JAY. YOU KNOW WHAT, JUST FORGET THIS WHOLE THING. THE ENTIRE SITUATION IS [BLEEP]. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH, WELL, GREAT, WELL GREAT. WELL THEN WE'LL HAVE COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THIS CLUSTER [BLEEP] UNTIL THEY REACH A FINAL SETTLEMENT. CLOSURE-- HUMMUS-- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. SERIOUSLY? I CAN'T SAY THAT?
