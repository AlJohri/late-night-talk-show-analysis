STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I NEED IT TONIGHT. THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY TO SAY BUT I WANT TO ISSUE A RARE CORRECTION. (LAUGHTER) LAST WEEK, I BROKE THE STORY THAT YOU WOULD SOON BE DEAD IT TURNS OUT YOU ARE NOT AND, FOR THAT, I APOLOGIZE. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE, AS WE ALL KNOW, EBOLA HAS REACHED AMERICA, BUT EVER SINCE THE FIRST CASE WAS IDENTIFIED, THE C.D.C. HAS STEPPED IN TO ISOLATE THE VIRUS, MONITOR ANYONE AT RISK, AND CONTAIN ANY CHANCE OF FURTHER INFECTION. YOU CAN SLEEP SOUNDLY. THERE WILL BE NO EBOLA OUTBREAK IN THE UNITED STATES... IS WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE! JIM?
ARE AMERICANS BEING TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT THE THREAT OF THIS VERY DEADLY DISEASE?
I HEARD THE C.D.C. CHIEF SAY IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I HEARD THE HOSPITAL SAY, DON'T WORRY. WE HAVE THIS UNDER CONTROL. I'M NOT SURE WE CAN TRUST ANYONE.
AN EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN SAYS THE C.D.C. IS LYING.
THEY HAVE BEEN DOWNPLAYING THIS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. I DON'T THINK AMERICANS ARE GOING TO JUST SIT BACK AND GO, IT'S COOL, THE GOVERNMENT HAS IT TAKEN CARE OF, BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT HAS GOT IT TAKEN CARE OF.
THE C.D.C., THE CENTERS FOR DENIAL AND CONFUSION ARE DOWNPLAYING THE DANGERS TO AMERICANS ALMOST TO THE POINT OF LYING TO THEM.
STEPHEN: THE C.D.C., THE COALITION FOR DECEPTION AND COERCION IS LYING! THEY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'VE GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL. BUT LOOK AT THEIR TRACK RECORD. BACK IN THE '90S, THEY LET THAT INFECTED MONKEY FROM "OUTBREAK" ESCAPE, THEN HE SHARED AN ICE CREAM CONE WITH ROSS FROM "FRIENDS," AND NOW GWYNETH PALTROW IS DEAD. (APPLAUSE) SO I DON'T TRUST THE C.D.C. OR COVEN OF DEVIANTS AND CHARLATANS I LISTEN TO TV PUNDITS BECAUSE WE TREAT EVERYTHING LIKE IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD.
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN JOSH EARNEST SAYS SCREENING PROCEDURES ARE IN PLACE AT OUR BORDER AND PEOPLE ARE SCREENED AS SOON AS THEY GET HERE. REALLY? YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? WHAT IS THAT? YOU'RE SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO PANIC? YOU DON'T WANT US TO PANIC? HOW ABOUT I DON'T WANT US TO DIE?
STEPHEN: YEAH! YEAH! OBAMA WANTS CAN YOU TO LINE UP FOR A CALM AND ORDERLY DEATH. WHAT'S THAT? WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE SAYING? THIS IS MY DEAF EAR? AND NOBODY'S TALKING? THEN WHY AM I HEARING VOICES? IS THAT BECAUSE OF EBOLA? WHAT'S THAT? IT'S AN UNRELATED MENTAL DISORDER? ALL RIGHT THEN, AS LONG AS I DON'T CATCH WHATEVER PARALYZED HER EYEBROWS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BAD, BAD! NO, BAD! POINT IS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS INCOMPETENT. WE SIMPLY CAN'T TRUST THEM TO CONTAIN EBOLA. IT SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO STATES. AND MY HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA ALREADY HAS A POTENTIAL PLAN TO ERADICATE THE VIRUS. AS FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA G.O.P. AND CURRENT MIDDLE SCHOOL DEBATE CLUB TREASURER, TOM KINCANNON TWEETED... THE PROTOCOL FOR A POSITIVE EBOLA TEST SHOULD BE IMMEDIATE, HUMANE EXECUTION AND SANITIZATION OF THE WHOLE AREA. THAT WILL SAVE LIVES. FINALLY, A WAY TO SAVE LIVES. HUMANELY EXECUTE THE VICTIM. OF COURSE, THE SHOTGUN BLAST TO HIS CHEST COULD SPREAD SOME BODILY FLUIDS. SO, TO BE SAFE, SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO COMPASSIONATELY MURDER WHOEVER EXECUTED THE PATIENT. AND THAT PERSON, OF COURSE, WILL HAVE TO BE SENSITIVELY BLUDGEONED TO DEATH BY A FOURTH PERSON, AND SO ON UNTIL THE CHAIN OF HUMANE HOMICIDE MAKES IT BACK TO WHOEVER'S WONDERFUL IDEA THIS WAS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
