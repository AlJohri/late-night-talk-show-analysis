Stephen: TONIGHT, SHOULD  CHURCHES ENDORSE CANDIDATES? WELL, CAN YOU MAKE AN ATTACK AD  OUT OF STAINED GLASS? (LAUGHTER)  THEN, THE CANDIDATES PREPARE FOR  TOMORROW NIGHT'S DEBATE. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS A WHOLE NEW  SET OF LONG PAUSES TO MEMORIZE. (LAUGHTER)  AND MY GUEST IS UNIVISION NEWS  ANCHOR JORGE RAMOS. BUT IT'S MY SHOW SO I'M GOING TO  CALL HIM GEORGE RAYMOND. (LAUGHTER)  THE LEAD SINGER OF CREED SAYS HE  WON'T ENDORSE PRESIDENT OBAMA! WELL, THAT SETTLES IT, OBAMA  WILL NOT WIN THE 1998  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  "REPORT" EVERYBODY, GOOD TO SEE  YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE "REPORT."  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WELL, FOLKS, THAT IS THE SONG  THAT NEVER ENDS. (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, TODAY IS THE BIGGEST DAY  IN THE HISTORY OF PUBLISHING. SINCE STEVE GUTTENBERG INVENTED  THE BIBLE. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE TODAY IS THE OFFICIAL  PUBLISHING DATE OF MY NEW BOOK  "AMERICA AGAIN: REBECOMING THE GREATNESS WE NEVER WEREN'T."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I WROTE IT! WHAT! WHOO! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! STOP, STOP, STOP! JIMMY, JIMMY, WHAT'S WITH THE  BALLOONS? I THOUGHT WE AGREED WE WERE  GOING TO DROP BOOKS. (LAUGHTER)
THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU,  STEPHEN, THEY'RE TOO HEAVY.
Stephen: WELL, OBVIOUSLY WE  WOULD FILL THEM WITH HELIUM! DUH! (LAUGHTER)  ANYWAY, AMERICA AGAIN SETS FORTH  BOLD ACTION STEPS THAT AVERAGE  AMERICANS CAN TAKE TO RECLAIM OUR COUNTRY'S GREATNESS. ACTION STEP NUMBER ONE: BUY MY  BOOK. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, FOR MY YOUNGER VIEWERS OUT  THERE, A BOOK IS SOMETHING WE  USED TO HAVE BEFORE THE  INTERNET. IT'S SORT OF A BLOG FOR PEOPLE  WITH ATTENTION SPANS. (LAUGHTER)  IT MAKES A GREAT GIFT FOR THE  HOLIDAYS, FOLKS: CHRISTMAS,  CHANUKAH, BLACK CHANUKAH. SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR HOLIDAY  SHOPPING DONE. THIS IS PERFECT FOR GRANDMAS,  MOTHERS, SONS, MEN NOT OF WOMAN  BORN, LOVERS, ENEMIES, TODDLERS. THEY LOVE CHEWING ON THE CORNERS  THEY SOFTEN UP AFTER A WHILE. JUST REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE  POISON FLAVOR STRIP. (LAUGHTER)  SO I'VE DONE MY PART, FOLKS. THE ANSWERS TO ALL YOUR PROBLEMS  ARE IN HERE. AND IF THE ANSWER ISN'T IN HERE  THEN IT'S NOT A PROBLEM-- YOU'RE  THE PROBLEM. SUCK IT UP. (LAUGHTER)  AND FOLKS--  (APPLAUSE)   FOLKS, MY BOOK COMES JUST IN  TIME BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY 35  SHOPPING DAYS LEFT BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THE KOCH BROTHERS WERE SMART,  THEY BOUGHT THEIR CANDIDATE  EARLY. OH, I CANNOT WAIT TO FIND OUT  WHAT'S IN THAT BEAUTIFUL  PACKAGE. I JUST WANT TO SHAKE IT. WHAT ARE YOUR LOOPHOLES. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CLOSE THEM? ANYWAY WHILE OUR CORPORATE  CITIZENS GET TO MAKE THEIR PICK  THIS ELECTIONS, SADLY AMERICA'S  CHURCHES DON'T GET A VOTE. I DON'T SEE WHY NOT. JESUS HAS A VALID PHOTO I.D. (LAUGHTER)  THESE RELIGIOUS-- THESE  RELIGIOUS RIGHT HAVE BEEN DENIED  BY AN OPPRESSIVE LAW THAT SAYS  IN ORDER FOR CHURCHES TO QUALIFY FOR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS THEY ARE  ABSOLUTELY PRINTD FROM DIRECTLY  OR INDIRECTLY PARTICIPATING IN  OR INTERVENING IN ANY POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ON BEHALF OF OR IN  OPPOSITION TO ANY CANDIDATE FOR  ELECTIVE PUBLIC OFFICE. FOLKS, THIS LAW IS JUST ANOTHER  EXAMPLE OF OBAMA'S WAR ON  RELIGION. WHICH HE CLEVERLY PASSED IN  1954. (LAUGHTER)  BUT NOW SOME BRAVE RELIGIOUS  LEADERS HAVE BANDED TOGETHER TO  FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHT TO PARTYFY FILL UNITED NATIONS.
Stephen: SOME ONE THOUSAND  PASTORS NATIONWIDE ARE PREPARING  TO DELIVER A SERMON THE I.R.S. MAY NOT WANT TO HEAR. THEY'RE TRYING TO DRAW ATTENTION  TO A 1954 TAX CODE THAT  PROHIBITS TAX-EXEMPT  ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CHURCHES FROM ENGAGING IN POLITICAL  ENDORSEMENTS A GROUP KNOWN AS  THE I AY LINES DEFENDING FREEDOM  IS NOW CHALLENGING THE CODE CLAIMING IT VIOLATES PREACHER'S  RIGHT FOR FREE SPEECH.
THEY'VE MARCHED OCTOBER 7 AS  PULPIT FREEDOM SUNDAY.
YES, PULPIT FREEDOM SUNDAY. WHEN THE THRILL OF LENGTHY  SERMONS FINALLY MEETS THE  EXCITEMENT OF TAX POLICY. PULPIT FREEDOM SUNDAY IS THE  BOLDEST THEOLOGICAL MOVEMENT  SINCE CASUAL GOOD FRIDAY. THIS SUNDAY, OCTOBER 7 PASTORS  AROUND THE UNITED STATES WILL  VIOLATE THE LAW BY DIRECTLY  ENDORSING ONE OF THE CANDIDATES. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH, EITHER  ROMNEY OR NOT-OBAMA. (LAUGHTER)  AND TO TRY TO FORCE THIS ISSUE  INTO COURT THE SERMONS WILL BE  RECORDED AND SENT TO THE I.R.S. FOLKS, I LIKE THIS NEW REBEL  ATTITUDE FROM THE PULPIT. MAYBE SOMEDAY WE'LL TURN ON FOX  NEWS AND SEE A HIGH-SPEED  POPEMOBILE CHASE. (LAUGHTER)  PASTOR JIM GARLOW, ONE OF THE  LEADERS BEHIND FREEDOM SUNDAY  SAYS IT'S ALL ABOUT PRINCIPLE.
WE BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE NO  GOVERNMENTAL INTRUSION IN THE  PULPIT AT ALL. A PASTOR SHOULD BE-- IF HE WANTS  TO ENDORSE OR A OPPOSE A  CANDIDATE. AND THAT SHOULD BE THE RIGHT OF  THE PASTOR BASED UPON THE FIRST  AMENDMENT. FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF  RELIGION. NO GOVERNMENTAL INTRUSION INTO  THE PULPIT.
I DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT  PROTECTING ME FROM SPEECH, I AM  A MATURE FREE-THINKING AMERICAN CAPABLE OF MAKING MY OWN  RATIONAL DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH  CANDIDATE MY PRIEST SAID GOT  WANTS KNOW PICK. (LAUGHTER)  AND, FOLKS, IT SHOULD NOT STOP  THERE, I WANT MY RELIGIOUS  LEADERS TO WEIGH IN ON  EVERYTHING. JUDICIAL RACES, SCHOOL BOARD  ELECTIONS, BOND ISSUES, THE  BALLOT INITIATIVE CREATING A  DEDICATED TRAFFIC SIGNAL IN THE LEFT TURN LANE IN FRONT OF THE  ARBY'S BECAUSE LO HAVING TO GO  ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MAPLE, MAKE  A RIGHT AND THEN TAKE THAT ROUND ABOUT JUST TO GET BACK TO THE  DRIVE THROUGH DOTH MAKE THE  ANGELS WEEP. I MEAN, CAN I GET AN AMEN? (AUDIENCE REACTS)  HERE TO GIVE ME ANOTHER AMEN--  MAYBE AS GOOD AS THAT ONE-- IS  ONE OF THE BOLD LEADERS OF PULPIT FREEDOM SUNDAY, A MAN  WITH THE PARABLES AND THE PAIR  OF BALLS. PASTOR JIM GARLOW. PASTOR JIM, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  COMING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HOW MANY YEARS HAVE BEEN DOING  THIS?
THIS IS THE FIFTH YEAR.
Stephen: SO YOU GUYS HAVE  BEEN BASICALLY TRYING TO POKE  THE HORNET'S NEST OF THE I.R.S. FOR FIVE YEARS SO THEY'LL TAKE  YOU TO COURT OVER THE THIS  UNJUST LAW. WHY HAVEN'T THEY DONE IT YET?
I ASSUME THEY THINK THEY'RE  GOING TO LOSE. WE HAD THAT PRIVILEGE FOR 166  YEARS IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND  THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY 58 YEARS  AGO AND OUR LINE WAS SIMPLE: NO GOVERNMENTAL INTRUSION INTO THE  LIFE OF THE CHURCH AT ALL.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE  CHURCH HAS GOING FOR THEM RIGHT  NOW. WHICH I REALLY LOVE. YOU'VE GOT THIS TAX-FREE THING  GOING ON. (LAUGHTER)  CAN I GET IN ON THAT? BECAUSE--  (LAUGHTER)  I'VE GOT A SUPER PAC BUT  DONATIONS TO ME ARE NOT TAX  DEDUCTIONS AND AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO USE AFTERTAX MONEY FOR  THEIR POLITICAL SPEECH. BUT YOU GUYS GET TO USE PRE-TAX  MONEY FOR POLITICAL SPEECH. I'D LOVE TO HAVE MY POLITICAL  SPEECH SUBSIDIZED BY THE  GOVERNMENT JUST LIKE THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM TAKE  THAT UP WITH THOMAS JEFFERSON  AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN BECAUSE  THEY BELIEVED IN SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE AND NO  GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL AND THE  SUPREME COURT WOULD LATER RULE  IF THE GOVERNMENT TAXES THE CHURCH IT THEREBY CAN CONTROL  AND DESTROY ANYTHING THAT IT  TAXES AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND  FREEDOM OF RELIGION IS THE FIRST  AMENDMENT. THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR.
Stephen: SO SEPARATION OF  CHURCH AND STATE I'VE NEVER BEEN  A BIG FAN OF. I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD PREACH YOUR  RELIGIOUS BELIEFS WHEN YOU  ADVISE PEOPLE HOW TO VOTE. DO YOU AGREE?
Stephen: YES.
OKAY, I'M GLAD I'VE ALWAYS  SUPPORTED MITT ROMNEY BECAUSE  IT'S IN CONFLICT WITH MY  CATHOLIC FACE BECAUSE I KNOW HE'S A MEMBER OF A CULT, OKAY? (LAUGHTER)  BUT NOW NOW I'M FREE TO EXERCISE  MY CATHOLIC BELIEF THAT HE'S AN  APOSTATE HERETIC WHO SHOULD NOT HOLD THE HIGH FEST JOB IN THE  LAND IN GOD'S CHOSEN COUNTRY. DO YOU BELIEVE I SHOULD BE ABLE  TO PREACH THAT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I ABSOLUTELY DO. IF YOU'RE A PREACHER--.
Stephen: HOW AM I NOT A  PREACHER? THIS IS MY CONGREGATION  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S A GREAT CONGREGATION.
Stephen: YOU SHOULD SEE WHEN  I PASS THE HAT. (LAUGHTER)
WHETHER A PASTOR IS  CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL HE OUGHT  TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY THAT IN  HIS PULPIT, PERIOD.
Stephen: LIKE THAT BECAUSE--
OTHERWISE WE HAVE TO HAVE  PULPIT POLICE IN EVERY CHURCH  MONITORING THEIR SPEECH.
Stephen: I DO BELIEVE THAT  PREACHERS OR PRIESTS OR  RELIGIOUS LEADERS SHOULD BE ABLE  TO SAY ANYTHING THEY WANT BECAUSE FREE SPEECH SHOULD BE  ABSOLUTE AND I BELIEVE THAT. ONE OF THE REASONS I LOVE IT IS  THAT I DON'T THINK, A, THERE'S  ENOUGH RELIGION IN OUR POLITICS  BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE'S NOT ENOUGH POLITICS IN OUR RELIGION. I KNOW NOW IF A PREACHER SAYS  VOTE FOR X CANDIDATE OR Y  CANDIDATE AND THAT CANDIDATE  LOSES I KNOW I'VE GOT A LOSER GOD, STOCK? (LAUGHTER)  OR IF THAT CANDIDATE TURNS OUT  TO BE CORRUPT I KNOW MY GOD WAS  FALSE AND I CAN MOVE ON TO A NEW  ONE. DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S ONE OF  THE NICE THINGS ABOUT GETTING  POLITICS ALL OVER RELIGION IS  THAT WE CAN GET THAT KIND OF ACRIMONY AND THAT HATE TOWARD  EACH OTHER OVER OUR RELIGIONS IN  A FRESH WAY? (LAUGHTER)  LAUGH. >>.
YOUR GOD IS PROBABLY JUST  FINE, MAYBE YOU HAD A LOSER  PREACHER. THE PASTOR OUGHT TO SAY WHAT HE  WANTS. WE'RE NOT SAYING A PASTOR HAS TO  ENDORSE WE'RE SAYING HE OUGHT TO  HAVE THAT RIGHT IF HE WANTS TO.
Stephen: WHO ARE YOU  ENDORSING?
NOT ANYBODY ON THIS SHOW.
Stephen: HEY!
I WILL IN MY PULPIT THIS  SUNDAY.
GIVE ME A HINT.
Stephen:
I WANT TO INVITE YOU TO BE A  GUEST IN MY PULPIT AND SPEAK IN  MY CHURCH IN SAN DIEGO. WILL YOU COME? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'M ON A BOOK TOUR RIGHT NOW  B. CAN I TAKE A RAIN CHECK? DR. JIM GARLOW, SENIOR PASTOR AT  SKYLINE WESLEY JANUARY CHURCH.
