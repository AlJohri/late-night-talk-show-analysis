Stephen: TONIGHT A NEW BENEFIT FOR COLLEGE ATHLETES FOR ONE DAY ONLY, WE'RE PUTTING AN I IN TEAM. THEN IS AMERICA RUNNING OUT OF A FAVORITE FOOD? OR DID WE JUST LOSE IT IN OUR FOLDS. AND MY GUEST IS KENTUCKY BASKETBALL COACH JOHN CALIPARI, DAMN, I HAD THE COACH FROM DUKE IN MY BRACKET. MARKET ANALYSTS SAY THAT iPAD FEVER IS COOLING. MEANWHILE KINDLE DYSENTERY STILL RUNS RAMPANT. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Stephen: HELL YEA!, BOOM, RIGHT THERE, OH YEAH, WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE, PLEASE, SIT DOWN, FOLKS, IN HERE AND IF ANYBODY AT HOME IS STANDING UP TAKE A SQUAT, FOLKS, YOU WATCH THIS SHOW. YOU KNOW I LOVE NUMBERED LISTS. ONE, TWO, THREE. I COULD GO ON. THE MAIN REASON I LOVE THEM IS BECAUSE AMERICA IS ALWAYS AT THE TOP. WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN BILLIONAIRES, WORKER PRODUCTIVITY, AND PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION BEHIND BARS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YES. HELL YEAH! EAT THAT RWANDA. BUT SADLY I MAY BE FALLING OUT OF LOVE WITH LISTS. HERE'S THE NUMBER ONE REASON WHY.
HELLO, CANADA, YOU ARE NUMBER ONE. THAT'S THE FINDING AT A NEW REPORT CANADA'S MIDDLE CLASS PASSING AMERICA. FOR THE FIRST TIME AS THE MOST AFFLUENT IN THE WORLD.
IN CANADA AVERAGE INCOME WORKERS HAVE ENJOYED A NEARLY 20% RAISE SINCE 2000. BUT HERE IN THE U.S. MIDDLE CLASS WORKERS WAGES HAVE BEEN VIRTUALLY FLAT FOR 14 YEARS.
THE U.S. HAS NOW BEEN SURPASSED BY THE MIDDLE CLASS IN CANADA.
YES, CANADA'S MIDDLE CLASS IS BEATING OURS. THEIR WORKERS ARE BRINGING HOME MORE OF THE BACON. AND WORSE, IT'S THAT ROUND [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER) NO LONGER WILL PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ASPIRE TO THE AMERICAN DREAM OF A HOUSE, A WHITE PICKET FENCE, 2.5 KIDS. NO, NOW IT'S THE CANADIAN DREAM OF A BEAVER DAM, A MAPLE SYRUP MOAT AND 2.5 MEMBERS OF RUSH. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I DON'T WANT TO TEACH GEDDY LEE TO PLAY CATCH. HOW IS CANADA'S MIDDLE CLASS DOING SO WELL? I MEAN THEY'VE GOT SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE AND HIGH TAXES FOR THE RICH. I MEAN IT POLITELY BOGGLES THE MIND. (LAUGHTER) I THINK THERE ARE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE REASONS WHY WE ARE FALLING BEHIND THE ICE HOLES. ONE, ONE POSSIBLE REASON, AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS IS LAZY. OR TWO, AMERICA DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY. I'M GOING TO GO WITH THAT ONE, OKAY. JUST THINK ABOUT IT, FOLKS. HOW CAN WE RICH TRICKLE DOWN PROSPERITY TO EVERYONE ELSE UNLESS WE HAVE ALL THE MONEY FIRST. OUR CUP MUST FILLETH BEFORE IT RUNNETH OVER. CLEARLY CONGRETH HATH  ESTIMATETH THE SIZE OF MY CUPPETH. BUT I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOUR FAITH IN SUPPLY-SIDE ECONOMICS. BECAUSE THE TOP 1% ARE LIKE A SLOT MACHINE. WE'RE ALL WARMED UP AND JUST ABOUT TO PAY OFF, OKAY. JUST KEEP SHOVING IN THOSE QUARTERS. I DON'T EVEN CARE WHERE YOU PUT THEM. JUST WARM THEM UP FIRST. NOW NATION, I'M A DIEHARD SPORTS FAN. IN THAT IF NONE OF THE DIEHARD MOVIES ARE ON, I WILL WATCH SPORTS. THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, I HAVE WARNED YOU (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, I HAVE WARNED YOU ABOUT THE DANGERS OF UNIONIZING COLLEGE SPORTS. LAST MONTH NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS WERE ALLOWED TO FORM A UNION. WHAT IDIOT TAUGHT THEM TO WORK TOGETHER TOWARD A COMMON GOAL? AND EVER SINCE COLLEGIATE LETS HAVE BEEN GRIPING, LIKE SHABAZZ NAPIER, STAR POINT GUARD OF THE CHAMPION UCONN HUSKIES.
AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT DOESN'T COVER EVERYTHING. WE DO HAVE HUNGRY NIGHTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET FOOD. I DON'T THINK, YOU KNOW, STUDENT ATHLETES SHOULD GET HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. LIKE I SAID THERE ARE HUNGRY NIGHTS THAT I GO TO BED AND I'M STARVING.
Stephen: OH, THAT IS WRONG. WHAT ARE YOU DOING GOING TO BED? YOU SHOULD BE PRACTICING. YOU GOT TIME TO LAY DOWN, YOU GOT TIME TO LAY UP. SADLY, FOLKS, THE NCAA HEARD HIS STARVED RAMBLINGS AND CRUMBLED FASTER THAN AN UNDERFED POINT GUARD.
THE NCAA HAS ANNOUNCED COLLEGIATE LETS CAN NOW RECEIVE UNLIMITED MEALS AND SNACKS. THE NEW RULE APPLIES TO BOTH SCHOLARSHIP ATHLETES AND WALK-ONS.
Stephen: UNLIMITED MEALS AND SNACKS. I MEAN WHO DO THESE PLAYERS THINK THEY ARE, BASKETBALL FANS? (LAUGHTER) COLLEGE ATHLETES NEED TO STAY HUNGRY, IT MOTIVATES THEM TO WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS. SO THAT DURING THE GATORADE DUMP THEY CAN SUCK ELECTROLYTES OFF THE COACH'S WINDBREAKER. AND I KNOW, THE ONLY REASON FOOTBALL PLAYERS STRIVE TO MAKE THE TOSTITOS BOWL IS OUT OF HOPE IT IS AN ACTUAL BOWL OF TOSTITOS. WORST OF ALL, THESE FREE SNACKS VIOLATE THE NUMBER ONE RULE OF SPORTS. ONLY WINNERS GET ICE CREAM. LOSERS HAVE THEIR OWN PRIZE, A SILENT CAR RIDE HOME WITH DAD. (LAUGHTER) IF YOU'RE SO HUNGRY, MISTER, EAT THE TENSION. NEXT UP ON THE SPORT REPORT, COCK-FIGHTING. FOLKS, I LOVE THE SWEET AND SOUR SCIENCE, THE SPORT OF CHICKEN A LA KING. COCK FIGHTING IS LIKE MIXED MARTIAL ARTS MEETS KFC'S MIXED GRILL BUCKET. UNFORTUNATELY FOR COCKTHUSIASTS LIKE MYSELF, I HAVE SOME BAD COCK-A-DOODLE NEWS. BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW ANTI-COCK-FIGHTING BILL IN LOUISIANA THAT HAS STATE SENATOR ELBERT GUILLORY CRYING YOU WILL FOWL SAYING THIS BILL IS FOR THE BIRDS AND IT'S REALLY RUFFLED HIS FEATHERS. DRUM STICKS.
THE STATE SENATOR SAYS THE BILL THREATENS A SPORT HE CALLS CHICKEN BOXING.
SENATOR ELBERT CALLS CHICKEN BOXING A LEGITIMATE SPORT.
GUILLORY SAYS CHICKEN BOXING IS SIMILAR TO HUMAN BOX, THAT THE MATCHES ARE NOT FOUGHT TO THE DEATH.
Stephen: YES, CHICKEN BOXING, IT'S JUST LIKE HUMAN BOXING EXCEPT WHEN IT'S OVER THE CHICKENS HAVE BETTER SHORT-TERM MEMORY. AND FOLKS, IT IS PERFECTLY SAFE. SENATORS GUILLORY EXPLAINED THAT THE CHICKENS CAN ENGAGE IN THEIR SPORT WITHOUT HURTING EACH OTHER. THEY PUT LITTLE BOXING GLOVES ON THEM AND THEY FIGHT IN ROUNDS SO THEY CAN GET WATER AND COOL OFF. IF THEY'RE HOT THEY GET WATER AND IF THEY'RE LOSING THEY GET OLIVE OIL, SALT AND PEPPER AND A SQUEEZE OF LEMON. PLUS CHICKEN BOXING HAS STRICT RULES LIKE EACH COMBATANT SHALL WEAR STANDARD FOWL SAFETY BOXING GEAR. YES, JUST YOUR STANDARD FOWL SAFETY BOXING GEAR. JUST CHECK THE POULTRY COUNTER AT THE SPORTS AUTHORITY. PERSONALLY I DO HOPE THAT INCLUDES A MOUTH GUARD BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN TOO MANY CHICKENS WITHOUT ANY TEETH. SADLY, FOLKS, THE LOUISIANA SENATE HAS REJECTED THIS REASONABLE CHICKEN BOXING AMENDMENT. BUT I WANT TO SALUTE GUILLORY FOR TRYING TO KEEP BIG GOVERNMENT OUT OF OUR CHICKEN SPORTING EVENTS. BECAUSE WHERE DOES IT END? FIRST IT'S COCK-FIGHTING, NOW CHICKEN BOXING, AM I GOING TO HAVE TO CLOSE MY CHICKEN DOJO? (LAUGHTER) WHAT'S NEXT, NO MORE POULTRY JOUSTING? YOU TELL ME, LOUISIANA SENATE, WHAT MANNER OF CHICKEN COMBAT SHALL YOUR LAW ALLOW? JUST TELL US THE WAY WE CAN HAVE CHICKENS ATTACK EACH OTHER FOR OUR AMUSEMENT AND WE WILL DO IT. AND DON'T YOU DARE SAY CHICKEN NASCAR. BECAUSE SURE THEY CAN WORK THE GAS PEDAL BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO SHIFT AND THEY'RE ALWAYS BURNING OUT THE TRANSMISSION. SO PLEASE, I BEG YOU, LEGALIZE CHICKEN BOXING. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS NOT ABOUT HUMANS WATCHING BIRDS PUMMEL EACH OTHER. IT'S ABOUT HELPING THE CHICKENS. BOXING GIVES THEM A PATH IN LIFE, A ONE WAY TICKET OUT OF PALOOKAVILLE. SO THAT NONE OF THEM HAS TO TURN TO THEIR OLDER BROTHER ONE DAY AND SAY IT WAS YOU, CHARLIE. I COULD HAVE HAD CLASS. I COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY. I COULD HAVE BEEN-- A CHICKEN TENDER.
