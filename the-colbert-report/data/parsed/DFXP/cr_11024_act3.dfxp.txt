HI.
Stephen: LOVELY TO HAVE YOU HERE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: EVERYONE IS EXCITED, AS YOU CAN SEE.   ( CHEERS )
OKAY!
Stephen: FOR THOSE UNDER A ROCK, YOU'RE THE OSCAR AND GOLDEN GLOBE-WINNING ACTRESS BEST KNOWN FOR "WINTER'S BONE" "X-MEN" MOVIES, "SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK,"  AND, OF COURSE, THE "HUNGER GAMES" FRANCHISE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SO THE NEXT ONE IS CALLED-- HELP ME OUT HERE?
MOCKINGJAY, PART 1.
Stephen: BECAUSE IT IS THE THIRD INSTALLMENT IN THE RARE FOUR-PART TRILOGY
DON'T TRICK ME WITH MATH.
Stephen: I'LL TRY NOT TO. YOU'RE SUCH A SUCCESS AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE. YOU'RE 24 YEARS  OLD, RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: A COUPLE OSCARS. A COUPLE GOLDEN GLOBES
ONE.
Stephen: ON OSCAR? YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN TWO. YOU WERE RIPPED OFF. BUT AT THIS POINT, AT 24, YOU COULD JUST START PHONING IT IN RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOING SO WELL. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF PULLING THE RIP CORD AND GOING  "I'M DONE" AT 24.
I HAVE A FEELING IT WILL HAPPEN FOR ME. I FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. I'M CONSTANTLY WAITING FOR EVERYTHING TO FALL APART.
Stephen: NO, NO, NO. YOU COULD RIDE THIS FOR A LONG TIME. YOU'RE IN THE IN MEMORIAM REEL ALREADY AT THIS POINT.
EVERY TIME MY PHONE RINGS I'M LIKE, "IT'S OVER."
Stephen:  I'M PULLING THE RIP CORD IN 16 MORE SHOWS. LET'S SAY YOU AND I DROP OUT--
Audience: OOOOH!
Stephen: IT WILL BE FUN. THE TWO OF US WILL GO FIGHT CRIME TOGETHER.
OKAY, YEAH.
Stephen: NO ONE WILL KNOW. WE'LL WEAR LITTLE MASKS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NEW MOVIE AND YOU, BECAUSE KATNISS EVERDEAN, AREN'T YOU LIKE HER A LITTLE BIT? BECAUSE YOU'RE FROM KENTUCKY. ISN'T THAT A LITTLE DISTRICT 12IAN PLACE? THERE'S COAL MINING THERE.
THERE IS COAL MINING. I NEVER VOLUNTEERED FOR ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.
Stephen: NO ONE FORCED YOU TO COME HERE, I HOPE.
ESPECIALLY THIS.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU WERE A NORMAL PERSON.
I WAS.
Stephen: WELL YOU'RE A SUPERSTAR NOW
I WAS AND THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED. AND NOW I'M MADE OF RUBBER.
Stephen: DO THINGS BOUNCE OFF OF YOU?
OH, MY GOD. NOTHING DOES.
Stephen: REALLY?
NO, YEAH, NO, I GREW UP IN KENTUCKY, I MEAN, NOT SKINNING SQUIRRELS. ACTUALLY, I HAVE SKINNED A SQUIRREL BEFORE. I CAN'T EVEN SAY THAT.
Stephen: YOU JUST CAUGHT YOURSELF IN A LIE.
I WAS LIKE JENNIFER, YOU'VE EVEN EATEN SQUIRREL CHILI.
Stephen: I THINK WE MADE NEWS. BUT YOU WERE KIND OF PLUCKED FROM OBSCURITY AT A YOUNG AGE AND NOW YOU'RE A HERO TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. DO YOU IDENTIFY WITH YOUR CHARACTER AT ALL?
NO, IT'S SO DANGEROUS TO SAY THAT, BECAUSE SHE IS LEADING A REBELLION TO CHANGE THE WORLD. BUT I'M LIKE I NEED A NEW JUJE AND NEW LIPSTICK
Stephen: WHAT IS A JUJE?
A JUJE IS A HAIR FLUFF. MY HAIR PERSON IS PROBABLY FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW FOR ME TOUCHING IT. "JENNY! AGH!"
Stephen: OKAY, SO HOW DID YOU-- HOW-- HOW DID YOU PREPARE FOR THIS ROLE? DID YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY-- DID YOU DO A RIDE-ALONG? DID YOU KILL ANYBODY WITH A BOW AND ARROW?
YEAH, I DID A RIDE-ALONG WITH A LOT OF REBELS THAT WERE FIGHTING.
Stephen:  DO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO USE A BOW AND ARROW?
I DO, YEAH, I TOOK I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYMORE HOW MANY MONTHS OF ARCHERY, BUT A LOT OF MONTHS OF ARCHERY FOR THE FIRST MOVIE, AND A LITTLE BIT LESS MONTBS FOR THE SECOND MOVIE.
Stephen: AND THE THIRD MOVIE IS JUST ALL C.G.I. EXACTLY. THAT'S IT EXACTLY.
Stephen: DID YOU HOLD YOUR HAND AND THEY PUT THE BOW IN?
I JUST GO "FRA!" AND THEN PEOPLE DIE ON SCREEN. WE'RE LAUGHING BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF EXACTLY HOW IT WENT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY ANY SPOILERS, BUT IS THERE A "MOTHERINGJAY PART 2?" WE'LL SEE HOW THIS ONE GOES?
IT'LL JUST GO STRAIGHT TO THREE. YEAH, THERE IS A "MOCKINGJAY PART 2."
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP OF "MOCKINGJAY PART ONE."
THERE HAS BEEN RAMPANT SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THE QUARTER QUELL, AND HERE TO SHED A LITTLE  LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT FOR US IS A VERY SPECIAL GUEST. PLEASE WELCOME MR. PEETA MELLARK. PEETA, A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL AS THOUGH THEY ARE IN THE DARK.
YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW HOW THEY FEEL.
SO SET THE STAGE FOR US. TALK US THROUGH. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ON THAT FINAL AND CONTROVERSIAL NIGHT?
FIRST OFF, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE GAMES, YOU ONLY GET ONE  WISH. IT'S VERY COSTLY.
YOU'RE ALIVE.
Stephen: OH, MY GOD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DOES THE MOVIE HAVE A HAPPY ENDING WHERE ALL THE POOR PEOPLE ACCEPT LOW-PAYING JOBS AND NO UNIONS? ( LAUGHTER )
CLOSE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DEAD. BUT ALL IN ALL --
Stephen:  OTHER THAN THAT?
UPBEAT.
Stephen: VERY UPBEAT.
YEAH.
Stephen: AS SUCH A NICE PERSON-- YOU'RE KNOWN AS A NICE, NORMAL PERSON.
FOR NOW
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE-- DO YOU HAVE A PLAN TO FREAK OUT?
I'M GOING POSTAL.
Stephen: WE COULD PLAN YOUR DOWNWARD SPIRAL RIGHT NOW IF YOU WANT. WE COULD PICK THE DRUG AND THE CRIME.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT CRYSTAL METH AND BOOSTING CARS.
OH, BAD FOR THE SKIN.
Stephen:  LAST QUESTION, PEOPLE CALL YOU JLAW, DO YOU LIKE THAT NICKNAME?
I DON'T MIND IT. IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN MY NICKNAME SINCE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
Stephen: REALLY.
NOT EVEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, BUT MIDDLE SCHOOL.
Stephen:  ARE YOUR MOM AND DAD MLAW AND DLAW?
YEAH, WE'RE A PRETTY COOL FAMILY.
Stephen: WELL, JLAW, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. AND GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR COMING DOWNWARD SPIRAL. JENNIFER, THANK YOU SO MUCH. JENNIFER LAWRENCE, "THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKING JAY - PART 1", OPENS NEXT FRIDAY WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU.
