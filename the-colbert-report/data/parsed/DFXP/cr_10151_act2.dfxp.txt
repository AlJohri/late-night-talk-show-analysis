Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU GUYS ARE PAYING ATTENTION, I KNOW THE COLBERT NATION ALWAYS DOES, IT IS ABSOLUTELY NO BIG SECRET THAT OUR COUNTRY IS BEING TORN APART BY CHILDISH PARTISAN BICKERING AND OBAMA STARTED IT. WE'RE A CULTURE WAR, FOLKS, IT'S US VERSUS THEM. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THEM ARE, YOU COULD BE THEY. AND IT'S NOT JUST POLITICS, WE ALSO MUST PICK SIDES IN THE PRODUCTS WE BUY. THAT'S WHY I PATRONIZE ONLY CONSERVATIVE BUSINESSES, SAM'S CLUB INSED OF COSTCO, CHIK-FIL-A INSTEAD OF CHIPOTLE. HOBBY LOBBY INSTEAD OF WHATEVER THE PRO CONTRACEPTIVE CRAFT SUPERSTORE IS, I'M GUESSING SLUTS 'N STUFF. UNFORTUNATELY -- IT'S GOOD, IT'S A GOOD BUSINESS.  UNFORTUNATELY, NOT EVERY COMPANY JUST ADVERTISES WHICH SIDE THEY'RE ON. WELL, GOOD NEWS. AS THE KIDS SAY, THERE'S AN iPHONE APPLICATION PROGRAM TO DO THAT.
BIPARTISAN, THAT'S BUY, AN APP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SCAN THE BAR CODE OF YOUR FAVORITE GROCERY ITEM  AND FIND OUT JUST HOW MUCH MONEY THE COMPANY AND ITS C.E.O. GIVE TO EITHER PARTY. CHERRIOS GAVE 63.5% OF ITS POLITICAL DONATIONS TO REPUBLICANS. AND 24% TO DEMOCRATS.
Stephen: OF COURSE CHEERIOS LEANS REPUBLICAN. THEY'RE STRONG ON NATIONAL DEFENSE AND CHEERIOS ARE MADE BY A GENERAL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, AND YOUR FIBER, SIR. (APPLAUSE) SO LET'S TRY, LET'S TRY OUT THE APP CALLED BUY-PARTISAN WITH THIS NUTRIGRAIN BAR. OKAY. AND THERE YOU GO. AND GO. OKAY. IT SAYS HERE THAT IT'S MADE BY KELLOGG'S WHOSE POLITICAL DONATIONS AVERAGE 37.25% REPUBLICAN, 33.5% DEMOCRAT AND 29.25% OTHER. WHICH I ASSUME IS HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SIRRUP. NOW LET'S TRY THE SAME THING WITH, LET'S TRY THAT WITH STARBUCKS COFFEE. OKAY. IT SAYS HERE 80.75% DEMOCRAT. AND I'M SURE, I'M SURE-- I'M SURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 100% BUT THEY LEFT ROOM FOR MILK. AND I KNOW BUY-PARTISAN, THIS LITTLE APP HERE IS TRUSTWORTHY BECAUSE IT WAS DEVELOPED BY FORMER CAPITOL HILL STAFFER MATTHEW COLBERT. LIKE STAIRING IN A MIRROR, FOLKS. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT HERE. WE DON'T GET TO TALK THAT OFTEN BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY GREAT JOB ON THIS APP, COUSIN MATT. I MEAN IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE IN THE FAMILY WHO SHARES-- WAIT, DO YOU, HOLD ON. LET'S TRY IT WITH YOU. WHAT? IT IS AS HERE THAT MATTHEW COLBERT HAS ONLY ONE POLITICAL DONATION ON RECORD. HE GAVE $250 TO A DEMOCRAT. WELL, WELL THEN I CAN'T RECOMMEND YOUR PRODUCT, MATT. TOO BAD. I REALLY LIKED IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
