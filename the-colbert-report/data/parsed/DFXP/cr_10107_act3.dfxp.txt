WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW MEMOIR CALLED A FIGHTING CHANCE. SHE'S ABOUT TO GET A CHANCE TO FIGHT. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. (APPLAUSE) SENATOR WARREN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK. ALL RIGHT. WELL, FIRST OF ALL, LET ME SAY IT'S A PLEASURE TO  HAVE YOU BACK. IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
AND I WANT TO REMIND YOU THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE I DID NOT CALL YOU SENATOR, BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT A SENATOR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU ARE WELCOME FOR THE COLBERT BUMP.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I WILL GET MY TASTE ON THE BACK END, NO DOUBT. OKAY. SENIOR SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS, FORMER HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR WHO CAME WITH THE IDEA FOR THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, ALSO CHAIRED THE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT PANEL OF THE $700 BILLION TARP PROGRAM AND YOU HAVE WRITTEN NINE BOOKS, THE LATEST OF WHICH IS A FIGHTING CHANCE. WHO HAS GOT THE FIGHTING CHANCE HERE, SENATOR? ARE YOU THE PERSON FIGHTING OR IS AMERICA THE PEOPLE FIGHTING.
WELL, A LITTLE OF BOTH. LOOK I'M SOMEBODY WHO GREW UP ON THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. MY DADDY WAS A MAINTENANCE MAN MY MOM WORKED A MINIMUM WAGE JOB AT SEARS THERE WAS NO MONEY FOR COLLEGE.
DON'T YOU TRY TO OUTHUMBLE ME. I WILL NOT BE OUTHUMBLED. MY FATHER WAS AN APPALACHIAN TURD MINER, OKAY.
GOT IT BUT HERE WAS THE KEY DIFFERENCE. I GREW UP IN AN AMERICA THAT WAS INVESTING IN KIDS. IT WAS INVESTING IN PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IT HAD A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE. IT WAS AN AMERICA THAT SAID EVERY KID WOULD GET A FIGHTING CHANCE. AND THAT'S HOW WE BUILT AMERICA'S GREAT MIDDLE CLASS. THEN STARTING IN ABOUT THE 1980s WE TURNED IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
YOU MEAN WHEN REAGAN CAME IN AND IT WAS MORNING IN AMERICA. (LAUGHTER) THE DIRECTION TOWARD GREATNESS PRIDE.
YES, THAT IS THE RIGHT TIME, WHEN THIS HAPPENED. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
SO WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE SO FAR.
THAT'S RIGHT. AND WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT HE HAD A COUPLE OF IDEAS. THE FIRST ONE WAS THAT THEY WOULD FIRE THE COPS. NOT THE ONES ON MAIN STREET BUT THE ONES ON WALL STREET.
THE ONES WHO WERE SHACKLING CREATIVITY, AND INGENUITY IN OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
AND MAKING SURE THE BIGGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACTUALLY FOLLOWED THE LAW. THOSE WERE THE COPS THEY GOT RID OF.
THE LAW THAT IS A VAGUE TERM, LAW. ONE MAN'S LAW IS ANOTHER PERSON'S REGULATION. AND REGULATION IS BAD. REGULATION STIFLES BUSINESS AND STIFLES ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
NO, NO. NO, SEE IF WE DON'T HAVE SOME BASIC RULES THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THEN. AND THAT IS THE BIG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MADE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY CHEATING PEOPLE ON CREDIT CARDS, MORTGAGES.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CHEATING PEOPLE ON CREDIT CARDS. YOU SIGN UP FOR A CREDIT CARD, USE THE CREDIT CARD AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR BILLS, IS THAT TOO COMPLICATED FOR HARVARD?
OH.
SO YOU JUST ACCUSED REAGAN OF SUPPORTING CHEATING PEOPLE. THOSE WERE YOUR WORDS.
LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. IT WAS SUPPORTING HAVING THE REGULATORS LOOK THE OTHER WAY. WHILE THE BIGGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HID EVERY TRICK AND EVERY TRAP POSSIBLE IN CREDIT CARDS, IN MORTGAGES, IN CHECKING ACCOUNT RULES. AND THEY MADE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DOING IT. AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY LOADED UP ON RISK. AND WHAT ULTIMATELY HAPPENED BY 2008 WAS THAT THEY BROKE THE ECONOMY. THEY GOT BAILED OUT BY THE TAXPAYERS. THEY CONTINUED TO BREAK THE LAW IN FORECLOSING ON PEOPLE'S MORTGAGES.
BUT LET ME POINT SOMETHING OUT TO YOU. WE GAVE THEM A TON OF MONEY FOR TARP, OKAY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE MADE $52 BILLION. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE GOVERNMENT MADE $52 BILLION ON TARP. WE MADE A PROFIT, THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS WHO WERE BAILED OUT, WE LOST 7.5 BILLION ON THOSE PEOPLE.
OH.
AREN'T YOU BACKING THE WRONG HORSE HERE? THE BANK, THE BANKS GAVE US THE PROFITS, THE MIDDLE CLASS DOESN'T GIVE THE PROFIT BACK. WHY ARE YOU WORKING SO HARD TO HELP PEOPLE WHO AREN'T PAYING THEIR BILLS.
OH, SO --
AGAIN THIS IS A LOT OF FREELOADING I'M HEARING YOU REPORT. IT IS JUST MORE SOCIALISM.
YOU ARE RIGHT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF FREELOADING BUT THE FREELOADING HAS BEEN BY THE BIGGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WAS GOT BAILED-- .
WHO PAID US BACK.
THEY GOT BAILED OUT BY THE AMERICAN TAX PAYERS, WHO BROKE THE LAW AND WERE NEVER HELD RESPONSIBLE.
BROKE THE LAW, WHAT LAWS DID THEY BREAK? NAME ONE LAW THEY BROKE.
HOW ABOUT THE MORTGAGE LAWS THAT SAID THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW CERTAIN RULES WHEN THEY FORECLOSED AGAINST PEOPLE'S HOMES. AND WHAT THEY DID IN TEXAS, THEY SAID WE COULD SAVE A LOT OF MONEY IF WE DIDN'T FOLLOW THE LAW. THEY HAVE ADMITTED TO THAT BUT HERE IS THE KEY PART. NOBODY WENT TO JAIL FOR ANY PART OF THIS. THE ONLY PEOPLE IN AMERICA TODAY WHO GO TO JAIL ARE REGULAR FOLKS. BIG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GET OUT THERE, THEY LAUNDER DRUG MONEY, THEY VIOLATE THE LAW AND STILL NO ONE IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I THINK THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG, EVERYONE SHOULD--  (APPLAUSE)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WILL ASK YOU, JUST OUT OF POLITENESS, OUT OF POLITENESS DO NOT CHEER FOR ME IN THE MIDDLE OF HER ANSWER. (LAUGHTER)
YOU CANNOT-- THE REASON WHY YOU CANNOT SEND THESE PEOPLE TO JAIL IS, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET, HAVE YOU HEARD OF THAT.
YEAH.
YOU CAN'T PUT HANDCUFFS ON AN INVISIBLE HAND. THE COPS CAN'T FIND IT SO IT'S UP TO THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET TO SAY THIS IS THE WAY YOU MAKE MONEY IS TO --
YOU ARE JUST PUSHING THE ENVELOPE. WHAT YOU CALL BREAKING THE LAW I CALL PUSHING THE ENVELOPE.
WELL, YOU COULD PUT HANDCUFFS ON PEOPLE WHO PUSH THE ENVELOPE. WHEN THEY BREAK THE LAW THEY DESERVE TO HAVE HANDCUFFS THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE. NOW THIS IS--  (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I SEE HOW THIS WORKS. THIS IS WHAT THIS BOOK IS ALL ABOUT.
A FIGHTING CHANCE.
IT'S ABOUT WHOSE SIDE THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BE ON.
OKAY.
IS IT GOING TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE LARGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE LARGEST BANKS ON WALL STREET, THE ONES THAT CAN HIRE A LOT OF LOBBYISTS AND LAWYERS, OR IS IT GOING TO BE ON THE SIDE OF REAL PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WE--  (APPLAUSE)
WE CAN'T HAVE CAPITALISM IF THERE AREN'T RULES. NOBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO STEAL YOUR PURSE ON MAIN STREET OR BE ABLE TO STEAL YOUR PENSION ON WALL STREET.
THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS ARE YOU RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? (LAUGHTER)
NO, I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, OKAY. RIGHT NOW YOU'RE NOT RUNNING. A LONG TIME BETWEEN NOW AND 2016.
I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, OKAY. LAST QUESTION, ARE YOU RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? (LAUGHTER)
I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S A MAYBE. ELIZABETH WARREN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. THE BOOK IS A FIGHTING CHANCE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
