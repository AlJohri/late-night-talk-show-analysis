(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW AND I HOPE YOU DO YOU WILL KNOW IT IS NO SECRET THAT I AM AN ENORMOUS FAN OF FOX BUSINESS IT IS THE FIRST PLACE I TURN FOR FINANCIAL NEWS WHEN IT IS LEFT ON AT MY DENTIST. AND THERE IS NO ONE I LOVE MORE ON THE FA-BIZZLE THAN STU VARNEY. SO IT HURTS TO SEE STU AND FOX BUSINESS TANKING IN THE RATINGS, AVERAGING JUST 54,000 DAYTIME VIEWERS, TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, IF YOU LAID 54,000 PEOPLE END-TO-END THEY WOULD STILL RATHER DO THAT THAN WATCH FOX BUSINESS. STU IS KEEPING A STIFF UPPER FACE. HE KNOWS THAT THERE IS A BETTER MEASURE THAN RATINGS TO FIND OUT IF PEOPLE WATCH YOUR SHOW.
OKAY. SO I'M WALKING THE STREETS OF NEW YORK YESTERDAY, ACTUALLY I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE BUS SYSTEM WORKED. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY, ACTUALLY. I'M WALKING ALONG AND A YOUNG MAN COMING TOWARDS ME LOOKS AT ME VERY CLOSELY. HE IS NOT DRESSED LIKE A BANKER. FAR FROM IT. HE STICKS OUT HIS HAND. I THINK HE WANTS MONEY. INSTEAD HE SAYS LET ME SHAKE YOUR HAND. I STILL THINK HE WANTS MONEY BUT NO, HE WANTS ADVICE ON A STOCK. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. HE IS A VIEWER. YES! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SOMEONE WATCHES STU VARNEY, GUESS WHAT FOLKS, THAT MAN WAS NOT ALONE.
TEN YARDS DOWN THE STREET I'M BUYING MANGOS FROM A FRUIT STAND AND THE MAN SAYS HEY, YOU LOOK GREAT IN JEANS.
Stephen: YOU WANT RATINGS FOX BUSINESS EXECUTIVES, AMERICA DEMANDS MORE STU VARNEY BEDONKA DONK. AND THAT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THAT WAS NOT THE END OF STUIE'S DAY OUT.
THEN I GO PAST A BUS TOP, 30 PEOPLE IN LINE, ONE OF THEM STEPS OUT AND ASKS FOR A PICTURE. EVERYBODY ELSE TURNS TO STARE AT ME. THE MAN SAYS HE'S ON FOX, IT'S OKAY, THE BRITISH GUY, SURPRISE, SURPRISE, THERE WAS A GENERALLY POSITIVE RESPONSE. OH, I KNOW HIM.
Stephen: AND THOSE ARE SMART VIEWERS FOLKS, BECAUSE UNLIKE STU VARNEY THEY KNOW HOW THE BUS SYSTEM WORKS. (APPLAUSE) FOLKS-- I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I CAN REALLY IDENTIFY WITH VARNEY'S TALE OF BEING RECOGNIZED BY THE GREAT UNWASHED MASSES. WHY, JUST THIS PAST NIGHT I WAS PERAMBULATING ALONG THE BROADWAY WHEN I CAME TO THE SQUARE OF TIME AND WAS APPROACHED BY A YOUNG MAN. HE WAS NOT DRESSED AS A BANKER, OH NO. HE WAS COVERED IN RED FUR AND HE SAID HE WANTED HIS PICTURE WITH ME. AND THEN ASKED FOR $5, CLEARLY HE COULD SEE I WAS A SUCCESSFUL MAN OF BROADCASTING AND I MADE MY WAY TO THE DISTRICT FAMED FOR ITS PACKING OF MEATS WHERE I WAS IMMEDIATELY SET UPON BY SEVERAL EAGER YOUNG LADIES WHO WERE SUCH FANS THEY ASKED IF I NEEDED A DATE. ONE EVEN OFFERED ME A JOB IN SOME SORT OF HAND FACTORY, I BELIEVE. THE POINT IS--  (APPLAUSE) THE POINT IS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE POINT IS I DON'T KNOW HOW BUSES WORK. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
