STEPHEN:  WELCOME BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS SO MUCH! NATION, WE'RE IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF TELEVISION SHOWS ABOUT CAKE. YOU'VE GOT ACE OF CAKES, AMAZING WEDDING CAKES, FABULOUS CAKES, ULTIMATE CAKE-OFF, CAKE BOSS -- AND, OF COURSE, LAW AND ORDER: SPECIAL CAKE UNIT. (LAUGHTER) THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH CAKE IS IT'S STILL JUST CAKE. ALL IT CAN DO IS LOOK GOOD, TASTE DELICIOUS AND PROVIDE SUSTENANCE. WHY CAN'T IT PUT ON A SHOW LIKE THAT SINGING POPCORN THAT'S ALWAYS PROMISING TO MEET ME IN THE LOBBY BUT, WHEN I GET THERE, HE NEVER SHOWS UP? (LAUGHTER) LUCKILY, THE FOLKS AT DISNEY HAVE DONE BETTER THAN PUT ON SHOWS ABOUT CAKES.  THEY'RE PUTTING A SHOW ON WEDDING CAKES.
HERE AT DISNEY'S FAIRYTALE WEDDINGS, WE'RE KNOWN FOR STORYTELLING. JUST IMAGINE TELLING YOUR STORY ON YOUR CAKE AND BRINGING YOUR CAKE TO LIFE, WHETHER IT BE YOUR QUOTES OR IMAGES OR EVEN SOMETHING MEANINGFUL LIKE YOUR BEST STORY -- MAYBE IT'S A DISNEY STORY -- THAT'S ACTUALLY PROJECTED ONTO YOUR CAKE. DON'T WORRY, YOUR CAKE IS STILL EDIBLE.
STEPHEN:  YES, THE CAKE IS STILL EDIBLE. AS LONG AS YOU'RE OKAY WITH SOME TINKERBELL DROPPINGS. (LAUGHTER) WELL, COLOR ME ENCHANTED. DISNEY HAS IMAGINEERED A CAKE I CAN IMAGINE-EATING. AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT DISNEY BRAND CAN'T TURN INTO MAGIC -- WHETHER IT'S WEDDINGS, FAMILY VACATIONS OR EVEN BESTIALITY. (LAUGHTER) THIS ROMANTIC CAKE IS AVAILABLE EXCLUSIVELY AS PART OF THE DISNEY RESORTS FAIRYTALE WEDDINGS, WHICH COSTS A MINIMUM OF $12,000. THE MEMORIES WILL LAST A LIFETIME, ALONG WITH YOUR DEBT. BUT I KNOW MOST AMERICANS' BUDGET IS LESS CINDERELLA AND MORE CINDERELLA. SO FOR THE PRICE OF JUST $79.95, I AM PROUD TO OFFER STEPHEN COLBERT'S ENCHANTED PRINCESS PIXIE WEDDING CAKE -- FOR STRAIGHT COUPLES ONLY! IT FEATURES MY OWN ANIMATED STORYTELLING CAKE THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE THOSE EXPENSIVE AND HEAVILY TRADEMARKED DISNEY CHARACTERS. AND MY CAKE'S FROSTING IS DISTINCTIVE GREENSCREEN FROSTING ALLOWS US TO DIGITALLY INSERT MY CAVALCADE OF UNLICENSED CHARACTERS. THEY'RE NOT DISNEY, BUT THEY'RE DISNISH. (LAUGHTER) I KNOW EVERYBODY LOVES MICHAEL MOUSE! (WHISTLING) OH, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE WEDDING -- GROOM'S NAME -- AND -- BRIDE'S NAME...
Stephen: THANKS, MICHAEL. AND WAIT, WHO'S THAT COMING? IS IT THE LITTLE MERMAID? NO, IT'S TINY LOBSTER-GIRL DON'T WORRY, SHE MAY BE A SHELL FISH, BUT THE CAKE'S STILL KOSHER. AND IT WOULDN'T BE A WEDDING WITHOUT MICHAEL MOUSE'S FRIEND, A DOG-LIKE CREATURE NAMED "IDIOT." (LAUGHTER)
HU HU, I HIDE MY MEDS IN MY CHEEKS WHERE THE NURSE WON'T SEE! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND WHY LET YOUR FANTASY WEDDING STOP AT THE CAKE? IF YOU UPGRADE TO THE PREMIUM PRINCESS PACKAGE, WE'LL LET YOU MARRY WHOEVER YOU WANT. BECAUSE TAKING YOUR HAND IN MARRIAGE WILL BE ANDY SERKIS COVERED IN GREENSCREEN FROSTING. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
