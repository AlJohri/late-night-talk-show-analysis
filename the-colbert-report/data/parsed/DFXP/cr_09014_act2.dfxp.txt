Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. THANKS, FOLKS! NATION, THERE IS NO BIGGER FAN  OF THE SPORT OF CYCLING THAN  YOURS TRULY. (LAUGHTER)  I LOVE EVERY PART OF IT: THE  WHEELS, THE KICK STAND, THE  LITTLE BELL. OF COURSE, MY HERO IS SEVEN-TIME  TOUR DE FRANCE WINNER AND FRIEND  OF THE SHOW LANCE ARMSTRONG. A PIONEER IN THE SPORT HE WAS,  OF COURSE, THE FIRST MAN TO RIDE  HIS BIKE ON THE MOON. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S ONE SMALL PAIR OF SHORTS  FAR MAN, ONE GIANT BULGE FOR  MANKIND. (LAUGHTER)  OF COURSE, ALL THAT IS RUINED  NOW BECAUSE THE U.S. ANTI-DOPING  AGENCY IS ACCUSED ARMSTRONG OF LEADING A MASSIVE DOPING PROGRAM  THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE  COMING DOWN ON LANCE FOR DOPING! OF COURSE YOU NEED DRUGS TO  COMPETE IN A MULTIWEEK BICYCLE  RACE! YOU NEED DRUGS JUST TO WATCH  ONE! (LAUGHTER)  AND NOW MY FRIEND LANCE HAS  RECEIVED THE HARSHEST PUNISHMENT  IN THE HISTORY OF CYCLING.
CYCLING'S INTERNATIONAL  GOVERNING BODY STRIPPED LANCE  ARMSTRONG OF HIS SEVEN TOUR DE  FRANCE TITLES AND BANNED HIM FOR LIFE FROM THE SPORT.
Stephen: SO WHAT ARE THEY  GOING TO DO TO THE TITLES NOW,  GIVE THEM TO THE RUNNERS UP? OH, I'M SURE THEY WEREN'T  DOPING. THEY FINISHED SECOND BEHIND A  GUY WHO ROCKETED UP MOUNTAIN  SIDES WITH POWDERED MONKEY NUT  INJECTED INTO HIS HEART. (LAUGHTER)  YEAH, THESE GUYS ARE CLEAN, NO  DOUBT. SQUEAKY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT, FOLKS, LOSING HIS SEVEN  TITLES IS NOT THE WORST NEWS FOR  LANCE.
EXPERTS ESTIMATE LANCE  ARMSTRONG MIGHT LOSE UP TO $200  MILLION NOW THAT HIS BIG  SPONSORS HAVE DROPPED OUT-- NIKE RADIO SHACK, TREK.
Stephen: THAT'S $199,999,997  FROM NIKE AND TREK AND A PAIR OF  A.A.A. BATTERIES FROM RADIO  SHACK. (LAUGHTER)  NOW FOLKS, THIS SCANDAL HAS ALSO  AFFECTED LANCE'S CANCER CHARITY  LIVESTRONG KNOWN FOR THEIR YELLOW BRACELETS. SO LANCE IS DOING THE RIGHT  THING.
LANCE ARMSTRONG IS STEPPING  DOWN AS CHAIRMAN OF HIS  LIVESTRONG CANCER-FIGHTING  CHARITY. HE SAYS HE WANTS TO STEP DOWN AS  A RESULT TO LIMIT THE DAMAGE  FROM THE DOPING SCANDAL  INVOLVING HIM.
HE HAD NO CHOICE. EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES NOW IS  TAINTED AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO  SOIL THE GOOD NAME OF CANCER. (LAUGHTER)  SO HE'S DISTANCING HIMSELF --  (LAUGHTER)  HE'S GOT TO DO IT. SO HE'S DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM  THE ORGANIZATION BY STEPPING  DOWN AS CHAIRMAN AND MERELY  REMAINING ON THE BOARD AS, YOU KNOW, I WAS SO INSPIRED BY LANCE  ARM STRONG'S LIVE STRONG THAT I  STARTED MY OWN RUBBER BRACELET  CHARITY WRISTRONG TO RAISE AWARENESS OF WRIST---  WRIST-RELATED INJURIES. ALL TOO COMMON. IT'S GLORIFIED BY HOLLYWOOD. GLORIFIED. BY THE WAY -- RIGHT HERE, FOLKS. BY THE WAY, YOU CAN STILL  PURCHASE WRISTRONG BRONG  BRACELETS AT colbertnation.com,  ALL PROCEEDS GO TO THE YELLOW RIBBON FUND THAT SUPPORTS THE  FAMILIES OF WOUNDED TROOPS AT  WALTER REED AND THE FORT BELVOIR  COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. AND, FOLKS --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, IT PAINS ME TO SAY THIS  BUT, LIKE LANCE, THERE'S ALSO A  SCANDAL SURROUNDING ME AND MY  CHARITY. IN THE SAME WAY THAT LANCE WON  SEVEN CONSECUTIVE TOUR DE FRANCE  I HAVE WON MY SHOW FOR SEVEN  CONSECUTIVE YEARS. (LAUGHTER)  UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF  "THE COLBERT REPORT."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SADLY, SADLY THESE REPEATED VICTORIES HAVE LED TO  ACCUSATIONS THAT ANYBODY SHOWING  THIS MUCH SACK FOR THAT LONG  MUST BE BALL DOPING. AND, FOLKS, FRANKLY, I'VE JUST  GROWN WEARY OF THESE CHARGES. ARE MY BALLS BIG? YES. WHEN I FLY DO I NEED TO BUY TWO  EXTRA SEATS? SURE. BUT IT'S ALL NATURAL. SO YOU MAY ASK STEVEN, WHY  AREN'T YOU FIGHTING THESE  CHARGES? BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO DRAG  AMERICA THROUGH MY BALL SCANDAL! (LAUGHTER)  OR SCANDALIZE AMERICA BY  DRAGGING MY BALLS THROUGH IT! IT'S A REAL PROBLEM. THAT'S WHY I DON'T WEAR  WIDE-LEGGED PANTS. OR RIDE ESCALATORS ANYMORE. THAT IS ALSO WHY -- TRUE. DANGEROUS. THAT IS ALSO WHY EFFECTIVE TODAY  I AM STEPPING DOWN AS CHAIRMAN  OF THE WRISTRONG FOUNDATION. (BOOS)  I HAVE TO DO THIS. I HAVE TO DO THIS. WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN BUT I TRUST MY  BALLS WILL ALSO BE STEPPING  DOWN. OR AT LEAST DESCENDING. THERE IT IS. AND THOUGH I WILL NO LONGER BE  CHAIRMAN, I WILL BE STAYING ON  THE BOARD WHICH HAS NO OTHER  MEMBERS BUT ME. SO I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT  STARTING TODAY I WILL BE SERVING  AS INTERIM CHAIRMAN OF THE  WRISTRONG FOUNDATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW, FOLKS -- NOW, FOLKS, --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE SAYING WILL THIS  SCANDAL FOLLOW ME? YES, THE SAME WAY MY BALLS  FOLLOW ME IN A MOTORIZED SIDE  CAR I USE ON THE WEEKENDS. I'M TIRED. (LAUGHTER)  AS IT IS ALL THE TITLES I HAVE  LEARNED IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS,  THE REVEREND SIR DR. STEPHEN T. MOS DEF HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF  THE WORLD I WILL RETAIN BUT THEY  WILL NOW HAVE TO ADD AN ASTERISK  YOU KNOW WHAT, MAKE THAT TWO. NO, JIMMY, MAKE THEM BIGGER. THERE YOU GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
