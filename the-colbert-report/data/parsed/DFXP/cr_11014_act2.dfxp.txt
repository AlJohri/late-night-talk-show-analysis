(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, IF YOU KNOW ME, YOU KNOW I LOVE SPORT. I ALSO LOVE PRETENDING THAT I LOVE THINGS THAT I DON'T. THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT! FOLKS, IT'S NO SECRET THE N.F.L. HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY CONTROVERSY. THERE ARE GROWING CONCERNS OVER THE SAFETY OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS, AS WELL AS THE SAFETY OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW FOOTBALL PLAYERS. SO I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR ABOUT A NEW ALTERNATIVE TO FOOTBALL -- MORE FOOTBALL.
FXFL IS HERE. THREE MAJOR CITIES, NEW YORK, BOSTON, OMAHA. AS SOME OF THE BEST TALENT IN THE COUNTRY IS ON CENTER STAGE, LOOKING TO KEEP THEIR PRO FOOTBALL DREAMS ALIVE.
YOUR HEART BEATS TOGETHER AS ONE!
WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE GAME.
Stephen: YES, THE FXFL, WHICH STANDS FOR "FALL EXPERIMENTAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE," AND IT'S COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF PLAYERS RELEASED DURING OR AFTER THE N.F.L. PRE-SEASON. PERFECT! HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU WATCHED A COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME AND SAID, I WISH THE PLAYERS WERE BETTER. THEN WATCHED AN N.F.L. GAME AND SAID, NO, NOT THIS GOOD. SWEET SPOT. THE FXFL HAS FOUR TEAMS, THE OMAHA MAMMOTHS, THE BROOKLYN BOLTS, THE BOSTON BRAWLERS, AND IF YOU DON'T LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE CITIES, YOU CAN ROOT FOR THE BLACKTIPS... BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A HOME CITY AND ARE, INSTEAD, "A ROVING ALL-STAR TEAM THAT WILL PLAY ALL ITS GAMES ON THE ROAD." THEY'RE SORT OF LIKE THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS, EXCEPT THE GLOBETROTTERS ARE BETTER AT FOOTBALL. AND THE FXFL WILL PROVIDE A VIABLE PLATFORM FOR MARGINAL PLAYERS TO RECEIVE LIVE TRAINING, ULTIMATELY GIVING THE N.F.L. TEAMS BETTER-PREPARED IN-SEASON ROSTER REPLACEMENTS. AND THE LEAGUE HOPES THAT 25 TO 30% OF FXFL PLAYERS RETURN TO THE N.F.L. THIS FALL. GREAT SELLING POINT. WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO WATCH A SPORT WHERE, WEEK BY WEEK, ALL THE GOOD PLAYERS LEAVE? AND THE COMPETITION WILL BE FIERCE BECAUSE THE SEASON'S ONLY SIX WEEKS, WITH GAMES ON WEDNESDAY NIGHTS. WHICH IS PERFECT AGAIN BECAUSE WEDNESDAY IS THE NIGHT I START THE PROCESS OF LOOKING INSIDE MYSELF AND TRY TO HONESTLY ASCERTAIN MY READINESS FOR SOME FOOTBALL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, NATION -- ANOTHER NEW FOOTBALL LEAGUE? WE'VE ALREADY HAD THE USFL, THE UFL, THE NFL EUROPE AND THE XFL. AND ALL OF THOSE LEAGUES FAILED, BUT THE FXFL WILL BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ADDED AN "F," THE LETTER SYNONYMOUS WITH SUCCESS! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
