TELEVISION HOST STEPHEN COLBERT  HAS ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION  FROM "THE COLBERT REPORT" EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE, FOLKS, I AM STINKING  FILTHY RICH! (LAUGHTER)  JIMMY, TELL THEM WHY!
POWER BAVL SALES ARE  SKYROCKETING, UPPING BOTH THE  JACKPOT AND THE ODDS THAT SOMEBODY WILL ACTUALLY WIN THE  BIG PRIZE TONIGHT. IT SITS AT $550 MILLION.

Stephen: NOW -- (LAUGHS)  WHOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW I KNOW THAT LOTTO MONEY IS  GOING TO BE MINE, OKAY? EVEN THOUGH THE DRAWING HASN'T  HAPPENED YET, EVEN THOUGH THE  ODDS OF WINNING ARE 175 MILLION TO ONE. BECAUSE I BOUGHT 175 MILLION  TICKETS. (LAUGHTER)  AND I'M GUARANTEED TO WIN,  BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF  THESE BABIES HAS THE EXACT SAME LUCKY NUMBERS. (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT? SO IT'S IN THE BANK. I AM MEGARICH! NO MORE SLAVING AWAY FOR THE MAN  30 MINUTES A DAY FOUR DAYS A  WEEK. (LAUGHTER)  LOOK, IT'S BEEN A GREAT RUN,  IT'S BEEN FUN, BUT LET'S FACE IT  I'M NOT DOING THIS SHOW FOR MY  HEALTH! JUST LOOK AT ANY PICTURE OF ME  FROM SEVEN YEARS AGO. (LAUGHTER)  NOW I CAN AFFORD TO BUILD A TIME  MACHINE AND GO BACK AND WARN  THAT GUY NOT TO DO THIS SHOW! WE'RE DYING! (LAUGHTER)  ANYWAY, CALL YOUR FRIENDS  BECAUSE THE PARTAY IS GOING TO  BE BUMPING IN MY NEW MANSION! WE'VE GOT TWO POOLS: ONE SHAPED  LIKE THE SQUIRREL FROM "ICE AGE  2" ONE SHAPED LIKE THE SQUIRREL FROM "ICE AGE 3."  (LAUGHTER)  I GOT A BASKETBALL COURT IN  EVERY ROOM. WEEKENDS I PAY YAO MING TO GO  ONE ON ONE AGAINST MING THE  MERCILESS. MING ON MING! AND I'M NEVER GOING TO BE LONELY  AGAIN BECAUSE MY HOUSE IS FILLED  WITH COUSINS I'VE NEVER HEARD OF WHO NEED MONEY. OF COURSE THEY'RE FAMILY, I WANT  THEM GET BACK ON THEIR FEET  AFTER THEIR RELEASE. (LAUGHTER)  AND THE DRUGS, OH, PRIMO  URUGUAYIAN ELECTRIC POP ROCK. (LAUGHTER)  OF COURSE, ALL THOSE DRUGS MAKE  ME PARANOID THAT THOSE FRIENDS  WHO KEEP SHOWING UP DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT ME, JUST ABOUT MY  SQUIRREL POOL. (LAUGHTER)  SO I'LL START GAMBLING, PLAYING  THE PONIES. AND NOT JUST UPCOMING RACES BUT  ALSO PAST RACES. OH, GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE I LOST  $320 20-MILLION ON THE 1982  BELMONT STAKES! CURSE YOU, CRYSTAL SINS! (LAUGHTER)  NOW THE MONEY'S DRYING UP,  PEOPLE DON'T COME AROUND  ANYMORE. MY WIFE AND MY KIDS DON'T  RECOGNIZE ME BECAUSE I PAID  COSMETIC SURGEONS TO MAKE ME LOOK LIKE AN OLSON TWIN. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SO MY FAMILY WALKS OUT ON ME. BUT THAT'S OKAY, I GOT THAT NEW  GIRLFRIEND, CINNAMON. AND SHE LOVES ME FOR ME, MONEY. (LAUGHTER)  AND SHE LEAVES ME FOR MING THE  MERCILESS! HOW COULD YOU DO ME LIKE, THAT  MING? BROS BEFORE HOS! OH, MY GOD, HOW HAS MY LIFE COME  TO THIS? I WISH I'D NEVER WON THE LOTTO. (LAUGHTER)  I DIDN'T WIN. OH. OH, GOD, THANK GOD. OKAY, BACK TO THE SALT MINE. (LAUGHTER)  FROM NOW ON, NO MORE STUPID  GAMBLES, I'M GOING TO KEEP MY  MONEY SAFE IN THE STOCK MARKET. (LAUGHTER)  NATION --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NATION, THERE IS A WAR ON  TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IN THIS COUNTRY DID YOU KNOW MANY OF  THOSE BRIDES AND GROOMS ON THE  TOP OF WEDDING CAKES AREN'T LEGALLY MARRIED? YOU'RE FROSTING IN SIN! NOW THE THREAT TO TRADITIONAL  MARRIAGE IS COMING FROM INSIDE  THE COUPLE.
THE IMPORTANCE OF MARRIAGE  AMONG WOMEN ROSE 9 PERCENTAGE  POINT FROM 1997 FROM 28% TO 37%. BUT THOSE WOMEN AREN'T FINDING  MEN TO MARRY. APPARENTLY BECAUSE MEN ARE LESS  INTERESTED, DROPPING FROM 35% TO  29%.
Stephen: SHOCKING! WOMEN WANT TO GET MARRIED MORE  THAN MEN DO. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S FROM THE SAME RESEARCHERS  WHO FOUND THAT WOMEN TEN TO  SCRATCH THEIR BALLS LESS THAN  MEN. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  TRUE. SHOCKING. ARE THESE CHILLING MARRIAGE  STATISTICS MEAN THERE ARE  MILLIONS OF WOMEN WHO MAY NEVER WALK DOWN THE AISLE, AND THAT  BRINGS US TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SISTERS ARE DOING IT TO  THEMSELVES. FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO MATTERS  OF THE WOMAN, I ALWAYS TURN TO  ONE SOURCE:. I TURN TO FOX NEWS.
THEIR WEB SITE RECENTLY  ADDRESSED WHY SO MANY WOMEN  CAN'T GET MARRIED. ACCORDING TO FOX CONTRIBUTORS,  IT'S ALL PART OF THE WAR ON MEN. SHE WRITES "I'VE ACCIDENTALLY  STUMBLED UPON A SUBCULTURE OF  MEN WHO'VE TOLD ME THEY'RE NEVER GETTING MARRIED. WHEN I ASK THEM WHY THE ANSWER  IS ALWAYS THE SAME: WOMEN AREN'T  WOMEN ANYMORE." RIGHT, WOMEN AREN'T WOMEN  ANYMORE! THAT'S WHY, FELLAS, ALWAYS LOOK  FOR THE ADAMS APPLE, OKAY? (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S A PRO TIP. THEN LOOK FOR THE ADAM'S WE US  IN. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,  FOOL ME ONCE. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, FOLKS, THIS HARD TRUTH HAS  BEEN ATTACKED IN THE MAINSTREAM  MEDIA. IT EVIDENTLY RUFFLED A LOT OF  LADY FEATHERS. AT LEAST I THINK THEY HAVE  FEATHERS, I'M NOT SURE. I A LOT OF THEM PLUCK THESE  DAYS. OF COURSE, THIS THIN-SKINNED  REACTION WON'T SURPRISE BANKER. IN THE ARTICLE, SHE WROTE THAT  "WHAT IF THE DERTH OF GOOD MEN  IS WOMEN'S FAULT? SINCE THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION, MEN  HAVEN'T CHANGED MUCH BUT WOMEN  HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. IN A NUTSHELL, WOMEN ARE ANGRY,  THEY'RE ALSO DEFENSIVE."  WOMEN ARE ANGRY AND DEFENSIVE. YOU NEED PROOF? GO UP TO ANY SINGLE WOMAN AND  SAY "THE REASON YOU'RE NOT  MARRIED IS BECAUSE YOU'RE ANGRY AND DEFENSIVE."  (LAUGHTER)  AND NOT ONLY --  (APPLAUSE)  NOT ONLY ARE TODAY'S SHRILL HAARPYS SCARING GOOD QUALITY MEN  AWAY FROM MARRIAGE, BUT ALSO  MAKING THESE MEN DEADBEATS! BANKER SAYS THE RISE OF WOMEN  HAS PISSED MEN OFF AND  UNDERUNDERMINEDED MEN'S ABILITY IN THE HOPES OF SOMEDAY  SUPPORTING A FAMILY. MEN WANT TO LOVE WOMEN, NOT  COMPETE WITH THEM! YEAH, MEN HATE WOMEN WHO COMPETE  WITH THEM! THAT'S WHY IT'S SO RARE FOR MEN  TO BE ATTRACTED TO WOMEN IN THE  WORKPLACE. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN, WHAT MAN WANTS A WOMAN  PROVIDING THE MONEY WHILE HE  STAYS HOME TO DO WHAT? WITNESS HIS CHILD TAKING ITS  FIRST STEPS? I MEAN, PEOPLE BEFORE AND,  FRANKLY, BABIES AREN'T THAT GOOD  AT IT. (LAUGHTER)  MEN WANT PAPERWORK! WE WANT A GRINDING COMMUTE TO  SIT IN THE CUBE = ALL DAY LONG  TAKING CRAP FROM FROM FROM THAT JERKOFF RICK! (LAUGHTER)  LUCKILY BANKER SEES A WAY TO  LIBERATE WOMEN AND MEN FROM  THESE LIBERATED WOMEN. ALL THE LADIES HAVE TO DO IS  "SURRENDER TO THEIR NATURE,  THEIR FEMININITY, AND LET MEN SURRENDER TO THEIRS. IF THEY DO, MARRIAGEABLE MEN  WILL COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK."  YES, JUST SURRENDER AND THOSE MEN WILL COME OUT OF THE  WOODWORK LIKE COCKROACHES IN A  DARKENED CRAB SHACK. (LAUGHTER)  BUT LADIES, LADIES, YOU CAN DO  MORE BY DOING LESS. MAYBE STOP VOTING OR STOP  TALKING. I MEAN IS, WHAT ARE YOU GIRLS  THINKING? I MEAN, FOLLOW MISS BANKER'S  ADVICE AND YOU SINGLE GALS WILL  FINALLY BE ABLE TO LIVE OUT EVERY WOMAN'S WILDEST DREAM:  MARRYING A MAN WHO DOESN'T WANT  YOU TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING. AND AS A MAN ON BEHALF OF WOMEN  EVERYWHERE, THANK YOU, SUSAN  BANKER. I TRUST YOU WILL LEAD THE CHARGE  BY GETTING OUT OF THE WRITING  BUSINESS CLEARLY IT'S NOT IN YOUR NATURE. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BAC
