(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH! NATION, NATION THE NEWS RIGHT NOW, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THE NEWS RIGHT NOW IS A LITTLE DEPRESSING, BUT WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH, AMERICA'S SMALL TOWNS SHOW US HOW FOLKS MAKE DO WITH WHAT THEY'VE GOT. THIS IS HOMETOWN HEROTOWN. (TRUMPET SOUND) TONIGHT'S TINY TOWN THAT COULD -- DETROIT. MOTOWN HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES LATELY --  RIGHT NOW, DETROIT IS MIRED IN THE LARGEST MUNICIPAL BANKRUPTCY IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE CITY MANAGER ESTIMATES THE TOTAL DEBT IS LIKELY TO BE BETWEEN $18 BILLION AND $20 BILLION. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT FIGURE IS A LITTLE VAGUE, BUT THE REPO-MEN TOOK THE CITY'S CALCULATOR. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW THAT WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, THE HOMETOWN GETS HERO, AND NOBODY KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN DETROIT'S FIRE DEPARTMENT WHICH, CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, DOES NOT START FIRES. (LAUGHTER) THESE HARD WORKING MIDDLE-AMERICANS TURNED THEIR LACK-OF-LEMONS INTO A LACK-OF-LEMONADE. JIM?
DETROIT GETS ABOUT 11,000 FIRES IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. BUT HOW IT GETS THOSE CALLS MAY SURPRISE YOU. THE CITY HAS NO MODERN-DAY COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM FOR GETTING EMERGENCY ALERT. IN FIRE STATIONS ALL ACROSS DETROIT, FIREFIGHTERS PLACE A POP CAN FILLED WITH COINS OR SCREWS ON TOP OF A FAX MACHINE. WHEN AN EMERGENCY ALERT COMES THROUGH, THE PAPER KNOCKS DOWN THE POP CAN, THE CLANKING NOISE MEANS THERE'S AN EMERGENCY.
WHEN A RUN COMES OVER THE PRINTER, IT COMES OUT, HITS OUR FAYGO CAN. (CLANKS) AND WE GET AN ALERT.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THE ALARM AT MANY -- YES, GIVE IT UP! GIVE IT UP! (APPLAUSE) CAN DO! THAT'S RIGHT, THE ALARM AT MANY DETROIT FIRE STATIONS IS A FAYGO CAN FULL OF SCREWS -- WHICH IS, INCIDENTALLY, THE HEALTHIEST FLAVOR OF FAYGO. (LAUGHTER) WELL DONE, THRIFTY DETROIT FIREFIGHTERS, FOR SHOWING YOU DON'T NEED THE BELLS AND WHISTLES OF ACTUAL BELLS OR WHISTLES. (LAUGHTER) THIS WOBBLY CAN SYSTEM IS FOOLPROOF, PROVIDED NO ONE EVER BUMPS THE TABLE. AND THIS SECURITY INNOVATION IS NO SURPRISE. AFTER ALL, DETROIT IS THE TOWN THAT BROUGHT US ROBO COP, WHICH, WITH TODAY'S BUDGET, LOOKS MORE LIKE THIS.
DEAD OR ALIVE, YOU'RE COMING WITH ME! DROP IT!
Stephen: FOLKS, WHEN I SEE THIS JERRY-RIGGED ALARM SYSTEM, IT'S CLEAR THAT THESE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN DESERVE MORE... CHANCES TO MAKE DO WITH LESS. I MEAN, THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF FAT TO BE TRIMMED HERE. FOR EXAMPLE, RIGHT NOW EMERGENCY CALLS GO TO A CENTRAL DISPATCHER WHO THEN FAXES IT TO THE FIRE STATIONS. WHY BOTHER WITH DISPATCHERS WHEN HOMEOWNERS CAN FAX THE STATION DIRECTLY? IF THERE'S A FIRE, JUST REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING -- STOP, DROP AND ROLL -- OVER TO YOUR CANON L.C. 2050 LASER-CLASS FAX MACHINE, THEN LOAD THE PAPER TRAY, PLACE YOUR DOCUMENT TEXT-SIDE DOWN INTO THE FEEDER, DIAL YOUR LOCAL FIRE STATION AND HIT "SEND." OH! AND MAKE SURE YOU ADD A COVER LETTER WITH THE SUBJECT HEADER "FIRE!" (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) SO BRAVO, BRAVO TO DETROIT'S FIREFIGHTERS WHO SOLVED THEIR LACK OF AN ALARM WITH THEIR CAN-DO SPIRIT -- BY SAYING "LET'S HAVE A CAN-DO IT." (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
