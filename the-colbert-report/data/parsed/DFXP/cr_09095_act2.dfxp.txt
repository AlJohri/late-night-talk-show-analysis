( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HIP HOP  DUO BEHIND THE SIT SONG THRIFT  SHOP WHICH IS THE SAME PLACE... PLEASE WELCOME McLEMORE AND  RYAN LEWIS. THANK YOU.
HOW ARE YOU DOING. Stephen: RYAN, THANKS FOR  COMING, MAN. VERY EXCITED HERE. VERY EXCITED. McLEMORE, CAN I CALL YOU BEN?
SURE. tephen: BEN HAGGERTY, RYAN  LEWIS. VERY FORMAL HERE. THANK YOU FOR WEARING YOUR  FORMAL T-SHIRT.
YOU'RE WELCOME. Stephen: GUYS, WHILE I'M A  FAN, I'VE GOT A BEEF WITH YOU.
LAY IT OUT. Stephen: YOU RELEASED YOUR  ALBUM INDEPENDENTLY, OKAY. PRODUCED YOURSELF. RELEASED IT INDEPENDENTLY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOES TO  CORPORATIONS WHEN THEY DO NOT  GET THE MAJORITY OF THE CASH FROM SALES? IT IS SHOW BIZ, OKAY. NOT SHOW "HAVE FUN AND MAKE  MUSIC."  WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
FOR THOSE EXACT REASONS. IT'S IN OUR CONTROL. IT'S IN OUR CREATIVE DIRECTION. WE GET TO PICK WHAT WE DO. WE GET TO PICK WHAT WE MAKE. WE GET TO MARKET IT HOW WE WANT  TO MARKET IT. IT'S OUR BRAND. WE GET MORE MONEY AT THE END OF  THE DAY.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO  SELL OUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). OKAY. SO IT'S ABOUT NOT SELLING OUT. BUT YOU DID HIRE PART OF THE  WARNER GROUP TO GET YOU GUYS ON  THE RADIO, RIGHT?
WE DID. Stephen: YOU DIDN'T SELL IT. YOU RENTED IT OUT.
RENTED. Stephen: IS THAT A NEW MODEL? YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK THAT'S A MODEL THAT HAS  REALLY NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. AND I THINK IT IS A TESTAMENT TO  THE DIRECTION THAT MAJOR LABELS  SHOULD BE GOING WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, IF AURA COMPLETELY  INDEPENDENT ARTIST, TO BE ABLE  TO TAKE A CRACK AT RADIO AND NOT BE SIGNING A DEAL, NOT BE  SIGNING A 360 DEAL. AND HAVE ACCESS TO RADIO. IF YOU HAVE A SONG THAT YOU  THINK WORKS FOR IT. FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME ON NO  CONTRACT AND REALLY THAT'S ALL  THAT LABELS HAVE LEFT IS A CONNECTION TO RADIO.
Stephen: THEY'RE CLICKING ON  THE YOU-TUBE. THAT'S LIKE 250 MILLION HITS ON  THRIFT SHOP. IS EVERY KID NOW INSTEAD OF THE  TOP 40, IS EVER KID CLICKING  THEIR OWN RYAN SEACREST MAKING THEIR OWN TOP 40 LIKE CASEY  CASSOM.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO CASEY  CASSOM IS.
Stephen: HE'S FOR YOUNG GUYS  LIKE ME. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHO THAT WAS. LET'S TALK TURKEY HERE. CAN WE TALK TURKEY? McLEMORE. McLEMORE. RYAN LEWIS. DID YOU EVER GET PISSED OFF? THIS GUY IS IN THE SPOTLIGHT. NOW IS YOUR TIME TO SHINE. DOES THAT EVER PISS YOU OFF?
I THINK THAT THERE WAS A  PERIOD, YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU GO  IN AND OUT OF, OF COURSE, WANTING TO BE THE LEAD SINGER  YOURSELF. AT THIS POINT NOW THAT I HAVE A  VERY GOOD SCOPE TO WHAT BEING A  CELEBBITY IS, I THINK I'M HAPPY BEING IN THE BACKGROUND.
Stephen: THAT'S TOUGH. IT MAKES FOR AATE LOW MORE  SUNGLASSES AND... FOR A LOT MORE  SUNGLASSES AND BALL CAPS AND FAKE WIGS.
Stephen: I KNOW THE FEELING. I'LL BE LIKE AT THE PLANT STORE  GETTING SOME MULCH. ONE OF THE YOUNG GUYS WILL SAY  AREN'T YOU THAT GUY WHO USED TO  WORK FOR JON STEWART? AND I'M LIKE PLEASE LEAVE ME  ALONE.   ( APPLAUSE )   YOU DO SONGS THAT ARE A LITTLE  BIT UNUSUAL FOR HIP HOP LIKE THE  SONG YOU'RE DOING TONIGHT IS IN FAVOR OR IN SUPPORT OF GAY  MARRIAGE.
YES  Stephen: THAT'S NOT... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S NOT THE MOST  COMMON THING TO BE HIP HOPPING  ABOUT. MY FRIEND SNOOP, A FRIEND OF THE  SHOW, SAID THAT LIKE  HOMOSEXUALITY AND HIP HOP MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO GHETTOING. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?
WAS HE ON WEED WHEN HE SAID  IT?
Stephen: HE WAS ALIVE. I THINK THAT IN THE LAST YEAR  ALONE, HIP HOP HAS MADE GREAT  STRIDES IN TERMS OF BEING MORE OPEN MINDED. IT IS AN ART FORM  STEREOTYPICALLY IN THE PAST THAT  HAS BEEN VERY HOMOPHOBIC, VERY MASK LYNN DRIVEN CULTURE. A LOT OF MISS OJ KNEE A LOT OF  HOMOPHOBIA IN THE LAST YEAR OF  PEOPLE'S MINDS HAVE STARTED TO OPEN UP. YOU HAVE BARACK OBAMA IN SUPPORT  OF GAY MARRIAGE.
Stephen: I'M NOT FAMILIAR  WITH BARACK OBAMA'S RAP WORDS. BUT I'M SURE IT'S VERY GOOD.
BARACK OBAMA, IF YOU LISTEN  FAINTLY, YOU CAN HEAR FAINT RAP  MUSIC COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ON SUNDAY NIGHTS I'VE  HEARD
Stephen: FULL RAP USED TO SAY  THINGS LIKE [BLEEP] POLICE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO TO THE  POLICE? RYAN?
I'D WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH  THE POLICE.
Stephen: WELL, I'LL TELL YOU  WHAT. WOULD YOU DO A SONG FOR US NOW  THAT YOU'RE ALL SET UP? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING  HERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A  PERFORMANCE BY MACLEMORE AND  RYAN LEWIS. STICK AROUND.
