Stephen: TONIGHT AN HISTORIC  GAY MARRIAGE DECISION. MICHAEL AND STEWART DECIDED ON A  SWING BAND. THEN IS DISCRIMINATION OVER IN  AMERICA? I'LL TELL YOU IF YOU'RE NOT  MEXICAN. AND MY GUEST, LEGENDARY NEWSMAN  BILL MOYERS, HAS A NEW  DOCUMENTARY ABOUT AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS. OH, I LOVE GHOST STORIES. SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND A WAY FOR  PARALYZED RATS TO REGAIN THE  ABILITY TO URINATE. FINALLY A SOLUTION TO THE  WORLD'S DEFICIT OF RAT URINE. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN! tephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TONIGHT,  OF COURSE, WE ARE BROADCASTING  LIVE FROM THE ALTERNATIVE STUDIO I HAVE MOUNTED ON THE BELLY OF A  DIRIGIBLE SAILING HIGH OVER  INTERNATIONAL WATERS ALL TO PROTECT US FROM THE HOT, SWEATY  MASS OF MAN MEAT THAT IS NO  DOUBT WRITHING OVER THE FACE OF OUR ONCE GREAT NATION. JIMMY, TELL 'EM WHY.
WE BEGIN WITH THIS BREAKING  NEWS FROM THE SUPREME COURT. DOMA, THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE  ACT, RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
DOMA A LAW THAT'S BEEN ON THE  BOOKS FOR 17 YEARS HAS BEEN  STRUCK DOWN IN A 5-4 RULING WHICH MEANS COUPLES MARRIED IN  ONE OF THE STATES WHERE SAME-SEX  MARRIAGE IS LEGAL WILL HAVE THE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS TO ARE  CURRENTLY PROVIDED TO  OPPOSITE-SEX MARRIED COUPLES UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW.
THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT  IS FINALLY DEAD AND GONE.
Stephen: THE DEFENSE OF  MARRIAGE ACT IS DEAD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TRADITIONAL... LIKE MY AUDIENCE,  I CLAP WHEN I'M AFRAID. TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS NOW AS  DEFENSELESS AS A FRESHMAN FRAT  PLEDGE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH THE SPANKING MACHINE. SO STRAIGHT MARRIED PEOPLE,  LISTEN UP. IF A GAY CHARGES YOUR MARRIAGE  YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO PUFF  YOURSELF UP, MAKE YOURSELF SEEM BIGGER, TRY TO FRIGHTEN IT OFF  BY TALKING IN A FIRM, LOUD VOICE  ABOUT PLEATED DENIM OR JIMMY  BUFFET. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. IT WILL SCARE 'EM OFF. FOLKS, I FOR ONE CANNOT BELIEVE  THE COURT THREW OUT DOMA. IT WAS PASSED IN 1996 TO  GUARANTEE THAT TRADITIONAL  MARRIAGE WAS BETWEEN ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN FOR THE SACRED PURPOSE  OF GETTING BILL CLINTON  RE-ELECTED. LISTEN, FOLKS, TO THEIR  SO-CALLED JUDICIAL REASONING.
DOMA IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS A  DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY OF  PERSONS THAT IS PROTECTED UNDER THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. OH, PLEASE. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT  THERE ARE AMENDMENTS AFTER THE  SECOND. SOUNDS MADE UP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT  THIS MEANS. IF DOMA IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL,  THAT MEANS THE CONSTITUTION IS  GAY. OF COURSE, I MEAN, NO REAL  SHOCKER. IT WAS WRITTEN BY A BUNCH OF  DUDES IN WIGS AND TIGHTS IN THE  CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE. AND IT CALLS FOR A LEGISLATURE  THAT IS BI-CAP RAL? THAT'S A BIT CURIOUS. PLUS LOOK AT THAT AGED PARCHMENT  AND FANCY CALLIGRAPHY. LOOKS LIKE A GAY WEDDING  INVITATION. ON THE BACK, I BET IT ASKS YOU  TO CHECK SALMON OR VEGAN PAELLA. THAT COULD BE NATIONAL TREASURE  3. CALL ME, NICK CAGE. WORST OF ALL, FOLKS, IN SETTLING  THIS GAY MARRIAGE CONTROVERSY,  THEY IN FACT SETTLED NOTHING.
THE THING ABOUT STRIKING DOWN  DOMA IS IT DOESN'T AFFECT ANY  STATE'S RIGHT TO BAN OR TO ALLOW SAME SEX MARRIAGE.
WE HAVE MARRIAGE RIGHTS IN  CALIFORNIA. WE'VE GOT MARRIAGE RIGHTS  OVERALL IN 12 STATES AND WE'VE  GOT FEDERAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS BUT WE STILL HAVE UNEQUAL  RECOGNITION OF MARRIAGES IN 38  OTHER STATES SO WE DO HAVE A VERY INTERESTING PATCHWORK  SYSTEM.
Stephen: THE SUPREMES REALLY  SCREWED THE POOCH HERE WHICH I'M  SURE IS ALSO LEGAL NOW. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. YOU'RE MARRIED IN NEW YORK. YOU'RE NOT MARRIED IN ALABAMA. WHAT GIVES? I'M AS CONFUSED AS A FRESHMAN  FRAT PLEDGE WHO REALLY ENJOYED  THAT SPANKING MACHINE. AND FOLKS, I AM TAKING THE  DECISION ON DOMA EXTRA HARD HERE  BECAUSE I WAS IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD AFTER YESTERDAY'S GREAT  DECISION.
TODAY THE SUPREME COURT  ESSENTIALLY KNOCKED DOWN ONE OF  THE PILLARS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT: IT INVALIDATED A KEY  PART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT,  THE LAW ENACTD IN 1965 TO STOP RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AT THE  POLLS.
AT ISSUE WAS A PROVISION IN  THE ACT THAT SINGLED OUT STATES  WITH A HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION AND VOTING MOSTLY IN THE SOUTH  AND REQUIRED THEM TO GET  PRECLEARANCE, APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEFORE  CHANGING VOTING PROCEDURES.
Stephen: LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, AS A SON OF THE SOUTH  FROM ONE OF THE STATES COVERED BY THE PRECLEARANCE PROVISION OF  THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT I WANT TO  THANK THE SUPREME COURT FOR FINALLY SETTING MY PEOPLE FREE. IT WAS A 5-4 DECISION WITH CHIEF  JUSTICE ROBERTS JOINED BY  JUSTICES SCALIA, THOMAS, ALITO AND DEEN. NOW, EVERYBODY IS BETTER WITH  BUTTER. NOW, FOLKS, IN HIS DECISION  GUTTING THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT,  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS SAGELY NOTED SOMETHING MANY OF US HAD  APPARENTLY MISSED ABOUT  DISCRIMINATION SAYING, QUOTE, NEARLY FIST YEARS LATER THINGS  HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. TRUE. FOR INSTANCE, THERE USED TO BE A  VOTING RIGHTS ACT. BUT WE DON'T NEED IT NOW BECAUSE  APPARENTLY RACISM IS OVER. NOW I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT AND  NO ONE CAN CALL IT RACIST. HIT IT, JIMMY. OLD MAN RIBBER, DAT OLD MAN  RIBBER ♪♪  ♪ HE MUST KNOW SUMTIN', BUT  DON'T SAY NOTTIN ' ♪♪
Stephen: TECHNICAL  DIFFICULTIES? JIMMY, CAN WE GET AN ASIAN ON  THAT, PLEASE. OF COURSE, FOLKS, NOT EVERYONE  IS READY TO EMBRACE JOHN ROBERTS  THE POST RACIAL UTOPIA LIKE MEAN OLD LADY GINSBURG WHO WROTE IN  HER HISSY FIT THROWING OUT  PRECLEARANCE WHEN IT HAS WORKED AND IS CONTINUING TO WORK TO  STOP DISCRIMINATORY CHANGES IS  LIKE THROWING AWAY YOUR UMBRELLA IN A RAINSTORM BECAUSE YOU ARE  NOT GETTING WET. OH, DON'T BE SUCH AN ALARMIST.   ( APPLAUSE )   DON'T BE SUCH AS AN ALARMIST. I'M SURE IT WILL BE YEARS BEFORE  MISSISSIPPI TAKES THE VOTE AWAY  FROM DAMP PEOPLE. NOW, THANKFULLY, NOT EVERYONE IS  STUCK IN THE PAST LIKE GEORGIA  GOVERNOR NATHAN DEAL, WHO CELEBRATED THE RULING SAYING,  "OVER THE LAST HALF CENTURY  GEORGIA HAS REFORMED AND OUR STATE IS IS A PROUD SYMBOL OF  PROGRESS."  YES, GEORGIA IS A TRUE SYMBOL OF  RACIAL PROGRESS. AFTER ALL, GEORGIA HASN'T HAD  THIS FLAG SINCE 2003. SO WHAT DO THESE CASES HAVE IN  COMMON? GRAB A PENCIL, FOLKS BECAUSE  HERE IT COMES. IN DOMA AND THE VOTING RIGHTS  ACT CASES, IT WAS ABOUT STATES'  RIGHTS, NOT THE PEOPLE IN THOSE  STATES. THAT'S WHY THE FIRST WORDS OF  THE CONSTITUTION ARE "WE THE  STATES."  I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO READ THOSE GAY LETTERS. WE'LL BE BACK WITH EMILY  BAZELON.
