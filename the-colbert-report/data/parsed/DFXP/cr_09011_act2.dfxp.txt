WE ARE BACK, THANK YOU FOLKS,  THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. I HAVE SAID IT MANY TIMES ON  THIS SHOW, ANY DOG CAN FATHER A  LITER, BUT ONLY ALPHA DOG WILL  DENY IT PUPPY SUPPORT. IT IS TIME FOR MY ALPHA DOG OF  THE WEEK. THIS WEEK ALPHA DOG TENNESSEE  CONGRESSMAN SCOTT DESJARLAIS. THIS REPUBLICAN ROTTWEILER IS A  STAUNCH FAMILY VALUES CULTURE  WARRIOR WHOSE WEB SITE SAYS ALL  LIFE SHOULD BE CHERISHED AND PROTECTED AND RECENTLY DESCRIBED  HIMSELF AS A CONSISTENT  SUPPORTER OF PRO-LIFE VALUES. NOW I HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR ON  WHERE I STAND ON THIS DIVISIVE  ISSUE. AND ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH ME  SHOULD BE FAILED INTO A COFFIN  FULL OF SPIKES.
WELL, DESJARLAIS RECENTLY  PROVED HIS FLEXIBILITY BY  LIFTING HIS LEG AND PEEING ON  HIS OWN POSITION.
A PRO-LIFE TENNESSEE  CONGRESSMAN CAUGHT ON TAPE,  REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE AND  PHYSICIAN SCOTT DESJARLAIS HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH A PATIENT AND  SHE BECAME PREGNANT.
Colbert: SHOCKING. A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSMAN WAS CAUGHT HAVING AN  ILLICIT AFFAIR AND IT WASN'T  WITH A MAN!  WOOHOO!  BUT FOLKS THIS AFFAIR IS NOT NOW  DESJARLAIS SHOWED HE HAS THE  SWING SACK TO LEAD THE ALPHA  PACK. REPRESENTATIVE SCOTT DESJARLAIS  DOESN'T DISPUTE A TRANSCRIPT OF  A RECORDED PHONE CONVERSATION IN  WHICH HE BEARS TO URGE THE WOMAN TO TERMINATE THE PREGNANCY. DURING THE CONVERSATION,  DESJARLAIS AND THE WOMAN  BICKERED BACK AND FORTH ABOUT  HER GETTING AN ABORTION WITH DESJARLAIS AT ONE POINT TELLING  THE WOMAN, QUOTE, YOU TOLD ME  YOU WOULD HAVE AN ABORTION. NOW --
Colbert: BEFORE YOU JUDGE,  BEFORE YOU JUDGE I SAID  DESJARLAIS'S ACTIONS ARE  ABSOLUTELY CONSISTENT WITH HIS  BELIEFS. HE IS STILL ADAMANTLY AGAINST  ABORTION EXCEPT WHEN IT  ENDANGERS THE POLITICAL LIFE OF  THE FATHER, BUT, FOLKS THAT STILL IS NOT LIKE DESJARLAIS IS  MY ALPHA DOG, NO HE IS MY ALPHA  DOG BECAUSE HE REPORTEDLY MADE  THE TAPE OF THE PHONE CONVERSATION HIMSELF TO PLAY FOR  HIS WIFE, BECAUSE HE APPARENTLY  THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP REPAIR THE  MARRIAGE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE  ONLY WAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN  ALPHA BALLSIER IS IF HE TOOK HIS  WIFE TO A ROMANTIC SEASIDE COTTAGE AND TOLD HER, HONEY,  GUESS WHO I AM NO LONGER BONING  ON THIS BED?  BUT FOR SOME  REASON, HIS WIFE STILL DIVORCED  HIM. BUT, LADIES, HE IS AVAILABLE!   WELL, TECHNICALLY HE IS  REMARRIED, BUT THAT HAS NEVER  STOPPED HIM BEFORE!  SO, CONGRESSMAN DESJARLAIS, FOR  GROWLING AT ABORTION AND THEN  BEGGING FOR IT, YOU, SIR, ARE MY  ALPHA DOG OF THE WEEK. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
