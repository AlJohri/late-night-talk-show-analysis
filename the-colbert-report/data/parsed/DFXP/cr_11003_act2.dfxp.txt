WELCOME BACK. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS DURING THE COMMERCIAL BREAK -- DURING THIS LAST COMMERCIAL BREAK, I FOUND OUT THAT I HAVE UPSET SOMEONE VERY DEAR TO ME. BILL O'REILLY. MY MENTOR, MY NORTH STAR,  THE EMERGENCY CONTACT ON MY SOUL CYCLE MEMBERSHIP. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT HURTS ME TO KNOW I HURT THE MAN I ADMIRE MOST, JUST AS BILL WOULD BE HURT IF HE HURT THE MAN HE ADMIRES MOST: HIMSELF. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU SEE, LAST THURSDAY, I PRAISED BILL'S PLAN TO WIN THE WAR ON TERROR WITH AN INTERNATIONAL ARMY OF 25,000 PAID MERCENARIES, MAKING IT ALMOST AS LARGE AS THE CAST OF "THE EXPENDABLES III." ( LAUGHTER ) I LOVED PAPA BEAR'S IDEA OF WAR WITHOUT POLITICAL RED TAPE SO MUCH, THAT I PUT FORTH MY OWN EQUALLY-THOUGHT-OUT PLAN FROM THE FOURTH GRADE. AN ARMY OF EXPERT DOUBLE NINJA SUPER SOLDIERS WITH LASER NUNCHUCKS. IT'S A CAN'T-FAIL STRATEGY. I DID NOT EVEN INCLUDE THEIR ALLIES-- THE PIRATE BOATERCYCLE GANG. BUT SOMEHOW, SOMEHOW, FOLKS, BILL O'REILLY TOOK BILL O'FFENSE.
PEOPLE LIKE STEPHEN COLBERT MOCKING THE PLAN. THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. BUT BY BEING COMPLETELY VACANT, IT DOESN'T STOP THESE PEOPLE FROM MOCKING IDEAS THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME VALUE, MIGHT SOLVE SOME COMPLEX PROBLEMS. MR. COLBERT AND OTHERS OF HIS ILK HAVE NO BLEEPIN' CLUE HOW TO FIGHT THE JIHAD.
STEPHEN:  THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS! BILL O'REILLY HAS TO DO HIS OWN BLEEPING? COME ON, RUPERT MURDOCK. SPRING FOR THE BLEEP MACHINE! I'VE GOT ONE. WATCH: BILL O'REILLY IS A (BLEEP) EGOMANIAC. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, I'M SURE-- I'M SURE-- (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!)
I AM POSITIVE-- I AM ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE THAT THAT WAS BLEEPPED FOR BROADCAST, BECAUSE I DON'T MEAN IT. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOW CAN BILL SAY ME AND OTHERS OF MY ILK DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW TO FIGHT JIHAD? BILL, BABY DOLL, YOU'RE OF MY ILK. BILL, BABY DOLL, YOU'RE OF MY ILK. WE'RE ILK MATES. WE'RE MEMBERS OF THE SAME ILK LODGE. WE DIP OUR COOKIES IN THE SAME GLASS OF ILK I WASN'T MOCKING YOUR PLAN. I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO LIKES IT EVERYONE ON YOUR OWN SHOW THINKS YOU'RE INSANE.
THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA. IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA NOT JUST AS A PRACTICAL MATTER BUT AS A MORAL MATTER.
WITH YOUR IDEA YOU'VE GONE FROM OUT OF THE BOX TO OFF THE WALL.
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS I OPPOSE THIS.
WHAT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY?
THERE IS A HIGHLY TRAINED SKILLED FORCE THAT CAN GO FORTH IN MANY OF THESE PLACES. IT'S ALREADY TRAINED BY OUR SPECIAL FORCES.
IT COULD TURN INTO A FRANKENSTEIN COURSE YOU CAN'T CONTROL WITH UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
STEPHEN:  A FRANKENSTEIN FORCE? HAS SHE BEEN READING MY NOTEBOOK. DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE GUYS, BILL, PLENTY OF PEOPLE LOVE YOUR PLAN.
LAST WEEK WE ASKED YOU TO VOTE IN A BILL O'REILLY.COM POLL. DO YOU BELIEVE A MERCENARY FORCE PAID FOR BY COALITION NATIONS IS A GOOD IDEA? 70% YES, 30% NO. ABOUT 20,000 OF YOU VOTED
SEE, 70% IN A NONSCIENTIFIC POLL. THAT MEANS BILL'S MOST LOYAL FANS, VOTING AS MANY TIMES AS THEY WANT, GAVE IT AN OVERWHELMING C-MINUS. AND TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM PUTTING UP AN EVEN LESS-SCIENTIFIC POLL ON MY WEBSITE ASKING THE NATION WHOSE PLAN IS BETTER, MINE OR BILL'S. AND THE RESULTS ARE IN BEFORE I'VE EVEN ASKED-- IT'S THAT UNSCIENTIFIC. AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY BOTH GOT 100%. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MEANWHILE-- MEANWHILE, 96 VOTED "THIS IS A POLL," IN MY "IS THIS A POLL?" POLL. TOUGH DEFEAT FOR RICE CAKES. AT THAT POINT, I THOUGHT BILL WAS DONE WITH ME. TURNED OUT, HE WASN'T BLEEPING FINISHED.
IN THE WORLD OF THE IDEOLOGUE WHERE COLBERT LIVES, SOLUTIONS DON'T REALLY MATTER. IT'S HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THINGS. SO IN YOUR LIFE, WHEN YOU CONFRONT A PERSON WHO CRITICIZES YOU BUT HAS NOTHING CONSTRUCTIVE TO SAY, RUN FAST.
STEPHEN: EVEN MORE GREAT MILITARY ADVICE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) REMEMBER, REMEMBER, REMEMBER, MERCENARIES WHEN YOU YOU CONFRONT OPPOSITION, RUN FAST. I THINK BILL'S THE ONE WHO TRAINED THE IRAQI ARMY. BUT I'M MAN ENOUGH TO ADMIT THAT BILL IS RIGHT. I AM AN IDEALOGUE, AND THAT'S WHY I'M NOT WORTHY OF HIS MERCENARY ARMY, BECAUSE MERCENARIES DON'T HAVE IDEOLOGY. THEY JUST KILL ANYONE YOU PAY THEM TO. IN FACT, IF SOMEONE ELSE PAYS THEM MORE, THEY'LL KILL YOU! THAT'S JUST THE FREE MARKET. ( APPLAUSE ) SO, BILL, PLEASE, I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING THAT I FEEL. LET'S NOT FIGHT. OR IF WE DO FIGHT, BILL, LET'S AT LEAST PAY OTHER PEOPLE TO DO IT FOR US. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
