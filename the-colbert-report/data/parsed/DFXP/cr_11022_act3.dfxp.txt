Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW REALITY SHOW CALLED  "HOUSE OF D.V.F." TO SAVOR THE INTERVIEW, YOU WILL WANT TO RECORD IT ON YOUR  "BOX OF D.V.R." PLEASE WELCOME DIANE VON FURSTENBERG! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MADAME VON FURSTENBERG,  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE! LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, BEING SO ELEGANT AS ALWAYS.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA WEAR A WRAP DRESS TODAY.
Stephen: A WRAP DRESS? JIMMY, LET'S PUT THAT UP.  YOU ARE  KNOWN AMONG MANY THINGS FOR THE ICONIC WRAP DRESS. 40 YEARS AGO I WOULD LOVE TO BUT MY HIPS ARE SO UNFORGIVING.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WAIST. YOU JUST WRAP IT AROUND AND A FEEL SEXY.
Stephen: WHY AREN'T YOU WEARING ONE THEN
WELL, BECAUSE I HAVE NO WAIST ANYMORE.
Stephen: HOW DOES IT DO WITH A GUT? THAT'S ME, NOT YOU, MADAM. (LAUGHTER) OKAY, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE, FASHION DESIGNER, ENTREPRENEUR, THE ICONIC WRAP DRESS. YOU HAVE A NEW SHOW CALLED "HOUSE OF D.V.F." WHICH WE'LL GET TO IN A MOMENT, BUT FIRST YOU HAVE A BOOK CALLED "THE WOMAN I WANTED TO BE." DIANE VON FURSTENBERG YOU HAVE BEEN A PRINCESS, YOU HAVE BEEN A FASHION DESIGNER, WHICH ARE THE TWO MOST POPULAR BARBIES. IS THERE ANY KIND OF WOMAN YOU WANTED TO BE BUT NEVER WERE?
NO, BECAUSE I THINK THE WOMAN YOU WANT TO BE IS MANY DIFFERENT WOMEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES, AND --
Stephen: SOUNDS VAGUELY SCHIZOPHRENIC.
NO, NO, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF LIVING YOUR FANTASY, DOING IT NICE, SERIOUSLY, BUT DREAMING ABOUT WHO YOU WANT TO BE AND BECOMING WHO YOU WANT TO BE. I WAS LUCKY. I CAME TO AMERICA AND LIVED THIS BIG AMERICAN DREAM, BECOMING THE WOMAN I WANTED TO BE.
Stephen: WHEN DID YOU BECOME HER?
WELL, EARLY.
Stephen: EARLY? I WAS MAYBE 27, 28. BUT THE GOOD THING IS THAT I BECAME THAT WOMAN WHILE I WAS -- I HAD COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE OTHER WOMEN BE THE WOMAN YOU WANT TO BE. SO, YOU SEE, I BECAME CONFIDENT WHILE I WAS MAKING OTHER WOMEN CONFIDENT.
Stephen: WERE YOU MAKING OTHER WOMEN INTO THE WOMAN YOU WANTED TO BE OR THEY WANTED TO BE?
NO!
Stephen: DOESN'T FASHION DO THAT TO US? DOESN'T IT SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU WILL BE WEARING THIS YEAR, DARLING?
NO, NO.
Stephen: GREEN IS OUT! IT'S ALL CERULIUM THIS YEAR NO, NO, NO. ALL I DO IS I GIVE WOMEN THE LITTLE TRICKS, THE LITTLE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE THEM LOOK SEXY AND FEEL EMPOWERED.
Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT FOR MEN? DON'T WE DESERVE TO FEEL SEXY AND EMPOWERED AS WELL? YOU'RE A FEMINIST ICON -- (APPLAUSE) AREN'T YOU BEING SEXIST AGAINST MEN? WHAT MAKES A MAN SEXY?
VIAGRA? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ANYWAY, THAT'S THE WORST THING THAT HAPPENED TO WOMEN IN THE LAST TEN YEARS, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: VIAGRA? WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S NO POINT IN A MAN'S LIFE WHEN HE WILL GIVE IT A REST?
YES, BECAUSE WE LOST OUR KIND OF EDGE. BUT WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: NO, WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT DIANE VON FURSTENBERG.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT DREW YOU TO FASHION AT AN EARLY AGE?
THE THING IS THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WANTED TO DO BUT I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO BE -- WHO I WANTED TO BE. I WANTED TO BE INDEPENDENT.
Stephen: YOU CAME FROM WEALTH, RIGHT? AND YOU MARRIED ENORMOUS WEALTH. (LAUGHTER) INDEPENDENCE WAS THE EASIER PART, WASN'T IT?
WELL BUT THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WANT IT YOU SEE, I BECAME INDEPENDENT ON MY OWN WITH ONE LITTLE DRESS, AND MY THING IN LIFE IS ONCE I EMPOWERED MYSELF IS TO EMPOWER OTHERS. MY TV SHOW, "HOUSE OF D.V.F.," WE PREMIERED TWO WEEKS AGO, SUNDAY, EVERY SUNDAY, THEY TOLD ME TO TELL YOU THAT, EVERY SUNDAY ON E AT 10:00 (STEPHEN REPEATING)
AND IT'S THE STORY OF EIGHT, HOT, SEXY GIRLS --
Stephen: THAT'S A BOLD CHOICE IN FASHION. GO AHEAD.
AND THEY COME INTO MY WORLD AND THEY LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT DESIGN AND MERCHANDISING AND P.R. AND ONE WILL BECOME A  BRAND AMBASSADOR.
Stephen:  FOR DVF I DON'T WANT ANY SPOILERS, BUT WHAT ARE THE ODDS AT THE END OF THE SEASON YOU WIN? (APPLAUSE) BECAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY AN EXCELLENT BRAND AMBASSADOR FOR D.V.F.
YES, BUT I'M GETTING OLD! I CAN'T BE THE ONE, I NEED FRESHNESS
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT D.V.F. HOW DOES ONE GET INTO THE THREE-INITIAL CLUB?  YOU GOT J.F.K., L.B.J., K.F.C., D.V.F.  WHY NOT DIANE VON FURSTENBERG
IT'S SO LONG!
Stephen: IT'S A LOVELY TRIP THOUGH.
IT'S A LONG JOURNEY. I DON'T KNOW, I BECAME DVF. EVEN MY CHILDREN CALL ME D.V.F.
Stephen: REALLY? YEAH. MY SON. NOT MY DAUGHTER. BUT ANYWAY THAT'S WHO I AM
Stephen: YOUR SON CALLS YOU D.V.F.? HE DOESN'T CALL  YOU MOMMY?
WELL HE'S NOT A LITTLE THING BUT STILL, IT'S A LITTLE COLD.
NO, NO, THERE'S NOTHING COLD ABOUT MY SON.
Stephen: WELL THERE'S NOTHING COLD ABOUT YOU EITHER. A LOT OF WOMEN SAY, OH, YOU MEN HAVE IT EASY, YOU WEAR SUITS, STUFF LIKE THAT. IF WOMEN DON'T HAVE THE DRESS UNIFORM FOR WORK THE WAY MEN ARE TOLD THE WAY THEY DO FOR A SUIT, IF YOU COULD DESIGN THE THING WOMEN WORE AS A WORK UNIFORM AS A SUIT, WHAT WOULD IT BE?
CONFIDENCE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THERE IT IS, DIANE VON FURSTENBERG, LADIES. SHE SAYS CONFIDENCE AND NOTHING ELSE. (LAUGHTER) DIANE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) "THE WOMAN I WANTED TO BE," DIANE VON FURSTENBERG. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
