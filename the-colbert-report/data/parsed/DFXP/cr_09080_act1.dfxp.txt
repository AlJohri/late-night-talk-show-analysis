[EAGLE CAW]ï¿½r ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [EAGLE CAW] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN!"] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT,  EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS, YOU ASK ANY POLITICAL  REPORTER OUT THERE THERE'S NO  BIGGER NIGHT IN POLITICS THEN THE DAY AFTER THE RUNOFF  ELECTION  IN A SPECIAL ELECTION FOR SOUTH  CAROLINA'S 1st DISTRICT, AND "THE COLBERT REPORT" CAN NOW  PROJECT THAT SOME OTHER NETWORK  WILL TELL US THE WINNER. JIM? [LAUGHTER]
THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT. WELL, HE'S BACK. AFTER A SEX SCANDAL DERAILED HIS  POLITICAL CAREER FOUR YEARS AGO,  TONIGHT, SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR MARK SANFORD WINNING THE GOP  NOMINATION FOR A U.S. HOUSE  SEAT.
Stephen: YES, FORMER SOUTH  CAROLINA GOVERNOR AND  APPALACHIAN HIKER WITH EXTREMELY POOR SENSE OF DIRECTION, MARK  SANFORD, HAS SECURED THE  REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. [LAUGHTER] WHAT A STUNNING COMEBACK. AFTER BEING UNFAITHFUL TO HIS  WIFE AND BETRAYING THE PUBLIC  TRUST, HE GETS A SECOND CHANCE IN POLITICS -- ONLY IN AMERICA. AND ITALY. [LAUGHTER] BUNGA! BUNGA, MARK. BUNGA! BUNGA! [LAUGHTER] AND IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE  THIS OFF-YEAR ELECTION THE  POLITICAL STORY OF THE MILLENIUM, JUST LISTEN TO WHO  HIS OPPONENT IS.
HE'LL FACE ELIZABETH COLBERT  BUSH.
SHE IS THE SISTER OF TV  PERSONALITY STEPHEN COLBERT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: YES, MY SISTER IS  RUNNING FOR CONGRESS AGAINST  MARK SANFORD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WOO! WOO! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HOPE SHE PUTS ME ON THE POSTER  COMMITTEE. I'VE GOT SOME POSTERBOARD,  MARKERS -- [SNIFFS] THAT'S THE STUFF -- GLUE AND  GLUE RIGHT ON THERE. A LITTLE BIT OF GLITTER RIGHT  THERE. GOT THAT RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ORIGINALLY, I WASN'T GOING TO  TALK ABOUT THIS RACE ON MY  NIGHTLY BROADCAST. I GOTTA WATCH WHERE I AIM THIS  THING. [LAUGHTER] BUT THEN I WATCHED TODAY'S  COFFEE JOE MORNING AND THE FUNKY  BUNCH. [LAUGHTER] JIM?
WE WILL SPEAK WITH MARK  SANFORD COMING UP IN A FEW  MINUTES AND BE SENDING AN INVITATION OUT TO ELIZABETH  COLBERT BUSH.
SHE HAS HER OWN SHOW.
IT'S GOING TO BE "MORNING  JOE" VERSUS "COLBERT REPORT." [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Stephen: OH, IT IS ON. [LAUGHTER] "MORNING JOE" VERSUS "THE  COLBERT REPORT."  DID I WANT THIS FIGHT? NO, BUT THIS MORNING--
THEY DREW FIRST BLOOD, NOT  ME. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: OF COURSE, IN SOME  WAYS, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN "MORNING  JOE" VERSUS "THE COLBERT REPORT."  THOUGH, TECHNICALLY AT THAT TIME  OF THE MORNING, MY NETWORK RUNS  A P-80X COMMERCIAL.
P-90 X USES THE ADVANCED  SCIENCE OF MUSCLE CONFUSION.
Stephen: YES, IT'S ALL ABOUT  THE MUSCLE CONFUSION. [LAUGHTER] WHEREAS JOE'S SHOW IS JUST ABOUT  CONFUSION IN THAT SOMETIMES  PEOPLE CONFUSE IT WITH NEWS. [LAUGHTER] BUT NOT THIS MORNING, 'CUZ THIS  MORNING WAS JUST PURE  INFOMERCIAL FOR HIS OLD BUDDY, MARK SANFORD.
I'VE BEEN A GOOD FRIEND OF  MARK'S FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I KNOW MARK -- BRIGHT, BRIGHT  GUY AND HE WORKED ON WALL STREET  AND KNOWS THE ISSUES BETTER THAN  ANYBODY. COURSES, COURSES SHOULD BE  TAUGHT IN THE FUTURE ON THE WAY  MARK SANFORD RAN HIS CAMPAIGN. SOME PEOPLE HAVE GOT IT. YOU CAN SEE WHY A GUY LIKE THAT  GETS ELECTED. LET'S PRETEND MARK IS NOT HERE  AND TALK ABOUT HIM.
WHAT I HEARD WAS THAT HE  WORKED REALLY HARD, HE WAS GOOD  TO HIS EMPLOYEES.
MARK, IF WE CAN LET'S TALK  ABOUT THE VALUE OF HONESTY IN  POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE, NO  MATTER WHERE THEY ARE IN THE  IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM WERE STRUCK BY YOUR HONESTY A FEW YEARS AGO  WHEN BASICALLY YOU SAID, YOU  KNOW, YOU WENT WALKING ON THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL, BUT YOU FELL  IN LOVE, SO YOU'RE OUT OF PUBLIC  OFFICE. SO WHEN YOU MAKE THE DECISION TO  RE-ENTER THE FRAY, WAS THERE ANY  FEAR OF THAT HONESTY COMING BACK AND PLAYING A PERILOUS ROLE IN  YOUR POLITICAL FUTURE?
Stephen: OH, THAT IS IN  IN-DEPTH REPORTING. YOU KNOW, WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN  MAY HAVE HAD DEEP THROAT, BUT  MIKE BARNACLE IS DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR TO MARK SANFORD. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HOPE MIKE CAN BREATHE THROUGH  HIS NOSE 'CUZ HE'S RIGHT. HE'S RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN SANFORD FINALLY RESURFACED,  THE FIRST THING THAT EVERYONE  THOUGHT WAS "MAN, THAT GUY IS BEING SO HONEST ABOUT HOW MUCH  HE LIED." [LAUGHTER] AND I'M SURE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN  JUST AS HONEST IF NO ONE HAD  CAUGHT HIM. [LAUGHTER] WELL, IT'S MY TURN, JOJO. I'M GOING TO SHOCK SOME PEOPLE  RIGHT NOW AND ENDORSE MY SISTER,  ELIZABETH COLBERT BUSCH FOR  CONGRESS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YES, YES, YES, SHE'S A DEMOCRAT. BUT SHE'S A BUSINESS WOMAN, A  JOB. CREATOR, WHO WHEN RAISING THREE  CHILDREN ON $14,000 A YEAR, WENT  BACK TO SCHOOL, BUILT A 20-YEAR CAREER IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE,  AND IS NOW LEADING MARK SANFORD  IN TWO CONSECUTIVE POLLS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS, NATION? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YEAH! YEAH! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I'LL TELL YOU, MARK SANFORD  SHOULD THANK YOU YOU JOE  SCARBOROUGH BECAUSE I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT IF YOU HAD NOT  INSPIRED ME. FOLKS -- I TELL YOU THIS GUN  CONTROL DEBATE IS GETTING OUT OF  HAND. LIBERALS ARE LETTING THEIR  EMOTIONS GET THE BEST OF THEM. WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK. OKAY, LIKE THIS BUT WITH FEET. [LAUGHTER] KEEP THIS DEBATE BASED ON LOGIC  AND REASON. ONE PERSON TAKING MANY STEPS  BACK IS TEXAS REPUBLICAN AND  PROUD OWNER OF THE "PETTICOAT JUNCTION" DVD BOX SET, LOUIE  GOHMERT. LISTEN TO HIS CLEAR EXPLANATION  AS TO WHY YOU CAN'T LIMIT LARGE  CAPACITY MAGAZINES.
WELL, ONCE YOU MAKE IT TEN,  THEN WHY WOULD YOU DRAW THE LINE  AT TEN? AND THE PROBLEM IS ONCE YOU DRAW  THAT LIMIT, IT'S KIND OF LIKE  MARRIAGE, WHEN YOU SAY IT'S NOT A MAN AND A WOMAN ANYMORE, THEN  WHY NOT HAVE THREE MEN AND ONE  WOMAN, OR FOUR WOMEN AND ONE MAN, OR WHY NOT SOMEBODY HAS A  LOVE FOR AN ANIMAL? [LAUGHTER]
STEPHEN: A SOUND ARGUMENT --  IN THAT HE MADE A SOUND. [LAUGHTER] LOUIE IS RIGHT. PEOPLE LOVE HIM. AND HE'S RIGHT: ONCE YOU START  PUTTING BULLETS LIMITS ON  MAGAZINE SIZE, WHERE DOES IT  STOP? NINE, ELEVEN? THEN SOME OTHER STUFF HE SAID,  BLAH BLAH BLAH ORGY IN THE BARN. [LAUGHTER] NOW, EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M A  HUNTER. IF I DON'T HAVE A 30 ROUND CLIP  TO SHOOT THESE ANIMALS, WHAT  WILL STOP ME FROM HAVING SEX WITH THEM? [LAUGHTER] IT'S BASIC LOGIC:  IF A = B, AND B= C, THEN SOONER  OR LATER, YOU'RE BANGING A BEE,  SEE? [LAUGHTER] I DON'T MIND ADMITTING  THIS PAST SEASON, I WAS OUT  HUNTING WHITETAIL DEER WITH THE  BOYS. SUDDENLY, THIS LONG-LEGGED DOE  COMES PRANCING INTO MY SIGHTS  WITH THOSE BIG, BROWN EYES, THOSE SINEWY HAUNCHES, THAT  COME-HITHER FLICK OF AN UPTURNED  TAIL, AND I THOUGHT, "GUN TO ITS HEAD?" YOU BET. [LAUGHTER] ESPECIALLY IF THAT GUN DOESN'T  HAVE BULLETS. BECAUSE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THAT  DOE IS GETTING MOUNTED. [LAUGHTER] BUT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE  NOW WELL-ESTABLISHED FACT THAT  GUN CONTROL CAUSES BESTIALITY. [LAUGHTER] AS LOUIE GOHMERT'S LOGICAL  ARGUMENT HAS PROVEN, ANY LIBERAL  POLICY EVENTUALLY LEADS TO SEX WITH ANIMALS. [LAUGHTER] IT'S A LITTLE GAME I CALL "SIX  DEGREES OF HUMPING BACON." [LAUGHTER] JUST TAKE THE LIBERALS' FAVORITE  CAUSE:  CLIMATE CHANGE. YOU PUT A CAP ON CARBON  EMISSIONS, THAT'S LIKE PUTTING A  CONDOM ON A SMOKE STACK. [LAUGHTER] AND WHAT WERE CONDOMS ORIGINALLY  MADE OF? SHEEP INTESTINE. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'RE  SAYING "HEY, LET'S CUT OUT THE  MIDDLE MAN" AND HELLO DOLLY! OR TAKE RAISING TAXES ON THE  RICH PEOPLE. OKAY? THOSE POOR RICH PEOPLE WILL HAVE  LESS DISPOSABLE INCOME. THAT MEANS LESS DONATIONS TO  THINGS LIKE MUSEUMS, PARKS AND  ZOOS. THOSE ZOO ANIMALS AREN'T  PROPERLY GUARDED AND THEY ESCAPE  INTO THE CITY, WHERE TO GET BY, THEY HAVE TO TURN TRICKS AND  SUDDENLY YOU'RE DOING THE NO-NO  WITH A BONOBO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. POINT IS, HAVEN'T WE SPENT  ENOUGH ON ROADS?
