WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUESS TONIGHT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF -- PLEASE WELCOME KEN ROTH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, KEN. GOOD TO SEE YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN YOU ARE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT SOUNDS MONSTEROUS, DOING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS GOING ON AND YOU JUST STAND THERE AND WATCH. WHY NOT HUMAN RIGHTS DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO DO.
Stephen: OKAY.
DICTATORS AROUND THE WORLD HATE HAVING THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS EXPOSED SO WE INVESTIGATE THEM, EXPOSE WHAT THEY DO WE SHAME THEM AND PUT PRESSURE ON THEM TO STOP.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU SHAME DICTATORS.
NOBODY LIKES TO HAVE THEIR HUMAN RIGHT AS BUSES KNOWN EVEN SADDAL HUGHES HUGHES TRIED TO HIDE THE GENOCIDE.
Stephen: YEAH, I DON'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT MY INTERN.
I'LL HAVE A RESEARCHER HERE TOMORROW.
BUT IF YOU SHINE A SPOTLIGHT, GET THE PRESS TO COVER AND REPORT THEY HATE THAT THEY TRY TO DISCREDIT US. ULTIMATELY THEY REALIZE THEY CAN'T CHANGE THE BAD PRESS UNTIL THEY CHANGE THE BAD CONDUCT.
Stephen: RIGHT BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS WE LOST NELSON MANDELA CALLED BY MANY A GIANT BUT ALSO A COMMUNIST AND A TERRORIST AT TIMES. HOW DOES SOMEONE LIKE MANDELA BECKMAN DELLA.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, HE WAS IN PRISON FOR 27 YEARS.
Stephen: AS A COMMUNIST AND A TERRORIST.
AS A PERSON WHO WANTED TO GET RID OF APARTHEID.
Stephen: HE BROKE THE LAW AND I'M NOT SOFT ON CRIME, GO AHEAD.
FAIR ENOUGH, BECAUSE THE LAW KEPT BLACK PEOPLE SEPARATE AND SUPPRESSED. HE WAS IN PRISON FOR 27 YEARS. HE CAME OUT AND RATHER THAN SHOWING BITTERNESS TOWARDS HIS JAILERS HE RECOGNIZED THEY WERE ALL SOUTH AFRICANS AND HE WAS GOING TO CREATE A NEW SOUTH AFRICA, WHEN HE WAS NEGOTIATING HIS FUTURE, HE MADE A PLACE FOR ALL SOUTH AFRICANS UNDER THE LAW WITH RIGHTS FOR EVERYBODY. THAT IS HOW MANDELA BECAME MANDELA.
Stephen: SO HE FORGAVE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS.
IN ESSENCE, YES.
Stephen: WHY CAN'T YOU FORGIVE THE PEOPLE WHO-- WHY CAN'T YOU BE MORE LIKE NELSON PAN DELLA?
SO IF I AM OUT THERE LOOKING FOR-- BECAUSE I WANT TO GET IN LIKE ON THE GROUND FLOOR ON THE NEXT MORAL RIGHTOUSNESS OUT THERE, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF APARTHEID AGAIN IT'S A LONG STORY, A LONG STORY. I THOUGHT WAS A GOOD IDEA. TO THE BECAUSE THEY'RE BLACK BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE POOR. BUT WE'LL MOVE ON.
YOU AND RONALD REAGAN.
EXACTLY. GROVER NORQUIST. I WAS OVER THERE-- NOW WHO WAS THE GUY LIKE IF I WANT TO GET BEHIND, START PRINTING THE POSTERS AND SELLING THE BUTTONS IF I WANT TO BE THE GUY THAT SAYS I'M ON BOARD WITH MANDELA WHO IS MY NEW MANDELA.
I THINK THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE IS THE CHINESE BY THE NAME OF-- SHAPO.
THIS IS WHAT WORRIED ME.
WITHOUT WON THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
BIG DEAL,.
WHAT WORRIES ME IS THIS ONE IS GOING TO COST ME, ALL RIGHT.
IN CHINA WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING. AM I GOING TO PROTEST THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
OKAY, IT'S NOT THE ROTH REPORT, IT'S "THE COLBERT REPORT," LET ME TALK.
Stephen: IN THE 80s WE COULD SAY TO SOUTH AFRICA I DON'T NEED YOUR GOLD, I DON'T NEED YOUR DIAMONDS, I DON'T NEED YOUR BLACK MUM BAZZA, WE COULD BOYCOTT THAT WE CAN'T BOYCOTT EVERYTHING MADE. THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO BUY.
Stephen: CHINA MAKES EVERYTHING.
RIGHT.
Stephen: SO WHAT LEVERAGE COULD WE HAVE AGAINST WHAT LEO-- WHAT LEVERAGE WHAT CAN WE DO FOR THIS CAT.
YOU TALK ABOUT HOW DICTATORS DIDN'T LIKE TO BE SHAMED. WHEN MANDELA DIED THE CHINESE OFFICIAL MEDIA IN DESCRIBING PAN DELLA WOULDN'T USE THE TERM FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY OR NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WHICH MANDELA ALSO WON BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID IT WOULD REMIND PEOPLE OF YOU KNOW WHO, THAT GUY. THEY'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT THIS. THEY'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT WHAT HE STANDS FOR WHICH IS BASICALLY FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS FOR THE CHINESE PEOPLE THAT THEY LOCKED HIM UP FOR 11 YEARS.
Stephen: WHAT IS HE IN JAIL FOR.
FOR SO-CALLED INCITING STATE SUBVERSION.
Stephen: DID HE INCITE STATE SUBVERSION.
IF YOU SAY PROMOTING DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, IN CHINA, YEAH.
Stephen: SO THERE IS ONE WHO IS THIS.
THIS IS NEBULA JAB WHO IS A BAHRAINI HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST, HE HEADS THE LEADING HUMAN RIGHTS CENTER IN BAHRAIN. HE HAD AWE DOSIT OT THINK THAT THE ARAB SPRING SHOULD APPLY TO AN ARAB MONARCHY IN BAHRAIN. FOR THAT WHICH WAS ANATHEMA JUST TO THE BAHRAINA KING BUT THE SAUDI KING NEXT DOOR. THE LAST THING THEY WANTED WAS A BEACON OF DEMOCRACY ACROSS THE CAUSEWAY SO THEY LOCKED HIM UP AND HAVE BEEN VIOLENTLY SUPPRESSING THE MOVEMENT HE WAS LEADING.
Stephen: WHAT IS HE IN JAIL FOR.
AGAIN BASICALLY FOR LEADING DEMONSTRATIONS.
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY. KING HUMAD IS A FRIEND OF MINE, PRESIDENT AND KING AND I GETTING TO. DID YOU EVER SEE THE HANGOVER? IT'S LIKE THAT EXCEPT THE TIGER BELONGS THERE.
OF COURSE.
Stephen: WHAT DOW MEAN OF COURSENESS IT'S THE UNITED STATES. ARE YOU FAMILY WITH AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM.
YES, I KNOW.
Stephen: THEN I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY ON BEHALF OF AMERICA WHAT HUMAN RIGHTS, YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT GUANTANAMO.
THERE'S GUANTANAMO.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT IN THE UNITED STATES, THAT'S IN CUBA. CHECKMATE.
YES,NESS I WAS IF GUANTANAMO.
Stephen: THEY LET YOU OUT.
MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IN ADDITION TO A DETENTION CENTER IT ALSO A NAVAL BASE THERE IS A McDONALD'S AND A MALL AND A SOCCER FIELD AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BUT THEY ALSO LOCKED UP 155 PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY TRIAL, ANY CHARGES IN THOSE CASES.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO GOT ARRESTED FOR POT BEFORE IT WAS LEGAL IN COLORADO.
RIGHT.
Stephen: ARE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN COLORADO? JAIL FOR SOMETHING THAT IS NOW LEGAL? ARE THEY THE VICTIMS OF HUMAN RIGHT AS BECAUSES?
WELL, I THINK THE DRUG WAR IS A GREAT IDEA IF YOU WANT TO SORT OF RAISE THE PRICE OF DRUGS SO THAT YOU ARE FUELING THE CARTELS F YOU WANT TO IMPRISON LARGE NUMBERS OFA AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES NOR NONVIOLENT OFFENSES. IF YOU WANT TO INVADE PEOPLE'S PRIVACIES AROUND THE WORLD, AROUND THE UNITED STATES, IT'S GREAT TO PURSUE THE DRUG WAR.
Stephen: OKAY, WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DAN ROTH, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
