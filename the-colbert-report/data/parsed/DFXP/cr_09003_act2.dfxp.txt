Colbert: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I DO MY BEST YEAR AFTER YEAR  TRYING TO STAY HEALTHY. EVERY YEAR, I DON'T JUST GET MY  PROSTATE CHECKED, I GET IT  CHECKMATED.
AND MY APOLOGIES TO GARY CASS  PAR I DON'T HAVE, AGAIN I WILL  PAY FOR YOUR DRY CLEANING. THIS IS CHEATING DEATH WITH  DR. STEPHEN COLBERT, DFA. ..
FIRST UP, A DISCLAIMER, I AM  NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR. I HAVE AN HONORARY DOCTORATE IN  FINE ARTS, MEANING I CAN'T CURE  YOUR DERMATITIS BUT I CAN TREAT  YOU FOR APPLE FACE. AS ALWAYS, CHEATING DEATH  HIMSELF, BROUGHT TO YOU BY  PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS,  PRESCOTT, GO TOWARDS THE LIGHT. TONIGHT, HORMONE HEALTH.
GRRRR!  FOLKS, FOR THE LAST  15 YEARS I HAVE BEEN IN MY MID  30S BUT OLDER FELLOWS KNOW THAT WHEN YOU HIT A CERTAIN AGE YOU  LOSE THAT SPARK AND YOUR SEX  DRIVE GOES FROM I WILL TAG  ANYTHING THAT MOVES TO MAYBE TOMORROW, I JUST ATE A BURRITO. THE REASON IS THAT AS MEN AGE  THEIR TESTOSTERONE LEVELS DROP,  BUT THANKFULLY, PHARMACEUTICAL  MARKETERS HAVE THE ANSWER.
MILLIONS OF MEN 45 AND OLDER  JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY USED  TO.
REMEMBER WHEN YOU HAD MORE  ENERGY FOR 18 HOLES WITH YOUR  BUDDIES?  MORE PASSION FOR THE  ONE YOU LOVE?  MORE FUN WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS?  IT  COULD BE AN EASILY TREATABLE  CONDITION CALLED LOW T.
ANOTHER SIDE SIGN YOU HAVE  LOW T, YOUR SHADOW STILL ENJOYS  DISCO. NOW, JUST HOW SERIOUS IS LOW T?
SO WHAT IS NORMAL FOR WHAT  AGE?  THE AVERAGE 20-YEAR-OLD  TESTOSTERONE LEVELS CAN REACH AS  HIGH AS 1,080 BUT AS YOU AGE THE LEVELS DROP WITHOUT DRUGS, BY  AGE 60 THE AVERAGE HIGH IS ONLY  720.
Colbert: 720?  FOLKS, THE  NUMBERS DON'T LIE. OR EXPLAIN ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT  THEY MEAN. THANKFULLY, MIDDLE AGE MEN NOW  HAVE A WAY TO FEEL  INAPPROPRIATELY GOOD ABOUT  THEMSELVES.
HE HAS TRANSFORMED HIMSELF  INTO A YOUNGER MAN, 30 POUNDS OF  FAT, GONE. AND MUSCLE, BULGING MUSCLES.
HONESTLY I LIKE TO LOOK AT  MYSELF IN THE MIRROR BECAUSE I  LOOK FREAKING AWESOME.
Colbert: CLEARLY  TESTOSTERONE MAKES YOU LOOK  FREAKING AWESOME, OR DRASTICALLY  LOWERS YOUR FREAKING STANDARDS. AND AS THIS ATTRACTIVE LADY,  DOCTOR KNOWS THERE IS PROBABLY  NO DOWN SIDE TO ARTIFICIALLY  SUPER CHARGING YOUR ENDO CRINE  SYSTEM.
IF YOUR LEVELS ARE LOW AND  BRING YOU BACK TO A NORMAL LEVEL  OR OPTIMAL LEVEL YOU ARE  LEVELING THE PLAY FIELD.
Colbert: YEAH, YOU ARE JUST  LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD AND  IF I ONLY ANSWER IN RHETORICAL  QUESTIONS, CAN'T I, YOU KNOW, NOT GET SUED FOR MALPRACTICE?   OF COURSE, NOT EVERYBODY WANTS  YOU TO LOOK FRICKING AWE SOME.
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE  GUIDANCE IN THE MEDICAL RESEARCH  THAT SUGGESTS IT IS SAFE TO STAY  AT THOSE LEVELS.
Colbert: WHATEVER, DR. LOW  T, MAYBE IF YOUR HORMONES WERE  JACKED THROUGH THE ROOF YOU  WOULD HAVE THE BALLS TO JAM NEEDLES INTO PEOPLES IN  EXCLUSIVE CLINICAL TRIALS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: WHAT COULD  POSSIBLY GO WRONG?
THERE ARE SERIOUS POSSIBLE  SIDE EFFECTS OF TOO MUCH  TESTOSTERONE. BLOOD CLOTS, LIVER DAMAGE AND  SOME DOCTORS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT  ITS IMPACT ON PROSTATE CANCER.
Colbert: I WAS WATCHING  THOSE DISASTROUS, INSTEAD OF  LISTENING TO THOSE WARNINGS I  WAS CHECKING OUT HIS MUSCLES.
Colbert: WE NEED TO BALANCE  THEM OUT WITH SOME LADY JUICE. THAT'S WHY PRESCOTT IS PROUD TO  INTRODUCE TESTOSTERIN WHICH IS  TESTOSTERONE AND ESTROGEN. FOLKS, WITH LOTS OF THIS STUFF  YOU WILL NOT ONLY HAVE SIX-PACK  ABS YOU WILL HAVE DOUBLE D  BREASTS. YOU WILL NEVER BE LONELY AGAIN. SIDE EFFECTS OF THIS MAY INCLUDE  SICKENING AND ENLARGENING OF THE  HEART AND A HIDEOUS PORTRAIT IN  THE ATTIC THAT AGES AS YOU STAY  YOUNG.
THAT IS SO MUCH FOR  PHARMACEUTICAL, LOOK FOR OUR  DISPLAY IN THE BODIES EXHIBIT. UNTIL NEXT TIME, I WILL SEE YOU  IN HELL!
