(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. PLEASE WELCOME PETER BAKER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, PETER, NICE TO HAVE YOU ON. MR. BAKER, SIR, YOU ARE THE CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES".
YEAH.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TO SHIFT GEARS BETWEEN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION? BECAUSE YOU GUYS WERE SO TOUGH ON BUSH AND SO IN LOVE WITH OBAMA. (LAUGHTER)
RIGHT. THAT'S NOT WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD SAY. THEY DON'T SEEM TO THINK WE'RE VERY EASY ON HIM. BUT, LOOK, WE COVER ALL PRESIDENT IT IS SAME WAY. WE TRY TO BE TOUGH BUT FAIR AND TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.
LET'S FIND OUT HOW TOUGH AND FAIR YOU ARE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "DAYS OF FIRE: BUSH AND CHENEY IN THE WHITE HOUSE." OKAY, UM, I'M GOING TO DRAW -- A LINE RIGHT NOW, OKAY? I LOVE THIS MAN. I LOVE PRESIDENT BUSH. IF I READ YOUR BOOK-- AND NO PROMISES-- IF I READ YOUR BOOK WILL I LIKE HIM MORE OR LESS?
I THINK YOU'D LIKE PRESIDENT BUSH. I THINK IF YOU DON'T LIKE HIM YOU'LL SEE THINGS IN THERE THAT FEED THE ARGUMENT.
Stephen: SO IT'S A BOOK TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYONE?
TRYING TO FIND A -- (LAUGHTER). TRYING TO BE A NEUTRAL BOOK ABOUT TWO GUYS NOBODY FEELS NEUTRAL ABOUT SO IT'S A CHALLENGE.
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL NEUTRAL ABOUT THESE TWO GUYS. DO WE HAVE A PICTURE OF THESE TWO GUYS ON THE COVER THERE? THERE'S BUSH AND CHENEY. DO THEY WALK AROUND WASHINGTON LIKE THIS? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IS THAT AN ACTUAL PHOTO?
THAT'S AN ACTUAL PHOTO. THAT WAS A DAY THAT BUSH PUT CHENEY ON THE TICKET. "TIME" MAGAZINE TOOK THAT PICTURE BUT DIDN'T LOSE.
THIS WAS AN ACTUAL PHOTO?
YEAH!
Stephen: THIS IS LIKE BUSH SAYING "YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DEAL WITH ME, OKAY?" THIS IS GOOD COP, ROBOCOP. OKAY, SO WAS HE A GOOD PRESIDENT, BOTTOM LINE? WE'LL START WITH THE BOTTOM LINE AND WORK UP.
DEFINITELY TOP 50. (LAUGHTER) HE DID A LOT OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE TODAY APPRECIATE, INCLUDING DEMOCRATS. HE HEAD THE PET FAR PROGRAM ON AIDS IN AFRICA. MEDICARE PART "D" THAT PAYS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG CARE. OBVIOUSLY IRAQ SUCKS A LOT OF THE OPTION OUT OF THE ROOM.
Stephen: I'M GLAD YOU FINISHED THAT SENTENCE. (LAUGHTER) WAS HE IN CHARGE? BECAUSE THE LINE ON THESE TWO WAS THAT CHENEY WAS CALLING THE SHOTS AND THAT MY MAN BUSH WAS JUST A PUPPET.
I THINK THAT'S THE SURPRISING THING YOU LEARN FROM THIS BOOK IS IN FACT THE RELATIONSHIP IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. CHENEY WAS VERY INFLUENTIAL IN THE BEGINNING BUT AS THE TERM WENT ON THE TWO OF THEM DIVERGED AND WENT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. BY THE END THEY WERE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF MOST OF THE ISSUES THEN THEY HAD A BIG FIGHT AT THE END.
Stephen: THEY GREW APART?
THEY WERE ONS ON IT IS SIDES OF IRAN, NORTH KOREA, SYRIA, RUSSIA, CLIMATE CHANGE, GUN RIGHTS, THE AUTO BAILOUT.
Stephen: WAIT, THEY WERE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDES? SO BUSH WAS ON ONE SIDE AND CHENEY WAS ON THE OTHER ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND GUN RIGHTS AND -- WHEN DID BUSH -- WAS BUSH GAGGED? WHY -- (LAUGHTER). WHY DID I NOT HEAR ANYTHING THAT I DIDN'T LIKE FROM BUSH.
.
BUSH WON THOSE FIGHTS.
Stephen: HE DID? WHERE WAS THE GUN CONTROL BUSH INSTITUTED?
HE DIDN'T DO GUN CONTROL BUT ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT CASE BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT THE ADMINISTRATION PUT IN A MIDDLE OF-THE-ROAD BRIEF THAT CHENEY DIDN'T LIKE. HE SIGNED ON TO A DIFFERENT BRIEF SAYING THE SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTS THE RIGHTS TO GUNS AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF JOSH BOLTON WENT TO CHENEY'S CHIEF OF STAFF AND SAID "YOU CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE." HE SAID, LOOK, KHAEUBNY IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE AND HE SAID IF YOU DO THAT, TAKE YOUR STUFF AND GO UP TO THE HILL AND WORK OUT OF THERE INSTEAD OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
Stephen: IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
HE DID NOT. IN THE END HE LET HIM STAY.
Stephen: THERE'S THE DOOR, DON'T LET IT HIT YOU WHERE THE GOOD LORD SPLIT YOU." (LAUGHTER) WERE THEY EVER FRIENDS?
THEY WERE NEVER FRIENDS. I ASKED JIMMY ABOUT IT. HE SAID THEY WERE NEVER BUDDIES.
Stephen: THAT'S HEARTBREAKING! THAT'S LIKE FINDING OUT BATMAN AND ROBIN WEREN'T GAY. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) DID THEY ACTUALLY FIGHT ABOUT ANYTHING?
THEY DID BY THE END. ESPECIALLY OVER SCOOTER LIBBY. SCOOTER LIBBY WAS CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE VICE PRESIDENT. HE GOT CONVICTED IN THE C.I.A. LEAK CASE. CHENEY THOUGHT IT WAS A BOGUS PROSECUTION. BUSH SAID -- CHENEY SAID "I THINK YOU SHOULD PARDON HIM." BUSH SAID NO. CHENEY SAID "YOU'RE LEAVING A GOOD MAN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE." ON THE INAUGURATION DAY IT'S JUST BUSH AND OBAMA IN THE CAR HE SAYS "WHATEVER YOU DO, SET A PARDON POLICY EARLY AND STICK TO IT. LEARN HOW TO SAY NO TO YOUR VICE PRESIDENT."
THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS A HARD GUY TO SAY NO TO BECAUSE HE SHOT PEOPLE IN THE FACE. (LAUGHTER)
YES, BUT BUSH DID IT.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THAT CAUSED FRICTION BETWEEN TWO T OF TWO OF THEM WHEN CHENEY SHOT A MAN IN THE FACE. (LAUGHTER) IT WAS A MISTAKE. WHY WAS THAT A PROBLEM FOR THE PRESIDENT?
THEY WERE UPSET THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT DIDN'T PUT THIS OUT AT FIRST, DIDN'T DISCLOSE IT. LAURA BUSH HEARD ABOUT IT --
THE VICE PRESIDENT DIDN'T HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE AND GO "SURPRISE, I SHOT SOMEONE IN THE FACE?"
EVEN LAURA BUSH WAS UPSET. SHE HEARD ABOUT IT FROM HER SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. CAUSED MORE FRICTIONS BETWEEN TWO SIDES.
Stephen: DID CHENEY EVER -- CHENEY NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR SHOOTING EVERYONE IN THE FACE. HE DID. HE WENT ON BRIT HUME, EVENTUALLY. THE PRESIDENT --
Stephen: HE SHOT THE PRESIDENT IN THE FACE.
HE DID NOT SHOOT THE PRESIDENT IN THE FACE.
Stephen: I THOUGHT THE OTHER GUY APOLOGIZED FOR GETTING HIS FACE IN THE WAY OF CHENEY'S GUN.
HE DID. HE WAS VERY GRACIOUS ABOUT IT.
Stephen: THAT WAS NICE. I'M NOT SURE BUILD THAT GRACIOUS WITH MY FACE. PETER BAKER "DAYS OF FIRE." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
