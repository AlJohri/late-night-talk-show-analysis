WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT ISOON ACCLAIMED  TV WRITER AND DIRECTOR WHO HAS  MOVED ON TO SHAKESPEARE. THEY ALWAYS END UP SELLING OUT  FOR THE BIG BUCKS. PLEASE WELCOME JOSS WHEDON. THANKS FOR COMING ON.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen:  NICE TO MEET YOU. I'M A BIG FAN OF YOUR WORK.
AS AM I-- OF YOURS. I'M A FAN OF YOUR WORK.
Stephen:  OH, I'M A FAN OF  MY WORK AS WELL. WONDERFUL. NOW, JOSS-- NOT JOSH.
TWO Ss.
Stephen:  WHY DID YOU DROP  THE H. WHAT KIND OF NAME IS JOSS?
WELL, IT'S SORT OF A  BASTARDIZED CHINESE WORD MEANING  LUCK. IF YOU READ JAMES CLAVELL IT IS.
I READ SSHOULD, OGUN BUT  THAT'S JAPANESE.
TIPAN.
Stephen:  I DON'T READ  CHINESE. WHAT WAS YOUR NAME BEFORE IT WAS  JOSS.
IT WAS JOSEPH OR JOE OR JOEY,  WHICH IS WHY I CHANGED.
Stephen:  OKAY, CAN I CALL  YOU JOEY?
NO.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, LET'S  MOVE ON. YOU KNOW, YOU ARE THE EMMY  WINNING FILM AND TV CREATOR  PRODUCER, DIRECTOR, WRITER, COMPOSER-- COMPOSURE?
YES, OF THIS MOVIE.
Stephen:  YOUR WORK  INCLUDES BUFF, AND THE AVENGERS. THE NEW FILM IS "MUCH ADO ABOUT  NOTHING."  WHY, IF YOU'RE THE SUPER BIG  BLOCKBUSTER DIRECTOR OF THE AVENGERS, BILLION-DOLLAR MOVIE  AT LEAST, RIGHT, AT LEAST. OKAY? JUST NOD OR SOMETHING.
YES 1.5 IF WE'RE GOING TO BE  TECHNICAL.
Stephen:  YOU DIDN'T WANT  TO BRAG. $1.5 BILLION. THAT WAS $500 MILLION SHY, AND  YOU WERE KIND OF INSULTED. WHY DO YOU GO SLUMMING WITH THE  SHAKESPEARE NOW?
WELL, BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING  I LOVE VERY MUCH BECAUSE  SHAKESPEARE IS SOMETHING THAT I AND ALL THE ACTORS IN THE MOVIE,  IT'S WHAT WE GREW UP WITH. IT'S WHAT WE STUDIED.
Stephen:  IT'S OLD, THOUGH. IT'S OLD.
Stephen:  SO AM I.
Stephen:  YOU'RE NOT 400  YEARS OLD. YOU COULD WRITE SOMETHING BETTER  THAN SHAKESPEARE, RIGHT?
OH, TOTALLY.
Stephen:  YOU WROTE THE  AVENGERS, RIGHT? YOU GOT THAT THOARE, IN THERE,  HE THROWS IN THOSE THUS AND  THOUS. WHAT IS IT ABOUT SHAKESPEARE YOU  LIKE IS THERE I CAN NEVER  UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.
HOPEFULLY IF YOU SEE "MUCH  ADO ABOUT NOTHING," YOU WILL  UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. THE STUFF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT  IS VERY HUMAN, VERY MUCH WHAT  WE'RE GOING THROUGH NOW AS MODERN PEOPLE. IT'S ABOUT OUR IDENTITIES AS MEN  AND WOMEN AND IT'S MEATY FOR AN  ACTOR.
Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU MEAN  BY IDENTITY. MEN ARE MEN AND WOMEN ARE WOMEN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IDENTITY.
THERE IS THE CHARACTER OF  BEATRICE AND BENEDICT WHO ARE  THE SORT OF WARRING COUPLE WHO EVENTUALLY BECOME LOVERS AND  BEATRICE IS VERY CRITICAL OF THE  WAY SOCIETY IS RUN.
Stephen:  IS IT A "WILL  THEY OR WON'T THEY "KIND OF  THING.
IT'S THE ORIGINAL WILL THEY  OR WON'T THEY.
Stephen:  IT SOUNDS LIKE A  BUFFY ANGEL KIND OF THING?
I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE WAS  GOING FOR.
Stephen:  LET'S TAKE A LOOK  AT THIS FILM HERE, JIMMY.
BUT ARE YOU SURE BENEDICT  LOVES BEATRICE ENTIRELY. SO SAYS THE PRINCE. I PERSUADED THEM, IF THEY LOVED  BENEDICT TO WISH HIM AFFECTION.
WHY DID YOU SO. DOES NOT THE GENTLEMAN DESERVE  AS FULL AND FORTUNATE A BED AS  BEATRICE.
I KNOW HE DESERVES AS MUCH,  BUT NATURE NEVER FRAMED A  WOMAN'S HEART OF PROUDER STUFF THAN THAT OF BEATRICE.
Stephen:  I NOTICED  SOMETHING-- A, I NOTICED TWO  THINGS THERE. ONE IS THAT-- I UNDERSTAND WHAT  THEY WERE SAYING, WHICH WAS  SHOCKING TO ME. AND, SECOND, THAT'S NOT IN THE  GLOBE THEATER. WHERE ARE YOU SHOOTING THAT.
OH, THAT WAS IN MY HOUSE.
Stephen:  THE WHOLE THING  IS A TAX DODGE? WHAT DO-- WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING--  JUDGEY ARE YOU SHOOTING IN YOUR  HOUSE?
I DID START A MICROBUDGET  STUDIO WITH MY WIFE TO MAKE  LOWER BUDGET MOVIES SO THEY COULD DO WHATEVER I WANTED.
Stephen:  WHAT MICROBUDGET?
MICROBUDGET-- THERE'S LOW  BUDGET AND THEN THERE'S MICRO. IT'S THE LEAST YOU CAN MAKE A  MOVIE FOR, BASICALLY. NO, I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A  NUMBER.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, FINE,  NOT $1.5 BILLION.
NOT EVEN 1 BILLION.
Stephen:  WHY WOULD YOU LET  ANYONE SHOOT IN YOUR HOUSE. YOU KNOW WHAT CREWS CAN DO TO A  HOUSE. HOW MUCH DUNKIN' DONUTS WAS  GROUND INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM RUG  BY THE TIME THIS WAS OVER?
WE COULDN'T AFFORD DUNKIN'.
Stephen:  AMERICA RUNS ON  DUNKIN'. SO WHAT KIND OF HOUSE ARE WE  TALKING HERE? NICE PLACE?
YEAH, IT'S LOVELY. MY WIFE IS AN ARCHITECT. SHE ACTUALLY DESIGNED IT.
Stephen:  WHAT HAPPENS IN  AVENGERS 2? I'M SORRY, I JUST HAVE TO GET TO  THAT.
IT SEEMS LIKE A NATURAL  SEGUE.
Stephen:  I JUST GOTTA ASK,  WHAT HAPPENS IN AVENGERS TWO. IS STONY STARK IN THAT THAT? IN "IRON MAN THREE "HE TAKES OUT  THING IN HIS CHEST AND THAT  POWERS THE SUIT. HOW CAN HE BE IN AVENGERS 2.
THEY JUST REPLACED IT. IT'S ELSEWHERE. I CAN'T GIVE IT ALL AWAY, BUT  HE'S STILL GOT IT.
Stephen:  SO HE'S HAS AN  ATOMIC ASS. WELL, ARE YOU GOING TO DO MORE  OF THIS MICROBUDGET STUFF. IF YOU HAD YOUR DRUTHERS WHAT  WOULD BE THE NEXT THING YOU  WOULD DO THAT IS NOT THE BIGGEST BUDGET MOVIE ALL TIME.
I'D LIKE TO DO A BALLET.
Stephen:  HONEST TO PETE. HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF A SALUTE TO  WOMEN'S WATER BOTTLES. JOSS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. JOSS WHEDON. THE MOVIE IS "MUCH ADO ABOUT  NOTHING."  IT'S A BIG DEAL ABOUT SOMETHING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
