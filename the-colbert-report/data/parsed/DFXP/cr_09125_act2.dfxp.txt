Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  FOLKS. THANKS SO MUCH, FOLKS. IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW YOU  KNOW THAT AS A PROTECTOR OF  OUR NATIONAL MORAL VIRTUE, I HAVE LONG BEMOANED THE  OVERSEXUALIZATION OF OUR  CULTURE. AND THEN I BEMOANED MY  BEMOANING, BECAUSE SOME OF  IT SOUNDED PRETTY SEXY. WELL FOR ONCE, FOLKSING I'M  NOT THE ONLY ELDERLY PERSON  YELLING AT THE YOUNGSTERS TO GET OFF MY LOIN. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE I HAVE GOT THE OLD  GRAY LADY ON MY SIDE. YOU SEE, OVER THE WEEKEND  "THE NEW YORK TIMES"  PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE TITLED  SEX ON CAMPUS, SHE CAN PLAY THAT GAME TOO. TEARING ITS LID OFF THE  BREAKING NEWS STORY THAT  WOMEN IN COLLEGE, BRACE  YOURSELVES, ENJOY THE SEX. (LAUGHTER)  NOW I'LL GIVE YOU-- I WILL  GIVE YOU A MOMENT WHILE YOUR  MINDS AND ONLY YOUR MINDS ARE BLOWN. (LAUGHTER)  NOW AS THE ARTICLE NOTES,  FOLKS, AS THE ARTICLE NOTES  TRADITIONAL DATING IN COLLEGE HAS MOSTLY GONE THE  WAY OF THE LAND LINE  REPLACED BY HOOKING UP. AND THERE'S AN INCREASING  REALIZATION THAT YOUNG WOMEN  ARE PROPELLING IT. NOW FOR THOSE NOT HIP TO THE  SCENE, THE PHRASE "HOOKING  UP" IS TEEN TALK FOR ANY SEX YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE HAVING. EVIDENTLY, USING PROPELLERS. NOW NATION THIS IS TRULY  SHOCKING. THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN EXPOSE  LIKE THIS SINCE THE FRONT  LINE DOCUMENTARY SERIES ON HOW WILD ARE GIRLS HAVE  GONE. BEFORE THIS "NEW YORK TIMES"  EXCLUSIVE STORY, I THOUGHT  ONLY GUYS HAD SEX IN  COLLEGE. I MEAN--   (LAUGHTER)  ISN'T THAT WHAT FRATS ARE  FOR? I MEAN GO CAPA ALPHA. I HAVE TO SAY, I HAVE TO SAY  I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT "NEW  YORK TIMES" NAILED THIS  TREND. I WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS  FROM THE PAPER THAT ALSO  NAILED THE SHOCKING EVIDENCE OF COLLEGE SEX IN 2012, 2010,  2008, 1997, 1988, 1976, 1972,  1968, 1967, 1963. AND IN 1940 WHEN  AN-- CLUCKED ABOUT THE SEX  RELATIONS BETWEEN THE  STUDENTS AND COEDUCATIONAL  COLLEGES. YES. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YES, YES, THE  SEX RELATIONS. (APPLAUSE)  THE SEX RELATIONS, AS  DISTURBING TODAY AS IT WAS  THEN, BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOW YOUR GRANDPARENTS. (LAUGHTER)  AND WHO, WHO AMONG US CAN  FORGET 1904 WHEN ACTUAL  TIMES WRITER HENRY MITCHELL McCROCKEN, BROTHER OF PHIL  McKRAKEN, I BELIEVE, WROTE A  SCATHING EXPOSE ON RISK SURROUNDING COLLEGE MEN IN  BIG CITIES, NAMELY THE  LOWEST GRADE OF IMPULSES  FROM THE SEXUAL PRO PENSION. OH, OH MY GOODNESS. OH GOODNESS ME. (APPLAUSE)  GOODNESS, MY BILLUOUS HUMORS  HAVEN'T BEEN SO BASELY  AROUSED SINCE I GLIMPSE THAT DEGUERO TYPE OF A-- QUICK,  QUESTION, A FINK TURE OF  MERCURY WILL REHABILITATE MY  CONSTITUTION. YOU SEE, YOU SEE, FOLKS,  BACK-- LATER WE'RE DOING THE  MACADO. YOU SEE, NATION N 1904 NO  ONE HAD DEARED PLUMB THE  DEPTHS OF A YOUNG MAN'S AM  OROUS PROCLIVITIES MAINLY BECAUSE "THE NEW YORK TIMES"  WANT FOUNDED UNTIL 1851 AND  SEX WASN'T INVENTED UNTIL  1893.
