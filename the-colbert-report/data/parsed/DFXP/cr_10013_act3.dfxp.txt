Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS PLAYED AN ELF, A PIRATE AND NOW ROMEO ON BROADWAY. HE CAN ACT IN ANYTHING AS LONG AS HE'S WEARING TIGHTS. PLEASE WELCOME ORLANDO BLOOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD TO SEE YOU. WHAT A PLEASURE, LOVE HAVING YOU ON, MAN.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON, MAN.
Stephen: I'M A HUGE FAN.
ME OF YOU, TOO, BRO.
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M GOING TO CHOOSE TO BELIEVE YOU.
(LAUGHS) DO! I'M AN ACTOR, I'M VERY GOOD AT LYING.
Stephen: THAT'S ALL ACTORS DO. LET'S TALK ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING GOING ON WITH YOU RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, LET ME KNOW, OKAY? ALL I'M GOING TO SAY IS THERE ARE A LOT OF FISH IN THE SEA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU'RE A GOOD LOOKING GUY. LET'S MOVE ON. RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ON BROADWAY IN "ROMEO AND JULIET."
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: NOW WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THEATER? (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE A GODDAMN MOVIE STAR. (LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE I'M A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT.
Stephen: REALLY. YOU COULD SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN A GIANT GREEN ROOM TALKING TO TWO PING-PONG BALLS GLUED TO A GREEN STICK. SO WHAT IS IT THAT DREW YOU TO DOING LIVE THEATER? YOU'VE BEEN PART OF SOME BLOCKBUSTERS.
I HAVE BEEN. BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO ACT WITH OTHER ACTORS AS OPPOSED TO --
Stephen: SOME PEOPLE.
I WANTED TO HAVE FLESH AND BLOOD IN FRONT OF ME AND COMMUNICATE WITH THEM.
Stephen: IS IT EASY FOR YOU TO DO THE IAMBIC PENTAMETER? BECAUSE THAT'S HOW ALL YOU PEOPLE TALK?
WHAT IS THAT? OH, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SHAKESPEARE.
Stephen: THE DA-DA-DA-DA --
IT'S LIKE A BIG SAFETY NET, ACTUALLY, IN TRUTH. ONCE YOU GET INTO THAT RHYTHM IT'S KIND OF LIKE -- IT GIVES YOU THE GROOVE.
Stephen: DID YOU GROW UP TALKING LIKE THAT OVER IN ENGLAND.
I DID!
Stephen: MAMA I'D LIKE SOME SOUP TODAY. (LAUGHTER)
PLEASE MAY I HAVE SOME SERIAL MY MOM. MOM, PLEASE --
, THAT WENT ON TOO LONG.
Stephen: YOU ENDED WITH A CHOKY.
I ENDED WITH A CHOKY. I CAN'T BELIEF YOU GOT THAT BEFORE ME!
Stephen: I JUST MADE THAT UP. (LAUGHTER) I HAVE TO ASK YOU AT LEAST ONE HO +BT QUESTION. I SORRY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JUST ONE. NOW YOU'RE LEGOLAS, OBVIOUSLY, THE SON OF THRANDUIL IN MERKWOOD. NOW I NOTICED IN THE TRAILER-- THAT'S ALL I KNOW-- THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING SOMETHING GOING ON WE ADVANTAGE LINE LILY AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP GOING ON.
BUT WE'RE TALKING ELF THINGS SO IT'S VERY PROFOUND AND UNSPOKEN.
Stephen: ORLANDO, YOU KNOW HOW YOU MAKE BABY ELVES, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) RIGHT?
THEY'RE ACTUALLY BORN OF THE PLANET, I THINK. YOU WOULD TELL ME, RIGHT?
Stephen: THEY WAKE UP AROUND LAKE COOIVANAN.
I TOLD YOU!
Stephen: BUT LEGOLAS ISENDARIN AND SHE'S NOT.
IT'S A REAL PROBLEM, IT'S LIKE "ROMEO AND JULIET". THE GUYS AND THE GIRLS FROM THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS. SHE'S THE GIRL FROM THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS IN THIS CASE. CASE.
Stephen: OR THE WRONG SIDE OF THE RIVER.
PROBABLY THE WRONG SIDE OF THE RIVER. OR THE LAKE OR FOREST. (LAUGHS) (SNORTS).
Stephen: IS THIS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU'VE UPDATED --
I JUST SNORTED.
Stephen: YOU DID!
I CAN DO THAT AGAIN FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE.
IT'S A VERY EL  +FEN THING TO DO.
LET'S GO BACK TO "ROMEO AND JULIET". ARE YOU UPDATED? ARE YOU IN TIGHTS OR IS THIS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IT'S --
I WEAR TIGHTS UNDER MY JEANS. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: SO IT'S JEANS AND I UNDERSTAND YOU DRIVE A MOTORCYCLE.
I DO.
Stephen: IS IT SWORDS OR CHAIN FIGHTS.
IT'S KNIVES.
Stephen: OH, REALLY? YOU KNOW WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE? "WEST SIDE STORY." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU SHOULD DO THAT SOMETIME.
I SHOULD HAVE BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE THE IAMBIC PENTAMETER AND I WAS MISSING THAT. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: YOU'VE BEEN PART OF HUGE FRANCHISES HERE. OBVIOUSLY "LORD OF THE RINGS" AND "PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEANS." ALL THE "OF THES" YOU'VE BEEN PART OF. ANY CHANCE FOR A SEQUEL ON THIS ONE?
IT COULD BE, YEAH. WELL, I DID GO FOR A -- WE DID DO A LITTLE ALTERATION ON THE END OF THE PLAY BECAUSE THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY. BECAUSE ALL I DO IS TRILOGIES. (LAUGHTER) TRILOGIES OR SEQUELS SO WHEN I SIGNED UP TO DO BROADWAY I SAID THE ONLY WAY I DO THIS IS IF WE AGREE TO CHANGE THE ENDING. I HAVE THAT MUCH POWER THAT THEY SAID YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO'VE SEEN WHITE THINK THEY KNOW HOW IT ENDS THEY SHOULD COME ON.
PEOPLE DON'T SEE SHAKESPEARE AND WHEN THEY DO THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ANYWAY, THAT WAS MY ARGUMENT.
Stephen: IT IS REALLY CHANGED?
YES.
Stephen: (LAUGHS) WELL, I MIGHT ACTUALLY SEE IT NOW. BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU THAT I SAW IT AND LOVED IT BUT IT WAS A LIE. I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET.
WELL, THAT WAS MY TEST. YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T SEE IT?
Stephen: NO, I SAW IT. NO, NO, I'M JUST (BLEEP)ING WITH YOU. I SAW IT.
Stephen: .
DID YOU SEE IT OR DIDN'T SEE IT?
Stephen: I DID.
SO YOU LIKED THE ENDING.
Stephen: I DIDN'T SEE IT. ORLANDO BLOOM, "ROMEO AND JULIET" LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND
