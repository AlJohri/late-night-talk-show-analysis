Stephen: WELCOME REPORT TO,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. PLEASE. PLEASE --  THANK YOU FOR JOIN US. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND OUT  THERE AND A SPECIAL GOOD EVENING  TO WHATEVER POOR STAFF IS DOWN AT COMEDY CENTRAL AND LOGGING  ALL THE LITTLE CLIPS FOR MY SHOW  RIGHT NOW. IT'S A HORRIBLE JOB. GET OUT OF THERE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. NATION, IT'S HARD TO GET THROUGH  THE NOISE OF WASHINGTON, D.C. BUT LAST NIGHT NAME AN EPIC  STAND ON THE SENATE FLOOR BY  LIBERTARIAN SENATOR RAND PAUL.
TO WASHINGTON WE GO NOW WHERE  A BIT OF A RARITY TAKING PLACE  TODAY, REPUBLICAN SENATOR RAND PAUL KENTUCKY RIGHT NOW  FILIBUSTERING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S  CHOICE FOR C.I.A. DIRECTOR JOHN  BRENNAN. SENATOR PAUL SAID HE WILL TALK  UNTIL HE NO LONGER CAN. YOU TALK AND TALK TO PREVENT A  VOTE.
Stephen: TALKING AND  TALKING AND TALKING TO FILL  HOURS OF EMPTY TIME. [LAUGHTER] IT'S THE STORY CABLE NEWS WAS  BORN TO COVER. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, SENATOR PAUL STARTED HIS  FILIBUSTER IN RESPONSE TO THE  ANSWER HE RECEIVED FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER TO THIS  QUESTION:
CAN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CARRY  OUT DRONE STRIKES AGAINST  AMERICAN CITIZENS ON U.S. SOIL?
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, ERIC  HOLDER, HAS MADE A SURPRISING  STATEMENT, YES BUT ONLY UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCESES.
Stephen: LIKE AN ENDLESS  WAR WITH A FACELESS ENEMY FOUGHT  BY REMOTE CONTROL FLYING  KILLBOTS. HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN? [LAUGHTER] THE FIRST QUESTION WAS AL QAEDA  ENEMY COMBATANT. OVER THE COURSE OF THE 13  STRAIGHT HOURS HE RAISED A  SLIPPERY SLOPE QUESTION THE ANSWER TO WHICH HE RECEIVED THIS  AFTERNOON.
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS  RESPONDED WITH A LETTER FROM  ATTORNEY GENERAL HOLDER TO RAND  PAUL. I'M QUOTING, IT HAS COME TO MY  ATTENTION YOU'VE ASKED:  DOES  THE PRESIDENT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO USE AID WEAPONNIZED DRONE TO  KILL AN AMERICAN NOT -- THE  ANSWER IS NO.
THERE WAS ONE OF SHORTEST  LETTERS FROM AN ATTORNEY GENERAL  AND IT HAD A SILENT FU IN THERE  SOMEWHERE.
Stephen: F-U, OF COURSE  STANDS FOR THANK YOU FOR IS  ASKING. I WANT TO THANK RAND PAUL FOR  MAKING THIS BRAVE STANCE BECAUSE  IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THEY CANNOT KILL US. I'M SURE THERE'S NOT CLASSIFIED  LEGAL OPINION OVERRIDING THAT  ONE LIKE WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT. DOESN'T CHANGE MY OPINION. NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAYS, I  LOVE DRONES. [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU HEAR THAT DRONES? STEPHEN LOVES YOU! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] STEPHEN, LOVES DRONES, DRONES,  WITH PRETTY FACE DRONES. NATION, YOU KNOW WHEN I TAKE TO  THE AIRWAVES I EXPECT THE ENTIRE  WORLD TO BE LISTENING AND I MEAN THE ENTIRE WORLD. WOULD IT KILL YOU TO GET HULU  PLUS PEOPLE OF RAINFOREST? [LAUGHTER] BUT I HAVE A SPECIAL INTEREST IN  NORTH KOREANS WHO I ASSUME ARE  WATCHING ON THEIR TELEVISION  SETS. THIS WEEK LOS KOREANS DEL NORTE  THREATED TO USE A MISSILE ON THE  U.S. AND YOU KNOW THEY MEAN BUSINESS  THEY WIPED EAST AND WEST KOREA  OFF THE MAP. [  APPLAUSE  ] I ALSO CLAP WHEN I'M TERRIFIED. WITH TENSIONS RISING AMERICA HAD  NO CHOICE BUT TO SEND THEIR TOP  NEGOTIATOR DENNIS RODMAN FOR SOME BASKETBALL DIPLOMACY. AFTER ALL IT WORKED AT THE  CONFERENCE WITH STALIN. HE BACKED DOWN PRETTY QUICK  AFTER GETTING TOMAHAWK DUNKED ON  BY FDR. [LAUGHTER] WE LEARNED IT FAILED.
