[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK  MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A SUPREME  COURT JUSTICE, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT THAT'S A PRETTY  BIG DEAL TO ME  PLEASE WELCOME JUSTICE SONIA  SOTOMAYOR! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
I'M REALLY DELIGHTED TO BE  HERE.
Stephen: DO YOU GUYS WHEN  YOU COME OUT IN YOUR ROBES, DO  YOU EVER GET A RESPONSE LIKE THAT FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY?
NEVER.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO GET  YOURSELVES LIKE A PUMPING SONG  OR SOMETHING. A KICKIN BASS BEAT OR SOMETHING  TO COME OUT THERE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN YURK  SUPREME COURT JUSTICES -- MAYBE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DO YOU KNOW THAT WHEN I WAS  SWORN IN, THE SECURITY OFFICERS  THREATENED TO EJECT ANYONE FROM THE ROOM WHO CLAPPED.
Stephen: REALLY?
THEY SCARED MY FAMILY SO MUCH  THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY  ENTIRE LIFE THEY STAYED SILENT.
Stephen: WOW, SO YOU ARE  NOT TO ENJOY YOURSELF AT THE  SUPREME COURT? DO YOU ENJOY YOURSELF AT THE  SUPREME COURT?
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE  PRETTY FUNNY. OCCASIONALLY WE DO LAUGH.
Stephen: WHO IS THE  FUNNIEST?
OH, NO, I'M NEVER GOING TO  PICK AMONG A COLLEAGUE. THERE'S AN ARTICLE THAT MEASURES  THE NUMBER OF LAUGHS. I'M PRETTY LOW ON THAT SCALE.
Stephen: REALLY? IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE. AN HONOR TO HAVE A SITTING  SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WITH US. NO FAN OF LIBERAL JUDICIAL  ACTIVISM, I WANT YOU TO KNOW  THAT. I'M A FAN OF SELLING THINGS AND  YOU'VE GOT A BOOK YOU ARE  PUSHING RIGHT NOW. SONYA SOAT MAYOR, "MY BELOVED  WORLD."  THIS SAY VERY REVEALING PORTRAIT  OF WHERE YOU GREW UP IN THE  BRONX. WHY DO WE NEED TO KNOW THIS MUCH  ABOUT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES? BECAUSE IT USED TO BE NINE SORT  OF FACELESS WHITE GUYS OUT THERE  AND AMERICA RAN GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN FOR THE MOST PART, HERE  OR THERE.
HERE OR THERE, DRED SCOTT.
Stephen: YEAH, WHATEVER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU ALWAYS SAY DRED SCOTT. NOW HOW DID YOUR CHILDHOOD  GROWING UP IN THE BRONX  INFLUENCE YOUR JOB NOW?
I DON'T KNOW IF IT INFLUENCES  MY JOB NOW, BUT IT'S MADE THE  PERSON I AM. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE  WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THAT. I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT  MESSAGE OF THE BOOK IS, NO,  WE'RE NOT NINE FACELESS PEOPLE. WE'RE NINE HUMAN BEINGS AND EACH  OF US WITH OUR OWN STORY AND  EACH OF US AN ORDINARY HUMAN BEING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB  AT TIMES. WE'RE STILL PEOPLE. I WANTED EVERYONE WHO READ THIS  BOOK -- BECAUSE I KNOW MOST  PEOPLE SHARE AN EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD OR FEELING I'VE HAD ABOUT AN  EXPERIENCE -- THAT EVERYONE WHO  READ IT COULD ULTIMATELY COME OUT AND SAY SOMETHING LIKE, "YOU  KNOW SHE'S JUST LIKE ME. AND IF SHE CAN REACH HER DREAMS,  I CAN REACH MINE." [  APPLAUSE  ]
Stephen: YOU GREW UP POOR. YOUR FATHER DIED WHEN YOU WERE  NINE. YOU HAD TO LOOK AFTER YOURSELF A  FAIR AMOUNT. YOU HAD EVEN HAD TO INJECT YOUR  OWN INSULIN AS A CHILD WITH  DIABETES. YOU ARE SO SELF RELIANT. THAT SEEMS LIKE A VALUE THAT  CONSERVATIVES EMBRACE ALL THE  TIME. WHY AREN'T YOU A REPUBLICAN IF  YOU BELIEVE IN SELF RELIANCE.
HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT?
Stephen: BECAUSE OBAMA  APPOINTED YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE ONLY LITMUS TEST I  NEED. [LAUGHTER] I'M NOT A SENATOR. YOU CAN'T WALK AROUND ME.
SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH TO YOU  I'M NOT A DEMOCRAT. I'M INDEPENDENT. REGISTERSREGISTERS TO NO PARTY.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE MOST  CONSERVATIVE BELIEF YOU HAVE? [LAUGHTER]
I BELIEVE IN THE  CONSTITUTION. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT? THEN I BELIEVE YOU ARE NOT A  DEMOCRAT. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. I GOT A BEEF WITH YOU --
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE ALL  SHARE COMMON VALUES.
Stephen: NOT ALL OF US  BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION. THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS NEVER TO  BE QUESTIONED. DO YOU BELIEVE WE HAVE THE RIGHT  TO HAVE ANY WEAPON WE WANT.
WELL, YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON  ENOUGH WHEN THE CASE COMES UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: THIS IS WHAT I  LIKE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW SWEET IS THAT LIFETIME  THING? [LAUGHTER] HOW LONG BEFORE YOU JUST START  PHONING IT IN? [LAUGHTER]
NEVER. THERE ISN'T A JUSTICE AND NOT  ONE THAT I KNOW IN THE HISTORY  OF OUR COURTS THAT HASN'T CARED PASSIONATELY ABOUT WHAT HE OR  SHE IS OR HAS DONE ON THE COURT. I DON'T EVER EXPECT ANYBODY TO  PHONE IT IN.
Stephen: WHEN YOU GO TO THE  BRONX AND YOU SEE A YOUNG GIRL  ON A PLAYGROUND THERE DO YOU THINK THAT CHILD HAS THE SAME  OPPORTUNITIES I HAD WHEN I WAS A  CHILD? [LAUGHTER] THE KIDS DEGREING UP IN THE  BRONX NOW?
WELL, A PIECE OF ME WOULD  WANT HER TO BECOME A JUSTICE  INSTEAD OF A PERSON ON TELEVISION, BECAUSE OUTSIDE OF  THAT --
Stephen: THAT WAS ME SAYING  OPPORTUNITIES I HAVE -- I WAS  BEING YOU.
I WAS WONDERING, I TOOK YOU  LITERALLY.
Stephen: YEAH, NO I WAS IN  CHARACTER.
OH.
Stephen: I APOLOGIZE.
YOU MEAN THIS IS NOT REALLY  YOU?
Stephen: NO THIS IS ME. A SECOND AGO I WAS PLAYING THE  CHARACTER OF YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] YOUR HONOR, I MOVE WE ADJOURN. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: JUSTICE SOAT  MAYOR. THE BOOK IS -- JUSTICE SONYA  SOAT --  JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR, "MY  BELOVED WORLD."
