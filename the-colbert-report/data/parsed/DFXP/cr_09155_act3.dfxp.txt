( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A RESEARCHER. YOU NEVER WANT TO HEAR HIM SAY, "WILL YOU BE MY CHUM?" PLEASE WELCOME CHRIS FISHER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen:  MR. FISHER, DR. FISHER?
CHRIS.
Stephen:  CHRIS.
STEVEIN. PLEASURE.
Stephen:  GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU ARE THE FOUNDER OF O-SEARCH A SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATION THAT TRACKS SHARK WITH THE AIMS OF PROTECT WILL THEM.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen:  WHY WOULD I WANT SOMEONE TO PROTECT A SHARK? IT'S KILL OR BE KILLED. LAW OF THE WATER JUNGLE.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT IF WE DON'T LOVE ON OUR SHARKS, THEY'RE THE LIONS OF THE OCEAN. THEY KEEP EVERYTHING IN ORDER. IF WE MOVE THEM FROM THE SYSTEM, THE WHOLE SYSTEM WILL COLLAPSE.
Stephen:  WE ALREADY HAVE LIONS OF THE OCEAN. THEY'RE CALLED SEA LIONS.
WE DON'T WANT TOO MANY SEA LION.
Stephen:  WHY?
BECAUSE THEY'LL EAT ALL THE BAIT AND FISH AND THEN WE'LL HAVE NOTHING TO CARB WITH.
IF WE LOSE OUR SHARKS WE LOSE THE OCEAN.
Stephen:  HOW DO WE KEEP THE SHARKS DOWN. YOU HAVE TO ADMIT. YOU IF WE DON'T KEEP THE POPULATION OF SHARKS DOWN, THERE COULD BE A SHARK NATO. WE NEED LOSS OF SHARKS. WHO IS KEEPING THEM DOWN RIGHT NOW?
RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOSING 2,000 A DAY TO THING.
Stephen:  WAIT AIR, DAY? 200,000 A DAY? HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED BY SHARKS A DAY, 400,000?
ZERO. JUST A COUPLE A YEAR.
Stephen:  SO WE'RE WIN BEING. SO THAT'S THE BRIGHT SIDE. I THINK WE HAVE SOME FOLK OF PHOTOS OF, THATS UP HERE, THROOBS OF THERE'S-- WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE. YOU ME A WHITE THAT NEEDS A NEW BRANDING AGENT.
Stephen:  LET'S LOOK AT SOME FRIENDLIER PHOTOS OF THE WHITE SHARK. THERE GU. THIS IS OUR EMAGE OF THE WHITE SHARK. WHAT SHOULD MY IMAGE OF THE WHITE SHARK BE, CUTE AND CUDDLY. JUST TELL US ARE THEY LOVERS OR FIGHTERS. FIGHTERS. >>IC IT'S LIKE A FIGHTER YOU HAVE TO RESPECT. THAT'S A SHARK KILLING A SEAL.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED THEM TO BE DOING.
Stephen:  YOU'RE A CONSERVIST. WHAT DOES DSEALS EVER DO DO YOU? DID ONE BEAT YOU UP IN HIGH SCHOOL?
I HAVE HAD THEM COME DOWN AND TAKE OVER MY SHARKS.
YOU SAY THEY'RE BEING KILLED FOR FINS. WHY DO YOU WANT JUST SOUP, PRESS SIEGE, A $100 BOWL OF SOUP. AS THE.
Stephen:  WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PROTECT THEM?
WE HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THEY LIFE AND GIVE BIRTH. WE'RE CAPTURING THE MASSIVE SHARKS, USE OF LETTING SCIENTISTS USE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF YOUR LIVES. WE CAN LOOK AT THE BREATHING SIDE. WE CAN LOOK AT THE BABY SHARKS IN THE NURSERY. BELIEVE IT OR NOT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THOSE PLACES ARE? WE DON'T KNOW WHERE SHARKS HAVE THEIR BABIES?
NOT OF NO, WE DO NOT. WHO THE THE WHITE SHARK. AS SOON AS WE FIND THAT POLICE. WE'RE PUTTING A HOSE INTO THE MOUTH OF THE SHARK. THIS IS WHAT IS LEFT ON THE BOAT TO KILL YOU.
WE BROUGHT IT IN AND WE'LL REVIEW 12 RESEARCH PROJECTS 15 MINUTES AFTER TIME WE HAVE. EVERYBODY CAN TRACK THEM ONLINE OPINION.
Stephen:  WHERE DO THEY GO?
CAPE COD SHARK OUT OF THE NORTHEAST AND LIVE IN THE SOUTHEAST.
Stephen:  I'M FROM THE SOUTHEAST. IF A 4,000.
Stephen:  WERE THERE GREAT WHEETS OUT THERE.
THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE SWIMMING AROUND FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS.
Stephen:  FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS. HOW LONG HAVE SHARKS BEEN ON EARTH.
Stephen:  OVER 400 MILLION YEARS.
Stephen:  BUT THAT YOU WERE HERE WITH THE DINOSAURS.
Stephen:  THEY DID, AND THEY HAD A VERY GOOD RUN. OPEFULLY THAT RUN WILL CO CONTINUE.
Stephen:  DO WE KNOW HOW OLD SHARKS GET? THEY GET TO BE ABOUT 7200, AND THEY WON'T.
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. SHARK CONSERVIST CHRIS FISHER FROM OCEARCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
