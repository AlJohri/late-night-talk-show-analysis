Stephen: TONIGHT THIS  YEAR'S NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS  ARE ANNOUNCED. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHICH  ECONOMIST WON THE SWIMSUIT  COMPETITION. THEN AN CUP DATE ABOUT A  CRIMINAL LOOSE IN FLORIDA,  THAT'S RIGHT, I'M ON TO YOU,  HALF OF FLORIDA. AND MY GUEST EVAN THOMAS HAS  A NEW BOOK THAT SAYS DWIGHT  D EISENHOWER WAS THE FATHER  OF MODERN NUCLEAR POLICY. THAT WE KNOW OF. THE INVENTOR OF THE  CARDBOARD BIKE SAYS IT WILL  CHANGE THE WORLD. PROVIDED THAT CHANGE  INCLUDES NEVER RAINING  AGAIN. THIS IS "THE COLBERT  REPORT."
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY, GOOD TO  HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU,  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SOP MUCH. I'M NOT SURE, I'M SO  THRILLED BY THAT OVATION BUT  I'M NOT SURE WHETHER YOU ARE  ACTUALLY CLAPPING FOR ME OR JUST TRYING TO SHAKE ALL THE  RAIN OFF YOUR ARMS. BUT FOLKS, YOU KNOW ME. I LOVE SEEING MANKIND  OVERCOME OBSTACLES. THAT'S WHY I'M ALWAYS  PUSHING CHAIRS IN FRONT OF  PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER)  AND YESTERDAY, ANOTHER  BARRIER FELL AS DAREDEVIL  FELIX BAUMGARTNER BECAME THE  FIRST MAN TO-- AAAAHHHH--  (LAUGHTER)  FELIX BAUMGARTNER BECAME THE  FIRST MAN TO BREAK THE SOUND  BARRIER IN FREEFALL. PARACHUTING FROM A RECORD  ALTITUDE OF 24 MILES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS  PROVES THAT OUR DAYS OF  HUMAN EXPLORATION ARE NOT  OVER. BECAUSE WE DID IT! WE PUT A MAN ON THE EARTH! (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IT'S A BRAVE SAME WORLD. (LAUGHTER)  AND FOLKS, MILLIONS AROUND  THE WORLD TUNED IN TO  WITNESS THIS HISTORIC EVENT  AND OR HIDEOUSLY GRUESOME  DEATH. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THE REAL VICTORY HERE  WENT NOT TO THE MAN WHO  PLUMMETED FROM THE  MESSOSPHERE WITHOUT BEING TURNED INTO A FACE SUIT FULL  OF WET DOG FOOD, NO. THE DAY TRULY BELONGED TO  HIS CORPORATE SPONSOR, RED  BULL. IT'S PERFECT SYNERGY. RED BULL GIVES YOU WINGS. AND BAUMGARTNER FLU TOWARD  THE IS UNLIKE ICHERUS. I NEVER FINISHED THAT STORE  EVEN. HE HAD A PARACHUTE, RIGHT,  HE DID? FOLKS, WE NEED MORE PRIVATE  COMPANIES STEPPING UP TO  EXPLORE THE KNOWN  UNIVERSITY. HOW ELSE WILL WE FIND  EVIDENCE OF LIFE CEREAL ON  MARS. NOW NATION, IF YOU KNOW ME,  YOU KNOW I'M NOT BIG ON  GOSSIP. BECAUSE BETWEEN YOU AND ME,  GOSSIP IS A TWO-FACED-- THIS  IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF  THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, I HAVE NEVER LIKED  THE NOBEL PRIDESES. ANY GOLD COIN THAT BIG  SHOULD HAVE CHOCOLATE  INSIDE. (LAUGHTER)  AND THIS YEAR IS NO  EXCEPTION. THE NOBEL IN LITERATURE GOES  TO CHINESE NOVELLIST MO  YAWN. HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO GET  THROUGH RED SORE GUME? THE MO I READ THE MO I YAWN. AND TONIGHT--   (LAUGHTER)  I AM AWARDING THE WAG OF MY  FINGER TO NORWAY FOR WHO  THEY SELECTED TO WIN THE PEACE PRIZE.
THE NOBEL COMMITTEE HAS  DECIDED THAT THE NOBEL PEACE  PRIZE FOR 2012 IS TO BE  AWARDED TO THE EUROPEAN  UNION.
Stephen: OH, WHAT A SHOCK! CONGRATULATIONS, EUROPE. YOU GAVE YOURSELF THE NOBEL  PEACE PRIZE. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S THE SAME HUMILITY  OPRAH SHOWED WHEN TAKING HER  MAGAZINE COVER MOD-- WHEN  PICKING HER MAGAZINE COVER  MODEL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOBEL COMMITTEE CHAIR  THORBORN JAGLUND EXPLAINED  THEIR RATIONALE.
THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS  HELPED TO TRANSFORM MOST OF  EUROPE FROM A CONTINENTAL  WAR TO A CONTINENTAL PEACE.
Stephen: OH BRAVO,  EUROPE. SO WELL DESERVED. AFTER ALL, IT'S BEEN A WHOLE  13 YEARS SINCE YOUR LAST  GENOCIDE. BY THIS LOGIC, BY THIS LOGIC,  I SHOULD GET THE NOBEL PRIZE  FOR NOT MURDERING ANYONE  LATELY. OH, THAT'S RIGHT. I'M NO LONGER ELIGIBLE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT SINCE POLITICAL UNIONS  CAN NOW WIN NOBELS THESE  DAYS I'VE GOT TO ASK, HOW  ABOUT ONE FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE I SEE--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YEAH! BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT  YOU, I SEEM TO REMEMBER  SOMEONE PUTTING AN END TO A  COUPLE OF DUSTUPS THAT EUROPE STARTED. WHAT WERE THEY CALLED AGAIN? OH YEAH, WORLD WAR I AND  WORLD WAR II. NO BIGGIE! WE HAD PLENTY OF FREE TIME  DIGGING OURSELVES OUT OF THE  GREAT DEPRESSION. OH, AND WHO SPENT BILLIONS  ON MILITARY BASE ALL OVER  EUROPE TO KEEP THE  COMMUNISTS FROM BOOT  STOMPING YOUR WAFEL FANS AND VESPA DEALERSHIPS? OH YEAH, OH YEAH, WE DID! THAT'S WHEN YOU STEPPED UP  AND CALLED ON US AGAIN. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU  SHOULD HAVE CALLED NORWAY. YOU SEEM TO BE ON GREAT  TERMS WITH THOSE GUYS. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE THE UNITED STATES WILL  JUST TAKE THE NEXT GLOBAL  CONFLICT OFF. KEEP US AND OUR MASSIVE  PEACEKEEPING MILITARY AT  HOME. MAYBE GIVE OURSELVES A  PEOPLE'S CHOICE AWARD. (LAUGHTER)  AFTER ALL, WE HAVEN'T HAD A  WAR SINCE 1945, THAT WE'VE  DECLARED. (LAUGHTER)  NEXT UP ON THE-- FOLK, WHILE  I'M NO FAN OF VEGETATION I  BELIEVE OUR SCHOOLS CAN  TEACH OUR CHILDREN ONE THING. IT CAN TEACH THEM THEIR  PLACE IN SOCIAL PECKING  ORDER. BECAUSE THE TABLE YOU SIT AT  FOR LUNCH IS THE TABLE  YOU'LL SIT AT FOR THE REST  OF YOUR LIFE. I SAT WITH THE MOST POPULAR  GROUP. THE AV CLUB. AND NOW I WORK IN BOTH AUDIO  AND VIDEO. BUT A NEW BIT OF LIBERAL  SOCIAL ENGINEERING IS  THREATENING THE NATURAL  ORDER.
IT'S CALLED MIX IT UP AT  LUNCH DAY. OCTOBER 30th IS THE DAY, IT  ENCOURAGES KIDS TO SIT WITH  CLASSMATES THAT THEY  NORMALLY WOULDN'T TALK TO. MIX IT UP AT LUNCH IS ABOUT  BREAKING UP CLIQUES.
DON'T FALL FOR IT, KIDS. MIX IT UP AT LUNCH DAY IS AN  ATTEMPT TO ERASE ALL THE  PROPER SOCIAL BOUNDARIES. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST  JOCKS SITTING WITH NERDS BUT  ALSO SITTING WITH DORKS AND  LOSERS AND LAMOS AND SPAZS. (LAUGHTER)  AND FOR WHAT, MUTUAL  UNDERSTANDING? THAT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT SOME  TWERP FROM THE MODDLE U.N. WOULD SAY. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A BIG  TIP OF MY HAT TO THE  CONSERVATIVE EVANGELICAL  GROUP AMERICAN FAMILY  ASSOCIATION FOR SEEING THROUGH THIS PLAN.
THIS YEAR THE PROGRAM  THOUGH IS BEING TARGETED BY  THE AMERICAN FAMILY  ASSOCIATION, A CONSERVATIVE EVAN GEL CALL GROUP SAYING  THE PROJECT IS THIS, A QUOTE  NATIONWIDE PUSH TO PROMOTE  THE HOMOSEXUAL LIFESTYLE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
Stephen: EXACTLY. OH YEAH, OH YEAH, OH YEAH,  WAKE UP, EVERYBODY. MIX IT UP DAY PROMOTES THE  HOMOSEXUAL LIFESTYLE. IT'S ADAM AND EVE, NOT ADAM  AND DWEEB. IT'S A DEVIOUS PLOT. GET KIDS TO LEARN THAT  DESPITE OUR OUTWARD  DIFFERENCES IN OUR HEARTS  WE'RE ALL PRETTY OF THE  SAME. THAT LEADS TO OPEN MINDEDNESS,  WHICH LEADS TO OPEN  PANTEDNESS. AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,  TIMMY AND BOBBY ARE MAKING  MONKEY BUTTER. THAT'S THE PC TERM THESE  DAYS. THAT'S THE TERM YOU ARE  SUPPOSED TO USE. (LAUGHTER)  I UNDERSTAND. NOW NO SURPRISE, MIX IT UP  DAY IS THE BRAINCHILD OF THE  FAR LEFT SOUTHERN POVERTY  LAW CENTERS TEACHING TOLERANCE PROGRAM. WHICH PUTS ITS HOMOSEXUAL  AGENDA RIGHT THERE IN THE  LOGO. I MEANS THAT'S A FREAKY  FOUR-WAY REACH AROUND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
