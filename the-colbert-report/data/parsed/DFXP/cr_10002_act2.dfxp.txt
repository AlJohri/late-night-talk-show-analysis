Stephen: HOLA. YOU JUST CAUGHT ME CELEBRATING HISPANIC CULTURE. I'M WEARING MEXICO'S OFFICIAL HAT AND THE TRADITIONAL MEXICAN AREA RUG WITH THE HOLE CUT IN IT. (LAUGHTER) AND I'M HEATING UP UN MUY AUTHENTICO BURRITO FROM SIETE ONCE. (LAUGHTER) HEY! HEY, THAT'S REALLY (BLEEP)ING HOT! (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT? WOW! (LAUGHS) THAT IS MUCH HOTTER THAN WE REHEARSED! THAT WOULD GO GREAT WITH UN GULPO MASS GRANDE. IT'S SUCH A RICH CULTURE. HIMMY, PLAY ME SOME MEXICAN MUSIC TO GET ME OVER TO THE DESK. ♪ COME ON SHAKE YOUR BODY ♪ BABY DO THAT CONGA ♪ I KNOW YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOURSELF ANY LONGER ♪ ♪  ♪
Stephen: YOU SEE, FOLKS, I AM CELEBRATING MY LATINO HERMANOS AND HISMANOS EVEN MORE THAN USUAL BECAUSE IT IS HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH WHICH RUNS FROM SEPTEMBER 15 TO ACT 15. YES, EVEN THEIR HERITAGE MONTH JUMPED THE BORDER. (LAUGHTER) WHEN WILL WE FINALLY BUILD THE FENCE? FOLKS, NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1968 WHEN IT WAS FIRST APPROVED BY FAMOUS LATINO-AMERICAN PRESIDENT LEENDON YONSON. (LAUGHTER) AND MY FRIENDS OVER AT FOX NEWS HAVE REALLY TAKEN THEIR HISPANIC HERITAGE FESTIVITIES UP A NOTCH THIS YEAR BY HAVING SOME. JIM? LET'S START THE CELEBRATION.
MEXICO IS NOT A FRIEND TO THE U.S.A.
LOS ANGELES COUNTY SET TO PAY $650 MILLION IN WELFARE BENEFITS THIS YEAR TO ILLEGALS WHO HAVE CHILDREN.
ILLEGAL ALIENS ARE DESTROYING THAT STATE.
HEINOUS CRIMES COMMITTED BY ILLEGAL ALIENS OCCUR REGULARLY.
INSTEAD OF CALLING THEM ILLEGALS, LET'S CALL THEM OCCUPIERS OR TRESPASSERS OR INVADERS OR SQUATTERS. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Stephen: OH, I'M SORRY! THAT WAS WRONG FOOTAGE. I MEAN, SOME OF THAT IS FROM WAY BACK IN SEPTEMBER OF -- THIS SEPTEMBER. (LAUGHTER) JIMMY, SHOW THEM THE NEW LATINO HERITAGE HONORING FOX NEWS.
GOYA FOODS IS A THIRD-GENERATION FAMILY-RUN BILLION-DOLLAR OPERATION. A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST KNOW THEM FOR THEIR RICE AND BEANS. YOU'LL FIND GOYA PRODUCTS JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE.
THANK YOU FOR THAT WONDERFUL REPORT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL FOODS AISLE. (LAUGHTER) I LOOK FORWARD TO FOX NEWS' REPORT ON ITALIAN HERITAGE FEATURING CHEF BOYARDEE. (LAUGHTER) ALL THIS MONTH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FOX NEWS HAS BEEN LOADED WITH MOVING TRIBUTES TO LATINO CULTURE.
AN ESTIMATED 100,000 CHILDREN OF 60,000 UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS RECEIVED AID IN L.A. COUNTY.
Stephen: DID YOU CATCH THAT? CHRIS WALLACE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE OFFSPRING OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND HIS GRAPHIC READS "CHILDREN OF THE CORN." (AUDIENCE REACTS) FOLKS, THAT'S JUST HISPANIC HERITAGE. EITHER BECAUSE THEY PICK CORN OR THEY EAT A LOT OF CORN OR BECAUSE THAT MOVIE ABOUT A CULT OF CHILDREN WHO MURDER EVERY ADULT IN TOWN. IT'S STILL A COMPLIMENT BECAUSE HISPANIC KIDS MURDER EVERYONE FOR HALF THE PRICE. (LAUGHTER) FOX NEWS, BRAVO! THAT IS AN HISPANIC WORD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS BUT YOU GET ONE. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR NEXT ROUND OF FLATTERING CHARACTERIZATIONS OF HISPANIC KIDS LIKE NACHO CHIPS OFF THE OLE BLOCK AND MEXICAN HUMPING BEANS. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
