(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: OOH! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
STEPHEN: WELCOME! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY! WHETHER YOU KNOW IT OR NOT, I HAVE BIG NEWS FOR YOU NOW. YOU HAVE JOINED US ON AN HISTORIC NIGHT. THIS WEEK MARKS THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RESIGNATION OF RICHARD MILHOUS JOWLSWORTH NIXON. (LAUGHTER) WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A BALLOON DROP IN HIS HONOR, BUT, INSTEAD, WE JUST DECIDED TO SECRETLY DROP THEM OVER CAMBODIA. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS A SOLEMN DAY FOR ME BECAUSE NIXON IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE NON-REAGAN PRESIDENT, NON-CHENEY VICE PRESIDENT, AND NON-OATS QUAKER. (LAUGHTER) TO THIS DAY, NIXON'S 1972 CAMPAIGN POSTER HANGS IN MY OFFICE. IT REMINDS ME OF A SIMPLER TIME IN AMERICA, WHEN MY PARENTS SEEMED VERY TALL AND YOU'D GET A GOLD STAR JUST FOR USING THE TOILET. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, BEFORE WE DELVE INTO THE SO-CALLED SCANDAL THAT COST US THIS GREAT LEADER, LET'S GET TO KNOW THE MAN. RICHARD NIXON WAS BORN IN 1913 IN YORBA LINDA, CALIFORNIA. EVEN AT AN EARLY AGE, HE REFUSED TO WEAR MAKEUP, WHICH IS WHY EVEN HIS MOTHER PREFERRED KENNEDY'S BABY PICTURES. (LAUGHTER) AFTER SERVING IN THE NAVY, NIXON WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS AND ROSE TO POLITICAL PROMINENCE AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE IN THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE, WHERE HE ACCUSED STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ALGER HISS OF BEING A SOVIET SPY. IT WAS A DARK TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY, WHEN IT WAS CONSIDERED WRONG FOR GOVERNMENT WORKERS TO SPY ON AMERICANS. (LAUGHTER) IN 1952, WHILE CAMPAIGNING AS DWIGHT EISENHOWER'S RUNNING MATE, NIXON WAS GULFED IN SCANDAL WHEN THE MEDIA REPORTED HE RECEIVED IMPROPER GIFTS FROM WEALTHY DONORS. SO NIXON TOOK TO THE AIR WAVES AND SAVED HIS REPUTATION WITH WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE CHECKERS SPEECH ."
WE DID GET SOMETHING, A GIFT AFTER THE ELECTION. YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS? IT WAS A LITTLE COCKER SPANIEL DOG, AND OUR LITTLE GIRL, TRICIA, THE 6-YEAR-OLD, NAMED IT CHECKERS. AND YOU KNOW, THE KIDS, LIKE ALL KIDS, LOVE THE DOG, AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS RIGHT NOW THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT, WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: THIS SPEECH WAS THE MOST SKILLFUL POLITICAL DEFLECTION SINCE STALIN'S INFAMOUS "YES, I HAVE WORK CAMPS, BUT THEY'RE FILLED WITH KITTENS." (LAUGHTER) A TENDER MESSAGE. NIXON LOST THE 1960 ELECTION TO JOHN F. KENNEDY. IN PART DUE TO A POOR PERFORMANCE IN THE FIRST TELEVISED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. KENNEDY CHOSE TO WEAR MAKEUP, WHILE NIXON CHOSE TO BE IN BLACK AND WHITE. (LAUGHTER) A ROOKIE MISTAKE. BUT EIGHT YEARS LATER, NIXON PULLED OFF THE GREATEST POLITICAL COMEBACK IN HISTORY, WHEN HE SWEPT INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. AS PRESIDENT, HIS ACHIEVEMENTS WERE MANY. HE FOUNDED THE E.P.A., ENDED SCHOOL SEGREGATION, LOWERED THE VOTING AGE TO 18 AND ENDORSED THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT. BUT HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT WAS RESTORING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH CHINA. FOR WHICH WE OWE NIXON A LASTING DEBT -- AND CHINA $1.3 TRILLION. (LAUGHTER) BUT THIS GOOD MAN WAS FORCED -- (APPLAUSE) YES. YES. MAO MONEY, MAO PROBLEMS BUT THIS GOOD MAN WAS FORCED FROM OFFICE BY HIS BLOODTHIRSTY ENEMIES WHO, ACCORDING TO A PARTIAL LIST PREPARED BY NIXON, WERE EVERYONE. (LAUGHTER) THE SCANDAL WAS CALLED WATERGATE,  A SCANDAL SO EXPLOSIVE SOME CALL IT "WATERGATE-GATE." (LAUGHTER) NOT MANY. JUST ME, SO FAR. BUT AFTER TONIGHT'S SHOW... (LAUGHTER) JOIN ME NOW FOR TONIGHT'S RETROSPECTACULAR -- A, THE COLBERT SPECIAL REPORT -- SCANDAL IN THE WHITE HOUSE, A NATION BETRAYED. A FOND LOOK BACK, '74 -- (APPLAUSE) A FOND LOOK BACK, '74 -- (APPLAUSE) (CHANTING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: ON JUNE 17, 1972, FIVE MEN WERE ARRESTED FOR BREAKING INTO THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE'S HEADQUARTERS AT THE WATERGATE HOTEL. EVEN WORSE, THEY ATE A TOBELERON FROM THE MINIBAR, STICKING THE DEMOCRATS WITH A $22 SERVICE CHARGE. (LAUGHTER) AN F.B.I. INVESTIGATION CONNECTED THE WATERGATE BREAK-IN TO AN ELITE WHITE HOUSE DIRTY TRICKS GROUP KNOWN AS "THE PLUMBERS "  BECAUSE THEY WERE TASKED WITH PLUGGING LEAKS. AND BECAUSE OF THEIR AMPLE ASS CRACKS. (LAUGHTER) THE PLUMBERS WERE PART OF NIXON'S POLITICAL OPERATION, THE "COMMITTEE TO RE-ELECT THE PRESIDENT," OR "CREEP." A NAME THAT SOMEHOW ESCAPED THE SCRUTINY OF "NIXON'S UNDERCOMMITTEE FOR TERMINATING SELF-INDICTING ACRONYM CHOICES," OR "NUTSAC." (LAUGHTER) SOON, "WASHINGTON POST" REPORTERS BOB WOODWARD AND CARL BERNSTEIN, SEEN HERE AS ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE, BEGAN RECEIVING AND PUBLISHING LEAKS ABOUT THE PLOT FROM AN ANONYMOUS F.B.I. SOURCE KNOWN ONLY AS "DEEP THROAT". LATER PORTRAYED BY LINDA LOVELACE IN THE DOCUMENTARY. ON MAY 17, 1973, THE SENATE LAUNCHED THE WATERGATE HEARINGS, IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER APPOINTMENTS SECRETARY ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD REVEALED THAT NIXON HAD RECORDED EVERY CONVERSATION IN HIS OFFICE SINCE 1971, CREATING A VITAL HISTORICAL RECORD. JUST LISTEN TO THIS ACTUAL CONVERSATION.
THE PROBLEM HOWEVER, WITH PANDAS IS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO MATE. THE ONLY WAY THEY LEARN HOW IS TO WATCH OTHER PANDAS MATE. YOU SEE? (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: YES, FOR PANDAS TO MATE, THEY HAVE TO WATCH OTHER PANDAS DOING IT. ALTHOUGH, FOR MALE PANDAS, IT'S JUST AS EFFECTIVE TO WATCH TWO FEMALE PANDAS MATING. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) BUT THE MOST FAMOUS PASSAGE FROM THE RECORDINGS WASN'T ON THEM. IT WAS THE MISSING 18 1/2 MINUTES. NIXON'S SECRETARY ROSE MARY WOODS CLAIMED SHE ACCIDENTALLY PRESSED "ERASE" WITH HER FOOT ON THE TAPE RECORDER'S PEDAL WHILE REACHING FOR THE PHONE, A POSITION NOW KNOWN IN YOGA AS "DOWNWARD FACING ASS COVER ." (LAUGHTER) SO WHAT WAS ON THOSE 18 1/2 MINUTES? DID THOSE TWO PANDAS EVER DO IT? WE MAY NEVER KNOW. (LAUGHTER) SORRY, WE SEEM TO BE HAVING A SLIGHT TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY. COULD SOMEONE ADJUST THE VERTICAL HOLD? THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. (APPLAUSE) NOW, ON AUGUST 8, 1974, DAYS AFTER THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAD PASSED ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT, RICHARD NIXON BECAME THE FIRST U.S. PRESIDENT TO RESIGN SINCE WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON COWARDLY LEFT OFFICE AFTER ONE MONTH TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIS COFFIN. (LAUGHTER) WHEN WE RETURN, WE WILL BE JOINED BY FORMER NIXON SPEECHWRITER PATRICK J. BUCHANAN. PLEASE JOIN US AFTER THESE IMPORTANT MESSAGES FROM OUR SPONSORS.
