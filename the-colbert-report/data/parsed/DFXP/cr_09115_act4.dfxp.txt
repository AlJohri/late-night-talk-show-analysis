(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE WILL  HAVE MORE PAUL McCARTNEY IN JUST  A MOMENT BUT FIRST, FOLKS, IT'S HARD FOR CONSERVATIVES LIKE ME--  AND McCARTNEY-- TO LIVE IN  MICHAEL BLOOMBERG'S NEW YORK CITY NANNYOPOLIS. HE HAS INSTITUTED SMOKING BANS,  SODA BANS AND I CAN'T EVEN TELL  YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE BEEN STOPPED AND FRISKED. OH, WAIT, I CAN-- ZERO, BECAUSE  I'M NOT BLACK OR HISPANIC. AND NOW-- AND NOW-- THIS GUY HAS  LAUNCHED CITI BIKE, THE NATION'S  LARGEST BIKE-SHARING PROGRAM.
STARTING TODAY IN NEW YORKERS  CAN RENT BIKE FOR $9.95 PER DAY  OR GET A YEARLY PASS FOR $95 AND THAT GIVES YOU UNLIMITED ACCESS  TO 6,000 BICYCLES IN BROOKLYN  AND MANHATTAN.
Stephen: I DON'T SEE WHY WE  NEED THIS, FOLKS, WE ALREADY  HAVE A BIKE PROGRAM WITH UNLIMITED ACCESS FOR JUST THE  PRICE OF BOLT CUTTERS. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S WHY I AM STANDING WITH  "WALL STREET JOURNAL" EDITORIAL  BOARD MEMBER DOROTHY RABINOWITZ WHO IS SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THIS  SPOKED MENACE.
DOROTHY, WHY WOULD YOU WANT A  PROGRAM LIKE THIS IN THE FIRST  SOMEPLACE ARE WE TOO FAT?
DO NOT READ INTO THE MIND OF  THE TOTALITARIANS RUNNING THIS  GOVERNMENT OF THE CITY. LOOK, I REPRESENT THE MAJORITY  OF CITIZENS OF THIS CITY ARE  APPALLED BY WHAT HAS HAPPENED. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. DOROTHY REPRESENTS THE MAJORITY  OF CITIZENS OF NEW YORK. AS ANYONE IN CHELSEA AND THEY  WILL TELL YOU THEY ARE A FRIEND  OF DOROTHY! (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  LUCILLE BLUTH'S OLDER SISTER KNOWS --  (LAUGHTER)  -- THAT BIKES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A  PEDAL-POWERED PLAGUE.
BEFORE THIS, EVERY CITIZEN  KNEW THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT  DANGER IN THE CITY IS NOT THE YELLOW CABS, IT IS THE  BICYCLISTS WHO VEER IN AND OUT  OF THE SIDEWALK. THERE'S NOBODY WHO DOESN'T BLOW  BY EVERY TRAFFIC LIGHT AND WORSE  CUT IN AND OUT OF THE LANE BECAUSE THE BIKE LANE DOESN'T  SUIT THEM AND ON THE THE  SIDEWALKS. WE NOW LOOK AT A CITY WHOSE BEST  NEIGHBORHOODS ARE ABSOLUTELY,  YOU KNOW, BEGAMED, IS THE WORD, BY THESE BLAZING BLUE CITIBANK  BIKES ALL AROUND THE MOST PECK  WHICH YOU AREESQUE PARTS OF THE  CITY. IT IS SHOCKING.
Stephen: BEGRIMED! BEFOULED! BEDIRTY. NOW WHEN YOU'RE AMBULATING ABOUT  THE HISTORIC WEST VILLAGE A  GAUDY BLUE RACK OF BIKES WILL TAKE AWAY FROM THE SIMPLE BEAUTY  OF THE CHERRY BOXXX DISCOUNT  DILDO SHOP! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOR SHAME! FOR SHAME! AND THESE BIKES ARE NOT THE ONLY  NEWFANGLED EYESORES BESMIRCHING  OUR FAIR CITY. WHY MUST WE HAVE ALL THESE  GARISH TERMINALS FOR THE  SUBTERRANEAN WAY OR SUBWAY AS IT IS CALLED BY THE SLACK JAWED  CHUDS. (LAUGHTER)  I DON'T MIND THE LABORING MASSES  TRUNDING ABOUT UNDERGROUND, BUT  MUST WE PROVIDE THEM MEANS OF  EGRESS? LIKE A HOUSE PLANT THEY'LL SEEK  OUT THE LIGHT AND EMERGE TO THE  PUBLIC PROMENADE TO SPREAD THEIR WORKMAN'S DISEASES AMONG THEIR  SOCIAL BETTERS. I ASK YOU-- I ASK YOU-- WHO WILL  PAY FOR THE EITHER TO TREAT MY  FISHMONGERS AGO YOU? I'LL TELL YOU WHEN THIS CITY  BECAME UNFIT FOR CIVILIZED LIFE. IT WAS THE ADVENT OF THE  VERTICAL CABLED CAR FORCING  THOSE OF US WITH DELICATE  CONSTITUTIONS TO SHARE A RATTLING PENNICULAR PRESSED IN  THE UNIFORM OF AN ORGAN BRIPD  MONKEY. I PREFER FOR T SIMPLER WAYS OF  YORE BEING CONVEYED TO MY  APARTMENT BY FOUR STOUT EUNUCHS. (LAUGHTER)  FIE I SAY ON YOUR BICYCLES! WE SHALL RETURN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
