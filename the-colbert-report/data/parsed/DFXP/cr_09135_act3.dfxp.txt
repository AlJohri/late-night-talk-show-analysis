Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANKS, EVERYBODY. PLEASE, WE'VE GOT TO... FOLKS,  WELCOME BACK TO THE COLBCHELLA  '01, THE SONG OF THE CENTURY OF THE YEAR OF THE SUMMER OR  WHATEVER. I DON'T KNOW. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME FOR THE  END OF MY CAREER. BROUGHT TO YOU BY HYUNDAI. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: I NEVER THOUGHT IT  WOULD END LIKE THIS. I NEVER... I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD END LIKE  THIS. I ALWAYS IMAGINED I'D BE CRUSHED  UNDER A COLLAPSING PILE OF  EMMYS. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? THE ONLY THING THAT CAN POSSIBLY  SAVE ME NOW IS SOME GLOBAL POP  SENSATION WHO CAN PERFORM A MEGA HIT CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE  SONG OF THE SUMMER AND WHO JUST  HAPPEN TO BE IN MY AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW.
STEPHEN, I'LL SING FOR YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: OH, MY GOD. IT'S ROBIN THICKE. ROBIN, YOU'RE THE GUY WHO DANCES  AROUND WITH THOSE GIRLS WHO ARE  ALL NAKED ON THE YOUTUBE TUBE  VIDEO.
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY SING IN  THE VIDEO ALSO, STEPHEN.
Stephen: I HADN'T NOTICED  THAT PART. I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. OH, ROBIN THICKE, WOULD YOU SING  A SONG FOR ME.
OF COURSE. I'M YOUR MAN. LET'S DO IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: PERFORMING WHAT I  FOR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL  REASONS DEEM THE SONG OF THE SUMMER, ROBIN THICKE. EVERYBODY GET UP, COME ON.
