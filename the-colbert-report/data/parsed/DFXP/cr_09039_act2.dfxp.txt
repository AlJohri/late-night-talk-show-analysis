EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS IN JUST A FEW MINUTES MY  GUEST WILL BE JIMMY WALES,  FOUNDER OF WIKIPEDIA, THE GIGANTIC FREE ONLINE  ENCYCLOPEDIA THAT INVITES USERS  TO WRITE AND EDIT ALL THE  ARTICLES. IT'S THAT FEATURE THAT ALLOWED  ME TO RALLY MY VIEWERS BACK IN  2006 TO SAVE A MAJESTIC CREATURE FROM THE THREAT OF EXTINCTION. FIND THE PAGE ON ELEPHANTS AND  CREATE AN ENTRY THAT SAYS THE  NUMBER OF ELEPHANTS HAS TRIPLED IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. FOLKS, YOU RESPONDED TO VALENTLY  THAT WIKIPEDIA LOCKED THE PAGE  AND TO THIS DAY IT REMAINS SEMI PROTECTED UNTIL MARCH 2014. WHICH MEANS THANKS TO YOU,  WIKIPEDIA'S ELEPHANT PAGE HAS  MORE PROTECTION THAN ELEGANTS --  ELEPHANTS. [  APPLAUSE  ] WITH 483 MILLION IEW NEEBLG  VISITORS AND 19 BILLION PAGE  VIEWS EVERY MONTH WIKIPEDIA SAID IT'S THE NUMBER FIVE WEB SITE IN  THE WORLD. ANOTHER SOURCE CLAIMS THE NUMBER  FIVE WEB SITE IS CHINA'S  BAIDU.COM. THAT SOURCE CONTRADICTING  WIKIPEDIA, WIKIPEDIA. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO HOLD WIKIWALES FEET  TO THE FIRE IN THE BROADCAST'S  UPCOMING SEA BLOCK BUT FIRST I'VE COME TO THE DEFENSE OF A  FRIEND IN NEED. MY MENTOR, COLLEAGUE AND  COMPETITIVE COUPLES MASSAGE  PARTNER BILL O'REILLY. WE'RE GOING TO REGIONALS, BILL. STAY LOOSE. HE IS ONCE AGAIN BEING ATTACKED  BY THE LIBERAL MEDIA FOR  SPEAKING THE TRUTH. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? THIS IS BLOOD IN THE WATER. SHARK, SHARK, SHARK, SHARK,  SHARK, SHARK. FOLKS ON LAST THURSDAY'S THE  FACTOR PAPA BEAR WAS DISCUSSING  OBAMA'S HOME STATE OF HAWAII, ALOHA ZONE. HE MADE THIS ASTUTE OBSERVATION.
I HAVE TO SAY HAWAII IS ONE  OF MY FAVORITE PLACES IN THE  WORLD. A LOT OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE  THEY DON'T ENFORCE THE DRUG  LAWS. YOU KNOW WHAT IS SHOCK 35% OF  THE HAWAIIAN POPULATION IS  ASIAN. ASIAN PEOPLE ARE NOT LIBERAL BY  NATURE. THEY ARE USUALLY MORE INDUST  INDUSTRIOUS AND HARD WORKING.
Stephen: LEAVE IT TO  LIBERAL MEDIA TO TWIST THAT TO  RACISM. HE WAS NOT BEING RACIST. HE WAS PAINTING AN ENTIRE RACE  WITH ONE BRUSH. SPEAKING OF WHICH VIETNAMESE,  GREAT PAINTERS. DID MY ENTIRE GARAGE IN AN  AFTERNOON. DIDN'T USE SCAFFOLDING. THEY HUNG FROM VINES. [ LAUGHTER ] NO ONE IN THE MEDIA-ESCAPE  FROTHED HARDER THAN MSNBC HOST  AND TALKING BLOCK OF SMOKED GOU,  DA. JIM?
GUY WHO TELLS US HE WAS NOT A  RACIST PROVED HIMSELF WRONG  AGAIN. HE WAS SPOUTING OFF AGAINST  HAWAII. THE CONGRESSWOMAN ISSUED THIS  STATEMENT LEAVE IT TO BILL  O'REILLY TO THOUGHTLESSLY INSULT 1.3 MILLION PEOPLE WITH  UNSWEEPING MISSTATEMENT.
Stephen: 1.3 MILLION  ASIANS. YOU KNOW THAT NUMBER IS ACCURATE  BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD AT MATH. RELAX CONGRESSWOMAN OR AS ED  SCHULTZ CALLS YOU.
CALEN SPAIN HONBUSH-IE.
Stephen: WHO CARES. YOU SAY TOMATO, I SAY CHOP SEUY. LET'S NOT GET DISTRACT FROM THE  ICIAL IEW RACIAL INSENSITIVITY. EVERYBODY JUST CALM DOWN. PAPA BEAR SAID THEY ARE  HARD-WORKING. IT'S NOT RACISM IF IT'S A  COMPLIMENT. IF THESE ASIANS CAN'T STAND THE  HEAT THEY SHOULD STAY OUT OF THE  KITCHEN WHERE THE LAT TEEN YESES  ARE. OKAY. VERY HIGH TOLERANCE FOR HEAT. GOTTA ADMIRE THAT. THAT IS NOT STEREOTYPING. BLACK PEOPLE COME FROM AFRICA  WHERE IT'S HOT BUT IT DID NOT  GIVE THEM A TOLERANCE FOR HEAT. IT MADE THEM EXTREMELY FAT. ♪ ♪  HERE? OKAY. RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU. WELL, FOLKS, I HAVE BEEN  INFORMED BY MY NETWORK'S LAWYER  THAT EVEN WHEN COMPLIMENTING, I SHOULD NOT RACIALLY GENERALIZE. I ASSUME HE IS RIGHT. JEWS MAKE THE BEST LAWYERS. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ ♪  AND RIGHT THERE. AND DO I DATE IT, RIGHT THERE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. EVIDENTLY MY RACIAL COMMENTS  WERE ALSO INSENSITIVE WHICH HAS  A WOMAN, OF COURSE, SHE'S FAR MORE ATTUNED TO BECAUSE OF HER
