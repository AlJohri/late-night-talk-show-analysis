(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, I LOVE THE N.F.L. IT'S AMERICA'S TOP FORUM FOR DISCUSSING ISSUES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND I UNDERSTAND THE EMPLOYEES ALSO GET TOGETHER AND PLAY BALL ON THE WEEKENDS. (LAUGHTER) AND THE BIGGEST BUT NOT THE LATEST SAD NEWS OUT OF THE N.F.L. IS THE ARREST OF MINNESOTA VIKINGS RUNNING BACK ADRIAN PETERSON ON CHARGES OF CHILD ABUSE. AFTER HE "SPANKED HIS SON SO HARD WITH A SWITCH THE BOY SUFFERED INJURIES ALL OVER HIS BODY." REALLY MAKES YOU NOSTALGIC FOR THE DAYS WHEN PLAYERS WERE ACCIDENTALLY SHOOTING THEMSELVES THROUGH THEIR SWEAT PANTS. (LAUGHTER) PETERSON WAS SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY THIS WEEK AND FOX NEWS' SENIOR NERF FOOTBALL CHUCKER, SEAN HANNITY, WAS NOT PLEASED. (LAUGHTER)
I GOT HIT WITH A STRAP, BAM, BAM, BAM -- AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO SHRINK -- BY MY FATHER. I WILL TELL YOU THAT I DESERVED IT. I THINK HE WENT TOO FAR, BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS GUY GET A FELONY. I DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS GUY LOSE HIS JOB.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPANKING AND CHILD ABUSE, SPANKING AND CORPORAL PUNISHMENT. BUT WE GREW UP IN A TIME --
I GOT IT LIKE THIS -- AGH, AGH, AGH!
STEPHEN: PUMPKIN PATCH! PUMPKIN PATCH! I'M SORRY. THAT'S THE SAFE WORD SEAN AND I AGREED ON. BUT HANNITY IS RIGHT ON THIS ONE. ADRIAN PETERSON WENT TOO FAR, BUT THE MAN DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE. AFTER ALL, SEAN'S DAD WHIPPED HIM WITH A BELT, AND HE NEVER NEEDED TO GO TO A PSYCHOTHERAPIST! HE JUST HAS TO HAVE THEM ON HIS SHOW THREE TIMES A WEEK. (LAUGHTER) AND SEAN WENT ON TO EXPLAIN JUST HOW UNAFFECTED HE WAS BY HIS CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE HE CAN'T STOP MENTIONING.
SO MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED BASED ON TODAY'S STANDARDS?
MAYBE, YES.
THAT IS NUTS. I WILL TELL YOU, I WAS NOT MENTALLY BRUISED BECAUSE MY FATHER HIT ME WITH A BELT.
STEPHEN: NO, HE WAS PHYSICALLY BRUISED. MENTALLY, HE GREW UP TO BE A PSYCHOLOGICALLY HEALTHY ADULT WHO CLEAVES DESPERATELY TO STRONG AUTHORITY FIGURES, LASHES OUT AT PERCEIVED WEAKNESS AND TAKES HIS BELT OFF ON LIVE TV. (LAUGHTER) STILL, IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR HANNITY'S GREAT AMERICAN PANEL TO TURN INTO A GREAT AMERICAN INTERVENTION.
WE'RE GOING TO ARREST EVERYBODY THAT HAS EVER HIT THEIR KIDS?
BUT IT'S A CHANGING TIME.
CHANGING TIME.
DID YOUR DAD STICK LEAVES IN YOUR MOUTH LIKE ADRIAN PETERSON --
MY DAD PUNCHED ME IN THE FACE WHEN I TALKED BACK TO HIM ONCE, AND I DESERVED IT.
STEPHEN: SEE? ALL HANNITY IS SAYING IS THAT SOME CHILDREN DESERVE TO BE PUNCHED IN THE FACE. ALTHOUGH IT IS SAD TO SEE THAT, SO MANY YEARS LATER, THE SWELLING STILL HASN'T GONE DOWN. (LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS, OUR COUNTRY'S GONE SOFT. NOT LIKE IN MY DAY. WHEN I WAS A KID AND I DIDN'T EAT MY PEAS, MY MOM WOULD BASH ME OVER THE HEAD WITH A FOLDING CHAIR. (LAUGHTER) WHEN I STAYED OUT PAST DARK, I COULD EXPECT TO SEE MY DAD WAITING IN THE KITCHEN WITH A BURLAP SACK AND A RABID BADGER. (LAUGHTER) AND I WON'T SOON FORGET THE TIME PEE-POP GOT ME IN A FULL NELSON, AND THEN TAGGED IN MY GRANDMA, WHO CAME IN OFF THE TOP ROPE WITH AN ELBOW DROP THAT MADE ME THINK TWICE ABOUT NOT WEARING MY RETAINER. (LAUGHTER) AND I DESERVED IT EVERY TIME. NOT BECAUSE I MADE AN INNOCENT CHILDHOOD MISTAKE, BUT BECAUSE I AM A BAD, BAD PERSON. I AM A FAILURE! DISAPPOINTING EVERYONE I LOVE, EVEN YOU, TOOTS. (AUDIENCE REACTS) EVEN YOU! I'M SO SORRY YOU HATE ME BECAUSE I CAN'T BE LOVED! (CRYING) OH, GOD  I'M EMBARRASSING MYSELF ON NATIONAL TELEVISION. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY I'LL LEARN. THIS WILL TEACH YOU TO LOSE CONTROL ON TELEVISION! NEVER LET THEM SEE WHO YOU REALLY ARE! (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, SEAN. I'LL SEE YOU AT THE GROUP ON WEDNESDAY! (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
