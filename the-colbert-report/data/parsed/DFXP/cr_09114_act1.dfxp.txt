STEPHEN    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH,  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. YOU KNOW I NEED IT. YOU KNOW I NEED IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANKS, PLEASE, FOLKS. PLEASE, FOLKS, YOU KNOW,  THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  CHANTING MY NAME. JESUS HIMSELF SAID MAN  CANNOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE  BUT BY EVERY WORD, JUST  CHANTED BY YOUR AUDIENCE. FOLKS, LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO  THE STORY EVERYONE'S TALKING  ABOUT. THE NSA KNOWS WHAT  EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. (LAUGHTER)  AND ACCORDING TO STUNNING  NEW ARTICLES FIRST PUBLISHED  BY FRIEND OF THE SHOW AND PROFESSIONAL BLABBERMOUTH  GLEN GREENWALD IN THE U.K.'S  THE GUARDIAN THE NEWSPAPER, THE NSA IS ALSO ENGAGING IN  CYBERSNOOPING.
NSA THE NATIONAL SECURITY  AGENCY HAS ASSETS TO THE  CENTRAL SERVERS TO SOME OF THE TOP U.S. TECHNOLOGY  FIRMS THROUGH A PROGRAM  CALLED PRISM, THOSE FIRMS  BEING MICROSOFT, GOOGLE, YAHOO!, FACEBOOK, APPLE, AOL,  SKYPE, YOUTUBE AND PAL TALK.
Stephen: YOU HEARD RIGHT. THEY'RE MONITORING PAL TALK. WELL, FOLKS, FOLKS, YOU KNOW  WHAT THAT MEANS. WE ARE THIS CLOSE TO  LEARNING WHAT PAL TALK IS. (LAUGHTER)  NOW THIS BETRAYAL OF OUR  NATIONAL SECURITY COMES  COURT SEE OF FORMER CIA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND  NERD TRYING TO LOOK LIKE A  COOL GUY TRYING TO LOOK LIKE A NERD EDWARD SNOWDEN. SNOWDEN LEAKED A TOP SECRET  POWER POINT PRESENTATION  THAT DETAILED HOW THE  GOVERNMENT GATHERS MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION ON  EVERYTHING BUT GRAPHIC  DESIGN. (LAUGHTER)  NOW FOLKS, THIS SECRET  PROGRAM'S NAME PRISM IS AN  ACRONYM FOR PLANNING TOOL FOR RESOURCE INTEGRATION  SYNCHRONIZATION AND  MANAGEMENT. INCIDENTALLY, FOR REVEALING  PRISM, SNOWDEN MAY SOON BE  IN PRISON, FOR, PROBABLY, REGRETTING, IDENTIFYING,  SELF, ON, NATIONAL, TV. NOW DESPITE BEING IMPLICATED  IN THE POWER POINT GOOGLE  DENIES THEIR INVOLVEMENT SAYING IN A STATEMENT THAT  GOOGLE DOES NOT HAVE A BACK  DOOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ACCESS PRIVATE USER DATA. MAYBE SO. BUT WHEN I GOOGLED THE WORDS  BACK DOOR AND PRIVATE ACCESS,  I SURE FOUND EVIDENCE OF DISTURBING PROBING. AND THERE IS ONLY ONE THING,  FOLKS, THAT I DO NOT LIKE  ABOUT THIS WHOLE NSA  SURVEILLANCE. IT'S HAPPENING ON PRESIDENT  OBAMA'S WATCH. AND IT'S EARNING HIM HIGH  PRAISE FROM CONSERVATIVES.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IS AS  IF GEORGE BUSH IS BACK IN  OFFICE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE  STEPS HE HAS TAKEN TO FIGHT  TERROR TO KEEP HIM SAFE IT IS MUCH ABOUT WHAT GEORGE  BUSH STARTED AND CONTINUED. WIRETAPS, INDEFINITE  DETENTION, KEEPING  GUANTANAMO OPEN, IT'S DRONE  STRIKES. I REFER TO IT AS PRESIDENT  BUSH'S FOURTH TERM.
Stephen: SHUT UP, BALDY! GEORGE W. BUSH IS MY HERO. HE IS MY ROLE MODEL. HE IS MY DESIGNATED DRIVER. THIS GUY, THIS GUY IS JUST  IMITATING, IT WILL MAKE ME  LIKE HIM. I DON'T CARE HOW MANY BALL  GAME US TAKE PLE TO OR HOW  MANY CITIZENS YOU BLOW UP, YOU'RE NOT MY REAL  PRESIDENT. YOU'RE JUST SOME GUY NAMED  BARRY! (LAUGHTER)  I HATE YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND FOLKS, WHILE THERE'S A  LOT OF TALK ABOUT E-MAILS  AND PHONE CALLS, I AM WAY MORE EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW  SURVEILLANCE DEVICES THAT  THEY ARE COOKING UP.
IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO  KNOW WHEN I'M USING MY  MICROWAVE OVEN.
GENERAL PETRAEUS WHEN HE  RAN THE CIA GAVE A SPEECH  THAT HE THOUGHT WAS SECRET AND SOMEBODY COPIED IT AND  MADE IT PUBLIC THAT SAID NEW  MIKE WAVES AND DISHWASHERS THAT HAVE COMPUTER CHIPS IN  THERE THAT THEY CAN ACCESS  SO THEY KNOW WHEN YOUS ARE USING YOUR MICROWAVE AND  DISHWASHER.
Stephen: I'M NOT  SURPRISED THEY PUT  SURVEILLANCE CHIPS IN  MICROWAVES. WE KNOW THEY ALREADY HAVE  METAL DETECTORS. AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT  PEOPLE ARE NUKING. I MEAN ISN'T A MICROWAVE  BORE ITO? -- BURRITO, A, THEY ARE  FOREIGN AND I KNOW FOR A  FACT THEY HAVE EXPLOSIVE  POTENTIAL. BUT LOOK, FOLKS, LOOK--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, I CAN ADMIT THAT THIS  GUARDIAN STORY DOES RAISE A LOT OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. LIBERALS ASK IF WE ARE  SACRIFICING TOO MUCH FREEDOM  FOR SECURITY. CONSERVATIVES ASK IF WE ARE  SHOWING OUR HAND TO THE  TERRORISTS BUT THE GUARDIAN ASKS THE MOST IMPORTANT  QUESTION OF ALL, COULD THE  GUARDIAN WIN A PULITZER FOR  EDWARD SNOWDEN'S NSA  REVELATIONS? WHICH LEADS ME TO ASK, COULD  I WIN AN EMMY FOR MY REPORT  ON THE GUARDIAN WONDERING IF THEY COULD WIN A PULITZER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND --
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
I HOPE YOU'RE VOTERS. AND WILL MY MORNING RERUN BE  ELIGIBLE FOR A KID'S CHOICE  AWARD. SHOULD WE EVEN BE DISCUSSING  THIS? WELL, THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO  THINK SO.
NOW I WELCOME THIS  DEBATE. AND I THINK IT'S HEALTHY FOR  OUR DEMOCRACY.
Stephen: YES, I WELCOME  IT TOO, VERY HEALTHY. IT'S A DEBATE WELL WORTH  HAVING. THE MOMENT WE FOUND OUT  ABOUT IT IN 2006. SO ALSO LET'S HAVE A DEBATE  ABOUT WHY THE GILMORE GIRLS  WERE CANCELLED. BECAUSE FOLKS, THE FACT IS  WE HAD THIS DEBATE. AND WE SURRENDERED OUR  RIGHTS BACK WHEN WE WERE  PROPERLY IN THE GRIP OF  FEAR. AND I KNOW IT WON'T BE EASY. WE'VE GOT TO DIG DOWN DEEP  AND SOMEHOW FIND THE COURAGE  TO STAY SCARED [BLEEP]. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE IF IT REALLY BOTHERS  YOU, FOLKS, THERE ARE PLENTY  OF WAYS TO AVOID THIS GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE. JUST DON'T TEXT, TWEET, MAKE  PHONE CALLS, OR USE PAL TALK  EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THAT'S A  SACRIFICE. INSTEAD, INSTEAD IF YOU  ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY NEED  TO GET A MESSAGE TO A FRIEND, JUST DO WHAT OUR GRANDPARENTS  DID, AND USE A CARRIER  CHICKEN. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. SIMPLE PROCESS, OKAY. SIMPLE PROCESS, ALL RIGHT. JUST SEND A MESSAGE TO MY  BUDDY HERE, MY BUDDY LOU  DAWG. WHAT'S UP, WHAT UP, LOU  DAWG! THINGS ARE CHILL HERE. CAN I POP BY LATER FOR SOME  FRIED CARRIER CHICKEN? ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ROLL  THAT UP THERE. RIGHT THERE. THERE YOU GO. AND UH-HUH THERE YOU GO. AND GO FIND LOU DAWG. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  YOU SEE THERE ARE ALWAYS  WAYS TO OPT OUT OF BIG  BROTHER. HERE TO TELL ME THAT THERE  IS NO WAY TO OPT OUT OF BIG  BROTHER IS THE PRESIDENT & CEO OF THE NATIONAL  CONSTITUTION CENTER LEGAL  AFFAIRS EDITOR OF THE NEW  REPUBLIC AND LAW PROFESSOR AT GEORGE WASHINGTON  UNIVERSITY, JEFFREY ROSEN,  JEFFREY, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT THIS NEW ARTICLE IN  THE NEW REPUBLIC, AVAILABLE  ON-LINE ASKING PRESIDENT OBAMA TO REVEAL THE LETTER  THAT SAYS WHY HE HAS THE  RIGHT TO DO THIS GATHERING  TO THE NSA. WHAT DO YOU HAVE WITH  THIS-- WHAT'S YOUR BEEF HERE,  SIR. WHAT ARE YOU HIDING THAT YOU  DON'T WANT OBAMA TO FIND OUT  ABOUT? WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLED  FOR A NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT  THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. AND I WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN  THAT DEBATE BY SAYING AS  JUSTIN-- JUSTICE ANTONIN  SCALIA DID JUST THIS MONDAY, A HERO OF YOURS, A  CONSERVATIVE. NOW HE'S MY HERO TOO BECAUSE  HE SAID THE FRAMERS OF THE  FOURTH AMENDMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN APPALLED BY THE IDEA  THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD  SEIZE INFORMATION WITHOUT  PARTICULARLY SPECIFYING THE PLACE TO BE SEARCHED OR THE  PERSON OR THINGS.
Stephen: BUT THERE IS NO  EXPECTATION THAT YOUR PHONE  RECORDS ARE YOUR RECORDS. IT WAS SETTLED IN 1979 IN A  SUPREME COURT CASE THAT THE  PHONE COMPANY OWNS THOSE  RECORDS. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT  SUBPOENAING YOUR RECORDS. THEY'RE THE PHONE COMPANY'S  RECORDS. THAT ALLOWS THE PHONE  COMPANY TO SHARE THEM WITH  PRIVATE INDUSTRY BUT WE WERE  NOT AWARE THAT VERIZON, FOR EXAMPLE S SHARING THE MEHTADATA,  THE TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND  DURATION OF MY CALLS WITH THE GOVERNMENT ON AN ONGOING  DAILY BASIS.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE  PROBLEM WITH THAT. WHAT'S WRONG WITH GETTING  TOGETHER, AS THEY SAY, THE  HEY STAKE, OKAY, THE  HAYSTACK OF INFORMATION SO THEY CAN THEN FIND THE  NEEDLE IN IT. ARE YOU ANTI-HAYSTACK OR PRO  NEED SNELL.
I AM PRO FOURTH AMENDMENT  AND THE FOURTH AMENDMENT  SAYS YOU CANNOT HAVE GENERAL SEARCHES OF INFORMATION ON  AN ONGOING DAILY BASIS  WITHOUT PARTICULAR  INFORMATION THAT IS CLINGING TO A PARTICULAR CLIMATE.
WE ARE BEING GENERALLY  ATTACKED. WE ARE GENERALLY UNDER  THREAT. YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAY, THERE  WAS THE ATTACK ON 9/11 THERE  IS THE ATTACK AT FT. HOOD, THE ATTACK IN BOSTON. THOSE ARE SPREAD OUT ALL  ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY E IT'S  ONLY GOING TO BE IN DADE  COUNTY.
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF  THIS GENERAL DATA MINING  WORKS. THE SENATORS WHO WERE BRAEFED  ON THE PROGRAM, SENATORS  WIDEN AND UDAL SAID AMERICAN WAS BE APPALLED IF THEY KNEW  THE PATRIOT ACT WAS BEING  USED IN THIS WAY AND WERE NOT CONVINCED IT WAS  STOPPING SERIOUS THREATS.
DO YOU THINK WE ARE  VENNERING FREEDOMS HERE IN  THE FACE OF TERRORIST  THREAT.
I THINK NOT ONLY ARE WE  DOING THAT BUT DOING SO  UNNECESSARILY BECAUSE YOU COULD DESIGN THESE PROGRAMS  IN A WAY THAT PROTECTED PRIV  SEE AND SECURITY AT THE SAME  TIME.
Stephen: IT MIGHT BE A  CUNNING PLAN. BECAUSE HERE AWAY WHY. THEY HATE US FOR OUR  FREEDOM. SO LESS FREEDOM WE HAVE, THE  LESS LIKELY THEY ARE TO  ATTACK US. (APPLAUSE)  ALL RIGHT FROM THE NATIONAL  CONSTITUTION CENTER AND THE  NEW REPUBLIC JEFFREY ROSEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
