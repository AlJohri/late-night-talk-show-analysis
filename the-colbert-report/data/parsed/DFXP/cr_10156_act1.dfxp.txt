(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
STEPHEN: THANK YOU SO MUCH! WELCOME, EVERYBODY! HOLD ON ONE SECOND. I FORGOT TO DO SOMETHING. (CHEERING)
STEPHEN: THANKS, EVERYBODY! I APOLOGIZE! THIS IS MY PHONE. I SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS EARLIER. I'M JUST CHECKING ON THE ORDER STATUS OF MY IPHONE 6. IT COMES OUT TOMORROW, BUT FOR SOME REASON -- OH! IT'S HERE NOW! SO BEAUTIFUL! YOU ARE WORSE THAN USELESS. I HATE YOU! YOU'RE PERFECT AND I WILL NEVER STOP LOVING YOU... (LAUGHTER) OOH, THIS ONE CAME PRE-LOADED WITH NUDE PHOTOS OF BONO! (LAUGHTER) OH, I'M GLAD I GOT THE 6 PLUS. (LAUGHTER) AND I REALLY NEEDED THIS NEW GADGET BECAUSE IT'S NO SECRET THAT WE ARE SLAVES TO OUR ELECTRONIC DEVICES. AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT SIRI TOLD ME TO SAY. (LAUGHTER) EVERY DAY, WE BURY OUR HEADS IN OUR PHONES, DESPERATE TO DOWNLOAD EVERY TERABYTE OF INFORMATION IN THE WORLD, AND THE ONLY PRICE WE PAY IS MISSING THE WORLD AROUND US. WOW, THAT'S PRETTY DEEP -- I SHOULD TWEET THAT. BUT LUCKILY, THERE'S A NEW APP DESIGNED TO HELP YOU SCREEN YOUR SCREEN TIME.
NEED A REALITY CHECK ON HOW MANY TIMES A DAY YOU CHECK YOUR PHONE? THERE'S A NEW APP FOR THAT CALLED CHECKY. IT WILL SHOW YOU HOW MANY TIMES YOU CHECK THE PHONE!
STEPHEN: YES, CHECKY. IT BEATS THE PREVIOUS WAY TO TELL IF YOU WERE CHECKING YOUR PHONE TOO MUCH -- WALKING INTO A MALL FOUNTAIN. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: CAUGHT ME OFF-GUARD THERE. CHECKY IS A WORTHY SUCCESSOR TO MY PREVIOUS FAVORITE APP FOR LIMITING PHONE USAGE, "BATTERY." (LAUGHTER) I INSTALLED CHECKY TODAY ON THE NEW PHONE, AND I GOTTA ADMIT, I HAVE BEEN CHECKING MY PHONE A LOT TODAY, TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE SEES ME CHECKING MY NEW PHONE A LOT TODAY. IN FACT -- I'M ALREADY UP TO 65 CHECKS. ACTUALLY, I BETTER CHECK CHECKITY CHECK THAT. WHOA! 66! HOLD ON. 67! WAIT A SECOND. 68! I'M ON A STREAK! BUT WAIT, CHECKY GETS EVEN MORE-ER-ER.
SO THE BEST PART, YOU CAN ACTUALLY COMPARE YOUR PHONE CHECKING AVERAGE WITH OTHER FRIENDS WHO ALSO USE THE APP.
STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT. RIGHT NOW, EVERY TIME I CHECK MY PHONE -- 69! NEW HIGH SCORE! (CHEERING) -- MY FRIENDS GET TO SEE IF I'VE CHECKED MY PHONE MORE TIMES THAN THEY'VE CHECKED THEIRS. AND LET ME TELL YOU -- 70! I'M KILLING IT IN MY FANTASY CHECKY LEAGUE. (LAUGHTER) THE LEAGUE, SO FAR, IS JUST ME AND ALL MY CLOSEST FRIENDS. THERE'S... UH... LET'S SEE. THERE'S BROWN-HAIRED GUY NO, THAT'S ME. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, I'M SURE I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS. JUST LOOK HOW COOL MY PHONE IS. (LAUGHTER) NATION, WITH TERROR GROUPS, 71, RUNNING ROUGHSHOD ALL OVER THE MIDDLE EAST, AMERICA FACES AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT UNLIKE ANY THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER KNOWN, AND ITS NAME IS BARACK OBAMA. 'CUZ WHEN IT COMES TO IGNITING A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS BASED ON CENTURIES OLD ANIMOSITY, THIS GUY'S HEART JUST ISN'T IN IT. LISTEN TO HIS NON-COMMITTAL COMMITMENT OF AMERICAN FORCES.
AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, THESE AMERICAN FORCES WILL NOT HAVE A COMBAT MISSION. WE WILL NOT GET DRAGGED INTO ANOTHER GROUND WAR IN IRAQ.
STEPHEN: WELL, NOT WITH THAT ATTITUDE WE WON'T! (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THERE'S ONE THING THIS ADMINISTRATION SAYS THEY WON'T DO.
THE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES TO INSIST THERE WILL BE NO BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
THE PRESIDENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THOSE BOOTS WILL NOT BE AMERICAN BOOTS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND.
THE NOTION THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE PUTTING BOOTS ON THE GROUND, I THINK, WOULD BE A PROFOUND MISTAKE.
STEPHEN: OF COURSE THERE WON'T BE AMERICAN BOOTS ON THE GROUND. OUR SHOES ARE ALL MADE IN CHINA. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. SO STOP WORRYING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU CLAIM "NO" BOOTS ON THE GROUND. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE 1,600 TROOPS WE ALREADY HAVE THERE? DO THEY NOT HAVE BOOTS? ARE THEY BAREFOOT, SIR? THEY COULD STUB A TOE! AND THE V.A. IS ALREADY OVERWHELMED! I'M JUST CONFUSED BY THIS MIXED MESSAGE. WHAT THE HELL DOES ANY OF THIS MEAN?
HERE'S WHY THE PRESIDENT IS SO SURE THERE WILL BE NO BOOTS ON THE GROUND. BECAUSE HE JUST CHANGED THE NAME TO "FORWARD DEPLOYMENT."
WE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. WHY CAN'T YOU CALL BOOTS ON THE GROUND BOOTS ON THE GROUND?
WHO ARE THESE BOOTS ON THE GROUND?
WHO ARE THE BOOTS? WHOSE BOOTS ARE THEY? WHERE ARE THESE BOOTS COMING FROM? SOMEBODY'S IMAGINATION OR ARE THEY REAL?
I WOULD ASSUME THEY'RE BOOTS ON THE GROUND UNLESS THEY'RE IN THAT MICHAEL J. FOX, UH, HOVERCRAFT. THAT SKATEBOARD.
STEPHEN: WELL, OBAMA? ARE THE BOOTS NOT ON THE GROUND BECAUSE THEY'RE ON THAT MICHAEL J. FOX HOVERBOARD? OR ARE THEY NOT ON THE GROUND BECAUSE OUR TROOPS HAVE TURNED INTO TEEN WOLVES AND ARE DUNKING A BASKETBALL RIGHT NOW? WHICH MICHAEL J. FOX MOVIE IS IT? AND PLEASE DON'T SAY "CASUALTIES OF WAR." FORTUNATELY, FOX NEWS GUEST AND H.P. LOVECRAFT TRIBUTE NAME PETER HEGSETH WAS ABLE TO RESOLVE ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FOOTWEAR, AS WELL AS THE FOOT-WHEN, AND THE FOOT-WHY. JIM?
SO THIS RIGHT HERE, GRETCHEN, IS A CONVENTIONAL STANDARD ARMY ISSUE COMBAT BOOT. THIS IS WHAT A TRIGGER PULLER WOULD WEAR. THIS IS WHAT I WORE IN IRAQ. THIS IS THE MASSIVE ARMED FORCES. NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT BRINGING THEM OR HAVING THEM ON THE GROUND AT THIS POINT. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A BOOT LIKE THIS. THIS IS A BOOT OF A SPECIAL OPERATOR OR ONE THAT THEY MIGHT WEAR. THESE -- THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I GUESS THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING IS THE BOOTS THAT YOU BROUGHT TO THE SHOW TODAY MAY LOOK DIFFERENT, BUT A BOOT IS A BOOT.
THEY'RE BOTH BOOTS. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: YES! THEY'RE BOTH BOOTS! FOLKS, THIS RIGHT HERE, THAT -- THAT IS THE TYPE OF IN-DEPTH REPORTING YOU CAN ONLY GET FROM FOX NEWS OR ZAPPOS! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THE POINT IS, DIFFERENT TROOPS WEAR DIFFERENT BOOTS. WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION -- WHICH FOOTWEAR ARE WE WILLING TO PUT ON THE GROUND? I MEAN, OBAMA SAID HE WOULDN'T PUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND. BUT APPARENTLY, THAT WAS A TOTAL CROC, BECAUSE NOW HE'S FLIP-FLOPPING, WHICH IS MAKING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY "UGG"! AND (BLEEP) ME. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I'VE ALWAYS SAID OBAMA IS A LOAFER. BUT WITH HIS CONSTANT GOLFING, NOW HE JUST LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF CLOWN! (LAUGHTER) 'CUZ HE KNOWS BOOTS ON THE GROUND ARE A SLIPPER-Y SLOPE, AND THE LAST THING HE NEEDS IS ANOTHER WEDGE ISSUE. HE NEEDS TO STOP CONVERSE-ING WITH OUR ALLIES AND JUST DO IT! COWBOY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OTHERWISE, THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE TAKING IT IN THE BOOTY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
