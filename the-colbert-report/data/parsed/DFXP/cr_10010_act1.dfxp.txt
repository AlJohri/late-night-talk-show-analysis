NIGHT A NEW WAY TO EAT ONTHE GO. TRACHEOTOMIES AREN'T JUST FOR BREATHING ANYMORE. THEN IT'S CHRISTMAS GIFT SEASON. I KNOW WHO'S BEEN NAUGHTY, WHO'S BEEN NICE, AND THANKS TO THE N.S.A., EVERYTHING ELSE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND MY GUEST, A. SCOTT BERG, THE PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING AUTHOR WITH A NEW BIOGRAPHY ON WOODROW WILSON. TWO MILLION FOR LINCOLN, ONE FOR WILSON. RESEARCH VERSION DEVELOPED A BREATHALYZER FOR MARIJUANA. AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN TURNED INTO A BONG. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT.    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) Y THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THIS AUDIENCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT YOU PEOPLE, BUT RIGHT NOW I AM FIGHTING A VERY STRONG URGE TO COME OUT THERE AND GIVE YOU BIG HUGS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU AT HOME. THESE PEOPLE SMELL FANTASTIC. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, NATION AS A TRADITIONALIST WHO SEES THE WORLD WITH COMMONSENSE CLARITY, THESE DAYS A LOT OF OUR VALUE JUDGMENTS I BELIEVE ARE JUST PLAIN WRONG. FOR INSTANCE, IF WE REALLY WANT TO HELP SICK KIDS, WHY DO WE MAKE MEDICINE BOTTLES WITH CHILDPROOF CAPS? ( LAUGHTER ) AM I THE ONLY ONE THINKING THESE THINGS? KEEP GOING. YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, APPARENTLY I AM NOT, BECAUSE THE VIEWERS ARE ALWAYS RIDING ME FOR ANSWERS. FOR INSTANCE, ARE THESE LETTERS? LET'S FIND OUT. ALL RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE WE GO. YUP. RIGHT THERE. YUP, THIS IS ONE. IT SAYS, "STEPHEN, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO DO ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR INBOX SEGMENTS? THANKS FOR ASKING. RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).   ( CHEERS ) FOLKS, TONIGHT'S FEATURE LETTER COMES TO US FROM STEPHEN C.-- NO, SORRY, THAT'S WHO IT'S ADDRESSED TO. ANYWAY, THE QUESTION S, DEAR STEPHEN, WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT, A LION OR A TIGER? PLEASE SAY LION. IT'S IMPORTANT." TIMOTHY DANIELS, Ph.D., AGE 46. GREAT QUESTION, TIMMY. THIS IS A CLASSIC RIVALRY, ONE OF THE FEW I'VE NEVER WEIGHED IN ON. LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS. LIONS HUNT IN PACTION. THEY'RE USED TO GANG FIGHTS. WHILE TIGERS ARE SOLITARY, HUNTING ALONE. I ALWAYS PUT MY MONEY ON THE DRIFTER, WHETHER IT'S BIG CATS OR BONG FIGHTS. THAT'S A CLEAR ADVANTAGE TO THE TIGER. WHEN IT COMES TO SIZE YOU MIGHT THINK THE LION WOULD WIN BECAUSE THEY'RE HUGE, THE SECOND LARGEST MEMBER OF THE CAT FAMILY. YOU KNOW WHO'S FIRST? ( BLEEP ) TIGERS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) LIONS, LIONS, FOLKS, LIONS CAN WEIGH UP TO 550 POUNDS WHILE TIGERS HAVE WEIGH UP TO 800. BUT THEY DON'T LOOK IT BECAUSE THE VERTICAL STRIPES ARE SLIMMING. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, BOTH LIONS AND TIGERS HAVE TAILS, SO THAT'S A WASH. BUT THE TIGER'S LIFE SPAN IS 10 TO 15 YEARS, WHILE THE LION'S IS A MERE 10 TO 14 YEARS. ( LAUGHTER ) SO IF IT COMES DOWN TO IT, THE TIGER CAN JUST WAIT THE LION OUT. NOW, BOTH HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO CARTOON CHARACTERS, SO THAT'S A TIE. BY THE WAY, IT'S OKAY WHEN THEY CALL EACH OTHER TIGER, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT. ( APPLAUSE ) NOT COOL. PLEASE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT TIGERS HAVE ALMOST TWICE THE BITE FORCE, THEY'RE MUCH FASTER, SO CLEARLY IT'S NO CONTEST. IF A LION FOUGHT A TIGER, TIGER WOULD WIN PAWS DOWN. THEY'VE GOT THE SIZE, THEY'VE GOT STRENGTH, THEY'VE GOT THE STRIPES. AND NOW THEY'VE GOT THE COLBERT BUMP.   ( APPLAUSE ) BESIDE, TIM, YOU HAVE EVER HEARDAVE COWARDLY TYINGER? NO. ( LAUGHTER ) SORRY, LION, YOU MAY BE KING OF THE JUNGLE, BUT TIGERS ARE KING OF WHEREVER TIGERS LIVE. CEREAL AISLE? I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S FOR TIGER VERSUS LION. NOW TIGER WOODS VERSUS LION-EL RICHIE. THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER SEGMENT OF "THE INBOX." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, THEY SAY YOU CAN'T MAKE AN OMELET WITHOUT BREAKING A FEW EGGS. I SAY THEY'VE NEVER TRIED MY WESTERN SCRUNCH SCRAMBLER. THIS IS THOUGHT FOR FOOD. YOU KNOW, I'M ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR INNOVATIONS AND FAST FOODS. THAT'S WHY I WAS SO EXCITED BY THIS NEW CONCEPT IN EATING QUICKLY.
WHAT'S THAT?
KFSK GO-CUP.
THAT LOOKS BETTER THAN THIS.
10-31 IN PROGRESS.
YOU TAKE THIS.
Stephen:  CHICKEN AND FRIES TOGETHER IN A CUP? THIS IS GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY I EAT MEET. IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT A "10-31 IN PROGRESS MEANS" THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL SAYS IT'S AN ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. WHICH-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WE LOOKED IT UP. WE LOOKED IT UP. WHICH, INTENTALLY, IS HOW THE U.S.D.A. CLASSIFIES THE GO-CUP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ED ASTHIS AD MADE ME FOR THE NEW POTATO AND POULTRY BIG GULP, THE K.F.C. SALES DEPARTMENT HAS NOTHING ON THE INTEGRATE THE MARKETING GENIUSES AT FOX NEWS.
K.F.C. RELEASING GO-CUPS HOLDING THE ENTIRE COMBO MEALS, CHICKEN AND FRIES IN EASY REACH. GOOD IDEA.
REVOLUTIONARY CUP IS MADE TO FIT INSIDE YOUR CAR'S CUP HOLDER.
Stephen:  AND THE FOX AND FRIENDS PRODUCT PLACEMENT DID NOT STOP THERE. THEY WERE JOINED ON THE COMFY COUCH BY A TALKING DRUMMED STICK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, THE GO-CUP IS A GOOD IDEA, BUT IT COULD BE GOODER. LAST TIME I CHECKED, THE CUP HOLDER IS STILL AN ARM'S LENGTH AWAY FROM THE OLD GRUB-CHUTE, AND IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN PUT THE GO-CUP BETWEEN YOUR LEGS. THAT'S WHERE THE TUB OF BEN & JERRY'S GOES. ALL THE, EFFECTIVE BIRTH CONTROL. CHILLS DOWN THE SWIRMS. FOLKS, TONIGHT, I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE MY OWN BETTER IDEA, K.F.C.'S WHEEL MEAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YES. THE WHEEL MEAT. IT'S A ONE-PIECE CIRCULAR MACRO-NUGGET THAT MOUNTS SNUGLY ON TO YOUR STEERING COLUMN. YOU GET TWO SAUCES -- HONE MUSTARD ON THE LEFT, AND BARBECUE ON THE RIGHT. AND YOUR CHICKEN GETS SOFT THROUGH THE NATURAL COURSE OF TURNING. AND REMEMBER, IT'S HANDS AT 10 AND 2, MOUTH AT 12. ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN IT'S TIME FOR DE-- DEJERT RAM INTO A TELEPHONE POLE BECAUSE YOUR AIRBAG IS NOW APPLE PIE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NEXT UP, AS A PROUD MALE GROCERY SHOPPER I'M SHOCKED BY A NEW ARTICLE IN THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" THE REPORT THAT MEN ARE DOING A GREATER SHARE OF THE GROCERY SHOPPING AND MEAL PREPARATION. EVEN MORE SHOCK-- THIS IS NOT AN ARTICLE FROM 1952. ( LAUGHTER ) THE GOOD-- LET'S CALL IT NEWS-- IS THAT THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS TAKING NOTICE.
JUST HOW MANLY IS YOUR FOOD? THEY'RE INJECTING TESTOSTERONE FUEL MARKETING INTO THEIR BRAND.
ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS POWERFUL YOGURT. THEY FELT THE YOGURT SECTION FELT OVERLY FEMALE. YOU CAN SEE THE BULL HORNS PROMOTING PROTEIN.
Stephen:  YUP, BULL'S HORNS. THIS YOGURT IS EXTRA MANLY BECAUSE EVIDENTLY IT'S MADE FROM BULL MILK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) VERY DIFFICULT TO ACQUIRE. BUT THE BULL WILL THANK YOU. ( APPLAUSE ) POWERFUL YOGURT, FOLKS, POWERFUL YOGURT IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY PRODUCTS TARGETED AT A NEW BREED OF MALE SHOPPERS THAT MARKETERS ARE CALLING MANFLUENCERS. I CAN TELL YOU, THEY'RE VERY MAN FLEWENTIAL. THEY ALSO MANFLUENCED ME INTO THINKING MANFLUENCE IS A WORD. AND THE TESTOSTERONE DOES NOT STOP WITH THE MACHO COLOR SCHEMES. MARKETERS ARE REBRANDING PRODUCTS WITH MAN-FRIENDLY NAMES LIKE KILLER BREAD, AND ULTIMATE HAMBURGER HELPER. ALTHOUGH, THIS FTHEY REALLY WANTED TO BRO IT UP, THEY'D CALL IT "HAMBURGER SHOPPER." WE'LL BE RIGHT
