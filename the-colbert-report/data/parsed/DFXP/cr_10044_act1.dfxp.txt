WHY WASTE YOUR BREATH, NOTHING CAN BE DONE TO STOP THE  SHOUTING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IF EVERY TIME--
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WE OUGHTTA GET TO IT, ALRIGHT, LET'S GET TO THE BIG STORY. EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IT, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR AND FUTURE FORMER REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNER CHRIS CHRISTIE IS EMBROILED IN A SCANDAL WITH A SIDE OF IMBROGLIO, RECENTLY RELEASED E-MAILS REVEAL HIGH LEVEL CHRISTIE STAFFERS DELIBERATELY SNARLED TRAFFIC LAST SEPTEMBER ON THE BUSIEST BRIDGE IN THE WORLD, THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE, NAMED OF COURSE, FOR ONE OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS, GEORGE W. BRIDGE. PORT AUTHORITY OFFICIALS SHUT DOWN TWO OF THE THREE ACCESS LANES IN THE TOWN OF FORT LEE, NEW JERSEY, CLAIMING IT WAS A SECRET TRAFFIC STUDY BUT IN FACT IT WAS POLITICAL PAYBACK AGAINST THE TOWN'S MAYOR WHO REFUSED TO ENDORSE CHRISTIE'S RE-ELECTION BID. CRITICS ARE BLASTING THE MOVE AS PETTY AND UNPRESIDENTIAL.
WHO DOES STUFF LIKE THIS.
IT CERTAINLY SEEMS PETTY.
IT SEEMS TO PETTY, SO PETTY.
I DO THINK THAT ALL OF THAT MAKES HIM LOOK SMALLER.
AND THAT IS THE FIRST TIME ANYONE HAS EVER SAID THAT ABOUT CHRIS CHRISTIE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THIS AFTER JUST LAST MONTH THE GOVERNOR INSISTED THE GRIDLOCK WAS THE RESULT OF A TRAFFIC STUDY AND LAUGHED OFF ANY ACCUSATIONS.
I WORKED THE CONES, ACTUALLY, ON THAT, UNBENOWNST TO EVERYBODY I WAS ACTUALLY THE GUY OUT THERE I WAS IN OVERALLS AND A HAT SO I WAS-- BUT I ACTUALLY WAS THE GUY WORKING THE CONES OUT THERE.
YOU REALLY ARE NOT SERIOUS WITH THAT QUESTION.
Stephen: YEAH, YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS WITH THAT IN RETROSPECT, EXTREMELY SERIOUS QUESTION. BECAUSE BACK THEN IT WAS RIDICULOUS. ALMOST RIDICULOUS AS THE NAME OF THE POLICE OFFICER WHO ACTUALLY CONED OFF THE LANES, CAPTAIN LICORICE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PHOTO OF THE CAPTAIN. (LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION BETWEEN HIM AND CHRIS CHRISTIE, THEY HAVE NEVER EVEN BEEN SEEN IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER. BUT NATION, EVEN CAPTAIN LICORICE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SAVE THE GOVERNOR FROM NEW REVELATIONS OF DAMNING E-MAILS. FOR MORE ON THE E-MAILS WE TURN TO THE COLBERT REPORT'S SENIOR CNN ANCHOR JAKE TAPPER, JAKE.
THERE IS ONE SENT A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE LANE CLOSURES FROM BRIDGETTE ANNE KELLY, SHE IS A DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR GOVERNOR CHRISTIE TO DAVID WILDSTEIN THE POLITICAL APPOINTEE AT THE PORT AUTHORITY IN CHARGE OF THE BRIDGES AND TUNNELS. BRIDGET ANNE KELLY SAYS, "TIME FOR SOME TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN FORT LEE." AND DAVID WILDSTEIN RESPONDS, "GOT IT." THE MAYOR OF FORT LEE REACHED OUT TO WILDSTEIN SAYING "HELP, PLEASE, IT IS MADDENING," UNQUOTE. WILDSTEIN FORWARDED THE PLEA TO SOMEONE WHOSE NAME HAS BEEN REDACTED IN THESE E-MAILS AND TEXTS, "IS IT WRONG THAT I AM SMILING?" THE PERSON ASKED. NO, WILDSTEIN REPLIED.
Stephen: NO, IT'S NOT WRONG TO BE SMILING, IT'S WRONG TO HAVE SAVED THE TEXT ABOUT YOU SMILING.
