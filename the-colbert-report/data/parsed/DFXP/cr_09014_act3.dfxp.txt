(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE AUTHOR  OF SUCH BEST SEALING LEGAL  THRILLERS AS "THE FIRM."  I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS INTERVIEW TO BE ADAPTED INTO A MOVIE. PLEASE WELCOME JOHN GRISHAM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU, JOHN! THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK! ALL RIGHT. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. IT'S BEEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS. HOW MANY BOOKS HAVE YOU CRANKED  OUT IN THOSE LAST FIVE YEARS.
AT LEAST 12.
Stephen: 12 BOOKS? YOU AND STEPHEN KING, DO YOU  HAVE A CONTEST GOING ON OR  SOMETHING LIKE THAT? WHO CAN -- DO YOU EVER CALL HIM  UP AND GO  "4,500 WORDS TODAY BEYOCH."
NO, BUT HE'LL CALL ME UP AND  SAY THIS IS 48, YOU ONLY HAVE  30. BUT HE GOT PUBLISHED EARLIER  THAN I DID.
Stephen: WOULD YOU GO BACK TO  BEING A LAWYER?
NEVER.
Stephen: WHY NOT?
I WAS STARVING.
Stephen: YOU MUST HAVE SUCKED  AS A LAWYER! (LAUGHTER)
I HAD A LOT OF CLIENTS IN  PRISON.
Stephen: OKAY, THIS IS ONE OF  THE THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT  YOU, OKAY? YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK HERE  CALLED "RACKETEER" ALL RIGHT? SURE IT'S A GREAT BOOK.
IT'S BRILLIANT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THE DUST COVER IS  GRIPPING SO FAR. BUT IN A LOT OF YOUR BOOKS IT'S  LIKE THESE THINGS ARE TROJAN  HORSES TO GET ME TO LIKE THESE  LIBERAL CAUSES LIKE HOMELESSNESS OR THE DEATH PENALTY AND A LOT  OF TIMES THE BAD GUY IS SOME  CORPORATE DUDE. ARE YOU ANTI-CORPORATE AMERICA?
NOT COMPLETELY.
Stephen: UH-HUH. SOME OF THEM! THERE'S SOME GOOD ONES!
THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD  CORPORATIONS.
Stephen: WHAT'S WRONG WITH  HOMELESSNESS?
ARE YOU ATTACKING HOMELESS  PEOPLE?
Stephen: ONLY WHEN THEY ASK  FOR THINGS FROM A THE  GOVERNMENT. THAT IS MY MONEY, I WORKED HARD  FOR THE MONEY AND I DON'T SEE  WHY IT SHOULD GO TO SOME BUM WHO  CAN'T GET OFF HIS ASS AND WRITE A BEST-SELLING NOVEL. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  OR HOST A TELEVISION SHOW! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW THE BOOK ITSELF IS ABOUT A  BUNCH OF JUDGES THAT GET KILLED,  RIGHT?
JUST ONE.
Stephen: JUST ONE JUDGE?
ONLY TWO DEAD BODIES WHICH IS  KIND OF LIGHT FOR ME. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: REALLY? OFF DAY?
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: KILLING A JUDGE IN A  BOOK, IS THAT FAN FICTION FOR  YOU?
SURE.
Stephen: IS THAT FANTASY  FICTION?
EVERY LAWYER WANTS TO DO THAT  I FELT THAT WAY WHEN I WAS A  LAWYER, THERE WERE A BUNCH I  WANTED TO KILL. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: PEOPLE SAY WRITE  ABOUT WHAT YOU WHAT YOU KNOW --  (LAUGHTER)  JOHN GRISHAM, IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL US? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT  IT IS BUT ARE THERE ANY THINGS  THAT YOU'VE DONE THAT ARE ILLEGAL THAT YOU WOULD WANT A  BETTER LAWYER THAN YOU DEFENDING  YOU? (LAUGHTER)
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING  I'VE DONE THAT'S, LIKE, REALLY  ILLEGAL. MAYBE SOME SPEEDING, GOING OVER  55 MILES AN HOUR, SOMETHING LIKE  THAT. A LITTLE MINI INCOME TAX  CHEATING. NOT ADMITTING ANYTHING BUT MAYBE  MAYBE.
Stephen: THAT'S OKAY. TELL US ABOUT THE NBLG TAX.
A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: THE I.R.S. HAS A  GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR. (LAUGHTER)
OH, THEY'VE GOT A FILE ON ME,  YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK SO?
WE'VE HAD ISSUES OVER THE  YEARS.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER DONE A  FOYA REQUEST ON YOURSELF?
A WHAT?
Stephen: FOYA REQUEST?
OH, FREEDOM OF INFORMATION?
Stephen: DO I KNOW MORE ABOUT  THE LAW THAN YOU DO? IS THAT WHAT THAT IS? (LAUGHTER)  FOYE YA. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT  WRITING SOMETHING OTHER THAN  LAWYERS? HAVE YOU WRITTEN BOOKS ABOUT  ANYTHING OTHER THAN LAWYERS?
I'VE WRITTEN A COUPLE BOOKS  ABOUT FOOTBALL, A BOOK ABOUT  BASEBALL, A BOOK ABOUT -- A  COUPLE COMIC NOVEL BUS I ALWAYS COME BACK TO THE LAW, THAT'S  WHEY WHAT I KNOW. I COULDN'T WRITE ABOUT  ARCHITECTS OR DENTISTS OR  ANYTHING YOU KNOW. THEY WOULDN'T SELL. PEOPLE LOVE STORIES ABOUT  LAWYERS, ESPECIALLY CROOKED  LAWYERS AND DEAD JUDGES. THIS STUFF SELLS. (LAUGHTER)  IT SELLS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT TO GO  WITH WHAT YOU KNOW. JOHN GRISHAM, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE BOOK IS "THE RACKETEER
