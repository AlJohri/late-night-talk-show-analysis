TONIGHT THE STILL  PERSECUTED MINORITY, DON'T  WORRY BROWN PEOPLE, WE'LL  GET BACK TO YOU.
THEN IS A CANDIDATE'S  HOBBY FAIR GAME FOR CAMPAIGN  ATTACKS. WELL, ROMNEY'S HOBBY IS  CAMPAIGNING. AND MY GUEST FORMER  ASTRONAUT MARK KELLEY HAS  WRITTEN A NEW CHILDREN'S  BOOK. GOOD NIGHT MOON PROGRAM. IT'S COLUMBUS DAY, DON'T  ANOTHER GET TO INFECT AN  INDIAN. -- TO INFECT AN INDIAN. THIS IS "THE COLBERT  REPORT."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU,  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I THINK YOU CAN TELL BY THE  ENERGY ENERGY IN THIS ROOM  WE GET IT ON MOST EVERY  NIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. NATION, I AM STILL GLOWING  FROM LAST WEEK'S RUNNAWAY  DEBATE VICTORY FOR MITT  ROMNEY. HE'S GOT THE MITT-MENTUM. THE MO-MITT-NUM. THE ROM-NENTUM. THERE'S STILL NO WORD FOR IT,  IT'S NEVER EXISTED BEFORE. HE GOT A BUMP IN THE POLLS. CAMPAIGN DONATIONS ARE  ROLLING IN. IT'S ALL GOOD NEWS!
A SEPTEMBER JOBS REPORT  WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBER  NOW DOWN TO 7.8%, THE LOWEST  RATE SINCE THE PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE.
Stephen: EXCEPT FOR ANY  NEWS THAT IS ACTUALLY GOOD. (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, THIS .3% DROP IN THE  UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEMS JUST  A LITTLE TOO BARELY BETTER  THAN TRUE.
MAYBE IT'S A COINCIDENCE.
A MONTH BEFORE THE  ELECTION WE HAVE A NUMBER  THAT COMES OUT 1/10 BELOW  WHEN THE PRESIDENT TOOK  OFFICE.
I'M NOT A HUGE CONSPIRACY  THEORIST BUT I WILL GO WITH  JACK WELCH.
HOW CONVENIENT THE RATE  DROPS BELOW 8% FOR THE FIRST  TIME IN 43 MONTHS FIVE WEEKS  BEFORE AN ELECTION.
RIGHT BACK TO WHERE IT  WAS JANUARY 2009.
THE HEADLINE RIGHT NOW.
COINKIDINK.
Stephen: FOLKS, THIS IS  MORE THAN A COINKIDINK, IT  IS A FULL PLEDGE-- FLEDGE  CONSPIRAA-DINKI-DOINK. AND THE HEAD OF HUFFLEPUFF  IS RIGHT. OH, HOW CONVENIENT, QUICK  SOMEONE ALERT THE ACCOUNTANT. SHE WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM  OF THIS OR DOWNTOWN HANNY  WILL FEEL HER [BLEEP] (APPLAUSE)  MARY POPPINS! NOW FOLKS WE ALL KNOW THE  BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS  ARE COOKING THE BOOKS FOR  THEIR BUDDY OBAMA. OF COURSE THEY VOW THERE'S  NO CONSPIRACY CLAIMS BEFORE  THE NUMBER IS EVER RELEASED  THERE IS AN EIGHT DAY SECURITY LOCKDOWN DURING  WHICH CONFIDENTIALITY  AGREEMENTS ARE SIGNED EACH  MORNING AND COMPUTERS ARE ENCRYPTED AND DATA LOCKED  INTO A SAFE EVERY TIME ONE  OF THE ANALYSTS GOES EVEN TO  THE BATHROOM. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN  THEY'RE RELEASING ALL THE  NUMBERS. WHEN THOSE ANALYST GOES TO  THE BATHROOM IS IT NUMBER  ONE OR NUMBER TWO. AMERICA NEEDS TO KNOW! AND FOLKS, THIS THING IS TOO  BIG FOR THE BUREAU OF LABOR  STATISTICS TO HAVE DONE IT  ALL ALONE. IT HAS TO GO ALL THE WAY UP  TO THE BOTTOM. THINK ABOUT IT. LAST MONTH 114,000  UNEMPLOYED MOOCHERS. THE PRESIDENT'S NATURAL  ALLIES, SUDDENLY YANK THE  GOVERNMENT TEAT OUT OF THEIR  MOUTHS, GET OFF THE COUCH FOR 40 HOURS A WEEK, WHY? I SAY FOLLOW THE MONEY  BECAUSE I FOUND OUT THAT  RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THOSE  PEOPLE GOT THOSE JOBS, THEY STARTED GETTING PAID. (LAUGHTER)  AND JUST WHERE DOES THAT  MONEY COME FROM? RIGHT OUT OF THE POCKETS OF  THE JOB CREATE EVERS. HOW'S THAT FOR YOUR  SOCIALIST REDISTRIBUTION OF  WEALTH. FOLKS, IT'S CALLED CLASS  WARFARE, AND THE PRESIDENT  LOVES IT. IT'S ALL LAID OUT IN A NEW  RECENT NEW YORKER ARTICLE. NOW I TRY HARD NOT TO READ  "THE NEW YORKER", BECAUSE I  NEVER WIN THEIR CARTOON  CAPTION CONTEST. THAT COUPLE SLEEPING IN THE  GRAVEYARD, THANKS A LOT, GAY  MARRIAGE. NEVER. THE LAST WEEK I MADE AN  EXCEPTION BECAUSE "THE NEW  YORKER" HAD A GREAT PIECE OF  A NEW VILIFIED UNDERCLASS. THE RICH. AND THE SIGNS OF THIS  OPPRESSION ARE EVERYWHERE,  FOLKS. FOR INSTANCE, IN THE POST  CRASS STOCK MARKET RECOVERY  THE TOP 1% OF EARNERS ONLY  GOT 93% OF THE GAINS. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT OTHER  7%, MR. PRESIDENT? DID IT GO FOR BIRTH CONTROL  FOR THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD? SOLYNDRA STOCK OPTION FOR  THE BLACK PANTHERS? WHERE? OBAMA'S BLATANT  DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WALL  STREET HAS CREATED A CRISIS. AND THAT CRISIS IS THE  SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IT'S NOT EASY  HAVING GREEN. FOLKS, LAST YEAR THE TOP 500  C.E.O.s EARNED $5.2 BILLION. THE WEALTHY ARE PAYING THEIR  LOWEST TAX RATES SINCE THE  1950s AND LAST WEEK THE DOW  CLOSED AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL IN FIVE YEARS. AMERICA'S SUPERRICH ARE  HAVING A GOOD DECADE. BUT FOLKS-- THEY CAN'T ENJOY  IT BECAUSE BARACK OBAMA HAS  HURT THEIR FEELINGS. ONE FUND, ONE FUND MANAGER  SAID THE PRESIDENT SHOWED  DISDAIN FOR THE RICH. WHILE ANOTHER ACCUSED HIM OF  BULLYING. AND A THIRD SAID BECAUSERS  WHO STILL SUPPORT OBAMA ARE  LIKE BATTERED WIVES. YES. THESE BILLIONAIRES ARE LIKE  BATTERED WIVES. THEY SHOULD REALLY GO TO A  SHELL TER. WELL, FOLKS, THE WEALTHY  HAVE HAD IT. THE WEALTHY WILL NOW  FIGHTING BACK WITH THEIR  LEADER, HEDGE FUND FOUNDER  WILL OBJECT COOPERMAN WHO  HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE POPE OF THIS MOVEMENT WELL,  POPE ISN'T REALLY FAIR. HE HAS MORE GOALS THAN THE  VAT BEGAN-- VATICAN. AS WE SPEAK TOM HANKS IS  SEARCHING FOR CLUES IN HIS  BASEMENT. (LAUGHTER)  ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE IN  "THE NEW YORKER", COOPERMAN  LAUNCHED HIS CRUSADE AFTER  HEARING THESE HATEFUL WORDS.
IF YOU ARE'S-- IF YOU ARE  A WEALTHY C.E.O. OR HEDGE  FUND MANAGER IN AMERICA  RIGHT NOW, YOUR TAXES ARE LOWER THAN THEY HAVE EVER  BEEN. THEY'RE LOWER THAN THEY HAVE  BEEN SINCE THE 1950s. AND YOU CAN AFFORD IT. YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE TO RIDE  ON YOUR CORPORATE JET. WILL YOU JUST HAVE TO PAY A  LITTLE MORE.
Stephen: PAY MORE. FOR MY PRIVATE JET? WHY NOT JUST MAKE ME TAKE  THE SHIN-WU CHINATOWN BUS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  OR WORSE, DELTA. EITHER WAY YOUR CHICKEN  RIDES FOR FREE. NOW COOPERMAN KNOWS-- COOPERMAN  KNOWS THAT STATEMENT BY THE  PRESIDENT IS QUOTE A  DECLARATION OF CLASS WARFARE SAYING OBAMA IS, QUOTE, NOT  TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ADOLF  HITLER IN GERMANY. YES, IN SOME WAYS VERY  SIMILAR. YOU SEE, COOPERMAN HAS ONLY  ONE DEMAND. HE WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY  HIGHER TAXES IF HE WAS  TREATED WITH RESPECT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY  ABOUT RESPECT, IF YOU HAVE  TO ASK, YOU DESERVE IT. BUT THE PRESIDENT SEEMS  UNWILLING TO GIVE THEM THAT  RESPECT, BUT I AM. TO SOOTHE THE WOUNDED SPIRIT  OF OUR JOB CREATORS, I HAVE  CREATED THE OFFICIAL STEPHEN  COLBERT CERTIFICATE OF  RICHNESS. IT PROCLAIMS--   (APPLAUSE)  IT PROCLAIMS THAT THE HOLD  HOLDER OF THIS DOCUMENT HAS  AMASSED INCONCEIVABLE WEALTH THAT HE TRULY DESERVES AND  MORE IMPORTANTLY, SOMEONE  LIKES HIM. AVAILABLE FOR ONE MILLION  DOLLARS ON WHICH I WILL PAY  TAXES IF I AM SHOWN RESPECT. AND FOLKS--   (LAUGHTER)
RIGHT NOW THIS MOVEMENT  DOESN'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL  NAME. SO I AM ALSO FORMING A NEW  POLITICAL PARTY TO GIVE  BILLIONAIRES THE RESPECT  THEY DESERVE. I CALL IT THE PROTECTING  INDUSTRY TITANS AND  YACHTSMAN PARTY OR PITTY  PARTY. SO PERCENT KULTED RICH,  JOIN-- PERSECUTED RICH, JOIN  THE PITTY PARTY BECAUSE  OBAMA MIGHT BE RE-ELECTED. AND IF HE'S WILLING TO SAY  THAT HE WANTS TO GO AFTER  WALL STREET IN HIS FIRST  TERM, THERE'S A CHANCE HE MIGHT ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING  IN HIS SECOND. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
