Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT THINKS THAT SOME ANIMALS DESERVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS HUMANS. PLEASE WELCOME STEVEN WISE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MR. WISE, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ALL RIGHT, SIR, THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. I GOT A COUPLE WARNINGS RIGHT UP FRONT, OKAY. YOU WANT-- YOU'RE A LAWYER RIGHT.
I AM.
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ANIMALS THE SAME RIGHTS AS HUMANS HAVE. IN A COURT OF LAW.
I'M TRYING TO GET A CHIMPANZEE THE RIGHT TO GET OUT OF A CAGE ON A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.
Stephen: OKAY SO, HUMANS, FIRST OF ALL-- DON'T WORRY, I'LL GET HIM. NOW-- WHAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT HERE. ANIMALS ARE ANIMALS, HUMANS ARE HUMANS, NEVER THE TWAIN SHALL MEET, READ YOUR BIBLE. WHAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT.
A CHIMPANZEE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY BEING. SHE IS AUTONOMOUS. SHE CAN BE DID --.
Stephen: WHAT DOES AUTONOMOUS MEAN.
THAT'S WHAT JUDGES ASK.
Stephen: YEAH.
IT MEANS THAT SHE CAN THINK ABOUT THE PAST. SHE CAN THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE. SHE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW SHE WANTS TO LIVE HER LIFE. SHE CAN SELF-DETERMINE. AND THESE ARE THE SAME THINGS THAT MAKE US SO IMPORTANT THAT MAKE US WANT TO FILE WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS WHEN WE ARE THROWN IN HUMAN JAIL, WHEN SHE IS THROWN IN CHIMPANZEE JAIL.
Stephen: YOU SAY BECAUSE AN ANIMAL IS AUTONOMOUS, THAT SOME ANIMAL CAN MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THEIR LIFE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE HABEAS CORPUS.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: THAT'S AN ARGUMENT SAYING SHIA LABEOUF SHOULD NOT HAVE HABEAS CORPUS.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST SAID. YOU GOT A BOOK HERE. A "NEW YORK TIMES" SUNDAY MAGAZINE HERE, HIS DAY IN COURT, OKAY. THIS IS ABOUT ONE, AT LEAST ONE OF YOUR CHIMPS THERE.
TOMMY.
Stephen: TOMMY, HE'S A CHIMP. WE HAVE A PICTURE OF TOMMY UP HERE.
THAT'S TOMMY.
Stephen: LET'S TAKE IT DOWN BECAUSE IT IS SAD MAKING. LET'S TAKE THAT DOWN. OKAY, WHY, WHY DOES TOMMY WANT OUT?
TOMMY WANTS OUT BECAUSE HE'S A CHIMPANZEE
Stephen: HAS HE TOLD YOU.
HE HAS NOT TOLD ME.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T LIKE WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW.
BECAUSE JANE GOODALL AND OTHER PEOPLE TOLD ME THAT NO CHIMPANZEE WANTS TO BE KEPT LIKE THAT.
Stephen: OKAY, BUT MAN HAS DOMINION OVER ANIMALS, RIGHT?
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
Stephen: YES. WELL-- WELL, WE EAT THEM. WE BETTER, ARE YOU A VEGETARIAN.
NOT TOMMY. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EAT TOMMY.
Stephen: NOT IF YOU LET HIM OUT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OKAY, BUT THIS REALLY DOES, YOU'VE ALSO GOT A BOOK THAT'S OUT IN PAPERBACK NOW, RE-RELEASED CALLED RATTLING THE CAGE TOWARD LEGAL RIGHT FOR ANIMALS.
YES.
Stephen: YOU'RE ON YOUR WEB SITE HERE 2003 YOU SAID OUR GOAL IS TO BREACH THE LEGAL WALL THAT SEPARATES ALL HUMANS FROM ALL NONHUMAN ANIMALS. THIS CASE IS JUST THE BEGINNING. THIS IS THE CAMEL'S NOSE UNDER THE TENT FLAP AND THEN THE CAMEL GETS HABAEUS CORPUS TOO. WHY SHOULD ALL ANIMALS HAVE LEGAL STANDING? >>.
THEY SHOULDN'T. WE AREN'T SAY-- .
Stephen: ALL NONHUMAN ANIMALS, YOUR WORDS.
I THINK YOU'RE TWISTING THOSE WORDS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I ACCURATELY QUOTED THOSE WORDS.
OUR GOAL IS TO BREACH THE LEGAL WALL THAT SEPARATES ALL HUMANS FROM ALL NONHUMAN ANIMALS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AGAIN, YOU ARE TAKING MANKIND OFF OF THE TOP OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHART IF YOU ALLOW ANIMALS TO ALSO HAVE LEGAL STANDING. THEN MY DOG CAN SUE TO GET ON MY COUCH.
I DIDN'T SAY YOUR DOG, I SAID YOUR CHIMPANZEE AND YOUR ELEPHANT AND YOUR-- .
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST MY DOG.
NO,-- I WILL GIVE MY CARD, YOU GIVE THE CARD TO YOUR DOG. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHY IS TOMMY IN PRISON RIGHT NOW, WHAT DID HE DO?
HE WAS BORN A CHIMPANZEE. AND BECAUSE HE'S A CHIMPANZEE HE'S OUR SLAVE. WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT TO HIM. AND THE FOLKS THAT ARE KEEPING HIM ARE KEEPING HIM IN THE WAY YOU JUST SAW. THEY ARE ALLOWED TO KEEP THEM IN THOSE KINDS OF CONDITIONS. WE WANT TO GET THEM OUT.
Stephen: AND WHAT YOUR DESIRE FOR TOMMY DOES TO OUR LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE STANDING OF MANKIND, AND OUR PRIMACY IN OUR VISION OF THE UNIVERSE IS JUST, JUST WRECKAGE ON THE WAY TO YOUR MAD GOAL TO RELEASE ONE CHIMP.
A SIMPLE YES OR NO. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
WHAT IS DOES IS IT SHOWS THAT WE CAN EXTEND JUSTICE TO WHEREVER THERE SHOULD BE JUSTICE, WHETHER WE ARE DEALING WITH A HUMAN OR ANY OTHER BEING.
Stephen: LISTEN IF TOMMY WANTS TO HAVE RIGHTS-- IF TOMMY-- IF TOMMY WANTS TO HAVE RIGHTS AS A PERSON HE SHOULD FORM HIS OWN CORPORATION. (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: STEVEN WISE. THE BOOK IS RATTLING THE CAGE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
