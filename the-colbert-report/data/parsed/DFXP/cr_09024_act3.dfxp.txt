(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH NEWT  GINGRICH. ALL RIGHT. LAST TUESDAY MITT ROMNEY DID NOT  BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES. YOU PREDICTED THAT MITT ROMNEY  WOULD WIN IN A LANDSLIDE. WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, THAT'S ONE OF THE  REASONS I WANTED TO COME BE ON  THE SHOW?
TO CONFESS THAT YOU WERE  SMOKING CRACK? (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A  LANDSLIDE, TOO, BUT I WAS  SMOKING CRACK. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen:
I JUST KNEW THAT I WAS WRONG.
Stephen: YOU KNEW YOU WERE  WRONG AFTERWARDS, YOU DIDN'T  KNOW YOU WERE WRONG BEFOREHAND.
EXACTLY. BUT SOME TIME TUESDAY NIGHT IT  OCCURRED TO ME. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OKAY. OKAY. NOW IN THE PRIMARIES YOU CALLED  MITT ROMNEY A LIAR AND YOU SAID  THAT HE'S FUNDAMENTALLY DISHONEST AND WHY SHOULD WE  EXPECT HIM TO BE HONEST ABOUT  ANYTHING IF HE'S PRESIDENT. WHAT CHANGED FOR YOU WHEN YOU  ENDORSED HIM? DID YOU CHANGE YOUR FEELINGS  ABOUT HIM OR DID YOU CHANGE YOUR  FEELINGS ABOUT LIARS?
IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN HE AND  OBAMA AND I THOUGHT FOR MY  CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN'S FUTURE HE WAS LESS OF A PROBLEM  THAN THE PRESIDENT WAS.
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE  CONSERVATIVES ARE LIVING IN THIS  BUBBLE WHERE WE JUST TALK TO EACH OTHER AND DON'T BELIEVE IN  REALITY AND WE'VE GOT TO GET  OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE. DO YOU BELIEVE WE'RE JUST  TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND LIVE  IN A BUBBLE OR DO WE BELIEVE IN  REALITY.
I WROTE A PIECE FOR POLITICO  THAT HA SAID REPUBLICANS AND  CONSERVATIVES SHOULD STOP AND ANALYZE THIS ELECTION AND THINK  IT THROUGH BECAUSE WE WERE WRONG  AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT REALITY AND YOU HAVE TO  ASK YOURSELF WHY WAS IT  DIFFERENT THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE? I'LL GIVE YOU JUST ONE EXAMPLE. ROMNEY DID WORSE WITH ASIAN  AMERICANS THAN WITH LATINO  AMERICANS. NOW, NOBODY ON THE REPUBLICAN  SIDE LOOKED AT THAT AND THOUGHT  ABOUT IT. THAT SHOULD BE VERY TROUBLING. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T GO TO A  WAL-MART OR A COSTCO OR TARGET  AND SAY "THE CUSTOMERS ARE REALLY STUPID, THEY PICKED THE  WRONG STORE LAST WEEK."  YOU GO AND YOU SAY "WHAT IS IT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT WHAT THE  CUSTOMER NEEDED? " AND YOU CAN DO IT AS A  CONSERVATIVE.
Stephen: BUT HOW DO WE REACH  OUT TO THE LATINOS AND THE HIS  PANICOS OUT THERE WHEN THE CANDIDATE THAT WE JUST SUPPORTED  SAID THEY SHOULD SELF-DEPORT. THAT'S AN UNPOPULAR -- WE CAN'T  JUST GO 180. WE CAN'T JUST SAY --
WELL, 180 WOULD BE  SELF-IMPORT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WHICH IS WHAT  THEY'VE BEEN DOING. THAT'S CALLED CROSSING THE  BORDER. THAT'S CROSSING THE BORDER,  EXACTLY.
YOU CAN BE FOR CONTROLLING  THE BORDER. IT'S OKAY.
Stephen: CAN WE TALK SUPER  PACS FOR A SECOND?
IF YOU WANT TO.
Stephen: I HAD A SUPER PAC,  YOU WERE HELPED BY SHELDON ADELE  SON WHO CONTRIBUTED TO A SUPER PAC IN YOUR FAVOR.
YES.
DO YOU BELIEVE SUPER PACS ARE  THE RIGHT THING OR THE WRONG  THING FOR AMERICA?
I THINK AMERICA WOULD BE MUCH  BETTER OFF TO HAVE A VERY CLEAN,  SIMPLE ELECTION LAW THAT SAYS ANYONE CAN GIVE ANY AMOUNT OF  AFTER TAX PERSONAL INCOME TO THE  CANDIDATE AS LONG AS THEY REPORT IT EVERY NIGHT. I THINK SUPER PACS AS SUCH ARE,  IN FACT, VERY DANGEROUS IN THE  LONG RUN. WHEN YOU SIGH MAYOR BLOOMBERG  PUT A MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED  THOUSAND INTO A DEMOCRATIC DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA TO BEAT  SOMEBODY, THERE'S SOMETHING  FUNDAMENTALLY PROFOUNDLY WRONG ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND IT'S HAPPENING IN BOTH  PARTIES AND IN THE LONG RUN IT'S  GOING TO BE VERY NEGATIVE AND VERY DISRUPTIVE OF OUR SYSTEM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THERE WAS SOME TALK THAT --  SOME PEOPLE SAID THAT ONE OF THE  THINGS THAT HURT ROMNEY IS THAT YOU AND RICK SANTORUM WERE  HELPED BY THESE SUPER PACS AND  STAYED IN LONG ENOUGH THAT KIND OF BLED ROMNEY DRY, ALLOWED YOU  TO ATTACK HIM, TO SAY THESE  THINGS THAT I SAID BEFORE AND ALSO DEPLETED HIS CAMPAIGN  COFFERS. DID THE SUPER PACS HURT  REPUBLICANS MORE THAN THEY  HELPED THEM?
I HAD ONE BILLIONAIRE, A GOOD  FRIEND AND A PERSON WHO'S DEEPLY  PASSIONATE ABOUT --.
Stephen: GREAT FRIEND TO  HAVE. BILLIONAIRES ARE SOME OF THE  BEST TO HAVE.
I'D LIKE TO HAVE TEN OR 15. ROMNEY HAD ABOUT 26. IT TURNED OUT 26 BILLIONAIRES  BEAT ONE. THIS WAS A GREAT REVELATION TO  US. (LAUGHTER)  SO I THINK ROMNEY --.
Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT  REALITY SHOW "BILLIONAIRE  FIGHT."  (LAUGHTER)
WE JUST HAD IT, IT WAS CALLED  THE ELECTION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IT'S NOT GOING TO  GET BETTER THAN THAT. NEWT GINGRICH, THANK YOU SO  MUCH. SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH. THE BOOK IS
