(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: NATION, I BELIEVE THAT MY BODY IS A TEMPLE. WHICH IS WHY I'VE APPLIED FOR A TAX EXEMPTION.. SO I'M ALWAYS KEEPING UP WITH THE LATEST IN WEARABLE SPORT-TECH. IF I FORGET TO HIT THE GYM, MY FITBIT JUST SYNCHS TO MY PEBBLE, WHICH SENDS A REMINDER TO MY IPHONE, WHICH I DELETE WITH  GOOGLE GLASS. (LAUGHTER) GOODBYE. REPEATED NAGGING MESSAGES DON'T MOTIVATE ME. IF THEY DID, I'D HAVE A LINKED-IN ACCOUNT. (LAUGHTER) STOP IT! I DO NOT WANT TO CONNECT WITH DAVE! I HAD COFFEE WITH HIM ONCE! BUT FINALLY, THERE'S A SMART-TECH DEVICE. THAT CAN JOLT AMERICANS INTO ACTION.
MEET THE NEWEST FITNESS CRAZE. THIS IS THE PAVLOCK. THAT BRACELET CLAIMS TO ZAP USERS IF THEY STOP EXERCISING. IF YOU DON'T GET MOVING, IT'S GOING TO SHOCK YOU. YEAH, IT SENDS 400 VOLTS, ELECTRICAL JOLTS RIGHT INTO THE ARM.
STEPHEN: YES, IF YOU DO NOT EXERCISE, YOU GET AN ELECTRIC SHOCK. AND, FOR ONCE, IT'S NOT FROM THE EMTS OF COURSE, THE PAVLOK IS NAMED FOR RUSSIAN BEHAVIORAL PIONEER IVAN PAVLOV, WHO CONDITIONED DOGS TO SALIVATE EVERY TIME HE RANG A BELL, HENCE THE EXPRESSION, "EVERY TIME A BELL RINGS, AN ANGEL GETS HIS. WINGS COVERED IN DOG SALIVA." (LAUGHTER) AND BY USING PSYCHOLOGICALLY PROVEN AND USER TESTED ALGORITHMS, THE PAVLOK WRISTBAND ENFORCES USERS' COMMITMENTS TO FITNESS, PRODUCTIVITY AND MORE. YES, THE SAME PROVEN PRODUCTIVITY ALGORITHMS THAT USE ELECTRICITY TO ENFORCE CATTLE TOWARD THE "GYM." (LAUGHTER) YEAH, THOSE COWS COULD REALLY PULL A MUSCLE IN THERE. (LAUGHTER) REMEMBER TO STRETCH OUT, BESSIE! (LAUGHTER) AND IF ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY DOESN'T MOVE YOUR FAT ASS, THE SYNCHRONIZED PAVLOK APP WILL ALSO ZAP YOU WHERE IT 'REALLY' HURTS BECAUSE -- IF THE USER HASN'T COMPLETED THEIR GOAL, THEY GET CHARGED MONEY THROUGH THE APP AND POSTS ON YOUR FACEBOOK WALL "I DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE GYM TODAY." (LAUGHTER) AND THAT'S JUST THE MOTIVATION YOU NEED WHEN YOU'RE IN A DARK PLACE, OUT OF SHAPE, AT HOME, TOO TIRED TO WORK OUT, IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T GETTING ENOUGH PUBLIC HUMILIATION. (LAUGHTER) WHILE PAVLOK'S A GOOD START, I BELIEVE THE PAIN AND SHAME OF SURRENDERING YOUR WILL TO AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE CAN GO MUCH FURTHER. WHICH IS WHY I'M THRILLED TO BE PART OF A NEW WEARABLE FITNESS PILOT PROGRAM I HEARD ABOUT THROUGH MY FINANCIAL ADVISOR, GORLOCK. IT'S CALLED "THE SPINE SPIDER." HERE'S HOW IT WORKS -- PLACE IT ANYWHERE ON OR NEAR YOUR BODY AND IT WILL CRAWL TO AND EMBED ITS NEUROPINCERS IN YOUR SPINAL COLUMN. NO RECHARGING NECESSARY. IT FEEDS ON YOUR BLOOD! AND WHAT A WORKOUT. THE SPINE-SPIDER TAKES OVER YOUR MOTOR FACULTIES, AND MARCHES YOU INTO A FIELD WHERE YOU -- BUILD A LARGE CRYSTAL PYRAMID. WHAT'S THE PYRAMID FOR? WHY DOES GORLOCK NEED IT? WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN IT'S FINISHED? WITH SPINE SPIDER, YOUR BRAIN IS PREVENTED FROM THINKING THOSE QUESTIONS. (LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, I HAVE BEEN USING THE THE SPINE SPIDER FOR WEEKS AND LIFTING MYSTERIOUS PRISMS AT THE BEHEST OF AN UNKNOWN ALIEN OVERLORD  HAS DONE WONDERS FOR MY CORE. BUT DON'T LOOK FOR SPINE SPIDER AT YOUR NEAREST ELECTRONICS STORE -- SPINE SPIDER WILL FIND YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
