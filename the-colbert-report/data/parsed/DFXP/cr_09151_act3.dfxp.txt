Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. OUR GUEST TONIGHT HAS A BOOK CALLED "THE TRAVELING SPRINKLER." IT'S LIKE "ON THE ROAD" BUT FOR SPRINKLERS. PLEASE WELCOME NICHOLSON BAKER. PLEASE WELCOME NICHOLSON BAKER. YOU'VE WRITTEN NINE NOVELS INCLUDING AND FIVE NON-FICTION BOOKS. YOUR LATEST IS A NOVEL CALLED TRAVELING WITH SPRINKLERS. WOULD YOU ALSO THROW IN THE GARDEN WEASEL $40 VALUE ABSOLUTELY FREE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE TRAVELING SPRINKLEERS THE REASON I CHOSE IT FOR TITLE OF THE BOOK IS BECAUSE I WANTED TO THINK ABOUT THE WAY WE WE LIVE -- WE LIVE BY -- SWRE A KIND OF GARDEN OF THOUGHT, MAYBE. THE THINGS THAT WE'RE PREOCCUPIED BY AND WE ARRANGE A HOSE AROUND THOSE THINGS AND WE PUT THE TRAVELING SPRINKLER ON IT AND WE WET IT.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE TRAVELING SPRINKLER. ARE WE TRAVELING SPRINKLER OR ARE WE THE GUARD SGLN WE ARE THE TRAVELING SPRINKLER.
Stephen: AND WE TRAVEL THROUGH THE GARDEN OF OUR LIFE.
WE DO.
Stephen: WHO SETS THE HOSE DOWN? WHO PAYS THE WATER BILL? (LAUGHTER)
WE -- WE DO IT ALL. WE START, WE SET IT UP, WE WATCH IT HAPPEN AND THEN WE'RE DONE.
Stephen: WE DO ALL OF IT.
YES.
Stephen: WE SHOULD GET SOME HELP. (LAUGHTER) CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE GARDEN FOR A SECOND BECAUSE I LIKE THAT -- IT'S A METAPHOR. IS THAT A MET SNORE.
Stephen:
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I.
Stephen: I DON'T, ACTUALLY. I'VE NEVER WRITTEN FICTION. A METAPHOR IS WHEN SOMETHING IS SOMETHING ELSE. LIKE YOUR BEARD IS ALL CHRISTMAS. (LAUGHTER)
YES, YES. IT USED TO BE KIND OF DARKER. IT WAS AN AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN KIND OF THING.
Stephen: YOUR BEARD USED TO BE AMERICA. AND THE BEARD WAS A METAPHOR FOR AMERICA AND NOW IT'S A METAPHOR FOR CHRISTMAS!
IT TURNED WHITE AND I THOUGHT WELL, GO WITH IT.
Stephen: CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING? HOW ABOUT DOWNTOWN? IS IT, UM -- (LAUGHTER) ALSO WHITE? THE LOWER LOCKER? IS IT -- (LAUGHTER)
YOU ARE INTIMATE!
Stephen: WELL, YOUR BOOKS ARE VERY INTIMATE. YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF NAMES IN YOUR BOOKS FOR THE TWIGS AND BERRIES DOWN THERE. YOU CALL IT THE THUNDER STICK, IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL IT?
I THINK THAT THERE ARE --.
Stephen: YOU DO. YOU CALL IT THE THUNDER STICK.
P YOU -- I DO.
Stephen: YOU'VE CALLED IT THE MALCOLM GLADWELL.
Stephen:
I'VE CALLED IT THE MALCOLM GLADWELL.
Stephen: WHAT DOES MALCOLM GLADWELL THINK OF THAT?
I DON'T KNOW. BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A COMPLEMENT.
Stephen: YOU NAMED YOUR PENIS AFTER --
NOT MY PENIS.
Stephen: OKAY, I APOLOGIZE. LOOK
LOOK, THE WE US IN IS A BAD WORD FOR WHAT WE HAVE. IT'S NOT A GOOD WORD. THERE ARE ALL THESE WORDS WE HAVE FOR SEXUAL PIECES OF OURSELVES AND THEY'RE ALL BADLY DESIGNED. SOMEBODY CAME UP WITH THEM A LONG TIME AGO AND WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH NEW WORDS FOR THEM. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: LET'S GET BACK TO THAT GARDEN FOR A SECOND. (LAUGHTER) IS A GARDEN -- LET'S SAY CALL THE GARDEN FOR THE MIND FOR A SECOND, CAN WE DO THAT?
YES.
Stephen: YOU SOMETIMES DRILL DOWN. YOU HAVE SUCH AN INTRICATE LEVEL OF PLANTS IN YOUR -- IN YOUR GARDEN. FIRM THE MEZZANINE YOUR CHARACTER IS -- IT TAKES PLACE GOING UP AN ESCALATOR. IT'S ABOUT A FIVE-MINUTE TRIP THAT TAKES A 200 PAGE BOOK.
IT'S A TRAVEL BOOK.
Stephen: YES, IT'S A TRAVEL BOOK. IT IS. IT IS. BUT IT'S ALMOST A SCHIZOPHRENIC LEVEL OF DETAIL IN THE THINGS YOU WRITE. YOU SEE PATTERNS ALL OVER THE PLACE. SOMETIMES WHERE MAYBE PATTERNS DON'T EXIST. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF YOUR WRITING AS A CRY FOR HELP? (LAUGHTER)
I LOOK AT IT DIFFERENTLY. I THINK YOU REALLY -- ANYONE WHO LIVES A LIFE AND THIS IS ABOUT IT EVERYDAY AND KIND OF AD HOC JUST IDEAS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND THOSE THINGS ARE EVENTUALLY WORTH PUTTING A BOOK.
Stephen: WHY NOT A BROAD STAGE OF MORE ACTION, QUALITY KILLS? (LAUGHTER)
GOOD IDEAS. BUT I THINK THAT -- WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU'RE GOING ALONG AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO HUMAN BEINGS THE WAY WE -- THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE, WE'RE LUCKY PEOPLE. BAD THINGS DON'T NORMALLY HAPPEN TO US BUT WHAT NOVELISTS OR SCREEN WRITERS DO IS THEY THINK WE NEED AN EXPLOSION OF SOME KIND. AND IT'S STUPID, YOU KNOW? THAT'S JUST -- (LAUGHTER) BUT WHAT WE ACTUAL CITY WILL DO IS WE READ THE NEWS AND WHEN WE READ THE NEWS WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF EXPLOSIONS COMING IN ALL THE TIME. WE HAVE ALL THESE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT COME IN INDIRECTLY THROUGH NEWS CHANNELS.
Stephen: I'M IN THE NEWS BUSINESS MYSELF. I'M ONE OF THE PEOPLE BRINGING YOU ALL THOSE TERRIBLE STORIES.
AND I'M ENORMOUSLY GRATEFUL.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU'RE WELCOME.
IT MAKES ME -- IT MAKES ME FEEL -- IT MAKES US FEEL BAD, YOU KNOW, TO --.
Stephen: THE WORLD IS A SCARY PLACE. THE WORLD IS A SCARY PLACE. YEAH, YEAH. (LAUGHTER) THE NICHOLSON, THANK YOU SO MUCH. NICHOLSON BAKER THE BOOK
