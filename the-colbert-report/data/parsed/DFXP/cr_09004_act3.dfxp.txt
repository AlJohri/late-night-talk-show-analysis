WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE  HARVARD MEDICAL PROFESSOR  WHO IS MAPPING THE HUMAN  GENOME. I JUST HOPE HE'S NOT USING  THE IPHONE 5. PLEASE WELCOME DR. GEORGE  CHURCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HEY, DR. CHURCH, THANKS SO  MUCH FOR COMING. YOU ARE PROFESSOR OF  GENETICS AT HARVARD MEDICAL  SCHOOL.
YES.
AND YOU A VISIONARY  BEHIND THE PERSONAL GENOME  PROJECT. WHAT IS THE PERSONAL GENOME  PROJECT. WHY DO WE NEED A PERSONAL  ONE.
THAT IS THE ONLY PROJECT  IN THE WORLD THAT ALLOWED US  TO SHARE OUR GENES, OUR  TRAITS AND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL DATA WITH EVERYBODY IN THE  WORLD.
Stephen: THERE IS ANOTHER  WAY TO DO THAT AND IT  INVOLVES GETTING ON. (LAUGHTER)  OKAY. IT'S EASIER AND-- I'M NOT  SAYING IT MORE FUN BUT IT IS  FUN, YOU SHOULD TRY.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. (LAUGHTER)
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO  ANALYZE IT WITH COMMUTERS  AND A FEW OTHER THINGS.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND. ARE YOU SPLICING THE GENES  OF DIFFERENT ORGANISMS  TOGETHER HERE TO MAKE NEW  MATERIALS, RIGHT, WHAT  IS-- WHAT-- HOW DOES THAT HELP US?
WELL, SO WE CAN NOW MAKE  REPLACE PETROLEUM WITH IN  THE PROCESS FUELS, CHEMICALS,  PLASTICS, ANTI-BUY OIKTS AND SO FORTH. WE CAN START MAKING THOSE  NOW WITH BIOLOGICALLY  ENGINEERED MACHINES.
Stephen: ARE THESE LIKE  BACTERIA, ARE THESE ON A  CELLULAR LEVEL OR YOU CAN DO  THESE WITH LIKE LARGER  ORGANISMS.
BIG VATS, IF IT'S  COLLECTING CARBON DIOXIDE  AND LIGHT IT WOULD BE FLAT  SHEETS, LIKE CROPS, ALMOST, EXCEPT IN CONTAINERS.
Stephen: AND THESE ARE  ALL GENOMICALLY ENGINEERED.
THEY ARE.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU THINK  YOUR WORK WILL EVENTUALLY  DESTROY ALL MANKIND? (LAUGHTER)  DO YOU THINK, LET  ME-- COUPLE OPTION. DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE  LIKE A KILLER VIRUS OR MORE  LIKE A GIANT MUTANT KILLER  SQUIDMAN WHO ARISES FROM THE PAS CIVIC BETWEEN EASTER  ISLAND AND CHILE AND FEASTS  ON OUR FLESH? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, HOPEFULLY-- OUR  BUSINESS IS TO DO SAFETY. WE'RE KIND OF THE ENGINEERS  THAT MAKE THE SEAT BELTS AND  THE AIR BAGS. SO WE ARE ENGINEERS-- .
Stephen: AND THERE ARE NO  CAR ACCIDENTS.
THERE 1.2 MILLION PEOPLE  THAT DIE IN CARS, THAT'S  RIGHT. SO BUT THE POINT IS--   (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: KEEP IT LIGHT,  IT'S LATE NIGHT. YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK ABOUT  THE THINGS THAT YOU, I'M TO  THE GOING TO SAY MAD  SCIENTIST, I'M GOING TO SI HIGHLY INVENTIVE SCIENCE.
THERE WE GO.
Stephen: ARE WORKING ON. CALLED REGION SIS HOW  SYNTHETIC BUY ONLY WILL  REINVENT NATURE AND  OURSELVES. DO WE NEED REINVENTING? WE WERE INVENTED ONCE BY GOD,  THE ALMIGHTY FATHER, MAKER  OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. ARE YOU PLAYING, GOD, SIR,  BECAUSE YOU CERTAINLY HAVE  THE BEARD FOR IT. (APPLAUSE)  JUST DOING MY JOB, RIGHT,  WE'RE ENGINEERS. WE'RE FIXING ALL THESE  THINGS THAT ARE BROKEN.
Stephen: ABOUT ARE WE  BROKEN. WE'RE REINVENTING OURSELVES.
SOME OF US HAVE DISEASE. AND SOME OF THOSE ACTUALLY  CAN BE CHANGED BY CHANGING  OUR, NOT ONLY OUR  ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS ONE  THING WE CAN CHANGE, BUT ALSO OUR GENETICS.
Stephen: YOU CAN BRING  THINGS BACK FROM THE DEAD? AND WERE YOU BEHIND MITT  ROMNEY'S PERFORMANCE LAST  NIGHT? (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE CAN MAKE COPIES OF  THINGS THAT HAVE ELEMENTS OF  ANIMALS OR BACTERIAS, SO  FORTH THAT WERE EXTINCT.
Stephen: OKAY SO, YOU ARE  WORK ON THE WOOLLY MAMMOTH,  RIGHT.
IT'S A POSSIBILITY. FIRST THING THAT IS AMAZING  PROGRESS IN THE FIELD IS  BEING ABLE TO SEQUENCE THE  GENOME OF THE LITTLE BROKEN UP BITS OF DNA THAT ARE  PRESENT IN MAMMOTH REMAINS  AND MANY OTHER ANIMALS IN  MUSEUMS.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER  STORED ANYTHING ON DNA OTHER  THAN ANIMAL INFORMATION.
WE STORED THE-- .
Stephen: HOW IS THIS BOOK  ON DNA?
THERE YOU GO, 20 MILLION  COPIES, DON'T EAT IT,  STEPHEN.
Stephen: WHERE IS IT,  WHERE IS THE-- WHAT DOW  MEAN.
RIGHT THERE IN THAT DOT.
Stephen: HOLD ON. THAT DO THE RIGHT THERE,  WHAT'S IN THERE.
SO WE TOOK THE BOOK  INCLUDING THE PHOTOGRAPHS.
Stephen: YES.
0s AND 1st, CONVERTED TO  ACCs AND Ts.
Stephen: WHICH IS THE  CODE OF DNA.
YUP. AND NOW IT IS THERE, WE MADE  MANY, MANY COPIES OF IT.
Stephen: YOU PUT A LITTLE  DROP.
A LITTLE DROP RIGHT  THERE.
Stephen: OF DNA RIGHT  THERE. THIS PIECE OF PAPER RIGHT  THERE CONTAINS 20 MILLION  COPIES OF THIS BOOK.
THAT'S RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL, DR. GEORGE  CHURCH--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THE BOOK IS  REGION SIS, GO GET IT LIKE  THIS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
