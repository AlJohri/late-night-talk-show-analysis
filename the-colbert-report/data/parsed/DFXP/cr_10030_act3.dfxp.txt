MY GUEST TONIGHT, GOOD NEWS. THE PROSTATE IS PERFECTLY NORMAL. PLEASE WELCOME ED STONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. MR. STONE, DR. STONE, JUST ED?
ED IS FINE.
ALL RIGHT, ED. LISTEN, YOU WERE -- YOU ARE PROFESSOR AT CAL TECH AND YOU WERE FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE NASA JET PROPULSION LABORATORY. NOW, EXPLAIN WHY GPL IS SO IMPORTANT, WHY IS THAT SO IMPORTANT?
GPL IS DESIGNS SPACECRAFT THAT GO TO THE PLANETS AND ALSO DOES EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND ASTROPHYSICS AND WELL.
Stephen: AND YOU ARE THE GUYS CONTROLLING IT ONCE IT GETS ON THE PLANET OR GETS AROUND THE PLANET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND ASTRONAUTS THEY GET ALL THE TICKER TAPE PARADES AND I LOVE THEM AND I WANT TO BE ONE, BUT YOU GUYS ARE THE GUYS WHO ARE HUMPING IT DAY AND NIGHT, YEAR AFTER YEAR TO LEARN THINGS ABOUT OUR SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: DO YOU EVER GET ANGRY AT THOSE GUYS?
NO, WE ARE HAVING TOO MUCH FUN.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU GET INTO DOING THIS?
ACTUALLY, I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN THE, WHEN THE SPACE-AGE BEGAN SO I WAS THERE AT THE BEGINNING AND I HAVE BEEN DOING THESE THINGS NOW FOR OVER 50 YEARS.
Stephen: NOW, WE HAVE A LITTLE, A VIDEO RIGHT HERE, THIS IS THE VOYAGER SPACECRAFT BEING LAUNCHED, WHAT YEAR ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
WE LAUNCHED TWO SPACECRAFT IN 1977 AND THAT WAS A VERY SPECIAL YEAR, ONCE EVERY 176 YEARS YOU CAN LAUNCH A SPACECRAFT THAT CAN FLY BY ALL FOUR OF THE GIANT OUTER PLANETS, JUPITER, SATURN, URANUS AND NEPTUNE, 1977 SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID.
Stephen: THE MOON IS IN THE SEVENTH HOUSE AND MARS IS ALIGNED --
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF AQUARIUS.
YES, YES.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. SO THOSE VOYAGER'S ORIGINAL MISSION?
ITS ORIGINAL MISSION WAS ACTUALLY A MISSION TO SATURN BECAUSE IN THAT TIME SPACECRAFT DIDN'T LAST LONG SO A FOUR-YEAR MISSION, EVERYTHING AFTER THAT WAS SORT OF A BONUS SO AFTER WE FINISHED SATURN WE WENT ON TO URANUS AND AFTER THAT WE WENT TO NEPTUNE AND NOW WE ARE FINALLY REACHED INTERSTELLAR SPACE.
Stephen: SOME OF THE PHOTOS IT WAS ABLE TO BRING BACK, TELL ME WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 1980, 81?
THAT IS 1979 WHEN WE FLEW BY JUPITER AND THE GREAT RED SPOT, ALL OF THE STORMS YOU CAN SEE IN THE JOVIAL ATMOSPHERE.
Stephen: THE FIRST CLOSE-UP SHOT WE EVER GOT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND LET'S CYCLE THROUGH THESE.
AND THEN SATURN, 1980 AND 1981 WITH THE WONDERFUL RING SYSTEM AND LOOKING AT IT ITS SATELLITES AND ONE OF THE MOONS CALLED TITAN WHICH HAS AN ATMOSPHERE LIKE EARTH'S.
Stephen: NOW, JIM, ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY LIKE, A GREAT SHOT OF THE RINGS IS THAT WE WERE THE FIRST ONES, WE WERE THE FIRST ONES ON EARTH, THE FIRST COUNTRY TO DO THIS THING, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
Stephen: WE KIND OF LICKED EVERY PLANET, ALL RIGHT?  IT IS LIKE LICKING THE DOUGHNUTS ON A TRAY, WE OWN THEM NOW, RIGHT?
WE OWN THEM.  THE SOLAR SEASONAL IS KIND OF AMERICA'S ISN'T IT?
YOU GOT IT, THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: SO HOW MANY YEARS NOW HAS IT BEEN UP THERE?
36 YEARS.
Stephen: 36 YEARS?
36 YEARS.
FOUR-YEAR MISSION, 36 YEARS?
YES. WE TOOK IT STEP-BY-STEP. THIS IS HUMANITY'S LONGEST, GREATEST JOURNEY ADVENTURE.
Stephen: NOW SOMETHING SHALL NOT WE RECENTLY FOUND OUT ON AUGUST 20 GET OF 2012 THE DATA HAS BEEN CRUNCHED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND YOU SCFERD SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED ON AUGUST 5TH, 2012.
THE SUN CREATES A HUGE BUBBLE AROUND ITSELF, THE ATMOSPHERE EXPANDS OUTWARD AT A MILLION MILES PER HOUR AND WE FINALLY LEFT THE BUBBLE ON AUGUST 25TH OF LAST YEAR AND NOW THERE IS, WE ARE IN SPACE BETWEEN THE STARS.
Stephen: SO HUMANITY IS IN INTERSTELLAR SPACE NOW.
HUMANITY IS IN INTERSTELLAR SPACE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU KNOW.
BECAUSE WE MEASURED WHAT WAS OUT THERE AND MEASURED IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN WE HAD BEEN SEEING FOR THE FIRTH 30, FOR THE FIRST 35 YEARS.
WHAT IS OUT THERE?  BECAUSE AS FAR AS I KNOW NOTHING IS OUT THERE.
WELL, ALMOST NOTHING. THERE ARE SOME ATOMS, SOME IONS OUT THERE THAT HAVE COME FROM THE EXPLOSION OF OTHER MASSIVE STARS, SUPER NOVAS AND THAT FILLS THE SPACE BETWEEN STARS.
SO NOW WE ARE OUT OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.
YES, WHILE WE ARE OUT OF THE BUBBLE WE STILL AREN'T BEYOND THE COME METS, THE COME METS ARE PART OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AS WELL AND ARE IN INTERSTELLAR SPACE WHERE VOYAGER IS NOW.
Stephen: THE SO THE FACT THAT HUMAN AT THIS IS OUTSIDE OF THE BUBBLE, WE LEFT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, IS THAT SIGNIFICANT?  IT SOUNDS I BELIEVE PRESS RECEIVE. HOW COME THERE AREN'T, AGAIN, PARADES BECAUSE THIS IS SIGNIFICANT LIKE COLUMBUS DISCOVERING AMERICA?  ARE WE GOING TO GET OFF A DAY OFF AND A MATTRESS SALE?
WE SHOULD.
Stephen: WE SHOULD.
WE SHOULD, RIGHT. IT REALLY IS A FIRST STEP FOR OUR HUMAN JOURNEY BEYOND EARTH AND BEYOND THE PLANETS AND INTO STELLAR SPACE AND THESE TWO SPACECRAFT NOW WILL BE IN ORBIT AROUND THE SUN OF OUR GALAXY FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS.
Stephen: REALLY?
YES.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THEY RUNNING ON BY THE WAY.
NATURAL DECAY ZERO, IT IS A VERY LONG LIVED POWER SOURCE AND RUN FOR PROBABLY ABOUT ANOTHER TEN YEARS.
Stephen: SO IT WILL BE DEAD BY 20 --
20-20 FIVE.
Stephen: TO 25 AND AFTER THATS IS A FLYING JUNK HEAP?
IT IS OUR FLYING AMBASSADOR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WHAT IS A SILENT AMBASSADOR.
IT CARRIES A MESSAGE FROM EARTH SAYING THIS IS THE PLACE THAT SENT THIS OBJECT, SO THAT --
Stephen: IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
THAT IS WHAT THAT IS. BEHIND THAT COVER, THAT'S A COVER TO PROTECT THE RECORD THAT IS BEHIND IT. AN OLD-FASHIONED 16 AND TWO-THIRDS DOUBLE SIDED LONG-PLAYING RECORD WHICH IS CARRIES A PICTURE, LIKE AN IMAGE, A STORY OF THE EARTH,.
Stephen: SO WE ARE HOPING THAT THE ALIENS ARE HIPSTERS WHO ENJOY VINYL? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: TO YOU AND TO EVERYONE AT GPL, HUMANITY IS NOW IN INTERSTELLAR SPACE. ED STONE. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. [
