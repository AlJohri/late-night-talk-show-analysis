EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,  TONIGHT I'M IN A GREAT MOOD  BECAUSE I AM FURIOUS. IT HAS BEEN LESS THAN A WEEK  SINCE I-- WELL, WE NABBED  ALLEGED BOSTON BOMBER DZHOKAR  TSARNAEV. AM I PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY?
THE "D" IS SILENT.
THANK YOU D-DJANGO. THE F.B.I. AND THE BOSTON POLICE  DID A HER OAK JOB CATCHING THE  CHECHEN TERRORIST AFTER HE TRIED TO ESCAPE ON A LANDLOCKED BOAT. ( LAUGHTER ). BUT NOW OUR SECRET CHECHEN  PRESIDENT HAS SCREWED THE WHOLE  THING UP.
DZHOKAR TSARNAEV HAS TOLD  F.B.I. AGENTS ABOUT HIS ROLE IN  THE BOMBINGS BUT WAS WE'VE JUST LEARNED HE DID SO BEFORE BEING  ADVISED OF HIS MOOSH RIGHTS.
INVESTIGATORS SAY THE  SURVIVING BOMB SUSPECT HAS NOW  STOPPED TALKING TO THEM AFTER HE WAS READ HIS MIRANDA RIGHTS.
Stephen:  NO! WHY DID WE READ HIM HIS MIRANDA  RIGHTS? IF ANYTHING WE SHOULD HAVE READ  HIM HIS SAMANTHA RIGHTS. YOU GIVE HIM THREE COSMOS, AND,  GIRLFRIEND, HE STARTS TO DISH. NOW, NOW HE KNOWS HE HAS THE  RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT, AND  THINGS WERE GOING SO WELL. RIGHT, "FOX & FRIENDS"?
TURNS OUT THE BOMBING SUSPECT  IN BOSTON WAS SINGING LIKE A  CANARY UNTIL THE JUDGE SHOWED  UP. AND READ HIM HIS RIGHTS.
SO BEFORE HE WAS READ HIS  RIGHTS, HE APPARENTLY WAS  SINGING LIKE A CANARY.
TURNS OUT THE BOSTON BOMBING  SUSPECT WAS SINGING LIKE A  CANARY UNTIL THE JUDGE SHOWED  UP.
TURNS OUT THE BOSTON BOMBING  SUSPECT WAS SINGING LIKE A  CANARY UNTIL THE JUDGE SHOWED  UP.
THEY WERE TALKING TO HIM AND  HE WAS SINGING LIKE A CANARY.
Stephen:  YEAH, HE WAS  SINGING LIKE A CANARY. SWINGING LIKE A PIG. DROPPING A DIME LIKE A DIRTY  ROOT RAT. A STEEL, EVERYTHING WAS JAKE WE  WERE ABOUT TO SEND HIM TO THE  BIG HOUSE, THE SLAERM, ITS GRAY BAR HOTEL. IT WAS ALL-- IT WAS ALL EGGS AND  COVES UNTIL THE CHIEF GOT  HIRCHGY AND GAVE US A DOUBLE-CROSS, THE RUNAROUND, THE  HIGH HOOT. THAT'S WHAT'S EATING ME, SEE? I SHOULD FIX HIS CAGON. THANK YOU, "FOX & FRIENDS," FOR  THE HOT SCOOP. YOU DONE GOOD, AND THE BIG BOSS  IS REAL HAPPY BECAUSE SOMETIMES  YOU GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT A GUY SINGING LIKE A CANARY YOU GOT TO  REPEAT THOSE TALKING POINTS LIKE  A PARAKEET. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
