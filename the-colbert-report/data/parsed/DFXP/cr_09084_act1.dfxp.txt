Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] EAGLE CAW] STOONCHTS WELCOME TO  REPORT. EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. IN HERE OUT THERE ALL AROUND THE  WORLD. [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] THANK  YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA, NATION I  SAY IT ALL THE TIME, AMERICA'S  MILITARY IS THE BADDEST ASS KICKINGEST FIGHTING FORCE IN THE  HISTORY OF FOREVER! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU GET IN OUR WAY AND WE'LL  SPEND 10-15 YEARS TAKING YOU  DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND OUR MILITARY JUST GOT A  WHOLE LOT BAD ASS-ER.
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE  PENTAGON PLANS TO DEPLOY A  WEAPONNIZED LASER ON A SHIP. THIS IS SLATED TO GOOD OFF THE  COAST OF IRAN BY NEXT YEAR. IT SHOWS THE LAIDZER LOCK ON TO  A SLOW MOVING TARGET. IN THIS CASE AN UNMANNED DRONE. THE DRONE SOON CATCHES FIRE AND  CRASHES INTO THE SEA BELOW.
Stephen: IF YOU THINK IT'S  IMPRESSIVE WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE  WHAT THIS LASER DOES TO PLANE PILOTED BY CASTS. [LAUGHTER] THE POINT IS, ENEMIES OF  AMERICA, LASER'S ON ♪ [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WORLD, AMERICA NOW HAS A LASER  THAT CAN DO ANYTHING FROM BURN  THROUGH A FAST ATTACK BOAT TO EMIT A NONLETHAL BURST TO DAZZLE  THE ENEMY. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S THE NAVY'S MOST DAZZLING  TECHNOLOGY SINCE THEY  WEAPONNIZED CHER. ♪ IF I COULD FIND A WAY ♪  NOW I WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW  THAT EVEN THOUGH AMERICA NOW POSSESSES LASER WEAPONS IT DOES  NOT MEAN WE'RE GOING TO TURN  INTO AN EVIL EMPIRE ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY AND OR THAT WE KNOW THE  EWOKS OR THE REBELS AND I FIND  YOUR LACK OF FAITH HIGHLY  LASERRABLE. THE BEST PART IS IT'S SO  AFFORDABLE.
A ROUND OF THIS DIRECTED  ENERGY THAT. S COULD OUT OF THIS LAYER IS A  LL UNDER $1, A LITTLE UNDER $1  U.S. DOLLAR.
Stephen: ONE DOLL YAMPLE  WE'RE LOSING MONEY NOT SETTING  PEOPLE ON FIRE. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE PROUD TO  BE AN AMERICAN WELL. THIS LASER CANNON NOTHING CAN  STOP US EXCEPT BAD WEATHER,  WATER VAPOR, SMOKE, SAND OR  DUST. SO WE'LL DEFEAT ALL OF OUR  ENEMIES AS LONG AS IRAN NEVER  ACQUIRES SAND TECHNOLOGY. [ LAUGHTER ] NATION, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW  YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO MY  OPINIONS I'M A STRAIGHT SHOOTER WHICH IS WHY I NEED A 30-OPINION  CLIP. THISCY SPECIAL GUN EDITION OF  TIP OF THE HAT WAG OF THE  FINGER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FRIENDS, I HAVE LONG WARNED YOU  ABOUT THE THREATS COMING FROM  THE UNITED NATIONS. THE WORLD EASE MOST POWERFUL  COMPLETELY IMPOTENT  ORGANIZATION. THEY CLAIM TO PROTECT CHILDREN'S  RIGHT AND YET THEY HAVE UNDERAGE  WORKERS DOING THEIR  FUND-RAISING. AND THEY MAKE THOSE KIDS TAKE  NIGHT CLUBS AS FIREFIGHTERS. WELL, TONIGHT I'M GIVING A WAG  OF MY FINGER TO THE U.N. FOR  GOING AFTER WHAT WE HOLD MORE PRECIOUS THAN OUR CHILDREN, OUR  GUNS.
THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL  ASSEMBLY HAS OVERWHELMINGLY  PASSED ITS FIRST TREATY REGULATING THE MULTIBILLION  INTERNATIONAL ARMS TRADE. THE U.S. VOTED IN FAVOR.
Stephen: I CANNOT BELIEVE  THE U.S. VOTED FOR THIS THING. THANKFULLY SOME HAVE OPPOSED  THIS MEASURE NAMELY, NORTH  KOREA, IRAN AND SYRIA AND THEY'VE BEEN JOINED BY ONE BRAVE  VOICE.
THE NATIONAL RIFLE  ASSOCIATION HAS LOBBIED AGAINST  THE TREATY.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT THE  NRA HAS OFFICIALLY JOINED WHAT I  CALL THE AXIS OF FREEDOM. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, THE U.N. IS TRYING TO  CONVINCE US THAT GUN CONTROL  WILL MAKE US SAFER. ACCORDING TO U.N. SECRETARY  GENERAL BAN KEY MOON THE TREATY  WILL HELP TO KEEP TERRORISTS AND CRIMINALS AND THEIR LIKE FROM  ACQUIRING DEADLY ARMS. YOU MIGHT THINK, STEPHEN, SOUNDS  LOOK A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE I DON'T  WANT EVIL PEOPLE TO HAVE GUNS. WELL, GREG -- TO MAKE IT EASY  I'VE NAMED YOU ALL GREG. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE GUNS AWAY  FROM ALL EVIL PEOPLE, I SUPPOSE  WOULD YOU START WITH HITLER,  RIGHT? PRETTY BAD GUY. GUESS WHAT? HE SHOT HIM SWFL A GUN. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE AWAY HIS GUN  YOU ARE REALLY SAYING YOU WISH  HITLER WERE STILL ALIVE. THAT'S YOUR POSITION, GREG. THAT'S WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE  U.N. GUN GRABBERS. MEANWHILE BACK IN WASHINGTON THE  SENATE IS OPENING DEBATE  TOMORROW ON A SECOND AMENDMENT CRUSHING GUN CONTROL BILLS THAT  MAY NOT INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON  SEMIAUTOMATICS FOR MAGAZINE CAPACITY BUT DOES INCLUDE  BACKGROUND CHECKS AND A COMPLETE  BAN ON HOLDING YOUR GUN SIDEWAYS BECAUSE YOU SAW IT IN A MOVIE  ONCE.
I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER  TO THE SENATE REPUBLICANS. LAST WEEK KENTUCKY SENATOR AND  HOME BIRTH CAUTIONARY TALE RAND  PAUL PROMISED WOE FILIBUSTER THIS BILL. NOW THE REPUBLICANS HAVE COLD  FEET BECAUSE 85% OF THE GUN  OWNERS FAVOR UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. WELL, OF COURSE OWNERS ARE OKAY  WITH BACKGROUND CHECKS. THEY'VE ALREADY GOT THEIR GUNS. [LAUGHTER] THE SAME REASON I SUPPORT A  MANDATORY HERPES VACCINE. I'VE ALREADY HAD MINE. BESIDES THE ISSUE IS GUN  VIOLENCE. WHY DO WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT  GUNS? NO ONE HAS THE COURAGE TO TALK  ABOUT THE REAL PROBLEMS, AND  WHEN I SAY NO ONE I USUALLY MEAN JOE SCARBOROUGH BECAUSE THIS  MORNING HE HIT THE HEAD ON THE  NAIL. JIM?
WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING  TO PEOPLE MAKING BILLIONS OF  DOLLARS MAKING VIDEO GAMES WHERE YOU SHOOT DOWN, YOU MURDER, YOU  MAUL 1,000 PEOPLE A DAY. BECOMING MORE AND MORE WARPED,  MORE AND MORE TWISTED, MORE AND  MORE DESENSITIZED.
Stephen: WATCHING SOMETHING  OVER AND OVER AGAIN CAN MAKING  YOU FORGET THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FANTASY AND REALITY. FOR INSTANCE, SOMETIMES I  MISTAKE "MORNING JOE" FOR A NEWS  SHOW. JOE IS RIGHT, FOLKS, TODAY IN  AMERICA IT'S LEGAL FOR ANYONE  REGARDLESS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND CRIMINAL HISTORY TO WALTZ INTO A  WAL-MART AND BUY UNLIMITED CALLS  OF DUTY. THE ONLY SAFETY THEY COME WITH  IS AN IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN  PACKAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] I ALWAYS END UP USING MY GUN. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF MY HAT TO  EVERYONE WITH THE COURAGE TO  FACE THE REAL PROBLEMS, FAKE  GUNS. IT'S AN ESPECIALLY BRAVE  ARGUMENT CONSIDERING RESEARCH  HAS FOUND NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT MING VIDEO GAMES RESULTS IN  REAL LIFE VIOLENCE. OH, YEAH, THEN HOW DO YOU  EXPLAIN ME THROWING MY Wii  REMOTE THROUGH MY TELEVISION. DON'T SAY IT WAS MY SWEATY PALM  BECAUSE I ALWAYS TALC UP BEFORE  Wii BOWLING, EVERYWHERE. I'M LIKE A TURNISH DELIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] OF -- TURKISH DELIGHT. [LAUGHTER] JOE AND I ARE NOT ALONE IN  BLAMING THE VIDEO GAMES SOX ARE  DEMOCRATS LIKE CALIFORNIA SENATOR AND MARGARET THATCH TER  HAIR LOOK ALIKE DINAN FEINSTEIN.
HOW COME YOU ARE NOT LOOKING  AT THE VIDEO GAMES THAT MY  CHILDREN SEE AND LEAD TO  VIOLENCE.
Stephen: THEY ARE TO BLAME  FOR MASS SHOOTINGS. I'M SURE YOU'LL SAY WHAT ABOUT  THE MASS SHOOTINGS THAT TOOK  PLACE BEFORE VIDEO GAMES? SHUT UP, GREG. CHARLES JOSEPH WHITMAN SHOT 16  PEOPLE FROM A CLOCK TOWER AFTER  PLAYING SCRABBLE. AND IN 1915 A MAN SHOT 7 PEOPLE  DEAD BECAUSE HIS PARENTS TURNED  A BLIND TO HIS ON SESSION WITH HOOP AND STICK. HOOP AND STICK, I SAY. CLEARLY WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE  GAMES BUT NOT REMOVE ANY OF THE  WEAPONS FROM THEM. BECAUSE THAT MIGHT DESENSITIZE  THESE FRAGILE YOUNG MINDS TO THE  POSSIBILITY OF GUN DPLOAL THE -- CONTROL IN THE REAL WORLD. THAT APPEARS TO BE A FANT SIX  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
