Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUESTS TONIGHT HAVE A NEW ALBUM OF DUETS CALLED "CHEEK TO CHEEK.." I'LL ASK WHOSE CHEEK GOT TOP BILLING. PLEASE WELCOME TONY BENNETT AND LADY GAGA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
LADY, GOOD TO SEE YOU. TONY, ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE
Stephen: WHAT A DELIGHT AND HONOR AND SURPRISE. I'M HONORED TO HAVE YOU HERE, I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU BOTH TONY, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE WE WERE BOTH SINGING IN FRONT OF 250,000 PEOPLE IN A MALL IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WE PARED IT DOWN TONIGHT TO THE CORE GROUP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GAGA THANKS FOR COMING ON  FOR THE FIRST TIME TO THE SHOW.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: YOU TWO ARE A LITTLE BIT OF AN UNUSUAL PAIR.
REALLY?
Stephen: DON'T EXPECT IT NECESSARILY. TONY, YOU'RE KNOWN FOR LEAVING YOUR HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO. GAGA, ONE MIGHT EXPECT YOU THE FIND IT AND TURN INTO A HAT.  HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT?
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I COULD GET A HEART TO DO THAT?
Stephen: WHEN THE CAMERAS ARE OFF I KNOW A GUY. SO HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT? HOW DID YOU GUYS GET TOGETHER?
YOU TELL HIM, TONY. WHAT HAPPENED WITH ME, WE DID A BENEFIT FOR THE POOR PEOPLE OF MANHATTAN. REMEMBER THAT?
YES, THE ROBIN HOOD BENEFIT
Stephen: THERE ARE POOR PEOPLE IN MANHATTAN? (LAUGHTER)
YES TOO MANY. QUITE A FEW.
Stephen: WOW. I THOUGHT THEY MOVED TO QUEENS. SORRY. (LAUGHTER)
WHEN I SAW HER PERFORM, I SAID, I NEVER HEARD ANYBODY THAT THE PUBLIC LOVED MORE THAN LADY GAGA, THE FIRST TIME I HEARD HER
THANK YOU, TONY.
Stephen: SOME PEOPLE FROM YOUR AGE BRACKET, SHALL WE SAY, MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE PAST SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS CHOICES GAGA HAS MADE. WHAT DID YOU HEAR WHEN YOU HEARD HER SING? DID SHE REMIND YOU OF ANYBODY YOU HAD SUNG WITH BEFORE? BECAUSE YOU'VE SUNG WITH THEM ALL
SHE'S THE MOST CONSUMMATE PERFORMER I'VE EVER MET.f AND I'VE MET A LOT OF PERFORMERS IN MY LIFETIME
Stephen: DID YOU GROW UP AS A FAN OF TONY BENNETT?
OF COURSE. I'M A NEW YORK BABY. TONY'S AN ITALIAN AMERICAN NEW YORKER, SO I GREW UP LOVING TONY SO MUCH. MY FATHER USED TO PLAY TONY ALL THE TIME. WE WOULD MAKE, YOU KNOW, MEAT BALLS AND SPAGHETTI IN THE KITCHEN AND HE WOULD BE SINGING TO US. AND GOSH, I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD SITTING NEXT TO YOU TODAY ON THE NEWS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YES, ON THE NEWS,  THANK YOU. NOW THE ALBUM IS CALLED TONY BENNETT AND LADY GAGA "CHEEK TO CHEEK." AGAIN, I HAVE TO SAY, WITH YOUR REPUTATION, LADY GAGA, I WASN'T SURE IF THESE WERE THE TWO CHEEKS WE WERE GOING TO SEE ON THE COVER. YOU COULD HAVE SOLD MAYBE EVEN MORE ALBUMS THAN THIS. IT'S SONGS FROM THE GREAT AMERICAN SONG BOOK. WHAT MAKES SOMETHING A GREAT AMERICAN SONG? OTHER THAN, SAY, THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AND GOD BLESS AMERICA?
INTELLIGENT COMPOSERS
Stephen: INTELLIGENT COMPOSERS
AND QUALITY MUSIC. AND IT'S ACTUALLY AN ACTUAL BOOK. IT'S A BOOK OF SONGS THAT WERE COMPILED OVER ABOUT TWO TO THREE DECADES, AND THEY WERE SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT THAT THEY HAD ON MUSIC AND, YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT FRED ASTAIRE AND HOW HE WAS REALLY THE FIRST PERSON TO SING ALL THE SONGS THAT WERE INTRODUCED TO THE GREAT AMERICAN SONG BOOK. TONY CALLS IT THE FRED ASTAIRE SONG BOOK
RIGHT, IT'S TRUE. ALL OF THE COMPOSERS WERE HANDPICKED BY THE MOST INCREDIBLE PERFORMERS ON THE PLANET AND COMPILED INTO THIS BOOK AND WE CHOSE ALL THE SONGS FROM IT THAT WE REALLY LOVED.
NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS EVER GIVEN THE REST OF THE WORLD THE BEST POPULAR SONGS. WE PLAY IN CHINA, RUSSIA, ISRAEL, WE PLAY EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD KNOWS THESE AMERICAN SONGS.
WE JUST SANG IN TEL AVIV TOGETHER. 27,000 PEOPLE SINGING A SONG THAT'S AT LEAST 70 YEARS OLD. IT WAS INCREDIBLE TO WITNESS AND IT WAS INSPIRING. I LOVE SINGING WITH HIM.
Stephen: WELL, WOULD YOU GUYS INSPIRE US RIGHT NOW WITH A SONG?
DIDN'T WE JUST SING? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: NO! NO, LADY GAGA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, LADY GAGA. YOU HAVEN'T SUNG YET. THIS IS THE INTERVIEW  THAT'S HAPPENING BEFORE YOU SING. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY TONY BENNETT AND LADY GAGA! COME ON!
