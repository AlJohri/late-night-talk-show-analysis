Stephen: WELCOME BARK  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT SAY PULITZER  PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR WHOSE NEW  BOOK IS CALLED WHY PREACH. ANSWER:  CAUSE GOD. PLEASE WELCOME GARRY WILLS. BOOM. BOOM. MRS. WILLS -- MR. WILLS, THANK  YOU FOR JOINING AMERICA IT'S ALL  CATHOLIC ALL THE TIME TONIGHT.
YES.
Stephen: YOU ARE A  PULITZER-PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR OF  MANY BOOKS INCLUDING "WHY I AM A CATHOLIC" "PAIPEL SINS" AND  "LINCOLN AT GETTYSBURG."  YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED "WHY PREACH:  A FAILED TRADITION."  WHAT DO YOU MEAN FAILED SNL IT'S  BEEN OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS. WHAT IS FAILED ABOUT THAT?
WELL, THEY CONTINUE TO  PRETEND TO TURN BREAD AND WINE  INTO THE BODY AND BLOOD OF JESUS WHICH DOESN'T HAPPEN.
Stephen: YOU HOLD IT RIGHT  THERE, BUDDY? ARE YOU A CATHOLIC?
YES.
Stephen: YOU DON'T BELIEVE  IN IT?
WAS AUGUSTINE A CATHOLIC.
Stephen: EARLY CATHOLIC  HADN'T DEVELOPED YET. THIRD CENTURY.
HE SAID IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT  WE EAT GOD, DIGEST GOD AND  EXCREATE GOD. SAID THE BODY OF CHRIST IS US,  THE FOLLOWERS OF JESUS.
Stephen: OF COURSE, YOU ARE  WHAT YOU EAT. IF WE TAKE THE EUCHARIST WE  BECOME THE BODY OF CHRIST.
WE DON'T CONSUME HIM, HE  CONSUMES US.
Stephen: HE SAID THIS IS MY  BODY THIS, IS MY BLOOD.
THERE HE WAS IN HIS BODY. HE SAID EAT THIS BRED, IT'S MY  BODY. HE DIDN'T SAY TAKE A CHUNK OUT  OF MY ARM OR TAP MY BLOOD. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: IF JESUS IS IN  HEAVEN AND ON EARTH HOW CAN THEY  BE IN TWO PLACE AS THE ONCE.
IT'S THE TRIN JIT A MYSTERY.
Stephen: THE EUCHARIST IS  ALSO A MYSTERY.
NO, IT'S A FAKE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: LET'S GET BACK TO  PRIESTS.
YES.
Stephen: SURELY YOU HAD  SOME GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH  PRIESTS.
MANY.
Stephen: ARE YOU CALLING  THEM FOOL?
THEY ARE BROTHERS IN CHRIST  AS LONG AS THEY DON'T PRETEND TO  DO THE IMPOSSIBLE THEY DO WONDERFUL THINGS.
Stephen: CHRIST ROSE FROM  THE DEAD.
YES.
Stephen: HOW CAN YOU ACCEPT  THAT AND NOT ACCEPT THAT GOD CAN  WORK THROUGH THE PRIEST TOP TRANSSUB STAN SHIITE.
NOTHING IN THE BIBLE --
Stephen: UPON THIS ROCK I  BUILD MY CHURCH AND THE GATES OF  HELL SHOULD NOT PREVAIL AGAINST  IT.
THAT DIDN'T SAY HE WAS A  PRIEST. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: NO BUT ST. PAUL  SAYS THOU ARE A PRIEST  FOREVER --
THAT WAS NOT ST. PAUL.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT PAUL?
NOBODY KNOWS WHO WROTE IT. IT'S A MYSTERIOUS ANONYMOUS  DOCUMENT.
Stephen: ISN'T IT IN THE  BIBLE?
YES.
Stephen: THEN GOD WROTE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU ARE RIGHT IT'S FROM THAT  EPIVOTEL OF -- EPISTLE OF  HEBREWS. SINCE JESUS COULDN'T BECOME A  PRIEST IN JEWISH LAW THEY SAID,  WELL, THERE WAS A PRIEST OF HIGH GOD AND ABRAHAM OFFERED HIM A  TITHE AND SO JESUS WILL BE IN  THE LINE OF HIM AND HE WASN'T EVEN A JEW. IT'S A CRAZY LETTER.
Stephen: ARE YOU A JEW?
NO STEERNTLE NEITHER AM I SO  THAT WORKS FOR ME. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN YOU DIE, NOT SOON I HOPE,  WHEN YOU DIE ARE YOU GOING TO  WANT A PRIEST THERE TO GIVE YOU LAST RITES?
NO.
Stephen: WHY?
BECAUSE IT'S AN INVENTED  SACRAMENT THAT HAD NO FOUNDATION  IN THE EARLY CHURCH. THE PRAYER OF THE BODY OF CHRIST  IS A PRAYER OF ALL MY FELLOW  CHRISTIANS. I'D LIKE A PRIVATE OR ANY OTHER  CHRISTIAN TO BE THERE PRAYING  WITH ME. HE'S A BROTHER IN CHRIST BUT  HE'S NOT THE ONLY CONDUIT OF  GOD'S GRACE.
Stephen: PRIEST HAVE  DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO THIS?
WELL, THEY SAY SO.
Stephen: WOULD YOU RATHER  NO PRIESTS AT ALL.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT POPE?
AREN'T THEY A PRIEST?
Stephen: A SUPERPRIEST. WOULD YOU LIKE IT TO GO BENEDICT  THE 16th TO NOBODY THE FIRST.
VERY GOOD IDEA.
Stephen: IS THERE ANY VALUE  TO THE PROOFTHOOD YOU THINK WE  WOULD BE LOSING IF WE GOT RID OF ALL PRIESTS?
LEADERSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY,  PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC IS  ALWAYS GOOD. THE PRIESTS CAN DO THAT. THAT'S FINE. TEACH THE BIBLE. YOU TEACH THE BIBLE.
Stephen: YEAH, ON THIS  SHOW. [LAUGHTER] WHERE DO YOU GO AFTER THIS? THE BARNES AND NOBLE IN HELL? [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I PRAY NOT.
Stephen: YOU PRAY NOT, SO  DO I. GARRY WILLS, EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE BOOK IS "WHY PRIESTS" WE'LL  BE
