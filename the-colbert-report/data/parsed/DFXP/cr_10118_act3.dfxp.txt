[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A VIETNAM VET AND A FORMER SENATOR.  I'LL ASK HIM WHICH IS THE BIGGER QUAGMIRE. PLEASE WELCOME JAMES WEBB. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SENATOR, SENATOR, SECRETARY, YOUR EXCELLENCY, WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT MORE, BY THE WAY, DO YOU WANT SECRETARY, SENATOR? WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT?
JIM.
Stephen: THAT'S A NICE TITLE. IS THAT SHORT FOR SOMETHING? NOW, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK. THIS IS TWO, THREE, FOUR, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE SHOW. I ALWAYS LIKE  HAVING YOU ON BECAUSE YOU'RE A REAL REAGAN MAN. YOU WERE REAGAN'S SECRETARY OF THE NAVY, CORRECT?
RIGHT.
DID YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND? >>WELL I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN A REAGAN MAN. BUT I DID ADMIRE HIM A LOT.
Stephen: WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN A REAGAN MAN?  WERE YOU THERE WHEN HE PUNCHED THE BERLIN WALL DOWN?
NO. I THINK HE DID THAT WITHOUT MY HELP.
OK GOOD.  A FORMER SENATOR IN VIRGINIA. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY UNDER REAGAN. YOU'VE WRITTEN TEN BOOKS. MOST RECENTLY YOU HAVE A NEW MEMOIR CALLED "I HEARD MY COUNTRY CALLING." WHEN YOUR COUNTRY CALLED, WHAT DID YOUR COUNTRY SAY TO YOU? AND DID YOU PICK UP FIRST TIME OR DID YOU PUSH "DECLINE."
ACTUALLY AT THIS POINT WE HAVE TO WORRY A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE MAKE OUR CALLS AND OUR COUNTRY IS LISTENING, THE N.S.A.
Stephen: BECAUSE THAT KEEPS US SAFE YOU MEAN.
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.
Stephen: ARE YOU A TERRORIST?
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.
Stephen: NOT THAT YOU KNOW OF.
NOT THAT I KNOW OF BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT N.S.A. COMES UP WITH WHEN THEY RELEASE THESE DOCUMENTS.
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. THEY KNOW EVERYTHING ANYWAY.
Stephen: OKAY. WELL IT'S BEEN LOVELY TO HAVE YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE. OK, YOU LIVED A LIFE OF SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY. WHICH SERVICE YOU'VE GIVEN TO THE COUNTRY, WHETHER IN GOVERNMENT OR IN THE MILITARY, HAS BEEN MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU?
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I THINK I'VE EVER BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR OUR COUNTRY IS SERVE AS A MARINE IN VIETNAM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THERE'S NO... THERE NO GREATER HONOR THAN TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE ENTRUSTED WITH THE LIVES OF AMERICANS WHEN THEY'RE AT RISK. AND I'M VERY PROUD OF MY SON FOR HAVING SERVED AS A MARINE IN IRAQ TOO, BY THE WAY. [APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE ON A COUPLE TIMES BEFORE RUNNING FOR SENATE AND AS A SENATOR, YOU WORE YOUR SON'S COMBAT BOOTS WHILE HE WAS OVER THERE. DID HE GET BACK SAFE?
HE DID.
Stephen: GOOD TO HEAR IT. GOOD TO HEAR IT.
ALSO I'M REALLY PROUD FROM THE TIME I ENTERED THE SENATE, WE INTRODUCED THE POST-9/11 G.I. BILL, WHICH IS THE BEST G.I. BILL OUR VETERANS HAVE EVER HAD IN OUR HISTORY. AND THAT WAS GREAT MOMENT IN '08. I WOULD THINK I WAS ON YOUR SHOW SHORTLY THEREAFTER. SINCE THAT TIME MORE THAN A MILLION VETERANS FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET A BETTER EDUCATION AND IMPROVE THEIR LIVES. [APPLAUSE]
Stephen: NOW, YOU WERE ABLE TO DO THAT. NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE GET THINGS DONE IN CONGRESS RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU WERE ABLE TO GET THAT G.I. BILL THROUGH WITHOUT, YOU SAY, CUTTING A LOT OF POLITICAL DEALS TO GET IT DONE.
WE DIDN'T CUT DEALS, BUT IT WAS NOT AN EASY LIFT. LOOKING BACK ON IT, IT SEEMS LIKE A NO-BRAINER TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THESE PEOPLE WHO SERVED, THEIR TUITION, BUY THEIR BOOKS, GIVE THEM A STIPEND LIKE WE DID FOR THE WORLD WAR II VETERANS, BUT WE WERE OPPOSED ALL THE WAY TO THE VERY END BY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
Stephen: WHY WOULD YOU, IF YOU WERE IN THE SENATE, NOT AN EASY CLUB TO GET INTO, AND YOU WERE ABLE TO GET THINGS DONE YOU BELIEVE IN, WHICH ISN'T EASY TO GET DONE, WHY WOULD YOU NO LONGER WANT TO BE ONE OF THE 100 MOST POWERFUL MEN OF THE UNITED STATES?
I THINK IT'S HEALTHY TO TAKE A STEP AWAY. I'VE DONE IT FOUR TIMES IN MY LIFE. I'VE SERVED FOR A WHILE. THEN I LEAVE AND GO WRITE AND DO JOURNALISM AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND THEN COME BACK IN.
Stephen: ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT STEPPING BACK IN BECAUSE THERE IS SPECULATION YOU WILL BE THE FIRST DEMOCRAT TO ANNOUNCE HIS CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT SPECULATION IS COMING FROM, BUT I'M GLAD...
RIGHT HERE. YOU SAID YOU WOULD NOT MAKE A VERY GOOD VICE PRESIDENT. YOU SAID YOU WOULD NOT MAKE A VERY GOOD VICE PRESIDENT, AND ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU TOP OUT AT SENATOR OR THAT YOU'LL ONLY TAKE PRESIDENT? THERE'S NOTHING IN BETWEEN.
IF I WAS GOING TO BE ANNOUNCING FOR THE PRESIDENCY TONIGHT, I WOULD AT LEAST HAVE WORN A TIE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
Stephen: I'LL WAIT.
I WOULD LIKE YOUR PAC LIST BY THE WAY.
Stephen: IF I GAVE YOU MY SUPER PAC LIST, THAT WOULD BE A FEDERAL OFFENSE, FOR WHICH NEITHER OF US WOULD BE PUNISHED IN ANY WAY. SENATOR WEBB THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. SENATOR JAMES WEBB, "I HEARD MY COUNTRY CALLING." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU, SENATOR.
