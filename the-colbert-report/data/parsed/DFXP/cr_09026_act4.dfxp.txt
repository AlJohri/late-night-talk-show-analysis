Stephen:  OH, HI THERE. I WAS JUST WAITING FOR THE  CAMERA TO COME BACK ON AND GIVE  MY LIFE MEANING. LAST MONTH, WE CELEBRATED THE  SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  COLBERT REPORT. I DIDN'T MENTION IT AT THE TIME,  BECAUSE AMERICA WAS  THOUGHTLESSLY HING ITS  PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN DURING MY SPECIAL DAY. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING  ABOUT THE LAST SEVEN YEARS--  1,118 SHOWS-- AND ASKING, WHAT WERE OUR TRIUMPHS? WHAT WERE OUR FAILURES? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I SLEPT?   ( LAUGHTER )   OF COURSE, TRADITIONALLY THE  SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY GIFT IS  WOOL, SEE I WAS GOING TO GET YOU  SHEEP. THEN I THOUGHT, NO, THAT'S  STUPID.  I'VE GOT A BETTER PRESENT. I PRESENT THE COLBERT REPORT  7th ANNIVERSARY PORTRAIT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). IT'S LIKE THE PICTURE OF  "DORRIAN GRAY" ONLY THIS THIS  CASE, WHILE THE PAINTING REMAINS YOUNG AND VIBRANT.
WITHER TO A FORM OF MYSELF. WE HAVE AN EXTRA PEABODY ON THE  PANT EXPEL I'M HOLDING MY NEW  BOOK, "AMERICA AGAIN, REBOTTOM BECOMING THE GREATNESS WE NEVER  WEREN'T."  THIS PAINTING, THIS ENTIRE SHOW  WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOU, THE COLBERT NATION. IN MANY WASES THIS ISN'T JUST A  PORTRAIT OF ME. IT'S A PORTRAIT OF YOU IN THE  FORM OF ME.   (  LAUGHTER  )   AND I HAVE TO SAY, YOU LOOK  GREAT.   ( LAUGHTER )   THANKS FOR SEVEN YEARS. I, FOR ONE, CANNOT WAIT TO SEE  WHAT NUMBER COMES NEXT. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY, AND HAPPY  THANKSGIVING!
