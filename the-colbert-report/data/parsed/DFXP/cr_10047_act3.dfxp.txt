Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A CONTRIBUTING EDITOR FOR "NEW YORK" MAGAZINE, HIS NEW BOOK IS YOU CALLED "THE LOUDEST VOICE IN THE ROOM." EITHER THE BOOK IS ABOUT ME OR I WASN'T IN THE ROOM. PLEASE WELCOME GABRIEL SHERMAN. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO WEAR A TIE. KEEPING IT CASUAL. OKAY, YOU'RE A CONTRIBUTING EDITOR TO "NEW YORK" MAGAZINE AND YOUR WORK HAS ALSO APPEARED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES AND GQ, OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE ESTABLISHED YOUR CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALS. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR FAIR AND BALANCED BOOK ABOUT ROGER AILES, THE FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF FOX NEWS.
OKAY. I HAVE SOURCES AT FOX NEWS, OKAY. I GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS OVER THERE. ONE OF MY SOURCES WAS TALKING TO ME TODAY AND THIS PERSON SAYS YOU'RE NOT A GOOD GUY. DEFEND YOURSELF, ARE YOU A GOOD GUY?
WERE THEY ON THE RECORD.
Stephen: NO.
THEY WERE FOR ME, NOT FOR YOU.
I'M A GOOD GUY.
Stephen: YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.
I'M A REPORTER. I COVERED MEDIA AND AILES IS THE BIGGEST STORY IN MEDIA, HE HAS CREATED A POWERHOUSE, IT HAS TWICE THE RATINGS THAT CNN AND MSNBC DOES, AILES' CHANNEL GENERATES A BILLION DOLLARS OF PROFIT.
Stephen: THAT IS A LOT OF LUBRICATED CATHETER ADS. SO IF YOU COVER MEDIA THIS IS THE BIGGEST STORY, HE HAS CREATED A PHENOMENON IN AMERICAN CULTURE.
Stephen: BUT THIS IS A HIT JOB. THIS IS WHAT MY SOURCES TELL ME THIS IS A HIT JOB, OKAY, IS IT A HIT JOB?
IT'S NOT A HIT JOB.
Stephen: OK THEN SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE, PROVE YOU'RE BONAFIDES, AND THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST DOING A HATCHET JOB ON ROGER AILES, SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE AND NICE ABOUT ROGER AILES THAT IS IN THE BOOK.
WELL, FOX NEWS IS A FAMILY. THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR AILES LOVE HIM. I MEAN HE IS A CHARISMATIC LEADER. WHEN HE WENT TO WORK FROM NBC TO FOX NEWS IN 1996, MORE THAN 80 PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIM OUT THE DOOR. THEY WERE RUSHING TO GO WORK FOR THE GUY. AILES CALLED AN EXECUTIVE AT NBC AND SAID IT IS A JAILBREAK. THESE GUYS COULDN'T LEAVE FAST ENOUGH TO GO WORK FOR HIM. SO HE IS A CHARISMATIC LEADER.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU FOR COMING BY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT'S ALL WE HAVE-- EVIDENTLY WE HAVE MORE TIME, EVIDENTLY WE HAVE MORE TIME. OKAY YOU SAY HE'S A  CHARISMATIC LEADER. BUT YOU ALSO SAY HE'S A BULLY. THAT HE'S VINDICTIVE. IF HE IS A BULLY AND VINDICTIVE WHY DO PEOPLE LOVE HIM? BECAUSE THEY LOVE HIM.
THEY LOVE AND THEY FEAR HIM. YOU KNOW, ONE EXECUTIVE TOLD ME IN A MEETING-- .
Stephen: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE.
WELL, ONE IN THE SAME, LOVE, HATE.
Stephen: OKAY.
ONE EXECUTIVE TOLD ME IN A MEETING THAT THE TOP GUYS HOPE THAT THE T-REX WON'T SEE THEM. THEY HOPE HE DOESN'T CALL ON THEM IN A MEETING BECAUSE HE IS SO VOLATILE THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SINGLED OUT IN FRONT OF HIM. AND SO THAT HE IS CHARISMATIC, LARGER-THAN-LIFE, CITIZEN KANE LIKE FIGURE WHICH IS GREAT TO WORK FOR BUT IT IS ALSO TERRIFYING.
Stephen: HOW MUCH TIME DID YOU SPEND INTERVIEWING ROGER AILES, WAS HE A GOOD GUY, DID YOU LIKE SPENDING ALL THAT TIME WITH HIM.
HE DID NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS BOOK.
Stephen: THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE? YOU DON'T KNOW. THIS IS ALL JUST CONJECTURE AND HEARSAY. YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT MY FRIEND ROGER.
I WENT OUT AND SPENT THREE YEARS INTERVIEWING MORE THAN 600 PEOPLE TO GET A NUANCED AND FULL PORTRAIT.
Stephen: BUT WHY DID YOU DO THAT, DIDN'T YOU LEARN ANYTHING FROM FOX NEWS, YOU DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT THE STORY TO BE AND JUST ONLY TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO  SUPPORT IT. (APPLAUSE)
I WISH JOURNALISM WAS THAT EASY.
Stephen: NO, NOT JOURNALISM, JUST TALKING ABOUT BOOKS. NOW HE IS FAMOUSLY, THE RUMOR IS THAT ROGER, I DON'T THINK THIS IS FAIR BUT THE RUMOR IS THAT ROGER IS KIND OF A VINDICTIVE GUY. YOU CROSS HIM AND IT'S GO TIME, ALL RIGHT. HE WILL DESTROY YOU. ARE YOU AFRAID? ARE YOU AFRAID THAT HE IS GOING TO MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL? AND AM I AFRAID THAT YOU HAVE DRAGGED ME INTO YOUR DEATH SPIRAL BY BEING ON THE SHOW? ARE YOU AFRAID?  ARE WE BEING ATTACKED?
NO I'M NOT AFRAID. I HAVE BEEN ATTACKED >>OKAY RELENTLESSLY ON THE INTERNET BUT DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF IT.
Stephen: WHY? WHY, DOESN'T THE INTERNET HAVE AS MUCH CREDIBILITY AS YOUR BOOK DOES? YOU HAVE ATTACKED ROGER, HEY, HEY, I HOPE YOU ARE BOOING THE INTERNET OR HIM.
I HAD A TEAM OF TWO FACT CHECKERS SPEND MORE THAN 2,000 HOURS VETTING THIS BOOK BEFORE PUBLICATION. LAST TIME I CHECKED I DON'T THINK A LOT OF THE RIGHT WING WEB SITES HAVE FACT CHECKERS.
Stephen: WELL, THEY DON'T NEED TO. THEY DON'T NEED TO. SIR, LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CHECK YOUR FACTS IF YOU START WITH THE TRUTH. IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE, RIGHT HERE.
Stephen: JESUS SAID THAT.
THEN IT'S GOSPEL.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT ROGER AILES ACTUALLY BELIEVES THE THINGS THAT FOX NEWS IS PROMOTING OR DO YOU THINK HE MOSTLY BELIEVES IN CREATING REALLY GOOD TELEVISION SHOWS FOR PEOPLE TO WATCH?
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS THE BIG REVEAL FOR MY BOOK AFTER THREE YEARS OF REPORTING, EVERYTHING IS REAL. EVERYTHING THAT YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN STARTS WITH HIM. THERE IS A MORNING MEETING, 8 A.M. IN THE MORNING, HE GATHERS HIS TOP GUYS, HE MONOLOGUES ABOUT THE NEWS. YOU KNOW, THEY JOKE INSIDE FOX THAT THE BEST SHOW ON FOX NEWS IS AILES'S MORNING EDITORIAL MEETING AT 8AM. HE  WILL SAY THINGS LIKE OBAMA HATES CAPITALISM, OBAMA IS DESTROYING AMERICA. NO ONE'S DIED FROM NUCLEAR POWER BUT 15 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHOPPED UP BY THOSE DAMN WINDMILLS.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, SO-- SO AT 8 A.M. AILES SORT OF SETS THE AGENDA FOR WHAT PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT FOR THE DAY.
YEAH.
Stephen: BUT FOX AND FRIENDS STARTS AT 6 A.M. IS THAT WHY FOR THE FIRST TWO HOURS THEY SEEM SO CONFUSED? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GABRIEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE BOOK IS "THE LOUDEST VOICE IN THE ROOM." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
