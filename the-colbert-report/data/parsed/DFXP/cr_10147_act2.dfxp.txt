Stephen: WELCOME BACK. NATION, THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU IT'S NO SURPRISE WE ALL KNOW, WE ALL KNOW THAT AIR TRAVEL IS TERRIBLE. FLIGHTS ARE ALWAYS LATE, THEY CUT THE SEX SCENES FROM THE MOVIES. AND THE SEAT BELTS ARE NOWHERE NEAR LONG ENOUGH TO HANG YOURSELF. (LAUGHTER) AND THINGS ARE ONLY GETTING WORSE.
AS PLANES HAVE BECOME MORE PACKED, FLIGHT ATTENDANTS SAY THEY HAVE NOTICED AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS INVOLVING UNRULY PASSENGERS. A WOMAN KNITTING DECIDED TO RECLINE HER SEAT. A WOMAN BEHIND HER WAS TRYING TO SLEEP AND SHE HAD HER HEAD ON A TRAY TABLE. ACCORDING TO PASSENGERS SHE STARTED SCREAMING AND SWEARING.
LAST NIGHT ON THE AMERICAN AIRLINES JET FROM MIAMI TO PARIS, A MAN FOUGHT WITH A PASSENGER SEATED IN FRONT OF HIM, HE SAYS BECAUSE HIS LEGS HURT FROM DIABETES. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT TRIED TO CALM THE MAN WHO REPORTEDLY BECAME MORE IRATE AND GRABBED ATTENDANT BY THE ARM THAT IS WHEN AIR MARSHALS BROKE THEIR COVER.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, ARMED MARSHALS ARE NOW POISED TO SUBDUE THE DISGRUNTLED. MAKING THE FOUR SEATING CLASSES NOW FIRST, BUSINESS, ECONOMY AND THE HUNGER GAMES. (LAUGHTER) AND IN THE BATTLE FOR LEG ROOM, THE WEAPONS ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE SOPHISTICATED.
THE TWO PASSENGERS IN MIDDLE SEATS IN ECONOMY PLUS, THOSE ARE THE SEATS YOU PAY EXTRA FOR A BIT MORE LEG ROOM. THE MAN IN 12 B USING WHAT IS CALLED A KNEE DEFENDER ON THE SEAT BACK IN FRONT OF HIM. THOSE BRACKETS PLACED ON THE TRAY TABLE KEEP THE SEAT IN FRONT FROM RECLINING. THAT MEANT THE WOMAN IN 11 B COULD NOT LEAN BACK AND SHE WAS NOT HAPPY. AN ARGUMENT OVER PERSONAL SPACE UNTIL SHE REPORTEDLY TOOK A CUP OF WATER, THROWING IT INTO THE FACE OF THE MAN BEHIND HER.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE DIDN'T JUST CHANGE SEATS. THEY WERE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE ON THE PLANE. (LAUGHTER) NATION, THIS IS A TREND. THIS IS A TREND ACROSS ALL MAJOR AIRLINES. AS AIRLINE WEEKLY PUT IT, QUOTE, DENSIFICATION IS A MAJOR TREND IN THE INDUSTRY NOW. AND WHEN THERE'S MAJOR DENSIFICATION YOU CAN EXPECT A LITTLE PUNCHIFICATION. SOME SHOUTENING AND EVENTUALLY SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET STABULATED. BUT LET ME ASSURE NEW IS HAPPENING FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE REASONS, FLYERS IN THE BACK OF THE PLANE ARE GETTING SQUEEZED TO GIVE PASSENGERS IN FIRST AND BUSINESS CLASS MORE ROOM. NOW IT MIGHT SEEM UNFAIR, BUT THIS IS THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AS EXPLAINED BY THIS REPRESENTATIVE FROM UNITED AIRLINES.
I BELONG TO THE FRONT. YOU BELONG TO THE TAIL. KEEP YOUR PLACE.
Stephen: AND NO, YOU MAY NOT HAVE A WHOLE CAN OF APPLE JUICE. I SAY THAT AIRLINES HAVE TO DO MORE TO TURN COACH CONFLICTS INTO ENTERTAINMENT FOR US WEALTHY FLYERS. WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING A LIVE FEED OF THESE AISLE FIGHTS FOR OUR PERSONAL PLASMA SCREENS? FORGET THAT DINKY KNEE DEFENDER, LET'S STRAP SOME RAZORS ON THOSE ELBOWS AND WAGER ON THESE PEOPLE LIKE THEY FROM GAME-COCKS, MY MONEY IS ON THE GUY IN 16 A. SOMEBODY PUT THEIR BAG IN HIS OVERHEAD BIN, HE HAS THE LOOK OF A KILLER. THEY CAN PACK MORE PEOPLE BACK THERE. A SAW A REVOLUTIONARY NEW SEATING DESIGN. NOT ONLY YOU CAN PACK TWICE AS MANY PEOPLE INTO COACH, YOU CAN FILL THE CARGO HOLD WITH SPICES AND MOLASSES TO BRING BACK FROM THE COLONIS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
