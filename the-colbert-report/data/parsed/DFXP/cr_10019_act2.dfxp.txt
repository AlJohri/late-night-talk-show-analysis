Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  THANK YOU SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AS YOU  KNOW, FROM WATCHING THE NEWS  AND I HOPE YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU COME TO THE SHOW, YOU  GOT TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK. YESTERDAY WAS ELECTION DAY. AND BARACK OBAMA ONCE AGAIN  MANAGED TO HOLD ON TO THE  PRESIDENCY. WASN'T EVEN ON THE BALLOT. OH, AND THERE'S NO VOTER  FRAUD, RIGHT. BUT FOLKS, THERE WAS SOME  GOOD ELECTORAL NEWS. IT LOOKS LIKE WASHINGTON  STATE VOTERS HAVE REJECTED  INITIATIVE 522, WHICH WOULD HAVE REQUIRED WARNING LABELS  FOR FOODS WITH GENETICALLY  MODIFIED INGREDIENTS. THANK GOODNESS. FOLKS, I BELIEVE IT IS NONE  OF OUR BUSINESS WHAT WE'RE  PUTTING IN OUR MOUTHS. AS A GREAT MAN ONCE SAID,  IGNORANCE IS BLISS. WHO WAS THAT MAN? DON'T KNOW, DON'T WANT TO  KNOW. (LAUGHTER)  BESIDES, I WANT GENETICALLY  MODIFIED FOODS. BECAUSE YOU ARE WHAT YOU  EAT. AND I'M HOPING ONE DAY A MUT  ANT TOMATO CAN GIVE ME HEAT  VISION. BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE A  AGAINST T JIM?
BASICALLY WHAT IT IS, IS  FOOD MADE IN A LABORATORY. UNTIL THE LAST 20 OR 30  YEARS THIS IS FOOD THAT HAS  NEVER EXISTED BEFORE IN  HUMANITY SO IT IS MADE IN A  LABORATORY. OVER 60 COUNTRIES AROUND THE  WORLD REQUIRE GMOs TO BE  LABELED BUT THE U.S. DOES  NOT.
WHAT'S EVEN SCARIER IS  THAT NOW PEOPLE IN JUST  EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIFE AND DON'T EVEN KNOW T IT'S RIGHT  IN OUR FOOD. AND THEY COULD BE CAUSING  YOU DISEASE.
RESEARCHERS HAVE NEVER  FOUND HEALTH CONSEQUENCES IN  HUMANS FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS. ONLY IN RATS.
SEE, JUST RATS. AND THE ONLY REASON WE DO  THOSE EXPERIMENTS IS TO  PROMOTE RAT HEALTH. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE  THEY'RE EATING RIGHT. PLUS MAKING BUSINESSES  PROVIDE GMO WARNING LABEL  WAS COST US ALL MONEY, RIGHT,  LADY NEWS MOUTH.
BUT SOME PEOPLE SAY IS TO  FIGURE OUT IF A FOOD THAT  MIGHT HAVE A LOT OF INGREDIENTS ARE ANY OF THEM  GENETICALLY MODIFIED, DOES  NEED TO BE LABELED THAT THAT COSTS MONEY AND WE WOULD SEE  MORE EXPENSIVE FOOD IN OUR  COMMUNITIES.
YES, AMERICA'S FOOD  MANUFACTURERS CAN'T TAKE THE  TIME AND EXPENSE TO FIND OUT IF THERE IS GENETICALLY  MODIFIED INGREDIENTS IN  THEIR FOOD. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW IF  THERE IS FOOD IN THEIR FOOD. (LAUGHTER)  AND FOX NEWS UNDERSTANDS  WHERE KNOWING THINGS WILL  LEAD.
THE REAL IMPACT WOULD  COME IF YOU SLAPPED THIS  LABEL ON THE PRODUCT, YOU SCARED CONSUMER AS WAY, THEN  THE FARMERS HAVE TO GO TO  LESS EFFICIENT TECHNIQUES.
THAT IS WHEN YOU STOP  SEEING THE SEEDLESS  WATERMELON, THE SEEDS COME  BACK.
Stephen: DID YOU HEAR  THAT? YOU HEAR THAT, NO SEEDLESS  WATERMELON. WHICH BY THE WAY ISN'T EVEN  GENETICALLY MODIFIED. THEN WHAT WILL WE DO, EAT  WATERMELONS WITH SEEDS? WHAT ARE WE, ANIMALS? QUESTIONING WHAT IS ON YOUR  PLATE IS UNAMERICAN, FOLKS. YOU THINK THE PILGRIMS ASKED  THE INDIANS OH, IS THIS  MAIZE GENETICALLY MODIFIED? IS THIS SQUASH LOCALLY  SOURCED?
NO, THEY ATE IT BECAUSE  THEY WERE STARVING. AND EVERY DAY AMERICANS  HONOR THE PILGRIMS BY EATING  AS IF WE ARE STARVING. AND JUST FORGET, PLEASE  FORGET LABELING AT  RESTAURANT CHAINS. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THE  CONTENTS OF STARBUCKS LEMON  LOAF CAKE. THE WORD LOAF TELLS ME ALL I  NEED TO KNOW. AND DON'T TELL ME ABOUT THE  ANTI-FOAMING AGENT IN MY  CHICKEN McNUG ETS. THAT RUINS THE SURPRISE WHEN  MY MOUTH DOESN'T FOAM. I SAY WE GET RID OF ALL  LABELS. ALL FOOD SHOULD COME IN AN  UNMARKED BOX. LIKE MY NEW LINE OF SNACK  FOODS STEPHEN COLBERT'S JUST  EAT IT. EVERY BOX COMES WITH A  COMPLIMENTARY BLINDFOLD. YOU PUT ON THE BLINDFOLD,  OPEN THE BOX, AND STICK IT  IN YOUR MOUTH. (LAUGHTER)  THOUGH WORD OF WARNING,  DON'T LET IT NEAR YOUR RAT,  OR HE IS A DEAD MAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. CHEERS BECAUSE
