[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK  CALLED "THE CREATIVE DESTRUCTION  OF MEDICINE."  I'M WAITING FOR THE GENERIC VERSION FROM CANADA. PLEASE WELCOME DOCTOR ERIC  TOPOL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU ARE THE CHIEF ACADEMIC  AUTHOR AT SCRIPPS HEALTH. COFOUNDER OF WEST WIRELESS  HEALTH INSTITUTE IN LA JOLLA  SCAL FORN AND YOU ARE A CARDIOLOGIST YOURSELF. YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK HERE CALLED  "THE CREATIVE DESTRUCTION OF  MEDICINE. " WHY DO WE WANT TO DESTROY  MEDICINE? IT'S KEEPING AWS LIVE. LEAVE IT ALEN.
THERE'S A TALK ABOUT  TRANSFORMING RADICAL INNOVATION,  CREATIVE DESTRUCT. WE HAVE NEW TOOLS IN MEDICINE TO  BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND EACH  PERSON AT AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WE NEVER COULD BEFORE. WE HAVE SMART PHONES AND  TABLETS.
Stephen: I HAVE A  SMARTPHONE AM I A DOCTOR?
YOU KNOW WHAT IS DIFFERENT? THAT SMARTPHONE IS SAY CONDUIT  WITH DATE WHY AND INFORMATION  ABOUT YOUR HEALTH LIKE YOUR MEDICAL ESSENCE LIKE YOU'VE  NEVER HAD BEFORE.
Stephen: HOW CAN I SMART  PHONE TELL ME ABOUT ME? DID SIRI TELL YOU? HOLD ON ONE SECOND. SIRI AM I DYING?
I REALLY CAN'T SAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
LET'S CONVERT THE SMARTPHONE  TO A MEDICAL DEVICE. LET'S DO A CARDIOGRAM. PUT YOUR FINGERS ON IT AND MAKE  A CIRCUIT WITH YOUR HEART. WE'LL GET THIS UP AND IT'S A WAY  TO GET YOUR CARDIOGRAM RIGHT  THERE. YOU HAVE A NICE PACEMAKER. I MEAN YOUR NORMAL PACE, RHYTHM.
Stephen: IS THAT GOOD?
IT'S PERFECT. SO FAR YOU ARE DOING PRETTY  WELL.
Stephen: WHAT ELSE CAN MY  PHONE DO?
BEFORE WE GET DO THAT WE CAN  DO INFENCIVE -- ON THE WRIST. LIKE I SHOWED YOU THIS --
Stephen: I HAVE ONE OF  THOSE.
BEYOND THAT I'M GOING TO GO  TO MY BLOOD PRESSURE. THIS IS MY CONTINUOUS BLOOD  PRESSURE, EVERY BEAT WITH A WAVE  FORM RIGHT ABOVE IT AND BEYOND THAT I HAVE MY OXYGEN SATURATION  IN THE BLOOD.
Stephen: HOW IS IT DOING  THAT?
ALL THROUGH THE SENSORS.
Stephen: ON YOUR THUMB  THERE, OKAY.
AND TEMPERATURE AND  EVERYTHING STEERCHGHTS WHY WOULD  I WANT THAT? I HAVE A DOCTOR TO DO. THAT I COMPLAIN TO THE DOCTOR. HE SAYS YOU'LL BE FINE AND GIVES  ME A PILL.
YOU CAN DO MONITORING  ANYWHERE. SO YOUR PHONE --
Stephen: WHAT IF I'M HAVING  A HEART ATTACK OR SOMETHING. THEY CAN PROCESS THAT SIGNAL ARC  LAVES AND THAT COULD BASICALLY  COME RALLY -- SIGNAL, ALARMS AND THAT COULD FIND YOU WHEREVER YOU  ARE.
Stephen: I'M HAVING A  HEARTATTACK IT CALLS MY PHONE  AND PLAYS DUN, DUN, DUN -- THE GRIM REAPER.
AT SCRIPPS WE'RE PUTTING  SENSORS THAT WILL SENSE IF YOU  ARE GOING TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK DAYS OR A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE  AND GIVE YOU A HEART ATTACK  RINGTONE TO WARN YOU. PREVENT IT.
Stephen: REALLY? I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN  THE LINE THAT THE INSURANCE  COMPANY WILL GIVE YOU A CUT IF YOU HAVE A MONITOR ON YOU.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: STAY HEALTHIER BUT  THEY'LL SELL THAT INFORMATION  ABOUT YOUR PRESENT HEALTH TOLL OTHER PEOPLE AND I'LL GET A  RINGTONE SAYING, WOULD YOU LIKE  208% OFF ON CASKETS OR CRESTOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
IT'S COMING.
Stephen: IF I'M DOING THE  MONITORING, WHY DO I NEED THE  DOCTOR?
THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO SO --
Stephen: WHERE DID I GO?
I SAW ON TWITTER THAT YOU HAD  AN EARDRUM.
DIVING I BLEW OUT MY GOOD  EAR.
I THOUGHT YOU COULD TAKE A  LOOK WITH THE SMARTPHONE. SO BASICALLY I PUT THIS RIGHT IN  HERE AND I HOPE I DON'T HURT YOU  AT ALL.
Stephen: I HOPE SO, TOO. OW!
DOES THAT HURT?
Stephen: NO.
I HAVE YOUR EARDRUM RIGHT  THERE.
Stephen: IT'S AN EARDRUM  IT'S NOT MY ASS. [LAUGHTER] CAN I GET A COLONOSCOPY WITH  THIS THING?
IT'S HEALING.
Stephen: IT'S HEALING? IT'S DOING OKAY.
YOU ARE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT  WITH THAT.
Stephen: THANKS VERY MUCH. CAN I -- IF I'M PART -- I'M PART  OF THE DOCTOR HERE CAN I GET A  PRESCRIPTION PAD BECAUSE THERE'S VICODIN COUGH SYRUP I WANT TO  GET MY HANDS ON, WHATEVER LIL  WAYNE IS DRINKING. [LAUGHTER] DOCTOR, THANK FOUR JOININGING  ME.
