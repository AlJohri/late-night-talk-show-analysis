[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION'S REGULATORY  CZAR. I DON'T CARE WHAT HE SAYS I'M  GOING TO RUN OVER THERE WITH THE  SCISSORS. PLEASE WELCOME CASS SUNSTEIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HEY, MR. SUNSTEIN THANKS FOR  COMING ON. ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE BEEN A BIT OF MY WHITE  WHALE FOR A FEW YEARS. I'VE BEEN READY TO BRING IT HOT  AND HARD TO YOU BECAUSE -- [LAUGHTER] -- BECAUSE IN 2009 TO 2012 YOU  WERE ADMINISTRATOR OF WHITE  HOUSE OFFICE FOR INFORMATION AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS, UNOFFICIALLY  KNOWN AS OBAMA'S REGULATORY  CZAR. THOSE ARE TWO EXTREMELY  UNAPPEALING WORDS. REGULATORY CZAR, OKAY? COMMUNIST KING. NOW YOU HAVE A BOOK EXPLAINING  YOURSELF OVER HERE. IT'S CALLED:  "SIMPLER THE  FUTURE OF GOVERNMENT."  WHAT WAS THAT LIKE TO BE THE  REGULATORY CZAR YOU ARE THE GUY WHO STRANGLED THE ECONOMY IN ITS  CRIB, AREN'T YOU?
THE GOAL WASN'T TO STRANGLE  THE ECONOMY.
Stephen: THAT WAS JUST A  BONUS.
THE ECONOMY IS DOING A LITTLE  BIT BETTER NOW THAN IT WAS BACK  THEN AND THE GOAL WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RULES WERE  SENSIBLE, THAT THEY STRUCK THE  RIGHT BALANCE AND YOU PROTECT PEOPLE AGAINST UNSAFE FOOD OR  DIRTY AIR OR DIRTY WATER OR  NATIONAL SECURITY RISKS WHILE PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH.
Stephen: YOU WASH OUT YOUR  MOUTH, SIR. DON'T YOU DARE USE REAGAN'S MAKE NAME  WHY YOUR ARGUMENT. YOU WANT TO MAKE THINGS SIMMER. WHAT IS THE SIMPLEST POSSIBLE  GOVERNMENT? AN ARMY THAT BUILDS ROADS. WHY DO WE NEED ANYTHING ELSE?
THAT IS IMPORTANT, ROADS AND  AN ARMY BUT IT'S PRETTY  IMPORTANT TO HAVE AIR THAT IS CLEAN AND WATER THAT IS SAFE TO  DRINK.
Stephen: WHY DON'T WE LET  THE FREE MARKET DECIDE WHETHER  MERCURY IS BAD FOR ME.
IT DOESN'T ENTIRELY WORK. IT COULD HURT KIDS NEUROLOGIC  ALLY AND WHY BUSINESSES ARE  TRYING TO REDUCE POLLUTION LEVELS THEY HAVEN'T SUCCEEDED.
Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR IDEA  OF SIMPLIFYING THINGS. IT ZNLT SEEM LIKE IT'S SIMPLER  THAN IT USED TO BE.
UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA THE  PAPERWORK BURDEN ON THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE IS LOWER.
Stephen: THEY ARE CERTAINLY  CASHING FEWER CHECKS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IS THERE A GOVERNMENT MANDATED  AT THE TIMEOUS SHOT BECAUSE --  TETANUS SHOT BECAUSE YOU JUST GOT NAILED, MY FRIEND.
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME NUMBERS  WHICH ARE THE HIGHEST COST YEAR  WAS 2007 UNDER THE PREVIOUS  PRESIDENT.
Stephen: HIGHEST COST YEAR?
FOR REGULATION. THE NUMBER OF RULES ISSUED IN  THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  SMALLER. THE NUMBER OF RULES ISSUED THAN  THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. THE NUMBER OF RULES DOWN, COST  OF RULES DOWN.
Stephen: YOUR RULES ARE A  LITTLE DIFFERENT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IMPLEMENTED  BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE IDEA OF  THE BOOK IS YOU WANT TO NUDGE PEOPLE LIKE NASA WANTS TO NUDGE  THE ASTEROID. YOU WANT TO NUDGE PEOPLE?
IT'S A FREEDOM PRESERVING LOW  COST REMEDY. IF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE  RISK THEY ARE TAKING WHEN THEY  ARE TAKING A LOAN OUT OR CREDIT CARD A NUDGE WOULD INFORM THEM.
Stephen: WHAT IS A NUDGE  THAT EXISTS NOW.
SOME OF THE REALLY GOOD ONES  ARE DISCLOSURES THAT TELL PEOPLE  STUFF. THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT THE  UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF  AGRICULTURE HAD CALLED THE FOOD  PYRAMID. IT WAS REALLY COMPLICATED. THERE'S A GUY WITHOUT SHOES  WALKING TO THE TOP OF PYRAMID  AND THERE ARE FOODS BUNCHED TOGETHER AT THE BOTTOM. ONE OF WHICH LOOKS LIKE A SHOE. THAT'S NOT A GOOD NUDGE IT'S A  BAFFLING THING IT'S A BAD NUDGE.
Stephen: YOU SAY THE GPS IS  A GOOD NUDGE.
WE GOT RID OF A FOOD PYRAMID  IT'S MORE LOOK A FOOD PLATE. PEOPLE CAN EAT STEAK AND  CHOCOLATE BUT THE PLATE SAYS  MAKE HALF YOUR PLATE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES YOU'LL PROBABLY BE ON  THE RIGHT TRACK. IT'S LIKE A GPS. IF YOU WANT TO MEANDER ON THE  STREET AND GET LOST, YOU CAN  IGNORE YOUR GPS.
Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT AND  THEN GPS ALSO JUDGES YOU. IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE GPS'  ROUTE IT GOES RECALCULATING.
THE FOOD PLATE DOESN'T JUDGE  YOU.
Stephen: IT DOESN'T? RECALCULATING YOUR WEIGHT. NO? CASS SUNSTEIN THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. THE IDEA IS SIMPLE. THE BOOK IS
