( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NATION, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WATCH  THE NEWS AS MUCH AS I DO, YOU  KNOW THAT EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, THERE'S BAD NEWS: TV, INTERNET,  NEWSPAPERS, EVEN ON THE COMICS  PAGE. LAST WEEK GARFIELD FINALLY  SUCCUMBED TO HIS CHRONIC  DEPRESSION OVER MONDAYS. HE IS SURVIVED BY ODIE, JON AND  A LASAGNA. BUT, NATION, I'M GOING TO GIVE  YOU SOME GOOD NEWS. THIS IS TINY TRIUMPHS. HUMANITY HAS ACCOMPLISHED SO  MUCH OVER THE YEARS. WE SPLIT THE ATOM. WE MAPPED THE HUMAN GENOME. WE PUT PIZZA ON A BAGEL. NOW WE CAN HAVE PIZZA ANY TIME. BUT ALL THIS ACHIEVEMENT RAISES  THE TROUBLING QUESTION: IS THERE  ANYTHING LEFT FOR US TO CONQUER? AND IT ALSO RAISES THE TROUBLING  ANSWER: YES. BECAUSE WE HAVE NOW FOUND A  BOLD, NEW FRONTIER ON MARS. WE'VE BEEN SENDING PROBES THERE  SINCE THE 1970s, MOST RECENTLY  THE CURIOSITY ROVER WHICH IN SEARCH OF EVIDENCE OF LIFE HAS  BEEN DRIVING ACROSS THE HARSH  MARTIAN SANDS WITH ITS EIGHT STURDY WHEELS WE HAVE LEFT  HUMANITY'S MARK AND ACHIEVED  SOMETHING WE CAN TRULY BE PROUD  OF. WE DREW A PENIS ON MARS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THIS IS ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN,  ONE GIANT DOODLE OF MAN-JUNK. THIS GIANT GRAFFITI. PEENIE PROVES OUR GALACTIC  SUPREMACY. AMERICA TOOK A PRISTINE PLANET  140 MILLION MILES AWAY AND  SCRIBBLED ON IT LIKE IT WAS THE FACE OF A PASSED-OUT FRAT BOY. AND NOW THAT WE'VE DRAWN THIS  PENIS ON IT, THAT OFFICIALLY  MAKES THE SPACE BETWEEN MARS AND URANUS OUR SOLAR SYSTEM'S TAINT. THAT'S JUST SCIENCE. BUT PERHAPS WHAT'S MOST MOVING  IS THAT THIS CHILDISH VANDALISM  FINALLY FULFILLS JOHN F. KENNEDY'S VISION AS HE LAID OUT  IN HIS 1962 SPEECH.
WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON  AND TO DRAW A PENIS NOT BECAUSE  IT IS BUT BECAUSE IT IS  HILARIOUS.
Stephen: AND IT'S CLEAR AND  IT IS SO CLEAR THAT OUR WEARY  COUNTRY IS UNITED AS ONE BEHIND THIS HOPEFUL IMAGE OF MAN'S  FULL, THROBBING POTENTIAL. BECAUSE THE PHOTO HAS BEEN SO  POPULAR ONLINE THAT IT CAUSED  THE NASA WEBSITE TO CRASH. SOMETHING THAT HASN'T HAPPENED  SINCE THOSE PHOTOS SURFACED OF A  BUZZ ALDRIN NIP SLIP. SO I WANT TO SALUTE NASA FOR  ONCE AGAIN INSPIRING A  GENERATION. SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA THERE'S A  LITTLE BOY LOOKING UP AT THE  STARS AND THINKING, "ONE DAY I'M GOING TO GROW UP AND LIVE MY  DREAM: DRAWING A BUILD OLD PAIR  OF TIT-TAYS ON NEP EWEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
