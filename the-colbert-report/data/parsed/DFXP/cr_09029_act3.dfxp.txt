(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE ORIGINAL  VOICE OF BOTH YODA AND COOKIE  MONSTER. I'LL ASK HIM IF FOUR COOKIE Cs. PLEASE WELCOME FRANK OZ. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU, HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU  FRANK OZ. CAN I CALL YOU FRANK OZ.
YOU CAN.
Stephen: FRANK OZ --
CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING?
Stephen: YES.
MY FAVORITE PART OF YOUR SHOW  BAR NONE IS WHEN YOU INTRODUCE  THE GUEST AND YOU COME HERE AND TAKE A BOW. (LAUGHTER)  I LOVE THAT.
Stephen: WELL, I'VE GOT TO  GIVE THESE PEOPLE WHAT THEY  WANT.
IT'S GREAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S GREAT  TO HEAR.
I MEAN IT, I THINK IT'S  HYSTERICAL, AND YOU DESERVE IT.
Stephen: THANK YOU, I PUT THE  MOST THOUGHT INTO IT.
OF COURSE.
Stephen: WELL, EVERYBODY  KNOWS YOU, OF COURSE, AS BEING  THE VOICE OF MISS PIGGY, THE VOICE OF GROVER, THE VOICE OF  FOZ ZI BEAR, THE VOICE OF ANIMAL  AND THE VOICE OF YODA.
YEAH, IT'S SO WEIRD, THOUGH.
Stephen: WHAT'S WEIRD.
THAT YOU SAY "THE VOICE OF."  SO WHAT WHO DOES THE CHARACTER?
Stephen: THE PERSON DOES. FOZZIE THE CHARACTER.
Stephen:
PHYSICALLY HOW IS IT?
Stephen: WELL, ISN'T THERE A  REAL YODA? OH, OKAY, SO YOU DO ALL THAT  STUFF.
IT'S SO WEIRD. PEOPLE ARE SO USED TO ANIMATION  THAT PEOPLE JUST DO THE VOICES,  BUT WHEN THE PERFORMERS, THE MUPPETS DO IT, IT'S -- THE  VOICES ARE ONLY 10%, THE REST IS  90% OF IT.
Stephen: OKAY. OKAY.
92%.
Stephen: DO YOU EVER GET  PISSED OFF THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE  THE MUPPET MORE THAN THEY RECOGNIZE YOU? (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN, BECAUSE -- ARE YOU EVER  TEMPTED TO MAKE A MUPPET THAT  LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE FRANK OZ SO YOU CAN GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT  MUPPET LOVE YOURSELF? (LAUGHTER)  NOT THAT YOU'RE NOT SLIGHTLY  MUPPETISH.
I'M THRILLED. I CAN -- I CAN BE -- BE THE STAR  AND THEN I CAN GO BUY MY PORK  AND BEANS OR DO MY LAUNDRY.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE A  BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL DAY. PORK AND BEANS AND LAUNDRY. YOU LIVE THE HIGH LIFE, MAN! YOU ARE LIVING THE DREAM!
MUNDANE STUFF LIKE THAT, IT'S  WONDERFUL.
Stephen: ARE THERE MUPPET  GROUPPYS? LIKE ANIMAL IS A DRUMMER. DOES ANIMAL GET ANY ACTION?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ACTION?
Stephen: WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ACTION?
Stephen: GROUPIES, MAN, WE'RE  ALL ADULTS. ACTION, MUPPET SEX. (LAUGHTER)
SO YOU SAID IT.
Stephen: YOU MADE ME SAY IT.
I DIDN'T ASK YOU.
Stephen: I INSINUATED AND YOU  EXSIN WAITED.
I MIGHT HAVE DRAWN YOU OUT,  BUT IT WAS THERE.
Stephen: DO MUPPETS HAVE SEX? (LAUGHTER)
WHAT? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I'M WONDERING HOW  YOU GET NEW MUPPETS, IS ALL I'M  ASKING. HOW DO YOU GET NEW MUPPETS?
I'M A BIG BOY.
Stephen: WE'RE ALL ADULTS  HERE.
WELL, I DON'T ACTUALLY -- I  HAVEN'T PERFORMED THERE THE  MUPPETS FOR MANY YEARS AND WHEN I DID I DIDN'T MAKE THE  CHARACTERS. THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF  PEOPLE WHO WERE VERY TALENTED  WHO WERE THE WORKSHOP WHO MADE THE CHARACTERS.
Stephen: SO THAT'S WHERE THE  ACTION IS.
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT  ACTUALLY HAPPENS THERE, WHETHER  THERE'S ACTION OR NOT.
Stephen: IT'S A FAMILY SHOW.
BUT IT WAS DONE IN THE  WORKSHOP.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD. YOU WERE FAMOUS FOR DIRECTING  "LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS."
I AM.
Stephen: IT'S A CULT CLASSIC  FROM 1986.
AROUND THERE.
Stephen: 25th ANNIVERSARY OF  THE MOVIE IS COMING. THERE'S A NEW ENDING ON THE END.
YES. WELL, IT'S THE ORIGINAL ENDING.
Stephen: NOT THE ENDING I  SAW. I SAW IT IN THE THEATER, IT HAD  A HAPPY ENDING.
IT HAD A HAPPY ENDING, BUT  THE ORIGINAL ENDING-- WHICH IS  ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WORK BY RICHARD CONWAY-- WAS  EXCISED ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO  BECAUSE THE SCORES WERE SO LOW THAT THEY WOULD NOT RETHERE'S  MOVIE --.
Stephen: WHEN THEY DO MARKET  TESTING? SHOWED IT TO THE AUDIENCE?
AND I DIDN'T DO THE MARKET  TESTING. I WAS THERE AT A SAN JOSE  SCREENING AND THEY LOVED THE  SHOW UNTIL WE KILLED THE TWO STARS ELLEN AND RICK. SO THEREFORE HOWARD ASHMAN, WHO  IS BRILLIANT-- AND I KNEW WE HAD  TO DO IT-- WE HAD TO HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.
Stephen: LET'S LOOK AT THE  ORIGINAL ENDING. WE'LL SHOW IT RIGHT HERE. (SCREAMING)  (LAUGHING)  ♪ ♪
Stephen: THAT WAS A LITTLE  TABLE TOP --
IT WAS A LITTLE TASTE OF --.
Stephen: THAT WAS TABLE TOP  --
THAT'S ALL REAL. ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WAS ABOUT A YEAR'S WORK.
Stephen: THAT'S THE END OF  THE WORLD!
YES, YES.
Stephen: AND IN THE FIRST  VERSION YOU HAD A HAPPY ENDING. DO YOU PREFER THAT OR THIS?
HOWARD AND I BOTH PREFERRED  THAT.
Stephen: WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST  STICK TO YOUR GUNS?
BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I'M IN AN  AUDIENCE AND I CAN FEEL THEM  TOTALLY AGAINST ME --.
Stephen: RIGHT NOW, LIKE  RIGHT NOW.
LIKE NOW. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S A VERY WELL-KNOWN FEELING I  HAVE. THEN I DON'T NEED CARDS. AND WE DID A SECOND PREVIEW IN  LOS ANGELES AND I ASK DAVID  GEFFEN IF WE COULD DO IT AGAIN, SAME THING HAPPENED.
Stephen: SO WHY CHANGE IT? I PAID GOOD MONEY TO SEE THE  HAPPY ENDING IN 1986. WHY CHANGE THIS? YOU HAD A PERFECTLY FINE -- YOU  DON'T CHANGE THE ENDING TO A  CLASSIC, YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T CHANGE ROSE BUD INTO A  SNOW CONE MACHINE.
Stephen: YOU PREFER THE HAPPY  ENDING?
I ENJOY WHATEVER ENDING I  PAID FOR ORIGINALLY. I'M A CONSERVATIVE AND I DON'T  LIKE THINGS TO CHANGE. (LAUGHTER)
OKAY. I JUST WANTED TO DO IT -- I  WOULD HAVE ASKED YOU FIRST, BUT  I WANTED TO --  (LAUGHTER) I WANTED -- I SHOULD HAVE. I JUST WANTED TO GIVE RICHARD  CONWAY HIS DUES. HIS TEAM DID ALL THE WORK SO  THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO DO IT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, OKAY. ARE YOU GOING TO CHANGE THE  ENDING OF ANY OTHER MOVIES? MAKE THOSE DOWNERS?
NO, I PROMISE I WON'T.
Stephen: REALLY.
NO.
Stephen: END OF "IN AND OUT"  MAYBE KEVIN KLEIN IS CRUSHED TO  DEATH? SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
(LAUGHS)
Stephen: BERT AND ERNIE,  THAT'S A STRAIGHT SITUATION,  RIGHT? (LAUGHTER)  TOTALLY STRAIGHT? BECAUSE I HEAR THINGS. ARE YOU EVER TEMPTED TO USE YOUR  CHARACTER'S VOICES TO GET OUT OF  BAD SITUATIONS?
LIKE WHAT SITUATIONS?
Stephen: JUMP INTO YODA WHEN  YOU'RE PULLED OVER AND SAY (AS  YODA)  "NOT SPEEDING, WAS I, OFFICER?" (LAUGHTER)
NO.
Stephen: YOU'RE MISSING OUT  ON A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
(LAUGHS)
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE  LIVING YOUR LIFE? I KNOW THEY'RE NOT VOICES,  THEY'RE CHARACTERS, BUT WHAT IS  IT LIKE BEING FAMOUS FOR A CHARACTER WHO ISN'T YOU? WHO GETS TO SAY AND DO THINGS  YOU DON'T GET TO DO? (LAUGHTER)  I'M ASKING FOR A FRIEND. (LAUGHTER)  IS THAT FUN? DID YOU ENJOY THAT?
(LAUGHS)  FRANK, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. FRANK OZ. "LITTLE SHOP OF
