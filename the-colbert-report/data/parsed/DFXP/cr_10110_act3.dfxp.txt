( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS IN CHARGE OF 900,000 MEMBERS OF THE NAVY AND MARINE CORPS. I CERTAINLY HOPE HE'S ORDERED THEM TO TUNE IN TONIGHT. PLEASE WELCOME SECRETARY OF THE NAVY RAY MABUS.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SECRETARY MABUS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. SIR, NICE TO HAVE YOU ON.
GLAD TO BE HERE.
Stephen:  HAPPY FLEET WEEK.
THANK YOU. IT'S A GREAT, GREAT FLEET WEEK.
Stephen:  IT ABSOLUTELY IS. BUT, PLEASE, BE CAREFUL OUT THERE. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU IN A LITTLE SAILOR SUIT RUNNING AROUND TOWN SINGING, "NEW YORK, NEW YORK." ALL RIGHT?
DEAL, NEITHER SHOULD YOU.
Stephen:  STAY AWAY FROM THE PAINTED LADIES. NOW, SECRETARY OF THE NAVY, WERE YOU IN THE NAVY?
YES, 40 YEARS AGO.
Stephen: 40 YEARS AGO. WHAT WAS YOUR RANK?
LIEUTENANT J.G. ON A CRUISER IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC.
Stephen:  DOES IT FEEL GOOD NOW TO BE HEAD MAN?
YEAH.
Stephen:  DO YOU WISH YOU COULD GET IN A TIME MACHINE AND GO BACK AND SAY, "HANG IN THERE, BUDDY. YOU GET TO BOSS THESE PEOPLE AROUND LATER."
THE MOST AMAZED PEOPLE WERE THE PEOPLE ON MY SHIP WHEN I GOT APPOINTED TO THIS JOB.
Stephen:  DID THEY TESTIFY AGAINST YOU IN FRONT OF THE SENATE?
IF THEY WERE STILL ALIVE.
OOOOOH!
Stephen:  HE MEANS HOW OLD THEY ARE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. OKAY. THE NAVY.
THE NAVY.
Stephen:  THE NAVY, YOU GUYS GOT-- YOU GOT-- YOU GOT BOATS FOR THE WATER. YOU GOT SEALs FOR THE LAND. YOU GOT JETS FOR THE SKY. DO WE NEED THE OTHER BRANCHES OF THE MILITARY? OR CAN THE NAVY JUST HANDLE ALL OF IT?
YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT THE MARINE CORPS, TOO.
Stephen:  RIGHT.
SURE.
Stephen:  SO TOGETHER, UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, HAVE YOU GUYS GOT IT COVERED?
WE'RE THE GREATEST FIGHTING FORCE THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.
Stephen:  HOW DOES THE ARMY FEEL ABOUT THAT STATEMENT?
BUT WE NEED OUR SISTER SERVICES.
Stephen:  YOU NEED THEM?
WE NEED OUR SISTER SERVICES. WE NEED A GREAT ARMY. WE NEED A GREAT AIR FORCE.
Stephen:  HOW IS THE NAVY DOING RIGHT NOW? HOW MANY SHIPS HAVE WE GOT?
THE NAVY'S DOING GREAT. WE HAVE 289 SHIPS AND BUILDING TO   306 BY THE END OF THIS DECADE.
Stephen:  WHAT ARE THE EXTRA ONES ON TOP THERE, ALL AIRCRAFT CARRIERS, RIGHT?
NOT QUITE.
Stephen:  HOW MANY AIRCRAFT CARRIERS DO WE HAVE, SIR?
11.
Stephen:  MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE CAN PARK ONE OF THOSE BAD BOYS OFF THE COAST OF ANY COUNTRY AND SHUT DOWN THEIR AIR SPACE. IS THAT TRUE?
WE CAN PARK ONE OF THOSE ALMOST ANYWHERE AND DO WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY FAVORITE RECRUITING POSTER IS A CARRIER STRYKER WITH ALL THE PLANES, AND IT SAYS, "SOMETIMES WE FOLLOW THE STORM TO THE SHORE.  SOMETIMES WE ARE THE STORM." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  THAT, FOR ANY OF THE SAILORS HERE FOR FLEET WEEK, THAT'S A GREAT PICKUP LINE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). OKAY, NOW, OKAY, MODERN WARFARE. DO WE NEED A MASSIVE NAVY ANYMORE? WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING A LOT OF WARS, AND SOME KIND OF DUSTY, DRY PLACES THAT IT WOULD BE HARD TO BRING A BOAT-- IT'S HARD TO BRING A BOAT ALL THE WAY TO KABUL. DO WE NEED A BIG NAVY ANYMORE?
WE NEED A BIG NAVY BECAUSE 90% OF THE WORLD'S TRADE TRAVELS BY SEA. 95% OF OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS GO UNDER THE SEA. KEEPING THE SEA LANES OPEN, OUR PRESENCE AROUND THE WORLD TO DETER FOLKS FROM DOING BAD THINGS, TO REASSURE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUR ALLIES, WE NEED A GREAT NAVY. WE'VE GOT A MARITIME DEFENSE STRATEGY NOW.
Stephen:  IS GLOBAL WARMING GOOD FOR YOU GUYS? BECAUSE WITH RISING SEA LEVELS, THERE WILL BE MORE OCEAN FOR YOU TO NAVY IN? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) 50 YEARS FROM NOW, 50 YEARS FROM NOW, FLEET WEEK IS GOING TO BE IN COLUMBUS, OHIO.
THAT'S WHY ONE OF OUR BIGGEST BASES IS IN INDIANA.
Stephen:  IS IT REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen:  THERE'S A NAVAL BASE IN INDIANA?
YEAH.
Stephen:  THAT'S A GOOD CONGRESSMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THAT'S A REALLY GOOD CONGRESSMAN. WOW.
WE DO HAVE MORE OCEAN TO NAVY ON, AND WHEN THE-- AS THE ICE IS MELTING IN THE ARCTIC, OUR RESPONSIBILITIES INCREASE. 40% OF-- 70% OF THE WORLD LIVES WITHIN 40 MILES OF AN OCEAN. SO AS SEA LEVELS RISE, INSTABILITY FOLLOWS. THAT GIVES US MORE RESPONSIBILITIES.
Stephen:  YOU GET TO-- YOU GET TO NAME SHIPS, DON'T YOU?
I DO.
Stephen:  YOU KNOW WHAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE USS "STEPHEN COLBERT." DOESN'T THAT JUST ROLL OFF THE TONGUE, SIR? ( APPLAUSE ).
YOU KNOW, IT DOES. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO BE DEAD FIRST.
Stephen:  OH! LIKE SUPER DEAD? OR JUST A LITTLE DEAD?
YOU KNOW, WE CAN MAKE EXCEPTIONS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  SECRETARY MABUS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. SECRETARY OF THE NAVY, RAY MABUS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
