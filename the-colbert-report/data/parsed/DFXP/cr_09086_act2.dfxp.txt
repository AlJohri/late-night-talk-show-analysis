(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Colbert: THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE, SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK. NATION, I'LL TELL YOU, FOLKS,  I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I AM NO  GOOD WHEN IT COMES TO COOKING. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I TRY  TO MAKE THE PERFECT SOUFFLE,  ROSITA JUST SEEMS TO GET IT  WRONG. MAYBE I'M NOT YELLING LOUD  ENOUGH. I DON'T KNOW. BUT THE THING THAT GIVES ME THE  MOST TROUBLE IN THE KITCHEN IS  COOKING EGGS. I MEAN, ONCE YOU CRACK THEM  OPEN, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO  REMEMBER WHICH PART WAS THE INSIDE AND WHICH PART WAS THE  OUTSIDE? LABELS, PLEASE. THAT'S WHY I WAS SO EXCITED TO  SEE THAT THERE IS FINALLY A  PRODUCT ON THE MARKET THAT MAKES COOKING EGGS POSSIBLE.
MAKING EGGS MAKE A MESS. THEY STICK TO THE PAN. THEY FLOP WHEN YOU FLIP. AND THEY ALWAYS DRIP. AND AFTER YOU COOK THEM UP  THERE'S ALL THAT CLEAN UP. WHAT YOU NEED IS THE ROLLIE EGG  MASTER, THE FAST, EASY,  PAN-FREEWAY TO MAKE PERFECT EGGS EVERY TIME.
Colbert: YES, THE ROLLIE EGG  MASTER. FOLKS, THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN  WAITING FOR. AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, HOW  CAN I MAKE MY BREAKFAST FIT MORE  SLUGLY INTO MY COLON? AND THE ROLLIE EGG MASTER IS SO  SIMPLE TO USE. JUST CRACK AND POUR IN THE EGGS. AND BEFORE YOU CAN SAY "ISN'T  COOKING EGGS SO EASY YOU CAN  ACTUALLY DO IT ON A SIDEWALK?" PRESTO, THEY'RE DONE. THEN JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH AS  YOUR EGGS ARE SLOWLY EXTRUDED  TOWARDS YOU LIKE AN ANGRY TUBE WORM EMERGING FROM ITS HOST. AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO AN  INCREDIBLE INNOVATION IN FOOD  PREP.
THE SECRET IS VERTICAL  COOKING TECHNOLOGY THAT COMBINES  A CYLINDRICAL NONSTICK COOKING SURFACE SURROUNDED BY A  REVOLUTIONARY HEATING ELEMENT.
Colbert: YES, VERTICAL  COOKING TECHNOLOGY WHICH BEAT  OUT ITS ORIGINAL NAME  UP-POOPING. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE BEST  PART ABOUT THIS YOLK-CELLENT  PRODUCT.
AND WHAT MAKES ROLLIE EGG  REALLY GREAT IS THEIR NEW  EASY-TO-EAT SHAPE
Colbert: FINALLY AN EGG SHAPE  THAT'S EASY TO CONSUME. THE OLD EGG SHAPES WERE SO  CONFUSING. CIRCLES, ELLIPSOIDS. MOIST LUMPS. WHAT DO THEY THINK MY MOUTH IS  MADE OF? TEETH? AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,  GREG. YOU'RE SAYING A GELATINOUS EGG  CYLINDER IS GREAT FOR BREAKFAST  BUT WHAT IF I WANT TO ENJOY A TUBE OF EGGS ON THE GO? THE ROLLIE EGG MASTER HAS AN  ANSWER FOR THAT TOO
BECAUSE OF THEIR ROUND SHAPE  YOU CAN TAKE THEM FOR A QUICK  MEAL ON THE RUN. IT'S PERFECT FOR THE OFFICE
Colbert: I KNOW WHEN I'M  WORKING LONG HOURS AND I WANT TO  TAKE A BREAK THERE'S NOTHING MORE REFRESHING THAN A HOT EGG  ROD. REALLY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   THERE'S REASONABLE ONE PROBLEM I  HAVE WITH THE EGG MASTER. EVEN WITH A PRODUCT AS WONDEROUS  AS THE EGG MASTER I'M AFRAID I'M  NOT GETTING EGGS AS FRESH AS THEY COULD BE. THAT'S WHY IN CONJUNCTION WITH  THE GOOD PEOPLE AT PRESCOTT  APPLIANCES, I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE THE ROLLIE RHODE  ISLAND RED, MMMM... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   THE FIRST GENETICALLY MODIFIED  CHICKEN THAT CAN DELIVER HOT, READY-TO-EAT EGGS RIGHT TO YOUR  MOUTH. HERE'S WHAT YOU DO. YOU SIMPLY FEED THE ROL ERODE  ISLAND RED WHATEVER YOU LIKE IN  YOUR OMLETTE -- PEPPERS, HAM, CHEESE -- OKAY. GIVE HIM A GOOD SHAKE, OKAY. AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO... HOLD  ON THERE, ROLLIE. THEN YOU JUST PLUG HIM IN. PLUG HIM IN LIKE THAT. GET THAT PLUGGED IN RIGHT THERE. AND THEN MMM, MMMM, MMMM, TURN  IT OVER AND LEAVE THE REST TO  OUR PATENTED OVIDUCT COOKING  TECHNOLOGY. MMMMMM. (CHICKEN CLUCKING) MMMM. MMMM. MMMM. OH, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, FOLKS. THERE IS NOTHING LIKE BREAKFAST  STRAIGHT FROM THE EGG HOLE. AND, OH, REST UP, ROLLIE, I'M  HOSTING A BRUNCH THIS SUNDAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
