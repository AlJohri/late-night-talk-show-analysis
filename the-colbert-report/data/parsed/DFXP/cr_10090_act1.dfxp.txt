Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. THANKS SO MUCH.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'VE GOT TO-- FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YOU, ONE QUICK THING, ONE QUICK THING. I KNOW WE'VE GOT A BIG SHOW TO DO TONIGHT, BUT ONE THING BEFORE WE GET STARTED, THERE WAS SOME BIG NEWS LAST WEEK THAT SLIPPED THROUGH MY NEWS CRACK, AND IT CONCERNS SOMEONE I'VE ADMIRED FOR YEARS, AND YET SURPRISINGLY IS NOT ME. I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID LETTERMAN, WHO LAST THURSDAY NIGHT ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT. AND I AM GOING TO MISS THIS GOOD MAN. DAVE HAS BEEN ON THE AIR MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE, "LATE NIGHT" DEBUTED MY FIRST YEAR IN COLLEGE. I LEARNED MORE FROM WATCHING DAVE THAN I DID FROM GOING TO MY CLASSES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ESPECIALLY-- ESPECIALLY THE ONES I DID NOT GO TO BECAUSE I HAD STAYED UP UNTIL 1:30 WATCHING DAVE.   ( APPLAUSE ) THIS MAN HAS INFLUENCED EVERY HOST WHO CAME AFTER HIM, AND EVEN A FEW WHO CAME BEFORE HIM. HE'S THAT GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I GOTTA TELL YOU, I DO NOT ENVY WHOEVER THEY TRY TO PUT IN THAT CHAIR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  FOLKS, FOLKS, THOSE ARE SOME HUGE SHOES TO FILL, AND SOME REALLY BIG PANTS. ( LAUGHTER ) NATION, WEDDING VOWS ARE SUPPOSED TO LAST TILL DEATH DO US PART, BUT WITH TODAY'S DIVORCE RATE, SADLY, HALF OF MARRIAGES DON'T END IN DEATH. THIS IS CHEATING DEATH WITH STEPHEN T. COLBERT, D.F.A.
YES, SIR, WHERE'S THE PRETTY LADY? ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  DEPRESSION EDITION. FIRST UP, FOLKS, A DISCLAIMER EYE AM NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR. I HAVE AN HONORARY DOCTORATE IN FINE ARTS SO I CAN'T CURE YOUR BLINDNESS, BUT I CAN OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE GRAND MINIMALISM OF RICHARD SERRA'S SCULPTURES. AS ALWAYS, CHEATING DEATH IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS. PRESCOTT:  WHERE MALPRACTICE MAKES MALPERFECT. ( APPLAUSE ) FIRST NEXT UP, MENTAL HEALTH. FOLKS, THIS COUNTRY HAS A SERIOUS DEPRESSION PROBLEM. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, NEARLY 20% OF AMERICANS REPORT AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF DEPRESSION IN THEIR LIFETIME. WHILE THE OTHER 80% INSIST THAT EVERYTHING IS OKAY. SHUT UP, DADDY'S DRINKING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) , AND, SURE, THERE ARE TREATMENTS LIKE PROZAC, PAXIL, AND ZOLOFT, BUT YOU CANNOT INJECT THEM INTO YOUR FACE.
BOTOX IS THE MOST POPULAR COSMETIC ENHANCEMENT PROCEDURE IN THE COUNTRY. A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS BOTOX COULD ALSO BE USEFUL FOR A TREATMENT OPTION FOR DEPRESSION. THE THINKING IS FROWNING SENDS NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL SIGNALS TO THE BRAIN SO INHIBITING THE ABILITY TO FROWN WOULD INHIBIT THE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS.
Stephen:  FOLKS, WHEN I LEARNED THAT BOTOX CAN CURE DEPRESSION, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE EXPRESSION ON MY FACE. OR ANY EXPRESSION ON THE FACE OF SOMEONE WITH BOTOX. CHEERING YOU UP BY KILLING YOUR FACE WORKS BECAUSE THERE IS A CIRCUIT BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND THE MUSCLES OF FACIAL EXPRESSION, IN WHICH THE BRAIN MONITORS THE EMOTIONAL VALENCE OF THE FACE AND RESPONDS BY GENERATING THE APPROPRIATE FEELING. WELL, OF COURSE, YOUR FACE TELLS YOUR BRAIN HOW IT FEEL. YOUR FACE-BRAIN IS MUCH SMARTER THAN YOUR SKULL-BRAIN AND YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE MY FACE JUST SAID IT. THIS PROCEDURE IS NOT ONLY EFFECTIVE, FOLKS. IT IS FAR LESS INVASIVE THAN THE PREVIOUS COSMETIC TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION-- RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY TO TURN THAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWN. THAT GUY LOOKS HAPPY. FOLKS, THERE'S ONLY ONE DOWNSIDE TO THIS MIRACULOUS CURE FOR DEPRESSION-- BOTOX CAN ALSO MAKE YOU FEEL DEPRESSED BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SMILE PROPERLY. WHICH THEN COULD MAKE YOU VERY SAD, BUT FORTUNATELY, YOU CAN ALSO NO LONGER FROWN. BUT PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS KNOWS THAT YOUR EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS GO WELL BEYOND JUST HAPPINESS AND DEPRESSION. THAT'S WHY PRESCOTT IS PROUD TO INTRODUCE VACSA-MEH. BECAUSE WHY PARALYZE YOUR FACE FROM SHOWING EMOTIONS WHEN YOU CAN PARALYZE THE EMOTIONS THEMSELVES? EVERY SYRINGE CONTAINS THE SAME TOXIN AS BOTOX, BUT WITH AN EIGHT-INCH NEEDLE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO INJECT IT DIRECTLY INTO YOUR BRAIN. WHEN YOU FEEL A TINGLING, THAT MEANS IT'S WORKING. WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL ANYTHING AT ALL, THAT MEANS IT WORKED. ( LAUGHTER ) SIDE EFFECTS OF VACSA-MEH INCLUDE SEARCH AND SEIZURES. MALE PATTERN BALDWIN, AND HIPSTER DYSPLASIA, AND VACSA-MEH IS 100% GUARANTEED TO WORK, AND WHEN IT DOESN'T, THERE'S ANOTHER SOLUTION IN-- MENTAL HEALTH. BECAUSE THERE IS YET ANOTHER CURE FOR DEPRESSION.
BATTLING LONG-TERM DEPRESSION, OXFORD UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS TREATED 38 PEOPLE WITH THE DRUG KETAMINE FOR MORE THAN THREE WEEKS. 30% SAW THEIR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS LESSEN. EIGHT PEOPLE REPORTED FEELING FREE OF DEPRESSION. KETAMINE IS ALSO USED AS A HORSE TRANQUILIZER ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  IT MAKES SENSE. FOLKS-- ( APPLAUSE ) IT DOES MAKE SENSE THAT YOU TREAT DEPRESSION WITH A HORSE TRANQUILIZER BECAUSE EVERY TIME I SEE A HORSE I SAY, "WHY THE LONG FACE?" ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S ON A SUICIDE WATCH. ( LAUGHTER ) LITTLE MEN IN SILK PAJAMAS GET ON HIS BACK AND MAKE HIM JUMP OVER STICKING WHILE WHIPPING HIM. IT'S SAD. AND THIS VETERINARY DRUG ISN'T JUST USED TO ANIMALS, FOLKS. IT'S ALSO USED ON PARTY ANIMALS.
KETAMINE IS A GENERAL ANESTHETIC OFTEN USED BY VETERINARIANS. WHEN TAPE IN HIGH DOSES AT THE CLUB SCENE, USERS SAY THEY FEEL DETACHED AND ALMOST HALLUCINATE.
KETAMINE IS ALSO USED AT THE DRUG SCENE AS A PARTY DRUG. WE HAVE SOME FOOT  OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS. THAT THAT-- THAT WAS THE CONTROL GROUP. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, ACCORDING TO THE STUDY, KETAMINE TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF THE NEUROTRANSMITTER GLUTAMATE IN THE BRAIN, WHICH STIMULATES THE GROWTH OF SYNAPSES THAT HAVE BEEN DAMAGED BY STRESS. PUT IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, OXFORD UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS HAVE DETERMINED THAT DRUGS MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD SO YOU SHOULD TAKE THEM, WHICH IS WHY PRESCOTT HAS REPURPOSED ITS OWN LIQUID ANTIDEPRESSION PARTY  MEDICATION-- VAC DANIELS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ( APPLAUSE ) VAC-DANIELS COMES IN THIS PATENTED MEDI BOTTLE, AND IS GUARANTEED TO TEMPORARILY RELIEVE DEPRESSION, REDUCE SOCIAL ANXIETY, AND MAKE YOU FUNNY, BRAVE, AND SEXY, PLUS IT MAKES OTHER PEOPLE SEEM MORE ATTRACTIVE. ( LAUGHTER ) SIMPLY ADMINISTER VAC-DANIELS USING THE CUSTOMIZED BIOINDEX. HOLD UP TWO FINGERS TO THE GLASS TO FIND YOUR PROPER DOSAGE. ( APPLAUSE ) FOR SEVERE CASES, DRINK MORE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CONTINUE TREATMENT WITH VAC-DANIELS UNTIL THE SOURCE OF YOUR STRESS GOES AWAY. WHETHER IT BE DEPRESSION, YOUR JOB, OR YOUR FAMILY. ( LAUGHTER ) SIDE EFFECTS OF VAC-DANIELS INCLUDE HIGH BALLS, BUD LIGHT LIME DISEASE, AND DEPRESSION. WELL, BROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS. PRESCOTT-- IF IT WALKS LIKE A DUCK AND TALKS LIKE A DUCK THERE'S BEEN A BREACH FROM THE DUCK CONTAINMENT FACILITY. APPROACH WITH CAUTION. THEY HAVE PIRAHNA TEETH.  UNTIL NEXT TIME, I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL
