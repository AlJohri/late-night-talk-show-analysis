STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS HERE TO DISCUSS THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBERAL MAGAZINE "THE NEW REPUBLIC." THIS MONTH'S CENTER FOLD, F.D.R. AGAIN. PLEASE WELCOME LEON WIESELTIER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
MY PLEASURE.
STEPHEN: FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT KNOW, YOU ARE A WRITER, CRITIC, PHILOSOPHER AND LONG TIME EDITOR OF "THE NEW REPUBLIC." THERE'S YOUR LIBERAL RAG. THE MAGAZINE CELEBRATES ITS HUNDREDTH  ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR, AND  HAS RELEASED A NEW BOOK CALLED INSURRECTIONS OF THE MIND,  100 YEARS OF POLITICS AND CULTURE IN AMERICA. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A CULTURAL CRITIC? DO YOU HAVE A CRITIQUE OF OUR PRESENT CULTURE?
OH, I DO, YES. I DO. IT'S A VERY ELABORATE ONE. YES. SO --
STEPHEN: TEN WORDS OR LESS. TEN WORDS OR LESS -- TOO MUCH DIGITAL, NOT ENOUGH CRITICAL THINKING, MORE PHYSICAL REALITY.
STEPHEN: THAT'S TEN, DAMN! NO ONE'S EVER DONE THAT BEFORE.
STEPHEN: THAT'S TEN, DAMN! NO ONE'S EVER DONE THAT BEFORE. SO YOU'RE ONE OF THEM LITERARY TYPES.
MM-HMM (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: THE MAGAZINE WAS FOUNDED 100 YEARS AGO. THAT'S THE BEGINNING TO HAVE THE PROGRESSIVE ERA IN THE U.S.
IT WAS.
STEPHEN: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PROGRESSIVE AND WHAT WE THINK OF AS A LIBERAL TODAY.
SOMETIMES THEY GET CONFUSED AND LUMPED TOGETHER. THE PROGRESSIVES ARE MORE TO THE LEFT OF US.
STEPHEN: OF YOU? TO THE LEFT OF YOUR HAIR?
ACTUALLY, WAY TO THE LEFT. THIS IS CENTRIST HAIR. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: WHO ARE SOME OF THE GREAT MINDS WHO HAVE INSURRECTIONS OF THE MIND?
JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES, ORSON WELLS.
STEPHEN: KEYNES ECONOMICS -- I PAY YOU TO DIG A HOLE, TOMORROW I PAY YOU TO FILL IT IN, THAT CAT?
APPROXIMATELY.
STEPHEN: CLOSE ENOUGH FOR MY SHOW.
ALL RIGHT THEN
STEPHEN: IT SEEMS LIKE THE PEOPLE OF THE NEW REPUBLIC  ARE FOLKS WHO BELIEVE IN THINKING, OKAY.
WE DO. IT'S PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS, I KNOW.
STEPHEN: IT IS. (LAUGHTER) NOT VERY POPULAR THESE DAYS. SELL ME ON THINKING. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO THINK MUCH ANYMORE. I CAN JUST FEEL, AND I CAN ALSO OPEN ANY EYES AND TAKE THE DIGITAL FIRE HOSE FROM MY SCREEN AND WATCH VIDEOS AND PICTURES OF, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE'S PIE--
AND MISTAKE THAT FOR THINKING.
STEPHEN: NOT MISTAKING IT FOR THINKING, I'M PREFERRING IT. I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD, BUT HERE'S THE REASON, A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, AN OPEN SOCIETY PLACES AN EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECTUAL RESPONSIBILITY ON ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN BECAUSE WE ARE GOVERNED BY WHAT WE THINK, WE ARE GOVERNED BY OUR OPINIONS, SO THE CONTENT AND THE QUALITY OF OUR OPINIONS AND THE QUALITY OF THE FORMATION OF OUR OPINIONS IS WHAT BASICALLY DETERMINES THE CHARACTER OF OUR SOCIETY AND THAT MEANS IN A DEMOCRACY IN AN OPEN SOCIETY, A THOUGHTLESS CITIZEN OF A DEMOCRACY IS A DELINQUENT CITIZEN OF A DEMOCRACY. (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: I THOUGHT YOU WERE STILL FILIBUSTERING. I'M SORRY.
NO.
STEPHEN: WHAT ABOUT FEELING?
HUMAN LIFE WILL NEVER SUFFER FROM TOO LITTLE FEELING. WE ALL FEEL ALL THE TIME. WE'RE MORTAL CREATURES. WE HAVE HEARTS.
STEPHEN: YES. THE IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO MISTAKE OUR HEARTS FOR OUR MINDS. THEY DO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. IF WE WERE ONLY HEARTS OR MINDS WE WOULD BE MONSTERS, BUT WE'RE BOTH. SO THE ROLE OF THE MIND IS TO ACTUALLY QUESTION SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS AND DOGMAS AND PREJUDICES OF THE HEART.
STEPHEN: BUT THERE'S A THIRD ORGAN YOU'RE LEAVING OUT
I BET THERE IS.
STEPHEN: WELL, THERE'S A FOURTH. THANK YOU FOR RAISING THE LEVEL OF THE CONVERSATION.
STEPHEN: THERE'S YOUR GUT, THERE'S YOUR GUT THERE'S THE MIND, SAYING WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT! THEN YOUR HEART, OH, THIS IS HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE THINGS YOU'RE  DOING. AND THEN THERE'S MY GUT THAT TELLS ME THIS IS RIGHT.
RIGHT.
STEPHEN: I GO WITH MY GUT BECAUSE MY GUT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS THAT REQUIRE COURAGE, WHICH ARE MY BALLS.
RIGHT. I SEE. ALL RIGHT. I SEE.
STEPHEN: MY GUT AND MY BALLS -- (LAUGHTER) MY GUT AND MY BALLS ARE FIGHTING MY BRAIN AND MY HEART.
IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL. WE'VE JUST MET SO I'M NOT GOING TO DISCUSS SOME OF. THIS I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE GUT BUT A GUT REQUIRES EDUCATION. I BELIEVE IN EDUCATED GUTS. THE IMPORTANT THING IS WE HAVE REASON FOR OUR BELIEFS AND THEN WE ARTICULATE AND THEN DEFEND THE REASONS.
STEPHEN: HERE'S A REASON FOR MY BELIEFS.
ALL RIGHT.
STEPHEN: THEY FEEL GOOD. (LAUGHTER) IT FEELS GOOD TO THINK THAT WHEN I DIE I WILL GO TO HEAVEN. THAT FEELS GOOD. IT FEELS GOOD TO THINK THAT I AM RIGHT. THAT FEELS GOOD.
WELL, YOU KNOW THAT IT'S PREPOSTEROUS TO THINK THAT BECAUSE ONE FEELS SOMETHING THAT IT'S THE TRUTH.
STEPHEN: NO, IT'S NOT TRUE. IT'S TRUTHY. WHICH IS GREATER THAN TRUTH. IT IS INASSAILABLE BECAUSE MY TRUTH IS BASED UPON WHAT I WANT TO BE TRUE --
RIGHT.
STEPHEN: -- RATHER THAN ANYTHING THE FACTS COULD POSSIBLY SUPPORT. YOUR TRUTH REQUIRES WORK, MINE REQUIRES MERELY A DECISION. I'LL BEAT YOU TO THE TRUTH PUNCH ALL THE TIME.
I CONGRATULATE YOU ON LIVING IN A WORLD ENTIRELY YOUR OWN.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU. IT'S CALLED THE COLBERT NATION! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE NEW REPUBLIC INSURRECTIONS OF THE MIND! GET IT ALL! THANK YOU SO MUCH!
