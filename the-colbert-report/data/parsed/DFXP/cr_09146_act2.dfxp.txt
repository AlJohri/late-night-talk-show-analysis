STEPHEN COLBERT PRESENTS, THE C-OLBERT BOOK CLUB, TONIGHT'S SELECTION.
EVERYTHING BUT CATCHER IN THE RYE, BY J.D. SALINGER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THE C-OLBERT BOOK CLUB!  THANKS SO MUCH!  J.D. SALINGER, OF COURSE, IS BEST KNOWN FOR CATCHER IN THE RYE, CONSIDERED PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT AMERICAN NOVEL THAT I DON'T GET. NO SMALL ACHIEVEMENT CONSIDERING THE THOUSANDS OF OTHER NOVELS I DON'T GET. I MEAN, GOOD NIGHT MOON, IT MAKES NO SENSE. THE MOON STAYS UP AT NIGHT. IT SHOULD BE GOOD NIGHT, SUN, HELLO MOON, HAVE A GREAT EVENING. NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: FOLKS, DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE J.D. SALINGER'S SHORT STORIES ABOUT THE BRILLIANT EMOTIONALLY FRAGILE GLASS FAMILY, THERE IS JUST SOMETHING HABIT THE SELF-ABSORBED ANXIETIES OF EMOTIONALLY STUNTED RICH WHITE PEOPLE THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO ME. THE POINT IS, I DON'T CARE IF MILLIONS CONSIDER CATCHER IN THE RYE J.D. SALINGER'S BEST WORK, YOU WILL NEVER CONVINCE ME, HERE TO CONVINCE ME IS THE AUTHOR OF "THIS BOY'S LIFE", PLEASE WELCOME TOBIAS WOLFF. TO BIAS, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
OKAY.
I'M SORRY. CAN I -- WAS --
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.
Stephen: MORE FOR DADDY. ALL RIGHT. I HAVE TO STAY HYDRATED. NOW, TO BE BIAS, YOU BELIEVE.
TOBIAS, YOU BELIEVE THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT AMERICAN FORMS, TRUE.
I THINK IT IS A WONDERFUL NOVEL.
Stephen: DID IT INFLUENCE YOUR WORK.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: BECAUSE "THIS BOY'S LIFE" IS A COMING OF AGE STORY IN WHICH YOU START OFF AS YOURSELF AS YOU END UP AS LEONARDO DICAPRIO.
WHY DO YOU -- WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS A GREAT NOVEL AND WHY DO YOU THINK IT TALKS TO OUR KIDS?
WELL, I WOULD SAY TO BEGIN WITH THAT I WISH IT WEREN'T TAUGHT TO THE KIDS, BECAUSE --
Stephen: AMEN.
PART OF THE EXPERIENCE OF FINDING THAT NOVEL FOR MYSELF WAS THAT I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING SUBVERSIVE WHEN I WAS READING IT, BECAUSE HERE IS A BOOK THAT WAS REALLY CALLING THE ADULT WORLD AS I SAW IT THEN, A NEST OF HYPOCRISY, AND PHONINESS, AND THAT IS SOMETHING YOU WANT TO DISCOVER ON YOUR OWN. YOU DON'T WANT YOUR ENGLISH TEACHER TO BE INTRODUCING YOU TO THE HYPOCRISY OF ADULTS. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I STILL REMEMBER THE NIGHT I READ IT. I WAS IN A PLAY, AND I KEPT MISSING MY -- BECAUSE I WAS READING THIS BOOK AND LAUGHING SO HARD, SO IN HIS THRALL AND I THINK WHEN YOU DISCOVER THE BOOK IN THAT WAY, IT STAYS WITH YOU IN THAT WAY THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. YOU READ IT LATER, RIGHT?
Stephen: I DIDN'T READ IT. IT WAS ASSIGNED IN TENTH GRADE, AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK I GET HOLDEN CAULFIELD BECAUSE I SAID I AM NOT GOING TO READ THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: I AM MORE HOLDEN CAULFIELD THAT HOLDEN CAULFIELD, REALLY.
YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOU REALLY THINK WE SHOULD TEACH THIS STUFF TO THE KIDS?  BECAUSE IT HAD BAD WORDS IN IT AND IT HAS A PROSTITUTE IN IT AND THAT IS SOME SPICY STUFF.  DO WE NEED TO BE REINFORCING OUR KIDS BAD BEHAVIOR AS TEENAGERS WITH THE IDEA THEY COULD BE A CHARACTER IN A GREAT NOVEL?  DAD, I WASN'T DISOBEYING YOU, I WAS EXPLORING MODES OF ALIENATION.
WELL, I WOULD CERTAINLY WANT THEM TO BE INTRODUCED TO THAT BOOK RATHER THAN BE TRAINED IN POMPOUSNESS, PRETENTIOUSNESS, BOGUS SPIRITUALITY, SUCH AS YOU FIND IN THE CLASS STORIES.
Stephen: NOW, WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND. THE GLASS FAMILY STORIES, FRANNY AND ZOOEY, AND THE CARPENTERS, EVEN DOWN AT THE DINGY IF YOU WANT TO.
THOSE ARE --
Stephen: THOSE ARE SOME OF HIS FINEST WORKS, SOME OF HIS GREATEST WORKS. YOU WILL ADMIT THAT OR YOU WILL PAY A PRICE.
WELL, IF YOU LIKE --
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST THE GLASS FAMILY?
DO YOU LIKE TO READ SERMONS ALL DAY?
Stephen: I GIVE THEM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THERE IS A WONDERFUL LITTLE MOMENT IN CATCHER IN THE RYE WHEN HOLDEN IS TALKING ABOUT THE PREACHERS THAT COME TO TALK IN THE CHAPEL AND -- AT -- AND HE TALKS ABOUT THIS HOLY JOE TONE THAT THEY TAKE ON, AND ODDLY ENOUGH THAT IS THE TONE HE TOOK ON WHEN HE WAS WRITING THESE GLASS FAMILY STORIES.
Stephen: BUDDY GLASS WHO WRITES ALL OF THE STORIES, IT EVEN IMPLIES HE WROTE CATCHER IN THE RYE, EVERYTHING.
EVERYTHING, RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY. HE SAYS ESSENTIALLY I KNOW THAT I AM WRITING IMPERFECT STORIES HERE AND I WILL BE GET LOST IN MY OWN LO CONSTITUTIONS AND I USE GOD IN A WAY THAT IS NOT A THREE LETTER EXPLETIVE AND ACTUALLY THINK OF HIM AS SERMONIZING. HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING BUT IT IS A CONFESSION. YOU ARE SEEING WHO SALINGER REALLY IS, YOU DON'T LIKE SALINGER, HOW DARE YOU LIKE HIS BOOK. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: TOBIAS WOLFF. "THIS BOY'S LIFE" IS ALSO PRETTY GOOD. WE WILL BE R
