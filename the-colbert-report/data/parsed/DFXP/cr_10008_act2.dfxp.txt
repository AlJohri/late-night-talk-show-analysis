Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, IF YOU ARE A LOYAL VIEWER OF THE THE "COLBERT REPORT," YOU KNOW I CALLED OUT A STREET ARTIST. THIS VANDAL IS SPENDING OCTOBER TURNING WALLS IN NEW YORK CITY INTO PRICELESS WORKS OF ART. I DO NOT WANT TO ENCOURAGE THIS TEMPORARY ARTFUL DODGER BECAUSE HIS GLORIFICATION OF GRAFFITI COULD LEAD OUR KIDS DOWN THE WRONG PATH, TO A LIFE OF CRIME-- OR WOARTS, OUR SCOOZ. THIS PAST MOND I SPECIFICALLY FORBADE HIM FROM PAINTING ON THE WALL OF MY STUDIO, AND, THEREFORE, TRANSFORMING IT INTO A MILLION-DOLLAR WORK OF ART. IMAGINE MY SURPRISE THIS MORNING WHEN I DISCOVERED THIS INCREDIBLE WORK OF ART ON MY STUDIO WALL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW WHO IS MORE IMPRESSIVE-- HOW HE CAPTURED MY LIKENESS OR HOW HE KNEW WHAT I LOOK LIKE BEFORE I BODY WAX. NOW, AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WAS BANKSY. BUT IT TURNS OUT THE WORK WAS SIGNED BY HANKSY, WHO EVIDENTLY IS A WELL-KNOWN STREET ARTIST WHOSE WORK USES CELEBRITY ICONOGRAPHY TO ADDRESS THE EFESMERAL NATURE OF FAME PARTICULARLY WITH TERRIBLE PUNS. HIS OTHER WORKS INCLUDE HEMUEL L.PD JACKSON, AND METH ROGAN. POWERFUL STUFF. REALLY MAKES YOU NOT THINK. HERE I ASSUME I AM STEPHEN COL-GRIZZRY OFLY. BUT LIKE BANKSY, HAIRCHGZY'S IDENTITY IS A MYSTERY. WHO CULD HE? HANKSY'S FIRST STREET ART FEATURED TOM HANKS WHO HAPPENED TO BE MY GUEST LAST NIGHT, AND THAT'S WHEN THE LIGHT BULB WENT OFF. HANKSEE, SOUNDS LIKE YANGTZE. THERE ARE THREE GORGEOUS MEMBERS OF ONE DIRECTION, THE OTHER TWO ARE... ONE DIRECTION IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING ONE WAY AND MY CONSTITUTE STOOUDIO IS ON A ONE-WAY STREET WHERE HANKSY PUT HIS ART. IT'S ALL A CRYPTIC CODE LIKE THE DA VINCI CODE STARRING TOM HANKS. TOM HAIRCHGZ MUST BE HANKSY. AND I GOTTA SAY. YOU SEE, YOU SEE. CLICK, CLICK, CLICK. I GOTTA SAY I'M A LITTLE UPSET THAT HE USED THE SPRAY PAINT I LEFT IN HIS DRESSING ROOM. I TOLD YOU, TOM, THAT SPRAY PAINT WAS FOR HUFFING ONLY. PAIL GIAMATTI UNDERSTOOD THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I'M SORRY, BANKSY, BUT IT IS TOO LATE FOR YOU TO PUT ONE OF YOUR HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER MASTERPIECES ON MY WALL BECAUSE THERE'S STILL ONLY LOTS OF ROOM LEFT. BY THE WAY, NEXT WEEK WE'RE ON VACATION, SO I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHEN YOU DID IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
