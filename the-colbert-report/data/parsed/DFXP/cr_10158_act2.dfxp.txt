(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, AS AN AMERICAN, I ENJOY TO EAT FOOD. ESPECIALLY WITH THIS HOLE. BUT SOMETIMES IT GETS CLOGGED UP WITH ALL THE FOOD. EVEN IF I'VE CHEWED IT FIRST. SO TO WASH IT DOWN, I ALWAYS REACH FOR THE QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN BEER, PABST BLUE RIBBON. (APPLAUSE) SO NAMED BECAUSE IT WAS JUDGED AMERICA'S BEST AS RECENTLY AS THE CHICAGO WORLD'S FAIR OF 1893. (LAUGHTER) WHERE I BELIEVE IT BEAT OUT JEBEDIAH VAN KRAUTMAN'S WORMWOOD CHOLERA TONIC. AND PABST ALWAYS HAD THE BEST COMMERCIALS.
HEINEKEN! PABST BLUE RIBBON!
STEPHEN: THEY JUST DON'T WRITE JINGLES LIKE THAT ANYMORE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, PABST "IS" AMERICA. THAT'S WHY, WHEN I HEARD THIS, I EXPLODED LIKE A CAN OF P.B.R. IN THE GLOVEBOX.
A BOMBSHELL IN THE BEER COMMUNITY TODAY. P.B.R. IS GOING TO THE FORMER U.S.S.R. P.B.R. WAS ALWAYS A GOOD ROCK-RIBBED AMERICAN BLUE-COLLAR BRAND THAT ENJOYED A SECOND WIND, THANKS TO THE EMBRACE OF HIPSTERS. PABST AND SISTER BRANDS COLT 45 AND OLD MILWAUKEE ARE ALL BEING SOLD TO A LARGE RUSSIAN BREWING COMPANY CALLED OASIS BEVERAGES.
STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT. THE DAMN RUSSKIES ARE BUYING P.B.R.! (AUDIENCE BOOING) HOW WOULD "THEY" LIKE IT IF WE BOUGHT THEIR KRAFT RUSSIAN DRESSING? (LAUGHTER) AND I DON'T BUY OASIS BEVERAGE'S CLAIM THAT "THERE ARE DEFINITELY NO PLANS TO CHANGE ANY OF THE RECIPES." DO YOU REALLY EXPECT US TO BELIEVE PABST HAS A RECIPE? (LAUGHTER) EVERYONE KNOWS THEY JUST CATCH WHAT THEY CAN SQUEEGEE FROM THE SIDE OF A BUDWEISER CLYDESDALE. (LAUGHTER) WORSE, THE RUSSIANS AREN'T GETTING ONLY PABST. THE SALE INCLUDES OLD MILWAUKEE, SCHLITZ AND COLT 45. THAT'S RIGHT. "ALL" THE BEER LEFT IN YOUR FRIDGE AFTER A PARTY IN 1975. (APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, IT'S P.B.R., THAT REALLY HURTS. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE CLASSIC AMERICAN BEER ENJOYED BY YOUR GRANDFATHER. THANKS TO THE HIPSTER REVIVAL, IT'S THE CLASSIC AMERICAN BEER ENJOYED BY YOUNG PEOPLE TRYING TO LOOK LIKE YOUR GRANDFATHER. WHICH MEANS THEY'RE NOT JUST TAKING AN AMERICAN ICON, THEY'RE TAKING AMERICAN IRONY. (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT SURPRISED. THEY'VE BEEN GROWING RIDICULOUS HIPSTER BEARDS SINCE RASPUTIN. (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT GUY DOESN'T MAKE HIS OWN PICKLES? COME ON! ALL RIGHT. TO THE BARRICADES! DEFEND OUR P.B.R.! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW, MAYBE I OVERREACTED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
