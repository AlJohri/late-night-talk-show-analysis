[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PULITZER  PRIZE-WINNING ENVIRONMENTAL  JOURNALIST. TO PICK HIM UP TONIGHT I SENT A  FLAMING LIMOSINE. PLEASE WELCOME DAVID SASSOON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, MR. SASSOON, GOOD TO SEE  YOU. THANKS FOR COMING ON. YOU ARE THE FOUNDER AND  PUBLISHER OF SOMETHING CALLED  INSIDE CLIMATE NEWS. THREE OF YOUR REPORTERS WON THE  PULITZER PRIZE THIS YEAR. THOSE STORIES HAVE BEEN  COLLECTED INTO AN E-BOOK CALLED  "INSIDE THE BIGGEST OIL SPIFF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF."
THAT'S CORRECT  Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, WHAT  IS INSIDE CLIMATE NEWS?
INSIDE CLIMATE NEWS IS A FACE  OF THE NEW JOURNALISM. WE ARE AN ON-LINE PUBLICATION. WE COVER ENERGY AND CLIMATE NEWS  AND FILL THE GAPS THAT  MAINSTREAM JOURNALISM IS LEAVING UNCOVERED
Stephen: YOU'RE THE FACE OF  THE NEW JOURNALISM OUT THERE. DO YOU GUYS HAVE A SCANDAL  BOOTH?
WE DON'T  Stephen: EVERYONE IS GOING TO  DO THAT. FROM NOW ON, EVERYONE WILL HAVE  A SCANDAL BOOTH. WHY ARE YOU COVERING  ENVIRONMENTAL STORIES? BECAUSE A LOT OF NEWS  ORGANIZATIONS ARE CLOSING THEIR  ENVIRONMENTAL DESKS. "NEW YORK TIMES" CLOSED THEIR  ENVIRONMENTAL DESK LAST YEAR. THAT'S ALL THE NEWS THAT IS IS  FIT TO PRINT. DOESN'T THAT PROVE THAT YOUR  ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS IS NOT FIT TO  PRINT?
NO. Stephen: OR BLOG OR WHATEVER  YOU KIDS CALL IT.
THEY MADE AN ERROR IN CLOSING  DOWN THEIR ENVIRONMENT DESK AND  GETTING RID OF THEIR TWO ENVIRONMENT EDITORS
Stephen: YOU'RE MORE LEFTY  THAN THE "NEW YORK TIMES."  THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE TO  ME.
NOT AT ALL  Stephen: YES YOU ARE. THE ENVIRONMENT WRAPS  EVERYBODY TOGETHER IN ONE
Stephen: IT MAY, BUT TALKING  ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT IS LEFTY.
NO, NOT AT ALL  Stephen: IT IS TOTALLY LEFT. THE FAR RIGHT FRINGE TALKS ABOUT  CLIMATE INCESSANTLY.
Stephen: WHY? BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SAY IT'S  NOT HAPPENING
Stephen: IT'S NOT THOUGH. IT IS  Stephen: THE CLIMATE ISN'T  HAPPENING. WE'RE IN THE CLIMATE. IT'S NOT HAPPENING. SEE THIS AIR. SEE THIS STUFF BETWEEN US. THAT'S CLIMATE. NOTHING HAPPENING.
RIGHT  Stephen: THAT'S THE  ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS OUR ENVIRONMENT. CAN'T SEE IT.
WE IN THE BUSINESS DON'T SAY  CLIMATE CHANGE. WE JUST SAY CLIMATE. I MEANT TO SAY CLIMATE CHANGE IS  HAPPENING
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT  PIPELINE SECURITY. YOU GUYS WON THIS THING BECAUSE  OF SOMETHING CALLED THE DILBIT  DISASTER. IT HAPPENED IN KALAMAZOO  MICHIGAN.
THAT'S RIGHT. ONE MILLION GALLONS OF  DILUTEDDED BUY DUE MEAN THAT  COMES FROM THE TAR SANDS OF  ALBERTA. IT STARTS OUT ALMOST MIKE PEANUT  BUTTER. THEY DILUTE IT
Stephen: WITH WHAT? JELLY?
THAT'S GOOD. IT MIGHT BE BETTER.
Stephen: THIS IS STUFF THAT'S  STILL IN ARKANSAS.
THAT'S RIGHT. IN ARKANSAS TOO.
Stephen: I HEARD ABOUT THE  ARKANSAS STORY A LOT. HOW COME I DIDN'T HEAR MORE  ABOUT THIS KALAMAZOO?
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED RIGHT  AFTER THE BIG B.P. OIL SPILL IN  THE GULF. NOBODY WAS PAYING ATTENTION. EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE  CLEANED UP IN A HURRY. GUESS WHAT. IT'S NOT CLEANED UP YET. THREE YEARS LATER. THE REASON IS THE PEANUT BUTTER  AND THE DILUTED STUFF, THEY MAKE  IT FLOW THROUGH PIPELINES WITH, OKAY, WHEN THE PIPELINE  RUPTURED, THE DILUTED STUFF  EVAPORATED AND THE PEANUT BUTTER SANK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER
Stephen: SO IT'S GONE. NO. Stephen: I CAN'T SEE IT. I CAN'T SEE IT. OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND. YOU'VE HEARD OF THAT.
YOU CAN SWIM IN IT  Stephen: I DON'T SWIM IN  KALAMAZOO.
YOU CAN EAT THE FISH THAT  COMES OUT OF IT
Stephen: DON'T EAT FISH IN  KALAMAZOO.
IT'S A PROBLEM  Stephen: I'M SURE IT'S A  PROBLEM BUT WHY DO WE HAVE TO  TALK ABOUT IT? IF WE IGNORE THE ENVIRONMENT  WON'T IT JUST GO AWAY?
NO, IT WILL HIT YOU UP SIDE  THE HEAD
Stephen: GOOD LUCK BEING THE  NEW VOICE OF JOURNALISM FOR THE  WORLD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DAVID SASSOON. INSIDE CLIMATE NEWS DOT-ORG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
