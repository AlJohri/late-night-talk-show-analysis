Stephen: TONIGHT, A NEW SOLUTION FOR VOTER APATHY-- GET READY FOR STRIPPER POLLING STATIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN HOW CAN YOU TELL IF SOMEONE IS AMERICAN? IF YOU'RE OVERSEAS, LOOK FOR THE CANADIAN FLAG ON THEIR BACKPACK. AND MY GUEST, DAVID MILIBAND, HAS JUST RETURNED FROM SUPERVISING THE RESPONSE TO EBOLA IN AFRICA. SO REMEMBER, AUDIENCE, DO NOT LICK THE GUEST. ( LAUGHTER ) U. PENN IS OFFERING A CLASS IN WASTING TIME ON THE INTERNET. OH! I HOPE THEY OFFER IT ONLINE. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOOO! WHOOO! WHOOO! WHOOO! ( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!" )
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD! HOW YOU DOING, EVERYBODY? WHOOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO THE REPORT. NATION, NATION, I AM SO GLAD, I AM SO GLAD YOU ARE HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE THE WORLD IS SWEPT UP IN THE GRIPPING NEWS STORY ABOUT THE THREAT OF EBOLA. BUT I TALKED ABOUT THAT ON MONDAY, SO I'VE DONE MY PART. LET'S MOVE ON. ( LAUGHTER ) TO A MUCH BIGGER STORY-- ME. YOU SEE-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, THIS PAST TUESDAY, MY BOOK "AMERICA AGAIN: RE-BECOMING THE GREATNESS WE NEVER WEREN'T," WAS RELEASED IN PAPERBACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF YOU DID NOT GET THIS BOOK BEFORE, GET IT NOW. AND IF YOU DID GET IT BEFORE, GET IT NOW. BECAUSE THIS BOOK IS PERFECT FOR LONGTIME FANS, OR FIRST-TIME VIEWERS WHO ARE WONDERING, "WHO IS THIS COLBERT GUY?" ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED IN HERE, STARTING WITH, "HAS HE WRITTEN A BOOK?" YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY IT TO FIND OUT. OF COURSE, FOR THE MILLIONS OF YOU WHO ALREADY OWN A HARDCOVER COVER OF "AMERICA AGAIN," YOU SHOULD STILL BUY THE PAPERBACK VERSION BECAUSE IT MAKES A WONDERFUL BOOKMARK. ( APPLAUSE ) AND, FOLKS, THERE IS AN EVEN--   ( CHEERS ) THERE'S AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT REASON FOR YOU TO BUY MY BOOK-- BECAUSE ON DECEMBER 18, MY SHOW IS ENDING.
Audience: NO!
Stephen: I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT, FOLKS, FOLKS, AFTER NINE YEARS, I AM TAKING A WELL-EARNED VACATION. THOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHERE YET. I'LL HAVE TO TALK TO MY TRAVEL AGENT. WHERE AM I GOING, GRIMMY? ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, FIRE. SO SOME PLACE WARM? ( LAUGHTER ) SOME PLACE WARM WITH GOAT HORNS. GREECE! OPA! ( APPLAUSE ) THANKS, BUDDY. THERE ARE SO FEW GOOD TRAVEL AGENTS LEFT. THE POINT IS, STEPHEN COLBERT, THE GUY YOU'VE SEEN HERE EVERY NIGHT FOR NINE YEARS, WILL BE GONE. AND ALL YOU'LL HAVE LEFT-- ALL YOU'D HAVE LEFT OF ME IS THIS BOOK. SO PICK UP "AMERICA AGAIN" IN PAPERBACK FOR A LOVED ONE, OR FOR A HATED ONE. GO TO YOUR LOCAL INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORE, BECAUSE I HAVE A LONGTIME WAR AGAINST AMAZON, AND I WILL NEVER RELENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OR, OR, BUY IT ON AMAZON BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, JUST BUY IT. NATION, THE MIDTERMS ARE LESS THAN JUST UNDER A WEEK AWAY, AND LIKE ME, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED ABOUT THIS ELECTION.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT MIDTERMS.
MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF VOTERS WILL STAY HOME ON THIS ELECTION DAY.
EVEN ANECDOTALLY, PEOPLE WHO WERE LIFELONG, VERY INVOLVED IN POLITICS THIS YEAR, ARE JUST LIKE, "I'M OVER IT."
DOES ANYBODY CARE?
NOT REALLY. JUST 15% SAY THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE MIDDERM ELECTIONS.
THE MIDTERMS-- THEY'RE COMING UP. YOU KNOW, THE MIDTERMS. I CAN SEE YOU YAWNING.
Stephen: I WASN'T YAWNING. I WAS SAYING YAAAAY FOR THE MIDTERMS. ALL THAT INDIFFERENCE HASN'T COME CHEAP BECAUSE 2014 WILL BE THE MOST MIDTERMS EXPENSIVE EVER, COSTING $4 BILLION, AND NOBODY IS WATCHING. IT'S LIKE THE LONE RANGER OF ELECTIONS. I THINK I HAVE FOUND THE WAY, THE PERFECT WAY TO REINVIGORATE OUR ELECTION PROCESS. LAST NIGHT, I WAS UP WATCHING CNN-- I RAN OUT OF AMBIEN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND AFTER WATCHING THEM YAMMER ON ABOUT HOW NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE MIDTERMS, I FLIPPED OVER TO A RERUN OF "STAR TREK," A CLASSIC EPISODE CALLED "A TASTE OF ARMAGEDDON." EPISODE 23, SEASON 1.   ( CHEERS ) YEAH, OH, YEAH. THE GOOD OLD DAYS, BACK BEFORE KIRK'S MISSION WAS TO TRAVEL UNIVERSE NEGOTIATING CHEAP AIRLINE TICKETS. NOW, HUGE "STAR TREK" FANS LIKE ME, OR AS WE CALL OURSELVES, "STARRIES," KNOW THAT IN THIS EPISODE THE ENTERPRISE IS SENT TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH EMINAR VII, A SOCIETY THAT HAS DEEMED CONVENTIONAL WARFARE TOO DESTRUCTIVE AND CONVENTIONAL HATS TOO NOT-POINTY. INSTEAD THEY HAVE A COMPUTER SIMULATE WAR AND THEN CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF DEAD. CITIZENS REPORTED AS KILLED MUST SUBMIT THEMSELVES FOR TERMINATION BY WALKING INTO A DISINTEGRATION BOOTH. IN THE END, KIRK CONVINCES THESE SOCIETIES TO LIVE IN PEACE ALL FOR THE NOBLE PURPOSE OF BONING AN ALIEN. THIS EPISODE, THIS EPISODE ABOUT TWO BITTERLY OPPOSED FACTIONS DETERMINED TO DESTROY THE OTHER REMINDED ME OF THE MIDTERMS. THINK OF PARALLELS-- NOBODY WANT THEMSELVES TO HAPPEN. THEY'RE COSTING A TON OF MONEY, AND I'M PRETTY SURE LOUIE GOHMERT IS FERENGI. I'D SAY-- FOLKS, SAY INSTEAD OF THE DESTRUCTIVE MESS OF AN ELECTION, LET'S HAVE COMPUTERS SIMULATE ALL OUR ELECTIONS FROM NOW ON, AND SELECT THE WINNERS. NOW, I'M SURE MANY OF YOU ARE SAYING STEPHEN THAT SOUNDS GREAT, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE $4 BILLION? DON'T WORRY. WE'LL STILL PISS THAT STUFF AWAY. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE EVERY ELECTION CYCLE, THE COMPUTERS WILL ORDER HUGE PILES OF MONEY TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE DISINTEGRATION MACHINE. IT WILL SAVE TIME. YOU WON'T HAVE TO WATCH ANY CAMPAIGN ADS OR PAY ATTENTION TO THE POLITICS. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT CHUCK TODD WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO HIS PREVIOUS JOB AS PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, FOLKS, I HAVE TAKEN-- I HAVE TAKEN THE INITIATIVE OF BUILDING MY OWN MACHINE-- BEHOLD, THE DISINTEPORTER 6700. THE MACHINE IS LOADED WITH A PILE OF $100 BILLS, AND I, I WILL NOW DISINTEPORTER THE MONEY. WHICH MEANS YOU WILL EITHER DISINTEGRATE OR TELEPORT SOME PLACE ELSE. I'M NOT SURE. I LOST THE OWNER'S MANUAL. EITHER WAY, EITHER WAY, FOLKS, THE MONEY WILL BE GONE, BUT I CAN'T WATCH. BECAUSE DURING THE COURSE OF THIS EPISODE, I BONED THAT MONEY. AND...   ( CHEERS )
DON'T DO IT, STEPHEN!
Stephen: GEORGE TAKEI. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?
I'M NOT SURE. I WAS IN THE ELEVATOR ON MY WAY TO ZABARS WHEN I ENDED UP HERE. BUT, I OVERHEARD YOUR PLAN AND ITS MADNESS. DON'T DO IT, STEPHEN.
Stephen: BUT, GEORGE, THIS WILL SOLVE ALL OF OUR ELECTION PROBLEMS AND NO ONE WILL GET HURT.
STEPHEN, DEMOCRACY IS A SACRED TRUST. YES, IT'S A MESSY BUSINESS BUT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE MUST NOT BE ABDICATED TO A MACHINE. ONLY BY ENGAGING MORE DEEPLY IN THE ISSUES AND VOTING YOUR CONSCIENCE CAN WE HOPE TO MOVE BEYOND THE ETERNAL GRIDLOCK THAT THREATENS TO DESTROY OUR SOCIETY. NO MATTER HOW BLEAK THINGS MAY SEEM, YOU HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THEM. DO YOUR DUTY AS AN AMERICAN, AND AS A CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY, VOTE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: I GOTTA SAY, I GOTTA SAY, THOSE ARE POWERFUL WORDS. AND DISINTEGRATE. OH, MY. WATCH MY DOCUMENTARY "TO BE TAKEI," AVAILABLE IN iTUNES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
