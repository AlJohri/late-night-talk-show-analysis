(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK ABOUT CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT JEFFERSON DAVIS. I WILL CLAIM THE INTERVIEW IS ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER THAN SLAVERY. PLEASE WELCOME JAMES MCPHERSON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANKS FOR BEING HERE! YOU ARE A PROFESSOR AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. WELL, LA TEE DA! SOMEBODY"S PRETTY SMART. YOU'RE CONSIDERED AN EXPERT ON THE CIVIL WAR AND AUTHOR OF MANY BOOKS INCLUDING PULITZER PRIZE BATTLE CRY FREEDOM AND YOUR LATEST "EMBATTLED REBEL:  JEFFERSON DAVIS AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF." ARE YOU FROM THE SOUTH?
NO.
STEPHEN: WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
NORTH DAKOTA.
STEPHEN: YOU GOT NO DOG IN THIS FIGHT! WHAT INTERESTS YOU IN THE SOUTH, BEING FROM NORTH DAKOTA? THAT'S AS FAR AWAY FROM THE SOUTH AS NORTH CAN BE
I GREW UP IN MINNESOTA AFTER BORN IN NORTH DAKOTA.
STEPHEN: OKAY. THE SOUTH WAS A MYSTERIOUS, STRANGE LAND TO ME AND I DECIDED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT.
STEPHEN: I BET THE SOUTH FELT PRETTY GOOD ABOUT MID FEBRUARY.
BEING FROM MINNESOTA, THAT'S QUITE TRUE, YES.
STEPHEN: WELL, I'M FROM CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, WHERE WE LIKE TO SAY ALL ROADS LEAD NORTH FROM HERE, AND THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY HOME STATE WHO STILL GET TEARY WHEN YOU START TO TALK ABOUT ROBERT E. LEE, BUT NOBODY GIVES A DAMN ABOUT JEFFERSON DAVIS. (LAUGHTER) HE WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONFEDERACY. I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR BOOK, IT'S A GREAT SUBJECT, BUT WHY DON'T WE LOVE DAVIS?
WELL, DAVIS WAS AT THE TOP OF THE CHAIN. SOMEBODY HAS TO BE BLAMED FOR DEFEAT, AND THE BUCK STOPPED AT THE PRESIDENT'S DESK.
STEPHEN: HE SAID THAT, ORIGINALLY, DIDN'T HE? THE BUCK STOPS HERE.
HARRY TRUMAN SAID THAT.
STEPHEN: HE WAS THE HARRY TRUMAN OF THE CONFEDERACY.
THAT'S CORRECT. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: QUESTION ABOUT DAVIS, GREAT CONFEDERATE OR THE GREATEST CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT?
HE WAS THE ONLY.
STEPHEN: I'LL PUT YOU DOWN FOR GREATEST, BECAUSE I ONLY HAVE GREATER-GREATEST HERE. GROWING UP IN SOUTH CAROLINA, I KNOW THE CIVIL WAR WASN'T PRIMARILY ABOUT SLAVERY.
MM-HMM.
STEPHEN: WHY DID DAVIS FEEL THEY HAD TO SECEDE?
BECAUSE THE CIVIL WAR WAS ABOUT SLAVERY.
STEPHEN: ECONOMIC ISSUES, STATES' RIGHTS BUT NOT SLAVERY.
MM-HMM (LAUGHTER) DAVIS SAID LINCOLN'S ELECTION REPRESENTED A THREAT TO $3 BILLION WORTH OF PROPERTY. SOME OF THAT PROPERTY WAS ACTUALLY JEFFERSON DAVIS' HIMSELF. HE OWNED 113 SLAVES, AND IF SLAVERY DISAPPEARED, HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO GO ON UNEMPLOYMENT.
STEPHEN: DID THEY HAVE THAT? THE CONFEDERATE STATES?
WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO OWNED SLAVES WERE NOT EMPLOYED BECAUSE THE SLAVES DID ALL THE WORK.
STEPHEN: HOW WAS HE AS A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF? DID HE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH LEE?
A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH LEA, IT WAS A CREATIVE PARTNERSHIP.
STEPHEN: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CREATIVE PARTNERSHIP? THAT SOUNDS LIKE THEY WORKED IN A DANCE TROUPE.
WELL, IN A WAY THEY DID.
STEPHEN: IN WAY, THEY WERE IN A DANCE TROUPE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID, OKAY? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WHO'S LEADING IN THIS DANCE? (LAUGHTER)
DAVIS IS LEADING. LEE IS ACTUALLY MANIPULATING HIM TO LEAD IN A CERTAIN WAY.
STEPHEN: WHY DID THE SOUTH LOSE THE CIVIL WAR?
I THINK THE BETTER WAY TO ASK THAT QUESTION IS WHY DID THE NORTH WIN THE CIVIL WAR.
STEPHEN: LET ME ASK IT AGAIN. WHY DID THE SOUTH LOSE THE CIVIL WAR? (APPLAUSE) MY SHOW, MY QUESTION. (LAUGHTER) WHY DID THE NORTH WIN?
THE NORTH WON BECAUSE IT DEVELOPED A BETTER LEADERSHIP BY THE LATTER TWO YEARS OF THE WAR THAT COULD MAKE USE OF THE NORTH'S SUPERIOR RESOURCES. THE NORTH HAD MORE PEOPLE, A STRONGER ECONOMY, MORE GUNS, MORE BUTTER, BUT AT FIRST THEY DIDN'T EMPLOY THIS ADVANTAGE VERY SUCCESSFULLY, BUT BY THE LAST YEAR OR TWO OF THE WAR, LINCOLN HAD PUT TOGETHER A WINNING TEAM OF GRANT AND SHERMAN AND SHERIDAN AND THOMAS AND LINCOLN'S OWN POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, AND THAT EVENTUALLY CARRIED THROUGH TO A VICTORY.
STEPHEN: CAN I POINT OUT SOMETHING? CAN WE HAVE A CLOSE SHOT OF THIS? THERE'S THE COVER. THERE'S JEFFERSON DAVIS RIGHT THERE. I WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING TO YOU. IF I DO THIS AND THIS, IF I DO THIS, OKAY -- (LAUGHTER) -- IF I DO THIS, OKAY, AND THIS -- (LAUGHTER) -- AND   THIS, AND LIKE THAT, LIKE THAT, OKAY -- (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IS THERE ANY CHANCE -- IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT JEFFERSON DAVIS AND LINCOLN WERE THE SAME MAN? DID ANYONE EVER SEE THEM IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER?
NO ONE EVER DID.
STEPHEN: NO ONE EVER SAW THEM? SO THEY COULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME PERSON AND JUST SAID MARY TODD WAS CRAZY TO PROTECT LINCOLN'S SECRET IDENTITY AND THAT'S WHY LINCOLN HAD TO BE ASSASSINATED BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF THEM COULD SURVIVE THE WAR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
STEPHEN: THAT'S YOUR NEXT BOOK.
THAT'S MY NEXT BOOK.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU SO MUCH! (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: JAMES MCPHERSON, "EMBATTLED REBEL". AND THEN GO GET A SHARPIE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
