Stephen: I WANT MORE "BREAKING BAD!"
IT'S OVER, I JUST CAN'T WRITE ANYMORE.
Stephen: IT'S OVER WHEN I SAY IT'S OVER!
THERE'S NO STORY LEFT TO TELL.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT BADGER? CITY PETE? WHAT ABOUT FUEL? WHAT ABOUT TO HIM. WHAT ABOUT WALT, JR.? WHAT ABOUT TO JESSE? DID HE GET IN A CAR ACCIDENT? HE WAS DRIVING PRETTY FAST! WHAT ABOUT WALTER? MAYBE HE'S NOT DEAD! MAYBE HE WAS MAKING IT. MAYBE HE'S GOT A TWIN BROTHER. MAYBE HE WAS JUST DREAMING THE WHOLE TIME AND HE'S STILL BACK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE OR STILL SITTING IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE IN THE FIRST EPISODE LOOKING AT THAT MUSTARD STAIN! THERE'S GOT TO BE AN ANSWER! USE YOUR IMAGINATION.
STEPHEN, PLEASE.
