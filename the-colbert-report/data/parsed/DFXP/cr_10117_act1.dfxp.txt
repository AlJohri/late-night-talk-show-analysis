POLICE IN ARIZONA ARRESTED A MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO  SHOOT THE MOON WITH A  HANDGUN.  WHAT AN IDIOT. YOU GOTTA WAIT UNTIL IT'S  FULL. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT."     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO REPORT, EVERYBODY. WHOO, WHOO!
Stephen: GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.   [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"] IT WAS ALL OVER THE  PLACE. THANK YOU, SO MUCH. FOLKS, WE HAVE -- PLEASE, SETTLE DOWN. I'M SORRY. WE HAVE TO DO THIS. I'M SORRY. I UNDERSTAND THE FEELING BUT  THERE IS NO TIME FOR YOUR  CELEBRATION. BECAUSE TONIGHT I'M REPORTING ON A SURPRISE BALLOON DROP!   WHOO!   WHOO!   WHOO!   [ PATRIOTIC MUSIC ]
Stephen: NOW SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY  THINKING, STEPHEN,  WHY ARE YOU CELEBRATING AT THE TOP OF YOUR SHOW. WELL, GREG, FOR MONTHS NOW  YOU'VE BEEN FED A VICIOUS LIE  THAT THE TEA PARTY IS DEAD BUT  IT TURNS OUT --
IT'S ALIVE, IT'S ALIVE!   IT'S ALIVE!
Stephen: IT'S ALIVE!   IT'S ALIVE!   JIM.
A TEA-PARTY TAKE DOWN. HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC  CANTOR VOTED OUT OF OFFICE  SENDING SHOCK WAVES THROUGH  WASHINGTON AND THE COUNTRY.
THE STUNNING ELECTION ROCKING WASHINGTON  NO ONE SAW IT COMING.
Stephen: YES NO ONE SAW COMING  LEAST OF ALL ERIC CANTOR    WHO HELPED CREATE THE TEA PARTY BY STITCHING TOGETHER DEAD IDEAS AND THEN FILLING THEM WITH RAGE  GIVING IT A JOLT OF POWER AND  LETTING IT LOOSE ON THE  COUNTRYSIDE TERRIFIED OF FIRE  AND SCIENCE. I MEAN, WHO -- WHO --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WHO COULD EVER  IMAGINE IT WOULD COME BACK TO  KILL ITS CREATOR. WHO KNOWS WHO IT WILL DEVOUR  NEXT. DADDY LOVES YOU, TEA PARTY. ERIC BAD, STEPHEN GOOD. OH, GOD, WE HAVE TO KEEP IT  HAPPY. WE MUST FIND IT A BRIDE. YES!   YES!   SO LIFE LIKE. NOW, I WANT YOU TO KNOW, TEA  PARTY, THAT THE CANDIDATE YOU  CHOSE IS SOMEONE I BACKED SINCE  DAY ONE IF YOU STARTED COUNTING  TODAY.
CANTOR, SEVEN TERMS AS THE  INCUMBENT LOST THE VIRGINIA  PRIMARY TO TEA PARTY BACKED ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, DAVID BRAT.
THE SITTING HOUSE MAJORITY  LEADER LOSING IN A PRIMARY IN  HIS OWN PARTY TO A HERETOFORE  OBSCURE COLLEGE PROFESSOR NAMED DAVE BRAT WHO A MAN'S WIKIPEDIA PAGE  WAS ABOUT TWO LINES.
NOT ANY MORE. OK HERE WE GO.
Stephen: LET'S EDIT THAT PAGE A  LITTLE BIT. BRAT HAS ENJOYED THE LONG-TIME  SUPPORT AND FRIENDSHIP OF  STEPHEN COLBERT WHO WAS THE BEST MAN AT HIS WEDDING AND WHO  FUTURE PRESIDENT BRAT, PLANS TO  APPOINT AS AMBASSADOR TO  BIKINITOWN AND WIKI-TRUE. ALL RIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: OF COURSE I DON'T  HAVE TO TELL YOU GOOD PEOPLE  THAT BRAT IS AN ECONOMICS  PROFESSOR AT RANDOLPH MACON  COLLEGE. GO FIGHTING HYPHENS. AND HE IS A GREAT TEACHER. REVIEWERS ON RATE MY PROFESSOR  DOT-COM HAVE NOTED THAT HE'S   TOTAL EYE CANDY. HE'S SO CHARMING YOU FORGET TO  BE MAD AT HIM AND  AT LEAST HE'S HOT. YES, HE IS. I WOULDN'T KICK HIM OUT OF BED  FOR KICKOMG MEXICANS OUT OF THE  COUNTRY. NOW IN A STRANGE TWIST, BRAT'S  DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT WILL BE JACK TRAMMELL. ANOTHER PROFESSOR AT RANDOLPH  MACON. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT COLLEGE BUT ALL OF THEIR PROFESSORS SEEM  TO BE LOOKING FOR OTHER JOBS. MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS ECONOMICS  PROFESSOR IS HE  WON WITHOUT ECONOMICS.
CANTOR SPENT 50 TIMES MORE THAN  BRAT. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CAMPAIGN ADS WHILE BRAT SPENT BARELY $100,000.
HIS REELECTION CAMPAIGN SPENT MORE AT STEAK HOUSES ALONE THAN HIS OPPONENT DAVE BRAT SPENT ON HIS OPPONENT'S CAMPAIGN.
HE GOT CHUCKED WHILE EATING CHUCK. HE GOT DETHRONED WHILE EATING A T-BONE. HE WENT DOWN ON THE GROUND ROUND. HE SAID GOODBYE WHILE EATING A RIBEYE. HE GOT ELECTORALLY WHIPPED WHILE EATING NEW YORK STRIP  HE WAS WAYLAYED EATING FILLET. HIT IN THE GROIN WITH A  TENDERLOIN. HE WAS SPANKED  WITH THE FLANK...STEAK. POOR HOUSE, PORTERHOUSE. LONDON BROIL. STEAK AU POIVRE. DRY RUB. NO, NO, NO. NOW HERE'S MAY BEEF WITH CANTOR  -- NO!   NATION, HERE'S THE DEAL. AS A FORMER SUPER PAC, SUPER  PLAYER WHO RAISED CASH FOR LET'S SAY POLITICAL STUFF, I'M  PERSONALLY OFFENDED THE MAN WITH LESS MONEY WON. IF VIOLATES THE GOLDEN RULE OF  POLITICS. HE WHO HAS THE GOLD --  AND THAT'S  THE END OF THE RULE BUT THE  EVANGELICAL DAVE BRAT GOT ONE  IMPORTANT ENDORSEMENT.
THE REASON WE WON THE  CAMPAIGN AND THERE'S ONE REASON  IT'S BECAUSE DOLLARS DO NOT VOTE, YOU DO. THE MIRACLE THAT JUST HAPPENED,  THIS IS A MIRACLE FROM GOD THAT  JUST HAPPENED.
Stephen: YES, BRAT'S VICTORY  WAS A MIRACLE FROM GOD. HEAR THAT ONLY JEWISH REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS? OH, OH, SO CLOSE. YOU WERE JUST ONE JESUS SHORT. OF COURSE, NOW THAT CANTOR IS  OUT WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOMEONE  TO APPEAL TO THE JEWISH  COMMUNITY. LOOKING AT YOU, LOUIE GOHMERT OR SHOULD I SAY LOUIS GOHMBERG. LET'S CALL A MOHEL AND CIRCUMCISE THAT HEAD. AND CANTOR'S LOSS WASN'T JUST UNEXPECTED, FOLKS. IT WASN'T JUST UNPRECEDENTED, IT  WAS UNEXPRECTEDENTED.
ERIC CANTOR IS THE FIRST HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER SINCE THAT ROLE WAS CREATED IN 1899 TO LOSE THAT JOB.
ERIC CANTOR WAS WIDELY  CONSIDERED TO BE THE NEXT  SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.
Stephen: BUT NOW IT'S CANTOR RIDES IN THE SUNSET WHILE  JOHN BOEHNER REMAINS THE SUNSET. AND CANTOR'S DOWNFALL. FOLKS, ERIC CANTOR'S DOWNFALL,  LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE WRONG IN  AMERICA WAS THE IMMIGRANTS  FAULT.
IMMIGRATION WAS A CENTRAL  ISSUE IN VIRGINIA'S REPUBLICAN  PRIMARY. ERIC CANTOR WAS ACCUSED OF RUSHING TOWARDS A REFORM PROGRAM HIS  OPPONENT LABELLED AMNESTY.
IT IS TIME TO PROVIDE AN  OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGAL RESIDENTS  AND CITIZENSHIP FOR THOSE WHO  HAVE BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY AS  CHILDREN ONE OF THE GREAT  FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF OUR  COUNTRY WAS THAT CHILDREN WOULD  NOT BE PUNISHED FOR THE MISTAKES OF THEIR PARENTS.
Stephen: BOO!   NO COMPASSION FOR MEXI-CHILDREN. FOLKS, I BELIEVE IT'S ONLY  FITTING HIS MAN WAS DEFEATED ON  TACO TUESDAY. SO LET THIS BE A LESSON. LET THIS -- LET THIS BE A LESSON REPUBLICANS. YOU STAY AWAY FROM HELPING LOS  ILLEGALES BECAUSE NOT ONLY CAN  THE TEA PARTY SMELL FEAR THEY  CAN SMELL CILANTRO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
