WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS BEST KNOWN FROM THE LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIES, OUR INTERVIEW WILL BE ADAPTED BY PETER JACKSON INTO THREE FOUR HOUR FILMS. PLEASE WELL VIGGO MORTENSEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHOOO! HEY, VIGGO, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, SO NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW BEFORE BUT I HAVE NEVER HAD YOU AS A GUEST. IT IS A LONG TIME GOAL OF MINE.
YOUR FINAL SEASON. GOOD LUCK WITH THE NEXT PLACE YOU'RE GOING TO.
Stephen: TO HELL IN THE END, MY FRIEND.
I'M SURE WILL YOU DO FINE.
Stephen: WHEREVER I GO, I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS RIGHT NOW. VIGGO, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A MOVIE STAR SO IT MEANS I DON'T TRUST YOU AND I BLAME YOU FOR SOCIETY'S ILLS.
FAIR ENOUGH.
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE NOT JUST A MOVIE STAR, YOU'RE ALSO A MUSICIAN, A PHOTOGRAPHER, A PAINTER, A POET. YOU HAVE APPEARED IN OVER 40 FILMS INCLUDING HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. YOUR NEW MOVIE, YOUR NEW MOVIE IS CALLED "THE TWO FACES OF JANUARY" IN THEATRES SEPTEMBER 26th. JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE IDEA HERE. WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT THIS INTERVIEW ENDS IN A NAKED KNIFE FIGHT? BECAUSE I GOT THE KNIVES IF YOU'VE GOT THE NAKED. I'M READY TO GO.
WELL, THIS MOVIE DOES HARKEN BACK TO A BYGONE ERA WHEN MEN HAD TO DRINK A LOT OF ALCOHOL BEFORE THEY WOULD GET NAKED IN FRONT OF ONE ANOTHER. SO I THINK AFTER A FEW DRINKS WE COULD SHOW EACH OTHER OUR KNIVES, I THINK. ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU PLAY A CONMAN.
I DO.
Stephen: IS HE THE HERO OR THE VILLIAN BECAUSE CONMAN DOESN'T SOUND GOOD?
HE'S A KIND OF BAD GUY THAT YOU WANT TO GET AWAY WITH EVERYTHING. SOMEHOW. AT LEAST THAT'S HOW I SAW IT.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP. LET'S SHOW THE GOOD GUY BAD GUY.
I'D LIKE TO DANCE
MAY I FINISH MY SCOTCH FIRST.
YEAH?
♪ KNOCK YOURSELF OUT
♪ KNOCK YOURSELF OUT
♪ KNOCK YOURSELF OUT
♪ KNOCK YOURSELF OUT
Stephen: I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT DOESN'T END WELL.
NO RIGHT THERE YOU COULD SEE I WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING NAKED. I'M GETTING THERE, I'M GETTING THERE. OR AT LEAST IMAGINING A KNIFE FIGHT.
YES.
Stephen: AFTER ACTING FOR SO MANY YEARS, DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE ANY MORE? BECAUSE ACTORS ARE LIARS, BASICALLY. YOU LIE ABOUT WHO YOU ARE TO AN AUDIENCE. IS THERE ANYTHING LEFT OF VIGGO?
NOT MUCH, NO.
Stephen: YOU DO, YOU HAVE TO REINVENT YOURSELF ALL THE TIME.
YEAH, I ACCEPT IT. I LIKE IT, I REVEL IN IT.
Stephen: OF SUBSUMING WHO ARE YOU TO A CHARACTER.
LYING, CHEATING, YEAH, ALL THAT. SO PLAYING A CONMAN WAS KIND OF LIKE TYPE CASTING, REALLY.
Stephen: THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU DO THE POETRY, THE MUSIC, THE ART, THE PHOTOGRAPHY, WHY DO THAT? THAT SOUNDS LIKE MUCH MORE WORK THAN ACTING IS BECAUSE THAT INVOLVES ACTUALLY HAVING TO PRODUCE A PHYSICAL THING THAT YOU GIVE TO SOMEONE WHEREAS ACTING YOU CAN GO IN THERE, YOU REFLECT LIGHT AND YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE. WHY WOULD YOU-- WHAT IS IT, WHAT IS IT ABOUT THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT ATTRACT YOU WHEN YOU HAVE ALREADY GOT THE STARDOM?
I'M INSECURE.
Stephen: ARE YOU REALLY?
A LOT OF ACTORS ARE.
NO, I'M RESTLESS. I LIKE TO BE BUSY. I ALWAYS FEEL THAT LIFE IS SHORT AND I JUST WANT TO LEARN AS MUCH AS I CAN.
Stephen: REALLY? WOW.
AND I LIKE BOOKS, I LIKE TO READ BOOKS, I LIKE TO-- DO YOU, CAN YOU? I CAN, I COULD, I COULD, I JUST DON'T LIKE TO SHOW OFF BY READING. NO,-- I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU VERY GOOD WITH ACCENTS. YOU CAN DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT ACCENTS.
I DON'T KNOW. WITH SOME STUDY, SURE.
Stephen: WELL, I'VE GOT TWO HATS HERE. IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME FOR A MOMENT. ONE OF THEM IS A LIST OF ACCENTS, ANOTHER IS SOMETHING I WOULD WANT TO YOU SAY IN THAT ACCENT.
WILL WE TAKE TURNS.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE TURNS? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY, GREAT. YOU FIRST, PICK YOUR ACCENT, WHAT ACCENT YOU HAVE TO SAY IT IN. OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
ARE THEY ALL THE SAME CARD?
NO, NO IN IS WHAT I WANT TO YOU SAY, THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO SAY ANY ONE OF THEM, OKAY.
I SWEAR IT WAS THE DOG.
WAS THAT ARWEN.
THAT WAS ARWEN YOU COULD-- ARWAN COUSIN.
I WILL GO NEXT. HERE WE GO. OKAY. SPANISH. THESE TWO DON'T GO WELL TOGETHER FOR ME.
I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. VIGGO MORTENSEN, THE TWO FACES OF JANUARY, OPENS NEXT FRIDAY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
