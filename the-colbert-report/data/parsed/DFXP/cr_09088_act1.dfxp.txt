Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US. THANK YOU, FOLKS. I APPRECIATE IT, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  PLEASE, FOLKS  WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING. IT HAS BEEN THREE DAYS AND  CONCRETE INFORMATION ABOUT THE  TERROR ATTACKS IN BOSTON HAS BEEN SLOW IN COMING. LUCKILY, THERE IS ONE NEWS  OUTLET THAT DOESN'T LET LACK OF  FACTS GET IN THE WAY OF REPORTING THEM. OF COURSE, THAT'S THE "NEW YORK  POST."  TODAY, THEY RAN THIS COVER STORY  SHOWING TWO MEN FROM THE MARATHON CROWD UNDER THE  HEADLINE "BAG MEN: FEDS SEEK  THESE TWO PICTURED AT BOSTON MARATHON."  SO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THESE  GUYS. ( LAUGHTER )  AND WHILE YOU'RE ON THE LOOKOUT  FOR THESE GUYS, KEEP IN MIND,  THESE ARE NOT THE GUYS. ( LAUGHTER ). TURNS OUT, IT WAS THESE OTHER  GUYS.
WE ARE RELEASING PHOTOS OF  THESE TWO SUSPECTS. THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AS SUSPECT 1  AND SUSPECT 2. SOMEBODY OUT THERE KNOWS THESE  INDIVIDUALS AS FRIENDS,  NEIGHBORS, COWORKERS OR FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE SUSPECTS.
Stephen:  YOU HEARD HIM. IF YOU KNOW EITHER OF THESE  INDIVIDUALS-- PERHAPS AS  FRIENDS, PERHAPS AS COWORKERS, OR MAYBE YOU WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL  WITH SOMEONE NAMED SUSPECT 1 OR  SUSPECT 2, GO TO  bostonmarathontips.fbi.gov. AND SPEAKING OF TIPS, QUICK TIP  OF THE HAT TO THE "NEW YORK  POST" FOR ACCUSING THESE TWO INNOCENT MEN OF A HORRIBLE CRIME  BECAUSE ANYONE CAN PRINT  ACCURATE INFORMATION. BUT THE "POST" ALWAYS FOLLOWS  THE FOUR Ws OF JOURNALISM,  WHO, WHATEVER, AND WHY WAIT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NATION, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH  DOING A SHOW LIKE THIS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO HELP FROM ANYONE  ELSE IS THAT IF I LEAVE, IT  CRUMBLES. SO I CAN'T GO OUT AND COVER  STORIES FROM DANGEROUS PLACES  LIKE MY GUEST TONIGHT RICHARD  ENGEL. BESIDES, WHAT IF I GET TO SYRIA  AND THEY DON'T HAVE MY BRAND OF  CONDITIONER? ( LAUGHTER )  NOW, I THOUGHT ABOUT SENDING OUT  A CORRESPONDENT, BUT WHO COULD I  TRUST TO REPRESENT ME? AND THERE WAS ONE GUY FROM THE  "DAILY SHOW."  BUT HE'S GOT HIS OWN PROGRAM  NOW.
AND HEAR HE'S A BIT OF A  PRIMA DONNA. ( LAUGHTER )  AND I WOULD LOVE, LOVE TO BE OUT  AMONG YOU, THE COMMON FOLK. THE UNWASHED MASSES, BUT I'M SO  FAMOUS NOW, I CAN'T EVEN GO FOR  A WALK HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. BUT THEN, I REMEMBERED, A PIECE  OF TECHNOLOGY I INVENTED LAST  YEAR WHILE INTERVIEWING DOCUMENTARIAN ERROL MORRIS. WHEN YOU INTERVIEW PEOPLE YOU'RE  NOT IN THE ROOM WITH THEM. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A SCREEN THAT  YOU'RE LOOKING AT WITH YOUR FACE  ON IT WHILE YOU ASK THEM  QUESTIONS?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen:  INSPIRED BY THAT  I CREATED SOMETHING CALLED THE  ASK-O-MATIC. IT'S AN iPAD HOT GLUED TO A  BUCKET. ( LAUGHTER ). ( APPLAUSE )  WELL, FOLKS, SINCE I DEBUTED THE  ASK-O-MATIC, ALL RIGHT--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) -- SINCE I DEBUTED THIS CUTTING  EDGE TECHNOLOGY, THE GOOD FOLKS  AT COLBERT LABS HAVE COME UP WITH A GAME-CHANGING  INNOVATION-- A SECOND BUCKET. NOW, WHY IS IT BETTER? FIRST OF ALL, IT'S DOUBLE THE  BUCKETS. AND I CAN PUT AN iPHONE INSIDE  THIS BUCKET. AND USING FACE TIME I CAN PUT MY  FACE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE  SECOND BUCKET, THEREBY TELEPORTING MY HEAD ON TO  SOMEBODY ELSE'S BODY. AND ALLOWING ME TO BE EVERYWHERE  WITHOUT GOING ANYWHERE. ( LAUGHTER )  RECENTLY, I PUT THIS EXCITING  NEW TECHNOLOGY INTO ACTION. I CALLED ON MY RELIABLE AND  EXPENDABLE INTERN JAY FOR THE  BUCKET MAIDEN VOYAGE. ( LAUGHTER )  IT FELT WONDERFUL TO GET OUT AND  BREATHE SOME FRESH AIR. FINALLY, HERE WAS MY CHANCE TO  SEE NEW YORK, NEW YORK, THE CITY  SO NICE I'D ACTUALLY SEEN VERY LITTLE OF IT. TO CONNECT WITH MY FELLOW NEW  YORKERS, I DECIDED TO HEAD  STRAIGHT TO WHERE ALL REAL NEW NEW YORKERS HANG OUT-- TIMES SQUARE. HI. WHAT'S UP! HOW YOU DOING? WHAT'S UP, MY SISTER! PEOPLE WERE A BIT STAND-OFFISH  AT FIRST, NO DOUBT BECAUSE I'M  FAMOUS. SO I DECIDED TO SPEND A LITTLE  TIME WITH MY FELLOW CELEBRITIES. DO YOU HAVE THE EXPRESS WRITTEN  PERMISSION OF THE HENSON COMPANY  TO BE WEARING THIS OUTFIT RIGHT  NOW? ALL YOU'RE SAYING IS LA-LA-LA. "L" IS FOR LAWYER, ELMO, AND  YOU'RE GOING TO NEED ONE. SEE YOU IN JAIL, GUYS. LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE. YOU HAVE THAT ONE RIGHT THERE. I'LL JUST GRAB THAT MAGAZINE. HOW MUCH IS THIS MAGAZINE? I'D LIKE TO HAVE IT.
$3.
Stephen:  I'LL GIVE YOU $1. THIS IS PART OF YOUR CULTURE,  RIGHT?
NOT PART OF A CULTURE.
JAY, GET OUT OF THERE, GO,  GO. GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. EVENTUALLY, I BLENDED IN WITH  EVERYONE ELSE, AND EVEN MADE A  FEW FRIENDS. ( LAUGHTER )
HI. I'M DANIELLE.
DAVID.?RU
Stephen:  YOU CAN GO NOW,  DAVID HI! HUGS! HUGS! THIS IS TOTALLY FINE. I'M NOT EVEN THERE. THANK YOU, EXCELLENT. WHAT DO YOU DO IN TIMES SQUARE? DO-- SHOULD WE JUST HANG OUT  UNTIL THE BALL DROPS?
NO, I'M ACTUALLY-- I'M A  STREET MUSICIAN.
Stephen:  OH, REALLY WHAT,  DO YOU PLAY?
WOODWIND.
Stephen:  DO YOU HAVE YOUR  OBOE WITH YOU?
NO I DON'T HAVE MY OBOY. I HAVE MY SAXOPHONE AT HOME.
Stephen:  SAXOPHONE IS NOT  A WOOD INSTRUMENT IT'S A BASS  INSTRUMENT
A WOODWIND.
Stephen:  A WOODWIND IS  LIKE AN OBONE. I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT.
YOU CAN'T FIGHT BECAUSE  YOU'RE IN THERE.
Stephen:  OH, I CAN FIGHT  YOU. LOOK, I'M GOING TO PUSH YOU ON  YOUR SHOULDER. LISTEN, YOU WANT TO FIGHT RIGHT  NOW, BERNARD.
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE GUY IS  IN THERE, BUT YOU KNOW, I'LL  WHIP HIS ASS.
Stephen:  I SAY WE FIGHT  RIGHT NOW. OR YOU'RE A COWARD. YOU'RE A-- YOU'RE A BRASS  INSTRUMENT-PLAYING COWARD.
I'M GOING TO WHIP YOUR  FRIEND'S ASS, I'M TELL YOU RIGHT  NOW.
Stephen:  ( CLUCK )
DON'T GET THAT GUY IN  TROUBLE?
WHY BECAUSE HE'LL PUSH OUT  SHOULDER AGAIN? DO DID IT. DO IT.
I'M GOING TO DUST THIS GUY  OFF, MAN. I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU, MAN.
Stephen:  WHAT BRINGS YOU  TO THE BIG APPLE?
IT'S MY FIRST TIME HERE. WE WENT TO SEE "WICKED" LAST  NIGHT.
Stephen:  ARE YOU GOING TO  SCORE ANY WEED?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT?
Stephen:  JUST MAKE SURE  YOU DO IT LEGALLY BY ASKING A  COP WHERE TO SMOKE POT. ( LAUGHTER ). I DOPED UP QUITE AN APPETITE. MMM-MMM-MMM. YES, MY GOOD MAN, HELLO, WHERE  ARE YOU FROM?
I'M FROM EGYPT.
Stephen:  YOU'RE FROM  EGYPT.
DO YOU WANT SOME KETCHUP?
Stephen:  NO, KETCHUP IS  FOR PUZZIES. GOT IT, GOT IT, RIGHT. HI, I'M STEVE C. I LOVE ICE CREAM. AND I LOVE GIANT HEADS AND TINY  BODIES.
