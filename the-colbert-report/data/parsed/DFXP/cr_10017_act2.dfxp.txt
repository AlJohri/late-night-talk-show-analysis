Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCHED THIS, AND I HOPE YOU DO, YOU MUST KNOW THAT IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE ALL-STAR TEAM OF PATRIOTS OVER FOX NEWS. THEY'RE LIKE THE HARLEM GLOBE TROT TERS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT DO NOT TROT THE HARLEM. AS ALL THINGS TO NEWS CORPORATE FOUNDER AND WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL RAISIN RUPERT MURR DOCHBLINGT THAT IS WHY I'M PERSONALLY SO ENRAGED ABOUT THE PAUDRY HIT JOB MURDOCH WORLD WRITTEN BY JOURNALISTIC HACK DAVID FALLENFLICK WHO IS MY GUEST TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING, SIR, IT'S AN HONOR. TO YOU LISTEN TO HOW, AND I HOPE I CAN SAY THAT WORD ON THE AIR, HAS BEEN ACCUSING NEWS CORPORATE-- NEWS CORP. OF PUBLIC RELATION SKULL DUGGERY.
THEY HAD STAFFERS FOR YEARS GO ON-LINE AND REBUT EVERY BLOG POST THAT WAS NEGATIVE, EVERY ARTICLE.
FOX STAFFERS EXPECTED TO COUNTER NOT JUST NEGATIVE, EVEN NEUTRAL BLOG POSTINGS BUT THE ANTI-FOX COMMENTS BENEATH THEM.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO POLICE THE COMMENTS SECTION, THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF A ON-LINE ARTICLE. IT IS THE ONLY REASON I KNOW THAT THE ONGOING WAR IN SYRIA IS GAY RON PAUL 2012. NOW FOX, FOX BUILT ITS COMMENTING ARMY FROM THE GROUND UP AND ALSO OUT OF THE THIN AIR DOWN. BECAUSE ONE FORMER STAFFER RECALLED USING 20 DIFFERENT ALIASES TO POST PRO FOX RANTS. ANOTHER HAD 100. I MEAN THEY HAD TO DO THAT. FOX NEWS'S ACTUAL AUDIENCE CAN'T GO ON THE INTERNET. THEY STILL CALL IT THAT ROCK 'N' ROLL TELEGRAM. BUT OF COURSE THAT WAS ALL BLOC POSTINGS. THESE DAYS PEOPLE GET THEIR NEWS VIA THE TWITTER BIRD AND FOX CAN'T POLICE THE TWATEVERSE BY THEMSELVES. SO FOLKSING I'M STEPPING IN. ONE OF MY WRITERS ROB DUBIN WHOSE NAME IS SPECIFICALLY NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS SCRIPT, DESIGNED A TWITTER ALGORITHM TO PICK UP WHERE FOX NEWS LEFT OFF. INTRODUCING@REALHUMANPRAISE TWITTER'S PREMIER SOURCE FOR LEGITIMATE REVIEWS FROM 100% PEOPLE. AS ASSEMBLED BY BOTH. HERE IS HOW IT WORKS. EVERY TWO MEANS@REAL HUMAN PRAISE TAKES A POSITIVE FILM REVIEW FROM ROTTEN TOM TOM AND SWAPS IN THE NAMES OF BELOVED FOX NEWS SHOWS AND PERSONALITIES. FOR INSTANCE, THIS ONE USED TO BE A POSITIVE REVIEW FOR THE HORROR CLASSIC THE OMEN BUT NOW IT READS ALL REFERENCES TO PROPHECY AND THE ANTI-CHRIST ASIDE SHEPHERD MISREPORTING ACHIEVES THIS HORROR THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.
THAT'S GOOD.
PERSONALLY I CANNOT WAIT TO GET THE BOT UP AND RUNG. OH WAIT, WE LAUNCHED IT A WEEK AGO AND IT'S ALREADY POSTED 5,000 TWEETS? INCLUDING SUCH RAVES AS IF MIKE HUCKABEE DOESN'T FIND YOU WISHING YOU HAD A GUN ON YOU, THIS IS ONE OF HIS BETTER EFFORTS. THE TELLE FILE EMPHASIZES THE PURPOSE OF FAIRY TEAMS IN OUR LIVES AND THE WAY A FANTASY CAN HELP US SEE REALITY MORE CLEARLY. SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRETT BAYER IS THE MOST FUN YOU'LL HAVE WHILE WATCHING SOMEONE DESTROY THEMSELVES. AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING IT, HANNITY LIVES UP TO ITS TITLE.
TRUE-- TRUER WORDS HAVE NEVER BEEN.
THE FOX IS POSTING WITH THE HASHTAG PRAISE FOX AND LIKE BILL O REILLY WILL JUST KEEP TALKING UNTIL SOMEONE PULLS THE PLUG. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH
