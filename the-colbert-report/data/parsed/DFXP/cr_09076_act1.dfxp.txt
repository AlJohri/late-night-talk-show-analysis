[EAGLE CAW] Stephen: TONIGHT, I UNCOVER  SECRET DATA IN YOUR FACEBOOK  PROFILE. TURNS OUT KAREN LIKING YOUR  PHOTO MEANS SHE WANTS TO GET  BACK TOGETHER WITH YOU. [LAUGHTER] THEN, HOW TO SPOT RADICAL  MUSLIMS, AND EVEN MORE DANGEROUS  GNARLY MUSLIMS. [LAUGHTER] AND MY GUEST, CARL EDGAR BLAKE,  IS A FARMER WHO SAYS HE KNOWS  HOW TO BREED THE PERFECT PIG. STEP ONE: FIND A SPIDER THAT CAN  SPELL. [LAUGHTER] JON HAMM IS SICK OF EVERYONE  TALKING ABOUT HIS GIANT PENIS. SO, MEDIA, YOU CAN START TALKING  ABOUT MINE. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN" BRRK [  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. PLEASE, PLEASE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH, NATION. FOLKS -- FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS TRUE, YOU KNOW, I SAY IT  EVERY OTHER NIGHT BUT TONIGHT IT  IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH ME. BECAUSE FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL  YOU -- I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE  RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE I AM SHAKEN TO THE CORE  BY SOMETHING I HAVE LEARNED IN  THE LAST 24 HOURS. WELL, I'M SHAKEN THAT I LEARNED  ANYTHING. I LIKE TO KEEP THINGS TIDY UP  HERE. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, IT IS LOOKING MORE AND  MORE LIKE THE SUPREME COURT MAY  DECIDE THAT IT'S LEGAL FOR GAY PEOPLE TO GET MARRIED. AND THAT'S OKAY WITH PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER] SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I'M THE  ONLY ONE HOLDING THIS COUNTRY  TOGETHER. [LAUGHTER] I USED TO THINK I HAD A LIFE  PARTNER IN BILL O'REILLY. [LAUGHTER] BUT LAST NIGHT EVEN PAPA BEAR  LET ME DOWN. LISTEN TO HIS ANALYSIS OF THE  GAY MARRIAGE CASE.
THE COMPELLING ARGUMENT IS ON  THE SIDE OF HOMOSEXUALS. THAT'S WHERE THE COMPELLING  ARGUMENT IS. WE'RE AMERICANS. WE JUST WANT TO BE TREATED LIKE  EVERYBODY ELSE.
Stephen: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. [LAUGHTER] ON GAY MARRIAGE, BILL O'REILLY  HAS FLIP FLOPPED! THE GAYEST OF ALL BEACH SANDALS! RAV LAUGH. [LAUGHTER] AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE  SAID NEXT.
THE GAY MARRIAGE THING, I  DON'T FEEL THAT STRONGLY ABOUT  IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
Stephen: WHAT?! [LAUGHTER] BILL O'REILLY DOESN'T FEEL  STRONGLY ABOUT SOMETHING?! [LAUGHTER]
WHAT IS HAPPENING? [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: YOU ARE BILL  O'REILLY. READ YOUR (bleep) CONTRACT. FIREMEN PUT OUT FIRES, HOMELESS  PEOPLE ARE CRAZY, AND YOU FEEL  STRONGLY ABOUT EVERYTHING. ESPECIALLY GAY MARRIAGE. YOU USED TO. [LAUGHTER]
IF YOU OK GAY MARRIAGE, THEN  YOU HAVE TO DO PLURAL MARRIAGE. YOU WOULD LET EVERYBODY GET  MARRIED WHO WANT TO GET MARRIED. YOU WANT TO MARRY A TURTLE, YOU  CAN. ANYBODY COULD HAVE GOTTEN  MARRIED. YOU COULD HAVE MARRIED A DUCK. AND 10 YEARS, THIS IS GONNA BE A  TOTALLY DIFFERENT  COUNTRY THAN  IT IS RIGHT NOW. LAWS THAT YOU THINK ARE IN  STONE -- THEY'RE GONNA  EVAPORATE, MAN. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MARRY A GOAT. YOU MARK MY WORDS!
Stephen: I DID MARK YOUR  WORDS! I RECORDED THEM. [LAUGHTER] AND BILL HAS VERY STRONG  FEELINGS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLES  OPINIONS OF GAY MARRIAGE. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID ABOUT  CLINTON SIGNING THE DEFENSE OF  MARRIAGE ACT IN '96 BUT COMING OUT IN FAVOR OF GAY  MARRIAGE NOW.
WHEN HE SIGNED IT, IT WASN'T  A BIG DEAL. NOW IT'S A BIG DEAL. HE CHANGES. YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY. BILL CLINTON -- YOU'RE A PHONY,  BILL CLINTON. YOU'RE A PHONY.
Stephen: YEAH, WHAT A PHONY. BUT BILL O'REILLY'S NO PHONY,  AND THAT'S WHAT'S SHAKEN ME TO  MY CORE. [LAUGHTER] 'CUZ IF BILL O'REILLY IS NOW  PRO-GAY MARRIAGE, AND ISN'T A  FLIP-FLOPPER LIKE BILL CLINTON, THEN BACK WHEN HE SAID GAY  MARRIAGE WAS LIKE MARRYING A  GOAT, HE WAS REALLY TELLING US THAT HE'S PRO-GOAT MARRIAGE. [LAUGHTER] GOAT, THIS IS BILL. [LAUGHTER] GOAT. NOW, BEFORE ANY OF YOU JUDGE THE [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I KNOW THIS SHOCKING BUT BEFORE  ANY OF YOU JUDGE THE  O'REILLYS -- I, TOO, USED TO CONDEMN MAN-GOAT LOVE -- THE  LOVE THAT DARE NOT  "MEHHH" IT'S NAME -- BUT, LIKE  SO MANY AMERICANS, I NOW KNOW SOMEONE WHO BYPASSED MATCH.COM  AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PETTING  ZOO. [LAUGHTER] AND PLEASE DON'T REDUCE THIS TO  JUST A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP. DON'T MAKE THIS UGLY. THOUGH I'M SURE THEY DO HAVE  SEX. AND I BET IT'S PRETTY UGLY. [LAUGHTER] BUT THAT'S JUST A SMALL THREAD  IN THE RICH TAPESTRY OF BILL  OREILLY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH A  GOAT. NO ONE SHOULD BE DENIED THE  RIGHT TO VISIT HIS SICK LOVER AT  THE VET. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS ABOUT A MAN AND A GOAT  WHO WANT TO SHARE ALL OF THE  JOYS AND SORROWS OF LIFE  TOGETHER. AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO MAKE A  LIFELONG COMMITMENT, WE SHOULD  HONOR IT. AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT  THAT. AND BILL, I'D LOVE TO BE YOUR  WEDDING PLANNER. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS JUST ONE IDEA -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE'S ONE IDEA: YOU CAN SAVE A  LOT BY USING THE CANS YOU TIE TO  THE BACK OF THE CAR AS ONE OF THE ENTREES. NATION -- OH, I ALMOST FORGOT  WE'VE GOT A SPONSOR TONIGHT. WE DO THAT EVERY SO OFTEN. THIS IS A GOOD ONE, IT'S THE  CADILLAC OF CORPORATE SPONSORS--  BECAUSE IT'S CADILLAC. GO BUY ONE. IS THAT ENOUGH? [LAUGHTER] NO. OKAY. WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. WE'LL WEAVE IT IN LATER. ALL RIGHT. NATION, I'M A HUGE SCIENCE BUFF. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MAY KNOW THAT  NICOLAS COPERNICUS FORMULATED  THE HELIOCENTRIC MODEL, WHICH POSTULATED THAT THE EARTH  TRAVELED AROUND THE SUN. BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT HE'S ALSO  A HERETIC WHO WILL BURN IN HELL  FOR ALL ETERNITY? THAT'S SCIENCE! SO I WAS THRILLED TO LEARN ABOUT  AN EXCITING SCIENTIFIC  BREAKTHROUGH.
THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE  OVER IN LONDON ACTUALLY DID A  STUDY ON NEARLY 60,000 FACEBOOK  USERS. AND WHAT THEY FOUND IN  CONCLUSION WAS THAT ALL OF YOUR  "LIKES"  THAT YOU'RE CLICKING CAN TELL MORE ABOUT YOU THAN YOU  MIGHT HAVE REALIZED, FROM  YOUR  POLITICAL VALUES TO RELIGION TO YOUR GENDER, HAPPINESS AND AGE.
IN FACT, SOME PARTS OF YOUR  IDENTITY COULD BE PREDICTED WITH  95 PERCENT ACCURACY.
Stephen: YES, FACEBOOK LIKES  CAN REVEAL YOUR PERSONALITY  TRAITS, JUST AS FRIENDSTER LIKES CAN REVEAL THAT YOU STOPPED  USING THE INTERNET IN 2003. [LAUGHTER] TO GATHER DATA, THE SCIENTISTS  GAVE VOLUNTEERS A SERIES OF  PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS THROUGH A FACEBOOK APP THEY CREATED. AND BECAUSE IT'S FACEBOOK, THE  TESTS STARTED AS MULTIPLE-CHOICE  QUESTIONS AND SLOWLY BECAME NOTHING BUT PHOTOS OF THE  SCIENTISTS' CHILDREN. [LAUGHTER] THE SCIENTISTS TOOK THOSE TEST  RESULTS THEN COMPARED THEM TO  USERS' FACEBOOK "LIKES," TO LEARN WHICH LIKES MATCHED UP  WITH WHICH TYPES OF PEOPLE. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY FOUND THAT  HOMOSEXUAL MEN TENDED TO LIKE  KATHY GRIFFIN,  ADAM LAMBERT, AND "WICKED," THE MUSICAL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, SCIENCE. FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, CANCER--  STILL NOT CURED. OKAY. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELL, NATION, I DON'T NEED SOME  STUDY TO TELL ME WHO'S GAY AND  WHO ISN'T. THAT'S WHAT SCARVES ARE FOR. [LAUGHTER] THE STUDY ALSO CONTAINED THE  BLOCKBUSTER REVELATION THAT  PEOPLE WITH MANY FRIENDS LIKED JENNIFER LOPEZ, WHILE VOLUNTEERS  WITH FEW FRIENDS LIKED  WALKING WITH YOUR FRIEND AND RANDOMLY PUSHING THEM INTO  SOMEONE OR SOMETHING. HEY, NOT THEIR FAULT THEY DON'T  HAVE FRIENDS. EVERYONE THEY KNOW KEEPS GETTING  RANDOMLY PUSHED INTO TRAFFIC. [LAUGHTER] BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE STUDY  REVEALED WHAT YOUR FACEBOOK  LIKES SAY ABOUT HOW SMART YOU  ARE. RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT HIGH IQ  CORRESPONDS TO LIKING MOZART,  SCIENCE, AND-- "THE COLBERT REPORT!" [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT CAN I SAY? THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS [CROWD  CHANTING STEPHEN] I DON'T BLAME  YOU I AM SMART! NATION, IF YOU LIKE MY SHOW, YOU  ARE SMART. END OF STORY. DON'T ASK QUESTIONS. THAT'S NOT WHAT SMART PEOPLE DO. [LAUGHTER] AND MY VIEWERS AREN'T JUST  SMART, I'M TALKING THE KIND OF  HEAVYWEIGHT INTELLECTS WHO, ACCORDING TO THIS STUDY, ALSO  LIKE CURLY FRIES. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT JUST MAKES SENSE, CURLY  FRIES ARE THE ONLY SIDE DISH  WHERE YOU HAVE TO CALCULATE THE TANGENT OF THE EXTERNAL ARC  BEFORE CRAMMING IT INTO YOUR  FRY-HOLE. [LAUGHTER] NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, TIME  TO GET MY THINK ON. MMMM, I CAN FEEL MY BRAIN  GETTING BIGGER. BRAIN IS IN THE HIPS, RIGHT? THERE'S NOTHING I ASSOCIATE MORE  WITH REFINED, INTELLIGENT  CULTURE THAN A CRISP GLISTENING CURLY FRY. IT'S THE SAMPLER PLATTER. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY STICK OUT  THEIR PINKIES IN THE FIRST  PLACE? TO HOLD THE NEXT CURLY FRY. MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS? I'M AN AVERAGE JOE. I DON'T WANT TO COME OFF AS SOME  KIND OF IVORY TOWER CURLY FRY  ELITIST. AFTER ALL, YOU CAN ONLY GET  CURLY FRIES -- THE CADILLAC OF  FRIES -- WAS THAT ENOUGH? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NO. YOU ONLY FIND CURLY FRIES AT  FINER RESTAURANTS, YOUR  ARBY'S, YOUR JACK IN THE BOX. AND GOOD LUCK GETTING A  RESERVATION THERE. I'VE CALLED -- THEY WON'T EVEN  LET ME TALK TO JACK! [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [
