Stephen: WE WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, EVERY SO OFTEN I LIKE TO  SALUTE THE MEN OR LADY MEN WHO  HAVE THE BIGGEST BALLS IN THESE U.S. OF A.'S. THIS IS MY ALPHA DOG OF THE  WEEK. [GROWL] THIS WEEK'S ALPHA DOGS ARE THE  PACK OF PUREBRED REPUBLICANS IN  THE VIRGINIA STATE SENATE. [GROWL] ON MONDAY, THEY REDREW THE  DISTRICT LINES FOR THE VIRGINIA  STATE SENATE TO "MAKE EIGHT ELECTORAL DISTRICTS, SIX OF THEM  PRESENTLY HELD BY DEMOCRATS,  MORE HEAVILY REPUBLICAN," AND TO "CONCENTRATE MORE MINORITY  VOTERS IN A NEW SOUTHSIDE  DISTRICT."  AND THEY DID IT BY PUSHING "THE RE-DRAWN STATE POLITICAL MAP  PAST FLABBERGASTED DEMOCRATS."  FRANKLY, I DON'T SEE WHY THESE DEMOCRATS' GASTS ARE SO  FLABBERED. [ LAUGHTER ] THE STATE SENATE IS SPLIT 20  REPUBLICANS AND 20 DEMOCRATS. WHY DIDN'T THE DEMOCRATS STOP  THEM? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE THESE REPUBLICANS ARE  ALPHA DOGS.
REPUBLICANS CHOSE TO  INTRODUCE THE LEGISLATION  ON A  DAY WHEN ONE DEMOCRAT WASN'T  THERE.
Stephen: YES, THEY WAITED  UNTIL DEMOCRAT SENATOR AND  LONG-TIME CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER HENRY MARSH LEFT TOWN ON MARTIN  LUTHER KING DAY TO ATTEND  PRESIDENT OBAMA'S INAUGURATION. [AUDIENCE REACTS] HOW FITTING. IN THE WORDS OF DR. KING, "I  HAVE BEEN TO THE MOUNTAINTOP,  AND WHILE I WAS THERE, THEY HEAVILY REDISTRICTED THE  PROMISED LAND." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE WAY THESE GOOD OL' ALPHA  DOGS REALLY SWUNG THEIR SACKS IN  THE FACES OF BLACK VOTERS WAS THAT AFTER THIS VOTE ON MARTIN  LUTHER KING DAY THEY "ADJOURNED  IN MEMORY OF CONFEDERATE GENERAL STONEWALL JACKSON." [AUDIENCE REACTS] WHAT BETTER WAY TO HONOR  DR. KING? BECAUSE IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE  CONFEDERACY, HE WOULDN'T HAVE  HAD THAT MUCH TO DO. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW THE BILL --  YOU'RE WELCOME. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW THE BILL STILL HAS TO BE  SIGNED BY VIRGINIA GOVERNOR BOB  MCDONNELL, WHO SAID "OBVIOUSLY THE TACTICS USED  YESTERDAY WERE A SURPRISE AND I  DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WAY BUSINESS SHOULD BE DONE," BUT HE  DIDN'T PROMISE TO VETO IT,  SAYING INSTEAD "IF I GET A BILL, I'LL DEAL WITH IT AT THAT TIME."
Stephen: YEAH, GAME TIME  DECISION. AFTER ALL, IF SOMEBODY OFFERED  ME A PANDA-BURGER, I'D  DEFINITELY SAY THE IDEA IS REPELLANT AND OFFENSIVE. BUT, IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO  THROW IT OUT-- [ LAUGHTER ] SO VIRGINIA STATE SENATE, FOR  PUTTING REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP ON  THE MAP-- AND THEN HEAVILY REDRAWING THAT MAP IN YOUR  FAVOR, YOU ARE MY ALPHA DOGS OF  THE WEEK. [GROWL] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
