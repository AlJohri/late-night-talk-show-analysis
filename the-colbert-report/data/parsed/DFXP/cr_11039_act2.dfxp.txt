(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, NATION, I GOT SUCH URGENT NEWS RIGHT NOW, I DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. THIS IS COLD WAR UPDATE. FOLKS, IF YOU ARE LOYAL WATCHERS OF THIS SHOW YOU KNOW I HAVE SAID FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS THE COLD WAR NEVER ENDED AND NOW I HAVE PROOF BECAUSE TODAY IT ENDED.
BREAKING NEWS, A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN U.S. RELATIONS WITH CUBA. THE CUBAN EMBARGO THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 1963 WILL BE LIFTED BY THIS PRESIDENT.
WE WILL END AN OUTDATED APPROACH THAT FOR DECADES HAS FAILED TO ADVANCE OUR INTERESTS. AND INSTEAD, WE WILL BEGIN TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.
WHAT?
NO, NO!, BAD, BAD NATION. CUBA IS AN UNREPENTANT COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP THAT SPENT DECADES THUMBING ITS NOSE AT AMERICA. WHICH REMINDED ME IT HAS BEEN 4,555 DAYS, DONDE ESTA ELIAN? AND THE PRESIDENT DID THIS, FOLKS. WHEN THE CIA WAS THIS CLOSE TO TAKING DOWN FIDEL CASTRO WITH THE DEADLIEST WEAPON OF ALL. AND OBAMA OH, MAKE NO MISTAKE, OBAMA HAS GOT A WHOLE LOT OF PLANS TO MAKE CUBA MORE LIBRE.
THE SWEEPING CHANGES COME AFTER CUBA RELEASED AN AMERICAN PRISONER ALONG WITH A HIGH LEVEL SPY.
IT TAKES CUBA OFF THE LIST OF TERRORIST STATES, EASES BANKING REGULATIONS
PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO TRAVEL TO CUBA AND BRING BACK CUBAN CIGARS LEGALLY, UP TO $100.
THE U.S. EMBASSY WILL OPEN UP IN HAVANA SO THERE CAN BE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.
Stephen: WE DON'T NEED AN EMBASSY IN HAVANA. WE ALREADY HAVE AN EMBASSY IN CUBA. IT'S CALLED GITMO OF COURSE I CAN'T BLAME ALL OF THIS ON BARACK OBAMA. SOME OF THE BLAME GOES TO POPE-BAMA.
POPE FRANCIS BEHIND THE SCENES HAD WRITTEN LETTERS TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND PRESIDENT CASTRO SEEING AN OPENING HERE. AND THE VATICAN BROKERED A SECRET MEETING BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CUBAN GOVERNMENT.
Stephen: COME ON, FRANK! IS THERE NOTHING THIS LUNATIC WON'T HEAL WITH COMPASSION? NO, I'M SORRY, THAT DOES T I I'M CALLING FOR A TRADE EMBARGO ON VATICAN CITY. AMERICANS WILL JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITHOUT THEIR MAJOR EXPORT, HARLEQUIN SECURITY PANTALOONS. I KNOW, IT'S GOING TO BE HARD. WELL, FOLKS, OBAMA ISN'T GOING TO GET AWAY WITH THIS JUST BECAUSE I'M GOING OFF THE AIR. THE MINUTE MY SHOW ENDS, I'M ON A PLANE TO HAVANA TO PERSONALLY INVESTIGATE THIS TRAVESTY. I WILL GO TO EVERY PRISTINE BEACH. I WILL SCOUT EVERY RUM DISTILLERY AND I DON'T CARE HOW MANY 1957 CHEVIES I HAVE TO BUY FOR $200. UNTIL THE JOB IS DONE, I WILL NOT REST EXCEPT IN A HAMMOCK. WE WILL HAVE MORE COVERAGE ON THIS STORY TOMORROW, OR REALLY NOT ALL ALL WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
