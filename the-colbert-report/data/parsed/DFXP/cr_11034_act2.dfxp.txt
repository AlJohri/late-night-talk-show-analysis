Stephen: WELCOME BACK. YEAH, C'MON! WELCOME BACK! NATION... NATION, AS YOU KNOW, "THE COLBERT REPORT" GOES OFF THE AIR NEXT THURSDAY. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: NO, NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT. NO, NO, NO, NO... SO WHAT THE CRITICS SAID WHEN IT STARTED IS FINALLY TRUE -- IT WON'T LAST MORE THAN A COUPLE WEEKS. (LAUGHTER) FORTUNATELY, THERE'S STILL TIME TO PRAISE ME. IN FACT, THIS MORNING, MY DOCTOR TOLD ME MY CHOLESTEROL WAS OFF THE CHART! (LAUGHTER) THIS IS WHO'S HONORING ME NOW. ♪♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TONIGHT'S HONORING OF ME NOW COMES FROM ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY BECAUSE I'M ON THE COVER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IN FACT, I'M ON THE THREE DIFFERENT COVERS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES, I HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO LEGOLAS GANDALF AND BILBO TO CELEBRATE THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL FILM IN THE HOBBIT TRILOGY -- "THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES." AND I'M DOING THIS FOR A VERY GOOD REASON -- ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO GUESS DRESS UP LIKE MIDDLE EARTH PEOPLE, AND I SAID, "UH, YEAH." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND MY TRANSFORMATION WAS TRULY SOMETHING TO BEHOLD. THESE ARE TIME LAPSES OF ME GETTING INTO COSTUME FOR THE COVER OF ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY. I'M STOKED. ♪♪ OH, GOD, THIS IS PERFECTION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YES, YES!
Stephen: YOU SHALL NOT PASS! EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. YOU THERE ON THE BRIDGE. YOU SHALL NOT PASS, OKAY? READ THE SIGN -- NO PASSING. THANK YOU. I WILL CALL SECURITY IF YOU TRY TO PASS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND INSIDE,  FOLKS THERE ARE MORE AMAZING PHOTOS OF ME  AS THE CHARACTERS IN ACTION SHOTS. LIKE THIS ONE WHERE GANDALF IS AT STARBUCKS. WHAT IS HE DRINKING?
CHAI, YOU FOOLS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THE ISSUE -- THE ISSUE ALSO -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE ISSUE ALSO FEATURES MY INTERVIEW WITH PETER JACKSON WHICH IS CHOCK FULL OF DIRECTORIAL INSIGHT, LIKE WHEN JACKSON SAYS TO ME, "I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT." MY ISSUE HITS THE NEWS STANDS TOMORROW. BUY YOUR COPY TO FIND OUT WHAT I WAS RIGHT ABOUT -- THIS TIME. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
