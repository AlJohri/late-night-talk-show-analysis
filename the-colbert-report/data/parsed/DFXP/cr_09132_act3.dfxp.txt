Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK  CALLED "HOME WRD BOUND: WHY  WOMEN ARE EMBRACING THE NEW DOMESTICITY."  I HOPE SHE APPRECIATES HOW I  SLAVED ALL DAY OVER THESE  QUESTIONS. PLEASE WELCOME EMILY MATCHAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOOD TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE A JOURNALIST. YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT CULTURE. YOU WRITE THE ATLANTIC AND THE  "WASHINGTON POST."  THE HAIR PIN. ALL RIGHT. YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED "HOME  WARD BOUND: WHY WOMEN ARE  EMBRACING THE NEW DOMESTICITY." ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LIKE  TRADITIONAL GENDER ROLES? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING  ABOUT? ARE WE TALKING LIKE 50 SHADES OF  GRAY SITUATION? WE CAN MOVE SOME PAPER RIGHT  NOW.
I'M SORRY. NOT EXACTLY. THE NEW DOMESTICITY IS A SOCIAL  MOVEMENT WHERE REALLY SEEING  YOUNG PEOPLE, WOMEN BUT ALSO MEN, REEMBRACING THESE SORT OF  LOST DOMESTIC ARTS AND  PRACTICES, EVERYTHING FROM KNITTING AND CANNING TO RAISING  CHICKENS IN THEIR BACKYARD.
Stephen: WHY WOULD THEY BE  DOING THIS? YOU CAN GET, I MEAN, CANNING,  YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALMOST NOTHING  CHEAPER THAN A CAN OF FOOD. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND IF IT'S DENTED OR BULGING,  THEY'LL PAY YOU TO TAKE IT AWAY. WHAT IS THE REASON WHY... LET'S  SAY FOR A MOMENT THAT THIS IS A  MOVEMENT. WHAT DO YOU DEFINE BY MOVEMENT? HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO BE  INVOLVED IN IT FOR IT TO BE A  MOVEMENT BECAUSE I THOUGHT, EXCUSE ME, I THOUGHT WOMEN WERE  LEANING IN NOW. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING  THEY'RE LEANING OUT. WHICH WAY ARE WOMEN LEANING OR  ARE YOU SAYING THERE ARE  DIFFERENT TYPES OF WOMEN IN THE  WORLD?
THERE ARE CERTAINLY ARE MANY  TYPES OF WOMEN IN THE WORLD.
Stephen: ARE YOU LEANING IN  OR LEANING OUT?
LEANING IN I THINK WOULD NOT  HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IF EVERYONE  WAS LEANING IN. SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE  TO LEAN IN. WE'RE SEEING PEOPLE ON ALL THESE  DIFFERENT FRONTS. WE'RE SEEING A HUGE INCREASE IN  PEOPLE WHO ARE COOKING AT HOME. THINGS LIKE CANNING IS IS JUST  EXPLODING.
Stephen: DO YOU CAN? MY HUSBAND DOES. Stephen: HE'S THE ONE WHO  WEARS THE SKIRT IN THE FAMILY. NO OFFENSE. I BET HE LOOKS GREAT IN IT.
PICKLES ARE VERY GOOD. Stephen: ALL RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S A LINE FROM 50  SHADES OF GRAY. OH, MY GOD. HIS PICKLES ARE SO GOOD, I THINK  SHE SAID. IS THIS A LIBERAL THING OR A  HIPPY-DIPPY LIKE CRUNCHY GRANOLA  COME EWEN, LOVE BABY, YOU KNOW, LET'S NOT GET MARRIED. LET'S ACTUALLY RAISE CHICKENS  INSTEAD KIND OF? IS IT A LIBERAL THING OR IS IT A  CONSERVATIVE THING? BECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW WHICH  SIDE TO TAKE THERE.
ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING  THINGS ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU HAVE  PEOPLE WHO ARE YOUR TYPICAL LEFT LIBERAL PORTLANDIAN CARICATURES  WHO ARE PICKLING EVERYTHING AND  PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY  CONSERVATIVE. YOU HAVE VERY RELIGIOUS, YOU  KNOW, MORMON HOUSEWIVES IN PROVO  UTAH WHO ARE SELLING CLOTHES ON  ETSY. IT CROSSES ONE OF THESE LINES  WHICH IS WHY I FIND IT  INTERESTING.
IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT  WOMEN ARE STAYING HOME IN THIS  NEW DOMESTICITY IS THAT THERE ARE JUST NO JOBS? YOU CAN CALL IT A MOVEMENT OR  YOU COULD SAY I GOT WAY TOO MUCH  FREE TIME ON MY HANDS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WELL, THAT IS A BIG PART OF  IT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE... THE RECESSION, PEOPLE AREN'T  FINDING JOBS WHEN THEY WANT  THEM. EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE JOBS THEY  MAY NOT BE FULL TIME OR THEY MAY  BE DISSATISFIED WITH THEM. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR OTHER  WAYS TO GET FULFILLMENT.
Stephen: IS THIS A REJECTION  OF LIKE CORPORATISM AT THE SAME  TIME?
I THINK IT IS. I THINK A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT  ARE INVOLVED IN THIS MOVEMENT,  THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT FOOD. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT FACTORY  FARMS. THEY'VE SEEN THE YOUTUBE TUBE  VIDEOS OF ALL THESE CHICKENS IN  THE FACTORY FARMS.
Stephen: WHAT'S WRONG WITH  CORPORATISM? I MEAN, YOU GET TO GO TO WORK  FOR 80 HOURS A WEEK AND WORK  UNDERNEATH FLUORESCENT LIGHTS AND THEN WHEN YOU COME HOME, YOU  HAVE AN HOUR EVERY NIGHT TO WEEP  SILENTLY OVER YOUR SLEEPING  CHILD.
WELL, I THINK A LOT OF THE  PEOPLE IN MY BOOK WHO ARE IN  THEIR 20s OR 30s SAW THEIR PARENTS DOING BASICALLY THAT. THEIR PARENTS ARE THE BABY  BOOMERS. THEY'RE SAYING, NOT THAT THEY  ARE GOING TO ALL DROP OUT OF THE  WORK FORCE AND BE STAY AT HOME PARENTS BUT THAT THEY DON'T WANT  THAT. THEY DON'T WANT THIS 80-HOUR  WORKWEEK AND NOT SPENDING TIME  WITH THEIR FAMILY. IF YOU SURVEY MEMBERS OF  SO-CALLED GEN-Y THEY'RE...
Stephen: WHICH ONE ARE YOU? GEN-Y...
I AM THE OLDEST END OF GEN-Y. Stephen: ME TOO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT
