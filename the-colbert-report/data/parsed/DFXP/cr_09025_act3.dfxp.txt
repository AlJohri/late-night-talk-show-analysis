(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH TONY KUSHNER,  THE AUTHOR OF THE NEW SCREENPLAY  FOR THE MOVIE "LINCOLN." NOW, TONY, SHOULDN'T THEY JUST  MAKE AN OSCAR IN THE SHAPE OF  DANIEL DAY-LEWIS AND GIVE IT TO HIM AT THIS POINT? (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE  HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN IT AND THEY  WANT TO GIVE IT TO HIM. LET'S WATCH A CLIP. THIS IS I BELIEVE LINCOLN AND  THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE WITH SOME  YOUNG MEN DESCRIBING HIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.
RIGHT, HE'S JUST MADE A  DECISION TO ASK GRANT TO PUT  SOME CONFEDERATE COMMISSIONERS ON ICE AS WE'RE BRINGING IT INTO  WASHINGTON BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO  STAY OUT OF THE WAY WHILE HE GETS THE VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT  ORGANIZED
EUCLID'S FIRST COMMON NOTION  IS THIS. THINGS WHICH ARE EQUAL TO THE  SAME THING ARE EQUAL TO EACH  OTHER. THAT'S A RULE OF MATHEMATICAL  REASONING. IT'S TRUE BECAUSE IT WORKS. HAS DONE AND ALWAYS WILL DO. IN HIS BOOK EUCLID SAID THIS IS  SELF-EVIDENT. YOU SEE, THERE IT IS. EVEN IN THAT 2000-YEAR-OLD BOOK  OF MECHANICAL LAW IT IS A  SELF-EVIDENT TRUTH THAT THINGS WHICH ARE EQUAL TO THE SAME  THING ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT'S LINCOLN. (APPLAUSE)  THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR LINCOLN  FROM NOW ON.
I THINK SO. HENRY FONDA WAS REALLY, REALLY  GREAT. 72 YEARS AGO, 79 YEARS AGO. AND I THINK DANIEL IS NOW THE  DEFINITIVE.
Stephen: NAILED IT, HE NAILED  IT. ONE THING THAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT  THIS MOVIE IS THAT THAT'S A  GREAT PORTRAIT OF LINCOLN AND IT'S A HEROIC PORTRAIT OF  LINCOLN AND, YOU KNOW, SPOILER  ALERT, IT ENDS SADLY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THIS HEROIC PORTRAIT WORRIES  ME BECAUSE PEOPLE OFTEN COMPARE  OBAMA TO LINCOLN. DO YOU THINK THERE'S A  COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO?
OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: WHAT? WHAT? THEY'RE BOTH FROM ILLINOIS? WHAT?
BOTH FROM ILLINOIS.
Stephen: SO WAS CAPONE, GO  ON. (LAUGHTER)
I FEEL THAT THE CONNECTION IS  OBAMA A PROGRESSIVE CENTRIST, AS  LINCOLN WAS. THEY BOTH BELIEVE IN GOVERNMENT.
Stephen: LINCOLN WAS A  REPUBLICAN, THOUGH. LINCOLN WAS A REPUBLICAN.
A DIFFERENT KIND OF  REPUBLICAN.
Stephen: STILL, "R" NEXT TO  HIS NAME.
THAT'S THE CASE.
Stephen: AND I DON'T THINK  OBAMA COULD PULL OFF THE LOOK. IN A STOVE PIPE MAT MAYBE, BUT  IF HE HAD THAT BEARD HE'D LOOK  SO MUCH LIKE THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH GUY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  TONY, THANK YOU SO FOR JOINING  ME. TONY KUSHNER. THE MOVIE IS "LINCOLN."  GO SEE IT! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
