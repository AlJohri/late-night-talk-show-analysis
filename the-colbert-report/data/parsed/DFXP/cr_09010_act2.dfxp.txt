STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, TONIGHT, OF COURSE IS  WITHOUT ANY DOUBT IN MY HEART  SURE TO BE MITT ROMNEY'S TRIUMPH  BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION MADE BY  HIS YOUTHFUL WARD PAUL RYAN AND  ON SATURDAY RYAN DID IT AGAIN.
VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE  PAUL RYAN CAME TO NORTHEAST  OHIO. HE VISIT AID SOUP CICH MONEY IN  YOUNGSTOWN. AS THE FAMILY WASHED DISHES AT  THE KITCHEN.
STEPHEN: FORGET ATLAS  SHRUGS THIS WEEKEND ATLAS  SCRUBS. AND HERE IS THE THING, HOW DID  THE CHARITY THANK RYAN? WITH A STEAMING LADLE OF  COMPLAINTS.
THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN IS ON  DEFENSE OVER THIS PAUL RYAN  PHOTO OP AT A SOUP KITCHEN.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHARITY  SAID THE CAMPAIGN QUOTE  RAMRODDED THEIR WAY IN SO RYAN  COULD GET HIS PICTURE TAKEN WHILE WASHING DISHES. THE PHOTO OP THEY DID WAS NOT  ACCURATE. HE DID NOTHING. HE CAME IN HERE TO GET THE  PICTURE TAKEN AT THE DINING  HALL.
STEPHEN: YES, ACCORD  TWOAFGHT PAUL RYAN SHOWED UP FOR  15 MINUTES AT A SOUP KITCHEN  AFTER THE PATRONS HAD LEFT AND WASHED POTS AND PANS THAT DID  NOT APPEAR TO BE DIRTY. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, FOLKS, THAT MAY SOUND  POINTLESS BUT REMEMBER HE'S  RUNNING FOR VICE PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT WASN'T  THE MOST EMBARRASSING PHOTO OF  RYAN WE'VE SEEN LATELY. RYAN IS FOLLOWING HIS BOSSES  LEAD. LAST WEEK MITT PAID A VISIT TO  THE SOUP CICH CHINA IS THE  SPECIAL KITCHEN IN HIS HOUSE  THAT MAKES ONLY SOUP. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S RIGHT NEXT -- IT'S RIGHT  NEXT TO THE SALTINE BAKERY SO  THEY ARE FRESH. [ LAUGHTER ] THE DINING HALL'S COORDINATOR  PILED ON ADDING IT WAS QUOTE THE  PHONIEST PIECE OF BALONEY I'VE  EVER BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH WHICH IS SAYING A LOT CONSIDERING THE  QUALITY OF BALONEY THAT IS  GENERALLY SERVED AT SOUP  KITCHENS. BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S NOTHING TO  SEE HERE, FOLKS. RYAN'S TOWNHALL RAN A LITTLE  LATE SEW MISSED HOMELESS  BREAKFAST. WHAT WAS HE SUPPOSED TO DO  CHARITY ON THE NEEDY SCHEDULE? SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. TAKE ME I'M A BUSY MAN BUT I  LIKE TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED  APPEARING TO HELP OTHERS SO ONCE  A MONTH AFTER THIS SHOW ENDS AT MIDNIGHT I CHUG A FIVE HOUR  ENERGY AND GO TO THE NURSING  HOME AND BREAK OUT OLD ALTO SAX  AND START WAILING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I DON'T WANT TO BRAG BUT I'M  SOMETHING OF A MIRACLE WORKING. SOME OF THEM JUMP OUT THE BED  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS. DON'T FAULT RYAN HERE, FOLKS. I SAY HE IS THE VICTIMMENT AND I  HAVE I MESSAGE FOR THOSE SO  QUICK TO JUDGE THIS GOOD MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] HI I'M STEPHEN COLBERT WITH SAVE  THE CANDIDATES. THIS IS PAUL. SOME DAY HE WANTS IT BE VICE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT HE NEEDS YOUR HELP. FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES A DAY YOU  CAN PROVIDE PAUL WITH THE PHOTO  OPS HE DESPERATELY NEEDS TO LOOK  LIKE HE CARES. ANYTHING YOU GIVE WILL HELP. A HANDFUL OF ORPHANS TO STAND  NEAR. A DISABLED VET TO WAVE AT. EVEN A HOMELESS MAN TO PET. WON'T YOU CALL NOW AND HELP THIS  YOUNG MAN LIVE UP TO HIS DREAMS  OF CUTTING ALL YOUR GOVERNMENT  FUNDING. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
