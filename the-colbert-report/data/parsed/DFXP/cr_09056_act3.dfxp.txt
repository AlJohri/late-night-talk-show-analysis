[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY GUEST IS THE STAR OF SUCH  MOVIES AS "THE SOUND OF MUSIC"  AND "MARY POPPINS." GREAT, ANOTHER ADVOCATE FOR THE  NANNY STATE. [LAUGHTER] PLEASE WELCOME JULIE ANDREWS! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR COMING.
THROILD BE HERE. HOW ARE YOU?
Stephen: I'M WONDERFUL. HOW ARE YOU? YOU LOOK SMASHING.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: LOOK HOW EXCITED  THE PEOPLE ARE TO SEE JULIE  ANDREWS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OF BEING  ON THE STAGE, BEING IN THE  MOVIES, BEING A PERFORMER, ZIT STILL EXCITE YOU TO HEAR A  CROWD?
OF COURSE, IT DOES. WHEN YOU'VE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS  AS LONG AS WE'VE BEEN.
Stephen: RIGHT. RIGHT.
YOU KNOW HOW, IT IS.
Stephen: VERY SIMILAR  CAREER TRAJECTORIES YOU AND I.
RIGHT.
Stephen: DO YOUNG WOMEN  COME UP TO YOU AND SAY THE PARTS  YOU'VE DONE, MARY POPPINS, MARIA, SHAPED THEIR LIVES AND  MADE THEM THINK ABOUT WHAT IT'S  LIKE TO BE A WOMAN?
I THINK THEY SAY THEY WANTED  TO GET INTO THEATER BECAUSE OF  THE ROLES THAT I'VE DONE OR THEY WANTED TO BEGIN TO SING OR GET  INTO THE ARTS IN SOME FASHION. THEY DO AND IT'S VERY, VERY NICE  WHEN THEY DO.
Stephen: IS IT?
YEAH.
Stephen: IS IT HUMBLING OR  DO YOU SAY DAMN STRAIGHT?
IT DEPENDS.
Stephen: ON WHO THE PERSON  IS?
EXACTLY, YES.
Stephen: YOU ARE A DAME  COMMANDER?
YES.
Stephen: IS THAT FUN?
I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT VERY  MUCH.
Stephen: REALLY? SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A TROOP OF  MEN YOU CAN CALL ON TO ATTACK AT  ANY MOMENT.
THAT'S RIGHT. I DO SO LOOK OUT!
Stephen: COULD YOU HAVE ME  KILLED?
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD GO  THAT FAR BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE  WORTHY OF A DAME, YOU  UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND IT'S  ONE NOTCH BELOW 007.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU'VE DONE MANY  THINGS AND NOW YOU ARE IN  CHILDREN'S PUBLISHING. YOU HAVE A SERIES OF BOOKS  CALLINGED THE VERY FAIRY  PRINCESS. THE FIFTH IN THE SERIES, FOR  THOSE OF YOU WAITING IS THE VERY  FAIRY PRINCESS FOLLOWS HER  HEART.
RIGHT.
Stephen: I HAVEN'T FINISHED  IT YET. IT'S A LITTLE ABOVE MY READING  LEVEL IS.
OKAY.
Stephen: I WANT TO THANK  YOU FOR REINTRODUCING THE IDEA  THAT LITTLE GIRLS CAN BE  PRINCESSES.
I THINK I BETTER STOP YOU  RIGHT THERE, STEPHEN BECAUSE  ACTUALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO US, MY DAUGHTER AND TO  ME, WHY PRINCESSES. ISN'T THAT A BAD THING TO BE  TEACHING CHILDREN TO BE?
Stephen: WHY NOT A FAIRY  DEMOCRATY ELECTED LEADER.
THAT WOULD BE FINE, TOO. THIS JUST HAPPENS TO BE ABOUT A  LITTLE GIRL WHO IS CONVINCED  BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN SPARKLE THAT SHE FEELS INSIDE THAT SHE  IS A VERY FAIRY PRINCESS BUT  THAT'S DESPITE THE EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY.
Stephen: IS SHE?
SHE THINKS SHE IS.
Stephen: IS SHE? FEET TO THE FIRE HERE? [LAUGHTER]
BY THE END OF EACH STORY YOU  MIGHT JUST BELIEVE THAT SHE IS. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE THE OUTER  TRAPPINGS. IT'S ABOUT YOUR INDIVIDUALALITY. IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU FEEL INSIDE  AND WHAT YOU GIVE. THESE DAYS, I DON'T KNOW IF  YOU'VE BEEN TAKE NOTE OF  PRINCESSES.
Stephen: OH, VERY POPULAR.
VERY POPULAR.
Stephen: ESPECIALLY WITH  LONG LENS CAMERAS.
WELL, YES. BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GLAMOUR  AND THE CROWN AND THE HANDSOME  PRINCE. IT'S ABOUT THE HARD WORK.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW  PRINCESSES?
I DO, INDEED.
Stephen: WHO DO YOU NO, I?
I KNOW A FEW OF THEM. I USED TO KNOW -- I'M NOT  GETTING INTO THAT.
Stephen: YOU SAID IT'S HARD  WORK.
IT'S HARD WORK.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE HARD  WORK THEY DO?
GO ONLINE. LOOK AT PRINCESSES TODAY.
Stephen: I GOOGLED KATE  MIDDLETON. I SAW THAT PHOTO.
THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE  THAT WORKS VERY HARD INDEED.
Stephen: YOU HEARD ABOUT  RICHARD III?
I DID.
Stephen: SO SORRY.
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT HE  GOT FOUND THOUGH. IT'S AMAZING HE NEVER DID UNTIL  NOW. REALLY THE FACT THAT IT REALLY  IS OR WAS HIM. MIND BOGELLING.
Stephen: A PARKING LOT ALL  THESE YEARS.
ANAGE KNOW MINIMUMMOUS END,  ISN'T IT?
Stephen: THESE BOOKS HAVE  HAPPIER ENDINGS THAN THAT.
YES, THEY DO.
Stephen: YOU DO THESE WITH  YOUR DAUGHTER?
THIS IS THE 27th WE'VE  WRITTEN TOGETHER.
Stephen: FIFTH OF SERIES.
BELIEVE OR NOT THIS IS NUMBER  TWO ON THE CHILDREN'S BEST  SELLER LIST FOR PICTURE BOOKS THIS WEEK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: YOU FAMOUSLY  PLAYED MARIA, YOU PLAYED MARY  POPPINS, WERE YOUR CHILDREN EVER RAISED BY NANNIES?
YES, I DID HAVE SOME NANNIES.
Stephen: WHEN THEY CAME FOR  THE JOB INTERVIEW, DID THEY WALK  IN, SEE YOU AND GO, GREAT!
SADLY, NO. NO.
Stephen: I'VE GOT A  QUESTION FOR YOU, KIDDO, MARY  POPINS IS ON BROADWAY, RIGHT  NOW.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: LET'S SAY YOU WERE  IN THE FRONT ROW. SHE BREAKS HER LEG ON STAGE,  COULD YOU GO UP THERE, TAKE THAT  PART OVER AND ROCK IT? COULD YOU STILL DO THAT?
I'M GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO  ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE  IT'S CLOSING IN A FEW WEEKS. YOU KNOW THAT?
Stephen: YOU DO HAVE TO  ANSWER THE QUESTION. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S CLOSING.
DAMN RIGHT I COULD DO IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, JULIE ANDREWS. "THE VERY FAIRY PRINCESS FOLLOWS  HER HEART."  AND SO SHOULD YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
