(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS RELEASED A NEW LINE OF CHRISTMAS CANDLES. I DIDN'T KNOW JESUS HAD A BIRTHDAY CAKE! PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR RICK SANTORUM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. GREAT TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING MY GUEST TONIGHT.
MY PLEASURE.
Stephen: I APPRECIATE YOU COMING ALONG. I DON'T GET A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ON HERE BECAUSE THEY KNOW I'M GOING TO AGREE WITH THEM THE ENTIRE TIME. EVERYBODY KNOWS FORMER TWO-TERM SENATOR FOR PENNSYLVANIA, USED TO BE IN CONGRESS. YOU WERE ONE OF THE LEADING LIGHTS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RUNNING IN 2012. YOU CAME DAMN CLOSE, SIR. LET'S MAKE SOME NEWS. (LAUGHTER) LET'S MAKE SOME NEWS RIGHT NOW. I AM -- ARE YOU RUNNING IN 2016?
I AM NOT -- SURE.
Stephen: LET'S GET YOU SURE. LET'S GET YOU SURE, OKAY? REMEMBER, THIS IS HOW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WORKS. I DON'T KNOW IF NOW YOU KNOW HOW THE PARTY WORKS BUT THE LAST GUY STANDING AFTER THE NOMINEE IS THE NEXT NOMINEE! YOU KNOW, McCAIN GOT IT AFTER BUSH, OKAY? YOU WERE THE LAST GUY STANDING WHEN YOU LOST TO -- WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE DUDE YOU LOST TO? I FORGET HIS NAME. KIT-KATNY? YOU LOST TO THAT CAT. DON'T THEY OWE IT TO YOU?
YEAH. YEAH. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT, DAMN STRAIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT I LIKED ABOUT YOUR MESSAGE WAS THAT YOU WERE SPEAKING FROM THE HEART. YOU WERE SPEAKING FROM THE SWEATER VESTED HEART. (LAUGHTER) AND THEN -- WHAT IS THIS? OH, NO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH, HELL YEAH! OH, YEAH! YEAH, WE'RE DOING IT. YEAH. YEAH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT, OKAY. YOU REALLY SEEM TO BE APPEALING DIRECTLY TO THE HEART OF NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE TO WIN. (LAUGHTER) WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS ABOUT YOUR MESSAGE THAT PEOPLE MOST RESPONDED TO?
SIMPLICITY. THE POINT YOU JUST MADE. PEOPLE WANT SOMEONE WHO WILL GO OUT HERE -- I TALKED TO PEOPLE HERE TODAY WHO SAID "I DON'T BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING THAT YOU BELIEVE IN BUT I BELIEVE YOU BELIEVE."
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT NEW MOVIE STUD SGLO
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY.
OKAY CO-LIGHT STUDIOS.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU GO FROM SOMEONE WHO IS A CULTURAL WARRIOR CALLING OUT THE CRIMES OF HOLLYWOOD TO BEING PART OF THE PROBLEM? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STOP CURSING THE DARKNESS AND LIGHT A CANDLE AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING ABOUT WHAT HOLLYWOOD IS DOING WE'RE GOING TO MAKE MOVIES THAT REFLECT THE VALUES THAT I THINK A LOT OF AMERICANS STILL HOLD AND BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR COUNTRY TO DO WELL GOING FORWARD.
Stephen: YOU GOT A NEW MOVIE. YEAH, GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT UP FOR GOING FORWARD. THE NEW MOVIE IS CALLED "THE CHRISTMAS CANDLE." AND IT'S A STORY OF A TOWN WITH A SET OF MIRACULOUS CANDLES.
NO, NOT REALLY.
Stephen: WHAT?
NOT REALLY.
Stephen: THERE'S NO MIRACULOUS CANDLE?
WELL, THERE'S A CANDLE THAT HAVE BEEN BLESSED. EVERY 25 YEARS AN ANGEL COMES TO THIS TOWN AND BLESSES THE CANDLE.
Stephen: JUST LIKE IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE.
NOT EXACTLY. NOT EXACTLY. BUT THIS CANDLE WAS GIVEN TO SOMEONE WHO IS IN NEED IN THE COMMUNITY AND A MIRACLE HAPPENS ON CHRISTMAS EVE TO THAT FAMILY. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL STORY AND NOW --.
Stephen: SO IT'S NOT A MIRACULOUS AND CAN?
WELL, THE CANDLE IS NOT MIRACULOUS BUT THE PRAYER THAT IS SAID -- THEY GIVE THE INSTRUCTIONS, LIGHT IT AND PRAY. SO NOT THE CANDLE THAT GIVES THE MIRACLE BUT THE PRAYER. AN ANSWER TO PRAYER THAT IS THE MIRACLE.
Stephen: I CAN ACCEPT THAT. I CAN ACCEPT THAT.
WE'RE NOT -- IT'S NOT LIKE VOODOO STUFF. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: MIRACULOUS CANDLE ISN'T VOODOO, IT'S CHANUKAH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'RE BOTH CATHOLICS. YOU'RE PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS CATHOLIC POLITICIAN, I'M THE MOST FAMOUS CATHOLIC ON TELEVISION. CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE HISPANIC VOTE FOR A SECOND? THEY'RE CATHOLICS, WHY CAN'T CONSERVATIVES REACH OUT TO THE HISPANICS? (APPLAUSE) FOR PETE'S SAKE, THE POPE IS AN HISPANIC NOW. DOESN'T THAT KIND OF MAKE US HISPANIC OURSELVES?
WHAT.
Stephen: BY THE TRANSITIVE PROPERTY OF ALL THINGS?
WELL, HE'S THE HOLY FATHER.
CAN WE REACH OUT TO THEM ON SOCIAL ISSUES?
ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID WITH THE REPUBLICANS WHO SAY THEY WANT TO ABANDON THESE ISSUES. THE WAY WE CAN REACH OUT TO A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE MINORITY POPULATION IS THROUGH SOCIAL ISSUES, IS THROUGH ISSUES WHERE THERE IS COMMON AGREEMENT ON THOSE BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE? WE'RE LOSING THIS ONE, AREN'T WE? WE'VE GOT 15 STATES PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WHO ARE RIDING THE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, DON'T GET ME WRONG. DON'T GET ME WRONG. I'M ANGRY, TOO. WE'VE GOT 15 STATES PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RIDING THE RAINBOW TRAIN TO HELL TUNE. (LAUGHTER) HASN'T THIS ONE SLIPPED AWAY FROM US?
I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM HERE IS MARRIAGE HAS SLIPPED AWAY FROM US. MARRIAGE HAS DEINVOLVED INTO JUST A PRO MAN TICK RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT MARRIAGE IS.
Stephen: IT'S FOR TRANSFERRING PROPERTY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU 1%ERS DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: I'VE READ THE OLD TESTAMENT.
MARRIAGE IS MORE THAN THAT AND HETEROSEXUALS HAVE LOST THE DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO SEE, WELL, THIS IS ALL MARRIAGE IS TODAY AND SO WE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THAT. AND SO I THINK THE BETTER DEBATE IS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT NARJ IS AND RECLAIM THE INSTITUTION AS A MAN AND A WOMAN COMING TOGETHER TO HAVE CHILDREN AND RAISE THEM A WAY THAT CONTINUES SOCIETY.
Stephen: WHAT IF WE CUT BAIT ON IT? WHAT IF WE JUST SAY IT'S A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S GONE TO SEED WE JUST LEAVE THE KEYS TO MARRIAGE OUT FRONT AND WE GO GET SOMETHING BETTER? (LAUGHTER) GAYS YOU CAN HAVE MARRIAGE BECAUSE AT THIS POINT MARRIAGE KIND OF SEEMS GAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) REAL GAY. WE GO GET SOMETHING BETTER.
WELL, THAT'S THE ARGUMENT I'M MAKING. THE ARGUMENT I'M MAKING IS WE HAVE TO CLAIM WHAT MARRIAGE IS.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT.
I JUST SAID BEFORE.
Stephen: I WASN'T LISTENING. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S THE UNION OF A MAN AND A WOMAN FOR THE PURPOSES OF HAVING AND RAISING CHILDREN AND CONTINUING SOCIETY. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT AND IT'S MORE THAN JUST -- IT IS ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT.
Stephen: BUT WHAT IS IT NOT? BECAUSE YOU FAMOUSLY ONCE SAID "IT'S NOT MAN ON CHILD, MAN ON DOG, OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE." (LAUGHTER) IS IT DOG ON DOG, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE -- THAT'S THE QUOTE.
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.
Stephen: OH, REALLY? CONTEXTUALIZE ME.
CONTEXTUALIZING IT IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A RELATIONSHIP THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF SOCIETY AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON.
Stephen: I'VE HEARD SOME DISTURBING NEWS THAT GAY PEOPLE HAVE CHILDREN. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'VE HEARD SOME PLACES THEY CAN EVEN ADOPT CHILDREN.
YEAH. HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT. EVERY CHILD HAS THE RIGHT TO THEIR NATURAL MOTHER AND FATHER. EVERY CHILD HAS A NATURAL MOTHER AND FATHER AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO THOSE MOTHERS AND -- THAT MOTHER AND FATHER TO GIVE THEM WHAT ONLY A MOTHER AND ONLY A FATHER CAN GIVE.
WHAT IF THEY DON'T A MOTHER OR A FATHER? WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER FOR THEM TO HAVE NO PARENTS THAN TO BE LOVED BY TWO GAY PEOPLE? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THE POINT OF THE LAW IS TO ENCOURAGE WHAT IS BEST, RIGHT? IT'S TO SET A STANDARD FOR WHAT IS BEST, NOT TO SET A STANDARD SHORT OF WHAT HAVE IS BEST BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU'LL GET LESS THAN WHAT IS NECESSARY.
Stephen: SO WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVIE IN SOMETHING THAT CAN APPEAL TO CONSERVATIVES LIKE A CHRISTMAS MOVIE WHERE RUDOLPH'S NOSE IS BRIGHT ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE CAN EXERCISE THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS EASIER? (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
NOT THERE YET.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK WITH ECHO LIGHT STUDIOS. SENATOR RICK SANTORUM. THE MOVIE
