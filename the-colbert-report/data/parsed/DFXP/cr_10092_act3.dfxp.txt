Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST IS PULITZER PRIZE WINNING COLUMNIST GEORGE WILL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GEORGE! GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN! THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK! NICE TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW. OF COURSE, THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DO NOT KNOW YOU'RE A PULITZER PRIZE WINNING COLUMNIST, PUBLISHED OVER 500 NEWSPAPERS WORLDWIDE. YOU'RE A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR NOW. HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?
LOVE IT.
Stephen: YOU WORKED ABC FOR YEARS, NOW FOX NEWS. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
FOX NEWS IS LIKE GETTING ON A SOUTHWEST AIRLINES PLANE. EVERYBODY'S HAPPY, AT THE TOP OF THE HEAP AND FEEL LIKE INSURGENTS.
Stephen: WOW. THAT'S GREAT. SOUNDS ALMOST DANGEROUS (LAUGHTER) YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED A NICE LITTLE PLACE ON THE NORTH SIDE, WRIGLEY FIELD AT 100. WHY WRITE A BOOK ABOUT WRIGLEY FIELD? YOU'RE A CUBS FAN.
YES.
Stephen: DO YOU LOVE THE CUBS OR IS IT SORT OF AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP YOU CAN'T GET YOURSELF OUT OF RIGHT NOW?
I'M AFRAID IF I STOP, THEY'LL START WINNING.
Stephen: OH, LIKE THE CUBS ARE A SLOT MACHINE THAT YOU'VE WARMED UP.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: FOR 106 YEARS. THEY'VE GOT TO PAY OFF EVENTUALLY.
TURNS OUT THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T HAVE TO.
Stephen: FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN AT WRIGLEY FIELD, I USED TO LIVE ON ADDISON AT BROADWAY AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT WRIGLEY FIELD?
THE SHEER AGE OF IT. WHEN IT OPENED 100 YEARS AGO ON APRIL 23rd, 1914, WE KNOW THAT THERE HAD TO BE CIVIL WAR VETERANS IN THE STANDS. PEOPLE FROM GETTYSBURG, SHILOH, CHANCELLORSVILLE --
Stephen: WHY DO WE KNOW THEY HAD TO BE THERE?
IT WAS A REQUIREMENT.
Stephen: FOR OPENING GAME? RIGHT.
Stephen: LIKE BAT DAY OR QUARTER BEER, IT'S TAKE A CIVIL WAR VETERAN HOME DAY?
EXACTLY RIGHT.
Stephen: SO THE AGE OF IT IS GREAT. I LOVE THINGS THAT ARE OLD. I'M CONSERVATIVE, YOU'RE CONSERVATIVE. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING SHOULD EVER CHANGE. DO YOU THINK THAT WRIGLEY FIELD --
THAT MAKES YOU A LIBERAL.
Stephen: THAT NOTHING SHOULD CHANGE?
YES.
Stephen: I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. CONSERVATIVES WANT TO CONSERVE THINGS. I KNOW YOU'RE A WORD SMITH -- BUT WHY DO WANT LIBERALS THINGS TO STAY THE SAME?
IN 1935, SOCIAL SECURITY -- DO YOU DRIVE A 1935 CAR?
Stephen: NO, I DRIVE A TESLA.
I'M SURE YOU DO.
Stephen: YEAH, I DO. DO YOU WATCH A 1935 TELEVISION SET?
Stephen: NO, A 1935 TELEVISION SET, I THINK WAS A POTATO FIELD.
THE SOCIAL SECURITY LIBERALS BELIEVE THINGS SHOULD HAVE GONE JUST AS IT ALWAYS HAS.
Stephen: SO WE SHOULD GET RID OF SOCIAL SECURITY?
NO.
Stephen: I SHOULD. AM I MORE OF A CONSERVATIVE THAN YOU ARE?
YES.
Stephen: OKAY. I WAS TRYING TO LEAD YOU INTO A FIELD WHERE OLD PEOPLE WOULD SHOOT YOU IN THE HEAD. WHAT IS IT -- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WENT TO A GAME THERE?
TWO WEEKS AGO.
Stephen: DID THEY WIN? NOT EXACTLY.
Stephen: REALLY? HOW CLOSE TO WINNING DID THEY COME?
THEY SCORED.
Stephen: THEY SCORED? OH, THAT'S REALLY GOOD. I LOVE IT THERE.
18 INNINGS IN YANKEE STADIUM A WEEK AGO AND DIDN'T SCORE.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK WRIGLEY FIELD, IT'S SUCH A LOVELY PLACE TO BE. YOU HAVE THE HAND-LETTERED SCOREBOARD, THE IVY-COLORED WALLS, YOU'VE GOT VOMIT ON CLARK STREET -- DO YOU THINK IF IT WASN'T SO NICE THAT THE CUBS WOULD WIN MORE?
IT IS THE CASE THAT P.K. WRIGLEY, THE SON OF THE WRIGLEY AFTER WHOM THE BALLPARK IS NAMED, DECIDED WHEN HE INHERITED THE TEAM, THE TEAM IS TERRIBLE, THE BALLPARK IS BEAUTIFUL, LET'S GET PEOPLE COME TO SEE THE BALLPARK. THE GRASS WILL BE SO GREEN AND THE IVY SO LUSH AND THE SUNSHINE SO WARM AND THE BEER SO COLD PEOPLE WON'T CARE WHAT THE SCOREBOARD SAYS. AND FOR A WHILE THEY DID THAT.
Stephen: AND PEOPLE CARE NOW?
THEY CARE ENOUGH.
Stephen: ARE PEOPLE NOT GOING TO GAMES AT WRIGLEY FIELD ANYMORE?
OH, THEY'RE GOING.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE PROBLEM, GEORGE?
THE PROBLEM --
Stephen: WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A NICE PLACE TO GO AND SPEND AN AFTERNOON BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT GOING AND GETTING DRUNK AND OCCASIONALLY A BASEBALL GAME HAPPENS THERE. IT'S BEEN SINCE 1908 SINCE THEY WON THE WORLD SERIES. YOU DON'T GO THERE TO WATCH BASEBALL. YOU GO THERE TO MEET FRIENDS.
1908 IS TWO YEARS BEFORE TOLSTOY DIED.
Stephen: WAS TOLSTOY A WHITE SOX FAN? I DON'T UNDERSTAND (LAUGHTER)
YOU CAN MEET VERY INTERESTING PEOPLE AT WRIGLEY FIELD. THEY HAD A VENDOR THERE WHO TRIED TO CHEAT THE FANS. HIS NAME WAS JACK RUBINSTEIN. MOVED TO DALLAS, CHANGED HIS NAME TO JACK RUBY AND SHOT LEE HARVEY OSWALD.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND -- IF THE CUBS HAD BEEN A BETTER TEAM AND GIVEN MORE BUSINESS TO JACK RUBINSTEIN, WE'D KNOW WHO SHOT KENNEDY?
WE KNOW WHO SHOT KENNEDY.
Stephen: WAKE UP! COME ON, GEORGE! YOU BUY THAT SINGLE BULLET THEORY?
I DO.
Stephen: WE JUST GOT FROM WRIGLEY FIELD TO THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION. THAT'S THE COLBERT REPORT" PROMISE. >>BUT THE CUBS WON THE COLD WAR.
Stephen: IF YOU CAN PROVE THE CUBS WON THE COLD WAR, I'LL PERSONALLY ENDORSE THIS BOOK. RIGHT NOW. IT COULD HAPPEN.
IN 1919 WILLIAM WRIGLEY BOUGHT CATALINA OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE CUBS BEGAN TO TRAIN THERE. IN '37 A DES MOINES, IOWA BROADCASTER KNOWN AS DUTCH REAGAN DECIDED HE WOULD COVER SPRING TRAINING FOR HIS RADIO STATION. TOOK A MOVIE TEST WITH WARNER BROTHERS, BECAME AN ACTOR, BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND WON THE COLD WAR. THEREFORE, THE CUBS GET CREDIT FOR WINNING THE COLD WAR. (CHEERING)
Stephen: BY THAT SAME LOGIC, DID NOT THE CHICAGO CUBS ALSO SELL ARMS TO IRAN? (LAUGHTER) GEORGE WILL, I PERSONALLY ENDORSE A NICE LITTLE PLACE ON THE NORTH SIDE, THAT'S THE COLBERT BUMP, GO GET IT. WE'LL BE BACK. THANK YOU, GEORGE!
