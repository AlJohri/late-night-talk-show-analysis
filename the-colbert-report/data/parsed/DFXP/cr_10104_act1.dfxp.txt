( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS-- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW-- AND I HOPE YOU DO-- YOU KNOW THAT I AM AMERICA'S MOST PROMINENT CATHOLIC. MY FAITH IS SO STRONG, DOCTORS HAVE ACTUALLY CALLED IT A MESSIAH COMPLEX. ( LAUGHTER ) NOT TOO SHABBY. BUT I'M ALSO AMERICA'S FOREMOST CAPITALIST. I LOVE THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET SO MUCH I LET IT GET TO THIRD BASE, WHICH IS WHY I HAD PROBLEMS WITH POPE FRANCIS WHEN HE CALLED CAPITALISM A NEW TYRANNY CAUSED BY THE IDOLATRY OF MONEY. IDOLATRY! I WOULD NEVER WORSHIP MONEY. THE DOLLAR IS NOT WORTH THE PAPER IT'S PRINTED ON. THAT'S WHY I'VE INVESTED EVERYTHING IN GOLDEN CALF FUTURES. ( LAUGHTER ) AS A CATHOLIC, I TRY TO GIVE THE POPE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. SO DOES BILL O'REILLY.
THE FAR LEFT IS DISTORTING HIS WORDS, TRYING TO CO-OPT THE POPE TO IMPOSE SO-CALLED ECONOMIC JUSTICE, WHICH IS REALLY SOCIALISM, FORCEFULLY TAKING FROM THE HAVES AND GIVING TO THE HAVE-NOTS. I CAN TELL YOU WITH CERTAINTY THAT POPE FRANCIS OPPOSES THAT FORM OF TYRANNY AS MUCH AS THE POLISH POPE JOHN PAUL DID.
Stephen:  OKAY, PAPA BEAR KNOWS WHAT'S IN POPE-A BEAR'S HEART. NO REDISTRIBUTION, NO SOCIALISM.
BREAKING NEWS, POPE FRANCIS CALLED FOR GOVERNMENTS TO REDISTRIBUTE WEALTH TO THE POOR. IF YOU'RE SAYING TAKE IT FROM HERE, GIVE IT TO THERE, EXPROPRIATE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS BUT SOCIALISM.
Stephen:  SON OF A BISHOP! THE POPE IS A SOCIALIST! I MEAN, IN RETROSPECT, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. HE LIVES IN EUROPE AND HE GIVES HIS EMPLOYEES A ONE-DAY WORK WEEK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HE CAN'T DO THIS. BECAUSE EITHER THE POPE IS WRONG OR GOD'S A COMMIE. ( LAUGHTER ) WAIT A SECOND-- COME TO THINK OF IT, HE DOES LOOK AN AWFUL LOT LIKE KARL MARX. PLUS, JESUS WAS A CARPENTER. THAT'S WHY HE'S HOLDING A HAMMER, BUT, JIMMY, WHAT'S  IN HIS OTHER HAND? A SICKLE! NO! ( APPLAUSE ) NO, NO, NO. I REFUSE. THIS CANNOT BE RIGHT. I MEAN, WHERE IS IT WRITTEN THAT I CAN'T LOVE BOTH GOD AND MONEY? I MEAN BESIDES IN MATTHEW WHERE JESUS SAYS YOU CANNOT SERVE GOD AND MONEY. ( LAUGHTER ) I GUESS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CHOOSE, MONEY OR JESUS. I GUESS I'LL FLIP A COIN. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE YOU HAVE IT. IT CAME UP MONEY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NATION, THE WORLD IS AGHAST AT THE HORRIFIC SITUATION IN NIGERIA. AFTER THE KIDNAPPING LAST MONTH OF MORE THAN 300 SCHOOL GIRLS, BY THE ISLAMIST TERRORIST GROUP BOKO HARAM. OUT OF DESPERATION, LOCAL ACTIVISTS STARTED THE TWITTER HASHTAG #BRINGBACKOURGIRLS, IN ORDER TO PLEAD FOR INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO RESCUE THE GIRLS BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS HAD GIVEN UP ON NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS SHOCKING-- EVIDENTLY, NIGERIA HAS A GOVERNMENT. I KNEW THEY HAD A PRINCE. I KEEP E-MAILING HIM MONEY. WHY DOESN'T HE DO SOMETHING? ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT STARTED AS A HASHTAG HAS BECOME A MOVEMENT.
#BRINGBACKOURGIRLS HAS BECOME A WORLDWIDE SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH MORE THAN A MILLION TWEETS BEING PUBLISHED USING THE HASHTAG.
THE INTERNATIONAL OUTCRY CENTERS ON A TWITTER HASHTAG APPROPRIATELY TITLED #BRINGBACKOURGIRLS.
#BRINGBACKOURGIRLS HAS NOW BEEN USED OVER A MILLION TIMES.
Stephen:  FOLKS, IT'S REFRESHING TO SEE THE WORLD GET BEHIND A HASHTAG CAMPAIGN THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FIRING ME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NORMALLY-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, I LOVE INTERNET MEMES. AFTER ALL, THE WORD "MEME" IS JUST THE WORD "ME" TWICE. AND THIS ONE IS HUGE. EVEN MICHELLE OBAMA JUMPED ON THE HASH-TWAGON. BUT I CANNOT GET BEHIND THIS TWITTER CAMPAIGN BECAUSE NONE OF MY FRIENDS ARE INTO IT.
THIS PICTURE IS OF THE FIRST LADY. I JUST THINK THIS IS PATHETIC.
DO SOMETHING REAL, FOLKS, NOT JUST SIT HERE AND THINK HOLDING SIGNS IS THE SAME AS ACTIONS.
DO YOU THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT HELPING THE PEOPLE WHO TWEET THE HASHTAG FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEMSELVES?
EXACTLY THAT. IT'S AN EXERCISE IN SELF-ESTEEM. ARE THESE BARBARIANS IN THE WILDS OF NIGERIA SUPPOSED TO CHECK THEIR TWITTER ACCOUNT AND SAY UH-OH. MICHELLE OBAMA IS CROSS WITH US. WE BETTER CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR.
Stephen:  YES, TERRORISTS IN THE WILD ARE NOT ON TWITTER. THEY'RE UP TO NASTY BUSINESS. OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE USING SNAP CHAT. BESIDES, YOU DO NOT LAUNCH A TWITTER CAMPAIGN TO RESCUE KIDNAPPED DAUGHTERS. YOU SEND IN LIAM NEESON. HASHTAG PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS. ALL THE TWEET BRIGADE IS DOING IS RAISING GLOBAL AWARENESS OF THESE KIDNAPPED GIRLS. HERE TO RAISE MORE GLOBAL AWARENESS OF THESE KIDNAPPED GIRLS IS HUMANITARIAN ACTIVIST AND SUBJECT OF THE BOOK "SEWING HOPE," SISTER ROSEMARY NYIRUMBE. THANK YOU, ROSEMARY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ALL RIGHT, TONE IT DOWN. TONE IT DOWN, SISTER. YOU'RE A HOLY WOMAN. HERE'S THE BOOK YOU'RE THE SUBJECT OF, "SEWING HOPE." THERE'S ALSO A DOCUMENTARY THAT GOES WITH IT. YOU ARE A DIRECTOR OF ST. MONICA'S TAILORING CENTER IN UGANDA. YOU'RE A DIRECTOR OF THE ST. MONICA SINCE 2001. YOU WERE A CNN HERO IN 2007. LISTED BY "TIME" MAGAZINE AS ONE OF THE 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND YOU WORK WITH THESE YOUNG WOMEN WHO WERE ABDUCTED, TRYING TO GIVE THEM NEW LIVES. IS HASHTAG ACTIVISM A GOOD THING OR BAD THING?
IT IS THE BEST WE CAN DO, AND WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH. WE SHOULD CONTINUE SHOUTING, AS I SAY. WE MUST SHOUT, "BRING BACK OUR GIRLS."
Stephen:  HOW OFTEN DOES THIS HAPPEN?
IT HAPPENS VERY OFTEN. BUT WE KEEP SILENT ABOUT IT. THE WORLD IS SILENT ABOUT THIS. IT HAPPENS ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM.
Stephen:  THEN WHY ARE WE HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT THIS SITUATION?
WE ARE HEARING MUCH BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN AND WE REMAIN SILENT ABOUT IT. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE REMINDING PEOPLE, REMINDING WE HAVE TO SHOUT ABOUT IT AND BRING AN END TO IT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT SO, A LOT OF-- ALL RIGHT. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE PEOPLE CAN DO OTHER THAN THE HASHTAG CAMPAIGN? WHAT CAN THEY DO TO HELP? I THINK THE MORE WE SHOUT THE BETTER. AND I ALSO SAY WE MUST BE PRESENT IN EVERY SITUATION. IT IS VERY PAINFUL, BUT IF WE ARE NOT THERE, IF WE PRETEND WE ARE NOT LISTENING, IT WILL CONTINUE.
Stephen:  IF WE PRETEND WE'RE NOT LISTENING, IT WILL CONTINUE.
IT WILL CONTINUE.
Stephen:  WHAT IF WE DON'T PRETEND. WHAT IF WE REALLY JUST DON'T LISTEN? HEAR ME OUT. BECAUSE IT MAKES ME SAD, OKAY, AND IT'S HAPPENING IN AFRICA, WHICH IS A LONG WAY AWAY. HOW DOES THAT AFFECT MY LIFE? WHY SHOULD I BE SAD FOR SOMETHING HAPPENING THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY WHEN THERE ARE THINGS AT HOME TO BE SAD ABOUT?
IF YOU CANNOT BE SAD BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING IN AFRICA, WHICH IT IS PART OF THE HUMANITY, I WILL FEEL LIKE JABBING YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  REALLY?
YES.
Stephen:  REALLY?
YES.
Stephen:  SO YOU, A NUN WOULD PUNCH ME?
OH, YEAH. I WOULD. LI.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT. AM I ALLOWED TO PUNCH YOU BACK?
NO.
Stephen:  NO?
NO.
Stephen:  HOW IS THAT FAIR?
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO PUNCH YOU, AND I WILL WIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  BARACK OBAMA SAYS HE WANTS THE UNITED STATES TO HELP IN THE SEARCH FOR THESE GIRLS. WHAT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL-- DRONES, MISSILES, TROOPS ON THE GROUND? WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING?
YOU KNOW, ANY PEACEFUL WAY. I WOULD OPT MORE THE PEACEFUL WAY ALWAYS, YOU KNOW.
Stephen:  OTHER THAN PUNCHING ME IN THE FACE. ( LAUGHTER )
WELL, YOU KNOW,.
Stephen:  YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE.
LISTEN TO ME-- PUNCHING YOU IS THE MOST PEACEFUL WAY FOR ME NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELL, SISTER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STOPPING BY. SISTER ROSEMARY NYIRUMBE. THE BOOK IS "SEWING HOPE." BRING BACK OUR GIRLS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
