Stephen: WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU, FOLKS. NATION, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW  YOU KNOW I LIKE TO KEEP UP WITH  THE LATEST TRENDS. I KNOW WHAT'S ALL THE RAGE  BECAUSE I AM "ALL" RAGE. I GOTS THE SCOOP.
DY SCOOP ON WHAT'S HIPPITY  HOOP. I MEAN I WAS PLANKING WAY BEFORE  IT WAS COOL LIKE EIGHT HOURS A  NIGHT. AND I'VE ALWAYS GOT MY LOOK  HOLES -- THAT'S WHAT KIDS CALL  THE EYES THESE DAYS -- PEELED FOR THE LATEST TREND IN  PARENTING. AND THE "NEW YORK TIMES"  RECENTLY FEATURED A FANTASTIC  NEW FAD IN CHILD REARING. GOING DIAPERLESS. TO PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENT FROM  THE RAVAGES OF DISPOSABLE  DIAPERS, PREVENT DIAPER RASH, REDUCE THE LAUNDERING OF CLOTH  DIAPERS AND TO FEEL MORE IN  TOUCH WITH THEIR BABIES' MOST INTIMATE FUNCTIONS AND NOTHING  MAKES YOU FEEL MORE "IN TOUCH"  WITH YOUR BABY'S MOST INTIMATE FUNCTIONS THAN SCRAPING IT OUT  OF YOUR SHOES. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. PARENTS LISTEN FOR NOISES THEIR  BABIES MAKE WHILE URINATING OR  DEFECATING. THEN THE NEXT TIME THEY HEAR IT,  PARENTS MAKE THEIR OWN NOISE  LIKE A SSSS OR A GRUNTING AND EVENTUALLY THEY CAN HOLD THEIR  BABY OVER A TOILET OR A SINK,  GRUNT FOR ABOUT 20 SECONDS AND THE BABY GOES TO THE BATHROOM. PRETTY NEAT. ALSO, LETTING YOUR BABY DROP  SOME HEAT IN THE SINK IS A GREAT  WAY TO GET THE LADIES ROOM TO YOURSELF AT BARNES AND NOBLE. NOW THE TIMES ARTICLE -- YOU'RE  GOING TO LIKE THIS -- THE TIMES  ARTICLE ALSO CHRONICLES A PARENT WHO LEFT LITTLE BOWLS AROUND THE  HOUSE TO CATCH HER DAUGHTER'S  OFFERINGS. AND I CANNOT THINK OF A DOWN  SIDE TO CONDITIONING YOUR CHILD  TO PEE IN BOWLS EXCEPT IF YOU EVER PLAN TO TAKE THEM TO A  POTTERY BARN. NOW, FOLKS, THIS WHOLE EXCITING  NEW METHOD IS KNOWN AS  ELIMINATION COMMUNICATION BECAUSE IF YOU LET YOUR KID PEE  IN BOWLS AROUND THE HOUSE, YOU  WILL ELIMINATE ALL COMMUNICATION WITH FRIENDS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). BUT SURPRISINGLY, THE SYSTEM IS  NOT PERFECT. DIAPER-FREE PARENTS COMPLAIN  THAT THEY STILL NEED TO RELY ON  DIAPERS OVERNIGHT. FOLKS, I WANT TO HELP. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I AM PROUD TO  INTRODUCE A WAY TO LET YOUR BABY  GO DIAPER FREE ALL NIGHT LONG. IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT'S KIDDIE  LITTER. SIMPLY LINE THE BOTTOM OF  JUNIOR'S CRIB WITH AT LEAST FOUR  INCHES OF MY PAT PENITENTIARIED PEE PEE-PELLETS. THEN IN THE MORNING, SCOOP AWAY  THE OFFERINGS. AND BRAVO, "NEW YORK TIMES," FOR  REPORTING ON THIS NEW TREND OF  CLEANING UP ACCIDENTS. ALTHOUGH I THINK I'LL STICK WITH  MY OLD METHOD: PICKING THEM UP  WITH THE "NEW YORK TIMES." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
