[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK  OUT. PLEASE WELCOME KENNETH  GOLDSMITH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR COMING  ON.
SO HAPPY TO BE HERE. tephen: LATER WE'LL PLAY  SOME DIXIELAND JAZZ OR CHURN  SOME FRESH BUTTER MILK ICE CREAM OR RECITE SOME POETRY. WE COULD DO THAT NOW.
WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER. Stephen: WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO START WITH?
I DON'T KNOW. HOW ABOUT OLD SUSANNAH.
Stephen: I HAD MYSELF A DREAM  THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN EVERYTHING  WAS STILL. I DREAMED I SAW MY GIRL COMING  AROUND THE HILL. BUCKWHEAT CAKE WAS IN HER MOUTH  AND A TEAR IN HER EYES. I SAID I COME FROM DIXIELAND. SUSANNAH, DON'T YOU CRY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU ARE THE POET LAUREATE. Stephen: OF THE MUSEUM OF  MODERN ART. YOU HAVE TEN BOOKS OF POETRY. YOU TEACH WRITING AT THE  UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED  AMERICAN DEATH AND DISASTER. DID YOU WRITE THIS?
ABSOLUTELY NOT. I NEVER WRITE ANY OF MY BOOKS.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY  WRITE THIS. YOU COLLECTED IT?
I TRANSCRIBED IT. Stephen: BECAUSE THIS BOOK  ITSELF IS ACTUALLY  TRANSCRIPTIONS OF REAL-TIME  REPORTING OF DEATHS AND DISASTERS AS THEY HAPPEN IN THE  UNITED STATES.
ABSOLUTELY. Stephen: YOU START OFF WITH  J.F.K.
ABSOLUTELY. Stephen: IT'S A LITTLE RADIO  STATION IN DALLAS.
K.L.I.F. Stephen: THAT'S DALLAS' NEWS  LEADER. IT'S JUST A WARNING IN 1963. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING A  NICE TURKEY. WE'RE TALKING NOVEMBER 22 HERE. SLOWLY IT DAWNS ON THIS GUY THAT  THIS LITTLE SHOOTING DOWNTOWN  TURNED INTO ONE OF OUR GREATEST NATIONAL TRAGEDIES. WHY DID YOU WANT US TO HEAR  EVERY WORD OF THIS?
THE RADIO SOUNDED DIFFERENT  BACK THEN THAN IT DOES NOW. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS THROUGHOUT  THE BOOK. EVERY TRANSCRIPTION HAS A MARK  ON IT. THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL SORT OF  FANTASY TIME THAT IS PUNCTUATED  BY AN ASSASSINATION OR A SHOOTING AT THAT POINT OF A  PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, IT SHATTERS THE ENTIRE  ILLUSION OF PRE-THNGS GIVING  HOLIDAYS. THESE GUYS THAT ARE BROADCASTING  THIS ARE NOT PREPARED IN ANYWAY  FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. SUDDENLY THEY ARE IMPROVISING,  RIDING BY THE SEAT OF THEIR  PANTS AND MAKING IT UP. THIS HAPPENS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND  AGAIN. ONE CHAPTER OF THIS BOOK ABOUT  THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IS  REMARKABLE BECAUSE THERE ARE MORNING SHOCK JOCK GUYS GOING  INTO TO WORK FIGURING THEY'RE  GOING TO DO THEIR SCHTICK AND THEN A PLANE GOES INTO A  BUILDING. THEY'RE STUCK IN THE STUDIO  NARRATING SOMETHING THAT THEY  HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. HOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE IT UP AS  THEY GO ALONG. WHAT'S AMAZING TO ME IS THAT  THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF  BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT 9/11. TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NOBODY WENT TO  LISTEN TO THE WAY THOSE EVENTS  WERE DESCRIBEDDED.
Stephen: MAYBE THEY LISTENED  TO IT BUT THEN THEY DID  ADDITIONAL WORK.
BUT THAT WORK... ARTISTS ARE  DUMB.
Stephen: ARTISTS ARE DUMB? WE DO THINGS THAT YOU  SHOULDN'T DO. WHAT I'M DOING IS TOO EASY FOR  INVESTIGATIVE REPORTERS TO DO. BY DOING SOMETHING THAT IS THAT  SIMPLE, WE'RE UNCOVERING  SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS ACTUALLY EVER THOUGHT OF. THE POETIC QUALITY OF WHAT WAS  UNFURLING LINGUISTICALLY AT THAT  MOMENT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE SEVEN OF  THESE. REPORTING ON THE DEATH IN  REALTIME OF J.F.K., R.F.K., JOHN  LENNON, THE COLUMBINE TRAGEDY, SEPTEMBER 11, THE CHALLENGER  DISASTER AND MICHAEL JACKSON'S  DEATH. ALL THESE THINGS, THESE SEVEN  DIFFERENT EVENTS, WE KNOW WHAT  IS HAPPENING WHEN WE READ THIS. THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST LIVING  THEIR LIVES THINKING IT'S AN  ORDINARY DAY DON'T KNOW IT'S  COMING. WHEN I READ THIS, I FEEL LIKE  I'M SOME SORT OF TIME-TRAVELING  ESPY WHO IS COMING IN SAMPLE OTHER PEOPLE'S SHOCK. I'M TASTING THEIR DISBELIEF AND  THE WAY... AND THE WAY IT'S  CHANGING THEM FOREVER. I AM TASTING IT WHILE I READ IT. AND IT FEELS EMPIRIC. ARE YOU GIVING US A FEAST OF  OTHER PEOPLE'S BLOOD?
THESE ARE THE TRAGEDIES THAT  MARK OUR LIVES.
Stephen: WHY NOT GO BACK  TO... (BOTH TALKING AT THE SAME  TIME).
Stephen: JUST FORGET THEY  HAPPENED.
THEY HAPPENED. Stephen: JUST FORGET THEY  HAPPENED SO WE CAN MOVE ON TO  HAPPY DAYS AGAIN.
THEN WE HAVE THINGS LIKE THE  BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING WHICH  COULD HAVE MADE AN 8th CHAP CHAPTER OF THIS BOOK.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE POINT TO  GOING BACK TO LOOKING AT THEM? THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ANOTHER  ONE.
WHY DON'T YOU WRITE THE NEXT  BOOK OF THE NEXT EIGHT OR NINE  OF THESE THAT HAPPENED. THIS BOOK CAN GO ON FOREVER. THAT REALLY IS...
Stephen: THAT'S SAD. MY DESIRE DOES NOT THINK ABOUT  BAD THINGS.
YOU MUST THINK ABOUT SAD  THINGS.
Stephen: WHY? BECAUSE SAD THINGS HAPPEN. Stephen: PUT ON A HAPPY FACE. SUSANNAH, OH, DON'T YOU CRY FOR  ME. THE BOOK IS SEVEN AMERICAN  DEATHS AND
