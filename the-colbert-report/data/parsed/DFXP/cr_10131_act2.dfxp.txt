WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT SPENT FOUR YEARS AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE MAKING HER THE  HIGHEST RANKING FEMALE POLITICIAN IN AMERICAN HISTORY, SORRY QUEEN LATIFAH, PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSWOMAN NANCY PELOSI! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THANKS FOR BEING BACK. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A FORMIDABLE ADVERSARY TO BE TALKING TO ACROSSED TABLE. ALL RIGHT? WE MEET AGAIN, MY OLD NEMESIS.
HELLO MY FRIEND.
Stephen: HELLO. WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT, YOU AND I. WE BOTH HAVE OUR AGENDAS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAST ONE YOU TRIED TO PUSH ON MY SHOW. THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE WE CAME TO A MEETING OF THE MINDS, YOU HAD SOMETHING CALLED THE DISCLOSE AGO WHERE YOU WOULD TRY TO GET POLITICIANS TO DISCLOSE ALL THE DONATIONS TO THEIR-- TO THEIR ASSOCIATIVE PACS OR 501 C 4s. IN RETURN I SAID I WOULD HELP YOU IF YOU WOULD GET MORE PEOPLE MORE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO BE PART OF MY BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT SERIES. I UPHELD MY END OF THE BARGAIN, YOU UPHELD YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN. WE PROVED PEOPLE COULD DO THINGS ACROSS THE AISLE.
THERE WE GO. ACROSS THE AISLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU PUSHING TONIGHT? WHAT NEFARIOUS--  (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO VALUE ARE YOU PUSHING? ON THE NATION TONIGHT?
TONIGHT I'M PUSHING OUR AGENDA OF THE MIDDLE CLASS JUMP START. THE  HEART OF IT IS WHEN WOMEN SUCCEED AMERICA SUCCEEDS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OK NO OFFENSE, MADAM, LISTEN, NO OFFENSE BUT THAT IS IMPLYING THAT WOMEN ARE THE MIDDLE CLASS. WHAT ABOUT THE MEN IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. HAVEN'T YOU JUST EMASCULATED THEM.
NO, WE'RE GETTING TO THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THE BEST THING WE CAN DO TO GROW OUR MIDDLE CLASS IS TO UNLEASH THE POWER OF WOMEN. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE. GOING ON, INVEST IN EDUCATION TO KEEP AMERICA NUMBER ONE, AND THIRD KEEP JOBS HERE IN THE U.S. WITH GOOD TAX POLICY INSTEAD OF SENDING THEM OVERSEAS AND BUILD ROADS, BRIDGES AND INFRASTRUCTURE BROADBAND IN OUR COUNTRY SO THAT ALL AMERICANS CAN PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROSPERITY AND IN AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THE PRIVILEGED FEW.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. (APPLAUSE) WE WILL GET TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ENGAGING IN CLASS WARFARE IN JUST A MOMENT, OKAY. YOU JUST DID IT, YOU JUST FIRED A SHOT ACROSS MY BOW BUT HOW  WILL YOU GET IT DONE THOUGH, BECAUSE NOTHING GETS DONE IN WASHINGTON.
THAT'S RIGHT.
NOTHING GETS DONE IN WASHINGTON. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY GET THIS DONE. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO USE. DO YOU HAVE NAKED PHOTOS OF JOHN BOEHNER DOING SOMETHING? HOW YOU COULD POSSIBLY GET-- BECAUSE REPUBLICANS-- YOU GOT THE MENTAL IMAGE.
NO, I --
AND IF YOU DO, IF YOU DO IS THE TAN UNIFORM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOPE, ALL RIGHT. HOW YOU COULD POSSIBLY GET IT DONE?
WIN THE ELECTION. ALL WE NEED IS 17 VOTES TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. OR-- .
Stephen: FOR THE DEMOCRATS.
THE DEMOCRATS.
Stephen: THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.
WELL, FOR THEM, FOR ISSUES THAT HELP THEM MEET THEIR NEEDS.
Stephen: BUT THAT WOULD MAKE YOU SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AGAIN, PROBABLY.
WELL, SOMEBODY, SOME DEMOCRAT.
Stephen: SOME, SOME DEMOCRAT WEARING A BLUE LINEN SUIT, WHO CARES WHO IT IS. WHY WOULD YOU EVER WANT THAT JOB AGAIN? JOHN BOEHNER IS ON THE EDGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO BURST INTO TEARS, ISN'T THAT A HARD JOB? THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY HARD JOB TO HOLD, ISN'T IT?
WELL, WHEN WE DID, WE WERE ABLE TO PASS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE WALL STREET REFORM. WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE MILLIONS OF ACRES OF GREEN ACRES IN AMERICA. GOOD THINGS ABOUT JOBS, ABOUT HEALTH CARE, ABOUT EDUCATION, ABOUT WORKING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I DIDN'T LOVE BEING SPEAKER, BUT I LIKED GETTING THE JOB DONE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A MOMENT MORE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO PARTICULAR A LITTLE BREAK BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH NANCY PELOSI. PLEASE STICK AROUND.
