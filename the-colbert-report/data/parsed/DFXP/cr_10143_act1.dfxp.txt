Stephen: HEY, JEFF. HI.
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE, MAN.
OH, MY PLEASURE. WHAT'S WRONG? (SIGHS)
Stephen: OH, NOTHING. YOU LOOK UPSET.
Stephen: IT'S JUST A MAJOR CRISIS.
YEAH? WELL, I'M AN ACTOR, YOU KNOW. LET ME ACT LIKE I'M HELPING.
Stephen: WOULD YOU? WELL, LAY IT ON ME, MAN.
Stephen: I'M IN A BIT OF A SHOW BUSINESS PICKLE. I'M NOT ACTUALLY HERE TONIGHT.
WHERE ARE YOU?
Stephen: I'M IN L.A. THE EMMYS WERE LAST NIGHT AND I WAS NOMINATED.
OH! WAS I NOMINATED?
Stephen: NO. (BLEEP).
WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?
Stephen: ME. YOU'RE NOT HERE?
Stephen: NO. AM I HERE?
Stephen: NO. THIS IS A PRE-TAPE. YOU'RE IN THE PAST.
WHEN IN THE PAST?
Stephen: TWO WEEKS AGO. OH.
Stephen: MY QUESTION IS, JEFF, SHOULD I COME BACK TO DO MY SHOW LIVE IN NEW YORK TONIGHT, WHICH INVOLVES ME TAKING THE RED EYE BACK FROM LOS ANGELES AFTER THE EMMYS, OR SHOULD I JUST PLAY A SHOW I RECORDED TWO WEEKS AGO?
WHO WAS THE GUEST?
Stephen: YOU ARE. OH! SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY COOL SHOW. WHY DON'T WE DO THE WHOLE PROS AND CONS THING WITH THIS DEAL.
Stephen: OKAY. WHAT ARE THE PROS OF YOU FLYING BACK AND DOING THE SHOW LIVE?
Stephen: WELL, THE MATERIAL WILL BE MORE TOPICAL, WHICH FULFILLS WHAT I BELIEVE IS A SACRED TRUST BETWEEN ME AND MY AUDIENCE.
AND THE CONS ARE...
Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO. THERE'S YOUR ANSWER, MAN, RIGHT THERE.
Stephen: (LAUGHTER) ONE OF THE THINGS IS I'M WORRIED MY AUDIENCE MIGHT MISS ME TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT I WON THE EMMY.
NO PROBLEMO. YOU JUST TAKE ONE OF THESE CAMERA PHONE THINGS WITH YOU.
Stephen: I'VE SEEN ONE OF THOSE.
AND THEN  YOU CAN EDIT IN AT THE EMMYS,  WHETHER YOU WIN OR NOT.
Stephen: ME TALKING THERE AND WE EDIT IT IN NOW, LIKE ON THIS PHONE?
SURE!
Stephen: HI! WE WON FOR SHOW AND WE WON FOR WRITING LAST WEEK AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO CELEBRATE IN THE OFFICIAL EMMY PARKING GARAGE, BECAUSE THAT'S GLAMOUR, THAT'S HOLLYWOOD. AND THANK YOU, NATION. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"!     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  Captioned by     Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org ♪♪ (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, NATION, HUGE SHOW TONIGHT! I AM EITHER VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE EMMYS OR WONDERING WHY I WENT. (LAUGHTER) EITHER WAY, I CANNOT WAIT TO FIND OUT HOW I AM SO HUNG OVER. OH, EXCUSE ME, HOLD ON A SECOND. MY STOUFFER FROZEN DINNER IS READY! AND, OH, KIDS! THERE'S NOTHING I ENJOY MORE THAN EATING A NICE, HOT STOUFFER'S FAMILY-SIZE LASAGNA. I MAY NOT BE A WHOLE FAMILY, BUT AFTER THIS, I WILL FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT A BABY IN ME! (LAUGHTER) AND THE REASON I'M STOUFFIN' MY FACE IS THIS COMPANY HAILS FROM THE 78th INSTALLMENT OF MY 434 PART SERIES, BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT. TONIGHT, OHIO'S 11TH,  THE FIGHTING 11TH! OHIO'S 11th, INCLUDES THE CITY OF CLEVELAND, FOUNDED BY GENERAL MOSES CLEVELAND IN 1796. AS OF 1800 THE CITY'S POPULATION CONSISTED OF ONLY THREE MEN -- A SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITION KNOWN TODAY AS NORTH DAKOTA. IN 1879, CLEVELAND BECAME THE WORLD'S FIRST CITY TO BE LIGHTED ELECTRICALLY. RESIDENTS WERE PROUD OF THE ACHIEVEMENT, THOUGH DISAPPOINTED TO SEE MORE OF CLEVELAND. (LAUGHTER) THE 11th IS HOME TO THE MIGHTY CUHAHOGA RIVER, ONCE SO POLLUTED, IT SPURRED THE   CREATION OF THE EPA AFTER CATCHING ON FIRE 13 TIMES. AFTER THE FIRST 12 FIRES THEY REALIZED THEY SHOULDN'T TRY TO PUT THEM OUT WITH RIVER WATER. IN 1935, THE DISTRICT WAS THE FIRST PLACE OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS FOUNDED BY BILL WILSON AND DR. BOB SMITH. OH, SHOOT! FOUNDED BY TWO GUYS. SORRY. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. OHIO'S 11th IS THE HOME OF THE CAVALIERS, THE BROWNS AND THE CLEVELAND INDIANS, A TEAM SO BAD THAT THEY ARE IN LAST PLACE AT OFFENDING NATIVE AMERICANS. (LAUGHTER) THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME IN CLEVELAND ATTRACTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS TO THE 11th EACH YEAR. THIS YEAR THE HALL INDUCTED '70s ROCK BAND KISS WHOSE FRONT MAN GENE SIMMONS IS THE ONLY THING MORE POLLUTED THAN THE CUYAHOGA RIVER. AND WHO HAS THE CLEVELAND ROCKS TO REPRESENT THE DISTRICT? IT'S NONE OTHER THAN CONGRESSWOMAN MARTHA FUDGE THE  HEAD OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS. I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE FUDGE IN HER WASHINGTON OFFICE. CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME.
MY PLEASURE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT THE FIGHTING 11th.
THE 11th, THOUGH MY OPINION IS PROBABLY BIASED, IS THE BEST IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE THE BEST ORCHESTRA, THE BEST HEALTHCARE WITH THE CLEVELAND CLINIC, UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS AND --
Stephen: LeBRON, AM I RIGHT? UP TOP?
LeBRON.
Stephen: UP TOP? YOU MUST BE EXCITED HE'S RETURNING TO CLEVELAND.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: YOU MUST BE PRETTY EXCITED WHEN ANYONE IS RETURNING TO CLEVELAND.
I AM EXCITED HE'S COMING BACK TO CLEVELAND, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: YOUR DISTRICT IS HOME TO MICELI DAIRY PRODUCTS AND YOU ALSO HOST AN ANNUAL LEMONADE STAND DAY AND YOU WERE BORN IN YOUR DISTRICT?
YES.
Stephen: IS IT ACCURATE TO SAY MILK, MILK, LEMONADE, AROUND THE CORNER FUDGE IS MADE? (LAUGHTER)
I GUESS, YES.
Stephen: OKAY, I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THAT PHRASE CAME FROM CLEVELAND IS KNOWN FOR ITS FANTASTIC HEALTHCARE.
CORRECT. THE CLEVELAND CLINIC IS THE SITE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST FACE TRANSPLANT.
YES.
Stephen: HOW DO I KNOW YOU ARE MARTHA FUDGE? PERHAPS SOMEONE STOLE YOUR FACE, PUT IT ON THEIR BODY  AND IS NOW HERE TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES AS MARTHA FUDGE THE CLEVELAND CLINIC HAS MADE THAT A REALITY
I'VE HAD THIS FACE A LONG TIME. A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW ME.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOUR OPINION.
OKAY.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK I SHOULD JUST GET A FRESHEN UP OR GET A WHOLE TEAR-DOWN AND HAVE A NEW ONE PUT ON.
I THINK YOU LOOK FINE.
Stephen: I'M THINKING JUST A LITTLE, LIKE THIS. JUST, HI! I'VE JUST BEEN SLEEPING A LOT. (LAUGHTER)
I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT.
Stephen: REALLY? YES.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S MOVE ON TO ANOTHER SUBJECT. WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT CHILDREN FROM EL SALVADOR AND GUATAMALA AND HONDURAS WHO ARE COMING TO OUR SOUTHERN BORDER IN DROVES?
I THINK WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE LAW AND THE LAW SAYS THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM A DUE PROCESS HEARING AND DETERMINE IF, IN FACT, THEY SHOULD BE SENT BACK OR IF THEY CAN STAY IN THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen: THE LAW ALSO SAYS TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS.
IT DOES AND WE DO.
Stephen: HOW SO? THEY'RE GETTING ACROSS, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE KIDS, IF THEY ARE KIDS. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY ARE CHILDREN. GUATEMALAIANS ARE VERY WONDERFUL BUT VERY SMALL PEOPLE (LAUGHTER) ANY ONE OF THEM COULD BE ADULTS WEARING A KID'S SUIT.
WE PUT LAWS IN PLACE FOR A REASON. THE 2008 LAW SIGNED BY PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH NEEDS TO BE ENFORCED.
Stephen: YOU FOUGHT FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM TO INCLUDE IMMIGRANTS FROM AFRICA. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT? WE TRIED THAT FOR 300 YEARS AND IT WAS TERRIBLE FOR BOTH SIDES TO BRING ALL THOSE IMMIGRANTS OVER HERE (LAUGHTER) LED TO A HUGE PROBLEM. LED TO A WAR.
IT WAS OVER SLAVERY.
Stephen: YOU'RE SAYING THE  WAR WASN'T OVER SLAVERY.
YES.
Stephen: IT WAS? BUT IT WASN'T NECESSARILY BECAUSE PEOPLE FROM AFRICA WERE TRYING TO COME ACROSS OUR BORDERS AS IMMIGRANTS. WE WERE BROUGHT HERE AGAINST OUR OWN WILL.
Stephen: WELL, HISTORY WILL BE THE JUDGE. (LAUGHTER) SPEAKING OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. JOHN BOEHNER. YOU HELD HANDS  WITH MITCH MCCONNELL AND JOHN BOEHNER  AND SANG WE SHALL OVERCOME RIGHT? TO COMMEMORATE THE  1964 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT
YES.
Stephen: RACISM IS OVER, RIGHT?
NO, IT IS NOT.
Stephen: HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THAT IF THERE WAS STILL RACISM?
IT SAYS WE SHALL, AT SOME POINT WE WILL.
Stephen: ♪♪ WE HAVE OVERCOME. ♪♪ JOIN ME. ♪ WE HAVE OVERCOME  ♪ WE HAVE OVERCOME ALBEIT RECENTLY ♪♪ THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER.
YES.
Stephen: WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT THE MOST EGREGIOUS PART OF RACISM, JIM CROW ERA, '50s, '60s, IS THERE ANY PART OF IT THAT YOU MISS?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OKAY. MAY I? THE DRINKING FOUNTAINS. DON'T GET ME WRONG, I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE WHITE OR BLACK DRINKING FOUNTAINS. ANYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRINK FROM ANY THEY WANT. BUT THERE WERE TWICE AS MANY DRINKING FOUNTAINS IT WAS JUST MORE CONVENIENT, YOU KNOW.
I DON'T THINK DRINKING FOUNTAINS ARE THE MOST SANITARY THING ANYWAY.
Stephen: SO YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THOSE  IS THAT THEY'RE UNSANITARY?
NO, MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT THERE WERE  WHITE FOUNTAINS AND BLACK FOUNTAINS.
Stephen: IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE EITHER ONE, WHY IS IT A PROBLEM?
IT RESTRICTED MOVEMENT IN OUR NATION.
Stephen: I AGREE. YOU AND I ARE SINGING THE SAME TUNE HERE, ALTHOUGH WITH DIFFERENT LYRICS. (LAUGHTER) CLEVELAND IS THE HOME TO THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME. CAN YOU GET ME IN?
YES.
Stephen: I HAVE TWO GRAMMIES. I HAD A BAND IN THE '80s CALLED STEPHEN AND THE COLBERTS. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE SONG "I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU NOW, CHARLENE"
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH, NO. ♪ EVERY TIME I SEE YOU, I THINK OF YOU ♪ ♪ EVERY TIME I'M NEAR YOU, I THINK OF YOU ♪ ♪ I THINK OF YOU WHEN I DREAM OF YOU ♪ ♪ AND I'M TAKING PICTURES OF YOU ♪ ♪ I THINK OF YOU WHEN I'M IN A BLIMP ♪ ♪ LOOK HING DOWN FROM UP ABOVE YOU ♪ ♪ YOU KNOW I'M MISSING YOU  ♪ MY MIND IS KISSING YOU  ♪ I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU NOW, CHARLENE ♪♪ (LAUGHTER)  ♪ ♪ I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU NOW, CHARLENE ♪♪ ♪♪ YOU'LL NEVER BE ALONE AGAIN, NO ♪♪ (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT DOESN'T RING A BELL AT ALL? IT DOESN'T --
ARE WE DONE? PLEASE.
Stephen: NO, WE'RE NOT DONE! STAY TUNED FOR THE EXCITING CONCLUSION OF THIS THING WE'RE NOT DONE WITH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ♪♪ (APPLAUSE)
