(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE SHOW,EVERYBOD GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! FOLKS, THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THANK YOU SO MUCH! FOLKS, FOLKS, AS YOU KNOW, YOU WATCH THE PROGRAM NIGHT TO NIGHT I PRIDE MYSELF ON MY DECISIVENESS. IF I EVER LOST MY ABILITY TO INSTANTLY KNOW MY NEXT COURSE OF ACTION, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO. (LAUGHTER) BUT EVEN I HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE MAP ON THIS SYRIA ISSUE. ON THE ONE HAND, HOLDING BASHAR AL-ASSAD RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR CRIMES AGAINST HIS OWN CITIZENS WAS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, "BEEN THERE; BOMBED THAT." (LAUGHTER) BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, NOT BOMBING DOES NOT INVOLVE BOMBING. (LAUGHTER) AND THE TRUTH IS, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT TO DO IN SYRIA. WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR ALLIES, WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR ENEMIES, WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR PUNDITS AND OUR POLITICIANS. BUT THERE'S ONE IMPORTANT VOICE THAT HAS REMAINED CONSPICUOUSLY SILENT: HALLUCINATING SHEEP HERDERS. UNTIL NOW, BECAUSE THE BIBLE HAS FINALLY WEIGHED IN. ACCORDING TO THE VANCOUVER "SUN BIBLICAL LITERALISTS SEE THE LOOMING DESTRUCTION OF DAMASCUS AS THE SIGN OF THE RETURN OF JESUS CHRIST TO EARTH AS PRECURSOR OF THE COSMIC APOCALYPSE. AND FOLKS -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BIG END OF THE WORLD FANS HERE TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER) AND THE SIGNS OF THE APOCALYPSE ARE EVERYWHERE. AFTER ALL: I JUST QUOTED FROM A CANADIAN NEWSPAPER! (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I AM NOT THE ONLY JOURNALIST REPORTING PROPHECY AS NEWS. SO IS FOX NEWS ANCHOR AND 11th PLAGUE NEIL CAVUTO.
BIBLICAL SCHOLARS SAY IT'S ALL THERE IN BLACK-AND-WHITE, LIKE THIS SPOOKY PASSAGE FROM ISAIAH 17 ABOUT SYRIA ITSELF. "BEHOLD, DAMASCUS IS ABOUT TO BE REMOVED FROM BEING A CITY AND WILL BECOME A FALLEN RUIN." ANOTHER PASSAGE WARNS OF GROWING UNREST IN EGYPT AND THE RISE OF A FIERCE KING.
Stephen: GOOD LORD! (LAUGHTER) EVERYTHING THE BIBLE SAYS IS COMING TO PASS! THANKFULLY, I ALREADY HAVE TWO OF EVERY ANIMAL IN MY MEAT ARK. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, NEIL CAVUTO WASN'T DONE THERE. AS A T.V. JOURNALIST, HIS JOB TO KEEP DIGGING UNTIL HE GETS TO THE NEXT COMMERCIAL. (LAUGHTER) SO HE BROUGHT ON ARMAGEDDON ENTHUSIAST JOEL ROSENBERG.
WE HAVE SEVEN MILLION SYRIANS ALREADY ON THE RUN, TWO MILLION HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY, FIVE MILLION ARE INTERNALLY DISPLACED THAT'S THE JEREMIAH 49 PROPHECY THAT SAYS PEOPLE WILL FLEE BUT THERE WILL STILL BE PEOPLE IN DAMASCUS WHEN THE PROPHECY HAPPENS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THESE TWO PROPHECIES-- ISAIAH 17 AND JEREMIAH 49 WILL HAPPEN IN OUR LIFETIME OR SOON BUT THEY COULD BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAPPENED YET.
Stephen: TRUE. (LAUGHTER) EVERYTHING THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET COULD HAPPEN! (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, THE SEAS TURNING RED WITH BLOOD. LIVES -- (APPLAUSE) LIONS LAYING DOWN WITH LAMBS. THE "FRIENDS" MOVIE. ALL POSSIBLE! (LAUGHTER) AND THE BIBLE ISN'T THE ONLY SOURCE THAT BACKS UP ROSENBERG'S LOGIC. IT IS CORROBORATED BY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BOOK "DAMASCUS COUNTDOWN" BY JOEL ROSENBERG. I MEAN, WHAT ARE THE ODDS? (LAUGHTER) AND HERE IS HIS PROOF THAT THE SYRIAN CONFLICT MAY BRING ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD.
IN THE NOVEL "DAMASCUS COUNTDOWN" IN WHICH I IMAGINE A SCENARIO THAT THOSE PROPHECIES COME TRUE IN OUR LIFETIME.
Stephen: YES, HE IMAGINES A SCENARIO. (LAUGHTER) WHICH QUALIFIES HIM TO BE INTERVIEWED BY AN IMAGINARY NEWSMAN. (LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I BELIEVE THIS MEANS THAT IF WE WANT TO SEE HOW THE WORLD ENDS ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FLIP TO THE END OF HIS BOOK. OKAY, HERE WE GO. "SHE WONDERED WHAT LIFE LAY BEFORE THEM, WHAT WOULD COME NEXT. BUT INSTEAD OF ASKING QUESTIONS, SHE SIMPLY LAID HER HEAD ON DAVID'S CHEST. SHE LOOKED AT THE ENGAGEMENT RING ON HER FINGER AND SAID RIGHT OUT LOUD "BLESS THE LORD OH MY SOUL." (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, IF I'M INTERPRETING THE BOOK OF ROSENBERG CORRECTLY -- (LAUGHTER) -- THE WORLD ENDS WITH A WEDDING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MAGICAL! FOLKS, DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THE GIFT RECEIPT BECAUSE CRATE & BARREL WILL NOT BE ACCEPTING RETURNS. (LAUGHTER) BUT, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M BEGINNING TO WORRY THAT THE APOCALYPSE MAY NOT START IN SYRIA AFTER ALL.
THE U.S. AND RUSSIA SAY THEY HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL AVERT AMERICAN AIR STRIKES BY REMOVING OR DESTROYING ALL CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA.
I SAY THIS PROVES OBAMA IS A SECRET MUSLIM. HE'S REFUSING TO BOMB SOMEONE JUST TO KEEP JESUS FROM COMING BACK! (LAUGHTER) THAT'S KIND OF PETTY. SO I AM PRAYING, PRAYING, THIS DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION FALLS THROUGH BECAUSE, FRANKLY, I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THE DAY OBAMA FINALLY EARNS THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE HE ALREADY WON. (LAUGHTER) BUT WITH THE DEFACE ALREADY HAMMERED OUT, HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY FALL THROUGH?
U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY SAID THEY WOULD SEEK A UNITED NATIONS RESOLUTION WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR SYRIA IF IT FAILS TO HAND OVER ITS CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
THE U.S. HAS SAID THE U.N. RESOLUTION DOESN'T HAVE TO THREATEN MILITARY ACTION.
Stephen: OH. THE U.N. IS HANDLING IT. (LAUGHTER) WELL, THAT MAKES IT RATHER U.N.-LIKELY TO SUCCEED. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, FOR PETE'S SAKE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOR PETE'S SAKE THESE PEOPLE STILL WEAR HEAD PHONES LIKE THIS. (LAUGHTER) GUYS, COME ON! IT'S 2013, GET SOME BEATS FOR GODS SAKES. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, THERE IS NO TWAY U.N. CAN RESOLVE THE CRISIS IN SYRIA! AND HERE TO TELL ME HOW THE U.N. CAN RESOLVE THE CRISIS IN SYRIA IS BLOGGER AND FOUNDER OF THE DISH MR. ANDREW SULLIVAN. ANDREW, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ANDREW, DO YOU BELIEVE WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING MILITARY ACTION AGAINST BASHAR AL-ASSAD USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF DOING SOMETHING OR DOING NOTHING?
DOING SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE GET INVOLVED IN SOMEONE ELSE'S CIVIL WAR. THAT'S WHAT I'M IN FAVOR OF AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT.
Stephen: SO DOING SOMETHING THAT IS NOTHING?
NO.
Stephen: LIKE? YOU WANT TO GET THE U.N. INVOLVED?
NO, I WANT RUSSIA WHICH IS THE CRITICAL MEMBER OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL INVOLVED HERE AND CHINA ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL WHO HAVE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY SAYING WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE ASSAD CONTROLS AND EVENTUALLY DESTROYS HIS CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
Stephen: YOU TRUST RUSSIA AND CHINA MORE THAN YOU TRUST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! YOUR WORD! THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST SAID! (LAUGHTER)
LET ME TELL YOU --.
Stephen: ANSWER THE QUESTION. DO YOU TRUST PUTIN AND WHOEVER CHINA PUTIN IS -- (LAUGHTER) -- DO YOU TRUST THOSE GUYS MORE THAN BARACK OBAMA? OUR COMMANDER? CHIEF?
YES, BECAUSE THE WORLD HAS SEEN AMERICA GO INTO THESE PLACES ALONE.
Stephen: AND KICK ASS AND TAKE NAMES.
AND MAKE AN ALL MIGHTY MESS IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DIE, WE LOST TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GET IT DONE AND NOT PROVOKE OUTCRY AND ACTUALLY GET ASSAD'S COOPERATION THEN GETTING RUSSIA AND CHINA TO DO OUR DIRTY WORK FOR US IS A GREAT THING. OUR GOAL IS NOT TO HAVE THE BIGGEST EGO IN THE WORLD --.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE STICK?
THE STICK IS THAT WE THREATEN MILITARY STRIKES AGAINST THEM.
Stephen: RIGHT! AND YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO GO THROUGH WITH THAT! AND IF THEY DON'T COMPLY AND IF ASSAD DOES USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAIN OBAMA HAS A MUCH STRONGER CASE TO MAKE "LOOK, WE TRIED PEACE, WE TRIED THIS PROCESS, NOW IT DOESN'T WORK, WE HAVE A RIGHT TO STOP THESE WEAPONS."
Stephen: SO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF THE DEAL DOESN'T GO THROUGH, IF IT FALLS APART IT'S TIME TO TURN DAMASCUS INTO THE BOOM-BOOM? (LAUGHTER)
NO, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BLOW UP CHEMICAL WEAPONS SITES WITHOUT CREATING A NIGHTMARE, WITHOUT CREATING THE VERY THING YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID.
Stephen: BUT IT'S SENDING A MESSAGE.
YOU CAN'T SEND A MISSILE TO BLOW SARIN GAS HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU HAVE TO SECURE THEM.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO SEND A MESSAGE.
WE SENT IT T MESSAGE, IT WAS RECEIVED IN DAMASCUS, THEY GAVE UP. I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE THAT! ASSAD SURRENDERED.
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE TRYING -- HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET. YOU WANT TO BE A UNITED STATES CITIZEN, TRUE?
YES, PLEASE.
Stephen: YOU WANT TO BE A UNITED STATES CITIZEN. OKAY, ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S SUCH A THING AS AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, ALL RIGHT? THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO US.
(LAUGHS)
Stephen: WE GET TO DO WHAT WE WANT. EVERYBODY SHOULD SAY "HEY, THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE AMERICA DID IT." (LAUGHTER)
WHY NOT USE THE RULES TO GET WHAT WE WANT DONE WITHOUT HAVING TO OURSELVES ACTUALLY HAVING TO DO IT?
Stephen: AND USE THE U.N. RESOLUTION?
THE U.N. IS A USEFUL INSTITUTION TO COVER AND TO EXECUTE GREAT POWER DESIGNS.
Stephen: WHAT GREAT POWER? WHAT WAR HAVE THEY EVER PREVENTD?
WELL, WE MAY HAVE JUST PREVENTED THIS ONE AND I ALE TELL YOU WHY.
Stephen: BUT WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN!
WE DON'T KNOW YET.
Stephen: YOU CAN'T PROVE A NEGATIVE.
WHAT WE HAVE PREVENTD IS ANY MAJOR WAR BETWEEN GREAT POWERS.
Stephen: BECAUSE IF WE WANTED TO GO TO WAR WITH RUSSIA OR CHINA THEY WOULD VETO IT AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO STOP. (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE NOT WRONG. THAT'S WHY WE -- WE TRY -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HOW DO YOU BECOME A SUPERPOWER IF IT DOESN'T EXERCISE SUPERPOWERS? THAT'S LIKE SAYING "I'M FANTASTIC DANCER I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET UP RIGHT NOW." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL JUST CUT IT OUT. GO AHEAD. (LAUGHTER) ANDREW SULLIVAN, THE DISH
