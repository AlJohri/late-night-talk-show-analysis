Stephen: TONIGHT, WHAT IS  ART, A THREE LETTER WORD FOR  DISAPPOINTING YOUR PARENTS. THEN SCIENTISTS RELEASED A  STUDY ON FRIENDSHIP. AND SQUIRT SHAMPOO IN  ARABITY'S EYE, IT IS WHAT  THEY DO. AND MY GUEST IS MSNBC HOST  RACHEL MADDOUT. IF SHE'S HERE THEN WHO IS  GETTING RATINGS ON MSNBC. A NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY SPENT  HIS PARENT'S LIFE SAVINGS ON  CANDY. HE SHOULDN'T HAVE PAID FULL  PRICE FOR THAT $100,000 BAR. THIS IS "THE COLBERT  REPORT."    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. NATION, YOU KNOW, HERE IN  THE TRISTATE AREA WE ARE  STILL DEALING WITH THE  AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE SANDY. THINGS GOT SO BAD THAT  PEOPLE IF BROOKLYN WERE  FORCED TO LIVE LIKE THEY  WERE IN THE 19th CENTURY INSTEAD OF JUST DRESSING  LIKE IT. BUT JUST, JUST WHEN WE  THOUGHT THAT THE WORSE WAS  OVER WE GOT HIT AGAIN.
A NEW NOR'EASTER IS  SLAMMING NEW YORK AND NEW  JERSEY. A BRUTAL NOR'EASTER.
NOR'EASTER.
NOR'EASTER.
YES, A NOR'EASTER. (LAUGHTER)  A STOORM SO POWERFUL IT CAN  WIPE OUT A REGION'S SUPPLY  OF Ts AND Hs. (LAUGHTER)  AND FOLKS, I'M AFRAID THAT  THIS NEW STORM COULD HURT  ROMNEY'S MOMENTUM. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN-- WHEERS PLAUS IT  COULD SLOW HIM DOWN. I MEAN HE ALREADY LOST THE  ELECTION THAT CAN'T HELP. BUT OF COURSE FLORIDA IS  STILL BEING COUNTED. SO FOLKS I GOT TO TILL, I AM  STILL HANGING IN THERE AND  I'M CHECKING FOR UPDATES ON THE CAMPAIGN'S I'M WITH MITT  APP. OKAY. IT STILL WORKS. AND IT LETS YOU TAKE PHOTOS  WITH LITTLE MESSAGES THAT  SHOW YOUR SUPPORT FOR MITT  ROMNEY. I TWEETED THIS ONE TODAY. (LAUGHTER)  I'M WITH MITT. THEN LATER I TWEETED I'M  STAND BEING MITT. AND EVENTUALLY I'M IN THE  FETAL POSITION WITH MITT. BUT ULTIMATELY, FOLKS THIS  ELECTION ONLY MATTERS SO  MUCH. REAL CHANGE COMES FROM  PRIVATE CITIZENS MAKING A  DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LOCAL  COMMUNITIES. THE WOMAN WHO RUNS THE SOUP  KITCHEN. TEENS WHO CLEAN UP A VACANT  LOT. THE GUY WHO FISHES GOLF  BALLS OUT OF THE POND AND  SELLS THEM BACK TO YOU AT  HALF PRICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AND EVERY SO OFTEN WE  CELEBRATE THOSE HEROES ON MY  SHOW. AND IN A SEGMENT WE CALL  DIFFERENCE MAKERS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND TONIGHT FOLKS, WE'RE  DOING IT AGAIN. IN OUR WAENINGED ECONOMY THE  NATIONS ART FUNDING IS AT AN  ALL-TIME LOW. LEAVING MANY AMERICANS TO  ASK WHO CARES. BUT HERE IN NEW YORK'S  CAPITAL OF ARTS AND CULTURE.
AN AMAZING DISCOVERY.
THERE IS CONCERN BECAUSE  AN ALBANY ARTS INSTITUTION  IS UNDER ATTACK AND ONLY ONE MAN CAN SAVE IT.
I FEEL THAT ALL ART NEEDS  TO BE PROTECTED. THIS IS ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I BELIEVE IN THE  CONSTITUTION. I BELIEVE IN OUR COUNTRY AND  WHAT OUR FOREFATHERS SET  FORTH FOR US.
WHICH IS LIFE, LIBERTY  AND THE PURSUIT OF  HAPPINESS. IN OTHER WORDS,.
FULLY NUDE, EXOTIC  ENTERTAINMENT.
HE IS A PATRON OF THE ART  OF EXOTIC DANCE.
I'M THE OWNER OF NIGHT  MOVES.
AND YOU, STEVEN DICK, JR.,  WAIT, CERTIFICATE QUUSSLY,  STEP ENDICK IS YOUR NAME.
MY REAL NAME.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT THEN,  YOU, STEVEN DICK IS ARE A  DIFFERENCE MAKER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOR YEARS THIS DICK HAS BEEN  PROVIDING ALBANY CULTURAL  ENRICHMENT THROUGH HIS DANCE THEATRE NIGHT MOVES.
I AM THE LAST REMAINING  ALL NUDE CLUB IN ALBANY.
Stephen: BUT NOW THE  COMMUNITY MAY LOSE THIS  TREASURED INSTITUTION. BECAUSE NEW YORK STATE HIT  NIGHT MOVES WITH A BILL FOR  ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS IN BACK TAXES. SO STEVEN DICK DID WHAT ANY  PATRIOT WOULD DO.
WE DIDN'T PAY THEM.
AND WHY WOULD HE? BECAUSE STATE LAW HAS AN  EXEMPTION FOR MUSICAL AND  DRAMATIC PERFORMANCES. THIS IS ART ROSEN, FORMER  DEPUTY COUNCIL OF THE NEW  YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF  TAXATION AND FINANCE. HE SAYS IT ALL COMES DOWN TO  ONE QUESTION.
IS EXOTIC DANCING ART. SURE, BUT HOW WOULD STEVEN  DICK PROVE IT IN A COURT OF  LAW.
WE HAD AN EXPERT WITNESS,  DR. JUDITH HANNA.
DR. JUDITH HANNA IS A  SENIOR RESEARCH SCHOLAR AT  THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND. AND THE AUTHOR OF EIGHT  BOOKS ON DANCE AND SOCIETY.
SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY IF  IT'S NOT WITHIN THEIR OWN  GENRE OR FORM OF DANCE THAT IT'S NOT ART. BUT I USE THE DICTIONARY  DEFINITION AND HAVE  DISTILLED FROM THE  LITERATURE ON WHAT IS ART TO COME UP WITH THE DEFINITION  THAT IT IS A LEARNED SKILL,  THAT IT IS CREATIVE,  IMAGINATIVE AND THAT IT  COMMUNICATES.
OKAY, I DID NOT CATCH ALL  OF THAT. BUT WOULD DR. HANNA'S  TESTIMONY STAND UP TO THE  HIGH COURT'S DEFINITION OF  ART?
ONE OF THE JUDGES IN OUR  MOST RECENT CASE HIS QUOTE  WAS --
CAN WE GET PAST THE IDEA  THAT HOW THIS WAS THE --
THEY HAVE BEEN COMPARING  TO US BALANCER INAS SO MUCH  AND THAT PEOPLE PAY SOME OF MONEY TO GO TO A BALLET AND  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS  SO MUCH DIFFERENT FOR US HERE JUST BECAUSE WE TAKE  OUR CLOTHES OFF.
I THINK IT'S CLEAR IN  EVERYBODY'S EYES THAT A BALL  ERINA IS PERFORMING  CHOREOGRAPHY. AND THE QUESTION HERE ARE  THE MOVES THAT ARE DONE BY A  STRIPPER ALSO CHOREOGRAPHY.
DR. HANNA?
JUST LIKE YOU HAVE TERMS  IN BALLET FOR PLIE, THERE  ARE TERMS FOR A MOVE, SPREAD SHOW, GO PINK, SPREAD EAGLE,  THE BIG BIRD, PINK BUY CASE,  THE BUTTERFLY IS A MOVE WHERE THE DANCER PUTS HER  KNEES TOGETHER AND APART.
SHE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE  ART BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS THE  LADIES LOVE STRIPPERS. TO WIN THIS CASE DICK NEEDS  A MAN'S OBJECTIVE OPINION. STEVE BARNES OF THE ALBANY  TIMES UNION IS THE AREA'S  MOST ESTEEMED ART CRITIC. WE ASKED MR. MR. BARNES FOR  HIS PROFESSIONAL REVIEW OF  THE SHOW.
IS EXOTIC DANCE, ACT ONE  IS THE DANCER COMING OUT,  PERFORMING ON STAGE.
DURING THE COURSE AT  WHICH SHE TAKES OFF HER  ALREADY SKIMPY ATTIRE TO  NOTHING AT ALL AND SWIRLS AROUND THE POLE.
THE PERFORMERS HAVE SOME  SKILL, THEY HAVE SOME  CREATIVITY.
IT'S ALMOST A SIMULATE  RODMAN PARTICULAR  EXPERIENCE.
WIN DESK ON THE POLE, UP  AND DOWN THE POLE IN A  SUGGESTED MANNER.
SHE MIGHT INTERACT WITH  THE PATRONS WHO COME UP TO  TIP HER.
PUT IN IN HER CHIEFAGE,  SOME HAVE A G STRING, THEY  ARE PULL IT OUT AND OTHERS JUST STAND THERE WITH THEIR  HAND OUT.
AND ACT TWO WOULD BE THE  PRIVATE DANCE.
THERE IS MORE THEATRE  INVOLVED IN THE LAP DANCE  THAN THE STAGE.
THE GIRL CAME UP AND CLAM  PERED ON TOP OF ME AS IF I  WERE A JUNGLE GYM.
SHE'S CONVEYING A MESSAGE  TO THE PATRON.
SHE PUSHED PIE LEG AS  PART AND SAID RELAX, GET ME  GET DOWN IN THERE.
SHE MIGHT TOUCH THE  PATRON'S SHOULDERS.
SMASHED MY FACE INTO HER  CHEST, MY GLASSES FROM A  COUP.
THEY MIGHT TALK.
BREAST SWEAT ON MY  GLASSESES, FIRST TIME ON THE  JOB. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND THE REVIEW  IS IN.
I WAS ENTERTAINED BY IT. BECAUSE I'M GAY I GET  ABSOLUTELY NO-- .
Stephen: YOU'RE GAY?
YES, OH, WELL, ANYWAY,  ANSWER THE QUESTION. IS EXOTIC DANCING ART?
IT'S SOMETHING CREATED  WITH AN AESTHETIC INTENT. WHEN YOU-- THE AUDIENCE  COMPONENT, THAT'S IT, IT'S  ART.
Stephen: SEE EVEN THE GAY  GUY SAYS IT'S ART.
IT'S LOUSY ART, THOUGH.
Stephen: HOW WOULD YOU  KNOW, YOU'RE GAY. THE POINT IS IT'S ART AND  STEVEN DICK IS FIGHTING FOR  IT.
I REFUSE TO BACK DOWN TO  THE STATE WHEN EVERYONE TOLD  ME I COULDN'T WIN.
Stephen: WELL, GUESS WHAT,  EVERYONE, YOU WERE RIGHT.
LAP DANCE IS APPARENTLY  AREN'T HIGHBROW ENOUGH TO  GET A TAX BREAK CORDING TO NEW YORK'S HIGHEST COURT.
Stephen: BUT THIS  DIFFERENCE MAKER WON'T QUIT. HE IS TAKING HIS BATTLE ALL  THE WAY TO THE SUPREME  COURT.
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE  TO BE REMEMBERED FOR. IS SOMEONE THAT FOUGHT FOR  PEOPLE'S RIGHTS.
Stephen: MAKING HIM THE  MARTIN LUTHER KING OF EXOTIC  DANCE.
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD  SAY HE IS THE MARTIN LUTHER  KING OF EXOTIC DANCERS BUT HE'S DEFINITELY MAKING A  DIFFERENCE.
I THINK STEVE DICK IS  MAKING A DIFFERENCE.
I THINK HE'S PROBABLY  JUST TRYING TO SAVE HIMSELF  A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY.
Stephen: MAYBE SO. BUT ANY MONEY HE GETS IN A  SETTLEMENT WILL GO STRAIGHT  TO THE DANCERS.
THE DANCERS WILL NOT BE  RECEIVING ANY OF THE  SETTLEMENT.
Stephen: NOW THAT'S A  REAL DICK MOVE. AND YOU, SIR ARE A  DIFFERENCE MAKER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  S.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK.
