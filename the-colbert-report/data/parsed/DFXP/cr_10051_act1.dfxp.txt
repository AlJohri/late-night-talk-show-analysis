Stephen: TONIGHT, CAN WE TRUST THE PEOPLE WITH THEIR FINGER ON THE BUTTON? I DON'T KNOW, WHERE'S THEIR OTHER FINGER. (LAUGHTER) THEN, A NEW WAY TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST-- CONTINUE SITTING ON THE COUCH TO FIND OUT. AND MY GUEST, JOURNALIST CHARLES DUHIGG SAYS WE MAKE MANY OF OUR DECISIONS OUT OF PURE HABIT. NOT TRUE. I MOSTLY MAKE MY DECISIONS OUT OF PURE SPITE. THE RECENT BLIZZARD CRACKED A GIANT GLASS PANEL AT NEW YORK'S APPLE STORE. THEY CAN GET IT FIXED FOR FREE-- IF THEY DON'T TELL APPLE IT GOT WET. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."      Captioning sponsored by      COMEDY CENTRAL      Captioning sponsored by      COMEDY CENTRAL      Captioning sponsored by      COMEDY CENTRAL (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") WHY NOT? LET'S DO THIS. I'M UP FOR IT, ARE YOU UP FOR IT? I'LL DO IT! I MIGHT AS WELL DO THE SHOW. YOU READY TO DO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALRIGHT, THAT'S GOOD. I LIKE IT.  YES. NATION, NATION, HERE IN NEW YORK CITY WE ARE JUST DIGGING OUT FROM THE MASSIVE POLAR NOR'SNOWSTER OF THE LAST 24 HOURS. WE GOT 11 INCHES OF SNOW AND THAT'S IN FREEZING COLD WEATHER BECAUSE, NORMALLY, IT'S LIKE 15 INCHES. (LAUGHTER) BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHO I AM MOST WORRIED ABOUT WITH THIS STORM-- SPACE. (LAUGHTER) IT PROBABLY GOT HIT EXTRA HARD SINCE IT'S CLOSER TO THE SKY. (LAUGHTER) BUT THIS STORM IS NOT THE BIGGEST NEWS IN SPACE TODAY. JIM, YOU ARE GO FOR FOOTAGE!
NASA OFFICIALS SAY SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS HAS HAPPENED ON MARS. LIKE NOTHING THEY HAVE EVER BEFORE SEEN. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. NOTICE -- NOTICE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THESE TWO PICTURES. THIS IS TWO DIFFERENT PICTURES TAKEN OF THE SAME AREA. YOU CAN SEE THE MARKINGS ON THE MARTIAN SURFACE THERE. THEN THERE'S THIS THING. A ROCK HAS APPEARED. NASA SCIENTISTS SAY IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A JELLY DOUGHNUT AND LOOKS LIKE A JELLY DOUGHNUT AS WELL.
Stephen: MARS HAS DOUGHNUTS. (LAUGHTER) FINALLY, WE'VE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS. WE HAVE FINALLY FOUND A HABITABLE PLANET. CALL OFF THE SEARCH FOR WATER AND START LOOKING FOR A LAKE OF COOLATTA. (LAUGHTER) NATION, THIS IS THE GREATEST SPACE DISCOVERY SINCE GALILEO FOUND THE MILKY WAY. (LAUGHTER) ACCORDING TO NASA, THIS OBJECT IS VERY HIGH IN SULFUR AND MAGNESIUM-- SO IT'S JUST AS NUTRITIOUS AS DUNKIN'. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS SPACE PASTRY OR SPACETRY, IS GREAT NEWS FOR NASA BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO FIND PEOPLE WILLING TO SIT IN A TIN CAN FOR SIX MONTHS TO GET TO MARS BUT WE KNOW PEOPLE WILL WAIT ANY AMOUNT OF TIME FOR A CRONUT! (LAUGHTER) NOW, OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE OUT THERE -- (APPLAUSE). PEOPLE LOVE SCIENCE. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE CAN ACCEPT THE AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT MARS IS COVERED IN DOUGHNUTS. THE MARS ROVER'S LEAD SCIENTIST IS BAFFLED SAYING "IT'S LIKE NOTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF THIS MEANS. WE'RE COMPLETELY CONFUSED." (LAUGHTER) I DON'T SEE WHY. I MEAN, CLEARLY WE FOUND LIFE ON MARS AND THE ALIENS ARE DOUGHNUTS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY AFTER YOU HAVE A STOMACH FULL OF THEM YOU FEEL LIKE THIS.
KILL ME! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND THE MARTIANS MUST BE UPSET ABOUT HOW MANY OF THEM WE'VE EATEN. SO BEFORE THEY STRIKE BACK, I THINK SOMEONE NEEDS TO BROKER A PEACE BETWEEN THESE TWO PLANETS SO I HAVE VOLUNTEERED. ON MY WAY TO WORK THIS MORNING I PICKED UP A MARTIAN. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GREETINGS! (LAUGHTER) I AM AN EARTHLING. WE MEAN YOU NO HARM. HOLD ON, I'VE GOT SOME ALIEN SPORE ON MY FINGERS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL, THAT DID NOT GO AS WELL AS I HAD HOPED. (LAUGHTER) I HOPE THAT ALIEN DOESN'T UPSET MY GLUTEN ALLERGY. (LAUGHTER) NATION, THERE'S AN OLD SAYING: OPINIONS ARE LIKE DEMO TAPES, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOURS. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, I KNOW IT'S 2014 BUT I STILL WORRY ABOUT NUCLEAR WAR. I'M BEGINNING TO BE AFRAID THAT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE ONE. (LAUGHTER) I'VE BEEN DRINKING MY OWN URINE FOR NOTHING. (LAUGHTER) I'LL TELL YOU WHO'S NOT BOLSTERING MY CONFIDENCE THAT ARMAGEDDON IS COMING-- THE CLOWNS WHO RUN OUR NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
34 OFFICERS IN CHARGE OF OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL SAID TO BE INVOLVED IN A SCHEME TO CHEAT ON A PROFICIENCY EXAM. THEY'VE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR COMMAND AND IT'S RAISING NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PEOPLE WITH THEIR FINGERS ON THE BUTTON.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU CHEAT AT NUCLEAR WEAPONS? DO YOU WRITE "PUSH RED BUTTON" ON THE BACK OF YOUR HAND? FOLKS, I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TO THE AIR FORCE FOR REMOVING THESE OFFICERS FROM DUTY. HERE ME OUT. SURE, OUR NUKE OPERATORS WERE SENDING EACH OTHER TEXT MESSAGES TO CHEAT ON ROUTINE PROFICIENCY TESTS. BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? IT'S NOT LIKE THEY CAN COPY OFF THE CHINESE KID! HE'S THE ONE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE NUKING! (LAUGHTER) BESIDES, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, CHEATING IS SUCH A MINOR OFFENSE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THEY WERE ACTUALLY BEING INVESTIGATED FOR DRUG ABUSE.
IT STARTED WITH A PROBE INTO ILLEGAL DRUG POSSESSION.
AT LEAST TEN OFFICERS AT SIX DIFFERENT BASES IN THE U.S. AND BRITAIN ARE SUSPECTED OF POSSESSION OF SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA AND ECSTASY.
Stephen: FOLKS, IT'S OBVIOUS THAT OUR NUCLEAR LAUNCH CREWS ARE BORED. (LAUGHTER) THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON HIGH ALERT AT ALL TIMES FOR SOMETHING THEY KNOW WILL NEVER HAPPEN! THEY'RE LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL FRENCH HORN PLAYER WITH A CONDOM IN HIS POCKET. (LAUGHTER) GIVE IT UP, TEDDY! GIVE IT UP. (APPLAUSE) ONLY THING YOU'RE GOING TO BE FONDLING IS YOUR SPIT VALVE. FOLKS, OUR NUKE CREWS CLEARLY NEED A SENSE OF PURPOSE. CAN'T WE JUST LET THEM LAUNCH ONE? I SAY WE PICK A COUNTRY AT RANDOM AND LET HER RIP. DO WE REALLY NEED MADAGASCAR AT THIS POINT? I MEAN, WE'VE GOT THE MOVIES! (LAUGHTER) NEXT UP, NATION, WE'RE ALL SHOCKED BY THE TRAGIC SHOOTING AT A TAMPA MOVIE THEATER WHERE A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER SHOT A MAN WHO WAS TEXTING ON A PHONE. IT'S A SENSELESS TRAGEDY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY? THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT SENSELESS IS WITH SENSELESS. LUCKILY, FOX NEWS DR. KEITH ABLOW'S MIDDLE NAME IS "SENSELESS."
WE MAY HAVE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING I'LL CALL "DATA RAGE." JUST LIKE ROAD RAGE. WE KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE INTERACT WITH MACHINES THAT SOMETIMES THEY FEEL EMBOLDENED TO DO THINGS THAT THEY NEVER WOULD. THEY MAY BE IMPULSIVE TO BEGIN WITH OR EXPLOSIVE. ADD IN TECHNOLOGY OR A MACHINE AND THINGS CAN GO OVER THE TOP AND BECOME VERY VIOLENT.
Stephen: EXACTLY. THIS TAMPA MOVIE THEATER TRAGEDY WAS A TEXTBOOK CASE OF THE THING KEITH ABLOW JUST YANKED OUT OF HIS ASS. (LAUGHTER) DATA RAGE. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A NORMAL ARGUMENT BUT THERE WAS A DISASTROUS AND DANGEROUS MACHINE INVOLVED. NO, JIMMY, I SAID A DANGEROUS MACHINE. THANK YOU. (LAUGHTER) OKAY, SO I AM GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO DR. KEITH ABLOW FOR POINTING OUT THAT TECHNOLOGY LEADS TO VIOLENCE. I KNOW EVERY TIME I SEE HIM ON A TELEVISION I WANT TO KILL SOMEONE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) FINALLY, IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR THE ANNUAL WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW. I'M SO EXCITED I HAD TO CHANGE THE CARPET SEVERAL TIMES. (LAUGHTER) UNFORTUNATELY, THE DOG SHOW HAS BEEN A VERY BAD BOY.
A NEW BREED OF DOGS IS TAKING OVER WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW-- MUTTS. THE PREMIER U.S. CANINE EVENT IS ALLOWING MIXED BREED COMPETITORS. THEY'LL BE INCLUDED IN ITS NEW AGILITY TRIAL. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME DOGS OF MIXED BREED HAVE BEEN AT WESTMINSTER IN ITS 138-YEAR HISTORY.
Stephen: MUTTS INVADING WESTMINSTER? FOLKS, THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE! TODAY IT'S MUTTS, TOMORROW IT'S A FINISH SPITZ WHOSE COAT GOES BEYOND DEEP AUBURN TO BROWN! NEXT THING YOU KNOW, A GUY CAN MARRY A BOX TURTLE. (LAUGHTER) OH, IT'S COMING! (APPLAUSE) FOR INSTANCE, SHELLEY HERE. (APPLAUSE) FOR INSTANCE, SHELLEY HERE. (LAUGHTER) SO -- (APPLAUSE). A WAG OF THE FINGER, WESTMINSTER! I AM JUST GRATEFUL THAT SHASTA, MY CHILDHOOD WELSH SPRINGER SPANIEL, ISN'T AROUND TO SEE THIS. HIS GREAT GRANDPARENTS DIDN'T SIT IN A CRATE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN SO THEIR DESCENDANTS WOULD HAVE TO SHARE A GREEN FELT WALKING COURSE WITH SOME PORTUGUESE CHORKIE. YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET A CHORKIE, RIGHT? YOU CROSS A YORKIE WITH A CHIMP. (AUDIENCE REACTS) I ONLY PRAY THAT WORD OF THIS DOES NOT REACH SHASTA AT THAT FARM UPSTATE MY PARENTS SENT HIM TO. (LAUGHTER) HE'S HAD 25 GREAT YEARS UP THERE. I'M GOING TO VISIT YOU SOON, BUDDY. (AUDIENCE REACTS) NOW, THIS YEAR'S AGILITY COMPETITION WILL BE FULL OF STREET TRAMPS LIKE ALFIE, AN ATHLETIC CHARMING SEVEN-YEAR-OLD POODLE TERRIER WHO WAS BOUGHT FOR $99 AT A PET STORE. NO SURPRISE. I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY THIS BUT THE MUTTS ARE VERY ATHLETIC. (AUDIENCE REACTS) YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY? YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY? PURE BREDS CAN'T JUMP. BUT THAT HAS NOT CHANGED THE FACT THAT THE LHASANESE WEIMER DOODLES OF THE WORLD ARE GENETICALLY INFERIOR. AND THAT'S NOT MY OPINION, THAT'S SCIENCE. I'M A TRAINED VETERINARY PHRENOLOGIST. JUST LOOK AT THIS MISCREANT. (AUDIENCE REACTS) RIGHT HERE. YOU CAN FEEL RIGHT THERE, YOU CAN FEEL RIGHT THERE ON THE SKULL THERE'S SOME NODULES. HIS OVERSIZED ACQUISITIVENESS RIDGE IS CLEARLY EVIDENCE OF A CRIMINAL MIND. WHO'S AN INFERIOR CANINE? YOU ARE! YOU ARE! (AUDIENCE REACTS) YOU WANT A LITTLE MARTIAN? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO, FOLKS, ENJOY THIS YEAR'S WESTMINSTER FARCE WHICH, IF YOU ASK ME, BECAME INEVITABLE ONCE THEY STARTED ACCEPTING BREEDS LESS PURE THAN WOLF. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
