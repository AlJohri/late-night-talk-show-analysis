Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A U.C.L.A. PROFESSOR WIDELY REGARDED AS THE WORLD'S GREATEST LIVING MATHEMATICIAN. I'LL ASK HIM WHAT NUMBER I'M THINKING OF. PLEASE WELCOME TERENCE TAO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MR. TAO, PROFESSOR TAO, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING ON. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
IT'S A PLEASURE.
Stephen: NOW, YOU ARE A PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AT U.C.L.A. YOU HAVE WON A FIELDS MEDAL, WHICH IS REGARDED AS THE NOBEL PRIZE OF MATHEMATICS.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Stephen: IT'S BEEN CALLED THAT. YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE THEM MacARTHUR GENIUS FELLOWSHIPS AND YOU WON THE 2015 BREAKTHROUGH PRIZE IN MATHEMATICS, THOUGH IT'S ONLY 2014. DID I JUST CHECK YOUR MATH?
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FUTURE.
Stephen: IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FUTURE OKAY. YOU'RE KNOWN BY SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES AS THE MOZART OF MATH. HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU GOT INTO MATH?
SO MY PARENTS TOLD ME WHEN I WAS TWO THEY FOUND ME  TEACHING SOME OLDER KIDS HOW TO COUNT USING NUMBER BLOCKS
Stephen: REALLY. SO YOU'RE BOSSY, TOO?
I GUESS SO. I DON'T REMEMBER IT MYSELF. APPARENTLY I TAUGHT MYSELF TO COUNT FROM "SESAME STREET."
Stephen: WAS THE COUNT VON COUNT THE ONE WHO TAUGHT YOU?
I GUESS IT MUST HAVE BEEN. GOOD GUY.
Stephen: HE SHOULD GET SOME OF THAT FIELDS MEDAL MONEY, I THINK. YOU HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC SPECIALTY WHICH IS PRIME NUMBERS. I REMEMBER, OBVIOUSLY, I REMEMBER MATH CLASS THERE'S THE NUMBER LINE AND ALL THAT. POSITIVE IS THAT WAY, NEGATIVE IS THAT WAY. TALK TO ME ABOUT PRIMES. WHY DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PRIMES?
PRIME NUMBERS ARE WHOLE NUMBERS BIGGER THAN 1 BUT THEY CAN'T BE FACTORED INTO SMALLER NUMBERS. THEY'RE THE ATOMIC ELEMENTS OF NUMBER THEORY. IN CHEMISTRY --
Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU MEAN ATOMIC ELEMENTS
IN CHEMISTRY ALL MATTER IS MADE UP OF ATOMS, AND IN MATH ALL NUMBERS ARE MADE UP OF WHOLE NUMBERS LIKE 15 IS 3 TIMES 5 EVERY NUMBER CAN BE --
Stephen:  I WANT TO CHECK THE MATH ON THAT ONE. HOLD ON. 3... THAT CHECKS OUT. ALL RIGHT, SO?
SO THEY'RE VERY FUNDAMENTAL IN MATHEMATICS. BUT DESPITE BEING SO FUNDAMENTAL, AND THEY'VE BEEN STUDIED SINCE THE ANCIENT GREEKS MORE THAN 2,000 YEARS AGO THERE'S A LOT WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT THEM.
Stephen: HOW MANY PRIME NUMBERS ARE THERE?
THEY GO ON FOREVER.
Stephen: THERE HAS TO BE A NUMBER OF THEM. THEY'RE NUMBERS, ERGO, THERE MUST BE A NUMBER OF THEM.
THERE'S AN INFINITY OF THEM. IT'S ANY NUMBER YOU WISH.
Stephen:  BUT THERE ARE NO MORE THAN INFINITY?
THERE'S ONLY AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THEM.
Stephen: ONLY AN INFINITE. THEY ARE LIMITED BY INFINITY.
YES.
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY. THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED TWIN PRIMES.
YES, TWIN PRIMES ARE  PAIRS OF PRIMES DISTANCED TWO APART, ALMOST AS CLOSE AS THEY COULD BE 5 AND 7. 11 AND 13. THESE ARE TWIN PRIMES.
Stephen:  WOULDN'T-- WOULDN'T-- WOULDN'T A TWIN PRIME BE 5 AND 5?
NO, THAT'S A PRIME TWICE.
Stephen: OH, REALLY?
YES.
Stephen: BUT THAT'S TWINS. TWINS ARE THE SAME PERSON TWICE.
WELL --
Stephen:  5 AND 7 TWO YEARS IS A LONG TIME FOR THE SECOND BABY TO STAY IN THE BIRTH CANAL.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: BEFORE IT COMES DOWN, OKAY? TWINS CANNOT BE TWO DIFFERENT AGES?
THE ANALOGY IS A LITTLE --
Stephen:  CHECK MATE, CHECK MATE.
FAIR ENOUGH YOU CAUGHT ME.
Stephen:  I GOT YA.
THESE ARE PAIRS OF PRIMES WHICH ARE TWO APART. AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE. SO YOU ASKED HOW MANY PRIMES THERE WERE. THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY. WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE INFINITELY TWIN PRIMES OR NOT. THIS IS ONE OF THE OLDEST QUESTIONS IN MATHEMATICS.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH ARE THE TWIN PRIMES  A FINITE RESOURCE OR DO THEY GO ON FOREVER? WE DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: WHAT'S A COUSIN PRIME? IS THERE A COUSIN--
OH! WOW, OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
COUSIN PRIMES ARE PAIRS OF PRIMES THAT ARE FOUR APART, LIKE 7 AND 11. THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS CLOSE AS TWINS PUT THEY'RE PRETTY CLOSE. AND THEN THERE ARE SEXY PRIMES.
Stephen: SEXY PRIMES?
SEXY PRIMES.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THEY?
THAT'S THE OFFICIAL TERM. PAIRS OF PRIMES THAT ARE SIX APART. SO WE DON'T KNOW THERE IS INFINITELY MANY TWIN PRIMES. INFINITELY MANY COUSIN PRIMES OR IF THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY SEXY PRIMES. BUT JUST THIS YEAR IT WAS PROVEN -- BASED ON A  HYPOTHESIS -- THAT ONE ONE OF THOSE THREE CLASSES WAS INFINITE.
Stephen: WAIT A MINUTE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IS INFINITE, BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM IS?
YES.
Stephen: HOW COULD YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM IS BUT NOT KNOW WHICH ONE? IS THIS LIKE "LET'S MAKE A DEAL?" THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT CURTAINS. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
THERE'S A FORMULA FOR HOW MANY TWIN PRIMES THERE ARE UP TO A CERTAIN POINT, AND HOW MANY SEXY PRIMES OR HOW MANY COUSIN PRIMES. AND YOU CAN ADD THEM UP. AND WE KNOW THE SUM IS INFINITE. ONE OF THE THREE IS INFINITE BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE. WE'LL PROBABLY FIGURE THEM OUT
Stephen: ARE COUSIN PRIMES EVER SEXY BUT YOU'RE AFRAID TO SAY IT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT SOUNDS CREEPY?
OH, DEAR. MAYBE SOME OF THE PRIMES, BUT, YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE NUMBER? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE ONE, RIGHT? WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE NUMBER?
IN MATHEMATICS YOU DON'T SORT OF TREAT ANY NUMBER WITH FAVORITISM.
Stephen: THE BEST NUMBER IS 5 BECAUSE THE JACKSON 5. BEN FOLDS 5. 5, IT'S FIVE.
OK
Stephen:  WELL WHAT'S NEXT? WHAT'S THE NEXT-- IF YOU WON THE PRIZE FOR THE FUTURE OF MATH, WHAT'S THE NEXT THING THAT'S HAPPENING IN MATH?
I AM WORKING ON FLUID EQUATIONS.
Stephen: ON WHAT EQUATIONS.
FLUID EQUATION.
Stephen:  FOOD?
FLUID. EQUATIONS THAT COVER THINGS LIKE WATER. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF WATER CAN SPONTANEOUSLY BLOW UP.
Stephen: TERENCE, THAT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Stephen: SO GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. KEEP IN TOUCH, PLEASE.
OKAY.
Stephen: TERENCE TAO, THANK YOU SO MUCH. U.C.L.A. MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR, TERENCE TAO. PRIME NUMBERS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
