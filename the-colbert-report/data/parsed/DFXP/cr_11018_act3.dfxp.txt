(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! LOOKING AT THE LATEST RESULTS, IT HAS BEEN A GOOD NIGHT SO FAR FOR REPUBLICANS. SOME OF THEM ARE EVEN STILL AWAKE TO CELEBRATE IT. AND IT IS OFFICIAL, THE G.O.P. HAS TAKEN THE SENATE AND EVERYTHING IS ABOUT TO CHANGE. CONSERVATIVES HAVE BIG PLANS FOR THIS COUNTRY. JUST ASK THE LIBERALS.
IF REPUBLICANS WIN, THE WILD MEN WILL BE COMING OUT FOR BLOOD. THEY'LL TRY TO KILL ObamaCare. FORGET IMMIGRATION REFORM, THEY'LL WANT HIGHER BORDER FENCES.
YOU WILL HAVE A HUGE PUSH TO OPEN PUBLIC LANDS FOR DRILLING.
YOU CAN COUNT ON PRESIDENT OBAMA BEING IMPEACHED.
Stephen: OH, YOU CAN COUNT ON OBAMA BEING IMPEACHED BECAUSE CONSERVATIVES LIKE ME CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SWEAR IN  PRESIDENT BIDEN. OH, GOD. OH, NO. THE POINT IS, THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ELECTION OF MY OR ANYONE'S LIFETIME. HERE TO AGREE WITH ME, FROM THE DISH,  BLOGGER AND UNRECONSTRUCTED OBAMA SUPPORTER ANDREW SULLIVAN, ANDREW SULLIVAN, EVERYBODY. WHOO! ANDREW! (APPLAUSE) GOOD TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GREAT.
Stephen: IT MUST BE A ROUGH NIGHT FOR YOU. CAN I GET YOU A DRINK OR SOMETHING STRONGER LIKE A REVOLVER? HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH THIS CRUSHING DEFEAT FOR THE DEMOCRATS?
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S A MIDTERM ELECTION IN THE SECOND TERM OF A PRESIDENT AND --
Stephen: ALWAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT.
WELL WITH, NORMALLY YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO GAIN ABOUT SEVEN SEATS AND LOOKS LIKE THEY'LL GAIN ROUGHLY AROUND THAT. SO IT'S NOT OUT OF THE ORDINARY FOR MIDTERM IN THE SECOND TERM OF A PRESIDENT.
Stephen: WHATEVER LETS YOU CRY YOURSELF TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. (LAUGHTER) DO YOU STILL SUPPORT OBAMA?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: BUT THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T SUPPORT OBAMA, THEY DIDN'T -- THEY RAN AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT, AND LOOK HOW IT HELPED THEM.
YES. (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT A DEMOCRAT, NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO'S ACTUALLY GOT A TERRIFIC ECONOMIC RECORD COMPARED TO ANY OTHER DEVELOPED NATION ON THE PLANET. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT A REAL CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE WE DON'T COMPARE OURSELVES TO OTHER NATIONS. THERE'S THE UNITED STATES AND THERE'S JUST OTHER PLACES.
HERE'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY. YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT ENACT UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH IS THEIR GOAL FOR 40 YEARS AND THEY RUN AWAY FROM THAT ACHIEVEMENT AND REFUSE TO TALK ABOUT IT. THEY'RE WEAK-KNEED, LILY-LIVERED COWARDS WHEN IT COMES TO REALLY FIGHTING THE FIGHT. I AM STILL KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND TEMPERAMENTALLY REPUBLICAN BUT I AM SUPPORTING THIS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OKAY. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS NOW FOR POLITICS IN WASHINGTON? BECAUSE NOW OBAMA CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE, AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS WHEN HE DOESN'T GET ANYTHING DONE.
IN SOME WAYS, I THINK THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING TONIGHT IS NOT THE SENATE BUT THE HOUSE, THE GAINS THE REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE IN THE HOUSE.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THEY? I HAVEN'T PAID ANY ATTENTION.
I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBERS NOW.
Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW. SO WE'RE THE  UNINFORMORED, INFLUENCING EACH OTHER IN REALTIME.
THEY GAINED AROUND 10 SEATS AND CHUCK TODD, WHO HAS BEEN THE ORACLE IN THIS, ARGUED THAT THEIR GRIP IS SO TIGHT IN THE HOUSE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE GOTTEN RID OF IN THE HOUSE UNTIL 2022, WHICH MEANS ANY DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT FROM NOW ON WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH AN EXTREMELY  CONSERVATIVE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Stephen: THE REAL PROBLEM I HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS IS THE DEMOCRATS DON'T COME OUT AND VOTE IN MIDTERMS. LOW TURNOUT FAVORS THE REPUBLICANS. WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET MORE AMERICANS TO VOTE? SHOULD WE HAVE THE "I VOTED" STICKERS DEEP FRIED? BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE PRETTY TASTELESS (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
NEXT ELECTION IS THE FIRST ELECTION AS AN IMMIGRANT I'LL BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY VOTE.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE YOUR CITIZENSHIP NOW?
NOT YET. IT WILL COME THROUGH IN THE NEXT YEAR AND I'LL BE ABLE TO VOTE.
Stephen: ANDREW, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME! ANDREW SULLIVAN! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
