[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS  NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY FOR HIS  PORTRAYAL OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS  CONGRESSMAN. BUT HE MIGHT LOSE TO EVERY OTHER  CONGRESSMAN. PLEASE WELCOME KEVIN SPACEY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANKS FOR COMING BACK. NICE TO SEE YOU. NICE SUIT.
THANK YOU. Stephen: YOU LOOK LIKE AN  EXTRA IN "TO KILL A  MOCKINGBIRD."  ATTICA'S STUNT DOUBLE. THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.
I WAS TRYING TO GIVE YOU THAT  SOUTHERN FEELING TODAY.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT IT  BARYKS. YOU'VE GOT IT. YOU WERE HERE FOR MANY REASONS. OTHER THAN YOU LIKE HANGING OUT  OBVIOUSLY BUT YOU ARE A FAMED  ACTOR, WRITER, DIRECTOR, TWO-TIME OSCAR WINNER, CURRENTLY  STAR OF THE NETFLIX SERIES  "HOUSE OF CARDS" IN WHICH YOU  PLAY... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. I DID READ THAT WELL. AND NOMINATED FOR NINE EMMYS,  THIS SHOW. NINE! WOW! OKAY. I'VE GOT A BEEF ABOUT THIS  THOUGH. KEV...
ME OR THE SHOW. Stephen: IT'S NOT A TV SHOW. IT'S AN INTERNET SHOW. I HAVE A TV SHOW, OKAY. YOU ARE ADMITTEDLY THE JACKIE  ROBINSON OF THE INTERNET. YOU ARE BRINGING THE SHOW... WHY  SHOULD YOU GET AN AWARD FOR TV  WHEN YOU'RE NOT ON TV? WHAT DO YOU WANT NEXT, THE  HEISMAN? DEFEND YOURSELF.
LOOK, IT'S WHERE THINGS HAVE  BEEN GOING FOR THE LAST, YOU  KNOW, YOU LOOK AT THE LAST EIGHT YEARS THE WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE  ARE WATCHING, BINGEING ON SHOWS. IT ALL STARTED WITH THE BOX. THE TRUTH IS I THINK THAT'S BEEN  REMARKABLE ABOUT HOW THE  AUDIENCE HAS RESPONDED TO HOUSE OF CARDS COMING OUT ALL AT ONCE  ALL 1 OF THE FIRST SEASON CAME  OUT IS THAT THEY ARE IN CONTROL. THEY CAN WATCH IT HOW THEY WANT  TO WATCH IT. IF THEY WANT TO BINGE, THEY CAN. IF THEY WANT TO WATCH TWO, THEY  CAN. IF THEY WANT TO WATCH NONE, LIKE  YOU, THEY DON'T HAVE TO.
Stephen: YOUR CHARACTER  REPRESENTS THE FIFTH DISTRICT IN  SOUTH CAROLINA. MY HOME STATE GREAT PLACE.
I WAS RECENTLY THERE. Stephen: OKAY. BUT HE'S A DEMOCRAT. YOU ARE A WHITE DEMOCRAT FROM  SOUTH CAROLINA. IS THIS THE SHOW THAT'S GOT THE  DRAGONS IN IT TOO? BECAUSE THIS SEEMS LIKE FANTASY  TO ME. I'M FROM THERE, BUDDY. WHO DREAMT THAT UP AND WHAT WERE  THEY SMOKING?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY  WERE SMOKING. BUT I HOPE THEY SMOKED AT LEAST  TWO OF THEM TO GET THERE. LOOK, IT'S OBVIOUSLY A FICTIONAL  SHOW BECAUSE IT'S ALSO A  CONGRESS [BLEEP] GETS DONE.
Stephen: IS YOUR CHARACTER  FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANT STUFF  LIKE REPEALING OBAMA CARE? IS THERE ANY VOTES ON THAT YET?
IN OUR FIRST SEASON WE PASSED  AN EDUCATION BILL.
Stephen: YEAH. AMAZING. Stephen: DID THIS MAKE  POLITICS APPEALING TO YOU ALL IN  ANYWAY?
DO YOU HAVE A BUCKET? Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO  DROP IN ALL THE REASONS WHY? THE REASON I ASK IS THAT I'M NOT  AN ACTOR BUT I KNOW SOME  HOLLYWOOD FOLK. AND I'VE MET A LOT OF WASHINGTON  PEOPLE. AND WHICH DO YOU THINK IS IS  MORE SELF-CENTERED HOLLYWOOD OR  WASHINGTON BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SAID THAT WASHINGTON IS JUST  HOLLYWOOD FOR UNATTRACTIVE  PEOPLE. WHICH DO YOU THINK IS MORE OF AN  OOKY SOCIETY TO BE IN?
I GET TO LIVE IN BOTH WORLDS  SO I REALLY GET THE BEST OF THE  ICKINESS.
Stephen: HOW WOULD YOU  COMPARE, WELL, THE SELFISHNESS,  THAT IS INHERENT IN IN HOLLYWOOD AND THE SELFISHNESS THAT  UNFORTUNATELY IS ENDEMIC IN  WASHINGTON?
HERE'S THE GREAT THING. I MOVED TO LONDON TEN YEARS AGO  SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO IN THE  SELFISHNESS OF HOLLYWOOD. AND WE SHOOT IN BALTIMORE SO  WE'RE NOT REALLY IN D.C. SO I  KIND OF MANAGED TO AVOID IT ALL.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER RUN  INTO THOSE GUYS FROM "THE WIRE"? HAVE YOU HEARD OF THOSE GUYS  FROM THE WIRE?
AND THEY WERE CANCELED. LOOK, IT'S BEEN FASCINATING  WATCHING HOW PEOPLE IN  WASHINGTON -- BECAUSE I'VE MET A NUMBER OF THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO  DO THIS JOB, KEVIN McCARTHY  WHO IS THE MAJORITY WHIP AND STENY HOYER WHO IS THE MINORITY  WHIP.
Stephen: ARE YOU MODELED ON  ANYONE.
NOT REALLY. WHEN THIS CHARACTER WAS WRITTEN  IT WAS BASED ON RICHARD III.
Stephen: THE HUNCH BACK KING. WHICH IS WHY IN THE SERIES I  TURN AND I TALK DIRECTLY TO THE  AUDIENCE, MUCH THE SAME WAY YOU DO HERE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. ALTHOUGH IN MY CASE THEY LISTEN.
Stephen: YOU HAVEN'T WON THAT  EMMY YET, KEV. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THANK YOU. KEVIN SPACEY, "HOUSE OF CARDS,"
