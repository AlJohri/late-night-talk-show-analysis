Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A HIGH  SCHOOL DROPOUT WHO SOLD HIS  INTERNET START-UP FOR $1.1  BILLION. JUST IMAGINE HOW MUCH HE COULD  HAVE MADE IF HE DROPPED OUT OF  GRADE SCHOOL. PLEASE WELCOME DAVID KARP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: YOU ARE FOUNDER AND  CEO OF TUMBLR.
TUMBLR. Stephen: YOU BECAME  SUCCESSFUL WITH THIS, WHAT DID  YOU CALL IT?
I STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO. Stephen: YOU DON'T THINK  YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL.
NOT YET. I HAVE LOTS TO PROVE. WE HAVE TO GET THINGS TO  PROFITABILITY. THAT'S A PRETTY BIG MILESTONE.
Stephen: NOT YOUR PROBLEM  ANYMORE. YOU JUST SOLD IT TO YAHOO.
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. Stephen: WHY DID YOU FOUND  TUMBLR TO BEGIN WITH.
I WAS AN ASPIRING CREATOR  GLOWING UP. THERE WAS A SET OF TOOLS THAT  WAS MISSING, SOMETHING THAT I  WANTED TO EXPRESS MYSELF OUT THERE IN THE WORLD. I DON'T HAVE A TV SHOW.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE A TV  SHOW. AM I WITH MY TV SHOW, AM I KIND  OF TUMBLING RIGHT NOW? I'M ON TUMBLR.
ALL RIGHT. I DON'T FOLLOW YOU YET. WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS ON TUMBLR.
Stephen: I WON'T TELL YOU. FIND ME. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE  TUMBLR NOW.
WHAT DO I DO ON THERE? IT'S PRIVATE.
Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE  ON THE TUMBLR.
ABOUT 120 MILLION BLOGS ON  TUMBLR AND A FEW HUNDRED MILLION  PEOPLE THAT READ THOSE BLOGS.
Stephen: UNLIKE BILL GATES OR  STEVE JOBS YOU DID NOT DROP OUT  OF COLLEGE BUT YOU DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.
I DROPPED OUT THE SUMMER I  TURNED 15 GOING INTO MY  SOPHOMORE YEAR.
Stephen: WHY? YOU SEEM LIKE A SMART ENOUGH  KID.
THIS WAS 12 OR 13 YEARS AGO. I WAS GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL IN  NEW YORK. I KNEW I WANTED TO WORK WITH  COMPUTERS AND WRITE SOFTWARE. I WAS PRETTY SURE I WANTED TO DO  STUFF ON THE INTERNET. REWIND 12, 13 YEARS. THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF  COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IN  SCHOOLS, IN HIGH SCHOOLS IN NEW YORK CITY AT THE TIME. I TELL YOUNG PEOPLE OUGHT TIME  WHO ASK ME WHAT SHOULD THEY BE  DOING, THEY'RE BORED IN SCHOOL. YOU CAN GET A GREAT COMPUTER  SCIENCE EDUCATION IN GRADE  SCHOOL TODAY. GO FOR IT. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. IT WASN'T AN OPPORTUNITY I HAD  WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT YOUNG  KIDS TO STAY IN SCHOOL.
ABSOLUTELY. Stephen: BECAUSE YOU'RE  PULLING THE LADDER UP BEHIND  YOU. YAHOO IS NOT THE HIPPEST OUTFIT. DID THEY BUY YOU TO BUY YOUR  COOL?
NO, LOOK. I THINK... I HOPE NOT. I THINK YAHOO IS... I KNOW YAHOO  IS LOOKING FOR A PATH FORWARD. THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF  THEIR BUSINESS AND BUILDING  STUFF THAT IS RELEVANT TO MANY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE  YEARS FROM NOW. THEY SAW TUMBLR AS A BIG PART OF  THAT.
Stephen: BUT TUMBLR IS COOL. I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE WE'RE  AUTHENTIC. WE'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT IS  IMPORTANT TO US AND WE'RE  SERVING A COMMUNITY.
Stephen: WHY WON'T YOU USE  THE WORD COOL AND YOU DON'T KNOW  WHAT COOL IS? I'M SERIOUS. IT'S A TESTING GROUND. YOU NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH  CAFETERIA TABLES. YOU MIGHT BE A COOL KID. YOU MIGHT BE A BURNOUT. YOU MIGHT BE A HEATHER OR A MEAN  GIRL. DO YOU HAVE ANY WHAT THAT IS  LIKE?
NO. Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WITH  TUMBLR, OKAY? LET ME PAINT A PICTURE OF THE HE  WILL FAPT. IT'S ON ITS BACK AND ITS  STRETCHED ARE STRETCHED. OKAY.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON  THERE?
Stephen: IT'S PORN CENTRAL. THERE'S A TON OF PORN ON THERE.
THERE'S A LOT OF EVERYTHING. Stephen: THERE'S A LOT OF  EVERYTHING ON THERE. THERE'S A LOT. IS THAT GOING TO STAY ON THERE?
LOOK, WE'VE TAKEN A PRETTY  HARD LINE ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH,  SUPPORTING OUR USERS, CREATION, WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE. JUST NOT SOMETHING WE WANT TO  POLICE. WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE  TERRY RICHARDSON OR ANY NUMBER  OF VERY TALENTED PHOTOGRAPHERS POSTING TASTEFUL PHOTOGRAPHY, I  DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO IN  THERE TO DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN THIS PHOTO AND THIS  BEHIND-THE-SCENES PHOTO LADY GAG  AND HER NIPS.
Stephen: I THINK WE'RE GOING  TO HAVE TO BLEEP THAT. I'M JUST NOT SURE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE A BIG-TIME PLAYER. YOU'RE A BIG-TIME PLAYER IN THE  INTERNET NOW. N.S.A. COMES TO YOU, THE  NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY COMES  TO YOU AND SAYS, HEY, GIVE ME ALL THE INFORMATION ON YOUR  PEOPLE. WE THINK ONE OF THOSE GUYS  POSTING NIP-SLIPS WITH LADY GAGA  IS PLANNING SOME BAD STUFF SO WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION  ON EVERYONE ON YOUR SIDE. WHAT DO YOU SAY?
THAT'S A COMPLICATED  QUESTION, STEPHEN. YOU'RE PUTTING ME ON THE SPOT.
Stephen: YES OR NO. I'M THE N.S.A. HEY, YOU, WE WILL TURN YOU INTO  QUELLCALM. WE'RE GOING TO MIND-SPACE YOUR  ASS UNLESS YOU GIVE US THE  INFORMATION.
WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU  ANYTHING THAT'S NOT IN THE BEST  INTEREST OF OUR USERS. WE FOUGHT FOR THAT FOR SIX  YEARS.
Stephen: JUST TELL US WHAT  STEPHEN COLBERT POSTED ON HIS  SITE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND YOU. Stephen: AND YOU NEVER WILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOUNDER AND CEO OF TUMBLR, DAVID
