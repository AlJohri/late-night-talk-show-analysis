(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. NATION, I HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD WEEKEND. I KNOW I DID. FOLKS, WHAT AN INCREDIBLE AND EXCITING WEEKEND. I DONE KNOW IF YOU HAD TIME TO DO THIS, I DON'T KNOW-- THANKS. FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD TIME TO CATCH UP ON YOUR TV VIEWING THIS WEEKEND. I HOPE DID YOU BECAUSE IF YOU DID, FOLKS, IF YOU MANAGED TO WATCH SOME TV THIS WEEKEND, I HOPE YOU CAUGHT UP ON THE NFL DRAFT. BECAUSE IT'S ONLY PLACE THESE DAYS YOU CAN STILL SEE COLLEGE GRADUATES GETTING JOBS. AS ALWAYS THE BIG STORY WAS WHICH PLAYER WOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE PICK. OF THE LAST 8 PICKS OF THE 7th ROUND.
IN THE 2014 NFL DRAFT, THE ST. LOUIS RAMS SELECT MICHAEL SAM DEFENSIVE END.
MICHAEL SAM DRAFTED BY THE ST. LOUIS RAMS BECOMING THE FIRST OPENLY GAY PLAYER EVER DRAFTED.
Stephen: FIRST OPENLY GAY PLAYER, IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE ALL HAD OUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DALLAS COWBOYS MASCOT ROWDY. ME THINKS HE DOTH KERCHIEF TOO MUCH. AND MICHAEL SAM'S WAR ON TRADITIONAL GRIDIRON VALUES STARTED AS SOON AS HE GOT THE PHONE CALL.
THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE MICHAEL SAM GOT THE NEWS THAT HE IS GOING TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ST. LOUIS RAMS. THERE YOU SEE THE RAW EMOTION. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: HOLDING! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: HOLDING! UNNECESSARY TENDERNESS. FOLKS THIS IS JUST WRONG. IN THE NFL SEXUALITY IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE OFF CAMERA. AND THE FANS SHOULD ONLY FIND OUT ABOUT IT WHEN THE CHARGES ARE FILED. FOLK, I'M UPSET AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.
JONES OF THE DOLPHINS TWEETED OMG AND HORRIBLE.
FORMER SUPER BOWL CHAMPION TWEETED QUOTE I'M SORRY BUT THAT MICHAEL SAM IS NO BUENO FOR DOING THAT ON NATIONAL TV. MAN YOU, YOU GOT LITTLE KIDS LOOKING AT THE DRAFT.
Stephen: YEAH, NO BUENO. KIDS ARE WATCHING. NOW WE'LL HAVE TO ANSWER THEIR UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS LIKE DADDY, CAN WE STOP WATCHING THE 7th ROUND OF THE NFL DRAFT? IT'S BEEN 48 HOURS AND I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP. (APPLAUSE) LISTEN UP, YOU CAN SLEEP ONCE THE STEELERS FILL THE HOLES IN THEIR SECONDARY, YOUNG MAN. NOW FOLKS DON'T GET ME WRONG, I'M A TOLERANT GUY, I DON'T CARE WHO YOU LOVE AS LONG AS YOU CAN LAUNCH YOUR BODY AT ANOTHER MAN'S SKULL LIKE A MISSILE MADE OF PURE HATE BUT THIS KISS MADE PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE. JUST ASK AN EXPERT ON MAKING PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE.
I THOUGHT WHEN HE, YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS REALLY GOING AT IT, I MEAN WHETHER-- I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN A WHILE, HE WAS REALLY GOING AT IT.
YEAH, THEY WERE REALLY GOING AT IT THAT IS SOME HARD-CORE CLOSED LIP BRIEF AND AFFECTIONATE PECKING. FOLKS, I SAY THAT THAT KISS THAT KISS ALONE PROVES THAT SAM SHOULDN'T BE IN THE NFL. HE SHOULD BE IN THE MLB BECAUSE THE MOMENT HE WAS DRAFTED HE HEADED TO FIRST BASE.
NATION-- SORRY, NATION, I LOVE A GOOD COMEBACK STORY, THAT'S WHY MY FAVORITE ROCKY MOVIE IS THE ONE WITH ROCKY IN IT. SO I WAS THRILLED TO HEAR THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST STARS OF THE 1990s IS MAKING A HUGE COMEBACK.
MONICA LEWINSKY, THAT'S HER RIGHT THERE.
SHE'S WRITTEN AN ARTICLE IN "VANITY FAIR".
SHE'S BACK.
YUP, SHE'S BACK.
SHE'S BACK.
GUESS WHO'S BACK.
YES, SHE'S BACK. THAT'S WHY WE SOUND SO UPSET. LEWINSKY WROTE THE COVER STORY FOR THIS MONTH'S "VANITY FAIR" TITLED SHAME AND SURVIVOR. IT'S LIKE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ONLY THE HEROINE ISN'T THE ONE WHO GOT THE HAPPY ENDING. FOR THOSE OF YOU BORN AFTER THE LEWINSKY SCANDAL FIRST, CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING YOUR LEARNER'S PERMIT. SECOND, MONICA LEWINSKY IS THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE INTERN WHOSE AFFAIR WITH BILL CLINTON PARALYZED OUR GOVERNMENT AS CONGRESS ATTACKED THE PRESIDENT WITH A PATHOLOGICAL HOSTILITY, BUT HE WAS WHITE SO IT BACKFIRED. NOW LEWINSKY'S RETURN IS GREAT NEWS FOR REPUBLICANS BECAUSE THIS REMINDER OF THE DARKEST CHAPTER OF THE CLINTON LEGACY COMES RIGHT BEFORE HILLARY LAUNCHES HER 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. NOW THAT CAMPAIGN IS OVER. IT'S DONE, TAKE TAFT'S BATHTUB OUT OF STORAGE BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING PRESIDENT CHRIS CHRISTIE.
Stephen: IT'S EXACTLY WHAT HILLARY WANTS US TO THINK. BECAUSE IN REALITY, THIS IS ALL PART OF HER PLAN.
I HONESTLY THINK THIS IS PART OF THE CLINTON PLAN OF SORT OF TRYING TO GET THIS OUT THERE NOW.
WHY NOW? THERE'S A LOT OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES FLOATING OUT ON THE TIMING OF THIS ARTICLE.
THE TIMING IS CERTAINLY COMING UNDER QUESTION.
Stephen: YES, THE TIMING IS CERTAINLY COMING UNDER QUESTION. WHAT QUESTIONS? WELL, THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE. BUT ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS? THAT MAKES TWO. AND FOLKS WHENS THERE'S A CONSPIRACY AFOOT I FIND THE TRUTH IN MY LONG TWICE RUNNING SEGMENT STEPHEN COLBERT'S [BLEEP] SERIOUS. NATION, PREPARE TO HAVE YOUR MIND BLOWN AS I EXPOSE THE SECRET NETWORKS OF POWER CONSPIRING TO CONTROL OUR EVERY MOVE FOR INSTANCE SOMEHOW MY TELEPROMPTER KNOWS EVERYTHING I'M GOING TO SAY BEFORE I SAY IT. LIKE THIS SENTENCE I'M SAYING RIGHT NOW NO MATTER HOW FAST I SAY IT, EGGPLANT, TUBE SOCK, POTATO SALAD, ALL THOSE WORDS ARE ALREADY IN THERE. FOLKS, HILLARY WAS BEHIND THIS ARTICLE JUST AS SURELY AS SHE WAS BEHIND THE WOMAN WHO THREW A SHOE AT HER LAST MONTH. I MEAN IF SHE WERE NOT AN EVIL MANIPULATER WHY IS MY IMPRESSION OF HER THIS. (APPLAUSE) BUT THE QUESTION IS WHY DID HILLARY WANT THIS NEWS OUT NOW.
TIMING OF IT BENEFITS HILLARY, IT IS GOOD TO GET IT OUT THERE TALK ABOUT IT, AND DON'T HIDE WAITING FOR IT, YOU KNOW, TO REAR ITS HEAD AGAIN.
I REALLY WONDER IF THIS ISN'T AN EFFORT ON THE CLINTON'S PART TO GET THAT STORY OUT OF THE WAY.
RUTH MARCUS WROTE IN THE "WASHINGTON POST" IF AND WHEN A CLINTON PRESIDENTIAL ANNOUNCEMENT COMES LEWINSKY IS GOING TO BE OLD NEWS.
Stephen: HILLARY IS TRYING TO MAKE THIS 16-YEAR-OLD NEWS OLD NEWS. YOU SEE IF WE TALK ABOUT THE LEWINSKY SCANDAL NOW THEN WE WON'T BE TALKING ABOUT IT WHEN SHE'S RUNNING IN 2016, BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING THE CONSERVATIVE MEDIA IS KNOWN FOR IT IS LETTING THINGS GO. UNLESS, WAIT, UNLESS THAT'S JUST WHAT SHE WANTS US TO THINK SHE WANTS US TO THINK SHE THINKS. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THE PRINCESS OF DARKNESS ALWAYS HAS AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE, RIGHT ERIC BOLLING.
THE THEORY THAT I'M HEARING IS THIS COULD BE COMPLETELY OFF BASE.
Stephen: A GOOD CHANCE THIS IS [BLEEP] GO AHEAD.
IS THAT THIS PROVIDES SYMPATHY FOR HILLARY TO REMIND  EVERYONE THAT BILL CLINTON WAS A JERK.
Stephen: BUSTED! SHE WANTS US TO SAY OH, POOR HILLARY. HER HUSBAND WAS SUCH A JERK. LET'S ELECT HER SO  HE COULD BE BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE BUT WITH MORE FREE TIME. BUT IF HILLARY REALLY INSTRUCTED "VANITY FAIR" TO PRINT MONICA LEWINSKY'S ARTICLE THERE MUST BE A PAPER TRAIL. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN CONTROL THE MEDIA WITH HER MIND. OR CAN SHE? JIM?
YOU'RE SAYING YOU ARE NODDING THAT WOULD MEAN THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME LEVEL OF COLLUSION WITH THE CLINTONS.
THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BECAUSE THE MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS CAN COMMUNICATE WITHOUT TALKING.
Stephen: AHA!! THE MEDIA CAN COMMUNICATE WITH DEMOCRATS BY READING THEIR THOUGHTS! BUT FOX NEWS CAUGHT THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN COMMUNICATE WITHOUT THINKING AT ALL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NAILED YOU. NAIL. AND FOLKS THIS CLOCK GOES BACK DECADES. BACK IN 1995 HILLARY CLEARLY GAVE MONICA ONE OF HER DEMOCRATIC PSYCHIC GAZES SECOND THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR GIVE THE HUMMER TO MY HUSBAND IN THE OVAL OFFICE SO THAT 19 YEARS LATER WE CAN COMBINE FORCES TO PUBLISH AN ARTICLE THAT WILL HELP MY PRESIDENTIAL CHANCES. IF I'VE SEEN IT ONCE, I'VE SEEN IT A THOUSAND TIMES. AND, AND I HAVE SEEN IT ONCE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NEED MORE PROOF? THEN YOU'RE WATCHING THE WRONG SHOW. (LAUGHTER) THAT IS IT FOR ANOTHER EDITION OF STEPHEN COLBERT'S [BLEEP], TUNE IN NEXT TIME WHEN I ASK HOW DID YOU KNOW I WOULD BE DOING THIS SEGMENT AGAIN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
