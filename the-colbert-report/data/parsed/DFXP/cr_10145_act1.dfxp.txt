(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS! IT IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT THE COLBERT NATION IS STANDING STRONG NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS ALL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE, FOLKS, FOR MONTHS, THE WORLD HAS BEEN SHOCKED BY THE BRUTAL TERRORIST GROUP I.S.I.S. DON'T BE FOOLED JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE SAME NAME YOUR LONELY AUNT GAVE HER CAT. (LAUGHTER) THESE GUYS ARE PURE EVIL. TV, SCARE ME TILL IT'S BROWN DOWNTOWN!
I.S.I.S. IS BRUTAL? THEY ARE ANIMALS -- BEHEADINGS, CRUCIFIXIONS, MASS EXECUTIONS OR LIVE BURIALS, ENSLAVEMENT OF WOMEN. THEY CERTAINLY AREN'T THE J.V. TEAM OF AL QUAIDA. THEY'RE THE GREEN BAY PACKERS.
Stephen: YES, THEY'RE THE GREEN BAY PACKERS, BUT WITH BEHEADINGS. SO SLIGHTLY LESS HEAD TRAUMA THAN the N.F.L. AND YES -- (APPLAUSE) -- YES, THE U.S. DID HIT I.S.I.S. WITH AIRSTRIKES IN IRAQ. BUT THAT JUST DROVE THEM BACK INTO SYRIA, WHERE, LAST WEEK THEY CAPTURED A MAJOR AIR BASE. ALTHOUGH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD THAT WILL DO, SINCE I'M GUESSING THEY'RE ALL ON THE "NO FLY" LIST. (LAUGHTER) THINK, GUYS! SO WHO EXACTLY IS "IS-IS? (LAUGHTER) ACCORDING TO THE "THE NEW YORK TIMES," THE GROUP HAS "THE GROUP HAS QUIETLY BUILT AN EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE OF MOSTLY MIDDLE MIDDLE-AGED IRAQIS. AND THEIR LEADER, ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI, HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS "A BALDING, MIDDLE AGED MAN." (LAUGHTER) IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'RE 40-SOMETHINGS HAVING A MID-LIFE ISIS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU KNOW HOW IT IS! WE'VE ALL SEEN IT. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, YOU SEE YOUR YOUTH SLIPPING AWAY, SO YOU GO OUT AND GET AN EXOTIC NEW SPORTS TANK, AND CHEAT ON YOUR WIFE WITH ONE OF YOUR OTHER WIVES. AND YOU TRY TO DIET, BUT YOU STILL CAN'T FIT INTO YOUR HIGH SCHOOL SUICIDE VEST. WORST OF ALL, ISIS HAS NOW ATTRACTED THE MOST VIOLENT, HEAVILY-ARMED PEOPLE ON EARTH -- AMERICANS.
NEW DETAILS EMERGING ABOUT AMERICAN JIHADIST DOUGLAS McCAIN. HE WASN'T THE ONLY TERRORIST TO COME FROM ROBBINSDALE COOPERS HIGH SCHOOL IN MINNESOTA. WE NOW KNOW TROY CASTAGAR WHO WENT OVERSEAS TO FIGHT IN AN AL QUAIDA GROUP WITH McCAIN'S CLASSMATE. THERE COULD BE A THIRD TERRORIST FROM ROBBINSDALE COOPERS HIGH SCHOOL THIS GUNMEN IS WEARING A SHIRT SAYING COOPER HAWKS,  THE SAME AS THE HIGH SCHOOL MASCOT.
Stephen: THE COOPER HAWKS! THAT TEAM LEAVES IT "ALL" OUT ON THE FIELD. ESPECIALLY AFTER A DRONE STRIKE. THEIR PROM THEME THIS YEAR WAS ISRAEL UNDER THE SEA. (LAUGHTER) AND WHILE ISIS IS A RELATIVELY NEW TERROR GROUP, THIS CONFLICT HAS ITS ROOTS IN THE SEVENTH-CENTURY SUNNI-SHIITE SPLIT, WITH SUNNI'S FOLLOWING MUHAMMED'S FATHER-IN-LAW ABU BAKR, WHILE SHIITES FOLLOW MUHAMMED'S SON-IN-LAW ALI. SO, IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS OBAMA'S FAULT.
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS DERELICT IN HIS DUTIES TO GET AHEAD OF THIS PROBLEM AND PROTECT THE HOMELAND.
WE HAVE A RUDDERLESS SITUATION IN A DANGEROUS WORLD. EVERYONE IS HOLDING THEIR BREATH. FOR THE PRESIDENT NOT TO ACT POLITICALLY, ACT LIKE THE MAN OF THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOUR FAMILY THE UNITED STATES HERE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!
Stephen: YEAH, ACT LIKE A MAN! STEP UP. TAKE WHAT YOU WANT. YES, YOU WANTED TO BOMB SYRIA LAST YEAR AND WE SAID NO, BUT SOMETIMES NO MEANS YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS GUY NEEDS A HARD DOSE OF REALITY. RIGHT, WOMAN WHO LIVES IN A WORLD OF IMAGINATION?
CAN I MAKE A SPECIAL REQUEST IN THE MAGIC LAND? WE GET NETANYAHU, PUTIN IN FOR 48 HOURS, HEAD OF THE UNITED STATES, I DON'T KNOW, JUST WANT SOMEBODY TO GET IN HERE AND GET IT DONE RIGHT:
Stephen: YES! PUTIN OR NETANYAHU, OR BETTER YET, COMBINE THEM INTO PRESIDENT NETAN-PUT-HU! SHIRTLESS, BUT WITH NIPPLE YARMULKES. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) COME IN HANDY IF YOU'RE RUNNING A MARATHON OR SOMETHING. BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE MAKING (BLEEP) UP, AS A CONSERVATIVE, MY ALLEGIANCE IS WITH AN EVEN GREATER IMAGINARY LEADER: RONALD REAGAN. 'HE'S' THE ONE WE SHOULD BE PRETENDING IS STOPPING THIS CRISIS. AND NEWT GINGRICH AGREES YESTERDAY, NEWT POSTED A LENGTHY FAKE SPEECH HE IMAGINES REAGAN WOULD GIVE IF HE WERE STILL AROUND. AND IT IS EXACTLY WHAT REAGAN WOULD SAY IF HE WERE STILL ALIVE, AND SOMEHOW STILL PRESIDENT SERVING A NINTH TERM AT THE AGE OF 103. QUOTH REAGAN, QUOTH NEWT: "DEFEATING TERRORISTS AND BLACKMAILERS IS NOTHING NEW IN AMERICAN HISTORY. JEFFERSON HATED WAR AND LOVED PEACE. HE ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN VICIOUS OPPONENTS GIVE PEACE-LOVING PEOPLE NO CHOICE BUT TO ENGAGE IN JUST WAR." AND IF NEWT KNOWS EXACTLY HOW JEFFERSON FELT, I'M SURE HE WILL ALSO WRITE A FICTIONAL SPEECH THAT JEFFERSON WOULD HAVE GIVEN IN 1984, WHEN REAGAN DECIDED TO GET OUR MARINES THE HELL OUT OF LEBANON. FAKE JEFFERSON WOULD BE JUST AS DISAPPOINTED IN REAL REAGAN AS FAKE REAGAN IS IN REAL OBAMA. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT NEWT WILL IMAGINE FAKE OBAMA WILL ONE DAY SAY ABOUT THE MIDEAST POLICY OF  PRESIDENT BLUE IVY. (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) NATION, I, TOO, CAN IMAGINE OUR WAY TO A BETTER WORLD  BECAUSE, I, LIKE NEWT GINGRICH, BELIEVE WE CAN DEFEAT ISIS WITH THE POWER OF MAKE-BELIEVE. REMEMBER, IN 1938, THE RADIO BROADCAST OF WAR OF THE WORLDS MANAGED TO CONVINCE THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS THAT ALIENS WERE ATTACKING. WE CAN DO THE SAME THING TO ISIS AND CONVINCE THEM THAT REAGAN IS BACK IN CHARGE. (LIKE OLD TIMEY ANNOUNCER...) WE INTERRUPT THIS BROADCAST OF THE COLBERT REPORT TO BRING YOU A SPECIAL BULLETIN FROM THE INTERNATIONAL RADIO NEWS. AT TEN MINUTES AFTER 11:00, EASTERN TIME, A HUGE FLAMING OBJECT FELL ON A FARM IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF GROVERS MILL, NEW JERSEY. OBSERVERS REPORTED THAT IT WAS, IN FACT, RONALD REAGAN. PRESIDENT REAGAN IMMEDIATELY MOUNTED A NEARBY STALLION AND BEGAN RIDING TOWARD THE WHITE HOUSE. (HORSE-GALLOPING NOISE) HE THEN DISMOUNTED, WALKING OVER SOME DRY LEAVES. (CRUNCHES) IN A THUNDERSTORM. (METAL SHEET) BEFORE GETTING ON A FREIGHT TRAIN. (TRAIN EFFECT) AND THEN REAGAN THREW OPEN THE DOORS TO THE WHITE HOUSE. (DOOR OPENING SOUND) STRODE TO THE PODIUM. (SHOES) AND SAID -- MWAH, SEE? I'M IN CHARGE AROUND HERE, SEE? LISTEN UP, ISIS, AMSCRA, WHY DONCHA? OR I'LL GIVE YA THE BUSINESS! TEAR DOWN THAT WALL! DADDY WANTS SOME JELLYBEANS! MWAH! (LAUGHTER) GIVE DADDY A KISS, NANCY! WITH ISIS DEFEATED, REAGAN STEPPED DOWN FROM THE PODIUM AND WALKED OFF INTO THE SETTING SUN, JOINED BY PETER AND A FRIENDLY DUCK. (CLARINET SONG FROM PETER AND THE WOLF) TAKE THAT, ISIS! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.      (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
