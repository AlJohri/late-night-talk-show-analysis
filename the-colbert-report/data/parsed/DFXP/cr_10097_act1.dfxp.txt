Stephen: TONIGHT I CHECK IN ON THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, NO, DON'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL. THEN MORE BAD NEWS ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE. THE ORGANIST CHARGES DOUBLE TO PLAY HERE COMES THE BRIDE TWICE. AND MY GUEST AUDRA McDONALD STARS ON BROADWAY AS JAZZ GREAT BILLIE HOLIDAY. WONDER WHAT DISNEY PRINCESS THAT'S BASED ON. A NEW PROJECT WILL GIVE EACH M.I.T. UNDERGRAD STUDENT $100 WORTH OF BITCOINS. WAIT, $60 WORTH OF BITCOIN, NO WAIT, $800 WORTH OF BITCOIN THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEVE, STEPHEN.
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANKS, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, WE ARE COMING UP ON ELECTION SEASON AS A NEWSMAN, IT'S MY JOB TO BRING YOU THE LATEST, BASELESS SPECULATION ON WHO MIGHT BE RUNNING WHO IS THINKING ABOUT RUNNING AND WHO WAS RECENTLY SEEN RUNNING. (LAUGHTER) WHY IS HE RUNNING? IS IT BECAUSE HE'S RUNNING? WELL, ON MONDAY ONE DARK HORSE CANDIDATE HAS OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.
SYRIA'S PRESIDENT BASHAR ASSAD IS ANNOUNCING HIS CANDIDACY IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.
HE WILL RUN FOR A THIRD SEVEN YEAR TERM IN JUNE.
Stephen: BASHAR ASSAD HAS THROWN HIS HAT IN THE RING. AND BY HAT I MEAN NERVE GAS AND BY RING I MEAN PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) AND WHILE SYRIA IS TECHNICALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A CIVIL WAR, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WON THE PRESIDENCY IN THE MIDDLE OF A CIVIL WAR? LINCOLN. THAT IS WHERE THE SIMILARITIES END. NOW HE MAY BE UNPOPULAR BUT MY MONEY IS STILL ON ASSAD BECAUSE HE'S A TOUGH CAMPAIGNER. HE CAN GO VERY NEGATIVE BECAUSE HIS ATTACK ADS ARE ACTUAL ATTACKS. (LAUGHTER) MEANWHILE, ELECTORALLY BACK HERE IN AMERICA THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS ARE UPON US AND I COULD NOT BE MORE MID-EXCITED. I AM HALF PUMPED. BECAUSE, BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO GET WHIPPED LIKE ONE OF THEIR BELOVED SMOOTHIES. PINEAPPLE AND MANGO BLENDED TOGETHER AS ONE. I'M SORRY, THAT IS FRUIT SODOMY. BY THE WAY, DO NOT GOOGLE FRUIT SODOMY. (LAUGHTER) AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO THE PLUMMETING POPULARITY OF BARACK OBAMA.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S APPROVAL RATING TAKING A NOSEDIVE ACCORDING TO A NEW "WASHINGTON POST" ABC NEWS POLL, PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATING HAS HIT A NEW LOW, 41%.
Stephen: 41%. THAT MEANS HE'S ONLY 35% MORE POPULAR THAN CONGRESS. (LAUGHTER) AND THE BAD NEWS DOES NOT END THERE. BECAUSE THAT SAME "WASHINGTON POST" ABC NEWS POLL FOUND THAT 53% OF VOTERS SAY THEY WOULD RATHER SEE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS CONTROL OF CONGRESS. THAT IS GREAT NEWS, IF THE GOP TAKES BOTH HOUSES THEY'LL FINALLY BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THEIR IDEAS WHICH SHOULD REALLY MOTIVATE THEM TO HAVE AN IDEA. (LAUGHTER) NOW ANOTHER BLOW, ANOTHER BLOW TO THE DONKEY-CRAT HOPES IS THAT JUST 23% OF AMERICANS IN THE AGE OF 18 AND 29 SAY THEY WILL DEFINITELY BE VOTING IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT FOR SOME REASON COLLEGE STUDENTS AREN'T THRILLED BY THE WORD MIDTERM. AND--  (LAUGHTER) MILLENNIALS TEND TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS SO THEIR APATHY MAKES ME HAPPY. OR AS THE YOUNGSTERS SAY HASHTAG SAXOPHONE EMOJI. WITH ALL THIS BAD NEWS IT IS NO SURPRISE DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING HAIL MARYS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, CASE IN POINT NORTH CAROLINA'S DISTRICT WHICH IS CURRENTLY REPRESENTED BY REPUBLICAN CONGRESSWOMAN AND PERSON IN ALLERGY AD RENEE ELLMERS. SHE WON HER SEAT BY CAMPAIGNING ON AN ISSUE SO IMPORTANT TO THE NORTHERN MOST PART OF HER DISTRICT, MANHATTAN.
THE TERRORISTS HAVEN'T WON. AND WE SHOULD TELL THEM IN PLAIN ENGLISH, NO. THERE WILL NEVER BE A MOSQUE AT GROUND ZERO, I'M RENEE ELLMERS AND I APPROVE THIS AD.
Stephen: STRONG STATEMENT, OF COURSE THAT AD UPSET NORTH CAROLINA'S MUSLIM COMMUNITY, BOTH OF THEM. BUT THAT'S NOT ELLMERS ONLY ACCOMPLISHMENT. LAST FALL SHE ALSO VOTED TO SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. WHO CAN FORGET THE MESSAGE OF HOPE SHE SENT THOSE FEDERAL WORKERS THAT HER VOTE LAID OFF.
THE THING OF IT IS I NEED MY PAYCHECK. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE THERE ARE SOME OTHER MEMBERS WHO ARE, YOU KNOW, DEFERRING THEIR PAYCHECKS AND I THINK THAT IS ADMIRABLE. I'M NOT IN THAT POSITION.
Stephen: YES, SHE WASN'T IN THAT POSITION. AND NEITHER WERE THE WORKERS. THEY WERE BENDING OVER AND TAKING IT. AND IF SHE WEREN'T, IF SHE WEREN'T ENOUGH OF A SHOE-IN ALREADY, GET A LOAD OF WHO THE DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING AGAINST HER.
I'M CLAY AIKEN. YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY--  (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YES, I DO WONDER WHY YOU ARE RUNNING. IS IT BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYONE IN CONGRESS WITH SUCH GOLDEN PIPES SINCE SENATOR JOHN ASHCROFT ♪ LET THE EAGLE SOAR ♪ ♪ LIKE SHE'S NEVER SOARED BEFORE ♪ ♪.
Stephen: THAT NEVER FAILS TO BRING A TEAR TO MY EYE. (LAUGHTER) AND FOR SOME REASON BLOOD TO MY EARS. (LAUGHTER) NOW MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOLKS. I AM AN AIKEN FAN OR CLAYMATE. I VOTED FOR HIM THROUGH SEASON 2. WHEN HE LOST TO RUBEN STODDARD I WAS CRUSHED, ALMOST AS CRUSHED AS I WAS WHEN THEY VOTED OFF THAT OLD LADY. BUT I CANNOT SUPPORT CLAY AIKEN FOR CONGRESS. NOT ONLY IS HE A DEMOCRAT, HE IS ALSO A GAY WHICH I ONLY RECENTLY DISCOVERED WERE TWO SEPARATE THINGS. (LAUGHTER) AND I CANNOT BELIEVE HE'S TRYING TO GET RENEE ELLMERS FIRED. DOES HE NOT KNOW HOW BADLY SHE NEEDS HER PAYCHECK? IF HE WERE ON MY SHOW RIGHT NOW, I'D VOTE HIM OFF. HERE TO BE KICKED OUT OF MY STUDIO, PLEASE WELCOME FORMER AMERICAN ALMOST IDOL AND CANDIDATE FOR NORTH CAROLINA'S SECOND DISTRICT, CLAY AIKEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP. LISTEN UP. OKAY. I AM UNCHARMED BY THOSE BABY BLUES AND THOSE GOLDEN PIPES. WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, YOU HOLLYWOOD LIBERAL, COMING INTO NORTH CAROLINA WITH YOUR SAN FRANCISCO VALUES.
WELL, I THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY FED UP WITH THE KIND OF TONE DEAF REPRESENTATION THEY'VE HAD. YOU HEARD-- .
Stephen: TONE DEAF JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE PERFECT PITCH? THAT'S KIND OF CHEAP.
I MEAN YOU SEE WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH NOW. WE'VE GOT A REPRESENTATIVE NOW WHO HAS COMPLETELY IGNORED THE PEOPLE WHO SHE WAS ELECTED TO REPRESENT.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE COMPLETELY IGNORED THING. BUT HOW ARE YOU NOT GOING TO COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM.
WELL, I HAVE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE SINCE IDOL TRYING TO STAND UP FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. I STARTED AN ORGANIZATION FOR KIDS WITH DISABILITIES. AND HAVE BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS FOR THE PAST 11 YEARS. AND THESE PEOPLE IN NORTH CAROLINA PUT ME HERE. THEY GAVE ME THIS PLATFORM, THIS MICROPHONE. AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO USE THAT TO GIVE BACK TO THEM AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE REPRESENTED IN A WAY.
Stephen: I'M UNWARMED BY YOUR STORY. THAT'S MY DISABILITY, OKAY. ALL RIGHT? I DON'T HEAR THINGS I DON'T LIKE. SO FT. BRAGG, LARGEST MILITARY BASE IN THE WORLD IS IN YOUR DISTRICT. YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RUN TO THE RIGHT OF A REPUBLICAN ON DEFENSE.
WHY WOULD I NEED TO RUN TO THE RIGHT.
Stephen: BECAUSE THE RIGHT OWNS DEFENSE, MY FRIEND.
I THINK WHAT THE RIGHT DOESN'T OWN IS VETERAN'S AFFAIRS, THE VETERAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 11%, FOUR POINTS HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY INCREDIBLE PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE THAT AREN'T GETTING ANYWHERE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MORE INTERESTED IN SHUTTING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT, SEQUESTRATION, DOING THINGS TO MAKE SURE THE OTHER SIDE DOESN'T GET A WIN. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING NOW AND NOTHING IS GETTING DONE IN CONGRESS BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO WORK TOGETHER. THAT FRUSTRATES ME. I'M SURE IT FRUSTRATES YOU EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T WANT TO ADMIT IT IT FRUSTRATES A LOT OF FOLKS IN THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen: I WILL HAPPILY ADMIT THAT PARTISAN POLITICAL BICKERING IS HOW I MAKE MY LIVING. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S EXACTLY HOW PEOPLE IN D.C. MAKE THEIR LIVING TOO.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. NOW IT'S GOING TO BE--  (APPLAUSE) CLAY, I CAN CALL YOU CLAY.
PLEASE DO.
Stephen: IS THERE GOING TO BE ANY SINGING ON THIS TOUR OF YOURS.
PUT THE ASSES IN THE SEATS.
I'M ON SABBATICAL.
Stephen: NOT EVEN THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
I MIGHT SING IT HERE OR THERE BUT I'M GOING LEAVE IT TO YOU.
Stephen: OH SAY --
I FELL LIKE THAT WAS-- I HAVE HAD A GREAT 11 YEARS SINGING. AND THIS IS THE NEW CHAPTER FOR ME. I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN SINGING AND SO I HAVE PUT THAT ON THE BACK BURNER FOR SURE.
Stephen: HEADLINE, CLAY AIKEN REFUSES TO SING NATIONAL ANTHEM. (LAUGHTER) CLAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. CLAY AIKEN. NORTH CAROLINA'S SECOND DISTRICT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: VOTE FOR HIM IF YOU MUST. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
