Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING  US. I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR BEING SO  HAPPY TONIGHT, FOLKS, THIS IS A  HUGE NIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, OKAY. AS YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR ON THE  REPORT I HOLD A SUMMER CONCERT  SERIES CALLED COLBCHELLA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND YEAR AFTER YEAR, IT IS  ALWAYS HEADLINED BY THE HOTTEST  NAMES IN MUSIC. DR. PEPPER. T-MOBILE WIRELESS AND OF COURSE  PEPSI, THE OFFICIAL DRINK OF "WE  DON'T HAVE COKE, IS PEPSI OKAY?" WELL, FOLKS, THIS YEAR THE  ANTIESTABLISHMENT CONVENTION  DESTROYING ROCK-AND-ROLL ETHOS IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY HYUNDAI. THE SILENT "Y" STANDS FOR YOUTH  MARKETING. IN FACT, THEY'VE EVEN GIVEN ME A  SIZABLE CHECK IN EXCHANGE FOR  WHICH I PROMISE TO DELIVER THEM THE UNDISPUTED SONG OF THE  SUMMER. SO, JIMMY, JUICE IT.
HYUNDAI PRESENTS THE SONG OF  THE SUMMER OF THE CENTURY. IT AIN'T THE HEAT. IT'S THE ROCK-MIDDITY. WITH SPECIAL GUEST DAFT PUNK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS. FRENCH ELECTRO-POP MEGASTARS  DAFT PUNK, THE ARTISTS BEHIND  THE HIT "GET LUCKY" ON THE COLBERT REPORT, WAS SOMETHING  THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN WE  MADE THIS GRAPHIC. UNFORTUNATELY DAFT PUNK IS NOT  HERE. (CROWD AH-ING).
Stephen: SO, JIMMY, LET'S  CHANGE THAT GRAPHIC. OKAY. THERE YOU GO. AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, FOLKS. IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A ROUGH DAY. HERE'S THE STORY. IT'S A TRUE STORY. YOU SEE, WE BOOKED CLICK AND  CLACK OVER HERE ABOUT A MONTH  AGO BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. YOU SEE, THIS NETWORK IS OWNED  BY VIACOM WHICH IS ALSO THE  OWNER OF MTV, NICKELODEON AND THE POPULAR PUP-BE-GONE LINE OF  UTHANASIA CENTERS ALTHOUGH IE  HAVE TO SAY I'M NOT SURE OF THAT LAST ONE IS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. APPARENTLY -- AND THIS IS A  DEEPLY GUARDED SECRET SO,  SHHHHHH -- DAFT PUNK ARE GOING TO MAKE A SURPRISE APPEARANCE ON  THE MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS. SPOILER ALERT. DON'T TELL ANYBODY BECAUSE FUN  FACT, NO ONE TOLD ME UNTIL 2:00  YESTERDAY. NOW THE HEAD OF MTV, VAN  TOFFLER, IS SAYING MTV HAD BEEN  PROMISED THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO ANY TELEVISION APPEARANCE BY  DAFT PUNK LEADING UP TO THE  V.M.A.'S. DAFT PUNK SAYS NOTHING BECAUSE  THEY DON'T TALK. BUT THEIR HANDLERS SAY THEY  NEVER PROMISED MTV ANYTHING. SO HERE'S THE DEAL. HYUNDAI GAVE ME A LOT OF MONEY,  OKAY. A BIG CHECK. WHICH, FUNNY STORY, I CASHED. AND, AND IN RETURN... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND IN RETURN, I PROMISED THEM  THE SONG OF THE SUMMER WHICH IS  WHY THE HYUNDAI EXECUTIVES ARE SITTING IN MY FRONT ROW RIGHT  NOW. HI, GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AS YOU CAN TELL, THEY'RE A FUN  GROUP. SO I SAID TO MTV, LET'S REASON  HERE. THESE DAFT PUNK GUYS ARE FRENCH. THEY'RE NOT REALLY INTO  EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS. I THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE A  MENAGE-A-SHOW AND MAYBE THEY  COULD DO US BOTH. ALTHOUGH WORKING TWICE IN ONE  MONTH IS A LITTLE MORE THAN THE  FRENCH ARE USED TO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW UNFORTUNATELY... STICK WITH  ME. AGAIN ALL TRUE. UNFORTUNATELY, VAN WILDER OVER  HERE WAS NOT INTO THE IDEA. AS HE SAID IN AN EMAIL THAT WAS  FORWARDED TO ME WHICH I DON'T  REALLY HAVE THE PERMISSION TO READ ON THE APE, SO LET'S READ  IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OKAY? HE SAYS, FROM VAN TOFFLER, HEAD  OF MTV, HE SAYS, NOT SURE I CAN  HELP YOU WITH THAT ONE. CHECKD WITH MY PEEPS. AND THEY'RE FEELING FUNKY ON  THIS ONE. YOU HEARD RIGHT, FOLKS. HIS PEEPS WERE FEELING FUNKY. AND ONCE YOUR PEEPS GET ALL  FUNKED, THERE'S NO UNFUNKING  THEM. IF THAT FUNK SPREADS PAST THE  PEEP LEVEL, SOON YOUR BROS MIGHT  BE UNSTOKED AND THEN WHAT? SO...   ( APPLAUSE )   THE UPSHOT IS DAFT PUNK HAD TO  CHOOSE WHICH SHOW TO GO ON AND  THEY CHOSE NOT MINE. (AUDIENCE BOOING)
Stephen: THAT, OF COURSE, IS  A CRUSHING DISAPPOINTMENT  BROUGHT TO YOU BY HYUNDAI. NOW, HEY, LISTEN. LISTEN, I'M A PROUD MEMBER OF  THE MTV FAMILY OF NETWORKS SO I  UNDERSTAND FLAN COBBLER'S PREDICAMENT HERE. IF DAFT PUNK WERE ON MY SHOW,  PEOPLE WOULDN'T TUNE IN TO SEE  THEM ON THE M.V.A.'S ALMOST A MONTH FROM NOW. THAT'S HOW MUSIC WORKS. YOU LOVE A BAND. YOU SEE THEM ONCE. THEN NEVER WANT TO SEE THEM  AGAIN. THAT'S WHY AFTER THE BEATLES  WENT ON ED SULLIVAN, THEY  DROPPED OFF THE FACE OF THE ERR. I THINK RINGO ENDED UP WORKING  AS A TRAIN CONDUCTOR.   ( APPLAUSE )   LISTEN, I WANT TO BE CLEAR. I WANT TO BE CLEAR. AS A COMPANY MAN, THE LAST THING  I WANT TO DO WAS CAUSE ANY  TROUBLE FOR THE VIDEO MUSIC  AWARDS. AFTER ALL, THEY'RE VERY  IMPORTANT TO MTV. IT'S THE ONE NIGHT OF THE YEAR  THEY STILL SHOW MUSIC VIDEOS. SO INSTEAD... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOLKS, INSTEAD I'M GOING TO TAKE  THE HIGH ROAD AND URGE YOU TO  WATCH DAFT PUNK ON THE V.M. A.s SEPTEMBER 27 ON VH1 AT  9:00 p.m., 4:30 PACIFIC. THIS YEAR HOSTED BY CHRIS BROWN. OF COURSE BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN WILL  BE DUETTING WITH JAY-Z. PERFORMANCES BY MAROON 5, ROY  BOY, DORKSHA, BABY'S BREATH,  AMBER ALERT, ROT WE'LLER FEATURING LIL IT'LYA AND A  SPECIAL PERFORMANCE BY PAULA  DEEN AND THE E-TRADE BABY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WITH
