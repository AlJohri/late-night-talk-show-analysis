WELCOME BACK, FOLKS. FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, IF YOU CHECKED YOUR LITURGICAL CALENDAR YOU'LL KNOW THAT YESTERDAY WAS EASTER. SO I JUST WANT TO WISH EVERYBODY A HAPPY EASTER. BUT NOT FOR YESTERDAY, FOR NEXT EASTER, OKAY. LET ME GET THINGS OUT EARLY. WHILE I'M AT IT HAPPY LABOR DAY, NOW GET BACK TO WORK, IT'S APRIL. BUT SADLY RECENT PEW RESEARCH FROM THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER FOUND THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WHO SAY THE SELDOM OR NEVER ATTEND RELIGIOUS SERVICES HAS RISEN. PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO CHURCH. EVIDENTLY, SOMEBODY BLABBED ABOUT THE GOD IS EVERYWHERE LOOPHOLE. THANKFULLY, THIS YEAR SOME CHURCHES BEGAN SPENDING MONEY ON GIVEAWAYS AND PRIZES IN HOPES OF BOOSTING ATENDANCE ON EASTER SUNDAY. AT LAST, PRIZES. I MEAN WHAT ELSE WERE THEY GOING TO LURE PEOPLE IN W THE PROMISE OF UNCONDITIONAL LOVE AND ETERNAL SALVATION. THEY GAVE THAT OUT LAST YEAR. NOW FOLKS, FALLING ATTENDANCE IS WORSE AMONG MEN, CHRISTIANITY HAS BECOME UNMANLY. A LOT OF PRIESTS DON'T EVEN HAVE GIRLFRIENDS. WHICH IS WHY I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THAT SOME CHURCHES HAVE FOUND A WAY TO PUT THE DUDE BACK IN DEUTERONOMY, ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES", A SMALL BUT GROWING NUMBER OF EVANGELICAL CHURCHES HAVE EMBRACED MIXED MARTIAL ARTS TO CONVERT YOUNG MEN. THAT MAKES SENSE. IT'S LIKE JESUS SAID IF ANYONE SLAPS YOU ON THE RIGHT CHEEK, TURN TO THEM THE OTHER CHECK THEN KEEP TURNING UNTIL YOU DELIVER A ROUND HOUSE KICK TO HIS JAW. YAH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YAH! ALL THIS HARD-CORE MMA CHURCH ACTION IS IN A NEW DOCUMENTARY CALLED FIGHT CHURCH.
AS CHRISTIANS, THERE ARE TIMES WHERE YOU TAKE SHOTS. THAT'S WHERE THE BIBLE GIVES YOU YOUR TRAINING.
I DON'T LOOK LIKE THE TYPICAL PASTOR AND THAT'S OKAY WITHIN A COUPLE OF GOD FEARING MEN PUNCHING EACH OTHER IN THE FACE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS PASTOR VERSUS PASTOR.
YOU GOT TO LEARN TO PUT YOUR FOOT ON HIS NECK. SOMEBODY SHOUT JESUS.
Stephen: YES, SOMEBODY SHOUT JESUS! BUT PROBABLY NOT THE GUY WITH THE FOOT ON HIS NECK. (LAUGHTER) ALL THIS TIME ALL THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN TURNING TO JESUS FOR ANSWERS TO OUR DEEPEST QUESTIONS. BUT WE MISSED THE MOST CENTRAL QUESTION OF ALL.
CAN YOU LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME KNEE HIM IN THE FACE? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YES, YOU CAN. ESPECIALLY IF HE KEEPS RAKING HIS LEAVES INTO YOUR YARD. THIS IS THE LAST WARNING, ALLEN! AND REST ASSURED, FOLKS, ALL THIS FACE KNEEING IS BASED ON SCRIPTURE.
THERE IS A VERSE IN THE BIBLE THAT SAYS BE WARY WHEN ALL MEN SPEAK WELL OF YOU. IF EVERYBODY LOVES YOU, YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.
Stephen: AND NOTHING MAKES YOU NOT BE LOVED BY SOMEONE QUITE LIKE SHATTERING HIS CLAVICLE. WHICH MEANS YOU GOT TO BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY FIGHT CHURCH IS ABOUT SPREADING THE WORD.
THIS IS A BATTLEFIELD. WE NEED TO CHARGE HIM, NOT WAIT FOR THEM TO COME TO US.
AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ABOUT REACHING PEOPLE WITH THE GOSPEL REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO TO INTRODUCE THEM TO RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS CHRIST.
Stephen: YES, IT'S A RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS CHRIST. IT'S LIKE A BLIND DATE DURING WHICH YOU MAY BE BLINDED. (LAUGHTER) BUT I SAY WE CAN TAKE HAND TO HAND HOLY WAR EVEN FURTHER. I MEAN IF WATCHING TWO CHRISTIANS ATTACK EACH OTHER IS FUN WHAT ABOUT A CHRISTIAN AND A LION? (LAUGHTER) WITH ACTION LIKE THAT I BET YOU COULD FILL UP A STADIUM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
