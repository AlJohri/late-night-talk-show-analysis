Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A  BILLIONAIRE PHILANTHROPIST AND  FOUNDER OF MICROSOFT. I'LL ASK HIM HOW TO OPEN UP A  TCP PORT TO MY NETWORK PRINTER. PLEASE WELCOME BILL GATES! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HEY, MR. GATES.
HO YOU ARE YOU?
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. THANKS YOU FOR COMING ON. I'VE HAD YOUR WIFE ON A COUPLE  TIMES BUT NEVER YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMING.
GREAT TO BE HERE.
Stephen: ARE YOU STILL THE  RICHEST GUY IN THE WORLD? YONCH THINK SO, NO.
Stephen: COULD WE NOT GET  THE RICHEST GUY? I'M SURE STILL GOT IT ON THE  BALL BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE  RICHEST GUY? OKAY. WE'LL DO THIS ANYWAY. LAUGH YOU'RE TRUSTEE, COCHAIR OF  BILL AND MELINDA GATES  FOUNDATION, COFOUNDER OF MICROSOFT YOU HAVE THE ANNUAL  LETTER FROM BILL GATES. IT CAME OUT WHEN?
THIS MORNING.
Stephen: CAME OUT THIS  MORNING. WHAT IS -- BY THE WAY, I'M NOT  GOING TO SAY YOU ARE AN OLD OUT  OF TOUCH BILLIONAIRE BUT UM, -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAME ON MY SHOW TO SAY YOU  WROTE A LETTER. YOU KNOW ABOUT E-MAIL, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] TWEET IT IF YOU WANTED. IF THIS LETTER ARE YOU TELLING  US THINGS ARE GOTTEN BETTER OR  WORSE? IS THE HOPEFUL MESSAGE THIS  YEAR?
IT'S POSITIVE BECAUSE THE  PROGRESS ON REDUCING CHILDHOOD  DEATHS, BRINGING POPULATION GROWTH DOWN IT'S GOOD NEWS THAT  YOU WOULDN'T HEAR. SO I SHARE WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE  TO SEE IN MY TRAVELS TO AFRICA  AND ASIA.
Stephen: SOME OF THE  TBHINGS YOU ARE SHOOTING FOR ARE  POLIO, MA LAIRA, WE'VE GOT THESE THINGS ON THE ROPE?
POLIO WAS DOWN TO 250 CASES  LAST YEAR.
Stephen: IN THE WORLD?
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO IN THE NEXT SIX YEARS IT WILL  BE ZERO AND BECOME THE SECOND  DISEASE TO EVER BE ERADICATED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THE  FACT THAT YOUR SKILL SET OR THE  THING YOU MADE YOUR FORTUNE ON IS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, DO  YOU THINK INFORMATION CAN MAKE A  HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY WE HELP PEOPLE? OR IS DATA AS IMPORTANT AS  PASSION?
I THINK PASSION IS PROBABLY  THE MOST IMPORTANT. BUT BACKING GREAT SCIENTISTS WHO  HAVE GOOD IDEAS. IN THIS CASE IT'S PEOPLE  INVENTING VACCINES OR WAYS OF  GETTING ORGANIZED TO GET THEM DELIVERED OUT TO EVERYBODY. DATA IS PART OF THAT TO SEE  WHERE WE'RE DOING WELL, WHERE  WE'RE NOT DOING WELL. IF WE CAN REALLY TRACK THE MONEY  AND SEE THE RESULTS, THEN WE GET  A LOT SMARTER AS WE GO ALONG.
Stephen: HERE IS THE  PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS IS THAT  IF YOU TRACK THE DATA, SEE WHERE YOU ARE DOING WELL AND WHERE YOU  DON'T DO WELL, YOU KNOW IF YOU  ARE GETTING BETTER OR WORSE WHEREAS IF I KEEP NO RECORD OF  WHAT I DO, I CAN ALWAYS ASSUME  I'VE SUCCEED. [ LAUGHTER ]
THERE WAS SOME OF THAT IN THE  PAST. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT PEOPLE HAVE SET BAR A LITTLE  HIGHER NOW. AND, YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE SMART  ABOUT IT, AND WE CUT CHILDHOOD  DEATHS. IN 1990 IT WAS 12 MILLION A  YEAR, CHILDREN UNDER FIVE, NOW  IT'S DOWN BELOW SEVEN MILLION A  YEAR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE CUTTING THAT EVERY YEAR.
Stephen: THAT IS ALL OVER  THE WORLD.
WORLDWIDE.
Stephen: HERE IS MY SECOND  BEEF WITH YOU, WHY ARE YOU  HELPING PEOPLE IN OTHER  COUNTRIES? WHEN THERE ARE STILL THINGS TO  BE FIXED IN THE SNUTS YOU ARE AN  AMERICAN, SIR, WHAT IS WRONG WITH FIXING AMERICA BEFORE WE  FIX ANYWHERE ELSE?
WELL, OUR BIG CAUSE IN THE  UNITED STATES IS EDUCATION. WE'RE INCREDIBLY THANKFUL TO ALL  THE HELP WE HAD THAT ALLOWED US  TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
Stephen: DID YOU -- WAS  THERE A BILL GATES IN YOUR PAST? WAS THERE SOMEBODY LIKE BILL  GATES IN YOUR SNANCHT NO, BUT  THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT WHERE I GOT A GREAT EDUCATION. MY WIFE DID. WARREN BUFFETT WHO PROVIDES HALF  OF RESPHORTSZ FOUNDATION, HE IS  SUPER THANKFUL HE GREW UP HERE. WE WANTED TO PICK THE MOST  IMPORTANT THING FOR THE COUNTRY,  WHETHER IT'S EQUITY OR SUCCESS FOR THE COUNTRY I THINK SAID  CASE IS THE RIGHT CHOICE.
Stephen: WHEN YOU GO AROUND  THE WORLD DO YOU WEAR AN  AMERICAN FLAG SO PEOPLE KNOW IT'S AMERICAN MONEY, A TEN  GALLON HAT, SOMETHING LIKE THAT? DO THEY KNOW YOU'RE AMERICAN?
OH, YEAH. THEY HOPE AMERICAN INNOVATION  AND GENEROSITY CONTINUES TO LEAD  THE WORLD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: YOU CAN APPLAUD  AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU ARE NOT DAY-TO-DAY AT  MICROSOFT ANYMORE. YOU ARE STILL CHARM BUT NOT  DAY-TO-DAY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: DO YOU MISS THE  ROUGH AND TUMBLE. DO YOU SAY I'M GOING TO DRINK  COFFEE ALL NIGHT AND CODE.
I DON'T STAY UP ALL NIGHT  QUITE AS MUCH. IT'S PARTLY MY AGE. IT DOESN'T GRAB ME QUITE THE  SAME WAY. YES, I MISS THE INTENSITY. IT WAS PHENOMENALLY FUN. FOR MY 20s, 30s AND 40s IT  WAS THE COOLEST THING I COULD  HAVE DONE.
Stephen: YOU DON'T LOOK A  DAY OVER 40, SIR. I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE  I'M GOING TO HIT YOU UP FOR CASH  LATER. [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE OUT THERE ALL THINK, YOU  KNOW, I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO TALK  TO STEVE JOBS A FEW TIMES AND IT WAS -- I WASN'T A FRIEND OF HIS  BUT WE SPOKE. AND EVERYBODY -- PEOPLE SAY WHAT  A COOL GUY STEVE JOBS WAS. AND YOU ARE OUT THERE SAVING THE  WORLD AND YET, YOU DON'T HAVE  THE COOL FACTOR. NO OFFENSE IT'S NOT THE SAME  COOL FACTOR LIKE TURTLENECK COOL  FACTOR, A MAN WHO CONTRIBUTED A GREAT DEAL. DOES IT BUG YOU YOU ARE SAVING  THE WORLD AND HE'S THE MEMORIES  OF A COOL GUY? DID YOU EVER WANT TO BE THE COOL  GUY?
HE WAS ALWAYS COOLER THAN ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: YEAH?
YEAH.
Stephen: MAYBE SAVING THE  WORLD WILL GET COOL?
IT'S OKAY.
Stephen: REALLY, YOU DON'T  CARE?
NO, I MEAN, HE WAS BRILLIANT. HE HAD HIS OWN STYLE HIS OWN  APPROACH. MINE IS -- I GUESS A LITTLE  GEEKIER THAN HIS WAS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELL HERE IS TO  THE GEEKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME. BILL GATES.
