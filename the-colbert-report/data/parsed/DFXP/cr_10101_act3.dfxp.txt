WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT SAY RENOWNED JOURNALIST WHO HAS A NEW COLLECTION OF NEW YORKER PIECES FROM THE 1940s. PREVIOUSLY ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE WAITING ROOM OF A 90-YEAR-OLD DENTIST. PLEASE WELCOME DAVID REMNICK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. I HAVE TO GET RID OF THESE NEW YORKERS, THEY STACK UP AFTER A WHILE. THANKS FOR COMING ON, WE HAVE MET BEFORE, I HAVE NEVER HAD YOU DOWN FOR AN INTERVIEW. NICE TO FINALLY HAVE YOU HERE.
GREAT TO BE HERE.
Stephen: EDITOR OF "THE NEW YORKER" SINCE 1998 ALSO A PULITZER PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR OF LENINS TOMB, HAVE WRITTEN OVER A HUNDRED ARTICLES FOR YOUR OWN MAGAZINE, YOU MUST KNOW SOMEBODY. AND YOU'RE THE AUTHOR-- NOT THE AUTHOR, YOU'RE HERE WITH A NEW BOOK CALLED THE 40s. THE STORY OF A DECADE. AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE BEST ARTICLES FROM THE 1940S.
IT WAS A TIME WHEN "THE NEW YORKER" GREW UP WITH THE COUNTRY, THE MAGAZINE WAS A KIND OF COMIC LIGHT MAGAZINE OF THE JAZZ AGE AND SUDDENLY WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE WAR, THE MAGAZINE REALLY GREW UP. IT WAS KIND THE BIRTH OF A LITERARY JOURNALISM BOTH AT WAR AND AT HOME AFTERWARDS AS THE NATION BECAME THIS KIND OF SINGULAR POWER DURING THE START OF THE AMERICAN CENTURY.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE MOST OBVIOUS CHANGE TO THE MAGAZINE? WERE ALL THE DOG PSYCHIATRISTS OVERSEAS FIGHTING HITLER.
YEAH, THEY WERE ON EYE DESERT ISLAND, IN THE SAME CARTOON. I THINK IT WAS AN AMAZING THING, THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD SEND A JOURNALIST TO JAPAN, A JOURNALIST AND MAYBE EVERYBODY HERE HAS READ THIS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
Stephen: IN 1946.
THAT'S RIGHT. AND THAT WAS CONSIDERED IN SOME WAYS AN INCREDIBLY BOLD THING TO DO. BUT EVEN SUBVERSIVE TO REPORT ON THE FALLEN ENEMY IN BASICALLY SYMPATHETIC TERMS AND SEE WHAT THE EFFECT OF AN ATOMIC BOMB HAD BEEN ON THIS ISLAND.
Stephen: SO "THE NEW YORKER" SENT SOMEBODY TO  HIROSHIMA IN '46 TO REPORT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PEOPLE THAT GOT BOMBED.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: THAT WASN'T SEEN AS TREASONIST.
THIS ARTICLE WHICH TOOK UP THE ENTIRE ISSUE OF "THE NEW YORKER", NO CARTOONS, JUST FROM BEGINNING TO END WAS SUCH A SENSATION THAT IT WAS READ OVER THE RADIO, ARMED THE WORLD AND TRANSLATED INTO MANY, MANY LANGUAGES AND IT BECAME, YOU KNOW, A STAPLE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS EVERYWHERE.
Stephen: I NEVER READ THE ARTICLE. GIVE ME A PREVIEW, DID THE JAPANESE LIKE IT?
THEY DID NOT SO MUCH.
Stephen: THE UNITED STATES DID IT SO IT HAD TO BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
THAT HAS A CERTAIN LOGIC.
Stephen: WHY WAS THERE ANYONE LEFT TO WORK ON "THE NEW YORKER"? WHY WASN'T EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE 1940s OFF FIGHTING.
GOOD POINT. FOR THE FIRST TIME "THE NEW YORKER" REALLY HAD MANY MORE WOMEN ON ITS STAFF BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY STAFF WRITERS AND EDITORS WHO HAD GONE OFF IN UNIFORM TO EUROPE AND TO ASIA.
AS "THE NEW YORKER" CHANGED FROM A COMEDY MAGAZINE IN THE 1920s AND 1930s INTO WHAT IT BECAME WHICH WAS SORT OF A-- REALLY JOURNALISM IN THE 1940s, WERE THERE PEOPLE THAT Y'ALL REJECTED THAT LATER YOU SAID BOY, WE WERE DUMB.
YEAH, I MEAN NO MAGAZINE CAN GET EVERYBODY. SO A POET LIKE ELIZABETH BISHOP FLOURISHED IN "THE NEW YORKER". AND WE MISSED THE BOAT ON SOMEBODY LIKE WALLACE STEVENS AND IT IS INEVITABLE THAT A MAGAZINE IS GOING TO DO THIS. AND IT'S GOING TO SET THE TONE OF THE MAGAZINE, NOT ONLY WHO YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT, AND SOMETIMES WHO YOU ARE WRONG ABOUT.
Stephen: NOW YOU, AS I SAID YOU WON A PULITZER PRIZE FOR YOUR BOOK LENIN'S TOMB. YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE RUSSIANS AND THE RUSSIAN MIND.
YEAH. THINGS ARE GOING GREAT.
Stephen: OKAY. I-- I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE UKRAINE. ALL RIGHT. WHY AM I WORRIED?
AND HOW MUCH LONGER AM I GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I'M JUST WAITING THROUGH AN OMELET OF CONSONANTS WITH EVERY WORD IT WAS BAD ENOUGH TO MEMORIZE THE ABU, BIN LADEN OR WHATEVER. AT LEAST THAT IS LANGUAGE HAS SOME [BLEEP] VOWELS IN IT.
Stephen: IT'S A CONSONANT HEAVY DIET OVER THERE. LET'S BIND THEM UP A BIT, THEY SHOULD GET A CELL PHONE. THAT IS THE CENTER OF THE CONTROVERSY, IT A DISASTER. THERE MIGHT BE A CIVIL WAR IN UKRAINE IF WE DON'T WATCH OUT. THERE MIGHT BE A-- .
Stephen: IS IT REALLY A CIVIL WAR OR A WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE.
A CIVIL WAR IN MY VIEW THAT IS BEING PROVOKED BY RUSSIA. THERE IS BLAME TO GO ALL AROUND. EVERYBODY HAS MISHANDLED THIS BUT AT THE CENTER OF THIS, THE REAL CULPRIT OF WHY WE ARE IN THIS TERRIBLY DANGEROUS SPOT IS VLADIMIR PUTIN. VLADIMIR PUTIN.
Stephen: HE IS A STRONG LEADER. YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THAT.
YES, HE SHOWS HIS MUSCLE.
Stephen: YES, HE DOES.
HE DOES SHOW HIS MUSCLE.
Stephen: HE TAKES HIS SHIRT OFF. HE HAS BEEN TAKING HIS SHIRT OFF FOR A LONG TIME. WHEN WILL WE KNOW THINGS ARE GETTING REALLY DANGEROUS, WHEN HE TAKES HIS PANTS OFF?
YOU KNOW, FOR MANY REASONS I'M PRAYING HE KEEPS HIS PANTS ON. I THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE WORLD.
Stephen: DO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE LIKE THIS?
UNFORTUNATELY, YES, HIS APPROVAL RATING IS IN THE 80s.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK HE DID THIS FOR APPROVAL RATINGS?
YES.
Stephen: BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE JUST GONE ON "BETWEEN TWO FERNS" AND TAKEN CARE OF IT THAT WAY.
YES, YEAH. THAT WOULD HAVE WORKED.
Stephen: DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DAVID REMNICK, "THE NEW YORKER". THE 40s. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
