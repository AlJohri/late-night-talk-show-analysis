LET'S SEE, I BATHED IN ARCTIC MOUNTAIN WATER.
I'M WALTER HITTY.
CHERYL, MILLHOFF.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN.
TESTING THE LIMITS OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE.
PERHAPS I CAN CONTACT YOU, POSSIBLY THROUGH MY-- POETRY FALCON.
POETRY FALCON, I LIKE THAT (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YEAH, THOSE GUYS A MOUNTAIN CLIMBER.
NO, NO HE IS MANAGING THAT, WALTER HAS, YOU KNOW, HE IS A DAY DREAMER SOW LIVES IN HIS HEAD. HE HAS THIS INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL INSIDE OF HIM TO BE ALL OF THESE THINGS BUT IN REAL LIFE HE CAN'T REALIZE THAT. IT IS ALL ABOUT THE POTENTIAL THAT WE HAVE INSIDE OF US AND WHO WE CAN BE AND BEING THE BEST POSSIBLE VERSION OF OURSELVE IT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS UNIVERSALLY RELATABLE, THAT BEING.
Stephen: I DIDN'T GET IT.
WELL, HE KEEPS ON, HE IS A SCULPTURE, A MOUNTAIN CLIMBER AT ONE POINT AND ONE POINT HE IS A LITTLE OLD MAN, ANOTHER ONE --
EXACTLY.
Stephen: A WHICH OF THOSE IS THE REAL WALTER HITTY.
WELL, THEY'RE ALL ASPECTS OF HIS PERSONALITY. THEY'RE ALL PART OF WHO HE IS. IT IS THE SAME WAY YOU OR I HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS TO WHO WE ARE. I'M SURE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS INSIDE.
Stephen: SOMETIMES I WEAR A TIE, SOMETIMES I DON'T.
YES, RIGHT SO, IF YOU WERE IN WALTER HITTY ONE OF YOUR CHARACTERS YOU WOULD BE WEARING A TIE AND THE OTHER ONE YOU WOULDN'T.
Stephen: RIGHT.
YEAH.
Stephen: DON'T ACTORS JUST IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE SOMEONE ELSE, ARE YOU WALTER HITTY?
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE SAYING TO ME, WHAT?
Stephen: ARE YOU WALTER HITTY, IS BEN STILLER WALTER HITTY.
YEAH, SURE THERE ARE PARTS OF ME I CAN RELATE TO IN THE CHARACTER.
Stephen: DON'T YELL AT ME, DON'T YELL AT ME, I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION.
SORRY, SORRY.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS --
I'M-- I DIDN'T GET YOUR YOUR FILM, I DIDN'T GET-- CARDS ON THE TABLE, I'M NOT ONE OF THESE HOLLYWOOD ELITISTS WHO UNDERSTAND FILMS LIKE SOMETHING ABOUT MARY OR TROPIC THUNDER OR THIS ONE.
I GET IT.
Stephen: I DON'T GET ART FILM.
YOU DON'T GO FOR THE HIGH FALL OUTIN.
Stephen: I DON'T GO FOR THAT. -- DOES THINGS THAT ARE REAL.
HE ENGAGES IN REAL LIFE.
Stephen: HE ACTUALLY DOES THINGS LATER.
HE DOES REAL THINGS, THINGS THAT HE IMAGINED DOING AND HE HAS TO STEP INTO REALITY, AND KIND OF SEIZE THE MOMENT AND GO AND LIVE HIS LIFE FOR REAL.
Stephen: WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS BETTER.
WELL, REAL LIFE, I THINK, YOU KNOW, IS A GOOD THING. AND HAVING AN IMAGINATION IS A GOOD THING ALSO. I THINK BOTH ARE ASPECTS, YOUR IMAGINATION, YOUR DAY DREAMS CAN FUEL YOUR REAL LIFE AND GET TO YOU DO THINGS THAT YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY DO, IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT IMAGINATION.
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY. SO IMAGINATION IS GOOD. AND REAL LIFE IS GOOD.
YESING EXACTLY. BOTH ARE OKAY.
Stephen: DO HE MAKES NO JOURNEY-- HE'S MANAGING THINGS AN IT'S GOOD AND LATER IT DOES REAL THINGS THAT ARE GOOD SO HE DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER OR WORSE THROUGHOUT THE FILM.
DID YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE MOVIE.
Stephen: I DID SEE ITS MOVIE, I DIDN'TEE IT SHALL DID -- I SAW IT OUT OF ORDER.
OKAY.
Stephen: I SAW IT BENJAMIN BUTTON STYLE.
RIGHT, RIGHT, EXACTLY.
Stephen: THAT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SKEERNTION SPOILER ALERT, I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL ANYTHING THAT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS IN THE MOVIES.
NO, NO IT'S ALL ABOUT BECOMING WHO, YOU KNOW, THE BEST POSSIBLE VERSION OF YOURSELF, I GUESS OR BEING WHO YOU WANT TO BE.
Stephen: IS THIS THE BEST POSSIBLE VERSION OF YOU, BEN STILLER.
UNFORTUNATELY, AT THIS MOMENT, YES.
Stephen: AS GOOD AS IT GETS.
YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. THIS THING OPENS ON CHRISTMAS DAY.
YES T IS.
Stephen: THAT IS BALANCESY, MY MAN. THAT'S BALANCESY, YOU ARE SAYING TO A CHRISTIAN NATION, DON'T BE WITH YOUR FAMILY ON CHRISTMAS DAY, COME SEE MY MOVIE.

Stephen: TO HELL WITH JESUS.
I WANTED FIRST NIGHT OF HANUKKAH AS THE OPENING AND IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
