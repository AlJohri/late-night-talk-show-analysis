Stephen: BOOM! THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT BEGUN  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] WHAT  ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THESE  PEOPLE? GOOD FOR YOU. SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS -- FOLKS --  WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. PLEASE, WE'VE GOT TO GET TO IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I UNDERSTAND THE EXCITEMENT  BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW  FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST IS DUSTIN HOFFMAN,  DIRECTOR OF THE NEW MOVIE  "QUINTET" ABOUT 4 RETIRED OPERA STARS, AND IN HIS FILM DEBUT  THEIR FRIEND BUDDY, WHO  ACCOMPANIES THEM ON THE SPOONS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT FIRST, I'M STILL REELING  FROM YESTERDAY'S INAUGURATION  DISASTER. [ LAUGHTER ] FIRST OFF, WHERE WAS SECURITY? THE SECRET SERVICE IS SUPPOSED  TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT AND  FIRST LADY, BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A KISS, THEY WERE VICIOUSLY  PHOTOBOMBED. [ LAUGHTER ] ENJOY -- [ LAUGHTER ] ENJOY GITMO, MALIA. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE MORE I THINK ABOUT, THE  LESS IMPRESSED I AM WITH OBAMA'S  SPEECH. AND IT'S NOT JUST ME. IT'S EVERYONE ON FOX NEWS. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE PRESIDENT MADE THE CASE  FOR BIG GOVERNMENT.
THIS SPEECH TODAY WAS AN ODE  TO BIG GOVERNMENT. IT WAS A HYMN TO BIG GOVERNMENT. AT HIS HEART, I THINK PRESIDENT  OBAMA IS A SOCIALIST.
Stephen: YES, AT HIS HEART HE  IS A SOCIALIST. EVER NOTICE HOW IT SHARES THE  BLOOD WITH ALL THE OTHER ORGANS? [ LAUGHTER ] WELL SORRY, OBAMA, YOUR CLASS  WARFARE ISN'T GOING TO WORK. FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SHAMWOW  PITCHMAN STUART VARNEY KNOWS THE  REASON WHY. [ LAUGHTER ]
RICH PEOPLE, POWERFUL PEOPLE,  IN AMERICA TODAY, ARE REVILED. THEY'RE DISMISSED AS FAT CATS  WHO DON'T PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. WE JUST HATE 'EM-- RICH PEOPLE  ARE EVIL. YET, ALONG COMES THIS SHOW  "DOWNTON ABBEY"-- RICH PEOPLE  PROMINENTLY FEATURED AND THEY'RE GENEROUS; THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE;  THEY CREATE JOBS, FOR HEAVEN'S  SAKE; THEY'RE CLASSY; THEY'VE GOT STYLE AND WE LOVE 'EM. THAT SHOW IS WILDLY POPULAR,  WHICH POSES A THREAT TO THE  LEFT, DOESN'T IT?
Stephen: YES, IT DOES.
Stephen: YES, THE POPULARITY  OF "DOWNTON ABBEY" PROVES THAT  AMERICA LOVES RICH GUYS. THE SAME WAY THE POPULARITY OF  "BREAKING BAD" PROVES AMERICA  LOVES METH DEALERS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOD, IT WOULD BE SO GREAT TO  WORK FOR A RICH ARISTOCRAT, LIKE  THE FICTIONAL LORD GRANTHAM. JUST ASK THE FICTIONAL NEWSMAN  STEVE DOOCY.
HERE'S THE THING-- THE ENTIRE  TOWN LOVES THE RICH GUY WHO  LIVES IN THE ABBEY BECAUSE HE PROVIDES THE JOBS. HE LOOKS AFTER EVERYBODY. HE PROVIDES FREE MEDICAL CARE  FOR EVERYBODY. WITHOUT HIM-- AND SPOILER ALERT,  IT LOOKED LIKE TWO WEEKS AGO, HE  WAS GOING TO LOSE THE JOINT-- WITHOUT HIM THE PLACE WOULD GO  BELLY UP.
Stephen: YES, HE LOOKS  AFTER EVERYBODY. YES, EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON LORD  GRANTHAM. HE PAYS FOR THE MEDICAL CLINIC  IN TOWN AND TWO WEEKS AGO, HE  ALMOST LOST EVERYTHING BECAUSE HE INVESTED POORLY IN THE  CANADIAN RAILROAD. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S HOW OUR  SOCIETY SHOULD FUNCTION. ONE RICH GUY FAILS, NOBODY GETS  HEALTHCARE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE POINT IS HIS SPEECH WAS A  SWING AND A MISS NOT JUST FOR  WHAT HE DID SAY BUT FOR WHAT HE DID NOT SAY.
IT WAS A VERY BIZARRE,  DISORDERED PRIORITY OF WHAT OUR  NATIONAL INTERESTS WERE. WHERE WAS THE DEBT? WHERE WAS THE DEFICIT? WHERE WAS THE UNEMPLOYMENT? WHERE WAS THE ISSUE POVERTY IN  AMERICA, WHICH HAS INCREASED  UNDER HIS WATCH? WHERE'S THE HOPELESSNESS?
Stephen: YEAH, WHERE WAS THE  HOPELESSNESS? [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC  WANTS! [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, WHO COULD FORGET FDR'S  FAMOUS INAUGRUAL WHEN HE  PROCLAIMED:  "THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF, AND ALSO A  SECOND DEPRESSION, RAMPANT  STARVATION, AND MY GUT'S TELLING ME EUROPE'S A TINDERBOX. AH, WHAT'S THE POINT? WE'RE ALL DOOMED! I CAN'T WALK! I CAN'T WALK!" [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ANYWAY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO  DO? WE'RE LOOKING AT FOUR MORE YEARS  OF THIS GUY, AND THANKS TO  OBAMACARE, WE MIGHT LIVE TO SEE  IT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHERE DID WE GO WRONG? THE REPUBLICANS HAD EVERYTHING  GOING FOR THEM: A TERRIBLE  ECONOMY, AN UNPOPULAR INCUMBENT, AND A POSITIVE MESSAGE FOR THE  AMERICAN VOTER:  LESS THAN HALF  OF YOU ARE PARASITES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND STILL -- STILL WE LOST. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WITH AMERICA'S CHANGING  DEMOGRAPHICS, IT ONLY LOOKS  BLEAKER FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE FUTURE, UNLESS SCIENCE CAN FIND  A WAY FOR LATINO WOMEN TO GIVE  BIRTH TO OLD WHITE MEN. [ LAUGHTER ] WHERE IS THE FUNDING, KOCH  BROTHERS?! GET ON IT! 'CAUSE IT'S BAD. IT'S BAD, FOLKS. IN 2012 THE GOP LOST THE  PRESIDENCY, LOST THE SENATE, AND  LOST THE VOTE COUNT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BY A COMBINED  1.1 MILLION VOTES. REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T GOTTEN AN  ASS-PADDLING LIKE THAT SINCE DC  SHUT DOWN MADAME KINK'S RUMP  DUNGEON. [ LAUGHTER ] IF IT'S WEDNESDAY,  ASK FOR THE TRICKLE-DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S GETTING SO BAD, THAT TO  WIN THE PRESIDENCY NEXT TIME,  REPUBLICANS MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR MESSAGING OR THEIR  POLICIES OR THE CONSTITUENCIES  THEY SERVE. THANKFULLY, THERE'S A BETTER  ANSWER AND THAT BRINGS US TO  TONIGHT'S WORD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WIN, LOSE, OR REDRAW. NOW, CONSERVATIVES, DON'T WELD  YOUR BUNKER DOOR SHUT JUST YET. BECAUSE AS BAD AS THINGS LOOK,  THERE IS ONE PLACE REPUBLICANS  DID HOLD ON TO POWER.
REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO HOLD  A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE.
Stephen: YES, EVEN THOUGH  THEY LOST THE COMBINED VOTE,  THE GOP KEPT CONTROL OF THE HOUSE BY A 33-SEAT MARGIN. AND THEY DID IT WITHOUT WATERING  DOWN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  PLATFORM. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DID THE REPUBLICAN DOZEN IT? -- DID THE REPUBLICANS DO IT? WITH A LITTLE THING CALLED  "GERRYMANDERING." [ LAUGHTER ] SEE, IN 2010, REPUBLICAN STATE  LEGISLATURES ACROSS THE NATION  REDREW CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS TO MAKE THEM A LOCK FOR THE  GOP-- AND IN SOME CASES, JUST TO  SEND DEMOCRATS A MESSAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF  GERRYMANDERING: INSTEAD OF  VOTERS GETTING TO PICK THEIR LEADERS, LEADERS GET TO PICK  THEIR VOTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I SAY WHY NOT? WE SHOULD TRUST OUR LEADERS. AFTER ALL, WE VOTED FOR THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, NOW THAT THE GOP HAS ITS  GERRYMANDER GAME DOWN, THEY'RE  READY TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT  LEVEL. REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS IN THE  KEY SWING STATES OF MICHIGAN,  WISCONSIN, PENNSYLVANIA AND VIRGINIA ARE LINING UP BEHIND. "PROPOSALS THAT WOULD ALLOCATE  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORAL COLLEGE  VOTES BY CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT."  AS A SUPPORTER OF THIS IDEA,  PENNSYLVANIA STATE SENATOR  DOMINIC PILEGGI ARGUES, THE CURRENT "WINNER-TAKE-ALL SYSTEM  IS INHERENTLY UNFAIR BECAUSE THE  LOSING PARTY GETS NO CREDIT IN THE ELECTORAL COUNT." [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, THE LOSING PARTY NEVER  GETS TO PICK THE PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS LEGISLATION JUST ALLOWS  REPUBLICANS TO LEVEL THE PLAYING  FIELD. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE IS THE GREAT PART:  'CUZ IF YOU APPLIED THIS PLAN TO  THE 2012 ELECTION, EVEN THOUGH FIVE MILLION MORE PEOPLE VOTED  FOR DEMOCRAT, THE REPUBLICAN  WOULD HAVE WON THE PRESIDENCY BY 22 ELECTORAL VOTES. IT'S WIN, WIN! [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A CINDERELLA STORY! IT'S LIKE ROCKY! [ LAUGHTER ] I WILL ADMIT FREELY THAT IT'S  NOT EXACTLY  MAJORITY RULE, BUT AS MUCH AS I  LOVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SOMETIMES THE MAJORITY JUST  DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I SAY -- [ LAUGHTER ] SO DO IT, REPUBLICANS, OVER THE  NEXT FOUR YEARS, OUR SOCIETY'S  VALUES WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE ALONG WITH ITS DEMOGRAPHICS, SO  YOU MUST LISTEN TO THESE VOTERS  AND THEN MAKE SURE THEY CANNOT
