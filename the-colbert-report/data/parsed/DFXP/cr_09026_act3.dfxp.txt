THE LONGER THE WORD THE  SMARTER YOU MUST BE.
POSSIBLY, POSSIBLY.
Stephen:  YOU'RE ALSO A. ARER AT THE NATURAL HISTORY  MUSEUM IN LONDON, A FELLOW OF  THE ROYAL SOCIETY, AND YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "LONE  SURVIVORS-- HOW WE CAME TO BE  THE ONLY HUMANS ON EARTH." GOTTA SAY, NOT A GREAT PHOTO OF  YOU ON THE COVER THERE.   (  LAUGHTER  ).
YES, YES.
Stephen:  GAINED A FEW  POUNDS. LONE SURVIVORS, THE ONLY HUMANS  ON EARTH-- HUMANS ARE THE ONLY  HUMANS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS?
WELL, IF YOU GO BACK 100,000  YEARS --
Stephen:  I RARELY DO, I  RARELY DO.
I TEND TO STOP ABOUT 6,000  YEARS AGO WHEN EVERYTHING WAS  CREATED, BUT GO AHEAD.
WE'LL GO BACK EVEN FURTHER.
Stephen:  OKAY. AND THEN THERE WERE PROBABLY AT  LEAST FIVE KINDS OF HUMANS ON  THE EARTH 100,000 YEARS AGO. THERE WERE NEANDERTHALS IN  EUROPE. THERE WERE PEOPLE IN ASIA CALLED  THE DEMISSIVIANS, THERE WERE  PEOPLE IN JAFFA AND A WEIRD THING NICKNAMED HOBBIT LIVING ON  THE ISLANDFUL FLORESC. THE OTHER SPECIES DIED OUT. WE ARE THE ONLY SURVIVORS. AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS WHY  ARE WE THE ONLY ONE LEFT.
Stephen:  WHICH WERE WE?
WE WERE THE ONES EVOLVING IN  AFRICA, HOMO SAPIENS. AND ABOUT 60,000 YEARS AGO, WE  STARTED TO COME OUT OF AFRICA  --
Stephen:  WAIT, WAIT, WHERE  DID THE NEANDER THALZ COME FROM  IF THEY WEREN'T FROM AFRICA?
WE GO BACK NOW ABOUT 500,000  YEARS, HALF A MILLION YEARS. WE HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR WITH  THE NEANDERTHALS AND WE SPLIT  FROM THEM AND WENT IN OUR OWN  DIRECTION.
Stephen:  WAS THAT IN  AFRICA WE SPLIT OFF?
PROBABLY THERE WAS A SPECIES  CALLED HOMOHYDER BERG, THAT  SPECIES LIVED IN EUROPE, A EXPWRARK AFRICA AND STARTED TO  EVOLVE INTO NEW SPECIES. NORTH OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND  EUROPE AND ASIA IT BECAME THE  NEANDERTHALS AND SOUTH OF THE MEDITERRANEAN IN AFRICA IT  BECAME US. WE CAM OUT AND THE BIG QUESTION  IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE CAME  OUT --
Stephen:  WE KICKED A  LITTLE ASS, DIDN'T WE, KICKED A  LITTLE ASS, NEANDERTHAL ASS.
ONE VIEW IS WE WIPED THE  OTHER SPECIES OUT. BUT IT LOOKS MORE COMPLICATED  THAN THAT, AND IT WASN'T A  COMPLETE WIPEOUT AS WE'VE LEARNED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF  YEARS.
Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU  MEAN?
THERE WAS A BIT OF  INTERBREEDING.
Stephen:  OH, COME ON, COME  ON.
YOU AND I HAVE GOT A LITTLE  BIT OF NEANDERTHAL IN US?
Stephen:  REALLY? HOW MUCH? WHAT PART OF ME IS NEANDERTHAL? IS IT THE GUY THAT COMES OUT  WHEN I'M DRUNK. HE'S ROUGH TRADE.
PROBABLY-- IT'S IN YOUR  D.N.A., BUT IT MAY NOT BE  SHOWING PHYSICALLY.
Stephen:  IS IT DOING  ANYTHING IN THERE, OR IS IT LIKE  A SLEEPER CELL, LIKE A TERRORIST D.N.A. SLEEPER CELL?
IT'S NOT DOING TOO MUCH.
Stephen:  WE INTERBRED WITH  THE NEANDERTHALS. WE KNOW THIS?
WE DID. BASICALLY WE GET OUR D.N.A. FROM  THE NEANDERTHAL FOSSILS NOW AND  WE RECREATED MOST OF THEIR  GENOME. COMPARING THAT WITH HUMANS WE  FIND PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF AFRICA--  PEOPLE IN EUROPE, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, NATIVE AMERICANS--  THEY'VE ALL GOT A BIT OF  NEANDERTHAL D.N.A. IN THEM. KIND OF FOR THE NEANDERTHALS  IT'S A CHANGE OF RELATIONSHIP. I USED TO THINK THEY COMPLETELY  DIED OUT. NOW WE KNOW THEY DIDN'T DIE  OUT. SOME OF THEIR D.N.A. LIVES ON IN  US.
Stephen:  CAN WE GET A  NEANDERTHAL BACK BY SELECTIVE  BREEDING? THAT WOULD PROBABLY --
Stephen:  IT'S A QUESTION,  SCIENCE I'M ASK AG AT  QUESTION.
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. OBVIOUSLY, THE DEBATE A COUPLE  OF WEEKS AGO ABOUT CLOPG A  NEANDERTHAL, AND IT'S THE SORT OF THING WE WOULD HAVE SAID WAS  IMPOSSIBLE A FEW YEARS AGO. NOW, AT LEAST SOME IDIOT WITH  ENOUGH MONEY AND ARROGANCE COULD  ONE DAY PROBABLY DO IT.   (  LAUGHTER  )     ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  YOU'RE SINGING MY  SONG. ARE WE STILL EVOLVING?
WE ARE STILL EVOLVING.
Stephen:  WHAT'S NEXT FOR  US?
I THINK WE CAN SAY WHAT ISN'T  GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU SEE THESE DIAGRAMS AND  PICTURES SOMETIMES OF STICK  PEOPLE WITH GREAT BIG BRAINS.
Stephen:  EXACTLY.
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. OUR BRAINS HAVE ACTUALLY GOTTEN  SMALLER IN THE LAST 20,000  YEARS, SOME MAYBE MORE THAN  OTHERS. I DON'T KNOW.   (  LAUGHTER  )   BUT OVERALL, WE HAVE-- YEAH. WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD SHRINKING  BRAINS IN THE LAST 20,000  YEARS.
Stephen:  HOW ABOUT OUR  GUT?
THERE'S A THING CALLED THE  EXPENSESSIVE TISSUE HYPOTHESIS. IT SAYS WE ESOLVED OUR LARGE  BRAINS BY CHANGE OUR DIET. OUR ANCESTORS HAD GREAT BIG GUTS  BECAUSE THEY WERE VEGETARIAN. THEY NEVER HAD ENOUGH SPARE  ENERGY BECAUSE THEIR GUTS WERE  USING 20% OF THEIR ENERGY. THEY NEVER HAD ENOUGH SPARE  ENERGY TO EVOLVE A LARGE BRAIN. WHEN WE STARTED EATING MEAT, IT  FREED UP ENERGY AND WE COULD  START TO RUN A BIGGER BRAIN.
Stephen:  THAT'S WHY  VEGETARIANISM SEEMS SO STUPID TO  ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME.   ( APPLAUSE )   THE BOOK IS "LONE SURVIVORS."  CHRIS STRINGER, WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK.
