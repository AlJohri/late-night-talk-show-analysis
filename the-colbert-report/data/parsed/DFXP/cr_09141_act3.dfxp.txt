WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. PIE GUEST TONIGHT, PLEASE  WELCOME RICHARD BRODHEAD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NICE TO MEET YOU.
ALL RIGHT, SIR. PROFESSOR RICHARD BRODHEAD.
THAT WOULD BE ME.
ALL RIGHT, DUKE  UNIVERSITY, PRESIDENT OF  DUKE, CO-CHAIR OF THE  COMMISSION ON THE HUMANNITIES AND SOCIAL  SCIENCES, CREATED BY THE  AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND  SCIENCE. AND YOU HAVE A NEW REPORT  CALLED THE HEART OF THE  MATTER. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS THE  AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND  SCIENCES?
IT'S --
IS THAT A TAXPAYER  BOONDOGGLE?
YOU WILL BE SORRY TO HEAR  THAT IT ISN'T.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
IT'S A SCHOLARLY SOCIETY  THAT REPRESENTS PEOPLE  ACROSS ALL THE FIELDS OF  LEARNING.
Stephen: WAS'S YOUR FIELD  OF LEARNING BEFORE WE GET IN  THIS.
MY DEGREE IS IN ENGLISH.
Stephen: ENGLISH MAJOR,  YOU WENT FOR THE--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. YOU WENT FOR THE BIG CASH.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
NOW I'M ON YOUR SHOW.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, YEAH. IT WORKED OUT.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: LET'S GIVE THE  HUMANNITIES THE COLBERT  BUMP. ALL RIGHT, YOU LAMENT. WE CAN DO IT, WE CAN DO IT  IF YOU WANT. THERE YOU GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU LAMENT IN THIS REPORT  THE FALL OF THE HUMANNITIES  IN OUR UNIVERSITIES. PEOPLE ARE NOT BECOMING  HUMANNITIES MAJORS ANY MORE. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
WELL, YOU OVERSTATED. IT'S NOT SOME OF THE DECLINE  AS WE THINK THAT ALL ACROSS  AMERICAN LIFE STARTING IN KINDERGARTEN THROUGH 12th  GRADE THROUGH COLLEGE AND  THROUGH LATER LIFE THERE'S A HUNGER FOR THE THINGS THE  HUMANNITIES SUPPLY. AND PEOPLE HAVEN'T PAID IT  AS MUCH ATTENTION.
Stephen: OF COURSE WE ARE  HUMANS, OF COURSE WE HUNGER  FOR THE HUMANNITIES.
WELL, THEN WHAT IS THE  HUMANNITIES.
I DON'T KNOW, ACTUALLY.
WELL, I WILL TELL YOU.
Stephen: NOT A  HUMANNITIES MAJOR, I DON'T  KNOW.
THE HUMANNITIES IS HUMANS  STUDYING THE THINGS OTHER  HUMANS HAVE ACHIEVED AND SUFFERED AND STRUGGLED FOR  IN OTHER TIMES AND PLACES.
Stephen: BUT DOES THAT  HOW OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS  BECOME, WE HAVE TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN HOW TO BE HUMAN. WHEN I WAS A KID YOU POPPED  OUT OF THE WOMB AND YOU KNEW,  YOU KIND OF HAD A FEEL FOR  IT.
WELL, THOSE WERE THE  DAYS.
Stephen: THEY WERE. NOW YOU SAY-- YOU SAY--  YOU  SAY I'M OVERSTATING THE  CASE. BUT YOU ALSO SAY IN HERE  THAT ENGLISH MAJORS ARE AT  AN ALL-TIME LOW.
THE FIGURES ABOUT WHO  MAJORS IN WHAT ISN'T THE  MOST IMPORTANT THING. IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH  EMPHASIS. WE ARE TALKING IN FAVOR OF  THE SUPPORT OF A BROAD  VERSION OF EDUCATION THAT  ARCHES FROM THE SCIENCES TO THE HUMANNITIES, THAT STARTS  EARLY AND CONTINUES ALL  THROUGH PEOPLE'S LIVES. THAT'S WHAT GIVES PEOPLE THE  FULL SET OF EQUIPMENT THEY  NEED FOR EMPLOYMENT, FOR PERSONAL PLEASURE, FOR ALL  THE THINGS THAT EDUCATION  HAS BEEN --
OKAY. BUT YOU'RE--   (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY, YOU  KNOW, YOU-- YOU'RE A  HUMANNITIES GUY AND SO YOU THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE  HUMANITIES IN OUR LIVES. BUT IF YOU WERE NOT THE  PRESIDENT OF DUKE BUT  INSTEAD WERE PERHAPS THE  PRESIDENT OF A TECHNICAL TRAINING INSTITUTE.
OKAY.
Stephen: WOULDN'T YOU BE  TALKING ABOUT THE BEAUTY OF  DRAINING FREON FROM AN AC  UNIT?
WELL, I WILL TELL YOU,  THIS COMMISSION THAT I  CO-CHAIRED HAD ON IT SOME PRESIDENTS OF UNIVERSITIES,  IT HAD ON IT SOME SCHOLARS  BUT IT ALSO HAD THE C.E.O. OF BOEING. IT HAD THE FORMER GOVERNOR  OF TENNESSEE WAS A MEMBER ON  IT, IT HAD THE PERSON WHO HEADS THE LARGEST COMMUNITY  COLLEGE IN AMERICA. AND ALL OF THEM ARGUED FOR  THE LONG-TERM VALUE OF THE  KIND OF THINS THAT THE  HUMANNITIES TEACHES. ALL OF THEM DID. I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING  ESPECIALLY INTERESTING, THE  FORMER PRESIDENT OF M.I.T. WHO IS NOW THE HEAD OF THE  NATIONAL ACADEMY OF  ENGINEERS WAS ON OUR  COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW, HE SAYS ENGINEERS  NEED TO DO MORE THAN  ENGINEERING. THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO  COMMUNICATE IN ORDER FOR THE  FULL VALUE OF THEIR  EDUCATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LET ME TELL YOU  THIS IS THE REPORT. IT'S CALLED THE HEART OF THE  MATTER. I SEE YOU SPRUNG FOR THE  FANCY BINDER TO TRY TO GET A  BETTER GRADE. BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT  SOMETHING HERE. LOOK AT YOUR MARGINS. LOOK AT YOUR MARGINS, RIGHT  HERE. YOU'RE CLEARLY TRYING TO  STRETCH THIS. IF YOU PROPERLY FORMATTED  THIS IT WOULD BE LIKE 8  PAGES LONG.
ALL SERIOUS READERS KNOW  THAT MARGINS ARE TO KEEP  YOUR NOTES IN.
Stephen: GLAD I'M NOT A  SERIOUS READER. I WOULD FEEL BAD THAT I  DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
CAN I-- YOU'RE A BIT OF  AN EXPERT ON MELVILLE AND  HAWTHORNE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: CAN I ASK YOU  SOMETHING ABOUT MELVILLE  ABOUT MOBBEE DICK.
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT'S A BIG  BOOK, OKAY. I'VE GOT A BUCHL COPY OF IT,  HAND TOOLED LEATHER,  EVERYTHING. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO CRACK  IT OPEN BECAUSE IT WILL RUIN  THE RESALE VALUE. IS MOBY DICK A METAPHOR FOR  THE STRUGGLE OF TRYING TO  READ MOBY DICK? (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)
YOU MISSED YOUR CALLING  AS A LITERARY CRITIC.
Stephen: I'VE GOT A  FALLBACK POSITION. HOW DOES THAT PAY? (LAUGHTER)
I THOUGHT WE ALREADY  COVERED THAT.
Stephen: WELL, PROFESSOR,  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THE PRESIDENT OF  DUKE UNIVERSITY. BE AN ENGLISH MAJOR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
