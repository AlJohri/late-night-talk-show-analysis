Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW, I TRY NOT TO REPEAT MYSELF, BUT I HAVE LONG WARNED YOU, I HAVE LONG WARNED YOU ABOUT THE SCOURGE OF GAY MARRIAGE. WELL, YESTERDAY, IT MAN-ON-MANAGED TO SPREAD TO THE PLACE I CARE ABOUT THE THE MOST.
A GROUNDBREAKING RULING AS SOUTH CAROLINA BECOMES THE 33rd STATE IN THE NATION TO RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
A FEDERAL JUDGE IN SOUTH CAROLINA STRIKING DOWN THAT STATE'S BAN ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
THE JUDGE IN SOUTH CAROLINA RULED THAT STATE'S BAN WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
Stephen: A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS RULED THAT SOUTH CAROLINA MUST RECOGNIZE GAY MARRIAGE? THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS! WHEN DID SOUTH CAROLINA START RECOGNIZING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN. FOLKS AS A NATIVE SON OF THE PALMETTO STATE, I AM DEEPLY DISTURBED. THIS IS THE WORST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO SOUTH CAROLINA SINCE SOMEONE FOUND MARK SANFORD.   ( APPLAUSE ) THIS RULING IS A SURRENDER TO THE GAY AGENDA, OR AS WE CALL IT, THE WAR OF SAME-SEX AGGRESSION. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THE FLAG FLYING ON OUR STATE CAPITOL GROUNDS WILL LOOK LIKE THIS. AND, FOLKS, IT IS THE STARS AND BARS, NOT THE STARS AND GAY BARS. , OF COURSE, IN ALL OF THIS, THERE IS ONE PERSON I FEEL MOST FOR HERE-- ME. BECAUSE SOUTH CAROLINA IS WHERE I TRADITIONALLY MARRIED MY FEMALE WIFE WOMAN, LORRAINE. AS GOD INTENDED. AND AS WAS THE ONLY LEGAL OPTION AT THE TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) SENT, YEARS LATER, YEARS AFTER I HAVE SPENT WITH MY BEAUTIFUL BRIDE, ALL OF THAT SEEMS LIKE A TOTAL WASTE. I MEAN-- I-- WOULD I HAVE GOTTEN GAY MARRIED IF I COULD AT THE TIME? , OF COURSE, NOT. DID I HAVE SOMEONE IN MIND? WHO'S ASKING? WAS IT BRAD? DOES HE EVER MENTION ME? I, FOR ONE, WILL NEVER FORGIVE THIS ACTIVIST JUDGE WHO BROUGHT GAY MARRIAGE TO MY STATE AND WHOSE NAME WILL LIVE IN INFAMY, RICHARD GERGEL. IN FACT, I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF AFTER THIS SCANDALOUS GAY MARRIAGE RULING ANYONE IN SOUTH CAROLINA EVER NAMED THEIR CHILD DICK GERGEL. BECAUSE YOU, SIR, YOU, HAVE FOREVER TARNISHED THE REPUTATION OF OUR FAIR STATE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU HAVE FOREVER TARNISHED THE REPUTATION OF OUR STATE, WHICH SAYS A LOT BECAUSE SOUTH CAROLINA HAS DONE SOME ( BLEEP ). WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
