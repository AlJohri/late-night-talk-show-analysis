Stephen:  TONIGHT, IS THERE  A DOWNSIDE TO WINDMILLS. WELL, THEY'RE ALWAYS IN THE WAY  AT MINI GOLF? WELL PRINCIPAL WEAPONS END ALL  GUN CONTROL AND DOES THAT MAKE  HEWLETT-PACKARD THE H-P-N-R-A? AND MY GUEST, DR. DANIEL  LIEBERMAN, IS A HARVARD  PROFESSOR WHO STUDIED LONG  DISTANCE RUNNING, OR AS I CALL IT, DRIVING. A PRISON INMATE IS SUING TACO  BELL FOR STEALING HIS DORITOS  TACO SHELL IDEA. AND, ALSO, FOR HIS DORITOS TACO  SHIV IDEA. THIS IS THE THE "COLBERT  REPORT."   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. OH! MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE HEROES ARE  ON FIRE. FOLKS, I HOPE YOU KNOW, FOR  OBAMA WATCHDOGS LIKE ME, THE  LAST WEEK OF SCANDALS HAS BEEN LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING. ( LAUGHTER )  AND SPEAKING OF CHRISTMAS, WHY  ARE ALL THE PRESENTS WRAPPED? WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO HIDE? ( LAUGHTER )  NOW, OF COURSE, OBAMA HAS BEEN  IN FULL DAMAGE CONTROL TRYING TO  WIGGLE OUT OF THIS ONE, JUST LIKE ME WIGGLED UP ON THE OF  SERVING IN VIETNAM. ( LAUGHTER )  SORRY, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU CAN'T  ESCAPE THIS TIME BY CLAIMING TO  BE EIGHT YEARS OLD. ( LAUGHTER )  AND IT'S NOT JUST OBAMA, FOLKS. YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT SENT  ATTORNEY GENERAL AND  CONGRESSIONAL PINATA ERIC HOLDER INTO THE SARLAAC PIT OF CAPITOL  HILL.
ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER  WAS ON THE HOT SEAT WEDNESDAY. PRESSED FOR ANSWERS BY THE HOUSE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
ERIC HOLDER IS BEING GRILLED  ON A COUPLE OF SCANDALS THAT ARE  ROCKING THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC  HOLDER GRILLED BY LAWMAKERS.
GRILLED BY CONGRESS.
GETTING PEPPERED WITH  QUESTIONS.
Stephen:  MMM, GRILLED AND  PEPPERED. THAT EXPLAINS WHY DARRELL ISSA  WAS WEARING THAT "KISS THE COOK"  APRON. NOW, HOLDER DESPERATELY SPARRED  WITH THE GREAT MINDS ON THE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, BUT THEN HE BIT OFF MORE THAN HE COULD CHEW. WHEN HE RAN UP AGAINST  CONGRESSMAN AND MAGICAL TALKING  CANTALOUPE LOUIE GOHMERT'S QUESTIONS ABOUT THE F.B.I.'S  INVESTIGATION INTO THE BOSTON  BOMBERS.
YOU STATE AS A MATTER OF FACT  WHAT THE F.B.I. DID AND DID NOT  DO. YOU SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW THAT. AND YOU HAVE CHARACTERIZE THE  F.B.I. AS BEING NOT THOROUGH. I KNOW WHAT THE F.B.I. DID. YOU CANNOT KNOW WHAT I KNOW. THAT'S ALL.
I CANNOT HAVE A--
REGULAR ORDER.
CHALLENGE MY CHARACTER.
MR. CHAIRMAN. REGULAR ORDER, PLEASE.
GENTLEMEN, WE'LL--
WITHOUT RESPONDING TO THAT.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE  STATEMENTS THAT WHAT I SAID WAS  NOT TRUE WHEN ACTUALLY THE REVERSE IS WHAT HAPPENED. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FAILED TO  ANSWER MY QUESTION ABOUT--
GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN.
...CHAIRMAN.
ASPERSIONS ON MY ASPARAGUS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  DARE YOU CAFTA,  SPERGZS ON THAT MAN'S ASPARAGUS! WHAT IS NEXT, SIR, LIABLING HIS  LETTUCE? QUESTIONING HIS QUINOA. ARGUING WITH HIS ARUGULA. VILLIFYING HIS VINAIGRETTE  BEFORE DRIZZLING IT ON THE  SCANDAL SALAD? CLEARLY, NATION, WE ARE GOING TO  NEED A LOT MORE HEARINGS ON  ASPARAGUS-GATE BECAUSE THE MORE I DIGEST THIS, THE WORSE IT  SMELLS. NOW, NATION--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I HAVE HEARD-- THEY ARE CLAPPING  WITH ANGER! NATION, I'VE HEARD THAT IF YOU  DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE SAY,  DON'T SAY IT AT ALL. THE GUY WHO TOLD ME THAT WAS AN  IDIOT. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF  THE FINGER  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  FOLKS, I HAVE LONG WARNED YOU ABOUT THE DANGERS OF AMERICA'S  WILD RUSH FOR WIND POWER, GUSTY  GOLD THE BUBBLIN' BREEZE. WELL, NOW THAT RUSH HAS CLAIMED  INNOCENT LIVES.
IT'S A FEDERAL CRIME TO KILL  THE GOLDEN EAGLE. GOT THAT. ABOUT ONCE A MONTH A GOLDEN  EAGLE IT KILLED BY A WINDATURE  BY.
Stephen:  FOLKS WHEN I SEE  THE MAJESTIC CREATURES  SENSELESSLY CUT DOWN IN THEIR PRIME ALL I CAN SAY IS IN YOUR  FACE, TREE HUGGERS! NOW I KNOW WHY YOU'RE UNDER THAT  TREE. BECAUSE IT'S RAINING DEAD  EAGLES. IT IS TIME YOU SMUG ECO-NUTS  LEARN THERE IS NO MAGICAL FUEL  SOURCE THAT DOESN'T HAVE CURSED, MONKEY PAW-LIKE CONSEQUENCES,  EXCEPT, OF COURSE, THE CURSED  MONKEY-POWERED CAR. IT'S FOOL PROOF-- IF YOU'RE  STUCK IN TRAFFIC, JUST PET THE  PAW AND THE ROADS WILL CLEAR BUT YOU CAN'T SEE THE ROAD BECAUSE  YOUR GLASS BROKEN AND YOU'LL  NEVER BE ABLE TO READ ALL THOSE  BOOKS! DAMN YOU! THAT'S WHY I'M ISSUING A FIRM  WAG OF MY MAN PAW AT WIND  TURBINES, OR AS I NOW CALL THEM, EAGLE GRINDERS. ( LAUGHTER )  THE WORST PART IS THEY ARE  GETTING AWAY WITH SKY MURDER  BECAUSE WHILE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS PROSECUTED  OIL COMPANIES, WHEN BIRDS DROWN  IN WASTE PITS, AND POWER COMPANIES WHEN BIRDS ARE  ELECTROCUTED BY POWER LINES,  THEY HAVE NEVER PROSECUTED A WIND ENERGY COMPANY.
AND KNOW WHY. IF A POLITICIAN SAID I WILL CALL  A HEARING TO BREAK BIG OIL,  EVERYBODY CHEERS. BUT IF YOU SHOUT, "I WILL BREAK  BIG WIND," THEY JUST LAUGH AT  YOU. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  AND THE WIND LOBBY'S MASSIVE  INFLUENCE LED ONE FORMER U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE AGENT  TO SAY IF YOU ELECTROCUTE AN  EAGLE, THAT IS BAD. BUT IF YOU CHOP IT TO PIECES,  THAT IS OKAY. AND IF YOU DICE IT AND THROW IT  IN A WORK WITH A SOY GINGER  SAUCE, THAT IS HEAVENLY. NOT THAT I'VE DONE THAT. AND IF I HAVE, I WORK FOR A WIND  COMPANY. NEXTUM ON THE T-WAGS, IT'S NO  SECRET THAT CHINA IS EMERGING AS  A SUPERPOWER TO BE RECKONED  WITH. I MEAN, IF THEIR DEAD PEOPLE CAN  PLAY FOOTBALL AND CONDUCT  ORCHESTRAS, IMAGINE WHAT THEIR LIVE ONES CAN DO. AND, FOLKS, A RECENT NEWS STORY  PROVED THAT CHINA'S QUEST FOR  INFLUENCE KNOWS NO BOUNDS.
CHINA HAS LAUNCHED A MIDDLE  EAST PEACE PROPOSAL DURING  VISITS FROM THE LEADERS OF ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN  AUTHORITY IN A SIGN OF BEIJING'S  DESIRE FOR A LARGER ROLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, CHINESE LEADER HI  JIN PING LAUNCHED A POWER-POINT  PEACE PROPOSAL CALL FOR AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE,  ALONGSIDE ISRAEL.
Stephen:  CHINAMENTS IN ON  MIDDLE EAST PEACEMAKING, AND IT  COULD WORK. THEY ARE EXPERTS AT GETTING  LONGTIME ENEMIES TO EXIST SIDE  BY SIDE. JUST LOOK AT BEEF AND BROCCOLI. ( LAUGHTER )  AND THAT IS WHY TONIGHT, I AM  ISSUING A WAG OF MY FINGER AT  CHINA. LISTEN UP, COMRADES! BROKERING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE  EAST IS AMERICA'S JOB. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  YEAH. SO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR PLANS  ARE, BUT, PLEASE, DON'T TAKE  OVER OUR ROLE AS MIDDLE EAST  PEACEMAKER. I MEAN, WE LOVE PUTTING OUR  POLITICS AND OUR INTERNATIONAL  REPUTATION RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF  MISTRUST AND HATRED. OH! OH! AND WE'RE SO CLOSE, TOO. I MEAN, WE'VE REALLY-- WE'VE  REALLY WARMED UP THAT OLD HOLLY  LAND SLOT MACHINE. I MEAN, IT'S JUST ABOUT READY TO  PAY OUT IN NOBEL PRIZES. IF YOU JUMP IN NOW, YOU'LL GET  ALL THE CREDIT, AND-- AND OUR  AFEXATE NICKNAME, THE GREAT  SATAN. PLUS ALL THE FREE EFFIGIES WILL  YOU CAN BURN. BUT I GUESS YOU GUYS WIN. TAKE THE MIDDLE EAST. WE'LL BE OVER HERE PAINTING  AFGHANISTAN. IT SURE IS FUN. ( LAUGHTER )  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
