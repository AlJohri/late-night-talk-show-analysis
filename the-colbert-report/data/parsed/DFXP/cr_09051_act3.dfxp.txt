[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT  BELIEVES THAT ENVIRONMENTALISTS  SHOULD CONSIDER NUCLEAR POWER. I'LL SEE IF I CAN MAKE HIM  MELTDOWN. PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL  SHELLENBERGER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: I KNOW YOU ARE AN  ENVIRONMENTALIST BECAUSE YOU ARE  NOT WEARING A TIE.
YES.
Stephen: BUT YOU ARE  RADICAL BECAUSE YOU ARE VERY  WELL COIFFERD.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU ARE PRESIDENT  AND COFOUNDER OF BREAKTHROUGH  INSTITUTE COAUTHOR OF THE BOOK BREAKTHROUGH WHICH MADE A SPLASH  A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND A NEW  E-BOOK. WHAT IS YOUR NEW IDEA FOR SAVING  THE ENVIRONMENT?
THE BIG IDEA IS WE SPENT 20  YEARS ON GLOBAL WARMING TRYING  TO MAKE FOSSIL FUELS MORE  EXPENSIVE. THAT DIDN'T WORK. THERE'S AN IMPORTANT SHIFT THAT  NEEDS TO BE MADE TO MAKING CLEAN  ENERGY SAFE.
Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR IDEA  CLEAN COAL?
ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES.
Stephen: CLEAN COAX YOU ARE  ON BOARD.
IF THEY CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY  TO CHEAPLY CAPT TIEWRT COAL IT  NEEDS TO BE PUT ON THE LIST.
Stephen: CLEAN COOL. THAT TAKES CARE OF ALL OF IT. YOU ARE NOT LIKE A TREE HUGGER  KIND OF GUY, RIGHT?
I AM SORT OF A TREE HUGGER.
Stephen: YOU ARE? THEY DON'T HUG YOU BACK. IT'S A ONE-WAY RELATIONSHIP.
MOST PEOPLE WHAT THEY CARE  ABOUT IS, YOU KNOW, THINGS ON  THE ECONOMY AND JOBS. I THINK WE SAY LOOK, WE ALL CARE  ABOUT THE SAME THINGS. WE WANT THE SAME THINGS FROM  ENERGY, WE WANT IT TO BE CHEAP,  RELIABLE AND INCREASINGLY CLEAN. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN OVER  THE CENTURIES. WE'VE GONE FROM WOOD TO COAL,  COAL TO GAS AND RENEWABLES. IT'S DONE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY  INNOVATIONS. IT'S SOMETHING AMERICANS ARE  GOOD AT.
Stephen: SO YOU ARE ON  BOARD FOR THE NUKES?
YEAH, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE I  WAS REALLY IN LOVE WITH SMALL IS  BEAUTIFUL WITH SOLAR PANELS ON MY ROOF AND ELECTRIC CAR IN THE  DRIVEWAY AND WIND FARMS AND A  NUMBER OF OUR  FRIENDS POINTED OUT TO US LOOK THE SUN DOESN'T  ALWAYS SHINE, THE WIND DOESN'T  ALWAYS BLOW AND THE WORLD WILL CONSUME TWICE AS MUCH ENERGY BY  2050 AS IT DOES TODAY. WE NEED A LOT OF INNOVATION TO  MAKE CLEAN ENERGY A LOT CHEAPER.
Stephen: WHY NOT  CONSERVATION? YOU ARE SAYING WE'RE IF THE  GOING TO USE MORE ENERGY. I LOVE USING ENERGY, DON'T GET  ME WRONG. I TURN ON A LIGHT IN A ROOM IN  MY HOUSE IT STAYS BURNING UNTIL  I GO TO BED. I WANT IT TO BE THERE WHEN I  LEAVE LIKE IT'S MY FRIEND  WAITING FOR ME. WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE OUT THE  HOUSE FEELS SAD.
THE ECONOMY IS MORE EFFICIENT  AT USING ENERGY OVER TIME BUT WE  FIND NEW USES FOR ENERGY. BUT CONASSUMPTION IS GOING UP. MOST THINK WE'LL DOUBLE AS MUCH  BY 2050 AS CHINA, AND INDIAN AND  BRAZIL GET HIGHER LIVING STANDARDS LIKE THE UNITED STATES  AND EUROPE. IF YOU WANT TO AVOID DANGEROUS  LEVELS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND  CLEAN AIR YOU NEED MORE CLEAN ENERGY AND MOST OF IT HAS TO BE  FROM CLEAN SOURCES STEENCHT YOU  DON'T FEEL LIKE THE OLD JIMMY CARTER WEARING A SWEATER LET'S  ALL MAKE OUR CLOTHING OUT OF  HEMP ENVIRONMENTALIST TO ME. WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU  BREAKTHROUGH GUYS?
I THINK THIS IS THE CENTRAL  ISSUE IT'S ABOUT EMBRACING  TECHNOLOGY. THAT'S WHY WE WROTE THE BOOK  CALLED "LOVE YOUR MONSTERS."  WE SHOULD TREAT OUR TECHNOLOGIES LIKE OUR CHILDREN BEGUN OUR  CREATIONS. WHEN THEY FAIL US, WHEN THEY  DISAPPOINT US YOU DON'T ABANDON  THEM, YOU IMPROVE THEM. MAKE THEM BETTER.
Stephen: YOU SAY LIKE  FRANKEN STYNE.
EXACTLY. ONE OF ESSAYS IS WE  MISUNDERSTOOD FRANKEN STYNE. THE LESSON IS NOT TO CREATE NEW  TECHNOLOGIES OR LIFE EVEN THE  LESSON IS WE SHOULD NEVER ABANDEN OUR CREATIONS. DR. FRANKEN STYNE SAW THE  CREATION, IT WASN'T LIKE HE  EXPECTED IT AND HE ABANDONED IT. THAT'S WHAT TURNED HIS CREATURE  INTO A MONSTER.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT  NUCLEAR ENERGY BECAME FOR US IN  THE 70s. THREE MILE ISLAND WE ABANDONED  IT EVEN THOUGH IT NEEDED LOVE,  EVEN THOUGH IT HAD THROWN THAT GIRL IN THE LAKE. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE TECHNOLOGY WE USED TO  POWER NUCLEAR SUBMARINES IT WAS  THE WRONG TECHNOLOGY. THERE'S MUCH BETTER.
Stephen: WHAT KIND OF  TECHNOLOGY?
LIQUID METAL, FUELS, OTHER  FUELS.
Stephen: SORIIUM. I SEE THAT ONLINE ALL THE TIME.
THERE'S A HALF DOZEN  TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVEN'T DONE  ENOUGH TO PUSH. IN 1994 CONGRESS CUT AN  IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM. IT GOT CONFUSED WITH NUCLEAR  WEAPONS. COUNTRY DON'T PURSUE NUCLEAR  WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE --
Stephen: YOU BELIEVE IRAN  IS NOT PURSUING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
NEW YORK CITY THEY ARE. WE KNOW THAT.
Stephen: YOU JUST SAID THEY  ARE NOT. YOU ARE NOT WEARING A TIE AND A  BEARD. ARE YOU IRANIAN.
IRAN WANTS A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THERE'S 33 COUNTRIES IN THE  WORLD WELL NUCLEAR ENERGY AND  THE CAPABILITY TO WILD A BOMB AND THEY DON'T WANT IT.
Stephen: YOU ARE IN A FILM  IN THE SUNDANCE FEST VAL CALLED  PANDORA'S PROMISE. YOU COME OUT AS PRONUCLEAR  ENERGY. THAT'S LIBERAL HEAVEN. BOB REDFORD STARTED THE SUNDANCE  FESTIVAL. CAN YOU SAY PRONUKE AROUND HIM. LEGALLY REDFORD COULD HUNT YOU  FOR SPORT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU ARE OSTRACIZED FOR SAYING  THINGS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE TO  EMBRACE COAL, NATURAL GAS,  FRACKING? AND NUKES. YOU ARE MY KIND OF LIBERAL. GOOD LUCK GET US TO LOVE FRANKEN  STYNE.
THANKS, ST
