(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU, FOLKS, I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THE WORLD OUT THERE IS SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL. THE MIDDLE EAST IS IN FLAMES. RUSSIAN TROOPS HAVE CROSSED INTO UKRAINE, BUT THE BIGGEST NEWS THIS WEEKEND WAS THE SHOCKING INVASION OF BOOB-ISTAN. JIM.
A HACKING SCANDAL IS ROCKING HOLLYWOOD THIS MORNING.
A USER ON THE POPULAR PHOTO-SHARING SITE 4CHAN POSTED PERSONAL RISQUE PHOTOGRAPHS SUNDAY OF NUMEROUS A-LIST CELEBRITIES IN VARIOUS STATES OF UNDRESS.
A-LIST STARS LIKE JENNIFER LAWRENCE, KATE UPTON.
SINGERS RIHANNA AND ARIANA GRANDE AND MORE THAN 100 OTHER FAMOUS WOMEN IN WHAT MANY CALL THE BIGGEST CELEBRITY HACKING EVER.
Stephen:  THE STORY, I BELIEVE, WAS BROKEN-- STORY, I BELIEVE, WAS BROKEN BY 14-YEAR-OLD BENJAMIN PEARLMAN OF AKRON, OHIO WHO HAS DILIGENTLY SPENT THE LAST YEAR GOOGLING THE PHRASE "KATE UPTON NAKED." GREAT INVESTIGATIVE WORK, BENJAMIN. I'D LIKE TO SHAKE YOUR HAND. ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT? ON SECOND THOUGHT, THUMBS UP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). APPARENTLY, UNNAMED 4CHANERS WERE ABLE TO ACQUIRE THE PHOTOS FROM APPLE'S ICLOUD. ACCORDING TO SECURITY EXPERTS IT'S POSSIBLE THE HACKED CELEBRITIES HAD EASY TO GUESS PASSWORDS RATHER THAN STRONGER PASS PHRASES THAT ARE LONG AND HARD TO GUESS SUCH AS  1 DAY I ATE 364 BANANAS & 13 CHERRY PIES. ALTHOUGH, I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS WHICH CELEBRITY HAS THAT PASSWORD. HE IS NO STRANGER-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE IS NO STRANGER-- ( APPLAUSE ) NO STRANGER TO NUDE SCANDAL, BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE PICTURE OF HIM WEARING CLOTHES. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, I CONDEMN THIS GROSS VIOLATION OF PRIVACY BECAUSE EVERYONE TAKES NUDE SELFIES NOWADAYS. KEEP YOUR PHONE IN YOUR POCKET RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR GENITALS. IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY GET TOGETHER AFTER A COUPLE OF DRINKS. I STAND WITH THE HUFFINGTON POST WHICH PUBLISHED A SEARING OP-ED SHAMING ANYONE WHO LOOKED AT OR SHARED THESE PHOTOS. SO DO NOT-- I MEAN THIS-- DO NOT LOOK AT THESE PHOTOS. YOU DON'T NEED TO. INSTEAD, CHECK OUT ALL THE SIDEBOOB AND NIP SLIP ON HUFFPO'S ACTUAL SIDEBOOB PAGE. THERE'S JENNIFER LAWRENCE FLASHING SIDEBOOB AT THE ROME FILM FESTIVAL. THAT'S WHY I CALL THE -THE MORAL FULCRUM OF THE INTERNET. OF COURSE, THE INTERNET ISN'T THE ONLY PLACE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL SECURE. THERE'S ALSO EVERYWHERE ELSE. TAKE LAST MONTH'S UNREST IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI. IT RAISED A LOT OF TROUBLING QUESTIONS. FOREMOST AMONG THEM-- IS JAKE TAPPER GOING TO BE OKAY?
THESE ARE ARMED POLICE WITH SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES WITH BATONS, WITH SHIELDS, MANY OF THEM DRESSED FOR COMBAT. NOW, WHY THEY'RE DOING THIS, I DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE THERE IS NO THREAT GOING ON HERE, NONE, THAT MERITS THIS. THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON, ON THIS STREET RIGHT NOW, THAT MERITS THIS SCENE OUT OF BAGRAM, NOTHING. WHAT IS THIS? THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
Stephen:  NOW, JAKE IS A FRIEND SO IT IS WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT I SAY YOU'RE AN IDIOT. ( LAUGHTER ) THE COPS DON'T NEED ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS BECAUSE THERE'S NO VIOLENCE. THERE WAS NO VIOLENCE BECAUSE THE COPS HAVE ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS. SAME REASON I DON'T NEED TO HAVE SEX BECAUSE I'M CARRYING A CONDOM. ( LAUGHTER ) 9/11 SHOWED US JUST HOW VULNERABLE WE ARE TO VIOLENT ATTACK. THAT'S WHY TODAY I LIVE IN THE GATED COMMUNITY WITH A FENCE NO TERRORIST COULD POSSIBLY BREACH, UNLESS THEY SOMEHOW ACQUIRE STOOL TECHNOLOGY. ( LAUGHTER ) SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THE SAME STATE-OF-THE-ART SECURITY CAMERAS THAT PROTECT TIMES SQUARE ALSO PROTECTS SCOTSBLUFF, NEBRASKA, POPULATION 15,039. SORRY, AL QAEDA, BUT THE HISTORIC LAKE MINA-TARE LIGHTHOUSE WILL NEVER STOP SHINING. WHAT'S THAT? IT'S NOT A FUNCTIONAL LIGHTHOUSE? YOU WIN THIS ROUND, BIN LADEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE, CAMERAS ALONE WON'T SECURE OUR SHORES, SO CONGRESS PASSED THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE EXCESS PROPERTY PROGRAM WHICH DISTRIBUTES SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT'S ALL PART OF THE PENTAGON'S ONGOING "TAKE A TANK, LEAVE A TANK" PROGRAM. AND IT HAS DONE WONDERS FOR LITTLE TOWNS LIKE KEENE, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHICH OBTAINED A SURPLUS $286,000 BEARCAT ARMORED VEHICLE, WHICH THEY SAID THEY NEEDED BECAUSE THE THREAT IS FAR-REACHING AND OFTEN UNFORESEEN. KEENE CURRENTLY HOSTS SEVERAL LARGE PUBLIC FUNCTIONS TO INCLUDE AN ANNUAL PUMPKIN FESTIVAL. ( LAUGHTER ) DEFINITELY A TARGET. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AMERICA'S PREMIERE PUMPKIN FESTIVAL. NEED PROOF? NAME ANOTHER ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT'S NOT JUST SPREADING TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES, FOLKS. FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE ALSO FORMING SWAT TEAMS, INCLUDING THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD, THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN A GENETICALLY MODIFIED EAR OF CORN MIGHT COME AROUND LOOKING FOR A LITTLE PAYBACK. FOLKS -- ( APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, AS A GREAT JOURNALIST ONCE SAID--
WHAT IS THIS? THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
Stephen:  HERE TO MAKE SENSE OF WHATEVER IT IS IS FORMER SEATTLE POLICE CHIEF NORM STAMPER. NORM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. NORM, YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF RANKING RANK, A TOP COP EXPOSE OF THE DARK SIDE OF AMERICAN POLICING. OKAY, YOU WERE THE POLICE CHIEF OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON. YOU DID SOME GOOD WORK THERE. FOR INSTANCE, IN 1999, THE WTO, WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, MEETING WAS GOING ON IN SEATTLE. THINGS WENT CRAZY. WHAT DID YOU DO?
WELL, WE GASSED NONVIOLENT, NONTHREATENING PROTESTERS.
Stephen:  GOOD FOR YOU. GOOD FOR YOU. OKAY. YOU HAVE CALLED THAT THE WORST MISTAKE OF YOUR CAREER. WHY? IS IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW TODAY THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER WEAPONS YOU COULD USE AGAINST NONVIOLENT PROTESTERS. YOU COULD USE A SOUND CANNON NOW.
LOOK, WE HAD ALL OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS OUT THERE, THOSE ON THE FRONT LINE, IN MILITARY GARB, CARRYING MILITARY WEAPONS AND ENGAGING IN AGGRESSIVE MILITARY ACTIONS AGAINST NONVIOLENT PROTESTERS. WE THOUGHT WE HAD TO DO THAT. WE BELIEVED WE NEEDED, FOR EXAMPLE, TO CLEAR A PARTICULAR INTERSECTION. WELL, DID WE REALLY? DID WE HAVE TO CLEAR THAT INTERSECTION?
Stephen:  THEY SMASHED THE WINDOWS OF A STARBUCK. DON'T YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SHOOT RUBBER BULLETS.
THEY WENT BEYOND SMASHING THE WINDOWS. THEY ACTUALLY TOOK COFFEE FROM THAT STORE AS WELL, IN SEATTLE.
Stephen:  I BELIEVE AVENTI IS GRAND THEFT.
I BELIEVE IT IS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  BUT POLICE ARE THERE TO SERVE AND PROTECT, RIGHT?
THEY ARE.
Stephen:  ISN'T A BIGGER GUN OR MORE WEAPONRY JUST MORE SERVING AND BIGGER PROTECTION? ( LAUGHTER ).
STEPHEN, THIS MILITARIZATION MOVEMENT IS EXACERBATING A REALLY STRAINED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICE AND COMMUNITY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. NO MORE THAN IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITH POOR PEOPLE AND YOUNG PEOPLE, AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS, BEING PART OF, NOT APART FROM OUR COMMUNITY.
Stephen:  WHY WOULD THE POLICE WANT TO BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY? BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY IS WHERE THE CRIMINALS LIVE?
WELL, BECAUSE, THIS IS AMERICA.
Stephen:  OKAY.
AND THE IDEA BEHIND THAT-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  YOU JUST PLAYED THE "THIS IS AMERICA" CARD.
I CERTAINLY DID.
Stephen:  IT'S TECHNICALLY MY CARD. BUT GO AHEAD. ( LAUGHTER ).
WELL, I STAND CORRECTED.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD. IT'S AMERICA.
I THINK IT'S VITAL THAT POLICE OFFICERS ESTABLISH GENUINE PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.
Stephen:  SO THE POLICEMEN GET THE EQUIPMENT. HERE'S ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THE PENTAGON PROGRAM IS YOU REQUEST THE EQUIPMENT. YOU HAVE TO DECLARE THE NEED. BUT IF YOU DON'T USE IT WITHIN ONE YEAR, YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE EQUIPMENT BACK. AND SO, THE POLICE SAY THEY NEED IT FOR SOMETHING, AND THEN THEY USE IT TO PROVE THAT THEY NEEDED IT, PROVING THAT THEY DID. DOESN'T THAT MEAN THE SYSTEM IS WORKING? ( LAUGHTER )
WHAT THAT DOES IS CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR POLICE OFFICERS TO GET INTO ONE OF THOSE ARMORED VEHICLES ARMED TO THE TEETH, AND IN A PREDAWN DRUG RAID OF A FAMILY HOME, HIT A SUSPECTED LOW-LEVEL, NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENDER WHO WAS SEEN TO BE IN POSSESSION OF HALF A BAG OF MARIJUANA. THAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen:  ARE YOU SAYING THIS STUFF CAME ORIGINALLY-- IT'S NOT TERRORISM? IT CAME FROM THE DRUG WAR?
IT BEGAN WITH THE DRUG WAR.
Stephen:  OKAY, SO HOW DO WE FIX THAT, THEN?
WE END THE DRUG WAR. WE END IT YESTERDAY.
Stephen:  OKAY. UM-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOLD ON. MR. STAMPER, ARE YOU HIGH?
NO. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  YOU'RE NOT HIGH?
I'M NOT.
Stephen:  YOU'RE NOT HIGH.
NO.
Stephen:  I'M NOT WEARING A WIRE. YOU CAN TELL ME.
WE HAVE WITNESSES.
Stephen:  ON AVERAGE, THERE WERE ABOUT 3,000 SWAT TEAMS RAIDS EVERY YEAR. THERE ARE 50,000 SWAT TEAM RAIDS EVERY YEAR NOW. WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE SURE THAT NEVER HAPPENS TO ME? ( LAUGHTER )
WELL, BEHAVE YOURSELF. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, I AM.
AND SECONDLY, WORK WITH YOUR NEIGHBORS. WORK WITH YOUR COMMUNITY. ORGANIZE, MOBILIZE, TELL YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND THESE MILITARY TACTICS EMPLOYED IN EVERYDAY, ROUTINE, SOMETIMES NOT-SO-ROUTINE CIRCUMSTANCES.
Stephen:  UM, WELL, UM, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I HOPE THERE'S NEVER A REASON TO HAVE YOU BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NORM STAMPER, THE AUTHOR OF "BREAKING RANK." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
