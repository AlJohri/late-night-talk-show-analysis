Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. NATION, I AM A HUGE FAN OF  COUNTRY MUSIC. FROM HANK WILLIAMS TO LUCINDA  WILLIAMS TO VENUS AND SERENA WILLIAMS. THEY ARE TO COUNTRY MUSIC WHAT  BROOKS AND DUNN ARE TO TENNIS. AND MY FAVORITE COUNTRY SINGER IS BRAD PAISLEY. I LOVE ALL HIS SONGS FROM  ALCOHOL TO CAMOUFLAGE TO TOOTHBRUSH TO CHICKEN CHET. HE WRITES A LOT OF HIS SONGS INSPIRED BY VALIDATING HIS  IDENTITY AT WEBSITES. BUT NOW PAISLEY IS INSPIRED BY A MUCH HIGHER GOAL: SOLVING  RACISM. FOLKS, LET'S TAKE A LITTLE LISTEN TO PAISLEY'S NEW SONG "ACCIDENTAL RACIST." ♪ TO THE MAN THAT WAITED ON ME  AT THE STARBUCKS DOWN ON MAIN ♪♪  ♪ I HOPE YOU�� UNDERSTAND ♪ IS ♪ WHEN I PUT ON THAT TEE-SHIRT,  THE ONLY THING I MEANT TO SAY IS I'M A SKYNYRD FAN ♪♪ THE RED FLAG ON MY CHEST SOMEHOW  IS LIKE THE ELEPHANT IN THE CORNER OF THE SOUTH ♪♪
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. CALM DOWN, AFRICAN-AMERICAN BARISTAS. EVERYONE KNOWS THIS FLAG UP HERE  JUST MEANS SOMEONE'S A SKYNYRD FAN. THE SAME WAY THAT BURNING A  CROSS JUST MEANS SOMEONE'S A MADONNA FAN. BY THE WAY, JEFFERSON DAVIS, HUGE SKYNYRD FAN. GOT ON BOARD WAY EARLY. FOLKS, PAISLEY IS SO COMMITTED  TO KICK STARTING A DIALOGUE  BETWEEN BLACKS AND WHITES THAT HE EVEN STARTED ONE MID SONG WITH N.C.I.S. GLOSS STAR LINEBACKER L. COOL ., WHO -- AND  I DID NOT KNOW THIS -- IS ALSO AN ASPIRING RAPPER. JIM? ♪ GEE, MR. WHITE MAN, I WISH YOU  UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE WORLD IS  REALLY LIKE WHEN YOU'RE LIVING IN THE HOOD ♪♪ ♪ JUST BECAUSE MY PANTS ARE  SAGGING DOESN'T MEAN I'M UP TO KNOW GOOD. I'D LIKE TO BUY YOU A BEER,  CONVERSATE AND CLEAR THE AIR BUT  I SEE THAT RED FLAG AND I THINK YOU WISH I WASN'T HERE.  ♪♪  I'M JUST A WHITE MAN ♪♪  ♪ IF YOU DON'T JUDGE MY  DO-RAG ♪♪ ♪ COMIN' TO YOU FROM THE SOUTH LAND ♪♪ ♪ I WON'T JUDGE YOUR RED FLAG ♪  ♪ TRYIN' TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO NOT BE ♪♪ I'M PROUD OF WHERE I'M FROM ♪♪
Stephen: THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD DEAL, PAISLEY. L.L. WILL FORGET 250 YEARS OF  ENSLAVEMENT IF YOU ACCEPT HIS TASTE IN ACCESSORIES. NATION, I THOUGHT RACISM ENDED  WHEN WE ELECTED THE FIRST BLACK  PRESIDENT BUT IT TURNS OUT HE WAS JUST THE OPENING ACT. BECAUSE THIS SONG HAS UNITED ALL  AMERICANS NOT JUST BLACK AND  WHITE BUT LATINO, ASIAN, MUSLIM, PACIFIC ISLANDER, INUIT. ALL OF US TO JOIN OUR VOICES AS ONE AND DECLARE: THIS SONG  SUCKS! (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I'VE GOT TO SAY, THIS LEVEL OF  UNIFYING SUCKAGE HAS INSPIRED ME  TO WRITE MY OWN AWFUL SONG... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ... IN THE HOPES OF BRIDGING  ANOTHER DEEP CULTURAL RIFT IN AMERICA: THE GAY MARRIAGE  DIVIDE. SO TONIGHT I'D LIKE TO PRESENT A  SONG I'M CALLING "OOPSY DAISY HOMO PHONE."  JIM-IT.
