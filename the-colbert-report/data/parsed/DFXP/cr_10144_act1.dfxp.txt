Stephen: TONIGHT, DOES RACISM STILL EXIST IN AMERICA OR IS THAT JUST AN UGLY RUMOR SPREAD BY THOSE LYING NORWEGIANS? THEN, CHANGE HAS COME TO A CLASSIC BOARD GAME, CANDYLAND NOW COMES WITH AN INSULIN PUMP. AND MY GUEST MICHAEL SHEEN PLAYS A 1960s RESEARCHER OF HUMAN SEXUALITY, YET ANOTHER JOB MADE OBSOLETE BY THE INTERNET. A NEW STUDY SAYS BREAKFAST IS NO LONGER THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY. IT HAS FALLEN TO 8th PLACE. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU, WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS, EVERYBODY. IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE. AS I SAID, FOLKS, FOLKS, IT'S SO GOOD. IT'S SO GOOD. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU KNOW I NEED YOUR ENERGY, FOLKS IT IS SO GOOD. IT IS SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. AND IT'S GOOD TO HAVE ME WITH YOU. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. BECAUSE FOLKS, I WAS ON BREAK THE LAST TWO WEEKS, FINALLY GOT TO SOME LONG DELAYED PROJECTS IN MY WOODWORKING SHOP. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE SOME REALLY NICE BOOK ENDS BUT I CAN NEVER QUITE GET THEM TO MATCH. SO INSTEAD, I WON TWO EMMIES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHAT-- [BLEEP] YEAH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHAT-- [BLEEP] YEAH. POINT IS, THE POINT IS, FOLKS, THESE ARE MEANINGLESS. AND I WILL KILL YOU IF YOU TRY TO TAKE THEM. THE POINT IS, I'M BACK. WHICH IS GOOD. BECAUSE WITHOUT ME AROUND FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS THE WORLD WENT AND THREW A BIG OLD TRAGEDY PARTY IT WAS LIKE DON'T TELL MOM THE BABY-SITTER'S DEAD EXCEPT EVERYONE IS DEAD. AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM MOM IN A WHILE. I'M WORRIED BUT VIOLENCE ESCALATED IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE EASTERN, MIDDLE EAST AND MOST UNSTABLE OF ALL, THE MIDDLE WEST. JIM?
18-YEAR-OLD MICHAEL BROWN WAS SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES BY A POLICE OFFICER IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.
WITNESSES SAY BROWN HAD HIS HANDS UP AND WAS SURRENDERING WHEN HE WAS SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES.
BROWN'S DEATH HAS SPARKED A WEEK OF PROTESTS, LOOTING, A SHOOTING AND SOMETIMES VIOLENT RESPONSES FROM POLICE.
SADLY FERGUSON MISSOURI IS NOW BEST KNOWN FOR RACIAL CONFLICT, POLICE BRUTALITY AND VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS. AND NOT AS THEY CLAIM PROUDLY ON THE OFFICIAL CITY WEBSITE, FOR FOOD TRUCK MONDAYS. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE NOW THIS IS THE FOOD TRUCK. AND IT SERVES FRESH, HIGH VELOCITY RUBBER BURRITOS. AND THE HOT PEPPER SAUCE IS NOT OPTIONAL. FOLKS, THIS IS A GENUINE TRAGEDY THAT MANY ARE SAYING IS THE FOUL HARVEST OF OUR RACIST PAST. BUT I URGE EVERYONE TO WAIT TO PASS JUDGEMENT ON OFFICER DARREN WILSON. SOME ARE RUSHING TO JUDGE THIS MAN AS A VIOLENT RACIST COP WHO GUNNED DOWN AN UNARMED BLACK TEENAGER. BUT OTHERS ARGUE THAT HE IS A HEROIC POLICE OFFICER DOING HIS JOB BY GUNNING DOWN AN UNARMED BLACK TEENAGER. (LAUGHTER) BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS RACIST OR EVEN IF RACISM STILL EXISTS. I FOR ONE DON'T SEE RACE. NOT EVEN MY OWN. PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND I BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I KEEP ASKING WAITERS ABOUT GLUTEN. WHAT WE DO KNOW, WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THE SHOOTING OF AN UNARMED YOUNG BLACK MAN IS A STORY WE'VE HEARD FAR TOO MANY TIMES BEFORE. AND THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE WE NEVER HEAR IT AGAIN IS FOR THE PRESS TO STOP REPORTING IT.
I THINK THE COVERAGE HAS BEEN A TRAVESTY. LOOK AT IT FIRST FROM THE STANDPOINT OF QUANTITY. HOW DID THIS INCIDENT JUSTIFY HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF NONSTOP HOURS OF COVERAGE WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON IN THE WORLD.
THERE ARE A LOT OF BAD THINGS THAT I THINK HAVE COME FROM JOURNALISTS BEING THERE AND FROM ALL THE 24/7 MEDIA SPECULATION. AND I THINK ONE IS THAT IT'S PROBABLY MADE THINGS MORE VOLATILE.
I WROTE A COLUMN FOR FOX THIS WEEK SAYING JUST THEORETICALLY FLOATING THE IDEA, WHAT IF ALL THE JOURNALISTS IN THIS TOWN PACKED UP THE EQUIPMENT AND LEFT. WOULD THAT HAVE HAD AN IMPACT ON THE VIOLENCE. A LOT OF PEOPLE RESPONDED AND SAID YES.
YES, I RESPOND. IT'S TRUE. THE PRESENCE OF A CAMERA CLEARLY MAKES PEOPLE BEHAVE RECKLESSLY. BECAUSE I DONE BELIEVE FOR A MINUTE THAT HOWIE KURTZ WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE IDEA THAT JOURNALISTS ARE TO BLAME FOR THE FERGUSON VIOLENCE IF A CAMERA WASN'T POINTED AT HIM. FOR HIS OWN SAFETY GET THIS MAN OFF OF TELEVISION. IS THERE NOTHING--  (APPLAUSE)
IS THERE NOTHING TO BE GAINED? AND THERE IS NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY INFLAMING THE VOLATILE SITUATION OTHER THAN A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY.
THE FUND-RAISING EFFORT HAS RAISED MORE MONEY THAN THE MICHAEL BROWN MEMORIAL SUNDAY ON THE WEB SITE.
FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR WILSON'S LEGAL FEES HAVE REACHED AROUND $400,000.
EVEN THE MISSOURI CHAPTER OF THE KU KLUX KLAN HAS A FUND-RAISER PLANNED FOR WILSON.
EVEN THE LLAN IS PITCHING IN. I BELIEVE THEY HELD A BIKINI CAR WASH. NOW FOLKS -- BIKINI CAR WASH. THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. NOW AS IT STANDS SUPPORTERS OF OFFICER WILSON HAVE CROWD SOURCED MORE MONEY THAN SUPPORTERS OF MICHAEL BROWN. YET SOMEHOW NEITHER HAVE RAISED MORE MONEY THAN THE GLYPH MOBILE PERSONAL THEATRE. THIS IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS. THAT GUY, HE CAN'T SEE RACE OR THE TRUCK THAT IS ABOUT TO HIT HIM. AND WHILE MORE MONEY IS GOING TO OFFICER WILSON, BROWN SUPPORTERS ARE BEING BACKED BY AN ORGANIZATION WITH NO RESPECT FOR THE LAW. THE WHITE HOUSE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS SENDING THREE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TO ATTEND BROWN'S FUNERAL IN ST. LOUIS MISSOURI.
THEY SENT THREE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TO THE FUNERAL OF MICHAEL BROWN. WHEN MARGARET THATCHER DIED LAST YEAR THEY SENT NOBODY. IN WHAT UNIVERSE DOES MARGARET THATCHER, ONE OF THE GREATEST LEADERS MERIT NOBODY AND MICHAEL BROWN MERITS 3 WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS.
THE PRESIDENT SAYS A DELEGATION TO FERGUSON YET HE SENT NOT ONE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TO INVESTIGATE THE MURDER OF MARGARET THATCHER. (APPLAUSE) AT THE VERY LEAST HE COULD HAVE SENT ANGELA LANDSBURY. WITH EMOTIONS BOILING ON BOTH SIDES PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING  TO CALL FOR THE UNTHINKABLE. A RATIONAL DISCUSSION.
WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO TALK ABOUT INCIDENTS OF RACE.
WE STILL NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ON RACE IN AMERICA.
IT IS IMPORTANT WE HAVE OPEN DIALOGUE ABOUT THE REALITIES OF ISSUES LIKE THIS.
I THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION LONG AFTER THE MICHAEL BROWN CASE IS DONE.
THIS IS AGAIN ANOTHER TIME TO HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION ABOUT RACE IN SOCIETY.
WELL, IF THERE HAS TO BE A FRANK AND HONEST NATIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT RACE IN AMERICA, I GUESS I'M ALREADY TALKING. I'LL GO FIRST FOLKS, OUR NATION HAS A LONG SHAMEFUL LEGACY OF SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS.  AND I'LL GRANT YOU THINKS AREN'T COMPLETELY EQUAL WHITE PEOPLE HAVE BETTER ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND ARE REGARDED WITHOUT SUSPICION BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, BLACK PEOPLE GET TO USE THE N-WORD. CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON THAT. IF YOU COULD, CLIVEN BUNDY AND HIS BUDDIES MIGHT HAVE PAID IT. BY THE WAY BLACK PEOPLE, WHY CAN'T YOU BE MORE LIKE THESE GUYS. THEY WERE ARMED AND THEY DARED THE COPS TO SHOOT THEM AND NOTHING HAPPENED. JUST FIGURE OUT WHATEVER WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM AND YOU'LL BE FINE. (LAUGHTER) BUT THAT'S JUST ONE PERSPECTIVE. THAT'S JUST ONE, MINE. MINE IS JUST ONE VOICE. I'M JUST ONE PERSPECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION ON RACE. THIS IS A DIALOGUE. SO NOW I CEDE THE FLOOR TO ONE OF THE BLACK LATE NIGHT HOSTS TO RESPOND IN JANUARY OF 2015. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
