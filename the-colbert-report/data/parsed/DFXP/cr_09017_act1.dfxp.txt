Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  "REPORT"! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! PLEASE, EVERYBODY, PLEASE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US AND,  FOLKS, IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK. FIRST OF ALL I'M OKAY. (LAUGHTER)  HOW'S EVERYBODY HERE? EVERYBODY OKAY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FULL DISCLOSURE: THIS ISN'T  ACTUALLY MY AUDIENCE. WE'RE ACTUALLY ONE AGO SHELTER  TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST  HERE TO RECHARGE THEIR IPHONES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND TO TAKE A BUM SHOWER IN THE  BATHROOM SINK. (LAUGHTER)  LITTLE GAMEY. BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL COME THROUGH  ONE HELL OF A STORM, FOLKS. OF COURSE, OUR THOUGHTS AND  PRAYERS ARE WITH THE 60 MILLION  AMERICANS THROUGHOUT 20 STATES  WHO HAVE BEEN HIT BY HURRICANE  SANDY. THIS RECORD SURGE HAS DEVASTATED  COMMUNITIES FROM NORTH CAROLINA  TO MAINE. 62 PEOPLE AT LEAST HAVE DIED. POWER STATION EXPLOSIONS AND  DOWNED LINES HAVE LEFT EIGHT  MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT  ELECTRICITY-- INCLUDING NEW YORK CITY BELOW 39th STREET. IN NEW JERSEY, THE NATIONAL  GUARD HAS BEEN SENT IN TO RESCUE  MORE THAN  20,000 TRAPPED HOBOKEN  RESIDENTS. 100 HOMES BURNED TO THE GROUND  IN BREEZY POINT, QUEENS. THE LARGEST SINGLE FIRE IN NEW  YORK CITY HISTORY. AN ENTIRE TOWN ON THE JERSEY  SHORE HAS BEEN SUBMERGED. IT'S AN UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY  WHERE THE SCOPE OF THE DAMAGE IS  STILL UNFOLDING. FOR THOSE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE  WATCHING THIS SHOW TONIGHT, I  URGE YOU TO VISIT redcross.org  TO FIND OUT HOW YOU CAN ASSIST THOSE IN NEED. SPOILER ALERT: IT'S MONEY. (LAUGHTER)  I'D ALSO LIKE TO SINGLE OUT SOME  HEROES. LIKE THE NURSES AT N.Y.U. HOSPITAL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AFTER THE HOSPITAL'S GENERATORS  FAILED, THESE NURSES CARRIED 20  NEWBORNS DOWN NINE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS WHILE MANUALLY OPERATING  RESPIRATORS. I CAN'T EVEN WALK DOWN NINE  FLIGHTS OF STAIRS WITHOUT A  SPOTTER. (LAUGHTER)  THEN THERE WAS THIS CITY WORKER  PHOTOGRAPHED BY ONE OF MY  WRITERS WHO, MID-HURRICANE,  CLIMBED A TREE WITH A CHAIN SAW TO REMOVE LOOSE BRANCHES THAT  COULD HAVE CRUSHED PEOPLE IF  THEY WERE CAUGHT IN THE WIND. NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW  THIS, BUT IN A TREE WITH A CHAIN  SAW IS THE SAFEST PLACE TO BE IN  A HURRICANE. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, I WANT TO GIVE SPECIAL  SHOUTOUTS TO THE GUY IN CHARGE  OF NEW JERSEY.
TODAY I TOURED THE JERSEY  COASTLINE BABY HELICOPTER AND I  LANDED IN TWO SPOTS ON THE  JERSEY SHORE AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN DEVASTATION  LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE. WE'RE MIXING SORROW WITH  DETERMINATION. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AS A  STRONG AND RESOLUTE PEOPLE TO  MAKE SURE WE REBUILD OUR STATE  AND DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.
Stephen: WOW, THAT GUY IS  INCREDIBLE. I JUST WISH I KNEW HIS NAME OR  HIS TITLE. (LAUGHTER)  OH, THERE YOU GO. CHRIS CHRISTIE, GOVERNOR! ALL RIGHT, THERE IT IS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  GOOD THING HIS MOM SEWED HIS  NAME INTO ALL OF HIS CLOTHES  BEFORE HE WENT OFF TO GOVERNOR  CAMP. (LAUGHTER)  AND STORM NATION, THINGS ARE NOT  MUCH BETTER IN NEW YORK. THE M.T.A. REPORTED THAT SANDY  FLOODED SEVEN SUBWAY TUNNELS  UNDER THE EAST RIVER. WHICH MEANS IT COULD BE WEEKS  BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE TO RESTORE  THE SCENT OF URINE. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S WHY I AM CALLING ON NEW  YORK DRUNKS TO HEAD INTO THE  SUBWAY AND RELEASE THEIR  STRATEGIC BLADDER RESERVES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE POINT IS IT APPEARS THAT WE  GOT MANHATTAN WET, WHICH I'M  PRETTY SURE VOIDS THE WARRANTY. (LAUGHTER)  AND THERE ARE NO LENAPE INDIANS  AROUND TO GIVE US BACK OUR  BEADS. OH, YOU WIN THIS TIME, EXTINCT  TRIBE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT BEFORE THE STORM HIT I HOPE  YOU ALL FOLLOWED MY STORM PREP  INSTRUCTIONS. DUCT TAPE THE WINDOWS, FILLED  YOUR BATHTUBS WITH FRESH WATER  AND BUILT AN ARK. (LAUGHTER)  ONE OF EVERY ANIMAL, ONLY  FEMALES. THEN ADD ONE VERY RANDY POODLE. (LAUGHTER)  THEY CAN MATE WITH ANYTHING,  THAT WAY WE REPOPULATE THE EARTH  WITH A HYPOALLERGENIC ANIMAL  KINGDOM. YOU GET YOUR ELEPHANT-A-POOS. (LAUGHTER)  YOUR ROCO-DOODLES. THEY'RE GREAT WITH KIDS WHO  DON'T MAKE SUDDEN MOVES. (LAUGHTER)  OF COURSE, WITH ALL THIS HEART  BREAKING DEVASTATION, THERE'S  REALLY ONLY ONE QUESTION ON EVERYONE'S MIND.
HOW WILL THIS AFFECT ELECTION  DAY?
WITH MUCH OF THE EAST COAST  BATTERED BY SANDY ONLY SEVEN  DAYS FROM THE ELECTION, HOW WILL  IT IMPACT THE RACE?
IT'S MOTHER NATURE'S OCTOBER  SURPRISE. A STORM SO BIG AND SO  DESTRUCTIVE IT COULD THROW THE  CAMPAIGN'S FINAL WEEK INTO  CHAOS.
Stephen: YES, ALL ACROSS THE  COUNTRY PEOPLE WERE FRANTICALLY  TEXTING THEIR LOVED ONES. "YOUR FATHER AND I ARE OR  WORRIED, HAVE YOU SEEN THE  LATEST TRACKING POLLS OF  UNDECIDED SUBURBAN WOMEN IN OHIO?"  (LAUGHTER)  AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOLKS, THIS  HURRICANE HAS GOT "ELECTION" ALL  OVER IT! OUT OF SENSITIVITY, LESS THAN  ONE WEEK FROM ELECTION DAY MITT  ROMNEY HAS BEEN FORCED TO  SUSPEND HIS CAMPAIGN! THAT'S WHY HE SCRAPPED HIS  VICTORY RALLY IN KETTERING, OHIO  AND INSTEAD APPEARED AT A  COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THE SAME SPOT --  (LAUGHTER)  -- WITH THE SAME PEOPLE AND  CALLED IT A STORM RELIEF RALLY. WHICH IS SO COMFORTING FOR ALL  THOSE LIVING ON OHIO'S HARD-HIT  ATLANTIC COAST. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  NOW, AT THE STORM RELIEF  NOT-CAMPAIGN EVENT, MITT AIRED A  BIOGRAPHICAL VIDEO THAT WAS PART OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL  CONVENTION AND THE PRESS BADGES  CALLED IT A VICTORY RALLY. BUT HE WAS CLEARLY THERE FOR THE  CANNED GOODS.
WE'RE GOING TO BOX THESE  THINGS UP IN JUST A MINUTE AND  PUT THEM ON SOME TRUCKS AND  WE'RE GOING TO SEND THEM INTO UH UH -- I THINK IT'S NEW JERSEY. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: BOY, THAT REALLY  WARMS MY UH -- UH -- I THINK  IT'S MY HEART? (APPLAUSE)  AND, FOLKS, IT'S NOT -- ONE OF  THOSE ORGANS. JUST ONE OF THEM. FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST THE  HURRICANE THAT'S HURTING ROMNEY  HERE. HE HAS TO DEAL WITH ANOTHER  THREAT THAT CAN BE SEEN FROM  SPACE, CHRIS CHRISTIE. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, AS I SAID EARLIER -- AS I  SAID EARLIER, HE HAS DONE A  GREAT JOB, BUT HE'S SO  INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF HIS CONSTITUENTS THAT I  THINK HE'S LOST SIGHT OF WHAT'S  REALLY IMPORTANT!
IF YOU THINK RIGHT NOW I GIVE  A DAMN ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL  POLITICS THAN YOU DON'T KNOW ME. I SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT THREE  TIMES YESTERDAY. HE CALLED ME FOR THE LAST TIME  AT MIDNIGHT ASKING WHAT HE CAN  DO. HE'S BEEN INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE  AND HELPFUL TO OUR STATE AND NOT  ONCE DID HE BRING UP THE  ELECTION. I SAID IF YOU COULD EXPEDITE THE  MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION  WITHOUT THE NORMAL FEMA MUM BOW  JUDGE BOY, HE GOT RIGHT ON IT AND THIS MORNING I UNDERSTAND HE  HE SIGNED A DISASTER DECLARATION  FOR NEW JERSEY. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ALL OVER  THIS AND HE DESERVES GREAT  CREDIT.
Stephen: OH, COME ON! YOU'RE PRAISING OBAMA JUST  BECAUSE HE DECLARED NEW JERSEY A  DISASTER AREA? JOHNNY CARSON DID THAT FOR 30  YEARS! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  HAY-OH! THANK YOU, MICHAEL. STAY DRY UP THERE. FOLKS, IT'S ONE WEEK BEFORE THE  ELECTION AND CHRISTIE IS  PRAISING A DEMOCRAT. WHAT'S NEXT? A DEMOCRAT PRAISING CHRISTIE? IT'S UNNATURAL! IT'S LIKE KISSING YOUR SISTER! WHICH, BY THE WAY, WILL BE  FEDERAL LAW IF OBAMA IS  REELECTED. (LAUGHTER)  THEN TODAY CHRISTIE AND OBAMA  WENT ON A TOUR OF HURRICANE  DAMAGE. BARACK OBAMA STOLE MITT'S DATE  TO DISASTER-PROM! FOLKS, NONE OF THIS SURPRISES  ME. NONE OF IT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NONE OF THIS SURPRISES ME. HURRICANES HAVE A WELL-KNOWN  LIBERAL BIAS. FIRST KATRINA TAINTED GEORGE  BUSH'S PRESIDENCY. THEN ISAAC WIPED OUT THE FIRST  DAY OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL  CONVENTION. NOW HURRICANE SANDY. SANDY, WHAT KIND OF NAME IS  THAT? ARE YOU A DUDE STORM OR A LADY  STORM? OH, BIG SURPRISE, JUST WHEN  OBAMA NEEDS A BOOST, WHO SHOWS  UP BUT A GENDER-AMBIGUOUS  WEATHER SYSTEM, A CATEGORY 5 BY CURE CANE. (LAUGHTER)  HEY, HEY, DON'T GET ME WRONG, I  DON'T MINE YOU BEING A  HEMISPHERIC SCALE METEOROLOGICAL  EVENT, BUT WHY MUST YOU BE SO FLAMBOYANT AND IN MY FACE ABOUT  IT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NO, I'M HURRICANE SANDY, DEAL  WITH ME! NOW, MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOLKS, THE  HURRICANE AGENDA IS TO MAKE THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOOK  NECESSARY! (LAUGHTER)  WELL, MITT ROMNEY UNDERSTANDS  THAT DISASTER RELIEF BELONGS  ONLY ON THE STATE LEVEL. AS HE EXPLAINED WHEN ASKED ABOUT  HIS PLANS FOR FEMA DURING A  PRIMARY DEBATE.
EVERY TIME YOU HAVE AN  OCCASION TO TAKE SOMETHING FROM  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SEND  IT BACK TO THE STATES, THAT'S THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND IF YOU GO EVEN FURTHER AND  SEND IT BACK TO THE PRIVATE  SECTOR, THAT'S EVEN BETTER.
Stephen: RIGHT! WE SHOULD MAKE DISASTER RELIEF  THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE  STATES. WHO BETTER TO RESPOND TO WHAT'S  GOING ON INSIDE ITS OWN BORDERS  THAN THE STATE WHOSE  INFRASTRUCTURE HAS JUST BEEN SWEPT OUT TO SEA? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SO PLEASE, PLEASE FOLKS --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT'S BAD, BUT LET'S NOT FREAK OUT OVER  HURRICANE SANDY AND THINK WE  NEED THE FEDS! THE| RESPONSE SHOULD SIMPLY BE  HANDLED BY WHATEVER INDIVIDUAL  STATE IS THE ENTIRE EASTERN SEA  BOARD. (LAUGHTER)  AND IN A ROMNEY ADMINISTRATION  INSTEAD OF DEPENDING ON BIG  GOVERNMENT YOU'LL BE RESCUED BY PRIVATE-SECTOR VOLUNTEERS LIKE  PAUL RYAN WHO WILL PERSONALLY  COME TO YOUR DEVASTATED TOWN AND  WASH YOUR ALREADY-CLEAN POTS. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
