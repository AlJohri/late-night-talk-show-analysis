WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, I'VE GOT TO SAY WITH ALL  THE DEPRESSING NEWS ABOUT  POSSIBLE WAR WITH NORTH KOREA AND THE ENDLESS DEBATE OVER G.I. GUN VIOLENCE I JUST WANT TO  LIGHTEN THE MOOD A LITTLE AND  TALK ABOUT THE MASSIVE OIL SPILL IN MAY FLOWER, ARKANSAS. THE HISTORIC SITE WHERE THE  MAYFLOWER LANDED. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. THE PILGRIMS LANDED AT LITTLE  ROCK, I THINK. ALL I KNOW IT WAS DEFINITELY  ARKANSAS BECAUSE THEY CAME OVER  ON AN ARK. YOU MIGHT BE ASKING, STEPHEN WHY  HAVEN'T WE HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT  THE CLEANUP OF THE RUPTURE OF THE PEGASUS PIPELINE? BECAUSE EXXON HAS CONTAINED THE  CLEANUP COVERAGE BY THREATENING  TO HAVE REPORTERS ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING AND AT EXXON'S  REQUEST, ITS F.A.A. ORDERED A NO  FLY ZONE OVER THE AREA AND EVERYONE IS RESPECTING THE NO  FLY ZONE, ESPECIALLY THE BIRDS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NOT EVERYONE IS HEEDING THE  CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED  EXXON PRESS BLACKOUT. SOME LEFTY GROUND WATER HUGGER  SNUCK PAST IT AND BROKE INTO  ARKANSAS. THIS IS VIDEO BY ACTIVITIES WITH  THE GROUP.
THIS IS WHERE THEY PUMP THE  OIL THAT SPILLED INTO THE  NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY PUMPED IT INTO THIS  WETLAND.
ERIC SAYS HE SPOKE WITH  EYEWITNESSES WHO CLAIMED WORKERS  POWER WASHED OIL INTO STORM  DRAINS.
Stephen: OF COURSE IT'S  GOING INTO THE STORM DRAINS. THEY ARE JUST PUTTING IT BACK  UNDERGROUND WHERE IT CAME FROM. IT'S CALLED RECYCLING, DUH! ANY ENVIRONMENTALISTS DON'T GET  YOUR HEMP PANTIES IN A BUNCH  BECAUSE EXXON'S DISASTER RELIEF TEAM HAS THE SITUATION UNDER  CONTROL.
THE WORKERS HAVE BEEN THERE. THEY ARE USING SOME KIND OF  QUILTED PAPERTOWEL TO TRY TO  SOAK THINGS UP. THESE ARE THEIR PAPER TOWELS.
Stephen: CLEARLY THEY ARE  TAKING THE SPILL SERIOUSLY OR  THEY WOULDN'T HAVE SPRUNG FOR THE QUILTED. EXXON IS EMPLOYING A TIME HONORS  CLEANUP TECHNIQUE PIONEERED BY  DRUNK GUYS. THROW PAPER TOWELS DOWN ON  WHATEVER YOU SPILLED JUST GET  OUT OF THERE. THERE ARE OTHER DRUNK GUY  OPTIONS LIKE HIDING THE SPILL A  STRATEGICALLY PLACED COFFEE TABLE OR BETTER YET JUST FLIP  ARKANSAS OVER LIKE EYE COUCH  CUSHION. THE POINT IS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE POINT IS EXXON HAS GOT THIS  ONE WITH THE PAPER TOWELS. I'M SURE THEY'LL ALSO REPLENISH  WHATEVER FOREST HAD TO BE CLEAR  CUT AND PULPED TO MAKE THAT MANY  PAPERTOWELS. THEY'LL REPLANT WITH IT NEW  TREES THAT WILL NEVER DIE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
