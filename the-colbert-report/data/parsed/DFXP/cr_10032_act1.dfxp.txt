TONIGHT, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A STATE LEGALIZES MARIJUANA?  FOR THE FIRST FIVE HOURS, VERY LITTLE.
THEN REPUBLICANS REACH OUT TO WOMEN, AND THE WOMEN GET A RESTRAINING ORDER. AND MY GUEST ALAN MULALLY IS THE CEO OF FORD. OH, I LOVE THAT NEW GUEST SMELL. ACTORS, HACKERS HAVE STOLEN THE BASS WORDS OF OVER 2 MILLION PA ACCOUNTS, SO IT IS TIME TO CHANGE MINES FROM PASSWORD1 TO PASSWORD2.  THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) .. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
STEPHEN!  STEPHEN!  STEPHEN!
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE ENERGY IN THIS ROOM, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I FEEL LIKE I AM AN AUCTION AND I AM A PRIZE CALF. THE HAT OF THE MEAT, A LOT OF THE MAJOR STORIES TO COVER TONIGHT. MASSIVE ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTS BREAKING OUT IN UKRAINE, ATTACK ON THE DEFENSE MINISTRY IN YES MEN, THOUSANDS OF FAST FOOD WORKERS ON STRIKE ACROSS HUNDREDS OF CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, SO WE DIVE RIGHT IN AND READ SOME VIEWER MAIL.
FOLKS, GOT A BIG FILE RIGHT HERE. OUR FIRST LETTER TONIGHT COMES TO US ON ACTUAL PAPER. DEAR STEPHEN, WHICH POWER IS BETTER, FLIGHT OR INVISIBILITY?  I AM ASKING FOR A FRIEND. SINCERELY, STEPHEN COLBERT, BUT NOT YOU. THAT'S NICE, STEVEN, I RECOGNIZE MY OWN HANDWRITING. OKAY, LET'S SETTLE THIS ONE, FOR ONCE AND ALL, OBVIOUSLY FLIGHT AND INVISIBILITY HAVE BIG PROS AND CONS. FLIGHT, PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE I AM SCARED OF HEIGHTS, BUT SO IS INVISIBILITY, BECAUSE I AM SCARED OF PEOPLE NOT NOTICING ME. SO THAT'S A TIE. ONE POINT EACH. NOW LET'S TALK THE ECONOMICS OF THE SITUATION. THE MOST RECENT SUPERMAN GROSSED $291 MILLION AT THE BOX OFFICE BUT THE "LORD OF THE RINGS" GROSSED 377 MILLION. CLEARLY, THE MARKET SAYS INVISIBILITY, NOT TO MENTION, THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET IS INVISIBLE. DOUBLE WIN FOR INVISIBILITY, TWO INVISIBLE THUMBS UP.
NOW, AS LONG -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: PEOPLE LOVE THE INVISIBILITY. AS LONG AS WE ARE TALKING SUPER MAN, FOLKS, WITH FLIGHT, YOU COULD FLY AROUND THE WORLD BACKWARDS TO REVERSE TIME, THAT'S A HUGE POWER, BUT WITH INVICTIM, YOU CAN GO TO A DINNER PARTY AND NOT HAVE TO DRINK TWO GLASSES OF RED WINE BEFORE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE.
AGAIN, ONE POINT EACH.
OF COURSE YOU HAVE GOT TO REMEMBER, ONLY YOUR BODY TURNS INVISIBLE. NOT ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF IT, THAT'S WHY THE INVISIBLE MAN HAD TO GET NAKED TO DISAPPEAR. SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A CLUSTER OF FLOATING CAR KEYS, COINS AND CELLPHONES, THEY ALL HAVE TO GO UP THE BUTT. NO, NO, HEY. I'M SORRY. YOU HAVE GOT TO IT. TO IT'S NATURE'S POCKETS SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETHINK THAT BOTTLE OPENER KEY RING. FOLKS, I WOULD SAY THAT CLINCHES IT, ALSO, IT CLENCHES IT. ALL RIGHT. FLIGHT WINS!  NO MORE ON THE SUBJECT. JIM, LET'S CLOSE THE IN-BOX.
FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW YOU KNOW I A AM NO FAN OF GAY MARRIAGE, BUT IT ISN'T THE ONLY MORAL SINKHOLE SLOWLY SWALLOWING AMERICA. THERE IS ALSO THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION, WHICH ALSO LEADS TO GAY MARRIAGE, BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE GOT THE MUNCHIES BAD ENOUGH YOU WILL PUT ANYTHING IN YOUR MOUTH.
SUDDENLY, SUDDENLY, WHOA, THAT, YOU HEAR THAT FOLKS?  THAT WAS THE GASP OF RECOGNITION.
SUDDENLY, FOLKS, A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS FAVOR DECRIMINALIZING SATAN'S OREGANO WITH 58 PERCENT FOR IT AND ONLY 39 PERCENT OPPOSED. WHICH MEANS IF YOU TOOK A VOTE TODAY, POT STILL BE ILLEGAL, BECAUSE 58 PERCENT OF THE VOTERS WOULD BE AT HOME ATTEMPTING TELEKINESIS ON A BURRITO. PLUS YOU KNOW WHO IS REALLY HIGH?  GALLUP POLLSTERS BECAUSE THOSE NUMBERS ONLY ADD UP TO 97 PERCENT:FOLKS, I SAY IT IS MORE -- IT IS MORE THAN JUST CHANGING OPINIONS, BECAUSE LAST YEAR, VOTERS IN COLORADO LEGALIZED IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I HAVE WATCHERS, FIRST TIME ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD MARIJUANA HAS BEEN REGULATED FROM SEED TO SALE, IT WILL BE LEGAL FOR EVERYONE TO BUY WEED FROM A RECREATIONAL DISPENSARY.
RECREATIONAL SALES IN COLORADO ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN JANUARY 1ST, 200014.
THAT'S RIGHT. JANUARY 1ST, OR AS THEY CALL IT IN COLORADO, FOUR-20.
FOLKS, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LEGAL RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALL GAME FROM MEDICAL MARIJUANA, WHICH IS USED TO TREAT NAUSEA, GLAUCOMA, AND THE TERMINAL LACK OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA.
SOON, SOON, FOLKS, BUYING WEED IN COLORADO WILL BE AS EASY AS BUYING CIGARETTES.
HOW MIGHT IT IN DA HOW MIGHT IT BE SOLD.
THIS IS WHAT AMERICANS ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SORT OF SUBSTANCE. IT WILL BE SOLD A LITTLE LIKE YOU SELL TOBACCO IN THESE SHOPS, ALONG IN GLASS CONTAINERS JUST LIKE THIS. IT IS GOING TO BE LIKE WALKING INTO A CIRCLE K. AS SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT A COLORADO, CHOLERA DON YOU CAN WALK IN, STARTING JANUARY 1ST, AND YOU CAN BUY UP TO A QUARTER OUNCE.
YOU CAN BUY ALL YOU WANT.
YES, YOU CAN BUY WEED ALL DAY LONG, IT WILL BE LIKE THE PARKING LOT AT A PHISH CONCERT, AND BEST OF ALL, PHISH ISN'T PLAYING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE HAVE SOT PHISH FANS HERE TONIGHT. AND THE DARK, SHADY I HAVE OF LEGAL POT IS BECOMING SO MAINSTREAM THE DENVER POST JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL HIRE A POT EDITOR. IT WILL BE EASY TO IDENTIFY THE COLUMN BECAUSE IT WILL JUST BE A HANDWRITTEN NOTE ASKING FOR AN EXTENSION. FOLKS, COME ON, IF WE ARE ALL ADULTS.
ALL OF US KNOW WHERE THIS LEADS. THE POT EDITOR IS JUST A GATEWAY JOB TO A METH EDITOR. WHOSE COLUMNS ARE 2-CENT METERS WIDE, 30 FEET LONG AND WRITTEN WITH A BROKEN CHICKEN BONE. YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE HIGH TO THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. HERE NOW TO TELL ME IF IT IS A GOOD IDEA IS THE NEW POT EDITOR OF THE DENVER POST, RICHARD BACA, MR. BACA, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: MR. BACA, FIRST QUESTION, ARE YOU A COP?  BECAUSE IF YOU ARE A COP AND YOU DON'T TELL ME THIS IS ENTRAPMENT.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN A COP, NO. I AM A.
I HAVE BEEN -- 20 YEARS.
Stephen: OKAY. AND HOW DO YOU GET THIS JOB AS A JOURNALIST?
WE WERE ALL SITTING AROUND ONE NIGHT AND WENT, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GREAT?  TO GET PAID TO DO THIS!  WELL, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN COVERING THE BEAT PRETTY INTENTLY.
Stephen: OH, I BET YOU HAVE. I BET YOU HAVE. ARE YOU HIGH RIGHT NOW?  ARE YOU HIGH RIGHT NOW?
I AM DEFINITELY NOT HIGH RIGHT NOW.
ARE YOU SURE?  MY FACE ISN'T A GIANT BEAK?  AM I FREAKING YOU OUT RIGHT NOW?  HUH?  WE ARE GOING DOWN THE HALLWAY AND TAKING TURNS. YOU ARE NOT HIGH NOW, BUT DO YOU SMOKE POT AT ALL?
I DON'T SMOKE POT. I DO EAT IT, THOUGH.
Stephen: OH, OKAY.
OH. OH. OKAY. HOW IS THIS GOING TO BE REGULATED, SIR?
WELL, PRETTY INTENSELY BY THE STATE, YOU KNOW, THE STATE HAS A HISTORY WITH REGULATING MEDICAL MARIJUANA, SO THEY ARE KIND OF TAKING WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED THERE AND APPLYING IT TO RETAIL/RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA, WHICH BECOMES LEGAL ON JANUARY 1ST.
Stephen: IS IT GOING TO BE TAXED?
HEAVILY, YES. SO IF YOU BUY MEDICAL MARIJUANA, IT IS ABOUT A FIVE PERCENT TAX AND NEW RETAIL MARIJUANA WILL BE A 25 PERCENT TAX, WHICH INCLUDES --
Stephen: 25?  A 25 PERCENT TAX ON A DOOBAJ?
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT, IS IT NOT WORTH IT, STEPHEN?
Stephen: IT IS MORE TAX THAN TOKE LIBERALISM IN MY OPINION, WHY DON'T YOU JUST MAKE IT 85 PERCENT AND GIVE ME YOUR CAR WHEN YOU ARE HIGH. THEY WILL NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. TAKE IT!
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE IS DEFINITELY GOING TOWARD THE BUILDING OF SCHOOLS, I BELIEVE IT IS THE FIRST 40 MILLION RAISED FROM RECREATIONAL SALES.
Stephen: WHAT WERE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE POT EDITOR FOR THE DENVER POST BE?
I AM HIRING A POT CRITIC FROM COLORADO, IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW A FEW PEOPLE BUT I NEED THEM IN MY EDITING ROOM.
YOU CERTAINLY WANT A REVIEWER, YOU WANT A CRITIC OF POT.
YES.
Stephen: ANYBODY YOU LIKE?
I GOT ONE VIA TWITTER.
Stephen:.
Stephen: DUDE, I AM BAKED OUT OF MY SKULL.
YOU WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED.
Stephen: IT GIVES KIDS AN EXCUSE ALL OVER THE NATION WHO GET CAUGHT SMOKING POT THEY CAN JUST TELL THEIR PARENTS, MOM, I AM PREPARING FOR A CAREER IN JOURNALISM.
WE ARE NOT ENCOURAGING THAT, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
Stephen: WHAT IF THEY HAVE A FRIEND THAT GOES TO VACATION TO COLORADO AND HOW MUCH CAN YOU BUY.
IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT YOU CAN BUY AN OUNCE A DAY AND IF YOU DON'T, YOU CAN BUY UP TO A QUARTER OUNCE PER DAY.
Stephen: THAT'S A LOT OF POT!  A QUARTER OUNCE A DAY?
IT IS A LOT OF POT.
Stephen: WHAT CONFUSES ME MOST IS IF EVERYBODY IN THE STATE CAN HAVE A QUARTER OUNCE OF POT IN THEIR POCKET HOW WILL YOU INDISCRIMINATELY ARREST YOUNG BLACK MEN?  ON WHAT GROUNDS WILL YOU IMPRISON THEM?
IF YOU ARE A CITIZEN OF COLORADO YOU CAN HAVE A QUARTER OUNCE, BUT UP TO TWO OUNCES FOR MEDICAL.
Stephen: WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE ARRESTS. IF SOMEONE DID GET ARRESTED AND IS IN JAIL NOW FOR POT POSSESSION IN COLORADO, ON JANUARY 1ST WHEN IT BECOMES LEGAL DO THEY GET TO GET OUT OF JAIL?
I DON'T BELIEVE SO. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.
Stephen: CAN WE AT LEAST BRING THEM POT IN JAIL TO MAKE IT A BETTER EXPERIENCE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING. MAYBE THE STATE IS PLANNING ON DOING THAT.  I AM NOT SURE. I DOUBT IT THOUGH.
Stephen: A POLITICIANS WHO CAMPAIGN IN COLORADO WILL HAVE TO STOP BY THE STATE FAIR AND JUDGE THE TASTIEST BUD.
THEY WILL HAVE LIKE A --
VOTE FOR ME!  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, RICARDO BACA, THE DENVER POST MARIJUANA EDITOR. WE WILL
