["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AN   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. PLEASE, NATION, SIT DOWN. AS AN AMERICAN I DON'T LIKE TO  TALK ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES THAT  ARE NOT US. WITH THEIR CRAZY NAMES --  "NOTAMERICA-STAN." [LAUGHTER] BUT TONIGHT, EVERY SINGLE STORY  I WILL BE REPORTING ON COMES  FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY. I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT EITHER. BLAME THE U.N. [LAUGHTER] FIRST UP, A STORY THAT IS  ROCKING THEWORLD OF MEAT.
THE UNITED KINGDOM'S MEAT  INDUSTRY IS IN DISARRAY AFTER  HORSE MEAT WAS DISCOVERED IN PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR HUMANS.
FOOD GIANT NESTLE SUSPENDING  SOME OF ITS DELIVERIES AFTER  TRACES OF HORSE DNA WERE FOUND IN THE MEAT.
STORES IN BRITAIN, FRANCE AND  SWEDEN NOW YANKING BEEF PRODUCTS  OFF THE SHELVES OVER A HORSE MEAT SCARE.
BURGER KING ADMITS SOME OF  ITS PATTIES IN ENGLAND AND  IRELAND WERE TAINTED WITH HORSE MEAT.
Stephen: SOMEONE IN EUROPE IS  TRYING TO SLIP YOU THEIR TAINTED  MEAT, AND FOR ONCE IT'S NOT SILVIO BURLESCONI. [LAUGHTER] HE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO YANK HIS  MEAT OFF THE SHELVES:  4R5 H- [LAUGHTER] NOW, EVERYONE IN EUROPE IS  WORRIED THAT THEY MAY BE BITING  DOWN ON HORSE, INSTEAD OF THEIR USUAL DELICACY OF PICKLED SHEEP  BRAIN. [LAUGHTER] IT'S A COMPLEX STORY, SO LET ME  BACK UP AND EXPLAIN HOW THIS  HORSE SCANDAL WENT DOWN. [SPEAKING LIKE A RACETRACK  ANNOUNCER] AND THEY'RE OFF -- FIRST, HORSE  MEAT WAS DISCOVERED IN A BRITISH  SUPERMARKET, BUT BRITAIN ROUNDED THE BEND AND LAID THE BLAME ON  THE IRISH SUPPLIER-- WHO SAID  THEY GOT IT FROM POLAND. POLAND DENIES IT. AAAANNND HERE'S FRANCE, COMING  UP STRONG WITH THEIR OWN HORSE  MEAT SCANDAL, SELLING MEAT TO ENGLAND AND SWEDEN, BUT FRANCE  FALLS BEHIND AND LAYS THE BLAME  ON CYPRUS. CYPRUS NOW IN THE LEAD WITH THE  BLAME, BUT WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? OUT OF NOWHERE ON THE LAST LEG,  CYPRUS SAYS THEY GOT THEIR MEAT  FROM A DUTCH COMPANY, WHO SAID THEY GOT IT FROM-- WHO'S THAT? WHO'S THAT? IT'S ROMANIA! ROMANIA TAKES THE BLAME!!! [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THE ROMANIANS DID NOT ACT  ALONE.
I'VE GOT A HORRIBLE FEELING  WE'RE LOOKING AT A MAJOR  INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL  CONSPIRACY.
CLAIMS THAT ORGANIZED CRIME  GANGS ARE BEHIND THE  CONTAMINATION ARE THREATENING TO ERRODE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE.
Stephen: ORGANIZED CRIME! [LAUGHTER] I'M NOT SURPRISED THE MOB IS  INVOLVED. I MEAN, IF YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE A  HORSE HEAD IN A BED, WHY WASTE  ALL THAT GOOD BODY MEAT? [LAUGHTER] FRANKLY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY  EVERYONE IS SO UPSET OVER EATING  HORSE? WE DON'T FEEL GUILTY WHEN WE  HAPPILY CONSUME THE REST OF  NOAH'S ARK? [LAUGHTER] IS IT BECAUSE THEY'RE OUR  FRIENDS IN MOVIES AND TV SHOWS? WELL, I LOVE BACON, SO I JUST  HOPE SPIELBERG NEVER MAKES "WAR  PIG." [LAUGHTER] THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH  EATING HORSE BURGERS. FAST FOOD SHOULD BE MADE OF FAST  ANIMALS. OH MAN, I COULD REALLY GO FOR A  DOUBLE-CHEETAH MELT [LAUGHTER] NATION, NEXT UP ON NOT AMERICA,  FOOTBALL IS GETTING A LOT OF  HEAT ABOUT TRAUMATIC BRAIN  INJURIES. I DON'T SEE WHAT THE BIG DEAL  IS. I PLAYED AS A KID AND I'M PURPLY  SPATULA. [LAUGHTER] BUT THAT HASN'T STOPPED  PRESIDENT OBAMA FROM PILING ON,  TELLING THE NEW REPUBLIC, "IF I HAD A SON, I'D HAVE TO THINK  LONG AND HARD BEFORE I LET HIM  PLAY FOOTBALL."  OH, REALLY, SIR? WELL FOOTBALL DOESN'T WANT YOUR  IMAGERY SON BECAUSE HE THROWS  LIKE AN IMAGERY GIRL. [ LAUGHTER ] SADLY, THE SPECTRE OF CHILDHOOD  BRAIN DAMAGE THREATENS THE  FUTURE OF FOOTBALL. SO CLEARLY, WE HAVE TO  IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS THIS CRISIS  BY TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. THIS IS "THE SPORT REPORT." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HUMMING] [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, I'M NO FAN BUT SOCCER IS  EUROPE'S MOST POPULAR SPORT,  RIGHT BEHIND COMPETITIVE  THREE-WAYS. [LAUGHTER] INCREDIBLE BALL HANDLING. [LAUGHTER] BUT NOW THERE'S A DARK CLOUD ON  SOCCER'S HORIZON.
HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL  SOCCER MATCHES MAY HAVE BEEN  FIXED.
WE'RE TALKING WORLD CUP  QUALIFIERS, EUROPEAN  CHAMPIONSHIPS QUALIFIERS. THESE TOURNAMENTS DON'T COME ANY  BIGGER AND MORE PRESTIGIOUS THAN  THIS.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 680  SUSPICIOUS GAMES INVOLVING 425  MATCH OFFICIALS, CLUB OFFICIALS, PLAYERS, KNOWN CRIMINALS FROM  SOME 15 COUNTRIES AROUND THE  WORLD. I MEAN THIS IS ABSOLUTELY  MASSIVE.
Stephen: I'M SHOCKED. [LAUGHTER] WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THERE WAS  ANYTHING FAKE ABOUT SOCCER? IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A GAME OF SUCH  INTEGRITY. [LAUGHTER] NOW, THIS GAME-FIXING STARTED  OUT SUBTLY, BUT AUTHORITIES  BEGAN TO SUSPECT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WHEN INSTEAD OF RED AND  YELLOW CARDS, REFEREES BEGAN  HOLDING PLATINUM CARDS. AND THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED  SCANDAL. RUSSIAN MOBSTERS "HAVE TARGETED  EVERY LEVEL OF THE GAME. THE WORLD CUP ALL THE WAY DOWN  TO SEMIPRO GAMES IN THE SOCCER  WILDERNESS. SO, THE NEXT TIME YOU DROP OFF  KATIE AT HER MATCH AGAINST THE  McKINLEY TITANS, WATCH OUT FOR A GUY WITH A RUSSIAN ACCENT AND A  BRIEFCASE FULL OF ORANGE SLICES. [LAUGHTER] THE MATCH FIXING EVEN WENT ON IN  THE CROWN JEWEL OF EUROPEAN  SOCCER, THE U-AYFA CHAMPIONS -- IF THAT'S HOW YOU SAY IT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE U-AYFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE. IN A GAME AGAINST LIVERPOOL, A  HUNGARIAN TEAM'S GOALKEEPER WAS,  PAID TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN TWO GOALS SCORED IN  THE MATCH. BUT LIVERPOOL WON BY THE SCORE  OF ONE TO ZERO. WHICH GOES TO SHOW, NO ONE MAN  CAN BE MORE CORRUPT THAN SOCCER  IS BORING. [LAUGHTER] AND THE FIXERS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE FIXERS ALSO PAID OFF  REFEREES, OFTEN IN SUBTLE WAYS. LIKE WHEN ALL SEVEN GOALS IN TWO  MATCHES CAME FROM PENALTY KICKS  AWARDED BY REFEREES, OR A LATVIAN GAME WHERE AFTER A  PLAYER MISSED A PENALTY KICK,  THE REFEREE ORDERED THAT IT BE  RETAKEN. THIS TIME FROM INSIDE THE GOAL. [LAUGHTER] SO WILL CORRUPTION DESTROY  SOCCER? HERE TO MOVE THE DISCUSSION  FORWARD WITHOUT USING HIS HANDS,  PLEASE WELCOME FORMER U.S. NATIONAL TEAM MEMBER AND ESPN  SOCCER ANALYST, ALEXEI LALAS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT ALEXI, GOOD TO HAVE  YOU BACK, THIS IS THIS IT FOR  SOCKER IS? IS IT A KILLING BLOW TO THE  WORLD'S MOST FAVORITE SPORT?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
Stephen: WHY NOT IT'S  CORRUPT YOU CAN'T TRUST A SINGLE  GAME. IT'S A SHAM. IT'S THEATER. IT MIGHT AS WELL BE WRESTLING AT  THIS POINT.
IT'S IN THE A SHAM. IT'S HUGE AND VERY IMPORTANT.
Stephen: SO IS WRESTLING.
IT'S IMPORTANT IT BE DEALT  WITH. WHEN THESE THINGS COME OUT. FIXING HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A  LONG TIME BUT WE'RE TALKING IN  EUROPE, CENTRAL AMERICA AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MASSIVE  AMOUNT OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE  UNITED STATES DO WE HAVE  EVIDENCE OF FIXING IN THE UNITED  STATES?
WE HAVE SOME EVIDENCE BUT I'M  HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE U.S. MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER IS CLEAN AND  MAYBE IN THAT SENSE THERE'S AN  OPPORTUNITY THERE.
Stephen: HOW WOULD SOMEBODY  FIX A GAME? HOW?
I GUARANTEE I'VE PLAYED IN A  FIXED GAME. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  MING IN IT AND FIXING A GAME. YOU DON'T NEED A LOT TO DO IT. IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE REFEREE. IT'S PLAYERS, PLAYERS ON THE  FIELD AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A  FIXER, A GUY WITH RELATIONSHIP WITH PLAYERS, AN E-PLAYER, A GUY  WHO IS BITTER, NOT MAKING A LOT  OF MONEY. A REFEREE OR MERES MAKING A  COUPLE HOW TO AND SAY HEY, YOU  CAN MAKE $50,000 IT'S DIFFICULT TO PASS UP.
Stephen: WHO IS POLICING? FIFA?
THEY CAN DO ONLY SO MUCH. THEY NEED THE HELP OF THE POLICE  IN THE COUNTRIES. THIS IS ALL ALWAYS WE TALK ABOUT  ASIA AND SINGAPORE WHICH VERY  IMPORTANT.
Stephen: ONE GUY IN  SINGAPORE.
GOTTA GET HIM.
Stephen: HE'S FIXING GAMES  ALL OVER THE WORLD.
THERE'S AN INTERNATIONAL  ARREST WARRANT FOR HIM NEXT  SUMMER IS THE WORLD CUP AND GOD FORBID WE'RE LOOKING AT THE  WORLD CUP NEXT SUMMER SAYING AH. ONCE YOU ARE TAINTED IT'S  DIFFICULT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MAJOR LEAGUE  SOCCER IN THE UNITED STATES,  THEY ARE VIGILANT ABOUT. THIS THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE IT  DOESN'T CREEP TO THE U.S.
Stephen: CAN YOU TRUST  ANYTHING ABOUT A GAME WHERE  PLAYERS ARE ROUTINELY SLAPPING EACH OTHER IN THE FACE WITH  OTHER PEOPLE'S HANDS.
DON'T BE A BOOB, STEVE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN  DON'T BE A BOOB. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. OH, OW! NO ONE GOING TO CALL THAT? LISTEN, I DON'T HATE YOU BECAUSE  YOU HAVE THAT VIEW OF SOCCER I  PITY YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BEAUTIFUL GAME  IT'S NUANCE. IT'S SUBJECTIVE. IT TAKES SUPERIOR INTELLECT TO  UNDERSTAND THE BEAUTY OF GAME  EVEN THE THEATRICS WE SEE OUT  THERE. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT'S  OKAY. I AM NOT ABLE TO CONVINCE YOU [AUDIENCE REACTS [.
Stephen: IT'S FINE. MAYBE SOME GUY WILL UNDERSTAND  THE JOY. YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND IT.
Stephen:LY NEVER RISE TO  THE LEVEL OF APPRECIATING 0-0  THE EXCITEMENT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
Stephen: ESPN
