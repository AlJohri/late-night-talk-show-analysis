WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE AS A WEALTH AMERICAN I'M CONSTANTLY BESEIGED BY LEGIONS OF MOOFERNERS WHO WANT A PIECE OF THE PIE. I SAY BACK OFF. IF I GOT ANY EXTRA PIE I'M FEEDING IT TO THE BIRDS BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET ALL MAD WHEN I MAKE THEM SING FOR IT. THIS IS COLBERT PLATINUM. QUICK REMINDER, FOLKS, THIS SEGMENT IS FOR PLATINUM MEMBERS ONLY. IF YOU ARE'S NOT WATCHING THIS ON A HOVER FLAT SCREEN TRIMMED WITH UNBORN LEOPARD PELT WHY DON'T YOU SCAMPER OFF TO T.G.I. FRIDAYS, TELL THEM IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY, MAYBE GET A FREE MUDSLIDE. ALL RIGHT, PLATINUM NATION, WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW WAYS TO ESCAPE THE BIG GOVERNMENT TAX MACHINE SO AS MUCH AS I LOVE THIS COUNTRY, I CANNOT WAIT TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE AND ON TO A KICK ASS BOAT.
DRIFTING AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD, WE NOW HAVE THE FREEDOM CHIP, THE ONE MILE LONG 25 STORY TALL MEGASHIP THAT IS MORE LIKE A FLOATING CITY THAN A BOAT. IT WOULD CARRY UP TO 50,000 FULL-TIME RESIDENTS. UNCLEAR HOW TAXES WOULD WORK FOR PEOPLE THERE BUT THEY SAID IT WILL NOT BE REGISTERED IN THE UNITED STATES. SO UNCLE SAM WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO PEOPLE ON THAT BOAT.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THE FREEDOM SHIP WITH ALL THE SLICK DESIGN OF AN UNFINISHED PARKING GARAGE. AND EVERYTHING THE STATELESS BILLIONAIRE TYCOON NEEDS TO FEEL AT HOME. BANKS, CASINOS, AND A 1.7 MILLION SQUARE FOOT INTERNATIONAL SHOPPING MALL. IMAGINE, AN ENORMOUS MALL YOU NEVER HAVE TO LEAVE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. IT'S UP TO YOU, ANOTHER ORANGE JULIUS OR A WATERY GRAVE. AND AS FOR ACCOMMODATIONS, FREEDOM SHIP OFFERS THE ULTIMATE IN HIGH NET WORTH REAL ESTATE. FOR AS LITTLE AS 9.1 MILLION YOU CAN RESERVE A WATER VIEW ULTIMATE APEX ROOM BOASTING SUCH LUXURY AMENITIES AS CARPETS, LIGHTS, AND FINISHED WALLS. WHAT? FINISHED WALLS! THAT'S LIKE THE HOT TUB OF BLOCKING WIND. (LAUGHTER) FREEDOM SHIP IS ALSO FOR YOUR FREEDOM CHILDREN WHO WILL RECEIVE THE FINEST SCHOOLING THAT UNDERPAID FILL PYNNO DECK HANDS CAN PROVIDE. AS PART OF A WORLD STANDARD SYSTEM OF SCHOOLS, FINANCIAL EDUCATION WILL BE STRESSED AS EACH AND EVERY CHILD IS EXPOSED ON A DAILY BASIS TO INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE ABOARD THE SHIP. YES, STUDENTS WILL LEARN IMPORTANT BUSINESS CONCEPTS LIKE NEGOTIATION, CRISIS MANAGEMENT, ESPECIALLY ONCE YOU'RE BOARDED BY THE SOMALI PIRATES. THE WAY I SEE IT, FOLKS, THERE ARE ONLY TWO THINGS FROM PREVENTING ME FROM BOARDING TOMORROW. ONE, FREEDOM SHIP HAS NOT YET BEEN BUILT. SO IT'S A LITTLE EARLY TO MEASURE THE DRAPES FOR MY LUXURIOUS FINISHED WALLS. TWO, BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION, FREEDOM SHIP WILL BE SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL MARITIME LAW. SORRY. THAT'S TOO MUCH LAW FOR THIS GUY. EVEN IF IT DOES ALLOW ME TO GAMBLE ON WHITE RHINO AND THEN SNORT THE LOSER. SO I HAVE, OH WAY, IT WORKS. THE LEDGE ENS ARE TRUE. OKAY. SO I HAVE DEVICED MY OWN ESCAPE FOR BILLIONAIRE EX-PATS. STEPHEN COLBERT'S LIBERTY DERIDGEABLE. FINALLY A PLACE WHERE AMERICA'S WEALTHY CAN TAKE TO THE SKIES, SHATTER THE CHAINS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND FIND THEIR OWN DESTINY AS LONG AS IT IS DOWNWIND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
