LET'S GET A LITTLE BIT OF APPLAUSE FOR THAT (APPLAUSE)
WHATEVER!
Stephen: YOU WORKED FOR THE 60 MINUTES, YOU WERE ONE OF THE ORIGINAL HOSTS OF "THE VIEW," CO-ANCHORED THE "TODAY   SHOW," ALSO HOSTED "WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE" FOR 11 SEASONS  AND HAVE A NEW DAYTIME SHOW CALLED THE MEREDITH VIERA SHOW. GO FIGURE! DOESN'T IT FEEL GOOD TO HAVE A SHOW WITH YOUR NAME PLASTERED  EVERYWHERE?
IT IS TERRIFYING. BECAUSE IT'S MY NAME
Stephen: OF COURSE! WHO SHOULD WE NAME IT AFTER?
I SAID KATIE COURIC, THEY SAID NO. THEY SAID, YOU HAVE TO BE MEREDITH VIERA. DON'T YOU FEEL THAT?
Stephen: FEEL GREAT? THE WEIGHT OF THE NAME ON YOUR SHOW. HOW LARGE IS YOUR STAFF?
Stephen: ABOUT 1,500. SO YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD.
Stephen: I AM. I AM A RIVER UNTO MY PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) SO THAT'S GOOD. THEY'RE ON YOUR MAGIC CARPET RIDE?
YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S HEADED.
DON'T LAND AT LA GUARDIA. NO.
Stephen: A NIGHTMARE. HAVE YOU BEEN SCARED OF EBOLA, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: TERRIFIED. DO YOU HAVE EBOLA?
INTERESTING ENOUGH, I HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH DR BESSER WHO WAS UNDER VOLUNTARY QUARANTINE BUT HE SNEEZED AND SHOOK MY HAND AND I WAS TOO POLITE TO NOT SHAKE IT, THEN I WAS TERRIFIED.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE TOO POLITE TO NOT POSSIBLY DIE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: OF HEMORRHAGIC FEVER. KISS ME, DARLING! KISS ME!
OKAY, SO -- HE'S FINE, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: THEY DON'T CARE.
Stephen: I'LL SEE YA AROUND. (LAUGHTER) NOW, HERE'S THE THING I LIKE ABOUT YOU, YOU'RE VERY LIKABLE AND RELATABLE --
AWWW!
Stephen: NOW, DO I LIKE -- YOU? (LAUGHTER) AM I RELATING TO YOU OR IS THIS JUST THE MEREDITH VIEIRA WE SEE ON TV? IN REALTY, ARE YOU A LIKABLE, RELATABLE PERSON, OR RIGHT NOW AM I ALSO GETTING THE TV MEREDITH VIERIA BECAUSE WE ARE, IN FACT, ON TV?
NO, NO. I AM WHO I AM.
Stephen: REALLY? YES, REALLY. UNLIKE --
Stephen: UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW? (LAUGHTER) I'M ME, BABY! THIS IS ME! YOU CAN CUT ME OPEN AND COUNT THE RINGS OF STEPHEN COLBERT!
OH, MY GOSH!
Stephen: THE ONLY REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO BLURT THINGS OUT.
YES.
Stephen: VERY HONESTLY LIKE ON THE VIEW.
LIKE WHAT DID I SAY.
Stephen: YOU SAID -- LIKE WHAT?
Stephen: YOU SAID, I DON'T WEAR UNDERWEAR.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHY IS I BELIEVE WHY THEY CALL IT THE VIEW WHAT POSSESSED YOU TO BE THAT REVEALING?
BECAUSE IT'S A DAYTIME SHOW AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AUTHENTIC AND I JUST FELT, WHY NOT? WHY NOT SHARE THAT WITH AMERICA?
Stephen: AND LATER DID ANYONE DESCRIBE TO YOU WHY NOT? PERHAPS YOUR FAMILY? PERHAPS YOUR CHILDREN?
I DON'T THINK MY CHILDREN SAW THAT PARTICULAR SHOW.
Stephen: THEY DON'T WATCH THIS, I HOPE.
MY KIDS ARE BIG FANS, ACTUALLY.
Stephen: JIMMY, LET'S EDIT THAT OUT, THEN.
DO YOU WEAR UNDERWEAR?
Stephen: HELL NO. WELL, OKAY, THEN! I REST MY CASE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: UNDERWEAR HAS NOT BEEN WOVEN THAT COULD CONTAIN MY BALLS. IT'S JUST KINDLING. (LAUGHTER) THE ONLY HONESTY YOU HAVE ON YOUR NEW SET, ON THE MEREDITH VIERA SHOW, IS THAT IT'S FURNITURE THAT'S NOT IN GREAT SHAPE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO BE AS PRETTY AS POSSIBLE?
BECAUSE IT'S MY REAL FURNITURE, ONE OF THE CHAIRS, AND IT'S TORN TO SHREDS BY MY CATS, FELIPE NOIR AND SWEET PEA AND THEY RUINED THE CHAIR AND I WANTED PEOPLE TO SEE THIS IS  THE WAY WE LIVE. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE THAT WAY. I THOUGHT THE CHAIR WOULD BE AUTHENTIC.
Stephen: IT DOES SOUND AUTHENTIC. NOW,  YOU GOT TO REPLACE THAT CHAIR AT HOME AND THAT'S A TAX DEDUCTION NOW (LAUGHTER) EXPECT AN AUDIT ANY MINUTE. IS YOUR SET LIKE YOUR LIVING ROOM AT HOME?
WELL, IT'S SORT OF LIKE IT.
Stephen: BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE MY LIVING ROOM.
I BET IT IS.
Stephen: THIS IS MY SHOE CLOSET.
IS THAT YOUR REAL EMMY?
Stephen: THIS IS ONE OF THEM.
ONE OF HOW MANY?
Stephen: YOU HAVE 14, DON'T ACT LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE A  LOT OF EMMYS
I DO.
Stephen: I HAVE 10. YOU HAVE 10?
Stephen: YEAH. WOW! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SOMETIMES I PUT THEM IN A PIT AND MAKE THEM FIGHT MY FOUR PEABODYS.   HOW MANY PEABODYS DO YOU HAVE?
I DON'T HAVE A PEABODY. MY HUSBAND HAS A PEABODY HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE?
Stephen: I HAVE FOUR. I HAVE FOUR PEABODYS HOW MANY GRAMMYS DO YOU HAVE?

Stephen: YEAH! AND I'M NOT WEARING UNDERWEAR. I HAVE TWO GRAMMYS.
