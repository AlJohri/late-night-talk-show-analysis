YOU REALLY CAN'T BLAME THEM. THAT HELICOPTER WAS $5. ( LAUGHTER ) AND EACH YEAR, BLACK FRIDAY GETS A LITTLE BIT BLACKER AND A LITTLE LESS FRIDAY.
RETAILERS ARE STUMBLING OVER EACH OTHER TO ANNOUNCE JUST HOW EARLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE OPENING ON THE HOLIDAY THIS YEAR. JUST THIS MORNING J.C. PENNY ANNOUNCING IT WILL  OPEN AT 5:00PM, THAT'S 3 HOURS EARLIER THAN IT OPENED LAST YEAR. MACY'S, KOHLS AND SEARS WILL BE OPEN AT 6:00 P.M. ON THANKSGIVING DAY. ONE RETAILER TAKES THE CAKE-- K-MART OPENING AT 6:00 A.M. ON THANKSGIVING MORNING.
RETAIL EXPERTS CALL IT THE "CHRISTMAS CREEP," THAT SENSE THAT THE HOLIDAYS ARE COMING EARLIER AND EARLIER.
Stephen: YES, THE CHRISTMAS CREEP, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE MALL SANTA WHO WANTS YOU TO SIT ON HIS LAP JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER. FOLKS, SOME RETAIL GRINCHES WANT TO DESTROY THIS HOLIDAY BY LETTING THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE A HOLIDAY.
COSTCO ANNOUNCED ALL OF ITS 468 STORES WILL BE CLOSED ON THANKSGIVING.
COSTCO TAKE A STAND AND REALLY BUCKING THE TREND HERE, SAYING THEIR WORKERS DESERVE A HOLIDAY, DECLARING THANKSGIVING IS FOR FAMILIES, AND THE WORKERS SHOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY.

GAME STOP IS JOINING COSTCO, CLOSING UP SHOP ON THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR.
Stephen: WHAT! WHAT! ON THANKSGIVING? ALL OF MY FAVORITE STORES ARE CLOSING? AND RADIO SHACK? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, NO-- NO RADIO SHACK? NOW WHERE AM I GOING TO GET MY THREE-PRONGED TURKEY-TO-YAM ADAPTOR. I AM TAKING A STAND RIGHT NOW. THEY CANNOT DO THIS TO MY BLACK FRIDAY. IT IS A CHERISHED POST-THANKSGIVING TRADITION THAT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE ORIGINAL THANKSGIVING WHEN THE PILGRIMS KNOCKED THE INDIANS TO THE GROUND SO THEY COULD BE THE FIRST TO GET TO THE DISCOUNT BUCKLE HATS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
