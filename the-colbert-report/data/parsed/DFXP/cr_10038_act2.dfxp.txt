Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, I HOPE YOU CHECKED YOUR CALENDARS. THERE ARE ONLY 7 SHOPPING DAYS LEFT UNTIL CHRISTMAS. REMEMBER IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO GET YOUR KIDS THE PRESENTS OF THEIR DREAMS.
TED CRUZ IS FEATURED IN A NEW COLOR BOOK "TED CRUZ TO THE FUTURE."
THE COLOR BOOK SAYS THE CRUZ TO THE FUTURE IS NOT A ENDORSEMENT BUT AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL. THE PUBLISHER SAYS IT'S A NON PARTISAN STAT DRIVEN VIEW ON HOW CRUZ BECAME A SENATOR.
Stephen: A COLOR BOOK ABOUT TED CRUZ IS THE NUMBER ONE BOOK ON AMAZON'S LIST OF CHILDREN'S COLORING BOOKS. I KNOW IT MAKES ME HAPPY TOO. PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THE TED CRUZ COLORING BOOK ALSO BROUGHT A KAY OLE A 64 PACK OF WHITE CRAYONS AND THIS COLORING BOOK, THIS COLORING BOOK -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: -- HAS EVERYTHING KIDS LOVE FROM TONS OF FUN TEXT TO MENTIONS OF PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTIONS. I'M NOT SURPRISED REALLY BIG COLORING BOOKS PUBLIC THIS, THEY'RE THE SAME PATRIOTS THAT BROUGHT THE KIDS THE TEA PARTY COLORING BOOK FOR KIDS AND THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY MINIMUM FREEDOM AND MAXIMUM WITH JOHN STOSSEL ON THE COVERAGE. YOU CAN COLOR IN HIS MUSTACHE, KIDS, LIKE JOHN STOSSEL DOES. THE INSIDE COVER STATES IT'S A FARE AND OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF THIS REAL LIFE SUPERHERO. LIKE THEIR TRIBUTE TO TED CRUZ 24-HOUR OBAMA CARE FILIBUSTER. THEY SAY CRUZ IS CLAIRVOYANT AND AMERICANS BELIEVE OBAMA CARE IS LESS THAN ANY WAR. AT LEAST AMERICAN SOLDIERS HAVE WEAPONS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. SO TRUE, WHY AREN'T AMERICANS ALLOWED TO SHOOT THEIR DOCTORS ANYMORE. PLUS THIS BOOK HAS FUN ACTIVITIES LIKE CONNECT THE DOTS. I AM ONLY HALF WAY THROUGH. I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S A T-REX. SO REALLY BIG COLORING BOOKS, GREAT JOB. I HOPE YOU CREATE MORE CONSERVATIVE THEME KIDS ACTIVITIES AND THEMES. LIKE CONNECT HILLARY TO BEN
