(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, , THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US! NATION, IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE NEWS, YOU KNOW THAT THE SOCHI OLYMPIC GAMES ARE IN FULL SWING AND EVERYBODY HAS GOT OLYMPIC FEVER. ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT JUST BE THE POISONOUS HOTEL WATER. NOW I SPENT ALL WEEKEND WATCHING FIGURE SKATING. I LOVE ALL THE MOVES, THE TRIPLE SALCHOW, THE DOUBLE AXLE, THE SHOELESS JOE JACKSON, ALL OF THEM. FRIDAY, MY FRIEND, VLADIMIR PUTIN'S GAMES KICKED OFF WITH A STUNNING OPENING CEREMONY, IT WENT THROUGH ALL OF RUSSIAN HISTORY INCLUDING THE GIANT CAT INVASION. I GOT TO SAY, I ONLY HAD ONE CRITICISM. YOU DO THE HISTORY OF RUSSIA AND NO GIANT INFLATABLE REAGAN KNOCKING DOWN A BERLIN WALL. COME ON. BUT NO SURPRISE, FOLKS. THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAD TO FIND THE PROBLEM.
THE MOST GLARING SNAFU CAME DURING THE SHOWCASE MOMENT OF THE OPENING CEREMONY, THOSE FIVE DESCENDING SNOW FLAKES WERE SUPPOSED IT TO MELD INTO OLYMPIC RINGS. BUT THE FIFTH ONE ON THE RIGHT MALFUNCTIONED.
Stephen: NO, IT DID NOT MALFUNCTION. IT IS JUST THAT THE IOC IS SO LITIGIOUS THAT EVEN THE OLYMPICS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SHOW THE OLYMPIC LOGO. (LAUGHTER) AND CHECK YOUR FACTS--  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: CHECK YOUR FACTS, EVERYBODY, THAT'S A FACT. IN WRITING.
THESE SPOILED JOURNALISTS NEED TO QUIT TALKING ABOUT THE U.S. BOBSLEDDER WHO GOT STUCK IN THE HOTEL BATHROOM AND HAD TO BREAK THROUGH THE DOOR. OKAY, THAT'S JUST BONUS STRENGTH TRAINING. (LAUGHTER) NOW OUR GUYS WILL BE PREPARED TO BUST THROUGH ANY DOORS ON THE BOBSLED TRACK. (LAUGHTER) ALL OLYMPICS HAVE LAST MINUTE CONSTRUCTION ISSUES. ON THE PLUS SIDE, THIS YEAR'S BIATHELON COMBINED CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING WITH HANGING DRYWALL. THAT'S A FIRST. (LAUGHTER) BUT NATION, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ONLY THE MEDIA ATTACKING THESE OLYMPIC GAMES. THEY'RE ALSO UNDER THREAT FROM EXTREMIST TERROR GROUP THE GAYS. (LAUGHTER) NOW LAST YEAR PRESIDENT PUTIN TOOK A HARD LINE AGAINST THIS THREAT BY BANNING ALL GAY PROPAGANDA. PROTESTORS CAN NOW FACE JAIL TIME PROMOTING ANYTHING PRO GAY FROM A PRIDE FLAG TO A RECLAIMED BARN WOOD COFFEE TABLE. (LAUGHTER) BIG SURPRISE, THE GAYS AREN'T TAKING THIS LYING DOWN, OR MAYBE THEY ARE, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S NOT MY SCENE. (LAUGHTER) NOW, NOW THEY ARE THREATENING TO RUIN THE SOCHI GAMES.
GAY RIGHTS PROTESTORS RALLIED IN 20 CITIES AGAINST RUSSIA'S ANTI-GAY LAW, THEY WANT OLYMPIC SPONSORS TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST RUSSIA LAWS THAT RESTRICT GAY RIGHTS ACTIVITY.
NEW YORK, YOU HAD A NUMBER OF GAY ACT VISES PROTESTING OUTSIDE THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE UPSET WITH THE ANTI-GAY LAWS IN RUSSIA AND THEY POURED A RED LIQUID LABLED VAMPIRE BLOOD TO MAKE THEIR POINT.
Stephen: UNFORTUNATELY NO ONE COULD TELL WHAT THAT POINT WAS. (LAUGHTER) SOMETHING ABOUT TRUE BLOOD BEING CANCELLED? I DON'T--  (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, IN SUPPORT OF AL-GAYDA PRESIDENT OBAMA NAMED THREE OPENLY GAY ATHLETES TO LEAD OUR OLYMPIC DELEGATION WHICH THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN GLOATED WAS A FINGER IN THE EYE OF RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN, A FINGER IN THE EYE. OR AS LESBIANS CALL IT, SCISSORING. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, OH YEAH, OH NO, IT'S UGLY BUSINESS. OF COURSE, FOUR YEARS AGO I SAVED THE WINTER GAMES WHEN I SPONSORED THE U.S. SPEED SKATING TEAM AND DID A WEEK OF SHOWS FROM VANCOUVER. WELL, NATION, I AM GOING BACK TO THE OLYMPICS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IS SOMETHING I WOULD SAY IF THEY WEREN'T IN RUSSIA. (LAUGHTER) I CAN'T DO THAT. I CAN'T DO THAT. I CAN'T LEARN RUSSIAN. IT WAS HARD ENOUGH LEARNING CANADIAN. I MEAN, TORE-ON-TO. TORE-ON-TO. IT'S A TONAL LANGUAGE. I JUST CAN'T MASTER IT. BUT FOLKS, I DO KNOW ONE MAN WHO CAN COVER THIS GAY THREAT LIKE NO ONE ELSE, PLEASE WELCOME MY OLD FRIEND AND LONG TIME COLBERT REPORT PRODUCER, BUDDY COLE. BUDDY, GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND.
GREAT TO BE HERE, STEPHEN.
Stephen: NOW BUDDY, FOLKS, FOR THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW, BUDDY AND I GO WAY BACK. WE MET AT THEATRE CAMP WHERE HE HAD AN ALMOST AMAZING GAYDAR. IF YOU WERE GAY, BUDDY WOULD SMOKE YOU OUT.
IT'S TRUE. I COVERED-- UNCOVERED EVERY SINGLE GAY MAN IN CAMP, WELL, EXCEPT FOR ONE.
Stephen: WELL, YOU'LL GET HIM ONE DAY.
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.
Stephen: NOW BUDDY, I NEED YOU TO GO TO RUSSIA TO INVESTIGATE THE GAY THREAT TO THE GAMES. ARE YOU UP FOR IT?
YES, SIR.
YOU SAY GAY AND ATHLETES, AND I'M THERE.
Stephen: GOOD MAN, BUT HERE IS THE THING, THESE ANTIGAY PROPAGANDA LAWS ARE SO VAGUE. JUST PLEASE DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT COULD MAKE THE RUSSIAN POLICE MISTAKE YOU FOR A GAY GUY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME, STEPHEN. I RECENTLY LEARNED ALL ABOUT HOW TO STAY SAFE IN RUSSIA. FROM U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE, DAN BAER, JIM?
Stephen: ACTUALLY, BUDDY, I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN SAY JIM.
OKAY. STEPHEN?
Stephen: JIM. (LAUGHTER) WITHIN "THE COLBERT REPORT" PRESENTS A REPORT EXCLUSIVE FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.
BUT NO GAY STUFF.
DOUBLE O 14.
WITH ME, BUDDY COLE.
BEFORE HEADING TO SOCHI, I NEEDED TO LEARN ABOUT RUSSIA'S ANTI-GAY LAWS. SO I SAT DOWN WITH AMBASSADOR DANIEL BAER OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. DAN BAER.
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU CAN CALL ME BUDDY COLE.
YOU CAN CALL ME DAN.
OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL BECAUSE THOSE HAPPEN TO BE OUR NAMES.
THAT'S TRUE.
SO DAN, WHAT ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS AN AMBASSADOR?
WELL, WE WORK TO ADVANCE U.S. FOREIGN POLICY IN MY CASE, AT THE IOC TO BRING THE VISION OF A EUROPE WHERE EVERYBODY HAS THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS RESPECTED TO REALITY.
SO YOU ARE ONE OF ONLY FIVE OPENLY GAY AMBASSADORS. DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW?
MY PARENTS DO KNOW.
AND HOW DID THEY TAKE IT WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THAT YOU WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT?
MY MOM HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MY CAREER FOR THE GOVERNMENT.
EVEN THOUGH BEING AN AMBASSADOR IS A CHOICE.
IT IS, YES.
SO AS AN AMBASSADOR ARE YOU ABOVE THE LAW?
NO, I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE ABOVE THE LAW, NO.
COULD YOU JUST LIKE HIT SOMEONE WITH YOUR CAR AND JUST WALK AWAY SCOT-FREE?
NO.
ISN'T THAT WHAT AMBASSADORS DO?
YOU KNOW, DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY --
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, WHAT'S THE POINT. OH, DO YOU HAVE A SWORD?
I DON'T HAVE A SWORD.
A CAPE?
I DON'T HAVE A CAPE.
DO THEY CALL YOU YOUR EXCELLENCY.
THEY DO FROM TIME TO TIME.
OH, OKAY, FINALLY SO, THERE ARE SOME PERKS.
THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME PERKS.
SO AS AN EXPERT, WHAT IS THE RUSSIAN ANTI-GAY LEGISLATION.
WELL, THE SO-CALLED GAY PROPAGANDA LAW BANS-- MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO TALK ABOUT NONTRADITIONAL SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS IN A WAY THAT WOULD EITHER MAKE THEM SEEM GOOD OR EQUAL TO OTHER RELATIONSHIPS.
SO WHAT ABOUT IF YOUR GAY RELATIONSHIPS WEREN'T EQUAL TO STRAIGHT RELATIONSHIPS?
WELL, I THINK THE QUESTION IS NOT A QUESTION ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP OR ANOTHER BUT --
ALL PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE TERRIBLE RELATIONSHIPS.
YOU KNOW.
WE SHOULD ALL BE FREE TO BE TRAPPED IN LOVELESS MARRIAGES.
HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT BUT I THINK WHETHER YOU ARE GAY OR STRAIGHT SHOULDN'T DETERMINE WHETHER YOU ARE.
SO THIS LAW MEANS THAT IF I WEAR LET'S SAY A RAINBOW T-SHIRT, THAT COULD GET ME ARRESTED?
WELL, I THINK IT COULD BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A VAGUE LAW.
BUT SERIOUSLY, DAN, DON'T YOU THINK WEARING A RAINBOW SHIRT SHOULD GET YOU ARRESTED. I MEAN WHY NOT JUST GO OUT DRESSED AS A UNICORN, IF YOU CAN'T DECIDE ON A COLOR WEAR BLACK OR NOTHING AT ALL, OR JUST DON'T GO OUT.
WHAT PEOPLE WEAR IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THEY EXPRESS THEMSELVES.
SO IN OTHER WORDS, NOT TOO MANY ZIPPERS. HOW MANY ZIPPERS ON AN OUTFIT COULD ONE HAVE WITHOUT APPEARING TOO GAY.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO OVERTHINK THIS.
BUTTONS, ARE BUTTONS GAYER THAN ZIPPERS?
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER HAD AN OPINION ON THAT.
I WAS TOLD THAT IN ORDER FOR ME TO BE SAFE I SHOULD GO ALL VELCRO, JUST SO IT HAS THAT MACHO SOUND WHEN YOU UNDO YOUR PANTS.
I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF THAT.
SO YOU BELIEVE THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO WEAR WHAT THEY WANT.
I DO.
OH. THAT'S INTERESTING. YOU'RE OUT ON A LIMB THERE, DAN.
HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT A VERY LONG ONE.
I HOPE IT'S A VERY THICK ONE.
LET ME CLARIFY, WILL THE OLYMPICS BE SAFE FOR ME?
I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE LATVIAN LUGE TEAM, I MEAN THEY'RE LUGERS, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW, I THINK AS WITH ALL LARGE SPORTING EVENTS, WE'RE ENCOURAGING EVERYBODY TO BE ATTENTIVE AND MAKE GOOD DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY.
I WOULDN'T WANT TO RUN  AFOUL OF THESE LAWS. I'VE BEEN PRACTICING SOME BASIC PHRASES TO HELP ME OUT OF TROUBLE. CAN YOU POINT ME TO THE NEAREST HARDWARE STORE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ONE.
I THINK DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT, PEOPLE MIGHT BE CONFUSED.
WOMEN, AM I RIGHT? WHO NEEDS THEM, EXCEPT FOR THEIR VAGINAS?
IS THAT --
I THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY GET YOU IN TROUBLE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE.
VAGINAS, CAN I HAVE TWO OF THEM-- CAN I HAVE ONE IN EACH COLOR.
HOW ABOUT THAT?
YOU KNOW, I THINK THE BEST ADVICE IS TO JUST BE YOURSELF.
OKAY. WHAT DO YOU SAY, DAN, DO I HAVE OFFICIAL CLEARANCE TO ENTER SOCHI?
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, THE OFFICIAL CLEARANCE WILL COME FROM THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET A VISA.
THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF WORK.
I THINK IT'S WORTH DOING.
OKAY, WELL, THANK YOU, SIR. I PROMISE THAT I WON'T LET AMERICA DOWN.
HAVE A GOOD TRIP, AND BE SAFE.
WELL, I LEARNED A LOT. AND I'M SURE I'LL REMEMBER SOME OF IT. SO I'M READY FOR RUSSIA BUT IS RUSSIA READY FOR ME? (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BUDDY COLE, EVERYBODY. CHEERS THANK YOU, BUDDY.
