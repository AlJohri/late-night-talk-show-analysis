WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT AS A FILM PRODUCER WHO IS GIVING AWAY HALF OF HIS FORTUNE.   I ASSUME HE PRODUCED "47 RONIN". PLEASE WELCOME JEFF SKOLL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BOOM. JEFF, IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OK NOW FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MAY NOT KNOW WHO ARE YOU, AND PLEASE FORGIVE THEM LET'S GET YOUR CV OUT THERE.
RIGHT.
OKAY, YOU WERE, AN ENGINEER, INTERNET ENTREPRENEUR, PHILANTHROPIST AND ARE YOU ALSO FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF PARTICIPANT MEDIA.
THAT IS CORRECT.
Stephen: SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT TO DO WITH PARTICIPANT MEDIA.
SO PARTICIPANT IS SORT OF A DREAM I HAD AS A KID TO TELL STORIES THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. AND I THOUGHT I WOULD DO THAT BY BEING A WRITER. BUT PARTICIPANT IS NOW A FULL-FLEDGED MOVIE AND TV STUDIO.
Stephen: A LOT OF THESE MOVIES, YOU KNOW, YOU CREATED A PLACE FOR, YOU KNOW, LIKE FILMS AND DOCUMENTARIES THAT HAVE SORT OF A LIBERAL AGENDA. THOSE ARE-- THERE'S A PLACE FOR THAT ALREADY. IT'S CALLED HOLLYWOOD.
HOLLYWOOD, YES, YES, THERE IS, INDEED,.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE FILMS. THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY BIG FILMS, LET'S GO THROUGH, WE'VE GOT SYRIANA IS YOURS, THE HELP, WAITING FOR SUPERMAN, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, LINCOLN AND AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH.
RIGHT. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AMONG OTHERS. NOW YOU MADE $3.8 BILLION AS ONE OF THE FIRST EMPLOYEES AS eBAY, ALL RIGHT. WHY WOULD YOU GO DO THIS WITH IT, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A YACHT AND HOOKERS AND BLOW?
RIGHT, NOW THAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE THING AND A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT I HAVE KNOWN OVER THE YEARS HAVE DONE JUST THAT.
Stephen: RIGHT. IT'S ONLY A SLIGHTLY QUICKER WAY TO LOSE YOUR MONEY THAN MAKING DOCUMENTARIES.
RIGHT, EXCEPT WITH DOCUMENTARIES YOU DO IT A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, BUT DO YOU THINK THESE FILMS ARE LIBERAL? BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE LIBERAL.
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE'RE PRESENTING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IMPORTANT ISSUES WHETHER IT'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR FOOD INSECURITY.
Stephen: PRO OR CON NUCLEAR WEAPONS, BY THE WAY?
VERY GOOD QUESTION.
Stephen: THANK YOU, HOW ABOUT A GOOD ANSWER?
WELL, WE TRY TO PRESENT INFORMATION FOR A CONVERSATION. AND WE TRY TO LET PEOPLE FIGURE OUT FROM THERE WHERE THEY WANT TO TAKE IT. SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE FILM WAITING FOR SUPERMAN, WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE U.S. EDUCATION SYSTEM WHICH IS BROKEN. AND WE PRESENTED THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. AND WE WORKED WITH A LOT OF EXPERTS AND ADVISORS AND THEN LEFT IT UP TO THE AUDIENCE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE. WHY IS OUR SYSTEM NOT WORKING QUITE THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER WORRIED THAT PERHAPS MOVIES HAVE TOO MUCH INFLUENCE ON US BECAUSE YOU'RE A BILLIONAIRE WHO CAN HELP BANKROLL SOME FILM. FOR INSTANCE, YOU HAD A FILM CALLED THE COVE, TELL PEOPLE WHAT THE COVE WAS ABOUT.
ABSOLUTELY, THANK YOU, YES. THE COVE WAS A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT DOLPHIN HUNTING IN JAPAN. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS A BIG INDUSTRY OF CAPTURING DOLPHINS, SELLING THEM TO SEA WORLD AND THEN-- .
Stephen: ALSO FOR MEAT TOO.
AND THEN SELLING THE REST FOR MEAT WHICH IS NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE DOLPHINS ARE AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN AND FULL OF MERCURY. SO WE DID A FILM CALLED THE COVE. AND IT GOT SO MUCH ATTENTION AND SO MANY PETITIONS THAT THE MEDIA CAMPED OUT IN TAIJI, JAPAN WHERE THEY WERE DOING THE FISHING, AND THE FISHING BOATS DIDN'T GO OUT.
Stephen: SO YOU ACTUALLY STOPPED IT.
FOR THE FIRST TIME WE STOPPED THE DOLPHIN HUNTING.
Stephen: OK, BUT THAT'S WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT, YOU GOT THEM TO STOP.
YES. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: COULDN'T ANOTHER BILLIONAIRE COME ALONG AND MAKE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT HOW DELICIOUS DOLPHIN IS? WHICH I OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND THEN IT WOULD START AGAIN, ISN'T IT JUST SORT OF A SHOOTING WAR BETWEEN GUYS WITH MONEY.
WELL, WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A SEQUEL SO MAYBE THAT'S AN IDEA. BUT NO, I THINK HONESTLY, PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY GOOD AND IF YOU GIVE GOOD PEOPLE INFORMATION ABOUT THINGS IN THE WORLD, THEN THEY'LL TAKE ACTION. AND WITH EVERY ONE OF OUR FILMS WE PUT TOGETHER CAMPAIGNS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET INVOLVED. IN PART WE DO THAT THROUGH OUR SITE TAKE PART WHICH IS OUR ONLINE SITE FOR ACTIVISTS. AND WE HAVE ABOUT 6 MILLION USERS AND ABOUT A MILLION ACTIONS WERE TAKEN LAST YEAR SIGNING PETITIONS, VOLUNTEERING TIME, GOING TO THE ORGANIZATIONS AND HELPING OUT. AND THIS IS GROWING REALLY FAST. AND SO WHEN YOU TIE TOGETHER THE INFORMATION OF THE FILMS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING, AND THE TRUST THAT GOOD PEOPLE WILL DO GOOD THINGS, GOOD THINGS HAPPEN.
Stephen: WELL, I MEAN, THAT SOUNDS ALL WELL AND GOOD. BUT ARE THERE TIMES WHEN YOU JUST GREEN LIGHT THINGS BECAUSE IT'S A WHIM LIKE YOU SAY TO YOURSELF, YOU DID CONTAGION, RIGHT.
YES.
Stephen: OK, DO YOU SAY TO YOURSELF, YOU KNOW, I'M A BILLIONAIRE, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT GWYNETH PALTROW LOOKS LIKE DEAD. [LAUGHTER]
SO CONTAGION WAS OUR ANSWER TO THE SWINE FLU WHICH EVERYONE HAD HEARD WAS GOING TO BE A REALLY TERRIBLE PANDEMIC.
Stephen: YES.
AND IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS BAD BUT IT WASN'T AS BAD AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN. AND ALL OF OUR EXPERTS SAY WE'RE OVERDUE FOR A REAL PANDEMIC. AND WE SAID WELL, LET'S SHOW WHAT A REAL PANDEMIC LOOKS LIKE SO THAT WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS, WE'RE NOT UNDERPREPARED. AND AT THE TIME THERE WAS A BIG PUSH, ESPECIALLY BY THE TEA PARTY FOLKS TO CUT FUNDING TO THE CDC. AND WE HAD SCREENING OF CONTAGION ON THE HILL AND AFTER SEEING THE SCREENINGS, THE TEA PARTY WITHDREW THEIR OBJECTIONS AND THE CDC GOT ITS FUNDING.
Stephen: WOW. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OKAY. LAST QUESTION AND I HAVE TO ASK THIS OF ALL MY GUESTS, CAN I HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS?
ABSOLUTELY. YOU HAD YOUR PAC WHICH I BELIEVE I'VE ALREADY CONTRIBUTED A BILLION TO.
Stephen: DID YOU GIVE MONEY TO THE COLBERT SUPER PAC.
OF COURSE I DID.
Stephen: THEN --.
I'M A BIG FAN, AS I SAID.
Stephen: I AM THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS WHERE THAT CASH ENDED UP AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: JEFF SKOLL, PARTICIPANT MEDIA. A LOT OF MOVIES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
