[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THE  COLD WAR ENDED IN 1989 BUT THEY  ALSO SAID RAT-TAILS WERE OVER. THEN WHY DOES "THIS BABY" FEEL  SO RIGHT? THIS IS COLD WAR UPDATE. NATION, THE KEY TO DEFEATING OUR  COMMIE ENEMIES HAS ALWAYS BEEN  ETERNAL READINESS TO LAUNCH OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS. BUT SADLY WE MAY NO LONGER BE  READY TO SAVE THE WORLD BY  DESTROYING IT.
TALK ABOUT A MORALE ISSUE  WHERE YOU DON'T REAL HE'LL WANT  ONE. EMAILS OBTAINED BY THE A.P. SHOW  THAT SOME MILITARY OFFICERS WHO  ARE IN CHARGE OF THE AIR FORCE'S MOST POWERFUL NUCLEAR WEAPONS  ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THEIR  JOBS.
Stephen: COMPLAINING? NUCLEAR LAUNCH OFFICER IS IS THE  COOLEST JOB EVER. NOW IF A GIRL SAYS SHE WOULDN'T  SLEEP WITH YOU IF YOU WERE THE  LAST MAN ON EARTH, YOU CAN CALL HER BLUFF. I WOULD LOVE TO BE IN YOUR PLACE  STANDING 24-HOUR WATCH OVER  NUCLEAR MISSILES ALERT AT ALL TIMES, READY TO LAUNCH UPON  PRESIDENTIAL ORDER. BUT INSTEAD OF FEELING HONORED  BY THEIR MONUMENTAL DUTY, THESE  OFFICERS ARE WHINING ABOUT BEING STUCK IN DEAD-END CAREERS. OH, COME ON! YOU HAVE TONS OF TRANSFERABLE  SKILLS. YEARS OF SITTING IN A CHAIR IN A  CONSTANT STATE OF PARANOIA WOULD  MAKE YOU PERFECT ANCHORS FOR FOX  NEWS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOT A LOT OF FOX NEWS FANS  TONIGHT. AND THIS ISN'T THE FIRST  INCIDENT UNDERMINING OUR NUCLEAR  READINESS, FOLKS. LAST MONTH, THE SAME LAUNCH  CREWS EARNED A D-GRADE ON THEIR  MASTERY OF MISSILE LAUNCH  OPERATIONS. A D-GRADE? COME ON. WE ARE FIGHTING THE CHINESE  HERE. YOU KNOW THEIR CREWS ARE GOING  TO EARN STRAIGHT... I WANT TO SAY, A BOOK SHELF ON  TOP OF A CHRISTMAS TREE. WELL, FOLKS, TO TELL YOU WHAT,  TO HELP PUMP UP THE NEXT  GENERATION FOR A REWARDING CAREER IN NUCLEAR SERVICE, I  HAVE DEVELOPED AN EXCITING NEW  VIDEO GAME: "CALL OF DUTY: PADDED CHAIR."  IT'S A FIRST-PERSON SITTER, AND  IT CAPTURES ALL THE EXCITEMENT  OF THE REAL THING. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SIT  PERFECTLY STILL NOT PUSHING A  BIG, BEAUTIFUL, SHINY, JOLLY BUTTON, THE RED, CANDY-LIKE  BUTTON. JUST BEGGING TO BE LAUNCHED. [BLEEP]. OH, WELL. YOU CAN PLAY AGAIN IN 100,000  YEARS. WE'LL BE RIGHT
