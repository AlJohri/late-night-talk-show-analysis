( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS HOLLYWOOD'S HOTTEST DIRECTOR PLEASE WELCOME J.J. ABRAMS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MAN, HOW ARE YOU?
VERY WELL.
Stephen:  IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. THE SQUIRREL'S IN THE BASKET, MAN. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE, YOU'RE THE EMMY AWARD-WINNING MEGADIRECTOR, OF "LOST" "ALIAS" AND NOW YOU'RE DOING THE "STAR WARS" MOVIE WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT? I KNOW YOU'RE DRYING DOOIG TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEW "STAR WARS" MOVIE BUT I'M SORRY, I CAN'T DO IT. NOT YET, NOT YET. NOW YOU'VE GOT A PROJECT THAT REALLY SHOOK ME, J.J.
OH, REALLY, HOW SO?
Stephen:  BECAUSE IT'S A BOOK. OKAY.
YUP.
NOT ONLY IS IT A BOOK. IT'S A BOOK THAT IS I THINK WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN INTO A MOVIE.
YEAH, THE GOAL OF THIS WAS NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE. IT WAS TO CREATE THE BOOK. THIS IS THE END GAME, WHAT YOU'RE HOLDING IN YOUR HAND.
Stephen:  THAT'S THE PART I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THIS BOOK IS NOT JUST ANY BOOK. IT'S A BOOK WITHIN A WEEK. IT'S A NOVEL THAT YOU CONCEIVED OF WITH A WRITER NAMED DOUG DORIS.
DOUG DORIS WROTE THE BOOK, DID AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB. THE IDEA WAS TO TAKE A NOVEL AND TO SAY WHAT IF SOMEONE LEFT A NOVEL IN A LIBRARY, A LIBRARY OBAMACARE AN OLD LIBRARY BOOK, AS IT IS.
Stephen:  LET ME OPEN THAT UP LIKE THAT.
AND YOU GET IN THIS SPORTY BLACK CASE, AND YOU TONE UP AND YOU HAVE A 1949 LIBRARY BOOK AND IF YOU LOOK IN THE BOOK, YOU SEE THERE'S WRITING INSIDE IN THE MARGINS. AND IT'S TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE MET THROUGH THE BOOK. THE BOOK BAKES VESSEL OF COMMUNICATION. IT'S SORT OF LIKE AN ANALOG TEXTING. ( LAUGHTER )
THEY'RE WRITING BACK AND FORTH AND INVESTIGATING THIS WRITER, WHO ESSENTIALLY WROTE THE BOOK.
Stephen:  OBVIOUSLY, I KNOW WHO B.M. SHROCK IS. THE BOOK IS SHROKASIAN. IS HE A REAL PERSON?
NO.
Stephen:  THERE IS A NOVEL THAT IS FAKE. AND THEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING TO EACH OTHER ARE ALSO MADE UP. SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S THREE STORIES IN ONE BOOK.
IT'S SORT OF A PLAY ON TOP OF A NOVEL. INSIDE THE BOOK YOU GET ALL THESE --
Stephen:  YOU HAVE LITTLE BITSAVE NEWSPAPER IN HERE.
LETTERS, A POSTCARD.
Stephen:  THIS IS AN ACTUAL NAPKIN WITH A MAP DRAWN ON IT. IS THIS A NOVEL OR IS THIS EVIDENCE OF YOUR SPIRALING INTO MADNESS? ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS THE SORT OF THING-- I HAVE TO SAY, J.J.UE KNOW I'M A FAN-- BUT THIS IS THE SORT OF THING WHEN THEY FIND THIS IN YOUR NEWSPAPERS THEY GO, "OF COURSE HE KILLED THOSE PEOPLE." LOOK AT THIS.
IT WAS EITHER THAT OR A LOT OF CASH. THE IDEA WITH THIS BOOK IS--
IT'S AN OBVIOUS GIMMICK. THE BOOK IS SORT OF AN EXPERIENCE, BUT WHAT DID DOUG DID IS RIGHT, AN EXTRAORDINARY BOOK THAT HAPPENS TO ALSO HAVE A LOT OF WEIRD STUFF STUCK IN THE PAGES.
Stephen:  YOU CONCEIVED OF THIS BOOK. IT ACTUALLY HAS A LIBRARY-- IT HAS A DEWEY DECIMAL CARD.
THEY DID AN AMAZING JOB.
Stephen:  IT'S DESIGNED LIKE A LIBRARY BOOK. IT EVEN HAS, LIKE, WHAT IS THIS--
IT'S A CODE WHEEL GLAI CODE WHEEL. HOLD ON, HOLD ON HELP HOLD ON. DRINK. MORE OVALTEEN.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. I WAS AT THE AIRPORT, AND I SAW A PAPERBACK NOVEL --
Stephen:  BACK WHEN YOU FLEW PUBLIC. OKAY, GO AHEAD. ( LAUGHTER ).
AND THERE WAS THIS PAPERBACK SITTING ON A BENCH BEFORE THEY WOULD CLOSE DOWN THE AIRPORT BECAUSE THE BOOK-- AND I WENT OVER, PICKED IT UP, AND IT WAS A LUDLOW NOVEL, AND SOMEONE HAD WRITTEN INSIDE, WHOEVER FINDS THIS BOOK, PLEASE READ THE BOOK, TAKE IT SOMEWHERE AND LEAVE IT FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO FIND IT. SIGNED JANET.
Stephen:  GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD, YES. ( LAUGHTER )
SO I STARTED THINKING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF-- ( LAUGHTER ) I THOUGHT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEONE-- IT REMINDED ME OF BEING IN COLLEGE, AND YOU'D SEE THE NOTES PEOPLE WOULD LOAF AND I THOUGHT WHAT IF THAT BECAME A CONVERSATION BETWEEN PEOPLE.
Stephen:  THE BOOK CAME INTO FRUITION BETWEEN AND YOU DOUG DORIS.
HE'S AN AMAZING AUTHOR.
Stephen:  IS HE AN ACTUAL AUTHOR OR IS HE MADE UP, TOO?
HE IS.
Stephen:  I HAVE TO SAY HIS AME IS A FAIRLY OBVIOUS AN ANAGRAM. COME ON, J.J.
HE'S REAL, HE'S REAL.
Stephen:  ARE YOU READY TO MOVE SOME PAPER? LET'S MOVE THE PAPER. WHAT PAGE DOES YODA SHOW UP ON?
38. NO. THIS IS NOTHING TO DO WITH "STARWARS" BUT I CANNOT WAIT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT "STAR WARS."
IT'S SO EARLY.
Stephen:  IT IS SO EARLY. YOU'RE DOING THE ""STAR TREK"" MOVIES AND YOU'RE DOING "STAR WARS" NOW. WHICH GROUP OF FANS SEEMS THE MOST FRIGHTENING WHEN THEY APPROACH YOU? WHICH GROUP OF THEM MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN A ROOM WITHOUT ANY DOORS SLOWLY FILLING WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S NEEDS?
NO, I'M GRATEFUL TO ALL --
Stephen:  ALL OF THEM, REALLY? ALL OF THEM.
Stephen:  REALLY, OKAY?
SURE. I FEEL INCREDIBLY LUCKY TO BE INVOLVED WITH THESE THINGS AND THE FANS ARE WHY WE'RE DOING THE MOVIE.
Stephen:  I UNDERSTAND. IS THERE GOING TO BE ANOTHER "STAR TREK" MOVIE?
THERE IS GOING TO BE A THIRD, AND THEY'RE WORKING ON IT NOW, AND THERE WILL BE SOMEONE ELSE DIRECTING IT.
Stephen:  ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A SEXY ROMULAN? A DANCY LADY? THE GUY WITH THE BIG BUTT FOREHEAD?
ARE YOU GOING TO HELP US OUT.
Stephen:  OF COURSE, OF COURSE, YOU KIDDING?
I'M IN, IF YOU'RE IN.
Stephen:  I'M IN, BABY DOLL. J.J. ABRAMS. THE BOOK IS "S."
