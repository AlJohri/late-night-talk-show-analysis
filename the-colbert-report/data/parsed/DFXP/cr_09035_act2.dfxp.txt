Stephen: YOU LOOK  FANTASTIC FOR A 90-YEAR-OLD  WOMAN.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I DRESSED  UP LIKE GROUCHO MARX FOR  HALLOWEEN. I WAS REALLY INTO THE MARKS  BROTHERS. AND MY AUNT WAS INVOLVED IN  20s AND MY DAD COLLECTED  RECORDS AND I THOUGHT  EVERYBODY LOVED JAZZ AND OLD MUSIC AND JOHNSON SO I  DIDN'T START DISCOVERING  UNTIL I WAS 16. I MEAN YOU DIDN'T GROW UP IN  GREAT AMERICA, YOU GREW  NEWSPAPER CANADA.
BUT VERY CLOSE TO THE  BORDER.

YES. I ACTUALLY COULD. BECAUSE WE LIVED RIGHT,  WELL, ON VANCOUVER ISLAND.
Stephen: THE COVER OF  THIS ALBUM, WE HAVE THAT  COVER UP ON THE ALBUM RIGHT  THERE. I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH I  LIKED JAZZ YOU GOT SOME HEAT  FOR THIS. WHY DID YOU GET HEAT FOR  THIS. ARE JAZZ WOMEN NOT ALLOWED  TO BE ATTRACTIVE?

Stephen: OKAY, SURE,  DON'T NEED TO KNOW. (LAUGHTER)
PUBLICLY IN THE DRESS UP  BOX. BUT A LOT OF THE IDEA OF THE  FLAPPER IN THE 20s, THERE IS  SORT OF A DARKER SIDE WAS ALFRED FINNY JOHNSON  PICTURES OF THE-- GIRLS WERE  DRESSED VERY PROVOCATIVELY. AND I WAS TRACTED TO THE  SONG IN GLAD RAG DOLL WHICH  I FOUND T IS LITTLE PAINTED LADY, IT ISN'T 5 FOOT 2 EYES  OF BLUE. IT'S LITTLE PAINTED LADY,  AND-- .
Stephen: ABOUT  PROSTITUTES.
