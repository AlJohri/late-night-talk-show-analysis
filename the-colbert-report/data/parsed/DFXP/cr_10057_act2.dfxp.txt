Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (AUDIENCE CHEERING) THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE, PLEASE. FOLKS, YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW THESE PEOPLE JUST KEEP GIVING AND GIVING TONIGHT. NATION, REGULAR VIEWERS KNOW I LOVES ME MY "HARRY POTTER" BOOKS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT A KID WITH DARK HAIR AND GLASSES WHO SAVES THE WORLD THAT JUST SPEAKS TO ME. [LAUGHTER] BUT ON SUNDAY "HARRY POTTER" AUTHOR J.K. ROWLING ROCKED THE MUGGLE WORLD WITH THIS REVELATION. JIM, ACCIO FOOTAGE.
HARRY POTTER AUTHOR J.K. ROWLING SAID THAT HER CHARACTER HERMOINE GRANGER SHOULD HAVE ENDED UP WITH HARRY POTTER INSTEAD OF RON WEASLEY. ROWLING SAYS SHE PUT RON AND  HERMIONE TOGETHER FOR QUOTE, "VERY PERSONAL REASONS." SHE GOES ON TO SAY IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE BEST MATCH.
Stephen: YES! J.K. ROWLING FINALLY ADMITTED WHAT WE READERS HAVE KNOWN  ALL ALONG. HARRY AND HERMOINE ARE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER! YOU DON'T NEED A SORTING HAT TO FIGURE THAT OUT. IT'S AS CLEAR AS THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN DUMBLEDORE AND VOLDEMORT! (LAUGHTER) THAT WHICH MUST NOT BE NAMED IS THEIR LOVE. [LAUGHTER] (LAUGHTER) WELL, J.K. I DEMAND YOU GIVE US THE ENDING WE DESERVE WITH A NEW BOOK "HARRY POTTER AND THE REALIZATION HE'S MADE A HUGE MISTAKE." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IN THIS ONE HARRY TURNS HIS BACK ON HIS WIFE AND KIDS AND HAS AN ILLICIT AFFAIR WITH HERMOINE AT THE HOGSMEADE BEST WESTERN. [LAUGHTER] IT ALL GOES DOWN IN ROOM 414-3/4. LET'S JUST SAY THAT'S NOT MOANING MYRTLE YOU'RE HEARING. (AUDIENCE REACTS) HARRY AND HERMOINE NEED TO GET TOGETHER. DON'T WORRY ABOUT RON, HE'LL BE FINE. IT'S ALL IN THE FINAL BOOK "RON WEASLEY AND THE STUDIO APARTMENT OF SHAME." (LAUGHTER) RON GOES ON FANTASTIC ADVENTURES WITH HIS NEW BEST FRIENDS-- A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA AND A FUTON HE FOUND ON THE CURB. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
