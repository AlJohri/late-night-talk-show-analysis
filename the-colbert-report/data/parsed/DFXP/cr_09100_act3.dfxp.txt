Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT DIRECT THE NEW  FILM ADAPTATION OF "THE GREAT  GATSBY" IN 3D. IT'S LIKE YOUR HOMEWORK IS  COMING RIGHT AT YOU. PLEASE WELCOME BAZ LUHRMAN. BAZ THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. BAZ, PEOPLE KNOW YOU FROM "ROMEO  AND JULIETTE ITS REQUEST RULON  ROUGE. WHAT TACKLE THE CAN THE GRAY? YOU'RE AN AUSSIE, THIS IS THE  GREAT AMERICAN STORY.
PAYBACK, I GUESS FOR WHAT YOU  GUYS HAVE BEEN TAKING CLASSICS  AND DOING THEM IN HOLLYWOOD FOR  YEARS.
Stephen:  EXACTLY. WE MADE AN OPERA OUT OF  "CROCODILE DUNDEE."  PAYBACK TIME.
ACTUALLY, MY OWN PERSONAL  EXPERIENCE WAS I KNEW IT WHEN I I  WAS A CHILD.
Stephen:  DO THEY TEACH IT  OVER THERE?
YES, THEY DO. EXACTLY THE SAME AS HERE.
Stephen:  DO THEY TRANSLATE  IT INTO AUSTRALIAN FOR YOU GUYS? ( LAUGHTER )
YES. AFTER "RULON ROUGE" I WAS  TRAVELING ON THE SIBERIAN  EXPRESS, AND HAD TWO RECORDED  BOOK. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OTHER  ONE WAS, BUT ONE WAS F. SCOTT  FITZGERALD, THE CAN THE GRAY. I PUT IT ON --
Stephen:  LET'S TALK ABOUT  THE OTHER BOOK FOR A WHILE.
NEXT BOOK CLUB. PIT IT ON AND FIVE HOURS LATER I  WOKE UP AND I REALIZED--  ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  YOU FELL ASLEEP  DURING "THE GREAT GATSBY."  AND YOU SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) HAS HAPPENED. AND I GOT TO MAKE A MOVIE OF  THAT THING.
THIS REALLY NEEDS A MOVIE.
Stephen:  WHY DO THIS NOW? THIS BOOK CAME OUT SOMETHING  LIKE 90 YEARS AGO AND THERE HAVE  BEEN SIX MOVIES MADE OF IT. THERE WAS A SILENT MOVIE MADE OF  THIS THING.
YES, INDEED.
Stephen:  WHY MAKE IT AGAIN  NOW AND WHY 3D?
FIRST OF ALL, --
Stephen:  PICK THOSE  QUESTIONS-- PICK THE ONE YOU  LIKE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  FIRST OF ALL, I  MEAN, IT IS AN INCREDIBLY MODERN  BOOK, AND IT IS USEFUL AT ANY TIME AND ANY PLACE, AND I THINK  THERE SHOULD BE-- IT'S LIKE  "HAMLET."  EACH PERIOD AND EACH TIME NEEDS ITS PRODUCTION OF HAMLET. AND I THINK IN L.A. WHEN WE HAD  THE FINANCIAL CRASH, I REALLY  COMMITTED IN THAT MOMENT SAYING RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. I'VE GOT TO TRY TO FIND A WAY OF  SOLVING THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEMS  OF THE BOOK, AND THAT IS MOST OF IT IS INTERNAL DIALOGUE INSIDE  NICK CAR WAY'S HEAD.
Stephen:  I LOVED THE FILM  BIKER THE WAY.
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  I FELL ASLEEP  DURING IT, AND WHEN I WOKE UP I  THOUGHT--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  THANK YOU. GO AHEAD, YES, YES.
LET ME ASK THIS QUESTION. HINK WHEN NICK BEGINS THISIT  STORY HE GOES IN AND HE DIDN'T  KNOW WHO HE IS OR WHAT HE IS. AND HE REALLY ENDS THE BOOK--  DOES HE WANT TO WRITE? WHAT IS IT HIS LIFE JOURNEYING  IF TO BE? WHAT'S HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH  PEOPLE. HE STARTS ON HIS OWN TO FIND OUT  WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE WANTS AT  THE END OF BOOK.
Stephen:  DO PEOPLE HAVE TO  HAVE READ THE BOOK TO ENJOY THE  MOVIE?
NO, THE FILM NEEDS TO STAND--  IN FACT, I'VE MET MANY PEOPLE  NOW WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILMAND HAVE GONE TO READ THE BOOK. LOOK, WHEN FITZGERALD GUYED, HE  WAS BUYING COPIES OF HIS OWN  BOOK.
Stephen:  BECAUSE NO ONE  WAS READING IT, RIGHT?
JUST SO THERE WERE SOME  SAILS. HE WAS THAT FORGOTTEN, AND THE  IDEA THAT LAST WEEK HE SOLD MORE  BOOKS IN ONE WEEK THAN HIS ENTIRE LIFETIME, THAT ALONE I  THINK IS A POSITIVE OUTCOME OF  THE EXPERIENCE OF MAKING THE FILM FOR ME  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  YOU'RE AN  ARTIST-- WHY DO YOU THINK--  YOU'RE AN ARTIST WHO WAS ACCEPTED IN HIS LIFETIME. I'M AN ARTIST SUSPECTED IN MY  LIFETIME. ARE GREAT ARTISTS MORE SEND  AFTER THEY'RE DEAD?
YOU KNOW WHAT. I WAS READING A CRITICISM OF CAN  THE "GREAT GATSBY" AND HE CALLED  F. SCOTT FITZGERALD A CLOWN, AND OF THE BOOK HE SAID IT WAS  SOMETHING LIKE SHALLOW. SOMETHING HAMMOND THE OTHER  NIGHT THAT TOOK ME BY COMPLETE  SURPRISE. WE HAD A SCREENING AND A VERY  REGAL WOMAN CAME OUT OF THE  AUDIENCE I'VE NEVER MET AND TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND SAID, "I'VE  COME ALL THE WAY FROM VERMONT  BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE WHAT DID YOU WITH MY GRANDFATHER'S BOOK."  OF COURSE I WENT COLD. I HAD NEVER MET THIS PERFECT  PERSON. SHE WAS WONDERFUL. AND THEN SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, I  THINK HE WOULD BE VERY PROUD FOR  PEOPLE HAVE SAID FOR SO LONG HE CAN'T TURN AN INTERNAL NARRATION  INTO A FILM. IT WILL NET GET BETTER FOR ME  THAN THAT MOMENT. THE IDEA THAT F. SCOTT  FITZGERALD DIED THINKING THAT  BOOK WAS NOT CARED FOR, THAT NO ONE WANTED TO BUY TAND THAT IT  BECAME THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL,  AND THEY'RE HAVING GATSBY PARTIES THIS WEEKEND, AND  OPENING HERE, 20 MILES FROM  WHERE HE WROTE IT. IT'S ALL TOO MUCH OF A CIRCLE. FOR ME, WITH ALL OF THE EFFORT  AND EVERYTHING THAT EVERYONE HAS  PUT INTO IT, IT'S ALREADY A WORGT WHILE JOURNEY.
Stephen:  WELL,  CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  BAZ
