WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,  THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCHED THIS  SHOW YOU KNOW I'M IN BITTER  COMPETITION WITH THE OPRAH BOOK CLUB. WELL, NEXT TUESDAY SEPTEMBER  10th WE'LL HAVE OUR SECOND  INSTALLMENT OF THE COLBERT BOOK CLUB THIS TIME  DEDICATED TO AUTHOR  J.D. SALINGER. SO BY NEXT TUESDAY, READ  ANYTHING YOU WANT BY  SALINGER EXCEPT CATCHER IN  THE RYE. I DON'T CARE FOR IT. PLEASE JOIN US, I GUARANTEE  IT WILL BE A PERFECT NIGHT  FOR BANANA FISH. THAT'S A LITERARY REFERENCE. I'M TOLD. GO OVER HERE. FOLKS, YOU KNOW IT IS A  DANGEROUS WORLD OUT THERE  AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY UNDER  THREAT OF VIOLENCE EVEN IN OUR OWN HOME. FOR INSTANCE, A SUSPICIOUS  STRANGER COMES UP TO MY  HOUSE SIX DAYS A WEEK TO  DELIVER RANSOM NOTES. PAY YOUR MORTGAGE OR WE'LL  REPOSSESS YOUR HOUSE, SORRY  BUT I DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH  TERRORISTS. THAT'S WHY I'M ALWAYS ON THE  LOOKOUT FOR THE LATEST IN  HOME PROTECTION. NOW I HAD PREVIOUSLY TOLD  YOU ABOUT THE BED BUNKER, A  BED WITH A BUILT-IN GUN SAFE  UNDERNEATH. FOLKS, THERE IS NO BETTER  PLACE TO REST YOUR HEAD  AFTER AN EXHAUSTING DAY OF  PARANOIA. WHAT ABOUT THOSE VULNERABLE  HOURS WHEN YOU'RE NOT  SLEEPING?
DON'T WORRY, FOLKS,  BECAUSE THE MAKERS OF BED  BUNKER HAVE AN ANSWER.
IT'S A SOFA THAT COULD  POSSIBLY SAFE YOUR LIFE. A FORT WORTH FURNITURE  COMPANY IS MAKING THAT CLAIM  AS THEY MARKET A COUCH THAT CAN STORE RIFLES AND HAS  BULLETPROOF KITCHENS.
IT LOOKS LIKE A  NORMA-- NORMAL SOFA. OPEN UP THE LID AND YOU HAVE  A CON SELL GUN SAFE.
IT'S CALLED THE COUCH  BUNKER T WILL HELP YOU HIDE  UP TO 40 RIFLE ITS AND DODGE A BULLET TOO.
YOU CAN TAKE ONE OF THE  CUSHONS, HAND IT TO ONE OF  YOUR CHILDREN OR YOUR SPOUSE TO PROTECT THEM. AND THEN YOU CAN HOLD IT,  MAKE THEM WITH ARM STRAPS. YOU CAN HOLD THE CUSHON WITH  ONE HAND AND FIRE IT WITH  THE OTHER HAND.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN  WAITING FOR. A COUCH WITH BULLETPROOF  CUTCHONS. IT'S FOOLPROOF AS LONG AS  YOU YELL AT THE HOME INVADER,  ONLY SHOOT THE CUSHONS. AND AFTER THINK DO SHOOT  THEM REMEMBER TO PUSH THE  CUSHONS OVER SO YOUR HOUSE  STILL LOOKS NICE. PLUS THE KIDS CAN REARRANGE  THE CUSHONS TO MAKE A  BULLETPROOF FORCE TO KEEP  THEM SAFE FROM ROBBERS OR INDIANS OR LAVA. BUT I DO HAVE ONE PROBLEM  WITH THE COUCH BUNKER. YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE CUSHONS  OFF IN ORDER TO ACCESS YOUR  GUNS WHICH REQUIRES GETTING OFF THE COUCH. FRANKLY, I WOULD RATHER BE  DEAD. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD TO  INTRODUCE THE LATEST IN  LIVING ROOM PROTECTION, THE BARKA LAUNCHER. SIMPLY DUCT TAPE A KNIFE TO  YOUR HEAD AND PULL THE LEVER  ON YOUR SIDE TO LAUNCH YOURSELF REMEMBER, THE LEVER  ON THE RIGHT RECLINE, THE  LEVER ON THE LEFT MAKES YOU A HUMAN SPEAR. OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND. YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT. ORDER TODAY, WE'LL ALSO  THROW IN THIS PLUSH BEAN BAG  GEAR FULL OF GRENADES, SIT BACK, RELAX, AND PULL THE  PEN ON COMFORT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
