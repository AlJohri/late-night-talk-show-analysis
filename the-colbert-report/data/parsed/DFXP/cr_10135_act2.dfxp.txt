(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS, TIME WAS TO BE FAMOUS YOU HAD TO RISE ABOVE YOUR PEERS IN A GIVEN FIELD. WHETHER IT WAS ACTING OR JUMPING OR OWNING A LARGE PAIR OF PANTS. BUT THESE DAYS FAME IS FINALLY DEMOCRATIZED. JUST LOOK AT KIM KARDASHIAN. I AM A HUGE FAN OF WHATEVER IT IS SHE DOES. (LAUGHTER) SHE HAS PROVEN THAT BECOMING A CELEBRITY CAN BE A SKILL ALL OF ITS OWN. AND NOW THE TRAGICALLY FAMED DEFICIENT CAN GET A TASTE OF HER SUPERSTARDOM AT AMERICA'S MOST EXCLUSIVE BOUTIQUE, THE APP STORE.
REALITY STAR KIM KARDASHIAN LAUNCHED A NEW VIDEO GAME CALLED KIM KARDASHIAN "HOLLYWOOD"  IN THE GAME SHE INSTRUCTS USERS HOW TO BECOME A-LIST CELEBRITIES. THEY START OUT ON THE E LIST, NOT A FAR STRETCH  FROM HER OWN LIFE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THE KIM KARDASHIAN HOLLYWOOD APP SIMULATES HER RISE TO THE A LIST. TO WIN YOU MUST CAREFULLY NAVIGATE THROUGH 20 LEVELS OR UPLOAD ONE SEX TAPE. YOU BEGIN AS A LOWLY E LIST STORE CLERK UNTIL YOU ARE APPROACHED BY KIM WHO IS HAVING A FASHION EMERGENCY. YOU HELP HER PICK FROM ONE OF TWO DRESSES. THEN HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN GIVING IT TO HER FOR NO CHARGE OR PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY OPTION. BUT ONCE KIM TAKES YOU UNDER HER WING, YOU TAP YOUR WAY THROUGH THE HOTTEST PHOTO SHOOTS, THE TRENDIEST RUNWAY SHOWS AND THE MOST VACUOUS CELEBRITY PARTIES AVOIDING ANYTHING THAT COULD SET BACK YOUR CAREER. PRO TIP: DO NOT DATE RANDY QUAID. THE GOAL IS TO BRING YOUR AVATAR FROM THE E LIST TO THE A LIST WHICH TAKES HOURS OF TAPPING ON YOUR SCREEN. BUT ALL THE HARD WORK YOU'RE PUTTING IN IS JUST AS REAL AS THE FAME YOU'RE ACHIEVING. (LAUGHTER) BEST OF ALL KIM IS OFFERING THIS VIRTUAL FRIENDSHIP FOR FREE. ALL SHE GETS IN RETURN IS BRINGING JOY TO HER FANS AND $85 MILLION. SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF FROM, AGAIN, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT SHE DOES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HER CASH COMES FROM IN-APP PURCHASES. USERS CAN SPEND AS MUCH AS $99.99 FOR 175,000 VIRTUAL DOLLARS WHICH THEY CAN THEN USE TO BUY THE LIGHTNING BOLTS OF ENERGY NEEDED TO COMPLETE TASKS. OF COURSE A REAL CELEBRITY WOULD NEVER BUY ENERGY. YOUR ASSISTANT PICKS UP GRAMS OF ENERGY FOR YOU FROM SOME GUY WITH A FACE TATTOO BEHIND THE IN N OUT BURGER. FOLKS, SEEING AVERAGE AMERICANS THROW AWAY MILLIONS ON A CELEBRITY iPHONE GAME IS DISTURBING BECAUSE I'M NOT THAT CELEBRITY. WELL THAT ENDS TONIGHT. I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE MY APP, "STEPHEN COLBERT, I'D TAP THAT." THE GAME BEGINS (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE GAME BEGINS WHEN YOUR AVATAR MEETS WORLD FAMOUS CELEBRITY STEPHEN COLBERT AND I GREET WITH YOU MY FAMOUS CATCH-PHRASE, GIVE ME $5. AND UNLIKE KIM'S GAME YOU HAVE OPTIONS. YOU CAN GIVE ME $5 OR YOU CAN GIVE ME $10. THAT SKIPS YOU WRITE TO C LIST FRIEND LEVEL WHERE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO GIVE ME $20. SO FOLKS, DOWNLOAD NOW AND START TAPPING YOUR MONEY MY WAY. I NEED IT. I'M JUST A FEW DOLLARS SHORT OF THE SILVER SHUTTER SHADES I NEED TO GET NVITED TO KIM'S MIAMI BEACH HOUSE. PLEASE NOTICE ME. PLEASE! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. PLEASE NOTICE ME!
