Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WON THREE  EMMYS, TWO OSCARS, AND TWO  GOLDEN GLOBES. BUT STILL NO MTV MOVIE AWARD FOR  BEST ROUND-HOUSE KICK IN A  ROMANTIC COMEDY. PLEASE WELCOME SALLY FIELD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HAVE A SEAT. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT. WHAT A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU  HERE. I'M AN ENORMOUS FAN.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Stephen: AND --
YEAH, WHAT?
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE  ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT ME.
ME, TOO OF YOU.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO  SAY THANK REALLY I AM. THE ONLY TIME MY CHILDREN ARE  GOING TO BE WATCH ME BECAUSE  THEY WERE THRILLED I WAS ON YOUR  SHOW.
Stephen: WOW. YOU SOUND LIKE YOU RAISED SOME  REALLY SMART KIDS.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO GET  INTO YOUR, YOU KNOW, YOUR LEFT  WING HOLLYWOOD, YOU KNOW SCREED  LATER.
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
Stephen: FIRST I WANT TO  TALK ABOUT THIS MOVIE, LINCOLN.
OKAY.
Stephen: IT'S SUCH A  BRILLIANT MOVISM I HAVE NEVER  BEEN MOVED BY PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE BEFORE. BUT IT REALLY DOES -- WHY DID  YOU WANT TO PLAY MARY TODD SO  MUCH?
ARE YOU FINISHED? NOW I MEANT I WANTED TO GET ALL  THE QUESTION.
Stephen: PLEASE ANSWER. WHY?
WELL, SHE'S SUCH A  COMPLICATED, UNDEREXAMINED,  UNDERAPPRECIATED VALUABLE FEMALE IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
Stephen: LET'S SHOW A SCENE  RIGHT HERE, JIMMY, OF THE POWER  OF MARY TODD.
WHEN I HAVE EVER BEEN SO  EASILY BAMBOOZLED BUT AMENDING  THE CONSTITUTION AND ABOLISHING SLAVERY WILL END THIS WAR AND  SINCE YOU ARE SENDING MY SON TO  THE WAR, WO SERKS YOU IF YOU FAIL TO PASS THE AMENDMENT.
WE'RE LEAVING BIG BLOODY FOOT  PRINTS ALL OVER TOWN.
NO ONE KNOWS BETTER THAN YOU  THE PROPER PLACEMENT OF THE  PATH. JUST DO IT IF YOU MUST BECAUSE  IF YOU FAIL TO ACQUIRE THE  NECESSARY VOTES --
Stephen: WOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HISTORICALLY ACCURATE. SHE HAD THAT KIND OF INFLUENCE  OVER HER HUSBAND?
OH, YES.
Stephen: REALLY?
YES, SHE DID. SHE ALWAYS DID.
Stephen: HE HAD HER PUT  AWAY AT SOME POINT, DIDN'T HE?
NO, NO.
Stephen: HE DIDN'T HAVE TO  GIVE HER QUIET TIME.
EVERYONE HAD TO GIVE HER  QUIET TIME. SHE WAS VERY COLORFULFUL HIGHLY  EMOTIONAL AND SHE WENT THROUGH A  LOT OF BAD THINGS. LOSS OF CHILDREN AND EVENTUALLY  SHE LOST HIM AND THEN IT WENT ON  AND GOT WORSE FROM THERE. SHE WAS REALLY A TRAGIC, TRAGIC  CHARACTER.
Stephen: MAYBE NOT -- MAYBE  NOT INSANE BUT MAD FROM GRIEF?
SHE WAS. SHE WAS. AND AT THE END OF HER LIFE. SHE STAYED MAD LITERALLY PERIOD  BUT WHO WOULDN'T BE?
Stephen: CAN WE TALK ABOUT  WHAT MAKES ME MAD.
I THINK SO. GO AHEAD.
Stephen: SPIELBERG MAKING  YOU AUDITION FOR THIS WILL PART. YOU ARE SALLY GOD DAMN FIELD. I DON'T SEE WHY HE GETS ASKING  TO YOU AUDITION, OKAY? WHY DO YOU DO THAT? YOU DON'T AUDITION FOR THINGS.
WELL, I DID. AND I NEEDED TO. AND I'M GLAD I DID.
Stephen: SO YOU HAD TO GO  MEET DANIEL DAY-LEWIS?
NO, NO, NO NOT REALLY. EVERYBODY JOINED IN AS A CAST. IT WAS WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO TO  ENEARTH MARY. STEVEN WASN'T SURE I WAS RIGHT. HE ASKED ME TO DO THE ROLE SUCH  A LONG TIME AGO. IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THE  MAGNIFICENT SCREENPLAY AND  DANIEL DAY-LEWIS WAS ON BOARD. HE WASN'T SURE THE DYNAMIC WAS  RIGHT. I SAID I WON'T WALK AWAY. HE SAID WHAT IF I TEST YOU. DANIEL CAME ON BOARD. HE FLEW IN FROM IRELAND TO LOS  ANGELES FOR THE DAY SO STEVEN  COULD SEE US ON FILM TOGETHER.
Stephen: DID YOU MEET HIM  OR LINCOLN?
UM, YOU KNOW IT'S -- I DON'T  THINK HE MET ME EITHER. WE BOTH MET AS EARLY VERSION OF  MARY AND EARLY VERSION OF MR. LINCOLN AND IT WAS THE BEGINNING  OF WHAT YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN  FINALLY. IT'S WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE AND  IT WAS INCREDIBLY GENEROUS FOR  STEVEN TO GO WITH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THEN IT WAS  AMAZING THAT HE DROPPED  EVERYTHING HE FELT AND SAID, OKAY, I'LL GO WITH WHAT YOU'VE  GOT.
Stephen: YOU SAID YOU  ALWAYS FELT LIKE AN OUTSIDER IN  THE INDUSTRY THAT YOU WORKED IN SINCE YOU WERE A KID, RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: WHY? PEOPLE -- EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.
I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT INVITED TO VERY MANY  PARTIES OR ANYTHING. I JUST DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: WANT TO GO GET A  DRINK? [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I DON'T KNOW. AREN'T YOU MARRIED?
Stephen: AREN'T YOU?
NO. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELL, SALLY, THANK  YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
THANK YOU. THAT'S IT. I DON'T GET ANYMORE.
Stephen: NO, OF COURSE WE  DO. [ LAUGHTER ] WE DO. OF COURSE. OH, OH, YES, I HAVE TO ASK --
OKAY, YEAH.
Stephen: YOU GAINED 25  POUNDS FOR THIS ROLE.
GOOD QUESTION. GOOD QUESTION. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: TRUE?
I DID.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU DO IT?
A ATE A WHOLE LOT OF FOOD.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY YOU ARE  A SUPERSTAR.
I KNOW.
Stephen: 25 POUNDS YOU ARE  A LITTLE THING. I KNOW YOU GOT THE BONIVA. DO YOUR BONES HAVE THE  STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY TO HOLD THE  25 POWNS.
THEY DO NOW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN  TAKING BONIVA. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHO COULD  HAVE USED BONIVA? MARY TODD LINCOLN. SHE WE ARE THE COUNTRY ON HER  BACK.
SHE DID. SHE DID. I BET SHE WASN'T INVITED TO A  LOT OF PARTIES EITHER.
Stephen: SHE WASN'T. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME, SALLY
