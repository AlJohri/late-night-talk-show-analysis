Stephen: TONIGHT, THE GOP  TRIES TO APPEAL TO HISPANICS. FIRST STEP, LEARNING TO SPEAK  HIS-SPANISH. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, CAN PRESIDENT OBAMA GET  THE SUPPORT OF GUN OWNERS? YES, AFTER A FOUR-YEAR WAITING  PERIOD. [ LAUGHTER ] AND MY GUEST, JUSTICE SONIA  SOTOMAYOR, IS THE FIRST HISPANIC  ON THE SUPREME COURT. I WILL ASK HER QUESTIONS IN  HISS-SPANISH. [ LAUGHTER ] FIDEL CASTRO MADE HIS FIRST  PUBLIC APPEARANCE IN THREE  YEARS. THEN HE SAW HIS SHADOW, SO FIFTY  MORE YEARS OF COMMUNISM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING]  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL [EAGLE CAW] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] THANK  YOU HAVE MUCH. PLEASE, SIT DOWN, NATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME --  WELCOME TO THE BROADCAST  PRESENTED TONIGHT WITH LIMITED  COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS, I'M STILL COMING DOWN  FROM LAST NIGHT'S SUPERBOWL  RAGER. I HAD THE WHOLE WRECKING CREW  OVER AND THEY BROUGHT IT. AND BY IT, I MEAN A LOVELY  SPINACH DIP BREAD BOWL, COURTESY  OF LOU DAWG. [ LAUGHTER ] WOOF WOOF! THE DOG IS LOOSE! THE DOG IS IN THE HOUSE! AND WANTS HIS SERVING TRAY BACK  AT SOME POINT! [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS A SUPERBOWL FOR THE AGES. A PHOTO FINISH, SQUEAKER AT THE  BUZZER, AAAAAND WHO WON? WHO WON? THE RAVENS. THE RAVENS WON. [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD, GOOD. PERFECT. [  APPLAUSE  ] SOUNDS GREAT. BONUS! NOW RAY LEWIS HAS AS MANY  SUPERBOWL RINGS AS MURDER  INDICTMENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] EVENS IT OUT. BUT OF COURSE, THE REAL WINNERS  WERE AMERICAN CONSUMERS, BECAUSE  THE ADS KILLED IT THIS YEAR. THEY HAD IT ALL:  A  DORITOS-EATING GOAT, [ LAUGHTER ] A MAN OUTRUNNING A CHEETAH, [ LAUGHTER ] A GUY WHO LOST WEIGHT 15 YEARS  AGO. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE TEARJERKER OF THE NIGHT  WAS THE TOUCHING STORY OF A  MAN'S LOVE FOR A HORSE. AND THAT'S NOT JUST LOVE IN THE  HORSE'S EYES. IT'S ALSO GRATITUDE THAT IT  WORKS FOR BUDWEISER AND NOT  BURGER KING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THERE WAS ONE PART OF THE  GAME I DIDN'T CARE FOR-- THE  HALFTIME SHOW. BEYONCE. WAS SHE GREAT? OF COURSE. BUT  A YOUNG, VITAL SINGER AT  THE TOP OF HER GAME IS JUST  UNNATURAL. [ LAUGHTER ] TRADITIONAL SUPERBOWL HALFTIMES  ARE SUPPOSED TO BE  ARTHRITIC LEGENDS DECADES PAST [ LAUGHTER ] THEIR PRIME SHAMBLING THROUGH  THEIR CATALOG OF OLDIES. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN LOOK AT HER, SHE DOESN'T  EVEN HAVE VISIBLE NECK WATTLE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO SAD. OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY IS WHAT  HAPPENED IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
WE HAVE A POWER OUTAGE AT THE  SUPER DOME. THERE WAS A SURGE IN THE  BUILDING AND ALL OF THE LIGHTS  HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT.
BLACKOUT BOWL.
BLACKOUT BOWL.
BLACKOUT BOWL! THE LIGHTS GO OUT FOR 35  MINUTES.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, 35  MINUTES WITHOUT POWER. ONLY TWO MONTHS SHORT OF NEW  ORLEANS' PERSONAL BEST. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'LL GET THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] NO ONE'S SURE WHAT CAUSED THE  OUTAGE, BUT I BELIEVE IT MAY  HAVE STARTED WITH AN ELECTRICAL  SHORT. HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, COULD BE TROUBLE. DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. MIGHT WANT TO CHECK THE WIRING  ON THAT THING. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY EVENTUALLY GOT POWER  RESTORED, BUT I WAS  DISAPPOINTED. THAT STOP DOWN WAS 35 MINUTES OF  DARKNESS THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN  FILLED WITH ADS. AND DON'T TELL ME YOU COULDN'T  FIND A SPONSOR. BECAUSE I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT  MANY OF MY BLACKOUTS ARE BROUGHT  TO YOU BY CAPTAIN MORGAN. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE  FIRST LATINA ON THE SUPREME  COURT. SO TO ANY HISPANIC VIEWERS  JOINING US FOR THE FIRST TIME, I  WANT TO SAY: WELCOME! [ LAUGHTER ] AND I ASSURE YOU THAT WELCOME  HAS AN UPSIDE-DOWN EXCLAMATION  MARK IN FRONT OF IT. OR AS I CALL IT, A  "MEXCLAMATION" MARK. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, NACION, I'VE LONG HAD A  DEEP RESPECT FOR THE HISPANIC  COMMUNITY EVER SINCE THEY VOTED BARACK OBAMA INTO A SECOND TERM. FOR CONSERVATIVES, IT WAS A  SOBERING MOMENT. OR AT LEAST IT WOULD BE, IF I  COULD STOP DRINKING. [ LAUGHTER ] AGAIN, THANK YOU, CAPTAIN  MORGAN. BUT THE GOP LOST THE HISPANIC  VOTE BY 44 POINTS. 71% TO 27%. 11 MILLION HISPANICS VOTED FOR  OBAMA. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, IF  YOU LAID THEM ALL END TO END,  AND STACKED THEM TEN HIGH, YOU'D HAVE A PRETTY GOOD START ON A  BORDER WALL. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T GET IT: I THOUGHT  HISPANICS CAME HERE TO DO THE  JOBS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO DO, LIKE VOTING FOR THIS GUY. (  LAUGHTER  ). WHAT IS HIS NAME? IT'S GOING TO COME TO ME. HOLD ON, I'LL REMEMBER HIS NAME. ITS GOING TO COME TO ME. [ LAUGHTER ] CHIP RANCHERO? WHERE DID WE GO WRONG?! THE GOP AND HISPANICS ARE MADE  FOR EACH OTHER.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISPANIC  VOTE, IN SO MANY WAYS, IT SEEMS  IT SHOULD BE NATURAL FOR SOME OF THEM TO VOTE GOP.
HISPANICS ARE NOT INHERENTLY  LIBERAL. HISPANICS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE  TIGHT FAMILY. THEY HAVE-- YOU KNOW, THEY'RE  RELIGIOUS CATHOLIC, THEY'RE  SOCIALLY-CONSERVATIVE.
THIS OUGHT TO BE OUR VOTE. THEY'RE SOCIALLY, ECONOMICALLY  CONSERVATIVE, PATRIOTIC, CHURCH-  GOING, FAMILY-ORIENTED PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY ENTREPRENEURIAL. COALITION.
Stephen: YEAH! HISPANICS AND REPUBLICANS GO  TOGETHER LIKE BEANS AND VERY,  VERY WHITE RICE-- [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE  BEANS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GRANTED, WE CONSERVATIVES MAY  HAVE SAID A FEW NEGATIVE THINGS  ABOUT IMMIGRANTS IN THE PAST, BUT NOW ALL OF THAT IS JUST AGUA  UNDER THE SPANISH WORD FOR  BRIDGE, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE NOW REACHED OUT TO A GROUP THEY  TRUST EVEN LESS THAN MEXICANS:  DEMOCRATS.
INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS OF THE  SENATE-- FOUR FROM EACH PARTY--  SAID TODAY THEY HAVE A BREAKTHROUGH ON COMPREHENSIVE  IMMIGRATION REFORM.
THESE 11 MILLION PEOPLE NEED  TO COME OF THE SHADOWS AND WE  NEED TO GIVE THEM A PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP. WHAT'S GOING ON NOW IS  UNACCEPTABLE. WE HAVE BEEN TOO CONTENT FOR TOO  LONG TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO MOW  OUR LAWN, SERVE OUR FOOD, CLEAN OUR HOMES AND EVEN WATCH OUR  CHILDREN WHILE NOT AFFORDING  THEM ANY OF THE BENEFITS THAT MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO GREAT.
Stephen: YES, LATINO  IMMIGRANTS DESERVE THE SAME  BENEFITS-- SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, PUBLIC EDUCATION--  THAT ALL AMERICANS ARE SLOWLY  LOSING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, FOLKS, DONT THINK THIS IS  SOME BLANKET AMNESTY WITH NO  PRICE TO PAY. JUST ASK FLORIDA SENATOR AND  REGISTERED LATINO MARCO RUBIO.
YOU HAVE TO IDENTITY  YOURSELF. YOU'RE GOING TO BE  FINGERPRINTED. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A  BACKGROUND CHECK DONE.
Stephen: YES, THEY MUST BE  FINGERPRINTED, AND HAVE  BACKGROUND CHECKS. AFTER ALL, THEY'RE TRYING TO GET  CITIZENSHIP, NOT AN ASSAULT  WEAPON. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THESE PEOPLE LOVE ASSAULT  WEAPONS. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, THIS COMPLETELY CHANGES  HOW REPUBLICANS WILL BE  PERCEIVED THROUGH THE LATINO  LENS.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO REVIVE  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AMONG  HISPANICS.
IT TAKES AWAY FROM DEMOCRATS  THE RACE CARD AND IT ALSO LETS  NERVOUS WHITE VOTERS KNOW THIS IS NOT A RACIST PARTY.
THE ONE THING ABOUT IF THIS  PLAN COMES TO PASS, HOW ARE THE  DEMOCRATS GOING TO CALL REPUBLICANS RACIST ANYMORE? THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE IT OFF THE  TABLE.
Stephen: YES, REPUBLICANS  WILL TAKE RACISM OFF THE TABLE--  OR HAVE THEIR BUSBOY DO IT. [ LAUGHTER ] EITHER WAY, IT'S GONE. OF COURSE, NO SURPRISE THAT LAST  WEEK PRESIDENT OBAMA TRIED TO  JUMP ON THE MARIACHI BANDWAGON WITH HIS OWN PLAN. BUT MY FRIENDS AT FOX NEWS KNOW  WHAT QUE REALLY PASAS HERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHY DIDN'T HE JUST SAY-- HEY,  SENATE, GO FOR IT.
THIS WAS A CAMPAIGN RALLY IN  MANY WAYS.
MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT'S  NOT HELPFUL TO FLY IN AND DO A  CAMPAIGN-STYLE EVENT AND ATTACK PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING TO THE  TABLE WITH A SENSIBLE PLAN.
WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE  IT HAPPEN? IS IT FOR HIM TO REALIZE,  SOMETIMES, SILENCE IS GOLDEN?
Stephen: MEGYN KELLY'S  RIGHT-- SILENCE IS GOLDEN. THAT'S WHY I OFTEN PREFER TO  WATCH HER SHOW ON MUTE. [ LAUGHTER ] BESIDES HISPANIC VOTERS KNOW  THAT IMMIGRATION REFORM IS  MOVING FORWARD ONLY BECAUSE REPUBLICANS DECIDED TO STOP  BLOCKING IT. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE OBAMA  CREDIT FOR SUPPORTING IT ALL  ALONG. THAT WOULD BE LIKE PASSING A  KIDNEY STONE AND THANKING YOUR  DOCTOR-- INSTEAD OF THE KIDNEY STONE, FOR TAKING YOU ON SUCH A  CHARACTER-BUILDING ADVENTURE OF  AGONY! [ LAUGHTER ] GETTING THOSE WORDS OUT WAS  ALMOST LIKE PASSING A KIDNEY  STONE. [ LAUGHTER ] PLUS, WHILE OBAMA'S TRYING TO  WOO HISPANICS, HE'S ALREADY  FLIRTING WITH ANOTHER MINORITY GROUP ON THE SIDE. ACCORDING TO THE WHITE HOUSE  WEBSITE, OBAMA'S IMMIGRATION  PLAN TREATS SAME-SEX FAMILIES AS  FAMILIES. WHAT'S NEXT, MR. PRESIDEN,  TREATING GAY PEOPLE AS PEOPLE? HERE'S THE IDEA: THE PLAN  "GIVES U.S. CITIZENS AND LAWFUL  PERMANENT RESIDENTS THE ABILITY TO SEEK A VISA ON THE BASIS OF A  PERMANENT RELATIONSHIP WITH A  SAME-SEX PARTNER." THAT'S RIGHT. HE WANTS TO LET GAY FOREIGNERS  ACROSS THE BORDER TO TAKE OUR  GOOD-PAYING, AMERICAN GAYING  JOBS. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, FOLKS, I BELIEVE IN  AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM. AND THIS IS AN INSULT TO  AMERICAN GAYS. WHO I MAY NOT APPROVE OF, BUT I  BELIEVE THEY ARE THE GAYEST IN  THE WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] OUR GAY PEOPLE --  THEY ARE NOT JUST HOMOSEXUAL. THEY'RE HOMO-CEPTIONAL. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CH
