Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR THE AMOUNT OF  ENERGY YOU PUT INTO THAT  CHANTING GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE. WELCOME TO HOUR TWO OF THE  BROADCAST. NATION, YOU KNOW, I DO THIS SHOW  FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON  ONLY, TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU. AS WE SPEAK THERE'S A MASSIVE  CORPORATE CONSPIRACY TO RIP YOU  OFF THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN STRANGELY SILENT ON. FORTUNATELY ONE BRAVE NEWS  ORGANIZATION TACKLED IT HEAD ON. "THE NEW YORK POST". TODAY THEIR FRONT PAGE BLEW THE  LID OFF THE SCANDAL HONEY, THEY  SHRUNK THE FOOT LONG. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BLACK AND WHITE. TURNS OUT THAT THE SUBWAY  FOOT-LONG IS SOMETIMES 11  INCHES. WE'VE BEEN $5 FOOT WRONGED. COME ON! 12 INCHES IS 12 INCHES. I KNOW IT'S COLD OUT BUT THAT'S  NO EXCUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW -- NOW WE KNOW HOW JARED  LOST ALL THAT WEIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] HE STARVED TO DEATH. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS THIS IS AN ENORMOUS BREACH  OF TRUST, SUBWAY. ARE YOUR EMPLOYEES EVEN  CERTIFIED SANDWICH ARTISTS? HAVE THEY PASSED THE FREE ART  TEST WHERE THEY HAVE TO MAKE A  TURTLE OUT OF LUNCH MEAT? I WANT TO GIVE HATS OFF TO  REPORTERS CAYLEE AND NATALEE  O'KNEEL THE WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN OF OSCAR AND MEYER. THEY BROKE THIS THROUGH AN  INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM  TECHNIQUE KNOWN AS LUNCH. THEY PUT THIS SCAM HITCH WICH IN  PER INSPECTY SAYING IF YOU BUY A  FOOT LONG EVERY OTHER WEEK FOR A YEAR IT'S A ALSO OF $100. IT'S THE MONEY YOU'LL NEED TO  COVER THE MED CALL BILLS FROM  EATING ALL THOSE FOOT-LONGS. SUBWAY, IT'S OVER. I'M GOING TO BE KEEPING YOU  HONEST BUT MEASURING EVERY  SANDWICH BY THE MOST ACCURATE MEANS POSSIBLE THE FRUIT ABOUT  IT FOOT. YOU ARE DEALING WITH ME NOW. YOU ARE DEALING WITH ME. OF COURSE, FOLKS, PRETTY SOON  OUR SANDWICHES ARE GOING TO BE  METRIC BECAUSE AMERICA IS  FINISH. YESTERDAY OBAMA SHREDDED  CONSTITUTION AND NOINTED HIM  SELF-GUN SNATCHER THE  MAGNIFICENT. JIM?
WE'LL MAKE IT EASIER TO KEEP  GUNS OUTS OF HANDS OF CRIMINALS  BY STRENGTHENING THE BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM. WE'LL HELP SCORES HIRE RESOURCE  OFFICERS. CONGRESS SHOULD RESTORE A BAN AN  MILITARY ASSAULT WEAPONS AND TEN  ROUND LIMIT FOR MAGAZINES. THE JOWRT OF AMERICANS AGREE  WITH US ON THIS AND BY THE WAY  SO DID RONALD RAGE SPHEENCHTS TAKE A CHEAP SHOT AT RONALD  REAGAN. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO  IMPRESS JODY FOSTER? [ LAUGHTER ] THE PRESIDENT SHOULD FOCUS ON  THE STRENGTHENING THE POLL SWIZ  KNOW -- POLICIES WE KNOW MAKE US SAFE LIKE MAKING SURE NOBODY  BRINGS TWEEZERS ON TO AN  AIRPLANE. HE KNEW IT WASN'T GOING TO PASS  THE SMELL TEST SEW STOOPPED TO  SURROUNDING HIMSELF WITH  CHILDREN. LIKE THIS CONFUSED BOY, JOEY. HE LOVES TRAINS. IT WAS A TRANSPARENT APPEAL TO  OUR HUMANITY. LUCKILY RUSH LIMB BAWP DOESN'T  HAVE ANY.
OBAMA USES KIDS AS HUMAN  SHIELDS. HE BRINGSES THESE KIDS WHO  WROTE, SUPPOSEDLY, LETTERS TO  THE WHITE HOUSE AVENUETOWN TO BRING THEM UP UP THERE IF SHOW  SUPPORT AMONG THE CHILDREN. YOU'VE GOT THESE LITTLE KIDS  THERE. THEY DON'T WANT TO DIE. AND HOW CAN YOU NOT LISTEN TO  THEM?
Stephen: YOU ARE BEING  MANIPULATED, AMERICA. BOORKS-HOO I WANT -- BOO-HOO, I  WANT TO GOOD TO DISNEY LAND. I WANT TOLL GET A PONY. I WANT TO LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER  DAY. GROW UP. I WANT TO GROW UP. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THESE  ARE THE ONLY LETTERS OBAMA GETS  FROM KIDS AND SO DOES STEVE  DOOCY. HE AND HE SHOULD KNOW HE READ  IT'S THIRD GRADE LEVEL.
ONE OF KIDS SAID MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH  THE DEBT. I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE DEBT  CEILING. I UNDERSTAND WHEN I GROW UP IT  COULD BE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS  OF DOLLARS COULD YOU PLEASE CUT SPENDING NOW.
Stephen: WHY AREN'T KIDS  WRITE TOGETHER PRESIDENT ABOUT  LONG-TERM RESTRUCTURING OF GOVERNMENT DEBT. COME ON FOX NEWS YOUNGSTERS,  BENIC RON, THE REST PINECREST  RETIREMENT CREW. PUT DOWN THE SUNNY D AND FIRE UP  THE UNDERWOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] THANKFULLY, FOLKS, OUR  CONSTITUTION HAS A BUILT-IN  MECHANISM TO STOP DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED TYRANTS FROM TAKING OUR  GUNS AND THAT BRINGS US TO  TONIGHT'S WORD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] UNITED WE STAND OFF. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS ANTI-GUN  STORM TROOPERS SAY IT'S OKAY FOR  ME TO HAVE A PISTOL. IT'S OKAY FOR ME TO HAVE A RIFLE  AND A SHOTGUN. BUT IT'S NOT OKAY FOR ME TO HAVE  MILITARY-STYLE WEAPONRY. MAYBE THEY'VE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE  SECOND AMENDMENT IS.
THE FOUNDERS FEARED  GOVERNMENT TYRANNY.
THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS ABOUT  RESISTANCE TO GOVERNMENT  TYRANNY.
THEY NEVER MENTIONED HUNTING  AND DEER, THEY TALKED ABOUT  FREEDOM AND LIBERTY OVER  TYRANNY.
Stephen: DAMN STRAIGHT. LIKE ANYBODY SETTING UP A NEW  GOVERNMENT THE FOUNDERS ADDED A  CLAUSE THAT SAID IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING, FEEL FREE  TO SHOOT US. IT'S LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS LIKE  THE ULTIMATE VETO. IT'S ALMOST LIKE A  CONSTITUTIONAL PRENUP. THAT IS WHY I AND MY FRIENDS AT  FOX NEWS HAVE ALWAYS STOOD WITH  THOSE WHO ARM THEMSELVES AGAINST GOVERNMENT TYRANNY, PATRIOTS  LIKE BILL AND THE WEATHER  UNDERGROUND. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T GET ME WRONG, ITS FOUNDERS  DIDN'T -- THE FOUNDERS DIDN'T  WANT US TO ENGAGE IN ARMED INSURRECTION AT THE DROP OF A  HAT, NO -- NO, THEY KNEW IT  SHOULD BE ONLY IF SOMETHING UNIMAGINABLE HAPPENED. SOMETHING LIKE THE GOVERNMENT OF  THE UNITED STATES TURNING ON ITS  OWN CITIZENS. THAT'S WHY WE NEED WEAPONS AND  NOT SOME WEAK ASS TEN-ROUND  MAGAZINES EITHER. AS CNN CONSERVATIVE CONTRIBUTOR  PUT IT YOU MAY THINK A 30 ROUND  MAGAZINE IS TOO BIG. UNDER THE REAL PURPOSE OF THE  SECOND AMENDMENT A 30 ROUND  MAGAZINE MIGHT BE TOO SMAWSM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIGHTING THE  UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. WHEN THE SECOND AMENDMENT WAS  WRITTEN WE DIDN'T HAVE A  STANDING ARMY AND THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON IN AMERICA'S  ARSENAL WAS THE HORSE DRAWN  SMALL POX BLANKET. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT TODAY -- BUT FOLKS -- TODAY  AMERICA HAS THE WORLD'S GREATEST  MILITARY FULL OF BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN ARMED WITH THE MOST  POWERFUL WEAPONRY EVER DEVISED. IT'S BECAUSE I RESPECT OUR  TROOPS SO MUCH THAT I NEED A  FULLY AUTOMATICALLY ASSAULT RIFLE WITH A 100 ROUND MAGAZINE  TO KILL THEM WHEN THEY COME FOR  MY GUNS. BECAUSE REALISTICALLY -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- JUST THINK ABOUT THIS:  YOU  THINK THAT AR-15 IS GOING TO  SAVE YOU WHEN UNCLE COMES KNOCKING WITH AN APACHE  HELICOPTER? [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, NOW IF THE SECOND AMENDMENT  IS TRULY TO DEFEND OURSELVES  AGAINST GOVERNMENT COURSE, THEN CITIZENS WILL NEVER BE SAFE  UNTIL WE CAN HAVE OUR OWN  AIRCRAFT CARRIERS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, I KNOW WHAT SOME OUT THERE  ARE SAYING, MIGHT SOME DERANGED  INDIVIDUAL TAKE THEIR CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED  AIRCRAFT CARRIER TO A MALL LET'S  SAY AND RAIN HELL FIRE MISSILES DOWN ON A CINNABON FOR SKIMPING  ON THE FROSTING? WELL, OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S NO STOPPING THAT. BUT AS JEFFERSON SAID SOMETIMES  THE TREE OF LIBERTY MUST BE  WATERED BY THE BLOOD OF THE  INNOCENT. LOOK IT UP. SO MR. KING PRESIDENT, UNLESS  YOU AND THE ANTI-GUN BRIGADE  WILL ADMIT THAT WE GUN OWNERS ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED  THE RIGHT TO HAVE ANY WEAPON WE  WANT, WE'LL USE EVERY WEAPON WE CAN GET TO KEEP EVERY WEAPON WE  HAVE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
