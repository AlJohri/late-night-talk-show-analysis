Stephen:  MOSTLY HANG OUT AT THE GRAMMYS, YOU KNOW, STUFF LIKE THAT. YOU, OF COURSE, P.BEAUTIFULLY WITH KID ROCK.
I HAVE, INDEED.
Stephen:  AT THE RALLY TO RESTORE... THAT JON AND I DID. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  THAT WAS FUN. OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW YOU FROM YOUR MUSIC CAREER.
YEAH.
Stephen:  OKAY, YOU ARE A NINE-TIME GRAMMY AWARD WINNER. YOU'VE SOLD MORE THAN 50 MILLION ALBUMS WORLDWIDE. MICHAEL JACKSON CAN KISS YOUR ASS. THAT'S INSANE.
I'M SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HIM.
Stephen:  I KNOW. WHY HAVE YOU DONE SO MUCH? AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR CAREER YOU TOLD US ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS HAVE FUN. ISN'T THAT CLEARLY A LIE? DON'T YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE WORK ETHIC?
NO, NOT AT ALL YOU.
Stephen:  STILL WANT TO HAVE FUN?
I STILL WANT TO HAVE FUN.
Stephen:  YOU WANT TO GET DRUNK IN THE MORNING?
THAT'S TRUE. I HAVE TWO LITTLE KIDS. THEY'RE USED TO IT, THOUGH.
Stephen:  WELL, YOU LOOK GOOD FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAKES AND BAKES.
I HAVE A CRACK TEAM THAT WORKS 24 HOURS A DAY TO GET ME LOOKING LIKE THIS.
Stephen:  CAN YOU GIVE ME THEIR NUMBER?
YOU DON'T NEED IT.
Stephen:  THANK YOU. YOU'RE A GOOD GUEST. RIGHT NOW, THIS IS YOUR EIGHTH STUDIO ALBUM.
IT IS.
Stephen:  IT'S CALLED "FEELS LIKE HOME." IT IS A COUNTRY ALBUM FOR YOU.
IT IS.
Stephen:  YOU'RE A GIANT ROCK STAR. WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO STEAL JOBS HAVE YOU HEARD THEIR LYRICS? THEY'VE HAD TERRIBLE LIVES. IT'S BEEN HARD ENOUGH ON THEM-- THEIR WIFE HAS LEFT THEM AND THEIR DOG IS DEAD.
TWO THINGS-- A LOT OF DRINKING IN COUNTRY. PEOPLE WRITE ABOUT DRINKING. AND SECONDLY, THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY...
Stephen:  REALLY? LET'S PLAY UP THAT. THEY DON'T PLAY UP THE MONEY AS MUCH. NO. THEY NEVER SAY, "MAKE IT RAIN." ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING OF A DEPARTURE FOR YOU, OR DID YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE A COUNTRY STAR?
YOU KNOW, BRAD PAISLEY-- I'M GOING TO DROP A NAME-- HE SAID YOU NEED TO MAKE A RECORD IN THIS FORMAT. LET'S MAKE THIS STORY TO THE POINT. IN POP AND ROCK, YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR LYRICS A LITTLE NEBULOUS. BUT IN COUNTRY, YOU TELL A STORY. SO --
Stephen:  I LOVE THAT BRAD PAISLEY. THE SONG OF HIS WITH LL COOL JAY. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT ONE?
I DO.
Stephen:  DID YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENTAL MISOGYNIST ON IT?
NO, NO WE DON'T.
Stephen:  YOU'RE ALSO A BET OF AN ACTIVIST, AREN'T YOU?
I AM.
Stephen:  IN 2003 IN AGREEMENT YOU WON A SHIRT THAT SAID NO WAR. ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY ABOUT OUR POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT IN SYRIA.
I'M A LOVER NORTH A FIGHTER. I DON'T THINK WAR SEAVER THE ANSWER. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. THINK ABOUT WORLD WAR II AND HOW YOU WOULD HAVE APPEASED HITLER? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ). CHERYL, I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WOULD YOU SING A SONG FOR US?
I'D LOVE TO.
THIS IS A PERFORMANCE BY SHERYL CROWE.
