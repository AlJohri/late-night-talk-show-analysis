(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS S KNOWN AS  THE LATINO WALTER CRONKITE. I WILL BEGIN ALL OF MY QUESTIONS  WITH AN UP SIDE DOWN QUESTION  MARK. (LAUGHTER)  PLEASE WELCOME JORGE RAMOS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANKS. JORGE, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
THANKS FOR INVITING ME.
Stephen: EL YOU'RE WELCOME. (LAUGHTER)  YOU'RE A JOURNALIST, YOU'RE A  COLUMNIST IN, AN AUTHOR AND,  SINCE 1986 YOU'RE THE ANCHORMAN FOR NOTICIERO UNIVISION. OKAY, SO YOU'RE THE BIG ANCHOR  FOR THE LATIN SPEAKERS IN  AMERICA.
UH-HUH.
Dave: YOU-- IS THE LATINO OR  HISPANIC-- IS THAT THE SAME  THING?
USUALLY YOU USE HISPANIC FOR  THOSE ON THE EAST COAST AND  LATINO FOR THE WEST COAST BUT IT  DOESN'T MATTER.
Stephen: SO IT'S LIKE AN EAST  COAST/WEST COAST KIND OF GANG.
YEAH BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
Stephen: I WANT TO MAKE SURE  I'M NOT THROWING ANY SIGNS  TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  IS THE HISPANIC VOTE STILL IN  PLAY?
NOT REALLY. I JUST SAY THE LATEST POLL FROM  LATINO DECISIONS AND 73% OF  LATINOS TEND TO BE-- THEY SAID  THEY'LL BE VOTING FOR PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. ABOUT 21% FOR MITT ROMNEY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  MOSTLY LATINOS TEND TO VOTE FOR  DEMOCRATS, NOT REPUBLICANS.
Stephen: BUT WHY? ROMNEY'S FATHER WAS BORN IN  MEXICO! (LAUGHTER)  HE'S A LATINO!
HE WAS BORN IN-- YOU KNOW, I  ASKED HIM IF HE WAS A LATINO AND  HE TOLD ME NO. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE A LITTLE  TOO MUCH IF HE'S DOING ONLY 21%. HE WOULD BE DOING 15% OR 16%.
Stephen: HE DID HIS BEST TO  APPEAR LATINO WHEN HE WAS THERE. JIMMY, CAN WE PUT UP THE PICTURE  HERE? ON THE LEFT HERE IS ROMNEY WHEN  HE WAS IN MIAMI TWO DAYS BEFORE. ON THE RIGHT IS WHEN HE WAS  TALKING WITH YOU ON UNIVISION.
THAT IS TRUE BUT THE  NUMBERS-- HE SPENT A FEW DAYS IN  FLORIDA SO THAT CHANGES  EVERYTHING. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: HE WAS APPARENTLY  CAMPAIGNING IN A NUCLEAR  REACTOR. (LAUGHTER)  WHICH CANDIDATE-- YOU ALSO DO  ANALYSIS, RIGHT? WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD BE BETTER  FOR THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY?
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT  PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SUPPORTED  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  REFORM. THAT'S GIVING 11 MILLION  IMMIGRANTS A PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP.
Stephen: HE SAID HE WOULD DO  THAT.
HE BROKE A PROMISE.
Stephen:
AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT IT.
Stephen: THIS IS PAYBACK  TIME.
I ASKED HIM WHY HE BROKE THE  PROMISE AND HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T  HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE  REPUBLICANS. BUT A PROMISE IS A PROMISE, I  TOLD HIM. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE TO  SAY THAT GOVERNOR ROMNEY HE  LIKED THIS IDEA OF  SELF-DEPORTATION.
Stephen: SPEAKING SPANISH
HE SAID HE THOUGHT IT WOULD  BE A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE  COUNTRY WHEN IT COMES TO  VERIFYING THE IDENTIFICATION OF  EMPLOYEES.
Stephen: ISN'T THAT  EMPOWERING FOR THE LATINO  COMMUNITY TO SAY "YOU HAVE THE  POWER TO DEPORT YOURSELF. I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. IT'S A MATTER OF TRUST.
NOT EXACTLY. I'VE SPOKEN WITH THOUSANDS OF  IMMIGRANTS AND I HAVEN'T FOUND A  SINGLE ONE OF THEM WHO WANTS TO  SELF-DEPORT. (LAUGHTER)  I THINK SELF-DEPORTATION IS NOT  A SOLUTION, IT'S A REALLY,  REALLY BAD IDEA. IT'S ABOUT WELCOMING IMMIGRANTS,  NOT ABOUT THROWING THEM OUT. (APPLAUSE)
ROMNEY'S RIGHT. YOU GUYS ARE LIKE THE 47% WHO  ARE DEPENDING ON THE GOVERNMENT  TO DEPORT PEOPLE. IS THAT WHY YOU LIKE OBAMA  BECAUSE OBAMA HAS SUPPORTED A  TON OF YOU PEOPLE. -- DEPORT ADD TON OF YOU PEOPLE.
WELL, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA  HAS DEPORTED MORE IMMIGRANTS  THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN THE  HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen: SO YOU GET A FREE  RIDE TO THE BORDER. (LAUGHTER)
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS  IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTE MUCH MORE  TO THIS COUNTRY THAN WHAT PEOPLE  MIGHT THINK. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS PAY  TAXES AND DO THE JOBS--
THEY ARE CRIMINALS, THEY'RE  ILLEGALS. THEY BROKE THE LAW. YOU KNOW THE LAW? THEY BROKE THE LAW. IF YOU BREAK THE LAW YOU'RE A  CRIMINAL, JORGE.
AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE  MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO  BENEFIT FROM THEIR WORK AND  THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN COMPANIES WHO HIRE THEM. AND WE DON'T CALL THEM ILLEGAL  SO WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT  CO-RESPONSIBILITY. THEY ARE HERE BECAUSE WE BENEFIT  FROM THE WORK. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I DON'T HAVE A  COMEBACK FOR THAT SO THEY'LL  EDIT IT OUT OF THE INTERVIEW. (LAUGHTER)
WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY HARVEST  THE FOOD THAT WE HAVE FOR  BREAKFAST AND FOR LUNCH. THEY'RE BUILDING THE HOMES WHERE  WE LIVE. THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR KIDS. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM  A SOLUTION. SELF-DEPORTATION IS NOT A  SOLUTION.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE  SOLUTION? WAVE A MAGIC WAND AND EVERYBODY  GETS TO STAY?
WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  REFORM.
Stephen: AMNESTY?
IT'S NOT AN AMNESTY BECAUSE  THEY WOULD GO TO THE BACK OF THE  LINE. BUT THEY ARE HERE BECAUSE WE  NEED THEM AND THEY CAME HERE  SIMPLY BECAUSE WE ARE HIRING  THEM. WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE.
Stephen: LET ME GET ONE MORE  STAB FOR YOU GUYS TO VOTE  REPUBLICAN. YOU GUYS LIKE GEORGE W. BUSH. YOU LIKED HIM. WHY NOT ROMNEY?
HE GOT 44% OF THE HISPANIC  VOTE BUT HE WAS THE FIRST U.S. PRESIDENT WHO THOUGHT-THE-THAT  HE SPOKE SPANISH. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HE THOUGHT HE SPOKE  ENGLISH, TOO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  JORGE RAMOS, THANK YOU SO MUCH! JORGE RAMOS, UNIVISION, WE'LL BE  RIGHT BACK.
