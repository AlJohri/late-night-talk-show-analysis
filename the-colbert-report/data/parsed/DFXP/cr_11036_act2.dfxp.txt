Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. NOW, LONGTIME VIEWERS-- FOLKS, LONGTIME VIEWERS OF MY WRIST WILL KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN WEARING THIS RED BRACELET FOR SEVEN YEARS. IT'S PART OF MY WRISTSTRONG CAMPAIGN IN WHICH I SINGLE WRISTEDLY RAISED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR THE YELLOW RIBBON FUND, WHICH ASSISTS INJURED SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S A PERFECT FIT.   ( APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE I BELIEVE NOTHING SAYS YELLOW RIBBON LIKE RED BRACELETS. WHEN THE IRAQ WAR ENDED IN 2010, I TOOK ONE WRISTSTRONG BRACELET OFF, AND NOW I CAN TAKE THE LAST ONE OFF.
THIS MORNING A MILESTONE IN THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN. THE UNITED STATES AND NATO OFFICIALLY ENDED THEIR COMBAT MISSION.
IN AFGHANISTAN, THE U.S. AND NATO OFFICIALLY CLOSED THEIR COMBAT MISSION AFTER MORE THAN 13 YEARS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. BOOM! NOW, I AM-- I AM SORRY THAT OUR TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN ARE NOT GETTING A PARADE LIKE THE ONE THE IRAQ VETERANS DIDN'T GET. I DON'T KNOW THE PROBLEM. THERE MUST BE A WORLDWIDE CONFETTI SHORTAGE. SO BEFORE I GO OFF THE AIR, I'M GOING TO RAISE A LITTLE MORE GREEN ONE LAST TIME FOR THE YELLOW RIBBON FUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). TONIGHT, I AM RAFFLING OFF PARTS OF MY SET. STEVE, TELL THEM WHAT THEY COULD WIN.
WELL, STEPHEN, THE FIRST-PLACE WINNER WILL TAKE HOME THE ACTUAL STEPHEN COLBERT DESK, MADE OF 100% GENUINE MATERIAL. THIS TIMELESS CLASSIC IS SHAPED LIKE A GIANT "C," OR A SEVERELY MISSHAPEN "U." THIS VERY DESK WITNESSED THE COUNTLESS HISTORIC MOMENTS ON THE "COLBERT REPORT," SUCH AS THE TIME STEPHEN COLBERT ANNOUNCED THIS RAFFLE.
THANKS, STEVE, THAT SOUNDS LIKE--
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. THE SECOND-PLACE WINNER UPON TAKE HOME THIS BEAUTIFUL THE "COLBERT REPORT" FAKE FIREPLACE, FEATURING EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE-- A GENUINE FAUX MARBLE MANTEL. A BUTTER SOFT AND BUTTER-STAINED LEATHER ARMCHAIR, AND 40-INCH FLATRON STANDARD DEPTH DISPLAY WITH ALONG VIDEO OF A ROARING FIRE. OH, MY GOD! I'M ON FIRE! I'M IN HELL! AH! IT BURNS! IT BURNS!
Stephen:  THANKS STEVE. TO WIN GO TO OMAZE.COM/COLBERT, AND YOU'LL BE ENTERED IN THE RAFFLE FOR EVERY $10 YOU DONATE. THE MORE YOU DONATE, THE MORE CHANCES YOU HAVE TO WIN. REMEMBER, IT'S ALL FOR A GOOD CAUSE, BECAUSE THE MONEY WILL BE SPLIT EQUALLY BETWEEN THE YELLOW RIBBON FUND, AND OUR FRIENDS AT DONORS CHOOSE. BEST OF ALL, YOU'LL BE HELPING ME CLEAR OUT MY STUDIO BEFORE NEXT THURSDAY OR I DON'T GET MY SECURITY DEPOSIT BACK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
