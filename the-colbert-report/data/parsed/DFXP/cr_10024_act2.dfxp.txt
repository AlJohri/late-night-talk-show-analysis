Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, NATION, IF YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING ITS SHOW LATELY THEN YOU KNOW LAST WEEK I BROUGHT YOU SOME SHOCKING NEWS ABOUT CRACK-SMOKING TORONTO MAYOR AND POSSESSED CABBAGE PATCH DOLL ROB FORD. WELL, FOLKS, FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I'M AWARE OF DRUG ABUSE HAS HAD SOME NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.
THE BOMBSHELL IS SO BAD THAT EVEN-- HOW STRANGE IS THIS, FORD MOTOR COMPANY SAYS IT'S COSTING THEM BUSINESS. THE CAR COMPANY SAYS THEY'RE DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE MAYOR. THE ICONIC FORD LOGO WAS BEING USED BY ROB FORD SUPPORTERS ON T-SHIRTS. THE COMPANY SAYS THE USE SUN AUTHORIZED, OBVIOUSLY, AND THEY'RE NOW ASKING SHIRTMAKERS TO STOP USING IT.
Stephen: BIG MISTAKE, FORD. ROB FORD COULD HELP YOU REACH OUT TO A LUCRATIVE NEW MARKET, BECAUSE AFTER ALL THERE IS NO PRODUCT WITH MORE CUSTOMER LOYALTY THAN CRACK. FORD APOLOGIZED LAST WEEK AND I THINK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF IT. BUT APPARENTLY THE MAYOR'S CRITICS CANNOT TAKE I SMOKED CRACK FOR AN ANSWER. INSTEAD THEY MADE EVEN MORE ALARMING ALLEGATIONS.
MAYOR FORD WAS SAID TO BE SNORTING COCAINE, DRINKING VODKA AND USING OXYCONTIN ALL WHILE ENTERTAINING A PROSTITUTE IN HIS OFFICE.
DRINKING AND DRIVING ALSO A PROBLEM POLICE SAY. THEY SAY THAT ONE STAFF MEMBER SAID THAT HE WAS IN THE CAR WITH THE MAYOR WHEN THE MAYOR CHUGGED A MICKEY OF VODKA MIXED IN WITH SOME GATORADE.
MAYOR FORD THEN STEPS OUT OF THE CAR AND PROCEEDS TO URINATE PUBLICLY NEXT TO BASICALLY AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
Stephen: O KWAN DAB, HE WAS JUST TRYING TO TELL KIDS TO STAY IN SCHOOL. SERIOUSLY, KIDS, STAY INSIDE, THE MAYOR'S OUT THERE. NOW FORD HAS DECLARED THAT HE IS NOT RESIGNING. EVEN THOUGH THE TORONTO CITY COUNCIL HAS ASKED HIM TO STEP DOWN IT HAS NO LEGAL MEANS TO REMOVE FORD FROM OFFICE. ACCORDING TO CANADIAN LAW THE ON ONES WITH THE POWER TO ARREST THE MAYOR ARE THE QUEEN AND WAYNE GRETZKY. BUT THAT'S IT. THERE IT IS, MAYOR FORD IS DONE EMBARRASSING TORONTO IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA.
THE ALSO THING WAS OLIVIA GONDAK SAYS I WANT TO EAT HER [BLEEP]. I NEVER SAID IN IN HER LIFE TO HER. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT I'M HAPPILY MARRIED. I'VE GOT MORE THAN ENOUGH TO EAT AT HOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: WOW S IT VALENTINE'S DAY ALREADY? KIND OF MAKES YOU NOSTALGIC TO THE CRACK NOW, DOESN'T IT TORONTO. WE'VE BE RIGHT BACK.
