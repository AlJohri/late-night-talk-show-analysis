Stephen: STEPHEN, WELCOME  BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, I PLAY MANY ROLES IN MY  FAMILY: I'M A FATHER, I'M A  HUSBAND, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I'M A COMMUTER. [LAUGHTER] AND MY CAR IS ONE OF THE PLACES  PEOPLE LOOK TO ME TO SET AN  EXAMPLE. IF SOMEBODY CUTS ME OFF IN  TRAFFIC, WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING  TO DO? DO I RAM THEM? [LAUGHTER] OR TAKE THE HIGH ROAD --  DOUBLE GUNS. [LAUGHTER] BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, I'M NOT  PROUD OF THIS,  BUT EVEN I AM GUILTY OF SOME  UGLY HIGHWAY STEREOTYPING. I SPEAK, OF COURSE, ABOUT MY  PREJUDICE AGAINST AXE-WEILDING  HITCHHIKERS. [LAUGHTER] I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES  I'VE ROLLED UP MY WINDOWS AND  SPED PAST A HOBO SHARPENING A HATCHET--  AND NOT EVEN CONSIDERED PICKING  HIM UP. BUT I'VE COME TO REALIZE THE  ERROR OF MY WAYS AFTER SEEING  THIS NEWS STORY ABOUT A YOUNG MAN NAMED KAI. HE SHOWED ME THAT AXE-WIELDING  HITCHHIKERS ARE PEOPLE, TOO. PEOPLE WHO SOMETIMES STOP MADMEN  LOOSE ON CALIFORNIA'S FREEWAYS. KAI TOLD THE STORY OF ONE DRIVER  WHO PICKED HIM UP TO KMPH,  FRESNO'S NEWS LEADER.
WELL, I WAS IN THE  PASSENGER'S SIDE OF THIS (BLEEP)  CAR. AND, HE COMES OVER ON THERE  COMES DRIVING DOWN THIS WAY,  HE'S LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I COME TO REALIZE I'M JESUS CHRIST  AND I CAN DO ANYTHING I (BLEEP)  WANT TO."  AND, "WATCH THIS!"  BAM! AND HE SMASHED INTO SOME (BLEEP)  GUY AND PINNED RIGHT THERE  BETWEEN THAT (BLEEP) TRUCK. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: YES, THE DRIVER SAID  HE WAS JESUS AND PLOWED INTO A  WORKER FROM A POWER COMPANY. FOLKS, THIS IS WHY THE LORD IS  YOUR CO-PILOT, NOT BEHIND THE  WHEEL. [LAUGHTER] NOW, NORMALLY, IF A DRIVER  CLAIMS TO BE JESUS, POLICE WILL  PULL HIM OVER AND MAKE HIM WALK A STRAIGHT LINE ON WATER. [LAUGHTER] BUT THE COPS HADN'T ARRIVE YET,  SO A BYSTANDER RAN OVER TO HELP.
HE JUST KEPT SAYING HE WAS  JESUS CHRIST, AND HE WAS GOING  TO SAVE ALL OF US, WE JUST HAVE TO GET--  HE USED THE "N" WORD, MEANING  BLACK PEOPLE AND THAT-- HE SAID  WE NEED TO GET THEM OFF OF THE  EARTH. HE PUT ME IN A BEAR HUG AND  STARTED BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF  ME.
Stephen: OK, I THINK IT'S  SAFE TO ASSUME TWO THINGS. ONE, THAT THIS DRIVER ISN'T  REALLY JESUS. [LAUGHTER] AND TWO, NOT A PACKERS FAN. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO KAI, OUR HITCHHIKER WITH THE  AXE, WHO I WILL REMIND YOU IS  THE HERO OF THIS STORY, SPRANG INTO ACTION.
AND THEN (BLEEP) BUDDY GETS  OUT AND THESE TWO WOMEN ARE  TRYING TO HELP HIM. HE  RUNS UP AND HE GRABS ONE OF  THEM, MAN. LIKE A GUY THAT BIG CAN SNAP A  WOMAN'S NECK LIKE A PENCIL  STICK. SO I (BLEEP) RAN UP BEHIND HIM  WITH A HATCHET-- SMASH,  SMASH,  SUH-MASH! YEAH. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: YEAH! THANKS TO KAI, THE MAN HIT BY  THE CAR IS OKAY, THE BYSTANDER  IS OKAY, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, PEOPLE ARE SAYING,  "BOY, WE SURE ARE LUCKY THAT  HOMELESS HITCHHIKER WAS CARRYING A HATCHET." [LAUGHTER] AND THIS SITUATION COULD HAVE  HAPPENED TO ANY OF US. REMEMBER, KAI SAID THE DRIVER  "CAME TO REALIZE" HE WAS JESUS  IN THE MIDDLE OF DRIVING. WHO KNOWS WHEN I'LL REALIZE IT? [LAUGHTER] AND WHEN I DO, I'M GOING TO WANT  SOMEBODY LIKE KAI IN MY  PASSENGER'S SEAT BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO.
I'M LIKE, "BRO, IF YOU'RE  (BLEEP) JESUS CHRIST, I'LL BE  THE ANTI-CHRIST, MAN, LIKE (BLEEP) THAT (BLEEP)." [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: KAI HERE, OF COURSE,  IS QUOTING SCRIPTURE. MATTHEW  24:5, WHICH READS: "FOR MANY WILL COME IN MY NAME,  CLAIMING, 'I AM THE CHRIST,' AND  WILL DECEIVE MANY. THEN ONE WILL BE LIKE, 'BRO, IF  YOU'RE (BLEEP) JESUS CHRIST,  I'LL BE THE ANTI-CHRIST, MAN, (BLEEP) THAT (BLEEP).'" [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO, NATION, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO  PICK UP AXE-WIELDING HOMELESS  HITCHHIKERS WHENEVER YOU SEE  THEM. [LAUGHTER] I JUST WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING  MORE WE COULD DO TO THANK THIS  HITCHHIKER.
IF ANYBODY'S WATCHING THIS  SOMEWHERE AND THEY'VE GOT A  MINI-MAL THEY COULD LEND A GUY WITH A WET SUIT, I'D LOVE TO  TEST OUT MAVERICKS. SO IF YOU'VE GOT A MINI-MAL AND  A WETSUIT, GET IN TOUCH WITH  HIM. HIS NAME IS KAI. HE'S SOMEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND HE HAS A HATCHET. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
