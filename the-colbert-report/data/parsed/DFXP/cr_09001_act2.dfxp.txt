WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,  THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU  CHECKED THE PAPERS BUT TODAY  IS THE LAST DAY OF THE  U.N.'S ANNUAL GENERAL  ASSEMBLY. NOW I'M TO FAN OF THE UNITED  NATIONS BUT ALLOW ME TO TAKE  A MOMENT HERE TO SAY TO THE  VISITING DIPLOMATS IN ONE OF YOUR MANY EXOTIC TONGUES IT  (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)  NOW FOLKS,  (APPLAUSE)  WHEN THE CLOWN SHOW HERE ROLLS INTO TOWN, SOME OF THE  CLOWNS GETTING OUT OF THE  CAR ARE SCARIER THAN OTHERS. JIM?
THE PRESIDENTS OF IRAN  MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD IS IN  NEW YORK. HE'S AT THE UNITED NATION.
PROTESTORS ARE CONSTANTLY  FOLLOWING AHMADINEJAD IN HIS  MASSIVE ENTOURAGE OF 140  PEOPLE.
WHY ON EARTH IS HE EVEN  HERE LET ALONE WITH  SOMETHING LIKE 140 PEOPLE IN  HIS ENTOURAGE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,  AMERICA'S CASUAL FRIDAY  NEMESIS MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD-I  HEART NEW YORK-IJAD WAS HERE WITH A 140 PERSON ENTOURAGE. AND JUST LIKE HBO'S  ENTOURAGE, IT'S ALL ABOUT  SUBJUGATING WOMEN. (LAUGHTER)  THAT REMINDED ME, THAT  REMINDED ME  (APPLAUSE)  BUT FOLKS, THEY DIDN'T JUST  COME HERE SO MAHMOUD COULD SWING SOME ANTI-SEMITIC SPID  EL AT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. NO, THEY'RE IN NEW YORK  CITY. THEY WANT TO SEE THE SIGHTS. AND IN NEW YORK THAT CAN  ONLY MEAN THE HARLEM COSTCO. (LAUGHTER)  WHERE THE IRANIAN DELEGATION  HAS BEEN SPOTTED STOCKING UP  ON WHOLESALE SHAMPOOS. NATION, THEY ARE SEEKING TO  SPLIT THE ATOM AND NOW THEY  CAN PREVENT SPLIT ENDS. HOW COULD OBAMA LET THIS  HAPPEN! THE IRANIANS WERE AT COSTCO  BECAUSE TOUGH ECONOMIC  SANCTIONS HAVE MADE IT  DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET HOLD OF FOREIGN GOODS OR  IMPORTED PRODUCTS. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THEIR  LEADER HAS TO WEAR MEMBERS  ONLY JACKETS FROM 1982. (LAUGHTER)  SO FOLKS, FOLKS, AT COSTCO  WE HAVE GIVEN THEM  UNFETTERED ACCESS TO  AMERICA'S FAMILY PACK  TECHNOLOGY. WE'LL NEVER CRIPPLE THEIR  REGIME WITH ECONOMIC  ISOLATION NOW THAT THEY HAVE  THEIR OWN 200 COUNT BOXES OF ECONOMY SIZED ADVIL AND BULK  BINS OF NUTTER BUTTER AND  GREAT SHRINK WRAP RAFTS OF  SHRIMP CUP O NOODLES. YOU MADMEN, THEY WILL BE  ABLE TO HIDE THEIR NUCLEAR  FACILITIES INSIDE THEIR  GIANT DISCARDED BARRELS OF KIRKLAND COLESLAW. (LAUGHTER)  OH! OH, DON'T WORRY!, DON'T  WORRY, YOU SAY, THEY DON'T  HAVE ENRICHED URANIUM YET. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE  COSTCO SELLS? YELLOW CAKE. (LAUGHTER)  A FIVE POUND BOX FOR 10.85. FOR 10.85 IF YOU DON'T MAKE  NUKES YOU'RE LOSING MONEY. FOLKS, THESE MANIACS MAY  DENY THE HOLOCAUST, BUT WE  HAVE JUST LAID THE GROUND  FOR A HOLOCAUSTCO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
