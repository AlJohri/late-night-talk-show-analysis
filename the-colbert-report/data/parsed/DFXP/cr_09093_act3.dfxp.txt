( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS KNOWN AS THE  GODFATHER OF PUNK. FINE, AS LONG AS SOMEONE IS  RAISING IT IN A RELIGIOUS  HOUSEHOLD. PLEASE WELCOME IGGY POP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). IGGY, HEY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  COMING ON. GOOD TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT, MR. POP. AS I SAID KNOWN AS THE GODFATHER  OF PUNK. AND THE STOOGES WERE KNOWN IN  THE '60s AND '70s FOR YOUR  MUSIC AND YOUR RAMBUNCTIOUS  BEHAVIOR. SOME OF THE SONGS PEOPLE KNOW  SEARCH AND DESTROY, LUST FOR  LIFE. YOU'RE IN THE ROCK'N'ROLL HALL  OF FAME. NOW YOU HAVE A NEW ALBUM CALLED  READY TO DIE.
THAT'S ALL TRUE. Stephen: THAT'S ALL TRUE. OKAY. WHEN YOU STARTED YOUR MUSIC,  THERE WAS NO WORD CALLED PUNK. YOU WEREN'T TRYING TO BE A PUNK  BAND. YOU JUST HAD A BAND. WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO?
TRYING TO BE FREE. YOU KNOW, HIGH SCHOOL WAS LIKE  COLLEGE WAS LIKE MILITARY WAS  LIKE VAUDEVILLE WAS LIKE BEING LOCKED UP WAS LIKE EVERYTHING  WAS JUST GOING TO BE MORE THE  ENDLESS SAME AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO OBEY. WE WANTED TO JUST...
Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE  CAUSING TROUBLE.
YEAH. Stephen: YOU LOOK LIKE  TROUBLE. YOU LOOK LIKE TROUBLE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT THAT WAY  Stephen: I DON'T THINK  ANYBODY WANTS TO HEAR, "MOM, DAD, THIS IS IGGY. WE'RE IN LOVE."  YOU LOOK LIKE TROUBLE.
I WAS 19. I GOT MY FIRST MUG SHOT.
Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU DOING? WELL, I FELL ASLEEP AT THE  WHEEL.
Stephen: IT APPARENTLY HAS A  HAPPY ENDING.
IT WORKED OUT. Stephen: YEAH. FOR EVERYBODY OR JUST YOU?
IT WASN'T MY CAR. I DROVE IT. IT WENT OFF AN EMBANKMENT INTO A  CHRISTMAS TREE ORCHARD. AND IT ACTUALLY...
Stephen: YOU HATE SANTA. THERE WERE ALL THESE LITTLE  PINE NEEDLES COVERING THE WHOLE  CAR THE NEXT MORNING. THE OWNER WAS UPSET.
Stephen: YOU WERE A DETROIT  ROCKER AT FIRST, RIGHT?
YES. Stephen: THAT MOTOWN SOUND  LIKE THE SUPREMES, YOU KNOW,  THAT RICH KIND OF TIGHT HARMONIES, SYNCHRONIZED DANCING? THAT STUFF IS GREAT.
BUT I'M JUST A SIMPLE KID. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW. SO I DID WHAT I COULD.
Stephen: WHEN DID YOU START  TAKING OFF HERE? FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR  WEARING ALMOST A SHIRT TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THANK YOU. WHY DID YOU FIRST START TAKING  OFF YOUR SHIRT WHEN PERFORMING.
THE PHARAOH NEVER WORE A  SHIRT.
Stephen: I'M SORRY. THE PHARAOH OF EGYPT NEVER  WORE A SHIRT.
Stephen: YEAH. HE ALSO WORE LIKE A...
I WORE SKIRTS FROM TIME TO  TIME, SARONGS.
Stephen: A SARONGS. OR LITTLE UNDERWEAR. Stephen: WHEN YOU PERFORM AT  THIS POINT, COULD YOU WEAR A  SHIRT OR WOULD YOUR BODY REJECT IT LIKE A BAD ORGAN?
IT REJECTS IT. I TRY. I THINK ABOUT IT. THEN IT JUST REJECTS IT. IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: WHO DO YOU... YOU  SAY YOU'RE IN THE ROCK'N'ROLL  HALL OF FAME. WHO DID YOU LOOK UP TO AS  AMUSEICAL MENTOR BECAUSE THEY  SAY THE BEATLES WANTED TO SOUND LIKE A BEACH BOYS FOR A WHILE  AND WHO WAS THAT FOR YOU?
THERE WAS A GUY NAMED LINK  RAY WHEN I WAS IN THE STUDENT  UNION ONE DAY OF THIS MAJOR UNIVERSITY AND I HEARD THIS  MUSIC. IT WAS CALLED RUMBLE. AND IT SOUNDED BAD.
Stephen: YOU WANTED TO SOUND  BAD?
I LEFT SCHOOL EMOTIONALLY AT  THAT MOMENT. THE MOMENT I HEARD RUMBLE.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK YOU  ACHIEVED IT? DO YOU THINK YOU ACHIEVED WHAT  YOU WANTED TO BE OR ARE YOU  PRESENTLY STILL ACHIEVING WHAT YOU WANTED TO BE?
I ACHIEVED IT SOME TIME AGO  AND THEN I HAD TO PAY A BIG  PRICE SORT OF LIKE PRISON OR  SOMETHING.
Stephen: LIKE PRISON OR  PRISON?
LIKE PRISON. LIKE PRISON.
Stephen: WILL YOU COME BACK  JUST AFTER THE COMMERCIAL BREAK  AND SHOW US HOW YOU ACHIEVED IT.
I WOULD LOVE TO DO IT. Stephen: IGGY, THANK YOU SO  MUCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A  PERFORMANCE BY IGGY AND THE  STOOGES.
