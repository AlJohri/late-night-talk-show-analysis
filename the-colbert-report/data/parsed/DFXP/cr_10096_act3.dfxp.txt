Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE DIRECTOR OF "SPY KIDS" AND "FROM DUSK TILL DAWN." I'LL TALK TO HIM FROM 11:53 TO 11:59. PLEASE WELCOME ROBERT RODRIGUEZ. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). MR. RODRIGUEZ, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
HOW YOU DOING?
Stephen:  NOW, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE THE WRITER, DIRECTOR, PRODUCER, EDITOR, CHOREOGRAPHER--
SOMETIMES COOK.
Stephen:  SOMETIMES COOK? ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU A GOOD COOK? ALL RIGHT? YOU'VE BEEN MAKING MOVIES FOR OVER 20 YEARS. EL MARIACHI YOUR FIRST MOVIE. $7,000 TO MAKE THAT MOVIE?
THAT'S A LOT WHEN YOU'RE A COLLEGE KID.
Stephen:  I KNOW. HOW DID YOU GET $7,000 AS A COLLEGE KID? I SOLD MY BODY TO SCIENCE.
Stephen:  REALLY. WERE YOU A BLOOD DONOR?
I WAS A LAB RAT. THEY TOOK A BUNCH OUT OF MY ARM, CUT IT OUT AT THE END AND I GOT $2,000 IN SEVEN DAYS.
Stephen:  DID THE SPEED HEALER WORK?
NO.
Stephen:  I WAS HOPING YOU COULD BE WOLVERINE NOW.
IT NEVER CAME OUT ON THE MARKET SO I DON'T THINK THEY PERFECTED IT.
Stephen:  EVERYBODY  KNOWS YOU FROM "FROM DUSK TILL DAWN," AND "SPY KIDS." YOU'VE NOW GOT YOUR OWN CABLE TV NEW YORK CALLED EL RAY. EL RAY. OKAY. I FIND IT AND YOU THREATENING. ( LAUGHTER ).
I UNDERSTAND.
Stephen:  BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT-- I MEAN, YOU'RE A MEXICAN AMERICAN BUT YOU'RE NOT FROM MEXICO. YOU'RE FROM TEXAS.
RIGHT, I'M FROM TEXAS. U.S. HISPANIC.
Stephen:  YOU'RE U.S. HISPANIC.
BUT WE COME IN PEACE AND WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED.. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  THE THING IS I DON'T DOUBT THAT PEOPLE WILL WATCH THIS, AND THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME IS BECAUSE, A, IT'S NOT IN-- IS IT IN ENGLISH?
IT IS IN ENGLISH, ACTUALLY.
Stephen:  THEN WHY ISN'T THE NAME ENGLISH? EL RAY IS NOT ENGLISH.
I CALLED IT EL RAY BECAUSE EL RAY MEANS THE CAPTAIN. EVERYBODY WHO WATCHES IT FEELS LIKE THE KING. EVERYTHING YOU WANT IS THERE. THE PROGRAM IS IN ENGLISH. I HAVE FIVE KIDS AND I REALIZED THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT REPRESENTED THEM IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS ALSO MAINSTREAM SO ANYONE CAN WATCH IT. YOU DON'T THINK OF "SPY KIDS" AS BEING HISPANIC FILMS.
Stephen:  I DO. BECAUSE I KNOW YOU DIRECTED THEM, THAT'S WHY.
MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT. THEY'D WATCH IT BECAUSE IT'S POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT. AND I THOUGHT THE NETWORK SHOULD BE THE SAME WAY BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE, DIVERSITY IS REALLY KEY AT THE NETWORK, AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. WHEN WE DID THE RESEARCH, WE FOUND THERE WERE ABOUT 110 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE NETWORKS IN THE U.S. ABOUT 10 WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN. BUT THE LARGEST MINORITY IS HISPANIC, AND THERE WASN'T ONE LIKE THIS BUT THERE WERE TWO DOG CHANNELS. I DECIDED TO GO AND MAKE ONE.
Stephen:  WHAT LANGUAGE ARE THE DOG CHANNELS IN? >>I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTAND. BUT THE ADVERTISING IS REALLY INTERESTING.
Stephen:  HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF STARTING A DOG CHANNEL IN CHIHUAHUA? WHAT UPSETS ME IS I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN 20 YEARS OR SOMETHING, HISPANIC WILL BE MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES?
WE'RE 1 IN 6 RIGHT NOW. AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE 1 IN 3 BY 2050. SO I FIGURED IT WAS ABOUT TIME TO HAVE A NETWORK DIVERSE ENOUGH TO INCLUDE A LOT OF VOICES. IT WAS VERY HARD TO BREAK INTO THE INDUSTRY, SEEING LOOKING AT YOUR AUDIENCE HOW DIVERSE THEY ARE, FOR THEM HAVE TO HAVE A VOICE.
Stephen:  HOW MANY ARE OF HISPANIC ORIGIN?   ( CHEERS ) THAT'S ALMOST THREE OF THEM. HOW DARE YOU, SIR. HOW MANY OF ARE YOU OF A DIVERSE BACKGROUND? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A BAKER'S DOZEN RIGHT THERE. SO LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMMING HERE. THE NEW-- YOUR FIRST ORIGINAL DRAMA IS "FROM DUSK TILL DAWN." THE SERIES, IT PREMIERED IN MARCH. THAT'S BASED ON YOUR OWN MOVIE.
YES.
Stephen:  OKAY, HOW HARD DID YOU NEGOTIATE WITH YOURSELF TO GET THE RIGHTS TO THAT?
IT WAS LIKE, "ROBERT, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Stephen:  LET'S TAKE A CLIP OF THE FIRST EPISODE.
Stephen:  LET'S TAKE A CLIP OF THE FIRST EPISODE.
SHE'S REAL. SHE'S REAL.
Stephen:  HOW MUCH OF THE SERIES IS JUST THAT WOMAN? IT'S THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN? YOU MIGHT HAVE A HIT ON YOUR HANDS.
YOU CAN JUST WATCH THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
Stephen:  IS THIS GOING TO BE THE BEGINNING OF AN EMPIRE FOR YOU? ARE YOU GOING TO BE THE HISPANIC OPRAH? ( LAUGHTER )
THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL GOAL. BUT I THINK NOW IT'S KIND OF REALLY WANTED TO CREATE A PLACE FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO COME AND BE A PART OF THIS NETWORK. I REALLY WANTED TO PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR PEOPLE-- I CALL IT THE PEOPLE'S NETWORK, SO PEOPLE HAVE A VOICE.
Stephen:  IT'S ALL PEOPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE HISPANIC, RIGHT?
NOT AT ALL.
Stephen:  SPEAKING OF EXPLODING HISPANIC DEMOGRAPHICS, YOU'RE ONE OF 10 CHILDREN.
I AM.
Stephen:  I'M ONE OF 11 CHILDREN.
WOW.
IT'S NOT A CONTEST BUT I'M WINNING. WOULD YOU LIKE TO RACE ME IN HOW FAST YOU CAN SAY YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND I CAN SAY MINE? ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT? ONE, TWO, THREE, AND THEN WE'LL GO. ONE, TWO, THREE, AND THEN WE GO. WE DON'T GO ON THREE. OKAY. AND THEN YOU GO FROM OLDEST TO YOUNGEST?
I MIGHT BEAT YOU.
Stephen:  YOU WON'T. READY, ONE, TWO, THREE. JIMMY, EDDIE,... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, THANK YOU SO MUCH. EL RAY NETWORK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
