Stephen:  WHEW! WHEW! WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO BE HERE. YOU KNOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU KNOW THE SHOW, YOU KNOW I LOVE BEING A CHRISTIAN. I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY PERKS -- ETERNAL SALVATION WITH OUR LORD IN HEAVEN, AND A MAGICAL RABBIT WHO PASSES OUT CANDY. HINDUS YOU'RE MISSING OUT. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT ELEPHANT GETS YOU. AND THIS WEEK, WE CHRISTIANS GOT SOME VERY SPECIAL NEWS.
THE SEARCH FOR THE HOLY GRAIL COULD BE OVER.
TWO SPANISH HISTORIANS SAY THEY HAVE FOUND THE HOLY GRAIL, A CUP SAID TO HAVE BEEN USED BY JESUS DURING THE LAST SUPPER. THEY SAY IT WAS HIDDEN SINCE THE 11th CENTURY INSIDE ANOTHER ANCIENT CUP HOUSED IN A BASILICA IN SPAIN.
Stephen:  THEY FOUND THE HOLY GRAIL. AND THEY KNOW IT DATES BACK TO JESUS BECAUSE THE BOTTOM READS, "NOT DISHWASHER SAFE BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN INVENTED YET." ( LAUGHTER ) , OF COURSE, EVERY TIME SOMEONE FINDS THE HOLY GRAIL SKEPTICS COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE 200 SUPPOSED GRAILS IN EUROPE ALONE. THAT'S NOT EVEN COUNTING THE ONE LIL' JON FOUND. WELL, FOLKS, AS A MAN OF FAITH, I BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE ARE CHARLETANS BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE REAL HOLY GRAIL. BEHOLD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DISCOVERED IT THIS MORNING AT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD DELI. MERE MILES FROM THE SACRED GROUND OF ST. PATRICK'S' CATHEDRAL. IT WAS ENTRUSTED TO ME BY A MYSTERIOUS MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH ROBERT LANGDON'S SYMBOLOGICAL ANALYSES, ALL THE SIGNS ARE RIGHT HERE. OKAY. LOOK HERE, JIMMY. THE THREE BEANS SIGNIFY THE HOLY TRINITY-- THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY ROAST. AND THE WORD "CAPPUCCINO," CLEARLY THE SIGNATURE OF THE CAPUCHIN MONKS WHO HID THE GRAIL FROM THE INVADING SARACEN ARMIES IN THE 14th CENTURY. AND THE CLINCHER-- THAT IT BELONGED TO CHRIST IS THAT I FOUND SOME BEARD HAIR ON THE RIM. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I HAVE NO BEARD. OF COURSE, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE. WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO HE WHO DRINKS FROM A FALSE GRAIL.  ♪  ♪ ( SCREAMING ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  HE CHOSE NOT GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE GOES, HERE GOES. AARRGGHH! AAARRGGHH! THAT COFFEE IS HOT! PUT I'M FINE, SO THAT'S THE GRAIL. AND I GUESS I'M GOING TO LIVE FOREVER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, NATION, EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE FIVE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT. THEY'RE LIKE A JUDICIAL VERSION OF ONE DIRECTION IN THAT ALL THEIR RULINGS GO IN ONE DIRECTION. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT TWO YEARS AGO, I WAS BETRAYED BY THE CUTE ONE, CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS BECAUSE IN AN ACT OF JUDAS-PRUDENCE, HE VOTED TO UPHOLD OBAMACARE, AND THAT BROKE MY HEART. AND EVEN WORSE, UNDER OBAMACARE, I AM COVERED FOR CARDIAC BREAKAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS. MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK.
BREAKING NEWS ON THE SUPREME COURT, CHANGING THE RULES AGAIN WHEN IT COMES TO CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS.
YOU CAN NOW GIVE TO AS MANY CANDIDATES AS YOU WANT. THERE IS NO LIMIT ON HOW MUCH TOTAL MONEY ANY INDIVIDUAL PERSON CAN SPEND. THE COURT'S MAJORITY OPINION, WRITTEN BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS SAID MONEY IS SPEECH AND THAT YOU CAN'T LIMIT HOW MUCH AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON CAN SPEND. HE SAID IF THE FIRST AMENDMENT CAN ABIDE BY FLAG BURNING, NAZI PARADES, AND PROTESTS AT MILITARY FUNERALS IT CAN ABIDE BY PEOPLE SPENDING AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY WANT TO SUPPORT THE CANDIDATES OF THEIR CHOICES.
Stephen:  WELL SAID-- UNLIMITED CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS ARE JUST AS GOOD AS NAZIS. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THE CASE IN QUESTION IS "McCUTCHEON V. F.E.C.," AND IN A 5-4 DECISION, THE COURTS ELIMINATED THE $123,200 CAP ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU CAN DONATE, WHICH IS GREAT FOR ALL OF US, IF BY "US" YOU MEAN THE 591 PEOPLE WHO GAVE THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE DONATION IN 2012. AND IF YOU'RE NOT ONE OF US, YOU REALLY SHOULD BE. ( LAUGHTER ) WE HAVE GREAT PARTIES, TWO OF THEM. FOLKS, THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AGGREGATE CAPS UNFAIRLY LIMIT HOW LOUD MY CASH COULD TALK INSPECTOR THE ANTIQUATED ASSUMPTION GIVING POLITICIANS GREASY PAPER BAGS FULL OF MONEY IS SOMEHOW A CORRUPTING INFLUENCE. BUT JUSTICE ROBERTS TEACHES US GOVERNMENT REGULATION MAY NOT TARGET THE GENERAL GRATITUDE A CANDIDATE MAY FEEL TOWARDS THOSE WHO SUPPORT HIM OR THE POLITICAL ACCESS SUCH SUPPORT MAY AFFORD. INGRATIATION AND ACCESS ARE NOT CORRUPTION. IN FACT, THOSE THINGS DON'T EVEN HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF CORRUPTION. DID YOU GET THAT? INGRATIATION AND ACCESS ARE NOT CORRUPTION. SO IF YOU THINK LEGISLATORS LINING UP TO LISTEN TO MEGADONORS LIKE THE KOCH BROTHERS OR GEORGE SOROS APPEARS CORRUPT, GOOD NEWS-- JOHN ROBERTS HAS RULED YOU DON'T THINK THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, ROBERTS KNOWS THERE'S ONLY ONE REAL TYPE OF CORRUPTION-- QUID PRO QUO. OR THE DIRECT EXCHANGE OF AN OFFICIAL ACT FOR MONEY, AND THAT IS EASY TO PROVE, AS LONG AS POLITICS REMEMBER TO HOLD ON TO THEIR ITEMIZED CORRUPTION RECEIPTS. ( LAUGHTER ) THE POINT IS EVERYONE IN AMERICA SHOULD CELEBRATE THIS RULING. HERE NOT TO CELEBRATE THIS RULING IS LEGAL AFFAIRS EDITOR FOR "SLATE," EMILY BAZELON. EMILY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK TO SEE YOU. ( APPLAUSE ) ISN'T THIS WONDERFUL NEWS FOR OPPRESSED MINORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES?
LIKE RICH PEOPLE.
Stephen:  YES. THE 1%. THERE'S NO MINORITY SMALLER, AND WE ARE THE ONES WHO HAD OUR VOICES STIFLED BY THESE CAMPAIGN DONATION LIMITATIONS.
NO, I DON'T THINK RICH PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE HAD THEIR VOICES STIFLED. WE HAVE PLENTY OF INFLUENCE OF RICH PEOPLE IN POLITICS.
Stephen:  NOT AS MUCH AS WE COULD. THAT IS WHAT JOHN ROBERTS IS SAYING, WHILE WE HAVE INFLUENCE NOT AS MUCH AS WE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE.
RIGHT, BUT FOR YOU, THE RICH PEOPLE, TO HAVE ALL THE INFLUENCE YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE,  YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE REST OF US WITH NO INFLUENCE BECAUSE --
Stephen:  YOU ARE FREE TO HAVE COLLECTIVE ACTION. GET TOGETHER OR GET RICH.
BUT WE-- WE --
Stephen:  HAVE YOU EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT?
NOT SERIOUSLY.
Stephen:  OKAY.
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO COMPETE SO IT WOULD BE SO EASY FOR CANDIDATES AND PARTIES TO GO TO THE FEW PEOPLE WHO CAN QUICKLY FUND CAMPAIGNS THAT THERE'S NO REASON TO RAISE MONEY OR REALLY CARE ABOUT THE VIEWS OF EVERYBODY ELSE.
Stephen:  BUT, I THINK IT'S BETTER FOR AMERICA BECAUSE LET'S SAY-- WHERE DO YOU LIVE, CONNECTICUT?
YEAH.
Stephen:  OKAY, YOU'RE IN CONNECTICUT, AND IN YOUR DISTRICT, YOU'RE SUPPORTING THE CANDIDATE YOU LIKE FOR CONGRESS.
OKAY.
Stephen:  AND LET'S SAY THIS PERSON GETS ELECTED AND YOU'RE REPRESENTED IN CONGRESS BY THAT ONE PERSON, ALL RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen:  SHELL ADELSON LIVING IN LAS VEGAS GIVES MONEY TO HIS CONGRESSMAN AND IS REPRESENTED BY THEM, AND THEN HE CAN GIVE TO EVERY OTHER CONGRESSMAN AS WELL, AND HE IS THEN REPRESENTED IN EVERY DISTRICT OF AMERICA. ISN'T THAT MORE DEMOCRACY?
NO, BECAUSE-- ( LAUGHTER ) MY CONGRESSWOMAN-- WOMAN-- SHOULD BE REPRESENTING THE VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HER DISTRICT, IN MY CITY. AND THE NOTION THAT YOU CAN HAVE A FEW WEALTHY PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHO GIVE TO EVERYONE AND WHO ARE GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY COURTED BY THE INSIDERS AND THE PARTY, THAT WILL GIVE THEM SO MUCH MORE POWER.
Stephen:  YOU THINK THAT'S CORRUPTION? DO YOU THINK THAT IS CORRUPTION?
I THINK THAT IS CORRUPTION, BECAUSE --
Stephen:  YOU'RE WRONG. JOHN ROBERTS SAID THAT DOESN'T APPEAR LIKE CORRUPTION.
JOHN ROBERT'S DEFINITION OF CORRUPTION IS SO NARROW IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REAL PROBLEMS IN OUR SYSTEM. WHAT IS REALLY A PROBLEM IS ALL OF THIS INFLUENCE. IT'S NOT BRIBERY, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY ALL WE'RE LEFT WITH AND IS VERY HARD TO PROVE. IT IS THE WAY IN WHICH MONEY SHAPES THE POSITIONS THAT CANDIDATES TAKE, EVEN THIS THOSE POSITIONS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT MOST AMERICANS BELIEVE SHOULD BE THE LAW.
Stephen:  MAYBE JOHN ROBERTS HAS MORE FAITH IN AMERICAN PEOPLE AND BILLIONAIRES LIKE THAN YOU DO.
HE HAS A LOT MORE FAITH IN BILLIONAIRES THAN I DO, BUT IN JUSTICE BREYER'S DISSENT YOU HAVE THE CONCERN OF ALL THE OTHER CITIZENS OF THE COUNTRY. WHEN THE FRAMERS WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE ELECTIONS SHOULD WORK. THERE ARE WRITINGS HOW THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS BROADLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE CITIZENRY.
Stephen:  THE CAP FOR PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTION IN EVERY TWO-YEAR CYCLE IS $5200. I LIKE WHAT JUSTICE THOMAS HAD TO SAY IN HIS ADDENDUM TO THE DECISION, I ASSUME. HE SAID THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY CAP. IS HE AHEAD OF HIS TIME-- BY WHICH I MEAN ABOUT MAYBE ONE YEAR?
PROBABLY BECAUSE NOW THAT THE DEFINITION OF CORRUPTION IS SO NARROW THAT IT'S ONLY BRIBERY, IT WILL BE RELATIVELY EASY FOR THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES, ALL FIVE OF THEM, TO SAY THAT THERE'S NO LEGITIMATE RATIONALE FOR CONGRESS TO IMPOSE EVEN THE $5200 PER CANDIDATE, PER CYCLE LIMIT. IT DOES FEEL LIKE THAT IS AROUND THE CORNER.
Stephen:  ROBERTS SAYS INGRATIATION IS NOT CORRUPTION. DO YOU THINK INGRATIATION IS CORRUPTION, OR IS IT JUST ENSHRINING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO GOOD MANNERS?
I DON'T THINK INGRATIATION IS THE SAME AS GOOD MANNERS.
Stephen:  REALLY? IF SOMEONE GIVES ME $1 MILLION FOR MY CAMPAIGN, A LITTLE NOTE WOULD BE NICE.
BUT A LITTLE NOTE --
Stephen:  AND FLOWERS AND MAYBE E.P.A. REGULATIONS BEING CUT?
I GUESS IT'S THE STEP FROM THE FLOWERS TO THE E.P.A. REGULATION BEING CUT THAT I WORRY ABOUT. I'M ALL FOR THE FLOWERS?
EMILY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
