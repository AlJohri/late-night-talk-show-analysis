WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE HEARTBREAKING FILM "12 YEARS A SLAVE." ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, SLAVERY DIDN'T LAST AS LONG AS I THOUGHT. PLEASE WELCOME STEVE McQUEEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, MR. McQUEEN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. THIS IS A HUGE THRILL. OFF GIANT MOVIE THIS YEAR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: NOW YOU'RE A BRITISH ARTIST AND FILMMAKER, YOUR FILMS INCLUDE "HUNGER" AND "SHAME." CURRENTLY YOU'RE THE PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR OF "12 YEARS A SLAVE" WHICH IS ADAPTED FROM AN 1853 CHRONICLE OF A MAN NAMED SOLOMON NORTHUP, RIGHT?
CORRECT.
Stephen: TELL THE PEOPLE THE STORY OF SOLOMON.
WELL, SOLOMON NORTHUP WAS A FREE BLACK MAN THAT LIVED IN SARATOGA, NEW YORK, WHO GOT KIDNAPPED IN 1841 AND HE WAS BROUGHT TO THE SOUTH WHERE HE LIVED FOR 12 YEARS WITHIN SLAVERY.
Stephen: OKAY, THE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS I -- YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. THE THING THAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT IT MAKES SLAVERY LOOK REALLY BAD. (LAUGHTER) IS THAT A SPOILER ALERT? I DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER)
IT WAS PRETTY CRUEL. IT WAS PRETTY BRUTAL. IT WAS SLAVERY, SO UNFORTUNATELY --
Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT. THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT SLAVERY.
PRECISELY.
Stephen: I'M ON RECORD AS SAYING THAT I'M AGAINST SLAVERY, I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT.
I'M VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: IT TOOK A FAIR AMOUNT OF COURAGE, BUT I DID IT. I'M FROM THE DREAM SOUTH, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA. AS WE LIKE TO SAY, ALL ROADS LEAD NORTH FROM CHARLESTON. (LAUGHTER) WHERE DOES THIS MOVIE TAKE PLACE?
IT TAKES PLACE IN LOUISIANA.
Stephen: OKAY, WELL THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. THOSE PEOPLE ARE TERRIBLE. (LAUGHTER) SOUTH CAROLINA, WAS SLAVERY BAD EVERYWHERE? BECAUSE I GREW UP HEARING THAT SOME SLAVES ENJOYED AT LEAST THE JOB SECURITY. I'M NOT SAYING SLAVERY. (AUDIENCE REACTS) HONEST TO GOD. I GREW UP BEING TAUGHT THE CIVIL WAR WAS NOT ABOUT SLAVERY, IT WAS ABOUT ECONOMIC ISSUES AND ABOUT STATES RIGHTS AND THAT A LOT OF SLAVES, YOU KNOW, ENJOYED THE JOB SECURITY.
I WOULD DOUBT THAT VERY MUCH. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERYDAY.
YEAH. I WILL SAY NO TO THAT COMPLETELY AND EMPHATICALLY, IN FACT. QUITE EMPHATICALLY.
Stephen: OKAY. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. I A LOT OF TIMES -- I DON'T CARE BUT I HEAR YOU'RE A BLACK GUY.
APPARENTLY.
Stephen: OKAY. IF YOU'RE A BLACK GUY BUT YOU HAVE AN ENGLISH ACCENT.
CORRECT, YES.
Stephen: WHAT IS AN ENGLISH PERSON DOING COMING OVER HERE AND TELLING US OUR SORDID HISTORY. WE'LL ACCUSE OURSELVES OF CRIMES, IF YOU DON'T MIND, SIR. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, SLAVERY WASN'T PARTICULARLY FOCUSED JUST N THE UNITED STATES. IT WAS A GLOBAL AND WORLD TRADE.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PEOPLE DID TO THE IRISH, MY PEOPLE.
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO -- AS AN ENGLISH PERSON? WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO MY PEOPLE, THE IRISH PEOPLE, FOR WHAT YOU DID TO US?
(LAUGHS).
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGIZE RIGHT NOW?
I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR ALL CRIMES OF CRUELTY AND SLAVERY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WHICH EXIST EVEN TODAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. PRETEND I'M A MOVIEGOER, OKAY? SATURDAY NIGHT, I CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN GOING TO SEE "THOR". (LAUGHTER) -- LAST VEGAS, MAYBE THAT BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR THING. (LAUGHTER) AND "12 YEARS A SLAVE." SELL ME.
WELL, I'LL SELL IT TO YOU THIS WAY --
Stephen: ONE OF THEM IS "THOR." (LAUGHTER)
YES, HE HAS A VERY BIG HAMMER. "12 YEARS A SLAVE" IS A TRUE STORY ABOUT AN AMERICAN HERO AND I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY TO YOU, THE AUDIENCE, THAT HE'S A RARITY IN THE WORLD AS A FIGURE AND AS I SAID BEFORE, HE NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED AND NEEDS TO BE SORT OF LOOKED AT IN PERSPECTIVE NOW.
Stephen: WAS THIS NOVEL POPULAR BACK IN THE DAY?
IT SOLD 27,000 COPIES IN ITS FIRST YEAR. BUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER WAS UNCLE TOM'S CABIN CAME THE NEXT YEAR AND OBLITERATED IT SO IT GOT BURIED.
Stephen: AND SHE WAS JUST RIDING HIS COATTAILS.
AND SHE TOOK A LOT OF FROM THAT BOOK AND NEXT YEAR WE HAD A FICTIONALIZED BOOK OF SLAVERY THAT BECAME A HUGE BEST-SELLER AND BURIED "12 YEARS A SLAVE."
Stephen: DID YOU PAY ANYTHING TO SOLOMON NORTHUP FOR HIS STORY?
NO, BUT THE PUBLIC ARE PAYING HIM VERY, VERY WELL. THE BOOK HAS SOLD OVER 100,000 COPIES IN TWO MONTHS.
Stephen: 100,000 COPIES IN TWO MONTHS! BUT HE DOESN'T GET PART OF YOUR KNEW SPREE IN.
NO, HE DOESN'T GET A CUT OF MY MOVIE.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO POINT OUT THAT YOU ARE MAKING MONEY OFF THE LABOR OF A BLACK MAN. (LAUGHTER) AND PAYING HIM NOTHING! THERE'S A WORD FOR THAT, YOU REALIZE.
TRUST ME, I'M NOT GETTING PAID THAT MUCH, UNFORTUNATELY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) STEVE McQUEEN, "12 YEARS A SLAVE." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
