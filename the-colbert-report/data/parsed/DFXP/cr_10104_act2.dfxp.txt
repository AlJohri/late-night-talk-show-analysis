Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, I AM FEELING FINE TONIGHT AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THE DEFEAT OF A BALLOT INITIATIVE LAST WEEK. COLUMBUS, OHIO'S ISSUE 6  WHICH WOULD HAVE RAISED PROPERTY TAXES TO SUPPORT THE COLUMBUS ZOO FAMOUS FOR JACK HANNAH, AMERICA'S FOREMOST EXPERT IN CONVINCING TV HOSTS TO LET ANIMALS PEE-PEE ON THEM. LAST WEEK, OHIO VOTERS POO-POOED IT.
MORE THAN 70% OF FRANKLIN COUNTY VOTERS SAID NO TO THAT ZOO LEVEE.
Stephen:  IN YOUR FACE, MANATEE! OH, WHICHEVER END OF YOU THIS IS. WE OWE THIS VICTORY TO THE KOCH BROTHERS WHO HELPED SWAY FRANKLIN COUNTY VOTERS WITH THIS FLIER CALLING THE ZOO TAX A MONEY GRAB. LOOK AT THAT GREEDY CHIMP ASKING FOR A HANDOUT OR A FOOT-OUT. YOU CAN'T TELL WITH THESE GUYS. ALL YOU KNOW FOR SURE IS THE OTHER THREE LIMBS ARE MASTURBATING. AS THE KOCH'S MAILER WARNED, THIS WAS GOING TO BE A MASSIVE 105% INCREASE ON PROPERTY TAXES. 105%! THAT IS A SCARY NUMBER. WAY SCARIER THAN THE ACTUAL INCREASE 0.76%, OR ABOUT $23 FOR THE MEDIAN HOMEOWNER. AND ALL YOU GET FOR YOUR 23 BUCKS IS ONE OF THE BEST ZOOS IN AMERICA. FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY, YOU COULD BUY YOUR OWN COPY OF "MADAGASCAR" ON D.V.D. NATION, THE KOCHS' VICTORY AGAINST THE COLUMBUS ZOO TAX SHOWS THEY'RE WILLING TO PLAY HARDBALL EVEN WHEN THEY PLAY SMALL BALL. AS THE OHIO DIRECTOR OF AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY SAID, THERE IS NOTHING WE WON'T DO, NOTHING! THERE IS NO CHILDREN'S FIELD TRIP TOO SMALL FOR THESE TWO MEN TO RUIN. ( LAUGHTER ) THEIR NEXT CAMPAIGN IS BANNING SHARP STRAWS TO PROTECT OUR PRECIOUS JUICE BOX RESERVES. BUT WE'RE NOT DONE FIGHTING THIS, FOLKS BECAUSE THE COLUMBUS ZOO PROMISES TO TRY THIS AGAIN AS SOON AS NOVEMBER. WE AT THE THE "COLBERT REPORT" ARE NOT WAITING UNTIL NOVEMBER. WE ARE CREATING OUR OWN ISSUES AD THAT WE ARE WILLING TO SELL THE KOCH BROTHERS FOR A BILLION DOLLARS. JIM.
THE COLUMBUS ZOO WANTS MORE OF YOUR MONEY, BUT WHERE DOES THAT MONEY GO? TO FREE HOUSING FOR FOREIGNERS WHO SPEND ALL DAY HIGH ON EUCALYPTUS. TO SEX FIENDS GETTING FREAKY IN FRONT OF YOUR CHILDREN. AND GOVERNMENT-SUBSIDIZED O-LLAMA CARE. THEY DON'T SHARE OUR GENES. AND THEY DON'T SHARE OUR VALUES. IT'S TIME TO LOCK THEM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY. THIS AD SHOULD BE PAID FOR BY AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  FOLKS, NO MATTER HOW GREAT-- YES, I AGREE. I AGREE. NO MATTER HOW GREAT THOSE APES ARE, LET'S PROVE THAT HUMANS ARE STILL BEST WHEN IT COMES TO FLINGING OUR EXCREMENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
