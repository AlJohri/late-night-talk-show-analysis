Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY GUEST TONIGHT SAYS THE  UNIVERSE'S 14-BILLION YEAR  HISTORY CAN BE SEEN IN HUMAN  BODIES. ESPECIALLY BEFORE I PUT MY  MAKEUP ON. PLEASE WELCOME NEAL SHUBIN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING BANCH GOOD TO  SEE YOU.
LET'S GIVE THE PEOPLE YOUR  QUITE IMPRESSIVE TV -- YOU ARE  THE ASSOCIATED DEAN OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE IT'S  UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU ARE KNOWN FOR YOUR 2004  DISCOVERY OF SO-CALLED MISSING  LINK BETWEEN FISH AND LAND ANIMALS, THE FOSSIL. WHICH WE'VE HAD ON THE SHOW. HE'S A GREAT GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE  UNIVERSE WITHIN:  DISCOVERING  THE COMMON HISTORY OF ROCKS, PLAN THES AND PEOPLE."  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
[ LAUGHTER ] WHAT COMMON. I'M NOT RELATED TO A PLANT,  OKAY? I'M IN THE RELATED TO --
YOU ABSOLUTELY ARE.
Stephen: I AM NOT, OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE QUESTIONABLE UNCLES  BUT -- NOT A FICUS. WHY AM I RELATED TO A PLANT?
THE EVOLUTION OF LIFE IS  BAITSD ON THE SHARED  SIMILARITIES CREATURES HAVE. WE SEE THAT IN THE DNA OF EVERY  CREATURE ON THE PLANET FROM  MICROROBES TO WORMS TO TREES TO PLANTS TO SHE RUBS TO POISON IVY  TO PEOPLE. THERE'S A SHARED HISTORY.
Stephen: IS THAT BECAUSE WE  ALL INTERBRED ON THE ARCH?
IT'S BEEN ABOUT 3.5 BILLION  YEARS OF PROCEED WITHING.
Stephen: ABOUT 6,000 YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T MEAN TO BLOW HOLE UNTIL  YOUR THEORY THERE. THE EVIDENCE MIGHT SAY  OTHERWISE.
Stephen: THE MIGHT OR IT  MIGHT NOT. HOW AM I RELATED TO A ROCK. A ROCK WAS NEVER ALIVE.
IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL STORY. WE HAVE A SHARED HISTORY WITH  ROCKS. IF YOU LOOK AT ROCKS AND PEOPLE,  THE ATOMS IN THE BODIES AROSE IN  THE BING BANG AND THE STELLAR PROCESSES THE SUPERNOAF. THE WATER AROSE FROM THE SOLAR  SYSTEM THE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES  WHICH SHAPED THE ORGANS WERE RELATED TO THE PLANETS. IT'S LAYER AFTER LAYER OF  HISTORY. THE EVIDENCE IS THE LAYERS OF  ROCKS, THE CHEMISTRY OF THE  BODIES FROM THE DNA INSIDE IT TO THE AND TOM CALL STRUCTURES TO  THE FOSSILS WE FIND IN THE ROCKS  AROUND THE WORLD. IT'S MULTIPLE LINES OF EVIDENCE  POINTING TO OVER 3.5 BILLION  YEARS OF HISTORY IN THE BODY.
Stephen: WHY MUST YOU MAKE  ME FEEL SMALL? [ LAUGHTER ] WHY ARE YOU SCIENTISTS HELL BENT  ON CRUSHING THE INDIVIDUALALITY  OF A MAN, OF THE FEELING THAT THERE'S A DEVINE SPARK OF  UNIQUENESS INSIDE OF ME? IT'S NOT A BETTER FEELING.
Stephen: NO, NO, NO IT'S  NOT ABOUT OUR FEELING IT'S ABOUT  MY FEELING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OKAY? WHAT IS THE VALUE? WHAT IS THE VALUE OF KNOWING  THAT I AM RELATED TO -- YOU SAY  I'M RELATED TO JUPITER, YOU SAY.
YOU MOST DEFINITELY ARE.
Stephen: YOU ARE, TOO.
JUPITER IS OUR PLANET TEARY  COUSIN. IT'S THE LARGEST IN THE SOLAR  SYSTEM. IT ORBIT CHANGES EVER SO OFTEN. EVERY 10,000, 20,000, 40,000,  100,000 YEARS. THESE ARE CYCLES AND ON CYCLES. THEY LEAD TO CHANGES IN THE  GLACIERS STNCHES NOT GLOBAL  WARMING.
IT'S JUPITER IMPACT ITS THE. THE HUMAN HISTORY AND EVOLUTION  IS BASED ON THAT IT'S A PRE  FOUND DEEP CONNECTION WE SHARE, US AS HUMANS NOT ONLY TO PLANTS  NOT ONLY TO MIEB ROBES TO ROCKS,  THE -- MICROBES, EVERYTHING, THE WHOLE UNIVERSE.
Stephen: EVERYTHING WAS  GENERATED IN THE TURNAS OF  PRIMORDIAL STARS.
YES, EXACTLY.
Stephen: DID YOU JUST MOCK  THE WAY I SAID. THAT YOU WERE LIKE YEAH,  WHATEVER. DID YOU SAY WHATEVER TO ME WHEN  I'M TRYING TO SWALLOW THE BITTER  PILL OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE? [ LAUGHTER ] ARE WE STILL EVOLVING?
MOST DEFINITELY.
Stephen: THEN HOW COME I  DON'T HAVE CLAWS? I WANT SOME.
YOU NEED VARIATION NOORS  TRAIT STOONCHTS THE FACT THAT  I'M REIT WILLED TO ROCKS AND PEOPLE DOES THAT MEAN I'M NOT  RELATED TO MONKEYS?
NO, NO IF YOU ARE WORRIED  ABOUT BEING RELATED TO MONKEYS  IT'S THE ROCKS, PLANETS AND WORMS THAT ARE THE REAL PROBLEMS  THERE.
Stephen: YOU ALREADY SAID  I'M REIT WILLED TO A FISH,  RIGHT?
YEAH, THE CHALLENGE I'M  TAKING IT TO ROCKS AND PLANETS  AND STELLAR PROCESSES AND THE BANG BANG AND SO FORTH. IT'S THE UNITY OF ALL PHYSICAL  ENTITIES IN THE UNIVERSE.
Stephen: CAN YOU GET ME $5  WORTH OF WHATEVER IT IS -- [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU DON'T EAT A LOT OF WHEAT, DO  YOU? [ LAUGHTER ] DOCTOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME  NEIL SHUBIN, "THE UNIVERSE  WITHIN."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND A
