WELCOME TOO THE REPORT,  EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. FOLKS, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. HEY, HEY, LET ME ASK YOU  SOMETHING, EVERYBODY SEE THAT  DEBATE LAST NIGHT?  BUTN'T THAT  GREAT?  I MEAN, ROMNEY CLEARLY  WON. AND, FOLKS, I AM NOT JUST SAYING  THAT, I AM SAYING THAT ON TV. SO IF YOU'RE AN UNDECIDED VOTER  WHO DID NOT WATCH, JUST TRUST  ME, IT IS 2 AND 0. EVEN THOUGH, EVEN THOUGH, FOLKS,  THE NIGHT WAS CLEARLY STACKED  AGAINST MITT. AFTER THAT FIRST DEBATE DEBACLE,  BARACK OBAMA HAD DEFINITELY WON  THE LOW EXPECTATIONS GAME.
FOR OBAMA THE BAR IS RATHER  LOW, COMPARED TO THE FIRST  DEBATE ALL HE HAS TO DO IS  STRING A FEW SENTENCES TOGETHER, COHERENTLY TO MAKE EYE CONTACT  WITH A SINGLE EXTENTIENT HUMAN  AND SHOW THE SLIGHTEST ANIMATION  IN HIS FACE.
Colbert: CHARLES KRAUT  HAMMER IS RIGHT, LOW BAR,  OBAMA'S LAST DEBATE PERFORMANCE  WAS SO BAD .. THAT BAR WAS SET AT CHARLES KRAUT HAMMER.
NOW, MITT, ON THE OTHER HAND,  MITT, MITT ROMNEY, MUCH GREATER  CHALLENGE.
WE ARE TOLD THAT THEY HAVE  PRACTICED TO SUCH A LEVEL OF  DETAIL THAT HE EVEN WAS  PREPARING HOW HE SITS AND THERE IS A GOOD REASON FOR THAT. HE IS GOING TO BE SITTING ON A  BAR STOOL AND MITT ROMNEY IS A  MORMON, SO HE DOESN'T SPEND A  LOT OF TIME ON BAR STOOLS, ACCORDING TO HIS AIDES, BECAUSE  HE DOESN'T DRINK.
Colbert: YES. THAT IS TRUE. THAT IS TRUE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. ONLY PEOPLE WHO DRINK KNOW HOW  TO SIT ON STOOLS. THAT'S WHY, WHENEVER YOU SEE  SOMEONE SUCCESSFULLY SITTING ON  ONE, THAT IS AN EARLY SIGN OF  ALCOHOLISM. SEEK HELP!, PLEASE!
THE GUY FALLING OFF THE  STOOL, THAT IS YOUR DESIGNATED  DRIVER. AND THAT IS WHY LAST NIGHT'S  DEBATE, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I  MEAN, IT WAS SUCH A CHALLENGE  FOR MITT. LACK OF STOOL EXPERIENCE. I MEAN, WHERE WOULD MITT HAVE  SEEN ONE?  HIS KITCHEN COUNTER?   EVERYONE KNOWS THE ROMNEY FAMILY  EATS STANDING AT PODIUMS. BUT ONCE MITT MANAGED TO DOCK  HIS BUTT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL  STOOL STATION, JUST LIKE THAT,  OH, THEN, THEN THE CANDIDATES TOOK THEIR GLOVES OFF AND  EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.
FIGHT NIGHT AT HOFSTRA, A  HEATED SHOWDOWN.
FIGHTING, FIEPS CITY AND  FIERCE.
LED TO HEAD IN A FIERCE  FIGHT.
THE DEBATE TURNED INTO A  FIGHT ON LONG ISLAND, I LOVED  IT.
I LOVED IT TOO, YOU CRAVE THE  BLOOD SPORTS JUST LOOK AT THEM  DEBATE THE PRESIDENT'S  COMMITMENT TO OIL   EXPLORATION ON FEDERAL LANDS.
HOW MUCH DID YOU CUT DRILLING  ON FEDERAL LANDS?
I HAD A QUESTION AND THE  QUESTION WAS HOW MUCH DID YOU  CUT THEM BY?  HOW MUCH DID YOU  CUT THEM BY?
OW!
I CANNOT BELIEVE CANDY  CROWLEY LET OBAMA WIELD THE FAN  BLADED LURPA BUT I HAVE TO SAY  SHE LOOKED GREAT WITH THE NEW HAIR EXTENSIONS. NOW, THEY TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF  THINGS BUT EVERYBODY KNEW THAT  MITT HAD ONE ACE IN THE HOLE,  LIBYA GATE.
ROMNEY AND HIS RUNNING MATE  HAVE BEEN HAMMERING THE  PRESIDENT OVER THIS COVERUP FOR  WEEKS. AMERICANS ARE ASKING, WHAT DID  THE PRESIDENT KNOW?  WHEN DID  THE PRESIDENT KNOW IT?  WHICH  ONE IS LIBYA?  AND LAST NIGHT, LAST NIGHT,  LAST NIGHT, MITT HAD OBAMA IN  HIS SIGHTS.
IT WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK. AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR THAT  TO BE TOLD TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE, WHETHER THAT WAS SOME  MISLEADING OR INSTEAD WHETHER WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED  YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY  DIDN'T WE KNOW.
THE SUGGESTION THAT ANYBODY  ON MY TEAM, FROM THE SECRETARY  OF STATE, U.N. AMBASSADOR,  ANYBODY ON MY TEAM WOULD PLAY POLITICS OR MISLEAD WHEN WE LOST  FOUR OF OUR OWN, GOVERNOR, IS  OFFENSIVE. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE DO. THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO AS  PRESIDENT, THAT IS NOT WHAT I DO  AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
Colbert: OKAY, OKAY, OBAMA  LANDED A GOOD PUNCH, BUT THEN  ROMNEY ASKED THE PRESIDENT THE  QUESTION THAT WOULD CHANGE  EVERYTHING.
I THINK IT IS INTERESTING THE  PRESIDENT JUST SAID SOMETHING  WHICH, WHICH IS THAT ON THE DAY AFTER THE ATTACK HE WENT INTO  THE ROSE GARDEN AND SAID THIS  WAS AN ACT OF TERROR.
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
YOU SAID IN THE ROSE GARDEN  THE DAY AFTER THE ATTACK IT WAS  AN ACT OF TERROR. IT WAS NOT A SPONTANEOUS  DEMONSTRATION?  IS THAT WHAT YOU  ARE SAYING.
PLEASE PROCEED, GOVERNOR.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET  THAT FOR THE RECORD BECAUSE IT  TOOK THE PRESIDENT 14 DAYS  BEFORE HE CALLED THE ATTACK IN BENGHAZI AN ACT OF TERROR.
GET THE TRANSCRIPT.
HE DID, IN FACT, SIR. SO LET  ME CALL IT AN ACT OF TERROR --
CAN YOU SAY THAT A LITTLE  LOUDER, CANDY?
HE DID CALL IT AN ACT OF  TERROR.
Colbert: NO, NO, NO, NO, IT  IS   SUPPOSED TO CHANGE  EVERYTHING THE OTHER WAY. ARE YOU OKAY?  LOOK, OBAMA  DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY ACT OF  TERROR, DID HE, JIM?
NO ACTS OF TERROR WILL EVER  SHAKE THE RESOLVE OF THIS GREAT  NATION.
OKAY BUT ACTS OF TERROR COULD  REFER TO ANYTHING. I MEAN, HOW DO WE KNOW HE IS  TALKING ABOUT BENGHAZI IN THAT  BENGHAZI SPEECH THE DAY AFTER  THE BENGHAZI ATTACKS?  HE COULD HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BELOVED  CHARACTER ACTOR BEN GAZZARA  BECAUSE FOLKSILY TELL YOU THERE  IS A SCANDAL THAT HE DOES NOT GET MORE ROLES. WHAT?  GAZZARA IS DEAD?   HAPPENED ON OBAMA'S WATCH.
FOLKS, THAT'S TRUE. THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MITT'S  MOMENT OF CHEST THUMPING  DOMINANCE OVER THE CARCASS OF  HIS OPPONENT, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR  THAT MEDDLING MODERATOR.
DID GOVERNOR ROMNEY HAVE TWO  OPPONENTS ON THAT STAGE.
IT WAS DISGRACEFUL WHAT CANDY  CROWLEY DID.
SHE INSERTED HER SELF AGAIN  AND AGAIN INTO THIS DEBATE.
Colbert: CANDY STUCK HER  NOSE INTO IT IN THE WRONG PLACE.
THE PROBLEM WAS THE TIME FOR  FACT CHECKING IS AFTER THE  EVENT, NOT DURING IT. SHE MADE A GIGANTIC MISTAKE.
Colbert: YES!, YES!  OH!  I  AGREE. WE ARE ALL ANGRY, YES!  THE TIME  FOR FACT CHECKING IS AFTER THE  EVENT, WHEN VOTERS HAVE STOPPED  WATCHING. WE SHOULD NOT BE SULLYING THEIR  EMOTIONAL REACTIONS WITH  ACCURACY. AND FOLKS, IT WASN'T JUST THE  MODERATOR WHO WAS TURNING THE  AUDIENCE AGAINST MITT. SO WAS THE AUDIENCE, WITH THEIR  STUPID QUESTIONS. RIGHT?
AND THE QUESTIONS. 11 QUESTIONS ASKED IN ALL, AND  SOME OF WHICH WILL CERTAINLY BE  DISCUSSED TOMORROW. TOPICS THAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD  MUCH ABOUT AT ALL IN THIS  PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
Colbert: YEAH. STUPID VOTERS. WHEN YOU ASK QUESTIONS THE  CANDIDATE HAVEN'T HEARD BEFORE,  HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO GIVE  THE ANSWERS WE HAVE HEARD FOR MONTHS?  AND JUST LISTEN TO  THESE CRAZY SUBJECTS!
EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN, IN FACT,  THERE WERE A LOT OF WOMEN'S  ISSUES DISCUSSED. SOME MIGHT ARGUE IT WAS OBVIOUS  PANDERING TO WOMEN.
Colbert: YEAH, OBVIOUSLY,  OBVIOUS, PANDERING. I AGREE WITH MELVIN KELLEY ON  THIS ONE. WHY, WHY ARE WE TALKING, WHY ARE  WE TALKING ABOUT LADY ISSUES IN  THE TOWN HALL?  OKAY?  SAVE IT  FOR THE SADIE HAWKINS DEBATE WHEN THE GIRLS ARE SUPPOSED TO  DO THE ASKING. AND THAT WASN'T THE ONLY OUT OF  LEFT FIELD TOPIC NO ONE CARES  ABOUT.
SEPARATE AND APART FROM EQUAL  PAY FOR WOMEN WE HEARD A  DISCUSSION ABOUT ASSAULT WEAPONS  BANS.
WHY ARE THEY BRINGING UP  ASSAULT WEAPONS?  NOT NOW IS NOT  THE TIME TO DISCUSS GUN CONTROL. WE HAVEN'T HAD A MASS SHOOTING  IN ALMOST 49 DAYS. BUT MITT'S ANSWER, MITT'S  ANSWER, FOLKS, GOT TO THE ROOT  OF OUR SUPPOSED GUN PROBLEM.
WHAT I BELIEVE IS WE HAVE TO  DO AS THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED  TOWARDS THE END OF HIS REMARKS  THERE, WHICH IS TO MAKE ENORMOUS EFFORTS TO ENFORCE THE GUN LAWS  THAT WE HAVE AND TO CHANGE THE  CULTURE OF VIOLENCE WE HAVE. BUT LET ME MENTION ANOTHER  THING. AND THAT IS PARENTS. WE NEED MOMS AND DADS HELPING  RAISE KIDS. WHEREVER POSSIBLE THE BENEFIT OF  HAVING TWO PARENTS IN THE HOME,  AND THAT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE. A LOT OF GREAT SINGLE MOMS,  SINGLE DADS, BUT GOSH TO TELL  OUR KIDS THAT BEFORE THEY HAVE  BABIES THEY OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT GETTING MARRIED TO SOMEONE, THAT  IS GREAT IDEA.
Colbert: ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY, FOLKS.  THE ANSWER  TO GUN VIOLENCE IS NOT GETTING  RID OF ASSAULT WEAPONS IT IS A  TWO PARENT HOME. BECAUSE WHEN A PSYCHOPATH MARCHS  INTO THE MALL IN KEVLAR BODY  ARMOR, SLOWLY LIFTING THE LASER  SIGHT OF HIS AK 47 TOWARD THE SUNGLASS HUT, THE ONLY THING  THAT WILL STOP HIM FROM CARNAGE  IS WHEN HE ASKS HIMSELF, WHAT  WOULD MOM AND DAD THINK?
Colbert: BUT FOR ALL OF HIS  TRIUMPH OVER THE GOTCHA  QUESTIONS, THE UNFAIR UNRARES,  THE SLIGHTLY TALLER CHAIRS, NONE OF THAT IS HOW MITT WON THIS ONE  .. NO, THIS FIGHT WAS OVER  BEFORE IT BEGAN AS FOX NEWS.COM  TRUMPETED ROMNEY SMOKES OBAMA IN PREDEBATE COIN TOSSES.
YEAH. ROMNEY SMOKED HIM. HE WON THREE OUT OF FOUR COIN  TOSSES. WHAT ARE THE ODDS?  LIKE ONE IN  A MILLION?
COIN TOSS, ALWAYS A HUGE PART  OF THE DEBATES SINCE THE LINCOLN  DOUGLAS ROCK PAPER SCISSORS WENDT ON FOR HOURS WITHOUT A  WINNER THEY HAD TO SETTLE IT AND  ENDED UP FLIPPING A PENNY AND  LINCOLN WON BY CALLING ME!  KNOW THE FOUR FLIPS THAT LAST NIGHT  WERE TO STAGING, ORDER OF  QUESTIONING AND SPOUSES ORDER OF  INTRODUCTION. ROMNEY WON THE COIN TOSSES THE  SAME WAY HE IS WINNING THIS  ELECTION, BY CALLING HEADS OVER  AND OVER AGAIN, THEN CALLING TAILS LIKE HE ALWAYS HAS!   FOLKS, THERE IS A GOOD SIGN,  FOLKS, THIS IS A GOOD SIGN FOR  ROMNEY'S CHANCES WITH UNDECIDED VOTERS, BECAUSE IFFY POINT IN  THE CAMPAIGN YOU ARE STILL  UNDECIDED, JUST FLIP A GODDAMN  COIN ALREADY. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
