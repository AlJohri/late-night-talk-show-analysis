(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A TENNIS LEGEND AND AT THE END OF THE INTERVIEW I'M LEAPING OVER THE DESK. PLEASE WELCOME BILLIE JEAN KING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIT DOWN! THANKS FOR COMING ON.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME!
Stephen: WELL, IT'S A PLEASURE AND HONOR TO HAVE YOU HERE.
AND CAN YOU DANCE, BABY.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU WERE WATCHING ME BACKSTAGE.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU QUITE A BIT EVERY PLACE. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Stephen: WELL, I'M FLATTERED. I'M FLATTERED. BILLIE JEAN, FIRST QUESTION, PHAOEUPBLG SAYS YOU'RE NOT HIS LOVER. MICHAEL JACKSON SAYS YOU'RE NOT HIS LOVER.
NOT THE ONE. YOU KNOW WHO WROTE A SONG FOR ME?
Stephen: WHO?
ELTON JOHN.
THAT'S RIGHT! PHILADELPHIA FREEDOM. THAT GETS TO THE NUT MEAT OF WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HERE. FOR OUR YOUNGER VIEWERS, I WANT THEM TO KNOW WHAT A LEGEND YOU ARE. BECAUSE BESIDES WINNING 39 GRAND SLAM TITLES-- SIX WIMBLEDON SINGLES CHAMPIONSHIPS, FOUR U.S. OPEN TITLES. 40 YEARS AGO THIS MONTH YOU ENGAGED IN SOMETHING CALLED THE BATTLE OF SEXES WITH A GUY NAMED BOBBY RIGGS.
IT WAS HUGE.
Stephen: ENORMOUS.
NO SOCIAL MEDIA, ONLY FOUR CHANNELS, NO CABLE T.V. WHOA! (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: PEOPLE WATCHED IT ALL OVER THE WORLD!
YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IT WAS INCREDIBLE. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. IT WAS LIKE ALI/FRASER, BUT WITH TENNIS. (LAUGHTER)
YES.
Stephen: AND THIS WAS GOING TO SETTLE SOMEHOW WHO'S BETTER-- MEN OR WOMEN.
MEN CAN BEAT WOMEN EVERY TIME AT THE SAME LEVEL. HE WAS AS OLD AS MY FATHER.
Stephen: AND HE WAS TRASH TALKING LEADING UP TO IT.
TOTAL TRASH TALKING. KITCHEN, BAREFOOTED, PREGNANT, GIRLS SHOULD BE IN TWO PLACES, BEDROOMS --
Stephen: BEDROOM AND THE KITCHEN IN THAT ORDER, IS WHAT HE SAID.
BUT I THINK THAT'S A GOOD ORDER. BUT I THINK IT APPLIES FOR WOMEN, TOO, THAT WE'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT AS WELL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EQUAL OPPORTUNITY! EQUAL OPPORTUNITY HERE!
Stephen: NOW THIS -- (LAUGHTER). YOU'VE RATTLED ME. ALL RIGHT.
IMPOSSIBLE! IMPOSSIBLE TO RATTLE YOU.
Stephen: THIS WAS -- THIS WAS DIVIDING FAMILIES. I'M FROM A LOT OF KIDS IN MY FAMILY. MY SISTERS WERE ALL ON YOUR SIDE, MY BROTHERS WERE ALL ON BOBBY RIGGS SIDE AND YOU SMOKED HIM LIKE A HAM. (LAUGHTER) YOU CRUSHED HIM IN THIS. AND THIS BECAME -- YOU BECAME THE BIGGEST NAME IN TENNIS OVERNIGHT.
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
Stephen: NOW YOU'RE THE SUBJECT OF AN "AMERICAN MASTERS" ON PBS.
"AMERICAN MASTERS SERIES" YES.
Stephen: LET'S LOOK AT A CLIP OF THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHEN HE JUMPED OVER THE NET, THE FIRST THING HE SAID TO ME IS "I UNDERESTIMATED YOU." I COULDN'T WAIT TO TELL MY DAD WHAT HE SAID! HE WOULD ALWAYS TELL US "RESPECT YOUR OPPONENTS, NEVER, EVER UNDERESTIMATE THEM." IT WAS LIKE HAVING WON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. EVERYBODY RAN ON THE COURT AND THE WOMEN WERE PUMPED UP AND IT TRANSCENDED TENNIS.
ELATION AND FEELING LIKE EVERY WOMAN AROUND THE WORLD WAS FEELING VINDICATED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I REMEMBER. I REMEMBER VIVIDLY. WE HAD A PARTY AT MY HOUSE.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WERE? IF YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH -- BUT MOST OF YOU ARE NOT. DO YOU REMEMBER WHERE YOU WERE?
WE WERE AT OUR HOUSE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE I WAS. I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO STAY UP LATE ENOUGH TO SEE WHO WON, THOUGH. (LAUGHTER)
WHAT?
Stephen: I HAD TO BE TOLD IN THE MORNING THAT BOBBY RIGGS HAD LOST.
NO, YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A REAL BABY?
Stephen: WELL, I AM SLIGHTLY YOUNGER THAN YOU.
YOU ARE A LOT YOUNGER.
Stephen: WHAT YOU WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE TO BECOME A SYMBOL FOR A MOVEMENT?
I REALLY ACTUALLY EMBRACED IT. I MEAN -- YEAH, I EMBRACED IT.
Stephen: YOU USED YOUR FAME THEN TO START THE --
IT WAS A PLATFORM. TENNIS WAS A PLATFORM FOR ME TO REALLY DO SOMETHING I WANTED TO DO SINCE I WAS 12 YEARS OLD AND THAT IS FIGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEN AND GIRLS, BOYS AND WOMEN. MY OLDER BROTHER WAS A MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYER, RANDY MOFFAT, PLAYED WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS, A RELIEF PITCHER AND A GOOD SLIDER. NOT A GOOD CURVEBALL HE TOLD ME. SO ANYWAY, I ALWAYS -- I ALWAYS WANT BOTH GENDERS TO CHAMPION EACH OTHER. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. I KNOW IT'S IDEALISTIC BUT I DON'T CARE. OUR JOB IN THIS WORLD IS TO HELP EACH OTHER, CHAMPION EACH OTHER AND WE HERE IN THIS WORLD TOGETHER SO LET'S MAKE THE BEST OF IT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THESE DAYS THE ONLY WOMAN WHO REGULARLY COMPETES ON A NATIONAL SCALE WITH MEN IS DANICA PATRICK.
YEAH.
Stephen: ARE YOU UPSET THAT WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER THERE WASN'T GODADDY.COM SO YOU COULD WEAR A LEATHER OUTFIT.
VERY, VERY! OF COURSE I WAS. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE -- NO. I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY -- YOU CONCEALED YOUR -- YOUR SEXUAL PREFERENCE WHEN YOU WERE AT THE HEIGHT OF YOUR FAME. DID IT EVER UPSET YOU WHEN A LINE JUDGE WOULD YELL "OUT!" (LAUGHTER) BILLIE JEAN KING, CONGRATULATIONS ON BAG LIVING LEGEND. THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: BILLIE JEAN KING, "AMERICAN MASTERS"
