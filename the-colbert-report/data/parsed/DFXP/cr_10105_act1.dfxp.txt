TONIGHT SHOCKING NEWS ON CLIMATE CHANGE. TURNS OUT IT WAS EARTH'S CLIMATE THE WHOLE TIME. THEN AMAZON'S LATEST BREAK THROUGH, YOUR BOOK WILL NOW BE DELIVERED AN ACTUAL AMAZON. AND MY GUEST KERI RUSSELL STARS ON FX'S THE AMERICANS, AS A RUSSIAN SPY IN THE 1980s. OR AS THEY CALLED IT BACK THEN, NOW. THE CDC SAYS HALF OF AMERICANS TAKE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE OTHER HALF ARE TOO DRUNK TO OPEN THE CHILDPROOF CAP. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT          Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL WELCOME TO THE REPORT EVERYBODY GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. NATION, LONG-TIME VIEWERS OF THE SHOW WILL KNOW THAT I DON'T LIKE TO HARP ON THE SAME THINGS NIGHT AFTER NIGHT BUT SOME THINGS ARE JUST TOO IMPORTANT. FOR INSTANCE, I HAVE SAID IT MANY TIMES, I AM NO FAN OF POPE FRANCIS. I SAID IT MANY TIMES I'M NO FAN OF POPE FRANCIS. SEE, NOW I'VE SAID, I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES, MANY TIMES. (LAUGHTER) EVER SINCE HE TOOK OVER AT HEAD OF THE CHURCH HE'S BEEN A LITTLE TOO WELCOMING TO ALL GOD'S CHILDREN. JUST LAST YEAR HE SAID EVEN ATHEISTS CAN GO TO HEAVEN. GREAT IDEA, FRANK. FIRST DOGS, NOW ATHEISTS. WHAT IS NEXT, PRESBYTERIANS? IT'S MADNESS. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT ATHEISTS GETTING INTO HEAVEN IS I'D BE ABLE TO WALK UP TO THEM AND SAY I TOLD YOU SO.  THAT IS MY IDEA OF PARADISE. WELL NOW POPE MOONBEAM OVER HERE HAS DRIVEN HIS WELCOME WAGON WHERE NO POPE HAS GONE BEFORE BECAUSE AT MASS ON MONDAY THE PONTIFF SAID IF FOR EXAMPLE TOMORROW AN EXPEDITION OF MARTIANS CAME AND SOME OF THEM CAME TO US HERE, MARTIANS, RIGHT, GREEN, WITH THE LONG NOSE AND BIG EARS JUST LIKE CHILDREN PAINT THEM. AND ONE SAYS BUT I WANT TO BE BAPTIZED. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? WHEN THE LORD SHOWS US THE WAY WHO ARE WE TO SAY NO, LORD, IT'S NOT PRUDENT, NO LET'S DO IT THIS WAY, WHO ARE WE TO CLOSE DOORS. YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT, FOLKS. POPE FRANCIS WOULD BAPTIZE A MARTIAN. OF COURSE FIRST HE'D HAVE TO CONVERT THEM FROM SCIENTOLOGY. NOT THAT I FIND HIS PREMISE IMPLAUSIBLE. IF AN EMISSARY CAME HERE FROM A CULTURE ADVANCED ENOUGH TO TRAVERSE OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, LAND ON OUR PLANET, COMMUNICATE WITH HUMANS, THE VERY FIRST THING IT WOULD DO WOULD BE TO SEEK OUT THE MAN WITH THE FUNNIEST HAT AND ASK HIM FOR A HEAD BATH. BUT BAPTIZING ALIENS IS WAY OVER THE LINES. GOD WAS VERY CLEAR ON THIS POINT IN ISAIAH 45:12. TURN TO ME AND BE SAVED ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH, END OF THE EARTH. IF AN ALIEN WANTS TO BE IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE BY CHRISTIANS ON A KANSAS FARM LIKE CARDINAL SUPERMAN WAS. PLUS ONCE WE BAPTIZE THE ALIENS IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY WANT TO TAKE COMMUNION. AND ASK YOURSELF  DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE THE ONE PLACING A SMALL DELICATE WAFER INTO THIS? GAME OVER, MAN. GAME OVER. NATION, I HAVE SPENT THE LAST WEEK IN A RAGE. OVER THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION'S 800 PAGE NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT THAT CLAIMS WE'RE RUINING THE ENVIRONMENT IT MADE ME SO ANGRY I PRINTED IT FIVE TIMES. NOW ORIGINALLY I DISMISSED IT AS JUST A LAST STOP ON OBAMA'S APOLOGY TOUR. FIRST HE BEGGED FORGIVENESS FROM EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH, NOW HE'S BEGGING FORGIVENESS FROM EARTH? COME ON. THEN I READ THE REPORT AND I HAVE TO ADMIT IT WAS TERRIFYING THAT IT LEFT A CARBON FOOTPRINT IN MY PANTS. JIM?
HUNDREDS OF SCIENTISTS, EXPERTS AND BUSINESSES NOT FOR PROFIT, LOCAL COMMUNITIES, ALL CONTRIBUTED OVER THE COURSE OF FOUR YEARS WHAT THEY FOUND WAS UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT SOME FAR OFF PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE. IT'S HAPPENING NOW.
THE WHITE HOUSE ISSUING A DIRE REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE SUGGESTING THE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS WE ARE SEEING ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE MAN-MADE.
A NEW STUDY SAYS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS BEING FELT TODAY IN ALL 50 STATES.
THE NORTHEAST IS GOING TO SEE MORE HEAT WAVES.
THE MIDWEST WOULD SUFFER MORE DROUGHT FOLLOWED BY FLASH FLOODING.
HURRICANES IN THE SOUTHEAST AND WILDFIRES OUT WEST.
NO REGION OF THE COUNTRY WILL BE SPARED.
NO REGION SPARED. THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WILL BECOME AN UNINHABITABLE WASTELAND NOT JUST BALTIMORE. SO FACING AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS BEYOND ANYTHING HUMANITY HAS EVER KNOWN, WHAT DO WE DO? WELL, THAT QUESTION BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) [BLEEP] IT. NOW FOLKS, FOLKS, GLOBAL WARMING IS BAD. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT. BUT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT IS, AND I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO TECHNICAL HERE, HARD. I AM AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING UP. AND SO THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO PASS THE PROBLEM ALONG TO OUR GRANDCHILDREN, ALONG WITH SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MIDEAST PEACE.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO GRANDKIDS. GET BORN ALREADY. BUT-- IN LIGHT OF THIS NEW REPORT I COULD NO LONGER SIT IDLY BY. I HAD TO TAKE ACTION, CONSERVE ENERGY, DRIVE A TESLA. I EVEN STARTED SORTING, YOU KNOW, MY PAPER FROM MY PLASTIC, YOU KNOW. I HAVE NEVER RECYCLED BEFORE. AND YES, YES, IS THIS SACRIFICE? SURE. BUT MY ONLY CONCERN WAS IS THIS ENOUGH? WELL, ON MONDAY I GOT MY ANSWER.
SCIENTISTS WARN THAT A LARGE PART OF ANTARCTICA IS MELTING AND CANNOT BE STOPPED.
THE GLACIERS ARE ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSING.
40 YEARS OF DATA SHOW THE GLACIERS ARE MELTING SO FAST IT IS NOW UNSTOPPABLE.
SCIENTISTS SAY IT'S TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE MELTING GLACIERS.
[BLEEP] IT. ALL RIGHT IT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
UNSTOPPABLE MELTING. IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS NOW. I MEAN WHAT-- WHAT A RELIEF I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN BUT WE'VE FINALLY RAN THE CLOCK OUT ON THE POSSIBILITY OF MY PERSONAL SACRIFICE MAKING A DIFFERENCE. AND FOLKS, I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE SPREADING THIS MESSAGE OF HOPE. SO IS FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO WHO SAID THIS ON SUNDAY.
I DON'T AGREE WITH THE NOTION THAT SOME ARE PUTTING OUT THERE INCLUDING SCIENTISTS THAT SOMEHOW THERE ARE ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE TODAY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR CLIMATE YES THERE ARE NO ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE TODAY. AN ACTION ON SUNDAY MIGHT HAVE HELPED OR ANY DAY BEFORE THAT, BUT NOW THAT'S ALL WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE. AND TELL THEM WHY TV MAN.
THE THAW COULD TRIGGER RISING SEA LEVELS BY UP TO 12 FEET OVER HUNDREDS OF YEARS. THAT IS ENOUGH TO PUT MIAMI BEACH UNDERWATER.
OKAY, MIAMI. IF YOU LIKE LEBRON JAMES PLAYING BASKETBALL, YOU'LL LOVE HIM PLAYING WATER POLO. SO WHAT NOW? WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY? IF YOU CAN'T STOP CLIMATE CHANGE, LAY BACK AND ENJOY IT. BUT NOW-- NOW THAT IT'S TOTALLY FUTILE, LET'S STOP ARGUING ABOUT DIVISIVE ISSUES LIKE CARBON TAXES, ALTERNATIVE ENERGY OR WALKING. INSTEAD, WE MUST COME TOGETHER AND DO WHAT AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS DONE, WE MUST BURN HYDROCARBONS FOR PLEASURE. AND I BELIEVE THIS FAILURE TO FIND A SOLUTION COULD BE THE SOLUTION TO ALL OUR OTHER FAILURES. DO WE HAVE BAD SCHOOLS? WELL, IF WE DO NOTHING, EVENTUALLY NO ONE WILL KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW. ARE YOU WORRIED? ARE YOU WORRIED? ARE YOU WORRIED THAT MONEY IN POLITICS IS UNDERMINING DEMOCRACY? JUST DO NOTHING AND SOON THERE WILL BE NO DEMOCRACY LEFT TO UNDERMINE. ARE YOU-- AND YOUR LOVED ONE HAVING RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS? JUST DO NOTHING AND THE PROBLEMS WILL GO AWAY ALONG WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP BUT FOLKS, FOR THE RECORD, I WANT TO BE CLEAR, I'M NOT SAYING WE JUST FIDDLE WHILE ROME BURNS. I SAY WE THROW THE FIDDLE ON THE FIRE TUBE. I MEAN THAT FIDDLE IS GOODS KINDLING WHICH WE WILL NEED TO KEEP THE FIRE GOING AS THE FLOODWATERS RISE. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
