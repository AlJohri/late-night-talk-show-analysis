Stephen: TONIGHT A VICTORY FOR ALL RELIGIONS, NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF JESUS YOU BELIEVE IN, THEN A NEW HIGH-TECH WEIGHT LOSS PRODUCT, FINALLY YOU CAN FEEL CYBERFAT. AND MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE THE COHOST OF RADIOLAB WHICH THEY CALL A SHOW ABOUT CURIOUSITY. SO LOCK UP YOUR CATS. MY SHOW WAS NOMINATED FOR 6 EMMYS. AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ALL MY LESBIAN PRISON SEX. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO SEE YOU. FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT'S NOT JUST THE ENERGY IN THIS ROOM. I FEEL IT TOO. YOU KNOW, I LOVE GOING-- I LOVE GOING ON VACATION. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK AFTER TWO WEEKS. I SPENT THE FOURTH OF JULY HOLIDAY CELEBRATING A STEAMY ANNIVERSARY WITH MY LOVER, AMERICA. (LAUGHTER) I GOT HIM THE SAME PRESENT AS EVERY YEAR, SCRAP MEAT AND EXPLOSIVES. BUT SADLY IT WASN'T ALL PARTY TIME. YOU SEE, BEFORE VACATION I WAS SWEPT UP IN WORLD CUP FEVER! RIDING HIGH! RIDING HIGH ON TEAM USA'S THRILLING SERIES OF WINNING, TYING AND LOSING. (LAUGHTER) BUT THEN WE FACED OUR  ETERNAL ENEMY, BELGIUM. OR AS I CALL IT EUROPE RHODE ISLAND. (LAUGHTER) AND THOSE WAFFLE-SUCKING SORT OF FRENCHIES. CRUSHED US LIKE WE WERE THEM IN EVERY WORLD WAR. (LAUGHTER) AND WITH AMERICA OUT OF THE PICTURE IT ALL CAME DOWN TO A DEATH MATCH BETWEEN GERMANY AND ARGENTINA. NATURALLY I ASSUMED IT WOULD BE DECIDED BASED ON WHICH COUNTRY HAS THE MOST LIVING NAZI WAR CRIMINALS. TOO CLOSE TO CALL. SO INSTEAD--  (LAUGHTER) IT WAS DECIDED WITH THE THRILLING SIGHT OF A CHEST VOLLEY GOAL IN EXTRA TIME FOLLOWED BY THE TERRIFYING SIGHT OF GERMANS CELEBRATING VICTORY. 'CAUSE THAT NEVER TURNS BAD. OF COURSE THIS CUP FINAL HAS SPECIAL MEANING IN VATICAN CITY, BECAUSE POPE FRANCIS IS FROM ARGENTINA AND LIVE-IN GRAND POPE BENEDICT IS FROM GERMANY. SO DEUTSCHELAND'S WIN MEANS BENEDICT IS POPE AGAIN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BYE-BYE FRANK. DON'T LET THE 20 FOOT GUILDED DOOR HIT YOU WHERE THE GOOD LORD SPLIT YA. AND NATION IF THERE IS ONE THING I HAVE ALWAYS SAID ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, IS THAT HE'S AN INEFFECTUAL WEAKLING IN MOM JEANS. BUT IF THERE'S A SECOND THING I'VE SAID IT'S THAT HE'S AN IMPERIAL TYRANT WITH AN IRON FIST IN MOM JEANS. (LAUGHTER) AND FACING THE LAST TWO YEARS OF HIS LIFE LONG RULE, OBAMA HAS SWORN TO USE EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO RAM HIS NEFARIOUS AGENDA DOWN AMERICA'S GULLET.
WE ARE NOT JUST GOING TO BE WAITING FOR LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING AMERICANS THE KIND OF HELP THAT THEY NEED. I'VE GOT A PEN AND I'VE GOT A PHONE.
Stephen: HE'S GOT A PEN AND A PHONE. HE'S NOT ONLY ISSUING EXECUTIVE ORDERS, HE'S STEALING OFFICE SUPPLIES. (LAUGHTER) SOMEBODY BETTER GLUE DOWN THE STAPLER IN THE OVAL OFFICE, THEN STAPLE DOWN THE GLUE GUN. NOW FORTUNATELY SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN BOEHNER IS PUTTING AN END TO THIS OVERREACH.
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER SAYS HE IS FILING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ON BEHALF OF CONGRESS. HE'S ACCUSING THE PRESIDENT OF GOING AROUND THE LAW BY USING EXECUTIVE ORDERS.
Stephen: THANK GOD SOMEONE IS FINALLY SUING BARACK OBAMA. THOUGH I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WHOEVER LIVED AT 1601 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. I MEAN THOSE HELICOPTERS HAVE GOT TO BE-- SOME KIND OF NOISE VIOLATION. (LAUGHTER) AND YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT BOEHNER IS SUING OBAMA OVER, UNLESS YOU GUESSED OBAMACARE. (LAUGHTER) JIM?
BOEHNER SAYS PRESIDENT OBAMA OVERSTEPPED HIS AUTHORITY WHEN HE DELAYED THE EMPLOYER MANDATE PORTION OF OBAMACARE WITHOUT FIRST SEEKING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL.
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ARE PLACES WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS BASICALLY REWRITING LAW TO MAKE IT FIT HIS OWN NEEDS.
Stephen: YES. AND CONGRESS CANNOT SIT IDLY BY WHILE THE PRESIDENT REWRITES THEIR LAWS. THEY HAVE TO SIT IDLY BY WHILE THEY NOT WRITE LAWS. AND OBAMA'S OVERUSE OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS IS UNPRECEDENTED IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY IN THAT HE HAS ISSUED FEWER THAN ANY PRESIDENT SINCE FDR. AND DON'T TELL ME THAT EVERY PRESIDENT ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDERS BECAUSE WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON DID NOT SIGN A SINGLE EXECUTIVE ORDER. INSTEAD, THIS GOOD MAN CHOSE TO DIE OF PNEUMONIA 30 DAYS INTO OFFICE. THAT IS CALLED LEADERSHIP. NOW CONSERVATIVES LIKE MYSELF HAVE SUPPORTED A  UNITARY EXECUTIVE AND USE OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS IN THE PAST. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT THAT MAKES THE WHOLE THING SEEM SHADY. (LAUGHTER) SOMETHING-- I'M UPSET TOO. SOMETHING, SOMETHING HE SHARES WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER.
THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF VEHEMENCE IT SEEMS THAT IS DIRECTED AT THE PRESIDENT. THERE'S A CERTAIN RACIAL COMPONENT TO THIS FOR SOME PEOPLE, FOR SOME THERE'S A RACIAL ANIMUS.
Stephen: RACIAL ANIMUS. HOLDER IS SAYING I FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT EXECUTIVE ORDERS BECAUSE OBAMA IS BLACK. AND I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH ERIC HOLDER ON THIS ONE BECAUSE HE MIGHT ACCUSE ME OF RACIAL ANIMUS. THEN I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK UP THE WORD ANIMUS. (LAUGHTER) I THINK IT MEANS BUTTHOLE. (LAUGHTER) WELL-- I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. WELL, HOLDER'S ACCUSATION BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER EDITION OF MY LONG AWARD-LOSING SEGMENT, THANK YOU RACISM. YOU SEE--  (APPLAUSE) LAST WEEK ERIC HOLDER STOOD BY HIS PREVIOUS STATEMENT THAT AMERICANS ARE ESSENTIALLY A NATION OF COWARDS WHEN IT COMES TO TALKING ABOUT RACE. BUT HOLDER COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE LET'S SAY TRUTH. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE I SEE ONLY NOW THAT EXECUTIVE ORDERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WRONG. BUT WITHOUT MY APPARENT DISTRUST OF BLACK PEOPLE I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO SUDDENLY BE MOVED TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION FROM THE OVERREACH I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT BEFORE. NOW, NOW I AM STANDING UP FOR AMERICA OR AGAINST OBAMA, WHATEVER, SAME DIFF. NOW I KNOW I'VE SAID SOME TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT RACISM IN THE PAST, FOLKS. I GUESS-- I GUESS I PREJUDGED RACISM WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING IT. (LAUGHTER) AND FOR THAT I'M SORRY, RACISM. NOW FOLKS, SOME SAY THAT BOEHNER'S LAWSUIT IS A LONG SHOT BUT I SAY IT'S A LONG SLAM-DUNK BECAUSE WHILE I WAS BALLS DEEP IN COBBLER  ON THE FOURTH, I WAS UP TO THE BLUEBERRIES, I LEARNED THAT I NO LONGER HAVE TO PAY FOR SLUT PILLS AKA WHORE PELLETS AKA VITAMIN BOW CHICKA BOWWOW. JIM?
THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES DELIVERED A MAJOR BLOW TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE LAW TODAY IN A MAJOR VICTORY FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. IN A 5-4 DECISION THE JUSTICES RULED IN FAVOR OF THE HOBBY LOBBY CRAFT CHAIN SAYING THAT CLOSELY HELD CORPORATIONS CAN IN FACT, OPT OUT OF THE OBAMACARE CONTRACEPTION MANDATE DUE TO RELIGIOUS OBJECTIONS.
THIS IS A BIG VICTORY FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.
A VICTORY FOR COMMON SENSE.
VICTORY FOR TRADITIONAL AMERICANS.
VICTORY SO, BREAK OUT THE CHAMPAGNE BUT NOT TOO MUCH, HOBBY LOBBY EMPLOYEES BECAUSE YOUR BIRTH CONTROL IS NO LONGER COVERED. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. BE CAREFUL, PLEASE, SET YOUR HUMPING TO DRY. (APPLAUSE)
YES IN A UNANIMOUS 5-4 DECISION THE SUPREME COURT CATHOLIC MEN HAVE RULED THAT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CONTRACEPTION DOES NOT TRUMP HER EMPLOYER'S RIGHT TO BELIEVE SHE SHOULDN'T BE TAKING IT. AND IT'S BASED ON THE SOUND PRINCIPLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO FORCE CLOSELY HELD CORPORATIONS TO VIOLATE THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. OH AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT A BIG DEAL BUT THEY ALSO RULED THAT CORPORATIONS HAVE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. I MEAN IT MAKES SENSE. HOBBY LOBBY OBVIOUSLY CHRISTIAN, PANDA EXPRESS IS JEWISH AT CHRISTMASTIME, AND PAPA JOHN'S OF COURSE IS ATHEIST BECAUSE THEIR PIZZA MAKES YOU DOUBT THERE IS A GOD. (APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
