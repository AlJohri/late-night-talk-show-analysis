(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. NATION, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW  YOU KNOW I AM A PATRIOTIC  AMERICAN WHO TAKES A MOMENT EACH DAY TO SAVOR GEORGE WASHINGTON  HANDING THE LIMEMYS THEIR  CRUMPETS AT YORKTOWN! HAY, BRITS, SIT ON THIS! SO I MEAN IT WITH EVERY FIBER OF  MY IRISH BEING WHEN I SAY KATE  IS PREGGERS. OH, MY GOD! THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. YOU ARE MY QUEEN! (LAUGHTER)  AND THE NEXT SIX MONTHS ARE  GOING TO BE SO EXCITING. I WONDER WHAT THEY'LL NAME IT. IF IT'S A BOY WILL THEY GO WITH  ARTHUR GEORGE EDWARD WILLIAM? BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE A STRONG  CASE FOR WILLIAM ARTHUR EDWARD  GEORGE. (LAUGHTER)  SO THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO  EDGY. HE'D GET TEASED BY HIS  SCHOOLMATES SLASH SUBJECTS. IF IT'S A GIRL THEY'D HAVE TO  HONOR WILLIAM'S MOTHER SO SHE  MIGHT BE NAMED PRINCESS DIANA (BLEEP) CAMILLA. (LAUGHTER)  OF COURSE (BLEEP), (BLEEP),  (BLEEP) CAMILLA. HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THAT  CORRECTLY. OF COURSE EVEN KATE THE GREAT IS  ONLY HUMAN AND ELEGANT ANGELIC  HUMAN WHOSE EFFORTLESS GRACE IS A BEACON TO THE WORLD. (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS STARTING OUT AS A BIT OF  A BUMPY RIDE.
THE DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE IS  IN THIS HOSPITAL STILL SUFFERING  FROM WHAT WE'RE TOLD IS ACUTE MORNING SICKNESS.
IT'S MORN LIKE MORNING, NOON,  AND NIGHT SICKNESS.
IT'S EXTREME VOMITING DURING  PREGNANCY.
Stephen: NOW THIS MORNING  SICKNESS PROBABLY MEANS SHE'LL  RESTRICT HERSELF TO A BLAND DIET OTHERWISE KNOWN AS FOOD IN  ENGLAND. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, AS YOU KNOW, FOLKS, AFTER  A SERIES OF ETIQUETTE LESSONS  WITH BRITISH ROYAL OBSERVER HUGO VICARS, I WAS INVITED TO WILL  ABDICATE'S GALA WEDDING-- IN THE  SENSE THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW I WAS HIDING IN THE PIPE ORGAN. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, FOLKS, I HAVE A TREAT FOR  YOU TONIGHT BECAUSE THANKS TO MY  CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY I WAS ABLE TO  SCORE AN EXCLUSIVE PHONE CALL  WITH THE DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE  HERSELF. PLEASE WELCOME KATE MIDDLETON,  EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WELCOME. WELCOME, DUCHESS. IT REALLY IS AN HONOR. YOU ARE CARRYING THE HEIR TO THE  BRITISH THRONE. YOU MUST FEEL RADIENT.
(DRY HEAVING)
Stephen: AND I MUST ASK-- AND  I HOPE THIS ISN'T  OUT-OF-BOUNDS-- DO YOU AND WILL KNOW YET IF IT'S A LITTLE PRINCE  OR PRINCESS.
(VOMITING)
Stephen: IT'S LIKE A FAIRY  TALE TALE! LET'S TALK MATERNITY FASHIONS. WHO WILL YOU BE WEARING AS YOU  APPROACH THE BIG DAY?
(VIOLENT VOMITING AND HEAVY  BREATHING)
Stephen: I LOVE THE  PAGEANTRY. WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,  YOUR HIGHNESS, KATE MIDDLETON,  EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SHE MAKES EVERYTHING MAGICAL. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, YOU HEARD IT HERE, FOLKS,  THIS YEAR'S HOT LOOK WILL BE DRY  HEAVING. AND I FOR ONE CANNOT WAIT TO GET  PRINCESS KATE'S COMMEMORATIVE  BARF BAGS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
