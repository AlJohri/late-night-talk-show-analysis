[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, AS MEMBERS OF THE COLBERT  NATION, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU  THAT BARACK OBAMA LOVES BIG  GOVERNMENT. NEED PROOF? IN 1790 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  HAD POWER OVER 13 STATES. UNDER OBAMA? 50. AND SURPRISE, SURPRISE, THE LAST  ONE IS HAWAII. FROM THERE MUCH? WELL, BRACE YOURSELF, FOLKS. OBAMA IS AT IT AGAIN.
A SEEMINGLY WELL INTENTIONED  GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE IS RAISING  SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT BIG  BROTHER. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW  HIRING BEHAVIORAL EXPERTS TO  LOOK FOR WAYS TO INFLUENCE AMERICANS' BEHAVIOR.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THE WHITE HOUSE IS HIRING  BEHAVIORAL EXPERTS. AND THIS TIME IT'S NOT TO GET  JOE BIDEN TO STOP DRINKING OUT  OF THE TOILET. SEE, THE ADMINISTRATION IS  TRYING OUT A PSYCHOLOGY TRICK  CALLED A NUDGE WHICH ENCOURAGES BEHAVIOR SUBTLY RATHER THAN  OUTRIGHT REQUIRES IT. NOW A NUDGE IS IS NOT TO BE  CONFUSED WITH SOMEONE FORCING  YOU TO DO SOMETHING AT GUN  POINT. THAT'S CALLED A NUGE. AND LIKE ALL OF OBAMA'S IDEAS,  FOLKS, HE GOT THIS ONE FROM OUR  ENEMIES IN EUROPE. FOR INSTANCE, IN AMSTERDAM'S  SKIP-OLE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT  MANAGEMENT PAINTED PICTURES OF HOUSE FLIES ON THE URINALS IN  THE MEN'S ROOM AND THE QUANTITY  OF MISDIRECTED URINE IS SAID TO HAVE FALLEN BY 80%. ALTHOUGH, YES, IMPRESSIVE. ALTHOUGH THE QUANTITY OF  SUICIDES BY GOVERNMENT URINE  TRACKERS SKYROCKETED. FOLKS, THIS NUDGING IS NOTHING  MORE THAN OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  CONTROLLING US WITH GUILT. THIS IS WORSE THAN BIG BROTHER. THIS IS BIG MOTHER. BEFORE LONG, YOU WILL BE GETTING  US TO CONSERVE ELECTRICITY LIKE  THIS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE A COMPACT  FLUORESCENT BULB IF YOU DON'T  WANT TO. IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU'VE GOT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS  TO DO. I'LL JUST SIT HERE IN THE DARK  NO, NO, I'LL DO IT. NO, I'M USEDDED TO THE DARK. WHEN I WAS IN LABOR WITH YOU, I  HAD MY EYES CLENCHED SHUT FOR  THE ENTIRE 28 HOURS. IT WAS LIKE BEING BURIED. PLEASE, JUST LET ME PUT THE BULB  IN. NO, YOU JUST GO OUT WITH THAT  GIRL AND HAVE FUN. YOUR FATHER WOULD PUT THEM IN  BUT HE'S GONE NOW. HE SAID HE WOULD TAKE CARE OF ME  BUT I GUESS THAT WAS JUST BETH  DEAD TALK. I'M GETTING THE LADDER. ARE YOU SURE? I WANT TO CHANGE THE BULB. AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO THERE'S A  CRATE OF BULBS OUT IN THE  GARAGE. THANK YOU, DARLING. WE'LL BE RIGHT
