Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW-- AND I HOPE YOU DO-- DO YOU KNOW THAT WE AT "THE REPORT" ARE LASER FOCUSED ON THE TRUTH. AND THAT MEANS OBSESSIVE FACT CHECKING. WE CHECK EVERY EPISODE AND IF WE FIND A FACT, WE REPLACE IT WITH THE TRUTH. (LAUGHTER) UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, NOT ALL NEWS ORGANIZATIONS OUT THERE ARE UP TO OUR STANDARDS. THERE IS A SCANDAL TEARING APART CBS NEWS, HOME OF EDWARD R. MURROW, WALTER CRONKITE AND JULIE CHEN. (LAUGHTER) SEEN HERE REPORTING ON THE "PIRATES OF PENZANCE." (LAUGHTER) YOU SEE, TWO WEEKS AGO, CBS NEWS' THE "60 MINUTES" TOOK TIME OFF FROM DOING IN-DEPTH BUDDY CURLS WITH WOLVERINE TO BLOW THE LID OFF BENGHAZI-GATE. WHEN THE ATTACKS IN LIBYA OCCURRED, "60 MINUTES" WAS ON THE SCENE WITHIN MINUTES OF 13 MONTHS LATER. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, FOX NEWS HAS BEEN WORKING THIS STORY FOR A YEAR, HAVING DEFINITIVELY PROVEN THAT TRAGEDY SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING HILLARY CLINTON. (LAUGHTER) THE ONE THING THEY DID NOT HAVE, THE ONE THING THEY LACKED WAS AN EYEWITNESS. WELL, TWO WEEKS AGO, THE "60 MINUTES" INTERVIEWED SECURITY CONTRACTOR MORGAN JONES.
MORGAN JONES' JOB WAS TRAINING THE UNARMED GUARDS WHO MANNED THE COMPOUND'S GATES. A SECOND LIBYAN FORCE, AN ARMED MILITIA HIRED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT, WAS SUPPOSED TO DEFEND THE COMPOUND IN THE EVENT OF AN ATTACK.
I WAS SAYING THESE GUYS ARE NO GOOD, YOU NEED TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE.
YOU ALSO KEPT SAYING "IF THIS PLACE IS ATTACKED THESE GUYS ARE NOT GOING TO STAND AND FIGHT."
YEAH, I USED TO SAY IT ALL THE TIME. IN THE END I GOT QUITE BORED OF HEARING MY OWN VOICE SAYING IT.
Stephen: DAMNING TESTIMONY FROM THE HERO WHO WAS THERE THE NIGHT OF THE ATTACK.
MORGAN JONES SCALED THE 12-FOOT-HIGH WALL OF THE COMPOUND THAT WAS STILL OVERRUN WITH AL QAEDA FIGHTERS.
ONE GUY SAW ME. HE -- HE JUST SHOUTED -- I COULDN'T BELIEVE HE'D SOON ME BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK. HE STARTED WALKING TOWARDS ME.
AND AS HE WAS COMING CLOSER --
AS I GOT CLOSER I JUST HIT HIM WITH THE BUTT OF THE RIFLE IN THE FACE.
AND?
HE WENT DOWN.
Stephen: FOLKS, WHAT MORE IS THERE TO SAY THAN BENGHAZI, BENGHAZI, BENGHAZI! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE!
MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTRAGE OVER THE BENGHAZI TERROR ATTACKS BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT NEW FOR YOU OUT THERE, OUR VIEWERS, BECAUSE THE WRENCHING REPORT ON "60 MINUTES" LAST NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH INFORMATION FOX UNCOVERED MONTHS AGO.
I THINK IT'S GREAT MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS FINALLY CATCHING UP. CBS DID THIS STORY ON BENGHAZI AND I SEE CRITICISM FROM THE LEFT WHERE THEY GO YOU GUYS ARE COVERING A PHONY SCANDAL. "60 MINUTES" DOESN'T COVER PHONY SCANDALS.
Stephen: YES, ANOTHER NETWORK COVERED IT. THAT'S HOW YOU FOE FOX NEWS' REPORTING IS ACCURATE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S JUST LIKE THEIR MOTTO "WE REPORT, BUT YOU SHOULD REALLY CHECK WITH SOMEONE ELSE." (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) ALSO, CBS SHOULD HAVE CHECKED WITH SOMEONE ELSE BECAUSE MORGAN JONES' STORY TURNED OUT TO BE TOTALLY FAKE. INCLUDING HIS NAME, WHICH IS NOT MORGAN JONES BUT DYLAN DAVIES, WHICH ACTUALLY SOUNDS EVEN MORE FAKE. (LAUGHTER) IN FACT, IN HIS INCIDENT REPORT TO HIS EMPLOYER DAVIES WROTE HE SPENT MOST OF THE NIGHT AT HIS BENGHAZI BEACH SIDE VILLA NOWHERE NEAR THE EMBASSY. EVIDENTLY THE GUY HE HIT IN THE FACE WITH THE BUTT OF HIS RIFLE THAT NIGHT WAS A CAB THAT BOY. (LAUGHTER) AND, GOD, I HOPE IT WAS HIS RIFLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW CBS KNEW DAVIES HAD LIED TO HIS EMPLOYER BUT BELIEVED THE HEROIC VERSION HE TOLD THEM BECAUSE THEIR SOURCES LED THEM TO BELIEVE THAT DAVIES' F.B.I. REPORT WAS IN SYNC WITH WHAT HE TOLD "60 MINUTES." OR HE MIGHT HAVE TOLD THE F.B.I. THAT HE WAS THE LEAD SINGER OF 'N SYNC. IT'S NOT CLEAR. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE LATER THE "NEW YORK TIMES" CHECKED WITH THE F.B.I. AND DAVIES' F.B.I. TESTIMONY IS NOT WHAT HE TOLD "60 MINUTES." SO CBS NEWS QUICKLY CHECKED ITS OWN F.B.I. SOURCES AND LEARNED WHAT MR. DAVIES TOLD THE F.B.I. DIFFERD FROM WHAT HE TOLD US. SO CBS FACT CHECKED THE STORY BUT WHEN IT TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG THEY FACT CHECKED IT FOR REALS, Y'ALL! (LAUGHTER) AND ON LAST NIGHT THE "60 MINUTES," LARA LOGAN ADDRESSED THE CONTROVERSY HEAD ON AT THE VERY TOP OF THE LAST MINUTE OF THE SHOW. (LAUGHTER)
WE END OUR BROADCAST TONIGHT WITH A CORRECTION ON A STORY WE REPORTED OCTOBER 27. WE REALIZED WE HAD BEEN MISLED AND IT WAS A MISTAKE TO INCLUDE HIM IN OUR REPORT. FOR THAT, WE ARE VERY SORRY. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO EVERY PERSON AT "60 MINUTES" IS THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH IS WE MADE A MISTAKE.
Stephen: FOLKS, I'M NOT BUYING THIS. CBS IS GOOD AT JOURNALISM. THERE'S ONLY ONE LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR WHAT REALLY HAPPENED HERE. HILLARY CLINTON GOT TO THEM! (LAUGHTER) YOU SEE, FOLKS, AS YOU WELL KNOW BUT I WILL REPEAT AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE, HILLARY CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE DURING THE BENGHAZI ATTACKS! I MEAN, THAT'S HER OFFICIAL PHOTO. (LAUGHTER) ERGO, QUID PRO QUO, AM BUS BRIEF, SHE IS TO BLAME. AND NOW N.O.W. SHE'S SO HUNGRY FOR POWER IN 2016 THAT SHE'S SOMEHOW CONVINCED "60 MINUTES" TO AIR THIS FALSE BENGHAZI APOLOGY TO DISCREDIT THEIR INVESTIGATION! AND WE HERE AT THE "THE COLBERT REPORT" HAVE NOW FOUND AN EYEWITNESS WITH STARTLING NEW DETAILS CONCERNING THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGIC CBS/BENGHAZI APOLOGY. JIM? I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE A COLLEGE INTERN AT "60 MINUTES." (LAUGHTER)
YES. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, ARE YOU USING AN ALIAS TONIGHT? WHAT IS THAT?
PONCHO DENEWS. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: NOW, PONCHO, YOU WERE INTERNING THE NIGHT ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE AT "60 MINUTES."
YES, STEPHEN, I WAS DEFINITELY THERE THAT NIGHT BECAUSE I'M AN ACTUAL HUMAN WITNESS. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: TELL US WHAT HAPPENED, PANCHO.
WELL, I WAS COMING BACK FROM GETTING CHEWING TOBACCO FOR FOR LESLEY STAHL WHEN I HEARD EXPLOSIONS OF SHOUTING.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT?
I RAN TOWARDS IT. I SCALED THE 30-FOOT WALL SURROUNDING THE NEWSROOM. (LAUGHTER) ONCE I LANDED, A SHADOWY FIGURE RAN TOWARDS ME SO I KNOCKED HIM OUT WITH THE BUTT OF MY HARPOON GUN. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: WHO WAS THAT?
TURNS OUT IT WAS MORLEY SAFER. (LAUGHTER) BUT THEN I TURNED AROUND AND I SAW -- AND I SAW --
Stephen: WHO DID YOU SEE?
IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON. (LAUGHTER) SHE WAS SWINGING A BIKE CHAIN AND YELLING "WE'RE HERE TO KILL THE STORY! WHO WANTS TO EAT SOME CHAIN?" (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THEN SHE PISTOL WHIPPED MORLEY SAFER. (LAUGHTER) WHICH WAS CRUEL SINCE HE WAS ALREADY UNCONSCIOUS.
Stephen: SO IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON WHO MADE CBS APOLOGIZE?
YES!
Stephen: I KNEW IT! ANYTHING ELSE?
YEAH, STEPHEN, I HAVE ONE MORE EXCLUSIVE. I'M NOT REALLY "60 MINUTES" INTERN PONCHO DENEWS. I'M CHARLIE SKINNER OF ATLANTIS CABLE NEWS CHANNEL AS PROFILED IN THE HBO DOCUMENTARY "THE NEWS." (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHAT? WHERE DID THAT COLLEGE INTERN GO?
THERE WAS NEVER ANY INTERN, STEPHEN! I DID IT TO PROVE A POINT THAT AS JOURNALISTS WE ARE THE GATEKEEPERS OF TRUTH! WE SEPARATE RIGHT FROM WRONG; FACT FROM FICTION, DELICATE FROM PERMANENT PRESS! I RECALL A MAN WHO SAID WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. THAT MAN WAS SPIDER-MAN'S UNCLE. (LAUGHTER) AND NOW HE'S DEAD! THE PUBLIC NEEDS US TO BE THE WATCHDOGS OF DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CRITICIZE OUR LEADERS WITHOUT A PROEFP, REPORT NATIONAL SECRETS WITHOUT FEAR OF IMPRISONMENT. IF WE VIOLATE THIS CONTACT, THIS PUBLIC TRUST --
Stephen: HOW MUCH LONGER?
ALMOST DONE. THEN WE WILL HAVE A PUPPET PRESS OFS HERE, INNUENDO, HYPERBOLE AND NONSENSE. DING-DONG, WHO IS IT? IT'S DOMINOES! BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S THE THROAT! DELIVERED HOT AND CRUSTY OR YOUR MONEY BACK! THAT'S THE GUARANTEE WE MAKE AMERICA EVERY NIGHT OTHERWISE THE WORLD IS JUST CRAZY BREAD. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: TECHNICALLY, CRAZY BRETT IS LITTLE CESARS.
IT'S CALLED POETIC LICENSE, GODDAMNIT!
Stephen: YOU'RE RIGHT, THE NEWSROOM'S CHARLIE SKINNER. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO. WE END OUR THIS PART OF THE SHOW WITH A CORRECTION. IN OUR REPORT TONIGHT, A MAN NAMED PONCHO DENEWS CLAIMED HE WAS A "60 MINUTES" INTERN AND WE BELIEVED HIM BECAUSE HE HAD AN I.D. LANYARD. (LAUGHTER) FOLLOWING THE REPORT, THE "WASHINGTON POST", THE "NEW YORK TIMES," AND THE "TV GUIDE" ALL REPORTED THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY THE ACTOR SAM WATERSTON STAR OF -- "THE PLASTIC DOME OF NORMA JEAN." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOOK IT UP. LOOK IT UP. WE CHECKED WITH OUR SOURCES AT IMDB AND IT TURNS OUT WE MADE A MISTAKE. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE USED HIM IN OUR REPORT AND FOR THAT WE'RE VERY SORRY. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO EVERYONE HERE AT THE "THE COLBERT REPORT" IS THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH IS, IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
