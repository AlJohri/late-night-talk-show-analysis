(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: WHOO! WHOO! NUMBER ONE! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: WHOO! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, IT IS FANTASTIC TO HAVE YOU HERE! IT IS SO EXCITING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW, NATION, I'M SURE YOU CAN TELL FROM THE EXCITEMENT IN THIS ROOM WE ARE ENTERING THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF MY SHOW, AND I PLEDGE TO YOU THAT I WILL STAY STRONG ON FAMILY VALUES TO THE BITTER END. SINCE DAY ONE OF THIS PROGRAM, I'VE HAD AN UNSHAKEABLE STANCE ON GAY MARRIAGE. IT IS A MORAL EVIL THAT THREATENS OUR SACRED INSTITUTIONS, OUR FAMILIES AND LIVES UNTIL IT BECAME POPULAR AND THEN, SINCE THEN, WHO KNOWS. YOU KNOW, TO EACH HIS OWN. YOU KNOW, NONE OF MY BUSINESS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MIGHT EVEN OFFICIATE AT A WEDDING SOME DAY, WHO KNOWS? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND EVERY DAY, THERE'S ANOTHER REASON FOR ME TO NOT GIVE A WHAT EVS >>IT'S A BIG WEEK FOR GAY RIGHTS AND COUPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN TYING THE KNOT AFTER A SERIES OF COURT RULINGS AT BOTH THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL MADE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE LEGAL IN A MAJORITY OF STATES.
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE MAY SOON BE LEGAL IN 35 STATES.
SUPPORTERS OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE SUPPORTING ANOTHER LEGAL VICTORY THIS MORNING. A FEDERAL JUDGE STRIKING DOWN ALASKA'S BAN ON GAY MARRIAGE.
Stephen: YEAH, GAY MARRIAGE IS LEGAL IN ALASKA. NOW GAY COUPLES WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO CELEBRATE THE TRADITIONAL ALASKAN WAY BY HAVING BRISTOL PALIN COLD-COCK ONE OF THEIR GUESTS. (LAUGHTER) AS MUCH AS I LOVE AMERICA, AS A PERSON OF FAITH, ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS TO ME IS THE POSITION OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN, GUY ON GIRL, LIGHTS ON, A LITTLE WEEPING, A LITTLE PRAYING, AND STRAIGHT TO SLEEP. UNTIL NOW.
NEWS FROM THE VATICAN, WIDELY DESCRIBED AS SOMETHING OF AN EARTHQUAKE FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
A STUNNING SHIFT BY THE VATICAN ON APPROACH TO GAYS AND LESBIANS.
BISHOPS DRAFTED NEW LANGUAGE ON THE CHURCH'S ATTITUDE TOWARD HOMOSEXUALITY
THE VATICAN URGED PASTORS TO BE MORE WELCOMING TO GAYS
Stephen: OH MY GOD IN THREE PERSONS! THE VATICAN IS WELCOMING THE GAYS IN? NEXT THING YOU KNOW THE PLACE WILL BE FILLED WITH ANTIQUES! JUST LISTEN TO THE IMMORAL, DEPRAVED  SUPPORT THE VATICAN OFFERS IN THIS DOCUMENT: "HOMOSEXUALS  HAVE GIFTS AND QUALITIES TO OFFER THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY." OKAY, THEY HAVE GIFTS BUT IT'S MOSTLY KIMONOS AND I'M ALWAYS FEELING LIKE I'M IN A BATHROBE. THE DOCUMENT GOES ON TO ASK  IF THE CHURCH IS CAPABLE OF  WELCOMING GAY PEOPLE AND GUARANTEEING THEM FRATERNAL SPACE IN OUR COMMUNITIES." FRATERNAL SPACE? AREN'T OUR FRATS ALREADY GAY ENOUGH? LISTEN UP POPE FABULOUS I, THE LORD IS PERFECTLY CLEAR ON THE GAYS. THE FIRST TIME HE SAW A NAKED DUDE RUNNING AROUND, HE RIBBED OUT HIS RIB AND FORCED HIM TO HAVE SEX WITH A WOMAN. AND HE WAS PRETTY CLEAR WITH HER, TOO, NO FRUITY STUFF! NATION, I'M SO EXCITED, THE MID-TERMS ARE ALMOST HERE. IT'S JUST LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING WITH MORE TALK ABOUT JESUS. WITH 21 DAYS LEFT BEFORE THE ELECTION, THERE'S ONE VOTING GROUP THE G.O.P. IS TRYING TO STILL WOO, AND THAT'S WOO-MEN!
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS IN WORSE SHAPE WITH WOMEN THAN IN 2010.
REPUBLICANS AND WOMEN, IT'S BEEN A MESSAGE PROBLEM.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS A PROBLEM COMMUNICATING WITH WOMEN.
STUDY ORDERED BY TWO REPUBLICAN GROUPS FOUND FEMALE VOTERS FEEL THE PARTY IS STUCK IN THE PAST, SAID THE G.O.P. IS INTOLERANT AND LACKS COMPASSION.
Stephen: OK THE G.O.P. HAS PROBLEMS COMMUNICATING WITH WOMEN BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T CARE. THEY'RE JUST LIKE THAT SHY KID AT THE DANCE WHO WANTS TO GET  YOUR ATTENTION BY DENYING YOU EQUAL PAY. IT MEANS HE LIKES YOU. (LAUGHTER) FORTUNATELY, ONE G.O.P. GROUP DEVELOPED A CAMPAIGN THAT'S SURE TO WIN THE LADY VOTE, THE COLLEGE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE OR CRNC! THEY CREATED AN AD FOR THE HEATED FLORIDA GOVERNOR'S RACE  BETWEEN DEMOCRAT CHALLEGER AND PARBOILED AMERICAN CHARLIE CRIST AND REPUBLICAN AND NAKED MOLE RAT RICK SCOTT. THE AD ASKS WOMEN TO MAKE NOVEMBER 4 THE MOST MAGICAL DAY OF THEIR LIVES.
THE BUDGET IS A BIG DEAL FOR ME NOW THAT I JUST  GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE.
THE RICK SCOTT IS PERFECT! RICK SCOTT HAS BECOME THE TRUSTED BRAND. HE HAS NEW IDEAS THAT DON'T BREAK THE BUDGET.
THEY ARE IMITATING THE POPULAR TLC SHOW "SAY YES TO THE DRESS" TO APPEAL TO THE FEMALE VOTERS IN THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD APPEAL TO VETERANS WITH CUPCAKE WARS. IN THIS AD, EACH CANDIDATE IS METAPHORICALLY REPRESENTED BY A DIFFERENT WEDDING DRESS AND THE BRIDE LOOKS RADIANT IN THE RICK SCOTT BUT MOM HAS OTHER IDEAS.
I LIKE THE CHARLIE CRIST. IT'S EXPENSIVE AND A LITTLE OUTDATED, BUT I KNOW BEST.
DON'T FORGET, THE CHARLIE CRIST COMES WITH ADDITIONAL COST. THERE'S OVER $2 BILLION IN TAXES.
MOM, THIS IS MY DECISION. I SEE A BETTER FUTURE WITH RICK SCOTT.
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO LET GO OF OLD STYLE BUT IT ALL WORKS OUT IN THE END BECAUSE SHE SAID YES TO RICK SCOTT! (CHEERING)
Stephen: THIS AD IS I KNOW, IT'S TOUCHING, ISN'T IT? AWWW! PASSED WITH WITH ALL KIND OF CLASSIC CONSERVATIVE MARRIAGE. TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE, FISCAL CONSERVATISM AND HATING MOM. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT G.O.P. ADS TELLING BASEBALL AND APPLE PIE TO GO (BLEEP) THEMSELVES. THIS AD -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS AD -- THIS AD SHOWS THAT THE MODERN G.O.P. FINALLY UNDERSTANDS THE REAL CONCERNS OF WOMEN -- WEDDINGS! I MEAN, WHO NEEDS ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION OR EQUAL PAY. YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED. LET HIM TAKE CARE OF THAT HARD STUFF. OF COURSE, THERE ARE A LOT OF RACES THIS IS YEAR SO THEY HAVE CUSTOM FITNESS ADD FOR BLUSHING VOTERS NATIONWIDE.
TOM CORBETT IS PERFECT. THE RICK SNYDER IS PERFECT. THE ASA HUTCHINSON IS PERFECT. THE BRUCE RAUNER IS PERFECT.
Stephen: IT'S A NICE DRESS BUT TRYING OUT THAT MANY  CANDIDATES DISQUALIFIES HER FROM WEARING WHITE (CHEERS)
Stephen: I'M SO INSPIRED BY THIS APPEAL TO THE LADIES THAT I'VE CREATED MY OWN AD I BELIEVE ADDRESSES THE REAL CONCERNS OF YOUNG, SINGLE WOMEN. JIM? ♪♪
WOW! YOU ARE LOOKING CONFIDENT AND SELF-ASSURED.
I AM. EVEN THOUGH RIGHT NOW IT'S "THAT TIME."
MID TERM? YEAH. ME, TOO! I DON'T HAVE YOUR CONFIDENCE. WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?
WELL, I'M BEING PROTECTED BY RICK SCOTT IN MY PRIVATE SECTOR.
THAT EXPLAINS IT. I'M STILL USING... CHARLIE CRIST.
IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS SINCE HE WAS GOVERNOR. HE COULD NEVER GIVE YOU THAT FRESH FEELING. JUST LOOK AT THIS SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON. UNDER CHARLIE CRIST, TAXPAYER DOLLARS WILL BE LEAKING EVERYWHERE. BUT RICK SCOTT KEEPS YOUR TAX DOLLARS WHERE THEY BELONG, EVEN ON HEAVY SPENDING DAYS.
BUT WHERE DOES SCOTT STAND ON EMPLOYERS PROVIDING COVERAGE FOR CONTRACEPTIVES?
LET'S JUST RIDE OUR BIKES.
RICK SCOTT, THE BEST CANDIDATE.
PERIOD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AND, LADIES... IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR EVEN MORE FRESHNESS, DON'T WORRY. THE G.O.P. ALSO HAS A FULL LINE OF DOUCHE BAGS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
