WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN PROFESSOR WITH THE NEW BOOK THE STORY OF THE HUMAN BODY EVOLUTION, HEALTH AND DISEASE.
I PICKED HEALTH.
PLEASE WELCOME DANIEL LIEBERMAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU, HOW ARE YOU, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, DANIEL. ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE SHOW BEFORE, TALKED ABOUT BAREFOOT RUN LAST TIME.
YES.
IT IS GETTING COLD, I PREFER TO WEAR SOCKS WHEN IT IS COLD. I'M JUST GETTING OLD AND THE OLDER YOU GET THE MORE A CRAVE WARMTH.
Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MOD HIRNL DOES THAT OLD HUMANS DIDN'T DO, WE GET OLD, RIGHT. THAT'S ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES WE HAVE OVER THEM, WE CAN JUST, IN A FIGHT WE CAN JUST OUTLAST THEM.
THAT'S TRUE.
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE HUNTERS GATHERERS, NASTY MISERABLE LIVES.
Stephen: THEY DID.
WELL, ACTUALLY, THE HUNTER GATHERERS IF THEY SURVIVED CHILDHOOD THEY HAD PRETTY HIGH CHILDHOOD MORTALITY RATES BUT IF THEY SURVIVED THEY LIVED TO THEIR 60s, 70s AND 80s AND WERE EXTRAORDINARILY HEALTHY AS FAR AS WE COULD TELL. THEY HAD HEART DISEASE. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TYPE II DIABETES. OSTEOPOROSIS. WE'VE GOT THEM ALL.
Stephen: WE GOT THAT ON THEM.
YEAH.
Stephen: THEY ONLY HAD ONE TYPE OF DIABETES.
THEY NEVER NEEDED OBAMACARE. YEAH, BECAUSE THEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY LIVED PRETTY LONG AND VERY HEALTHY LIVES. AND ALTHOUGH THEY DID GET SICK, THEY DIDN'T GET THE KIND OF CHRONIC NONINFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT WE GET TODAY.
Stephen: WELL, EVERYTHING YOU ARE SAYING, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU BUT EVERYTHING ARE YOU SAYING IS IN YOUR NEW BOOK THE STORY OF THE HUMAN BODY, EVOLUTION, HEALTH AND DISEASE. IS OUR BODY, ARE OUR BODIES CHANGING NOW.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT EVOLUTION WAS SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
WELL, TO SOME EXTENT IT IS, YES. SO EVOLUTION IS, OCCURS IN MULTIPLE WAYS. ONE KIND OF EVOLUTION IS THAT, NATURAL SELECTION WHAT DARWIN WROTE ABOUT, THERE IS VARIATION, SOME OF THE VARIATIONS LIKE YOU PROBABLY LOOK A BIT LIKE YOUR PARENTS I IMAGINE BECAUSE YOU INHERITED GENES FROM THEM. AND THEN LOTS OF SIBLINGS, SOME OF YOU INHERITED DIFFERENT GENES FROM YOUR PARENTS THAN OTHER ONES AND SOME HAD MORE KIDS THAN OTHERS. AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAD GENES THAT BENEFITTED YOU IN TERMS OF HAVING MORE OFFSPRING, ARE YOU GOING TO PASS THOSE GENES ON PREFERENTIALALLY TO THE NEXT GENERATION SO, THAT IS NATURAL SELECTION.
Stephen: IF YOU ACCEPT NATURAL SELECTION.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: BECAUSE IT IS THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION AND A ASSUME THAT THIS BOOK IS ON THE PRO THEORY SIDE.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: OKAY. A LOT OF BOOKS ARE AGAINST IT, THIS IS ONE-ON-ONE SIDE THERE ARE A LOT AGAINSTxD IT.
AT LEAST I'M ON THE SAME SIDE AS THE POPE SO IT'S OKAY. BUT ANYWAY-- .
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN ANY POINTS BY TALKING ABOUT THE POPE WITH ME, OKAY, THAT GUY IS ALSO PRO POOR, BUT GO AHEAD.
THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF EVOLUTION. IT'S CULTURAL EVOLUTION. SO OUR CULTURES�� CHANGE TOO. LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAD BEEN GIVING THERE SHOW IN THE 17th OR 18th CENTURY YOU WOULD BE WEARING A REALLY FANTASTIC WIG.
Stephen: I WOULD BE BURNED AS A WITCH BECAUSE TV DIDN'T EXIST BACK THEN.
EXACTLY AND SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON THAT POWDER AND THAT KIND OF STUFF. BUT WE GREW BEYOND THAT WE NO LONGER WEAR WIGS, OTHER THINGS IN OUR CULTURE CONSTANTLY CHANGED.
Stephen: GAY MARRIAGE.
GAY MARRIAGE, EXACTLY. ALL KINDS OF THINGS ARE CHANGE�� AND THOSE CHANGES AFFECT OUR BODIES, SOME OF THEM, GAY MARRIAGE OBVIOUSLY AFFECTS OUR BODIES.
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY. EVER SINCE GAY MARRIAGE IS LEGAL I KEEP GAINING WEIGHT.
IT'S LIKE SUGAR.
Stephen: IT IS. TRANSFAT WA, ABOUT OUR DIET, OUR DIET HAS CHANGED.
HE NOR LOSELY. INCREDIBLY SINCE INDUSTRIALIZATION, SO THE FIRST BIG SHIFT IN OUR DIET WAS REALLY AGRICULTURE REVOLUTION SO, WE STARTED GROWING FOOD.
Stephen: WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT, 1960s?
WELL, IT STARTED ABOUT 600 GENERATIONS AGO SO.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT, 1940s.
1940s, 10,000 YEARS BEFORE THAT.
Stephen: 10,000 YEARS AGO WE STARTED GROWING CORN.
WELL, YES, IN THE MIDDLE EAST YOU STARTED GROWING BARLEY AND WHEAT IN CHINA RICE AND IN THE NEAR EAST, IN MESSO AMERICA WE STARTED GROWING CORN BUT THAT IS ONLY 6-GENERATIONS AGO THAT IS THE NUMBER OF GENERATIONS OF MISE THAT HAVE LIVED IN MY BASEMENT IN THE LAST 100 YEARS.
Stephen: WOW, YOU GOT A PROBLEM.
ACTUALLY, WE DO. AND I'M CONSTANTLY OUT THERE WITH MY MOUSE TRAPS. BUT ANYWAY, BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT THATCH TIME. WE'VE HE VOLUME OFED SINCE THEN. THERE HAVE BEEN ADAPTATION, FOR EXAMPLE WHEN MY ANCESTORS AND MAYBE YOUR ANCESTORS ADAPTIONS TO DRINK MILK, SO THAT IS A NATURAL SELECTION. BUT-- .
Stephen: THEY GOT THAT HEAT VISION.
YES, WOULDN'T THAT BE COOL. BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF CHANGES THAT WE HAVE HAD THAT WHICH WE HAVEN'T ADAPTED FOR. AND SO WE GET WHAT WE CALL MISMATCH DISEASE, DISEASES IN WHICH OUR BODIES ARE INADEQUATELY ADAPTED TO THE MAD EARN WORLD AND SUGAR IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES. WE CANNOT HANDLE FOODS THAT HAVE A LOT OF SUGAR.
Stephen: BUT EVOLUTION ARILY, DON'T WE CRAVE SUGAR, ISN'T THAT THE REASON WHY IT TASTES SO GREAT TO US.
RIGHT.
Stephen: IS EVOLUTION KILLING US?
IN A WAY, IN A WAY IT'S BECAUSE OF EVOLUTION THAT WE CRAVE SUGAR BECAUSE SUGAR IS FULL OF ENERGY. AND IF YOU ARE A HUNTER GATHERERER YOU ARE BARELY SURVIVING IT IS GREAT TO WANT AS MUCH SUGAR AS YOU CAN, HUNTERS LOVE HONEY, THEY WILL EAT AS MUCH AS THEY CAN BUT THEY DON'T GET THAT MUCH. MOST OF THE FOOD IS A ABOUT AS SWEET AS A CARROT.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT TRANSFATS, DID THEY HAVE THAT.
THEY DON'T HAVE TRANSFATS AS YOU KNOW.
Stephen: I DID NOT KNOW, I WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED.
TRANSFATS WERE INVENTED VERY RECENTLY AND OUR BODIES CANNOT HANDLE THEM. JUST LYING SUGAR.
Stephen: THEY ARE ILLEGAL IN NEW YORK, LIKE NEW YORK CITY THEY CAN'T HAVE TRANSFATS.
GOOD FOR NEW YORK. IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
Stephen: ISN'T THAT ANTI-EVOLUTIONARY BECAUSE IF WE DON'T EAT THE TRANSFAT WE WON'T KNOW WHO CAN SURVIVE EATING TRANSFAT TO PASS THAT EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE ON TO OUR CHILDREN, THEN WE WOULD HAVE A SUPERRACE THAT CAN EAT TRANSFAT. FANNED WE CAN SURVIVE TRANSFATS, NOTHING CAN KILL US.
THE ONLY WAY THAT YOUR EXPERIMENT WILL WORK, IF YOU EVER GET APPROVAL FOR IT WHICH DOUBT, IS, IS IF EATING TRANSFATS AFFECTED YOUR ABILITY TO HAVE OFFSPRING BECAUSE ALL NATURAL SELECTION CARES ABOUT IS HOW MANY OFFSPRING. AND MOST OF THE DISEASE YOU GET FROM TRANSFATS DON'T HIT YOU UNTIL YOU ARE A GRANDPARENT.
Stephen: IF WE TOOK AWAY THE THINGS THAT WERE CAUTION ME TO BE SICK FROM BEING OLD HOW MUCH OLDER COULD I LIVE. BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE FOREVER.
WE HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT ONE OUT YET BUT MAYBE SCIENTISTS IN WHITE LAB COATS WILL DO THAT BUT I THINK THAT IS UNLIKELY.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIVE LONGER.
YEAH, PROBABLY.
Stephen: HOW LONG WOULD YOU LIKE TO LIVE.
I WOULD THINK 92. THAT'S PERFECT, YEAH.
Stephen: I WOULD LIKE THAT TOO. NOW I WANT TO LIVE 93, TO BEAT�r YOU. THANK YOU SOME OF FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
