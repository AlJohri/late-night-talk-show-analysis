STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SAYS THAT ABANDONING CAPITALISM IS THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE THE PLANET. I SAY LET THE FREE MARKET DECIDE WHICH ECONOMIC SYSTEM WE ABANDON. PLEASE WELCOME NAOMI KLEIN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
STEPHEN: NAOMI, THANKS FOR COMING BACK. BEEN A WHILE. NICE TO SEE YA. OK, YOUNG LADY, YOU'RE AN AWARD WINNING AUTHOR, BEST KNOWN FOR THE SHOCK DOCTRINE, AND YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING:   CAPITALISM VERSUS THE CLIMATE."
YEP. YOU CAN ATTACK ALOT OF THINGS, BUT NOW YOU'RE ATTACKING CAPITALISM. WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING CAPITALISM AND WHAT THE HELL DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH THE CLIMATE?
CAPITALISM IS ATTACKING US.
STEPHEN: CAPITALISM MADE THIS SHOW POSSIBLE! (LAUGHTER) CAPITALISM IS THE PROFIT, THE GREASE THAT TURNS THE WHEEL OF PROGRESS!
CAPITALISM HAS BEEN GOOD FOR --
STEPHEN: ME.
YOU.
STEPHEN: YEAH.
AND THIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY PEOPLE LIKE YOU DENY CLIMATE CHANGE.
STEPHEN: I DON'T DENY CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S HAPPENING, I JUST DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
EXACTLY, OKAY. SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT CAPITALISM IS A MACHINE BASED ON SHORT-TERM PROFIT AND GROWTH, AND THE CLIMATE NEEDS US TO CONTRACT. SO YOU HAVE THIS TENSION BETWEEN A SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO GROW, GROW, GROW INDISCRIMINATELY AND A PLANET GOING, GUYS, I'VE HAD IT, AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HAVING MORE STORMS AND DROUGHTS --
STEPHEN: ARE YOU A DRUID? ARE THE TREES TALKING TO YOU? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, THE PLANET IS TALKING? (LAUGHTER)
WE ARE OVERLOADING OUR PLANET'S LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM.
STEPHEN: I FLY OVER THE COUNTRY ALL THE TIME. IT'S GREEN OUT THERE, LAKES --
CALIFORNIA NOW IS IN DROUGHT.
STEPHEN: IT'S ALL CYCLICAL. RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING THROUGH A CYCLE THAT --
IT'S BREAKING RECORDS OVER AND OVER.
STEPHEN: WE'RE PEAKING. WE'RE PEAKING IN THE CYCLE. WERE YOU PART OF THE MARCH THAT HAPPENED, 400,000 PEOPLE IN NEW YORK ON CLIMATE CHANGE?
YES (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WHAT DID YOU GUYS HOPE TO DO WITH THAT THING?
WELL, HERE WE ARE, EVERY SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD IS TELLING US THAT THIS IS A CRISIS, THAT IF WE STAY ON THE ROAD WE'RE ON, THE REASON WHY I CALL THE "THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING" BOOK IS BECAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR PLANET IF WE STAY ON THE ROAD WE'RE ON. SO PEOPLE ON THE STREETS SUNDAY WERE EXPECTING THE SENSE OF URGENCY OUR POLITICAL AROUND CORPORATE LEADERS LACK AND TRYING TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE AT THE U.N. TODAY WHO ARE GATHERING TO SAY WE NEED ACTION IN LINE WITH THIS CRISIS.
STEPHEN: OKAY. SO WE BLOW UP CAPITALISM. LET'S SAY WE TEAR IT DOWN. WE STRIP CAPITALISM DOWN TO THE BARE BONES. IT'S THE YEAR ZERO, OUR EMPRESS IS NAOMI KLEIN. WHAT ECONOMIC SYSTEM DO WE PUT BACK IN PLACE TO REBUILD IN PLANET? WHAT'S THE FIRST BRICK OTHER THAN THE BOOK?
BEFORE WE DO AWAY WITH CAPITALISM, WE NEED TO GET THE PROFITS FROM THE CORPORATION --
STEPHEN: OH, HERE WE GO... NOT ENOUGH TO DESTROY THE SYSTEM, WE HAVE TO ATTACK THE RICH.
WE NEED THEIR MONEY.
STEPHEN: I'M A RICH GUY. THIS IS A PERSONAL ATTACK ON ME. ARE YOU A RICH PERSON?
NOT NEARLY AS RICH AS YOU.
STEPHEN: YOU ARE A SOMEWHAT RICH PERSON?
I AM A FORTUNATE PERSON, YES.
STEPHEN: HOW CAN YOU BETRAY YOUR CLASS?
I AM A PROUD CLASS TRAITOR.
STEPHEN: AND YOU'RE A DAMN CANADIAN. YOU NEVER LIVED UNDER A CAPITALIST SYSTEM, YOU'RE FROM CANADA!
WELL, BUT MY GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY KEEPING THE GEORGE W. BUSH DREAM ALIVE.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU.
WE HAVE A COMPLETE MERGER OF OIL AND STATE AND WE ARE DIGGING THE ALBERTA TARSANDS AS FAST AS WE CAN AND MY MAYOR SMOKES CRACK
STEPHEN: HE'S CLEANING UP UP THE STREETS ONE ROCK AT A TIME.
WE HAVE TO GET THEIR PROFITS STEPHEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE KNOWINGLY CREATED THIS CRISIS.
STEPHEN: AND BEEN SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMEN AND WE'RE PUNISHING SUCCESS NOW.
IT'S CALLED POLLUTER PAYS. OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE BROKE.
STEPHEN: POLLUTER PAYS?
WE NEED THEIR MONEY. HERE'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO, WE NEED TO TAKE A GOOD PORTION OF THE PROFITS FROM THE FOSSIL FUEL SECTOR, FROM SOME OF THE HIGHEST POLLUTING SECTORS AND EXPAND THE PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY THAT ARE ALREADY LOW CARBON LIKE HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION, THE ARTS -- YOU'RE AN ARTIST, STEPHEN.
STEPHEN: I AM NOT AN ARTIST. SHUT UP. YOU TAKE THAT BACK. YOU TAKE THAT BACK! I HAVE A JOB! I HAVE A STEADY JOB! I'M NOT AN ARTIST!
YOU'RE A JOB CREATOR.
STEPHEN: I DID NOT GO TO DARTMOUTH TO BE CALLED AN ARTIST! (LAUGHTER) WELL, NAOMI, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE BOOK, THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING, "THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING." I HAVEN'T FINISHED READING THE BOOK. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHO WINS, CAPITALISM OR THE CLIMATE, BUT I ASSUME IT'S CAPITALISM BECAUSE THE BOOK COST $30 AND IT'S PRINTED ON DEAD TREES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NAOMI, THANK YOU SO MUCH! "THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING"! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
