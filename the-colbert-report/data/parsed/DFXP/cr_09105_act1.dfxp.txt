Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: OH, I LOVE A ZOMBIE  ARMY. HAVE A SEAT. NATION, YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IF YOU  WATCH THE NEWS LIKE I DO, IT  SEEMS LIKE LATELY PRESIDENT OBAMA CANNOT SWING A DEAD CAT  WITHOUT HITTING SOME SORT OF  SCANDAL. WHICH REMINDS ME, WHAT'S HE  DOING WITH ALL THESE DEAD CATS? THE CHALLENGE IS, FOLKS, WHICH  ONE TO COVER. AS ALWAYS, I LOOK TO MY  JOURNALISTIC HEROES: CRONKITE,  MURROW, BARKER. SO TONIGHT, I AM PROUD TO  INTRODUCE FOR THE FIRST TIME ON  THE COLBERT REPORT THE OBAMA SCANDAL BOOTH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE OBAMA SCANDAL  BOOTH. BROUGHT TO YOU BY MAZDA AND THE  SCANDALOUSLY SLEEK REDESIGN OF  THE ALL NEW 2014 MAZDA SIX. MAZDA: IT'S NOT YOUR FATHER'S  OLDSMOBILE. BECAUSE IT'S A MAZDA. NOW INSIDE THIS BOOTH ARE SLIPS  OF PAPER, EACH WITH THE NAME OF  A WHITE HOUSE SCANDAL: I.R.S., A.P., BENGHAZI, IMMORTAL  SCORPION SOLDIERS. OH, IT'S COMING OUT. AND JUST MOMENTS FROM NOW,  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WILL  ENTER THE BOOTH AND, LIKE MY COLLEAGUES, GRASP WILDLY AT ANY  ACCUSATION THAT FLOATS PAST. TEN SECONDS... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JIMMY, TEN SECONDS ON THE CLOCK,  PLEASE. JIMMY. LET'S GET READY TO SCANDAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND TONIGHT'S SCANDAL IS  BENGHAZI. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YES, BENGHAZI. FOLLOWING THE TRAGIC ATTACKS OF  EIGHT MONTHS AGO, BENGHAZI AND  THE RUMORED COVER-UP HAS BECOME PROBLEM NUMBER ONE FOR THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION.
SOME REPUBLICANS SAY THE  BENGHAZI SCANDAL WILL CAUSE  PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DOWNFALL. A SURVEY FROM PUBLIC POLICY  POLLING SHOWS 41% OF REPUBLICANS  CONSIDER IT IS TO BE THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN  HISTORY.
Stephen: YES, BENGHAZI IS THE  BIGGEST SCANDAL SINCE SLICED  BREAD WAS CAUGHT FUNNELING MONEY TO NICARAGUAN DEATH SQUADS. FOLKS, IF REPUBLICANS ARE ANGRY  NOW, IMAGINE HOW THEY'LL FEEL  WHEN THEY LEARN WHERE BENGHAZI  IS.
OF THE REPUBLICANS 39% DON'T  KNOW WHERE BENGHAZI IS. 6% THINK IT'S IN CUBE I CAN'T... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: FOLKS, I SAY THIS  JUST PROVES THAT THE SCANDAL IS  GLOBAL FROM BENGHAZI, ARGENTINA, ALL THE WAY TO BENGHAZI, JAPAN. THIS COULD EVEN HURT OBAMA IN  HIS HOMETOWN OF BENGHAZI,  ILLINOIS. NOW, REPUBLICANS HAVE ACCUSED  THE WHITE HOUSE AND STATE  DEPARTMENT OF PARTISAN, POLITICAL WHITE WASHING OF THE  TALKING POINTS THAT AMBASSADOR  SUSAN RICE USED ON THE SUNDAY SHOWS AFTER THE ATTACK TO HELP  OBAMA'S RE-ELECTION. BUT WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN JAY  CARNEY REPEATEDLY DENIED THE  WHITE HOUSE OR STATE DEPARTMENT MADE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO THE  TALKING POINTS BUT ON MAY 10,  ABC NEWS SUPER SLEUTH JONATHAN KARL UNCOVERED AN EMAIL FROM THE  WHITE HOUSE'S DEPUTY NATIONAL  SECURITY ADVISOR BEN RHODES AND JOHN KARL QUOTED, QUOTE, WE MUST  MAKE SURE THAT THE TALKING  POINTS REFLECT ALL AGENCY EQUITIES INCLUDING THOSE OF THE  STATE DEPARTMENT. A WHITE HOUSE EMAIL IMPLICATING  THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND BOOM  GOES THE SCANDAL-MITE. YOU SEE WITH THIS EMAIL JAY  CARNEY IS A LIAR AND THESE FOLKS  ARE IN THIS SCANDAL UP TO THEIR  BALL-GHAZIS. END OF STORY. EXCEPT THE ACTUAL STORY.
WE OBTAINED AN ACTUAL COPY OF  THE BEN RHODES' EMAIL. AND HE DOESN'T MENTION THE STATE  DEPARTMENT. HE DOESN'T MENTION TALKING  POINTS.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE, SCOTT,  THE WHITE HOUSE ORCHESTRATED  THESE CHANGES.
THERE IS NO INDICATION IN ANY  OF THESE EMAILS OF ANY PARTISAN  DELETING, SCRUBBING OF THE  FACTS.
Stephen: SHUT UP, CHRIS. YOU'RE ON FOX NEWS, FOR GOD'S  SAKES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, WHAT PART OF "FAIR AND  BALANCEDDED" DO YOU UNDERSTAND? ANYWAY, SO WHAT. JONATHAN KARL DIDN'T NEED THE  ORIGINAL EMAIL. HE HAS A SIMPLE EXPLANATION. "THIS IS HOW I REPORTED THE  CONTENTS OF THAT EMAIL, QUOTING  VERBATIM A SOURCE WHO REVIEWED THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS AND  SHARED DETAILED NOTES."  YES, KARL NEVER SAW THE EMAIL SO WHEN HE QUOTED FROM IT, THOSE  QUOTES WERE IN QUOTES. I MEAN, THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU  CALL JOURNALISM. NOW I WAS SURPRISED... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I WAS SURPRISED THAT THIS PAST  SUNDAY JON KARL WASN'T ON "THIS  WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS" OR AT THE VERY LEAST "WALKING  BACK YOUR STATEMENTS WITH THE  STARS."  BUT NATION, TOMORROW NIGHT, I WILL HAVE AN EX-CLUES I'VE  INTERVIEW WITH JONATHAN KARL TO  DISCUSS THE BENGHAZI EMAILS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. THAT REALLY WASN'T NECESSARY. I JUST RECEIVED A CONFIRMATION  EMAIL FROM JONATHAN KARL HIMSELF  IN WHICH HE WRITES, QUOTE, I WOULD LOVE TO APPEAR ON THE  COLBERT REPORT. MY NAME IS JONATHAN KARL. P.S., MY LOWER BODY IS MOSTLY  RACOON.   ( APPLAUSE )   NOW, I AM AWARE THAT SOME  QUESTIONS HAVE ARISEN. IS THAT EMAIL REAL? YES. DID I WRITE IT MYSELF? PERHAPS. DID I PERSONALLY SIGN UP FOR THE  EMAIL ADDRESS "HOT KARL 4 YOU AT  G-MAIL DOT-COM? YES. BUT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH  THIS STORY. THE POINT IS, I QUOTED THAT  EMAIL VERBATIM. AND IF NEED BE, I WILL GET  CONFIRMATION. LET ME JUST MAKE A LITTLE CALL  HERE. IT'S CONFIRMED. ARE YOU SURE? YES. CONFIRMED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO BENGHAZI, DONE. WHAT'S NEXT? LET'S HEAD BACK OVER TO THE  MAZDA SCANDAL BOOTH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO THE MAZDA SCANDAL  BOOTH. MAZDA, IT'S WHAT'S FOR DINNER. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. JIMMY, LET'S SWIRL UP SOME  JOURNALISM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IRS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE,  WHICH REMINDS ME, IF ANYONE  ASKS, THAT BOOTH IS MY HOME  OFFICE. ALSO MY SON. FOLKS, THE I.R.S. HAS RECENTLY  ADMITTED SINGLING OUT  APPLICATIONS FOR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS FROM GROUPS WITH WORDS  LIKE TEA PARTY, PATRIOTS, 9-12,  OR SAID THEY WANTED TO MAKE AMERICA A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE. THESE FLAGGED GROUPS WERE WHICH  LED TO MASSIVE DPLAIS A PROCESS  WHICH FOX NEWS DESCRIBES AS SLOW WALKING WHICH ALSO DESCRIBES  THEIR VIEWERS.   ( APPLAUSE )   AND LAST WEEK, THE SCANDAL  CLAIMED ITS FIRST VICTIM.
NOW TO WASHINGTON WHERE THE  I.R.S. SCANDAL HAS CAUSED THE  MAN AT THE TOP TO LOSE HIS JOB. STEVE MILLER HAD BEEN ACTING  COMMISSIONER OF THE AGENCY FOR  JUST SIX MONTHS.
Stephen: YES, OBAMA DUMPED  ACTING I.R.S. COMMISSIONER STEVE  MILLER AND I SAY IT'S ABOUT  TIME. MY SOURCES TELL ME HE'S A JOKER,  A SMOKER AND A MIDNIGHT TOKER.   ( APPLAUSE )   AND OFTEN USES THE ALIAS  MAURICE. NOW, THE TAX EXEMPT GROUP  SINGLED OUT BY THE I.R.S. ARE  ALL SOCIAL WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS KNOWN AS 501(C)4s. WARNING: THE FOLLOWING FOOTAGE  CON TAPES GRAPHIC DEPICTIONS OF  THE U.S. TAX CODE.
THE C-4 DESIGNATION GREW IN  VALUE IN 2010 RIGHT AFTER THE  SUPREME COURT SAID CORPORATIONS COULD SPEND UNLIMITED CASH ON  ELECTIONS, C-4 APPLICATIONS MORE  THAN DOUBLED. C4s ARE SPECIFICALLY FORBIDDEN  TO MAKE POLITICS THEIR PRIMARY  ACTIVITY BUT ONE ADVANTAGE, THEY DON'T HAVE TO REVEAL THEIR  DONORS
Stephen: A C-4 IS LIKE A  SUPER PAC THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO  REVEAL ITS DONORS WHICH MEANS THEY COULD BE ANYONE FROM ONE OF  THE KOCH BROTHERS ALL THE WAY TO  THE OTHER KOCH BROTHER. AND IT IS ALL PERFECTLY LEGAL AS  LONG AS POLITICS ISN'T THE  GROUP'S PRIMARY ACTIVITY MEANING YOUR 501(C)4 CAN SPEND 49% OF  ITS EFFORTS PRODUCING ADS  CALLING BARACK OBAMA A SOCIALIST AS LONG AS IT SPENDS THE OTHER  51% DOING SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE  COMMUNITY LIKE EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN THAT BARACK OBAMA IS A  SOCIALIST.   ( APPLAUSE )   NOW, MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW I HAVE  MY OWN 501(C)4, COLBERT SUPER  PAC S-H-H OR SHHHH. AND FOLKS, I HOPE YOU'RE SITTING  DOWN BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER  RECEIVED I.R.S. APPROVAL FOR MY  C-4. (AUDIENCE GROANS)
Stephen: VERY GOOD. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS WHOLE  SCANDAL IS REALLY ABOUT ME? I'LL CHECK.
IT'S ABOUT YOU.  KNEW IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHEN WE RETURN, WE WILL GET TO  THE BOTTOM OF ME. WITH SUPER STARRY LECHES LAWYER  TREVOR POTTER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
