Stephen:  TONIGHT, HEALTH CARE FOR OUR ARMED FORCES. DOES OBAMA REMEMBER TO DO SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE ON OUR DRONES? ( LAUGHTER ) THEN ARE SOME QUESTIONS BETTER LEFT UNANSWERED? AND MY GUEST, THE HONORABLE RAY MABUS IS THE UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF NAVY. I WILL ASK HIM-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY SAYS THAT FAST FOOD WORKERS COULD SOON BE REPLACED BY ROBOTS. UNFORTUNATELY, EVEN ROBOTS CAN'T LIVE ON MINIMUM WAGE. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT."  Captioning sponsored by  COMEDY CENTRAL ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FOLKS-- FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YOU, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT AN AUDIENCE LOVES ME SO MUCH I CAN HEAR IT WITH MY DEAF EAR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NATION, I-- I GOTTA TELL YOU, FOLKS, I AM FURIOUS AT BARACK OBAMA. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I AM VICE-FURIOUS AT JOE BIDEN. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY, ANOTHER FEDERAL AGENCY REVEALS THEIR LACK OF LEADERSHIP. CASE IN POINT-- THE BUREAU OF ENGRAVING AND PRINTING HAS JUST PRODUCED A PORTRAIT OF CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS THAT IN NO WAY CAPTURES THE ELFIN TWINKLE IN HIS EYES. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS KIND OF WORK, AND I'M SUPPOSED TO SPEND THE MONEY THESE PEOPLE PRINT? NO THANKS. AND NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS IS LOUSY AT HELPING VETERANS OR THEIR AFFAIRS. ( LAUGHTER ).
STUNNING NEW REVELATIONS IN THE SCANDAL ROCKING THE VETERANS AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT.
A CNN INVESTIGATION FOUND 40 VETERANS DIED AT THE PHOENIX V.A. WHILE AWAITING TREATMENT.
THERE WAS A SECRET HIDDEN LIST, HIDING THE FACT THAT VETERANS WERE WAITING UP TO 21 MONTHS TO SEE A DOCTOR.
Stephen:  YES, A SECRET LIST TO SEE A DOCTOR-- THOUGH THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN TIPPED OFF BY THE BOUNCERS OUTSIDE THE O.R. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE ARE NOW SIMILAR CLAIMS IN 12 STATES, AND THE AMERICAN LEGION HAS CALLED FOR THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS, ERIC SHINSEKI, TO RESIGN. SO FAR HE HAS REFUSED, PROBABLY BECAUSE HE KNOWS ONCE HE RETIRES, HE'LL HAVE TO USE HEALTH CARE FROM THE V.A ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WORST OF ALL, FOR YEARS, THE PRESIDENT CLAIMED HE WOULD FIX THIS.
WHEN A VETERAN IS DENIED CARE, WE'RE ALL DISHONORED. THE SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN WHO EMBODY WHAT'S BEST ABOUT AMERICA SHOULD GET THE BEST CARE WE HAVE TO OFFER, AND THAT IS WHAT I WILL PROVIDE WHEN I AM PRESIDENT. LET'S KEEP TAKING CARE OF OUR EXTRAORDINARY MILITARY FAMILIES. THIS LEADS ME TO ANOTHER PROMISE I MADE FOUR YEARS AGO-- UPHOLDING AMERICA'S SACRED TRUST WITH OUR VETERANS. I PROMISE TO STRENGTHEN THE V.A., AND THAT PROMISE HAS BEEN KEPT.
Stephen:  YES, THAT PROMISE HAS BEEN KEPT, BUT HE'S EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN WHERE HE'S KEEPING IT. ( LAUGHTER ) MAYBE THEY SHOULD CHECK THE SHOE BOX IN THE BACK OF THE WHITE HOUSE CLOSET LABELED "TO DO." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, GET THIS, THE OBAMA PEOPLE NOW SAY THE PRESIDENT FIRST LEARNED OF THESE NEW  ALLEGATIONS FROM CNN. HE HAD NO CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON IN HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION. HERE'S AN IDEA-- GET THE N.S.A. TO START SPYING ON WOLF BLITZER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FAIR WARNING, GUYS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FAIR WARNING! FAIR WARNING, N.S.A.-- BRING SOME NO-DOZ. ( LAUGHTER ) THE ONLY OTHER WAY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION COULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS IS WHEN THE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TOLD THEM ABOUT IT.
THIS MEMO, PREPARED FOR PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA'S TRANSITION TEAM BY THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION, OUTLINED THE DIFFICULTIES VETERANS FACED IN OBTAINING TIMELY HEALTH CARE. IT URGED THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION TO PROPERLY DOCUMENT DESIRED APPOINTMENT DATES AND ENSURE PATIENT WAITING TIMES ARE ACCURATE. FAILURE TO DO SO, THE MEMO WARNED, WOULD AFFECT QUALITY OF CARE BY DELAYING AND POTENTIALLY DENYING DESERVING VETERANS TIMELY CARE.
Stephen:  THERE WAS A MEMO. IT WARNED THEM. BUSH EVEN PERSONALIZED IT-- P.S.:  V.A. TOTALLY EFF'D UP. SEE YA. WOULDN'T WANT TO BE YA. SMILEY FACE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FOLKS, THESE VETERANS ARE SUFFERING UNDER OBAMA'S WATCH, AFTER HE DECLARED THEM A TOP PRIORITY, AND HIS TEAM HAD BEEN ALERTED TO MISCONDUCT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? IT MEANS WE FINALLY HAVE A REAL SCANDAL. A REAL SCANDAL! JIMMY DROP THEM! WHOOO! WHOOO! WHOOO!  ♪  ♪ FOLKS, I HAVE WAITED SO LONG. ( LAUGHTER ) I KNOW I'VE CRIED WOLF BEFORE WHAT WITH BENGHAZI AND THE I.R.S. AND THE A.P., AND FAST AND FURIOUS, AND SOLYNDRA AND OBAMA'S UNCLE, AND OBAMA'S AUNT, AND OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE. I EVEN-- I EVEN CRIED WOLF ABOUT THE SECRET WHITE HOUSE WOLF. BUT THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT. IT'S BACKED UP BY EYEWITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS AND THE BETRAYAL OF SICK VETERANS. IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT'S WHY I CANNOT BELIEVE I AM GOING TO SAY THAT WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT THIS SCANDAL. YOU SEE, WE AMERICANS MADE A DEAL WITH THE VETERANS. WE START TWO WARS. THEY LAY THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE WHILE WE LAY ON OUR ASSES ON THE COUCH WATCHING "THE BACHELOR."   ( APPLAUSE ) I STILL HAVE FLASHBACKS WHENEVER I HEAR THE WORDS, "JUAN PABLO." IN RETURN WE SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AND THAT'S ABOUT IT. YES, TICKER TAPE PARADE WOULD HAVE BEEN BUT IN OUR PAPERLESS SOCIETY WE WOULD PROBABLY JUST THROW THE iPADS OUT THE WINDOW AND SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT. AND THAT'S NOT GOOD, BECAUSE I HEAR V.A. HEALTH CARE IS PRETTY BAD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IF WE TALK ABOUT THE V.A. SCANDAL, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT NEXT, THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN? I JUST FOUND OUT WE'VE GOT OVER 30,000 TROOPS STILL OVER THERE. COST ME 40 BUCKS AT MY BAR'S TRIVIA NIGHT. SO, VETERANS, AS MUCH AS THIS IS A REAL SCANDAL-- AND IT IS-- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. HERE TO MAKE ME TALK ABOUT IT IS THE FOUNDER OF THE IRAQ AND AFGHANISTANS VETERAN OF AMERICA, PAUL RIECKHOFF. PAUL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN, GREAT TO TALK TO YOU.
Stephen:  GOOD TO SEE YOU. PAUL, PAUL, DO WE REALLY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE V.A.?
YES, ABSOLUTELY, YES.
Stephen:  BUT HOW MUCH LONGER, HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE VETERANS? IT'S MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND. I'VE GOT A PICNIC TO GO TO.
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT FOR DECADES. THESE VETERANS ARE GOING TO BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY'RE AMAZING LEADERS AND THEY DESERVE THIS COUNTRY'S FULL CARE AND SUPPORT AND, UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN YOU'RE AT YOUR PICNIC OR AT THE BEACH, A LOT OF OUR VETERANS THIS WEEKEND WILL BE AT ARLINGTON PAYING THEIR RESPECTS TO THEIR FRIENDS THAT THEY LOST. IT'S ABOUT TIME THIS COUNTRY STEPPED UP AND REALLY SUPPORTED OUR VETERANS. YOU HAVE BEEN GREAT. I'VE GOT TO GIVE YOU CREDIT. THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS. YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD OUR BACKS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. BUT NOW IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO FOLLOW YOUR LEAD, STEPHEN.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, I WISH AMERICA WOULD BE MORE LIKE ME. THANK YOU, PAUL. HOW BIG OF A SCANDAL IS THIS ON A SCALE OF 1 TO BENGHAZI.
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW, IF BENGHAZI IS A POLITICAL HEADACHE, THIS IS GOING TO BE A STROKE. I MEAN, THIS IS IS NOT GOING AWAY. IT'S REALLY BAD. IT AFFECTS MILLIONS OF VETERANS WHO USE THE V.A. CARE. IT'S BEEN IN 10 CITIES ALREADY. WE THINK THERE MAY BE MORE. AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AT THE VETERANS AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT IS NOW INSPECTING 26 CITIES. SO OUR MEMBERS, HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND OF THEM NATIONWIDE ARE OUTRAGED. THEY'RE BETRAYED. AND THEY NEED REAL LEADERSHIP AND REFORM AND ACTION FROM  SHINSEKI AND THE PRESIDENT AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
Stephen:  THERE HAVE BEEN  SCANDALS AND MISMANAGEMENT AT THE V.A. SINCE I WAS A KID. WHY HAS THIS ONE BROKEN THROUGH?
I THINK THIS THE COUNTRY IS PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE 40 VETERANS MAY HAVE DIED WAITING AND THERE MAY HAVE BEEN  VETERANS WHO DIED WAITING IN OTHER CITIES. MAYBE IT'S A PERFECT STORM. MAYBE THE COUNTRY IS FINALLY FED UP HEARING STORY AFTER STORY FROM THE V.A. ABOUT HOW OUR VETERANS ARE BEING NEGLECTED AND DISAPPOINTED AND MAYBE WE CAN FINALLY BREAK THROUGH. IF THERE'S A SILVER LINING IT'S THE COUNTRY FINALLY WAKES UP AND UNDERSTANDS THAT OUR VETERANS ARE A TREMENDOUS RESOURCE. THEY DESERVE OUR SUPPORT AND OUR LOVE AND  THEY DESERVE A V.A. THAT WORKS. WE'RE NOT ASKING FAIR LOT HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT SAID-- THE PRESIDENT SAID HE DID NOT HEAR ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR SCANDAL UNTIL HE SAW IT ON CNN.
RIGHT.
Stephen:  CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING CNN? ( LAUGHTER )
WELL, YOU KNOW, WHAT? NOW CNN'S FINALLY GOT SOMETHING TO COVER OTHER THAN THE PLANE. AND THIS IS A REAL ISSUE. THEY'VE BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON IT. AND OTHER FOLKS IN THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON IT. AND THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY. EVEN IF THE HEADLINES FADE WE NEED EVERYBODY TO CONTINUE TO STEP UP, HOLD PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON ACCOUNTABLE AND SUPPORT OUR VETERANS EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR.
Stephen:  LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION THAT I WOULD ONLY ASK BECAUSE THIS IS VIA SATELLITE AND YOU'RE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. IS THE V.A. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THE REASON YOU'RE STILL WAITING FOR THAT HAIR TRANSPLANT?
NO, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, STEPHEN? THAT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT, STEPHEN, I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU SHAVED YOUR HEAD AGAIN. AND YOU CAN DO IT FOR CHARITY-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE COULD HOOK YOU UP. YOU LOOKED PRETTY GOOD. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HOOK YOU UP.
Stephen:  MAYBE NEXT TIME IF YOU'RE NOT HERE BY SATELLITE. PAUL RIECKHOFF, THE I.A.V.A. THANK YOU, PAUL.
