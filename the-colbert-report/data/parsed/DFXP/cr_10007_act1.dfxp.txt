Stephen: TONIGHT, DID A CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE VIOLATE ELECTION LAWS? EVEN MORE SHOCKING, WE HAVE ELECTION LAWS? (LAUGHTER) THEN, TWITTER PREPARES FOR ITS I.P.O. HASHTAG: I DON'T KNOW WHAT AN I.P.O. IS. (LAUGHTER) MY GUEST TOM HANKS STARS IN THE NEW FILM "CAPTAIN PHILLIPS." HE'S A HERO WHO SAVES THE DAY USING A PARTICULAR TYPE OF SCREWDRIVER. THE CONGRESSIONAL BUSINESS CENTER IS STILL OPEN DURING THE SHUTDOWN. WOW! IT IS REALLY HARD TO GET OUT OF A GYM MEMBERSHIP. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen: HEY! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") WHOO! WHOO! WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AS YOU KNOW IT IS DAY NINE OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS -- SO -- GOOD NEWS. (LAUGHTER) YESTERDAY OBAMA ACTUALLY HELD ANOTHER HOUR-LONG PRESS CONFERENCE TO SAY ONCE AGAIN HE WON'T NEGOTIATE. SO SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER HAD HIS OWN PRESS CONFERENCE.
THE CENTRAL ARGUMENT IS THIS: ARE WE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A CONVERSATION OR AREN'T WE? THERE'S NO REASON TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO BRING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE. THERE'S NO PWOUPB REIS HERE. THERE'S NOTHING ON THE TABLE, THERE'S NOTHING OFF THE TABLE.
Stephen: THAT IS A LEADER WITH A CLEAR GOAL! "I WANT A TABLE!" (LAUGHTER) BUT -- BUT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT WHILE THERE'S BEEN NO MOVEMENT IN D.C., THERE ISN'T MOVEMENT TOWARDS D.C.
ANGRY TRUCKERS HEADED TO WASHINGTON, D.C. AS PART OF A THREE-DAY PROTEST CALLED "THE TRUCKERS' RIDE FOR THE CONSTITUTION." IT'S EXPECTED TO TIE UP THREE LANES OF TRAFFIC AROUND I-495 AROUND THE NATION'S CAPITAL.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, TRUCKERS ARE PLEDGING TO DRIVE AROUND THE BELTWAY FOR THREE DAYS IN WHAT THEY'RE CALLED "RIDE FOR THE CONSTITUTION." AND THEN, PRESUMABLY, POP DEXEDRINE FOR THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. (LAUGHTER) AND PEE INTO GATORADE BOTTLES FOR THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW, FOLKS, I OF ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE I GET THESE GUYS BECAUSE THEY GET ME! IN FACT, THEY'VE GOT ME ON THEIR WEB SITE. (LAUGHTER) THEY'RE USING THIS ACTUAL PAINTING CALLED "STEPHEN COLBERT ATOP AN EAGLE" BY ARTIST JASON HEUSER. I BELIEVE IT'S PAINT BY NUMBER AND THAT NUMBER U.S.A. NUMBER ONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS? WELL, AS EXPLAINED BY RIDE FOR THE CONSTITUTION'S LEADER COUNTRY ZINGER ZEEDA ANDREWS, THEY HAVE A SIMPLE EASILY ATTAINED GOAL.
UM, WE -- WHAT WE WANT IS WE WANT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES REMOVED FROM OFFICE. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL BE SO IMMOBILIZED BY THE D.C. TRAFFIC JAM THAT HE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RESIGN. I MEAN, REALLY! WHAT OPTION DOES HE HAVE? FLY OVER IT IN SOME KIND OF GYROSCOPIC SKY-CAR? (LAUGHTER) MARK MY WORDS -- MARK MY WORDS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD. OR BETTER YET, MARK THE WORDS OF SPOKES TRUCKER PETER SANTILLI.
PUT A HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE OUT ON THE ROAD WITH TRUCK DRIVERS LAWFULLY, CONSTITUTIONALLY, THERE WILL BE LITERALLY THE LARGEST TRAFFIC JAM IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED. IT'S GOT THAT POTENTIAL.
YOU HEARD THEM SAY A HUNDRED MILLION. THEY'RE GOING TO START SMALLER. THEY'RE GOING TO START WITH 3,000 ARRIVING IN D.C. ON FRIDAY MORNING.
Stephen: YEAH, 3,000 FRIDAY MORNING. BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON A HUNDRED MILLION. (LAUGHTER) YOU'VE GOT TO RAMP UP. FOLKS, LET ME GET OUT MY OLD C.B. RADIO AND PUT MY EARS ON. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT, BREAKER BREAKER 1-9, THIS IS BIG DADDY TRUCK NUTS HERE COME ON BACK. I WANT EVERY FREIGHT SHAKER, COAL BUCKET AND WIGGLE WAGON THROUGHOUT TO ROLL ON BULL CITY FRIDAY FOR A THREE-LANE BRAKE CHECK UNTIL WE DELIVER A TRUCKLOAD OF KENYA BACK TO HIS HOME 1020. ALSO DING-DONG ON THE FLIPPITY FLOP DROP TWO OVER EASY AND PUT SOME SEA COVERS ON TOAD THE WET SPROCKET. THIS IS BIG DADDY TRUCK NUTS OVER AND OUT, COME ON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, I SALUTE THESE TRUCKERS FOR TAKING THE EXTRA STEP TO MAKE CONGRESSIONAL GRIDLOCK INTO ACTUAL GRIDLOCK. (LAUGHTER) AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ALL FOLLOW IN THEIR MUD FLAPS. JUST AS THEY ARE, DO WHAT YOU DO BUT DO IN THE A WAY THAT INCONVENIENCES THOUSANDS OF OTHERS. (LAUGHTER) AND TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE THINGS (BLEEP) FOR FREEDOM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE FAN OF THE TWITTER. FROM ITS HUMBLE BEGINNINGS AS A PLACE TO PROMOTE ASHTON KUTCHER'S TRUCKER HAT TO ITS CURRENT GLOBAL STATURE AS A PLACE TO PROMOTE ASHTON KUTCHER'S FACIAL HAIR. I EVEN RECEIVED THE FIRST-EVER GOLDEN TWEET FROM TWITTER FOUNDER BIZ STONE FOR THE MOST RETWEETED TWEET OF 2010. IN YOUR FACE! IN YOUR FACE DALAI LAMA! WHAT WAS YOUR BEST TWEET FROM 2010? "IN HUMAN RELATIONS, COMPASSION CONTRIBUTES TO PROMOTING PEACE AND HARMONY." HASHTAG LOSER. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT THE LATEST TWITTER NEWS.
TWITTER CAUSING THE WHOLE WORLD TOLL GO ATWITTER. WALL STREET ABUZZ, THE TECH WORLD ABUZZ ABOUT ITS ONE BILLION DOLLAR I.P.O. PLAN.
THE MOST ANTICIPATED I.P.O. OF THE YEAR.
THE I.P.O. IS EXPECTED TO BE THE MOST DESIRABLE SINCE FACEBOOK'S DEBUT LAST MAY.
Stephen: YES! AND I MADE $2 MILLION ON FACEBOOK BY NOT INVESTING $3 MILLION IN FACEBOOK. (LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, THIS I.P.O. IS GOING TO BE HUGE. AS ONE OF THE WORLD'S TOP TWEETMEN, I AM SURE TO RAKE IN THE CASH BECAUSE I HAVE OVER FIVE MILLION FOLLOWERS, SEVERAL OF WHICH ARE NOT UKRAINIAN PORN BOTS. (LAUGHTER) SO IF YOU JUST TAKE THOSE FIVE MILLION FOLLOWERS THAT I'VE GOT, OKAY, AND YOU DIVIDE THAT BY A BILLION DOLLAR I.P.O., THEN MULTIPLY THAT BY THE AMOUNT OF I GET PAID PER TWEET, I AM SET TO LINE MY POCKETS WITH -- (WHISTLES) LET'S JUST SAY IT'S A LOT OF SERE ROES. (LAUGHTER) SO, FOLKS, IT'S NO WONDER ALL THE SMART MONEY ON WALL STREET IS ON TWITTER BECAUSE SO IS THE DUMB MONEY.
LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE IS CASHING IN ON TWITTER'S I.P.O. -- EVEN OTHER COMPANIES. STOCK IN ELECTRONICS RETAILER TWEETER SOARED MORE THAN 1,500% ON FRIDAY. APPARENTLY SOME INVESTORS BOUGHT THE SHARES OF THAT COMPANY THINKING THEY WERE BUYING TWITTER. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: MEANING THE INVESTORS IN TWEETER FLUSHED ALL THEIR MONEY DOWN THE SHEETER. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) NOW, FOLKS, ALL THIS HEAT ON TWITTER IS BECAUSE IT'S WHERE ALL THE HIPPEST, HAPPENINGEST TRENDSETTERS GO TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS. I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT JESUS CHRIST. (LAUGHTER) YOU SEE, IN AN ATTEMPT TO APPEAL TO THE YOUNG LINGS VATICAN CARDINAL AND PRESIDENT OF THE PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR CULTURE GIANFRANCO RAVASI SAID "CHRIST USED TWEETSES WITH EVERYONE ELSE WITH PHRASES MADE UP OF 45 CHARACTERS SUCH AS LOVE ONE ANOTHER." OF COURSE JESUS TWEETED LUV 1ANTHR #YOLF #OMM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU SEE? YOU YOUNG PEOPLE -- YOUNG FOLKS, GIOVANNI RIBISI HERE IS JUST SAYING THAT JESUS IS INTO THE SAME COOL THINGS YOU ARE. HE INVENTED TWITTER BECAUSE HE SPOKE IN SHORT SENTENCES JUST LIKE EVE WAS THE FIRST TO PLAY FRUIT NINJA. (LAUGHTER) BUT REMEMBER, JESUS NEVER MADE ANY MONEY SO HE AND TWITTER HAVE THE EXACT SAME BUSINESS MODEL. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
