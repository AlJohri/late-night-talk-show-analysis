Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. THANKS, EVERYBODY. [CROWD CHEERING]  THANKS FOR BEING HERE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENERGY THANK YOU IN HERE OUT THERE ALL AROUND THE WORLD, MR. AND MRS. AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA I WANT TO THANK YOU FOLKS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOLKS FOR JOINING US ON THIS, ON THIS WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE LAST DAY OF AMERICA. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS IT, NATION. NO, NO, THIS IS IT, DATE WE ALL FEARED WOULD COME, EVER SINCE WE WERE TOLD IT WOULD COME SEVERAL MONTHS AGO HAS COME AT LAST. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE TONIGHT AT 8:00 PM MEXICAN STANDARD TIME. GENERALISSIMO OBAMA ANNOUNCED HIS UNILATERAL PLAN TO ALLOW FOUR MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO REMAIN IN AMERICA WITHOUT FEAR OF DEPORTATION. IT TURNS OUT THIS WHOLE TIME WE'VE BEEN BUILDING THAT WALL TO KEEP THEM IN.  [LAUGHTER]  [APPLAUSE]  SUBMITTED FOR YOUR APPROVAL.  [LAUGHTER]  I DO NOT SMOKE. [LAUGHTER]  I DO NOT SMOKE. [LAUGHTER] BUT FOLKS, THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH IS AT 8:00 TONIGHT. WE ARE TAPING OUR SHOW AT 7:30, SO I DON'T KNOW ONE WORD OF WHAT HE'S GOING TO SAY. BUT I DO KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DESCRIBE IT.
IT'S NOT AN EXECUTIVE ORDER, IT'S EXECUTIVE AMNESTY.
THE PRESIDENT WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH EXECUTIVE AMNESTY.
EXECUTIVE AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY.
EXECUTIVE AMNESTY.
EXECUTIVE AMNESTY.
Stephen:  OH REGULAR AMNESTY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR BARACK'S AMIGOS, HIS MUCHACHOS, HIS COMPADRES, NO!  HE HAD TO GIVE THEM EXECUTIVE AMNESTY. THEY GET THEIR OWN  WASH ROOM, FREE WIFI AND HOT TOWELS. FOLKS,  MY GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER DID NOT COME HERE FROM IRELAND TO SEE THIS COUNTRY  OVERRUN BY IMMIGRANTS. HE CAME HERE BECAUSE HE KILLED A GUY. I MEAN WHAT HAPPENED TO CHECKS AND BALANCES SIR. THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. EXECUTIVE, JUDICIAL AND  SPITEFUL INERTIA. BUT APPARENTLY OBAMA HAS JUST GIVEN HIMSELF A PROMOTION
THE EMPEROR IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES IS  GOING TO DECLARE WAR ON THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.
Stephen: ALL HAIL BARACKUS MAXIMUS. WE SHOULD'VE KNOWN HE'S GONE MAD WITH POWER. AFTER ALL, HE APPOINTED HIS HORSE SECRETARY OF STATE THIS LAWLESS OVERREACH MAKES ME FEAR FOR MY NATION. I JUST HOPE CALMER HEADS AND VOICES OF REASON PREVAIL. OR IF NOT, MAYBE TOM COBURN.
THE COUNTRY'S GOING TO GO NUTS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO SEE IT AS A MOVE OUTSIDE OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE PRESIDENT. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HOPEFULLY NOT, BUT YOU CAN SEE INSTANCES OF ANARCHY. YOU COULD SEE VIOLENCE
Stephen:  HE'S RIGHT. IF OBAMA DOES NOT DEPORT THE  PEOPLE ALREADY HERE I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW VIOLENT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE WHEN THEY WAKE UP TO SEE HOW SAME THINGS ARE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE WILL HAVE MORE ON    THIS STORY TWO DAYS AGO WHEN I TALKED ABOUT IT FOR  LIKE 12 MINUTES. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH. IT'S THE HOLIDAYS FOR PETE'S SAKE. NATION, I'M ABOUT TO SCARE YOU HALF TO DEATH. SO WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T WATCH THIS TWICE.  THIS IS THE THREATDOWN. FIRST UP LONG TIME VIEWERS OF THE REPORT KNOW THAT I AM A PERSON. THAT'S WHY MY FAVORITE MAGAZINE IS PEOPLE AND EACH  YEAR IT SHOULDERS THE MONUMENTAL BURDEN OF  DETERMINING THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE. IT'S A DELICATE FORMULA THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT JAWLINE RUGGEDNESS, AB PACK QUANTITY,  MINIMUM OF 6 - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, ALIVENESS THIS YEAR THE REPUTATION HAS THE PREEMINENT SUPERMARKET IMPULSE BUY.
PEOPLE MAGAZINE HAS NAMED ITS SEXIEST MAN ALIVE FOR 2014 AND THE HONOR GOES TO AUSTRALIAN ACTOR CHRIS HEMSWORTH. HE WAS KNOWN TO MOVIE FANS AS THE HAMMER WIELDING SUPERHERO  THOR
Stephen:  CHRIS HEMSWORTH. HOW IS HE THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE. HE'S NOT EVEN THE SEXIEST HEMSWORTH ALIVE. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER THREE, AMERICA'S DECLINING STANDARDS OF SEXINESS. THIS HAS TO BE SAID. FIRST OF ALL AN AUSTRALIAN. THERE'S NOTHING SEXY ABOUT THE AUSSIES. YOU CAN'T SEE THEIR ABS BECAUSE OF THE POUCH THEY HAVE IN FRONT. THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE TITLE GOINGS TO CHRIS HEMSWORTH, IT'S ABOUT IT NOT GOING TO MATHEW MCCONAUGHEY. FOLKS, THE LAST TIME I CHECKED, HE'S STILL ALIVE AND AS GOD IS MY WITNESS, HE IS A MAN. AND YET SOMEHOW HE HASN'T BEEN THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE SINCE 2009. IT'S BEEN NINE YEARS OF BUTTER FACES. PLUS SEXINESS HISTORIANS WILL SOME DAY MARK THIS EPOCH AS THE MCCONAUGHEY-SSAINCE. IMAGINE IF DURING THE RENNAISANCE PEOPLE MAGAZINE  HADN'T PUBLISHED THIS COVER. HEY, CROSSBOW TO MY HEAD, SURE. THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING PEOPLE MAGAZINE. YOU HANG IN THERE BIG MAC. I KNOW THINGS LOOK ROUGH NOW BUT JUST KEEP LIVING AND YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NEXT UP, I CONSIDER MYSELF A REAL CHOCOHOLIC. FOR ME HERSHEY KISSES ARE NOT ENOUGH. I WANT FULL HERSHEY PENETRATION. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S IN THE FORM OF SYRUP, BAR, TACO OR WHATEVER EXTRUDED POLYMER  TOOTSIE IS. IF IT'S CHOCOLATE, IT GOES IN THE MOUTH TOOTSIE IS. IF IT'S CHOCOLATE, IT GOES IN THE MOUTH
PEOPLE ARE EATING CHOCOLATE FASTER THAN COCOA FARMERS CAN GROW THEIR CROPS. WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF CHOCOLATE IN FIVE YEARS. IT'S GOING TO BE A CHOCOLATE SHORTAGE. WE'RE NOT MAKING ENOUGH OF IT FOR AS MUCH AS WE'RE EATING.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT. THE WORLD IS RUNNING OUT OF CHOCOLATE WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN TODAY'S KATHY CARTOON.  FOLKS. DON'T DO IT, KATHY DON'T DO IT, SISTER. THIS COCOA CATASTROPHE BRINGS ME  TO NUMBER TWO. PEOPLE WHO EAT CHOCOLATE WHO AREN'T ME THIS SHORTAGE IS LARGELY DUE TO THE RISING POPULARITY OF DARK CHOCOLATE WHICH CONTAINS MORE COCOA THAN TRADITIONAL CHOCOLATE BARS. OH YES, DARK CHOCOLATE. IT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE MILK CHOCOLATE BUT WISHED IT TASTED LESS GOOD. CREAMY, SWEET AND DELICIOUS? I'LL PASS, THANKS BRING ON THE BITTER. SOON WE MAY RUN OUT OF CHOCOLATE COMPLETELY. IT WOULD BE THE COCOAGEDDON. HERALDED BY THE 3 MUSKATEERS OF THE APOCALYPSE. ALL THAT WOULD BE LEFT OF OUR CANDY BARS IS CARAMEL, NOUGAT, PEANUTS AND CRSIPY WAFERS.  UGH  I WOULD RATHER EAT FRUIT FINALLY FOLKS I ALWAYS LOVED STUDYING AMERICAN HISTORY FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON CHOPPING DOWN THE CHERRY TREE TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN CHOPPING DOWN THOSE VAMPIRES. OVER THE PAST WEEKEND I HEARD A FRIGHTENING CLAIM FROM TURKISH PRESIDENT AND ELVISH GREETING RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN. AND WHAT THIS MAN SAID COULD REWRITE AMERICAN HISTORY FASTER THAN A TEXAS SCHOOL BOARD.
THE AMERICAN CONTINENT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BY COLUMBUS IN 1492. HOWEVER 314 YEARS BEFOR COLUMBUS IN 1178 MUSLIM SAILORS REACHED THE AMERICAN CONTINENT.  THAT WAS IN 1178.
Stephen:  WHAT? MUSLIMS DISCOVERED AMERICA? THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. 1178 DOESN'T EVEN RHYME WITH SAIL THE OCEAN BLUE. BUT FOLKS, AS DISTURBING AS IT IS, IT MAY BE TRUE BECAUSE THE TURKISH PRESIDENT IS CITING A CHINESE DOCUMENT FROM 1178 CLAIMING MUSLIM SAILORS REACHED CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS A PASSAGE FROM COLUMBUS' JOURNAL IN WHICH HE MENTIONS THE EXISTENCE OF A MOSQUE ON A HILL ON THE CUBAN COAST, WHICH IS ALL THE PROOF I NEED. BECAUSE THE MAN WHO SET OUT FOR CHINA, ONLY THE LAND IN THE BAHAMAS AND DECLARES THE NATIVE PEOPLE INDIANS, NEVER GOT ANYTHING WRONG. AND THIS TURKISH -- [CROWD CHEERING] AND THIS TURKISH LACK OF DELIGHT BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER ONE. MUSLIM INVADERS OF THE NEW WORLD. FOLKS THESE REVELATIONS MEAN NOT ONLY ARE FOREIGNERS SNEAKING OVER OUR BORDERS THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR SIX CENTURIES LONGER THAN WE'VE HAD BORDERS. THANKS A LOT 12TH CENTURY OBAMA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS REVELATION, THIS REVELATION CALLS INTO QUESTION EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT EARLY AMERICAN HISTORY. WHAT'S NEXT, ARE PEOPLE GOING TO SAY COLUMBUS DIDN'T FIGHT THE PILGRIMS AT THE BATTLE OF MIAMI. IT SADDENS ME SOME PEOPLE WANT TO CHANGE THE BEAUTIFUL STORY OF AMERICA'S DISCOVERY. CHRISTIANS I WAS TAUGHT. LANDED ON THESE PRISTINE SHORES AND WERE WELCOME BY THE NATIVE PEOPLE. AND THEN WE SPENT THE NEXT FIVE  CENTURIES CARRYING OUT A BRUTAL CAMPAIGN -- DO YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S SAY THE MUSLIMS WERE HERE FIRST.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
