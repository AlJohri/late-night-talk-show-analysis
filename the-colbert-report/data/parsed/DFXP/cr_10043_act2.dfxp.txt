Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE NEWS YOU KNOW THAT AMERICA IS STILL IN THE GRIPS OF THE POLAR VORTEX. JACK FROST ISN'T JUST NIPPING AT OUR NOSE, HE'S SNAPPING AT OUR GENITALS LIKE A KIT KAT. GIVE ME A BREAK. BUT DON'T TAKE MY WORD THAT IT'S COLD OUT THERE. TAKE THE TV's.
AND HOW COLD IS IT? EVEN THE POLAR BEAR, THAT IS RIGHT, HAD TO SPEND THE NIGHT INSIDE.
HOW COLD IS IT, CHECK IT OUT. SO COLD IN MICHIGAN THE DETROIT RIVER HAS FROZEN.
HOW COLD IS IT? IT'S SO COLD IN LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY, THAT A PRISONER WHO ESCAPED FROM A MINIMUM SECURITY LOCKUP ON SUNDAY TURNED HIMSELF BACK IN ON MONDAY NIGHT WHEN IT WAS 20 BELOW ZERO.
JUST HOW COLD IS IT.
HOW COLD IS IT OUT THERE.
HOW COLD IS IT, JOHN SCOTT. WE'LL TELL YOU, ACROSS THE COUNTRY COMING UP. STAY WITH US.
Stephen: HOW COLD IS IT, IT IS SO COLD YOU FILL IN THE BLANK.
Stephen: OKAY BE.
OKAY, GET CREATIVE BUT DO NOT USE A WITCH'S ANATOMY, AS SOME PEOPLE ALREADY ARE.
Stephen: HEY, NO PROB, I GET IT, I GOT IT, KEEP IT CLEAN, KEEP IT CLEAN, HERE WE GO. @FOXNEWS... IT IS COLDER THAN A WARLOCK'S TAINT, OKAY. AND SEND. THERE YOU GO. OKAY. BUT CABLE NEWS KNOWS THAT AMERICANS CAN'T COMPREHEND THAT IT'S COLD OUTSIDE FROM ABSTRACT CONCEPTS LIKE TEMPERATURES AND "SEASONS". THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T JUST TELL, THEY SHOW. USING THE LATEST METEOROLOGICAL TECHNOLOGY RIPPED STRAIGHT FROM YOUTUBE, THE DOPPLER CUP OF WATER 9000.
IT'S SO COLD IF YOU TAKE BOILING WATER AND THROW IT INTO THE SKY T TURNS INTO SNOW JUST LIKE THIS.
WHEN YOU GET THIS BOILING HOT WATER AND THROW IT UP IN THE AIR-- YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF IT JUST TURNS RIGHT INTO SNOW.
THREE, TWO, ONE.
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT,.
THIS IS THE MOST DRAMATIC SCIENCE EXPERIMENT IN NEWS. (APPLAUSE) SINCE THEY BROUGHT BRIT HUME BACK TO LIFE WITH A BOLT OF LIGHTNING. (LAUGHTER) OKAY, OKAY, LET ME GET THIS CONCEPT. WATER TURNS INTO ICE BUT I JUST DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT FEELS LIKE OUTSIDE. ANYBODY ELSE?
YOU KNOW I LOVE MY COLD WEATHER EXPERIMENTS. I BROUGHT A PIECE OF WOOD WITH A NAIL IN IT. AND NOW MY MITTEN'S STUCK. AND THEN-- I BROUGHT A BANANA, A FROZEN BANANA, THAT I'VE LEFT OUTSIDE. JUST TO SHOW, SEE-- YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAMMER A NAIL WITH THE BANANA.
Stephen: OH, IT'S COLD, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE. NOW I UNDERSTAND. BY THE WAY, SHE'S HAMMERING THE BANANA, OKAY. BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARE'S GOING TO HAMMER THE BANANA MAKE SURE YOU'RE ALONE BECAUSE MY COLLEGE ROOMMATE WALKED IN ON ME ONCE AND IT WAS VERY EMBARRASSING. FOLKS, LIKE FRYING AN EGG ON THE SIDEWALK IN THE SUMMER, HAMMERING WITH A BANANA IS BUT ONE OF THE MANY FOOD-BASED TECHNIQUES THAT REPORTERS HAVE AT THE READY TO DEMONSTRATE WEATHER CONDITIONS TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT OF DOORS. (LAUGHTER) NOW NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW THIS BUT BACK WHEN I ANCHORED THE CHANNEL 7 NEWS AT NOON AT WPTS PATTERSON SPRINGS, NORTH CAROLINA, I WAS ALSO THE SECOND ALTERNATE WEEKEND WEATHER GUY UNDERSTUDY AND I STILL HAVE MY METEOROLOGICAL DEMONSTRATION FRUIT KIT, OKAY SO IF THERE ARE ANY CUB WEATHER REPORTERS OUT THERE LOOKING TO LEARN FROM A MASTER, PAY ATTENTION. HERE IS HOW IT WORKS. IF YOU WANT TO SHOW THE AUDIENCE THAT IT IS BRISK, BUT STILL ABOVE FREEZING, USE A NAVAL ORANGE TO ASSEMBLE A SWING SET. ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU NEED TO SHOW THAT IT'S IN THE 50s WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN, CHANGE A CAR TIRE WITH A BARTLETT PEAR, OKAY. BUT IF IT'S OVER 60 DEGREES AND CLOUDY THERE IS NO WAY TO SAY THAT EXCEPT BY BEATING A RACCOON TO DEATH WITH A PINEAPPLE. ALL RIGHT? LIKE THAT. DOW LIKE THAT? A LITTLE ROUGH STUFF. LITTLE ROUGH STUFF. ANY TEMPERATURE HIGHER THAN THAT, FRUIT WON'T WORK. YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE DELI MEATS, ALL RIGHT. AN AUDIENCE CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S 95 DEGREES IF YOU BUFF OUT A SCRATCHED QUARTER PANEL WITH A HONEY BAKED HAM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
