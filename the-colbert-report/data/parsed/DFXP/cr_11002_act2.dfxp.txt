STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. FOLKS, I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY SURPRISE. I'M NOT GOING TO BREAK ANY NEWS HERE WHEN I SAY I CONSIDER MYSELF A POSITIVE GUY. BUT NOW A RECENT STUDY HAS MADE ME SAD ABOUT BEING SO HAPPY, BECAUSE RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT PEOPLE WITH PESSIMISTIC VIEWS OF THE FUTURE WERE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE  LONGER AND HEALTHIER LIVES THAN THOSE WITH A ROSIER OUTLOOK. THAT'S RIGHT, NEGATIVE NELLIES LIVE LONGER -- A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS THE MCCAIN EFFECT. THE REASON, RESEARCHERS SAY, IS THAT THOSE WHO ARE DEFENSIVELY PESSIMISTIC MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO INVEST IN PREPARATORY OR PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES. FOR INSTANCE, A MAN WHO ALWAYS INSISTS ON WEARING PROTECTION IS LESS LIKELY TO GET A GIRL PREGNANT. JUST LIKE A MAN WHO ALWAYS INSISTS ON WEARING A PARACHUTE IS ALSO LESS LIKELY TO GET A GIRL PREGNANT. (LAUGHTER) THE SAME REPORT HAD BAD NEWS FOR HAPPY PEOPLE. DR. DILIP JESTE EXPLAINS.
EXCESSIVE OR OVER-CONFIDENCE CAN CREATE PROBLEMS. IT MAY PRODUCE FEELINGS OF INVINCIBILITY, AND THAT COULD RESULT IN UNNECESSARY RISK-TAKING. FOR EXAMPLE, TEENAGERS OR YOUNGSTERS MAY START DRINKING, SMOKING, USING SUBSTANCES.
STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT, OPTIMISM COULD LEAD TEENAGERS TO DRINK, SMOKE OR USE DRUGS. WHEREAS PESSIMISM COULD CAUSE THEM TO ALSO DO THAT. (LAUGHTER) AND IT'S NOT JUST TEENS -- RESEARCHERS REPORTED THAT SUBJECTS WHO WERE IDENTIFIED AS MOST OPTIMISTIC AS CHILDREN WERE THE ONES WHO DIED THE SOONEST. OKAY. THAT FINDING REALLY MAKES ME DEPRESSED. (LAUGHTER) THOUGH PROBABLY NOT AS DEPRESSED AS THE SCIENTIST WHOSE JOB IT WAS TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF HAPPY CHILDREN WHO DIED. (LAUGHTER) HANG IN THERE, BUDDY. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT UNIVERSITY OF ERLANGEN-NURNBERG USING DATA FROM A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY IN GERMANY. YES, GERMANY. LAND OF NIETZSCHE, GOETHE AND SAUERKRAUT, THE CONDIMENT THAT TASTES THE MOST LIKE HUMAN TEARS. (LAUGHTER) LUCKY FOR ME, I HAPPEN TO KNOW ONE OF THE GERMANS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS STUDY. PLEASE WELL COME FRIEND OF THE SHOW AND GERMANY'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N., THE HONORABLE HANS BEINHOLTZ. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PLEASE, SIT DOWN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AMBASSADOR.
HANS:  GLAD TO BE HERE. I HAD FEARED OUR NEXT MEETING WOULD BE AT MY FUNERAL. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: COME ON, HANS, YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF GREAT YEARS AHEAD OF YOU.
HANS:  TIME IS A CRUEL INVENTION TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF GROWTH. IN TRUTH, THE MOMENT WE ARE BORN IS THE MOMENT WE BEGIN TO DIE.
STEPHEN: DON'T FOCUS ON THE NEGATIVES. LIFE'S TOO SHORT.
HANS:  NOT SHORT ENOUGH. LIFE IS A NOOSE WITH KILOMETERS OF SLACK, TEASING US WITH THE PROMISE OF RELEASE. AND YET HERE I REMAIN, DOOMED TO GREET ANOTHER SUNRISE, ALONE EVEN IN COMPANY, THE OLD MAN ON THE TOWN BENCH WHOSE ONLY TRUE FRIENDS ARE THE DUCKS HE FEEDS, THOUGH SOON, THEY, TOO, WILL BE DEAD.
STEPHEN: WELL YEAH, BUT YOU WILL BE ALIVE, HANS. ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH, YOUR BLEAK WORLD VIEW IS GOING TO KEEP YOU GOING FOR A LONG TIME.
HANS:  REALLY?
STEPHEN: YEAH. HANS:  THAT'S WONDERFUL! I AM GOING TO LIVE! YIPPEE! AAGGHH, MEIN HEART...
STEPHEN: HANS, ARE YOU OKAY? YOU LOOK AWFUL!
HANS:  YOU REALLY THINK I LOOK AWFUL? DON'T SAY THAT JUST TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
STEPHEN: NO, SERIOUSLY, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE AT DEATH'S DOOR.
HANS:  THANK YOU, STEPHEN. I AM SAVED. IT IS MY FATE TO ONCE MORE RIDE THIS COLD ROCK AROUND THE SUN, ONLY TO WIND UP EXACTLY WHERE I STARTED -- ALONE.
STEPHEN: THAT'S THE SPIRIT, BUDDY. THE HONORABLE HANS BEINHOLZ, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
