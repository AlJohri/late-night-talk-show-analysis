WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, YOU KNOW THIS SHOW THAT YOU'RE WATCHING RIGHT NOW, IT'S PAID FOR, THIS SHOW IS PAID FOR BY THOSE ADS THAT YOU JUST WATCHED. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE NOBODY WATCHES ADS ANY MORE EXCEPT PEOPLE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER FLO LIVES IN HEAVEN, THE SOUTH POLE OR SOME KIND OF INSURANCE-INDUCED COMA. THAT'S WHY THESE DAYS COMPANIES OFTEN PAY TO WORK THEIR PRODUCTS RIGHT INTO THE SHOW ITSELF. IT'S CALLED PRODUCT PLACEMENT. AND NOW A NEW COMPANY CALLED MIRRIAD IS PROMISING TO TAKE PRODUCT PLACEMENT TO THE NEXT LEVEL AS ROGER FAXON, MIRRIAD'S CHAIRMAN AND MAN WHOSE NAME SOUNDS MORE CORPORATE THAN HIS COMPANES EXPLAINED ON THE FOX BUSINESS.
WHAT MIRRIAD HAS DONE IS TO FIND A WAY TO BRING BRANDS AND GREAT CONTENT TOGETHER, BY CREATING A LOGICAL AND SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF BRANDS INTO GREAT CONTENT. ADVERTISING IS THE CRITICAL INGREDIENT IN BRINGING GREAT CONTENT TO CONSUMERS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, ADVERTISING IS THE CRITICAL INGREDIENT IN GREAT CONTENT WHICH IS WHY HBO HAS NEVER PRODUCED ANYTHING WORTH WATCHING. EVEN THEY ADMIT IT'S NOT TV. MIRRIAD MAKES GREAT CONTENT POSSIBLE BY RETROACTIVELY INSERTING BRANDS INTO RERUNS. JUST LOOK HOW THEY HAVE TAKEN THIS OLD EPISODE OF USA'S WHITE COLLAR AND TURNED A NONDESCRIPT BUILDING INTO A SUBWAY SANDWICH SHOP THIS IS A WHOLE NEW PLOT TWIST. DID SOMEONE KIDNAP JARED? OR DID HE JUST GET LOST INSIDE HIS OLD PANTS. WELL, NATION, I'M EXCITED TO LEARN THAT MY PARENT COMPANY VIACOM IS NOW A MIRRIAD CLIENT WHICH MEANS SOON, YEAH, GO AHEAD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THESE PEOPLE GET IT. THEY'RE AS EXCITED AS I AM THAT THEY COULD SOON BE INSERTING ADVERTISING INTO MY OLD SHOWS AND INCREASE MY PROFITS TENFOLD-- I MEAN, ENHANCE THE CRITICAL INGREDIENT TO BRING IN GREAT CONTENT CONSUMERS, TENFOLD. WELL, FOLKS, I WANT TO MAKE IT EASY BY PROVIDING PLENTY OF BLANK SURFACES TO BE CONTENT ENHANCED. WAIT, WHAT IS THIS? HMMMM, OH, HMMMM, HMMMM, OH. OH. (APPLAUSE)
OH. THIS SURE IS REFRESHING INTOXICATING AND OR MUSCLE MASS BUILDING. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: ESPECIALLY AFTER I START MY DAY WITH A BIG BOWL OF THESE THINGS. OH, THERE IT IS. MMM, MMM, MMM. OH, WITH A GENEROUS SERVING OF THIS, THERE YOU GO. MM, MMM, MMM. YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY'LL DIGITALLY INSERT ME ENJOYING THIS A LITTLE LATER AND I DON'T WANT TO BRAG BUT I GOT ONE OF THESE! ISN'T THIS THING AWESOME? I MEAN HOW DID THEY MAKE IT SO MUCH SMALLER OR LARGER THAN THE LAST VERSION. I MEAN WHO, WHO, WHO NEEDS THIS OLD THING ANY MORE. AND FOLKS, THOSE OF US WHO CREATE THE SHOWS WON'T EVEN FEEL THE INSERTED ADVERTISING. I MEAN THEY'LL JUST SLIP IT IN. FOR INSTANCE, I MEAN, WHAT COULD THIS BE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I MEAN, I DON'T-- I DON'T THINK YOU FEEL THIS. I WOULDN'T MIND THIS BEING JAMMED INTO MY SHOW. I MEAN IT COULD BE ANYTHING. AN ELECTRIC RAZOR. IT COULD BE A TELESCOPE OR MAYBE JUST MAYBE IT'S A DELICIOUS SUBWAY FOOT LONG. EAT FRESH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
