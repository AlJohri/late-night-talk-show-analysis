Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH! NATION, IF YOU'VE WATCHED THIS SHOW BEFORE-- AND I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU HAVE-- DID YOU KNOW THAT I ALWAYS SAY THAT ANY OLD DOG CAN HUMP YOUR LEG, BUT AN ALPHA DOG MAKES YOUR OTHER LEG WATCH. THIS IS MY ALPHA DOG OF THE WEEK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THIS WEEK'S ALPHA DOG IS CHIP WILSON C.E.O. OF THE UPSCALE YOGA CLOTHING STORE LULULEMON. NOW, WHILE OTHERS ARE BLIND TO WOMEN'S ISSUES, THIS SEEING EYE ALPHA DOG IS WOMEN'S BEST FRIEND. BACK IN 2009, HE OFFERED A UNIQUE TAKE ON WOMEN'S HISTORY WRITING: "IN THE EARLY 1970s THE PILL CAME INTO BEING. WOMEN'S LIVES CHANGED IMMEDIATELY. FEMALES NO LONGER HAD TO MAKE RELATIONSHIPS WORK. MEN'S LIVES DIDN'T CHANGE, HOWEVER, AND THEY CONTINUED TO SEARCH FOR A STAY AT HOME WIFE LIKE THEIR MOTHERS. MEN DID NOT KNOW HOW TO RELATE TO THE NEW FEMALE, THUS CAME THE ERA OF DIVORCES." (AUDIENCE REACTS) YOU HEAR THAT, LADIES? DIVORCE IS YOUR FAULT BECAUSE YOU GOT THE PILL ALLOWING YOU TO HAVE ALL KINDS OF CARE-FREE SEX. EVERY HUSBAND'S NIGHTMARE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T CALL THIS ALPHA DOG SEXIST. HE'S WAY MORE THAN THAT. FOR INSTANCE, HE'S ALSO RACIST. HE SAID THAT HE CHOSE A BRAND NAME WITH A LOT OF "Ls" IN IT AS A MARKETING TOOL BECAUSE THE SOUND DIDN'T EXIST IN JAPANESE PHONETICS, TELLING ONE JOURNALIST "IT'S FUNNY TO WATCH THEM TRY AND SAY IT." (AUDIENCE REACTS) THAT IS HI-RARIOUS! (LAUGHTER) ROH-ROH. EARLIER THIS ALPHA DOG GOT A SWAT ON THE NOSE.
YOGA PANTS ARE BEING RECALLED FOR BEING TOO SEE THROUGH. THE RECALL INVOLVES PANTING USING THE SIGNATURE FABRIC THAT IS COMBINATION OF NIGH LOB AND LYCRA. THIS IS 17% OF ALL LULULEMON BOTTOMS.
CUSTOMERS HAVE NOTICED THEIR WORKOUTS ARE LOOKING MORE LIKE A PIPE SHOW SAYING LULULEMON'S PANTS ARE SEE THROUGH, LEAVING LITTLE TO THE IMAGINATION.
NOW THE COMPANY IS GETTING COMPLAINTS ABOUT TWO OTHER STYLES OF PANTS. CUSTOMERS SAY THEY'RE SCRATCHY, PILLING, AND ONCE AGAIN SEE THROUGH.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. LULULEMON RECALLED ITS TRANSPARENT YOGA PANTS FOR WOMEN WHICH CAUSED A HUGE DROP IN STOCK PRICE FOLLOWED BY A HUGE DROP IN MEN GOING TO YOGA CLASS. (LAUGHTER) BUT EVEN AFTER TURNING SUN SAL YOU STATIONS INTO FULL MOONS-- (LAUGHTER) -- THIS ALPHA DOG REFUSED TO MUZZLE HIMSELF. HE REVEALED WHY HIS PANTS WERE NOT ONLY SEE THROUGH BUT SUFFERED THE PILLING.
FRANKLY, SOME WOMEN'S BODIES JUST DON'T WORK FOR IT. AND THAT COULD BE --
Stephen: .
THEY DON'T WORK FOR THIS PANT?
NO, THEY DON'T WORK FOR CERTAIN -- SOME WOMEN'S BODIES. JUST, YOU KNOW, IT'S ABOUT THE RUBBING THROUGH THE THIGHS, HOW MUCH PRESSURE THERE. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. LULULEMON C.E.O. THINKS HIS PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE AND IT'S YOUR FAULT BECAUSE AS PATANJALI SAYS IN THE YOGA SUTRA "CULTIVATE FRIENDLINESS TO THE HAPPY, COMPASSION FOR THE UNHAPPY, DELIGHT IN THE VIRTUOUS AND INDIFFERENCE TOWARD THE WICKED. ALSO, NO FATTIES." (LAUGHTER) NOW, NOT EVERY C.E.O. HAS THE MARKETING SAVVY TO LIVE BY THE MANTRA "THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS FAT." (LAUGHTER) BUT CHIP HERE KNOWS THAT CALLING OUT YOUR CLIENTELE'S CHUB-RUB IS JUST GOOD MARKETING. IT MAKES THEM FEEL INSECURE ABOUT THEIR BODIES, THAT'S CAUSING THEM TO WORK OUT MORE WHICH MEANS THEY NEED MORE ATHLETIC CLOTHES-- CHA-CHING. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, CHA-CHING IS ALSO CHIP WILSON'S NICKNAME FOR CHINESE PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) HI-RARIOUS! AND AFTER HIS CRITICS BARKED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO ROLL OVER AND APOLOGIZE HE RELEASED THIS HEART FELT STATEMENT.
I'M SAD. I'M REALLY SAD. I'M SAD FOR THE PEOPLE AT LULULEMON WHO I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT. I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THAT HAS OCCURRED AND THE IMPACT IT HAS HAD ON YOU. I'M SORRY TO HAVE PUT YOU ALL THROUGH THIS.
Stephen: YOU HEAR THAT, LADIES? CHIP WILSON IS SAD THAT YOUR CHAFING HAM HOCKS MADE HIM PUT HIS EMPLOYEES THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT TIME. THAT STILL WASN'T ENOUGH FOR THE HOUNDS IN THE MEDIA.
NO APPARENT APOLOGY TO CUSTOMERS, NO EXPLANATION AT ALL.
CON FROM A MARKETING STANDPOINT CHIP WILSON'S APOLOGY IS KIND OF A DISASTER. SEEMS LIKE HE'S SAYING "I'M SORRY I GOT CAUGHT" BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM SORRY HE SAID IT.
SOME ARE CALLING IT THE WORST "I'M SORRY" EVER.
Stephen: THAT'S RIDICULOUS! IT WAS A PERFECTLY GOOD APOLOGY. BUT SOME WOMEN'S BODIES JUST DON'T WORK FOR IT. IF CHIP'S "I'M SORRY" WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH, YOU PROBABLY COULDN'T HEAR HIM PROPERLY OVER THE LOUD RUBBING OF YOUR FAT THIGHS. (LAUGHTER) SO THANK YOU, CHIP WILSON, FOR LIFTING YOUR THROWING PEE ON YOUR CUSTOMERS AND THEN BLAMING THEM FOR BEING WET. YOU, SIR, ARE MY ALPHA DOG OF THE WEEK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
