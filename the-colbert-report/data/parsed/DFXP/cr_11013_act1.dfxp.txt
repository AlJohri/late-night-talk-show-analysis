(EAGLE CAW)
Stephen: TONIGHT, EBOLA ARRIVES IN MANHATTAN, BUT CAN ONLY AFFORD TO LIVE IN QUEENS. (LAUGHTER) THEN HOW ARE GAY SOLDIERS HARMING OUR MILITARY? IF YOU DON'T ASK, I'LL STILL TELL YOU. (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST, MEREDITH VIEIRA IS STARTING HER OWN TALK SHOW AFTER ELEVEN SEASONS HOSTING "WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE." I GUESS THEY   FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE WHO WANTED TO BE A MILLIONAIRE. (LAUGHTER) DUNKIN' DONUTS SAYS THEIR CROISSANT DOUGHNUT IS NOT A CRONUT. BUT THEY'RE STICKING TO THEIR WILD CLAIM THAT IT'S BREAKFAST. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"! ♪♪ (EAGLE CAW) ♪♪ (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." HOME OF THE THUNDERING CALVES FOLKS, IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOR NOW. IT'S DAY 29 OF AMERICA'S EBOLA CRISIS. JESUS! OKAY. PLEASE. (LAUGHTER) JIMMY? THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) THIS THING IS GOING TO KILL US ALL. OF COURSE, I HAVE BEEN TRACKING THE VIRUS ON MY SEXY C.D.C. TECHNICIAN CALENDAR. I WOULD NOT MIND CATCHING WHAT THAT GUY'S GOT. I AM NOT -- I AM NOT -- I AM NOT SOMETHING. I'M SURE I'LL GET TO IT IN A MINUTE. (LAUGHTER) NOW I'M NOT ONE OF THESE FEAR-MONGERERS  WHO WILL TELL YOU THAT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO DIE. JUST 90% OF YOU. (LAUGHTER) THE OTHER 10% WILL LIVE IN A POST-APOCALYPTIC AFTERSCAPE RULED BY GANGS OF PSYCHOPATHIC BIKER CHICKS WHO SERVE THE SPICE LORD TARGOTH. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THE EBOLA CRISIS JUST HIT AMERICA WHERE WE LIVE. IF BY "WE" YOU MEAN "I."
EBOLA HAS COME TO NEW YORK! EBOLA NOW IN AMERICA'S LARGEST CITY.
A CONFIRMED CASE OF EBOLA IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY.
Stephen: EBOLA HAS COME TO NEW YORK! AND IF THEY CAN SPREAD IT HERE, THEY'LL SPREAD IT EVERYWHERE! (LAUGHTER) (SINGING)
I DON'T KNOW ALL THE WORDS TO THAT SONG. I'LL ADMIT IT. BEFORE, I WASN'T REALLY WORRIED BECAUSE EBOLA WAS ONLY IN FARAWAY PLACES I'LL NEVER GO, LIKE LIBERIA OR DALLAS. (LAUGHTER) BUT NOW, THE (BLEEP) HAS HIT THE FAN. WHICH IS THE NUMBER-ONE WAY TO SPREAD EBOLA! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I'VE JUST GOT TO CALM DOWN! I'LL JUST CLOSE MY EYES AND GO TO MY HAPPY PLACE. JESUS! WHY DID I MAKE MY HAPPY PLACE LIBERIA?! NOW, THE PATIENT WHO'S KEEPING THE CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS AWAKE AT NIGHT IS A DOCTOR WHO JUST RETURNED FROM TREATING EBOLA PATIENTS IN GUINEA. HE KNEW HE WAS AT RISK, SO UPON RETURNING FROM AFRICA, HE STAYED HOME FROM WORK. WHICH THOUGHTFULLY KEPT HIM AWAY FROM HIS CO-WORKERS... AND GAVE HIM PLENTY OF TIME TO EXPLORE THIS MAGNIFICENT CITY!
OFFICIALS ARE NOW TRACING HIS FAIRLY EXTENSIVE MOVEMENTS IN THE HOURS BEFORE HIS DIAGNOSIS.
SPENCER STOPPED HERE IN THE GREENWICH VILLAGE AT THE MEATBALL SHOP.
HE VISITED THE HIGH LINE, A VERY POPULAR TOURIST DESTINATION HERE.
WEDNESDAY, HE GOES ON A THREE-MILE RUN.
Stephen: A THREE-MILE RUN? HE WORKS OUT MORE THAN I DO WITHOUT EBOLA. (LAUGHTER) AND THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.
WE JUST FOUND OUT HE RODE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
HE RODE TWO, MAYBE THREE DIFFERENT SUBWAYS.
Stephen: GREAT! EBOLA SPREADS BY TOUCHING BLOOD OR FECES -- THOSE ARE YOUR ONLY TWO SEATING OPTIONS ON THE SUBWAY! (LAUGHTER) THANKFULLY, THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN BECAUSE, ON FRIDAY, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE AND NEW YORK GOVERNOR -- UH, ONE OF THE CUOMOS -- HARPO? (LAUGHTER) -- ANNOUNCED BOTH STATES WOULD ENFORCE A MANDATORY 21-DAY QUARANTINE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS COME INTO CONTACT WITH EBOLA PATIENTS, EVEN IF THEY HAVE NO SYMPTOMS -- WHICH, I HEAR, IS THE FIRST SYMPTOM. (LAUGHTER) LEADING TO THE IMMEDIATE QUARANTINE OF A NURSE RETURNING FROM EBOLA-STRICKEN SIERRA LEONE, KACI HICKOX, WHO, AFTER LANDING AT NEWARK AIRPORT, UNDERWENT HOURS OF INTERROGATION, AND WHEN A FOREHEAD SCANNER RECORDED HER TEMPERATURE AS 101 DEGREES, AUTHORITIES LEFT HER IN THE ROOM FOR ANOTHER THREE HOURS. STILL, BETTER THAN FLYING INTO LA GUARDIA. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) SHE WAS THEN TAKEN TO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN NEWARK AND PLACED IN A LUXURIOUS TENT STRUCTURE OUTSIDE WITH A PORTAPOTTY, NO SHOWER AND NO CONNECTION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD EXCEPT HER iPhone. BIG DEAL. THROW IN A SPACE HEATER, A SIXER OF LABATTS, AND YOU'RE BASICALLY ICE FISHING. (LAUGHTER) UNFORTUNATELY, SHE USED HER iPhone TO GRIPE TO THE MEDIA ABOUT THE FORCIBLE IMPRISONMENT.
I HAVE BEEN ASYMPTOMATIC SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE. I COMPLETELY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. IT'S NOT BASED ON ANY CLEAR PUBLIC HEALTH EVIDENCE. AND IT'S NOT THE RECOMMENDATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL EXPERTS AT THIS POINT. THIS IS AN EXTREME THAT IS REALLY UNACCEPTABLE, AND I FEEL LIKE MY BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED.
Stephen: HUMAN RIGHTS? I'M SORRY, MA'AM, BUT THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT SAY YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO ENDANGER YOUR NEIGHBORS. UNLESS IT'S WITH A GUN. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) A LOT OF GUN FANS HERE TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER) FACED WITH THIS OUTBREAK OF BAD P.R., GOVERNOR -- OH, WHAT'S-HIS-CUOMO -- BACKED DOWN, CHANGING NEW YORK'S RULE TO JUST THREE WEEKS WITHOUT LEAVING THE HOUSE -- OR AS MOST PEOPLE CALL IT, "WAITING FOR TIME-WARNER CABLE." (LAUGHTER) AND NOW, NEW JERSEY IS LETTING HICKOX GO HOME. EVEN CHRISTIE HAS FOLDED LIKE A HASTILY-ERECTED EBOLA TENT. (LAUGHTER) BUT HE KNOWS, ULTIMATELY, EVERYONE WILL SEE HE DID THE RIGHT THING.
I KNOW SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE. BUT THE FACT IS I HAVE A MUCH GREATER, BIGGER RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE OF THE PUBLIC, SO I THINK, WHEN SHE HAS TIME TO REFLECT, SHE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT, AS WELL.
Stephen: YES, SHE'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN SHE HAS MORE TIME TO REFLECT THAN FOUR DAYS ALONE IN A PLASTIC TENT. WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING, FOLKS! BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PROTECT OURSELVES ANYMORE. JUST ASK THE CABLE NEWS!
I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT OFF. I'M ALSO GOING TO PUT A LITTLE CHOCOLATE SAUCE IN MY HAND, WHICH COULD REPRESENT A POSSIBLE EBOLA CONTAMINATION. TAKE A LOOK. PUT THE MASK BACK ON. SO HERE WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY CONTAMINATED AREA, MY GLOVES, MAYBE THE FRONT OF MY GOWN, A BIT LIKE THIS. NOW I GOT TO TREAT THIS AS IF I'M POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED. SO NOW TAKE A LOOK. RIGHT THERE, SEE A LITTLE BIT OF CHOCOLATE SAUCE. ONE POSSIBLE EXPOSURE. AND OVER HERE ON MY NECK, ONE POSSIBLE EXPOSURE.
Stephen: THAT'S TERRIFYING. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP EBOLA IS WETNAPS! (LAUGHTER) GUPTA CLEARLY BLEW THE PROTOCOLS. SO NATION, ONCE AGAIN, IT FALLS TO ME TO PROPERLY DEMONSTRATE HOW TO ISOLATE THIS VIRUS. I'LL USE THIS BOWL OF VANILLA ICE CREAM TO REPRESENT A STERILE SEALED HOSPITAL ROOM. NOW, SOMEONE WITH EBOLA COMES IN, THEY GOT THEIR BODILY FLUIDS. ALL RIGHT, ALL OVER THE STERILE ROOM. OBVIOUSLY, BLOOD IS ONE OF THE WAYS IT IS TRANSMITTED. THEN, THIS IS THEIR SALIVA. IT'S A LITTLE FROTHY. THEY MIGHT HAVE RABIES AS WELL. (LAUGHTER) THESE REPRESENT THEIR SNEEZE PARTICLES, OKAY? RIGHT THERE. (LAUGHTER) AND ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS OF EBOLA IS BLEEDING FROM THE EYEBALLS, SO... THERE YOU GO. (LAUGHTER) SO NOW YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE DANGEROUS CONTAMINANTS TOGETHER. BUT YOU CAN STAY SAFE, AS LONG AS YOU AVOID ALL CONTACT. (LAUGHTER) THOUGH, I GOTTA SAY, THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HURT TO HAVE A LITTLE EBOLA. MM-MM-MM, MM-MMM... (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S MY EBOLA CHEAT DAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
