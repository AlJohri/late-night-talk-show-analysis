Stephen:  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LOVELY PEOPLE, THANK YOU SO MUCH, VERY NICE, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, AS IMPORTANTS AS FOOTBALL IS THERE ARE OTHER STORIES OUT THERE. FOR INSTANCE THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD SPEAKING TO CONGRESS. LAST NIGHT I WAS RIVETED TO THE STATE OF THE UNION IN THAT I HAD SURGEONS RIVET MY EYELIDS OPEN TO MAKE ME WATCH IT. NOW FOLKS, I GOT TO SAY, I AM GLAD I DID BECAUSE THIS WAS OBAMA'S FIFTH TIME BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS. TRADITIONALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ADDRESS OF ANY PRESIDENCY, I MEAN WHO AMONG US CAN FORGET THESE IMMORTAL WORDS FROM GEORGE W. BUSH'S FIFTH STATE OF THE UNION.
HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRIDS.
Stephen: THAT WAS A BIG PROBLEM BACK THEN. THAT WAS A BIG PROBLEM BACK THEN, WE FORGET HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM THAT WAS BACK THEN. IF PRESIDENT BUSH HADN'T WARNED US ABOUT IT, RIGHT NOW YOUR COWORKER WOULD BE A LABRA-DUDE. AND YOUR SON WOULD BE PLAYING SOCCER AGAINST PUMA BOY. WHO IS REALLY VERY GOOD. VERY FAST PLAYER WELL, FOLKS. HIS FIFTH STATE OF THE UNION HAD A STRONG CENTRAL THEME.
LET'S MAKE THIS THE YEAR OF ACTION.
Stephen: AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO START A YEAR OF ACTION THAN WITH AN HOUR OF TALKING. (LAUGHTER) AND OH DID HE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS,.
Stephen: TODAY WOMEN MAKE UP ABOUT HALF OUR WORKFORCE. BUT THEY STILL MAKE 77 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR A MAN EARNS THAT IS WRONG. AND IN 2014 IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT. IT IS TIME TO DO AWAY WITH WORKPLACE POLICIES THAT BELONG IN A MADMEN EPISODE.
Stephen: WORKPLACE POLICY AS THAT BELONG IN A MADMEN EPISODE. I'M SORRY I KNOW YOU ARE JUST SAYING THAT TO DISTRACT FROM YOUR DOMESTIC SPYING PROGRAM THAT BELONGS IN A HOMELAND EPISODE. NOW SPEAKING OF DISTRACTIONS JOE BIDEN NOW TAKE A LOOK, I WANT TO YOU TAKE A LOOK, A LITTLE BIT OF FOOTAGE HERE. WE FOUND SOME FOOTAGE. AND I WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT THE EXACT MOMENT WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENT STRIPPED THE EVENT OF ALL DIGNITY. (LAUGHTER) NOW WHO IS HE POINTING AT? WELL, BELTWAY GOSSIP SAYS THAT HE WAS POINTING TO A DUDE HE MET AT AN AIRPORT CHILIS THE NIGHT BEFORE. SEE, I TOLD YOU I WAS VICE PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, OBAMA SAID OTHER STUFF TOO. BUT THE REAL HIGHLIGHT OF EVERY STATE OF THE UNION IS THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE. AND LAST NIGHT WAS SO HISTORICAL WITH THE REPUBLICANS BROUGHT THEIR A GAME AS IN A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING. YOU HAD YOUR MIKE LEE FOR THE TEA PARTIERS. RAND PAUL FOR THE OTHER TEA PARTIERS. AND CUBAN AMERICAN CONGRESSWOMAN ILIAN-- ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN FOR LOSS PARTY GRANDE DEL TEA. NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF REPUBLICAN YOU ARE THERE WAS A SPEECH FOR YOU, LIKE YOUR OWN PERSONAL SLEEP NUMBER BUT FOR RAGE. AND THAT IS NOT EVEN INCLUDING THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE FROM HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE CHAIR AND STAY AT HOME CONGRESSWOMAN KATHY McMORRIS ROGERS. THE BIG QUESTION IS, HOW WOULD SHE RANK ON A SCALE OF RUBBIO TO 10. JIM?
YOU KNOW, FIRSTOFF, IT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM THAT SHE DIDN'T PROVIDE CONTENT FOR A WEEK'S WORTH OF THE LATE NIGHT.
SHE DIDN'T DO ANY HARM.
I DON'T THINK ANYONE DID ANY HARM. I DON'T THINK THEY DID ANYONE ANY GOOD. THERE IS NO NURSERY RHYME, THE COW KILLED NELLY IN THE BELLY IN THE BARN, DIDN'T DO HER ANY GOOD, DIDN'T DO HER ANY HARM.
Stephen: WELL SAID, GEORGE, WELL SAID, THE WHOLE EVENING WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. BY THE WAY A COW KICKED NELLY IN THE BELLY IS ALSO THE REPUBLICAN'S PLAN FOR CONTRACEPTION. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
