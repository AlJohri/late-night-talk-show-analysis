Stephen:  TONIGHT, A NEW WAY TO STOP THE GAYS. THEN ADVICE FOR A HAPPY THANKSGIVING. DON'T BEAT A TURKEY. THEN, I SIT DOWN WITH J.J. ABRAMS WHO IS DIRECTING THE NEW "STAR WAR "MOVIES LET'S HOPE J.JVMENTD DOESN'T STAND FOR JAR-JAR. WAIT A MINUTE A SECOND, NEIL PATRICK HARRIS IS A MUTANT? THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT.    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  REPORT TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I GOT A-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU, FOLKS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON THIS, THE LAST DAY OF AMERICA, BECAUSE, FOLKS, IT IS ALL OVER. I AM-- I AM PACKING UP AND GETTING OUT OF THIS COUNTRY AND MOVING BACK TO SOUTH CAROLINA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND HERE'S WHY--
BREAKING NEWS, SENATE DEMOCRATS VOTE TO APPROVE THE SO-CALLED NUCLEAR OPTIONS.
BEFORE THE DEMOCRATS VOTED TO CHANGE THE RULES, THE NUCLEAR OPTION THROUGH THAT UP, TOTALLY CHANGED THE RULES.
THEY CHANGED FILIBUSTER RULES TO END THE 60 VOTE THRESHOLD.
Stephen:  THEY USED THE NUCLEAR OPTION. THAT WILL GIVE CONGRESS RADIATION BURNS. ( LAUGHTER ) TOO LATE! ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, THAT SCARED THE SOCKS OFF-- I'LL PACK MY UNDERWEAR SUITCASE LATER. FOLKS, WE HAVE JUST WITNESSTHE DEATH OF AN AMERICAN INSTITUTION, THE POWER OF THE MINORITY TO FILIBUSTER ANYTHING THEY DIDN'T LIKE IS ONE OF OUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES. THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS GOING TO BE, BUT IT GOT FILIBUSTERD, WHICH SHOWS HOW NECESSARY IT IS, OR ELSE THAT CRAP WOULD BE IN THE CONSTITUTION. ( LAUGHTER ) AND JUST LISTEN, JUST LISTEN TO THE FLIMSY EXCUSE OFFERED BY SENATE MAJORITY DICTATOR HARRY REID.
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, SOME 230-PLUS YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN 160 FILIBUSTERS OF EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS. HALF OF THEM HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. ONLY 23 DISTRICT COURT NOMINATIONS HAVE BEEN FILIBUSTERED IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, 23. YOU KNOW WHAT? 20 OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS.
Stephen:  HEY, REPUBLICANS WOULDN'T HAVE TO BLOCK THEM IF OBAMA NOMINATED CONSERVATIVES, LIKE, SAY, REPUBLICAN SENATOR CHUCK HAGEL. I MEAN, THAT GUY-- WHAT'S THAT? THEY FILIBUSTERED HIM, TOO? WELL, THAT JUST PROVES THEY'RE BIPARTISAN. THEY'LL FILIBUSTER ANYONE OBAMA NOMINATES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WE CAN'T TRUST THE DEMOCRATS WITH ALL THIS POWERS, FOLKS. THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT. AT HARRY REID'S PRESS CONFERENCE ANNOUNCING THE END OF THE FILIBUSTER, THEY MISSPELLED FILIBUSTER WITH TWO "Ls." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT SAYS PHILLY-BUSTERS, WHICH I ASSUME ARE COPS WHO ARREST FEMALE HORSES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATS ARE REALLY AGAINST THE FILIBUSTER. BECAUSE THEIR POSTER CLEARLY SAYS THEY'RE AGAIN-STS THIS SPEM. BUT THEY NIEWKD IT. THEY WENT AHEAD AND NIEWKD IT. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN WASHINGTON NOW? SOMETHING? WE WERE THIS CLOSE TO ACHIEVING A ZEN-LIKE STATE OF PERFECT GOVERNMENT NOTHINGNESS. NOT SINCE BUDDHA HAVE SO MANY FAT, BALD MEN WORKED SO HARD TO DO SO LITTLE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND FOLKS I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT'S NOT JUST THE SENATE. I AM SAD TO REPORT AMERICA IS LOSING THE BATTLE AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE. THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND 16 STATES HAVE LEGALIZED MAN-ON MANTWOIMONY INCLUDING JUST LAST WEEK HAWAII. IT'S ALOA TRADITIONAL VALUES, AND ALOHA, GAY MARRIAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I WISH I COULD ASSAILANT OPPOSITE. JUST LAST NIGHT, THE GOVERNMENT OF ILLINOIS SIGNED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE LEGISLATION INTO LAW. YOU KNOW WHO'S HAPPY ABOUT THAT? THEEE BEARS! WORST OF ALL, WOFERLT OF ALL, OUR MILITARY HAS FALLEN PREY TO THE HOMOSEXUAL GAY AGENDA. THREE YEARS AGO THEY DROPPED DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL. AT FIRST I FIGURED THE GAYS WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN THE MILITARY, THE THE CAMEO IS SO MATCHY-MATCHY. TURNS OUT GAY PEOPLE HAVE SOME SORT OF SICK FETISH FOR SERVING THEIR COUNTRY AND NOW THEY'RE CASHING IN ON THOSE SWEET BENEFITS. JUST ASK SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND MAN WHO WAS CRYING JUST BEFORE YOU WALKED IN, CHUCK HAGEL.
WHEN THE SUPREME COURT ISSUED ITS DECISION ON THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT THIS SUMMER, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN WORKING ON PROVIDING SAME BENEFITS, SAME BENEFITS TO ALL ELIGIBLE SPOUSES, REGARDLESS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION. WE DID IT BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO SERVES OUR COUNTRY IN UNIFORM, EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY, SHOULD RECEIVE ALL THE BENEFITS THEY DESERVE AND THEY'VE EARNED.
Stephen:  FOLKS, THESE BENEFITS JUST ENCOURAGE THE DESTRUCTIVE GAY HOOK-UP CULTURE. MEETING YOUR SPOUSE IN SOME WINDOWLESS BACK ROOM TO PROVIDE HOT, SWEATY DENTAL COVERAGE. THANKFULLY, ONE BRAVE STATE, OKLAHOMA, IS FIGHTING TO REMAIN OKLA-HETERO. ITS CONSTITUTION ALREADY BANS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. OTHERWISE, OKLAHOMA WOULD BE A GAY MECCA. THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THEY HAVE TO OFFER THE GAYS-- THE MUSICAL... THAT'S IT.   ( APPLAUSE ) SO OKLAHOMA DID THE RIGHT THING AND TOOK AWAY SOME RIGHTS. JIM?
THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS STOPPED PROCESSING SAME-SEX COUPLES BENEFITS AFTER GETTING AN ORDER FROM GOVERNOR MARY FALLON, DESPITE THE PENTAGON'S ANNOUNCEMENT LAST MONTH THAT SAME-SEX SPOUSES OF MILITARY MEMBERS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SAME BENEFITS AS STRAIGHT COUPLES.
Stephen:  SORRY, L.G.B.T. CROWD, YOU GOT GREEDY. IF YOU LET US KEEP DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL, NOBODY WOULD KNOW IF YOUR SAME-SEX PARTNER WAS GAY. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, ACCORDING TO SOME OBSCURE THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, DENYING RIGHTS TO A SPECIFIC MINORITY GROUP IS ILLEGAL. SO GOVERNOR FALLON IS ENSURING THAT ALL OKLA-HUMANS ARE TREATED EQUALLY BY ORDERING STATE-OWNED NATIONAL GUARD FACILITIES TO STOP PROCESSING ALL MILITARY SPOUSE BENEFITS. NOW, EVERY OKLAHOMA NATIONAL GUARD MEMBER WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL TO A FEDERALLY RUN FACILITY TO APPLY FOR BENEFITS. IN SOME CASES, THAT WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL FOUR-HOUR ROAD TRIP. IT WILL BE FUN. YOU CAN PLAY A GAME OF EYE SPY AND ARBITRARY DENIAL OF MY RIGHTS. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, GOVERNOR FALLON IS SETTING A GREAT PRECEDENT HERE. RATHER THAN PROVIDE ANY SERVICES FOR GAY PEOPLE, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REFUSE TO PROVIDE THEM FOR EVERYONE. BECAUSE ONCE A GAY PERSON GETS SOMETHING, IT GETS THEIR GAY ALL OVER IT. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHY I THINK WE SHOULD SHUT DOWN THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS. IF I FIND OUT THAT FIREFIGHTERS ALSO RESCUE GUY PEOPLE, SUDDENLY, IT WILL SEEM GAY FOR ME TO HAVE THEIR CALENDAR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S MARCH. THAT'S MARCH. THAT'S A GOOD ONE. AND WHAT ABOUT SCHOOLS? I'VE HEARD SOME OF THESE NEW-FANGLED GAYS ALSO HAVE KIDS THAT GO TO SCHOOL. THEY'RE LEARNING THE SAME MATH AS MY KIDS, ALL SO THEY CAN GO HOME AND COUNT THE NUMBER OF MOMMIES THEY HAVE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, FOLKS, WE WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF GAYS WEREN'T ALLOWED IN THE MILITARY. SO NO ONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN THE MILITARY. I SAY LET THOSE DRONES DO ALL THE WORK. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY'RE STILL MOKS AWAY FROM DEVELOPING A SEXUAL PREFERENCE. BUT ONCE THEY DO, THEY'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM CONNECTING WITH THEIR SOUL MATES OR ANY OF THEIR COLLATERAL SOUL MATES. YOU KNOW WHAT? EVEN THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH, FOLKS. BECAUSE GOVERNOR FALLON, I HEARD THAT GAY PEOPLE IN OKLAHOMA ENJOY THE CENT OF YOUR FLOWER, THE OKLAHOMA ROSE AS MUCH AS STRAIGHT PEOPLE DO SHOW YOU CAN SHHH ORDER EVERYONE IN YOUR STATE TO CUT OFF THEIR NOSES TO SPITE THE GAYS BECAUSE YOU'RE KIND OF DOING IT ALREADY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
