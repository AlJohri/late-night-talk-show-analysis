[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A NETWORK  NEWS ICON WHO HAS BEEN IN  JOURNALISM SINCE THE 60'S. I'LL ASK HIM WHERE HE WAS WHEN  HE HEARD THE NEWS THAT I WAS  BORN. PLEASE WELCOME TOM BROKAW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TOM, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR COMING. SIT DOWN. ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE BEEN DOING --
THE AUDIENCE HAS GOTTEN AN  EXINTEREST DOSE OF AM PET MEANS  TONIGHT.
Stephen: THEY HAVE. THEY SCORED THEM FROM HSBC. HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING EXCITING  LATELY. EVERY TIME I TALK TO YOU I TRY  TO BRAG WITH SOMETHING FUN. I SAID I HAD JUST COME BACK FROM  NEW ZEALAND FLY FISHING AND YOU  SAID, YOU SAID I JUST CAME BACK FROM FLY FISHING WITH GORBACHEV. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE THAT IS ONLY  BROKAWESQUE?
I'M GETTING READY TO GO ON A  BIG BIKING TRIP IN PATAGONIA.
Stephen: REALLY? MUST BE NICE BE TOM BROKAW.
IT'S NOT BAD.
Stephen: YOU ARE HIM. YOU'VE BEEN HIM FOR YEARS NOWCH  AS A MAN DRIN OF THE NEWS  BUSINESS. YOU'VE COVERED NINE PRESIDENTS  SINCE J.F.K. WHAT DOES A SECOND TERM MEAN TO  THE PRESIDENT?
IT MEANS IT'S A PERILOUS  ENTERPRISE BECAUSE THE A-TEAM  GOES AWAY.
Stephen: MR. T AND --
EXACTLY RIGHT. THEY HAVE QUALIFIED PEOPLE. AND THERE'S ALWAYS A LOSS OF  PRESIDENTIAL FOCUS. RONALD REAGAN DID A VERY GOOD  JOB OF WINDING DOWN THE COLD WAR  BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD THE IRAN CONTRA SCANDALS GOING ON IN  HIS SEC TERM.
Stephen: WHAT IS OBAMA'S  SCANDAL. THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN  GOING AFTER HIM WITH BIG GUNS. BENGHAZI, THE CORBOMIGHT  MANEUVER? IT'S JUST AN EPISODE OF STAR  TREK BUT IT SOUNDS DANGEROUS. WHAT ARE THEY GOING AFTER HIM  WITH HIM?
THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ON  WHAT WAS NOT SO SUCCESSFUL IS  THAT HE HAS SOCIALIST POLICIES IN MIND AND THAT HE IN THE EYES  OF A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES IS  SOMEBODY IS NOT TRULY AN  AMERICAN.
Stephen: WELL, THE EVIDENCE  IS THE EXECUTIVE OVER REACH. HE IS CLEARLY TYRANT. RAND PAUL SAID WE DON'T LIKE  KINGS IN THIS COUNTRY. WE DON'T LIKE KINGS AND KING  OBAMA THE FIRST SIGNED AN  EXECUTIVE ORDER TODAY, OKAY. THAT IS COUNTERMANNING THE  SECOND AMENDMENT. IS HE GOING TO BE IMPEACHED? S BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE CALLING  FOR THAT?
THERE ARE PEOPLE CALLING FOR  IT AND IT WON'T HAPPEN.
Stephen: CLINTON WAS.
THAT WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.
Stephen: THAT WASN'T  EXECUTIVE OVER REACH IT WAS  UNDER REACH.
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHO WAS  REACHING FOR WHOM IN THAT CASE.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND. THAT'S HOW HE GOT OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE. ALL RIGHT. SO -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- YOU COVERED -- THERE ONE OF  THESE PRESIDENTS THAT YOU  COVERED THAT YOU LIKE MORE THAN OTHERS THAT IMPRESS YOUED YOU MORE  THAN OTHER?
THEY ALL HAD DIFFERENT  QUALITIES.
Stephen: OH, COME ON! THERE'S GOT BE. YOU ARE THE MOST EVENHANDED  PERSON IN THE WORLD.
I'M FASCINATED BY PEOPLE WHO  FIRST OF ALL GET INTO THE ARENA  AND RUN SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF UNITED STATES,  MAKE THEM AN HISTORIC FIGURE,  OCCUPY THE MOST POWERFUL OFFICE IN THE WORLD. IT TAKES A LOT OF PERSONAL  COURAGE TO DO THAT AND ENORMOUS  EEG YES AND DETERMINATION TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE COUNTY.
Stephen: WINNING OR  RUNNING?
BOTH. TO SEE HOW COMFORTABLE THEY ARE  IN THE OFFICE OF GREAT POWER. FOR EXAMPLE, IT'S WELL KNOWN  THAT AMONG HIS AIDE AND THE  PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY HE IS NOT A GREAT  PEOPLE PERSON. HE DOESN'T LIKE HANGING OUT WITH  HAVING PEOPLE OVER AND ROLLING  UP HIS SLEEVES. RONALD REAGAN WAS A SHY,  RESERVED MAN. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS.
Stephen: REALLY?
HE HAD A GUARD IN FRONT OF  HIM BUT HE KNEW HOW TO PLAY THE  GAME. HIS STAFF OF JAMES BAKER AND  MICHAEL DEAVER AND OTHERS WOULD  PUT TOGETHER GROUPS AND HE WOULD BE COMFORTABLE. GEORGE BUSH 41 WAS VERY PAR  TRITIONED. HE CAME FROM A PROMINENT NEW  ENGLAND FAX HIS SON BROUGHT THE  TEXAS HO DOWN ATTITUDE ABOUT IT GETTING THINGS DONE.
Stephen: DID YOU BECOME  FRIENDS WITH THESE GUYS?
I DON'T THINK FRIENDS. WITH EACH OF THEM I HAD MY KIND  OF DEGREE OF RELATIONSHIP. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE  HAPPENED TO RUN INTO PRESIDENT  OBAMA WITH MY FAMILY. AND MY DAUGHTER WHO IS IN SAN  FRANCISCO WAS AN EARLY AND  ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTER. SHE SAID, MR. PRESIDENT I WAS  WITH YOU EARLY AND I'M STILL  WITH YOU, HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER AND SAID, TALK TO YOUR DAD,  IF YOU WOULD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: A GREAT TOM BROKAW  STORY. CONGRESS HAS MOVED OUR ECONOMY  INTO A LEAN-TO UP AGAINST THE  EDGE OF A FISCAL CLIFF AND THEY ARE PUTTING DOWN STAKES. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO LIVE  FROM NOW ON. HAS IT ALWAYS BEEN THUS THAT  WE'RE IN A CONSTANT TATE OF  CRISIS IN CONGRESS?
NO.
Stephen: IT'S EXCITING. I CHECK THE PAPERS IN THE  MORNING TO SEE IF THERE'S AN  ECONOMY. YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT THRESHOLD  OF EXCITEMENT THAN I DO. IF THAT IS WHAT GETS YOU OFF.
Stephen: VERY OPEN MINDED  OF YOU. VERY OPEN MINDED OF YOU. YOU KNOW WHO LIVED AN EXCITING  LIFE DAMN MA CLOSE. DO YOU THINK DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS  WILL CHANGE OUR POLICIES IN.
I DO. I THINK TEXAS WILL BE AN  ENTIRELY POLITICAL PIECE OF  GEOGRAPHY AS A RESULT OF LATINO VOTE ACROSS THE BORDER THERE AND  THE WAY THEY ARE SPREADING OUT  INTO OTHER DISTRICTS. AND THE REPUBLICAN --
Stephen: BUT AS LONG AS THE  WHITE AMERICANS MAINTAIN A  MAJORITY, THE REPUBLICANS ARE  SAFE?
IT'S A SMALLER MAJORITY AS  THEY LEARNED THIS LAST TIME  AROUND AND IT'S ALSO NOT FOR THEM A HOM MOG USENUOS. PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS HELPED BY  THE VARIOUS ETHNIC GROUPS BUT  ONE SAID THEY TURNED OUT A LARGER PORTION OF THE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE THIS TIME  THAN THEY DID THE FIRST TIME HE  RAN. AND THE ROMNEY PEOPLE THOUGHT IT  WOULD GO THE OTHER WAY.
Stephen: I WAS SURPRISED BY  THAT, TOO. I WAS SURPRISED THAT FOUR YEARS  LATER AFRICAN-AMERICANS HADN'T  GOTTEN OVER THAT FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT THING. IT HAPPENED. MOVE ON. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK WHAT THEY THOUGHT WHEN  THEY LOOKED AT THE CAMPAIGN IS  THAT WHO IS GOING TO TAKE THE BEST CARE OF ME IN THE NEXT FOUR  YEARS?
Stephen: ARE WHITE PEOPLE  REALLY GOING BE IN A MINORITY IN  A FEW YEARS?
NOT FOR A WHILE.
Stephen: JUST CHECKING. THANK YOU SO MUCH,
