(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THE EVERYBODY WHO WATCHES THIS SHOW KNOWS I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR TIME SAVERS. THAT'S WHY I LOVE THOSE HELPFUL SPOILER ALERTS. ROSE BUD'S A SLED, HE WAS DEAD THE WHOLE TIME AND THE DUDES FOUND THEIR CAR. SEE, I JUST SAVED YOU ALL SIX HOURS. CHALK IT UP TO MY GENERATION, BUT ME AND MY FELLOW MILLENNIALS DON'T LIKE TO WAIT. WE WANT OUR FOOD FAST, OUR GRAMS INSTA, OUR MOBS FLASH AND WE WANT IT ALL NOW. ACTUALLY, NOW -- THAT NOW IS TOO LATE. SO THIS NOW -- NOPE, MISSED IT AGAIN. READING ARTICLES ON THE INTERNETS TAKES FOREVER, THAT'S WHY I WAS THRILLED TO SEE A NEW TIME-SAVING FEATURE ON NEWS, OPINION, AND STONE ROOFING SUPPLY SITE slate.com. (LAUGHTER) ON ITS LINKS IT TELLS YOU HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO READ A STORY. (AUDIENCE REACTS) AS SLATE EXPLAINS, PEOPLE COMPLAINED QUITE REASONABLY ABOUT NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY WOULD FIND BEHIND EACH LINK, A TWO-SENTENCE BLOG POST, A 12-PAGE EXPO SIGS. THIS WILL GIVE READERS ADVANCED NOTE ABOUT WHAT THEY'LL GETTING THEMSELVES INTO. THANK YOU! CLICKING ON A STORY IS A HUGE COMMITMENT! FIRST YOU HAVE TO AIM THE CURSOR THEN IT TAKES ABOUT TWO SECONDS TO LOAD, THEN I'VE GOT SCAN THE THING TOO SEE HOW LONG IT IS AND IF I WANT TO BACK OUT I HAVE TO RELEAD TO PAGE WHERE I CAME FROM. NOW AS MANY AS EIGHT SECONDS HAVE PASSED AND I'M THAT MUCH CLOSER TO THE COLD EMBRACE OF DEATH. (LAUGHTER) I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE BEFORE I CLICK WHETHER A STORY IS WORTH MY TIME AM I INTERESTED IN READING ABOUT A TO HELP MORE MOTHERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD EXPENSIVE HOSPITAL INCUBATORS. BUT AM I SEVEN MINUTES INTEREST SNDZ (LAUGHTER) MAYBE I'D RATHER READ A ONE-MINUTE ARTICLE ABOUT A MALAYSIAN BUSINESSMAN TRADING HOOKERS FOR NAVY SECRETS SEVEN TIMES. (LAUGHTER) SLATE EVEN SAVED ME TIME WHILE SAVING ME TIME BY WRITING "M" INSTEAD OF "MINUTE" WHICH SAVES ME PRECIOUS INUTES." (LAUGHTER) I BELIEVE SLATE IS ON TO SOMETHING HERE, FOLKS. THEY KNOW I NEED TO KNOW HOW LONG EVERYTHING IS IN MY LIFE BEFORE I COMMIT. LIKE FALLING IN LOVE. TOO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. (LAUGHTER) WILL WE KISS ON THE FIRST DATE, THE SECOND DATE? HOW LONG IS THE COURT SHIP? ONE MONTH, TWO? HOW LONG WILL OUR FIRST WEDDING DANCE BE? A 2:57 LIKE ETTA JAMES "AT LAST" OR 4 MINUTES LIKE VAN MORRISON'S "HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY THAT I LOVE YOU"? I HAVE TO KNOW! AND KIDS BRING A WHOLE NEW SET OF UNCERTAINTY. JUNIOR BALLPARK IT WHEN YOU'RE GONNA SAY YOUR FIRST WORD FOR ME. A YEAR? TWO YEARS? I'LL FIRE UP THE CAMERA FOR "DA DA" BUT "CHOO-CHOO"? I DON'T KNOW. MOMMY CAN BRIEF ME ON THAT LATER. FAR MATTER, HOW LONG WILL THE REST OF MY LIFE TAKE? 40 YEARS? I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT, I'LL BE DEAD. HOW LONG UNTIL THE FIRST SNOW? HOW LONG UNTIL SPRING? HOW LONG UNTIL I'M OUT OF RITZ CRACKERS? HOW LONG UNTIL I'M SICK OF THEM. WILL I EVER WAKE UP HAPPY? HOW LONG WILL I TAKE TO FIND MYSELF? DO I HAVE TO MOVE TO NEPAL FOR A YEAR OR CAN I LOCK IT DOWN WITH ONE SUPER MOVING POTTERY WORKSHOP? IS LIFE WORTH LIVING IF I ACTUALLY HAVE TO LIVE IT? HOW LONG UNTIL THIS SEGMENT IS OVER? JIMMY, PUT UP A COUNTDOWN CLOCK. NOW I CAN RELAX BECAUSE IF I KNOW HOW LONG IT IS UNTIL THIS
