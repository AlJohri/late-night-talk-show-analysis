Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE DIRECTOR  WHO AT THE AGE OF 26 WHO HAS  DIRECTED HIS FIRST FEATURE FILM NOMINATED FOR OSCARS. I WILL PRETEND I'M HAPPY FOR  HIM. PLEASE WELCOME BENH ZEITLIN. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: WHAT A WHIERLWIND  FOR YOU.
ABSOLUTELY. IT'S BEEN KATIA PUTTED.
Stephen: YOU REALLY HAVE. YOU ARE A FILMMAKER, COMPOSER,  AM NATEOR, SOMETHING CALLED  CLICK 14 A COLLECTIVE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SNRVELINGS A  GROUP OF ARTISTS OF ALL  DIFFERENT KINDS THAT COME TOGETHER TO MAKE THE FILMS, BOAT  BUILDERS, SCULPTURES, EVERYBODY  GETS TOGETHER.
Stephen: DID THEY WORK TON  THIS FILM?
THEY DID STOONCHTS YOU ARE  DIRECTOR AND COWRITER OF "BEASTS  OF THE SOUTHERN WILD." THIS IS YOUR FIRST FEATURE, AS I  SAID, NOMINATED FOR FOUR OSCARS. WHAT IS THAT LIKE? [LAUGHTER]
EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW. IT'S SURREAL. I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, IT'S -- WE NEVER  REALLY IMAGINED ANY OF THIS  HAPPENING. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO LOS ANGELES  BEFORE THIS HAPPENED.
Stephen: OH, YOU'RE GOING  TO LOVE IT.
IT'S A BIZARRE EXPERIENCE WE  NEVER EXPECTED ANY OF THIS.
Stephen: IT TAKES PLACE AT  THE VERY ABSOLUTE BOTTOM OF THE  MISSISSIPPI DELTA A PLACE CALLED THE BATHTUB. TELL PEOPLE WHAT IT IS. WHAT SP SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT.
IT'S A COMMUNITY AT THE WRONG  SIDE OF LEVEES AT THE BOTTOM OF  LOUISIANA.
Stephen: WHY WOULD ANYONE  LIVE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF LEVEE. THE LEVEE IS TO KEEP NATURE AWAY  FROM PEOPLE.
BUT THERE'S TOWNS THAT EXIST  DOWN THERE THAT HAVE A WAY OF  LIFE THAT EXISTS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND THEY ARE ROOTED TO THE  ENVIRONMENT THERE. THE ECONOMY IS BASED ON FISHING  AND DEGREING ALL THINGS VERY  SPECIFIC TO THE REGION. SO THE CULTURE IS BASED IN BEING  ABLE TO STAY IN THESE SPECIAL  PLACES. WHAT THE FILM IS ABOUT IS THE  WAY THE PLACES PLACES PLACES ARE ENDANGE  THE MOMENT.
Stephen: THE ECONOMY DOWN  THERE SEEMS TO BE BASED ON HEART  RENDING SANDNESS. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO IT'S --
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY IT'S  ULTIMATELY A HOPEFUL TALE BUT  IT'S HEART PIERCING AT TIMES.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, ONE  OF THE THINGS THAT THE FILM IS  ABOUT IS THE WAY IN A THE PEOPLE IN THE BATHTUB NOT JUST SURVIVED  THIS STORM BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW,  KEEP A HOLD OF THEIR JOY AND THIS CULTURE THAT IS INCREDIBLY  SELL BRA TORY AND JOYOUS.
Stephen: WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE  OF THAT, A LIP CLIP THAT TALKS  JUST TO TAKE.
BUT ME AND MY DADDY WE STAY  RIGHT HERE. WE SEE WHAT THE EARTH IS FOR. ♪ ♪  ♪ ♪
Stephen: IT IS UNBELIEVABLY  BEAUTIFUL, JOYOUS AND WILD WHEN  I FIRST SAW THAT I THOUGHT THIS IS LIKE WHERE THE WILD THINGS  ARE BUT WITH PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT IS WILD. YOU KNOW, AND WHEN YOU GO DOWN  THERE IT'S A WILD CULTURE.
Stephen: WHAT BROUGHT YOU  DOWN THERE? YOU ARE NOT FROM DOWN THERE, ARE  YOU? YOU DON'T HAVE A DEEP  LOUISIANA --
DEFINITELY NOT. MY FOLKS BROUGHT ME THERE WHEN I  WAS 13 YEARS OLD.
Stephen: ABOUT A MONTH AGO.
IT WAS LAST WEEK. [LAUGHTER] AND I WENT BACK TO START MAKING  FILMS THERE BECAUSE THE WAY THEY  SORT OF -- CREATIVITY BLEEDS OUT OF CULTURE WAS SOMETHING I  WANTED TO BE A PART OF.
Stephen: THE DAY YOU  STARTED SHOOTING IS THE DAY OF  THE DEEP WATER HORIZON BLOW UP. HOW DID THAT AFFECT YOUR  PRODUCTION AND HOW YOU THOUGHT  ABOUT THAT AREA? IMMEDIATELY IT WAS NOT JUST  ENDANGERED FROM THE STORM BUT  POISONED OUT OF EXISTENCE.
YEAH AND THESE TOWNS DOWN  THERE REALLY EXIST ON WHAT THEY  PULL OUT OF THE WATER. THERE WAS A REAL FEELING AS WE  WERE SHOOTING A LOT OF THIS FILM  THAT WE COULD BE PHOTOGRAPHING THINGS FOR LAST TIME. THERE WAS A PALPABLE SENSE THAT  WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE FILM  COULD BE HAPPENING TO THIS  PLACE. THAT AND WE WERE LITERALLY  NEGOTIATING WITH BP SCECTSIVES  TO GET THE CAMERAS ROLLING ON SOME OF THE LOCATES.
Stephen: DID THEY WANT TO  YOU ROLL?
THEY WERE LOOKING SO BAD THEY  ACTUALLY THOUGHT WE'LL SEEM NICE  IF WE HELP THE STRUGGLING FILMMAKERS TO GET OUT THERE.
Stephen: IT'S BETTER TO  SEEM NICE THAN BE NICE. [LAUGHTER] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE YOUNG LADY  THE STAR OF THIS. SHE'S NOMINATED. SHE WAS SIX YEARS OLD THE YOUNG  ACTRESS PLAYING HUSH PUPPY. QUOVEN JENAIS WALLACE.
CLOSE.
Stephen: WHAT WAS IT LIKE  TO HAVE A LEAD ACTRESS IS WHO  WAS SIX YEARS OLD? DID SHE SAY I'M NOT COMING OUT  OF MY TRAILER BECAUSE SOMEONE  EIGHT MY ANIMAL CRACKERS.
THEY WERE A BARGE BEGANNING  TOOL ON SET.
Stephen: NOMINATED FOR FOUR  OSCARS IF YOU CAN ONLY WIN ONE  WHAT WOULD IT BE?
HERS.
Stephen: SHE'S SIX. YOU ARE ALMOST 30678 IT'S ALMOST  OVER FOR YOU. TH
