IT'S ELONGATED STONCHTS  STITCHES ON THE TOP. I LOVE IT WHEN THEY PLAY THAT  GAME. [ LAUGHTER ] MINNESOTA, YOU GUYS THIS PAST  WEEKEND PLAYED GREEN BAY.
WE DID.
Stephen: WHAT SOME HAVE  CALLED THE CHOLESTEROL BOWL.
THE CHEESE BOWL I BELIEVE IS  ANOTHER NAME FOR IT.
Stephen: LANDS OF MEATZ AND  CHEESES. YOU GOT YOUR LUDIFUS HANDED TO  YOU.
I PLAYED WELL. WHEN I PLAY WELL THAT'S A SIGN  THE TEAM IS NOT PLAYING WELL.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOUR JOB  IS TO GIVE THE BALL AWAY.
I'M A PROFESSIONAL  SURRENDERER. THEY CALL ON ME AND SAY CHRIS GO  GIVE TO THE BALL TO THE OTHER  TEAM BUT DO IT IN A GOOD WAY SO WE'RE NOT HURT TO BADLY.
Stephen: SURRENDER IN THE  LEAST HUMILIATING FASHION. YOU LOVE BUT GREEN BAY IS  PRACTICING IN THE COLD AND YOU  DON'T HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW AND YOU ARE HAYING OUT WITH  CELEBRITIES.
I THINK WE SEAT WINNER HERE.
Stephen: DON'T GET ME  WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS THE LAST MOMENT OF  CAMARADERIE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. I'M ABOUT TO BRING IT AND  THERE'S NO DEFENSIVE LINE TO  PROTECT YOU. COME ON. COME ON, REALLY?
I'M A FOOTBALL PLAYER THAT'S  WHAT I DO. I FLEX.
Stephen: THAT BRINGS ME TO  IF I FIRST SUBJECT.
OKAY.
Stephen: THE STORY HERE. THE REASON WHY YOUR NAME IS  BREAK OUT ALL OVER THE PLACE IS  BECAUSE THERE WAS A BALTIMORE RAVENS PLAYER. HE CAME OUT IN SUPPORT OF  MARRIAGE EQUALITY. LETTING THE GAYS MARRY, OKAY. A MARYLAND STATE DELEGATE WHO  OPPOSED GAY MARRIAGE WROTE A  LETTER TO THE RAVENS OWNER ASKING THE MER BE SILENCED. YOU THEN WROTE A LETTER, KIND OF  ON OP-ED LETTER TO DEADSPIN.
MM-HMM.
Stephen: WHY WOULD YOU  SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE? YOU ARE IN THE MOST HYPER  MASCULINE SUPPORT IN THE WORLD  THANK IS TRUE.
Stephen: FOOTBALL PLAYERS  ARE A THOUSAND MILES FROM GAY.
YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED.
Stephen: NO, NO, MEN IN  TIGHT PANTS PATTING EACH OTHER  ON THE BUTT NOTHING GAY ABOUT  THAT. GET THAT BUTT OUT OF MY FACE. GET IT OUT OF THERE. SO ANGRY. GET THAT BUTT OUT OF HERE! [ LAUGHTER ] WHY, WHAT LED YOU TO DO THIS?
BECAUSE I FELT. FIRST OFF I BELIEVE WOULD YOU  IDENTIFY WITH THIS.
Stephen: I DO NOT IDENTIFY  WITH ANYTHING.
OKAY. THE REASON I WROTE THE LETTER  BECAUSE AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL  DELEGATE BURNS DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO STIFLE FREE SPEESM  THAT'S THE FIRST AMENDMENT. WHEN HE WROTE THE LETTER SAYING  STIFLE THIS MAN AS FREE SPEECH  IT IRKED ME AS AN AMERICAN BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT THIS  COUNTRY IS ABOUT. I FIRMLY BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE  PEOPLE AND DESERVE TO BE TREATED  THE SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: IT'S PRETTY EASY  TO PLAY THE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE  CARD. I HAPPEN TO KNOW SERVE A PERSON. YOU ARE PANDERING.
THERE'S NO CORPORATIONS OUT  THERE?
Stephen: THEY ARE ALWAYS  WELCOME HERE. I DO NOT DISCRIMINATE. YOU DIDN'T JUST LIKE TAKE ISSUE  WITH THIS GUY. YOU WROTE THINGS ALONG THIS  LINE. YOU CALLED THE DELL DID YOU GET  QUOTE "A NARCISSISTIC FRUMNDA  STAIN WHO SAID HE WAS WORRIED GAY MARRIAGE WOULD TURN HIM INTO  A QUOTE LUSTFUL (bleep)  MONSTER.
YES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ]
PLEASED TO KNOW SO FAR WITH  THE DEFEAT OF THE MARRIAGE  AMENDMENT ACT IN MINNESOTA I HAVE SEEN ZERO (bleep)  MONSTERS RUNNING AROUND IN  MINNESOTA.
Stephen: I'M SHOCKED A MAN  WHO SPENDS SO MUCH TIME IN A  LOCKER ROOM WOULD KNOW SUCH FOREIGN -- FOUL LANGUAGE IN THE  LOCKER ROOM BUT I PLAY A LOT OF  ONLINE GAMING BUT THE FORUM BOARDS ARE A CESSPOOL PIT AND  YOU CAN LEARN FOUL THINGS.
Jon: IS TROLL ON --
IT'S TROLL ON ORK.
Stephen: THAT SAY SICKNESS. YOU'VE BEEN VOCAL ABOUT GUN  CONTROL.
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD CONTROL  GUNS MORE.
Stephen: SHOULD GAY PEOPLE  BE ALLOWED TO HAVE GUNS?
IF THEY WANT TO. IF THEY ARE CONTROLLED.
Stephen: MAKES THOSE PA  RAIDS EVEN MORE FRIGHTENING.
IMAGINE IF YOU WERE AT A  PRIDE PARADE AND YOU START  THROWING ROCKS AT THE GAY PEOPLE AND ONE OF THEM PULLED OUT AN  AR-15. WOULD YOU THROW ROCKS.
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL I  WOULD NEVER THROW ROCKS AT A  PRIDE PARADE.
WHY NOT?
Stephen: I WOULD THROW  DPLITTER.
EVEN BETTER.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH  FROM THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS AND A  LOT OF EDITORIAL PAGES CHRIS
