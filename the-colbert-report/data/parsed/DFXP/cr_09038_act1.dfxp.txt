THANK YOU, THANK YOU  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I GOT TO TELL YOU. THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. I WILL TAKE THAT SOUND. I WILL TAKE THAT SOUND OVER  JINGLE BELLS ANY DAY. NATION, TONIGHT IS MY LAST  EPISODE BEFORE THREE WEEKS  OFF. BUT I'M NOT LOOKING AHEAD TO  THE BREAK. I'VE ALREADY STARTED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT IS NOT A PROP. WHOOO!
THERE ARE STILL SOME  IMPORTANT STORIES TO TALK  ABOUT THERE, FOLKS. LIKE LAST NIGHT'S  MEGACONCERT TO HELP THE  VICTIMS OF HURRICANE SANDY.
ALL EYES WERE ON NEW YORK  CITY LAST NIGHT FOR THE  12-12-12 BENEFIT SHOW TO HELP VICTIMS OF SUPERSTORM  SANDY. PAUL McCARTNEY, THE ROLLING  STONES, ERIC CLAPTON, BRUCE  SPRINGSTEEN AND BILLY JOEL WERE AMONG ALL THE ROCK 'N'  ROLL HEROES THAT CAME OUT TO  PERFORM.
Stephen: BUT THEY WERE  ALL JUST OPENING ACTS FOR  ROCK LEGEND STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I WAS HONORED. FOLKS, I GOT TO SAY, I WAS  HONORED TO BE THERE AND TO  BE JUST OFF STAGE WHERE I FILMED MICK JAGGER SHAKING  HIS SEXY BAG OF BONES. HERE WE GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  JUST ME AND MICK. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, DONATIONS  ARE STILL BEING ACCEPTED. YOU CAN HELP THE VICTIMS OF  HURRICANE SANDY WITH A $10  DO FACIAL BY TEXTING ROBIN HOOD TO 50555 WHICH I  BELIEVE IS PAUL McCARTNEY'S  CELL PHONE. (LAUGHTER)  NOW FOLKS, YOU KNOW ME, YOU  KNOW I HAVE HAD IT UP TO  HERE WITH THIS IMPERIAL  PRESIDENCY. THE ARROGANCE OF GETTING  RE-ELECTED BY RUNNING ON A  PLATFORM THAT VOTERS FIND  APPEALING SICKENS MEMENT AND NOW, AND NOW FOLKS, GET  READY FOR THIS, LADY  MICHELLE ANTOINETTE. HAS ABUSED HER POWER YET  AGAIN.
OH, THE PERKS OF BEING  FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA IS  A SELF-PROFESSED DOWNTON ABBEY FAN. SHE COULD NOT BEAR WAITING  UNTIL JANUARY 6TH FOR THE  NEW SEASON TO BEGIN SO SHE ASKED THE BRITISH FILMMAKERS  FOR A COPY NOW. SHE GOT IT.
Stephen: OH, YES, CUP CUP,  FETCH ME THE DOWNTONS. NOW, MEANWHILE WE COMMONERS  ARE LEFT TO FEAR WHAT WILL  BECOME OF DOWNTON AS IT  LURCHES IT INTO THE ROARING '20s, WILL LORD GRANTHAM  ACCEPT LABBEE CYBIL'S CHILD  WITH BRANSON. WILL THEY STAY IN PRISON  FORTH MURDER OF HIS EX-WIFE. WILL THEY ACCEPT A MARRIAGE  PROPOSAL FROM A YOUNG  CORPORAL HITLER? (LAUGHTER)  SO MANY QUESTIONS! SHE KNOWS THE ANSWERS. BUT WE DON'T. UNTIL THE SEASON PREMIER ON  JANUARY 6TH. WELL, TONIGHT FOLKS, I  STRIKE BACK AT HER HIGHNESS. BY PRESENTING YOU, MY NATION,  WITH SOMETHING NOT EVEN  MICHELLE HAS SEEN. PART OF THE SHOW VINCE  GILLIGAN HAS AGREED TO LET  ME SHOW YOU SCENES FROM THE  UPCOMING SEASON OF BREAKING  BAD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AS PERFORMED BY THE MEN OF  DOWNTON ABBEY. (LAUGHTER)  JAMES? (LAUGHTER)  THOMAS?
LORD GRANTHAM IS GROWING  IMPATIENT. IT'S TIME TO START.
RIGHT YOU ARE, ALLOW ME  TO BRING THE MOBILE LAB. THERE WE GO, MR. JOHNSON.
THANK YOU. IT'S A SHAME THAT IN ORDER  TO SAVE DOWNTON ABBEY LORD  GRANTHAM HAS SUNK TO BREWING THE BLACK CAME CHEIL CRANK.
STOP BEING SO HIGH AND  MIGHTY. THE VILLAGE TEA TWIKERS  CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT, EARL  BLUE, THEY THINK IT IS THE CHIZ EL MIZ EL. CARSON, THOMAS, HURRY UP  WITH THAT BATCH. I PROMISED TO BUY THE  PRODUCT AND A GENTLEMAN  KEEPS HIS WORD. OR ONE HAS A CAP POPPED IN  ONE'S AS.
SOON DOWNTON WILL BE  CONNECTING IT WITH MAD  BITCHES AND BENJAMINS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IM.
YO, YOU GOT SOMETHING IN  MIND.
CARSON, IS SOMEONE  ADDRESSING ME? SORRY.
MY LORD, A MR. SPIDER TO  SEE YOU.
AH, YES, WHAT CAN I DO  FOR YOU PIE GOOD MAN?

WHO GAVE YOU THE RECIPE?
I MUST HAVE GOTTEN IT  FROM MR. BATES. I TOLD YOU UNRELIABLE.
BUT I NEVER GAVE BATES  THE RECIPE.
NO, WAIT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
CONGRATULATIONS, MY LORD. ARE YOU NOW THE KEY KINGPIN  OF YOUR CHAIR.
YES, BUT IT'S A MIXED  BLESSING. AS BYRON ONCE SAID, MO MONEY,  MO QUANDARIES.
CARSON YOU DROPPED  SOMETHING.
I CAN EXPLAIN, MY LORD.

Stephen: ALL FOR YOU,  NATION, ALL FOR YOU. AND TUNE IN NEXT TIME WHEN  BRIAN CRANSTON WILL REENACT  SCENES FROM MALCOLM IN THE  MIDDLE. THAT GOING TO BE CRAZY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
