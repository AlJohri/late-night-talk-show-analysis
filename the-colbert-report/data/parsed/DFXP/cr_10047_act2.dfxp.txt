WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS, YOU KNOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE MADE THIS CLEAR SINCE DAY ONE OF THIS SHOW I AM ABSOLUTELY NO FAN OF THE FRENCH. SURE THEY GAVE US THE STATUE OF LIBERTY BUT BIG DEAL, WE ALREADY HAD ONE IN VEGAS. BUT THE RECENT BEHAVIOR OF THEIR PRESIDENT FRANCOISE HOLLANDE HAS SACRE BLOWN MY MIND. SO TONIGHT HE IS MY ALPHA DOG OF THE WEEK. OR TECHNICALLY HE IS MY CHIEN ALPHA DE LA SEMAINE
LE WOOF.
NATION, I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T TOP SILVIO BERLUSCONI'S BUNGA BUNGA PARTIES BUT HOLLANDE HAS DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE, HE HAS TAKEN IT TO A THIRD BUNGA. JIM? THE SEX SCANDAL SWIRLING AROUND THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE.
THE PRESIDENT IS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH AN ACTRESS.
THAT'S RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT WAS CAUGHT CREME BRULEE-ING ANOTHER WOMAN AND IT'S NOT EVEN THE FIRST TIME. FOR OVER 30 YEARS FRANK HERE WAS BUTTERING HIS BAGUETTE WITH FELLOW SOCIALIST POLITICIAN SEGOLENE ROYAL, BONJOUR MADAME. [LAUGHTER] THEY WERE FRANCE'S ULTIMATE POWER COUPLE LIKE BILL AND HILLARY ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS SOCIALIST. NOW DESPITE THEIR HAVING FOUR CHILDREN TOGETHER, THEY NEVER GOT MARRIED. HOLLANDE CLEARLY CAN'T  COMMIT, NOT EVEN TO WHAT  COUNTRY HE'S NAMED AFTER. BUT -- FOLKS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NAPOLEON BONER-PARTS DID NOT STOP THERE. IN 2007 AFTER ROYAL LOST THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HE STARTED SNIFFING AROUND FOR SOME ETRANGER: JOURNALIST VALERIE  TRIERWEILER. OH, MAIS OUI, WHO AFTER HOLLANDE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT BECAME FRANCE'S FIRST LADY EVEN THOUGH AGAIN THEY WERE NEVER MARRIED. APPARENTLY THE FIRST LADY OF FRANCE IS JUST THE LAST PERSON THE PRESIDENT SLEPT WITH. NOW TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE, FOR A FEW MONTHS IN 1998 OUR FIRST LADY WOULD HAVE BEEN MONICA LEWINSKY. NOW-- NOW. SOME LEWINSKY FANS HERE TONIGHT. ALL RIGHT, NOW SOME MUTTS WOULD BE SATISFIED WITH MAKING THE PUBLIC ACCEPT ONE MISTRESS BUT LAST WEEK IT WAS REVEALED THAT HOLLANDE IS DEPAR- DOING IT WITH FRENCH FILM ACTRESS JULIE GAYET. OU EST LA BIBLIOTEQUE. AND REMEMBER, FOLKS, HOLLANDE LOOKS LIKE HE COULD BE RINGING BELLS AT NOTRE DAME. NOW-- THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE LIVES IN A PALACE SURROUNDED BY SECURITY. BUT THIS PUPPY LE PEW FOUND THE DOGGIE DOOR.
JULIE GAYET PICTURED ARRIVING AT THE DOOR OF THIS PARIS APARTMENT, FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY A HELMETED MAN ON THE BACK OF A MOTOR SCOOTER. THE FRENCH PRESIDENT IN A FEEBLE DISGUISE IDENTIFIED BY HIS SHOES.
SEVERAL MEDIA OUTLETS ARE REPORTING THE APARTMENT WHERE HOLLANDE SUPOSEDLY SPENT TIME WITH HIS MISTRESS IS LINKED TO THE MAFIA.
Stephen: OH, YOU NOT WANT TO MIX WITH THE FRENCH MAFIA. OH, THEY WILL SILENCE YOU FOREVER IN AN INVISIBLE BOX. [LAUGHTER] BUT FOLKS, FOLKS, THIS CHIEN DE FA BRUSHED OFF THE CONCERN ASSURING THE PUBLIC HE WAS ALWAYS SAFE.
MY SECURITY IS GUARANTEED EVERYWHERE AND AT ALL TIMES. WHEN IT'S PRIVATE IT'S A LIGHTER PROTECTION BUT EVERYWHERE I'M PROTECTED.
Stephen: SEE, HE HAD PLENTY OF PROTECTION.
NEW REPORTS SAYS MISTRESS OF THE FRENCH PRESIDENT IS PREGNANT.
Stephen: OKAY, MAYBE A LITTLE MORE PROTECTION WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE. NOW--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW REMEMBER REMEMBER HE STILL HASN'T BROKEN UP WITH THE FIRST MISTRESS HERE WHO I GOT TO SAY IS NOT TAKING THIS WELL.
HIS LONG-TERM PARTNER FRANCE'S FIRST LADY VALERIE IN HOSPITAL SAID TO BE SUFFERING LE BLUES. WHAT THE FRENCH CALL A "CURE DU SOMMEIL," OR SLEEP CURE, IN WHICH SHE'S KEPT SEDATED UNTIL SHE FEELS BETTER.
Stephen: YES. JUST KEPT SEDATED UNTIL SHE FEELS BETTER. OR UNTIL THE LEECHES BALANCE HER HUMORS. THERE IS YOUR SOCIALIZED MEDICINE, FOLKS. ALL OF THIS HAS COMPROMISED HOLLANDE'S TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES.
TODAY FRANCOIS HOLLANDE SIDESTEPPED A SIMPLE QUESTION, WHO IS THE FIRST LADY.
PRESIDENT HOLLAND PROMISED HIS LOVE LIFE WOULD BE SORTED OUT BY THE TIME HE VISITS WASHINGTON. WHICH GIVES HIM LESS THAN A MONTH TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE HIS FIRST LADY AT FEBRUARY'S WHITE HOUSE STATE DINNER.
OH, YOU KNOW, HE SHOULD JUST MAKE IT LIKE THE BACHELOR, HAVE A ROSE CEREMONY IN THE WHITE HOUSE ROSE GARDEN, WILL IT BE THE CURRENT FIRST LADY, HIS NEW SECOND FIRST LADY OR MORE LIKELY, WILL THIS ALPHA DOG GET DRY HUMPING BO? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SO FRANCOIS HOLLANDE FOR BEING THE BEST IN BREEDER,  YOU, SIR, ARE MY CHIEN ALPHA DE LA SEMAINE  YOU, SIR, ARE MY CHIEN ALPHA DE LA SEMAINE  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
