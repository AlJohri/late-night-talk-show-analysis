The resources needed for terrorism are very modest, and the group would have to suffer even heavier losses on territory, manpower and money for its terrorist capacity to decline significantly.\nMr. Brennan is absolutely correct in his assessment ... Mr. Obama is far too short-sighted on ISIS.\nAgain ... that is the truth, but the truth will not be accepted by Obama devotees.\nSame thing with Hillary.\nSame thing with Trump.\nProve all of them wrong, and they are at times, and you will be attacked as a false messenger.
