His story is fascinating. Mr. Ramirez Medina came here at age seven, the son of an illegal alien criminal named Antonio Ramirez-Polendo. There he is. Ramirez-Polendo spent a year in a Washington State prison for felony drug trafficking. He was a dealer.\nIn the I.C.E. raid, he was picked up along with his son, but get this. Ramirez-Polendo has been deported eight times. Yet, still was residing outside of Seattle. Would you want someone in your neighborhood deported eight times? We have not heard one, not one, liberal voice commenting on that. Instead, they are focusing on Daniel.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: In another assault on our values, in the past week, we have witnessed I.C.E. raids across our nation, targeting parents, students, and DACA protected dreamers.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: The protection Congresswoman Pelosi is talking about was mandated by President Obama. It is called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA. Essentially, the order says that children brought to America by illegal alien parents and to have no criminal history should be allowed to stay and work here. Daniel Ramirez Medina was part of that program. The problem is the Department of Homeland Security now says, he is admitted to having gang affiliations. His attorney denies that.\nBut he has a tattoo on his forearm which some people believe signifies gang membership. The Factor is trying to confirm that but so far, we have not been able to do so. It might just be a tattoo with no implications. Now, that gang allegation was enough for I.C.E. to hold Daniel, who has a three- year-old son in this country. But the Left has now taken the case and made it a centerpiece of attacks on President Trump's crackdown on criminal illegal aliens. But the anti-Trump crew totally ignores the father! And the sun was in the father's home! Indicating the left doesn't care at all if a foreign national is deported eight times and is still here.\nRemember, the alleged murder of Kate Steinle was deported five times in San Francisco County, still protected him, right up until the time the man was arrested and accused of shooting Kate to death. So, step back for a moment. One part of the country, led by President Trump, wants to deport criminal illegal aliens and secure the borders, so, they can't get back in here. Another part of the country doesn't want strict border enforcement and doesn't seem to care that criminals can defy deportation as many as eight times!\nSo, what side are you on? One final thing. Every time, and I mean every time, the subject of criminal illegal aliens arises, the Democratic Party will not engage. Instead, they fall back on the ruse that the illegal immigration crackdown is aimed at chambermaids and house painters. Do you hear that over and over and over. In the case of Daniel Ramirez-Medina, there is certainly enough in play to investigate him further. Is there not?\nIn the case of his father, who again was deported eight times, if Kate's Law were passed, he'd be serving decades in a federal penitentiary. And that is \"The Memo.\"", "video_clips": ["REP.
