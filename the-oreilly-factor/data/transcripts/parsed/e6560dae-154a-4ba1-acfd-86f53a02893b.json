TOM FRIEDEN, CDC DIRECTOR: We really need to be clear that we don't inadvertently increase the risk to people in this country by making it harder for us to respond to the needs in those countries by making it harder for us to get assistance in.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Total garbage. We have asked Dr. Frieden a number of times to appear on \u2018The Factor\u2019. He will not because he is afraid. He knows that I know he's not being candid, that he is spinning the situation and not being forthcoming about how the disease is being spread. Frieden should resign. As he well knows, charter flights could carry medical and military personnel to the affected areas in Africa and that's the way they should be transported, by charter. So that monitoring can be very close.\nBelieving that civilian airport people in JFK or Newark or Dulles airport can spot Ebola that is dormant, believing that is stupid and irresponsible and puts all Americans at risk. It's a dumb and dangerous ruse and Frieden is the chief propagandist. He knows better.\n\"Talking Points\" is just asking for common sense which the Obama administration is rejecting outright. But I will predict tonight they will soon reverse course. Again, there is no compelling reason for West Africans to come to the United States at this point in time.\nSecondly on Ebola, we're simply not being told the truth. How did the NBC News cameraman contract the disease? Ashoka Mukpo is being treated right now in Nebraska and we still don't know how he got it in Africa. Americans have a right to know that. And the failure to tell us is a huge concern this has to stop. The federal government has to level with the American people.\nNow, on to the ISIS terror threat. Reports out of Syria and Iraq say U.S. bombing is doing some damage to these terrorists but is not stopping their advance. All of us who see things clearly knew that was going to be the case.\nAnd I believe President Obama also knew that was going to be the case but wouldn't tell the American people. Instead, the President has created a myth that somehow a 60-nation coalition that is basically doing nothing is going to defeat ISIS. I mean, the Turkish army, part of the coalition, is one mile away from the terrorists watching them slaughter civilians. And the Turkish army is doing nothing. Great coalition, Mr. President -- way to go.\nSumming up, the American people are not being told the whole truth by the Obama administration about two very important situations and the B.S. has to stop.
