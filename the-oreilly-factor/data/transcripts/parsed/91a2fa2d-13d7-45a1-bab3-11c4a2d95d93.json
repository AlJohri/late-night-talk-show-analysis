She was in Syria to help suffering refugees.\nPresident Obama said, quote, \"The United States will find and bring to justice the terrorists who are responsible for Kayla's captivity and death.

As Talking Points has mentioned President Obama has received advice about terrorism from two former defense secretaries -- advice he has rejected.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nROBERT GATES, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: The reality is they are not going to be able to be successful against ISIS strictly from the air or strictly depending on the Iraqi forces or the Peshmerga of the Sunni tribes acting on their.

And the war in Iraq should not impede effective strategy against Muslim killers today. To allow the jihad to continue its reign of terror without a solid plan strikes me as irresponsible and dangerous.\nLast night I talked with David Axelrod, one of Mr. Obama's closest advisers.
