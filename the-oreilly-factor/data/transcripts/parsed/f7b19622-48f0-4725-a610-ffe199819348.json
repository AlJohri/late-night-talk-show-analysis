The issue seems to be quote, \"racial insensitivity\", unquote. As \"Talking Points\" has put forth for years there are human beings who are bigoted -- always been, always will be.\nIgnorant people verbally attack blacks, Jews, Muslims -- pretty much every minority group in America and on the planet. But there is nothing society can do about individual hateful behavior unless that behavior becomes threatening to other people.\nAfter demonstrations erupted on the campus of the University of Missouri, a 19-year-old student Hunter Park was arrested for making threats on social media. Parker -- Park, I should say -- allegedly considered shooting blacks. So now he is in the criminal justice system where he should be.\nThat's the way things are supposed to work. If you are a threat to another person, you must be sanctioned. But \"Talking Points\" believes the mania at Mizzou, Yale, Ithaca College and other places is politically driven and mostly a ruse.\nToday there was supposed to be a mass walkout of college students dubbed the \"Million-Student March\" organized by far left concerns who are demanding tuition-free public colleges, cancellation of all student debt and a $15-an-hour minimum wage for campus workers, among other things.\nAs Monica Crowley pointed out here last night much of this stuff is being driven by organized far left fanatics.\nLet's take a look at Yale. Problem here arose after some Yale officials sent out a memo suggesting that students not wear racially- insensitive Halloween costumes.\nSo what's that? Well, the University of Louisville wearing a Mexican sombrero on Halloween is racially insensitive.\nSo I guess the next time I see somebody wearing an Erin Islands (ph) sweater I can say that's racially insensitive to the Irish. Sombreros are worn in Mexico just as sweaters are worn in Ireland. So you can see how utterly ridiculous the whole thing is.\nNow after the Yale pinheads directed their brilliant students on Halloween some of the smarter Yale faculty said you know what? This might not be such a good idea this Halloween memo. We do have freedom of expression in America. Bingo they're racially-insensitive. They're bigots. They should be fired.\nThat's what the whole Yale thing is about.\nAt the University of Missouri it's a bit more complex. There was a report of a swastika being put on a dormitory wall -- that's unacceptable and illegal. Another report says a drunk student said inappropriate racial things. He has been suspended. But again, individual conduct does not reflect university policy.\nListen to this Mizzou student.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He has to acknowledge that our college campuses, they were built off of, you know, the backs of people of color. When we look at how institutions were built, largely plantation owners and slave owners were sending money and children to these institutions.\nSo it's built within the fabrics of our community and we need to break down and discuss how this is happening on campus and how racism still lives here.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: So, that's what this is all about, racial grievance. But the words \"racial insensitivity\" are being used as the hammer. Think about it.\nIf I'm a college kid and I ask another student to turn down rap music I could be racially insensitive. If I object on religious grounds to gay marriage, I can be accused of being a homophobe. If I imitate Ricky Ricardo from \"I Love Lucy\" `splaining by using his accent I could be labeled a bigot. This is dangerous. And the witch hunters are running wild.\nSadly few college administrators have the courage to confront them.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He has to acknowledge that our college campuses, they were built off of, you know, the backs of people of color.
