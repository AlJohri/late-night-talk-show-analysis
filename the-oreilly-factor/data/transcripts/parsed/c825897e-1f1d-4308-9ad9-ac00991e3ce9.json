I know you pay attention to this kind of stuff.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Absolutely.\nO'REILLY: You know, when I saw these 10-year-old girls, I don't think they should be doing that.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Well, I 100 percent understand. I'm about 60 percent against it about 40 percent for the effort. I think the effort is good. Speaking out, speaking your mind and being involved in politics.\nO'REILLY: But they can't possibly understand the nuances of the story.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Absolutely. I think with the Black Panther Party I kind of overheard that. And I think it started out promoting, you know, community, and then it went wrong somewhere.\nO'REILLY: Right. It got a little --\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Yes. You have four children, right?\nO'REILLY: Right.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Yes. Four children.\nO'REILLY: Now, they must be paying attention to all this racial business.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Absolutely.\nO'REILLY: What do you tell them?\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Well, I make sure my kids understand people. Understand that if somebody is racist. It came from somewhere. They didn't just -- they wasn't born racist. Somebody is a gang member. They weren't born a gang member. So, I want to make sure my children understand the environment that they live in.\nO'REILLY: Okay. So, do you tell them as the mayor of New York City did, to watch out for the police?\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: No, I just tell them not all police are bad. I grew up in environment where police weren't around a lot. And I experienced some profile and I experienced good police. I remember growing up playing basketball. Police actually took off their guns, put it on the ground and played basketball.\nO'REILLY: Right, in Queens?\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: In Queens. Which is like you never do that, right? So, I explained both sides. And I understand, you know, what everybody is going through right now.\nO'REILLY: Now, when you wrote this meet the police, what's the message of this book?\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: The message is you don't want to start racial wars or things like that. You want to have solutions. You want to have prevention, tactics and things like that. And you also want to address issues. You just don't want to just push it under the rug.\nO'REILLY: It's written for children?\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: It's written for children absolutely.\nO'REILLY: Right.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Because you don't want children to grow up hating police or race hating. Hating another race, black hating whites, whites hating blacks. That's why my book is very diverse.\nO'REILLY: Okay. When you hear someone, you know, look, the Ferguson, Missouri, thing, it was established beyond any reasonable doubt.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Right.\nO'REILLY: That the initial reporting hands up didn't happen.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Right.\nO'REILLY: Okay. Do you feel it's necessary to correct the record to people who believe it did happen?\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: I believe -- I do believe that. And I also believe that the blacks make up 70 percent of Ferguson. And we are only five percent law enforcement and nobody is involved in politics. You know? And if you really want to change a community, you have to get involved in politics. You have to get involved in the school system. You have to try to change.\nO'REILLY: Absolutely. Blacks are a majority in that town, if they wanted, they could have a black mayor or, you know, they could organize and much.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Absolutely. Organize.\nO'REILLY: And I'm more, you know, I have known you for a while because I'm an NBA fan. And your name used to it be Ron Artest.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Used to be.\nO'REILLY: Why is it now Metta World Peace?\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Well, I feel I continue to evolve, I continue to connect to people, to the earth.\nO'REILLY: To the earth?\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Everything.\nO'REILLY: Okay.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: I'm just evolving as a person.

I experienced racism in a Chinese society, in New York City when I used to grow up. You know, and people automatically judged me and assumed that I'd wanted to maybe steal something or things like that.\nO'REILLY: Right.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: But, you know what? As I get older, I don't judge. I try to come up with prevention, solutions.\nO'REILLY: And that's the good thing about you. I mean, and you guys that don't follow the NBA, he was the toughest guys, tough players. But then they go Metta World Peace beat me up.\n(LAUGHTER)\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: You know, very rough on the court.\nO'REILLY: Thanks a lot for coming on.\nMETTA WORLD PEACE: Thanks for having me.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.
