There are a number of reasons he is obviously a non-liberal candidate. He has mobilized support by mentioning ethnic groups like Mexicans and Muslims in negative ways, also he has used a variety of personal attacks against his opponents although the media is no stranger to that technique.\nHowever, the root cause of the media's disdain for Donald Trump is not his policy or behavior on the campaign trail. It's him. Who he is, a wealthy man who is not politically correct who has made enormous amount of money by selling himself in high profile ways. Mr. Trump knows the press is against him. And uses that to stoke up his supporters.\nDONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look at all those cameras zooming. They are the most dishonest people in the world.\n(CROWD BOOING)\nThe media. They are the worst. They are the worst. They are very dishonest people. They are terrible. Do we hate the media?\n(CROWD CHEERING)\nOkay. Now, I don't hate anybody. I love the media. They are wonderful. But hey, I guess we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the media. I guess we shouldn't be complaining, right?\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Yes. If that sounds like a mixed message, it is. Trump understands that many people who support him loathe the press so he takes advantage of that. But he also knows that if he wins the White House, he will make some kind of arrangement with the Press Corps thus he tempers his remarks somewhat. He was sarcastic at the end. But make no mistake, Trump knows the media will support Hillary Clinton and will denigrate him at every turn, sometimes savagely. Here in New York, the daily news a rank tabloid will do just about anything including denigrating those who vote for Donald Trump.\nPhiladelphia Daily News another down market tabloid same kind of situation. There are no limits for those people. But the network news and cable operations like CNN will be a bit more measured knowing they will lose audience if they attack Trump outright. In the end, Donald Trump will not, will not get a fair shake from the press. As the campaign against Hillary Clinton unfolds, things will become brutal and the press will try to rattle Mr. Trump. They see him as personally unworthy, beneath them, and destructive to their ideology. Mr. Trump needs to begin preparing himself for the onslaught.
