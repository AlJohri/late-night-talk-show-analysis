A new NBC News poll asked, do you think things in the nation are generally headed in the right or wrong direction? A whopping 62 percent said wrong direction; only 30 percent believe the U.S. is headed in the right direction; 5 percent are mixed up or something. Now, I believe the poll is accurate because the economy is soft, earnings are stagnant. Foreign policy is the worst I have ever seen ever.\nBut in the same poll, Vice President Biden was matched up against all the Republican contenders for president and Biden wins each time. The Vice President 48 percent, Jeb Bush 40 percent. Biden 47 percent, Carly Fiorina 41 percent. Biden 49 percent, Dr. Carson 41. Biden 56, Donald Trump 35. The veep isn't even running yet but he soon will be and this poll may nudge him.\nBut how can these results happen when two-thirds of the country believes the country is in trouble? Biden is the Vice President. He endorses pretty much everything Barack Obama does. So why would you vote for him?\nTalking Points believes the answer to that question is kind of cruel. Many Americans are simply dumb. They don't know what's going on. They don't pay attention. They don't care. No question the machines have allowed the individual American to create his or her own world. You don't have to live in the real world anymore.\nUsed to be drugs and alcohol obliterated reality. Now it's your hand held device or your PC. That's why we do the \"Watters World\" segments. We go around the country asking simple questions, many Americans have no clue, can't answer.\nIs there any other explanation for Vice President Joseph Biden, again an acolyte of President Obama, defeating the Republican challengers? About 20 percent of the country will vote for a Democratic no matter who it is. I mean Miley Cyrus could be running and they would pull the lever for her.\nSame thing on the conservative side. About 20 percent will always vote Republican. But that leaves 60 percent who could be persuaded. However, if you don't know anything and don't pay attention to current events, no matter what kind of facts are presented, you can't process them. And I believe that's what's happening in the U.S.A. right now. As always, I could be wrong.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "Stay with me here because this is amazing.
