When the Pentagon is surprised by the most dangerous terrorist organization on the planet, something's very wrong. But this has been going on for quite some time.

Only 90 rebels have taken part so far.

And once again, it puts us all in danger.\nNow let's turn to the decline of American power at home. According to the Census Bureau in 2012, the most recent stats, almost 110 million Americans lived in a home receiving government assistance, apart from Social Security and Medicare, which is earned. That's about a third of the population and a historically high number including the great depression.\nWhen citizens become dependent on government to live day to day, that weakens the entire nation. Prosperity is a key component to a strong country. But prosperity in the U.S.A. is on the decline. As median income has fallen more than 3 percent under President Obama. Wages are the key to personal independence. And wages are not increasing.\nRemember, America was built on hard work, not government safety nets. There was no welfare or government assistance when this country was founded. You either made it or you didn't.\nToday many of us have a sense of entitlement, that's eroding our well- being. Millions of Americans now depend on elected officials for their security. That leads to vote buying and corruption. Being self-sufficient makes you stronger. Being dependent makes you weaker.\nThe welfare state that liberal America champions has brought power to the Democratic Party, no doubt but it's also created massive debt and sapped personal initiative. In just a few moments, Jesse Watters will talk to some Americans who are just hanging around all day, doing little with their lives.\nBottom line, Americans' foreign policy weak; America's domestic policy heading in the wrong direction very quickly.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For all the contingency planning that you routinely do here at the Pentagon, were there plans for how to react to the fall of Mosul to ISIS?DEMPSEY: Well, no.
