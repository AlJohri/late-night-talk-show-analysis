Mr. Axelrod knowing his book would get notice if he came on this broadcast. I told him sure. We would have a lively respectful discussion, which we did on February 9th.\nThen, to show his gratitude, Axelrod begins trashing Fox News, saying we are not a real news organization. That was a mistake. Being two-faced, not a legacy builder, Dave. Perhaps he just made a verbal mistake, if so, we are ready to accept Mr. Axelrod's apology.\nThe fact is that Fox News is now a deep threat to the progressive movement and the far left despises us. So they are in full attack mode, desperately trying to marginalize FNC.\nEnter Hillary Clinton who wants to be president. Her election team knew the \"New York Times\" was sniffing around the e-mail story. Ever since last August there were whispers in Washington that the former secretary of state had endangered national security by using a private e-mail system based in her New York home. Reports say some in the White House were also aware of the situation.\nOn February 13th, this man John Podesta, long time political mercenary left his job advising President Obama to begin working for Hillary Clinton. He brought with him a history of associations including one with the Media Matters organization, the chief attack vehicle for the left.\nMedia Matters run by a man named David Brock and heavily funded by George Soros. Brock used to smear folks on the left but then he converted to viciously attack folks on the right -- quite a guy -- who has admitted lying about people in the past.\nWhen the e-mail story broke on Hillary Clinton it was Brock who immediately went on MSNBC to proclaim her innocence. Few heard him. The Clinton campaign and John Podesta will understand there are just two national news agencies that challenged the progressive agenda with authority: the \"Wall Street Journal editor page and the Fox News channel.

MSNBC and CNN are getting hammered economically by Fox News so those agencies are hungry to participate in the attack process.
