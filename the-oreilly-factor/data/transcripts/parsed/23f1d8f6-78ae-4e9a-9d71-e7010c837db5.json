Surely, that NCIS report was known by President Obama before he approved the release of five top Taliban terrorists from Guantanamo Bay. But even worse, were the public statements made as the time of Bergdahl's release.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sergeant Bergdahl has missed birthdays and holidays, and the simple moments with family and friends which all of us take for granted. But while Bowe was gone he was never forgotten.\nJAY CARNEY, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Sergeant Bergdahl put on the uniform of the United States, voluntarily -- that takes honor and it is a mark of distinction.\nSUSAN RICE, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: He is going to be safely reunited with his family. He served the United States with honor and distinction.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Talking Points is appalled that a man who may have collaborated with the enemy in Afghanistan was erroneously defined by the White House. That's deception because the investigation indicated criminal activity and none of that was presented to we, the people, none of it. Quite the opposite we were told Sergeant Bergdahl was and is a man of honor.\nBut now the military has charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy which could lead to life in prison for the sergeant. This entire Bergdahl ruse is part of the reason many, perhaps most Americans no longer trust President Obama.\nIf we are going to be misled to that degree on Bergdahl, what about Iran? What about the war on terror? What about the economy? Benghazi was bad enough. The White House describing the attack as inspired by an anti- Muslim video, but at least that was issued shortly after the fog of the battle. Bergdahl's situation was known for years.
