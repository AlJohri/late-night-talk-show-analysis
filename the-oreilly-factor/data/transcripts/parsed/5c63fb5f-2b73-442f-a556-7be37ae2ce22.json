Topics of conversation range from economics to terrorism. By the way, it used to be the G-8 but Russia got booted out because of Putin the invader.\nAnyway, earlier today Mr. Obama said something that is not only frightening but incredibly disturbing. He was asked about ISIS and why the U.S.A. does not have a strategy to stop the brutal jihadists.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nOBAMA: When a finalized plan is presented to me by the Pentagon, then I will share it with the American people. It's not -- we don't yet have a complete strategy because it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis as well. The details of that are not yet worked out.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: So after nearly two years the U.S.A. still does not have a plan to confront ISIS. Here is what the President said last August.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nOBAMA: We don't have a strategy yet. I think what I have seen in some of the news reports suggests that folks are getting a little further ahead of where we are at than we currently are.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: That was right after the beheading of an American citizen by ISIS.\nNow, only two possible scenarios here -- two. First, that the U.S. military is grossly incompetent and can't come up with a plan to defeat a terror group comprised of about 30,000 individuals. Or two that the President of the United States lacks the will to defeat an enemy that threatens every American.\nTalking Points is throwing in with option number 2. Mr. Obama simply does not see the urgency. It does not have the fire to take on terrorists who are slaughtering thousands of innocent people. That's the truth. And, sadly, millions of Americans are willing to accept that fact and still support the President.\nIf every American demanded the U.S.A. become proactive once again in defeating the jihad, then it would happen. But many of us are apathetic as long. As the mass murder is overseas, we don't care. Of course it won't be long until the murder comes here because that's the stated goal of ISIS.\nOn another front the Chinese government has been accused of hacking into Web sites of the U.S. federal government. Apparently more than four million Americans have had their personal data stolen by the Chinese. Today President Obama was asked about that.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nOBAMA: We haven't publicly unveiled who we think may have engaged in these cyber-attacks, but I can tell you that we have known for a long time that there are significant vulnerabilities and that these vulnerabilities are going to accelerate as time goes by.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: So what are you going to do about it, Mr. President? I guess in a couple of years he might come up with a strategy.\nI think everybody is getting the picture here. We have a leader who doesn't want to lead. Barack Obama is interested in the theoretical dilemma of climate change. He is interested in social justice, in redistributing American wealth. Not much interested in blatant attacks on America's security and mass murder around the world. It appears to me that Barack Obama is not going to change.\nSo this country is now in a race to see if we can avoid catastrophe in the next 18 months. A very dangerous game.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["OBAMA: When a finalized plan is presented to me by the Pentagon, then I will share it with the American people.
