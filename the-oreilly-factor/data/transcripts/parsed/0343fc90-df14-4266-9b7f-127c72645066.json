There is bad blood between Turkey, a member of NATO and Russia over the Syrian tyrant Assad. Turkey wants him out.

With ISIS launching terror attacks directed from Syria and Russia now destroying American-supported assets on the ground. A world war while not probable is not inconceivable.\nToday, President Obama met with French President Hollande in Washington for some tough talk about the ISIS terror attack in Paris.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nOBAMA: It is a scourge that threatens all of us.

But to put together that kind of a strategy requires leadership and muscle.\nThe French president who wants the action doesn't have enough juice to do it alone and President Obama is M.I.A. on the NATO issue.\nSo here's what's likely to happen.
