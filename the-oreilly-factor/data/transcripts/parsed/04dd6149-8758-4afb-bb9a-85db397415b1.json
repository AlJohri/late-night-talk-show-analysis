Many on the left simply do not want immigration law to be enforced. The cold truth is they want anarchy. They believe that everyone has a right to come to America for whatever reason. Some of these peopled advocate open borders with no restrictions on traveling to the U.S.A.\nSome of them believe that the poor must be accommodated in every way. And some people who support illegal immigration do so for political reasons. Logic dictates that if America's immigration laws are unfair, Congress should change them, right? But right now Talking Points believes what we have is pretty reasonable. The laws we have. You apply to come to the U.S.A., and your application is either accepted or rejected.\nIf you simply show up with no papers, you're violating U.S. law. Yet Governor Jerry Brown of California, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado just to name a few say they will not obey immigration law. That, of course, is a violation of their sworn oath to uphold the laws of the United States. You don't get to pick and choose.\nSo, there really isn't any legal argument here. It's all about theory and politics. President Trump campaigned on ending the illegal alien madness. So let's take a look at what he wants to do. Right now there are 654 miles of fencing along the Southern border of Mexico. That leaves 1300 miles of border without a barrier. Mr. Trump is going to expand the fencing and rename it a wall. It will not be constant.\nThere are areas that don't need barriers because natural barriers prevent crossings. The primary reason a wall is needed is that tons of narcotics are being smuggled from Mexico into the U.S.A. That's a scandal. And Mexico will not stop it, blaming the U.S. for drug consumption. But it's clear that Mexico is a passive partner in the drug and people smuggling industries.\nTherefore, that country should pay for at least part of the wall. I mean, here's how bad it is. The Mexican drug lord, El Chapo, is here in New York City right now because the Mexican government cannot put him on trial. He escaped twice from Mexican prisons. The most notorious criminal in the country escaped twice. The sad truth is Mexico is corrupt and cannot stop the drug cartels from doing their evil business and will not stop, will not stop millions of migrants from crossing its territory and entering into the U.S.A. illegally.\nAgain, that is Mexico's fault. So if a barrier stops some of the drugs, why would anyone object to that? And today President Trump suggested Mexico may have to pay a 20 percent tariff to fund the wall. This is all way too much for the Mexican president. He canceled the meeting next week with President Trump, who addressed the issue this afternoon.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: The President of Mexico and myself have agreed to cancel our planned meeting scheduled for next week. Unless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless and I want to go a different route.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, it really doesn't matter who canceled what. What does matter is that last year 560 pounds of heroin will confiscated at the Mexican border. Five hundred sixty pounds. That's just a fraction of the heroin that got through. As you may know, 50,000 people died in 2015 from drug overdoses in the U.S.A. By the way, more than 8,000 pounds of methamphetamine were confiscated at the border but most, again, got through.\nSo if you object to a wall, designed to prevent drugs from being smuggled in here, what is your rationale? Now, onto the sanctuary cities. It's clear President Trump is not ready to deport illegal aliens who do not commit crimes in the U.S.A. Said that again yesterday. It is the criminal aliens that are being targeted by Homeland Security. Left wing politicians know that, but lie about it.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nMAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK CITY: New York City has half a million undocumented people. We want them to come forward and work with the police if they see a crime if they are a victim of crime. If they believe by talking to a police officer they will get deported and be torn apart from their family, they are not going to work with police.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: That's not the issue. Mayor De Blasio an uber leftist completely avoids the criminal alien subject always trying to deflect the sanctuary city situation on to house painters and chamber maids. So dishonest. In Chicago, where the mayor cannot control gang violence, he remains defiant on criminal aliens.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nMAYOR RAHM EMANUEL (D), CHICAGO: We're going to stay a sanctuary city. There is no stranger among us. We welcome people, whether you are from Poland or Pakistan, whether you're from Ireland or India or Israel, and whether you're from Mexico or Moldavia where my grandfather came from, you are welcome in Chicago as you pursue the American dream.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: So you're welcome in Chicago even if you are a criminal alien, a felon. You're welcome in the windy city because sanctuary cities do not flag undocumented criminals for federal authorities. They refuse to do that. That's the crux of the matter that irresponsible politicians like De Blasio and Emanuel put their own people at risk for political gain. Neither man would be in office without pandering to the people who have recently come to this country. And who may not understand the danger of sanctuary cities. It is political demagoguing at its worse, but it has some support.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are xenophobic. You are homophobic. You are pitting Americans against Americans. And fair minded smart Americans are not going to stand by passively and let you pit us against one another.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: You being President Trump. This week there were demonstrations in places like New York City, Washington, San Francisco, Denver protesting against President Trump's executive orders. But, again, exactly what are these people objecting to, trying to stop narcotics from coming in here? Trying to get a handle on illegal aliens who commit crimes? Are they objecting to that, really? Part of Mr. Trump's executive action orders Homeland Security to make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens on a weekly basis.\nAlso to list jurisdictions that failed to honor federal detainers with respect to undocumented criminal aliens. Trump administration wants you, the folks, to know the full extent of the problem. Finally, the government accountability office, an independent nonpartisan agency that works for Congress says that in the year 2015, 22,000 high risk air travelers were prevented from coming to the U.S.A. In that same year, more than 8,000 known or suspected terrorists tried to get in here but were thwarted.\nSo if protesters and these loony mayors think that open borders and lax immigration enforcement are good things, they're idiots. And deserve to be scorned. Breaking it down, sanctuary cities and counties promote anarchy. If the left doesn't like immigration law, petition Congress to change it. If the mayors refuse to obey federal law, President Trump should cut off federal funds immediately.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": ["TRUMP: The President of Mexico and myself have agreed to cancel our planned meeting scheduled for next week.
