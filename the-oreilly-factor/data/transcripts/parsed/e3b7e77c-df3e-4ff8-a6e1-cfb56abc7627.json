Millions of Americans are fed up with intellectually dishonest politicians were not looking up for them. Mr. Trump portrayed the nation's capital as a swamp.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we all are about to say. When we win tomorrow, we are going to drain the swamp!\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: But for every action, there is a reaction and a law of unintended consequences is now hitting President Trump. As because the swamp is inhabited by many different creatures, some of whom want to destroy the President. Right now, the national media despises Mr. Trump, as we pointed out, and backed up with facts. Also, some folks working for the federal government want to damage the President. That is what you are seeing the leaks from intelligence agencies and other federal bureaucracies.\nNow, all presidents have to deal with leaks. But in this political climate, the press gleefully, gleefully accepts information from anonymous sources and spends it negative against Trump. As we pointed out last night, the public and press doesn't know what General Michael Flynn said to the Russian ambassador. We will know but we don't now. Also, there are semi-truth to allegations that people working on the Trump campaign had meaningful contact with the Russia government, but we don't know. Yet, the press is running wild with the stories and the Trump haters are relishing a witch hunts.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nAL SHARPTON, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: If there were dialogues and negotiations with the Russians, with the Russians, which is clearly against the law, and clearly an act that cannot be pardoned, if the President knew what was going on, and it did not stop it, or in some way authorize it, that can be impeachable.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: That is his bull. Not against the law for anyone to talk with any Russians. General Flynn had no power being a private citizen, when the call with the Russian ambassador to took place. In order for him to commit a crime, he would fire to formally attempt to undermine the Obama administrations Russian policy. Al Sharpton is full of it, as always.\nNow, there is a report today that says General Flynn may have lied to the FBI. And we've mentioned that. If it is true, that is a crime. So, we'll see. As \"Talking Points\" reported last night, there are two goals here. First, to leak the Trump campaign to the Russian hackers, who disrupted the Clinton campaign. And the second, to try to prove that President-elect Trump was undermining President Obama on the Russian policy back in December. That is what the media goal is, that is what they want.\nAlso, as we said last night, if there is truth to those allegations, they should be taken very seriously, when the facts are presented. When President Trump first mention draining the swamp in Washington, I don't believe he understood how extensive the problem really is. And for eight years of President Obama, there are many people working in the federal government who liked the former president and who despised Mr. Trump.\nEliminating all of them, and stopping the leaks, pretty much be impossible. Also trying to get fairness out of the anti-Trump press is impossible, as well.
