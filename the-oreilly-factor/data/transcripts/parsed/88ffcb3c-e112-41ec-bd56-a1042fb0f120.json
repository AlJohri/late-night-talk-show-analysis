DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA): \u201cJudge Gorsuch has also stated that he believes judges should look to the original public meaning of the Constitution when they decide what a provision of the Constitution means.

They are not.\nSo everybody knows politics, not the law, is involved here.\nAnd eventually, the president will win in federal court.\nBut the activist judges don't care. They have temporarily blocked the order and are liberal heroes.\nAs for Judge Gorsuch, it looks like he's a traditional man who believes the intent of the Constitution should reign.\nAgain, that seems to be unacceptable to Senator Feinstein and others. They want a political judge. They want a liberal judge.\nFinally, the best example of constitutional debate is the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms.\nIt is clear that the Founding Fathers wanted Americans to have the ability to protect themselves.\nBack then, militias were the mechanism - private citizens with guns organizing against threats.\nToday, the threats are more personal - terrorists and criminals, not frontier marauders.\nAmericans have a constitutional right to defend themselves against those who would harm them.\nThat's why firearms cannot be banned.\nBut they can be limited. You can't have a bazooka or a hand grenade.\nThat's reasonable. Public safety is involved and individual states have the right to mandate gun laws based upon the wishes of their people.\nBut the left rejects that and in some cases wants to ban guns outright.\nAt this point that is unconstitutional. But that could change if the Supreme Court becomes solely a political body dominated by the left.\nSumming up, intent, not evolution, should be the litmus test of constitutional law.\nAnd that's why a traditional judge like Neil Gorsuch is a vital situation.\nHe will likely sit for decades, presiding over a country in the middle of a social civil war.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "Many Americans voted for Donald Trump because they feared that a Democrat winning the White House would appoint another liberal judge to the Supreme Court.\nIn recent times, the court has often ruled on politics - not the law.\nMany Americans fear that, including this one.\nMr. Trump nominated 49-year-old Neil Gorsuch from Colorado, who has a very solid judicial record.\nHe serves on the 10th Circuit U.S Court of Appeals in Denver.\nToday, there were hearings in the Senate because that body must approve Judge Gorsuch to the nation's highest court.
