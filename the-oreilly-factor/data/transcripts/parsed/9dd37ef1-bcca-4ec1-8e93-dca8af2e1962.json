He was given a standing ovation by the GOP loyalists in the crowd. At first, the Senator's speech was standard issue that the country needs to be revitalized and Democratic Party is the devil. But by the end of the speech, the Republican faithful were wanting an endorsement but it didn't come.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTED CRUZ (R), TEXAS SENATOR: If you love our country, and love your children as much as I know that you do, stand and speak and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution.\n(CROWD CHANTING \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"! \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"! \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"! \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"!)\nI appreciate the enthusiasm of the New York delegation.\nO'REILLY: So the chant was endorse Trump. And to make matters worse, Trump, himself, enters the convention hall while Cruz is still speaking on stage. Completely stealing the spotlight. All the cameras went from Cruz to Trump. So, it didn't take long for the controversy to get white hot.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tonight is the Ted Cruz that I have known unfortunately. He cannot be trusted and he is not a true Republican, he is not a true conservative, he's totally self-centered. Tonight I have never seen such outrage and anger on the floor.\nCRUZ: I'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nAnd that was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Wow. Talking Points believes that Senator Cruz was wrong to deliver his speech if he was not going to outwardly support the nominee Donald Trump. In addition, Mr. Trump himself was magnanimous in allowing Cruz to have a featured spot. The Trump campaign says it knew Cruz was not going to endorse but allowed him to speak anyway. So it looks like Donald Trump's the good guy here. Remember, we did not have to give Ted Cruz 24 minutes of prime time exposure at this convention. The Trump people are in charge.\nNow, I understand the bad blood between Cruz and Trump. I understand that personal attacks. They are not easy to forget. But, you don't show up if you're not comfortable endorsing the candidate. Governor John Kasich has taken a lot of heat for not being here at the convention in Cleveland. But in his conscience, Kasich could not endorse Trump so he stayed away. Ted Cruz should have done the same thing. And that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS SENATOR: If you love our country, and love your children as much as I know that you do, stand and speak and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution.(CROWD CHANTING \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"! \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"! \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"! \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"!)I appreciate the enthusiasm of the New York delegation.O'REILLY: So the chant was endorse Trump.
