And he believes that issue is illegal immigration. So the President has decided to take unilateral action, hoping to please Hispanic-Americans and liberal thinkers.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nOBAMA: We need to make sure that the millions of people who are here, many who have been here for a decade or more, and have American kids and for all practical purposes are part of our community, that they pay a fine they pay any penalties, they learn English and they get to the back of the line and they have a capacity to legalize themselves here. Because we're not -- we don't have the capacity to deport 11 million people.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, the \"Washington Post\" reports the President may sign the executive order shortly, \"Talking Points\" would not be surprised if that comes during Thanksgiving week because that holiday is symbolized by pilgrim immigrants.\nBe that as it may the President is obviously trying to put the Republican Party on the defensive and things could get nasty. And that's the last thing America needs right now -- an immigration fight. There is no urgency that would require an executive order to be signed right now. The best thing to do for the entire country is to let the new Congress have a few weeks to design an immigration bill then if President Obama doesn't like it he can veto and do his executive action deal.\nThe American voters clearly stated they want Congress to fix the economy. Tax reform, regulation reform that kind of thing, immigration reform far down the list of priorities for most of the folks. Therefore this is a pure political play on the part of Barack Obama. He is trying to deflect attention away from his economic record and into the conservative versus liberal battle.\n\"Talking Points\" believes this is wrong -- again, not good for the country. However, I do believe some right wing hard-liners are wrong as well and objecting the fair treatment for illegal aliens. There is no question the border has to be secured before any concessions are granted.\nBut if the Republican Congress passes legislation that seals the southern border, then humane action should be taken within the U.S.A. The biggest reason for that is the U.S. government has been complicit in allowing people to cross the border illegally. From President Reagan on, Washington knew what was happening and did not stop it. That's because business makes money from illegal immigration.\nSo, with the U.S. government at fault, it should now try to right some wrongs seal the border and get some fair policies about people living here illegally.
