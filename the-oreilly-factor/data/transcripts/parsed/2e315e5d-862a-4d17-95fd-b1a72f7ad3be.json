"'The O'Reilly Factor': Bill O'Reilly's Talking Points 10/19", "date": "2016-10-20T12:21:42Z", "full_transcript": "Our pal Chris Wallace has selected six areas of questioning for the spectacle in Vegas tonight.\nSo let's run them down and analyze who has the advantage.\nFirst, debt and entitlements.\nHere both Clinton and Trump have problems.\nFor example, in order to make America great again, Trump has promised to rebuild the military, which will take a massive amount of tax money.\nBut Trump also says he'll cut taxes and that would slash money going to the federal government, at least until the economy picks up.\nThus, the debt would get bigger, at least in the short term.\nSo Donald Trump will have to be precise with his words because Wallace will surely hone in on the spending issue.\nOn the Clinton front, she pretty much supports the spending vision of President Obama, who has run up more debt than any other president in history and it's not even close.\nIn addition, Mrs. Clinton would like the feds to run the entire healthcare system. \u00a0I don't think she will say that, but certainly based on her history that's her goal.\nHaving the feds pay all the medical bills would be a colossal entitlement and debt driver.\nSo both candidates will be dancing on this one.\nSecond topic, immigration.\nTrump won the nomination largely on his tough guy approach. \u00a0He has to echo that tonight while at the same time showing some humanity. \u00a0He needs to emphasize the benefits of ending immigration chaos.\nIt will not be enough for Trump to say the Mexicans will pay for the border wall. \u00a0He may believe that, but it\u2019s now become a clich\u00e9 unless he provides specifics.\nOn the other side with the WikiLeaks hack showing Hillary Clinton dreaming of open borders, that could make the issue a tough one for her.\nOpen borders would pretty much destroy our society as tens of millions of poor people south of the border would pour in here.\nI mean wouldn't you if you were living in a Honduran shack?\nThe third issue is the Supreme Court.\nBoth candidates will be ready with names of judges the public doesn't know.\nChris Wallace will most likely ask both to cite some court decisions they feel strongly about.\nTrump better be ready for that.\nThen it's on to foreign hot spots. \u00a0It will be interesting to see how aggressive Wallace is with Clinton on that subject. \u00a0She has some problems there.\nWith the battle raging against ISIS in Mosul, Mrs. Clinton will be hard-pressed to defend President Obama removing all U.S. troops from Iraq while she was secretary of state.\nTrump, of course, has no record to defend but he should be more specific about his overseas vision, not just repeating the Iran nuke deal is bad over and over.\nThe fifth topic is the economy. \u00a0Here it's mostly B.S. \u00a0It's impossible for Americans to know who will improve the economy.\nWhat Talking Points can tell you is that Trump believes in cutting taxes to stimulate growth, much like Ronald Reagan.\nWhile Clinton believes that big government projects should create momentum in the economy.\nThis topic is endless, it just goes round and round and round.\nFinally Chris Wallace will ask about the character issue -- are you fit to run the country?\nHere things could get very nasty on both sides.\nWallace will have his hands full with that.\nAnd believe me, the headlines tomorrow will be about the character issue.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "Our pal Chris Wallace has selected six areas of
