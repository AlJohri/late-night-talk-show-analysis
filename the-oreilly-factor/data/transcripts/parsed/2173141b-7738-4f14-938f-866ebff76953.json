Information is coming in. So we will have to be nimble here. We will give you the information as we get it. But, anything can happen at any time.\nIt all began about 10:45 this morning Eastern time. Police say 24- year-old Muhammad Abdulazeez opened fire on two military recruiting stations killing four marines, wounding a female navy sailor and a police officer. The sailor is in surgery tonight.\nWitnesses report the shooter did not enter the building -- rather, he fired from outside. Dozens of shots were heard. Reports say Abdulazeez was trapped in the woods after a chase,. was killed by law enforcement. We are waiting further details on that. It's pretty murky right now. But that's the initial report.\nHere is what we know about the terrorist. He graduated from the University of Tennessee in 2012 with a degree in engineering. We believe he is an American citizen born in Kuwait -- not been confirmed yet. His father works for the city of Chattanooga. His family middle class.\nOn the victim front, we are awaiting the identities of the four murdered marines pending the notification of their families. The FBI now in charge of the investigation and the Associated Press is reporting that authorities raided the shooter's house, taking two women into custody. We are also awaiting more word on that situation. So you can see there is a lot in play.\nEarlier today, President Obama said this:\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would ask all Americans to pray for the families who are grief-stricken at this point and I want everybody to understand that we will be thorough and prompt in figuring out exactly what happened.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: In just a few moments three Fox News correspondents will report on what the investigation will entail. But there is one sensational report tonight that I have to mention even though it is not exactly clear whether it's accurate. Apparently a tweet from an ISIS-based source announced the terror action before it actually happened.\nCatherine Herridge is on that story and will join us shortly.\nIf ISIS is involved, even indirectly, all hell is going to break loose in this country. For months those savages have been encouraging people on the net to attack Americans. As you know, the Obama administration's response to the growing menace of ISIS has been long term, not an urgent campaign. Expect that to change if Muhammad Abdulazeez is linked to that terror group.\nThere have been a number of terror attacks on American soil since 9/11 as you know. The shoe bomber 2001, Fort Hood attack 2009, Boston Marathon bombing 2013 -- just to name the most infamous. But there has not been an attack by ISIS that has succeeded.\nOn a night like this when the nation faces the fact that four marines were killed on American soil -- restraint, restraint is necessary. The FBI will quickly gather the facts. And after they are presented to the public then and only then should a calculated reaction take place.\nI firmly believe President Obama is making a major mistake in the tentative nature of his response to ISIS and I have said that many times. I hope Mr. Obama's strategy will change because ISIS is a direct threat to all Americans even if it turns out they were not involved in the terror attack today.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would ask all Americans to pray for the families who are grief-stricken at this point and I want everybody to understand that we will be thorough and prompt in figuring out exactly what happened."], "remaining_transcript": "Now, throughout the evening, things are breaking.
