More lies from a crew that is incapable of telling the truth.\nAnyway, this year the American family association based in Tupelo, Mississippi, Elvis' hometown has issued its annual naughty or nice list. That tells the public which businesses are Christmas friendly and which are not. This year the following companies are rated five star nice. Cracker Barrel, Hobby Lobby, Kirkland's, Lowe's, Michael's Stores, Wal-Mart. I remember at one time Lowe's was a problem. But obviously that's turned around.\nAlso on the Christmas friendly list -- Ace Hardware, Banana Republic, Bass Pro Shops, Bed Bath and Beyond, Books-A-Million, Dick's Sporting Goods, Home Depot, J.C. Penney, Kmart, L.L. Bean, Marshalls, Neiman Marcus, Proflowers.com, Rite Aid, Sam's Club and Toys R Us.\nAgain, all those companies use the word Christmas in their advertising and promotion.

Barnes and Noble, Best Buy, Foot Locker, The Gap, The Limited, Nordstrom, Office Depot, Office Max, Petsmart, Staples and Victoria's Secret.\nAccording to the AFA, those companies are not in the Christmas spirit.

Since the war has basically been won, this is a clean-up operation. But the information is valid. Many Americans celebrates Christmas because they believe that Jesus is the savior and his birth should be honored. And because it's a federal holiday, there is no reason to diminish Christmas or insult those who believe in it. Don't like Christmas? Ignore it.\nSo, companies and stores that embrace Christmas obviously will attract folks who feel the same way.
