Twenty eight year-year-old Ahmad Rahami, US citizen who immigrated from Afghanistan. Allegedly set off a bomb that injured 29 people in Manhattan. He was captured earlier today.\nAnd 23-year-old Dahir Adan of Somali dissent allegedly stabbed nine innocent folks in the Minnesota shopping mall before being shot dead by police. All the victims there are suspected to survive.\nCouple of notes before we get into the reaction from Trump and Clinton. No one can stop these attacks by disturbed individuals who are badly damaging the Islamic faith. Young Muslim men are now looked upon with suspicion all over the world. And the crazy terrorists are the reason why. But even though individual mayhem is a fact of life, the western world is far too lenient on ISIS and other terror groups.\nWe should have devastated them a long time ago, not allowed them to hold territory and export mayhem. That policy of light confrontation has led to mass chaos in the Middle East and Europe as millions of refugees are leaving their homes because no one, no one will protect them from the horror imposed by the jihadists. Now, President Obama said again today he is staying the course.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nPRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: We will continue to lead the global coalition in the fight against ISIL which is instigating a lot of people over the internet to carry out attacks. We are going to continue to go after them. We are going to take out their leaders. We're going to take our their infrastructure and we will going to continue to enlist tech companies and community and religious leaders to push back against online extremist content and all messages of hate.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Good luck with that, Mr. President. You remember Apple would not even help crack the San Bernardino killer's phone. Remember that? Now, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump responded to the latest terror attacks today. Both believing the other is incompetent on the terror issue.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: Our local police, they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don't want to be accused of profiling. Do we have a choice? Look what's going on. Do we really have a choice? We are trying to be so politically correct in our country.\nCLINTON: We know that Donald Trump's comments have been used online for recruitment of terrorists. We have heard that from former CIA Director Michael Hayden who made it a very clear point when he said Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant for the terrorists.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Talking Points expects the terror deal to be in the forefront one week from tonight in the first debate. Secretary Clinton's anti-terror posture pretty much the same as what President Obama has been into place. Mr. Trump far more aggressive at least his words are in limiting the USA's exposure to Muslims abroad and punishing groups like ISIS. On the terror issue, Trump has the advantage as most Americans are pretty much fed up with the Jihad and want to see a more aggressive policy to defeat it. Trump has also emotion on his side. As the President and Mrs. Clinton continue to down play the Muslim angle, even though just about all the terrorism in the world is generated by Islamic fanatics.\nSumming up, Trump has a major opportunity on the national security issue if he lays out plans that are specific and not harmful to innocent folks. My grants and peaceful Muslims are not the problem. Jihadists are. The next president will have to set up the terror target and then punch it out. Anger is growing. And that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": ["PRES.
