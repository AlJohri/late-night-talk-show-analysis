This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nIn her new book, \"A Little Bit Vulnerable -- on Hollywood, Gods, Sobriety and Politics,\" she dishes on her romance with the very liberal and extremely hairy, Alec Baldwin, among other things.\nJanine stopped by The Factor last week along with her teenage daughter, Juliette, who also just published a book called \"Our President's Rock.\" Everybody is publishing books.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\nBILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST: So, here they are, the Turner people, Juliette and Janine. They both have books out. I don't know if I've ever heard of a mother and daughter having books out at the same time, all right.\n(LAUGHTER)\nSo, Juliette, I want to start with you. Most teenage girls -- you're 16, right.\nJULIETTE TURNER, : Yes, that's right.\nO'REILLY: OK. They don't care about history or their country or the Constitution. I mean, I'm not being supercilious here, arrogant, but that's the truth. How did you get involved with that.\nJULIETTE TURNER: Well, what you're saying is the truth. Sadly, my generation is not interested in history or the Constitution and that is part of what got me interested in history.\nBecause I realized that my generation is the future of our country. It's our responsibility to maintain our country and maintain our freedom, to know our history.\nAnd, also, a lot of my friends and kids my age don't want to sit down and read pages and pages of history textbooks. And so, what I tried to do with my book -- so what you smash so purposely in your book is making history fun and interesting.\nO'REILLY: Yes and you've succeeded. I mean, even I can understand the history that Juliette has put out there. But when you talk to your friends, do they think that you're like a nerd or weird or something.\n(LAUGHTER)\nJULIETTE TURNER: I've fully embraced my historical nerdability.\n(LAUGHTER)\nI am definitely --\nO'REILLY: But do you get that jazz that they give you.\n(LAUGHTER)\nJULIETTE TURNER: I sometimes do.\nO'REILLY: Do they give you like, \"Juliet, hey,\" you know, \"I wanna talk about,\" -- what is that -- \"One Dimension,\" or what group was that. I don't know.\n(LAUGHTER)\nJULIETTE TURNER: One Direction.\nO'REILLY: One Direction.\n(LAUGHTER)\nThe Fifth Dimension. I knew it was something like that. All right, but you don't care. You like your history.\nJULIETTE TURNER: Yes.\nO'REILLY: This is the second one. And we're proud of you.\nJULIETTE TURNER: Thank you.\nO'REILLY: All right, Janine, not so proud of you. You're a troublemaker.\nJANINE TURNER, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: OK.\nO'REILLY: You are a troublemaker. You know that.\nJANINE TURNER: Yes, I guess.\nO'REILLY: Now, about 20 years ago, you moved from Hollywood where you're a big -- you're a big star then --\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJANINE TURNER: Even though Mike and I have this very caring, very understanding relationship, that doesn't mean that you and I can't be friends.\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: Friends, huh.\nJANINE TURNER: Right.\nO'REILLY: -- \"Northern Exposure\" and all that stuff -- to Texas.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nJANINE TURNER: Yes.\nO'REILLY: To run play with rattlesnakes and run around with scorpions --\nJANINE TURNER: Longhorn cattle.\nO'REILLY: -- on the little ranch deal. In general, has that worked out for you career-wise.\nJANINE TURNER: Well, I think it's difficult when you're not in New York or L.A. And so it's definitely a sacrifice. I mean, I had worked. I mean, I just did three movies this year somehow.\nBut, also, my daughter was born in '97, so I wanted her to be around family in the state of Texas --\nO'REILLY: Right.\nJANINE TURNER: -- and to raise her there but there is a sacrifice.\nO'REILLY: Fresh air, all of that.\nJANINE TURNER: There is a sacrifice.\nO'REILLY: But you did pay a price in your career.\nJANINE TURNER: Yes.\nO'REILLY: OK.\nJANINE TURNER: Yes.\nO'REILLY: But you're still working now. You had some movies out and things like that.\nJANINE TURNER: Yes, yes. And it's given me an opportunity to focus on other things because I'm found raising my baby but I always want to be doing some things.\nO'REILLY: All right. Now, you're a conservative woman. That's accurate?\nJANINE TURNER: Yes.\nO'REILLY: OK. So, that, in addition to not being geographically close to Hollywood in New York, you are politically far away from them as well, all right.\nJANINE TURNER: Very much so.\nO'REILLY: Has that come back and hurt you.\nJANINE TURNER: I think so. I think it hurt me in my 20s, you know, because they were all running off to Jane Fonda parties, you know, and I wasn't.\nMy dad was a West Pointer. I wasn't about to go do that.\nO'REILLY: Right.\nJANINE TURNER: So, there was -- I was always sort of on the peripheral of the in-crowd. And, you know, never -- it took a little longer probably for \"Northern Exposure\" to happen for me. So, it's sad but it's not really --\nO'REILLY: But when you went on the set of \"Northern Exposure,\" --\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n-- for example, did they know you were a traditional person, not a liberal person.\nJANINE TURNER: I think so.\nO'REILLY: So, you shouldn't open your mouth --\n(LAUGHTER)\nNow, I saw you on \"Fox & Friends,\" you know. They had to pay you to go on that show. You just didn't go. Why, they didn't think \u2013 did Kilmeade give you some money.\nBut on \"Fox & Friends,\" you told them that you were once engaged to Alec Baldwin.\nJANINE TURNER: Yes.\nO'REILLY: That true?\nJANINE TURNER: That is true.\nO'REILLY: Officially engaged?\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJANINE TURNER: Officially engaged. I had the wedding dress, the invitations, the church book.\nO'REILLY: Really?\nJANINE TURNER: Everything.\n(LAUGHTER)\nO'REILLY: But he's insane. He was on Long Island, you know. I've known him for many --\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n-- he's nuts. Did you know that.\nJANINE TURNER: Well, maybe a little.\nO'REILLY: A little you knew it.\n(LAUGHTER)\nHe's a nice guy, I think, if you get him away from the politics, right.\nJANINE TURNER: Yes, he is.\nO'REILLY: But you were really serious. You were almost going to marry him.\nJANINE TURNER: I was. Yes, I had the invitations, addressed.\nO'REILLY: And what happened. Why didn't it -- why didn't it go through.\nJANINE TURNER: Well, we didn't break up because of politics.\nO'REILLY: No?\nJANINE TURNER: So, he was shocked. I called him and said, \"I read this article by William Sapphire in 'The New York Times' about young Republicans stepping forward.\" And there was this long pause.\n(LAUGHTER)\n\"You're a Republican?\"\nO'REILLY: Can you tell us why you didn't get married to him. You know, I don't want to get --\nJANINE TURNER: Well, you know, I just think it was -- it was just not -- it wasn't working.\nO'REILLY: All right, so you knew that this was not going to be a long-term deal.\nJANINE TURNER: But it wasn't because of the politics.\nO'REILLY: All right.\nJANINE TURNER: But now that I look back, I learned a lot from that relationship because --\nO'REILLY: And you still like him, right, as a person.\nJANINE TURNER: Yes, we're still friends.\nO'REILLY: Right.\nJANINE TURNER: And I ended up getting involved because of my relationship with him and a 12-step program. And I got sobered at age 23. So, sometimes, when things don't work out, --\nO'REILLY: Right.\nJANINE TURNER: -- you can look back and say, \"This is why God had\" --\nO'REILLY: But I think that is an amazing fun fact for Janine Turner.\nJANINE TURNER: OK.\nO'REILLY: Ladies, the best of luck with your books. It's nice to see you, girls.\nJANINE TURNER: Thanks.\nJULIETTE TURNER: Thank you so much. \u00a0\nContent and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
