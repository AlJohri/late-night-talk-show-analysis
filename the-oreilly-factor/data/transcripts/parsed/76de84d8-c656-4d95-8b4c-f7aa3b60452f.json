This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nO'REILLY: And in the \"Impact\" segment tonight, your questions about Donald Trump. If you saw The Factor on Friday, we do the same thing regarding Hillary Clinton. We posted that Q and A on BillO'Reilly.com.\nAnd tonight, we begin with Paul Goldstein, Jasper, Georgia. \"Will Trump place his financial interest in trust if he is elected?\"\nIn June, Trump said he will put his financial assets in a blind trust. But last January he told Maria Bartiromo over at FOX Business that his children will run the Trump empire if he's in the White House. So, the personal staff will get in the Trump, in the blind thrust, the business is run by his kids.\nJim Goldberg, Tinton Falls, New Jersey. \"If elected president, will Trump order the criminal investigation into Hillary's emails be reopen?\"\nLast month Trump told Kimberly Guilfoyle he would think about doing that quote, \"It's a possibility.\"\nDavid Harding, Appalachian, Virginia. \"Will Trump enforce federal laws against marijuana and override what some states are doing with legalization.\"\nOn The Factor last February, Trump addressed that question.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: In Colorado, you know, the book isn't written on it yet, but there is a lot of difficulty in terms of illness. And what's going on with the brain and the mind and what it's doing. So, you know, it's coming out probably over the next year or so. It's going to come out --\nO'REILLY: But what would you do as president?\nTRUMP: I would really want to think about that one, Bill.\nO'REILLY: All right.\nTRUMP: Because in some ways I think it's good and in other ways it's bad.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: When he said and in some ways I think it's good. That's medical marijuana he was referring to there. But that wasn't the topic. So bottom-line, Donald Trump would most likely leave the pot situation to the states.\nAnd Ed Simon, Las Vegas. \"How does Trump justify having some of the clothing he sells made overseas.\"\nIn June, Trump addressed that very question.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: My ties, many times are made in China. Not all of them by the way, but a lot of them are made in China because they have manipulated their currency to such a point that it's impossible for our companies to compete.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: And that means the cost is lower for Chinese made goods so American retailers can charge less, move more product. Standard business decision which is why China gets away with all the currency fixing.\nPaul Beaumont, Canary Islands. \"What does Trump think about the debate moderators?\" Not much apparently here is what the candidate said this morning.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: The fact is that they are gaming the system. And I think maybe we should have no moderator. Let Hillary and I just sit there and just debate because I think the system is being rigged so it's a very -- it's going to be a very unfair debate.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, that is a change from what Trump said last week when he was okay with the chosen moderators. By the way, Lester Holt from NBC set to moderate the first debate. Two weeks from tonight September 26th. I have known Holt for years. Worked with him at channel 2 here in New York City. He is a fair guy. No question about that.\nDavid Harsh, Connersville, Indiana. \"What is Trump's position on Social Security?\"\nOn a number of occasions, Trump has said he will not, will not reform Social Security. Won't even touch it, except to root out fraud.\nFred Pierre, North Chesterfield, Virginia. \"What is Trump's position on term limits for Congress?\"\nVague. He says he will take a look at it, but he is not taking any firm position. So, I don't think he cares about it just my opinion.\nCraig Humphrey, Dallas, Texas. \"What is the truth about Trump and the Iraq war?\"\nThe Iraq war began in 2003, before the shooting started, Trump told Neil Cavuto that Iraq was not the main threat to the U.S.A., North Korea was. In March of 2003, he told Cavuto the conflict looked like a military success. He did not openly begin criticizing the war until September 2003. From then on, he wasn't supportive of the effort at all. So looking at all the data, all the data, Trump was never a big fan of the Iraq war. Even before it started he talked to Howard Stern on the radio about a potential war in Iraq and it was kind of well, you know, that kind of thing. But never a big fan of it.\nTom Herrington, Jenison, Michigan. \"Is Trump using money from the RNC? How much of his own money has he spent on the campaign?\"\nTrump campaign says the candidate has spent about $60 million of his own money running for president so far. Republican National Committee makes no direct contributions but private donors are sending in cash. By the end of July, the Trump campaign had raised $128 million.\nGood questions, you guys, thank you.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
