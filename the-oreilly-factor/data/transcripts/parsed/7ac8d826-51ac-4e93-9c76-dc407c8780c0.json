We back that up with the timeline. On December 6th, 2013, in the African country of Guinea, the first patient with Ebola was identified. He is called Patient Zero, a 2-year-old child, who dies. A few months later, March 24th, 2014 authorities in Guinea report 87 suspected cases of Ebola. One week later, Liberia confirmed two cases of Ebola. The country of Sierra Leone also reported cases.\nOn April 1st, the organization Doctors without Borders warns that the Ebola contagion was quote, \"unprecedented\", unquote. On the same day, April 1st of this year, the Obama administration should have begun formulating a strategy to deal with West Africans coming to the U.S.A. from the Ebola regions. The Obama administration did not do that.\nIn fact, the first public mention, the first one from the feds came months later on July 28th.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJEN PSAKI, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN: On Ebola, we continue to closely monitor the outbreak of the virus. We're taking every precaution, of course, as would be expected.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: A month earlier, June 23rd, Doctors without Borders declares Ebola out of control in West Africa. On August 2nd, American doctor Kent Brantly, who was treating Ebola patients in Liberia, was flown to Atlanta for treatment of Ebola. He gets the disease. On August 5th, a second U.S. citizen, Christian missionary Nancy Writebol, flown to Atlanta from Liberia for Ebola treatment. Still -- still no public statement from President Obama. No coordinated strategy to protect Americans -- nothing.\nIn August -- Nigeria, Senegal, a number of African country close their borders to Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Also in August, British Airways and Air France suspend flights to those countries. What did the U.S.A. do? Nothing.\nFinally, on September 16th, President Obama musters enough energy to make this statement --\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want the American people to know that our experts here at the CDC and across our government agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Four days later, Liberian national Thomas Duncan enters the U.S.A., flying from Belgium to Washington to Dallas. On September 28th, Duncan is hospitalized in Dallas where, two days later, he's diagnosed with Ebola. There were no travel restrictions on Mr. Duncan -- none at all. October 8th, Duncan dies.\nOn October 12th, one of the nurses who treated him, Nina Pham, is diagnosed with Ebola. On October 15th, another nurse who treated Duncan, Amber Vinson, diagnosed with Ebola. Both nurses have been cured -- thanks to great medical people.\nOn October 17th, Dr. Craig Spencer, 33 years old, who was treating Ebola patients in Guinea, arrives back in the U.S.A. The CDC reports the doctor passed the Ebola screenings at the JFK airport which are set up to protect us. Dr. Spencer is not quarantined. Let me repeat, Dr. Spencer working directly with Ebola patients in Africa, not quarantined for 21 days, is allowed to roam around New York City unattended. Yesterday, Dr. Spencer calls 911, he's taken to Bellevue Hospital, he's diagnosed with Ebola.\nNow health authorities have to track down all the people with whom Dr. Spencer came into close contact. Three have already been quarantined. Are you getting the picture here?\nThe Obama administration simply cannot handle the Ebola situation. The airport screenings are a joke. The lack of a West African visa ban is negligence. That's the truth. But the liberal media, the Obama enablers, will not tell you the truth. Instead we have a \"New York Times\" editorial today saying, quote \"Starting Monday in six states, and rolled out in other states soon after, travelers who visited the Ebola region will be required to report their temperature and any other symptoms to state or local health officials daily for 21 days -- the maximum incubation period for the disease to develop. The officials will be responsible for finding and possibly detaining anyone violating these rules.\"\nAre you kidding me? The officials will be responsible for finding these people if they don't call in? They shouldn't be out of isolation. If you have direct contact with anyone in an Ebola region and you come back to the U.S.A., you should be in quarantine for 21 days, period.\nThe \"Times\" continues quote, \"The new measures surely make unnecessary a harmful ban on all travelers who have been in the three countries.\" Sure. Just ask Dr. Spencer. He went through the screening. It didn't work. That doesn't matter to \"The New York Times\" because the countries involved are poor and largely comprised of black Africans. That's why the Obama administration and the liberal press do not want a travel ban.\nNow, here's what should be happening -- no American airlines go to the Ebola region -- none. Charter flights are allowed, but those coming back to the U.S.A. on those charter flights have to be isolated for 21 days. You simply cannot have self-reporting. It doesn't work. So medical people, military people, diplomats, whoever it may be, have to give up three weeks of their lives when they return from the Ebola region. Otherwise, we're going to have more Ebola cases. That's just common sense.\nIt is long past time for the American people, you, to rise up and demand the federal government do its job which is to protect us. The feds will not control the borders. They will not confront the ISIS terrorists in an effective way. And now they will not institute simple restrictions against this vicious Ebola virus.\nLook, Dr. Spencer wore protective gear. So did the two Dallas nurses. This disease is fierce. You don't have self-reporting in a contagion like this. I'm sorry -- but the Liberians and the people in Guinea and Sierra Leone can't come here for a while. Also, those brave Americans who go over to help the poor Africans and we support them, but part of their sacrifice is being isolated for three weeks when they come back. That's it. And the longer the Obama administration delays these common sense protections, the angrier you, the American citizen, should get.\nFrom the very beginning of this horrible story, \"Talking Points\" has called for effective restrictions. Now I'm demanding them. Give your Senators and your Congresspeople an earful. Tell them to do their jobs.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["JEN PSAKI, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN: On Ebola, we continue to closely monitor the outbreak of the virus.
