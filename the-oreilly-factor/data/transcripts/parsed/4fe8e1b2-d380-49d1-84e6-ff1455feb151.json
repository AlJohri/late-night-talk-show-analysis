We can expect a lot of speeches. \"Talking Points\" well understands that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have hurt America's ability to confront evil around the world. President Obama and many Americans do not have the heart for another global conflict after the intense loss of blood and treasure since the attack on 9/11.\nBut the utter brutality that faces this country and the world today has to be confronted. And somebody has to lead that effort. It certainly won't be the Chinese leader or Putin or Merkel or David Cameron in Great Britain. The first three don't have the will, Cameron doesn't have the power. There is only one leader with the cache to lead the fight -- that reluctant warrior, Barack Obama.\nThis is now a so-called holy war between radical jihadists and everybody else including peaceful Muslims. ISIS has murdered thousands of innocent people who follow the teachings of Allah. The terror savages will kill anyone at any time. What is especially frightening is the continuing nonsense we see from Washington.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nMARIE HARF, STATE DEPARTMENT DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON: We're killing a lot of them and we're going to keep killing more of them. So are the Egyptians, so are the Jordanians, they are in this fight with us.\nBut we cannot win this war by killing them. We cannot kill our way out of this war. We need, in the longer term, medium and longer term to go after the root causes that lead people to join these groups, whether it's lack of opportunity for jobs --\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: So Miss Harf who spooks for the State Department, John Kerry, is telling the ISIS killers themselves and the world that organized military opposition cannot defeat the terror group.\nThat's just nonsense. If the world united against the jihad, it would be defeated. But, again, there is no effort to do that and so the atrocities continue. History will show that President Obama made an enormous mistake by failing to leave a residual force behind in Iraq. That could have quickly mobilized against the ISIS savages when they began infiltrating that country.\nAs we know the President was slow in recognizing the threat initially labeling ISIS the JV, junior varsity. President Obama also told the world that Yemen was a bulwark against al Qaeda, a success story. Yemen has now been overrun by jihadists -- American marines having to flee that country without their weapons.\nSo, on the President's watch the following countries have become safe havens: Syria, Iraq, northern Pakistan, eastern Nigeria, Libya, Somalia, Iran, parts of Algeria and parts of Afghanistan. That is quite a resume. We in America have been fortunate that our intelligence agencies and the FBI as well as local police have prevented another big attack like 9/11. Instead, we and other countries continue to absorb small blows from fanatical individuals.\nBut with ISIS expanding its territory and recruiting thousands of fanatical killers from all over the world, no one is safe. Therefore it is imperative that President Obama stop living in the theoretical, even fictional world. America is not able to fix economies in third world nations. We are not able to force Islamic despots to respect human rights. We are not able to convince the Iranian mullahs to stop supporting and harboring terrorists and to cease with the nukes.\nWe simply cannot do those things and to waste time throwing them out as possible solutions to dismantling the jihad is insulting and dangerous to the American people.\nThe holy war is here. And unfortunately it seems the President of United States will be the last one to acknowledge it.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["GEORGE WILL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Wouldn't you love to be a fly on the wall in the room where the White House semanticists meet every morning and figure out how they could possibly describe what happened without offending those who did it.
