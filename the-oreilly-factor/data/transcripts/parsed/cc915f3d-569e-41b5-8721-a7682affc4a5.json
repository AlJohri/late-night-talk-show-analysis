This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nO'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us, I'm Bill O'Reilly. In the \"Personal Story\" segment tonight, while campaigning at a diner in Manchester, New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton apparently told a story about how she attempted to join the marines after she moved to Arkansas in 1975. According to Mrs. Clinton, a recruiter turned her down.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nHILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He looks at me and he goes, how old are you? And I said, well, I'm 26. I will be 27. And he goes well, that's kind of old for us.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAnd then he says to me. Maybe the dogs will take you, meaning the army.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, that story has been around for decades but the \"The Washington Post\" decided to analyze it after the diner deal. Their conclusion is the story doesn't add up because there is no documentation. However, the newspaper did locate friends of Mrs. Clinton who back up her contention she tried to join the marines.\nWith us now Jessica Tarlov, democratic strategist and from Cleveland Capri Cafaro, democratic state senator from Ohio. So, isn't it like the Ben Carson stuff, Senator Cafaro?\nCAPRI CAFARO (D), OHIO STATE SENATOR: You know, honestly, you know, Dr. Ben Carson, he is, yes, he is under scrutiny right now by the media and part of that is because he is one of the frontrunners running for president of the United States. The most powerful and most important job in the world. So, he needs to expect to have this level of scrutiny and, yes --\nO'REILLY: Okay. But Hillary Clinton is running for president, too. I mean, I'm just trying, in your opinion, it's the same thing, isn't it?\nCAFARO: And you are covering this story. You know, absolutely. You know, people need to be held accountable.\nO'REILLY: Right. And 1975, you know, she said she tried to join the marines. The post is skeptical and now, Jessica, we have a mini situation on our hands.\nJESSICA TARLOV, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Mini. By the Clinton standards.\nO'REILLY: I mean, it's the same thing. I don't see any difference.\nTARLOV: Well, I think that as Capri was saying that both should be investigated. Maureen Dowd went after her I think --\nO'REILLY: Right.\nTARLOV: -- in 1994 about this story and the \"The Washington Post\" two Pinocchios.\nO'REILLY: What is two Pinocchios mean again?\nTARLOV: It sounds like the most lie like the biggest lie you could tell, I think like three or four Pinocchios is the most lies or the biggest lies but the truth of the matter is, you know, she should expect the scrutiny and she does this. This is the woman at every piece of her life investigated.\nO'REILLY: And I don't know why they gave her any Pinocchios, Senator.\nCAFARO: But I certainly, I mean, I agree with what Jessica was saying that I mean, Secretary Clinton has been under the hot light of scrutiny, most of her adult life. From Watergate to Benghazi or excuse me -- from white water to Benghazi, here is a woman whose life has been on display and this should be no surprise to her. I do think though that it is a little bit sexist, if I may say so myself. You know, we're not hearing anything about any of the male candidates who are of the --\nO'REILLY: Who tried to join the marines?\nCAFARO: Well, but we are not hearing about any of the male candidates.\nO'REILLY: But the male candidates aren't discussing it?\nCAFARO: Not signing up for Vietnam.\nO'REILLY: Well, wait, you know, they talked about Vietnam then you could say that. It's got to be contextual. It's not sexist to investigate whether Hillary Clinton did or did not try to sign up for the marines. That's what journalists are supposed to do. I mean, the sexist thing is --\nCAFARO: And you are absolutely right.\nO'REILLY: Come on.\nCAFARO: I mean, we do and that's what your job is doing and I think it's good to have the conversation.\nO'REILLY: I don't think she misled anybody. From what I read she went down to the recruiter office. I think she had another motivation right than actually going to Paris Island which I can't really see Hillary Clinton doing with all due respect.\nCAFARO: There is no good evidence one way or the other. I think that's why it's two Pinocchios.\nO'REILLY: Well, no, I mean, a friend say that she want wanted to go down and see how they would treat her for whatever reason.\nCAFARO: Because of her being a woman.\nO'REILLY: I think she was married or about two get married.\nTARLOV: Yes. She was going to be First Lady of Arkansas.\nO'REILLY: So maybe she was thinking, you know, maybe I will join the marines. And I wouldn't have to get married, I don't know but --\n(LAUGHTER)\nTARLOV: That's a little bit sexist, too.\nO'REILLY: Well, you know me, Senator. I mean, I'm like -- not a little bit I'm sexist. I'm a bigot. I'm a racist. Look, let's just get it on the table. I'm everything. Last word, Jessica.\nTARLOV: Well, as you said, I don't think that she mislead anyone here. We will get to the bought of it. As for the same Ben Carson or not, we need to know all the information about it, I'm glad to know that he did try to stab someone, that he took a hammer to his mother's head.\nO'REILLY: Right.\nTARLOV: I think that speaks to his character as a 17-year-old.\nO'REILLY: Well, 13 and then he turned it all around.\nTARLOV: But he also says things like, you know, the pyramids were used to store grain and he called ObamaCare the worst thing since slavery.\n(CROSSTALK)\nO'REILLY: -- Personal narrative.\nTARLOV: Yes.\nO'REILLY: Well, listen, what the Doctor says is certainly debatable and that's what we do here we debate.
