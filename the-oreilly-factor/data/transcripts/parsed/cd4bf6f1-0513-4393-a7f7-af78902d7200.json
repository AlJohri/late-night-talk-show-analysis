According to a new \"Washington Post,\" ABC News poll, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have 57 percent rating in the unfavorable category. CBS poll, Trump is 55 percent unfavorable. Hillary Clinton 52 percent.\nWall Street Journal, NBC poll 58 percent don't like Trump. Fifty four percent don't like Hillary. The question then becomes can these candidates overcome those negatives? Talking Points believes that many American voters will stay home this time around even though the campaign will be very intense. Right now Donald Trump has improved his polling because more than 80 percent of Republicans, many of whom did not support him before, are now on board with Mr. Trump. That support driven in part by a loathing for Hillary Clinton. On the other side, the numbers also more than 80 percent of Democrats supporting the secretary, but that's fairly predictable.\nMrs. Clinton, a liberal woman, who will carry on many of President Obama's policies. But Independent voters will decide who becomes the next president. Here, most candidates may have a problem. In Donald Trump's case, he would be wise to continue his self-described straight talk but shift the adjectives a little bit. His base is firm. Trump supporters love him, no matter what he does. He doesn't need to be demeaning in his speech unless it's an egregious situation. Mr. Trump's verbal use of shock and awe will only help him further if voters believe the insults are in context. Not designed simply to shock.\nAlso the more specific Donald Trump is on policy, the more votes he will get. In just a few moments, I will ask him very pointed questions about terrorism and the transgendered situation. As for Hillary Clinton, Talking Points has said this before, she needs to stop her calculated posture. There is no reason Mrs. Clinton should not debate Bernie Sanders on the FOX News Channel. As we said last week although she has the nomination locked up, she will reach millions of Independent voters in that debate and she will need them in the general election.\nAlso Mrs. Clinton should answer questions from people like me not just sympathetic journalists. Summing up, Independent Americans have the power this time around and both candidates should realize that.
