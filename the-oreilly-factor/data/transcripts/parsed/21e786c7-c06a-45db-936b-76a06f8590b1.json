As you know, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party are going to run on the promise that the federal government can fix so-called income inequality. Last night, I analyzed that fiction. And that edition of the Talking Points is posted on BillO'Reilly.com.\nBut the Republican Party as well is concerned about the growing wealth gap in America and that part of the story is real. A few American's are very very wealthy while the vast majority of we the people having trouble saving any money at all. The solution to that problem is better jobs and more of them. However, in order to secure those jobs, you, have to be qualified. Also, you have to have social skills. You have to understand how to behave in the marketplace. And that's where the liberal propaganda that the government can provide masses of people with good jobs falls apart.\nOn Sunday a liberal \"New York Times\" columnist Nicholas Kristof, a gang tried to persuade his readers, the big government programs can lift Americans out of bad economic circumstances.

My Brother's Keeper should be in every big city in the country with corporations picking up the tab. The truth is there are millions of Americans who want to help less fortunate people. Who want to help children who will need help. Who will give their time and money to do that.
