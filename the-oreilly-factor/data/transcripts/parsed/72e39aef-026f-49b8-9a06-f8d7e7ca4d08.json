This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nO'REILLY: \"Factor Follow Up Segment\" tonight as mentioned in the \"Talking Points Memo\" some of Hillary's top aides have been interviewed by the FBI about the email case. We don't know if Mrs. Clinton herself will be called.\nWhat we do know is that some employees at the Justice Department, which runs the FBI, have helped Hillary Clinton out at least in campaign donations. Data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics says $75,000 donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign.\nWith us now David Bossie, chairman of the board of Citizens United, a watchdog group. Is this a big deal?\nDAVID BOSSIE, CITIZENS UNITED: It is a big deal. I mean look, this just another piece of evidence. Look, Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General herself is a Clinton appointee by Bill Clinton. She owes her career to Bill Clinton.\n$75,000 doesn't sound like a lot of money but it's by key people in decision-making --\nO'REILLY: Miriam Vogel, associate deputy attorney general; Renata Hesse, principal deputy assistant general for criminal and civil operations; Brian Boynton -- these are big names, these are big guys and gals and they're giving thousands of dollars. But --\nBOSSIE: They're decision-makers. That's the most important thing. How can the American people have confidence in an impartial investigation?\nO'REILLY: Let me challenge that. It's the FBI that has to make the recommendation whether to prosecute or not. Ok?\nBOSSIE: Yes, sir.\nO'REILLY: It's the FBI.\nBOSSIE: Ok.\nBOSSIE: And they are not tainted any way that we know of. And Comey, the director came out today and said he feels pressured to wrap up the investigation. Good. Good. Because we need to know before we go to the polls what happened.\nBut when you get into the Justice Department, that's a huge apparatus and they're American citizens. They have a right to donate to anybody they want. In fact a couple voted -- I mean a couple -- donated to Donald Trump like $500.\nBOSSIE: Sure.\nO'REILLY: So you are saying they shouldn't have anybody, any political donations?\nBOSSIE: Look, I think that it tinges the investigation. The American people are going to look at this and say was this an impartial investigation? Was it a thorough investigation? Was it fair?\nHillary Clinton has to be called for by FBI for an investigation. If she is not, there is a problem with that.\nO'REILLY: That would be strange. But the American people are going to decide based upon what the outcome is. So she is not indicted and conservatives who don't like her are going to say it's tainted. You know that.\nBOSSIE: Look, what we want -- what conservatives want is impartial investigation. That's why Congress, which should be doing something and is not, we have been calling for them to do something. Look, Janet --\nO'REILLY: What about -- what about Comey? What about Comey -- do you trust him?\nBOSSIE: You know, I do. I knew Jim Comey back many years ago. He is a -- he is really the last voice --\nO'REILLY: He's an honest guy, yes.\nBOSSIE: -- he seems like he's a very squared-away individual and I trust him. But look, Janet Reno as much as she wanted to put on the facade --\nO'REILLY: That was a joke.\nBOSSIE: -- she was a joke but she appointed seven independent councils on the Clintons and their cabinet.\nO'REILLY: And none of them did anything.\nBOSSIE: But for a reason.\nO'REILLY: Yes, for a reason. She appointed them and they didn't do anything. Janet Reno was the worst attorney general in the United States' history.\nBOSSIE: Without question.\nO'REILLY: All right now, Facebook, same thing. Same thing. You heard about this Facebook shuts out conservative postings, all right, in favor of liberal postings. The guy who is in charge of that, Tom Stocky, apparently he and his wife gave $5,400 to Hillary Clinton.\nBOSSIE: Right.\nO'REILLY: Here is Tom. And I have been saying this from the jump on Yahoo and these other deliverers you can't find conservative opinion on them.\nBOSSIE: Without question.\nO'REILLY: Everybody goes, \"Oh, you are crazy it's an aggregate. It's this, it's that.\" I go, \"Baloney. Those are human beings making this decision.\"\nBOSSIE: No, this is false advertising. They are saying this is a mathematical algorithm.\nO'REILLY: Yes, baloney.\nBOSSIE: It is baloney. And this is what -- look, there is some whistle blower saying we stepped on conservative content and propped up liberal content and now this guy who is in charge of content is a Clinton donor.\nO'REILLY: Yes. Tom Stocky.\nBOSSIE: It makes it. It doesn't look very good for them.\nO'REILLY: And he looks like he is like 16 years old. Put his picture up there again. Really, when I saw this guy I thought they were remaking \"Leave It to Beaver\" and he was going to play Wally. But these guys -- they are in their 20s. They are young people.\nBOSSIE: Right.\nO'REILLY: Nobody is looking at them. There is no editor there. They can throw up what they want to throw up.\nBOSSIE: They can. It's a private company. They can do anything they want.\nO'REILLY: Right.\nBOSSIE: But the consumers -- conservatives have to understand that Facebook is not treating conservatives fairly.\nO'REILLY: I don't think Yahoo is and I don't know about Google. I don't go there very much. But I think that whole Internet is stacked against any kind of traditional conservative thought. Last word?\nBOSSIE: I just think Facebook needs to make sure that the American people -- their consumers -- liberals, conservatives, independents, understand that they're being treated fairly. And I don't think the evidence proves that right now. They have a long way to go.\nO'REILLY: Ok. Mr. Bossie, thanks you very much.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
