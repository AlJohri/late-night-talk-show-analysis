LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is a race baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot. And you know how you make America great again?

Where the hell has everybody been?\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, let's examine this without emotion or agenda. Ok -- both can cloud thinking.\nThe federal courts would never, never allow the government to deny anyone entry solely on the basis of religion so the whole discussion is really moot. Good night, everyone.\nAs with revoking the citizenship of so-called anchor babies, a ban on Muslims traveling to the U.S.A. will never happen. However, however -- the feds do have an obligation to deny visas to anyone who might cause harm to the country. Thus, people living in countries where jihad and terrorism are rife can and should be scrutinized with the burden of proof being put upon those who want to come here.\nHomeland security should deny visas to any questionable person -- period. But a complete ban of Muslims would actually hurt the war on terror.\nHere's the crux of the matter, which I will discuss with Mr. Trump here tomorrow on The Factor. The U.S. and other western nations need moderate Muslim countries to fight the jihadists. The West can't defeat the jihad without the help of Jordan, Egypt, to some extent Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf States. We need them to cooperate with us militarily and with intel.\nBy saying all Muslims can't come to the U.S.A. that means that King of Jordan can't come. So, it is simply bad anti-terror policy to overreact and prohibit Muslims even if you could, which you can't.\nIt is long past time for Americans to see the jihad for what it is -- a movement that seeks to destroy western civilization. Someone tell President Obama.\nBut the majority of Muslims do not support jihad and some will actually fight against it. Those people should be applauded, not demonized.\nBut and here is where Donald Trump is correct. The Obama administration is losing the fight against ISIS as \"Talking Points\" clearly said last night. Political correctness and weakness, rank weakness, now dominate Washington. Many of our politicians are afraid to confront evil. I'm talking to you, Democratic Party.\nWe, the people, must rise up and demand to be protected. Demand that the war be waged against the jihad in a smart and aggressive way.\nWith the Presidential election next year, it is now on us to elect a new leader who has the guts and the intelligence to fight Islamic terrorism and defeat it. Believe me, this is 1938 all over again.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["CARLY FIORINA (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think Donald Trump's over reaction is as dangerous as President Obama's under reaction.SEN.
