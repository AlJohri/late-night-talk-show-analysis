The problems we face now, poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad, will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: But President Obama does not buy Mr. Trump's allegations. Instead he paints an optimistic picture.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nPRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: But it's also important for the American people to remember that our crime rate in this country is much lower than it was in the 80's or the 90's or when I first took office. That immigration rates are substantially lower than they were when Ronald Reagan was president. That, you know, as serious as these terrorist attacks are. The fact of the matter is that the American people are significantly more safe now than they were before all the work that we have done since 9/11.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Talking Points is in business to put forth the truth. So here it is. According to an average of polling by Real Clear Politics, 69 percent of Americans are unhappy with the direction of their country. Just 23 percent are pleased with the present condition of the U.S.A. That is a direct repudiation of President Obama's point of view. Because, if we're all safer as he says, and the economy is fine, why would the folks feel the country is on the wrong stack? Why?\nThe perception problem is twofold. Americans believe that a stagnant economy is making it very difficult for workers to increase their salaries, and that's true. Majority of Americans also believe that disorder, disorder both at home and around the world is putting them in actual danger. Donald Trump has capitalized on those sentiments saying he will make things better. Hillary Clinton seems to mostly support President Obama's vision but does acknowledge the economic problem.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nHILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I want an economy that gets back to raising incomes for everybody. Most Americans haven't had a raise. I want an economy that is going to help lift millions of people out of poverty because given the great recession we have fallen back in the wrong direction.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: But the great recession was nearly nine years ago. I mean, come on. By this time the American economic engine should be roaring. Instead growth this year estimated to be below two years. That's dismal. Now, there are three new polls in the Trump/Clinton race. CNN has it 48, 45 Trump. So, he got a bounce out of the Republican convention last week according to CNN. CBS has it 44 percent-43 Trump a tie. Los Angeles Times has 45 percent-41 Trump over Clinton. So, despite all the controversy surrounding Donald Trump, if the election were held today he might very well win.\nHowever, to be fair, perhaps Hillary Clinton will get a bounce out of her convention this week. Now, back to the problems. Higher taxes and massive income redistribution will not stimulate the economy. So Mrs. Clinton is going to have to deal with that and separate herself from the Obama machine or run on the economy we have now. Many in the Democratic Party support open borders, that means the consequences of the legal drug implication, illegal aliens, committee crimes, and higher competition for law wage jobs will continue if there were open borders, will they not?\nIt will be interesting to see if any Democrat puts forth a specific solution to deal with illegal immigration this week. On the foreign front President Obama's decision to pull all U.S. troops out of Iraq directly led to the rise of ISIS. The President's failure to attack ISIS on the ground has allowed the savages to expand their influence. Mr. Obama's failure to destroy Assad's Air Force in Syria, when he could have, after drawing that red line over poison gas has directly led to millions of refugees storming into Europe.\nThat crisis has profoundly damaged the region and perhaps even stimulated Great Britain leaving the European Union. President Obama's failure to confront Putin in Russia has directly led to chaos in Ukraine and Eastern Europe. The Iranian nuke deal has increased the power of the mullahs in the Middle East. The Libyan debacle has given ISIS to put hold in that country. The Chinese are expanding in South East Asia.\nAfghanistan is now a sanctuary not only for the Taliban but also for ISIS terrorists who killed 80 people over the weekend in Kabul. The list goes on. Back home, race relations are worse than at any time since the 1960's. In some areas, police and young black men even fear for their lives. The far left has run wild under President Obama selling a narrative that America is a bad country, an evil country. Dominated by white supremacy. Drug use is skyrocketing.\nEven as the Obama administration puts forth that criminals who sell poison like heroin, meth, and cocaine are nonviolent. And deserve leniency. Political correctness destroying free speech. And giving power to the charlatans who are clogging the court system with frivolous lawsuits. Again, Talking Points could go on for hours. So Donald Trump may be terrifying voters with his rhetoric as a \"New York Times\" says, but his warnings are based in reality, are they not?\nForeign and domestic terrorism is a contagion that is not being effectively confronted. Americans understand that all our lives have been changed. It's now routine, routine to see innocent people slaughtered in the streets. All of what I have just laid out in this Talking Points is in stone truth. No spin. And that truth has led to the rise of a strong man politician Donald Trump. The Democratic convention this week will seek to counter Mr. Trump. We will see if it succeeds.
