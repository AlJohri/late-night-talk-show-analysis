Trying to put Donald Trump on the defensive. Mrs. Clinton must be stunned by the turn around in the polls, especially in states like Florida and Ohio, which she needs to win. Therefore, the Clinton campaign had to make a statement and chose the personal route, the main theme of her talk today was that Trump is personally unfit to be president.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nCLINTON: Donald Trump looks at President Obama after eight years as our president, he still doesn't see him as an American. Think of how dangerous that is. Imagine a person in the Oval Office who traffics in conspiracy theories and refuses to let them go. No matter what the facts are. Imagine someone who distorts the truth, to fit a very narrow view of the world. Imagine a president who sees someone who doesn't look like him, and doesn't agree with him and thinks, that person must not be a real American.\nIn addition to the President, Donald Trump looks at a distinguished federal judge, born in Indiana, and he sees a Mexican, not an American. He looks at a Gold Star family and sees them as Muslims, not patriotic Americans. He looks at women and decides how our looks rate on a scale of one to 10.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, it is clear that Secretary Clinton is playing the invective card. There was little policy in her speech today. It was all about redemonizing Donald Trump as an unstable guy who is hostile to a variety of Americans. Now, will that tactic work? Probably not. Because those who believe as Mrs. Clinton does, are already in her camp. They are already there. By this time, the 10 percent or so of Americans who are still persuadable in the election have heard all the anti-Trump stuff before.\nThe big reason Hillary Clinton went after Trump in a personal way is to refocus negative attention on him, media attention. Thereby, taking it off her. Today, in the \"L.A. Times\" daily tracking poll, which bounces around a lot, Trump is now up by six percent after two weeks of press scrutiny on Hillary Clinton. The more extensive national polling from FOX News and others has Trump either beating very close to Hillary Clinton, among likely voters. That shocked the Democratic Party because Mr. Trump is an unusual candidate to say the least.\nAnd has major baggage as any big time businessman would. But, Secretary Clinton's resume problems are more extensive than Donald Trump's because of the FBI investigation and others. That is holding Secretary Clinton back. For his part, Trump seems to be listening to his new team, which has imposed discipline on the campaign. Today in Washington, some generals endorsed Trump, concentrating on national security and the military. In that exposition, Trump spoke for less than 30 seconds dealing with the birther issue.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again. Thank you.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Ironically, just before Trump said that just before, President Obama actually helped him out unwittingly.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nPRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: We got other business to attend to. I was pretty confident about where I was born. I think most people were as well, and my hope would be that the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: So, Trump caught a break today with Mr. Obama assisting in getting the birther issue off the table. Going forward, there are 10 days until the first debate. Both candidates will be doing serious prep work with their presentations on Monday, September 26th at Hofstra University on Long Island. The whole world will be watching this debate. And there is no coming back if you screw up. Big time pressure. So, it would behoove, word of the day, behoove, both of the candidates to avoid controversy before the debate. Personal attacks at this point will most likely hurt the attacker.\nIt was almost pathetic today. Pathetic, to watch the ravings on cable news by anti-Trump zealots. Did you guys just find out about the birther issue? If Trump is conceding the point, why the vitriol? Again, hatred never plays well with the folks. What fair-minded Americans really want are solutions to vexing problems. They want specifics. They want clarity. They want consistency. Whoever delivers that best from here on will win the White House.
