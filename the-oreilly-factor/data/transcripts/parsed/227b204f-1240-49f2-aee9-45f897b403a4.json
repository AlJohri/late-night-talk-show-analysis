And many liberal folks want open borders, sympathizing with poorer people who have come to America for a better life. Some other Americans see the illegal alien invasion as an intrusion, resulting an America changing dramatically in many ways. Both sides are dug in and mostly unpersuadable.\nSo \"Talking Points\" believes the President of the United States should now be the focus of the debate. There's no question that by unilaterally giving legal status to millions of undocumented people, the President is challenging the Constitution. It was only one hour, one hour before the President's speech last night, that the Justice Department put forth statement saying what the President was doing was legal. In the past, the President himself said it was illegal for him to grant millions of undocumented folks the right to stay in America.\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" a very sympathetic immigration editorialize today this way quote, \"Mr. Obama is issuing his order amid furious political opposition and after his own multiple previous declarations that he lacks legal authority.

Ronald Reagan did that, George H.W. Bush can do that. He can do that for a class of people, a small class of people -- 100,000 here, 100,000 there.\nWhen he does it for half the foreign nationals who are in this country illegally the practical effect of that is not just nullifying their deportations, it's nullifying the law.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: So according to Judge Napolitano it's about numbers it's about an abuse of prosecutorial discretion.

Certainly, there was immense pressure on the Republican leadership to do that. But President Obama was in the rush and the question is why?\nSpeculation from the right says the President wants to trap the Republican Party into overreacting.
