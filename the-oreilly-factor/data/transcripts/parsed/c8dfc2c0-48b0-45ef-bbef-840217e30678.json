I think some of it is coming out of the fact that we have so many home environments in this country that are not home environments in the traditional sense, that there is no direction at home.\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Talking Points has been saying that for years and it's true. If an American child does not have guidance and supervision in the home, there is a good chance that kid will get involved with antisocial behavior quickly. So, for police authorities, things are not good out on the street across the country right now. And when you add in liberal mayors and prosecutors, who handcuff the cops, pardon the pun, things get even worse.\nCase in point, Marilyn Mosby, prosecuting six Baltimore police officers in the death of Freddie Gray. Ms. Mosby, we now learn, was so concerned about drug activity in poor Baltimore neighborhoods, she ordered police to step up aggressive action against street pushers. Freddie gray was one of those dealers with a long rap sheet of drug involvement including heroin. So that's the most likely reason the cops chased Gray and put him into custody. He died a short time later.\nAsked about her order, Miss Mosby stonewalled.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nMARILYN MOSBY, BALTIMORE CITY STATE'S ATTORNEY: I'm not going to litigate this case in the media. I will litigate it in the courtroom. So I'm not going to discuss my evidence or the strategy or any of that.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Speaking on this issue of drug use and cutting down on drug abuse, you ordered the police department to follow the Mountain Street and North Street area.\nMOSBY: I cannot talk about the specifics of any of this case, prosecutorial ethics precludes me from doing so.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: That is not true. Miss Mosby can certainly define what her antidrug policy was before the Freddie Gray incident. The woman is dodging, no question.\nIf you were around the late 1960s or early 70s you know history is repeating itself. Back then the American establishment embraced the war in Southeast Asia that forced millions of young Americans to be drafted. The war turned out to be a fiasco because of the politicians not the U.S. military. So distrust among young Americans skyrocketed. That led to a breakdown of authority and the rise of the sex, drugs, and rock `n' roll era.\nToday we have the era of self-absorption where many Americans simply don't care about society in general. They are locked into their own worlds, encouraged by high tech. The collapse of authority in America will lead to very bad consequences.
