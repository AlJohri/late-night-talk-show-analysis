This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nO'REILLY: \"Impact\" segment tonight, the sheriff of Pinal County, Arizona about 70 miles north of Mexico, says that President Obama has issued a de facto amnesty for all illegal aliens. Sheriff Paul Babeu joins us now from Phoenix, why do you say all, there is only supposed to be five million or so Sheriff?\nPAUL BABEU (R), SHERIFF OF PINAL COUNTY ARIZONA: Right five or six million so says the President yet in reality what he talked about is those who have been here for five year or more, they are now eligible for the President's legal permanent status. And so what we're going to see happen, and we've seen this happen before is the age of the fraudulent documents. You're going to see fraudulent lease agreements for rental properties. You're going to see fraudulent utility bills, all the documents that the President will need to satisfy the very tertiary (ph) look to satisfy the requirement for his legal status.\nAnd so this literally will encompass just about everybody, the 11 to 20 million illegals who are here, because clearly they are not interested in fully enforcing the law.\nO'REILLY: Of course, anybody who can get in will. Well tell me about these fraudulent documents I mean how common are they, how easy are they to produce? Do you see them on a regular basis?\nBABEU: Absolutely, the number one crime today in the United States is identity theft. And we see this time and time again both as my days as a patrol officer, and now as a sheriff, we run into the fake IDs and documents all of the time, we've actually run into these exact situations where we've stop illegals for breaking the law, and whether it is for a traffic violation or some other call that we are on. And the Supreme Court requires us to if we have a reasonable suspicion that a person is in the country illegally, we ask that question and then we call I.C.E.\nAnd we have these conversations with I.C.E., and they say well how long is the person been in the country and they say well they're here for five years or longer and they say well treat them as any other citizen. So if you and I just came here from Honduras or some other country and the obvious response to that question is we've been here for five years or six years, even though we have been here for only six months.\nO'REILLY: So that is lying though. I mean I'm talking about the fraudulent documents, the Social Security cards as you mentioned, the utility bills, the rental agreements. Is there an industry in Pinal County in Arizona that grinds these things out and are they easy to get?\nBABEU: Absolutely. And this is where you're going to see this happen. We have seen it in Chandler where you can buy these documents for $50, $75 or $100. And I had a conversation again today with the Chief Ron Coburn who is a deputy director of the border patrol who says we're going to this mass production of these fake documents just to satisfy this requirement to get above the six million that the President just said could stay here without --\nO'REILLY: Yes. I mean look, it makes perfect sense that that industry would just harvest itself right away. Now as far as your county is concerned, you have plenty of immigrants, both legal and illegal.\nBABEU: Yes.\nO'REILLY: Is this going to change the way that your community operates?\nBABEU: Absolutely. We already see the impact here, and you're going to see it across the country, the impact of what the President just did is to say to the hey, millions of illegals who have yet to come here, make it to the border, and you are home free. Because we have just announced -- we arrested cartel scouts. These are drug cartel scouts that are providing safe passages for the cartels to bring their drugs into the United States.\nThese are the guys on mountaintops with the binoculars and the encrypted radios that are there for a month at a time. This is 70 miles north of the border. Clearly the border is not secure. We see these illegals -- 123,000 was the last number the border patrol put out here. So if you see these numbers, this is what we call clues in law enforcement that the border isn't secure.\nWhy doesn't the President put that as a priority, America's security, and securing the border first for once? Instead of putting the priorities and the interests of people who have disrespected our laws and our process? And that is what I would request this Congress do is to offer solutions to the President and turn the tables back on him.\nO'REILLY: All right. Sheriff, we appreciate it. Thanks very much.\nBABEU: Thank you.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
