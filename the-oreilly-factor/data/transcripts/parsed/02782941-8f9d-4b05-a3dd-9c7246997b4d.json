And part of our goal as the world's leading super power is to work with partner countries to try to resolve conflicts, to be ruthless in going after terrorism. But we're not going to do that by ourselves and we are not going to do it just by deploying more marines in every country that has these problems.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: But it's not about deploying marines on the ground. It's about motivating the free world to confront the jihad and other threats to global order. The President also refers to partner countries. But as we pointed out, the 60-nation coalition allegedly united to fight ISIS does little or nothing. And most folks agree with me.\nAccording to a brand new Fox News poll which asked how are things going in the fight against ISIS: very well 3 percent; somewhat well 30 percent; somewhat badly 34 percent; very badly, 29 percent.\nDo you approve of how President Obama is handling Iran? 32 percent approve; 57 percent disapprove. And it's worth noting that about 32 percent of Americans according to polls will back anything Barack Obama does -- anything. So he isn't getting much support outside his Kool-Aid folks.\nTo me, President Obama's living in a dream world and he gets away with it because the real world doesn't really care. Putin knows that. The jihadists also know it. They can commit atrocity after atrocity and little is done.\nThe rise of ISIS is a disgrace to the world. It should have been stamped out immediately after those killers began murdering civilians. But President Obama and the world dithered.
