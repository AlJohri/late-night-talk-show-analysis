Investors' business daily has Trump up by two. CBS News, Clinton by four. FOX News Clinton by four. The battleground states, Quinnipiac has Clinton leading by one in Florida. Emerson Trump up by seven in Ohio. \"New York Times\" has at a tie in North Carolina. Remington Research has Trump up by one in Nevada. In New Hampshire, this chaos, Emerson has Clinton up by one.

The Electoral College map is actually less solid for Clinton than it was for Obama four years ago. Four years ago we had Obama ahead in states totaling 320 some electoral votes. Clinton has about 270. So, she is one state away from potentially losing Electoral College. He would rather be in her shoes than Donald Trump's but it's not a terribly safe position.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Again, Talking Points is not going to make a prediction on the presidential race but I will tell you that the Trump folks are hanging their hopes on voters who shun the polls who do not participate on that kind of thing.
