The boys arrived in Brooklyn, New York without adult supervision as their family back in Ireland couldn't support them. They made their way by doing hard labor and building new lives.\nThose boys were the first of my ancestors on my father's side to come to this country. Over the years, their families became Democrats -- the reason, economics. Working men and women in the northeast had to struggle to gain decent wages and Democrats were sympathetic to that struggle.\nBack then many Democrats were traditional people, people of faith and family. And their party reflected that through the decades, John F. Kennedy was a traditional guy. So was Tarry Truman and Lyndon Johnson.\nBut today the Democratic Party has turned far left. President Obama has led that march and his acolytes in Congress are currently violating federal immigration law, embracing a quasi-socialistic economic theory. And as we reported last night even embracing radical anti-police groups like Black Lives Matter.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do we want?\nCROWD: Dead cops.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: When do we want them?\nCROWD: Now.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do we want?\nCROWD: Dead cops.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: When do we want them?\nCROWD: Now.\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think the reason that the organizers used the phrase Black Lives Matters was not because they were suggesting nobody else's lives matter, rather what they were suggesting was there is a specific problem that is happening in the African-American community that's not happening in other communities.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, it's hard to believe that a sitting president is sympathetic to a group that's calling for violence against American police officers.
