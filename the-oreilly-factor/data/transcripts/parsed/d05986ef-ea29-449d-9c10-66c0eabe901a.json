Latest ABC News tracking poll has Trump up by one. Rasmussen has the race tied. Investors' business daily has Hillary Clinton up by one. The Real Clear Politics average, Clinton by 2.2 percent, which is a virtual tie.\nIt all comes down to electoral votes and we will analyze those in just a few moments. No matter who wins the presidency, Americans will be uneasy. Let's take Hillary Clinton first. Mrs. Clinton has devoted herself to public service in three decades but has not really achieved anything outstanding. Her major accomplishment was helping the state and city of New York after the 9/11 attack. As senator here she did a very good job getting resources in to a devastated area. As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton actively participated in President Obama's failed attempt to place the U.S.A. in a subordinate position overseas.\nAs we all know, Mr. Obama did not want to lead, rather he hesitated in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, in confronting Russia. That policy is turning out to be disastrous and Hillary Clinton was his secretary of state for much of the retreat. That is not a partisan analysis. That is a fact. All you have to do is look at what is happening in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Europe, South China Sea, Iran, and the Persian Gulf not to mention North Korea. Foreign policy under Barack Obama has been a chaotic failure. Our enemies do not, do not fear us.\nIf Hillary Clinton is elected president, there is really no reason for optimism. She supported the failure of ObamaCare. She has veered sharply left in her social beliefs. Now, she doesn't even oppose partial birth abortion on the day a baby would be born. As for the economy, Mrs. Clinton is a tax and spend liberal. And that policy has not stimulated growth for eight long years in this country. Now, on the other side there is Donald Trump. Completely untested in geo politics. Mr. Trump has made big promises that he will return prosperity to the U.S.A. and regain a leadership role for America and the world. That will not be easy.\nAnd Mr. Trump has no track record, no achievements to bolster his rhetoric. Instead he has a checkered business record. Although, to be fair, he has overcome big setbacks to build a very powerful business brand. Mr. Trump is running as an outsider who promises to clean up Washington and that message alone has a tremendous appeal. As everyone knows, his personal life as entertainer has been controversial. He is a blunt speaker who sometimes does not think before he makes public statements and that has hurt him with minority Americans and those who fear confrontation.\nIf Mr. Trump is elected president, he will take office with the least amount of political experience of any commander-in-chief in history. So voters, you guys are faced with more negatives than positives in this election. Hillary Clinton is portrayed as a dishonest person who has had controversy after controversy. Donald Trump is portrayed as an immature rogue who has had controversy after controversy. That's the choice America faces one week from today. In the end, it should come down to your own belief system and which candidate better reflects that. It's personal.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "In the wake of the latest email chaos, Donald Trump is gaining in the national polling.
