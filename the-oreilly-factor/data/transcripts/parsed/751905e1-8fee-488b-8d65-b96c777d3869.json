Absolutely nothing happened to her. And we never learned if higher government officials were involved in that IRS scandal. However, we did learn this.

BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: No. And there are some boneheaded decisions.\nO'REILLY: Boneheaded decisions. But no mass corruption.\nOBAMA: Not even mass corruption, not even a smidgen of corruption.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Talking Points believes the Obama administration did not want to know what happened with the IRS. The left-wing media did not want to know nor did the Democratic Party. And we don't know. So today, we have two big time political allegations. Whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia and whether National Security advisor Susan Rice was spying on the Trump campaign and transition team using her position with President Obama in the White House to surveilled and hurt Donald Trump.\nAnswers to both of those questions have not been provided to the American people as they must be if we are to keep our election system legitimate. The FBI's investigating the Russian deal. I'm not sure where the agency is on the illegal surveillance issue. The bureau has not defined it. But Congress is looking into Miss Rice.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I've asked the Intelligence Committee, Senator Burr, Senator Warner to conduct a bipartisan investigation of this whole episode. They will conduct it. Hopefully at the end we'll find out what happened and I'll issue a report I hope on a bipartisan basis.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Not likely. As Democrats and the liberal media have already acquitted Susan Rice.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE RANKING MEMBER: One of the central figures the Republicans went after and after was Susan Rice. And after two years, they could find nothing that Susan Rice did wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Congressman Schiff, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee speaking about Miss Rice's role in Benghazi investigation and putting forth the opinion that she's a scapegoat even before any testimony is heard. This Congressman Schiff really wanted know what happened in the surveillance deal? You make the call. But it's obvious his fellow travelers on the left do not want to know, in fact the loons are now branding the whole thing racial.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nDAVID CORN, BUREAU CHIEF, MOTHER JONES WASHINGTON: Did she do something wrong? There's no information indicating that so they are making her, you know, basically they're defaming her without any reason to do so because she's a woman, maybe because she's a black woman.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: As Talking Points said yesterday, Susan Rice is entitled to the presumption of innocence and should be called by Congress to testify as soon as possible. But with Easter break looming, that call will be down the road. At that time, I expect Miss Rice to take the Fifth just as Lois Lerner did. That means others in government will have to step forward to testify about what Susan Rice did or did not do in order for we the people to know.\nToday, President Trump said he believes the surveillance situation is, quote, \"Going to be the biggest story, it is such an important story for our country and the world, it is one of the biggest stories of our time,\" unquote. It's clear the President has a vested interest in this having tweeted he was surveilled by President Obama himself. So, obviously Mr. Trump would like to know what happened. But the anti-Trump folks will try to prevent some light on Susan Rice, no question about that.\nBecause if the former National Security advisor was using her very high office to help the Democratic Party before and after the election, that's a huge scandal. And President Obama will have to be questioned about it. That's a big if, and premature conclusions as well as speculations are the enemies of true justice. The polls say most Americans want answers to the Russian intrusion into the presidential election and I believe most of us want to know the full Susan Rice story as well.\nIf the federal government cannot define both situations fairly quickly, this nation is a major trouble.
