Michael Flynn] has resigned because the Trump administration says it lost confidence in him.\nThe story is a bit complicated but it boils down to this:\nFlynn had phone contact with the Russian ambassador in late December while Barack Obama was still president.\nAccording to leaks from the intelligence agencies, Flynn discussed Mr. Obama's sanctions against Russia.\nThen General Flynn denied that to Vice President Mike Pence.\nThe FBI also interviewed General Flynn and, if he lied to them, that would be a crime.\nHowever, that's a big if.\nIt is not a crime for Mr. Flynn to informally talk with the Russian Ambassador before Donald Trump took office, but it is highly inappropriate if policy was discussed.\nSo at this point, Flynn is out and it looks like retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward will take his place.\nAdmiral Harward is 60-years-old, has extensive military experience and served in Afghanistan.\nLooks like a solid choice, but you never know.\nBy the way, the FBI is still investigating the whole Russian situation and that's all we know at this point.\nBut lack of facts doesn't stop the anti-Trump press from whipping up hysteria.\nThere are two things in play.\nFirst, the Trump-haters are fervently hoping that they can link the Trump campaign to the Russian hackers who disrupted the Clinton campaign.\nThat's the ultimate goal for the haters.\nIf they cannot achieve that, they would like to have General Flynn tell the world that Donald Trump ordered him to call the Russian ambassador.\nSo that's the media game plan.\nNow yesterday the bombast on our cable competition was actually humorous.\nNew York Times columnist Thomas Friedman compared the Russian hacking to war.\nTHOMAS FRIEDMAN, NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST: \u201cWe have never taken seriously from the very beginning, Russia hacked our election. \u00a0That was a 9/11 scale event. \u00a0They attacked the core of our democracy. \u00a0That was a Pearl Harbor scale event.\u201d\nHere's how crazy that statement is. \u00a0Say President Trump declared war on Russia as we did after Pearl Harbor, would Thomas Friedman support that?\nOf course not.\nSo this is just madness.\nHowever, the anti-Trump media loves this kinda stuff.\nLet me give you another very simple example, and it has to do with speculation.\nWOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: \u201cDo you think Flynn acted alone when he made that phone call to the Russian ambassador in Washington?\u201d\nREP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA): \u201cI don't think that anything in Washington happens alone.\u201d\nNow that man, Congressman Seth Moulton, is a Trump hater.\nAlso, he has no blanking idea whether General Flynn acted alone. \u00a0He couldn't possibly know that.\nWolf Blitzer, who is generally responsible, asked a speculative question based on nothing.\nThere could not have been any credible answer that shed light on the Flynn situation.\nSo why bother with this nutty speculation?\nThe answer is there are millions of Trump haters who will sit there hour after hour after hour and watch this kind of bilge.\nAnd that's why it's done.\nSumming up, there is no credible evidence at this point that the Trump campaign cooperated with the Russians in the hacking of the Clinton campaign.\nThere is no credible evidence that General Flynn was directed to do anything.\nYet the anti-Trump media is spending hours talking trash.\nOne footnote, hard news reporters should be looking into all the Russian intrusions including the Flynn situation.\nAnd if those reporters uncover evidence of wrongdoing, it should be presented.\nBut speculation by the media is garbage.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "As we reported last night, the national security advisor [Gen.
