The worst: old Bob Beckel.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBOB BECKEL, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: O'Reilly is scared to death of Megyn Kelly because Megyn Kelly has been beating him in ratings. The first time that's happened since it's been -- Fox News Channel has been on the air.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Of course that is absolutely false. False, not true. And that's why Beckel doesn't work here at Fox anymore. He could not care less about facts.\nOn the newspaper side, you know there wasn't anything horrendous. Papers like the \"New York Times\", \"L.A. Times\", \"Washington Post\" -- they don't really care for FNC or Donald Trump. But in this case there weren't any distortions or fabrications, the kind of stuff we see on the left wing Internet sites.\nPerhaps the most interesting analysis was done by Chris Cillizza in the \"Washington Post\". He puts forth that Trump is so far out and ahead that he doesn't need any more debates. So that's why he passed on Iowa. The excuses he made were all smoke. Now, it's impossible to say whether that's true but it's certainly a provocative theory.\nOn the viewer front about 70 percent of the folks thought the interview was worthy; 30 percent hated it.\nSarah Skelton, Yukon, Canada, \"O'Reilly I'm not sure what type of car you drive but I'm guessing there is a Donald Trump bumper sticker on the back.\"\nFrank Richards in Newport News, Virginia, \"Bill thanks for pressing Trump. Based on his tirade against FNC I will have a very difficult time supporting him.\"\nAnna Smith, Appleton, Wisconsin, \"O'Reilly, you claim America wants to get to know Trump. Since when is that your job?\" Well, I believe it's my job to give my opinion, Ann. And that's my opinion.\nJack Faulkner, Climate Falls, Oregon, \"O'Reilly you exposed Trump for what he really is a vindictive person who is not presidential.\"\nNancy Smith, Tucson, Arizona, \"Bill, it is not your job to tell Trump how to run his campaign. He is at least as smart as you think you are.\"\nPam Atkinson, Fluorescent, Colorado, \"Gallant effort, Bill, but Trump cannot be rehabilitated. Narcissists only see their point of view.\"\nPat Hofstether, Elburn Illinois. \"Bill, don't be a pinhead, Trump is right in changing the status quo and not allowing ridiculous questions by debate moderators.\"\nRay Schenk, Rosewell, Georgia, \"Bill, I must compliment you on the Trump interview. You schooled him and he lost his powerful persona as a result of his running away from the debate.\"\nAnd finally Don Newsham, Happy Jack, Arizona. \"Bill, you are a wimp.\"\nSo you can see the Trump interview sparked a tremendous amount of debate across the country. And that's a good thing for America because this man may indeed get the Republican nomination. As I said to him last night, the more folks know about the Trump candidacy the better for the country.\nTalking Points submits to you that most Americans did not know much about Barack Obama. Yes, he was reelected and that is to his credit. His skill campaigning allowed him two terms but did voters really understand really Mr. Obama's governing philosophy? I don't think so.\nSo if Donald Trump, a private businessman his entire career trying to gain enormous power, we the people, have to pay attention. That was the theme of last night's interview.\nBy the way, even if you are calling me names, I appreciate you watching The Factor and taking the time to write in. What I don't appreciate is dishonesty in the media but in truth, I thought I'd see a lot more of it after last night's interview.\nEveryone should understand that many consider FNC the most powerful news agency in the world right now. That leads to an enormous amount of envy.\nFinally for all you one-issue folks, and you know who you are, I have to confess I throw your mail in the garbage not because of your opinion but because fanaticism is boring. I get mail from fanatical feminists, socialists, other extreme folks, presto, it vanishes. Maybe that's wrong, but I simply do not have time for it.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["BOB BECKEL, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: O'Reilly is scared to death of Megyn Kelly because Megyn Kelly has been beating him in ratings.
