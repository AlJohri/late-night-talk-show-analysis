After thinking about it all weekend, I believe I now know why some committed left wingers constantly diminish the terror threat from ISIS and other groups. Before I tell you the reason, I want to spotlight something that happened last week. Congressman Jim Clyburn, very liberal guy from South Carolina put forth an amazing analysis of the Orlando terror attack to which I replied.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLYBURN:</b> This gentleman, it is now being revealed has a lot of hate and it seems that some of it was self-hate and consequently, this is not about ISIS. This is not about any kind of foreign terror. This is about guns in America and whether or not we are going to have some kind of moderation to this Second Amendment just as we have to the First Amendment.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: He gets not about terrorism. It's about gun control. You know, and I just want to slap him with all due respect. You know. What is it going to take? Do the ISIS people have to come to your backyard? All right? Do they have to put you in a cage because they will.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Now, I used a slap line as a rhetorical device to show my displeasure. That was obvious unless you are a complete moron. But the crazy left websites who routinely mislead their readers played it up as an actual physical threat. A few hours later, the Congressional Black Caucus demanded apology. I very politely said to them, come on The Factor, we'll talk about it. I also invited Congressman Clyburn on as well. Guess what? They are hiding under their desks. I guess they are afraid I would slap them. So here's the deal.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>We researched the congressman and we can find no mention of gun control in connection with the Chicago violence. None. This weekend, 13 more people shot to death in the windy city. At least 43 others wounded, including a three-year-old boy that brings the total to 1800 human beings shot so far this year in Chicago. Paging Congressman Clyburn. Come on. If he were truly concerned about guns in America, he would have to say at least something about his fellow African-Americans being shot down in Chicago every single day and it's been going on for years. He would have to say something, would he not?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now, the reason Clyburn brought up guns in connection with Orlando is because the left, in general, doesn't want the American people to focus on the danger from ISIS overseas. That's a Muslim hate group. They don't want to bring Muslims in at all. It doesn't play in to the narrative of the far left who generally believe that America is a source of much of the trouble in the world. We're the problem. So they constantly push a point of view that demonizes the U.S.A. as a bad place, an unfair place. Forget about ISIS. It's all about America. Allowing guns to kill people.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Refocusing the overseas terror problem, on the U.S.A., is a strategy by the far left. Summing up. Thousands of African-Americans being gunned down by other African-Americans in Chicago, which has very, very strict gun control laws. Congressman Clyburn has no comment on that, yet he has plenty to say about guns, not ISIS being the real problem in Orlando. And you make the call. And that's &#8220;The Memo&#8221;.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n\n            \n                \n                    <p><i></i></p>\n                \n                \n\n\n \n\n\t<i></i>\n\n            \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n                          \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t        \r\n\n\t\t\t\t    ", "title": "Bill O'Reilly: Terrorism in the American Left", "description": "'The O'Reilly Factor': Bill O'Reilly's Talking Points 6/20", "date": "2016-06-21T12:02:32Z"}
