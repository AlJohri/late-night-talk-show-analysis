Let me say this. I had spoken to the attorney general, the governor and the mayor in the last 12 hours. All of them are in agreement, and the governor I think is prepared to make an executive order to get special prosecutors in cases like these.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: I don't have a problem with that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>SIMMONS</b>: Right, of course.

I said on this air that I was disturbed by what happened in the Staten Island case. So did Charles Krauthammer. So did Judge Napolitano. All Americans should be disturbed. But the bigger issue that you're not acknowledging is the astronomical crime rate among young black men, violent crime drives suspicion and hostility on the part of the police who have to be confronted with it. You won't acknowledge it, Russell, you won't acknowledge it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>SIMMONS</b>: Let me say this to you, broken glass laws and the way the police approach community is a problem.

The 95 percent of the people who go to jail for nonviolent first time offenses are people of color.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Is selling heroin and crack on the street a violent crime?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>SIMMONS</b>: What I am saying is that whites and blacks use --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: That's an easy question.
