Last September President Obama called Yemen a success story in fighting the war on terror. Obviously things have changed.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Tunisia -- authorities have arrested more than 20 suspected terrorists after 23 people were massacred in the capital city of Tunis.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>In Libya, terrorists affiliated with ISIS are battling to control the country because there is no central authority there.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Syria, ISIS controls thousands of square miles trying to depose the Assad regime. More than 200,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And finally in Iraq, at least 19 people were killed today after three separate terror bombs exploded in Baghdad. That country is now seeing fighting between ISIS and Iranian-backed militias -- total chaos in Iraq.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So you can see that President Obama's policy of non-engagement in the Middle East is a disaster. Tomorrow, the President meets with the President of Afghanistan who is pleading with him to leave a substantial American force in that country in order to keep the Taliban terrorists from taking over. Mr. Obama is expected to grant that request.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now, in the waging of any war, you must have a strategy. And that's the problem. There is no strategy to fight ISIS, al Qaeda and other jihadist groups. Once again, the President points to a phantom coalition of 60 countries which exists only on paper.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Last month, Secretary of State John Kerry was confronted with the dismal situation.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS HOST:</b> Are we winning right now? Are we actually winning in our goal of diminishing and eventually destroying ISIS?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>JOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF TATE:</b> Well, I believe we are on the road to. Yes, I absolutely do. And I think the evidence is not in my saying it but it's in the facts of what is happening.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> But Mr. Kerry is living in a dream world if he thinks that ISIS and the other jihadists are close to being defeated.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And so the President has only Iran as a possible victory. The deadline for the latest nuclear weapons negotiation is next week. Mr. Obama wants the framework of a deal -- no question about it. But the Iranians understand they have the stronger bargaining position. With the war on terror raging almost out of control in the Middle East, if President Obama doesn't get a deal with the mullahs, he will look like a total failure.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>To be fair, the President inherited a very messy situation from President Bush. But there is no question that Mr. Obama has made the situation worse by a series of tactical blunders including removing all U.S. troops from Iraq.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>How on earth ISIS could gain incredible power without President Obama doing anything about it at all is almost impossible to believe. The JV comment will haunt the President forever.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So now it's time for the Obama administration to admit what's happening and to finally get a strategy to defeat the jihadists. And that's the memo.
