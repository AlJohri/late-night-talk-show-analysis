JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:</b> Lucifer in the flesh. In Washington, I have as many Democrat friends as I have Republican friends. I get along with almost everybody but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a (bleep). Over my dead body will he be president.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Now, Mr. Boehner does not like Cruz because of the Senator's unwillingness to compromise over the budget and other issues. The problem here is this. Boehner is a sniper. We invited the Speaker on the program tonight. He turned us down, as always. If you're going to smear someone, Mr. Speaker, at least submit yourself to questioning. In order to provide some perspective. Talking Points does not respect backstabbing. If you have a beef, state it, back it up. Boehner was wrong not in saying what he said is entitled to his opinion. But in a sneaky way he did it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Second thing on my mind, Will Ferrell very successful actor, comedian, was apparently about to do a satire that included mocking Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's condition. Front page in the \"New York Post\" today and variety is also reporting that Ferrell agree to do produce and star in a movie called \"Reagan\" which deals with the President's dementia. Recently, there was a reading of the script and there was a lot of denigration of the late president. The movie, thus far, is unsold and I believe it will remain so because now Will Ferrell has pulled out of project after getting hammered in the court ever public opinion.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now, I know a lot about this because I am an executive producer of the upcoming movie \"Killing Reagan\" based on my book. We are currently in preproduction. The film is set to air on the National Geographic Channel this coming October. I am very involved with the script, making sure Ronald Reagan is treated with respect and fairness. That's how he is treated in my book. And that's how he will be treated in the movie. Even though we will tell the truth about the President. As for Ferrell, if he had gone ahead with the dopey film, he would have put his career on the line. While satirizing people in a good thing in a vibrant democracy, cruelty is not.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Will Ferrell is an uber liberal guy again not a problem unless his zealotry crosses the lines of decency. Dementia is not something you treat lightly. Nor is the legacy of a president many consider to be a patriot.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Number three, the continuing chaos outside political rallies that Donald Trump is holding.

Blocking a major intersection. Making the distaste for Trump loud and clear with one particular unbroadcastable anti-Trump slogan repeated again and again among other shouts and chants.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(CHANTING)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But what had been a protest in the First Amendment tradition morphed into something much darker. Police donning riot gear, protesters becoming more threatening. A bottle was thrown at police lions, rocks hurled. A patrolled car's rear window smashed the vehicle then stomped. The crowds had stopped traffic on several streets. Among the vehicles trapped, one driven by a Trump supporter who got out of his car and then emerged from the crowd with a bloody face. The police ordered the crowd to disperse. They didn't.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Many of them seemingly more intent on taking selfies than taking part in political protests. Arrests began to be made. And eventually the police and sheriff's deputies began pushing back the crowd. In all, there were more than a dozen arrests as the police appeared to focus on containment, rather than confrontation. But what was, perhaps, most remarkable here was that this all happened at a presidential campaign rally. A measure of the passions of this extraordinary political season. But a sign, too of how easily those passions can and might damage rather than dignify democracy.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>In Costa Mesa, California, Jonathan Hunt, FOX News.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEOTAPE)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>All right. Thanks to Mr. Hunt for that excellent report. Now, the continuing anti-Trump shenanigans actually helped the candidate. When Americans see people destroying police cars and generally behaving in untoward way, they don't like those people. Their actions are undemocratic. And actually provide sympathy for the person they dislike in this case Donald Trump. Many of these protesters are so stupid, they can't understand that. But it's the truth. Once a movement is considered harmful by the folks, once that is established, anyone opposed to that movement gets a positive shine.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Best example, Richard Nixon versus George McGovern in 1972. The violent demonstrations against Nixon actually propelled him to a landslide victory even though the man himself was not generally liked. So, you pinheads wrecking cop cars and spraying your political opponents with chemicals, might want to consider that.
