The vulgar tape and the wall to wall reporting of it had the Republican candidate in a very bad place. But Trump somehow against all odds won the debate. He won because Secretary Clinton could not knock him out and after the first 30 minutes, Trump went on offense, regaining at least some momentum. Here's how it went down. The debate opened with no hand shake. Then, Secretary Clinton fired the first round.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON:</b> What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women and he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is. But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. But it's not only women and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president. Because he has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, P.O.W.s, Muslims and so many others.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Trump answered with a strategy he has used before.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women. And attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old was raped at 12.

Counselor Clinton was successful in raising doubt and Taylor pled out to unlawful fondling of a child. Serving just one year in jail. The victim, Kathy Shelton appeared with Donald Trump in a press conference just prior to the debate saying the way Mrs. Clinton treated her when she was 12-years-old damaged her for life. Trump then pounded home the theme that Mrs. Clinton's past record makes her a hypocrite on the woman abuse issue.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: When Hillary brings up the point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Mrs. Clinton jumped on that saying that Trump is never contrite.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON</b>: He never apologizes for anything to anyone.
