New Monmouth poll out today as Secretary Clinton up by seven points. But this goes day to day up and down.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Joining us now from inside headquarters, here in in New York City is Donald Trump. So, where do you think you are in the race? I don't think if you guys are doing internal polling yet. But do you think you are ahead, behind, tied? Where are you?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:</b> I think it's very close. I think that probably one poll came out. I'm pretty much even. I just tonight know. It's very early to have polling. I think we haven't even gotten started yet. You know, I'm just literally just starting. And I view the convention as probably a real starting point. But I think it's pretty even from what I'm seeing.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Okay. Now, you are taking some incoming from the insinuation that Barack Obama may be sympathetic to Muslim terrorists. We talked about this a little recently on this program. I don't think you believe that he is a quisling. That is he someone who wants Islamic terrorism to prosper. You don't believe that do you?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: I don't believe it. I do say though when I see a deal like was made with Iran, this horrible, horrible deal where we are giving them back $150 billion. To the best of my knowledge and I will tell you what, I've studied that thing pretty closely. We're getting almost nothing out of it. They will going to end up with nuclear weapons and lots of other things, whatever they want. And then I see the way he treats Israel.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>I say wow, what's the -- there seems to be a double standard. I'm not happy about it. A lot of other people aren't happy about it. I can tell you the people in Israel are not happy about it. So, I look at things and I see what's going on. I'm a common sense person. And I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it one bit.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Well, the Iranian deal is geopolitics. And he believes that he is going to keep Iran from getting the nuclear device but we will see down the road.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> It's not going to happen.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> But your insinuation after Orlando is a little bit more personal than that. I remember the background because you are a birther guy, you didn't believe or you questioned his birth certificate where he was born. And now you are saying in so many words and I don't want to put words in your mouth so you can clarify that look, there is something more here than just President Obama seeing the world in a non-confrontational way. There might be a personal agent here. Is that on your mind?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: Well, it bothers me when is he afraid or doesn't want to mention the words radical Islamic terrorism when, obviously --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: But he says it doesn't do any good to do that. It doesn't influence his policy.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> I disagree with him. And then they, you know, they redact a lot of the different statements made by this thug, this horrible guy that killed all those people. And, you know, it's a disgraceful thing. So, I disagree. You know, if you have a problem you have to be able to speak openly about the problem. This is a real problem. This is worldwide.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Sure. Sure. And that's the difference between you and not only President Obama but Hillary Clinton who's, you know, you brought her a little bit more. But you are kind of dodging my question and you don't usually do that. You believe there is a personal component inside the President's personality that sympathizes with the Muslim world and doesn't want to take the Muslim world with terrorism? Is that what it's about?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: I don't believe anything. I see things and whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's not wanting to mention the words radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism or other things, Bill. You look at what's going on. I mean, it's not a question of what I think. But you look at facts. This isn't -- this isn't thinking. This is facts.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: I know but you got a motive.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> And I really believe this. Bill, I really believe it. No, I have no motive.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Not your motive, I'm talking about his motive.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: If he were a great, let me tell you something. If he were a great president, a great, great president, and you know that's not going to happen. I would be so thrilled if our real employment was at five percent or four percent or three percent. I would be so thrilled. But it's not. Our country is in a horrible position in so many ways whether it's manufacturing, which is just -- our companies are fleeing our country with jobs. You look at what's going on with this country. It's really sad.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> All right. All right.

And I look at what he doesn't say. Why isn't he willing -- how do you solve a problem if you are unwilling to discuss it or unwilling to name it. And now she is all of the sudden, wait a minute, Bill.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> All right. He says -- he'll drop the drones on them. He'll do what he has to do. But okay.

But we have to have a very precise thing about, if you are on a terror watch list, this is what you can and can't do. What about the big guns? All right?

I get along. I get along very well with the NRA on most of these subjects. I think probably the one is that when you are on a terror watch list. Perhaps in a certain sense my stance is tougher than anybody. But when you are on terror watch list you are on. You don't get to get a gun. And basically, they are right. And they're right. No, no, they're right. There are mistakes. And by the way, there are many, many mistakes on those watch lists. And what I would do, frankly is work hard to eradicate the mistakes --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Yes.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: To make sure that this people get off the list --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(CROSSTALK)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Congress is going to have to pass a law that has exact wording.

I was actually surprise to do see that. I saw it two or three weeks ago where they show me laws. I mean, if we obey the laws that are already in existence. If we follow those laws already in existence, you have pretty good rights.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Okay.

I'm pretty sure the earliest endorsement they have ever given to a presidential candidate. I have stayed with what they have been saying. And I will tell you what, Bill, these people Wayne and Chris, I think they get a bad rap. They are great Americans. They love our country. This is what they do.
