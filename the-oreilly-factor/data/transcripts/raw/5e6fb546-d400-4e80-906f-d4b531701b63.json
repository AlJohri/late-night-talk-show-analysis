That's because my ancestors were working people. Firefighters, cops, teachers, laborers. And back then the Democrats fought to get working people more money. So, it was natural for my folks to embrace that party.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Well now we have a different situation in America. While the Democrats still promote themselves as friendly to working people, they often pander to big labor and extremists on the social front. Enter Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders who debated last night in Brooklyn. Mrs. Clinton came off as more presidential than Senator Sanders because she knows more about the world. But she did have a few rough moments.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>DANA BASH, CNN CORRESPONDENT</b>: The question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON</b>: I have said, look there are certain expectations when you run for president.

Secretary Clinton does not want us to know what she said in her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs. Period. And for the record, Bernie Sanders never gave any speeches to fat cats so there is nothing for him to release. And the phrase when everybody does it, I will, come on. If Hillary Clinton is going to portray herself as a warrior against Wall Street excess, and she has to tell us what she said to Goldman Sachs, correct?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now, the other issues last night were fairly predictable. Both candidates want few limits on abortion. They say that White privilege is a major problem in America. They want income redistribution. It's a litany of the liberal playbook. Here was the most raucous moment and it involves the minimum wage.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON</b>: If we can</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(CROSSTALK)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON</b>: -- raise it to $15 in New York --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(CROSSTALK)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON</b>: -- or Los Angeles or Seattle --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BLITZER</b>: Secretary, the viewers --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON</b>: -- let's do it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>SANDERS</b>: And suddenly --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR</b>: Secretary, go ahead.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>SANDERS</b>: To suddenly --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON:</b> Thank you.

Yes, the minimum wage should be raised in America. No one can live on seven bucks an hour. And for those of you who say it will hurt business, so what? It has to be some kind of fairness in capitalism. Also, if the minimum wage were, say, 11 bucks an hour nationwide, that would give folks an incentive to get into the workforce, which is what we want. And you can phase it in.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>By 2025 for example, the minimum wage should be 15 bucks an hour in this country. But Bernie Sanders in particular should know the higher the minimum wage is, the fewer jobs there will be. Also, prices will go up in places like Costco and Wal-Mart where working Americans shop. Sanders and the Democratic Party seem to forget all that. You raise wages across the board, some businesses are going to cut back and prices will rise. And there is nothing Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton can do about it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So, in the end, the Democrats are hoping to hold the other coalition of Liberal Americans, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and voters below the age of 30 who may not be as informed as they might be. No political party is perfect. But right now Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders are running very far left campaigns. No question about it.
