Talking Points said that last night, and it has been a major theme of this program for years.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Unfortunately, most western leaders are afraid to do that. Pointing to the debacle in Iraq and the tremendous problems in Afghanistan as a reason to avoid meaningful confrontation with Islamic killers. But, if we do not attack the savages, the world will continue to absorb violent terror incidents. They will never stop. Enter Hillary Clinton, who might become president. Today at Stanford University she spoke about the ISIS threat.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON: </b>On 9/11, NATO treated an attack against one as an attack against all. On September 12th, headlines across Europe, most notably in Ramon, proclaimed we are all Americans. Now it's our turn to stand with Europe.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> What is that mean? Stand with Europe? We analyzed Mrs. Clinton's speech today and can find no concrete action. She is proposing to defeat the ISIS savages. Nothing. Instead, she used her platform to attack Republicans.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON</b>: It would also be a serious mistake to begin carpet bombing populated areas into oblivion. Proposing that doesn't make you sound tough. It makes you sound like you are in over your head. Slogans aren't a strategy.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>On that, Hillary Clinton and I agree. Slogans are no strategy. But, again, what is her strategy to stop the terror killings plaguing the world? What is it? If Talking Points hears about alliances one more time, cardiac arrest may follow. Let's stop the b.s., people are dying. Innocent people. ISIS is like the black plague marching through Europe killing at random. There's a report today that 400 terrorists have been dispatched by ISIS to cause damage in Europe. The solution to defeating Islamic terrorism lies in bruit force. Not dumb suggestions that the Kurds handle the whole thing. That kind of blather.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>America needs a strong leader who will sit down with the smartest military people and map out a clear fighting plan. Then, NATO needs to declare war on the ISIS group. Then every Muslim nation in the world needs to be asked to pledge troops to help NATO fight ISIS. No more dithering, no more sloganeering, because, and mark my words here, a weapon of mass destruction will be used by the ISIS savages. It is just a matter of time.
