As you may remember a man in New Hampshire asked Mr. Trump some questions about Muslims which he did not answer directly. That caused the media to go nuts.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</b>: In a country that is very armed, that will be carrying weapon will go to a mosque tomorrow or after tomorrow and will start shooting people.

Rejoining us now from New York City Donald Trump. What do you say to that? Somebody shoots up a mosque you are responsible.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: Well, I think it's terrible what is going on. I can tell you in New York City they used to go in and check and do a lot of different things and now they are not doing any checking and I think frankly the question that was asked of me in New Hampshire which was a packed house and a lot of enthusiasm, I just didn't want to respond to the question.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And it's the first time I have ever been sort of made controversial by not responding to a question. But they wanted me to defend President Obama and he can defend himself. I don't have to defend Obama.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Ok. But I mean look, the media is not going to give you a fair shake and they are just not. That brings us to me --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: That's true.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>01: -- me and you.

But I think it's certainly fair. I think that you know, as you know, I'm leading every poll and most polls I'm leading very big in New Hampshire, in Iowa. If you look at what just came down, South Carolina the polls -- all number one. So I can't be so doing so badly.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But it's not going to be a question of nice. I think I'm a nice person. I have great relationships. You know me well. I help people, I love people. But it's not going to be a question of that. It's going to be a question of competence because people are tired of being pushed around by every country in the world.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> And that's why you're doing well. You have to be kind of presidential. I'm going to run a clip now of something you recently said and then I'm going to ask you another question which may be unfair. If it is you tell me. Roll the tape.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: You have this clown Marco Rubio.

I was getting along with him perfectly fine two weeks ago. Everything was fine. I don't really know him. And then all of a sudden he attacks me about nothing. But really attacked me quite viciously and I fought back. I told people that he has one of the worst voting records. He has the worst voting record in the senate. He never shows up. I mean he's not going in for votes and that, you can't do.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>He is weak on immigration. Unbelievably weak on immigration. And I'm all about strong on illegal immigration and other things. So I mentioned it and I said it loudly. But again, I'm a counter puncher.
