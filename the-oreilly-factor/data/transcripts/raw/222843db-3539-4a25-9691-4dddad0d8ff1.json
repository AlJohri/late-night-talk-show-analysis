The President, not giving the new Congress, not giving the new Congress time to put together an immigration bill. That's insulting to the new Congress, which begins in January. Already the Republican Party is unified in opposition to the President's unilateral action.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And so there will be consequences. For example, in early December, Congress is supposed to pass the spending bill which might very well be blocked in the house paralyzing the government and there are a number of other things the Republican Party may do to punish the President for his executive order.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>All of this terrible for the country and Mr. Obama has to know that. But he doesn't seem to care. Surely he could have waited a few months and lobbied for what he believes is a just immigration compromise, but no, the President, seething over the election results has decided to tear the country apart, politically.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:</b> Under the Constitution, only the Congress can rewrite the law.
