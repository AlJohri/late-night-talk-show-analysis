According to the Census Bureau in 2012, the most recent stats, almost 110 million Americans lived in a home receiving government assistance, apart from Social Security and Medicare, which is earned. That's about a third of the population and a historically high number including the great depression.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>When citizens become dependent on government to live day to day, that weakens the entire nation. Prosperity is a key component to a strong country. But prosperity in the U.S.A. is on the decline. As median income has fallen more than 3 percent under President Obama. Wages are the key to personal independence. And wages are not increasing.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Remember, America was built on hard work, not government safety nets. There was no welfare or government assistance when this country was founded. You either made it or you didn't.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Today many of us have a sense of entitlement, that's eroding our well- being. Millions of Americans now depend on elected officials for their security. That leads to vote buying and corruption. Being self-sufficient makes you stronger. Being dependent makes you weaker.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>The welfare state that liberal America champions has brought power to the Democratic Party, no doubt but it's also created massive debt and sapped personal initiative. In just a few moments, Jesse Watters will talk to some Americans who are just hanging around all day, doing little with their lives.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Bottom line, Americans' foreign policy weak; America's domestic policy heading in the wrong direction very quickly.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And that's &#8220;The Memo&#8221;.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n\n            \n                \n                    <p><i></i></p>\n                \n                \n\n\n \n\n            \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n                          \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t        \r\n\n\t\t\t\t    ", "title": "Bill O'Reilly: The Decline of American Power, part 2", "description": "Bill O'Reilly's Talking Points 5/28", "date": "2015-05-29T12:21:06Z"}
