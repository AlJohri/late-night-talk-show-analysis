Recently The Factor reported on Boston University Professor Saida Grundy who is openly anti-white. Ms. Grundy has put together a number of tweets saying things like, quote, \"Dear white people, you are all Ben Affleck. I'm not. Those euphemisms for your ancestors like farmers and pioneers means owned humans and killed natives.\"</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Then there is Rashid Khalidi, Columbia University since 2003. Dr. Khalidi's escorted the New York Sun as saying, \"A Palestinians have a right, a legal right to murder civilians. Killing civilians is a war crime whoever does it but resistance to occupation is legitimate in international law.\" So if civilians die in resistance like lobbing rockets into Israel it's fine with the doctor.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>With us now FOX News correspondent Shannon Bream and Eric Shawn.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So, how do these really radical people actually get hired?

It goes into effect in July unless they change it and it looks like the Senate there in Kansas has gotten so much heat that they are willing to change and say maybe there's going to be some flexibility in that. Because they say, if people have to pay a charge fee like dollar fee every time they take out money, it could be a big chunk.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> All right.
