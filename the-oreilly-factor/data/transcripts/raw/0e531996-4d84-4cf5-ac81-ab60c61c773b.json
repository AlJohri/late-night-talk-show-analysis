And the reason he did it from the Senate floor was because he couldn't be sued. Specifically.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Well, that's interesting.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TANTAROS: </b>Yes. I discovered that today. I have been reading the constitution and the rules of the Senate. That's why he did it, Bill. He said those words because he couldn't be sued for libel. And it was flat out lie. And he was not mincing words. He was very clear. It was gossip it was hearsay. Remember he talked to a friend of a friend in Mormon circles who worked at Bain.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Sure. But even if he believed it at that time, Jessica, I have to come back to you, shouldn't he have now acknowledged that, look, I'm sorry I said that, it didn't turn out to be true. I probably should have used other words. Wouldn't that be the quality person who would say? I'm interested in the quality of Harry Reid here.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>EHRLICH:</b> I don't disagree with you on that on either side.

Because he comes across as a slimy weasel with his dark glasses saying CNN he doesn't regret it and Romney lost so that justifies him misleading the entire country and using his powerful position, position that President Obama knowing what he did still continues to praise. This is disturbing to me as an American. I don't care about political parties as you guys know. This is disturbing. I don't want that kind of quality there.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TANTAROS: </b>It is disturbing. And what's also disturbing is that at the time he did it so that Mitt Romney's taxes would be injected in the presidential debate. Now, look, did Mitt Romney handle that well? Not really because he didn't release his taxes right away. However, what this did, Bill, was he providing the media with a story line where they were able to say and they reported it as fact which you would never go, they floated gossip and hearsay as a real report even though it was unsubstantiated report.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>But I must say we did very very stringent research on that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TANTAROS:</b> I did too.
