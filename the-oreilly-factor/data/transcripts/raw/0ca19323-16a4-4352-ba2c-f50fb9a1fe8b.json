But not enough progress to vanquish the Jihad or even dent their murderous swagger. The President and the American left, they have a good measure of responsibility for not annihilating terror threats that are ongoing and have changed our way of life. Here are the facts. The left opposes a declaration of war against radical Islamic organizations. They oppose the Patriot Act, which gives U.S. intelligence agencies more tools to blunt attacks.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>The left opposes tough border security measures. In fact, some in that crew even want open borders. Many on the left would not even support Kate's Law which quickly and harshly punishes violent foreigners who defy deportation. And, perhaps, the greatest hypocrisy of all. Instead of demanding strong punishment for criminals and terrorists who use guns, the left stands silent and so does Mr. Obama. All they want is to obliterate the Second Amendment, which was put into the constitution to give us the right to protect ourselves from bad people. It's the guns, not the terror threat that really move the left.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>WHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-HOST OF \"THE VIEW\": </b>All you people on twitter that like to come after folks, back up.

It is his job to lead the world against the jihadi. By not even spelling out the precise danger, by using substitute wording for Islamic terrorism, he is sending a message that it's not really the fault of the Muslim world that this atrocious jihadist campaign has taken root. It's not really their fault. But here's the truth. If all the good Muslims in the world would unite against the jihadi, it would be wiped out in weeks. Are we clear?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now, the right wing responsibility. There is too much gun crime in the U.S.A. And high powered weaponry is too easy to get. That's the fact. So let's deal with it. We all have the right to bear arms. But we don't have the right to buy and maintain mortars. Even if you feel threatened by gangsters or a new world order. No bazookas, no Sherman tanks, no hand grenades. That's because the Second Amendment clearly states the government has a right to regulate militias, made up of individuals. They have that right in the name of public safety.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Therefore, Congress should debate what kind of weapons should be available for public sale. And the states, the individual states should decide what kind of carry laws are good for their own people. New laws are definitely needed in the age of terrorism and mass murder. The FBI and other federal agencies need the power to stop suspected terrorists or other evil doers from buying weapons, that law needs to be very precise. Also gun dealers all across America should be required to report the sale of certain kinds of guns heavy weapons directly to the FBI.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Not handguns, not talking about that but other weapons that would be defined by Congress. That is a sane approach and would make it a lot tougher for the Omar Mateens of the world to get the weaponry to kill. Although as talking points has stated many, many times, no society will ever stop all gun crimes, especially in a country which has hundreds of millions of guns already in circulation.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now back to ISIS. According to a study by the Rand Corporation. The number of Sunni jihadist Muslims doubled between 2010 and 2013. The prime years of President Obama's pull back or retreat in Iraq in the Middle East. Just since 2014, more than 1,000 human beings have been murdered by ISIS outside of their base areas in Syria and Iraq. While President Obama is content with wearing ISIS down and outsourcing the direct fight to others, that strategy is clearly leading to more death and disruptions all over the planet. But the left will not see that this is a war worth fighting.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>STEPHEN COLBERT, CBS ANCHOR:</b> After 9/11, we went to war in Iraq.

Forty nine percent say, the U.S.A. is weaker since Mr. Obama took office. Forty percent stronger. Summing up, the Islamic jihad has declared war on America and the West.
