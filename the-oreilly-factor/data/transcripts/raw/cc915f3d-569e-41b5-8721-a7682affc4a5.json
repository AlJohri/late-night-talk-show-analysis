In the \"Personal Story\" segment tonight, while campaigning at a diner in Manchester, New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton apparently told a story about how she attempted to join the marines after she moved to Arkansas in 1975. According to Mrs. Clinton, a recruiter turned her down.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: </b>He looks at me and he goes, how old are you? And I said, well, I'm 26. I will be 27. And he goes well, that's kind of old for us.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(LAUGHTER)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And then he says to me.

Their conclusion is the story doesn't add up because there is no documentation. However, the newspaper did locate friends of Mrs. Clinton who back up her contention she tried to join the marines.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>With us now Jessica Tarlov, democratic strategist and from Cleveland Capri Cafaro, democratic state senator from Ohio.

The most powerful and most important job in the world. So, he needs to expect to have this level of scrutiny and, yes --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Okay. But Hillary Clinton is running for president, too. I mean, I'm just trying, in your opinion, it's the same thing, isn't it?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CAFARO: </b>And you are covering this story.

And 1975, you know, she said she tried to join the marines. The post is skeptical and now, Jessica, we have a mini situation on our hands.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>JESSICA TARLOV, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:</b> Mini.

This is the woman at every piece of her life investigated.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> And I don't know why they gave her any Pinocchios, Senator.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CAFARO:</b> But I certainly, I mean, I agree with what Jessica was saying that I mean, Secretary Clinton has been under the hot light of scrutiny, most of her adult life. From Watergate to Benghazi or excuse me -- from white water to Benghazi, here is a woman whose life has been on display and this should be no surprise to her. I do think though that it is a little bit sexist, if I may say so myself. You know, we're not hearing anything about any of the male candidates who are of the --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Who tried to join the marines?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CAFARO:</b> Well, but we are not hearing about any of the male candidates.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> But the male candidates aren't discussing it?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CAFARO: </b>Not signing up for Vietnam.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Well, wait, you know, they talked about Vietnam then you could say that. It's got to be contextual. It's not sexist to investigate whether Hillary Clinton did or did not try to sign up for the marines. That's what journalists are supposed to do.
