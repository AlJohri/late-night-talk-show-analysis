Thank you for watching us tonight.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So we have a big story going on as Donald Trump says he will not participate in the Fox News Republican debate tomorrow evening in Iowa.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>His reason seems to be Fox News anchor and debate moderator, Megyn Kelly, who Mr. Trump believes is not treating him fairly.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But, candidates often feel that way about journalists and news organizations can't allow any outside person to dictate coverage.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Tonight, I will forego the traditional talking points memo so we can hear from Mr. Trump extensively. But I will say this to begin our reporting. America is not in a good place these days. Almost 70 percent of adults agree with that statement. We need strong leadership to revive the country. Donald Trump is leading in the Republican polling because he is perceived to be a strong leader by many. However, Americans are still taking their measure, Mr. Trump.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Tonight, we will concentrate on issues, not personal stuff. Mr. Trump joins us now from Florida.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So I appreciate your coming on. Most politicians would have dodged this interview, but I have to tell you something, I don't think not showing up at the debate tomorrow night is good for America. Voters are still assessing you. They need to see you in high-profile situations. Or am I wrong?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> Well, I think you're wrong because, frankly, when you're mistreated as we were with the Iran deal, that our country should have walked, Secretary Kerry, President Obama should have walked from that deal, you would have made a much better deal.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>I was not treated well by Fox. They came out with this ridiculous P.R. statement, it was like drawn up by a child. And there was a taunt. And I said, you know, \"How much of this do you take?\" I have zero respect for Megyn Kelly. I don't think she's very good at what she does. I think she's highly overrated. And, frankly, she's the moderator.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>I thought her question last time was ridiculous. And everybody said ...</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: All right, well, wait, wait, wait ...</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: ...the debate. In fact, everybody said -- well, everybody said, I won all six debates and especially the last one. So, I don't mind debating. In fact, I actually like debating.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Let's look at it from a broader point of view rather than how you feel. You're running for president. I believe you want to improve the country. I believe that personally, all right, as an American that you want to improve the country.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>By doing this, all right, you lose an opportunity to convince others, who may put you into the White House that indeed is true. You have, in this debate format, the upper hand. You have 60 seconds right off the top to tell any of the moderators, \"You're a pinhead, your question is unfair and here's why and here's what I want to say.\"</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>By walking away from it, you lose an opportunity to persuade people that you are a strong leader. That's my opinion.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> Well, I understand your opinion, Bill. But tomorrow night at 9:00 at Drake University, we're going to have a tremendous event and I'll have much more than 60 seconds, frankly. And we're going to raise a lot of money for the veterans. A lot of money is going to be raised. A lot of people are going to be there, and I can do some good.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And frankly, I think that's good ...</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Fox could do that any day.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: ...make a fortune on this debate.

But, Fox is going to make a lot of money on the debate.

CNN, likewise, broke its all-time record with 23 million people. I just don't like being used. And when they issued that tweet or whatever it was that Fox issued, I guess it was a press release ...</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Listen, Donald, I got it, I got it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: ...it was like done by children.

Newt Gingrich, four years ago, pretty much on a dime was in a CNN interview, you may remember this, in South Carolina. And he was treated much worse, much worse than you have ever been treated by anybody. Because they brought up that a he said, she said, John King, the moderator, about an ex-wife that was tawdry, disrespectful, should never have been in the debate.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Gingrich knew it was coming, and Gingrich let King and CNN have it. And the result was he won the new -- the South Carolina primary by a lot. And people gained a lot of respect for him.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So, you saw Gingrich tested. And, the folks liked what he did. And I'm telling you, that's the way to go here. If they treated you unfairly, and I don't believe they would, I don't believe the three moderators would treat you unfairly tomorrow night, then you got 60 seconds to let them have it right between you guys. And that's the kind of guy you are. You stand up. You let them have it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: Well, first of all, Newt is a friend of mine. I thought he did great.
