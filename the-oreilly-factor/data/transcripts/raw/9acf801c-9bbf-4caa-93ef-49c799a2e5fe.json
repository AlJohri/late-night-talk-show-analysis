The headline is both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump expose themselves politically last night. American voters who are paying attention now know exactly where the candidates stand. The back and forth on abortion is the best example.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: If you go with what Hillary is saying in the 9th month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, can you say that that's okay? And Hillary can say that that's okay. But it's not okay with me.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON: </b>I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.

As we saw in Kansas and in Pennsylvania, the health of the mother could be anything. There are corrupt doctors who will abort for money on the most flimsy of physical excuses. In a humane country, the unborn must be protected to some extent by the government. Otherwise, we don't have any moral authority on anything. Next up, illegal immigration.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>WALLACE:</b> Is that your dream, open borders?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON:</b> Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy, you know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Chris Wallace citing the WikiLeaks hack showing Secretary Clinton saying to a bunch of Brazilian bankers, quote, \"My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.

Mrs. Clinton supports people moving freely in this hemisphere as they do right now in Western Europe. That is the truth.
