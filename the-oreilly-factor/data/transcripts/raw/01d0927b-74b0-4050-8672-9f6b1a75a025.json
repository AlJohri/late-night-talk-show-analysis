As you may know that group has conducted a number of stings on Planned Parenthood executives who offered to sell baby body parts after an abortion. The latest, a sting in Houston of Melissa Farrell who discusses selling the entire cadaver of an unborn baby.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>FARRELL:</b> Yes, and so if we alter our process.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And we are able to obtain intact fetal cadavers, then we can make it part of the budget, that any dissections are this and splitting specimens into different shipments is this. I mean that's all just a matter of line items.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Babies are line items now to that woman.

This is an all-out effort to build support to take away a woman's right to control her own body.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Yes, that would be a good voting strategy. Alienate all- American women. Senator Warren not mentioning the trafficking in body parts. Maybe she just forgot. How dishonest is Miss Warren?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>With us now here in New York City, Monica Crowley; and from Washington, Kirsten Powers -- both are Fox News analysts.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>I want you to react to Senator Warren, all right? I don't know the woman.

So she clearly knows what's in play here. She is clearly politicizing this while ignoring the central issue of the sale and harvesting of dead unborn fetuses or babies, depending on your belief system. What about Senator Warren?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> Well, I mean look, she obviously -- she is reading from something. I would love to know who gave that to her. She sounds just like Cecile Richards who is the head of Planned Parenthood. She is making the same argument they have been making, this is the war on women which anybody who has watched these videos this is not what this is about.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>What Senator Warren said is absolutely false. This is not about whether abortions should be legal or not be legal. That's not the debate that's being had at all. That's the debate she would like to be having because that's one that she feels can gin up her supporters. But that's not the actual debate that's happening.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Well, let's get right down to it. This is a Harvard professor who became a Senator in Massachusetts. You are absolutely right. You defined it absolutely the way it is. It's not about depriving American women of abortions or anything else. So Warren knows what it's about. Yet, goes out to try to deceive.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Am I wrong in saying that?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS: </b>No. You are not wrong.

So she is a deceiver.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS: </b>Yes. It's not just her.

So then can we respect a deceiver?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> I mean certainly -- look some people go out -- I would call it lying. It's not -- I mean look -- but that's what's going on.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> I don't want to use that word because I think deceiver is more accurate.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> People are really going out and giving out extremely false information. So if you want to call it deceiver, fine. There is nothing about this that is about taking away a woman's right to choose. Nothing about even the defunding Planned Parenthood bill has nothing to do with taking a way a woman's right to choose or even taking away a woman's health care. It's just not true.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>No, defunding Planned Parenthood basically throws it into the private sector where it should be anyway.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So Senator Warren, all right,. the voice now of the progressive left, somebody that Hillary Clinton fears, all right. She is a deceiver. You agree with that right?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS ANALYST: </b>Yes.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>She is deceiving?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CROWLEY: </b>Yes.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> So what are we to think of her?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CROWLEY:</b> Well, look, I think what she represents is the party at large in terms of their position on abortion.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> No. But what about her?

And it's not -- I agree with Kirsten. It's not just her. It's what she and her movement represent. For them abortion is such a pure article of faith that nothing, not even these horrendous videos are going to change their position on it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>So are you saying that there isn't any such thing as truth for Senator Warren that she doesn't care about it or doesn't know about it?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CROWLEY:</b> For her on this issue, I think that's right.
