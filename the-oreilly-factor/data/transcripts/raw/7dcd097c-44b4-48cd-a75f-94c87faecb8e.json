The first one is there is no deep end for Trump. And I don't know, Matt, you have got to get out of the D.C. bubble a little bit.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>The level of disgust in America right now at the cesspool in Washington, D.C. just because you don't see the pitch forks doesn't mean the disgust isn't out there. People feel like they are being ruled not governed. And they see Trump as just anti-what everything they hate about D.C. is.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And secondly the most biting attacks out there in politics are the ones that already fit a preexisting narrative. Here is the narrative about Mrs. Clinton. She is an elitist from inside the D.C. bubble. She couldn't even make it back on time from a bathroom break. This is a bigger deal than it seems on its face. And good for Trump for hitting her on it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOLLING:</b> Matthew, I'm guessing, I don't know this, but I think he was trying to say shellacked which means took a beating in '08, but you know something else slipped out -- whatever. Things happen.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>LITTMAN:</b> First of all -- well, good for you to try to figure out what Trump means, good luck, number one. Number two, far from the D.C. bubble I live in Los Angeles. Number three, Hillary is ahead in all the polls, so I'm not sure why you are criticizing Hillary.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>To say also that it's bad that she had a bathroom break. I mean are you kidding me? Is that what we are doing?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOLLING:</b> No, no, not that. But she came back late to a debate being televised live on ABC.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>LITTMAN:</b> So what. I don't think -- I truly seriously I don't think any voter is going to care.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOLLING:</b> By the way, Dan, I think she occupied that restroom other, I guess Bernie Sanders was trying to get in there.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BONGINO:</b> Eric, listen I don't know if the L.A. bubble is much better, by the way. But the narrative about Mrs. Clinton is she is an elitist insider that's leveraging her connections because she craves power more than anything that she has no principles.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Listen do they care that she went to the bathroom. That's not the point. That's not what I said. You skewed my words. What I said was the fact that she came back late gave the appearance, at least on TV, she doesn't seem to care about anyone else. And biting narratives in politics, as you know, are the ones that fit the preexisting narrative.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>LITTMAN</b>: Wrong.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BONGINO</b>: What's that?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>LITTMAN</b>: All right, Dan, to who did it give that impression number one?

You have two frontrunners. You have Donald Trump on one side. You have Hillary Clinton on the other side. Is this good politics, good strategy -- start with you Littman -- for either one of them to be taking shots at the other one who is leading their side?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>LITTMAN:</b> Generally, I think it's good for both of them. So I think on the Republican side for Trump to go after Hillary is a winner for Trump. On the Democratic side, and probably for most Independents, for Hillary to go after Trump, just increases her support also. So I think actually for both of them it's a win.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOLLING:</b> Ok. So, Dan, on Hillary's side she has got a clear lead.

Matt is desperate right here to pull out some benefit for Hillary. Hillary is getting smoked on this. And Matt, to answer your prior question, she was up in the polls against just about every Republican candidate a year ago. She is now getting shellacked by just about every one of them. So what do you mean to who? To just about everybody they are polling.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>LITTMAN</b>: What's the polling?

His big problem right now is that Ted Cruz is catching him, right? But for Donald Trump to be perceived as the frontrunner, which he still is, and have Hillary go after him is absolutely a win for Trump. The question for Trump is, are there enough angry white men to really win an election?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BONGINO: </b>No.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOLLING:</b> I'm going to go to Dan very quickly.
