As you most likely know by now, Hillary Clinton faltered at a 9/11 memorial on Sunday here in New York City.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>The campaign announcing afterwards she has pneumonia, something that they knew last Friday. Now, the stamina of both Mrs. Clinton and Donald Trump is amazing. These people are under constant pressure in motion all the time. And the fact that they can pull that off is astounding. Going forward both candidates should be candid about their health because it is a major factor in leadership. But that situation is far overshadowed by the basket of deplorables comment.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE</b>: You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(LAUGHTER)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Right?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>The racists, sexists, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.

She spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes, and scratch out a living for their family. Our support comes from every part of America and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions of working class families who just want a better future.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Talking Points believes that Secretary Clinton made a big mistake here.

That opinion echoed on the op- ed page of the \"New York Times\" today by another far left loon. What Mrs. Clinton's comments really do what they really do is mobilize those who were thinking about voting for Donald Trump. Not his hard core supporters. Those who are not quite sure.
