That put a tremendous strain on the U.S. military and the treasury. While both campaign accomplished some short-term goals like removing the tyrant Hussein and a vicious Taliban long-term the campaigns did not diminish the jihad.

But it's not the only kinds of extremism we face. So we're going to focus on all the different kinds of extremism with a heavy focus on people who do this in the name of Islam.

Marie Harf could not answer it -- the usual. It is clear to any fair-minded that there's something amiss with the President's view of the radical Muslim threat. \"Talking Points\" does not believe Mr. Obama should have necessarily attended the anti-terror rally in Paris over the weekend, but surely, surely, he should have sent someone in his stead.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>STEWART:</b> How could Obama not be there?

It's probably not true but certainly he is not a terror warrior. In fact, Secretary of State John Kerry just announced the administration will redirect $250 million to Pakistan, which has actively helped the jihad by providing terrorists sanctuary and still keeps the man who helped the U.S.A. get bin laden in prison.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So Pakistan will continue to receive almost a billion dollars from the U.S.A. this year alone.
