Univision anchorman Jorge Ramos confronted Donald Trump on immigration. We don't have to play the clips. Suffice it to say, there was a little tension. Everybody saw it. It's all over the place.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Joining us now from Miami is Jorge Ramos.

Now, in Israel, they put up a wall to separate themselves from terrorists. Hamas, infiltrators. This and that. It worked. Millions of people have come across that border. Most notably recently the man who killed Kate Steinle who came across that border, Jorge six times. Sanchez, so, for the benefit of all the people who would like to be safe for Kate Steinle's family, I think we need to put up the wall.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>RAMOS</b>: Well, first of all, the problem with on undocumented immigrants has been civilized. In other words, it's been about 11 million people for the last six years. Now, you are talking about Kate and let me say something first of all. I think my condolences to Kate's family. As a father, I cannot even imagine what they are going through. And as Kate's brother said yesterday on this show, the system failed.

Now, we want Kate's law which would say if an aggravated felon, someone convicted of an aggravated felony in the United States who is deported and comes back, mandatory five year prison, can get more, all right, in a federal penitentiary.
