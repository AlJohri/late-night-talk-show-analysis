Surely, that NCIS report was known by President Obama before he approved the release of five top Taliban terrorists from Guantanamo Bay. But even worse, were the public statements made as the time of Bergdahl's release.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: </b>Sergeant Bergdahl has missed birthdays and holidays, and the simple moments with family and friends which all of us take for granted.

What about the war on terror? What about the economy? Benghazi was bad enough. The White House describing the attack as inspired by an anti- Muslim video, but at least that was issued shortly after the fog of the battle. Bergdahl's situation was known for years.
