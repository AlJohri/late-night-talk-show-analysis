They get an allotment of money through the budget that's passed every year. This year this legislative operations branch got $3.3 billion and essentially it's divvied up among the different members. They get different amounts based on how far away they live from Washington. They have got to travel, they have got to have a staff. And they can use that money however they want. A number of members said listen, don't use your allotment for first class. We don't think it's appropriate. We have an $18 trillion deficit. We have got a ban on military members flying first class, why not for members of Congress but they couldn't even get it to a vote, Bill.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Okay. So each senator and each Congress person every year gets money from the taxpayer to run their operation, correct?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BREAM: </b>That is correct.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>And I was looking at the stats. It's in the millions. It's in the millions of dollars. So, if you live in California, you get more money because it costs more to fly to California than if you live in Maryland, because you can just drive home.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BREAM:</b> Um-huh.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> But it's a lot of money. And then, therefore, the senators and Congress people, they lay out and usually through their chief of staff, who they have to pay, you know, 200,000 a year or whatever. These people don't come cheap, all right, how the money is being allocated. But we don't know how many of them fly first class, do we?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BREAM: </b>Yes. And there is no ban on it at all.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Right. So, they can fly first class. They can hire a charter jet if they want.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BREAM:</b> That's how they want to use their money.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> But they don't get any more money than what they're allotted each year.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BREAM:</b> Their allotment.

But wouldn't it be interesting to see how many of them are living large because that's always the accusation, that not only they make a decent salary and we don't begrudge them that but they have perks, they have parking, free gym membership. Cafeteria perks. Chief food, whatever it may be. And how many of them fly first class? I bet you most of them do.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BREAM:</b> I have seen it many times myself. I fly in and out of DC all the times.

Now, here is Shawn. So, you know this Clinton Foundation story. People are getting numb to it. Right? It's like every day here is another Clinton Foundation story and then they head for the exits. But this one is pretty interesting. Twenty nations and correct me if I am wrong, gave money to the Clinton Foundation and 20 nations received arms contracts or arms shipments from the U.S.A., is that correct?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:</b> Yes. That's correct. The International Business Times advocated an investigation. But Bill, the question is there a connection? Is there any wrongdoing with this? They looked at the 2011 Saudi Arabian arms deal. They say Saudi Arabia had given $10 million to the Clinton Foundation. But that was before Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Um-huh.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>SHAWN:</b> They say Boeing, a few months before this deal, gave $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
