We don't know if Mrs. Clinton herself will be called.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>What we do know is that some employees at the Justice Department, which runs the FBI, have helped Hillary Clinton out at least in campaign donations. Data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics says $75,000 donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>With us now David Bossie, chairman of the board of Citizens United, a watchdog group. Is this a big deal?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>DAVID BOSSIE, CITIZENS UNITED:</b> It is a big deal. I mean look, this just another piece of evidence. Look, Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General herself is a Clinton appointee by Bill Clinton. She owes her career to Bill Clinton.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>$75,000 doesn't sound like a lot of money but it's by key people in decision-making --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Miriam Vogel, associate deputy attorney general; Renata Hesse, principal deputy assistant general for criminal and civil operations; Brian Boynton -- these are big names, these are big guys and gals and they're giving thousands of dollars. But --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOSSIE: </b>They're decision-makers. That's the most important thing. How can the American people have confidence in an impartial investigation?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Let me challenge that. It's the FBI that has to make the recommendation whether to prosecute or not. Ok?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOSSIE: </b>Yes, sir.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: It's the FBI.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOSSIE:</b> Ok.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOSSIE</b>: And they are not tainted any way that we know of. And Comey, the director came out today and said he feels pressured to wrap up the investigation. Good. Good.

They have a right to donate to anybody they want. In fact a couple voted -- I mean a couple -- donated to Donald Trump like $500.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOSSIE</b>: Sure.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> So you are saying they shouldn't have anybody, any political donations?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOSSIE</b>: Look, I think that it tinges the investigation. The American people are going to look at this and say was this an impartial investigation? Was it a thorough investigation? Was it fair?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Hillary Clinton has to be called for by FBI for an investigation. If she is not, there is a problem with that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: That would be strange. But the American people are going to decide based upon what the outcome is. So she is not indicted and conservatives who don't like her are going to say it's tainted. You know that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BOSSIE</b>: Look, what we want -- what conservatives want is impartial investigation. That's why Congress, which should be doing something and is not, we have been calling for them to do something.
