It all goes back to what we've discussed in the past. There is a lack of leadership.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>There is not anyone in charge.

Look what we've got. Look what happened today. We blew up a truck,\" tut tut tut -- you know, there's no central force.

The most crucial decision Obama made on Iraq, the full withdrawal at the end of 2011 on the eve of his reelection. That, he was relatively uninvolved.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Bush, for all of his faults, was very deeply involved, particularly at the time of the surge, in making the decision, in going ahead with it. When it came to withdraw from Iraq, Obama, as you said, he farmed it out.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER: </b>This was a decision that had to be done at a presidential level. It had to have been a head of state in Iraq or negotiating with a head of state here. That's not how it was done. And, in the end, it fell apart.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Right.

We're keeping 10,000 there and you don't touch them.\" That's it. That's how you lead.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER:</b> Bill, that's OK but it was unnecessary. Every major faction in Iraq wanted the U.S. to stay.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Except Maliki.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER: </b>No. Maliki did. He absolutely did. We insisted that he had to go to parliament. And he said, \"Leave the procedures to us. I'm not going to go to parliament.\"</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>The Iranians didn't want us there and Maliki was listening to them.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER:</b> No, that's not -- Maliki knew that, in the end, he would depend on the U.S. He knew what was coming. When Obama came back, the number that the military had advised 10,000.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Obama proposed 3,000. That was a joke. That is less than anything required even to protect themselves.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> That's right. And put them in harm's way.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER: </b>If the Americans were not going to be serious, he was not going to risk their --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> There's no doubt that the President could have gotten it done if he wanted to. Now, all Americans, I think, understand the lack of leadership coming out of the White House.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And that's why the President's poll numbers are below 40 percent in job approval. However, in the African-American community, according to Gallup, they are 81 percent.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Eighty-one percent of American blacks support and approve the president's job performance. My question is a simple one because, as you know, I'm a simple man -- Is that totally based on race.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER:</b> It's probably a couple of things. One is, obviously, they perceive the President -- they perceive the presidency differently from the way you do.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But, second, I know you know it sounds pejorative to say only race. It is ethnic solidarity. Roman Catholics supported John Kennedy. Mormons were heavily supporting Mitt Romney.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>If we had a gay president, if we had a Jewish president, if we had a Hispanic candidate running for office, you would find a high level of association. And among African-Americans, it's all the more understandable.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Here's a community who, for hundreds of years, were oppressed. In your lifetime and mine, they were legally discriminated against by the state. And then they were essentially emancipated a second time in the '60s.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But in our lifetime, we have African-Americans whose parents were segregated and really treated badly. They now point to their children and say, \"Look at what we have achieved. Look at the man at the White House,\" as a form of aspiration and a form of pride.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>That is what any minority would do.
