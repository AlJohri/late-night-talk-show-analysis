As you may know some Americans believe the Pope is too liberal in his world view. Last night \"Talking Points\" addressed that. The memo is posted on Bill O'Reilly.com.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Tonight let's address what the Pope and the President said. Because the Pope speaks in heavily-accented English I will quote him. \"Mr. President, together with their fellow citizens, American Catholics are committed to building a society which is truly tolerant and inclusive to safeguarding the rights of individuals and communities, to rejecting every form of unjust discrimination with countless other people of goodwill. They are likewise concerned that efforts to build a just and wisely ordered society respect their deepest concerns and their right to religious liberty.\"</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now, that's a shot at President Obama and his belief that Americans should be forced to fund abortions and to perform services against their religious beliefs. The gay marriage controversy comes to mind. The Pope did this very gently, but that point was directed at Mr. Obama himself.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Pope Francis continued. \"I would like all men and women of goodwill in this country to support the efforts of the international community to protect the vulnerable in our world and to stimulate integral and inclusive models of development so that our brothers and sisters everywhere may know the blessings of and prosperity which God wills for all his children.\"</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now that's a challenge to all Americans to help the downtrodden. But how to help them is the issue. Most Americans are very generous folks. But we must all be careful not to make problems worse in the name of compassion.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Let's take Obamacare for example. It certainly helps poor people who cannot afford health insurance. There's no doubt the intention of that entitlement program is noble. But, by forcing subsidized health insurance payments on businesses, President Obama has made it more difficult to create full-time jobs in America. Thus, while some of the poor benefit, other Americans are punished because the job market is smaller and salaries are lower.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>It's well documented that many American businesses have cut back the hours of their employees citing the cost of Obamacare. So the truth is there is a better way to deliver health services to the poor than a massive government intrusive program. Insurance competition and direct subsidies to the destitute on a case by case basis is the answer.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now, on to President Obama's remarks today. First, he addressed the Pope directly.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>OBAMA: </b>You remind us that in the eyes of God, our measure as individuals and our measure as a society is not determined by wealth or power or station or celebrity but by how well we heed the scriptures call to lift up the poor and the marginalized.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>To stand up for justice and against inequality and to ensure that every human being is able to live in dignity because we are all made in the image of God.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> The key words there are \"every human being is able to live in dignity because we are all made in the image of God\". So, Mr. President, are aborted fetuses able to live in dignity? They are not able to live at all, are they?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>The Pope may not know this, but last Friday 177 Democrats voted against a house bill that would require American doctors to keep babies born alive during an abortion process from dying. 177 American elected officials, all Democrats, voted for infanticide. We have posted their names on Bill O'Reilly.com. That is barbaric. And President Obama said nothing about it. Nothing.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But Vice President Biden did make an interesting comment about life.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:</b> I'm prepared to accept that the moment of conception is human life.
