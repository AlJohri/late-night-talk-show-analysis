It asked registered voters to choose a candidate in a hypothetical race. And here they are: Ben Carson 50 percent, Hillary Clinton 39 percent. Wow. Donald Trump 45 percent, Mrs. Clinton 40 percent. Jeb Bush 44 percent, Hillary 40 percent. Carly Fiorina 42 percent, Mrs. Clinton 39 percent.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>By the way, the Fox poll asked the same question about Vice President Biden and he defeated every single Republican candidate.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Joining us now from Washington Kirsten Powers. First of all, before we get to that do you expect CNN to be tough on the Democrats tonight?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KIRSTEN POWERS, FOX NEWS ANALYST:</b> I hope so. I mean I think that they were -- it's different moderators Jake Tapper was the moderator last time. He's not going to be moderating this time. So we can't say it will be exactly like the Republican debate. But I think Republican debate was tough and I hope they will be tough on the Democratic debate as well.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>You hope but there's a difference between hoping and thinking. And there's so many things you can say. So many areas you can go in and then people going oh it should be boring. Believe I'm monitoring that debate, you would have to have the police in there because I have got so much.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So if you were the moderator what would your first question to Hillary be?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>I would ask her -- I would say a lot of people have said that you seem to be moving to the left because Bernie Sanders is in the race do you consider yourself a liberal?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Ok. I would ask her, Mrs. Clinton, the American ambassador to Libya was assassinated, cables show that you knew that was danger there. A cable from he himself stated that why didn't you upgrade security?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS: </b>She is so ready for that question -- Bill.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Think so?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS: </b>Yes. I do.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Ok. But by answering that question she goes on the record. The people who were there go yes or no. So you have got to get them there on the record with declarative sentences not wandering.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Ok now, Hillary Clinton loses to all of the Republican candidates. Does that surprise you?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS: </b>At this point it doesn't surprise me because I think the trajectory for her has been pretty bad. If you were to ask me six months ago, yes, this would be surprising to me. Not because I thought she was inevitable or anything like that but that she was a pretty strong candidate and look, she is getting beaten by people who have never even held office before.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Yes. And beaten pretty badly in Ben Carson's case. Trump who will be on this program tomorrow, Powers -- Trump is going to analyze the Democratic debate tonight. I mean come on -- I should charge admission to this. So he will be here tomorrow to do that. All right, now, you probably heard that Planned Parenthood has now said.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS: </b>Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> That none of their operations are going to accept money for fetal tissue any longer. Ok. Now, they can couch it any way they want to couch it. But this is an admission that their practices and their attitude toward those practices have been wrong. Is it not?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> I think it is. I mean it certainly can be interpreted as an admission of wrongdoing. It also raises questions as usual. And one of the big questions is, are they going to stop harvesting the fetal tissue.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(CROSSTALK)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> No, they are not. That question has been answered because they say the woman going into the abortion will still have the option of donating the tissue.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS: </b>Ok. So who is paying for it, right? Because they were saying that they needed to have these reimbursements to cover.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Well, they'll, farm it out like they always do. They farm out the abortions but they take a cut. They will farm this out and they say they won't take a cut of this.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But the whole thing is grisly. It has put Planned Parenthood into an interesting position because they can't defend what they do. But then you go back to the debate. You circle back to the debate.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>How about old Bernie Sanders? Don't you love to get Bernie? I'd love to get Bernie. Hey Bernie, you know, this Planned Parenthood thing is selling the baby tissues, what do you think about that? Do you like that? Is that a good deal? The way they were so cavalier about it and little cocktails and mentioning luxury cars and all that. What do you think, Bernie? You know, you could really go to town, could you not?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS: </b>Well, I mean he was asked about it when the video first came out and I think you know in the beginning the Democratic candidates were saying, of course, this was sort of unsettling, the tone that was being used.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Then they changed fast though after that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> Right. Taking a line of Planned Parenthood.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> War on women.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> But they don't -- they will just say that this isn't true that this is this right wing smear job.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Oh they still say that even though Planned Parenthood says they're going to stop doing it?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> I think they will.
