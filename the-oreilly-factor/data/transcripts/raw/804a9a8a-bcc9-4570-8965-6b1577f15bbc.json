His opinion that Muslims overseas should be temporarily suspended from coming to the U.S.A. has ignited, perhaps, the most intense political firestorm we have ever seen.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Overnight, Bloomberg conducted an Internet poll of about 600 folks -- 37 percent agree with Trump overall; 50 percent oppose.
