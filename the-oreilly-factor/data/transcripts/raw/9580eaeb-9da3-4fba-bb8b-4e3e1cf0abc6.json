Last night, he got a little testy with CNN.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP: </b>I think it's very sad that CNN leads Jeb Bush, Governor Bush down a road by starting off with virtually all of the questions, Mr. Trump this -- I think it's very sad.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But I thought it was very unfair that virtually the entire early portion of the debate was Trump this, Trump that in order to get ratings.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>OK, so were you mad at them?

I had a lot of fun doing it. I came in number one by almost everybody even your friend Krauthammer, who is totally biased. But even him I think he thought I did well.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But -- but I will tell you this, I thought it was really unfair what CNN was doing. Every question is like, well, Donald Trump said this, how do you respond to it. And if you look at that first debate, this poor Lindsey Graham, he's got zero in the polls, zero.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But you look at the first debate and every question asked -- and I thought Senator Santorum did a really good job and I thought Governor Huckabee did a really good job. That's primarily because they like me. I mean that's one of those things. But they did. They did a good job, the two of them.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But it was very unfair, I thought, where so many questions were about Donald Trump and let's go after now Donald Trump.
