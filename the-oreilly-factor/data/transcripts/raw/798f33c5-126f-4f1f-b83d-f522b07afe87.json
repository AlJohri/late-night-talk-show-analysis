And it's on full display in the mainstream media's coverage of the Mike Flynn wiretap Russia Intel investigations. As for the latest on Flynn, the former National Security advisor is seeking an immunity deal in exchange for testimony to FBI and Congressional investigators. The deal is reportedly been rejected by the Senate Intel Committee. And Congressman Adam Schiff, the House Intel Committee's ranking member, says they will discuss the offer with Senate and Justice Department counterparts before making a decision.

NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:</b> I just wonder what the Russians have politically, personally, or financially on President Trump. Because this is about a National Security issue. Why would the President of the United States for just come in and start to flirt with the idea of lifting sanctions on Russia in terms of their behavior in Eastern Europe. Why would the President of the United States question the START Treaty? Why the President of the United States put Putin on a pedestal and diminishes the greatness of America in that? There is something wrong with this picture?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p> <b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b> WATTERS: </b>Joining us now with reaction from Washington, Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, along with former State Department official David Tafuri.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p> Matt, I will start with you. It seems like if the press had been as aggressive covering this IRS scandal, I mean, they didn't do anything about that. I mean, had you Lois Lerner taking the fifth. People taking plea deals. And they didn't really care at all, but all of a sudden, you know, Mike Flynn makes a phone call and, you know, all hell breaks loose. Why is all of a sudden everybody in Washington an investigative reporter?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p> <b>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION</b>: Yes. Well, this is something you are going to have to learn, Jesse, which is Republicans tend to be very careful and sheepish when it comes to going after Democrats for scandals and investigations. Whereas Democrats, you know, I got to take my hat off to them. Every moment of every day they try to make every Republican feel like they are a criminal. Think about this case. Mike Flynn is the victim. He was unmasked. And he was -- and his identity was leaked to major news publications.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p> And now it's the Democrats saying somehow that Mike Flynn is the one who is the person who has committed, you know, has broken the law. It's ironic how they turn everything on its head.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p> <b>WATTERS</b>: Well, there is no evidence so far that has come out that he has broken any law. David, it seems to be funny that when Hillary's associates all got immunity deals, and that was fine. But Mike Flynn casually asks for an immunity deal and all of the sudden a press brands him some criminal? Don't you see a little bit of a double standard there?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p> <b>DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL</b>: Yes. You know, this should not be a Democrat or Republican thing. This should be something that all Americans care about. You know, the framers of our constitution were really worried about interference by foreign governments. That's why they put in the constitution protection so that foreign governments couldn't interfere in our democracy. That's at base what happened here. Russia interfered in our election. Now, for Matt to say that Flynn is a victim is unbelievable. Flynn has said he wants immunity from prosecution. I mean, he is suggesting that he has committed crime and he wants immunity to do --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p> <b>SCHLAPP:</b> No. Wait a second --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p> <b>TAFURI:</b> That's not other people who have engaged in crime.

If you are unmasked because you were in conversations with someone who was properly surveilled, like an agent of the Russian government, which is what happened here, that is not improper.
