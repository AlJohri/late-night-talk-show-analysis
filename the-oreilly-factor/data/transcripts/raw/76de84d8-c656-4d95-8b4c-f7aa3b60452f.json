By the way, Lester Holt from NBC set to moderate the first debate. Two weeks from tonight September 26th. I have known Holt for years. Worked with him at channel 2 here in New York City. He is a fair guy.

He says he will take a look at it, but he is not taking any firm position.

In March of 2003, he told Cavuto the conflict looked like a military success. He did not openly begin criticizing the war until September 2003. From then on, he wasn't supportive of the effort at all. So looking at all the data, all the data, Trump was never a big fan of the Iraq war. Even before it started he talked to Howard Stern on the radio about a potential war in Iraq and it was kind of well, you know, that kind of thing. But never a big fan of it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Tom Herrington, Jenison, Michigan. \"Is Trump using money from the RNC?
