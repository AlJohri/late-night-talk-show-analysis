First of all, I need some clarity on a few issues. Let us start with the Muslim registry controversy. What do you want there? What is your vision?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:</b> Well, it is very simple. When they come in from Syria, guest of President Obama, we should not be taking any because we have no idea where they come from, who they are. They have no paperwork. There is no way of proving that their paperwork is correct. When they come in from Syria. I want them to be registered. They have to be registered.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>We have to watch them, because we just do not know who they are. We do not know where they come from. We do not know if they are ISIS, and we do not know if they have evil intentions. So, I want them registered.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>All right. But they will be if they get papers to come here. ICE Home Security will know who they are, will know where they go. So, what you want is a reality already, is it not?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> No. What I want is I do not want them to come here --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> All right.

But I will take some women and children, who are languishing in these camps.\" That puts a humane face on it, and does not put us in danger, would not that be smartest strategy?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> Well, I will tell you.

They go from Syria to Minnesota. Not exactly so great. They probably want to be there. You do a safe zone --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Well, it does not matter what they want.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> You do a free zone.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> If you have a safe zone in your own country, they stay there.
