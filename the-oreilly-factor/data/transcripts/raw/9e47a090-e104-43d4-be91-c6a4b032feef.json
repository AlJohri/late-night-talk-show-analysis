And I know from my own experience, on a recent trip to the Middle East, spending several days talking with folks I've dealt with all the way back to Desert Storm. They all are absolutely convinced that the American capacity to lead and to influence events in that part of the world has been dramatically reduced by this president.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Joining us now from Tampa Democratic strategist Jessica Ehrlich; and here in New York, Andrea Tantaros, co-host of \"OUTNUMBERED\".</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So according to Mr. Cheney -- I know you don't read \"Playboy\" but I did read the interview today.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>ANDREA TANTAROS, FOX NEWS HOST: </b>Thank you, Bill, for reading \"Playboy\" for me.

I think it just might be a little bit of an overstatement based on ideology, am I wrong?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TANTAROS:</b> I don't think you're wrong. I do agree with Dick Cheney that he is one of the worst presidents -- no question. I think there are comparisons early on to Jimmy Carter but I think Cheney's right. And I think the point that he made in the article where he says that our friends no longer trust us and our adversaries no longer fear us is not hyperbole though. I think this is right on point.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And Cheney, I'm sure he goes on for hours. Because he sat with James Rosen for 10 hours on the story.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Yes. But it's interesting.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TANTAROS: </b>To list what he'd done and specifically, Bill, he points to the military and how he has (inaudible) --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Yes. He is mad about that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TANTAROS: </b>-- our military and how he has put us in a very precarious position. And I think that that, above other presidents, he has done the worst job.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> What Rosen did not do though was, Jessica, just for your side, he didn't challenge Cheney about the chain reaction of Iraq that has caused unintended consequences, even when Bush the younger and Cheney were in office. The unintended consequences of that invasion were staggering for America.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And then he didn't get into that -- you know. And that is not an excuse for President Obama's performance, which I believe has been very weak, particularly abroad. I mean I just think as I said to Barney Frank last night, there isn't anything you can -- not one accomplishment, not one Jessica -- and if you have one I want to hear it right now -- of President Obama's foreign policy, which includes Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. There is nothing to point to, is there?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>EHRLICH: </b>Well, I think actually he has accomplished the goals that he set out --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>What?

He said that he'll be going to --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Ok. That is not what the President is in office to do. The president is in office to do -- make the country stronger. And just by your presence because you are a smart woman -- Barney Frank couldn't give me one and you can't give me one either. Not one accomplishment in six years overseas --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>EHRLICH: </b>Let's say Osama bin Laden.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>He had nothing to do with that. That was U.S. Intel and the Navy SEALs taking them out. He just said do it. Come on.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>EHRLICH:</b> Well, it happened under his watch.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>So what.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>EHRLICH: </b>It happened under his watch.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>All right -- fine.

Now, Dick Cheney, he despises Barack Obama -- all right. I think it's personal.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TANTAROS:</b> I think the feeling is probably mutual.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> I would agree, all right, because they're so opposite in their view of the world. There's never going to be detente. Ever.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Cheney is a tough guy and he wants to wield U.S. power. Obama feels that U.S. power is part of the problem in the world. All right? So what is the point in -- I don't know what the point is. If I were Dick Cheney I would have just taken apart every single policy. I would have never talked about Barack Obama as being weak or this or that. I would have said here is the policy on Egypt. Here's the policy on Russia. That is what I did with frank last night -- bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. Isn't it much better than getting into personalities?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TANTAROS:</b> Look, I think that he had to weigh into his personality because that plays a huge role in why we're seeing such failure. I mean especially in the Arab Spring. When you mentioned the Arab Spring Bill, in Egypt -- I mean Jessica says he has been consistent. The only thing he has been consistent about is backing the wrong horse. He had Hosni Mubarak --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>No, you're wrong.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TANTAROS:</b> Well -- how?
