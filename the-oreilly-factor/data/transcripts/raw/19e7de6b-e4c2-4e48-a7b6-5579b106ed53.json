As we mentioned, the new Quinnipiac poll shows Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton in Ohio, virtually tied with her in Pennsylvania and Florida -- very good news for Mr. Trump, who joins us now from his headquarters in New York City.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>First of all let's all talk Speaker of the House Paul Ryan -- you're going to meet with him on Thursday. What's your opening statement going to be?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: Well, I think the opening statement is, number one, I have a lot of respect for Paul and I think we are going to have a very good meeting, I hope. And I think the big thing is in the history of the Republican Party, nobody has ever gotten more votes than I have gotten in the primaries. I mean, I'm millions and millions of votes additional and I guess by the time we finish, it's going to be many millions of votes ahead of anybody else, any other Republican in the primaries. That's a big thing.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Plus, a lot of people, a lot more people came out to vote this year in the primaries than they did four years ago or at any other time. So, I think that's a great sign. And, you know, we are doing very well in the polls.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Ok, but he knows all that.

I believe we'll have great unity in the party. Many people have come out and endorsed and been really strong. Rick Perry came out today and many others. And they really gave their support in a very strong fashion.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Ok. But not Ryan.

Frankly, as you know, the previous supporter of mine Scott Brown is somebody that gave me a lot of information about her and friends up there, she has had a big failed record as a senator. And all of a sudden about a week ago, she started tweeting violently about me. Just every tweet was like about Trump, Trump, Trump.

And she would like to make sure the Democrats win. But she sees polls that I'm going to beat Hillary, and a lot of, you know, there are a lot of polls taken by individual people that show me beating Hillary fairly easily, and she doesn't want that to happen. Now, she has -- I have never seen -- she went on a Twitter rant that was sort of amazing. So, I tweeted a few things and that was the end of that and I haven't heard from her since.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: I have a question from a viewer.

Can you?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> Well, I think that are what we're doing and I think it's a very important element in what I have done. I have become pro-life. I was in a meek fashion pro-choice, but I have become pro-life. But I become pro- life. And the reason is, I have seen, in my case one specific situation, but numerous situations that have made me to go that way. I will protect it and the biggest way you can protect it is through the Supreme Court and putting people in the court. And actually the biggest way you can protect it, I guess, is by electing me president.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: All right.

I think one of the biggest things happening in terms of this election are, you know, it could be as many as five judges will be appointed over the next four and a half years. So we're talking about five judges. And I think probably the most important thing that one of the most important thing, other than the security itself of the country is going to be the appointment of four to five Supreme Court justices and I will be doing that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> All right.
