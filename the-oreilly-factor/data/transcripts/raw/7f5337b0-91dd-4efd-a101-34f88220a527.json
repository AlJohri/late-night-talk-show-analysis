Here I am. Here is the strategy you should employ immediately. The President of France clearly stated the ISIS attack was an act of war. France is a member of the 28-nation NATO appliance. Article 5 of that alliance says that an attack on one country is an attack on all.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So all 28 nations should now begin to organize a campaign to crush the ISIS killers. That should include ground troops, bombings, no-fly zones, border security for Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and a central command and control center based in Europe.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Once NATO declares war on ISIS things will radically change. The anti-ISIS Arab nations will step up their participation and the jihadist group will begin to be isolated. No one is calling for an occupation of Syria and Iraq -- that would be foolish but surely, surely 28 nations can launch tactical strikes both on the ground and in the air that will crush these people.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>President Obama should take the lead along with France and Great Britain to make all that happen. The first step: a declaration of war on ISIS by NATO.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Finally, it was quite clear in the President's press conference today that he is very concerned about the refugees fleeing Syria and he should be concerned because it's his fault. When the Syrian dictator Assad used poison gas President Obama threatened the man. You may remember he did not carry out his threat which he could have easily done by destroying the Syrian air force on the ground which was delivering some of the gas.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>The President's retreat from Syria has caused the massive refugee problem. And remember one of the ISIS killers in Paris apparently posed as a refugee to enter France. Nonetheless, Mr. Obama is quite confident that no terrorists will be among the 10,000 refugees he wants to resettle in America.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>That of course, is another delusion. And at least 15 states right now have already said they will not accept any refugees at all. Expect that number to grow as more and more Americans finally realize, finally that the President of the United States has lost control of the war on terror.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And that's &#8220;The Memo&#8221;.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n\n            \n                \n                    <p><i></i></p>\n                \n                \n\n\n \n\n\t<i></i>\n\n            \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n                          \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t        \r\n\n\t\t\t\t    ", "title": "Bill O'Reilly: Is President Barack Obama delusional?", "description": "'The O'Reilly Factor': Bill O'Reilly's Talking Points 11/16", "date": "2015-11-17T13:23:11Z"}
