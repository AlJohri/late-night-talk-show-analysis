He was given a standing ovation by the GOP loyalists in the crowd. At first, the Senator's speech was standard issue that the country needs to be revitalized and Democratic Party is the devil. But by the end of the speech, the Republican faithful were wanting an endorsement but it didn't come.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS SENATOR: </b>If you love our country, and love your children as much as I know that you do, stand and speak and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(CROWD CHANTING \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"! \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"! \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"! \"WE VOTE TRUMP\"!)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>I appreciate the enthusiasm of the New York delegation.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> So the chant was endorse Trump.

Talking Points believes that Senator Cruz was wrong to deliver his speech if he was not going to outwardly support the nominee Donald Trump. In addition, Mr. Trump himself was magnanimous in allowing Cruz to have a featured spot. The Trump campaign says it knew Cruz was not going to endorse but allowed him to speak anyway. So it looks like Donald Trump's the good guy here. Remember, we did not have to give Ted Cruz 24 minutes of prime time exposure at this convention. The Trump people are in charge.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now, I understand the bad blood between Cruz and Trump. I understand that personal attacks. They are not easy to forget. But, you don't show up if you're not comfortable endorsing the candidate. Governor John Kasich has taken a lot of heat for not being here at the convention in Cleveland. But in his conscience, Kasich could not endorse Trump so he stayed away. Ted Cruz should have done the same thing. And that's &#8220;The Memo&#8221;.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n\n            \n                \n                    <p><i></i></p>\n                \n                \n\n\n \n\n\t<i></i>\n\n            \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n                          \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t        \r\n\n\t\t\t\t    ", "title": "Bill O'Reilly: Some Drama At This Convention And It Took Place Last Night", "description": "'The O'Reilly Factor': Bill O'Reilly's Talking Points 7/21", "date": "2016-07-22T12:13:37Z"}
