Let's bring in the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump who joins us now from Bangor, Maine. So, I'm looking for specifics tonight, Mr. Trump, do you have any for us?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP: </b>Well, I do have them and I hate to give them out because frankly if I win, it looks like I have a pretty good chance of winning, I don't like to be giving out all of this information. I'd like to just go and do the job. If you look at General Patton he wasn't one to give out information on television and then do whatever he has to do.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Yes.

Believe me. I was the one that said take the oil. And I hate it to tell everybody and we should have taken the oil when we left and we didn't do it. And who has the oil now? ISIS has the oil.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Yes. But then Iran is going to stop people from Iraq. Taking the oil is not going to stop people from blowing up airports and killing people in night clubs.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> No, it's not.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: And so, what I'm trying to get at here is look, I just laid out a very specific plan. All right? But it's a plan that doesn't have well we are going to invade here and we are going to have this many troops here. We're not that. But just a plan that you mobilize the most powerful alliance on the face of the earth. Okay? They commit, right, to killing savages. That's a plan.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: Hundred percent.

Would you go to Brussels and get NATO?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: I would certainly do it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Would you do it?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP: </b>So, Bill, if you remember, four months ago I said that NATO is obsolete because they don't cover terrorism and everybody smiled and they all had a good time and they were saying well, what does he know? What does he know? What does he know? But I said, NATO is obsolete. They also said the countries of NATO aren't paying us what they should be paying us. They are not even living up to the agreement.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Okay. So, about three or four days after I said it people that study NATO said, you know what? Trump is right. Then about two weeks ago on the front page of the \"Wall Street Journal\" I read where NATO is setting up a whole terrorist organization and I said it's obsolete because it doesn't cover terrorism properly. And they all said I was right. Now they're setting up an organization headed by one of the top people and they have a terrorism organization. Okay.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Does anybody say that was a good move or a good thought? No. But that's okay. NATO ought to go in there and wipe them out. And I think, also, Turkey, you know, Turkey has been deceived by ISIS. And assuming this was ISIS that did the attack, yesterday, Turkey has been totally deceived. Turkey has a very strong army. I have a feeling that Turkey will be unleashing a very strong force.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> They are 50 miles away.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: Because of what happened.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>They're 50 miles away.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> They're very close.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: They could get to Raqqa in two hours with a mechanized unity.

A lot of people don't understand, you know, I do have a pretty great understanding and a commonsense of what's going on. I was not one that wanted to go into Iraq. It was a huge negative. It was a huge mistake to go into Iraq.
