As we've been reporting, Hillary Clinton believes that Donald Trump is a sexist. Mr. Trump believes Mrs. Clinton is incompetent, corrupt, and would not even be in the presidential arena if she weren't a woman. That sets up a big gender politics situation.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Joining us now from Washington to discuss it Kirsten Powers. So, how do you see this?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KIRSTEN POWERS, FOX NEWS ANALYST: </b>Okay. So, I think that in terms of saying that Hillary Clinton has played the woman card, I think that's a true statement in the sense that she has made an overt, you know, plea to people saying, we need to have a woman in the White House. She says this distinguishes her.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But I don't think it's something Trump should be saying, and I also don't think he is right that she would not be successful candidate if she -- if she weren't a woman. If she was a man. And so I don't even know why he said that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Hillary Clinton, were just like Madeleine Albright, for example, or a Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state without a husband who was a former president, do you really believe with all of the stuff on Hillary Clinton's resume that she would be a presidential contender?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS</b>: Yes, why not? I mean, how is she any less impressive than Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Not talking about her being impressed. I mean, you can, it's basically she has been under fire for 30 years.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> Well --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> You know, and maybe some of it is unfair. Possibly it is.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS</b>: Yes.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: But, if she didn't have the Clinton name, I'm not sure --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> But she wouldn't be under fire if she didn't have the Clinton name.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> But she's done some of the things that have brought the fire on her.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> But a lot of it is stuff that happened because she was Bill Clinton's wife. And so, I mean, there's two different ways to look at it as a thought experiments. I mean, there is one if she had never married Bill Clinton and I would say that we could ask would Bill Clinton had been president if he hadn't married her. And I think that she would have done very well. She was very, you know --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Very smart woman. There is no doubt she is a smart woman and then she wants to serve her country.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS</b>: Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Okay. I mean, that's for the audience to decide. Now, you made an interesting statement, you don't think Trump should say that she wouldn't be considered. That's his opinion. Why --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS</b>: I mean, he can say it if he wants. I don't agree with it. And I don't think it helps him.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Yes. Okay. But he has the right to state that without being labeled a sexist, doesn't he?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> Well, I mean, I think that he shouldn't be surprised when he is labeled a sexist.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Why? I don't understand what this whole labeling business is about.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS</b>: Because I think women are tired of hearing from people about how, you know, they are somehow advantaged by being a woman. And most women did not feel that they have been advantaged in the work place by being a woman. And so, I think that is something that will rub a lot of women the wrong way.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: All right. So, let me understand. So, the message to women is, because there is a history of women having a harder time in the marketplace than men, if you reference anything about a woman's abilities you are a sexist?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> No, it's not about her abilities. It's saying basically you are getting an advantage because you are a woman.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Yes. Because he ran her abilities down and he says she is not qualified.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> And I think that, look, I'm not saying that she is using it and she is using it to her advantage. I'm just trying to explain the psychology behind it. I mean, I wrote a column today.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> You sounded like you were personally offended when Trump said that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS</b>: I disagree with him. I wasn't offended because if disagree with him.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Well, because you are a Democrat and you feel that Hillary Clinton is qualified, right?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS</b>: I don't think being a Democrat has anything to do with it. I think there are plenty of people who think she is qualified but she may not be the person for them but, you know, I think most will recognize that she is an accomplished woman.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: All right. Look, I got to get this on the record. So you are offended by Trump's description of Mrs. Clinton not being job ready? Not because he said anything about her being a female.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS</b>: Yes. First of all, I'm not offended. I don't agree with it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> All right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS:</b> And I think that -- I just don't agree with the statement that Hillary -- I think Hillary Clinton on her own, without Bill Clinton is extremely impressive person and could easily have risen to the place that she is today on her own, not.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Do you understand now?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>POWERS</b>: Not as a woman.
