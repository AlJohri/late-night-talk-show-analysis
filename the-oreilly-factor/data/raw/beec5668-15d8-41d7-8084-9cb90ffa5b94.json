And can I say that. I don't have to be politically correct. And if you look what's going on throughout the world, you look at Syria where if you're Christian, they are chopping off heads. You look at the different places, and Christianity, it's under siege.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Joining us now from Des Moines, Iowa is Mr. Trump. So, let's stay in the U.S.A. for this discussion. Do you believe Christianity here is under siege?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> Absolutely, you just take a look what's going on. Even from something that is less important but very important to a lot of people, including me, the words \"Merry Christmas\". You go to a department store today you don't see \"Merry Christmas\" anymore. We are under siege. We are losing ground. Christians are losing ground in this country.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now you get outside of the country and they want to come into this country as you know whether it's ISIS or anybody else and you have their heads being chopped off. We are definitely under siege.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>How does a president of the United States change the culture of secularism? Because that's what this is all about. It's about we don't want judgments and religion. It's not just Christianity. It's all religions. We don't want judgments. We want to be secular. And how does the President change that?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> Well, I think you have to change it almost with a different spirit than we have. We don't have that spirit anymore, you know. We have a president that is much more committed, in my opinion, to Iran than he is committed to Israel as an example. Much more committed to certain things that you or certainly me would not be committed to than what he would be, according to what we believe.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And you look at things that are happening within the country, outside of the country, but, little things like our friends that aren't Christian, that love Christmas. I mean, they say oh, Christmas is coming. And they are not Christians. And it's ok to say Merry Christmas and happy holiday, but now stores aren't even able to say Merry Christmas.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(CROSSTALK)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Yes. But we won that. You know, look, you know I have been in the forefront of that. I think we won that deal because we said to any major department store chain if you forbid your employees to say Merry Christmas we will tell everybody and they are not going to buy at your store.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP:</b> But they don't do it, Bill.

Maybe they are afraid legally. They are afraid they are going to be sued. They're afraid of retribution of some way. They're afraid a customer won't buy a bag of goods. They are not doing it and that's a small thing but it really is a telltale sign of what is going on.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>I mean we're just -- somehow, you know the power of Christianity is amazing in terms of the political power. I think it's because they are afraid they're going to lose their tax exempt status that they won't get together but the Christians have to get together. There is a problem.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(CROSSTALK)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>It's political correctness.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: Bill, there is a problem they have with that. But they do have a problem with tax exempt status. I mean they are afraid to get too political because if they get political, they're going to have to all of a sudden -- they will lose that status and they don't want to do that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: You are talking about the churches fighting back.

They just said in one of the articles, a world class businessman, which is what I was and what I'm not now. I'm a politician, if you can believe it. I hate the term politician but I guess that's what I am.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And I would take care of everybody. I give to everybody. I get along with Clinton. I get along with the Speaker of the House. I get along with everybody. That was my obligation.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>I got along with Democrats and liberals and Republicans and conservatives. And they called me and they loved me and if they wanted to have dinner they would call me and whatever I wanted I got. That's part of being a successful businessman.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>So you bribed them.

And I have to tell you this in all fairness. I thought that money was being put to very good use. I assumed it was being put to whether it's Haiti or all of the different things that I heard about. I didn't know about the private airplane rides all over the place. And if you look at the kind of expenses that they charge and the way they lived, I had no idea of that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But I will say that as far as the foundation is concerned, I assumed it was being put to good use and so did everybody else that gave and there were a lot of people that gave. They never really did anything for me, but I will say this, if I think they probably would have liked me and, you know, whether you give here or give there, I got along with everybody, Bill. I get along with everybody.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: All right.

I mean we're doing this interview I'm sitting in Iowa. And I have a lot of meetings today. Tomorrow I'm going to be here for a long time. And it matters to me because I have a great relationship with Iowa, the people of Iowa. I have a great relationship with evangelicals and the Tea Party.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>I think I'm going to do really well in Iowa.

I will not be mad but I would love to win Iowa. I mean I really have a great relationship with the people of Iowa. And I think we are going to do very well here but who knows?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Did you watch the Democratic debate on Sunday night?

I mean he was the mayor of Baltimore, he's a total loser. He's got like one percent and he's a disaster. He shouldn't be up there.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Sanders -- if you had to vote for one.
