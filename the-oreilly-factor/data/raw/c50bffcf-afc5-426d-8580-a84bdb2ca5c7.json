We saw that yesterday in the senate as 44 Democrats and one Republican Kirk of Illinois voted against defunding sanctuary cities as well as punishing illegal alien felons who defy deportation. 45 senators failed to uphold federal law violating their oath of office.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Where is the outrage?

And they don't influence how I make my policy decisions here in San Francisco.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> So let me be very clear. That woman is a disgrace. And if I were the attorney general of the United States, I would immediately place her under arrest. I might not win the case, but I would send a message to all subversive office holders in this country that if you do not obey federal law, you yourself will be prosecuted.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And where is President Obama on upholding the law?

But don't defy it because then every single American can pick and choose what law to obey under equal justice for all -- right?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>There's no question that our elected officials in Washington and in places like San Francisco are actively undermining the rule of law in this country. What kind of message does it send when the Senate condones a city like San Francisco releasing a seven-time foreign felon who then kills an innocent woman?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>As for the city of San Francisco, it's hopeless -- a free fire zone of antiestablishment behavior. As Talking Points stated yesterday, there comes a point when the American people have to rise up and elect responsible people to run the country. Throw out the irresponsible people.
