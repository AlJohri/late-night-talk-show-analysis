President Obama saying yesterday he will use his executive power to reform immigration.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: </b>Before the end of the year, we're going to take whatever lawful actions that I can take that I believe will improve the functioning of our immigration system that will allow us to surge additional resources to the border where I think the vast majority of Americans have the deepest concern.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Well he's right about that. Joining us now from Washington, Ed Henry. Here's why I'm confused, Henry. And I know you're the man to straighten me out. He said before the end of the year he's going to take his pen and do whatever he's going to do. Nobody knows what that is yet.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>However in his press conference, the body of his press conference he says well, I'm anxious to hear what the Republican ideas are on immigration reform. I want to listen to the Republicans. How can he listen to them when they're not sworn in until January and he says I'm going to do this by the end of the year?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: </b>You're right not sworn in yet, number one. Number two he's also saying in one hand he wants to work with these Republicans. He sees the new balance of power and yet he's saying I'm still bullying ahead with an executive order that he's been talking about before the election and so that doesn't sound like cooperation when you want to go ahead unilaterally.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And I think the other thing is in that clip it was interesting that he was highlighting what the executive order he claims will do which is we're going to surge resources to border which deals with border security that Republicans say should come first but in fact while there might be some money for that what these one or more executive orders would do were told would provide more work permits to keep illegal immigrants inside the country.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So yes there may be an element of border security to it but he's emphasizing that at the news conference because it's more popular when in fact the less popular part is really going be the focus keeping illegal immigrants in the country.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>All right but he's got to know that if he does something that is controversial or that the GOP doesn't sign off on that the committees will deny him funding. That he won't get funding for any of it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY:</b> Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>And so he won't be able to do it. So then it becomes well I want to do this for political reasons to anger the Hispanic and liberal communities to go against the Republicans and further demonize the party setting up 2016. That's pretty cynical for a president of the United States. That's pretty cynical. Now I'm not saying he's doing it. I'm not going to sit here and say he's doing it. I have no evidence to point to that. But if he did do it, that would be horrible.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY:</b> If he did. But you know what the Republicans, regardless of the President's motives. Because as you say we don't know for sure what he will do and why he's doing it. But the Republicans can actually supersede any executive order the President wants on immigration by actually passing a bill.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Bill so it's interesting that the Republicans they talk about that balance of power it has changed for the President but it has changed for the Republicans, too. They've done pretty well opposing his agenda the last six years but the White House points out and I think it is true that over the next two years the Republicans will have the house and the senate. So if they want to scream and yell about the executive orders that are coming they can wipe them out and supersede them with a law that actually focuses on border security. I think it's also put up or shut up time for Republicans.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> He will veto the law.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY: </b>Well he could but then it forces him back to him and the Republicans take back the power and say we're actually securing the border the President vetoed it. But the problem is they haven't sent a bill like that to his desk. Now before it was Harry Reid but now it's Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Look I don't want to get too inside baseball here but they can't send anything until they are sworn in.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY: </b>Yes well I'm talking about Denver yes.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> He's saying -- he's saying before the end of the year.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY:</b> Right. It's going to happen on mid-December.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Yes, nobody can stop me.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY: </b>Right but if they pass a law on January or February even if he does something in December before it's even taking effect and they are trying to surge the resources and move forward that Congress can pass a law. And you're right it can be vetoed by the President but before the Republicans were saying well John Boehner had a border security Bill and that mean old Harry Reid blocked it that was their talking points. Well guess what Harry Reid is out of power come January.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> I know.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY: </b>So Mitch McConnell who is talking a good game he can actually do this bill so.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> You and your pinheaded friends in the Washington and Fox News bureau you're all caught up in this. They can do this and that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY:</b> No it's not like baseball.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Here is the effect on the country as the civil war breaks out. You've got two more war breaking out and that's where it will happen. All right so instead of concentrating on the economy and making things better and raising wages as I proposed.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY:</b> But an executive order is not going to cause a civil war.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Sure it is if the Republicans come in and the first thing they do is pass a law to negate this executive order and then the President vetoes that law, it's a civil war Ed. That's a civil war.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY: </b>If he vetoes it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>It will take up months and months and months.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY: </b>But if they pass a bill -- but Bill if they pass the bill that finally makes sense and actually secures the border that you've been calling for, for years.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>HENRY:</b> And the President vetoes it, don't you think the President is going to look silly? Don't you thing the onus will be on him finally.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> He's going to look silly. I'm holding it over for me but I got to go. But he's going to look silly if he makes an executive order that they negate and then he signs the negation. That's going to make silly. All right this is serious business. This could place this country in an untenable position, particularly with the economy being -- it has to be healed. All right Ed Henry everybody. He's watching it for us.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><i>Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
