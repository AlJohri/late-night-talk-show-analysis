TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:</b> Well, look, it's the nature of political season when everyone is attacking everyone, it drives everyone's negatives up. But I think we are going to see in November a clear contrast. I think Hillary Clinton is likely to be the Democratic nominee. Her agenda doesn't work.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Well, if you are the nominee there will be a clear contrast. But here it seems Americans are more negative than usual. We compared against Romney and McCain and Obama. It's more negative this year than it has been in the past.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CRUZ</b>: Well, this is been an unusual cycle. I think it's fair to say the candidates running the cycle are not typical. We have never had a full blown socialist, an admitted socialist at least in this --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>And he is popular.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CRUZ: </b>And he is popular.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: And there is not a lot of difference between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on policy.

All right. So, you think it's the rough and tumble that have gotten through to the folks and they are tired of it but, if you run against Hillary Clinton. It's going to be rough and tumble. Really that's going to be a tough --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CRUZ:</b> No doubt. But my response in the primary as insults and nasty personal attacks have flown. I haven't played that game. I haven't responded in kind.

So, if Hillary engages on nasty attacks. I intend to go to the economy, to jobs and the people hurting that the Obama-Clinton economy doesn't work.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: It won't be her but her surrogates that come after you.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CRUZ</b>: Oh, sure.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Now, the \"New York Times,\" front-page article on you today saying that you are the most conservative political candidate since Barry Goldwater.

What I will say that the \"Times\" says right is that I'm a consistent conservative. But I've been a conservative my whole life. Now, the values I'm fighting for are common sense values. I think this election comes down to three issues, jobs, freedom, and security. And not a one of those is the narrow 51 percent wedge issue.
