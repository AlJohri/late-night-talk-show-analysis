So, someone could get off a flight and seek treatment from a witch doctor who practices Santeria.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>This is a bigger fear.

And what Andrea was saying is based on reality or am I wrong.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>GOLDBERG: No, you're not wrong at all. They talked about ignorance. The ignorance is on the part of Brian Stelter and Miles O'Brien.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Here's what they left out on CNN -- a British Red Cross worker who was working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone said this -- \"Some Africans believe the disease is a punishment or a result of witchcraft. Some families believe that when their loved one goes into an ambulance, they will be given an injection to kill them.\"</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So, if some Africans believe Ebola is the result of witchcraft, why is it a stretch to believe that some Africans may go to a witch doctor to get straightened out.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Here's what you're not allowed to say out loud and what you'll never hear from a liberal journalist at CNN or any other news organization -- \"Many Africans,\" -- I have to whisper this, -- \"many Africans in Liberia and Sierra Leone and places like that,\" yes, here it comes, \"are backward people. They do believe in witch doctors.\"</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But it's a lot easier -- they won't talk about that, the liberals, that makes them very uncomfortable. It's a lot easier to go after someone on Fox for using the term \"witchcraft.\"</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>O'REILLY: Yes, we're all racists here. We know that.

Let me just say this very briefly -- shame on Brian Stelter and Miles O'Brien.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>They have no idea how their liberalism affects and infects their journalism.

Therefore, Andrea Tantaros is not to be permitted to say that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>GOLDBERG: That's a very liberal statement.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>O'REILLY: Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>GOLDBERG: Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>O'REILLY: Now, in Miami where you live right now, there is a neighborhood called Little Haiti.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>GOLDBERG: Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>O'REILLY: And there are thousands and thousands of Haitians who have come over to the United States to seek a better life. A very small number of those Haitians practice voodoo, all right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>GOLDBERG: Exactly.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>O'REILLY: They do. Bernie and I know it. I've done a story in Haiti on voodoo. It is there.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>There are hungans, which are witch doctors. They are there. They charge for their services.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And, in Africa, it's the same thing. It may not be called voodoo, it's called something else.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>GOLDBERG: Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>O'REILLY: So, what Andrea was saying is that it is certainly possible that some infected patient with Ebola can get on a plane and go to Miami, go to Dallas, Texas where there are other communities who have these people in the United States.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And go there instead of going into the hospital. It's absolutely possible and it's in context.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>GOLDBERG: Let me make something very clear. Andrea Tantaros said nothing, nothing wrong. This is how crazy liberal -- liberalism in general.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>If they want to be crazy, that's fine with me. But when liberalism infects journalism, that really bothers me. It's that she used the term, \"witch doctor.\"</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And these two people who didn't know -- how do I know what the Red Cross worker said about how they believe in witchcraft and you know it but these two geniuses at CNN didn't know it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>It's a liberal political correctness. You say \"witch doctor\" and they say, \"Ooh, you can't say that. You're a racist,\" or imply that you're a racist.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>I've done stories on Haiti also. If I came back and said, \"You know, there are a lot of people there who believe in voodoo and go to witch doctors.\" Does that make me a racist.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Liberalism is wrecking journalism. And you know what, we're holding them accountable but nobody else is.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>O'REILLY: It doesn't matter.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>GOLDBERG: The other media critics don't hold them accountable, newspapers don't hold -- television media critics don't hold them accountable.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>O'REILLY: But the fact that we do and the fact that this segment will be on every Web site, political Web site in the country in about 45 seconds is -- we do what we can do, Bernie.
