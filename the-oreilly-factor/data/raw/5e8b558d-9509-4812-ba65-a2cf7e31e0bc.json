Just a few hours ago I spoke with Mr. Trump who was in Florida.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So the Democratic convention so far has been to counter you and your themes. Number one is that President Obama saved the country from a depression, that he inherited such a bad economic condition in 2008 that the economy is not his fault and he actually saved us from Armageddon. You buying any of that?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: </b>No, because it was going to work out, Bill. It always works out. We always have bad periods. And that was a bad period. But we have had many of them. And frankly it works out. And they could have done things a lot differently. And, you know, our recovery has been a very weak recovery. You look at the recovery, it's the weakest recovery in history. It's the weakest recovery on record. And you look at joblessness, and I'm not talking about the phony five percent number.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>I'm talking about the 21 percent or 22 percent, that is the real number where people can't find jobs. They can't find work. We were losing our jobs in our factories and everything else to other countries, including Mexico. So, you know, you know the real numbers. You see the real numbers.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Yes. I mean, the numbers aren't good. But it's an interesting argument because it's speculative and you can't deny how bad it was with Lehman Brothers folding and all of that and a lot of panic. But on the other hand, you know, eight years is eight years. And I tend to agree that the economy should be better than it is now. What about the minimum wage? You got hammered on that by Bernie Sanders last night. What's your vision for federal minimum wage? How much?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: Well, he lied last night. I mean, it was a total lie, and everybody said it, in fact, some of the folks on your network said, wow, that was really a lie, he said that I want to do go less than minimum wage. This is the new one. Because I'm the Republican that said in some cases we have to go more than minimum wage.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: But give me a number.

Let the states make the determination. Because if you take New York, it's very expensive to live in New York. And they need more than, you know, even, eight, nine dollars, so you go with the states.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: But the states have the authority now to do that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: They do.

Well, I would leave it and raise it somewhat. You need to help people. And I know it's not very Republican to say.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Well, give me 10 bucks?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: I would say 10.

But, the thing is, Bill, let the states make the deal.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Yes. But they do have the right to do that now. Because you could have a state that raises it to 15 and I would also, and this is just an aside, teenagers could make a little bit less, you know, first job if you are 17, you know, to get them in the workforce. But anyway, let's go on to --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: Well, let me just finish because a friend of mine is a very tremendous employer. And what he did is he said by raising it and by doing certain things it took the incentive. He pays people incentive basis, if they are really good, he gives them incentive. Nobody has ever heard of this before but a lot of companies do it.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Yes.

No, I believe it should be raised but when Bernie Sanders said that I want to go less than what the minimum wage, I mean, honestly, Bill, these people are lying so much.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> All right.

So, yes, I probably did.

I just want you to clarify them because I hate taking it from the press, because I agree with you that you are not going to get a fair shot in the press ever.

They are not living up to the bargain. They are not living up to their agreement. We have an agreement. We're going to protect countries. And I like NATO. I like the concept of NATO. But it's obsolete because we don't cover terrorism.

And we are not -- this isn't 40 years ago or 50 years ago where we can, you know, do whatever we want to do. We owe $19 trillion. Going to be 21 trillion very soon because of the horrible budget that was just made. We owe $19 trillion. And we are paying for all of these countries.
