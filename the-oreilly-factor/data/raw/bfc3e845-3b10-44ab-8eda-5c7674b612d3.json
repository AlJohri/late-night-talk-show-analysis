The man, 45-year-old Juan Sanchez will stand trial for second degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>The case is outrageous because the alleged killer had seven previous felony convictions in America. The government couldn't keep him out of the country.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So, The Factor has proposed a brand new law that would stop the madness. We call it Kate's Law after Miss Steinle and has been endorsed by her parents and brother.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>There are three versions of the law currently being debated in Washington. But the only one that has a chance of passing is this. Any illegal alien convicted of an aggravated felony who is deported and then returns to the U.S.A. would face a mandatory five year prison sentence at the very least.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>If the words \"aggravated felony\" are not included in the law, Democrats en masse will vote against it. And even if it did pass the House and Senate, President Obama would veto it. But by narrowing the law down to the worst offenders, the most violent people and not house painters that sneak back across the border, it makes it very difficult for liberals who oppose the law even though some would. If the aggravated felony Kate's Law does not pass, this country is hopeless. It's as simple as that. It's hopeless.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now, most fair-minded Americans support Kate's Law because it not only punishes dangerous foreign criminals but it gives law enforcement the tools to break up foreign gangs. Many of their members have aggravated felony convictions and have been deported. So drug gangs from Mexico, El Salvador, on and on would be disseminated by federal authorities and quickly. They just snatch them out.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>If any politician votes against Kate's Law they could have major problems. I mean how crazy would you have to be to vote against a law that protects Americans from violent foreign criminals and allows authorities to break up violent gangs? Again, if this law doesn't pass, it's hopeless in D.C.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now I've talked with some congressmen and senators who are shaping the law. And no one disagrees with me on the telephone -- no one. I'm confident that the law with the help of Senator Grassley and a number of congressmen will get to the voting floors and soon. If that does not happen, I will tell you exactly why and who is screwing thing up.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>The bigger picture here is that Americans are furious that our elected officials can't do the right thing quickly. That's why Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina have all attracted so much attention. Americans are tired of zombie politicians like Nancy Pelosi, who I believe would vote against Kate's Law.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Recently you she made an outrageous statement about the video showing Planned Parenthood discussing the sale of baby body parts.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>REP.
