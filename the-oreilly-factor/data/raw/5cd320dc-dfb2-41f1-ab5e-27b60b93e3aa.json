Not bigotry so much. Almost all sane Americans, accept and understand bigotry is wrong. As the Declaration says, all men are created equal and should be treated equally by their fellow citizens in government. The problem with race is how it is used in policy. Racial politics has created the grievance industry where some minority people and their white enablers believe they should be compensated for historical abuses.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Some Americans also believe they should get money, direct payments for subsidies reparations it is called. There are others who say because of slavery and the forced removal of Native Americans from their land that they cannot compete in today's marketplace, therefore, they want stuff that is the white privilege movement. That's especially troubling because it is being pushed primarily by white liberals who feel guilty that some minorities are not succeeding in America.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Therefore they believe those minorities are victims who cannot compete and must be treated as children. And granted blanket dispensations for irresponsible behavior. All of the above is corrosive to minorities and to American society in general.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Enter the Ebola controversy. It's now been established that three black nations in Africa -- Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia -- are Ground Zero for the spread of the deadly disease. 14 other African nations have now banned West Africans in the Ebola zone from entering their countries and 14 other nations have other travel restrictions.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But when \"Talking Points\" and others suggest the U.S.A. do the same thing, we're attacked as racist by pathetic ideological loons who could not care less about protecting the folks. This is a public health issue, a safety issue. Not a racial issue. Ebola knows no color. But the fact is that a Liberian national Thomas Duncan started the Ebola mess in America by lying to immigration authorities. Mr. Duncan paid for that with his life and his case has embarrassed American health officials.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So today, President Obama appointed a political guy, Ron Klain, to be his quote Ebola czar.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>OBAMA:</b> It may make sense for us to have one person in part just so that after this initial surge of activity we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we are crossing all the t's and dotting all the i's going forward.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> The appointment of Mr. Klain a former chief of staff to Vice President Biden will take the pressure off the besieged Dr. Thomas Frieden head of the CDC who has mucked things up big time.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>But the question remains will President Obama protect the American people by stopping travelers from the epidemic Ebola area?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>OBAMA: </b>I don't have a philosophical objection necessarily to a travel ban if that is the thing that is going to keep the American people safe.
