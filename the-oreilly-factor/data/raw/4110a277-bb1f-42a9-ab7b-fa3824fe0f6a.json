Granite State voters sent a signal loud and clear - we don't want establishment politicians. Exit polling shows that a whopping 95% of Republican voters are dissatisfied or downright angry with the political environment.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Only 10% of Democrats say they are angry, but 40% say they are dissatisfied. Donald Trump obviously gets a huge bump on his way to South Carolina, while John Kasich emerges as the moderate candidate to beat.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio were not helped by the New Hampshire vote, but they are still viable candidates, as is Jeb Bush.

Hillary Clinton is likely to clock him in South Carolina and beyond. Summing up, New Hampshire was good news for Trump, Sanders, and Kasich. For everybody else, it's on to South Carolina.
