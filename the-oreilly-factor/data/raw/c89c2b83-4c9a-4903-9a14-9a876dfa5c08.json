Interview with Donald Trump. The candidate joins us now from his New York City headquarters. First of all, you still believe that Egyptian Airliner was blown out of the sky? There is a lot of different speculation now.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: </b>I do. In a certain way. I mean, I don't know what they used but something bad happened and we'll see. I guess they will eventually find out but I certainly do. I know that plane very well. I know that type of aircraft. And you have thousands and thousands flying millions of miles and never been anything like it. So I do and I think most people do.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Okay. Now, would you support asking Congress for a declaration of war? To fight terrorism and then under that declaration it would be the groups that would be -- that the United States would declare war on, ISIS, al Qaeda, Taliban. Would you favor that because if your president, a declaration of war gives you more power to defeat these people?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: It wouldn't bother me at all doing that. We probably should have done that in the first place. Look, we are at war with these people and they don't wear uniforms. It's not your traditional war where it's a war against Germany, Japan, or whoever. This is a war against people that are vicious, violent people, that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We are allowing tens of thousands of them into our country now. So on top of wars on foreign land, wait until you see what happens in the future. It's probably not going to be pretty. I hope I'm wrong about that but it's probably not going to be pretty.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: All right.

We are allowing people into our country we don't know who they are, where they come from. Some of them happen to have cellphones with the ISIS flag on them. So, I think it's something that we have to be very tough and very vigilant and very smart or we will be in big trouble.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Okay. You've done very well with your national security policy. But I want to get you \"ON THE RECORD.\" Would you ask Congress to pass a declaration of war if you are elected?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP: </b>I would have no problem with doing it, Bill.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Okay.

I say if you do that, it's going to be a blood bath. They are not going to get that oil up easy. So, you're going to have to have ground troops to do it. It's going to be a blood bath. How about this? Would you support declaring that anyone buying oil from ISIS is an enemy of the state? That means an enemy of the United States? That way anybody who buys it, we can drop a drone on.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TRUMP</b>: Well, you know, it depends who it is and everything else.

Right after you, we're going to have a talk with Kirsten Powers about transgendered orders from the White House, which would basically put people who are transitioning from one sex to another but haven't done it biologically yet, in a locker room so you would have little girls, you know, eight, you know, to 11 or 12 with a boy who wants to be a girl in the same shower conceivably. That could happen. And in Charlotte observer, editorialized recently that that's fine, we need to get over that. I was a little perturbed by that editorial.

And that amazing thing is so many people are talking about this now and we have to protect everybody, even if it's one personal. But this is such a tiny part of our population. Now, with that being said, protect everybody, but I would really leave it up to the states in this case.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Do you have -- in your facilities, your hotels, do you have separate facilities for transgendered?
