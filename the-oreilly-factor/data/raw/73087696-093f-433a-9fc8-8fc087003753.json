Thus, the risk/reward ratio of dealing hard drugs rises.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Again, most politicians will never tell you the truth about social problems, preferring to pander.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Trump and Sanders, the victors last night largely won because they are seen as mavericks, outsiders who will dismantle a corrupt and inept political system.
