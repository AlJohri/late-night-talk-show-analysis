BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES:</b> But the principles that we're fighting for, the things that motivate me every single day and motivate my staff every day, those things aren't going to change. There is going to be a consistent focus on how do we deliver more opportunity to more people in this country. How do we grow the economy faster? How do we put more people back to work?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(END VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Joining us now from Washington, Charles Krauthammer, author of the huge best-seller, \"Things That Matter.\" I don't think the President has learned anything or even cares to learn anything. I think he is saying I'm going to go out guns blazing. I'm going to redistributionist guy. That's my legacy and that's what I'm going to do. Am I wrong?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: </b>You are absolutely right. He is a strange combination of obliviousness and recklessness? You know, it's as if he doesn't know what happens. I think he probably does. But he spent an hour and 13 minutes pretending he didn't. That this was some kind of referendum on does Washington work. I mean, you know, you are going to pretend this is an anti-incumbency election. When all of the democratic incumbents are wiped out on the republican incumbents survive? So, he pretends it's not that. But he is going to be reckless. I think he also is so sort of self-involved and he hates being sidelined. He hates what the democrats did to him over the last year. Making him irrelevant.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And how he is going to sort of get his revenge on everybody. By doing a reckless thing, which is to legalize millions of illegal aliens. I would say unconstitutionally. In a way that he knows is going to create a crisis. But what will it do? It puts him back in the limelight. Puts him in the spotlight. It makes him the issue. What are we talking about tonight? We're not talking about one of the most important elections in 20 years. We're talking about him. That's what he wants.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> OK. But let me just point out what I pointed out earlier in the program that he did say in this press conference that he was going to listen to what the republicans had to say on immigration. Going to consider what they have to they have to say, and I agree with you. If he signs an executive order legalizing millions of illegals, I think he's going to be impeached. I think it's just going to come down -- because the republicans cannot sit for that. They can't.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER: </b>I wouldn't impeach him, but that's a political point. I think it will be exactly what he wants. It would set up a new dynamic. We talk about nothing else between now and then. This is a time for republicans to be very disciplined. They won the election last night because they were disciplined. They stayed on message. They made a referendum on Obama. And they won. What they have to do now is to go from being the party of no to being a party with an agenda. Now, the only other time that's happened in a midterm was in the contract with America which was written in advance of the election. That's very rare. But now they have an opportunity to go from the party of no to a party that tells the country in advance of the 2016 elections this is what we want to do. And they should have a program ready to go like in '94. You pass a bill every week for ten weeks.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Absolutely.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER:</b> And you make the country see that you are ready. And you are radically different from this president.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> And tomorrow on my talking points, I'm going to lay out, you know, very specifically what some of those things should be. However, I have to get back to this. If President Obama signs an executive order to legalize undocumented people in this country, the republicans have to do something. They have to respond. The folks who elected them are going to expect a response. They can't just say we think it's bad. Something has to happen.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER:</b> All right. But here's what I think you should do. You should be very smart and disciplined. The prize here is not the impeachment of Obama and curtailing his term by three months. The prize is winning the White House in 2016 and changing the country. Now, the way to do it is you say this is unconstitutional, illegal. We are going to find every way we can to make sure that it is not funded, that this does not get a penny of the purse. It is illegal to enact anything by executive order unless you get some appropriation from the Congress. That's number one. Number two, you say on the day of the swearing in in 2017, if we win the White House this is an executive order and it lives only as long as the next president does not cancel it. It will be canceled with the stroke of a pen. And then you say we're going to look and hope that we can encourage private legal challenges to this action because the Supreme Court, the courts won't take a case if it comes out of Congress. But that's what you do. You don't go for the bait. We know what happened with the Clinton impeachment. It cost the republicans the `98 election. It would be absolutely what Obama wants.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> All right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER: </b>And then --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> And you think though he's going to provoke that kind of a crisis in this country? You believe that Barack Obama's going to provoke that?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER: </b>Look, the way he spoke today at the press conference, he looked absolutely determined to do it. This is a man seething with anger over what's happened. This is a man who thinks that he's been betrayed by the country. The way he portrayed it in the press conference as if he's been trying to drill his ideas into the population and I don't really get it, in the condescension in which he views the electorate. Of course, if he wins an election, he claims the mandate. If he gets crush in an election, he says, hey, I can't read the tea leaves.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> All right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>KRAUTHAMMER:</b> So he knows what's going on.
