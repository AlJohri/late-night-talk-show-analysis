The \"Times\" saying quote, \"Trying him for desertion and misbehaving before the enemy for allegedly engaging in this conduct that endangered his unit stands to accomplish little at this point. A conviction would most likely deprive a traumatized veteran of benefits including medical care which he will probably need for years. A dishonorable discharge would make it harder to rebuild his life as a civilian. A trial would publicly raise important questions about how Sergeant Bergdahl was allowed into the army and whether there were missed opportunities to avert the crisis his capture created,\" unquote.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>According to the \"New York Times\", Sergeant Bergdahl should be given a pass, an honorable discharge and a check for more than $300,000 which is the back pay he has accrued.
