Yemen yesterday -- at least 137 people killed after two mosques were bombed by savages. Earlier this week, 21 tourists in Tunisia were slaughtered by terrorists. ISIS says they did it. And in Libya ISIS fighters attempting to take over the entire government as there is no central authority in that oil-rich nation.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Perhaps the best expert on fighting terrorism in the Middle East is former CIA chief David Petraeus. He spoke to the \"Washington Post\" about the mess in Iraq. Quote, \"The hard-earned progress of the surge was sustained for over three years. What transpired after that starting in late 2011 came about as a result of mistakes and misjudgments whose consequences were predictable. And there is plenty of blame to go around for that. I would argue that the foremost threat to Iraq's long-term stability and the broader regional equilibrium is not the Islamic state rather it is Shiite militias -- many backed by and some guided by Iran. I'm also profoundly worried that the continuing meltdown of Syria, which is a geopolitical Chernobyl until it is capped it is going to continue to spew radioactive instability and extremist ideology over the entire region,\" unquote.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now, in the face of all the danger and chaos President Obama says he is looking at the long run.

The President is banking on achieving a nuke deal with Iran. He believes can he do that.
