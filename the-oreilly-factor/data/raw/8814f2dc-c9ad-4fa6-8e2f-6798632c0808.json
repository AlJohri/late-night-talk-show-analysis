A new book called \"Madam President\" Nicolle Wallace about the first woman elected to lead America -- it's a novel. As you may remember, Nicolle was a top adviser to Sarah Palin and worked for President Bush the Younger as well. Now, Miss Wallace is on \"The View\". I spoke with her a few days ago.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Do you want to have a woman president?

How many people are running for president on our side? 20?

You know there was one debate that stands out. There was a fight about race. It happened right before the Christmas break. And I went back and watched the show and I never do that but my head was like this flipping back and forth watching them like a violent tennis game.

And Behar did, too. They take it personally when they get upset about something. Then they start to lash out. Elisabeth Hasselbeck was the brunt of Rosie O'Donnell -- unfair.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Last question about it.
