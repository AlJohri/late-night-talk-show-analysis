A new book called \"Believer\" by David Axelrod, very close friend and adviser to President Obama.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Let's begin the segment with race. You write in your book about Reverend Wright. And it was only after, and you point this out. It was only after Wright attacked President Obama in Philadelphia that the President repudiated him and you made that clear in the book. So for years Obama was a close friend of Jeremiah Wright. We all know that he is radical preacher.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Then there is Al Sharpton with a defined history of racial provocation and tax problems -- big time tax problems. And Barack Obama has embraced him. I don't understand any of that. Can you explain it?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>AXELROD:</b> Reverend Wright was his minister and obviously the things -- you call him whatever you call him and obviously some of the things he said were incendiary but that wasn't the relationship that the President had with him. That wasn't -- those weren't the sermons that the President heard in church. Those weren't the sermons that he regularly delivered.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>And, you know, you should also point out he is honored U.S. Marine and he is -- he was and internationally recognized religious leader. So, you know, I think you can characterize him one way or another.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>You characterize him in your own book.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>AXELROD: </b>But the President said -- what the President did was he criticized and very, very clearly the things that Reverend Wright said --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>But only after --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>AXELROD: </b>No, no, no.

He repeated some of the offensive things for which Obama had criticized him and at that point the President said, you know, I'm not going to continue this.
