Police Commissioner Schaeffer instituted a policy called courtesy, professionalism and respect. You will see on every police car in New York City. That would be a specific course they were taught in the police academy and then retaught every two years. We also worked very hard. And this hearkened back to Mayor Couch (ph), Mayor Dinkins, me and Mayor Bloomberg to make our police force a non-majority white police force which it is.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Yes. You recruited minorities. In the nation's largest city and I covered this as a local reporter. Have very few of these incidents, we had one where a guy was killed last year but not so many. This is not a lot of racial tension.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI</b>: I had three.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Three in how many years.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI:</b> Three in eight years.

That case was prosecuted by the way with Loretta Lynch and investigated by Howard Schaffer, our police commissioner.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Uh-hm.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI:</b> He suspended all the police officers in that precinct and he got five of them to testify. We had a second one. And that is one in which the four police officers were found not guilty by a jury, including four blacks and we had a third one in which there was a tape recording, thank goodness, of the police officer almost being killed by the suspect and therefore it was justifiable shooting. So I had a bad one, one that went to a jury and the jury found the police officers not guilty with four blacks on the jury.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI:</b> And then I had one that was totally justified.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Okay.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI:</b> So I know you can have --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Supervision.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI: </b>Of all of these different situations you can have a different set of facts and they don't draw your conclusions until all the facts are in.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Until the facts are. And as mentioned that's why I didn't cover the Minnesota thing right away. Now, when you see something like Minnesota where it's a low level beef, the guy had a brake light out and all of a sudden he is dead, that's how people are going, how can that happen? How can --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI:</b> I'm not defending Minnesota. I don't know that I can. I don't know all the facts. But it doesn't matter if it's a low level arrest or high level arrest. The minute an arrest takes place it's a violent situation if the person doesn't completely submit. Because the police officer becomes nervous about. So, the answer is if the police officer tells you to put your hands up, put your hands up.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>That is the answer.

He has been sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. My posture is Black Lives Matter is exacerbating racial tensions here and by the way they are going about protesting. They are making things worse rather than better. With Martin Luther King, you could see how he was trying to make things better. These people aren't in my opinion. Where do you come down?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI:</b> Well, I agree with it completely. I mean, of course Black Lives Matter but so do blue lives, police officers. So do white lives and Asian lives and Hispanic lives and all lives matter. And if Black Lives matter were truly concerned about Black Lives they would be concerned about black crime. Because although there are some of these incidents that are indefensible by police officers. They are statistically miniscule in comparison to the enormous amount of murder that takes place black on black.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Yes.

Do you know who is there trying to stop that? The police officers who get killed.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Sure. But it's even worse to that with Black Lives Matter. They are protesting right this second in front of the White House. But are they protesting the terrorists who killed the five police officers? No? There is not one side in that whole crew about, you know what? We have got to stop these haters from doing that. Nothing.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI</b>: Well, I have no doubt that my policing strategies Bill Bratton, Michael Schaffer (ph), Bernie Kerik, Michael Bloomberg and Ray Kelly save more black lives than any Black Lives Matter Movement ever save.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: That's because you brought down crime in the poor black neighborhood.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI:</b> By the thousands.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI</b>: By the thousands, Bill. I came in there were 1024 murders and I left Mike with 500 and Mike got it down to 300. Just think over those years how many black people we saved since 70 percent of the people killed in New York City are killed by blacks and by other blacks.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>But the police haters say it's not because of the police.

That's what the police haters say.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI:</b> Well, the police haters are wrong. I mean, police officers Liu and Ramos who were assassinated here in New York City were protecting a black housing development where there was too much crime. And one by the way was Asian and the other was Hispanic.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>Right.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI: </b>And they were there trying to save black lives. And, in fact, New York City police officers over the last 20 years have saved more black lives than any police departments in the United States.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY:</b> Does President Obama have a point when he brings the gun issue to fore when he makes that the central issue rather than terrorism? Does he have a point?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI</b>: No. Guns don't kill. People do. And when people don't have guns they use bombs and when they don't have bombs, they used knives, and when they don't have knives they used other devices. We can see that. We had massive killings in Brussels and Paris very, very strong gun control laws. Here is a perfect comparison. New York City has very strong gun control laws. Chicago has very strong gun controlling laws. Chicago has three-and-a-half times the murders of New York. So, tell me gun control has something to do with it because -- does not.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY: </b>It's how an --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI</b>: Effective policing taking the guns out of the hands of the bad guys is how you stop --</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Drive it down.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>GIULIANI:</b> And second, good community relations and trying to have a representative police department and I am very proud of the fact that the New York City Police Department is a non-majority white police department and I had something to do with that but so that my from two predecessors and my successor.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>O'REILLY</b>: Okay.
