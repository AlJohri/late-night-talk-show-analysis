But as Mr. Trump might say, Hillary Clinton won -- that, I can tell you. She destroyed her main competition Bernie Sanders on the gun issue. Senator Sanders from Vermont, a gun-loving state, has not aggressively fought for gun control something the left fervently wants.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON:</b> Senator Sanders did vote five times since the Brady Bill. Since it was passed more than two million prohibited purchases have been prevented. He also did vote, as he says, for this immunity provision.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Everybody else has to be accountable but not the gun manufacturers.

If the federal government ever allows law suits against gun makers that would destroy the industry as liberal lawyers would sue into bankruptcy. That's how the left wants to get around the Second Amendment just so you know.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>On other issues, the debate was a stalemate. But I couldn't understand the lack of foreign policy questions by CNN. I mean Mrs. Clinton owns much of the foreign policy debacle that has unfolded. But questions about ISIS, for example were few.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>SANDERS:</b> I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLINTON: </b>We don't want American troops on the ground in Syria.

That's code, kind of like Comprehensive Immigration Reform. That's code for amnesty.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Last night it was apparent that neither Sanders nor Clinton have any attention of aggressively confronting ISIS just like President Obama. On the economy, however, none of the Democrats on stage would criticize President Obama directly. But all of them are not happy about the situation.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>SANDERS: </b>Middle class of this country is collapsing.

It's absolutely right. It hasn't been this bad since the 1920s.
