No spec zone. The Trump haters say his campaign work with the Russians to derail Hillary Clinton's chances to be president. That accusation has angered the President and tied up his administration with unwanted controversy. Showing his annoyance the President tweeted over the weekend that he now believes Barack Obama himself ordered phone taps at the Trump Tower.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Now, all hell is breaking loose. Let's look at the facts. Unfortunately, there are only two facts in this whole swamp of accusations. Only two! First, the calls between General Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador were tapped by somebody. And a portion of those conversations were given to \"The Washington Post.\" So, who tapped the call? We don't know.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>Second fact. President Obama allowed Attorney General Loretta Lynch to change the way U.S. Intelligence Agencies share unconfirmed data. That happened in January, just a few days before President Obama left office. It used to be, the intelligence agencies would guard their secrets. Now, the NSA can give them to other agencies, even if the intelligence is not confirmed. The results, leaks sprouting all over the place. Leaks that are damaging to the Trump administration.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>So, why did President Obama change the Intel standards? We don't know. But Donald Trump apparently believes that was to sabotage his incoming administration. That's it. That's the only factual information we can give you. All the rest is blather, opinion, propaganda, speculation. Now, the entire tawdry mass is based on the Russian hacking, which bedeviled the Clinton campaign. As stated, some anti-Trump people accuse the President and his acolytes of working with the Russians. But yesterday, the former director of National Intelligence under President Obama said he found no evidence of that.</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</b></p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>TODD</b>: Does intelligence exists that can definitively answer the following question, whether there were improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p><b>CLAPPER</b>: We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say our, that is NSA, FBI, and CIA, with my office, the director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign at the Russians.
