And I have to say that sometimes when I have listened to less than loving expressions by Christians, I get concerned. So today we celebrate the magnificent glory of our risen savior. I pray that we will live up to his example. I pray that I will live up to his example.

Talking Points does not understand the view of the administration. Does Mr. Obama believe that those opposed to gay marriage are biased against gays? Does he believe those who don't want public funding for abortion are anti-women? Does he believe that those who oppose the nuke deal with Iran want war?</p>                \n                \r\n\n            \n                <p>If he does not believe those things, then what's the beef with allowing religious Americans a legal remedy to state moral objections to mandated policies? What's the beef?
