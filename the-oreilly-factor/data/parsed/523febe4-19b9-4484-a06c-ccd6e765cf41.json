The Pope is resting this evening. Tomorrow he will visit the White House and there's some controversy there.\nQuoting the \"Wall Street Journal\", the Vatican doesn't want Pope Francis to be photographed with people who may oppose tenets of the Catholic Church. As you may know, President Obama has invited some transgender people, some pro-abortion people and other left wing folks to the reception. Wisely the Pope doesn't want to be used in a photo op that might indicate passive endorsement of a point of view the President might hold.\nNow, we have been investigating the situation. We will have more on it tomorrow in our Truth Serum situation. For now it's obvious the Vatican is aware of President Obama's overall agenda and is not endorsing it.\nHowever the Pope is a liberal guy. There's no question about it. But his philosophy is based upon what is good for poor people not on controversial social issues.\nLet's stop with capitalism. November of 2013, the Pope said, quote, \"While the earnings of a minority are growing exponentially, so too is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few. This imbalance is the result of ideologies which defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation. Consequently they reject the right of the states charged with vigilance for the common good to exercise any form of control. A new tyranny is, thus, born.\"\nNow, Pope Francis is correct that some countries -- Russia, China, maybe even his home state of Argentina do allow corrupt crony capitalism where a very few control the wealth. And because of that corruption, most of the people in those countries are poor.\nBut in America, there is strict government regulation of our capitalistic system and many poor Americans have luxury items those in the Third World can only imagine.\nThis is the first time Pope Francis has visited the U.S.A. and I don't believe -- I don't believe he understands our system. I could be wrong on that. But his bottom line on the abuse of capitalism is this, quote, \"The worship of the ancient golden calf has returned in the new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy lacking a truly human purpose.\"\nAgain, that is true. Greed is not good. And there is plenty of it in this world.\nPope Francis has also made it clear that ISIS needs to be stopped. It's not the Pope's job to come up with a military strategy but he has been strong on the issue condemning terrorist killers wherever they are.\nAnd finally the global warming situation. The Pope believes it is a threat to the poor. Quote, \"Climate change is a global problem with grave implications -- environmental, social, economic, political, and for the distribution of goods. if present trends continue this century may well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems with serious consequences for all of us.\"\nNow, that's the Pope's opinion. And he does use the word \"if\". Again, his take is focused on poor people who will starve if, indeed, radical climate envelopes the earth.\nNow, you can disagree with Pope Francis but his motives are clear -- protecting the helpless. \"Talking Points\" believes all Americans should understand and respect the Pope for being a champion of the poor and the persecuted. That is indeed the bottom line of his papacy.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "This afternoon, Pope Francis landed at Andrews Air Force base greeted by President Obama, Vice President Biden and the first lady.
