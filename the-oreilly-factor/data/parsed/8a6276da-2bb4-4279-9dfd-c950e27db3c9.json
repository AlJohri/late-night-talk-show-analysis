This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nO'REILLY: Back in the \"Book\" segment tonight. Let's get right to political analyst Charles Krauthammer who joins us from Washington.\nAll right. You heard the story about the IRS allegations. Are you, Charles Krauthammer, confident that Congress can get to the bottom of this, the new Congress?\nCHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, POLITICAL ANALYST: I'm not confident because I know the administration stonewalls and is very good at stonewalling and the media have no interest in this. However, I do think the House led by Darrell Issa was not very subtle or skilled in its investigation of the IRS scandal. I think the Senate will get a second shot at it, you grant Lois Lerner use immunity, and then she has to testify, otherwise she's in contempt.\nO'REILLY: But she says she doesn't know anything or they didn't do it or I did it, you know how it is.\nKRAUTHAMMER: Well, if she lies, she's in big trouble. Well, I think some of these lies are pretty obvious, if she says, I didn't have anything to do with it, there's quite a lot of evidence. She has to be very careful because if she's given immunity, she's in the clear if she tells the truth.\nO'REILLY: All right. So are you -- you're kind of confident that the Senate is going to come in now, put a little more pressure in conjunction with the House and get this woman to tell what she knows or at least put her in there that she has to say something?\nKRAUTHAMMER: Yes, I think I would have liked to have seen this the first time around. With the house, that opportunity was blown. So we get a second shot. I don't know whether it would actually happen.\nO'REILLY: What about the Attorney General not bringing the case to the grand jury as he's required to do under federal statute?\nKRAUTHAMMER: Look, the Attorney General will be gone in a few weeks. I think going after him is not a very fruitful line of attack. Republicans have to look to 2016, all of this stuff is not going to help them in terms of building the brand and showing they can govern. I'm not against the investigations. It's a good idea. And the IRS scandal is a scandal. However, you got to look to the prize. The prize is the White House and governing the country and changing the direction. That's got to be number one in their minds and that's got to take priority over everything else including investigations.\nO'REILLY: All right. ObamaCare. Now you heard the M.I.T. guy Gruber saying, you know what? We conned everybody. They weren't paying attention. They don't really care. And it's not what it was sold as. And you say?\nKRAUTHAMMER: This is exactly what conservatives have been saying for four years, what we're hearing now is the true voice of liberal arrogance. They believe this. They believe that the voters are stupid, as he said. And they believe that they know the right way, they have to lead the masses to the Promised Land. And they can only do it by deception. And that's what he said openly. We wanted to get the bill. We didn't care about how we did it. So we lied about everything. We lied about if you can keep the plan. Knowing that you can't keep your plan. We lied about the fact this would be a transfer of wealth, a massive transfer of wealth because, as Gruber said, had they known that, it would never have passed. They lied about every aspect of this. And I think that is what has been charged all along and it is a scandal of the media that this has to be discovered in the sixth year of the presidency rather than talked about at the time when it was obvious they were lying about all this. The idea of it being a transfer of wealth was known from the beginning, but they got away with it.\nO'REILLY: But really they didn't get away with it because the new Congress is going to gut the bill, and if there's a new president who is a republican -- and I even think if Hillary Clinton is elected president, they'll have to redo ObamaCare because they're going to tie it around her neck, particularly in a debate situation, around Mrs. Clinton's neck. Are you supporting this? Would you change it? Tell us how. So I don't think ObamaCare is going to last a long time in this country, Charles.\nKRAUTHAMMER: Well, I don't either. And I do think probably the fatal blow will come from the Supreme Court. That's the key thing. In June we will get a ruling on whether the government is allowed to offer subsidies from the federal ObamaCare exchange.\nO'REILLY: Right.\nKRAUTHAMMER: So, without that, it collapses.\nO'REILLY: And people know, and people should know that the Supreme Court justices watch the news, all right? They heard Mr. Gruber, particularly John Roberts, okay, who Gruber now makes look like a fool.\nKRAUTHAMMER: Gruber himself said in a different tape and a different occasion that the intent of the law was only to give subsidies to those people --\nO'REILLY: Right.\nKRAUTHAMMER: -- who signed up on state exchanges. The government's case, which is a flimsy one, is that no, we really intended it to be everybody. Gruber admits -- one of the guys that put the law together -- that it was intentional. It wasn't a typo, it wasn't a mistake.\nO'REILLY: No, and everybody knows that.\nKRAUTHAMMER: And that I think is devastating.\nO'REILLY: Right. Okay, finally President Obama in China, he's chewing gum, he's walking at the same time. He wears a little tunic, a cute little tunic. And you say?\nKRAUTHAMMER: My mother used to say don't chew gum, and that was just in class. Look, the Chinese of all people have been extremely sensitive to the rituals, the decorum, the subtleties, the deference of diplomacy. This goes back 3,000 years. This is not new. In China chewing gum is a sign of disrespect. You're the president of the states. You step out of the limo. You don't chew gum. It is not, you know, the biggest thing in the world, but it does show the combination of the arrogance and the amateurism of a president who in year six at an important summit in China does this -- shows this kind of disrespect and disregard in a setting where it is completely inappropriate.\nO'REILLY: All right, but I don't think he even knew it. I don't think anybody in his entourage even knew it. They don't know anything. They just don't know anything.\nKRAUTHAMMER: Well, when you go to China, somebody can actually look it up. It's not that hard.\nO'REILLY: They could.\nKRAUTHAMMER: But that's the problem. They don't.\nO'REILLY: Charles Krauthammer.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC.
