Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump for the presidency. Over the next few months, we will be bombarded with personal attacks, deception, fraud, fear, and loathing. It all began last night.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nCLINTON: Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHe's not just trying to build a wall between America and Mexico. He is trying to wall off Americans from each other. When he says, let's make America great again, that is code for, let's take America backwards.\nO'REILLY: So here is Hillary Clinton's two-fold campaign strategy. First, to paint Trump as a bigot, a man who despises Latinos, Blacks, women, whomever. Second to portray him as unstable. A president who would bomb Portugal if they tee him off over there. You will hear those reoccurring themes over and over and over. As for Mr. Trump, he said this last night.\nTRUMP: Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund, the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese, all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return. It's a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.\nO'REILLY: Now, on Monday, Mr. Trump says he will have a major corruption speech for us about Hillary Clinton. And his two main campaign points are, first, to portray her as a criminal. And, second, to convince Americans that she will carry on the policies of Barack Obama, which have led to deep disenchantment, especially in the economy. So, there will not be much nuances in the upcoming campaign. Does that matter? Not really. Truth is, most Americans have already made up their minds. There are very few who still are confused over whether Secretary Clinton or Donald Trump is the best candidate. So, it will all be about turnout. That's what's going to decide the election. Also, the end of the primaries means that Bernie Sanders is headed to the locker room. Maybe.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Next Tuesday, we continue the fight in the last primary in Washington, D.C.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nAnd then we take our fight for social, economic, racial and environmental justice to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: So I guess someone forgot to tell the Senator that he got hammered in California last night, a state he thought he would win. There is absolutely no chance that Bernie Sanders will be the Democratic nominee for president. But, put yourself in Bernie's position. What else does he have to do? Unless you are fascinated by cows, hanging around Vermont doesn't offer very much. Yes, can you ski but not in the summer. I guess you could go to the birthplace of Calvin Coolidge. That's up there.\nVermont is beautiful but very, very quiet. Back in Washington, Bernie Sanders never really made much of an impact in the Senate, he did some good work for vets. But that's about it. He is not a player in the Senate body. So Bernie will go on to the convention to get his accolades but you won't be seeing much more of him. Clinton campaign needs Sanders' supporters but, believe me, they don't want the Bern flaming out around them.\nSumming up, nasty campaign ahead, very simple strategies, I hope you get to take a long vacation this summer.
