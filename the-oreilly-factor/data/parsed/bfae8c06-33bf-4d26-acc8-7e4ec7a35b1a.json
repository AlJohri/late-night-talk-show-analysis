The lesson for all of us, there is no privacy in this world. Hackers can get into your system. You can be tape recorded at any time by anybody. You can be photographed about your knowledge and people can even listen to your private conversations while you are in your home using technology.\nWhat an awful situation. Enter Colin Powell, one of the savviest political players in America. The former secretary of state plays both sides of the aisle and has succeeded in doing that for decades. But now hackers have attacked him and the presidential vote may be affected. Speaking about Donald Trump in an email, Powell said this quote, \"There is nothing he can say that will sway black voters. He takes us for idiots. The whole birther movement was racist. And for Trump to say yesterday that within four years he would have 95 percent of blacks voting for him is schizo fantasy,\" unquote.\nNow that should come as no surprise, Colin Powell has never been a fan of Donald Trump. But even though he is a Republican, he is more favorable towards Hillary Clinton or so it seemed. The hackers put this out there, quote, \"Sad thing Hillary Rodham Clinton could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done about the emails. And not tie me into it. I told her staff three times not to try that gam bit. I had to throw a mini tantrum at a Hamptons party to get their attention.\"\nPowell as you may know used private email himself as secretary of state but not nearly to the extent that Mrs. Clinton did. The general continued with another email quote. \"Been having fun with email gate. Hillary's mafia keeps trying to suck me in to it.\" Now, a guy like Colin Powell can be hacked, anybody can. The effect on the vote will probably be minimal. But we can expect more hacking stuff between now and Election Day. Hacking aside, Donald Trump seems to be gaining in the race right now. At least two new polls say that.\nAccording to Reuters, Hillary Clinton's support is now 40 percent, Trump 39 among likely voters. The \"L.A. Times\" daily tracking poll has it 47 for Trump, 42 for Hillary Clinton. It must be going nuts out there in California. Also, new Bloomberg poll has Trump up by five in Ohio. And a Monmouth poll out today of Nevada voters has Trump 44, Clinton 42. Back in July, Mrs. Clinton was up in Nevada by four. While mid-September polls are interesting, the first debate on Monday September 26th is likely to change things. Both candidates know if they lose that debate, they could very well lose the election. Summing up, no privacy on the planet anymore. Colin Powell is embarrassed. The presidential race very tight.
