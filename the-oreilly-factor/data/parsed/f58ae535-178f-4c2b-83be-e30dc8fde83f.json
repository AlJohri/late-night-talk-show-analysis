You remember Miss Merkel was the force behind Germany accepting more than one million refugees. And many on the American left would like to do the same thing here.\nIn fact, there is a new campaign underway right now to rebrand illegal immigrants as economic refugees. According to the polls, most Americans don't want amnesty for illegal aliens but accepting refugees sounds a lot better, doesn't it?\nTomorrow in his state of the union address, the President will have a Syrian refugee sitting with Mrs. Obama -- a message to be sure.\nNow, the sad truth is, oppression is rampant throughout the world. In the face of that the Democratic Party has basically become an open border organization. They oppose a border fence. They support amnesty for millions of illegal aliens already here. They support sanctuary cities that harbor foreigners who violate American law and they oppose Kate's Law which would punish illegal felons who defy deportation.\nThat's a pretty damning resume to most clear-thinking folks.\nIn the past three years women, trying to illegally enter America through the southern border more than doubled to about 120,000 apprehensions in 2014. Unaccompanied children apprehended also doubled to almost 40,000 in 2015. And the left is labeling all of these poor people \"refugees\".\nNow, if you live in Central America, chances are you are economically deprived. According to a survey by Gallup median income in America is about $44,000 a year; in Guatemala it's $4,500; in El Salvador $4,800; Honduras $4,800; Nicaragua $6,500. That's the median income -- half of the people down there taking less. So you can see potential economic refugees are legion.\nAnd then there is the violence. In the U.S.A. the homicide rate is 4.5 people for every 100,000 citizens; in El Salvador it's 69 people for every 100,000; Honduras 66 people. Much of that violence generated by drug gangs who poison their own people and kill at will.\nBy the way Sean Penn not real upset about those drug gangs and we'll get to that in our next segment.\nSumming up, here come the refugees, plenty of them. There are 16 million people in Guatemala alone; eight million in Honduras; six million each in El Salvador and Nicaragua. So you can see where this is going.\nFinally, if you believe in Judeo-Christian philosophy, you must, you must feel sorry for the common person in Central America. Having spent some time down there, I can tell you the poverty is horrific. But I can also tell you that America cannot accept millions of refugees from all over the world.\nWe're just about tapped out here now with the debt approaching $20 trillion. We should do what we can but we must protect our country in the process.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "The worst thing that could happen to the left has happened in Germany -- hundreds of young male refugees from the Middle East and North Africa under suspicion for molesting hundreds of women; the chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, under enormous pressure as well.
