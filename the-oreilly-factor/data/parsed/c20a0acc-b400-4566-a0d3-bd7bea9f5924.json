You\u2019re attacking us!\u201d\nTRUMP: \u201cDon\u2019t be rude. \u00a0No I\u2019m not going to give you a question. \u00a0You are fake news.\u201d\nNow CNN has issued a statement saying quote:\n\"CNN's decision to publish carefully sourced reporting about the operations of our government is vastly different than BuzzFeed's decision to publish unsubstantiated memos.\"\nThe statement continues but you get the idea. \u00a0The press and Donald Trump will be an ongoing soap opera no doubt.\nAs for policy, the national media - still very interested in the Russian hacking deal.\nSo Mr. Trump addressed it:\nTRUMP: \u201cThe Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. \u00a0They did a very poor job. \u00a0They could have had hacking defense, which we had. \u00a0And I must give Reince Preibus credit because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very strong hacking defense.\u201d\nAlso ABC News asked Mr. Trump about Putin:\nTRUMP: \u201cIf Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability. \u00a0Because we have a horrible relationship with Russia. ((EDIT)) Now, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to get along with Vladimir Putin. \u00a0I hope I do. \u00a0But there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t. \u00a0And if I don\u2019t, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? \u00a0Does anyone in this room really believe that?\u201d\nThen it was on to Obamacare which as we reported last night is toast.\nTRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019re going to do repeal and replace. \u00a0Very complicated stuff. \u00a0And we\u2019re going to get a health bill passed. \u00a0We\u2019re going to get healthcare taken care of in this country. \u00a0You have deductibles that are so high.\u201d\nWhat the Republicans propose in place of Obamacare will of course be a major story.\nMuch of the press conference dealt with Donald Trump's business dealings. He's putting a lot of stuff in trusts and handing operations of his company over to his two sons.\nLou Dobbs will have some thoughts on that coming up.\nBut then it got back to the Trump controversies. Front and center -- the wall on the southern border.\nTRUMP: \u201cMexico, in some form and there are many different forms, will reimburse us for the cost of \u00a0the wall. \u00a0That will happen. \u00a0Whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment\u2014probably less likely that it\u2019s a payment. \u00a0But it will happen.\u201d\nMr. Trump says he will begin building the wall shortly after he takes office on January 20th.\nMexico also got more bad news because the president-elect once again said he is going to institute a so-called border tax which would punish American companies operating in Mexico and other countries who try to ship their products back to the USA.\nTRUMP: \u201cThere will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. \u00a0And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. \u00a0And you\u2019d have a million more workers right now.\u201d\nSo all in all there was a lot of substance in the press conference.\nMr. Trump's demeanor was direct. \u00a0I saw no difference in him today than when he was campaigning.\nHe stated his case with authority. \u00a0He was blunt and he continues to say he'll do what he promised to do.\nAs for the press - they are still fixated on the election.\nThere's no question in my mind that the hunt for a Trump-Russia connection during the campaign remains intense.\nSome in the national media wanting to de-legitimize the vote.\nAnd at this point, that's the only way to do it.\nSumming up, Donald Trump helped himself today, but he'd better watch his back.\nNot since Richard Nixon has the national press corps been so determined to bring someone down.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "About 250 reporters faced the president-elect in New York City today, and many major points were made.\nSo let's run them down.\nThe issue of fake news, fabricated reports about not only Donald Trump, but public figures in general, was front and center.\nThe issue began yesterday when BuzzFeed, an internet site, released a so-called report that attacked Donald Trump in a personal way and also implied that his campaign had secret dealings with Russia.\nThere was no evidence put forth in those assertions.\nMost news organizations, including Fox, stayed away from the report.\nEarlier CNN did pick it up, the general thread of the story, and that angered Mr. Trump.\nHe was also agitated that U.S. intelligence agencies in the past have leaked stuff:\nTRUMP: \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace. \u00a0And I say that, and I say that, and that\u2019s something that Nazi Germany would have done, and did do. \u00a0I think it\u2019s a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public. \u00a0As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it I think they\u2019re going to suffer the consequences. \u00a0They already are. \u00a0And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up.\u201d\nA few minutes later a CNN reporter tried to ask Mr. Trump a question.\nJIM ACOSTA, CNN REPORTER: \u201cMr. President-elect since you are attacking our news organization can you give us a chance?\u201d\nTRUMP: \u201cNot you. \u00a0Not you.\u201d\nACOSTA: \u201cYou are attacking our news organization.\u201d\nTRUMP: \u201cYour organization is terrible.\u201d\nACOSTA: \u201cSir can you \u2013\u201c\nTRUMP: \u201cQuiet. \u00a0She\u2019s asking a question. \u00a0Don\u2019t be rude.\u201d\nACOSTA: \u201cCan you give us a question?
