The looters and arsonists sent a strong message that anarchy and destruction are tools to be used in protests.\nSome national TV networks reported most of the demonstrators were not violent but that is false. Once you see crimes being committed in any situation, you must walk away or you become part of the violent mob, part of the criminal activity.

It set back race relations in America years. The violent protests actually created more bias against blacks. Most Americans deplore the tactics of violence even if they agree with the protest cause. I know many African-Americans who are appalled at the display well understanding the violent images in Ferguson, Missouri alienated good people who are sympathetic to the concept of equal justice for all.\n\"Talking Points\" has documented how rare police killings of Americans really are no matter what the color. 99.9 percent of all police arrests do not result in a fatality.\nBut the racial agitators are having none of that. Writing in \"The New York Times\" yesterday, Georgetown University professor and MSNBC analyst Michael Eric Dyson says, quote, \"As for the plague of white cops who kill unarmed black youth, the facts of which are tediously and sickeningly repetitive and impose a psychological tariff on black minds, the President was vague, halting and sincerely noncommittal.\" Dyson went on to call President Obama a traitor to his race for not siding with the violent demonstrators who in Dyson's view have a legitimate right to destroy at will.\nLet's take a good look at this plague of white cops acting violently against blacks as Dyson puts it. In the past 50 years, the rate of black Americans killed by police has dropped 70 percent. In 2012, 123 African- Americans were shot dead by police. There are currently more than 43 million blacks living in the U.S.A. Same year, 326 whites were killed by police bullets. Those are the latest stats available.\nIn 2013, blacks committed 5,375 murders in America; whites committed 4,396. Whites comprise 63 percent of the population; blacks 13 percent. So, anyone -- anyone thinking clearly can see that the homicide rate among blacks way out of proportion thus, the police intrusion into black precincts. Since, in a whopping 90 percent of black homicides, the dead person is another black or the offender himself.\nMichael Eric Dyson and his soul mates will tell you it is white America's fault the black homicide rate is so high. He will call you racist if you cite the statistic. He will label you a white supremacist as he did to Rudy Giuliani if you suggest that law abiding black Americans organize against black on black crime.\nThe grand jury in Missouri, regular folks examined the evidence, decided against indicting Officer Wilson. Maybe they made a mistake -- it's possible. Human beings are fallible. But the lynch mob that Michael Eric Dyson, Al Sharpton and other demagogues advocate is a far more obvious mistake. That mistake should be clear to everyone.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "By rampaging through the streets of Ferguson, Missouri last week those who believe Police Officer Darren Wilson should have been charged with murder for shooting Michael Brown brought worldwide attention to their cause.
