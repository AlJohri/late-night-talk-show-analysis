\u00a0 Isn't it true that innocent people, human beings are being slaughtered by evil doers, using the name of God to do their killing? \u00a0So if that is true, it's a good versus evil moral situation that we absolutely need religious leaders like Pope Francis did this week to speak out and tell the politicians you have got to stop it.\nVANCE-TREMBATH: \u00a0I certainly agree with that. \u00a0One of the roles of religion is to name evil. \u00a0\nO'REILLY: \u00a0I'm glad you agree with that.\nNow, Rabbi, Jews all over the world are target number 1 for these jihadists. \u00a0And I'm asking every rabbi and every Jewish leader to come together and demand that President Obama and the other Western leaders do something about it. \u00a0Am I wrong? \u00a0\nRABBI MARVIN HIER, SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER: \u00a0You are absolutely right, Bill. \u00a0These are not random acts. \u00a0It's true that the majority of the world's Muslim population are against jihad. \u00a0But a whopping minority, according to the Pew study, 22 percent are in favor of a form of jihad. \u00a0Now what does that mean? \u00a0That means that it could be if you look at the numbers that more people are in favor of jihad than represented the Axis Powers in 1939 when they took on Western civilization. \u00a0That is a pandemic. \u00a0\nO'REILLY: \u00a0Yes. \u00a0I don't know if people understand a million and a half, billion and a half Muslims around the world if you have got 22 percent of them saying yes, we are going to kill Christians and Jews because we want to impose our perverted twisted sense of religion you have a major problem.\nLet me ask you this though Rabbi. \u00a0Some of the opposition to aggressive action against ISIS and al Qaeda comes from the left and the far left in America -- the progressive movement, which is very popular among some American Jews. \u00a0How do you explain that? \u00a0\nHIER: \u00a0Listen, I can't speak for them. \u00a0That's not my point of view, Bill. \u00a0I want to say very clearly that had the world listened to Winston Churchill in the 30s, 50 million peoples' lives would have been spared. \u00a0 You know, when I see this appeasement and the fact that no one is willing to call it what it is, this is a war against Islamic fundamentalism, not mentioning the name does a disservice to the battle.\nWho are we fighting? \u00a0We are not fighting millions of Christians who are terrorists we are not fighting millions of Jews who are terrorists. \u00a0We happen to be fighting a significant minority of Islamic fundamentalists that are perverting their religion and it will take the rest of the Muslim population, those who are against jihad, to aggressively take them on. \u00a0\nO'REILLY: \u00a0I agree 100 percent with that.\nNow, Professor Trembath, religion by its very nature in America is peace-loving. \u00a0All right -- both the Christian faith and the Jewish faith, there aren't many Muslim Americans. \u00a0I think a million and a half here. \u00a0 But Muslim Americans aren't violent people. \u00a0I mean very, very little violence in those communities.\nBut now we are calling for people of faith and clerics in America to demand that Washington protect innocent people from evil. \u00a0And I think a lot of religious leaders are very uneasy to do that. \u00a0\nVANCE-TREMBATH: \u00a0Well, it's certainly -- I mean I agree with you that that there is a long strain in the Judeo-Christian tradition that pushes back against violence -- to the widow, the orphan, the stranger, the marginalized. \u00a0That's a central feature of the truth claim we make about reality as Christian, Jews and Muslims who believe that the human person has the distinct reality of being the intersection of the human and divine. \u00a0 That God dwells in the activities of loving and knowing and hoping and doing good and creating beauty.\nI mean Muslims, Jews and Christians all share that truth claim about reality. \u00a0That is certainly true and sometimes that doing goodness requires us to push back against violence. \u00a0It's complicated in how we work it out. \u00a0\nO'REILLY: \u00a0It's evil. \u00a0\nRabbi, I'm going to let you close out the segment. \u00a0Am I wrong for doing this Rabbi? \u00a0I'm putting pressure on my religion, the Catholic Church, which I think has been very weak. \u00a0I think Pope Francis as I said has been strong but in America very, very weak on this. \u00a0They don't preach in the pulpit. \u00a0They are afraid. \u00a0I'm putting pressure on my people.\nAnd I'm calling for protestants and Jews this weekend to stand up and level with their congregations that there is evil it's killing people and you have to confront President Obama and congress. \u00a0You have got to tell them this has got to stop. \u00a0And the world has to unite against it.\nJust as you said with the Nazis, if the world had united against it in the 30s that wouldn't have happened. \u00a0They didn't. \u00a0It's exactly the same thing. \u00a0Last word -- Rabbi. \u00a0\nHIER: \u00a0You are absolutely right. \u00a0The Almighty was a realist. \u00a0The Ten Commandments are equally divided five positive, five negative. \u00a0Why is that? \u00a0Because God knew this is the planet earth, evil exists. \u00a0You can't just be a do-gooder if you are not prepared to stand up and take on evil. \u00a0That is what is required at this moment in history. \u00a0\nO'REILLY: \u00a0All right. \u00a0We appreciate you both. \u00a0Very good debate.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.
