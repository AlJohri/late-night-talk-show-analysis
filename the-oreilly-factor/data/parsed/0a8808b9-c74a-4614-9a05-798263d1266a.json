Can the presidential candidates solve dangerous problems?", "description": "'The O'Reilly Factor': Bill O'Reilly's Talking Points 11/2", "date": "2016-11-03T11:41:36Z", "full_transcript": "With five days left in the campaign, both candidates are ramping up the rhetoric.\nI think it would be fair to say that both Trump and Clinton know what the problems are, but have mostly put forth general solutions.\nHere's a prime example.\nSpeaking in Florida yesterday, Hillary Clinton spotlighted the danger that some young Americans face on the streets where they live.\nMrs. Clinton apparently believing the gun threat is upending society:\nHILLARY CLINTON: \u201cSomething is wrong when young people just staring their lives are dying. \u00a0Something is wrong when so many parents live in fear that their child will be hurt or killed, going to the movies, sitting in a first-grade classroom, attending a Bible study. \u00a0The list goes on. \u00a0This has nothing to do with the Second Amendment and responsible gun owners.\u201d\nWhat Hillary Clinton has to know is that so far this year in the city of Chicago, 585 people have been killed and 3,100 wounded by gun fire.\nMost of those poor, black Americans.\nBut the problem is not gun control.\nChicago and the state of Illinois have strict gun-possession measures.\nBut obviously the thugs who are shooting people don't really care about those measures.\nTherefore it is a total waste of time for Hillary Clinton or any politician to say that more gun control measures are going to solve the problem of street violence.\nThere is a solution but neither Clinton nor Trump has mentioned it.\nIn the USA anyone committing any crime with a gun, even simple illegal possession, should be subject to federal mandatory prison sentences.\nAll gun crimes should become federal crimes.\nThat means that if cops in Chicago find a gang member or anybody else carrying an illegal weapon, they will be prosecuted by a U.S. Attorney.\nAnd if convicted, serve at least five years in a federal penitentiary.\nThat way American law enforcement could take not only guns off the streets but people who illegally carry them and-or use them to commit crimes.\nAnd the upshot -- pardon the pun -- is that legal gun owners would be left alone.\nNow this is a simple solution, but Hillary Clinton would never support it.\nBecause she and many other liberals believe there are too many Americans in prison, and we should be more understanding of criminal behavior.\nThat mindset has led to the carnage we have in cities like Chicago, Baltimore and St. Louis.\nTalking Points does not know whether Donald Trump would support federalizing gun crimes.\nBut he should.\nMr. Trump has been endorsed by the NRA and says he will uphold the rights of Americans to defend themselves with firearms.\nBut he and every other politician must know that criminals can easily get guns and that situation has to be confronted.\nSo when we vote for president next Tuesday, we might think about candidates who really want to solve problems as opposed to candidates who just want to blow smoke.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [],
