I'm simply interested in seeing if presidential candidates are really looking out for you. I believe you guys should be able to make up your own minds about who did well and who did not do well in the debates.\nBut as I said last night after all the verbiage is over there isn't all that much difference among the Republican contenders except for Rand Paul and John Kasich. Senator Paul doesn't really seem to see the urgency of the chaos overseas. And Governor Kasich is running on a humanitarian conservative platform in an age of deep anger against liberal tenets. Therefore, I believe those two candidates will not succeed, at least not this year.\nThat leaves six viable contenders for the Republican nomination. If you believe the pundits, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz gained momentum last night. Donald Trump and Ben Carson held their own. Carly Fiorina and Jeb Bush scored some points but not enough to overtake or challenge the leaders.\nThough one after debate comment that struck me as completely ludicrous was this:\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nCOSTELLO: So Dana, what was the mood like in that room because it appeared to me the moderators didn't ask very challenging questions?\nDANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think obviously that depends on who you're talking about.
