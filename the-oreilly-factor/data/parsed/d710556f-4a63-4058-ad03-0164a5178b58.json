(EDIT) America is better. \u00a0The world is better. And stay with me now -- race relations are better since I graduated.\"\nThe problem is race relations are now on the decline. \u00a0The core constituency of Donald Trump is white, working class - primarily men.\nThey feel that the federal government no longer speaks for them, that they are the ones getting hammered by a growing nanny state heavy on grievance - only not their grievance.\nThe president made a passing reference to middle-aged white guys and how they should be understood. \u00a0But at this point words are meaningless.\nThe Obama doctrine of income redistribution has made it tougher on the working and middle classes as they watch salaries stagnate and health insurance costs rise under ObamaCare.\nOf course, none of that is the fault of African-Americans. \u00a0It is the government who has alienated so many white working folks by basically ignoring them.\nThe second point - Mr. Obama made plays into the first one:\nOBAMA: \"We've got a justice gap when too many black boys and girls pass through a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails. \u00a0This is one area where things have gotten worse. \u00a0When I was in college, about half a million people in America were behind bars. \u00a0Today, there are about 2.2 million. \u00a0Black men are about six times likelier to be in prison right now than white men.\"\nSo why are there so many more Americans in prison? \u00a0Three reasons: father's abandoning their children, a culture that glorifies crude and sometimes criminal behavior, and the illegal narcotics industry - much of it based in poor areas.\nNone of those things were mentioned by the president.\nThe cold truth is there has been a failure to lead on culture and family issues, and that has led to bad behavior being excused and sometimes even accepted.\nAmerican society has grown so permissive and politically correct that solving poverty is almost impossible now.\nAnyone who raises questions about so-called \"entertainment\" that instructs children to reject civil behavior is immediately attacked in vile ways. \u00a0Anyone lamenting the African-American out-of-wedlock birthrate risks being branded a racist.\nI know for a fact that Mr. Obama understands and is appalled by the culture swamp. \u00a0Why then isn't he attacking it?\nAs for schools, we continue to pour record amounts of money into public education but nothing gets better.\nWhy? \u00a0Because the system refuses to provide discipline, direction or competition through school vouchers for the poor.\nThat's why!\nThird point:\nOBAMA: \"We cannot be ignorant of history. (Applause.) We can't meet the world with a sense of entitlement. \u00a0We can't walk by a homeless man without asking why a society as wealthy as ours allows that state of affairs to occur. \u00a0We can't just lock up a low-level dealer without asking why this boy, barely out of childhood, felt he had no other options.\"\nRight out of the progressive playbook. \u00a0No other options but to sell drugs? \u00a0Come on.\nWhat an insult to the millions of young people of all colors working their butts off in fast food joints all across the country, or other entry level jobs - kids trying to build a resume of hard work, not taking the immoral, lazy way out by committing crimes on the street corner.\nAs for the homeless, there is usually a reason and many times it's personal self-destruction that no free society can prevent.\nChina often isolates people who refuse to be responsible but we in America don't do that, even in cases of acute mental illness.\nIndividual rights trump dysfunction in our county, thus the homeless problem.\nFinally the fourth point:\nOBAMA: \"It's thanks in large part to the activism of young people like many of you, from Black Twitter to Black Lives Matter, that America's eyes have been opened -- white, black, Democrat, Republican -- to the real problems, for example, in our criminal justice system. \u00a0But to bring about structural change, lasting change, awareness is not enough.\"\nBig mistake - and rhetoric that is driving the Trump vote.\nBlack Lives Matter is a radical group that has little use for free speech, as both Bernie Sanders and the Clintons have found out:\nSANDERS: \"Thank you Seattle for being one of the most progressive cities in the United States of America!\" (Black Lives Matter protesters take the stage)\n((EDIT))\nPROTESTER TO SANDERS: \"If you do not listen to her your event will be shut down right now!\"\n((EDIT))\nHILLARY CLINTON: \"I think we've got somebody saying here -\"\nPROTESTER: \"We want you to apologize for mass incarceration.\"\nHILLARY CLINTON: \u00a0\"Ok we'll talk about ...\"\nPROTESTER: \"I'm not a super predator Hillary Clinton,\"\nHILLARY CLINTON: \"Okay fine, we'll talk about it.\"\nPROTESTER: \"Will you apologize to black people for mass incarceration?\"\n((EDIT))\nBILL CLINTON: \"You are defending the people who kill the people whose lives you say matter. \u00a0Tell the truth. \u00a0You are defending the people who cause young people to go out and take guns.\"\nMost Americans are appalled at intrusions like that, not to mention insanity like this: August protests in Minnesota\nBLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTERS: \"Pigs in a blanket! Fry 'em like bacon!\"\nPresident Obama's support of Black Lives Matter indirectly tells college graduates that radical intrusions are acceptable.\nThat, of course, creates an enormous wedge between his supporters and more traditional Americans - again fueling the rise of a candidate like Donald Trump.\nIronically, earlier in the speech, the president chastised those who disinvite certain people to college campuses, saying all responsible voices deserve to be heard. \u00a0So what about the Black Lives Matter shout downs, Mr. President?\nThe truth is some reforms need to be made on the justice, racial and social fronts, but the core issues of poverty and injustice are not being addressed effectively because of politics and P.C. out of control.\nUntil those in power stop pandering and begin developing tough, fair-to-all policies, the growing divide in America will keep growing.\nVoters who support Trump are sending a powerful message that President Obama and the young Americans who revere him should seriously think about.\nThese are the words that truly matter - equal justice for all.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "Talking Points enjoyed watching the president's speech to the graduating class of Howard University on Saturday. \u00a0It was interesting and delivered with energy.\nMr. Obama's words were important because they addressed the division that we are seeing in America - a divide that has catapulted Donald Trump to the Republican nomination.\nThere are four speech points I would like to analyze tonight, beginning with the status of black Americans:\nOBAMA: \"In 1983, I was part of fewer than 10 percent of African-Americans who graduated with a bachelor's degree. \u00a0Today, you're part of the more than 20 percent who will. \u00a0And more than half of blacks say we're better off than our parents were at our age -- and that our kids will be better off, too.
