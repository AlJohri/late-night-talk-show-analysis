As we predicted weeks ago, Hillary Clinton will be running against Donald Trump for the presidency unless she is indicted over the email scandal. So, let's take a look at who has the advantage right now. An analysis of the Electoral College by \"The Washington Post\" says that if Mrs. Clinton wins all the states, Democrats traditionally win, plus D.C., she only needs to win Florida to become president.\nBut that is a bit simplistic because Donald Trump should be more competitive in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, than Mitt Romney was. However, there is no question, no question Mrs. Clinton is a favorite to win at the moment. Even talk radio Republicans are split on Trump.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nLIMBAUGH: My instinctive feeling right now is that Trump is going to win, beat Hillary badly, that it could be landslide proportions. I still don't think people understand why Trump won this. I don't think they understand at all the reason people support Trump.\nGLENN BECK, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Because Donald Trump is the GOP candidate, and I believe Hillary Clinton is going to win because of this, you will never elect another GOP person to high office ever again. Because, what's going to happen is you are now going to have Hillary Clinton legalize as many voters as you can.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Right now you can throw out the primary votes out of the window. About 20 percent of voting age Americans participated in the primaries, leaving the vast number of Americans still to be heard. Mr. Trump's support is fervent and that will help him. Secretary Clinton's support more tepid. However her advantage in the minority precincts among women is substantial and Miss Clinton is putting forth as she is not going to take any guff from Donald Trump.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nCLINTON: If he wants to go back to the playbook of 1990s. If he wants to follow in the footsteps of those that are tried to knock me down and take me out of the political arena, I'm more than happy to have him do that. This is, to me, a classic case of a blustering bullying guy who -- who has knocked out of the way all the Republicans because they were just dumbfounded.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: For his part, Mr. Trump told me last night he is more than happy to take the low road if Hillary Clinton attacks him. That sets up a very unpredictable race. And remember, a debate between Clinton and Trump will be the most watched political event in history I predict. So, summing up anything could happen. But Hillary Clinton has to be considered the favorite today.
