But even though Kate's Law will likely come up again for a vote, it seems certain most Democrat senators will not support the measure that's designed to protect all Americans from thugs like the guy who shot and killed Kate Steinle in San Francisco.\nAs you may know, that illegal alien had seven felony convictions, came back six times after being deported. I mean it's insane. Nevertheless, Democrat senators like crazy left Sherrod Brown in Ohio oppose mandatory five-year prison terms for such individuals. Brown saying, quote, to his constituency: \"The mandatory minimum sentences established under this bill, Kate's Law, would waste taxpayer money by increasing the federal prison population.\" Yes, that's right, Senator. Convicted aggravated felons who defy deportation would wind up in prison under Kate's Law instead of running around sanctuary cities like San Francisco selling drugs and shooting young women in the head. Brown is a disgrace. How Ohioans ever elected him is a mystery of the universe.\nNow, as talking points reported yesterday, Americans overwhelmingly support Kate's Law. Think about it. Who would oppose the law? Who would oppose this? I can't figure this out. Democrat senators like Bob Casey, Dianne Feinstein, Patrick Leahy, Claire McCaskill, Bill Nelson -- these people should openly embrace Kate's Law. Instead, they remain silent and will remain so unless pressured by their constituents. On that front, I'm not hopeful.\nLast week a guy from the Media Research Center went to a pro- immigration rally in Colorado.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you heard of Kate's Law?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you heard of Kate Steinle?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you ever heard of Kate's Law?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I have not.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't like you asking the people here the questions that you are asking.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: See, we got it he doesn't like the questions.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ok.
