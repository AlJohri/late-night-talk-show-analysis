that all Americans should have access to quality healthcare.\nBut the execution of Obamacare put a steep burden on working-class families.\nAs we all know, health insurance premiums are up, deductibles are up, and doctors accepting the health mandate are becoming fewer and fewer.\nThere is no question Obamacare will be repealed under President Trump and we all have to hope that the Republicans have a better plan.\nOn the economic front, Mr. Obama did a good job in his first year stabilizing the economy, which was in a free fall because of the mortgage-con that led to recession.\nFor example, he made the right decision bailing out some of the American carmakers, who have since repaid the feds.\nBut then Mr. Obama shifted into massive income redistribution mode.\nThat meant that taxes went up, regulations went up, welfare payments went up and the economy stagnated.\nFor eight years, the wages and the economy stagnated.\nThat's why Donald Trump won the election. \u00a0The economics on President Obama's watch were not successful.\nPeriod.\nNow let's go overseas. \u00a0There the president made five major mistakes.\nThe worst one - withdrawing all U.S. troops from Iraq.\nThat led to the rise of ISIS, which Mr. Obama ignored and now we have a disaster, not only inside Iraq, but worldwide.\nSecond was Syria.\nAfter the tyrant Assad used poison gas on innocent people, Mr. Obama threatened Assad.\nBut the threat was hollow. \u00a0Mr. Obama did nothing.\nAnd so hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed, brutalized or have fled.\nThat has destabilized Europe and led to even more terrorism.\nOn the Russia front, Mr. Obama was totally impotent in the face of the tyrant Putin.\nThe former KGB officer did exactly what he wanted to do, including invading countries and hacking into the American political system.\nAlso, the Chinese do not fear Barack Obama and have now made the South China Sea international water their own.\nThe Chinese have also undermined the American economy, as Donald Trump has so often pointed out.\nFinally, the nuke treaty with Iran is still debatable.\nWhat is not debatable is that Iran is the primary sponsor of terrorism in the world, including the direct destabilizing of countries in the Mideast and Afghanistan.\nThe Iranians do not fear Barack Obama.\nIn international matters, it is clear that President Obama believes that global warming is more important than stabilizing and protecting the world in the face of a global jihad.\nNow, global warming is real, climate change is occurring. \u00a0But Mr. Obama's vision of hurting certain economic sectors in order to lessen fossil fuel intrusion cannot possibly work unless countries like India and China do the same thing.\nAnd they are not.\nSo, Mr. Obama imposed regulations that hurt the American economy knowing full well that climate change would not improve worldwide.\nDoes that make any sense?\nAt this point in history, two thirds of the American people think America is on the wrong track.\nBut they still like Barack Obama. \u00a0His approval ratings are above 50%.\nThat is to the president's credit. \u00a0He has put forth an image of responsibility.\nBut as the nation's leader, Mr. Obama has not improved the economy to any significant extent, has not diminished poverty and poor education, has not brought Americans together, and has used the power of this great nation in a way that has created mayhem abroad. \u00a0That is the historical record.\nAnd it has nothing to do with ideology, or wishful thinking.\nIt has to do with performance.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "About an hour from now, Barack Obama will deliver his farewell address. \u00a0After eight years in office, he believes he has been successful.\nOthers dissent.\nThe Wall Street Journal editorializing today:\n\"Yet (Barack Obama's) presidency has been a disappointment at home and abroad, a fact ironically underscored by Mr. Obama's relentless insistence that he has been a success.\"\nSo now Talking Points would like to assess, and present the facts, about President Obama on the job.\nFirst of all, some of you believe I have been too easy on Mr. Obama.\nOver the years, I've received letters like these:\nFEB. 8, 2011: Matthew Richards, Natick, Massachusetts: \"Mr. O, I didn't realize that you were the new spokesman for the White House.\"\n((EDIT))\nFEB. 3, 2014: Loreen Rorex, Johnson City, Tennessee, \"Bill, you threw soft balls at the president.
