Fifty nine missiles hit their targets. The goal is to destroy an air base from which Syrian planes recently dropped sarin gas on civilians, killing 30 children. Thirty.\nAnd 20 women, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. According to reporting based on a variety of agencies, this is the fifth time, at least, the fifth time, Syrian Dictator Assad has violated the Geneva Conventions and use poison gas to kill civilians. Back in 2012, President Barack Obama threatened Assad.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The use of chemical weapons is and would be totally unacceptable. And if you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons, there will be consequences and you will be held accountable.\nO'REILLY: But Assad was not held accountable. Instead, the Obama administration did what it always did, talk, and announced a deal with the dictator. A fascinating footnote to that is that Susan Rice was on point alongside John Kerry.\nSUSAN RICE, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: We were able to find a solution that actually removed the chemical weapons that were known from Syria in the way that use of force would never accomplish.\nJOHN KERRY, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: With respect to Syria, we struck a deal where we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Obviously a false belief on Mr. Kerry's part. Now for years, Assad has been protected by the Russians who were warned of the attack was coming last night so they could get their personnel out of the airfield.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: Russia should be embarrassed and ashamed. They are the one that are telling the world that there were no nerve agents, that there were no chemical weapons left. We know that for the better part of this year, Assad has been using chlorine bombs against the innocent civilians and population centers. And now yesterday a couple of days ago, the nerve agent sarin. And so, the Russians have been covering for Assad, and if it were not for the Russians, Assad would not still be in power.\nO'REILLY: That's true. Putin continues to prop up Assad while thousands of people die and at least five million Syrians, five million are refugees. Most sane people support the missile attack last night. Saying is the key word here.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nRON PAUL, FORMER TEXAS CONGRESSMAN: It doesn't make any sense for Assad and these conditions to all of a sudden use poison gases? I think it's zero chance that he would have done this, you know, deliberately.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Former congressman apparently believing Assad was set up by someone. Now the morality of the attack is certainly acceptable when you have war crimes being openly committed. A noble nation will confront that. Unfortunately, noble nations are in short supply these days, and the USA is an exception to that. Also, America's National Security is in play because poison gas can be used by terrorists.\nAssad has a very close relationship with Iran and Hezbollah. Once chemical weapons become acceptable, the world will becomes a very dangerous place. More dangerous that it is now. Talking Points has said for years that Assad's Air Force should have been destroyed a long time ago, and NATO should of established safe zones inside Syria to protect the innocent.\nUnder President Obama, none of that was remotely possible because of his strategy of retreat. But now, the new President Donald Trump ascending a message to the world, USA will not tolerate war crimes from nations like Syria. The downside is for every action is a reaction, so security has tightened here in the USA as we become an even bigger target for evildoers.\nSumming up, America was justified in destroying the Syrian airport. World nation should be dealt with by the world. But if they are not the lone superpower has a responsibility. Even most of the Trump haters in Congress agree that if we can stop children from being gassed to death, we should do so.
