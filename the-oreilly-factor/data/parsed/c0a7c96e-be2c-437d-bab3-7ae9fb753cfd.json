Turkey ISIS suspected but no matter who committed the atrocity, they are evil. As stated, President Obama's policy towards Islamic terrorism is to try to contain it. And while speaking to avoid the actual description Islamic terrorism. Mr. Obama has killed terror leaders with drones. Has bombed ISIS facilities in Iraq and Syria. Has ordered American special forces to disrupt ISIS activities but it is not enough.\nThe solution to defeating is to quickly kill as many of them on the ground as possible. Sending a strong message to the world of jihad. As talking points has stated before, NATO the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be leading the cause not the Kurds, not some phantom coalition Mr. Obama uses to obscure real action. The ISIS attack on Paris killed 130 human beings. The terror groups attacks in Belgium killed 32. Now, in Turkey more than 40 people are dead.\nAll three of those countries are members of NATO. All three of those attacks are acts of war. Article five in the NATO charter says, an attack on one country is an attack on all. So, why is President Obama not advocating NATO forces on the ground to kill the ISIS savages and protect suffering civilians who are desperate? Again, why is he not promoting that strategy? The Turkish border is just 50 miles away from the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria.\nIt is long past time for all Americans to understand that ISIS is not going to stop killing innocent people and you could be one of those innocent people. It is true that no matter what action is taken against the jihadists, terrorism will not stop. It's impossible to wipe it out entirely. But it is not that difficult to run these savages out of their sanctuaries. But the President will not do it.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nPRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: Groups like ISIL can't destroy us. They can't defeat us. They don't produce anything. They're not an existential threat to us.\nOur mission is to destroy ISIL. Since I last updated the American people on our campaign two months ago, we have seen that this continues to be a difficult fight but we are making significant progress.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Today Mr. Obama spoke about the ISIS attack in Istanbul. Saying we stand with the people of Turkey. More empty rhetoric. We don't stand with anyone. We will not do what is necessary to defeat this evil. The ISIS battle should be a major presidential campaign issue if Hillary Clinton is going to continue the policies of Barack Obama, every American should know that. On the other side Donald Trump needs to get very specific about his plan to defeat ISIS and the jihadi. He should spell it out. And that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["PRES.
