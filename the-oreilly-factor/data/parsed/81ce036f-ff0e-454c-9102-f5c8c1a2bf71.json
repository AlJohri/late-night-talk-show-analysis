That is likely to rise even further this week.\nWhen CBS asked, do you approve or disapprove of the U.S. launching missiles against Syria?\n57% approve\n36% disapprove\n8% don't know.\nDo you have confidence in Donald Trump's ability to handle the situation in Syria?\n41% confident\n54% not confident\nAnd finally, do you think it's necessary for Congress to approve any further U.S. action in Syria?\nA whopping 69% say it is that Congress should get involved.\n25% do not feel it's necessary.\nThere are a number of developments on the military front.\nU.S. warships are heading toward the Korean Peninsula because the nutty dictator of that country continues to test ballistic missiles in violation of international law.\nAlso the two U.S. warships in the eastern Mediterranean continue to monitor Syria.\nThere's also an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, the George H.W. Bush.\nSo you can see that President Trump and the Pentagon are sending signals that if world order is threatened, America will respond.\nIt's just a damn shame that we are the only country willing to take this stand.\nThere is no reason for Russia to prop up Assad in Syria, the man is a war criminal.\nAlso, China does not try to control the North Korea situation when it absolutely could.\nStaunch allies like Britain, Australia, Canada and France do help us out, but it's on a limited basis.\nUnfortunately policing the world falls to America, with all the danger and expense that entails.\nPresident Trump would be wise to pick his spots. The attack on Syria worked and was approved by most in the world who care about protecting innocent people.\nYes, Russia and Iran are now threatening the USA, but so what? Those countries have thrown in with the devil, and we cannot back away from their bluster.\nHowever, a confrontation with Russia is not what anybody needs, so President Trump would be wise to talk to Putin quietly and try to get the guy to wise up by helping his economy.\nIran is truly a hopeless situation, but the mullahs do not want to commit suicide. How the nuke treaty will eventually play out is one of the great world mysteries.\nIt is likely that North Korea will be the next problem we have to deal with.\nIf they test a nuclear device again in violation of international law, something must be done.\nCan Donald Trump convince the Chinese to partner up with us against North Korea?\nThat would end the problem and be good for world order and business.\nAgain, it is a mystery why the Chinese will not exert their strength and influence on North Korea.\nSumming up, President Trump gained a measure of respect for his actions against Syria, the U.S. military is gearing up, but caution is the word.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "As we reported last week, the president's job approval numbers are likely to go up because he took strong action against Syria after the tyrant Assad gassed his own people.\nRight off the bat Mr. Trump went up three percent in a new CBS News poll.
