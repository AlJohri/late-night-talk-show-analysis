The fact that they are allowed to run wild is disturbing in the extreme.\nAnd it's not just Barack Obama's fault. We're living in a cowardly world where villains know they can commit atrocities, violate international law and generally do whatever they want without lawful nations confronting them. The fact that Turkey is allowing ISIS to murder it's civilians on their border says it all. The Turks should be ashamed.\nAdd to that, the lack of American leadership. That is where President Obama takes a big hit. It is up to him to rally the world against evil. We are the super power. We are the nation that stands for freedom and justice. But from the very beginning, President Obama did not want that responsibility. He wanted America to be one of many nations. He wanted to see consensus about how to deal with difficult problems. Well the abdication of leadership is not working. Our world is becoming more chaotic by the day.
