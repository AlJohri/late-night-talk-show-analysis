This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nO'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us, I'm Bill O'Reilly in the \"Weekdays with Bernie\" segment tonight. Let's get right to the purveyor BernardGoldberg.com, Mr. Goldberg. So, it looks like Biden is going to run against Hillary. How do you think that will shake down in the liberal media precincts?\nBERNIE GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first, I think reporters desperately want Joe Biden to announce because they understand that journalism, like literature, thrives on confrontation. And apparently, despite the crowds he is drawing, Bernie Sanders isn't the opposition that they want. I think they are salivating over a possible food fight between Hillary and Joe Biden but then they can go in several directions. One, I think some liberal journalists are going to say that Hillary Clinton's problems are real. They are not trumped up. They are not the work of Republicans or the media and she brought it -- she brought them on herself. And if they could have another liberal that they could rout for, I think they will.\nAnother group, for them, being part of history isn't enough. Being eyewitnesses isn't enough. They want to help shape history. And they did that with Barack Obama in 2008. And certainly the feminists are going to want to do that again in 2016, since she is also historic candidate. But there is something going on that's sort of like brand new, and that is the president, apparently, has given his blessings to Joe Biden to run that's not a mutual statement. And I think journalists who are still enthralled by Barack Obama may be influenced by that, they may be influenced by that.\nO'REILLY: Well, the war on women thing though. I mean, look, I don't know how they campaign against each other because as we established there is no difference in their political philosophy. They are straight down the line doctrinaire liberal Democrats. They're never going to go against the party. They never going to offer a solution out of whatever the party has said for the last 20 years.\nGOLDBERG: That's right.\nO'REILLY: They're not going to go up against Joe Biden. Joe Biden is mini me to Barack Obama. It's the same thing. He is never going to say anything different than Barack Obama says, ever.\nGOLDBERG: Correct.\nO'REILLY: All right?\nGOLDBERG: Correct.\nO'REILLY: Now, Hillary, there is a little bit of a difference. But here's the deal. Biden likes, I mean, Obama likes Biden and I don't think he likes Hillary very much. And for him, knowing the President, the way I do, that means something. You know, if he likes you, and then he knows he can get you on the phone after and say Joe, you know, he will be the elder statesman out of the White House but still a big advisor, right?\nGOLDBERG: Absolutely. And I think Barack Obama is -- I mean, I think he is a narcissist. I think he cares about his legacy. He said recently, as is well known, that if he were allowed to run for a third term.\nO'REILLY: He would win again. Right.\nGOLDBERG: He would win again. Well, you talk about mini me, that's Joe Biden.\nO'REILLY: Yes. He will be right there with Biden and he will still be actively involved with the Clintons would cut him cold. Now, let me ask you this. Let me ask you this.\nGOLDBERG: Yes.\nO'REILLY: If Biden goes against Hillary, then does he enlist in the war on women? Does he get a uniform and go after the women? I mean, you know, anybody goes after Hillary and says great things about her, that's a war on women play here. How does Joe handle that?\nGOLDBERG: A uniform. My sources tell me that she is going to have a nice plaid skirt that is he going to go out campaigning. What do you mean a uniform?\nO'REILLY: The war.\nGOLDBERG: No. But I think what you said earlier is as crazy as it sounds. I think you have got something right. And that is -- am I still on? And that is that the two of them-I mean, Bernie Sanders and Hillary may have some differences. But you Joe Biden and Hillary don't have any differences.\nO'REILLY: Nothing.\nGOLDBERG: But that's where the media is going to have a tough time. That's where reporters are going to have to decide which bandwagon they are going to jump on. In the case of one of them, she is a woman.\nO'REILLY: Right.\nGOLDBERG: She is not getting indicted.\nO'REILLY: I think you might be wrong about that.\nGOLDBERG: That is never -- that is never going to happen. Never.\nO'REILLY: I don't know.\nGOLDBERG: That's not going to happen.\nO'REILLY: All right.\nGOLDBERG: That's not going to happen.\nO'REILLY: Last word real quick. Why don't they like Bernie Sanders? How come Bernie Sanders isn't the guy?\nGOLDBERG: Yes. I mean, that's an interesting question. I mean, he drawing big crowds --\nO'REILLY: Yes.\nGOLDBERG: And some -- I don't know.\nO'REILLY: You don't know? He is going to take their houses too along with all the Republicans? Bernie wants to take everybody's stuff.\nGOLDBERG: You know what I think it is? I think they don't take him seriously because despite the crowds, despite the poll numbers in New Hampshire, they just don't believe that the American -- that even democratic voters are really going to.\nO'REILLY: That crazy.\nGOLDBERG: A socialist as to dominate.\nO'REILLY: Right. All right. Bernie, thank you.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
