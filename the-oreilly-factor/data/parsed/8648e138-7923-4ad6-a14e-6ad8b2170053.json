The President saying the USA is guilty of some deadly judgments itself and we should not be so ready to condemn the Russian leader. That was a flashy but not really all that substantial.\nAs we explained last night, President Trump wants to make a deal with Putin that would encourage Russia to help us crush ISIS and neutralize Iran. So, he is not going to alienate Putin at this time. Now, you may remember that President Roosevelt dealt with Stalin, a killer who makes Putin look like little bo peep. FDR did that to defeat Hitler.\nAlso, the President tweeted, President Trump, \"Barack Obama made deals with Iran, even though the Mullahs are big time killers.\" So, history is full of compromises, something that was not pointed out by the media in its rush to bash Trump over Putin. To me, the most important thing the President said in that interview was that he will hold Iran accountable for aggressive actions. That is a huge difference from President Obama, who did not want to confront Iran.\nAlso, Mr. Trump will apparently punished sanctuary cities by withholding some federal funds. Like the refugee deal, that will lead to core challenges and things will get nasty. The far left will mobilize its protest apparatus that is organized now. The President will be labeled a bigot and on and on. However, I do not believe Donald Trump is going to back down. From the sanctuary city deal. The other breaking news had to do with tax cuts, the President saying they will happen this year.\nAlso, ObamaCare, which looks like it will take a little bit longer to dismantle than Mr. Trump originally thought. All in all, a lot of news came out of a 36 minute interview. As \"Talking Points\" stated listen, the President was direct and confident in his position that of course drives the Trump haters absolutely mad. And that is \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "The headline grabber was Mr. Trump talking about Putin.
