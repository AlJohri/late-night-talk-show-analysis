But less is more. In 20 minutes, we would probably be the best presentation.\nGeorge Washington's second inaugural address is less than five minutes. As the old general didn't have much to say at that point. But Mr. Trump does have a lot to say because he is in a unique position. There are powerful forces in America committed to destroying him. And the national media is a big part of that. So, \"Talking Points\" believes that tomorrow, President Trump should not only say what his vision for America is, but why he feels his policies will help the folks.\nThe only way to overcome the hatred against him is to communicate directly to the people. New FOX News poll asked, does Donald Trump listen to people like you? Forty percent say, Trump does a good job in that regard. Fifty percent say, a bad job. So, the more the new president can direct his remarks to the folks, the stronger his position will become. And on that note, I have changed my opinion. I used to think all of his tweeting hurt Donald Trump.\nBut now, it is a necessity because he can expect to be attacked every day. He must have a rapid defense mechanism in his own words and Twitter provides that. Now, as far Trump's message, it has to be economically based. How to improve the financial situation for hard-working Americans. All of his domestic policies have to revolve around that theme. He has to connect them in his address tomorrow.\nFor example, if you are going to crack down on border security, say why. Explain how that will help Americans make a better living. If you are going to knock out a bunch of environmental regulations, specifically say, how that will improve the country. It will not be enough for Donald Trump just to proclaim, he will have to explain. In the past, there have been some very interesting statements made by new presidents. Here you go.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nREAGAN: It is not my intention to do away with government. It is, rather, to make it work. Work with us, not over us. To stand by our side, not right in our back.\nGEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The enemies of liberty is in our country should make no mistake. America remains engaged in the world, by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power, that favors freedom.\nKENNEDY: Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival of and the success of liberty.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, the sad fact is, no matter what Donald Trump says tomorrow in his address, it will not be accepted by those who despise him. But again, he can overcome that opposition if he talks directly to the folks. And if he emerges as their champion through policy success.
