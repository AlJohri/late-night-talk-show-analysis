Some of which may overturn things President Obama did. But what things? Well, we have been investigating.\nAnd here is the best available evidence. Mr. Trump is likely to issue notifications that the USA will withdraw from the Transpacific Trading Partnership, that of course will rock summation countries and put the entire region on notice. Mr. Trump is also promising to cancel restrictions on the coal industry and other fossil fuel concerns. Now, for the big ones.\nDonald Trump is going to do something on the Southern border. We are not exactly sure what. James Rosen has been looking at that and he will be with us in a moment. Also, Mr. Trump will gets specific about ObamaCare and possibly suspend some government mandates by executive order. Now you may remember back in 2009, Barack Obama issued an executive order to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nEight years later, it remains open. So, executive orders are not in stone. They can be revoke, modified, expanded. Presidents are free to change their minds. One thing a new president cannot do is overturn pardons issued by a previous president. There is some word from inside the Trump organization that the new president will institute a, quote, \"shock and awe strategy\" and sign a number of far-reaching executive actions to signal that he will shake up Washington. If, and that's a big gift, that happens next week, all hell will break loose. No question about.\nSo summing up, Americans can expect a wild first week with Donald Trump as president. He will issue a number of executive orders, Democrats will not be happy with them, and the media condemnation will be intense. Take it to the bank.
