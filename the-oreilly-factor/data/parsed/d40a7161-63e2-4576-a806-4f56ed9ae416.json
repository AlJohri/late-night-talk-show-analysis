This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nO'REILLY: \"Personal Story\" segment tonight. Reaction to the domestic terror attack in Dallas.\nWith us now here in New York City Rudy Giuliani. Mayor of New York City. I wanted you tonight. I asked specifically for you because you oversaw a police department of more than 40,000 individuals.\nRUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Correct.\nO'REILLY: Under few police chiefs.\nGIULIANI: Three.\nO'REILLY: All right? You had to know that within a body of an organization that big, you're going to have some racists, they are going to be there.\nGIULIANI: And we did.\nO'REILLY: What was the policy? What policy did you and the city impose to keep the racism at a minimum?\nGIULIANI: We did everything we could to train our police officers in treating everyone fairly. Police Commissioner Schaeffer instituted a policy called courtesy, professionalism and respect. You will see on every police car in New York City. That would be a specific course they were taught in the police academy and then retaught every two years. We also worked very hard. And this hearkened back to Mayor Couch (ph), Mayor Dinkins, me and Mayor Bloomberg to make our police force a non-majority white police force which it is.\nO'REILLY: Yes. You recruited minorities. In the nation's largest city and I covered this as a local reporter. Have very few of these incidents, we had one where a guy was killed last year but not so many. This is not a lot of racial tension.\nGIULIANI: I had three.\nO'REILLY: Three in how many years.\nGIULIANI: Three in eight years. One was an absolutely horrible --\nO'REILLY: Abner Louima?\nGIULIANI: Yes. Absolutely horrible situation in which the police officer used baton and put it up back side.\nO'REILLY: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Okay. Right.\nGIULIANI: That police officer is in jail for 25 years. That case was prosecuted by the way with Loretta Lynch and investigated by Howard Schaffer, our police commissioner.\nO'REILLY: Uh-hm.\nGIULIANI: He suspended all the police officers in that precinct and he got five of them to testify. We had a second one. And that is one in which the four police officers were found not guilty by a jury, including four blacks and we had a third one in which there was a tape recording, thank goodness, of the police officer almost being killed by the suspect and therefore it was justifiable shooting. So I had a bad one, one that went to a jury and the jury found the police officers not guilty with four blacks on the jury.\nO'REILLY: Right.\nGIULIANI: And then I had one that was totally justified.\nO'REILLY: Okay.\nGIULIANI: So I know you can have --\nO'REILLY: Supervision.\nGIULIANI: Of all of these different situations you can have a different set of facts and they don't draw your conclusions until all the facts are in.\nO'REILLY: Until the facts are. And as mentioned that's why I didn't cover the Minnesota thing right away. Now, when you see something like Minnesota where it's a low level beef, the guy had a brake light out and all of a sudden he is dead, that's how people are going, how can that happen? How can --\nGIULIANI: I'm not defending Minnesota. I don't know that I can. I don't know all the facts. But it doesn't matter if it's a low level arrest or high level arrest. The minute an arrest takes place it's a violent situation if the person doesn't completely submit. Because the police officer becomes nervous about. So, the answer is if the police officer tells you to put your hands up, put your hands up.\nO'REILLY: That is the answer. But if it doesn't happen, I think restraint has to be taught.\nGIULIANI: Absolutely right. And we tried to teach them that but if you have ever been in these situations, emotions take over.\nO'RIELLY: Absolutely. That's what happened in Ferguson.\nGIULIANI: And some police officers are excellent at it.\nO'REILLY: And some aren't.\nGIULIANI: And some aren't. Most of them are excellent.\nO'REILLY: Now, we have coming up after you the head of the DC branch of the NACCP. He has been sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. My posture is Black Lives Matter is exacerbating racial tensions here and by the way they are going about protesting. They are making things worse rather than better. With Martin Luther King, you could see how he was trying to make things better. These people aren't in my opinion. Where do you come down?\nGIULIANI: Well, I agree with it completely. I mean, of course Black Lives Matter but so do blue lives, police officers. So do white lives and Asian lives and Hispanic lives and all lives matter. And if Black Lives matter were truly concerned about Black Lives they would be concerned about black crime. Because although there are some of these incidents that are indefensible by police officers. They are statistically miniscule in comparison to the enormous amount of murder that takes place black on black.\nO'REILLY: Yes. And we're seeing that in Chicago.\nGIULIANI: And Black Lives Matter is not existing when in seven blacks were killed over the weekend in Chicago. Do you know who is there trying to stop that? The police officers who get killed.\nO'REILLY: Sure. But it's even worse to that with Black Lives Matter. They are protesting right this second in front of the White House. But are they protesting the terrorists who killed the five police officers? No? There is not one side in that whole crew about, you know what? We have got to stop these haters from doing that. Nothing.\nGIULIANI: Well, I have no doubt that my policing strategies Bill Bratton, Michael Schaffer (ph), Bernie Kerik, Michael Bloomberg and Ray Kelly save more black lives than any Black Lives Matter Movement ever save.\nO'REILLY: That's because you brought down crime in the poor black neighborhood.\nGIULIANI: By the thousands.\nO'REILLY: Right.\nGIULIANI: By the thousands, Bill. I came in there were 1024 murders and I left Mike with 500 and Mike got it down to 300. Just think over those years how many black people we saved since 70 percent of the people killed in New York City are killed by blacks and by other blacks.\nO'REILLY: But the police haters say it's not because of the police. They came down for other reasons. The police didn't have anything to do with that. That's what the police haters say.\nGIULIANI: Well, the police haters are wrong. I mean, police officers Liu and Ramos who were assassinated here in New York City were protecting a black housing development where there was too much crime. And one by the way was Asian and the other was Hispanic.\nO'REILLY: Right.\nGIULIANI: And they were there trying to save black lives. And, in fact, New York City police officers over the last 20 years have saved more black lives than any police departments in the United States.\nO'REILLY: Does President Obama have a point when he brings the gun issue to fore when he makes that the central issue rather than terrorism? Does he have a point?\nGIULIANI: No. Guns don't kill. People do. And when people don't have guns they use bombs and when they don't have bombs, they used knives, and when they don't have knives they used other devices. We can see that. We had massive killings in Brussels and Paris very, very strong gun control laws. Here is a perfect comparison. New York City has very strong gun control laws. Chicago has very strong gun controlling laws. Chicago has three-and-a-half times the murders of New York. So, tell me gun control has something to do with it because -- does not.\nO'REILLY: It's how an --\nGIULIANI: Effective policing taking the guns out of the hands of the bad guys is how you stop --\nO'REILLY: Drive it down.\nGIULIANI: And second, good community relations and trying to have a representative police department and I am very proud of the fact that the New York City Police Department is a non-majority white police department and I had something to do with that but so that my from two predecessors and my successor.\nO'REILLY: Okay. Now, 30 seconds, you are trying to help the families of the killed police officers in Dallas. Tell us.\nGIULIANI: Tunnel2towers.org is an organization that raised the money to pay for the mortgages, for Officers Liu and Ramos when they were assassinated. They have opened a website. They're an organization that began with September 11th. Administrative costs are almost nothing. All the money goes to the police officers.\nO'REILLY: Uh-hm.\nGIULIANI: And if people would contact Tunnel2towers.org or call 1-844- bravest and make a donation, that money will go directly to the police officers' families. When September 11th happened, I started an organization to raise money for all my police officers and firefighters. We raised $224 million. And it all went to those families, every single penny.\nO'REILLY: All right. Tunnel2towers.org.\nGIULIANI: Perfect place to do it.\nO'REILLY: Thank you.\nGIULIANI: We'll have a press conference tomorrow. And we want to help these families.\nO'REILLY: All right. Okay, Mr. Mayor. Thanks very much. We appreciate it.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
