The President, back then, got 26 percent. But this is now.\nHillary Clinton's campaign is drifting. Donald Trump rising in the polls. Secretary Clinton's aides are talking to the FBI about the email case. And she is even being criticized by ardent liberals.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEWART: What I think about Hillary Clinton is, you know, I imagine it to be a very bright woman without the courage of her convictions. Because I'm not even sure what they are. Maybe a real person doesn't exist underneath there. I don't know.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Also, this morning, Vice President Biden said something that may annoy Mrs. Clinton.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I had planned on running. It's an awful thing to say. I think I would have been the best president. But it was the right thing, not just for my family but for me.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: \"Talking Points\" will remind everyone that if Secretary Clinton is indicted over the email fracas it is likely to be Joe Biden, not Bernie Sanders who will get the Democratic nod at the convention. Party chieftains know Senator Sanders is simply too far out there to win the presidency.\nSo, why is Hillary Clinton having so much trouble right now? First of all, Sanders has rattled her. She never expected that kind of intense challenge from a socialist.\nSecond, although the secretary is smart, she is not a natural campaigner. While Sanders has energized younger voters, Mrs. Clinton cannot even seem to win over the far left.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nKWAME ROSE, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: You have young people in this city who aren't loyal to the Clintons because their parents were locked up by the 1994 crime bill. Their parents were attacked with the war on drugs, with welfare reform. Their parents, you know, these are the victims of the Clinton administration. This is a new generation.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: But the new generation doesn't turn out in large numbers to vote. So, it doesn't really matter, does it?\nNow, in order to beat Donald Trump, Mrs. Clinton is going to have to come out of the left wing precincts and appeal to independent voters. Therefore, she will have to talk to people like me and answer responsible questions.\nTrump talks to everybody. He is on MSNBC all the time. But Hillary Clinton is very cautious granting interviews. At this point she might want to rethink that strategy. If she truly believes that she is the right person to run this country, then Hillary Clinton should talk to all Americans, not just ideological soul mates.\nFor now, the Clinton campaign is in trouble, no doubt. But a resounding victory in California could change all that -- the vote in the Golden State on June 7th.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["STEWART: What I think about Hillary Clinton is, you know, I imagine it to be a very bright woman without the courage of her convictions.
