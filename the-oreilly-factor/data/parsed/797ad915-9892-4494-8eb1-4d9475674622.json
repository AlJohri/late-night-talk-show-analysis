It's a very selfish thing. They are doing a very, very bad disservice to the country.\u201d\nNow, it is certainly true that Obamacare passed in the first place without one Republican vote.\nSo to be fair, partisan politics dominates both sides of the aisle.\nBut there's one very important difference - Obamacare was an unknown when it passed in 2010.\nNow we know it doesn't work because health insurance premiums are rising for too many Americans and a number of health insurance companies are simply bailing out of the system because they can't make enough profit.\nSo the situation must be improved for the good of all.\nHere's what should happen:\nThe federal mandate that all Americans must buy health insurance is not a good thing.\nEven though the Supreme Court said it\u2019s constitutionally okay, it really isn't. The feds have no right to tell us to buy anything.\nHowever, there are millions of Americans who simply cannot afford health insurance.\nThose folks should be able to receive government assistance, but in order to make it efficient that assistance should come from the states through Medicaid.\nAlso health insurance companies should compete nationwide. That would drive down the premiums for working families.\nIn addition, those Americans who do not buy health insurance should have to pay a bit more for coverage after they get sick.\nIt is simply not fair for someone to wait until they have cancer and then want the same insurance rate as a healthy person.\nIt's also not fair for the partisan press to say folks will lose their health insurance if those same people refuse to apply for Medicaid or whatever.\nI mean come on.\nAs Talking Points laid out last week, there is a huge conflict between the Bernie Sanders people who want free health insurance for everybody and conservatives who say you should pay your own way.\nThat's at the heart of the healthcare debate, and it's never going to be resolved.\nBut for the good of all Americans, these pinheads in Congress should try to get the best bill possible and put their ideology on the shelf.\nWorking Americans do not deserve to be gouged paying for healthcare insurance.\nAnd we are a compassionate country so we have to have safety nets for those who cannot support themselves.\nThe problem is, the can-nots mix with the will-nots and the system gets hammered. But that's another problem that will never be solved.\nThere will always be irresponsible Americans who game the system.\nTalking Points believes the Republican version of Obamacare will make it through the House with some compromises and arrive in the Senate at the end of March.\nThere are a few Democratic senators who can be won over but only a few.\nSo a new healthcare law is shaky to say the least.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "The two things are separate, thank God.\nToday the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a statement saying they have no evidence that anyone tapped the Trump Tower.\nNot a surprise.\nAlso today, the White House dragged our pal Bret Baier into it and he'll be here shortly.\nBut first, the debate over your health and how the country should treat you.\nFact number one - we need a new healthcare system because working Americans are paying too much for health insurance, and the federal government is running up debt that will eventually harm all of us.\nSo Congress needs to move.\nBut no matter what the Republican majority in Congress comes up with, the opposing party will not vote for it.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: \u201cIf we had the greatest healthcare bill ever in history, and we needed eight votes from the Democrats to get us up to the 60 number that you would need, they would not vote for it.
