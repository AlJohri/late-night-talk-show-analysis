The so-called acceptable losses theory. Today under heavy pressure, President Obama was force to do talk tough about the ISIS savages.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nOBAMA: Our mission is to destroy ISIL. Since I asked to update the American people on our campaign two months ago, we have seen that this continues to be a difficult fight but we are making significant progress.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Well, some progress is being made in the half measures being used against the savages. But not enough progress to vanquish the Jihad or even dent their murderous swagger. The President and the American left, they have a good measure of responsibility for not annihilating terror threats that are ongoing and have changed our way of life. Here are the facts. The left opposes a declaration of war against radical Islamic organizations. They oppose the Patriot Act, which gives U.S. intelligence agencies more tools to blunt attacks.\nThe left opposes tough border security measures. In fact, some in that crew even want open borders. Many on the left would not even support Kate's Law which quickly and harshly punishes violent foreigners who defy deportation. And, perhaps, the greatest hypocrisy of all. Instead of demanding strong punishment for criminals and terrorists who use guns, the left stands silent and so does Mr. Obama. All they want is to obliterate the Second Amendment, which was put into the constitution to give us the right to protect ourselves from bad people. It's the guns, not the terror threat that really move the left.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nWHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-HOST OF \"THE VIEW\": All you people on twitter that like to come after folks, back up. Back up because you can't explain this.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.\nGOLDBERG: You can't explain this away. You couldn't explain it in Sandy Hook. You can't explain it here. Keep your thoughts to yourself. I don't care what you think. Back off me. I don't care.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: The Orlando attack has mobilized Americans and quickly become a campaign and presidential legacy issue. In response to persistent criticism that he does not verbally define Islamic terrorism, Mr. Obama today said this.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nOBAMA: There's not been a moment in my seven and a half years as president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn't use the label radical Islam. Not once has an advisor of mine said man, if we really use that phrase, we're going to turn this whole thing around. Not once.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Here's what the President does not seem to understand. It is his job to lead the world against the jihadi. By not even spelling out the precise danger, by using substitute wording for Islamic terrorism, he is sending a message that it's not really the fault of the Muslim world that this atrocious jihadist campaign has taken root. It's not really their fault. But here's the truth. If all the good Muslims in the world would unite against the jihadi, it would be wiped out in weeks. Are we clear?\nNow, the right wing responsibility. There is too much gun crime in the U.S.A. And high powered weaponry is too easy to get. That's the fact. So let's deal with it. We all have the right to bear arms. But we don't have the right to buy and maintain mortars. Even if you feel threatened by gangsters or a new world order. No bazookas, no Sherman tanks, no hand grenades. That's because the Second Amendment clearly states the government has a right to regulate militias, made up of individuals. They have that right in the name of public safety.\nTherefore, Congress should debate what kind of weapons should be available for public sale. And the states, the individual states should decide what kind of carry laws are good for their own people. New laws are definitely needed in the age of terrorism and mass murder. The FBI and other federal agencies need the power to stop suspected terrorists or other evil doers from buying weapons, that law needs to be very precise. Also gun dealers all across America should be required to report the sale of certain kinds of guns heavy weapons directly to the FBI.\nNot handguns, not talking about that but other weapons that would be defined by Congress. That is a sane approach and would make it a lot tougher for the Omar Mateens of the world to get the weaponry to kill. Although as talking points has stated many, many times, no society will ever stop all gun crimes, especially in a country which has hundreds of millions of guns already in circulation.\nNow back to ISIS. According to a study by the Rand Corporation. The number of Sunni jihadist Muslims doubled between 2010 and 2013. The prime years of President Obama's pull back or retreat in Iraq in the Middle East. Just since 2014, more than 1,000 human beings have been murdered by ISIS outside of their base areas in Syria and Iraq. While President Obama is content with wearing ISIS down and outsourcing the direct fight to others, that strategy is clearly leading to more death and disruptions all over the planet. But the left will not see that this is a war worth fighting.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEPHEN COLBERT, CBS ANCHOR: After 9/11, we went to war in Iraq. Treated as a military.\nO'REILLY: That was a mistake.\nCOLBERT: Why is this not a mistake?\nO'REILLY: Because we wouldn't be an occupier here. We wouldn't be an occupier here. This is a war of attrition against that terror group that's the same philosophies as the Nazis. It's the third Reich, it's insane.\nCOLBERT: How did that stop like a lone gunman here in the United States?\nO'REILLY: It doesn't. I told you, you can't stop that.\nCOLBERT: You can't stop it. So, why would we then declare war based on this?\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nO'REILLY: Because then rather than outsourcing the fight against ISIS to the Kurds, NATO would do it. And NATO would then destroy command and control of ISIS. All right? And al Qaeda. Destroy it. So there would be -- right now, guys like Mateen think ISIS is winning because they are on the internet and ISIS is telling them they are winning and ISIS is causing all kinds of trouble. Once the world sees that these people are being annihilated and I mean annihilated, right? That whole propaganda we are winning the jihadi, the caliphate, we are going to get this established vanishes.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nO'REILLY: By the way we posted the entire interview with Colbert on BillO'Reilly.com. Just in time to prove my point, a new FOX News poll asks Americans if the U.S.A. is a stronger or weaker country under President Obama's leadership? The poll among registered voters is instructive. Forty nine percent say, the U.S.A. is weaker since Mr. Obama took office. Forty percent stronger. Summing up, the Islamic jihad has declared war on America and the West. We have not, have not respond to do their violence with any kind of urgency.\nWe are reactive rather than aggressive. At home, we need tighter regulation of individual weapons of mass destruction. But we also need to stop demonizing good people who own guns for protection and want to keep their rights in place. Clear? Hope so.
