Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nO'REILLY: Thanks for staying with us, I'm Bill O'Reilly in the \"Weekdays with Bernie\" segment tonight. As we mentioned in the Talking Points Memo, Hillary Clinton has not done a single national interview since September 12. And this week, Donald Trump is avoiding the national TV press as well.\nJoining us from Miami, the purveyor of BernardGoldberg.com, Mr. Goldberg. Let's take Hillary Clinton first. Do you agree that she is being a bit imperious? Word of the day, imperious. Do you think she is?\nBERNIE GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I do think she is. And you also said in your Talking Points that she is in hiding. And I think you are right on that too. But, if I were giving her advice and not a likely possibility. But if I were giving her advice, I would tell her not to do interviews with you or anybody who is serious about this. You said you wanted straight -- answers to straight questions.\nO'REILLY: Yes.\nGOLDBERG: Bill, she can't give straight answers because she is too vulnerable. She just can't do it.\nO'REILLY: Well, you are convicting her though. You are convicting her of what the FBI is investigating her for. So --\nGOLDBERG: Tell me what is in it for her? What is in it for her to --\nO'REILLY: Well, I will tell you, I'm giving her the presumption of innocence, because that's the kind of guy I am. All right?\nGOLDBERG: But when --\nO'REILLY: Go ahead.\nGOLDBERG: But when she -- when you ask a legitimate question, and she dances around it, Bill, I know you, you are not going to sit there like a potted plant.\nO'REILLY: Of course I'm going to come in and level the boom but why doesn't she explain it.\nGOLDBERG: Because she can't explain it. I know it. I suspect you know you are being a little too kind right now.\nO'REILLY: Well, no, wait, wait, wait.\nGOLDBERG: And I know your audience knows it.\nO'REILLY: If she, the Secretary of State, okay, and she has been, I didn't do anything wrong in the Clinton Foundation, I didn't take any money for influence. I didn't do anything in the email. It was a foolish personal mistake that I made, sorry I did it. So, if that's true. If those denials are true, she had no problem going in and explaining whatever question I asked.\nGOLDBERG: And what if it's not true?\nO'REILLY: Well then she should resign and not try to be president of the United States. Why do we want a person who has committed a felony to be leading this country?\nGOLDBERG: Bill, never lose that charming innocence, it's beautiful.\n(LAUGHTER)\nGOLDBERG: It's beautiful.\nO'REILLY: You asked for an answer. You know, I mean, if the woman knows she is a felon and then she is still trying to bamboozle the country, it's not going to be impeachment. She is going to be in solitary confinement for 30 years.\nGOLDBERG: Everything isn't a crime. Look, let's think -- one question that isn't on the daily news and it's a legitimate question. I think you'll agree. What if you say, you know, you said, Mrs. Clinton, that when you left office in 2,000, when your husband left office, you were dead broke. Those were your words, not mine. You were dead broke. Now you and your husband are worth over $100 million. How did that happen in 15 years?\nO'REILLY: That's a good question. Absolutely. And she will say, well, we were lucky and fortunate to have people pay us to speak and we made good investments and blah blah blah blah blah, you know.\nGOLDBERG: And you would never take that and you know it.\nO'REILLY: Well, I might be skeptical in my follow-up questioning.\n(CROSSTALK)\nRight. But, I gave her advice to level with the folks. She rejected my advice. Now, Trump, Trump, you couldn't get him off TV and now for the last week, he didn't want to be on TV anymore. What's going on there?\nGOLDBERG: You know, I think that makes sense too, I mean, in a political sense. If he -- if he does an interview, except if it's an incredibly friendly interview, then the journalist controls the agenda. But if he goes to a rally where everybody loves him, he does the rally, he picks the subject, nobody is questioning him, it winds up on the local news at 6:00 that night in North Carolina or Ohio or whatever, and he gets his point out with no interrogation.\nO'REILLY: I know, I know. He reaches so many more people when he does shows like this which reach millions and millions.\nGOLDBERG: But he is not going to win any more votes than he has already won by being on this network.\nO'REILLY: I'm not so sure about that.\nGOLDBERG: Or national television not enough.\nO'REILLY: Because the focus now -- people who weren't paying attention now the World Series is over. They are kind of locked in. So, I'm not sure that's right. Bernie, always great to talk with you. Thank you.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
