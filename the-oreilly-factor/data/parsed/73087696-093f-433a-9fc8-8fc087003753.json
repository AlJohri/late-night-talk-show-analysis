The vote in South Carolina will be on Saturday, February 20th. And already attack ads are on the air between Trump and Cruz.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What kind of man talks from both sides of his mouth on amnesty for illegals on national television and still denies it? Who took more than a million dollars in sweetheart loans from Wall Street banks and fails to disclose it as required by law?\nTed Cruz, the worst kind of Washington insider who just can't be trusted.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, I got the Trump action figure.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No way. It's huge.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What does he do?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He pretends to be a Republican.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You took my house Mr. Trump.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's a lousy house. I'm going to take your house with eminent domain and park my limos there.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eminent domain.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: So you can see the South Carolina race will be intense as both Trump and Cruz vie for conservative votes and the three more moderate Republicans desperately try to emerge.\nNow, on the Democrat side, Bernie Sanders must get black votes in order to compete with Hillary Clinton in South Carolina and Nevada. He started his campaign for those votes last night.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSANDERS: When we talk about transforming America, it means ending the disgrace of this country having more people in jail than any other country in the world disproportionately African-American and Latino.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Well, Sanders says he is a straight talker but not, not on this issue. Here's the truth. African-Americans make up 13 percent of the total population in the U.S.A. but commit 37 percent of all murders. And 90 percent of black murder victims are killed by other blacks. You will never ever hear either Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton say that.\nRepublican candidates will not likely point it out either because it's politically incorrect. It's much easier to cry racism than actually address the root causes of violent crime which are a corrosive culture and the collapse of the traditional family.\nOne foot note, some of the candidates made a big deal out of the heroin problem in New Hampshire but, of course, failed to mention that President Obama and other politicians now consider selling heroin on the street -- that's a deadly drug, remember, to be a nonviolent crime; not worth very much punishment. Thus, the risk/reward ratio of dealing hard drugs rises.\nAgain, most politicians will never tell you the truth about social problems, preferring to pander.\nTrump and Sanders, the victors last night largely won because they are seen as mavericks, outsiders who will dismantle a corrupt and inept political system. That is the perception. We will see what kind of reality both bring going forward.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What kind of man talks from both sides of his mouth on amnesty for illegals on national television and still denies it?
