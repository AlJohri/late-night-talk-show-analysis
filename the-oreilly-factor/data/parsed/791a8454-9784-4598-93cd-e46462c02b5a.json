This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nO'REILLY: You are looking at the Democratic gathering in Philadelphia where an all-star lineup will speak this evening including President Obama. Tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will give her keynote address and then it's onto the campaign full throttle. Donald Trump's running mate Governor Mike Pence of Indiana will be center stage during the campaign, of course. I have never met with the Governor but spoke with him a short time ago.\nSo, Governor, thanks for doing the interview. First time for you on The Factor. I want to get your view of the world.\nGOV. MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You bet.\nO'REILLY: Now, I got a look at President Obama's speech this evening in advance. Is he going to basically portray the United States as being not in decline and a vibrant, positive place on the rise? That's opposite to what the Republican platform is saying. How do you see America? How do you see America today?\nPENCE: Well, I think I see America the way most the American people see us and that is after seven-and-a-half years of the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, we have seen America's role in the world decline and we have seen an economy stifled by the high taxes, government and ObamaCare proceeding out of this administration. So, I think it's run of the reasons why Donald Trump's message is resonating so much but with so many people all across this country. Because people know we have got to come back. We have got to be bold and we've got to see America strong and home and abroad again.\nO'REILLY: Let's go to the economy. Indiana did very well. Came back from the recession well. What did you do in Indiana that President Obama didn't do nationally?\nPENCE: Well in Indiana we just put common sense conservative principles into practices.\nO'REILLY: Well, tell me what they're. Tell me what they are.\nPENCE: Well, live within your means, and let people keep more of what you earn. You make the right investments in education, infrastructure, even healthcare and then you take three steps back and you let people prosper.\nO'REILLY: What about you? What about you, Governor? I read an article in the \"New York Times\" right after you were nominated that said you're a religious fanatic, you don't like gays because you were behind that law that that doesn't force bakers and people like that to do gay weddings, that you're against the woman's right to choose, all of that. First of all, what exactly are your religious beliefs?\nPENCE: Well, you know, I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican. In that order, Bill.\nO'REILLY: What kind of a Christian though? Are you an evangelical Christian? A traditional Christian?\nPENCE: Well, you bet. You know, I made a personal decision I committed my life to Christ when I was 18. I was raised in a wonderful Catholic family. My wife and I worship at a mainstream evangelical church in Indianapolis quietly every Sunday with lots of neighbors and friends. But you know, I may consider myself just a pretty ordinary Christian, try to spend a little bit of time in prayer and a little time in the book every day and do my level best to live it out in my own personal life.\nO'REILLY: Now gay marriage is law of the land because of the Supreme Court. Does that offend you?\nPENCE: Well, look, I will always believe in marriage is between one man and one woman. But, but my conviction on this matter is that is an issue that ought to be left up to the states. That once again we saw the Supreme Court of the United States reach in to what has been the purview of state laws for generations and impose their view of that on all 50 states.\nO'REILLY: They did that.\nPENCE: Just the way they did with Roe versus Wade.\nO'REILLY: They did that for equal protection reasons. They've seen to believe those -- the Supreme Court who voted for gay marriage that if you deprive homosexuals of that, that you are biased against them. You don't believe that?\nPENCE: Well, I don't. Look, I abhor discrimination against anyone. You know, one of the heroes of my youth was Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I think people know me well and know my family know that we treat everyone with the same love and respect that we would hope to be treated by others.\nO'REILLY: What about abortion? Would you support a revocation of Roe v. Wade?\nPENCE: I hope to live to see the day that we restore the sanctity of life back to the center of American law. I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it and I truly do believe that Roe vs. Wade was wrongly decided and, again, overturned more than a century of pro-life laws that had been enacted through the Democratic process in all 50 states. But we are making great progress. More young people today embrace the sanctity of life than ever before the great work of Crisis Pregnancy Centers across my state and across this nation is changing hearts and minds every day.\nO'REILLY: Yes. The left says that you are anti-women, if you don't believe in quote-unquote, \"reproductive rights\" that you are biased against women. It's the same argument about gay and gay marriage. When you hear those arguments, those politically correct arguments that are made in the media, almost every single day, when you hear those that you, because you oppose gay marriage, because you want Roe v. Wade to be revoked that you are a bigot. How do you respond?\nPENCE: Well, I just try, you know, I try to lead a roll off my back. It just comes with the territory, Bill, you know that. But people that know me and look at my administration in the state of Indiana. We have had women in senior leaderships and our cabinet positions. Women in senior leadership positions in our executive branch. We celebrate the accomplishments of women all across the state of Indiana. And really the policies of Donald Trump and I will be advancing. I think are going to improve the security and the prosperity of women and men --\nO'REILLY: Okay.\nPENCE: All across this country and so we will let the left do their -- the way they like to divide things up and segment, the population. We will going to promote policies that will benefit all Americans.\nO'REILLY: Governor, we really appreciate you taking the time. We know how busy you are. We hope we can continue the conversation throughout the campaign. Thanks, again.\nPENCE: Count on it, Bill. Thank you.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.
