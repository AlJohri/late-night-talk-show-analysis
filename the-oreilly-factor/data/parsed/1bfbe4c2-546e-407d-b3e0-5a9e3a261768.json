ORANGE COAST COLLEGE PROFESSOR: \u201cA white supremacist and a vice president that is one of the most anti-gay humans in this country. \u00a0And so we are in for a difficult time. \u00a0And then again I do think we can get past that. \u00a0Our nation is divided. \u00a0We have been assaulted. \u00a0It\u2019s an act of terrorism. \u00a0One of the most frightening things for me, and most people in my life, is that the people who are leading the assault are among us. \u00a0It is not some stranger from other country attacking our sense of what it means to be an American.\u201d\nThat was said in a classroom at the Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California.\nOf course it is simply gibberish slander, intellectually absurd.\nYet the college pays that instructor to \u201cassault,\u201d using her word, her students.\nI mean, come on. \u00a0Who wants to hear that kind of diatribe in a psychology class?\nSo the question then becomes what should be done to stop the madness?\nIt's a tough one because many college professors have tenure, which means they can't be fired no matter what they do. \u00a0And there is the freedom of speech issue.\nBut there comes a point when the nation has to know exactly what is happening in its institutions of higher learning.\nIf you know your history, every totalitarian regime controlled the schools.\nIn 1930s Germany, in the Soviet Union, in China after Mao took over, it was propaganda across the board in the classroom.\nAnd if the teachers didn't toe the line, they were fired or worse.\nNow we have the totalitarian left in America and if you don't see it their way, you are attacked and demonized.\nAnd if you're a student, you can be punished through the grading system.\nThis cannot continue.\nIt is up to each individual state to monitor what happens in their public colleges and high schools.\nEven in private school, if the institution gets taxpayer money, the state has a right to know what is going on.\nIt is time for governors to hold college administrators responsible for crazy stuff going on in the classrooms.\nAcademic freedom is one thing. \u00a0Harming students with insane ideology is something else.\nAnd
