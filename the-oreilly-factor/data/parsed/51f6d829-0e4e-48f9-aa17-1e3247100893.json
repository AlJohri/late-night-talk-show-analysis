It's now been more than eight years since greedy banks and mortgage companies ignited one of the worst recessions in the nation's history. Eight years is more than enough time though for the powers that be in Washington to get the country back on the fast track economically. But it hasn't happened. No matter what kind of propaganda you hear.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nPRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: By almost every economic measure, America is better off than when I came here --\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nAt the beginning of my presidency. That's the truth.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Not exactly. Here are the facts. Median income for American families up less than one percent on the President's watch. Nearly 14 million Americans have stopped looking for work since Mr. Obama took office. An increase of more than 15 percent since his inauguration. And the gross domestic product, which measures the health of the American economy has risen less than three percent every year since 2009.\nIf that holds true, this year, and it will, Mr. Obama will go down in history as the first modern president to not produce a GDP of more than three percent in any year of his administration. So that's the fact, Jack. And no amount of spin will change it. Americans understand it's much tougher to prosper these days than it should be.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nHILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I want to be sure that we get small businesses starting and growing in America again. We have stalled out. I was very surprise to do see that when I began to dig into it. It turns out that we are not producing as many small businesses as we used to, and a recent world study said that we are 46th in the world in the difficulty to start a small business.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: That's all true. Everything Mrs. Clinton is true. And the reason? High taxes on business and expensive regulations. Yet, Secretary Clinton continues to say she will carry on the policies of Barack Obama, which have mandated high taxes and an avalanche of regulation. Very puzzling. To be fair, the President now says he wants to cut the corporate tax rate but it's a little late, is it not? So Donald Trump has the economic field pretty much all to himself. All the polls say American voters are not happy with the Democratic Party's economic programs.\nBut Trump must do more than just promise. He has to get very specific. The truth is, China may not be intimidated into a better trade deal with the U.S.A. Mexico certainly is not going to pay for a billion-dollar wall, which they believe is insulting. And while bringing jobs back to America is achievable, it will require a big carrot as well as a thick stick. Nothing is ever easy in the economic precincts. But that is where Donald Trump will either live or die as a presidential candidate.\nSocial issues, matter little this year. Terrorism is important. But the situation is so complicated voters cannot possibly predict outcomes on the terror front. However, the folks know, they know what's in their bank accounts. They know President Obama has not helped them out very much. Advantage? Trump. And that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["PRES.
