"'The O'Reilly Factor': Bill O'Reilly's Talking Points 12/5", "date": "2016-12-06T13:30:14Z", "full_transcript": "One of the reasons Donald Trump won the presidency is that millions of Americans now believe they are being conned on immigration.\nHillary Clinton and the Democratic Party had absolutely no interest in being responsible on the issue of people traveling to the USA illegally or even protecting Americans from vicious foreign criminals already here.\nIn fact, the far-left wing of that party actually wants open borders and blanket amnesty for the undocumented living all across the country.\nNever mind that would create a dangerous security nightmare and run up far more government debt.\nLiberal zealotry sees America as a nation driven by white privilege and wants to flood the USA with new citizens, the fewer restraints the better.\nAnd it doesn't matter that Hillary Clinton might not be that extreme.\nShe put forth no vision on immigration other than the status quo, which has been a colossal failure.\nThus, Trump's tough guy approach to enforcing immigration law propelled his campaign despite the unending charges of racism that came his way\nSo now the question becomes, what is a fair policy in this most emotional of arenas?\nFor that we turn to Australia, a nation of about 24-million people but with a land mass almost exactly the same as America's.\nAnd we have 325 million people.\nSo there is plenty of room to roam Down Under.\nAustralia has a stone-cold policy on illegal entry. \u00a0If you are caught, you are forcibly taken by the Aussie military to remote locations in the South Pacific, where you can either sit for years or be deported home.\nAustralia accepts less than 15,000 migrants a year on a humanitarian basis.\nRecently it announced it would take 12,000 Syrian refugees on top of that.\nBut even more recently the Obama administration said it would take more than 2,000 refugees currently languishing in the South Pacific, human beings that Australia refuses to bring to its mainland.\nMy question is, why not?\nWhy won't the Aussies take them?\nSurely, desperately poor people in South Asia, or Central America for that matter, deserve sympathy.\nDuring my time in El Salvador, I visited folks who were actually living in caves. \u00a0Dogs in America have more comforts.\nJudeo-Christian philosophy compels its followers to embrace the poor, and it seems that rejecting asylum-seekers and migrants goes against that tenet.\nThus, the far-left demonizes those who call for restrictions on illegal immigration, saying they are bad people.\nThat's what the Sanctuary City movement is all about.\nBut you don't hear much condemnation of Australia and inside that country both political parties support the tough immigration laws.\nThere is little moral debate.\nBy the way, if Perth for example declared itself a Sanctuary City, it would have big trouble with the Aussie military, which as I stated actually enforces immigration law.\nAnd a general reports directly to the government in Canberra.\nAustralians generally believe that undocumented migrants destabilize the country and put themselves at grave physical risk by crossing oceans to get Down Under.\nAlso, Aussie politics have created a generous welfare state that works for a small population.\nThat entitlement culture would be overwhelmed and go broke if mass illegal immigration was accepted as it has been here in the USA.\nSimply put, Australians do not want the enormous disruption that immigration chaos causes.\nSo they are sending more than 2,000 poor souls here, folks they should assimilate. \u00a0And Barack Obama is happy to take them.\nAre we chumps?\nOr are we the most compassionate nation on Earth?\nPresident Trump will have his hands full trying to figure out how to get things under control on the immigration front.\nHere is what Talking Points recommends.\nA moratorium on refugees for one year until Trump's new Homeland Security Department can reorganize and setup intense vetting procedures.\nRight now the federal government cannot properly investigate refugees who want to come here. \u00a0The system is broken.\nAll undocumented people already here must register with the feds at their local post offices within six months.\nIt becomes a felony if they fail to do that and immediate deportation if they are caught.\nBy the way, we told you very early on in the presidential campaign that mass deportations would not take place if Donald Trump were elected president.\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan confirmed that yesterday:\nPAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: \u201cWe\u2019re not working on a deportation force. \u00a0Here\u2019s what we\u2019re working on with respect to immigration, securing our border, enforcing our current laws. \u00a0He talked about criminal aliens. \u00a0That\u2019s just enforcing laws for people who came here illegally, who came and committed violent crimes. \u00a0We should enforce those laws.\u201d\nOnce the federal government knows how many undocumented people are here and their circumstance, a fair system of evaluating migrants can take place.\nOn the borders, all of those caught trying to enter illegally will be bussed back into Mexico or Canada after being fingerprinted.\nSecond offense -- six months in jail then another bus ride.\nA congressional mandate on how many foreign nationals should be allowed into America each year should be agreed upon.\nThat number should be generous, but legal papers have to be renewed each year and actual citizenship will have to be earned over a substantial period of time.\nA new law that suspends all federal transportation money to individual states that tolerate sanctuary cities must be passed.\nTexas is in the process of outlawing sanctuary cities, punishing them financially.\nEvery state should do that.\nAnd if California says no, finance your own infrastructure. \u00a0Same with all other defiant states.\nFinally, build effective barriers along the southern border using the Army Corps of Engineers.\nThe barriers designed to stop the flow of people and drugs.\nEnough is enough.\nIf I could, I'd help every poor and abused person in the world.\nBut I can't.\nSo I do what I can without making things worse by supporting policies that hurt the country at large.\nAustralia has figured this out.\nWe can, too.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "One of the reasons Donald Trump won the presidency is that millions of Americans now believe they are being
