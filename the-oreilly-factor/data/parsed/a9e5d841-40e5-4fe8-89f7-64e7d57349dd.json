It would be bad if Donald Trump is a GOP presidential nominee.\nThe liberal media despises Mr. Trump because he openly mocks their values or lack thereof. And the Republicans, some of them, don't believe Trump can defeat Hillary Clinton.\nSo let's take a look at that question. The latest poll out of New Hampshire done by a Democratic crew says Trump leads in the Granite State with 29 percent, Rubio 15, Christie 11, Kasich 11, Cruz 10, Jeb Bush 10. Talking Points believes Donald Trump will win the New Hampshire primary on February 9.\nIn Iowa Ted Cruz may win but Trump will be competitive. South Carolina, Trump far ahead in the polls. And then here comes Super Tuesday which is impossible to call right now.\nThe big thing holding Trump back is his unfavorable rating.\nAccording to a CNN poll 57 percent of American adults, not necessarily voters, adults do not like Mr. Trump. That includes 27 percent of Republican folks. Despite that, Trump continues to dominate the national GOP polling.\nThe reason for that is that many Americans are fed up with what has happened to America. They're tired of standard politicians lying to them and they believe Trump will blow up the entire system.\nBut there is more. In a \"Wall Street Journal\" column today Daniel Hennenger puts forth that political correctness has alienated so many Americans that the anti-PC guy Trump is acceptable no matter what he says. Mr. Hennenger points to phrases like gender neutral, diverse, inclusive, multiculturalism, racism, sexism and on and on.\nI don't know about you, but I'm fed up with that garbage because it's used to hurt people. The politically correct crowd often fires vile accusations toward those they don't like.\nFolks who oppose gay marriage, for example are homophobic. People who want a responsible welfare system are anti-poor. Americans no believe that the enormous out-of-wedlock African-American birth rate is hurting the country are anti-black.\nThat's vile stuff and clear thinking people Americans know it. Thus, when a guy like Trump actually attacks politically correct madness, he gains devoted followers. The truth is that Donald Trump could win the Republican nomination but he will still have to moderate his tone a bit and he will have to get more specific in his problem-solving vision.\nBut I believe he has got a chance. And if he does win, it will be the most incredible political upset in history.
