Now, the stamina of both Mrs. Clinton and Donald Trump is amazing. These people are under constant pressure in motion all the time. And the fact that they can pull that off is astounding.

You name it. And, unfortunately, there are people like that.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: A few people. But not 50 percent of Trump supporters. That's lunacy. That smears millions and millions of Americans. Didn't take long for Mr. Trump to strike back.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nDONALD TRUMP, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run. She spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes, and scratch out a living for their family. Our support comes from every part of America and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions of working class families who just want a better future.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Talking Points believes that Secretary Clinton made a big mistake here. Reminiscent of Mitt Romney saying that 47 percent of Americans would not vote for him because they want stuff. Every fair- minded person knows you cannot generalize about what is in people's hearts. And I do not include the far left under the banner of fair-minded.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSTEPHANIE CUTTER, 2012 OBAMA DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER: He is attracting a certain type of voter, she gave a whole speech on describing them. They are called the alt-right. So, what she said was not wrong. Her only mistake was that she described half of the supporters that way.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: That woman apparently believing that all who support Donald Trump are racist and inferior human beings. That opinion echoed on the op- ed page of the \"New York Times\" today by another far left loon. What Mrs. Clinton's comments really do what they really do is mobilize those who were thinking about voting for Donald Trump. Not his hard core supporters. Those who are not quite sure. I mean, come on, branding people racist is despicable. Everybody knows that unless there is undeniable proof of that charge.\nAgain, fair-minded people understand. And I heard Hillary Clinton say the \"basket of deplorables\" line, I was surprised. She is usually a measured speaker. And that line was written for her. It was on a prompter. Somebody should have known it would give Donald Trump a major advantage. But, again, campaigns are very strange things.
