Mr. Cheney says he would not change a thing. He'd do it all over again. And most folks seem to agree with that assessment.\nA new Pew poll asks were the C.I.A.'s interrogation methods justified in the period following the September 11th terrorist attacks? 51 percent say justified; 29 percent not justified. 20 percent don't know. Do you believe harsh interrogation methods prevented another terrorist attack? 56 percent say yes; 28 percent, no. So the folks seem to be siding with Mr. Cheney.\nAccording to the controversial senate intelligence report, at least 26 detainees were abused or wrongfully held by the C.I.A. The agency says only three were waterboarded, the report implies more were. The report also says the C.I.A. misled Congress and President Bush but specifics on that are lacking. Methods of interrogation included sleep depravation, ice baths, force feeding, shackling, and slapping. At least two detainees died while in C.I.A. custody.\nNow, some Americans are outraged saying the interrogations were a gross overreaction to the al Qaeda attack. Many of those folks also object to drone warfare aimed at jihadists and using ground troops to attack them. In addition, they oppose the Guantanamo Bay prison facility as well as other terrorist detention centers worldwide.\nSo my question is a simple one because I am a simple man. How exactly would you defeat the terrorists who have declared war on America? How?\nIn Sydney, Australia today, Muslim fanatic apparently kills two, injures four others before police shoot him dead -- another lone wolf terror attack that we're seeing all over the world. So far, all the wolves have been Muslims. So again, if you're not going to use drones, tough interrogations, ground troops, or detention centers, how are you going to stop the madness? The answer is you're not going to stop the madness. The jihadists are going to continue to attack, and you are going to have to absorb the punishment they distribute.\nVice President Cheney was talking about life and death. In the days and months after 9/11, America was desperately trying to learn about the enemy that attacked us and stop any further assaults on American soil. So, some harsh measures were used, I believe justifiably. Although mistakes were made in the fog of war, always happens. U.S.A. did not overreact by roughing up some jihadists. We did overreact by invading Iraq.\nThe solution to the tortured debate is to stop the witch hunt right now and pass a law that says only the President of the United States has the power to order harsh interrogations. He, or she, must sign off on them. That way, one central authority can dictate the methods used in extreme circumstances. That law should be passed as soon as possible so the madness can stop. We need robust intelligence agencies to protect us and if you don't understand that, you are a fool.\nAlso it's important to understand that some who object to confronting the terrorists do so because they believe America brought the terror war on its own. The far left is very consistent. It's always America's fault. Therefore, anything that weakens the U.S.A.'s power is good. These people drive much of the debate about torture.\nThe C.I.A. controversy is similar to the anti-police movement seeing. That was ignited by the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Over the weekend there were a few well-planned demonstrations implying that American police and prosecutors do not value the lives of black citizens.\nIn New York City, a college professor was arrested for attacking police. There is the attack. Two NYPD officers were injured in the melee. The man, Eric Linsker, teaches at the city College of New York and Baruch and he has been charged with assault on a police officer and inciting a riot among other things. Do you think the colleges will dismiss him if he's found guilty? Don't bet on it. Some college officials despise the police, as do some on the street.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do we want?\nCROWD: Dead cops.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: When do we want it?\nCROWD: Now.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do we want?\nCROWD: Dead cops.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: When do we want it?\nCROWD: Now.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fight back.

Sing it out.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Mr. Jackson is entitled to his opinion. And it would be interesting to see if he can defend it.\nBut a far more serious question is does New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio distrust his own police department? Some police officials are accusing de Blasio of that and there's even a petition whereby police officers are demanding that the mayor not attend their funerals should they be killed on the job.\nJesse Watters will have more on this intense situation later on.\nSome of the anti-police demonstrators continue to shout \"hands up, don't shoot\", even though 15 out of the 20 eyewitnesses testifying before the grand jury in Missouri apparently did not see Michael Brown with his hands up in a surrender position -- 15 out of 20.\nNevertheless some protesters continue to put forth that scenario. They do so because they don't like the police. And they want to see the justice system torn down.\nLast week, Russell Simmons said on this program that blacks selling hard drugs like heroin, cocaine, and meth were not committing violent crimes and should not be incarcerated. Of course, that opinion would lead to anarchy in the streets and the virtual destruction of poor neighborhoods.\nThe anti-police coalition is an interesting mix.

Their numbers aren't large, but they can cause big trouble in the name of justice which is the last thing these people really want.\nLike the C.I.A., American law enforcement is there to protect the folks. And generally speaking, they do a damn good job while putting their lives on the line. The police certainly make mistakes, but they do not deserve the demonization they're receiving from these protesters and some politicians.\n\"Talking Points\" believes a backlash is coming and the folks who want to destroy America's defense apparatus will soon be marginalized.
