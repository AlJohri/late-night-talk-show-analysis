Mr. Trump delivered a major address, accusing Hillary Clinton of corruption and incompetence.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and guys put to death. Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary filed disclose while at the State Department? Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Mr. Trump reading from a teleprompter scorched the former secretary of state for wanting to admit to Syrian and Iraqi refugees, some of whom he believes are jihadists, thus the reference to enslaved women and guys.

They were desperate. They needed help. Hillary Clinton State Department refused them all. She started the war that put them in Libya, denied him the security he asked for. Then left him there to die.
