Blocking a major intersection. Making the distaste for Trump loud and clear with one particular unbroadcastable anti-Trump slogan repeated again and again among other shouts and chants.\n(CHANTING)\nBut what had been a protest in the First Amendment tradition morphed into something much darker. Police donning riot gear, protesters becoming more threatening. A bottle was thrown at police lions, rocks hurled. A patrolled car's rear window smashed the vehicle then stomped. The crowds had stopped traffic on several streets. Among the vehicles trapped, one driven by a Trump supporter who got out of his car and then emerged from the crowd with a bloody face. The police ordered the crowd to disperse. They didn't.\nMany of them seemingly more intent on taking selfies than taking part in political protests. Arrests began to be made. And eventually the police and sheriff's deputies began pushing back the crowd. In all, there were more than a dozen arrests as the police appeared to focus on containment, rather than confrontation. But what was, perhaps, most remarkable here was that this all happened at a presidential campaign rally. A measure of the passions of this extraordinary political season. But a sign, too of how easily those passions can and might damage rather than dignify democracy.\nIn Costa Mesa, California, Jonathan Hunt, FOX News.\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nAll right. Thanks to Mr. Hunt for that excellent report. Now, the continuing anti-Trump shenanigans actually helped the candidate. When Americans see people destroying police cars and generally behaving in untoward way, they don't like those people. Their actions are undemocratic. And actually provide sympathy for the person they dislike in this case Donald Trump. Many of these protesters are so stupid, they can't understand that. But it's the truth. Once a movement is considered harmful by the folks, once that is established, anyone opposed to that movement gets a positive shine.\nBest example, Richard Nixon versus George McGovern in 1972. The violent demonstrations against Nixon actually propelled him to a landslide victory even though the man himself was not generally liked.
