Both Clinton and Trump would enter the White House under dark clouds. They would be the most unpopular president elects in history.

Piling on is now an American sport.\nAnd like the NFL games, the news media has set up programs with so-called experts, sit around for hours, offering gross speculation about things they could not possibly know anything about. An American day, all accusations are convictions. Therefore, both Trump and Clinton, who have extremely controversial resumes will be battered without mercy right up to Election Day. WikiLeaks apparently has thousands of e-mails left to drop on Clinton, spent a torrent of personal accusations against Trump.\nThe result -- a diminished country. We the people do not deserve this. But there is little that we can do about it. Clinton and Trump won the nominations, that is our system. Both have dubious histories, but voters did not seem to care. People ask me all the time, where are the inspirational leaders? Like the Roosevelts and Ronald Reagan, the answer to that question is that most decent people don't want to be any part. They don't want any part of the internet gutter snipes and a press that celebrates scandal, condoning contrive or even dishonest attacks.\nThus, many good leaders simply sit it out. By the way, there are no journalistic standards anymore as the WikiLeaks hackers have demonstrated. The cold truth is, our political system has devolved into a chaotic surface where candidates with the most money usually win. Summing up, with no privacy anymore, with little restraint in the media, with millions of Americans more interested in texting in social media than actually experiencing life. We have now come to a point in history that we get near a solace.\nThe next president of the United States will either be Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.
