The headline is both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump expose themselves politically last night. American voters who are paying attention now know exactly where the candidates stand. The back and forth on abortion is the best example.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: If you go with what Hillary is saying in the 9th month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, can you say that that's okay? And Hillary can say that that's okay. But it's not okay with me.\nCLINTON: I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So, you can regulate, if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, it's somewhat shocking and I mean that shocking that Hillary Clinton would support late term partial birth abortion citing the health of the mother. As we saw in Kansas and in Pennsylvania, the health of the mother could be anything. There are corrupt doctors who will abort for money on the most flimsy of physical excuses. In a humane country, the unborn must be protected to some extent by the government. Otherwise, we don't have any moral authority on anything. Next up, illegal immigration.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nWALLACE: Is that your dream, open borders?\nCLINTON: Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy, you know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Chris Wallace citing the WikiLeaks hack showing Secretary Clinton saying to a bunch of Brazilian bankers, quote, \"My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders. Sometime in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it,\" unquote. So, this isn't just about energy, Mrs. Secretary. It's about what the EU does. Mrs. Clinton supports people moving freely in this hemisphere as they do right now in Western Europe. That is the truth. Now, we did we devolve and get into the how the candidates really feel about each other.\nTRUMP: Look, Putin, from everything I see has no respect for this person.\nCLINTON: Well, that's because he would rather have a puppet as president of the United States --\nTRUMP: No puppet, no puppet. You're the puppet.\nCLINTON: It's pretty clear you won't admit.\nTRUMP: No, you're the puppet.\nCLINTON: That the Russians.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, puppets all over the world are outraged and they have a right to be. Then, things got even worse. Here's Clinton on Trump.\nCLINTON: It's not one thing. This is pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. That is not who America is.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: It's clear Hillary Clinton despises Donald Trump and vice versa.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: She shouldn't be allowed to run. It's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run. And just in that respect, I say it's rigged. Because she should never -- Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency, based on what she did with emails and so many other things.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Finally, Donald Trump made a tactical mistake by continuing to suggest the election may be rigged. That may play well with Trump's base, but he needs to win over independents and people who are skeptical of him.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nWALLACE: I want to ask you here in this stage tonight, do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely, sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?\nTRUMP: I will look at it at the time.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, that statement dominated news headlines today. Wiping out all the political points last night. Giving the media yet another hammer to pound Trump into pudding. Talking points does not understand why Donald Trump does not understand that stuff like that hurts him. He clarified today in Ohio.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: Of course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Well, that's what he should have said last night and that would have knocked it out of page one. Summing up, nobody won the debate. So Hillary Clinton will likely maintain her substantial lead. And that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": ["TRUMP: If you go with what Hillary is saying in the 9th month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.
