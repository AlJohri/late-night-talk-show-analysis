vision.\nHe promised to stop American corporations from sending blue-collar jobs overseas:\nDonald Trump in Delaware, Ohio, Oct. 20:\nTRUMP: \u201cCompanies like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico. \u00a0Ford is moving all of their small car production to Mexico. \u00a0When I\u2019m president, if a company wants to fire their workers and leave for Mexico or other countries then we will charge them a 35% tax when they wanna ship their products back into the United States, and they won\u2019t leave, believe me.\u201d\nNow the Carrier Corporation says it will stay in Indianapolis, saving a thousand jobs.\nThere is no question that President-elect Trump, using Vice President-elect Mike Pence, put the arm on Carrier.\nA president can do a lot of damage if he or she chooses to.\nCarrier wised up fast and the folks know Trump is the reason:\nROBIN MAYNARD, CARRIER EMPLOYEE: \u201cI would like to tell him thank you for going out of your way and taking your holiday away from your family and working on the Carrier and employees deal and sticking to your word and going to bat for all of us at Carrier.\u201d\nNow if Mr. Trump continues to fulfill promises, he will gain much needed support in Congress.\nRight now, no Republican would dare defy Trump after a victory like Carrier.\nIn the long run, there are two things that Donald Trump needs to do to achieve a successful presidency.\nThe first is to foster an environment where good-paying jobs are created.\nThe second is to stop the chaotic enforcement of immigration law.\nIt is quite clear to Talking Points that the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton put the needs of immigrants, some of them here illegally, above the needs of working folks.\nFor the past eight years, President Obama has encouraged illegal alien amnesty for certain groups, sanctuary cities and a colossal welfare state.\nMeanwhile, the folks out in Indiana and other places were being laid off because corporations wanted to make a few extra bucks by moving to Mexico.\nTrump said, \u201cEnough.\u201d \u00a0Thus, he won the election.\nSumming up, Trump is off to a good start with the Carrier deal.\nHe might adopt a new motto with a nod to Teddy Roosevelt: Tweet softly, but carry a big stick.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "As we've stated, Mr. Trump won the presidency
