In fact, protests led directly to the freedoms we have today.\nThe civil rights marches led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. a pacifist were also very effective in mobilizing public opinion against Jim Crowe laws and bias in general. Dr. King got a lot of accomplishments before he was assassinated. Now, we have another protest situation in the U.S.A. whereby many African-Americans believe that law enforcement works actively against them.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nGINGRICH: If you are a normal white American, the truth is you don't understand being black in America and you instinctively underestimate the level of discrimination and the level of additional risk.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Mr. Gingrich is essentially correct. Skin color is a very personal situation. Every one of my black friends has felt diminished at times because of their complexions, it's wrong. There is no excuse for it, but it happens in every country. Enter American law enforcement which is now under siege for allegedly treating Black Americans more harshly than White Americans. Talking Points does not believe, does not believe there is a designed campaign of prejudice. What is happening here is cause and effect.\nBecause Black Americans commit far more crimes proportionately than whites or other ethnic groups, they come into contact with police more often. In that context sometimes turns volatile. However the key stat in the U.S.A. is, that less than two percent of all police civilian interactions result in any kind of physical confrontation. That's extremely low. The issue of incarceration, again, deals with crime. The inner city drug traffic and the violence that comes along with that has put American police agencies and law abiding citizens in a dangerous place.\nIt's no surprise that Black and Hispanic drug traffickers are arrested and incarcerated. No surprise. Their numbers are greater proportionally than white drug traffickers. Now, back to the protests. The key group driving violence on the streets is Black Lives Matter. After five police officers were killed in Dallas, a Black Lives Matter organizer Sir Maejor has said this according to the Associated Press.\nQuote, \"Black Lives Matter doesn't condone shooting law enforcement, but I have to be honest, I understand why it was done. I don't encourage it. I don't condone it. I don't justify it. But I understand.\" Now, that's a provocative statement in the extreme. Understanding terrorism? Which is what happened in Dallas -- terrorism. It's not difficult. You get an evil human being who kills people. A five-year-old can understand that. Maejor says he doesn't condone it, so what's the point of understanding it?\nAgain, a ridiculous, irresponsible statement. But we have come to expect that kind of thing from Black Lives Matter which chanted about police here in New York City, pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon. Unfortunately President Obama does not seem to understand the vitriol.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nPRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: In a movement like Black Lives Matter, there is always going to be some folks who say things that that are stupid or imprudent or overgeneralized or are harsh. And I don't think that you can hold well-meaning activists who are doing the right thing and peacefully protesting responsible for everything that is uttered at a protest.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: With all due respect to President Obama, well-meaning activists do not associate themselves with a group that often commits violent acts and encourages violence through irresponsible rhetoric. Dr. King would not participate in a Black Lives Matter protest. Of course, a liberal American media, largely sympathetic to the street demonstrations, even if they do turn violent. How many more times are we going to have to see Black Lives Matter protesters destroy stuff? How many more times? If you criticize the group you are branded a bigot by some far left media precincts. Do you know that shortly after the Dallas police were murdered, a cop in Missouri was shot and critically wounded by a Black man?\nThe Saint Louis County police chief says, it was an assassination attempt. The accused shooter 31-year-old Antonio Taylor has a long rap sheet, he is a thug. In Minnesota another police officer hit in the head by a concrete brick thrown by a protester on Saturday night. You guessed it, the demonstration was organized by Black Lives Matter. So, again, Mr. President, you might want to back away from protesters who believe violence is acceptable. Summing up, you want to protest? Good.\nMake sure you have your facts straight, and don't hurt anybody or destroy any thing.
