With all due respect to Martin O'Malley he has no chance so I will focus on Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\nTruthfully Senator Sanders has no chance either because he is a socialist and America will never vote for a socialist as commander-in-chief. Be that as it may, Senator Sanders is competing well against Hillary Clinton in the small states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\nNationally he is 25 points down. Still, not a bad showing for uber left guy.\nNow, the media loves to mock Donald Trump for dubious things he says. But Sanders makes Trump look like Abraham Lincoln.\nHere is what Mr. Bernie wants to do. Destroy Wall Street and the big banks. Provide each American with free healthcare -- kind of. He would highly tax affluent Americans to pay for the government-run healthcare industry. Private health insurance would be outlawed.\nAlso, Bernie wants free tuition at public colleges and university. Also free child care for millions of Americans. Also mandatory family leave whereby companies would be force to pay for both men and women to take time off after babies are born.\nThe list of Sanders' freebies is endless. The unintended consequences are simple -- a bankrupt nation. The nearly $20 trillion debt would double under a Sanders administration. Also, many American corporations would simply leave the country and go overseas. That would devastate the economy.\nDoes Bernie Sanders not understand any of this? It is simply insane, insane to tell the folks that you will destroy the capitalistic infrastructure.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSANDERS: You have got to break up these huge financial institutions. They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy.\nIt turns out that they were crooks and they destroyed our economy.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Again, if Bernie Sanders were ever elected president, the economy would collapse. Companies would flee abroad. The U.S.A. would turn into Venezuela. That's why Bernie Sanders will not be president.\nHe is, however, very entertaining, is he not? Especially when he unloads on his opponent -- Hillary Clinton.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSANDERS: The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Secretary Clinton -- and you are not the only one -- so I don't mean to just point the finger at you. You have received almost $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: I think she is the only one. I don't know anybody else who has gotten $600,000 from Goldman Sachs.\nNow, if Bernie, again, were president, Mrs. Clinton would have to pay the feds most of those Goldman Sachs fees in taxes.\nLet's take a look at Hillary Clinton's point of view. Like Senator Sanders, she wants the government to pay for, quote, \"debt free\" college education, child care, family leave, free medical insurance for those who have none. Also, she wants equal pay for women mandated in the private marketplace. And with all of that, she believes she can unite Americans.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nCLINTON: I would be working in every way that I knew to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean-spiritedness. There is a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform. But we need to do it together.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Wow, that sound bite sounds like the song \"Happy Together\" by the Turtles -- one of my favorites. And it's just as realistic. Apparently Mrs. Clinton doesn't understand that more than half the population doesn't trust her according to recent polls. How could she possibly bring folks together to drastically change the nation the way she wants to?\nIn the debate last night Secretary Clinton did not say how she would improve the economy nor did Senator Sanders. The Democrat platform is to provide. How that would stimulate the private marketplace -- one of the great mysteries of the universe.\nThe most surprising thing Hillary Clinton did last night was inject racism into the debate.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nCLINTON: One out of three African-American men may well end up going to prison. That's the statistic. I want people here to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men and very often the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated for offenses that do not lead to the same results for white men.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Mrs. Clinton's one-in-three statistic is false, according to the Justice Department. The secretary obviously going for the black vote with her inaccurate statement because Bernie Sanders is not attracting much interest in the African-American precincts.\nOn the subject of ISIS, both Clinton and Sanders were amazingly vague.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nCLINTON: I have a three-point plan that does not include American ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we are doing, supporting fighters on the ground --\nSANDERS: Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: So, somehow magically, Bernie Sanders is going to convince Muslim nations to launch a ground war against ISIS. Gee, I wonder why no one else has ever thought of that. I'm sure that the so-called Muslim nations are lining up to fight on the ground.\nSorry for the cynicism but Talking Points has pretty much had it with political BS on both sides.\nBoth Clinton and Sanders well know The Obama administration has allowed ISIS to grow in power. Neither one of them has any realistic solution to stop that. And this is the headline in the debate last night.\nMuch of what the candidates said is simply unrealistic. Apparently Bernie Sanders doesn't understand there is a congress that makes laws in America. His crazy left vision of government running the economy and everything else would never pass. Most of his proposals wouldn't even get to a vote.\nHillary Clinton made it clear she is running as Barack Obama's second, pretty much saying he has been a successful president, and she would carry on his programs.\nOne more point. Do you really believe that if Sanders or Clinton are elected president they can unilaterally destroy banks, insurance companies, and drug companies? Do you really believe that? If Bernie Sanders starts to punish American drug companies, research and development of new drugs stops cold. And those companies as mentioned go overseas. You can sell aspirin from anywhere.\nHillary Clinton is not as extreme as Sanders but she is a big fan of Obamacare. However, 52 percent of Americans are not big fans, according to a recent CBS News poll.\nSo all in all, if the Republicans cannot beat the Democratic Party in 2016, when will they ever beat it? But you know what? The GOP is so confused, the leadership so divided, that Hillary Clinton could win. She could win.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["SANDERS: You have got to break up these huge financial institutions.
