This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nO'REILLY: \"Impact Segment\" tonight, the Clinton Foundation is run by Bill and Hillary Clinton along with their daughter Chelsea. Over the past few years, it has received millions of dollars from Arab countries that suppress women.\nMr. Clinton was asked about that over the weekend.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The UAE gave us money. Do we agree with everything they do? No, but they are helping us fight ISIS. My theory about all this is disclose everything and then let people make their judgments.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: And the controversy comes on the heels of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail brouhaha -- word of the day. Joining us now from Washington, Democratic strategist Jennice Fuentes; here in New York co-host of \"The Five\", Dana Perino. Now, if you were spokesperson for Hillary Clinton -- and I want to remind you that Miss Dana was spokesperson for President Bush the younger -- how would you fend this stuff off?\nDANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, first of all, you have to get your facts straight. That's the absolute most important thing is to know all the facts and understand them well.\nO'REILLY: But what if Mrs. Clinton wouldn't tell you all the facts.\nPERINO: Well then -- then you couldn't do your job. And at that point -- it's not that you have to agree with them. But you have to have all the facts so that you can know. One of the things that's happened to the State Department and the White House over the past two weeks is they have tried to answer questions about these stories and then they've been proven wrong within about 48 hours because new facts come out. That's why I'm saying the fact pattern that we've been looking --\nO'REILLY: But you, Dana Perino could not demand of a president or presidential contender, tell me the facts, you have to trust that when they give you stuff that that's it. You can't go where is it? You can't do that.\nPERINO: Well, if you want to double-check it with somebody, then I learned this actually from Marlon Fitzwater who was press secretary to Reagan and George Bush 41. You ask the secretary of defense the same question that you ask the national security advisor in separate rooms. If they give you the same answer you are good to go to the podium. If they don't there is a problem.\nO'REILLY: All right. Now Jennice, how would you defend Hillary Clinton?\nJENNICE FUENTES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I would say it's a little brouhaha, to use your word. Why is this a story? This is a story because being very transparent and all of that information is on the foundation's Web site. They did not have to disclose and be as transparent as they are. In fact they don't even take anonymous donations which it's allowed.\nO'REILLY: All right. The donation story -- I don't think that's going to be the big thing here.\nI think it's going to be the e-mail story. The donation story is people can -- as the President said, you can make up your own mind whether you are hypocrites or not by taking the money. Ok.\nBut the e-mail story now that becomes problematic if it's a drip, drip, drip stuff. More will come out.\nFUENTES: Of it could be -- it could hurt her and it could hurt any candidate if this becomes, as you say, a bigger story. Is it going to be a bigger story? Are there missing e-mails that are so important to national security? We know she didn't get hacked. It would have made the news already. We know that the e-mails she is dying to release them so let's wait and see the facts.\nBut let me tell you something --\nO'REILLY: Ok. I think it's fair to wait and see but there is already a gap brought out by Congressman Gowdy who is going to be on Megyn's show after this about the day that she traveled to Libya. There is no e-mails that came out on that and that's inconceivable she wouldn't have any.\nFUENTES: Let's make a bet for those candidates, those voters that could be persuadable. I guarantee you that those who can be persuaded are not going to make their judgment on Hillary Clinton based on the e-mail fiasco. They will not --\nO'REILLY: I think it will have an effect.\nLook, Jennice is right, this is emotional candidacy. Hillary Clinton is a known commodity. People who like her are going to like her whether she turns over the e-mails or not. But it is the 20 percent in the middle that are going to make the call on who the next president is. And I think the e-mail thing is going to resonate if there is more stuff here.\nPERINO: It's going to resonate because, look, if there was a good answer to the e-mail question, they would have answered it last week. We are now the tenth day into this story.\nToday the CNN reports that Hillary Clinton will answer questions about this within the next 48 hours. To me, that says that they are still trying to figure out not only how to answer the first question but it's the second and third questions that they might not be able to answer. And then you are talking possible real problems, maybe even illegal issues surrounding these e-mails. To me that's fairly black and white.\nAnd that gets down to the trust factor. People might like her very much but when it comes down to trusting her, that 20 percent that might be persuadable just might --\nO'REILLY: It's also what else kicks in Jennice is you get exhausted. The Clintons will wear you out. That I think is going to be a factor. Last word?\nFUENTES: I don't think it's a fatigue factor when the coverage is so aggressive, in fact I think that is true what you said. She elicits very high emotions on both ends. Let's wait to see what happens. And give her a break for crying out loud. Let her come out to the facts.\nO'REILLY: Ok. But the facts have to be verified. That's the problem. I would rather see Mrs. Clinton not give the press conference. And testify under oath in front of the congressional committee. That's what I would like to see.\nLadies, thank you.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
