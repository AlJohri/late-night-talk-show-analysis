Just think about that. And that's what happened to Kate Steinle on July 1st of this year.\nShe was walking with her father, enjoying a summer evening, when an illegal alien criminal took her life. 45-year-old Juan Sanchez, Mexican national, has been charged with Kate's murder being held on $5 million bail.\nHe was also being held by the county of San Francisco before the murder. But the sheriff ok'd his released despite the fact that Sanchez had seven felonies on his sheet and had been deported five times. San Francisco authorities knew this and let him go even after ICE asked for a hold on the man. Why? Because San Francisco is a sanctuary city and officials there don't give a damn and not a damn about harm caused by alien criminals.\nThe Steinles are not a political family. They are not looking for vengeance but they are absolutely fed up.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nB. STEINLE: It's been two months since Kate's death. The city of San Francisco and the sheriff's department have done absolutely nothing to protect this from happening to another person.\nWe feel as though we have exhausted avenues. We're frustrated. And we are here to make sure that a change is made so nobody has to endure the pain that my mom and dad and I go through on a daily basis because the system failed our sister.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Now, as you may know, The Factor has proposed a new law that would provide mandatory five-year federal prison terms for any aggravated felon who defies deportation. That is known as Kate's Law. There are a number of versions of the law being debated in Congress. We strongly suggest that the words \"aggravated felons\" be included in the law because if those words are not, the Democrats and President Obama will oppose Kate's Law. They will hide behind what I call the chambermaid theory. That mean people just want to punish poor illegal aliens.\nWe all know that's a lie. The federal government has failed to protect Americans from foreign criminals who prey upon us. The sanctuary system is a disgrace. President Obama has failed to do his duty. He is sworn to uphold the law of the land. He does not uphold immigration law. So it is time for Congress to pass Kate's Law to send a very powerful message.\nThe Steinle's coming lawsuit claims general negligence and a failure to uphold the law. In just a few moments our \"Is It Legal\" team will analyze the odds of that lawsuit being successful. But just the message, just the message is worthy. San Francisco and the people who run it must be held accountable for Kate's death.\nThey knew Sanchez was a repeat felon. They knew he was deported and came back time after time after time. And they let him out of jail anyway. That's outrageous and should never happen again in this country. San Francisco must pay a price.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": ["B.
