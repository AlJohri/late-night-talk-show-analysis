That's because many on the left do not want to punish people, especially the poor, who commit crimes. They see those folks as victims of an oppressive society, i.e., America.\nSo the U.S.A. is now on the verge of becoming South Africa. As you may have heard, paralympic runner Oscar Pistorius is expected to be freed from prison this week after serving only 10 months for shooting and killing his girlfriend. In a bizarre trial Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide after he testified that he shot Reva Steenkamp in the bathroom of their home because he thought she was a burglar. Absurd and everybody watching the trial knows it.\nThe couple had been arguing. She was trying to break up with him and wound up death. Quite simply South Africa should be ashamed.\nHere in the U.S.A. media is largely ignoring the rising stats on violent crime. In New York City run by liberal mayor Bill de Blasio, murder are more than 9 percent in one year. Rape up nearly 7 percent.\nIn Chicago, run by liberal mayor Rahm Emanuel, murder is up an astounding 22 percent. Shooting incidents up more than 18 percent. Criminal sexual assault up more than 6 percent in the Windy City.\nIn Los Angeles, where the city council is unbelievably left wing aggravated assault up more than 26 percent year to year. Total violent crime up more than 20 percent. That means thousands of innocent people are dying or being injured because of foolish public policy.\nHere in New York, authorities now let vagrants openly bother passersby, use the streets as bathroom and generally do whatever they want to do. Traffic chokes the city. Commuters can't even get into work sometime. And the quality of life decline is stark and frightening and everybody knows it.\nSome of the chaos is coming from the top as President Obama's openly declared so-called nonviolent offenders should be given leniency by the criminal justice system. Included in that nonviolent category -- people who sell heroin, cocaine, crack, meth, folks who sell poison to kids. Estimates are more than 70 percent of all the crime in this country is drug-related as is child abuse and neglect. Yet, the pushers are nonviolent.\nOn the border, things are even more intense. According to a Texas Department of Public Safety report, in five and a half years, criminal aliens in Texas have been responsible for more than 600,000 individual crimes. That includes almost 3,000 homicides in Texas alone.\nSo you can see what's happening. In places where the left runs the show, Americans are now being put in danger by lenient criminal justice policies. There is no doubt about it.\nWhen a society is fine with giving a man who kills his girlfriend 10 months in prison, you don't have a criminal justice system. When a society feels sorry for a heroin dealer, you have chaos. When a society refuses to incarcerate illegal aliens with aggravated felonies on their sheet, you have anarchy.\n\"Talking Points\" believes that if Americans continue to elect far left individuals, the danger to every single one of us will soon reach critical mass.\nAnd that's \u201cThe Memo\u201d.", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "It is horrifying to watch as the violent crime rate is skyrocketing in some places run by liberal politicians.
