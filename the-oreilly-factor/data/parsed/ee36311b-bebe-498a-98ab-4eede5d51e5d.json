This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nBOLLING: Thanks for staying with us, I'm Eric Bolling in for Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us this special addition of The Factor, Election 2016. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal seems to be testing out a new strategy to get noticed in the pack of 17 republican presidential contenders. He is punching up.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nGOV. BOBBY JINDAL (R-LA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump is shallow. He has no understanding of policy. He is full of bluster. He has no substance. Folks, Donald Trump is not a serious person. This is a carnival act. And seeing that Donald Trump said that the Bible was his favorite book. Yet, when asked he couldn't even name a specific or a single Bible verse that was important to him that had an impact on him. Well, do you know why? Well, it's clear Donald Trump has never read the Bible. The reason we know he has never read the Bible, he is not in the Bible. Donald Trump is a narcissist, and he is an ego maniac.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBOLLING: Governor Jindal joins us now from Washington, D.C. So, Governor, this going after Trump, new strategy. What is it all about?\nJINDAL: Eric, thank you for having me. Look, the idea of America is slipping away from us. Eighteen trillion dollar of debt. Planned Parenthood selling baby parts across the country, our president who is about to allow Iran to become a nuclear power even while he doesn't stand by Israel. The Left is running the country into the ground. We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to get our country back. To apply conservative principles.\nBOLLING: Yes. But let's stay on the topic here. Okay, you clearly are going after Donald Trump. Is this to help pull your poll numbers up? I mean, you are struggling in the polls right now.\nJINDAL: Not at all. It's not about me. And the reason it's important to do this now, we as conservative have a choice to make. Do we apply our conservative principles or do we turn to a man who believes in nothing but himself. Eric, Donald Trump is not a liberal, he's not a conservative, he is not a democrat, he is not a republican, he is not a moderate. Donald Trump has no substance. He doesn't want to make America great again, he wants to make Donald Trump great. I love the idea of Donald Trump. I love this show. I love the politically incorrect language. I love going after the DC establishment. I love the outsider. I even think he's entertaining. I love the helicopter rides at the State Fair giving out Lindsey Graham's cellphone number, it was all great fun. But when you actually look at the reality of Donald Trump, there is a lot of foolishness there and lot of nonsense there.\nBOLLING: You know, and you have said Donald Trump needs to stay classy but then you have also said things like he looks like he has a squirrel sitting on his head.\nJINDAL: Well, that's right. I was asked about his attack on Carly Fiorina for going after her appearance. I said, he has no room of criticizing anybody's appearances given how his hair looks. But here is the bigger point. He is not against big government. He is just against big government that he doesn't control. He has been for socialized medicine, he's been for tax increases. Look, he changed his position constantly. He would implode in a general election. But even worse, if he were actually to get elected, we have no idea what he would do in office, Eric. The reality is, he doesn't believe in anything but Donald Trump.\nWe need to elect a tested, true conservative. Now is the time to shrink the government economy. Now is the time to defund Planned Parenthood. Now is the time to stand by Israel. Now is the time to grow the American economy. We have a chance to apply our conservative principles. It's been fun. It's time to put him in the elevator. It's time to tell him he is fired. Tell them to go downstairs and give him a reality show. He is great fun, great ratings. Very entertaining. His diagnosis of the problem is right but the prescription is wrong.\nBOLLING: He has been listening and I know for a fact he listens to this program. He listens when I host this program. Because he yells at me sometimes. But listen, here is how he tweeted in response to your latest round of bullies back at him. He said, \"Oh wow, light weight Governor Bobby Jindal who's registered at less than one percent in the poll just mocked my hair so original.\" Final thought, Governor?\nJINDAL: Eric, so I give him a speech and call him a narcissist and egomaniacs and he has no substance. And his take away, is he worried about his hair? He proves my point. He is a narcissistic clown. America must do better. Let's elect a conservative. Let's rescue the idea of America before it's too late.\nBOLLING: All right. Governor, thank you very much. Governor Jindal isn't the only candidate who got into it with Trump this week. Carly Fiorina was on the receiving end when the Donald told \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, quote, \"Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that? The face of our next.\" Trump defended his comments saying, he wasn't talking about her looks.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTRUMP: She mentioned something about me. She knocks me. And when somebody knocks me like Jeb Bush or anybody else. I at least decide that I think it's appropriate to fight back. But we're talking only about her persona. But, some comments are made as an entertainer. And as everybody said, as an entertainer is a much different ballgame.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBOLLING: Joining us now on the phone from Arizona, Carly Fiorina. Now Carley, do you accept Mr. Trump's explanation specifically that he wasn't talking about your face when he said face, he was talking about your persona?\nCARLEY FIORINA (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (on the phone): No. But I do accept his comments that he was speaking as an entertainer. And you know when I was in third grade, Eric, there was a little boy that really liked me. And he said mean things about me and you know pulled my pigtails all the time. And my husband and I have been together for over 30 years. But I think I know when someone is flirting with me.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBOLLING: All right. I think we are breaking some news here. Donald is flirting with you through the \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. Let's talk a little bit about the upcoming debate. CNN announced this week that you will be one of the candidates in their prime time debate along with Donald Trump. That's going to be your approach dealing with him on that stage?\nFIORINA: Oh, you know, there are many fine candidates on that stage. My first objective, honestly, is to introduce myself to the American people. You know, half that audience doesn't know my name and doesn't know I'm running for president. And so I know it seems hard to believe, particularly maybe if you are a celebrity like Donald Trump, everybody knows who you are. But I still have the lowest name I.D. in the field by a wide margin. And so I need to introduce myself. People who may not know me.\nBOLLING: Will you use this back and forth that you have got with Trump. Basically you have a lot of buzz going right now. Will you use that and step it up in the debate?\nFIORINA: You know, my principle objective is to make sure that people know who I am. And what I have done. I have a track record of leadership, of problem solving, of challenging the status quo. I'm not an entertainer. I'm someone who started as a secretary. Became a chief executive and the only way you do that is to go from secretary to CEO is to deliver results, to solve problems, and to lead. And so people need to do that I'm sure there will be opportunities for me to respond to Donald Trump or to others. And I won't shy away from those opportunities.\nBOLLING: But fundamentally, I'm running for president because I think our nation needs the kind of leadership I will bring to the oval office. No doubt but I will tell you though the other nine candidates on that stage that aren't Donald Trump would love to be in your shoes where there is a lot of buzz about you and Donald Trump's feud. If nothing else it brings the attention Governor Jindal did it and he is on The Factor and obviously it works.\nFIORINA: Yes. Well, it's also true, Eric, that this isn't entertainment. This is serious. This is serious. Our nation is at a pivotal point. And Americans know it in their bones. So, it's very entertaining for us all to talk all about Donald Trump. And by the way, the media seems to talk about nothing else but Donald Trump in many cases but voters never ask me about him. Never. What voters ask me about is how do we get the economy growing? Why is America's leadership waning in the world? How do we cut this government down to size? Voters know this is a pivotal point. And so I think most people are tuning in because they actually want to know what candidates are going to do.\nBOLLING: Right. Carley, does it surprise you that he is doing as well as he is with the women voters? I have about 15 seconds.\nFIORINA: No, not necessarily. I think if you look at all of the outsiders together, the outsiders are polling over 60 percent of support.\nBOLLING: Yes. Okay.\nFIORINA: But I will tell you something else, there is one outsider moving up in the polls and gaining on Donald Trump and I am one of them.\nBOLLING: Carly, thank you.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.
