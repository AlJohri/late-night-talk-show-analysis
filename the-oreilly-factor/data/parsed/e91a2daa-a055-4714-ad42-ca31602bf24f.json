This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!\nO'REILLY: \"Unresolved Problem Segment\" tonight: Planned Parenthood. The organization has been under fire for telling minors how to avoid statutory rape, for promoting questionable abortions, for taking public funding when it advocates a strong pro-choice position. A group called the Center for Medical Progress, a pro-life concern, has been investigating Planned Parenthood for three years. About a year ago they performed an undercover sting on Dr. Deborah Nucatola, the senior director of medical services at Planned Parenthood.\nDuring the secretly taped conversation, Dr. Nucatola talked about selling the body parts of aborted babies.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nDR. DEBORAH NUCATOLA, PLANNED PARENTHOOD: I would say a lot of other people want liver. And for that reason, most providers will do this case under ultrasound guidance, so they'll know where they're putting their forceps. We've been very good at getting heart, lung, liver because we know that so I'm not going to crush that part. I'm going to basically crush below, I'm going to crush above and I'm going to see if I can get it all intact.\nAt the national office we have a litigation and law department which just really doesn't want us to be the middle people for the issue right now. But I will tell you that behind closed doors these conversations are happening with the affiliates.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'REILLY: Wow. Joining us now from Los Angeles, David Daleiden, leader of the undercover investigation. First of all, what was the premise of talking to the doctor, Mr. Daleiden? What were you trying to accomplish there? What did you tell her about why you wanted to speak with her?\nDAVID DALEIDEN, CENTER FOR MEDICAL PROGRESS: Sure. So, our investigators, and thanks for having me on the show, Bill. Our investigators from CMP were posing as representatives of a middle man biotech company that was wanting to partner with Planned Parenthood clinics in order to purchase the body parts of the babies that they abort. And in doing that we were modeling ourselves after real life middleman biotech companies -- multiple ones that are partnered with Planned Parenthood clinics across the country.\nO'REILLY: All right. So biotech companies need body parts for research -- all right. And the body parts in question were exclusively going to be taken from babies or fetuses depending on your point of view, which were aborted but they would have had to have been aborted late term because the body parts aren't formed until the third trimester. Isn't that correct?\nDALEIDEN: Well, actually most of the body parts are there in the first trimester. But the reason that the requests come in for late second trimester body parts is partly for practical considerations that it's a lot easier to identify the body parts when the baby is bigger.\nO'REILLY: Yes, that's what I'm getting at. It's not of use to a bio firm unless they are defined and the body parts can be used. Now, the doctor didn't say she would sell or Planned Parenthood would sell body parts, did she?\nDALEIDEN: That's not entirely correct. If you look at the full footage of the entire conversation, she actually describes the current biotech company that the Planned Parenthood Clinic she works on in Los Angeles is partnered with a company called Novagenics Laboratories (ph). And Planned Parenthood Los Angeles routinely and for many years actually has been supplying their aborted fetal parts to that company.\nO'REILLY: Is that legal to do?\nDALEIDEN: It is legal to donate human organs under current law. It is not legal to sell human body parts whether they are adult or fetal any age. But Planned Parenthood has been involved in selling the body parts of the babies that they abort for decades now at this point.\nO'REILLY: Are you saying they are doing something illegal?\nDALEIDEN: Absolutely.\nO'REILLY: Have you reported this to the authorities?\nDALEIDEN: Bringing our information in front of law enforcement was always a goal that CMP had from the beginning of this project. And as we can see in the news out of Texas and Louisiana just recently in the past 24 hours, the entire state governments of both of those states are taking this very seriously and have opened up their own investigations into Planned Parenthood's sale of baby parts as have two congressional committees now.\nO'REILLY: Is that because of your information to Texas and Louisiana?\nDALEIDEN: My understanding is that it's a direct result of the video that we posted yesterday.\nO'REILLY: Ok. So you firmly believe that for years, and these are your words, Planned Parenthood has been violating the law and selling body parts to companies. Is that what you firmly believe?\nDALEIDEN: Absolutely. We spent three years with our actors and investigators undercover deeply embedded with Planned Parenthood affiliates and top level executives. We have heard from their own mouths many, many times over that they sell the body parts and that they make money off of doing so and they have the profit motive in doing so.\nO'REILLY: Is there a federal law against it or just state law?\nDALEIDEN: There is both federal and state laws against the trafficking of aborted fetal body parts. It's a big story. It's a huge story?\nO'REILLY: This could destroy Planned Parenthood if true and if there are indictments coming from the Justice Department, which is always dicey but certainly the FBI should be involved. And you say the states of Louisiana and Texas are now opening their investigations, correct?\nDALEIDEN: Exactly.\nO'REILLY: Any other action being taken? Any civil action? Anything like that?\nDALEIDEN: Not that I'm aware of. Like I said, there are two state governments currently that have announced that they are investigating Planned Parenthood for sale of aborted fetal tissue and two congressional committees have now also announced today that they're taking the allegations very seriously and opening up their own investigation.\nO'REILLY: All right Mr. Daleiden, keep us posted.
