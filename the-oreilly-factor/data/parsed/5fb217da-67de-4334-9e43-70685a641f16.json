Thanks for watching us tonight. We are looking at a live picture of President Trump, supposed to be on about half an hour ago. He's not on. So, I am here. Okay? When he comes, we'll go there.\nBut first, we will do the \"Talking Points,\" okay? Everybody in agreement? Weaponizing tax returns. That is the subject of this evening's \"Talking Points\" memo. The Trump tax return reveal, courtesy of NBC News last night. Fascinating look at how the American media has now become a circus of ideology and cynicism. Let's look at the facts.\nSomeone gave far left reporter David Cay Johnston two pages of Donald Trump's IRS returns from 2005. Old Dave said, it simply arrived in his mailbox. What a lucky guy. Johnston then gave the documents to MSNBC, and return, for putting him on the air to spout all kinds of gibberish on challenge. That was the deal. The return shows that Mr. Trump rendered to Caesar what was legally required.\nHe paid about $30 million in federal income tax 12 years ago. But Johnston was indignant anyway. And by the way, Mr. Johnston is a quasi-socialists and also said that President Trump himself might have leaked the return to him. Of course, offering absolutely no evidence to support that contention. Now I don't know about you but I have a little trouble picturing the President asking his staff, \"hey, does anyone know where David Cay Johnston lives?\"\nNow, before the actual return wasn't shown to the audience, the cable news host, Rachel Maddow, delivered a 20 minute monologue. \"Talking Points\" is only going to be three minutes. She said 20 minutes worth of stuff, describing various anti-Trump conspiracy theories that she espouses on a nightly basis. It's kind of a hobby. It was kind of hard to follow Miss Maddow, as she hopped from Azerbaijan to Cyprus to Palm Beach to the U.S. Attorney's office in New York City.\nThere was a Russian oligarch, bad people from Deutsche Bank, and a shadowy international transactional deal. Now, I kept waiting for Donald Trump to appear on the grassy knoll. But that did not happen. Perhaps, because they had to go to a commercial break. Then, the real fun started for two full hours, is a variety of anti-Trump merrymakers put forth more speculation than a panel at a UFO Convention, portraying the President as - - evil bent on destroying western civilization as he pet his cat.\nLost in the \"Let's get Trump\" marathon, was the actual leak which is a felony. If it came from the government. My guess is the illuminati did it. But I will check with David Cay Johnston. No doubt, MSNBC will derive ratings from this madness, which has had ever since they turned into this Syfy channel over there. But it's not all about ratings. Those folks want to destroy Donald Trump. Anyway they can.\nThat is the mission. And they are just getting started.
