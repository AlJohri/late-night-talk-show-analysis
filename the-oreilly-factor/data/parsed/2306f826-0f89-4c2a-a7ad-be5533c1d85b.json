\u00a0Because the liberal politicians in Chicago are making it impossible for street cops to do their jobs.\nIn fact, the ACLU is now running street crime in the Windy City.\nMayor Emanuel has instituted an ACLU-suggested policy that mandates a two-page police report each time a cop stops someone for questioning.\nThat means the cops are spending hours filling out paperwork if they even ask anyone what they're doing on a street corner at four a.m.\nHow insane is that?\nAnd then there is the racist angle.\nMost of those shot in Chicago are poor black people.\nIf the mass murder were happening in Chicago's business district, believe me, it would be stopped cold.\nSo Mayor Emanuel and Governor Rauner can be accused of racism because they allow the madness to continue.\nIn San Francisco, it's property crime.\nSince 2010, crimes like arson, car theft, and larceny are up a whopping 64%.\nWhy? \u00a0Because San Francisco politicians have stopped the police from enforcing quality of life crimes.\nTherefore homeless people are all over the place - urinating and defecating in the streets, panhandling, and, when they need money to buy booze or drugs, committing crimes.\nThe situation is out of control and a disgrace. \u00a0And that's what happens when liberal politicians demand that the police stop enforcing laws.\nLook, there's a civility factor in this country.\nWith nearly 325-million folks living here, there have to be standards of behavior.\nBut in San Francisco, there are not. \u00a0You can do whatever you want and therefore a beautiful city has now become blighted.\nAdd to that insane social policies, like San Francisco's General Assistance policy.\nReady? \u00a0The city gives indigent people - homeless, those roaming around - three hundred bucks a month cash and benefits.\nAnd where does that money go? \u00a0Many times to purchase drugs and alcohol.\nSo if you are a West Coast drug addict, where would you go?\nSan Francisco of course - where the free money is.\nSumming up, terrible laws, cowardly politicians, and apathetic voters all lead to chaos.\nPeople continue to die in Chicago. \u00a0And San Francisco is a chaotic mess.\nBut, unless voters wise up, nothing will change.\nAnd that's \"The Memo\".", "video_clips": [], "remaining_transcript": "As we have been reporting, the city of Chicago is the most violent place in America and little is being done about the incredible murder rate in some black neighborhoods.\nA quick look at the stats: last year murders in Chicago were up 57% from 2015, shooting incidents up 46%, shooting victims up 47%.\nOn New Year's Day, 28 more people shot in Chicago.\nIt is obvious that Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Governor Bruce Rauner will not protect innocent people and solve the problem.\nBut what is the problem?\nThe vast majority of shootings are being done by low-level gang members who are running wild in the streets.\nAn investigation by the Chicago Sun-Times shows that even if the cops do find a gang member with a gun, that person is given a very light sentence - maybe a year in prison.\nSo the justice system in Chicago is not punishing the thugs convicted of carrying illegal weapons with any severity.\nThat's problem number one.\nSecondly, there's policing.\nHere in New York City, shooting incidents are at a record low. \u00a0And this is a tougher town than Chicago.\nThe reason shootings are down is because the New York police target the gangs and arrest them for any and all violations.\nThey hound gang members, truth be told.\nBut in Chicago, the opposite is true. \u00a0The police do not want any part of engaging violent gang members.\nWhy?
