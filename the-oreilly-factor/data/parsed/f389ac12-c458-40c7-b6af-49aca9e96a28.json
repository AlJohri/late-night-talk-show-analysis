There are others who say we must obey the Geneva Convention even we are fighting an enemy that does not fall under that treaty.\nThen there is the definition of torture. Some believe that subjecting a captive to loud noise or verbal threats is torture. So, it's useless too debate the issue because minds will not change.\nEnter a report by Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee it says that the CIA tortured captured al Qaeda suspects and lied to Congress about it. The Senate Intel Committee is comprised of 8 Democrats and seven Republicans.\nAll of the Republicans, all of them refuse to endorse the report, which by the way, cost $40 million to produce. The GOP senators did that because they feel it's a partisan situation designed to embarrass the Bush administration.\nThe report concludes that harsh interrogations did not produce a single critical intelligence nugget that could not have been obtained by non- coercive means.\nNow, I have spoken directly to senior members of the CIA who say that conclusion is false. They strongly assert that coerced information saved thousands of lives. They point to the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to prove their point.\nI wasn't there. I don't know what happened. But I can tell you that a number of high ranking CIA people are furious and swear the Senate report is misleading. Some say the report should never have been released because it puts U.S. operatives around the world in danger.\nI don't dispute that opinion. But, in an open society, if the CIA or any other federal agency breaks the law we the people should know it. That being said talking points does believe the report is a partisan play that will solve nothing, here is President Bush.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nFORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: I knew the directors.

As we all know the jihadists are beheading Americans today and they will kill any American they can. It's not theory it's reality.
