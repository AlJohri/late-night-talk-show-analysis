   <p xml:id="2" begin="00:00:03.136" end="00:00:22.422">&quot;THE FACTOR&quot; BEGINS RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt;&gt; HI, I’M BILL.</p>
   <p xml:id="3" begin="00:00:22.422" end="00:00:25.325">AS YOU KNOW, I AM A SIMPLE MAN. LAST NIGHT SENATOR KERRY AND </p>
   <p xml:id="4" begin="00:00:25.325" end="00:00:28.995">PRESIDENT OBAMA TOLD THE WORLD  THAT A COMPROMISE HAD BEEN </p>
   <p xml:id="5" begin="00:00:28.995" end="00:00:32.265">REACHED WITH IRAN OVER NUCLEAR  WEAPONS.</p>
   <p xml:id="6" begin="00:00:32.265" end="00:00:33.366">IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS  CONTROVERSY.</p>
   <p xml:id="7" begin="00:00:33.366" end="00:00:36.870">WE MUST BE SKEPTICAL HERE. FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE FOLKS </p>
   <p xml:id="8" begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:41.374">THAT DON’T CARE IF IRAN GIVES UP ITS NUKES.</p>
   <p xml:id="9" begin="00:00:41.374" end="00:00:43.810">ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE, THERE ARE  AMERICANS WHO WILL OPPOSE </p>
   <p xml:id="10" begin="00:00:43.810" end="00:00:45.946">ANYTHING PRESIDENT OBAMA DOES. THEREFORE, THEY WILL OBJECT TO </p>
   <p xml:id="11" begin="00:00:45.946" end="00:00:48.215">THE DEAL WITH IRAN ON THAT  BASIS.</p>
   <p xml:id="12" begin="00:00:48.215" end="00:00:51.852">SO LET’S PUT THOSE TWO GROUPS  ASIDE FOR A MOMENT.</p>
   <p xml:id="13" begin="00:00:51.852" end="00:00:55.288">THERE ARE TWO KEY THINGS IN  PLACE.</p>
   <p xml:id="14" begin="00:00:55.288" end="00:00:58.992">FIRST, THE AGREEMENT SLOWS DOWN  BUT DOES NOT STOP IRAN’S </p>
   <p xml:id="15" begin="00:00:58.992" end="00:01:03.096">DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THAT’S WHY THE ISRAELIS ARE SO </p>
   <p xml:id="16" begin="00:01:03.096" end="00:01:07.567">ANGRY. THEY WANT IRAN’S NUCLEAR PROGRAM</p>
   <p xml:id="17" begin="00:01:07.567" end="00:01:14.641">TO STOP ENRICH URANIUM, THE  URANIUM THEY ALREADY HAS </p>
   <p xml:id="18" begin="00:01:14.641" end="00:01:16.243">DESTROYED. BUT UNDER THIS DEAL, IT’S NOT </p>
   <p xml:id="19" begin="00:01:16.243" end="00:01:17.944">GOING TO HAPPEN. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS THIS IS </p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:01:17.944" end="00:01:23.617">JUST THE FIRST PART OF THE DEAL. MORE STRINGENT CONTROLS WILL BE </p>
   <p xml:id="21" begin="00:01:23.617" end="00:01:26.453">BROUGHT AFTER SIX MONTHS. THE ANTI-OBAMA FORCES DON’T </p>
   <p xml:id="22" begin="00:01:26.453" end="00:01:30.390">BELIEVE THAT WILL HAPPEN. ON THE OTHER HAND, MANY BELIEVE </p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:01:30.390" end="00:01:33.860">IT’S GOOD, THAT TALKING WITH  THEM IS BETTER THAN SHOOTING AT </p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:01:33.860" end="00:01:36.096">THEM. AND THOUGH SOME SANCTIONS ARE </p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:01:36.096" end="00:01:41.701">LIFTED, MOST STAY IN PLACE AND  CAN BE REINSTITUTED, OR SO THE </p>
   <p xml:id="26" begin="00:01:41.701" end="00:01:43.803">PRESIDENT SAYS. TO BOLSTER THAT POINT OF VIEW, </p>
   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:43.803" end="00:01:48.975">YOU CAN LEGITIMATELY SAY THE  SANCTIONS HAVE WORKED.</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:48.975" end="00:01:52.746">IRAN IS KEEPING THEIR BEHAVIOR  IN CHANNELS BECAUSE OF THE </p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:52.746" end="00:01:58.585">SANCTIONS. BUT CUTTING TO THE NUKE CHASE.</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:58.585" end="00:02:00.587">SOME SAY WE COULD HAVE MADE A  BETTER DEAL.</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:02:00.587" end="00:02:06.293">IF WE HAD HELD OUT FOR A FEW  MORE MONTHS, THE IRANIAN ECONOMY</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:02:06.293" end="00:02:09.996">WOULD HAVE GOTTEN WORSE AND WE  WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A STRONGER </p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:02:09.996" end="00:02:13.233">POSITION TO MAKE IRAN GIVE UP  MUCH MORE.</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:02:13.233" end="00:02:16.736">BUT WITH THE TROUBLE OVER OBAMA  CARE, HE WANTED TO MAKE THE DEAL</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:02:16.736" end="00:02:21.341">TO DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP AND TO STOP THE PUBLIC OPINION LEADING.</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:02:21.341" end="00:02:26.179">BUT THAT MIGHT NOT WORK, AS SOME DEMOCRATS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH</p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:02:26.179" end="00:02:29.015">SOME BIG JEWISH POPULATIONS LIKE NEW YORK, DON’T LIKE THE DEAL.</p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:02:29.015" end="00:02:34.454">NOW THERE IS A MOVE IN CONGRESS  TO IMPOSE EVEN STRICTER </p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:02:34.454" end="00:02:36.156">SANCTIONS. OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT WOULD </p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:02:36.156" end="00:02:39.125">VETO THAT IF IT EVER PASSED. THERE YOU HAVE IT.</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:02:39.125" end="00:02:45.765">THE DEAL DELAYS BUT DOES NOT  PREVENT IRANIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS.</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:02:45.765" end="00:02:51.071">THE PRESIDENT SAYS A BETTER  DEAL IS FORTHCOMING.</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:51.071" end="00:02:57.377">OTHERS SAY IRAN WILL CHEAT ALL  DAY LONG.</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:57.377" end="00:02:59.079">JOHN McCAIN, A FOREIGN POLICY  EXPERT.</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:59.079" end="00:03:01.648">AM I MAKING ANY MISTAKES,  SENATOR?</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:03:01.648" end="00:03:05.018">&gt;&gt; NO, YOU’RE NOT, BILL. I WOULD ADD THAT THERE ARE THREE</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:03:05.018" end="00:03:06.920">FACTORS IN DEVELOPING NUCLEAR  WEAPONS.</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:03:06.920" end="00:03:10.090">ONE IS THE MATERIAL ITSELF, THE  OTHER IS THE WEAPON THAT WOULD </p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:03:10.090" end="00:03:16.396">GO ON THE MISSILE, AND THE OTHER TWO THERE PRECEDING THE PACE.</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:03:16.396" end="00:03:23.069">SECOND OF ALL, WE LOOK AT IRAN  ON THE ISSUE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:03:23.069" end="00:03:28.074">THEY’RE SENDING 5,000 HIZBOLLAH  TO SYRIA AND BRAGGING ABOUT </p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:03:28.074" end="00:03:31.778">BEING IN SYRIA KILLING SYRIANS. THEY ARE SPREADING TERROR </p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:03:31.778" end="00:03:35.048">THROUGHOUT THE REGION. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE </p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:03:35.048" end="00:03:38.551">DEATHS OF AMERICANS, AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT ON THIS WHOLE </p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:03:38.551" end="00:03:44.190">ISSUE OF RIGHT TO ENRICH,  THEY’VE CHEATED, THEY’VE LIED, </p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:03:44.190" end="00:03:49.396">THEY’VE PROVERICATED FOR YEARS  AND YEARS AND YEARS, AND THE </p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:03:49.396" end="00:03:51.631">FUNDAMENTAL HAS TO BE THEY DON’T HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENRICH.</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:03:51.631" end="00:03:54.667">IF YOU LOOK AT THE FINAL PRINT  ON THIS AGREEMENT, YOU’LL SEE </p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:03:54.667" end="00:03:57.771">BASICALLY WE HAVE CONCEDED THAT. THAT’S OUTRAGEOUS AND </p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:03:57.771" end="00:04:02.976">RIDICULOUS, AND BY THE WAY, OUR  CENTRIFUGES CONTINUE TO SPIN.</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:04:02.976" end="00:04:06.446">THE FACILITY IN IRAQ IS NOT  DISMANTLED AND FRANKLY WE’VE </p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:04:06.446" end="00:04:09.716">SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE. &gt;&gt; YOU’RE AGAINST THE DEAL.</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:04:09.716" end="00:04:13.853">LET’S TAKE IT ONE BY ONE. IS IT BETTER FOR THE UNITED </p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:04:13.853" end="00:04:17.824">STATES TO BE TALKING WITH THESE  PEOPLE THAN TO JUST SAY, LOOK, </p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:04:17.824" end="00:04:21.094">OUR WAY OR THE HIGHWAY, BECAUSE  YOU KNOW THEY’LL TAKE THE </p>

   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:04:26.299" end="00:04:27.867">SO I AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT  YOU SAID.</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:04:27.867" end="00:04:32.072">I MEAN, WE CERTAINLY DON’T HAVE  ANY ASSURANCE THAT THEY’RE NOT </p>
