   <p xml:id="21" begin="00:00:55.789" end="00:01:01.628">WAS ANY INDICATION, THEY HATE ME AND YOU EQUALLY.</p>
   <p xml:id="22" begin="00:01:01.628" end="00:01:07.334">&gt;&gt; THAT’S ANOTHER SUBJECT ALL TOGETHER.</p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:01:07.334" end="00:01:10.570">ASK OURSELVES A KEY QUESTION WHEN WE ASK A NEWS STORY AND</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:01:10.570" end="00:01:12.506">THAT IS HOW DOES IT EFFECT ME?</p>

   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:21.648" end="00:01:25.051">BECAUSE WE LIKE SHINY OBJECTS SO AS LONG AS THERE</p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:25.051" end="00:01:28.321">IS FIRE IN THE SHOT OR PEOPLE GETTING THEIR HEADS</p>

   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:30.957" end="00:01:32.793">DON’T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE DETAILS.</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:01:32.793" end="00:01:35.295">THAT’S NUMBER ONE. I HAVE THREE REASONS.</p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:01:35.295" end="00:01:40.033">REASON NUMBER 2. COMPLEX FOREIGN STORIES</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:40.033" end="00:01:46.473">DON’T REALLY LEND THEMSELVES TO THE FUN DEBATE FORMAT</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:01:46.473" end="00:01:48.809">THAT TELEVISION NEWS HAS MADE SO POPULAR.</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:01:48.809" end="00:01:53.647">SO A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN A LIBERAL PROFESSOR FROM YALE</p>

   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:01:56.583" end="00:02:00.787">ISN’T EXACTLY BILL O’REILLY VERSUS BARNEY FRANK.</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:02:00.787" end="00:02:03.690">IT JUST DOESN’T CUT IT. AND THE THIRD REASON IS THE</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:02:03.690" end="00:02:07.060">MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ENCOMPASSES ALL OF THE</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:02:07.060" end="00:02:09.229">REASONS. AND THAT IS FOREIGN NEWS BY</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:02:09.229" end="00:02:12.432">AND LARGE JUST ISN’T ENTERTAINING ENOUGH FOR US.</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:12.432" end="00:02:16.269">AND IT’S REALLY AS SIMPLE AS THAT WE LIKE EASY-TO-FOLLOW</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:16.269" end="00:02:19.873">STORY LINES AND COMPLEX STORIES FROM EASTERN EUROPE</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:19.873" end="00:02:26.046">OR ASIA OR SOUTH AMERICA THEY DON’T AMUSE US THE WAY</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:26.046" end="00:02:29.249">WE LIKE TO BE AMUSED. &gt;&gt; UNLESS AMERICAN TROOPS</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:29.249" end="00:02:41.528">ARE INVOLVED OR AVILLE VAN. &gt;&gt; I EVEN DISAGREE WITH THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:41.528" end="00:02:43.263">AFGHANISTAN AMERICAN TROOPS ARE INVOLVED THEY ARE</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:43.263" end="00:02:45.365">GETTING KILLED AND WE DON’T CARE ABOUT THAT.</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:45.365" end="00:02:48.568">&gt;&gt; 10 YEARS OLD. BEGINNING OF THE AFGHAN WAR</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:48.568" end="00:02:51.371">LOTS OF COVERAGE. ONCE IT BEGINS TO GET 10 OR</p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:02:51.371" end="00:02:53.340">12 YEARS OLD IT’S THE SAME STORY.</p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:02:53.340" end="00:03:00.814">&gt;&gt; THAT’S RIGHT. IT DOESN’T AMUSE US OR</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:03:00.814" end="00:03:03.383">ENTERTAIN US. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE AT CBS NEWS WHEN</p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:03:03.383" end="00:03:05.552">TV WAS INVENTED. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS IN THE</p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:03:05.552" end="00:03:09.122">NECESSARY. &gt;&gt; GODFREY, A FEW MUPPETS.</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:03:09.122" end="00:03:11.525">YOU CAN THEN BRING, DID IT USED TO WHEN CHRON SCIATIC</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:03:11.525" end="00:03:17.364">WAS THERE AND ALL OF THIS BUSINESS, MURROW, WAS THERE</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:03:17.364" end="00:03:20.534">MORE OF AN APPETITE IN THE AMERICAN PUBLIC BACK IN THE</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:03:20.534" end="00:03:22.235">50S AND 60’S THAN NOW? &gt;&gt; HE YES.</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:03:22.235" end="00:03:25.639">I WILL GIVE YOU TWO REASONS, I THINK.</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:03:25.639" end="00:03:29.376">ONE IS DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE LIVE IN AN INFORMATION</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:03:29.376" end="00:03:33.413">AGE, I MEAN, THERE IS FAR MORE OUTLETS FOR NEWS TODAY</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:03:33.413" end="00:03:39.019">THAN WHEN I WORKED FOR WALTER CRONKITE.</p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:03:39.019" end="00:03:42.155">IN A LOT OF WAYS WE ARE SHALLOWER THAN WE USED TO</p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:03:42.155" end="00:03:44.791">BE. WE ARE MORE INTERESTED IN</p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:03:44.791" end="00:03:47.327">BEING SOCIABLE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA, FOR INSTANCE, THAN WE</p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:03:47.327" end="00:03:49.996">ARE WITH BEING KNOWLEDGEABLE.</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:03:49.996" end="00:03:57.170">SO, I THINK A LOT OF AMERICANS DON’T KNOW MUCH</p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:03:57.170" end="00:03:59.472">ABOUT AMERICA AND DON’T CARE AS MUCH AS WE USED TO.</p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="00:03:59.472" end="00:04:01.541">IF WE DON’T CARE ABOUT AMERICA WE SURE AREN’T GOING</p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="00:04:01.541" end="00:04:06.780">TO CARE ABOUT THE UKRAINE. &gt;&gt; I HAVE THEORY ABOUT THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:10.684">WHEN MY FATHER WENT TO WORLD WAR II AS A NAVAL OFFICER IN</p>
   <p xml:id="74" begin="00:04:10.684" end="00:04:15.021">THE PACIFIC, MY WHOLE FAMILY WAS GALVANIZED AROUND WHAT</p>
   <p xml:id="75" begin="00:04:15.021" end="00:04:16.790">WAS HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY.</p>
   <p xml:id="76" begin="00:04:16.790" end="00:04:20.860">WE HAD TO DEFEAT JAPAN. WE HAD TO DEFEAT GERMANY.</p>
   <p xml:id="77" begin="00:04:20.860" end="00:04:25.665">SO THERE WAS THIS TREMENDOUS EMOTION INVESTED.</p>
   <p xml:id="78" begin="00:04:25.665" end="00:04:27.267">PEOPLE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE.</p>
   <p xml:id="79" begin="00:04:27.267" end="00:04:29.235">OUR MILITARY FORCES. EVERYBODY WAS INVOLVED.</p>
   <p xml:id="80" begin="00:04:29.235" end="00:04:31.705">PEOPLE BACK HOME. PEOPLE OVER THERE ONCE THE</p>
   <p xml:id="81" begin="00:04:31.705" end="00:04:34.874">WAR ENDED, THAT EMOTION DIDN’T END.</p>
   <p xml:id="82" begin="00:04:34.874" end="00:04:37.844">SO THAT THE PEOPLE TOOK MORE OF AN INTEREST IN THEIR</p>
   <p xml:id="83" begin="00:04:37.844" end="00:04:41.014">COUNTRY AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING OVERSEAS THAN HERE</p>
   <p xml:id="84" begin="00:04:41.014" end="00:04:44.184">AND THERE BECAUSE THAT WAS INCULCATED IN THEM BY WORLD</p>
   <p xml:id="85" begin="00:04:44.184" end="00:04:46.219">WAR II. AND THAT’S WHY THEY CALL IT</p>
   <p xml:id="86" begin="00:04:46.219" end="00:04:49.456">THE GREATEST GENERATION, THE SACRIFICES WERE TREMENDOUS.</p>
   <p xml:id="87" begin="00:04:49.456" end="00:04:53.293">ONCE YOU GET AWAY FROM THAT MASS EVENT.</p>
   <p xml:id="88" begin="00:04:53.293" end="00:04:57.497">THE FURTHER AWAY YOU GO AND YOU BECOME SAFE AND SECURE</p>
   <p xml:id="89" begin="00:04:57.497" end="00:05:00.667">AND THAT -- IN 2001 THAT ATTACK THAT JOLTED US OUT OF</p>
   <p xml:id="90" begin="00:05:00.667" end="00:05:02.669">THERE A LITTLE BIT. BUT NOW WE ARE BACK THERE.</p>
   <p xml:id="91" begin="00:05:02.669" end="00:05:04.137">&gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT’S MY THEORY ON IT.</p>
   <p xml:id="92" begin="00:05:04.137" end="00:05:06.072">&gt;&gt; NO. I THINK THAT’S A GOOD</p>
   <p xml:id="93" begin="00:05:06.072" end="00:05:08.508">THEORY. ADD TO THAT, THAT OVER THE</p>
   <p xml:id="94" begin="00:05:08.508" end="00:05:11.578">YEARS NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, THE ONES THAT WE WORK FOR,</p>
   <p xml:id="95" begin="00:05:11.578" end="00:05:14.447">FOR INSTANCE, AT THE BROADCAST NETWORKS HAVE</p>

   <p xml:id="97" begin="00:05:17.150" end="00:05:20.754">SO THIS IS A CHICKEN AND EGG ARGUMENT.</p>
   <p xml:id="98" begin="00:05:20.754" end="00:05:24.357">DO WE HAVE LESS INTEREST IN FOREIGN NEWS TODAY BECAUSE</p>
   <p xml:id="99" begin="00:05:24.357" end="00:05:29.062">THE NETWORKS ARE COVERING LESS FOREIGN NEWS OR ARE</p>
   <p xml:id="100" begin="00:05:29.062" end="00:05:32.599">THEY COVERING LESS FOREIGN NEWS BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE</p>
   <p xml:id="101" begin="00:05:32.599" end="00:05:34.200">HAVE LESS INTEREST IN FOREIGN NEWS?</p>
   <p xml:id="102" begin="00:05:34.200" end="00:05:38.371">&gt;&gt; IT’S THE LATTER AND THEY TAKE AS YOU KNOW SURVEYS AND</p>
   <p xml:id="103" begin="00:05:38.371" end="00:05:39.906">THEY TAKE ALL KINDS OF THINGS.</p>
   <p xml:id="104" begin="00:05:39.906" end="00:05:43.276">IT’S THE LATTER. BUT THEY USED TO NOT CARE.</p>
   <p xml:id="105" begin="00:05:43.276" end="00:05:47.247">SEE, WHEN I COVERED THE EL SALVADOR WAR, NOBODY CARED</p>
   <p xml:id="106" begin="00:05:47.247" end="00:05:49.482">WHAT WAS HAPPENING DOWN THERE BUT THEY COVERED IT</p>
   <p xml:id="107" begin="00:05:49.482" end="00:05:50.617">ANYWAY. NOW THEY DON’T DO IT BECAUSE</p>
   <p xml:id="108" begin="00:05:50.617" end="00:05:52.252">THEY WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY.</p>
