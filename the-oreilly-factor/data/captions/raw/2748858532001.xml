   <p xml:id="3" begin="00:00:04.271" end="00:00:06.273">PICTURE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. WHERE THE SENATE IS</p>

   <p xml:id="5" begin="00:00:08.175" end="00:00:11.411">WE EXPECT THAT VOTE WILL PASS FAIRLY EASILY.</p>
   <p xml:id="6" begin="00:00:11.411" end="00:00:13.780">SO, WHAT WE’RE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE GOING TO WING IT</p>
   <p xml:id="7" begin="00:00:13.780" end="00:00:16.850">HERE FOR A WHILE. GET A LITTLE VOTE AND WE ARE</p>
   <p xml:id="8" begin="00:00:16.850" end="00:00:19.319">GOING IT DO OUR REGULAR FACTOR.</p>
   <p xml:id="9" begin="00:00:19.319" end="00:00:21.989">BUT, THE PRESIDENT MAY SPEAK DURING THIS HOUR.</p>
   <p xml:id="10" begin="00:00:21.989" end="00:00:25.158">IF HE DOES, I’M GOING TO THROW TO MY PAL BRET BAIER</p>
   <p xml:id="11" begin="00:00:25.158" end="00:00:26.893">WHO IS STANDING BY IN WASHINGTON.</p>
   <p xml:id="12" begin="00:00:26.893" end="00:00:28.395">YOU DOWN THERE, BAIER? &gt;&gt; I AM.</p>
   <p xml:id="13" begin="00:00:28.395" end="00:00:31.298">HI, BILL. &gt;&gt; THAT A BOY.</p>
   <p xml:id="14" begin="00:00:31.298" end="00:00:35.202">&gt;&gt; I AM WORKING INDEED. &gt;&gt; IF BARACK OBAMA COMES UP</p>
   <p xml:id="15" begin="00:00:35.202" end="00:00:37.704">TO CURTAIN CALL, WHATEVER IS HE GOING TO DO TONIGHT.</p>
   <p xml:id="16" begin="00:00:37.704" end="00:00:40.140">I’M GOING IT HAND IT OVER TO YOU AND CAN YOU TAKE IT, ALL</p>
   <p xml:id="17" begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:42.075">RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THAT SOUNDS GOOD.</p>
   <p xml:id="18" begin="00:00:42.075" end="00:00:44.344">&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. NOW, IN THE MEANTIME, DOES</p>
   <p xml:id="19" begin="00:00:44.344" end="00:00:49.116">THIS BILL HAVE A NAME TO IT? I MEAN, WHAT EXACTLY -- I</p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:00:49.116" end="00:00:51.451">KNOW THEY ARE VOTING TO REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT AND GO</p>

   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:00:56.857" end="00:00:59.426">I KNOW ALL OF THAT, BUT IS THERE A NAME?</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:00:59.426" end="00:01:02.529">IS IT LONNIE’S BILL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?</p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:01:02.529" end="00:01:06.733">&gt;&gt; NO. IT’S AN H.R. AND 2775.</p>
   <p xml:id="26" begin="00:01:06.733" end="00:01:10.537">THE REASON IT’S H.R. IS IT’S A HOUSE BILL STARTED IN THE</p>
   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:10.537" end="00:01:13.740">HOUSE. IT HAS TO GO TO THE SENATE.</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:15.776">OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE PUTTING ALL OF THE DEAL IN THERE AND</p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:15.776" end="00:01:17.577">THEN THEY WILL SEND IT BACK TO THE HOUSE.</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:17.577" end="00:01:19.279">AS YOU KNOW IN THE CONSTITUTION, THE FUNDING</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:19.279" end="00:01:21.181">FOR THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO START IN THE HOUSE.</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:01:21.181" end="00:01:25.085">THAT’S WHY THEY HAVE THIS HOUSE VEHICLE H.R. 2775.</p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:01:25.085" end="00:01:28.689">SO THAT IS THE OFFICIAL. &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO REAL NAME ON</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:28.689" end="00:01:31.525">IT. THE SENATE DOES KICKS IT</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:01:31.525" end="00:01:34.127">BACK TO THE HOUSE. THESE GUYS GOT TO STAY UP</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:01:34.127" end="00:01:36.863">LATE TONIGHT. WE JUST HEARD BOEHNER IN THE</p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:01:36.863" end="00:01:39.399">COLD OPEN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSES HE THINKS HE LOST.</p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:01:39.399" end="00:01:41.835">IS THAT THE PREVAILING WISDOM YOU ARE HEARING THE</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:01:41.835" end="00:01:43.770">REPUBLICAN PARTY THINKS THEY LOST IN THIS?</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:46.506">&gt;&gt; YEAH, I MEAN, THEY DIDN’T GET A LOT OF OUT OF IT.</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:01:46.506" end="00:01:48.642">AND THEY ARE BACKED UP AGAINST THE WALL AND THE</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:01:48.642" end="00:01:52.746">HOUSE WILL VOTE. THE SENATE JUST VOTED 83-16</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:01:52.746" end="00:01:55.182">OVER THAT CLOTURE VOTE. SO THAT WAS THE BIG VOTE TO</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:01:55.182" end="00:01:57.484">WATCH IN THE SENATE. NOW THEY ARE GOING IT VOTE</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:01:57.484" end="00:01:59.252">CURRENTLY AND GOING TO PASS IT RIGHT OUT OF THERE.</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:01:59.252" end="00:02:01.154">IT GOES TO THE HOUSE AND THEY ARE JAMMED.</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:01.154" end="00:02:02.856">THEY DON’T HAVE ANY OTHER OPTIONS.</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:02.856" end="00:02:05.158">SO, THAT IS THE PREVAILING WISDOM THAT REPUBLICANS WERE</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:05.158" end="00:02:08.261">ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THIS, THAT, PERHAPS, THE TACTICS</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:08.261" end="00:02:10.430">WERE WRONG FROM THE BEGINNING, MANY REPUBLICANS</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:10.430" end="00:02:13.533">SAYING THAT. BUT, IN THE BIG PICTURE,</p>

   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:02:50.303" end="00:02:52.406">WE HAVE GOT TO CUT A LITTLE BIT OF SPENDING.</p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:02:52.406" end="00:02:54.341">MAYBE THEY WILL GET IT DONE, PROBABLY NOT.</p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:02:54.341" end="00:02:57.811">BUT, LET’S JUST KEEP OPTIMISTIC FOR TONIGHT.</p>
