   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:08.435" end="00:01:11.504">&gt;&gt; THAT’S WHY THE POLLS ON CHRISTIE ARE NO GOOD BECAUSE</p>

   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:19.679" end="00:01:22.682">THIS I THINK THAT HE BUILT A REPUTATION FOR BEING A</p>

   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:26.953" end="00:01:30.156">SO I THINK TO SOME EXTENT IT IT DOES HELP HIM.</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:01:30.156" end="00:01:32.926">WHAT HURTS HIM IS THIS IDEA THAT HE HAS SURROUNDED</p>

   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:01:45.271" end="00:01:48.108">SO THAT MIGHT CHIP AWAY AT THE IMAGE A LITTLE BIT.</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:01:48.108" end="00:01:50.110">ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS COULD TOUGHEN HIM UP.</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:01:50.110" end="00:01:53.079">THIS COULD HARDEN THE GUY BECAUSE, WHAT SHOULD OCCUR</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:01:53.079" end="00:01:55.782">TO CHRIS CHRISTIE IS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS NOT HIS</p>
