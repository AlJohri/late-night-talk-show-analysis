   <p xml:id="2" begin="00:00:04.404" end="00:00:07.874">SPEAKING AT THE WHITE HOUSE, MR. OBAMA ONCE AGAIN SAID THAT THE </p>
   <p xml:id="3" begin="00:00:07.874" end="00:00:12.879">COMPUTER PROBLEMS AND OTHER  CHAOS SURROUNDING OBAMA CARE ARE</p>
   <p xml:id="4" begin="00:00:12.879" end="00:00:15.582">HIS RESPONSIBILITY. &gt;&gt; THAT’S ON ME.</p>
   <p xml:id="5" begin="00:00:15.582" end="00:00:19.719">I MEAN, WE FUMBLED THE ROLLOUT  ON THIS HEALTH CARE LAW.</p>
   <p xml:id="6" begin="00:00:19.719" end="00:00:23.089">THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF  THINGS ABOUT IT THAT ARE WORKING</p>
   <p xml:id="7" begin="00:00:23.089" end="00:00:28.194">REALLY WELL. WHICH PEOPLE DIDN’T NOTICE.</p>
   <p xml:id="8" begin="00:00:28.194" end="00:00:30.497">BECAUSE THEY WEREN’T  CONTROVERSIAL.</p>
   <p xml:id="9" begin="00:00:30.497" end="00:00:35.268">WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT THESE  MARKETPLACES CREATING A PLACE </p>
   <p xml:id="10" begin="00:00:35.268" end="00:00:41.107">WHERE PEOPLE CAN SHOP AND  THROUGH COMPETITION GET A BETTER</p>
   <p xml:id="11" begin="00:00:41.107" end="00:00:43.710">DEAL FOR THE HEALTH INSURANCE  THAT THEIR FAMILIES NEED.</p>
   <p xml:id="12" begin="00:00:43.710" end="00:00:47.681">WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT THAT WAS  GOING TO BE COMPLICATED.</p>
   <p xml:id="13" begin="00:00:47.681" end="00:00:53.086">&gt;&gt; IF YOU ALWAYS KNEW, WHY  DIDN’T YOU TELL WE THE PEOPLE </p>
   <p xml:id="14" begin="00:00:53.086" end="00:00:57.490">WHO HAD NO IDEA? INSTEAD, THE INTRODUCTION OF </p>
   <p xml:id="15" begin="00:00:57.490" end="00:01:04.798">OBAMA CARE WAS SOLD FOR 3 1/2  YEARS AS A MAKING ANY OF </p>
   <p xml:id="16" begin="00:01:04.798" end="00:01:06.633">MAKING  ANY OF SEPTEMBER GOVERNMENT </p>
   <p xml:id="17" begin="00:01:06.633" end="00:01:10.236">PROGRAM WITH LITTLE DOWN SIDE. WHILE THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED TO</p>
   <p xml:id="18" begin="00:01:10.236" end="00:01:15.542">PRAISE THE OVERALL LAW, HE DID  ADDRESS THE OVERSELLING.</p>
   <p xml:id="19" begin="00:01:15.542" end="00:01:18.912">&gt;&gt; WE RESPECT THE PLEDGE I MADE  THAT IF YOU LIKE YOUR PLAN, YOU </p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:01:18.912" end="00:01:22.916">CAN KEEP IT. I THINK AND I’VE SAID IN </p>
   <p xml:id="21" begin="00:01:22.916" end="00:01:28.388">INTERVIEWS THAT THERE IS NO  DOUBT THAT THE WAY I PUT THAT </p>
   <p xml:id="22" begin="00:01:28.388" end="00:01:34.160">FORWARD UNEQUIVOCALLY ENDED UP  NOT BEING ACCURATE.</p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:01:34.160" end="00:01:38.264">IT WAS NOT BECAUSE OF MY  INTENTION NOT TO DELIVER ON THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:01:38.264" end="00:01:42.402">COMMITMENT AND THAT PROMISE. WE PUT A GRANDFATHER CLAUSE INTO</p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:01:42.402" end="00:01:45.338">THE LAW. BUT IT WAS INSUFFICIENT.</p>
   <p xml:id="26" begin="00:01:45.338" end="00:01:47.874">&gt;&gt; TRUE. BUT FOR WEEKS, THAT WAS NOT </p>
   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:47.874" end="00:01:50.343">ACKNOWLEDGED BY YOU, MR.  PRESIDENT.</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:50.343" end="00:01:57.150">AND ONLY WHEN POWERFUL SENATORS  IN YOUR OWN PARTY BEGAN </p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:57.150" end="00:01:59.052">INTRODUCTION LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH HEALTH INSURANCE PROBLEMS </p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:59.052" end="00:02:02.555">DID YOU RESPOND. SO IN ORDER TO STOP THAT </p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:02:02.555" end="00:02:07.627">LEGISLATION COLD, THE PRESIDENT  IS NOW SAYING THIS.</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:02:07.627" end="00:02:16.770">&gt;&gt; INSURERS CAN EXTEND CURRENT  PLANS INTO 2014 AND AMERICANS </p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:02:16.770" end="00:02:19.938">WHOSE PLANS HAVE BEEN CANCELED  CAN REENROLL IN THE SAME KIND OF</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:02:19.938" end="00:02:21.540">PLAN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT OF COURSE WILL CAUSE</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:02:21.540" end="00:02:25.010">ESPECIALLY MORE CHAOS. LET ME SEE A SHOW OF HANDS.</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:02:25.010" end="00:02:27.613">HOW MANY OF YOU BELIEVE  REENROLLING IN A CANCELED HEALTH</p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:02:27.613" end="00:02:32.718">INSURANCE PLAN WILL BE A FUN  ADVENTURE?</p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:02:32.718" end="00:02:35.621">ANYONE? BUEHLER?</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:02:35.621" end="00:02:40.292">GOING FORWARD MR. OBAMA IS  ANTICIPATING MANY MORE PROBLEMS.</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:02:40.292" end="00:02:42.728">THAT WAS EVIDENT WHEN HE SAID  THIS.</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:02:42.728" end="00:02:44.563">&gt;&gt; I SAID FROM THE BEGINNING I’M WILLING TO WORK WITH DEMOCRATS </p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:02:44.563" end="00:02:51.169">AND REPUBLICANS TO FIX PROBLEMS  AS THEY A RISE.</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:51.169" end="00:02:53.472">THIS IS AN EXAMPLE P WE CAN  ALWAYS MAKE THE LAW WORK BETTER.</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:53.472" end="00:02:57.776">I WILL NOT ACCEPT PROPOSALS THAT ARE JUST ANOTHER BRAZEN ATTEMPT </p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:57.776" end="00:03:00.345">TO UNDERMINE THE OVERALL LAW. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A SIGNAL TO </p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:03:00.345" end="00:03:03.815">REPUBLICANS THAT THE PRESIDENT  WILL VETO ANY ATTEMPT TO REPEAL </p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:03:03.815" end="00:03:07.019">OBAMA CARE. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, NO </p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:03:07.019" end="00:03:09.321">MATTER HOW MANY PROBLEMS  DEVELOP, TRUE BELIEVERS IN </p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:03:09.321" end="00:03:15.360">AFFORD ABLE HEALTH CARE LAW LIKE THE PRESIDENT WILL STAND BY IT.</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:17.529">IT’S THE GREATER GOOD  PROPOSITION THAT EVEN IF OBAMA </p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:03:17.529" end="00:03:21.266">CARE IS SCREWED UP BEYOND  BELIEF, IT’S BETTER FOR </p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:03:21.266" end="00:03:28.306">AMERICANS THAN WHAT WAS THERE. &gt;&gt; I’M NOT A PERFECT MAN AND I </p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:03:28.306" end="00:03:32.944">WILL NOT BE A PERFECT PRESIDENT. BUT I’LL WAKE UP EVERY SINGLE </p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:03:32.944" end="00:03:36.748">DAY WORKING AS HARD AS I CAN ON  BEHALF OF AMERICANS OUT THERE </p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:03:36.748" end="00:03:41.486">FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE WHO ARE  WORKING HARD MEETING THEIR </p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:03:41.486" end="00:03:46.358">RESPONSIBILITIES BUT SOMETIMES  ARE STRUGGLING BECAUSE THE WAY </p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:03:46.358" end="00:03:51.697">THE SYSTEM WORKS ISN’T GIVING  THEM A FAIR SHOT.</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:03:51.697" end="00:03:54.032">AND THAT PLEDGE I HAVEN’T  BROKEN.</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:03:54.032" end="00:04:00.172">&gt;&gt; WELL, THE OLD ADAGE IS  CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR.</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:04:00.172" end="00:04:06.278">ALL THE KING’S HORSES AND ALL  THE KING’S MEN MIGHT NOT BE ABLE</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:04:06.278" end="00:04:07.946">TO PUT OBAMA CARE BACK TOGETHER  AGAIN.</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:04:07.946" end="00:04:12.984">BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST FREE  MARKET PRINCIPLES.</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:04:12.984" end="00:04:16.688">BUT MORE FORPT IMPORTANTLY, IT  DEPENDS ON AN EFFICIENT </p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:04:16.688" end="00:04:23.261">DEMOCRACY TO IMPLEMENT IT. AND IN THIS CASE THERE ISN’T AN </p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:04:23.261" end="00:04:25.530">EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY.</p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:04:25.530" end="00:04:31.269">THE QUESTION IS WHY DON’T VERY  INTELLIGENT PEOPLE LIKE THE GUY </p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:04:31.269" end="00:04:34.406">WHO DESIGNED OBAMA CARE  UNDERSTAND THAT.</p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:04:34.406" end="00:04:37.876">&gt;&gt; IT’S NOT THE SAME AS THE  INSURANCE COMPANY SAYING YOU ARE</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:04:37.876" end="00:04:39.177">CANCELED AND NOW YOU’RE ON YOUR  OWN.</p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:04:39.177" end="00:04:45.317">DID YOU FORESEE THAT HAPPENING? &gt;&gt; THAT IS ABSOLUTELY -- HAVE </p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="00:04:45.317" end="00:04:51.022">CANCELED BECAUSE --  &gt;&gt; THAT’S IN THE ANSWER.</p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="00:04:51.022" end="00:04:52.858">YOU ARE NOT ANSWERING. &gt;&gt; THEY THINK THE EXCHANGE IS </p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="00:04:52.858" end="00:04:53.892">RISING. &gt;&gt; SIR, YOU’RE NOT ANSWERING.</p>
   <p xml:id="74" begin="00:04:53.892" end="00:05:01.466">&gt;&gt; I AM ANSWERING. THEIR BUSINESS DECISION SAYS THE</p>
   <p xml:id="75" begin="00:05:01.466" end="00:05:03.502">INDIVIDUAL MARKET IS DYING,  WE’LL GO TO THE EXCHANGE.</p>
   <p xml:id="76" begin="00:05:03.502" end="00:05:06.304">&gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID IF YOU LIKE YOUR PLAN, YOU CAN KEEP</p>
   <p xml:id="77" begin="00:05:06.304" end="00:05:08.874">IT PERIOD, YOU BELIEVE HE  GENUINELY BELIEVED THAT IN HIS </p>
   <p xml:id="78" begin="00:05:08.874" end="00:05:20.051">MIND AND THAT HE --  &gt;&gt; THE AFFORDABLE -- WHETHER YO </p>
   <p xml:id="79" begin="00:05:20.051" end="00:05:22.254">IRRELEVANT. &gt;&gt; I THINK I KNOW MY VIEWERS AND</p>
   <p xml:id="80" begin="00:05:22.254" end="00:05:23.688">I THINK THEY THINK THIS IS  RELEVANT.</p>
   <p xml:id="81" begin="00:05:23.688" end="00:05:27.125">&gt;&gt; SUMMING UP, WE CAN EXPECT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS SUPPORTERS </p>
   <p xml:id="82" begin="00:05:27.125" end="00:05:30.996">LIKE DR. EMANUEL TO COMPROMISE  ON SOME SMALL THINGS.</p>
   <p xml:id="83" begin="00:05:30.996" end="00:05:35.033">BUT NOT THE OVERALL OBAMA CARE  PROGRAM WHICH THEY WILL DEFEND </p>
   <p xml:id="84" begin="00:05:35.033" end="00:05:38.170">FOREVER. TO ADMIT IT’S NOT GOOD FOR THE </p>
   <p xml:id="85" begin="00:05:38.170" end="00:05:41.273">COUNTRY WOULD BE TO ADMIT THAT  BIG COUNTRY IS NOT GOOD.</p>
   <p xml:id="86" begin="00:05:41.273" end="00:05:44.476">THEREFORE, LIBERALISM IS NOT  GOOD.</p>
   <p xml:id="87" begin="00:05:44.476" end="00:05:46.578">AND THAT’S WHAT THIS IS ALL  ABOUT.</p>
   <p xml:id="88" begin="00:05:46.578" end="00:05:53.318">&gt;&gt;&gt; NEXT ON THE RUNDOWN, VERY  CONTROVERSIAL MEGAN WILL BE </p>
