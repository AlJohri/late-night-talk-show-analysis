   <p xml:id="12" begin="00:00:33.735" end="00:00:36.938">&gt;&gt; WE CAME OUT OFF THE WHITE HOUSE NOT ONLY DEAD BROKE</p>
   <p xml:id="13" begin="00:00:36.938" end="00:00:39.875">BUT IN DEBT. WE HAD NO MONEY WHEN WE GOT</p>
   <p xml:id="14" begin="00:00:39.875" end="00:00:43.078">THERE. AND WE STRUGGLED TO, YOU</p>
   <p xml:id="15" begin="00:00:43.078" end="00:00:47.048">KNOW, PIECE TOGETHER THE RESOURCES FOR MORTGAGES, FOR</p>
   <p xml:id="16" begin="00:00:47.048" end="00:00:50.318">HOUSES, FOR CHELSEA’S EDUCATION, YOU KNOW, IT WAS</p>
   <p xml:id="17" begin="00:00:50.318" end="00:00:52.387">NOT EASY. BILL HAS WORKED REALLY HARD</p>
   <p xml:id="18" begin="00:00:52.387" end="00:00:55.490">AND IT’S BEEN AMAZING TO ME. HE HAS WORKED VERY HARD,</p>
   <p xml:id="19" begin="00:00:55.490" end="00:00:58.426">FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO PAY OFF ALL OUR DEBTS WHICH WAS,</p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:00:58.426" end="00:01:00.729">YOU KNOW, HAD YOU TO MAKE DOUBLE THE MONEY BECAUSE OF</p>
   <p xml:id="21" begin="00:01:00.729" end="00:01:04.199">OBVIOUSLY TAXES AND THEN PAY OFF THE DEBTS AND GET US</p>
   <p xml:id="22" begin="00:01:04.199" end="00:01:05.767">HOUSES AND TAKE CARE OF FAMILY MEMBERS.</p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:01:05.767" end="00:01:08.737">&gt;&gt; SO THAT SOUNDS LIKE MANY AMERICANS WHO WORK HARD</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:01:08.737" end="00:01:11.506">MAKING MONEY TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR THEIR FAMILIES,</p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:01:11.506" end="00:01:14.209">NOT AS MUCH MONEY AS THE CLINTONS BUT YOU GET MY</p>
   <p xml:id="26" begin="00:01:14.209" end="00:01:16.244">POINT. HOWEVER, IF HILLARY CLINTON</p>
   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:16.244" end="00:01:21.883">RUNS FOR PRESIDENT, HOW CAN SHE EVEN MENTION INCOME</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:21.883" end="00:01:23.919">INEQUALITY? MRS. CLINTON GETS PAID ABOUT</p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:23.919" end="00:01:26.621">$200,000 FOR A SPEECH. AND SHE FLIES TO THE VENUE</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:26.621" end="00:01:28.523">IN A PRIVATE JET. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT?</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:28.523" end="00:01:30.792">THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT BILL AND HILLARY</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:01:30.792" end="00:01:33.528">CLINTON HAVE A UNIQUE POSITION IN THE WORLD AND</p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:01:33.528" end="00:01:36.198">MANY PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:36.198" end="00:01:38.366">MRS. CLINTON ALSO HAS A NEW BOOK OUT FOR WHICH SHE WAS</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:01:38.366" end="00:01:43.371">PAID MORE THAN $10 MILLION. AGAIN, NOTHING WRONG WITH</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:01:43.371" end="00:01:45.607">THAT. PUBLISHER BELIEVING IT WILL</p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:01:45.607" end="00:01:48.310">MAKE MONEY SEEING SELLING HILLARY’S BOOK.</p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:01:48.310" end="00:01:51.379">THAT’S CAPITALISM. BUT IT ALSO TAKES AWAY A BIG</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:01:51.379" end="00:01:53.348">ISSUE. THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:01:53.348" end="00:01:57.986">PUSHING IN ORDER TO RETAIN POLITICAL POWER INEQUALITY.</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:01:57.986" end="00:02:00.121">FOR HER BOOK ALONE MRS. CLINTON IS MAKING MORE</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:02:00.121" end="00:02:03.558">MONEY THAN MOST AMERICANS WILL MAKE IN THEIR ENTIRE</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:03.558" end="00:02:05.393">LIFETIMES. SO, IF YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:05.393" end="00:02:09.431">OF INCOME INEQUALITY, I BELIEVE HILLARY CLINTON IS</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:09.431" end="00:02:11.600">POSTER LADY. IN FACT, SHE DIDN’T EVEN</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:11.600" end="00:02:14.569">WRITE THE BOOK. OTHERS DID.</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:14.569" end="00:02:16.771">SHE PROVIDED NOTES, GUIDANCE, POINT OF VIEW, BUT</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:16.771" end="00:02:19.140">SHE DID NOT PUT THE WORDS ON THE PAPER.</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:19.140" end="00:02:21.543">AGAIN, NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:21.543" end="00:02:24.846">SO, IF I’M READING THIS CORRECTLY, MRS. CLINTON</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:24.846" end="00:02:29.551">MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON THE</p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:02:29.551" end="00:02:31.519">REPUBLICAN TICKET. SHE IS OBVIOUSLY WORRIED</p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:34.055">ABOUT TAXES. OBVIOUSLY A HARD WORKER.</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:02:34.055" end="00:02:37.559">AND SHE IS MAKING ROMNEY-TYPE MONEY IN THE</p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:02:37.559" end="00:02:39.861">FREE MARKETPLACE. IS SHE NOT?</p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:02:39.861" end="00:02:42.497">ALSO, SHE DOESN’T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT.</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:02:42.497" end="00:02:46.635">SHE IS A 1 PERCENTER. SHE HAS FAR MORE CASH THAN</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:02:46.635" end="00:02:49.604">MOST AMERICANS EVEN DREAM OF HAVING.</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:02:49.604" end="00:02:53.308">NOW, IF MRS. CLINTON DOES RUN AS A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT,</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:02:53.308" end="00:02:56.678">AND DOES START SPOUTING INCOME INEQUALITY, TALKING</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:02:56.678" end="00:03:01.216">POINTS WILL BE OFFENDED. IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:03:01.216" end="00:03:04.085">CAPITALISM IS DISTORTED, A BAD THING, BECAUSE IT</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:03:04.085" end="00:03:07.489">PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MILLIONS, THEN YOU</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:03:07.489" end="00:03:11.393">CAN’T BE VACUUMING UP THE MONEY.</p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:03:11.393" end="00:03:14.362">THAT WOULD BE HYPOCRITICAL. IF THE CLINTONS WANT TO GIVE</p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:03:14.362" end="00:03:16.131">THE MONEY TO CHARITY, THAT’S ANOTHER STORY.</p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:03:16.131" end="00:03:19.334">BUT AT THIS POINT, BILL AND HILLARY ARE LIVING VERY</p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:03:19.334" end="00:03:23.104">WELL. GIANT HOMES, PRIVATE JETS,</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:03:23.104" end="00:03:25.507">EVERY LUXURY. AGAIN, NOTHING WRONG WITH</p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:03:25.507" end="00:03:27.609">THAT. THEY EARNED IT.</p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="00:03:27.609" end="00:03:30.078">FINALLY, A PIECE OF ADVICE TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.</p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="00:03:30.078" end="00:03:34.549">IF HILLARY IS YOUR NOMINEE, STOW THE INCOME INEQUALITY</p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="00:03:34.549" end="00:03:37.652">STUFF. NOT GONNA PLAY WITH THE</p>
