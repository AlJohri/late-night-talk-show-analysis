   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:02:43.931" end="00:02:46.833">BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT’S TRUE. THEY KNOW WHAT I’M SAYING IS</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:02:46.833" end="00:02:50.037">TRUE. BUT, RATHER THAN TALK ABOUT</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:02:50.037" end="00:02:52.406">THAT, THEY WANT TO DIVERT THE ISSUE TO SOMETHING ELSE.</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:02:52.406" end="00:02:55.809">YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT OUR CONGRESS NEEDS</p>
