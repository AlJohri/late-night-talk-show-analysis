   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:11.502" end="00:01:13.404">HE IS ABOUT AS LEFT WING AS YOU GET.</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:13.404" end="00:01:15.239">BUT HE IS THE SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA.</p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:15.239" end="00:01:21.446">AND HE WAS ASKED BY THE ROCHESTER POST BULLETIN</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:21.446" end="00:01:25.282">NEWSPAPER IF HE SUPPORTED A BAN OF ASSAULT RIFLES.</p>

   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:01:34.158" end="00:01:38.262">SO, FRANKEN WON'T SAY WHETHER HE WANTS TO BAN ASSAULT RIFLES</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:38.262" end="00:01:42.700">BECAUSE IS HE FROM MINNESOTA, A STATE THAT'S NOT GOING TO</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:01:42.700" end="00:01:44.902">TAKE KINDLY TO THAT POINT OF VIEW.</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:01:44.902" end="00:01:46.871">THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF THESE DEMOCRATIC LIBERAL SENATORS</p>

   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:04.455" end="00:02:07.157">I DON'T THINK SENATOR FRANKEN HAS TAKEN ISSUE TO THAT AT</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:07.157" end="00:02:08.726">ALL. >> IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION.</p>
