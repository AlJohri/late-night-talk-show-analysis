   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:01:35.956" end="00:01:39.893">THE PRESIDENT WAS THROUGHOUT THE ATTACK I GOT HER TO SAY</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:01:39.893" end="00:01:44.497">AND THAT WAS GOOD, I DIDN’T KNOW THAT IN THERE, HE WAS</p>

   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:01:44.831" end="00:01:47.133">I DON’T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS. I WOULD HAVE SAID WHERE WERE</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:01:47.133" end="00:01:51.571">YOU, HOW COME YOU DIDN’T GET SHE IS ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:01:51.571" end="00:01:54.107">OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THROUGHOUT THE ATTACK SHE IS</p>

   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:00.947" end="00:02:02.782">IT’S HER TURF. ALL RIGHT, SECONDLY.</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:02.782" end="00:02:04.784">I WATCHED THE INTERVIEW. IT DIDN’T SEEM LIKE SHE HAD</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:04.784" end="00:02:08.822">A LOT OF GUILT ABOUT THIS. I MEAN, SHE DOESN’T THINK</p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:02:08.822" end="00:02:12.225">THAT SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR THIS ATTACK.</p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:02:12.225" end="00:02:13.660">MAYBE SHE WASN’T. ALL RIGHT.</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:02:13.660" end="00:02:16.930">I SAID IN THE PAST THAT SECRETARIES OF STATE THEY</p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:02:16.930" end="00:02:19.065">DON’T REALLY MICROMANAGE SECURITY.</p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:02:19.065" end="00:02:22.402">BUT SHE DOESN’T REALLY -- I DIDN’T SEE, GEE, I MERELY</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:02:22.402" end="00:02:25.872">MADE A MISTAKE AND I’M SORRY I SCREWED UP.</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:02:25.872" end="00:02:27.474">I DIDN’T SEE THAT. &gt;&gt; THERE IS ALSO THE FACT</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:02:27.474" end="00:02:30.277">THAT SHE STILL BELIEVES THE VIDEO PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:02:30.277" end="00:02:31.945">ROLE. THE ANTI-ISLAMIC VIDEO</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:02:31.945" end="00:02:34.948">PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN BENGHAZI, EVEN TODAY.</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:02:34.948" end="00:02:36.549">SHE SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS NEW.</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:02:36.549" end="00:02:36.550">THAT IS THE CAREENING OF</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:02:38.285" end="00:02:39.586">INTELLIGENCE. SHE THOUGHT IT WAS THE</p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:02:39.586" end="00:02:42.188">VIDEO. AND THEN SHE THOUGHT IT WAS</p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:02:42.188" end="00:02:43.356">COORDINATED TERRORIST ATTACK.</p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:02:43.356" end="00:02:46.059">WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET TO IN THIS KIND OF LAYING IT</p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:02:46.059" end="00:02:51.731">ALL OUT WAS THAT SHE PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE ON 9/11 2012</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:02:51.731" end="00:02:54.334">AT 10:07 P.M. IN WHICH SHE SAYS BENGHAZI</p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:02:54.334" end="00:02:58.538">IS THE RESULT OF THIS VIDEO THAT HAS BEEN PLAYED</p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="00:02:58.538" end="00:03:02.242">THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. AND SHE IS SAYING THAT THERE</p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="00:03:02.242" end="00:03:05.612">WAS ALL KINDS OF FOG OF WAR INTELLIGENCE HAPPENING AT</p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="00:03:05.612" end="00:03:07.180">THE TIME. THE OTHER THING, AS YOU</p>
   <p xml:id="74" begin="00:03:07.180" end="00:03:09.382">POINT OUT, IS THE RESPONSIBILITY.</p>
   <p xml:id="75" begin="00:03:09.382" end="00:03:12.352">LISTEN, THE ARB, THE ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW BOARD,</p>
   <p xml:id="76" begin="00:03:12.352" end="00:03:13.920">THEY DID NOT INTERVIEW HILLARY CLINTON.</p>
   <p xml:id="77" begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:16.890">THERE WERE FOUR PEOPLE NAMED, ONE OF THEM WAS</p>
   <p xml:id="78" begin="00:03:16.890" end="00:03:19.092">RETIRING. THREE OF THEM WERE</p>
   <p xml:id="79" begin="00:03:19.092" end="00:03:20.360">REASSIGNED. NO ONE GOT FIRED.</p>
   <p xml:id="80" begin="00:03:20.360" end="00:03:23.263">SO WHERE WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY AFTER ALL OF</p>
   <p xml:id="81" begin="00:03:23.263" end="00:03:24.431">THIS? &gt;&gt; THERE WASN’T ANY.</p>
   <p xml:id="82" begin="00:03:24.431" end="00:03:28.902">I THINK YOUR QUOTE WAS THAT PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES AND IT</p>
   <p xml:id="83" begin="00:03:28.902" end="00:03:31.371">WASN’T -- IT WAS AN HONEST THING OR WHATEVER.</p>
