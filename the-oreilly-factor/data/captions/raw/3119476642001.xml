   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:02:14.968" end="00:02:20.140">THE MEANS HE’S NOT THE  SCHMOOZER.</p>

   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:31.585" end="00:02:36.123">PUBLIC, YOU NEVER HEAR HIM GIVE  CREDIT TO THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE </p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:36.123" end="00:02:39.593">OF ANY ARGUMENT THAT IT AT LEAST IS RESPECTFUL OF THE COUNTRY AND</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:39.593" end="00:02:45.365">HAS A NATIONAL INTEREST IN MIND, ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE BASED ON </p>

   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:52.372" end="00:02:55.576">GOOD FAITH, BECAUSE YOU SAY YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE NOT STRONG.</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:55.576" end="00:02:57.711">THAT’S NOT OBAMA. OBAMA SAYS THE REPUBLICANS THINK</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:57.711" end="00:03:00.314">OF THE NEXT ELECTION, NOT THE  NEXT GENERATION.</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:03:00.314" end="00:03:04.151">OBAMA SAYS I THINK OF THE  NATIONAL INTEREST, AND THEY </p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:03:04.151" end="00:03:09.256">THINK ONLY OF THEIR OWN POWER  AND WHAT THEY CAN DO. </p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:03:09.256" end="00:03:12.860">&gt;&gt; IT’S MORE THAN THAT. IT’S MORE PERSONAL THAN THAT.</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:03:12.860" end="00:03:17.030">HIS AGO LIGHTS GO OUT, IT HAS TO BE WITH HIS APPROVAL AND SAY, </p>

   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:03:38.519" end="00:03:42.823">HOW IT WORKS. &gt;&gt; NO, THAT’S VERY TRUE.</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:03:42.823" end="00:03:46.493">IT WOULD MAKE IT HARD TO SADDLE  UP TO REPUBLICANS.</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:03:46.493" end="00:03:48.695">HE DOESN’T LIKE TO SADDLE UP TO  ANYONE. </p>
