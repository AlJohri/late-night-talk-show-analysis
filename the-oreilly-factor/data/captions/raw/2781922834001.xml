   <p xml:id="13" begin="00:00:23.624" end="00:00:27.695">BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM, THE MAIN PROBLEM IS PRESIDENT</p>
   <p xml:id="14" begin="00:00:27.695" end="00:00:30.197">OBAMA HIMSELF. FOR YEARS HE HAS BEEN SAYING</p>

   <p xml:id="21" begin="00:00:49.149" end="00:00:49.150">AFFORDABLE.</p>
   <p xml:id="22" begin="00:00:49.550" end="00:00:53.320">&gt;&gt; WELL, FOR MANY AMERICANS THAT’S SIMPLY NOT TRUE.</p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:00:53.320" end="00:00:56.991">THE INITIAL DATA IS CLEAR, HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:00:56.991" end="00:00:59.827">ARE GOING UP FOR MANY WORKING AMERICANS AND HEALTH</p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:00:59.827" end="00:01:03.497">INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY TOSSING PEOPLE OFF</p>

   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:10.871" end="00:01:12.673">YOU ADMIT THAT THE PRESIDENT SAID IF YOU YOU HAVE A PLAN</p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:12.673" end="00:01:15.109">YOU WILL GET TO KEEP IT THAT THAT WAS NOT TRUE.</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:15.109" end="00:01:17.678">&gt;&gt; LET’S JUST BE CLEAR. WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID AND</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:17.678" end="00:01:19.780">WHAT EVERYBODY SAID ALL ALONG IS THAT THERE ARE</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:01:19.780" end="00:01:23.450">GOING TO BE CHANGES BROUGHT ALONG BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE</p>

   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:25.619" end="00:01:28.022">IT’S TRUE THERE ARE EXISTING HEALTHCARE PLANS ON THE</p>

   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:01:41.135" end="00:01:44.705">PREVIOUS STATEMENTS. THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:01:44.705" end="00:01:48.709">DID THE PRESIDENT KNOWINGLY MISLEAD THE NATION?</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:01:48.709" end="00:01:51.912">&gt;&gt; OBAMA KNEW, EVEN AT THE TIME HE SAID IT THERE WAS NO</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:01:51.912" end="00:01:53.514">GUARANTEE EVERYBODY WAS GOING TO KEEP THEIR</p>

   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:01:56.150" end="00:01:57.818">&gt;&gt; SO HE KNEW HE WAS LYING WHEN HE LIED?</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:01:57.818" end="00:02:00.421">&gt;&gt; I’M SORRY? &gt;&gt; HE KNEW HE WAS LYING?</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:00.421" end="00:02:02.423">&gt;&gt; PROBABLY, PROBABLY. BUT THAT’S ONE OF THOSE</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:02.423" end="00:02:06.293">POLITICAL LIES, YOU KNOW. &gt;&gt; TALKING POINTS IS NOT</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:06.293" end="00:02:09.563">CONVINCED CLARENCE PAGE, A LIBERAL, IS CORRECT.</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:09.563" end="00:02:11.231">HERE IS WHAT I THINK</p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:02:11.231" end="00:02:11.232">HAPPENED.</p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:02:13.167" end="00:02:14.935">MR. OBAMA BROUGHT LITTLE CRITICAL THINKING TO THE</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:02:14.935" end="00:02:17.871">TABLE ON OBAMA CARE AND PRETTY MUCH TALKED HIMSELF</p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:02:17.871" end="00:02:19.707">INTO A SCENARIO THAT HE WANTED.</p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:02:19.707" end="00:02:23.043">THAT IS THAT GOVERNMENT CAN CONTROL THE AMERICAN HEALTH</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:02:23.043" end="00:02:24.945">INDUSTRY WITH LITTLE CONSUMER DOWNSIDE.</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:02:24.945" end="00:02:27.648">NOW, I’M NOT MAKING EXCUSES FOR THE PRESIDENT.</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:02:27.648" end="00:02:32.186">HIS VISION CLEARLY HAS HARMED MANY OF US.</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:02:32.186" end="00:02:36.757">AND HE WILL PAY A STEEP POLITICAL PRICE FOR THAT.</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:02:36.757" end="00:02:39.326">BUT AT THIS POINT I’M NOT WILLING TO SAY THAT HE</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:02:39.326" end="00:02:41.595">INTENTIONALLY LIED. THE EVIDENCE SAYS HE SIMPLY</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:02:41.595" end="00:02:45.499">DID NOT WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH NOR DID HE SEEK IT.</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:02:45.499" end="00:02:48.435">A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENCE THERE IT’S SUBTLE.</p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:02:48.435" end="00:02:52.206">AND NOW EVEN THE LIBERAL PRESS IS REPORTING</p>

   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:03:04.818" end="00:03:07.755">MORE BUT COST MORE AS WELL. &gt;&gt; THAT MILLIONS WILL LOSE</p>
