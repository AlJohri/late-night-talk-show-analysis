   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:01:32.626" end="00:01:35.996">&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. SO, HE STAYS TRUE TO HIS</p>

   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:01:37.230" end="00:01:39.099">AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT ATTACHES HIS LAND.</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:01:39.099" end="00:01:42.669">SO THAT WHEN HE DIES, OR ATTEMPTS TO SELL, THE</p>

   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:01:46.640" end="00:01:50.177">THE PERFECT RIGHT TO DO THAT THAT’S WHAT YOU DO TO TAX</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:01:50.177" end="00:01:52.045">SCOFFLAWS WHO DON’T PAY THEIR TAXES.</p>

   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:01:59.519" end="00:02:01.688">WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO.</p>

   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:02:49.503" end="00:02:51.204">I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION FROM THE PEOPLE ON THE</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:02:51.204" end="00:02:52.405">GROUND THERE. &gt;&gt; OKAY.</p>
