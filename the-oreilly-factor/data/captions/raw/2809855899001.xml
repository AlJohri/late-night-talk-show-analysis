   <p xml:id="5" begin="00:00:07.140" end="00:00:10.143">IT IS BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THE PRESIDENT AND</p>
   <p xml:id="6" begin="00:00:10.143" end="00:00:13.546">HIS ADMINISTRATION MISLEAD AMERICANS ABOUT OBAMACARE.</p>
   <p xml:id="7" begin="00:00:13.546" end="00:00:16.283">TALKING POINTS IS TIRED OF HEARING THE PRESIDENT’S PAST</p>
   <p xml:id="8" begin="00:00:16.283" end="00:00:18.251">STATEMENTS THAT WE’LL BE ALLOWED TO KEEP OUR HEALTH</p>
   <p xml:id="9" begin="00:00:18.251" end="00:00:20.654">INSURANCE PLANS, PERIOD. THAT’S NOT TRUE.</p>
   <p xml:id="10" begin="00:00:20.654" end="00:00:22.922">AND THE PRESIDENT SHOULD ADMIT IT RIGHT NOW.</p>
   <p xml:id="11" begin="00:00:22.922" end="00:00:25.425">BUT HE WON’T. INSTEAD, YESTERDAY, HE</p>

   <p xml:id="16" begin="00:00:40.874" end="00:00:42.042">PLAN. BUT IF THE INSURANCE COMPANY</p>
   <p xml:id="17" begin="00:00:42.042" end="00:00:45.478">CHANGES IT, THEN WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THEY HAVE GOT TO</p>
   <p xml:id="18" begin="00:00:45.478" end="00:00:47.414">CHANGE IT TO A HIGHER STANDARD.</p>
   <p xml:id="19" begin="00:00:47.414" end="00:00:49.316">THEY HAVE GOT TO MAKE IT BETTER.</p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:00:49.316" end="00:00:51.084">THEY HAVE GOT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE PLAN THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="21" begin="00:00:51.084" end="00:00:52.719">THEY ARE SELLING. THAT’S PART OF THE PROMISE</p>
   <p xml:id="22" begin="00:00:52.719" end="00:00:55.522">THAT WE MADE, TOO. THAT’S WHY WE WENT OUT OF</p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:00:55.522" end="00:00:59.392">OUR WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAW ALLOWED FOR</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:00:59.392" end="00:01:01.194">GRANDFATHERING. &gt;&gt; TALKING POINTS SUBMITS</p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:01:01.194" end="00:01:04.264">THERE IS NOT A GRANDFATHER IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WHO</p>
   <p xml:id="26" begin="00:01:04.264" end="00:01:07.033">KNOWS WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT.</p>
   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:07.033" end="00:01:10.603">THE TRUTH IS, INSURANCE COMPANIES CHANGE THEIR</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:10.603" end="00:01:13.773">POLICIES ALL THE TIME AND IF THOSE POLICY DOES NOT COMPLY</p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:13.773" end="00:01:15.809">WITH OBAMACARE, YOU CAN’T HAVE THEM, PERIOD.</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:15.809" end="00:01:18.411">AS THE PRESIDENT IS SO FOND OF SAYING.</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:18.411" end="00:01:21.348">AND HERE IS THE PROOF. IN 2010, MR. OBAMA SAID.</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:01:21.348" end="00:01:22.916">THIS. &gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, ANY INSURANCE</p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:01:22.916" end="00:01:25.752">THAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE WOULD BE GRANDFATHERED IN SO</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:25.752" end="00:01:30.223">YOU COULD KEEP. SO YOU COULD DECIDE NOT TO</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:01:30.223" end="00:01:35.061">GET IN THE EXCHANGE, THE BETTER PLAN, I COULD KEEP MY</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:01:35.061" end="00:01:38.965">ACME INSURANCE JUST TO HIGH DEDUCTIBLE CATASTROPHIC</p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:01:38.965" end="00:01:40.200">PLAN. I WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO</p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:44.437">GET THE BETTER ONE. &gt;&gt; NOT TRUE.</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:01:44.437" end="00:01:46.873">AGAIN, YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY DOES NOT COMPLY WITH</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:01:46.873" end="00:01:50.043">THE OBAMACARE MANDATE, YOU CAN’T KEEP IT FEW, IF ANY</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:01:50.043" end="00:01:53.246">INSURANCE PLANS STAY STATIC. THERE ARE ALWAYS CHANGES SO</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:01:53.246" end="00:01:55.548">THIS IS YET ANOTHER SLIGHT OF HAND.</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:01:55.548" end="00:01:59.119">PRESIDENT OBAMA IS MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE BY CONTINUING</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:01:59.119" end="00:02:01.654">TO PETTY FOG THE ISSUE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:01.654" end="00:02:04.324">GOING TO MICROMANAGE OBAMACARE AND THE PERCEPTION</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:04.324" end="00:02:06.726">NOW IS THE PRESIDENT DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH.</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:06.726" end="00:02:09.229">AND WHEN MEASURES, EVEN THOSE WHO FAVOR THE</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:09.229" end="00:02:11.030">DEMOCRATIC PARTY BELIEVE THEY ARE NOT BEING DEALT</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:11.030" end="00:02:14.768">WITH SQUARELY, THEY REACT. RECENT HISTORY PROVES THIS.</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:14.768" end="00:02:17.404">YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT PRESIDENT BUSH THE ELDER</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:17.404" end="00:02:21.074">RUNNING AGAINST MICHAEL DUKAKIS SAID THIS AT THE</p>

   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:02:55.241" end="00:03:01.614">AND I WILL SAY TO THEM READ MY LIPS.</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:03:01.614" end="00:03:05.084">NO NEW TAXES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:03:05.084" end="00:03:07.954">&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT TURNED OUT TO BE FALSE.  MR. BUSH RAISED</p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:03:07.954" end="00:03:12.258">TAXES IN 1990 TO THE TUNE OF $140 BILLION.</p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:03:12.258" end="00:03:14.727">HE EXPLAINED TO THE NATION HE HAD TO DO IT BECAUSE OF</p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:03:14.727" end="00:03:18.298">THE HUGE BUDGET DEFICIT. BY THE WAY THAT DEFICIT IS</p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:03:18.298" end="00:03:20.934">MINUSCULE COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAVE NOW.</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:03:20.934" end="00:03:23.403">ANYWAY IN 1992, PRESIDENT BUSH LOST THE ELECTION TO</p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:03:23.403" end="00:03:26.206">BILL CLINTON. IN FACT, MR. BUSH WAS</p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="00:03:26.206" end="00:03:28.641">HAMMERED LOSING THE POPULAR VOTE BY 6 MILLION.</p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="00:03:28.641" end="00:03:31.110">THE READ MY LIPS REMARK CERTAINLY HURT HIM.</p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="00:03:31.110" end="00:03:32.979">SO PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD TAKE NOTE THAT UNLIKE FAST</p>
   <p xml:id="74" begin="00:03:32.979" end="00:03:37.083">AND FURIOUS, BENGHAZI, THE IRS AND THE NSA SNOOPING,</p>
   <p xml:id="75" begin="00:03:37.083" end="00:03:39.052">OBAMACARE IS A FAR DIFFERENT DEAL.</p>
   <p xml:id="76" begin="00:03:39.052" end="00:03:41.554">AMERICANS ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTED, DIRECTLY AFFECTED.</p>
   <p xml:id="77" begin="00:03:41.554" end="00:03:43.823">THAT IS THEY ARE PAYING MORE MONEY FOR SOMETHING WHETHER</p>

   <p xml:id="79" begin="00:03:47.193" end="00:03:49.729">NOW, LET’S DEAL WITH THE L WORD CONTROVERSY.</p>
   <p xml:id="80" begin="00:03:49.729" end="00:03:52.031">TALKING POINTS DOES NOT BELIEVE PRESIDENT BUSH THE</p>
   <p xml:id="81" begin="00:03:52.031" end="00:03:54.767">ELDER LIED WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD NOT RAISE TAXES.</p>
   <p xml:id="82" begin="00:03:54.767" end="00:03:57.003">HE SINCERELY DID NOT THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN.</p>
   <p xml:id="83" begin="00:03:57.003" end="00:03:59.806">SO HE DID NOT ACTIVELY DECEIVE THE PUBLIC.</p>
   <p xml:id="84" begin="00:03:59.806" end="00:04:03.109">HOWEVER, HE DID FOLD AND VIOLATED HIS PROMISE.</p>
   <p xml:id="85" begin="00:04:03.109" end="00:04:05.645">AND PAID THE PRICE FOR THAT DECISION.</p>
   <p xml:id="86" begin="00:04:05.645" end="00:04:08.014">MOST AMERICANS ARE SMART ENOUGH TO DECIDE FOR</p>
   <p xml:id="87" begin="00:04:08.014" end="00:04:10.717">THEMSELVES WHETHER PRESIDENT OBAMA LIED ABOUT OBAMACARE.</p>
   <p xml:id="88" begin="00:04:10.717" end="00:04:13.019">MY PERSONAL BELIEF? IS THAT THE PRESIDENT NEVER</p>
   <p xml:id="89" begin="00:04:13.019" end="00:04:15.722">READ THE LAW, DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE LAW, AND DID</p>
   <p xml:id="90" begin="00:04:15.722" end="00:04:18.358">NOT CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE LAW.</p>
   <p xml:id="91" begin="00:04:18.358" end="00:04:21.027">THEREFORE, HE SAID WHAT HIS SPEECH WRITERS WROTE.</p>
   <p xml:id="92" begin="00:04:21.027" end="00:04:23.530">THAT WE COULD KEEP OUR HEALTH INSURANCE AND DOCTORS</p>
   <p xml:id="93" begin="00:04:23.530" end="00:04:25.164">IF WE WANT. THAT TURNS OUT TO BE FALSE</p>
   <p xml:id="94" begin="00:04:25.164" end="00:04:27.734">AND CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE</p>
   <p xml:id="95" begin="00:04:27.734" end="00:04:31.304">DECEPTION. NOW, PART OF MY ANALYSIS IS</p>
   <p xml:id="96" begin="00:04:31.304" end="00:04:34.841">SPECULATIVE. MAYBE MR. OBAMA DID READ THE</p>

   <p xml:id="98" begin="00:04:37.277" end="00:04:40.013">BECAUSE THAT’S NOT THE WAY HE ROLLS.</p>
   <p xml:id="99" begin="00:04:40.013" end="00:04:43.316">TO USE A CURRENT EXPRESSION. BUT IN THE END IT REALLY</p>

   <p xml:id="101" begin="00:04:46.653" end="00:04:48.755">OBAMACARE AT THIS POINT IS CHAOTIC AND MOST OF US WILL</p>
