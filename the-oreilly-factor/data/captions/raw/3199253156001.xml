   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:01:11.605" end="00:01:15.308">THAT OBAMACARE STILL CHAOTIC. IT’S STILL A MESS. </p>
   <p xml:id="26" begin="00:01:15.308" end="00:01:19.613">&gt;&gt; IT’S WORKING MUCH BETTER. THE SIGN-UP IS GOING TO BE </p>
   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:19.613" end="00:01:21.481">CLOSE. BUT BY THE WAY, IT’S GOING TO BE</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:21.481" end="00:01:25.018">WORKING MUCH BETTER IN 2016. SHE’S NOT GOING TO REPUDIATE -- </p>

   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:28.522" end="00:01:31.224">SHE’LL REPUDIATE -- THIS IS MY  THING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:31.224" end="00:01:35.262">I THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS A  VERY REALISTIC PERSON.</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:01:35.262" end="00:01:36.997">WOULD I BE WRONG IN THAT  ASSESSMENT?</p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:01:36.997" end="00:01:41.902">&gt;&gt; YOU WOULD NOT BE WRONG. SHE’S A PRETTY GROUNDED REALIST.</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:41.902" end="00:01:45.806">&gt;&gt; AND SHE MAKES DECISIONS BASED UPON WHAT’S BEST FOR HILLARY </p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:01:45.806" end="00:01:51.478">CLINTON AS MOST HUMAN BEINGS DO. MOST HUMAN BEINGS MAKE DECISIONS</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:01:51.478" end="00:01:54.648">ON WHAT’S BEST FOP THEMSELVES. SHE’S A DELEGATOR.</p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:01:54.648" end="00:01:56.750">WOE SAW THAT AS SECRETARY OF  STATE.</p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:01:56.750" end="00:01:58.985">SHE THROWS A LOT OF THINGS TO  PEOPLE SHE HIRES.</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:01:58.985" end="00:02:02.055">A LOT OF TIMES THAT DOESN’T WORK OUT, LIKE LIBYA, THAT’S A GOOD </p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:02:02.055" end="00:02:04.858">EXAMPLE OF THAT. BUT SHE’S NOT LIKE BARACK OBAMA </p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:02:04.858" end="00:02:08.495">WHO’S REALLY AN IDEOLOGICAL MAN, BARACK OBAMA, AND HIS WIFE IS </p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:02:08.495" end="00:02:12.265">TOO, MICHELLE OBAMA, WHO HAS A  LOT TO SAY BEHIND THE SCENES.</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:12.265" end="00:02:15.902">SO HERE’S MY NEXT QUESTION. I DON’T THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:15.902" end="00:02:17.938">THAT LIBERAL. I JUST DON’T.</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:17.938" end="00:02:22.476">I THINK SHE MOUTHS IT, BUT IN  HER HEART I THINK SHE’S JUST </p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:22.476" end="00:02:23.944">GOING TO DO ANYTHING SHE CAN TO  WIN.</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:23.944" end="00:02:27.347">IF THAT MEANS SAYING SHE LOVES  TO WATCH &quot;THE FACTOR&quot; THAT’S </p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:27.347" end="00:02:30.083">WHAT SHE’S GOING TO SAY.  &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I THINK IF YOU LOOK</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:30.083" end="00:02:32.652">AT HER HISTORY, FIRST OF ALL,  SHE’S PRETTY COMMITTED TO THE </p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:32.652" end="00:02:35.989">CHILDREN’S ISSUES. SHE WAS ON THE BOARD OF THE </p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:35.989" end="00:02:37.991">CHILDREN’S DEFENSE FUND. SHE’S CERTAINLY A LOT OF THINGS </p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:02:37.991" end="00:02:40.927">BUT SHE’S NOT IN TERMS OF  FOREIGN POLICY AS SECRETARY OF </p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:02:40.927" end="00:02:45.866">STATE -- SHE’S NOT -- SHE’S  NOT -- SHE CERTAINLY BELIEVES IN</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:02:45.866" end="00:02:50.237">SOME INTERVENTIONS AND SHE  BELIEVES IN MUSCULAR FOREIGN </p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:02:50.237" end="00:02:52.072">POLICY. LOOK AT HEALTH CARE.</p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:02:52.072" end="00:02:55.442">WHEN SHE WAS FIRST LADY, SHE WAS VERY INVOLVED IN TRYING TO PASS </p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:02:55.442" end="00:02:59.112">A HEALTH CARE ACT. SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT, BUT </p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:02:59.112" end="00:03:00.981">CERTAINLY TRYING TO INSURE  EVERYBODY.</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:03:00.981" end="00:03:02.883">I THINK SHE’S PRETTY  OPEN-MINDED.</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:03:02.883" end="00:03:07.687">BUT YOU’RE RIGHT, SHE IS A  REALIST AND SHE’S GROUNDED IN </p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:03:07.687" end="00:03:09.956">PRAGMATISM. BUT I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE </p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:03:09.956" end="00:03:12.726">THINGS THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE  GOALS SHE HAS WOULD BE SIMILAR </p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:03:12.726" end="00:03:14.294">TO SOME OF THE GOALS THAT THE  PRESIDENT HAS. </p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:03:14.294" end="00:03:18.231">&gt;&gt; I DON’T THINK SO. I THINK THEY’RE GOING TO LET </p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:03:18.231" end="00:03:20.467">BILL CLINTON RUN THE ECONOMY. IF HILLARY CLINTON RUNS FOR </p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:03:20.467" end="00:03:23.303">PRESIDENT, I THINK SHE’S GOING  TO OUTRIGHT SAY I’M GOING TO PUT</p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:03:23.303" end="00:03:25.739">MY HUSBAND IN CHARGE OF THE  ECONOMY, BECAUSE UNDER HIM IT </p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:03:25.739" end="00:03:28.842">WAS PRETTY GOOD. AND SO HE KNOWS HOW TO DO IT.</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:03:28.842" end="00:03:33.513">I THINK THAT’S WHAT --  &gt;&gt; I’M PRETTY SURE IF SHE’S </p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:03:33.513" end="00:03:35.315">ELECTED SHE’S GOING TO BE HER  OWN PERSON.</p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="00:03:35.315" end="00:03:37.584">I THINK SHE’LL STAY IN CHARGE.  &gt;&gt; YOU DON’T THINK BILL WILL BE </p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="00:03:37.584" end="00:03:39.352">IN CHARGE OF STUFF? COME ON. </p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="00:03:39.352" end="00:03:41.788">&gt;&gt; NO, I DON’T. &gt;&gt; COME ON. </p>
   <p xml:id="74" begin="00:03:41.788" end="00:03:44.591">&gt;&gt; SHE’S A PRETTY STRONG PERSON  AND I THINK IF SHE GOES TO THE </p>

   <p xml:id="76" begin="00:03:46.960" end="00:03:51.965">&gt;&gt; SO WHAT YOU’RE SAYING IS BILL CLINTON IS IF HILLARY IS </p>
   <p xml:id="77" begin="00:03:51.965" end="00:03:54.467">ELECTED, HE’S GOING TO THE  MOVIES AND BOWLING EVERY DAY. </p>
   <p xml:id="78" begin="00:03:54.467" end="00:03:56.703">&gt;&gt; THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M SAYING.  &gt;&gt; THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID.</p>
   <p xml:id="79" begin="00:03:56.703" end="00:03:59.806">&gt;&gt; NO, I DON’T THINK SHE’S GOING PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF ANYTHING, </p>
   <p xml:id="80" begin="00:03:59.806" end="00:04:04.644">BUT CERTAINLY HIS COUNSEL WOULD  BE SOMETHING VALUABLE BUT I </p>
   <p xml:id="81" begin="00:04:04.644" end="00:04:07.948">THINK SHE’S PRETTY MUCH IF SHE  GOES TO THE TROUBLE OF GETTING </p>
   <p xml:id="82" begin="00:04:07.948" end="00:04:09.783">ELECTED, I THINK SHE’LL RUN THE  COUNTRY HERSELF. </p>
   <p xml:id="83" begin="00:04:09.783" end="00:04:13.453">&gt;&gt; THIS LIBERAL WOMAN OVER AT  MSNBC SAID THAT HILLARY CAN’T BE</p>
