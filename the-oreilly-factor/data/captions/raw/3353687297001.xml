   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:02:01.355" end="00:02:03.123">NEGOTIATIONS WILL SOLVE ALL THE WORLD’S PROBLEMS.</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:02:03.123" end="00:02:09.329">I MEAN, VLADIMIR PUTIN IS PLAYING GAMES AND WE ARE</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:02:09.329" end="00:02:18.105">PLAYING DO DOWNTON ABBEY. A GIFT TO RUSSIA WOULD GET</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:02:18.105" end="00:02:20.273">PUTIN’S ATTENTION. PUTIN’S MILITARY IS REALLY</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:20.273" end="00:02:22.743">HOLLOW AND THEY HAVE REAL FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:22.743" end="00:02:24.945">THE THIRD THING AND WE COULD DO THIS, YOU KNOW,</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:24.945" end="00:02:27.581">UNILATERALLY IF WE HAD TO. I WANT EUROPE ON BOARD.</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:27.581" end="00:02:29.916">THEY ARE TIMID AND AFRAID OF USING MONEY.</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:29.916" end="00:02:31.685">BROAD, DEEP SANCTIONS THAT REALLY BITE.</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:31.685" end="00:02:36.923">BECAUSE PUTIN’S LONG TERM -- I STRESS LONG TERM ACHILLES</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:36.923" end="00:02:42.896">HEEL IS THAT HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS.</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:42.896" end="00:02:44.364">&gt;&gt; SURE. HAVE YOU GOT TO CONVINCE HIM</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:44.364" end="00:02:47.134">AS I SAID AND IT’S NOT EASY TO DO THAT IF THE UNITED</p>

   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:02:58.979" end="00:03:01.648">THAT’S WHY HE HAS GOT THE TRIEWPS THERE.</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:03:01.648" end="00:03:03.650">SO I DIDN’T BELIEVE THAT PUTIN IS GOING TO INVADE.</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:03:03.650" end="00:03:06.253">I THINK PUTIN WOULD ONLY DO THAT IF WE DO SOMETHING LIKE</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:03:06.253" end="00:03:09.256">PUT THE MISSILES BACK. DID YOU FACTOR IN THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:03:09.256" end="00:03:12.759">EQUATION? SO, IT’S ALL UNINTENDED</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:03:12.759" end="00:03:14.928">CONSEQUENCES. SO IF OBAMA SAYS WE ARE</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:03:14.928" end="00:03:18.231">PUTTING THE MISSILES BACK, BANG, EASTERN UKRAINE IS</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:03:18.231" end="00:03:19.232">GONE. YOU KNOW THEY ARE NOT GOING</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:03:19.232" end="00:03:20.901">TO USE MILITARY ACTION AGAINST PUTIN.</p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:03:20.901" end="00:03:24.071">THAT’S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO PUTIN IS JUST SAYING</p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:03:24.071" end="00:03:26.573">ANYTHING YOU DO TO US WE ARE GOING TO TAKE MORE TERRITORY</p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:03:26.573" end="00:03:29.042">AND MORE TERRITORY. SO THEY ARE AFRAID.</p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:03:29.042" end="00:03:31.511">&gt;&gt; WELL, THEY ARE VERY AFRAID.</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:03:31.511" end="00:03:33.380">BUT FEAR IS NOT A WISE STRATEGY.</p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:03:33.380" end="00:03:35.115">IT’S NOT AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY.</p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="00:03:35.115" end="00:03:36.650">BILL, I THINK YOU ARE WRONG ABOUT SOMETHING.</p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="00:03:36.650" end="00:03:39.319">IT’S NOT THAT PUTIN IS GOING TO MOVE INTO EASTERN UKRAINE</p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="00:03:39.319" end="00:03:44.291">OR OTHER PARTS OF UKRAINE IF WE DO X, Y, OR Z.</p>
   <p xml:id="74" begin="00:03:44.291" end="00:03:48.862">HE IS GONNA GO FOR EASTERN UKRAINE AND SOUTHEASTERN</p>
