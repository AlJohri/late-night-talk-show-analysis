   <p xml:id="15" begin="00:00:37.804" end="00:00:41.875">FOR ME? &gt;&gt; WELL, I HAVE SOME IDEAS</p>
   <p xml:id="16" begin="00:00:41.875" end="00:00:44.878">ABOUT IT. FIRST OF ALL, I SERVED IN</p>
   <p xml:id="17" begin="00:00:44.878" end="00:00:49.849">THE NAVY IN THE 1960 AND IF YOU ARE CAPTURED, NO MATTER</p>
   <p xml:id="18" begin="00:00:49.849" end="00:00:49.850">WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE,</p>

   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:00:56.957" end="00:01:00.727">IS A VERY GOOD THING. I WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO</p>
   <p xml:id="21" begin="00:01:00.727" end="00:01:15.008">CRITICIZE THIS EXCEPT FROM A MANAGEMENT POINT OF VIEW.</p>
   <p xml:id="22" begin="00:01:15.008" end="00:01:17.777">WHAT HAPPENED IS GEE, WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET</p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:01:17.777" end="00:01:20.280">SOMEBODY RELEASED AND THEN THEY FAILED TO MANAGE IT.</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:24.217">A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, THE</p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:01:24.217" end="00:01:26.586">DEMOCRATIC CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE</p>

   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:29.756" end="00:01:33.326">SHE GOT A LATE CALL FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT THIS.</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:33.326" end="00:01:36.329">AND THEN SHE SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY KIND OF GO OUT ON</p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:40.734">THEIR OWN AND DO THINGS. AND I THINK THAT SUMMARIZES</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:40.734" end="00:01:44.237">WHAT HAPPENS HERE. THEY SHOULD SIT DOWN.</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:44.237" end="00:01:45.572">THEY SHOULD SOUND PEOPLE OUT.</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:01:45.572" end="00:01:50.176">THEY SHOULD TALK TO HER, THEY SHOULD TALK TO</p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:01:50.176" end="00:01:52.078">REPUBLICANS. IT’S A WELL-KNOWN FACT THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:52.078" end="00:01:55.949">JOHN MCCAIN WAS A POW FOR YEARS.</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:01:55.949" end="00:01:58.618">THE PRESIDENT COULD CALL HIM AND SAY LOOK, I’M THINKING</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:01:58.618" end="00:02:00.287">OF DOING. THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK --</p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:02:00.287" end="00:02:06.192">WHAT ARE THE DOWNSIDES WHEN YOU DO THAT KIND OF</p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:02:06.192" end="00:02:09.829">INTERROGATION, PARTICULARLY OF THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION,</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:02:09.829" end="00:02:14.301">THEN YOU MAY SAY WELL, LET’S COUNT TO IT 10 BEFORE WE DO</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:02:14.301" end="00:02:16.670">THIS OR LET’S DO THIS IN A DIFFERENT WAY.</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:02:16.670" end="00:02:20.874">AND SO, YOU SEE THAT THERE IS THAT UNFORTUNATE BUBBLE</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:02:20.874" end="00:02:28.248">IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE THEY THEY ARE TOUR OFTEN</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:28.248" end="00:02:29.582">ISOLATED ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS.</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:29.582" end="00:02:32.419">FOR INSTANCE, SUPPOSE SOMEBODY IN THE NATIONAL</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:32.419" end="00:02:35.588">SECURITY COUNSEL CALLED YOU, BILL, AND SAID IN</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:35.588" end="00:02:39.893">CONFIDENCE, WE’RE THINKING OF DOING THIS WHAT DO YOU</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:39.893" end="00:02:40.827">THINK? YOU WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOUR</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:40.827" end="00:02:42.829">POINT OF VIEW. &gt;&gt; I WOULD HAVE SAID DON’T</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:42.829" end="00:02:45.365">DO IT AS I SAID LAST NIGHT. I THINK YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:45.365" end="00:02:47.667">RIGHT THAT IT’S A MANAGEMENT PROBLEM.</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:47.667" end="00:02:50.704">HOWEVER, IT’S BEEN GOING ON ALMOST SIX YEARS IS IT</p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:02:50.704" end="00:02:57.110">ARROGANCE OR IGNORANCE? IT’S NOT SIMPLE.</p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:02:57.110" end="00:02:59.913">I HAVE DONE TWO BOOKS ON OBAMA AND GOT TO KNOW HIM IN</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:02:59.913" end="00:03:00.980">THE OPERATION AND I KNOW YOU</p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:03:00.980" end="00:03:00.981">WON’T LIKE TO HEAR THIS.</p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:03:02.082" end="00:03:03.683">I THINK THERE ARE SOME STRENGTHS THERE.</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:03:03.683" end="00:03:05.919">I THINK THERE. &gt;&gt; WHY WOULDN’T I WANT TO</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:03:05.919" end="00:03:08.088">HEAR THAT? I WANT TO HEAR THE HONEST</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:03:08.088" end="00:03:10.390">STORY. LOOK, BOB, IT’S GOT TO BE</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:03:10.390" end="00:03:13.460">ONE OF TWO THINGS. ARROGANCE OR IGNORANCE.</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:03:13.460" end="00:03:16.129">BECAUSE THIS IS NOW WHIPPING BACK ON THE PRESIDENT.</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:03:16.129" end="00:03:17.864">IT’S HITTING HIM RIGHT IN THE FOREHEAD.</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:03:17.864" end="00:03:20.033">AND IS HE GOING TO TAKE A TREMENDOUS HIT.</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:03:20.033" end="00:03:22.202">HE HIMSELF IS GOING TO TAKE THIS HIT.</p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:03:22.202" end="00:03:24.637">SO IS IT ARROGANCE OR IGNORANCE?</p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:03:24.637" end="00:03:29.609">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT’S ISOLATION. I THINK IT IS OH,x÷█ GEE, THIS</p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:03:29.609" end="00:03:34.280">IS HUMANITARIAN GESTURE, LET’S DO IT, AND NO ONE SITS</p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:03:34.280" end="00:03:37.784">AND THINKS IT THROUGH AND AS YOU WELL HE KNOW, WHEN YOU</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:03:37.784" end="00:03:40.353">DO SOMETHING LIKE, THIS YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN AND SAY,</p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:03:40.353" end="00:03:43.757">WHAT’S THE SECOND BOUNCE, THE THIRD BOUNCE, THE FOURTH</p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="00:03:43.757" end="00:03:45.859">BOUNCE? WHAT ARE PEOPLE GOING TO</p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="00:03:45.859" end="00:03:46.993">THINK? WHAT ARE THE ARGUMENTS</p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="00:03:46.993" end="00:03:50.029">AGAINST IT? HOW ARE WE GOING TO EXPLAIN</p>
   <p xml:id="74" begin="00:03:50.029" end="00:03:50.030">IT?</p>
   <p xml:id="75" begin="00:03:51.097" end="00:03:56.636">AND THEY JUST RUSH TO ACT ON SOMETIMES LIKE IN THIS CASE,</p>
   <p xml:id="76" begin="00:03:56.636" end="00:04:02.008">I THINK IT IS A GIN WYNN HUMANITARIAN IMPULSE.</p>
   <p xml:id="77" begin="00:04:02.008" end="00:04:04.177">BUT IT DOESN’T WORK. AND SO NOW --</p>
