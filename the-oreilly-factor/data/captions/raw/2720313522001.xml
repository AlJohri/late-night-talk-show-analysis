   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:01:35.362" end="00:01:37.698">CERTAINLY SOME FATAL FLAWS IN THE STRATEGY.</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:01:37.698" end="00:01:40.167">FIRST AND FOREMOST, YOU HAVE TO PASS A BILL TO</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:01:40.167" end="00:01:41.902">DEFUND OBAMA CARE. IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU</p>

   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:01:52.346" end="00:01:54.147">BY THE WAY, EVEN IF YOU PASS IT THROUGH THE SENATE,</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:01:54.147" end="00:01:56.383">PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GOING TO HAVE TO SIGN IT IF HE</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:01:56.383" end="00:01:59.453">DOESN’T SIGN IT THEN WE HAVE TO OVERRIDE HIS VETO.</p>

   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:02:24.578" end="00:02:28.281">BUT, SENATOR’S POINT OF VIEW IS I HAVE TO STAND ON</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:02:28.281" end="00:02:31.651">PRINCIPLE. I WAS ELECTED TO OPPOSE</p>

   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:02:37.190" end="00:02:39.760">SO I’M GOING TO CONTINUE ON THIS LINE EVEN IF I DON’T</p>
