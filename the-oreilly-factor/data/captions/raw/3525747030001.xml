   <p xml:id="3" begin="00:00:12.574" end="00:00:13.841">&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT STERLING HAS A PROBLEM.</p>
   <p xml:id="4" begin="00:00:13.841" end="00:00:19.147">BUT HERE IS THE HEADLINE:  IT’S PRIMARILY HIS PROBLEM,</p>
   <p xml:id="5" begin="00:00:19.147" end="00:00:24.452">NOT THE COUNTRY’S PROBLEM. HE IS SHAMEFUL, BUT DOES NOT</p>
   <p xml:id="6" begin="00:00:24.452" end="00:00:27.555">REPRESENT ANYONE OTHER THAN HIMSELF.</p>

   <p xml:id="8" begin="00:00:30.124" end="00:00:33.428">HALL OF FAMER KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR.</p>
   <p xml:id="9" begin="00:00:33.428" end="00:00:35.930">SO, THE STORY PRETTY MUCH IS GOING TO DIE THIS WEEK WITH</p>
   <p xml:id="10" begin="00:00:35.930" end="00:00:40.602">THIS PINHEAD, BUT DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE IS MORE TO</p>
   <p xml:id="11" begin="00:00:40.602" end="00:00:46.207">IT THAN JUST STERLING? &gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK WHAT THIS</p>
   <p xml:id="12" begin="00:00:46.207" end="00:00:49.978">ISSUE IS ALL ABOUT, ESPECIALLY FOR PROFESSIONAL</p>
   <p xml:id="13" begin="00:00:49.978" end="00:00:52.814">BASKETBALL IS THAT WE DON’T WANT MR. STERLING’S FACE TO</p>
   <p xml:id="14" begin="00:00:52.814" end="00:00:58.019">BE THE FACE OF THE NBA. THE NBA FEELS THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="15" begin="00:00:58.019" end="00:01:01.689">INTOLERANCE HAS NO PLACE IN WHAT IT IS TRYING TO DO AND</p>
   <p xml:id="16" begin="00:01:01.689" end="00:01:04.692">FOR THAT REASON THEY CAME DOWN HARD ON MR. STERLING.</p>
   <p xml:id="17" begin="00:01:04.692" end="00:01:06.494">&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. IS THAT ALTHOUGH?</p>
   <p xml:id="18" begin="00:01:06.494" end="00:01:10.865">DOES THIS HAVE ANY SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS FOR YOU?</p>
   <p xml:id="19" begin="00:01:10.865" end="00:01:14.002">&gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK HERE IN LOS ANGELES IT HAS SOCIETAL</p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:01:14.002" end="00:01:17.171">IMPLICATIONS BECAUSE MR. STERLING, FOR EXAMPLE,</p>
   <p xml:id="21" begin="00:01:17.171" end="00:01:20.108">DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BLACK AND HISPANICS TRYING TO RENT</p>
   <p xml:id="22" begin="00:01:20.108" end="00:01:23.978">SOME OF HIS PROPERTIES, PEOPLE WHO WERE QUALIFIED.</p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:01:23.978" end="00:01:26.214">THE ONLY THING FOR HIM THAT DIDN’T QUALIFY THEM WERE THE</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:01:26.214" end="00:01:29.350">COLOR OF THEIR SKIN OR THEIR NATIONALITY.</p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:01:29.350" end="00:01:31.319">&gt;&gt; NOW YOU WORKED FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; THAT REALLY STINKS.</p>
   <p xml:id="26" begin="00:01:31.319" end="00:01:33.521">&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. AND HE HAD TO PAY A BIG FINE</p>
   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:33.521" end="00:01:35.256">BECAUSE OF IT. YOU WORKED FOR HIM.</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:35.256" end="00:01:36.991">&gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW HE WAS A MAN</p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:36.991" end="00:01:39.294">OF THIS CALIBER WHEN YOU WERE WORKING FOR HIM?</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:39.294" end="00:01:41.796">&gt;&gt; NO, I DIDN’T. HE WAS VERY CONGENIAL.</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:41.796" end="00:01:45.300">HE INVITED ME TO HIS DAUGHTER’S WEDDING.</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:01:45.300" end="00:01:47.568">OKAY? HIS WIFE IS A VERY NICE</p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:01:47.568" end="00:01:51.973">LADY, YOU KNOW, IT’S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHO FEELS THIS</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:51.973" end="00:01:55.777">WAY BECAUSE NO ONE WEARS THE SIGN ON THEIR FOREHEAD THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:01:55.777" end="00:01:57.378">SAYS RACIST. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:01:57.378" end="00:01:59.480">SO YOU DIDN’T HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN YOU WERE WORKING FOR</p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:01:59.480" end="00:02:01.115">HIM THAT HE WAS -- &gt;&gt; .</p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:02:01.115" end="00:02:03.818">NO. &gt;&gt; HE HAD THESE KINDS OF</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:02:03.818" end="00:02:07.088">THOUGHTS. YOU KNOW, WILLIAM --</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:02:07.088" end="00:02:08.189">SPORTSWRITER FOR THE &quot;NEW YORK TIMES.&quot;</p>

   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:02:10.358" end="00:02:12.960">&gt;&gt; I KNOW BILL VERY WELL, YES.</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:12.960" end="00:02:13.594">&gt;&gt; OKAY. GOOD.</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:13.594" end="00:02:16.497">HE SAYS TODAY THAT BLACK PLAYERS IN THE NBA SHOULD</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:16.497" end="00:02:19.901">STOP CALLING EACH OTHER THE &quot;N&quot; WORD, THAT THAT IN</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:19.901" end="00:02:23.571">ITSELF IS DEMEANING AND HAS NO PLACE IN THE LEAGUE.</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:23.571" end="00:02:26.908">WHAT DO YOU SAY? &gt;&gt; I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:26.908" end="00:02:29.544">WITH THAT. PEOPLE WHO DON’T UNDERSTAND</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:29.544" end="00:02:33.381">WHAT WE FOUGHT FOR IN THIS COUNTRY DURING THE CIVIL</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:33.381" end="00:02:36.351">RIGHTS MOVEMENT THINK THAT THEY CAN CLEAN THAT WORD UP.</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:36.351" end="00:02:38.686">I DON’T THINK IT CAN EVER BE CLEANED UP.</p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:02:38.686" end="00:02:42.590">I THINK THAT BLACK AMERICANS SHOULD AVOID USING IT IN THE</p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:02:42.590" end="00:02:44.158">CONTEXT, ESPECIALLY WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO.</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:02:44.158" end="00:02:48.396">&gt;&gt; OKAY. YOU KNOW, YOU AND I ARE</p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:02:48.396" end="00:02:51.332">ALMOST THE SAME AGE AND I’M SURE YOU LOOK A LOT YOUNGER</p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:02:51.332" end="00:02:55.770">THAN I DO. I REMEMBER YOU AT POWER</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:02:55.770" end="00:03:00.108">MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU WERE A FANTASTIC HIGH SCHOOL</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:03:00.108" end="00:03:01.275">MARCH PLAYER. &gt;&gt; OKAY.</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:03:01.275" end="00:03:04.178">&gt;&gt; I WANT TO ASK YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION.</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:03:04.178" end="00:03:07.315">DO YOU FEEL AMERICA HAS TREATED YOU FAIRLY, YOU AND</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:03:07.315" end="00:03:11.352">YOUR FAMILY? &gt;&gt; FOR THE MOST PART.</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:03:11.352" end="00:03:14.422">YOU KNOW, MR. THERE IS PLUSES AND MINE NEWSES,</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:03:14.422" end="00:03:16.491">BEING A BLACK AMERICAN, SOMETIMES MEANS THAT YOU</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:03:16.491" end="00:03:19.026">HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOME THINGS THAT YOU SHOULDN’T.</p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:03:19.026" end="00:03:21.496">BUT I DON’T THINK THERE IS ANY ETHNIC GROUP IN THIS</p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:03:21.496" end="00:03:24.499">COUNTRY THAT HASN’T HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCE.</p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:03:24.499" end="00:03:28.636">IT’S JUST THAT ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE SLAVE TRADE</p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:03:28.636" end="00:03:31.873">MADE IT DIFFERENT FOR PEOPLE FROM AFRICA.</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:03:31.873" end="00:03:33.641">&gt;&gt; DO YOU RESPECT YOUR COUNTRY?</p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:03:33.641" end="00:03:35.176">DO YOU LOVE YOUR COUNTRY? &gt;&gt; YES.</p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="00:03:35.176" end="00:03:37.945">I FEEL PATRIOTIC. THIS IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY</p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="00:03:37.945" end="00:03:41.916">IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE HAVE THE ABILITY HERE TO MAKE IT</p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="00:03:41.916" end="00:03:43.451">BETTER. AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING</p>
   <p xml:id="74" begin="00:03:43.451" end="00:03:46.621">TO DO THAT. AND I THINK THAT SETS US</p>
   <p xml:id="75" begin="00:03:46.621" end="00:03:50.324">APART AND I THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUALLY REMEMBER THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="76" begin="00:03:50.324" end="00:03:52.627">WHEN WE TRY TO GET THINGS DONE.</p>
   <p xml:id="77" begin="00:03:52.627" end="00:03:58.866">&gt;&gt; YOU CAN FORGIVE STERLING? &gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
   <p xml:id="78" begin="00:03:58.866" end="00:04:02.837">BUT HE HASN’T ASKED FOR ANY FORGIVENESS.</p>
   <p xml:id="79" begin="00:04:02.837" end="00:04:05.239">HE SEEMS PRETTY SECURE IN HIS ATTITUDE AND, AGAIN,</p>
   <p xml:id="80" begin="00:04:05.239" end="00:04:10.645">THAT’S PART OF THE PROBLEM. MR. JABAR, WE THANK YOU FOR</p>
   <p xml:id="81" begin="00:04:10.645" end="00:04:12.146">COMING ON TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>
