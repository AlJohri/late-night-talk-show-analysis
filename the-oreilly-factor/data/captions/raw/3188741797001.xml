   <p xml:id="19" begin="00:00:53.353" end="00:00:55.121">MANY AMERICAN WORKERS WOULD HAVE FREEDOM.</p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:00:55.121" end="00:00:57.791">NOW, THAT’S A GOOD WORD. FREEDOM TO DO THINGS THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="21" begin="00:00:57.791" end="00:01:00.060">THEY COULDN’T DO. THE SINGLE MOM WHO IS</p>

   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:20.746" end="00:01:23.649">&gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU AND I, WORKING AMERICANS,</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:23.649" end="00:01:27.286">WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT PASSION.</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:27.286" end="00:01:30.289">SO THE SIMPLE QUESTION BECOMES IS THAT FAIR?</p>

   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:01:37.362" end="00:01:41.099">BUT NOW I’M BEING ASKED TO PAY FOR SOMEBODY’S PASSION</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:01:41.099" end="00:01:44.636">BY SUPPORTING THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE.</p>

   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:01:50.142" end="00:01:56.682">AND IT WAS HARD, HOT WORK IN THE SUMMER I I DID IT</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:01:56.682" end="00:01:58.684">BECAUSE I NEEDED MONEY FOR COLLEGE.</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:01:58.684" end="00:02:00.218">I WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT COLLEGE BECAUSE I PLAYED</p>

   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:10.462" end="00:02:13.231">SO THOUGHT DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN AMERICA HAS LOST THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:13.231" end="00:02:15.500">MESSAGE BECAUSE ITS VISION IS NOW ONE OF SUPPORTING</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:15.500" end="00:02:18.370">PEOPLE RATHER THAN PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOLKS TO</p>
