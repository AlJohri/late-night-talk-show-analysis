   <p xml:id="2" begin="00:00:09.331" end="00:00:10.499">WILL EFFECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>
   <p xml:id="3" begin="00:00:10.499" end="00:00:12.768">JOINING US FROM NEW YORK CO-HOST OF THE FIVE ANDREA</p>
   <p xml:id="4" begin="00:00:12.768" end="00:00:14.936">TANTAROS. SO I’M VERY INTERESTED, AS I</p>
   <p xml:id="5" begin="00:00:14.936" end="00:00:17.406">ASKED COLMES, ON THE WHY OF THE STORY.</p>
   <p xml:id="6" begin="00:00:17.406" end="00:00:19.474">OKAY? SO WE HAVE THE HARD RIGHT.</p>
   <p xml:id="7" begin="00:00:19.474" end="00:00:22.844">AND I DON’T KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE IN THAT CREW OR NOT.</p>
   <p xml:id="8" begin="00:00:22.844" end="00:00:27.082">BUT YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE HARD RIGHT.</p>
   <p xml:id="9" begin="00:00:27.082" end="00:00:31.453">THEIR THESIS, HIP CYST IS THAT BARACK OBAMA</p>
   <p xml:id="10" begin="00:00:31.453" end="00:00:33.155">INTENTIONALLY SUBVERTING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</p>
   <p xml:id="11" begin="00:00:33.155" end="00:00:37.025">HE WANTS TO RUIN A COUNTRY AS WE KNOW IT AND BUILD UP A</p>
   <p xml:id="12" begin="00:00:37.025" end="00:00:39.594">NEW COUNTRY. THAT’S THE HARD RIGHT’S</p>
   <p xml:id="13" begin="00:00:39.594" end="00:00:43.632">PLAY. IT DOESN’T DO HIM ANY GOOD</p>
   <p xml:id="14" begin="00:00:43.632" end="00:00:47.402">TO GET EMBARRASSED BY THE V.A. IN PURSUIT OF THAT IF</p>
   <p xml:id="15" begin="00:00:47.402" end="00:00:49.204">YOU BUY IT IT. THE V.A. SCANDAL THAT COMES</p>
   <p xml:id="16" begin="00:00:49.204" end="00:00:52.708">OUT OF BENGHAZI, COMES OUT OF THE IRS, COMES OUT OF</p>
   <p xml:id="17" begin="00:00:52.708" end="00:00:55.944">OBAMACARE AND INTO A WHOLE DIFFERENT CATEGORY, SO WHY</p>
   <p xml:id="18" begin="00:00:55.944" end="00:00:58.747">DO YOU THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT DIDN’T PAY</p>
   <p xml:id="19" begin="00:00:58.747" end="00:01:01.817">ATTENTION TO AN ISSUE THAT HE MADE A BIG DEAL OUT OF</p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:01:01.817" end="00:01:05.787">BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED. &gt;&gt; WELL, FIRST OF ALL, BILL,</p>
   <p xml:id="21" begin="00:01:05.787" end="00:01:08.757">I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS PROVEN TO BE PRETTY</p>
   <p xml:id="22" begin="00:01:08.757" end="00:01:10.258">DISENGAGED ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT I.</p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:01:10.258" end="00:01:14.196">THE REASON THAT I BELIEVE IS HE NOT AS ENGAGED IN THIS</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:01:14.196" end="00:01:17.766">ONE, ESPECIALLY NOW, EVEN THOUGH IT’S GRACING MOST</p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:01:17.766" end="00:01:20.535">NEWSPAPERS AND COVERING, YOU KNOW, THE BIG STORY ON CABLE</p>
   <p xml:id="26" begin="00:01:20.535" end="00:01:26.475">NEWS IS BECAUSE IF HE ADDRESSES THIS, BILL, THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:26.475" end="00:01:29.144">MAKES HIM DEFENSIVE ON SIGNATURE ISSUE, WHICH IS</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:29.144" end="00:01:30.679">HEALTHCARE. THINK ABOUT THIS, THIS HAS</p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:30.679" end="00:01:33.048">TO DO WITH GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTHCARE AND HE SPENT THE</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:33.048" end="00:01:35.117">FIRST FOUR YEARS TELLING US THAT GOVERNMENT RUN</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:35.117" end="00:01:38.120">HEALTHCARE OR AT LEAST PLANS THAT WERE MANDATED BY THE</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:01:38.120" end="00:01:41.556">GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS OWE HE BAMA CARE, IS THE ANSWER.</p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:01:41.556" end="00:01:44.359">AND SO I THINK THAT THAT MAKES HIM VERY VULNERABLE.</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:44.359" end="00:01:46.328">&gt;&gt; THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE HERE.</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:01:46.328" end="00:01:47.696">&gt;&gt; SURE, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:01:47.696" end="00:01:51.500">THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN REBUT IT.</p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:01:51.500" end="00:01:53.635">THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION THEY RUN THE HOSPITALS, THEY</p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:01:53.635" end="00:01:56.938">HIRE THE DOCTORS. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT DO</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:01:56.938" end="00:02:02.444">THE HANDS ON CARE, OKAY? AND OBVIOUSLY, DOCTORS HAVE</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:02:02.444" end="00:02:06.548">COME FORWARD WHO WORK FOR THE V.A. AND SAY IT ISN’T</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:02:06.548" end="00:02:09.518">WORKING, THIS IS SCREWED UP. SO YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:02:09.518" end="00:02:10.819">THERE. 100% RIGHT, OKAY?</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:10.819" end="00:02:12.654">I DON’T KNOW IF THAT’S EVERY V.A. HOSPITAL.</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:12.654" end="00:02:16.558">BUT CERTAINLY THERE IS 26 STATES NOW BEING</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:16.558" end="00:02:19.060">INVESTIGATED. OBAMACARE ISN’T THAT.</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:19.060" end="00:02:23.365">THEY RUN THE INSURANCE, THE INSURANCE AND THEN YOU HAVE</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:23.365" end="00:02:27.636">TO GO TO SELECTED DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS TO TAKE THE</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:27.636" end="00:02:29.104">INSURANCE. TO SO IT’S A LITTLE BIT</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:29.104" end="00:02:32.340">DIFFERENT THAN A DIRECT HANDS ON, THE GOVERNMENT IS</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:32.340" end="00:02:36.077">TREATING THE PATIENT. BUT YOU SAY HE DISENGAGED</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:36.077" end="00:02:38.880">AND ED HENRY OUR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT SAID THE SAME</p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:02:38.880" end="00:02:41.216">THING. TOOK THE PRESIDENT 23 DAYS</p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:02:41.216" end="00:02:44.386">TO GET UP AND RUNNING AND YESTERDAY HE WAS OUTRAGED.</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:02:44.386" end="00:02:46.822">WELL, HE WASN’T OUTRAGED 23 DAYS AGO?</p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:02:46.822" end="00:02:54.196">SO I’M NOT UNDERSTANDING THE WHY OF THIS?</p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:02:54.196" end="00:02:56.531">IF YOU ALSO LOOK AT THE OTHER SCANDALS TOO.</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:02:56.531" end="00:02:58.567">FIVE DAYS TO RESPOND TO THE IRS SCANDAL.</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:02:58.567" end="00:03:03.138">A NUMBER OF DAYS TO RESPOND TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT -- I</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:03:03.138" end="00:03:06.741">THINK IT WAS THE B.P. OIL ISSUE WAS ABOUT 10 DAYS.</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:03:06.741" end="00:03:08.710">HE WAITS AND SEES HOW THIS PLAYS OUT.</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:03:08.710" end="00:03:11.813">THE REASON HE KEEPS PEOPLE LIKE GENERAL SHINSEKI IN</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:03:11.813" end="00:03:14.482">OFFICE AND KATHLEEN SEBELIUS WHO I DON’T THINK ARE</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:03:14.482" end="00:03:16.751">COMPARABLE IS BECAUSE THEY CAN RUN INTERFERENCE FOR</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:03:16.751" end="00:03:19.421">HIM. THEY CAN HANDLE THE PRESS</p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:03:19.421" end="00:03:20.455">CORPS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE</p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:03:20.455" end="00:03:22.791">DEALING WITH ALL THE INCOMING AND IT’S NOT HIM.</p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:03:22.791" end="00:03:25.594">SO HE DOESN’T WANT TO LET THEM GO UNTIL THIS THING</p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:03:25.594" end="00:03:28.363">BLOWS OVER AND THE MEDIA THAT IS IN LOVE WITH HIM</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:03:28.363" end="00:03:30.565">DECIDES THAT THEY ARE GOING TO STOP COVERING THIS STORY.</p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:03:30.565" end="00:03:33.168">AND I DO WANT TO ADD ONE THING TO WHAT YOU SAID.</p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="00:03:33.168" end="00:03:36.137">YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. OBAMACARE IS NOT EXACTLY</p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="00:03:36.137" end="00:03:40.075">SINGLE PAIR. -- PAYER.</p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="00:03:40.075" end="00:03:41.843">UNDER OBAMACARE, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE SIGNED UP</p>
   <p xml:id="74" begin="00:03:41.843" end="00:03:44.312">UNDER MEDICAID WHICH IS MORE SIMILAR TO THE V.A.</p>
   <p xml:id="75" begin="00:03:44.312" end="00:03:45.881">MEDICARE WHICH IS MORE SIMILAR.</p>
   <p xml:id="76" begin="00:03:45.881" end="00:03:48.049">AND A NUMBER OF PROGRESSIVES AND LEFTISTS IN THE</p>

   <p xml:id="78" begin="00:03:51.353" end="00:03:55.257">SECRETLY WANTED AND OPENLY WANTED A SINGLE PAIR AS PART</p>
   <p xml:id="79" begin="00:03:55.257" end="00:03:57.325">OF OBAMACARE BILL. REMEMBER, THEY DIDN’T GET IT</p>
   <p xml:id="80" begin="00:03:57.325" end="00:04:00.829">AS PART OF NEGOTIATIONS. SO THEY PUSHED FOR SOMETHING</p>
   <p xml:id="81" begin="00:04:00.829" end="00:04:03.531">VERY SIMILAR TO THE V.A. IF THEY HAD THEIR WISH AND</p>

   <p xml:id="83" begin="00:04:05.467" end="00:04:07.936">THEY LOVE IT. IT’S BIG GOVERNMENT RUN</p>
   <p xml:id="84" begin="00:04:07.936" end="00:04:09.337">HEALTHCARE. THIS ISN’T A SCANDAL, BILL.</p>
   <p xml:id="85" begin="00:04:09.337" end="00:04:12.874">THIS IS LIBERALISM FALLING ON ITS FACE EXPOSED TO THE</p>
