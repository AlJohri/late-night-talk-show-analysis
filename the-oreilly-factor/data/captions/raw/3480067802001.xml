   <p xml:id="7" begin="00:00:16.150" end="00:00:18.352">THAT WILL HAPPEN. BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE</p>
   <p xml:id="8" begin="00:00:18.352" end="00:00:21.288">BETWEEN WEAKNESS AND RESTRAINT.</p>
   <p xml:id="9" begin="00:00:21.288" end="00:00:24.491">AND THEREIN LIES THE REAL STORY OF PRESIDENT OBAMA’S</p>

   <p xml:id="15" begin="00:00:36.837" end="00:00:39.440">THE COUNTRY. SO, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA</p>

   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:23.484" end="00:01:25.686">DISCREDIT, HE PULLED THE SANCTIONS TOO EARLY.</p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:01:25.686" end="00:01:29.456">AND NOW NOBODY KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH IRAN’S</p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:01:29.456" end="00:01:32.125">NUKES. IN SYRIA, THE TYRANT ASSAD</p>

   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:01:54.481" end="00:01:56.917">CONSEQUENCES AND YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:01:56.917" end="00:02:00.621">&gt;&gt; AND ASSAD DID USE THE WEAPONS BUT THERE WERE NO</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:02:00.621" end="00:02:02.623">CONSEQUENCES. AND HE HAS NOT BEEN HELD</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:02.623" end="00:02:04.825">ACCOUNTABLE. THAT’S WEAKNESS.</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:04.825" end="00:02:08.595">FINALLY, PUTIN’S AGGRESSION IN UKRAINE.</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:08.595" end="00:02:12.466">&gt;&gt; WHAT I HAVE SAID CONSISTENTLY IS THAT EACH</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:12.466" end="00:02:16.603">TIME RUSSIA TAKES THESE KINDS OF STEPS THAT ARE</p>

   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:21.375" end="00:02:24.344">&gt;&gt; BUT, AGAIN, THERE HAVE BEEN FEW CONSEQUENCES FOR</p>

   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:02:29.216" end="00:02:32.152">POINT IN HISTORY, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS POWERLESS,</p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:02:32.152" end="00:02:34.555">POWERLESS TO STOP EVIL AGGRESSION.</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:02:34.555" end="00:02:37.658">IT’S NOT HIS FAULT ALONE. HIS PARTY, THE DEMOCRATS</p>

   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:02:41.862" end="00:02:45.532">GENERALLY SPEAKING, THERE IS NO WILL IN AMERICA TO FIGHT</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:02:45.532" end="00:02:47.367">EVIL UNLESS WE’RE DIRECTLY ATTACKED.</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:02:47.367" end="00:02:50.904">THE RESULT IS DANGER AND A WEAKENING OF PRESIDENTIAL</p>
