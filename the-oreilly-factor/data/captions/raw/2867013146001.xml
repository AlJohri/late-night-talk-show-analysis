   <p xml:id="2" begin="00:00:03.303" end="00:00:10.043">&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR STAYING WITH US. SARAH PALIN, CNN AND MSNBC.</p>
   <p xml:id="3" begin="00:00:10.043" end="00:00:12.045">IT ALL STARTED ABOUT TWO WEEKS  AGO.</p>
   <p xml:id="4" begin="00:00:12.045" end="00:00:15.282">SARAH PALIN COMPARED THE  NATIONAL DEBT TO SLAVERY.</p>
   <p xml:id="5" begin="00:00:15.282" end="00:00:20.053">&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY YOU DON’T LITERALLY MEAN IT’S LIKE SLAVERY WHICH </p>
   <p xml:id="6" begin="00:00:20.053" end="00:00:22.322">COST MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THEIR  LIVES AND THERE WAS RAPE AND </p>
   <p xml:id="7" begin="00:00:22.322" end="00:00:24.457">TORTURE. YOU’RE USING IT AS A METAPHOR, </p>
   <p xml:id="8" begin="00:00:24.457" end="00:00:28.161">BUT DON’T YOU EVER WORRY THAT  USING THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE YOU </p>
   <p xml:id="9" begin="00:00:28.161" end="00:00:30.263">RISK OBSCURING THE POINT YOU’RE  TRYING TO MAKE?</p>
   <p xml:id="10" begin="00:00:30.263" end="00:00:37.204">&gt;&gt; THERE IS ANOTHER DEFINITION  OF SLAVERY AND THAT IS BEING </p>
   <p xml:id="11" begin="00:00:37.204" end="00:00:40.340">BEHOLDEN TO SOME KIND OF MASTER  THAT IS NOT OF YOUR CHOOSING.</p>
   <p xml:id="12" begin="00:00:40.340" end="00:00:43.944">YES, THE NATIONAL DEBT WILL BE  LIKE SLAVERY WHEN THE NOTE COMES</p>
   <p xml:id="13" begin="00:00:43.944" end="00:00:47.347">DUE. &gt;&gt; AFTER THAT STATEMENT, MSNBC’S</p>
   <p xml:id="14" begin="00:00:47.347" end="00:00:51.451">MARTIN BESHEAR TOLD HIS VERY FEW VIEWERS THAT PERHAPS SOMEONE </p>
   <p xml:id="15" begin="00:00:51.451" end="00:00:55.021">SHOULD ASSAULT GOVERNOR PALIN IN A GROSS WAY.</p>
   <p xml:id="16" begin="00:00:55.021" end="00:00:58.258">BESHEAR HAS SINCE APOLOGIZED BUT HAS NOT BEEN SUSPENDED.</p>
   <p xml:id="17" begin="00:00:58.258" end="00:01:08.935">THEN A FEW DAYS LATER, CNN’S  CHRIS CUOMO SAID THIS.</p>
   <p xml:id="18" begin="00:01:08.935" end="00:01:11.104">&gt;&gt; IF YOU KNOW WHAT SLAVERY IS,  THIS SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU.</p>
   <p xml:id="19" begin="00:01:11.104" end="00:01:19.212">THEN HE SPENT THE LAST MINUTE  TELLING THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:01:19.212" end="00:01:22.315">HAPPENED TO SLAVES. DO YOU THINK HE WAS TRYING TO BE</p>
   <p xml:id="21" begin="00:01:22.315" end="00:01:24.184">VICIOUS TO SARAH PALIN? &gt;&gt; YES, OF COURSE.</p>
   <p xml:id="22" begin="00:01:24.184" end="00:01:28.255">&gt;&gt; YOU DON’T THINK HE WAS JUST  MAKING A RHETORICAL POINT AND </p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:01:28.255" end="00:01:30.857">THIS WAS A MISTAKE OF HOW TO DO  IT?</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:01:30.857" end="00:01:35.428">&gt;&gt; AND YOU SAY? &gt;&gt; WELL, ON THE CHRIS CUOMO </p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:01:35.428" end="00:01:42.369">THING, BILL, I SAY THAT CUOMO IS GOING OUT OF HIS WAY TO AT LEAST</p>
   <p xml:id="26" begin="00:01:42.369" end="00:01:49.909">FIND CONTEXT OR WHAT DID MARTIN  BESHEAR REALLY MEAN WHEN HE MID </p>
   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:49.909" end="00:01:54.047">THAT VILE COMMENT? THEN HE ASKED THAT DUMB QUESTION</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:54.047" end="00:01:57.484">ABOUT, DO YOU THINK MARTIN  BESHEAR WAS SAVAGELY ATTACKING </p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:57.484" end="00:01:59.452">SARAH PALIN? THIS TELLS ME ONE THING AND ONLY</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:59.452" end="00:02:02.722">ONE THING, THAT CHRIS CUOMO  DOESN’T LIKE SARAH PALIN, </p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:02:02.722" end="00:02:06.426">EITHER. &gt;&gt; COULD IT BE -- AND I KNOW </p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="00:02:06.426" end="00:02:08.561">CUOMO, HE USED TO WORK HERE AT  FOX.</p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:02:08.561" end="00:02:11.798">COULD IT BE HE DOESN’T KNOW  MARTIN BESHEAR?</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:02:11.798" end="00:02:13.833">BECAUSE, LOOK, IF YOU KNOW WHAT  BESHEAR DOES -- </p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:02:13.833" end="00:02:18.772">&gt;&gt; COULD IT BE THAT HE’S MARTIN  BESHEAR’S BUDDY?</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:02:18.772" end="00:02:21.641">THAT’S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. &gt;&gt; MAYBE.</p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:02:21.641" end="00:02:23.576">MAYBE. IF YOU KNOW MARTIN BESHEAR AND </p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:02:23.576" end="00:02:26.913">YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES ALL THE  TIME, YOU COULDN’T ASK THAT </p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:02:26.913" end="00:02:29.816">QUESTION BECAUSE HE’S A SMEAR  MERCHANT.</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:02:29.816" end="00:02:31.451">HE SMEARS. THAT’S WHAT HE DOES.</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:02:31.451" end="00:02:34.187">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD YOU GIVE A GUY WHO </p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:02:34.187" end="00:02:37.991">IS DOING THIS FOR A LIVING THE  BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT?</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:02:37.991" end="00:02:43.263">NOW, IF IT HAD BEEN WOLF BLITZER WHO NEVER SMEARS, THEN THE CUOMO</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:43.263" end="00:02:45.365">QUESTION, I THINK, WOULD HAVE  BEEN VALID.</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:45.365" end="00:02:47.534">&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU’RE MAKING MY  POINT.</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:47.534" end="00:02:54.574">HERE’S CHRIS CUOMO SAYING HE’S  LOOKING FOR, IF NOT AN EXCUSE, </p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:54.574" end="00:03:00.847">AT LEAST HE SEEMS TO BE  DEFENDING THE INDEFENSIBLE OR AT</p>

   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:03:04.384" end="00:03:07.854">WE’RE NOT EVEN SAYING WHAT IT IS TONIGHT ON THE AIR.</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:03:07.854" end="00:03:12.525">THAT’S HOW OVER THE LINE AND HOW NASTY THAT COMMENT WAS.</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:03:12.525" end="00:03:15.528">SO IF YOU’RE TRYING TO FIND  MEANING AND CONTEXT AND ALL </p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:03:15.528" end="00:03:19.065">THIS, WOULD HE TRY TO FIND  MEANING IF SOMEBODY MADE AN </p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:03:19.065" end="00:03:23.903">EQUALLY VILE REMARK ABOUT GAYS  OR WOMEN OR MUSLIMS?</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:03:23.903" end="00:03:25.772">NO. HE WOULD CONDEMN IT AS ALL </p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:03:25.772" end="00:03:28.608">DECENT PEOPLE WOULD. &gt;&gt; HE GETS MORE PERSONAL THAN </p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:03:28.608" end="00:03:34.414">NOT. I THINK LIMBAUGH MADE POINT THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:03:34.414" end="00:03:36.316">IF I HAD SAID THIS OR CHARLES  CRAMER HAD SAID THIS ABOUT A </p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:03:36.316" end="00:03:38.518">LIBERAL POLITICIAN, OR EVEN  SARAH PALIN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN </p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:03:38.518" end="00:03:44.391">A RIOT, OKAY? THE OTHER POINT IS THIS GUY JOE </p>

   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:03:58.304" end="00:04:01.341">NAIVE ABOUT THIS. &gt;&gt; YOU’RE GIVING HIM TOO MUCH </p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:04:01.341" end="00:04:03.143">CREDIT. IT ISN’T A MATTER OF BEING </p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:04:03.143" end="00:04:05.345">NAIVE, IT’S A MATTER OF BEING  LIBERAL.</p>
