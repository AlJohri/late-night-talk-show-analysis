   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:06.527" end="00:02:08.662">MR. OBAMA DIDN’T ADDRESS EITHER OF THOSE THINGS TODAY</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:08.662" end="00:02:10.164">AND THEY ARE CRUCIAL IN THE DEBATE.</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:10.164" end="00:02:13.100">ALSO, MR. OBAMA DID NOT ADDRESS THE FALSEHOODS UNDER</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:13.100" end="00:02:15.369">WHICH THE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE LAW WAS PASSED.</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:15.369" end="00:02:19.807">BUT THE NEW SPIN FROM HIS ALLIES IS THIS:</p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:02:19.807" end="00:02:22.509">&gt;&gt; ALL AMERICANS KNOW POLITICIANS LIE.</p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:02:22.509" end="00:02:24.778">THE QUESTION IS WHICH LIES CAN YOU LIVE WITH?</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:02:24.778" end="00:02:27.848">AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN AMERICANS HAVE SAID WE CAN</p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:02:27.848" end="00:02:30.818">DEAL WITH THE LIES THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA TELLS US</p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:02:30.818" end="00:02:33.854">BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN HIS HEART HE HAS THE BEST</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:02:33.854" end="00:02:35.589">INTEREST FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:02:35.589" end="00:02:38.992">&gt;&gt; SO THAT’S WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS SELLING THAT</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:02:38.992" end="00:02:41.995">PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTS WHAT IS BEST FOR THE FOLKS.</p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:02:41.995" end="00:02:46.567">AND I BELIEVE THAT’S TRUE IN THEORY, IN THEORY.</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:02:46.567" end="00:02:48.969">HE DOES WANT WHAT’S BEST FOR THE FOLKS.</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:02:48.969" end="00:02:53.774">THE PROBLEM IS HIS VISION IS RUNNING UP AGAINST REALITY.</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:02:53.774" end="00:02:58.579">THE ECONOMY IS BEING HELD BACK BY HIS TAX POLICIES AND</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:02:58.579" end="00:03:00.748">BY OBAMA CARE MANDATES ON BUSINESS.</p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:03:00.748" end="00:03:04.885">THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT THAT’S NOT WHAT’S BEST.</p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:03:04.885" end="00:03:08.522">THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY IN AMERICA WILL SUFFER FROM</p>
