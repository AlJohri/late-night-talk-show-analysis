   <p xml:id="2" begin="00:00:02.202" end="00:00:04.905">REPORTING, THE CITY OF CHICAGO HAS SEEN ITS MURDER RATE EXPLODE</p>
   <p xml:id="3" begin="00:00:04.905" end="00:00:07.808">IN RECENT YEARS. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN</p>
   <p xml:id="4" begin="00:00:07.808" end="00:00:11.512">OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE MASSACRES IN TUCSON, AURORA AND NEWTOWN.</p>
   <p xml:id="5" begin="00:00:11.512" end="00:00:15.416">BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL TODAY THAT HE REALLY ADDRESSED THE</p>
   <p xml:id="6" begin="00:00:15.416" end="00:00:21.755">SITUATION IN HIS HOMETOWN. >> LAST YEAR THERE WERE 443</p>

   <p xml:id="8" begin="00:00:27.561" end="00:00:31.165">AND 65 OF THOSE VICTIMS WERE 18 AND UNDER.</p>
   <p xml:id="9" begin="00:00:31.165" end="00:00:35.769">SO THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF A NEWTOWN EVERY FOUR MONTHS.</p>
   <p xml:id="10" begin="00:00:35.769" end="00:00:38.072">FOR A LOT OF YOUNG BOYS AND YOUNG MEN IN PARTICULAR, THEY</p>

   <p xml:id="13" begin="00:00:55.823" end="00:00:59.026">RESPECTED. SO THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS NOT</p>
   <p xml:id="14" begin="00:00:59.026" end="00:01:03.130">JUST A GUN ISSUE. IT'S ALSO AN ISSUE OF THE KINDS</p>

   <p xml:id="19" begin="00:01:14.842" end="00:01:18.145">HOW IS THE PRESIDENT BEING RECEIVED IN CHICAGO FINALLY</p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:01:18.145" end="00:01:22.383">MAKING REMARKS ABOUT THE MURDER SITUATION THERE?</p>

   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:01:28.923" end="00:01:32.398">I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S OVERDUE, BUT NECESSARY.</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:01:32.398" end="00:01:35.835">A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WANT TO HEAR FROM SOMEBODY WHO</p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="00:01:35.835" end="00:01:38.370">IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND FROM THEIR HOMETOWN.</p>
   <p xml:id="26" begin="00:01:38.370" end="00:01:41.874">BUT AS THE PRESIDENT STATED AND I WAS GLAD HE SAID IT -- THIS IS</p>
   <p xml:id="27" begin="00:01:41.874" end="00:01:44.844">MORE THAN A GUN ISSUE. THIS IS MORE THAN AN ISSUE ABOUT</p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="00:01:44.844" end="00:01:47.079">GOVERNMENT AND WHAT GOVERNMENT CAN DO FOR THE COMMUNITY.</p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="00:01:47.079" end="00:01:49.849">THIS IS ABOUT WHAT THE COMMUNITY HAS TO DO FOR ITSELF.</p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:49.849" end="00:01:53.085">FIRST AND FOREMOST. AND IF THAT MESSAGE RESONATES</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:53.085" end="00:01:56.188">WITH PEOPLE NOT ONLY IN CHICAGO, BUT IN OTHER CITIES ACROSS THE</p>

   <p xml:id="33" begin="00:01:59.091" end="00:02:01.393">THAT CHICAGO IS, THEN THERE IS A STRONG MESSAGE.</p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:02:01.393" end="00:02:04.764">THIS WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. >> Juan: MATT, I JUST WANT TO</p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="00:02:04.764" end="00:02:07.366">SAY AMEN. I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.</p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="00:02:07.366" end="00:02:10.469">WHAT TOOK THE PRESIDENT SO LONG? MATT SAYS HE DOESN'T THINK IT</p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:02:10.469" end="00:02:13.272">TOOK -- I THINK IT TOOK WAY TOO LONG.</p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:02:13.272" end="00:02:18.046">THE PRESIDENT IN HIS HOMETOWN, TO CONNECT THE DOTS AND SAY WHEN</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:02:18.046" end="00:02:20.582">YOU HAVE FAMILY BREAKDOWN, AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE BLACK</p>

   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:44.072" end="00:02:47.809">BUT AS MATT SAID, IT'S REALLY MORE THAN A GUN ISSUE, JUAN.</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:47.809" end="00:02:51.079">I THINK THAT HE HAS BEEN ADDRESSING IT IN A VARIETY OF</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:51.079" end="00:02:52.581">WAYS. IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO COME HOME.</p>

   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:03:02.391" end="00:03:05.794">AND A SEMINAL MOMENT IN THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FAMILY.</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:03:05.794" end="00:03:08.297">THAT'S WHAT I REALLY THINK IS THE LARGER ISSUE.</p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:03:08.297" end="00:03:10.532">HOW DO WE PUT OUR FAMILIES BACK TOGETHER?</p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:03:10.532" end="00:03:16.572">HOW DO WE PROVIDE HOPE TO INNER CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY?</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:03:16.572" end="00:03:18.106">>> Juan: THAT'S RIGHT. BUT THE THING IS, YOU GOT TO</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:03:18.106" end="00:03:22.010">SPEAK TO THE ISSUE ABOUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT LEAD YOUNG MEN</p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="00:03:22.010" end="00:03:27.416">TO THINK THAT IT'S OKAY TO SHOOT A LITTLE GIRL IN A PLAYGROUND</p>
