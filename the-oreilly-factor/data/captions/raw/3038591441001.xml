   <p xml:id="3" begin="00:00:04.505" end="00:00:07.274">IT SAYS THAT NEARLY HALF OF ALL BLACK MALES UNDER THE</p>
   <p xml:id="4" begin="00:00:07.274" end="00:00:10.678">AGE OF 23 HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN THE U.S.A. AND NEARLY 40%</p>
   <p xml:id="5" begin="00:00:10.678" end="00:00:13.847">OF WHITE MALES IN THAT AGE GROUP HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AS</p>
   <p xml:id="6" begin="00:00:13.847" end="00:00:16.050">WELL. THE STUDY EXAMINED DATA FROM</p>
   <p xml:id="7" begin="00:00:16.050" end="00:00:19.086">1997 TO 2008. JOINING US NOW FROM ALBANY,</p>

   <p xml:id="11" begin="00:00:28.462" end="00:00:30.631">BEING ARRESTED FOR, DOCTOR. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW PEOPLE ARRESTED</p>
   <p xml:id="12" begin="00:00:30.631" end="00:00:34.234">FOR THE FIRST TIME IT’S THE MAJORITY ARE FOR RELATIVELY</p>
   <p xml:id="13" begin="00:00:34.234" end="00:00:36.904">MINOR CRIMES LIKE PROPERTY DESTRUCTION, DRUG</p>
   <p xml:id="14" begin="00:00:36.904" end="00:00:39.506">POSSESSION, OR DISORDERLY CONDUCT.</p>
   <p xml:id="15" begin="00:00:39.506" end="00:00:43.277">BUT WE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED MINOR TRAFFIC OFFENSES FROM</p>
   <p xml:id="16" begin="00:00:43.277" end="00:00:45.746">THE STUDY. &gt;&gt; SO NO TRAFFIC BEEFS</p>

   <p xml:id="19" begin="00:00:50.451" end="00:00:53.187">BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A SHOCKINGLY HIGH NUMBER.</p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="00:00:53.187" end="00:00:56.690">ONE OUT OF EVERY TWO YOUNG BLACK MALES ARRESTED?</p>

   <p xml:id="22" begin="00:00:58.125" end="00:01:00.527">ARE WE IN A DECLINE OF MORAL VALUES?</p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="00:01:00.527" end="00:01:03.631">WHAT DOES THAT SAY? &gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK THE FIRST</p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="00:01:03.631" end="00:01:08.335">THING TO REALIZE IS THAT THERE IS A RELATIVELY UNIQUE</p>

   <p xml:id="30" begin="00:01:24.051" end="00:01:26.787">AROUND 4 -- IS AROUND 40% FROM OUR STUDY.</p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="00:01:26.787" end="00:01:30.424">SO, YOU KNOW, IT ISN’T A NEW THING THAT THIS LEVEL OF</p>

   <p xml:id="34" begin="00:01:34.428" end="00:01:36.530">IS A RELATIVELY COMMON EXPERIENCE.</p>

   <p xml:id="37" begin="00:01:43.504" end="00:01:45.472">PARTLY DUE TO CHANGES IN POLICING PRACTICE.</p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="00:01:45.472" end="00:01:47.274">&gt;&gt; WE WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF POINTS.</p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="00:01:47.274" end="00:01:49.143">NUMBER ONE, ARREST IS NOT A CONVICTION.</p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="00:01:49.143" end="00:01:51.478">YOU JUST STUDIED ARRESTS AND NOT CONVICTIONS.</p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="00:01:51.478" end="00:01:55.315">NUMBER TWO, THERE SEEMS TO BE A RACIAL ASPECT HERE.</p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="00:01:55.315" end="00:01:58.585">ALTHOUGH, NOT AS MUCH AS SOME THOUGHT.</p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="00:01:58.585" end="00:02:02.589">38% FOR WHITES. AUTO% FOR BLACKS.</p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="00:02:02.589" end="00:02:05.893">YOU KNOW, THAT’S HIGH. THAT’S A HIGH RATIO WHEN YOU</p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="00:02:05.893" end="00:02:08.762">CONSIDER THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN</p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="00:02:08.762" end="00:02:11.165">YOUNG MEN MUCH, MUCH HIGHER THAN WHITES.</p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="00:02:11.165" end="00:02:14.234">MUCH, MUCH HIGHER. NOW, IS THIS ECONOMICALLY</p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="00:02:14.234" end="00:02:17.204">DRIVEN IN YOUR STUDY? IS IT BECAUSE WE HAVE AN</p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="00:02:17.204" end="00:02:20.240">ECONOMY THAT’S BOOM OR BUST? IS THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO</p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="00:02:20.240" end="00:02:23.777">WITH IT? &gt;&gt; I MEAN, I THINK THAT IN</p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="00:02:23.777" end="00:02:26.080">TERMS OF THE RACIAL ASPECT, IT’S INTERESTING THAT WE</p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:28.716">DIDN’T FIND A RACIAL DIFFERENCE FOR WOMEN.</p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="00:02:28.716" end="00:02:31.618">AND THESE NUMBERS AREN’T AS HIGH AS IF YOU LOOK AT THE</p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="00:02:31.618" end="00:02:34.655">RACIAL DISPARITIES FOR ARREST RATES FROM THE FBI.</p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="00:02:34.655" end="00:02:36.657">THE DIFFERENCE IS WE ARE ASKING A DIFFERENT QUESTION</p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="00:02:36.657" end="00:02:39.993">WHICH IS WHAT IS THE CUMULATIVE PREVALENCE OF AT</p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="00:02:39.993" end="00:02:41.895">LEAST ONE ARREST. THE QUESTION HERE IS JUST</p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="00:02:41.895" end="00:02:44.364">THE LEVEL OF DO YOU HAVE AN ARREST AS OPPOSED TO HOW</p>

   <p xml:id="60" begin="00:02:48.936" end="00:02:50.437">THE ECONOMY. &gt;&gt;</p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="00:02:50.437" end="00:02:52.873">&gt;&gt; DEFINITELY POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; MEN OVERWHELMINGLY COMMIT</p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="00:02:52.873" end="00:02:56.009">MOST OF THE CRIMES IN THIS COUNTRY AND ARE ARRESTED FOR</p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="00:02:56.009" end="00:03:00.414">MOST OF THE CRIMES. IT’S LIKE 5, 6 TO 1 ARRESTS</p>
   <p xml:id="64" begin="00:03:00.414" end="00:03:03.817">WOMEN TO MEN. I’M WONDERING IF IT IS A</p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="00:03:03.817" end="00:03:08.756">SIGN OF THE TIMES HERE THAT WE HAVE DETERIORATED AS A</p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="00:03:08.756" end="00:03:12.226">COUNTRY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MORE ACCEPTING OF BAD</p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="00:03:12.226" end="00:03:14.461">BEHAVIOR? AND THAT’S THEORETICAL.</p>
   <p xml:id="68" begin="00:03:14.461" end="00:03:16.663">I DON’T KNOW WHETHER YOU GOT INTO THAT OR NOT.</p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="00:03:16.663" end="00:03:19.433">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT REMEMBER, THE NUMBERS AREN’T</p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="00:03:19.433" end="00:03:22.069">THAT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE FOUND IN THE 1960’S.</p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="00:03:22.069" end="00:03:25.305">SO IT’S HARD TO ARGUE THAT THIS HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC</p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="00:03:25.305" end="00:03:29.042">SHIFT. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW, WE MAY</p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="00:03:29.042" end="00:03:31.745">BE LESS TOLERANT OF CERTAIN TYPES OF CRIMES THAN WE WERE</p>
   <p xml:id="74" begin="00:03:31.745" end="00:03:33.280">IN THE PAST. I DON’T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE</p>
