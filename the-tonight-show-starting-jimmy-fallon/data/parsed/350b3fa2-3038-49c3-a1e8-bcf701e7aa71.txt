IT WAS GREAT.
Jimmy: IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN TEACH, I MEAN, AROUND THE WORLD.
FOR ME, ONE OF THE REASONS I LOVE DOING IT IS BECAUSE I WAS SOMEBODY WHO GOT TO GO TO THESE KIND OF CLASSES WHEN I WAS A A KID. AND I DID ONE WITH JACK LEMON WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD. AND IT WAS ALMOST A A LIFE-CHANGING MOMENT FOR ME.
Jimmy: CAN YOU TELL THE STORY ABOUT AL PACINO AND "GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS"? HE TOLD THIS BACKSTAGE. THIS IS THE TRUTH.
THIS IS A GREAT STORY. THIS IS A STORY ABOUT HOW AN ACTOR CAN BE INCREDIBLY GENEROUS TO ANOTHER ACTOR. SO, I DID THIS MOVIE WITH PACINO CALLED, "GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS."

WELL, BOTH OF YOU DID GREAT. BUT THE PERSON THAT WAS MOST BELIEVABLE WAS -- KEVIN. JUST KIDDING. JIMMY! [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: NO, HE'S RIGHT. YOU WERE MORE BELIEVABLE. HE LIKES ME BETTER. JASMINE, IT COMES DOWN TO YOU.
OKAY. WELL, I LOVE BOTH YOU GUYS. YOU GUYS DID REALLY AMAZING, BUT -- KEVIN, YOU DID BETTER. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: LAST NIGHT, THE 2016 GATES ANNUAL LETTER WAS PUBLISHED, AT GATESLETTER.COM. AND IT'S MAKING HEADLINES WORLDWIDE TODAY. HERE TO TELL US ABOUT THIS YEAR'S LETTER AND CATCH US UP ON THE GOOD WORK THAT BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION IS UP TO NOWADAYS, PLEASE SAY HELLO TO BILL AND MELINDA GATES, EVERYONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: WELCOME TO THE SHOW. BILL, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. MELINDA, IT'S A PLEASURE MEETING YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. I APPRECIATE THIS. AND I ALWAYS -- I'M SORRY. JUST OUT OF RESPECT, I SHOULD JUST -- [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVE YOU GUYS. I REALLY DO LOVE YOU AND THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW EVERY TIME YOU'RE HERE. I JUST WANT TO LET PEOPLE KNOW HOW MANY GOOD THINGS YOU'RE DOING. I LIKE TO REMIND PEOPLE, SINCE 2000, MATERNAL DEATHS HAVE ALMOST HALVED. CHILD MORTALITY AND MALARIA DEATHS HAVE HALVED. 17 MILLION LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM MALARIA, AIDS AND TUBERCULOSIS. WOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THIS YEAR, GATESLETTER.COM, CHECK IT OUT, IT IS BASED ON YOU'RE TALKING TO HIGH SCHOOL KIDS IN KENTUCKY. AND THEY SAY, "IF YOU HAD A A SUPERPOWER WHAT WOULD IT BE?" AND YOU SPLIT THIS LETTER UP INTO TWO. MELINDA, YOU ANSWERED, AND BILL, YOU ANSWERED SEPARATELY, BUT STILL KIND OF CONNECTED. WHAT WAS YOUR ANSWER?
MY ANSWER IS IF I COULD HAVE ANY SUPERPOWER, IT WOULD BE TIME. YOU KNOW, WE ALL WE ONLY HAVE 24 HOURS IN THE DAY.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND I FUNDAMENTALLY HAVE COME TO BELIEVE THROUGH THIS WORK THAT TO EMPOWER WOMEN TO REACH THEIR POTENTIAL, WE NEED TO GIVE THEM BACK TIME. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WOMEN DO ALL OVER THE WORLD -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AT HOME THEY DO ALL THIS UNPAID WORK THAT WE DON'T CALL WORK, WHETHER IT IS CARING FOR A A CHILD, WHICH THEY LIKE TO DO OR AN ELDERLY PERSON, BUT IT'S ALSO CHORES. AND IN THE U.S., WOMEN SPEND FOUR HOURS A DAY OF UNPAID WORK THAT WE DON'T THINK OF AS WORK, AND AROUND THE WORLD IT IS FOUR AND A HALF HOURS AND SOME PLACES, SIX. AND I THINK IF WE COULD GIVE THEM THAT TIME BACK OR SOME OF IT, REDISTRIBUTE IT SO HUSBANDS HELP THEM DO SOME OF THE WORK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YES! THEY WOULD REALLY REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT, RIGHT? BILL? [ LAUGHTER ]
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: IN A NUT SHELL, WHAT WAS YOUR ANSWER?
ENERGY. ENERGY IS PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL. THE IDEA YOU CAN JUST FLIP THAT LIGHT SWITCH COMES ON OR SETS THE TEMPERATURE. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THAT. OVER A BILLION, AND YET, WE NEED TO BUILD OUT ALL THIS ENERGY IN A WAY THAT AVOIDS CLIMATE CHANGE. SO WE NEED A LOT OF INNOVATION, SO I'D TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE GOT TO INVEST IN IT, AND THE NEXT GENERATION HAS TO COME ALONG AND DO THE SCIENCE, SO WE MOVE QUICKLY TO GET A A BREAKTHROUGH IN ENERGY INNOVATION.
Jimmy: YOU'RE ALWAYS UP FOR -- ANY NEW IDEAS OR SOME FUN THING. I ALWAYS LOVE READING IT. AND YOU WANT TO ALWAYS GET THE WORD OUT, GATESLETTER.COM. I MEAN, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT, TO GET THAT OUT, GATESLETTER.COM. I MEAN, BESIDES THIS INTERVIEW, WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU DO TO GET THAT OUT TO THE PEOPLE SO THEY WOULD KNOW TO GO CHECK OUT GATESLETTER.COM?
WELL, IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MELINDA AND ME. SO THE ANSWER IS, I WOULD DO ANYTHING. [ ECHOES ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪
