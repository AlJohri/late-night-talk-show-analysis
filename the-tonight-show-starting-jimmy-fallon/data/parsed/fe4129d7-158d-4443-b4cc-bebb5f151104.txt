IN A NEW NATIONAL POLL, FOUND THAT BEN CARSON IS NOW AHEAD OF DONALD TRUMP BY SIX POINTS IN THE REPUBLICAN RACE. [ CHEERS ] FINALLY PROVING THAT YOU CAN LITERALLY SLEEP YOUR WAY TO THE TOP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I SAW THAT AFTER BEING COURTED BY SEVERAL CANDIDATES, CONSERVATIVE BILLIONAIRE PAUL SINGER HAS DECIDED TO ENDORSE MARCO RUBIO. YEAH. NOW, INSTEAD OF HAVING A BUTTON THAT SAYS DONATE, RUBIO'S WEBSITE JUST SAYS, "WE GOOD." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE GOOD. MEANWHILE, JEB BUSH'S CAMPAIGN SAYS THAT THEY WANT TO BRING BACK THE CANCELLED TELEMUNDO DEBATE, BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS THREATENED TO BOYCOTT IT RATHER THAN GO. WHEN THEY HEARD THAT, TELEMUNDO WAS LIKE, "AY, DIOS MIO." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AROUND THE REPUBLICAN DEBATES. IN FACT, SOME OF THE GOP CANDIDATES RELEASED A JOINT LETTER DEMANDING CHANGES TO THE DEBATE RULES, AND NOW OTHER CANDIDATES LIKE CHRIS CHRISTIE AND CARLY FIORINA ARE REFUSING TO SIGN THE LETTER. IT SEEMS LIKE NO ONE IS HAPPY. SO, HERE TO SETTLE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL WITH SOME NEW DEMANDS FOR THE NEXT DEBATE IS BILL O'REILLY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ OKAY, BILL.

GUYS, LISTEN TO THIS, I READ THAT A GUY WHO USED THE CHEATING WEBSITE ASHLEY MADISON IS SUING THE SITE FOR CLAIMING THAT IT HAD MILLIONS OF FEMALE USERS WHEN IN FACT IT ONLY HAD 12,000. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THE MAN IS SUING FOR $5 MILLION OR AS HIS WIFE PUT IT, $2.5 MILLION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HOPE YOU WIN, IDIOT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS. I JUST SAW THAT GUINNESS ANNOUNCED IT IS GOING TO STOP USING FISH BLADDERS IN THE BREWING PROCESS STARTING NEXT YEAR. IN RESPONSE, GUINNESS DRINKERS ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING, WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ] FISH BLADDERS? THAT'S RIGHT, GUINNESS ANNOUNCED IT'S GOING TO STOP USING FISH BLADDERS IN ITS BREWING PROCESS STARTING NEXT YEAR, WHICH WILL MAKE THE BEER VEGAN FRIENDLY. SO, IF YOU THOUGHT VEGANS WERE ANNOYING BEFORE, WAIT UNTIL THEY START DRINKING. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW HOW MANY FISH BLADDERS ARE IN THIS BEER? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

AND AS SOON AS THAT MOVIE COMES OUT, I'LL BE ABLE TO TURN IN A A BOOK REPORT THAT WAS DUE 30 YEARS AGO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S MY 600th EXTENSION. THAT'S RIGHT, A BIG BUDGET MOVIE ABOUT "MOBY DICK," MAKING IT THE MOST EXPENSIVE DICK PIC SINCE ANTHONY WEINER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HO! HEY-YOW!
WIENER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WARNER BROTHERS JUST RELEASING A FINAL TRAILER FOR ITS UPCOMING ADVENTURE MOVIE, "IN THE HEART OF THE SEA," WHICH WAS BASED ON THE TRUE STORY THAT INSPIRED "MOBY DICK." OF COURSE, "MOBY DICK" IS 1,000 PAGES LONG. BUT, I THINK THEY DID A GOOD JOB OF DOING THE STORY JUSTICE. TAKE A LOOK.
COMING TO A THEATER NEAR YOU, IT'S THE STUNNING TRUE STORY OF "MOBY DICK," BASED ON THE TALE OF A YOUNG MAN JUST TRYING TO SLEEP IN A CROWDED INN, BUT WHO IS KEPT AWAKE BY A A ROYAL HARPOONER, WHO TELLS HIM OF HIS LIFE ON THE ISLAND OF ROKOVOKO, WHERE HIS FATHER WAS ONCE KING. INSPIRING THE YOUNG MAN TO GO WITH SAID ROYAL HARPOONER TO A A SERMON, WHERE HE CONSIDERS THE BIBLICAL STORY OF JONAH AND WHAT IT MEANS TO HIM AND HIS OWN LIFE. LEADING HIM ON AN ADVENTURE TO NANTUCKET, AND A PROSPECT OF GETTING ON A BOAT, UNTIL HE HEARS A PROPHECY THAT SAYS DON'T GET ON THE BOAT, AT WHICH POINT HE'S REALLY GOT TO THINK THINGS THROUGH.

SURE.
Jimmy: I APPRECIATE THAT.
ANY TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT CNBC DEBATE? WAS IT SUCH A DISASTER, LIKE EVERYONE SAID IT IS?
WELL, I MEAN IT WAS A A DISASTER FOR CNBC BECAUSE YOU BASICALLY, YOU CAN BE TOUGH ON -- AND YOU SHOULD BE, ANY MODERATOR SHOULD BE TOUGH ON THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WANT POWER OVER ALL OF US, SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO PUT THEM THROUGH THEIR PACES. BUT WHEN YOU'RE OPENLY HOSTILE, THEN IT BECOMES, AS CRUZ SAID, A CAGE MATCH.
AND THEN PEOPLE GET UNCOMFORTABLE SO YOU DON'T GET ENOUGH INFORMATION COMING OUT. AND THAT WAS A MISTAKE THAT THE CNBC PEOPLE MADE.
Jimmy: BUT NOW IT'S A BIG DEAL. NOW THEY'RE SIGNING LETTERS. THEY'RE NOT GONNA GO. JEB BUSH WANTS TO DO TELEMUNDO THEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS NO WAY. HE'S NOT GONNA DO IT. IT'S LIKE -- IT'S INSANE. IT'S GREAT FOR US. GREAT FOR COMEDY, BUT -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
THE NEXT DEBATE IS NEXT TUESDAY ON THE FOX BUSINESS CHANNEL.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO THEY'RE PREPPING NOW FOR IT. I THINK YOU'LL SEE A DIFFERENT PRESENTATION, BUT AS WE SAID IN THE OPENING STUFF, THESE GUYS GOT TO STOP WHINING. I MEAN THEY GOTTA, YOU KNOW, IF YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY -- [ APPLAUSE ] YOU GOT A MICROPHONE. LET THEM HAVE IT.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW, LET THEM HAVE IT. I MEAN THAT'S WHY TRUMP IS AHEAD IN THE POLLS, BECAUSE HE JUST SAYS WHAT HE WANTS TO SAY AND HE TAKES ON ALL COMERS, AND THE FOLKS WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE MADE OUT OF.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S WHAT, I THINK THE PEOPLE WANT NOW, RIGHT? THEY WANT SOMEONE TO SAY I'M GOING TO FIX OR I'M GONNA CHANGE OR DO SOMETHING RIGHT. I GONNA FIX --
THIS IS AT A UNIQUE TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY. FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE HAVE TWO OUTSIDERS WHO MAY GET THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. THAT'S NEVER REALLY HAPPENED IN OUR LIFETIME. USUALLY YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE POLITICAL GAME AND BE A A GOVERNOR OR A SENATOR OR A A CONGRESSMAN.
Jimmy: CAUSE THEY HAVE NO POLITICAL EXPERIENCE.
THEY'VE HAD NONE. YOU KNOW, TRUMP BUILDS BUILDINGS AND CARSON'S A A DOCTOR. BUT PEOPLE ARE SO ANGRY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE ABOUT THE STATE OF THE NATION, THE STATE OF THE UNION, THEY NOT ONLY WANT A A PRESIDENT, THEY WANT AN AVENGER. AND SO THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO WEAR THE SUIT THEY HAVE, THE AVENGER SUIT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THEY COME IN AND JUST DISMANTLE A LOT OF THE POLICIES THAT REPUBLICANS AND SOME INDEPENDENTS FEEL ARE HARMING THEIR COUNTRY.
Jimmy: CAUSE RIGHT NOW IN THE POLLS, I THINK TODAY -- IT'S ALWAYS CHANGING BUT TODAY ITS BEN CARSON IS IN THE LEAD.
IN THE NBC POLL, YES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
NOT THE CNBC POLL.
Jimmy: ARE THEY STILL DOING POLLS?
YEAH, NOBODY GOT ANY RATINGS THERE. IN THE CNBC POLL. [ LAUGHTER ]
THEY'RE ALL AT ZERO PERCENT.
Jimmy: ZERO, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THE GUYS HAVE BEEN FIRED. YEAH. BUT DOES IT MATTER AT THIS POINT?
NAH, IT'S EMOTION NOW, YOU KNOW? I THINK AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR, HERMAN CAIN WAS IN THE LEAD.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
AND THEN HE HAD TO GO BACK TO DELIVERING THE PIZZAS.
Jimmy: PIZZA, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
SO HE KIND OF FELL FAST. NEXT WEEK AFTER THE FOX BUSINESS DEBATE YOU'LL SEE THE POLLS START TO TAKE ON A LITTLE MORE. BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY FIVE CONTENDERS RIGHT NOW. THE OTHERS ARE 3% OR LESS, AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO START TO DROP OUT SOON.
Jimmy: I MEAN, CAUSE IT'S GOT TO COST MONEY TO DO ALL THIS STUFF. I MEAN --
RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND IT'S TOUGH TO DO, I WOULD THINK, TO DO ANY DEBATE, TO BE A MODERATOR WITH 15 PEOPLE DEBATING.
IT'S VERY HARD TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU FORGET THEIR NAMES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU ARE?
Jimmy: YEAH, I FORGOT WHO YOU ARE.
RIGHT. WHO?
Jimmy: THIS GUY, HE JUST WROTE IN TODAY. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING TOO THAT EVEN DONALD TRUMP AND BEN CARSON, THAT THEY WON'T GET THE NOMINATION EITHER WAY.
WELL, I THINK THEY HAVE A A SHOT AT IT. I MEAN, IF THEY WIN THE PRIMARIES, THEY'RE CERTAINLY GONNA GET THE NOMINATION. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ITSELF FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE WITH A STANDARD POLITICIAN LIKE RONALD REAGAN. I MEAN REAGAN WAS A GOVERNOR, TWO TERMS OF CALIFORNIA, SUCCESSFUL. AND SO HE HAD A STEPPING STONE INTO THE PRESIDENCY.
Jimmy: BUT HE'S ALSO AN ACTOR.
HE WAS AND --
Jimmy: DOES THAT FREAK PEOPLE OUT? CAUSE I DON'T EVER REMEMBER HIM GETTING ELECTED. BUT THE PEOPLE GO LIKE --
WE SPENT SOME TIME IN THE BOOK ON HIS FAMOUS MOVIE, "BEDTIME FOR BONZO."
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A SIGNED PICTURE OF REAGAN AND BONZO TOGETHER. SIGNED BY REAGAN.
Jimmy: BONZO WAS A MONKEY, BY THE WAY.
HE'S A MONKEY. I'M SORRY.
Jimmy: AND HE SLEPT WITH THE MONKEY IN THE MOVIE?
HE CLIMBED A TREE WITH THE MONKEY. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY GOT INTIMATE. BUT THEY -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, I MEANT LIKE SLEEPING TOGETHER LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, OH OH!
Jimmy: NO, I DIDN'T. DON'T SPOILER ALERT. [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T SEE THE WHOLE MOVIE. I DIDN'T SEE HIM TUCKING HIM INTO BED. IT LOOKS CUTE, "BEDTIME FOR BONZO."
HE WAS AN ACTOR.
Jimmy: IT WAS AN OVERACTIVE MONKEY?
THE MONKEY WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST SUCCESSES IN HOLLYWOOD, AND DID 60 OR 70 PICTURES.
Jimmy: NO.
YEAH, IT WAS PAID MORE THAN REAGAN. HE WAS TEED OFF.
Jimmy: THE NEXT BOOK IS "KILLING BONZO," RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
HE'S ALREADY DEAD. YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT. MAKE IT A KIDS' BOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS IS A -- I LIKE YOUR BOOKS A LOT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: BUT PEOPLE ARE -- I FIND, ESPECIALLY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, JUST OBSESSED WITH RONALD REAGAN. THEY HAD THE DEBATE AT THE REAGAN LIBRARY.
YES.
Jimmy: WITH THE PLANE, RONALD REAGAN'S PLANE WAS IN THE BACKGROUND.
AIR FORCE ONE. YEP.
Jimmy: WHY DO THEY ALL WANT TO BE RONALD REAGAN?
WELL, RONALD REAGAN'S THE MOST SUCCESSFUL REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IN OUR LIFETIME BY FAR. DWIGHT EISENHOWER WOULD BE SECOND. AND REAGAN NOT ONLY HELPED THE COUNTRY DRAMATICALLY BY BRINGING THE ECONOMY BACK AND STAMPING OUT THE EVIL EMPIRE OF THE SOVIET UNION, BANKRUPTED THEM PRETTY MUCH. BUT HE MADE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE UNITED STATES, AND NOT JUST REPUBLICANS. EVERYBODY FELT GOOD ABOUT THE COUNTRY WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT, ESPECIALLY HIS SECOND TERM. AND HE WORKED WELL WITH TIP O'NEILL, THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE SPEAKER, AND SO HE -- AND HE HAD AN OPTIMISM. AND HE LOVED HIS COUNTRY. REAGAN REALLY LOVED HIS COUNTRY, AND IT CAME THROUGH. AND PEOPLE FELT GOOD ABOUT IT. AND NOW, WE'RE IN THIS PARTISAN WHERE EVERYBODY IS, YOU KNOW, RUNNING EVERYBODY ELSE DOWN. REAGAN WILL GIVE YOU A SHOT OR TWO. I MEAN HE TOOK A COUPLE SHOTS AT MONDALE, AND HE DIDN'T LIKE JIMMY CARTER AT ALL.
Jimmy: NO. DHE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE S WORD. ALL RIGHT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN WE, IT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: REALLY?
HE CALLED CARTER A LITTLE S WORD. DIDN'T LIKE HIM ALL. BUT MONDALE, HE WOULD GIVE YOU A LITTLE LIP, BUT HE WASN'T MEAN SPIRITED AND HE OPERATED MORE ON THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL THEORY.
Jimmy: WHAT CANDIDATE DO YOU THINK IS CLOSEST TO A A RONALD REAGAN?
YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO SAY BECAUSE I KNOW ALL THESE GUYS AND I DON'T EVER INDORSE ANYBODY OR I DON'T FAVOR ANYBODY.
Jimmy: NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THEY ALL WANT TO IMITATE RONALD REAGAN. ALL OF THEM BECAUSE REAGAN IS SO WELL THOUGHT OF IN THIS COUNTRY.
Jimmy: BUT HE ALSO HAS A A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR AS WELL.
REAGAN WAS FUNNY.
Jimmy: HE WAS FUNNY.
AFTER HE WAS SHOT, AND NANCY WAS USHERED TO THE ROOM, BEFORE HE WENT INTO SURGERY, HE GOES, "HONEY, I FORGOT TO DUCK." [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. SO, I MEAN, AND HE'S ON HIS DEATH BED. HE CAME THAT CLOSE TO BEING ASSASSINATED.
Jimmy: I MEAN HOW SCARY IS THAT.
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, HE HAD LINES ABOUT IN THE DEBATES, WHICH WERE WRITTEN FOR HIM, BUT HE DELIVERED THEM EXPERTLY.
Jimmy: DIDN'T HE SAY SOMETHING TO, I READ, TO HIS DOCTOR, HE SAID AS HE WAS GETTING WORKED ON. HE SAID, "I HOPE HE'S A A REPUBLICAN."
YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW, BEFORE HE WENT UNDER, BEFORE THEY PUT HIM UNDER, HE GOES, ARE YOU GUYS REPUBLICANS? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EXACTLY, I WAS JUST MAKING SURE.
LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALWAYS COMING ON. I APPRECIATE THIS.

TOTALLY MAKING NUMBERS UP.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: HERE YOU ARE WRITING AND DIRECTING YOUR FIRST FILM. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: THAT'S A LOT OF WORK.
IT'S SO MUCH WORK.
Jimmy: I MEAN REALLY, WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?
I DON'T KNOW. DIRECTING IS SO MUCH WORK. IT'S SO MUCH HARDER. NO, IT REALLY IS. AND I WILL NEVER ASK A DIRECTOR A DIFFICULT QUESTION AS THE SUN IS DYING DOWN. EVER AGAIN.
Jimmy: EVER AGAIN, YEAH. BECAUSE THAT'S TIME'S A A WASTING.
TIME'S A WASTING AND I HAVE THIS FANTASY THAT MY WIFE AND I WE'RE GONNA BE ON SET AND SHE WOULD ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT HER CHARACTER AND I SAY, WELL I DON'T KNOW. LET'S SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT. BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT EVERY TIME SHE ASKED ME A QUESTION, I JUST SAW A HUGE CLOCK IN FRONT OF HER FACE. [ LAUGHTER ] TICKING.
Jimmy: YOU'RE LIKE, LET'S JUST DO IT. LET'S JUST DO IT ANYWAY. DO IT ANYWAY.
SAY IT! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TRY IT BOTH WAYS. YEAH. SO THAT'S THE OTHER TRICKY THING, YOU'RE DIRECTING YOUR WIFE IN THIS FILM. AS WELL, WAS THAT TOUGH TO DIRECT YOUR WIFE AND THEN GO HOME AND THAT WAS YOUR HOME LIFE.
YOU'VE MET MY WIFE.
Jimmy: I LOVE YOUR WIFE.
YEAH, SHE'S BRILLIANT. JENNIFER CONNELLY, FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW. [ APPLAUSE ] FANTASTIC, TALENTED. SHE'S CURRENTLY IN PENNSYLVANIA RIGHT NOW. SO SHOUT OUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND I KNOW I MARRIED UP. SHE FELL FOR THE ACCENT, TOO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. YEAH. WERE YOU EVER GOING TO BE IN THIS MOVIE? LIKE, YOU WROTE IT.
YEAH, I WAS GOING TO BE -- WELL, I LIED BECAUSE I'M BRITISH, I COULD LIE AND PEOPLE TEND TO THINK IT'S TRUE. AND I SAID, YEAH, I'LL BE IN IT TO TRY AND RAISE SOME SORT OF POULTRY FINANCING FOR IT, AND THEN I FIRED MYSELF, WHICH WAS < MYSELF AS THE ACTOR AND THEN I FIRED MYSELF. SO YEAH.
Jimmy: BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET ALONG WITH YOURSELF?
I JUST, YOU KNOW, WELL, I WOULDN'T PERFORM ON THE CASTING COUCH, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: UNDERSTOOD. UNDERSTOOD. YEAH, YOU TRIED TO SLEEP YOUR WAY INTO THE PART YOU CAN'T GET. ABSOLUTELY.
TERRIBLE.
Jimmy: THE FILM IS CALLED "SHELTER." DO YOU WANT TO SET IT UP IN ANY WAY?
IT'S A FILM, LOOK, LAST YEAR IN NEW YORK CITY, WHERE I HAVE LIVED FOR THE LAST MAYBE 15 YEARS, THE CITY I LOVE. LAST YEAR, WE PASSED TWO HUGE MILESTONES. THE FIRST APARTMENT SOLD FOR A A $100,000,000. EXTRAORDINARY FIGURE.
Jimmy: AN APARTMENT.
ALSO -- YEAH. BUT ALSO 60,000 OF NEW YORK CITY'S RESIDENTS SLEPT IN THE MUNICIPAL SHELTER SYSTEM, EVERY NIGHT. 24,000 OF THOSE PEOPLE TONIGHT WILL BE CHILDREN. AND FOR ME, THAT IS SHOCKING, AND IT'S ALL GOING ON IN A A PLACE, A TOWN HOME TO MORE BILLIONAIRES THAN ANY OTHER CITY ON EARTH. SO THERE'S THIS MOVIE THAT'S TRYING TO BECOME PART OF THE DEBATE AND PART OF THE CONVERSATION.
Jimmy: WHAT COULD PEOPLE DO IF ANYONE'S WATCHING OUT THERE? IS THERE ANY --
WELL, THERE ARE ENORMOUS THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. THAT, YOU KNOW, FOR INSTANCE THERE IS NO RIGHT TO LEGAL COUNSEL, HOUSING COURT. IF YOU'RE A HOMELESS FAMILY, YOU'RE 80% LESS LIKELY TO BE EVICTED FROM A HOUSE IF YOU HAVE LEGAL COUNSEL. LEGAL COUNSEL COSTS UP TO TWELVE AND A HALF THOUSAND DOLLARS, AND THE AVERAGE STAY FOR A HOMELESS FAMILY IS $45,000. SO NOT ONLY IS IT MORALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO, IT IS FISCALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT ALSO, THERE'S AN AMAZING GROUP CALLED THE COALITION FOR HOMELESS. THESE PEOPLE ARE ANGELS. THEY'RE WORKING ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY EVERY DAY. I LOVE THEM. THEY'RE AMAZING PEOPLE. YOU CAN GO ON THEIR WEBSITE, THE COALITION FOR HOMELESS. THERE ARE ABOUT 30 WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THIS, BURNING ISSUE FOR ALL OF US.
Jimmy: VERY NICE. GOOD FOR YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. HERE IS JENNIFER CONNELLY AND ANTHONY MACKIE IN PAUL BETTANY'S NEW MOVIE "SHELTER."
HANNAH.
NOT MUCH, BUT IT'S HOME.
WE NEED TO LEAVE, NOW.
WHY?
IT'S SOMEONE'S HOUSE HANNAH.
BUT THEY'RE NOT USING IT RIGHT NOW.
WHAT?
THEY'RE AT THE BEACH.
WHAT'S HE DOING DOWN?
THEY HAVE KIDS. IT'S SUMMER. THEY'RE RICH. THEY'RE AT THE BEACH, THE HAMPTONS. MAYBE EVEN EUROPE SOMEWHERE.
NO. NO.
DEFINITELY AT THE BEACH.
NO HANNAH, WE CAN'T.
SIT HERE. WE NEED SOMETHING GOOD. THIS IS SOMETHING GOOD.
THIS IS WRONG. IT'S DANGEROUS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
