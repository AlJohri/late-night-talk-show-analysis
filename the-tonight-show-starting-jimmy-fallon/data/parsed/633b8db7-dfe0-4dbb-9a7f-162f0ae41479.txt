Questlove: 232 SIERRA LEONE.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE! HEY, WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME AND THANKS FOR WATCHING AT HOME. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. YESTERDAY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TED CRUZ SAID THAT HE WILL IN FACT BE SIGNING UP FOR OBAMACARE DESPITE SAYING EARLIER THAT HE WANTS TO REPEAL EVERY WORD OF IT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A GOOD THING HE'S SIGNING UP, BECAUSE CRUZ JUST WENT TO THE HOSPITAL IN HYPOCRITICAL CONDITION. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DURING A JOURNALISM AWARDS CEREMONY THIS WEEK HILLARY CLINTON ADMITTED THAT HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESS HAS BEEN COMPLICATED. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, HILLARY REALLY UNDERSTANDS THE RELATIONSHIP STATUS "IT'S COMPLICATED." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] SO I GUESS THAT'S GOOD FOR HER, KIND OF TO GET USED TO THAT. AND I READ THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS SET A NEW RECORD FOR CENSORING INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. YEAH, SET A NEW RECORD. WHEN ASKED TO COMMENT, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION RELEASED THIS STATEMENT. AND IF YOU COULD -- [ LAUGHTER ] THEY MEAN IT. IT'S SERIOUS. [ APPLAUSE ] TOUGH LOVE. TOUGH LOVE. AND GET THIS. A NEW POLL SHOWS THAT TV PRESIDENTS FEATURED ON SHOWS LIKE "THE WEST WING," "24," AND "BATTLESTAR GALACTICA," HAVE A A HIGHER FAVORABILITY RATING THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, COME ON. BUT HE'S NOT THE ONLY POLITICIAN THAT PEOPLE PREFER FICTIONAL CHARACTERS OR TV PERSONALITIES TO. FOR INSTANCE, INSTEAD OF POTENTIAL REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RAND PAUL, PEOPLE PREFER GARFIELD'S OWNER JON ARBUCKLE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I LIKE THEM BOTH THE SAME. NEXT, INSTEAD OF HIS DAD AND FORMER CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL, PEOPLE PREFER MR. MAGOO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] INSTEAD OF TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY, PEOPLE PREFER ANY MALE SOAP OPERA ACTOR OVER 50. [ LAUGHTER ] INSTEAD OF U.S. DIPLOMAT JOHN BOLTON, PEOPLE PREFER WILFRED BRIMLEY. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN HE'S OKAY. AND FINALLY, INSTEAD OF SECRETARY OF ENERGY ERNEST MONIZ, PEOPLE PREFER, AN OOMPA-LOOMPA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHO DOESN'T LOVE A GOOD OOMPA-LOOMPA? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHO DOESN'T LIKE OOMPA-LOOMPAS?
Steve: OOMPA-LOOMPA.
Jimmy: THIS IS TOO BAD, YOU GUYS. TODAY ZAYN MALIK ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS OFFICIALLY LEAVING ONE DIRECTION. [ AUDIENCE AWWS ] THEY ASKED HIM, "WHERE ARE YOU GOING?" HE SAID, "ANOTHER DIRECTION." [ LAUGHTER ] A BUSINESS STORY HERE. IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT KRAFT FOODS IS PLANNING TO MERGE WITH KETCHUP MAKER HEINZ. WHEN ASKED WHY IT TOOK SUCH A A LONG TIME, KRAFT SAID THEY HAD TO TURN HEINZ UPSIDE DOWN AND JUST WAIT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HIT THE BOTTOM? NO, DON'T -- THAT'S RIGHT, KRAFT FOODS AND HEINZ WILL MERGE TO CREATE THE FIFTH LARGEST FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPANY IN THE WORLD. THE MERGER WILL COMBINE BRANDS LIKE KRAFT MAC AND CHEESE, HEINZ KETCHUP, OSCAR MAYER WIENERS, AND PHILADELPHIA CREAM CHEESE. OR AS STONERS PUT IT, "ALREADY DID THAT, BRO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] PRETTY TASTY. PRETTY TASTY SNACK IF I DON'T MIND. [ LAUGHTER ] WOW, I JUST ATE A BATTERY." [ LAUGHTER ]

Steve: NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OR ME. LABORATORIES FOUND THAT CHEAP WINE LIKE FRANZIA ACTUALLY CONTAINS HIGH LEVELS OF ARSENIC. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] THEN PEOPLE WHO BUY BOXES OF FRANZIA WINE WERE LIKE, "STILL HAS ALCOHOL IN IT, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KIDS KEEP IT DOWN BACK THERE!" [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE A GIANT BOX --
Steve: LIKE A TOWER.
Jimmy: LIKE A SPARKLESS THING? [ LAUGHTER ] [ GULPING ] AH. "ALL RIGHT. SECOND HALF OF THE GAME IS STARTING. LET'S GO. COME ON. KICK THAT SOCCER BALL, JOHNNY." [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S A LOCAL STORY. I READ THAT TOYS "R" US MIGHT LEAVE ITS FAMOUS LOCATION IN TIMES SQUARE. [ AUDIENCE AWWS ] APPARENTLY, IT'S HARD TO GET KIDS TO BUY BATMAN AND ELMO IN THE STORE WHEN THEY JUST SAW THEM CHOKING EACH OTHER OUTSIDE ON THE SIDEWALK. "YOU STOLE MY CIGARETTES, YOU SON OF A --" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: "I'LL TICKLE YOU."
Jimmy: "YOU WANT TO TICKLE ME, MAN?" [ LAUGHTER ] I HEARD ABOUT A BRITISH ILLUSTRATOR WHO HAS SOLD OVER 1 MILLION COPIES OF HER COLORING BOOKS THAT ARE AIMED AT ADULTS. IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT A A COLORING BOOK FOR ADULTS LOOKS LIKE, JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS HERE. "DAN SWEARS HE BOUGHT THE BEIGE END TABLE HIS WIFE ASKED FOR, WHILE DIANE ARGUES THAT IT'S TAUPE AND THAT DAN IS AN IDIOT. [ LAUGHTER ] COLOR IT AND PROVE ONE OF THEM RIGHT." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED. I DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED. I HEARD THAT MIKE TYSON HAS BEEN CAST IN AN ACTION MOVIE WHERE HE WILL PLAY A STREET FIGHTER WHO ALSO WORKS IN REAL ESTATE.

YOU CAN'T LEAVE TRASH ALL OVER A HOTEL.
Jimmy: IT WAS THE BIGGEST DEBATE OF YOUR LIFE. I'M LIKE, "WHAT IS GOING ON?" GOSH, IT WAS SO FUNNY.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT PREPARATION --
Jimmy: YOU SHOULD HAVE. YEAH, EXACTLY. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING BUT MAYBE IT CALMS YOU DOWN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT -- AND YOUR SONS ARE SO FUNNY. AND EVERYONE'S JUST MAKING YOU LAUGH AND LIKE RANKING ON YOU AFTER -- THEY'RE LIKE DAD, WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? OH, MY GOSH. YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS DOCUMENTARY. AND I WAS SAYING LIKE -- DO YOU THINK THAT ANY CANDIDATES WILL BE ABLE TO DO A DOCUMENTARY LIKE THAT AND RELEASE IT FOR THIS NEXT -- IN 2016?
IT WOULD BE NICE. I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS TO GET PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY WATCH IT.
Jimmy: NO.
WHO'S GOING TO SPEND AN HOUR AND A HALF WATCHING A A PROMOTIONAL PIECE? BECAUSE YOU KNOW CANDIDATES DO IT FOR THEMSELVES FOR PROMOTION, IT'S GOING TO BE KIND OF SAPPY.
Jimmy: OH I SEE.
THIS WAS DONE BY A A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER. HE FOLLOWED US AROUND. HE EDITED IT. I SAID "LOOK, IF I WIN I GET TO EDIT IT, ALL RIGHT? BUT IF I LOSE YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'LL WEAR A HOT DOG HAT AND I DON'T EVEN CARE, YEAH EXACTLY, YEAH.
SO HE PUT IT TOGETHER, WHICH MADE IT OBVIOUSLY AUTHENTIC AND INTERESTING AND --
Jimmy: I THOUGHT IT WAS -- SP IT WOULDN'T EXIST. THEY WOULDN'T LET -- ALMOST TOO MANY COOKS IN THE KITCHEN.
YEAH IT WOULD JUST BE A A 1 1/2-HOUR AD. AND WHO WANTS TO WATCH THAT?
Jimmy: THAT'S TRUE. SO NOW YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jimmy: I'VE GOT TO SAY WE WERE BUMMED. BECAUSE I HAD THE WIG, THE OUTFIT. I COULD HAVE DONE A SKETCH -- I COULD HAVE DONE A SKETCH EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. YOU UNDERSTAND?
I GOTTA PUT YOU IN SUB FOR ME FOR SOME OF THESE EVENTS.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
WE HAD 20 REPUBLICAN DEBATES LAST TIME. IF WE HAD THAT MANY THIS TIME I COULD HAVE DONE 15 AND HAD YOU DO FIVE.
Jimmy: YEAH -- I COULD DO MORE THAN FIVE. SIX MAYBE. [ LAUGHTER ]
I CAN'T AFFORD --
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT, YEAH, EXACTLY. SO YOU'RE NOT DOING IT. AND SO NOW YOU'RE JUST KIND OF A FREE MAN. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GO AND SUPPORT AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO AND SAY WHATEVER WORDS YOU WANT TO SAY. TED CRUZ IS THE FIRST REPUBLICAN NOMINEE SAYING I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
YEAH. I MEAN HE'S A REMARKABLE SPEAKER. VERY GIFTED, ELOQUENT GUY. AND HE'LL MAKE A BIG IMPRESSION.
Jimmy: ARE WE TOO EARLY? ARE WE TOO EARLY?
NO. I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME FOR FOLKS. JEB BUSH HAS BEEN OUT WORKING SOME OF THE OTHERS AS WELL. I THINK HE'LL HAVE 10 OR 15 PEOPLE ON THE STAGE AT THE FIRST DEBATE. THAT'LL BE EXCITING. YOU'LL SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT VISIONS FOR THE COUNTRY. AND THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IT WILL PROBABLY BE HILLARY AND A A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE HER VP.
Jimmy: SO WHAT'S THE DEAL? IS IT A SHOO-IN? IS IT AUTOMATIC? IS HILLARY CLINTON RUNNING?
JUST LIKE IT WAS IN 2008. THAT WAS THE WAY WE FELT IN 2008, IT WAS A SHOE-IN. SHE WAS GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE AND THERE WAS THIS GUY BARACK OBAMA COMING ALONG, I GAVE HIM A 5% CHANCE. AND HE BECOMES THE NOMINEE AND THE PRESIDENT. SO THIS TIME IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S A SHOE-IN BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. THE E-MAILS, THE --
Jimmy: WHAT'S THE THING ABOUT THE E-MAILS? I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS. SHE HAD PRIVATE E-MAILS? OR YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT?
WELL, THERE ARE FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT IF YOU HAVE KIND OF AN IMPORTANT JOB LIKE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT THE COUNTRY WANTS TO HAVE A RECORD OF WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SAID.
Jimmy: OKAY.
AMONG YOUR PEOPLE AND TO OTHERS BECAUSE THIS IS AFTER ALL THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND SHE DIDN'T KEEP THE RECORDS REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A BIG DEAL.
Jimmy: SHE HAD A PRIVATE E-MAIL.
YEAH. SHE WAS CORRESPONDING WITH HER PEOPLE THROUGH PRIVATE ACCOUNTS, SERVER IN HER OWN HOME. AND I THINK THAT'S A CONCERN ALTHOUGH I THINK THE BIGGER CONCERN WILL BE HER RECORD AS SECRETARY OF STATE. I MEAN THE WORLD HASN'T EXACTLY GOTTEN MORE SAFE AND MORE PROSPEROUS DURING HER TERM, AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A A BIGGER CHALLENGE FOR HER.
Jimmy: REALLY, YEAH, AS YOU
Jimmy: THAT'S AMAZING. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE. SO YOU'RE RAISING ALL THAT MONEY, CHARITY VISION, AND IN THIS CHARITY EVENT YOU'RE DOING MAY 15th YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT EVANDER -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT EVANDER HOLYFIELD.

Jimmy: YOU GREW UP IN NEW JERSEY? BORN AND RAISED?
BORN AND RAISED IN SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY.
Jimmy: WHAT WERE YOU LIKE AS A LITTLE GIRL, A LITTLE GRACE? WERE YOU A TROUBLEMAKER? WERE YOU CREATIVE?
I THREW TEMPER TANTRUMS A A LOT. WHICH I THINK IS JUST BEING CREATIVE WITH YOUR EMOTIONS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S ONE WAY OF PUTTING IT, YEAH.
SO I RATIONALIZE IT FROM MY MOM NOW. MY MOM HAD A REALLY INTERESTING TECHNIQUE FOR DEALING WITH MY TEMPER TANTRUM THROWING. ONE TIME WE WERE AT A GROCERY STORE AND I REALLY WANTED THESE COOKIES, BECAUSE ADVERTISING TOLD ME THESE COOKIES WERE REALLY GREAT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO MY MOM WOULDN'T LET ME HAVE THEM. AND I THREW A HUGE TEMPER TANTRUM. I THINK I WAS LIKE 6 YEARS OLD. AND I GRABBED HER HAIR AND RIPPED A CHUNK OF HER HAIR OUT. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] LOOK, I WAS JUST EXPRESSING MY CREATIVITY.
Jimmy: NO, GRACE.
I'M MUCH BETTER NOW. I'M BETTER NOW BECAUSE SHE -- MY MOM'S THE NICEST WOMAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD. SHE, AFTER THE GROCERY STORE, DROVE ME AND MY TWO BROTHERS DIRECTLY TO THE POLICE STATION. AND SHE SAT US THERE AND SHE POINTED AT THE POLICE STATION AND SHE SAID, "THIS IS WHERE BAD KIDS GO." [ LAUGHTER ] AND LIKE AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL WALKING INTO THE STATION. AND I JUST REMEMBER STARING AT HER FROM THE CAR BEING LIKE, I WILL NEVER BE A BAD KID, OH MY GOD. YEAH, IT WAS LIKE AN ABBREVIATED "SCARED STRAIGHT" PROGRAM.
Jimmy: I REMEMBER "SCARED STRAIGHT." OH MY GOSH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I REMEMBER SEEING THAT AS A KID AND I WAS FRIGHTENED AS WELL.
YEAH, I WAS REALLY SCARED STRAIGHT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOW ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.
YEAH. NO HAIR PULLING.
Jimmy: YOU STARTED ON YOUTUBE WHERE YOU WERE DOING YOUR OWN VLOG, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: "IT'S GRACE." SUPER FUNNY.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND IT'S REALLY GREAT. AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF FANS. AND NOW YOU GET OFFERED A SHOW ON E!.
IT'S JUST THAT EASY.
Jimmy: I MEAN, COME ON. EVEN YOU CAN DO IT AT HOME. BUT LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE GROWING OUT OF YOUTUBE NOW. WHAT'S THE SHOW GOING TO BE LIKE IF WE TUNE IN?
SO MANY THINGS. IT'S GOING TO BE -- I KEEP CALLING IT LIKE "A CURIOUS INTROVERT'S NIGHTTIME TALK SHOW." IT'S GOING TO TAKE PLACE IN A A HOUSE AND NOT IN FRONT OF A A STUDIO AUDIENCE. I'M VERY SORRY TO OFFEND ANY OF YOU OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. [ AUDIENCE GROANS ] YEAH, SORRY.
Jimmy: LIKE YOU ALL WOULD'VE WENT THERE. WHERE DO YOU FILM?
IN LOS ANGELES. YOU WANT TO COME TO LOS ANGELES?
Jimmy: WE COULD. [ CHEERS ] I MEAN WE COULD -- WE COULD ALL TRAVEL, YEAH.
WE'LL ALL TALK COLLECTIVELY AFTER THIS.
Jimmy: OKAY THAT'S PERFECT, YEAH. SO NO STUDIO AUDIENCE.
YEAH, NO STUDIO AUDIENCE.
Jimmy: INTERESTING.
I REALLY WANTED IT TO BE A A SHOW WHERE PEOPLE CAN HANG IN WITH ME ON A FRIDAY NIGHT AND WHERE PEOPLE -- I CAN GO ONLINE AND ASK FOR SUGGESTIONS. ASK FOR THINGS THAT SHOULD BE IN THE HOUSE, WAYS I SHOULD SAY GOOD-BYE ON THE SHOW, QUESTIONS I SHOULD ASK GUESTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. MAKE IT FEEL LIKE EVERYONE IS MAKING THIS TOGETHER. IT'S NOT JUST ME AND A A PRODUCTION COMPANY SAYING, "HERE WATCH THIS NOW. THIS IS OUR ART. LOOK AT IT."
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT THIS IS A VERY INTERACTIVE SHOW.
HOPEFULLY.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT. I THINK IT'S A COOL IDEA. I LOVE IT.
I THINK IT -- WE'LL SEE, IT'S A TOTAL EXPERIMENT.
Jimmy: WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU, PAL. GRACE HELBIG EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
