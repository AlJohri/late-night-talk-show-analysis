Jimmy: OH! OH! RIGHT BACK AT YA, GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD RIGHT HERE! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE CROWD WE LOVE! THIS IS THE CROWD WE LOVE. LOOKING GOOD, LOOKING SHARP. THANK YOU, GUYS. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE IT'S THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT, THE CANDIDATES ARE REALLY STARTING TO GO AFTER EACH OTHER NOW. IN FACT, DONALD TRUMP TOOK A SHOT AT RICK PERRY ON TWITTER YESTERDAY AND SAID HE SHOULD BE FORCED TO TAKE AN IQ TEST BEFORE BEING ALLOWED TO ENTER THE GOP DEBATES TO WHICH PERRY RESPONDED, "I'D GLADLY TAKE AN IQ TEST, JUST TELL ME WHICH CUP TO PEE IN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DONALD TRUMP, I MEAN HE -- TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN HAS SURPRISED A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE HE'S ACTUALLY STARTING TO LEAD IN THE POLLS. HE'S EVEN RAISED ABOUT $100,000 IN DONATIONS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, WHICH RAISES A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION, WHO IS GIVING DONALD TRUMP MONEY? [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S LIKE GIVING YOUR MONEY TO A PILE OF MONEY. LIKE, THROW MONEY AT MONEY. YEAH. SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS WEIGHING IN ON DONALD TRUMP. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, JOHN McCAIN ADDRESSED TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN RALLY IN ARIZONA AND SAID THAT HE JUST QUOTE, "FIRED UP THE CRAZIES." [ LAUGHTER ] NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH TRUMP'S SHOW "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE" WHERE HE JUST FIRES THE CRAZIES. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY MSNBC HOST LAWRENCE O'DONNELL SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP LIED WHEN HE SAID THAT HE MADE $20 MILLION A YEAR OFF HIS APPRENTICE SERIES ON NBC. YEAH. NBC ALSO DENIED TRUMP'S CLAIM SAYING, "WE DON'T HAVE $20 MILLION." [ LAUGHTER ] TRUMP'S NOT THE ONLY ONE MAKING NEWS THIS WEEK. SCOT WALKER HELD HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN EVENT AT A HARLEY-DAVIDSON DEALERSHIP IN LAS VEGAS. HE BRAGGED ABOUT RIDING A MOTORCYCLE. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT OF WALKER ON HIS HARLEY. CHECK THIS OUT. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK HE'S IN THE GANG HELL'S NERDS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LOOK AT HIM. HE LOOKS LIKE THE GUY IN THE GANG THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS IS AN UNDERCOVER COP. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW HE'S LIKE, "LET'S GO BACK TO THE CLUBHOUSE. TELL ME ALL YOUR SECRETS." I SAW THAT JEB BUSH RELEASED A NEW CAMPAIGN VIDEO WHERE HE TALKS ABOUT HIS FAVORITE TECH ACCESSORIES AND SAYS THAT HE PREFERS THE APPLE WATCH OVER APPLE PIE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AS LONG AS YOU PUT ICE CREAM ON THEM, CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID HE'LL EAT BOTH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: FORGET ABOUT IT.

Jimmy: THEY DRINK THAT UP IN SPACE.
Steve: MM-HMM. THAT'S VERY SMOOTH.
Jimmy: OH. THIS IS PRETTY BIG HERE. PRESIDENT OBAMA BECAME THE FIRST SITTING PRESIDENT TO VISIT A FEDERAL PRISON YESTERDAY. YEAH. OBAMA SAID IT WAS A GOOD CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT PRISON REFORM AND TO CATCH UP WITH SO MANY FORMER CONGRESSMEN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "YOU LOOK GOOD, LARRY! YOU'VE LOST SOME WEIGHT, YOU LOOK GREAT! YEAH, LOOK AT HIM." CRAZY TECH NEWS HERE. RESEARCHERS HERE IN NEW YORK CREATED A ROBOT THAT ACTUALLY PASSED A SELF- AWARENESS TEST. SO IF YOU'RE KEEPING SCORE, THAT'S ROBOTS ONE, DONALD TRUMP ZERO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF ROBOTS I SAW THAT A NEW HOTEL IN JAPAN, THIS IS REAL, HAS ACTUALLY REPLACED ITS RECEPTIONISTS WITH ROBOTS TO CUT DOWN ON COSTS. AND THEY'RE SAYING IT'S THE FUTURE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. CHECK THIS OUT. THIS IS REAL. [ SPEAKING JAPANESE ]
WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE HENN NA HOTEL. IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IN, PLEASE PRESS ONE. [ SPEAKING JAPANESE ]

Jimmy: CHECK THIS OUT. AFTER MORE THAN 25 YEARS, THE GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS SIGNED A BILL THIS WEEK THAT OVERTURNED A STATEWIDE BAN ON HAPPY HOUR DRINK SPECIALS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHEN ASKED WHY HE OVERTURNED IT, HE WAS LIKE, "I DIDN'T, YOUR MOM OVERTURNED IT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GET IT TOGETHER, BUDDY. "CAN I HAVE ANOTHER SLIPPERY NIPPLE?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I READ THAT TWO TEENAGERS IN UTAH WERE CAUGHT STEALING TUBS OF ICE CREAM FROM A TRUCK AFTER THEY BROADCAST THE ENTIRE ROBBERY THROUGH THE STREAMING APP PERISCOPE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THE COPS WHO CAUGHT THEM GOT ARRESTED FOR WATCHING TEENAGERS ON PERISCOPE. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, "HEY STAN, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND? HOW DID YOU CATCH THESE KIDS AGAIN?" "I FOLLOW THESE TEENAGERS ON PERISCOPE." [ LAUGHTER ] ODD THING TO DO. FINALLY, THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD. I HEARD THAT A WOMAN ON ETSY IS SELLING HANDMADE FUR CLOTHING FOR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. THAT SHE BELIEVES IT'S MORE ETHICAL BECAUSE IT'S MADE FROM ROADKILL. WHEN ASKED HOW SHE GETS THE ROADKILL, THE WOMAN WAS LIKE, "OH, I RUN THEM OVER WITH MY CAR." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW!

WE FOUND SOME AMAZING PEOPLE. WE SHOW UP AT THEIR DOOR. THEY DON'T KNOW WE'RE COMING, AND WE DO SOMETHING WONDERFUL, HOPEFULLY FOR THEM, SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

SO THINGS LIKE THAT. THEN WE'RE GONNA DO -- THERE'S A GAME WE'RE GONNA PLAY WHERE we HAVE TWO ARMORED TRUCKS. AND THERE'S THIS FAMILY THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT, AND THEY'RE A GREAT FAMILY. AND WE WANT TO CELEBRATE THEM. WE'RE GONNA BRING UP TWO ARMORED TRUCKS ON THE STREET, PARK THEM BOTH. ONE'S LOADED WITH CASH. ONE'S LOADED WITH CONFETTI. KNOCK ON THE DOOR. SAY, "COME OUT LIVE."

I WENT ON STAGE BECAUSE I WAS JUST LIKE, MALE BRAVADO. IT'S EITHER YOU GO UP, OR YOU GUYS ARE ALL SCAREDY-CATS. SO I WENT UP AND I JUST SPOKE. JUST SPOKE AND SPOKE SOME MORE AND PEOPLE LAUGHED. AND SO I CARRIED ON AND THEY LAUGHED SOME MORE. AND THAT WAS IT, AND I'VE BEEN DOING THAT EVER SINCE. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I JUST TALK AND THEN -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN WHEN THE PEOPLE STOP LAUGHING I'LL JUST WAVE AND GO HOME. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S MY PLAN.

AND THEN EVERYONE JUST STANDS THERE STUNNED. YOU GO, "WHAT HAPPENS?" BECAUSE I'M A FAN OF THE SHOW. YOU KNOW? EVERYONE IS A FAN OF IT AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THEN THEY GO, "WHO'S GOING TO BE THE HOST?" AND I'M LIKE, "YEAH, WHO IS GOING TO BE THE HOST?" AND THEN IT SLOWLY GETS TURNED ON YOU. AND YOU'RE LIKE, "I'M GOING TO BE -- BE THE HOST?" OKAY. AND THEN YOU, YEAH. AND THEN YOU COME TO GRIPS WITH IT. AND JON WAS LIKE, "GO FORTH, KID." AND HE GAVE ME A LITTLE MAGIC PEN AND WAS LIKE, "THIS PEN WILL KEEP YOU SAFE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
IT'S A NORMAL PEN, BUT I BELIEVED IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST -- HAS HE GIVEN YOU ADVICE?
HE HAS, MAN.
Jimmy: JON IS A GREAT GUY.
JON HAS SOME GREAT ADVICE AND SOME OF IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND, BUT I JUST NOD. YOU KNOW, WHEN SMART PEOPLE TELL YOU THINGS, JUST KIND OF LIKE, MM-HMM. [ LAUGHTER ] SO YEAH. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HE SAID WAS, JUST SAID "MAN, JUST GO OUT THERE AND HAVE FUN. DO THE BEST SHOW THAT YOU FEEL YOU CAN DO AND THE SHOW YOU FEELS NEEDS TO BE DONE." SO, YOU KNOW. WE AGREE ON MANY TOPICS AND WE COME TO IT FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE FUNNY AND HAVE FUN. LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE, YOU KNOW?

THIS IS INSANE. I'VE NEVER SEEN -- I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: "STREET FIGHTER."
IT'S LIKE WHO DO YOU SELECT?
Jimmy: LIKE "STREET FIGHTER," YEAH.
IT'S CRAZY. BERNIE SANDERS VERSUS -- [ LAUGHTER ] DONALD TRUMP.
Jimmy: IT IS CRAZY, THE CHARACTERS. IT'S INSANE.
INSANE. IT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING I'VE EVER -- I'M EXCITED FOR IT. I'M REALLY, YOU KNOW? I'M EXCITED. I FEEL LIKE IT'S LIKE "GAME OF THRONES" NOW. THAT WE NEED LIKE A MAP TO SHOW YOU WHO GOES WHERE AND THE HOW IS THE HOUSE OF BUSH AND THEN THE HOUSE, LIKE -- BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
Jimmy: NO, YEAH.

THANK YOU. NEW YORK CITY, THAT'S WHERE I AM, RIGHT? DO YOU GUYS EVER TAKE THE DAY OFF FROM BEING NEW YORK CITY? YOU CAN'T. YOU HAVE TO BE NEW YORK ALL THE TIME. YOU GUYS ARE NAILING IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M ORIGINALLY FROM MISSISSIPPI. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S TOO LATE. TOO LATE. BUT PLEASE BE SEATED. [ LAUGHTER ] I AM ORIGINALLY FROM MISSISSIPPI.

BUT REALLY, PLEASE BE SEATED. I HAVE TO GET THROUGH MY SET, AND ALL THESE STANDING OVATIONS ARE AWKWARD. [ LAUGHTER ] I INVITED HER DOWN TO MY HOMETOWN TO SPEND THE HOLIDAYS WITH ME AND MY EXTENDED FAMILY. AND BEFORE THE TRIP SHE SAID, "NO OFFENSE, BUT" -- AND I SAID, "YES, WHAT IS THIS FLATTERING THING YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE SAID, "WHEN I PICTURE PEOPLE FROM MISSISSIPPI, I PICTURE THEM BAREFOOT." [ LAUGHTER ] I SAID, "OH, THANK YOU." I SAID, "I GET IT, BUT MY FAMILY IS CIVILIZED." [ LAUGHTER ] THEY HAVE HOMES AND JOBS AND SHOES. BUT I HEAR YOU. SO I WENT DOWN THERE BEFORE SHE ARRIVED, AND I WAS HANGING OUT WITH MY FAMILY. AND SHE WAS GOING TO FLY IN AND MEET US. AND THE AIRPORT THAT YOU FLY INTO TO GO TO MY TOWN IS NEW ORLEANS. AND SO MY ENTIRE FAMILY PILES INTO A VAN. OH, SURE. NOW YOU LAUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] SO WE DRIVE INTO NEW ORLEANS TO JUST HANG OUT AND KILL TIME UNTIL SHE ARRIVES. AND WE'RE IN THE FRENCH QUARTER THERE. AND I FINALLY SAID, "OH, YOU KNOW, SHE'S GOING TO BE LANDING SOON SO WE BETTER HEAD OUT." AND ALL 11 OF THEM, THEY PILE BACK INTO THE VAN, AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW, BUT IT'S LEGAL DOWN THERE TO HAVE OPEN CONTAINERS WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING. THEY ALL PILE IN WITH THEIR BEERS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY ALSO ICE DOWN A COOLER WITH EXTRA BEER JUST FOR THE DRIVE TO THE AIRPORT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I DESIGNATED MYSELF THE SOBER DRIVER. NOT THAT ANYBODY IN MY FAMILY CARED EITHER WAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY WERE JUST LIKE, "OKAY, NERD." [ LAUGHTER ] GOT TO GET EVERYONE THERE SAFELY. SO, WE DRIVE IN. I PARK THE VAN CURBSIDE AT BAGGAGE CLAIM. I GET OUT, I SAY, "EVERYBODY WAIT HERE." [ LAUGHTER ] I GO IN. I'M GONE TWO MINUTES. WE'RE WALKING OUT, CHATTING. SHE LOOKS UP -- [ LAUGHTER ] SHE SAYS, "IS THAT YOUR FAMILY?" [ LAUGHTER ] I LOOK UP. AND ALL 11 OF THEM HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THE VAN. THEY'RE SMOKING, DRINKING, WAVING WILDLY, SO EXCITED TO MEET HER. THEY'VE PULLED THE COOLER OUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] CURBSIDE AT BAGGAGE CLAIM. I WAS GONE TWO MINUTES. AND THEY WERE BAREFOOT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AFTER SPENDING THE DAY IN THE FRENCH QUARTER, THEY'D ALL TAKEN THEIR SHOES OFF IN THE DRIVE JUST TO THE AIRPORT. AND SO THERE I WAS HAVING TO SAY, YES, THAT IS MY CIVILIZED FAMILY THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT. ANYWAY, THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

WE WENT IN, AND YOU'RE LIKE, "THIS IS THE BEST" -- NOW I'M STARTING TO WONDER IF THIS WAS YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S NOT BEEN ONE SIGN OF RECOGNITION ON YOUR PART. THROUGH THIS WHOLE STORY, YOU'RE NOT LIKE, "OH, YEAH YEAH. I REMEMBER HANGING OUT WITH NICK." THERE'S NOTHING. SO WE GO INTO THIS BAR, AND THEN YOU SAID, "OH, THE BEST PART IS THERE'S A JUKE BOX IN THE BASEMENT," LIKE, IN AN AREA THIS BIG. AND I WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND, LIKE, GROSS LIQUID WAS DRIPPING ON MY HEAD AND WE WERE JUST LISTENING TO A JUKE BOX IN THE BASEMENT. THAT SOUNDS NOT FAMILIAR AT ALL TO YOU.
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT FUN SO FAR? THIS IS A GREAT -- IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING I WOULD DO.
AND THEN I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU TOOK US TO THIS AWESOME BAR YOU LOVED. AND THEN WE WERE AT THIS OTHER BAR UNTIL 6:00 IN THE MORNING. THEY GAVE US A LITTLE ROPED-OFF AREA SO NOBODY WOULD BOTHER US. WE WERE THERE UNTIL 6:00 IN THE MORNING. I'M FRIENDS WAS NICK SWARDSON. I'M DONE WITH YOU GUYS. I'M READY TO HEAD OUT. I SAID, "GOOD NIGHT." NICK WAS JUST LIKE, "YEAH, LATER." AND YOU WERE LIKE, "WELL, LET ME WALK YOU OUT." YOU WALKED ME THROUGH THIS CROWDED BAR, HAILED ME A CAB, SENT ME ON MY WAY. NEVER TO REMEMBER MY FACE AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S TOO LATE!
Jimmy: I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT TOO LATE.
IT'S TOO LATE.
