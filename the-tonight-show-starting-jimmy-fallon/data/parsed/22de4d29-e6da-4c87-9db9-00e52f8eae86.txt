OF COURSE, A BIG INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA. FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY CONFIRMED THE AGENCY IS EXAMINING POSSIBLE TIES BETWEEN RUSSIA AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN. WHEN ASKED IF THEY FOUND ANYTHING YET, COMEY SAID, I CAN'T COMMENT ON AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HOWEVER, COMEY REFUSED TO SAY WHETHER TRUMP HIMSELF WAS BEING INVESTIGATED. IT'S PART OF HIS POLICY NOT TO COMMENT ON ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS THAT DON'T INVOLVE HILLARY CLINTON, AND -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND ANYTHING ELSE, I CAN'T TALK ABOUT. ABSOLUTELY OFF LIMITS. AS YOU EXPECT A LOT OF MATERIAL TO GO THROUGH. AND COMEY SAID THERE'S NO TIMETABLE FOR WHEN THE FBI WILL FINISH. THEN PUTIN SAID, "IT'S LIKE 'GREY'S ANATOMY' OF INVESTIGATION. WHEN YOU THINK IT WILL END IT DOES NOT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] A BIG "GREY'S ANATOMY" FAN.
Steve: APPARENTLY.
Jimmy: IN THE MEAN TIME, TRUMP'S KEEPING BUSY. TODAY HE SIGNED A BILL AUTHORIZING NEARLY $20 BILLION IN FUNDING FOR NASA, YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS THEY FIND A WAY TO PROJECT HIS FACE ON TO THE MOON.
Steve: THAT'S ALL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S ALL. AND LAST NIGHT TRUMP HELD A A RALLY IN KENTUCKY AND HE GAVE A SHOUT-OUT TO THE STATE'S LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, JEANINE HAMPTON. NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING HERE. HE WAS EITHER TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING TO HER, OR BLOW HER A A KISS. I DON'T KNOW. JUST WATCH THIS.

[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TRUMP ALSO RESPONDED TO PEOPLE SAYING HE HASN'T GOTTEN ENOUGH DONE SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE. CHECK OUT WHAT HE SAID.
SOMEBODY SAID TO ME, "WHEN ARE YOU STARTING ON NAFTA?" I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE. I DID THIS, THIS, THIS. I'VE BEEN HERE, LIKE, 51 DAYS. GIVE ME A CHANCE! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TURNS OUT TRUMP'S REALLY BEEN IN OFFICE FOR 60 DAYS NOT 51, AND HE ACTUALLY CORRECTED HIMSELF. KIND OF.
DO NOT WORRY, WE ARE STARTING ON NAFTA VERY SOON. YOU KNOW, I'VE ONLY BEEN THERE FOR WHAT? 52, DAYS, RIGHT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
