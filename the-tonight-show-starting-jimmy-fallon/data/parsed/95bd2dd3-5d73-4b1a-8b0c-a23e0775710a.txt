WELL, IT WAS A SONG CALLED "LOVE ME", YOU KNOW. ♪ TREAT ME LIKE A FOOL TREAT ME MEAN AND CRUEL ♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, I LOVE THAT SONG. DID YOU EVER GET TO MEET ELVIS?
NO, WE MET ONCE IN L.A. HE WANTED TO KNOW WHO WAS THIS BUNCH OF GUYS WHO WAS SELLING TICKETS FASTER THAN HIM, FASTER THAN ELVIS, SO WE DID GET TO MEET HIM AND HE WAS VERY CHARMING AND VERY AFFABLE AND VERY FUNNY. YOU KNOW, AND UH, HE GOT HIS WORLD RIGHT DOWN THEN.
Jimmy: HE DID YEAH.
AND THE GUY SAID TO HIM, WHEN WE DO SOUND CHECKS, PLANT SAID HE WANTS TO SING YOUR SONGS AND SAID, WELL, WHICH SONGS DO YOU SING? AND I TOLD HIM THAT ONE. SO, WE SPENT ABOUT AN HOUR OR TWO WITH HIM. WE WERE LEAVING, WALKING DOWN THE CORRIDOR, I MET HIM. AND I'M TALLER THAN HIM. [LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT IS THE BEST. THAT IS -- THAT IS THE FACEBOOK OF THE '70s. I'M SO HAPPY THAT PERSON GOT FAT.
AND THEN HE SWUNG AROUND THE DOOR OF THE CORRIDOR AND JUST STARTED SINGING TO ME, SO THE TWO OF US ARE DOING ELVIS TO EACH OTHER IN THE CORRIDOR OF THE MOTEL 6 OR WHATEVER IT IS. YEAH.
Jimmy: NO WAY.
AND IT WAS AMAZING. JUST, I COULD HAVE PACKED UP THEN, QUIT AND GONE HOME AND SAID, OKAY, NOW, YOU KNOW, BACK TO GARDENING.
Jimmy: YEAH, BACK TO GARDENING. I ALWAYS WANT TO DO A SONG WITH YOU OR SOMETHING WITH YOU. WOULD YOU BE UP FOR THAT? TRY SOMETHING?
YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
