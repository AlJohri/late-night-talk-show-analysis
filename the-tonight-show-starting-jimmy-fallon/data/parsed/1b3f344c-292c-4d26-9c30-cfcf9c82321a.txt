Jimmy: OH, HI! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LOOKING GOOD, SOUNDING GOOD. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. THIS IS THE SHOW TO BE AT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BIG FUN SHOW TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. LAST NIGHT, ON "60 MINUTES," DONALD TRUMP GAVE HIS FIRST TV INTERVIEW SINCE BEING ELECTED AND GET THIS, HE SAID THAT HE WILL ONLY TAKE $1 A YEAR AS PRESIDENT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ALL PART OF TRUMP'S UNENDING COMMITMENT TO NEVER PAY TAXES. HE'S JUST NOT GOING TO DO IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOT GOING TO DO IT. TRUMP SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE STANDARD $400,000 SALARY THAT PRESIDENTS GET. THAT STORY AGAIN, TRUMP MADE HIS FIRST DEAL AS PRESIDENT ELECT AND LOST ALMOST $400,000. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ALREADY. OF COURSE, TRUMP'S "60 MINUTES" INTERVIEW COVERED A BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS. BUT FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T SEE IT, HERE'S A RECAP.
MOST AMAZING, TREMENDOUS, TERRIFIC. VERY SMART, VERY NICE, TERRIFIC. INCREDIBLE, TREMENDOUS, VERY, VERY GOOD. VERY STRONG, VERY CONFIDENT, VERY WARM. VERY NICE. THAT WAS SO GREAT.
UNBELIEVABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: VERY GOOD. THAT'S WHAT THE NEXT FOUR STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESSES WILL BE. THE UNION'S TERRIFIC. IT'S VERY GREAT. IT'S REALLY FANTASTIC. THE END. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] VERY GOOD. VERY GOOD. GET THIS. I READ THAT AFTER DONALD TRUMP MET WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, TRUMP SEEMED SURPRISED BY THE SCOPE OF THE PRESIDENT'S DUTIES. [ LAUGHTER ] TRUMP SAID, "WHO KNEW?" AND HILLARY WAS LIKE, "I DID." [ LAUGHTER ] "I KNEW. I KNEW EXACTLY." [ APPLAUSE ] SO, I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE THAT AFTER THE MEETING, TRUMP SAID THAT HE WOULD SEEK OBAMA'S ADVICE IN THE FUTURE. WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S ALREADY STARTED. JUST LISTEN TO THESE HACKED VOICE MESSAGES THAT HE LEFT ON OBAMA'S PHONE. WE GOT AN EXCLUSIVE. HERE AT THE TONIGHT SHOW.
Steve: WOW. HOW DID YOU GET THESE?
Jimmy: I CAN'T -- CAN'T REVEAL MY SOURCES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: THESE ARE VOICE MESSAGES THAT HE LEFT ON OBAMA'S PHONE.
Steve: WOW. [ PHONE RINGING ]
HELLO, YOU'VE REACHED PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE BEEP. [ BEEP ]
HEY, BARACK. QUICK QUESTION, SHOULD I GIVE SARA PALIN A CABINET POSITION? WHAT ABOUT DON JR.? 'CAUSE IF I GIVE HIM A POSITION AND I DON'T GIVE ONE TO ERIC, THE HOLIDAYS ARE GOING TO SUCK. [ LAUGHTER ] HIT ME BACK, BO. [ BEEP ] YO, BARACK, YOU KNOW LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR DOG, BO, AT THE WHITE HOUSE? DO I NEED TO GET A PET? HAS ANYBODY PRESIDENT EVER HAD A FULLY GROWN BENGAL TIGER? WOULD LOVE TO BE THE FIRST. [ BEEP ] HI, BARRY, WANT TO MAKE SURE IF IT'S COOL IF WE PAVED OVER MICHELLE'S VEGETABLE GARDEN AND PUT IN A PUTTING GREEN? I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING YOU PROBABLY WANTED TO DO ANYWAY. I'M GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. [ LAUGHTER ] DISREGARD. [ BEEP ] DUDE, SERIOUSLY I'M STARTING TO FREAK OUT ABOUT THIS GIG.

[ APPLAUSE ] HIS FRIENDS GOT HIM A CAKE, WHICH WAS NICE UNTIL QUEEN ELIZABETH POPPED OUT OF IT AND SHOUTED, "STILL HERE!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] COME ON. DON'T RUB IT IN. THIS IS PRETTY COOL. APPLE JUST RELEASED A NEW APP THAT LETS YOU READ BOOKS WITH YOUR KIDS ON YOUR TV. OR AS DADS PUT IT, YEAH, THIS BOOK IS ABOUT THE PATRIOTS/SEAHAWKS GAME. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S A THRILLER. I READ ABOUT A SET OF QUINTUPLETS IN MICHIGAN WHO ALL WORK AT THE SAME McDONALD'S. OR AS THEIR MANAGER PUT IT, "CARL IS THE SINGLE MOST PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYEE I'VE EVER SEEN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, ONE MINUTE, HE'S AT THE FRY MACHINE, NEXT HE'S AT THE REGISTER. HE'S UNBELIEVABLE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HE'S THE BEST.
Jimmy: HE'S THE BEST. CARL, EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH FOR AT LEAST THE LAST FIVE MONTHS. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS, BUT SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT RATS ACTUALLY ENJOY BEING TICKLED. AND EVEN HAVE THEIR OWN VERSION OF LAUGHING. SCIENTISTS HAVE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS DISCOVERY, WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS LIKE, "HOW'S THAT ZIKA CURE COMING ALONG?" [ LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU STILL TICKLING RATS? THAT'S GOOD. THEY HAVE SENSES OF HUMOR? YEAH, ZIKA, DUDE. FOCUS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I THINK RATS WOULD REALLY LIKE NETFLIX IF THEY COULD UNDERSTAND ENGLISH.
