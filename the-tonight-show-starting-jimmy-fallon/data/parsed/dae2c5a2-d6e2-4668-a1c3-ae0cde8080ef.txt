Jimmy: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FOOTBALL GAMES LAST NIGHT. WELL, EVENTUALLY, WE SHOULD, RIGHT?
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I MEAN, ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT I ASKED YOU A A SPORTS QUESTION? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?
LOVE KATE HUDSON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO. WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT KATE HUDSON.
MY BAD. WHERE'S THE PANDA?
Jimmy: NO, NO. THE PANDA'S ON A STRETCHER RIGHT NOW. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
DON'T YOU FIND IT INTERESTING, THOUGH, THAT PEYTON MANNING'S NAME IS NOW "39-YEAR-OLD PEYTON MANNING"? HIS AGE IS ATTACHED TO HIS NAME. SO FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS IT WILL BE "39-YEAR-OLD PEYTON MANNING."
Jimmy: THAT'S INTERESTING.
NOBODY SAYS, "26-YEAR-OLD CAM NEWTON." RIGHT?
Jimmy: THEY DON'T MENTION THAT. THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S A GIANT GAP.
IT'S THE LARGEST GAP WE'VE EVER HAD FOR STARTING QUARTERBACKS IN THE SUPER BOWL.
Jimmy: THIS DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.
IT IS, I MEAN, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
Jimmy: 39, THAT'S THE OLDEST, RIGHT?
YES, IT IS. THE PREVIOUS OLDEST QUARTERBACK WAS PEYTON'S BOSS, JOHN ELWAY.
Jimmy: WERE YOU SURPRISED BY THE OUTCOMES YESTERDAY?
I WAS A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED WITH DENVER. CAROLINA'S GREAT. IT'S JUST THEY PLAY IN CAROLINA. FOR SOME REASON, BECAUSE THEY'RE IN CAROLINA, WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE FORMIDABLE. IF THEY PLAYED IN PHILADELPHIA OR NEW YORK, WE WOULD HAVE A A DIFFERENT FEELING ABOUT THEM. BUT THAT'S A SOLID, YOU KNOW, WELL-ROUNDED TEAM. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE THE FAVORITES IN THE SUPER BOWL.
Jimmy: AND CAM NEWTON, HOW GREAT IS THAT GUY?
LOVE HIM.
Jimmy: HE'S KIND OF A A SHOO-IN, I THINK, FOR MVP, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: HE HAS TO BE.
BUT YOU REMIND ME OF THE CAM NEWTON OF "LATE NIGHT."
Jimmy: WOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU.
BUT, OKAY. NOW, HEAR ME OUT HERE. LENO AND LETTERMAN, MANNING/BRADY. YOU'RE THE NEXT WAVE, ENERGETIC, DIFFERENT, NEW, EXCITING. [ CHEERS ] RIGHT? [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: I LIKE HOW HE DANCES. ALL RIGHT, I LIKE THAT. I'LL TAKE THAT ALL THE WAY, MAN. I LOVED IT, YEAH.
I LOOKED THROUGH ALL YOUR NOTED.
Jimmy: THAT'S ALL MY NOTES. I KNOW. BUT I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. WE DON'T NEED THE NOTES. LET'S TALK ABOUT KATE HUDSON. I MEAN, SHE'S JUST AMAZING, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
SHE WAS VERY NICE. I WILL SAY, A GREAT KISSER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU SAY THAT EVERY TIME YOU COME ON, NO MATTER WHO IS HERE.
I KNOW. JOSH BROLIN WAS ON LAST TIME.
Jimmy: AND DANNY DeVITO BEFORE THAT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. "THE DAN PATRICK SHOW" IS GOING ON THE ROAD, GOING TO THE SUPER BOWL. YOU'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE THE BOYS WITH YOU, TAKE THE RADIO SHOW WITH YOU?
YEAH, THE DANETTES ARE GOING OUT TO SAN FRANCISCO. SO WE'RE OUT THERE, HAVING A A LITTLE FUN.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER YOUR SHOW? YOU END AT 12:00 NOON, RIGHT?
IT WILL BE 9:00 PACIFIC TIME.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. SO 9:00 IN THE MORNING, YOU GOT THE WHOLE DAY.
WE DRINK. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: THERE'S NO WAY.
NO. WE START AT 10:00, NOT AT 9:00.
Jimmy: THAT'S CORRECT. LEGALLY THAT'S AS EARLY AS YOU CAN START.
BUT I GOT A CHANCE TO BRING MY KIDS TO A SUPER BOWL, FINALLY. AND I BROUGHT THEM -- IT WAS CAROLINA AGAINST THE PATRIOTS. I HAD TO WORK, SO I GOT THEM GREAT SEATS. AND THEN, I COULDN'T WAIT TO CATCH UP WITH THEM AFTER. DRAMATIC FINISH, PATRIOTS WIN IT. SO I SEE MY DAUGHTER, AND I SAID, "HOW WAS IT?" SHE SAID, "AWESOME." I SAID, "DID YOU TAKE PICTURES?" AND SHE SAID, "YES." I SAID, "WELL, WHAT DO YOU HAVE?" SHE SAID, "WELL, THAT'S JIMMY. HE HAD A HOT DOG. IT DIDN'T STAY DOWN LONG." [ LAUGHTER ] "THAT GUY, I THINK TOMMY. HE WAS DRUNK, TOO." SHE TOOK PICTURES OF DRUNK PEOPLE THE WHOLE SUPER BOWL. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE DID NOT -- SHE DIDN'T HAVE ONE PICTURE OF THE GAME. AND I SAID, "DID YOU WATCH THE GAME?" SHE GOES, "HALFTIME." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY DON'T CARE. DAD HOOKED THEM UP. THEY DON'T CARE.
BUT THEY KNEW THE NAMES OF THE DRUNK FANS.
Jimmy: THEY JUST SOUND LIKE TRADING CARDS. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. "I'LL TRADE YOU A LOUIE FOR A A DOUG. "I ALREADY GOT 30 DOUGS." YOU KNOW WHAT? WE LOVE YOU. AND I WANT TO -- OH, ANY ADVICE TO DENVER OR TO CAROLINA ABOUT THE SUPER BOWL? WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR THE BRONCOS TO WIN?
ARE WE WRAPPING UP HERE?
Jimmy: YEAH, NO, THIS IS IT. WE'RE ALMOST WRAPPING UP.
IS THERE A JETS QUESTION IN HERE?
Jimmy: I ALWAYS TRY TO SNEAK ONE IN THERE, BUT IT'S ALMOST TOO LATE, RIGHT? YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME. YOU JUST ALMOST SHOOK YOUR HEAD "NO."
WELL, NO, I MEAN, I'LL GIVE YOU, LIKE, A -- ARE YOU LEADING UP TO A JETS QUESTION?
Jimmy: WELL, JUST -- [ LAUGHTER ]
JUST TELL ME IF YOU'RE LEADING UP TO A JETS QUESTION. BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GO, "WHAT'S THE ADVICE FOR CAROLINA AND DENVER? AND WHAT ABOUT THE JETS NEXT YEAR." SEE? I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
Jimmy: WHAT ABOUT THE JETS NEXT YEAR? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
COME ON.
Jimmy: THEY'RE GREAT WITH FITZPATRICK, RIGHT? HE WAS GREAT. THE JETS ARE GREAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH." THAT'S THE ATTITUDE, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, LOOK HOW EXCITED YOU ARE. YOUR EYES LIT UP LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING, LIKE -- THE JETS.
NOBODY GIVES A [ BLEEP ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
