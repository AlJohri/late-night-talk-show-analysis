Jimmy: HEY, LOOKING GREAT. YOU LOOK GREAT. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE ALL READY FOR A GREAT SHOW. IT'S GOING TO BE FUN TONIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. TONIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE HIS FINAL STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID IT HAD A MORE OPTIMISTIC TONE. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. INSTEAD OF SEEING THE GLASS HALF EMPTY, OBAMA SEES THE PRESIDENCY AS SEVEN- EIGHTHS OVER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M OUTTA HERE.
Steve: LATES.
Jimmy: TONIGHT WAS PAUL RYAN'S FIRST STATE OF THE UNION AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. BUT GET THIS, DID YOU HEAR THIS, BEN CARSON RECENTLY SAID THAT SEVERAL REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN ACTUALLY TRIED TO RECRUIT HIM FOR THE JOB. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BEN CARSON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, THEY'D HAVE TO CALL HIM WHISPERER OF THE HOUSE. [ MUMBLING ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ MUMBLING ] [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

PEOPLE WERE LIKE, "WHY?" AND TOMMY CHONG IS LIKE, "WHY WHAT, MAN?" [ LAUGHTER ] "WHY ARE YOU SUPPORTING BERNIE?" "BERNIE'S NOT HERE, MAN." [ LAUGHTER ] MARCO RUBIO'S CAMPAIGN SAID THAT IT EXPECTS TO LOSE THE FIRST FOUR STATES IN THE PRIMARY ELECTIONS, BUT HE THINKS THAT HE CAN WIN THE NOMINATION ANYWAY. WHICH IS SORT OF LIKE NOT GETTING A ROSE ON THE BACHELOR AND BEING LIKE, "CALL ME? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] RIGHT, WE HAD SOMETHING, RIGHT? I'LL LEAVE NOW. BYE. BUT CALL ME. CAUSE WE HAD SOMETHING." THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT 1,000 FUND-RAISING COMMITTEES KNOWN AS SUPER PACs CREATED IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE, AND OVER HALF OF THEM WERE MADE BY ONE MAN WHO APPARENTLY JUST DOES IT FOR FUN. PEOPLE ARE LIKE WHO WOULD MESS WITH AN ELECTION JUST FOR FUN. AND TRUMP WAS LIKE, "YOU RANG? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HI, HOW ARE YOU?" THE OTHER BIG NEWS TONIGHT IS THE POWERBALL DRAWING.
