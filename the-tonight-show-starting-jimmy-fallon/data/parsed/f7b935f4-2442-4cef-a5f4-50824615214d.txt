SO, I'M GETTING ALL PUMPED UP, BECAUSE I'VE GOT MY BIG AUDITION COMING UP. IT'S LIKE, ME AND MY COUSINS FOR THE PLAY "LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND SO, BUT THE ONLY PART FOR A GUY WAS THE WOLF. AND SHE GAVE THE PART TO MY COUSIN. AND SO --
Jimmy: NO!
THE FIRST PLAY I EVER AUDITIONED FOR, I LOST OUT TO MY COUSIN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. YOU WERE -- WOLF?
I WAS JUST SO UPSET. LIKE, YOU'RE MY FLESH AND BLOOD.
Jimmy: YEAH. COME ON, MAN.
HOW DO YOU NOT -- AND I PREPARED FOR IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. DID YOU GIVE IT A BAD REVIEW?
I JUST -- I DIDN'T WATCH IT. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY PERFORMED IT AT CHRISTMAS IN FRONT OF, LIKE, THE WHOLE FAMILY. I WAS LIKE, I'M NOT -- I'M NOT WATCHING THAT. SHE DIDN'T SEE MY VISION. BECAUSE THE WOLF DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A WOLF. YOU KNOW? THE WHOLE THING WAS --
Jimmy: YOU WENT REALLY DEEP WITH THE CHARACTER?
OH, IT WAS A WHOLE -- I HAD A WHOLE THING.
Jimmy: BUT THINGS TURNED OUT WELL FOR YOU THOUGH. I MEAN, GOSH, "DIVERGENT" WAS A A GIANT, GIANT MOVIE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: A BIG, BIG, BIG MOVIE. WAS THAT THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU, MAYBE?
THE LAST TIME I CAME ON, I THINK I WAS HERE FOR "THAT AWKWARD MOMENT" WHEN YOU WERE ON --
Jimmy: YEAH.
"THE LATE SHOW," YEAH. THIS IS MY FIRST "TONIGHT SHOW" APPEARANCE, YOU KNOW, EVER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY, COOL, MAN. IT'S EXCITING.
YEAH, IT IS VERY EXCITING.
Jimmy: SINCE YOU'VE BEEN ON, THERE'S A THING CALLED "PETER'S PRINCESSES."
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: NOW THIS IS --
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY HERE TONIGHT.
Jimmy: ARE THERE? [ CHEERS ]
PETER'S PRINCESSES? MAYBE A FEW. I FORGOT TO TELL THEM WHERE I WAS GOING TO BE.
Jimmy: YEAH. NOW WHAT ARE THESE? THESE ARE FANS OF --
NO, IN THE MOVIE, I PLAYED PETER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I THOUGHT MY FANS WOULD HAVE WANTED A NICKNAME, AND I WAS JUST JOKING AROUND. I WAS LIKE, "I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING ALL OF 'PETER'S PRINCESSES' IN PHOENIX TONIGHT." YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE WERE ON A A PRESS TOUR. AND ALL THESE GIRLS HAD SIGNS LIKE, "I'M A PRINCESS. I'M PETER'S PRINCESS." I WAS LIKE, "YES, YOU ARE. YES, YOU ARE."
Jimmy: YOU HAVE YOUR PRINCESSES. THAT'S AWESOME. WE HAVE -- OUR FANS CALLED "FAL PALS."
"FAL PALS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "FAL PALS" IN THE HOUSE. NOW, THIS MOVIE, "WHIPLASH", YOU PLAY A YOUNG DRUMMER IN THE FILM. AND IT HAS TO BE REALLY YOU PLAYING.
OH, YEAH. I MEAN, I STARTED PLAYING WHEN I WAS 15. YOU KNOW, I GOT A DRUM SET, BECAUSE I THOUGHT -- I PLAYED PIANO AND SAXOPHONE, AND THAT WAS COOL. BUT AS I STARTED GETTING OLDER, I WAS LIKE, OH MAN, THE DRUMMER IS THE COOLEST GUY. AS QUEST KNOWS. IT'S JUST LIKE -- YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU JUST HANG IN THE BACK LIKE -- AND DRUMMERS, YOU'RE IN THE POCKET AND YOU'RE PLAYIN' THE BEAT. SO, YEAH, I JUST ASKED FOR A A DRUM KIT.
Jimmy: THERE YOU ARE.
YOU HAVE A PICTURE RIGHT THERE.
Jimmy: THAT'S MILES AT 15. [ AUDIENCE AWs ]
I WAS A YOUNG LOOKING 15. I LOOK LIKE A MEERKAT.
Jimmy: A MEERKAT HOPPING UP BEHIND THAT GIANT DRUM SET.
I GUESS MY DAD, BECAUSE IT COMES IN PIECES. AND SO MY DAD WAS ASSEMBLING IT THE NIGHT BEFORE. THE TOMS ARE ACTUALLY REVERSED AND THE HIGH HAT WAS ALL MESSED UP. BUT MY PARENTS WERE ALWAYS VERY -- MY MOM WANTED ALL OF HER KIDS TO PLAY MUSIC. AND MY HOUSE WAS CONSTANTLY FILLED WITH MUSIC AND KIND OF CONTROLLED CHAOS.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
YEAH, I THINK SHE WANTED A A "PARTRIDGE FAMILY" KIND OF THING.
Jimmy: REALLY?
I'M DEAD SERIOUS. AND MY DAD -- OH YEAH, I FORGOT. MY DAD -- I STARTED PLAYING IN BANDS AND STUFF, AND HE GOES, "YOU KNOW, PLAYED IN A BAND A A LITTLE BIT." I WAS LIKE "DAD, I HAD NO IDEA YOU PLAYED AN INSTRUMENT. WHAT DID YOU PLAY?" HE GOES, "I PLAYED A ROCK TAMBOURINE." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HE WAS LIKE, "NOBODY REALLY WANTED TO BE IN A BAND WITH A A ROCK TAMBOURINE PLAYER."
Jimmy: ROCK TAMBOURINE. YEAH THAT'S --
LIKE WHEN YOU START WITH THAT. YEAH. I MEAN, OH, WHEN YOU'RE GETTING INTO IT --
Jimmy: YOU'VE GOT TO REALLY GET INTO IT. YEAH, YOU'VE GOT TO REALLY GO FOR IT. ROCK TAMBOURINE TIME, YEAH. [ CHEERS ] WHAT WAS THE NAME OF HIS BAND? [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH!
Jimmy: SHOW HIM WHAT'S UP, FRANK. FRANK, GIVE HIM A LITTLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S ROCK TAMBOURINE. I WATCHED THIS FILM AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I SAID, "WELL THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S A STUNT DOUBLE." YOU WERE REALLY PLAYING. DID YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE?
YEAH, I MEAN, I PLAYED DRUMS, YOU KNOW, FOR MANY YEARS. I PLAYED KIND OF -- I SAY, LIKE, FLORIDA ROCK 'N ROLL.
Jimmy: LYNYRD SKYNYRD?
LITERALLY, WE WERE COVERING, LIKE, CREED AT SOME POINT, AND --
Jimmy: YEAH!
PUDDLE OF MUDD.
Jimmy: WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN!
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU DO EDDIE VEDDER MUFFIN MAN?
Jimmy: YEAH.
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT THE OTHER DAY.
Jimmy: I GOT IT.
IT WAS SO FUNNY.
Jimmy: STOP. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, SORRY. YOU WERE SAYING --
I PLAYED. BUT I NEVER PLAYED CREED.
Jimmy: DID YOU TEACH YOURSELF?
YEAH, I JUST KIND OF PICKED IT UP. EVERY OTHER INSTRUMENT, I GOT LESSONS. LIKE, PIANO I GOT LESSONS, AND SAXOPHONE I GOT LESSONS. BUT DRUMS, I FELT LIKE I KIND OF HAD A NATURAL KNACK FOR I, AND I PICKED IT UP PRETTY QUICK. BUT JAZZ DRUMMING IS ITS OWN ANIMAL. I ALWAYS FELT LIKE I WAS COMING IN -- YOU'RE COMING IN EARLY JUST BECAUSE THE TIMING OF EVERYTHING. AND THESE JAZZ DRUMMERS THAT I WAS WATCHING, LIKE JOE JONES AND BUDDY RICH, IT'S JUST A A LEVEL OF PERCUSSION SKILL. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY KIND OF VIRTUOSO.
Jimmy: DO YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT DIFFERENTLY?
THAT WAS THE THING, THE FUNDAMENTAL THING OF HOLDING A A STICK IS DIFFERENTLY. SO, INSTEAD OF KIND OF THIS MORE VERTICAL HITTING WITH IT, IT'S MORE OF A FLICK. YOU'RE MOVING AROUND THE KIT AND A IT'S JUST WHOLE DIFFERENT -- IT'S A DIFFERENT THING. AND I FELT VERY, YOU KNOW, BAD AT IT. BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE, YOU KNOW, THROUGH HOURS OF PRACTICE, I KIND OF GOT TO A POINT WHERE I FELT PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT. JAZZ IS LIKE --
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. YOU DON'T MESS WITH THAT STUFF.
YEAH, IT'S ALL HARD.
Jimmy: I WAS MESMERIZED THE WHOLE FILM. I LOVED IT SO MUCH. BASICALLY, YOU'RE A STUDENT IN A MUSIC SCHOOL.
YES.
Jimmy: AND J.K. SIMMONS, WOW. I MEAN, YOU GUYS TOGETHER --
HE TEARS IT UP.
Jimmy: HE'S A TEACHER THAT BASICALLY IS VERY INTENSE. TO SAY THE LEAST.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND HE GETS RIGHT IN YOUR FACE AND CURSES YOU OUT. AND, LIKE, WANTS YOU TO PLAY FASTER. THEN HE THROW THINGS AT YOU.
YEAH. HIS FACE WAS RIGHT HERE. FOR LIKE -- IN MY FACE, HE YELLED AT ME FOR THE WHOLE MONTH. BUT HE'S FANTASTIC IN IT.
Jimmy: HE PUSHES YOU, BECAUSE HE WANTS YOU TO BE THE BEST. AND WHATEVER HE HAS TO DO TO PUSH HIS STUDENTS -- LIKE, HE THROWS PEOPLE OUT OF THE CLASS. I'VE NEVER SEEN --
PEOPLE ARE KIND OF CALLING IT LIKE "FULL METAL JACKET" AT JULLIARD. IT'S USUALLY A CHARACTER --
Jimmy: IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT, YEAH.
NOT SO FUNNY THOUGH, PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET.
KIND OF -- ON THE EDGE THERE.
Jimmy: BUT YOU'RE PLAYING, AND HE'S YELLING AT YOU, AND TALKING ABOUT YOUR MOTHER AND HE'S DOING WHATEVER. AND YOU'RE CRYING AND THERE'S BLOOD, AND YOU'RE BLEEDING. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S ALL TRUE.
Jimmy: THAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING?
NO, BUT I'M SAYING -- HE WAS TALKING ABOUT MY MOM. I THINK AT ANY GIVEN POINT, I'M LIKE, BLEEDING OR CRYING OR COVERED IN SWEAT. IT'S KIND OF A LOST PRACTICE, I THINK. I THINK PEOPLE HAVE KIND OF -- THEY WANT THAT INSTANT GRATIFICATION, OR THEY WANT THAT GOOD JOB. AND WE'VE KIND OF DEVELOPED A A SYSTEM WHERE YOU GET A TROPHY FOR EVERYTHING. AND HE'S OLD SCHOOL TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S LIKE -- NO, YOU SHOULD STRIVE TO BE THE BEST AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH COMPETITION. AND THAT "GOOD JOB," HE SAYS, ARE ACTUALLY THE TWO MOST HARMFUL WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. AND THAT YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO PUSH YOU TO REALLY ACHIEVE GREATNESS. YOU HAVE TO KIND OF SACRIFICE A A LOT.
Jimmy: THE MOVIE IS CALLED "WHIPLASH." IT'S PHENOMENAL. YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT. THIS IS A SCENE WHERE YOU'RE PRACTICING LATE NIGHT, AFTER HOURS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND HE HEARS YOU DRUMMING.
OH, YEAH.
