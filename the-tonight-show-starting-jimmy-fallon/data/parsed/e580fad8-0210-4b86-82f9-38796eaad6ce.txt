Jimmy: YOU DID AND YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU. YOU LOOK GOOD TOO. YOU ALSO LOOK LESS FAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT HE'S BASICALLY SAYING TO ME.
Jimmy: NO, BUT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BROUGHT IT UP.
BASICALLY.
Jimmy: NO, YOU BROUGHT IT UP. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
NO, I ALWAYS LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU, AND THEY'RE LIKE, "HEY, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? YEAH, YOU LOOK GOOD." THAT'S -- YOU'RE IMPLICATING THAT I ONCE LOOKED BAD AND I DON'T APPRECIATE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YEAH, I'VE REALLY BEEN WORKING ON MYSELF WITH THE HELP OF CAMERON DIAZ'S NEW BOOK. IT'S IN STORES SOON.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU HAVE FUN WITH IT. HELPS US ALL DRINK WATER.
YES.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE GOT TO SAY CONGRATS ON "FROZEN." OH, MY GOSH, GREAT MOVIE.
OH, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AND WHAT A FUN MOVIE.
I HEARD YOU SINGING "DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?" IT WAS REALLY -- ♪ DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN ♪
Jimmy: OH. OH, IT MAKES -- I CRY.
I SMELL A SEQUEL. NOW, THERE'S TWO OLAFS.
Jimmy: I'M LIKE, WAIT, WHAT?
YEAH. I THINK DISNEY -- YEAH, IT'S REALLY GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: UM, NO. BUT DO PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU -- DO THEY RECOGNIZE YOU? DO THEY KNOW THAT IT'S YOU IN THERE?
OH, ALL OF THE TIME. SO, I THINK THAT THE WEIRD THING IS, IS I WAS AT THE AIRPORT YESTERDAY. AND I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH, YOU KNOW, THE IDEA THAT EVERYBODY HAS INSTANT SOCIAL MEDIA NOW, AND THEY CAN LOOK UP WHO PLAYS WHICH CHARACTER. I WOULD NEVER KNOW IF I SAW SEBASTIAN WALKING ON THE STREET. I'D NEVER BE LIKE, "OH, THAT -- THAT JAMAICA MAN IS THE CRAB." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ♪ UNDER THE SEA ♪
♪ UNDER DA SEA DOWN WHERE IT'S WETTER ♪
Jimmy: YEAH, I LOVE IT.
UH -- SO, I'M NOT HERE TO PROMOTE THAT MOVIE, JIMMY. SO, ANYWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I'M AT THE AIRPORT.
Jimmy: YOU SIDETRACKED.
HAVE YOU SEEN IT, THOUGH?
Jimmy: IT'S REALLY GOOD.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
Jimmy: "LITTLE MERMAID," YOU GUYS. GET IT ON BLU-RAY. DVD! [ LAUGHTER ]
COME ON!
Jimmy: YOU GOTTA GO GET 'EM, DUDE.
Steve: DVD.
SO, I'M -- I'M AT THE AIRPORT YESTERDAY TRYING TO CATCH -- OR TWO DAYS AGO, AT THIS LITTLE TEENY AIRPORT. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN TO PORTER AIRPORT IN TORONTO? IT'S A -- NO, NOBODY HAS. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY, SO IT'S THIS LITTLE AIRPORT IN TORONTO. AND THEY BASICALLY FLY, LIKE -- I CALL THEM "LA BAMBA" PLANES BECAUSE THEY'RE THE PLANES THAT, LIKE, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ON. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO, LIKE, THEY'RE --
Jimmy: OH, NO.
OH, I'M SORRY. TOO SOON? TOO SOON?
Jimmy: NO, NOT TOO SOON. JUST NO.
NO? OKAY.
Jimmy: NO.
NO, IT'S NOT SOON ENOUGH.
Jimmy: I THINK YOU STARTED SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
JOSH GAD, BANNED FROM "TONIGHT SHOW" FOR DATED "LA BAMBA" JOKE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I'M -- I'M, YOU KNOW, READY TO GET ON THIS PLANE AND THE PILOT, YOU KNOW -- WE'RE LIKE LITERALLY TAKING OFF, AND HE GOES, "FOLKS, WE'VE GOT A A PROBLEM. WE'RE GOING TO TURN BACK AROUND." AND I'M LIKE, OH, GOD -- THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD IMPRESSION OF A PILOT.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT WAS GOOD.
YEAH. SO, WE GO BACK, WE TURN BACK AROUND, AND I GET INTO THE AIRPORT AND, LIKE, THERE ARE NO PLANES TAKING OFF. THEY'RE SHUTTING DOWN THE AIRPORT. THEY'RE LIKE -- THE AIRPORT HAS A CURFEW. I'M LIKE, YOU PUT THE AIRPORT TO SLEEP AT NIGHT? WHAT HAPPENS?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, HAS A A CURFEW.
SO, AS I'M LIKE REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I'M GOING TO GET TO NEW YORK TO DO ALL MY PRESS, THIS WOMAN COMES UP TO ME. SHE GOES, "HEY, HEY YOU, COME OVER HERE." SHE WAS AUSTRALIAN, CLEARLY. "HEY, YOU -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU COME OVER HERE." AND I'M, SHE'S VERY DEMANDING. AND I'M LIKE, "YES?" SHE'S LIKE, "I KNOW YOU, YOU'RE OLAF. HEY, HEY, HEY! EDDIE, COME HERE!" THIS LITTLE KID MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE 5 YEARS OLD IS LOOKING AT ME LIKE THIS. AND SHE GOES, "I WANT YOU TO TAKE A PICTURE, EDDIE, WITH OLAF." AND THE KID'S LIKE, "THAT'S -- THAT IS A 30-YEAR-OLD MAN." [ LAUGHTER ] "THAT IS NOT -- THAT'S NOT OLAF."
Jimmy: I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW VOICEOVERS WORK.
NO, AND SHE -- SHE FORCED ME TO TAKE A PICTURE WITH HIM. AND I SWEAR HE LOOKS AT HER AFTER IT'S DONE. AND THIS IS HOW HE POSED FOR THE PICTURE -- [ LAUGHTER ] THEN LOOKS -- LOOKS AT HER AFTER WE'RE DONE AND GOES, "CAN WE GO NOW, MOM?" [ LAUGHTER ] SO UPSETTING.
Jimmy: AND YOU HAVE A A 2-YEAR-OLD, RIGHT?
I HAVE A 3 1/2-YEAR-OLD AND I HAVE A BABY, A 4-MONTH-OLD. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU SO MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: DO THEY WATCH "FROZEN" LIKE EVERY OTHER CHILD IN THE WORLD?
WELL, THE 4-MONTH-OLD DOESN'T WATCH "FROZEN." WHAT KIND OF PARENTING ARE YOU DOING, JIMMY? [ LAUGHTER ] THE 3 1/2 --
Jimmy: MY BABY WATCHES, JUST WATCHED "APOCALYPSE NOW" THIS MORNING. LOVED IT.
WE DO "CLOCKWORK ORANGE" WITH MY KIDS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, THE 3 1/2-YEAR-OLD WATCHES IT RELIGIOUSLY, BUT SHE DOESN'T CARE MUCH FOR OLAF. IT'S LIKE HER LEAST, THE CHARACTER THAT SHE'S LEAST INTERESTED IN. SHE, LIKE, WANTS TO USE ME TO GET TO THE GIRLS. SHE'S LIKE, "DAD, WHERE ARE THEY? WHERE -- I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THEM BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT THEM IN THE MOVIE ALL OF THE TIME." I DON'T KNOW WHY MY DAUGHTER SOUNDS SO SOPHISTICATED.
Jimmy: YEAH, VERY NICE.
BUT SHE ASKED ABOUT THEM. SO, ONE DAY AFTER WE HAD HAD OUR LITTLE BABY, SHE WAS KIND OF GETTING TO THAT PLACE WHERE IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, SHE DOESN'T QUITE KNOW HOW THE BABY FITS IN AND SHE'S BEEN, LIKE, REALLY TRYING TO BE ELSA. LIKE, SHE HAS ALL THESE QUALITIES THAT SHE'S TRYING TO BE LIKE ELSA. SO, I GO IN THE ROOM TO TALK TO HER, AND I'M LIKE, "AVA, ARE YOU OKAY? YOU'RE A LITTLE DOWN." AND SHE'S LIKE FACING -- LIKE SILHOUETTED BY DARKNESS AND SHE TURNS AROUND AND SHE LOOKS AT ME AND SHE GOES, "JUST LEAVE. MY POWERS ARE TOO STRONG." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I COULD NOT -- I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. I SAID TO MY WIFE, I GO, "WE EITHER NEED TO LET HER STOP WATCHING "FROZEN" OR GET AN EXORCIST IMMEDIATELY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE IN A NEW MOVIE, "WISH I WAS HERE." THIS IS, UH -- ZACH BRAFF.
MM-HMM.
Jimmy: DIRECTED THIS.
ZACH BRAFF, WHO DID "GARDEN STATE."
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. GREAT, GREAT CAST.
GREAT CAST. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT IS THIS FILM ABOUT?
THE FILM IS ABOUT -- BASICALLY, IT'S KIND OF LIKE A A SPIRITUAL RELATIVE OF "GARDEN STATE" IN MANY WAYS. IT'S ABOUT A FAMILY COMING TO TERMS WITH THIS -- INEVITABLE LOSS OF THE PATRIARCH OF THE FAMILY, OR THE PATRIARCH WHO'S VERY ILL, PLAYED BY, BRILLIANTLY BY MANDY PATINKIN. AND MY CHARACTER IS KIND OF LIKE A SHELTERED, SHUT-IN, BRILLIANT GUY, WHO DOESN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING WITH HIMSELF. HE DOESN'T REALLY APPLY HIMSELF, AND IT'S ABOUT THEM ALL COMING TO TERMS WITH THEIR PLACE IN THE FAMILY.
Jimmy: PRETTY COOL. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S JOSH GAD IN "WISH I WAS HERE." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. >
YOU CAN'T JUST SHOW THE KIDS VIDEOS, AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T FORCE THEM INTO LEARNING.
WELL, THEN WHAT'S YOUR IDEA? BECAUSE THEY'RE FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE THING I TRY.
WE NEED TO REGROUP. WHY DON'T WE GO TO DINNER?
WHO IS GOING TO BABYSIT?
"LEGO DEATHSTAR" IS WORTH THREE HOURS OF BABYSITTING IF AND ONLY IF IT'S IN THE BOX AND SAID BOX IS IN MINT CONDITION.
IT IS. IT'S BRAND-NEW.
CAN I KEEP HIM TAPED UP LIKE THAT?
NO. NO.
I'LL FREE HIM. YOU'VE GOT THREE HOURS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU MEAN BUSINESS.
YEAH. I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL -- I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL ANYTHING, BUT I DO -- I KILL THE CHILDREN.
