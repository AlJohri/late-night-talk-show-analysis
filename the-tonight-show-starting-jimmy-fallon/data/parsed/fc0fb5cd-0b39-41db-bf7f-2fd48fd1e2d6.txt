Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- EDDIE REDMAYNE -- LILY COLLINS -- MUSICAL GUEST, MARTHA WAINWRIGHT -- AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 567, TOLEDO! YEAH!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HI! WELCOME! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. WELCOME. THIS IS IT! YOU MADE IT! YOU'RE HERE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE -- [ LAUGHTER ] THE BIG STORY IS THAT AMERICA WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND WAS LIKE --
Steve: DID I DO THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT. REPUBLICANS HOPE HE'LL KEEP HIS PROMISE TO BUILD A WALL, AND DEMOCRATS HOPE HE'LL KEEP HIS PROMISE NOT TO ACCEPT THE ELECTION RESULTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT. YOU SAID YOU'D" -- AFTER THE RESULTS CAME IN, DONALD TRUMP GAVE A BIG VICTORY SPEECH. YEP. HE SAID HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE, HIS ROCK, HIS BETTER HALF, FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLED DONALD TRUMP LAST NIGHT TO CONGRATULATE HIM, EVEN INVITED HIM TO THE HOUSE FOR A MEETING TOMORROW. OF COURSE, IT WAS HARD TO UNDERSTAND OBAMA BECAUSE AT THE TIME, HE WAS EATING 80 PIECES OF NICORETTE. HE WAS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "YEAH, OH, JUST COME BY. I'M, UH, REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT." AND THIS PROBABLY DIDN'T SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT TRUMP ALSO RECEIVED CONGRATULATIONS FROM RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. [ AUDIENCE BOO'S ] HE SPENT TWO MINUTES ON THE PHONE DISCUSSING POLITICS, THEN AN HOUR SAYING, "NO, YOU HANG UP." [ RUSSIAN ACCENT ] "NO, YOU HANG UP." [ TRUMP VOICE ] "NO, YOU HANG UP." [ RUSSIAN ACCENT ] "NO, YOU HANG UP." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "NO, YOU." [ APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, THIS MEANS THAT EARLY NEXT YEAR, TRUMP WILL BE MOVING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND HE WILL BECOME THE FIRST PRESIDENT WHO MOVES IN AND HANGS UP HIS OWN PORTRAIT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I'LL PUT THIS RIGHT HERE." [ LAUGHTER ] ANOTHER BIG STORY TO COME OUT LAST NIGHT WAS HOW BAD THE POLLING WAS BUT THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN THE POLLING INDUSTRY SAID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY DID WRONG, THEN PRESENT THEIR FINDINGS AT THE CLEVELAND BROWNS SUPER BOWL PARADE. [ APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, I READ THAT THE POLLS MAY HAVE BEEN OFF BECAUSE THE SHIFT OF CELL PHONES MADE IT HARDER TO COLLECT DATA FROM PEOPLE. AND HILLARY SAID, "THEY SEEMED TO HAVE A PRETTY EASY TIME COLLECTING DATA FROM MY PHONE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: EY-YO! HO!
Jimmy: AND DID YOU SEE THE CAKE THEY HAD AT TRUMP'S ELECTION NIGHT PARTY? IT WAS TERRIFYING. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THING. THIS IS REAL. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT?
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT. FIRST, DONALD TRUMP SAID, "TONIGHT ISN'T ABOUT CAKE, AND ALSO THAT THING DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE ME." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN REINCE PRIEBUS SAID, "WE HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT." FINALLY, CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID, "WHERE EXACTLY IS THE CAKE RIGHT NOW?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. GUYS, I KNOW TODAY HAS BEEN A A CRAZY DAY. SOME PEOPLE ARE SAD. SOME PEOPLE ARE SCARED AND NERVOUS. SOME PEOPLE ARE HAPPY. I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE JUST EXHAUSTED. BUT AS PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID, "NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, THE SUN WILL RISE IN THE MORNING." AND THIS MORNING I WAS WALKING AROUND NEW YORK CITY, AND THIS GUY CAME UP TO ME, AND HE SAID, "HEY, WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOME LAUGHS TONIGHT." AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO. MY JOB IS TO COME OUT HERE EVERY NIGHT AND TRY TO MAKE YOU LAUGH AND TAKE YOUR MIND OFF THINGS FOR A WHILE. SO, I HOPE THAT NO MATTER HOW YOU'RE FEELING, YOU CAN TURN ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW," AND WE'LL BE HERE TO SPREAD SOME JOY AND PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE. THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO DO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'LL BE HERE FOR YOU IF YOU NEED US. AND, I'M SO THANKFUL YOU'RE THERE FOR US, TOO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR IT.

SO, WE DO THIS THING EVERY WEDNESDAY WHERE I SEND OUT A A HASHTAG, AND WE ASK YOU GUYS TO TWEET OUT THINGS BASED ON A A TOPIC THAT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS. SO, SINCE PEOPLE VOTED TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA IN CALIFORNIA, MASSACHUSETTS, AND NEVADA YESTERDAY, I WENT ON TWITTER AND SENT OUT A HASHTAG CALLED "NEW WEED LAWS." [ LAUGHTER ] SO, FOR EXAMPLE, I THINK A GOOD NEW WEED LAW WOULD BE THAT WHITE CASTLES WILL HAVE TO LEGALLY STAY OPEN 24 HOURS -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND ALLOW PET IGUANAS ON THE PREMISES.
Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, WE WANT TO HEAR SOME OF YOUR IDEAS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TWEET ONE USING THE #NEWWEEDLAWS. OR YOU CAN POST THEM ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE AS WELL. JUST KEEP IT SHORT-ISH.
Steve: YEAH.

YOU KNOW WHAT? FOR ME, WHAT I KIND OF LOVED ABOUT THIS FILM IS, YOU KNOW IT BEING A J.K. ROWLING FILM AND GOING BACK TO THAT KIND OF POTTER-VERSE, THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A SCALE TO IT. BUT ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED FROM JO, AND THE DIRECTOR AND PRODUCER, THEY WORKED ON THOSE FILMS. AND SO THEY'RE SO CALM AND CONFIDENT THAT THEY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAKING AN INDIE MOVIE. SO THEY KIND OF GIVE YOU THAT. AND IT TAKES GREAT POWER TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT YOU'RE -- DESPITE THE SCALE OF THE SET, IT FELT KIND OF SMALL AND INTIMATE, WHICH IS GREAT.
Jimmy: NO WAY THAT FELT SMALL.
REALLY? IT TECHNICALLY DID.
Jimmy: I MEAN, IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. I MEAN, I LOOK AT IT AND GO, THIS IS SO EXPENSIVE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WOW!
Jimmy: I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING -- I MEAN, WHAT IS REAL, BESIDES YOU? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WELL, I HAVE LIKE A PRETTY AWFUL IMAGINATION. SO FORTUNATELY, I THOUGHT A LOT OF IT WAS GOING TO BE CGI THINGS. AND SOME MAKE BELIEVEY THINGS.
Jimmy: OH RIGHT.
AND QUITE A LOT OF IT WAS BUILT. WHEN WE GOT THE SCRIPT, IT WAS SET IN NEW YORK IN THE 1920's. AND MY WIFE AND I WERE SO EXCITED. WE GOT TO COME HERE, YOU KNOW. AND THEY WERE LIKE, IT'S SHOOTING IN WATFORD, JUST OUTSIDE OF LONDON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT THEY BUILT A PRETTY PHENOMENAL VERSION OF 1920'S --
Jimmy: WELL, WE LIVE HERE. YEAH.
LET YOU GUYS HERE, YEAH.
Jimmy: REALLY DID A GREAT JOB. I'M LIKE, THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN FILM THIS NOW, BECAUSE YOU GOT TO SHUT THINGS DOWN THESE STREETS LIKE THAT DON'T EXIST. COBBLESTONE -- IT'S THE 1920's.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BEAUTIFUL COSTUMES AND EVERYTHING. BUT THEN THERE ARE ALL THESE FANTASTIC BEASTS --
YEAH.
Jimmy: -- THAT ARE JUST INSANE. AND HONESTLY, FRIGHTENING.
YEAH.
Jimmy: SOME OF THEM ARE, YOU KNOW, COMPLETELY. I WAS LIKE, OH -- OH, THAT'S NOT REAL. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, BUT I DON'T EVEN -- I WOULDN'T, THAT'S WHY I'M NOT IN THE MOVIES. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT I CAN SEE.
Jimmy: I AUDITION. I AUDITION.
I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY CONVINCING.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD! [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S SO SCARY. BUT I REALLY WAS LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD ACT TO THOSE THINGS WHEN THEY'RE NOT THERE.
WELL, THEY HAD ALL THESE SORT OF WEIRD AND WONDERFUL TECHNIQUES THAT SOMETIMES YOU WERE -- YOU WERE LIKE ACTING WITH GIGANTIC PUPPETS. LIKE FROM THE GUYS WHO WORKED ON "WAR HORSE." LIKE, CREATED THESE HUGE PUPPETS. AND THEN SOMETIMES YOU WERE JUST TALKING TO -- LIKE YOUR IMAGINARY FRIEND ON YOUR HAND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, LIKE WHEN YOU'RE PETTING THEM. THE GIANT BIRD.
GIANT BIRD. THAT ONE'S GOOD.
Jimmy: THAT ONE'S GOOD?
THAT WAS SO CONVINCING.
Jimmy: SEE? I CAN BE IN THE SEQUEL, IF THERE'S A SEQUEL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AWFUL. YOU'RE JUST MAKING ME FEEL GOOD. BUT I MEAN -- I THOUGHT, WHAT A A MIND THAT J.K. ROWLING HAS. AND HOW CREATIVE IS THAT HUMAN BEING.
IT'S PRETTY FORMIDABLE.
Jimmy: AND IT'S ROWLING, NOT ROWLING.
ROWLING, YES. J.K. ROWLING.
Jimmy: ROWLING, THAT'S RIGHT.
AND I --
Jimmy: SHE'S COME TO THE SET?
SHE DID COME TO THE SET. AND I HAD THIS SORT OF -- I BASICALLY SUFFER FROM THIS LIKE VERBAL DIARRHEA THING, THAT IF I GET NERVOUS, I JUST TALK. AND IT HAPPENED WHEN I MET STEPHEN HAWKING. AND IT WAS REALLY EMBARRASSING, BECAUSE IT TAKES A WHILE FOR HIM TO SPEAK. AND SO I JUST TALKED AT HIM FOR 25 MINUTES. [ LAUGHTER ] THE SAME THING HAPPENED. THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH J.K. ROWLING. WE MET. AND WE ONLY HAD AN HOUR BEFORE WE STARTED FILMING. AND I HAD TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT NEWT. AND I FOUND MYSELF OFF LIKE 25 MINUTES. AND I WAS LIKE, AND MY INNER VOICE WAS GOING, SHUT UP. STOP TALKING. [ LAUGHTER ] LET THE WOMAN SPEAK.
Jimmy: YES, SHE'S REAL GOOD AT IT.
BUT SHE'S EXTRAORDINARY. YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT SHE'S CREATIVE. EVERYTHING -- I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOVE IT. I MEAN, IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK, YOU SHOULD GO SEE IT AND CHECK IT OUT IN IMAX AND JUST WOULD BE AMAZING TO SEE IT IN IMAX. BUT, YOU GET IN THE SUITCASE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD. IT'S JUST -- EVERYTHING IS SO CREATIVE AND COOL. DAN FOGLER?
DAN FOGLER, WE LOVE DAN FOGLER.
Jimmy: HE'S SO FUNNY, MAN. I LOVE HIM. HE'S DOING WELL?
HE'S DOING EXTRAORDINARILY WELL. SO DAN PLAYS A MUGGLE IN THE FILM. SO HE'S KIND OF THE ONLY NON-WIZARD.
Jimmy: NOMAG.
A NOMAG. AMERICAN TERM. GOOD TERMINOLOGY KNOWLEDGE.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. YEAH, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
AND I LOVE DAN.
Jimmy: I READ THE FIRST TWO HARRY POTTERS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO I KNOW. NO, I'M JUST KITING. I READ ALL OF THEM. COME ON, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
BUT DAN IS LIKE A, YOU KNOW, HE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY STAGE ACTOR AND COMEDIAN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND WE HAD THIS HILARIOUS THING WHERE WE TRIED COME OFF PLAYING THESE QUITE SERIOUS PARTS AND TRYING TO GET LIKE REALLY METHOD ON IT. AND I'M PLAYING NEWT SCAMANDER WHO IS A ZOOOLOGIST. I WAS LIKE -- I SAID TO THE DIRECTOR, I NEED TO GO MEET CREATURES AND PEOPLE THAT HANDLE CREATURES AND SPEND LOTS OF TIME WITH ANIMALS. AND OCCASIONALLY ON SET, I'D BE GOING, DAVID, WOULD YOU JUST TELL ME AGAIN, LIKE SPECIFICALLY WHAT SORT OF BREED OF HIPPOGRIFF? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, WHAT SORT OF -- AND LIKE, AND DAN WAS DOING NONE OF THAT, BUT WAS ACTING SO MUCH BETTER THAN I WAS. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS LIKE, DUDE, IT'S A A FRICKIN' BIG DRAGON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S A FRICKIN' BIG DRAGON, OKAY? JEEZ.
CALM DOWN.
Jimmy: BUT YOU -- YOU HAD TO DO THIS CRAZY, NOT A SPOILER, BUT LIKE A MATING DANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, TO LURE -- [ CHEERS ] THIS IS WHY YOU'RE GREAT. I DON'T KNOW. I COULDN'T HAVE -- HOW DID YOU COME TO LEARN THOSE EXACT MOVES? DID YOU -- IS THAT RESEARCH --
I TRY TO WORK OUT. JUDGMENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT WAS THE RESEARCH BEHIND -- NO, NO. LIKE WHAT WAS THAT? THE DIRECTOR JUST SAYING, EDDIE, DO THIS? NO?
NO, IT WAS JUST A MATING MOMENT IN THE SCRIPT IN WHICH -- SO ONE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT J.K. ROWLING'S SCRIPTS IS THE DIALOGUE IS NOT ONLY -- BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST TIME SHE'S WRITTEN THE SCRIPT HERSELF. AND THE DIALOGUE IS NOT ONLY WONDERFUL, BUT ALL THE DESCRIPTION IN BETWEEN IS KIND OF SO INTRICATE AND DETAILED. AND THERE WAS THIS SCENE WHICH IT JUST GOES, AND NEWT PERFORMS MATING DANCE. AND I WAS JUST READING, GOT A A NEWT PERFORMANCE MATING DANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] TWO WORDS THAT NEVER FILLED ME WITH SO MUCH --
Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANT TO GOOGLE THAT EITHER.
YOU KNOW WHAT.
Jimmy: NO, YEAH, TRUST ME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GET FIRED.
BUT I DID, OF COURSE. I WENT AND LOOKED ON LIKE WEIRD RANDOM BIRD MATING CALLS. AND I MADE A FEW VIDEOS THAT I WOULD SEND TO THE DIRECTOR. THEY WERE THE MOST HUMILIATING THINGS YOU'VE SEEN IN YOUR LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'D WAIT THE MOST PAINFUL LIKE FIVE HOURS AND HE WOULD RESPOND GOING, "IF I'M GOING TO BE SEDUCING THIS HUGE ROMPANT, WHICH IS A KIND OF RHINO MEETS ELEPHANT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
ON HEAT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD RESPOND AFTER THREE HOURS GOING, I'M NOT SURE IT'S QUITE SEDUCTIVE ENOUGH, YOU KNOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND SO -- YEAH, BASICALLY IT WAS REALLY HUMILIATING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I CAN TEACH IT TO YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO, NO. I DON'T WANT TO STEAL -- I WOULDN'T STEAL YOUR THUNDER.
I LOVE THE MOOD. LOVE THE MOOD.
Jimmy: WHAT CAN I DO? WHAT DO I DO? [ CHEERS ] [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

THAT'S ALL I KEPT HEARING ABOUT IS THIS POP COLLAR. LIKE HE HAD -- LIKE A POLO POP --
Jimmy: HE JUST LOOKED COOL.
YEAH. LIKE --
Jimmy: YEAH, LIKE HE JUST ROCKED IT ALL. LOVE IT.
AND LIKE HE DIDN'T FEEL THE NEED TO DRESS UP. BUT POPPING THE COLLAR CHANGED EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: OH IT WAS THE BEST. EVERYONE WAS BLOGGING ABOUT IT, TALKING ABOUT IT.
I'M SURPRISED IT WASN'T AN ABERCROMBIE SHIRT, THOUGH. BECAUSE MY DAD AND I, FUN FACT, USED TO SHOP AT ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH TOGETHER.
Jimmy: I USE TO WORK THERE.
DID YOU SPRAY THE PERFUME?
Jimmy: I WAS THE -- I WAS THE SHIRTLESS MODEL. HELLO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, YOU WERE MY DAD'S INSPIRATION. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU WERE HIS INSPIRATION. NO BUT WE USED TO GO -- HE USED TO WEAR A UNIFORM. YOU KNOW, LIKE GUYS IF THEY LIKE A SHIRT, THEY'LL BUY IT LIKE IN THE SAME COLOR OR TEN VERSIONS OF IT --
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
SO MY DAD -- I LOVED ABERCROMBIE, SO HE STARTED WEARING CARGO PANTS AND LIKE THE POLO SHIRTS. SO I WAS SURPRISED THAT IT WASN'T AN ABERCROMBIE. TIMES ARE CHANGING.
Jimmy: ARE THOSE STORES I GOT THAT IN THIS BOOK HERE? "UNFILTERED." CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS.
THANK YOU. NO, THIS IS MY NEW BOOK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: STORIES OR --
NO, IT'S A -- IT'S A A COLLECTION OF ESSAYS AND LETTERS TO PEOPLE AND TO MYSELF ABOUT WHAT IT IS TO BECOME A A YOUNG WOMAN. AND I DISCUSS LOTS OF TABOO THINGS THAT GIRLS DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT, BUT THE SECOND THAT WE DO, WE REALIZE WE'RE NOT ALONE AND WE'RE NOT CRAZY. SO, IT'S FUNNY STORIES AT TIME. IT'S REALLY DARK. IT'S KIND OF -- I'M ONLY 27, I'M NOT SAYING I KNOW EVERYTHING, BUT THESE ARE THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED UP UNTIL NOW.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT. GOOD FOR YOU.
YEAH, THANKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SO, TELL YOU ABOUT THIS MOVIE, "RULES DON'T APPLY," WARREN BEATTY, I MEAN, HOWARD HUGHES. I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
I WAS HEARING ABOUT THAT MANY YEARS AGO. I MEAN, WE BOTH WERE JUST -- IT WAS IN THE AURA. EVERYONE KNEW ABOUT THIS MOVIE. HE WAS TELLING ME STORIES ABOUT WHAT HE HEARD. I WAS LIKE -- THAT'S CRAZY. THAT WOULD BE A DREAM. PEOPLE GOING TO HIS HOUSE FOR EIGHT OR NINE HOURS FOR MEETINGS. AND YOU THINK, WHAT IS THAT?
Jimmy: AND THEN YOU ENDED UP IN THE ZONE --
AND I ENDED UP DOING IT. IT WAS SO STRANGE.
Jimmy: HOW IS WARREN BEATTY? HE'S A PRETTY INTIMIDATING GUY WHEN YOU MEET HIM.
YEAH. BUT THEN, HE'S -- HE'S GOING TO BE ON HERE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS, RIGHT?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH, SO YOU'LL BE INTIMIDATED.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I ALWAYS AM WITH MY GUESTS.
NO, BUT HE'S SO WARM. I MEAN, THE WAY THAT IT ALL HAPPENED IS I WAS IN HAIR AND MAKEUP AT MY APARTMENT GETTING READY FOR A PREMIERE FOR "MORTAL INSTRUMENTS." AND MY AGENT CALLED ME AND SAID WARREN BEATTY WANTS YOU TO CALL HIM AT HOME RIGHT NOW. AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU TALK -- LIKE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HE GAVE ME A PHONE NUMBER AND I CALLED IT. AND WARREN BEATTY PICKS UP THE PHONE, AND SAID, I TOLD YOU TO NEVER TO CALL MY HOUSE. I WAS LIKE -- THOUGHT IT WAS A A JOKE. I COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS WAS. AND HE GOES, I'M JUST KIDDING, LILY. WHAT'S GOING ON?
Jimmy: OHH MY GOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
I WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOD! WHAT IS THIS? AND SO HE'S LIKE I HAVE TO --
Jimmy: I WOULD HAVE FREAKED OUT.
I FREAKED OUT. HE'S LIKE, I HAVE TO MEET WITH YOU. AND I SAID WELL, I'M SORRY, I DON'T HAVE LIKE SIX HOURS. I HAVE -- I'M LEAVING FOR A A PRESS TOUR, I HAVE LIKE 20 MINUTES TOMORROW. SO WE ENDED UP  -- WE ENDED UP MEETING IN THE SAME BACKYARD I MET EDDIE IN. WARREN CAME TO MY MOM'S HOUSE. AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS NEUTRAL TERRITORY, IT WAS VERY CLOSE BY. AND MY MOM, OF COURSE, FREAKED OUT. SHE SAID, WE CAN'T HAVE HIM HERE, THE HOUSE IS A MESS. WHERE IS HE GOING TO SIT? WHAT'S HE GOING TO EAT? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DRINK?
Jimmy: WARREN BEATTY.
EXACTLY. SO SHE CALLED A FRIEND OF HERS WHO HAPPENED TO HAVE KNOWN SOMEONE THAT WORKED FOR HIM WHO GAVE HER A LIST OF ALL THESE THINGS THAT HE ATE AND DRANK. SO HER FRIDGE WAS FULLY STOCKED FULL OF WARREN BEATTY'S FAVORITES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A LITTLE STALKERIE, YEAH.
OKAY, WE JUST WANTED TO YOU NOW -- SHE WAS LIKE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP YOU GET THE PART. YOU KNOW. AND I WAS LIKE, OKAY, I DON'T THINK A SODA'S GOING TO HELP, BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU NEVER KNOW IN THIS DAY AND AGE.
Jimmy: YOU NEVER KNOW. YEAH, YOU NEVER KNOW.
A FRESCA OR COKE COULD REALLY SEAL THE DEAL. SO, HE GETS THERE. AND WE SIT DOWN. HE'S LIKE, DO YOU WANT ANYTHING TO EAT OR DRINK? AND HE'S LIKE JUST A BOTTLE OF WATER. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S LIKE, NOTHING? AND SHE LISTS OFF EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: HOW ABOUT I CALL FRESCA. MAYBE THAT WILL DO THE TRICK.
AND HE JUST, HE JUST -- YOU KNOW, HE JUST DIDN'T EVEN EVER TOUCH THE WATER BOTTLE, SO.
Jimmy: WAS IT WORTH ALL THAT FOOD?
ALL OF THAT FOOD IS STILL IN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EXACTLY, YOU FRAMED IT. BUT CONGRATS ON THE FILM.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S SUCH A GIANT FILM AS WELL AND SO MANY STARS IN THE MOVIE.
YEAH. IT'S A CRAZY CAST.
Jimmy: BUT IT'S EXCITING TO WATCH. YEAH, IT'S REALLY -- EVERY OTHER SCENE, SOMEONE ELSE POPS UP, YOU GO, OH, MY GOSH! I LOVE THAT PERSON. I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP. HERE'S LILY COLLINS IN "RULES DON'T APPLY." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
I FEEL OLD.
OLD?
I MEAN, WOULDN'T YOU SAY IN HOLLYWOOD AS A RULE, WHEN YOU'VE BEEN HERE AS LONG AS I HAVE, THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE ALREADY MORE OR LESS SHOWN WHAT YOU CAN DO? LET'S BE HONEST, MAYBE I'M NOT THE RIGHT GIRL FOR THIS. I MEAN, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO HAVE BIG BOSOMS AND BE SEXY AND CASUAL ABOUT EVERYTHING? I'M A SQUARE. I CAN'T REALLY ACT. I CAN'T DANCE. I CAN WRITE SONGS BUT I CAN'T REALLY SING. A MOVIE ACTOR SHOULD SING SONGS NOT WRITE THEM. WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT'S TRUE? I MEAN, AS A RULE, I MEAN, IN THIS TOWN, AREN'T THOSE THE RULES?
WHAT?
COME ON FRANK, YOU KNOW THE RULES.
YOU'RE AN EXCEPTION. THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU ARE CRUSHING IT RIGHT NOW, BOTH OF YOU GUYS. CONGRATS TO BOTH OF YOU. LILY COLLINGS. "RULES DON'T APPLY" IS IN THEATERS, NOVEMBER 23rd. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A A PERFORMANCE FROM MARTHA WAINWRIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
