Jimmy: IT'S KIND OF A BUMMER SONG TO PICK ON NEW YEARS EVE.
THAT'S A LEADBELLY SONG. LIKE A TRADITIONAL AMERICAN SONG.
Jimmy: YEAH. SEE AGAIN, WE DIDN'T KNOW -- I DIDN'T ANY OF THIS STUFF UNTIL I SAW YOU GUYS. I JUST LOVE THAT. AND SEEING YOU ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." IS THIS TRUE? LIKE, DIDN'T KURT GET A PHONE CALL FROM LIKE, WEIRD AL YANKOVIC.
YEAH, I REMEMBER. WE WERE IN THE DRESSING ROOM. AND THERE WAS THE ONE GIRL. I CAN'T REMEMBER HER NAME BUT IT WAS A CAST MEMBER. SHE WAS LIKE, "MY FRIEND WEIRD AL WANTS TO TALK TO YOU GUYS." AND HE CALLED INTO THE DRESSING ROOM TO ASK IF IT WAS COOL IF WE COULD DO THE "TEEN SPIRIT" PARODY.
Jimmy: AND WHAT DID YOU DO?
WE SAID YES! IT'S WEIRD AL YANKOVIC! IT WAS AMAZING. [ APPLAUSE ] AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT.
Jimmy: IT TURNED OUT FANTASTIC.
YEAH.
HE PLAYS ACCORDION.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND I HAVE TO ASK TO WHILE I HAVE YOU HERE, WHAT WAS IT LIKE PLAYING WITH A A PAUL McCARTNEY? WAS THAT JUST A DREAM?
YOU KNOW, PAUL IS NOT ONLY THE NICEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. AND HE'S NOT ONLY A BEATLE. BUT HE IS AN INCREDIBLE MUSICIAN.
Jimmy: OH YEAH.
AND SO I MEAN, SOMETIMES YOU FORGET THAT HE COULD BE THE MOST BAD ASS BASS PLAYER YOU HAVE EVER SEEN IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND HE JUST WANTS TO JAM.
Jimmy: YEAH, HE CAN JUST RIP.
HE JUST WANTS TO RIP.
I'M SO GLAD HE DIDN'T PLAY BASS WHEN HE WERE PLAYING.
Jimmy: REALLY WHY?
BECAUSE HE JUST SMOKES ON THE BASS AND I LEARNED EVERYTHING I KNOW FROM HIM.
Jimmy: OH REALLY? YEAH, YOU WERE INTIMIDATED BY HIM?
YEAH.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YOU KNOW, HE COMES IN AND HE'S PLAYING THIS LEFT HANDED FIDDLE. HE PLAYED THIS GUITAR. IT'S LIKE THIS LITTLE GUITAR MADE OUT OF A CIGAR BOX.
Jimmy: WHY DID HE CHOOSE THAT?
HE WAS STANDING THERE. HE WALKS IN THE STUDIO. AND HE HAD HIS LEGENDARY LES PALL GUITAR, THE BASS THAT HE'S PLAYED ON EVERYTHING, AND THIS CIGAR BOX THING AND HE'S LIKE, "NO, I THINK I'LL JUST PLAY THIS." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LIKE, "ARE YOU SURE? LIKE, YOU'RE PAUL McCARTNEY." HE'S LIKE, "I THINK I WANT TO PLAY THE KAZOO."
BUT HE TORE IT UP. THAT'S THE THING! [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE LIKE, OH MY GOD!
Jimmy: I DON'T WANT YOU PLAY THE KAZOO, YOU'RE PAUL McCARTNEY. YEAH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HE WANTED TO JAM OUT.
HE SHOT ME A RIFF. AND I PICKED IT UP. AND I SHOT HIM A RIFF. AND HE PICKED IT UP. AND DAVE IS JAMMING AND PAT IS THERE. AND THEN I LOOK AROUND AND I'M LOOKING AT THE DAVE AND PAT. AND I'M LIKE, "I FORGOT ABOUT PAUL." AND LIKE, I HAVEN'T PLAYED HAVEN'T PLAYED WITH THESE FELLAS FOR 20 YEARS." SO IT'S KIND OF BITTERSWEET. AND HERE IS THIS LEFT HANDED GUITAR PLAYER STANDING THERE. IT WAS A TRIP.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. HE WAS LEFT HANDED.
HE WAS LEFT HANDED.
Jimmy: I THINK I READ SOMEWHERE THAT YOU GO TO PAWNSHOPS NOW THEN YOU LOOK AT LEFT HANDED GUITARS FOR HUNDRED DOLLARS OR LESS AND YOU THINK ABOUT KURT AND BUYING ONE FOR HIM BECAUSE HE WOULD JUST SMASH HIS GUITAR.
YEAH, WE WOULD DO THAT AND BUY A LEFT HANDED GUITAR OR A RIGHT HANDED GUITAR THAT WE COULD FLIP OVER EASILY.
OH YEAH.
Jimmy: I CAN'T SMASH A GUITAR. I TRIED TO DO IT ONCE. OF COURSE I'M A COMEDIAN, FIRST.
THEY'RE HARD TO BREAK.
Jimmy: THEY'RE REALLY HARD TO BREAK. AND I JUST KEPT SMASHING IT AND HITTING IT AND EVERYONE WAS LIKE, LAUGHING AT ME AND NOTHING WAS HAPPENING. THE GUITAR WAS PERFECTLY FINE. I WAS LIKE -- I WAS GRUNTING LOUDER -- I WAS TRYING TO SMASH. AND EVERYONE'S LIKE, "YOU ARE SO NOT A ROCK STAR, DUDE. STOP DOING THIS." THIS I WAS LIKE, "WHATEVER." JUST UNPLUGGED IT.
PETE TOWNSHEND JUST WALKED OUT.
Jimmy: PETE TONWSHEND, YEAH. -- LIKE, I'M LEAVING. YOU'D SMASH EVERYTHING? YOU JUST LOVED TO DO IT? IT WAS FUN?
WELL, IT WOULD MAKE OUT SET LIKE SENSATIONAL. AND THEN WE'D PLAY FOR 45 MINUTES. MAYBE 50 MINUTE BECAUSE KURT WAS SO INTENSE, YOU KNOW? AND HE'D BE UP THERE INTENSE FOR LIKE, 45, 50 MINUTES AND WE COULD GET OFF IF WE SMASHED EVERYTHING. THEN WE PLAY LIVE SHOWS LIKE TWO HOURS.
Jimmy: THAT'S TRUE. YOU CAN'T PLAY AN ENCORE IF EVERYTHING'S BROKE. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: GENIUS!
GENIUS.
Jimmy: GENIUS IDEA!
IT WAS KIND OF A SHTICK. BUT THEN WE PLAYED LIVE SHOWS FOR LIKE, TWO HOURS.
THERE WAS ONE -- WE WERE ON TOUR IN CHICAGO AND KURT HAD BEEN CHOPPING AT MY DRUMS ALL TOUR. AND MY DRUMS HAVE HOLES IN THEM. AND THEY SOUNDED LIKE CRAP BECAUSE THERE WERE HOLES IN THEM. THEY DIDN'T SOUND GOOD. AND I KEPT ASKING OUR TOUR MANAGER, COULD I PLEASE GET A A NEW DRUM SET AND THIS IS BEFORE WE WERE PLAYING BIG PLACE. WE'RE IN CLUBS. HE'S LIKE, LET'S WAIT ANOTHER WEEK. AND HE'D CHOP MORE HOLES IN IT. WAIT ANOTHER WEEK. AND FINALLY I SAID TO KURT AT THE METRO IN CHICAGO. I SAID, "HEY MAN. AT THE END OF THE GIG, WE HAVE TO SMASH DRUM SET TO SPLINTERS. BECAUSE I NEED A GOOD ONE." A REAL ONE.
A RECORD INDUSTRY GUY WAS THERE. THE RECORD LABEL GUYS WAS THERE. SO HE COULD BUY IT. HE HAD THE CREDIT CARDS. HE HAD THE MONEY.
BUT -- WE SPENT A HALF HOUR BREAKING THOSE DRUMS. AND WE TOLD THE AUDIENCE, "YOU CAN GO HOME IT'S ALL GOOD."
Jimmy: WE'RE JUST GOING TO BREAK ALL THIS. THE CONCERT IS OVER.
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY THE DRUM PLACE WAS CLOSED. I WAS LIKE, OH MAN.
Jimmy: YOU'RE SITTING THERE, PLAYING THE KAZOO. YEAH. NIRVANA. WELL IT CAN'T BE MORE HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS. I KNOW ALL THE FANS ARE HAPPY FOR YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PROUD OF YOU.
