THIS IS IT. THIS IS "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. YOU MADE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE HAVE LOTS TO TALK ABOUT. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. FIRT, NEXT MONDAY, EVERYBODY, IS THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. OKAY? IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT'S RIGHT. TWO HOURS OF A 68-YEAR-OLD WOMAN ARGUING WITH A A 70-YEAR-OLD MAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH REMINDS ME, I NEED TO CALL MY PARENTS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "PUT THE LEFT-OVERS IN THE FRIDGE!" "HUH?" "PUT 'EM IN THE FRIDGE." "TAKE A LEFT OFF THE BRIDGE?"

SO, FINALLY A WAY TO SEE TRUMP SAY SOMETHING REALLY CRAZY ON TWITTER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, WHAT WOULD THAT BE LIKE? I SAW THAT ON MONDAY DONALD TRUMP MET WITH THE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT IN NEW YORK CITY WHILE HE'S IN TOWN FOR THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY. TRUMP SAID HE'S ALWAYS FELT CONNECTED TO EGYPT, MOSTLY BECAUSE TRUMP UNIVERSITY WAS A A HUGE PYRAMID SCHEME. AND -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY-O!
Jimmy: THE BIG STORY IS THAT TRUMP'S BEING CRITICIZED FOR USING MONEY FROM HIS CHARITY TO PAY OFF HIS OWN LEGAL FEES. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] I DON'T THINK TRUMP IS TOO CONCERNED, THOUGH. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID AT A A RALLY IN NORTH CAROLINA YESTERDAY.
IT'S CALLED "OPM," I DO ALL THAT TIME IN BUSINESS. IT'S CALLED OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE DOING THINGS WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH. HE CALLS IT "OPM." THEN TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID "FML." THIS IS PRETTY EMBARRASSING. I READ THAT HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN WAS AT THE AIRPORT AND DIDN'T RECOGNIZE A A THREE-YEAR CONGRESSWOMAN FROM MASSACHUSETTS. AND EVEN ASKED HER, "SO WHAT DO YOU DO?"
