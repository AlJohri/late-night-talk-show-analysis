Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH, GUYS. OH, MY GOODNESS. WHAT A GREAT CROWD HERE. A GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. A GOOD LOOKING CROWD.
Steve: WOW, GORGEOUS.
Jimmy: YEAH. WELCOME! WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IT'S A GREAT SHOW. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT, FIRST OF ALL. BIG NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON -- THERE ARE REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS FINALLY FOUND A NOMINEE TO REPLACE DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK HAGEL. HIS NAME IS ASHTON CARTER. HE SOUNDS LESS LIKE A DEFENSE SECRETARY AND MORE LIKE A A MEMBER OF A BOY BAND. [ LAUGHTER ] "I LOVE ASHTON. HE'S MY FAVORITE. HE HAS JUICY-JUICE LIPS AND HE'S JUST SO COMPLICATED AND SO DEFENSIVE." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. OBAMA HAD A HARD TIME FINDING SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY WANTED TO BE DEFENSE SECRETARY. I THINK I CAN SEE WHY. I MEAN, HERE'S CHUCK HAGEL WHEN HE STEPPED DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HERE'S ROBERT GATES RIGHT AFTER HE STEPPED DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE A FEELING THAT STEP DOWN IS A LOT STEEPER THAN IT LOOKS. LIKE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LAWYER GOING, "HAVE YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVED BEEN HURT BY THE PRESIDENT? WE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. CALL 1-800 -- WE CARE ABOUT YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] LISTEN TO THIS. A POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE TRYING TO RAISE MONEY FOR A A 2016 HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS SELLING "READY FOR HILLARY" CHAMPAGNE GLASSES AND CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS. BECAUSE IF ONE THING IMPROVES THE HOLIDAYS, IT'S DRINKING MIXED WITH POLITICS. IT'S JUST GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] "I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS COUNTRY." CHECK THIS OUT -- THIS WEEK, AMAZON ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL BEGIN USING MORE THAN 15,000 ROBOTS TO HELP SHIP HOLIDAY GIFTS THIS YEAR. IT SAYS IT'S MORE EFFICIENT. IT WILL MAKE WORKERS' JOBS EASIER. TAKE A LOOK AT THESE THINGS.
THEY PICK UP AND MOVE SHELVES FULL OF TOYS, BOOKS AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO PACKERS. THE ROBOTS NEED MINUTES TO DO WHAT USED TO TAKE HUMAN BEINGS HOURS.
Jimmy: THESE ROBOTS MAKE IT EASIER FOR EVERYONE. IN FACT, WE'RE GIVING ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES THE REST OF THEIR CAREER OFF! [ LAUGHTER ] "HAPPY HOLIDAYS, DON. YOU'VE BEEN REPLACED BY ROOMBA." YOU CAN'T EVEN SMOKE IN HERE! THAT'S ILLEGAL! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OOH, A LITTLE CONTROVERSY HERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IN A NEW INTERVIEW, CHRISTIAN BALE SAID THAT GEORGE CLOONEY SHOULD STOP WHINING ABOUT BEING HOUNDED BY PAPARAZZI. THIS IS THE WORST FIGHT I'VE SEEN BETWEEN TWO BATMANS SINCE EVERY TIME I WALK THROUGH TIMES SQUARE. [ LAUGHTER ] "THIS IS MY CORNER. YOU'RE THE BATMAN ON 46th."
Steve: "THIS IS MY CORNER. THIS IS MY CORNER." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S BANE.
Jimmy: STAY OUT OF THIS, BANE. BANE, STAY OUT OF THIS. LET ME FIGHT MY OWN BATTLE. "I CAN ACTUALLY BE ON THIS CORNER AS WELL." [ LAUGHTER ] BANE.
Steve: BANE OF MY EXISTENCE.
Jimmy: DID YOU SEE DURING A A RECENT INTERVIEW, STEPHEN HAWKING SAID THAT HIS COMPUTERIZED VOICE WOULD MAKE HIM A GREAT EDITION TO A A JAMES BOND MOVIE. THOUGH, WEIRDLY, HE SAID ALSO THE SAME THING ABOUT THE "FIFTY SHADES OF GREY" MOVIE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ MIMICKING STEPHEN HAWKING ] "I HAVE BEEN A BAD BOY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M KIND OF INTO IT. I KIND OF LIKE IT. GET THIS -- PIZZA HUT HAS DEVELOPED -- PIZZA HUT, THEY'RE ALWAYS THINKING OF SOMETHING NEW. THEY'VE DEVELOPED AN EYE-TRACKING APP THAT ORDERS A A PIZZA BASED ON WHAT MENU ITEMS A CUSTOMER IS LOOKING AT ON THEIR WEBSITE. YEAH, OR AS CUSTOMERS PUT IT, "UGH, YOU MEAN WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO OPEN THE APP? I MIGHT AS WELL MAKE A PIZZA MYSELF." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IF PIZZA IS NOT YOUR THING, I READ ABOUT A BROTHER AND SISTER IN MINNEAPOLIS WHO ARE OPENING THE WORLD'S FIRST VEGAN BUTCHER SHOP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH, AT THE VEGAN BUTCHER, THEY PROMISE TO KILL ALL THE FLAVOR BUT IN A HUMANE WAY. IF YOU BOIL IT LONG ENOUGH, THERE'S NO FLAVOR. IT TASTES LIKE NOTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS ISN'T GOOD HERE, YOU GUYS. RANDOM HOUSE IS FACING CRITICISM FOR PUBLISHING A A SEXIST CHILDRENS BOOK CALLED "I CAN BE A COMPUTER ENGINEER" WHERE BARBIE SAYS SHE NEEDS HER MALE FRIEND'S HELP TO FINISH MAKING A COMPUTER GAME. YEAH. IN A STATEMENT, RANDOM HOUSE APOLOGIZED TO ANY WOMEN WHO ARE OFFENDED BY THE BOOK, AS WELL AS THE MEN WHO HAD READ IT TO THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE REALLY SORRY. THIS IS INTERESTING. ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, THE LARGER THE AGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARRIED COUPLES, THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO GET A A DIVORCE. OR AS GOLD DIGGERS CALL THAT, THE POINT. [ LAUGHTER ] "HERE'S MY HUSBAND, Y'ALL. HE LOVES APPLESAUCE AND SURPRISES! BOO! HE DIED. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK AT MY RING, Y'ALL. OH, HE'S STILL ALIVE. HE'S SO SWEET." [ LAUGHTER ] I READ THAT AFTER A SERIES OF CELEBRITY HACKING SCANDALS THIS YEAR, MANY STARS HAVE SWITCHED TO RETRO FLIP PHONES TO HELP PROTECT THEIR PRIVACY. YEP, EXPERTS ARE CALLING IT BAD NEWS FOR HACKERS AND AMAZING NEWS FOR RADIO SHACK. WE'RE BACK, WE'RE BACK, BABY! I LOVE IT! [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK EXECUTIVE ACTION TO ENACT HIS OWN IMMIGRATION POLICY, AND REPUBLICANS ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESPOND. YOU KNOW, I WAS GOING TO MAKE A A JOKE ABOUT THIS STORY, BUT I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS A JOKE. I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SLOW JAMMED. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, TARIQ? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Tariq: YEAH, JIMMY. I THINK YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT TO SLOW JAM THIS NEWS.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. I WANT TO SLOW JAM THE NEWS, AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: I THOUGHT THERE WERE ALREADY -- WE PLACE NUTS IN EVERY DRESSING ROOM.
I KNOW, BUT SHE BROUGHT ME HERS. HERS ARE BETTER THAN MINE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SHE IS REESE WITHERSPOON. I MEAN, PLEASE, YEAH. I MEAN, WE GIVE YOU THE CRAPPY NUTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH YEAH.
Jimmy: YESTERDAY'S NUTS. DOT COM. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S MY BUSINESS.
I'M NOT A SNAPPY DRESSER BUT I WENT TO TOKYO WITH MY SISTER AMY AND SHE CAN TALK ME INTO ANYTHING.
Jimmy: YEAH, I LOVE AMY SEDARIS.
AND SO SHE TALKED ME INTO THESE. THEY'RE CULOTTES. [ CHEERS ] SO THEY'RE JUST LIKE, BELL-BOTTOMED SHORTS.
Jimmy: PEOPLE LIKE THEM. THIS IS GOING TO START A TREND.
DON'T MEAN TO --
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW THIS MONTH, BUT, I MEAN, EVENTUALLY IN THE SUUMMERTIME. SO SHE JUST -- DO YOU DO EVERYTHING YOUR SISTER TELLS YOU TO DO?
SHE TALKED ME INTO A PAIR OF TROUSERS THAT COME UP TO MY NIPPLES. THEY COME UP TO HERE. AND THEY WERE REALLY EXPENSIVE BUT IT'S A LOT OF FABRIC. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE PAYING PER SQUARE INCH, YES.
BUT IF YOUR TROUSERS COME UP TO YOUR NIPPLES AND PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU LIKE THAT. SO YOU HAVE TO COVER IT UP WITH A VEST AND THEN A JACKET. IT WINDS UP BEING A LOT OF CLOTHES.
Jimmy: YOU JUST GET EXHAUSTED JUST UNZIPPING THE ZIPPER. IT'S JUST -- [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT WHEN I MY HANDS IN THE POCKETS THEY COME UP TO HERE.
Jimmy: THAT'S PRETTY FUN. THAT'S COOL. I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU LIVED IN ENGLAND, IS THAT CORRECT?
YES, I LIVE IN ENGLAND NOW.
Jimmy: YOU LIVE IN ENGLAND. DO YOU LIKE TO TRAVEL? DID YOU LIKE COMING TO THE STATES? DO YOU SEE YOUR FAMILY? SO YOU --
I CAME HERE -- I WENT TO 47 CITIES IN 49 DAYS AND I FINISHED THE DAY BEFORE THANKSGIVING.
Jimmy: NO WAY! IS THAT EXHAUSTING?
I LOVE IT?
Jimmy: YOU DO?
OH YEAH.
Jimmy: OH I WOULD BE EXHAUSTED.
OH, NO --
Jimmy: NO, I WOULD. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T KNOW ME. I'M ME. I WOULD BE. LIKE, YOU WOULN'T. UNLESS I WAS TRAVELING WITH YOU. WHAT DO YOU LIKE, YOU BRING SOME GORP WITH US. AND GO AROUND. GOOD OLD RAISINS AND PEANUTS.
OH, IS THAT WHAT GORP IS?
Jimmy: YOU NEVER HAVE GORP?
NO, I DON'T THINK I HAVE.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. IT'S BETTER THAN CULOTTES. [ LAUGHTER ] 47 CITIES IN 49 DAYS IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
WELL I DO IT TWICE A YEAR.
Jimmy: YOU DO?
AND, UH. EVERY FALL AND EVERY SPRING. AND I, IT'S A LECTURE TOUR. SO I READ IN THEATERS.
Jimmy: YOU'RE SO GOOD AT THAT.
AND I SIGN BOOKS AFTERWARDS. BUT I KNEW THAT I'D BEEN DOING IT FOR TOO LONG ON THIS TOUR. I STARTED TO SAYING TO PEOPLE WHAT DO I SMELL. ARE YOU WEARING HAND LOTION FROM -- AND I COULD IDENTIFY HAND LOTION FROM A CERTAIN CHAIN STORE. AND I WOULD SAY --
Jimmy: YESTERDAY'S NUTS DOT COM.
YOU SHOULD NEVER --
Jimmy: THEY HAVE GREAT LOTIONS. WAIT, SO YOU REALLY --
I STARTED SCOLDING PEOPLE FOR WEARING CHEAP HAND LOTION.
Jimmy: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE IT GIVES ME A A HEADACHE. YOU KNOW THE KIND THAT MAKES PEOPLE SMELL LIKE A YANKEE CANDLE?
Jimmy: YES.
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YES. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I START TELLING PEOPLE THEIR NAMES WERE STUPID.
Jimmy: NO! YOU STARTED LOSING YOUR MIND. YOU STARTED LOSING YOUR MIND.
I DID. BUT I WAITED UNTIL THE VERY END. BUT I WORKED -- I WORKED ON, THERE'S THIS ORGANIZATION THAT GETS PEOPLE TO DONATE BONE MARROW. AND THEY'RE REALLY CLEVER BECAUSE THEY GO TO ROCK CONCERTS AND THEY GET PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T NORMALLY THINK ABOUT DOING IT.
Jimmy: SURE.
THEY GET DRUNK PEOPLE, AND PEOPLE ON DRUGS TO SIGN THEIR NAME SO THEY'LL DONATE BONE MARROW.
Jimmy: YEAH. I MEAN YOU WOULDN'T THINK ABOUT GOING TO YOU KNOW, LOLLAPALOZA AND YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK WITH A LITTLE LESS MARROW THAN YOU WENT IN WITH.
THEY DON'T IT THERE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, THEY DON'T DO IT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A CONCERT IN YEARS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO ANYMORE. "YOU GOTTA GO TO THE BONE MARROW TENT, MAN. EVERYONE'S DOING IT. IT'S AWESOME." [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THEY CAME TO A LOT OF SHOWS.
Jimmy: OKAY.
SO I TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO DONATE BONE MARROW.
Jimmy: OH GREAT. THAT'S REALLY COOL THAT YOU DO THAT.
WELL I TOLD PEOPLE, I SAID OH, IT DOESN'T HURT. YOU'RE THINKING OF THE OLD BONE MARROW THING. YOU KNOW. YOU'RE THINKING 30 YEARS AGO IT HURT. APPARENTLY IT'S EXCRUCIATING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AT ALL.
NO.
Jimmy: BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THE GOOD DEED AND THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU. I LIKE THAT.
YEAH, BUT THEN, LIKE, YOU CAN'T DONATE BONE MARROW IF YOU'RE OVER 55.
Jimmy: ALRIGHT.
SO THEN THIS WOMAN COMPLAINED THAT I WAS BEING AGEIST. BECAUSE EVERYONE THERE WAS LIKE I WAS ALLOWING YOUNG PEOPLE -- BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I SAID IF YOU LOOK GOOD IN A BIKINI AND CAN PROVE IT, YOU CAN COME TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE.
Jimmy: NO YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. NO. YOU JUST SAID HEY, IT'D BE A A GOOD THING.
DONATING BONE MARROW.
Jimmy: YEAH. SHE WAS LIKE, THAT'S AGEIST LEAVE ME ALONE. CAN'T DO IT. YOU JUST BUMMED ME OUT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SHE BUMMED ME OUT.
Jimmy: SHE BUMMED YOU OUT. SHE PROBABLY SMELLED LIKE HAND LOTION. [ LAUGHTER ] GET OUT OF HERE. I LIKE THAT YOU DO THAT AND YOU TALK TO PEOPLE. YOU GET OUT THERE. THAT'S HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK, WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING. "LET'S EXPLORE DIABETES WITH OWLS." [ LAUGHTER ] CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT AT ALL? OR IS IT --
OH I WAS ON A -- I COME UP WITH WHAT TO SIGN IN PEOPLE'S BOOKS. BUT JUST SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE A A LITTLE BIT BOSSY AND THIS WOMAN WANTED ME TO WRITE TO HER DAUGHTER "EXPLORE YOUR POSSIBILITIES." AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I WOULD WRITE. SO I SAID --
Jimmy: SHE TOLD YOU WHAT TO WRITE?
OH THAT HAPPENS A LOT.
Jimmy: REALLY?
BUT I SAID --
Jimmy: EXPLORE YOUR POSSIBILITY.
YEAH. I SAID I'LL KEEP THE WORD EXPLORE. SO I JUST WROTE --
Jimmy: A LITTLE NEGOTIATION. YEAH.
EXPLORE.
Jimmy: MM-HMM.
"DIABETES," AND I THOUGHT I'M NOT DONE YET. "WITH OWLS," AND I THOUGHT THAT'S THE TITLE OF MY NEXT BOOK.
Jimmy: EXPLORE DIABETES WITH OWLS. AND DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA WHAT YOUR NEXT BOOK TITLE'S GOING TO BE?
I WAS IN SCOTLAND AND I WENT TO A MUSEUM AND THIS GUY FROM THE 18th CENTURY HE WAS LIKE, COLLECTS, TRAVELES AROUND THE WORLD AND COLLECTED ODD THINGS. AND SO IN THIS MUSEUM I FOUND A A JAR. I FOUND A BIRD, TWO BIRDS IN JARS WITH YELLOW LABELS. AND ONE OF THE LABELS SAID THE TESTICLES OF AN OLD SPARROW IN APRIL. AND THE OTHER ONE SAID THE TESTICLES OF AN OLD SPARROW IN WINTER.
