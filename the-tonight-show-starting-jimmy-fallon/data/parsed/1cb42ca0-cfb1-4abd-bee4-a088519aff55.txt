Jimmy: I WANNA TALK ABOUT, YOU WERE GREAT IN "NEIGHBORS." I GO, "WHO IS THIS KID?" OH, MY GOSH, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW. YOU WERE FANTASTIC.
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: FANTASTIC JOB IN THE MOVIE. FIRST MOVIE FOR YOU, RIGHT?
FIRST MOVIE. IT WAS FIRST MOVIE.
Jimmy: YOU HIT A HOME RUN, MAN.
IT WAS REALLY FUN, YEAH. THEN I'M LIKE, "YEAH, NO MORE MOVIES."
Jimmy: THAT'S IT, YEAH.
LET'S JUST STOP. IT WAS SO FUN.
Jimmy: STOP WITH "NEIGHBORS." YOU CAN'T TOP THAT.
IT WAS SUCH A FUN EXPERIENCE. IT WAS REALLY GREAT.
Jimmy: NOW YOU'VE GOT AN HBO SPECIAL.
YEAH. HBO SPECIAL CAME OUT, YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE DREAM FOR EVERY COMEDIAN. YOU GO, "OH, MY GOSH." EVEN JUST THE FACT YOU GET TO BE PAID TO BE A COMEDIAN IS THE BIGGEST DREAM.
IT'S CRAZY.
Jimmy: AND THEN TO GET AN HBO SPECIAL ON TOP OF THAT. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT SPIKE LEE DIRECTED IT?
SPIKE LEE.
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU GET SPIKE LEE TO --
HE DID THE OPENING CREDITS FOR THE SHOW.
Jimmy: HE DID OUR SHOW.
IT WAS REALLY GREAT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
HE'S GREAT. I GOT A PHONE CALL, AND --
Jimmy: HE'S THE COOLEST.
HE LEFT A VOICE MAIL WHERE HE SAID HIS NAME 12 TIMES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I GOT THE SAME THING.
DID YOU GET THE SAME THING? HE WAS LIKE, "JERROD, IT'S SPIKE LEE. SPIKE LEE SPIKE LEE." [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, IN CASE YOU WERE CONFUSED. YOU THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE AN ASIAN DUDE, LIKE Y-K-E. NO I.
Jimmy: NO DIFFERENT. L-I.
NO, IT'S THE GENTRIFICATION ONE.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S SPIKE LEE. >>AND, SO. HE SAID HIS NAME A BUNCH. IT WAS GREAT. HE WAS REALLY FUN.
Jimmy: HE'S THE BEST. HE'S THE NICEST, COOLEST GUY EVER. THEN YOU ENDED UP DOING IT -- YOU SHOT IT AT THE COMEDY STORE?
I SHOT AT THE COMEDY STORE, WHICH IS THE FIRST PLACE I EVER DID STAND-UP ACTUALLY.
Jimmy: THAT'S A FUN ROOM. WHICH ROOM?
THE ORIGINAL ROOM.
Jimmy: THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT PLACES, RIGHT?
THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT ROOMS. COMEDY IS GOING ON ANYPLACE IN THE BUILDING. THEY COULD HAVE A ROOM WHERE PEOPLE ARE HAVING MORE FUN RIGHT NEXT DOOR.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I'VE HAD SETS WHERE SOMETIMES YOU JUST HEAR THEM HAVING A GREAT TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'VE BEEN THERE.
YEAH, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: I WAS LIKE, "OH, I WISH I WAS LISTENING TO WHATEVER THEY'RE SAYING."
YEAH, THEY SEEM -- YOU GUYS SHOULD GO OVER THERE.
Jimmy: IT'S FUN WHEN YOU'RE A COMEDIAN.
YEAH, IT'S FUN.
Jimmy: IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOU'RE THERE. HOW DID YOU -- DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR FIRST TIME GETTING UP AT THE COMEDY STORE?
YEAH. IT WAS ON OPEN MIKE. I WENT UP FIRST. THERE'S NO AUDIENCE MEMBERS. THERE'S A GIANT WINDOW WITH WAY MORE INTERESTING THINGS GOING ON OUTSIDE.
Jimmy: ON SUNSET BOULEVARD.
ON SUNSET BOULEVARD. THE SUN SHINING THROUGH.
Jimmy: I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN. THE NEON IN THE WINDOW.
I SAID THE "N" WORD WAY TOO MANY TIMES.
Jimmy: NO, ME TOO. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU TOO? THE SAME THING! I READ ABOUT THAT. I READ ABOUT THAT.
Jimmy: LIKE LOOKING IN A A MIRROR.
I READ ABOUT THAT, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SHOW. YOU HAVE YOUR OWN TV SHOW.
I HAVE A TV SHOW.
Jimmy: ON NBC.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY. I'M ON NBC.
WOW, I WISH MY FATHER REACTED LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS AMAZING.
Jimmy: I REALLY MEAN IT.
THAT WAS AMAZING. ALSO, FIRST WORD IS DADA?
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND IT'S AMAZING YOU HAD A A BOOK JUST READY FOR THE SITUATION.
Jimmy: NO. I WAS GONNA SAY --
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: WE PUSHED IT. WE MADE THIS HAPPEN.
THAT'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
SAME THING HAPPENED IN MY HOUSE. MY FIRST WORDS WERE "AMELIA BADELIA." [ LAUGHTER ] [ BLEEP ] I'M POKING. PEOPLE BELIEVE IT FOR A SECOND.
Jimmy: ME TOO. I GO, "WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD FIRST WORD."
I'M THROWING YOU OFF COURSE. I HAVE A SHOW.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT. IT HAS DAVID ALAN GRIER.<NO VIDE HE'S REALLY FU<NO VIDEO><VIDEO O ACTOR.
Jimmy: HE KNOWS HOW TO ACT. HE'S THE GREATEST. YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM "HI" FOR ME, BECAUSE HE'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT GUY. IT'S BASED ON YOUR FAMILY LOOSELY, RIGHT?
IT'S LOOSELY BASED ON MY FAMILY. WE'RE VERY ARGUMENTATIVE. WE EXPLORE EVERYTHING. WE TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING. SO I WANTED THE SHOW TO BE LIKE A CONVERSATION, YOU KNOW, AND REFLECT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE EVERY DAY. SO IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME TO HAVE JUST, YOU KNOW, A A LOT OF OPINIONS IN ONE'S SPACE. YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, WHETHER YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE, IT'S JUST ABOUT FEELING SOMETHING.
Jimmy: IT'S REALLY FUN. IT'S A FRESH TAKE ON THE SITCOM. IT'S A MULTICAM TOO, WHICH I LOVE. IT'S JUST SO GOOD.
A LOT OF AUDIENCES --
Jimmy: I WANT THAT. I WANT THAT FEELING WHEN I WATCH TV. HERE IS A CLIP OF JERROD CARMICHAEL IN "THE CARMICHAEL SHOW." CHECK THIS OUT.
NO MATTER WHAT HE DID, HE WAS UNARMED. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. AND THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD BE DOWN THERE, JERROD.
SO YOU REALLY THINK PROTESTING MAKES PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS?
YES.
OKAY, THEN WHY DID I SEE GEORGE ZIMMERMAN AT A A DAVE & BUSTERS, MAXINE? AT A DAVE & BUSTERS?
YOU DID NOT SEE GEORGE ZIMMERMAN AT A A DAVE & BUSTERS.
WELL, I COULD HAVE. HE'S FREE ENOUGH TO DO IT. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL I'M SAYING IS PEOPLE GOT ALL UP IN ARMS AFTER TRAYVON DIED, AND GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S NOW RUNNING AROUND THE COUNTRY, IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE FOR PRESIDENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
