THAT'S RIGHT, THE CAVS BEAT THE WARRIORS IN GAME FIVE. [ APPLAUSE ] [ BOOS ] BIG FAN, BIG FAN. LeBRON JAMES AND KYRIE IRVING EACH SCORED 41 POINTS. IRVING SAID HE WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP THE TEAM. THEN LeBRON SAID, "JUST DON'T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT. MEANWHILE, THE WARRIORS STEPH CURRY. WE LOVE STEPH CURRY. HE JUST RELEASED -- [ CHEERS ] DID YOU HEAR THIS? HE JUST RELEASED HIS NEW SHOES FOR UNDER ARMOUR. THESE NEW SNEAKERS. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING -- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? I KNOW YOU'RE A SNEAKER HEAD, YEAH. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY'RE DAD SHOES. JUST SEE WHAT YOU THINK, THIS IS A REAL PICTURE.

I GUESS INSTEAD OF BLOWING OUT HIS CANDLES, HE JUST INSULTED THEM UNTIL THEY PUT THEMSELVES OUT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ AS TRUMP ] "PUT YOU OUT. YOU'RE THE WORST PART OF THIS CAKE." THAT'S RIGHT, TODAY WAS DONALD TRUMP'S 70th BIRTHDAY, SO TO CELEBRATE, HERE'S DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS SINGING "HAPPY BIRTHDAY." ♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME HAPPY BIRTHDAY ♪ ♪ DEAR DONALD TRUMP HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME ♪
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT NICE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT WAS REALLY COOL. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DONALD. ACTUALLY, SINCE IT'S DONALD TRUMP'S BIRTHDAY, WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO GO OVER SOME OF HIS GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS UP UNTIL NOW. TAKE A LOOK. FIRST IN 1946, DONALD TRUMP WAS BORN. IN 1949, USED BLOCKS TO BUILD WALL. MADE NANNY PAY FOR IT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] 1956, BEAT HIS FRIENDS AT MONOPOLY, THEN WROTE HIS NAME ON EVERYONE ELSE'S HOTELS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AFTER THAT, 1976, ACCIDENTALLY INVENTS THE DUCK FACE. LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT, IN 1987, PUBLISHED "ART OF THE DEAL."

Steve: LITTLE FACTUAL, LITTLE FYI. I SAW THAT SUNDAY'S EPISODE OF "KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS" REVEALED THAT KIM, KHLOE, AND KOURTNEY FOUND OUT ROB WAS ENGAGED TO BLAC CHYNA BY READING IT ONLINE. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] IN ROB'S DEFENSE, THAT'S ALSO HOW THE KARDASHIANS FIND OUT THEY'RE EVEN IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, "OMG, TMZ SAYS YOU GUYS WERE ALSO IN THE KITCHEN. WHERE ARE YOU? [ LAUGHTER ] HI. I KNOW YOU'RE HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT YOU'RE HERE. HI." [ LAUGHTER ] GET THIS, YOU GUYS. UBER JUST STARTED LETTING USERS IN SEATTLE RESERVE A RIDE AS FAR AS 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE. THOUGH IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD THAT THEY STILL LET YOU SEE WHERE YOUR DRIVER IS THAT ENTIRE TIME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE, WAIT, TAKING HIS FAMILY TO THE BEACH. I READ THAT THE NASA SPACECRAFT "JUNO" WHICH LAUNCHED IN 2011 IS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE AT JUPITER IN JULY TO TAKE PICTURES OF THE PLANET. WHEN ASKED WHAT KIND OF CAMERA IT BOUGHT, JUNO WAS LIKE, "CRAP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I GOTTA GO BACK AND GET THE CAMERA." AND FINALLY, IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS. THEY JUST PUT OUT NEW SLEEP GUIDELINES FOR BABIES WHICH SAY INFANTS NEED UP TO 16 HOURS OF SLEEP EACH DAY. OR AS THE PARENTS PUT IT, "HEY, TELL THAT TO THE BABY."

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I KEEP -- I GO, DON, BECAUSE I WENT AND I HAD DINNER WITH HIM LAST YEAR, AND I SAID, "YOU CAN COME ON THE SHOW WHENEVER." HE GOES, "YEAH, I WANT TO COME ON THE SHOW BUT I DON'T PLAY PING PONG!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY PING PONG. I MEAN, WE DO GAMES AND WEIRD THINGS SOMETIMES WITH THE GUESTS. WE DON'T DO IT ALL THE TIME. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT." I SAID, "JUST COME ON AND TALK." HE'S LIKE, "WHATEVER. JIMMY KIMMEL OVER HERE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I GO, "STOP CALLING ME JIMMY KIMMEL." HE DID IT ALL NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I TALKED TO HIM. I'M HAPPY HE'S HERE. I'M HAPPY TO HAVE HIM ON THE SHOW. BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO --

EVERY TIME HE WATCHES THE SHOW, HE GOES, "YOU YELL TOO MUCH. WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS YELLING? DON RICKLES IS HERE." YOU KNOW, HE'S SMACKING THE DESK AND HITTING. I GO, "WELL I'M EXCITED THAT YOU'RE HERE." HE GOES, "ALL RIGHT, GET OUT OF HERE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO I JUST WALKED BY HIS DRESSING ROOM. I SAID, "DON, IT'S JIMMY." HE GOES, "WHO CARES?" [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE HERE. BUT HE'S THE GREATEST. I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

YES.
Jimmy: EXPLAIN THIS -- LOOK AT THIS. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] I MEAN, THIS IS ALL BUSINESS.
SO, WE WERE GETTING OUR PICTURE TAKEN. A FAMILY PORTRAIT BY THIS REALLY AMAZING PHOTOGRAPHER. TIMOTHY GREENFIELD SANDERS. AND THEN I WAS PRETTY EXCITED BECAUSE I HAD PURCHASED THIS BLAZER AT DAFFIES? DOES ANYBODY REMEMBER DAFFIES? [ APPLAUSE ] A DISCOUNT SUPER STORE. THIS BLAZER WAS NICOLE MILLER KIDS, AND I REMEMBER IT WAS $49.99, WHICH WAS A REAL -- IT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO SPEND ON A KID IN 1994, OR WHATEVER.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
SO I WAS LIKE, I NEED THIS BLAZER. IT'S GOING TO HELP ME BECOME WHO I AM. MY FATHER HAD GIVEN ME THIS BROOCH WHICH WAS A SYMBOL OF AFRICAN FERTILITY -- [ LAUGHTER ] SO THAT'S A COOL GIFT TO GIVE TO A 7-YEAR-OLD. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I WAS, LIKE, WE FINISHED THE FAMILY PORTRAITS. AND I WAS LIKE, LET ME IN THERE, I'VE GOT SOMETHING I NEED TO DO.
Jimmy: YOU WANTED ONE BY YOURSELF?
I WANTED ONE BY MYSELF AND I WANTED ONE THAT REALLY EXPRESSED WHAT I FELT WHAT MY STATION IN LIFE WAS. WHICH WAS LIKE, MOGUL POWER.
Jimmy: YOU WERE ALL BUSINESS.
MY MOM TOLD ME AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE I REFERRED TO MY BEDROOM AS MY OFFICE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DID?
YEAH, I'D BE LIKE, "HEADING INTO THE OFFICE." THIS BLAZER, I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW, I WOULD WEAR THIS TO SCHOOL WITH A ROTATING ARRAY OF BROOCHES, AND THEN COME HOME AND BE LIKE, "WHY DON'T I HAVE ANY FRIENDS?" [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK IT'S SUPER CLEAR FROM THIS PICTURE.
Jimmy: THIS IS NOT A A 7-YEAR-OLD.
I WAS READING BARBARA STREISAND'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY AT THIS POINT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU WEREALSO REALLY INTO THE THEATER, PUPPET SHOWS.
SO INTO PUPPET SHOWS. TO THE POINT MY PARENTS WERE EXHAUSTED. MY MOM SAYS PEOPLE USED TO FEEL SORRY FOR HER ON THE SUBWAY. BECAUSE WE'D BE RIDING THE SUBWAY AND I'D BE LIKE, "DO YOU WANT TO HEAR MY LONG ISLAND ACCENT? DO YOU WANT TO HEAR MY ITALIAN ACCENT?" SHE'D BE LIKE, "NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR ANY OF IT!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: REALLY, EITHER ONE?
NO.
Jimmy: 'CAUSE I HAVE TWO LITTLE GIRLS NOW. THEY'RE JUST STARTING TO FIGURE OUT PUPPET SHOWS. THEY LOVE IT. IT'S REALLY, REALLY FUN. BUT I'VE NEVER HAD A THEATER IN MY OWN HOUSE. A TEATRO?
MY PARENTS HAD JUST GOTTEN BACK FROM ITALY AND MADE THE CHOICE TO BUILD ME THIS TEATRO.
Jimmy: YOU THINK IT'S A BIG DEAL. BUT IT HAS A TEATRO OF LENA. THEY ALSO -- JUST YOUR FACE. DESCRIBE THE DISGUST OF THIS TEATRO. [ LAUGHTER ]
I WAS PRETTY PEEVED BECAUSE MY SISTER WAS ONE, USELESS, AND I WAS LIKE, "WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD SHE GET HER NAME ON THE TEATRO, WHEN ALL THESE PERFORMANCES ARE 100% ME, CREATIVELY AND OTHERWISE?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I CREATED, PRODUCED, DIRECTED AND STARRED IN MY PUPPET SHOW. THIS IS MY TEATRO!
YES. THIS IS MY TEATRO! I WOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW MY PARENTS TOOK THE TEATRO AWAY AND PUT IT IN STORAGE ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER THEY GAVE IT TO ME. THE BIGGEST THING, THAT I WAS INTO WAS -- I HAD A HAIRLESS CAT AT THIS POINT. GUY, MAY HE REST IN PEACE. ANOTHER ILL-CONCEIVED GIFT FROM MY KIND AND LOVING PARENTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A HAIRLESS CAT?
I HAIRLESS CAT BECAUSE MY MOM'S ALLERGIC. SO SHE GOT ME THIS BEAUTIFUL HAIRLESS CAT. THIS LITTLE PINK CREEPY SWEETIE GUY. AND I GOT IN TROUBLE BECAUSE FOR A ROLE IN THE PUPPET SHOW, I DREW EYEBROWS AND A TOUPEE ON HIM WITH A SHARPIE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I REMEMBER MY DAD SCREAMING, "THE CAT IS NOT A A TOY!" [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THE TEATRO WAS GONE. AND IT TOOK LIKE SIX MONTHS FOR THE SHARPIE -- IT'S HARD TO GET SHARPIE OFF A A CAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT YOUR BUG? THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT THE IDEA TO BE AN ACTRESS AND A WRITER AND A DIRECTOR AND A CREATOR?
DEFINITELY. AND I THINK MY PARENTS WERE LIKE SO DEEPLY INDULGENT. MY MOM JUST RECOVERED A TAPE OF ME AND, LIKE, I GUESS I'M AROUND THIS AGE, AND SHE GAVE ME A CASSETTE PLAYER. AND IT'S ALL ME GOING, "THIS IS LENA DUNHAM'S CAT RADIO HOUR! AN HOUR DEVOTED TO CATS!" [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S LIKE, HORRIFYING. I DID A WHOLE COMMERCIAL FOR SCIENCE DIET. LIKE A WHOLE -- I WAS LIKE, "FEED YOUR CAT SCIENCE DIET. ANYTHING ELSE IS GARBAGE!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU WANTED TO DO IT, MAN. YOU HAD THE VOICE.
I WANTED TO DO IT. I WAS LIKE, MOM, HOW DID YOU STAND THIS? SHE WAS LIKE, "THIS WAS THE BEST BECAUSE YOU WOULD GO ALONE IN A CLOSET WITH A TAPE RECORDER AND I COULD JUST BE BY MYSELF." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. WELL I THINK IT ADDED TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: "SUITED." PLEASE TELL EVERYONE WHAT THIS DOCUMENTARY IS.
WE'RE SO PROUD OF THIS. JENNY KONNER. MY CREATIVE PARTNER AND I HAVE PRODUCED A DOCUMENTARY BY A A DIRECTOR CALLED JASON BENJAMIN, CALLED "SUITED." AND IT'S ABOUT A TAILOR IN BROOKLYN. CALLED BINDLE AND KEEP.
Jimmy: BINDLE AND KEEP?
BINDLE AND KEEP IS THE NAME OF THE TAILOR. I THINK IT SOUNDS VERY SOPHISTICATED.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THEY CREATE CLOTHING FOR TRANS AND GENDER-NONCONFORMING CLIENTS. SO, IT'S ABOUT -- WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT, IS IT'S A A REALLY, YOU KNOW, WE TALK A A LOT ABOUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES THAT ARE FACING THE TRANS COMMUNITY AND I'M SO GLAD WE DO. BUT I LOVE THAT THIS IS A A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A A DAY-TO-DAY WAY IN TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE STRUGGLE. LIKE, WE ALL GOTTA GET DRESSED. LOOK AT YOU, YOU GET UP AND PUT A SUIT ON EVERY DAY. SOME DAYS IT PROBABLY FEELS GOOD AND SOME DAYS WE GO, "I FEEL LIKE GARBAGE."
Jimmy: NOT REALLY. I MEAN -- [ LAUGHTER ] NO I'M JUST KIDDING. OF COURSE, OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
AND WE FORGET HOW MUCH CLOTHING IMPACTS AND INFORMS OUR IDENTITY. AND SO WHEN YOU'RE PART OF A A COMMUNITY WHERE NOBODY IS THINKING ABOUT MAKING CLOTHING SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU, WHEN YOU GET A PIECE OF CLOTHING THAT REALLY FITS YOU, IT'S A REALLY EMOTIONAL MOMENT BECAUSE YOU GET TO REALLY SETTLE IN TO YOUR IDENTITY. AND I GOT TO GET A SUIT MADE BY THEM. AND JUST BY BEING KIND OF A A CHUBBY GIRL IN HOLLYWOOD, I'M NOT COMPARING THAT TO THE CHALLENGING EXPERIENCE OF BEING A MARGINALIZED PERSON IN AMERICA. BUT I MEAN, IN THE WORLD WE WORK IN, HAVING A BUTT IS BASICALLY ILLEGAL. AND SO IT'S REALLY NICE WHEN YOU PUT ON CLOTHES AND THEY FIT. THEY BUILT ME A SUIT AND I WAS LIKE CRYING. 'CAUSE I'M JUST SO USED TO LIKE -- [ BLEEP ] USING -- I JUST CURSED. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M JUST SO USED TO HAVING TO TAKE A PAIR OF PLIERS TO GET MY PANTS ON THAT IT JUST FELT SO GOOD TO PUT ON CLOTHES THAT FIT.
Jimmy: THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A TAILORED SUIT OR ANYTHING TAILORED AT ALL, IT'S A GAME CHANGER. BUT YOU'LL SEE IN THIS CLIP. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S FROM LENA'S NEW DOCUMENTARY "SUITED," WHICH AIRS --
I'M SORRY I CURSED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE JUST HAD DON RICKLES ON THE SHOW. I THINK YOU'LL BE FINE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
I ASKED JUDD APATOW IF I SHOULD ASK MR. RICKLES FOR A A PICTURE. HE SAID YES. AND I SAID, "SHOULD I ASK FOR A A PICTURE WHERE HE'S HOLDING MY BREAST?" AND HE WAS LIKE, "HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO --
NO, HE DOESN'T WANT IT. I DO WANT IT. IT'S COMPLICATED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ANYWAYS, LET'S SHOW A A CLIP FROM LENA'S NEW DOCUMENTARY CALLED "SUITED."
YES.
Jimmy: IT AIRS JUNE 20th ON HBO. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
EVERY CLIENT IS DIFFERENT. I LOVE TO MAKE THEM SUITS AND POTENTIALLY MAKE THEM FEEL AS GOOD AS THEY DESERVE TO FEEL.
THE SHOULDERS?
15 AND A HALF. 11 AND A QUARTER.
IT'S ALL ABOUT JUST FEELING GREAT IN YOUR BODY. ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING THEIR ENTIRE LIVES, AND THEY FINALLY GET INTO SOMETHING THAT REALLY FITS THEM. THAT REALLY FITS THEM THE WAY THEY ALWAYS ENVISIONED SOMETHING WOULD FIT THEM. THAT'S NOT FASHION ANYMORE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AFTER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "SUITED." LENA AND I ARE PLAYING BOX OF LIES WHEN WE COME BACK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. I'M HERE WITH LENA DUNHAM. WE'RE ABOUT TO FACE OFF IN A A GAME OF BOX OF LIES. NOW HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. UPSTAGE THERE ARE A BUNCH OF BOXES CONTAINING OBJECTS NEITHER OF US HAVE SEEN BEFORE. TAKING TURNS, LENA AND I ARE GOING TO SELECT A BOX AND OPEN IT ON OUR SIDE OF THE TABLE, OUT OF VIEW OF THE OTHER PERSON. YOU'LL REMOVE THE OBJECT FROM THE BOX, SHOW IT TO THE AUDIENCE.
