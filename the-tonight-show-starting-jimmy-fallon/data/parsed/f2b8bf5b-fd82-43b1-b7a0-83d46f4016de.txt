[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT. THANK YOU FOR COMING, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, IT'S THE WISCONSIN PRIMARY, WHICH HAPPENED YESTERDAY. AND BERNIE SANDERS WON ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. SANDERS WISCONSIN -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SANDERS WISCONSIN SUPPORTERS CELEBRATED BY DRINKING OLD MILWAUKEE. [ CHEERS ] OR AS BERNIE CALLS IT, YOUNG MILWAUKEE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BERNIE'S WIN LAST NIGHT MARKS THE SIXTH STRAIGHT VICTORY AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. [ CHEERS ] AND WHEN BERNIE RECEIVED A A CONCESSION CALL FROM HILLARY, HIS ASSISTANT SAID -- [ WHISPERING ] BERNIE, THE CALL IS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] BIG NIGHT. BIG NIGHT FOR BERNIE. BUT THE GUY WHO INTRODUCED HIM AT HIS VICTORY RALLY MIGHT HAVE STOLEN THE SHOW. HIS NAME IS JIM HIGHTOWER. HE'S A FORMER AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER FROM TEXAS. AND HE HAD A LOT TO SAY. CHECK THIS GUY OUT.
THOSE POWERS THAT BE, THEY'RE AS CONFUSED AS GOATS ON ASTROTURF. AND BY THE POWERS THAT BE, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DOWNSIZERS AND PRIVATIZERS. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WAL-MART WAGE WHACKERS AND THE BIG OIL FRACKERS. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BOSSES, THE BANKERS, THE BIG SHOTS, THE BASTARDS, AND THE BULL [ BLEEP ]. THEY THINK THEY CAN RUN ROUGHSHOD OVER US. I HEAR -- I HEAR DONNY TRUMP AND I HEAR TED CRUZ. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I HEAR THIS GAGGLE OF GOOFY AND DAFFY AND DOPEY AND GRUMPY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I THINK 100,000 SPERM AND YOU WERE THE FASTEST? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY SAY THAT IN SEX, USING A A FEATHER CAN BE EROTIC. BUT USING BUT USING THE WHOLE CHICKEN, THAT'S JUST NASTY.

[ APPLAUSE ] AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF ICELAND RESIGNED, YESTERDAY, AFTER IT WAS REVEALED THAT HE HAD UNDISCLOSED FINANCES IN THE PANAMA PAPERS LEAK. NOW, ICELANDIC IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST LANGUAGES FOR ENGLISH SPEAKERS TO USE, BUT I THINK THE REPORTERS DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF PRONOUNCING THE PRIME MINISTER'S NAME. TAKE A LOOK.
ICELAND'S PRIME MINISTER HAS ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION. SIGMUNDER DAVID GUNNLAUGSSON.

Jimmy: NO, HE THOUGHT --
HE TOTALLY THOUGHT --
Jimmy: HE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW YOU.

Jimmy: OH MY GOSH.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE, OF COURSE, I WOULD NOT CRAP MY PANTS.

AND BY THE WAY, THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN HE WAS RECOUNTING THIS INCIDENT, HE DID NOT EVEN MENTION THE FACT THAT HE ACTUALLY STEPPED IN THE POOP.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS SO CLOSE TO HIM THE ENTIRE TIME. 'CAUSE HE ACTUALLY -- I REMEMBER HE GOT OFF THE COUCH FROM NEXT TO ME AND WENT AND --

THANKS FOR SENDING THE SUIT OVER FOR ME.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S PERFECT. YOU LOOK GOOD.
GREAT GIFT.
Jimmy: YOU LOOK SHARP. WE LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME. WE'RE DRESSED ALIKE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING.
BEFORE AND AFTER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MUSTACHE, TOO. HEY, I GOT TO JUST SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT YOU. YOU CAN PLUG YOUR EARS IF YOU WANT TO. BUT -- YOU WROTE "SWINGERS" AND YOU ACTED IN IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YES.
Jimmy: ONE OF YOURS -- THAT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU BUT THEN YOU WENT ON TO DIRECT "ELF." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STARRING CHAD SMITH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEN YOU DID "IRONMAN." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DID -- I LOVE EVEN "CHEF." [ APPLAUSE ] AND NOW YOU'RE DOING "THE JUNGLE BOOK" WHICH IS GETTING CRAZY AMAZING REVIEWS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU READ REVIEWS OR CARE, BUT I WANTED TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND JUST ENJOY. YOU'RE A FANTASTIC DIRECTOR, MAN.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'RE DOING IT. THIS IS GREAT.
ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DRINK? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, I WON'T MAKE YOU DO THAT.
LET'S GO DRINK DRINKO. LET'S GET SALSA AND ABSINTHE.
Jimmy: OH GOD, WE'RE SPONSORED BY SALSA VERDE.
YOU GOT TO BE A LITTLE LIGHTHEADED FROM THAT. THAT WAS QUITE A SHOT.
Jimmy: I'M A LITTLE LOOPY RIGHT NOW.
ARE YOU?
Jimmy: YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: BUT -- [ SLURRING SPEECH ] SO THE MOVIE IS SOMETIME THIS WEEKEND, RIGHT?
YES. COMING OUT APRIL 15th. YEAH.
Jimmy: SO APRIL 15TH IT COMES OUT. "THE JUNGLE BOOK", I MEAN, WE KNOW THE CARTOON, EVERYONE FROM MY GENERATION. IF YOU DON'T KNOW, YEAH, CLASSIC. SO YOU GO WHY WOULD YOU EVEN STEP IN THE RING AND TRY TO DO THIS?
LOOK, THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY IS PRETTY AMAZING. I LEARNED A LOT WORKING ON FILMS LIKE "IRONMAN" AND THE QUESTION WAS AFTER SEEING WHAT THEY DO WITH ANIMALS IN FILMS LIKE "PLANET OF THE APES" AND WHAT THEY DID WITH "AVATAR" COULD YOU USE THAT SAME TECHNOLOGY AND RETELL A TALE 50 YEARS LATER THAT STILL HAD HEART AND HUMOR BUT BROUGHT A A LITTLE BIT MORE EXCITEMENT AND MAKE IT PHOTO REAL. AND WE JUST HAD ONE LIVE ACTION KID, NEEL SETHI PLAYING MOWGLI, AND EVERYTHING ELSE, THE ANIMALS, THE JUNGLE, EVERYTHING'S BEEN GENERATED BY ARTISTS AND BY COMPUTERS.
Jimmy: IT'S ABSOLUTELY INSANE. EVERYTHING IS COMPUTERS.
YEAH, YEAH, IT'S PRETTY COOL.
Jimmy: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. YOU WATCH IT AND TOTALLY FORGET THAT THAT'S HAPPENING. OF COURSE, YOU ARE HEARING THE VOICES OF, YOU KNOW, BILL MURRAY AND STUFF.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE WATCHING THESE ANIMALS TALK AND YOU GO. NOW, THAT'S COOL HOW THEY MADE THAT BEAR TALK. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE IS NO BEAR. YOU UNDERSTAND.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: WHAT IS THE KID ACTING AGAINST, A GREEN SCREEN?
ACTUALLY, WE HAD JIM HENSON STUDIOS DESIGN PUPPETS FOR US. DID YOU EVER SEE A KID DEALING WITH A PUPPET? YOU GO ON A SET EVEN FOR GROWN-UP ACTORS, IF YOU HAVE AN X ON AN EYELINE, IT'S HARD TO GIVE A REAL PERFORMANCE BUT THE MINUTE A PUPPETEER COMES ON STAGE, THE KID LIGHTS UP. THE PUPPETEERS WERE ALL GREAT IMPROVISERS. SO WE KEEP IT FRESH BY KEEPING THE PERFORMANCE WITH SOMETHING LIVE ACTION ON SET. AND I THINK YOU SEE IT IN THE KID'S FACE.
Jimmy: DID YOU RECORD THE ACTORS BEFOREHAND?
YEAH. SO WHAT WE DID, WAS I WOULD TAKE NEEL, THE ACTOR. WE GO TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD AND GO TO BILL MURRAY'S PLACE. AND THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER THING IS GETTING BILL MURRAY IN TO BE IN A MOVIE. IT'S NOT LIKE --
Jimmy: HIS VOICE IS CGI. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S NOT ACTING OUT WITH THE REAL BILL MURRAY.
A SOUNDBOARD.
Jimmy" YEAH.
YEAH, SO WE GOT HIM. I PUT THE NOTE IN THE HOLLOW LOG IN THE FOREST.
Jimmy: YOU SUMMONED BILL MURRAY LIKE A BATMAN UP IN THE AIR AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH HE'LL SHOW UP.
HE SHOWED UP AND WE FLEW OUT TO HIM IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD. AND I BROUGHT -- YOU KNOW, I LEARNED HOW TO COOK FROM "CHEF," SO I SMOKED A A BRISKET AND WE BROUGHT IT ON THE PLANE LIKE AN ORGAN TRANSPLANT IN A COOLER. [ LAUGHTER ] KEPT IT HOT ALL THE WAY TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD, MADE HIM DINNER. AND THEN THE NEXT DAY HIM AND THE KID THEY PLAYED -- THEY PLAYED FOOTBALL THEY PERFORMED TOGETHER. AND YOU NEED THAT SPONTANEOUS ENERGY THAT IMPROVISATION THAT BILL MURRAY IS SO WONDERFUL AT. AND THEN WE TAKE ALL THAT, ALL THE FACIAL PERFORMANCE AND GIVE TO IT THE ANIMATORS AND WE WORK THE PERFORMANCE, ALL THE VISUAL STUFF BASED ON THE RADIO PLAY OF WHAT WE PUT TOGETHER FROM THE RECORDINGS.
Jimmy: WOW.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE IN TECHNOLOGY TODAY. IT'S JUST FASCINATING AND AMAZING. WOULD YOU RECOMMEND IMAX OR REGULAR THEATERS? DO YOU CARE?
THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT FORMATS. DEFINITELY 3-D WE SHOT IT IN 3-D. WE USED THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AS THEY USED FOR "AVATAR" WHICH I THOUGHT REALLY SHOWCASED 3-D WELL. SO IT'S NATIVE CAPTURE. IMAX LASER IS GREAT. DOLBY VISION 3-D WHICH IS THE FIRST TIME A FILM IS RELEASED IN THAT FORMAT IS AMAZING. EXTENDED DYNAMIC RANGE IS AVAILABLE IN A FEW CITIES. I'LL POST LIKE A BLOG OR SOMETHING TO RECOMMEND WHATEVER FORMAT. IT'S SO MUCH --
Jimmy: MY LAST THING I WANT TO ASK YOU AND THIS IS A WEIRD QUESTION. DO YOU HAVE A COIN FOR ME?
BECAUSE I GAVE YOU ONE FOR -- ON THE MOVIES I DO, I DO CHALLENGE COINS. IT'S A TRADITION IN THE MILITARY. I GOT A LOT OF THEM FROM THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT. ON "IRONMAN" I WOULD RECEIVE THEM. AND WHEN I WENT BACK FOR "IRONMAN 2" I MADE A COIN TO GIVE OUT TO THE MILITARY PEOPLE AND IT'S BECOME A HANDY THING ON EVERY PROJECT.
Jimmy: I WAS JUST JOKING.
SO HERE'S YOUR "JUNGLE BOOK" COIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU REALLY DID MAKE ONE. YOU ARE THE BEST, BUDDY.
THERE YOU GO.
Jimmy: I LOVE YOU, PAL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP. HERE'S BILL MURRAY, BEN KINGSLEY AND NEWCOMER NEEL SETHI IN "THE JUNGLE BOOK." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S THE HIDING STASH FOR WINTER.
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?
YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T GET MAD.
DID YOU LISTEN TO ANYTHING AKELA TAUGHT YOU? THERE'S NO PLACE IN THE JUNGLE FOR THESE TRICKS. IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS YOU DO IT IN THE MAN VILLAGE.
BUT I'M HELPING BALOO GET READY FOR HIBERNATION.
BEARS DON'T HIBERNATE IN THE JUNGLE. WHAT ARE YOU TEACHING HIM?
NOT FULL HIBERNATION, BUT I NAP, A LOT. [ LAUGHTER ]
