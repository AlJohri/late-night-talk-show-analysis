I GUESS THE FIRST LADY, MICHELLE OBAMA, AND THEIR DAUGHTERS SASHA AND MALIA ARE VISITING CHINA FOR THE NEXT WEEK. SO THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY SAID THAT THE WHITE HOUSE FEELS VERY LONELY WITHOUT THEM. [ AUDIENCE AWWS ] THEN HE SAID, "OKAY, I THINK THEY BOUGHT IT. TIME FOR SOME MARCH MADNESS, BABY! LET'S DO IT! PICTURE IN PICTURE! I WANT TO SEE ALL THE GAMES!" ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN KIND OF TELL OBAMA'S LONELY JUST BY THE TWEETS THAT HE'S BEEN SENDING OUT. LIKE LAST NIGHT HE TWEETED "HEY, MICHELLE OBAMA, HAVING EIGHT PANCAKES, YOU BETTER STOP ME. LLL #KINDOFWISHYOUWOULD. #REALTALK. #LONELYTALK." THEN AN HOUR LATER HE WROTE, "LAYING ON THE FLOOR IN THE OVAL OFFICE, OVAL IS A FUNNY WORD. OVAL, UVAL. #LEGALIZEIT." WHICH IS JUST -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A WEIRD ONE.

CHARLIE WAS LIKE, "IF YOU GUYS WORK REALLY HARD, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT." AND THE TEACHER SAID, "MR. SHEEN, THOSE ARE GOLDFISH. THE CHILDREN ARE OVER HERE." HE SAID, "OH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] DUH. SWIMMING." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS ACTUALLY KIND OF SCARED ME. THIS WEEK, SCIENTISTS REVEALED THAT A MASSIVE SOLAR BLAST NARROWLY MISSED THE EARTH BACK IN 2012.

I DIDN'T NOTICE. AND HE HAD THE HIGH NOTES.
Jimmy: I KNOW, HE'S UNBELIEVABLE. HE'S LIKE -- I'M GOING LIKE "IN THE VILLAGE," I COULDN'T DO IT. AND HE'S DOING IT LIKE IT'S NOTHING. OH, MY GOSH. IT'S SO FUN. I STILL HAVE IT OUT READY TO GO.
I HOPE YOU HAVE IT ALWAYS.
Jimmy: YEAH, GOOD. I'M JUST GOING TO ALWAYS LEAVE IT ON A LOOP. IT'S GONNA BE MY RINGTONE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO EXCITED. NOW, YOU LIVED IN NEW YORK. I RUN INTO YOU AT DIFFERENT EVENTS, STUFF LIKE THAT. CAN YOU GO OUT ANYWHERE? OR ARE YOU JUST TOO RECOGNIZABLE? DO PEOPLE GO "OH, MY GOSH, CHELSEA CLINTON?"
I LOVE LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY. UM, I WALK MY DOG EVERY MORNING. I RIDE THE SUBWAY.
Jimmy: DON'T FEEL RECOGNIZE YOU?
PEOPLE RECOGNIZE ME. MOST PEOPLE ARE REALLY NICE. SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY "HI, CHELSEA." SOMETIMES PEOPLE COME UP AND ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT HEALTH CARE OR SOMETHING ELSE.
Jimmy: IT HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOW AN AUTHORITY SINCE YOU HAD THE FIRST LADY ON.
Jimmy: YEAH. I TOTALLY KNOW, EXACTLY. YEAH.
SO, I HOPE YOU DIRECT EVERYONE TO HEALTHCARE.GOV.
Jimmy: I TOLD EVERYONE TO GO THERE.
AWESOME.
Jimmy: DON'T ASK ME THOSE QUESTIONS, YEAH. GO TO HEALTHCARE.GOV.
GREAT. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
TO THE AUTHORITY.
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, WHEN I RAN INTO YOU WE WERE AT A CHARITY EVENT FOR VICTIMS OF HURRICANE SANDY AND WE WERE BACKSTAGE JUST TALKING ABOUT STUFF. YOU TURNED ME ON TO THIS KOREAN RESTAURANT. DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?
I DO REMEMBER THIS.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE PLACE?
KUM GANG SAN.
Jimmy: KUM GANG SAN, YEAH. I WENT THERE. I WENT THERE WITH MY WIFE. I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL BE AL BACK. IT'S THE BEST FOOD.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
Jimmy: WELL, IT'S NOT -- MY WIFE. SHE DID IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I SWEAR.
THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD.
Jimmy: YEAH, THE MOTHER OF MY CHILD. EXACTLY RIGHT.
YOU JUST OUTED HER.
I KNOW, BUT WE WERE TRYING -- WE WERE TRYING TO HAVE A BABY. WE WERE REALLY IN BABY MODE. MY WIFE LOVES BABIES. THERE WAS THIS REALLY CUTE KOREAN BABY AT THE NEXT TABLE. REALLY CUTE. HE HAD LIKE A LITTLE SKI HAT ON. HE HAD -- MAYBE SEVEN MONTHS OLD. SQUISHY CUTE FACE LIKE THIS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CUTE LIPS. LIKE SO ADORABLE. AND MY WIFE WAS TALKING TO THE BABY GOING "HI, HI." AND THE BABY WAS TALKING BACK TO MY WIFE GOING, "YA. GOO, GOO, GA." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
AS BABIES DO.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW, WHATEVER. THEY WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION AND THE PARENTS GO "YOU CAN HOLD HER IF YOU WANT TO." SO MY WIFE'S LIKE, "OH, I'D LOVE TO." SHE GRABS THE BABY, HOLDS THE BABY AND TALKING TO THE BABY. IT'S REALLY CUTE BABY. HE'S GOING LIKE "YA, YOU" -- SHE'S TALKING TO HIM. SHE GOES, "OH, HE'S SO CUTE," AND KISSES THE BABY ON THE MOUTH. I GO, "NANCY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU CAN'T KISS A STRANGER'S BABY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?"
SHE WAS INSPIRED IN THE MOMENT.
Jimmy: BUT NOW WE HAVE THE BABY. I'M LIKE, "WHAT WOULD I DO IF SOMEBODY KISS MY BABY ON THE MOUTH?" "GET OFF MY BABY." I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE ALLOWED BACK IN THE RESTAURANT. I THINK WE'RE IN TROUBLE. NOW I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOU. WHAT'S GOING ON NOW WITH THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE UNIVERSITY.
THAT'S THIS WEEKEND.
Jimmy: YEP.
AT ARIZONA STATE. IT'S OUR SEVENTH CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE UNIVERSITY. CGIU. WE CALL IT FOR --
Jimmy: CGIU, OKAY.
SHORTHAND.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S MUCH EASIER TO SAY. YEAH.
SO IN THE LAST SIX YEARS WE'VE HAD MORE THAN 5,500 STUDENTS COME FROM MORE THAN 800 UNIVERSITIES ACROSS EVERY STATE. 130 COUNTRIES. AND THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO AREN'T JUST ASPIRING CHANGE MAKERS. THEY'RE ALREADY CHANGE MAKERS ON THEIR CAMPUSES, IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, MAKING A A DIFFERENCE ACROSS THE WORLD.
Jimmy: HOW FUN.
IT IS A LOT OF FUN. SO THEY COME TOGETHER AND THEY MAKE SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS TO ACTION. EITHER TO SCALE WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING OR TO TACKLE A A NEW PROBLEM. AND WE'VE HAD STUDENTS DO EVERYTHING, COMMITTING TO USING SOCCER TO TEACH LOCAL KIDS ABOUT HIV/AIDS, WHAT IT IS, WHAT IT ISN'T.
Jimmy: HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT?
SO WE HELP KIDS REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW TO TRANSLATE THEIR IDEAS INTO ACTIONS. SO HOW DO THEY TAKE SOMETHING THAT IS EPHEMERAL AND MAKE A A REAL BUSINESS PLAN?
Jimmy: YEAH.
EITHER TO START AN NGO OR START A SOCIAL BUSINESS. SOMETIMES IT'S ABOUT DESIGNING A PRODUCT. WE HAD A FEW STUDENTS FROM HARVARD A COUPLE YEARS AGO DESIGN A SOCCER BALL THEY CALLED "SOCK IT" THAT AS KIDS KICKED IT AROUND IT GENERATED AND STORED ELECTRICITY THAT THEN THE KIDS COULD USE LATER TO POWER THEIR LIGHTS TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK AT NIGHT.
Jimmy: REALLY? I HAVE AN INVENTION.
I'M READY.
Jimmy: I WANT OCEAN SPRAY TO MAKE -- YOU KNOW CRANBERRY SAUCE? IT INTO LITTLE SINGLES, LIKE KRAFT SINGLES. THEN YOU COULD PUT IT ON SANDWICHES AFTER THANKSGIVING. YEAH, LIKE YOU PUT LIKE TURKEY SANDWICHES. [ CHEERS ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: CRANBERRY SINGLES.
SO MY HUSBAND, PROBABLY NEXT TO KOREAN BARBECUE, HIS FAVORITE FOOD IS EVERYTHING THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
HE THINKS THANKSGIVING TASTES BETTER THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING.
Jimmy: HE'D LOVE MY IDEA.
HE WOULD LOVE YOU IDEA. THAT'S NOT -- PROBABLY MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR IDEA. THAT'S REALLY NOT WHAT WE MEAN BY COMMITMENT TO ACTION.
Jimmy: AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
NOT AT ALL.
Jimmy: INTERESTING. SO I WOULD NOT BE INVITED TO THE COLLEGE? I WOULD FLUNK THE UNIVERSITY?
NO, WE WOULD JUST TRY TO HELP YOU FIGURE OUT HOW THAT SAME KIND OF IMPETUS TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL PACKAGES MAYBE COULD BE USED FOR GLOBAL HEALTH OR KIND OF ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT.
Jimmy: IT MAKES FOR A REALLY DELICIOUS SANDWICH. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A DIFFERENT COLLEGE WE HAVE TO START.
YOU NEED BOTH.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE EIGHTH YEAR YOU'RE DOING THIS?
IT IS THE SEVENTH YEAR WE'RE DOING THIS.
Jimmy: SEVENTH YEAR YOU'RE DOING THIS. YOU MUST SEE SOME AMAZING STUFF.
WE SEE LOTS OF AMAZING STUFF.
Jimmy: A SOCCER BALL THAT CREATES ELECTRICITY?
IT'S AMAZING. WE HAD A STUDENT NAMED ASHIKI GOGO, TWO YEARS AGO COMMIT TO MAKE AN APP TO ENABLE PEOPLE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD TO TELL THEM WHETHER OR NOT A A DRUG THEY WERE CONSIDERING BUYING WAS COUNTERFEIT OR NOT. ABOUT 25% OF THE DRUGS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD ARE COUNTERFEIT. THEY KILL ABOUT 700,000 PEOPLE EVERY YEAR. AND NOW THIS PRODUCT HAS ROLLED OUT. HE COMMITTED TO BUILD IT. HE BUILT IT. AND THEY NOW HAVE HAD MORE THAN 5 MILLION PEOPLE USE IT TO VERIFY DRUG PURCHASES.
Jimmy: REALLY? TARIQ DOES THAT JOB TOO ON THE WEEKENDS. [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD WEED OR NOT.
WE CAN CONNECT YOU.
Jimmy: OH, THIS STUFF IS REAL. YEAH, YEAH. THIS IS GOOD -- THIS IS GOOD STUFF. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO. NOT WHEN IT'S --
Jimmy: AGAIN, WE CAN'T GO TO THE COLLEGE. THINK ABOUT IT. YOU'RE DOING AWFULLY GOOD STUFF. SINCE YOU'RE A KID YOU'VE BEEN IN POLITICS. HAS ANYONE EVER ASKED YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO RUN FOR OFFICE?
VERY FEW DAYS GO BY WHEN PEOPLE DON'T ASK ME THAT QUESTION. ONE OF MY EARLIEST CHILDHOOD MEMORIES IS BEING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH MY DAD IN ARKANSAS AND BEING 3 YEARS OLD AND WAVING A FLAG BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS MY JOB. RIGHT, I WAS 3, I WAS GOING TO LOOK LIKE SUPER PATRIOTIC.
Jimmy: YEAH, CUTE.
NOT SURE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I'M SURE YOUR DAUGHTER WILL -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EQUIVALENT IS FOR YOU. BUT, SHE'LL BE DOING THAT.
Jimmy: HOLDING UP DVDs OF JOHNNY CARSON OR SOMETHING? I HAVE NO IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, ALL RIGHT. YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT. OR SHE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. AND I HAVE THIS VIVID MEMORY OF A WOMAN COMING UP TO ME AND SAYING, "SO ARE YOU GOING TO GROW UP AND BE THE GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS ONE DAY?" AND I REMEMBER SAYING "I'M 3."
Jimmy: THAT'S A PERFECT ANSWER TO THAT WOMAN. "YEAH, I"M I'M 3 YEARS OLD." BUT STILL -- AND THEN YOU'RE ON THE BALLOT. CONGRATULATIONS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WELL, NO.
