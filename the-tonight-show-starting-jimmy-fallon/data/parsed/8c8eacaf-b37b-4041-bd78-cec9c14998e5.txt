Jimmy: COME ON. ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU, MAN? GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Jimmy: ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU. I WAS JUST SHOWING THIS STUDLY COVER OF "HAMPTONS" MAGAZINE. OOH LA LA. [ CHEERS ] YOU USED TO GROW UP IN THE HAMPTONS, RIGHT? YOU USED TO VACATION THERE.
I USED TO SPEND A COUPLE WEEKS EVERY SUMMER OUT IN MONTAUK AND THEN IN COLLEGE, YOU KNOW, GOT DIFFERENT JOBS OUT THERE CLEANING POOLS, LANDSCAPING.
Jimmy: I LIVED OUT -- I HAVE A PLACE OUT IN THE HAMPTONS AS WELL.
I KNOW. A COUPLE YEARS AGO, I HAVE FRIENDS WHO LIVE ACROSS THE STREET FROM YOU, DOWN THE BLOCK.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEY MENTIONED TO ME THAT YOU BOUGHT THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET. AND I SAID, "OH, YEAH. I KNOW THAT HOUSE." I KNOW IT VERY WELL, BECAUSE IN COLLEGE I MOWED YOUR LAWN." [ LAUGHTER ] OBVIOUSLY, YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT THEN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN LIKE YOUR ATTIC, I PAINTED YOUR ATTIC. THERE IS LIKE A KIDS', LIKE, PLAYROOM UP THERE.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S WHERE I SLEEP. [ LAUGHTER ] ABSOLUTELY. YOU PAINTED THAT?
YEAH, SO I KNOW THAT PROPERTY VERY WELL.
Jimmy: THE VALUE JUST WENT -- I'M SO EXCITED.
THERE YOU GO. RIGHT THROUGH THE ROOF.
Jimmy: IN ADDITION TO WRITING AND DIRECTING, YOU'RE ALSO A MUSICIAN NOW. THIS IS A NEW THING.
SORT OF, YEAH. I MEAN, I'M BARELY A MUSICIAN.
Jimmy: EXPLAIN THIS TO ME.
SO, YOU KNOW, LIKE -- I ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY GUITAR, ALWAYS HAD A GUITAR, TRIED TO TEACH MYSELF, COULD NEVER DO IT. I TELL MY WIFE THIS. AND THEN FOR MY 35th BIRTHDAY, A LONG TIME AGO, SHE GETS ME A A GUITAR AND LESSONS. AND I FULLY COMMIT TO IT. SO, THAT'S 12 YEARS AGO. SO I DECIDE EVERY DAY I'M GOING TO PRACTICE. AND A COUPLE YEARS LATER, I'M JAMMING WITH A BUDDY OF MINE FROM HIGH SCHOOL, AND THE GUY THAT DOES THE MUSIC FOR MY FILMS, AND WE KIND OF STUMBLE UPON A SONG. AND THIS GUY, P.T. WALKER WHO DOES THE MUSIC, IS LIKE, "HEY, I THINK THERE IS A PRETTY GOOD SONG HERE. LET'S FLESH IT OUT." SO HE COMES BACK TWO DAYS LATER. HE'S WRITTEN LYRICS FOR IT, AND WE PLAY IT. AND I'M LIKE, "LET'S JUST RECORD IT." I WAS DOING A MOVIE AT THE TIME. I SAID, "WE'LL RECORD IT, AND I'LL SNEAK IT INTO THE FILM ON TO THE SOUNDTRACK." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.
Jimmy: YEAH, "I'M ED BURNS. I WROTE, STARRED IN IT. I CAN ADD THIS. I THINK I CAN PULL SOME STRINGS, YEAH."
SO WE DO THAT AND WE COME UP WITH A NAME FOR THE BAND. OUR MASCOT FOR OUR HIGH SCHOOL WAS THE BLUE JACKETS. SO WE CALL THE BAND THE BLUE JACKETS. AND WE PUT IT ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
Jimmy: FANTASTIC.
YEAH. SO WE'RE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT. LET'S PLAY A COUPLE GIGS." SO YOU KNOW THE HAMPTONS, THERE'S PLACE CALLED THE TALKHOUSE OUT IN AMAGANSETT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO EVERY SUMMER WE WOULD PLAY THREE OR FOUR GIGS THERE. AND THAT WAS THE THING. SO WE'RE DOING THIS FOR A A COUPLE OF YEARS.
Jimmy: HERE'S WHERE IT GETS --
IT GETS A LITTLE WEIRD.
Jimmy: IT GETS FUN TO BE YOU, BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU. YOU PLAY THESE GIGS. YOU'RE IN THE HAMPTONS, YOU PLAY THESE BARS. AND THERE IS SOMEONE THAT COMES TO SEE YOU AT ONE OF THESE GIGS, JUST HAPPENS TO BE IN THE CROWD.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND THAT PERSON IS CHRIS MARTIN FROM COLDPLAY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: JUST THE WAY HIS LIFE IS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU WOULD NEVER SEE MY BAND IN A BAR.
Jimmy: BUT HERE'S WHERE IT GETS INSANELY AWESOME.
SO HE COMES TO MY 40th BIRTHDAY PARTY AND HE GOES, "LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO GET YOU, SO I WAS THINKING THIS. WE'RE DOING A FREE CONCERT AT THE GARDEN, AND DO YOU THINK THE BLUE JACKETS WOULD WANT TO OPEN FOR US?" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH.
Jimmy: SO YOU SAY NO. YOU SAY, "NO, I CAN'T MAKE IT THAT DAY." SO YOU OPEN -- YOU PLAYED IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN?
NO, SO THERE'S -- FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS, I BASICALLY -- I DON'T DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN -- I'M NOT -- YOU KNOW, I PLAY A A BAR BAND RHYTHM GUITAR. HE GIVES US 25 MINUTES, FIVE SONGS. SO THEN WE TURN INTO A REAL BAND. EVERY DAY WE'RE REHEARSING FOR THOSE FIVE SONGS.
Jimmy: OH, MY --
TALK ABOUT NERVOUS. NEVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I STILL HAVE THOSE MEMORIES OF, LIKE -- MIDDLE OF THE FIRST SONG LIKE HAVING TO TURN AROUND AND, LIKE, ADJUST MY AMP AND LITERALLY MY HAND IS SHAKING.
Jimmy: AND WHERE IS YOUR WIFE? CAN YOU SEE HER IN THE CROWD?
I CAN'T SEE HER, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. BECAUSE THE LIGHTS ARE ON STAGE --
Jimmy: NO, WE DON'T KNOW. NONE OF US HAVE PLAYED MADISON SQUARE GARDEN!
YOU HAVE!
WE DON'T PLAY MADISON SQUARE GARDEN! OH, MY GOSH.
I HAVE ONE MEMORY OF BEING ABLE TO LOOK AND JUST LIKE SEEING A SILHOUETTE OF PEOPLE LIKE WATCHING FROM THE -- WHATEVER YOU CALL THAT, THE HALLWAY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION. WHEN YOU'RE THE OPENING ACT FOR COLDPLAY, AND THERE WERE SOME FOLKS THAT WERE ACTUALLY LISTENING TO US.
Jimmy: YOU'RE ASSUMING EVERYONE IS JUST GOING TO THE BATHROOM, YEAH. "LET'S GET A COUPLE BEERS."
EVERYONE'S AT THE BAR GETTING LOADED UP. YOU KNOW. WHICH MAYBE HELPED --
Jimmy: THAT'S SUCH A GOOD MOVE. I LOVE THAT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SHOW. TNT. NOW, THIS IS A COP DRAMA BASED IN THE '60s ABOUT KIND OF -- YOUR DAD WAS A COP.
YES.
Jimmy: SO, DID YOU GROW UP WATCHING COP SHOWS ON TV?
I DID. AND, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE ALWAYS TOUGH TO WATCH WITH MY DAD, BECAUSE HE WAS BASICALLY SCREAMING AT THE TELEVISION THE WHOLE TIME. THAT'S NOT EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD GO. OR HE WOULD NEVER DO THAT OR HE WOULD NEVER DO THIS. SO IT WAS GREAT FOR HIM WHEN WRITING THESE SCRIPTS. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT TAKES PLACE IN THE '60s, HE REALLY HELPED ME WITH, LIKE, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY THE LANGUAGE OF THE TIME. OR THAT'S NOT HOW THE RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE BETWEEN THE CAPTAIN AND THE LIEUTENANT. THINGS LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. MY GRANDPA WAS A COP TOO, AND SAME THING. OH, NO, THAT'S NOT REAL.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: DID YOU LIKE "BARNEY MILLER" THOUGH?
I LOVED "BARNEY MILLER."
Jimmy: EVERYONE LOVED "BARNEY MILLER." [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ]
THE LOOK OF THE -- YEAH, IT WAS A GREAT SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT WAS A GREAT SHOW.
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY. WE LOOKED AT "BARNEY MILLER" JUST FOR THE PRODUCTION DESIGN OF THAT SQUAD ROOM. YOU KNOW, HE SAID THAT'S THE ONLY THING HE SAW THAT HAD THE RIGHT KIND OF GRIT AND CLUTTER AND ALL THAT.
Jimmy: ARE YOU WRITING ALL THESE?
YEAH, WE WROTE ALL TEN.
Jimmy: COME ON.
I MEAN, THIS IS A DREAM PROJECT. THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN DYING TO DO FOR 20 YEARS. I FINALLY GOT IT.
Jimmy: WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO SPIELBERG WHEN YOU WERE DOING "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN" AND YOUR DAD CAME TO THE SET AND YOU WERE TELLING COP STORIES, AND SPIELBERG'S LIKE, "THESE ARE GREAT STORIES."
HE HIRED ME THEN TO WRITE A A SCRIPT. A BIG SORT OF -- I KIND OF CALLED IT -- IT WAS LIKE AN IRISH-AMERICAN "GODFATHER" SET AGAINST THE COPS. AND COULDN'T GET THAT FILM MADE. BUT ALWAYS HELD ON TO THE IDEA OF A BIG -- YOU KNOW, FAMILY SAGA DRESSED UP AS A COP STORY. AND TWO SUMMERS AGO, I WAS -- I REIMAGINED IT FOR TELEVISION, AND, YOU KNOW, STEVEN STAYED A A A MENTOR IN MY LIFE, AND SAID, "HEY LOOK, I'VE GOT THIS PROJECT. I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER THE OLD ONE. TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEW VERSION OF THE SCRIPT." AND HE READ IT AND THANKFULLY FOR ME, HE SAID, YOU KNOW, "WHY DON'T I GET INVOLVED, EXECUTIVE PRODUCE?" AND WHEN YOU HAVE STEVEN IN YOUR CORNER, THE ANSWER TENDS TO BE YES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU, MAN. CONGRATS.
OH, THANK YOU, MAN.
Jimmy: I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT.
THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
