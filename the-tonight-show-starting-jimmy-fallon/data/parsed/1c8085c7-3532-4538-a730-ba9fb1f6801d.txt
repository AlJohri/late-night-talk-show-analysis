Jimmy: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
I TRIED TO GAMBLE A LITTLE, BUT I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE RULES.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T GAMBLE. THEY DON'T HAVE GAMBLING IN BRAZIL?
IT'S FORBIDDEN.
Jimmy: IT'S FORBIDDEN?
YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
IT IS.
Jimmy: SO, YOU DID THE MACARENA. [ LAUGHTER ] THE FORBIDDEN DANCE. YOU DID THE FORBIDDEN DANCE.
I DID A FORBIDDEN THING. IT DIDN'T WORK WELL FOR ME.
Jimmy: WHAT DID YOU DO?
THE EASIEST ONE WAS THE BLACKJACK, RIGHT? THE 21.
Jimmy: YEAH, I GUESS SO.
AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND --
I TRIED, AND MY FRIENDS, THEY HAD TO HELP ME OUT, BECAUSE I JUST COULDN'T. YOU HAVE THESE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO WITH YOUR HAND, LIKE THIS AND THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DON'T WAVE. NO ONE WAVES.
AND I WAS TRYING TO BE COOL.
Jimmy: LIKE DRIVING.
IT DIDN'T WORK REALLY WELL. THEY'RE LIKE, "DO THE THING."
Jimmy: WAVING. YEAH. YOU LOST MONEY.
I LOST 60 BUCKS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. IN AMERICA -- NO, NO, NO. IN AMERICA, THAT'S AN APPETIZER. IN AMERICA, THAT'S AN AMUSE-BOUCHE. THAT'S NOT EVEN GAMBLING THERE.
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO FURTHER.
Jimmy: YOU GO WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU WANT TO LOSE.
BUT I DID SOMETHING REALLY COOL THERE. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN -- I'M MARRIED, BUT I NEVER GOT MARRIED. I HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH MY WIFE FOR 15 YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WE HAVE THREE KIDS. AND WE NEVER GOT MARRIED LIKE PROPERLY.
Jimmy: OH.
SO I WAS LIKE, MAYBE THIS IS -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BAD IDEA. THIS IS A BAD IDEA. THIS IS AN AWFUL IDEA.
SO, I THOUGHT, THEY SAID IT'S KINDA COOL THERE, THE ELVIS PRESLEY THING -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PLEASE. OH, NO. I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR WIFE.
SO I PROPOSED.
Jimmy: YOU PROPOSED TO YOUR WIFE?
YEAH.
Jimmy: DID SHE SAY YES?
NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SHE SAID, "NO."
SHE SAID "NO." SHE SAID, "ARE YOU RIDICULOUS? DON'T "-- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE'RE NOT HAVING ELVIS MARRY US.
"WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?" YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, GOOD. ALL RIGHT. WELL AT LEAST YOU GOT IT OUT OF THE WAY. YOU PROPOSED AND SHE SAID "NO."
SHE SAID "NO."
Jimmy: SO THAT'S PERFECT. YEAH, SO AT LEAST YOU HAVE A A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. YOU HAVE IT FIGURED OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU DON'T WANNA GET MARRIED.
SHE SAID "NO," YEAH.
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY --
SHE REFUSED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU KNOW, IT HAPPENS. LOOK, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A A MATCH, AND SOMETIMES YOU'RE MARRIED FOR 15 YEARS AND NOT REALLY MARRIED. AND IT HAPPENS.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK, TOO.
Jimmy: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT "NARCOS," BECAUSE, CONGRATS ON THE GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATION.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA GET NOMINATED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S SO GREAT. YOU'RE SO GREAT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH YOU AS AN ACTOR, WHICH I SHOULD HAVE BEEN, BUT I -- WE DON'T GET BRAZILIAN CHANNELS IN THE UNITED STATES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IN MY HOUSEHOLD, BUT I WATCHED THIS THING, AND AS SOON AS I SAW YOU, I GO, "WHO IS THIS GUY?" YOU LOOKED UNBELIEVABLE. YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK SPANISH.
IT WAS THE CRAZIEST THING, BECAUSE THE FIRST IDEA WAS TO DO IT IN ENGLISH. AND I THOUGHT THAT I COULD SPEAK ENGLISH WITH AN ACCENT. I COULD DO THAT.
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU GET -- IT'S HARD, YEAH. YEAH, HOW DID THAT CAST YOU?
I THINK THIS IS THE MOST, I MEAN, THIS IS A BIG CASE OF MISCASTING.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT IS, YEAH.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST MISCASTINGS.
Jimmy: I TOTALLY DISAGREE. YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK SPANISH?
I WAS SUPER SKINNY. I MEAN, I WAS 40 POUNDS LIGHTER. AND I DIDN'T SPEAK A WORD OF SPANISH. SO WHEN THEY DECIDED TO DO IT, I WAS LIKE, "THESE GUYS ARE CRAZY."
Jimmy: YOU'RE PLAYING PABLO ESCOBAR. YOU HAVE TO LOOK LIKE THAT GUY. YOU CAN'T HAVE A NEW CHARACTER, "HI, I'M PABLO ESCOBAR, AND HOW'S IT GOING? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND YOU GOT ANY COCAINE? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S GOING ON?" LIKE, NO, HE'S A REAL PERSON.
WHAT I DID IS I FLEW MYSELF, EVEN BEFORE NET -- NETFLIX DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I WAS BEING CONSIDERED TO PLAY THE PART. BUT I FLEW MYSELF TO MEDELLIN, TO COLOMBIA IN ORDER TO LEARN SPANISH. AND I PUT MYSELF IN THE UNIVERSITY, IN A SPANISH COURSE FOR FOREIGNERS. SO I WAS IN A CLASS WITH JAPANESE TEENAGERS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW CRAZY IS THAT. HOW MUCH WEIGHT DID YOU GAIN?
40 POUNDS.
Jimmy: WOW.
WHICH IT'S LIKE BEING IN SCHOOL. LEARNING THINGS AND EATING DELICIOUS FOODS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAGNER MOURA, EVERYBODY. SEASON ONE OF "NARCOS" IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ON NETFLIX. ILIZA SHLESINGER PERFORMS STAND-UP FOR US NEXT. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIS IS MY THIRD TIME ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW." AND -- THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE, I TOLD YOU ALL THE LEGEND OF THE PARTY GOBLIN. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW, YOUR PARTY GOBLIN IS A A SMALL CREATURE THAT LIVES IN THE BACK OF YOUR BRAIN. AND SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE POOR DECISIONS YOU MAKE WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SHE'S THE ONE BACK THERE LIKE, EAT THAT SANDWICH OUT OF THE GARBAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] TEXT YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND THAT YOU LOVE HIM THEN TURN YOUR PHONE OFF. AND YOU KNOW IT'S YOUR PARTY GOBLIN THAT GOT YOU BY THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING. I DRANK SO MUCH THE OTHER NIGHT, I SLEPT FOR 15 HOURS. I SLEPT SO LONG, I ALMOST DIED. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, THERE WAS A POINT AT AROUND 2:00 P.M. WHERE MY SOUL WAS LIKE, SHOULD I JUST GO? [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU KNOW IT'S YOUR PARTY GOBLIN THAT GOT YOU WHEN YOU WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND THE FIRST THING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS, "OH, MY GOD. I'M SORRY." LIKE, THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I TALK A LOT ABOUT DRINKING. THAT'S BECAUSE MY GENERATION DRINKS A LOT. WE ARE A GENERATION OF DRINKERS BECAUSE WE ARE THE WORST. [ CHEERS ] YES. WE'RE THE MILLENNIALS. WE CHEER FOR OURSELVES. YES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GREAT. GOOD JOB, GUYS. WE'RE ENTITLED. WE'RE LAZY, RIGHT? I DON'T WANT TO BE AN INTERN. I JUST TO WANNA LIKE BLOG FROM A TOILET. [ LAUGHTER ] AND MAKE A LOT OF MONEY DOING IT. BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE INHERITED THIS SITUATION FROM OUR GRANDPARENTS. THEY STARTED THIS WAVE OF ENTITLEMENT. HERE'S A HISTORY LESSON. SO YOUR GRANDPARENTS HAD TO FIGHT IN A WAR. THEY HAD NO CHOICE. OKAY. THEY HAD NO CHOICE. IT'S NOT LIKE TODAY WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO BE DISENFRANCHISED. IN FACT, OUR COUNTRY DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB OF DEFENDING US, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WAR GOING ON RIGHT NOW, UNLIKE IT ON FACEBOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] GRANDPARENTS HAD NO CHOSE. THEY WERE DRAFTED. THEY WERE STRAIGHT UP DRIZAFTED. WHEN YOUR GRANDPA CAME HOME FROM CRACKING SKULLS IN OKINAWA, ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. ALL YOUR GRANDPA WANTED TO DO HAVE A LIFE, HAVE A FAMILY, BE LIKE A LITTLE RACIST, AND LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT LIKE -- THEY CAME HOME, THEY GOT -- THEY CAME HOME, THEY GOT RIGHT TO WORK. IT'S NOT LIKE US. NO ONE'S GRANDPA CAME HOME AND WAS LIKE, I JUST WANT TO BACKPACK AROUND OREGON AND FIND MYSELF. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO ONE'S GRANDMA CAME HOME FROM HELPING ON THE FRONT LINES AND WAS JUST LIKE, I JUST WANNA MAKE JEWELRY AND BE A MERMAID. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THAT WE LACK -- SNUCK UP ON ME. I THINK THAT WE LACK THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO FULLY APPRECIATE WHAT THEY CONTRIBUTED BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE OLD. RIGHT? AND WE LOOK AT THEM AND WE THINK THEY'RE CUTE. OH, MY GOD, CAUSE THEY'RE TINY, SHRINKING, EVER YEAR, PICK EM UP, PUT IT ON, THEY DON'T LIKE IT, RIGHT? AND THE WHITER YOU ARE, THE GREATER A CHANCE THERE IS THAT YOU'VE ASSIGNED LIKE A WEIRD KITTEN LIKE NICKNAME TO YOUR GRANDFATHER. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT JUST GRANDPA ANYMORE. IT'S LIKE THIS IS MY NIM-NAM. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS MY NIPPERS. THIS IS MY PIP-POP. OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS, DOUBLE TAP. HE'S SO CUTE. LOOK AT MY PIP-POP. AW. SOMETIMES AT CHRISTMAS WHEN PIP-POP FALLS ASLEEP, WE LIKE TO DECORATE HIM WITH CHRISTMAS BOWS. [ LAUGHTER ] SILLY PIP-POP. PIP-POP GOT 53 CONFIRMED KILLS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHOW SOME RESPECT TO PIP-POP. THAT WAS A STRONG GENERATION. OUR GENERATION IS NOT STRONG. AND WOMEN GET THE GARBAGE END OF THE STICK BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EVEN PHYSICALLY STRONG. WHICH IS THE ONLY STRENGTH THAT COUNTS WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENDING YOURSELF. WOMEN AREN'T EVEN PHYSICALLY STRONG. WE'RE ONLY PHYSICALLY STRONG WHEN IT COMES TO CHILD BIRTH. AND IT'S REALLY NOT USEFUL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. LIKE IT'S INSANE THE FACT I COULD, IF I CHOSE, PUSH A SMALL HUMAN BEING THROUGH MY VAGINA. [ LAUGHTER ] YET I LACK THE UPPER BODY STRENGTH TO EXECUTE 20 PROPER PUSH-UPS. THAT'S INSANE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WOMEN HAVE TO BE STRONG BECAUSE WE PUT UP WITH A LOT. IT'S HARD TO BE A GIRL. I HAVEN'T BEEN A GUY IN LIKE A A WHILE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT WE HAVE TO WITHSTAND A LOT OF CRITICISM. RIGHT? NO MATTER HOW SMART YOU ARE, OR ACCOMPLISHED AS A WOMAN, OUR LOOKS ARE ALWAYS THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION, OUR BODIES. I CAN ONLY THINK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS WHITE WOMAN, BUT BEING THIN HAS BEEN EXPECTED OF US FOR WAY TOO LONG. BEING GAUNT TO THE POINT OF EXTINCTION. BEING THE KIND OF THIN WHERE IT'S LIKE, WHAT UP, BITCHES, FIND ME, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S HARD. IT WASN'T UNTIL THE LAST 30 YEARS THAT WOMEN OF COLOR AND WOMEN OF OTHER ETHNICITIES ROSE TO PROMINENCE AND MADE IT SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE THE BODY OF A GROWN WOMAN. JENNIFER LOPEZ CAME ON TO THE SCENE WITH THE BACKSIDE OF A A BRONTOSAURUS. QUE PASO? [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] AND IT BECAME SEXY. WHITE WOMEN WE'LL TAKE IT. YOU CAN CRITICIZE US. BLACK WOMEN HAVE AN UNSHAKABLE SENSE OF SELF ESTEEM. THEY WANT -- YOU CAN TELL HER ANYTHING YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT HER, SHE WON'T BELIEVE YOU. WE'LL TAKE IT AS WHITE GIRLS. THEY'RE LIKE, I DON'T LIKE YOUR HAIR. HOW CAN I FIX IT CHAD? [ LAUGHTER ] PLEASE DON'T GET OUT OF THE KAYAK. TELL A SISTER THAT YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING ABOUT HER. FIRST OF ALL, I DARE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE WON'T BUY IT. BE LIKE, I DON'T LIKE YOUR JEANS. SHE'LL BE LIKE, BULL[ BLEEP ], I SEE YOU LOOKING. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU SO MUCH. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. ILIZA SHLESINGER RIGHT THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] COME ON. CATCH HER AT THE MOHEGAN SUN FEBRUARY 5th. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY. HIT A HOMERUN PAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
