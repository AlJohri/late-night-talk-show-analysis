Questlove: 152!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH! I FEEL IT, I FEEL THE LOVE! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS ] BEAUTIFUL. IT'S GONNA BE SO FUN TONIGHT, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, THIS IS BIG NEWS. THIS MORNING, APPLE'S CEO, TIM COOK, OFFICIALLY CAME OUT AS GAY. GOOD FOR HIM, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT KNOWING APPLE, A NEW TIM COOK WILL PROBABLY COME OUT NEXT WEEK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST MY LUCK. YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. APPLE'S CEO TIM COOK CAME OUT AS GAY, AND THEN THIS AFTERNOON THE CEO OF SAMSUNG CAME OUT AS BEING EVEN GAYER. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN THEY'RE ALWAYS COMPETING. ALWAYS COMPETING, AND IT'S NOT RIGHT.
Steve: IT'S NOT RIGHT.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT RIGHT IN THIS DAY AND AGE. YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT. THAT'S RIGHT. WHEN THEY HEARD THAT TIM COOK CAME OUT, APPLE WAS LIKE, "GUESS WE GOTTA GO BACK TO OUR OLD LOGO." AND IT'S JUST THE RAINBOW APPLE. IT JUST MAKES MORE SENSE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT MAKES SENSE. JUST DO IT. YOU ALREADY HAVE IT. GUYS, ELECTION DAY IS LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY, AND ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT ELECTION SEASON IS THE LOCAL CANDIDATES. I LOVE WATCHING THEM, I LOVE SEEING THEM. SOME OF THEM HAVE REALLY COLORFUL BACKGROUNDS. FOR INSTANCE, CHECK OUT THIS GUY RUNNING FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IN ARKANSAS.
ELECTION SEASON IN ARKANSAS HAS BROUGHT OUT AN ADMISSION THAT ONE OF THE CANDIDATES USED TO BE A STRIPPER. HIS NAME IS JOHN BURKHALTER, HE'S A DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. [ LAUGHTER ] HIS STRIPPER NAME WAS "THE METRO EXPRESS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT? WAIT, WHAT? CAN WE SEE THAT GUY AGAIN? THAT'S A STRIPPER? [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S METRO EXPRESS? IT'S MORE LIKE TRAGIC MIKE. [ LAUGHTER ] TRAGIC MIKE. HE'S A STRIPPER, THAT GUY.
Steve: TRAGIC MIKE.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, ALL OF THIS MAKES MORE SENSE WHEN YOU SEE ONE OF HIS CAMPAIGN ADS. CAN WE WATCH ONE OF HIS ADS?
CREATING JOBS IN ARKANSAS TAKES SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO CREATE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.
I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE BUILDING SMALL BUSINESSES IN ARKANSAS. BUSINESSES LIKE BOYS R US, STARBUTTS, RED THROBSTER, SACKS FIFTH AVENUE AND OF COURSE, BALLMART. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THE LAST ONE, I THINK WAL-MART HAS A LAWSUIT, I REALLY DO. HEY GUYS, HALLOWEEN IS TOMORROW. YOU KNOW THAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GET THIS, I SAW THAT A GROUP OF WINE EXPERTS -- WINE EXPERTS HAS ACTUALLY COME UP WITH A A LIST OF THE BEST WINES TO PAIR WITH HALLOWEEN CANDY. THEY SAID, WHITE WINE GOES GREAT WITH SKITTLES. RED WINE GOES GREAT WITH TWIX. AND -- WE'RE ALCOHOLICS, AREN'T WE? [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, YOU ARE. YOU HAVE A PROBLEM. ALSO, ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, GOOD-N-PLENTY IS THE MOST GOOGLED CANDY IN NEW YORK. USUALLY WITH THE WORDS "WHY ARE" BEFORE IT AND "AWFUL" AFTER IT. BUT STILL -- [ LAUGHTER ] I LIKE GOOD-N-PLENTY.
Steve: YEAH, I LOVE THEM.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE THEY? THEY'RE JUST LICORICE, RIGHT?
Steve: YEAH. IT'S LICORICE COATED SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT I GOOGLE. I GOOGLE IT EVERY DAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EVERY DAY?
Steve: EVERY SINGLE DAY I GOOGLE IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GOOD FOR YOU, MAN.
Steve: HEY, GOOGLE IT.
Jimmy: GOOD-N-PLENTY IS THE MOST GOOGLED CANDY IN NEW YORK. BUT WHAT'S MORE INTERESTING IS WHICH CANDIES ARE THE LEAST GOOGLED. HERE ARE THE LEAST POPULAR CANDIES. THERE'S BABY RUTH BADER GINSBERG. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HEY, DON'T JUDGE. DON'T JUDGE.
Jimmy: DON'T JUDGE, YEAH I KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT WE HAVE DEPRESSED RANCHERS. I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT AS GOOD AS JOLLY RANCHERS.
Steve: NO. NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD.
Jimmy: NO. ALSO THIS LEAST CANDY, LUKEWARM FISH TACOS IN A BAG. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THAT'S NOT EVEN -- NOT EVEN REALLY CANDY, REALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT EITHER WAY, NO ONE'S GOOGLING IT.
Steve: DON'T JUDGE.
Jimmy: NO ONE'S GOOGLING IT. AND FINALLY, THE LEAST GOOGLED, YORK PEPPERMINT PATE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHICH IS JUST -- IT'S JUST NOT GOOGLED. NOT ONE PERSON IS EVEN BINGING IT. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THOSE WEREN'T EVEN CANDIES.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DRESSING UP FOR HALLOWEEN, AND NOT ONLY THAT, A A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DRESSING UP THEIR PETS AS WELL. DO YOU GUYS DRESS UP YOUR PETS FOR HALLOWEEN? [ CHEERS ] PEOPLE DO IT. I THINK IT'S CUTE. SOMETIMES I'VE NOTICED THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE IN THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME, PETS AND THEIR OWNERS CAN BE THINKING TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, LOOK AT THESE GUYS. A MAN AND DOG WEARING BOTH WEARING SOMBREROS. I CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT THE MAN THAT HE'S THINKING, "WE'RE THE TWO AMIGOS." BUT THE DOG IS THINKING SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. THE DOG IS THINKING, "WHAT'S THE SPANISH WORD FOR 'KILL ME NOW?'" [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE, A WOMAN AND HER DOG ENJOYING A DAY IN THE PARK. I CAN TELL THE WOMAN IS THINKING, "MY FAVORITE PART ABOUT THIS COSTUME IS THE TWO LITTLE BALLS." [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T GET AHEAD OF ME. [ LAUGHTER ] THE DOG IS THINKING, "I REMEMBER WHEN I HAD THOSE." [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? IT'S JUST MEMORIES. [ APPLAUSE ] JUST BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES. HERE'S A WOMAN AND HER SUPER HERO DOG, THAT'S CUTE. SHE'S THINKING, "A DOG CAN BE A A WOMAN'S BEST FRIEND, TOO, HE-HE-HE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE DOG IS THINKING, "YOU REALLY NEED TO START DATING AGAIN, CHERYL. I MEAN, THIS IS GETTING SAD." [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S THE LAST ONE HERE. THIS IS A MAN AND HIS DOG DRESSED AS PIRATES. THE MAN IS THINKING, "COME ON, BUDDY, SAY, 'ARRRR.'" AND THE DOG IS THINKING, "[ BLEEP ] YOU, BRAD." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN SERIOUSLY -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DON'T MAKE ME DO -- DON'T DRESS ME UP AS A PIRATE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT HE WAS THINKING.
Steve: WHAT WAS HE THINKING?
Jimmy: WHEN I SAW THIS PHOTO THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT HE SAID. YOU GUYS, HERE'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE HEAD INTO THE HOLIDAYS. STUDIES SHOW THAT OBESITY RATES IN AMERICA HAVE BEEN ON THE RISE FOR YEARS NOW. AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S BEGINNING TO AFFECT MORE THAN JUST REAL HUMAN BEINGS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
STRAIGHT TO THE INDEX, AND THOSE ADULT CRASH TEST DUMMIES GETTING A MAKEOVER TONIGHT, GOING FROM 170 POUNDS TO 270. THEY SAY THE NEW DUMMIES ARE A A MORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE AVERAGE AMERICAN DRIVER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT CAR COMPANIES ARE MAKING CARS AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE. THE BAD NEWS IS THEY LITERALLY JUST CALLED US ALL FAT DUMMIES. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I GUESS IT'S GOOD. CAN WE SEE THAT DUMMY AGAIN? SOMETHING'S EVEN SADDER ABOUT THEM MAKING THE FAT DUMMY KEEP HIS SHIRT ON. IT'S A DUMMY. [ LAUGHTER ] AREN'T THE DUMMY'S FEELINGS GOING TO GET HURT? LET ME SEE THAT DUMMY AGAIN.
Steve: SAD.
Jimmy: IS THAT THE METRO EXPRESS? HEY, LADIES, HEY! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THE METRO EXPRESS. ♪♪

Jimmy: HAVE HIS MOM LEAVE. HE'S GOING TO BE VERY COLORFUL TONIGHT. SO, I'M WATCHING THE SHOW, IT'S THE SECOND SEASON OF IT ON BBC AMERICA, AND I LOVED IT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DID THROUGHOUT THE SEASON WAS YOU RAISED PIGS IN YOUR BACK YARD TO SHOW YOUR CHILDREN, WHO ARE SO CUTE, BY THE WAY, THE CUTEST LITTLE KIDS. YOU WANTED TO SHOW THEM WHERE BACON COMES FROM. WHERE DOES YOUR FOOD COME FROM.
I MEAN, IT'S A WAY OF TEACHING THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF FOOD. YOU CAN'T JUST WALK INTO A A SUPERMARKET AND IT'S ALL THERE. SO I BOUGHT THESE AMAZING BERKSHIRE PIGS, GORGEOUS.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND YOU SAID -- [ BRITISH ACCENT ] "NOW GUYS DON'T GET --" I'M GONNA DO AN IMPRESSION. IT'S NOT A GOOD ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ BRITISH ACCENT ] "DON'T GET ATTACHED TO THESE PIGS." THEY'RE NOT PETS.
NO.

THEY NAMED THEM. THEY MASSAGED THEM WITH OIL WHEN THE SUN CAME OUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY DID, THEY DID!
WE'RE LOOKING AFTER THEIR SKIN. SO, THINK OF THE CRISPY SORT OF CRACKLING. [ LAUGHTER ]

ARE YOU ALL VEGETARIANS?
Jimmy: YES! WE ALL ARE. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
Jimmy: JUST DON'T SAY IT. YOU WERE ALMOST --

Jimmy: YOU SHOULD SAY IT.
I WAS GOING TO TELL THEM TO [ BLEEP ] OFF. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I KNEW YOU WERE -- YOU CAN'T SAY THAT! [ CHEERS ]
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. HOWEVER, THE IDEA WAS TO GET THEM UP TO SPEED WITH NO WASTE. AND SORT OF LOVE THESE INGREDIENTS, BUT DON'T NAME THEM. THEN, YOU KNOW, THE DAY ARRIVES AND -- YOU KNOW, I GOT CAUGHT WITH ONE OF THE PIGS IN THE HOUSE AND TANA WENT CRAZY. 'CAUSE THE POOR THING [ BLEEP ] ALL OVER THE CARPET. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T SAY THAT, EITHER.
CRAPPED OVER THE CARPET.
Jimmy: NO, THE WORD CARPET YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOUR WIFE IS LIKE, "YOU GOT TO GET THE PIG OUT OF HERE."
I KNOW, I KNOW. SHE'S LIKE, "WHAT'S THAT SMELL?"
Jimmy: SHE'S GOT A PIG LIVING WITH HER.
TWO. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANTED TO FEED THEM A PROPER BREAKFAST AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY BEFORE THEY WENT TO THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE. AND HONESTLY, I GOT TO THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE, AND LITERALLY TWO MINUTES FROM THE DOOR I SAID TO THE GUY, "I SAID TURN AROUND, WE'RE TAKING THESE PIGS BACK." [ CHEERS ] I DID. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT DIDN'T [ BLEEP ] HAPPEN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: YOU WERE CRYING AND YOU WERE LIKE -- [ BRITISH ACCENT ] "I CAN'T DO THIS. I CAN'T DO THIS." AND YOU LEFT AND YOU COULDN'T WATCH -- I LOVED THE EMOTION. I COULD TELL THAT YOU HAVE A A BIG HEART.
I KNOW, I KNOW. I HAVE TO BE HONEST, 24 HOURS LATER, I HAD THE MOST AMAZING [ BLEEP ] SAUSAGES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO! AGAIN, THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF THE STORY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SORRY, SORRY, SORRY, SORRY. DELICIOUS SAUSAGES.
Jimmy: WE KNOW YOU AS A VERY SUCCESSFUL CHEF --
THIS IS "LATE NIGHT", RIGHT?
NO, THIS IS "THE TONIGHT SHOW" NOW. I GRADUATED.
OKAY. SORRY, SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DON'T DO THAT. WE'RE KEEPING IT CLASSY. [ LAUGHTER ] HAVE YOU EVER HAD A MEAL GONE TERRIBLY WRONG OR ARE YOU JUST ALWAYS AMAZING?
IF I DID, I'D NEVER SHOW IT ON CAMERA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU EDITED IT OUT, YEAH.
WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING IN PARIS --
Jimmy: YOU'VE NEVER [ BLEEP ] ON CAMERA? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SORRY. I HAD TO SAY IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING IN PARIS, I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS AMAZING FRENCH GIRL. AND I HAD THIS LITTLE STUDIO FLAT. AND THIS IS THE BIG MOMENT WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND I COULD COOK FOR HER. I COULDN'T AFFORD TO TAKE IT OUT FOR DINNER.
Jimmy: WERE YOU A A PROFESSIONAL CHEF AT THE TIME?
YEAH, 22, LITERALLY NOTHING. NOT EVEN A POT TO PISS IN. JUST THIS LITTLE STUDIO FLAT AND I THOUGHT I'D HAVE A A ROMANTIC DINNER. SO, STARTED OFF WITH SOME OYSTERS, WHITE TRUFFLE RISOTTO. AND YOU KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE WHITE TRUFFLES ARE. SO I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOT REALLY. I MEAN YEAH, I GUESS. DO I LOOK LIKE I EAT WHITE TRUFFLES? I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, BUT FROM A CHEF'S POINT OF VIEW THEY'RE REALLY LIKE MEGA, MEGA EXPENSIVE.
Jimmy: YEAH, HOW DID YOU GET --
SO I BEGGED THE CHEFS.
Jimmy: OH, FROM THE RESTAURANT. YOU STOLE IT FROM THE RESTAURANT.
WELL NO. QUITE INTERESTING BUT -- CAN YOU STOP DROPPING ME IN THE [ BLEEP ]?

SO, ANYWAY, I'M PREPARING THIS AMAZING DINNER.
Jimmy: YEAH, GREAT, ROMANTIC.
CANDLES, BEAUTIFUL, FILET MIGNON FOR THE MAIN COURSE. WHITE TRUFFLE RISOTTO, CHOCOLATE FONDANT FOR DESSERT. I START OFF WITH OYSTERS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU CLOSE, YOU DON'T CHEW AN OYSTER. YOU SWALLOW. LLL SO I SAID, CLOSE YOUR EYES, OPEN YOUR MOUTH, AND I'LL PUT THIS LITTLE OYSTER IN THERE. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A BIT OF AN APHRODISIAC, RIGHT?
APHRODISIAC, OYSTERS. ABSOLUTELY. SMART, GOOD MAN.
I WAS LEARNING FRENCH AT THE TIME.
Jimmy: OOH, LA-LA.
SO HER MOUTH WAS LIKE -- AND SHE'S LIKE -- [ SPEAKING FRENCH ] I WAS LIKE, SWALLOW IT. ANYWAY, SHE SWALLOWED IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I SWEAR TO GOD, 30 SECONDS LATER, HER NECK STARTED SWELLING. HE EARS STARTED GOING RED. AND HE NOSE WENT BRIGHT RED. SHE HAD AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO OYSTERS. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] HOLD ON, IT GETS WORSE.
Jimmy: NO.
TWO MINUTES LATER, I'M TRYING TO DIAL FOR THE AMBULANCE. I'M NOW CRAPPING MYSELF.
Jimm: SHE CAN'T --
SHE JUMPS UP, RUNS OVER TO THE WINDOW AND VOMITS ALL OVER MY APARTMENT.
Jimmy: MY GOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, IT GETS WORSE. NO, SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE SHE WAS VOMITING ON MY WHITE TRUFFLES. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT WHY. THAT'S NOT WHY YOU WERE UPSET. IF THAT'S THE WORST DATE EVER -- DID YOU GO BACK ON ANOTHER DATE WITH HER?
I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN.
Jimmy: NEVER SAW HER AGAIN. THAT MAKES SENSE. CONGRATS ON "MASTER CHEF", OF COURSE, WE LOVE THAT. I LOVE EVERYTHING YOU DO, IT'S ALWAYS FUN. BUT "MASTER CHEF, JR." IS FUN. I LOVE IT. IT'S KIDS. AND HOW OLD ARE THE KID?
8 TO 13 YEARS OLD, I MEAN, INCREDIBLE. TALENTED, GIFTED. BUT SOME OF THEM WANT TO PLAY BASEBALL, SOCCER, FOOTBALL --
Jimmy: YEAH.
THESE KIDS WANT TO COOK. THEY WANT TO COOK FOR PASSION, EXCITEMENT. I THINK IT'S A GREAT LIFE SKILL, KNOWING HOW TO COOK.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. AND THE PARENTS ARE THERE, TOO.
OH, THEY'RE A NIGHTMARE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY'RE LIKE STAGE MOMS AND DADS?
IT'S TERRIBLE.
Jimmy: REALLY, YEAH.
THERE'S A SHOW RIGHT THERE.
Jimmy: STAGE MOMS FOR THE KIDS. BUT THEY'RE THERE, AND IT'S A A GOOD LESSON FOR PARENTS. BECAUSE, YOU GET TO GO "YOUR KIDS CAN ACTUALLY MAKE SOME GOOD STUFF."
IT'S FASCINATING WATCHING THE SORT OF TRANSITION. ESPECIALLY IN SEASON TWO. GETTING THESE KIDS TO ACTUALLY EDUCATE THE PARENTS ON WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.
Jimmy: WHAT DO THEY WIN WHEN THEY WIN "MASTER CHEF, JR."?
SO WE SET UP A SCHOLARSHIP FOR WHEN THEY FINISH COLLEGE. A THREE-YEAR APPRENTICESHIP SCHEME AND A SMALL CHECK FOR ONE HUNDRED GRAND.
