Jimmy: OH YEAH. NO, NO, NO. YOU DON'T MESS AROUND. THAT GUY -- [ CHEERS ] EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES, I GO -- YEAH, HE IS THE BEST AT IT.
AND WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT HIM IS HE TAKES SCI-FI BUT HE ADDS HEART INTO IT, YOU KNOW, LIKE "ET" AND "A.I." HE BRINGS THE EMOTION AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CHARACTERS INTO THE WORLD OF SCI-FI. WHICH I THINK IS HIS SIGNATURE.
Jimmy: AND IT'S A COOL -- THE PREMISE IS AMAZING. WE'LL GET TO THE PREMISE. BUT IT'S ALSO SHOT BEAUTIFULLY, AND IT LOOKS ALMOST LIKE -- IT LOOKS LIKE A MOVIE.

Jimmy: I'LL -- I'LL MAKE LOVE TO YOU!
I WILL TOO!
Jimmy: YEAH, GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE -- LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS AN ACTUAL BOOK. YOU WRITE THESE -- THIS IS A REAL BOOK.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S NOT LIKE A A CELEBRITY BOOK THAT'S, LIKE, NOT A REAL BOOK.
YEAH, NO! AND I WRITE EVERY BOOK MYSELF. I WRITE EVERY WORD.
Jimmy: WELL, YOU MUST HAVE TIME SINCE YOU BEEN FIRED FROM "GLEE."
RIGHT, RIGHT. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] I WOULD HAVE SOME TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH. WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT? WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?
WELL, MY TWITTER GOT HACKED, AND IT SUCKED!
Jimmy: HOW WOULD THAT HAPPEN? THEY FOUND OUT YOUR PASSWORD OR SOMETHING?
NO! I THINK IT WAS LIKE A HACKER OR SOME KIND OF, LIKE, SOFTWARE PROGRAM. THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
Jimmy: YEAH, GOOD, AND -- WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU FOUND OUT? WHAT DID THEY SAY EXACTLY?
WELL, I WAS ON A PLANE COMING BACK FROM LONDON AND -- WITH NO WIFI, SO IT DEFINITELY WASN'T ME. AND AS SOON AS THE PLANE LANDED, MY CELL PHONE JUST EXPLODED. AND I GOT TEXTS FROM -- WELL, WHO I CALL, LOVINGLY, THE AMBULANCE BRIGADE.
Jimmy: THE AMBULANCE BRIGADE?
THEY'RE FIVE PEOPLE WHO ONLY MESSAGE ME WHEN THERE'S -- WHEN SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW THOSE PEOPLE.
SO WHENEVER I KNOW -- WHENEVER I SEE MESSAGES FROM ALL FIVE OF THEM, I KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG.
Jimmy: YEAH, SOMETHING HAPPENED.
SO I GOT THE HEADS UP FROM THE AMBULANCE BRIGADE. AND THEN, I FIGURED OUT MY TWITTER HAD BEEN HACKED.
Jimmy: AND WHAT DID THE TWITTER THING -- WHAT DID THE TWEET SAY?
IT SAID SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF I HAD BEEN FIRED FROM "GLEE" AND AN EXPLANATION WOULD COME LATER.
Jimmy: WOW! EVERYONE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THAT.
IT COULDN'T EVEN BE SOMETHING COOL. LIKE, LIKE, LIKE -- YOU KNOW, I GREW A THIRD ARM OR I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THAT WOULD'VE BEEN KIND OF FUN, IF YOU DID THAT. BUT IT WASN'T THAT AT ALL.
NO, NO. YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH BUT -- SO YOU'RE STILL ON "GLEE"?
I'M STILL ON "GLEE."
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE STILL ON "GLEE." GOOD, WE LOVE THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE LOVE THE SHOW. WE LOVE YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES.
Jimmy: YOU WERE TELLING ME BACKSTAG BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOU, MAYBE, BECA
UH-HUH.
Jimmy: WHEN -- SOMETIM SLEEP, AND YOU D Y YOU SLEEP SHOP.
I HAVE CRAZY SLEEPING HABITS. EVER SINCE I WAS A KID, I'VE ALWAYS HAD THESE CRAZY SLEEP ISSUES. SO WHEN I LANDED AND SAW IT, I WAS LIKE, "OH, CRAP! WAS IT ME? DID I DO IT WHILE I WAS ASLEEP ON THE PLANE?" BUT THERE WAS NO WIFI, SO IT DEFINITELY WASN'T ME.
Jimmy: NO TRUTH TO THAT AT ALL. BUT YOU SAID TO ME EARLIER THAT YOU SLEEP SHOP. AND I JUST NODDED. AND I SAID, "YEAH," AND I WALKED AWAY. AND THEN I GO, "WHAT THE HELL WAS HE TALKING ABOUT?" [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, SLEEP SHOP?
WELL, IT MEANS -- I USED TO TAKE THIS PILL TO HELP ME SLEEP. AND THEN, I GUESS WHEN I WAS ASLEEP, I'D TAKE OUT MY iPAD AND I'D JUST START SHOPPING. AND THESE PACKAGES KEPT SHOWING UP AT MY HOUSE. AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD! IDENTITY FRAUD OR SOMETHING." BUT THEN I'D LOOK UP THE HISTORY IN MY iPAD. "OH, NOPE. I BOUGHT THIS." AND THE THINGS THAT I WOULD GET WERE JUST CRAZY. LIKE, I GOT LIKE A FULL MARIE ANTOINETTE PORTRAIT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW WOULD YOU EVEN FIND THAT?
I -- IT CAME! I DID! IT'S --
Jimmy: MARIE ANTOINETTE PORTRAIT.
YEAH, IT'S IN MY BATHROOM. IT'S A GREAT CONVERSATION PIECE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, LIKE, CORKSCREWS THAT WERE SHAPED SUGGESTIVELY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT IS GOING ON? HOW WOULD YOU --
I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: -- FIND THAT? WAIT. IT WAS LIKE DIRTY CORKSCREWS AND A MARIE ANTOINETTE?
YEAH, IT WAS -- I MEAN, THEY KIND OF WORK TOGETHER.
Jimmy: BUT IT'S KIND OF FUN, I GUESS. BECAUSE THEN YOU -- IT ALMOST LIKE CHRISTMAS.
IT IS, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU GO, "WHAT IS THIS PRESENT?" AND WHEN YOU OPEN IT UP AND YOU GO, "I ALWAYS WANTED THIS." [ LAUGHTER ] A FILTHY CORKSCREW. THIS IS FANTASTIC! NOW, YOU'RE ON A BOOK SIGNING TOUR NOW. CONGRATULATIONS ON THESE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY. THIS IS THE THIRD IN THE SERIES.
THIRD IN THE SERIES. YES.
Jimmy: THAT'S JUST AMAZING. AND SO YOU'RE GOING UP AND YOU SIGN BOOKS ALL DAY LONG, RIGHT?
YES.
Jimmy: IT'S A LONG DEAL.
YEAH, IT'S LONG. I HAVE 12 CITIES.
Jimmy: 12 CITIES? GOOD FOR YOU. AND THEN, YOU ACTUALLY WENT TO A BOOK SIGNING RECENTLY BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO MEET HILLARY CLINTON.
YES! I TRIED -- BECAUSE I KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT WORK AT "THE GROVE" IN LOS ANGELES BECAUSE I DO MY SIGNINGS THERE. SO I CALLED THEM AND I SAID, "COULD YOU SNEAK ME IN SO I COULD MEET HILLARY CLINTON?" BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WHY NOT?
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND LITTLE DID I KNOW THERE WOULD BE SO MUCH PRESS THERE. AND IT LITERALLY MADE EVERY SINGLE HOME PAGE OF EVERY WEBSITE EVER. IT WAS CRAZY.
Jimmy: WHAT WERE THEY SAYING?
WELL, SHE HAD, LIKE, THIS FACE WHEN WE MET. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAD THE PICTURE.
Jimmy: I DO HAVE IT, AND I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS. WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER TO FRIGHTEN HER? [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW. SHE'S FRIGHTENED.
YEAH.
Jimmy: SHE'S -- WHAT DID YOU SHOCK HER WITH?
WELL, APPARENTLY, SHE'S A A HUGE --
Jimmy: WERE YOU DESCRIBING A A CORKSCREW OR SOMETHING? [ LAUGHTER ]
I WAS TRYING TO GET HER TO SAY "I'LL MAKE LOVE TO YOU." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SHE WAS LIKE, "NO! I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT!"
YEAH. NO, SHE WAS BEING VERY POLITE. BUT EVERYONE MADE IT OUT TO BE THAT SHE WAS THIS HUGE "GLEE" FAN, WHICH -- I DON'T THINK HILLARY CLINTON'S A "GLEE" FAN.
Jimmy: NO, NO. SO SHE WAS ALMOST LIKE -- MAYBE SHE WAS LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW YOU."
MAYBE, MAYBE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, SHE CLEARLY KNOWS YOU BECAUSE THERE'S THE PROFESSIONAL, HAPPY --
YEAH, SHE'S VERY NICE.
Jimmy: AW. MUCH HAPPIER THERE. THAT'S GOOD. [ APPLAUSE ]
YEAH, GOOD. MY FAMILY'S MAD AT ME, THOUGH.
Jimmy: YOUR FAMILY --
MY FAMILY IS VERY CONSERVATIVE, SO THEY'RE UPSET THAT I WENT. AND GRANDMA DOESN'T KNOW.
Jimmy: OH. GRANDMA? OH, WELL IT'S TOO LATE TO TELL -- GRANDMA, LOWER -- LOWER THE VOLUME. GRANDMA, CHANGE THE CHANNEL. DUDE, CONGRATS ON THESE BOOKS, AND CONGRATS ON EVERYTHING. AND I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE STILL ON "GLEE."
