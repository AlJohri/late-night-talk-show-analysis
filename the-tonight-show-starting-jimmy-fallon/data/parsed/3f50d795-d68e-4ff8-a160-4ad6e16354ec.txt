Jimmy: OH, BEAUTIFUL. HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE PART OF THE SHOW. I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. CHECK THIS OUT. THE "NEW YORK TIMES" MAGAZINE JUST DID A BIG PROFILE ON DONALD TRUMP, WHO SOME SAY IS STILL THE FRONTRUNNER FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. AND GET THIS, IT TURNS OUT HE USUALLY GETS ONLY FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP A NIGHT. YEAH. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY TODAY, HE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND SAID, "YOU'RE TIRED." [ LAUGHTER ] "YOU STILL LOOK FANTASTIC." [ LAUGHTER ] THE STORY SAYS THAT DONALD TRUMP GETS SO LITTLE SLEEP, HE ACTUALLY SUFFERS FROM SLEEP DEPRIVATION. THEN AGAIN, SO DO MOST PEOPLE WHO THINK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP BECOMING PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: OH! HEY! HEY, OH. OH!
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, THOUGH, IF YOU WATCH SOME OF TRUMP'S RECENT INTERVIEWS, YOU CAN TELL THAT HE HASN'T BEEN GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP. WATCH THIS CLIP FROM "60 MINUTES" AND SEE IF YOU NOTICE ANYTHING.
WHAT'S YOUR TAX PLAN?
A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION FOR THE MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE.
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON? [ SNORING ] [ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T LIKE LIES.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, DID YOU SEE THAT? [ APPLAUSE ] DO YOU -- IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY -- BUT TRUMP'S LEAD DOES SEEM TO BE SLIPPING.

[ LAUGHTER ] [ TRUMP IMPRESSION ] "SHE'S LOWER THAN HEIDI KLUM." MEANWHILE, A LOT OF RAND PAUL SUPPORTERS ARE WORRIED THAT HE'S ABOUT TO DROP OUT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE, BECAUSE HE'S ALSO STARTED RAISING MONEY TO RUN FOR THE SENATE AS WELL. I GOTTA SAY, HIS NEW CAMPAIGN ISN'T VERY CONVINCING. CHECK THIS OUT.
RAND PAUL IS ALL IN TO BE YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
WE'RE IN IT TO WIN IT.
UNLESS HE DOESN'T WIN IT. IN WHICH CASE, HE'S ALL IN TO BE YOUR NEXT SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY, OF THE UNITED STATES. JOIN OUR FIGHT TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY -- OR STATE -- RESPECTABLE AGAIN.
WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED --
WITH ONE OF THESE CAMPAIGNS.
BY NO MEANS AM I FINISHED --
DECIDING WHICH ONE IT'S GOING TO BE. RAND PAUL FOR AMERICA. OR KENTUCKY.
WE'RE IN FOR THE LONG HAUL --
UNLESS WE'RE NOT. RAND PAUL FOR PRESIDENT. OR SENATOR OR WHATEVER. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC. GOOD LUCK -- GOOD LUCK TO HIM OR WHATEVER. OR WHATEVER HE WANTS. AND I SAW THAT CNN HAS INVITED ALL FIVE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES TO BE -- TO ITS FIRST DEBATE NEXT MONTH IN LAS VEGAS. THAT'S RIGHT. THEY ACTUALLY SENT OUT INVITATIONS TO THE CANDIDATES. CHECK OUT THE RSVPs THEY GOT IN RETURN. FOR INSTANCE, HERE'S HILLARY CLINTON'S RSVP. SHE WROTE, "I THINK IT WILL BE REALLY CUTE TO SEE WHAT THE OTHER CANDIDATES SAY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT, BERNIE SANDERS'S RSVP. HE WROTE, "I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION WITH MY COMPETITORS, SO PLEASE ACCEPT MY RSV --" THEN HILLARY INTERRUPTED. [ LAUGHTER ] HILLARY INTERRUPTED HIM AND WROTE, "JUST MAKING SURE YOU KNOW I'LL BE THERE. I THINK I MAY HAVE DELETED THAT OTHER RSVP BY MISTAKE. AND LOOK, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT RSVP HAPPENED TO IT." [ APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, HERE'S DONALD TRUMP'S RSVP. HE WROTE, "WASN'T INVITED, BUT I'M COMING ANYWAY. YOU CAN THANK ME LATER, CNN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GOING TO GET GOOD RATINGS. GOING TO BE HUGE. THIS IS BIG. NSA LEAKER EDWARD SNOWDEN JOINED TWITTER YESTERDAY AND HE IMMEDIATELY GOT MORE FOLLOWERS THAN THE NSA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH RAISES AN INTERESTING QUESTION, WHO IS FOLLOWING NSA ON TWITTER? [ LAUGHTER ] NERDS? I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU GUYS FELL FOR THIS, BUT APPARENTLY THERE'S BEEN SOME HOAXES GOING AROUND FACEBOOK LATELY THAT SAY YOU MAY NEED TO PAY MONEY IN ORDER TO KEEP YOUR STATUSES PRIVATE.

NO, HE DID. I GUESS RICK GOT A LITTLE ROUGH WITH HIM, HE PULLED HIS EAR.
Jimmy: WHAT?
AND HE DOESN'T LIKE TO GET HIS EAR, AND HE, IT WAS TERRIBLE. AND I WAS DOING SOMETHING ELSE WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND I WENT BACK IN MY OFFICE. I TOOK A PICTURE OF IT, ACTUALLY. HE'S IN THIS SHAME SPIRAL AFTER BITING RICK.
Jimmy: OH YEAH, I THINK YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING.
OH YEAH, THAT'S THE, I JUST BIT RICK SPRINGFIELD. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Jimmy: HE BIT RICK SPRINGFIELD.
I AM SO ASHAMED. YES. I WISH THAT I WAS JESSIE'S GIRL.

I WAS HAVING A BAD DAY. BY THE WAY, I'M NEVER IN A BAD MOOD. I'M A VERY POSITIVE GUY.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
KIND OF LIKE YOU, ACTUALLY.
Jimmy: IT'S ALL FAKE.
YEAH, RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS HAVING A BAD DAY. I HAD TEA BREATH.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT MADE ME LAUGH. THAT'S WHAT MADE ME LAUGH AND MADE ME CALL IN. BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU HAD TEA BREATH.
I DID.
Jimmy: I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHEN YOU DRINK THAT TEA AND GET THE TEA BREATH, IT'S WEIRD. WHAT DO YOU DO TO TAKE OUT THE TEA BREATH? WHAT'S YOUR GO-TO MINT?
I JUST DISCOVERED THOSE MINI TOOTH BRUSHES THAT HAVE THE LITTLE PEARL OF TOOTHPASTE ON THEM. THEY'RE AMAZING, CHECK IT OUT. I'M OBSESSED.
Jimmy: I DON'T ANYTHING ABOUT THAT AT ALL.
THERE WERE SOME IN MY DRESSING ROOM. SO, GO IN YOUR OWN DRESSING ROOM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T GET DRESSED HERE. I GET DRESSED AT HOME. BUT YOU -- [ LAUGHTER ]

NO, BUT THEY'RE THESE LITTLE MINIS, YOU CAN BRING THEM EVERYWHERE.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YES.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD.
SO IT SAID ON THE MONITOR, THERE'S A LIST OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE PHONE AND WHAT THEIR QUESTIONS ARE. IT SAID, "JIMMY FALLON," AND THEN IN CAPS, "IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE HIM." [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT WAS YOU. SO AWESOME.
Jimmy: YEAH, I HAD TO CALL BECAUSE I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE AIR FOR TWO WEEKS NOW, RIGHT?
YES, "RADIO ANDY" HAS BEEN ON FOR TWO WEEKS.
Jimmy: I MEAN THIS IS SO EXCITING. "RADIO ANDY," YOU KIND OF CORNERED THE MARKED ON THE NAME ANDY.
LET'S SEE. ANDY GIBB IS NO LONGER WITH US.

I KNOW, I'M KIND OF SCARED. YOU KNOW, BRAVO LETS ME IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE ON CABLE EVERY NIGHT AT 11:00, AND I'M ALWAYS SCARED, OH, NO, WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY? AND I HAVE ALCOHOL, WHICH IS DOUBLE TROUBLE. IN FRONT OF A MICROPHONE ON SIRIUS WHERE I CAN SAY BAD WORDS AND THE MIC IS LIVE, I'M SCARED I'M GOING TO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
Jimmy: YOU NEVER OFFENDED ANYONE. HAS ANYONE EVER BEEN --
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, SOMETHING HAPPENED RECENTLY WHERE I -- DID YOU HEAR THE STORY OF TORI SPELLING GETTING BURNED AT BENIHANA? IT'S ACTUALLY NOT FUNNY. BUT I MADE A JOKE ABOUT IT. I MADE LIKE A CHICKEN CACCIATORE JOKE ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT GOOD. AND I LOVE --

Jimmy: OH, MADONNA, OF COURSE.
SHE E-MAILED ME AND SHE GOES, "DUDE, JUST SO YOU KNOW. I REALLY LIKE YOU. YOU SEEM LIKE A GREAT GUY, BUT THIS IS NOT FUNNY AND YOU KIND OF MADE FUN OF ME AND I FEEL BAD." AND WENT INTO A VERY LONG E-MAIL ABOUT HOW SERIOUS IT WAS AND ALL THIS STUFF. I E-MAILED HER BACK AND SAID I'M SO SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO. I'M SORRY I TOLD ALL THOSE JOKES. IT'S ALL GOOD. AT THE BOTTOM, I SAID, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT SAID IN THE E-MAIL THAT SHE HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO EAT FOR A WEEK AFTER THE BURN. I SAID, AND ALSO, "EAT SOMETHING" IN ALL CAPS. SHE E-MAILED ME BACK, "NOW YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF MY APPEARANCE?" AND THEN I WENT BACK AND READ THE E-MAIL, AND SHE HADN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO EAT. I MADE IT UP. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS TERRIBLE. SO THEN I E-MAILED HER BACK. AND I FELT SO BAD.
Jimmy: EAT SOMETHING, YEAH.
AND I'M CO-DEPENDENT AND I DON'T LIKE TO HURT ANYBODY'S FEELINGS. AND I GO, "I'M SO SORRY. I MISREAD THE E-MAIL." IT WAS TERRIBLE.
Jimmy: TORI, IF YOU'RE WATCHING.
