Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS. THAT'S A HOT CROWD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I FEEL -- I FEEL THE LOVE! I FEEL THE LOVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW" EVERYBODY! WE'RE HERE. HERE WE ARE. IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG SHOW TONIGHT. VERY EXCITING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] VERY EXCITING. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. YESTERDAY THE WHITE HOUSE CONFIRMED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL MEET WITH POPE FRANCIS DURING HIS VISIT IN SEPTEMBER. SOME EXPERTS ARE WONDERING IF THEY'LL DISCUSS THEIR DISAGREEMENT OVER CONTRACEPTION. THEN JOE BIDEN WAS LIKE, "I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY WERE DATING." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT WILL MEET WITH POPE FRANCIS AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN SEPTEMBER. THE TWO WILL MEET FOR ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO, THEN THE POPE WILL SPEND THE REST OF THE DAY HEARING CONFESSIONS FROM SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] MAKES SENSE. SPEAKING OF -- YEAH. IT'S STRANGE OVER THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF THE SECRET SERVICE, THEY'RE STILL DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT FROM THAT REPORTED CRASH OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU KNOW THAT CRASH -- THEIR DIRECTOR, JOSEPH CLANCY, SAID THE AGENCY WILL NOW STORE ITS VIDEO FOOTAGE FOR A WEEK AFTER HE REVEALED THAT NORMALLY THEY GET DELETED AFTER 72 HOURS. [ LAUGHTER ] SERIOUSLY? HE SOUNDS LESS LIKE THE HEAD OF SECRET SERVICE, MORE LIKE A A DELI OWNER ON "LAW & ORDER." [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE STILL GOT THE TAPES. WE REUSE THEM EVERY OTHER DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE WELCOME TO TAKE A LOOK. BUT I GOT CUSTOMERS. [ SOUND EFFECT ] [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TAKE A LOOK. NUMBER 23, YOUR SALAMI'S READY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GUYS HEAR THIS? REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TED CRUZ SAID RECENTLY THAT HE PLANS TO ATTRACT YOUNG VOTERS WITH HIS HUMOR AND JOKES. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S INTERESTING. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF THOSE JOKES.
A MAN WAS STOPPED AFTER HE CLIMBED THE FENCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. YEAH, THE SECRET SERVICE STOPPED HIM. THEY SAID, "I'M SORRY, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE TWO MORE YEARS LEFT ON YOUR TERM." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT ONE ACTUALLY CAME FROM JIMMY FALLON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY OH! HEY OH, OH HEY! FORGET ABOUT IT!
Jimmy: SHOULD I BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ] A GOOD JOKE, THOUGH. THIS WEEK ANOTHER POTENTIAL CANDIDATE, RAND PAUL, SAID THAT HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN BEAT HILLARY CLINTON IN CERTAIN SWING STATES. HILLARY WAS LIKE, "THAT'S RIDICULOUS." WHILE BILL WAS LIKE, "DID SOMEBODY SAY SWING?" [ LAUGHTER ] NO, BILL, NO. PRETTY AMAZING. RESEARCHERS AT GOOGLE ARE SAYING THAT ITS RECOGNITION SOFTWARE, FACENET, CAN IDENTIFY ONE PERSON OUT OF 260 MILLION PEOPLE WITH 86% ACCURACY. YEAH. WELL I KNOW WITH 100% ACCURACY THAT FACENET IS STILL WHAT MY MOM CALLS FACEBOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] I SENT YOU A MESSAGE ON FACENET. OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. NO, YOU DIDN'T. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS PRETTY COOL. I SAW THAT OPRAH IS AUCTIONING OFF OVER $1 MILLION WORTH OF HER BELONGINGS FROM HER CHICAGO APARTMENT. OR AS SHE CALLS THEM, HER LEAST FAVORITE THINGS. HERE'S A USED SHAKE WEIGHT!

Steve: YEAH, PORTLY THUG. THEN HE LOST WEIGHT.
Jimmy: HE LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT. SO SLIM THUG, HE WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES" THIS WEEK ABOUT WHY HAVING SEX WITH YOUR REAL ESTATE AGENT IS A BAD IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ] HIS REAL ESTATE AGENT WAS LIKE, "NOT AS BAD AN IDEA AS HAVING SEX WITH SLIM THUG." I HAVE TO WORK IN THIS TOWN, PAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS. MIND YOUR BISCUITS! CHECK THIS OUT. WILLIE NELSON IS APPARENTLY DEVELOPING HIS OWN BRAND OF WEED AND BONGS. [ CHEERS ] WHICH I GUESS IS SORT OF LIKE HIS VERSION OF OPRAH'S GARAGE SALE. I GOT A BUNCH IN THE WAREHOUSE. I'M NOT USING THESE. YOU CAN SMOKE IT. THAT'S RIGHT. WILLIE NELSON IS DEVELOPING HIS OWN BRAND OF WEED CALLED "WILLIE'S RESERVE." HE'S ACTUALLY NOT THE FIRST CELEBRITY TO DO THIS. IN FACT, A LOT OF FAMOUS PEOPLE HAVE RELEASED THEIR OWN STRAINS OF MARIJUANA. SOME OF THEM ARE PRETTY SURPRISING. TAKE A LOOK. FIRST WE HAVE BARACK OBAMA. HE RELEASED "YES, WE CANNABIS." [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT, NEW YORK MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO. HE RELEASED "SUBWAY TOKIN'." [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. AFTER THAT WE HAVE JOHN BOEHNER. HE RELEASED "JOINT SESSION." [ LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, THERE'S MICHAEL JORDAN. HE RELEASED "AIR BUD." WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY.

I'M LIKE, "THAT'S YAUCH. THAT'S YAUCH, MAN. OH, MY GOSH. I'VE GOT TO GO TALK TO HIM. I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING TO HIM." I HAD A CYPRESS HILL SHIRT ON. AND I HAD ABOUT -- REMEMBER THE VWs THAT MIKE D USED TO WEAR? I USED TO PULL THEM OFF OF CARS. I KNOW. I WAS A PUNK. I HAD LIKE 20 OF THEM AROUND MY NECK. AND MY FRIEND WAS LIKE, MAYBE TAKE IT DOWN.

YOU SHOULD SEE THIS GUY'S RECORD COLLECTION. IT'S JAY-Z. IT'S THIN LIZZY. IT'S MOZART. HIS TASTE IS DEMOCRATIC. IT'S "THE GOONIES" AND IT'S "CITIZEN KANE." THEY DON'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW. IT'S WONDERFUL.
WHEN DID "THE GOONIES" BECOME A GOOD MOVIE?
WELL, YOU SHOULD HEAR THIS GUY TALK ABOUT IT.
IT'S LIKE THEIR APARTMENT IS FULL OF EVERYTHING WE ONCE THREW OUT, BUT IT LOOKS SO GOOD THE WAY THEY HAVE IT.

YEAH, WHAT I DO IS I INVESTIGATE STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN BITTEN, PULLED UNDER THE WATER BY SOMETHING IN THE WATER. I TRY AND WORK OUT WHAT IT IS, AND THEN GET MY HANDS ON THE PERPETRATOR. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, WHAT I THEN DO, I THEN -- HAVING BROUGHT IT UP ON A LINE, BECAUSE IN CLOUDY WATER YOU GENERALLY CAN'T SEE IT -- I PUT IT BACK. AND THE MESSAGE THAT IS, IS IF ANYTHING HAPPENED, IT'S NORMALLY THE FAULT OF THE PERSON FOR BEING IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME, AND ACTUALLY NOT KNOWING ABOUT THESE CREATURES.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S NOT THE FISH'S FAULT. YEAH, EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DID YOU BRING WITH YOU? SO WHAT'S THIS GUY OVER HERE?
THIS ONE HERE'S A A PUFFER FISH.

Jimmy: YEAH. GOSH, IS THAT TEETH? NO, A BEAK.
IT'S LIKE -- THEY ARE TEETH. THERE'S 40. AND IT'S A BIT LIKE BOLT CUTTERS. AND THEY CAN CAUSE A VERY NASTY INJURY, FOR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS SO CUTE.
Jimmy: AND NOW, WHAT IS THIS GUY OVER HERE?
THESE ARE VERY INTERESTING. THIS IS A FISH FROM AFRICA CALLED A NENA.
Jimmy: A NENA.
AND I HEARD A STORY ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO WENT TO WORK AT THE MISSIONARY IN THE CONGO. HE WAS A VERY KEEN FISHERMAN. AND ON ABOUT DAY TWO, HE WENT OUT. HE'S FISHING. HE HOOKS ONE OF THESE. HE DOESN'T KNOW THE LANGUAGE. THERE'S PEOPLE ON THE BANK. THEY'RE WAVING THEIR ARMS AROUND. HE'S THINKING THEY OBVIOUSLY ARE ASKING FOR ME TO GET ONE -- YOU KNOW, TO HOLD IT UP AND SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHOOPS. SO, YOU KNOW, WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS FISH? CATFISH DON'T HAVE SCALES. THEY ARE VERY SMOOTH SKINNED. WILL, WOULD YOU LIKE TO STROKE THE CATFISH? IT'S NOT GOING TO BITE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'LL KISS THAT THING.
Jimmy: NO, YOU WANT TO KISS THE FISH? [ CHEERS ] NO, NO, I DON'T WANT TO KISS YOU. ARE YOU OKAY?
I HAVE A LITTLE CATFISH MOUTH.
Jimmy: ARE YOU CONFUSED?
I'M A BIT NAUSEATED BECAUSE IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS AN ELECTRIC CATFISH. IT'S GOT INVISIBLE POWERS. AND TO STOP STUFF EATING THEM, THEY PRODUCE AN ELECTRIC SHOCK. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU TELL ME THAT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
I MEANT TO TELL YOU EARLIER.
Jimmy: YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SUPERPOWERS.
NOTHING HAPPENED TO ME.

Jimmy: UGLY-LOOKING FISH.
THEY FEED ON THINGS LIKE DEAD WHALES, DEAD FISH. THEY WILL FIND -- HOW CAN I PUT THIS -- AN APPROPRIATE OPENING TO GO IN. AND THEY EAT THE FISH FROM THE INSIDE OUT. [ AUDIENCE GROANS ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE FUN TO HAVE AT PARTIES. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE REALLY FUN. I GOT TO INVITE YOU THE NEXT TIME I HAVE A PARTY.
THIS IS HARD TO IMAGINE. BUT THERE'S ALSO STUFF DOWN THERE THAT WANTS TO EAT THESE. SO THESE HAVE AN INTERESTING DEFENSE MECHANISM AS WELL. SO IF I CAN MAYBE DEMONSTRATE THAT. MAYBE ROLL YOUR SLEEVES UP. IF YOU CAN GET IN THERE AND JUST SORT OF TOUCH HIM A LITTLE BIT. OR JUST LEAVE HIM IN THE WATER.
