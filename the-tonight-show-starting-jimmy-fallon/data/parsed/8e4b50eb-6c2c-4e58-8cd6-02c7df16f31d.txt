UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FLORIDA IS PROUD TO ANNOUNCE AN EXCITING LINEUP OF BRAND-NEW RIDES COMING THIS SUMMER. RIDES LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATING TOWER. WATCH HOW FAST IT DROPS. AND THE HILLARY CLINTON EXPERIENCE. YOU WAIT PATIENTLY IN LINE FOR 30 YEARS, THEN WHEN IT'S FINALLY YOUR TURN, SOMEONE ELSE STEALS YOUR SEAT. [ LAUGHTER ] SEE YOU AT THE PARK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT INTERESTING? ALWAYS THINKING HERE. THEY'RE ALWAYS THINKING. THEY'RE ALWAYS THINKING HERE AT UNIVERSAL. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU WOULD RIDE THAT, TOO, YOU KNOW YOU WOULD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HEARD THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS SAVING ALL OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TWEETS SO THAT THEY CAN BE STORED IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT WAY FUTURE GENERATIONS CAN READ KENNEDY'S JOURNALS, LINCOLN'S DIARIES AND TRUMP'S INSULTS ABOUT ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THEY'RE ALL VERY HISTORIC. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THIS, IT CAME OUT THAT VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE, WON'T EAT MEALS ALONE WITH ANY WOMAN WHO IS NOT HIS WIFE.
