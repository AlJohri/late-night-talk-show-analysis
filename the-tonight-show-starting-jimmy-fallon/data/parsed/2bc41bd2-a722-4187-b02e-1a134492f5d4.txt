Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, PLEASE, PLEASE. WELCOME, WELCOME! OH, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S THE ENERGY WE WANT. THAT IS A GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD RIGHT THERE. GOING NUTS. I LOVE YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. LOVE RIGHT BACK TO YOU GUYS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU, BUDDY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS ] WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE IT'S THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION. THERE'S QUIET RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] MADE THEM STOPPED CLAPPING. THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION. I SAW TODAY DONALD TRUMP RETURNED TO CLEVELAND AHEAD OF TOMORROW NIGHT'S SPEECH. AND A LOT PEOPLE NOTED THAT TRUMP WAS GREETED BY HIS WHOLE FAMILY WHEN HE LANDED EXCEPT FOR HIS WIFE MELANIA. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] EVEN WEIRDER, MICHELLE OBAMA WAS THERE.
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW --
Steve: HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
Steve: HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ACTUALLY MELANIA'S SPEECH IS STILL GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE ALLEGATIONS THAT SHE PLAGIARIZED IT FROM A A MICHELLE OBAMA SPEECH. BUT TODAY, A TRUMP STAFFER NAMED MEREDITH McIVER TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MISTAKE. WELL, IF ANYONE WAS GOING TO CREATE A NEW SPEECH OUT OF A A BUNCH OF PIECES OF AN OLD SPEECH IT SHOULD BE SOMEBODY NAMED McIVER. [ LAUGHTER ] "QUICK, HAND ME THAT PAPERCLIP. GIVE ME THAT APPLE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IS THAT AMMONIUM NITRATE?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND DONALD TRUMP'S PICK FOR VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE IS ALREADY DOING HIS PART TO GET TRUMP ELECTED. IN FACT YESTERDAY, PENCE SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP IS QUOTE, "A BUILDER, A FIGHTER, A FATHER, AND A PATRIOT." IT'S PRETTY HIGH PRAISE RIGHT THERE. BUT PENCE WASN'T FINISHED. HE ALSO SAYS -- SAID THAT TRUMP WAS A BUTCHER, A BAKER, AND A CANDLESTICK MAKER. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HE ADDED HE'S A JOKER, HE'S A SMOKER, HE'S A MIDNIGHT TOKER. PLAYS HIS MUSIC IN THE SUN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN HE ADDED, "HE'S A BITCH, HE'S A MOTHER, HE'S A CHILD, HE'S A LOVER, HE'S A SINNER, HE'S A SAINT. HE DOES NOT FEEL ASHAMED." AND FINALLY WHEN ASKED ABOUT HIMSELF, PENCE SAID, "I'M THE EGGMAN, I AM THE WALRUS, COO-COO CACHOO." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S KIND OF LOSING -- I THINK HE'S LOSING HIS MARBLES. [ APPLAUSE ] OVER ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, HILLARY CLINTON IS STRUGGLING TO FINALLY PUT THE WHOLE E-MAIL SCANDAL BEHIND HER. SHE ACTUALLY OPENED UP ABOUT IT DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH CHARLIE ROSE THIS WEEK. AND SAID SHE'S VERY SORRY THAT SHE MADE A MISTAKE AND THAT IT WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO. HILLARY SAID IT WAS ACTUALLY EASY APOLOGIZING, YOU KNOW, AFTER HEARING BILL DO IT EVERY DAY FOR 18 YEARS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "GOOD MORNING, I'M SORRY." AND THIS WASN'T GOOD. I READ THAT THE CHIEF CREATIVE OFFICER FOR CHIPOTLE IS FACING CHARGES FOR BUYING COCAINE SEVEN TIMES SINCE JANUARY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CO-WORKERS COULD TELL HE HAD A A COCAINE PROBLEM BECAUSE NOT EVEN PEOPLE AT CHIPOTLE NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM THAT MUCH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S GOING A LOT. HE'S GOING TO THE BATHROOM A A LOT.
Steve: FREQUENT.
Jimmy: SOME PRETTY COOL TECH NEWS HERE. AVIATION COMPANIES CLAIM A A NEWLY DEVELOPED VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSET WILL ACTUALLY HELP PILOTS FLY IN POOR VISIBILITY AND LAND IN DIFFICULT CONDITIONS. SO IF YOU'RE BOARDING A PLANE AND YOU SEE A PILOT PUTTING A A GIANT BOX OVER HIS HEAD, JUST SIT BACK, RELAX, AND ENJOY THE FLIGHT. IT'S GONNA BE -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] "IT'S LIKE I'M REALLY FLYING. IT'S LIKE I'M REALLY --" "YOU ARE FLYING." [ LAUGHTER ] LISTEN TO THIS. A NEW STUDY FINDS THAT HAPPIER COWS PRODUCE HIGHER QUALITY MILK. WHEN ASKED WHAT WOULD MAKE THEM HAPPY, THE COW SAID, "HOW ABOUT A LITTLE FOREPLAY BEFORE YOU START YANKING ON MY TEATS?"
Steve: HEY! HEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHOA!

WE ALL KNOW THE PART YOU LEFT OUT OF THAT STORY. DON'T TRY TO PRETEND YOU WERE ALL HUMBLE.
Jimmy: I DID NOT DO THAT.
THAT YOU'RE THE SWEET VERSION OF JIMMY FALLON.
Jimmy: THAT IS NOT WHAT I DID AT ALL.
THAT THE PERSONA, GUYS, BUT IT'S NOT. I KNOW THE REAL JIMMY FALLON. THE REAL JIMMY FALLON SAID YOU CAN GO [ BLEEP ] YOURSELF!
Jimmy: COME ON. I DID NOT DO THAT. ♪♪
AIR PUNCH, THAT IT'S JIMMY FALLON I KNOW. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
LOOK, I'M JUST HERE TO TELL THE TRUTH. THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.
Jimmy: SOMETIMES I WISH I WAS THAT GUY.
IS THAT THE TRUTH?
Jimmy: NO.
RIGHT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S LISTENING TO SOMETHING ELSE. HE'S HAVING A GREAT CONVERSATION ON A PHONE CALL RIGHT NOW. THE MOVIE IS SUPER FUNNY, BUT ALSO KIND OF THE TOUCHING AND IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL, TOO.
IT MAKES YOU LAUGH AND CRY.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF A MOVIE. MIKE BIRBIGLIA, YOU'RE DOING WHAT WE ALL WANT.
THANKS.
Jimmy: WE WANT THESE MOVIES. YOU WANT TO LAUGH, YOU WANT TO CRY. YOU WANT THE WHOLE PACKAGE.
THOSE ARE THE KIND OF MOVIES I LIKE TO GO TO. JUDD APATOW SAW THE FILM RECENTLY THEN HE CALLED ME AND GOES, IS IT OKAY THAT I CRIED THROUGH THE LAST 20 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE? I WAS LIKE, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO HAPPEN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I FEEL VERY LUCKY THAT IT'S CONNECTING.
Jimmy: YOU DID YOUR JOB.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S TOUGH TO MAKE COMEDY THAT'S ALSO KIND OF DEALING WITH SERIOUS STUFF, TOO. LIKE YOU'RE SAYING, FAILURE, NOT FEELING LIKE YOU MADE IT OR DEATH.
SURE. AND THERE'S THIS SCENE IN THE MOVIE WHERE THESE CHARACTERS ARE BEST FRIENDS, AND I'M SURE YOU FIND THIS WHEN YOU'RE BEST FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE. YOU CAN MAKE KIND OF DARKER JOKES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IN THIS MOVIE -- RIGHT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU CAN.
YOU HAVE TO BE FRIENDS. YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING, I WAS BEING DARK. NO, BUT HERE'S WHAT'S CRAZY BECAUSE IT GETS DARKER THAN I EVEN THOUGHT.
WELL, THERE'S THIS ONE SCENE WHERE WE ARE MAKING JOKES ABOUT OUR FRIEND'S DAD WHO'S IN THE HOSPITAL. TO TRY AND COMFORT HIM, WE'RE MAKING JOKES BECAUSE HIS DAD IS LAID UP AND HE'S LIKE, THANK YOU. THEN WE'RE ON THE DRIVE HOME WE'RE LIKE, DOING MIMICKING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT'S FUNNY BUT LIKE IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHEN, IN TIMES OF CRISIS.
Jimmy: YOU TOLD ME THIS IS BASED ON --
IT'S BASED ON MY BUDDY TOLAMY WHEN HIS DAD WAS IN HARD TIMES LIKE, MANY YEARS AGO. I CALLED HIM, DO YOU MIND IF I USE THIS IN MY MOVIE? HE WAS LIKE, "NO ONE'S GOING THINK IT'S FUNNY." BUT YOU CAN USE IT. AND THEN HE GENEROUSLY LET ME USE.
Jimmy: IT IS FUNNY.
BUT THERE'S A DARKER -- AND IT'S FUNNY AND PLAYS FOR LAUGHS, BUT LIKE THERE IS A A DARKER PART OF THE REAL-LIFE STORY THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT IN THE MOVIE.
Jimmy: THIS IS INSANE, BY THE WAY.
WHEN TOLAMY'S DAD PASSED AWAY WE WENT TO CELEBRATE HIS LIFE AT BENIHANA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE BROUGHT -- TOLAMY BROUGHT HIS ASHES IN A LITTLE BAGGY. LIKE, A LITTLE BIT OF HIM. WE WERE DRINKING A BIT. AND AT ONE POINT -- WUEST, YOU CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AT ONE POINT, TOLAMY SPRINKLED A FEW OF THE ASHES ON TO THE GRIDDLE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IS THAT WHAT IT'S CALLED? THEN THE CHEF DIDN'T NOTICE. HE WAS LIKE -- AND SO WE KIND OF ATE TOLAMY'S DAD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT I DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO WEIRD.
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
BUT I CAN TELL YOU, BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS.
Jimmy: EXACTLY. SO IT'S ALL FULL CIRCLE. AND NOW WE'RE ALL FRIENDS. I WANT TO SHOW THE CLIP -- I LOVE THAT THAT'S A REAL STORY, MAN. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. THIS IS BASICALLY YOU'RE DOING AN IMPROV SCENE WHERE YOU GET SUGGESTION OUT OF THE AUDIENCE AND DO A SCENE BASED OUT OF THAT SUGGESTION. HERE'S MIKE BIRBIGLIA IN "DON'T THINK TWICE." CHECK THIS OUT.
YOU GOT INTO A TAXI. YOU DID NOT -- AND THEN YOU SAID, "HI DAD?"
YEAH, HI, DAD.
WELL, OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] WOW. HOP IN.
I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE WAS GOING TO PICK ME UP. IT'S RAINING SO HARD.
YEAH. WHERE YOU HEADED.
I'M GOING TO A RESTAURANT ON WEST 4th AND BROADWAY.
WHAT YOU GOT GOING ON THERE?
BLIND DATE WITH A MAN I'LL PROBABLY ENGAGE IN SEXUAL CONGRESS WITH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
THAT SEEMS A LITTLE FAST. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I CONSIDER MYSELF QUITE FAST. IN FACT, I HAVE ABANDONMENT ISSUES. MY FATHER LEFT ME SO I BASICALLY ONLY RELATE TO MEN THROUGH SEX.
THAT'S CHALLENGING FOR ME TO HEAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU HAVE A VOICE. YOU'RE MAKING MOVIES. WE ARE SO PSYCHED.
THANKS.
