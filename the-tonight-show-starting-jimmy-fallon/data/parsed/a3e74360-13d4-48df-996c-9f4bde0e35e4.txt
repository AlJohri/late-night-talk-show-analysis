BRAND-NEW BODY.

COME ON. YOU KNOW I'M OUT THERE --
Jimmy: NO, YOU'RE JACKED.
APPRECIATE IT.
Jimmy: IS THIS A NEW THING, DID YOU GET THIS JUST FOR THE MOVIE? HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN THIS BUILT?
I KIND OF WAS BORN JUST LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DID YOU GET THIS FILM, YOU GO, "OH, MY GOSH, I'M GOING TO DO 'CREED'"? APOLLO CREED'S SON. THE NEW GENERATION OF ROCKY MOVIES, AND DID YOU GO, "THAT'S IT. I'M JUST GONNA --" DID YOU HEAR THE ANTHEM IN YOUR HEAD?
I JUST REMEMEBERED -- I JUST REMEMBER SEEING ROCKY AND CARL -- I MEAN APOLLO CREED JUST BEING JACKED. AND I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, I GOTTA BE CLOSE. I GOTTA COME SOMEWHERE --
Jimmy: GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE.
THEY SET THE BAR SO HIGH, I JUST GOTTA BE CLOSE.
Jimmy: YEAH, BECAUSE MAN, OH, MAN. YOU LOOK GREAT. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO BOX?
NEVER BOXED BEFORE. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME GETTING A A FULL EDUCATION ON BOXING. BUT, YOU KNOW RYAN AND SLY, THEY PUT ME AROUND THE BEST BOXING MINDS POSSIBLE. I TRIED TO SOAK UP AS MUCH AS I COULD.
Jimmy: AND DO YOU STILL DO IT NOW THAT THE MOVIE'S DONE, OR NO?
I'M KIND OF IN A ROUTINE. I'M HOOKED. LIKE, BOXING IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS, IT GETS YOU IN GREAT SHAPE, YOU'RE MENTALLY FOCUSED AND DISCIPLINED. AND I JUST -- I JUST LIKE IT. YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH. AND HOW WAS WORKING WITH SYLVESTER STALLONE? WE'VE HAD HIM ON THE SHOW. HE'S THE NICEST GUY.
THE FUNNIEST GUY EVER.
Jimmy: CLASSY DUDE, TOO.
SERIOUSLY, IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU WALK IN AND YOU EXPECT, YOU KNOW, ROCKY. YOU KNOW, YOU EXPECT TO MEET ROCKY.
Jimmy: YEAH. LIKE -- [ MUMBLING ] [ LAUGHTER ] NO, AND IT'S NOT HIM AT ALL.
Jimmy: HE'S ACTING, YEAH.
HE CAN TELL YOU WHERE THIS TABLE WAS MADE FROM, WHAT KIND OF WOOD, WHY IT HAS THIS TYPE OF FINISH, WHAT KIND OF BROWN IT IS. HE'S A VERY SMART GUY.
Jimmy: YEAH, OH, HE'S THE BEST GUY. DID HE GIVE YOU TIPS ON THE MOVIE OR ON BOXING? OR DID YOU LIKE -- I WOULD ASK HIM, HOW DO I NOT GET HIT?
HOW DO I NOT --
Jimmy: I'M ASSUMING, YOU GOTTA GET PUNCHED -- TAGGED A A COUPLE TIMES.
OH, FOR SURE. AND ACTUALLY ONE OF THE TIMES THAT I DID GET HIT IN THE FILM, IT WAS HIS IDEA. HE WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT, MIKE, THIS IS YOUR INITIATION INTO THE WORLD OF BOXING." [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE WAS SMILING LIKE A A LITTLE KID. HE WAS SO HAPPY I WAS GOING TO GET HIT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LIKE, "WAIT, WHAT IS THIS?" YEAH. THIS IS HIS IDEA?
YEAH, BECAUSE WITH BOXING, YOU CAN SEE ALL THE MISSES. YOU KNOW? IF IT'S A BAD PUNCH, YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE THE AIR RIGHT BETWEEN IT, SO SOMETIMES, YOU GOTTA TAKE A REAL PUNCH. THAT'S KINDA WHAT I DID ON THIS.
Jimmy: IT'S WHAT EVERYONE WANTS, IF YOU LOVE THE "ROCKY" MOVIES, WHICH OF COURSE, EVERYONE LOVES THE "ROCKY" MOVIES. BUT IT'S GOT THAT SAME FEEL. THE REVIEWS ARE LIKE, "THIS IS WHAT THE FIRST 'ROCKY' FELT LIKE." PEOPLE ARE FREAKING OUT ABOUT THIS. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
