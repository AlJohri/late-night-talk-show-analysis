Jimmy: YOU HAVE SOME BIG NEWS FOR US. AND I'M KIND OF EXCITED THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US.
I HAVE BIG NEWS. I'M PREGNANT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HI, BABY. HI, BABY.
HI, BABY.
Jimmy: HI. I CAN'T WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE SHOW. YOU'RE MOMMY IS REALLY FUNNY. SHE'S VERY TALENTED.
YOU'RE THE FIRST TO BLESS HIM OR HER. NOW I REVEAL IT'S JUST A DISCO BALL.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. IT'S SO CUTE. IN FACT, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME BEN & JERRY'S FOR THE BABY. IT'S TONIGHT DOUGH. TONIGHT DOUGH ICE CREAM.
ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME, I LOVE BEN & JERRY'S.
Jimmy: YOU DO.
TONIGHT DOUGH -- I'M NOT JUST SAYING THIS BECAUSE IT'S YOUR SHOW. TONIGHT DOUGH IS MY FAVORITE FLAVOR. I'VE BEEN HAVING A PINT EVERY OTHER NIGHT.
Jimmy: YES! ARE YOU REALLY?
I'LL PROBABLY FALL ASLEEP WHILE I EAT THIS BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE LIKE A PAVLOVIAN RESPONSE BECAUSE I FALL ASLEEP EATING IT.
Jimmy: LIKE THE REST OF AMERICA. THIS IS PERFECT. THAT'S WHAT I DO. YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW. HI, EVERYBODY. IT'S THE GREATEST, RIGHT?
THANK YOU, YEAH.
Jimmy: THE GREATEST ICE CREAM IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
IT'S THE VERY GREATEST. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT REALLY PROVEN, BUT EVERY BABY WHO TURNS INTO BE GENIUS IF YOU EAT IT WHILE YOU'RE PREGNANT.
I'VE HEARD THAT.
Jimmy: BUT, WE HAVEN'T PROVEN IT YET.
WE'RE GOING TO IN A FEW MONTHS.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS TO MICHAEL AS WELL. MICHAEL KOMAN.
THAT'S MY HUSBAND. HE'S THE FATHER.
Jimmy: EXACTLY, YEAH. ANOTHER BIG REVEAL TONIGHT. WE DIDN'T KNOW. WE WERE GOING TO GET MAURY OUT HERE.
HE IS THE FATHER.
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK TO SECRETS, GUYS. WERE YOU PREGNANT WHILE SHOOTING --
I WAS. DURING THE SHOW. IT DIDN'T REALLY AFFECT FILMING UNTIL THE VERY END. WE HAD A TABLE READ AND MY CHARACTER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE ROLLER COASTER, ACTUALLY THE RIP RIDE ROCKET, WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN ON.
Jimmy: I RODE IT WITH KEVIN HART.
YOU RODE IT. YOU WERE A LITTLE SCARED.
Jimmy: I WAS.
YOU SWALLOWED A BUG.
Jimmy: A BUG WENT IN MY MOUTH. CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. HIT ME IN THE HEAD.
IT HIT YOU IN THE HEAD AND I'VE SEEN THE, YOU SWALLOWED IT, I THINK.
Jimmy: NO ONE BELIEVES. DUDE, I GOT HIT WITH A BUG. WHATEVER, DUDE. AND THEN WE SLOWED DOWN THIS HD FOOTAGE AND THE BUG WENT --
BUT YOU'RE SO HIGH UP, IT'S LIKE EVEREST. I DON'T KNOW HOW A BUG COULD SURVIVE UP THERE BUT IT DID.
Jimmy: WE TRAIN THEM.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE. YOU KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE THAT IS? OH, YOU CAN'T RIDE A ROLLER COASTER.
NO, I DIDN'T THINK SO. I WAS GOOGLING PREGNANT WOMEN ON -- SOME WOMEN DO. SOME REAL THRILL SEEKERS.
Jimmy: I'M SURE YOU COULD DO SOMETHING.
YOU DO. AND IT WAS STILL VERY EARLY ON. BUT, I FELT THAT A PREGNANT LADY ON A ROLLER COASTER IS NOT IDEAL. SO, I HAD TO TELL MY BOSS, TINA FEY. MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF HER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SHE KNOWS EVERY SECRET. OH, I LOVE HER.
SHE KNOWS EVERY SECRET.
Jimmy: EVERYONE TELLS HER.
I TOLD HER BEFORE I TOLD MY MOM.
Jimmy: THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU CAN TRUST TINA.
YOU CAN TRUST HER. YOU CANNOT TRUST MY MOM. YOU CAN'T. MY MOM'S HERE. BUT BECAUSE IT WAS SO EARLY ON, WE DECIDED WE'LL JUST TELL PEOPLE THAT I HAD A BACK INJURY AND THAT'S WHY I CAN'T RIDE THE ROLLER COASTER.
Jimmy: THAT MAKES SENSE.
MAKES SENSE. I COULD NOT ACT LIKE I HAD A A BACK INJURY. I'M AN ACTRESS. I COULD NOT ACT LIKE I HAD A -- OH, IT WAS SO. AND I GUESS SOMEONE SAID, WHAT'S WRONG? AND LIKE WORDS ESCAPED ME. I SPRAINED MY SPINE. LIKE, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A BAD LIAR.
I'M A BAD LIAR. I KEPT FORGETTING I HAD ONE. SO I WOULD DO THINGS SOMEONE LIKE A BACK INJURY CAN'T DO. I WOULD LEAP UP AND CARTWHEEL TO CATERING.
Jimmy: NOT A GOOD IDEA. YOU CAN'T DO THAT, NO.
AT THE WRAP PARTY I COMPLETELY FORGOT. YOU SAW ME DANCE. I'M DANCING MY FRIEND ALEC CAME UP AND SHE WAS LIKE, "HOW IS YOUR BACK?" IT'S OKAY.
Jimmy: CAN WE LOWER THE MUSIC?
THE DOCTOR SAID THAT DANCING COULD BE GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS TERRIBLE. I THINK EVERYONE SAW THROUGH IT.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS. WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER FOR YOU.
THANK YOU. OH, YOU'RE VERY KIND.
Jimmy: COME ON. IT'S THE BEST THING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: THE BEST THING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.
AND I HOPE YOUR DAUGHTERS ARE WELL.
Jimmy: THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. EXPLAIN THIS SHOW, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN "UNBREAKABLE KIMMY SCHMIDT," IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME JUMPING IN.
YES.
Jimmy: DO YOU HAVE ONE LINE TO EXPLAIN THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT GOOD AT IT?
IT'S A VERY WEIRD SHOW. IT'S ABOUT A WOMAN, ME, WHO ESCAPES FROM A DOOMS DAY CULT AND STARTS HER LIFE OVER IN NEW YORK CITY.
Jimmy: PERFECT. THAT'S EXACTLY IT.
YOUR STORY. YOUR STORY.
Jimmy: MY STORY. EXACTLY. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.
TINA BASED IT ON YOU.
Jimmy: SHE BASED IT ON MY LIFE STORY. YEAH. IT IS UNBELIEVABLY FUNNY.
IT'S BRILLIANT.
Jimmy: EVERYBODY, THE CO-STARS.
YOU'RE SO NICE. IT'S WRITTEN BY GENIUSES. AND THE CAST IS EXTRAORDINARY.
Jimmy: THEY SQUEEZE EVERY --
EVERY NUGGET. AND EVERY JOKE HAS LIKE FIVE LAYERS.
Jimmy: FROM THE THEME SONG THROUGH THE SHOW.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S COMEDY, COMEDY, COMEDY AND JUST WORTH IT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: OH, PLEASE. I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP. HERE'S ELLIE KEMPER IN "UNBREAKABLE KIMMY SCHMIDT." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WHAT'S WRONG KIM?
I DON'T KNOW TITUS, WHAT IS WRONG? WHAT'S RIGHT? WHAT'S JUST EHH?
I FIND THAT LIFE IS MOSTLY GRAY AREAS ESPECIALLY THE PARTS I CAN'T REACH WITH MOISTURIZER.
UH-HUH, IS THAT WHY YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OKAY TO BE SO MEAN TO VONDA?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. BECAUSE IN THE MOVIE I SAW I WAS A HERO SCORING A LEGAL VICTORY FOR YOUNG RENEGADES EVERYWHERE.
YOU COULDN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE TO HER.
THERE ARE THREE THINGS TITUS ANDROMEDON DOES NOT DO, APOLOGIES, DRAG AND CALCULUS.
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK MAYBE YOU WERE A BETTER PERSON BACK WHEN YOU WERE RONALD WILKERSON.
WE'LL NEVER KNOW BECAUSE RONALD WILKERSON'S DEAD.
YOU'RE JUST MR. SASSAFRAS JEANS TODAY.
THAT'S A DUMB NAME FOR HOW FIERCE I'M BEING RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: MR. SASSAFRAS JEANS. JUST PICKED UP FOR SEASON THREE. CONGRATULATIONS. DOUBLE CONGRATULATIONS.
