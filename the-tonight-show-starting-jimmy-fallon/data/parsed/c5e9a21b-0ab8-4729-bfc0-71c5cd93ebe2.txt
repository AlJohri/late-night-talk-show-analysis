JIMMY, YOU CLEAN UP WELL. THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS PRE-TAPED. IT WASN'T.
Jimmy: OH, NO, THAT WAS ALL --
UNBELIEVABLE.
Jimmy: WE HAVE THE BEST HAIR AND MAKEUP, WARDROBE. THEY'RE THE GREATEST. THEY CLEAN EVERYTHING UP. I STILL GOT STAINS EVERYWHERE.
I WAS CONVULSING.
Jimmy: I HAVE WHIPPED CREAM -- OH MY GOSH.
CONVULSING.
Jimmy: THANK YOU MY FRIEND. I'VE HAD YOU -- WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME. SO HAPPY TO SPEND A LITTLE THANKSGIVING WITH YOU.
I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE FOR THANKSGIVING. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THEY ALL LOVE YOU. YOU HAVE A THANKSGIVING MEMORY. I KNOW YOU WERE TELLING ME BACKSTAGE. YOU HAD A -- YOU HAD A GOOD DOG. WHAT WAS YOUR DOG'S NAME?
SPOTTY. MY VERY FIRST DOG. I LOVED AND ADORED HER.
Jimmy: SHE WAS A BAD DOG?
WELL SHE WAS --
Jimmy: MISCHIEVOUS?
MISCHIEVOUS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SHE LIKED TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. MY MOTHER WAS COOKING IN THE KITCHEN. IT WAS HOT. SHE OPENED UP THE KITCHEN DOOR THAT LED TO THE BACKYARD. THERE WAS A SCREEN. SPOTTY, FOR SOME REASON, JUST DOVE THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR, MADE A HOLE, CHARGED OUT INTO THE WOODS. AND I WAS READY TO GO AFTER HER. MY MOTHER SAID, "NO, NO, NO NO. SHE'LL RUN AROUND, SHE'LL COME BACK." WELL, SHE DID. MOTHER HAD SET THE TABLE. WE HAD THE TURKEY AND DRESSING AND EVERYTHING. AND SPOTTY CAME BACK, BOUNDING THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR IN THE HOLE, AND DEPOSITED THIS GRAY, FURRY MASS OF BLOOD AND BONES ON THE TABLE. SHE HAD MANGLED A WILD RABBIT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT I HAVE TO SAY, SHE WAS NEATER AND THE RABBIT WAS NEATER THAN YOU AND KEVIN.
Jimmy: OH, YES. [ LAUGHTER ] OH YES, THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. SURE.
NICE AND CONTAINED.
Jimmy: PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE HITTING THE GYM TOMORROW. I WAS SAYING TO YOU BACK STAGE, YOU LOOK -- THAT YOU'RE EXTRA FIT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: REALLY GREAT SHAPE, BU YOU LOOK EXTRA FIT.

Jimmy: SWIMMING.

Jimmy: JIM MOOREHOUSE?
FENCER. AND HE OPENED A FENCING CLUB AND I MET HIM. I'M ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT LIFE'S SERENDIPITOUS PATH. YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU. WELL, IT TOOK ME TO HIM. AND I WENT TO THE FENCING CLUB AND THOUGHT, "THIS LOOKS REALLY INTRIGUING." I MEAN, AT AGE 62, IT WAS A A YEAR AGO, I'M GOING TO BECOME A JOCK? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, HASN'T HAPPENED TO ME IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
Jimmy: LET'S NOT GO THAT FAR. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, IT'S HAPPENED TO ME. I HAVE BEEN BITTEN BY THE BUG.
Jimmy: A JOCK? I MEAN, FENCING?
AND TIM MOORHOUSE GOT ME INTO MY FIRST PAIR OF SWEATPANTS. HONESTLY. [ SCATTERED CHEERS ]

Jimmy: HEY, THAT'S PRETTY FANTASTIC.

I HAVE A LOVE-HATE WITH ROLLER COASTERS. I LOVE TO HATE THEM. AND I HATE TO LOVE THEM.
Jimmy: DON'T LIKE THEM AT ALL.
WELL NO, NO. I'M KIND OF AN ADDICT WHEN IT COMES TO ROLLER COASTERS TOO. I REALLY LOVE THEM, BUT I SCREAM LIKE A LITTLE KID.
Jimmy: YES! THAT'S THE FUN OF IT. I WANT TO GO ON WITH YOU.
IF YOU AND I DO IT TOGETHER AND WE'RE BOTH SCREAMING, FINE. EXCEPT I WANT AN AMBULANCE AT THE OTHER END.
Jimmy: NO, NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. THIS IS LIKE MORE -- IT JUST GOES THIS WAY AND THAT WAY.
OH, ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: YOU GET HIT WITH -- YOU GO IN THE EAST RIVER. YOU GET HIT WITH WATER. YOU SMELL PIZZA AT ONE POINT.
