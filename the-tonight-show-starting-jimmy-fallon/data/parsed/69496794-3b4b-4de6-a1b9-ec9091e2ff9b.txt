Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- CATE BLANCHETT, ANTHONY MACKIE, MUSICAL GUEST TINASHE, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 368.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU FOR THE LOVE. I LOVE YOU RIGHT BACK. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU MADE IT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELL, HERE'S THE LATEST ON THE ELECTION, EVERYBODY. THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WENT HEAD TO HEAD SATURDAY NIGHT IN THEIR SECOND DEBATE, WHERE UNLIKE THE RONDA ROUSEY FIGHT, WE SAW A WOMAN KNOCK OUT TWO OPPONENTS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE UPDATE. AND GET THIS, CBS ACTUALLY ENDED THE DEBATE SEVEN MINUTES BEFORE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO FINISH. YEAH, OR AS BILL CLINTON PUT IT, "OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE HOME EARLY. HEY, THIS IS VANESSA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SHE'S HELPING ME WITH MY TAXES. GET OUT OF HERE. THAT WAS AN INTRUDER, GET LOST. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DID THEY GET IN HERE?" ACTUALLY, DATA FROM SOCIAL MEDIA AND GOOGLE SHOWED THAT BERNIE SANDERS WAS THE MOST TALKED ABOUT OF THE THREE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES AFTER THE DEBATE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BERNIE CAME IN FIRST. HILLARY CAME IN SECOND. AND SOMEHOW, MARTIN O'MALLEY CAME IN FOURTH. I DON'T KNOW HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ONLY THREE --
Steve: WOW. FOURTH PLACE?
Jimmy: DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S MAKE SENSE. THAT'S RIGHT, ONLINE DATA SHOWS THAT BERNIE SANDERS WON THE DEBATE, BUT A POLL FUNDED BY A A HILLARY CLINTON SUPER PAC SAID THAT HILLARY WON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I THINK THE POLL MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIASED. CHECK OUT WHAT IT SAID HERE. WHO WON THE DEBATE? HILLARY, HILLARY CLINTON, OR HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT SEEMS A LITTLE, IT SEEMS A A LITTLE ONE SIDED. AND APPARENTLY, BERNIE SANDERS IS POLLING THE HIGHEST AMONG VOTERS WHO EARN MORE THAN $100,000 A YEAR. MAINLY BECAUSE GIVING HIM A A MUSTACHE AND A TOP HAT WOULD MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE A MONOPOLY GUY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THERE YOU GO. THAT MAKES SENSE. ACTUALLY, THINGS GOT PRETTY HEATED AT TIMES DURING THIS WEEKEND'S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE. BUT MARTIN O'MALLEY SAVED HIS BIGGEST INSULTS FOR DONALD TRUMP. CHECK THIS OUT.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, AND LET'S SAY IT IN OUR DEBATE BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER HEAR IT FROM THAT IMMIGRANT BASHING, CARNIVAL BARKER DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS --
Jimmy: WOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TRUMP WAS LIKE, "IS THIS BECAUSE I GOT MY HAIR FROM THE COTTON CANDY MACHINE? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IS THAT WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT?" CARNIVAL BARKER. GUYS, WE'RE A WEEK AND A HALF AWAY FROM THANKSGIVING. THAT'S RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LOVE THANKSGIVING. JUST A REMINDER IN CASE YOU NEED TO STOCK UP ON SOME THINGS FOR DINNER WITH YOUR FAMILY, NAPKINS, WINE, NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONES, A LITTLE MORE WINE. JUST THE BASICS. [ APPLAUSE ] DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS, THE BUTTERBALL TURKEY HOTLINE. YOU KNOW THAT? A PHONE NUMBER YOU CAN CALL TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO COOK A TURKEY OR WHATEVER, BAKE A A TURKEY. ANYWAYS, THEY REVEALED SOME OF THE WEIRDEST QUESTIONS THAT THEY'VE GOTTEN. OKAY, ONE PERSON WANTED TO GO HOW TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A A TURKEY HAS A BIKINI SHAPED TAN LINE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS THINKING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WORSE, THAT QUESTION OR THAT MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS, EASY, JUST PUT A A BIKINI ON IT. A LITTLE BIKINI. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LIKE A LITTLE ALUMINUM FOIL BIKINI.
Steve: YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. LIKE THE PILGRIMS DID.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: GUYS, I SAW THAT THEY JUST HAD THE ANNUAL ROYAL VARIETY PERFORMANCE IN THE UK WHERE MUSICIANS LIKE ONE DIRECTION PERFORM FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY. OF COURSE, THE QUEEN WASN'T THAT INTO IT BECAUSE SHE STOPPED LIKING ONE DIRECTION WHEN ZAYN QUIT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY SHOULD HAVE LET HIM SING MORE. YOU KNOW, I JUST READ IN A A RECENT INTERVIEW THAT THE MAN WHO INVENTED IBUPROFEN --
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: HE SAID HE KNEW IT WORKED WHEN HE TESTED OUT SOME TO CURE A HANGOVER BEFORE GIVING AN IMPORTANT SPEECH. YEAH. WHILE UNFORTUNATELY, THE MAN WHO INVENTED VIAGRA TESTED IT OUT BEFORE GIVING A WEDDING TOAST.
Steve: OH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AND THAT WAS JUST AWFUL. I COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED FOR YOU GUYS. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST CAUGHT THE BOUQUET. I JUST CAUGHT THE BOUQUET. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FINALLY, THIS DOESN'T REALLY SURPRISE ME. RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT STAYING OFF FACEBOOK CAN ACTUALLY MAKE YOU HAPPIER. RESEARCHERS RECOMMEND WAITING UNTIL YOU'RE AT YOUR HAPPIEST AND THEN GOING ON FACEBOOK, SO YOU COULD RUB IT IN EVERYONE'S FACE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M GETTING MARRIED AND I'M HAVING A BABY, AND I JUST MADE SOME LEMON BARS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: THAT IS THE ONE AND ONLY JOHN PIZZARELLI SITTING IN WITH THE ROOTS TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY! FANTASTIC. JOHN'S NEW ALBUM "MIDNIGHT McCARTNEY" IS OUT NOW. THIS IS ACTUALLY A COOL RECORD. THIS IS ACTUALLY PAUL McCARTNEY'S IDEA FOR THIS ALBUM, RIGHT?
HE WROTE ME A LETTER AND SAID THAT HE HAD THREE IDEAS. AND ONE OF THEM WAS RECORD A A RECORD OF MY POST-BEATLES SONGS. THE SECOND WAS IF YOU LIKE IT, YOU CAN CALL IT "MIDNIGHT McCARTNEY," AND THIRD ONE WAS, MAYBE WITH A DISHY LITTLE PICTURE OF YOU AGAINST THE MANHATTAN SKYLINE. SO THERE WERE THREE IDEAS AND THEY ALL GOT DONE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. BASICALLY MADE THIS ALBUM. IT'S FANTASTIC. JOHN IS ALSO PERFORMING RIGHT HERE AT THE CAFE CARLYLE FOR THE REST OF THE MONTH. AND I'VE SEEN HIM, I'VE SEEN THE SHOW. I CAN'T WAIT, I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHEN I'M GOING, BUT, UNLESS IT'S SOLD OUT ALREADY, BUT I'M GOING TO COME SEE IT.
WE CAN SNEAK YOU IN.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, BUDDY. I APPRECIATE THAT. JOHN PIZZARELLI HERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FANTASTIC. HEY, EVERYONE. I WANTED TO SAY A HELLO AND A A HI AND A HUG FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WATCHING OUR SHOW IN PARIS. AND ALL OVER THE WORLD, REALLY. WHAT HAPPENED LAST FRIDAY NIGHT CHANGED US. AND WE'RE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAN WE WERE AT 4:00 LAST FRIDAY. THOSE SHOOTINGS AND BOMBINGS WERE SET OUT TO DESTROY US AND DESTROY HUMANITY, BUT GUESS WHAT? IT BACKFIRED. BECAUSE INSTEAD, THOSE EVENTS BROUGHT US ALL EVEN CLOSER TOGETHER. AND THE KERNEL OF ALL THIS DESTRUCTION BECAME LOVE AROUND THE WORLD. AND I WAS WATCHING NEWS IN SYDNEY, IN BRAZIL, AND HERE IN MANHATTAN, OF COURSE, IN NEW YORK CITY, WE'RE ALL SHOWING OUR SUPPORT, AND WE'RE CLOSER NOW THAN WE HAVE EVER, EVER BEEN. I CAN FEEL IT. SO FROM ALL OF US HERE AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW," OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH THE FAMILIES AND FRIENDS OF THE VICTIMS, AND WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE BELIEVE IN YOU AND YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING BY GOING OUTSIDE AND EATING AT RESTAURANTS AND BRINGING YOUR KIDS TO THE PARK AND GOING TO MOVIES. I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE NEWS ALL WEEKEND AND THEY ARE DOING IT. THEY'RE LIVING THEIR LIVES WITHOUT FEAR. SHOWING US THE BEST WAY TO MOURN THE DEAD IS TO LIVE, TO LIVE THROUGH IT. YOU'RE SETTING A GREAT EXAMPLE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS. THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. I HOPE WE COULD BE A MOMENT OF JOY THROUGH THESE TOUGH TIMES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EVERYBODY, IT'S MONDAY. IT'S MONDAY, WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO BE BACK HERE. WE HAVE A BIG WEEK OF SHOWS COMING UP. TOMORROW NIGHT, JUST TOMORROW NIGHT ALONE, ROONEY MARA WILL BE HERE, JESSE TYLER FERGUSON WILL BE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JUSTIN BIEBER WILL BE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL TOMORROW. PLUS, MY MAN JEFF GORDON WILL BE DROPPING BY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A SPECIAL RACE PLANNED WITH A FEW OTHER NASCAR FRIENDS, SO BE SURE TO TUNE IN FOR THAT. IT'S ONE OF THE CRAZIEST THINGS THAT WE'LL EVER DO. THAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT. LATER ON THIS WEEK, JENNIFER LAWRENCE, RACHEL WEISZ, AND GORDON RAMSAY WILL BE YELLING AT ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "JIMMY, YOU DON'T COOK IT LIKE THAT! YOU CALL THIS SCRAMBLED EGGS, DONKEY?" [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, HE'LL BE YELLING AT ME. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PERFORMANCE FROM JEFF LYNNE'S ELO AND R. KELLY. IT'S GONNA TO BE GOOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT FIRST, WE'RE SO HAPPY TO HAVE HER VISITING THE SHOW. THERE'S SO MUCH BUZZ AROUND HER NEW MOVIE "CAROL." CATE BLANCHETT IS HERE TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: YES.
Jimmy: GORGEOUS, BEAUTIFUL, TALENTED. CATE IS GOING TO TELL US ABOUT "CAROL," AND THEN SHE AND I ARE GOING TO DO SOME SERIOUS ACTING TOGETHER IN A BIT WE CALL LIP FLIP.
Steve: WOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

Steve: YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AND WE HAVE GREAT MUSIC FROM TINASHE, EVERYBODY.
Steve: OH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: FANTASTIC. TWITTER IS ALL ABUZZ. DO YOU GUYS EVER GO ON TWITTER? YEAH, YEAH. YOU EVER SEE A TWEET FROM A A CELEBRITY THAT LOOKS LIKE IT MAKES NO SENSE, AND THEN IT'S LIKE A RANDOM STATEMENT OUT OF LIKE LEFT FIELD, BUT THEN YOU CLICK EXPAND AND YOU REALIZE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY RESPONDING TO ANOTHER PERSON'S QUESTION. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IN THE NEXT SEGMENT. IT'S TIME FOR "IN REPLY TO." HERE WE GO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: I MAY BE WRONG. LET'S SEE WHAT THEY WERE ASKED. "HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE JEB BUSH?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHY WOULD THEY BE ASKED THAT QUESTION? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A FUNNY THING.
Steve: IT SEEMS CRUEL.
Jimmy: HERE'S ONE FROM BEN CARSON, HE RESPONDED, "SANTA CLAUS, THE EASTER BUNNY, AND THE TOOTH FAIRY, TO NAME A A FEW." SEE WHAT HE WAS ASKED? "WHO WERE YOUR ROOM MATES IN COLLEGE?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY.

Jimmy: SEEMS A LITTLE LAST MINUTE. SEEMS A LITTLE LAST MINUTE.
Steve: I MEAN, THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME.
Jimmy: I KNOW, THEY HAVE GREAT THINGS THERE.
Steve: THEY DO.

JIMMY, DO YOU WANT TO WRITE THAT DOWN?
Jimmy: I'M GOING TO WRITE THAT DOWN.
I'LL DRAW YOU SOME DIAGRAMS LATER. [ LAUGHTER ]

I MEAN, IT'S SET IN THE '50s WHEN OBVIOUSLY, WHEN THAT KIND OF LOVE WAS ILLEGAL. AND IT'S FROM PATRICIA HIGHSMITH'S NOVEL, "THE PRICE OF SALT," AND IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE '50s. SHE'S THE MISTRESS OF CRIME. BUT THIS TIME, KIND OF A LOVE WITH THE CRIME.
Jimmy: AND YOU HAVE -- YOU JUST MEET ROONEY MARA'S CHARACTER, AND THEN YOU --
WHO WOULDN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH ROONEY MARA? THE SUBJECT WAS EASY.
Jimmy: THAT WAS THE EASY PART, YEAH.
THAT WAS EASY.
Jimmy: BUT THEN YOU SEE, BECAUSE YOUR HUSBAND -- YOU HAVE A HUSBAND, YOU HAVE --
I HAVE A CHILD, AND SO IT GETS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY AN AGE GAP BETWEEN THE WOMEN, SO IT'S REALLY -- IT'S A COMPLICATED, BUT PASSIONATE LOVE. YOU KNOW, LIKE "BRIEF ENCOUNTER," WHICH IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE FILMS. IT HAS THAT EPIC ROMANTIC QUALITY. AND IN THE END, THE WOMEN ARE THE SAME GENDER IS REALLY IMPORTANT, BUT IT'S ALSO -- THE LOVE STORY IS KIND OF GREATER THAN ANY OF THOSE THINGS, I THINK.
Jimmy: IT'S TRICKY, AND TO SEE IT, IT'S WELL PLAYED. YOU DO SUCH A GREAT JOB. WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. IT'S CATE BLANCHETT AND ROONEY MARA'S FIRST MEETING IN THE NEW FILM "CAROL." CHECK THIS OUT.
