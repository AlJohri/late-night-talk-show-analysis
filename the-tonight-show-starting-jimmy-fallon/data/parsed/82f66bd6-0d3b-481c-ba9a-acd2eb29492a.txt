[LAUGHTER] "WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WANT PIZZA AS A TOPPING ON YOUR PIZZA?" "I KNOW MY RIGHTS, MAN!" [LAUGHTER] LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON. IN HIS WEEKLY ADDRESS TO THE NATION ON SATURDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT THE U.S. MUST ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE IT CAN NO LONGER BE DENIED OR IGNORED. THEN TEDCRUZ SAID, "NO, BUT IT CAN BE DENIED AND IGNORED." [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S MY NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, "IT CAN BE DENIED AND IGNORED." SPEAKING OF OBAMA. LAST WEEK, HE APPOINTED A NEW WHITE HOUSE SOCIAL SECRETARY, WHO FOCUSES ON WELCOMING VISITORS. AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAKE VISITORS FEEL WELCOME-- THE SECRET SERVICE. [LAUGHTER] COME ON IN! DOOR'S WIDE OPEN. GO AHEAD AND HAVE FUN. [LAUGHTER] WE HAVE A BOGEY-- THIS ISN'T PLUGGED IN, I'M KIDDING, GO ON IN. [LAUGHTER] IT'S FUN IN THERE. SEEMS LIKE SECURITY IS STILL A PROBLEM IN WASHINGTON. JUST YESTERDAY THEY HAD ANOTHER PERSON JUMP THE FENCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. AND OF COURSE LAST WEEK A POSTAL WORKER FROM FLORIDA LANDED A HELICOPTER-- [LAUGHTER] ON THE WEST LAWN OF THE CAPITOL BUILDING. YOU CAN TELL THE GUY WORKED FOR THE POST OFFICE, 'CAUSE A U.P.S. GUY WOULD HAVE JUST THROWN THE HELICOPTER ON THE FRONT PORCH. [LAUGHTER] "MIGHT BE A LITTLE DAMAGED." [APPLAUSE] AND I SAW THAT TOMORROW, OBAMA WILL HOST NASCAR CHAMPION KEVINHARVICK AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THE TWO SAID THEY BOTH LOOK FORWARD TO SPENDING AN HOUR OR TWO NOT HAVING THE SLIGHTEST INTEREST IN WHAT THE OTHER IS SAYING. [LAUGHTER] [BARACK OBAMA IMPRESSION] NASCAR, SOUNDS GREAT. "UH-- OBAMACARE? I HAVE NOTHING. LET'S TAKE A PICTURE AND GET THIS OVER WITH." [LAUGHTER] THIS IS PRETTY BIG. I AM SO PSYCHED ABOUT THIS STORY.

TO CELEBRATE, TEBOW THREW A HUGE PARTY-- WHICH WAS INTERCEPTED AND RETURNED FOR A TOUCHDOWN. [LAUGHTER] BUT STILL, HE THREW IT, HE THREW THE PARTY. [LIGHT LAUGHTER] THIS MADE ME LAUGH.

NO.
Jimmy: NO, I LOVE HIM.
Jimmy: YOU ARE WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND-- CAN I SAY YOUR BOYFRIEND?
SURE.
Jimmy: BOBBYCANNAVALE, WHO'S A GREAT ACTOR.
HE IS, HE IS.
Jimmy: I LOVE BOBBY. HE'S AWESOME, YEAH. AND YOU GUYS ARE DATING NOW, AND YOU TOOK HIM TO SEE WHERE YOU ARE FROM IN AUSTRALIA.
I DID, YEAH. WE WENT TO AUSTRALIA, WENT TO SYDNEY AND WE WENT ALL AROUND. AND THEN WE WENT-- MY PARENTS LIVE IN TASMANIA, WHICH IS A KIND OF REMOTE PART OF AUSTRALIA. AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY. THEY HAVE ANIMALS EVERYWHERE, LIKE KANGAROOS IN THE MORNING.
Jimmy: HOW DID HE DEAL WITH THIS? HE'S A REAL NEW YORKER.
HE IS. HE'S OKAY. HE'S PRETTY LIKE, "OH, MY GOD! THERE IT IS!" YOU KNOW. LIKE, HE GETS REALLY SURPRISED. BUT THERE'S THIS INCREDIBLE--
Jimmy: DID YOU SURPRISE HIM WITH ANIMALS? LIKE, GO INTO THE ROOM LIKE, "AH!" THERE'S A KANGAROO IN THE ROOM. LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
"WHAT'S THAT?" BUT WE DID-- YEAH, WE HAD-- ONE MORNING WE WOKE UP, AND THERE'S A BIRD IN AUSTRALIA CALLED A KOOKABURRA.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
WHICH IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL NATIVE BIRD, AND IT MAKES A REALLY INTERESTING SOUND. WHICH I'LL TRY AND DO. IT'S LIKE-- [IMITATING BIRD CALL] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO IT REALLY DOES SOUND LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I'M NOT MAKING IT UP. IT'S EVEN LOUDER THAN THAT. IT'S A REALLY CRAZY SOUND. ANYWAY, I'M SO USED TO IT. SO YOU WAKE UP AND YOU HEAR THESE-- IT'S REALLY WHEN YOU'RE IN THE COUNTRY AND STUFF, NOT IN THE CITY AS MUCH. ANYWAY, HE WOKE UP AND WAS LIKE, "WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT NOISE?!" [LAUGHTER] [IMITATING BIRD CALL]
THERE YOU GO! YOU GOT IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, JUST SCREAM? IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE BEING MURDERED.
AND I WAS LIKE, "IT'S A KOOKABURRA."
Jimmy: HELLO? YEAH.
YOU KNOW, LIKE DUH. AND HE'S LIKE, "OKAY, IT'S A KOOKABURRA." SO WE HAD A LITTLE--
Jimmy: HE'S A GREAT GUY. GIVE HIM MY BEST.
I WILL. I WILL.
Jimmy: HE GOES TO THESE CHARADE PARTIES TOO? [LAUGHTER] I'M GOING TO CALL HARRY.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
Jimmy: NO BIG DEAL. IT'S COOL. I'M BUSY EVERY NIGHT. [LAUGHTER]
YEAH. WELL, YOU ARE. YOU WOULD BE TOO GOOD. THAT'S PROBABLY WHY YOU DON'T GET THE INVITE. [LAUGHTER]
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T EVEN COMMIT TO THAT. YOU BAILED HALFWAY THROUGH. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNEW WHEN YOU WERE SAYING IT -- "WHAT'S GONNA MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER? YEAH, IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO GOOD. THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T LIKE YOU."
YOU'RE TOO GOOD. YOU'RE TOO GOOD.
Jimmy: DID YOU MEET BOBBY ON THIS NEW MOVIE?
NO, NO, IT'S THROUGH FRIENDS. BUT YEAH, WE'VE DONE THREE JOBS TOGETHER. WE DID "ANNIE," WE'VE DONE THIS, AND THEN "SPY" WE HAVE COMING OUT AS WELL. SO YEAH, BUT "ADULT BEGINNERS" WAS-- YEAH, WE SHOT THAT ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
Jimmy: "ADULT BEGINNERS"-- IT'S A COMEDY, BUT IT'S ALSO DRAMATIC. IT'S GREAT. BUT NICKKROLL IS REALLY FUNNY.
NICKKROLL, WHO'S HYSTERICAL.
Jimmy: HE'S SO GOOD. YEAH, "THE KROLL SHOW," IF YOU KNOW HIM.
HE'S GREAT.
Jimmy: CAN YOU SET IT UP AT ALL?
YEAH, SO IT'S ABOUT A YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR, NICKKROLL, WHO SORT OF LOSES HIS WHOLE COMPANY AT THE START OF THE FILM. AND HE COMES TO LIVE WITH ME, HIS ESTRANGED SISTER, AND ENDS UP BEING MY MANNY. NANNY MANNY, YOU KNOW. HE'S LOOKING AFTER THE KIDS. IT'S REALLY, REALLY SWEET, A GEM. REALLY, REALLY FUNNY.
Jimmy: I WAS CHECKING IT OUT ON ROTTEN TOMATOES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU FOLLOW THAT STUFF, BUT IT'S GOT A 100% FRESH.
AW, THANK-- WOW.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT IS A FRESH TOMATO. [LAUGHTER] YEAH. WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. IT IS ROSEBYRNE IN "ADULT BEGINNERS."
Jimmy: I WAS CHECKING IT OUT ON ROTTEN TOMATOES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU FOLLOW THAT STUFF, BUT IT'S GOT A 100% FRESH.
AW, THANK-- WOW.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT IS A FRESH TOMATO. [LAUGHTER] YEAH. WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. IT IS ROSEBYRNE IN "ADULT BEGINNERS." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

WHAT IS THAT FACE? I KNOW THAT FACE.
WHAT FACE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU WERE ASKING A SEX FLASHBACK.
I WASN'T HAVING A "SEX FLASHBACK."

NOTHING. NO.
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN HERE TWO MONTHS AND YOU'RE ALREADY F-U-[BLEEP]I-N-G SOMEBODY.
