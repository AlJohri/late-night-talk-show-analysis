[ AUDIENCE OHS ] OR -- OR AS HILLARY CALLS THAT, FIVE YEARS UNTIL MY RE-ELECTION. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT SHE CALLS IT. THAT'S RIGHT, THEY'RE SAYING THIS WEEK MARKS ONE YEAR UNTIL THE 2016 ELECTION. EVEN CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS AT CVS ARE LIKE WAIT, "ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THIS, IT'S A A LITTLE BIT TOO EARLY?" [ LAUGHTER ] COME ON. NOT EVEN A YEAR OUT. AND AS I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD, DONALD TRUMP IS IN THE BUILDING GETTING READY TO HOST "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." [ CHEERS ] THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF ANTI-TRUMP PROTESTERS OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OR AS TRUMP PUT IT, "THOSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LINING UP FOR DAYS TO SEE ME, THEY LOVE ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE LINING UP AROUND THE BLOCK. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE." SPEAKING OF TRUMP IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY HE AND CNN ANCHOR CHRIS CUOMO GOT INTO A A HEATED ARGUMENT AFTER TRUMP REPEATEDLY INSULTED REPORTER SARA MURRAY. YEP. CNN WAS LIKE, "GUYS, KEEP IT DOWN, YOU'LL WAKE THE VIEWERS." [ LAUGHTER ] WE HATE TO SEE THAT.

HE'S GOING TO HOST A NEW DATING SHOW ON WE TV CALLED "DRIVEN TO LOVE" WHERE HE DRIVES PEOPLE AROUND IN THE BACK OF HIS SUV TO LOOK FOR POTENTIAL DATES ON THE STREET.

[ LAUGHTER ] COME ON, I'M DRIVING, ALL RIGHT? I'LL LEAVE THE WINDOW OPEN, ALL RIGHT? OVER HERE. OR WHATEVER. OVER HERE, OVER THERE. THIS ISN'T GOOD, GUYS. THE EPA JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IN ADDITION TO VOLKSWAGON, SOME PORSCHES ALSO FALSIFIED THEIR EMISSIONS TESTS AS WELL. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] YEAH. HERE'S WHAT A PORSCHE OWNER HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE NEWS THAT HIS CAR'S EMISSIONS WERE ACTUALLY WORSE THAN ADVERTISED. HE SAID "I BOUGHT MY PORSCHE BECAUSE I HAVE AN UNUSUALLY SMALL PENIS SO THIS DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE DOESN'T CARE. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE EMISSIONS.
Steve: HE DOESN'T CARE AT ALL.
Jimmy: JUST ONE EXAMPLE. ONE PERSON RANDOMLY ASKED. FINALLY, GUYS, THIS IS KIND OF INTERESTING. A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT NEARLY 80% OF PEOPLE WHO SLEEPWALK DON'T FEEL PAIN WHILE THEY'RE DOING IT.

I WATCH IT A LOT.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A GREAT IRISH BROGUE THERE. BUT, YOU, ACTUALLY YOU WERE BORN HERE IN NEW YORK. IS THAT RIGHT?
I WAS BORN IN THE BRONX.
Jimmy: YEAH. VERY COOL.
WHICH, I'M SURE YOU COULD PICK UP.
Jimmy: YEAH, AS SOON AS YOU STARTED TALKING, I WAS LIKE THAT'S A BRONX --
SHE'S A BRONX.
Jimmy: THAT'S A BRONX ACCENT, YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
MYSELF AND J.LO. WE'RE FROM THE SAME BLOCK.
Jimmy: YOU'RE FROM THE SAME BLOCK. THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE FROM A SIMILAR BLOCK.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE SAOIRSE FROM THE BLOCK.
I'M SAOIRSE FROM THE BLOCK.
Jimmy: SAOIRSE FROM THE BLOCK, ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THE BRONX GROWING UP? DO YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THE FUN STUFF ABOUT BEING HERE?
I MEAN, I WAS ONLY THERE TIL I WAS 3. BUT --
Jimmy: DON'T REMEMBER MUCH.
NO, BUT I REMEMBER. SHE USED TO GO TO THIS SUPERMARKET THAT WAS -- I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR AWAY IT WAS, BUT SHE USED TO TAKE ME IN THE STROLLER WHEN I WAS A A TODDLER, AND, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS GETTING, LIKE, BEERS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: SURE.
SHE'S A GREAT MOTHER. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE IS ACTUALLY, SHE'S THE BEST MOTHER. BUT SHE'D GET, LIKE, A 12 PACK OF BEER AND SHE'D JUST, LIKE, SIT ME ON THE TOP OF THE BOX OF BEER ON THE WAY DOWN.
Jimmy: YEAH. WELL, THAT'S --
THIS 2-YEAR-OLD CHILD ON TOP OF, LIKE, A BOX OF ALCOHOL.
Jimmy: YEAH, I'VE TAKEN THAT RIDE A COUPLE TIMES, MYSELF. YEAH. AND THEN YOU'RE MOVING BACK TO THE CITY FOR A LITTLE BIT,L BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO DO "THE CRUCIBLE" ON BROADWAY.
YES.
Jimmy: I MEAN, THIS IS MAJOR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: I CAN'T WAIT TO GO SEE YOU.
IT'S IN, YEAH, I'M STARTING IN JANUARY AND I'M TERRIFIED BECAUSE I'VE NEVER, I'VE NEVER DONE THEATRE.
Jimmy: I WON'T TELL YOU WHEN I'M COMING. BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE KNOWING WHEN PEOPLE --
I DON'T, I DON'T WANT TO GET THE JITTERS.
Jimmy: SO, I LOVE YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU DO. I JUST WATCHED "BROOKLYN" AND GOSH, YOU'RE FANTASTIC IN THIS, IN THIS MOVIE.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST, I THINK EVERYONE WILL ENJOY IT. IT'S LIKE THIS, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S THIS, IT'S THIS STORY ABOUT THIS, COMING OF AGE MOVIES, THAT ALWAYS GET ME.
YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT'S EVERYONE ALWAYS KIND OF SAYS THIS WHENEVER THEY'RE PLUGGING A FILM, THAT IT'S VERY UNIVERSAL, AND ANYONE CAN TAP INTO IT. BUT IN THIS CASE, LITERALLY, YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY IN AMERICA, I THINK EVERYONE'S AN IMMIGRANT. EVERYONE COMES FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.
Jimmy: SURE.
I'M AN IMMIGRANT. YOU ARE. EVERYONE ELSE HERE IS. I THINK BECAUSE OF THAT, AND BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY ABOUT THIS LIFE, AND HOW THIS WOMAN REALLY COMES INTO HER OWN, ONCE SHE OVERCOMES HOMESICKNESS, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL GO THROUGH.
Jimmy: IT'S A TOUGH THING.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE EXPERIENCES, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH. AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WENT OUT TO, I WENT OUT TO LOS ANGELES TO TRY TO BE A COMEDIAN, YOU KNOW, TO --
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHEN I WAS LEAVING, I WAS LIKE, AM I MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION? WHO KNOWS, YOU DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST SO --
IT'S SO SUNNY OUT THERE.
Jimmy: REALLY, YEAH. IT'S SO SUNNY, YEAH.
SO MUCH SUN OUT THERE.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET ONCE YOU'RE THERE, WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE OF YOURSELF. AND IT'S --
I KNOW.
Jimmy: OH, I JUST LOVED IT. AND THEN YOU MEET THIS REALLY GOOD ITALIAN GUY IN BROOKLYN. HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
TONY, YEAH.
TONY, YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE FANTASTIC.
NO HANDS.
Jimmy: OH, I LOVE IT.
OH, I LOVE IT.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY, IT'S CUTE. AND THEN YOU GO HOME, BACK TO IRELAND FOR A LITTLE BREAK THERE, BECAUSE SOME THINGS HAPPENED. AND THEN I DON'T WANT TO RUIN, BUT THE LAST SCENE WAS JUST FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: BUT I WANT TO SHOW A A CLIP HERE. HERE'S SAOIRSE RONAN IN THE FILM "BROOKLYN." CHECK IT OUT.
