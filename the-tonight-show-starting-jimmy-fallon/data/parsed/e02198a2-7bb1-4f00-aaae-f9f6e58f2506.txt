[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE SHOW. YOU'VE MADE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. TONIGHT WAS THE BIG DEMOCRATIC DEBATE BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS. THEY DISCUSSED IMPORTANT ISSUES SUCH AS NATIONAL SECURITY, THE ECONOMY, AND WHOSE SUPPORTERS ARE THE MOST ANNOYING ON FACEBOOK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THE BERNIE BROS. LAST NIGHT, DID YOU SEE? OVER 27,000 PEOPLE ATTENDED A A MASSIVE RALLY FOR BERNIE SANDERS IN MANHATTAN'S WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK. WELL TECHNICALLY, 7,000 PEOPLE SHOWED UP FOR BERNIE, WHILE 20,000 NEW YORKERS JUST SAW A A LINE AND GOT IN IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IS THIS FOR "HAMILTON?" IS THIS FOR "HAMILTON?" I LOVE "HAMILTON." AFTER DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY PROCESS IS UNFAIR, THE RNC CHAIRMAN RESPONDED THAT TRUMP SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE RULES A YEAR AGO. IN TRUMP'S DEFENSE, HE DIDN'T EXPECT ANYONE WOULD FALL FOR THIS A YEAR AGO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO I MEAN, THAT'S -- NO WAY -- LISTEN TO THIS, PRODUCERS FOR "GAME OF THRONES" CONFIRMED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS REQUESTED AND WILL RECEIVE EPISODES OF THE SHOW'S NEW SEASON BEFORE IT AIRS ON HBO.

IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN SAYS THAT SHE EATS AVOCADO PUDDING FOR BREAKFAST. THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW THE KARDASHIANS ARE OUT OF TOUCH WHEN THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE WORD FOR GUACAMOLE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AVOCADO PUDDING. THIS IS SPICY. THESE FRENCH FRIES NEED SOME TOMATO PUDDING. [ LAUGHTER ] KETCHUP? KETCHUP? [ LAUGHTER ] AVOCADO PUDDING. THIS MADE ME LAUGH HERE.

I'M REALLY GLAD NOT TO BE ON FACETIME RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: QUESTION ONE, HOW DID YOU WIN ALL THE DELEGATES IN COLORADO WITHOUT ANYONE EVEN VOTING?
WELL, DONALD, LAST YEAR, THE COLORADO STATE GOP, THEY VOTED TO CANCEL THEIR STATEWIDE PRIMARY AND INSTEAD TO HOLD DISTRICT CONVENTIONS TO ELECT THEIR 34 DELEGATES. WE'VE KNOWN THIS ALL ALONG, AND I WON THOSE ELECTIONS FAIR AND SQUARE.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK THE PEOPLE OF COLORADO DID VOTE, BUT THEY WERE SO HIGH, THEY COMPLETELY FORGOT. AND LET'S FACE IT, ANYONE THAT HIGH DEFINITELY VOTED FOR ME. SO BASICALLY, I WON COLORADO. OKAY, HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION JIMMY MIGHT ASK. WHAT IS YOUR STANCE ON IMMIGRATION?
WELL, DONALD, FIRST OF ALL, WE NEED TO PUT AN END TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S AMNESTY.
Jimmy: WALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND I BELIEVE WE NEED TO SECURE THE BORDER ONCE AND FOR ALL.
Jimmy: ONCE AND FOR WALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND START ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW.
Jimmy: LAW SPELLED BACKWARDS IS WALL! HUGE! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT QUESTION, THE NEW YORK PRIMARY IS ON TUESDAY. YOU'VE ALREADY WON YOUR HOME STATE OF CANADA. NOW -- [ LAUGHTER ] NOW YOU'RE IN MY HOME STATE OF NEW YORK CITY. AND PEOPLE ARE STILL MAD. THEY'RE MAD AT YOU FOR SAYING THEY HAVE "NEW YORK VALUES." WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?
LOOK, DONALD, I'M NOT GOING TO PANDER TO NEW YORKERS. I LOVE NEW YORK CITY. IT IS THE GREATEST CITY IN THE WORLD. WITH THE BEST-LOOKING AUDIENCES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO WHEN I SAID NEW YORK VALUES, I WAS MERELY TRYING TO SAY THAT I VALUE NEW YORK. EXCEPT, I WAS SAYING IT BACKWARDS, THE WAY YODA WOULD SAY IT. [ LAUGHTER ]

WELL, AND THEY LOVE WINING ALMOST AS MUCH AS YOU DO, DONALD.

Jimmy: TED? TED, DID YOU GET YOUR PEN YET? TED? TED, DID YOU GET YOUR PEN?
GOT IT.
Jimmy: LAST QUESTION, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE THE GOP NOMINEE?
WELL, LISTEN, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, WE'VE RUN A POSITIVE CAMPAIGN. AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S TAKEN A A WHILE, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE UNIFIED THE GOP.
Jimmy: SO HAVE I, IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT I UNIFIED THEM AGAINST ME. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I STILL UNIFIED THEM. THAT COUNTS, OKAY?
ALL RIGHT, DONALD, MY INTERVIEW WITH JIMMY FALLON IS ABOUT TO START.
Jimmy: ARE YOU GOING TO DO A A LIP-SYNC BATTLE?
I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT. [ LAUGHTER ]

THE BEST FOOD -- LISTEN, ACTUALLY THE BEEF SANDWICH I HAD TODAY AT CHARLIE'S BUTCHER SHOP IF YOU'RE IN BUFFALO, GO VISIT CHARLIE, IT'S AWFULLY GOOD. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. I'LL DO THAT. IS IT TOUGH ON THE FAMILY? 'CAUSE I KNOW YOUR KIDS GO OUT WITH YOU AND YOUR WIFE.
IT'S HANDS DOWN THE HARDEST PART.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO, WE'VE GOT -- HEIDI IS ON THE ROAD NONSTOP. AND FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE CAMPAIGN OR SO, THE GIRLS, MOSTLY STAYED HOME AND WERE IN SCHOOL. AND --
Jimmy: SO CUTE. YOUR GIRLS ARE --
THANKFULLY THEY LOOK LIKE THEIR MOTHER. I'M VERY GRATEFUL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY'RE REALLY CUTE. I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IT WAS, BUT MAYBE THE OLDER ONE, YOU WENT TO GIVE HER A KISS AND SHE GOES, "DAD!" [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT WOULD BE CAROLINE.
Jimmy: CAROLINE, YEAH.
BUT TODAY IS CAROLINE'S EIGHTH BIRTHDAY, SO I WANT TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CAROLINE! HAPPY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! HAVE A GREAT ONE.
AND YOU'VE GOT TWO LITTLE GIRLS, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH FUN IT IS.
Jimmy: THEY'RE TINY, THEY'RE THREE AND TWO.
JUST GET READY.
Jimmy: REALLY? YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
NO, IT'S -- AS THEY GET OLDER YOU'RE MORE AND MORE WRAPPED AROUND THEIR FINGERS, THEY DISCOVER -- I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS IN YOUR HOUSE, BUT IN OUR HOUSE, HEIDI IS THE TOUGH ONE AND DADDY'S THE PUSHOVER. DADDY'S THE ONE THEY COME TO WHEN MOMMY'S SAYING NO.
Jimmy: OH, COMPLETELY, OH YEAH. THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS ALREADY. BUT THEY'RE BABIES TOO, SO --
IT DOESN'T CHANGE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? NO, NOT AT ALL.
WELL, LOOK, OURS ARE FIVE AND EIGHT SO THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY DRIVING YET. BUT --
Jimmy: SOON, YEAH. SO WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN NOW? 'CAUSE NOW THE NEW YORK PRIMARY IS NEXT TUESDAY.
UH-HUH.
Jimmy: NOT LOOKING SO GOOD FOR YOU, RIGHT? SORRY TO BRING IT UP, BUT --
THANK YOU FOR RUBBING MY NOSE IN IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO.
LOOK, ACTUALLY THE EARLY POLLING WAS CHALLENGING, BUT I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT AS A A RESULT OF TONIGHT THAT WE'RE GONNA WIN NEW YORK WITH 100% OF THE VOTES. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE ATTITUDE, THAT'S THE ATTITUDE YOU GOTTA HAVE. SO NEW YORK IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEN WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN THOUGH? BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, I'M READING EVERYTHING I CAN. I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND DELEGATES AND WHAT HAS TO WORK AND THERE'S A MAGIC NUMBER. YOU AND TRUMP MIGHT NOT -- NEITHER OF YOU MIGHT NOT HIT THE NUMBER, THEN WHAT HAPPENS?
SO LISTEN, NEW YORK IS TRUMP'S HOME STATE. HE'S PROBABLY GONNA DO WELL HERE. A LOT PEOPLE EXPECT HIM TO GET NORTH OF 50%. WE'RE CAMPAIGNING HARD AND TRYING TO WORK TO EARN DELEGATES, AND I THINK WE'LL DO THAT AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS HERE, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WE ARE HEADED TO A CONTESTED CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND. WHERE I'M GONNA COME IN WITH A A BUNCH OF DELEGATES, DONALD'S GONNA COME IN WITH A BUNCH OF DELEGATES, NEITHER ONE OF US WILL HAVE GOTTEN THE MAJORITY. AND THEN IT'S GONNA BE A BATTLE TO SEE WHO CAN EARN A MAJORITY FROM THE DELEGATES WHO ARE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE. AND JIMMY, IF THAT HAPPENS, I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE IN THE MUCH STRONGER POSITION, I THINK DONALD'S HIGHEST TOTAL WILL BE ON THE FIRST BALLOT. AND WE WILL NATURALLY, YOU KNOW ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS WHERE DO THE RUBIO DELEGATES AND THE KASICH DELEGATES GO? AND I THINK THEY NATURALLY COME TO US. AND I THINK WE'LL WIN A A MAJORITY AT THE CONVENTION AND THEN WE'LL GO ON AND BEAT HILLARY IN NOVEMBER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IF IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUMP, DO YOU, 'CAUSE EVERYONE'S ASKING THIS QUESTION, WILL YOU SUPPORT THE NOMINEE?
WELL I AM WORKING VERY, VERY HARD -- [ LAUGHTER ] NOT TO HAVE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
Jimmy: HE'S A MASTER DEBATER, YOU GUYS. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. BUT YOU -- YOU DO, RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO? [ LAUGHTER ]
I AGREE, I HAVE TO BEAT HIM IN CLEVELAND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY. WHAT IF --
AND LISTEN, PART OF THE REASON WHY IS POLL AFTER POLL AFTER POLL SHOWS IF DONALD IS THE NOMINEE, HILLARY WINS AND SHE WINS BY DOUBLE DIGITS. [ CHEERS ]
OKAY. SO, IF YOU'RE A HILLARY SUPPORTER, YOU'RE ROOTING FOR DONALD. BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE'RE SAYING REALLY REPUBLICANS COMING TOGETHER BEHIND OUR CAMPAIGN, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO FORFEIT THE WHITE HOUSE AND HAND OVER ANOTHER FOUR OR EIGHT MORE YEARS OF AN ECONOMIC AGENDA THAT PEOPLE ARE HURTING. WE'VE GOT THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WORKING SINCE 1977. MY CAMPAIGN IS FOCUSED ON BRINGING JOBS BACK TO AMERICA, RAISING WAGES, BRINGING MANUFACTURING BACK FROM CHINA, BACK FROM MEXICO. EXPANDING SO YOUNG PEOPLE COMING OUT OF SCHOOL ACTUALLY HAVE JOBS, HAVE A FUTURE, THAT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION'S ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE DOING ISN'T WORKING AND I THINK WE HAVE TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. AND THAT'S A LOT OF THE REASON SO MANY REPUBLICANS ARE UNITING BEHIND OUR CAMPAIGN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WELL, I WISH YOU ALL THE LUCK. AND I THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
THANK YOU, JIMMY.
