OH, YEAH. SINCE I WAS REALLY YOUNG.
Jimmy: REALLY?
APPARENTLY MY FATHER TOLD ME THAT I WOULD PUT ON SHOWS AT FAMILY DINNERS. I WOULD SAY, "NO, LISTEN, THERE'S A SHOW GOING ON, THERE'S A SHOW HAPPENING." AND ME AND MY BRO WOULD TRY TO PRETEND TO SING.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT. ME AND MY SISTER WOULD DO THAT TOO. DO YOU HAVE -- HOW MANY BROTHERS AND SISTERS DO YOU HAVE?
I'M -- I HAVE TWO BROTHERS, I'M THE MIDDLE CHILD.
Jimmy: MIDDLE CHILD. YEAH. HERE'S YOU AND YOUR BROTHER THERE.
