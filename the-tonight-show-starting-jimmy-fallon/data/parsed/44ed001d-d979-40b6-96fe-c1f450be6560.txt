TOM BRADY.
TOM BRADY.
BALLS, BALLS.
DEFLATED BALLS.
TO ME THOSE BALLS ARE PERFECT.
Jimmy: ACTUALLY SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD. CAN WE GIVE THOSE BALLS A BEAT? ♪ BRADY BRADY BALLS BALLS BALLS BRADY BRADY BALLS INFLATED BALLS DEFLATED BALLS ♪ ♪ NERF BALLS KICK BALLS KUSH BALLS LOOSE BALLS ♪ ♪ HOT BALLS HARD BALLS SMALL BALLS LARGE BALLS ♪ ♪ BLUE BALLS QUE BALLS QUE BALLS BLUE BALLS ♪ ♪ RUBBER BOWLING BOUNCY BOCCI CRAZY BALLS DEFLATED BALLS BALLS ♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S THE BIG STORY. IT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT TOM BRADY WILL BE SUSPENDED FOR THE SEASONS FIRST FOUR GAMES FOR HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN THE DEFLATE-GATE SCANDAL. SO THE NFL SAYS HIS PUNISHMENT COULD BE REDUCED IF HE COMMITS AN ACTUAL CRIME. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S NICE. YEP, BRADY WAS SUSPENDED. HE SAYS THAT HE PROBABLY WILL BE APPEALING. BUT, THEN AGAIN WHEN IS TOM BRADY NOT APPEALING. AM I RIGHT LADIES? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS ] ♪♪
Steve: BALLS.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S GET TO SOME POLITICAL NEWS HERE. I READ THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS NOT ANSWERED ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEDIA IN 20 STRAIGHT DAYS. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WHILE ONE POTENTIAL OPPONENT CARLY FIORINA HAS DONE 30 INTERVIEWS IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS. THEN FIORINA SAID, "WHILE IT'S DEFINITELY NOT BECAUSE I'M HILLARY IN A WIG RUNNING AGAINST MYSELF SO EITHER WAY I WIN, THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A CRAZY IDEA. GOT TO GO. BYE ME. SPEAKING OF THE ELECTION MANY BELIEVE THAT JEB BUSH'S STRATEGY TO DELAY HIS CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCEMENT IS ACTUALLY HURTING HIS CHANCES OF BECOMING PRESIDENT. WHEN ASKED IF THE DELAY WAS AFFECTING HIM BUSH WAS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT MIGHT BE. [ LAUGHTER ] ANOTHER G.O.P. CANDIDATE, MIKE HUCKABEE IS DEFENDING HIMSELF FOR APPEARING ON INFOMERCIALS THAT PUSH QUESTIONABLE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. PEOPLE WERE LIKE, "AS WHAT THE BEFORE GUY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" [ APPLAUSE ] HUCKABEE DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM THE INFOMERCIALS HE'S APPEARED IN SAYING, "I DON'T HAVE TO DEFEND EVERYTHING THAT I'VE EVER DONE." IN A RELATED STORY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS, YEAH, YOU ACTUALLY DO HAVE TO DEFEND EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS PRETTY COOL. I READ THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BECOME ONLY THE FOURTH PRESIDENT IN HISTORY TO VISIT ALL 50 STATES AFTER HE RECENTLY TRAVELLED TO SOUTH DAKOTA. I THINK WE HAVE SOME FOOTAGE OF HIS TRIP TO SOUTH DAKOTA DON'T WE? THERE HE GOES. THAT COUNTS. THAT COUNTS. FOOT ON THE SOIL. IT COUNTS. HE DID IT. SOME PRETTY BIG TV NEWS HERE, FOX ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT THE UPCOMING 15th SEASON OF "AMERICAN IDOL" WILL BE THE SHOWS LAST. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR THE SHOWS ALUMNI, IN FACT I HEARD SIMON COWELL ACTUALLY LOWERED HIS NIPPLES TO HALF MAST. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S NICE. BEAUTIFUL. SOME BUSINESS NEWS I READ THAT VERIZON ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS ACQUIRING AOL FOR $4.4 BILLION. THIS OBVIOUSLY A BIG DEAL. VERIZON SAID, "THIS ACQUISITION SUPPORTS OUR STRATEGY TO PROVIDE A PREMIUM CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE." WHILE AOL HAD THIS TOO SAY. [ DIAL UP INTERNET NOISE ] "WE ARE HAPPY TO BE PARTNERING WITH VERIZON. THE WORLD HAS GONE MOBILE." [ DIAL UP INTERNET NOISE ]
WELCOME.
Jimmy: BEST OF LUCK TO THOSE TWO COMPANIES AS THEM MOVE FORWARD. YOU ALL KNOW THE ROYAL FAMILY IS IN THE NEWS A LOT LATELY BECAUSE OF THE ROYAL BABY. NOW THAT PRINCE WILLIAM AND KATE MIDDLETON HAVE HAD THEIR SECOND CHILD, IT SOUNDS LIKE PRINCE HARRY IS THINKING ABOUT SETTLING DOWN HIMSELF. WATCH THIS.
OF COURSE, I'D LOVE TO HAVE KIDS RIGHT NOW BUT THERE'S A A PROCESS THAT ONE HAS TO GO THROUGH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOTHING LIKE A GUY WITH RED HAIR TRYING TO EXPLAIN SEX. WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO GO -- THERE'S A BIRD AND EH, WELL, EH, OF COURSE A GEEZER. AND A STORK OR SOME BIRD WILL FLY, CARRYING A BABY AND EH. A STORK CAN'T CARRY THE WHOLE BABY. WELL IT'S A VERY LIGHTWEIGHT BABY AND A VERY BIG STORK. WELL THIS IS CRAZY. I SAW THAT ACROSS THE STREET, PICASSO'S WOMEN OF ALGIERS JUST BECAME THE MOST EXPENSIVE PAINTING TO SELL AT AUCTION AFTER GOING FOR $179.3 MILLION AT CHRISTIES RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS PAINTING? TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. YEAH, WHEN ASKED WHY HE PAID $179.3 MILLION FOR THE PAINTING, THE MAN WHO BOUGHT IT SAID, "BOOBS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WHY ELSE?
Jimmy: THERE IT IS. BOOBS, THERE IT IS.
Steve: BOOBS.
Jimmy: BOOBS, THERE IT IS.
Steve: I PUT ON DVD I WATCH IT ALL DAY LONG ON IN THE BOOB TUBE.
Jimmy: DVD BABY. YOU GUYS SEE THIS? STARBUCKS ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS NOW SELLING A MINI VERSION OF ITS FRAPPUCHINO, WHICH HOLDS TWO OUNCES LESS THAN THE SMALL SIZE. TOM BRADY TRIED ONE AND SWEARS NOTHING IS DIFFERENT. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN'T EVEN NOTICE IT. [ APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, OLIVE GARDEN, YOU KNOW WE LOVE OLIVE GARDEN. THEY JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL START USING ITS BREAD STICKS TO MAKE CHICKEN PARM AND MEAT BALL SANDWICHES. ITS PRETTY COOL. IN FACT, THE RESTAURANT EVEN RELEASED AN AD TO CLEAR UP A A FEW THINGS ABOUT THE NEW MENU ITEMS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
HERE AT OLIVE GARDEN YOU CAN NOW GET OUR SIGNATURE BREAD STICKS AS THE BREAD TO OUR DELICIOUS SANDWICHES. BUT YOU'LL ALSO CONTINUE TO GET UNLIMITED BREAD STICKS IN ADDITION TO THE BREADSTICKS SANDWICH. THEN TRY OUR NEW NEVER ENDING BREADSTICK EVEN AFTER YOU LEAVE THE RESTAURANT DEAL. WE'LL MAKE SURE EVERYONE GOES HOME WITH AN OLD SHOPPING CART FULL OF ALL THE PIPING HOT BREAD STICKS YOU CAN FIT IN YOUR CAR. AND WITH OUR NEW-NEW ALL YOU'LL EVER EAT AGAIN IS BREADSTICKS DEAL WE'LL SEND A TRAINED OLIVE GARDEN BAKER TO BREAK INTO YOUR HOUSE AND PREPARE BATCH AFTER BATCH OF WARM TOASTY BREADSTICKS.

Jimmy: YOU VERSUS JOHN KRASINSKI.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY.

Jimmy: LIP SYNC AND LEAVE.
YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE LIP SYNC AND HAVE IT BE STUPID. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT IT WAS LIKE SO BLOWN OUT AND SO EXCITING. SO, I WAS SO NERVOUS ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: YOU HAD BACK UP DANCERS?
SO I DECIDED TO DO, YOU KNOW, "BOOTY" BECAUSE I THOUGHT, THAT'S FUNNY. I DON'T HAVE A BOOTY. THAT'LL BE FUNNY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND PRODUCERS WERE LIKE, "IF YOU WANT TO DO 'BOOTY' WE CAN GET J.LO TO COME AND DO A A CAMEO." AND I WAS LIKE, YEAH. I MEAN, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. OH, OKAY. TWIST MY ARM.
Jimmy: THAT WASN'T ON MY LIST. PYROTECHNICS, J.LO, ALL THAT STUFF, BACKUP DANCERS.
SO, I YOU KNOW, LEARNED SOME CHOROGRAPHY. AND THE IDEA WAS JUST LIKE, I'M GOING TO DO SOME CHOREOGRAPHY AND THE BACKUP DANCERS. AND THEN SHE COMES OUT AND JUST STANDS IN A WIND MACHINE AND LOOKS GREAT. AND LIKE, NO ONE CARES ABOUT ME SO THE PRESSURE'S OFF. AND I'M JUST DOING THE RAP SECTION AND LIKE EVERYBODY'S JUST EXCITED THAT J.LO'S THERE. SO, I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE SECOND HALF OF THE SONG.
Jimmy: SURE, SHE CAN FINISH IT OFF.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: IT'S HER SONG. HELLO, YOU WROTE IT, YOU DO IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
SO, I WAS GETTING CHANGED FOR MY SECOND NUMBER AND I WAS LIKE DOING THE FULL LIKE, JENNY FROM THE BLOCK. YOU KNOW I HAD LIKE WITH MY WEAVE AND MY SLUTTY JUMPSUIT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE THING. AND THEY WERE LIKE, "SO, JENNIFER WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. SHE JUST WANTS TO COME OUT AT THE END OF THE SONG AND JUST LIKE WAVE HI." AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT? BUT, WHY?
Jimmy: WHY, WHEN SHE COULD DO THE WHOLE SONG?
AND I WAS LIKE TRYING TO CONVINCE HER, LIKE, BUT, I'M GOING TO LOOK SO STUPID. THEY'D REALLY JUST WANT TO SEE YOU. BUT, SHE'S J.LO. SHE CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL SHE WANTS.
Jimmy: I MEAN, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] EXACTLY.
SO, I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A A POINT IN THE SONG WHERE I'M NOT SURE IF SHE'S JUST GOING TO COME OUT AND TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF. BECAUSE THEN I'M JUST LIKE, I GUESS I'M JUST GOING TO DO THE RAP AND LIKE DO SOME STUFF LIKE THIS. I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, MOVE AROUND.
Jimmy: THERE'S NO CHOREOGRAPHY THERE.
NO. AND AT THIS POINT, I'M JUST LIKE, I JUST KEEP THROWING LOOKS OVER TO KRASINSKI LIKE HOW DID YOU CONVINCE ME TO COME ON THIS SHOW, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE COMES OUT AT THE END AND THE CROWD JUST GOES BONKERS.
Jimmy: OH YEAH.
SO, IT ALL WORKED OUT. IT WAS ALL GREAT. BUT, THEN I DID REALIZE, LIKE WHY AM I SINGING A SONG ABOUT BOOTY WITH JENNIFER LOPEZ'S BOOTY ON THE SAME STAGE. THAT WAS A BAD DECISION ON MY PART. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LET ALONE JOHN KRASINSKI'S BOOTY, AS WELL.
OH YEAH.
Jimmy: I MEAN HE'S THE ONE THAT'S GOT -- YEAH, THAT'S WHO I WOULDN'T MESS WITH.

IT'S SO COOL, IT WARMS MY LITTLE --
Jimmy: "BECA EFFIN MITCHELL?"
BECCA EFFIN MITCHELL, YEAH. AND, I FEEL LIKE IT'S THAT SCENE IN "THE GRINCH" WHERE MY HEART GROWS LIKE TWO SIZES. IT'S JUST SO SWEET. BUT, I WAS TALKING TO MY MOM ON MOTHER'S DAY AND WE WERE HAVING A REALLY SWEET, KIND OF, MOTHER-DAUGHTER CONVERSATION. AND I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF FOR GOING LIKE A A REALLY LONG TIME IN THIS CONVERSATION WITHOUT MAKING A A SARCASTIC COMMENT AND BEING KIND OF A JERK.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S OUR JOB AS CHILDREN.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, YEAH.
I KNOW! AND AT SOME POINT, SHE WAS LIKE, "ANNA, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I REALLY AM SO PROUD OF YOU. AND I'VE BEEN CHECKING OUT THIS 'POUND BECA EFFIN MITCHELL.'" AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU MEAN, HASHTAG BECA EFFIN MITCHELL?

THEY ARE ENORMOUS. I MEAN YOU EXPECT FOOTBALL PLAYERS TO BE, BUT IT WAS TERRIFYING BEING NEXT TO THEM.
Jimmy: WELL, ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO YOU. I MEAN YOU'RE SO TINY.
