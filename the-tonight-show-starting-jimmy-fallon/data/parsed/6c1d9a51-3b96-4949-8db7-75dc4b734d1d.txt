OF COURSE IT'S THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE TED CRUZ CAMPAIGN, OFFICIALLY NAMING CARLY FIORINA AS HIS RUNNING MATE. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY POPULAR. THEY'VE ALREADY RUN INTO A A LITTLE TROUBLE, BECAUSE APPARENTLY, THE TED CRUZ CAMPAIGN FAILED TO BUY THE WEBSITE NAMED CRUZFIORINA.COM BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DID. YEAH, AND THEY BEGGED THE SITE'S OWNER TO LET THEM BUY IT, BUT HE JUST SAID -- [ AS TRUMP ] NOT HAPPENING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M NOT LETTING IT HAPPEN, OKAY? I WANT TO BUILD A FIREWALL AND MAKE THEM PAY FOR IT. AFTER APPEARING TOGETHER AS RUNNING MATES, TED CRUZ AND CARLY FIORINA EVEN STARTED RELEASING SOME OF THEIR CAMPAIGN SLOGANS. CHECK THIS OUT.

YOU WANTED TO TAKE SOMETHING OUT ON ME, A VENDETTA OF SOME KIND. CHOKE ME OUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PEOPLE WHO WEAR CAPES DON'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
HE SPENT TEENAGE YEARS IN THIS HOUSING PROJECT CALLED LAUDERDALE COURTS, ONE OF THE FIRST HOUSING PROJECTS EVER BUILT IN AMERICA. FDR PUT IT UP, I THINK. YOU CAN GO TO THE APARTMENT HE STAYED IN WHEN HE WAS A A TEENAGER AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO TO HIS BEDROOM.
Jimmy: WOW.
IT'S A LITTLE TINY ROOM, THE BED BARELY FITS INTO IT.
Jimmy: I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS.
THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT ON THIS BLEAK LANDSCAPE. YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE HIM SITTING ON HIS BED LOOKING OUT HIS WINDOW WONDERING WHAT THE HECK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM. BUT THE FUNNY THING IS THE WALLS OF THIS ROOM ARE COVERED WITH LIPSTICK KISSES. SO WOMEN GO THERE AND THEY KISS THE WALLS. AND I THOUGHT THAT HAD ONLY EVER HAPPENED TO ME.
