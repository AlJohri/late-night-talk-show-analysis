THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE HOT SHOW OF THE YEAR. COME ON. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, GUYS. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS THAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT TONIGHT'S BIG DEBATE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON. IT WAS THE FIRST CHANCE AMERICANS GOT TO SEE HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP DEBATE AT THE SAME TIME. BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT WAS THE FIRST CHANCE AMERICANS GOT TO MUTE BOTH OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST PRESS ONE BUTTON AND THAT'S IT. YOU DON'T HEAR THEM.
Steve: MUTE.
Jimmy: THE DEBATE WAS ACTUALLY SPLIT INTO SEVERAL THEMES. AMERICAS DIRECTION, AMERICAS PROSPERITY, AMERICAS SECURITY, AND THEN STRANGELY "AMERICAS NINJA WARRIOR."
Steve: WOW. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: GOOD LUCK GETTING OVER THAT WALL. VERY TALL WALL. TONIGHT'S DEBATE WAS SHOWN ON ALMOST EVERY CHANNEL, INCLUDING NBC, ABC, FOX, CBS, CNN, UNIVISION AND C-SPAN. WHEN HE HEARD HOW MANY TV CHANNELS HE'D BE ON AT ONCE DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY TRIED TO STAY HOME AND WATCH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE WAS LIKE, I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE POPULAR. THIS IS UNUSUAL. THERE ACTUALLY WEREN'T ANY COMMERCIALS DURING TONIGHT'S DEBATE, SO THEY ANNOUNCED ALL THE SPONSORS BEFORE IT STARTED.

TONIGHT'S DEBATE IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY JACK DANIELS, BUDWEISER, JOHNNIE WALKER, COORS, MILLER LITE, SAM ADAMS, GUINNESS, GREY GOOSE, TOILET WINE, MAD DOG 2020 AND FINALLY CANADA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: I'M SORRY, RULES ARE RULES. [ LAUGHTER ] LOT OF CELEBRITIES ARE SHARING THEIR VIEWS OF THE ELECTION. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH ROLLING STONE, BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN CALLED TRUMP A MORON. WHICH, IS WHY NOW TRUMP'S STARTING A RUMOR THAT SPRINGSTEEN WASN'T REALLY BORN IN THE USA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LET ME SEE YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE. THIS IS A CRAZY STORY. A MAN IN FLORIDA IS IN JAIL AFTER HE WAS SPOTTED RIDING A A MANATEE AND DARED COPS TO ARREST HIM. MAYBE JUST ME BUT IF YOU DARE COPS TO ARREST YOU, TRY TO BE ON A FASTER ANIMAL THAN A A MANATEE.

WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT THE SURVIVORS, WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE AND LIKE WHEN I READ THE SCRIPT, I WAS LIKE INCREDIBLE THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF HOW MANY LIVES WERE TOUCHED BY THIS INCIDENT, AND I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS FILM JUST PAYS TRIBUTE TO THEM.
Jimmy: YEAH, I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. [ APPLAUSE ] HERE IS GINA RODRIGUEZ IN "DEEPWATER HORIZON." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
THE WELL IS GOING OUT.
WHAT?
I TESTED, THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM ME. I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THE RIG IN PLACE.
ALL RIGHT.
MAGENTA. MAGENTA ALARM.
WARNING.
I JUST LOST FOUR THRUSTERS ON THE PORT SIDE. I ONLY HAVE FOUR LEFT.
