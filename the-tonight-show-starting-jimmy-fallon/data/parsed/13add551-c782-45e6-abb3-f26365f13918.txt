Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS. HI. HEY. HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT A PLEASURE. OH, MY GOSH. PENTATONIX RIGHT THERE, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU GUYS. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. I'LL SEE YOU. THAT'S -- THAT'S AMAZING RIGHT THERE. OH MY GOODNESS. TALENTED, TALENTED PEOPLE. HIGGINS, ARE YOU IN THE GROUP NOW?
Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT YOU JOINED --
Steve: IT'S SEPTATONIX.
Jimmy: SEPTA -- OH, YEAH. I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. YES. CONGRATULATIONS. GOSH, YOU GUYS ARE SO GOOD.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE, MAN. WOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVED THAT. THE MOST TALENTED. I LOVE THAT. HOW GREAT WAS THAT? WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE. PENTATONIX COMING OUT. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW. TOM HANKS IS ON THE SHOW TONIGHT! TOM HANKS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JESSICA CHASTAIN IN THE HOUSE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PENTATONIX. THAT'S THE SHOW YOU WANT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, MY GOSH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HERE'S WHAT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT. NOW THAT THE DUST HAS SETTLED ON THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE, IT LOOKS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO REMAIN THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER. AND OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE DONALD TRUMP IS STILL IN THE LEAD. AND NOW TRUMP IS SAYING THAT HE SHOULD BE GIVEN SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AS OPPOSED TO HIS CURRENT SECURITY, HAVING GARY BUSEY FOLLOW HIM AROUND WITH NUNCHUCKS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHATEVER BOSS. WHAT DO YOU NEED, BOSS? AND AFTER GETTING ONLY NINE MINUTES, NINE MINUTES TO SPEAK DURING THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE ON TUESDAY NIGHT, LINCOLN CHAFEE SEEMED EXCITED TO BE INTERVIEWED BY WOLF BLITZER YESTERDAY AND GET HIS MESSAGE OUT. HE EVEN TWEETED ABOUT IT. LOOK, HE PUT "GETTING READY TO TALK WITH WOLF BLITZER ON CNN." YEAH, HE WAS PRETTY PUMPED UP. HE'S LIKE HIKING HIS PANTS UP. GETTING READY TO GO. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S SEE HOW THE INTERVIEW WENT. LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
WHY ARE YOU DOING SO POORLY IN ALL OF THE POLLS? YOU'RE BASICALLY GETTING CLOSER TO 0% THAN YOU ARE EVEN 1%. WHY BOTHER RIGHT NOW, IF YOU HAVE LIMITED MONEY, LIMITED SUPPORT? WHY KEEP GOING? YOU'RE GOING TO WIND UP LOOKING SILLY IF YOU KEEP GOING ON LIKE THIS. YOU'VE RAISED MAYBE $30,000. YOU HAVE NO CHANCE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GIVE IT TO ME -- GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT, WOLF. WHAT ARE MY CHANCES HERE? [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T SUGAR COAT IT, PAL. CHAFEE TALKS LESS IN THAT INTERVIEW THAN HE DID IN THE DEBATE. HE WAS LIKE -- HE'S THE FIRST DEMOCRAT TO SAY, "CAN I JUST TALK TO FOX NEWS?" I MEAN THIS IS -- THIS IS INSANE. [ LAUGHTER ] POOR GUY. LISTEN TO THIS. STUDIES FOUND THAT ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SEARCHES DURING THE DEBATE WAS "IS BERNIE SANDERS JEWISH?" WHILE THE MOST POPULAR RESPONSE ON GOOGLE WAS, "COME ON." [ LAUGHTER ] GET THIS, GUYS. ANALYSTS ARE SAYING THAT JOE BIDEN WAS ACTUALLY THE BIGGEST LOSER IN THE DEBATE AND THAT HE MISSED HIS CHANCE TO ENTER THE RACE. YEAH, THEY SAID ENTERING NOW WOULD BE AWKWARD AND INAPPROPRIATE. OR AS BIDEN PUT IT, "THOSE ARE MY TWO MIDDLE NAMES." I'M IN. LET'S GO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHO WANTS THE FINGER GUN BEHIND THE POPE? HUH? WHO WANTS A BACK RUB, HUH? HOW ARE YOU DOING? WHOA, WHOA.
Steve: FINGER GUN.
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU KNOW A LOT OF CANDIDATES ARE TRYING TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO REACH YOUNGER VOTERS. SOMETIMES IT KIND OF BACKFIRES ON THEM IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. RAND PAUL LIVE-STREAMED THE ENTIRE DAY OF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, THE OTHER DAY, AND AFTER A WHILE, I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN REGRETTING IT. THIS IS REAL. WATCH. THIS IS FROM HIS STREAM.
THE THIRD QUESTION, MOST POPULAR QUESTION, FROM GOOGLE IS, "IS RAND PAUL STILL RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?" AND I DON'T KNOW. I WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS DUMBASS LIVE STREAMING IF I WEREN'T. [ LAUGHTER ] YES, I STILL AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. GET OVER IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT MEANS IT'S LIVE. THAT MEANS IT'S LIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN'T EDIT THAT. THIS IS A LIVE STREAM. OH. ALSO NOTHING SAYS YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT LIKE YELLING AT THE INTERNET FROM A A PARKING LOT OF A HOLIDAY INN. DOESN'T THAT FEEL GOOD? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "WOULDN'T DO THIS DUMBASS THING." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT THIS IS PRETTY NICE, ACTUALLY. THE PROFESSIONAL NETWORKING SITE, LINKEDIN, ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL START OFFERING ITS WORKERS UNLIMITED VACATION TIME STARTING NEXT MONTH. YEAH. WHICH IS IRONIC, BECAUSE HAVING UNLIMITED VACATION TIME IS WHAT LEADS MOST PEOPLE TO SIGN UP FOR LINKEDIN. [ LAUGHTER ] I NEED A JOB, DUDE. I WANT TO WORK. [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS A LITTLE SURPRISING, NEW RESEARCH SHOWS CHINA HAS A A BIGGER MIDDLE CLASS THAN AMERICA AND MORE PEOPLE IN CHINA ARE LIVING WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE AMERICAN DREAM. YOU KNOW THINGS ARE BAD WHEN EVEN THE AMERICAN DREAM IS MADE IN CHINA. WOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GUYS, WE'RE IN WEEK SIX OF THE NFL SEASON.

IT WAS A TRUE STORY FROM 1961. FRANCIS GARY POWERS, THE SPY, THE U2 PILOT THAT LANDED. AND WE HAD TO GET HIM BACK. AND I DID NOT KNOW THE STORY OF THE CRUSADING HEROIC INSURANCE LAWYER THAT I PLAY, JAMES DONOVAN.
Jimmy: AND YOU PLAY IT SO WELL. I KNOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE GREAT, BUT --
WELL, IT'S MY JOB, I'M A A PROFESSIONAL. YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I LEARN MY LINES. I GO TO WORK ON TIME.
Jimmy: IT'S ALL CONDENSED TO THE LITTLE DETAILS. THERE'S ONE, I MEAN, I JUST KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE KIND OF A A GEEK WHEN IT COMES TO THAT WORLD WAR II. YOU LOVE EVERY SINGLE THING. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE FREAKED OUT ABOUT? THE TYPING ON THE PIECE OF PAPER WHEN IT TELLS YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THE GOVERNMENT JOB.
YEAH, I STEAL TYPEWRITERS FROM THE SETS. I GO OVER AND TRY EVERY ONE. DOES THIS ONE WORK? DOES THIS ONE NOT WORK?
Jimmy: I KNOW YOU GEEK OUT. THEN THEY ALSO HAVE THAT ONE THING, GIVEN THE U.S. -- THE PILOT. FRANCES GETS, IT'S A COIN?
IT WAS A DOLLAR COIN THAT HAS A SPECIAL NEEDLE IN IT. PULLS IT OUT.

ELLEN LEWIS, YEAH.
Jimmy: FANTASTIC. EVERYONE --
BUNCH OF GUYS FROM "LUCKY GUY" WERE IN IT. I DID A PLAY ON BROADWAY. GOT MICHAEL GASTON AND JOE FORBICH, COUPLE -- SO, I WAS ABLE TO THROW SOME PALS INTO THE MIX WHICH WAS GREAT.

SCOTT SHEPHERD, GREAT ACTOR.
Jimmy: IT WAS JUST FUN. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP HERE. HERE'S TOM HANKS STARRING IN STEVEN SPIELBERG'S LATEST FILM, "BRIDGE OF SPIES" IN THEATERS TOMORROW. CHECK THIS OUT.
YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES THAT HE SPEND THE REST OF HIS DAYS IN A PRISON CELL. HOW IS THIS THE NATIONAL INTEREST?
NOT THE INCARCERATION, ITSELF, SIR. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, AN AMERICAN OF EQUIVALENT RANK MIGHT BE CAPTURED BY SOVIET RUSSIA. WE MIGHT WANT TO HAVE SOMEONE TO TRADE.
WOW. THAT SOUNDS LIKE SPINNING WHAT-IF. YOU COULD DO THAT UNTIL THE COWS COME HOME.
MY BUSINESS, WHAT-IFs. I'M IN INSURANCE. AND THERE'S NOTHING IMPLAUSIBLE ABOUT THIS ONE. ENTIRELY THE REALM OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN. IT'S THE KIND OF PROBABILITY THAT PEOPLE BUY INSURANCE FOR. IF WE SEND THIS GUY TO HIS DEATH, WE LEAVE OURSELVES WIDE OPEN. NO POLICY IN OUR BACK POCKET. FOR THE DAY THE STORM COMES.
NICE SPEECH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

NOT MY FAULT YOU FORGOT YOURS AT HOME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: KIND OF IS. YOU TOLD ME WE WOULDN'T NEED THEM TODAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
I WAS JOKING. WE ALWAYS NEED THEM. WE'RE SPIES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OBVIOUSLY, BUT WE'RE ALSO FRIENDS, SO I TRUSTED YOU. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
YOU SHOULD NEVER TRUST A A SPY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT ABOUT TRUSTING A A FRIEND SPY?
Steve: SPY ONE AND SPY TWO LOOK AT EACH OTHER. SPY ONE LOOKS AMAZED.
WOW. I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT LIKE THAT BEFORE. MAYBE FRIENDSHIP IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT SPYING.
Jimmy: EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
HERE, YOU CAN HAVE MY BINOCULARS. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Steve: SPY ONE HANDS OVER THE BINOCULARS TO SPY TWO.
Jimmy: HA, HA, YOU'RE SUCH A A LOSER. RULE NUMBER ONE OF BEING A SPY IS NEVER HAND OVER YOUR BINOCULARS. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU TRICKED ME! YOU'RE A GOOD SPY! AND I'M A BAD SPY!
Jimmy: YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M THE BEST AND YOU'RE THE WORST.
UH-OH. THE BAD GUYS ARE HERE. WE HAVE TO FIGHT THEM NOW!
Jimmy: BUT WE'RE BOTH TERRIBLE FIGHTERS.
WELL, QUICK, THROW THE BINOCULARS AT THEM!
Steve: SPY TWO THROWS THE BINOCULARS AT THE BAD GUY AND HITS HIM IN THE FACE. THE BAD GUY FALLS. SPY ONE PUTS HIS ARM AROUND SPY TWO.
WE DID IT. WE SAVED THE WORLD. LET'S GO GET LUNCH AND TALK ABOUT OUR FRIENDSHIP.
Steve: END SCENE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

Jimmy: HI, PAL.
HI.
Jimmy: SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.
THANKS.
Jimmy: I WAS CHECKING OUT MY COVER OF "W" MAGAZINE. I GUESS I SUBSCRIBE.
WWW.
Jimmy: WWW. AND I ALMOST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU HERE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU LOOK GORGEOUS. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW --
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU. YOU LOOK GORGEOUS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO. NOT WHAT I MEANT. YOU ALWAYS LOOK GORGEOUS.
Jimmy: ALTHOUGH BACKSTAGE, I WAS TALKING TO YOU. AND YOU SAID SOMEONE CONGRATULATED YOU ON "JURASSIC WORLD," WHICH IS GREAT, BUT YOU WERE NOT IN "JURASSIC WORLD."
NOPE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD.
THAT'S BRYCE, YEAH. YOU KNOW, THE BIGGEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR. FABULOUS. BUT, YEAH, THAT'S NOT ME. AND ALSO I HAVE THE SAME HAIRCUT SHE HAS IN THAT MOVIE NOW. I'M LIKE, "OH, GEEZ."
Jimmy: YOU'RE ASKING FOR IT. I FOLLOW YOU ON INSTAGRAM. YOU POSTED THIS PHOTO WHICH IS GREAT. PEOPLE STILL THINK WE'RE THE SAME PERSON. I KNOW, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH. ISN'T THAT GREAT? YOU GUYS, THIS IS NOT A NEW THING. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR A A LONG TIME.
WE DID "THE HELP" TOGETHER AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE LIKE, GRABBED EACH OTHER. WE'RE LIKE, "LET'S LOOK IN THE MIRROR." AND WE LOOKED AT OUR FACES SIDE BY SIDE. WE WERE LIKE, "OKAY, WE LOOK ALIKE." BUT IT DID HAPPEN TO ME WHERE I -- RIGHT AFTER I GOT OUT OF COLLEGE I WAS DOING OFF, OFF, OFF BROADWAY PLAY. I WAS SO EXCITED. IT WAS MY FIRST JOB. I WAS LIKE, "I'M A WORKING ACTRESS MAKING, LIKE, $200 A WEEK." I WAS LIKE, "YES! KILLING IT."
Jimmy: THAT'S IT, MAN.
AND "THE VILLAGE" HAD JUST COME OUT. THAT MOVIE THAT WAS HER BIG BREAK. I WAS ON THE SUBWAY. AND I SAW THESE KIDS LOOKING AT ME, THESE TEENAGERS. THEY COME OVER. THEY GO, "SORRY, ARE YOU AN ACTRESS?" I WAS, LIKE, "YES!"
Jimmy: BEING RECOGNIZED. OH, MY GOSH.
THIS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE IN MY FUTURE?
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEY WERE GOING ON AND ON. I WAS, LIKE, "OH, THANK YOU. IT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH." AND THEN THEY GO, "YES, 'THE VILLAGE.' IT WAS JUST SUCH A GREAT MOVIE." I HAD THIS MOMENT OF DO I TELL THEM?
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT THEY'RE WRONG? AND IT'S NOT ME, OR DO I JUST PRETEND I'M BRYCE? AND AS ONE DOES, I PRETENDED I WAS BRYCE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW GOOD OF AN ACTRESS YOU ARE. "YEAH, I'M BRYCE." THEN YOU'RE LIKE, "HEY BRYCE. I WAS REALLY NICE TO SOME FANS OF YOURS. YOU OWE ME ONE."
I SIGNED YOUR NAME A COUPLE TIMES.
Jimmy: I SIGN JIMMY KIMMEL EVERY OTHER WEEK. [ LAUGHTER ] IT DOESN'T MATTER AT THIS POINT. HE'S A NICE GUY. THIS MOVIE, IT'S SO FUN TO SEE. FRIENDS OF THE SHOW AND ACTORS ACT BECAUSE LOOKING AT HOW FRIENDLY AND HAPPY AND FUN YOU ARE. YET, YOU DO THESE, LIKE, CREEPY, SCARY MOVIES. I MEAN -- [ IMITATES CREEPY VOICE ] DON'T TO THAT. THAT SCARED ME. YOU SCARED ME IN THAT. NOW HERE YOU ARE IN ANOTHER, MORE LIKE A CREEPY MOVIE. THIS ONE IS, LIKE -- GUILLERMO del TORO.
TOTAL CREEPAZOID. "CRIMSON PEAK."
Jimmy: YES, "CRIMSON PEAK," THE NAME OF THE MOVIE. IT'S BEAUTIFULLY SHOT, BUT IT'S OUT THERE.
IT'S OUT THERE. IT'S A GOTHIC ROMANCE. IT HAS GHOSTS IN IT. IT'S A THRILLER. IT'S A DRAMA.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I TELL YOU, I HAVE THREE DVDs IN MY TRAILER WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THE PART. I HAD "REBECCA," "MISERY" AND "WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?"
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. THAT'S THE TRIFECTA RIGHT THERE. YEAH. THAT'S SOME CREEPY STUFF. I'M TELLING YOU, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET THAT -- HOW DO YOU SHAKE THAT FROM YOUR -- SEE, THAT'S WHY --

Jimmy: YOU SHOULD. OF COURSE.

Jimmy: LET'S DO IT. LET'S TAKE SIX MONTHS OFF OF "THE TONIGHT SHOW" AND DO A A COMEDY RIGHT NOW.
YOU DON'T MIND, RIGHT?
Jimmy: IT WILL BE GREAT. WE'LL CALL IT "WHA --" "WOMAN MAN?"
TAKE THE "W" AND REVERSE IT.
Jimmy: THE COVER, "M" WOULD BE FANTASTIC. I GOTTA WORK ON THAT ONE.
FOR "CRIMSON PEAK," IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY. I NORMALLY DON'T HAVE BIRTHDAY PARTIES BECAUSE I'M WORKING OR WHATEVER. AND I WAS SO DEPRESSED BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY DARK. YET, 12 OF MY FRIENDS FLEW TO TORONTO. AND WE HAD A THREE-DAY BIRTHDAY EXTRAVAGANZA.
Jimmy: PARTY IN TORONTO.

Jimmy: THERE'S SOME PLACES YOU CAN PARTY IN TORONTO.
YOU REALLY CAN. I MEAN, WE HAD A GOOD TIME. WE ENDED WITH KARAOKE.
Jimmy: GO SEE "CRIMSON PEAK" THIS WEEKEND, AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE DONE, GO TO KARAOKE TO SHAKE IT ALL OFF. YOU'LL GET CREEPED. YOU'LL SEE HOW TRIPPY IT IS. IT'S ALSO IN IMAX, WHICH BY THE WAY, WILL CREEP YOU OUT, DOUBLE WHAMMY. BUT IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR AND JUST CHECK IT OUT. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S JESSICA CHASTAIN IN "CRIMSON PEAK." CHECK IT OUT.

OF COURSE. FORGIVE ME. I'LL RUN YOU A HOT BATH. THE PIPES WILL RUN RED AT FIRST BECAUSE OF THE CLAY. SOON THE WATER WILL CLEAR.
OH, LUCILLE, WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT, WOULD YOU MIND GETTING ME A COPY OF THE HOUSE KEYS, PLEASE?
YOU DON'T NEED ONE.
I'M SORRY?
THAT PART OF THE HOUSE IS UNSAFE. IT WILL TAKE YOU A FEW DAYS TO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF, THEN SHOULD YOU STILL SAY YOU NEED THEM. I'LL HAVE COPIES MADE.
