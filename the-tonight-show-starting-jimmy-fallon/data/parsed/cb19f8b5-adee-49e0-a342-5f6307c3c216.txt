Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- PENELOPE CRUZ, JEFF DANIELS, MUSICAL GUEST DIERKS BENTLEY, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 480, PHOENIX! WOO!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: PLEASE, WELCOME. WELCOME. PLEASE, THANK YOU VERY, VERY, VERY MUCH. PLEASE, ENJOY YOURSELVES, PLEASE. WELCOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE NOW. YOU'RE HOME. YOU'RE HOME. YOU'RE SAFE. THANK YOU. WELCOME, EVERYONE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU ALL MADE IT AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. YOU GUYS, IT'S FINALLY STARTING TO FEEL LIKE SUMMER HERE IN NEW YORK CITY WITH TEMPERATURES ALL OF THE WAY UP IN THE 80s. [ CHEERS ] AND I'M PROUD TO SAY NEW YORKERS WAITED ALMOST 15 MINUTES BEFORE THEY STARTED COMPLAINING. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY GO, "THIS HEAT IS THE WORST! CAN'T WAIT FOR WINTER!" LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. AFTER HILLARY CLINTON DECLINED TO DEBATE BERNIE SANDERS THIS MONTH, THERE'S NOW TALK THAT BERNIE MIGHT DEBATE DONALD TRUMP. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: NO WORD ON WHAT THE DEBATE WILL BE ON, BUT I'M GUESSING MUTE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND AT A CAMPAIGN STOP IN NEW MEXICO YESTERDAY BILL CLINTON ARGUED WITH A A BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER FOR 30 MINUTES ABOUT ISSUES FROM THE '90s. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT GOT HEATED ESPECIALLY WHEN BILL TRIED TO CLAIM THAT "STEP BY STEP" WAS BETTER THAN "FAMILY MATTERS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS LIKE, "URKEL WAS OVERRATED."
Steve: STEFAN URQUELLE.
Jimmy: THIS IS EMBARRASSING. I READ THAT DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN ACCIDENTALLY SENT A A REPORTER AN EMAIL WITH DETAILS ABOUT HOW TRUMP WAS GOING TO ATTACK HILLARY CLINTON. OR AS TRUMP PUT IT, "WOW, ANOTHER HILLARY EMAIL SCANDAL. SAD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN HER SHOES." NOW THIS IS INTERESTING HERE. A NEW SURVEY ASKED AMERICANS WHICH CANDIDATE THEY'D WANT TO SIT NEXT TO ON A PLANE AND 37% CHOSE DONALD TRUMP. MEANWHILE, THE OTHER 63% MISSED THEIR FLIGHT WAITING IN THE TSA LINE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FIGURE THIS OUT! FIGURE THIS OUT! THEY ASKED PEOPLE WHICH CANDIDATE THEY'D WANT TO SIT NEXT TO ON A PLANE, DONALD TRUMP WAS THE NUMBER ONE CHOICE. WHEN TRUMP HEARD THAT, HE WAS LIKE, "WHAT DOES 'SIT NEXT TO SOMEONE ON A PLANE' MEAN? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DID THEIR PRIVATE JET BREAK, OR SOMETHING?" BERNIE SANDERS ASKED WHY PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO SIT NEXT WITH HIM, AND THEY SAID, "WELL WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN COACH." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "THE 1% IS GETTING ALL THE PRETZELS! [ LAUGHTER ] IT SHOULD BE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED. ONE BAG OF PRETZELS. EVERYONE GETS A PRETZEL! YOU GET A PRETZEL AND YOU GET A A PRETZEL!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EVERYONE GETS -- SPEAKING OF BERNIE SANDERS, I SAW THAT HE GAVE AN INTERVIEW ON "THE VIEW" THIS WEEK. OF COURSE, "THE VIEW" IS KNOWN FOR BEING A WELCOMING, WARM, INVITING TALK SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I THINK BERNIE EXPECTED IT TO BE AN EASY INTERVIEW. I'M NOT SURE HE GOT THAT. TAKE A LOOK.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS, ACCORDING TO EVERYTHING WE'RE HEARING AND SEEING, TO BECOME THE NOMINEE.
YOU CAN'T WIN THE NOMINATION RIGHT NOW WITH PLEDGE DELEGATES.
IF YOU LOSE THE NOMINATION, WHICH IS HIGHLY PROBABLE AT THIS POINT.
ARE YOU DOING MORE HARM TO THE PARTY THAN GOOD? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE FIRST TIME BERNIE FELT THE BERN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? [ APPLAUSE ] AND YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS, BUT FORMER NEW MEXICO GOVERNOR GARY JOHNSON IS RUNNING AS A A THIRD-PARTY LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE. AND HE'S ACTUALLY POLLING AROUND 10% AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP AND I THINK I KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO PAY ATTENTION TO HIM. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
OKAY, YOU WERE NAMED THE CEO OF A CANNABIS COMPANY, A A MARIJUANA COMPANY. IF YOU WERE EVER ELECTED WOULD YOU LEGALIZE MARIJUANA?
OH, IN A HEARTBEAT.
Jimmy: YEAH. OAKY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY QUESTION IS HOW IS HE ONLY PULLING A 10%? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THE GUY WANTS TO LEGALIZE WEED. WHICH I GUESS EXPLAINS HIS SLOGAN, "MAKE AMERICA LATE AGAIN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "SORRY, MAN. SORRY I'M LATE. YOU WANTED ME TO COME INTO WORK AT 9:00 A.M.? [ LAUGHTER ] NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN." I SAW PRESIDENT OBAMA ATTENDED A TOWN HALL IN VIETNAM THIS WEEK WHERE HE ENDED UP MEETING THE COUNTRY'S QUEEN OF HIP HOP, AND EVEN SHOWED OFF HIS BEAT BOXING SKILLS. YEAH. EITHER THAT OR OBAMA JUST GOT STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF A A SENTENCE. ♪ NOW LOOK UH UH UH UH ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ NOW LOOK UH UH UH UH UH NOW LOOK UH UH UH UH UH NOW LOOK ♪ ♪ UH SASHA MALIA SASHA MALIA SASHA MALIA ♪ ♪ MICHELLE'S IN THE GARDEN WITH THE BROCCOLI ♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "GIVE ME THE MIC. HAND ME THE MIC SO I CAN DROP IT! HAND ME THE MIC. I WANT TO DROP THE MIC." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: NOT YOU, MIKE.
Jimmy: OBAMA ALSO TOOK QUESTIONS FROM A CROWD IN VIETNAM YESTERDAY, AND THEY WERE CURIOUS ABOUT SOME THINGS FROM HIS PAST. LISTEN TO THIS GUY.
AS YOU SAID BEFORE, WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG YOU LOVED FOOLING AROUND, AND I READ ON INTERNET, I'M NOT SURE IF TRUE OR NOT, THAT YOU ALSO LIKE SMOKING WEED. YOU KNOW, THINGS LIKE THAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ ON THE INTERNET, THOUGH. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OR AS THAT ANSWER IS ALSO KNOWN. NOT A NO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
"DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ ON THE INTERNET."
Steve: "NEXT QUESTION."
Jimmy: "NEXT QUESTION. [ LAUGHTER ] HE CAN SIT DOWN NOW, GET HIM A A T-SHIRT OR SOMETHING." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT THE OBAMA FAMILY IS PLANNING TO MOVE INTO A NINE- BEDROOM MANSION IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AFTER THE PRESIDENT LEAVES OFFICE. YEAH. I GUESS HE WANTS TO BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO DRIVE BY THE WHITE HOUSE EVERY MORNING AND SHOUT, "SUCKS, DOESN'T IT? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SEE YOU TOMORROW! [ APPLAUSE ] OH, FEELS GREAT! [ HONKING NOISE ] YEAH, BABY!" [ APPLAUSE ] FINALLY, I SAW THAT DISNEY IS CONSIDERING MAKING A A LIVE-ACTION REMAKE OF "THE LITTLE MERMAID." [ CHEERS ] IT WON'T COME OUT FOR A WHILE, SO IF YOU WANT TO WATCH A WOMAN SWIM AROUND WITH CRABS, JUST WATCH "THE BACHELORETTE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GUYS, WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW!

Jimmy: YOU'RE WORKING YOUR BUTT OFF OVER THERE. I HAVE QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT'S SUMMERTIME AND EVERYONE IS EXCITED, RIGHT? FREAKING OUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THINKING ABOUT GRILLING AND GOING ON VACATION, AND I WAS THINKING, HAVE YOU PLANNED IT OUT YET. I WAS THINKING OF GOING ON AN RV VACATION.
OOH!
Jimmy: I THINK YOU KNOW A A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS.
I AM A PROFESSIONAL.
Jimmy: YOU ARE? THIS IS FANTASTIC.
YEAH, I'VE BEEN DRIVING RVs SINCE EARLY '90s.
Jimmy: I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE TO BEGIN OR WHERE TO START. DO I BUY ONE?
NO. NO. WELL, NOT YET. YOU RENT ONE FROM A LOCAL WHO CARES RV DEALER.
Jimmy: SO THERE'S AN RV DEALER. DO YOU MIND IF I WRITE IT DOWN?
YEAH, SURE. YOU DON'T NEED A LICENSE, A A SPECIAL LICENSE BECAUSE THAT WOULD GET IN THE WAY OF A SALE.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T CARE WHO IT IS?
THEY DON'T CARE, AND WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU IS THAT YOU WILL BE DRIVING A BUILDING.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S MY OTHER QUESTION. HOW BIG OF AN RV DO I GET?
Jimmy: IT'S THE BIGGEST THING YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN, IN YOUR LIFE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE BEHIND THE WHEEL BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE AND BEHIND YOU IS THE WORLD. I MEAN, IT'S LIKE DRIVING 30 ROCK. IT'S HUGE. IT'S HUGE.
Jimmy: DRIVING A BUILDING.
YEAH. AND THEY GIVE YOU -- THEY GO, GREAT, HERE'S THE THING AND HERE'S HOW TO WORK THE SHOWER AND THE FLIGHT OUT AND YOU'RE, LIKE, SPINNING. YOU DON'T HEAR ANY OF IT AND THEN THEY TOSS YOU THE KEYS AND SAY GOOD LUCK, CHIEF.
Jimmy: THEY WISH YOU LUCK.
YOU'RE DOWN THE ROAD GOING, WHOA, WHOA -- NOW, DRIVE WITH CONFIDENCE.
Jimmy: NOW, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
THAT MEANS WHEN YOU COME UP TO AN INTERSECTION, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A WIDE TURN.
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND MORE THAN LIKELY IN THE FIRST TRIP YOU'RE GOING TO HIT SOME THINGS, BUT THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S OKAY.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN THINGS?
WELL, SAY YOU'RE MAKING A A WIDE TURN.
Jimmy: OKAY, YEAH. YOU'RE GOING TO TURN RIGHT AND THERE IS THE PERSON WHO IS TURNING LEFT HERE AND IT'S A A HONDA CIVIC AND WAY DOWN THERE --
Jimmy: WHY IS IT A HONDA CIVIC?
I DON'T KNOW. AND THERE'S A GUY IN THE HONDA CIVIC.
Jimmy: THERE IS A HUMAN BEING IN THERE.
OH, YEAH, AND HE SEES WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO. HE SEES THAT JIMMY FALLON IS BEHIND THE WHEEL OF AN RV.
Jimmy: OH, NO!
HOW MUCH TIME AND TRAINING DOES JIMMY FALLON HAVE? NONE! ZERO! THE HONDA CIVIC GUY KNOWS.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT GOING TO END WELL. AND BECAUSE YOU'RE A BUILDING, YOU HAVE TO CUT IT AT THE LAST POSSIBLE SECOND. YOU HAVE TO GET IT SO YOU CUT IT WITHIN AN INCH OF HONDA CIVIC TO MAKE IT SO THE BACK END DOESN'T COME UP OVER THE CURVE.
Jimmy: AND PASS HIM AND GIVE HIM A LITTLE HONK.
AND TO SEE THE LOOK -- AND TO SEE THE LOOK ON THE HONDA CIVIC.
Jimmy: IT'S GODZILLA. OH, MY GOD! THE AIR BAGS ARE GOING TO GO.
AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT DOWN, NOW YOU PLAY WITH THEM AND NOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT AND YOU GO, LAST SECOND!
Jimmy: YEAH! OKAY. YEAH.
SO THAT'S GOOD.
NOW YOUR WIFE, SHE'LL BE GOING WITH?
Jimmy: YEAH. I'M NOT DOING THIS ALONE.
I'VE DONE IT ALONE. I'VE DONE IT WITH THE DOG.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE?
WITH THE DOG. SPECIAL TRIP. I GET EMOTIONAL TALKING ABOUT IT. BUT IF YOU GO WITH YOUR WIFE, TWO THINGS. TAKE A HEAD COUNT. WHEN YOU'RE LEAVING A GAS STATION OR TRUCK STOP.
Jimmy: YOU CANNOT FORGET YOUR WIFE. IS SHE OKAY RIGHT NOW?
SHE'S STILL WITH ME.
Jimmy: THANK GOODNESS. I HAD TO DOUBLE BACK TO GET HER. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A HEAD COUNT.
Jimmy: YOU FORGOT YOUR WIFE?
I FORGOT MY WIFE.
Jimmy: AT THE TRUCK STOP? OH, MY GOD.
AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE'D RENTED ONE. BE WARY BECAUSE YOU'RE GASSING UP, AND I WAS IMPATIENT, AND I GOT IN THE THING, AND MY KIDS WERE THIS BIG AND WE PULL OUT AND I'M GOING -- MERGING UP ON THE HIGHWAY AND MY SON SAYS DAD, WHERE'S MOM? AND YOU'RE THIS, YOU'RE 10 AND 2 DRIVING A BUILDING.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. WHEN I DO IT I'LL TAKE PICTURES.
I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU WORK THE SEWAGE. THE WHOLE SEWAGE DUMPING THING.
Jimmy: I'LL JUST HOLD IT FOR A WEEK. [ LAUGHTER ]
DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE THERE.
Jimmy: I WANT TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS, "BLACKBIRD," THIS PLAY IS VERY INTENSE AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE UNDERSTANDS REALLY HOW HARD YOU WORK, BUT, DOING THESE PLAYS IT'S GRUELING. THIS IS A VERY DRAMATIC PLAY, AND CONGRATULATIONS WITH THE TONY NOMINATIONS. BUT, HOW MANY DO YOU DO AND HOW MANY HAVE YOU DONE? A WEEK.
WE GO TO TONIGHT'S NUMBER 125.
Jimmy: HOW MANY HOURS? HOW LONG IS IT?
WELL, IT'S 90 MINUTES. BUT IT'S A BRUTAL 90 MINUTES AND THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT. IF YOU'RE AN ACTOR AND YOU WANT TO BE CHALLENGED THIS DOES THAT. IT'S A TOUGH, TOUGH DRAMA. MICHELLE WILLIAMS AND I, JUST THE TWO OF US AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT. AND THAT'S ALL IN. WHERE YOU LITERALLY JUST GUT YOURSELF EVERY NIGHT AND YOU GET NOMINATED FOR A TONY.
Jimmy: HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
AND IT'S GREAT. BUT WHEN YOU WORK THAT HARD AND YOU'RE LISTENING TO THAT AND READ OFF THE NAMES. I WAS LIKE I BETTER HEAR MY NAME.
Jimmy: I WORKED TOO HARD FOR THIS. YOU DESERVE IT BUDDY AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU THE RED CARPET THERE AND DOING POSES AND SAYING HI TO EVERYBODY.
POSING I CAN'T WAIT.
Jimmy: BUT, IT'S NOT YOU. YOU'RE SO MICHIGAN.
IT'S SO STUPID AND SO RIDICULOUS.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S STANDING THERE AND NOT JUST ACTRESSES, BUT ACTORS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
I'M GOING, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I GO BACK TO MICHIGAN AND GET A A DINER AND A CUP OF COFFEE AND I DO THAT.
Jimmy: MOVIE STAR HERE. I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU GOT NOMINATED AND THANK YOU FOR COMING TO VISIT US. YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT. YOU HAVE TWO AND A HALF WEEKS LEFT?
TWO AND A HALF MORE GOOD WEEKS.
