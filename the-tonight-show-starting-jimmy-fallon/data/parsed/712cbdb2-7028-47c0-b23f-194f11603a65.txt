MY PLEASURE.
Jimmy: BECAUSE I WANT -- I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU. I WANT TO KNOW -- CLEARLY YOU WON THE LAST DEBATE, BY FAR, AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. AND I THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO SEE YOU WIN THAT DEBATE WHEN YOU WEREN'T EVEN PART OF THE FIRST DEBATE REALLY. YOU WERE IN THE DIFFERENT SECTION OF THE FIRST DEBATES. HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
WE CALLED IT THE HAPPY HOUR DEBATES.
Jimmy: YEAH, WHAT -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
THE HAPPY HOUR DEBATES.
Jimmy: JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE SO MANY CANDIDATES, THEY HAD TO SPLIT IT UP.
WELL, I EARNED MY WAY ONTO THE BIG STAGE. HAPPY TO DO IT. YOU KNOW, WHEN I STARTED THIS RACE NOBODY KNEW WHO I WAS, HONESTLY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
MOST PEOPLE -- I DON'T KNOW, 90-PLUS PERCENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAD NEVER HEARD MY NAME, DIDN'T KNOW I WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. SO I HAD TO WORK REALLY HARD TO INTRODUCE MYSELF. THAT HAPPY HOUR DEBATE GAVE ME THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU DID GREAT.
AND OBVIOUSLY LAST WEEK GAVE ME THE SECOND OPPORTUNITY.
Jimmy: SURE.
AND WHEN PEOPLE GET TO KNOW ME THEY TEND TO SUPPORT ME. THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN THE POLLS.
Jimmy: WELL, FOR PEOPLE WATCHING MY SHOW TONIGHT THAT DON'T KNOW YOU, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE? WHAT DO YOU WANT THEM TO KNOW ABOUT CARLY FIORINA?
WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A A LITTLE GIRL MY MOTHER SAID TO ME, "WHAT YOU ARE IS GOD'S GIFT TO YOU. WHAT YOU MAKE OF YOURSELF IS YOUR GIFT TO GOD." AND I HAVE LEARNED IN MY LIFE THAT EVERYONE HAS GOD-GIVEN GIFTS. I STARTED AS A SECRETARY. TYPING AND FILING FOR A A NINE-PERSON REAL ESTATE FIRM. IT'S ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY THAT YOU CAN GO FROM BEING A A SECRETARY, TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE LARGEST TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN THE WORLD, AND RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE HERE.
Jimmy: WOW.
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: UNBELIEVABLE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. THAT'S TRUE.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN, REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE, WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE, HOW THEY START, OR WHAT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES, HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULFILL THEIR POTENTIAL AND FIND AND USE THEIR GOD-GIVEN GIFTS, AND THAT ISN'T TRUE IN AMERICA TODAY.
Jimmy I MEAN, BEN CARSON IS IN A LOT OF TROUBLE NOW BECAUSE HE'S SAYING THAT HE WOULD -- HE WOULD NOT ADVOCATE A MUSLIM BEING PRESIDENT.
WELL, I THINK THAT'S WRONG. YOU KNOW, IT SAYS IN OUR CONSTITUTION THAT RELIGION CANNOT BE A TEST FOR OFFICE. IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE JUDGE EACH INDIVIDUAL AND THAT ANYONE, OF ANY FAITH, IS WELCOME HERE. I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE OF FAITH MAKE BETTER LEADERS, WHETHER THEY'RE CHRISTIANS, AS I AM -- MY FAITH HAS SUSTAINED ME THROUGH SOME VERY BAD TIMES. I BATTLED CANCER, I'VE LOST A A CHILD, I'VE BEEN TESTED. BUT WHETHER IT'S A PERSON OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR JEWISH FAITH OR MUSLIM FAITH, OR OTHER FAITHS, I THINK FAITH GIVES US HUMILITY AND EMPATHY AND OPTIMISM AND I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS.
Jimmy: YOU WOULD BE FINE WITH THAT.
YES, I WOULD BE FINE WITH THAT. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE HAVE -- IN NEW YORK CITY, WE HAVE WHAT THEY CALL POPE FEVER.
YES.
Jimmy: THE POPE IS COMING HERE. HE'S STAYING AT MY APARTMENT. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
WOW, THAT'S A MENTAL IMAGE I'M HAVING A HARD TIME --
Jimmy: I PUT THE INVITE OUT. NO, IT'S FUN. IT'S GREAT. I GOT A GOOD --
YOU DO NEED SAVED. [ LAUGHTER ] BIG TIME, JIMMY.
Jimmy: IT'S ONE OF THOSE INFLATABLE BEDS. I TREAT EVERYONE, ALL MY GUESTS GREAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT HE'S COMING. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE POPE?
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE POPE IS HE REMINDS US OF THE RICHNESS OF SPIRITUAL LIFE. I MEAN, THIS IS A PRETTY SUPERFICIAL WORLD SOMETIMES, MAYBE ALL THE TIME, AND HE REMINDS US THAT SPIRITUALITY IS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH. I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM ON ALL OF HIS POLITICS FOR SURE, BUT I CERTAINLY ADMIRE HOW HE IS TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE BUREAUCRACY OF THE CHURCH IN A A LOT OF WAYS AND GO BACK TO SERVING THE POOR AND HELPING PEOPLE. I DO THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT, YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS SAY, OH, HE'S SO RIGHT ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND HE'S SO RIGHT ABOUT CAPITALISM, BUT THEY DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT HIS BELIEF IN THE SANCTITY OF LIFE BECAUSE THAT THEY DON'T AGREE WITH.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND HE'S COMING -- HE'S COMING THIS WEEK AND I THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN IS COMING RIGHT AT THE END.
YES.
Jimmy: AND WHO KNOWS IF THEY'RE GOING TO HOOK UP. I DON'T THINK SO. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT -- BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS RECENTLY SAID HE WANTS -- VLADIMIR PUTIN IS SAYING HE WANTS TO MEET WITH TRUMP WHEN HE COMES HERE. AND THAT HE WANTS TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH HIM. YOU'VE MET PUTIN?
I HAVE. THE TWO OF THEM HAVE A LOT IN COMMON, ACTUALLY. BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. DO YOU DO AN IMITATION OF PUTIN? I COULD TELL YOU IF IT WAS GOOD OR NOT.
Jimmy: I BASICALLY TALK LIKE THIS. AND THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S ALL. I'M A LITTLE -- ARE YOU --
WELL, HE WAS KIND OF LIKE BURSTING OUT OF THE BUTTONS OF HIS SHIRT. YOU KNOW, HE'S KIND OF A A BARREL-CHESTED GUY AND PROUD OF IT. CLEARLY.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. IF HE'S WEARING A SHIRT THAT'S A GOOD DAY.
UH-HUH. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, HE'S ON A A HORSEBACK SHIRTLESS. WHERE DID YOU MEET --
I MET HIM IN BEIJING. WE WERE IN SORT OF A GREEN ROOM SETTING, ACTUALLY. THE TWO OF US WERE GIVING A A SPEECH, EACH OF US WERE GIVING A SPEECH AT A MAJOR ECONOMIC CONFERENCE CALLED A.P.E.C., AND THE TWO OF US WERE SITTING SORT OF IN A CHAIR LIKE THIS, ABOUT THIS CLOSE, FOR 45 MINUTES BEFORE HIS SPEECH AND BEFORE MINE. I WOULD DESCRIBE HIM AS A A FORMIDABLE ADVERSARY. HE'S VERY CONFIDENT, HE'S VERY -- HE ACTUALLY CAN BE QUITE FUNNY AND CHARMING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT HE'S A KGB GUY. YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET THIS. HE LUSTS FOR POWER AND HE'S GATHERED UP A LOT OF IT AND HE'S A VERY BAD ACTOR AND IT'S A VERY BAD THING THAT HIS FIGHTER JETS AND HIS SOLDIERS ARE SITTING IN SYRIA RIGHT NOW. THAT'S A BAD THING.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT A GOOD -- NO, NO, I'M AFRAID TO MEET HIM.
YEAH, WELL -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SCARES ME.
BY THE WAY, I WOULDN'T TALK TO HIM AT ALL. I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS WRONG. I THINK WE TALKED WAY TOO MUCH TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. WHAT I WOULD DO IS IMMEDIATELY BEGIN REBUILDING THE SIXTH FLEET, I'D REBUILD THE MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM IN POLAND, I'D CONDUCT REGULAR MILITARY EXERCISES IN THE BALTICS, I'D PUT A FEW MORE THOUSANDS TROOPS INTO GERMANY. I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN LEADING IN SYRIA THREE YEARS AGO BECAUSE OBAMA AND CLINTON HAVEN'T. WE HAVE FAR FEWER OPTIONS HERE. PUTIN NEEDS TO SEE THAT HE FACES STRENGTH AND RESOLVE AND LEADERSHIP FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HE WOULD SEE THAT FROM ME. HE'S NOT SEEING THAT UNFORTUNATELY FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION.
Jimmy: I WANT TO ASK YOU TO DO SOMETHING SILLY. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT OUR SHOW IS ALL ABOUT.
YEAH, WELL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE WERE TALKING BACKSTAGE, AND I GO, WOULD YOU MIND -- WE WERE TALKING. YOU SING SONGS TO YOUR GRANDKIDS.
UH-HUH.
Jimmy: YEAH. NOW -- [ LAUGHTER ] AGAIN --
OH.
Jimmy: I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. I KNOW THIS IS NOT FOR THEM. THIS IS FOR -- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SNICKERS.
I HAVE --
Jimmy: AND MAX.
I HAVE TWO DOGS. SNICKERS AND MAX. THEY'RE YORKSHIRE TERRIERS. BUT I HAVE TO EXPLAIN. SEE, I MAKE UP SONGS. MY MOTHER AND I USED TO SING TOGETHER ALL THE TIME, AND I SING TO MY GRANDDAUGHTERS.
Jimmy: IS IT DORKY?
DORKY?
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
MY DOGS ARE NOT DORKY.
Jimmy: NO, NO. IS THE SINGING DORKY? 'CAUSE I KNOW --
I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: I SING TO MY DOG AND IT IS DORKY. [ LAUGHTER ] WE ALL DO.
YOU WANT TO HEAR A VERSE?
Jimmy: NO. NO THANKS. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, I DON'T KNOW. I JUST MAKE UP SONGS. I HAVE ONE DOG. SO I JUST --
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT I JUST --
DO YOU WANT ME TO HUM A BAR OR TWO?
Jimmy: YEAH. WE ALWAYS HAVE MICROPHONES READY TO GO. AGAIN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY OF THIS.
OKAY, WELL, LET'S SEE. THIS IS A SONG IN FOUR VERSES. I'LL ONLY GIVE YOU ONE. ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?
Jimmy: WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU THIS RIGHT HERE.
ARE WE READY? MAYBE WE CAN CLAP ALONG.
Jimmy: ARE YOU SURE? ABOSLUTELY.
