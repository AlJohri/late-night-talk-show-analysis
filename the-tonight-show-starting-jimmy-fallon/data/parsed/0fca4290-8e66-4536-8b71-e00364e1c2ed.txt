Steve: LOVE IT. LOVE IT!
Jimmy: OH, LISTEN TO THIS. SO, EXPERTS ARE WARNING SHOPPERS TO CHECK THE SPELLING OF WEBSITES ON CYBER MONDAY BECAUSE THERE ARE LOOKALIKE SITES THAT TRY TO SCAM YOU WITH A SLIGHT MISSPELLING OF A A STORE'S NAME. YEP, THEY SAID IF YOU WANT MORE INFO ON THIS, JUST LOOK IT UP ON GOGGLE. [ APPLAUSE ] GOGGLE SHOULD HAVE IT. BLACK FRIDAY WAS THE BIGGEST SHOPPING DAY OF THE YEAR IN THE U.S., BUT SOME STORES IN CANADA ALSO OFFERED THEIR OWN DOOR BUSTER DEALS. AND I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS, AND IT MADE ME REALIZE HOW DIFFERENT OUR TWO COUNTRIES ARE. LOOK AT THIS STORE IN THE U.S. ON FRIDAY. [ SHOUTING ]
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. THAT'S -- YEAH. YEAH, OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW TAKE A LOOK AT BLACK FRIDAY IN CANADA. [ APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SINGLE FILE, PEOPLE ARE CLAPPING.

[ APPLAUSE ] BUT THE BIG STORY RIGHT NOW IS STILL PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP. HE HAS BEEN BUSY TWEETING AGAIN. [ AUDIENCE GROANS ] [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. HE WENT ON TWITTER YESTERDAY TO CLAIM THAT HE ACTUALLY WON THE POPULAR VOTE IF YOU DEDUCT THE MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL VOTERS AND THAT ANY RECOUNT WILL CHANGE NOTHING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF NOTHING CHANGING, TRUMP WON AND STILL SAYS THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T UNDERSTAND. [ APPLAUSE ] OH, WELL, THIS HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE UPSET. I READ THAT THE SECRET SERVICE PROTECTING DONALD TRUMP MIGHT HAVE TO RENT TWO FLOORS OF TRUMP TOWER, FORCING TAXPAYERS TO PAY $3 MILLION IN RENT BACK TO TRUMP'S COMPANY. [ AUDIENCE GROANS ] TRUMP SAID THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE AND THE RENT IS $4 MILLION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHOEVER SAID THAT, THAT IS A -- LOWBALL. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. TRUMP COULD CHARGE HIS OWN SECRET SERVICE AGENTS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN RENT. THEN TRUMP WAS LIKE, "THAT'S NOTHING. WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT I CHARGE THEM FOR THE MINI-BAR. THAT'S WHERE I GET YOU." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YESTERDAY, TRUMP WAS SEEN WEARING A HAT THAT SAYS "45" ON THE SIDE, SIGNIFYING THAT HE WILL BE THE 45th PRESIDENT. OR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DAYS BEFORE HE QUITS BEING PRESIDENT. HE'S LIKE, "IT'S BEEN FUN --IT'S BEEN A FUN MONTH AND A HALF. YOU TAKE IT FROM HERE, PENCE." [ APPLAUSE ] DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? ARETHA FRANKLIN PERFORMED THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AT THE LIONS/VIKINGS FOOTBALL GAME ON THANKSGIVING. HER RENDITION LASTED OVER 4 1/2 MINUTES. EVEN THE NFL PLAYERS WHO WEREN'T PROTESTING ANYTHING WERE LIKE, "I GOT TO SIT THIS ONE OUT. I GOT TO TAKE A KNEE. I GOTTA PLAY -- I GOTTA PLAY FOOTBALL HERE." [ APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. A MAN IN CALIFORNIA WAS ARRESTED LAST WEEK AFTER POLICE DISCOVERED $330,000 WORTH OF MARIJUANA IN HIS CAR, WRAPPED LIKE CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] POLICE GOT SUSPICIOUS BECAUSE NO MONEY DOES HIS CHRISTMAS SHOPPING THAT EARLY. THAT IS JUST TOO OBVIOUS. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU GUYS READY? WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT.

Jimmy: YOU LOOK GORGEOUS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jimmy: APPRECIATE IT. OH, PLEASE, PLEASE. I JUST -- I CAN'T BE THE ONLY PERSON JUST GETTING INTO "GILMORE GIRLS" NOW, BUT -- AM I?
I DON'T THINK SO.
Jimmy: NO. YEAH, NO. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T FIND IT WEIRD THAT I'M GETTING INTO IT NOW?
NO. NO. SO MANY PEOPLE DISCOVERED THE SHOW ON NETFLIX. IT WAS LIKE WE GOT A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF FANS FROM, YOU KNOW, NETFLIX PICKING IT UP.
Jimmy: IT IS HOT. IT IS LIKE EVERYWHERE. I CAN'T TURN -- I MEAN, IT'S EVERYWHERE. YEAH, EXACTLY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW, NO SPOILERS. I DON'T WANT YOU TELLING ME ANYTHING.
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING.
Jimmy: YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING. BUT YOU'RE FANTASTIC IN THE SHOW.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jimmy: AND I AM A FAN. AND I JUST CAUGHT UP WITH SEASON FOUR. I'M UP THROUGH -- I JUST FINISHED SEASON FOUR. [ SIGH ]
I KNOW.
Jimmy: I MEAN, I'M UPSET WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT. BUT I DON'T KNOW -- [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, NO, I UNDERSTAND. I REMEMBER GETTING THAT SCRIPT AND THINKING, THIS IS SO OUT OF CHARACTER.
Jimmy: I MEAN, YOU KNOW -- I MEAN, THIS IS A BIG DEAL GOES DOWN. AND YOU KNOW I'M TEAM JESS.
I KNOW, I KNOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: LET'S JUST SAY DEAN GETS INVOLVED SOMEHOW AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT EITHER. IT'S NOT A GOOD MOVE, CLEARLY.
Jimmy: BUT YOU AND MOM, YOU AND LORELAI GET INTO A THING. AND YOU GO, WHAT.
IT'S LIKE A BIG FIGHT. I KNOW --
Jimmy: I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU GUYS BE IN A FIGHT. YOU DON'T EVEN -- BECAUSE THE SCENE DOESN'T EVEN WORK LIKE THAT.
IT'S NOT GREAT. I KNOW. I THINK THAT THE HEAD CREATOR OF THE CHARACTER WAS SO SEEMINGLY PERFECT THAT THEY HAD TO, LIKE, THROW SOMETHING AT HER, BUT I THINK THEY OVERCORRECTED. CLEARLY, WE OVERCORRECTED.
Jimmy: YOU REALLY WENT FOR IT, MAN.
LIKE WHOA, WHAT HAPPENED? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE HAD A THING. WE HAD MY TOP THREE CHARACTERS THAT AREN'T YOU AND LAUREN GRAHAM ON THE SHOW. AND IT WAS LUKE, IT WAS KIRK, AND IT WAS PARIS GELLER, OF COURSE, YEAH. DID YOU HAVE A -- DID YOU HAVE A TOP FOUR "GILMORE GIRLS" CHARACTERS THAT AREN'T YOU?
I SURE DO. I THINK THAT CESAR IS AWESOME. HE WORKS AT LUKE'S. I THINK HE KIND OF RUNS THE PLACE. LIKE IF HE HAS TO GO BE WITH LORELAI, HE'S LIKE I GOT IT. HE'S AWESOME.
Jimmy: OH YEAH, OKAY. THAT'S RIGHT, HE HAS THE SECRET ONE, YEAH.
HE'S, LIKE -- HE'S UNDERRATED, HE'S AMAZING. AND THEN, BABETTE, MISS PATTY, THEY WERE ON "ALL IN THE FAMILY" TOGETHER, AND EVERY TIME THEY WOULD COME TO SET.
Jimmy: I KNEW SALLY STRUTHERS WAS -- I DIDN'T KNOW --
YEAH, LIZ TORRES AS WELL. SHE HAD BEEN ON THE SHOW FOR YEARS AND YEARS SO EVERY TIME THEY WOULD COME TO SET, THEY WOULD LIKE, GET TOGETHER AND SING SHOW TUNES. AND IT WAS SUCH A RAUCOUS DAY ON SET EVERY DAY THEY WERE THERE. I HAVE TO APPRECIATE THEM. AND THEN KIRK AS WELL.
Jimmy: I MEAN KIRK IS UNBELIEVABLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO, IT'S -- IT BECAME A GIANT HIT, SO CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS. A LOT OF FANS WERE SAYING THAT AFTER SEEING SOME PROMOTIONAL PHOTOS -- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY?
YEAH, I THINK SO.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T THINK YOU KNOW HOW TO HOLD THINGS. [ LAUGHTER ]
SURE.
Jimmy: THAT'S JUDGING AND LET'S JUST HEAR IT FROM ALEXIS. I THINK THIS IS HOW SOMEONE HOLDS FLOWERS, AND -- [ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK SOMEBODY --
Jimmy: YEAH, IF YOU WERE, LIKE, TOSSED THEM OR SOMETHING. OR, I DON'T KNOW, I THINK THAT'S FINE. BUT THEN MY FAVORITE ONE IS -- THIS IS THE BEST ONE. THIS IS YOU HOLDING A COFFEE MUG.
LIKE, HOW --
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT NORMAL. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT NORMAL. NO ONE HOLDS A COFFEE MUG -- WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, MOSTLY IT'S NOT NORMAL BECAUSE IT'S AN OVERSIZED COFFEE MUG. THAT COFFEE MUG IS ALMOST AS BIG AS MY FACE SO I FEEL LIKE I WAS SET UP TO FAIL THERE SOMEWHAT. MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: HOW WOULD YOU HOLD THAT MUG?
THIS IS NORMALLY SIZED, SO THIS IS NO PROBLEM. I GOT IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: WELL, I -- THE FOUR WORDS -- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT, REALLY, WHAT THEY WERE. BUT --
RIGHT. WE KNOW WE CAN'T SAY.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T SAY WHAT THE FOUR WORDS WERE, BUT DID YOU KNOW WHAT THE FOUR WORDS WERE GOING TO BE?
I DID. I --
Jimmy: WHEN?
WELL, AMY TOLD ME -- I'M VERY SHOCKED --
Jimmy: WHAT SEASON -- WHAT SEASON DID YOU HEAR THE FOUR WORDS?
NO, SHE TOLD ME WHEN WE WERE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS REUNION.
Jimmy: OKAY, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO, NO IDEA.
NO SPOILERS.
Jimmy: NO IDEA, SEASON FIVE, YOU WERE LIKE -- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FOUR WORDS ARE.
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW. NO WAY. SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF UNTIL THE VERY END.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO AMY SHERMAN-PALLADINO.
SO SECRETIVE AND YEAH, SO AMY.
Jimmy: ANOTHER -- ANOTHER PIECE OF WORK THAT I'M A FAN OF YOURS IS THE "SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M A BIG FAN OF THAT. SAW BOTH OF THEM. SAW THE SECOND ONE IN THEATERS. YOU GUYS GO TO GREECE AND JUST LET IT ALL HANG OUT, MAN, AND GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS -- I WOULD SAY, IF THIS THING IS A GIANT -- BECAUSE IT'S A GIANT HIT, WOULD YOU EVER BRING BACK ALL THOSE GIRLS? I LOVE ALL THE GIRLS.
I KNOW, THEY'RE SO AMAZING. I MEAN, WE WOULD ALL LOVE TO DO IT. I THINK IT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN. AND WE TALK ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE AMBER TAMBLYN, BLAKE LIVELY.
I THINK IT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN. I THINK WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY DO IT. WE'RE WORKING ON IT, SO WE'LL SEE IF IT HAPPENS.
Jimmy: YOU WERE WORKING ON IT? THAT'S SOMETHING -- REALLY? YOU ARE? MAYBE?
YEAH, IT WOULD BE SO FUN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I WAS THINKING MAYBE IF YOU WANTED TO, WE COULD -- I COULD REBOOT IT WITH MEN AND CALL IT THE BOYHOOD OR BROTHERHOOD OF TRAVELING PANTS.
WOW.
Jimmy: WITH ME, KEVIN HART, GET PAUL RUDD IN THERE, MARK- PAUL GOSSELAAR.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? PCCP
Jimmy: I SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, THINK YOU COME OUT WITH THE THIRD ONE, "SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS," GET THE WHOLE TEAM BACK TOGETHER AND YOU GUYS TALK TO EACH OTHER, YOU'RE OLDER NOW AND YOU GO, WHO HAS THE PANTS?
WHERE ARE THEY?
Jimmy: WHERE ARE THE PANTS? YOU GO, WAIT, I THOUGHT YOU HAD THEM AND YOU GO, I CHECKED MY FEDEX TRACKING NUMBER. YOU HAD THEM THE LAST TIME.
AND THEN IT GETS -- IT GETS A LITTLE HOSTILE. LIKE MAYBE THERE'S A CONFLICT.
Jimmy: YEAH, THEN YOU GO WAIT, CONFLICT -- WHO HAS IT. MAYBE SOMEONE'S KID IS WEARING THE PANTS. MAYBE SOMEONE'S MOM IS WEARING THE PANTS.
BUT THEN WE FIGURE IT OUT, CLEARLY WE --.
Jimmy: IT'S CLEARLY -- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHO -- MAYBE IT'S BEEN PUT ON A SCARECROW AND --
OR IT'S BEEN MADE INTO A A VEST.
Jimmy: IT'S TURNED INTO A A HORROR MOVIE. AND A SCARECROW IS WALKING AROUND WITH TRAVELING PANTS. I DON'T KNOW. AGAIN, I'M NOT -- I COME UP WITH BIG PICTURE IDEAS. THEN IT'S UP TO YOU TO REALLY FINISH IT OFF.
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
Jimmy: I LOVE YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR NOT GIVING AWAY ANY SPOILER ALERTS. I KNOW THAT WAS TOUGH. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. HERE'S ALEXIS BLEDEL, IT'S NOT A SPOILER, IN "GILMORE GIRLS: A A YEAR IN THE LIFE." TAKE A LOOK AT RORY.
I THINK IT'S KIND OF EXCITING, YOU KNOW. NO APARTMENT, NO RENT, NO TIES. I COULD CRASH HERE, I COULD CRASH AT LANE'S. I FEEL LIKE THIS IS MY TIME TO BE ROOTLESS AND JUST SEE WHERE LIFE TAKES ME AND TRAVEL WHEREVER THERE'S A STORY TO WRITE. I JUST WISH I REMEMBERED TO LABEL MY BOXES BECAUSE NOW I KNOW WHERE NOTHING IS, MY BOOTS, MY COATS, MY UNDERWEAR.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE YOUR UNDERWEAR IS?
COULD BE AT LANE'S.
YOU'VE BEEN WITHOUT YOUR UNDERWEAR SINCE YOU MOVED?
DON'T JUDGE.
I'M GWEN FREAKIN' STEFANI -- DO YOU WANT TO BORROW SOME UNDERWEAR?
I WOULD LIKE TO STOP TALKING ABOUT UNDERWEAR. I'M LOOKING FOR MY LUCKY OUTFIT.
I THINK ANY OUTFIT YOU WEAR WITHOUT UNDERWEAR IS GONNA BE YOUR LUCKY OUTFIT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
