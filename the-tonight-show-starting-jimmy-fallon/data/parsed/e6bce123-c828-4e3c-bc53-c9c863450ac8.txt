IT WAS AWESOME.
Jimmy: OH, THANK YOU. HE'S THE BEST. HE'S THE BEST GUY EVER.

Jimmy: PHEW, UH --
20 YEARS OF PAIN?
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S CRAZY. I MEAN, WHEN ARE YOU IN NEW YORK?
THE BOWERY BALLROOM.

IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE PLACE.
Jimmy: THE STEPHEN TALKHOUSE IN AMAGANSETT. THE STONE PONY, IN ASBURY PARK, NEW JERSEY. THAT'S -- [ CHEERS ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S COOL.
THERE YOU GO.
Jimmy: DO YOU, LIKE -- DO YOU HAVE A TOUR BUS AND ALL THAT STUFF?
WE DO. FIRST TOUR, WE PLAYED ABOUT 100 DATES. WE HAD A BUS. THAT, AT ONE POINT, IT HAD 13 OF US ON IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN I KIND OF FINALLY FIGURED OUT THAT WITH DOING THE SHOW FOR NINE MONTHS A YEAR AND TOURING, MAYBE I SHOULD GET MY OWN BUS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH. EXACTLY, YEAH.
AND I CAN USE THAT AS A A TRAILER WHEN I'M SHOOTING "DESIGNATED SURVIVOR."
Jimmy: HOW COOL IS THAT? YOU HAVE A TOUR BUS.
WELL, IT'S GOOD, AND THEN IT'S NOT SO GOOD. I'VE GOTTEN TO A POINT NOW WHERE THE BAND IS LIKE, "YEAH, YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF."
Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S LIKE, "I ACTUALLY LIVE HERE, YEAH."
THEY'RE NOT ABOUT THAT AT ALL.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT A PARTY BUS ANYMORE, YEAH. DO PEOPLE GO -- DO FANS GO CRAZY WHICH THEY SEE YOU ON STAGE?
WELL I THINK ONE OF THE COOL THINGS IS WE PLAY REALLY SMALL VENUES, BARS, ANYWHERE FROM 250 PEOPLE TO 500 PEOPLE. SO, IT'S A REALLY INTIMATE SETTING.
Jimmy: GREAT!
AND I HAVE A REALLY FANTASTIC BAND. AND THE SONGS ARE VERY PERSONAL TO ME. THEY'RE MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES, AND -- AND SO WHEN YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY, "YOU KNOW, I WAS IN THIS PLACE WHEN I WROTE THIS SONG. THIS IS WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH," YOU KIND OF START THIS SHARED EXPERIENCE. AND WHAT I'VE FIGURED OUT IS THAT BY THE END OF THE SHOW, WE START TO REALIZE WE'VE GOT A A LOT MORE IN COMMON THAN WE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT, AND IT'S A A REALLY KIND OF -- IT'S A A GENEROUS THING --
Jimmy: YEAH.
THE AUDIENCE.
Jimmy: YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT.
SO MY EXPERIENCE WITH IT HAS BEEN FANTASTIC SO FAR.
Jimmy: WERE YOU ALWAYS INTO COUNTRY MUSIC? BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE MORE OF, LIKE, A ROCK GUY.
I CERTAINLY WAS. I THINK, STILL MY TEMPERAMENT MIGHT GO MORE THAT WAY, BUT I LOVE STORYTELLING. IT'S WHAT EXCITES ME ABOUT ACTING, AND IT'S --
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHAT I KIND OF STARTED WRITING MYSELF INTO, KIND OF TOWARDS COUNTRY MUSIC BECAUSE I LOVE JOHNNY CASH, WAYLON JENNINGS, MERLE HAGGARD.
Jimmy: HANK WILLIAMS.
KRIS KRISTOFFERSON, AND THEY WERE ALL GREAT STORYTELLERS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO MY MUSIC IS VERY LYRIC-DEPENDENT, AND I REALLY AM TRYING TO TELL A STORY. AND THAT KIND OF EXPRESSION IS KIND OF -- COUNTRY MUSIC KIND OF FOUND ME THAT WAY.
Jimmy: THAT'S PRETTY COOL. IT'S CALLED "DOWN IN A HOLE" RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT ON THE iTUNES OR WHEREVER YOU CAN STREAM IT.
THANKS.
Jimmy: PLEASE, GO CHECK IT OUT. AND TOUR DATES, HOW DO WE FIND OUT WHERE YOU'RE ON TOUR? KIEFERSUTHERLAND --

YEAH.
Jimmy: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR SHOW, ANOTHER HIT SHOW. I GO -- I JUST LOVE YOU. I WAS JUST TELLING YOU BACKSTAGE --
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jimmy: AND OBVIOUSLY, FROM "24," I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO COME BACK TO TV. I THOUGHT YOU WERE LIKE, "YEAH, I DID JACK BAUER."
IT WASN'T THE PLAN, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT'S -- AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL THIS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING REALLY HARD JOBS.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, YEAH.
BUT DOING A TELEVISION SHOW ISN'T SIMPLE, AND THE HOURS ARE LONG.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND YOU'RE MAKING -- CERTAINLY WHEN DOING "24," IT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF MAKING 12 FILM AS YEAR, WHICH IS PRETTY UNHEARD OF IN A A NINE-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME. AND SO, AFTER NINE YEARS, I WAS LIKE, "I'LL TAKE A BREAK."
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. AND I GOT SENT --
Jimmy: WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO DO ON YOUR BREAK?
I HAD NO IDEA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TRY AND GET TO THE GYM IN BETWEEN THE BAR.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW? BUT -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD SONG.
THEY'RE IN MY WORKOUT PLAN.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD SONG. YOU NEED TO PUT THAT IN THE EXTENDED -- YEAH.
BUT MARK GORDON, WHO HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR 20 YEARS, WHO WAS THE PRODUCER OF THE SHOW, SENT ME THE SCRIPT. AND I WAS GIVING IT THIS CURSORY READ, WHICH IS BASICALLY TRYING TO GET ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO EXPLAIN ON WHY I CAN'T DO IT, AND AROUND PAGE 20 I WAS LIKE, "OH, NO." I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SCRIPT AND I THOUGHT -- I REMEMBER THIS KIND OF VERY PROFOUND MOMENT FOR ME WAS LIKE, "I MIGHT BE HOLDING THE NEXT 10 YEARS OF MY LIFE IN MY HANDS." AND IF I'M LUCKY ENOUGH, WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THE SHOW LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: IT'S GREAT, AND --
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: PEOPLE ARE LOVING IT. IS IT A REAL THING, DESIGNATED SURVIVOR?
YEAH, YEAH. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY I KNEW THAT. I ACTUALLY DID KNOW THAT BEFORE I READ IT. I THINK I'VE BEEN WATCHING TOO MUCH OF THE HISTORY CHANNEL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT, NO. IT DOES EXIST, AND USUALLY IT'S VIEWED AS A PUNISHMENT LIKE YOU'RE NOT INVITED TO THE BALL. YOU'RE NOT INVITED TO THE STATE OF THE UNION, SO YOU'RE THE DESIGNATED SURVIVOR, AND YOU HAVE TO THE SEQUESTERED IN A HOTEL ROOM. AND CERTAINLY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF OUR SHOW, YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK THE MOST QUALIFIED PERSON TO BE THE DESIGNATED SURVIVOR BECAUSE, THERE'S A CHANCE THEY COULD BECOME PRESIDENT OVERNIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH. WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN? THE PRESIDENT AND THE CABINET?
WELL, THE LINE OF SUCCESSION TO THE PRESIDENCY HAS TO BE WIPED OUT. SO, IT WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE ON DOWN THE LINE. AND IN THE CASE OF OUR SHOW, IT WAS AT A STATE OF THE UNION, SO THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT WAS WIPED OUT, EXCEPT FOR ME.
Jimmy: WOW. SO NOW YOU HAVE TO RUN -- YOU HAVE TO RUN THE COUNTRY.
WITHOUT ANY EXPERIENCE. GO FIGURE.
Jimmy: GO FIGURE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] COME ON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SOMEONE HAD A FORTUNE COOKIE. YES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S REALLY GREAT, AND THIS SEASON NOW, YOUR CHARACTER SURVIVES AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT.
