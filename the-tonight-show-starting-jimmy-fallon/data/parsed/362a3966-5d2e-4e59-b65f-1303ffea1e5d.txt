I'M SO EXCITED.

I LOVE NEW YORK AND I COME HERE -- I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TOYING WITH THE IDEA OF GETTING A PLACE HERE.
Jimmy: THAT'D BE FUN!
I KNOW.
Jimmy: THE CITY WOULD WELCOME YOU AND LOVE TO HAVE YOU HERE.
I WOULD TEAR IT APART.
Jimmy: NO, YOU WOULD NOT. YOU CAME HERE WHEN YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL?
YEAH, OKAY. SO I STARTED COMING TO NEW YORK WAS, LIKE, 16, DURING THE SUMMER. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS ABOUT ME, AND I THINK IT'S AN ODD FACT. I USED TO COME HERE AND STUDY AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY --
Jimmy: WHEN YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL?
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL -- COMPARATIVE RELIGION -- FOR FUN IN THE SUMMER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SOUNDS LIKE A BLAST. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, I WISH I COULD DO IT. I'M TOO BUSY GOING DOWN WATER SLIDES. BUT, FOR FUN, YOU WOULD DO THAT?
YEAH, I THOUGHT WAS REALLY FUN. I KIND OF -- I'VE KIND OF ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED WITH RELIGION AND LEADERS OF RELIGION AND LEADERS OF CULTS.
Jimmy: WERE YOU GOOD IN SCHOOL? I MEAN, WHAT'D YOU GET ON YOUR S.A.T.s?
YEAH, I GOT A 1500. ALMOST PERFECT ON MY SATs.
Jimmy: OH, I GOT 1550, SO. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU DID NOT!
Jimmy: IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. MY GRANDMOTHER GOT RUN OVER BY A REINDEER.
I HEARD. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
Jimmy: NO. I TOTALLY ACCEPT IT. SO, DID YOU GO TO COLLEGE?
NO, THEN I DROPPED OUT AND GOT MY G.E.D. AND LOOK AT ME NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO. YOU'RE SAYING IT'S GOOD FOR YOU, BUT YOU JUST STARTED CONCENTRATING ON MUSIC. YOU GO THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.
YEAH, AFTER TAKING THE S.A.T. AND GETTING THE SCORE, I WAS, LIKE, EH.
Jimmy: NOT FOR YOU.
NAH. CAN I SAY BAD WORDS?
Jimmy: NO.
OKAY.
Jimmy: WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY?
I WAS GONNA SAY [ BLEEP ] IT.
Jimmy: EH, YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LOOKING OVER AT OUR JUDGES, THEY SAID NO. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. OUR EXPERTS SAID YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. BUT YOU -- YOU SAID SCREW IT AND YOU GO -- 1550.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
NO, YOU DIDN'T GET A 1550.
Jimmy: I WAS IN THE 900s. 1080P, IS THAT SOMETHING? I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY SCORE WAS. SO THEN YOU GET INTO -- I HEARD THE STORY THAT YOU HAD A DEMO OF YOUR MUSIC.
YES.
Jimmy: AND YOU BROKE INTO PRINCE'S HOUSE.
I DID. OKAY.
Jimmy: HOW DO YOU BREAK INTO PRINCE'S HOUSE?
IT WAS SO EASY.
Jimmy: WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: NOW, IT'S DIFFERENT.
I MEAN, PROBABLY SINCE THEN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HOW'D YOU BREAK INTO HIS HOUSE?
I, LIKE, CRUISED UP IN MY DEAD GRANDPA'S CAR. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAIT. MY CONDOLENCES, BY THE WAY. REINDEER?
REINDEER.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. SORRY.
SO I GET OUT AND THERE'S A A GARDENER IN THE FRONT YARD AND I WAS, LIKE, "HERE, FIVE BUCKS, AND JUST DON'T MAKE A A THING. AND I'M JUST GONNA SLIDE RIGHT UNDER THIS GATE." AND HE JUST LAUGHED AND THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY. AND I WAS, YOU KNOW, CHARMING AT THE TIME.
Jimmy: YOU'RE CHARMING.
AND SO I SNUCK UNDER THE FENCE, AND THEN I JUST TROLLOPED UP THE MOUNTAIN.
Jimmy: HE LIVES ON A A MOUNTAIN? [ LAUGHTER ] I KNEW THAT PRINCE WOULD LIVE ON A MOUNTAIN!
HE DOES.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO COOL. BUT, NO. IN MY DREAMS THAT'S WHERE HE LIVES. HE FLOATS ON TOP OF A HOME.
HE DOES! WELL, EVERYTHING IN HIS HOME, ONCE I -- OKAY, SO THE DOOR WAS OPEN. IT WAS UNLOCKED.
Jimmy: THAT'S YOUR FIRST MISTAKE.
I KNOW. SO I WAS LIKE IT'S BASICALLY AN INVITATION, SO I WALKED IN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS SO WRONG, YEAH.
AND EVERYTHING WAS PURPLE VELVET. SO I WAS, LIKE, VERY PLEASED --
Jimmy: YEAH.
-- THAT MY FANTASY HAD COME TRUE AND THERE REALLY WAS PURPLE VELVET EVERYWHERE. AND I WALKED INTO THE ELEVATOR. AND THERE'S PRINCE MUSIC PLAYING.
Jimmy: ELEVATOR, OF COURSE.
AND THEN, I GO UP IN THE ELEVATOR, AND I COME OUT. AND I'M ON THE PHONE WITH MY MOM, BEING LIKE, "I THINK I MIGHT GET ARRESTED." AND THEN I WALK OUT. AND THERE'S PRINCE PLAYING THE GUITAR WITH A BEANIE ON. AND I ALMOST POOPED MY PANTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT'D HE SAY?
HE JUST KIND OF LOOKED AT ME FUNNY.
Jimmy: GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE.
NO, I DIDN'T EVEN GET THAT. I JUST GOT A LOOK, LIKE, "WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?" AND THEN I JUST WAVED AROUND A A CD. AND I PUT IT ON A TABLE, AND THEN I RAN AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DID YOU EVER HEAR BACK FROM HIM?
NOT YET. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOT YET. YOU'RE STILL WAITING FOR IT? NO, NOW YOU'RE KESHA. YOU'RE TICK TOCK.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU DID IT. YOU'RE A MULTI-PLATINUM SELLING ARTIST.

WELL, I JUST LOVE HIM. HE'S MY FAVORITE.
Jimmy: WELL, HE WATCHES THE SHOW ALL THE TIME. I'M SURE HE'LL --
CALL ME.
Jimmy: BUT NOW YOU'RE DOING THIS "RISING STAR" SHOW ON ABC.
YES.
Jimmy: IT'S A SINGING COMPETITION.
MM-HMM.
Jimmy: THE NEW THING EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT IS WHERE YOU VOTE FROM HOME, YOU SWIPE ON YOUR iPHONE OR ANY PHONE.
YOU GET THE APP AND YOU HEAR SOMEONE SING. AND YOU EITHER SWIPE "YES" OR YOU THINK THEY SUCK AND YOU SWIPE "NO."
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
YES.
Jimmy: BUT WHEN YOU DO IT, YOUR FACE SHOWS UP ON THE --
AND IF YOU SWIPE YES, YOUR FACE SHOWS UP ON THIS GIANT, VERY INTIMIDATING WALL.
Jimmy: THAT'S KIND OF FUN. I WOULD JUST SWIPE "YES" JUST TO SEE MY FACE ON TV.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I DON'T EVEN CARE. IN FACT, IF THE SINGER IS BAD, I'D BE THE FIRST PERSON TO SAY YES.
YEAH. YOU'D BE ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE UP ON THE WALL.
Jimmy: EXACTLY. THAT'S HOW I WOULD DO IT. LOOK, I'M FAMOUS, PRINCE. YEAH. EXACTLY. THAT'S PRETTY FUN. IT'S YOU, YOU GOT JOSH GROBAN IN THE HOUSE. WHO ELSE IS THERE?
