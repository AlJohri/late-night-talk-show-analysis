YEAH. I DIDN'T DO THE EARLIER JACK PAAR SHOWS BUT I WAS A BIG FAN OF THEM. JOHNNY AND I GREW UP 40 MILES APART. HE GREW UP IN NORFOLK, NEBRASKA. I GREW UP JUST UP THE ROAD IN YANKTON, SOUTH DAKOTA. IT CAME UP ON THE AIR ONE TIME AND HE SAID, "BUT I THINK I'M A A LITTLE OLDER THAN YOU." I MADE THE MISTAKE OF SAYING, "GOD, I HOPE SO." I GOT A BIG LAUGH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GOT A BIG LAUGH, BUT I SAID, "BUT YOU GOT A FEW MORE DOLLARS THAN I DO, JOHN." IT GOT ANOTHER BIG LAUGH, NOW I KNOW I'M IN TROUBLE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HE WAITS FOR THE LAUGHTER TO DIE DOWN AND HE LOOKS AT ME AND SAYS, "I HOPE SO." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, HE KNEW HE HAD TO RIDE OUT THAT LAUGH. I WANT TO GET INTO POLITICS AND ASK YOU, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON EVERYTHING, BECAUSE NOW WE'RE A A WEEK INTO TRUMP PRESIDENCY. HOW IS IT GOING SO FAR, ACCORDING TO YOU?
WELL, I THINK IT DEPENDS ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW. FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW THEY THINK IT'S GOING VERY WELL. THIS IS WHAT HE WAS ELECTED TO DO. EVERYBODY HAS TO REMEMBER THAT. HE DIDN'T SAY HE WAS GONNA DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY. I DO THINK THAT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHEN IN THE HILL, THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD MAKE WHAT THEY CALL A PIVOT AND BE A LITTLE MORE PRESIDENTIAL. BUT WHAT HE HAS DONE IS EXTENDED HIS CAMPAIGN, BECAUSE HE THINKS IT RIGHTLY CONNECTS HIM TO THAT CORE SUPPORT GROUP THAT HE HAD OUT THERE WHO SAID, "GO TO WASHINGTON, AND DRAIN THE SWAMP, AND RETURN THE POWER TO THE PEOPLE." AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S DETERMINED TO DO. NOW, BEING IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS A LOT HARDER THAN MOST PEOPLE REALIZE AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT FROM DAY TO DAY AND EVEN WITHIN A DAY, THEY'RE CHANGING A LOT OF THE POSITIONS BECAUSE THEY GET A A LOT OF BLOWBACK WHEN THEY SAY SOMETHING, AND YOU SIT DOWN IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND STUFF STARTS COMING IN OVER THE DOOR, AND THROUGH THE WINDOW, AND UNDER THE RUG. AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO DEAL WITH. SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, PUTTING TARIFFS ON MEXICAN GOODS. THAT STARTED IN THE MORNING. THEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY, THERE WAS A LITTLE MAYBE NOT. AND BY THE END OF THE DAY, WE'RE IN A FULL-BLOWN ECONOMIC WAR WITH MEXICO, AT THIS POINT. AND IT'S ONE OF OUR BIGGEST TRADING PARTNERS. AND THE FACT IS, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT SOME AMMO ON THIS REGARD.
Jimmy: YEAH, REALLY INTERESTING.
SO IT'S TOUGH. BUT IT'S FROM A PRESS POINT OF VIEW. IT'S FASCINATING. THEY'VE DECLARED WAR ON US. MADE IT CLEAR, THE MEDIA, THEY THINK IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY. I THINK THAT'S NOT JUST A A TACTIC, I THINK IT'S A A STRATEGY. IT'S HOW THEY KEEP THEIR SUPPORTERS IN LINE, BECAUSE THEY'RE ANGRY WITH US. THEY THINK WE'VE BETRAYED WHAT IT IS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. WE HAVE TO STAY COOL. WE HAVE TO DO OUR JOB. NOT GET IN SOME KIND OF AN IDEOLOGICAL WAR WITH THEM OR A A "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH" WAR. IT'S WHEN HE SAYS ON THURSDAY THAT THE CIA RELEASING THE STATEMENTS THAT THEY DID WERE LIKE "NAZIS." AND THEN ON SATURDAY HE SAYS, WHEN HE GOES TO THE CIA, "NO ONE LOVES THE CIA MORE THAN I DO." WELL, IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO SAY, "THURSDAY HE SAID THIS. SATURDAY HE SAID THAT." SHOWING THE CROWDS AT THE INAUGURATION. WE TOOK AERIAL VIEWS. WE DID THIS ON A ROUTINELY -- THE KIND OF THING WE DO EVERY INAUGURATION. HERE'S THE BIG CROWD. OR HERE'S A SLIGHTLY SMALLER CROWD. HE'S CRAZED BY THE IDEA THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE A BIGGER CROWD THAN OBAMA DID. HE'S ASKING EVERYBODY IN GOVERNMENT --
Jimmy: HE'S OBSESSED WITH IT --
TO PROVE IT TO HIM.
Jimmy: WHY IS HE SO OBSESSED WITH THIS? THERE'S OTHER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT.
IT'S WHO HE IS. HE HAS TO BE -- LOOK HOW HE BUILDS HIS BUILDINGS. IT HAS TO BE BIGGER THAN ANYBODY DOWN THE STREET. HE HAS TO PUT THE "T" ON EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON. THAT'S GOT HIM TO WHERE HE IS.
Jimmy: RIGHT.
PEOPLE LIKE THAT ABOUT HIM. BUT AT SOME POINT, I KNOW THAT REPUBLICANS ON THE HILL AND EVEN IN HIS STAFF ARE SAYING, "WE'VE GOT TO MOVE ON. WE'VE GOT TO MOVE ON AND DEAL WITH THE REAL PROBLEMS." SO IT'S GOING TO BE ROCK 'N' ROLL FOR A WHILE.
Jimmy: YEAH. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE FAKE NEWS THING, OR --
IT'S VERY TROUBLING. I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR SOME TIME THAT I THINK THE BIG GAME CHANGER, IN OUR BUSINESS, AND IN AMERICA ALTOGETHER, IS SOCIAL MEDIA. STUFF COMES OVER THE SCREEN, WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM, BUT IT'S VERY SOPHISTICATED. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE VERY CLEVER, THE PEOPLE WHO DOING IT AND A A LOT OF THEM HAVE A MISSION IN MIND, WHICH IS TO DISRUPT WHATEVER'S GOING ON. AND NOT JUST ON THE RIGHT, BUT ALSO ON THE LEFT. THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE SPINNING STORIES, THEY'RE TRYING TO GET YOU TO BELIEVE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING, AND SO MY ADVICE TO CONSUMERS IS, JIMMY, THAT YOU GOT TO LOOK AT SOMETHING AND APPLY THE SAME TEST TO IT THAT YOU WOULD TO A A FLAT SCREEN TELEVISION. AM I GOING TO BUY THAT ONE OR THIS ONE OR THAT ONE? AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN TRUST AFTER A WHILE. THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT OUT GOING ON NOW COMING IN FROM GOD KNOWS WHERE, TO TRY TO -- IN EFFECT, REALLY BECOME A A SABOTEUR OF THE TRUTH. AND THAT'S TROUBLING IN A FREE SOCIETY.
Jimmy: WOW. I WAS WATCHING THIS SPECIAL, THAT "FIRST 50 YEARS," AND ALL THE STUFF YOU'VE SEEN AND LIVED THROUGH, THROUGH NIXON, 9/11, THE BERLIN WALL. FASCINATING ESPECIALLY TO SEE. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED OR WHAT DO YOU TAKE AWAY FROM ALL THIS? IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU --
ONE OF THE THINGS I TAKE AWAY IS THAT THE WORLD IS CONSTANTLY IN MOTION, AND THEN WHEN I FIRST STARTED IN TELEVISION NEWS, WAS NBC IN 1966, THE PRINCIPLE OPPONENT WE HAD IN THE WORLD WAS THE SOVIET UNION. THE WORLD WAS REALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE SOVIET INFLUENCE AND THE WEST INFLUENCED BY AMERICA. AND CHINA WAS A BLANK SPOT ON THE MAP IN THOSE DAYS. IT WAS, MAO HAD A DARK, DARK COUNTRY. I WENT TO CHINA WHEN HE WAS STILL RUNNING THE PLACE. AND EVERYBODY WAS IN BLUE. THEY WOULDN'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. AND THEN THE SOVIET UNION STARTED TO COME APART, BECAUSE COULDN'T SUSTAIN THEIR WAY OF LIVING, AND IT'S NO LONGER THE SOVIET UNION. IT'S NOW A COLLECTION OF FORMER SATELLITES. VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD LIKE TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. CHINA, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING. LOOK HOW FAR THEY HAVE COME JUST IN THE LAST 50 YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN COVERING STORIES. THE BIG TEST FOR CHINA IS THIS. THEY HAVE 100 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS MOVING INTO CITIES. THEY ALL WANT CARS. THEY WANT UTILITIES. THEY WANT HOUSING. AND CHINA WANTS TO KEEP POLITICAL CONTROL OVER THEM, BUT EXPAND THE ECONOMY SO THEY CAN ACCOMMODATE ALL THAT. THAT'S A HISTORIC CHALLENGE, IT SEEMS TO ME, AND IT'S, IN A LOT OF WAYS, VERY EXCITING TO WATCH. SO WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR EYE ON THEM. PUTIN, YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE TALKING TO HIM. THINKS HE'S GOT KIND OF A A FRIEND IN HIM. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PUTIN'S ONLY INTERESTS IS TO ADVANCE HIS INTERESTS. NOT OURS.
Jimmy: AND HOW ABOUT -- WHAT ABOUT OUR COUNTRY? ANYTHING? ARE WE GOING TO BE OKAY? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] PLEASE TELL ME.
WELL,I KNOW. ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THAT. BACK WHEN I WAS DOING THIS, WHEN I WAS DOING THIS TWO-HOUR SPECIAL, THAT'S THE QUESTION EVERYBODY KEPT COMING -- OPRAH SAID, "ARE WE GOING TO BE OKAY?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I'M GLAD ASKED THE SAME QUESTION AS OPRAH.
AND THE FACT IS WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY. WE'RE A VERY STRONG COUNTRY. THE FACT IS THAT EVERYBODY THAT I ASK, LIKE BILL GATES, OR WARREN BUFFETT, OR OTHERS WHO ARE OUT THERE. AND THEY WOULD SAY, "LOOK, WE'RE STILL A GREAT COUNTRY." WE'VE GOT SO MANY MORE RESOURCES THAN ANYBODY ELSE. WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN COLLEGE THAN WE'VE EVER HAD BEFORE. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE, I THINK, IN THE COUNTRY IS, HOW DO WE GET EVERYBODY BACK TOGETHER? THERE'S A LOT OF UNEASINESS. AND THE WAY TO WORK THROUGH IT IS TO LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES AND SAY, "HOW DO WE FIND COMMON GROUND?" AND I -- I WISH WE'D SEE MORE OF THAT.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. HERE'S TO COMMON GROUND. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LET'S GET IT. I WANT TO SEE MORE OF YOU. I LOVE YOU. TOM BROKAW, EVERYONE.
