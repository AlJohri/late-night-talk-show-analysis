Jimmy: THAT'S A HOT CROWD. THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." YOU'RE HERE, THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HI. HEY. FUN, FUN, FUN. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. A BIG POLITICAL STORY. DURING A SPEECH IN KENTUCKY TODAY, SENATOR RAND PAUL BECAME THE SECOND MAJOR CANDIDATE TO OFFICIALLY JOIN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RACE IN ADDITION TO TED CRUZ. THAT'S RIGHT. THEY'RE THE ONLY TWO CANDIDATES RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH MEANS IF THE ELECTION WERE HELD TODAY, HILLARY WOULD STILL SOMEHOW WIN. I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW HOW, SHE'S NOT EVEN A CANDIDATE YET. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT. SPEAKING OF HILLARY, I READ THAT SHE ACTUALLY PLANS TO TRAVEL WITHOUT BILL AFTER SHE LAUNCHES HER CAMPAIGN. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY TRIED REACHING BILL FOR COMMENT, BUT HE WAS BUSY HIGH FIVING LITERALLY EVERYONE HE KNEW. [ AS CLINTON ] "I'M GOING TO HAVE A GREAT SUMMER. OH, MY GOODNESS. A WHOLE TWO MONTHS, COME ON." THAT'S RIGHT, RAND PAUL IS OFFICIALLY RUNNING. HE EVEN REVEALED HIS CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, WHICH IS, "DEFEAT THE WASHINGTON MACHINE, UNLEASH THE AMERICAN DREAM." YEAH, IT'S HARD TO TELL IF HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OR DOING AN INFOMERCIAL FOR BOWFLEX. [ LAUGHTER ] DEFEAT THE MACHINE AND UNLEASH THE DREAM. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE BEEN DEFEATING THE -- [ LAUGHTER ] IS THE DREAM UNLEASHED? YOU BET IT IS. THAT'S RIGHT, "DEFEAT THE WASHINGTON MACHINE, UNLEASH THE AMERICAN DREAM." THAT'S A GREAT SLOGAN. ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO COVER YOUR ENTIRE CAR BUMPER. I MEAN, IT'S THE LARGEST BUMPER STICKER EVER. THAT'S SOMETHING. SUPER BUMPER?
Steve: SUPER BUMPER.
Jimmy: SUPER BUMPER STICKER.
Steve: "DEFEAT THE WASHINGTON MACHINE --"
Jimmy: THAT'S CORRECT.
Steve: "-- UNLEASH THE AMERICAN DREAM."
Jimmy: YEAH.
Steve: ROLLS OFF THE TONGUE. [ LAUGHTER ] DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? THERE WAS A MASSIVE POWER OUTAGE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., TODAY. YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS? DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? IT AFFECTED A NUMBER OF THE FEDERAL BUILDINGS, INCLUDING THE WHITE HOUSE. WHEN ASKED WHEN THEY COULD RESTORE POWER TO THE WHITE HOUSE, OFFICIALS WERE LIKE "2016?" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, THE BLACKOUT AT THE WHITE HOUSE ONLY LASTED ABOUT 10 SECONDS. AND THEN OBAMA WAS LIKE, "IS EVERYONE OKAY? WHAT'S GOING ON? THE TRANSMITTER MUST HAVE BLOWN OR SOMETHING. SOMEBODY SMOKING IN HERE? GET OUT OF HERE, EVERYBODY." SOME MORE NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON. I SAW THE CIA RECENTLY TWEETED, "GOOD RIDDANCE, CARRIE MATHISON." AFTER IT WAS ANNOUNCED CLAIRE DANES' CHARACTER WAS LEAVING THE CIA IN THE NEXT SEASON OF "HOMELAND." IT'S A REAL TWEET FROM THE CIA. TAKE A LOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] THE CIA TWEETED THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED THE CIA WOULD HAVE SUCH A A STRONG OPINION ABOUT A TV CHARACTER. BUT IT TURNS OUT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF VOICING THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT TV SHOWS ON TWITTER. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY TWEETED, "NEWS FLASH, NOT EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. IN FACT, IT'S A FAIRLY TOXIC HOUSEHOLD."
Steve: WOW. WOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY ALSO TWEETED, "IF WE WANTED TO SEE PEOPLE DRINKING, SMOKING AND WOMANIZING, WE'D SKIP 'MAD MEN' AND HANG OUT WITH THE SECRET SERVICE. #YEAHWEWENTTHERE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: OH MY GOD.
Jimmy: HEY, WHOA. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING --
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: -- OVER AT THE TWEETING OFFICES THERE AT THE CIA. FINALLY, THEY TWEETED, "ROSS DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG TO RACHEL. #THEYWEREONABREAK. #BITCHESBECRAY." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHO'S DOING THIS?
Steve: WHO'S THE TWEETER?
Jimmy: GUYS, I WANT TO SAY CONGRATS TO THE DUKE BLUE DEVILS, WHO DEFEATED THE WISCONSIN BADGERS LAST NIGHT TO WIN THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. YEAH, IT WAS A TOUGH LOSS FOR WISCONSIN FANS, BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM LOOKED SADDER THAN THIS GUY. CHECK IT OUT.
AMAZING, WHAT HE'S BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THIS PROGRAM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT A GROWN MAN IN A TELETUBBY COSTUME COULDN'T GET ANY SADDER, THAT WENT AND HAPPENED. YOU KNOW HE WAS LIKE, "OH, GREAT, NOW I LOOK FOOLISH." [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT THE NEW HIGH SPEED ACTION MOVIE "FURIOUS 7." IT WAS THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE AT THE BOX OFFICE THIS PAST WEEKEND, MAKING $143 MILLION, WHICH IS THE BIGGEST APRIL OPENING EVER. EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THAT, AND THAT MEANS IT'S TIME FOR "THE FAN AND THE FURIOUS." THIS IS WHERE WE SEND OUR WRITER, ARTHUR, DOWN TO ROCKEFELLER PLAZA, AND ASK PEOPLE ABOUT "FURIOUS 7," AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DRIVING, BY GIVING THEM A A STEERING WHEEL AND RUNNING A A FAN AND A LEAF BLOWER IN FRONT OF THEIR FACES.

MEANWHILE, YOUR iPHONE JUST FELL TWO FEET INTO A PILE OF MARSHMALLOWS AND IS NOW COMPLETELY USELESS. LISTEN TO THIS, YOU GUYS. A NEW SURVEY FOUND THAT A A GROWING NUMBER OF MILLENNIALS WANT TO WORK FROM HOME AND GET MORE TIME OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY WOULD HAVE SAID MORE, BUT THEY HAD TO GO PICK UP THEIR GOLD STAR FOR PARTICIPATING IN THAT SURVEY. YOU DID IT. YOU DID A GREAT JOB. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY, THIS IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. I HEARD THAT A 100-YEAR-OLD WOMAN FROM JAPAN RECENTLY COMPLETED A 1,500 METER FREESTYLE SWIM IN JUST ONE HOUR AND 16 MINUTES. ONE OF THE SHARKS CIRCLING HER WAS LIKE, "DOES THIS STILL LOOK GOOD TO YOU?" [ LAUGHTER ] "I'LL WAIT, RIGHT? I'LL WAIT. I'LL EAT TOMORROW." [ LAUGHTER ] OH, YEAH, A LITTLE SHARK HUMOR. [ APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, STUDENTS WHO WRITE OUT THEIR CLASS NOTES INSTEAD OF TYPING THEM HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LESSONS.

Jimmy: OR JUST, YOU KNOW --
DON'T HURRY. DON'T HURRY IN LIFE.
Jimmy: THAT'S TRUE. I HAVE SOMETHING ON MY MIND.
ARE YOU OKAY?
Jimmy: WELL, NO, I'M THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING. BECAUSE I HEARD THIS THING BACKSTAGE. THEY SAID, "LOUIS WANTS TO ADD A STORY. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THIS." AND I GO, "WHAT?" AND THEY GO, "YOU AUDITIONED FOR LOUIS ONCE, YEARS AGO."
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND I GO, "I DON'T REMEMBER THIS THING." THEY GO, "WELL, HAVE A GOOD SHOW." AND THEN -- SO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S --
YOU AUDITIONED FOR ME. I WAS THE HEAD WRITER OF "THE DANA CARVEY SHOW," WHICH IS A A SHOW THAT WAS ON ABC BACK IN THE '90s.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT.

[ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU CAME IN AND AUDITIONED FOR US, ME AND ALL THE PRODUCERS WERE SITTING IN CHAIRS. AND YOU CAME IN AND YOU'RE PLAYING GUITAR, AND YOU HAD THESE LITTLE TROLL DOLLS AND YOU WERE SINGING SONGS ABOUT TROLL DOLLS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU WOULD SING -- YOU WERE KIND OF LIKE, "HEY, OKAY. HERE'S A SONG ABOUT TROLL DOLLS." AND YOU'RE SINGING AND THEN -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOUR IMPRESSION OF ME IS UNBELIEVABLE. I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU DO AN IMPRESSION. THAT'S WHY I'M HILARIOUSLY LAUGHING.
"YEAH. HERE'S A SONG BY A TROLL DOLL. IT'S A NEIL DIAMOND THING." OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW. YOU WOULD DO AN IMPRESSION.
Jimmy: NEIL DIAMOND?
I DON'T REMEMBER. AND THEN YOU WOULD TURN AROUND AND WIGGLE YOUR ASS A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE YOU WERE YOUNG AND YOU HAD A TIGHT LITTLE ASS. SO YOU'D WIGGLE IT AROUND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M JUST MAKING OBSERVATIONS. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEELINGS ABOUT IT. I'M JUST SAYING WHAT I SAW. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, SO YOU DID.

Jimmy: I DEFINITELY DID NOT DO THAT. BUT --
NO, YOU DID.
Jimmy: NO, I DEFINITELY DIDN'T DO THAT. BUT IF I DID --
WHY WOULD I SAY IT? WHY WOULD I SAY IT IF IT WASN'T TRUE?
Jimmy: MAYBE I DID IT ONCE AND IT STUCK IN YOUR BRAIN. YOU WANTED MORE, MORE, MORE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU COULDN'T GET IT. LEAVE THEM WANTING MORE. NO, BECAUSE I DO AN IMPRESSION OF GEORGE MICHAEL, AND I -- SO I DID TURN AROUND AND SHAKE MY BUTT. BUT I DIDN'T DO IT AFTER EVERY JOKE.
NOT AFTER EVERY JOKE. THE TRUTH LIES BETWEEN US SOMEWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SO HERE'S -- WHICH IS USUALLY THE CASE. BUT SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. SO THEN WE HAD OUR MEETING ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO BE ON THE SHOW. AND YOUR NAME CAME UP, AND ALL THE WOMEN IN THE STAFF ARE LIKE, "HE HAS TO BE ON. THAT GUY'S GOING TO BE A HUGE STAR." AND ME AND THIS GUY DINO, WHO'S A WRITER -- DINO STAMATOPOULOS ON THE SHOW -- WE'RE BOTH LIKE, "NEVER, NEVER HIM. NEVER HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] I WILL QUIT." I THINK I ACTUALLY SAID, "I WILL QUIT THE SHOW --"
Jimmy: WHAT?!
"--IF YOU HIRE THAT KID." ABSOLUTELY NOT. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
Jimmy: WHAT? NO WAY.
I WAS DEAD AGAINST YOU. YES, BECAUSE YOU HAD ALL YOUR HAIR, YOU WERE IN SHAPE, YOU WERE A YOUNG KID, AND I WAS ALREADY KIND OF JUST SWEATY AND BALDING, AND I WAS DEPRESSED AND -- PURE JEALOUSY. AND IN MY HEAD, I KNEW IT -- LIKE, THIS IS REALLY [ BLEEP ] UP TO BE DOING THIS. BECAUSE THIS KID IS REALLY TALENTED, BUT I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT HIM EVERY DAY, BECAUSE IT'LL MAKE ME UPSET ABOUT MYSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I TORPEDOED YOUR CHANCES TO HAVE -- AND I MEAN, I REALLY, REALLY WENT TO BAT AGAINST YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU DIDN'T GET THE SHOW.
Jimmy: I DID NOT GET THE SHOW.
IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU WERE INEVITABLE. YOU ARE A HUGE TALENT, YOU'RE A A SUPERBLY TALENTED KID. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND NO MATTER WHAT --
Jimmy: I APPRECIATE THAT.
IF YOU HAD GOTTEN THE SHOW, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE AIR NOW. AND YOU WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT OVER AT SOME POINT. IT WOULD BE "THE JIMMY FALLON AS DANA CARVEY SHOW." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOT SURE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT NOW, BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT, THOUGH. YOU SQUASHED MY DREAMS.
YES, I DID. FOR A MINUTE. BUT THAT JUST SHOWS, YOU KNOW? NOBODY CAN REALLY HURT YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] I TOOK THAT THING AWAY FROM YOU. I TOOK SOMETHING AWAY FROM YOU.
Jimmy: YOU DID.
YEAH, AND LOOK AT YOU NOW.
Jimmy: YOU WANT ME TO THANK YOU? [ LAUGHTER ]
NO. I KIND OF DO, YEAH. EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN YOUR PAST LEADS TO WHERE YOU ARE, RIGHT? SO IF YOU GOT "THE DANA CARVEY SHOW" -- BY THE WAY, WE DID GET CANCELLED AFTER SEVEN EPISODES, AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN IN SOME DITCH. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: ARLENE AND HARLAN.
AND THEY WOULD TAKE THE CRUMPLED DEPRESSING BILLS AND WE WOULD SPLIT THEM UP. THEY WOULD GIVE SOME TO THE COMEDIAN AND THEY'D TAKE SOME HOME.
Jimmy: DO REMEMBER GETTING -- I JUST DID THIS THING WITH SEINFELD, "THE COMEDIANS IN CARS."
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND WHEN WE WERE FINISHED DOING IT, IT WAS A A REALLY FUN DAY, AND AT THE END HE GAVE ME AN ENVELOPE FULL OF CASH.
YEAH, HE PAYS YOU, BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT THAT FELT LIKE BECAUSE JERRY WENT THROUGH THIS TOO.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND I GO, "I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY, MAN, LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS FOR?" HE'S LIKE, "DON'T YOU REMEMBER?" I WON'T DO THE IMPRESSION BUT, "DON'T YOU REMEMBER?"
"DON'T, DON'T YOU REMEMBER?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE DOING IT TOO.
"WHAT, JIMMY?"
Jimmy: YOU SHAKE YOUR BUTT, THAT'S A FUNNY JOKE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME MONEY? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S SO WEIRD. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY ME."
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. BUT YOU WOULD DO -- THAT'S A A GOOD IMPRESSION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
Jimmy: HE'S GOT THIS MONEY AND WHEN --
YEAH.
Jimmy: HE GOES, "REMEMBER AFTER YOU WORKED HARD FOR A A WHOLE WEEK AND YOU SOLD OUT THE SHOWS, I MEAN, YOU REMEMBER THOSE DAYS."
THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE USUALLY AS A COMIC, YOU GET PAID LIKE WHATEVER THEY WANT TO GIVE YOU, YOU KNOW? LIKE THEY SAY, "YOU'RE GOING TO DO EIGHT SHOWS AND WE'LL GIVE YOU $800." AND YOUR LIKE, "THAT'S NOT A A LOT OF MONEY." AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WE'LL GET SOMEBODY ELSE." THEY DON'T CARE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO, BUT I REMEMBER THE FIRST NIGHT I GOT REAL MONEY. I WORKED AT A PLACE IN MINNEAPOLIS CALLED THE "ACME COMEDY CLUB," RUN BY A GUY NAMED LOUIS LEE, AND IT WAS A A CLUB I HAD WORKED AT A LOT. AND IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE HALF FULL, YOU KNOW, AND YOU POUR YOUR HEART INTO THESE SHOWS, AND THEN THEY GIVE YOU LIKE 800 BUCKS MAYBE 1,000. AND THEN YOU GO ON TO THE NEXT PLACE. IT'S SAD LIFE, YOU KNOW? BUT THIS ONE WEEK I SOLD THE PLACE OUT, I PACKED EVERY SHOW, AND I HAD NEVER REALLY DONE THAT BEFORE. AND AT THE END OF THE WEEK, LOUIS HANDED ME AN ENVELOPE WITH $10,000 IN IT. AND HE SAID, "THIS IS YOURS." I SAID, "WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME THIS?" HE SAID, "IT'S YOUR MONEY. YOU BROUGHT THE PEOPLE IN. THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE AT NOW. THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU SHOULD BE MAKING A WEEK." AND HE GAVE THAT TO ME AND I JUST STARTED CRYING LIKE A A BABY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
'CAUSE I GOT $10,000 FOR TELLING JOKES, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YOU NEVER FORGET THOSE, MAN. IT'S AMAZING THAT YOU REMEMBER.
SO YEAH. SO THAT'S WHY, I MEAN, MY SHOW, I'M NOT SUCCESSFUL, ON MY SERIES. I PLAY ME WITH NO SUCCESS. AND IT'S A FANTASY, BECAUSE I MISS IT, I MISS STRUGGLING, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YOU REALLY DO, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
'CAUSE YOU DON'T GET THAT BACK.
Jimmy: YOU NEVER DO.
NO, NOW WE'RE HERE, AND WE'RE ON TV, AND YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YOU'RE FORCED TO TALK TO ME.
YEAH. I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.
Jimmy: NORMALLY YOU WOULDN'T BE.
NOW IT'S ONCE YOU GET TO A A CERTAIN POINT YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE. YOU CAN'T GET THOSE DAYS BACK WHERE YOU'RE, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO GET AN APPLE PIE OUT OF A A VENDING MACHINE ON ROUTE 40 IN HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S SO SPECIFIC. OH, MY GOD.
I REMEMBER EVERY SINGLE THING. I REMEMBER A FEW THINGS EXACTLY. I REMEMBER MY DAUGHTER BEING BORN, I REMEMBER MY DAD SPANKING ME AND I REMEMBER WORKING AT "RUMORS COMEDY CLUB" IN WINNIPEG. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE ONLY THREE THINGS BY YOUR MEMORY.
THE THREE THINGS I REMEMBER REALLY VIVIDLY.
Jimmy: GOD, THAT'S WHY --
THE TWO WORST AND BEST THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN MY LIFE.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHY I THINK WE LOVE THE SHOW. AND THERE ARE THOSE PEOPLE THAT LOVE THEIR SHOW BECAUSE IT'S SO SPECIFIC AND --
THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE.
Jimmy: OH, MAN.

Jimmy: IT'S SO FUN, EVERYBODY.

IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY.
Jimmy: STOP, DON'T --

Jimmy: IT IS FOR EVERYBODY.
NO, IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY.
Jimmy: HOW DO THEY KNOW?
