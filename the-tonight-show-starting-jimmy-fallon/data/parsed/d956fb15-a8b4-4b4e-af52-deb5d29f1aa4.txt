NO. IN A NICE POT AND HOMEMADE, I LOVE COOKING, AND I LOVE MUSHROOM SOUP, BUT THE TWIST WAS, IS IT PSYCHEDELIC OR NOT? [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I WAS LIKE, MAYBE --
Jimmy: LIKE SHOULD BE MUSHROOMS?
MAYBE THERE'S PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS IN HERE, MAYBE NOT.
Jimmy: YOU MIGHT BE GIVING THEM DRUGS. YEAH, WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
YEAH WE DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: UNTIL YOU EAT THE SOUP.
SO THE GUY THAT WON IT LAST YEAR, HE CAME UP TO ME, AND HE SAID, "THAT MUSHROOM SOUP, MAN, I HAD THE CRAZIEST TRIP." NOW, I DIDN'T PUT PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS IN THE SOUP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT YOU MADE HIM THINK THAT.
HE WAS LIKE, "IT WAS AMAZING."
Jimmy: DID YOU LIKE ELEVEN MADISON. I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE. THAT PLACE IS THE BEST.
IT WAS DELICIOUS. BUT WHAT I WANTED AT THE PARTY, AND I ACTUALLY GOT IT, IT WAS A A GIANT CARROT BODY PILLOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS GETTING WEIRDER. I HAVE A PICTURE OF YOU ACTUALLY HUGGING IT.
OH, LOOK, THERE'S A PHOTO RIGHT THERE.
