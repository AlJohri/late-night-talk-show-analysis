Questlove: 310, L.A.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE! THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HOT CROWD! LOOKING GOOD TONIGHT! HOT CROWD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THAT'S IT. WE'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE. THIS IS IT. WE'RE DOING IT TOGETHER. WELL, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. YESTERDAY, YOU SEE, HILLARY CLINTON ANNOUNCED A NEW PLAN TO MAKE EDUCATION MORE AFFORDABLE, CALLED THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT. YEAH. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, DONALD TRUMP CAME UP WITH HIS OWN AFFORDABLE COLLEGE TUITION PLAN CALLED "CHICKS GET IN FREE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED? THAT'S RIGHT. HILLARY HAS A $350 BILLION PLAN THAT SHE SAYS WILL MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE. WHICH HAS TO BE BETTER THAN MY PARENTS' PLAN TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE, BE GOOD AT SPORTS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THEY GO, "NO. JIMMY, DON'T RUN FROM THE BALL." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S TOO -- I SAID, "IT'S TOO COLD OUT HERE, MOMMY. [ LAUGHTER ] SOMEONE WAS THROWING THE BALL AT ME. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO CHANGE MY OVERALLS." [ LAUGHTER ] GET THIS. I READ THAT A SUPER PAC SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON JUST RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS DONATION OF $1 MILLION. WHICH MEANS IF SHE WINS ANY OF US CAN SAY THAT IT WAS US THAT GAVE HER THE MILLION BUCKS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HIT HER UP FOR A FAVOR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GO, "HEY, I WANT STAY IN THE LINCOLN BEDROOM. IT WAS ME. I GAVE THAT YOU MILLION BUCKS." [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING HERE IS THAT THIS MILLION-DOLLAR DONATION FROM AN ANONYMOUS DONOR CAME JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER HILLARY SPOKE OUT AGAINST, "THE ENDLESS FLOW OF SECRET UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY INTO CAMPAIGNS." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN SHE SAID, "THAT'S STARTING -- NOW. NOW, NOW, NOW WE CAN DO IT. UNATTAINABLE MONEY IS AWFUL. CASH IT. CASH IT, QUICK." [ LAUGHTER ] IN AN INTERVIEW LAST WEEKEND, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLY FIORINA SAID THAT SHE IS ACTUALLY OPPOSED TO MAKING COMPANIES OFFER PAID MATERNITY LEAVE. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, DONALD TRUMP SAID WHEN HE'S PRESIDENT HE'LL ACTUALLY PUT THE BABIES TO WORK. [ LAUGHTER ] "START YOU IN THE MAIL ROOM. VERY EASY. NO THUMB-SUCKING UNTIL IT'S YOUR BREAK TIME." [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, ACCORDING TO AN ONLINE POLL, DONALD TRUMP IS STILL THE FRONT RUNNER IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY RACE. THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE 'CAUSE IT'S THE ONLY RACE LEFT THAT HE HASN'T OFFENDED YET. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. SO AFTER THE CONTROVERSY OVER DONALD TRUMP'S INSULTS TOWARD DEBATE MODERATOR MEGYN KELLY, TRUMP SAID YESTERDAY THAT KELLY SHOULD ACTUALLY APOLOGIZE TO HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN MEGYN KELLY HEARD THAT, SHE WAS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, GOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS A CRAZY STORY HERE. A MICHIGAN STATE REPRESENTATIVE NAMED TODD COURSER IS CLAIMING THAT HE INTENTIONALLY LEAKED A A FAKE NEWS STORY ABOUT HIMSELF HIRING A MALE PROSTITUTE TO EXPOSE -- HE DID THIS. TO EXPOSE PEOPLE BLACKMAILING HIM OVER A REAL AFFAIR HE WAS HAVING WITH A WOMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HIS WIFE WAS LIKE, "GOT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, WE'RE STILL GETTING, LIKE, SUPER DIVORCED. I MEAN -- THAT WAS YOUR IDEA?" OH, I'VE GOT A GOOD PLAN. [ LAUGHTER ] UH, I WASN'T HAVING AN AFFAIR. I WAS ACTUALLY HIRING A MALE PROSTITUTE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HAVE YOU READ THE PAPERS THIS MORNING?
Jimmy: CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING MALE PROSTITUTES? [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: IT'S ALL THE RAGE.
Jimmy: I WAS JUST KIDDING, HONEY. I WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A A WOMAN.
Steve: OH, GOOD.
Jimmy: OH, IT'S OKAY NOW, HONEY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THAT'S MUCH EASIER, YEAH.
Steve: JEEZ.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF THIS -- THIS IS KIND OF COOL. I LOVE, YOU KNOW, I LOVE MY FORD TRUCK.
Steve: YEAH, YOU LOVE IT.
Jimmy: THAT'S MY JAM, RIGHT THERE.
Steve: HOW BIG IS IT?
Jimmy: WHAT'S THAT?
Steve: HOW BIG IS YOUR FORD TRUCK?
Jimmy: IT'S BIG ENOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. SO I'M ALL INTO THIS NEW THING. SO FORD APPARENTLY HAS INTRODUCED NEW SEATS FOR A A LUXURY SEDAN THAT ALLOWS DRIVERS TO USE INDIVIDUAL SETTINGS FOR EACH BUTT CHEEK. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IF YOU CAN AFFORD THAT NEW LUXURY CAR, MAYBE YOU SHOULD ALSO PAY A DOCTOR TO LOOK AT YOUR MISMATCHED BUTT CHEEKS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, NO TWO BUTT CHEEKS ARE THE SAME. [ LAUGHTER ] BY THE WAY, I HAD AN AFFAIR WITH A MALE PROSTITUTE. SAME VOICE. SAME VOICE.
Steve: OH?
Jimmy: I HAVE TWO VOICES, SORRY. HERE'S A LOCAL STORY HERE. THE SUBWAY SYSTEM HERE IN NEW YORK CITY IS FIGHTING ITS GARBAGE PROBLEM BY GETTING RID OF TRASH CANS IN SUBWAY STATIONS. THAT MAY SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE, BUT SO FAR THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE. HERE TO TELL US ABOUT SOME MORE UPCOMING PLANS IS A SPOKESMAN FOR NEW YORK MAYOR, BILL DE BLASIO, PHIL WALZACK. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE PHIL.
THANK YOU, JIMMY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NOW PHIL, EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT REMOVING TRASH CANS FROM SUBWAY STATIONS HAS DONE.
WELL, IT'S CAUSED A A REDUCTION IN TRASH VOLUME, TRACK FIRES, AND RODENT ACTIVITY. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE OUR BRAND NEW PLAN FOR THE ENTIRE CITY OF NEW YORK, GET RID OF ALL TRASH CANS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, EXACTLY?
JUST WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. THERE WILL NO LONGER BE TRASH CANS IN NEW YORK CITY. LIKE, ANYWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT PEOPLE WILL STILL BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM IN THEIR APARTMENTS, RIGHT?
WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ] NO TRASH CANS. END OF STORY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO WHERE WILL PEOPLE PUT THEIR TRASH?
INTO SMALL BOXES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY. AND WHERE WILL THEY PUT THEIR SMALL BOXES?
INTO LARGER BOXES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND WHERE WILL THOSE LARGER BOXES GO?
INTO EVEN LARGER BOXES.
Jimmy: AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE BOXES?
NO TRASH CANS. END OF STORY.
Jimmy: STOP SHOWING THAT BORING GRAPHIC. PHIL, IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS SOME SORT OF RUSSIAN NESTING DOLL, BUT WITH TRASH.
WELL, WE PREFER TO THINK OF IT MORE AS THOSE SETS OF WOODEN DOLLS OF DECREASING SIZE PLACED INSIDE EACH OTHER, BUT WITH TRASH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, LIKE I SAID, RUSSIAN NESTING DOLLS.
OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE CALLED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LOOK, I'M GOING TO BE HONEST YOU HERE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS GOING TO LIKE THIS PLAN.
WELL, I THINK THEY JUST MIGHT LIKE IT, ONCE THEY HEAR THE TRASH SONG. HIT IT! ♪♪ ♪ IF YOU'VE GOT TO THROW YOUR TRASH AWAY GET A BOX ♪ ♪ IF YOU'VE GOT TO THROW THAT BOX AWAY GET ANOTHER BOX ♪ ♪ IF YOU'VE GOT TO THROW THAT BOX AWAY GET A BIGGER BOX ♪ ♪ AND THAT'S HOW YOU SING THE TRASH SONG ♪
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: NO IT WAS A REMOTE.
Jimmy: HE WAS VIA SATELLITE. GET OUT OF WHERE YOU ARE. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN WE WROTE THAT. YEAH, WE SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN THE LINE DIFFERENT. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] GET OUT OF THERE, PHIL.
Steve: YEAH. WHEREVER YOU ARE, VIA SATELLITE, NOT HERE IN THE STUDIO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: TURN OFF YOUR SATELLITE FEED.
Jimmy: GET OUT OF WHERE YOU ARE LOCATED, YEAH.
Steve: BUT THE MALE PROSTITUTE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS PRETTY COOL. HONEY, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS THING HAPPENED.
Steve: THAT'S NOT TRUE IN THE PAPERS.
Jimmy: I THOUGHT IT WAS ON TWITTER. SO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK I WAS DOING. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT A MALE PROSTITUTE.

"SHOW ME A HERO", WRITTEN BY DAVID SIMON WHO'S ONE OF THE BEST WRITERS IN TELEVISON.
Jimmy: I MEAN "THE WIRE"!
YEAH, "THE WIRE." AND PAUL HAGGIS, OF COURSE, A A GREAT --
Jimmy: "CRASH."
ACADEMY AWARD DIRECTOR.
Jimmy: HE'S AN AMAZING DIRECTOR.
GREAT CAST.
Jimmy: OSCAR ISAAC, WHO'S MY MAN.
HE NAILS THIS ROLE.
Jimmy: DID YOU SEE "EX MACHINA"?
HE WAS -- HE'S CRAZY GOOD.
Jimmy: I THOUGHT IT WAS "EX MACHINA." [ LAUGHTER ] NO, "EX MACHINA." HE'S FANTASTIC.
WINONA RYDER'S IN IT. SOME GREAT CAST MEMBERS.
Jimmy: ANYWAYS, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIVE INTO IT, GET INTO IT. SET IN A SMALL TOWN --
YONKERS. [ SCATTERED CHEERS ] IT'S A TRUE STORY THAT HAPPENED IN THE EARLY '80s.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'LL REMEMBER.
THERE'S ONE YONKERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THEY MULTIPLY DURING THE NIGHT. BY THE NED OF THE NIGHT, THERE'S GONNA BE TWO YONKERS.
AND THEN THEY BECOME HONKERS.
Jimmy: IT GETS REALLY CRAZY. YEAH, IT GETS CRAZY AFTER A A WHILE.
IT'S A TRUE STORY THAT HAPPENED IN THE MID '80s, ABOUT HOW YONKERS WAS SUED BY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR NOT TAKING CARE OF THEIR HOUSING PROJECTS. SO IT'S A VERY, VERY GOOD STORY. AND THE STORY-TELLING THAT PAUL AND DAVID DO IS AMAZING. CAN'T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF IT.
Jimmy: I CANNOT WAIT. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE IS JIM BELUSHI AS THE MAYOR RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION IN HBO'S "SHOW ME A HERO." THIS SUNDAY.
ANGELO, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF OPPOSITION TO THE HOUSING INITIATIVE.
WELL, THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I THINK THAT BY AND LARGE, PEOPLE OF YONKERS UNDERSTAND THAT A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS RULED AND THE CITY MUST NOW COMPLY WITH THE LAW.
NICK WASICSKO IS A A FIRST-TERM COUNCILMAN. DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH OF A A RACE, DOES IT?
I EXPECT A QUIET CAMPAIGN. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, LISTEN, I SAY SO BECAUSE MY OPPONENT HAS VOTED WITH ME ON MOST ISSUES. BUT NICK -- NICK'S A SMART GUY WITH A LOT OF PROMISE. SO I AM TAKING NOTHING FOR GRANTED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
