Questlove: 568!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S A HOT CROWD! ELECTRIC! ELECTRIC CROWD TONIGHT! WELCOME, EVERYBODY! WELCOME! WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT WAS A BUSY DAY TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA HOSTING THE NBA CHAMPIONS, THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS, AS WELL AS PRESIDENT-ELECT, DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] IT ACTUALLY GOT A LITTLE AWKWARD WHEN TRUMP WALKED UP TO LeBRON AND SAID, "NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. PRESIDENT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND YOU GO, "NO, THAT'S --" NO, DONALD, DONALD "YOU'RE MUCH TALLER IN PERSON." AND WHILE PRESIDENT OBAMA MET WITH DONALD TRUMP, MICHELLE OBAMA MET PRIVATELY WITH MELANIA TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] MICHELLE SAID, "IT'S A PLEASURE TO WELCOME YOU AND DONALD TO THE WHITE HOUSE." MELANIA SAID, "IT IS A PLEASURE TO WELCOME YOU AND DONALD TO THE WHITE HOUSE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "STOP COPYING ME." "STOP COPYING ME." "SERIOUSLY." "SERIOUSLY." SO, MICHELLE ACTUALLY HAD A A NICE TIME SHOWING MELANIA AROUND, ALTHOUGH IT GOT WEIRD WHEN THEY WALKED INTO THE LINCOLN BEDROOM AND MELANIA SAID, "WOW, WHAT A LOVELY CLOSET." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "A BEDROOM." OH, FORGET IT. GET THIS. THERE'S TALK THAT DONALD TRUMP MAY APPOINT SARAH PALIN AS SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, WHICH MEANS SHE WOULD OVERSEE THE NATIONAL PARKS SERVICE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN THEY HEARD THAT, BEARS WERE LIKE, "WELL, WE HAD A GOOD RUN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OH, BOY. OH, YOU GOT A BEAR? YOU STILL GOT A BEAR.
Steve: LET'S GO, YOGI!
Jimmy: OF COURSE, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE ELECTION. IN FACT, THERE WERE LARGE ANTI-TRUMP PROTESTS IN THE STREETS OF AT LEAST SEVEN CITIES LAST NIGHT, INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK. [ CHEERS ] TRUMP LOOKED OUT HIS WINDOW FROM 60 STORIES UP AND SAID, "A PARADE ALREADY? THAT'S FANTASTIC. THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S NOT A PARADE. ON THE OTHER HAND, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN GAVE A A SPEECH YESTERDAY IN WHICH HE CONGRATULATED DONALD TRUMP, AND HE SOUNDED PRETTY EXCITED. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE SNUCK THAT IN THERE.
Steve: RIGHT?
Jimmy: A SUBTLE HINT, A A SUBTLE HINT FOR CHRISTMAS.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: THINGS HAVE BEEN PRETTY TENSE, THOUGH, BUT WITH TRUMP WINNING THE ELECTION, THE STOCK MARKET HAS BEEN GOING UP AND DOWN A LOT LATELY. LET'S SEE EXACTLY IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MARKET WENT UP WHEN TRUMP MET WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. THE MARKET WENT DOWN WHEN TRUMP ASKED OBAMA TO CHANGE THE NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODE TO 1234. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S EASIER TO REMEMBER. LATER, THE MARKET WENT DOWN WHEN TRUMP ANNOUNCED HE'S GETTING RID OF OBAMACARE. THE MARKET WENT UP WHEN TRUMP SIMPLY ASSURED EVERYONE THAT HE REPLACED IT WITH "SOMETHING TERRIFIC." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, THE MARKET WENT UP WHEN DONALD TRUMP FLEW TO WASHINGTON, D.C. ON HIS OWN PLANE. THE MARKET WENT DOWN WHEN TRUMP MADE THE PILOT LAND IN THE HUDSON RIVER TO SEE IF SULLY WAS REAL OR NOT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, IT WAS REAL! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? STARBUCKS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THE RED HOLIDAY CUPS ARE COMING BACK THIS YEAR, AND WILL HAVE 13 DIFFERENT DESIGNS.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: YEAH. WE'VE GOT A FEW THAT WE CAN DEBUT TONIGHT.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: YOU WANT --

Steve: JUST A FEW. HOW MANY YOU GOT?
Jimmy: WELL, YOU HAVE THE CLASSIC STARBUCKS, CLASSICS LIKE THE BARISTA TEXTING WHILE YOU ORDER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: OH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE ALSO HAVE THE LADY POURING THREE INCHES OF COFFEE INTO THE TRASH CAN SO SHE CAN ADD WHOLE MILK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "IT'S TOO MUCH COFFEE! I SAID ROOM FOR MILK!" ONE MORE. WE HAVE THE GUY CARRYING BATHROOM KEY ATTACHED TO EMBARRASSINGLY LARGE PIECE OF WOOD WITH "TOILET" WRITTEN ON IT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, DON'T MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A FOOL." AND FINALLY, THIS IS GOING AROUND THE INTERNET TODAY. IT JUST MADE ME SMILE. IT'S THIS WOMAN WHO WAS IN THE CROWD LAST NIGHT AT A A GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS GAME. YOU KNOW, AND THE CAMERA GOES ON TO YOU TO WATCH YOU DANCE. IT LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS HAVING A A PRETTY GOOD TIME. CHECK THIS OUT. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

HE'S ALSO THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK CALLED "LUCKY BASTARD: MY LIFE, MY DAD, AND THE THINGS I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SAY ON TV." PLEASE WELCOME A MAN AT THE TOP OF HIS PROFESSION, JOE BUCK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: JOE BUCK! HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK TO THE SHOW AND THANK YOU FOR -- I MEAN, CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS BOOK. WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THIS. I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS ALSO TO -- TO JUST WHAT A GREAT GAME AND YOU CALLED IT SO PERFECTLY, THE WORLD SERIES, THE CHICAGO CUBS AND YOU DID IT, JUST EVERYONE, JUST RAVE REVIEWS. THEY JUST LOVE YOU.
WELL, NO, UNLESS YOU'RE ON TWITTER. THEN THERE'S NO RAVE REVIEWS. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DON'T WORRY ABOUT TWITTER.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IT WAS THE 19th ONE I'VE DONE SO I HAVE BEEN A LUCKY BASTARD TO DO ALL THESE GAMES BUT TO DO A WORLD SERIES THAT HAD THE CUBS AND THE INDIANS, TWO TEAMS THAT HADN'T WON FOR A COMBINED 176 YEARS. THEN YOU GET SEVEN GAMES, WHICH IS A GIFT. THEN YOU GET TEN INNINGS OF THE SEVENTH GAME AND EVERYTHING'S HANGING ON ONE PITCH. IT'S INTENSE.
Jimmy: YOU POSTED THIS SCORE SHEET FROM A FUN GAME ONCE. THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHILE THE GAME'S BEING PLAYED. THAT'S INSANE.
WELL, YEAH.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF THIS MEANS.
THERE'S A TINGE OF INSANITY THERE. THAT'S HOW I HAVE TO KEEP SCORE DURING THE COURSE OF THE GAME SO THERE'S A LOT OF -- YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: LOT GOING ON IN YOUR MIND.
LOT GOING ON.
Jimmy: I FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THIS ONCE. I THINK I DID THIS ONCE WHEN I WAS A KID.
IT'S KIND OF A LOST ART, THE WHOLE IDEA OF SCORING A GAME IS A LOST ART BUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW OVER THE YEARS, EDDIE VEDDER, WHO'S OBVIOUSLY CUBS FAN NUMBER ONE, SITS AT HOME FOR CUB GAMES ON TV AND SCORES A GAME WATCHING ON TELEVISION. THAT'S HOW NUTS EDDIE VEDDER IS.
Jimmy: DOES HE REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: WOW. [ APPLAUSE ]
I MEAN, THAT'S A LEGIT FAN. YOU GOT TO BE A LITTLE KOOKY.
Jimmy: IT'S A THREE RUN HOMER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DO THE GAMES, GOING FANTASTIC. I LOVE IT. AND THEN COMES THE RAIN DELAY.
THE RAIN DELAY.
Jimmy: AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THAT'S WHERE I WOULD FREAK OUT. THAT'S WHERE I WOULD NOT BE HIRED BACK BECAUSE I WOULD JUST BE LIKE, "I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS TO HAPPEN."
YEAH, YOU SAY THAT. YOU SIT OUT HERE AND ENTERTAIN EVERY NIGHT. THAT'S KIND OF THE FUN TIME, RIGHT? EVERY TIME YOU'RE ON CAMERA, IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE IN A TRACK MEET TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION OUT AND THEN EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE GAME. I GET IT. WE GET IT.
Jimmy: BUT ONCE A SAW A RAIN DELAY ONCE FOR GOLF, WHICH -- [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S LIKE, IT'S ALMOST REDUNDANT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, AND IT WAS THE GREAT -- IT WAS BOB COSTAS, WHO WAS THE MASTER, AND HE WAS OUT AND HE WAS -- HE TALKED FOR LIKE FOUR HOURS ABOUT NOTHING.
NOTHING.
Jimmy: AND IT WAS REALLY -- YOU COULD TELL --
IT'S AN ART.
Jimmy: HIS VOICE WAS GETTING LIKE RASPY. "LIKE, ANYWAY, ONE TIME I HAD A A PIZZA ONCE."
RIGHT.
Jimmy: AWFUL. BUT IT WAS LIKE, YOU HAVE TO KILL TIME. OF COURSE IT WASN'T. HE WAS FANTASTIC THOUGH. BUT I WOULD BE NERVOUS.
IT'S A LITTLE BIT INTIMIDATING BECAUSE YOU KNOW 40 MILLION PEOPLE ARE HOPING TO SEE THE END OF THIS GAME AND YOU'VE GOT TO KIND OF LIE A A LITTLE BIT AND GO, WELL, IT'S STOPPED RAINING, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO PULL THE TARP OFF HERE SOON AND EVENTUALLY YOU GET BACK TO BASEBALL. THANK GOD IT WAS ONLY 17 MINUTES AND YOU COULD DO IT. YOU COULD DO 17 MINUTES. FOUR HOURS, YOU COULDN'T DO. I COULDN'T DO. ONLY COSTAS.
Jimmy: ONLY COSTAS CAN DO THAT. YOU SAY, THEY'RE PULLING THE TARP BACK OFF AND YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE NOT EVEN GOING NEAR THE TARP. THAT TARP'S NOT COMING OFF.
YEAH. IT'S POURING.
Jimmy: PEOPLE ARE DOING SLIP AND SLIDES INTO FIRST BASE. YEAH.
STAY WITH US ON FOX.
Jimmy: TALK TO ME ABOUT "LUCKY BASTARD." YOU WROTE A BOOK.
LOOK, I DID. LOOK AT THAT!
Jimmy: NOT LIKE THAT. I MEANT LIKE --
WHOA. JOE WROTE A BOOK.
Jimmy: NOT LIKE THAT. I'M HAPPY YOU WROTE A BOOK. WHY DID YOU WRITE A BOOK? WHY NOW?
JUST TO PUT A LITTLE PERSONALITY BEHIND THE WHOLE -- I MEAN, LOOK, LET'S BE HONEST. YOU DON'T WANT ANY SPORTS PERSON SITTING OUT HERE. THEY'RE BORING. SPORTS PEOPLE ARE BORING.
Jimmy: NO.
OKAY. BUT LET'S BE HONEST.
Jimmy: I'VE HAD YOU ON BEFORE.
I'M A SPORTS ANNOUNCER. YEAH, I WAS ON IN 2011, THAT'S WHEN I HAD A PARALYZED VOCAL CORD.
Jimmy: YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW THIS.
WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT A A LITTLE BIT BUT I KIND OF LIED. WHAT I DID WAS I GOT HAIR TRANSPLANT SURGERY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HOW DARE YOU LAUGH AT ME! SO, I HAD ALL THESE HAIR PLUG SURGERIES AND THE LAST ONE I HAD, I WENT UNDER A GENERAL ANESTHETIC. WHEN I WOKE UP, THEY HAD MISPLACED A CUP ON MY LARYNGEAL NERVE AND IT SHUT DOWN MY VOCAL CORD. SO, I SOUNDED LIKE I WAS BABE RUTH GIVING HIS LAST SPEECH, DYING, EVERY TIME I OPENED MY MOUTH AND WHEN I WAS ON YOUR SHOW, THAT WAS RIGHT BEFORE THE ALL-STAR GAME, I WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR, DEPRESSION, TRYING TO FAKE MY WAY THROUGH IT, TELLING ALL THE WHILE EVERYBODY THAT I WAS SUFFERING FROM A VIRUS WHEN, IN ACTUALITY -- IS IT HARD TO LOOK AT ME IN THE EYES RIGHT NOW? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LOOK AT ME IN THE EYES. LOOK AT ME IN THE EYES. NO, I'M OVER HERE.
Jimmy: OKAY. I'M OVER HERE.
Jimmy: THIS IS GOOD.
DO NOT LOOK AT MY HAIR.
Jimmy: I CAN'T DO IT. I HAD TO LOOK. I HAD A QUICK PEEK. I HAD A QUICK PEEK. AND I GOT TO SAY, NOT BAD. NOT BAD. BUT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WAS GOING ON? BECAUSE WE SANG JOHNNY CASH.
WE DID. WE KIND OF LED INTO THE WHOLE THING TO TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF OUR CREW.
Jimmy: I HAD NO IDEA AT ALL. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THIS AT ALL.
YEAH, WELL, I SUCKED. IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST GUESTS YOU'VE PROBABLY HAD. IN WHAT, 20-25 YEARS YOU'VE DONE THIS?
Jimmy: 25 YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT EVERYTHING'S LOOKING GOOD NOW.
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, GOT A LITTLE FRESH SOD ON TOP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE HAVE A MICROPHONE.
I WROTE A BOOK.
Jimmy: YOU WROTE A BOOK. WE HAVE A MICROPHONE THAT AMY ADAMS LEFT BACK IF YOU WANT TO TRY JOHNNY CASH AGAIN.
OH, JIMMY, I COULDN'T. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I KNOW AMERICA'S BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT. YOU'RE A TRUE PATRIOT FOR LETTING AMERICA HEAR ME SING FULL VOICE.
Jimmy: GO FOR IT.
