Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN NEVER WATCHING RECORDINGS OF YOURSELF DANCING. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT ALL LIVES IN YOUR MIND, AND YOU'RE LIKE, "NAILED THAT!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. DID YOU GROW UP -- DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL OR TRAINING FOR ACTING AND SINGING AND DANCING?
I DID. I WENT TO SCHOOL. I WENT TO CAL ARTS, AMAZING COLLEGE.
Jimmy: HELLO.
BUT BEFORE ANY OF THAT, I USED TO -- I MEAN, MY MOM -- MY PARENTS REALIZED VERY EARLY THAT I WANTED TO DO THAT KIND OF STUFF, SO I USED TO DO CHILDREN'S THEATER.
Jimmy: REALLY?
IN LOS FELIZ, CALIFORNIA, YEAH. AT THE JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER. OH, ONE PERSON, WOO! LOS FELIZ! [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU WEREN'T THERE. YOU WEREN'T THERE.
YOU WERE THERE! YOU WERE THERE. I RECOGNIZE YOU!
Jimmy: HOW WAS THAT? HOW DID -- BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANY THEATER OR ANYTHING GROWING UP.
OH, IT WAS GREAT. WE DID ALL THE DISNEY CLASSICS, "SNOW WHITE," "CINDERELLA." WE DID "THE WIZARD OF OZ." BUT THEY WOULD NEVER GET THE RIGHTS TO -- SO THEY WOULD REWRITE THEM COMPLETELY, AND THEN THEY WOULD REWRITE ALL THE MUSIC. AND IT WAS GREAT, BECAUSE EVERYONE GOT A PART. SO THEY REWROTE THEM TO KIND OF INCORPORATE ALL THE CHARACTERS.
Jimmy: SURE.

NO. NO, NO, NO.

IT'S THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER FORGOTTEN THE LINES TO ANYTHING. SO I WAS LIKE OUT ON STAGE, IT WAS MY BIG MOMENT. IT WAS MY SOLO SINGING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I JUST TOTALLY CORPSED. AND THE PIANO PLAYER IS KIND -- ♪♪ KIND OF TRYING TO REMIND ME. AND I JUST WAS LIKE, STOMPING MY FOOT, AND JUST -- "I DON'T KNOW IT! [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS!"
