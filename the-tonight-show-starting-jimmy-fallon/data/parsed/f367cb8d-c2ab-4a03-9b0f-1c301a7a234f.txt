Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I FEEL THE LOVE. THAT'S VERY, VERY NICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYONE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE, YOU'RE HERE, YOU'RE HERE. WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I WANT TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO OUR PAL NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR, CHRIS CHRISTIE, WHO TURNS 52-YEARS-OLD TOMORROW. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THIS IS COOL. THE STAR OF TLC'S SHOW "CAKE BOSS" IS ACTUALLY MAKING THE CAKE FOR CHRIS CHRISTIE'S BIRTHDAY PARTY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S CORRECT. YEAH, IN FACT, I HEAR HE IS EVEN MAKING THE CAKE IN THE SHAPE OF CHRISTIE'S FAVORITE THING -- CAKE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S JUST GREAT. OF COURSE, IT'S GOING TO GET WEIRD WHEN HIS FAMILY'S LIKE, "NO, NO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BLOW THE CANDLES OUT BEFORE YOU EAT IT, CHRIS." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY DIDN'T LIKE THAT ONE.
Steve: NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: RIGHT NOW, GOVERNOR CHRISTIE IS ON A TRIP TO MEXICO TO MEET WITH THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT. THAT'S RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WHILE HE WAS DOWN THERE -- DON'T LAUGH AT EVERYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST WAIT UNTIL I GET TO THE PUNCH LINE. THEN YOU -- [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S MEETING WITH THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT. AND WHILE HE WAS DOWN THERE, HE SAID THE U.S. NEEDS TO EXPORT MORE NATURAL GAS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. AND SO, WHEN ASKED HOW HE PLANS TO DO THAT -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- CHRISTIE SAID, "BURRITOS, ENCHILADAS. WHATEVER IT TAKES, I'LL JUST DO IT. WHATEVER IT IS, I'LL TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY I'LL TAKE FIVE FOR THE TEAM. I SAW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA MET WITH PRINCE CHARLES YESTERDAY DURING HIS TRIP TO WALES. NO WORD ON WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT, BUT I'M SURE THEY BOTH HEARD IT LOUD AND CLEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] "YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL. STOP YELLING." [ IN AN ENGLISH ACCENT ] "I'M NOT YELLING ACTUALLY. YOU'RE THE ONE YELLING." [ NORMALLY ] "I'M ACTUALLY NOT. I'M TALKING LIKE I'M STANDING IN THE FRONT ROW OF BURNING MAN." [ LAUGHTER ] [ IN AN ENGLISH ACCENT ] "PLEASE, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THESE BOSE NOISE CANCELING HEADPHONES ON TO HAVE A A CONVERSATION WITH YOU. SORRY, SORRY. I'M HEARING A BUTTERFLY FLAP ITS WINGS IN AUSTRALIA." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, THINGS AREN'T LOOKING GOOD FOR THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW. IN FACT, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS DECIDED NOT TO SEND OBAMA TO CAMPAIGN IN BATTLE GROUND STATES BECAUSE OF HIS LOW APPROVAL RATING COULD HURT DEMOCRATS. YES, THEY'RE ONLY SENDING HIM TO WHERE HE CAN'T DO ANY DAMAGE, OR AS THAT'S ALSO KNOWN, THE BIDEN CIRCUIT. [ LAUGHTER ] TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD IS BACK IN THE NEWS AFTER HE DROPPED OUT OF TWO -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -- I'M HAPPY TOO. I'M ALWAYS HAPPY WHEN HE'S IN THE NEWS.

[ LAUGHTER ] "THERE'S ONE WHERE MY TOP'S OFF MY DUESENBERG IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT."
Steve: AWOOGAH! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA THOUGH. THERE'S A TABLET THAT'S AIMED AT SENIORS. THEY EVEN CAME OUT WITH THEIR OWN APPS THAT ARE TARGETED AT SENIORS AS WELL. LET ME SHOW YOU A FEW. FIRST THERE'S "EARLY BIRDS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT, WE HAVE "iPRUNES." [ LAUGHTER ] AFTER THAT, WE GOT "NAPCHAT." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, WE HAVE "WORDS WITH WHATEVER FRIENDS YOU HAVE LEFT."

[ LAUGHTER ] ONE RESEARCHER WAS LIKE, "ACTUALLY, THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A -- MUSHROOM. [ LAUGHTER ] IT LOOKS LIKE A MUSHROOM." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MUSHROOM? HERE'S A WEIRD STORY HERE. A WILDLIFE CENTER IN CHINA REVEALED THAT ONE OF ITS PANDAS ACTUALLY FAKED HER PREGNANCY SO THAT SHE COULD GET MORE FOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: OH, YEAH.

[ LAUGHTER ] "YEAH, THE WIND IS BLOWING AND --" [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, YOU JUST KEEP HOLDING THAT METAL ROD UP IN THE STORM. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
