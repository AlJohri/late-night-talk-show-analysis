Jimmy: WOW.
IT'S NOT REAL. I COULDN'T BE A COP. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A -- I COULDN'T START BEING A COP NOW.
Jimmy: I FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN YOU AS A COP.

THAT'S RIGHT. ANYWAY, I LIKE DOING THOSE SHOWS. IT'S FUN. BESIDES MY OWN WORK TO GO AND START OTHER SHOWS FOR OTHER PEOPLE, THAT'S REALLY GRATIFYING. IT'S FUN.
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU STILL HAVE A BOAT?
YES, I STILL HAVE A BOAT. I HAVEN'T BEEN ON IT FOR A A WHILE BECAUSE I HAD A A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE, BUT -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LIKE WHAT?
I TOOK MY DAUGHTER. WE -- OKAY. THIS WAS OUR PLAN. WE WERE GOING TO GO FROM NEW YORK CITY TO BOSTON ON MY BOAT. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE LITTLE HOPS.

AND SO, EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT. WE WENT OUT TO LONG ISLAND SOUND, AND THEN, WE WENT TO BLOCK ISLAND. THAT'S THE LAST STOP BEFORE IT'S, LIKE, REALLY THE OCEAN, RIGHT? SO, WE MADE LUNCH, AND IT'S A A BEAUTIFUL DAY. AND SO, BLOCK ISLAND IS LIKE THIS.
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
AND THEN, THIS IS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, JUST CRUSHING IT. AND WE'RE ON THIS SIDE. AND WE'RE LIKE -- ♪ DE DE DE DO THIS IS NICE ♪ AND THEN, WE GET ABOVE IT, AND WE TURN RIGHT AND JUST THE OCEAN JUST -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, IT WAS TERRIFYING, AND THE BOAT'S CLIMBING WAVES, AND THEN JUST -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] JUST PLUMMETING, AND THEN TOTALLY ENGULFED IN WATER. AND MY DAUGHTER'S SCREAMING, JUST SCREAMING. AND SHE'S, LIKE, "I CAN'T DO THIS!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I'M, LIKE, "THIS IS GOOD FOR HER, YOU KNOW." [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S GOING TO LEARN.
Jimmy: WITH YOU?
SHE'S GOING TO LEARN FROM THIS. IT'S GOING TO BE A FORMATIVE EXPERIENCE. AND THEN, I SEE JUST THIS WAVE COMING FROM THE SIDE NOW. AND I WAS, "LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO [ BLEEP ] DO THIS [ BLEEP ]." [ LAUGHTER ] "I DON'T WANT TO DO IT." I AM TERRIFIED.
Jimmy: WHAT DID YOU DO?
SO, WE JUST TURN AROUND -- IT WAS, LIKE, THREE MINUTES OF THAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE TURNED AROUND, WENT BACK. GOT A BIG FAIRY BOAT TO TAKE US TO RHODE ISLAND AND BOUGHT A A TENT IN A WALMART AND WENT CAMPING. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS THE -- AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE BOAT SINCE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I -- SOMETIMES I'M, LIKE, SITTING IN AN AIRPORT OR WHEREVER AND I REMEMBER THAT MOMENT AND I GO, "UGH." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M 49 YEARS OLD. SHE'S 11.
