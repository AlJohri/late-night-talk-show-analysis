Jimmy: YEAH! HOT CROWD! HOT CROWD! WELCOME! WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HOT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. I LOVE YOU, TOO. [ CHEERS ] WELCOME. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. BILL CLINTON IS BACK IN THE NEWS. HE GAVE A SPEECH IN IOWA THIS WEEKEND, WHERE HE CRITICIZED REPUBLICANS FOR SPENDING ALL THEIR TIME DISSING PRESIDENT OBAMA. PEOPLE FROM IOWA MISSED THE REST OF THE SPEECH BECAUSE THEY WERE ON URBAN DICTIONARY LOOKING UP THE WORD "DISSING." [ LAUGHTER ] GET THIS MARY, DISSING IS WHEN SOMEONE IS DISRESPECTING SOMEONE ELSE. AS IN, "YO, BACK OFF, DON'T DIS MY PEEPS." [ LAUGHTER ] WHY WOULD THEY DIS THOSE EASTER MARSHMALLOW CANDIES, ANYWAY? I MEAN, THEY'RE DELICIOUS. HILLARY CLINTON ALSO GAVE A A SPEECH IN IOWA WHERE SHE FUELED SPECULATION THAT SHE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT WHEN SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE'S THINKING ABOUT IT. NEXT WEEK SHE'LL BE THINKING ABOUT IT WHEN SHE'S IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BEFORE SHE SPENDS A FEW DAYS THINKING ABOUT IT IN FLORIDA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JUST SAY YOU'RE RUNNING. JUST SAY YOU'RE RUNNING. BIG INTERNATIONAL NEWS. THIS WEEK SCOTLAND WILL VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT IT WANTS TO LEAVE THE UNITED KINGDOM. IF IT VOTES YES, IT WILL ALSO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NATO AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFENDING ITSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] OR AS VLADIMIR PUTIN PUT IT, "I GOT DIBS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S MINE. ONE DAY, BABY. HOLD ON, NOT YET. OF COURSE, IF SCOTLAND DOES BREAK UP WITH ENGLAND, ENGLAND WILL JUST DO WHAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES, STALK THEM ON FACEBOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] SCOTLAND HAS GAINED A LOT OF WEIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW YOU'VE ALL DONE IT, SO DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I READ THAT QUEEN ELIZABETH IS TRYING TO STAY NEUTRAL ABOUT SCOTLAND'S UPCOMING VOTE TO LEAVE THE UK. YOU CAN TELL THE QUEEN IS NEUTRAL BASED ON HER EXPRESSION. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH HER EXCITED FACE. OR HER WORRIED FACE. OR HER PARTY FACE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS A LITTLE AWKWARD. DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS ABOUT KANYE WEST? HE'S FACING CRITICISM NOW AFTER HE CALLED OUT TWO FANS FOR NOT STANDING UP DURING HIS CONCERT LAST WEEK. AND HE DIDN'T REALIZE THEY WERE DISABLED. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] BUT KANYE SAYS HE HAS OTHER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT, LIKE WHY STEVIE WONDER NEVER WAVES BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOT ONCE. AND WHY STEVEN HAWKING STILL USES AUTO TUNE. NO ONE DOES THAT ANYMORE.
Steve: NO, NO.
Jimmy: I THOUGHT THIS WAS A A LITTLE WEIRD. I READ THAT THE MARRIOTT HOTEL CHAIN HAS A NEW CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE GUESTS TO LEAVE TIPS FOR THEIR MAIDS. PRETTY INTERESTING. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. WE DON'T PAY OUR MAIDS WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST PAY THEM MORE. NOT MY PROBLEM. THIS IS CRAZY. COLOMBIA'S NATIONAL WOMENS' CYCLING TEAM, DID YOU SEE THEIR NEW UNIFORMS? WHAT'S WRONG WITH PEOPLE? HOW COULD THIS GET PAST SOMEONE? SOMEONE HAD TO HAVE SAID YES TO THIS. IT'S A COLOR CHOICE THAT THEY CHOSE AS PART OF THE UNIFORM. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. LOOK AT THE UNIFORMS THEY'RE WEARING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT! WHY?
Jimmy: THE COLOMBIAN WOMENS' CYCLING TEAM.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: LOOK AT IT AGAIN. LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU SURE THAT'S NOT THE BRAZILIAN WOMENS' CYCLING TEAM?

I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT PEOPLE KNOW THE SOME OF US, BUT NOT THE SUM OF US. THEY KNOW S-O-M-E OF US, BUT NOT S-U-M OF US. AND ALL OF US HAVE SOME MORE SONGS THAT NEED TO BE SHOWN. PEOPLE GET THE SOME OF US, S-O-M-E.

Jimmy: YEAH.
AND -- THEN I COULDN'T FIND THE STEAM ROOM.
Jimmy: YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
I SAID TO JIMMY, "HAVE YOU EVER BEEN HERE BEFORE? DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE STEAM ROOM IS?" AND YOU SAID, "I WILL FIND IT FOR YOU." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HONSETLY, I WAS ACTUALLY, I WAS LOST MYSELF. I DIDN'T KNOW -- BECAUSE I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE EITHER.
OH, YOU HADN'T?
Jimmy: AND I HADN'T WORKED OUT IN LIKE THREE YEARS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO I WAS A LITTLE -- SO I DIDN'T KNOW. SO I WENT UP TO THE NICE GIRL, AND I GO, "HI, WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE SAUNA." AND THEN I GO, "NO, NOT WE, SHE WILL BE IN THE SAUNA, I NEED TO GET TO MY ELEVATOR. SO I CAN GET TO MY ROOM.
THAT'S HER. SHE LOOKS AT US LIKE, THERE'S A A MEN'S AND A WOMEN'S.
Jimmy: THERE'S NO CO-ED STEAMER. I'M LIKE, "NO, NO, NO." IT WAS GOOD LUCK RUNNING INTO YOU, BECAUSE YOU WON.

YOU ARE. THE YEAR YOU HOSTED, I WON, AND THEN THE YEAR I GOT TO HANG OUT WITH YOU BEFORE THE SHOW, I WON.
Jimmy: AW, THAT'S GREAT.
SO YOU'RE MY EMMY.
Jimmy: BUT SOMETHING ALWAYS WEIRD HAPPENS TO YOU AT THE EMMYS. SOMETHING BAD ALWAYS HAPPENS -- REMEMBER YOU HAD YOUR DRESS RIPPED THE ONE TIME, RIGHT?
THE FIRST -- YEAH, I SAT DOWN AND PUT MY SHOES ON AND I WAS ALL READY -- THE WHOLE BACK OF THE DRESS JUST WENT LIKE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE HOTEL. THAT WAS ONE YEAR. THEY WERE SEWING ME INTO IT. AND THEN ANOTHER YEAR MY FLIGHT GOT CANCELED AND I ACTUALLY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A DRESS. AND JUST EVERY YEAR --
Jimmy: WHAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR?
SO THIS YEAR, I WAS EXPECTING THE WORST. BECAUSE IT WAS ON A MONDAY. THEY WEREN'T GOING TO SHUT DOWN -- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT THEY TOLD ME TO GET IN THE CAR AN EXTRA HOUR EARLY BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC.
Jimmy: YEAH AND IT'S L.A., SO YOU LEAVE AT LIKE 9:00 IN THE MORNING FOR THE EMMYS.
YEAH. THE EMMYS START AT 5:00. THEY WANT YOU IN THE CAR AT 2:00.
Jimmy: YES SO YOU CAN GET TO -- THREE HOURS TO DRIVE.
YEAH. BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WILL TAKE THREE HOURS TO DRIVE IN RUSH HOUR. THEY CAN'T CLOSE DOWN THE STREETS.
Jimmy: AND YOU CAN SEE THE VENUE FROM YOUR HOTEL. YOU COULD WALK THERE FASTER. BUT WHEN YOU DRIVE, YEAH.
AND SO I GOT ALL NERVOUS AND MISSED IT. THEN YOU HAVE TO WALK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SHUT DOWN THE STREETS, IN YOUR HIGH HEELS, LIKE FIVE FOOTBALL FIELD LENGTHS TO GET TO THE RED CARPET, AT WHICH POINT I SAID, "IN 98-DEGREE WEATHER, I'LL LOOK REALLY GOOD."
Jimmy: YOU LOOK FANTASTIC. YEAH, YEAH!
SO WE GOT IN THE CAR. AND GOD BLESS MY HUSBAND, HE ALWAYS BRINGS A LITTLE BUBBLY. AND I WAS LIKE -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: THE GUYS INSTALLING THEIR CAMERAS ARE LIKE, "YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE YET. I'LL STILL TAKE YOUR PICTURE."
WE WERE SO EARLY, WE KEPT CIRCLING THE BLOCK.
Jimmy: NO! YOU DID NOT!
CIRCLING THE BLOCK AND FINALLY, WE WERE LIKE, "LET'S JUST PULL OVER AND POUR SOME OF THAT CHAMPAGNE."
Jimmy: THAT'S AWESOME.
I SAID, I SHOULDN'T REALLY HAVE MORE THAN A SIP OR TWO, BECAUSE I HAVE TO WALK FIVE FOOTBALL FIELDS. AND IT WAS -- THEY HAD LITTLE GOLF CARTS. AND BY THE WAY, IT WAS TEN FEET. I WAS MORTIFIED.
Jimmy: IT WAS SO WELL ORGANIZED THIS YEAR.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. 75 DEGREES. THEY HAD LITTLE SKRIMS OVER THE RED CARPETS SO NO ONE WAS SWEATING. IT WAS THE EASIEST, MOST LOVELY EMMY AWARDS -- LIKE THE PRE SHOW THAT I'VE EVER --
Jimmy: AND YOU HAVE A THING ON THE RED CARPET 'CAUSE YOU ALWAYS LOOK HAPPY AND SMILEY EVEN THOUGH -- AND YOU HAVE A LITTLE SECRET, A A TIP.
I HAVE A TIP.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU DO?
UM, WELL, IN ORDER -- I FIND IT AWKWARD, YOU KNOW. IT'S SORT OF AN AWKWARD THING TO DO, LIKE JUST WALK DOWN AND SMILE FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT IF YOU HUM -- [ HUMMING "IF I ONLY HAD A A BRAIN" ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "IF I ONLY HAD A A BRAIN," THAT'S WHAT YOU HUM? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. [ HUMMING "IF I ONLY HAD A A BRAIN" ]
SEE? IT MAKES YOU LOOK HAPPY. AND RELAXED. NO MATTER WHAT.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT.
AND FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T HUM ANY OTHER SONG.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE ONE THAT GOES IN YOUR HEAD. THAT'S GOOD. NOW I CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MY -- I CAN'T GET THAT OUT OF MY HEAD. IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU WORK IN TELEVISION, AND YOU DIDN'T GROW UP WITH A TV.
NO, I DID NOT. TV WAS SORT OF SATAN IN OUR HOUSE. MY PARENTS FELT THAT IT TOOK ALL THE CREATIVITY AWAY FROM THE CHILD.
Jimmy: WERE THEY HIPPIE PARENTS?
THEY WERE HIPPIE DIPPIE PARENTS. YOU KNOW I -- YEAH, MY DAD WAS -- THEY WERE WAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE. LIKE EVERYONE'S INTO HEALTH FOOD AND STUFF NOW. THAT WAS MY LIFE. I BEGGED FOR FROSTED FLAKES. I WAS LUCKY IF I GOT GRANOLA WITH RAISINS IN IT TO SWEETEN IT UP.
Jimmy: "HERE'S AN EXTRA SPOON FULL OF DIRT, HONEY. THERE YOU GO, EAT UP."
THEY WERE -- I MEAN, THEY ALWAYS LET US HAVE, YOU KNOW, IF WE WERE GOING TO HAVE ICE CREAM, IT WAS GOING TO BE HAAGEN-DAZS ICE CREAM. THERE WAS JUST NO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS, OR PROCESSED FOODS. THE BREAD HAD TO BE WHOLE GRAIN.
Jimmy: YOUR DAD WAS INVOLVED IN TELEVISION AS WELL.
SO YES, SO TV WAS SORT OF THE ANTI-CHRIST IN OUR HOUSE, AND YET MY FATHER MADE HIS LIVING WRITING TV JINGLES.
Jimmy: CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HE -- WHAT HE MADE? ♪ PLOP, PLOP, FIZZ FIZZ, OH, WHAT A RELIEF IT IS ♪
Jimmy: THAT IS AWESOME! THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT WAS MY DAD.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE BEST JINGLE OF ALL TIME.
BUT HE, UNLIKE THE SHOW, "MAD MEN," WHICH I'M A HUGE FAN OF, MY FATHER DIDN'T DRINK, DIDN'T SMOKE, AND WAS A A VEGETARIAN.
Jimmy: THEY WROTE THAT CHARACTER OUT OF "MAD MEN." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE'S NOT IN THAT EPISODE.
BUT THEY WERE THREE MARTINI LUNCHES. EVERYONE SMOKED SO HE WOULD SIT THERE, SO IT WAS NOT A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR HIM.
Jimmy: THAT'S HILARIOUS.
SO YEAH, AND WE NEVER WATCHED TELEVISION ONCE. MY GRANDMOTHER GOT US A TV, A A BLACK-AND-WHITE. BECAUSE SHE SAID, THIS IS RIDICULOUS, THE CHILDREN SHOULD BE ABLE TO WATCH TV. AND MY MOTHER CAUGHT US WATCHING "BATMAN" OR SOMETHING. SHE WOULD ALWAYS COME HOME AND GO, "IT WAS ON."
Jimmy: SHE COULD FEEL THE HEAT ON THE TELEVISION?
SHE WOULD FEEL THE HEAT ON THE TV.
Jimmy: SMARTY PANTS, THAT'S GREAT.
AND SHE SAID, "IT'S GOING OUT THE WINDOW." AND THE NEXT DAY IT WAS GONE.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: DID SHE THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW?
I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE.
Jimmy: I BET SHE REALLY DID.
BUT IT IS FUNNY THAT I MAKE MY LIVING IN TELEVISION. AND NOW SHE'S OBSESSED WITH TV. SHE'S LIKE, "HONEY, HAVE YOU WATCHED ANY OF 'JUDGE JUDY'?" [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: MY MOM CALLS ME AND TELLS ME, EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED ON "ELLEN" AND ALL THE FUNNY -- LIKE, "OH, THEN THEY SAID THIS AND THEN THEY -- I'M LIKE, "OKAY MA, YEAH I KNOW. WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL ELLEN?" [ LAUGHTER ] YOU LOVE HER MORE THAN YOU LOVE ME. WATCH MY SHOW FOR ONCE.
SHE CAN'T STAY UP FOR YOUR SHOW.
Jimmy: NO, SHE DOESN'T WATCH MY SHOW. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
Jimmy: SHE'S A KIMMEL FAN. [ LAUGHTER ] LOVES HIM.
MY MOTHER IS GOING TO TAKE DISCO NAP. LIKE FROM 9:00 TO 11:00. AND THEN TURN YOU ON AT 11:30. TO WATCH YOU.

YEAH, IT IS A BIG THING. LET'S HOPE THE FOOTBALL GAME ENDS ON TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WE GET A LOT OF COMPLAINTS FROM OUR FANS SAYING, YOU KNOW, WHEN IS IT GOING TO AIR? BUT NOW CBS GOT HIP, AND THEY'RE LIKE, "IN 22 MINUTES, "THE GOOD WIFE" WILL BE ON. AND THEY LIKE KEEP TRACK OF THIS THING SO PEOPLE KNOW WHEN TO TURN IT ON.
Jimmy: THEY'RE HOPING THE GAME IS GONNA END IN 22 MINUTES. LIKE, OOPS, WE WERE WRONG. THERE WAS A FUMBLE. THEY STOPPED THE CLOCK. THERE WAS AN INJURY. SORRY. IT'S 25 MINUTES NOW.
IT'S NOT LIKE THE GUYS WHO ARE WATCHING THE FOOTBALL ARE REALLY GOING TO TUNE INTO OUR SHOW.
Jimmy: THERE COULD BE A A LITTLE CROSSOVER.
I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN A BIT OF A CROSSOVER SINCE THIS HAPPENED.
Jimmy: SOME PEOPLE GET SO LAZY AND THEY'RE SO COMFY AFTER THE GAME, THEY GO, "I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL." [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYTHING'S GOING SO GREAT RIGHT NOW. AND THEN THEY GO -- WATCH YOU GET NEW FANS.
WE ACTUALLY DID. WE GOT A WHOLE MALE CONTINGENCY THAT STARTED WATCHING. BECAUSE WHY NOT? JUST STAY IN THE LA-Z-BOY.

YOU'RE GOING TO TELL IT TO THE AUDIENCE?
Jimmy: I WILL SHOW IT TO THE AUDIENCE.
NO, ARE YOU NUTS? [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BOTH BE LOOKING FOR WORK, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.
Jimmy: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST DID THAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS EVER. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED. I WROTE HIM A FILTHY NOTE. AND HANDED IT TO HIM AT AN INOPPORTUNE TIME. AND I HAD TO WATCH HIS FACE. AND IT WENT FROM -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DIDN'T SEE IT, I SAW IT.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. BY THE WAY, THE ANSWER IS, NO, YOU CANNOT SAY THAT WORD. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU FOR ASKING. WHEN YOU SEE THESE JOKES, AND THESE BITS, THEY'RE JUST SO WELL CRAFTED AND SO WELL DIRECTED. YOU DIRECTED THEM AND YOU WROTE THEM AND YOU STARRED IN THEM. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN ANY MORE THESE DAYS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE HOW MUCH WORK YOU PUT INTO THIS STUFF. THIS ALSO COMES WITH "CINDERFELLA" AND "THE ERRAND BOY."
YEAH.
Jimmy: THERE'S A SCENE IN "THE ERRAND BOY" WHERE YOU ARE IN AN OFFICE AND YOU'RE JUST LIP SYNCING TO JAZZ -- OR, NO. BIG BAND.
COUNT BASIE BAND.
Jimmy: COUNT BASIE. AND IT'S SOMETHING I NEVER -- HOW DID YOU KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT?
I WAS VERY CLEVER.
Jimmy: NO, NO, JERRY, YOU HAVE TO BE MORE HUMBLE. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, JERRY, I WANT TO SHOW -- IF YOU DON'T MIND. I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP OF "THE ERRAND BOY" JUST TO SEE THE SCENE. NO WORDS ARE SPOKEN. IT'S AWESOME. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: I MEAN, THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE. ♪♪ THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S UNBELIEVEABLE.
I WAS SUCH A FAN OF BILL, COUNT BASIE. SUCH A FAN OF THE BAND, THAT I USED THREE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THEY DID IN THREE DIFFERENT FILMS. AND THEY ALWAYS SERVED ME, BECAUSE WHEN I WRITE, I THINK IN TERMS OF MUSIC. AND THERE'S MUSIC ON ALL THE TIME THAT I'M WORKING. AND WHEN I DID THE SECOND BASIE NUMBER, THEY SURPRISED ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY. HE BROUGHT THE WHOLE BAND OUT TO HOLLYWOOD, SET THEM UP ON THE STAGE AT PARAMOUNT. I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE THERE. THEY BROUGHT ME OVER TO WISH ME A HAPPY BIRTHDAY, AND THERE'S COUNT BASIE ORCHESTRA PLAYING "SMILE" FOR WHEN I WALKED OUT. IT WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE.
Jimmy: THAT IS AMAZING. HOW COOL IS THAT?
WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS A LONG TIME. WHEN BILL WAS ALIVE, WE WERE FRIENDS. NO MORE, BECAUSE HE'S NOT HERE ANY MORE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH, BUT HE'S NOT. DO YOU THINK WE COULD TRY THAT NOW, HAVING A CONVERSATION USING JUST HORNS AND INSTRUMENTS?
WITH WHO?
Jimmy: THE ROOTS? SEE IF WE COULD TRY TO TALK TO EACH OTHER?
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
Jimmy: JUST -- ♪♪ ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NICE. NICE. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU. DO WE HAVE TIME?
Jimmy: YEAH.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I HAD TO COME TO NEW YORK FOR THE FRIARS AND SO ON. AND I DECIDED THIS TRIP, I WAS GOING TO RIDE THE SUBWAY. I HAVEN'T BEEN ON IT IN 50, 60 YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I GET ON THE SUBWAY YESTERDAY. AND THE TRAIN STOPS AT A A STATION, AND SOME PEOPLE GET ON, SOME PEOPLE GET OFF. THERE'S ONE GUY COMES ON, A A YOUNG GUY, AND HE'S WEARING A A LEATHER JACKET, LEATHER PANTS, GOLD HANGING FROM HIS EARS, ONE OUT OF HIS EYE. I MEAN, HE WAS SHARP. LEATHER PANTS, BOOTS UP TO THERE. I MEAN, HE WAS TODAY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE HAD HIS HAIR SPIKED, YELLOW, RED, GREEN, PURPLE. SO I'M LOOKING AT HIM. HE SAID, "WHAT'S THE MATTER, OLD MAN, DIDN'T YOU EVER DO ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY IN YOUR LIFE?" [ LAUGHTER ] L I SAID, "YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT, 20 YEARS AGO I HAD SEX WITH A PARROT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY SON." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
