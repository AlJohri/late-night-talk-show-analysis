NEIL AND I HAVE A KIND OF -- IT'S WELL, FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM WE HAVE WHAT -- I MEAN I WOULD CALL IT PHYSICAL. IT'S A PHYSICAL SCENE. IT'S A TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING SCENE. AND OBVIOUSLY DAVID FINCHER HAD US REHEARSE IT QUITE INTENSIVELY.
Jimmy: YEAH. HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT REHEARSING THAT OR PRACTICING IT?
WELL YOU KNOW. I MEAN NEIL AND I WERE KIND OF LEFT ALONE ON THE SOUND STAGE FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. BUT DAVID SORT OF REALLY WOULD HAVE HAD US DOING IT ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT. AND I, YOU KNOW, YOU GET INTO THE FINCHER MINDSET AND YOU THINK, "MAYBE I HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH REHEARSALS."
Jimmy: NO, NO. YEAH.
AND SO I WENT HOME AND I THOUGHT, WELL, I COULD ASK MY HUSBAND TO KIND OF DO THIS WITH ME. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE NO, I THINK THAT WOULD BE WEIRD. SO I WENT DOWN TO CVS. I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM SET ONE NIGHT AND I WENT INTO CVS AND I FOUND THIS -- I FOUND THIS DORA THE EXPLORER FELT DOLL. RIGHT? SO SHE WAS ONLY KIND OF THIS BIG, RIGHT? AND I THOUGHT, WELL, I COULD KIND OF USE THAT. BUT SHE WASN'T TALL ENOUGH. SHE HAD TO BE AS TALL AS NEIL PATRICK HARRIS. SO I GAFFER TAPED HER TO A A POST, RIGHT? AND THEN I PRACTICED THE SCENE AT HOME BY THE SWIMMING POOL.
Jimmy: OUTSIDE?
OUTSIDE. AND WE RENT A HOUSE IN THE HILLS. WHICH IS ONE OF THESE HOUSES THAT FEELS REALLY PRIVATE, BUT IN FACT IS OVERLOOKED BY A LOT OF OTHER HOUSES.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU THINK IT'S PRIVATE, BUT YEAH.
SO IF ANYONE'S ACTUALLY LOOKING OUT OF THE HOUSE THAT MORNING, THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN ME DOING HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE THINGS TO THIS DORA THE EXPLORER DOLL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU ARE CRAZY.
WELL, I KNOW. AND I WAS LIKE, THIS ISN'T EVEN -- YOU CAN'T EVEN -- THIS ISN'T EVEN COOL. THIS ISN'T EVEN LIKE METHOD ACTING. THIS IS JUST LIKE --
Jimmy: THIS IS A WOMAN ATTACKING A DORA THE EXPLORER DOLL.
THIS IS INSANE.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A CRAZY PERSON. YEAH, I LOVE IT. WELL, IT WORKED.
FINCHER DOES THAT TO YOU I THINK.
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT IT WORKED OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE YOU GOT AN OSCAR NOMINATION FOR THIS ROLE AND YOU TOTALLY DESERVE IT. IT WAS FANTASTIC.
WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. HERE'S A CLIP OF ROSAMUND PIKE AND BEN AFFLECK IN "GONE GIRL." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
I'VE KILLED FOR YOU. WHO ELSE CAN SAY THAT? YOU THINK YOU'D BE HAPPY WITH A A NICE MIDWESTERN GIRL? NO WAY, BABY. I'M IT.
YOU'RE DELUSIONAL. WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WANT THIS? YES, I LOVED YOU, AND THEN ALL WE DID WAS RESENT EACH OTHER AND TRY TO CONTROL EACH OTHER AND CAUSE EACH OTHER PAIN.
