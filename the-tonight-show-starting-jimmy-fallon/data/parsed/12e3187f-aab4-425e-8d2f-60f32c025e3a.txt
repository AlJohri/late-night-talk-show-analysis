Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, COME ON. THAT IS A GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD RIGHT THERE TONIGHT. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY! THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. A HOT CROWD. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. ON FRIDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE A SURPRISE VISIT TO STONEHENGE ON HIS WAY BACK FROM THE NATO SUMMIT IN WALES. AND EVEN CRAZIER, TODAY HE MADE A SURPRISE VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, MAN?" REALLY EXCITING. THAT'S RIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA VISITED STONEHENGE. IT WAS GOING WELL UNTIL BIDEN WAS LIKE, "LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THESE DOMINOES." [ LAUGHTER ] NO BIDEN! [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, HERE'S SOME MORE NEWS OUT OF ENGLAND, THE ROYLE A FAMILY ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT PRINCE  WILLIAM AND KATE MIDDLETON ARE EXPECTING THEIR SECOND CHILD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S GREAT. HUGE. BEEN A HUGE DAY FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY AND A TERRIBLE DAY FOR ANYONE ELSE ANNOUNCING THEIR PREGNANCY. [ LAUGHTER ] "WE'RE EXPECTING TOO, SO, YOU KNOW. DOUG AND I JUST DECIDED TO GO FOR IT ONE NIGHT AND WE JUST, YOU KNOW, GOT SOME WINE AND WE --" YEAH, WE DON'T CARE. THE ROYAL BABY'S ON ITS WAY. THAT'S RIGHT. KATE MIDDLETON IS EXPECTING HER SECOND CHILD WHO WILL BE FOURTH IN LINE FOR THE THRONE, BEHIND PRINCE GEORGE, AND PUSH PRINCE HARRY TO FIFTH IN LINE. OR AS THE ROYAL FAMILY CALLS THAT, "STILL TOO CLOSE. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST DON'T TRUST -- I DON'T TRUST. WE CAN'T, THAT'S TOO CLOSE." YESTERDAY WAS THE FIRST NFL SUNDAY OF THE NEW SEASON. LOTS OF BIG GAMES. [ CHEERS ] LOTS OF BIG GAMES, LOTS OF BIG UPSETS. AND THIS REALLY MADE ME LAUGH. DID YOU SEE THIS? THE KICKER FROM THE CAROLINA PANTHERS WENT ON THE FIELD TO TRY AND WARM UP AT HALFTIME? UNFORTUNATELY, A MARCHING BAND WAS STILL OUT THERE PERFORMING. I DON'T KNOW IF HE HANDLED IT THAT WELL. I DON'T KNOW. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
GRAHAM GANO, THE KICKER FOR THE PANTHERS TRYING TO STAY LOOSE WHILE THE BAND WAS PERFORMING DURING THE HALF. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU KNOW THE KICKER WAS JUST EXCITED TO BE TOUGH FOR ONCE. HE'S LIKE, "OUT OF MY WAY EVEN NERDIER NERD! GET OUT OF HERE. GIVE ME YOUR LUNCH MONEY! NORMALLY, I'M THE ONE GETTING PUSH AROUND, BUT NOT TODAY, MAN!" THE KID DIDN'T STOP.
Steve: HE KEPT ON PLAYING.
Jimmy: LIKE, "YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE, DUDE, NOT ME. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HERE." ONWARD.

[ LAUGHTER ] CAN YOU SAY IT IN FRENCH?" THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. I READ THAT SHAQUILLE O'NEAL HAS APPLIED TO BE A RESERVE POLICE OFFICER IN THE CITY OF DORAL, FLORIDA. WHICH IS A COOL IDEA UNTIL HE TRIES TO GO UNDERCOVER. "HI, I'M A NEW STUDENT AT THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN YOU SELL ME SOME POT?" "YOU'RE SHAQUILLE O'NEAL." "DAMN IT, THEY MADE ME. GET BACK UP, CALL FOR BACK UP." [ LAUGHTER ] THE BIG TV NEWS. AMC IS COMING OUT WITH A A SPIN-OFF OF "THE WALKING DEAD" THAT WILL SHOW THE APOCALYPSE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. YEAH, IT'S CALLED "THE NEWS." [ LAUGHTER ] IT SHOULD BE VERY EXCITING. SET YOUR DVRs. [ APPLAUSE ] SET YOUR TIVOs. AND FINALLY, THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION IS CONSIDERING BUILDING A NEW HIGH-SPEED TRAIN THAT COULD GET PEOPLE FROM D.C. TO BALTIMORE IN 15 MINUTES. THAT WOULD GET YOU OUT OF WASHINGTON IN 15 MINUTES OR AS PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLS IT, "STILL NOT FAST ENOUGH." WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, EVERYBODY.

OR IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT, MAKE IT FUNNY. SO I GO, "OH, I GUESS I SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING MILK ANY MORE. OH, NO, I WILL BE DRINKING MILK. EVERY OTHER DAY IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND SO THIS ONE, IT'S ANOTHER POSITIVE MESSAGE. BUT IT'S LIKE TELLING EVERYONE -- IF YOU THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL -- THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT.
THERE'S A WAY, MAN. EVERYBODY CAN LEARN THE PRINCIPLES OF SUCCESS. I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR LIFE. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AT ALL LEVELS. LOOK, I FLUNKED OUT OF COLLEGE. I GOT TWO DIVORCES. I LIVED IN A CAR FOR THREE YEARS. I WAS HOMELESS. I'VE BEEN AT EVERY ECONOMIC STAGE YOU CAN BE AT. AND SO I KNOW HOW TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION. IF I HAD THIS BOOK WHEN I CAME OUT OF COLLEGE, I WOULD HAVE MADE IT A LONG TIME AGO. ANYBODY CAN LEARN THE PRINCIPLES OF SUCCESS. AND ONCE YOU IDENTIFY YOUR GOD-GIVEN GIFT, THAT'S YOUR GREATEST CHANCE FOR SUCCESS. BUT THE AVERAGE PERSON NEVER UNDERSTANDS THAT THEORY. THEY DIE WITH THEIR GIFT IN A A BACKPACK AS A PARACHUTE ON THEIR BACK. AND THEY DIE ON THE CLIFF WITH NEVER OPENING THEIR PARACHUTE. THAT'S A MISTAKE. GOD PUT A GIFT IN EVERY LAST ONE OF US WHEN HE CREATED US. AT BIRTH. YOU HAVE IT IN YOU. IT AIN'T OUTSIDE. IT'S AIN'T ALWAYS RUNNING, JUMPING, SINGING, DANCING. SOME PEOPLE CUT HAIR BETTER THAN EVERYBODY. SOME PEOPLE FRY CHICKEN. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. BUT EVERYBODY HAS SOMETHING THEY DO. IF YOU IDENTIFY THAT GIFT, THERE IS YOUR GREATEST CHANCE FOR SUCCESS IN YOUR LIFE. AND I TEACH HOW TO DISCOVER THAT GIFT IN THE BOOK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
