Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT'S A HOT CROWD TONIGHT, HOT CROWD. I FEEL THE LOVE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. WELCOME, EVERYBODY TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT, YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. TODAY WAS THE INDIANA PRIMARY AND THE RESULTS ARE IN. DONALD TRUMP SAW HIS SHADOW, SO THERE ARE SIX MORE MONTHS OF THE ELECTION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT. ACTUALLY, MOST PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING THIS TO BE TED CRUZ'S LAST STAND, SO HE'S REALLY GOING AGAINST -- HE'S GOING AFTER DONALD TRUMP HERE. TODAY, HE EVEN CLAIMED THAT TRUMP HAS NEVER ASKED GOD FOR FORGIVENESS FOR ANYTHING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND SAID, QUOTE, "I'VE ASKED GOD FOR FORGIVENESS THREE TIMES TODAY." [ LAUGHTER ] GOD'S LIKE, "YEAH, I KNOW, I DIDN'T PICK UP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, I LET IT GO TO PRAYER MAIL. I'LL CHECK IT TOMORROW." AND THIS IS PRETTY CRAZY. YESTERDAY, HEIDI CRUZ WAS ASKED ABOUT RUMORS THAT HER HUSBAND IS THE ZODIAC KILLER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SAID, QUOTE, "I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO HIM FOR 15 YEARS, AND I KNOW PRETTY WELL WHO HE IS." THAT STORY AGAIN, HEIDI CRUZ DIDN'T ACTUALLY DENY THAT HER HUSBAND WAS THE ZODIAC KILLER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO, HE'S NOT. BUT DONALD TRUMP JUST PICKED UP ANOTHER ENDORSEMENT. THAT'S RIGHT, HE WAS ENDORSED BY FORMER NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL COACH, LOU HOLTZ. AFTER ALSO RECEIVING AN ENDORSEMENT FROM FORMER INDIANA BASKETBALL COACH, BOBBY KNIGHT. SO IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW DONALD TRUMP WILL DEFEAT ISIS, IT'S BY CHALLENGING THEM TO A A COLLEGE SPORTING EVENT IN 1985. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S GOT IT IN THE BAG. HERE'S SOME EXCITING MOVIE NEWS THIS WEEK. IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT "SPACE JAM 2" IS IN THE WORKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THE MOVIE WILL STAR LeBRON JAMES. THAT'S RIGHT. IT WILL FEATURE LeBRON PLAYING WITH A BUNCH OF MAKE-BELIEVE TEAMMATES. OR AS LeBRON CALLS THEM, TEAMMATES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE, ACTRESS DAKOTA JOHNSON IS CURRENTLY FILMING TWO SEQUELS TO "FIFTY SHADES OF GREY," AND SAID, QUOTE, "I'VE BEEN SIMULATING SEX FOR OVER SEVEN HOURS STRAIGHT AND I'M OVER IT." [ LAUGHTER ] WHILE MARRIED WOMEN WERE, LIKE, "TRY DOING IT FOR 30 YEARS, HONEY." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HO!
Jimmy: OH, BOY. SOME TECH NEWS, HERE. APPLE JUST RELEASED THE FIRST APPS FOR ITS CARE KIT FEATURE THAT HELPS YOU KEEP TRACK OF YOUR MEDICAL CONDITIONS. AND LIKE ALL APPLE PRODUCTS, YOU REALLY START TO PANIC WHEN IT SAYS YOU ONLY HAVE 10% LEFT. [ APPLAUSE ] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? OH, AND THIS ISN'T GOOD, HERE. THE CEO OF PRICELINE JUST RESIGNED AFTER IT WAS REVEALED THAT HE HAD AN AFFAIR WITH AN EMPLOYEE. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, HIS WIFE WAS PRETTY MAD. BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, AT LEAST HE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND A A GOOD DEAL ON HOTELS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: SILVER LINING, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Jimmy: MAKE LEMONADE OUT OF LEMONS, YEAH. THIS MADE ME LAUGH, HERE. A HIGH SCHOOL FRENCH TEACHER IN TEXAS WAS FIRED FOR NOT KNOWING HOW TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT TURNS OUT THE ONLY WORD HE KNOWS IS "BONJOUR." [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED IF HE WAS SORRY FOR WHAT HE DID, THE MAN SAID, "BONJOUR." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE ONLY WORD HE KNOWS. I THOUGHT THIS WAS NICE, A A 100-YEAR-OLD WOMAN FROM RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY JUST BROKE THE WORLD RECORD FOR HER AGE GROUP IN THE 100 METER DASH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PRETTY AMAZING. IN FACT, THEY SAY SHE'S THE OLDEST PERSON TO ENTER A RACE SINCE BERNIE SANDERS. THAT'S RIGHT, WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T JUST CASUALLY DROP BY. IT'S SORT OF AN ORDEAL. YOU GOT SECRET SERVICE. I HAD TO ASK MY NEIGHBOR IF WE COULD PUT SNIPERS ON HIS ROOF. HE WAS EXCITED. HE'S RETIRED. HE'S LIKE, GREAT, GREAT. SOMETHING'S HAPPENING. [ LAUGHTER ]

THERE WERE SOME FUNNY MOMENTS BECAUSE SECRET SERVICE -- I HAVE A TWO BEDROOM HOUSE BUT THERE'S A LOT TERRITORY AROUND IT. IT'S ON A HILL AND THERE'S A A LOT OF HOMES. I ASKED THE SECRET SERVICE GUY, THIS MUST BE A PAIN FOR YOU GUYS TO SECURE THIS MUCH OF A A PARAMETER. HE SAID NO, IT'S NOTHING, WE WERE AT TYLER PERRY'S THE OTHER DAY, THAT WAS CRAZY. THAT'S RELIEVING. MY WHOLE HOME COULD FIT INTO HIS HALLWAY, YOU KNOW.

THE DEAL I HAD WAS WE COULD INTERVIEW HIM. HE WAS DOING MORNING EDITION AT NPR HERE IN NEW YORK AT THE NPR BUILDING, RIGHT. SO WE WERE GOING TO USE THE STUDIO WHEN HE WAS DONE IN THERE I WAS JUST GOING TO GO IN AND INTERVIEW HIM. IT WAS SO FUNNY BECAUSE WE'RE WAITING AT NPR, WHICH IS NPR, AND I JUST REMEMBER, WE GET THERE AND HE'S IN THERE, RIGHT, AND THERE'S A WOMAN RUNNING AROUND THE OFFICE GOING, HE'S SMOKING, HE'S SMOKING, WHAT DO WE DO. HE'S SMOKING. EVERYBODY'S LIKE, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.
Jimmy: NO.
IF KEITH RICHARDS WANTS TO SMOKE, HE'S GOING TO SMOKE. SO I GO IN THERE AND HE TOOK A A BREAK IN BETWEEN THE TWO. HE HAD A TUMBLER. LIKE A PAPER CUP OF SOMETHING. YEAH, POWERFUL. YOU KNOW, HE'S FEELING LOOSE YOU KNOW, AND HE'S SMOKING HIS MARLBOROS. AND I USED TO SMOKE MARLBOROS BUT NOW I DO NICOTINE LOZENGES.

RIGHT. SO I SHOW HIM MY NICOTINE LOZENGES. I'M LIKE, I USE TO LOVE MARLBOROS BUT I'M DOING THIS NOW KEITH. LIKE HE'S GOING TO CARE, RIGHT? SO I ASK HIM, CAN I JUST HOLD ONE? I'M LIKE AN IDIOT, TALKING TO KEITH RICHARDS AND HOLDING AN UNLIT CIGARETTE WHILE HE'S JUST KNOCKING THEM BACK. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AT SOME POINT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERVIEW, I'M BEING THIS BABY WITH MY UNLIT CIGARETTE. KEITH JUST PAUSES AND HE LOOKS AT ME AND HE THROWS THE LIGHTER AT ME. HE JUST THROWS IT AT ME. I THOUGHT IN MY HEAD, I HAVEN'T SMOKED ONE OF THESE IN TEN YEARS, BUT IF THERE'S EVER A A TIME TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE, IT'S WITH KEITH RICHARDS.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ] YEAH, I SMOKED IT. IT WAS ENJOYABLE. AND I'M GRATEFUL BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH KEITH, I WAS LUCKY IT WAS JUST A CIGARETTE. YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE DAY, WHO KNOWS. HERE YOU GO. HOW ABOUT A POUND OF COCAINE AND HEROIN.
Jimmy: THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. JUST A CIGARETTE. I GOT HIM AT A GOOD TIME.
Jimmy: YOU GOT TO HEAR THE INTERVIEW IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT. IT'S SO ENTERTAINING AND FUN. I LOVE THAT YOU FANBOYED OUT. I DO IT ALL THE TIME ON THE SHOW. WHICH I'M ABOUT TO DO ALSO WITH YOUR SHOW "MARON." PREMIERES TOMORROW ON IFC, 9:00 P.M. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO CATCH PEOPLE UP TO THIS SEASON?
WELL, AT THE END OF THE LAST SEASON, THE CHARACTER OF ME IS IN TROUBLE. I'M OKAY. THE CHARACTER OF ME'S IN TROUBLE.
Jimmy: THE FICTIONAL CHARACTER.
THE FICTIONAL MARC MARON. WHO HAS BEEN SOBER FOR 16 YEARS HAD A LITTLE BACK INJURY AND WAS PRESCRIBED SOME PAIN MEDICATION. AND HE WENT TO TOWN I GUESS YOU COULD SAY. HE INDULGED A LITTLE TOO MUCH AND BLEW A BIG BREAK. BASICALLY, THE END OF THE LAST SEASON ENDS WITH ME ON THE FLOOR BABBLING DURING A TALK SHOW. LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY KEN MARINO. HE'S MY GUEST. AND I'M INTERVIEWING HIM ON MY TALK SHOW BUT I'M NODDING OFF ON OXYCODONE. I FALL ON THE FLOOR AND START BABBLING. AND THAT'S THE END OF THE SEASON. AND IN MY MIND I THOUGHT THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO END A SERIES. BUT THEY WANTED ME BACK. AND NOW I THOUGHT, WHAT DO WE GOTTA DO NOW? WE HAVE TO GET THAT MARC MARON CLEANED UP. SO WE'RE ACTUALLY ENTERING THE STORY. WHERE I'VE BEEN USING FOR A A YEAR. I'VE LOST EVERYTHING. I HAVE NO MONEY. I HAVE NO PODCAST. INSTEAD WORKING IN MY GARAGE, I'M LIVING IN A STORAGE UNIT.
