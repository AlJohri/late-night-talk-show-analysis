MASSIVE HERO.
Jimmy: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HIM IN "CABARET"?
I SAW HIM IN "CABARET" WHEN I WAS 14. AND THAT WAS THE NIGHT WHEN I WALKED AWAY AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, I'M GOING TO BE AN ACTOR." OR TRY. OR YOU KNOW, DO SOMETHING. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT INSPIRED YOU?
YEAH, TOTALLY.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: WITH YOUR FAMILY FROM ENGLAND, I'M ASSUMING?
YEAH. I DID. MY MOM BROUGHT ME. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE WE SAW IT LAST WEEK AGAIN. WITH SIENNA. AND -- IT'S AMAZING. AND MY MOM WAS LIKE WOW, THIS IS SO INAPPROPRIATE FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE 14.
Jimmy: WHEN YOU'RE 14.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I TOOK YOU TO THIS. YEAH, IT WAS AMAZING.
Jimmy: WAS THAT THE FIRST TIME YOU EVER CAME TO NEW YORK?
NO. WE CAME WHEN I WAS 11 AS WELL. YEAH, WE CAME WITH MY WHOLE FAMILY.
Jimmy: WHAT DID YOU FEEL? WHAT DID YOU THINK? GREAT CITY, RIGHT?
OH, IT'S SO GREAT. WE HAD ONE OF THOSE KIND OF CLASSIC FAMILY HOLIDAY TRIPS -- WELL, BRITISH FAMILY HOLIDAY TRIPS, WHERE YOU'RE SORT OF MISERABLE ALL THE TIME. YOU KNOW, JUST TRUDGING AROUND. WE WENT TO SEE "LES MISERABLES," WHICH WAS ANOTHER BIG MOMENT FOR ME BECAUSE I'M A A BIG MUSICAL THEATER GEEK. AND I GOT THE T-SHIRT. AND IT WAS LIKE THE COOLEST THING EVER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN WE WERE WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND MY DAD WAS TRYING TO FIND SOMEWHERE TO EAT AND EVERYONE WAS FIGHTING AND MY BROTHER WAS CRYING. AND YOU KNOW THE USUAL KIND OF --
Jimmy: FAMILY VACATION. EVERYONE'S HAVING FUN, RIGHT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
SO MUCH FUN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN WE STOPPED AT THE SIDEWALK AND WE WERE ABOUT TO CROSS THE STREET AND THIS GUY WAS SITTING ON THE CURB AND HE LOOKED AT US AND WENT, "MISERABLES." [ LAUGHTER ] "LES MISERABLES."
Jimmy: WE'RE THE MISERABLES FROM LONDON, ENGLAND. YEAH -- DID YOU END UP FINDING SOMEPLACE TO EAT?
WE WENT TO HOOTERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEN WHY NOT, YEAH --
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY -- I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. AND I WAS LIKE, HOOTERS, THAT LOOKS FUN. OWLS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: VERY INAPPROPRIATE TRIP, YEAH.
MY PARENTS ARE GREAT. DON'T WANT TO GIVE A WRONG IMPRESSION.
Jimmy: YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A T-SHIRT FROM THERE.
I GOT A T-SHIRT FROM THERE.
Jimmy: YOU DID GET A A T-SHIRT?
I GOT A CROP TOP.
Jimmy: NO!
I DID.
Jimmy: FROM HOOTERS?
YEAH!
Jimmy: AND DO YOU STILL HAVE IT?
I DON'T THAT, BUT I DO STILL HAVE MY "LES MISERABLE" T-SHIRT.
Jimmy: BECAUSE WE WENT OUT AND GOT YOU SOMETHING --
NO! I LOVE IT. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DELIGHTFULLY TACKY.
OH YES.
Jimmy: THOSE NEW YORK CITY -- A COOL SLEEVE TATTOO TO KEEP YOU WARM IN THE SPRINGTIME.

Jimmy: "SKYLIGHT," BILL NIGHY. I LOVE THIS GUY. HE'S JUST THE COOLEST, COOLEST MOST FUN HUMAN BEING.
HE'S THE BEST.
Jimmy: HE'S SO FUN. THE PLAY IS KIND OF TRICKY. HIS WIFE PASSES AWAY AND THEN AN OLD AFFAIR, OLD FLAME, HE COMES BACK AND REUNITES WITH YOU.
YES.
Jimmy: AND IN THE PLAY, THIS WHAT -- YOU MAKE SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: OKAY? AND YOU GO IT'S ACTING, I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. BUT DO YOU ACTUALLY MAKE SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE?
YEAH, I DO.
Jimmy: AND A WOMAN -- BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING YOU GET EVERY TYPE OF CROWD, AND EVERY AUDIENCE MEMBER.
WE GET GREAT CROWDS.
Jimmy: YEAH BUT ALSO SOME FUNNY ONES. ONE WOMAN'S LIKE --
YEAH, SHE WAS COMMENTING THE WHOLE COOKING PART. SHE WAS LIKE, OH, WASN'T WHISPERING. SHE'S LIKE "OH, MY GOD, IT'S AN ONION." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I WAS LIKE, "YES." AND THEN SHE REPEATED OUT. LIKE EVERY INGREDIENT. "OH, TOMATOES!" [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. SHE JUST REPEATED THE WHOLE RECIPE.
Jimmy: I MEAN, COME ON. YOU ACTUALLY MAKE -- YOU MAKE SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE ON --

Jimmy: I MEAN, DO YOU EAT IT AFTER -- YOU EAT IT IN THE PLAY BUT IT'S NOT YOURS.
I DON'T EAT IT, NO.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
JUST IN CASE I DON'T COOK IT PROPERLY AND THEN I GET SICK.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT WORTH IT, YEAH.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
