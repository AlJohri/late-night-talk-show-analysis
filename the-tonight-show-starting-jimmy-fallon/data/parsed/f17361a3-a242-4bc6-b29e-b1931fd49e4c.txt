Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS -- JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT RIGHT THERE. WELCOME, EVERYBODY, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU ALL MADE IT. THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE SHOW. THIS IS THE ONE TO BE AT. THIS IS IT. YOU GUYS FEELING IT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AT HOME. GUYS, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. BIG NEWS TODAY. DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK HAGEL RESIGNED AFTER SOURCES SAY THE WHITE HOUSE BECAME FRUSTRATED WITH HIS OFTEN EMBARRASSING AND CONTRADICTORY REMARKS, AT WHICH POINT BIDEN QUIETLY STARTED PACKING HIS THINGS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE WAS LIKE -- THAT'S RIGHT. HAGEL RESIGNED AFTER RECEIVING CRITICISM FOR HIS HANDLING OF NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES LIKE EBOLA AND ISIS. ALTHOUGH I THINK WE KNEW IT WAS OVER WHEN HE SHOWED HOW HE HANDLES FURNITURE. TAKE A LOOK.
I HAD AN INCIDENT WITH A A CABINET DOOR. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHEN PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE SAID, "DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU ON THE WAY OUT," THEY MEANT IT LITERALLY. WE DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT. PUT A HELMET ON, SOMETHING. WE DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT ANYMORE. "I HAD AN INCIDENT WITH A A CABINET DOOR." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DURING A RECENT INTERVIEW WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT AFTER HIS PRESIDENCY, VOTERS WIIL WANT A, QUOTE, NEW CAR SMELL IN 2016. YEAH. AND AMERICANS ARE LIKE, ACTUALLY, "WE JUST WANT TO FINALLY PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION. WE JUST WOULD LIKE TO GO. WE JUST WOULD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE JUST WANT TO SEE IT MOVE, ANYTHING. PUT IT IN NEUTRAL, WE'LL JUMP-START IT. OVER THE WEEKEND, PRESIDENT OBAMA PLAYED GOLF WITH DEREK JETER IN LAS VEGAS.
Steve: OH.
Jimmy: YEAH. JETER ENJOYED HEARING OBAMA DESCRIBE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE PRESIDENT WHILE OBAMA ENJOYED LISTENING TO JETER DESCRIBE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE RETIRED. HE'S LIKE, "REALLY? YOU JUST WEAR SWEATPANTS ALL DAY? SOUNDS SO GREAT." AND THIS IS LITTLE EMBARRASSING. LAST WEEK PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS SPOTTED LEAVING THE MARINE ONE HELICOPTER SHORTLY AFTER BOARDING BECAUSE HE FORGOT HIS BLACKBERRY INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. YEAH, HIS BLACKBERRY. [ LAUGHTER ] GOT WORSE WHEN HE HAD TO GO BACK A SECOND TIME TO GET HIS DISC-MAN. HE'S LIKE, "GOTTA HEAR ACE OF BASE FOR THE RIDE." [ IMPERSONATING OBAMA ] ♪ ALL YOU WANT IS ANOTHER BABY SHE'S GONE TOMORROW ALL THAT SHE WANTS ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LIFE OH OH OH OH IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LIFE ♪ OF COURSE, THIS WEEK IN KEEPING WITH TRADITION, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL PARDON A TURKEY DURING A A CEREMONY IN THE WHITE HOUSE ROSE GARDEN. WHEN HE HEARD THAT TED CRUZ WAS LIKE, "ANOTHER EXECUTIVE ORDER? WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS, THE KING?" [ LAUGHTER ] ANOTHER ONE? BUT NOT EVERYONE'S HAPPY ABOUT THIS TURKEY PARDONING THING. IN FACT, PETA IS ASKING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TEENAGED DAUGHTERS TO GO VEGAN FOR THANKSGIVING TO SUPPORT ANIMAL RIGHTS. YEP. AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER REASONS TEENAGERS GO VEGAN ON THANKSGIVING -- JUST TO BE DIFFICULT. [ LAUGHTER ] "I DECIDED FIVE MINUTES AGO I WON'T DO THIS." [ LAUGHTER ] "CAN YOU SHAPE A VEGGIEBURGER TO LOOK LIKE A FLATTENED TURKEY, PLEASE?" THAT'S RIGHT. OBAMA WILL PARDON A TURKEY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. IT ALWAYS GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION. BUT NOBODY EVER FOLLOWS UP ON THE PARDONED TURKEYS AFTER THEY'RE SENT AWAY TO LIVE ON A A FARM. YOU THINK THEIR LIVES WOULD BE GREAT, BUT WE TRACKED THEM DOWN. A FEW OF THEM.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH. HERE'S WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. CARAMEL WAS PARDONED IN 2 2013 BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. AND HE SAID, "AT FIRST IT WAS ALL AUTOGRAPHS, PAPARAZZI, GUESTING ON LETTERMAN. AFTER THE HOLIDAYS, EVERYTHING STOPPED. I OVERREACTED, I FIRED MY MANAGER WHO WAS ALSO MY DAD. WE HAVEN'T GOBBLED ON THE PHONE SINCE." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, JUST, A LITTLE SAD. NEXT UP IS HICKORY. HE WAS PARDONED IN 2 2006 BY GEORGE W. BUSH. HE SAID, "AFTER I GOT PARDONED I WENT ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. BOOZE, PILLS, HUFFING SPRAY PAINT OUT OF A BAG AND JUST TONS OF RANDOM SEX. I HIT ROCK BOTTOM ONE MORNING WHEN I WOKE UP NEXT TO A A CHICKEN -- A RUBBER CHICKEN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SOUNDS AWFUL.
Steve: THAT'S ROUGH. THAT'S ROUGH.
Jimmy: IT JUST SOUNDS TERRIBLE.
Steve: IT WAS BAD.
Jimmy: FINALLY, HOPSCOTCH WAS PARDONED IN 1980 BY JIMMY CARTER. AND HE SAID, "I WAS READY TO GO. I SPENT ALL MY SAVINGS, QUIT MY JOB, FLIPPED OFF MY BOSS AND MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. THEN THEY TELL ME I'M GOING TO LIVE? F-M-L." I MEAN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I GUESS IT'S A BLESSING AND A A CURSE. YOU GUYS SEE THIS LAST NIGHT ON "60 MINUTES"? FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION RAY LaHOOD WAS ASKED ABOUT THE STATE OF AMERICA'S BRIDGES. I CAN'T REALLY TELL HOW WORRIED I SHOULD BE. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID.
THERE ARE BRIDGES THAT NEED TO BE REALLY EITHER REPLACED OR REPAIRED IN A VERY DRAMATIC WAY.
THEY'RE DANGEROUS?
I DON'T WANT TO SAY THEY'RE UNSAFE, BUT THEY'RE DANGEROUS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T WANT TO SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DIE, BUT IF YOU GO ON A BRIDGE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] CONFUSING. GUYS, LISTEN TO THIS, DURING A A RECENT INTERVIEW, "GAME OF THRONES" ACTRESS NATALIE DORMER SAID THAT THE SERIES COULD USE SOME MORE MALE NUDITY. YEAH, SO IT'S GOING TO BE AWKWARD DURING A NUDE SCENE WHEN AND ACTOR'S LIKE, "SORRY, WINTER IS COMING." [ LAUGHTER ] IT CAME A LITTLE EARLIER TODAY, I BELIEVE. A LITTLE BRISK OUTSIDE. AND EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THIS. LAST NIGHT NEW YORK GIANTS WIDE RECEIVER ODELL BECKHAM JR., OH, MY GOSH. [ CHEERS ] HE MADE WHAT PEOPLE ARE CALLING THE CATCH OF THE YEAR. THIS IS IT. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. CHECK OUT THIS CATCH.
I DON'T THINK HE STEPPED OUT EITHER. THAT MAY BE THE GREATEST CATCH I'VE EVER SEEN.
HE'S ON THE 39, THE 40. TOUCHDOWN.
YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME. THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.
Jimmy: YEAH, HE SNAGGED THAT THING LIKE A MIDDLE-AGED BRIDESMAID GOING AFTER THE BOUQUET. LIKE, "OUT OF MY WAY! I GOT IT. GET OUT OF MY WAY!" "LOOKS LIKE I'M NEXT IN LINE." ONE HANDED CATCH. AMAZING. ELI MANNING WAS LIKE, "NICE CATCH." AND ODELL BECKHAM WAS LIKE, "CRAPPY THROW." [ LAUGHTER ] GUYS, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A SIGN OF THE TIMES HERE. LAST WEEK COLORADO APPROVED THE WORLD'S FIRST CREDIT UNION THAT SPECIALIZES IN MARIJUANA BUSINESSES. YEAH. SO IF YOU THINK THE LINE IS SLOW AT YOUR BANK -- [ LAUGHTER ] "201, SORRY, I FORGOT. OH, MAN. I NEED YOUR NAME AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. OH, MAN, YOU SEE THIS VIDEO ON YOUTUBE?" FINALLY, I HEARD ABOUT A NEW DEVICE CALLED THE SONIC DECANTER THAT CAN AGE WINE AND MAKE IT TASTE BETTER IN JUST 20 MINUTES. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE OTHER WAY YOU CAN MAKE WINE TASTE BETTER IN 20 MINUTES, DRINKING WINE FOR 20 MINUTES. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW.

I'M MIR.I.AM. I WAS THINKING OF OTHER WORDS THAT WERE I AM-Y, BUT THE ONLY ONE IS WILL.I.AM AND MIRIAM. SO I JUST WAS LIKE, I'M GOING TO ROCK MIR.I.AM.
Jimmy: BUT I MEAN, WE WERE HERE. DO YOU REMEMBER THIS? HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN?
YEAH, I CAME HERE TO DO "IT'S MY BIRTHDAY" WITH CODY WISE. AND THEN, AFTERWARDS, WE WERE IN THE BACK, SOUND-CHECKING. I WAS LIKE, "YO, EW." AND YOU WERE LIKE, "DO YOU KNOW THAT?" I'M LIKE, "YO, I LOVE THAT." EVERY TIME YOU GET ONE OF THOSE, I LIKE SHARE THEM AROUND AND SHOW EVERYBODY. BECAUSE IT'S LIKE ONE OF MY FAVORITE SKETCHES THAT YOU DO.

AND THEN, I WENT HOME. A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY, IN OUR INDUSTRY, "YO, LET'S HOOK UP. LET'S CONNECT." AND THEN NOTHING EVER HAPPENS. SO, I WAS LIKE, LET ME NOT LET THAT HAPPEN AND JUST MAKE THE SONG RIGHT NOW. AND THEN EMAIL IT TO YOU. BECAUSE YOU GAVE ME YOUR EMAIL.

EXCEPT FOR IT DIDN'T HAVE YOUR FAST RAP ON IT. THEN WHEN I GOT THE FAST RAP, I WAS LIKE, "OH, MAN, SARA WITH NO "H" IS GOING TO OUT-RAP MIR.I.AM." [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE TARIQ IS GOING TO, LIKE, CLOWN ME FOREVER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO RECORD THE FAST RAP, MAN. THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T WORK WITH COMEDIANS. WE DID THIS PART. IT WAS LIKE -- ♪ RHYMING AND RHYMING AND REPETITIONS ♪ [ MUMBLED RAPPING ] AND I WAS DOING THIS WHOLE THING. AND WE HAD TO DO THE TAKE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. YOU JUST LOOPED THE SONG. AND I COULD JUST SEE YOU IN THE BOOTH. AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, "CAN WE DO IT ONE MORE TIME, GUYS?" [ MUMBLED RAPPING ] SORRY, GUYS. [ MUMBLED RAPPING ] SORRY ABOUT THAT, GUYS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE JUST CHECKING OUT YOUR -- WHAT TIME IS IT? NO, I GOT TO GO. I GOT TO GO. BUT THEN WE RELEASED THE SONG. I SAID, WOULDN'T IT BE COOL IF WE BROKE THE BILLBOARD 100?

BUT I WISH YOU WERE HERE SO I COULD SCREAM, AND JUMP UP AND DOWN. DUDE, THIS IS SO COOL!
I WAS LIKE IN MY TECH MEETINGS. AND, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE -- WHEN SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING AND IT DOESN'T TURN OUT RIGHT, I'M LIKE, "SERIOUSLY?" SO, ONE OF THE INDIAN DUDES THAT WORKED WITH US JUST CAME FROM BANGALORE, INDIA. THEY WERE LIKE -- [ WITH INDIAN ACCENT ] "OH, MY GOSH, WILL.

THEY'RE LIKE, "NO, BUT YOU SOUND EXACTLY LIKE MIR.I.AM. I CANNOT BELIEVE IT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: FIRST OF ALL, I AM MIR.I.AM. AND I CAN SAY, "SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY." [ LAUGHTER ]
HE WAS LIKE, "SERIOUSLY, I SENT IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS IN INDIA. THIS IS WHERE ALL THE VIDEOS -- ALL THE PEOPLE SEEING IT IS PROBABLY IN INDIA." [ LAUGHTER ]
