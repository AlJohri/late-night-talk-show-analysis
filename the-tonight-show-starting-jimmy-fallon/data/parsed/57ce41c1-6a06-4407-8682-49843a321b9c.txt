[ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS IN HIS OFFICE YESTERDAY. IN FACT PRESIDENT OBAMA MET WITH TEMPORARY SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR IN THE OVAL OFFICE, TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE RECENT WHITE HOUSE SECURITY BREACHES. OF COURSE FIRST THEY HAD TO ADDRESS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. NOT METAPHORICALLY, THERE WAS AN ACTUAL ELEPHANT WANDERED INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, SECURITY IS JUST AWFUL. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS IT'S ALL GETTING TO HIM NOW, BECAUSE DURING A A FUNDRAISER YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE UNDERSTANDS FEELING LIKE QUOTE, "THE WORLD IS SPINNING SO FAST, AND NOBODY IS ABLE TO CONTROL IT." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN SCIENTISTS SAID, "WELL THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THE WORLD IS SPINNING FAST AND YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT." SO THAT'S -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A FACT. SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS, A NEW STUDY ESTIMATES THAT ONLY 3.4% OF AMERICANS WILL VOTE IN THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS NEXT MONTH.

YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S KIND OF A ROUGH THING. IT'S NOT FUN.

WHY IS IT THAT KIDS ALWAYS KNOCK ON THE DOOR WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? ANY TIME BUT NOW WOULD BE FINE. BUT I THINK THEY SENSE WHEN THERE'S A DRAMA OR A CRISIS GOING ON.

I WENT TO SEE "KING LEAR," SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK WITH JOHN LITHGOW. IT WAS GREAT.
Jimmy: IT'S AMAZING.
THE PLAY WAS NUTS FOR ME AND I'D BEEN TWEETING FOR LIKE A A COUPLE WEEKS. I JUST STARTED TWEETING AND I TWEETED THIS TWEET.
Jimmy: "AMAZING. SHAKESPEARE, NOT GOOD. NO STAKES, NOT RELATABLE. I THINK I'M REALIZING SHAKESPEARE SUCKS." YOU CAN'T SAY THAT! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
APPARENTLY YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. NO, NO.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.
AND TWITTER WENT CRAZY -- LIKE, SHAKESPEARE, TURNS OUT TO HAVE A HUGE INTERNET PRESENCE, A HUGE TWITTER PRESENCE --
Jimmy: IS SHAKESPEARE ON TWITTER?
NOT HIMSELF, BUT LIKE -- YEAH, NO. AND THEN PEOPLE KEPT WRITING ARTICLES ABOUT IT, AND LIKE -- THE "WASHINGTON POST," THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL," THE NEW YORKER WROTE A WHOLE ARTICLE CALLING ME A DUMBASS -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN LIKE "NATIONAL REVIEW" IT WAS LIKE THE RIGHT AND LEFT ORGANIZED AND AGREED ON ONE THING, AND THAT'S, I AM AN IDIOT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: -- JUST AWFUL FEEDBACK. PEOPLE CAN JUST BE SO CRUEL. THEY --
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I'M ON PUBLIC BROADCASTING. I THINK IT'S LIKE, BECAUSE I'M ON PUBLIC BROADCASTING. PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND SHAKESPEARE, YOU GUYS ARE ON THE SAME TEAM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOUR FACE IS ON THE TOTE BAG.
EXACTLY. IT'S AS IF -- IT'S AS IF MR. RODGERS HAD TWEETED -- KERMIT IS AN ASS[ BLEEP ]. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO. YEAH. NO. HE WOULD NEVER DO THAT. MR. RODGERS WOULD NEVER DO THAT. HE WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THAT.
BECAUSE HE WOULD GET THE SAME REACTION.
Jimmy: MR. RODGERS WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THAT. SAME REACTION. BUT HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR OPINION ABOUT SHAKESPEARE?
I MEAN, I THINK THERE THAT ARE CERTAIN THINGS --
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH, ARE YOU SKATING AROUND THE ISSUE.
NO.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH. YOU THINK SHAKESPEARE SUCKS.
I DON'T THINK SHAKESPEARE SUCKS, NO, I DON'T, I'VE SEEN A A LOT OF SHAKESPEARE PLAYS LATELY, WHICH IS WHY --
Jimmy: WHY TORTURE YOURSELF?
-- I JUST REALIZED THAT I'M NOT CONNECTING 'CAUSE THEY'RE INTERESTING, THEY'RE BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. BUT SOME OF THEM, YOU JUST DON'T CONNECT TO EMOTIONALLY. IN THE SAME WAY "LEAR" IS SORT OF FAMOUSLY LIKE A PLAY, SINCE I TWEETED THIS. I FIND OUT A LOT ABOUT THIS, THAT LIKE -- THAT FOR YEARS PEOPLE HAVE PROLONGED -- GOING BACK TO LIKE A CENTURY OR MORE, PEOPLE HAVE SAID THIS IS GREAT PLAY TO READ, BUT LIKE THERE'S THESE LONG MAD SCENES THAT GO ON REALLY, REALLY LONG. THERE'S THESE B PLOT CHARACTERS THAT ARE KIND OF CARTOONISH. I STAND --
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT YOU'RE CRITICIZING SHAKESPEARE. IT'S SO FUN. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
I HAVEN'T REALLY CHANGED.
Jimmy: --  YOUR OPINION. BUT NOW TWITTER HAS CHANGED THEIR OPINION, THEY'RE BACK TO LOVING YOU AND PEOPLE ARE BEING NICE TO YOU.
I FINALLY HAD IT -- THIS WEEK IT WAS LIKE I HAD MY FIRST ACTUAL REALLY GOOD EXPERIENCE ON TWITTER WHERE IT'S LIKE OKAY, THIS IS IT. SOMEBODY TWEETED THAT THEY SAW ME IN NEW YORK ON EIGHTH AVENUE AND THEY WERE LIKE, "IRA GLASS, DID WE SEE YOU BY THE STORE 16 HANDLES?" AND I WAS LIKE, "I WAS BY THE STORE, BUT I WOULD NEVER WALK IN, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE NAME OF THAT SHOW IS DISRESPECTFUL TO MOLLY RINGWALD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: 16 HANDLES. IT'S A --
FROZEN YOGURT STORE.
Jimmy: FROZEN YOGURT STORE, YEAH. IT HAS 16 HANDLES.
AND THEN MOLLY RINGWALD TWEETED "I ENDORSE THIS TWEET." I WAS LIKE, "OH, THIS IS HOW THE WHOLE SYSTEM --
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S HOW COOL MOLLY RINGWALD IS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND YOU -- WEIRDLY ENOUGH, MOLLY CAME -- SHE'S BACK STAGE RIGHT NOW, SHE CAME WITH YOU.
BECAUSE WE'RE PERFORMING IN NEW YORK, SO YEAH.
Jimmy: HOW FUN IS THAT? MOLLY RINGWALD, HOW COOL IS THAT, AND SHE'S PERFORMING AT THE --
HOTEL CARLYLE.
Jimmy: AND SHE'S ALSO A A GUEST ON YOUR SHOW?
SHE HAS DONE A STORY FOR OUR SHOW WHICH IS SWEET OF HER.
Jimmy: THAT'S SUPER COOL. I MEAN -- I SAW THAT ON TWITTER. I GO, "THAT'S COOL, MOLLY RINGWALD LIKES YOU" BUT ALSO I SAW THAT SOMEONE TWEETED OUT, THERE'S A HALLOWEEN COSTUME, THAT PEOPLE CAN DRESS UP LIKE YOU FOR HALLOWEEN --
CHILDREN, CHILDREN.
Jimmy: CHILDREN, FOR JUST YOUR KIDS THAT WANT TO BE IRA GLASS. THIS IS THE COSTUME. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, THAT'S FANTASTIC. THAT IS THE COSTUME. HOW FUN IS THAT? IF A KID CAME TO YOUR DOOR TRICK-OR-TREATING DRESSED LIKE YOU --
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW IT'S ME? IT COULD BE STEVE HIGGINS. IT COULD BE ANYBODY -- ANY KID -- IT'S JUST A SUIT.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S A SUIT. BUT IT'S THE WHOLE IDEA, TOO.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST, YEAH.
I FEEL BAD --
Jimmy: TRICK-OR-TREAT. SHAKESPEARE SUCKS. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO SAY. NO THAT'S A GOOD COSTUME. I THINK IT'S FUN. I LOVE THAT STUFF. WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS PODCAST.
YES.
Jimmy: OF COURSE "THIS AMERICAN LIFE" IS FANTASTIC AT THAT. THIS IS A NEW THING, YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY, YOU'RE NOT, THIS ISN'T YOUR VOICE.
NO, NO, IT'S HOSTED BY SARAH KOENIG WHO IS ONE OF OUR LONG-TIME PRODUCERS. AND BASICALLY THE IDEA OF IT, THE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT IT IS THAT IT'S A STORY THAT TAKES 12 EPISODES TO UNFOLD. IT'S A MURDER THAT HAPPENED IN 1999 --
Jimmy: IT'S A REAL STORY?
IT'S A TRUE STORY. AND -- AND THE QUESTION IS, WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THIS CASE. AND IT TAKES THAT LONG TO UNFOLD. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN AMAZING ABOUT IT IS THAT AS SARAH HAS BEEN REPORTING IT, SHE TOTALLY LIKE FLIPS BACK AND FORTH. LIKE, SHE REALLY THINKS, "OH, MY GOD, SOMEBODY WAS CONVICTED FOR IT." IT'S A HIGH SCHOOL KID WHO MURDERED -- WAS -- WHO WAS CONVICTED FOR MURDERING HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND. AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THING, YOU THINK LIKE "OH NO, HE DIDN'T DO IT." LIKE -- AND THERE'S ALL THIS EVIDENCE. AND THEN, THEN -- LIKE, THEN SHE WOULD GO THROUGH PHASES, AND IN THE SHOW IT HAPPENS, TOO. SHE TOTALLY IS LIKE "OH NO," WELL SHE DOESN'T SAY THIS. WELL YOU JUST TOTALLY FEEL LISTENING TO IT. OH MY GOD, HE MIGHT HAVE DONE IT AND YOU FLIP BACK AND FORTH --
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE INTERVIEWING ACTUAL PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE?
YEAH, IT'S REPORTING, AND SO NOBODY HAS DONE THIS BEFORE, WE THINK OF DOING A RADIO SHOW OR PODCAST WHERE BASICALLY LIKE IT HOOKS YOU IN LIKE AN HBO SERIES, WHERE YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
Jimmy: YEAH, I LOVE THAT STUFF. I LIVE FOR "DATELINE" AND ALL THIS STUFF. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS IS NOT ON THE RADIO. THIS IS ONLY PODCAST --
IT'S A PODCAST AND WE REALIZED AT THE BEGINNING WE STARTED TO PUBLICIZE IT, WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHEN WHY STARTED TO PUBLICIZE, LIKE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A A PODCAST IS HERE YET.
Jimmy: NOT YET.
Jimmy: YOU MADE A NICE LITTLE VIDEO FOR US TO SHOW PEOPLE HOW EASY IT IS --
WE REALIZED, RIGHT, TO EXPLAIN LIKE HERE IS HOW YOU WATCH, HERE'S HOW YOU LISTEN TO A PODCAST.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU SAID WATCH THE PODCAST.
I KNOW, BECAUSE I GOT THROWN OFF.
Jimmy: YEAH, NO. YOU DON'T WATCH IT, YEAH. BUT WATCH THIS -- TO SHOW YOU HOW TO LISTEN.
I HAD ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS DO THIS.
Jimmy: WHO IS YOUR ACTUAL NEIGHBOR?
YEAH AND A FRIEND FROM THE DOG PARK AND SHE LISTENS ON HER iPAD. AND I THOUGHT, YOU'RE THE PERFECT FRIEND TO EXPLAIN --
Jimmy: A FRIEND FROM THE DOG PARK. YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S AN OLDER PERSON DISCUSSING HOW TO DO THIS. WATCH THIS, PLEASE.
