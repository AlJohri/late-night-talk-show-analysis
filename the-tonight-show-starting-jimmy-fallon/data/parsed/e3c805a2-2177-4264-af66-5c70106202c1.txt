Jimmy: NO, I MEAN, PLEASE. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO HAVE YOU ON. BUT OF COURSE, I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE JUST TIRED. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, YOU'RE ALWAYS -- YOU'RE PERFORMING EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE JUST UNBELIEVABLE. AND I JUST WANT TO JUST UNDERSTAND THIS. LIKE THIS, WHAT YOU'VE DONE -- THIS IS AN ICONIC ROLE FROM THE HISTORY OF BROADWAY NOW. WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH KING GEORGE III, THIS IS YOU RIGHT HERE.
OH, BOY.
Jimmy: YEAH, THIS IS WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I SAW YOU -- I WENT WITH MY WIFE TO GO SEE YOU, AND YOU COME OUT AND YOU JUST DESTROY. YOU SING, UNBELIEVABLE. "YOU'LL BE BACK" AND YOU JUST -- YOU'RE MAKING -- LIKE YOU'RE BEING FUNNY ON TOP OF SINGING AND DANCING. I GO -- AUDIENCE, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL HOW MUCH THEY LOVE YOU. THEY LOVE YOU AND I WAS LIKE -- I WAS SO -- SERIOUSLY, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. AND I WAS ACTUALLY SITTING BACK GOING, "THIS GUY IS THE MOST TALENTED GUY." I'VE NEVER SEEN -- YOU JUST DESTROY. YOU WERE MAKING ME LAUGH, AND THEN YOU CAME BACK OUT AND ALMOST GOT A STANDING OVATION JUST COMING BACK OUT AND I GO, "OH, YEAH, WE ALL MISSED YOU!" [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK -- I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES I'VE EVER, EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. IT'S THAT AMAZING. AND HERE'S WHAT'S CRAZIER. SO "HAMILTON," THE ORIGINAL CAST RECORDING THAT THE ROOTS -- QUESTLOVE AND TARIQ TROTTER DID IT WITH LIN-MANUEL AND PRODUCED IT. YOU GUYS WON A GRAMMY TOGETHER.
YEAH.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS ON WINNING A GRAMMY AWARD -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -- FOR "HAMILTON." IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN ANYMORE. AND THEN NOW THEY'RE COMING OUT SOON WITH A THING CALLED THE "HAMILTON" MIX TAPE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: NOW, THIS IS DIFFERENT PEOPLE DOING THEIR TAKES ON VERSIONS OF THE SONGS. AND I DON'T KNOW WHO IS ON IT OR IF ANYTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS. BUT I RECORDED A VERSION OF "YOU'LL BE BACK."
YES, YOU DID. AND IT IS INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S SO GOOD. YES, IT IS.
Jimmy: I'M JUST IN A BOOTH, AND QUESTLOVE IS THERE, AND LIN WAS THERE AND PRODUCERS, AND WE'RE IN THIS SOUND THING AND RECORDING AND I'M TRYING TO SING -- ♪ DA DA DA DA DA ♪ AND I'D GO, "OH, SORRY, THAT WAS OFF, GUYS. I APOLOGIZE." ♪ DA DA DA DA -- ♪ I GO, "OH, I CAN'T DO THIS." I'M OFF-KEY AND I'M SWEATING, AND I'M -- FLOP SWEAT AND I GO, "THIS GUY HAS TO DRESS UP IN A A FULL KING'S OUTFIT, AND DANCE, AND ACT, AND HE'S NOT SWEATING. HOW AM I DOING THIS, AND SWEATING? YOU WERE TELLING ME THE THING THAT YOU DO, THERE'S AN ORDER -- 'CAUSE RORY O'MALLEY IS TAKING OVER.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: AND YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE, BUT THERE'S A A CHANGING --
YEAH. YEAH, SO WHAT BRIAN D'ARCY-JAMES ORIGINATED THE KING OFF-BROADWAY, AND I WHEN I CAME IN TO REPLACE HIM, HE CREATED THIS WHOLE THING CALLED THE ORDER OF THE GARTER. I WEAR THIS, LIKE, SPANGLY GARTER ON MY LEG. AND SO HE WROTE UP THIS WHOLE SCRIPT, AND IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CAST PRESENTED ME WITH THE GARTER AND READ THIS THING AND PUT IT ON MY LEG. AND WHEN ANDREW RANNELLS CAME INTO THE CAST, I THEN -- BRIAN SHOWED UP AND I PUT THE GARTER ON HIM, AND NOW ON SATURDAY, RIGHT BEFORE MY FINAL SHOW, RORY WILL COME ON STAGE AND BRIAN WILL BE THERE. AND HOPEFULLY RANNELLS WILL SKYPE IN AND WE'LL DO THE ORDER OF THE GARTER FOR RORY AS WELL.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS. I MEAN, THAT'S GOTTA BE -- IT'S EMOTIONAL, THAT'S A BIG MOMENT.
YEAH. AND I -- I -- IN HONOR OF YOU SINGING "YOU'LL BE BACK," HAVE BROUGHT THE GARTER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. WHOA. YOU REALLY HAVE! THAT'S THE GARTER. REALLY?
I NOW, WITH YOUR PERMISSION, WOULD LIKE TO PERFORM AN HONORARY CEREMONY, THE ORDER OF THE GARTER, IN HONOR OF YOUR PERFORMANCE OF "YOU'LL BE BACK." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
