OH, JIMMY, I'M SO PLEASED TO BE HERE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW, I'M READING, YOU KNOW, MY NEWSFEED. AND I'M SCROLLING THROUGH EVERYTHING. AND YOU SEE PEOPLE GOING ON TWITTER RANTS, AND THEN MEMES AND, "I JUST ATE CHIPOTLE, YUM." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU SEE AN ELOQUENT 500-WORD ESSAY BY DAN RATHER. AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR BEING A VOICE OF REASON ON SOCIAL MEDIA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: I'M VERY CURIOUS, WHY FACEBOOK?
WELL YOU KNOW, SLOWLY GETTING ON TO FACEBOOK, BEING OLD SCHOOL. BUT, I WORK WITH A A YOUNG STAFF AT MY PRODUCTION COMPANY AND NEWS OPERATION CALLED, NEWS AND GUTS. AND THEY CAME TO ME. THEY SAID, DAN, YOU'VE GOT TO BE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO FACEBOOK. IF YOU WANT TO BE RELEVANT, IF YOU WANT THE BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION, IF YOU WANT TO DO JOURNALISM THAT MATTERS, THEN YOU HAVE TO GET ON IT. SO I SAID, WELL, I'LL TRY IT. I WAS TOLD, BY THE WAY, WRITE NO MORE THAN TWO PARAGRAPHS. BUT I SAID LISTEN, I'M GOING TO WRITE MY HEART. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS AN AUDIENCE FOR THE HOPEFULLY WELL-THOUGHT-OUT ESSAY. BUT IT'S BEEN A REAL EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
Jimmy: YEAH. TRUMP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESS, HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN 60 YEARS OF --
NO, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. NEITHER HAS ANYBODY ELSE. LHLH WE'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING EVEN APPROACHING THIS. THE CLOSEST WE'VE HAD WAS DURING THE PRESIDENCY OF RICHARD NIXON. BUT EVEN THEN, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF DID NOT SO OFTEN, SO OPENLY AND SO PERSONALLY ASSAULT AND ATTACK NOT JUST THE PRESS AS AN INSTITUTION BUT INDIVIDUAL PRESS MEMBERS AS WELL. WE'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING EVEN APPROACHING THIS AT ANY TIME THAT I CAN REMEMBER. YOU GO THROUGH HISTORY. IT JUST HASN'T HAPPENED.
Jimmy: WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO THE MEDIA, TO THE JOURNALISTS OUT THERE?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, STAY STEADY, STAY RESPECTFUL, BUT ALSO BE RELENTLESS AND REMAIN AGGRESSIVE. THAT'S THE PROPER ROLE OF THE PRESS. OUR ROLE IS PART OF THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES, IS TO ASK QUESTIONS, KEEP ON ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS, DO DEEP DIGGING, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. AND I THINK THE PUBLIC, INCLUDING THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP BY AND LARGE, UNDERSTAND THAT'S A VITAL ROLE. IT DOESN'T HELP WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS SO NEGATIVE ABOUT THE PRESS, BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. FOR EXAMPLE, HIS PRINCIPAL ADVISOR MR. STEVE BANNON RECENTLY SAID ALMOST DIRECTLY THE PRESS NEEDS TO SHUT UP. WELL, OUR ANSWER TO THAT HAS TO BE, WITH RESPECT, SIR, NO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHUT UP. NOW ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTION. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: RIGHT. LET'S TAKE DONALD TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION BAN.
HONEST, DECENT, INTENDING PEOPLE OF ALL PERSUASIONS CAN AGREE THAT WE NEED SOME FORM OF IMMIGRATION REFORM. BUT, IT NEEDS TO BE CAREFULLY THOUGHT OUT, NOT SUDDENLY DONE OVERNIGHT THAT CAST CHAOS, CONFUSION, AND HEARTBREAK. THAT SOMETHING THAT'S MEASURED, SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ONLY WELL THOUGHT OUT, BUT EFFECTIVE QUITE WELL. I THINK A LARGE PART OF THE COUNTRY CAN GET BEHIND THAT. BUT THIS IS -- THIS MAKES US LOOK BAD TO THE WORLD, AND IT ALSO GIVES GREAT FUEL TO ALL OF OUR ENEMIES, GREAT PROPAGANDA FUEL. THEY LOVE TO SEE THIS SORT OF THING HAPPENING.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT OR WHO ARE, YOU KNOW, ARE PROTESTING?
AGAIN I USE THE WORD "STEADY," AND DON'T GET AFRAID. DON'T BE SCARED. IT'S THE NATURAL INCLINATION. ALSO, ORGANIZE AND GET TO THE POLLS. THE EVENTUAL LEVERAGE IS AT THE POLLS. YOU CAN'T WIN AT THE POLLS UNLESS YOU HAVE A SUSTAINED EFFORT TO GET -- TO BE ORGANIZED, TO GET YOURSELF TO THE POLLS AND GET OTHER PEOPLE TO THE POLLS. NOW, I ALSO THINK THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO REACH OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE. AND YOU'RE SAYING WHAT CAN I DO AS ONE PERSON? YOU CAN REACH OUT OTHER PEOPLE. PARTICULARLY REACH OUT TO PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT POLITICAL PERSUASIONS, I THINK IT WOULD HELP IF THEY WERE OF A A DIFFERENT RACE. TALK TO THEM, REASON WITH THEM, TRY TO REACH COMMON GROUND. THAT'S THE WAY THAT WE COME TOGETHER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I ALSO THOUGHT, JIMMY, LOOKING FOR SOME SHORT WAY TO SYNTHESIZE THIS AND THE EXPRESSION, "HUH" COMES TO MIND. H-U-H, IN MY OWN MIND, WE NEED HEALING, UNITY AND HOPE. HUH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I LIKE THAT. IT'S NOT LIKE --
I'LL GIVE YOU AN IDEA. I THOUGHT ABOUT HAVING A A T-SHIRT PRINTED UP WITH "HUH." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, HUH. NOT LIKE HUH? IT'S LIKE HUH. [ LAUGHTER ] I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT IDEA. I THINK "HUH" COULD TAKE OFF. ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND I DON'T THINK THE ISSUE'S REALLY BEEN BROUGHT UP ENOUGH IS CLIMATE CHANGE. AND YOU HAD THIS IDEA THAT I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY BRILLIANT TO HAVE LIKE MAYBE A MONUMENT BUILT, DO YOU REMEMBER THIS, IN MIAMI MAYBE? YOU SAID, AT SEA LEVEL?
I HAD A POST THAT STARTED OUT TO BE KIND OF TONGUE IN CHEEK.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SAYING THAT CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS, WE SHOULD BUILD A A MONUMENT TO THEM AND ENGRAVE THE NAMES OF EACH AND EVERY ONE ON THE MONUMENT BECAUSE HISTORY'S GOING TO JUDGE. AND HISTORY'S GOING TO JUDGE VERY BADLY. PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE VIEW, "OH, THERE'S NOTHING TO CLIMATE CHANGE" OR AS THE PRESIDENT SAID DURING THE CAMPAIGN, SAY IT WAS A HOAX THAT THE CHINESE PERPETRATED. I MEAN, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. SO MY IDEA WAS, WE'LL PUT A A MONUMENT. PUT IT IN MIAMI, WHERE THE WATER'S GOING TO RISE AS CLIMATE CHANGE GETS WORSE, AND ENGRAVE ON IT THE NAMES OF EACH ONE OF THESE CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS. I DON'T EXPECT IT WILL COME ABOUT, THOUGH.
Jimmy: YEAH, NO. I JUST LIKE THE IDEA. THAT WAS VERY CREATIVE. I WATCHED YOUR SHOW. CONGRATS ON THAT, "THE BIG INTERVIEW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FEBRUARY 14th.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THE FIFTH SEASON, FEBRUARY 14th. VALENTINE'S DAY. IT'S YOU AND KID ROCK. WHO ARE TWO PEOPLE I DON'T THINK I WOULD SEE TOGETHER HAVING A CONVERSATION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WELL, YOU KNOW, I REALLY ENJOYED MEETING KID ROCK AND TALKING TO HIM. THE DUDE RUNS DEEP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT YOU SHOULD PUT ON A T-SHIRT. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. THE DUDE RUNS DEEP, YEAH.
AND THEN AFTER THAT, THAT'S OUR OPENING PROGRAM ON FEBRUARY 14th.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND AFTER THAT, WE'LL HAVE THE LIKES OF SHERYL CROW, AND ICE CUBE AMONG OTHERS AS THE SEASON RUNS ON. AND I APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONING IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: I THOUGHT IT WAS SO -- IT WAS GREAT. YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ] AND AGAIN, I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE AND WE LOVE SEEING YOU DO THE INTERVIEWS ON AXS TV. BUT I DO MISS YOU AS A A BROADCASTER. SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND READING ONE OF YOUR FACEBOOK ESSAYS FOR US TONIGHT. YOU CAN READ IT TO THAT CAMERA.
WELL, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IF YOU'D DO US THAT HONOR.
I'LL DO MY BEST, JIMMY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: PLEASE.
AS A RECURRING HEADLINE, AS WE DOCUMENT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST DAYS IN OFFICE, THERE WAS THIS. PRESIDENT TRUMP DECLARES WAR ON "BLANK." MEXICO, IMMIGRANTS, WOMEN, SCIENTISTS, THE GOP ITSELF, JOURNALISTS. A DIZZYING ATTACK ON A A CROSS-SECTION OF PEOPLE AND HIS EXECUTIVE ACTIONS OF HIS FIRST DAYS EMPHASIZE DIVISION AND DISRUPTION. AMERICANS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE SCARED. I, TOO, HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS. BUT I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THIS. ON JANUARY 20th, SO MANY AMERICANS CAME OUT TO WASHINGTON, D.C., TO WITNESS THE INAUGURATION OF OUR 45th PRESIDENT. AND THE NEXT DAY A SEA OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN THE WOMEN'S MARCH ON WASHINGTON. INSTEAD OF COMPARING THE NUMBERS BETWEEN THE TWO DAYS OR ANY OTHER DAYS, FOR THAT MATTER, IF YOU COMBINE THE NUMBERS, IT WOULD GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW MANY AMERICANS ARE ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING IN OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. WHETHER IN SUPPORT OF TRUMP, OR IN PROTEST. AND TO HAVE AN ELECTIVE ACTIVE, IS NOT NOTHING. IN THE DAYS AND MONTHS AHEAD, WE AMERICANS WILL HAVE OUR STRUGGLES. SOME MORE THAN OTHERS. BUT IN THE FATIGUE, OR IN FEAR WE NEED TO COLLECTIVELY REMEMBER ONE THING. THERE ARE CERTAIN TRUTHS THAT ARE NOT ALTERNATIVE. THEY ARE SELF-EVIDENT.
