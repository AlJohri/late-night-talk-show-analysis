THANK YOU, GUYS. THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY TO BE BACK. GUYS, I JUST GOT MARRIED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I THANK YOU. I ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO MY WIFE ON A HOT AIR BALLOON BECAUSE I'M A ROMANTIC. AND HATE HAVING MONEY AROUND. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I ACTUALLY, I ACTUALLY DID IT BECAUSE FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS ANY TIME I WOULD SAY TO MY THEN GIRLFRIEND, NOW WIFE, HEY, I GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, SHE WOULD ALWAYS SAY, OH, IS IT A A HOT AIR BALLOON RIDE? [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD BE LIKE, NO, IT'S NOT. AND I WAS LIKE, OH, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SO ROMANTIC. LIKE IT'S FINALLY GOING TO BE A A HOT AIR BALLOON RIDE. AND TURNS OUT THAT WAS JUST HER FUNNY WAY OF SAYING THE THING SHE WOULD LIKE THE LEAST IN THE WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, SHE HAD A PANIC ATTACK FOR AN HOUR. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LAND A HOT AIR BALLOON EARLY. YOU JUST GOTTA WAIT FOR IT TO CRASH BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THAT INVENTION WORKS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I HONESTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC. GUYS, IF YOU THINK A HOT AIR BALLOON RIDE IS ROMANTIC, BEFORE YOU BOOK ONE, DO THIS SIMPLE TEST. DRAW ON THE GROUND A THREE-FOOT BY THREE-FOOT SQUARE, AND THEN STAND IN THAT SQUARE WITH YOUR BACK TO YOUR BELOVED BECAUSE IT'S TOO SMALL. YOU CAN'T TURN AROUND, WHILE SHE CRAPS HER PANTS FOR AN HOUR. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, AND ADD A WEIRDO. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE A REAL WEIRDO. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE SOMEBODY WHO HAS DEDICATED THEIR LIFE TO HOT AIR BALLOONING. YOU KNOW, A BALLOONER. OR A BALLOONATIC? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OH, A BALLOON PILOT. A BALLOON PILOT? I'M A PILOT. OH, OF WHAT? OF BALLOONS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HAVE HIM RUB UP AGAINST YOU FOR AN HOUR. OOH, ALSO, ADD A BLAZING CRACKLING FIRE INCHES FROM YOUR HEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] AND ARE YOU IN A SUPER UNBREAKABLE HIGH-TECH PLASTIC BOX? NO, YOU'RE IN A BASKET. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MADE OF TURN OF THE CENTURY LAWN FURNITURE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO IF YOU THINK THAT'S ROMANTIC, GET RIGHT IN. LIKE I COULDN'T EVEN PROPOSE IN AIR. SHE WAS SO SCARED, SHE WAS JUST HOLDING ON AND SHAKING. AND I KEPT LIKE, RUBBING HER BACK LIKE, YOU WANT TO TURN AROUND, BABE? SHE WAS LIKE, NO, NO! [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE KEPT DOING THIS. LIKE SHE WAS FLEXING HER KNEES. LIKE, I THINK SHE WAS IN CRASH POSITION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LIKE, IF WE HAPPEN TO PLUMMET 2,000 FEET OUT OF THE SKY, SHE WAS GONNA JUST JUMP RIGHT AT THE END. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL WE LANDED, AND THEN IT WAS EASY. YOU KNOW, SHE WAS JUST SO HAPPY TO BE ALIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, I'LL MARRY YOU. OH, MY GOD, I LOVE THE GROUND. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. I USED TO LIVE HERE AND I LOVE THIS TOWN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GIVE IT UP, YEAH, NEW YORK CITY. THE WINDY CITY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN I LIVED HERE, THERE WAS LIKE A PSA ON THE SUBWAY THAT USED TO SAY, TWO DRINKS AGO, YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN HOME, AND THEN IT WAS JUST A PHOTOGRAPH OF A WOMAN ASLEEP ON THE STAIRS GOING INTO THE SUBWAY. OH, NEW YORK CITY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I LOVE YOU. NEW YORK, JUST WANTS YOU TO STOP, TWO DRINKS BEFORE YOU RANDOMLY FALL ASLEEP ON A HARD IRREGULAR SURFACE. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE DOESN'T EVEN MAKE IT INTO THE SUBWAY, GUYS. SHE JUST LIKE, IF IT'S NOT RAINING, I'M GOING TO BED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT I THINK THE AD WOULD BE BETTER IF IT SAID, TWO DRINKS AGO, YOU COULD HAVE GONE HOME, AND THEN IT WAS LIKE A SERIES OF PHOTOS OF HER LIKE WAKING UP AT CONEY ISLAND, AND THEN HER WAKING UP IN QUEENS, AND THEN HER WAKING UP IN CONEY ISLAND AGAIN. AND THEN HER WAKING UP AT THE AIRPORT, LIKE HOW DID SHE TRANSFER? AND HER WAKING UP ON A FLIGHT TO BELGIUM. LIKE, WHERE DID SHE GET HER PASSPORT FROM? SHE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED TWO DRINKS AGO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
