Questlove: 531, EASTERN NEBRASKA! WOO!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! HELLO! LOOKING GOOD! LOOKING GOOD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: HEY! ENJOY YOURSELF. HEY, THANK YOU! WELCOME! I FEEL THE LOVE RIGHT THERE. I FEEL THE LOVE. THAT IS FANTASTIC. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT MAKES ME FEEL SO GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. IT'S A BIG SHOW, TONIGHT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN. BUT, FIRST, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOU GUYS, THE NFL SEASON KICKED OFF THIS WEEKEND. IT WAS EXCITING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND I READ THAT TWO STARTERS FOR THE BUFFALO BILLS MISSED THE TEAM BUS TO THE GAME, HAD TO TAKE AN UBER -- [ LAUGHTER ] TO THE GAME. THE UBER DRIVER SAID, "GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR FOOTBALL GAME." AND THEY SAID, "AND GOOD LUCK WITH BASEBALL, TEBOW."
Steve: WOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WOW!
Jimmy: GUYS, HERE'S THE LATEST ON THE ELECTION. HILLARY CLINTON HAD TO WALK BACK A COMMENT SHE MADE ABOUT TRUMP SUPPORTERS LAST WEEK. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE REALLY UPSET ABOUT THIS. TAKE A LISTEN.
YOU KNOW, TO JUST BE GROSSLY GENERALISTIC, YOU COULD PUT HALF OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS INTO WHAT I CALL THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CROWD BOOS ] SO, IF YOU'RE KEEPING TRACK, TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE DEPLORABLE, AND HILLARY SUPPORTERS ARE DEPORTABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST SO YOU -- [ APPLAUSE ] JUST SO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE KEEPING SCORE.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY RIGHT NOW IS THAT HILLARY WAS JUST DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA. AND TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE, TRUMP HAS REFUSED TO ATTACK HER WHILE SHE'S SICK AND EVEN SAID, YEAH, THAT HE HOPES SHE FEELS BETTER. AT WHICH POINT, PEOPLE STARTED ASKING TRUMP IF HE WAS FEELING OKAY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "MAYBE YOU SHOULD LIE DOWN, MR. TRUMP." "I HOPE SHE'S TAKING A LOT OF LIQUIDS" -- [ LAUGHTER ] "STAYING HYDRATED." [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS TRUMP REALLY DOESN'T WANT -- DOES WANT HER TO GET BETTER BECAUSE TODAY HE SENT HER SOME FLOWERS AND A BASKET OF DEPLORABLES. ISN'T THAT NICE?
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT. HE'S THOUGHTFUL. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
Jimmy: I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED HERE. WATCH THIS THING. A TRUMP ADVISER NAMED JACK KINGSTON WENT ON A CNN PANEL THIS WEEKEND TO DISCUSS THE ELECTIONS. AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, HE SEEMED JUST A LITTLE STIFF. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
THIS IS EXACTLY THE REASON THAT 115 REPUBLICAN DEFENSE SPECIALISTS ARE SUPPORTING SECRETARY CLINTON AND NOT HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE UNHINGED STATEMENTS. THE KIND OF UNHINGED STATEMENT THAT HE MAKES. [ LAUGHTER ] WEAKENED OUR INTERNATIONAL POLICY AND SHOWS A BLATANT LACK OF SUPPORT FOR OUR ALLIES IN SOUTH KOREA. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "DON'T MOVE!" TO BE FAIR, THAT'S ACTUALLY THE BEST COMMENT ON THE ELECTION I'VE SEEN SO FAR IS, LIKE "I -- I -- I DON'T KNOW." [ LAUGHTER ] "I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON ANYMORE." [ LAUGHTER ] HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN SAW THAT, AND WAS LIKE, "JUST UNPLUG HIM AND PLUG HIM BACK IN. IT HAPPENS TO US ALL THE TIME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE FIX." SOME ENTERTAINMENT NEWS, THE FILM "SULLY" WAS A HUGE HIT THIS WEEKEND. AND NOW, FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS ARE PROTESTING THE FILM BECAUSE THEY SAY IT MAKES THEM LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUYS. THEN GEESE WERE LIKE, "HOW DO YOU THINK WE FEEL?" [ LAUGHTER ] OUR FRIEND BARBARA GOT SUCKED INTO AN ENGINE, AND SOMEHOW WE'RE THE BAD GUYS HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] I HEARD ABOUT A NEW MOVIE COMING OUT THAT CHRONICLES PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST YEAR AT COLUMBIA UNIVERTSITY CALLED, "BARRY." YEAH, IT'S 104 MINUTES LONG, AND THAT'S JUST OBAMA INTRODUCING HIMSELF TO HIS ROOMMATE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S LIKE, "UH, MY NAME IS UH -- BARRY." [ LAUGHTER ] "I LIKE TO HANG OUT ON THE BEACH. MY FAVORITE FRUIT IS AN APPLE." ♪♪ [ APPLAUSE ] REMEMBER THAT? A CALLBACK TO HIS OLD JOKE THAT NO ONE LIKED THE FIRST TIME WE DID IT. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, IN CASE YOU GUYS MISSED IT, LAST NIGHT WAS THE "MISS AMERICA" PAGEANT IN ATLANTIC CITY. AND LIKE ALWAYS, AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PAGEANT, EACH CONTESTANT INTRODUCED HERSELF. IT'S USUALLY A QUICK SENTENCE ABOUT THEMSELVES. BUT THIS YEAR IT, SEEMED LIKE THE CONTESTANTS WERE REALLY INTO GEOGRAPHY. TAKE A LOOK.
FROM THE STATE WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF LIGHTNING STRIKES IN THE NATION, I'M COMING IN HOT. I'M COURTNEY SEXTON, MISS FLORIDA.
WE HAVE OVER 580 ORGANIC FARMS, THIS FIELD IS THE REAL DEAL AT RILEY FIELDS, MISS VERMONT.
OVER 80% OF MY STATE'S LAND IS OWNED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT?
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, MISS COLORADO WAS LIKE, "I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHERE I'M FROM, BUT" -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: 420!
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE EACH OF THEM -- IT'S LIKE EACH OF THEM JUST GOOGLED THEIR STATE RIGHT BEFORE THEY WENT ON CAMERA. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE, "I'M FROM THE GREAT STATE OF TENNESSEE, WHICH IS 900 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT? THAT'S NOT A STAT THAT ANYONE KNOWS. GUYS, GET THIS. THE COMPANY BEHIND MR. CLEAN IS HOLDING AN OPEN CASTING CALL FOR A NEW MR. CLEAN. AND I SAW THAT WOMEN ARE WELCOME TO APPLY. SO IF YOU KNOW A WOMAN WHO YOU THINK LOOKS LIKE MR. CLEAN -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S PROBABLY BEST TO NOT SAY ANYTHING.
Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: LET HER FIGURE IT OUT. "HEY, JUDY, ANYONE EVER TELL YOU" --
Steve: "HEY, HONEY."
Jimmy: "YOU LOOK LIKE MR. CLEAN."
Steve: "WHAT ARE YOU SO MAD AT?"
Jimmy: FINALLY, I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO STAN WAWRINKA FOR WINNING THE "U.S. OPEN" LAST NIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AMAZING MATCH. AFTERWARDS, HE ACTUALLY STOPPED BY "THE TONIGHT SHOW" OFFICES, AND WE HAD A PRETTY INTENSE MATCH OF OUR OWN. CHECK THIS OUT.
HEY, GUYS, I'M HERE WITH "2016 U.S. OPEN" CHAMPION STAN WAWRINKA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WAWRINKA?
DOESN'T MATTER JIMMY.
Jimmy: JIMMY. TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO GO HEAD TO HEAD IN A GAME OF TENNIS, BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, LIKE REAL MEN. I'M TALKING ABOUT "NINTENDO WII TENNIS." [ LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU READY TO DO THIS?

THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I LOVE THE SPEECH. WAS IT EMOTIONAL FOR YOU? WAS IT WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE?
IT WAS KIND OF EMOTIONAL BECAUSE THE MAN THAT RAISED ME, SERGEANT PHILLIP HARRISON PASSED AWAY FOUR YEARS AGO, AND WHEN I WAS YOUNG HE ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT IF I LISTENED TO HIM HE WAS GOING TO PREPARE ME TO MAKE IT TO THE HALL OF FAME. SO IT WAS EMOTIONAL BECAUSE HE WASN'T THERE. BUT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS THERE. MY MOM WAS THERE. KIDS WERE THERE.
Jimmy: YOUR KIDS WERE THERE. SO PROUD OF YOU.
IT WAS A GREAT MOMENT.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT WAS BIG. YOU HAD A GREAT -- YOU GOT A A BIG LAUGH BY THANKING KOBE BRYANT.
YES, I DID. [ LAUGHTER ]

THANK YOU, YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT IS WHY WE LOVE YOU, MAN.
I LOVE KOBE. HE'S A GREAT PLAYER. YOU KNOW, WE JUST HAD A -- WE JUST HAD WORK DRAMA. IT WAS NOTHING -- YOU KNOW, WE HAD -- OFF THE COURT, GREAT RELATIONSHIP. LOVE HIM. LOVE HIS FAMILY. LOVE HIS BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS. BUT WORK DRAMA. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TWO STUBBORN GUYS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING. AND WE WON THREE OUT OF FOUR TITLES.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. [ APPLAUSE ]
I MEAN, I THINK THE STORY WOULD BE BETTER IF WE DIDN'T WIN ANY TITLES. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAD OUR UPS AND DOWNS, WE WON THREE OUT OF FOUR, AND LIKE I SAID HE HELPED ME GET PUSHED OFF THE TEAM AND TRADED TO MIAMI.
Jimmy: COULD BE A GOOD THING. I ALSO LOVE YOU NOW ON "INSIDE THE NBA."
