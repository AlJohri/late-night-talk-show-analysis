YEAH. IT IS A CRAZY, SCARY, CRAZY MOVIE.
Jimmy: YEAH. YEAH. THIS IS BY MY MAN, GORE.
GORE VERBINSKI. HE DIRECTED "THE RING." HE DIRECTED THE "PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN" MOVIES.
Jimmy: HE'S UNBELIEVABLE, IT'S -- GORE VERBINSKI.
YEAH. HE'S AWESOME.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T MESS WITH THAT GUY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THE PREMISE OF IT IS, YOU'RE JUST THINKING YOU'RE GOING TO, LIKE, THIS WELLNESS SPA.
YEAH, THAT'S IT. I WORK FOR THIS WALL STREET MONEY FIRM. IT'S IN TURMOIL. THE CEO OF THE COMPANY HAS GONE MISSING. HE'S GONE TO THIS SPA IN THE SWISS ALPS, AND HE HASN'T GONE BACK. SO I'M SENT TO GO TO THE ALPS, FETCH HIM. BUT THE SPA ENDS UP BEING A A PLACE THAT NO ONE EVER LEAVES. AND IT'S REALLY WILD, CRAZY SINISTER PLACE AND IT SETS ME ON A CRAZY, WILD ADVENTURE.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST GOOD. IT'S A REALLY ORIGINAL THRILLER. I LOVE IT. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S DANE DeHAAN IN "A CURE FOR WELLNESS." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
MR. LOCKHART. EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND YOU ARE SOMEWHERE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE.
AGAIN, I'M LOST. I'M JUST SURELY SOMEBODY WENT BACK TO MY ROOM.
WHAT? THIS IS A RESTRICTED FLOOR. THERE ARE SIGNS EVERYWHERE, SURELY YOU DIDN'T JUST WANDER DOWN HERE BY ACCIDENT. WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR?
I HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY TOOTH.
A TOOTH.
ACTUALLY, IT'S FEELING MUCH BETTER. IF YOU COULD JUST POINT ME IN THE DIRECTION OF MY ROOM.
NONSENSE. WE CAN'T LET YOU GET AN INFECTION. YOU MUST LET US TAKE OF YOU. AFTER ALL, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I'M 32.
Jimmy: YOU'RE 32 YEARS OLD. THAT'S VERY YOUNG. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE FOR 32.
I HEARD PEOPLE GOING "AWW." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, THEY WANNA PET YOU RIGHT NOW. YOU JUST HEAR, "AWW, HE'S SO CUTE." BUT THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. HOW EXCITING IS ALL THIS?
IT'S CRAZY. I MEAN, IT IS A LITTLE SURREAL. I'VE WANTED TO DO MOVIES SINCE I WAS EVEN YOUNGER. [ LAUGHTER ] SINCE I WAS THIS TALL SO --
Jimmy: WHAT WAS THE FIRST ONE YOU REMEMBER DOING?
OH, THEY WERE PRETTY BAD. THEY WERE LIKE, YOU KNOW, HOME MOVIES.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, YEAH.
I CAST MY SISTER.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO! THAT'S THE BROTHER'S JOB?
THAT'S THE OLDER BROTHER'S JOB. HE CASTS HIS SISTER. THEN YOU KILL HER IN THE FIRST LIKE TEN MINUTES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S A HORROR MOVIE. ABSOLUTELY.
THE WHOLE REST OF THE THING IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO KILLED HER AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT.
Jimmy: I GOTTA SAY, WE SAW THE MOVIE HERE BECAUSE I THINK WE HAD EMMA ON THE SHOW SO WE HAD A SCREENING OF IT. WE ALL SAW IT. IT WAS ME AND THE WRITERS AND EVERYBODY AND WE WERE JUST BLOWN AWAY. EVEN JUST BY THE OPENING SHOT, YOU MADE TRAFFIC LOOK -- LOOK AWESOME. AND LIKE ROMANTIC. HONESTLY, THAT MOVIE MADE ME JUST BELIEVE IN LOVE AND JUST MADE ME SO HAPPY. IT WAS POSITIVE AND IT WAS SMART. IT WAS CHOREOGRAPHED SO WELL. BY MANDY MOORE. NOT THAT MANDY MOORE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT ANOTHER PERSON NAMED MANDY MOORE. WHO IS JUST -- IT IS.
YOU SEE THE CREDIT. ANOTHER PERSON.
Jimmy: THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE NAMED MANDY MOORE. AND WE WERE JUST BLOWN AWAY BY IT. AND SO, I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HOST THE GOLDEN GLOBES.
I KNOW. I WATCHED YOUR -- THE COLD OPEN THAT YOU DID -- FOR THE FIRST TIME SITTING THERE IN THE AUDIENCE, SITTING NEXT TO --
Jimmy: OH YEAH, WE DIDN'T SHOW IT TO YOU.
YEAH. SO I WAS SOMEWHAT GOB-SMACKED. I MEAN, IT WAS AMAZING. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU -- I MEAN -- IT SORT OF -- I FEEL LIKE YOU KIND OF ONE UPPED ME WITH THAT. THE CARS ON THE RED CARPET AND EVERYTHING. YEAH YOU HAD THE WHOLE --
Jimmy: I COPIED THE MOVIE. YEAH. WERE YOU WITH RYAN?
I WAS SITTING NEXT TO RYAN AND EMMA AND MY GIRLFRIEND OLIVIA. AND WE WERE ALL KIND OF SITTING THERE. THE PRODUCERS WERE RIGHT BEHIND US. AND AGAIN, I THINK BY THAT POINT I HAD HEARD RUMBLINGS THAT IT WAS --
Jimmy: SOMETHING IN THE OPENING?
PART OF THE OPENING WOULD BE LIKE SOMEWHAT INSPIRED BY THE MOVIE.
Jimmy: WE DID THE WHOLE THING.
YEAH. YOU JUST DID THE WHOLE MOVIE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE DID YOUR WHOLE MOVIE, YEAH. I'M SORRY, WE HAD TO DO IT. I JUST LOVED IT SO MUCH. AND I -- I JUST WANT TO SHOW, HERE IS A A CLIP OF ME. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: BUT THAT -- THAT THING WAS -- I GOT TO MEET THE REAL DANCERS FROM YOUR FILM AND I JUST -- I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. AND THAT SHOT, OBVIOUSLY I'M JUST SPOOFING IT. I'M JUST TURNING AROUND, OUR GREAT DIRECTOR DAN OPSEN. WE HAD OUR EDITOR CHRIS TARTAR WHO DIDN'T SLEEP FOR FOUR DAYS DOING ALL THAT. JUST TURNING AROUND AND DOING THAT SCENE AND WATCHING EVERYONE GET ON TOP OF THE LIMOUSINES AND DANCE. WE HAD STORM TROOPERS AND "GAME OF THRONES" EXTRAS AND THE KIDS FROM "STRANGER THINGS."
THE KIDS FROM, "STRANGER THINGS" WERE AMAZING. THAT RAP, WHO WROTE THE RAP FOR THEM?
Jimmy: TARIQ WROTE THAT RAP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN WE WENT ALL OUT. WHATEVER WE COULD DO, WE WENT ALL OUT AND WE JUST TRIED TO MAKE IT FUNNY.
THOSE DANCERS ARE THE BEST THOUGH. WHEN WE SHOT THE VERSION IN THE MOVIE, IT WAS A HEAT WAVE. IT WAS THE HOTTEST TWO DAYS OF THE YEAR. THERE WAS A HEALTH ADVISORY BEFORE. SO WE'RE LIKE, ON A FREEWAY RAMP, BROILING SUN, AND FOR TWO DAYS STRAIGHT. AND THEY WERE JUST, YOU KNOW, WE DID ABOUT 30 TAKES OF KIND OF EACH SORT OF KIND OF PART OF THE NUMBER THAT WE SORT OF BLEND INTO WHAT LOOKS LIKE ONE TAKE. AND THEY JUST DID IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THEY MAKE IT LOOK EASY.
Jimmy: SOMEONE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE HIDING UNDER A CAR.
OH, YEAH. WELL, HALF-WAY THROUGH -- ACTUALLY SPEAKING OF "STRANGER THINGS" KIDS, IN YOUR PIECE, THE TRUCK DOOR OPENS UP. IT'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. AND THEN OUR KIDS, WHEN WE WERE DOING IT, YEAH, THE TRUCK DOOR DECIDED TO JUST STOP WORKING WHICH TRUCK DOORS SOMETIMES DO WHEN YOU REALLY NEED THEM TO WORK.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE LOSING LIGHT.
AND YOU ARE LOSING LIGHT. AND YOU ARE LOSING MONEY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO I THINK, YEAH, WE DEVISED LIKE A COUPLE CREW PEOPLE BRILLIANTLY DEVISED LIKE A A PULLEY SYSTEM WITH A ROPE. I MEAN, IT WAS REALLY OLD SCHOOL. PEOPLE BEHIND THE TRUCK JUST WAITING FOR, "OKAY, ONE, TWO, THREE." I THINK LIKE MY 60-YEAR-OLD PRODUCER JOINED IN AS WELL JUST KIND OF LUGGING IT AS HARD AS HE COULD.
Jimmy: WOW. THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE A GREAT MOVIE.
YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, YEAH.
Jimmy: COMES TOGETHER. THE TEAM. EMMA AND RYAN, THE CHEMISTRY WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE. THAT ONE -- THAT ONE -- I THINK YOU CALL LIKE MAGIC HOUR, RIGHT? WHERE THE SUNSET IS JUST SO PERFECT, THE COLOR OF BLUE BUT IT'S LIKE GLOWING.
YOU KNOW, I GUESS PROBABLY FROM HAVING LIVED IN L.A., THERE'S A CERTAIN TIME OF YEAR, WHERE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE LIKE IN THE VALLEY, FOR SOME REASON SKY IS EVEN MORE INTENSE THERE FARTHER FROM THE OCEAN. THE SKIES AT SUNSET ARE JUST UNREAL. THEY REALLY LOOK FAKE. WE JOKED THAT LIKE WITH EVERYTHING WITH THIS MOVIE, WE WANTED TO SHOOT REAL LOCATIONS BUT MAKE THEM LOOK FAKE. TRY TO MAKE THEM LOOK SO MAGICAL THAT YOU'RE LIKE, "WELL, THAT HAS TO BE GREEN SCREEN. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY CG." BUT TO DO THAT, YOU HAVE THE MAGIC HOUR. THE SUN SETS FOR 30 MINUTES REALLY. SO YOU HAVE LIKE A 30 MINUTE WINDOW TO DO THIS ELABORATE DANCE NUMBER WITH RYAN AND EMMA WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINING FOR MONTHS UP TO THAT POINT. IT'S A SIX MINUTE UNBROKEN SHOT. SO WE HAD TO CRAM IN AS MANY TAKES AS WE COULD INTO 30 MINUTES.
Jimmy: AND THEY HAVE TO NAIL THAT TAKE. THE SIX MINUTE TAKE.
THEY HAVE TO MAKE IT LOOK RELAXED -- BECAUSE THEY'RE KIND OF FLIRTING AND COURTING. BUT THEN, AS SOON AS IT ENDS, WE HAVE TO GO LIKE, "BACK TO ONE!" THEY HAVE TO RUN DOWN THE HILL, WIPE OFF THE SWEAT LIKE -- [ GASP ] AND THEN -- SO, ANYWAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NICE RUNNING INTO YOU. AND YOU JUST DO IT AGAIN.
Jimmy: THE SOUNDTRACK'S GREAT. THE MUSIC IS GREAT. EVERYTHING IS GOOD. I WANNA SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. HERE'S RYAN GOSLING AND EMMA STONE IN "LA LA LAND." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
