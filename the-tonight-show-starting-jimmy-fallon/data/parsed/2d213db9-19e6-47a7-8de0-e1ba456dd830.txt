IF YOUR WIFE HINTS SHE MIGHT BE IN THE MOOD, YOUR KIDS WILL SENSE IT AND WON'T GO TO BED FOR THREE YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF KIDS, ANOTHER FACT OF LIFE. THE MORE KIDS YOU HAVE, THE WORSE YOUR PARENTING BECOMES. PEOPLE THAT ONLY HAVE ONE CHILD ARE MAKING HOMEMADE BABY FOOD OUT OF ORGANIC VEGETABLES THEY'RE GROWING IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD. BY THE TIME THAT FOURTH KID ROLLS AROUND, YOU'RE SMOKING A A CIGARETTE WHILE YOU WATCH YOUR TODDLER PULL A YEAR-OLD MILK DUD OUT FROM UNDER THE STOVE AND EAT IT. [ APPLAUSE ] TAKE THE CAT HAIR OFF OF IT BEFORE YOU PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH, DUMMY. FACT OF LIFE, 100% OF THE BLACK GUYS THAT SHAVE THEIR HEADS LOOK REALLY, REALLY COOL. 50% OF THE WHITE GUYS WHO SHAVE THEIR HEADS LOOK LIKE THEY JUST MURDERED THEIR PARENTS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT? FACT OF LIFE. FACT OF LIFE. FLYING ON AN AIRPLANE MAKES YOU GASSY. NOBODY EVER TALKS ABOUT THIS. NOBODY EVER ACKNOWLEDGES THIS. WE JUST TAKE OUR ROLL AROUND SUITCASE AND WALK THE BAGGAGE CLAIM, POPPING THEM OFF LIKE A A TRAIL HORSE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FACT OF LIFE. IF YOU WAKE YOURSELF UP WITH A A SNORE, THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS LOOK AROUND TO SEE WHO'S LAUGHING AT YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] FACT OF LIFE. IF YOUR WIFE OR GIRLFRIEND GETS TIPSY, THERE IS A VERY FINE LINE BETWEEN HER TALKING DIRTY TO YOU AND SLEEPING LIKE A A HIBERNATING BEAR. AND BY FINE LINE, I MEAN ABOUT HALF A SIP. IT'S LIKE, YOU WAIT UNTIL WE GET HOME TONIGHT, MISTER, I'M GOING TO TEAR YOU UP. [ LAUGHTER ] [ SNORING ] [ APPLAUSE ] AND ONCE SHE CROSSES THE LINE, SHE AIN'T COMING BACK. LIKE THE PARAMEDICS PUTTING THE PADDLES ON A BODY WITH NO HEAD. YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME. BABY, WAKE UP FOR LIKE ONE MINUTE. 35 SECONDS. GIVE ME 35 SECONDS. [ APPLAUSE ] FACT OF LIFE. WOMEN ALWAYS HAVE MORE QUESTIONS THAN MEN HAVE ANSWERS TO. GREAT EXAMPLE, ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO, I GOT A TEXT ONE DAY, THE TEXT SAID PLEASE PRAY FOR TOM, HE WAS IN A BAD WRECK. I GO THROUGH THE HOUSE TO FIND MY WIFE AND SAID HEY I JUST GOT A TEXT SAID PLEASE PRAY FOR TOM HE WAS IN A BAD WRECK SHE SAID, WAS HE DRIVING? I SAID, I DON'T KNOW, I JUST GOT TEXTED PLEASE PRAY FOR TOM HE WAS IN A BAD WRECK. SHE SAID, WERE CAROL AND THE KIDS IN THE CAR WITH HIM? I SAID, I DON'T KNOW, I JUST GOT TEXT THAT SAID PLEASE PRAY FOR TOM HE WAS IN A BAD WRECK. WERE THE PEOPLE IN THE OTHER CAR HURT? I DON'T KNOW I JUST GOT TEXTED PLEASE PRAY FOR TOM HE WAS IN A A BAD WRECK. DID THEY EVEN HAVE INSURANCE? I DON'T KNOW, I JUST GOT A TEXT THAT SAID PLEASE PRAY FOR TOM HE WAS IN A BAD WRECK. WHAT HOSPITAL DID THEY TAKE HIM TO? I DON'T KNOW, I JUST GOT TEXTED PLEASE PRAY FOR TOM HE WAS IN A A BAD WRECK. SHE SAID, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? I SAID, I KNOW YOU NEED TO PRAY FOR TOM, I JUST GOT A TEXT SAID HE WAS IN A BAD WRECK. YOU GUYS ARE HAVE BEEN GREAT. GOD BLESS YOU THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. OH, MY GOODNESS. THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT. THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT. MORE WITH JEFF FOXWORTHY WHEN WE COME BACK, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS, YOU ARE A FUNNY, FUNNY MAN. THAT WAST -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. HERE'S THE SPECIAL HERE. IT'S ON NETFLIX RIGHT NOW. "WE'VE BEEN THINKING," YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING STANDUP. IT MEANS A LOT TO US ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW" TO HAVE A GREAT COMEDIAN LIKE YOU DO SOME STANDUP.
I'M HONORED THAT YOU -- THANK YOU FOR HAVING COMICS DO THAT, 'CAUSE IT'S ALMOST A LOST ART, YOU KNOW? THAT'S WHAT I GREW UP WATCHING AND WHAT I WANTED TO DO.
Jimmy: WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU DID STANDUP ON A LATE NIGHT SHOW?
MAYBE LIKE 1994? LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW. LIKE, 20 YEARS AGO, MAYBE?
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT? 20 YEARS?
YEAH. TO DO STANDUP, YEAH.
Jimmy: WE'RE HONORED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THAT.
OH, MAN, MY PLEASURE.
Jimmy: I APPRECIATE THAT, 'CAUSE IT'S -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'VE GOT THIS SPECIAL -- ANOTHER SPECIAL. YOU AND LARRY THE CABLE GUY WHO, GOSH, I LOVE HIM AS WELL. HE'S SUPER FUNNY GUY. IS IT EASY TO COME UP WITH COMEDY AFTER ALL THESE SPECIALS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING?
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? NO, BECAUSE IT'S -- THE DIFFERENCE IN MUSIC. YOU WRITE FIVE HITS OF MUSIC, YOU PLAY TILL YOU'RE 90. BUT WITH COMEDY, ONCE YOU DO A A SPECIAL, PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "OH, THAT'S FUNNY. WHAT DO YOU HAVE THAT'S NEW?" AND THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO DO IT BUT TO GO BACK TO LITTLE CLUBS AND START FROM SCRATCH. I HAVE THREE BOXES. I HAVE GOLD, SILVER, AND CERTIFICATE OF APPEARANCE. AND I WILL JUST HAVE JOKES, AND, YOU KNOW, LIKE SHOW UP ON A SUNDAY NIGHT. I KEEP THE CERTIFICATE. THAT MEANS, YOU KNOW, THEY BOMBED, AND SO I KEEP GOING BACK. AND I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN THEY BOMB BECAUSE I CAN ONLY HEAR ONE PERSON LAUGHING, AND IT'S MY WIFE IN THE BALCONY, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S LIKE, "THAT WAS SO BAD, NOBODY EVEN LAUGHED." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SHE'S LAUGHING THAT NO ONE LAUGHED.
SHE LOVES IT WHEN I GO DOWN THE TOILET.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE SHE DOES, YEAH.
BUT THE WHOLE PROCESS OF STARTING FROM A NOTE -- FROM A A FOG, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, LATER ON IT TURNS INTO A A SPECIAL, IT'S JUST A COOL EVOLUTION.
Jimmy: IT'S THE GREATEST THING EVER, AND IT'S SO FUN. AND ESPECIALLY NOW WITH NETFLIX, IT'S LIKE A WHOLE NEW THING THAT PEOPLE JUST WATCH NOTHING BUT COMEDIANS NOW.
YEAH. AND IT'S FUN. WE WERE DOING THIS TOUR, AND WE'RE JUST GETTING GREAT REVIEWS AND GREAT PRESS, AND NETFLIX SAW IT AND SAID, "CAN WE FILM THIS?" I'M LIKE, "YEAH, COME ON." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND YOU LOOK GREAT, I SHOULD SAY. YOU LOOK GREAT. YOU WERE TELLING ME LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, YOU HAD KIDNEY STONES.
OH, MY GOSH. HAVE YOU HAD ONE? HOW MANY -- HAS ANYBODY HAD A A KIDNEY STONE OUT HERE? I -- SERIOUSLY, YOU HAVE -- THE PAIN IS SO -- AND THIS IS HOW I KNEW I HAD IT. I FELT GREAT, I'M IN THE TIRE STORE GETTING TIRES FOR THE TRUCK. ALL -- FEEL GREAT. ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT'S LIKE CHUCK NORRIS KICKED ME IN THE BACK. I MADE A NOISE. I WAS LIKE -- [ SQUEALING ] [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A MASCULINE NOISE. IT WAS A NOISE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN IT HIT ME AGAIN. DEWAYNE, THIS KID THAT'S RINGING ME UP AT THE TIRE STORE, HE LOOKS AT ME AND HE GOES, "HEY. I AIN'T NO DOCTOR --" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ]
I HAD ASSUMED THAT HE WAS. HE JUST DIDN'T LIKE WEARING THE STETHOSCOPE WHILE HE'S CHANGING TIRES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AT THE TIRE STORE, YEAH.
HE GOES, "I AIN'T NO DOCTOR, BUT I THINK YOU GOT A KIDNEY STONE BECAUSE MY BROTHER HAD ONE AND THAT'S WHAT HE ACTED LIKE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND IT WASN'T THAT I DIDN'T TRUST DEWAYNE'S DIAGNOSIS, BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, JEFF, YOU HAVE A LITTLE MONEY, WHY NOT GET --
Both: A SECOND OPINION?
YOU KNOW, SO -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD.
SO I GO TO THE UROLOGIST. AND HE SAID, "YOU DON'T HAVE A A KIDNEY STONE, YOU HAVE FIVE, AND ONE OF THEM IS HUGE." AND WHEN YOU HEAR STONE, AND YOU THINK SMOOTH RIVER ROCK. A KIDNEY STONE LOOKS LIKE A A NINJA DEATH STAR. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, IT'S GOT POINTS AND CLAWS AND HOOKS. AND HE SAID -- WHEN THEY FORM IN THE KIDNEYS THEY DON'T HURT, BUT THEN THEY PASS THROUGH A A TINY TUBE CALLED THE URETER, AND THEY JUST RIP THROUGH NERVES AND BLOOD VESSELS, AND SO -- [ AUDIENCE OHS ] I THOUGHT I KNEW PAIN. I READ ONLINE. THEY SAID THE PAIN OF THE PASSING A BIG ONE WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF A WOMAN GIVING BIRTH WITH NO MEDS. ANY WOMAN HERE DONE BOTH? [ LAUGHTER ] NOBODY? SO -- AND HERE'S MY ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF THE KIDNEY STONE. I SAID, A YEAR OR TWO AFTER GIVING BIRTH, A WOMAN WILL SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M ABOUT READY TO HAVE ANOTHER CHILD." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU NEVER HEAR A MAN SAY, "WELL, I'VE ABOUT QUIT PUKING AND CRYING. I THINK I'LL DRINK A CASE OF COCA-COLA AND SEE IF I CAN WORK UP ANOTHER." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GET ONE OF THOSE STONES GEARING UP.
AND THEY -- HE IMMEDIATELY STARTS WRITING ME A A PRESCRIPTION FOR PERCOCET. AND I'M LIKE, "DUDE, I DON'T TAKE ASPIRIN, I'M NOT TAKING PERCOCET." WHEN THAT THING STARTED MOVING, I'M EATING PERCOCET LIKE THEY'RE PEANUT M&MS. [ LAUGHTER ] I WENT FROM BEING DR. OZ TO KEITH RICHARDS IN ABOUT THREE SECONDS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: JUST THROWING THEM DOWN.
AND IF YOU HAVE ONE, DON'T GO TO THE -- NEVER GO TO THE HOSPITAL, BECAUSE THEY JUST LAUGH AT YOU. ONE NIGHT THE PERCOCET DIDN'T MAKE A DENT, AND SO I SAID TO MY WIFE, "YOU GOTTA TAKE ME TO THE HOSPITAL." AND I GET THERE, AND THE LADY SAID, "WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?" AND I SAID, "I HAVE A KIDNEY STONE." WELL, SHE KIND OF LAUGHED. SHE'S LIKE, "HMM. WELL YOU GON' BE WAITING A LONG TIME TONIGHT, HUN." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I SAID, "NO, MA'AM, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND." I SAID, "I'M IN THE WORST PAIN I'VE EVER BEEN IN." SHE SAID, "WELL, YOU JUST FEEL LIKE YOU GON' DIE, BUT YOU'RE NOT." [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE GIVES ME THE CLIPBOARD, SO I GO TO FILL OUT THE INFORMA -- I SIT IN THE WAITING ROOM. I SIT NEXT TO A GUY THAT'S GOT A KNIFE IN HIS HEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS GUY HAS GOT A KNIFE STICKING IN HIS HEAD. AND I SAID, "OH, MY GOD, WERE YOU IN A FIGHT?" HE GOES, "NO, I GOT A KIDNEY STONE. I DID THIS TO MYSELF SO I CAN GET TO THE FAST TRACK." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. JEFF FOXWORTHY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] "JEFF FOXWORTHY AND LARRY THE CABLE GUY: WE'VE BEEN THINKING" IS AVAILABLE NOW ON NETFLIX. MORE OF "THE TONIGHT SHOW" AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
