Questlove: 440, CLEVELAND!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU, THANK YOU! OH, OH! THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. WELCOME, EVERYBODY, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S A BIG SHOW TONIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. I SAW THAT DONALD TRUMP AND TED CRUZ FEUDED THIS WEEK. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S SOMETHING NEW. THAT'S SOMETHING NEW, YEAH.
Jimmy: THEY WERE FEUDING THIS WEEK AFTER AN ATTACK AD FEATURED A NUDE PHOTO OF TRUMP'S WIFE, MELANIA. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] AND TRUMP THREATENED TO RETALIATE AGAINST TED CRUZ'S WIFE, HEIDI. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] AND WHILE TRUMP AND CRUZ WERE ARGUING, MELANIA AND HEIDI QUIETLY ESCAPED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, DONALD TRUMP IS FURIOUS OVER AN AD FEATURING A A NUDE PHOTO OF MELANIA TRUMP. TRUMP'S MOSTLY FURIOUS BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST TIME HE'S SEEN MELANIA NAKED IN YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND LISTEN TO THIS, I READ THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS HAVING TO HIRE MORE STAFFERS TO REVIEW ALL OF THE REQUESTS THAT ARE BEING FILED FOR HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAILS. OR AS HILLARY PUT IT, "SEE, I'M CREATING JOBS ALREADY. [ LAUGHTER ] I TOLD YOU!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS FOR HILLARY CLINTON. YESTERDAY SHE RECEIVED THE ENDORSEMENT OF "ROLLING STONE" MAGAZINE. WHILE BERNIE SANDERS RECEIVED THE ENDORSEMENT OF "KIDNEY STONE MAGAZINE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I'VE BEEN ON THE COVER MORE THAN ANY OTHER PERSON!" HILLARY ALSO TARGETED DONALD TRUMP'S RECENT COMMENTS ON FOREIGN POLICY, SAYING IF TRUMP GETS HIS WAY, IT WILL BE LIKE CHRISTMAS FOR RUSSIA. THEN RUSSIANS WERE LIKE, "SO, WE ALL GET POTATO IN SOCK?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "IN RUSSIA, SANTA GETS SHOVED DOWN CHIMNEY." THAT'S RIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT IF DONALD TRUMP BECOMES PRESIDENT IT WILL BE LIKE CHRISTMAS IN THE KREMLIN. CHRISTMAS IN THE KREMLIN, WHICH ACTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE AN AMAZING HOLIDAY MOVIE STARRING VLADIMIR PUTIN. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S ON THE HALLMARK CHANNEL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: ON A MARATHON.
Jimmy: IT'S ON ABC FAMILY. FORMERLY KNOWN AS --
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN GAVE A SPEECH ON THE STATE OF AMERICAN POLITICS YESTERDAY. AND IT SEEMS LIKE HE HAD A LOT OF VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT WHAT POLITICS CAN BE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR COUNTRY CAN BE. ABOUT WHAT OUR FOUNDERS ENVISIONED IT WOULD BE. AND THAT IS, WHAT POLITICS SHOULD BE. THAT'S WHAT IT CAN BE. THAT'S WHAT IT HAS BEEN, AND THAT'S WHAT, IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER AND FOCUS ON IT, IT CAN BE AGAIN. THAT IS WHERE IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE, AND WHERE IT WASN'T AND WHERE IT SHOULDN'T BE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SHOULD BE. CAN BE? IS HE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OR THE PHILOSOPHY MAJOR OF THE HOUSE? [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] CAN BE, SHOULD BE. IT SHOULDN'T BE. BE, BE, BE. AS THE OTHER -- THE OTHER BIG STORY THIS WEEK IS THE HULK HOGAN SEX TAPE TRIAL WITH HULK HOGAN POISED TO WIN $140 MILLION IN DAMAGES. OF COURSE HE HAS HIS LAWYER TO THANK FOR THAT. AND IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIS LAWYER, TAKE A LOOK.
WHAT MR. DENTON IS TRYING TO DO IS SHIFT THE FOCUS OF THIS LAWSUIT. THAT LANGUAGE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE TAPE REALLY DOES NOT COME INTO PLAY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AS SOON AS THEY SAW THAT, SUPERCUTS WAS LIKE, "OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S REALLY SAYING SOMETHING WHEN YOU'RE SITTING WITH HULK HOGAN AND PEOPLE ARE STARING AT YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] EVEN DONALD TRUMP WAS LIKE, "NO WAY THAT HAIR IS REAL. THERE'S NO WAY. HE'S WEARING A PIECE!" [ APPLAUSE ] [ DOG GROWLING ] "GOOD BOY. BE GOOD, BE GOOD. [ DOG GROWLING ] ALL RIGHT. [ DOG GROWLING ] OKAY, BOY. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE PARK. I'M GOING TO GO WALK MY HAIR." I THOUGHT THIS WAS INTERESTING, A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT WOMEN WITH NATURAL BLONDE HAIR HAD A A HIGHER AVERAGE IQ SCORE THAN BRUNETTES AND REDHEADS. [ CHEERS ] SO, FOR YOU NATURAL BLONDES OUT THERE, A HIGHER IQ MEANS YOU'RE SMARTER. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S A GOOD THING, IT'S A GOOD THING. IT'S COOL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, I SAW THAT TWO TRUCKS CARRYING BEER AND FRITO LAY'S CHIPS GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT IN FLORIDA. CAUSING SNACKS AND BEER TO SPILL OUT ONTO THE HIGHWAY. SO IF WE JUST ADD A TRUCK FULL OF RECLINERS AND TELEVISIONS, I THINK WE JUST FOUND MY DAD'S RETIREMENT SPOT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS!

AND WE'RE HOOKING THEM UP WITH OUR PARTNERS, USAID AND HOWARD BUFFETT AND STARBUCKS, AND GETTING THEM BACK UP TO PAR AND HOOKING THEM UP WITH PEOPLE WHO WILL BUY THEIR COFFEE ON THE MARKET.

WE MET WHEN I WAS 19. SO JUST LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
I WAS IN A BAND IN COLLEGE CALLED MAXI GEIL. WHICH WAS A KIND OF AN ART-GLAM POP BAND. MAXI GEIL IS GERMAN FOR "SUPER-HORNY." I DIDN'T COME UP WITH THE NAME. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS ME AND, LIKE, A BUNCH OF DUDES AND OUR BASSIST STARTED DATING MOLLY SHANNON.
Jimmy: WHO I LOVE, OF COURSE, FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." WE LOVE MOLLY SHANNON.
AND YOU WERE ON "SNL" WITH HER AT THE TIME. AND THEY GOT SERIOUS, THEY HAD A HOUSE-WARMING PARTY. AND I WENT TO THE HOUSE WARMING PARTY. AND IT WAS, FOR MY 19-YEAR-OLD SELF, IT WAS A VERY GROWN-UP EVENT. I HAD NEVER BEEN AT LIKE A A PARTY WITH CELEBRITIES BEFORE. AND I WAS VERY EXCITED TO MEET YOU, BECAUSE I HAD A BIG CRUSH ON YOU. SO -- [ CHEERS ] THANK YOU, THANK YOU. AND SO I SAID TO MOLLY, WHEN I GOT THERE, I WAS LIKE, "WILL YOU INTRODUCE ME TO JIMMY? LIKE, I HAVE SUCH A BIG CRUSH ON HIM." SHE WAS LIKE, "HE'S SO COOL. JUST GO, LIKE, SAY HI TO HIM, HE'S SUPER NICE." SO I WAS LIKE, "OKAY." SO I WENT TO THE BAR TO GET A A DRINK TO, LIKE, WORK UP MY COURAGE. AND I'M STANDING AT THE BAR, AND YOU WALK UP TO IT. IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US AT THE BAR AND YOU'RE LIKE, "HEY." AND I TURN AROUND AND I LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND I JUST WALK AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ I COULDN'T HANDLE IT. YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: YEAH. I DO. I REMEMBER THAT. ABSOLUTELY. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU REMEMBER THAT. NO, THE STORY DOESN'T END THERE. SO I WALK AWAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I WASN'T READY, YOU KNOW? I NEEDED IT TO BE ON MY TERMS.
Jimmy: IT WASN'T YOUR MOMENT. YEAH.
IT WASN'T MY MOMENT. IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.
Jimmy: OKAY.

THEY'RE NORMAL. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THEY'RE BASIC, THEY'RE NORMAL, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT -- THEY'RE NOT SUPER MODELS, YOU KNOW? AND I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, YOU GOT THIS." YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] SO, SO -- I'M LIKE, "OKAY. THIS IS IT." BUT I NOTICE YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAYING GOOD-BYE TO THESE GIRLS. AND THAT YOU'RE LIKE MAKING YOUR ROUNDS OF GOOD-BYES. I'M LIKE, "OH, NO. THE WINDOW IS CLOSING. YOU'VE GOT TO GO DO THIS." SO YOU GO AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO MATTHEW BROERICK AND AMY SEDARIS -- WHO, FOR ME, AT 19, THIS WAS A A VERY OVERWHELMING TRIFECTA. LIKE, THESE WERE ALL ICONS FOR ME. SO I WAS SUPER NERVOUS AND I THINK THAT I MUST HAVE BLACKED OUT. BECAUSE WHAT UNFOLDS AFTER THIS IS LIKE, INEXPLAINABLE TO ME. SO, I SEE THAT YOU'RE SHAKING THEIR HANDS, I BEELINE FOR YOU. YOU ARE SHAKING -- GOING IN TO SHAKE MATTHEW BRODERICK'S HAND.

Jimmy: I'M SORRY. I'M NOT A GOOD ACTOR. I'M NOT A GOOD ACTOR.
