WE DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: WE WERE BRAND NEW. YOU'RE BRAND NEW TO L.A. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT L.A.
WE DIDN'T HAVE A NAVI SYSTEM. SO WE JUST KIND OF -- JUST KIND OF CRUISING ALONG.
Jimmy: EXACTLY YEAH. SO IT WAS ON SUNSET BOULEVARD -- SO WE KNOCKED ON THE GLASS. AND THE GUY GOES LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU WANT?" WE GO, "WE WANT BEER." [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE GOES, "I CAN'T SELL YOU BEER. WE DON'T SELL ANYTHING HERE. WE HAVE TO DELIVER IT TO YOU." AND WE GO, "BUT WE'VE GOT TO BRING IT TO A PARTY." HE GOES, "I CAN'T. AND YOU PULL YOUR WALLET AND I.D. OUT AND YOU PUT IT AGAINST THE GLASS AND YOU GO, "I'M A A LAKER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
OH, OKAY, COME IN. COME IN.
Jimmy: WE LEFT WITH FIVE CASES OF BEER. WE'RE LIKE HEY. CAME BACK TO THE PARTY -- THAT WAS AWESOME, MAN. I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT. I WAS SO PROUD OF YOU -- I'M WATCHING YOU LIKE I'M YOUR MOM OR SOMETHING. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU LIKE -- I KNEW HIM WHEN. I KNEW KOBE.
NO MAN, YOU'VE BLOWN UP, MAN.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, BUDDY. I APPRECIATE IT. I GREW UP A LITTLE BIT. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS FILM. "KOBE'S MUSE." THIS IS ON SHOWTIME. THIS IS YOUR FIRST THING. YOU HAVE A WHOLE NEW THING NOW, KOBE INC.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IS YOUR WHOLE -- IT'S LIKE A WHOLE SIDE BUSINESS NOW.
WELL, I LOVE TELLING STORIES. TRUE STORIES, RIGHT? FOR ME IT WAS JUST REALLY ABOUT THE PROCESS OF THAT. THE ART THAT GOES INTO THAT. I'D BEEN WORKING WITH NIKE FOR SO MANY YEARS, I ENJOYED THE PROCESS OF CREATING STORIES FOR THE PRODUCT, CREATING CAPTIVATING CAMPAIGNS RIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH. SO FOR THE DOCUMENTARY IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING THAT WAS EASY FOR ME. I CAN'T WRITE BOOKS. I JUST DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO SIT THERE AND LIKE LITERALLY WRITE IT.
Jimmy: YOU WERE INTO POETRY.
I WAS. BUT THEN I REALIZED I CAN'T SPELL FOR [ BLEEP ] SO. [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE. SO YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. YEAH.
SPELLING IS NOT REALLY ONE OF MY STRONG SUITS.
CRAZY.
Jimmy: I'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS. HERE'S YOUR NEW SNEAKER WITH NIKE. [ APPLAUSE ] AND YOU GOT THE "KOBE X'S" AND YOU GOT THEM FOR THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE. THE ROOTS ARE ROCKING THEM RIGHT NOW.
YES SIR. YES SIR. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: BUT I FOLLOW YOU AND I HOPE YOU FEEL THE VIBE AND THE LOVE FOR ME BECAUSE I ROOT FOR YOU ALL THE TIME. AND I REMEMBER WHEN THE SNEAKERS CAME OUT, THEY'RE LOW-TOPS, AND THEY WERE LIKE DON'T PLAY BASKETBALL IN LOW TOPS.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND I WAS LIKE DON'T TELL KOBE WHAT TO DO. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU GO, "REALLY?" SO YOU PUT ON THESE LOW TOP AND YOU SCORED 60 POINTS.
YEAH. OH, YOU CAN PLAY IN LOW TOPS.
Jimmy: YEAH, NOW YOU CAN DO IT. I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. I'M PROUD OF YOU. I MISS YOU. YOU'RE AWESOME.
THANK YOU, MAN.
Jimmy: AND CONGRATS ON EVERYTHING, DUDE. YOU'RE ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER.
APPRECIATE IT MAN. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
