[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WELL, HALLOWEEN IS JUST A A COUPLE DAYS AWAY. YOU GUYS READY FOR THAT? ARE YOU GUYS EXCITED? [ CHEERS ] EVERYBODY IS ALL EXCITED. GETTING IN THE SPIRIT. LAST NIGHT I WATCHED TWO SCARY MOVIES. THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE AND THE METS GAME. [ LAUGHTER ] I COULDN'T SLEEP. I COULDN'T SLEEP. ACTUALLY, DID YOU SEE THE DEBATE? DURING THE GOP DEBATE, BEN CARSON WAS ASKED WHAT HIS GREATEST WEAKNESS IS, AND HE SAID HE COULDN'T SEE HIMSELF AS PRESIDENT UNTIL PEOPLE ASKED HIM TO RUN. YEAH. HE ALSO COULDN'T SEE HIMSELF AS PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE NEVER OPENS HIS EYES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND CARLY FIORINA SAID THAT, AFTER THE PREVIOUS DEBATE, PEOPLE TOLD HER THAT SHE NEEDED TO SMILE MORE. YEAH. THEY WERE LIKE, "JUST PRETEND YOU'RE LAYING OFF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE." [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, THANK YOU. IN HIS CLOSING COMMENTS, RAND PAUL SAID THAT HE IS RUNNING TO CREATE A GOVERNMENT SO SMALL THAT YOU CAN BARELY SEE IT. PAUL SAID IT WOULD BE MODELED AFTER HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THAT. NO, BUT HE DID. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: NICE OF HIM. VERY NICE OF HIM.
Jimmy: ONE OF THE BIG MOMENTS FROM THE DEBATE CAME WHEN A MODERATOR ASKED WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO ABOUT ONLINE GAMBLING AND FANTASY FOOTBALL. CHECK OUT WHAT CHRIS CHRISTIE HAD TO SAY.
WAIT A SECOND. WE HAVE $19 TRILLION IN DEBT. WE HAVE PEOPLE OUT OF WORK. WE HAVE ISIS AND AL QAEDA ATTACKING US, AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FANTASY FOOTBALL?
Jimmy: HA! I LOVED IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVED IT. SPOKEN LIKE A GUY WHO'S DEFINITELY IN LAST PLACE IN HIS FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE. [ LAUGHTER ] I SHOULD HAVE NEVER TRADED ROMO! IN THE EARLY DEBATE LAST NIGHT, BOBBY JINDAL WAS ASKED WHAT SMARTPHONE APPS HE USES, AND JINDAL ADMITTED THAT HE STILL USES A BLACKBERRY. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] EVEN BLACKBERRY WAS LIKE, "BOBBY JINDAL IS STILL AROUND?" [ LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, LINDSEY GRAHAM HAD SOME REAL TOUGH TALK AT THE EARLY DEBATE, AND REALLY BROUGHT OUT HIS TOUGH-GUY VOICE. CHECK IT OUT.
WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH ME, YOU'VE GOT A CLENCHED FIST OR AND OPEN HAND. YOU PICK. THE PARTY'S OVER TO ALL THE DICTATORS. MAKE ME COMMANDER IN CHIEF, AND THIS CRAP STOPS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: OH.
Jimmy: THAT'S ALSO HIS RECIPE FOR KNEADING MUFFIN DOUGH. IT'S LIKE "I TAKE AN OPEN HAND AND A CLENCHED FIST, AND I MASH THAT DOUGH UNTIL IT'S GOOD AND TENDER." SPEAKING OF LINDSEY GRAHAM, I READ THAT HE HAD SOME WHISKEY SHOTS AND BEERS AT A BAR IN COLORADO THE NIGHT BEFORE THE DEBATE. YEAH. IN FACT, IF YOU SLOW DOWN THE AUDIO JUST A BIT, IT SORT OF SOUNDS LIKE HE'S STILL DRUNK. CHECK IT OUT.
THE ONLY REASON I HAVE AN iPHONE IS BECAUSE I GAVE MY NUMBER TO DONALD TRUMP.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE THAT. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, LAST NIGHT, THE ROYALS BEAT THE METS IN GAME TWO OF THE WORLD SERIES. [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] WHICH MEANS THE METS ARE NOW DOWN TWO GAMES TO NONE, AND THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. I MEAN, EVEN MR. MET SEEMS UPSET. TAKE A LOOK AT HIM. HE'S LOOKING SAD.

HASHTAG, YOU WANT TO CHEER UP MR. MET? OKAY, GOOD. YOU BROUGHT A JOKE. OH, OF COURSE, I'LL READ THIS FOR MR. MET. WHAT DO METS FANS DO WHEN THE ROYALS HIT A HOME RUN?
WHAT?
Jimmy: THEY BAMBOO. THAT WAS GREAT! THANK YOU, HASHTAG THE PANDA. THAT WILL CHEER UP MR. MET. HASHTAG, EVERYBODY. GET OUT OF HERE. ♪♪ [ CHEERS ] ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] OH, MY GOD.

I DON'T THINK YOU LIKE ME. I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BEFORE YOU ANSWER. BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. I GO TO THE GAME, VERY EXCITED. SOMETIMES I WEAR YOUR SHIRT. ANYTHING. YOU KNOW, LIKE WAVING AT YOU. AND, YOU KNOW, LORNE MICHAELS HAS REALLY GOOD SEATS. WE SIT RIGHT BEHIND HOME PLATE. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. THE BEST THING TO WATCH YOU GUYS. AND WHEN DEREK JETER WOULD COME BY ON DECK HE'D LOOK AT ME AND GIVE ME THE LITTLE, HOW YOU DOING? LITTLE TIP OF HIS CAP. YOU COME OUT, YOU LOOK AT LORNE, YOU GIVE TIPS OF YOUR CAP, THEN YOU FIND ME AND YOU START SWINGING THE BAT AS HARD AS YOU CAN, YOU GO -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND I GO, AND I'M WAVING AT YOU, AND I'M GOING HI. AND YOU'RE GOING -- YOU'RE NOT EVEN UP TO BAT YET. BUT I GOTTA SAY, THEN YOU GO UP TO BAT AND YOU HIT HOME RUNS EVERY TIME I'M THERE. AND I THINK I'M THE KEY TO YOUR GREAT SEASON THAT YOU JUST HAD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT YOU SHOULD THANK ME.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU'RE WELCOME.
WHEN I DO -- AND I DO REMEMBER LOOKIN' AT YOU. I'M TRYIN' TO FIGURE OUT YOUR LOYALTY. IT'S A LITTLE DIVIDED. ARE YOU A METS FAN? A YANKEES? RED SOX? JIMMY, WHICH ONE IS IT? [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: I'M A RANGER FAN, I'M A SEATTLE FAN, AND A YANKEE FAN. I'M A YANKEE FAN BUT I'M ROOTING FOR THE METS NOW BECAUSE -- 'CAUSE YOU'RE HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] HALF THE CITY IS SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THE METS. THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB. YOU HAD A -- YOU HAD A GREAT SEASON LAST SEASON THANKS TO ME, BUT YOU ALSO HIT A BIG MILESTONE WHEN YOU TURNED 40 YEARS OLD. AND YES, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
DEPRESSING.
Jimmy: NO IT'S NOT, IT'S A A GREAT THING. I WAS GONNA ASK YOU, IS THERE ANYTHING A 40-YEAR-OLD ALEX RODRIGUEZ WOULD SAY TO A A 20-YEAR-OLD A-ROD?
OH, BOY. DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME?
Jimmy: WHAT WOULD YOU --
I WOULD PROBABLY JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE. ENJOY YOURSELF AND REMEMBER TO HAVE FUN, AND, LET'S SEE, IF YOU EVER DO A PHOTO SHOOT, DON'T KISS ANY MIRRORS.
Jimmy: DON'T KISS ANY MIRRORS?
DO NOT KISS ANY MIRRORS.
Jimmy: I DON'T REMEMBER THE PHOTO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE KISSING A MIRROR. I DON'T REMEMBER THAT PHOTO AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
THEY JUST TALKED YOU INTO DOING IT AND YOU DID IT AND YOU GO, OH, MAN. WHY DID I DO THAT? I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE EVERYWHERE. WELL, AT LEAST WE DIDN'T MAKE FUN OF IT ON OUR SHOW WHEN WE DID "LATE NIGHT." THAT WAS THE ONE THING WE MADE SURE -- DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY ARM AND YOUR ARM. [ LAUGHTER ]
WE WERE YOUNG, JIMMY.
Jimmy: WE WERE YOUNG, ABSOLUTELY. I GOTTA SAY, YOU'RE FANTASTIC ON FOX ON THE WORLD SERIES. I LOVE YOU. HANDS DOWN, I KNOW YOU DON'T NEED ME TO SAY IT, BUT YOU'RE GREAT AT THIS JOB. DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO THIS?
NO, NO IDEA. AND THANK YOU. IT IS HARD TO DO.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET ALL YOUR THOUGHTS CONDENSED AND SAY IT IN 15 OR 20 SECONDS AND TRY TO, YOU KNOW, TALK TO YOUR FAN BASE ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THIS EVERY NIGHT.
Jimmy: OH, NO, NO, NO. PLEASE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I GOTTA SAY, YOU'RE UP THERE, JOE BUCK, I MEAN, LEGENDS, GUYS WHO HAVE DONE IT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YOU DON'T MISS A A STEP. I GO, I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS GONNA BE RISKY. WHY WOULD A-ROD DO THIS? I GO, YOU KNOW, THEN I CAN SEE YOU KIND OF LOOKING AT ME THROUGH THE CAMERA. YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] AS YOU'RE COMMENTATING, YOU'RE ALSO GIVING ME DIRTY LOOKS.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I FIGURED THE SAME THING, IT'S JUST LIKE BASEBALL, IT'S JUST LIKE THE YANKEES. YOU NEED A GREAT TEAM. WE HAVE FRANK, WE HAVE RAUL, WE HAVE OUR QUARTERBACK, KEVIN, WHO'S INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
HE'S LIKE MAGIC JOHNSON. HE JUST GIVES US NO-LOOK PASSES. MAKES US LOOK PRETTY GOOD.
Jimmy: FANTASTIC.
KEVIN'S THE KEY.
Jimmy: REALLY. DID YOU TRAIN, DID YOU GO TO THINGS, DID YOU COMMENT FROM HOME WITH THE VOLUME DOWN AND WATCH GAMES AND GO -- YOU KNOW ABOUT BASEBALL, WHICH IS REFRESHING TO WATCH, WHATEVER YOU SAY, I GO, "OH, THAT MAKES SENSE." IT'S A-ROD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
I LOVE TO WATCH BASEBALL, AND IF I DIDN'T TAKE THE JOB, I WOULD BE HOME WATCHING ALL THE PLAYOFFS GAME, WATCHING THE WORLD SERIES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND PROBABLY TALKIN' BACK TO THE TV.
Jimmy: YEAH. THE METS ARE DOWN NOW. THE METS ARE DOWN. AND THEY'RE COMIN' BACK HOME TO CITI FIELD. WHAT CAN THEY DO TO TURN THIS AROUND? BECAUSE THEY'RE DOWN TWO.
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS EVERYONE THINKS.
Jimmy: NO.
I BELIEVE IN THE METS. THE METS STILL HAVE A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING. LOOK, THE GREATEST THING ABOUT THIS WORLD SERIES IS THE BEST TWO TEAMS ARE PLAYING. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A VERY LONG SERIES, BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WE WENT INTO KANSAS CITY AND THEY BEAT US TWO OUT OF THREE. AND WE SAID, "WOW, THESE GUYS ARE REALLY, REALLY TOUGH," 'CAUSE THEY ARE. BUT THEN WE CAME BACK TO NEW YORK, JUST LIKE THE METS ARE, AND WE PLAYED THREE GAMES AND WE SWEPT THEM. ONE, TWO, THREE. SO THEY'RE BEATABLE. THEY'RE BEATABLE.
Jimmy: THEY ARE BEATABLE.
THE METS JUST HAVE TO PLAY REALLY GOOD BASEBALL. THEY HAVE TO PLAY GOOD DEFENSE. AND YOU NEVER KNOW.
Jimmy: THERE YA GO. YOU NEVER KNOW. [ APPLAUSE ] GOOD D, GOOD D. YOU WANTED TO DO ONE MORE THING BEFORE YOU LEFT. AND I THINK THIS IS KIND OF A A FUN THING. YOU WANT TO JUST SAY WHAT IT IS?
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU'RE WORKING, RIGHT?
I AM WORKING TOMORROW NIGHT, BUT I WANT TO SEE WHO IS THE BIGGEST YANKEE FAN -- I'M SORRY, I ALWAYS SAY YANKEE. SORRY, IT'S IN MY DNA. WHO'S THE BIGGEST MET FAN OUT THERE?
Jimmy: MET FAN?
METS, METS.
Jimmy: I THINK IT'S CLEAR IT'S THAT GUY WITH THE HUNTING -- THERE HE IS. ONLY GUY WEARING A METS HAT. YEAH.
