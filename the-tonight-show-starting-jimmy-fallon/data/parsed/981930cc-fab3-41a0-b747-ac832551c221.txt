THIS IS THE SHOW -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TO BE AT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU GUYS, IT'S HALLOWEEN! HAPPY HALLOWEEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ IT IS HALLOWEEN, WHICH MEANS YOU JUST SPENT THE NIGHT HANDING OUT CANDY, OR YOU'VE BEEN SITTING COMPLETELY STILL IN THE DARK, PRETENDING THAT YOU WEREN'T HOME. ONE OF THE TWO THINGS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOBODY MOVE! THEY CAN HEAR US! ACTUALLY, I SAW THAT THE NYPD WAS URGING STORES IN NEW YORK CITY NOT TO SELL EGGS OR SHAVING CREAM TO MINORS TO TRY TO PREVENT HALLOWEEN PRANKS. AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHICH STORES WERE ENFORCING THAT RULE, LOOK FOR THE ONES COVERED IN EGGS AND SHAVING CREAM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU LOSERS! AND GET THIS, I SAW A NEW STUDY THAT SAYS THAT EATING OVER 1500 PIECES OF CANDY CORN COULD ACTUALLY KILL YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM SINCE THE CURRENT RECORD FOR EATING A PIECE OF CANDY CORN IS TWO. [ APPLAUSE ] TASTES LIKE A -- TASTES LIKE A A CANDLE DIPPED IN SPLENDA. YEAH, NO THANKS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'LL TRY ONE MORE. YEAH, STILL NO. LET'S GET TO SOME ELECTION NEWS. AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD, THE FBI IS REVISITING ITS INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS BECAUSE SOME OF THEM WERE FOUND ON ANTHONY WEINER'S LAPTOP. REAL MESS, NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY E-MAILS, JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND ANYONE WILLING TO TOUCH ANTHONY WEINER'S LAPTOP. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YIKES! NOT TODAY. ♪♪
Steve: WEINER.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S STILL A LOT OF FIGHTING GOING ON BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND OTHER GOP LEADERS. IN FACT TRUMP ISN'T GOING TO HELP HOLD ANY MORE FUNDRAISERS THAT WOULD HELP SUPPORT OTHER REPUBLICAN RACES. WHEN ASKED WHY, TRUMP SAID, YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT OTHER RACES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY OH!
Jimmy: I READ THAT AS OF YESTERDAY, OVER 21 MILLION VOTES HAVE ALREADY BEEN CAST IN THE ELECTION. IT'S AMAZING TO SEE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WITH DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW ALL JOINING TOGETHER TO GET THIS ELECTION OVER WITH AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GET IT OVER WITH. THINK I MIGHT HAVE JUST PULLED SOMETHING ON THAT LAST JOKE. NOT SURE. NOT SURE IF I CAN GO ON, ACTUALLY.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. BOY, I TELL YOU -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, GUYS. HILLARY -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HILLARY CLINTON GOT QUITE A A SCARE TONIGHT. I GUESS A TRICK OR TREATER CAME TO THE DOOR DRESSED AS A LIE DETECTOR. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I TELL YOU THAT DONALD TRUMP, HE IS A SMART BUSINESSMAN. WHEN KIDS RANG HIS BELL AND YELLED TRICK OR TREAT, TRUMP YELLED TRICK, AND BEFORE THE KIDS COULD GRAB ANY CANDY, DECLARED BANKRUPTCY. BOOM, JUST LIKE THAT. [ APPLAUSE ] WELL, HERE'S AN INTERESTING HALLOWEEN STORY YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IN THE PAPERS TODAY. RESEARCHERS SAY THE SMELL OF PUMPKINS CAN ACTUALLY CAUSE SEXUAL AROUSAL IN MEN. GUYS, A WORD OF WARNING, BEFORE YOU ACT ON IMPULSE, BLOW OUT THE CANDLE FIRST. OKAY? BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE -- IT'S GOING TO BE VERY -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HAD A GREAT COSTUME THIS YEAR. EARLIER TONIGHT, I PUT A A DOUCHEBAG ON MY HEAD WENT OUT AS BILLY BUSH. YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AS YOU KNOW, BILLY BUSH GOT FIRED FOR THE OUTRAGEOUS THINGS HE AND DONALD TRUMP SAID ABOUT WOMEN. SEE, I THINK TRUMP SHOULD HIRE BILLY. THIS WAY, HE COULD GRAB BUSH WHENEVER HE WANTED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SEE, THE GREATEST THING ABOUT OUR COUNTRY, AND THIS IS WHY I'M OPTIMISTIC. OUT OF THE MORE THAN 325 MILLION AMERICANS, WE WERE ABLE TO NARROW IT DOWN TO THE TWO BEST-LOVED, MOST QUALIFIED PEOPLE. THAT'S -- I MEAN, THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT IS A TESTAMENT TO US. YOU KNOW, I WATCH BOTH POLITICAL CONVENTIONS THIS SUMMER, AND HERE'S SOMETHING I DON'T UNDERSTAND. LIKE AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, RUDY GIULIANI SPOKE. HE'S GOT THREE WIVES. NEWT GINGRICH SPOKE. HE'S GOT THREE WIVES. THEN DONALD TRUMP SPOKE. HE'S GOT THREE WIVES. THE ONLY ONE WITH ONE WIFE IS MITT ROMNEY AND HE'S A MORMON. IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. AND DID YOU SEE BILL CLINTON AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION WHERE HE INTRODUCED HIS NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, I'M WITH HER AND HER AND HER -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND THESE TWO DOLLS. AND AS YOU KNOW, THE STATE OF NEW YORK IS SUING TRUMP UNIVERSITY FOR $40 MILLION, CLAIMING IT WAS NOT A REAL COLLEGE BECAUSE THE STUDENTS DID NOT GET A GOOD EDUCATION AND COULD NOT FIND JOBS AFTER THEY GRADUATED. I KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE A REAL COLLEGE TO ME. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND SPEAKING -- SPEAKING OF EDUCATION, HILLARY CLINTON WAS CAMPAIGNING LAST WEEK AND STOPPED AT A SCHOOL WHERE CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 5 WERE LEARNING TO WORK WITH COMPUTERS. I THOUGHT THIS WAS NICE. THE FORMER FIRST LADY ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME TO SHOW THE YOUNG PEOPLE HOW TO USE THAT ALL IMPORTANT DELETE FILES BUTTON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS AT A A BIG FUND-RAISING DINNER IN BEVERLY HILLS LAST WEEK WHERE PEOPLE PAID $100,000 A PLATE TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY. THAT WAS REALLY -- [ APPLAUSE ] AND AS YOU KNOW, THESE HILLARY E-MAIL SCANDALS BROUGHT ANTHONY WEINER BACK INTO THE NEWS. YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE SEXTING SCANDAL THING. HERE'S A QUESTION NOBODY IS ASKING. ANTHONY WEINER IS JEWISH, RIGHT? RIGHT? SO, THIS -- THIS SCANDAL MAKE HIM A HEBREW NATIONAL WEINER? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? I MEAN, THESE ARE THINGS -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ECONOMY. HERE'S HOW BAD THE ECONOMY IS. TWO MILWAUKEE MEN WERE ARRESTED THIS WEEK FOR TRYING TO JOIN ISIS. DID YOU HEAR THEIR EXCUSE? THEY SAID, HEY, NOBODY ELSE IS HIRING. THAT'S HOW BAD THE ECONOMY IS. THE ECONOMY IS SO BAD, FORD'S COME OUT WITH ITS ANNUAL LIST OF THE 400 RICHEST AMERICANS AND 200 OF THEM HAVE MOVED BACK IN WITH THEIR PARENTS. THAT'S HOW BAD THE ECONOMY IS. [ APPLAUSE ] JIMMY, THE ECONOMY IS SO BAD, IN BEVERLY HILLS, I SAW A WOMAN TANNING USING THE SUN. THAT NEVER HAPPENS. THE ECONOMY IS SO BAD THAT THE TODAY SHOW, KATHIE LEE AND HODA WERE SPLITTING A 40. I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT. I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. THE ECONOMY IS SO BAD IN L.A., WOMEN ARE MARRYING GUYS FOR LOVE. THAT'S HOW BAD IT'S GOTTEN. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S HOW BAD IT'S GOTTEN.

Jimmy: IT REALLY IS. AND HOW ABOUT ALL THE EXCITEMENT WITH THE CUBS NOW?
IT'S AN EVEN WHITE SOX FAN, LIKE, DIE HARD WHITE SOX FAN. IT'S LIKE GO CUBBIES, LIKE IT'S GETS A BIG -- IT'S A BIG DEAL RIGHT NOW IN CHICAGO.
Jimmy: OH, THEY LOVE THE SPORTS, YEAH. HAVE YOU BEEN TO WRIGLEY?
I HAVE. I HAVE. WE WENT DURING THE LAST PLAYOFF SERIES AGAINST THE DODGERS.
Jimmy: IT'S AMAZING, RIGHT?
YEAH AND THE BEST PART IS THE DESSERT CART IS EVERYTHING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
IT IS EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: THE DESSERT CART?
YES, IT COMES AROUND LIKE FIFTH INNING AND I'M LIKE, HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
REALLY?
THEY HAVE THIS THING CALLED A RAINBOW CAKE THAT'S SO GOOD.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. I'VE NEVER BEEN. I'M DYING -- I'D LOVE TO GO. I'M DYING TO GO. IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE ROOTING FOR SPORTS IN CHICAGO. I ALSO LOVE CHRISTMAS MOVIES, HOLIDAY MOVIES, "ALMOST CHRISTMAS," JB SMOOVE BEING SO FUNNY IN IT. OH MY GOSH!
JB, MO'NIQUE.
Jimmy: MO'NIQUE IS GREAT AS WELL.
JOHN MICHAEL HIGGINS, IGGINS. DC YOUNG FLY, IT'S SO MANY FUNNY PEOPLE.
Jimmy: AND YOU WANT TO SET UP THE MOVIE AT ALL AND TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT IT'S ABOUT?
THIS CLIP IS -- IT'S THE FIRST CHRISTMAS BACK WITH OUR WHOLE FAMILY AFTER THE MATRIARCH HAS PASSED AWAY AND THERE'S A LOT OF SHENANIGANS GOING ON AND PERHAPS I HAVE INVITED MY SISTER'S HUSBAND'S MISTRESS TO DINNER. AS YOU DO. AS YOU DO.
Jimmy: YOU GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.
Jay: IT'S CHRISTMAS.
Jimmy: AFTER ALL, IT IS CHRISTMAS.
Jay: TIME TO FORGIVE.
Jimmy: YEAH. ALSO IN THE MOVIE, THEY'RE TRYING TO RECREATE THIS SWEET POTATO PIE RECIPE THAT THEY CAN'T, THEY CAN'T REPLICATE. I NEVER HAD A SIGNATURE DISH. I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO COOK.
WE DO CANDIED HAM IN OUR HOUSE. WE'RE FROM NEBRASKA. MEAT IS A BIG, IS A BIG PART OF OUR DIET. BUT YEAH, THE ART OF THE CANDIED HAM, IS LIKE A TIME HONORED TRADITION.
Jimmy: OH REALLY? WHAT'S THE SECRET?
I DEVELOPED MY OWN. IT'S WITH, I USE COCA-COLA, BROWN SUGAR, AND PINEAPPLE JUICE. AS A GLAZE. IT'S SUPER HEALTHY.
Jimmy: IT'S HEALTHY, YEAH.
