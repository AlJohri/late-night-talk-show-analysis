YEAH.
Jimmy: WE ASKED YOU, BECAUSE WE WANTED TO DO A BIT AND WE THOUGHT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS. ACTUALLY, DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS?
WELL, MY IDEA WAS MUCH SIMPLER. I THOUGHT MAYBE I WOULD JUST BE TEACHING -- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO DO SOMETHING FROM "FOOTLOOSE." BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE I WOULD BE TEACHING YOU HOW TO DANCE A LA "LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE BOY." I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WOULD -- AND THEN WHEN I GOT THE PITCH BACK FROM YOU GUYS, IT WAS LIKE ANGRY WAREHOUSE DANCE. AND I THOUGHT, OH, NO. I CAN'T DO THE ANGRY WAREHOUSE DANCE. IT'S JUST TOO MUCH. AND IT WAS SO ELABORATE. BUT YOUR TEAM WAS SO GREAT THAT I JUST KIND OF PLUGGED RIGHT INTO IT. I MEAN, EVERYTHING WAS KIND OF DONE FOR ME.
Jimmy: YOU WERE HERE ALL DAY SHOOTING. IT WAS A WHOLE, FULL DAY SHOOT.
WELL, THE CRAZY THING WAS I WAS WORKING ON "THE FOLLOWING", AND I WRAPPED THE NIGHT BEFORE AT ABOUT, LITERALLY, LIKE 2:00 IN THE MORNING. AND I'M STANDING IN MY KITCHEN. AND I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER SOME OF THESE MOVES. AND I'D SEEN THE THING THAT YOU HAD PUT TOGETHER, AND I HAD TO GO AND RENT "FOOTLOOSE" ON NETFLIX, LITERALLY.

Jimmy: IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. THAT'S YOU IN OUR STUDIO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
MEANWHILE, THE THING IS --
Jimmy: I MEAN, IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS IS THE THING, THOUGH, IS THAT YOU WORK SO HARD IN THE COURSE OF YOUR LIFE. AND YOU DO WORK THAT YOU HOPE IS GOING TO AFFECT PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, MOVING ROLES, AND COMPLEX, YOU KNOW, DRAMAS AND ALL THAT STUFF. AND PEOPLE COME UP TO ME IN AN AIRPORT RIGHT NOW AND THEY SAY, "I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THE MOST MOVING THING YOU'VE EVER DONE, THE THING THAT TOUCHED ME MOST WAS YOUR APPEARANCE ON 'JIMMY FALLON'." [ LAUGHTER ] OH, REALLY? OKAY.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S IT! THAT'S ALL YOU NEEDED, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS MOVING. IT WAS GREAT. AND THEN, YOU CALLED US BACK BECAUSE YOU WERE GOING TO AN '80s THEMED PARTY.
I KNOW. WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS THERE WAS A FRIEND OF MINE WAS HAVING AN '80s THEMED PARTY. AND I SAID, "OKAY, WELL, I CAN'T REALLY GO TO AN '80s THEMED PARTY AND NOT BE ME." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I KNOW.
BUT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, I MEAN, I COULD BE JUDD NELSON OR I COULD BE MADONNA. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO, I NEEDED THE JACKET. AND I WAS TRYING TO TAKE -- I ACTUALLY ASKED OUR COSTUMER ON THE FOLLOWING", WHERE CAN I GET THAT RED TUXEDO JACKET? AND SHE SAID, "WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST CALL UP FALLON?" YOU GUYS WERE NICE ENOUGH TO LEND IT TO ME.
Jimmy: AND YOU TWEETED IT OUT AND THERE'S THE JACKET. AND WE WE'RE SO HAPPY YOU WORE IT AGAIN. IT WAS SO FUN.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND DID IT --
I SPILLED A LITTLE CRAP ON THE SLEEVE THERE. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT'S YOUR JACKET, MAN.
IT'S FUNNY THOUGH, BECAUSE I WALKED INTO THE PARTY AND EVERYONE'S LIKE REALLY ELABORATE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS THIS THEME PARTY AND THEY'RE ALL DONE UP TO THE NINES. AND SOME GUY GOES, "DUDE, TOO EASY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU CAN'T DO YOU FROM "FOOTLOOSE." NOW, COME ON, IT'S NOT FAIR.
TOO EASY, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO DO THAT. I MEAN, IT'S LIKE INVITING JON CRYER TO AN '80s PARTY AND HE'S NOT GOING TO BE DUCKY. YOU GOT TO BE DUCKY, MAN!
THERE WERE A LOT OF DUCKIES THERE, BY THE WAY.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GREAT COSTUME, DUCKY.
I DON'T KNOW IF JON HIMSELF WAS THERE, BUT THERE WERE DEFINITELY DUCKIES. WALL-TO-WALL DUCKIES.
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T GET ANY PHOTOS FROM THE PARTY THOUGH?
NO. I DIDN'T, ACTUALLY. THIS IS KIND OF A COOL PARTY BECAUSE ON THE INVITATION IT SAYS, "PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANY PHOTOS OR TWEET ANYTHING."
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
SO, YOU CAN IMAGINE --
Jimmy: OH, I GUESS SO. YEAH, SO YEAH, YEAH. IT'S ONE OF THOSE COOL PARTIES.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE COOL PARTIES.
Jimmy: I NEVER GET INVITED TO THOSE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DID GET A QUICK SHOUT OUT IN "GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY."

Jimmy: I LOVE THAT. HE WAS LIKE, "DUDE, KEVIN BACON'S THE HERO OF OUR TIME."
WELL, I LOVE THAT MOVIE. I ACTUALLY ADORED THAT MOVIE, WHETHER HE SHOUTED OUT TO ME OR NOT. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS SO FUNNY AND SO COOL. AND I'D DONE A MOVIE WITH THE DIRECTOR RIGHT BEFORE, JAMES GUNN. HE DID A LITTLE TINY MOVIE I WAS IN CALLED "SUPER." AND THE DEAL WITH THAT MOVIE WAS THAT I GOT A CALL FROM MY AGENT, AND MY AGENT SAID, "WELL, JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME WAS SET FOR THIS PART BUT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT." I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS LIKE A A SCHEDULING THING OR WHATEVER. AND I WAS LIKE, I'M DOING IT. I MEAN, WHEN AM I EVER GOING TO GET JCVD'S SLOPPY SECONDS? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I WAS LIKE, "I AM IN."
Jimmy: ARE YOU GUYS UP FOR THE SAME ROLES?
NOT THAT OFTEN.
Jimmy: I WOULD TAKE IT TOO. THAT'S AWESOME, MAN.
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I WAS LIKE SIGHT UNSEEN. I JUST SHOWED UP.
Jimmy: I ALWAYS TOLD EVERYONE, YOU'RE THE NEXT JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME. THAT'S PRETTY RAD. AND THEN HE WENT ON TO DO "GUARDIANS."
THEN HE WENT ON TO DO "GUARDIANS." YEAH, DIDN'T PUT ME IN THAT ONE, BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. HE PUT YOUR NAME IN. THAT WAS A HOME RUN.
HE PUT MY NAME IN, YEAH.
Jimmy: WELL, I MEAN, "THE FOLLOWING", CONGRATS ON THAT.

I'D LOVE TO.
Jimmy: DO YOU LIKE GAMES? ARE YOU COOL?
YOU KNOW, I LIKE GAMES. I KIND OF LIKE PLAYING THIS GAME -- THEY DON'T NEED ANY PROMOTIONAL HELP FROM ME. BUT THERE ARE ANGRY BIRDS INVOLVED.
Jimmy: IS THAT YOUR GAME?
MY WIFE HATES THAT I PLAY IT. AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY.
Jimmy: BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO ANYONE ELSE.
I THINK SHE THOUGHT MAYBE WHEN SHE WAS MARRYING ME THAT I WAS MORE OF LIKE THE BOOKISH TYPE. LIKE, SHE THOUGHT MAYBE I WOULD BE READING TOLSTOY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO I KIND OF HAVE TO HIDE IT. I HAVE THE SOUND OFF AND I HIDE IT ALMOST LIKE PORN, YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I FOUND THIS NEW THING, WHICH IS AN APP WHERE YOU CAN LEARN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE. SO, I'VE STARTED DOING THAT BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST LIKE A A GAME. YOU KNOW, IF YOU GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL, IT'S LIKE "BA, BA!" OR, "RA, RA, RA, RA." YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT.
Jimmy: SO YOU SPEAK TO IT?
WELL, YOU SPEAK TO IT, YEAH. BECAUSE IT WANTS TO HEAR HOW YOU'RE DOING. SO, I WAS DOING IT THE OTHER DAY IN THE MAKEUP CHAIR.

Jimmy: HE SLEEPS IN THE CRIB.
BUT WHEN I'M SITTING THERE, THE MAKEUP ARTIST SAYS TO ME, "WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT?" THAT'S SPANISH. SHE SAID, "NO, WHY ARE YOU USING THIS VOICE?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND I REALIZED THAT, WHEN I PLAY THIS GAME, YOU KNOW, SUDDENLY I'M ANTONIO BANDERAS. AND I JUST CAN'T HELP IT. AND SO THE GOOD NEWS IS, FOR KYRA, IS THAT I'M NOT PLAYING AS MUCH ANGRY BIRDS, WHICH SHE'S HAPPY ABOUT. AND SHE'S NOW SLEEPING WITH ANTONIO BANDERAS. [ APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: YEAH.
IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME ANYMORE. TAKE IT.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU DO. YOU DON'T STEAL STUFF AND THEN SAY IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME ANYMORE.
I HAD IT, WHAT, SIX MONTHS. AND NOW I'M RETURNING IT. BUT THANK YOU. IT'S WOULD BE A NICE NECKLACE, RIGHT? BELT BUCKLE?
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'D BE A GOOD BELT BUCKLE. LAST TIME YOU SAID I'M GOING TO TAKE SOMETHING BUT I'LL RETURN IT. YOU'RE NOT STEALING IT.
OKAY, THERE YOU GO. I TOOK SOMETHING. I'M RETURNING IT. HOW YOU DOING?
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. I'M FANTASTIC.
I LOVE THE MUSIC. SO LOW-KEY, I LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, THEY KEPT IT LOW-KEY. CAN I JUST ASK YOU --
I LIKE THE RHYTHMS. IT GOES WITH MY HAIR. YES? [ LAUGHTER ]

OKAY, LISTEN, JIMMY. THE THEME IN MY BEDROOM IS "HAUNTED DOLLHOUSE," AND I WANTED TO INVEST IN SOMETHING -- A WIG TO HANG ON THE WALL. I'M A BIG WIG PERSON. LACE FRONT. SO CRYSTAL SHONUS, WHO MAKES THE WIGS FOR "SNL," SHE TEACHES WIG MAKING AT NORTH CAROLINA SCHOOL OF THE ARTS. SO, I WENT THERE. SHE MADE ME THIS WIG. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME DECIDE -- FIND THE CHARACTER FOR THE WIG. I'M OBSESSED WITH IT. IT COSTS AS MUCH AS IF YOU HAD DENTAL SURGERY. LIKE IF YOU GOT A CROWN. IF YOU LIVED IN ALABAMA. MAYBE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT WAS A BIG INVESTMENT. AND IT'S EASY TO GO HIPPIE OR BE LIKE, "I HAD MY TUBES TIED" OR "I'M GOING TO BUY A HORSE." IT'S TOO EASY TO DO THAT.
Jimmy: IT'S TOO EASY, YEAH.
SO I WANT TO TRY TO COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT CHARACTER.

Jimmy: OH, NO, I PUT A WIG ON YOU ALMOST CAN'T EVEN TELL THAT I'M WEARING ONE.
ARE YOU WEARING ONE NOW? NO, I CAN'T TOUCH, RIGHT?
Jimmy: YOU CAN TOUCH, YEAH. IT'S NOT REAL.
