Jimmy: I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
EVER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SO FAR, SO GOOD.
YEAH, WE'LL SEE. I'M NOT SHOWING ANYTHING, RIGHT?
Jimmy: YOU'RE DOING GREAT. NO, YOU'RE FANTASTIC. YOU LOOK GORGEOUS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: IT'S SURREAL FOR ME TO SEE THIS ALL HAPPEN. BECAUSE I MET YOU WHEN YOU WERE PROBABLY 6 OR 7 YEARS OLD. DO YOU REMEMBER ME AT ALL?
I DO REMEMBER YOU SLIGHTLY, HANGING IN SOME CORNER BEING SHADY. I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, I WAS NOT LURKING. I WASN'T SHADY. NO, NO, I WAS AT LIKE A PARTY THAT YOUR DAD WAS THERE AND SO HE BROUGHT YOU. IT WAS ALL KIDS PLAYING AROUND. IT WAS AN ADULT PARTY, REALLY. AND KIDS WERE ALL PLAYING. BUT YOU HAD LIKE NO TEETH. SO, THEY WERE ALL COMING IN. AND YOU WERE SUPER CUTE, LITTLE BILLIE LOURD. AND YOUR DAD GOES, I WAS GONNA PLAY GUITAR. PEOPLE WERE JUST GETTING UP AND SINGING. AND BILLY JOEL WAS SINGING. AND IT WAS CRAZY. AND THEN I WAS GONNA PLAY SOME SONG. I WAS GONNA GET MY GUITAR AND YOUR DAD GOES, "BILLIE, WHY DON'T YOU GET UP AND PLAY THE PIANO?"
AND I WAS LIKE, WOLF. I DON'T WANNA DO THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I WAS NOT INTO IT. WAS NOT INTO IT.
Jimmy: NO, YOU GO, NO. DAD, I DON'T WANNA DO IT.
EW.
Jimmy: LEAVE ME ALONE, DAD. COME ON. JUST GO UP AND PLAY. PLAY SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY. AND YOU GO, "DAD, I DON'T WANNA DO IT." AND YOU'RE SO LITTLE. LIKE, WHAT'S SHE GONNA PLAY ON THE PIANO, SHE'S 6 YEARS OLD, YOU KNOW?
MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB.
Jimmy: MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB, YEAH. SO THEN, FINALLY, HE GOES, "I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE BUCKS."
I'LL DO IT FOR THE MONEY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, SO YOU DID IT FOR THE MONEY. WENT ON THE PIANO AND JUST PLAYED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CONCERTO OR SOMETHING AND I WAS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND I PUT MY GUITAR DOWN. I'M LIKE, OKAY, I'LL BE OVER AT THE BAR HANGING OUT, BUT THAT GIRL IS AMAZING. I WAS LIKE, SHE IS GOING TO BE JUST HUGE SOME DAY. AND HERE YOU ARE ON "SCREAM QUEENS" AND YOU'RE JUST HITTING IT OUT OF THE PARK. I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU, PAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, GUYS.
Jimmy: NOW, FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU, YOUR DAD IS JUST ONE OF THE CLASSIEST, SMARTEST GUYS IN OUR INDUSTRY. I LOVE THE GUY SO MUCH. YOUR MOM IS CARRIE FISHER. PRINCESS LEIA, YEAH, HELLO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WAS THAT A BIG DEAL WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP, PRINCESS LEIA? YOU KNEW YOUR MOM WAS IN "STAR WARS"?
I MEAN, HONESTLY GROWING UP, I WASN'T REALLY THAT INTO IT. MY MOM TRIED TO PLAY IT FOR ME. AND I SAT DOWN AND SHE PUT IT ON. AND HONESTLY, MY FIRST REACTION WAS, THIS IS TOO LOUD. AND SO, I RAN OUT --
Jimmy: AS A KID?
YEAH, AS A KID. I WAS LIKE 6 YEARS OLD. SHE WAS LIKE, PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. I'M IN IT. IT'S REALLY COOL. THERE'S LIKE A LOT OF ACTION. YOU'LL LIKE THINK I'M A COOL MOM NOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I SAT DOWN, SHE PUT IT ON. AND I WAS LIKE, I REALLY DON'T -- I DON'T GET IT. IT'S LOUD, THERE'S LIKE A BUNCH OF GUNS. PEOPLE RUNNING. NOT A FAN.
Jimmy: NO, NOT A FAN.
AND THEN A FEW YEARS LATER, I STARTED LIKE GETTING RESPECT FOR IT AND STARTED LIKING IT. BUT WHEN I WENT TO MIDDLE SCHOOL, IT GOT KIND OF AWKWARD. BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALIZE SHE WAS A SEX ICON UNTIL I GOT TO MIDDLE SCHOOL. AND THEN THE BOYS STARTED COMING UP TO ME AND SAYING, I THINK YOUR MOM IS THE HOTTEST WOMAN EVER. AND AT FIRST I WENT IN THE CORNER AND CRIED ABOUT IT AND WAS REALLY HURT AND THEN I CAME BACK AT THEM AND THEY SAID IT TO ME THE NEXT DAY. THEY WERE LIKE, I THINK YOUR MOM IS REALLY HOT. AND I WAS LIKE, ME TOO. ME TOO. AND THEN THEY THOUGHT I WAS AS CREEPY AS THEY WERE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, IT WORKED OUT.
Jimmy: A WAY TO COME BACK.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: AND HERE YOU ARE IN "SCREAM QUEENS." THIS IS GREAT. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW, IT'S FUNNY, IT'S CAMPY. THERE'S A MURDER. THEY'RE ALL CHANELS.
ALL THE CHANELS. IT'S LIKE HEATHERS, THAT MOVIE. WE LIKE TO CALL IT HYS-TERRIFYING. A GOOD MIX OF HYSTERICAL AND TERRIFYING.
Jimmy: A GOOD NEW WORD.
MOSTLY HYSTERICAL.
Jimmy: YEAH. WHAT CHANEL ARE YOU?
I AM CHANEL NUMBER THREE.
Jimmy: YES, EXACTLY. CHANEL NUMBER THREE. AND SO THERE'S A MURDERER GOING AROUND. WE DON'T KNOW, IT COULD BE --
IT COULD BE ME. COULD BE ANYBODY.
Jimmy: BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW. YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
WELL, I MIGHT KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING NOW, BUT LIKE EVERY JOB I'VE HAD, THE CIA MIGHT TAKE ME AWAY IF I TELL YOU ANYTHING.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY, BUT WE WILL FIND OUT THIS SEASON WHO THE KILLER IS?
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: WELL, SINCE YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT ANY OF THAT STUFF, CAN YOU SING A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY? 'CAUSE YOU HAVE A GREAT VOICE. COME ON.
AH, ERYKAH BADU IS HERE. I CAN'T TOP THAT.
I CAN'T!
Jimmy: BILLIE! BILLIE, I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE BUCKS. [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, FINE. WHAT AM I SINGING?
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. WHAT SHOULD YOU SING?

HAS CHANGED. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU. THERE'S A LOT OF WHITE PEOPLE WALKING AROUND, ISN'T THERE? BUT HE DIDN'T. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE WAS A A WHITE GUY, AND THAT'S A BLACK VOICE. SO HE KNEW THE RULES. I'M MIXED, ACTUALLY, WHICH IS SOMETHING I'M REAL SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT. OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE I LOOK SO MUCH LIKE THE ENEMY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MY MOM IS A RED HEAD, AND MY DAD IS A BLACK GUY. BUT I'M MORE HALF IRISH, HALF TIGER WOODS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO WHEN PEOPLE ASK WHAT AM I, THE ANSWER IS UPSET. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING AFTER ME OVER MY BACKGROUND. I'M VERY ACCUSTOMED TO THAT. AFTER A SHOW, THIS LADY CAME UP TO ME AND WORD FOR WORD, SAID, "IF YOU'RE BLACK, WHERE'S YOUR BLACK CARD?" SO NATURALLY, I SMILED BACK. CAUSE THAT'S AN AGGRESSIVE ASS QUESTION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SHE SAID IT AGAIN. SHE WAS LIKE, "IF YOU'RE BLACK, WHERE IS YOUR BLACK CARD?" I WAS LIKE, MA'AM, I'M 30 YEARS OLD. OKAY, I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE CARRYING AROUND A CARD THAT PROVES THEY'RE BLACK. YOU KNOW, AND SHE SNAPPED BACK, "YOU DON'T LOOK 30, EITHER." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO I WAS LIKE, ALL RIGHT, THEN. THAT'S MY BLACK CARD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ABSOLUTELY. WHAT CAN I SAY? WE AGE WELL. YOU KNOW? [ CHEERS ] WE, WE, WE. I PLAYED BASKETBALL THROUGHOUT HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. AND UNFORTUNATELY, I WATCHED MOSTLY, THROUGHOUT HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. BUT GROWING UP, I WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE LIGHTER DUDES ON MY TEAM. AND MY FRIENDS USED TO ALWAYS MESS WITH ME. THEY WOULD BE LIKE, "HEY, RANDY, YOU KNOW WHO YOU LOOK LIKE? YOU KNOW THAT DUDE, BENNY FROM 'THE SANDLOT?' [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DON'T HE LOOK LIKE HIM? SAY RAND, YOU KNOW WHO ELSE YOU LOOK LIKE? THAT DUDE YEAH-YEAH FROM 'THE SANDLOT.' MATTER OF FACT, RAND, WE THINK YOU LOOK LIKE EVERY DUDE BUT THE BLACK KID. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FROM 'THE SANDLOT.'" OH, THANK YOU. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A A CO-SIGNER LIKE, OH YEAH THAT'S TRUE. YOU DO BE LOOKING LIKE A LOT OF DUDES, THOUGH, FOR REAL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DON'T WANT TO ALIENATE MYSELF, BUT I LIKE LeBRON JAMES, AND HEAR ME OUT. I LIKE LeBRON. ABSOLUTELY. GIVE IT TO HIM. [ APPLAUSE ] I LOVE LeBRON. I LIKE LeBRON BECAUSE I RELATE TO LeBRON. SEE, I FEEL LIKE WE CAN AGREE, THE WORLD USED TO TUNE IN TO WATCH JORDAN SUCCEED. BUT NOW, I FEEL LIKE THE WORLD TUNES IN JUST TO WATCH LeBRON FAIL. AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT MY FRIENDS HAVE WATCHED ME TRY AND GET GIRLS WITH THOSE SAME HATING EYES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'LL PAINT YOU A PICTURE. WE'LL BE IN THE SPOT. CLOCK'S TICKING DOWN. I GOT THE ROCK. TIME TO MAKE A MOVE. BUT HE SEEMS TO BE FALTERING DOWN THE STRETCH. LeBRON LOOKING QUITE PASSIVE HERE IN THIS FOURTH QUARTER. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, LAST CALL HAS BEEN SOUNDED. LIGHTS ARE COMING ON. UBER APPS OPENING. LOOKS LIKE THIS ONE'S GOING TO SLIP AWAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I SOUND LIKE LeBRON GIVING A A PRESS CONFERENCE TO MY FRIENDS IN THE CAR AFTERWARDS. JUST LIKE, WELL, YOU KNOW, I TRY TO GO OUT THERE AND GET Y'ALL INVOLVED EARLY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ON THE PREGAME FORGET ABOUT THAT 30 I HAD ON THAT KEYSTONE LIGHT. THAT JOINT WASN'T CHEAP. BUT YOU KNOW, I PROBABLY JUST THINK ABOUT THIS JOINT TONIGHT AND HAVE FOLLOW- UP SEX TOMORROW. AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT FRIEND GOING AT YOU BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T CLOSE, SOUNDING LIKE STEPHEN A. SMITH IN YOUR EAR. JUST LIKE, WELL FIRST AND FOREMOST, LET ME JUST START BY SAYING, THIS IS THE FOURTH STRAIGHT FRIDAY NIGHT WE ENDED UP AT McDONALD'S, LeBRON. IT WAS TWO CHEESEBURGERS LAST WEEK. TWO CHEESEBURGERS THIS WEEK. AND QUITE FRANKLY, I CAN'T HANDLE ANY MORE VALUE MEALS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OH, THANK YOU. YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT FRIEND INTERJECTING ON YOUR BEHALF. YOU KNOW, DEFENDING YOU LIKE CHRIS BROUSSARD. WELL, ACTUALLY, I HAD SPOKEN TO LeBRON, WHO TOLD ME INITIALLY HE WAS GOING TO TRY TO WORK HER WITH THAT TEXT GAME, AS HE SAID, BUT ONCE HE GOT TO THAT JOINT, HE DIDN'T HAVE SERVICE, YOU KNOW.
