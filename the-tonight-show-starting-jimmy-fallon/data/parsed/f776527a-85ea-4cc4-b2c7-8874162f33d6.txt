YOU'VE GOT TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL." I SAID, "BUT THE DOCTOR MIGHT BE JEWISH AND HE WOULD BE REALLY --" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE WON'T GET IT. HE WON'T GET IT. OH MY GOSH.
THAT'S WHY I HAVE A HALF A A SHOW.
Jimmy: IT'S AMAZING HERE. THERE'S A PIECE ABOUT HERE YOU. LOOK AT THIS PHOTO OF YOU.
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS. THERE'S A GREAT PHOTO.
I LOVE THAT PICTURE. YEAH.
Jimmy: ANNIE?
ANNIE LEIBOVITZ.
Jimmy: ANNIE LEIBOVITZ. YOU CAN'T BEAT HER. AND THE ARTICLE IS BY -- LIZA MINNELLI.
BY LIZA. I KNOW! YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S AN HONOR, HUH?
HIGH -- HIGH SCORING, YEAH.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH. I KNOW. SO SWEET OF HER.
Jimmy: THAT WAS SUPER NICE. HAVE YOU MET LIZA?
OH, I MET HER A LOT.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE?
YEAH. I MET HER -- LIKE, I MET HER WHEN SHE CAME TO "CABARET" THE FIRST TIME. BUT, MOST RECENTLY, LAST YEAR, WE'VE DONE SOME SHOWS TOGETHER. WE DID SOME GIGS.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS CALLED "LIZA AND ALAN." FIRST IT WAS CALLED "LIZA AND ALAN: ONE NIGHT ONLY." WE DID TWO NIGHTS.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S GOOD.
AND IT WAS CALLED "LIZA AND ALAN AT TOWN HALL." AND THEY'RE DOING A RECORD OF IT ACTUALLY. THE RECORD IS COMING OUT -- IN THE SUMMER. AND -- BUT THERE WAS A BIG SIGN -- WITH LIGHTS THAT SAID "LIZA AND ALAN." AND I CAME TO THE SOUND CHECK, I WAS LIKE, "I AM HAVING THAT." SO I, I GOT IT.
Jimmy: YOU DO?
I MANAGED TO BLUDGEON THE PRODUCER AND -- AT MY HOUSE IN THE CAT SKILLS. WE CALL IT THE "LIZA AND ALAN LINE." IT'S ENORMOUS. ACTUALLY TOO BRIGHT LIKE BEING IN A SUN BED.
Jimmy: IN YOUR HOUSE?
IN MY HOUSE. UPSTATE, YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO FUN.
IT SAYS "LIZA AND ALAN."
Jimmy: THEY GAVE YOU THE SIGN? "LIZA AND ALAN."
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TOO OFTEN.
Jimmy: IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AT ALL. ABSOLUTELY NOT. I FOLLOW YOU ON TWITTER. AND YOU'RE GREAT TO FOLLOW. VERY FUN THINGS. AND BUT THEN YOU GOT INTO, KIND OF A BEEF -- WITH THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."
OOH. YEAH. WELL --
Jimmy: SERIOUS STUFF.
THIS IS A HUGE JOURNALISTIC FAUX PAS.
Jimmy: YES.
AND SO, THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" COME AND TOOK PHOTOS OF ME GETTING READY FOR THE SHOW AND AND EVERYTHING. AND -- BLAH BLAH BLAH. AND TALK TO ME AND TALK TO MY DRESSER, KIMBERLY, AND ALL THAT. ANYWAY, SO WHEN THE ARTICLE CAME OUT, IT HAD, YOU KNOW, VARIOUS PICTURES OF ME GETTING READY. THEY SAID, "AND BLAH BLAH BLAH. MR. CUMMING WEARS A COD PIECE IN THE SHOW AND BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH." AND I WAS LIKE, "I -- I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WEAR A COD PIECE IN THE SHOW." AND I TWEETED A PICTURE OF MY CROTCH FROM THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS A HARNESS THING. AND I WENT, "IT'S ALL ME ALL THE TIME." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO, THEN -- THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" PRINTED A RETRACTION, AN APOLOGY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LOOK AT THAT. AN EARLIER VERSION INCORRECTLY SAID THAT MR. CUMMING WAS WEARING COD PIECE AS PART OF HIS COSTUME.
AND I SAID, "THIS IS THE PROOF OF THE POWER OF TWITTER AND THE CONSTANT FIGHT WE ALL HAVE FOR TRUTH AND DEMOCRACY."
Jimmy: YEAH EXACTLY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STAND UP FOR ONE SELF!
YEAH. STAND UP.
Jimmy: THIS IS ALL YOU ALL THE TIME. WE'RE SO PSYCHED ABOUT IT. IT CAN'T -- IT CAN'T BE HAPPEN TO A BETTER GUY. YOU'RE THE BEST.
AW, THANK YOU.
