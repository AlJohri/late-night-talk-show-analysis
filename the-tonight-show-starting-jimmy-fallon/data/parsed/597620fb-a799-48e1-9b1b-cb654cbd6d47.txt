Jimmy: THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD. OH, I SEND THE LOVE RIGHT BACK TO YOU GUYS. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOT A BIG SHOW. THEY'RE ALL IN THE PARTY MOOD. I WANT TO WISH EVERYBODY A A HAPPY CINCO DE MAYO, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ HAPPY CINCO DE MAYO! EVERYBODY'S CELEBRATING CINCO DE MAYO. IN FACT, EARLIER, I SAW FLOYD MAYWEATHER AND MANNY PACQUIAO PRETENDING TO HIT A PINATA. MORE LIKE HUGGING IT. BUT STILL -- IT WAS WORTH IT, IT WAS WORTH IT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. IT WAS GREAT. [ APPLAUSE ] IT WAS THE BEST. IT WAS THE BEST. TODAY IS CINCO DE MAYO. THOUGH, IF YOU'RE REALLY EXCITED BY THAT, THE CHANCES OF YOU BEING AT HOME WATCHING "THE TONIGHT SHOW" RIGHT NOW ARE PRETTY SLIM. [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT TACO BELL -- WE LOVE TACO BELL. THEY CELEBRATED CINCO DE MAYO BY GIVING AWAY FREE BISCUIT TACOS BETWEEN 7:00 AND 11:00 THIS MORNING. [ CHEERS ] OF COURSE, GIVING AWAY FREE FOOD MAKES THEM LOOK GOOD, BUT THEY'RE ALSO SMART ENOUGH TO DO IT WHEN THEY KNOW STONERS ARE ASLEEP. NO ONE'S GONNA SHOW UP BETWEEN 7:00 AND 11:00. COME ON. ARE WE GOING TO GET UP FOR A A TACO? NO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, WHEN THEY HEARD TACO BELL WAS CELEBRATING CINCO DE MAYO BY GIVING OUT FOOD BETWEEN 7:00 AND 11:00, STONERS WERE LIKE, "WAIT, 7-ELEVEN'S GIVING OUT SINKS FULL OF MAYO? [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S GO, DUDE!" SOME POLITICAL NEWS HERE. ANOTHER PERSON HAS ANNOUNCED THEY'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THIS TIME, IT'S FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] WOO! YOU CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENT.
Steve: YEAH, ELECTRIC!
Jimmy: THE FLOOR'S SHAKING, YEAH. THE ROOM'S SHAKING. GET THIS, I READ THAT HE ACTUALLY PLAYED IN A ROCK BAND CALLED CAPITAL OFFENSE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH JEB BUSH, WHO RECENTLY JOINED A A MARIACHI BAND. [ LAUGHTER ] DELITO CAPITAL! OH, THIS IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE HERE. BERNIE SANDERS'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCED THAT IT RAISED OVER $1.5 MILLION IN THE 24 HOURS AFTER HE ANNOUNCED HIS BID. MEANWHILE, A 12-YEAR-OLD ON KICKSTARTER JUST RAISED $7 MILLION IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES AFTER ANNOUNCING HIS IDEA FOR JUICEBOX WATER GUNS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S BIG NEWS FOR THE SANDERS CAMPAIGN. BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO CAMPAIGNS AND HOW MUCH THEY COST, $1.5 MILLION, IT DOESN'T REALLY BUY YOU THAT MUCH REALLY. I MEAN, JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE AD THEY JUST RELEASED. ♪♪
I'M BERNIE SANDERS -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU KIND OF GET THE GIST, I THINK. THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY, BUT WHILE BERNIE SANDERS RUNS FOR PRESIDENT HERE IN THE U.S., HE ACTUALLY HAS AN OLDER BROTHER RUNNING FOR PARLIAMENT IN THE U.K. CAN WE SEE BERNIE SANDERS AGAIN? [ LAUGHTER ] HOW MUCH OLDER CAN HIS BROTHER BE? [ LAUGHTER ] WHO IS HE, GANDALF? [ LAUGHTER ] SOME TV NEWS HERE. NBC HAS ADOPTED NETFLIX'S STRATEGY FOR ITS LATEST SUMMER TV SERIES "AQUARIUS", AND WILL RELEASE ALL 13 EPISODES THE SAME NIGHT IT PREMIERES. SEEMS RIDICULOUS TO ME. I CAN'T IMAGINE NBC EVER USING THE NETFLIX FORMAT. I MEAN, HOW COULD IT WORK? SKIP TO THE NEXT EPISODE? I LOVE NETFLIX, BUT I JUST DON'T SEE THAT WORKING FOR NBC. THIS IS PRETTY INTERESTING. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY, MEN AND WOMEN PREFER HAVING SEX AT OPPOSITE TIMES OF THE DAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. RESEARCHERS SAY THAT MEN PREFER THE MORNING, WHILE WOMEN PREFER NOT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] DIFFERENT TIMES. DIFFERENT TIMES.

WHAT'S HAPPENING? [ SCREAMING ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. NO MORE BATH SALTS FOR BRUNO. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S JUST TOO MUCH. THAT'S THE THING. LEARN A LESSON. THIS IS INTERESTING NEWS. I HEARD THAT LOOSE WRANGLER JEANS ARE SLOWLY MAKING A A COMEBACK, BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T BUYING SKINNY JEANS ANY MORE. TOO TIGHT.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T LIKE THE TIGHT PANTS.
Steve: NO.
Jimmy: NO. WRANGLER IS USING THE SLOGAN, "LIFE IS COMFORTABLE." WHICH BEATS THE OTHER SLOGAN, "BECAUSE YOU LIKE BREAD." [ LAUGHTER ] BREAD IS GOOD. BREAD IS DELICIOUS.
Steve: BREAD IS GOOD.
Jimmy: BREAD IS DELICIOUS. AND GET THIS, I READ THAT AS MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION BECOMES MORE POPULAR, IT COULD ACTUALLY AFFECT THE JOBS OF DRUG SNIFFING DOGS. OR AS THOSE DOGS PUT IT, "THANKS, BO OBAMA." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. AS MORE PLACES LEGALIZE WEED, SOME POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE RETIRING THEIR DRUG- SNIFFING DOGS. BUT DON'T WORRY, THE RETIRED DOGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED BY STONERS WHO FORGET WHERE THEY PUT THEIR WEED. [ LAUGHTER ] COME ON, GIRL. I KNOW I HAD A ROACH HERE SOMEWHERE. TIMMY'S IN TROUBLE. TIMMY'S IN TROUBLE! WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, EVERYBODY. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: DUDE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THE SHOW AGAIN.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME, MAN.
Jimmy: CONGRATS ON ALL THESE GREAT MOVIES. DO YOU GO BY JAMES YOUR WHOLE LIFE. EVEN AS A KID, JAMES?
NO, I WAS JIMMY, ACTUALLY. MY FAMILY, THEY STILL CALL ME JIMMY. I GREW UP AS JIMMY. I STARTED -- WHEN I GOT INTO ACTING, I FOUND SOME EARLY SUCCESS AND STARTED TO SHOW UP IN LIKE THE TEENY BOP MAGAZINES.
Jimmy: RIGHT.
JIMMY SOUNDED A LITTLE TOO BUBBLEGUMMY FOR ME. SO I WANTED TO TAKE, YOU KNOW, MY CAREER A LITTLE MORE SERIOUSLY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MAYBE BUBBLEGUMMY IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD. IT'S MORE SORT OF LIKE INFANTILE OR LIKE, SOPHOMORIC. YOU KNOW? IT WAS JUST NOT PROFESSIONAL. I GUESS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. IF YOU HAD THE NAME JIMMY --
YEAH, IT JUST DOESN'T -- IT DOESN'T MEAN I'M HERE, I MEAN BUSINESS. YOU KNOW?

YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S A COMEDY. BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S A VERY DARK COMEDY.
YEAH, IT IS.
Jimmy: AT ONE POINT IT JUST SCREECHES TO A HALT AND SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENS. I DON'T WANT TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT.
IT'S LIKE A JOHN HUGHES MOVIE GONE REALLY, REALLY DARK.
Jimmy: YEAH. WELL, JACK IS THE GUY WHO RUNS ALUMNI AT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL AND HE'S TRYING TO GET EVERYONE BACK TO THE 20-YEAR REUNION. AND YOU PLAY THE COOL KID WHO WENT TO THE HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU'RE A BIG STAR NOW IN HIS EYES BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A BANANA BOAT COMMERCIAL.
RIGHT, RIGHT. SO HE THINKS IF GETS ME, THE COOLEST GUY IN HIGH SCHOOL TO COME BACK FOR THE REUNION, EVERYONE WILL SHOW UP. BUT HE THINKS I'VE MADE IT IN HOLLYWOOD BECAUSE I'M IN THIS LIKE LAME COMMERCIAL. I'VE BEEN THERE FOR 20 YEARS. HE DOES FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET ME TO COME BACK. IT'S SO INTERESTING BECAUSE I WAS NOT THAT GUY IN HIGH SCHOOL.
Jimmy: YOU WERE NOT THE COOL?
NO I WAS NOT.
Jimmy: OH, COME ON.
LISTEN, EVERYONE ALWAYS WANTS TO TALK ABOUT I'M THE NERD.
Jimmy: I WAS SO GAWKY AND AWKWARD, MAN.
NO, I WAS LIKE A REAL DRAMA NERD. ACTUALLY, THE DIRECTORS NEEDED A PHOTO OF ME FROM HIGH SCHOOL. THEY'RE LIKE, "SEND US A PHOTO, LIKE, YOUR HIGH SCHOOL PHOTO YOU LOOKING SORT OF BAD ASS AND COOL HAIR." IT'S LIKE, "I DON'T HAVE ANY." AND THEY SAID, "NO, NO, JUST LIKE LOOKING LIKE A -- YOU KNOW, LIKE A LADIES MAN, LIKE A COOL GUY." I SAID, "I DON'T. THERE'S NONE. I'M LIKE, I WAS NOT THAT GUY." SO I SENT THEM WHAT I HAD. THEY SENT ME AN E-MAIL BACK AND SAID, "THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM." [ LAUGHTER ] AND JACK, JACK LOOKS LIKE A --
Jimmy: WE HAVE THE PHOTO. AND YOU TELL ME IF THIS IS NOT A COOL DUDE. HE'S THE GUY WEARING THE JOCK T-SHIRT RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH.

Jimmy: PLEASE CUT THAT OUT AND MAKE MEMES OF THAT, LIKE JOCK JIMMY IN SPACE. WHAT KIND OF SCENE, WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS SCENE? [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S UH --
Jimmy: I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HECK'S GOING ON.
THOSE ARE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS. AND I'M MAYBE GETTING READY TO GO FOR A RUN? I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU'RE A JOCK.
YOU KNOW, I WAS AN ATHLETE. SEE? IT SAYS SO RIGHT THERE ON THE SHIRT.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT SAYS SO ON YOUR SHIRT.
