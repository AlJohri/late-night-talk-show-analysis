Questlove: 271!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S A HOT CROWD. HOT CROWD. OH, HEY, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! LOOKING GOOD! HOT CROWD, BABY, HOT CROWD. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I APPRECIATE THAT. LET'S GET TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. HILLARY CLINTON JUST ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WILL OFFICIALLY KICK OFF HER PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ON JUNE 13th IN NEW YORK CITY. AND GOOD NEWS, IT'S FREE TO GET IN. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIND OUT IT'S $100,000 TO GET OUT. AND YOU GO, THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE ALL THEIR MONEY, YEAH. BUT SHE'S GETTING MORE AND MORE COMPETITION BY THE DAY. REPUBLICAN LINDSEY GRAHAM OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN YESTERDAY AND SAID, QUOTE "I HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE WITH OUR NATIONAL SECURITY THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE. THAT INCLUDES YOU, HILLARY." [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH WOULD HAVE SOUNDED A LOT TOUGHER IF EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY GO, "RAWR." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WINK.
Jimmy: BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT LOOKS LIKE YET ANOTHER REPUBLICAN MAY BE ENTERING THE RACE. THAT'S RIGHT. ACCORDING TO AN E-MAIL FROM HIS STAFF YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP IS SET TO MAKE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT ON JUNE 16th. I MEAN, SERIOUSLY? AT THIS POINT, DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCING HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS LIKE SOCCER'S WORLD CUP. IT HAPPENS EVERY FOUR YEARS AND NO ONE IN AMERICA CARES. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF SOCCER, THERE'S A A PRETTY BIG STORY ABOUT FIFA TODAY. CHECK THIS OUT.
SHOCKING NEWS OUT OF THE WORLD OF SOCCER. THE FIFA PRESIDENT, SEPP BLATTER, ANNOUNCED HE'S RESIGNING ONLY FOUR DAYS AFTER HE WAS RE-ELECTED.
Jimmy: YEAH. NOW SEPP BLATTER WILL GO BACK TO SOUNDING LIKE A DISEASE YOU LOOK UP ON WEB MD. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK GOD. I THOUGHT I HAD SEPP BLATTER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEW. THAT'S RIGHT. THE 79-YEAR-OLD FIFA PRESIDENT SEPP BLATTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS RESIGNING LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER THE ORGANIZATION WAS ROCKED BY A CORRUPTION SCANDAL. BUT IF YOU ONLY LEARNED ONE THING FROM ALL THIS, IT'S THAT YOU CAN NEVER TRUST A A 79-YEAR-OLD BLATTER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT DEPENDS.
Jimmy: WHAT'S THAT?
Steve: DEPENDS.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO GO.
Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T PISS THEM OFF. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOT A GREAT BASKETBALL PLAYER.
Steve: WHY IS THAT?
Jimmy: BUT HE'S GOOD DRIBBLER. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HE'S NUMBER ONE IN MY BOOK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHEW.
Jimmy: HE'S EUROPEAN. THAT'S RIGHT.
Steve: DIDN'T COUNT. THIS DOESN'T COUNT.
Jimmy: HE'S EUROPEAN. THAT'S RIGHT. HERE'S A PRETTY SCARY STATISTIC HERE. ACCORDING TO A NEW INVESTIGATION, 95% OF UNDERCOVER TSA AGENTS WERE ABLE TO SNEAK THROUGH AIRPORT SECURITY WITH FAKE BOMBS AND WEAPONS WITHOUT BEING DETECTED. 95%. THIS IS REAL. AND BECAUSE OF THIS, THE TSA CHIEF MELVIN CAROWAY WAS FORCED TO RESIGN. CAROWAY HIMSELF RELEASED A A STATEMENT REGARDING THE SECURITY BREACH SAYING, QUOTE "I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WRONG. WE NONCHALANTLY SHINE A TINY FLASHLIGHT ON PEOPLE'S I.D.s, HAVE THEM PUT THEIR SHOES IN PLASTIC BINS, AND THEN ASK THEM PUT THEIR LAPTOPS IN SEPARATE PLASTIC BINS FOR NO REASON. [ LAUGHTER ] WE PROCEED TO HAVE THEM STAND IN A WEIRD TUBE AND PUT THEIR HEADS IN A DIAMOND SHAPE ABOVE THEIR HEADS SO WE CAN LAUGH AT THEIR NUDE BODIES. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, AS IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH, WE ANGRILY YELL AT THEM TO KEEP THE LINE MOVING ONCE THEIR BAGS COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE MAY HAVE MISSED 95% OF THE WEAPONS, BUT WE CAUGHT 100% OF THE MINI SHAMPOO BOTTLES. TAKE THAT, AL QAEDA."
Steve: WOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. DANGEROUS. HEY, I SAW THAT McDONALD'S IS ANNOUNCING CHANGES TO ITS FOOD TO IMPROVE ITS TASTE, WHICH INCLUDES TOASTING ITS BUNS FOR AN EXTRA FIVE SECONDS. I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME McDONALD'S WORKERS HAVE EMPLOYED THE FIVE-SECOND RULE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE GROANS ] THIS IS KIND OF COOL HERE. I SAW THAT A PIZZERIA IN BROOKLYN RECENTLY MADE NEWS AFTER POSTING A PHOTO OF A A PIZZA TOPPED WITH MINI SLICES OF PIZZA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MANY PEOPLE RETWEETED THE PICTURE WHILE CHRIS CHRISTIE ACTUALLY TRIED TO SWIPE RIGHT.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT -- IT'S JUST A PHOTO.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: YOU DON'T DO THAT. IT'S A PHOTOGRAPH. [ APPLAUSE ] THIS HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE EXCITED. YESTERDAY, "FIFTY SHADES OF GREY" AUTHOR, E.L. JAMES, ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WILL RELEASE A NEW VERSION OF THE BOOK LATER THIS MONTH FROM CHRISTIAN GREY, THE MAN'S, POINT OF VIEW. SHE'S RERELEASING THE BOOK BUT FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW. YEAH, AND IT TURNS OUT THE STORY IS PRETTY DIFFERENT FROM A MALE PERSPECTIVE. LET'S COMPARE THE TWO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FOR EXAMPLE, THE ORIGINAL VERSION SAYS, "BEFORE I KNOW IT, HE'S GOT BOTH OF HIS HANDS IN HIS VISELIKE GRIP ABOVE MY HEAD AND HE'S PINNING ME TO THE WALL USING HIS LIPS." WHILE THE GUY VERSION SAYS, "WE MADE OUT. IT WAS AWESOME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TAKE A LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE. THE ORIGINAL VERSION SAYS, "HIS VOICE IS WARM AND HUSKY, LIKE DARK MELTED CHOCOLATE FUDGE CARAMEL." THE GUY VERSION IS, "MY VOICE IS WICKED HORSE FROM YELLING AT THE SOX GAME LAST NIGHT." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, THE ORIGINAL VERSION SAYS, "HE PULLED ME CLOSE AND RIGHT AWAY I COULD TELL HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING." THE GUY VERSION SAYS, "I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT I'M DOING." [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

Jimmy: IT'S NOT A LOW-BUDGET FILM. I MEAN, YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN. WHERE DID YOU SHOOT THIS, LIKE IN --

Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: OUR MOVIE.
YEAH. "JURASSIC WORLD."
YEAH.
Jimmy: BECAUSE, SPOILER ALERT, I HAVE A CAMEO IN "JURASSIC WORLD." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I CAN'T BELIEVE I MADE THE CUT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I TOTALLY THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET CUT OUT BECAUSE THEY ASKED ME TO DO THIS TINY LITTLE THING, AND THEN -- I DON'T WANT TO RUIN IT FOR YOU, BUT IT MADE IT.
IT'S ESSENTIAL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL, BUT THANK YOU. DID YOU SEE IT? DID YOU SEE IT IN FRONT OF --
YEAH, I SAW IT. I SAW IT LIKE TWO WEEKS AGO.
Jimmy: DID PEOPLE REACT? HOW WAS I?
YEAH. THEN I SAW IT AGAIN AND PEOPLE ARE LIKING IT.
Jimmy: AGAIN, ME. PEOPLE ARE -- HOW ABOUT MY PART?
OH, I MEAN -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW -- ARE THEY REALLY ENJOYING MY PART?
THEY WERE CRYING. THEY WERE SO MOVED.
Jimmy: NO, NO. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY.
THEY WERE LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY! THEY WERE DYING! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S THE MOST FUN MOVIE. YOU'RE FANTASTIC IN IT.
THANK YOU. SO ARE YOU.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. IT'S JUST THE BEST IDEA. I JUST LOVE IT. 'CAUSE I'M A FAN OF "JURASSIC PARK," OBVIOUSLY. BUT THIS THING IS LIKE EVERY KID IN THE WORLD IS GOING TO LOVE THIS. I JUST THINK THE IDEA IS GREAT. I THINK THE ACTORS, EVERYONE, THE CAST IS PERFECT, THE DIRECTOR --. IT'S JUST PHENOMENAL. YOU'RE FANTASTIC IN IT. CHRIS PRATT.
KILLER, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. MY PART. UNBELIEVABLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
GAME CHANGER.
Jimmy: GAME CHANGER.
LIKE WE KNEW WHEN YOU WERE CAST, WE WERE, LIKE, THIS IS A A REAL MOVIE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT WILL SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY BECAUSE JIMMY'S IN IT.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. BUT BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS IS NOW 22 YEARS LATER.
YES, FROM "JURASSIC PARK."
Jimmy: FROM "JURASSIC PARK." IT'S NOW "JURASSIC WORLD."
YEAH, BECAUSE JURASSIC PARK WAS A P.R. NIGHTMARE.
Jimmy: DO YOU THINK?
SO MANY PEOPLE DIED, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOT GOOD FOR A THEME PARK.
NO, NO, NO.
Jimmy: BUT YOU'VE UPPED SECURITY.
YES, EVERYTHING IS RE-BRANDED, YES.
Jimmy: BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO UP YOUR DINOSAURS, KIND OF.
WELL, YEAH. I MEAN, DINOSAURS HAVE NOW BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE AND KIND OF NOBODY'S IMPRESSED ANYMORE.
Jimmy: YEAH. THEY'RE BORED.
THEY'RE SORT OF BORED.
Jimmy: THEY'RE BORED WITH IT. THERE'S LIKE A PETTING ZOO.
YEAH.
Jimmy: SO WELL DONE. EVEN THE TINY LITTLE THINGS LIKE THE GIFT SHOP AND EVERYTHING. I LOVE THEME PARKS AND ALL THAT STUFF. I KNOW I'M 40 YEARS OLD, BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I WAS LIKE, I KNOW THAT, I KNOW EXACTLY THAT. AND THEN AT ONE POINT THERE'S A A PETTING ZOO WHERE KIDS CAN PET DINOSAURS.
MY KID'S IN THAT SCENE.
Jimmy: GUESS WHAT, I JUST FOUND THAT OUT. AND I KNOW WHICH KID IS YOUR KID.
WITH THE HUGGING OF THE DINOSAUR.
Jimmy: YEAH, I LOVE THAT, YEAH. HE WAS FANTASTIC. THAT'S THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE. TELL HIM I SAID THAT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT WAS GREAT. THEY THOUGHT OF EVERY SINGLE THING. SO NOW THE BILLIONAIRE GUY WHO OWNS JURASSIC WORLD, HE CHOPPERS IN TO MEET WITH YOU AND HE'S LIKE, "WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR ME? I NEED A NEW ATTRACTION. BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE BORED."
BIGGER, BADDER, SCARIER, MORE TEETH, COOLER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YES.
Jimmy: LIKE GETTING A NEW ROLLER COASTER AT A THEME PARK.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: SO YOU NEED A NEW DINOSAUR. SO, YOU'RE GENETICALLY MAKING THESE DINOSAURS.
YEAH, WE MAKE ONE THAT IS SCARIER AND PEOPLE WANT TO SEE AND IT'S COOLER, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS. REALLY DANGEROUS.
Jimmy: AND YOUR NEPHEWS COMES TO VISIT.
YES.
Jimmy: THEY'RE COMING TO THE PARK AND THEY'RE LIKE "WE WANT TO HANG OUT, GO TO THE PARK, CAN YOU HOOK US UP?" BECAUSE YOU RUN THE PARK.
YEAH, BUT I'M BUSY.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A BUSINESS WOMAN.
NATURALLY, I RUN THE PARK. NOT JUST WALKING AROUND.
Jimmy: THESE TWO KIDS GO OUT AND HAVE THIS ADVENTURE AND THEY THINK THEY'RE JUST HAVING FUN AT JURASSIC PARK OR JURASSIC WORLD, BUT THEN IT'S A A CRAZY DISASTER.
THEN JIMMY COMES IN.
Jimmy: DON'T SPOIL IT YET, BUT I SAVE THE DAY. YEAH. I FIGHT A DINOSAUR AT THE END AND IT'S JUST SO REALISTIC.
JIMMY, STOP, THEY'RE GOING TO KILL YOU.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, YEAH, THOSE GUYS WILL GET MAD AT ME. BUT IT IS SO -- I JUST LOVE IT, IT PUT ME IN THE MOOD OF THOSE MOVIES. THOSE GIANT SPIELBERGY MOVIES, WHERE YOU WATCH THOSE THINGS AND YOU GO "OH YEAH, IT'S LIKE A POPCORN MOVIE." THE EFFECTS ARE KILLER, YOU GET SCARED. BUT YOU JUST FEEL LIKE A LITTLE KID AGAIN TOO IN CERTAIN PLACES. LIKE, THE ADVENTURE OF IT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I JUST THINK IT'S SO GREAT. I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT.
I LOVE THAT YOU USED "SPIELBERGY" AS AN ADJECTIVE. IS THAT AN ADJECTIVE?
Jimmy: IS "SPIELBERGY" AN ADJECTIVE? YEAH, I THINK IT IS.
IT'S LIKE A "SPIELBERGY MOVIE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? BECAUSE IT'S FAMILY --
TOTALLY, YEAH.
Jimmy: -- BUT THAT'S THE THING YOU GET FROM "JURASSIC PARK" AND "E.T." AND "JAWS." AND I THINK EVEN JAWS MIGHT MAKE A CAMEO OR ONE OF JAWS' RELATIVES. YOU'LL SEE, BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD. I GOT A BIG REACTION WHERE I WAS. IT'S SCARY, IT'S FUN. I LOVED IT SO MUCH. I THINK THE CLIP I WANT TO SHOW HERE IS BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD TALKING TO THE BILLIONAIRE MOGUL GUY.
YEAH. IRRFAN KHAN IS PLAYING MASRANI, THE BILLIONAIRE.
Jimmy: MASRANI, AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW HIM WHAT THE NEW ATTRACTION WILL BE.
YES.
Jimmy: AND HERE YOU GO. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE NEW ATTRACTION? [ ECHO ]
"THE INDOMINUS REX."
Jimmy: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE OF "JURASSIC WORLD." BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD. [ GROWLING ]
ALL WHITE? NO ONE TOLD ME IT WOULD BE ALL WHITE.
THINK IT WILL SCARE THE KIDS?
THE KIDS? THIS WILL GIVE THE PARENTS NIGHTMARES.
IS THAT GOOD?
THAT'S FANTASTIC. [ GROWLING ]
Jimmy: YEAH! I LOVE IT SO MUCH!
I'M SO EXCITED.
Jimmy: ME TOO! SO EXCITED. I'M GOING TO SEE IT AGAIN, BY THE WAY. I LOVE IT THAT MUCH. BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD, "JURASSIC WORLD" IS IN THEATERS JUNE 12th. FLORENCE AND THE MACHINE PERFORM FOR US AFTER THE BREAK. COME ON BACK, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
