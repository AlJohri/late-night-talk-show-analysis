[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GUYS ARE THE SHOW. TOGETHER, WE'RE ALL THE SHOW. GOOD LOOKING CROWD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, LAST NIGHT, WE HAD THE FINAL DEMOCRATIC DEBATE BEFORE THE IOWA CAUCUSES IN FEBRUARY, AND IT GOT HEATED. YEAH. IN FACT, AT ONE POINT, BERNIE SANDERS ATTACKED HILLARY CLINTON FOR TAKING $600,000 IN SPEAKING FEES FROM GOLDMAN SACHS. IN RESPONSE, HILLARY WAS LIKE, "OH, COME ON. THAT WAS ONE SPEECH. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? GIVE ME A BREAK." [ APPLAUSE ] BUT OVERALL, MOST EXPERTS SEEM TO THINK THAT BERNIE SANDERS WAS THE WINNER OF LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE. YOU COULD TELL BERNIE WON WHEN AT THE END HE STOOD UP AND YELLED, "BINGO! [ LAUGHTER ] WAIT. WHAT HAPPENED? [ APPLAUSE ] WHERE AM I?" MEANWHILE, HILLARY CLINTON SPOKE ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AS SECRETARY OF STATE. CHECK OUT WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY ABOUT HIM.

MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM, IT'S -- IT'S -- IT'S INTERESTING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
