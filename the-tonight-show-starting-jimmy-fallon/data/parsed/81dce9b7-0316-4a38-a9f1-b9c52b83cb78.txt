Jimmy: AND IT'S A BIG DEAL. ARE YOU EXCITED?
YEAH. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT AND NICOLE IS AMAZING AND REESE IS AMAZING. THEY BOTH PRODUCED THE SHOW AS WELL. SO THEY WERE SUPER INVOLVED.
Jimmy: I DON'T REALLY KNOW THEM THAT WELL.
YOU -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW NICOLE. YOU WENT ON A DATE WITH NICOLE ONCE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE SEEN THAT EPISODE. GOOD JOB, BRO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW -- I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS ON A DATE WITH HER.
I KNOW. IT WAS --
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS REALLY AWKWARD. IT WAS REALLY BAD.
I'VE HAD BAD DATES, TOO. IT'S FINE.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS THE WORST DATE YOU'VE EVER HAD?
THE WORST DATE?
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY NAMES.
OF COURSE NOT. I WENT ON A DATE --
Joel: SAY A NAME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: JOEL! NO, NO.
HE'S RIGHT. BAD INFLUENCE.
Joel: JAKE GYLLENHAAL EVERYBODY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS A HORRIBLE TIME.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY WHO IT WAS, BUT WHAT WAS IT?
OKAY. NOT JAKE GYLLENHAAL. NO. NOT JAKE GYLLENHAAL. I WENT ON A DATE WITH THIS GUY. THE DATE ITSELF WAS ACTUALLY FUN. YOU KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT MOVIES AND MUSIC AND HE TOLD ME HE JUST GOT A NEW TURTLE AND THE DATE WAS FINE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE NEXT DAY I WENT HOME AND HE CALLS ME. MY PHONE RANG. AND I -- I ASSUMED AND I WAS LIKE, I KILLED IT LAST NIGHT. HE'S GOING TO ASK ME OUT ON A A SECOND DATE. I PICK UP THE PHONE. AND HE SAYS, "REMEMBER I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT LITTLE GARY, MY TURTLE?" SO I SAID, "YEAH." AND HE SAYS, CAN YOU WATCH HIM FOR A FEW DAYS? [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS -- I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED. AND I SAID, I DON'T THAT'S A A GREAT IDEA. AND LIKE, MY ROOMMATE DOESN'T, I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD BE COOL WITH THAT. AND MY ROOMMATE WHO LOVES ANIMALS OVERHEARD ME. WAS LIKE, "YES! LET'S TAKE THE TURTLE." [ LAUGHTER ] SO -- YOU KNOW, I SAID, ALL RIGHT. WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING? HE SAID, TONIGHT. I'M GOING TO BRING HIM OVER RIGHT NOW ON MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT. SO HE COMES OVER AND DROPS OFF A DUFFEL BAG, SAYS THANKS AND LEAVES. AND THE BAG STARTS MOVING. AND I'M LIKE, ALL RIGHT. LITTLE GARY'S IN HERE, I GUESS. SO I OPEN THE DUFFEL BAG AND INSIDE IS A 30-POUND AFRICAN TORTOISE. [ LAUGHTER ] WITH A BAG OF HALF -- LIKE ALMOST FINISHED DRY DOG FOOD.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT WHAT HE EATS.
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WHAT TORTOISES EAT. SO -- IT -- YOU KNOW, AT LEAST BRING A FULL BAG. YOU CAN SHOW A PICTURE OF HIM IF YOU WANT.
Joel: THAT JAKE GYLLENHAAL IS WEIRD. [ LAUGHTER ]
SO I HAVE THIS TURTLE FOR ABOUT A WEEK. AND I CALL THE GUY. AND I'M LIKE, DUDE, WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK INTO TOWN?
Jimmy: GOT TO PICK UP GARY.
HE'S GOT TO COME PICK UP LITTLE GARY.
Jimmy: LITTLE GARY.
AND HE SAYS, YOU KNOW MY TRIP GOT EXTENDED. AND SO WE KEEP LITTLE GARY FOR LIKE ANOTHER WEEK AND HE'S BECOME LIKE, HE BECOMES LIKE THE NEIGHBORHOOD MASCOT. LIKE, PEOPLE COME OVER. WE HAVE BARBECUES. WE LOVE GARY. SO THEN IT'S BEEN MAYBE A MONTH SINCE WE'VE HAD HIM AND MY PHONE RINGS AND IT'S GARY'S FATHER CALLING. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL CALL HIM GARY'S DAD. AND SO NOW, I SAY, "OKAY, THIS GUY'S OBVIOUSLY CALLING ME TO TALK ABOUT THE GIANT 30-POUND AFRICAN TORTOISE THAT HE LEFT AT MY HOUSE."
Jimmy: YEAH.
NO. HE WAS CALLING ME TO ASK ME ON A SECOND DATE. HE SAID HE'S BACK IN TOWN AND HE WANTS TO KNOW IF I WANT TO GO TO SEE A MOVIE. AND SO I'M THINKING, THIS GUY WHO YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW, CALLS YOU, AND AFTER HE LEAVES HIS GIANT AFRICAN TORTOISE AT YOUR HOUSE, DOESN'T SAYING ANYTHING, ASKS YOU ON A SECOND DATE. THIS IS INSANE. SO OBVIOUSLY I SAY, YEAH WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT TO GO? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT TIME -- WHAT TIME ARE YOU PICKING ME UP?
SO, WHAT TIME SHOULD I BE THERE?
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I GO ON A SECOND DATE WITH THIS GUY -- I KNOW, I KNOW.
Jimmy: I FEEL LIKE HE'S A A SUPER COOL DUDE. I'M STARTING TO THINK HE REALLY IS JAKE GYLLENHAAL.
NO I -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND I JUST -- AND IT'S INSANE THAT WE DIDN'T ONLY TALK ABOUT THE FACT HE LEFT A GIANT AFRICAN TORTOISE AT MY HOUSE. SO JUST HAD LIKE A SECOND DATE. THAT WAS FINE.
Jimmy: ARE YOU STILL DATING HIM NOW?
NO.
Jimmy: IS GARY AROUND?
YES. SO, I'M ALMOST FINISHED. I SWEAR. SO, WE GO BACK -- WE GO BACK TO HIS HOUSE FOR A NIGHT CAP AND I SEE HE LIVES. AND I SEE THAT THERE IS, LIKE, STUFF ON THE GROUND. THERE'S NO OUTDOOR SPACE. AND ALL I'M THINKING IS, "GARY CAN'T LIVE HERE." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS CAN'T BE GARY'S HOME.
Jimmy: YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR GARY'S BEST INTERESTS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO I -- I ALSO REMEMBER THAT I HADN'T FED GARY. BECAUSE I DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE OUT SO LATE. SO I SAY TO THE GUY, I'M LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT. I GOT TO GO HOME." AND HE'S LIKE, "WHY?" I GOT TO GO HOME AND FEED MY TURTLE GARY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH. "MY" TURTLE GARY. [ APPLAUSE ] LOSER!
AND I KEPT HIM FOR THE ENTIRE SUMMER AND THEN WE DONATED HIM TO A TURTLE SANCTUARY AND HE'S VERY HAPPY NOW. SO --
