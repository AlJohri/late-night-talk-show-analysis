Questlove: 166.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH MY GOODNESS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, YOU LOOK GREAT. OH, FANTASTIC! WELCOME, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. BIG SHOW TONIGHT -- JON STEWART MAKING HIS FIRST APPEARANCE ON OUR SHOW TONIGHT. EVER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: UNBELIEVABLE. BIG SHOW. BIG "TONIGHT SHOW," WE'RE VERY -- HOT CROWD, THAT'S WHY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE FEELING WHY IT'S A HOT SHOW TO BE AT. IT'S THE SHOW TO BE AT. VERY EXCITING. WELL, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. YOU GUYS, THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS ARE OVER AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOW IN CHARGE OF CONGRESS. AND GET THIS, YESTERDAY HOUSE REPUBLICANS PICKED AN ALL-MALE GROUP OF NEW COMMITTEE CHAIRS FOR NEXT YEAR'S SESSION. THEY'VE ACTUALLY COME UP WITH A A PRETTY GOOD NAME FOR THAT ALL-MALE GROUP -- NO DIRECTION. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY INTERESTING. ALL MALE. [ APPLAUSE ] DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS, HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER WAS LOOKING PRETTY GRUMPY YESTERDAY DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY, BUT LETS SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT HAD HIM IN BAD MOOD.
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S PRIORITIES. IT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF CALLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE STUPID.
GOOD MORNING. DON'T KNOW IF YOU ALL GOT A A CHANCE TO YESTERDAY WISH THE SPEAKER A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
Steve: OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT!
Jimmy: THEN BOEHNER GRABBED THE MIC AND WAS LIKE, "I MEAN, DAMN IT GUYS, NOT EVEN ONE BALLOON, I MEAN COME ON! CARVEL'S DOWN THE STREET, COULDN'T GET ME A CAKE OR SOMETHING? PUT MY NAME ON  -- WHATEVER. JOHN IS A PRETTY COMMON NAME!" [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: VERY ANGRY. THIS IS VERY BIG. YESTERDAY THE SENATE CAME, THEY CAME UP ONE VOTE SHORT OF GETTING APPROVAL TO BUILD THE KEYSTONE XL OIL PIPELINE. DEMOCRATS SAID THE PIPELINE COULD ACCELERATE GLOBAL WARMING AND THEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE TODAY WERE LIKE, "SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S ACCELERATE THIS -- LET'S ACCELERATE THIS GLOBAL WARMING. [ APPLAUSE ] LETS DO IT NOW." THIS IS A LITTLE SCARY. A MYSTERIOUS RUSSIAN SATELLITE IS APPARENTLY DRIFTING THROUGH SPACE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED, BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A HARMLESS CIVILIAN MISSION OR SOME KIND OF WEAPON. AND VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS LIKE, "YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT TIL CHRISTMAS TO FIND OUT." [ LAUGHTER ] [ JIMMY LAUGHING LIKE PUTIN ] LITTLE BIT OF SCANDAL HERE. CHEF GORDON RAMSAY BELIEVES THAT HIS RESTAURANT OPENING IN LONDON WAS SABOTAGED THIS WEEKEND. THAT'S RIGHT, AFTER A A COMPETITOR, HE THINKS BOOKED UP THE ROOM USING FAKE ONLINE RESERVATIONS. THERE'S NO ONE THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] OPENING NIGHT, HE THINKS A A COMPETITOR BOOKED ALL THESE ONLINE RESERVATIONS AND DIDN'T SHOW UP. YEAH, OFFICIALS HAVE NARROWED IT DOWN TO EVERYONE WHO HAS EVER WORKED FOR GORDON RAMSAY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO WE DON'T KNOW WHO IT COULD BE. "DONKEY GET OUT OF THERE! MAKE AN OMELET! ALL RIGHT!" THIS IS KIND OF COOL. I SAW THAT THE VATICAN IS RAFFLING OFF SOME OF THE POPE'S BELONGINGS FOR CHARITY. INCLUDING A TANDEM BICYCLE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHILE THE POPE APPRECIATES ALL GIFTS HE RECEIVES, EVEN HE WAS LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL AM I GOING TO DO WITH A TANDEM BICYCLE? I MEAN I'M THE POPE, WHAT AM I --." TANDEM BICYCLE. THE POPE SAYS THAT HE'S GOING TO GIVE AWAY THE TANDEM BECAUSE JESUS NEVER PEDALS ON THE UPHILLS. [ LAUGHTER ] I CARRIED YOU THE WHOLE TIME. I WAS CARRYING YOU THE WHOLE TIME. EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THE NEW MOVIE, "THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY PART 1" WHICH COMES OUT THIS FRIDAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EVERYONE IS BUZZING ABOUT IT.

THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I MEAN, THIS IS -- IT'S NOT LIKE, I WAS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING WELL MAYBE HE'S GOING TO SHOOT IT I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU WOULD SHOOT THIS FILM. LIKE MAYBE A BACK LOT SOMEWHERE.
SURE. IF WE HAD THE MONEY FOR THAT, I THINK WE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT.
Jimmy: IT WAS CHEAPER. BUT YOU ACTUALLY WENT AROUND THE WORLD.
WE WENT TO -- WE FILMED IT IN JORDAN. IT'S ABOUT IRAN BUT FILMED IT IN JORDAN. I WANTED TO GET AS CLOSE TO THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR AS I COULD WITHOUT BEING IN IT. SO THAT'S -- WE WERE ABOUT 40 MILES FROM THAT.
Jimmy: I MEAN THAT'S SO --
BUT OMAN IS A VERY SORT OF CALM AND QUIET AND STABLE CITY.
Jimmy: IT IS. WERE YOU SCARED AT ALL?
I'M SCARED RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YOU'RE ALWAYS SCARED.
THIS SUIT IS MADE OUT OF PURELL. THAT'S HOW I LIVE MY LIFE. WE WERE SHOOTING IN OMAN, BUT THE FIRST FOUR DAYS WE SHOT IN A JORDANIAN PRISON, WHICH WAS -- THAT WAS INTIMIDATING. BECAUSE IT WAS STILL WORKING. IT'S NOT A FAKE JORDANIAN PRISON. IT'S A JORDANIAN PRISON, SO IT HAD JORDANIAN PRISONERS.
Jimmy: AND THEY DON'T APPRECIATE YOU FILMING THERE.
YEAH, THERE WASN'T A LOT OF LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU GUYS MAKING, A COMMERCIAL?" [ LAUGHTER ] "WHO'S IN THIS? OOH!" THEY WERE MOSTLY LIKE --
Jimmy: MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY? I MIGHT EVEN MEET MATTHEW. YEAH, THEY WON'T DO THAT.
THEY'RE MORE LIKW, "YEAH, WE'RE MURDERERS AND WE DON'T APPRECIATE THIS." [ LAUGHTER ] "WHAT, ARE YOU DRAMA-TA-TIZING OUR CRIMES? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING?"
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT HOW WAS IT -- HOW CAN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THE CREW AND EVERYTHING AS YOU'RE DIRECTING?
SEMAFOUR, IT WAS ALL FLAGS.
Jimmy: REALLY? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU KNEW SEMAFOUR.
I DIDN'T, EITHER, UNTIL I GOT THERE. OBVIOUSLY I SPEAK ENGLISH SO -- AND THEY DIDN'T.
Jimmy: THEY DO NOT?
THEY APPRECIATED HEARING IT. BUT --
Jimmy: THEY LAUGHED. LLL
THEY LAUGHED A LOT, THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND IT, SO THERE WAS A LOT OF THAT. I CAME UP WITH THAT SORT OF ONE PHRASE THAT YOU COULD DO, I WOULD INTRODUCE MYSELF. I WOULD SAY -- [ SPEAKING ARABIC ] WHICH MEANS "I AM JON." [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] WHICH MEANS "WHO ARE YOU?" AND I WOULD DO THAT EVERY MORNING TO THEIR DELIGHT. THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GREATEST -- I'D SAY -- [ SPEAKING ARABIC  ] THEY WOULD SAY THEIR NAME AND I WOULD SAY -- [ SPEAKING ARABIC ] WHICH MEANS "IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU." BUT APPARENTLY COMING FROM IDIOT BOY, THAT THAT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING THEY EVER HEARD. [ LAUGHTER ] "THE IDIOT HAS LEARNED AN ARABIC PHRASE!" THEN THEY WOULD ALL HUG.
Jimmy: YOU WOULD DO IT EVERY DAY?
I WOULD DO IT EVERY DAY. AND ON MY WAY HOME. I WOULD DO IT AT LUNCH. WHENEVER I FELT THE MORALE FLAGGING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHENEVER THE PRISONERS WOULD COME BY AND SCARE EVERYBODY I'D GO, [ SPEAKING ARABIC ] [ LAUGHTER ] [ SPEAKING ARABIC ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
AND THEY LOVE THAT. IT'S VERY HOSPITABLE. IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN, IT'S INCREDIBLY HOSPITABLE IN TERMS OF THE REGION IS, YOU KNOW, IT'S PART OF THEIR CULTURE IS VERY MUCH OF LIKE, YOU WILL COME TO MY HOUSE. BUT IT'S WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT IT IS IT'S AN AGGRESSIVE HOSPITALITY IN A WAY THAT YOU WOULD MEET PEOPLE ON THE STREET AND THEY WOULD BE LIKE, "HOW LONG ARE YOU HERE?" "I'M GOING TO BE HERE FIVE WEEKS." "YOU WILL COME TO MY HOUSE." [ LAUGHTER ] "WELL, I'M WORKING." "YOU'LL BE THERE AT 8:00. I'LL COME AT 8:00 TO PICK YOU UP." [ LAUGHTER ] "I'M NOT GONNA --" "YOU'LL MARRY ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. OKAY, YEAH.
"YOU'LL BE IN MY FAMILY, YOU'LL LIVE IN MY HOUSE. YOU'LL BE ME, YOU'LL WEAR MY CLOTHES AND YOU'LL BE ME." LLL
Jimmy: "YOU WILL BE ME FOR TWO WEEKS."
"YOU'LL BE ME FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. YOU'LL LIVE HERE AND I WILL LIVE OUTSIDE." [ LAUGHTER ] "I WILL LIVE OUTSIDE AND I WILL BE NAKED AND I WILL CRY AT NIGHT, BUT IT IS OKAY, BECAUSE I JUST MET YOU." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY'RE THAT HOSPITABLE.
THEY'RE THAT HOSPITABLE. IT WAS CRAZY.
Jimmy: AND THE STORY IS BASED ON A BOOK.
A BOOK "THEN THEY CAME FOR ME" NOW CALLED "ROSEWATER." IT'S ABOUT AN IRANIAN JOURNALIST WHO WAS THERE FOR THE 2009 ELECTION. HE JUST GOT SWEPT UP IN THE CRACKDOWN. ALL DID HE WAS FILM A SCENE OF AN ATTACK ON A BASE THERE, LIKE A BESIEGED POLICE BASE, AND THEY THREW HIM IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR FOUR MONTHS AND DIDN'T, YOU KNOW, HE HAD A A PREGNANT WIFE AT THE TIME.
Jimmy: HE WAS LIVING IN LONDON, RIGHT?
HE WAS LIVING IN LONDON, BUT HE HAD GONE TO TEHRAN TO COVER THE ELECTION.
Jimmy: AND THEN HE STARED SEEING THINGS IN FILMS GOING, YOU HAVE THE TOOL RIGHT THERE, THAT'S THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON. YOU HAVE A CAMERA.
YOU HAVE A CAMERA, YEAH, SO THE IDEA IS BASICALLY SOCIAL MEDIA AND BEARING WITNESS TO SORT OF SOMETHING NOW THAT ANYBODY CAN DO THAT IT'S BEEN DEMOCRATIZED, BUT THESE REGIMES ARE CRACKING DOWN EVEN MORE. AND WE ACTUALLY DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM ON "THE DAILY SHOW," JASON JONES DID. AND WHEN HE WAS IN PRISON, IN HIS INTERROGATION, THEY SHOWED HIM A CLIP FROM "THE DAILY SHOW." 'CAUSE IN THE CLIP JASON SAID, "I'M AN AMERICAN SPY AND I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU, WHY IS IRAN SO SCARY?"
Jimmy: BUT HE WAS DRESSED LIKE A --
HE WAS DRESSED IN A KAFFIYA, SUNGLASSES ON, A BIG HAT AND WAS SMOKING A A CIGARETTE.
Jimmy: IT'S CLASSIC LIKE A A CARTOON SPY.
A CARTOON SPY. AND HIS INTERROGATOR SAID, "WHY IS AN AMERICAN SPY TALKING TO YOU?" AND MAZIAR WHEN HE WAS IN PRISON SAID, "WHY WOULD AN AMERICAN SPY HAVE A TELEVISION SHOW?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU CAN IMAGINE IT WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE.
Jimmy: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S CLEARLY A JOKE AND YOU GO LIKE MAN, AND YOU SEE HOW IT JUST BECOMES --
YEAH. YOU GOT TO GO OVER THERE AND YOU GOTTA SAY TO THE AYATOLLAH, "COME ON! COME ON!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: RIGHT OTHER YOUR HEAD, BUDDY.
RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD.
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T GET IT. BUT MAN OH MAN, IT'S FRUSTRATING TO GO, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED. AND I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE, THIS IS A CLIP HERE. THIS IS JON STEWART'S NEW FILM, "ROSEWATER." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
AS A SPY I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY YOUR COUNTRY IS SO TERRIFYING?
THE FIRST THING TO KNOW ABOUT IRAN IS THAT IT IS NOT EVIL. ACTUALLY, AMERICANS AND IRANIANS HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN COMMON, MORE THAN THEY HAVE DIFFERENCES.
WHAT DO I HAVE IN COMMON WITH YOU?
WHAT IS NUMBER ONE ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES?
AL QAEDA.
AL QAEDA IS ALSO THE NUMBER ONE ENEMY OF IRAN. AL QAEDA MEMBERS SAY THAT IF YOU KILL AN IRANIAN OR IF YOU KILL A SHIITE, YOU GO TO HEAVEN AND YOU GET 72 VIRGINS.
WELL, THEY WON'T BE VIRGINS FOR TOO LONG, HUH? RIGHT? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? UP STAIRS? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE LEFT HIM HANGING THERE.
HE LEFT HIM HANGING.
Jimmy: BUT IT GOES TO SHOW YOU JUST HOW WE LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW --
WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE. WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE.
Jimmy: APPRECIATE THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND I GOTTA SAY WITH YOU'RE USING WHAT YOU HAVE, YOUR COMEDY AND YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO MAKE CHANGE IN THE WORLD. AND I GOTTA SAY AS A FAN OF YOURS --
OH NO, THAT'S WHY I GOT IN THE BUSINESS. I ALWAYS SAID I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO USE MY FREEDOM OF SPEECH. LLL
Jimmy: YOU ACTUALLY ARE DOING IT.

Jimmy: THESE LITTLE PARTY MONKEYS, WE GAVE OUT THESE MONKEYS.
YES. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU CALLED THEM PARTY MONKEYS, WE CALL THEM "JIMMY THE MONKEY" AFTER YOU BECAUSE THEY HAVE THESE CAPES. WHEN I WAS ON "LATE NIGHT" WITH YOU --
Jimmy: I ALWAYS WEAR CAPES, YOU KNOW ME. YEAH, YEAH.
RIGHT, EXACTLY. AND WE HAVE A FEW OF THEM AND THEY'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE WITH US.
Jimmy: IT'S ALMOST CRAZY. I SAW WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING "TOP CHEF" --
YEAH, THAT'S JIMMY THE MONKEY RIGHT THERE.
Jimmy: THAT'S A TINY MONKEY THERE.
HE'S ON THE CAMERA. THAT'S ON SET. THIS IS IN SOME VINEYARD, HE'S HANGING OUT. HE'S A LITTLE DRUNK.
Jimmy: HE'S A LITTLE DRUNK, YEAH. FROM A VINEYARD. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT TEXAS?
THAT'S TEXAS. THAT IS TEXAS.
Jimmy: I MEAN, I LOVE THAT.
HE WAS PUNISHED FOR BEING TOO DRUNK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU HUNG HIM ON A A CACTUS.
I HUNG HIM ON A CACTUS, YEAH.
Jimmy: WE DON'T, UH, WE DON'T MAKE THESE ANY MORE.
YOU DON'T MAKE THEM ANYMORE?
Jimmy: NO, THESE, WELL --
NO, WAIT A MINUTE. THE WAY I SOLD ME BEING HERE TO KRISHNA, I WAS LIKE, "HONEY, MOMMY IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO ON JIMMY FALLON. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GET WHEN I COME HOME?"
Jimmy: NO, I --
NO, NO, NO.
Jimmy: WE'RE "THE TONIGHT SHOW" NOW, WE DON'T HAVE "TONIGHT SHOW" PARTY MONKEYS.
NO, SOMEBODY HAS TO HAVE ONE. LIKE ONE OF YOUR OTHER GUESTS. IF ANYBODY -- IF ANYONE'S WATCHING, ANYONE HAS A MONKEY, A PARTY MONKEY? CAN YOU PLEASE TWEET AT ME? @PADMALAKSHMI.
Jimmy: JUST BUY ONE ON EBAY. PARTY MONKEYS.
I WILL BUY ONE.
Jimmy: NO, ACTUALLY WE HAD A A FEW. WE HAD A FEW MADE.
OH, NO!
Jimmy: HERE'S ONE FOR YOUR DAUGHTER AND ONE FOR YOU.
THAT IS SO AWESOME. SHE IS GOING TO BE SO EXCITED.
Jimmy: DOES IT MAKE A NOISE?
THANK YOU. THEY USED TO DO IT, WATCH. [ MONKEY SOUND ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT, YEAH, THANK YOU, YEAH. YEAH, THANK YOU, YEAH. YEAH, RIGHT THERE, THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE.
THANK YOU, THIS IS SO AWESOME.
Jimmy: THAT'S FOR YOU AND KRISHNA. NO PLEASE.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A ROCK STAR YOU'RE GOING TO BE AT CASA PADMA.
Jimmy: HOW OLD IS KRISHNA?
KRISHNA IS FOUR AND THREE-QUARTERS GOING ON 17. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ALREADY? YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
NO, SHE, YEAH. SHE --
Jimmy: WHAT ELSE IS SHE INTO BESIDES PARTY MONKEYS?
SHE'S INTO "FROZEN."
Jimmy: OF COURSE, YEAH.
LIKE EVERY OTHER CHILD ON THE PLANET.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO BE.
I MEAN, WE WENT RECENTLY TO THIS "FROZEN ON ICE" THING.
Jimmy: YES.
IT'S EXACTLY AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE IT WOULD BE.
Jimmy: I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT. WHAT WAS IT LIKE?
ACTUALLY, JIM, JIM WAS THERE. I KNOW YOU HAD JIM.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
ANYWAY, SO, LIKE, WE WERE THERE AND I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF STUFF AT BARCLAYS. IT WAS AT THE BARCLAYS CENTER. EVEN OPENING NIGHT WHEN JAY-Z WAS PERFORMING, WHICH WAS REALLY ROWDY AND CRAZY.
Jimmy: OH YEAH.
BUT I HAVE NEVER, EVER SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS. THERE WERE POLICE EVERYWHERE ON THE STREETS. THERE WERE BARRICADES. THERE WERE GUYS, YOU KNOW, POLICE OFFICERS, DO NOT LET GO OF YOUR CHILDREN. DO NOT LET GO OF YOUR CHILDREN. PLEASE, DO NOT CROSS UNTIL WE TELL YOU, YOU CAN CROSS. LIKE --
Jimmy: REALLY? HUNDREDS OF LITTLE GIRLS.
HUNDREDS, OF LIKE --
Jimmy: DRESSED LIKE ELSA.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: LIKE AN ARMY.
AND THEY ALL HAD SWORDS, AND LIKE, TOYS, AND COTTON CANDY.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE A RIOT.
THEY WERE ALL HOPPED ON SUGAR.
Jimmy: YOU SHOULD FILM IT AND MAKE A MOVIE CALLED "FROZEWATER."
Jimmy: YOU SHOULD FILM IT AND MAKE A MOVIE CALLED "FROZEWATER." [ LAUGHTER ]
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: RELEASED IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN THE POLICE SO TERRORIZED. IT'S LIKE PRESCHOOL APOCALYPSE.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND IT JUST --
ALL OF THESE FOUR YEAR-OLDS, ALL OF THESE PARENTS LOOKING LIKE THEY REALLY NEED A DRINK. [ LAUGHTER ] AND ALL THESE POLICE OFFICERS TOTALLY TERRIFIED.
Jimmy: DID SHE LOVE IT THOUGH ONCE SHE GOT IN? AFTER SHE WAS SCARED.
SHE LOVED IT. SHE DID LOVE IT. SHE SAID MOM I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE SPECTACULAR. I SAID KRISHNA, THERE'S A LIMIT TO WHAT YOU CAN DO ON ICE, YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL SHE'S USED TO WATCHING "TOP CHEF,."
YEAH, RIGHT, YEAH.
Jimmy: "I THINK THIS COULD BE A LITTLE MORE SPECTACULAR, MOM." IT'S A GRILLED CHEESE, EAT IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH. SHE'S VERY OPINIONATED ABOUT FOOD, IT'S FUNNY.
Jimmy: AND "TOP CHEF," ONE OF MY FAVORITES, IT'S IN BOSTON THIS SEASON.
OH MY GOD. RIGHT, YOU DID "FEVER PITCH."
Jimmy: OH I LOVE BOSTON. YOU SAID AFTER TONIGHT IT GETS CRAZIER AS IT GOES ON.
IT GETS CRAZIER. YOU SAID AFTER TONIGHT IT GETS CRAZIER AS IT GOES ON.
IT GETS CRAZIER. BUT YOU KNOW TONIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE CHEFS REALLY GOT THEIR GROOVE. LIKE IT'S BEEN PRETTY UNEVEN AND ONE PERSON HAS BEEN WINNING A LOT. BUT I THINK TAKING THEM TO PLYMOUTH WHERE WE MADE THEM USE ONLY WHAT WAS AVAILABLE IN THE 17th CENTURY. SO NO FORKS, NO IMMERSION BLENDERS, NO NOTHING. IT WAS LIKE, IF YOU WANTED TO COOK MEAT, YOU HAD TO COOK IT ON THE SPIT. EVEN WHEN WE WERE EATING YOU ONLY HAD SPOONS AND FORKS. I'M SORRY, SPOONS AND KNIVES. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE FORKS THEN. AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT BROUGHT THE BEST OUT IN THE CHEFS.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO FUN.
IT REALLY, REALLY -- I MEAN, SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN STRUGGLING, HONESTLY COOKED THE BEST MEAL THAT THEY HAD COOKED ON "TOP CHEF" SINCE THEY'VE BEEN THERE.
Jimmy: WE ALWAYS LIKE PEOPLE TO LEARN FROM WHEN THEY WATCH OUR SHOW. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WATCH THE "TONIGHT SHOW." THEY GO, JIMMY, WHAT CAN WE LEARN? BUT I WANTED TO KNOW, IF YOU CAN, GIVE THREE QUICK TIPS ON THANKSGIVING. HOSTING THANKSGIVING. DO YOU HAVE ANY TIPS AT ALL?
YES, I DO. THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IS INVITE SOME STRANGERS OR MIX UP YOUR INVITE LIST.
Jimmy: JUST PEOPLE OFF THE STREET?
WELL, NO, NO, NO, NO. BUT YOU KNOW, THANKSGIVING IS ALWAYS LIKE, REALLY HARD BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS FAMILY FIGHTING AND STUFF. IT'S NICE TO HAVE A VARIED GUEST LIST. SO LIKE, THERE'S STRANGERS THAT YOUR FAMILY WOULD MAYBE BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT ARGUE IN FRONT OF. YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: AH, THAT'S VERY, VERY SMART. [ LAUGHTER ]
SO THEY'LL BE ON A GOOD BEHAVIOR, OR IT ALSO MAKES IT INTERESTING. YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YOU'VE BEEN TO MY FAMILY AT THANKSGIVING. [ LAUGHTER ]
I HAVE EATEN WITH ALL OF YOUR FAMILY, AND NANCY'S. SO YOU'LL SEE. YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD TIP.
I KNOW EVERYBODY.
Jimmy: ANY OTHER TIPS?
YES. THE OTHER THING IS COOK YOUR TURKEY BEFOREHAND. WHEN WE COOK TURKEY AT MY HOUSE WE COOK IT ACTUALLY AT MIDNIGHT THE NIGHT BEFORE. WE DO IT ON THANKSGIVING AND ON CHRISTMAS. AND WE START COOKING AT MIDNIGHT. AND THEN WE FINISH COOKING AT 6:00 A.M. IT'S EXCITING GETTING UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND MAKING SURE THE TURKEY IS BEAUTIFUL. AND THAT WAY THE HARD PART IS DONE. I NEVER UNDERSTAND WHEN PEOPLE ARE COOKING TURKEY AFTER EVERYONE GETS THERE. AND IT'S LIKE, A NAIL BITING EXPERIENCE. YOU WANT TO SOAK THE TURKEY IN BUTTERMILK. NOT MILK. BUTTERMILK THAT'S SALTED AND SUGARED.
Jimmy: OKAY. THAT'S HOW I MAKE MY HOT DOGS.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A LITTLE BUTTERMILK.
AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE --
Jimmy: REALLY, BUTTERMILK?
YEAH. BUTTERMILK BECAUSE IT HAS MORE ENZYMES IN IT THAT WILL BREAK DOWN THE DARK MEAT. AND SO.
Jimmy: GREAT TIPS. YES. I LOVE THEM.
YES, THEY'RE VERY GOOD. AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE LEGS AND THIGHS ARE IMMERSED, YOU WANT TO PUT IT LEG-DOWN IN A TALL, NARROW THING. AND YOU WANT TO DO THAT FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN COOK THAT STUFF OVERNIGHT AND ALSO PUT APPLES AND ORANGES INTO THE BIRD. SO IT GETS RID OF THE GAMINESS AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL OF THIS JUICE, DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE JUICE WHEN YOU'RE DONE, BECAUSE TAKE THAT JUICE AND ADD SOME BUTTER AND FLOUR TO IT AND THAT'S YOUR NATURAL HOME-MADE GRAVY.
Jimmy: THESE TIPS, IS THIS UNBELIEVABLE OR WHAT. I MEAN RIGHT THERE I GAVE YOU SOME GREAT -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE NEVER GIVE OUT TIPS, I'M SO HAPPY. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. PADMA LAKSHMI RIGHT THERE. ABSOLUTELY. "TOP CHEF" AIRS WEDNESDAYS, 10:00 P.M. ON BRAVO. GREAT TO SEE YOU, PAL.
YEAH.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT'S, THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL BY LOOKING AT ME, BUT I'M A MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, I AM. IT'S EASIER TO BE A GUY, REALLY. I MEAN THERE'S SEXISM. BUT JUST THE DAY-TO-DAY LIFE OF BEING A WOMAN. HONESTLY, IT LOOKS TOO HARD. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST, HAIR, WHAT A WOMAN HAS TO DEAL WITH, WITH HAIR. WITH CUT AND COLOR AND GOOS AND POTIONS. IT'S LIKE, WHAT DOES A GUY HAVE TO DO WITH HIS HAIR? NOT HAVE A MULLET. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ALL A GUY HAS TO DO. [ APPLAUSE ] IS NOT HAVE A MULLET. A-PLUS AND YET, THERE'S STILL SOME GUYS THAT CAN'T PULL THAT OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] "THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MY MULLET, ARE THEY?" IT'S EASIER TO BE A GUY. MAKEUP? WOMEN WEAR MAKEUP. MOST GUYS DON'T EVEN WASH THEIR HANDS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SEE IT AT THE PUBLIC REST ROOM. YOU'RE LIKE WHERE YOU GOING? THEY'RE LIKE, "I'M NOT SERVING FOOD HERE." A BRA, AN EXTRA PIECE OF CLOTHING. I THINK WOMEN SHOULDN'T WEAR BRAS AND THEN THEY SHOULD JOG BY MY APARTMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I'M A FEMINIST LIKE BEYONCE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY WIFE LOVES THAT JOKE. OBVIOUSLY WOMEN ARE DOING NONE OF THESE THINGS TO PLEASE OR IMPRESS A MAN. BUT SOME OF IT'S SELF-INFLICTED. LIKE THAT EYEBROW THING? THAT'S ON YOU, LADIES. I MEAN, THERE'S NOT A MAN ON THIS PLANET THAT'S SITTING THERE GOING, "I'M LOOKING FOR A A WOMAN WHO HAS REMOVED 90% OF HER EYEBROW HAIR. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT I FIND A TURN-ON." I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SOME OF THESE LADIES ARE GOING FOR. "I WANT TO LOOK CONSTANTLY SURPRISED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LIKE, I'M ABOUT TO EAT A BABY." MY WIFE IS A WOMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE IS. SHE'S VERY ATTRACTIVE AND THIN. I LOOK LIKE I HAD TWO WIVES AND I ATE ONE OF THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE IS AMAZING. WE DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER. SHE'S MY WRITING PARTNER. SHE'S INTELLIGENT. SHE'S -- SHE'S -- [ LAUGHTER ] CREE-AH-TIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE IS AMAZING. I MEAN, WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER, I WON'T LET HER DRIVE. THAT'S NOT SEXISM. I JUST DON'T WANT TO DIE. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN SHE CAN DRIVE MY KIDS AROUND, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. BUT IF I'M IN THE CAR? NO WAY! SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE -- PROBABLY THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THING MY WIFE CAN DO IS HER ABILITY TO REMEMBER ABSOLUTELY EVERY HORRIBLE THING I'VE EVER DONE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE'LL JUST BRING IT UP. WE'LL BE WATCHING TV AND SHE'LL BE LIKE, "REMEMBER THAT TIME YOU HUMILIATED ME WHEN WE WENT OUT TO DINNER?" "NOW I DO. I MUST HAVE BLOCKED IT OUT SEARCHING FOR SELF-ESTEEM." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. I DON'T WANT TO MISREPRESENT HER, SHE'S VERY FORGIVING. IT'S JUST THE FORGETTING PART. YOU KNOW, I MEAN WE ALL ASPIRE TO BE FORGIVING. POPE JOHN PAUL II FORGAVE THE GUY WHO TRIED TO ASSASSINATE HIM. I MEAN GRANTED HE WAS THE POPE, IT'S NOT LIKE HE COULD BE LIKE, "LET'S TORCH THIS [ BLEEP ]." HE WAS THE POPE, SO HE HAD TO FORGIVE HIM. BUT HE WENT TO HIS JAIL CELL AND FORGAVE THE GUY. BUT THEN HE LEFT, IT'S NOT LIKE THEN HE LIVED WITH THE GUY. LIKE IF THE POPE LIVED WITH THE GUY, WE WOULD HAVE SEEN HOW LONG THAT FORGIVENESS WOULD HAVE LASTED. "POPE, YOUR TURN TO DO THE DISHES?" "DIDN'T YOU SHOOT ME? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK IT'S ALWAYS YOUR TURN TO DO THE DISHES." THE POPE, THAT'S A TOUGH JOB. ANYONE POPE HERE? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW POPE'S A TOUGH JOB, BECAUSE THE LAST ONE QUIT. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S LIKE, "I'M DONE." AND THE VATICAN ARE LIKE, "YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SPEAK FOR GOD UNTIL YOU DIE." AND THE POPE IS LIKE, "AH, GOD TOLD ME TO QUIT. [ LAUGHTER ] HE TOLD ME TO EAT MORE CHEESE." MY WIFE LOVES TALKING ON THE PHONE AND I WOULD RATHER BE HIT BY A CAR. I MEAN, NOT A BIG CAR, BUT A A MINI COOPER. I WOULD TAKE THAT OVER A A 20-MINUTE CONVERSATION. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE IS CALLING ANYONE. IT'S LIKE WHENEVER I GET A A PHONE CALL, I ALWAYS LOOK AT THE PHONE AND I THINK, "YOU BETTER BE CALLING TO TELL ME YOUR HANDS ARE CHOPPED OFF." [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S EMAIL AND TEXTS. YOU KNOW? MY DAUGHTER'S LIKE, "OH, I JUST WANTED TO HEAR YOUR VOICE, DADDY." BUY MY ALBUM, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I WANT TO RAISE PROBLEM-SOLVERS. I'M KIDDING, KIND OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: JIM GAFFIGAN! OH MY GOSH. JIM GAFFIGAN RIGHT THERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HIS BOOK, "FOOD: A LOVE STORY," IS OUT RIGHT NOW. OH, MY GOSH. HE'S AT FOXWOODS CASINO DECEMBER 13th. WHAT'S THE NAME OF YOUR OTHER BOOK?
"DAD IS FAT." [ LAUGHTER ]
