Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- JENNIFER GARNER, CUBA GOODING JR., MUSICAL GUEST PETE YORN, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: WOO!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AH HA! ELECTRIC! OH, HOT CROWD HERE IN NEW YORK CITY TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW", EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HERE'S WHAT EVERYBODY -- OH, I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, LAST NIGHT, WE HAD A A LOT OF PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES. AND IT WAS A HUGE NIGHT FOR HILLARY CLINTON, WHO WON IN FIVE STATES. AND AFTERWARDS SHE GAVE A A SPEECH AND GRACIOUSLY THANKED BERNIE SANDERS FOR THE VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN HE'S WAGING, THEN SAID -- [ CLEARS THROAT ] "AND LOSING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE, DURING BERNIE SANDERS'S SPEECH AFTER THE LOSSES, BERNIE SPOKE UP AGAINST THE FAMILY THAT OWNS WAL-MART FOR PAYING LOW WAGES. WHICH COULD BACKFIRE IN A A COUPLE WEEKS WHEN BERNIE WINDS UP WORKING AS A GREETER. [ LAUGHTER ] "WELCOME TO WAL-MART, OR WHATEVER. BUY SOMETHING OR NOT. I DON'T CARE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DONALD TRUMP WON EVERY REPUBLICAN STATE PRIMARY LAST NIGHT EXCEPT FOR OHIO, WHICH WENT TO JOHN KASICH. TRUMP DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND SINCE HE SAID, AS HE PUT IT, "THE WORD 'OHIO' IS FULL OF ZEROS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT STARTS WITH ZERO AND ENDS WITH ZERO." THAT'S RIGHT, JOHN KASICH HAD A A BIG NIGHT LAST NIGHT, WINNING HIS HOME -- YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I LIKE THAT ONE, TOO. JOHN KASICH HAD A BIG NIGHT LAST NIGHT, WINNING HIS HOME STATE OF OHIO. THEY EVEN DROPPED CONFETTI AT THE END OF HIS VICTORY SPEECH. BUT I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SUCH A THING AS TOO MUCH CONFETTI. LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHO WON? I DON'T KNOW WHO WON. I CAN'T SEE. OH, MY GOSH. [ APPLAUSE ] OH, MY GOODNESS. AND TODAY, KASICH ANNOUNCED THAT THE CONFETTI CLEANUP HAS CREATED 100 NEW JOBS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO ALREADY IT'S WORKING. KASICH WAS LIKE, "MIGHT AS WELL USE IT UP. I'M NOT GOING TO NEED IT AGAIN." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE AWS ] LET'S BE HONEST. OH, REALLY? YEAH, OKAY. DONALD TRUMP GAVE HIS VICTORY SPEECH LAST NIGHT AT HIS MAR-A-LAGO CLUB IN PALM BEACH. AT LEAST ONE OF HIS SUPPORTERS SEEMED PRETTY HAPPY TO GET ON CAMERA. CHECK OUT ONE GUY IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE NEWS REPORT. WATCH THIS.
HE HAS NOT YET TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WOULD OFFSET THE COST OF POTENTIALLY HAVING THAT LABOR HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. A REPORTER TRIED TO ASK HIM ABOUT THAT ABOUT A WEEK AGO, AND HE TOLD THE REPORTER THAT NOBODY WAS LISTENING TO HIM. ALSO TALKED ABOUT BRINGING THE PARTY TOGETHER. MENTIONED A PHONE CALL WITH MITCH McCONNELL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "I THINK I JUST PHOTO BOMBED." ACTUALLY, DONALD TRUMP GAINED A A LOT OF DELEGATES WITH HIS PRIMARY WINS LAST NIGHT. AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE HIT A A REALLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBER. [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OHS ] YEAH. WHEN TRUMP SAID HE WAS GOOD AT MAKING DEALS, I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS THAT GOOD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THE OTHER BIG STORY FROM LAST NIGHT WAS THAT MARCO RUBIO PULLED OUT OF THE RACE AFTER LOSING THE FLORIDA PRIMARY TO TRUMP BY ALMOST 20 POINTS. BUT IT STILL IS A GREAT STORY. I MEAN, NOTHING SYMBOLIZES AMERICA MORE THAN THE SON OF POOR IMMIGRANTS GROWING UP TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND THEN BEING CRUSHED BY A BILLIONAIRE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: AMERICA.
Jimmy: AMERICA.
Steve: A BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN TALE.
Jimmy: YOU SEE THIS? "THE NEW YORK TIMES" RAN A A STORY PROFILING DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER BUTLER. AND IN THE ARTICLE, THE BUTLER REVEALED THAT TRUMP WEARS A A WHITE HAT WHEN HE'S IN A GOOD MOOD AND A RED HAT WHEN HE'S IN A BAD MOOD. EVEN CRAZIER, POPE FRANCIS DOES THE SAME THING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DON'T WANNA -- HE'S IN A BAD MOOD. SEE HOW UPSET HE IS? SEE HOW UPSET HE IS?
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THIS IS A BIG DEAL HERE. PRESIDENT OBAMA NOMINATED APPEALS COURT JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT. JUDGE GARLAND ACTUALLY GOT CHOKED UP WHILE ACCEPTING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NOMINATION IN THE WHITE HOUSE ROSE GARDEN. ESPECIALLY WHEN OBAMA WAS LIKE, "WILL YOU ACCEPT THIS ROSE?" [ LAUGHTER ] "I WAS ACTUALLY IN LOVE WITH TWO JUDGES UNTIL THE VERY END." OF COURSE, A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE WONDERING HOW THE NOMINATIONS PROCESS IS GOING TO WORK. AND I'M NOT SURE REPORTERS ARE REALLY DOING A VERY GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING IT. TAKE A LOOK.
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS TEND TO BE A RATHER COMPLEX KABUKI DANCE.
REPUBLICANS AND PETER ARE BOTH CORRECT ON THE PROCESS.
RIGHT.
BUT TRYING TO EXPLAIN PROCESS IS COMPLICATED.
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A A CONFIRMATION. ANTHONY KENNEDY WAS CONFIRMED --
IN AN ELECTION YEAR.
IN 1988 -- IN 19 -- IN THE YEAR THAT --
REAGAN WAS --
THAT, THAT, WELL, THAT GEORGE W. BUSH -- GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH WAS RUNNING TO SUCCEED HIM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE -- THE --THE -- THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED WAS IN THE YEAR THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, WHICH WAS LEAP YEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] BY THE WAY, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PAID TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO YOU. JUST SO YOU KNOW -- JUST SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT THEY DO FOR -- OH, THIS IS JUST CRAZY. I SAW THAT SOME RESEARCHERS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY HAVE MADE TINY ROBOTS THAT ARE MODELED AFTER BUGS AND FOUND THAT SIX OF THEM COULD ACTUALLY MOVE A A CAR WEIGHING ALMOST TWO TONS. YEAH. WHILE TWO REAL NEW YORK CITY COCKROACHES CAN ACTUALLY FLIP THE CAR OVER AND SET IT ON FIRE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO, THEY'RE CLOSE.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: THEY'RE DOING WHAT WE DO, BUT WE DO IT EVERY DAY.
Steve: PATIENCE, PATIENCE.
Jimmy: HEY, THIS IS COOL. 7-11 WILL HOLD ITS SECOND ANNUAL BRING YOUR OWN CUP DAY, WHERE IT WILL GIVE CUSTOMERS A A DISCOUNT ON SLURPEES AS LONG AS THEY BRING IN ANY CONTAINER RESEMBLING A CUP. IN A RELATED STORY, HOME DEPOT JUST SOLD OUT OF TRASH CANS. [ LAUGHTER ] SOLD OUT. [ APPLAUSE ] "CHERRY AND BLUE --"
Steve: SUICIDE.
Jimmy: MY FAVORITE FLAVOR IS BLUE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, THIS IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL, YOU GUYS. SELENA GOMEZ JUST BECAME THE MOST FOLLOWED PERSON ON INSTAGRAM, WITH ALMOST 70 MILLION FOLLOWERS. [ CHEERS ] WHEN REACHED FOR A COMMENT, KIM KARDASHIAN SAID, "I CAN'T GET ANY MORE NAKED, GUYS. I MEAN I GAVE YOU EVERYTHING I GOT." [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! HOT CROWD! A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT, TOO. IT'S GOING TO BE FUN. IT'S BEEN A GREAT WEEK SO FAR. THERE'S MORE AHEAD. TOMORROW NIGHT, GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD-WINNING CLIVE OWEN WILL BE HERE.
Steve: OH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THEN ON FRIDAY, JOHN KRASINSKI IS STOPPING BY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE SOMETHING FUN GOING ON WITH HIM. BUT FIRST, WE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. WE LOVE THIS WOMAN. FROM THE NEW FILM, "MIRACLES FROM HEAVEN," JENNIFER GARNER IS HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GORGEOUS.
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: FUNNY. GREAT ACTOR.
Steve: TALENTED.
Jimmy: WE'RE GOING TO CATCH UP WITH HER. THEN JENNIFER AND I ARE GOING TO PLAY A BRAND-NEW GAME CALLED "TRUTH OR DOOR."
Steve: OOH. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ]

Steve: CLASSY.
Jimmy: YEAH, THANK YOU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] PLUS HE STARS IN THE NEW SERIES, "THE PEOPLE VERSUS O.J. SIMPSON." ARE YOU WATCHING THIS THING?
Steve: YES. INSANE.
Jimmy: IT IS PHENOMENAL. EVERYBODY IN THE SHOW, JUST PERFECTLY CAST, AND JUST WOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. IT'S JUST A CRAZY STORY. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S --
Steve: IT'S REAL.
Jimmy: REAL.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT HE'S FANTASTIC IN IT. CUBA GOODING JR. IS DROPPING IN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PLAYS O.J. THE WHOLE THING IS NUTS. CUBA GOODING JR., REMEMBER WHEN HE HOSTED "SNL"?
Steve: YES.
Jimmy: AND HE WAS GREAT. HE WAS A GOOD HOST.
Steve: HE WAS PURE ENERGY.
Jimmy: HE WAS THE FIRST GUY THAT INTRODUCED ME TO -- WE WENT OUT TO DINNER WITH LORNE AND YOU. AND HE GOES, "I'LL HAVE PROSCIUTTO AND MELON." I GO, "WHAT?" I DON'T KNOW WHAT PROSCIUTTO -- I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT PROSCIUTTO WAS.
Steve: RIGHT.
Jimmy: I GO, "WHAT AND MELON? WHY ARE YOU GETTING THAT?" AND HE GOES, "YOU NEVER HAD PROSCIUTTO AND MELON?" IT'S LIKE A SPICY -- OH, NO, IT'S A SALTY HAM. I GO, "NO." ANYWAYS, I GOT IT. AND IT'S PHENOMENAL. BUT ANYWAYS, HE TURNED ME ON TO THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHY. IT'S NOT A GOOD STORY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: IT'S A TRUE STORY.
Jimmy: IT'S TRUE. THANK YOU.
Steve: THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT REAL.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: IT ISN'T FUNNY.
Jimmy: NOT NECESSARILY FUNNY. THAT'S OUR SLOGAN.
Steve: THAT'S OUR SLOGAN.
Jimmy: WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." NOT NECESSARILY FUNNY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: LOOK AT THIS. THAT'S MY MAN, PETE YORN. YOU GUYS, WHENEVER I GET SOME DOWN TIME HERE AT THE SHOW, I LIKE TO GO ON INSTAGRAM AND SCROLL THROUGH ALL THE PHOTOS.
Steve: REALLY? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] REALLY?
Jimmy: ONE THING I NOTICED IS THAT A LOT OF TIMES TWO PEOPLE WILL WRITE THE EXACT SAME CAPTION --
Steve: UH-HUH.
Jimmy: BUT THE PICTURES THEY POST WILL BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
Steve: I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IN THIS NEW SEGMENT -- IT'S TIME FOR -- IT'S NOT A NEW SEGMENT. THE NEXT SEGMENT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE. AGAIN, THE SHOW IS NOT 100% TRUE. SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU CAUGHT IT AT HOME, THAT WASN'T TRUE. IT'S TIME FOR "PICTURE THIS." HERE WE GO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ PICTURE THIS PICTURE THIS PICTURE THIS ♪ ♪ YEAH PICTURE THIS ♪
Jimmy: BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THIS BIT BEFORE.
Steve: YEAH.

IT IS.
Jimmy: IT'S HEARTBREAKING BUT IT'S ALSO, IT MAKES YOU JUST BELIEVE AND HOPE. I JUST -- EXPLAIN THE STORY. IT'S ALMOST --
SO "MIRACLES FROM HEAVEN" IS BASED ON CHRISTY BEAM'S MEMOIR "MIRACLES FROM HEAVEN." AND SHE TELLS THE STORY OF HER FAMILY'S JOURNEY AS HER DAUGHTER IS INEXPLICABLY BECOMES MORE AND MORE SICK AND SHE TRIES TO FIND THE RIGHT TREATMENT FOR HER. AND THEN OUT OF THE BLUE THERE IS A BIG MIRACLE AND SWEET ANNABEL IS, YOU KNOW, SPOILER ALERT, BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL KNOW THERE'S A HAPPY ENDING. SHE'S CURED.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S ALMOST, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S REAL.
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S REAL UNTIL YOU SIT WITH THE REAL LITTLE GIRL AND YOU SIT WITH CHRISTY AND ANNABEL AND THEIR FAMILY. AND YOU SEE HOW HONEST AND SINCERE AND WHAT GOOD AMERICANS, WHAT AN AMAZING AMERICAN FAMILY THEY ARE. AND IT JUST MAKES YOU REALIZE, OH, THEY'RE NOT MESSING AROUND. THIS REALLY HAPPENED TO THEM.
