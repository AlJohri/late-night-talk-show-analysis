THANK YOU, GUYS, SO MUCH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] 2017 IS THE YEAR OF THE PLAN B. AND I FOUND MY PLAN B. I DID SEARCHING AND I'VE REALIZED THAT I COULD BE A A YOUTH PASTOR. REALLY. AT ANY CHURCH IN THE COUNTRY. CHRISTIAN, NON-DENOMINATIONAL, METHODIST, LUTHERAN, DOESN'T MATTER. THEY WOULD HIRE ME BASED ON MY BEARD ALONE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HERE'S HOW I KNOW I COULD DO IT. I WAS DOING SOME RESEARCH AND I REALIZED THAT THE MOST POPULAR PASTOR HAS GOT TONS OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND I WATCHED ONE OF THEM -- HAS MILLIONS OF VIEWS, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE. AND HERE'S HOW HE STARTED OFF HIS SERMON. I'LL NEVER FORGET WHEN I WAS 5 YEARS OLD AND I GOT AT LOST AT THE GROCERY STORE. HAVE YOU EVER FELT LOST? PAUSE. I CAN DO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN TAKE AN INSIGNIFICANT FALSE MEMORY AND RELATE IT TO PEOPLE THAT ARE DEALING WITH DEEP SPIRITUAL ISSUES. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT A PROBLEM. GET HIRED AT A CHURCH, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIRE TWO GUYS BUT I'M IN. JUST BASED ON HOW COOL I LOOK. AND THEN I'VE GOT TO GET MY FIRST SERMON TOGETHER. AND THEY'RE GOING TO START ME OFF WITH THE KIDS, WHICH IS FINE. I'M WOKE. I'M GOOD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SUNDAY ROLLS AROUND. OH, I'M EXCITED. I STROLL IN. THEY'RE FINISHING UP SOME WORSHIP SONGS. SOMETHING CREEPY, LIKE "NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS." SOMETHING LIKE THAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND ALL OF THE KIDS ARE LIKE, "WHO'S THAT GUY?" AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WHO?" AND THEY'RE LIKE, "THE GUY IN THE IN THE CORNER WITH THE SUNGLASSES ON." AND I'M LIKE, "ACTUALLY, THEY'RE TRANSITIONS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GIVE THEM ABOUT 15 MINUTES." [ LAUGHTER ] THEY FINISH UP THE SONG. I WALK UP ON STAGE. THERE'S SOME GUY WITH AN ACOUSTIC GUITAR. I'M LIKE, "HEY, GIVE IT TO ME." YOU KNOW? WHY NOT. JESUS OVER MUSIC IS ALWAYS BETTER, I BELIEVE. ♪♪ HEY, GUYS. I'M PASTOR NICK. I KNOW YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO PASTOR JEFF? WHERE'S PASTOR BRIAN? WHICH STATISTICALLY ARE THEIR NAMES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM. ♪♪ LET'S PRAY. BOW YOUR HEADS. TAKE OFF YOUR GLASSES. JESUS WAS A STICKLER. DEAR JESUS, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THESE NOODLES. RAMEN. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M JUST KIDDING, GUYS. I LOVE RAMEN. LET'S MAKE A POUR OVER AND HANG OUT. HUH? I'M PASTOR NICK. I'M A COOL DUDE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OH, JESUS. ♪♪ YOU SON OF A GOD. [ LAUGHTER ] RASCAL. OPEN UP YOUR BIBLES. AND THEN CLOSE THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, I'M A COOL PASTOR. OPEN UP YOUR iPHONES. WHAT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHAT? OPEN UP GOOGLE MAPS! BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING, GOOGLE CREATED EARTH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] JUST KIDDING. THAT'S A PASTOR NICK JOKE. I'M PASTOR NICK, ACTUALLY. OPEN UP GOOGLE MAPS AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS HIT A LITTLE TRANSLUCENT COMPASS IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT-HAND CORNER. JUST TAP ON IT. AND WHAT THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU IS YOUR CURRENT LOCATION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT JESUS CHRIST, YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR, IS IN ALL OF OUR CURRENT LOCATIONS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NEVER HEARD IT PUT THAT WAY! AND I KNOW TRENT'S IN THE BACK. HE HAS A SMARTPHONE. NO, HE DOESN'T. HE'S GOT NO SERVICE. TRENT, YOU'RE GOING TO HELL! [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ BUT, SERIOUSLY, I'LL NEVER FORGET, WHEN I WAS 2 YEARS OLD, AND I WAS PLAYING WITH A TOY. IT WAS A FIRE TRUCK. AND I DROPPED THAT FIRE TRUCK ON MY BIG TOE. AND LATER THAT DAY THE TOENAIL CAME OFF. HAVE YOU LOST A LOVED ONE? [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU. I'M PASTOR NICK. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
