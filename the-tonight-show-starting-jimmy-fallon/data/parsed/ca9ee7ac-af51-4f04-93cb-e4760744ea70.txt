[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHILE I WAS ON THE GONE WITH PUTIN NEGOTIATING A CEASE FIRE IN UKRAINE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IF HE'S GONNA DO MY JOB -- RUINED MY WHOLE WEEKEND. OBAMA ACTUALLY HAD SOME PRETTY FUNNY LINES AT THE DINNER BUT SINCE HE'S NOT A TRAINED COMEDIAN, I THINK HE WAS CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T KNOW WHEN THE LAUGH. SO HE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TECHNIQUE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE NEW WHEN WE GOT TO THE PUNCHLINE. TAKE A LOOK.
IN 2008 MY SLOGAN WAS YES WE CAN. IN MY 2013 MY SLOGAN WAS CONTROL ALT DELETE. [ HONK ] [ LAUGHTER ] I REMEMBER WHEN A SUPER PACT WAS JUST ME BUYING MARLBORO 100S INSTEAD OF REGULARS.
