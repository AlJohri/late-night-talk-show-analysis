Jimmy: HELLO, EVERYBODY! HI, EVERYBODY! WELCOME! THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE! HOT CROWD TONIGHT! HOT NEW YORK CITY CROWD TONIGHT HERE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE AT THE "TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, YOU'RE HERE, YOU MADE IT. YOU GUYS, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GETTING READY TO SPEAK TO CONGRESS NEXT TUESDAY. AND APPARENTLY THIS SPEECH WILL BE MORE UPBEAT THAN THE ONE HE GAVE AT HIS INAUGURATION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE WERE LIKE, "SERIOUSLY, 'MANCHESTER BY THE SEA' WAS MORE UPBEAT THAN HIS INAUGURATION SPEECH." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO THAT'S -- I'VE HEARD THAT TRUMP'S FREQUENT VISITS TO HIS MAR-A-LAGO RESORT HAVE MANY WONDERING IF HE'LL STICK WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL TRADITION OF VISITING CAMP DAVID. WHILE OTHERS WOULD JUST BE HAPPY IF HE STUCK WITH THE TRADITION OF VISITING THE WHITE HOUSE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE STILL PRESIDENT ON THE WEEKENDS, YOU KNOW THAT? ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
Jimmy: OF COURSE ANOTHER BIG STORY OF TRUMP'S ONGOING FEUD WITH THE MEDIA. ESPECIALLY HIS TWEET WHERE HE CALLED THE PRESS "THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAID, "NO, THAT WOULD SKILL BE KALE. WE DON'T LIKE -- NO ONE LIKES KALE." [ APPLAUSE ] "HAVE YOU TRIED BAKING IT WITH A LITTLE OLIVE OIL?" "YEAH, I'VE TRIED THAT TOO AND I DON'T --" "IT TASTES LIKE POTATO CHIPS." "NO, IT DOESN'T. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TASTES LIKE KALE." "YOU PUT SOME SALT --" "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH." "FAKE CHEESE STUFF." "YEAH I KNOW IT TASTES GROSS." "HAVE YOU EVER HAD IT WITH A A DORITO? YOU CAN BARELY TASTE THE KALE." BUT GET THIS, SO FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LINCOLN CHAFFEE IS ACTUALLY SIDING WITH TRUMP SAYING HE CAN RELATE TO HOW TRUMP'S BEING COVERED. AND EVEN LINCOLN CHAFFEE WAS LIKE, "WAIT, WHO AM I AGAIN?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AM I THE GUY WITH THE GUITAR? NO, THAT WAS MARTIN O' MALLEY. NO, YEAH, I WAS THE GUY WITH THE HAIR, OKAY.

IT'S TURNING IT LESS INTO PICK A CARD, IM GOING TO DO A TRICK FOR YOU, AND HERE'S THIS ILLUSION, EVERYONE APPLAUDS, AND HE DOES IT AND HE'S SO GOOD. HE MAKES IT MORE OF A A CONVERSATION ABOUT CHOICES AND CHOICES THAT WE MAKE IN OUR LIVES AND ARE THINGS PREDETERMINED OR ARE THEY REAL.

OKAY, OKAY. TELL ME ABOUT THIS SPECIAL EPISODE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. THIS IS NEXT FRIDAY?
YES. THIS FRIDAY COMING UP.
Jimmy: THIS COMING FRIDAY.
YEAH, I ACTUALLY CO-WROTE THIS EPISODE. THIS MY MOST PERSONAL EPISODE EVER ON THE SHOW. MY -- IT'S INSPIRED BY MY REAL LIFE WIFE, TRAN, AND HER FIGHT AGAINST BREAST CANCER. SHE'S CANCER-FREE FOR EIGHT YEARS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH.
Jimmy: GOOD FOR HER. WOW.
YEAH. AND IT'S REALLY, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY MY MOST FAVORITE PERSONAL EPISODE. MY TV WIFE DISCOVERS A LUMP ON SELF-EXAM. AND IT -- BASICALLY KEN, MY CHARACTER GUIDES HER THROUGH IT. IT'S REALLY -- IT'S POSITIVE WITHOUT BEING PREACHY. THERE'S A LOT OF -- THERE'S A A LOT OF SHARP, EDGY JOKES UNDERNEATH IT. BECAUE WHILE AS TRAN AND I WERE GOING THROUGH THIS, WE WOULD USE A LOT OF DARK HUMOR TO GET THROUGH DARK TIMES. SO IT REALLY -- IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS I'VE DONE. I HOPE YOU GUYS ENJOY IT. IT REALLY IS -- IT'S FOR -- PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN IT ARE, LIKE, LOVE THE EPISODE BECAUSE IT'S BECOME SO UNIVERSAL AND WHAT BECAME AN INTIMATE STORY NOW IS REALLY A UNIVERSAL WORLD LOVE STORY. SO, I'M REALLY APPRECIATING BEING HERE. [ APPLAUSE ]

THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT MUST'VE BEEN TOUGH. I'M GLAD THEY DID THAT THOUGH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: A LOT OF PEOPLE -- IF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS. YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS. BUT DR. KEN, YOU ACTUALLY WERE A DOCTOR, OR ARE A DOCTOR DOCTOR.
YEAH, NOW IT'S TECHNICALLY I AM STILL A DOCTOR. AND EVEN WHEN I WOULD DO COMEDY ON THE SIDE. LIKE PATIENTS WOULD COME UP TO ME AND WHEN THEY FOUND OUT I DID COMEDY OR THEY SAW ME ON COMEDY CENTRAL, THEY WERE LIKE, "I'M SO HAPPY YOU HAVE AN OUTLET AS A DOCTOR," BECAUSE I WAS VERY SERIOUS -- I NEVER JOKED AROUND AT WORK. I MEAN, IT IS LIFE AND DEATH, IT'S MEDICINE SO I NEVER LET ON THAT I HAD ANY OTHER INTEREST. AND THAT'S TOTALLY TRUE. ASK ANY OF MY FORMER PATIENTS. THEY'D WOULD NEVER KNOW. AND SO WHEN THEY SAY YOU COULD -- I COULD NEVER ENVISION YOU DOING THIS. THAT'S A COMPLIMENT, AS OPPOSED TO -- I MEAN, IF YOU REALLY -- IF A PATIENT CAME FOR ME AND SAID, "DUDE, I KNEW YOU'D BE HUGE, MAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EVER SINCE FROM THE MOMENT YOU CHECKED MY PROSTATE, I SAID THAT GUY'S HILARIOUS." [ LAUGHTER ] "SOME DAY'S HE GOING JUMP NAKED OUT OF TRUNK. YOU'LL SEE." [ LAUGHTER ]

I KNOW I'M NOT THE SHORTEST PERSON YOU EVER SEEN OR THE SKINNIEST, BUT I'M JUST LITTLE ENOUGH THAT IF I WAS YELLING AT MY GIRLFRIEND IN PUBLIC, IT WOULDN'T BOTHER ANYBODY. [ LAUGHTER ] USUALLY YOU SEE THAT YOU'RE LIKE, "HEY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?" PROBLEM HERE? YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT? BUT WITH ME YOU'D BE LIKE -- "OH. HE NEED A NAP. THAT'S WHAT THAT IS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IS IT JUST ME OR IS THE MARK OF A GOOD PARTY ALWAYS SOMETHING BAD HAPPENING? NO ONE IS EVER LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH, THAT WAS A GREAT PARTY LAST NIGHT! WE ALL DRANK JUST ENOUGH, GOT HOME SAFE AND WOKE UP IN TIME FOR BREAKFAST." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NEVER THE DESCRIPTION, EVER. IT'S ALWAYS LIKE GREAT PARTY. BILL DIED . GREAT PARTY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A FANTASTIC PARTY. SOMEBODY NEED CALL BILL'S MAMA. HE'S DEAD. I DON'T TALK TO BILL. I DON'T TALK TO BILL LIKE THAT, BUT GREAT PARTY. FIRST TIME I EVER WENT TO A A FRATERNITY PARTY, AND A GIRL TWERKED ON ME, I FELL DOWN BECAUSE I WASN'T READY. [ LAUGHTER ] GREAT PARTY THOUGH. I ACTUALLY GOT TO DO THIS SHOW WITH THESE OTHER COMICS. THEE LIKED ME A LOT SO THEY BROUGHT ME ALONG WITH THEM TO DO THE SHOW. WE WERE GOING TO PAID A TON OF MONEY, AND EACH GET A HOTEL ROOM. IT WAS GOING TO BE THE BEST THING TO EVER HAPPEN TO ME. WE GET THERE, THERE WAS A A TERRIBLE MISCOMMUNICATION WITH THE BOOKER. WE DON'T HAVE FOUR HOTEL ROOMS. WE HAVE ONE HOTEL ROOM WITH ONE BED, AND WE ALL JUST GOT IN IT LIKE IT MADE SENSE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW IT IS ME AND THREE OF THE BIGGEST DUDES IN THE WORLD IN ONE BED. AND I KNEW THEM SO I KNEW I DIDN'T WANT TO SLEEP WITH THEM BECAUSE I KNEW WE ALL HAD SLEEP DISORDERS. I HAD INSOMNIA. I WAS UP ALL NIGHT. THE MAN WHO SLEPT RIGHT HERE HAD SLEEP APNEA. THIS MAN DIED THREE TIMES THAT NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] MAN IN THE MIDDLE IS 6'8", 280-POUND BLACK MAN. THIS IS HOW HE SNORED ALL NIGHT, NON-STOP, WHOLE NIGHT. [ SNORING ] [ MOAN ] THE ENTIRE NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] TERRIFIC. MAN AT THE END RIGHT HERE HAS NIGHT TERRORS. HE'S A SCREAMER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S SCARED OF BECAUSE HE'S BIGGER THAN EVERYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HE SCREAMED SO HARD AND SO LOUD, HE WOKE UP PEOPLE THE NEXT HOTEL ROOM OVER, BUT NOT HIMSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] SO ALL NIGHT ALL YOU HEAR WAS THIS DUDE RIGHT HERE MAKING NOISE, THIS DUDE RIGHT HERE MOANING, THIS DUDE RIGHT HERE SCREAMING, AND ME LAYING HORIZONTAL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BED LIKE A DOG. [ LAUGHTER ] SO ALL I HEAR ALL NIGHT, ALL I HEAR THE ENTIRE NIGHT WAS -- ♪♪ ♪ YEAH ♪ ♪♪ ♪ YEAH ♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS TERRIBLE.

AND IN MY DEFENSE, I WAS LOSING A FIGHT TO A CEILING FAN. OKAY? LET ME EXPLAIN. BECAUSE WE BEEN TO THE MOON. WE USE LITTLE PIECES OF GLASS TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD. WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE SELF-DRIVING CARS BUT THERE IS STILL NO CLEAR INDICATION WHEN TO STOP PULLING THE DRAWSTRING ON THE CEILING FAN, OKAY. NOW I'M CHILLY. I WAS WARM BEFORE, NOW I'M CHILLY. I'D LIKE THE CEILING FAN TO STOP BECAUSE I'M CHILLY. OKAY? AND IT'S JUST GOING -- [ FAN SPINNING ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
