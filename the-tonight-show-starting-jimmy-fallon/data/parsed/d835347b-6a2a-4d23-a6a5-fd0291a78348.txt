Jimmy: WELCOME! OH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HEY. HOT CROWD! OH, I CAN FEEL IT! HOT CROWD TONIGHT. WELCOME, EVERYONE, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WELL, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE YOU GUYS, I SAW THAT THERE ARE NOW LESS THAN 100 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. [ LAUGHTER ] OR YOU CAN SAY THERE ARE NOW LESS THAN 100 DAYS LEFT, PERIOD. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, IT DEPENDS HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. [ APPLAUSE ] NOW THAT THE CONVENTIONS ARE OVER, THINGS ARE STARTING TO HEAT UP HERE. I SAW THAT APPLE CEO TIM COOK WILL HOLD A FUNDRAISER LATER THIS MONTH FOR HILLARY CLINTON. HE HAD A LONG LIST OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE EVENT, BUT HILLARY JUST SAID "AGREE" WITHOUT REALLY READING THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] LEARN A LESSON, I MEAN, COME ON. AND DONALD TRUMP IS ALSO OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING. HE WAS ACTUALLY IN COLORADO RECENTLY, WHERE HE POSED FOR A A PICTURE WHILE HE WAS HOLDING TWO BABIES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ONE OF THEM DIDN'T SEEM TOO HAPPY. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. YEAH, THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S TRUMP IN THE MIDDLE, BY THE WAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HIM IN THE MIDDLE. IN RELATED NEWS, TRUMP'S ALREADY GIVEN THAT BABY A MEAN NICKNAME. HE'S LIKE, "CRY BABY BILLY ALREADY HAS A DIRTY DIAPER, SAD. [ APPLAUSE ] HE'S GOTTA CONTROL HIMSELF." YESTERDAY, TRUMP SAT DOWN FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, WHERE HE COMPARED HIS OWN CAMPAIGN WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HE GOT HIS FACTS A LITTLE MIXED UP. CHECK THIS OUT.
I HONESTLY BELIEVE IF SHE TOLD THE TRUTH -- 'CAUSE SHE MADE SOME REFERENCE TO MY CAMPAIGNING -- I'VE HAD A A BEAUTIFUL -- I'VE HAD A A FLAWLESS CAMPAIGN. YOU'LL BE WRITING BOOKS ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, AND YET SHE'S CRITICIZING MY CAMPAIGN. NOW HER CAMPAIGN, SHE COULDN'T BEAT BERNIE.
WELL, SHE DID BEAT HIM.
WELL, BARELY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: BARELY. [ LAUGHTER ] WOW. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE 1% WOULD BE STANDING UP FOR BERNIE SANDERS, YOU KNOW? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DURING THE SAME INTERVIEW, TRUMP ALSO WENT AFTER MICHAEL BLOOMBERG FOR ENDORSING HILLARY. IT GOT PRETTY PERSONAL AT THE END. WATCH THIS.
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG'S WANTED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT FOR PROBABLY AS LONG AS YOU'VE KNOWN HIM, AND GUESS WHAT? HE NEVER HAD THE GUTS TO DO IT, AND NOW I SEE THIS GUY UP ON STAGE SAYING NEGATIVE THINGS. HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ME. HE'S NEVER BEEN TO MY OFFICE. I DON'T KNOW HIM WELL.
YOU PLAYED GOLF TOGETHER.
MAYBE ONCE. [ LAUGHTER ]

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE, THEY'RE GOING TO STAY ABOARD A A CRUISE SHIP CALLED THE GETAWAY, WHICH WILL ACT AS -- IT'S LIKE A FLOATING HOTEL. YEAH. 'CAUSE NOTHING MAKES YOU FEEL SAFER ABOUT THE OLYMPICS THAN THE ORGANIZERS STAYING IN A A GETAWAY BOAT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] "YOU GUYS HAVING FUN OVER THERE? IT LOOKS REALLY FUN. KEEP THE ENGINES RUNNING!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS ISN'T GOOD HERE. THE MISS TEEN USA PAGEANT IS COMING UNDER FIRE FOR ITS LACK OF DIVERSITY AFTER ALL FIVE FINALISTS LOOKED VERY SIMILAR WITH BLUE EYES AND BLONDE HAIR. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EVEN THEIR PARENTS WERE LIKE, "WHICH ONE'S OURS?" [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] COME HERE, HONEY. AND THIS IS JUST CRAZY. I SAW THAT A SKYDIVER IN CALIFORNIA JUST BECAME THE FIRST PERSON TO JUMP OUT OF A A PLANE FROM 25,000 FEET WITHOUT A PARACHUTE AND LAND IN A NET. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] OR AS SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CALLS THAT, BUSINESS CLASS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] COME BACK! AIM FOR THE BULL'S-EYE! GUYS, THIS IS VERY INTERESTING HERE.
