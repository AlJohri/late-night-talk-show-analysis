WELL, HE'S GOT A VERY -- YOU KNOW, HE'S OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT MINDS.
Jimmy: HAS HE MURDERED -- HAS HE MURDERED ANYONE YET? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
HE'S -- IT'S FUNNY. HE'S TAKING -- I MET HIM MANY, MANY YEARS AGO. WE WERE DOING THIS SHOW, "LOST" AND DAMON LINDELOF AND CARLTON CUSE AND I WENT TO MAINE TO HAVE A MEETING WITH HIM FOR THIS MAGAZINE.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
WELL, THEY INTERVIEWED HIM -- WE ALL SURVIVED. WE ALL LIVED.
Jimmy: I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE --
NO, IT WAS GOOD. THEY INTERVIEWED HIM AND HE INTERVIEWED US SO THIS MAGAZINE WAS ALL GOOD.
Jimmy: BEHIND GLASS? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
NO, NO, IT WAS IN THE SAME ROOM. AND BY THE END OF THE INTERVIEW HE SAID, "YOU GUYS WANT TO GO SEE A MOVIE?" WE'RE LIKE, "SURE." SO I TOLD THIS STORY BEFORE. BUT WE GO TO SEE A MOVIE AND IT WAS HORROR MOVIE.
Jimmy: YEAH, A FILM OF YOU GUYS GETTING CUT UP IN PIECES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
NO, NO, NO AND IT WAS, IT WAS CALLED "THE DESCENT," A A VERY SCARY, WELL-MADE MOVIE AND WE -- WE GO TO SEE THIS MOVIE AND I'M IN THIS THEATER IN MAINE WITH STEPHEN KING, SITTING NEXT TO STEPHEN KING, WATCHING A HORROR MOVIE, WHICH IS LIKE A DREAM IN LIFE, RIGHT? SO YOU'RE WATCHING -- AND EVERY TIME SOMEONE WAS REALLY HORRIBLY KILLED HE WOULD GO, "THAT'S AWESOME!" HE LIKE -- HE LOVED IT. HE WAS SO --
Jimmy: THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.
HE LOVED IT!
Jimmy: THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. HE'S ONE IN A MILLION, HE'S STEPHEN KING. I DON'T --
IT WAS EVERYTHING GOING TO A A HORROR MOVIE WITH STEPHEN KING SHOULD BE, IT WAS FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. SO, THAT'S GOING TO BE ON HULU, RIGHT? "CASTLE ROCK."
YES.
Jimmy: I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT. THEN YOU HAVE A LITTLE MOVIE COMING OUT DECEMBER 15th CALLED "STAR WARS 8." CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
IN FAIRNESS --
Jimmy: IN FAIRNESS --
THIS IS RYAN JOHNSON'S MOVIE.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT YOURS, NO.
I'M EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF THE MOVIE, KATHY KENNEDY AND RIAN JOHNSON BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I CANNOT WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO SEE.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND THEN WE HAVE ALSO "THE PLAY THAT GOES WRONG."
YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS A BIG DEAL. YOU'RE DOING A BROADWAY PLAY. THIS IS BIG TIME.
ISN'T THAT WEIRD?
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU FIND THESE GUYS? CAUSE I KNOW THEM, THEY'RE FROM ENGLAND.
THEY'RE FROM LONDON. WE WERE SHOOTING "THE FORCE AWAKENS." I, ONE NIGHT, HAD A NIGHT FREE, LOOKED TO SEE WHAT WAS PLAYING. SAW THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED, "A PLAY THAT GOES WRONG." BOUGHT A TICKET, WENT TO GO SEE IT.
Jimmy: BY YOURSELF?
SOLO. AND IT WAS -- I'D NEVER LAUGHED THAT HARD. AND THE AUDIENCE -- YOUNG PEOPLE, OLD PEOPLE, I'VE NEVER SEEN AN AUDIENCE LAUGH THAT HARD. AND I JUST COULDN'T -- IT WAS THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE. AND SO I ASKED THE PRODUCERS AFTERWARDS LIKE IF I CAN HELP AT ALL IN BRINGING THE SHOW TO BROADWAY, I WOULD LOVE TO, AND I PARTNERED UP WITH A VETERAN BROADWAY PRODUCER, KEVIN McCOLLUM AND HERE WE ARE.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND THESE GUYS ARE LIKE A A TROUPE. IT'S A WHOLE --
THEY'RE AMAZING. THEY'VE BECOME THIS PHENOMENON IN LONDON. THEY HAD THREE PLAYS PLAYING ON THE WEST END, WHICH IS LIKE BROADWAY OVER THERE AT THE SAME TIME.
Jimmy: YOU SAW THE ONE ABOUT THE BANK ROBBERY OR SOMETHING?
OH YEAH, A COMEDY ABOUT A A BANK ROBBERY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THEY'RE AMAZING.
Jimmy: I WAS CRYING. LIKE IT WAS THE MOST LIKE PHYSICAL STUFF, BUT KIND OF MONTY PYTHON-Y, VERY FUNNY, VERY --
IT IS SO MONTY PYTHON MEETS BUSTER KEATON AND IT'S SO SILLY BUT WHAT'S INCREDIBLE, THE MORE YOU GET TO SORT OF SEE HOW THEY WORK IS, THE INTRICACY AND THE THOUGHT AND THE SOPHISTICATION THAT GOES BEHIND IT. IT'S ALL ON THIS -- THEY'RE BRILLIANT AND THEY MAKE IT SEEM SO EFFORTLESS.
Jimmy: YEAH, THEY'RE -- IT'S "THE PLAY THAT GOES WRONG" AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY, YOU BROUGHT THE WRITERS OF THE PLAY WITH YOU TONIGHT.
I DID.
Jimmy: CAN WE BRING THEM OUT TO SAY HELLO?
OH, YEAH, OF COURSE. [ CHEERS ] THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS, BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE BEEN ON A, LIKE, BIG AMERICAN TALK SHOW. SO, IT'S A BIG DEAL FOR THEM.
