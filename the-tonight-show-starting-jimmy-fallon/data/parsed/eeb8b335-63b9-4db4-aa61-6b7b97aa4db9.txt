MORE TIME, OKAY.
Jimmy: JUST STARTED. YOU JUST STARTED. THE FIRST JOKE. [ LAUGHTER ]
UMM. HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING. TED TALKS TOO MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW ABOUT KEVIN TALKS, TED LISTENS FOR A CHANGE? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BETTER YET, HOW ABOUT TED SHUTS UP? BECAUSE REALLY, YOU LEARN WHEN YOU LISTEN. DON'T YOU? LISTENING AND READING IS VERY IMPORTANT. I WAS NEVER A BIG READER IN SCHOOL. MY TEACHERS ALWAYS SAY I WOULD RATHER PLAY AND HAVE FUN, GAMES, THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT NOW, I'M TELLING YOU, I'M SUCH A VERACIOUS READER. I LOVE TO READ, I'M READING ABOUT HISTORY. I'M READING ABOUT THE GREAT EXPLORER MARCO POLO! [ LAUGHTER ] AND, THE THING ABOUT MARCO POLO WAS HE WENT TO THE FAR EAST, AND HE BROUGHT BACK SPICES. AND THEN, MARCO POLO, POLO, HE WENT BACK AND BROUGHT BACK A A SPICE RACK AS WELL. SO, THIS GUY WAS AMAZING. NOW, THE THING ABOUT MARCO --
POLO.
RUBIO. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE THING ABOUT MARCO RUBIO IS HE IS NO MARCO POLO. POLO. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S WHAT IT IS. IN THE 13th CENTURY, SPICES WERE PROBABLY A GREAT GIFT. VERY UNIQUE. YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO FIND SOMETHING UNIQUE FOR SOMEBODY NOWADAYS. LAST YEAR, MY WIFE GAVE ME A A STAR AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO SWEET AND SO THOUGHTFUL. YOU KNOW, IT CAME WITH A A CERTIFICATE, A CHART TO SHOW YOU WHERE IT WAS IN THE SKY. THEY NAMED IT AFTER ME. WHICH WOULD BE GREAT. THEN IT DAWNED ON ME THAT MOST OF THE STARS WE SEE IN THE SKY DON'T EXIST ANYMORE. THEY BURNED OUT YEARS AGO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE'RE SEEING THE LIGHT COMING FROM LIGHT YEARS AWAY, AT US. SO BASICALLY, LAST YEAR MY WIFE GOT ME NOTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE MAY HAVE WELL HAVE GOTTEN ME A GIFT CARD FROM BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, YOU KNOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AMAZON SAYS IF I LIKE A STAR, WELL, I MIGHT ALSO LIKE AN ECHO FROM THE GRAND CANYON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? SHE'S ALWAYS COMING UP WITH STUFF. LAST YEAR, FOR MY BIRTHDAY PARTY, IT WAS A SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY. AND SHE TOTALLY FOOLED ME. I HAD NO IDEA. IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO COOL. THEN I STARTED THINKING, SHE WAS REALLY GOOD WITH KEEPING THAT A SECRET AND LYING. AND I THOUGHT, I MEAN, WHAT ELSE IS SHE LYING ABOUT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LAST WEEK, SHE SURPRISED ME AGAIN. SHE CAME HOME, SHE HAD HAIR EXTENSIONS. AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY FROM A A RUSSIAN PROSTITUTE. BUT SHE DIDN'T TELL ME THAT. I RECOGNIZED THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A 7-YEAR-OLD, AND I'M TELLING YOU, A 7-YEAR-OLD, THEY'RE THE BEST. PEOPLE SAY, WHAT DOES HE LIKE? WELL, HE LIKES TO GET DIZZY IS WHAT HE LIKES. WHICH I THINK IS A GATEWAY TO DRINKING, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. IT'S REALLY THE FIRST TIME YOU EXPERIENCE A HALLUCINATION AS A A KID. YOU KNOW, YOU START SPINNING AROUND AND STUFF. AND I DON'T CARE IF THAT'S ALL HE DOES. HE GOES OFF THE COLLEGE, THE OTHER KIDS ARE SMOKING POT, GETTING DRUNK. HE'S IN THE CORNER. GUYS, YOU MIND IF I MOVE THE COUCH TO GET DIZZY IN THE CORNER OVER HERE? [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT EXTRA HELMETS IF YOU WANT TO JOIN US. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE SPINNING, AND THERE WILL BE A POPCORN BOWL NEARBY, TOO. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO, I'M JUST SAYING. AND YOU KNOW, HE HAS THE CRAZIEST WAY OF REASONING. LIKE I WAS EXPLAINING BASEBALL TO HIM. HE GOES, "DADDY, AM I -- SO I'M SAFE ON FIRST BASE AS LONG AS MY HAND GETS THERE BEFORE THE BALL GETS THERE?" I SAID, "WELL, ACTUALLY, ANY PART OF YOUR BODY, AS LONG AS IT'S THERE BEFORE THE BALL GETS THERE, YOU'RE SAFE." AND HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, HE SAID, "WELL, WHAT IF I TOOK A A BIG POOP ON FIRST BASE AND IT WAS STILL ATTACHED TO MY BUTT?" [ LAUGHTER ] "WOULD I BE SAFE?" I THOUGHT, TECHNICALLY, YEAH, YEAH, YOU WOULD BE SAFE, BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO GET THERE VERY EARLY TO SET THAT UP. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HE DOES LIKE TO HAVE FUN. HE LOVES, HE LOVES PIZZA, COLD PIZZA. HE WANTS IT IN HIS LUNCH BOX EVERY DAY FOR SCHOOL. AND I KNOW THE TEACHERS ARE LOOKING IN THERE AND THEY'RE JUDGING. AND, SO WHAT WE DO IS WE'LL PUT AN APPLE IN THERE WITH SOME CARROTS, AS LIKE A BEARD FOR THE PIZZA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND HE NEVER TOUCHES THE APPLE OR THE CARROTS. WE'VE BEEN USING THE SAME APPLE AND CARROTS EVERY DAY FOR THE WHOLE YEAR. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT I'M SO TIRED, I'M JUST TIRED OF BEING JUDGED. I MEAN, EVERYTHING WE DO, WE'RE BEING JUDGED. EVEN LIKE WHEN WE SET UP A NEW WEBSITE, THEY GAUGE US ON THE STRENGTH OF OUR PASSWORD. WEAK! THAT'S WEAK. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT ONLY WEAK. IT'S SICKLY AND JAUNDICED. IT'S PRACTICALLY ON LIFE SUPPORT. I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE UP WALKING AROUND. YOU PROBABLY SLEEP WITH THE DOOR OPEN, DON'T YOU? YOU PROBABLY DON'T EVEN USE PROTECTION, DO YOU? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M SO SICK OF BEING JUDGED! ALL RIGHT, WELL THAT'S, I GOTTA GO, IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: NO, STAY. WE'RE GOING TO WAVE GOOD-BYE. DON'T LEAVE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE TALKING MORE WITH KEVIN NEALON WHEN WE COME BACK. STICK AROUND. YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

Jimmy: AND HOW DID YOU CELEBRATE?
WELL, WE GOT MARRIED ON THANKSGIVING. SO TEN YEARS AGO. SO THIS YEAR, WE WENT TO CHICAGO TO KIND OF GIVE BACK BECAUSE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT WE HAVE. AND WE WORKED IN A SOUP LINE BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE NEED HELP, TOO. YOU KNOW? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY DO. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: ACTUALLY YOU TOLD ME BACKSTAGE, YOUR WIFE GAVE YOU A A PRETTY AWESOME ANNIVERSARY PRESENT.
YES, SHE DID. MY WIFE IS PREGNANT WITH OUR SECOND CHILD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS FOR. KEVIN, WAIT A SECOND. THIS WHOLE THING -- NONE OF THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE TRUE, ARE THEY?
NO, JIMMY. [ LAUGHTER ] NO. I'M SORRY. I HAVE A -- I'M A PEOPLE PLEASER.
Jimmy: SURE.
AND WHEN I'M TRYING TO PLEASE THE AUDIENCE, I'M HURTING SOMEONE THAT'S CLOSEST TO ME, WHICH IS YOU. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. YOU KNOW, YOU HURT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE BY PLEASING TOTAL STRANGERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I GOT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. IT FEELS KIND OF PRETTY GOOD. WE ALL HAD A GOOD TIME FAKE THINKING THESE THINGS WERE TRUE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I STEERED YOU DOWN A WRONG STREET.
