Jimmy: HEY! IT'S SO GOOD. HEY. IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK, EVERYBODY! IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME, WELCOME. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. LAST NIGHT WAS THE LONG-AWAITED RETURN OF "THE WALKING DEAD." OR AS SOME PEOPLE CALL IT, THE 57th ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS. [ LAUGHTER ] AC/DC. ELO WAS THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] ONE OF THE BIG WINNERS LAST NIGHT WAS BECK, WHOSE ALBUM "MORNING PHASE" WON ALBUM OF THE YEAR. YEP. EVEN BECK WAS LIKE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS GOOD.
Steve: GOOD ALBUM.
Jimmy: EVEN BECK WAS LIKE, "I HAD AN ALBUM OUT LAST YEAR? I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW." [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, THERE WAS A LITTLE CONTROVERSY. DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS?
Steve: OOH.
Jimmy: A LITTLE TINY BIT OF CONTROVERSY. [ LAUGHTER ] OUR SHOW AIRS IN THE U.K., SO WE HAVE TO SAY CONTROVERSY. [ LAUGHTER ] A LITTLE CONTROVERSY AFTER BECK WON FOR "BEST ALBUM," KANYE WEST CRITICIZED THE GRAMMYS AND SAID THAT BECK SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS AWARD TO BEYONCE. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR REAL. HE REALLY SAID THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S BAD WHEN KIM IS THE ONE SAYING, "STOP TALKING." [ LAUGHTER ] "STOP IT." [ APPLAUSE ] "YOU'RE ANNOYING EVERYONE!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT BEYONCE DID WIN THE GRAMMY FOR "BEST R&B PERFORMANCE" FOR "DRUNK IN LOVE." THAT WAS GOOD FOR HER. THEN, SHE AND JAY-Z CELEBRATED BY GOING BACK TO THE HOTEL TO RELAX AND ORDER ROOM SERVICE FROM PHARRELL, APPARENTLY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CAN I SEE THAT PICTURE? THAT'S PHARRELL? [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK HE'S DRESSED MORE LIKE USHER. [ LAUGHTER ] AN USHER.
Steve: AN USHER.
Jimmy: YEAH. HERE'S YOUR SEAT, MA'AM. ENJOY THE MOVIE. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, PHARRELL WILLIAMS WON THE GRAMMY FOR "BEST MUSIC VIDEO" AND "BEST POP SOLO PERFORMANCE" FOR HIS SONG "HAPPY." WHEN ASKED -- YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHEN ASKED HOW HE FELT ABOUT THE WIN, HE WAS LIKE, "CONTENT." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M TIRED OF SAYING IT. I'M TIRED OF SAYING HAPPY. DID YOU SEE THIS? AC/DC RECEIVED SOME CRITICISM AFTER THEY USED A TELEPROMPTER FOR THEIR OWN SONG DURING THE OPENING OF THE GRAMMYS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THEY'RE GETTING OLD, BUT WHEN THEY SING "HIGHWAY TO HELL" THEY LEAVE THEIR RIGHT BLINKER ON THE WHOLE TIME. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IF YOU'RE ALL GOING TO HELL -- ARE YOU GOING TO GO IN THIS LANE OR NOT? WHY ARE THERE TWO LANES TO HELL? I DON'T KNOW.
Steve: A FAST LANE AND A A SLOW LANE.
Jimmy: THERE'S TWO LANES TO HELL. PEOPLE ARE COMING IN AND OUT OF HELL. MEATLOAF IS -- [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: HE'S COMING OUT OF HELL AND GOING INTO HELL. I DON'T KNOW.
Steve: HE CLOSED FOR THE GRAMMYS, RIGHT?

Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CHECK THIS OUT, GUYS. ACCORDING TO A RECENT SURVEY, 12% OF AMERICANS SAY THAT IT'S FINE TO CHEAT A LITTLE ON YOUR TAXES. WHILE THE OTHER 88% KNOW NOT TO TALK TO A GUY WITH A CLIPBOARD ASKING THEM IF THEY CHEAT ON THEIR TAXES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, I'VE BEEN STEALING MONEY FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS NOW. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? SHUT UP! [ LAUGHTER ] OH, THIS IS INTERESTING. A NEW STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT UTAH -- IS ANYONE HERE FROM UTAH? HEY, THERE YOU GO. WELL, A NEW STUDY SHOWS THAT UTAH HAS BEEN NAMED THE BEST STATE TO GROW OLD IN. WE ASKED SOME UTAH SENIOR CITIZENS WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. THEY PAINTED A PRETTY DIFFERENT PICTURE. HERE'S WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. FIRST WOMAN SAID, "THE SKIING, THE HIKING, THE MOUNTAIN BIKING, ALL THINGS I CAN'T DO." [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T DO ANY OF THOSE. THIS NEXT MAN SAID, "AS A GUY WITH A CIALIS PRESCRIPTION, THE IDEA OF MULTIPLE WIVES SOUNDS TERRIFYING."
Steve: WOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AND FINALLY THIS LAST MAN SAID, "MY FAVORITE THING TO DO IS GO WHITE WATER RAFTING. THAT'S WHEN I SIT IN MY TUB IN LUKEWARM WATER AND SPLASH AROUND TILL THE NURSE TELLS ME MY SOUP IS READY."

I DID. I SAW YOU.
Jimmy: YEAH. WHY ARE YOU SAYING IT LIKE THAT FOR?
WELL, BECAUSE JIMMY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIS HANDS. HE WAS ALL LIKE -- AND THEN HE'D JUST PUT THEM RIGHT DOWN BY HIS SIDE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT TRUE. I WAS JUST REALLY EXCITED FOR DEREK --
YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN THEY WERE THROWING THE PITCHES, YOU GOT EXCITED AND THEN YOU WERE LIKE, "NO, NO, NO, NO. CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WAS NERVOUS FOR HIM. AND I'M LIKE, I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GET UP AGAIN. BECAUSE HE ALREADY DID HIS LAST ONE. IT WAS GREAT. AND I JUST LOVE HIM. HE'S THE BEST. AND THEN HE HAD LIKE THE LAST ONE. IT WAS LIKE TWO OUTS. THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST INTENSE. I WAS JUST NERVOUS FOR HIM.
YOU LOOKED QUITE NERVOUS.
Jimmy: WE HAVE A CLIP. I DIDN'T LOOK THAT NERVOUS. I WASN'T CLAPPING LIKE THAT. THERE'S ME THERE. YEP. THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT NOW.
Jimmy: OKAY. WHATEVER. BIG DEAL, BIG DEAL. BIG DEAL! ALL RIGHT! STOP CLAPPING. YEAH. WE SAW ENOUGH OF THAT. ANYWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO AT THE GAME. I WAS REALLY EXCITED FOR HIM.
AWW.
Jimmy: NOW, I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE CRAZIEST THING EVER, THE WAY THEY DO THIS. YOU JUST DO A PHOTO SHOOT, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THEY DON'T TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE COVER?
NO. IT'S ALL A SURPRISE.
Jimmy: SEE, I DIDN'T KNOW THIS.
SO, I SHOT IN TENNESSEE ON A A FARM. SO, I MEAN, I WASN'T SHOOTING ON A BEACH. I HAD NO IDEA.
Jimmy: USUALLY, THEY'RE ALWAYS ON THE BEACH ON THE COVERS. AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, GREAT, I'M NOT GOING TO GET --"
YOU'RE WET AND YOU'RE LIKE COMING OUT OF THE WATER. AND NO. I WAS SHOOTING ON A FARM. I JUST JUMPED OFF A HORSE. I WAS SHOOTING ON A HORSE FOR THREE HOURS. IT WAS THE LAST SHOT OF THE DAY.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH. I WAS DRENCHED IN SWEAT. THEY BROUGHT ME IN THE CAR, PUT THE AIR-CONDITIONING ON, KIND OF ZHUZHED ME UP. AND I WAS LIKE, "CRAP, MAN."
Jimmy: LIKE, "I'M NOT GOING TO BE ON THE COVER THIS YEAR."
BECAUSE THEY SAID, "THIS IS YOUR COVER TRY." AND I GO, "NO, REALLY?"
Jimmy: BUT THEY TELL EVERY GIRL? THEY TELL EVERY GIRL OR EVERY MODEL?
MOST GIRLS GET A COVER TRY. BUT, I MEAN, I'VE HAD COVER TRIES TWO YEARS BEFORE AND NOTHING HAPPENED.
Jimmy: SO, WHEN YOU GET THE THING AND YOU FINALLY SEE IT, DO YOU GO, "I DIDN'T GET IT." YOUR AGENT DOESN'T KNOW? NO ONE KNOWS?
NO ONE.
Jimmy: WOW. SO, IT'S A GENUINE SURPRISE?
OH, MY GOODNESS. YES. I FOUND OUT ON TUESDAY, AND THEN I FLEW RIGHT TO YOU.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
SO, THAT'S FUN.
Jimmy: AS EVERYONE DOES. FLY RIGHT TO UNCLE JIMMY.
YEAH, EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT NO, IT'S ALL GOING TO CHANGE. THIS IS A GIANT, GIANT THING FOR YOU. THIS IS HUGE. I'VE GOT TO SHOW THIS THING BECAUSE IT'S THE FUNNIEST THING EVER. YOUR MOM, YOU GOT TO CALL YOUR MOM AND TELL HER YOU MADE THE COVER. THAT'S A BIG DEAL. NO ONE KNOWS. SHE MUST BE NERVOUS FOR YOU. AND EVERYONE MUST BE SO EXCITED FOR YOU. AND BACK AT HOME. SO, HERE'S THE VIDEO. WE HAVE YOU. THIS IS YOU CALLING YOUR MOM AND SAYING, "HEY, I DID IT." HANNAH DAVIS.
I GOT THE COVER. ARE YOU THERE? SHE SAID SHE JUST WET HER PANTS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE LOVE YOUR MOM. ONLY MOMS CAN SAY THAT. I JUST WET MY PANTS.
I KNOW. SHE IS SO SWEET. SHE ASKED IF SHE COULD MAYBE SCORE A DEPENDS COMMERCIAL AFTER THAT.
Jimmy: YES! THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
SHE WAS LIKE MAYBE YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR AGENT AND SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO.
Jimmy: MOM, YOU SHOULD BE THE NEW SPOKESPERSON FOR DEPENDS. ABSOLUTELY, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
I'LL TRY TO HOOK YOU UP.
Jimmy: THAT IS SO GOOD. WE'RE SO HAPPY FOR YOU. COULDN'T HAPPEN TO A COOLER GIRL.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH, YOU'RE AWESOME. SAY HI TO DEREK FOR ME.
