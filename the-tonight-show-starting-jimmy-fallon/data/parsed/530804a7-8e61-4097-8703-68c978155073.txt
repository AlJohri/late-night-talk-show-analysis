Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- AZIZ ANSARI, CARLA GUGINO, COMEDIAN, JEFF DYE, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: AH! YEAH.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HI, GUYS. THANK YOU. ♪♪ ♪♪ COME ON! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW IT'S A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. OH, YEAH. WELCOME, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW"! THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELL, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE IT'S THE OLYMPICS. WE ARE NOW ONLY TWO DAYS FROM THE START OF THE RIO SUMMER OLYMPIC GAMES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHICH MEANS IN JUST TWO DAYS PEOPLE WILL GO FROM KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT THE OLYMPICS TO SAYING, HOW THE HELL DID HE MESS UP A ROUND OFF BACKHAND SPRING? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] HOW DO YOU KNOW? I ACTUALLY READ THAT A NORTH KOREAN GYMNAST MAY BE THE FIRST FEMALE GYMNAST EVER TO ATTEMPT AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT MOVE THAT INVOLVES A TRIPLE TWISTING VAULT. WHEN ASKED IF SHE'S DONE IT BEFORE SHE SAID, HOW DO YOU THINK I ESCAPED FROM NORTH KOREA? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU CAN TELL THIS GYMNAST REALLY IS FROM NORTH KOREA 'CAUSE SHE'S THE ONLY ATHLETE TO SHOW UP IN RIO AND GO, THIS IS NICE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND GET THIS, I SAW THAT THE SLOGAN FOR THE 2016 RIO OLYMPICS IS "LIVE YOUR PASSION." GOOD SLOGAN. IT'S NOT THE FIRST ONE THEY CAME UP WITH. THEY ALMOST WENT WITH "COME FOR THE COMPETITION, STAY BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN QUARANTINED." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND THAT'S NOT AS CATCHY.
Steve: NOT AS CATCHY.
Jimmy: NOT AS CATCHY AS THE OTHER ONE. YEAH, THE OTHER ONE'S --
Steve: THE OTHER ONE'S MORE --
Jimmy: THE OTHER ONE'S BETTER I THINK. I HEARD THAT U.S. SWIMMER RYAN LOCHTE ACTUALLY DYED HIS HAIR LIGHT BLUE FOR THE RIO SUMMER OLYMPICS. HE DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE. HE JUST TOOK A SHOWER IN RIO AND CAME OUT THAT WAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE. THE YOUNGEST ATHLETE COMPETING AT THE RIO OLYMPICS IS A A 13-YEAR-OLD SWIMMER REPRESENTING NEPAL. SHE'S THE ONLY OLYMPIAN WHOSE MOM STILL PUTS SUNSCREEN ON HER BEFORE SHE GETS IN THE POOL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LET ME DO YOUR FACE. THAT'S RIGHT, 13-YEAR-OLD SWIMMER FROM NEPAL IS THE YOUNGEST ATHLETE AT THE OLYMPICS. ALTHOUGH, THAT COULD CHANGE 'CAUSE NOT ALL THE CHINESE GYMNASTS HAVE BEEN BORN YET. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE THE OTHER BIG COMPETITION GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS "BACHELOR IN PARADISE." WHICH PREMIERES -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE IT. I DON'T KNOW WHY. I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT. IT PREMIERED LAST NIGHT ON ABC. AND ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS IS THIS GUY DANIEL WHO WAS JUST ON THE LAST SEASON OF "THE BACHELORETTE." HE WASN'T THE MOST ELOQUENT PERSON IN THE WORLD, BUT LET'S SEE IF HE'S DOING ANY BETTER ON THIS SHOW.
CAN'T GET RID OF ME. I'M LIKE A DISEASE THAT JUST WON'T GO AWAY, YOU KNOW, LIKE HERPES OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HERPES, BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S TREATABLE NOWADAYS SO IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: WHAT IS GOING ON? IN FAIRNESS, THE NAME OF THAT SHOW PROBABLY SHOULD BE "HERPES IN PARADISE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHO AM I TO SAY? BUT THINGS SEEM LIKE THEY MIGHT BE GOING A LITTLE BETTER FOR DANIEL ONCE HE ACTUALLY MET SOME OF THE WOMEN STAYING IN THE HOUSE. CHECK IT OUT.
I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE LIKE A GOOD TALK AND LIKE SEE WHERE IT GOES.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I AM 25.
27. 23.
25.
21. NO, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE 21.
I AM 25.
21?
YEP.
Jimmy: 21? 23? 21? HAVE I SAID "HERPES" YET? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS ONE GUY WHO IS NEVER AT A A LOSS FOR WORDS AND THAT IS DONALD TRUMP. IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS FIGHTING WITH EVERYONE THIS WEEK. ON MONDAY TRUMP TOOK A SHOT AT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" SAYING QUOTE, "THEY DON'T WRITE GOOD." [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN TOLD THAT WAS GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT, TRUMP SAID, "EXCUSE ME. THEY DON'T WRITE GOODLY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BETTER. BETTER. HERE'S A LITTLE HEALTH NEWS. I READ THAT RESEARCH FROM THE PAST DECADE SHOWS THERE'S VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT FLOSSING IS EFFECTIVE. WHEN THEY HEARD THAT, MOST AMERICANS WERE LIKE, "OH, GOOD, NOW I CAN FINALLY STOP FLOSSING." I FLOSS ALL THE TIME. FINALLY, I THOUGHT THIS WAS PRETTY INCREDIBLE. APPARENTLY A ZAPPOS EMPLOYEE RECENTLY SET THE RECORD FOR THE COMPANY'S LONGEST CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL WHICH LASTED FOR 10 HOURS AND 43 MINUTES. THE EMPLOYEE'S NAME WAS STEVEN WEINSTEIN AND HE SAID THAT HE FELT AN INSTANT CONNECTION WITH THE FEMALE CUSTOMER. WELL, THEY STILL NEVER MET IN PERSON UNTIL TODAY. THAT'S RIGHT. WE FLEW THEM BOTH TO NEW YORK TO MEET EACH OTHER AND WE FILMED THE ENTIRE THING. IT WAS JUST AMAZING. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED.
I'M EXCITED. I AM NERVOUS. I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS CRAZY. ♪ THERE'S NO LOVE LIKE YOUR LOVE AND NO OTHER COULD GIVE MORE LOVE ♪
HERE ARE YOUR SHOES.
THANKS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: BEAUTIFUL. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

HE'S VERY FUNNY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] VERY FUNNY HUMAN. GUYS, ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT THE INTERNET IS GOING ON YOUTUBE AND DISCOVERING SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW, SOMETHING I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THERE'S SO MUCH CREATIVITY OUT THERE. THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO FIND A A WAY TO SHOWCASE SOME OF THE BEST VIDEOS MADE BY PEOPLE WE THINK THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. SO, TONIGHT WE HAVE A VIDEO FROM YOUTUBE CHANNEL CALLED "YOU SUCK AT COOKING." [ LAUGHTER ] HAVE YOU SEEN THEM YET? IT'S AN INSTRUCTIONAL COOKING VIDEO. THEY'RE REALLY FUNNY. NOW WE THINK IT'S REALLY FUNNY. SO PLEASE ENJOY THE WORLD PREMIERE OF "10 MORE WAYS TO CHOP AN ONION." IN THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF, "TONIGHT SHOW YOUTUBE PREMIERE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ TONIGHT SHOW YOUTUBE PREMIERE ♪ ♪ YOU SUCK AT COOKING YEAH YOU TOTALLY SUCK ♪
THE FIRST METHOD INVOLVES HITTING YOUR ONION FIRMLY WITH YOUR KNIFE AROUND THE OUTSIDE TO LOOSEN UP THE INSIDES. THEN SLICE IT OPEN. IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT'LL GET YOU MOST OF THE WAY THERE. IF YOU HAVE A BALSA WOOD CUTTING BOARD, IT'S NOT VERY DENSE SO YOU CAN PLACE YOUR ONION UNDERNEATH IT THEN PUSH UNTIL IT COMES THROUGH. AND DON'T FORGET TO CLEAN UP THE ONION SKIN AFTER. IF YOU HAVE ANY PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING EXPERIENCE YOU CAN DROP A FLYING ELBOW FROM THE TOP ROPE. THIS METHOD IS CALLED THE EDWARD SCISSOR HANDS OR THE EDWARD KNIFE FINGERS. IT'S JUST LIKE PLAYING A PIANO, EXCEPT IT SOUNDS BETTER THAN WHEN YOU PLAY PIANO. YOU CAN ALSO DO THE WOLVERINE. YOU CAN HACK THE ONION APART. YOU JUST NEED A COMPUTER, A A STANDARD RCA CABLE, BYPASS THE MAIN FRAME AND --
ACCESS GRANTED.
YOU CAN SNEAK UP BEHIND HIM IT AND SCARE IT. ROAR! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S OKAY. IT'S JUST ME. ♪ YOU SUCK AT COOKING OH, MY GOSH YOU SUCK ♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: PULLED ONE OUT OF HIS POCKET.
YEAH, THEN TRUMP IS LIKE, WHY DOESN'T YOUR WIFE SAY ANYTHING? THEN THE GUY GOES, YOU HAVE A A BLACK SOUL. WHICH IS THE COLDEST [ BLEEP ] I'VE EVER HEARD.

I FOUND OUT THAT I HAVE DYSLEXIA BACK IN 2031. [ LAUGHTER ] COOL. [ APPLAUSE ] SO I'M DUMB, BUT I AM VERY HAPPY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE THE HAPPIEST GUY I KNOW. AND I'M PROBABLY HAPPY BECAUSE I'M DUMB. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT EVERY SMART PERSON I'VE EVER MET SEEMS TO BE TICKED OFF ALL THE TIME. EVERY SMART PERSON I KNOW SEEMS TO BE VERY ANNOYED AND BOTHERED. THEY THINK EVERYTHING'S A A NUISANCE. THEY DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ANYTHING. I'M STARTING TO THINK DUMB IS GOODER. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK WHAT IT IS, IS SMART PEOPLE, THEY PUT ALL THIS LEARNING INTO THEIR BRAIN AND THEN THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. SO IT FRUSTRATES THEM. SO THEY JUST WALK AROUND GRUMPY ALL DAY. LIKE, GLOBAL WARMING AND GLUTEN AND -- [ LAUGHTER ] OTHER SMART STUFF. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT. [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW I DON'T STRUGGLE WITH THAT AT ALL. I'M USUALLY PICTURING ANIMALS WEARING CLOTHES. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST HAPPY. MY FRIENDS ARE LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING ABOUT, JEFF? I WAS LIKE, OH DOGS DON'T WEAR RAIN BOOTS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M DUMB BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE DUMB. THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MY DAD CAME WITH MY MOM AND HE WAS LIKE, WE SHOULD HAVE BABIES AND MY MOM WAS LIKE, BABY, OKAY. AND THEN I CAME OUT, LIKE, I'M BABY. [ LAUGHTER ] AT LEAST THAT'S HOW THEY EXPLAINED IT TO ME. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S NOT A LONG TALE. MY DAD'S ACTUALLY SO DUMB HE REPLIES TO JUNK MAIL. [ LAUGHTER ] I WISH THAT WAS A JOKE, THAT'S NOT A JOKE. WE CAUGHT HIM REPLYING TO JUNK MAIL. WE SAT HIM DOWN, WE'RE LIKE DAD, YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPLY TO THIS. IT'S CALLED SPAM MAIL, IT GOES TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, IT'S SENT BY ROBOTS, IT'S NOT JUST FOR YOU. HE'S LIKE, "OH I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE." [ LAUGHTER ] DEAR BARNES & NOBLE, THIS LOOKS LIKE A GREAT SALE, BUT I'LL BE OUT OF TOWN ON THE 23RD. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE AN IDIOT. ON CHRISTMAS, HE REFERENCED TO US THAT HE HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT. WE WERE LIKE, PAUSE CHRISTMAS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SHOW US IMMEDIATELY. AND HE WALKS US OVER TO THE COMPUTER AND SURE ENOUGH, MY DAD'S BEEN TWEETING EVERY DAY TEN TIMES A DAY FOR THE LAST YEAR. RIGHT? WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW THIS? BECAUSE HE DOESN'T FOLLOW ANYONE AND NO ONE FOLLOWS HIM. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S JUST BEEN SHOOTING THIS STUFF INTO SPACE, LIKE DAD, YOU DON'T HAVE A TWITTER, YOU HAVE A DIARY. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S JUST A RECORD OF YOUR WHEREABOUTS, DING-DONG. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MY MOM AND DAD ARE PRETTY MAD AT ME TOO THAT I'M THIS AGE AND I'M NOT MARRIED YET. BUT I THINK I'D BE GOOD AT GETTING MARRIED. AND I CAN WATCH NETFLIX AND NOT HAVE SEX. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HECK, I'M ALREADY DOING IT. YOU KNOW? PRACTICE. YOU KNOW? I WENT TO A WEDDING RECENTLY. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY ANNOYING. BECAUSE THE GUY WHO TALKED AT THE WEDDING, THE GUY WHO HAS LIKE THIS SQUARE RIGHT HERE, HE WAS LIKE, KEPT REPEATING HIMSELF LIKE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HE WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO US THAT MARRIAGE IS TWO PEOPLE BECOMING ONE. BUT HE KEPT LIKE JUST WINGING IT. YOU KNOW LIKE HE WOULD SAY IT JUST SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. HE WAS LIKE, MARRIAGE IS TWO BODIES BECOMING ONE BODY. TWO HEARTS BECOMING ONE HEART. TWO SOULS BECOMING ONE. TWO HOUSEHOLDS BECOMING ONE HOUSEHOLD. TWO ENTERED INTO ONE PHYSICALLY AND SEXUALLY AND SPIRITUALLY AND LEGALLY. TWO WALKED INTO THIS CHURCH, NOW LEAVE AS ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE TWO SANDBOXES, WE POUR THE SAND INTO ONE SANDBOX. BECAUSE IT WAS TWO BOXES BUT NOW ONE SANDBOX WITH TWO STUPID CANDLES WE GO DOWN, WE LIGHT ONE. THEY BLOW IT OUT. BECAUSE THERE WAS TWO FLAMES, BUT NOW ONE. I GET IT! [ LAUGHTER ] I GET IT! TWO NOW ONE. WRAP IT UP! YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE GOT BRIDESMAIDS TO MEET CHURCHMAN, ALL RIGHT LET'S DO THIS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. I WILL SAY THAT THOUGH, IF YOU'RE MARRIED AND YOU NOW BELIEVE YOU'RE ONE, I THINK THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. I JUST DON'T NEED TO HEAR IT A A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS. AND I DO BELIEVE IF THINK YOU'RE NOW ONE, YOU SHOULD USE THAT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. NEXT TIME YOU GET INTO A FIGHT WITH YOUR SPOUSE, YOU CAN JUST LOOK THEM RIGHT IN THE EYES AND GO "LISTEN HONEY, I DON'T HATE YOUR MOM. WE HATE YOUR MOM." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ONE NOW. THESE ARE OUR THOUGHTS, OKAY. USE IT FOR EVERYTHING. I DIDN'T LOOK AT THAT LADY'S BUTT. WE LOOKED AT THAT LADY'S BUTT.
