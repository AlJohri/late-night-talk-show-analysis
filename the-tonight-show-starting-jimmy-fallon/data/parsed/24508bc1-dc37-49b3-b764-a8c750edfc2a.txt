Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! WELCOME! ♪♪ THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WELCOME, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT IS A HOT CROWD. THAT IS A GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOU GUYS, THIS SUNDAY IS THE NEW YORK CITY MARATHON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. RUNNERS TRAIN FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS JUST FOR THE CHANCE TO TELL THEIR FRIENDS THEY CAME IN 10,000th PLACE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S NICE. [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ] THE MARATHON'S OPENING CEREMONY ACTUALLY KICKED OFF TODAY WITH THE PARADE OF NATIONS. IT'S A CELEBRATION OF THE FACT THAT WHEREVER WE COME FROM AND WHATEVER OUR CULTURE, WE CAN ALL COME TOGETHER TO GET BEATEN BY A GUY FROM KENYA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND IT'S JUST -- IT'S A A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. BUT OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY IS ELECTION DAY IS ON TUESDAY. AND I READ THAT KRISPY KREME IS GIVING OUT FREE DONUTS TO ANYONE WHO SHOWS THEIR "I VOTED" STICKER. [ CHEERS ] THAT'S RIGHT. KRISPY KREME, SO THAT WAY YOU CAN MAKE TWO DECISIONS YOU'RE NOT REALLY PROUD OF. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YESTERDAY, BERNIE SANDERS MET UP WITH HILLARY CLINTON TO CAMPAIGN IN NORTH CAROLINA. [ CHEERS ] AS FORMER RIVALS, IT'S NICE TO SEE THEM COME TOGETHER AND EMBRACE EACH OTHER. TAKE A LOOK. OH. [ LAUGHTER ] ALMOST. THEY ALMOST EMBRACED EACH OTHER. "IT'S FLU SEASON. GET AWAY FROM ME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, MELANIA TRUMP GAVE A SPEECH YESTERDAY WHERE SHE SAID SHE WANTS TO FOCUS ON STOPPING INTERNET BULLIES. WHEN ASKED HOW SHE PLANS ON DOING THAT, SHE SAID, "BY HIDING MY HUSBAND'S PHONE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] STOP IT. NOW, MULTIPLE SOURCES WITHIN THE FBI SAY THE AGENCY HAS SO PRO-TRUMP, ONE AGENT EVEN CALLED THE FBI, "TRUMPLANDIA." THEN TRUMP SAID, "HEY, THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO RENAME THE UNITED STATES IF I WIN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "IT'S GOT A NICE RING TO IT." BUT IF YOU'RE VOTING HERE IN NEW YORK, YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THIS. I READ THAT BALLOT SELFIES ARE BANNED HERE IN NEW YORK CITY FOR ELECTION DAY. WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS ANTHONY WEINER WON'T BE VOTING THIS YEAR. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ELECTION WITH AN "L." ELECTION DAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: I JUST WANNA TAKE A A PICTURE THOUGH.

AND, THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY, BUT I SAW THAT WAY BACK IN 2000. THEY ONCE RELEASED A A LIMITED-EDITION TOY CALLED "FURBY FOR PRESIDENT." THIS IS REAL. IT LOOKS A LITTLE FAMILIAR. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THING. [ LAUGHTER ] ISN'T THAT AMAZING? THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT THING AND DONALD TRUMP IS THE FURBY HAS BATTERIES YOU CAN REMOVE TO GET IT TO STOP TALKING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU COULD -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'LL STOP. BE CAREFUL, THOUGH. IF YOU BRING THAT ONE HOME, IT WILL DEPORT YOUR OTHER TOYS. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST SO YOU KNOW. JUST SO YOU KNOW. [ APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF TOYS, THERE'S A NEW LINE OF CABBAGE PATCH KIDS THAT HAVE ELECTRONIC EYES THAT CAN ACTUALLY REACT TO YOU. PERFECT FOR KIDS THAT LOVE DOLLS, BUT HATE BEING ABLE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "MOM, IT WON'T STOP STARING AT ME." GUYS, SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S NOTHING BUT BAD NEWS OUT THERE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE ELECTION GOING ON. WELL, WE HERE AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW" HAVE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. WE ASKED REAL LOCAL NEWS ANCHORS FROM ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY TO READ STORIES THAT WE WISH WERE TRUE, STORIES THAT MAKE US FEEL HAPPY. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IN TONIGHT'S INSTALLMENT OF, "I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS AND GOOD NEWS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS ♪

BREAKING NEWS, THAT CRYING BABY ON YOUR CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT JUST STOPPED, LOOKED AROUND AND SAID, "WOW, THAT WAS PRETTY ANNOYING. SORRY, EVERYBODY." AND SLEPT PEACEFULLY FOR THE REST OF THE TRIP. [ LAUGHTER ]
HEY, REMEMBER EARLIER WHEN YOU TRIPPED, AND THEN YOU TRIED TO PLAY IT COOL BY TURNING IT INTO A LITTLE JOG? [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, IT WORKED. THAT'S RIGHT. A FEW PEOPLE SAW IT AND TOTALLY THOUGHT YOU JUST DECIDED TO JOG FOR A SECOND. [ LAUGHTER ]
BREAKING NEWS, YOUR COWORKERS ARE DYING TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR DREAM LAST NIGHT. IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT IT NEVER REALLY HAPPENED AND DOESN'T AFFECT THEM IN ANY WAY. THEY'RE JUST HAPPY TO BE TALKING TO YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
THIS JUST IN. YOUR FAVORITE SPORTS TEAM CAN NOW HEAR YOUR SUGGESTIONS THROUGH THE TELEVISION, AND THEY LOVE THE HELPFUL ADVICE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO, THE NEXT TIME YOU YELL, "HOW ABOUT PLAY SOME REAL DEFENSE?" YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE SOME REAL DEFENSE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

I WAS WORKING ON MUSIC TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO I AM AND HOW COULD PEOPLE STOP TELLING ME TO TRY TO FIT IN WITH EVERYBODY ELSE SINCE I WAS 14 YEARS OLD. I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. YOU WERE BORN TO SHOW PEOPLE WHAT LOVE SOUNDS LIKE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: COME ON! NO ONE'S BUYING THAT. I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GREAT, BECAUSE YOU SAY STUFF LIKE THAT AND YOU GO -- AND YOU FEEL EMOTION THROUGH THE TV SET AND I GO, "I WANT ALICIA KEYS TO PICK ME." [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. I CAN'T EVEN SING.
NO, THAT -- I MEAN, WEI IS LIKE AN INCREDIBLE VOCALIST AND TO HEAR HER, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SHE MAKES YOU FEEL AND SHE HAS THIS TINY, TINY, TINY LITTLE SPEAKING VOICE AND THEN HER ACTUAL SINGING VOICE IS HUGE. SO I HAVE TO SAY I WASN'T ALWAYS THAT GOOD LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? YOU COULDN'T --
IT WAS A VERY STRANGE SCENARIO BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU PRESS YOUR BUTTON AND IF OTHER PEOPLE PRESS THEIR BUTTON THEN EVERYONE HAS TO, LIKE, START TO PITCH TO THE PERSON WHY THEY SHOULD CHOOSE THEM, AND I DIDN'T -- I'M NOT GOOD AT THAT. I WASN'T GOOD AT THAT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT A PUSHY PERSON, TRYING TO SELL THINGS.
I'M NOT A PITCHER. I'M NOT LIKE A SALESMAN, LIKE, "HEY," YOU KNOW? IT'S WEIRD.
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW. I DO THAT.
YOU ARE A SALESMAN?
Jimmy: YEAH. I SELL THINGS ALL THE TIME.
OH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OKAY, WELL --
Jimmy: THAT'S PART OF MY JOB.
ANYWAY, I GUESS I WASN'T REALLY DOING A GOOD JOB FOR A A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MY CREATIVE PARTNER AND MANAGER, SHE SAID TO ME, BEFORE I WENT ONSET ONE DAY, SHE WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO STEP IT UP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WOAH.
"I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO DROP, LIKE, 15 GRAMMYS ON THEM."
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
"I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO TALK ABOUT WHY YOU'RE THE ONLY WOMAN ON THERE THAT'S A A PRODUCER AND A WRITER AND AN ARTIST. I NEED YOU -- "
Jimmy: YEAH.
" -- TO STEP IT UP." I WAS LIKE, "OKAY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DID. AND YOU STEPPED IT UP. HOW DO YOU HAVE TIME TO -- YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DID. AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SO GREAT. THIS ALBUM, YOU TOOK OVER TIMES SQUARE. LOOK AT THIS PHOTO. THIS IS AMAZING.
OH MY -- OH.
Jimmy: THAT'S REAL. THAT LOOKS FAKE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT LOOKS FAKE. THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
I WAS IN A DREAM. I GREW UP -- I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN NEW YORK CITY. THIS WAS A DREAM.
Jimmy: YEAH.
A LITERAL DREAM.
Jimmy: THAT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT PICTURE EXISTS. SERIOUSLY.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO COOL.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
Jimmy: TELL ME ABOUT THE ALBUM. WHAT DO FANS HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO?
OH, YOU'RE GONNA -- I JUST FEEL SO CONNECTED TO MUSIC, SO CONNECTED TO MYSELF, SO CONNECTED TO THE MESSAGE. I FEEL SO -- I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM I'VE EVER WRITTEN YET. AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS, YOU KNOW, BUT THIS IS REALLY ME MEETING MYSELF AND THE WORLD, US, THIS IS US MEETING HERE RIGHT NOW, AND THAT'S WHY I CALLED IT "HERE." BUT FOR SURE, THIS IS THE ALBUM I ALWAYS DREAMED TO DO, BUT I DIDN'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW TO EXECUTE IT. IT'S RAW. IT IS URGENT. IT'S A LOVE LETTER TO NEW YORK CITY. IT'S HONEST. IT'S VULNERABLE. IT'S THINGS THAT EVERYBODY CAN UNDERSTAND. IT IS SO, SO, SO POWERFUL. I CANNOT WAIT FOR YOU TO GO THERE AND BE HERE ON SATURDAY.
Jimmy: YEAH. "BLENDED FAMILY" IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING TONIGHT.
YES.
Jimmy: AND THAT IS BASED ON YOUR FAMILY.
"BLENDED FAMILY" IS A A BEAUTIFUL -- I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER AWESOME THING ABOUT THE ALBUM. IT REALLY TOPICALLY TALKS ABOUT THINGS THAT I DON'T THINK WE DON'T GET A LOT OF -- YOU DON'T HEAR THAT MUCH OR WE DON'T GET A CHANCE TO EXPLORE THAT MUCH. SO "BLENDED FAMILY" REALLY EXPLORES WHAT THE MODERN DAY FAMILY IS, AND WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE. AND THERE IS NO TRADITIONAL FAMILY, YOU KNOW? A BLENDED FAMILY CAN BE TWO MOMS WITH THEIR KIDS. A BLENDED FAMILY CAN BE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM TWO DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS BACKGROUNDS GETTING TOGETHER. A BLENDED FAMILY CAN BE AN ASIAN MOM AND A BLACK DAD. IT CAN BE LIKE MY FAMILY WHERE MY HUSBAND HAS CHILDREN FROM OTHER RELATIONSHIPS AND NOW WE ARE ALL ONE FAMILY UNIT, YOU KNOW, JUST LOVING, UPLIFTING EACH OTHER, AND IT CAN BE ANYTHING THAT IS SURROUNDED WITH LOVE. SO, THAT'S WHAT "BLENDED FAMILY" IS ABOUT. IT'S NOT OFTEN TALKED ABOUT, BUT WE'RE ALL BLENDED FAMILIES, SO IT'S -- IT'S DOPE.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY THAT FOR US TONIGHT, AND I CAN SAY, BECAUSE I'M SITTING NEXT TO YOU, I FEEL THE LOVE.
