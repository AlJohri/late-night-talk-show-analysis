Questlove: 430, TEXAS!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! THAT'S A HOT CROWD RIGHT THERE! I LOVE IT. I FEEL THE LOVE! I FEEL THE LOVE! [ CHEERS ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. I WAS GOING TO TELL A BUNCH OF JOKES ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, BUT I THINK TODAY MITT ROMNEY TOLD PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, MITT ROMNEY GAVE A BIG SPEECH AGAINST DONALD TRUMP TODAY AND SAID, QUOTE, "A BUSINESS GENIUS HE IS NOT." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN ROMNEY WAS LIKE, "YODA, MY SPEECHWRITER IS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ROMNEY ALSO SAID TRUMP'S PROMISES ARE AS WORTHLESS AS A A DEGREE FROM TRUMP UNIVERSITY. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] THEN TRUMP SAID, "OR AS WORTHLESS AS A ROMNEY 2012 POSTER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DURING HIS SPEECH, MITT ROMNEY ALSO SAID DONALD TRUMP IS PLAYING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC FOR A FREE RIDE TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND, QUOTE, "ALL WE GET IS A A LOUSY HAT." [ LAUGHTER ] NOT TO MENTION A $30 PICTURE OF HOW SCARED WE ALL LOOK ON THE WAY DOWN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GET THIS, I SAW THAT THE GOOGLE SEARCH "HOW TO MOVE TO CANADA" STARTED TRENDING AFTER -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN'T MAKE IT UP, MAN.
Steve: YOU CAN'T MAKE IT UP.
Jimmy: THE GOOGLE SEARCH "HOW TO MOVE TO CANADA" STARTED TRENDING AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S IMPRESSIVE SHOWING ON SUPER TUESDAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OR AS CANADIANS PUT IT, "GREAT, NOW WE NEED TO BUILD A WALL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DONALD TRUMP'S WIFE, MELANIA, WAS ASKED YESTERDAY TO DESCRIBE HER HUSBAND IN ONE WORD. CHECK OUT WHAT SHE SAID.
WHAT'S THE ONE WORD, YOU THINK, THAT DESCRIBES HIM?
AMAZING HEART. AMAZING MIND. LEADER. THAT'S WHAT I SAY. LEADER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHEN ASKED TO DESCRIBE HERSELF IN JUST ONE WORD MELANIA SAID, "MATH GENIUS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S SOME NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON. I READ THAT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT IS INVITING HACKERS TO TEST ITS CYBER SECURITY IN A A NEW PROGRAM CALLED "HACK THE PENTAGON." WHICH WILL BE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER NEW PROGRAM CALLED "OKAY, PLEASE STOP HACKING US. IT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A HORRIBLE IDEA. WHY DID WE THINK OF THIS?" PROGRAM. [ APPLAUSE ] I READ MAJOR AIRLINES WILL INTRODUCE A NEW CLASS OF SERVICE CALLED "BASIC ECONOMY" THAT OFFERS LOWER PRICE TICKETS FOR LESS AMENITIES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S A GOOD DEAL, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THESE BASIC ECONOMY FEATURES. CHECK THIS OUT. FIRST FEATURE IS -- MIDDLE SEATS AND BATHROOMS ARE NOW THE SAME THING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: THAT SEEMS LIKE NOT GOOD.
Jimmy: THEN INSTEAD OF BOARDING BY ROW, AIRLINES WILL JUST RING A BELL AND SAY "BRING IT." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RUDE.
Steve: THAT'S RUDE.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
Steve: THAT SEEMS LIKE MORE CONFUSION.
Jimmy: THEY'RE ALSO CHANGING IT SO PRE-FLIGHT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE READ SARCASTICALLY. "IN CASE OF A WATER LANDING THOSE SEAT CUSHIONS ARE TOTALLY GONNA SAVE YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] DIDN'T SOUND CONFIDENT. AND FINALLY, DRINKS WILL BE REPLACED WITH A JOINT TO BE PASSED FROM THE FRONT TO THE BACK OF THE AIRCRAFT. NO BOGARTING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO BOGARTING. WORTH THE PRICE. DID YOU SEE THIS? A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT THE FEMALE VIAGRA PILL ISN'T VERY EFFECTIVE. HOWEVER, WOMEN ARE STILL FAKING BEING TURNED ON SO THAT THEY DON'T HURT THE LITTLE PILL'S FEELINGS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "IT'S OKAY, HONEY, YOU HAD A A ROUGH DAY." AND FINALLY, I READ THAT ASTRONAUT SCOTT KELLY GREW TWO INCHES AFTER SPENDING NEARLY A A YEAR IN SPACE. BECAUSE WITHOUT GRAVITY PUSHING DOWN, THE VERTEBRAE CAN STRETCH. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY KEVIN HART'S NEXT FIVE MOVIES ARE BEING FILMED IN SPACE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW! GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

SO SINCE ASTRONAUT SCOTT KELLY AND HIS BROTHER MARK ARE BEING STUDIED BY NASA TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF SPACE ON THE BODY, I WENT ON TWITTER AND STARTED A HASHTAG CALLED "MY SIBLING IS WEIRD." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I ASKED YOU GUYS TO TWEET OUT SOMETHING FUNNY, WEIRD OR EMBARRASSING ABOUT YOUR SIBLING. I TWEETED OUT THAT MY SISTER USED TO WEAR A BIKE HELMET WHEN SHE WENT ON THE SWING IN OUR BACK YARD. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN SHE TWEETED MY BROTHER WOULD WEAR A FOOTBALL HELMET TO GO -- AND SHE'S RIGHT. IT WASN'T A BIKE HELMET. IT WAS A FOOTBALL HELMET. BECAUSE WE HAD A TREE SWING AND MY GRANDFATHER WAS REALLY NERVOUS THAT WE'D HIT OUR HEADS ON THE SWING.
Steve: SO HE MADE YOU WEAR FOOTBALL HELMETS.
Jimmy: SO WE BOTH WORE FOOTBALL HELMETS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS SO WEIRD. BUT ALSO WE HAD A CHAIN LINK FENCE, SO EVERY KID WHO RODE THEIR BIKE BUY WOULD JUST LOOK AT US AND BE LIKE, "THOSE WEIRDOS, MAN." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND LONERS TOO. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THOSE KIDS? [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, WE GOT THOUSANDS OF TWEETS. WITHIN 30 MINUTES IT WAS A A TRENDING TOPIC IN THE U.S. SO THANK YOU FOR THOSE TWEETS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HAD A WEIRD CHILDHOOD.
