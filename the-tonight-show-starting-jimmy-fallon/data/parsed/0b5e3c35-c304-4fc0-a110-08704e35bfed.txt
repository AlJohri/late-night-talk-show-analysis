TONIGHT WAS THE FIRST REPUBLICAN DEBATE OVER ON FOX NEWS, AND BEFORE THE DEBATE THE MODERATOR, CHRIS WALLACE, SAID THERE'S, "SO DOGGONE MANY CANDIDATES" THAT HE PLANNED ON ASKING THEM SOME "DOOZEYS." HE WOULD HAVE SAID MORE BUT HE HAD TO GO BACK TO THE SODA SHOP HE WORKED IN IN 1954. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "IT'S THE BEE'S KNEES, MRS. WALTER." THAT'S RIGHT, THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE WAS TONIGHT, AND APPARENTLY, THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE WAS ACTUALLY SO WORRIED ABOUT THE CANDIDATES INSULTING EACH OTHER, THEY ASKED THEM TO STOP CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CAMPAIGN SO FAR THEY MIGHT BE RUNNING OUT OF NAMES TO CALL EACH OTHER. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THEY'VE LITERALLY GOTTEN THROUGH THE ENTIRE ALPHABET.

10.
Steve: 10, THE CORRECT ANSWER IS 11. SALMA WINS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [DOG BARKING ]
OH MY GOD. I'M IN HEAVEN. I'M IN HEAVEN. I'M IN PUPPY HEAVEN, AND I BEAT JIMMY. I KNOW HOW MUCH HE HATES IT. I BEAT HIM LAST TIME WITH SOME BEER GAME, AND HE WAS NOT HAPPY. OH MY GOD. LOOK AT THIS.
Jimmy: YOU GUYS OUR THANKS TO SALMA HAYEK, THE CHAMPION AND ALL OF THESE ADORABLE PUPPIES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "THE PROPHET" OPENS IN NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES TOMORROW. TIM GUNN JOINS US NEXT. STICK AROUND EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ DOG BARKING ]
Jimmy: SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL PERSON. OUR NEXT GUEST IS AT THE TOP OF THE FASHION GAME. HE'S A BEST SELLING AUTHOR AND THE EMMY AWARD WINNING CO-HOST OF "PROJECT RUNWAY" THAT JUST RETURNED FOR ITS 14th SEASON TONIGHT ON "LIFETIME." PLEASE WELCOME TIM GUNN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ALWAYS LOOKING GREAT.
THRILLED TO BE HERE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION THOUGH?
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
WAS IT JUST ME, OR DID SALMA HAYEK LOOK POSITIVELY ORGASMIC WITH THOSE DOGS? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WITH THE DOGS, YES. WITH THE DOGS AS WELL, YEAH. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL PERSON. THE DOGS LOVED HER BACK AS WELL. IT WAS PERFECT BONDING.
AND I HAVE TO FOLLOW SALMA HAYEK AND A BUNCH OF DOGS.
Jimmy: NO. THEY'RE DEFINITELY ADORABLE. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION BECAUSE WE HAD HEIDI KLUM ON THE SHOW, AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU WON THE "EMMY." CONGRATULATIONS, BY THE WAY.
YES, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND NOW YOU'RE NOMINATED AGAIN.
AND YOU'RE NOMINATED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M VERY HAPPY. SHE SAID WHEN YOU WON, SHE HAD BEEN DRINKING.
WE WERE A LITTLE INEBRIATED, I WILL SAY. BUT IT WAS CHAMPAGNE. IT WAS THE CHAMPAGNE BUZZ.
Jimmy: IT WAS A CLASSY BUZZ.
IT WAS A VERY CLASSY BUZZ. BUT WE WERE NUMBER 104 OUT OF 105 CATEGORIES.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
SO THERE WAS A LOT OF CHAMPAGNE DRINKING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MY GOD. DO YOU REMEMBER ACTUALLY WINNING?
I REMEMBER WINNING VIVIDLY. IT'S WHAT SOBERED US UP. AND I REMEMBER PLANTING A BIG, WET, SLOPPY KISS ALL OVER NEIL PATRICK HARRIS. AND THEN, WE SAID SOMETHING AT THE PODIUM, AND WHEN WE GOT BACKSTAGE HEIDI LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, "WHAT DID WE JUST SAY?" I SAID, "I HAVEN'T A CLUE." [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE NO IDEA, BUT IT WAS THRILLING.
Jimmy: WELL, CONGRATS ON THAT, TOO.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THEN YOU GOT NOMINATED AGAIN, WHICH IS ANOTHER THRILL.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WE WERE SAYING BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT ONCE YOU NORMALLY WIN AN "EMMY," THEN YOU THINK SHE WILL -- "DON'T GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE."
WELL, WE WON IN 2013. WE WERE NOMINATED THE FOLLOWING YEAR. WE LOST IN 2014. SO I THOUGHT, "OH I WILL NEVER BE NOMINATED AGAIN, BUT STILL I HAVE MY GORGEOUS "EMMY" RIGHT NEXT TO MY COFFEE MAKER IN MY KITCHEN." BUT WE WERE NOMINATED AGAIN. SO PEOPLE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT US.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: NO THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE NEW SEASON OF THIS STARTS TONIGHT ON "LIFETIME," BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT, I WANT TO KNOW, THERE'S A A "PROJECT RUNWAY JUNIOR."
OH, IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL -- I JUST LEFT THEM. 13-17.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE RULES? SO, THEY HAVE TO BE 13-17, AND THEY'RE LITTLE DESIGNERS.
THEY'RE PHENOMENAL. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY INSPIRATIONAL PHENOMENONS. I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF OF HOW YOUNG THEY ARE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND FRANKLY, I THINK THEY COULD LEAVE THE ADULTS IN THEIR DUST. IF ANYONE'S IN DOUBT ABOUT OUR FUTURE, JUST LOOKING AT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, THE FUTURE COULDN'T LOOK BRIGHTER.
Jimmy: REALLY? OH, THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IS IT TOUGH TO JUDGE?
YES. FORTUNATELY, I'M NOT A JUDGE, BUT I INTERACT WITH THE JUDGES. THEY DON'T WANT TO SEND ANYONE HOME. THERE ARE TEARS.
Jimmy: ARE THEY CRYING?
NO. NOT THE KIDS. THE JUDGES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? OF COURSE.
OH, NO, YEAH. THE KIDS ARE MATURE. THEY'RE PROFESSIONAL. THEY BEHAVE BETTER THAN THE GROWN-UPS.
Jimmy: THERE'S NOT AS MUCH DRAMA AS ON THE NORMAL "PROJECT RUNWAY." I SAW SOME PROMOS FOR THIS NEW SEASON. IT'S ALMOST LOOKS LIKE YOU LOSE YOUR COOL A LITTLE BIT.
IT'S NOT ALMOST LIKE. "BIG DADDY" BLOWS UP. [ LAUGHTER ] I GET TO A POINT WHERE I AM AT MY SATURATION LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION AND ANGER TO A A DEGREE, AND I SAY ABOUT MYSELF VERY MATTER-OF-FACTLY, I'M VERY FLEXIBLE. I WILL BEND AND BEND AND BEND UNTIL I SNAP AND I -- YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND WHEN IT HAPPENS, AND IT HAPPENED.
BUT THERE'S ONE CHALLENGE WHERE I REALLY LOSE IT. THEY'RE DOING A MAKEOVER OF WHAT WE CALL "REGULAR WOMEN" AND THEY'RE OUR CREW MEMBERS. THEY'RE PEOPLE I HAVE WORKED WITH FOR 14 SEASONS, SO I KNOW THESE WOMEN INTIMATELY AND I FELT VERY PROTECTIVE OF THEM AND PROPRIETARY ABOUT THE LOOK THESE DESIGNERS WERE GOING TO GIVE THEM. WE DID THE WORK ROOM ROUNDS TOGETHER, THE CREW MEMBERS AND I, LOOKING AT THE WORK AND THE DESIGNERS WEREN'T LISTENING TO THEM. THIS IS A MAKEOVER. THIS IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DNA AS A DESIGNER AND WHAT THIS INDIVIDUAL HAPPENS TO WANT AND DESIRE. AND YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO HER. "WELL, NO, IT'S ALL ABOUT ME." "LISTEN SISTER, IT'S NOT JUST ALL ABOUT YOU."
Jimmy: WHOA, WHOA, WAIT. I DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS SIDE. I DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS SIDE OF YOU.
NO, YOU DON'T.
Jimmy: I DON'T.
YOU DON'T.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT GETS YOU THE EMMY'S THOUGH BUDDY. CONGRATS ON THE NEW SEASON.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jimmy: AND I LOVE YOU. COME BACK.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: BEST TO HEIDI, TOO.
