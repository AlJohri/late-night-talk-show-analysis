Jimmy: THEY ALL GAVE YOU 50%. AND WERE YOU GOOD?
YEAH, I WAS GREAT. I WAS REALLY INTO CUSTOMER SERVICE.

HOPEFULLY. BUT IT'S AN INTIMATE TIME AND IT'S A TIME TO THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GET TO DO. WHEN YOU DO A FRAGRANCE, IT ALLOWS YOU THE LICENSE TO BE PROVOCATIVE TO, YOU KNOW, HAVE SOME SEXY TIME. [ CHEERS ]
