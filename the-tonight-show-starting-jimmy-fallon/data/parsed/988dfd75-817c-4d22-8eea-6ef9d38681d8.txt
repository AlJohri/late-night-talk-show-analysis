[ CHEERS ] FUN NEW YORK CITY CROWD. HERE'S WHAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN HAVING SOME BIG SECURITY ISSUES LATELY. AFTER AN INTRUDER ACTUALLY MANAGED TO JUMP THE FENCE AND MAKE IT INSIDE. HE MADE HIMSELF A SANDWICH AND HUNG OUT, HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH." AND THIS IS TRUE, THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THAT FROM NOW ON IT WILL START LOCKING ITS DOORS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED IF HE WANTED A KEY, BIDEN SAID, "I'M FINE JUST USING THE DOGGIE DOOR." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "I CAN JUST GO IN AND OUT AS I PLEASE. NO ONE BOTHERS ME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. GET TO EAT AS MUCH AS I WANT." OF COURSE, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW FOR THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY. [ CHEERS ] ARE YOU APPLAUDING THE TRAFFIC YOU WERE STUCK IN TODAY? BUT I HEARD THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN WILL NOT BE ATTENDING. NO. WHEN ASKED WHY, HE SAID -- [ RUSSIAN ACCENT ] "I WAS JUST THERE FOR FASHION WEEK. EVERY TIME I HAVE TO COME IN AND OUT." [ LAUGHTER ] VLADIMIR PUTIN WILL NOT BE IN NEW YORK FOR U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY, NOT WITH ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES LEFT UNATTENDED FOR THE WEEK. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S LIKE -- [ RUSSIAN ACCENT ] "WHICH ONE SHOULD I TAKE? POLAND, I'LL TAKE POLAND, AND --" [ CHEERS ] "IT'S THE BEST WEEK EVER! IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS! THIS IS LIKE CHRISTMAS COME EARLY. HE-HE-HE-HE." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, LEADERS AND AMBASSADORS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE HERE IN THE CITY FOR A WEEK OF MEETINGS. WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WILL BE LYING IN THEIR HOTEL BEDS AT NIGHT LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO WATCH, AND MOST LIKELY COME ACROSS THIS SHOW. [ CHEERS ] IT'S A BIG DEAL. SO I THOUGHT THAT I COULD TAKE SOME TIME NOW TO TELL SOME MONOLOGUE JOKES SPECIFICALLY FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE U.N. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO PRESSURE. DURING A RECENT FUNDRAISER, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE REVEALED THAT HE HAS LOST 85 POUNDS SINCE HAVING LAPBAND SURGERY LAST YEAR.

I READ THAT HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER IS FACING CRITICISM OVER A RECENT SPEECH WHERE HE SUGGESTED THAT UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE ARE LAZY. BOEHNER WOULD HAVE CLARIFIED HIS STATEMENTS BUT HE WAS ON HIS SECOND TWO WEEK BREAK OF THE MONTH. SO THAT'S WHY HE WAS UNAVAILABLE.

Jimmy: AND LONDON ROSE --
I GET THAT A LOT FROM PEOPLE, THOUGH. THEY'RE LIKE, ARE YOU A A HANDS-ON DAD? PEOPLE WILL STILL -- PROBABLY ASK YOU THIS, TOO. LIKE, DO YOU CHANGE DIAPERS?
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
OF COURSE. PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT.
Jimmy: ARE YOU MORE LOOSE WITH THE THIRD BABY?
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. THE FIRST BABY, THEY SLEEP IN YOUR ROOM FOR A WHILE. BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU GOT SIX MONTHS OR SOMETHING, THEN FINALLY THEY GO. BABY NUMBER TWO, MAYBE THREE MONTHS, BUT YOU GET A MONITOR. RIGHT? SO YOU CAN WATCH THE BABY. AND THEN SHE GOES -- BY THE TIME NUMBER THREE COMES, YOU JUST -- SIX WEEKS, YOU GET THEM OUT. AND YOU TAKE YOUR MONITOR, AND THAN GO TO YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE TO SEE IF IT WILL WORK THAT FAR. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
Jimmy: YEAH, RIGHT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YES, THE MONITOR WORKS!
Jimmy: YEAH, THE MONITOR WORKS! AWESOME!
THAT WAY, YOU'RE JUST THERE. IF I LEAVE NOW, IT WILL TAKE ME 12 MINUTES TO GET HOME.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT. YEAH, I'M OBSESSED WITH THE MONITOR.
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOU?
Jimmy: SHE'S GREAT. I TRICKED HER INTO SAYING DADA. UH, WHICH IS A GREAT --
DID SHE SAY DADA BEFORE MAMA?
Jimmy: NO, SHE SAID MAMA FIRST. BUT I -- BUT NOW I I PLAY A A GAME WITH HER. I GO, "DON'T SAY DADA." AND SHE GOES, "DADA." AND THEN, I GO OVER AND I TICKLE HER. AND NOW, SHE'S OBSESSED WITH SAYING -- BUT, SHE DOESN'T KNOW. IT'S REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT EVERYONE AROUND YOU IS HAVING BABIES. I MEAN, SAVANNAH GUTHRIE JUST HAD A BABY. SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL BABY.
YEAH.
CHRISTINA AGUILERA JUST HAD ANOTHER BABY.
Jimmy: YES. I MEAN, "THE VOICE," THE BACKSTAGE HAS GOT TO BE LIKE --
IT'S LIKE A FERTILITY CLINIC. IT'S CRAZY. HONESTLY, PEOPLE COME TO THE SHOW BACKSTAGE, THEY'RE EXPECTING, "A," LIKE, TOTAL ROCK STAR. YOU KNOW, SHOTS, AND ALL THAT. LIKE JACK DANIELS EVERYWHERE.
