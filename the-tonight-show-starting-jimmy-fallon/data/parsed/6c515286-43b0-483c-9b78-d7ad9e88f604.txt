THIS IS IT! WELCOME, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU GUYS, TODAY IS CINCO DE MAYO. [ CHEERING ] OR AS DONALD TRUMP CALLS IT, MAY 5th. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, IT SEEMS LIKE DONALD TRUMP MAY ACTUALLY BE INTO CINCO DE MAYO BASED ON THE TWEET HE SENT OUT TODAY AND THIS IS REAL. IT SAYS, "HAPPY CINCO DE MAYO, THE BEST TACO BOWLS ARE MADE IN TRUMP TOWER GRILL. I LOVE HISPANICS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "AND THE BEST JALAPENO POPPERS CAN BE FOUND AT THE T.G.I. FRIDAYS IN SECAUCUS, NEW JERSEY. I LOVE AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD. I LOVE AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD. SENOR FROGS."

Steve: SOUTH OF THE BORDER.
Jimmy: I CAN'T WAIT FOR CHINESE NEW YEAR TO SEE HIM HUNKER DOWN IN A BOWL OF PANDA EXPRESS. THAT'S JUST GOING TO BE GREAT. [ APPLAUSE ] AND NOW THAT TRUMP HAS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION LOCKED UP, "THE NEW YORK TIMES" RAN AN ARTICLE THAT DETAILS DONALD TRUMP'S PLANS FOR HIS FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE, AND TRUMP WAS LIKE, "CAN I GET A A COPY OF THAT, BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T THINK THIS THROUGH. DID I SAY THAT? I SAID THAT, TOO? PERFECT. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT." AND LAST NIGHT, LESTER HOLT INTERVIEWED DONALD TRUMP FROM HIS OFFICE AT TRUMP TOWER, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMMENTING ON HOW THEY SEEM TO BE SITTING ON SOME REALLY SMALL CHAIRS. I DON'T KNOW. SEE WHAT YOU THINK.
WAS THAT A FIRST 100 DAYS? [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: A LITTLE SMALL. A LITTLE SMALL. YEAH. WHO'S TO JUDGE? MEANWHILE, PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO HOW TRUMP MIGHT HANDLE FOREIGN AFFAIRS. YESTERDAY HE EVEN EXPLAINED HOW HE'D STAND UP TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. LISTEN TO THIS.
ON TWO OCCASIONS, RUSSIAN FIGHTERS JETS BARREL ROLLED U.S. MILITARY FACILITY --
LACK OF RESPECT. LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE UNITED STATES.
