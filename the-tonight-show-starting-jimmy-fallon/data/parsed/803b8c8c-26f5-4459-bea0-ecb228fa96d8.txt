[ LAUGHTER ] STILL, I'M JUST SAYING. [ APPLAUSE ] IT SHOULDN'T LOOK LIKE THIS. ONE PRETZEL, PLEASE. THINGS ARE MOVING PRETTY QUICKLY OVER THERE. IN FACT, THIS WEEKEND, CRIMEA IS HOLDING A VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO JOIN RUSSIA, BUT THE BALLOT DOESN'T HAVE AN OPTION FOR VOTING AGAINST THE PLAN. [ LAUGHTER ] IT ONLY LETS PEOPLE VOTE FOR JOINING RUSSIA NOW OR DOWN THE ROAD. WHEN ASKED WHERE HE GOT THE IDEA, VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID, "iTUNES USER AGREEMENT."

LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON OVER IN WASHINGTON. I READ THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO SHORTEN PRISON TIME FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF DRUG-RELATED OFFENSES.

AND HER FAMILY HAD BOUGHT HIM, IT GETS SO MUCH WORSE. JUST HANG ON. DON'T GO LIKE, AW. SO THE FAMILY HAD GOT HIM A NEW PICK-UP TRUCK BECAUSE OUR DAUGHTER IS WORTH A PICKUP TRUCK IF WE CAN JUST GET HER MARRIED. SO THEY'RE DOING FIRST DANCE A, LIKE THE BRIDE AND GROOM, YOU KNOW THE FATHER AND MOM AND ALL THAT STUFF AND THE BEST MAN RAN OUT AND HE DECORATED THE PICKUP TRUCK. SO THEN THE BRIDE AND GROOM LEAVE TO GO OFF ON THEIR WEDDED HONEYMOON AND EVERYONE STARTS DANCING. AND THEN THE GROOM COMES BACK IN AND GOES WHO PUT ALL THAT CRAP ON MY TRUCK? AND THE BEST MAN GOES, HEY I DID, BUDDY. AND PUNCHED -- HE PUNCHED HIS BEST MAN, BROKE HIS JAW AND THEN THE FATHER TURNED TO ME LIKE, HEY, YOU GOT TO SAVE THIS. NOW IT'S ON ME.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. UNBELIEVABLE. UH -- SO, I'M NATE. PRETTY LAZY GUY. I REALIZED HOW LAZY I WAS RECENTLY. I WAS WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME. I WAS SITTING ON MY COUCH, AND I WAS GOING TO GO GET SOMETHING TO DRINK. RIGHT WHEN I GET UP TO GO, ONE TEAM KICKED OFF TO THE OTHER TEAM. BEFORE I COULD GET BACK, THEY RAN 100-YARD KICKOFF RETURN, AND I MISSED IT. LIKE, THE GUY RAN 100 YARDS BEFORE I COULD GET THREE TO MAYBE FOUR YARDS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT GUY ALSO HAD 11 PEOPLE REALLY TRYING NOT TO LET HIM RUN 100 YARDS. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAD NOBODY. NO ONE CARED WHAT I WAS DOING. WHEN YOU WATCH SPORTING EVENTS, TOO. I FEEL LIKE THE COMMERCIALS THAT THEY HAVE -- THEY'RE LIKE ADVERTISING TOWARDS, LIKE, PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES. LIKE, THEY'LL HAVE LIKE RUNNING SHOES. THEY'LL BE LIKE, "OH, YOU SHOULD BUY THESE SHOES." THEN, IT SHOWS, LIKE, AN NFL PLAYER RUNNING WITH A TIRE TIED TO HIS BACK. AND YOU'RE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, WELL, HOW DO THOSE SHOES LOOK WITH JEANS AND SITTING DOWN?" [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I WOULD BE USING THEM. I HAVE TO GET A TIRE AND A A ROPE? THAT'S A LOT. THAT'S A LOT YOU'RE ASKING. [ LAUGHTER ] SOMEONE GAVE ME AN UNDER ARMOUR SHIRT. DO YOU KNOW THOSE? IT'S LIKE, SKIN TIGHT. LIKE, IT JUST SHOWS THE WORST PARTS OF YOUR BODY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I LOOKED BETTER WITHOUT A SHIRT ON THAN WITH THAT SHIRT ON. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BRUTAL. YOU KNOW, LIKE IN PLASTIC SURGERY HOW THEY DRAW MARKERS ON YOU AND STUFF? LIKE, THEY SHOULD JUST PUT YOU IN THAT SHIRT AND BE LIKE, "OBVIOUSLY, YOU CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GO AFTER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THE TARGET AREAS. I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE I HAVE TO GET BACK IN SHAPE, BUT I MEAN, I'VE NEVER BEEN IN SHAPE, SO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MOST PEOPLE ARE LIKE, IF I CAN GET BACK TO MY 20s. I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO 7. LIKE IF I COULD GO BACK, WHEN I WAS 7, I WAS KILLING IT. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR ME, A GOOD WORKOUT WOULD BE -- WALKING TO McDONALD'S WOULD BE A GREAT START, YOU KNOW? MAYBE STAND UP AND EAT IT. SEE IF THAT DOES SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ] INSTEAD, I ORDERED THE P90X VIDEOS. THOUGHT I COULD DO THAT, YOU KNOW. NEVER WORKED OUT A DAY IN MY LIFE, SO LET'S DO WHAT THE NAVY SEALS DO. [ LAUGHTER ] I -- I DID NOT DO IT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT MADE ME ORDER IT? LIKE, YOU KNOW IN THE COMMERCIAL? YOU KNOW, THEY SHOW LIKE, A A "BEFORE" BODY AND THEN AN "AFTER" BODY? I WAS LIKE, BLOWN AWAY BY THE "BEFORE" BODY. I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU GET TO LOOK LIKE. I WAS LIKE THAT GUY LOOKS GREAT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEN I SAW THE "AFTER" BODY, AND I WAS LIKE "DOES THE 'BEFORE' BODY GUY HAVE A DVD, BECAUSE THAT GUY LOOKS MORE MY SPEED, YOU KNOW?"E [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, WHAT DID HE DO TO GET TO THAT, AND I'LL JUST DO THAT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NO, COME ON. THANK YOU, GUYS. I SIGNED UP FOR A MIXED MARTIAL ARTS CLASS AS WELL. I MADE IT ONE DAY. THAT'S IT. LIKE, THEY WANT YOU -- IT'S ABOUT FIGHTING IS WHAT THAT CLASS IS ABOUT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE, SOME GUYS WOULD MAYBE DO PUSH-UPS OR SOMETHING. THE FIRST DAY I GO IN, THEY JUST PAIR ME UP WITH SOME 16-YEAR-OLD KID THAT WANTS TO FIGHT FOR A LIVING AND WASN'T RAISED BY HUMAN PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY'RE LIKE, WHY DON'T YOU ALL JUST GO AT IT? AND I WAS LIKE "WELL, I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFERENT GOALS. MAYBE THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD NOT GO AT IT." I BELIEVE HE'S TRAINING FOR THE HUNGER GAMES. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST WANT YOU NOT TO BE ABLE TO SEE MY NIPPLES THROUGH MY SHIRT, SO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, LEVELS. MMA IS A GREAT WAY TO PROTECT YOURSELF, THOUGH. I WATCHED, UH -- HERE'S ANOTHER WAY IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT. I WATCHED A THING ON "60 MINUTES." THEY DID THIS PIECE ABOUT BUYING TIGERS. LIKE YOU CAN BUY -- LIKE, IF YOU GUYS WANT A TIGER, I COULD GET YOU IN TOUCH WITH A A GUY THAT CAN GIVE YOU A A PRETTY SWEET DEAL ON A TIGER. [ LAUGHTER ] "60 MINUTES" DID THIS WHOLE UNDERCOVER REPORT, AND THEY FILMED, LIKE, WHERE THIS GUY KEEPS TIGERS, AND THEN THEY INTERVIEWED HIM AFTERWARDS. THEY'RE LIKE, "HEY, DO YOU THINK IT'S TOO EASY TO BUY A A TIGER IN THIS COUNTRY?" AND HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH. SADLY IT IS. IT'S WAY TOO EASY." AND I WAS LIKE -- THAT WAS MY FAVORITE PART, YOU KNOW? LIKE, THAT SHOWS WHY AMERICA IS THE BEST. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU COULD BUY TIGERS BEFORE I WATCHED THIS. I WOULD'VE BEEN EMBARRASSED TO ASK. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN I WATCHED IT, AND I WAS LIKE, I DON'T REALLY HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS IF I WANT TO BUY A TIGER. IT'S NOT AN ALL-DAY THING. IT'S AN HOUR. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH OUR TIGER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET TO RID OF GUNS. AND WHAT MAKES ME NERVOUS IS LIKE, IF YOU TOOK AWAY GUNS FROM PEOPLE, THOSE ARE THE EXACT SAME PEOPLE THAT WILL BUY TIGERS, AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE LIKE, "LOOK, HERE'S YOUR GUN BACK." THEY'LL BE LIKE, "NO, I'M GOOD. MY TIGER IS WAY BETTER THAN MY GUN." [ LAUGHTER ] MY GUN MISSED ALL THE TIME. MY TIGER RARELY MISSES. EVEN IF HE DOES MISS, YOU KNOW. EVEN IF HE DOES MISS, IT'S JUST FOR A SECOND. IT'S NEVER LONG. LIKE IF SOME GUY DODGES THE TIGER, AND HE'S LIKE, "YOUR DUMB TIGER MISSED." IT'S LIKE, WELL, HE DID NOT. HE IS RIGHT BEHIND YOU NOW, AND HE IS FURIOUS, SO -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH, MAN. YOU GUYS WERE GREAT. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
