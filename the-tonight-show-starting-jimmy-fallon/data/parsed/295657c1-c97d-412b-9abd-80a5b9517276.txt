TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- JAMES SPADER, KERMIT THE FROG, MUSICAL GUEST BLACK 47, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW. AND NOW, HERE'S YOUR HOST JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DON'T WORRY. I WON'T REMEMBER ANY OF THIS TOMORROW. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. I WISH EVERYONE A HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY TO EVERYONE OUT THERE. YOU HAVING A GOOD DAY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY. THANKS TO ALL THE FANS WHO WISHED ME A HAPPY HOLIDAY. THANK YOU TO THE PEOPLE WHO VISITED NEW YORK CITY TO CELEBRATE. AND MOST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR LEAVING YOUR TV ON NBC BEFORE YOU PASSED OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [ APPLAUSE ] AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING ON DVR, GO GET A GATORADE AND ENJOY THIS. ST. PATRICK'S DAY IS A HUGE DEAL HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. I SAW THAT TWO MILLION PEOPLE TURNED OUT TODAY FOR THE ANNUAL ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE. [ CHEERS ] IT'S THE ONE PARADE WHERE THE HORSES ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE TO WATCH WHERE THEY STEP. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? THEY GO -- MMM, DEFINITELY. SOMEONE ATE PIZZA THERE, WILBUR. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: SOMEBODY HAD HOT DOGS.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S PRETTY AMAZING. AMERICANS ARE EXPECTED TO SPEND $255 MILLION ON BEER FOR ST. PATRICK'S DAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] 255 MILLION.
Tariq: MAKE THAT 255 MILLION AND $6. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S JUST SAY, AIN'T NO COFFEE IN THIS MUG TODAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: TARIQ, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Tariq: JUST STOPPING BY, SAYING HI. GREEN TIE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
Tariq: YEAH, YOU KNOW, THAT'S RIGHT. TODAY IS ST. PATRICK'S DAY. AND TOMORROW IS ST. HANGOVER'S DAY. TOP O' THE HEADACHE TO YA! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, IT SOUNDS GOOD. SOUNDS GOOD, TARIQ.
Tariq: YEAH, YEAH. JUST A LITTLE MONDAY HUMOR. GET THE WEEK GOING. I LIKE THIS. WE HAVE A GOOD RAPPORT.
Jimmy: YEP.
Tariq: IT'S GOOD.
Jimmy: YEP. HEY, THANK YOU.
Tariq: SO ALL RIGHTY. I GUESS I'LL LET YOU GET BACK TO THE YOLKS. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, SEE WHO DIPPED IN TO THE OFFICE MARCH MADNESS POOL?
Jimmy: I DID.
Tariq: SLAM DUNK!
Jimmy: YOU DUNKED YOUR DOUGHNUT IN A MUG OF BEER.
Tariq: MORE LIKE DRUNKEN DOUGHNUTS, AM I RIGHT?
Jimmy: TAKE CARE, BUDDY. GOOD TO SEE YOU, PAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. HE'S IN A GREAT MOOD THERE, YES? DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. HE WON'T REMEMBER ANY OF THAT TOMORROW. THE BIG STORY RIGHT NOW IS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN UKRAINE. IN FACT, A NEW POLL FOUND THAT TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICANS ARE FOLLOWING THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE. WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE. USUALLY YOU CAN'T FIND TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICANS WHO ARE FOLLOWING THE SITUATION IN AMERICA. WHO'S THE PRESIDENT? JACK BAUER. NO, HE WASN'T EVEN THE PRESIDENT ON -- FORGET IT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY DID YOU ANSWER SO QUICKLY? I DON'T KNOW. KIEFER SUTHERLAND. I GOT TO SAY, THINGS ARE MOVING PRETTY FAST. JUST YESTERDAY IN A HIGHLY DEBATED ELECTION, 95% OF CRIMEA VOTED TO SECEDE FROM UKRAINE AND JOIN RUSSIA. WHILE 5% GOT TO TRY AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] [ WITH RUSSIAN ACCENT ] "LOOKS LIKE YOU ANSWERED WRONG." 95% VOTED TO JOIN RUSSIA. EVEN KIM JONG-UN WAS LIKE, "YEAH, RIGHT." OF COURSE, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SKEPTICAL OF THESE RESULTS. SO OFFICIALS IN CRIMEA ACTUALLY PUBLISHED AN EXIT POLL TO SHOW THE RESULTS WERE AUTHENTIC. AND SOME OF THESE -- JUST AVERAGE CRIMEANS. SEE WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. LOOK, HERE'S BORIS VOLKOV SAID, "A SMART VOTE, RUSSIA IS STRONG COUNTRY. YOU WOULD BE A FOOL NOT TO JOIN." NIKOLAI SMIRNOV SAID, "SMART VOTE, RUSSIA IS STRONG COUNTRY. YOU WOULD BE FOOL NOT TO JOIN." WHILE MARINA ZUKOV SAID, "SMART VOTE, RUSSIA IS STRONG COUNTRY. YOU WOULD BE A FOOL NOT TO JOIN." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NORMAL PEOPLE. THEY ALL SEEM TO LOVE IT.
Steve: THEY LOOK SIMILAR.
Jimmy: THEY ALL SEEM TO LOVE IT.
Steve: ALL CRIMEANS LOOK SIMILAR.
Jimmy: AND THE U.S. IS VERY UPSET OVER ALL THIS. IN FACT, TO RETALIATE, THE U.S. IS THREATENING TO FREEZE RUSSIA'S ASSETS. WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD MOVE UNTIL YOU REALIZE VODKA DOESN'T FREEZE. IT ACTUALLY TASTES BETTER. HERE'S SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS. THERE'S A NEW POLL OUT THAT FOUND THAT ONLY 8% OF REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY WANT CHRIS CHRISTIE TO JUMP INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. AND 0% WANT CHRISTIE TO JUMP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THEIR SEESAW.
Steve: OH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: GUYS, MARCH MADNESS IS FINALLY HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: BOING!
Jimmy: EVERYBODY'S FILLING OUT THEIR BRACKETS AFTER SELECTION SUNDAY. AND THIS IS COOL. WICHITA STATE WILL BECOME THE FIRST UNDEFEATED TEAM IN 23 YEARS TO ENTER THE NCAA TOURNAMENT. WHEN ASKED HOW THEY REMAIN SO FOCUSED ON WINNING, THEY SAID, "WE PLAY IN WICHITA." [ LAUGHTER ] NOT MANY DISTRACTIONS HERE. AND FINALLY, THIS MADE ME LAUGH. A LOCAL NEWSCASTER FROM ARIZONA WAS COVERING THE PAC-12 BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT IN LAS VEGAS ON FRIDAY. HE WAS REALLY EXCITED, REALLY PUMPED. HE WAS FROM OUTSIDE THE ARENA. HE TOLD VIEWERS HE WAS GOING TO RUSH INSIDE AND DO HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE GAME. WELL, CHECK OUT WHAT HAPPENED.
WE AT KBOA NEWS FOUR ARE VERY COMMITTED, SO COMMITTED I'M GOING TO SIGN OFF NOW BECAUSE I WANT TO GET THERE BY THE TIME EVERYTHING TIPS OFF. SO I'M GOING TO HAND THE MICROPHONE OVER TO MY BUDDY DANNY HERE, AND GO WILDCATS.
ALL RIGHT. HEY, PAUL, GET YOU INSIDE. ENJOY THAT GAME. WE'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH. I JUST WANT TO SAY, I'M JUST SO GLAD HE WASN'T DOING A REPORT ON SCISSORS. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, RIGHT THERE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WELCOME! THAT'S A CROWD RIGHT THERE. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT A FUN DAY. HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY TO YOU THERE, HIGGINS.
Steve: WELL, HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY TO YOU, MR. FALLON. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW THEY TALK IN IRELAND. ALL OF IRELAND IS JUST LIKE ONE BIG LUCKY CHARM.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE. THAT'S NOT TRUE.
Steve: I'VE READ THAT SOMEWHERE. YOU READ THAT AND YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THERE?
Jimmy: NO, I'VE BEEN THERE A A BUNCH OF TIMES. I'M VERY IRISH. YOU'RE IRISH, RIGHT, HIGGINS?
Steve: JUST ENGLISH.
Jimmy: ENGLISH? SORRY, HIGGINS. I KNOW YOU.
Steve: IT'S IRISH, SURE.
Jimmy: I'VE MET YOU BEFORE. HIGGINS I KNOW IS A VERY IRISH NAME AS WELL, BUT NOT FALLON. IT'S O'FUELLON. SEAMUS O'FUELLON.
Steve: IS THAT WHAT IT WAS?
Jimmy: THAT'S THE IRISH -- THAT'S THE REAL NAME, YEAH. THAT'S MY ACTUAL -- "THE TONIGHT SHOW."
Steve: "THE TONIGHT SHOW" WITH SEAMUS O'FUELLON.
Jimmy: SEAMUS O'FUELLON. OH. THEY RUN OUT OF BREATH. "THE TONIGHT -- THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING SEAMUS O'FUELLON." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: TONIGHT.
Jimmy: IT'S TONIGHT.
Steve: IT'S GOING TO BE A A SPECTACLE.
Jimmy: I KNEW A GUY WHO USED TO -- I USED TO BE AN ALTAR BOY. I KNEW, LIKE, ALL THE PRIESTS. WE HAD TWO IRISH PRIESTS. THE ONE WOULD JUST RUN OUT OF BREATH SAYING THE PRAYERS. LIKE, HAIL MARY. AND THEN HE'D GO LIKE -- [ STAMMERING ] [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, IS HE DOING MORSE CODE? I HAVE NO IDEA. HE'D RING THE BELL. [ STAMMERING ] WE HAD FATHER McFADDEN. WE USED TO CALL FATHER McQUICK. AND HE WAS THE BEST BECAUSE YOU'D JUST BE IN AND OUT OF MASS IN TWO SECONDS. HE WAS LIKE -- [ MUTTERING ] SOMEONE RANG A BELL. AND HE'S LIKE -- [ MUTTERING ] AND AT ONE POINT YOU ALMOST WENT LIKE THAT. LIKE, "TAKE CARE, EVERYBODY." IT WAS AWESOME. IT WAS PACKED. YOU WOULD NEED A TICKET TO GET IN.
Steve: THE BIBLE WOULD BE FLOATING, HE WAS GOING SO FAST.
Jimmy: IT'S SO FUN AND CRAZY OUTSIDE. AND EVERYONE -- SO FAR IT LOOKS PRETTY SAFE OUT THERE. WE'RE IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN, SO IT'S JUST PACKD WITH PEOPLE. THERE'S SO MANY GOOD BARS HERE IN NEW YORK TO GO TO.
Steve: OH, IT'S THE BEST BAR CITY IN THE WORLD.
Jimmy: IT REALLY IS UNBELIEVABLE. [ CHEERS ] OLD TOWN, MOLLY'S. THERE'S JUST SO MANY PLACES TO GO TO. I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO DO IT THIS YEAR. I MIGHT JUST SNEAK INTO ONE BECAUSE I HAVE -- [ TARIQ LAUGHS ] [ LAUGHTER ] TARIQ, WHY IS THAT SO FUNNY?
Tariq: I'M LAUGHING THAT YOU'RE NOT --
Jimmy: YOU'RE IN A GREAT MOOD TONIGHT, BUDDY.
Steve: IT'S THAT COFFEE IN HIS BEER WHEN HE'S DUNKING THAT DOUGHNUT.
Jimmy: YEAH, DUNKING THAT DOUGHNUT, MAN, YEAH. I'LL JUST STOP AND HAVE ONE, MAYBE. [ TARIQ LAUGHS ] [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, YEAH, ANYWAY. [ TARIQ LAUGHS ] UNBELIEVABLE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD? I WAS TALKING TO MY PARENTS OVER THE WEEKEND. I DO IT ONCE EVERY THREE MONTHS. NO, I TALK TO MY PARENTS ALL THE TIME. THEY WERE SAYING THAT THEY WERE HERE IN THIS STUDIO TO SEE "THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JOHNNY CARSON" IN THIS EXACT STUDIO IN 1971 OR '72. THEY WERE HERE. THEY WERE WAITING IN LINE TO COME INTO THE SHOW. AND THIS WOMAN IN FRONT OF THEM HAD A SUIT. AND THIS KID CAME OVER. HE'S LIKE, "MA, YOU GOT MY SUIT?" SHE'S LIKE, "OH YEAH, YEAH. DAVID, HERE'S YOUR SUIT." HE TOOK THE SUIT AND HE RAN OFF. SHE GOES, "MY SON'S GOING TO BE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT." AND HER KID WAS DAVID BRENNER. HE WAS AN AMAZING COMEDIAN. DAVID BRENNER, HE WENT ON TO DO OVER 150 APPEARANCES ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW."
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: I MEAN, AMAZING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'VE ONLY BEEN AROUND FOR A A MONTH. I WISH IT WAS ON THIS SHOW. BUT ANYWAYS, DAVID LOST HIS FIGHT WITH CANCER OVER THE WEEKEND. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY MY CONDOLENCES TO HIS WIFE AND HIS FAMILY. AND ON BEHALF OF "THE TONIGHT SHOW," I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU, DAVID, FOR ALL THE LAUGHS. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. HE'S ONE OF THE BEST. ONE OF THE BEST COMEDIANS. EVER. [ APPLAUSE ] WELL, WELCOME TO THE SHOW, YOU GUYS. IT'S MONDAY. WE'RE HAPPY TO BE BACK. WE HAVE SOME GREAT SHOWS COMING UP THIS WEEK. LENA DUNHAM AND GREG KINNEAR WILL BE HERE. AND ON THURSDAY -- [ APPLAUSE ] THURSDAY, WE HAVE CHELSEA CLINTON. BUT WE ALSO HAVE -- BILLY JOEL IS GOING TO TALK AND PERFORM.

Steve: IS IT REALLY?
Jimmy: THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO SAY. AND THEN --
Steve: DON'T DANCE.
Jimmy: IS THIS TRUE? IS HE COMING BACK, THIS GUY?
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: JEFF MUSIAL MAKES HIS FIRST "TONIGHT SHOW" APPEARANCE THIS FRIDAY WITH SOME OF HIS ANIMAL FRIENDS. I THOUGHT WE -- WE DON'T HAVE TO BOOK THIS GUY, RIGHT?
Steve: NO, HE'LL BE HERE.
Jimmy: WE'RE "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THAT'S THE GUY WHO USED TO COME ON "LATE NIGHT" ALL THE TIME.
Steve: HE'S COMING TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." WE'LL HAVE FUN. REMEMBER WE THREW THE SNAKE AT YOU, THE FAKE SNAKE?
Jimmy: YEAH, HE CAME OUT AND ALMOST GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK. HE THREW A FAKE SNAKE AT ME.

WE LOVE IT WHEN HE VISITS. THE GREAT JAMES SPADER IS HERE, YOU GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JAMES SPADER FROM "THE BLACKLIST!"

THEY'RE ALWAYS BOOKED AND DOING SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY'RE UBER FAMOUS AND JUST A GREAT, GREAT IRISH BAND. WE HAVE BLACK 47 ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S GOING TO BE FUN. I READ SOMETHING THAT REALLY DISTURBED ME THE OTHER DAY. AMERICAN KIDS ARE RANKED 30th IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF MATH SKILLS. AND SO -- AND NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW HOW TO TURN THIS THING AROUND. I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT TODAY'S KIDS JUST CAN'T RELATE TO OLD-FASHIONED THINGS LIKE NUMBERS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO WE'VE UPDATED MATH TO MAKE THE EQUATIONS ABOUT STUFF MODERN KIDS CAN RELATE TO IN A A NEW SEGMENT CALLED "POPULAR MATHEMATICS." HERE WE GO. ♪ POPULAR MATHEMATICS MATHEMATICS ♪
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR FIRST EQUATION HERE. IT'S A GOOD ONE FOR ST. PATRICK'S DAY. IF YOU TAKE A LEPRECHAUN AND IF YOU ADD NEWT GINGRICH, IT EQUALS E.L. FUDGE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? SEE HOW THAT WORKS? [ APPLAUSE ]

YOU HAVE THE HIPPEST MEN ON TELEVISION, I AM TELLING YOU.
Jimmy: THE ROOTS? YEAH, I'M VERY SPOILED. THEY'RE FUN.
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING AND MULTITALENTED. I'M TELLING YOU, A FEW WEEKS AGO I WAS WATCHING THE SHOW AND SAW AMIR AND TARIQ DO A SEGMENT FROM -- JUST A LITTLE SCENE FROM "THE BACHELOR." AND IT WAS WORD FOR WORD VERBATIM. JUST A SCENE LIFTED FROM "THE BACHELOR." AND I HAD NEVER SEEN "THE BACHELOR." BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING I NEED TO HAVE SEEN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT WAS BETTER THAN THE ACTUAL SHOW. IT WAS BETTER THAN THE ACTUAL SHOW.
IT WAS REALLY -- FOR ME, SINCE THE LAST REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES, THE DEBATES, I -- REALLY, IT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING I'VE SEEN ON TELEVISION. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. WELL, WELCOME TO THE FIRST "TONIGHT SHOW." WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE SET?
THIS IS GREAT.
Jimmy: IT'S FUN, RIGHT?
IT'S REALLY GREAT. WE CAN SEE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE BACK THERE NOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, WE CAN ACTUALLY -- WE CAN BE LIKE A LITTLE JAMES SPADER AND PUT YOU IN DIFFERENT SPOTS.
YEAH, OKAY.
Jimmy: YOU PROBABLY GREW UP IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS.
I DIDN'T GROW UP HERE.
Jimmy: YOU LIVED HERE.
I'VE LIVED HERE FOR SO MANY YEARS. I MOVED HERE WHEN I WAS 17 AND COVERED SO MUCH GEOGRAPHY HERE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IN THE CITY.
Jimmy: ST. PATRICK'S DAY MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
I MEAN, WHEN I MOVED HERE, IT WAS THE LATE '70s AND EARLY '80s, AND IT WAS MADNESS. I MEAN, IT WAS REALLY MADNESS ALL THE TIME. BUT ST. PATRICK'S DAY, FOR ME, HAD A VERY PARTICULAR RESONANT FEELING. I WAS LIVING AT THE TIME IN A A FIFTH FLOOR WALK-UP ON 86th STREET BETWEEN 2nd AND 3rd. AND THE ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE CAME TO A STUMBLING HALT ON MY BLOCK.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S WHERE IT ENDS.
THAT'S WHERE IT ENDS. AND I'M TELLING YOU, IT WAS JUST LIKE A BACCHANAL DOWN THERE. YOU KNOW, YOU'D GO OUT AT ANY TIME STARTING AFTER THE PARADE ENDED -- FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS THERE WAS JUST LIKE FISTFIGHTS AND ARGUMENTS AND VOMITING AND URINATING IN THE STREETS. I MEAN, IT WAS JUST CRAZINESS.
Jimmy: SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF MY FAMILY REUNIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY INTERESTING.
AND, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, 75% OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE PARTICIPATING WERE COPS AND FIREMEN. SO, I MEAN, WHO ARE YOU GOING TO TURN TO? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU CAN'T CALL THE COPS. THEY'RE RIGHT THERE. YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EVERYTHING. AND I LIKE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT DIFFERENT SUBJECTS, AND I LIKE TO PICK YOUR BRAIN. I'M THINKING ABOUT GETTING A A TRUCK.
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: NOW, WOULD YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GETTING A TRUCK?
I DO, I DO. I BOUGHT --
Jimmy: YOU DO?
YEARS AGO I BOUGHT A A FORD F-250.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S A REAL MAN'S TRUCK.
IT WAS A GREAT TRUCK. I HAVE A PLACE UP IN MASSACHUSETTS, A LOT OF WOODS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. WE HAD HURRICANES EVERY SO OFTEN. ANYWAY, I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK AND I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP. AND I ALWAYS LIKED USED CARS. I'VE ALWAYS BOUGHT USED CARS IN MY LIFE. THIS IS REALLY ONE OF THE FIRST VEHICLES THAT I BOUGHT BRAND NEW. AND I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP. AND I REMEMBERED WHEN I WAS A A KID, I ALWAYS WORKED A LOT OF ODD JOBS, MANUAL LABOR JOBS AND STUFF. AND THERE WAS A SUMMER JOB THAT I USED TO HAVE ALL THE TIME WAS LIKE LOADING -- THERE WAS THIS OLD BLUE PICKUP THAT THIS FAMILY THAT I WORKED FOR. AND I WAS CONSTANTLY HAVING TO MAKE DUMP RUNS, I MEAN, ALL THE TIME. LOADING CRAP IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK, GOING TO THE DUMP AND THEN UNLOADING ALL THE CRAP AT THE DUMP. SO I GOT TO THIS DEALERSHIP. AND SOMEBODY HAD TOLD ME THIS WAS POSSIBLE. I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS. AND I HAD HYDRAULIC -- I HAD THEM DISATTACH THE BED OF A A NORMAL F-250 AND THEN PUT A A HYDRAULIC ON IT. SO IT WAS A DUMP TRUCK. I HAD A DUMP TRUCK. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAD AN F-250 DUMP TRUCK.
Jimmy: THAT'S LIKE A BOY'S DREAM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
IT WAS SUCH A DREAM.
Jimmy: WHAT? HOW WOULD IT WORK?
THERE WAS LIKE A LITTLE KNOB DOWN BY THE DRIVER'S SEAT, LIKE HERE. AND SO I'D GO TO THE DUMP. I'D FILL THE TRUCK UP. THE SAME YEAR THAT I BOUGHT THE TRUCK, WE GOT HAMMERED BY HURRICANES. AND THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF TREES DOWN ON THE PROPERTY. SO I WAS OUT THERE WITH CHAINSAWS AND CUTTING UP TREES LOADING THEM INTO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. AND I'D GO TO THE DUMP AND I'D PULL UP. AND I'D LIKE -- I'D GO AND OPEN THE TAILGATE ON THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. THEN, I'D LIKE, TURN THE LITTLE KNOB NEXT TO THE DRIVER'S SEAT LIKE THAT. AND THE BACK WOULD GO UP LIKE THIS. AND THEN, YOU'D ACCELERATE REALLY FAST AND THE TRUCK WOULD TAKE OFF AND JUST DUMP IT.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT! ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S A KID'S DREAM.
Jimmy: A KID'S DREAM, RIGHT?
I GREW UP WITH THE SEARS ROEBUCK CATALOG. LIKE I LOVE --
Jimmy: OH, THE SEARS CHRISTMAS CATALOG.
NO, NO, LIKE THE REGULAR SEARS ROEBUCK CATALOG, WHICH WAS, AT THAT TIME WHEN I WAS A A KID -- WAS LIKE FOUR OR FIVE INCHES THICK, YOU KNOW. IT WAS LIKE A BIG THICK CATALOG. IT HAD EVERYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE. AND MY SEARS ROEBUCK CATALOG EVERY YEAR WAS SO SORT OF WORN AND TORN AND JUST -- YOU KNOW, THE LADIES' UNDERWEAR SECTION. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CAREFUL, NOW. YEAH, YEAH.
AND, LIKE, BB GUNS. THERE WERE THINGS I COVETED. I COVETED THE LADIES UNDERWEAR THING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, LIKE, BB GUNS, I ALWAYS WANTED A BB GUN AND WALKIE-TALKIES. I THOUGHT WALKIE-TALKIES WERE THE GREATEST THING EVER.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT WAS LIKE SO THE FUTURE. YOU'RE LIKE, OH, MY GOD!
AND THEN OTHER KID DREAM WAS LIKE A MINIBIKE. THEY HAD TWO MODELS OF MINIBIKES IN THE THING. YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE MOTOR -- AND I THOUGHT, "OH, MAN, THOSE ARE THE COOLEST THINGS." BOTH MY PARENTS WERE TEACHERS, AND THEY NEVER HAD TWO QUARTERS TO RUB TOGETHER. SO I NEVER GOT ANY OF IT.
Jimmy: YOU GOT THE CATALOG. THAT WAS A BIG PURCHASE RIGHT THERE. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
YEARS LATER, I'M LIVING IN NEW YORK AND I JUST FINISHED DOING A PICTURE AND I WAS SORT OF FLUSH. EVERY SPRING IN NEW YORK, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'LL START SEEING MOTORCYCLES ON THE STREETS AND STUFF WHEN THE WEATHER GETS NICE. AND I JUST FINISHED DOING A A PICTURE, STILL LIVING, BY THE WAY, UP ON 86th STREET. AND THERE WAS A BMW MOTORCYCLE DEALERSHIP LIKE A BLOCK AWAY FROM OUR HOUSE. AND I REMEMBER ONE SPRING, I JUST GOT MONEY IN MY POCKET. AND I THOUGHT, "YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS YEAR I'M GOING TO GO OUT AND GET THAT MOTORCYCLE. I'LL GET THAT MOTORCYCLE. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT." SO I WENT DOWN TO THE BMW PLACE. I BOUGHT THE MOTORCYCLE. I NEVER EVEN GOT MY LICENSE. YOU KNOW, I DROVE THE THING FOR, LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW, THREE WEEKS. I THINK I TOOK IT OUT, LIKE, FOUR TIMES. AND I'LL NEVER FORGET. I WAS RIDING THE THING, AND MY GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME WAS ON THE BACK. AND I'M RIDING UP THE NEW YORK STATE THRUWAY. AND I HAD GONE AND BOUGHT THE LEATHER JACKET AND HELMET AND LEATHER GLOVES. AND I'M, LIKE, RIDING MY BMW AND THINKING THIS IS THE GREATEST THING. AND I'M RIDING ALONG AND I LOOK -- WHEN I'M GOING ALONG AND I LOOK DOWN, STRAIGHT DOWN THROUGH THE HANDLEBARS. AND I'M LOOKING AT THE PAVEMENT PASSING UNDER ME AT 70 MILES AN HOUR. AND I THINK TO MYSELF, WHAT PART OF MY BODY IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO HIT THAT GOING AT THIS SPEED? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, IT'S LIKE WHAT ARE THE GLOVES GOING TO DO?
Jimmy: WHAT ARE THE LEATHER GLOVES GOING TO DO? [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
THERE'S NOTHING EXCEPTIONAL ABOUT IT AT ALL. AND I SOLD THE MOTORCYCLE. AND THEN A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE -- JERRY SEINFELD WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE, AND I WAS OUT YEARS, YEARS AFTER THAT. I NEVER DABBLED IN MOTORCYCLES AGAIN AND JUST STARTED BUYING OLD CARS, YOU KNOW. THEN YEARS LATER, I WAS OUT IN CALIFORNIA AND I WAS GOING TO VISIT JERRY. HE HAD A -- HE LOVES PORSCHES, AND HE HAS THIS GARAGE SPACE OUT IN SANTA MONICA WHERE HE STORED A COUPLE OF HIS CARS AND STUFF. I'M BEING DISCRETE, DOZENS. [ LAUGHTER ] IN ANY CASE, ANYWAY --
Jimmy: 8,000 CARS. ANYWAY.
ANYWAY, SO I WAS OUT THERE VISITING HIM ONE DAY. AND YOU KNOW, HE WAS MOVING SOME OF THE CARS AROUND, AND THERE WAS A GUY THERE. AND THEY WERE SORT OF MOVING STUFF AROUND. I'M STANDING AROUND. I'M SORT OF TALKING. AND I LOVED THOSE OLD PORSCHES THAT HE HAS AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW, I'M WATCHING THE CARS COMING IN AND OUT. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I SEE IN ANOTHER LITTLE GARAGE SPACE JUST DOWN THE WAY -- I SEE THE THING. IT COMES OUT AND, LITERALLY, IT'S LIKE IT'S GLOWING. IT'S A HONDA 50. LIKE LITTLE HONDA 50. THE MINIBIKE. IT'S THE MINIBIKE.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE ONE!
IT'S THE MINIMIKE.
Jimmy: WHAT DID YOU DO?
AND I SEE IT COMING OUT OF THE LITTLE GARAGE SPACE. AND THE GUY WAS JUST SORT OF PUSHING IT OUT, LIKE JUST GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO GET THE CARS MOVED AROUND. LIKE IT WAS JUST SORT OF IN THE WAY. AND I SEE IT COME OUT. IT LITERALLY WAS LIKE IT WAS GLOWING. IT WAS LIKE IT WAS ANGELIC. THERE WAS, LIKE, MUSIC SWELLING OR SOMETHING.
Jimmy: AHH!
THAT WAS THE MUSIC. IT WAS COMING OUT. AND I REALIZED, AFTER ALL THOSE DECADES -- I REALIZED, I JUST WANTED THE HONDA 50. I REALLY JUST WANTED THE MINIBIKE.
Jimmy: AND AFTER THAT A A WOMAN IN LINGERIE CAME OUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
TO THIS DAY, IT'S LIKE IF I HAD A HONDA 50 AND A BB GUN AND A WALKIE- TALKIE AND THE GIRL IN THE UNDERWEAR -- I COULD RIDE OFF INTO THE SUNSET.
Jimmy: WE LOVE YOU EVERY TIME YOU COME. COME BACK WHENEVER YOU WANT TO. WE LOVE YOU HERE. JAMES SPADER! "THE BLACK LIST" AIRS MONDAYS AT 10:00 P.M. KERMIT THE FROG JOINS US NEXT. COME ON BACK, EVERYBODY.

I WAS A PART OF THAT. YEAH, YEAH. WE WERE JUST SITTING AROUND BORED BACK IN THE JACK PAAR TIMES. WE DECIDED TO MAKE THOSE PIPES INTO MUPPETS. DO WE HAVE A PICTURE OF THAT MAYBE?
Jimmy: WE DO. THIS IS THE --
IT'S VERY COOL.
Jimmy: IT'S RIGHT OUT IN THE HALLWAY HERE. YOU CAN SEE IT IF YOU DO THE NBC TOUR.
IT'S LIKE CAVE PAINTINGS FOR ME.
Jimmy: YEAH. LIKE, SEE? SO THIS IS A CLOSET -- WE MADE IT A MUSEUM. I'LL GET YOU A BETTER PICTURE. THAT WAS A CLOSET. SO LOOK AT THE PIPES. THEY'RE ALL PAINTED.
AND THEY ALL HAVE MUPPETS.
Jimmy: WITH EYEBALLS --
AND FUR. YEAH.
Jimmy: ON THE BOTTOM IT SAYS "WITH LOVE, THE MUPPETS."
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THEY KEPT IT IN THIS CLOSET --
YEAH.
Jimmy: FOR -- OVER, YEAH.
A LONG TIME.
Jimmy: AND I USED TO GO AND LOOK AT THIS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW, I WOULD GO IN. AND I REMEMBER IT WAS, AT ONE POINT, IN MAX WEINBERG'S DRESSING ROOM.
WELL, YOU KNOW, JIMMY? I KIND OF CONSIDER YOU THE NEW KEEPER OF THE PIPES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I FIGURE YOU'RE GOING TO BE AROUND FOR A WHILE. I THINK IF YOU HAVE MUPPET PIPES, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING ELSE. I BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING BACK THERE. IS THERE A BOX?
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT'S A LITTLE GIFT. IT'S KIND OF HEAVY.
Jimmy: OKAY.
STAND BY.
Jimmy: IT REALLY IS HEAVY. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, IT IS. IT IS. JIMMY, THIS IS FOR YOU. I FIGURE IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE KEEPER OF THE MUPPET PIPES, WELL, YOU NEED ONE OF THESE.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS!

Jimmy: CONGRATS ON THAT.
THANK YOU. [ CHEERS ] THANK YOU, ALL. AWW, LISTEN. YEAH.
Jimmy: AND NOW, TELL EVERYONE WHAT IT'S ABOUT. BUT THE MUPPETS BASICALLY GO ON A WORLD TOUR. AND WE GET SORT OF SIDETRACKED BY AN EVIL FROG NAMED CONSTANTINE WHO PEOPLE SAY LOOK LIKE ME. I DON'T SEE THE RESEMBLANCE. YEAH, IT'S JUST PRETTY COOL.
Jimmy: AND YOU HAVE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE IN IT. OH, MY GOODNESS.

IT'S WONDERFUL THOUGH, OF COURSE.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TINA FEY. [ CHEERS ] I LOVE TINA FEY.
YEAH. DO YOU MIND IF I JUST -- I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY OUT THERE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A SCENE IN THAT MOVIE WHERE TINA AND I -- WE SORT OF ALMOST ENDED UP IN THE TABLOIDS. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT ANY MORE DELICATELY, BUT SHE LICKS ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WOW.
SHE DOES. SHE DOES. SHE LICKS ME RIGHT ON THE BACK. AND I WAS NAKED DURING THE SCENE. ALTHOUGH -- ALTHOUGH, I KEPT MY ROBE ON RIGHT UP TILL THE TIME WE ROLLED CAMERAS.
Jimmy: YOU'RE NAKED FOR MOST OF THE MOVIE.
I'M NAKED RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I AM -- I AM CONSIDERED --

YES, YES. BUT --
Jimmy: WELL, YOU'RE A FROG, SO YOU'RE ALLOWED. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT HAPPENS. TO BE FAIR, BY THE WAY, I DID SEE THAT SCENE WITH TINA. SHE LICKS YOUR BACK AND STICKS YOU TO A WALL.
SHE DOES.
Jimmy: SO YEAH.
YOU WORKED WITH TINA. DID SHE EVER DO THAT TO YOU?
Jimmy: NO, SHE DID NOT. SHE DID NOT ACTUALLY. AND HOW IS RICKY GERVAIS?
WELL, RICKY'S WONDERFUL.
Jimmy: HE'S ONE OF THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE.
HE BRINGS AN INCREDIBLE, EDGY SORT OF HUMOR TO THE MUPPETS BUT, I SHOULD TELL YOU, WE HAVE A CLIP I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SHOW. BUT LET ME SET IT UP.
Jimmy: SURE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
IT WAS A BAD DAY ON THE OLD MUPPETS SET. I HAD A FEW TOO MANY GRASSHOPPERS FOR LUNCH.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS.
IT DOES, IT DOES. AND I WAS HAVING TROUBLE REMEMBERING MY LINES. SO THERE WERE THESE PIGEONS. YOU'LL SEE THEM FLYING THROUGH THE BACK OF THE SHOT. AND -- EACH AND EVERY TIME, EACH AND EVERY TAKE, I KEPT BLOWING ALL MY LINES. AND THEY HAD TO RESET THE PIGEONS AND -- EVERY TIME THE PIGEONS WERE PERFECT. SO AFTER ABOUT FIVE TAKES OF ME TRYING TO LIST THE NORTHERN INDUSTRIAL TOWNS OF GERMANY -- RICKY LEANS OVER TO ME AND HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW, KERMIT, EVERY TAKE, EVERY SINGLE TAKE, THOSE BIRDS FLY. THEY FLAP THEIR WINGS AND THEY GO UP INTO THE AIR, AND THEY ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING AMAZING. THEY CAN FLY THROUGH THE AIR. AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET YOUR LINES." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO.
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO. ANYWAY, THAT'S RICKY. AND WE ALL LAUGHED. AND I SCREWED IT UP AGAIN.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW -- I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE THE CLIP OF THE SCENE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.
YES.
Jimmy: AND GETTING YOUR LINES RIGHT.
OKAY.
Jimmy: IT'S KERMIT THE FROG IN "MUPPETS MOST WANTED." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
