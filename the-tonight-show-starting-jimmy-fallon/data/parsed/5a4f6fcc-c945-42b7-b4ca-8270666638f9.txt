Jimmy: OH! HEY! THAT'S A HOT CROWD RIGHT THERE. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. THIS IS IT. "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU ALL LOOK GREAT. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. THE RACE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IS STARTING TO GET PRETTY SERIOUS. IN FACT I SAW THAT JETS OWNER WOODY JOHNSON WAS NAMED THE NATIONAL FINANCE CHAIRMAN FOR JEB BUSH'S CAMPAIGN. WHEN ASKED WHICH CAMPAIGN HE WAS JOINING, JOHNSON WAS LIKE, "J-E-B-S! JEB'S! JEB'S! JEB'S!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] INTERESTING.
Steve: OH!
Jimmy: SOME MORE ELECTION NEWS. LOUISIANA GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL ANNOUNCED HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT YESTERDAY. THAT'S RIGHT. AND I SAW THAT HE PROMISED HIS KIDS THAT IF HE WINS, THEY CAN HAVE A PUPPY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT GOT AWKWARD WHEN HIS KIDS WERE LIKE, "GOLDFISH IT IS." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT NICE. THAT'S NOT NICE TO YOUR DAD.
Steve: THAT'S NOT SUPPORTIVE.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, BOBBY JINDAL ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, WHICH MAKES HIM THE 13th REPUBLICAN TO ENTER THE RACE SO FAR. THAT'S RIGHT. THIRTEEN REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, OR AS THAT'S ALSO CALLED, "A BANKER'S DOZEN." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: COME ON!
Jimmy: SURE, WHY NOT?
Steve: COME ON, THAT'S A A GOOD ONE.
Jimmy: WHY NOT? YEAH. THEY'RE NOT ALL THAT GOOD. YEAH, I GOT SOME CLUNKERS IN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SHOULD ENJOY THAT JOKE, YEAH. YEAH, EXACTLY. THAT'S RIGHT, BOBBY JINDAL'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT DESPITE A A NOTABLE DROP IN POPULARITY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. IT'S NOT GOOD. I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE POLL NUMBERS. THERE IS BOBBY JINDAL. HE IS ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS POPULAR THAN LEMON-FLAVORED JOLLY RANCHERS. [ LAUGHTER ] LITTLE BIT LESS.
Steve: JUST A LITTLE BIT LESS.
Jimmy: A LITTLE BIT, YEAH. HE'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN GETTING A FACEBOOK FRIEND REQUEST FROM YOUR BOSS. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S ALSO LOWER THAN BURNING THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH ON A HOT POCKET AND REALIZING THAT SAME HOT POCKET IS ICE COLD INSIDE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] HE'S VERY UNPOPULAR RIGHT NOW. NOT COOL. OH, EVERYONE, HERE'S THE LATEST ON THOSE TWO ESCAPED PRISONERS FROM UPSTATE NEW YORK. I GUESS OFFICIALS ARE NOW WORRIED THAT THE PAIR MAY HAVE SPLIT UP. THAT'S RIGHT LADIES, THEY'RE SINGLE! [ LAUGHTER ] SOME TV NEWS, HERE. HOWARD STERN ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT HE WILL NOT BE RETURNING FOR SEASON 11 OF NBC'S "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT." [ AUDIENCE AWS ] WHEN ASKED WHY HE WAS NOT RETURNING TO "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT," HE WAS LIKE, "BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT IT DOESN'T." [ LAUGHTER ] CHECK THIS OUT, ONE DIRECTION JUST INTRODUCED A NEW FRAGRANCE, WHICH HARRY STYLES CALLS, QUOTE, "A BIT MORE GROWN UP." IT'S STILL PRETTY CREEPY IF IT'S WORN BY AN ACTUAL GROWN UP. IT'S LIKE, "I ALWAYS JUST FELT A CONNECTION WITH THOSE REALLY YOUNG BRITISH BOYS. I WANT TO SMELL LIKE THOSE LITTLE BOYS." [ LAUGHTER ] "WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M UNDER ARREST?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LISTEN TO THIS. IN A NEW INTERVIEW, KANYE WEST SAID THAT HE DOESN'T WANT FANS TO THINK OF HIM AS A GOD OR A A KING. AND INSTEAD LOOK AT HIM AS, QUOTE, "THE MAID THAT CLEANS YOUR HOUSE." NOW LOOK, I REALIZE YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT KANYE WEST IN A MAID UNIFORM RIGHT NOW, BUT DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT. LISTEN TO THE JOKE I'M ABOUT TO TELL AND STOP IMAGINING KANYE WEST WEARING A MAID UNIFORM USING A FEATHER DUSTER TO DUST OFF THE BOOKSHELF. DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT. RIGHT, QUEST?
Questlove: YEAH, RIGHT, JIMMY. LISTEN TO WHAT HE'S SAYING. DON'T LET YOUR MIND WANDER AS YOU PICTURE KANYE WEST WEARING A BLACK AND WHITE ONE PIECE DRESS, POLISHING THE SILVER BEFORE THE GUESTS ARRIVE FOR THE SOIREE. RIGHT, MARK?
Mark: THAT'S RIGHT, QUEST. STOP THINKING ABOUT KANYE WEST SERVING TEA IN THE DRAWING ROOM WEARING A WHITE LACE HALF APRON, HIGH HEELS AND A RUFFLED HEADPIECE. RIGHT, JAMES?
James: RIGHT, MARK. QUIT PICTURING A FEMININE, FRENCH VERSION OF KANYE WEST SAYING, "OOH LA LA! JE T'AIME. SIL VOUS PLAIT?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: STOP THINKING ABOUT THAT, OKAY? STOP THINKING ABOUT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T THINK ABOUT KANYE WEST AS A SEXY FRENCH MAID, ALL RIGHT? STOP IT.
Announcer: STOP THINKING ABOUT FRENCH MAID KANYE WEST. A MESSAGE FROM THE STOP THINKING ABOUT FRENCH MAID KANYE WEST FOUNDATION. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT THAT. GET IT OUT OF YOUR MIND. THIS GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE EXCITED. THE CAR COMPANY LEXUS HAS JUST RELEASED A VIDEO THAT TEASES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REAL LIFE HOVERBOARD. YEAH. IN FACT A FEW PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY TRIED IT OUT. HERE'S WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. THIS FIRST PERSON SAID, "IT'S SO MUCH FUN." NEXT PERSON SAID," I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS REALLY EXISTS." NEXT PERSON SAID, "IT WAS JUST THE THING I NEEDED TO GET AWAY FROM 1950s BULLIES WHO WERE TRYING TO STOP MY PARENTS FROM HAVING SEX." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT PERSON SAID, "FEELS LIKE I'M FLYING." AND FINALLY, THIS NEXT PERSON SAID, "THAT PROBABLY SOUNDED WEIRD. I CAN EXPLAIN. FIRST I WENT BACK IN TIME. I ACCIDENTALLY KEPT MY DAD FROM SPYING ON MY MOM WHILE SHE WAS NAKED AND THEN MY MOM TRIED TO HAVE SEX WITH ME, SO I HAD TO PLAY GUITAR AT PROM TO MAKE THEM HORNY SO MY FINGERS WOULDN'T DISAPPEAR." THERE YOU GO. THAT SETTLES EVERYTHING. [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS COOL. I SAW THAT GOOD HUMOR IS BRINGING BACK ITS ICE CREAM TRUCKS THIS SUMMER AFTER ALMOST 40 YEARS. [ APPLAUSE ] YEAH. SO I GUESS THAT MAKES TWO THINGS THAT CHRIS CHRISTIE WILL BE RUNNING FOR THIS SUMMER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HEY! OH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH MAN, THIS IS NOT GOOD. THERE IS AN EXOTIC FISH NATIVE TO THE AMAZON THAT WAS ACTUALLY FOUND IN A LAKE IN NEW JERSEY THIS WEEK. OKAY? IT'S PRETTY SCARY LOOKING. JUST CHECK OUT WHAT IT LIKES TO EAT. JAW MUSCLES ALLOW THEM TO CRACK OPEN TREE NUTS AND OTHER TOUGH AQUATIC FOODS. SOMEWHAT TERRIFYINGLY, HOWEVER, THE FISH HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO MISTAKE HUMAN TESTICLES FOR TREE NUTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. SOMEWHAT TERRIFYINGLY? NO LADY, THAT IS MAX TERRIFYINGLY. TREE NUTS.
Steve: TREE NUTS. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT THEY CALLED THEM.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND FINALLY, THIS IS KIND OF INTERESTING. NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT WATCHING CAT VIDEOS ONLINE CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE YOUR ENERGY AND IMPROVE YOUR MOOD. WE HERE AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW" PUT IT TO THE TEST AND WE EDITED A FEW CAT VIDEOS INTO THE MOST BORING THING THAT WE COULD FIND. SEE IF THEY STILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
BACK IN APRIL THE FINANCE COMMITTEE CAME TOGETHER. IT WAS EVERYONE'S GOAL AT THAT TIME TO CONSIDER ALL OF THOSE BILLS AND TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF PASSING THE SIGNIFICANT TRADE AGENDA. IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR MOST ON MY SIDE TO SWALLOW. THAT'S OKAY. NOT EVERY PLAN TURNS OUT PERFECTLY EVERY TIME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: HAVE YOU HAD A FEW BEFORE THIS? [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE SUPER BOWL BEFORE.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU WERE SAYING TO HIM HERE?
SOMETHING ABOUT HIS BLUE EYES, I THINK. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, NO, I WAS TELLING HIM LITERALLY, "NOW YOU HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED THE GREATEST." AND HE'S SO HUMBLE BECAUSE OF CAMERAS WATCHING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO HE'S LIKE, "NO, NO, NO, NO." AND OF COURSE, TALKED ALL THAT SMACK AFTER.
Jimmy: BUT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO A SUPER BOWL BEFORE?
NO, BECAUSE IF THEY LOST, I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT. AND YOU SAW HOW CRAZY THE GAME WAS. THEY SHOULD HAVE LOST THAT GAME. IF IT WASN'T FOR PETE CARROLL, LIKE, GIVING US THE GAME BACK. I LOVE PETE CARROLL, BY THE WAY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
HE WASN'T A GOOD PATRIOTS COACH, BUT HE SURE IS A GOOD SEAHAWKS COACH. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS GIVE MARSHAWN LYNCH THE BALL, AND IT WAS OVER.
Jimmy: I KNOW, SERIOUSLY THOUGH, WE HAVE PEOPLE ON OUR STAFF THAT WERE ALSO ROOTING FOR SEATTLE AS WELL, AND THEY JUST MELTED. I MEAN, IT WAS NOT FUN. WE DID THE SHOW LIVE.
WE WERE IN THE OWNER'S BOX. THEY WON. WE ALL STARTED CELEBRATING WITH MR. KRAFT AND HIS WHOLE FAMILY. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THERE'S THAT TIP PASS, AND WE THINK IT'S A MISS. THE GUY GETS UP AND TRIES TO RUN. AND, LIKE, EVERYBODY NOW IS COMPLETELY DEVASTATED.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S. YOU RUN OUT OF ENERGY WHEN YOU GO DO THESE THINGS. YOU GO TO THESE PARTIES AND YOU GO --.
YEAH, LITERALLY, I'VE HAD SUPER BOWL PARTIES AT MY HOUSE. AND WHEN THEY LOST, EVEN WHEN PEOPLE WERE ROOTING FOR THE PATRIOTS, I JUST KICK THEM OUT. I LITERALLY KICKED EVERYBODY OUT OF MY HOUSE. AND MY WIFE IS LIKE, "CALM DOWN, IT'S JUST A GAME." I GO, "WHAT THE -- DO YOU KNOW?" I, LIKE, CURSED AT HER. THANK GOD, VALENTINES DAY FALLS RIGHT AFTER THE SUPERBOWL. A COUPLE EXPENSIVE GIFTS LATER, I'M ALLOWED BACK IN THE HOUSE.
Jimmy: YOU SAY YOU'RE SORRY, EXACTLY. THAT'S TOO MUCH STRESS FOR ME TOO. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, AND YOUR KIDS. ARE THEY PLAYING SPORTS NOW, TOO?
YEP, MY TWO SONS ACTUALLY WENT TO THE GAME WITH ME. MY SON IS PLAYING FOOTBALL.
Jimmy: DID THEY MEET TOM BRADY?
YEAH, THEY MET TOM A COUPLE OF TIMES. MY OLDEST SON, ACTUALLY, ONE OF THE GREATEST EXPERIENCES THAT WE'VE EVER HAD TOGETHER AS FATHER AND SON. WE WENT TO THE PATRIOTS GAME THE YEAR BEFORE IN FOXBOROUGH WHERE THEY PLAYED THE TEX AND I TOOK HIM IN THE LOCKER ROOM. HE MET TOM WARMING UP BEFORE THE GAME. TOM ASKED HIM HOW MANY TOUCHDOWNS HE WANTS. HE SAID, "FOUR." HE'S LIKE, "THAT'S IT?" HE'S LIKE, "THAT'S A LOT OF TEXANS. AND WE DIDN'T GET HOME UNTIL THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, WE WERE PLAYING FOOTBALL. COACH GAVE HIM THE GAME BALL, THE LOCKER ROOM WITH THE TEAM AFTER. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. AND THEN WE GET INTO THE HOUSE. WE'RE IN THE HOTEL, WE'RE PLAYING FOOTBALL. WAKE MY WIFE UP. I HAD A FEW TOO MANY TO DRINK BUT IT WAS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.
Jimmy: WELL, WE WERE TALKING. SO "TED 2" IS COMING OUT. MOVIE AS WELL?
Jimmy: THIS IS THE THING, I DON'T WANT TO RUIN ANYTHING FOR ANYONE. I SAW THE MOVIE, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MOST TALKED ABOUT SCENES, MAYBE IN THE HISTORY OF ANY COMEDY, BUT TOM BRADY IS ACTUALLY IN THIS MOVIE --
YES.
Jimmy: GOSH. I DON'T KNOW, YOU MUST TALKED HIM INTO DOING THIS.
YOU KNOW WHAT? HE SAW THE FIRST MOVIE. HE ACTUALLY CAME TO THE SET OF THE FIRST MOVIE. WE WERE DOING SOME ADDITIONAL SHOOTING. AND I WOULD TRY TO LIKE. I WAS ALL EXCITED ABOUT IT, I WAS TRYING TO PITCH HIM ON A A MOVIE ABOUT A GUY AND A A TALKING TEDDY BEAR AND HE WAS LIKE, "OH, YEAH, THAT SOUNDS EVERYBODY ELSE, "THIS SOUNDS RIDICULOUS." BUT THEN HE SAW THE MOVIE, LOVED IT. AND THEN I CALLED HIM, AND I TOLD HIM WHAT THE SCENE WAS. IN. SO, WE DO. WE TRY TO STEAL TOM'S SPERM IN HIS SLEEP. BECAUSE WE THINK IF WE WANT TO CREATE THE ULTIMATE BABY.
Jimmy: NO SPOILERS BUT, YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS, YEAH.
YOU KNOW IT IN THE COMMERCIAL ANYWAY, BUT YEAH, IT'S AN AMAZING SCENE. IT'S ONE OF THOSE SCENES --.
Jimmy: AND HE'S REALLY FUNNY.
THAT AND THE FERTILITY CLINIC ARE GONNA GO DOWN.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S OFF THE CHAIN. THAT'S SETH MCFARLANE, LIKE, PLAYS OUT. AND WE HAVE. AMANDA SEYFRIED IS NOW IN THE FILM AS WELL, AND SHE PLAYS THE LAWYER. BECAUSE THE WHOLE PLOT OF THIS IS TED WANTS TO HAVE A BABY.
YES, AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH TED WANTING TO HAVE A BABY IS THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE A PENIS SO --.
Jimmy: THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR, BIG PROBLEMS.
YEAH, NOT HAVING A -- COULD BE A PROBLEM. HE'S GOTTA FIGURE THAT OUT, BUT THEN WE WANT TO FIND A GREAT SPERM DONOR, TOM BRADY, YOU KNOW, IS NOT INTO IT. SAM JONES, WHO PLAYS FLASH GORDON, DOESN'T HAVE ANY LEFT.
Jimmy: FLASH GORDON, I LOVE HIM.
SO THEN, I OFFER IT UP. I SAID, "LOOK, I'M NOT A A SUPERHERO OR AN NFL MVP, BUT I WOULD DO IT FOR YOU." AND THEN SOMETHING HORRIBLY GOES WRONG AT THE FERTILITY CLINIC -- AND THEN, SO WE DECIDE WE WANT TO ADOPT. AND THEY SAY, "WELL, YOU CAN'T ADOPT. YOU'RE NOT A PERSON." SO WE DECIDE, "WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO SUE THE GOVERNMENT. WE'RE GONNA FIGHT FOR HIS CIVIL RIGHTS." AND SO THERE'S A NICE MESSAGE THERE ABOUT EVERYBODY BEING TREATED EQUALLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHICH IS GOOD. MOVIE WITH A MESSAGE, BUT IT'S NOT HEAVY HANDED.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT STILL GETS THE POINT ACROSS.
Jimmy: AND AMANDA SEYFRIED IS --
AND MORGAN FREEMAN.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. MORGAN FREEMAN IS AMAZING. OH, GOSH. TO GO -- HIMSELF, WHICH WAS -- YOU CAN BLEEP THAT, RIGHT? WE'RE NOT LIVE. CAN YOU BLEEP THAT? [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T DO IT IN THE SAME SENTENCE AS MORGAN FREEMAN. IT'S AN NBC RULE. YEAH, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY THAT. NO.
I TELL YA, WHEN I SAID IT TO HIM, THE FIRST TIME I'M LIKE -- AND HE'S LIKE, "WHAT?" I'M LIKE, "I'M SORRY." I WAS ALREADY IN A HOSPITAL BED, BUT IT'S AMAZING. HE'S SUCH A GOOD SPORT IN IT. EVERYBODY REALLY, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH KIND OF MAKING FUN OF THEMSELVES, BUT IN A WAY THAT, YOU KNOW, IS NOT OFFENSIVE.
Jimmy: AND AMANDA SEYFRIED'S NAME IS, I SHOULD SAY IS "SAM L. JACKSON."
SAM L. JACKSON.
Jimmy: THAT'S HER NAME -- SAM JACKSON.
THE GREAT RUNNING JOKE WITH HER IS THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT POP CULTURE. AND WE DON'T ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING BUT POP CULTURE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT WE HAVE THAT COMMON BOND AND THAT LOVE AND AFFINITY FOR MARIJUANA, SO WE'RE DESTINED TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER. IT'S, LIKE, A GREAT COUPLE.
Jimmy: IT'S A TRULY, TRULY FUNNY MOVIE, AND I WILL SAY ALSO THAT THE BUSBY BERKELEY DANCE SCENE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE IS, LIKE, OLD SCHOOL CINEMA MASTERPIECE. I TOLD SETH AND HE'S LIKE "AW, THAT'S GREAT", BECAUSE I KNOW HE HAD TO FIGHT TO GET THAT THING IN.
OH, MY GOD, DID HE HAVE TO FIGHT.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,  CF2 AND IT WAS ALSO MENTIONED TODAY IN THE REVIEWS. PEOPLE LOVED IT. AND PEOPLE OVERSEAS LOVE IT AND GET IT.
Jimmy: I THI THIS YEAR, THAT WILL IF NOT NOMINATED, IT WILL BE IN THE CLIPS OF MOVIES.
I WOULDN'T HOLD OUR BREATH TO GET NOMINATED.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT, THAT SCENE MIGHT BE IN A A MONTAGE.

HELLO! HI!
Jimmy: GOOD TO SEE YOU BUDDY.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. I WANTED TO ASK YOU, HOW'S GRANDMA DOING?
SHE'S DOING GOOD.
Jimmy: YEAH.
GOOD. GOOD. I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO, BECAUSE LAST TIME I WAS ON YOUR SHOW I MENTIONED THAT I MET HILLARY CLINTON AGAINST HER WISHES.
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T WANT GRANDMA TO FIND OUT THAT YOU MET HILLARY CLINTON.
YEAH, AND SHE FOUND OUT, AND SHE HAD SOME WORDS. BUT, SHE SAYS SHE'S GIVEN UP ON ALL POLITICIANS. SO IT'S OKAY. I'M IN THE CLEAR.
Jimmy: HOW OLD IS GRANDMA?
GRANDMA IS -- OOH, SORRY, GRANDMA, I DON'T KNOW. 77?
Jimmy: 77, YEAH. AND YOU JUST TOOK HER ON A A TRIP.
YEAH, I TOOK MY WHOLE FAMILY. MY WHOLE EXTENDED FAMILY TO A A EUROPEAN VACATION.
Jimmy: THAT'S FUN.
YEAH. WE WERE THERE FOR TWO WEEKS. WE ALL LIVED IN THE SAME LITTLE TINY HOUSE TOGETHER, AND NO FIGHTS, WHICH WAS GREAT.
Jimmy: WHAT?
YEAH, IT WAS A MIRACLE.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS.
GRANDMA ALMOST GOT US KICKED OUT OF A FEW PLACES.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, WE WERE AT THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES.
Jimmy: WOW.
AND WE WERE IN THE HALL OF MIRRORS. AND SHE WHIPPED OUT A SANDWICH AND DIET COKE FROM HER PURSE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S SUCH A GRANDMA MOVE, I LOVE IT.
AND THIS WOMAN COMES UP AND SAID, "MADEMOISELLE, YOU CANNOT EAT IN HERE, IT'S THE HALL OF MIRRORS," AND SHE GOES, "WATCH ME." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I WAS LIKE, "OH, SHE'S SENILE, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT."
Jimmy: IS SHE SENILE?
NO, NO. SHE'S MUCH SHARPER THAN I AM. BUT THEN SHE'S LIKE "DON'T WORRY, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF BETTER PLACES THAN THIS." [ LAUGHTER ] THAN THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES.
Jimmy: REALLY HARD TO DO.
YEAH, I KNOW, IT'S A TALENT. YEAH.
Jimmy: HAS SHE BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY BEFORE?
NO, NO. IN FACT, I ACTUALLY HAD TO GET HER PASSPORT FOR THE FIRST TIME. SHE WAS BORN IN 1938, I BELIEVE. SO WE HAD TO CALL THIS REALLY, REALLY SMALL TOWN IN OKLAHOMA WHERE SHE WAS BORN TO GET HER BIRTH CERTIFICATE. AND WE FOUND OUT THAT HER NAME WAS SPELLED WRONG ON HER BIRTH CERTIFICATE. I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE'S MANAGED TO GET BY ALL THESE YEARS.
Jimmy: WHAT IS HER NAME? HER NAME IS FONDA, BUT THE DOCTOR WROTE FRENDA ON THE -- [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH.
Jimmy: FRENDA?
FRENDA LAFFAY WAS HER NAME ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
Jimmy: FRENDA LAFFAY.
SO WE KEPT CALLING HER FRENDA THE ENTIRE TRIP, WHICH JUST PISSED HER OFF.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT YEAH, AS I WAS LIKE I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THAT HAPPENED. BUT SHE WAS LIKE "ALL THE DOCTORS WERE DRUNK BACK THEN." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I GUESS SO. YEAH. I GUESS SO. HOW'D THE PETS DO? I KNOW YOU HAVE A DOG AND A A CAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T BRING THEM, NO.
NO. NO. I MEAN, I TRIED. BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. THEY DID GOOD. MY CAT IS A LITTLE -- THINGS ARE A LITTLE ROUGH AT HOME RIGHT NOW BECAUSE MY CAT IS ON A DIET RIGHT NOW. AND HE'S NOT BEEN TAKING IT WELL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BRIAN, RIGHT?
BRIAN, YEAH. HIS NAME IS BRIAN. HE TOOK OFF HIS COLLAR AND BURIED IT IN HIS LITTER BOX, WHICH I THINK WAS AN ACT OF PROTEST. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE WAS LIKE "YOU DON'T CONTROL ME."
YEAH, NO, NO. AND THEN THE POOR DOG. EVERY TIME THE CAT WALKS BY THE DOG, HE JUST WALKS UP AND SMACKS HIM FOR NO REASON. IT'S BECAUSE HE'S HUNGRY, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: HE'S STARVING BECAUSE HE'S ON A DIET. PLUS YOU BROUGHT A VIDEO.
I DID. OF THEM PLAYING.
Jimmy: HERE'S BRIAN AND THE DOG. ♪♪
Jimmy: DID YOU PUT THIS MUSIC TOGETHER, TOO? I LOVE THAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ] JUST PLAYING, HAVING A GOOD TIME.
THEY'RE JUST PLAYING. JUST PLAYING.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS BOOK SERIES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jimmy: THIS IS SO IMPRESSIVE, I LOVE THIS. "THE LAND OF STORIES," THIS IS THE FOURTH ONE.
FOURTH ONE IN THE SERIES.
Jimmy: DID YOU EVER THINK THAT YOU'D BE WRITING ALL THESE BOOKS?
NO. GOSH, NO. I ORIGINALLY JUST DID THE ONE JUST TO GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD, AND THEN IT BECAME A REALLY SUCCESSFUL SERIES.
Jimmy: I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE'S DONE THIS.
YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S CRAZY.
Jimmy: KIDS LIKE JUMPING INTO THE WORLD OF STORY BOOKS.
YEAH, YEAH, IT'S ABOUT TWINS THAT GO INTO THE FAIRY TALE WORLD AND THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF ADVENTURES AND MEET ALL KINDS OF CRAZY PEOPLE. THERE NOT AS EXPECTED. LIKE, MOTHER GOOSE THEY MEET IS AN ALCOHOLIC. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU ALWAYS FIGURED. YEAH. THIS IS THE -- THE OTHER ONES WERE NUMBER ONE ON "THE NEW YORK TIMES" BESTSELLER LIST.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: THE OTHER ONE'S NUMBER TWO. I MEAN THESE ARE LIKE THE BIGGEST.
OH, MY GOD, YEAH.
THE BIGGEST BOOKS OUT THERE.
OH, THANK YOU, YEAH. AND IT'S BEEN GETTING TONS OF GREAT PRAISE. LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS LOVE IT, AND THEY'VE BEEN USING IT IN THE CLASSROOM. I GOT A LETTER FROM A LIBRARIAN A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT SAID THAT TWO KIDS GOT INTO A PHYSICAL FIGHT OVER THE BOOK IN HER LIBRARY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH, I DON'T CONDEMN VIOLENCE, BUT THAT'S PRETTY COOL.
Jimmy: YEAH. MUST HAVE BEEN A REALLY, YEAH. MUST HAVE BEEN A REALLY QUIET FIGHT.
YEAH, MUST HAVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SHH. BE QUIET, WE'RE FIGHTING. NOW WITH KIDS, YOU DO SIGNINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: DO KIDS COME UP TO YOU, DO THEY RECOGNIZE YOU FROM "GLEE"? "GLEE" FANS?
THAT'S THE CRAZY THING. IF SOMEONE IS ABOVE 14, OF COURSE THEY KNOW ME FROM "GLEE." BUT EVERY YOUNGER THAN THAT ONLY REALLY KNOWS ME AS THE "LAND OF STORIES" AUTHOR. AND I HAVE KIDS ALL THE TIME THAT COME UP TO ME AND SAY HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TOLD THAT YOU LOOK LIKE THAT GUY FROM TV?
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: NO WAY.
IT'S GREAT. IT'S TRIPPY.
Jimmy: WILD, AND DO THEY HAVE NOTES, DO KIDS COME AND GIVE YOU NOTES?
YES, THEY DO. YES, THEY COME. THEY SAY I DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS SENTENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THEY'LL TELL ME, LIKE. I HAD A LITTLE GIRL WHO SAID "YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK I'M TRYING TO READ BY MYSELF, AND YOU KEEP WRITING THINGS LIKE 'ON THE SOLDIER'S SHOULDERS' AND I CAN'T SAY THAT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD, YOU'RE TEACHING KIDS TO SIT DOWN AND READ. YOU GUYS, PICK UP THIS BOOK, IT'S FANTASTIC. "THE LAND OF STORIES: BEYOND THE KINGDOMS" IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR PRE-ORDER AND WILL BE IN STORES JULY 7th. YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, BUDDY.
