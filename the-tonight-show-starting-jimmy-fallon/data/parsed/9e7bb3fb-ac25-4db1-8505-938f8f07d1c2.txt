Jimmy: IT'S ANOTHER COOL MOVIE THAT YOU'RE -- YOU ALWAYS -- YOU PICK -- YOU DO THESE COOL MOVIES. I JUST LOVE 'EM. I'M SUCH A FAN OF YOURS.
THANKS.
Jimmy: AND SO THIS ONE HAS GOT A TRICKY THING. YOU'RE A SCIENTIST.
A MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST, YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, SORRY. WAS THAT SIMILAR?
I MEAN, KIND OF. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S, IT'S IN THE SAME VAIN.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD.
SAME FAMILY TREE.
Jimmy: DID YOU MEET ANY OF THESE MOLECULAR --
WE DID! MIKE CAHILL, THE DIRECTOR, ACTUALLY HIS BROTHER WENT TO JOHNS HOPKINS. SO, MICHAEL PITT AND I -- [ CHEERS ] WENT DOWN TO THE LAB AND WE PUT ON THE LAB COATS AND THE GLOVES AND WE LEARNED HOW TO SPLICE DNA.
Jimmy: NO.
YEAH. AND THAT -- I MEAN, THE BAD THING IS I ACCIDENTALLY BROKE SOMEONE'S THESIS EXPERIMENT. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] AND HE'D BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR TWO YEARS. [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: BRIT!
I KNOW! IT WAS REALLY BAD. IT'S THE ONLY THING I EVER FEEL I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD, NO!
HE PASSED IT TO ME AND I WAS LOOKING AT IT THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE. AND IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. I GOT REALLY EXCITED AND I TURNED TO PASS IT MICHAEL PITT AND -- I DROPPED IT. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO -- THAT HAPPENED. AND IT DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT IN THE FILM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT, WHAT HAPPENED?
I FEEL LIKE I'M CONFESSING RIGHT NOW.
BUT THEN I MADE IT UP TO HIM.
Jimmy: OKAY.
BECAUSE I WAS LIKE, I'M BASICALLY YOUR LAB SLAVE NOW. AND I JUST SPENT THE REST OF THE MONTH PIPEHEADING SALINE SOLUTION INTO TEST TUBES FOR HIM.
Jimmy: AND JUST HELPING HIM BACK OUT.
YEAH. HELPING HIM BACK OUT.
Jimmy: OOH, MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS.
IT WAS A ROUGH START. BEING A MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST, IT WAS A ROUGH START.
Jimmy: MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SCIENTISTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
MAYBE.
Jimmy: THEN, YOU WOULDN'T HAD THIS PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.
MAYBE -- MAYBE PHYSICS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR ME.
Jimmy: BECAUSE THE MOVIE IS ABOUT BASCIALLY -- THE DOCTOR -- HE SEES AN EYE -- AN EYE PATTERN.
IT'S COMPLICATED. [ LAUGHTER ] YES.
Jimmy: IT'S A VERY TRICKY THING.
YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU. AN EYE PATTERN THAT HE'S IN LOVE WITH?
BASICALLY, IT'S ABOUT -- DO YOU BELIEVE IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT?
Jimmy: YES.
REALLY?
Jimmy: SURE.
COOL. OKAY, I KIND OF DO TOO. BUT IN THIS FILM --
BRIT, I'M MARRIED.
RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, NO. IT WASN'T EVEN -- OF COURSE. YES.
Jimmy: I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS NOW.
IT'S COOL. SO BASICALLY -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S ABOUT MAYBE LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT BEING ACTUALLY LOVE AT RECOGNITION. WHETHER OR NOT YOU'VE ACTUALLY KNOWN THAT PERSON IN ANOTHER LIFETIME. AND SO THESE TWO MOLECULAR BIOLOGISTS USE THE IRIS PATTERN OF THE EYE TO TRACK SOULS THROUGH TIME TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND SOUL MATES IN FACT.
Jimmy: AH-HA! [ AUDIENCE OOHS ]
SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN.
Jimmy: YEAH-HA! HERE WE GO. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S BRIT MARLING IN "I ORIGINS."
