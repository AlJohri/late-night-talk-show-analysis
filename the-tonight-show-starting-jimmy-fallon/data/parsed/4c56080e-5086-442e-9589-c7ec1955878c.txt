Jimmy: IT'S BREAKING RECORDS, SHATTERING RECORDS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS.
TELL ME.
Jimmy: THEY'RE SELLING -- YOU CAN'T EVEN GET A TICKET TO IT.
WAIT. I NEED TO SEE IT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE IN IT.
YEAH, NO I KNOW, BUT DISNEY IS VERY STINGY. THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME TICKETS.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT TRUE. THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL. EVEN --
YOU BUY IT, TOO.
Jimmy: NO, BUT THIS IS THE FIRST DISNEY MOVIE THAT YOU ACTUALLY SEE YOU'RE FACE IN BECAUSE YOU WERE THE VOICE OF OLAF.
YEAH, YEAH, WHICH ORIGINALLY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A LIVE ACTION MOVIE WITH ME RUNNING AROUND IN A SNOWMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] MY DAUGHTERS FREAKED OUT WHEN THEY SAW ME IN "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" THE OTHER DAY BECAUSE ALL THEY'VE REALLY SEEN ME IN WAS THE SNOWMAN, OLAF, IN "FROZEN." AND SO THEY -- THEY SAW ME ON THE POSTER, AND IT TERRIFIED -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK IT'S TERRIFYING.
IT TERRIFIES THEM.
Jimmy: NO, HERE IT IS, JOSH GAD.
IT'S LIKE AN OVERWEIGHT JACK NICHOLSON. THEY -- [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHY I WAS CHANNELING JACK IN "THE SHINING," COME TO SEE MY MOVIE.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT BAD.
COME SEE MY FAMILY FILM.
Jimmy: HOPE YOU ENJOY IT. "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST."
YEAH, COME TO "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST." WHAT COULD GO WRONG? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DO THE KIDS GO TO THE PREMIERE, DID THEY SEE THE FILM?
IT WAS CRAZY. BECAUSE THEY -- AGAIN, THEY'VE NEVER SEEN ME ON THE BIG SCREEN. SO THEY KEPT LOOKING BACK AT ME, LOOKING AT THE SCREEN. IT WAS LIKE BLACK MAGIC. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW IS HE TELEPORTING?
Jimmy: NO, BUT SERIOUSLY, YOU SING, YOU DANCE, YOU DO MY FAVORITE SONG, WHICH IS GASTON.

Jimmy: NO PROBLEM.
THIS IS A LITTLE UPSETTING TO ME, SO WHAT I LEARNED, JIMMY FALLON, IS THAT -- JEWS DON'T RIDE HORSES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY, ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO COMMERCIAL.
YEAH, MY HORSE IS WHAT YOU MAY CALL AN ANTI-SEMITE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT IS NOT TRUE.

Jimmy: HORSES DON'T DO THAT.
NO. JIMMY, LET ME FINISH. [ LAUGHTER ] MY -- MY HORSE WAS -- HIS NAME WAS BUDDY WHICH IS A MISNOMER, BECAUSE HE'S A BASTARD.
Jimmy: HEY COME ON. HE'S A HORSE! WHY WAS HE SO --
NO, LITERALLY HE THREW ME OFF HIS BACK THE FIRST DAY. THEN LUKE AND I HAD TO RIDE INTO THE VILLAGE.
Jimmy: YOU WERE GREAT. I SAW THAT SCENE.
WELL THANK YOU, BUT IT'S ALL CGI. WE HAD TO RIDE INTO THE VILLAGE ON THESE HORSES TO SING "BELLE," THE SONG "BELLE." ON ACTION -- ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS TAKE THREE STEPS.

Jimmy: HERMIONE.
AND THEN -- AND THEN THE TRAINER, THE HORSE TRAINER -- THIS IS ALL TRUE -- THE HORSE TRAINER, LITERALLY, TEARS IN HIS EYES COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS, "SO SORRY. I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN BEFORE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL HE HADN'T SEEN IT HAPPEN BEFORE. WHATEVER THEY GOT, WORKED AND IT LOOKED REALLY GREAT.
