WE WERE ALSO GOING TO HAVE DONALD TRUMP AS WELL, BUT LAST TIME I CHECKED, HE WAS STILL GIVING HIS SPEECH. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S VERY INTERESTING. DID YOU SEE THIS? IN A SPEECH FROM TRUMP TOWER TODAY, DONALD TRUMP OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE ALSO IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE WAS ANNOUNCING.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW A CHEVROLET IN TOKYO. I HIRE PEOPLE, THEY DO A A WEBSITE, IT COSTS ME $3. THE SUN WILL RISE, THE MOON WILL SET. PEOPLE THAT KNOW ME LIKE ME. DOES MY FAMILY LIKE ME? I THINK SO. AND I PROMISE I WILL NEVER BE IN A BICYCLE RACE. I'M REALLY RICH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: HILLARY WOULD BE OUR FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT AND TRUMP WOULD BE OUR FIRST MADLIBS PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS. [ APPLAUSE ] WHAT IS HE SAYING? I THINK GARY BUSEY WROTE THAT SPEECH, ACTUALLY.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, TRUMP IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND HE'S WASTING NO TIME GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS. IN FACT, JUST AFTER HIS ANNOUNCEMENT, HE DEMANDED TO SEE JEB BUSH'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ISN'T THAT INTERESTING? SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS. I SAW THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN RELEASED A SPOTIFY PLAYLIST, WHICH INCLUDES, KELLY CLARKSON, KATY PERRY, ARIANNA GRANDE AND PHARRELL. IF HILLARY DOESN'T WIN THE ELECTION, SHE CAN ALWAYS GET A A JOB AS A BAR MITZVAH DJ. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S GOT SOME GOOD CHOICES. AND DURING THE SPEECH YESTERDAY, HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT SHE WANTS TO IMPROVE PRESCHOOLS, ADDING THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE A WAREHOUSE WHERE PEOPLE DEPOSIT THEIR KIDS. THAT BACK FIRED A LITTLE BIT WHEN PARENTS WERE LIKE, "SURE, SURE, SURE. BUT WHERE IS THAT KIDS WAREHOUSE AGAIN?" [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD NEVER DO THAT. JUST CURIOSITY'S SAKE, WHERE IS THIS? OF COURSE THE OTHER BIG STORY CONTINUES TO BE RACHEL DOLEZAL. YOU KNOW, THE NAACP PRESIDENT WHO WAS REVEALED TO BE A WHITE WOMAN. NOW HER BROTHER IS SAYING THAT HE KNEW ABOUT IT, BUT SHE ASKED HIM NOT TO BLOW HER COVER. UNFORTUNATELY HER COVER HER COVER HAD ALL READY BEEN BLOWN BY GOD WHEN HE MADE HER A A BLONDE-HAIRED, BLUE-EYED WHITE LADY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CHECK THIS OUT. THE CIA CELEBRATED ITS ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY ON TWITTER, LAST WEEK, BY POSTING A LIST OF FIVE REASONS WHY EVERYONE SHOULD FOLLOW THE ORGANIZATION. AND IF YOU WANT THE CIA TO FOLLOW YOU, JUST TWEET OUT "EDWARD SNOWDEN," "ISIS," "ANTHRAX." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY'LL FOLLOW YOU. YOU'LL HEAR FROM THEM, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

GAP ANNOUNCED IT WILL CLOSE 175 STORES IN NORTH AMERICA OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, DUE TO LAGGING SALES. YEAH. THEY SAY IT WILL TAKE AWHILE, BECAUSE EVERY TIME A STORE FOLDS, SOMEONE COMES ALONG, AND UNFOLDS IT, THEY HAVE TO KEEP REFOLDING. IT'S A NIGHTMARE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CVS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL BUY TARGET'S PHARMACY BUSINESS FOR ALMOST $2 BILLION. OF COURSE THEY'RE JUST BUYING IT SO NO ONE WILL NOTICE THEY'RE ALSO BUYING CONDOMS. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, I'LL TAKE THE PHARMACY BUSINESS, SOME GUM, AND MAYBE SOME CONDOMS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND BOOK OF SLOW COOKER RECIPES IS GOOD. THAT'S RIGHT CVS WILL BUY TARGET'S PHARMACY BUSINESS FOR ALMOST $2 BILLION. THE DEAL WILL BE DONE SOON, WHILE THE RECEIPT WILL FINISH PRINTING IN THREE YEARS. [ APPLAUSE ] WHAT IS THIS THING, I ONLY BOUGHT GUM. AND FINALLY BIG NEWS YESTERDAY, FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR JEB BUSH OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016. YOU KNOW, I WAS GOING TO MAKE A A JOKE ABOUT THIS STORY, I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS A JOKE. I THINK IT NEEDS A HARD-HITTING NEWS INTERVIEW. AND THAT NEWS INTERVIEW NEEDS TO BE SLOW JAMMED. YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT, TARIQ? [ APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: YEAH.
SHE DID IT WITHOUT TELLING ME. IT WAS LIKE, THANKS, MOM. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE USE TO THIS THOUGH.
Jimmy: YOU SENT A TWEET OUT THAT SAID WHAT DATE IS MOTHER'S DAY AGAIN? ASKING FOR A FRIEND. THAT'S WHAT MADE ME LAUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] THANKS, MOM, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
SHE'S COME AROUND, THANKFULLY.
Jimmy: YEAH. SHE WAS THERE. SHE WAS GREAT. EVERYONE GAVE YOU A STANDING OVATION, YOU SAID, "HEY MOM, CAN YOU TELL THEM TO PLEASE SIT DOWN?" AND THEN EVERYONE SAT DOWN. WHICH WAS VERY, VERY COOL. LET'S TALK, I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR WIFE. I WANT TO KNOW -- COLUMBA, IS YOUR WIFE?
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 41 YEARS.
41 YEARS. I MET HER -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: GOOD FOR YOU. ABSOLUTELY.
I MARRIED HER WHEN I 17 -- I MET HER WHEN I WAS 17, I MARRIED HER WHEN I WAS 21.
Jimmy: WHERE DID YOU MEET?
I MET HER IN LEON, MEXICO. I FELL IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. IT WAS ONE OF THESE DEALS. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAPPENED TO YOU JIMMY, BUT --
Jimmy: DEFINITELY DUDE, ABSOLUTELY.
MAN I JUST, IT WAS A KNOCK OUT MOMENT. IT WAS LIKE LIGHTNING HIT. I LOST 20 POUNDS, I WAS -- I PROBABLY WEIGHED 190 THEN. SO, I WAS LIKE A TOTAL. I COULDN'T SLEEP, I COULDN'T EAT. I WAS TOTALLY CONSUMED BY MY --
Jimmy: WHY WERE YOU THERE? AND WHERE DID YOU EXACTLY MEET?
I WAS BUILDING A SCHOOL HOUSE IN AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM OUTSIDE OF LEON FROM A SCHOOL HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
Jimmy: AS EVERY 17-YEAR-OLD KID DOES. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, THEY GO OUT AND BUILD A A SCHOOL HOUSE. YEAH.
I DID IT WITH A FEW PEOPLE. WE WEREN'T REALLY GOOD AT BUILDING THE SCHOOL. SO THANKFULLY THE FOLKS THAT WERE IN THE -- THIS IS THE RURAL AREA OF MEXICO.
Jimmy: YEAH. THEY KIND OF TOOK IT OVER WHEN THEY KNEW WE WERE SCREWING IT UP. BUT THEN WE BECAME THEIR LABORERS AND EFFECTIVELY BUILT A SCHOOL HOUSE. SO, I'M IN THAT PROCESS, AT THE VERY END I MET MY WIFE.
Jimmy: AND YOU SAID THAT'S THE ONE.
THAT'S IT.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. AND DID YOU KNOW HOW TO SPEAK SPANISH?
I WAS PRETTY, NOT SO HOT AT SPANISH, AND SHE WASN'T SO HOT IN ENGLISH. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE, YOU CAN OVERCOME THOSE BARRIERS PRETTY QUICK. THERE'S ANOTHER LANGUAGE THAT MATTERS THE MOST.
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE DONE SLOW JAMMING, OKAY! WE'RE DONE, WE'RE DONE, WE'RE DONE. [ LAUGHTER ] NO STOP. WE STOPPED SLOW JAMMING. GOSH. BUT DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH OR SPANISH WHEN YOU'RE AT HOME?
SPANISH MOST OF THE TIME, AND ALL THE TIME WHEN SHE'S MAD AT ME. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL THE TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. ALL THE TIME. YEAH.
I MEAN, I LISTEN IN SPANISH WHEN THAT'S HAPPENING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHICH IS VERY HARD TO DO. YEAH. NOW DURING THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN NOW, YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE COMPARED TO YOUR DAD AND YOUR BROTHER.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I MEAN, DO YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE YOURSELF?
YOU KNOW, IT'S COMPLICATED, 'CAUSE I LOVE THEM A LOT, I KNOW I'VE GOT TO DISTINGUISH MYSELF, THAT'S WHAT CAMPAIGNS ARE ABOUT. MY DAD IS THE MOST PERFECT MAN I'VE EVER MET. HE'S THE GREATEST MAN ALIVE SO HOW COULD I -- I MEAN IT'S LIKE IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN WORRY ABOUT THAT. THERE'S NO COMPARISON.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND MY BROTHER I WOULD SAY IS A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER ARTIST THAN I AM.
Jimmy: HE IS. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S PHENOMENAL, BY THE WAY. DID YOU KNOW HE COULD DO THAT?
I'M STILL DOING STICK DRAWINGS. [ LAUGHTER ] HE CAN ACTUALLY PAINT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
HE'S PHENOMENAL AT THAT.
Jimmy: HE'S PHENOMENAL. YEAH, I LOVE HIS PAINTINGS.
I'M A WHOLE LOT YOUNGER AND A LOT BETTER LOOKING.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ] I'LL TAKE THAT. QUICKLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE LOGO, 'CAUSE YOU RELEASED THE LOGO AS WELL.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND I JUST WANT KNOW, HOW DO I PRONOUNCE IT? DO I PRONOUNCE IT JEB! [ LAUGHTER ] DO I SHOUT IT? DID REGIS PHILBIN COME UP WITH THIS? JEB! JEB IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT 2016! JEB! [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
