Jimmy: OH, OH, OH! TONIGHT'S GOING TO BE FUN. I CAN FEEL IT. TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE FOR THE SHOW. HOW FUN, HOW EXCITING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. LOOKING GOOD. GOOD-LOOKING CROWD. GOOD-LOOKING CROWD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, EVERYBODY. OF COURSE, IT WAS LAST NIGHT'S DEBATES. WE HAD THE EARLIER DEBATE, THE SO-CALLED "KIDS TABLE DEBATE." AND THEY HAD THE MAIN EVENT WHERE THE TOP-TIER CANDIDATES DUKED IT OUT. ACTUALLY, THEY WERE EXCHANGING WORDS BEFORE THE DEBATE EVEN STARTED. I READ THAT DURING A RECENT CONVERSATION WITH THE REPUBLICAN DONOR, JEB BUSH REFERRED TO DONALD TRUMP AS "A BUFFOON, A CLOWN AND AN A-HOLE." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN TRUMP WAS LIKE, "THAT'S RIGHT, I'M TOTAL TRIPLE THREAT." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "DON'T FORGET IT." IT'S NO SURPRISE PEOPLE TOOK A A FEW SHOTS AT TRUMP AT THESE DEBATES. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE HE'S FIGHTING WITH EVERYONE. IN FACT, NOW HE'S SUING CELEBRITY CHEF JOSE ANDRES FOR BACKING OUT OF A RESTAURANT DEAL DUE TO TRUMP'S OFFENSIVE REMARKS ABOUT MEXICANS. AND TRUMP SAID HE DIDN'T NEED HIM ANYWAY. HE TOLD HIS ASSISTANT, "GET ME SEÑOR FROG." [ LAUGHTER ] NOT A REAL PERSON. [ APPLAUSE ] AND ONE OF THE CANDIDATES AT THE EARLY DEBATE, GEORGE PATAKI, SAID THAT HIS ROUTINE BEFORE EVERY DEBATE IS TO DRINK A DIET LEMON SNAPPLE ICED TEA AND PRAY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS ALSO THE ADVICE CHRIS CHRISTIE GETS FROM HIS DOCTOR. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: OH, HEY! OH! HEY, HEY, HEY!
Jimmy: NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT DEBATE, EVERYONE'S STILL CONCENTRATING ON RAISING MONEY. I SAW THAT JEB BUSH'S CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO RAISE MORE MONEY BY SELLING GUACAMOLE BOWLS -- [ LAUGHTER ] ON ITS WEBSITE FOR $75. $75 FOR A GUACAMOLE BOWL. EVEN CHIPOTLE WAS LIKE, "DAMN, SON." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "DAMN, SON." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: DAMN.
Jimmy: YOU REMEMBER WHEN JEB WAS ON OUR SHOW AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT GUACAMOLE?
Steve: OH, YEAH. HE DID NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: WELL I SAID, "DID YOU EVER HAVE PEAS IN YOUR GUACAMOLE?" HE GOES, "I WOULD NEVER HAVE PEAS IN MY HUACAMOLE." [ LAUGHTER ] IN YOUR WHAT? HE GOES, "I WOULD NEVER PUT ANY OF THAT TYPE OF STUFF IN MY HUACAMOLE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HE SAID IT LIKE SCARFACE?
Jimmy: USE A LITTLE GUACAMOLE. ALL OF A SUDDEN HE'S SCARFACE. LIKE, "HUACAMOLE. SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE HUACAMOLE. [ LAUGHTER ] HUACAMOLE. [ LAUGHTER ] REMEMBER THAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: YOU GOT TARIQ.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW, MAN. BUT, YOU KNOW, JEB BUSH. HIS CAMPAIGN IS ALSO SELLING THESE T-SHIRTS, THESE T-SHIRTS PRAISING HIS FATHER. CHECK IT OUT. IT SAYS, "MY DAD IS THE GREATEST MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN, AND IF YOU DON'T THINK SO WE CAN STEP OUTSIDE." [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS REALLY NICE, ACTUALLY. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, JEB ALSO RELEASED A SHIRT TO WEAR WHEN HE'S AROUND HIS BROTHER. CHECK IT OUT. THAT'S JUST MEAN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] $75.
Steve: $75? YOU GET THE GUACAMOLE WITH IT?
Jimmy: IT SAYS "HUACAMOLE" ON THE BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, A CLOTHING COMPANY IS MAKING T-SHIRTS INSPIRED BY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE, BERNIE SANDERS, WITH MESSAGES LIKE "FEEL THE BERN." BERNIE SANDERS, YEAH. THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE THEM FOR LINCOLN CHAFEE, TOO, BUT NOBODY WANTS TO WEAR A SHIRT THAT SAYS, "FEEL THE CHAFEE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BIKER SHORTS.
Steve: BIKE SHORTS, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. I SAW THAT A REPORTER ASKED JOE BIDEN IF HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AND HE SAID, QUOTE, "ONLY IF YOU'RE MY RUNNING MATE." THE REPORTER WAS LIKE, "BUT I'M TOTALLY UNQUALIFIED." AND BIDEN WAS LIKE, "WELL, LOOK WHO CAME UP WITH OUR CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. WELCOME ABOARD." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DO YOU SEE THIS? IN A RECENT EDUCATION SEMINAR, PRESIDENT OBAMA ADMITTED THAT HE CAN'T RAP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHEN THEY HEARD, AMERICANS WERE LIKE, "GOOD. IT'S LITERALLY THE ONE THING WE DON'T CARE IF THE PRESIDENT CAN DO. CAN YOU NEGOTIATE A DEAL? THAT'S STUFF WE CARE ABOUT, YEAH." OBAMA SAID HE CAN'T RAP, SAYING, QUOTE, "THAT'S ONE THING I CAN'T DO. I LIKE RAP, BUT I CANNOT RAP." IT APPEARS HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH BECAUSE WE GOT OUR HANDS ON AN OLD CASSETTE TAPE OF OBAMA RAPPING. I DON'T KNOW. YOU BE THE JUDGE. ♪♪

THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME, I'M A A MARRIED PERSON. THAT'S THE FIRST THING. COMING UP ON MY FOURTH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY, ACTUALLY. COMING UP, THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] I GOT MARRIED IN MY 20s, THOUGH, OKAY. SO THERE IS A LOT I DIDN'T KNOW. A LOT OF STUFF. LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, DID YOU KNOW AS A GUY, WHEN YOU BUY AN ENGAGEMENT RING FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND, IT'S SUPPOSED TO COST YOU THE EQUIVALENT OF THREE MONTHS SALARY? YOU KNOW THAT? SUPPOSED TO COST YOU THREE MONTHS OF WHAT YOU MAKE AT WORK TO BUY ONE RING, SO I QUIT MY JOB. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] PROBLEM SOLVED. WE'RE FOUR YEARS IN AND WE DECIDED WE WANT TO HAVE KIDS. THAT'S RIGHT, WE'RE TRYING FOR CHILDREN. BECAUSE I FINALLY REACHED THE POINT WHERE I REALIZED THE ONLY WAY I'M EVER GOING TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS IS TO LITERALLY MAKE NEW FRIENDS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] CLEARLY MY ONLY HOPE. YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO. PEOPLE GIVE YOU A LOT OF ADVICE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE KIDS, I FEEL LIKE. YOU KNOW THE ONE THING I KEEP HEARING FROM PEOPLE IS, "HEY YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD PRACTICE FOR HAVING A KID? GETTING A PET." THAT'S RIGHT, HAVING A PET IS GOOD PRACTICE FOR HAVING A A CHILD. YEAH, THAT'S TOTALLY THE SAME THING, RIGHT? YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BAIL THAT RABBIT OUT OF JAIL WHEN IT'S 16 YEARS- OLD. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEND THAT HAMSTER TO COLLEGE THREE TIMES UNTIL IT FINDS ITSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, YEAH. HE THOUGHT WANTED TO RUN ON THE WHEEL AND THEN HE SWITCHED AND THEN HE SWITCHED TO PHILOSOPHY AND NOW AT HE'S BACK HOME WORKING AT BEST BUY. HAMSTERS, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? [ LAUGHTER ] MIXED BAG! [ APPLAUSE ] HERE'S HOW BAD IT IS. I WENT TO SOMEONE'S APARTMENT RECENTLY, RIGHT? AND THEY HAD A CAT THERE THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AND I SAY, "IS THAT A NEW CAT?" AND THEY GO, "YEAH, HE'S ADOPTED." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TO WHICH I SAID, "OH, YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT CAT YOURSELF?" GUESS WHAT, IDIOT, THEY'RE ALL ADOPTED. ALL RIGHT? ALL THE CATS ARE ADOPTED. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW IT ALWAYS WORKS WITH CATS AND PEOPLE. I WANTED TO BE A REAL JERK AND BE LIKE, "OH WAS IT AN OPEN OR CLOSED ADOPTION?" [ LAUGHTER ] IS THE MOM CAT STILL IN THE PICTURE? SHE COME BY ON THE WEEKENDS AND VISIT HIM ON THE HOLIDAYS? IS SHE DEFENSIVE ABOUT IT? IS SHE LIKE, "LOOK, I HAD A LOT GOING ON BACK THEN, ALL RIGHT? "I WAS MESSED UP ON NIP, I WAS HOPPED UP ON DOORBELLS, I WAS IN NO CONDITION TO BE A A MOTHER!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "BUT NOW I'M THREE YEARS SOBER. I'M TAKING SOME CLASSES FROM DEVRY, I GOT EIGHT MORE LIVES, I'M GOING TO MAKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM COUNT!" [ APPLAUSE ] "I HAVEN'T CHASED A LASER IN TWO WEEKS!" [ LAUGHTER ] SEE, ANYONE CAN GET A PET. ANYONE CAN GO OUT AND GET A A PET. WE CAN DO THAT. IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO HAVE A A KID, THOUGH. IN FACT, MY WIFE SAID IF WE DON'T GET PREGNANT EARLY ENOUGH, SHE WANTS TO TRY FERTILITY TREATMENT. AND THAT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME, ALL RIGHT. IF YOU DO FERTILITY TREATMENTS, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET PREGNANT BUT YOU MIGHT GET TOO PREGNANT. YOU KNOW? YOU MIGHT. THERE'S A FAMILY IN NEW JERSEY, THE HAYES FAMILY, THEY DID IT THREE TIMES FOR SOME REASON. FIRST TIME, TWINS. SECOND TIME, TWINS. THIRD TIME, SIX KIDS. WHO'S YOUR FERTILITY CLINIC, COSTCO? THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] YOU DON'T NEED THAT MANY KIDS. PLEASE, JUST TAKE ONE OR TWO KIDS AND GRAB A CHEESE SAMPLE. IT WILL BE MUCH EASIER. [ LAUGHTER ] I ALREADY KNOW THE DIFFICULT AREA IT'S GOING TO BE MY WIFE AND I WHEN WE HAVE KIDS -- RELIGION. THAT'S GOING TO VERY TRICKY, RIGHT. BECAUSE WE'RE AN INTERFAITH COUPLE. THAT'S RIGHT, I'M IRISH CATHOLIC. MY WIFE IS JEWISH. SO THE ONLY THING WE BOTH CELEBRATED WAS THAT FREE U2 ALBUM. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS A BIG DEAL FOR US. THAT WAS A BIG ONE. [ APPLAUSE ] OH EVERY SEPTEMBER, ST. BONO DAY. OH, THANK YOU. OH, LOVE IT! MY WIFE SAYS SHE'S ALREADY GOT A PROBLEM WITH IT. SHE'S AFRAID THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET COMPETITIVE WITH OUR HOLIDAYS WHEN WE HAVE A FAMILY, YOU KNOW. SHE'S AFRAID THAT CHRISTMAS IS GOING TO WIPE OUT HANUKKAH. I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN, ALL RIGHT. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN EQUALLY TAKEN BY THE STORY OF HANUKKAH. WE KNOW THE STORY OF CHRISTMAS. A BABY WAS BORN TO A GIRL WHO HAD NEVER HAD SEX BEFORE. I MEAN, BIG DEAL. THAT HAPPENED EVERY WEEK IN MY HIGH SCHOOL. THAT'S NOTHING NEW. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S AN OLD -- I DON'T KNOW. IT'S SCIENCE, I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW. THINK ABOUT HANUKKAH. THINK ABOUT HANUKKAH FOR A A SECOND, RIGHT. THERE'S OIL THAT'S SUPPOSED TO LAST PEOPLE ONE DAY, LASTS EIGHT DAYS AND EIGHT NIGHTS. EIGHT DAYS AND EIGHT NIGHTS. THAT'S LONGEVITY, YOU KNOW. AND I FEEL LIKE IT WINS IF YOU COMPARE WITH MODERN DAY CIRCUMSTANCES. LIKE I HAVE FRIENDS ALL THE TIME THAT WILL BE LIKE, "HEY, MAN I HAD A BABY." I'LL BE LIKE, "OH, HEY, GOOD FOR YOU." BUT IF ONE OF MY FRIENDS IS LIKE, "HEY, MY iPHONE BATTERY LASTED A FULL 24 HOURS." I'M LIKE, "THAT'S AMAZING!" [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: JON RINEMAN, EVERYBODY. JON RINEMAN! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: YOU CAN GIVE A QUICK SHOUT-OUT TO -- YOUR MOM'S HERE, TONIGHT, ISN'T SHE?
YEAH, BOTH MY PARENTS.
Jimmy: OH YEAH?
JOHN AND NANCY RINEMAN.
Jimmy: HEY, JOHN AND NANCY RINEMAN. BE PROUD OF THIS GUY. HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ THERE THEY ARE, THERE. HEY, GUYS! YOU GOT TO BE PROUD OF THIS GUY. MY THANKS TO STEVE BUSCEMI, TAYLOR KITSCH, JONE RINEMAN AND THE ROOTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. STAY TUNED FOR "LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS." THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.
