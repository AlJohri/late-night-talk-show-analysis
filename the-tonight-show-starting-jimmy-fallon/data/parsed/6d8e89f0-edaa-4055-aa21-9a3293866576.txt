AND GET THIS THEY JUST ANNOUNCED THAT DURING THE SECOND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE THE MODERATORS WILL BE PICKING QUESTIONS BASED OFF OF WHAT'S TRENDING ON FACEBOOK. WHICH WILL EXPLAIN THEIR OPENING QUESTION, "IS BLACK CHYNA TOO GOOD FOR ROB?" WHY DO WE -- AND THIS IS VERY INTERESTING HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN IS ACTUALLY PREPARING TO FACE TWO DIFFERENT DONALD TRUMP'S IN THE DEBATES BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH VERSION IS GOING TO SHOW UP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK THIS WILL HELP YOU TELL WHO IS WHO. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SAY, "HEY WHAT A MINUTE TRUMP IS SORT OF RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO START LOOKING AT THIS." HE'S A 100 PERCENT WRONG. OKAY, HE'S A 100 PERCENT WRONG. I WILL DO A MUCH BETTER JOB. I'LL DO A GREAT JOB. I'LL BRING THE COUNTRY BACK. I'LL BRING OUR JOBS BACK. THE DONALD YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MEXICO. NO, I DON'T. I REALLY DON'T.

YEAH, MOTHERS WILL GET SIX WEEKS OFF AS LONG AS THEIR BABIES CAN PRODUCE THEIR LONG FORM BIRTH CERTIFICATES. YOU CAN GET THAT BACK. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THIS. SAMSUNG IS RECALLING ONE MILLION OF ITS GALAXY NOTE 7 PHONES BECAUSE THE BATTERY CAN OVERHEAT AND EXPLODE. ITS FORCED THE COMPANY TO DO A A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING AND COME UP WITH SOME DIFFERENT SLOGANS. HERE ARE A FEW OPTIONS. "SAMSUNG THOSE AREN'T A LOT OF TEXTS. YOUR PHONE IS LITERALLY BLOWING UP."

Jimmy: THAT'S EXCITING. MEANWHILE, EDWARD SNOWDEN SAID THIS WEEK THAT THE PUBLIC WOULD BE WORSE OFF IF HE HADN'T REVEALED THAT THE NSA WAS TRACKING PEOPLE'S PHONE CONVERSATIONS. ALTHOUGH, THE PUBLIC TRIED TO REMEMBER THE LAST TIME THEY ACTUALLY HAD A PHONE CONVERSATION. 2003 MAYBE? HELLO? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE ABOUT THIS.

WELL, LET ME SEE WHAT ELSE YOU GOT IN HERE.
Jimmy: OH, I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS JUST --
THIS IS A PRETTY BEAT UP BAG.
Jimmy: BECAUSE HE CARRIES THAT AROUND WITH HIM?
THIS IS LIKE A HOMELESS PERSON'S BAG, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] OH, LOOK! YOU KNOW WHAT?
Jimmy: WHAT?
HE LEFT THESE FOR YOU, SOFTBALLS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, IS THAT -- NO, I DIDN'T -- NO, THOSE ARE MY GIFT TO HIM.
NO.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT WAS IT. THAT'S WHAT I GAVE HIM.
YEAH, YOU GAVE HIM.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. I'LL GIVE THEM TO YOU LATER IN THE INTERVIEW, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
I PLAYED SOFTBALL WHEN I WAS A LOT YOUNGER.
Jimmy: YOU DID?
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT POSITION WERE YOU?
WELL, I PITCHED, AND I PLAYED OUTFIELD.
Jimmy: DID YOU REALLY?
I WAS -- YES. I PLAYED SUMMER LEAGUE WHEN I WAS ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.
Jimmy: WERE YOU GOOD?
UM, YOU KNOW, BY MY STANDARDS. [ LAUGHTER ] I AM -- I AM -- YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: ME TOO.
NOT THE GREATEST ATHLETE, BUT I LOVED PLAYING SPORTS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP --
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
AND -- [ SCOFFS ] LOCAL BUSINESSES WOULD SPONSOR THE TEAMS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO, WE WERE SPONSORED BY ONE OF THE CANDY DISTRIBUTORS IN OUR TOWN, AND THEY WERE PUSHING A CERTAIN PRODUCT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO, WE WERE CALLED "THE GOOD & PLENTY'S." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I GUESS THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING.
IS THAT CANDY STILL AROUND? I'M NOT EVEN SURE.
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
GOOD, YEAH.
Jimmy: SURE, YOU CAN GET GOOD & PLENTY'S.
YEAH, WELL IT WAS GREAT.
Jimmy: BUT I THINK THEY'RE EW. ACTUALLY -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHEN YOU WERE -- IT'S LIKE LIQUORISH AND --
YEAH, AND THEY WERE BLACK, WHITE, AND PINK.
Jimmy: YES, OF COURSE, I REMEMBER THAT.
SO, OF COURSE, OUR UNIFORMS WERE BLACK, WHITE, AND PINK.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I THINK THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
OH, YEAH. YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, IT DISTRACTED A LITTLE BIT FROM THE GAME, BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.
Jimmy: WHEN YOU WERE A A LITTLE GIRL, WERE YOU -- DID YOU EVER -- DID YOU DREAM OF BEING PRESIDENT, OR WAS THAT --
NO.
Jimmy: YOU COULDN'T DREAM OF THAT?
NO. NO, I MEAN, IT WASN'T EVEN WITHIN THE REALM OF THE POSSIBLE FOR LITTLE GIRLS BACK THEN. AND, THAT'S WHAT'S SO EXCITING ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE WE HAVE SLOWLY, BUT STEADILY, KNOCKED DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS. AND, IT'S IMPORTANT -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND, LOOK, SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE BARRIERS BEING KNOCKED DOWN. YOUR FORMER GUEST, DONALD TRUMP, YOU KNOW, HAS REFUSED TO ACTUALLY ADMIT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS AN AMERICAN, BORN IN AMERICA, AND FOR FIVE YEARS, HE'S BEEN HAMMERING IN THIS SO-CALLED "BIRTHER MOVEMENT," WHICH I THINK IS SO SICKENING. AND THEN, HE WENT AFTER A A DISTINGUISHED FEDERAL JUDGE BECAUSE HE WAS BORN INDIANA OF MEXICAN HERITAGE, CALLED HIM A A MEXICAN. HE WENT AFTER THE GOLD STAR FAMILY, WHOSE SON WAS HEROICALLY LOST IN IRAQ BECAUSE THEY'RE MUSLIMS. AND, I MEAN, YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND SAY TO YOURSELF, "WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY DO WE REALLY WANT? AND I WANT A COUNTRY WHERE BARRIERS ARE KNOCKED DOWN, AND LITTLE GIRLS AND LITTLE BOYS CAN FEEL LIKE THEY CAN GO AS FAR AS THEIR HARD WORK WILL TAKE THEM WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE AND ETHNICITY AND RELIGION AND GENDER AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND ALL OF THAT." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I HAVE TWO LITTLE GIRLS.
I KNOW YOU DO.
Jimmy: AND, I KNOW THEY'RE GONNA BE SO PSYCHED THAT I INTERVIEWED YOU. ONE DAY, THEY'RE GONNA BE ASKING ABOUT YOU, SO THIS IS A A HISTORIC NIGHT FOR ME. IT'S PRETTY COOL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WELL, YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU'VE GOT TWO LITTLE GIRLS, AND, YOU KNOW I LOVE KIDS. I STARTED MY --
Jimmy: YEAH.
PROFESSIONAL LIFE WORKING THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, AND SO FOR ME, FIGURING OUT HOW, NOT JUST YOUR KIDS OR MY GRANDKIDS, BUT ALL KIDS, GET EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO GO AS FAR AS THEIR HARD WORK AND TALENT WILL TAKE THEM. IT'S REALLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON IN OUR COUNTRY.
Jimmy: YEAH. WELL, WE HAVE A LITTLE --
AND THAT'S WHAT INTEND TO WORK ON.
Jimmy: WE HAVE LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS WATCHING OUR SHOW. THEY WATCH US, AND THEN, THEY WANT TO SEE YOU. WHY SHOULD THEY GROW UP TO BE PRESIDENT? WHY SHOULD THEY WANT TO BE PRESIDENT?
WELL, THEY SHOULD WANT TO BE WHAT THEY WANT TO BE. THEY SHOULD FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS. BUT THEY SHOULD NOT FEEL THAT THEY BUMP UP AGAINST A HARD GLASS CEILING, OR THAT BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE, WHERE THEY WERE BORN, WHO THEIR PARENTS ARE, ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE, THAT SOMEHOW THE AMERICAN DREAM ISN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR THEM. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO DECIDE IN THIS ELECTION WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT. YOU KNOW, ARE WE GOING TO BE A A COUNTRY THAT COMES TOGETHER, THAT RESPECTS EACH OTHER, THAT CELEBRATES OUR DIVERSITY, WHICH, I THINK, IS ONE OF OUR GREAT STRENGTHS --
Jimmy: YEAH.
OR ARE WE GONNA BE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER AND BE DIVIDED AND HAVE ALL THIS BIGOTRY AND BULLYING THAT'S GOING ON? OR WE GOING TO GET THE ECONOMY WORKING FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST PEOPLE AT THE TOP? AND, ARE WE GONNA KEEP THE WORLD SAFE AND WORK WITH PEOPLE WHOSE VALUES WE SHARE? I THINK THESE ARE CONSEQUENTIAL QUESTIONS, BUT THEY'RE ALSO REALLY AT THE ROOT OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY AND WHAT VALUES WE HAVE.
Jimmy: SPEAKING OF PITTING AGAINST EACH OTHER, THE DEBATE IS COMING.
YES, YES. IT IS.
Jimmy: SEPTEMBER 26TH --
RIGHT.
Jimmy: WE HAVE LESTER HOLT MODERATING. HOW -- WHICH TRUMP ARE YOU GONNA GET? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT -- BECAUSE HE SEEMS TO BE CHANGING A BIT.
WELL, LOOK. HE'S TRYING TO SOMEHOW CONVINCE PEOPLE TO FORGET EVERYTHING HE HAS SAID AND DONE, YOU KNOW. AND, I DON'T THINK THAT HE'S GONNA GET AWAY WITH THAT, AT LEAST, YOU KNOW, JUDGE US ON WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE'VE DONE, WHAT WE'VE STOOD FOR. AND, MAYA ANGELOU HAS THIS GREAT LINE, YOU KNOW. I ADMIRED HER SO MUCH, I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET TO KNOW HER. SHE SAID, "WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS YOU WHO HE IS, BELIEVE HIM THE FIRST TIME." RIGHT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT IS GOOD.
YEAH.
Jimmy: SHE IS AMAZING.
YEAH.

WELL, FROM YOUR LIPS TO GOD'S EARS RIGHT?
Jimmy: I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THIS. UH, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT CAMPAIGNING BECAUSE, WHEN YOU CAMPAIGN I FELL LIKE IT'S SO TRICKY. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO AND YOU HAVE TO SAY HI TO EVERYBODY AND BE HAPPY, UH, AND YOU DO. BUT ALSO PEOPLE KIND OF WANT TO SEE THIS HILLARY. WHICH IS THE BAD-ASS HILLARY. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, AND THE SERIOUS HILLARY. AND SO YOU HAVE TO LAUGH, BUT YOU ALSO, PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THIS. THEY WANT TO SEE SOMEONE WHOSE GONNA PROTECT US AND BE STRONG AND TOUGH, BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE REPUTATION.

Jimmy: AND YOU ABSOLUTELY, OH TRUST ME, YEAH, I DON'T MESS WITH YOU. YEAH, YEAH.
WE'LL PROTECT OUR COUNTRY AND KEEP IT SAFE AND DO SOME GOOD THINGS. SET SOME BIG GOALS.
Jimmy: I MEAN, YEAH, BUT IS IT A TRICKY BALANCE TO DO, WHERE YOU?
IT'S ESPECIALLY TRICKY FOR WOMEN. IT JUST IS, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THERE IS A LOT OF SERIOUS THINGS. THE OTHER NIGHT I WAS ON A SHOW AND BEING ASKED ABOUT ISIS AND IRAN, AND I WAS SERIOUS. THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO TALK ABOUT. AND THE REPUBLICAN'S WERE SAYING, "OH, SHE LOOKS SO SERIOUS." WELL, YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT ISIS WITH A BIG GRIN ON YOUR FACE. THEY'RE A BARBARIC EVIL GROUP THAT WE HAVE TO DEFEAT AND WIPE OUT. BUT IT IS A CONSTANT BALANCING ACT, YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU KIND OF KEEP THE ENERGY AND THE POSITIVE SPIRIT WHILE TAKING SERIOUSLY WHAT YOU NEED TO.
Jimmy: CAUSE THIS CAMPAIGN, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
I DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
Jimmy: I MEAN, IT'S LONG, AND LONG, AND LONG.
IT'S SO LONG.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE EVERYWHERE, I JUST DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODIES HERE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT OTHER DEMOCRACIES --
Jimmy: YEAH, WE DO USUALLY.
DO NOT TAKE FOREVER TO CHOOSE THEIR LEADERS. THEY'RE MUCH MORE FOCUSED AND THE TIME PERIOD IS COMPRESSED AND I JUST THINK IT DRAGS IT OUT FOR PEOPLE. AND IT'S HARD TO MAINTAIN THE ATTENTION OF THE PUBLIC WHEN YOU'VE BEEN GOING OUT FOR 18 MONTHS OR TWO YEARS, WHATEVER IT TAKES.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT REALLY IS. UM, WE DO A, I KNOW YOU HAVE A A TUMBLR, CALLED "LETTERS TO HILLARY."
YES.
Jimmy: WHERE KIDS WRITE YOU LETTERS.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: SOME ARE ADMIRING, SOME FUNNY, SOME EVEN A LITTLE BIT CRITICAL.
