Questlove: 524!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! THANK YOU! HI! THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME. LOOKING GOOD. LOOKING HOT. HOT CROWD TONIGHT RIGHT HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NEW YORK CITY HOT CROWD. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW" EVERYBODY. THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU. GOING TO BE A FUN ONE TONIGHT. FIRST, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. TODAY, DONALD TRUMP MADE A A SURPRISE TRIP TO MEXICO FOR A A MEETING WITH THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT ENRIQUE PEÑA NIETO. OR AS TRUMP PUT IT, "NICE TO MEET YOU, ERIC PIÑATA." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ERIC PIÑATA? OF COURSE, TRUMP'S MEETING TODAY IS HIS BIG CHANCE TO CONVINCE MEXICO THAT THEY SHOULD PAY FOR HIS PROPOSED BORDER WALL. I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE A TOUGH TIME. I MEAN, CHECK OUT WHAT PRESIDENT PEÑA NIETO HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE WALL.
THERE IS NO WAY THAT MEXICO CAN PAY A WALL LIKE THAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DOESN'T SOUND TOO PROMISING. BUT MAYBE TRUMP SHOULD HAVE MET WITH MEXICO'S EX-PRESIDENT, FELIPE CALDERóN.
MEXICAN PEOPLE, WE ARE NOT GOING TO PAY ANY SINGLE CENT FOR THAT STUPID WALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. MAYBE TRUMP SHOULD JUST STICK WITH THE EX-EX-PRESIDENT, VICENTE FOX.
I DECLARE, I'M NOT GOING TO PAY FOR THAT [ BLEEP ] WALL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, ALL RIGHT NOW. EVERYBODY CALM DOWN. WHEN HILLARY SAW THAT TRUMP WAS IN MEXICO, SHE SAID, "I'LL PAY FOR THE WALL." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: QUICK. LET'S DO IT QUICK. I SAW THAT A REPORTER WENT THROUGH HILLARY CLINTON'S SCHEDULE WHILE SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE AND FOUND THAT SHE AND BILL WERE OFTEN AWAY FROM EACH OTHER, SOMETIMES EVEN ON DIFFERENT CONTINENTS. WHEN ASKED WHY THEY DIDN'T TRY TO COORDINATE THEIR SCHEDULES, HILLARY SAID, "OH, WE DID." [ LAUGHTER ] SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS. CHRIS CHRISTIE JUST VETOED A A PROPOSAL TO BOOST NEW JERSEY'S MINIMUM WAGE TO $15 AN HOUR. THEN FAST FOOD WORKERS SAID, "AFTER ALL WE'VE DONE FOR YOU?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DID YOU SEE THIS? AFTER HIS DISAPPOINTING PRESIDENTIAL RUN, FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY WILL COMPETE ON THE UPCOMING SEASON OF "DANCING WITH THE STARS." [ CHEERS ] WHICH IS WHY THIS SEASON WILL BE CALLED "DANCING WITH THE STARS AND RICK PERRY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: SO, IT'S AN APPETIZER.
Jimmy: YEAH. OF COURSE, ANOTHER REALITY SHOW THAT WE LOVE HERE IS "BACHELOR IN PARADISE." AND THIS WEEK WAS ANOTHER GREAT EPISODE FULL OF CRAZY DRAMA. BUT IF YOU MISSED IT, DON'T WORRY. BECAUSE HERE TO REENACT A SCENE WITH ACTUAL LINES FROM THE SHOW, IT'S QUESTLOVE FROM THE ROOTS AND DAVID SPADE. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: GUYS, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.
Questlove: THAT'S, JIMMY. TONIGHT, I'LL BE PLAYING GRANT, A FIREFIGHTER WHO DOESN'T WANT TO FIGHT.
AND I'LL BE PLAYING LACE, 25-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO FEELS TOTALLY UNSURE RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHENEVER -- WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. ♪♪
Questlove: HONESTLY, LACE ACTING THE WAY SHE IS RIGHT NOW IS PISSING ME OFF.

Questlove: CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A LITTLE BIT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

TWO WEEKS OF TENNIS BALLS GOING BACK AND FORTH, OR AS MY DOG PUT IT, "IF YOU NEED ME, I'M OUT WITH MY FRIENDS." [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD TICKETS. AND FINALLY, HERE'S A LOCAL STORY. A WATER MAIN BREAK HERE IN NEW YORK CITY RECENTLY CAUSED THE MUSICAL "CATS" TO CANCEL A A PERFORMANCE. OR AS EVERY GUY IN LINE PUT IT, "OH, NO." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW! GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

SO, I MEAN, IT'S A DISASTER. AND I'M IN THERE, AND THIS GUY'S GOING 50 TIMES. HE'S GOT A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS GOING ON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO HE'S DOING THAT, AND THEN HE'S LIKE SQUISHY FEET COMING OUT. YOU KNOW? BY THE WAY, WHEN I GO IN MY SHOES, I THROW THEM AWAY WHEN I GET HOME. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW DIRTY THE AIRPLANE BATHROOM, YEAH OF COURSE.
IT'S FILTHY. SO THAT GUY, BUT YOU CAN GET IN TROUBLE. I TOOK HIS HEAD OFF IN THE PICTURE.
Jimmy: YOU DID YES. YOU DIDN'T GET HIS FACE.
I GOT YELLED AT ONCE. I GOT SUED-YELLED AT. UM, I GOT SUED --

YES, BECAUSE ON STUPID INSTAGRAM, I TOOK A, I WAS AT A A CONCERT AND THERE WAS LIKE A A 90-YEAR-OLD WOMAN NEAR ME. AND EVERYONE STOOD UP, AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHY SHE WAS THERE, BUT SHE WAS SITTING DOWN SO OF COURSE, I TOOK A PICTURE BECAUSE I'M GROSS AND THIRSTY. I SAID, HEY, THIS GIRL'S OBVIOUSLY SHROOMING OUT, SHE'S FREAKING OUT.
Jimmy: A 90-YEAR-OLD LADY?
SHE HAD A LAWYER CALL ME. YEAH. MY CLIENT, SHE'S LIKE, I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN. I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK I'M SCHROOMING OUT. I'M LIKE, NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE SCHROOMING. YOU'RE ON MOLLY, OBVIOUSLY. [ LAUGHTER ]

YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: UM, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT "FAMELESS."
"FAMELESS?" YEAH, RIGHT.
Jimmy: IT'S A PRANK REALITY SHOW, KIND OF.
RIGHT, IT'S SORT OF CONFUSING. IT'S ALL THESE PEOPLE GO ON THESE REALITY SHOWS. THEY AUDITION FOR THEM, AND THEN WHEN THEY MAKE IT THEY HAVE TO DO A PSYCHE EVALUATION, THEY HAVE TO DO ALL THESE CRAZY THINGS. AND WHEN THEY'RE READY TO BE ON, WE PICK LIKE THE MOST PUMPED-UP WANT TO BE FAMOUS ONES, THE CRAZIEST ONES, AND THEN WE JUST MAKE UP A FAKE SHOW. 'CAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN CARE WHAT THEY WERE ON. THEY JUST WANT TO BE FAMOUS. SO WE PUT THEM ON LIKE, "BLIND BLIND DATE." YOU KNOW, WE LIKE MAKE UP THAT SOUNDS LIKE A REAL SHOW. OR "WHAT'S IN MY MOUTH," LIKE A A COOKING SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN WE MAKE IT AND IT'S A A TOTAL DISASTER.
Jimmy: "WHAT'S IN MY MOUTH." YEAH, AND THEY GO, I'LL PLAY THAT.
YEAH, WE KEEP TRYIN' TO THINK OF -- AND THEN WE HAVE LIKE A CELEBRITY ON NOW AND THEN TO MAKE IT SEEM REAL. I'M ON IT SOMETIMES. IT'S PRETTY FUNNY, BUT IT IS -- IT IS HARD. I'M NOT A GOOD PRANKER.

Jimmy: BUT DID YOU GET -- NOW YOU'RE THE ROAST MASTER AT "THE COMEDY CENTRAL ROAST OF ROB LOWE." AND I WOULD ASSUME 'CAUSE YOU TAPED IT ALREADY, BUT I WOULD ASSUME THE ROAST MASTER GETS SPECIAL TREATMENT.
THAT'S WHAT I ASSUMED. I DID NOT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FIRST OF ALL, I COULD NEVER GET ROASTED. I COULD NEVER HANDLE IT.
Jimmy: YOU COULDN'T, NO.
NO, AND THEN --
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT A GOOD SPORT ABOUT THAT STUFF? OR JUST --
YEAH. I'M A BAD SPORT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHATEVER THE TERM IS. BECAUSE LAST YEAR WAS KEVIN HART WAS THE ROAST MASTER. I GO, OH, THIS IS A FUN JOB. SETH ROGEN'S DONE IT. I GO, I'M SORT OF OFF LIMITS. I WAS TRYING TO GET THAT WORD AROUND. IT DID NOT WORK.
Jimmy: TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO TALKING BACKSTAGE --
MACHINE GUN. YEAH, THEY GO AFTER EVERYBODY OUT THERE. AND I REMEMBER PETE DAVIDSON, I BROUGHT HIM OUT. AND WHILE I'M WALKING AWAY, HE GOES, AH, MACAULAY CULKIN LOOKS LIKE -- NOW.

AND THEN THEY COME UP TO ME IN A COMMERCIAL, 'CAUSE I'M DOING A LOT OF THIS. BECAUSE THEY KEEP HITTING ME. AND THEY GO, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE, UH, NOT HAPPY. I GO, I'M NOT HAPPY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M UNHAPPY, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE. I GO, I DON'T LIKE JOKES ABOUT ME. THEY GO, YOU'VE GOT TO KIND OF PLAY ALONG. AND I GO, BUT IT'S HORRIBLE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT SOME OF THE JOKES ARE FUNNY, LIKE PEYTON MANNING GOES, DAVID SPADE IS SHORT AND DUMB. [ LAUGHTER ] SORT OF ACCURATE.
Jimmy: IT'S PEYTON MANNING, TOO.
AND IT'S FUN TO HAVE PEYTON MANNING THERE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND ANN COULTER CAME. SHE GOT IN THE CROSS FIRE A A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: AND HOW WAS ROB LOWE? 'CAUSE ROB LOWE IS A FUNNY GUY, AND WE KNOW HIM.
YEAH, LOVE HIM.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW HIM FROM "TOMMY BOY."
HE WAS A GOOD SPORT. YEAH, HE WAS IN "TOMMY BOY" WITH ME.
Jimmy: BUT THEY HIT ROB LOWE AS WELL.
YEAH, THEY REMEMBER, YOU REMEMBER IN THAT SONG. THEY HIT ROB LOWE. YEAH, BUT EVERY JOKE IS ABOUT HOW GOOD LOOKING HE IS AND HOW MANY GIRLS HE SLEPT WITH. I'M LIKE FOLKS, THESE ARE COMPLIMENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE TRYING TO GET -- TO EVERYONE I GO, GUYS, WE NEED NEW JOKES. HE'S TOO GOOD. THAT'S WHY THEY START HEADING TO ME, BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE BIGGER TARGET. BUT, HE WOUND UP BEING REALLY COOL ABOUT IT, AND WE HAD A A BLAST.
Jimmy: IT'S ON LABOR DAY AND IT'S THE COMEDY CENTRAL ROAST. DID YOU GET A CHANCE FOR YOU PERSONALLY TO HIT HIM WITH A A COUPLE JOKES?
A FEW. WELL I THINK, WHEN I WALK OUT, I GO, WE'RE HERE TO ROAST ONE OF THE BIGGEST STARS OF 1987. [ LAUGHTER ] I GO, ROB'S NOT A GAY MAN, BUT HE PLAYS ONE EVERY MOMENT OF HIS LIFE. HE HAS A SKIN CARE LINE OUT, YOU CAN BUY IT ONLINE. YOU WON'T, BUT YOU CAN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE HAD A SEX TAPE --
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
WAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN IT COULD HURT YOUR CAREER. BUT HE HURT HIS CAREER THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, WITH HIS ACTING. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, THE REST OF IT'S TOO R-RATED.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. WHAT WAS THE ONE YOU DID, UH, MEANINGFUL ROLES?
OH, YEAH. HE SAID -- ROB SAID, IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO GET MEANINGFUL ROLES WHEN YOU'RE THIS GOOD LOOKING. I TRIED TO ASK BRAD PITT ABOUT THAT, BUT HE WAS TOO BUSY ACTING IN MEANINGFUL ROLES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DUDE, WE LOVE YOU. EVERY TIME YOU COME ON, COME BACK. WE LOVE YOU.
