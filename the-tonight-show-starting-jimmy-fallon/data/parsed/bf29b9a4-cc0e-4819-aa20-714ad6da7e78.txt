Jimmy: OH, LOOKING GOOD! LOOKING GOOD OUT THERE. HOT CROWD! HOT CROWD TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. WELCOME, EVERYBODY, TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. YOU ARE THE SHOW. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. WELL, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. IT'S KIND OF SAD NEWS, BIG NEWS THAT ANGELINA JOLIE AND BRAD PITT ARE SEPARATING. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] YEAH, IT'S PRETTY SCARY WHEN EVEN ANGELINA JOLIE AND BRAD PITT ARE LIKE, "EH, I COULD DO BETTER." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GO -- NO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I SAW THAT BILL CLINTON HAD A A BIG BIRTHDAY PARTY ON FRIDAY NIGHT. BUT GET THIS, APPARENTLY HILLARY DID NOT ATTEND. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] OR AS BILL PUT IT, "AW, SHE ALWAYS GIVES ME THE PERFECT GIFT." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EVERY YEAR. AND THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY -- IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH ACTUALLY PLANS TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] EVEN MORE SURPRISING, HE MADE THAT DECISION BEFORE JEB DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: DAD, WHAT IS -- DAD. AND THIS WEEK, NEW YORK CITY IS HOSTING OVER 190 FOREIGN COUNTRIES OVER AT THE UNITED NATIONS. OR AS DONALD TRUMP PUT IT, "THIS IS GOING TO BE LIKE INSULTING FISH IN A BARREL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS SAD. LOSER. SAD. SWITZERLAND, YOUR CHEESE HAS HOLES IN IT. IT'S LAME." [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS SKIPPING THIS WEEK'S MEETING AT THE U.N. AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT, TRUMP STARTED CLEANING UP THE ROSE PETALS HE'D SPRINKLED INTO THE JACUZZI. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "NOT GONNA HAPPEN. ANOTHER NIGHT. PUT THE CAP ON THE CHAMPAGNE. LOWER THE MUSIC. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT." ♪♪
Steve: PUTIN.
Jimmy: SPEAKING OF TRUMP, I READ THAT IVANKA TRUMP IS NOW THE FIRST OF DONALD TRUMP'S CHILDREN TO RECEIVE SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION. THEY WERE TRYING TO COME UP WITH A CODE NAME, BUT TRUMP WAS LIKE, "JUST USE MY CODE NAME FOR HER, FAVORITE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DON'T GET ME WRONG, I ALSO LOVE ME JR. AND THE OTHER ONES." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ME JR. NO, THAT WAS A GOOD -- I DON'T KNOW. DONALD TRUMP JR. ACTUALLY CAUSED A LITTLE CONTROVERSY LAST NIGHT WHEN HE SENT OUT A A TWEET THAT COMPARED THE SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS TO A BOWL OF SKITTLES. THIS IS REAL. HE SAID, "IF I HAD A BOWL OF SKITTLES AND I TOLD YOU JUST THREE WOULD KILL YOU, WOULD YOU TAKE A HANDFUL?" [ AUDIENCE OHS ] AT WHICH POINT, CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID, "LET 'EM IN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'LL EAT THEM ALL -- I MEAN, GREET THEM ALL." AND THIS MADE ME LAUGH. THIS IS FUNNY. THE OTHER DAY, DONALD TRUMP GAVE A SPEECH DURING A LUNCH EVENT AND, IF I'M BEING HONEST, THE GUY SITTING BEHIND TRUMP MADE IT HARD TO FOCUS ON WHAT TRUMP WAS SAYING. I DON'T THINK HE REALIZED HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO THE MICROPHONE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WE'RE LEADING AND WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF FUN. [ EATING NOISES ] [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF FUN ON THE CAMPAIGN AND ON THE TRAIL. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF FUN WHEN YOU COME UP AND THESE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE TELEPROMPTER WORKING, BUT THAT'S OKAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LUCKILY I BROUGHT SOME NOTES. BUT TODAY, I DO WANT TO -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HOW DO YOU NOT -- HE'S SITTING RIGHT BEHIND THE GUY SPEAKING. YOU'RE GOING TO EAT LUNCH? I'VE NEVER -- THAT WAS A SLOPPY WAY OF EATING RIGHT THERE. GUYS, LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE GARY JOHNSON APPEARED ON "60 MINUTES" THIS WEEKEND TO TRY TO MAKE HIS CASE FOR BEING PRESIDENT. OF COURSE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T TAKE GARY JOHNSON VERY SERIOUSLY, AND, WELL, JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.
I THINK THEY ARE DINOSAURS, AND I THINK WE'RE THE COMET IN THIS WHOLE EQUATION. 70% OF AMERICA DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHO WE ARE, AND YET WE EXIST. IF MICKEY MOUSE WERE THE THIRD NAME ON ANY POLL, MICKEY WOULD BE AT 30%, BECAUSE MICKEY'S A A KNOWN COMMODITY. BUT MICKEY'S NOT ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50 STATES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: EVEN RYAN LOCHTE WAS LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL IS THAT GUY TALKING ABOUT? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT IS HE SAYING?"

TAKE A LOOK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IN A STATEMENT, NEWTON SAID, "I'M JUST TRYING TO MIX THINGS UP AND ADD SOME CLASS TO THESE PRESS CONFERENCES. AND IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT, TAKE IT UP WITH MY FRIEND, MR. CHUCKLES." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK HE LOOKS NICE. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I AGREE. AND GET THIS, I READ THAT A A CANADIAN MAN SURVIVED A BEAR ATTACK BY DEFENDING HIMSELF WITH A WINE BOTTLE. ALTHOUGH IT MUST HAVE BEEN A A REALLY SNOBBY BEAR, BECAUSE ALL THE GUY DID WAS JUST SHOW THE BEAR THE LABEL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "YELLOWTAIL MERLOT? BLECH! I'D RATHER DRUNK POND WATER.

I MEAN, AFTER THREE YEARS, IT'S LIKE HE'S BRAINWASHED ME. I HAD NO CHOICE. IT'S LIKE -- I'M ALWAYS FIGHTING WITH HIM BECAUSE LIKE SOMETIMES I ARRIVE HOME WHEN THE SEASON STARTS LIKE NOW, LIKE A WEEK AGO, AND EVEN WHEN HE'S ALONE TO WATCH THE GAMES, HE'S IN HIS WHOLE OUTFITS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE I'M LIKE, NOBODY'S HERE. HE'S LIKE, JUST HIM IN FRONT OF THE TV.
Jimmy: BY HIMSELF, LIKE, ALL GEEKED OUT.
YEAH. HE OWNS, I THINK -- FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THAT HE THINKS, LIKE, ALL THOSE OUTFITS ARE, LIKE, WEARING, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, LIKE TOM FORD OR GUCCI OR SOMETHING. FOR HIM --.
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK THIS IS GUCCI. I DON'T THINK THIS IS -- [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M LIKE, JOE, THAT'S NOT LIKE A BRAND OF CLOTHING, THE STEELERS LOGO IS NOT.
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT HE TREATS IT LIKE THAT.
BUT HE YEAH, HE -- I MEAN, NOW I'VE LEARNED TO ACCEPT IT. BUT AT THE BEGINNING, IT WAS KIND OF WEIRD. HE FORCES ME A LOT OF THINGS. LIKE, I FIND ME IN THE MORNING, LIKE I HAVE TO GO TO SET AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING AND I HAVE MY NINJA COFFEE MACHINE, THAT I PREPARE MY COFFEE. MY COFFEE I WANT TO TAKE IT IN MY, LIKE, THERMAL, YOU KNOW -- THE THING THAT YOU TAKE YOUR COFFEE.
Jimmy: A MUG?
A MUG?
Jimmy: YEAH, A MUG, YEAH. YEAH.
BUT NOT A REGULAR MUG. THE ONE THAT KEEPS THE HOT.
Jimmy: OKAY. SURE. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
SO, LIKE, IF I PUT IT THERE, YOU KNOW, AND I TURN AROUND ONE SECOND AND I GRAB IT AND I GO, I REALIZE HE CHANGED IT INTO A A STEELERS ONE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO, LIKE THE WHOLE DAY I'M STUCK WITH THE STEELERS THING. I ALWAYS HAVE A PEN IN MY BAG, BECAUSE EVERYBODY NEEDS A PEN IF I NEED TO WRITE SOMETHING.
Jimmy: SURE.
I LOOK FOR MY PEN. HE CHANGE IT INTO THE STEELER PEN. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: HE SNEAKS IT IN YOUR LIFE.
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING THAT HE FORCES ME TO WEAR -- TO HAVE ALL THE TIME.
Jimmy: WHOA, WAIT. WHOA.
IT'S MY STEELER NAIL FILE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S DOING IT VERY SMART, THOUGH.
BUT EVERYWHERE, LIKE, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW I'M GOING TO FIND THESE THINGS IN MY HOUSE. OKAY.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO LIKE THE STEELERS.
OKAY, IT'S A STEELER FAN. DO YOU WANT IT? YOU'RE NOT A STEELER FAN?
Jimmy: NO, I AM NOW, YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, GIVE IT TO ME, THEN. HE'LL GET MAD. THEN HE'LL GET MAD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DO YOU KNOW THE PLAYERS AND EVERYTHING NOW? I MEAN, NOW THAT YOU KNOW --
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, REALLY, WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT I MEAN, I LOVE THE ENTHUSIASM.

THEY HAVE A LOT OF GOOD PLAYS THAT I LIKE.
Jimmy: THEY DO.
SO NOW I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. I LOVE HOW HE ENJOYS -- I MEAN, IT'S BETTER THAT HE'S ADDICTED TO THAT THAN TO SOMETHING ELSE. YOU KNOW? HE'S AT HOME WITH HIS WHOLE OUTFIT, NO GAMBLING SOMEWHERE IN VEGAS WITH STRIPPERS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN, RIGHT?
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. NOT AT ALL. I LIKE YOUR ACCENT AND I THINK IT WOULD MAKE THE GAME MORE FUN IF I WAS WATCHING IT WITH YOU.
WHAT GAME?
Jimmy: WELL, I HAVE THIS GAME IDEA AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YES TO IT. BUT I JUST THINK I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOU TALK ON HELIUM. I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE FUN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE YOUR VOICE. BUT HIGHER.
WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE MY VOICE, YOU MEAN, YOU LAUGH AT MY VOICE?
Jimmy: NO, NO. I LOVE I LOVE IT.
WHAT IS THIS? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, LET ME TAKE THAT OFF. THAT'S TO CLOSE TO KEEP THE HELIUM IN THERE. SO, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO. WE'VE NOT REHEARSED THIS, SO JUST, YOU INHALE.
IT'S LIKE LEGAL TO INHALE THIS THING?
Jimmy: YES. IT'S HELIUM. YES. JUST INHALE IT AND THEN MAYBE LOOK INTO THIS CAMERA OVER HERE, CAMERA THREE, AND SAY, "MY NAME IS SOFIA VERGARA."
