[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE SHOW TO WATCH. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I LOVE IT. THANK YOU, GUYS. GUYS, WE HAVE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE AND DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER HILLARY CLINTON ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. BACKSTAGE SHE TOLD ME SHE'S A A HUGE FAN OF THE SHOW AND I WAS LIKE, "I KNOW, I READ IT IN YOUR E-MAILS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SHE'S VERY NICE. OF COURSE, WE'RE GOING TO TALK WITH HER ABOUT THE ELECTION, AND THINGS SEEM TO BE CHANGING ALL THE TIME. IN FACT, A NEW NATIONAL POLL FOUND THAT JEB BUSH HAS ACTUALLY PASSED MARCO RUBIO FOR THIRD PLACE AMONG REPUBLICANS. WHICH MEANS RUBIO NOW HAS THE SAME FEELING AS WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING A MARATHON AND GET PASSED BY THE GUY DRESSED AS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AND YOU GO, "COME ON, EVEN THAT GUY, TOO? HE'S A NOVELTY RUNNER."
Steve: C'MON.
Jimmy: JEB HAS ACTUALLY BEEN MAKING FUN OF MARCO RUBIO FOR WEARING A PAIR OF BOOTS WITH HIGH HEELS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. I THINK THE HEELS HELP RUBIO A A LOT. I MEAN, JUST TAKE -- TAKE A A LOOK AT THE LATEST CAMPAIGN AD HE DID WITHOUT HIS BOOTS ON. LOOK.
OUR ALLIES DON'T TRUST US. [ LAUGHTER ] OUR ENEMIES DON'T FEAR US. THE WORLD DOESN'T KNOW WHERE AMERICA STANDS.
Jimmy: GIVE HIM A BREAK. HE'S GOT A NICE MESSAGE. LISTEN TO WHAT HE'S SAYING. COME ON. DOESN'T MATTER.
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: GET THIS, I READ THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY FOUR STARS IN THE UNIVERSE NAMED AFTER DONALD TRUMP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU BELIEVE THAT? A BURNING BALL OF HOT AIR HAS STARS NAMED AFTER HIM.
Steve: WOW. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT AMAZING? THIS IS PRETTY FUNNY, HERE. THERE'S SOME OLD FOOTAGE GOING AROUND I JUST SAW OF BERNIE SANDERS GIVING A SPEECH ON THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS IN 1991. AND IT REALLY SHOWS YOU HOW FAR HE'S COME. TAKE A LOOK AT BERNIE SANDERS.
CLEARLY, THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES WILL WIN THIS WAR, BUT THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION CAUSED WILL NOT, IN MY OPINION -- [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO ONE -- YOU KNOW EVEN THE CLEANING LADY OPENED THE DOOR AND WAS LIKE, "NOPE, WRONG DOOR. I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. I'LL COME BACK. [ APPLAUSE ] I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THERE." SEEMS LIKE A DRAG IN THERE, YEAH. SOME OTHER BIG NEWS TODAY. THE OSCAR NOMINATIONS CAME OUT THIS MORNING.

ACTUALLY, ONE OF THE ACTORS NOMINATED WAS LEONARDO DiCAPRIO FOR HIS MOVIE "THE REVENANT," WHICH TELLS THE TRUE STORY OF A A 19th CENTURY MAN IN SOUTH DAKOTA WILDERNESS WHO SURVIVED A BEAR ATTACK.

WHEN ASKED IF HE TESTED IT ON RATS, PUTIN SAID, "YOU COULD CALL THEM THAT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SURE, YEAH, YEAH. THEY'RE RATS." UH, GUYS, THIS IS PRETTY CUTE HERE. APPARENTLY THE WORLD'S OLDEST LIVING LAND ANIMAL, A A 183-YEAR-OLD TORTOISE NAMED JONATHAN WAS RECENTLY PUT ON A A NEW DIET OF FRUITS AND VEGGIES, AND IT'S ALREADY HELPED HIM BECOME MORE ACTIVE. YEAH. EVEN HAD ENOUGH ENERGY TO SPELL OUT HIS FIRST MESSAGE. LOOK AT THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] KILM? KILM?
Steve: KILM.
Jimmy: KILME.
Steve: KILME.
Jimmy: FINALLY, THIS IS JUST CRAZY. I SAW THAT A SELF-DRIVING CAR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GOT STUCK GOING IN CIRCLES WITHOUT ANYONE BEHIND THE WHEEL. POLICE HAD TO USE SPIKE STRIPS TO GET IT TO STOP, WHICH IS THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THAT COPS PUT A STOP TO MAKING DOUGHNUTS. IT'S VERY INTERSTING.

WE SET UP A CAMERA DOWNSTAIRS HERE AT 30 ROCK AND WE ASKED PARENTS IF THEY WANTED TO BRING IN THEIR KIDS TO GET A PICTURE TAKEN FOR A NEW NBC WEBSITE CALLED "NBC ONLINE PRESCHOOL PLAYROOM."

WELL, THIS ONE IS IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.
Jimmy: YEP.
AND WE ARE, YOU KNOW, REALLY EXCITED ABOUT BEING DOWN THERE, BRINGING A DEBATE THERE. SO, IT'S THE SAME KIND OF PREPPING, BUT THERE'S A LOT THAT'S HAPPENED SINCE OUR LAST DEBATE, AND OBVIOUSLY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID A LOT MORE THINGS. AND SO, YOU GOT TO GET SORT OF UP TO DATE AND PREPARED.

NO, GOVERNOR O'MALLEY IS THERE, TOO.
Jimmy: OH, HE IS THERE TOO?

YEAH, NO.
Jimmy: THAT JUST INTIMIDATED ME, THAT LOOK RIGHT THERE, YEAH.
I MEAN, IF I'M SO FORTUNATE TO BE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE, OBVIOUSLY, I'LL RUN AGAINST WHOEVER THEY NOMINATE, BUT IF IT'S DONALD TRUMP, IT WILL BE QUITE THE -- QUITE THE SHOWDOWN.
Jimmy: CAN I ASK, THIS IS A A PERSONAL QUESTION, BUT --
OH, NO, REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M REALLY GONNA, YEAH, GET IN DEEP HERE. NO, NOTHING. THAT'S ME, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M WONDERING ABOUT SLEEP. BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU DON'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP, SOMETIMES YOU JUST GET LOOPY AND DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAY, AND THEN EVERYONE PICKS UP YOU JUST SAID SOMETHING BAD --
THIS IS SERIOUS. YOU'RE SERIOUS BECAUSE, YEAH, I MEAN, LACK OF SLEEP, BEING FATIGUED, IS A BIG PROBLEM AND ANY KIND OF STRESSFUL SITUATION, WHETHER IT'S HOSTING "THE TONIGHT SHOW," RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT SECRETARY OF STATE, DID YOU LEARN TO, LIKE, SLEEP ON COMMAND?
I DID.
Jimmy: CAN YOU SLEEP ANYWHERE?
YEAH, BUT I WAS SO TIRED ALL THE TIME. I WAS PERPETUALLY IN A SLEEP DEFICIT, SO IT WAS KIND OF EASY FOR ME. I WOULD JUST GO, "OH MY GOSH, I'VE GOT TEN MINUTES. BANG." BECAUSE WHAT USED TO HAPPEN -- YOU KNOW, JET LAG IS REALLY SERIOUS WHEN YOU'RE FLYING THROUGH TIME ZONES AROUND THE WORLD.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO I WOULD HAVE TO GET OFF, AND I'D HAVE TO GO BE READY TO GO TO A PUBLIC EVENT, TO MEET WITH, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTER, LEADER OF THE COUNTRY. AND I'D BE STANDING UP THERE AND I'D BE DIGGING MY FINGERNAILS INTO MY PALMS TO KEEP MYSELF AWAKE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I COULD -- I'D BE STANDING ON THE STAGE, OR WHEREVER I WAS, EVERYBODY I TRAVELED WITH WOULD BE SITTING THERE LIKE, KNOCKED OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M LOOKING AT THEM. THEY'RE ALL ASLEEP. I'M HAVING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY. [ LAUGHTER ]

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THAT'S ONE TRICK IF YOU'RE TIRED.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT. BUT, YOU KNOW, SERIOUSLY, YOU NEED TO GET INTO A ROUTINE, WHICH IS HARD. YOU GOT TWO LITTLE BABIES. THAT'S HARD, AND YOU WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH THEM AND YOU HAVE SO MUCH ELSE YOU HAVE TO DO. BUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN --

ELMO.
Jimmy: DID YOU SEE HOW THEY MELTED WITH THAT?
OH, MY GOSH. YOU KNOW, FOR CHRISTMAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I GOT HER WAS THIS ELMO PEEK-A-BOO DOLL WHERE YOU TURN IT ON AND IT TALKS. AND IT TALKS IN LITTLE ELMO'S VOICE. AND THEN IT LIFTS UP THE LITTLE CLOTH AND HIDES ITSELF. "PEEK-A-BOO." SHE WAS SO CARRIED AWAY.
Jimmy: OH YEAH, NO, TOYS ARE THE NEXT GENERATION THING, YOU CAN TYPE IN THEIR NAMES, AND ELMO WILL SAY, "HI, WINNIE. HILLARY." IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING. TECHNOLOGY HAS TAKEN IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: I KNOW YOU'RE VERY INVOLVED WITH SOCIAL MEDIA, TECHNOLOGY, AND TWEETING. YOU TWEETED THE STATE OF THE UNION. WILL YOU TWEET THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE TONIGHT?
WELL, I WON'T BE WATCHING IT, SO.

Jimmy: YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM. THEY'RE THE BEST. WELCOME BACK TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH FORMER SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK, HILLARY CLINTON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU CAN SEE HER IN THE UPCOMING DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES' DEBATE MODERATED BY LESTER HOLT THIS SUNDAY AT 9:00 P.M. HERE ON NBC. THANKS AGAIN FOR DOING THIS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE DEBATE HERE BECAUSE IT'S A BIG DEAL. THEY JUST CAME OUT TODAY WITH THE -- THE NEW YORK TIMES, OR SOMEONE CAME OUT AND SAID NATIONAL NUMBERS -- THAT BERNIE AND YOU ARE KIND OF CLOSE.
OH, WE'RE IN A TIGHT RACE.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE, LIKE, A A GIANT -- YOU HAD A 20-POINT LEAD AT ONE POINT.
WELL, YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW, THAT'S REALLY ARTIFICIAL. ALL OF THOSE EARLY SOUNDINGS AND POLLS -- ONCE YOU GET INTO IT, THIS IS A DEMOCRATIC ELECTION FOR OUR NOMINEE. AND IT GETS REALLY CLOSE, EXCITING. AND IT REALLY DEPENDS UPON, YOU KNOW, WHO MAKES THE BEST CASE THAT YOU CAN BE THE NOMINEE TO BEAT WHOEVER THE REPUBLICANS PUT UP AND TRY TO GET YOUR FOLKS WHO SUPPORT YOU TO COME OUT. I FIND IT EXCITING. I MEAN, THIS IS NOT A JOB THEY GIVE AWAY. YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO WORK HARD FOR IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND IT IS THE HARDEST JOB IN THE WORLD. SO I GET UP EVERY DAY AND GO RIGHT AT IT.
Jimmy: AND EVERY -- I FEEL LIKE DIFFERENT PEOPLE ENDORSING EACH OTHER. BERNIE SANDERS JUST GOT ENDORSED BY BEN & JERRY'S.
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.
Jimmy: SO THAT'S BIG.
THAT'S A DELICIOUS ENDORSEMENT.
Jimmy: THAT'S A BIG DEAL. IS IT A BIG DEAL TO GET ENDORSED BY A CERTAIN THING?
WELL, I GOT ENDORSED BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACTION FUND ON SUNDAY. THAT WAS A BIG DEAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BECAUSE I BELIEVE SO STRONGLY THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST THESE EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE AND DEMONIZE THE WORK THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD DOES. AND THEY KNOW THAT I'LL FIGHT FOR THEM, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I INTEND TO DO.
Jimmy: AND THEY WILL -- THEY CHANGE YOUR NUMBERS. WHEN SOMEBODY ENDORSES YOU, PEOPLE GO, "OH."
YEAH, ESPECIALLY -- IF PEOPLE -- THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES. I GOT ENDORSED BY THE BRADY CAMPAIGN BECAUSE OF MY STANCE ON TRYING TO GET COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURES. BECAUSE I BELIEVE STRONGLY -- WHAT THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT APPROACH. SO IF PEOPLE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE AND THEY, FOR EXAMPLE, CARE DEEPLY ABOUT PROTECTING WOMEN'S ACCESS TO ALL OF THEIR HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, THAT IS A VERY MEANINGFUL ENDORSEMENT. IF THEY CARE, AS SO MANY PEOPLE DO TODAY ABOUT THE FACT WE LOSE 90 PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY TO GUN VIOLENCE, THAT'S A A SIGNIFICANT ENDORSEMENT. SO I'M JUST HONORED TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHOSE CAUSES MEAN A LOT TO ME. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT GIVES ME EVEN MORE INCENTIVE TO GO OUT AND DO MY BEST.
Jimmy: YEAH, INTERESTING. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU SAID SOMETHING EARLIER, THEY DON'T JUST GIVE THIS JOB AWAY. YOU REALLY GOT TO WORK FOR THIS JOB.
YOU REALLY HAVE TO WORK.
Jimmy: AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING, THIS IS THE BIGGEST JOB IN THE WORLD. IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE APPLYING FOR THIS JOB.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND WE'RE HIRING YOU.
IT'S LIKE A JOB INTERVIEW.
