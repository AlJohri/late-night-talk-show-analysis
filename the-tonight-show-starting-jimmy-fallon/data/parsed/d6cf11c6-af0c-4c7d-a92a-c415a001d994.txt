Questlove: 294!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY, HEY! OH, MY GOSH. WELCOME, EVERYBODY, TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. THIS IS IT. WE'RE ALL HERE TOGETHER. THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON, OR AS DONALD TRUMP CALLS ME, "NOT A WAR HERO." [ LAUGHTER ] PRETTY MUCH CALLS EVERYONE THAT RIGHT NOW. I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS. DONALD TRUMP GOT IN SOME TROUBLE FOR SAYING THAT JOHN McCAIN IS NOT A WAR HERO AND SAID, QUOTE, "I LIKE PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T CAPTURED." NOT GOOD. IN FACT, TRUMP'S PEOPLE ARE TELLING HIM TO LAY LOW FOR A A WHILE UNTIL THIS ALL COMBS OVER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY!
Jimmy: IT FEELS LIKE EVERYONE IS FOCUSED ON TRUMP RIGHT NOW. IN FACT, RICK PERRY SAID DONALD TRUMP IS UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT AND CALLED FOR HIM TO IMMEDIATELY WITHDRAW FROM THE RACE. AND THEN HE SAID, "AND THAT'S COMING FROM ME." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THAT'S RIGHT. PERRY ACTUALLY SAID TRUMP IS A A TOXIC MIX OF DEMAGOGUERY AND NONSENSE WHO IS UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT. THEN PERRY TOOK HIS GLASSES OFF AND WAS LIKE, "WELL, I THINK THESE THINGS ARE MAGIC. [ LAUGHTER ] DEMAGOGUERY? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IS THAT A WORD?" AND DID YOU SEE THIS? HILLARY CLINTON RECENTLY QUESTIONED UBER'S EMPLOYMENT POLICIES BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES THEIR EMPLOYEES SHOULD HAVE BENEFITS. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH BILL WHO BELIEVES HIS FRIENDS SHOULD HAVE BENEFITS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] VERY INTERESTING. I THOUGHT THIS WAS NICE. LAST WEEK PRESIDENT OBAMA MET WITH THE OLDEST LIVING VETERAN, A 110-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO SERVED IN WORLD WAR II. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S BEEN ROUGH FOR OBAMA, BUT I THINK SHE'S AGING BETTER THAN HE IS. [ LAUGHTER ] A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FREAKED OUT ABOUT THIS. THE DATING WEBSITE ASHLEYMADISON.COM. IS IT A DATING WEBSITE? NO. IT'S A WEBSITE WHERE -- DID YOU KNOW THIS? WHERE MARRIED PEOPLE GO TO HAVE AFFAIRS. YOU GO TO THIS WEBSITE AND YOU HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH SOMEONE. ANYWAY, IT WAS HACKED YESTERDAY, AND NOW THE HACKERS ARE THREATENING TO RELEASE INFORMATION ABOUT ALL OF ITS USERS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH I GUESS IS ONE WAY TO CUT DOWN ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THAT'S ONE WAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M OUT. I'M OUT. TAKE CARE, EVERYBODY. I'M GOOD. SO THE ASHLEY MADISON HACKERS ARE THREATENING TO RELEASE USERS' PHOTOS AND INFORMATION. IN FACT, WE JUST FOUND OUT THAT ONE OF OUR AUDIENCE MEMBERS USED TO BE ON ASHLEY MADISON. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN POINT HIM OUT RIGHT NOW. [ DRUMROLL ] THERE HE -- NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. I'M JUST KIDDING. I'M JUST KIDDING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] A FEW OF YOU LOOKED SCARED. A FEW OF YOU LOOKED SCARED. YOU'RE LIKE, "WAIT, WHOA! OH, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. LET'S GO!" OH, MAN, WE LOVE THIS SHOW. THIS IS CRAZY. DID YOU SEE THE J-BAY OPEN SURFING EVENT IN SOUTH AFRICA? DID YOU SEE THIS? CANCELLED YESTERDAY. THIS IS INSANE. A SHARK TRIED TO ATTACK MICK FANNING, WHO'S A SURFER. MICK FANNING IS HIS NAME. HE SAVED HIMSELF BY PUNCHING THE SHARK IN THE BACK. YEAH, NOT TO BE OUTDONE, I SAW A SPIDER ON MY TOOTHBRUSH YESTERDAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I NOW LIVE IN A HOTEL. BRING THE CAR AROUND! I'M LEAVING. NO, NOT THAT ONE. THE STRETCH. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S AN EMERGENCY, PLEASE. AND FINALLY, I THOUGHT THIS WAS NICE. BRAD PITT RECENTLY REVEALED THE TATTOO ON HIS ARM THAT FEATURES THE INITIALS OF HIS WIFE AND ALL OF THEIR CHILDREN, WHICH SOUNDS SWEET UNTIL YOU REALIZE HE'S USING IT TO REMEMBER HIS KIDS' NAMES. HE'S LIKE, "OH, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH -- TODD." THAT'S FANTASTIC! NO, I MEAN AUDREY. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS EVERYBODY! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT IS GRAMMY AND ACADEMY AWARD WINNING PRODUCER GIORGIO MORODER SITTING IN WITH THE ROOTS TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY! GIORGIO JUST RELEASED HIS FIRST ALBUM IN OVER 30 YEARS CALLED "DEJA VU," WHICH DEBUTED AT NUMBER ONE ON THE BILLBOARD DANCE CHARTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, GIORGIO.

Steve: FUNNY AND A A GENTLEMAN.
Jimmy: HE'S THE GREATEST GUY.
Steve: GREATEST GUY.
Jimmy: HE'S THE FUNNIEST HUMAN BEING EVER AND THE MOVIE IS FANTASTIC. IT'S A BIG ACTION MOVIE, ALIENS ARE TAKING OVER THE EARTH, BUT THE ALIENS ARE OLD VIDEO GAMES. SO IT'S LIKE PAC-MAN AND DONKEY KONG. THEY'RE THE ALIENS COMING, CENTIPEDE. BUT IT'S IN 3D, IT'S AWESOME AND IT'S FUNNY AS IT'S ADAM SANDLER. SO IT'S GOT TO BE FUNNY. AND THEN ADAM AND I ARE GOING TO DO A LIP FLIP, WHICH IS -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S A WEIRD THING. WE'LL DO THAT LATER ON IN THE SHOW. PLUS, HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE VERY, VERY FUNNY NEW MOVIE "TRAINWRECK," WHICH IS FANTASTIC. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HAD A BIG OPENING WEEKEND. HE'S ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THIS NEW FANTASTIC BOOK "SICK IN THE HEAD," WHICH I CAN'T STOP READING. HE INTERVIEWS ALL THESE COMEDIANS IN IT, INCLUDING SANDLER. THEY KNEW EACH OTHER. BUT IT'S FASCINATING. I WANT TO TALK TO JUDD ABOUT THIS. JUDD APATOW IS HERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
Steve: COME ON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: STEVE MARTIN, GARY SHANDLING, JAY LENO, CHRIS ROCK. HE TALKS TO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE AND HE ALSO INTERVIEWED PEOPLE WHEN HE WAS 14. HE PRETENDED TO BE A JOURNALIST FOR SOME NEWSPAPER AND JUST SNUCK -- THIS IS TRUE -- HE SNUCK BACKSTAGE AND TALKED TO THESE COMEDIANS. LIKE LENO AND SEINFELD, THEY ALL TALKED TO HIM FOR AN HOUR AND GAVE HIM INTERVIEWS. SO HE HAS THOSE INTERVIEWS THEN AND THEN HE INTERVIEWS THEM NOW WHEN HE'S 40 OR WHATEVER. HE'S TALKING TO THEM AGAIN. AND SEINFELD SOUNDS THE SAME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE HASN'T CHANGED. HE'S JUST A SMART DUDE BACK THEN. IT'S JUST SO RAD. ANYWAY, JUDD APATOW IS HERE, ADAM SANDLER IS HERE. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: SO JUDD IS COMING ON THE SHOW AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT ALL THE COMEDIANS AND THIS STUFF. WE WERE TALKING. I GO, "YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GREAT, IF YOU --" BECAUSE I KNOW HE DID STAND-UP BACK IN THE DAY. HIM AND SANDLER WOULD GO OUT AND DO STAND-UP TOGETHER. I GO, "WOULD YOU DO STAND-UP ON THE SHOW?" HE GOES, "NO. I MEAN, HAVEN'T DONE STAND-UP COMEDY IN FOREVER. I HAVEN'T DONE -- NO." I GO, "BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT. THE KIDS WATCHING THE SHOW TO SEE WHAT A STAND-UP COMEDIAN DOES, SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN ON THE ROAD AND DONE A LOT OF STAND-UP." AND HE GOES -- THIS IS A MONTH OR A YEAR AGO. HE GOES, "OKAY. LET ME THINK ABOUT THIS." SO HE WENT AND HE'S BEEN WORKING IT OUT AND HE WENT ON THE ROAD AND WENT IN COMEDY CLUBS AND FIGURED OUT AN ACT, AND HE HAS AN ACT. TONIGHT HE'S GOING TO PERFORM STAND-UP COMEDY FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JUDD APATOW IS DOING SOME STAND-UP TONIGHT.
Steve: YEAH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT GUY. THAT'S SO AWESOME THAT HE'S DOING THAT. IT'S A FUN SHOW TONIGHT. GUYS, DO YOU EVER GO ONLINE OR WATCH TV, YOU SEE SOME WEIRD RANDOM THING ON YOUR SCREEN?

EVEN LIKE JOHNNY DEPP'S KID MUST BE LIKE, "OH, GOD, MY DAD WITH THOSE FREAKING SCARVES." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS ISN'T A PIRATE SHIP. IT'S COSTCO, DAD. [ LAUGHTER ] I LIVE WITH THREE WOMEN, THREE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, THREE AGES OF THE SAME WOMAN, ACTUALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M LIKE THE WEIRD GUY IN THE HOUSE, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY THINGS IN COMMON THAT THEY CAN TALK ABOUT. THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR HAIR AND HOW TO MAKE THE CURL LOOK RIGHT AND HOW TO WAX THEIR EYEBROWS. I'M JUST LIKE THE WEIRD GUY JUST GOING, "CAN YOU POP A ZIT ON A TESTICLE?" [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M LIKE KIND OF INTO BEING AN UGLY GUY. I'M VERY PRO UGLY. SO IT'S VERY WEIRD LIVING WITH THREE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. I'M ALWAYS LIKE THE TROLL IN THE CORNER, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] I'M JUST LIKE, "YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE REALLY LIKE YOU WHEN YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE." [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE LIKE ME FOR MY PERSONALITY. BEAUTY FADES, YOU KNOW. PEOPLE ALWAYS LIKE ME. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW MY DAUGHTER'S 17 YEARS OLD. BOYS ARE COMING AROUND. AND EVERY TIME A BOY COMES AROUND, I JUST GENETICALLY WANT TO STRIKE THEM, YOU KNOW. I WANT TO HIT THEM. THEN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE A A BOY WILL SHOW UP WHO'S REALLY LIKE A STRANGE, WEIRD KID. AND SOMETIMES I'LL THINK, "OH, THAT'SME. THAT'S ME IN HIGH SCHOOL." AND I'LL SAY TO MY DAUGHTER, "WHY DIDN'T YOU DATE THAT KID?" SHE'LL GO, "BECAUSE HE'S A A NERD." I'M LIKE, "YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM!" [ LAUGHTER ] "HE'S GOING TO SHOW PEOPLE ONE DAY! HIS BODY IS GOING TO FILL OUT. AND CONTINUE TO FILL OUT." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M VERY PROUD OF THE JEWS. IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE NOT GETTING IN THAT MUCH TROUBLE THESE DAYS. IN THE WORLD WE'RE DOING WELL. WE DON'T MIND IF YOU DRAW US OR DRAW OUR GOD, YOU KNOW. AND WE SHOULD MIND BECAUSE ANY ACCURATE DRAWING OF A JEWISH PERSON IS INHERENTLY ANTI-SEMITIC. [ LAUGHTER ] A PERFECT DRAWING OF ME IS LIKE NAZI PROPAGANDA. [ LAUGHTER ] COSBY IS STILL OUT ON THE ROAD. ISN'T THAT WEIRD? HE'S LIKE DOING STAND-UP. WHAT DO YOU THINK HIS ACT IS LIKE? DO YOU THINK HE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT IT? DO YOU THINK HE SAYS, LIKE -- [ BILL COSBY IMPRESSION ] "YOU EVER BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE WIFE?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "YOU EVER BEEN IN THE DOGHOUSE WITH THE WIFE, DOGHOUSE WITH THE WIFE BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT YOU DID? [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE THE OTHER DAY THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT ME IN THE PAPER AND I DIDN'T WANT MY WIFE TO READ THE PAPER -- SO I GOT UP AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING AND I SNUCK OUT TO THE DRIVEWAY TO GET THE PAPER. AND I HID THE PAPER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE NEXT DAY I GOT UP AND I HID THE PAPER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THE NEXT DAY I FORGOT TO GET THE PAPER! [ LAUGHTER ] AND MY WIFE, SHE SAID TO ME, "WHAT IS THIS IN THE PAPER ABOUT THE RAPING AND THE DRUGGING AND THE WOMEN?" AND I SAID, "DO YOU LIKE YOUR LIFE?" [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OHS ] "DO YOU LIKE THE HOUSE, THE JETS? WELL, THEN HAVE A CAPPUCCINO AND SHUT THE FLOIK UP." [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: JUDD APATOW! WE'RE TALKING TO JUDD APATOW WHEN WE COME BACK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: HEY WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! WE'RE HANGING OUT WITH ADAM SANDLER AND JUDD APATOW! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU AGAIN.
YOU BET.
Jimmy: THANK YOU AGAIN FOR DOING STAND-UP. I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO STAND-UP. YOU'VE DONE STAND-UP FOR A LONG TIME.
WELL, I DID IT FROM THE TIME I WAS 17 UNTIL I WAS 24. AND THEN I STOPPED BECAUSE I KEPT GETTING SIGNALS FROM THE UNIVERSE THAT I SHOULDN'T DO IT. LIKE ONCE ME AND ADAM WE AUDITIONED FOR JIM HENSON, YOU KNOW FROM "THE MUPPETS" TO HOST THE SHOW TOGETHER WHEN WE WERE KIDS. AND I DIDN'T GET IT AND I GET THE CALL, "JIM HENSON WANTS TO BUY ALL YOUR IDEAS BUT HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO HOST THE SHOW BECAUSE HE SAID YOU LACK WARMTH." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THAT LIKE HURT ME BECAUSE THIS IS THE GUY WHO COULD TAKE TWO PING-PONG BALLS AND MAKE THEM A WARM ANIMAL THAT PEOPLE LOVE.
Jimmy: HE'S THE BEST.
THAT'S LIKE MR. ROGERS SAYING YOU DON'T DESERVE LOVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S JIM HENSON. IT DIDN'T COME FROM JIM.
Adam: BUT YOU ARE LIKE SO WARM.
THAT'S WHY IT HURT ME BECAUSE I THOUGHT, IS THERE A A CHANCE THAT HE DIDN'T SAY IT LIKE -- DO YOU THINK HE WAS IN THE MEETING WITH A CASTING COLLECTOR AND SAID, "LET'S CALL JUDD APATOW AND TELL HIM HE LACKS WARMTH."
Jimmy: HE WOULDN'T DO THAT. WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT YOU? DID YOU LACK --
HE SAID TOO JEWISH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. LITTLE BIT TOO JEWISH. ALL RIGHT -- NO NO.
Jimmy: THERE'S A GREAT INTERVIEW HERE WITH YOU AND ADAM IN HERE, 'CAUSE I KNOW YOU GUYS WERE ROOMMATES, YOU STARTED TOGETHER. BUT I CAN'T STOP READING IT AND I THINK WHAT THIS IS LIKE FOR ME, YOU EVER EAT A BOWL OF ICE CREAM AND IT'S SO GOOD AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S ONLY TWO BITES LEFT IN THE BOWL AND YOU LIKE WANT TO SAVE THIS FOREVER. I'M LIKE, "I DON'T WANT THIS BOOK TO END."
OH, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I WANT TO KEEP GOING AND GOING SO I CAN READ IT.
THIS COULD BE THE FIRST BOOK YOU READ TWICE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OR FINISH. OR FINISH. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M WITH YOU ON THAT. I'M WITH YOU BUDDY.
FINISH COMPLETELY ONCE?
Jimmy: I LOVE EVERYTHING. YOU INTERVIEWING HAROLD RAMIS IS A GREAT INTERVIEW. IT WAS JUST FANTASTIC -- HARRY ANDERSON BY THE WAY --
FROM "NIGHT COURT."
Adam: THAT'S THE BEST.
Jimmy: I WENT BACK TO YOUTUBE AND WATCHED THE STANDUP ACT BECAUSE I FORGOT HARRY ANDERSON. HE WAS SO FUNNY. GARY SHANDLING IS AMAZING. BUT YOU WOULD ACT LIKE YOU WERE FROM A PAPER -- NEWSPAPER. YOU WERE 15 OR 14.
HIGH SCHOOL RADIO STATION. I WOULD ASK THEM TO DO AN INTERVIEW FOR A RADIO STATION.
Jimmy: SO YOU WOULDN'T TELL THEM WHAT, WHICH ONE?
NO, THEN I WOULD SHOW UP WITH A GIANT TAPE RECORDER FROM THE AV SQUAD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEY WOULD SEEM CONCERNED AND DISAPPOINTED. AND THEN THEY WOULD BE REALLY NICE BECAUSE I WAS SO ENTHUSIASTIC. PEOPLE KEEP SAYING, WHEN YOU RELEASE AUDIO OF THAT, BUT I DON'T BECAUSE MY VOICE, I HAVE SUCH A LONG ISLAND ACCENT AND MY VOICE HADN'T BROKEN YET. SO IT'S LIKE -- "HOW DO YOU WRITE A JOKE?" [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S TERRIBLE.
Jimmy: BUT IT'S AMAZING TO HEAR HOW NICE EVERYONE WAS. JAY LENO WAS FANTASTIC TO YOU WHEN YOU WERE 14. YOU SAW HIM I WANT TO SAY AT RASCALS COMEDY CLUB.
RASCALS IN WEST ORANGE, NEW JERSEY.
Jimmy: IT'S FASCINATING THAT HE WOULD GIVE THAT MUCH TIME TO A KID WHO'S DOING A RADIO SHOW WHO WAS 14 YEARS OLD --
WELL IT WAS BEFORE THE INTERNET AND PODCASTING. I THINK THEY ALL HAD A LOT OF FREE TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT, SEINFELD HAS NOT CHANGED. AND ALMOST -- I REALLY FEEL LIKE ALMOST YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED. YOUR INTERVIEWS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE INTERVIEWS YOU DO NOW.
WELL, WHEN I GOT TO RE-INTERVIEW EVERYBODY AGAIN WHEN I WAS 46, IT WAS VERY SIMILAR. I WAS JUST LIKE, "HOW DO YOU DO IT?" HOW DO YOU KEEP IT GOING? WHAT INTERESTS YOU NOW THAT YOU'VE ACHIEVED THESE GOALS?" IT WAS FUN TO GO BACK AND DO IT.
Jimmy: IT'S FASCINATING, IT'S GREAT. YOU HAVE ALBERT BROOKS IN HERE. I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO THE PEOPLE AT THE END OF THE BOOK. I KNOW THIS IS NOT IN ORDER. BUT KEY AND PEELE, MARC MARON, YOU GOT BEN STILLER, JIM CARREY, AND SANDLER, AMY SCHUMER HAS A GREAT STORY IN HERE. I JUST LOVE -- ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WERE SAYING IN THERE TO JAY LENO IS THE WHOLE REASON I WANT TO DO MOVIES IS SO THAT I CAN DO "THE TONIGHT SHOW."
THE ONLY REASON I DIRECTED AND WROTE MOVIES WAS SO I HAVE A BETTER CHANCE TO DO -- HANDLING THE "THE TONIGHT SHOW."
Jimmy: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU DID IT. AND I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE BOOK. AND CONGRATS ON "TRAINWRECK." OH MY GOSH, IT'S FANTASTIC. CONGRATS AGAIN ON THAT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU AND HAVE YOU GUYS HERE TOGETHER. THIS MUST BE WEIRD FOR YOU GUYS.
NOT AT ALL. EVERYTHING -- JUDD APATOW. I WAS TALKING TO MY FAMILY YESTERDAY ABOUT HIM. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THE SWEETEST, NICEST, MOST GIVING GUY SINCE WE WERE ROOMMATES AND HE WAS JUST ALWAYS ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE. WE HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE GOING TO BECOME WHATEVER THE HELL YOU ARE RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S THE COOLEST THING EVER. HE'S THE SWEETEST, NICEST GUY, MOST HONEST GUY I KNOW. AND I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, BOY.
Jimmy: WE LOVE YOU, MAN. FANTASTIC. JUDD APATOW, ADAM STANDLER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PICK UP A COPY OF "SICK IN THE HEAD," AVAILABLE NOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. COME ON BACK TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." ♪♪
Jimmy: MY THANKS TO ADAM SANDLER, JUDD APATOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GIORGIO MORODER RIGHT THERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THE ROOTS FROM PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA.
