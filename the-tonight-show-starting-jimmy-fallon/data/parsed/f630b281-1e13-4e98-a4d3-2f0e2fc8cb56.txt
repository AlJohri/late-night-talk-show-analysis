YEAH.
Jimmy: "I'LL PRETEND I'M JACK." AND DO THEY DO THAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT, I ACTUALLY HAD A --
Jimmy: I WOULD DO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
THERE WAS A -- THIS IS A A WHOLE OTHER STORY BUT THERE WAS A WARRANT OUT FOR MY ARREST. I JUST DIDN'T --
Jimmy: FOR REAL?
LIKE I DIDN'T PUT IN THE PAPER.
Jimmy: THERE'S A WARRANT OUT FOR YOUR ARREST?
YEAH MY CAR WASN'T REGISTERED IN TIME AND SO THE THING WASN'T ON THERE. AND THE GUY PULLED ME OVER. I'M DRIVING A MAZDA LIKE UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT AND HE PULLS ME OVER. AND YOU KNOW, SAID WHAT IT'S FOR. AND I WAS LIKE, REALLY? AND THEN HE THOUGHT I WAS MAKING FUN OF HIM. SO HE'S LIKE, "GET OUT OF THE CAR." AND THEN HE RECOGNIZED ME. THANK GOD, THAT TOTALLY SAVED ME FROM BEING PUT IN THE SLAMMER FOR BEING A SMART ASS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO HE'S LIKE, "OH YOU'RE THE COMPUTER GIRL FROM THAT SHOW." AND THEN HE SAYS, "OH YEAH, MY FRIENDS CALL ME JACK BAUER." [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, THANK GOD I HELD MY TONGUE BECAUSE INSIDE I WAS LIKE, OH YEAH REALLY? YOU MEAN YOU MAKE YOUR FRIENDS CALL YOU JACK BAUER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW HE'S IN THE SHOWER LIKE, YOU KNOW, "I'M JACK BAUER." I'M PRETTY. LIKE HE'S IN THE MIRROR. LIKE NO, YOU'RE PULLING OVER LIKE A FULL GROWN WOMEN VERY DRIVING A MAZDA FOR HAVING HER EXPIRED REGISTRATION. LIKE YOU'RE NOT JACK BAUER DUDE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT WOULD BE THE BEST EPISODE OF "24" EVER. "YOU GOT TO PULL OVER RIGHT NOW. THERE'S A WARRANT OUT FOR YOUR ARREST."
JACK BAUER WILL CHOKE A MAN OUT JUST TO GET THROUGH A A CORRIDOR. DID YOU DO THAT THIS MORNING? NO. HE SAID, EXCUSE ME PLEASE. JACK BAUER WOULDN'T THAT.
Jimmy: BUT YOU GOT AWAY WITH IT.
I GOT AWAY WITH IT.
Jimmy: SEE? SO JACK BAUER.
YEAH, SAVED ME ONCE AGAIN.
Jimmy: YEAH. DID YOU THANK HIM? DID YOU THANK THE OFFICER?
I WAS LIKE, "THANK YOU OFFICER RODRIGUEZ. I MEAN JACK BAUER." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE WAS LIKE, "YES! COOL!" HE'S LIKE TWEETED EVERYBODY. "COOL THEY CALL ME JACK BAUER. I TOLD YOU GUYS." BUT NOW "24", WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING RIGHT? WHAT IT'S ABOUT AND ALL THAT STUFF FOR SPOILERS, IS THAT RIGHT?
IT'S KIND OF LIKE "SPIDER-MAN" A LITTLE BIT. I DON'T' KNOW.
Jimmy: NOT LIKE "SPIDER-MAN."
NO.
Jimmy: CHLOE'S BACK. I SAW THE POSTER. AND THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT CHLOE THIS TIME.
SHE'S IN A BAD WAY.
Jimmy: WHAT HAPPENED?
SHE HAS BECOME VERY ANTI-GOVERNMENT. SHE'S WORKING FOR AN ORGANIZATION SIMILAR TO WIKI LEAKS, GIVING OUT GOVERNMENT SECRETS. SHE SUFFERS PERSONAL TRAGEDY. SO SHE'S HEAVILY TATTOOED AND PIERCED AND A LOT OF BLACK EYE LINER.
Jimmy: YEAH, TOTALLY DIFFERENT CHLOE. OH I'M VERY EXCITED.
SHE'S FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS.
Jimmy: OH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS. I'M SO EXCITED TO WATCH THIS "24." YOU'RE MY FAVORITE, PAL. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP OF MARY LYNN RAJSKUB IN "24, LIVE ANOTHER DAY." TAKE A LOOK.

THEY'RE PLANNING A FULL SCALE ATTACK?
