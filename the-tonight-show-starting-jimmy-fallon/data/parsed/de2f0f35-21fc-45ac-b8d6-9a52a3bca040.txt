I GOT DAD IN THERE, TOO.
Jimmy: WHAT'S THAT?
I GOT DAD IN THERE, TOO.
Jimmy: YOU GOT DAD IN THERE TOO. AND YOU SAID, "HEY, IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A MOTHER AND FATHER THAT LOVE YOU AND THEY'RE AROUND, CALL THEM. DON'T E-MAIL THEM, DON'T TEXT THEM." RIGHT?
YOU DID MEMORIZE IT.
Jimmy: I DID. I KIND OF DID. I HAVE IT TATTOOED ON MY LOWER BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT IT LATER JUST TO MAKE SURE I GOT IT WORD FOR WORD. BUT THEN, YOU WENT ON. IT WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL. IT WAS A GOOD WAY -- IT'S A A CLASSY NIGHT, THE ACADEMY AWARDS. IT WAS JUST A CLASSY WAY TO START IT OFF. THAT WAS NICE OF YOU TO DO THAT, AND THEN OF COURSE, YOU THANKED YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE, WHO YOU'VE MARRIED ALMOST 20 YEARS NOW, IS THAT CORRECT?
IT'LL BE 20 YEARS IN SEPTEMBER, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NOW, I KNOW WHY SHE WOULD FALL FOR A GUY LIKE YOU. I GO, "OH, HE'S TALENTED." THEN I SAW A PICTURE OF WHERE YOU FIRST MET. YOU MET DOING "PETER PAN" ON BROADWAY.
YES, WE DID.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND YOU WERE -- OH, MAN. THIS IS REALLY COOL. HERE'S YOU AND YOUR WIFE. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] COME ON. LOOK AT THAT RIGHT THERE. YEAH. THERE SHE IS. THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO.
I WAS GETTING A LITTLE HANDSY, THERE.
Jimmy: YOU GOT A LITTLE HANDSY, YEAH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT THAT'S SWEET. YOU JUST MET. YOU MET AND FELL IN LOVE THERE?
WE HAD THE SAME HAIR, SO -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AH, WELL, YOU GOT A A GOOD VOICE. YOU GOT THE BEST VOICE FOR THEATER. BUT ALSO, THAT'S WHY THESE GUYS WANT YOU IN THE ANIMATED MOVIES, BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A A GOOD VOICE. SO HERE YOU ARE IN THE NEW "KUNG FU PANDA 3." THIS IS ANGELINA JOLIE, JACK BLACK, OBVIOUSLY. EVERYONE IS COMING BACK. BUT YOU'RE NEW. KATE HUDSON IS NEW, AND BRYAN CRANSTON IS NEW.
MM-HMM.
Jimmy: AND YOU PLAY KAI? YOU'RE A VILLAIN.
I'M THE SCARY BAD GUY.
Jimmy: OH, OKAY, YEAH. I WAS LIKE, "DO YOU PLAY KAI?" [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE A CUTE LITTLE --
NO, YEAH. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT KAI IS.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A LITLE BABY PANDA. YEAH, YEAH, NO. NO, YOU'RE NOT THE BABY.
NO, CRANSTON GETS TO BE A A PANDA. I'M A GIANT SCARY-LOOKING OX THING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. WOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR VOICE FOR THAT?
WELL, I MEAN, WHEN THEY FIRST ASKED ME TO DO IT, THE ONLY QUESTION I ASKED WAS, "IT ALL THE SAME TEAM?" YOU KNOW, THE WRITERS AND DIRECTORS AND PRODUCERS. AND IT IS. AND I THOUGHT THE FIRST TWO MOVIES WERE SO GOOD, AND THE ACTORS.
Jimmy: YOUR VOICE IS A A FRIENDLY VOICE. I WOULDN'T CAST YOU AS A A VILLAIN.
WELL, BUT AT LEAST I GOT THE LOW VOICE.
Jimmy: "YEAH. I'M A BULL." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
SO THAT WAS MY THOUGHT. I WOULD GO TO MY JAMES EARL JONES DARTH VADER LAND.
Jimmy: YEAH!
SEE IF THAT WAS KIND OF WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.
Jimmy: NICE REFERENCE! I LOVE THAT. YEAH, I KNOW THAT ONE. I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP. HERE'S J.K. SIMMONS AS THE VILLAIN, KAI, IN "KUNG FU PANDA 3." CHECK THIS OUT.
KAI HAS RETURNED!
