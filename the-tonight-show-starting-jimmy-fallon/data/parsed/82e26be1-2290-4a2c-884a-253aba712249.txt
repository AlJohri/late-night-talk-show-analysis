Jimmy: ROUNDING IT UP. NO, NO. YOU HAVE A GREAT FACE FOR A A MAGAZINE.
NO, I DO -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DO NOT HAVE THE MUSCLE MASS TO EVEN DO AN IMPRESSION OF A A WRESTLER. EVEN A SARCASTIC ONE.
Jimmy: YES, SO YOU HAVE THIS HERE. I'M VERY, VERY EXCITED ABOUT -- I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T -- YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH --
WELL NO. BECAUSE THEY SAID -- WHEN I HAD TO GO TO THE LAUNCH OF THIS MAGAZINE COVER, AND SO THEY SAID, "WHAT'S IT LIKE?" AND SO I SAID, "HONESTLY, IT MAKES ME FEEL SLIGHTLY NAUSEOUS. IT MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE IN A A WAY THAT IS NOT EASY TO ARTICULATE TO YOU. AND I LOOKED UP AT THE GUY INTERVIEWING ME AND HIS FACE WAS LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER WE'RE LOOKING FOR. SO I JUST SAID, "IT'S A HUGE HONOR." AND HE SAID, "YES, THAT'S BETTER." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. LET ME SHOW YOU HOW COMFORTABLE YOU ARE AT THE PRESS EVENT FOR "THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER."
OH NO!
Jimmy: LOOK AT THAT FACE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHO IS THAT? WHO IS -- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU THERE? THAT IS A MAN IN HIS OWN PERSONAL HELL. BUT I BET THEY SOLD LESS PORSCHES THE DAY AFTER THAT PHOTO WAS TAKEN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. THAT MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD.
YEAH,. OH, IT'S WEIRD.
Jimmy: BUT IT PREMIERS THIS SUNDAY. ARE YOU EXCITED? ARE YOU NERVOUS?
I'M EXCITED. BUT REMEMBER, I DID THE LAST -- YOUR LAST TEST SHOW BEFORE "THE TONIGHT SHOW" STARTED.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. WE DID A WEEK OF SHOWS TESTING JUST TO MAKE SURE THE LIGHTS WORK AND THE CAMERAS WORK.
YEAH, AND I REMEMBER YOU THEN. YOU WERE EXCITED, BUT WITH A A SLIGHTLY HIGHER REGISTER OF VOICE. JUST, "YES, GOOD, YES! CAN'T WAIT FOR IT!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD IMPRESSION. NOT BAD.
THAT KIND OF PANICKED, HIGH PITCHED EXCITEMENT OF, "YEAH, I'M LOOKING IN ORDER TO SUNDAY! IT'S SOON, ISN'T IT?"
Jimmy: IT SORT OF FEELS LIKE IT, YEAH.
IT'S REALLY SOON. SO YEAH, HOPEFULLY, IT WILL BE GOOD. I'M NOT PANICKING.
Jimmy: I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE FANTASTIC. IS THE SET BUILT? IS EVERYTHING BUILT?
YEAH, IT WILL BE FINE. IT'LL BE FINE. IT'S GOOD! THERE'S GOING TO BE A SET, YES! IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT! YEAH, IT'S JUST, AS LONG AS IT'S NOT TERRIBLE. THAT WILL BE GREAT.
Jimmy: IT WILL NOT BE TERRIBLE IF YOU'RE INVOLVED. BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. YOU'RE A SMART GUY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BECAUSE YOU'RE A GREAT WRITER AS WELL AS A PERFORMER.
YOU SOUND LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF MY PARENTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE FANS OF YOURS FROM "THE DAILY SHOW."
AW, THANK YOU, JIMMY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I HAVE TO SHOW THIS CLIP BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR LAST "DAILY SHOW."
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU GOT A BIT EMOTIONAL.
I DID GET A LITTLE BIT EMOTIONAL.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU GOT A A LITTLE --
I GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A TEAR IN ME EYE.
Jimmy: WELL, I MEAN, YOU DID -- I WANT TO -- CAN WE JUST SHOW THE CLIP?
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: LET'S SHOW THE CLIP. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AW.
I LOVE THAT, MAN. THAT WAS HARD. THAT WAS A HARD DAY.
Jimmy: WHY WERE YOU THAT EMOTIONAL?
I WORKED THERE FOR SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS. HE'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. THEY DID THIS LITTLE SURPRISE FOR ME WHERE --
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN?
I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING A A DIFFERENT SHOW. AND THEN HE KIND OF BROKE INTO IT, AND THEY PLAYED A LITTLE VIDEO OF MY TIME THERE. AND I THOUGHT I WAS OKAY UNTIL HE SAYS, "ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?" AND THAT'S WHEN I BURST INTO TEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] I COULD TELL -- I COULD TELL THE MINUTE -- THE MINUTE THAT WENT OUT. BECAUSE IN ENGLAND, IT'S ON 24 HOURS LATER. AND THE MINUTE IT WENT OUT, I COULD TELL BECAUSE I STARTED GETTING THESE ABUSIVE TEXTS FROM MY FRIENDS BACK HOME GOING, "OH, YOU ARE NOT CRYING ON AMERICAN TV. TELL ME THIS GETS FUNNY SOON. LOSE THIS NUMBER. NEVER CALL ME AGAIN." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO. WELL, WE LIKE EMOTION HERE IN AMERICA.
YEAH, WE'RE SUSPICIOUS OF EMOTION. IT'S WEAKNESS.
YOU CONSIDER IT WEAKNESS? ABSOLUTELY.
IT IS A HUGE WEAKNESS. YOU'RE BRINGING SHAME UPON YOUR FAMILY NAME TO SHOW EMOTION OF ANY COLOR.
Jimmy: I DO WANT TO SAY THOUGH ALSO, BECAUSE YOU'RE AN AMERICAN.
WELL, I'M A PRE-1770 AMERICAN, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT YOU DO -- YOU DO -- YOU'RE NOT A CITIZEN OF AMERICA.
NO, YOU SOUND LIKE AN IMMIGRATION OFFICER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS IT YOU HATE ABOUT THIS COUNTRY?
Jimmy: BECAUSE I SAY -- MORE OF A -- YOU DO GREAT THINGS FOR OUR COUNTRY. FOR INSTANCE, I KNOW THE FIRST ACT YOU DID STAND UP FOR THE TROOPS.
I DID, I WENT TO AFGHANISTAN.
Jimmy: YOU DID. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?
AFGHANISTAN? OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL, JIMMY. [ LAUGHTER ] I DID HAVE THE STRANGEST HECKLER I'VE EVER HAD DOING ANY GIG ANYWHERE. IT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME THE AUDIENCE WOULD BE QUITE AS HEAVILY ARMED AS THEY WERE. SO I WALKED OUT FOR THE FIRST GIG. IT'S LIKE 200 PEOPLE. EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAD A A MACHINE GUN ON THEIR LAP. AND YOU LOOK OUT AND YOU GO, "THAT IS DIFFERENT." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS ONE GUY IN THE FRONT HAD HIS FINGER ON THE TRIGGER. THE WHOLE GIG, ON THE TRIGGER. EVENTUALLY, I SAID TO HIM, "DOES YOUR FINGER HAVE TO BE ON THE TRIGGER NOW? DOES IT HAVE TO BE ON THE TRIGGER RIGHT NOW?" HE JUST LOOKED UP AND HE JUST SAID, "NOPE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE LEFT HIS FINGER --
