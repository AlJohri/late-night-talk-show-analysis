IT'S CLOSE.
Jimmy: CLOSE. SO "LET'S MOVE" NOW. FIVE YEARS LATER. AND THE NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. CHILDHOOD OBESITY, NUMBERS ARE DOWN.
WELL, WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THEY'RE NOT INCREASING. AND THE RATES AMONG OUR YOUNGEST ARE STARTING TO DECLINE. SO, WE'VE STARTED TO SHIFT THE CULTURE. I MEAN, YOU GUYS SEE IT AROUND. FAST FOOD CHAINS, THEY'RE REPLACING FRENCH FRIES AND SODAS.
Jimmy: WITH APPLES AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
APPLE SLICES. IT'S JUST GIVING FAMILIES MORE CHOICES. THE SCHOOL LUNCHES HAVE IMPROVED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
KIDS ARE -- [ APPLAUSE ] YEAH.
Jimmy: I REMEMBER THAT GROWING UP. I'M SO HAPPY THAT'S CHANGING. FOR MY DAUGHTERS.
SO IT'S REALLY JUST -- I'M JUST PROUD OF THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE SORT OF CATCHING ON TO THE CULTURAL SHIFT. AND THE MARKET WILL FOLLOW. BECAUSE IF WE DEMAND HEALTHIER PRODUCTS FOR OUR FAMILIES, THE COMPANIES WILL PROVIDE IT. SO WE'RE MAKING THIS A MOVEMENT AND THE "GIMME FIVE" INITIATIVE IS THE CAMPAIGN WE'RE DOING, IS TO CELEBRATE THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY.
Jimmy: YEAH, "GIMME FIVE."
SO WE'RE CHALLENGING PEOPLE.
Jimmy: YES, SO YOU CHALLENGED ME TO GIVE YOU FIVE MOM DANCES.

YEAH.
Jimmy: I ALWAYS OF COURSE THOUGHT IT WAS THE EASTER EGG ROLL. WHICH IS NOT -- WHICH IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING. EGG ROLL. IT COMES IN A GIANT EGG ROLL, EVERYONE EATS AN EGG ROLL.
EGG ROLL.
Jimmy: WHAT? BECAUSE IT'S ALSO INVOLVED WITH "LET'S MOVE" AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF HOW MUCH MOVEMENT GOES ON -- WHAT EVEN IS AN EGG ROLL?
WHAT IS AN EGG ROLL? YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT AN EASTER EGG HUNT, CORRECT?
NO, IT'S NOT A HUNT. IT'S AN ACTUAL ROLL. IT'S PART OF WHITE HOUSE TRADITION. THIS IS ACTUALLY THE LARGEST EVENT THAT WE DO OUTSIDE ON THE SOUTH LAWN. 35,000 GUESTS COME THROUGH, AND IT'S REALLY KIDS. IT'S FUN. WE THEMED IT AFTER "GIMME FIVE." SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF ACTIVITY AND COOKING SESSIONS. BUT THERE'S AN ACTUAL ROLL. SO LITTLE KIDS HAVE A SPOON. THIS IS TRADITION. SO DON'T ASK ME WHY. IT'S A WOODEN SPOON. AND THEY START AT THE BEGINNING LINE AND THEY PUSH AN EGG TO THE FINISH LINE. THEY'RE RUNNING. THEY'RE --
Jimmy: CURRENTLY AIRING ON ESPN 4. [ LAUGHTER ] THE CHILDREN'S ROLLING OF THE EGGS.

Jimmy: 12 EGGS. A DOZEN EGGS. YOU HARD BOIL 10 OF THEM -- OR EIGHT OF THEM. AND FOUR ARE RAW.
OKAY.
Jimmy: AND THEN ONE AT A A TIME, YOU AND THE PRESIDENT SMASH THEM ON YOUR HEAD. WHOEVER SMASHES TWO RAW EGGS LOSES.
YEAH. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME --
Jimmy: COME ON, MICHELLE. YOU CAN DO IT. I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT.
WE CAN DO IT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME TO SMASH THEM ON A A KID'S HEAD.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, NO.
WHICH WOULDN'T BE SUCH A A GOOD LOOK FOR THE PRESIDENT SMASHING A RAW EGG ON THE HEAD OF A 3-YEAR-OLD.
Jimmy: BUT JIMMY FALLON CAN DO IT. YOU CAN FLY ME OVER. I CAN DO IT. I DON'T CARE. JUST TELL A KID GO WASH HIS HAIR. YEAH, EXACTLY.
I THINK WE'LL STICK TO THE SPOON.
Jimmy: STICK TO THE SPOON. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AND GUYS, ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO REMIND YOU PLEASE, #GIMMEFIVE AND #MOMDANCING. MOM DANCING? MOMDANCE. I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR COMING ON OUR PROGRAM AGAIN.

PERFORMANCES BEGIN APRIL 15th AT THE LUNT-FONTANNE THEATRE. PLEASE WELCOME MATTHEW MORRISON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
YES, YES!
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW.
OH, MY GOD. MY ABSOLUTE PLEASURE. I'M SUCH A FAN.
Jimmy: NO, I MEAN, PLEASE, RIGHT BACK AT YOU. THIS IS EXCITING BECAUSE YOU STARTED ON BROADWAY. AND THEN YOU WENT OVER TO "GLEE." AND THAT BECAME THE BIGGEST THING IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. NOW YOU'RE BACK ON BROADWAY. HOW'S IT FEEL?
I'VE BEEN DREAMING OF THIS MOMENT THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. MY LAST SHOW WAS IN 2 2008 DOING "SOUTH PACIFIC." YOU KNOW, "GLEE" WAS AWESOME, HAD AN INCREDIBLE RUN THERE. BUT YOU KNOW, I REALIZED WHEN I WAS THERE, THAT THIS WAS MY HOME. THIS IS THE PLACE I REALLY THRIVE AND WHERE I WANTED TO BE. SO IT WAS JUST SO EXCITING TO BE BACK ON BROADWAY.
Jimmy: DID YOU FORGET HOW HARD IT IS?
WELL, HONESTLY --
Jimmy: IT'S REALLY -- PEOPLE DO IT AND THEY GO, "OH, THIS IS REALLY GRUELING."
I WAS DOING A LOT OF THAT. YOU KNOW, TALKING BACK AND FORTH FROM L.A. WITH THE DIRECTOR, CHOREOGRAPHER AND STUFF. AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO DO AND STUFF?" I WAS LIKE, "THROW EVERYTHING AT ME," YOU KNOW? CHOREOGRAPHY, LET'S DO -- THROW ME AROUND. YOU KNOW, THE CRAZIEST PHYSICALITY YOU CAN EVEN IMAGINE. BUT I WAS USING MY BIG BOY VOICE. AND IN MY HEAD, I WAS STILL 26 YEARS OLD. SO NOW IT'S A LOT OF ICE BATHS AND HEATING PADS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOT SO GLAMOROUS WHEN YOU GET HOME. YEAH, NO.
MY WIFE IS LIKE, "WHERE DID YOU GET THAT BRUISE FROM TODAY?"
Jimmy: BUT IT'S BASED ON THE FILM "FINDING NEVERLAND"?
YEAH, YEAH. WHICH IS A GREAT FILM STARRING JOHNNY DEPP AND KATE WINSLET.
Jimmy: I CRIED MY BRAINS OUT. THAT WAS SO AWESOME. BEAUTIFUL MOVIE.
THIS SHOW IS --
Jimmy: I DID. [ LAUGHTER ] I COULDN'T HELP IT BECAUSE THE LITTLE BOY IN IT -- DO YOU REMEMBER THE ACTOR'S NAME? I FORGET.
I DON'T. YEAH, THAT GUY.
Jimmy: HE WAS AMAZING. NOW HE'S OLDER, YEAH. HE STILL MAKES ME CRY WHEN I SEE HIM.
BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS IS, I FEEL LIKE THIS SHOW IS ALWAYS MEANT TO BE A A MUSICAL, NOW THAT I LOOK AT IT, BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH -- THE CRAZIEST THING HE DID IN THAT MOVIE WAS PUT A SPOON ON HIS NOSE. AND HE WAS CRAZY. BUT NOW WE GET TO KIND OF GO INTO THAT WORLD AND JUST -- YOU KNOW, THEATER IS WHERE THE IMAGINATION IS.
Jimmy: OH, IT'S A GORGEOUS SET. AND YOU HAVE -- LOOK AT THIS. KELSEY GRAMMER IS PLAYING --
KELSEY GRAMMER RIGHT THERE.
Jimmy: CAPTAIN HOOK, RIGHT THERE. BUT THERE'S A LOT GOING ON. AND YOU'RE ON STAGE THE WHOLE TIME.
YEAH, I NEVER LEAVE THE STAGE. I HAVE TWO LITTLE MOMENTS. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO CHANGE AND STUFF. I JUST GO OFF, RUN OFF. EVERYTHING'S VELCRO.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW QUICK CHANGES.
Jimmy: I KNOW QUICK CHANGES FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." BUT, OH, MAN, I CANNOT -- THIS IS GOING TO BE SO FUN. I KNOW YOU'VE GOT ALL YOUR MOVES FROM A VIDEOTAPE WE FOUND CALLED "SIMPLY FUNK." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
WOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: EVERYONE HAD A COPY OF "SIMPLY FUNK." WHAT IS THIS? WHAT WAS THIS? WHY ARE YOU ON THE COVER? WHAT IS HAPPENING? [ LAUGHTER ]
HOW YOU DUG THIS -- I WAS AT NYU AND MY DANCE TEACHER, BOB RIZZO --
Jimmy: YEAH. "BOB RIZZO'S SIMPLY FUNK."
YEAH, HE DID DANCE INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS. AND HE ASKED ME TO DO IT. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BIGGEST THING EVER. I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I'M ON A VHS TAPE." YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] AND ONE THAT YOU CAN'T RECORD OVER IT, YOU KNOW? LIKE, IT WAS AWESOME.
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT LITTLE SQUARE.
YEAH, THE THING YOU POP.
Jimmy: I KNOW THAT THING. YEAH. YOU'RE ON A VHS TAPE. YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.
I ACTUALLY -- THIS WAS MY OWN WARDROBE. I RODE THE SUBWAY IN THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT TOOK LOCAL STOPS, TOO. SO IT WAS -- YEAH. DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE WARDROBE DEPARTMENT THAT PUT ME IN THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, I WISH WE COULD SHOW A CLIP OF IT. BUT WE CAN'T.
GREAT.
