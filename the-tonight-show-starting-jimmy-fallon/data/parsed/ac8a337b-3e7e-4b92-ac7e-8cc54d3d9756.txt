THE LIST NEVER ENDS. IT'S MICHAEL CAINE, MARK RUFFALO, JESSE EISENBERG --
Jimmy: WOODY HARRELSON.
YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
I GOT TO SAY THOUGHT, AMONGST THE CAST, ONE PERSON THAT STOOD OUT AS POTENTIALLY THE MOST GIVING ACTOR OF ALL TIME, AND THAT'S MARK RUFFALO. HE --
Jimmy: THIS IS A CRAZY STORY. AND YOU ACTUALLY BROUGHT US A A BONUS CLIP, BUT TELL US THE STORY FIRST.
YEAH, SO, WE WERE DOING WHAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST INTENSE SCENE IN THE MOVIE WHERE WE PULL RUFFALO OUT OF THE RIVER, AND HE'S COUGHING, AND HE'S SPITTING UP WATER. AND SO, WE DO MARK'S COVERAGE FIRST, AND HE KILLS IT PER USUAL, AND SO --
Jimmy: HE'S A GREAT ACTOR.
HE'S THE BEST. SO THEN, WE TURN THE CAMERA AROUND ON THE REST OF US TO GET OUR REACTIONS.
Jimmy: SO HE'S NOT EVEN ON CAMERA.
EXACTLY. SO, WE PULL MARK OUT OF THE RIVER, AND EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT ON CAMERA, HE'S STILL GIVING IT 100% LIKE THE PRO HE IS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE BREAKS CHARACTER, AND HE STARTS YELLING. SO, WE ALL FREEZE, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, AND WE SLOWLY REALIZE THAT HE'S COMMITTED SO HARD TO THE MOMENT THAT HE'S ACTUALLY PUKED ON HIMSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE --
Jimmy: MARK IS COMING ON SOON, RIGHT? AND SO WE GOT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT THIS.
YES, I THINK WE HAVE THE CLIP OF OUR REACTION TO SAID PUKE. [ LAUGHTER ]

OH!

OKAY. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP?
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S COMMITMENT RIGHT THERE.
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE ELSE IN THE BUSINESS WHO WOULD PUKE OFF CAMERA FOR YOU JUST SO YOU COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO REACT TO.
Jimmy: NO, HE'S THE BEST. I LOVE THAT GUY. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO IN THIS ONE? THIS IS -- YOU'RE GOING AGAINST A TECH MOGUL --
RIGHT, YES, SO IN THE FIRST ONE, THE FOUR HORSEMAN, THE MAGICIANS WERE IN CONTROL THE WHOLE TIME. WE'RE ALWAYS, LIKE, ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE AUDIENCE. IN THIS ONE, EVERYTHING SHIFTS. SO SOMEONE'S NOW PLAYING A A TRICK ON US. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO IT IS AND TRYING TO FIGURE HOW TO REGAIN CONTROL. Jimmy: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLIP HERE. HERE'S DAVE FRANCO IN "NOW YOU SEE ME 2." CHECK THIS OUT.

[ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE GOT. IT COULD ALL END TOMORROW. EVEN MOTHER NATURE'S WORKING AGAINST US. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS, BUT APPARENTLY, THE POLAR ICE CAPS ARE MELTING. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY SAY THAT IN 15 YEARS FROM NOW, THE OCEANS ARE GOING TO RISE THREE FEET. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN? THIS MEANS THAT IN JUST OVER 14 1/2 YEARS FROM NOW, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PULL MY PICNIC TABLE BACK FOUR FEET. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] UNACCEPTABLE. UNACCEPTABLE. GLOBAL WARMING'S DANGEROUS. I COULD THROW MY BACK OUT, GANG. [ LAUGHTER ] SIR, IF YOU COULD LOOK AWAY, I DON'T LIKE YOUR EYES. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, YOU GOTTA RESPECT NATURE. LOOK, I AM A NATURE SHOW GUY. THAT'S ALL I DO.

I SAW ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CLIPS I EVER DID SEE IN MY WHOLE LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE IT WITH YOU, OKAY? CHECK IT OUT. IT WAS A BALD EAGLE. AMERICA'S BIRD. A BALD EAGLE UP IN A PINE TREE. WELL, IT WASN'T COMPLETELY BALD. IT WAS LIKE A COMB-OVER EAGLE. [ LAUGHTER ] COMB-OVER EAGLE IN A PINE TREE GLIDES OVER THE SURFACE OF A A LAKE. THREE FEET OVER THE SURFACE OF A LAKE. ITS GREAT BIG GOLDEN TALONS COME OUT, RIGHT? WHAM! RIGHT IN THE WATER. PULLS UP A GIANT SALMON. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S A SILENT "L" IN SALMON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DO I KNOW? I LEARNED IT IN SCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ] COMB-OVER EAGLE. GIANT SALMON. ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN MY LIFE. I THOUGHT, "I WANT THAT MOMENT FOR ME." SO THIS IS WHAT I DID. I WENT UP TO A NATIONAL PARK. I RENTED MYSELF A HANG GLIDER. [ LAUGHTER ] I STOPPED IN AT 7-ELEVEN, I BOUGHT MYSELF A BAG OF BUGLES. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I PUT ONE OF THOSE LITTLE WITCH HATS ON EVERY FINGER. I GLIDED OVER THE SURFACE OF THE LAKE AND WHAM! I DIDN'T GET A GIANT SALMON, BUT LUCKY FOR ME THERE WAS A A LITTLE SWEDISH BOY KAYAKING. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT IN THE EYES. RIGHT IN THE EYES. DELICIOUS. WE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF NATURE THOUGH, GANG. 'CAUSE IF WE DON'T, WE MIGHT GO EXTINCT. RIGHT, JIMMY? THE WAY THE DINOSAURS DID. SOME PEOPLE THINK DINOSAURS WENT EXTINCT FROM THE ICE AGE, FROM METEORS. NO. DINOSAURS WENT EXTINCT BECAUSE DINOSAURS WERE EATEN BY ROCKS. [ LAUGHTER ] THINK ABOUT IT. EVERY TIME YOU CUT OPEN A ROCK, THERE IS A DAMN DINOSAUR. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE A THEORY THAT DINOSAURS AREN'T TRULY EXTINCT. THAT'S RIGHT. I SAID IT. IT IS MY BELIEF. THAT WHEN HUMAN BEINGS GET UP OVER 75 YEARS OF AGE, THEY TURN INTO VELOCIRAPTORS. [ LAUGHTER ] THINK ABOUT IT. YOU GET INTO YOUR LATE 70s. YOUR BACK STARTS TO HUNCH OVER. YOUR LEGS START TO BOW OUT. YOU START WALKING AROUND REAL FUNNY. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET ARTHRITIS IN YOUR HANDS. YOUR EYES START BUGGING OUT. YOU START LOOKING AROUND AT STUFF AT THE MALL FOR NO REASON.
