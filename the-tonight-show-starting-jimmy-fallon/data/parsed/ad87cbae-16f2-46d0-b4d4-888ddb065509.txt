Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU. OH! THAT IS A HOT CROWD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S AMAZING RIGHT THERE. HEY! RIGHT BACK AT YOU, MAN. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, BABY! THIS IS IT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE SHOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. TONIGHT WAS THE LIGHTING OF THE ROCKEFELLER CENTER CHRISTMAS TREE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WAITED FOR HOURS IN THE COLD JUST TO GO, "COOL. BACK TO THE HOTEL, LET'S GO BACK TO THE HOTEL." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "THAT WAS GOOD. THAT WAS GOOD." [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S -- ACTUALLY THE ROCKEFELLER TREE LIGHTING WAS LIKE ANY OTHER TREE LIGHTING. EVERYONE HELPED FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, AND ONE MOM HAD TO FINISH THE REST BY HERSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] "DON'T EAT THE POPCORN! IT'S FOR THE TREE! FORGET IT." MEANWHILE, THE OBAMAS JUST HAD THE WHITE HOUSE DECORATED FOR THEIR FINAL CHRISTMAS BEFORE THEY LEAVE. THEY WANT TO MAKE IT LOOK NICE FOR SANTA, SINCE HE'S NOT COMING BACK FOR AT LEAST FOUR YEARS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS YEAR -- THIS YEAR'S WHITE HOUSE HOLIDAY DISPLAY ALSO INCLUDES 56 LEGO GINGERBREAD HOUSES, WHICH IS TOOK OVER 200,000 LEGO TO MAKE. OR AS JOE BIDEN PUT IT, "THIS GINGERBREAD IS CRUNCHY AS HELL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "YOU'RE EATING A LEGO." "IT DOESN'T EVEN TASTE LIKE GINGERBREAD!" THEY USED OVER 200,000 LEGOS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE CHRISTMAS DISPLAY. AFTER HEARING THIS, DONALD TRUMP HEARD SAID, "SAVE THOSE LEGOS. WE CAN USE THEM FOR THE WALL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "SAVE THEM. WE NEED IT. WE NEED EVERY LEGO. AT THE VERY LEAST, THEY REALLY HURT TO STEP ON IF THEY COME OVER BAREFOOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. IT HURTS WHEN YOU STEP ON THEM." [ LAUGHTER ] "IT'S OKAY, AND CAN'T DESCRIBE." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS PHOTO WAS EVERYWHERE TODAY. TRUMP AND MITT ROMNEY WERE SPOTTED HAVING DINNER HERE NEW YORK LAST NIGHT, AND EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT ROMNEY'S EXPRESSION. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PHOTO. IS THAT GOOD? [ LAUGHTER ] IT GOT EVEN WORSE WHEN THE SPAGHETTI CAME AND TRUMP SAID, "EVER SEE LADY AND THE TRAMP?" [ LAUGHTER ] "LET'S JUST TRY IT." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT THIS HAS SOME PEOPLE UPSET. I READ THAT DONALD TRUMP'S PICK FOR EDUCATION SECRETARY BETSY DeVOS NEVER WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL, AND HAS NEVER EVEN WORKED FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT AS A A BILLIONAIRE WITHOUT MUCH EXPERIENCE, SHE MIGHT BE TOO SIMILAR TO TRUMP. WELL, WE WANTED TO FIND OUT FOR OURSELVES, SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE HER ON THE LINE RIGHT NOW TO DISCUSS HER NEW ROLE. BETSY, ARE YOU THERE?
HI, JIMMY. IT'S FANTASTIC TO TALK TO YOU, REALLY FANTASTIC. [ LAUGHTER ]

I HAVE BIG RESPECT FOR TRUMP, JIMMY, BIGLY. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WE ARE VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE, VERY DIFFERENT. AND BESIDES, WHO NEEDS EXPERIENCE? THINK ABOUT IT, JIMMY. WHAT TEACHERS DID YOU LIKE MORE IN SCHOOL? THE EXPERIENCED LOSERS, WHO ASSIGNED HOMEWORK EVERY NIGHT, OR THE HUNG OVER SUBSTITUTES WHO JUST TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS AND PUT ON AN OLD VHS COPY OF "E.T."?
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TEACHERS UNIONS HAVE ALSO SPOKEN OUT AGAINST YOU AND YOUR LACK OF --

BUT JIMMY, WHEN AMERICANS ELECTED OUR TREMENDOUS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, AND HE REALLY IS TREMENDOUS, JUST TREMENDOUS. I MEAN, THIS MAN IS SO TREMENDOUSLY TREMENDOUS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST TREMENDOUS OF THE MEN IN THE WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MRS. DeVOS, MRS. DeVOS, I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY SAYING ANYTHING.
NO, I'M SAYING SOMETHING.
Jimmy: WELL, IF I MAY JUST POINT OUT, YOU FAILED AT EVERY POLITICAL MOVEMENT THAT YOU'VE BEEN PART OF.

NOW, I'M A LED ZEPPELIN FAN, BUT I BECAME A -- [ CHEERS ] I BECAME A MAJOR LED ZEPPELIN FAN, WHEN WE WERE DOING "ALMOST FAMOUS." AND -- THE LINE, "I'M A GOLDEN GOD", SUPPOSEDLY, CAME FROM A A TIME THAT CAMERON WAS INTERVIEWING ROBERT PLANT AT A A PARTY.
Jimmy: I AM A GOLDEN GOD. THAT'S MY FAVORITE LINE THAT YOU SAY IN THE FILM.
THAT AS WELL, AND I HEAR IT FROM TIME TO TIME, AS YOU WOULD EXPECT. BUT -- [ CHEERS ] YEAH, BUT SO, I WAS STUNNED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM. AND BEFORE I COULD EVEN THINK WHAT TO DO, HE WAS GONE. AND SO I SPENT THE NEXT HOUR WAITING FOR THE PLANE THINKING ABOUT HOW, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE WOULD HAVE TALKED, AND HE TOO, WOULD HAVE BEEN A THEATER FAN AND --
Jimmy: ROBERT PLANT FROM LED ZEPPELIN?
YEAH, HUGE THEATER FAN. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] I THOUGHT ABOUT THE ALBUMS WE WOULD HAVE COLLABORATED ON, YOU KNOW. AND SO THEN I GOT ON THE PLANE, AND THERE HE WAS, AS I WAS WALKING ON THE PLANE, AND ALL I COULD THINK TO SAY WAS, "THANK YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I SAID -- I CHOKED. I SAID, "THANK YOU." AND HE POLITELY BUT, YOU KNOW, RESERVEDLY WENT -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND UM, YEAH. AND NOW, THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING. TURNS OUT, MY SLIGHT CELEBRITY WAS PAYING OFF THAT DAY BECAUSE I WAS IN FIRST-CLASS, TOO, AND I WAS ONE ROW BEHIND, AND JUST ACROSS THE AISLE FROM HIM. SO I SPENT THE NEXT FIVE HOURS PARALYZED.
Jimmy: STARING AT HIM.
PARALYZED, THINKING, HOW AM I GOING TO BEGIN THIS CONVERSATION?
Jimmy: REALLY, I FEEL SO BAD FOR YOU.
SO ROBERT PLANT CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I AM ALIVE? AND NOTHING CAME TO ME. SO FINALLY WE LANDED AND WE GOT TO THE GATE, AND I REACHED UP TO GET MY CARRY-ON BAG, WHICH, YOU KNOW, TO BE FAIR, WAS NOT IN THE BEST SHAPE, BUT IT WASN'T, LIKE, A SATCHEL OUT OF THE LANDFILL OR SOMETHING.
Jimmy: YEAH, NO. JUST A CARRY-ON BAG.
ITS' A CARRY-ON BAG, AND ROBERT PLANT USED THAT OPPORTUNITY, I GUESS, TO CHASTISE ME AND HE SAID, "DO YOU DO A ROBERT PLANT -- YOU DO A ROBERT PLANT OR A BRITISH?
Jimmy: SURE.
SAY YOUR LINE IS -- [ WHISPERING ] [ IN A BRITISH ACCENT ] I GUESS THAT'S SEEN BETTER DAYS.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE A HIGH VOICE.
TO WHICH -- NO THAT WAS FANTASTIC. TO WHICH I REPLIED, MY NAME'S BILLY CRUDUP I WAS IN "ALMOST FAMOUS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I SAID MY NAME'S BILLY CRUDUP, I WAS IN "ALMOST FAMOUS." I PLAYED THE LEAD GUITARIST, TO WHICH HE REPLIED --
Jimmy: "OH -- IT IS YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] AND THERE'S MORE. THERE'S MORE, AND I SAID, I SAID, "I SAID THE LINE, I AM A A GOLDEN GOD", AND HE SAID,
Jimmy: "THAT'S MY LINE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
TO WHICH I REPLIED -- TO WHICH I REPLIED, "IT'S MY LINE NOW."
Jimmy: HEY! NOT BAD!
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!
Jimmy: OH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, FANTASTIC! HEY, NOT BAD DUDE.
HE'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: DUDE, WE GOT TO GET TALKING ABOUT THESE. YOU HAVE TWO GIANT FILMS COMING OUT.
HUGE.
Jimmy: WE HAD NATALIE PORTMAN YESTERDAY, AND WE HAVE ANNETTE BENING COMING ON IN A FEW WEEKS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: SO THE FIRST FILM WE TALK ABOUT IS "JACKIE."
"JACKIE", WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTELY SUBLIME FILM. IT'S AN AMAZING STORY ABOUT --
Jimmy: SHE IS FANTASTIC.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU PLAY THE JOURNALIST FROM "LIFE" MAGAZINE?
WELL, I PLAY A VERSION OF IT. SO, THE ACTUAL STORY WAS THAT SHE WANTED TO HAVE A -- A A FRIENDLY JOURNALIST FROM "LIFE" MAGAZINE, WHO -- SO SHE COULD KIND OF TALK ABOUT WHAT HIS PRESIDENCY WAS REALLY LIKE, AND HE -- PABLO, WANTED TO USE THAT, AS THE KIND OF FRAMEWORK FOR THE MOVIE. BUT I LEARNED ABOUT IT, AFTER THEY HAD SHOT ALMOST ALL OF THE MOVIE, AND THEN HE DISCOVERED THAT HE WANTED THIS FRAMEWORK. SO THEY CALLED ME -- WITHIN THE TIME THAT THEY CALLED ME, AND I HAD SHOT THE MOVIE, IT WAS LIKE A WEEK AND A HALF.
Jimmy: WOW.
SO TO BE IN THAT MUCH OF THE MOVIE WAS A GREAT SURPRISE, BECAUSE THE MOVIE IS -- PHENOMENAL, AND NATALIE IS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY.
Jimmy: AND SHOWS HOW GOOD YOU ARE AS AN ACTOR, TO JUST COME ON IN THERE, AND HIT A A HOME RUN. UNBELIEVABLE.
THAT'S RIGHT, JIMMY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOWS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT DOES! YOU WERE FANTASTIC IN IT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND ALSO --
"20TH CENTURY", MIKE MILLS MADE THIS MOVIE, "20TH CENTURY WOMEN", WHICH IS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL FILM.
Jimmy: NOT THE GUITARIST FROM R.E.M.?
THAT'S -- CORRECT. IN FACT ON MY PHONE, IT'S LISTED AS MIKE MILLS TOO, BECAUSE MIKE MILLS IS A A MUSICIAN I'VE MET. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, DOES HE --
FROM R.E.M.
Jimmy: FROM R.E.M., DID HE RECOGNIZE YOU? WHEN YOU MET MIKE MILLS?
HE DOESN'T KNOW I HAVE HIS NUMBER, TECHNICALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] SO MIKE MILLS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY FILMMAKER, AND THIS IS A PERSONAL STORY ABOUT HIS MOM. AND ANNETTE BENING IS SPECTACULAR, AND I HAVE A A MUSTACHE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A GREAT MUSTACHE.
IN THE FILM "20TH CENTURY WOMEN", I PLAY THE MAN.
Jimmy: YOU ARE LIKE -- YOU ARE A MANLY MAN.
HEY, GO ON.
Jimmy: YOU ARE.
JIMMY --
Jimmy: AND YOU HAVE A A MUSTACHE.
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT SUPPORTER. I APPRECIATE THAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YEAH, AND YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
