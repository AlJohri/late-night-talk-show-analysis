[ CHEERS ] THIS IS THE SHOW TO BE AT. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. LET'S GET TO THE NEWS, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IT'S STILL THE ROUGH WEATHER WE'RE HAVING. THE NORTHEAST IS EXPERIENCING ONE OF THE WORST WINTERS IN HISTORY. WHICH MEANS THAT SCHOOLS HAVE HAD A RECORD NUMBER OF SNOW DAYS. [ CHEERS ] AT THIS RATE THE ONLY MATH KIDS ARE DOING IS HOW MANY GLASSES OF WINE THEIR MOM DRINKS BEFORE 2:00PM -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S THE SAME GLASS! [ LAUGHTER ] STOP COUNTING. [ LAUGHTER ] SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE'S BEEN AFFECTED BY THE SNOW. IN FACT SCHOOLS AND FEDERAL OFFICES IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WERE SHUT DOWN TODAY AFTER THE CITY RECEIVED FOUR INCHES OF SNOW IN THEIR FIRST MAJOR SNOWSTORM OF THE SEASON. [ LAUGHTER ] OR AS BOSTON RESIDENTS PUT IT, "ARE YOU [ BLEEP ] KIDDING ME?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ BOSTON ACCENT ] FOUR INCHES OF SNOW? I LEFT FOR WORK THIS MORNING OUT OF A SECOND STORY WINDOW. COWBOY UP! [ LAUGHTER ] FOUR INCHES OF SNOW. CLOSING SCHOOLS -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOR FOUR INCHES OF SNOW. THIS, POLITICAL NEWS HERE GUYS. YESTERDAY A FEDERAL JUDGE SUSPENDED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON IMMIGRATION. WHICH MEANS MILLIONS OF UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE COULD BE DEMORTGAGED AGAIN. WHEN ASKED IF HE'S MAD ABOUT BEING OVERRULED, OBAMA SAID, "YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 23 YEARS, RIGHT?" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO -- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. [ APPLAUSE ] PRESIDENT OBAMA SPENT MONDAY PLAYING A ROUND OF GOLF IN SUNNY CALIFORNIA, AND THEN FLEW BACK TO WASHINGTON ON AIR FORCE ONE. AND 10,000 PEOPLE STRANDED AT BOSTON LOGAN JUST BECAME REPUBLICANS. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY -- VERY INTERESTING HOW THAT HAPPENS. DURING A RECENT INTERVIEW FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA HAS REVEALED SHE HAS BANNED BOXED MACARONI AND CHEESE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] THOUGH IT'S BEEN TOUGH ON BIDEN, 'CAUSE HE COULDN'T MAKE HIS WIFE ANY JEWELRY FOR VALENTINE'S DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE, "GIVE ME A HEAD'S UP! GIVE ME A HEAD'S UP, WHAT AM I GONNA DO?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT, TURKEY HAND. TURKEY HAND IT IS. HERE WE GO. [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF JOE BIDEN, I READ THAT SOME DEMOCRATS ARE DEBATING IF HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD PICK JOE BIDEN TO BE HER VICE PRESIDENT IF HE DECIDES NOT TO RUN IN 2016. ON ONE HAND HE'S AN EXPERIENCED POLITICIAN WHO HAS SPENT YEARS SHAPING FOREIGN POLICY. ON THE OTHER HAND --
AND NEIL AN OLD BUTT BUDDY. ARE YOU HERE NEIL? [ LAUGHTER ]

[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ RIMSHOT ] DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS, LAST WEEK, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S OUTGOING SENIOR ADVISER JOHN PODESTA MADE NEWS WHEN HE SAID HIS BIGGEST FAILURE FROM 2014 WAS NOT DISCLOSING GOVERNMENT UFO FILES. YEAH. HE SAID, "THE TRUTH IS STILL OUT THERE." [ LAUGHTER ] IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR SEVERAL PROSPECTIVE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TO JUMP ON THE ISSUE. HERE'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID "IT'S TIME FOR OBAMA TO DISCLOSE THESE UFO FILES." RAND PAUL SAID, "WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT HIDING?" [ LAUGHTER ] RICK SCOTT SAID, "WE SHOULD PROBABLY JUST FORGET ABOUT IT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JEB BUSH SAID, "ARE THERE ALIENS AMONG US?" RICK SCOTT SAID, "SERIOUSLY, LET'S JUST MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE. WHAT'S UP WITH IMMIGRATION, HUH?" [ LAUGHTER ] MARCO RUBIO SAID, "DID ANYONE NOTICE RICK SCOTT IS SWEATING GREEN FLUID?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY ILLINIOS CONGRESSMAN DAN LIPINSKI SAID, "YOU IDIOT, THEY'RE ON TO US! GET BACK TO THE MOTHERSHIP! GLEEP GLORP -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS PRETTY INTERESTING. I HEARD THAT GEORGE WASHINGTON MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO USE MEDICAL MARIJUANA, TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN FROM HIS TEETH, WHICH WERE MADE OF IVORY, BRASS AND GOLD. WHICH ALSO MEANS HE WAS THE FIRST LIL' WAYNE. [ LAUGHTER ] BOTH MEN HAD GRILLS. I THINK YOU CAN TELL WASHINGTON SMOKED WEED. I MEAN TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FAMOUS IMAGE OF GEORGE WASHINGTON CROSSING THE DELAWARE, YOU KNOW THAT? RIGHT? CAN YOU PULL UP SO WE CAN SEE THE REST OF THE PAINTING? THAT'S A CLUE RIGHT THERE.

I WAS -- WE WERE ALSO ON, ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND I'VE NEVER HAD A MORE VISCERAL SENSE OF NOBODY LISTENING TO WHAT I WAS SAYING. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE? IS ANYONE WATCHING THIS? I'M GUESSING NOT.
Jimmy: YOU GIVE OUT YOUR PERSONAL PHONE NUMBER, YEAH. AND NO ONE --
I KNOW. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY LET ALL -- THAT'S COMEDIC ROYALTY. AND THE ROYAL FAMILY IN ENGLAND CANNOT BE ON A PLANE TOGETHER. IT SEEMS RISKY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BECAUSE IF ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED ON SUNDAY NIGHT, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO COMEDY IN AMERICA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT.
IT WOULD BE ALL GONE.
Jimmy: DID YOU -- YOU GREW UP IN ENGLAND, RIGHT?
I DID. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A ROCK SOLID GUESS.
THANK YOU, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT IS --
Jimmy: I DID MY RESEARCH ON -- YEAH. WIKIPEDIA, YEAH AND THEY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S RIGHT. YOUR EARS CONNECTED TO YOUR BRAIN, THEY MADE THE ONE CONNECTION -- I THINK I'LL GO -- I DON'T WANT COMBO THIS TO MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK I CAN CRACK THIS CASE.
Jimmy: WELL, I WASN'T SURE IF YOU WERE BORN THERE OR JUST RAISED THERE.
I WAS BORN AND RAISED. BORN AND RAISED THERE.
Jimmy: BORN AND RASIED. AND AMERICAN COMEDY WAS THERE AT THE TIME?
YEAH, THAT'S ALL I USED TO LISTEN TO AMERICAN STANDUP BEFORE BED. I USE TO HAVE ALL OF RICHARD PRYOR ALBUMS. I HAD EVERY SINGLE ALBUM BY RICHARD PRYOR, AND I WOULD LISTEN TO IT EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I WENT TO BED. TO THE POINT -- I PRETTY MUCH KNEW EVERY SINGLE ALBUM OF HIS BY HEART. AND HAVE YOU NOT HEARD RICHARD PRYOR'S COMEDY, UNTIL YOU'VE HEARD IT SECONDHAND THROUGH THE VOICE OF A A 9-YEAR-OLD WHITE BRITISH BOY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO SOUND.
THAT'S REALLY HOW IT -- YEAH.
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS LISTEN TO A LITTLE WHITE BRITISH BOY SAYING, "NOT MANY BLACK PEOPLE GET BIT BY SNAKES. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE THEY BE STROLLING TO SMOOTH IN THE WOODS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY BE LIKE SNAKE." YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: THAT I AIN'T BAD -- RICHARD PRYOR, YEAH YOU KNOW THAT.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS AMAZING, EVEN IN ENGLAND. I THOUGHT, "WHY DO BLACK PEOPLE NOT GET BITTEN BY SNAKES?" I DON'T KNOW, BUT I LOVE THE WAY HE EXPLAINS IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY IT'S FANTASTIC. I GOT TO TELL YOU, WE KNOW WE'RE FANS OF YOUR SHOW, I'VE MADE APPEARANCES ON YOUR SHOW AS WELL.
YOU HAVE. YOU TOOK A FISH TO THE FACE AND THANK YOU FOR THAT.
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YEAH. IF YOU GET THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YEAH, I DID. I TOOK A FISH TO THE FACE. IT'S JUST SO GOOD, AND IT'S JUST SO WELL WRITTEN.
YEAH. SO, WE LOOKED AT THE MISS AMERICA -- YEAH MISS AMERICA CLAIMS TO BE A GREAT ORGANIZATION IN GENERAL, WHICH IS ARGUABLE. BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, IT'S TRUE, THEY ARE. I GUESS.
I WOULDN'T -- I'M MORE SURE THEY'RE NOT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY VERY GOOD.
BUT THEY CLAIM TO BE THE LARGEST SCHOLARSHIP FUND FOR WOMEN, AND SO WE LOOKED INTO THAT, AND THAT TURNS TO BE -- THAT TURNS OUT TO BE A A STRETCHING OF THE TRUTH.
Jimmy: IT IS, REALLY. YEAH.
IT'S HEAVILY STRETCHED.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A SCREEN GRAB FROM --
WELL THAT'S WHERE THIS IS FROM THEIR WEBSITE. AS WE STARTED LOOKING INTO THIS, THIS IS WHEN WE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING UP. [ LAUGHTER ] THEIR WEBSITE --
Jimmy: YOU DID NOT MESS WITH THIS?
NO, NO, THIS WAS THEIR WEBSITE.
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND IT JUST SAYS "WE FUN SCHOLARS." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO CLOSE.
SO CLOSE.
Jimmy: SO CLOSE.
SO VERY CLOSE.
Jimmy: SO CLOSE, ALMOST --
THAT KIND OF ISSUED A BAT SIGNAL IN OUR MIND OF, "OH, THIS LOOKS LIKE A [ BLEEP ] ORGANIZATION." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IF YOU CAN SPELL THE WORD FUND, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT FUNDING ANYTHING.
