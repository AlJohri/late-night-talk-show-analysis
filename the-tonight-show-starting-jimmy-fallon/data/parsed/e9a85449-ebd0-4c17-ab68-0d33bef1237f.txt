THIS IS IT, EVERYBODY. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S GONNA BE FUN. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, TONIGHT HILLARY CLINTON GAVE HER BIG SPEECH AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, OFFICIALLY ACCEPTING THE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT. [ CHEERS ] YES. THE SPEECH WENT WELL BUT THE LIGHTNING SHOOTING FROM HER HANDS WAS A BIT MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] AND DID YOU SEE THIS? DURING HIS BIG SPEECH, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES HILLARY CLINTON GETS KNOCKED DOWN, SHE ALWAYS GETS BACK UP. AT WHICH POINT HE WAS ACCUSED OF PLAGIARIZING HIS SPEECH FROM CHUMBAWAMBA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT'S NOT --
Jimmy: UH -- "SHE DRINKS A WHISKEY DRINK, SHE DRINKS A VODKA DRINK, SHE DRINKS A LAGER DRINK, SHE DRINKS A CIDER DRINK, DANNY BOY." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] JOE BIDEN ALSO SPOKE AT THE CONVENTION. HE HAD SOME PRETTY STRONG WORDS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. AND AT ONE POINT THE CROWD ACTUALLY STARTED CHANTING THE LINES FROM ONE OF HIS SPEECH. TAKE A LOOK.
HE HAS NO CLUE ABOUT WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT. ACTUALLY, HE HAS NO CLUE PERIOD.
NO CLUE, NO CLUE, NO CLUE.
YOU'VE GOT IT. LET ME --
NO CLUE, NO CLUE.
Jimmy: HE WAS LIKE, WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT TRUMP, RIGHT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M NOT DONE WITH MY SPEECH. ONE OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS AT THE CONVENTION WAS HILLARY'S RUNNING MATE TIM KAINE, AND A A LOT OF PEOPLE ONLINE WERE SAYING HE WAS A PRETTY ATTRACTIVE GUY WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER. CHECK OUT WHAT I MEAN. HERE'S TIM KAINE NOW, AND HERE HE IS WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER.
Steve: OOH.
Jimmy: HE'S A PRETTY HANDSOME DUDE RIGHT THERE. YEAH. HE'S NOT THE ONLY POLITICIAN WHO LOOKS PRETTY DIFFERENT WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER. HERE'S JOE BIDEN NOW. AND HERE'S JOE BIDEN WHEN HE WAS YOUNG. [ CHEERS ] AN ALL-AMERICAN BOY THERE, YEAH. HERE'S HILLARY NOW. HILLARY WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER. BRIGHT YOUNG LADY. AND FINALLY, CHECK OUT DONALD TRUMP NOW AND HERE HE IS WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU CAN SEE IT. SUBTLE. SUBTLE DIFFERENCE.
Steve: IS THAT HIM? THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE -- THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE CHUCKY.

HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN EVEN SENT AN E-MAIL YESTERDAY ASKING SUPPORTERS IF THEY HAVE SPARE ROOM OR A COUCH TO HOUSE VOLUNTEERS AND STAFF FOR THE CAMPAIGN. HILLARY SUPPORTERS ARE LIKE, "WHY ARE YOU STILL SENDING E-MAILS? WHY ARE -- DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE. DON'T SEND -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ANYTHING BUT SEND AN E-MAIL. STOP, PLEASE." I THOUGHT THIS WAS PRETTY COOL. SCIENTISTS FROM INDIANA DISCOVERED THAT AN 8-YEAR-OLD ORANGUTAN NAMED ROCKY CAN MIMIC HUMAN VOICES AND COPY WORDS IN A CONVERSATIONAL WAY. BUT IT GOT AWKWARD WHEN THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS "ACTUALLY, MY NAME'S RICKY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GUYS KEEP CALLING ME ROCKY."

Jimmy: RIGHT.
SO IT FEELS LIKE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, IT FEELS TO ME LIKE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IN MARRIAGE COUNSELING, ONCE EVERYTHING GETS OUT ON THE TABLE, ONCE THE TRUTH GETS OUT, ONCE EVERYBODY SAYS EVERYTHING THEY'VE BEEN HARBORING, YOU GET -- THERE'S A A REALLY DARK TIME WHEN YOU JUST LOOKING AT YOUR PARTNER LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK?" [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW? BUT THERE'S A DARK BEFORE THE DAWN. LIKE WHEN EVERYTHING GETS OUT, IT'S A GOOD THING. IT JUST DOESN'T -- IT SUCKS BAD WHEN THE TRUTH IS OUT. BUT I THINK EVERYBODY CAN SEE IT NOW, AND I JUST THINK IT'S JUST A LITTLE DARKNESS BEFORE THE CLEANSING THAT WE'LL HAVE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH.
Jimmy: I LIKE THAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WE'RE GONNA DO THAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I WANNA TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE WHEN WE COME GET BACK.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. NO, BUT YOU'RE FANTASTIC IN IT. AND ONLY YOU COULD PULL THIS OFF. I SAW IT LAST NIGHT IN IMAX 3-D WITH OUR STAFF. WE WENT AND SAW IT AND THE APPLAUSE AT THE END. IT'S SO GOOD. I'M WATCHING THIS THING AND I GO, WHO IS THE DIRECTOR?
DAVID AYER.
Jimmy: DAVID -- I WOULD BE SO THANKFUL FOR YOU IF I WAS THE DIRECTOR. BECAUSE ONLY WILL SMITH KNOWS HOW TO JUST STAND UP AND WALK ON CARS AND STUFF. SHOOTING THINGS.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: IF THAT WAS ME, SO YOU WANT ME TO AIM WHERE? [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU WANT ME TO SHOOT THERE? I MEAN, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY A PRO AND YOU DO IT SO COOL AND YOU LOOK AWESOME. IT'S JUST VISUALLY STUNNING.
IT WAS GREAT. I WAS COOL, YOU KNOW. THE SUICIDE SQUAD IS IN THE BATMAN WORLD, IN THE DC COMICS WORLD.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, IT WAS COOL. I MADE A LOT OF MOVIES. IT'S ALL GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S ANOTHER MOVIE. IT'S ANOTHER MOVIE, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THE BATMOBILE CAME AROUND THE CORNER.
Jimmy: YEAH.

Jimmy: YEAH. JUST LIKE THAT.
YO, THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.
Jimmy: THIS IS REAL, THIS IS REAL.
BEN AFFLECK JUMPS OUT OF THE BATMOBILE.

Jimmy: THAT'S ALL GOOD.
I WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOD.
Jimmy: YEAH, THIS IS IT. I'M EXCITED. YEAH, IT'S GOOD.
I WAS SIX YEARS OLD. I WAS IN THE SCENE LIKE, BEN, CAN YOU SIGN THIS? CAN YOU SIGN THIS FOR ME? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NO, IT WAS BAD.
Jimmy: BUT THE IDEA THAT -- I DON'T KNOW THE DC -- I DON'T KNOW THE COMIC ITSELF, BUT IT'S LIKE BASICALLY SIX LUNATICS GET TOGETHER. THEY'RE EVIL. THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE FIGHTING EVIL.
YEAH, DAVID AYER HE SAID THIS IS NOT A MOVIE OF GOOD VERSUS EVIL, IT'S A MOVIE OF BAD VERSUS EVIL.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: THEY'RE ALL MESSED UP PEOPLE.
MESSED UP PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW, THE INTERESTING QUESTION AT THE CORE OF IT, YOU KNOW, IS THERE A POINT WHEN YOU DO SO MUCH BAD STUFF THAT YOU'RE UNREDEEMABLE? YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION FOR THESE GUYS WHO HAVE THEIR LAST OPPORTUNITY AT HUMANITY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND IT'S REALLY COOL. AND THEN THIS BIG GIANT WORLD. AND IT'S -- YOU KNOW, VERY RARELY DO YOU GET TO HAVE THAT SIZE OF WORLD BUT ALSO GET TO ACT, YOU KNOW.

Jimmy: BUT YOU HAVE FANTASTIC KIDS BECAUSE I'VE HAD WILLOW ON, JADEN, AND I JUST TOLD HER, THEY'RE SO POLITE AND NICE.
OH, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND A HEAD ON THEIR SHOULDERS. I WAS TALKING TO YOU BACKSTAGE ABOUT IT, HOW DO YOU RAISE THEM, WHAT'S THE SECRET?
WE STARTED WITH A THING THAT WAS INTERESTING, LIKE WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG, WE DID A THING CALLED THE CIRCLE OF SAFETY. RIGHT? SO WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF SAFETY THE KIDS ARE ALLOWED TO SAY ANYTHING THAT THEY WANT, THEY CAN TELL US ANYTHING THEY DID AND THEY CAN CLEANSE IT ALL OUT AND THEY DON'T GET IN TROUBLE, RIGHT.
Jimmy: SO YOU STAND IN A A CIRCLE?
SO WE STAND IN A CIRCLE AND WE CALL IT CIRCLE OF SAFETY AND EVERYBODY GETS TO SAY A CURSE WORD SO WE KNOW WE'RE IN THE CIRCLE OF SAFETY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN WE SAY, ALL RIGHT, NOW ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY DID, GET IT OUT NOW, ALL RIGHT? BECAUSE THERE'S A RULE IS IF WE FIND OUT AFTER THE CIRCLE OF SAFETY THAT IT WAS SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T SAY, THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
RIGHT?
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT IN THE CIRCLE.
YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT IN THE CIRCLE OF SAFETY. BUT NOW THEY GOT USED TO TELLING US EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AS A FATHER, YOU DO NOT WANT A CIRCLE OF SAFETY WITH A A 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO.
YOU DO NOT!
Jimmy: NO.
YOU DO NOT. I'M LIKE, "BABY, YOU NEED TO START LYING." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LIKE, I'M OUT OF THE CIRCLE.
I'M LIKE, OH, NOPE. DADDY'S OUT OF THE CIRCLE. HERE WE GO. NOPE, NOPE. YOU AND YOUR MOM.
Jimmy: CLIMBING OUT OF THE CIRCLE.
