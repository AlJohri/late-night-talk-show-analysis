SCARLETT JOHANSSON SAT HERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. SHE DID. SHE ABSOLUTELY DID.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I HADN'T BEEN TO THE OSCARS IN 20 YEARS. WAIT -- I HAVE TO PUT MY HANDS UNDER MY THIGHS.
Jimmy: WHY?
BECAUSE MY WIFE SAYS I GESTICULATE TOO MUCH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO THIS WITH MY HANDS UNDER MY THIGHS.
Jimmy: WELL, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO OPERATE THIS iPAD, OR WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WE'RE GOOD.
Jimmy: OKAY. DO YOU -- I MET YOU -- ONCE YEARS AGO. YOU PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER THIS AT ALL. YOU WERE WITH GEORGE LUCAS, AND YOU WERE EATING BREAKFAST AT THE BEL-AIR HOTEL IN THE OUTDOOR KIND OF AREA -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS WALKING BY, AND YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS RESTAURANT TO GO TO THE -- THE FRONT DESK. I WAS WALKING BY AND I SAW YOU GUYS. AND I THINK I SAW -- I KNEW GEORGE LUCAS MAYBE, A LITTLE BIT. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU. I'M A GIANT FAN OF YOURS. AND SO GEORGE GOES, "HEY JIMMY. COME SIT DOWN -- YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME COFFEE OR SOMETHING?" I GO "UH, SURE," AND YOU GUYS WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION. YOU WERE REALLY MAD, BECAUSE THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU HAD TO DO LIKE A TRIBUTE TO GEORGE LUCAS AT THE A.F.I.
WITH CARRIE.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND CARRIE FISHER.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND YOU WERE SO BUMMED, YOU HAD TO FOLLOW CARRIE FISHER, BECAUSE SHE'S THE FUNNIEST HUMAN BEING ON EARTH. YOU WERE GOING, "I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAD TO FOLLOW CARRIE FREAKING FISHER -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OF ALL PEOPLE, CARRIE FREAKING FISHER, THE FUNNIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD, AND I HAVE TO FOLLOW HER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
CARRIE FISHER ACTUALLY WALKED OUT AND SAID, "THANK YOU, GEORGE, FOR PUTTING MY HEAD ON THE -- ON THE TOP OF A PEZ DISPENSER." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WENT CRAZY. I CRACKED UP, AND THEN I HAD TO GO AND FOLLOW HER.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU WERE GREAT THOUGH, AND GEORGE WAS --
THAT WAS IN THE DAYS WHEN I WAS GESTICULATING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I THINK YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO GESTICULATING. I THINK ITS FUN.
WELL, I -- YEAH. I DO. BUT EXCEPT MY WIFE -- [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: THEY WANT -- THEY WANT TO SEE -- THEY WANT TO SEE THIS, RICHARD DREYFUSS.
IT'LL HAPPEN.
Jimmy: NOBODY WANTS THIS.
I SWEAR TO GOD, IT'LL HAPPEN, BECAUSE IT'LL JUST HAPPEN, BECAUSE OF WHAT.
Jimmy: BUT NO, WE WANT TO SEE --
YOU'VE MENTIONED SCARLETT JOHANSSON, AND I'LL START GESTICULATING.
Jimmy: DO YOU GET -- DO YOU GET TIRED OF PEOPLE ASKING YOU QUESTIONS ABOUT "JAWS"? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
THERE ARE MORE STORIES ABOUT "JAWS" THAN ANY FILM EVER MADE, AND THEY'RE GREAT STORIES AND, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU HEAR THE SAME QUESTIONS ALL THE TIME. I HAVE NOW MADE A DECISION. I -- I DO THIS ALL THE TIME. IF YOU ASK ME A QUESTION THAT I HAVE NOT HEARD, I'LL GIVE YOU $10. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND IF YOU ASK ME A QUESTION I HAVE HEARD, YOU GIVE ME $10. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THINK ABOUT IT.

Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. MY "JAWS" QUESTION. READY? FOR RICHARD DREYFUSS, $10 ON THE LINE. WOULD YOU RATHER FIGHT ONE JAWS-SIZED DUCK OR 100 DUCK-SIZED JAWS? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S NOT A "JAWS" QUESTION. "JAWS" QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT THE FILM "JAWS," THE MAKING OF IT, OR LIKE THAT. IT'S NOT JUST A JOKE SAYING ABOUT THE WORD. [ LAUGHTER ] SO --
Jimmy: DO I HAVE TO GIVE YOU MONEY FOR THIS?
