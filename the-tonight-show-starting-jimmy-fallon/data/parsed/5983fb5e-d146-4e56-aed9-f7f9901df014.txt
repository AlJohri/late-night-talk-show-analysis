[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] VERY EXCITING DAY, EVERYONE'S WONDERING WHO'S GOING TO GET THE FIRST HIT, WHO'S GONNA HIT THE FIRST HOME RUN, WHO'S GOING TO TAKE THE FIRST URINE TEST, SO MUCH STUFF TO BE EXCITED ABOUT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE METS ACTUALLY GOT NEW YORK MAYOR BILL DeBLASIO TO THROW OUT THE FIRST PITCH AT THEIR HOME OPENER TODAY. AND ALTHOUGH THE PITCH WENT JUST FINE, MOST OF THE TIME THESE PITCHES ARE PRETTY WILD. SO HERE'S A COLLECTION OF THE WORST FIRST PITCHES OF ALL TIMES. ♪ YOU'RE SIMPLY THE BEST BETTER THAN ALL THE REST BETTER THAN ANYONE ANYONE I EVER MET ♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT WAS THE BEST ONE.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: HE PUT LIKE AN OVERSPIN ON IT. IT WAS GREAT.
Steve: LIKE BOWLING.
Jimmy: YEAH. OF COURSE THE BIG SPORTS STORY RIGHT NOW IS MARCH MADNESS. THE FINAL FOUR WAS SET LAST NIGHT WITH CONNECTICUT TAKING ON FLORIDA AND WISCONSIN TAKING ON KENTUCKY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. MEANWHILE, DUKE WILL BE TAKING ON A PINT OF BEN & JERRY'S. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, CONNECTICUT BEAT MICHIGAN STATE, THE TEAM THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD PICKED TO WIN THE WHOLE TOURNAMENT. OBAMA PICKED THEM TO WIN. COMPLETELY BUSTED HIS BRACKET. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY TODAY CONNECTICUT GOT A FRUIT BASKET FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN. [ LAUGHTER ] "YOU'RE WELCOME TO CRIMEA ANY TIME." [ LAUGHTER ] AND GET THIS, AFTER CONNECTICUT BEAT MICHIGAN STATE, THEY ACTUALLY TWEETED AT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND APOLOGIZED FOR BUSTING HIS BRACKET. HERE'S THE TWEET, THIS IS REAL. IT SAYS, "SORRY ABOUT BUSTING YOUR BRACKET @BARACKOBAMA. WE HAVE ROOM ON OUR BANDWAGON IF YOU'RE INTERESTED." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT SURE OBAMA WAS PREPARED FOR UCONN TO WIN, BECAUSE HE TWEETED BACK, "NO, I'M NOT INTERESTED. ALSO, APOLOGY NOT ACCEPTED. #UCONN #YOUSUCK." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WEIRD. 'CAUSE THEN UCONN TWEETED BACK AT OBAMA. THEY SAID, "COME ON, MR. PRESIDENT, WE'RE JUST MAKING A LIGHTHEARTED JOKE." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN OBAMA TWEETED, "YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S JUST BEEN A REALLY STRESSFUL TIME FOR ME. THIS WHOLE RUSSIAN-UKRAINE THING IS TOTALLY CRAY-CRAY, AND WITH THE OBAMACARE DEADLINE I'M ALL, WHAT? I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST HARD RIGHT NOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN UCONN TWEETED, "WAIT A A SECOND THAT WAS WAY LONGER THAN 140 CHARACTERS, HOW DID YOU EVEN TWEET THAT?" [ LAUGHTER ] TO WHICH OBAMA REPLIED, "I'M THE PRESIDENT, BITCH. I HOPE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA KICKS YOUR BUTT. #UOFF #FU." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SEEMS A LITTLE --HE'S STRESSED OUT. HE'S STRESSED OUT. BUT, SOME GOOD NEWS FOR THE PRESIDENT. I SAW THAT THIS WEEKEND WAS THE FOUR-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RACE TO THE TOP PROGRAM TO HELP SCHOOLS BOOST THEIR PERFORMANCE. THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE'S PLEASED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE STUDENTS WERE LIKE, "IT GONE GOOD." [ LAUGHTER ] MORE POLITICAL NEWS. DURING A RECENT TRIP TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, JOE BIDEN REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS PLANS FOR 2016. HE SAID, "2016, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT CAMP I WANT TO GO TO THIS SUMMER." [ LAUGHTER ] REALLY BIG OVER THE WEEKEND, THOUGH. I SAW THIS. POPE FRANCIS MADE NEWS WHEN HE ACTUALLY WENT TO CONFESSION HIMSELF. THE POPE GOING TO CONFESSION. WHEN HE ASKED WHO HE CONFESSED HIS SINS TO, HE SAID, "DUH, OPRAH." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE. WHY WOULD I EVEN GUESS? I THOUGHT THIS WAS GREAT. ELTON JOHN AND HIS PARTNER DAVID FURNISH ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL GET MARRIED IN MAY NOW THAT GAY MARRIAGE IS LEGAL IN ENGLAND. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ALL THINKING, "ELTON JOHN IS GAY?" [ LAUGHTER ] BIG TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: NO!
Jimmy: OH YEAH. EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT -- OH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO. EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THAT BIG CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED BY THE U.N. TODAY. IT'S REALLY HITTING HOME FOR A A LOT OF PEOPLE. IN FACT, I JUST SAW THAT CALIFORNIA IS HAVING TO DRIVE 30 MILLION SALMON TO THE OCEAN, BECAUSE THIS YEAR'S DROUGHT HAS DRIED UP THE RIVERS THAT NORMALLY GET THEM THERE. YEAH, IT'S TRICKY. TO MAKE THE SALMON COMFORTABLE, THE TRUCKERS HAD TO DRIVE AGAINST TRAFFIC. AND IT WAS JUST -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT WAS FROM MY SCIENCE TEACHER. YEAH, THANKS.
Steve: SCIENCE.
Jimmy: YEAH. THIS IS INTERESTING, TODAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNVEILED NEW SAFETY GUIDELINES THAT WILL REQUIRE ALL NEW CARS TO HAVE THOSE REARVIEW CAMERAS BY 2018. YEAH, REARVIEW CAMERAS. OR AS THAT WAS CALLED IN OUR STATION WAGON GROWING UP, JIMMY. [ LAUGHTER ] "STICK YOUR HEAD OUT AND SEE IF I'M GONNA HIT ANYTHING, WILL YOU?" [ APPLAUSE ] "YOU'RE CLOSE TO --" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, THIS IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD THING, BUT A NEW SURVEY FOUND THAT 30% OF AMERICANS ADMIT TO GETTING MOST OF THEIR NEWS FROM FACEBOOK. OF COURSE WHEN FACEBOOK HEARD ABOUT THIS, THEY ACTUALLY DECIDED TO EXPERIMENT WITH PRINTING A NEWSPAPER. WE GOT A COPY OF IT HERE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE HEADLINES HERE. THE TOP STORY, "'SUPER EXCITED FOR THE WEEKEND,' CLAIMS WOMAN YOU DON'T REMEMBER FROM HIGH SCHOOL." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE BIG STORY. HERE'S ANOTHER HEADLINE. "EVERYBODY IN EXISTENCE MAYBE ATTENDING PARTY." [ LAUGHTER ] NOBODY EVER CLICKS YES. AND THE LAST HEADLINE, "MEDIOCRE SUNRISE CAPTURED ON FILM." THERE YOU GO. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT, GUYS.

SURE. WELL, IT'S -- I DON'T WANT TO GIVE TOO MUCH AWAY. THAT'S -- IT'S A TRICKY MARVEL IS VERY HUSH-HUSH LOCK AND KEY. IT'S MORE ABOUT -- INSTEAD OF CAPTAIN AMERICA ADJUSTING TO, YOU KNOW, TECHNOLOGY. HE'S NOT AMAZED AT THE INTERNET AND CELL PHONES ANY MORE. IT'S MORE ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE COMPANY THAT HE WORKS FOR. IT'S MORE ABOUT UNDERSTANDING, YOU KNOW, IN ORDER TO -- IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE SAFETY THAT WE ENSURE, YOU KNOW, YOU MAY HAVE TO BEND THE RULES. GIVEN MODERN TECHNOLOGY, IT'S A A GRAY AREA IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG. AND I THINK GIVEN THE FACT THAT STEVE ROGERS IS FROM THE '40s, IT'S A QUESTION OF MORALITY THAT BUMPS FOR HIM A LITTLE BIT.

THERE WAS A MORNING WE WERE COMING OUT FROM SCHOOL, AND I SAW AT THE END OF OUR STAIRS THERE WAS A FLAP OF WALLPAPER JUST KIND OF POKING OUT FROM THE EDGE OF THE STAIRS. AND I SAW IT, THIS IS BAD -- AND I SAW IT, AND I JUST STARTED RIPPING IT AND THE WHOLE THING, IT KEPT GOING. AND I RIPPED A HUGE -- A HUGE CHUNK OF WALLPAPER OFF THE WALL. AND WE WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE FOR SCHOOL AND MY MOTHER SAW IT. AND MY MOTHER WAS FURIOUS, HER FACE MELTED. AND SHE WAS FURIOUS, AND WOULDN'T LET US LEAVE UNTIL SOMEONE OWNED UP TO IT. SCOTT WAS WAY TOO YOUNG, SMALL TO HAVE REACHED THE CRIME SCENE.
Jimmy: SO, IT'S CLEARLY YOU.

Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
I MEAN, BECAUSE SHE'S SCARY, AND HE WAS A SWEETHEART, AND HE JUST COULDN'T HELP IT AND HE FINALLY OWNED UP TO IT.
Jimmy: CHRIS, WHAT MOVIE DID YOU WANT TO SEE THE MOST AS A A KID.
WHAT MOVIE DID I WANT TO SEE THE MOST AS A KID?
Jimmy: MOM, YOU KNOW THIS STORY?
OH, GOD. YEAH.
MOM MIGHT KNOW THIS. AS I SAID, MY MOTHER WAS -- MY MOTHER RULED WITH AN IRON FIST.
GENERAL.
IF YOU WERE DRIVING SOMEWHERE AND YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ROUGH HOUSING. AND SHE SAID I'LL TURN THIS CAR AROUND. SHE'S TURNING THAT CAR AROUND. THERE WAS A COUPLE TIMES, "ACE VENTURA." I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD EVERYONE WAS.
YEP.
WHEN THE FIRST "ACE VENTURA" CAME OUT --
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT ON THE WAY TO THE MOVIE THEATER, I WAS, YOU KNOW, ROUGH HOUSING. ROUGH HOUSING. WHAT IS ROUGH HOUSING? WHATEVER IT WAS, I WAS DOING IT.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD.
AND IT GOT TO A POINT THAT MY MOTHER TURNED THE CAR AROUND, AND I ENDED UP NOT SEEING "ACE VENTURA." THIS HAPPENED THREE TIMES.
YES.
THREE TIMES.
NO IDLE THREATS. NO IDLE THREATS.
WE TURNED AROUND, AND THEN THE NEXT WEEKEND, WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO SEE "ACE VENTURA", AND SOMETHING IN MY MORON BRAIN -- SOMETHING AGAIN ACTIVATED.
Jimmy: SHE SAID "I'M GONNA TURN THIS THING AROUND?"
AND SHE TURNED IT AROUND AGAIN. AND I WAS --
Jimmy: DID YOU EVER GET TO SEE THE MOVIE? I WAS LIKE "DAMN, I'M NEVER GONNA SEE THIS MOVIE." THE THIRD TIME, IT HAPPENED AGAIN. SHE TURNED THE CAR AROUND.
Jimmy: WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.
I SAW IT ON RENTAL. I SAW IT ON VIDEO.
Jimmy: OH, YOU DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT IN THEATERS.
I NEVER SAW IT IN THE THEATERS.
Jimmy: OKAY, YOU CAN TAKE OFF THE HEADPHONES NOW. ALL RIGHT, VERY GOOD. ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, WELL. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
WAIT, DO I -- NO, NO, I CAN BE A PART OF THIS.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU CAN BE A A PART OF THIS NOW. SCOTT, DO YOU REMEMBER -- I ASKED CHRIS WHAT HE DID THAT GOT HIM IN THE MOST TROUBLE GROWING UP. THERE WAS ONE TIME WHAT I HAD BEEN TOLD, I CRACKED MY HEAD OUT UP HERE -- AM I GETTING IT RIGHT?
Jimmy: YEAH, MAYBE.
I CRACKED MY HEAD OPEN, APPARENTLY A BUNCH, HAVEN'T BROKEN ELSE ANYTHING EXCEPT MY SKULL. WE WERE, LIKE, IN A CAR RIDE OR SOMETHING, I HAD BUTTERFLY BAND AIDS AND STITCHES AND EVERYTHING. HE GOT MAD AT ME, AND THE STORY -- ALWAYS A POINT OF THE STORY, IT WAS PETER PAN PAPERBACK BOOK.
GREAT SUGGESTION. AND HE WHACKED ME ON THE HEAD WITH IT, RIGHT WHERE I HAD IT. AND IT LITERALLY, THE STITCHES EXPLODED. MY SKIN -- [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: CHRIS, I'M GOING TO TURN THIS CAR RIGHT AROUND.

AND THE BLOOD WAS SQUIRTING TO THE WINDOWS. I KNEW RIGHT AWAY, IT WAS WHACK AND --
I'M DONE. I'M DONE. OVER.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD. YOU GOT NO POINTS FOR THAT.
THAT WASN'T IT?
Jimmy: THAT WAS NOT IT, NO.

Jimmy: -- JUST OWNED UP TO IT. I LOVE IT.
HE JUST WANTED TO BE DONE.
IT DIDN'T STAY THAT WAY.
Jimmy: WHAT MOVIE --
SO WE'RE AT ZERO.
Jimmy: WE'RE AT ZERO. WHAT MOVIE DID CHRIS WANT TO SEE THE MOST AS A KID?

"MARKED FOR DEATH" WITH JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME. PEOPLE ARE LIKE "WHAT'S YOUR FIRST RATED R MOVIE?" I'M LIKE "MARKED FOR DEATH."

"ACE VENTURA." WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE A PART OF THIS. YOU DIDN'T HANG OUT WITH ME THEN, THAT'S WHEN YOU GUYS WERE TOO COOL FOR ME.
Jimmy: OH, COME ON.
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN -- THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE TURNING POINT.

LIKE I SAID BEFORE, THERE'S, LITERALLY, A MILLION. BUT AS LIKE, A LITTLE BROTHER, I WAS LIKE "THAT'S AMAZING." NO, WERE OUT SIDE ONE TIME -- AND WE BOTH -- WE ENDED UP PLAYING OUTSIDE. LIKE NO TOYS, NOTHING, JUST LIKE IMAGINARY GAMES. WE BOTH HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. AND HE SAID TO ME, "WELL, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WANT TO GO INSIDE. OBVIOUSLY, THAT TAKES UP TOO MUCH TIME." HE'S LIKE "WHY DON'T WE JUST GO RIGHT NOW IN OUR PANTS." AND I WAS LIKE "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND OF COURSE -- WELL, OF COURSE -- HE'S COULD HAVE SAID ANYTHING, AND I'D OF BEEN LIKE "THAT SOUNDS AWESOME." SO HE WAS LIKE -- I WAS LIKE, AND THE SECOND I STARTED TO TRY TO LIKE, REFUSE, BE LIKE "NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S --" HE GOES "I'M GOING. I'M GOING RIGHT NOW. ARE YOU GOING?" AND I WAS LIKE, WELL, ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING. SO I STARTED TO GO AND I'M LIKE HALFWAY THROUGH WETTING MY PANTS, LIKE IT'S GETTING REAL WARM DOWN THE LEG. AND HE LOOKS AT ME AND STARTS KIND OF LAUGHING, AND HE GOES, "I DIDN'T GO."
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD, THAT IS THE WORST!
WAIT, OH, IT GETS WORSE. SO AT THAT MOMENT THAT I WAS LIKE "WAIT, YOU DIDN'T GO?" LIKE NOT EVEN REALIZING "HOW COULD THIS HAVE EVEN HAPPENED," OUR BABY-SITTER PULLS INTO THE DRIVE WAY FOR LIKE THE NIGHT. HE GOES RUNNING UP TO THE CAR. HE'S LIKE "STEPHANIE, SCOTT JUST WET HIS PANTS." [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH I DIDN'T.
Jimmy: BUT YOU DID. ALL RIGHT. CHRIS, YOU CAN TAKE THEM OFF. ALL RIGHT.
IT WAS REALLY WARM.
Jimmy: HERE WE GO, VERY GOOD. I ASKED SCOTT, AND THIS IS -- BOY, OH BOY. YOU'D BETTER FESS UP TO THIS. THIS IS -- I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MEANEST PRANK YOU EVER PLAYED ON HIM.
HE KNOWS.
Jimmy: DUDE, IT IS ROUGH. YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THIS -- THAT YOU DID THIS.
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES IT SO FUNNY, IS THAT I FEEL LIKE WE WERE --
TOO OLD.
Jimmy: WAIT, HOW OLD WERE YOU?
YOU DIDN'T -- IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS 6, I WAS PROBABLY LIKE 9 OR 10. [ LAUGHTER ]
IS THIS WHERE STEPHANIE --
I KNOW WHAT IT IS!
Jimmy: SO THAT'S THE STORY.
I KNOW WHAT IT IS, AND WE WERE TOO OLD.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, THERE YOU GO. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ONE POINT FOR THAT. [ DING ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ SCOTT AND CHRIS EVANS. "CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER" IS IN IMAX 3D IN THEATERS EVERYWHERE ON FRIDAY. RICKY JAY JOINS US NEXT. COME ON BACK, EVERYBODY. ♪♪
Jimmy: WE ARE JOINED RIGHT NOW BY A RENOWNED WRITER, HISTORIAN, ACTOR AND ONE OF THE ALL TIME GREAT ARTISTS IN THE FIELD OF MAGIC. HE'S ALSO THE SUBJECT OF A A RECENT DOCUMENTARY, IT'S GREAT, BY THE WAY" -- DECEPTIVE PRACTICES, THE MYSTERIES AND MENTORS OF RICKY JAY", WHICH IS NOW STREAMING ON NETFLIX. PLEASE WELCOME, A MASTER OF HIS CRAFT, HERE IS RICKY JAY. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: RICKY JAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. THANK YOU FOR VISITING US. YOU WERE IN THIS STUDIO BACK IN 1969.
OH, MY LORD.
Jimmy: YEAH, DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
I DO, IT WAS MY FIRST NATIONAL TELEVISION APPEARANCE. THIS GUY CALLED JOHNNY CARSON.
Jimmy: YES, THAT WHAT HIS NAME WAS. [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HOW OLD WERE YOU, THOUGH? YOU MUST HAVE BEEN YOUNG.
THE SHOW WAS CALLED "THE TONIGHT SHOW."
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I THINK I WAS JUST UNDER 21.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: JOHNNY LOVED MAGIC, DIDN'T HE?
HE REALLY DID. HE WAS ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD. BUT HE ALSO LIKED TO PLAY JOKES. JOHNNY SAID TO ME, "YOU AND I BOTH HAVE TO PRETEND THAT WE'RE GOING TO THE BATHROOM."
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. NO, IT HAPPENS A LOT. YEAH, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I FOUND THIS PHOTO OF YOU FROM THE 70's. IT'S JUST TOO COOL FOR ME TO NOT SHOW. THIS IS RICKY JAY IN THE 70's. ROCKIN' HIS LOOK.
OH, MY GOD.
Jimmy: THAT'S PRETTY ROCK 'N' ROLL RIGHT THERE, BROTHER. THAT IS SO ROCK STAR. AND WHAT ARE ALL THOSE THINGS IN THE PHOTO WITH YOU?
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. WATCH THE DOCUMENTARY. SO THAT YOUR BIG BREAK? OR, NO? "THE TONIGHT SHOW", OR?
NO, IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. I THINK BEFORE THAT, I HAD BEEN THE FIRST MUSICIAN WHO EVER WORKED WITH A ROCK ACT. I ACTUALLY OPENED AT THE ELECTRIC CIRCUS, I WAS SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN IKE AND TINA TURNER AND TIMOTHY LEARY DOING LECTURES ABOUT ACID.
Jimmy: NO WAY.
YEAH, REALLY. I REMEMBER VIVIDLY STANDING ON THE SIDE OF THE STAGE TRYING TO LOOK AT TINA'S CROCHETED DRESS.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. I KNOW THAT DRESS. NOW YOU'RE HOST THIS THING CALLED "RICKY JAY'S CONGRESS OF WONDERS." JULY 11th THROUGH THE 14th. WHAT IS THAT?
WELL, I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. IT'S AN INTENSIVE WEEKEND WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME FOR MAGIC APPRECIATION. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY FOR MAGICIANS, BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF DECEPTION. AND I'VE BEEN IN THIS MY WHOLE LIFE, AND I HAVE SOME WONDERFUL GUEST SPEAKERS. IT'S THIS INTENSIVE WEEKEND WITH ENTERTAINMENT. AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: AND JUST TELLING STORIES ABOUT LIKE OTHER MAGICIANS?
YEAH, LIKE, DECEPTION CAN BE USED IN VARIOUS WAYS. THINGS THAT DON'T SEEM CONVENTIONAL.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A STORY ABOUT A NICKEL.
A PERFECT EXAMPLE. WELL, I HAVE ACTUALLY, A GOLD PIECE. IN THE 1880's, THIS IS A GOLD PIECE, A $5 GOLD PIECE. AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S THE LETTER Z ON IT. THE OTHER SIDE WAS A LADY. AND YOU CAN ALL -- IT WAS A A COIN -- A TENDER, IT WAS WORTH $5.
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND THE THING THAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT IT, WAS CURRENCY CAME OUT IN DIFFERENT TIMES AND DIFFERENT STYLES. THERE WAS A GUY NAMED JOSH TATUM WHO USED TO MAKE HIS MONEY DOING ODDS AND ENDS AND HE'D GET PAID A NICKEL AN HOUR. AND THERE WAS A NICKEL ISSUED IN 1883 THAT LOOKED ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THIS GOLD COIN. IT HAD THE LADY ONE SIDE AND THE ROMAN NUMERAL "V", WHICH STOOD FOR FIVE. BUT THEY FORGOT TO PUT THE WORD CENTS ON THE COIN, SO IT JUST SAID 5. AND HE REALIZED IT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE THE $5 COLD PIECE. SO HE WENT OUT AND HAD THOUSANDS OF NICKELS GOLD PLATED. AND WHAT HE WOULD DO WAS HE'D WALK INTO A STORE AND HE WOULD ASK FOR $5 -- EXCUSE ME, 5 CENTS WORTH OF MERCHANDISE. A FIVE CENT CIGAR OR HANDFUL OF LICORICE. AND THEN HE WOULD PUT THIS GOLD PIECE ON THE COUNTER. IT WAS HIS NICKEL THAT WAS GOLD PLATED, AND HE WOULDN'T SAY A A WORD. AND THE SHOP KEEPER WOULD PICK UP THE COIN AND HAND HIM $4.95 IN CHANGE AND GIVE HIM HIS LICORICE.
Jimmy: GENIUS.
HE DID THIS THOUSANDS OF TIMES, 5,000 TIMES BEFORE HE WAS CAUGHT. AND THEY FINALLY BROUGHT HIM TO COURT ON CHARGES. AND HIS LAWYER SAID "THERE'S NO CRIME THAT'S EVER BEEN COMMITTED." IT'S NOT ILLEGAL TO GOLD PLATE A PIECE OF UNITED STATES CURRENCY. AND MY CLIENT JOSH TATUM NEVER ONCE SAID "CAN I HAVE CHANGE FOR A $5 COIN." AND THE OPPOSING ATTORNEY SAID, JUST A MINUTE, I CAN'T BELIEVE IN 5,000 TRANSACTIONS, YOUR CLIENT NEVER SPOKE. AND IT WAS AT THAT POINT THE LAWYER ANNOUNCED THAT JOSH TATUM WAS A DEAF MUTE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WOW. OH, MY GOSH. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A GREAT STORY. THAT'S A GREAT STORY.
SO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. FROM THAT POINT ON, THE UNITED STATES PASSED A LAW THAT YOU HAD TO ALWAYS PUT CENTS NEXT TO THE FIVE, AND YOU COULD NEVER AGAIN PLATE A PIECE OF U.S. CURRENCY.
Jimmy: GREAT STORY. THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME THAT. NOW, YOU WERE SAYING BACKSTAGE THAT YOU WANTED TO PLAY POKER AGAINST ME?
WELL, THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU DON'T PAY MUCH, IN GENERAL, ON THE SHOW.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, YEAH. PERFECT, YEAH. WE'LL TRY TO MAKE SOME MONEY BACK. ALL RIGHT, RICKY JAY AND I ARE PLAYING POKER AFTER THE BREAK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STICK AROUND, COME ON. ♪♪
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK HERE, EVERYBODY, I'M HERE WITH RICKY JAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS JULY -- JULY 11th THROUGH THE 14th, YOU CAN ATTEND RICKY JAY'S CONGRESS OF WONDERS AT THE BEEKMAN ARMS IN RHINEBECK, NEW YORK. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THAT, GO TO RICKYJAY.COM. NOW AT THIS CONGRESS OF WONDERS, ONE OF THE THINGS YOU TALK ABOUT IS THE CONCEPT OF CHEATING.
YEAH, YEAH. WELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -- I'M TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT MAGIC AMUSE. BUT CHEATING OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S SOME RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT A A MAGICIAN MIGHT DO IN SLIGHT OF HAND. BUT, OBVIOUSLY, THE CONCEPT OF IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU WOULD USE IN A MAGIC PERFORMANCE. LET'S SAY WE WERE PLAYING A A GAME OF CARDS, AND I HEAR YOU DON'T PLAY A LOT OF POKER, SO I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS REALLY SIMPLE BY USING ONLY 10 CARDS. FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN CARDS.
Jimmy: 10 CARD POKER, OKAY.
NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY TEN CARDS, IS GIVE YOU A CHOICE OF TAKING A CARD FROM THIS END OR THIS END. SO LET'S SAY I TOOK THIS CARD, YOU WOULD THEN HAVE A CHOICE OF TAKING THIS CARD OR THIS CARD FOR YOUR HAND.
Jimmy: THAT'S CORRECT.
YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SIZING ME UP, ARE YOU?
Jimmy: I'M PRETTY GOOD AT THIS STUFF. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
EXPERIENCE TELLS ME YOU MAY BE BETTER THAN I THOUGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, BIG BOY, I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, THIS ONE OR THIS ONE, YES?
YOU CAN TAKE THIS ONE TOO. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL LET YOU SEE THIS ONE AND YOU CAN STILL DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT THIS ONE OR THAT ONE. [ CHEERS ] YOU WANT IT?
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU KNOW IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE THIS ONE, BUT HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO LET YOU DO NOW. I'M GONNA LET YOU LOOK AT BOTH OF THESE CARDS AND TAKE EITHER ONE. NOW THIS IS AN ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE.
Jimmy: YES.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE THIS ONE. TAKE OF THE END ONES, EITHER ONE.
Jimmy: THIS ONE? YOU LOOK LIKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MIGHT LOSE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
I LOST BETTING ON MARCH MADNESS AS WELL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. TAKE THE LAST ONE.
Jimmy: HERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT, TURN THEM OVER AND SEE BEFORE WE GO.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA GO WITH THIS ONE HERE FIRST. THAT'S AWFUL. GOSH.
OH NO. A PAIR OF 8s. A PAIR OF 8s AND SOME PEOPLE SAY IF DEUCES ARE WILD, THAT'S A VERY STRONG --
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT THEY'RE NOT WILD ARE THEY?
I'M GONNA SAY NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?
NO, 'CAUSE YOU GET NO DRAW. SO THIS IS -- OH GOD, I DON'T EVEN HAVE A PAIR.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T?
NO, I DO HAVE A ROYAL STRAIGHT FLUSH, BUT I -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, THIS GUY'S AWESOME. RICKY JAY, EVERYBODY. MORE "TONIGHT SHOW" AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND. THAT IS THE WAY TO DO IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
