Jimmy: WE ALWAYS DO FUN STUFF WHEN YOU COME ON. I ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS IT. CONGRATS ON EVERYTHING, DUDE. I JUST SAW YOU AT THE "SNL" 40th.
OH MY GOD. YOU WERE INCREDIBLE. YOU WERE WORKING YOUR BUTT OFF AT THE AFTERPARTY. I BET YOU THOUGHT YOUR JOB WAS DONE WHEN THE SHOW WAS OVER.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, YEAH. YEAH I HAD NO IDEA -- DAN AYKROYD WAS LIKE, "COME ON UP. DO YOU WANT TO SING WITH ME?"
RIGHT.
Jimmy: I GO, "SURE." I GET UP, SAME THING WITH PAUL McCARTNEY. THEN HE LEFT. THEN PAUL LEFT.
OH MY GOD. I KNOW, BUT WHAT YOU DID UP THERE WAS AMAZING. I WAS HANGING OUT A LITTLE BIT WITH YOUR WIFE NANCY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SHE REALIZED OH, MY GOD, JIMMY'S BEEN UP THERE ALL THIS TIME AND NOBODY IS FORTIFYING HIM WITH A COCKTAIL, WE'VE GOT TO GO GET HIM A GIN AND TONIC.
Jimmy: I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU KNOW I LOVE MY GIN AND TONICS.
AND SO WE FOUGHT THROUGH THE CROWDS AND I WAS LIKE, "WELL I COULD USE A WHISKEY AND GINGER ALE RIGHT ABOUT NOW." SO THIS IS GOOD. A TWO-FER. WELL, I LIKE A FRESQUILA.

I HANDED HER THE DRINK SAYING, "GIVE IT TO HIM." BUT SHE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. SO SHE TOOK THE DRINK AND PUT IT ON THE PIANO, AT WHICH POINT I REALIZED I GAVE HER MY DRINK. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE, OH NO, THIS IS A COMPLETE AND UTTER DISASTER BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT MY DRINK ON THE PIANO.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE WANTING THAT ONE, YEAH.

AND I SAID, "LET'S MAKE" -- THAT'S WHEN I GRABBED NANCY FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND I SAID, "WE NEED TO IMPACT THIS TO HAPPEN." SO WE BROUGHT THEM UP THERE AND GOT YOUR ATTENTION.
