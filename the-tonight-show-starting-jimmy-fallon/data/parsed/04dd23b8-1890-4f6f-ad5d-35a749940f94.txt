Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- WILL FORTE, HALEY BENNETT, GRACE VANDERWAAL, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 540! VIRGINIA!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME! I FEEL THE LOVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYONE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. I'M HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT SHOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, GUYS. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. A WHITE HOUSE EMAIL ACCOUNT WAS HACKED, AND A LOT OF THEIR INFORMATION WAS LEAKED YESTERDAY. THEY'RE SAYING THE INFORMATION WAS STOLEN FROM THE GMAIL ACCOUNT OF A LOW-LEVEL STAFFER. THEN JOE BIDEN WAS LIKE, "TECHNICALLY, MY TITLE IS VICE PRESIDENT." [ LAUGHTER ] "LOW-LEVEL STAFFER." OF COURSE, THE CANDIDATES ARE BUSY GETTING READY FOR THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES THIS COMING MONDAY. GET THIS. APPARENTLY, HILLARY CLINTON HAS SHOWN AN ESPECIALLY GOOD FEEL FOR THE TIMERS THEY USE IN DEBATES. YEAH, THEY SAY SHE HAS AN INNATE SENSE OF WHEN TIME IS RUNNING OUT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN, DEMOCRATS SAID, "WHERE THE HELL HAS IT BEEN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS? HEY, COME ON! LET'S GO!" [ APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP IS NOT PREPARING AS MUCH FOR THE DEBATE. HE'S -- NO. BUT HIS CAMPAIGN IS RUNNING A A CONTEST WHERE THE WINNER GETS A TAKE A RIDE ON TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN PLANE. SECOND PLACE WINNER GETS TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT SOUNDS FUN.
Steve: WOW!
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD DEAL.
Steve: THAT'S A GOOD PRIZE.
Jimmy: LISTEN TO THIS. IN AN UPCOMING "FRONTLINE" SPECIAL, FORMER "APPRENTICE" STAR OMAROSA CLAIMS THAT EVERYONE WHO CRITICIZES HIM WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO, QUOTE, "BOW DOWN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP." [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] IN RESPONSE, PEOPLE SAID, "THIS IS AMERICA, AND WE DON'T BOW DOWN TO ANYONE. BESIDES BEYONCE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT THAT'S IT. BEYONCE. QUEEN BEE. AND THIS IS JUST WEIRD. LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE GARY JOHNSON WAS ASKED -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU GOT TO THIS. NO, YOU GOT TO SEE THIS. HE WAS ASKED HOW HE WOULD DO IF HE WERE ALLOWED AT THE DEBATE, IF HE WAS AT THE DEBATE, HOW HE WOULD DO, AND HE WOUND UP GIVING A PRETTY INTERESTING RESPONSE HERE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
DO YOU THINK IF YOU WERE ABLE TO GET ON THE DEBATE STAGE THAT YOU COULD PULL EVEN WITH TRUMP AND CLINTON IN THESE POLLS?
I DO. AND IT WOULDN'T BE -- IT WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MY DEBATE PERFORMANCE EITHER. [ MUMBLING ] AND NOT SAY ANYTHING -- [ MUMBLING ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WHAT? GOD.
Jimmy: HILLARY WAS LIKE, "AND YOU GUYS ARE WORRIED ABOUT MY HEALTH?" I MEAN THIS IS JUST -- [ MUMBLING ] BUT, WITH THE ELECTION SO CLOSE, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TIME IN OFFICE IS WINDING DOWN. OF COURSE, OBAMA HAS CHANGED A A LOT DURING HIS PRESIDENCY. IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW MUCH HE'S CHANGED, WE ACTUALLY GOT 2016 OBAMA TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH 2009 OBAMA. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
AND I PROMISE YOU, IF YOU OCCUPY THIS JOB LONG ENOUGH, YOU'RE GONNA, IN SOME WAYS AND SOME AREAS, FALL SHORT OF THE IDEAL.
YOU CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T BE PUNISHED FOR THAT. THAT'S JUST PILING ON.
LET'S FACE IT. THE EASIEST WAY TO GET ON TELEVISION RIGHT NOW IS TO BE REALLY RUDE RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T GET TIME ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS.
WELL, I --
THE SECOND PIECE OF ADVICE IS, ALWAYS USE PURELL HAND SANITIZER -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF COLDS BECAUSE YOU SHAKE A LOT OF HANDS.
THIS IS NOT THE BIGGEST ISSUE FACING THE COUNTRY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT IS NOT THE BIGGEST ISSUE. AND IN A NEW INTERVIEW WITH "VANITY FAIR", PRESIDENT OBAMA REVEALED THAT HE OFTEN WRITES ANGRY LETTERS TO PEOPLE WHEN HE'S UPSET, BUT THEN CRUMPLES THEM UP WITHOUT SENDING THEM. WELL, WE ACTUALLY GOT OUR HANDS ON A FEW OF THOSE CRUMPLED UP LETTERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH. CHECK OUT WHAT OBAMA WAS SO MAD ABOUT. HERE'S THE FIRST LETTER. HE SAID, "DEAR PUTIN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN? HOW COULD YOU NOT SHOW UP TO THE U.N.? WELL, GUESS WHAT, 'U' AND 'N' ARE THE FIRST TWO LETTERS OF ME UNINVITING YOU TO MY POOL PARTY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, WHO CARES, RIGHT? I'M SURE YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR SHIRT OFF. OH, YEAH, TELL TRUMP I SAID HI. BARACK." [ APPLAUSE ] CRUMBLED IT UP.
Steve: CRUMPLED IT UP AND THREW IT AWAY. WE GOT IT. SECURITY IS NOT TIGHT.
Jimmy: WE HAVE ANOTHER.
Steve: ARE YOU SERIOUS?
Jimmy: WE HAVE ANOTHER LETTER.
Steve: NO WONDER THEY'RE GETTING HACKED ALL THE TIME.
Jimmy: HE WROTE, "DEAR TIME WARNER CABLE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T GET YOUR DAMN DVR FAST-FORWARD BUTTON TO WORK PROPERLY. I HIT THE BUTTON, AND IT WENT BACKWARDS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE DAMN SHOW. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE THREE HOURS TO WATCH ONE EPISODE OF 'TINY HOUSE HUNTERS.'" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "TINY HOUSE HUNTERS?" WHAT AM I DOING? WHY AM I WRITING THIS?
Steve: GOT IT. THAT'S ALL YOU GOT.
Jimmy: NO, WE HAVE ONE MORE LETTER.
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: YES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: FINALLY, HE SAID, "DEAR SPRINT SPOKESMAN WHO USED TO WORK FOR VERIZON. WHAT THE HELL, DUDE? WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO LOYALTY? IF PAUL RYAN CAN STICK WITH DONALD TRUMP, YOU CAN STICK WITH THE WIRELESS CARRIER THAT MADE YOU FAMOUS. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW, BITCH?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHOA! CRUMPLE IT UP --
Steve: WOW!
Jimmy: AND TOSS IT IN THE GARBAGE. WELL, GET THIS, MARK ZUCKERBERG'S WIFE, PRISCILLA, SAYS THEIR 10-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER WON'T BE ALLOWED TO SIGN UP FOR FACEBOOK UNTIL SHE'S 13, BECAUSE SHE HAS TO FOLLOW THE RULES. THAT'S SO SWEET THAT SHE THINKS TEENS WILL STILL BE INTO FACEBOOK IN 13 YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, "LAME, MOM! EVERYONE'S ON TWIZZLEBONK! YOU CAN'T BE ON IT! I'M ON IT! IT'S FOR KIDS!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO EMBARASSSING! GIVE ME MY JET PACK! [ LAUGHTER ] STOP FOLLOWING ME AROUND!"
Steve: BLEEP BLORP.
Jimmy: THIS IS VERY INTERESTING HERE. NEW DATA FINDS THAT MORE AMERICANS ARE BRINGING THEIR OWN LUNCH TO WORK EVERY DAY. YEAH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE INSIDE OF YOUR BREAK ROOM MICROWAVE THAT LOOKS LIKE A A TRIPLE HOMICIDE JUST TOOK PLACE. [ LAUGHTER ] "COVER YOUR CHILI, CARL!" "I WASN'T EVEN THE ONE EATING CHILI!" [ LAUGHTER ] "I'M SORRY, CARL. I JUST HAD A ROUGH DAY." "OKAY." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: MY GOSH. "I BROUGHT QUAIL."
Jimmy: "I WAS JUST BARKED AT AND RIPPED A NEW ONE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: "CALL THE SURGEON."
Jimmy: "I NEED TO TAKE AN HOUR LUNCH."
Steve: HARSH.
Jimmy: YEAH, SORRY, CARL. FINALLY, IT WAS REPORTED TODAY THAT DUE TO HIS ROLE IN THE BRIDGE GATE SCANDAL, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE COULD FACE IMPEACHMENT. WHEN HE HEARD THAT, CHRISTIE SAID, "MMM, PEACH, MINT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

PLUS FROM THE NEW MOVIES "THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN" AND "THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN", TWO GIANT MOVIES, HALEY BENNETT IS STOPPING BY.

YES, AND THAT'S ALMOND BROTHERS WITH A "D" -- NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND, WHO AS EVERYONE KNOWS ARE A BUNCH OF THIEVING HACKS WHO STOLE OUR CAREERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, LET'S NOT GET INTO THAT. GREGG, JUST REMIND ME. HOW DID THE ALMOND BROTHERS BAND GET TOGETHER?
WELL, JIMMY, THE CORE OF THE GROUP HAS ALWAYS BEEN ME AND MY IDENTICAL COUSIN, RANDY ALMOND. [ LAUGHTER ] WE BONDED IN HIGH SCHOOL OVER TWO THINGS -- OUR LOVE OF GOOD OLD-FASHIONED AMERICAN ROCK MUSIC AND A LIFE-THREATENING ALLERGY TO NUTS AND LEGUMES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAIT A SECOND. WAIT, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO NUTS? FROM THE NAME, ALMOND BROTHERS, THAT KIND OF SEEMS LIKE YOU LOVE ALMONDS.
YEAH, JIMMY, THAT IS A A COMMON MISCONCEPTION. IN FACT, IT HAS BEEN VERY CONFUSING TO OUR FANS AS WELL. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, OFTEN THEY WILL SHOW UP TO OUR CONCERTS AND THROW HANDFULS OF ROASTED ALMONDS AT US, RESULTING IN SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO THE HANDS AND FACE. I, MYSELF, HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OVER 397 TIMES -- [ LAUGHTER ] FOR NUT-RELATED ISSUES, YEAH.

YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU WOULDN'T JUST SAY OVER 400, NO. WHY DON'T YOU JUST -- [ LAUGHTER ] SORRY, I'M LAUGHING AT SOMETHING ELSE. THIS JOKE I HEARD EARLIER. GREGG, WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL YOUR FANS THAT YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ALMONDS?
WELL, JIMMY, WE DID TRY. ESPECIALLY ON OUR 1 1976 ALBUM, "PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR NUTS ON US." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I THINK I -- DO WE HAVE THAT? I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THAT ALBUM HERE. DO WE? OH, NO, WE DO. ACTUALLY, WE HAVE THAT ALBUM HERE. THIS IS IT. "PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR NUTS ON US" -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE ALMOND BROTHERS.
YOU KNOW, SADLY, THAT -- SOMEHOW THAT JUST EMBOLDENED PEOPLE TO THROW MORE ALMONDS AT US. [ LAUGHTER ] IN FACT, THE CONSTANT NUT-CHUCKING BECAME SUCH A A PROBLEM THAT WE HAD TO STOP TOURING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CONSTANT NUT-CHUCKING? I MEAN, THAT'S --
Steve: THAT'S THE WORST.
Jimmy: WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST CHANGE THE NAME OF THE BAND?
WELL, WE DID. YOU KNOW, FOR A WHILE, WE CALLED OURSELVES THE NOT THE ALMOND BROTHERS, BUT THAT JUST CONFUSED PEOPLE EVEN MORE.
Jimmy: I SEE. I SEE. AND YOUR COUSIN, RANDY, IS NO LONGER WITH US, IS THAT CORRECT?
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY, WE LOST RANDY A A YEAR AGO. MISS YOU, CUZ. MISS YOU EVERY DAY, EVERY DAMN DAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LIKE, NOT WITH US ANYMORE. YOU WANT TO DO -- WHICH ONE IS HE? [ LAUGHTER ] IS THIS HIM?
