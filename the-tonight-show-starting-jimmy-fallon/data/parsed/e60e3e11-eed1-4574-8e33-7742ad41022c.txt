Questlove: NEW MEXICO! YEAH!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! WELCOME, EVERYBODY, WELCOME! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME! WELCOME, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, HEY! WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW," THIS IS IT, BABY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT, BABY! YOU MADE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY IS TED CRUZ, WHO GAVE A SPEECH AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION LAST NIGHT WHERE HE REFUSED TO ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT. AND HE'S NOT BACKING DOWN. IN FACT, CRUZ SAID THIS MORNING THAT HE WON'T BE A "SERVILE PUPPY DOG" FOR TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID, "WHATEVER, MORE BEGGIN' STRIPS FOR ME." I MEAN I -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE SHOULDN'T -- HE SHOULDN'T EAT THOSE. THEY'RE NOT FOR HUMANS.
Steve: DID HE REALLY SAY THAT?
Jimmy: THEY'RE NOT FOR HUMANS.
Steve: THAT'S A DOG TREAT.
Jimmy: THEY'RE FOR ANIMALS. YEAH, NO, THEY'RE NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.
Steve: THAT'S INSANE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TED CRUZ REFUSED -- REFUSED TO ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP IN HIS SPEECH AT THE CONVENTION LAST NIGHT, AND THE CROWD WASN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT. CHECK IT OUT.
STAND AND SPEAK, AND VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE, VOTE FOR CANDIDATES UP AND DOWN THE TICKET WHO YOU TRUST. [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DON'T BOO HIM, BOOING ONLY MAKES HIM STRONGER. [ LAUGHTER ] [ AS CRUZ ] "I CAN FEEL YOUR ANGER FLOW THROUGH ME." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WOULD EVEN INVITE TED CRUZ TO SPEAK AT THE CONVENTION IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT TURNS OUT BEN CARSON SUMMONED HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE BY SAYING THE WORD "LUCIFER" THREE TIMES.
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND THAT'S -- YEAH, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. IF YOU DO THAT HE'S GOING TO SHOW UP. [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS REALLY FUNNY, THOUGH. I LOVE THIS. TED CRUZ ACTUALLY GAVE A SPEECH OUTSIDE THE CONVENTION YESTERDAY BEFORE HIS BIG PRIME TIME SPEECH LAST NIGHT. DID YOU SEE THIS? OUTSIDE?
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: HE'S OUTDOORS. CHECK OUT WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT AS HE'S TALKING ABOUT HOW HE WOULDN'T BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. WATCH THIS.
OUR PARTY NOW HAS A NOMINEE. AND I DON'T KNOW -- [ AUDIENCE BOOS ]
Jimmy: KINDA ZOOM IN ON -- LOOK, IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT MADE UP. LOOK AT THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THAT IS THE BEST. THAT IS THE -- [ APPLAUSE ] I THINK THE ONLY THING MISSING WAS A GIANT BANNER THAT SAID, "SUCK IT, LOSER." YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] OH, MY GOD. WHAT A BURN, MAN. OH, MY GOD. MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE MIKE PENCE GAVE A A SPEECH AT THE CONVENTION LAST NIGHT AND EVEN POKED FUN AT THE FACT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS. YEAH. I GUESS EVEN DONALD TRUMP CALLS HIM "VICE PRESIDENT HEY, BUDDY." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. MIKE PENCE OFFICIALLY BECAME THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR VICE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT, AND TRUMP DECIDED TO GREET HIM WITH A KISS TO CELEBRATE. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, GET READY. SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT WAS A A LITTLE AWKWARD. YOU TELL ME.
DONALD TRUMP IS COMING OUT ON THE STAGE. THIS HIS THIRD APPEARANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: I GUESS NOT?
Jimmy: A LITTLE ROUGH THERE. A LITTLE ROUGH. BUT CONGRATS TO AL GORE WHO NO LONGER HAS THE MOST AWKWARD CONVENTION KISS OF ALL TIME. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: HEY! [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT?
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, I THINK THE KISS BETWEEN TRUMP AND PENCE ONLY APPEARED A LITTLE OFF BECAUSE IT WASN'T SET TO THE RIGHT MUSIC.
Steve: OH.
Jimmy: SO WE FIXED IT UP A A LITTLE BIT. I THINK IT WOULD HAVE WORKED A A LOT BETTER IF IT WENT LIKE THIS. ♪ NOW I'VE HAD ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ THE TIME OF MY LIFE AND I OWE IT ALL TO YOU ♪ ♪ I'VE HAD ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] [ FIREWORKS EXPLODING ] ♪♪ [ APPLAUSE ] GET THIS, A NEW POLL SHOWS THAT A GROWING NUMBER OF AMERICANS WANT BOTH PARTIES TO PUT THEIR DIFFERENCES ASIDE AND WORK TOGETHER.

Steve: OH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A GOOD COMPROMISE.
Jimmy: LET'S KEEP GOING. THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE STOP WATCHING PORNOGRAPHY. THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO PROTECT WILDLIFE IN THE NATIONAL PARKS FROM TOURISTS. THEY COMPROMISED, AND NOW, THEY'LL RELEASE A VIDEO OF A A BUFFALO HUMPING A MINIVAN. AND YOU GO -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: THERE YOU GO. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GONNA WORK, BUT THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER.
Steve: AT LEAST THEY'RE TOGETHER.
Jimmy: HERE'S THE LAST ONE. THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO STOP DONALD TRUMP FROM PREVENTING ACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROL. THEY COMPROMISED, AND NOW, PLANNED PARENTHOOD WILL HAND OUT PICTURES OF DONALD TRUMP AS BIRTH CONTROL. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THERE YOU GO. THOSE ARE THE COMPROMISES, EVERYBODY.
