THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL. OH, MY GOSH.
HELLO, NEW YORK! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THESE FEW PEOPLE RIGHT HERE. GOSH, YOU GUYS LOOK GREAT. I GOT TO SAY, THIS IS EXCITING THAT YOU DID THIS AND YOU CAME TOGETHER AND MADE THIS THING.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WHERE DID YOU MEET? HOW DID IT COME ABOUT? I DON'T SEE YOU GUYS HANGING OUT IN THE SAME PLACES. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU WANT ME TO TELL THEM?
YOU TELL THEM.
OKAY, WELL WE WERE PERFORMING -- I WAS PERFORMING AT THE ROBIN HOOD CHARITY EVENT IN NEW YORK. IT'S A WONDERFUL EVENT TO RAISE MONEY FOR ALL THE IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE IN NEW YORK. WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY, SURE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ROBIN HOOD IS GREAT. I KNOW.
SO I WAS SINGING THAT NIGHT, AND I DECIDED TO SING SOME STANDARDS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF RICH PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I HEAR YOU. VERY SMART, YEAH. KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE.
I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT LIKE IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I WAS SINGING SOME SONGS. AND THEN, AFTER THE SHOW WAS OVER, THEY SAID MR. BENNETT WOULD LIKE TO MEET YOU AND I SAID OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT TONY BENNETT WATCHED ME SING A A STANDARD. WHAT WAS I THINKING?
Jimmy: YEAH. LIKE, I CAN'T DO THAT. YEAH. TONY BENNETT'S THE MASTER, YEAH.
AND THEN WE MET BACKSTAGE. HE WANTED TO MEET ME, AND I BROUGHT MY FAMILY. AND IT WAS SO WONDERFUL. AND HE ASKED ME RIGHT THEN AND THERE TO MAKE A RECORD, AND I SAID YES.
Jimmy: I MEAN, COME ON. AND NOW HERE IT IS, "CHEEK TO CHEEK". CONGRATULATIONS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO GOOD. I MEAN, AND YOU ALSO HANG OUT OUTSIDE OF RECORDING. YOU GUYS BECAME FAST FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU'RE BOTH NEW YORKERS. WHICH IS GOOD. WHICH IS GOOD. TONY, YOU ONCE TOLD ME THIS STORY THAT YOU TOOK ADVICE ONCE FROM A CABBIE. A CAB DRIVER GAVE YOU ADVICE, RIGHT?
RIGHT. I GOT IN A NEW YORK CAB DRIVER, AND YEARS AGO, THEY HAD GREAT PERSONALITIES, DRIVING THE CABS.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
AND HE SAID, "OH, YOU'RE AN ENTERTAINER." HE SAID, "ALL THESE ENTERTAINERS -- ALL YOU ENTERTAINERS ARE LOUSY." [ LAUGHTER ] I SAID --
Jimmy: I LOVE NEW YORK.
I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?" AND HE SAID, WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE THE OLD DAYS WHERE PEOPLE NEVER -- ONCE THEY USE MICROPHONES, HE SAID, EVERYBODY'S A PHONY. HE SAID YOU HAVE TO SING WITHOUT A MICROPHONE.
REAL THEATER.
Jimmy: YEAH, LIKE ETHEL MERMAN WOULD SING WITHOUT -- THEY WOULD JUST FILL THE HALL OR WHATEVER. SO SING WITHOUT A MICROPHONE. GREAT ADVICE.
SO TO THIS DAY, WHENEVER I'M IN AN ACOUSTICAL HALL, IN CONCERT, I SING WITHOUT THE MICROPHONE.
Jimmy: DO YOU REALLY?
AND PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT MORE THAN THE WHOLE SHOW.
IT'S ALWAYS AT THE END OF THE SHOW. IT'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT? NO WAY!
YES, IT IS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT YOU TOOK THAT ADVICE.
AND HE'S VERY CUTE. HE DOES THIS THING TOO WHEN IT'S OVER. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE HE SINGS OUT AND IT FILLS THE WHOLE THEATER. THEN HE GOES -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S SHOW BUSINESS. HE KNOWS HOW TO DO IT. ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. I LOVE THAT. LADY GAGA, HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN ADVICE FROM A STRANGER?
WELL, YES. BUT I -- YOU KNOW I THINK MY STORY IS PROBABLY LESS CLASSY THAN TONY'S.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WELL -- SO YOU KNOW SO I GET INVITES A A LOT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW -- SOME PEOPLE -- MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE, BECAUSE I LIKE TO CHANGE SO MUCH.
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
AND I WAS AT THE CLERMONT LOUNGE IN ATLANTA, THE STRIP CLUB.
Jimmy: OF COURSE. YEAH, YEAH, OF COURSE.
I WAS ON A DATE. AND --
Jimmy: GREAT PLACE FOR A A DATE.
YES, IT WAS VERY ROMANTIC. CHIVALRY. AND THE NIGHT WAS CALLED, "WHERE STRIPPERS GO TO DIE." SO IT'S LIKE WITH THIS LIKE THIS --
Jimmy: I REMEMBER THAT YEAR, YEAH. THAT WAS A GOOD SCORE, YEAH.
I THINK THE WOMAN MUST HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW, 65-70 YEARS OLD, THAT IT WAS STRIPPING, AND SHE WAS FABULOUS. BUT SHE WAS DOING SOMETHING TO "POKER FACE". THAT SHE WAS LIKE DOING THIS WHOLE FADE, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW, SHE HAD NO PANTIES ON. AND IT WAS -- YOU KNOW, IT WAS -- I'M SORRY, TONY.
THAT'S ALRIGHT.
Jimmy: EARMUFFS. EARMUFFS, YEAH.
SHE LEANS OVER AND SHE GOES, YOU KNOW THAT LADY GAGA? I MEAN, SHE CAN REALLY SING. I MEAN IF SHE JUST TOOK ALL THOSE CLOTHES OFF AND SHE JUST SANG, SHE WOULD BE GREAT. AND I WAS GOING, MM-HMM. OKAY WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY TAKEN ALL YOUR CLOTHES OFF. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU'VE DONE QUITE ENOUGH, YEAH.
SO YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW, MAYBE IN SOME WAYS I TOOK HER ADVICE. YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: DID YOU FINALLY TELL HER THAT IT WAS YOU?
I DID AT THE END. AND THEN SHE ASKED ME TO SIGN A A BEER CAN THAT SHE CRUSHED BETWEEN HER BREASTS.
Jimmy: OH, WHAT A NICE LADY. WHAT A NICE LADY. I JUST WANT TO SAY --
IT'S SHOWBIZ!
Jimmy: IT'S SHOWBIZ. AND I WANT TO -- I WANT TO THANK MY MOTHER FOR GIVING YOU THAT ADVICE. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE HAS BEEN STRIPPING FOR -- 30 YEARS IN THE BUSINESS, EVERYBODY. 30 YEARS WORKING IN THE BUSINESS. SHE'S A DANCER. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, THIS IS -- SO, YOU GUYS -- THESE ARE ALL JAZZ STANDARDS. AND TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO DO A MEDLEY FOR US, IS THAT RIGHT?
WELL A MEDLEY'S TECHNICALLY THREE SONGS. WE'RE DOING TWO.
Jimmy: YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY. OKAY. WOW.
WE'RE GOING TO BE SINGING "CHEEK TO CHEEK."
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SINGING "IT DON'T MEAN A A THING."
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. I'M SO THANKFUL, I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
