Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- AARON PAUL, TIG NOTARO, MUSICAL GUEST FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 519! ONTARIO!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HEY EVERYONE! WELCOME, WELCOME! GREAT. HAVE A SEAT. ENJOY YOURSELVES. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME EVERYONE. WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN TONIGHT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL NOT ATTEND THE FINAL CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE EVENT IN NEW YORK NEXT MONTH, BECAUSE OF A A SCHEDULING CONFLICT. WHEN ASKED WHAT THE CONFLICT WAS, OBAMA WAS LIKE, "COULD BE THE 9th HOLE, MAYBE THE 10th HOLE. IT'S HARD TO SAY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I NEVER PLAYED THERE. I DON'T KNOW." SPEAKING OF PRESIDENT OBAMA. I SAW THAT THE MOVIE "SOUTHSIDE WITH YOU" COMES OUT THIS WEEK. IT TELLS THE STORY OF BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA'S FIRST DATE. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT A FIRST DATE THAT LEADS TO MARRIAGE WHICH MAKES IT A VERY AWKWARD MOVIE TO GO SEE ON A FIRST DATE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WILL YOU MARRY ME? I DON'T KNOW. APPARENTLY THE MOVIE REVEALS THAT WHEN BARACK AND MICHELLE MET SHE ACTUALLY REJECTED HIM AT FIRST. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] IN FACT, BARACK WAS SO PERSISTENT, MICHELLE STARTED A A CAMPAIGN CALLED "LET'S MOVE ON." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE WAY -- SHE'S ALWAYS INTO THAT.
Steve: THAT'S THE WAY SHE ROLLS.
Jimmy: I ALSO READ THAT CNN IS PREMIERING A NEW DOCUMENTARY NEXT WEEK CALLED "ALMOST PRESIDENT: THE AGONY OF DEFEAT." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT HAS INTERVIEWS WITH MITT ROMNEY -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] JOHN McCAIN AND MICHAEL DUKAKIS. JEB BUSH WAS LIKE, "WHAT ABOUT ALMOST, ALMOST PRESIDENT? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WANT TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT THAT? I'M AVAILABLE. COME BACK! COME BACK HERE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HERE IS THE LATEST ON THE ELECTION. AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR OF PROMISING MASS DEPORTATION OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, LAST NIGHT DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY REFERRED TO THEM AS GREAT PEOPLE. EVEN RYAN LOCHTE WAS LIKE, "GET YOUR STORY STRAIGHT, MAN." [ LAUGHTER ] ARE THEY GREAT PEOPLE? A BIT OF A SCANDAL HERE. MELANIA TRUMP IS GETTING READY TO SUE THE BRITISH NEWSPAPER "THE DAILY MAIL" FOR WRITING THAT SHE ONCE WORKED AS AN ESCORT. YEAH. MELANIA SAYS SHE STRONGLY DENIES THE ACCUSATION THAT SHE HAS EVER WORKED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HOW DARE YOU! IN THE MEANTIME, HILLARY CLINTON RECENTLY WROTE AN EDITORIAL FOR A NEWS SITE AIMED AT MILLENNIAL WOMEN. SHE SAYS SHE HAS MUCH TO LEARN FROM YOUNG PEOPLE. SPECIFICALLY, SHE WANTS TO LEARN HOW TO SWITCH FROM E-MAIL TO SNAPCHAT. [ LAUGHTER ] "YOUR MESSAGES GET DELETED AUTOMATICALLY? I WANT TO HEAR MORE." ♪ TELL ME MORE TELL ME MORE BAH DA BAH BAH ♪ LET'S GET TO SOME -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WOW!
Jimmy: THAT'S IT, YEAH. OH, LET'S GET TO SOME SPORTS.
Steve: OH, GOOD!
Jimmy: EVERYONE LOVES SPORTS. DID YOU GUYS HEAR ABOUT THIS? TIM TEBOW RECENTLY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO PURSUE A BASEBALL CAREER. TIM TEBOW. YEAH. MORE THAN 20 MAJOR LEAGUE TEAMS ARE PLANNING TO ATTEND HIS WORKOUT NEXT WEEK IN L.A. THAT'S RIGHT. HE'LL BE THE FIRST BASEBALL PLAYER TO THROW FROM THIRD TO FIRST AND GET INTERCEPTED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: IT'S MAKING HISTORY.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, "THE BACHELORETTE" WINNER, JORDAN RODGERS, HAS STARTED WORKING AS A TV COMMENTATOR FOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL. WHEN ASKED WHO HE THINKS WILL WIN A BIG GAME, HE'S THE ONLY ANALYST WHO GOES- - "THIS IS TOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M IN LOVE WITH BOTH TEAMS." [ APPLAUSE ] "I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO WITH MIAMI." THIS MADE ME LAUGH. YESTERDAY A MAN IN PITTSBURGH HAD TO BE RESCUED AFTER HE GOT STUCK -- THIS IS TRUE -- HE GOT STUCK TRYING TO JUMP BETWEEN TWO BUILDINGS TO IMPRESS A A WOMAN HE JUST MET. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AFTERWARD THE WOMAN ACTUALLY AGREED TO GO OUT ON A DATE WITH THE FIREMAN WHO RESCUED THAT IDIOT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S COOL. WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
Steve: I'M STUCK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GET THIS. A 9-YEAR-OLD DOG IN MINNESOTA WAS JUST ELECTED AS HIS TOWN'S MAYOR FOR A THIRD TERM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THE GUY RUNNING AGAINST THE DOG WAS LIKE, "WHY DO I STILL LIVE IN THIS TOWN?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIRD TIME I'VE LOST TO A A DOG --
Steve: I LOST TO A DOG.
Jimmy: I SHOULD MOVE, RIGHT?
Steve: SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ME.
Jimmy: SOMETHING'S WRONG.
Steve: A DOG HAS BEATEN ME THREE TIMES.
Jimmy: I THOUGHT THIS WAS INTERESTING. A NEW REPORT FINDS THAT A A RECORD 60 MILLION AMERICANS LIVE IN MULTIGENERATIONAL HOUSEHOLDS. YEAH. I THINK THAT'S JUST A FANCY WAY OF SAYING STILL LIVING WITH YOUR MOM. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS BASEMENT IS PART OF A A MULTIGENERATIONAL HOUSEHOLD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, THIS IS PRETTY BIG. I SAW THAT JENNIFER LAWRENCE WAS JUST NAMED THE WORLD'S HIGHEST PAID ACTRESS, BRINGING IN $46 MILLION LAST YEAR BEFORE TAXES.

OH, OH.
Jimmy: HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT? WHAT DO WE HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO WHEN WE WATCH THE SHOW "ONE MISSISSIPPI?" WHO DO YOU PLAY?
WELL, I PLAY A VERSION OF MYSELF. I HAVE TO SAY THAT A LOT OF MY FAMILY LIVES IN MISSISSIPPI STILL, AND MY COUSIN, WHEN HE HEARD I HAD A SHOW, TALKED TO THE LOCAL PAPER AND EXPLAINED, BEFORE HE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SHOW, THIS WAS BASICALLY TIG'S VERSION OF "EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND." AND IF YOU WATCH THE FIRST EPISODE, I'M JUST SITTING BY MY MOTHER'S DEATHBED FOR 30 MINUTES, WHILE I HAVE DIARRHEA. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO, IS THAT MY VERSION OF "EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND?"
Jimmy: I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT EPISODE OF "EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND", BUT YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE I MISSED IT.
YEAH, YEAH. ON A VERY SPECIAL,
Jimmy: YEAH, VERY SPECIAL. BUT SOMEHOW YOU MAKE THAT HUMOROUS. YOU MAKE THAT FUNNY.
I HOPE SO, YES.
Jimmy: NO, YOU DEFINITELY DO. AND WITH YOUR DELIVERY, AND JUST THE WAY YOU ARE, IT'S VERY, VERY TIG, WHICH I LOVE. WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. DO YOU WANT TO TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS CLIP?
THIS IS BASICALLY THE MOMENT THAT I ACTUALLY REALLY EXPERIENCE OF NOT KNOWING HOW TO LEAVE MY MOTHER AFTER SHE PASSES AWAY, WHICH IS A VERY CONFUSING TIME. AND SO I KIND OF SPLIT FROM REALITY TO DEAL.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW TIG NOTARO IN HER NEW SHOW "ONE MISSISSIPPI." CHECK IT OUT.
DID YOU NEED SOMETHING?
I THINK MY MOTHER --
YES. SORRY SHE'S GONE.
WHAT, WHAT HAPPENS NOW? DO I JUST LEAVE?
DO I JUST LEAVE? NO. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE YOUR MOTHER! [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW.
OH, MY GOSH. THAT WOULD BE JUST STRAIGHT UP NUTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M REALIZING THAT NOW.
