Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HI! MUAH! MUAH, MUAH, MUAH, MUAH, MUAH! WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT IT IS TONIGHT. WELCOME. YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY IS THAT THE VOTE ON THE REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL WAS DELAYED TODAY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO PASS IT. [ CHEERS ] WHEN HE HEARD THAT, OBAMA CALLED TRUMP AND SAID, "DON'T WORRY. OBAMA COVERS DEPRESSION. SO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. AT ONE POINT, CONGRESS WAS PREPARED TO VOTE AS LATE AS 3:00 A.M. CONGRESSMEN CALLED THEIR WIVES TOLD THEM NOT WAIT UP, THEN THEY CALLED THEIR MISTRESSES AND SAID, "SEE YA AT 3:00!" AND YOU KNOW -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY-YO!
Jimmy: BUT ACTUALLY, TRUMP WAS ON THE PHONE LAST NIGHT UNTIL ALMOST MIDNIGHT, CALLING REPUBLICANS TO TRY TO SWITCH THEIR VOTES ON THE BILL. ALL THE CALLS STARTED THE SAME WAY -- YOU HAVE A COLLECT CALL FROM -- DON'T HANG UP, LOSER. [ LAUGHTER ] PRESS ONE. [ APPLAUSE ] DON'T HANG UP, LOSER.
Steve: RUDE.
Jimmy: TRUMP SAID THE HARDEST PART WAS TALKING ON ONE PHONE AND TWEETING ON THE OTHER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT WAS -- MULTITASKING IS TOUGH. IT'S VERY HARD TO DO. THAT'S RIGHT, TRUMP WAS UP ALL NIGHT CALLING REPUBLICANS. HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE CALMED SOME DEMOCRATS, BUT FIGURED THEY WERE ALREADY ON THE LINE SPYING ON US. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. MEANWHILE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER SAYS THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY NO PLAN B FOR REPLACING OBAMACARE, AND WOMEN SAID, "YEAH. WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU GUYS STAND ON PLAN B. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU CAN STOP TALKING." LISTEN TO THIS. I READ THAT TRUMP IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN 150 YEARS WITHOUT A PET IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] THEN ANOTHER GUY SAID, "IT'S OKAY, BECAUSE I HAVE PET IN WHITE HOUSE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "ROLL OVER, DONALD." THERE ARE A LOT OF SCANDALS SURROUNDING THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. SO, TRUMP STARTED GIVING INTERVIEWS TO TELL HIS SIDE OF THE STORY. LET'S SEE HOW THAT'S GOING.
IN AN INTERVIEW JUST OUT WITH "TIME" MAGAZINE, THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT HIS WIRETAPPING CLAIMS AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA. AND IN AN ANSWER ABOUT QUESTIONS OF HIS CREDIBILITY, HE RESPONDED TO THE REPORTER, "I GUESS I CAN'T BE DOING SO BADLY BECAUSE I'M PRESIDENT AND YOU'RE NOT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEN THE REPORTER WAS LIKE, "TRUE, BUT YOU'RE BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI AND I AM NOT, SO" -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOME MORE NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE NEIL GORSUCH SAID HE DOESN'T SEE JUDGES AS DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, SAYING, "I SEE JUDGES." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE PLAN, GORSUCH SAID, "I SEE DEAD PEOPLE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND YOU GO, HEY, WHOA. HEY, NO SPOILERS.
