Jimmy: YOU GAVE THE INFORMATION OF WHERE THE PARTY WAS AND THEN IT SAID, THIS MESSAGE WILL SELF-DESTRUCT.
I'M VERY HIGH-CONCEPT, JIMMY.
Jimmy: YES, AND THEN IT SAID, YOU GO, "YOU BETTER WRITE THIS DOWN BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING IT REPEAT IT. IT'S GOING TO SELF-DESTRUCT." SO I WROTE THE ADDRESS DOWN AND IT BROKE, WHATEVER IT WAS YOU GAVE ME.

YOU WOULD ANNOUNCE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THE PARTY.
YES, I LOVE BEING A HOST. IT'S ABOUT HOSTING AND IT'S ABOUT GIVING. NOBODY IS GOING TO REMEMBER THE TAKERS, JIMMY.
Jimmy: NO.
NOBODY IS GOING TO REMEMBER THE TAKERS, THEY'RE GOING TO REMEMBER THE GIVERS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY, I LIKE THAT. I AGREE.
I HAVE TO GIVE A SHOUT-OUT TO PASTOR NOEL JONES, THAT WAS HIS SERMON THIS SUNDAY. I JUST SAMPLED NOEL JONES.
Jimmy: OH, HE'S FINE. WHAT'S HIS NAME, PASTOR WHO?

Jimmy: YOU DID SOMETHING GREAT WITH MARK WAHLBERG FOR FLINT, MICHIGAN, ALL OUR FRIENDS OVER IN FLINT.
YES.
Jimmy: THE AWFUL THING THAT HAPPENED WITH THE -- NO WATER. THEY HAVE NO DRINKING WATER. YOU GAVE ONE MILLION BOTTLES OF DRINKING WATER.

WE ALL DID IT TOGETHER. IT'S ABOUT GIVING BACK, AND SHOUT-OUT TO EVERYBODY IN FLINT. MAY THIS TRAGEDY TURN AROUND. AND GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES.
Jimmy: ANYTHING YOU CAN DO, YEAH, IT WOULD BE GREAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I THOUGHT THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. ABOVE AND BEYOND. THAT WAS SO COOL THAT YOU DID THAT. AND THEN YOU'RE DOING A CHARTER SCHOOL. YOU'RE OPENING THIS, THIS IS A A PROJECT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS PROBABLY FIVE YEARS AGO?
YES.
Jimmy: IN HARLEM.
FOR SIX YEARS, I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A PROJECT WITH STEVEN PERRY. HE'S A GREAT SCHOLAR, DR. STEVEN PERRY. HE HAS 100% GRADUATION RATES WITH HIS CHILDREN UP IN CONNECTICUT. I CALLED HIM, I SAID, "I HAVE THIS DREAM. I WANT TO OPEN UP A SCHOOL IN MY HOMETOWN OF HARLEM." HE WAS LIKE "OKAY, YOU WANT TO DO AN AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM, RIGHT?" I WAS LIKE "NO, NO, I WANT TO OPEN UP A SCHOOL. I WANT TO OPEN UP A SCHOOL WITH A REAL CURRICULUM TO TEACH OUR FUTURE LEADERS OF TOMORROW THAT'S COMING OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES." BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M WHERE I'M AT BECAUSE MY MOTHER GAVE ME AN INCREDIBLE EDUCATION. BUT SOME PEOPLE, THEY DON'T GET THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO, IN HARLEM, WHERE I'M FROM, WE HAVE SO MANY -- SO MANY LEADERS, AND THEY DON'T GET A A CHANCE TO GET THAT EDUCATION, THAT SAME EDUCATION MAYBE SOMEBODY GETS IN SCARSDALE OR SOMETHING. AND SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAMPUS LOOKED LIKE SCARSDALE AND FELT LIKE HARLEM, AND THE EDUCATION WAS TOP-NOTCH AND IT'S A CURRICULUM THAT REALLY BUILDS THE FUTURE LEADERS OF TOMORROW. IT'S CALLED CAPITAL PREP, THE SCHOOL IS FREE FOR THE KIDS THAT GET TO GO THERE. IT'S A CHARTER SCHOOL AND LAUNCHING THIS YEAR, AND IT'S GRADES 6-7, AND WE'RE GOING TO CONSTANTLY GROW, SO WE'RE NEED YOUR SUPPORT FOR CAPITAL PREP IN HARLEM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SO HAPPY THAT'S TAKING OFF. THAT'S GREAT. GO TO SCHOOL. GO TO SCHOOL, KIDS! AND THEN, I QUICKLY WANT TO MENTION, MAY 20th AT BARCLAYS IN BROOKLYN.
