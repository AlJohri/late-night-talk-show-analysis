I'D TAKE A BULLET FOR HER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH I DON'T WANT TELL HER, BUT I'M LIKE, "GAGA, IF YOU NEED THAT."
Jimmy: SHE'S THE COOLEST.
BUT WE HAD, LIKE, CROSSED PATHS SO MANY TIMES AND I HAD NEVER GOTTEN TO INTRODUCE MYSELF. SO, THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME WHERE I WAS LIKE, "I'M DOING IT. I'M GOING UP, I'M SAYING HI." AND I WAS LIE, "HI, I'M TYLER OAKLEY." AND SHE GOES, "I'VE SEEN YOU. YOU'RE ON BILLBOARDS." AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, NO!"
Jimmy: YOU'RE ON BILLBOARDS. LIKE REALLY? AND YOU JUST GET NERVOUS.
YEAH. SO THAT WAS JUST LIKE --
Jimmy: EMBARRASSING?
UNEXPECTED.
NOT EMBARRASSING, BUT JUST, LIKE, MY QUEEN KNOWS WHO I AM. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ALL. THAT'S I NEED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "MY QUEEN KNOWS WHO I AM." THAT'S A GREAT -- THAT'S TRENDING NOW ON TWITTER. "MY QUEEN KNOWS WHO I AM" IS A A GREAT THING. IT'S FROM "GAME OF THRONES."
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: BUT HERE YOU'RE DOING THIS, NOW. SO THEN THIS LEADS TO NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS, WHICH IS "THE AMAZING RACE."
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHICH IS JUST -- I -- NO SPOILERS. DON'T TELL ME.
I WON'T TELL YOU ANYTHING.
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT I'M LOOKING AT YOUR EYES.
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO.
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I CAN SEE --
I'M GONNA COMMUNICATE IT TO YOU.
Jimmy: YEAH, I CAN KIND OF SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU'RE GONNA GO -- OKAY, YOU'RE ALMOST THE WINNER, BUT SOMETHING GOES WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHO KNOWS? TUNE IN TONIGHT.
Jimmy: WHO KNOWS, YEAH. EXACTLY. BUT THIS IS A BIG DEAL. THIS IS ALL, LIKE, SOCIAL MEDIA PEOPLE ON THIS ONE.
YEAH! SO, IT'S ALL INTERNET PEOPLE.
Jimmy: GAMERS.
YEAH, THERE'S, LIKE, PEOPLE THAT ARE FROM BEHIND THE SCENES, PEOPLE THAT ARE OLDER, YOUNGER, VIRAL VIDEOS FULL TIME. SO A LOT OF JUST, LIKE, INTERNET PEOPLE. BUT ONCE YOU GET ON THE RACE, WE ALL COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT WHAT WE DID. IT'S JUST LIKE, YOU GET IN THERE, YOU COMPLETELY FORGET THAT YOU'RE TURNING IN YOUR PHONE.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, YOU'RE UNPLUGGED. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED --
NO PHONE. SO, THE FIRST DAY WAS LIKE --
Jimmy: DID YOU FREAK OUT?
I FELT LIKE I WAS MISSING A A LIMB. DAY TWO, I WAS LIKE, "THIS IS HEAVEN. I'M AM, LIKE, LIVING MY DREAM."
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT'S NICE.
Jimmy: BUT DID YOU MISS OUT ON ANY POP CULTURE MOMENTS? WHERE YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, I GOT TO TWEET!"
NOTHING TOO BAD LIKE THAT. BUT THE ONLY THING WAS AT THE TIME WHEN WE FILMED, IT WAS BACK IN NOVEMBER AND THE ADELE ALBUM CAME OUT. SO, I WAS LIKE -- I JUST NEEDED TO KNOW IF IT WAS GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I WAS -- NO MATTER WHERE I WAS IN THE WORLD, I WAS ASKING THE LOCALS NOT FOR HELP OR DIRECTIONS, I WAS LIKE, "HAVE YOU HEARD THE ADELE ALBUM?" [ LAUGHTER ] PRIORITIES.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. MY QUEEN KNOWS WHO I AM. ARE YOU ON SNAPCHAT AS WELL?
I AM. IS THIS YOUR PICKUP LINE? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S WORKING. IT'S WORKING.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. I USE THAT ON EVERYBODY. THAT'S HOW I MET MY WIFE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
LOVE IS BEAUTIFUL.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT I WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO DO -- THEY HAVE A NEW FEATURE ON HERE CALLED FACE SWAP.

Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THIS FEELS VERY INTIMATE. BUT, OKAY.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS GOOD. WE JUST GOTTA -- WE GOT TO GET IN THERE. YEAH. RECOGNIZING.
OH, GOD.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT RECOGNIZING MY FACE AS A HUMAN.
YOU WANT ME TO TRY?
Jimmy: YEAH. CAN YOU DO IT?
I'M A SOCIAL MEDIA MOGUL. OH. DID YOU SEE THAT?
Jimmy: YEAH.
OH, I DON'T LIKE THIS ONE BIT.
Jimmy: I KNOW, BUT YOU GOT TO PRESS THE THING BUTTON.
DO I? YOU PUSH THE BUTTON. TEAM WORK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
