THEY ARE THE NICEST MAN. I HAD SO MUCH FUN. ADAM'S AWESOME, HIM AND HIS WIFE.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, YEAH.
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. I WOULD DO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
Jimmy: IT'S ALMOST LIKE SUMMER CAMP, RIGHT?
IT IS SUMMER CAMP. WE DID IT IN SAVANNAH. AND HE PUTS ON A CAMP FOR EVERYBODY'S KIDS.
Jimmy: OH, HE ACTUALLY DOES?
AND IT'S, LIKE, TOP LEVEL SUMMER CAMP.
Jimmy: DOES HE REALLY?
THERE IS TUMBLING CLASS AND, LIKE, FIELD TRIPS. IT'S REALLY -- HE'S SO THOUGHTFUL.
Jimmy: HE'S JUST A GOOD DUDE.
I WOULD DO IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT YOU CAN DO THAT.
DO IT OVER AND OVER FOR DAYS.
Jimmy: AND ACTION -- THAT'S AN ACTION-COMEDY. BUT THEN YOU GO AND DO "WARCRAFT", WHICH I HAVE SPENT MANY HOURS PLAYING.
OH, NO WAY.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I TRIED TO FIGURE IT OUT.
OH, PLEASE. TELL ME, WERE YOU, LIKE, A A BLOOD ELF -- IS THAT EVEN A REAL CHARACTER?
Jimmy: NO. BUT I STARTED OFF -- MY NAME WAS --
YOU DIDN'T DO IT.
Jimmy: I DID, YEAH. I DID BECAUSE I -- WHAT WAS MY NAME, AGAIN? "D'VARNON" WAS MY NAME.
REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH.
OKAY.
Jimmy: BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID, "MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A A CANDYBAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? I GOT ADVICE FROM SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY PLAYED IT, AND I GO -- I COULDN'T THINK OF A NAME. AND I THOUGHT OF MAYBE BAR NONE? IS THAT A CANDY?
YEAH, I THINK THAT IS A A CANDY.
Jimmy: SO I DID "BAR NONE." THEN I GO, "D'VARNON." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS "D'VARNON" AND I SPENT MONTHS AND MONTHS JUST GETTING KILLED BY OTHER PEOPLE, BUT I ENJOYED IT. AS I PLAYED THE GAME AND IT WAS -- FELECIA DAY, WHO GAME ME THE PROPS ON THAT. JUST A SHOUT OUT TO HER. BUT WE PLAYED ALL THE TIME. AND THEN I JUST GO, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING." BUT THEN THIS MOVIE COMES OUT AND GO, OKAY, "WARCRAFT" -- IT'S BIGGER THAN BIG, YOU GUYS. CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS. I JUST HEARD IN CHINA, BIGGEST NON-WEEKEND OPENING, MADE $46 MILLION IN ONE DAY.

Jimmy: AND DID YOU LEARN HOW TO --
I DIDN'T HAVE MANY FRIENDS.
Jimmy: DID YOU LEARN HOW TO SPEAK ORC?
I DID. AND THEY TOOK IT REALLY SERIOUSLY. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT, MAYBE I COULD JUST GO OUT THERE AND RIFF. AND THEY'RE LIKE, "NO, YOU NEED A BATTLE COACH."
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU GO OUT THERE AND RIFF?
I DON'T KNOW. [ GRUNTING ] LIKE, NO ONE WOULD KNOW. THEY'RE LIKE, "NO, WE HAVE AN ACTUAL DIALECT."
Jimmy: A LANGUAGE.
AND ALL THE WORDS MEAN SOMETHING.
Jimmy: AND ALSO, LET ME JUST SHOW THIS PICTURE OF YOU. THIS IS YOU FROM THE MOVIE. LOOK AT THIS.

Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANT A A DRIBBLING ORC. YOU'RE LIKE -- [ GRUNTING ] [ LAUGHTER ]
NOT CUTE. IT'S LIKE, ENOUGH ALREADY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
NO, BUT I WOULD, LIKE, CLEAN THE HOUSE, PLAY WITH JULIAN. I MUST HAVE LOOKED CRAZY TO OTHER PEOPLE. I CAN'T IMAGINE. BUT YOU HAVE GET IT TO BE GOOD.
Jimmy: YOU JUST HAVE TO DO THE ACTOR'S NORMAL STUFF, LIKE, GO PICK YOUR -- GO IN THE STORE AND GO -- [ GRUNTING ] "HI, EVERYBODY!"

SUP?
WHAT'S UP?
HOW YOU GUYS DOIN'? YOU GOOD? [ CHEERS ]
GOOD. GOOD.
OUR FATHER JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON RECENTLY. IT WAS LIKE TEN YEARS AGO.
YEAH.
AND IT'S BEEN TERRIBLE. 'CAUSE ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS FATHER/SON STUFF.
AND IT WOULDN'T BE SO BAD, BUT HE'S SUPER ARROGANT. LIKE TWO WEEKS AGO WE WERE PLAYING BASKETBALL AND MID WAY THROUGH, HE WAS LIKE, "YO, MAN, IF I WAS 15 INCHES TALLER I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE NBA." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE WE'RE LIKE, "NO, DUDE, YOU'D JUST BE A TALLER CRIMINAL." [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT IT GOT US TO PONDERING. YOU THINK NBA PLAYERS DO THE SAME THING IN REVERSE? LIKE DO THEY TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THEY WOULD DO IF THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT SHORTER? [ LAUGHTER ]
LIKE LeBRON JAMES AND KEVIN LOVE CHILLIN' AT CHUCK E. CHEESE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND LeBRON JAMES IS LIKE, "YO, MAN, IF I WAS 15 INCHES SHORTER, I'D KILL MYSELF." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE USED TO LOVE WATCHING THE NBA, BUT NOW IT'S LIKE KIND OF RUINED BECAUSE OF STATS.
OH, YEAH THE ADVANCED STATS ARE KILLING THE GAME, MAN. DESTROYING THE GAME.
I DON'T KNOW IF Y'ALL KNOW THESE STATS, MAN, BUT THERE'S THIS ONE STAT WE SAW AND IT SAID EVERY TIME STEPH CURRY SHOOTS 40% FROM THE THREE POINT LINE, A BLACK MAN GETS ARRESTED. [ LAUGHTER ]
TERRIFYING.
IT SCARED US, MAN.
IT WAS TERRIFYING.
IT SCARED US. [ LAUGHTER ] WE DID SOME MORE RESEARCH. WE READ IN THE ATLANTIC, ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE BLACK DUDES GET ARRESTED BEFORE THEY TURN 31. WE JUST TURNED 30. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S GETTING CLOSE.
MM-HMM. [ LAUGHTER ]
FORTUNATELY ENOUGH WE GOT A A YOUNGER BROTHER THAT JUST TURNED 18.
YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THAT DUDE ARRESTED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, IT'S EITHER HIM OR US.
THAT'S RIGHT.
TERRIFIED OF GETTING ARRESTED. ALSO TERRIFIED OF THE POLICE.
OH, MAN, THE POLICE ARE TOO AGGRESSIVE. TOO -- WE HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH THEM A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. WE WERE CHILLIN' AT CHUCK E. CHEESE WALKING AWAY.
THAT'S RIGHT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN A COP CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND PULLED A GUN OUT ON US.
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND IT GOT REAL STRANGE. HE HAD THE GUN ON ME AND THEN HE POINTED AT HIM, THEN HE POINTED AT ME AND THEN HE POINTED HIM AND THEN HE STOPPED.
AND WE GOT MAD NERVOUS, YO. WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GET ARRESTED BECAUSE STEPH CURRY SHOT 40% THAT NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE GOT NERVOUS.
GOT NERVOUS.
BUT IT WAS COOL. HE DIDN'T ARREST US. HE JUST WANTED A SELFIE.
AND WE TOOK IT BECAUSE HE HAD A GUN.
MM-HMM. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN HE GOT ON HIS HORSE AND HE FLEW AWAY.
YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
BUT THAT EXPERIENCE CHANGED OUR PERSPECTIVE ON GUNS. NOW WE'RE ANTI-GUN ACTIVISTS.
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.
AND ANY TIME WE SEE SOMEONE WHO MAKES A DEFENSE OF GUNS WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
THAT'S RIGHT. SO WHEN WE SAW TRUMP TALKIN' TO THE NRA ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING MORE GUNS. WE SAID, "WE GOTTA WRITE LETTER."
WE GOTTA WRITE HIM A LETTER.
SO, WE'RE GONNA SHARE THAT LETTER WITH Y'ALL TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
DEAR DONALD TRUMP. WHAT'S GOOD? [ LAUGHTER ] WHILE CHILLIN' AT CHUCK E. CHEESE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE SAW YOUR ORANGE FACE MAKIN' A DEFENSE OF GUNS. YOU ARGUE THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE MORE GUNS THEY'LL BE SAFER. THAT LOGIC IS FLAWED. HERE'S WHY. 20th CENTURY POET BIGGIE SMALLS ONCE SAID -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I GOT SEVEN MAC-11s, ABOUT EIGHT .38s, NINE 9s, TEN MAC-10s, THE GUNS NEVER END. NOW THAT'S ABOUT 34 TO AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF GUNS FOR ONE RAPPER. AND HE STILL GOT SHOT.
THAT'S RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU, GUYS.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
