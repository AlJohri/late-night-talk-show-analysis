Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU, EVERYONE. HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU MADE IT! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IT'S A FUN SHOW TONIGHT, MAN. BUT FIRST, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, IT IS TRUMP, AND A A NEW REPORT FINDS THAT PROTECTING DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY IS COSTING NEW YORK CITY TAXPAYERS OVER $1 MILLION A A DAY. [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] AND TRUMP WAS LIKE, "THANK GOD I'M NOT A TAXPAYER." I MEAN THAT IS -- WOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] RIGHT NOW, THE FOCUS IS ON WHO TRUMP WILL APPOINT TO HIS CABINET. IN FACT, C-SPAN AIRED A LIVE FEED OF THE ELEVATORS AT TRUMP TOWER THAT CAPTURED POTENTIAL CABINET MEMBERS GOING UP TO MEET DONALD TRUMP. DID YOU SEE THAT? IT EVEN CAUGHT THE MOMENT TED CRUZ WAS APPROACHING THE ELEVATOR AND EVERYONE INSIDE FRANTICALLY HIT THE "DOOR CLOSE" BUTTON. THEY'RE LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SORRY, SORRY. GET THE NEXT ONE! AND THIS IS KIND OF EMBARRASSING. KANSAS SECRETARY OF STATE, KRIS KOBACH, WHO DONALD TRUMP IS CONSIDERING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WAS PHOTOGRAPHED WITH HIS NOTES THAT REVEALED HIS DEPORTATION PLANS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE DIDN'T DO ANY -- THIS IS REAL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PHOTO. CAN WE ZOOM IN THERE? THAT'S REAL. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] TRUMP WAS LIKE, "MY FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS AS PRESIDENT IS TO BY THIS DUMMY A FOLDER." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT -- EVEN RUSSIAN HACKERS ARE LIKE, "COME ON, IT'S TOO EASY. THIS IS LIKE, I CAN READ EVERYTHING." KOBACH SEEMS LIKE THE TYPE OF GUY WHO SAYS HIS ATM NUMBER OUT LOUD AS HE PUNCHES IT IN. 7-6-9-3, DONE. AND NOW I GET MONEY. THAT'S MY MONEY CODE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND GET THIS, TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER, KELLYANNE CONWAY, WAS BEING INTERVIEWED YESTERDAY AND SHE SAYS THAT SHE'S VERY CONFIDENT THAT TRUMP ISN'T BREAKING ANY LAWS DURING HIS TRANSITION. AND AMERICANS WERE LIKE, "UH WE WEREN'T EVEN SUSPICIOUS UNTIL YOU SAID THAT." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "WHY? WHAT DID HE DO?" [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS JUST PRETTY COOL. I READ THAT GOOGLE JUST ADDED A A NEW UPDATE FEATURE THAT SHOWS YOU THE MOST POPULAR TIMES FOR STORES AND RESTAURANTS. YEAH. IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO LOOK UP PLACES, SEE WHAT TIMES THEY'RE THE BUSIEST. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU GOOGLED IKEA, THE MOST POPULAR TIME IS WHEN THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING WELL IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP AND YOU'RE LONG OVERDUE FOR A A FIGHT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I LIKE THE CLUEGIN HORGAN. YOU LIKE THAT? [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT'S UGLY.
Jimmy: NEXT UP IS YOU GOOGLE HOT TOPIC, THE MOST POPULAR TIME IS, FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS IN SEVENTH GRADE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] VERY POPULAR TIME.
Steve: WHAT A TIME. A VERY SMALL WINDOW. VERY SMALL WINDOW.
Jimmy: FINALLY, IF YOU GOOGLE THE MANNEQUIN CHALLENGE, THE MOST POPULAR TIME IS THREE WEEKS AGO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO DO IT, DO IT THREE WEEKS AGO. ACTUALLY, I SAW THAT PRISONERS IN ALABAMA POSTED A VIDEO OF THEM DOING THE MANNEQUIN CHALLENGE, WHICH IS ILLEGAL, BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE CELL PHONES. WHEN THEY FOUND OUT, THE GUARDS BURST IN AND YELLED, "UH, UNFREEZE!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHATEVER. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. STOP DOING THAT. GIVE ME YOUR PHONE. WHATEVER. [ APPLAUSE ] I READ THAT LOWE'S HARDWARE STORE JUST UNVEILED A NEW BILINGUAL ROBOT THAT ROLLS AROUND TO HELP YOU FIND THINGS IN THE STORE. YEAH, SO DEFINITELY GET TO LOWE'S IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A A ROBOT SAY, "I DON'T ACTUALLY WORK IN THIS DEPARTMENT." NO TRABAJO -- [ APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, THANKSGIVING IS JUST A COUPLE DAYS AWAY. YOU GUYS READY FOR THANKSGIVING? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE THANKSGIVING. I SAW THAT VICTORIA'S SECRET WILL OPEN AT 5:00 P.M. ON THANKSGIVING AND STAY OPEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH BLACK FRIDAY. BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING PEOPLE WANT TO DO IT'S STUFF THEIR FACES ALL DAY THEN TRY ON SOME LINGERIE. THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD. [ APPLAUSE ] AND THIS IS NICE, I SAW THAT THE CREW AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WILL GET A A THANKSGIVING MEAL THAT INCLUDES SLICED TURKEY, CANDIED YAMS, AND APRICOT COBBLER. THEY'RE ALSO THE ONLY AMERICANS BRAVE ENOUGH TO GET ON A SCALE AFTER DINNER. YEP, STILL ZERO POUNDS. I DON'T KNOW HOW I KEEP IT SO TRIM -- SLIM. [ APPLAUSE ] AND AS ALWAYS, I SAW THAT MANY AMERICANS ARE PLANNING TO DEEP FRY THEIR TURKEYS THIS YEAR. BUT TO SAVE MYSELF SOME TIME, I JUST STUFFED MY TURKEY WITH A A SAMSUNG GALAXY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GET THE SAME -- IT'S GREAT. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

GUITAR BATTLE AT DAWN TO RESTORE MY HONOR FOR BEING RANKED THIRD.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT.
I DIDN'T EITHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I KNOW YOU PLAY -- YOU PLAY MUSIC, SO YOU -- YOU'RE IN A BAND.
YES, YES.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A NEW SONG THAT JUST CAME OUT TODAY OR DOES IT COME OUT TOMORROW?
TOMORROW. HA HA SONG.
Jimmy: HA HA SONG RIGHT THERE CALLED SMITHS RADIO, AND YOU CAN GET THIS ON ITUNES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
I AM TOO.
Jimmy: WHAT WOULD LUKE THINK OF THE SONG? WOULD HE LIKE IT?
I THINK, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A SCENE WHERE HE SMASHED A WALL WITH JACK. THAT'S YOUR ROOM. AND THEY PLAYED THIS REALLY GREAT PUNK SONG.
Jimmy: YES, I REMEMBER THAT.
SO YEAH, I THINK HE WOULD LIKE THE SONG.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD. YEAH, YEAH.
I THINK HE'D LOVE THE SONG ACTUALLY.
Jimmy: I'VE BEEN SO GETTING INTO IT. IS IT ODD THAT I'M GETTING INTO IT THIS LATE?
NO, YOU CAN COME TO IT WHENEVER YOU LIKE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: COME TO IT WHENEVER YOU LIKE.
GIVING YOU PERMISSION.
Jimmy: YEAH. DID YOU KNOW OR HAVE ANY IDEA THAT YOU GUYS WOULD ALL BE COMING BACK AND REPRISING YOUR ROLES?
I'VE BEEN LOBBYING FOR IT FOR YEARS, YOU KNOW, THE FANS SORT OF SEE IT AS A RELIGION. IT'S NOT JUST A SHOW TO THEM.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND YOU CAUGHT THE FEVER NOW.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE COMFORT FOOD. SO GREAT. I LOOK FORWARD TO IT EVERY NIGHT. I DON'T WANT IT TO END.
WE KNEW DURING THE ORIGINAL RUN HOW THE FANS WERE REACTING TO IT, SO IT'S NOT REALLY A A SURPRISE BUT YEAH, IT WAS -- AT ATEX ABOUT A YEAR AGO, THE ATEX FESTIVAL, WE KNEW THAT IT WAS SOMETHING REAL BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE KIND OF FELT LIKE ROCK STARS WHEN WE GOT THERE. THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE THERE TRYING TO GET IN THE VENUE AND THEY JUST WANTED A GLIMPSE.
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT EXCITING?
YEAH.
Jimmy: I MEAN --
IT WAS BONKERS.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE ON "HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU WERE BONNIE. THERE'S AN ARGUMENT IN THE HOUSE, LIKE, WHO WAS YOUR FAVORITE CHARACTER, IS IT PARIS OR BONNIE? BUT YOU'RE TWO OUT OF TWO IN OUR HOUSE. MY WIFE IS LIKE, OH MY GOD, SHE DESERVES AN EMMY. SHE IS THE BEST ACTOR. OH, MY GOSH. SO, CONGRATS ON THAT. [ APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: DO YOU GO -- HEY, I'D LOVE TO DO THIS BUT I GOT THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHICH CHARACTER WOULD CONFUSE PEOPLE.
"GILMORE GIRLS" HAS BEEN SORT OF A PAST TENSE THING UNTIL NOW, AND WHEN WE WENT TO DO THE REVIVAL, WE HAD WRAPPED OUR SECOND SEASON OF "HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER" SO IT GOT TO -- IT WAS LOVELY TO BE ABLE TO DO ONE THING, YOU KNOW. WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT ALL AT THE SAME TIME. AND YEAH, THEY KIND OF EXIST SEPARATELY. BUT YES, IT WAS BIZARRE TO GO BACK.
Jimmy: IT WAS WEIRD TO GO BACK?
YEAH.
SUPER WEIRD.
Jimmy: SEAN, DID BRINGING KIRK BACK? DID YOU GO, YEAH, NO.
IT'S JUST WEIRD. YEAH, NO, I MEAN, THE WHOLE THING IS CRAZY. IT FEELS LIKE THE SHOW IS MORE POPULAR NOW THAN IT EVER WAS, YOU KNOW, EVEN WHEN IT WAS ON THE AIR. SO TO HEAR, YOU KNOW, FANS ARE SO EXCITED FOR IT, FOR A SHOW THAT WE DID, YOU KNOW, WE STARTED DOING IT 15 YEARS AGO OR WHATEVER, IT'S CRAZY.
Jimmy: AND YOU'VE GOT A GOOD RIDE OF YOUR CHARACTER. WHAT A FUN CHARACTER. I MEAN, WAS THAT -- KIRK IS JUST, EVERY TIME YOU COME ON, YOU KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK.
YOU KNOW, I CAME ON AS THE DSL INSTALLER IN THE FIRST EPISODE I DID. I WAS JUST SUPPOSED TO BE A A ONE-DAY JOB, YOU KNOW? BACK IN 2000. AND YOU KNOW, HERE I AM NOW.
Jimmy: BUT YOU CHOSE THIS CHARACTER, HE'S JUST SO OUT THERE AND WEIRD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND I LOVED IT. BUT ALL THREE OF YOU, HOME RUNS. I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE, I MEAN AFTER HOW MANY SEASONS? WAS IT SEVEN SEASONS?
YEAH.
SEVEN.
Jimmy: YOU REALLY GOT TO WORK AS AN ACTOR. WHAT AN ARC. I MEAN, YOU GOT TO KNOW THESE GUYS. I'M LIKE, IT'S CRAZY. THAT'S HOW GREAT TELEVISION IS, I THINK. BECAUSE MOVIES ARE GREAT AS WELL, BUT THEY'RE TWO HOURS, YOU GET IN, YOU KNOW THE CHARACTER, YOU GET OUT. A SHOW IS -- I MEAN, I GOT 60 HOURS LEFT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M ALREADY -- I'M ALREADY THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY THROUGH. SO, I MEAN, DID YOU GET -- AS SOON AS YOU HIT THE SET DO, YOU GO, OH, I KNOW WHAT LUKE IS ALL ABOUT? YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I DID. I PUT THE HAT ON, AND I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE BIG SHINING MOMENT THAT THE CHARACTER WOULD COME BACK. IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS. I HAD A SON. YOU KNOW, I WAS A DIFFERENT GUY. I WAS MORE LAID BACK, I WAS HAPPIER. YOU KNOW, I HAD THIS LITTLE BOY RUNNING AROUND.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I GOT ON SET AND GOT INTO THE DINER AND STARTED REHEARSING A SCENE, AMY WAS DIRECTING AND I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING. I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THE GUY AT ALL. SO I ASKED PERMISSION TO GO TAKE A WALK AROUND STARS HOLLOW AND WHEN I GOT TO THE GAZEBO, I SAT DOWN AND, YOU KNOW, I STARTED FEELING LIKE THE GUY AGAIN. AND I WENT BACK IN.
Jimmy: OH MY GOD.
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET FIRED.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T GET FIRED. YOU'RE LUKE. YOU FIRE THEM. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT'S A TELEPHONE, GET OUT OF HERE.
I WAS SO BAD IN REHEARSAL THAT I THOUGHT, I NEED TO TAKE A WALK. I MIGHT AS WELL GO WALK BACK TO MY TRAILER AND TAKE OFF.
Jimmy: NO WAY. AMY SHERMAN PALADINO, SHE HAD THIS IDEA, IT'S DAY IN THE LIFE, IT'S FOUR SEASONS, IS WHAT I'M ASSUMING. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW TOO MUCH 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL ANYTHING. BUT I KNOW THAT IT DOES END WITH THE FOUR WORDS, RIGHT, THAT SHE PLANNED ON IT ALWAYS ENDING?
YES, I BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE FOUR WORDS ARE?
I DO.
Jimmy: YOU DO?
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW?
NO, I WANT TO WATCH IT WITH THE FANS.
Jimmy: MAYBE IT'S "I DON'T WANT TO KNOW." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WELL, IT COULD BE THAT.
Jimmy: IT'S TRICKY.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT'S NOT.
Jimmy: WHAT'S THAT?
MAYBE IT'S "KIRK IS YOUR OVERLORD." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I COULD SEE THAT.
MY IDEA TO AMY WAS "DROP THE GUN, KIRK," AND SHE REJECTED IT.
Jimmy: DROP THE GUN, KIRK. NO. BUT IT'S A MUCH DEEPER, RIGHT?
IT'S MORE PHILOSOPHICAL.
Jimmy: IT IS.
YOU HAD SOME BETTER IDEAS IN YOUR MONOLOGUE.
Jimmy: RIGHT? THAT STARS HOLLOW NEVER EXISTED. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE THIS WHOLE THING IS IN A SNOW GLOBE AND THAT'S THE WAY IT ENDS.
WHO'S GOING TO PAY MY MORTGAGE IN THAT CASE?
Jimmy: NO, EXACTLY. YEAH. I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO THINK IS IT A CAROL KING REFERENCE. IT'S VERY TRICKY THING. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT --
YEAH, IT'S BIGGER THAN ALL OF US.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT IS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S SIX WORDS. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS. IT COMES OUT FRIDAY, BUT I LOVE YOU GUYS. I LOVE YOU GUYS. I LOVE YOU GUYS. ON BEHALF OF ALL YOUR FANS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE REALLY HITTING A HOME RUN. YOU MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SO GOOD. JUST SUCH A GREAT JOB.
