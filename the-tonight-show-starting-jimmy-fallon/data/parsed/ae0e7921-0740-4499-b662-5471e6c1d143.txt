Jimmy: AS ONE SHOULD. [ LAUGHTER ]
AS ONE SHOULD. ANYWAY IT WAS SORT OF SETTING THE GROUND RULES FOR THE CHARACTERS AND THE RELATIONSHIP AND SO ON. THEN HALFWAY THROUGH THE SEASON SORT OF RESETTING THOSE GROUND RULES. WELL AT THE END OF THE SEASON EVERYTHING BLEW UP AND HALF THE CHARACTERS ARE LEFT IN REAL DISARRAY BY THE END OF THE FIRST SEASON. SO THE SECOND SEASON OF THE SHOW REALLY HAS SORT OF OPENED UP AND -- BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE NOW SORT OF STARTED TO BE FORMED AND SO ON AND CERTAIN THINGS FROM THE PAST ARE COMING IN, ALL OF THE STAKES HAVE JUST BEEN RAISED. I MEAN, AND WE'RE ON EPISODE FOUR RIGHT NOW, JUST ABOUT TO START FIVE AND JUST ALL THE STAKES HAVE BEEN RAISED.
