AT HIS RALLY ON SATURDAY, TRUMP SUGGESTED THERE WAS A TERROR ATTACK IN SWEDEN THAT DIDN'T REALLY HAPPEN. AND THEN THE SWEDISH EMBASSY ASKED THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR AN EXPLANATION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW THINGS ARE BAD WHEN THE COUNTY THAT MAKES IKEA INSTRUCTIONS IS TOTALLY CONFUSED. YOU GO -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT? WHAT DO I PUT IN THE WHAT? THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD, I NOTICED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DIDN'T WEAR A TIE TO HIS BIG RALLY IN ORLANDO ON SATURDAY. I GUESS IT WAS EITHER AT THE CLEANERS OR HE GOT TIRED OF TRIPPING OVER IT.
