Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- GWENETH PALTROW JOSH GAD MUSICAL GUEST, PANDA BEAR AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 194.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. FUN SHOW TONIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. BUT FIRST, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE WILL BEGIN FUND-RAISING FOR A POTENTIAL 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN BY THE END OF JANUARY. NO WORD ON WHAT HIS PLATFORM WILL BE. BUT IF I KNOW CHRISTIE, IT WILL BE REALLY STRONG. [ APPLAUSE ] REALLY STRONG -- REALLY STRONG PLATFORM.
Steve: A LOT OF SUPPORT.
Jimmy: AS MUCH AS YOU GET. HE HAS A LOT OF SUPPORT. ACTUALLY, CHRISTIE GAVE HIS FIFTH ANNUAL STATE OF THE STATE SPEECH YESTERDAY, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT LIKE HE WAS USING IT AS THE KICKOFF TO A POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. AND I CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE WOULD THINK THAT. BECAUSE REMEMBER, HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING ABOUT NEW JERSEY. WATCH.
I SAW IT ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO AND FELT IT IN THE SUBURBS OF MARYLAND. I HEARD IT FROM FARMERS IN KANSAS AND FROM TEACHERS IN COLORADO. I FELT IT FROM VETERANS IN MAINE AND FROM WORKERS IN ARKANSAS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PRETTY SURE NEW JERSEY IS THE ONLY STATE HE DID NOT MENTION. ANY MENTION AT ALL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I WENT TO KANSAS. EVEN THE GUYS THAT WROTE "KOKOMO," WERE LIKE ANY OTHER PLACES YOU WANT TO MENTION? ARUBA, JAMAICA. [ LAUGHTER ] DID YOU HEAR THIS? IT'S RUMORED THAT CHRIS CHRISTIE AND MITT ROMNEY ARE PLANNING TO MEET TO OVERCOME ANY LINGERING AWKWARDNESS FROM THE 2 2012 ELECTION. INCIDENTALLY, "LINGERING AWKWARDNESS" WAS ACTUALLY MITT ROMNEY'S SECRET SERVICE CODE NAME. [ LAUGHTER ] LINGERING AWKWARDNESS IS NOW IN THE -- GOOD EVENING, MR. ROMNEY, GOVERNOR ROMNEY. CHRIS CHRISTIE AND MITT ROMNEY HAVE HAD THEIR FAIR SHARE OF DIFFERENCES. APPARENTLY, THE TWO HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN YEARS AFTER THEIR LAST ARGUMENT OVER WHO'S ON FIRST. AND THEY JUST -- [ APPLAUSE ] NOW THEY FIGURED IT OUT AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO -- AND YESTERDAY SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL WAS ASKED WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT MITT ROMNEY JOINING AN ALREADY CROWDED FIELD OF POTENTIAL REPUBLICAN NOMINEES, AND HE SAID, "THE MORE THE MERRIER." ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT ALL McCONNELL HAD TO SAY ABOUT POTENTIAL CANDIDATES. TAKE A LOOK. WHEN TOLD DONALD TRUMP MIGHT RUN, HE SAID, "THE MORE THE HAIRIER." [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN HE WAS TOLD RICK SCOTT MIGHT RUN HE SAID, "THE MORE THE SCARIER." WHEN HE WAS TOLD RICK PERRY MIGHT RUN, HE SAID, "THE MORE THE PERRY-ER." I MEAN, HE'S REACHING THERE. BUT THEN FINALLY WHEN TOLD KIM KARDASHIAN MIGHT RUN HE SAID "THE MORE THE DERRIERE." [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S NOT EVEN IN POLITICS. WHAT IS HE DOING? JUST TELL HIM TO HANG UP THE PHONE. HANG UP THE PHONE. I FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A A ROUGH ELECTION. YESTERDAY RNC CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS SAID THAT ANY ACTIVITIES BETWEEN HILLARY AND BILL CLINTON ARE FAIR GAME IF SHE DECIDES TO RUN IN 2016. AND BILL SAID, "TRUST ME, THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY ACTIVITY BETWEEN US IN YEARS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "I MEAN, HAVE Y'ALL SEEN 'FROZEN'?" [ LAUGHTER ] "I DON'T WANT TO BUILD A A SNOWMAN." SOME TV NEWS, CBS IS COMING OUT WITH A NEW DRAMA CALLED "SUPERGIRL" WHICH WILL FOCUS ON SUPERMAN'S COUSIN. THEN CBS VIEWERS WERE LIKE, "YOU HAD ME ON SOUP. I LOVE SOUP SO MUCH. OH, MY HIP, OH, THE HEART. OH THE HEART -- I'M DEAD." [ APPLAUSE ] THIS KIND OF MADE ME LAUGH. A DOG IN SEATTLE IS MAKING NEWS AFTER COMMUTERS NOTICED THAT SHE'D BEEN RIDING THE BUS TO A A LOCAL PARK ALL BY HERSELF. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] EVERYONE SAYS THE DOG IS AMAZING. WHILE THE DOG WAS LIKE, "I'VE GOT TO FIND THAT BLIND GUY. I MEAN, I AM IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. THIS IS NOT GOOD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS AWFUL." ACCORDING TO THE MAGAZINE "U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT," THE BEST JOB IN AMERICA IS --
YOURS.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. YEAH. MINE. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU. YEAH, MINE IS. IT PRETTY MUCH IS THE BEST JOB. YEAH.
Steve: IT IS.
Jimmy: BUT NO. ACCORDING TO "U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT" -- [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU. THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD ONE. DO YOU WANT TO WRITE FOR OUR SHOW? I'M GOING TO GET YOUR AGENT'S NUMBER. THE BEST JOB IN AMERICA IS BEING A DENTIST. WHICH IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE A A DENTIST'S OFFICE IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE STILL READ "U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT." [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD. THERE'S A COMPANY IN AUSTRALIA THAT WILL ANONYMOUSLY SEND GLITTER TO YOUR ENEMIES. THEY'LL BE FINDING IT EVERYWHERE FOR WEEKS. SO IF YOU HAVE AN ENEMY AND YOU SEND THEM GLITTER, CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING ELTON JOHN. [ APPLAUSE ] ♪ HAVE YOU CLEANED THE RUG TONIGHT ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, A SNOWSTORM HAS BEEN HITTING NORTHERN IRELAND THIS WEEK, AND OF COURSE THE LOCAL WEATHER CHANNEL'S DOING ITS BEST TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THE KNOW.

Jimmy: HOW FUN IS THAT. AND YOU ALSO POSTED A PICTURE OF YOUR GRANDPA -- NO. THIS IS YOUR GRANDPA, RIGHT?
YEAH IT'S  --NO. IT'S MY BROTHER, JIMMY. YES, IT'S MY GRANDPA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SORRY.
YES, THAT'S MY GRANDFATHER. HE'S AMAZING. HE LOOKS LIKE POPEYE DOYLE FROM "FRENCH CONNECTION." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A LITTLE GENE HACKMAN. YEAH.
HE'S GOT A LITTLE GENE HACKMAN. "I'M GOING TO BEAT THE HELL OUT OF YOU."
Jimmy: HOW OLD IS HE?
95 YEARS OLD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. 95 YEARS OLD. HE'S GOT THIS THING WHERE EVERY TIME HE SEES MY DAUGHTER SHE SANG "YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE" ONCE TO HIM AND IT WAS SO SWEET AND NOW HE KIND OF FORGETS THAT SHE HAD JUST SUNG IT 42 SECONDS BEFORE 'CAUSE HE'S OLDER. SO SHE'LL FINISH IT AND THEN HE'LL GO, "I WANT YOU TO SING YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE TO ME." AND SHE WILL JUST LOOK AT ME WITH THE SADDEST EYES AND GO, "DADDY, I CAN'T -- I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN." [ LAUGHTER ] "I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN."
Jimmy: YOU DO WHAT DADDY DID ON IN "BOOK OF MORMON."
DADDY DID EIGHT SHOWS A A WEEK, AVA! YOU CAN DO IT FOR AN OLD MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] OR DADDY'S GOING TO TAKE MORE PICTURES IN BETWEEN LADIES' LEGS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT GETTING A A CAPRI SUN IF YOU DON'T DO IT.
THE MILK'S GOING AWAY! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO MORE BA-BA. SO I SEE GRAMPA -- WHAT'S GRANDPA'S NAME?
GRANDPA'S NAME IS JOSEPH. AND GRANDPA'S A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE LOVE YOU, GRANDPA.
HE'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: WE LOVE YOU, GRANDPA.
HE DOESN'T WATCH YOUR SHOW. HE WON'T SEE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OF COURSE HE DOES.
WELL, HE CAN'T HEAR IT. BUT HE WATCHES IT. HE WATCHES RERUNS ACTUALLY.
Jimmy: BECAUSE HE CAN'T HEAR DOESN'T MEAN HE CAN'T WATCH?
NO. HE ONLY WATCHES CARSON. HE THINKS CARSON'S STILL ON THE AIR. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CARSON IS STILL ON THE AIR. HE HOST'S "THE VOICE."
DOES HE?
Jimmy: THAT'S CARSON DALY. IS THAT WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH, THANK YOU. THIS IS THE OTHER ONE.
THIS IS AMAZING. THIS IS MY BROTHER --
Jimmy: I'M MEETING MY WHOLE FAILY.
WHY ARE YOU GOING THROUGH MY PHOTO ALBUM? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M LIVING VICARIOUSLY THROUGH YOU.
IT'S SO WEIRD. GET YOUR OWN FAMILY PICTURES DUDE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO. IT'S SO MUCH EASIER, MORE FUN. BUT HERE'S A PICTURE YOU POSTED.
THAT'S ME CIRCA 1987. MY BROTHER, WHO LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE COBRA KAI LECTURING ME. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT HE WOULD DO IS HE WOULD LECTURE ME. AROUND THIS TIME I WAS PROBABLY NOT DOING WELL IN SCHOOL. I WAS GWYNETH PALTROWING IT. I WOULD SIT ON THE STEPS OF MUSEUMS AT NIGHT. RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME. LEAVING LETTERS TO MY PARENTS. WITH MY MUSTACHE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
I LOVE GWYNETH.
Jimmy: SHE'S A REBEL.
SHE'S A REBEL. I LOVE THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW SHE SAID MUSTACHE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO HE'S LECTURING ME AND HE USED TO SAY TO ME ALL THE TIME, IF YOU DON'T CLEAN UP YOUR ACT, YOU'RE GOING TO END UP PUTTING PIMENTOS IN OLIVES. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS HIS THREAT TO ME. SO NOW EVERY TIME I DRINK A A MARTINI, I'M LIKE, OH, YEAH? WHO'S BOSS NOW BITCH? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LOOK HOW I DID, BRO.
YEAH, LOOK WHAT I DID, COBRA KAI.
Jimmy: DID PRETTY GOOD COBRA KAI. I LOVE THAT MOVIE. SPEAKING OF LOVING THAT MOVIE, "THE WEDDING RINGER." IT'S SO FUN.
YEAH. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU AND KEVIN HART HAVE A GREAT CHEMISTRY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S A GREAT PREMISE. THERE ARE SOME FUNNY CAMEOS IN THERE TOO THAT YOU ARE GOING TO ENJOY. BUT GOSH, IT MADE ME LAUGH. IT WAS A GREAT PREMISE. I THINK THAT IF THIS MOVIE -- WHEN THIS MOVIE TAKES OFF IT WILL BE THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE THIS WEEK. JUST GUESSING. IT SHOULD EXIST AS A JOB, AN OCCUPATION.
YEAH. KEVIN HART PLAYS A BEST MAN FOR HIRE. AND I HAVE A FEELING -- THAT JOB EXISTS. IT'S CALLED PROSTITUTION. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO. WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
IT'S PEOPLE FOR HIRE.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE SEQUEL.
THAT'S THE SEQUEL.
Jimmy: IF YOU DON'T HAVE A A BUDDY, YOU DON'T HAVE A A FRIEND --
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FRIEND TO HIRE FOR A WEDDING, AND A A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T --
Jimmy: NOPE. YOU CAN HIRE THIS GUY AND ESSENTIALLY HE'LL GIVE YOU A A PACKAGE. AND IN THIS CASE HE GIVES ME A A PACKAGE CALLED THE "GOLDEN TUX", WHICH IS SEVEN GROOMSMEN AND A BEST MAN. AND THEY'RE THE WORST POSSIBLE PEOPLE YOU COULD IMAGINE HIRING. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DO NOT DO A GOOD JOB.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND CHAOS ENSUES. AND THE MOVIE IS REALLY -- IT IS SO FUNNY.
Jimmy: BUT ACTUALLY IT IS GOOD. IT DOES HAVE HEART. HE DOES GIVE THESE AMAZING SPEECHES.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND YOU GO OH, MY GOD, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A A FRIEND LIKE THAT.
HE'S UNBELIEVABLE IN THIS MOVIE. I MEAN, KEVIN'S UNBELIEVABLE. I STEAL THE FILM. BUT KEVIN IS -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO. NO. JOSH --
WHAT? WAIT, WHAT HAPPENED? WHY DO YOU HAVE NO PULSE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M IN YOUR IMAGINATION. THIS SHOW DOESN'T EXIST JOSH.
THE WEIRDEST -- WAIT, WHAT IS THIS CARSON DALY NIGHTMARE?
Jimmy: I'M NOT CARSON DALY. BUT IT IS FUN AND IT'S GOOD. I WANT EVERYONE TO GO SEE IT. EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FRIEND TO GO SEE IT, THEY ARE FOR HIRE. YOU CAN HIRE THEM TO COME, WATCH THE MOVIE WITH YOU.
ABSOULUTELY, YEAH.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW A A CLIP. DO YOU KNOW WHAT CLIP WE ARE GOING TO SHOW?
YES I DO, THIS IS A CLIP.
Jimmy: YOU'RE JOSH GAD AND KEVIN HART --

YES, THANK YOU. WHY DID YOU ASK ME THE QUESTION JIMMY?
Jimmy: I WAS JOKING AROUND.
