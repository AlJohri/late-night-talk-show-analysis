IT'S THE MUSIC PLAYER AND A A MUSIC ECOSYSTEM. PONOMUSIC.COM, WHERE YOU CAN GET THE HIGHEST RES FILES AVAILABLE THAT WE GET FROM THE RECORD COMPANIES. AND THIS PLAYER PLAYS THEM. AND IT'S JUST LIKE AN iPOD EXCEPT IT SOUNDS -- IT GOES UP.
Jimmy: I DID IT. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. [ APPLAUSE ] IT HAS A MINI SD CARD DOWN THERE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY ADD MORE MEMORY AND STUFF LIKE THAT DOWN HERE IN THE BOTTOM. I WAS PLAYING WITH IT TODAY AND I HAD JUST ANY HEADPHONES THAT WE FOUND IN THE OFFICE. AND I PLUGGED IN -- I WAS PLAYING "HARVEST." I HAD MY FRIEND SWITCH IT OUT AND SEE IF I COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN iPOD AND THIS. I COULD COMPLETELY TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE A MUSIC LOVER.
Jimmy: I DO.
YOU LOVE MUSIC.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT.
THAT'S WHAT PONO IS ABOUT, PEOPLE WHO LOVE MUSIC. IF YOU LOVE MUSIC AND YOU FEEL MUSIC LIKE THESE GUYS OVER HERE -- THEY'RE GOING TO HEAR IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE GOING TO HEAR IT.
Jimmy: IT'S WARM. IT ENVELOPES YOU AND YOU GO, "OH YEAH, I KNOW THAT THAT'S PONO RIGHT THERE." AND THEN YOU WENT BACK AND THEY TRIED TO TRICK ME AND DIDN'T SWITCH IT. I GO, "NO, YOU'RE STILL ON THE iPOD." I COULD TOTALLY FEEL THE DIFFERENCE. CLOSEST THING TO VINYL.
THAT'S GOOD. WELL, YOU KNOW, SOME FOLKS CAN'T HEAR THE DIFFERENCE. BUT THEY'RE NOT USUALLY MUSIC LOVERS OR PEOPLE TOTALLY INTO MUSIC. YOU KNOW, THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE MUSIC. NOT EVERYBODY LOVES MUSIC.
Jimmy: THEY LIKE IT.
SOME PEOPLE GO MUSIC IS WALLPAPER. IT'S THE BACKGROUND. IT'S WHAT WE HAVE. OTHER PEOPLE GO, "I WANT TO HEAR MUSIC. I LOVE MUSIC. I WANT TO TURN IT ON AND ROCK." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! TURN IT ON AND ROCK! AND YOU GO TO PONOMUSIC.FORCE.COM. THERE'S OVER TWO MILLION SONGS ON THIS THING. SO, CONGRATULATIONS. THIS STARTED AS A KICK STARTER, RIGHT?
YEAH. IT WAS KICK STARTER CAMPAIGN THAT GOT US GOING.
Jimmy: GOSH, CONGRATULATIONS. THIS IS THE COOLEST THING EVER.
YEAH, AND IT'S FUN. IT'S FUN TO DO IT. BECAUSE IT MAKES EVERYBODY'S RECORDS SOUND BETTER. EVERYBODY WHO EVER MADE A A RECORD, YOU KNOW, WE CAN -- IT IS A POTENTIAL TO MAKE IT SOUND AS GREAT AS IT CAN SOUND.
Jimmy: AND ALL THE ROOTS -- ALL THE ROOTS' ALBUMS ARE ON PONO.
YEAH, THEY ARE.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY WITH THE ROOTS TONIGHT.
YEAH, I'M GOING TO PLAY A A SONG WITH THE ROOTS.
Jimmy: WHAT SONG ARE YOU GOING TO DO TONIGHT? YOU'RE GOING TO DO "WHO'S GOING TO STAND UP"?
