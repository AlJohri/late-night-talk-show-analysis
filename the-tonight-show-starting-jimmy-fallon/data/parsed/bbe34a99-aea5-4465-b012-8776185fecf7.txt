WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT MYSELF? THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] WILL YOU JOIN US IN THE WRITERS' ROOM?
Danny: OH, SURE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU PITCH THIS SHOW TO NETFLIX, BECAUSE THAT'S A TRICKY IDEA.
A REALLY TRICKY IDEA. I THINK, YOU KNOW ZAL AND I CO-CREATED THE SHOW TOGETHER.
Jimmy: AND THAT'S YOUR WRITING PARTNER. RIGHT?
ZAL BATMANGLIJ, YES. WE MET IN COLLEGE AND WE CAME UP WITH A STORY BECAUSE WE JUST SIT IN A ROOM TOGETHER AND ACT STUFF OUT. SO WE THOUGHT THIS IS HOW YOU PITCH SOMETHING. SO WE WOULD GO INTO THE PITCH ROOM -- THERE WOULD BE A ROOM FULL OF EXECUTIVES AND WE'D JUST START -- STAND-UP AND WE'D PLAY ALL THE PARTS AND ANYTHING IN THE ROOM WAS FAIR GAME FOR A A PROP. SO ZAL WOULD, LIKE, GRAB AN EXECUTIVE WOMAN'S HANDBAG AND PULL SOMETHING OUT OF THE BAG. AND THAT WOULD BE THE KNIFE IN THE SCENE. YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE HER SUNGLASSES AND WE'D ACT THIS WHOLE THING OUT. AND AT THE END, I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME WE DID A PITCH LIKE THAT THE EXECUTIVE WAS JUST LOOKING AT US LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE WERE LIKE, WOW, THAT WENT SO BADLY. AND THEN HE LEANED ACROSS THE TABLE AND WAS LIKE, DON'T EVER CHANGE. AND IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT THAT HE REALLY ACTUALLY ENJOYED THAT PITCH. BECAUSE LATER ON A SCREENWRITER FRIEND TOLD ME, THAT IS NOT HOW YOU PITCH A SHOW, OR ANYTHING.
Jimmy: NO. YOU HAVE TO, LIKE, HAVE IT PIPE DOWN. IT'S VERY BORING.
YOU COME IN AND YOU SAY IT'S "TERMS OF ENDEARMENT" MEETS THE "GHOSTBUSTERS." LIKE, JUST GIVE THEM A MATCHUP THEY HAVEN'T SEEN AND LET THEM IMAGINE THE REST.
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT THIS IS HARD TO MATCH UP. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS HAPPENING IN THIS THING. BUT IT'S FANTASTIC. I'LL JUST SET THIS UP FOR PEOPLE SO THEY KIND OF UNDERSTAND. THE FIRST EPISODE BASICALLY YOUR CHARACTER IS -- HAS A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE. IS THAT RIGHT?
YES. A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE.
Jimmy: A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE. AND SHE GAINS HER SIGHT BACK.
YEAH.
Jimmy: SHE WAS BLIND.

Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
OR HER PARENTS.
Jimmy: NO ONE KNOW WHAT'S WENT -- DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS?
SHE WON'T TELL DANNY.
Danny: I'M NOT SAYING NOTHING.

Jimmy: MAYBE IT'S OPTICAL SOMETHING. OPTICAL ALIEN. OBSTI --
Danny: OPTIMUM ASS[ BLEEP ].
Jimmy: NO, NO, YOU CAN'T. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Danny: WHAT?
Jimmy: HE'S ACTUALLY RIGHT. I DID CHECK THAT. IT IS THAT. HE WAS RIGHT AGAIN.
