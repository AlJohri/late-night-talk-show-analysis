AS ADAM LEVINE. SAYING, "HEY, GOT YOUR INFO FROM MY MANAGER, JUST WANTED TO SAY IT WAS GREAT TALKING TO YOU. BY THE WAY, MY TATS ARE BASED ON YOURS. I SHOP AT BARBADOS. MY HAIRCUT -- I REALLY JUST WANT TO BE YOU." SO -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS GREAT. THIS IS GREAT.
THE NEXT DAY I SEE DAVE AND HE GOES, "WEIRDLY I GOT AN E-MAIL FROM ADAM." AND I SAID, "OH, COOL." HE GOES, "NO, NOT COOL. I'M OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M OUT." HE SAID, "THE GUY'S WEIRD AND IF I SEE HIM AGAIN I'M TELLING HIM TO STAY AWAY." [ LAUGHTER ] SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM, RIGHT? NOW SOMEONE'S HURT. TWO NICE GUYS GOING TO BE FRIENDS, I'M GOING TO BE THE SPOILER. SO I TELL HIM, "DAVE, I'M SORRY, IT WAS A BAD IDEA. I CREATED THE G --" "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" "I FAKED -- IT WAS A FAKE E -- I'M REALLY SORRY."
Jimmy: THAT'S HILARIOUS.
SO EVERYTHING'S FINE. TWO DAYS LATER I GET AN E-MAIL.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
NOW, THE BACK STORY TO THIS IS WHEN I WAS LIKE 18 I WAS IN A ROCK BAND AND MY CLAIM TO FAME WAS THE GUY IN MY BAND WENT ON TO BE THE DRUMMER IN QUEENSRYCHE. BIG METAL BAND, VERY SUCCESSFUL.
Jimmy: SURE.
I HAD TOLD DAVE THIS BRAGGING ONE DAY, "YOU KNOW, I WAS IN A BAND TOO."
Jimmy: YEAH.
I GET AN E-MAIL. THIS IS LIKE 25 YEARS. FROM THE DRUMMER, MY FRIEND. SO I KNOW IT'S GROHL. AND THIS E-MAIL IS SUPER NICE. IT SAYS "JEFF, MY MOM HAS FOLLOWED YOUR CAREER AND I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE A DAD, LET'S GET TOGETHER." I'M THINKING YEAH, RIGHT. SO I'M SUPER DICK. I WRITE BACK -- [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO.
"YOUR MOM WANTS TO GET TOGETHER? TELL YOUR MOM -- " [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. DON'T EVEN TELL ME HOW THIS ENDS. DON'T TELL ME HOW THIS ENDS. DAVE GROHL HAS NO IDEA.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. SO YOU JUST INSULTED --
AND I TELL HIM -- HE WON'T COP TO IT. AND I GO, "BECAUSE THE GUY -- BECAUSE DAVE, MY FRIEND LEFT HIS PHONE NUMBER, MAYBE I SHOULD CALL HIM." HE GOES, "MAYBE YOU SHOULD." I SAID, "OKAY, I WILL." AND I CALL. AND MY FRIEND, WHO'S MOM I TOLD TO -- ANSWERS THE PHONE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M DONE.
Jimmy: YOU'RE DONE. NO MORE PRANKS.
AND ALL THREE OF THOSE GUYS NICE GUYS. THE ONLY IDIOT WAS ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, I THINK WHAT YOU DID WAS RIGHT. [ APPLAUSE ] I THINK WHAT YOU DID WAS GOOD. IT WAS FUN. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR BAND DAYS. BECAUSE YOU AND THE BAND -- I GOT SOME PHOTOS HERE THAT ARE PRETTY AWESOME. LOOK AT THAT GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] WOW.
HERE'S THE DISTURBING PART. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND IMAGINE IT'S NOT HALLOWEEN. I ACTUALLY DRESSED UP MYSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] I WENT OUT WEARING THE VAN HALEN T-SHIRT.
Jimmy: I LOVE THIS. AND THIS -- YOU WERE GOING FOR IT. WERE YOU THE LEAD SINGER?
OF COURSE. YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE GIRLS.

Jimmy: TYRANT.

Jimmy: YEAH. WHEN YOU SEE THIS GUY I THINK OF TYRANT.
I'M THE LEAD SINGER FOR TYRANT.
Jimmy: AND DID YOU -- WHAT WERE YOUR SONGS LIKE? DO YOU REMEMBER ANY OF YOUR SONGS?
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T DO COVERS. WE JUST DID ORIGINALS. OF COURSE.
Jimmy: WHAT A BUMMER. THAT WOULD REALLY BUM ME OUT IF I WENT TO GO SEE TYRANT AND THEY DID ALL ORIGINALS. "DO VAN HALEN! PLEASE! GIVE ME ONE!"

Jimmy: YEAH, YOU CAN'T BE STUCK IN LOVE, MAN. YOU DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT STUFF.
WE PLAYED, LIKE, A ROLLER SKATING RINK. I MEAN, THIS IS NOT A BIG ROCK BAND.
Jimmy: NO, BUT STILL. WE'VE GOT TO BRING SOME CASSETTE TAPES THE NEXT TIME YOU COME. I WANT TO HEAR SOME STUFF. YOUR CAREER ENDED UP MUCH BETTER, BY THE WAY. I'M SO HAPPY YOU DECIDED TO GO THIS ROUTE. TELEVISION HAS BEEN VERY GOOD TO YOU.
