THANK YOU, YEAH. AND SO WE HAVE NUMBER TWO COMING OUT, ACROSS CANADA ON ST. PADDY'S DAY, AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT COMES OUT DOWN HERE. BUT WE'LL -- WE'LL HAVE THAT VERY SOON.
Jimmy: BUT THIS IS -- THIS IS ABOUT A HOCKEY GOON, A A HOCKEY PLAYER.
HOCKEY ENFORCER, YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD NAME FOR IT. YEAH.
YEAH. THE SORT OF, ONE OF THE ODDEST JOBS IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS IS A GUY ON, I MEAN, KIND OF BEING WORKED OUT OF THE NHL. BUT, YEAH. THERE'S A GUY ON EVERY HOCKEY TEAM, USED TO BE, WHOSE JOB WAS JUST TO FIGHT. AND SEEMS TO BE PRETTY FERTILE GROUND FOR DRAMA AND COMEDY. AND I'M SLIGHTLY BIASED, BECAUSE I ADORE THE MOVIE WE MADE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY YOU LIKE HOCKEY. BUT YEAH, OF COURSE, YEAH. YOU LIKE THE --

OH, GOD. I -- I AM --
Jimmy: MUST HAVE, YEAH?
ARGUABLY THE WORLD'S WORST SKATER. NO. IT'S -- I -- THIS IS GOING TO COME AS LIKE A MASSIVE SURPRISE. I AM NOT THE MOST ATHLETICALLY INCLINED PERSON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IS THAT REACTION? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SHOCKER.
SEE, THAT -- THAT IMPLIES THAT --
Jimmy: NO, THEY DON'T -- THEY'RE LAUGHING AT SOMETHING ELSE. THEY'RE LAUGHING AT SOMETHING ELSE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
NO, IT -- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, MOST OF IT IS JUST LIKE MY CRIPPLING LAZINESS. I JUST, LIKE -- YOU KNOW, IT JUST WASN'T EVER WORTH IT. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER PRACTICE I WOULD GO THROUGH, THE MINUTE THAT I WOULD DO WHATEVER LIKE -- SO, HITTING A BASEBALL. SKATING AROUND A RINK ONCE WITHOUT FALLING. AND I WOULD DO IT. AND I WAS LIKE, THIS -- THIS IS IT? THIS IS WHAT I'M WORKING TOWARDS? I'D MUCH RATHER READ COMICS IN MY BEDROOM. SO UH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND BE A FAN, AND ROOT FOR, AND WATCH HOCKEY.
THAT'S EXACTLY IT. THAT'S EXACTLY THAT. I REALIZED AT A CERTAIN POINT THAT, YOU KNOW, JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT SPORTS, MEANS YOU CAN STILL -- DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T ENJOY THEM. AND SO, I'VE LEVELED OUT.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO, WE CAN ENJOY THE SEQUEL AROUND, AFTER ST. PADDY'S DAY --
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: OR WE CAN JUST GO TO CANADA AROUND ST. PADDY'S DAY AND SEE IT.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT WERE ALL GOING TO DO.

AND SO FOR US TO ADD A LOVE INTEREST IN THIS SEASON AND HAVE ME MOVE IN WITH SOMEBODY 30 SECONDS INTO THE -- INTO THE SEASON, IT'S LIKE, HOW DO WE DO THAT HARD A POV SHIFT, BUT STILL GIVE THE WEIRD SHOW THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVING PEOPLE.

YOU'LL JUST FEEL IT OUT? ARE YOU CRAZY?
THEY'RE JUST PARENTS. IT'S FINE.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WALKING INTO. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

THIS IS SO EXCITING TO BE HERE, YOU GUYS! THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YES. YES! SO, 2017 HAS ACTUALLY STARTED OUT REALLY GREAT FOR ME. I FOUND OUT THAT I HAVE A A PEEPING TOM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YES, THAT IS CORRECT. THAT IS A GUY WHO HAS BEEN OUTSIDE OF MY WINDOW WATCHING ME WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE. AND I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS. YOU KNOW, I CALLED MY FRIEND IMMEDIATELY AND SHE WAS LIKE PANICKING, "OH, MY GOD, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?" AND I WAS LIKE, "WELL, NOTHING. THIS IS ACTUALLY THE HEALTHIEST RELATIONSHIP I HAVE EVER BEEN IN." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LIKE HE IS LOYAL. [ LAUGHTER ] HE SHOWS UP AT THE SAME TIME EVERY NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] SAYS VERY POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT MY BODY, YOU KNOW. I THINK I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS PEEPING TOM THING WORK. WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT ME THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT MORE SINCE I KNOW HE'S BEEN WATCHING ME? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT ME THAT I'VE REVIEWED MY GYM MEMBERSHIP? LOOK, I GOT TO KEEP THESE ABS TIGHT, 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO COME HOME AND HE'S AT THE NEIGHBOR'S WINDOW BECAUSE THAT'S JUST -- THAT IS REJECTION. [ APPLAUSE ] WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING RHONDA FOR? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN I GOT TO HAVE A TALK WITH RHONDA. EXCUSE ME, RHONDA, I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE JUST HIS SIDE PEEP. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT. HE MIGHT COME DABBLE OVER AT YOUR WINDOW WHEN HE GETS LONELY, BUT HE ALWAYS COMES BACK TO ME. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S MY MAN. I HAVE A VERY HARD TIME DATING, BECAUSE I HAVE A GREAT FATHER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T NORMALLY HEAR THAT, DO YOU? WHAT YOU NORMALLY HEAR IS WOMEN COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO DATE WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE A GOOD FATHER. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT ROLE MODEL TO LOOK UP TO AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW GUYS ARE SUPPOSED TO TREAT THEM. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE, WHEN YOU HAVE A GREAT FATHER, YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TREATED AND IT STINKS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE STANDARDS. AND EVERY GUY LIVES IN THE SHADOW OF MY AMAZING FATHER. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, MY FATHER IS SO GREAT THAT HE HAS NEVER LET MY MOM PUMP GAS. TRUE STORY. TRUE STORY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR 40 YEARS. AND IN 40 YEARS, JOYCE THOMPSON HAS NEVER TOUCHED A GAS PUMP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, I'M DATING GUYS THAT SIPHON GAS OUT OF MY TANK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. ME AND MY SISTER ARE BOTH VERY SINGLE AND IT IS MY DAD'S FAULT FOR BEING TOO PERFECT. YOU KNOW, HE JUST HAD TO COME HOME EVERY NIGHT, DIDN'T HE? HE JUST HAD TO COME HOME EVERY NIGHT AND PAY THE BILLS AND LOVE US AND STUFF. YOU KNOW? LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU KNOW? MY FRIEND, DEBBIE, SHE HAD A A TERRIBLE FATHER GROWING UP AND SHE'S BEEN UNHAPPILY MARRIED NOW FOR SIX YEARS AND THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ME! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO. NO. MY FATHER HAD TO DRINK ALCOHOL IN MODERATION. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S SELFISH. I GREW UP IN A TWO-PARENT HOUSEHOLD, WHICH I DON'T LIKE BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPECT YOU TO SUCCEED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH, IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE. IT'S ACTUALLY GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHEN I ENVY MY FRIENDS WHO DON'T HAVE FATHERS, BECAUSE THEY GET TO MESS UP A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW? MY FRIEND DEBBIE THAT I MENTIONED, WHO DIDN'T HAVE A A FATHER GROWING UP, EVERY LITTLE THING THAT SHE DID, EVERYONE WAS SO IMPRESSED BY IT. "CANDICE, CAN YOU BELIEVE DEBBIE GOT HER G.E.D?" [ LAUGHTER ] "CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? IT IS A MIRACLE, PRAISE JESUS. YOU KNOW SHE DOESN'T HAVE A A FATHER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE, I COME HOME WITH A A FOUR-YEAR DEGREE, COME HOME TO ALL TYPES OF DISAPPOINTMENT. "A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. WITH ALL OF YOUR PARENTS?" [ LAUGHTER ] "WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ASTRONAUT LAWYER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GET IT TOGETHER. IT'S A WASTE OF PARENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW I AM MIXED. BOTH MY PARENTS ARE BLACK AND NATIVE AMERICAN. THAT IS CORRECT, BLACK AND NATIVE AMERICAN. AND APPARENTLY, WHEN THE TWO MOST OPPRESSED RACES UNITE, THIS CHILD JUST COMES OUT LOOKING WHITE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. THAT ACTUALLY IS THE RECIPE IF YOU GO ON PINTEREST. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE ONE THING THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED THAT I'VE NEVER GOTTEN THROUGHOUT LIFE IS THE NOD. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NOD IS -- THE NOD IS WHEN A A BLACK PERSON WALKS INTO A A ROOM AND MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH THE ONLY OTHER BLACK PERSON IN THE ROOM, SOMETHING MAGICAL HAPPENS. AND IT LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE NOD. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC. I'VE BEEN CANDICE THOMPSON. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH! SIDE PEEP. CANDICE THOMPSON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CANDICE THOMPSON! FOR MORE FROM CANDICE, PLEASE VISIT CANDICETHOMPSONCOMEDY.COM.
