Questlove: 470, ATL.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU GUYS EXCITED? THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. HOT CROWD! HOT NEW YORK CITY CROWD! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, YOU GUYS MADE IT. THIS IS THE SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. YOU GUYS, WE HAVE DRAKE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DRAKE, THAT'S RIGHT, A BLACK, JEWISH, IMMIGRANT RAPPER FROM CANADA. [ LAUGHTER ] OR AS DONALD TRUMP WOULD SAY, "I'M SPEECHLESS. I NEED TO SIT DOWN, I'M GETTING LIGHTHEADED. I'M GETTING LIGHTHEADED. I'M SEEING MY SPIRIT ANIMAL." [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF TRUMP, IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, HE SAID THAT HE'S HOPING TO MAKE THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION MORE FUN BY HIRING SOME ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH IS CONFUSING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT DONALD TRUMP WAS THE ENTERTAINMENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY GO, "NO, NO, NO." IN A "NEW YORK TIMES" INTERVIEW YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP COMPARED HIS CANDIDACY TO BOTH BROADWAY SHOWS AND BASEBALL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH, 'CAUSE BOTH START OFF REALLY FUN AND END WITH HALF OF THE PEOPLE SAYING, "WAIT, IS THIS STILL GOING ON? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IS IT OVER? I'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE, MAN." I HATE TO BREAK IT TO TRUMP, BUT THERE IS ALREADY A BROADWAY SHOW CALLED "HAIRSPRAY." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY-WOAH! HEY-OH! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! ♪♪ "HAIRSPRAY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE BIG STORY IS THAT TODAY WAS THE LONG-AWAITED MEETING BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE PAUL RYAN. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] OR AS TRUMP PUT IT, "THIS GUY ONLY HAS ONE HOUSE? SAD. IT'S SAD. [ LAUGHTER ] AT LEAST THREE HOUSES." [ LAUGHTER ] TRUMP MET WITH HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN IN AN EFFORT TO UNIFY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND AFTER THE MEETING, PAUL RYAN ACTUALLY GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT WENT, AND WELL, IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL HOW HE FELT ABOUT IT. WATCH.
LET ME SAY THIS, I THINK WE HAD A VERY ENCOURAGING MEETING. AND AGAIN, I'M VERY ENCOURAGED. I HEARD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS FROM OUR PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE. I WAS VERY ENCOURAGED WITH WHAT I HEARD FROM DONALD TRUMP TODAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS OUR FIRST MEETING, I WAS VERY ENCOURAGED WITH THIS MEETING. AND I AM VERY ENCOURAGED THAT WE CAN PUT THAT TOGETHER. I THINK WE'RE OFF TO AN ENCOURAGING START. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE ROCKING BACK AND FORTH IN A STRAITJACKET. IT'S LIKE, "OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] VERY ENCOURAGED. SO ENCOURAGING. IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING. THAT'S RIGHT! ENCOURAGING." SOME BIG TV NEWS. IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT MORLEY SAFER WILL RETIRE FROM "60 MINUTES" LATER THIS MONTH AFTER 46 YEARS WITH THE SHOW.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: WOW. WHEN ASKED WHAT HE PLANS TO DO NOW THAT HE'S RETIRED, HE SAID, "WATCH '60 MINUTES.'" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. I'LL GET TO ENJOY IT.

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, ALL HER EX-BOYFRIENDS ARE LIKE, "OH, NOW SHE'S INTO COUPLES THERAPY. I MEAN, I HAD AN ALBUM WRITTEN ABOUT ME." [ APPLAUSE ] IF YOU LIKE BURGER KING, YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS. BURGER KING JUST UNVEILED A NEW ITEM COMBINING THE ELEMENTS OF A WHOPPER AND A HOT DOG KNOWN AS THE "WHOPPER DOG." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, AS IN, "I'VE GOT TO TAKE A SICK DAY, I JUST ATE A A WHOPPER DOG." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, THIS IS PRETTY SCARY. I SAW THAT BRITISH RESEARCHERS ARE WARNING THAT ONE-FIFTH OF THE WORLD'S PLANT SPECIES ARE AT RISK OF EXTINCTION. EVEN WORSE, KALE IS EXPECTED TO SURVIVE.

I'M GONNA HANG OUT HERE. THAT'S RIGHT, LIFER.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A NEW YORKER.
I'M A NEW YORK STATER.
Jimmy: NEW YORK STATER. YEAH, THAT COUNTS.
I'VE BEEN A NEW YORKER FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH. WERE YOU BORN IN SYRACUSE?
I SPENT THE FIRST NINE YEARS OF MY LIFE IN SYRACUSE AND THE REST IN ALBANY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: ALBANY, NEW YORK, YEAH.
YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: I WENT TO COLLEGE IN ALBANY.
I REMEMBER YOU FROM A COUPLE OF BARS UP THERE.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, THAT WAS ME.
GOOD TIMES.
Jimmy: SEE THAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER YOU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'VE BEEN AT THE BAR A LONG TIME. GOSH, I LOVE ALBANY. I MISS IT. I HAVE TO GO BACK.
I KNOW. YOU KNOW, I LOVE GOING UP THERE 'CAUSE IT KEEPS YOU HUMBLE. IT JUST REMINDS YOU OF ALL YOUR VALUES. I FEEL LIKE, UPSTATE NEW YORK IS MORE LIKE MIDWESTERN VALUES.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
AND MY MOM IS STILL THERE, SO THAT'S ALWAYS HUMBLING.
Jimmy: SHE MUST BE PROUD.
MY MOM HAS A VERY FUNNY APPROACH TO SORT OF, MY, YOU KNOW, STATUS AS A PUBLIC FIGURE NOW. WHICH IS -- SHE ALWAYS, YOU KNOW, HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP YOUR HAIR LIKE THAT?
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHO TOLD YOU YOU LOOK GOOD IN GRAY?
Jimmy: THANKS, MOM, YEAH.
BUT THEN SHE LOVES IT AS IT RELATES TO HER. SO WE'LL GO OUT TO DINNER AND SHE'LL BE LIKE, STAND UP SO PEOPLE CAN SEE WHO YOU ARE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE LIKE, MOM, I'M COMING HOME BECAUSE I WANT A HOME COOKED MEAL.
NO.
Jimmy: THERE'S RESTAURANTS IN NEW YORK CITY, YEAH.
I DON'T WANT TO. AND SHE'LL SAY, LIKE, ALL OF MY DOCTORS SAW YOU ON THE COVER OF "VANITY FAIR." I'M LIKE, WELL HOW DID THEY SEE IT? SHE'S LIKE, BECAUSE I SHOWED IT TO ALL OF THEM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WALK AROUND WITH THE PHOTO ALBUM OF ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE DONE.
BUT SHE NEVER MENTIONED IT TO ME. SHE WOULD NEVER MENTION IT TO ME, SO IT'S GOOD. IT KEEPS YOUR HEAD IN CHECK.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT. IT'S THE GREATEST. MY MOM CRITICIZES ALL MY SHOWS, CRITIQUES.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jimmy: SHE DOES CRITICIZE ME, YEAH. SHE SCOLDS ME ON TWITTER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT HAS TO STOP.
YOU HAVE TO ADAPT TO THE DEAL THAT I NOW HAVE WITH MY MOM WHICH IS, I'M NOW, YOU KNOW, NOW I'M 45. SO I SAID MOM, I HAVE A GREAT NEW SYSTEM. FOR EVERY INSULT YOU GIVE ME, I GET TO GIVE YOU ONE BACK.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
YOU CAN FEEL THE WIND UP.
Jimmy: THEN IT STOPS, YEAH.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU. YEAH, YEAH, SO FINE, I'M READY FOR IT. I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU, TOO.
Jimmy: YOU LOOK GREAT IN GRAY. YEAH, EXACTLY. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR, MOM. YOU DID LOOK FANTASTIC, BY THE WAY, AT THE KENTUCKY DERBY.
OH, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I SAW A PHOTO OF YOU THERE AT THE DERBY THERE WITH THE HAT.
YES.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE HAT.
YOU GOTTA DO IT.
Jimmy: THIS HAT HAS A NAME, RIGHT?
THE FASCINATOR.
Jimmy: YES, THE FASCINATOR.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT UNTIL KELLY RIPA TOLD ME.
Jimmy: OH, IS THAT RIGHT? AND THEN, BUT HERE'S YOU BEFORE THE KENTUCKY DERBY, YOU WERE GETTING READY. AND I LIKE THIS LOOK BETTER. YEAH, THIS IS FANTASTIC. BUT, DID YOU HAVE FUN AT THE DERBY?
AND NOW MY RUSE TO GET MYSELF BACK ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW" IS COMPLETE.
Jimmy: NO, WE TOTALLY WANT -- PLEASE, YOU CAN COME BACK WHENEVER YOU WANT TO.
NO, WE HAD A GREAT TIME.
Jimmy: I LOVE THE DERBY.
IT WAS VERY COOL, IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. I DID MAKE ONE FAUX PAS, HOWEVER. I BET ON SUDDEN BREAKING NEWS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.
Jimmy: HELLO.
AND WE WENT DOWN TO THE PADDOCK AND THERE WAS A GUY WHO SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING, WHO SAID, HEY, YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT TODAY? I SAID, SUDDEN BREAKING NEWS. HE SAID, YOU FEELING ANYTHING ABOUT NYQUIST? I'M LIKE, NAH!
Jimmy: YEAH.
HE WAS LIKE, OH, TOO BAD, 'CASUE IT'S MY HORSE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SORRY, I MEANT TO SAY THAT'S MY FAVORITE.
BUT, HE HAD THE LAST LAUGH. HE WON, HE WON.
Jimmy: HE WON, ABSOLUTELY. IT WAS EXCITING. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS THING BECAUSE THERE IS A BIG SPECIAL COMING UP, PRIMETIME SPECIAL AND YOU'RE INTERVIEWING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE, BUT ONE OF THE -- AND WHO ARE YOU INTERVIEWING FOR THIS SPECIAL?
SO, DONALD TRUMP. YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR.
Jimmy: I WAS GOING TO END WITH DONALD TRUMP. [ CHEERS ] BECAUSE, YOU GUYS DIDN'T REALLY GET ALONG? YOU GUYS HAVE TALKED BEFORE?
SO WE DIDN'T -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M JUST KIDDING.
MOSTLY THROUGH TWITTER.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. MOSTLY ONE-SIDED, YEAH.
WE DID NOT TALK FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN I REACHED OUT TO HIM IN APRIL, AND ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD MEET WITH ME.
Jimmy: YOU REACHED OUT AFTER THE DEBATES, YOU GUYS DIDN'T REALLY TALK?
WELL, I MEAN, THERE HAD BEEN, THERE WAS A LULL IN THE TWEETS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND, YOU KNOW, I HAD WANTED TO GO SPEAK WITH HIM. I JUST -- I WANTED HIM TO STOP, AND I KNEW IF I COULD GET FACE TO FACE WITH HIM HE WOULD STOP. YOU KNOW, I THINK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS MOTIVATIONS WERE FOR THE WHOLE DUST UP, BUT --
Jimmy: BUT YOU WENT TO SEE HIM. YOU WENT TO TRUMP TOWER?
YEAH, I CONTACTED HIM AND ASKED IF HE WOULD SEE ME, AT FIRST HE SAID NO. AND THEN I ASKED AGAIN AND HE SAID YES.
Jimmy: REALLY?
I WENT DOWN THERE ONE MORNING AND WALKED INTO TRUMP TOWER AND GOT PAST A BUNCH OF EYEBALLS THAT WERE AS BIG AS SAUCERS.
Jimmy: THEY'RE LIKE, WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?
HONESTLY THE DOOR MAN IS LIKE --
Jimmy: WERE YOU BY YOURSELF?
OH, OH!
Jimmy: YEAH.
HELLO!
Jimmy: I'LL LET HIM KNOW YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY.
HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?
Jimmy: MR. TRUMP, SHE IS HERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THE ONE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED.
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT'D GO.
Jimmy: DID YOU GO WITH AN ENTOURAGE? DID YOU GO WITH A CREW?
NO. I WENT BY MYSELF.
Jimmy: REALLY?
I WANTED TO DO IT BY MYSELF. I KNEW IF I COULD GET FACE TO FACE WITH HIM JUST THE TWO OF US, AND I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD BE ALONE, AND HE AGREED, THAT I COULD SPEAK TO HIM, YOU KNOW. WE DIDN'T ADDRESS ANYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T ASK HIM ABOUT ANY OF THE TWEETS OR ANY OF THE THINGS BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING TO MOVE PAST THAT. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE ACRIMONIOUS PLACE. SO WE HAD A NORMAL CONVERSATION LIKE CANDIDATE AND REPORTER, AND THEN WE DID. THEN WE SAT DOWN TOGETHER FOR AN INTERVIEW AND IN THAT INTERVIEW WE DO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT WILL AIR ON TUESDAY NIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
OH WAIT, I WANT TO TELL YOU, SO IT'S ON THE FOX BROADCAST NETWORK WHICH IS NOT THE SAME AS FOX NEWS CHANNEL, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.

YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T FEEL THAT THE MODERATORS HAD BEEN NICE. BUT, DO YOU THINK IT'S THE JOURNALIST'S ROLE TO BE NICE TO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AT A A DEBATE?
FAIR, I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE NICE.
BUT YOU USED THE WORD NICE.
WELL, OKAY. NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I MEAN, I MIGHT HAVE SAID THEY WEREN'T NICE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO BE NICE. I'VE KNOWN MANY --
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A A COCKTAIL PARTY.
NO, NO. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IN A A CERTAIN WAY, WHAT YOU DID MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FAVOR. BECAUSE I FELT SO GOOD ABOUT HAVING GOTTEN THROUGH. I SAID, IF I CAN GET THROUGH THIS DEBATE, WITH THOSE QUESTIONS, YOU CAN GET THROUGH ANYTHING. MY THANKS TO MEGYN KELLY. "MEGYN KELLY PRESENTS" AIRS TUESDAY AT 8:00 P.M. ON FOX.
