Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR THE -- THEY KNOW THE HITS.
THEY KNOW THE HITS.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR DOING "CATCHPHRASE." CONGRATS ON EVERYTHING, I'VE GOT TO SAY.
THANK YOU, MAN. THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: IT'S SO EXCITING. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SHOW. I KNOW YOU -- I KNOW YOUR STAND-UP PRETTY WELL. WHEN DID YOU START DOING STAND-UP?
I STARTED DOING STAND-UP WHEN I WAS ABOUT 19-YEARS-OLD. AND I STARTED IN NEW YORK, BUT THEN I WENT ON THE ROAD RIGHT AWAY, JUST BECAUSE THOSE ACTUALLY PAY. BECAUSE SHOWS IN NEW YORK ARE LIKE NINE PEOPLE AND EIGHT OF THEM ARE COMICS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND ONE OF THEM IS LIKE A PILE OF CLOTHES. SO, I WENT OUT ON THE ROAD TO DO SHOWS RIGHT AWAY. LIKE I WAS DOING -- IN MY EARLY 20s I WAS DOING A A SHOW IN MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEE.
Jimmy: NOPE.
MURFREESBORO. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M PRONOUNCING IT CORRECTLY. I'M NOT MISPRONOUNCING IT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT, NO.
THAT'S HOW IT'S PRONOUNCED.
Jimmy: THAT'S A PLACE?
MURFREESBORO. I THINK IT WAS NAMED BY A DYING CONFEDERATE GENERAL AS HE BARELY SAT UP IN BED EATING MASHED POTATOES. AND HIS GRANDSON WAS LIKE, "PAPPI, YOU GOT TO NAME THE TOWN!" AND HE WAS LIKE "MURFREESBORO." [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE LIKE, "PUT IT ON THE SIGN!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT'S SEEMS LIKE AN ODD NAME.
THERE'S ABOUT NINE R's IN MURFREESBORO. I WAS DOING STAND-UP. IT'S ONE OF THE WORST SHOWS I EVER HAD. I WAS DOING STAND-UP COMEDY IN MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AT AN OUTDOOR CAMP GROUND NEXT TO A BEER TRUCK.
Jimmy: OH! THAT SOUNDS AWFUL.
YES. WELL, LATER SOME WOULD ALLEGE THAT I WAS BLOCKING THE BEER TRUCK. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I DISAGREE WITH THAT.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.
I WAS DOING THE SHOW ON PURPOSE.
Jimmy: OF COURSE YOU WERE.
IT SOUNDS AWFUL, BUT IT WASN'T A MISTAKE.
Jimmy: IT WAS A GIG.
YEAH, IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS DRIVING ACROSS THE SOUTH IN AN OLD JALOPY AND IT BROKE DOWN. AND THE PEOPLE OF MURFREESBORO WERE LIKE, "WE'LL GIVE YOU SUPPER, BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE FUNNY FOR US TONIGHT." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEANT TO DO IT. I HAD IT ON MY CALENDAR. I WAS LIKE, "OH BOY, OH BOY. ONLY TWO MORE WEEKS UNTIL THE WORST NIGHT OF MY ENTIRE LIFE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT THEY DIDN'T APPRECIATE YOU?
WELL, NO. I GOT TO THE SHOW -- "SHOW." I PUT SHOW IN MANY QUOTES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW MANY QUOTES?
AS MANY QUOTES AS THERE ARE R's IN MURFREESBORO. [ LAUGHTER ] TAKE ALL THE R's AND MAKE 'EM QUOTES. I GET OUT ON THE STAGE. THE STAGE WAS REALLY NICE, A A LOT LIKE THIS, EXCEPT NOT AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS A COUPLE OF TWO-BY-FOURS LYING IN DIRT. I START TO PERFORM STAND-UP COMEDY, OKAY? AND ONE GUY YELLS FROM THE BACK, WHAT IS THE BEST HECKLE I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE. HE YELLS, "EXCUSE ME, SIR. I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE HERE WHEN I SAY THAT WE WOULD ENJOY SILENCE THAN THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT?
YES. INSANELY MEAN, NO? BUT ALSO, HOW VERY ELOQUENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT IS THE MOST ELOQUENT HECKLE I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.
IT'S LIKE A BEAUTIFUL TURN OF PHRASE, TO ENJOY SILENCE MORE THAN THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE. IF THAT WAS LIKE, THE LAST LINE OF A MAYA ANGELOU POEM, YOU WOULD YOU SHUT THE BOOK AND LOOK OUT THE WINDOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TURN OF PHRASE.
Jimmy: CONGRATS ON THE SHOW, "MULANEY", SUNDAY AT 9:30. THIS IS VERY EXCITING. MARTIN SHORT --
YEAH!
Jimmy: ELLIOTT GOULD, NASIM PEDRAD.
NASIM PEDRAD FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."
Jimmy: I MEAN, THIS IS A A GREAT CAST OF PEOPLE.
IT'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: AND I WANT TO TELL EVERYONE, THERE'S A LITTLE EASTER EGG. IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW, YOU KNOW AT THE BEGINNING OF SITCOMS THEY GO "'MULANEY' WAS TAPED IN FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE?"
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHICH IS A THROWBACK. THEY USED TO DO THAT IN THE '70s.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT YOU GOT ICE-T TO DO THE VOICEOVER. [ LAUGHTER ]
YES.
Jimmy: THAT IS GENIUS RIGHT THERE. HOW AND WHY? IT MAKES NO SENSE.
I HAD DONE SOME STAND-UP JOKES ABOUT ICE-T AND HIS WORK ON "LAW AND ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT", WHICH IS THE FINEST SHOW ON TELEVISION. [ CHEERS ] SO, I WAS APPROACHED TO BE ON HIS PODCAST, "FINAL LEVEL" AND I WASN'T ABLE TO DO IT. BUT WE GOT TO TALKING AND I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD DO THE INTRO. SO WE RECORDED HIM BY SAYING "'MULANEY' WAS SHOT IN FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE, OKAY?" [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT SOUNDS WEIRD.
THEN WE WERE RECORDING IT AND HE WAS LIKE, "WAIT A A SECOND. IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M SAYING YOU GOT SHOT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW ICE-T SAYS THAT, YEAH.
THE WAY HE HIT THE WORD "SHOT" WAS NOT HOW I MEANT IT.
Jimmy: MULANEY WAS SHOT.
YEAH, MULANEY GOT SHOT. [ LAUGHTER ] DOT, DOT, DOT, IN FRONT OF A A LIVE --
Jimmy: WHAT DID YOU CHANGE IT DO?
"'MULANEY' WAS FILMED IN FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE."
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT.
BUT I HAD HIM DO A BUNCH OF THINGS AND RECORD THE CAST INTROS, AND HE WOULD THROW IN LITTLE ASIDES. HE WAS LIKE, "STARRING MARTIN SHORT. OH, I MET MARTY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'D JUST THROW THAT IN THERE? OH, I MET HIM.
JUST AN ASIDE.
Jimmy: WE HAVE A CLIP. THIS IS WHERE YOU'VE JUST ASKED THE PRIEST TO LIE TO YOUR PARENTS AND TELL THEM THAT YOU GO TO CHURCH.
YES. BECAUSE THEY --
Jimmy: WHY WOULD YOU GET INVOLVED AND YOU MAKE A PRIEST LIE?
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO, TELL THE TRUTH? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, I DON'T -- NO. HERE'S JOHN MULANEY IN "MULANEY."
LOOK, PLEASE, JUST DO THIS FOR ME AND I PROMISE YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO SEE ME AGAIN.
WE'RE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, WE WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN, THAT'S OUR GOAL. [ LAUGHTER ] I SUGGEST YOU DO SOME PRAYING.
YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK, RIGHT? NEVER MIND, FATHER. I'M SORRY I DISRESPECTED YOU WITH THAT REQUEST. HEY -- I'M DOING THIS SET FOR THE "TONIGHT SHOW" BOOKER NEXT WEEK AND IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL. IF YOU COULD -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU JIMMY.
Jimmy: I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, MAN.
