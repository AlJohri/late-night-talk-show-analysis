[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE STARS IN THE NEW MOVIE, "SPLIT", WHICH IS ABOUT A MAN WITH 24 DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES. AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER WAY TO SEE A GUY DEAL WITH OVER 20 CRAZY PERSONALITIES, WATCHING AN EPISODE OF "THE BACHELOR." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN DO IT. IT ACTUALLY WAS PRETTY CHILLY HERE TODAY IN NEW YORK. 38 DEGREES. COINCIDENTALLY, 38 DEGREES IS A A 98 DEGREES COVER BAND THAT ALSO TURNED DOWN PERFORMING AT TRUMP'S INAUGURATION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WEIRD COINCIDENCE. THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. IT'S REPORTED THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL USE TWO BIBLES WHEN HE TAKES THE OATH OF OFFICE. WHEN ASKED WHY, HE SAID, "IN CASE MY HAND BURNS THROUGH THE FIRST ONE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?
Steve: WHAT?

Jimmy: YEAH. BUT I LOVE THAT YOU COME OUT AND DANCE AND YOU -- YOU BREAK DANCE ON OUR SHOW BEFORE. YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD FUN WITH US. AND I ACTUALLY -- WE TALKED TO YOUR MOM. WE GOT HER TO SEND US SOME FOOTAGE OF YOU AS A CHILD. EIGHT MILLIMETER FOOTAGE, SO THERE'S NO SOUND ON IT. BUT I JUST WANT TO -- LOOK AT YOUNG NICK OFFERMAN AND LOOK AT THE -- LOOK AT THE, THE DANCING -- HEY! [ LAUGHTER ] OOH, MUSCLES! WHAT'S UP, BABY! WHAT? MAGIC!
IF I WASN'T DESTINED FOR SHOWBIZ. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK AT THESE MOVES! UH, HILARIOUS FRISBEE HAT.
Jimmy: AND THEN -- OH, OH ZOMBIE GUY! I LOVE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, WHAT WAS THAT? WAS THAT LIKE A FUN PARTY OR?
THAT WAS -- IT WAS A NEW THING. SOMEBODY WAS ROLLING AN EIGHT MILLIMETER CAMERA. THAT WAS OUR FISHING CABIN IN MINNESOTA. AND I HEARD A CAMERA ROLLING. I MEAN, I HAD NO IDEA I WAS GOING TO GO INTO SHOWBIZ AT THE TIME. AND I WAS LIKE, CAMERA? YOU WANT TO GET A LOAD OF THIS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S THAT SAYING? GET SOME OF THIS.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A STUD RIGHT THERE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WELL, I MEAN, GOSH, YOUR -- THEY GOT TO BE PROUD OF YOU, FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
I HOPE SO. 'CAUSE CAN'T GET THEM ON THE PHONE THOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AFTER THE SHOW TAPED, MOM, IF YOU'RE WATCHING, GIVE 'EM A CALL. YEAH.
MOM -- MOMMY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "MOMMY." NICK, YOU'RE SO GOOD IN THIS FILM. "THE FOUNDER." YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO GO NUTS. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING -- OF COURSE, I LOVE McDONALD'S. I EAT McDONALD'S MY WHOLE LIFE. IT IS JUST PART OF EVERYONE'S, I MEAN --
IT IS AN INSTITUTION.
Jimmy: IT TOTALLY IS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT I REMEMBER GOING TO MY McDONALD'S IN SAUGERTIES, NEW YORK, AND SEEING A -- A A PLAQUE OF -- THAT SAYS RAY KROC. AND I GO, OH, RAY KROK. THAT'S THE GUY THAT INVENTED McDONALD'S.
YEAH --
Jimmy: AND I NEVER -- IT'S NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE McDONALD BROTHERS.
NO. I MEAN THAT WAS -- THAT WAS RAY KROC'S PROPAGANDA. LIKE HE, HE -- AND THAT'S WHAT THE -- THAT'S WHAT THE MOVIE'S ABOUT. IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND, WHEN YOU FIND OUT HOW McDONALD'S BEGAN. BECAUSE HE BURIED IT AND WAS LIKE, IT WAS MY IDEA. I THOUGHT ALL THIS UP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR MONEY, AND I'M PUTTING MORE CHEMICALS IN YOUR BURGERS. YOU KNOW, LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT, YEAH. IT TASTES GOOD THOUGH. BUT --
THEY'RE -- THEY'RE TASTY [ BLEEP ] CHEMICALS.
Jimmy: THEY'RE TASTY CHEMICALS. [ LAUGHTER ]
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
Jimmy: THIS IS IN -- IT BLEW MY MIND. MICHAEL KEATON, OR COURSE, IS PERFECT TO PLAY THIS 'CAUSE HE'S SO LIKABLE.
HE'S AMAZING IN THIS MOVIE!
Jimmy: HE'S SO LIKABLE. AND OF COURSE YOUR LIKE, YOU AND IS IT -- JOHN CARROLL LYNCH?
JOHN CARROLL LYNCH.
Jimmy: AGAIN, BOTH OF YOU GUYS ARE JUST PHENOMENAL.
THESE TWO HARD WORKING GUYS, HAD MORE LIKE A DRIVE-IN DINER, AND THEY NOTICED THAT THEY WERE SELLING 87% OF THEIR SALES WAS HAMBURGERS, FRIES AND SOFT DRINKS. SO THEY GOT RID OF 42 OTHER MENU ITEMS AND JUST PUT THAT ON THE MENU. AND THEN THEY SAID, OKAY, NOW HOW CAN WE DELIVER THE FOOD IN 30 SECONDS INSTEAD OF 30 MINUTES. AND SO THEY BROKE DOWN AND THEY DESIGNED THIS FAST FOOD KITCHEN, JUST LIKE HENRY FORD DESIGNED THE -- THE ASSEMBLY LINE.
Jimmy: IT IS PHENOMENAL TO WATCH. AND I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A A CLIP. HERE'S NICK OFFERMAN, WHO'S PLAYING DICK McDONALD --
DICK McDONALD.
Jimmy: AND -- AND TALKING TO MICHAEL KEATON, WHO'S PLAYING RAY KROC, WHO IS THE FOUNDER. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
McDONALD'S.
JUST FOUND A WAY TO SAVE YOU, ME AND ALL OUR OWNER/OPERATORS LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN ELECTRICAL COST.
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE?
TWO WORDS. POWDERED MILKSHAKE. I'VE TELLING YOU I CAME ACROSS A REMARKABLE PRODUCT CALLED INSTA-MIX. LIKE I SAY, IT'S A POWDERED MILK SHAKE. IT'S A FRACTION OF THE COST OF ICE CREAM, AND REQUIRES NO REFRIGERATION.
GREAT.
I TELL YOU, I'VE TRIED IT MYSELF. IT TASTES JUST LIKE THE REAL THING. IT'S DELICIOUS. COMES IN CHOCOLATE, COMES IN VANILLA. ME, I'M A VANILLA MAN.
RAY, WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN MILKSHAKE THAT CONTAINS NO MILK. WHY DON'T WE ADD SAW DUST TO THE HAMBURGERS WHILE WERE AT IT? FROZEN FRENCH FRIES?
YOU DON'T WANT TO SAVE A A BUNDLE?
NOT LIKE THAT.
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME GREAT TASTE, SAME GREAT TASTE, WHILE BOOSTING THE BOTTOM LINE.
IT'S CALLED A MILKSHAKE, RAY. REAL MILK. NOW AND FOREVER.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THE HAIRCUT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU, TOO BUDDY. YOU CAN PULL THAT OFF. GREAT ACTING JOB.
