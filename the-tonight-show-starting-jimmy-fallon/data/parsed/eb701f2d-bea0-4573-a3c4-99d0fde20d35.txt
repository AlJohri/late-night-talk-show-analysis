ALL RIGHT, GOOD. HERE WE GO.
Jimmy: I COULD PUT THIS BEHIND ME HERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE EVERY NIGHT THOUGH! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I KIND OF DO LOOK LIKE THAT. YOU LOOK KIND OF CONFUSED THAT'S GOOD. AND SO, TRUMP IS TALKING AND THEN THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, THIS IS GOOD. WELL, FIRST OF ALL --
I GET THE POINT.
Jimmy: WHY DO YOU SUPPORT TRUMP OVER KASICH AND TED CRUZ?
BECAUSE I THINK HE'S BETTER THAN THEM.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
IT'S NOT REALLY HARD.
Jimmy: YEAH. NO.
THAT'S WHY YOU DO IT. I MEAN, IT WASN'T LIKE I DREW IT OUT OF A HAT OR SOMETHING, JIMMY. YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: NO, I KNOW THAT.
IT WAS MY JUDGMENT THAT I THOUGHT HE WAS BETTER THAN THE OTHER TWO.
Jimmy: AND DO YOU STILL THINK THAT?
AND BY THE WAY, THERE WAS ONE OTHER REASON, YOU DID NOT DECLARE. IF YOU DECLARED DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME, THEN THINGS MIGHT HAVE REALLY GOTTEN --
Jimmy: YOU WOULD HAVE HAD GOT MY BACK.
I WOULD HAVE, OF COURSE. YOU GOT THE PIN.
Jimmy: I APPRECIATE THAT. I DO. I GOT THE PIN, YEAH.
YEAH, YOU GOT THE PIN. I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT, SURE.
Jimmy: I'M GONNA ASK YOU THE QUESTION THAT EVERYONE'S ASKED YOU ALL THE TIME.
OKAY, SURE. WHICH ONE?
Jimmy: WELL, HIS V.P. IF TRUMP IS THE NOMINEE, WOULD YOU CONSIDER VICE PRESIDENT?
I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT ANYONE WOULD ASK ME TO BE VICE PRESIDENT.
Jimmy: REALLY? YOU REALLY DO?
WHAT'S THE SENSE OF THAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I CAN MOVE. I'LL GET THAT OTHER ONE.
LIKE WHEN YOU'RE VICE PRESIDENT, THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT YOU DO, RIGHT?
Jimmy: THAT'S YOU'RE JOB.
SO I GOT TO GET BETTER AT IT.
Jimmy: THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT YOU DO, YEAH.
I GOT TO GET BETTER AT IT THAN THAT OBVIOUSLY.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S OUT NOW.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S DONE. ALL RIGHT, NOW WE CAN ACTUALLY REALLY TALK.
I'D LIKE TO, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO, WHEN THE GOVERNOR THING'S OVER, 'CAUSE I GOT ABOUT 20 MONTHS LEFT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHEN IT'S OVER, I'D MAYBE LIKE TO PLAY TAMBOURINE IN THE ROOTS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO, THEY'LL THINK ABOUT IT. THEY CAN DO IT. THEY CAN MAKE IT WORK. WE CAN MAKE IT WORK.
I NEED SOMETHING. I WON'T BE BAD.
Jimmy: I KNOW YOU'RE GOOD WITH MUSIC. I SWEAR, I'LL KEEP QUIET.
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT I DO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE BIG SCANDAL THAT YOU HAVE GOING ON.
WHICH ONE'S THAT?
Jimmy: WELL THIS IS, YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT.
I DO.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE M&M'S SCANDAL.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS YOU -- THIS IS A PICTURE OF YOU AND YOU WERE JUST POURING M&M'S INTO YOUR OTHER OR EXISTING BOX OF M&M'S.
NO, NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LIKE YOU CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS DOING.
Jimmy: NO THAT'S WHY IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. WHY WOULD EVEN PEOPLE THINK THAT?
NO. IT'S NOT WHAT I WAS DOING.
Jimmy: WHY WOULD PEOPLE THINK THAT?
NOW, LISTEN, FOR ANYBODY WHO'S GONE TO AN ARENA YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. YOU BUY THE BOX OF M&M'S, RIGHT?
Jimmy: BY THE WAY, I KNEW THIS. I KNEW THIS.
I KNOW. YOU BUY THE BOX OF M&M'S, YOU BRING IT TO YOUR SEAT, YOU OPEN THE BOX OF M&M'S, AND THERE'S A A BAG OF M&M'S INSIDE THE BOX OF M&M'S. IT IS AN EMPTY BOX WITH A BAG OF M&M'S IN IT. SO THEN YOU GOT A BIG CHOICE TO MAKE. EAT THEM OUT OF THE BAG OR DO YOU POUR THEM INTO THE BOX? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU DON'T POUR THEM, THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.
SURE IT IS. IT'S THERE IT'S AN OPTION.
Jimmy: NO, BUT YOU'RE DOING IT. I GUESS IT IS AN OPTION THERE. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
BECAUSE THE BAG IS FLIMSY.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT IS, IT'S FLIMSY.
Jimmy: THE BAG IS FLIMSY? IT'S A BAG OF M&M'S!
I AM AN ENTHUSIASTIC FAN. THE BAG IS FLIMSY.
Jimmy: OF M&M'S?
NO, OF THE GAME THAT I'M WATCHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, THE GAME, YES, SORRY.
AND SO I AM GOING TO GET UP, I'M GOING TO CHEER, YOU GOT THE BAG THAT CAN SPILL ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU GOT THE BOX, YOU'RE SET. AND YOU DON'T LOSE AN M&M AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE AN M&M. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT ONE.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. [ APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT.
NOT ONE.
Jimmy: OKAY.
THIS IS NOT THAT HARD TO UNDERSTAND.
Jimmy: THIS IS A BAG OF M&M'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
RIGHT, SO WATCH. OPEN IT UP.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU OPEN IT UP.
ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: YEP. BAG OF M&M'S.
RIGHT?
Jimmy: YEP.
SO.
Jimmy: OPEN THE BAG OF M&M'S.
RIGHT, YOU OPEN THE BAG OF M&M'S UP.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN JUST DO THIS NUMBER.
Jimmy: AND THEN I GOT ANOTHER, I GOT A TUBE OF M&Ms.
YOU GOT A TUBE? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I ADDED THAT ONE IN THERE. A MAN OF YOUR STATURE, YOU CAN'T BE EATING OUT OF THE BOX.
LIKE THE BAG IS BETTER?
Jimmy: NO, I GOT YOU SOMETHING BETTER FOR YOU.
YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR ME?
Jimmy: YEAH, I GOT YOU A A GOLD DISH. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT'S IT SAY?.
Jimmy: CHRIS CHRISTIE'S M&M'S. KEEP THESE M&M'S. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

THANK YOU. THANK YOU, GUYS. THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IT FELT ALL RIGHT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I TRAVEL A LOT. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT EASY WHEN YOU TRAVEL A LOT. WHEN YOU FLY A BUNCH, YOU JUST THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DIE A A BUNCH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I FLY ALL THE TIME. I WAS GOING THROUGH SECURITY RECENTLY, THIS LADY IN FRONT OF ME TOLD THE TSA AGENT THAT WAS NERVOUS ABOUT STANDING IN THE X-RAY MACHINE. AND THE TSA AGENT GOES, WELL, IT'S A LOT SAFER THAN THAT PLANE YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET ON. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. LIKE WHAT. WHAT PLANE IS SHE ABOUT TO GET ON, DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT PLANE? LIKE WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? HAVE YOU EVER GOTTEN ON A A FLIGHT, AND YOU JUST LOOKED AT EVERYBODY ALREADY ON IT, IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A GROUP THAT WOULD GO DOWN IN A PLANE CRASH FOR SOME REASON? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LIKE I FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN YOU ALL BEFORE. I HAD A PILOT TELL US RIGHT BEFORE WE TAKE OFF THAT HE WAS RETIRING, AND THIS WAS HIS LAST FLIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE JUST SAY THAT WHEN WE LAND, DUDE. WE WILL BE THE SAME PEOPLE. WHY ARE YOU PUTTING THIS MUCH PRESSURE ON THIS FLIGHT. HE'S BASICALLY JUST LIKE EITHER WAY THIS IS MY LAST FLIGHT, SO [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T EVEN LIKE TO CHANGE FLIGHTS. I AM AFRAID I WOULD CHANGE INTO ONE THAT GOES DOWN. THAT WOULD BE SO FRUSTRATING. EVERYBODY IS CRYING, AND YOU'RE LIKE YOU THINK YOU'RE UPSET, I PAID $200 EXTRA TO GET ON THIS FLIGHT. YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY. [ APPLAUSE ] I WAS GOING THROUGH A SMALL AIRPORT RECENTLY, THEY JUST HAD LIKE THE METAL DETECTOR. SO WE GO THROUGH AND THE GUY IN FRONT OF ME, IT BEEPS. AND THEY ASKED HIM THEY'RE LIKE, HEY, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING METAL ON YOU? HE WAS LIKE MY KEYS. DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD DO IT? I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE ANSWER ON FAMILY FEUD OF WHAT WOULD SET OFF A A METAL DETECTOR OFF. KEYS? WE THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE HIS KNEE OR SOMETHING. HE WAS LIKE, KEYS DO YOU THINK? LET'S TRY WITHOUT IT, SEE WHAT HAPPENS. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE, YOU KNOW. IT WAS NICE TO CATCH A GUY IN A A DUMB MOMENT LIKE THAT. I'M DUMB SO, YOU KNOW, WE GELLED VERY WELL. I STARTED TALKING TO HIM, STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. SAID HE WAS A BIG FAN OF DONALD TRUMP. I WAS LIKE DUDE, SO AM I. I LOVE HIM. HE'S GREAT. HE IS THE PERFECT PRESIDENT FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME. I'VE NEVER BEEN POLITICAL IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND POLITICS, DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE PRESIDENT EFFECTS MY LIFE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DROVE HERE, I AM GOING TO DRIVE HOME AFTER, AND IT'S JUST LIKE THE GUY ON TV, DO YOU WANT TO BE A WINNER? I WOULD LOVE TO BE A WINNER. THIS GUYS THE BEST GUY I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW? IT IS LIKE AN INFOMERCIAL. YOU TIRED OF LOSING? YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU WANT TO BE A WINNER? YEAH. I WOULD LIKE TO WIN. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHEN WE'RE GOING TO WIN, BUT WE'RE GOING TO WIN A LOT. AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] HE SAID HE IS GOING TO MAKE MEXICO BUILD A WALL AND PAY FOR IT. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD USE THAT KIND OF LOGIC ON SOMETHING. I WANT A FENCE AROUND MY YARD AND I AM GOING TO MAKE MY NEIGHBOR BUILD IT AND PAY FOR IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, I WOULD NEVER HAVE THAT COURAGE IF TRUMP DIDN'T COME INTO MY LIFE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LOOK, THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THOUGH THAT COULD KEEP ME FROM VOTING FOR HIM. JUST ONE BEING LIKE HOW DO YOU VOTE. I DO NOT KNOW HOW. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN JUST SHOUT TRUMP IN THE STREET OR IF THIS COUNTS, YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF I GO TO A A BUILDING, LIKE A BANK? I HOPE IT IS A BANK, I HOPE IT IS LIKE YOU RIDE IN ONE OF THOSE TUBE THINGS THAT SHOOT UP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT SEEMS LIKE A FUN WAY TO VOTE, IT JUST SHOOTS UP, AND THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHO I AM VOTING FOR BEHIND ME, AND SO THAT'S ONE. THE OTHER THING IS JUST WHEN DO YOU VOTE? I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED, GOING TO HAPPEN. I REMEMBER TURNING 18, I WAS LIKE I CAN VOTE TODAY. THEY WERE LIKE IT IS NOT TODAY. THAT WAS THE LAST I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH! I APPRECIATE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
