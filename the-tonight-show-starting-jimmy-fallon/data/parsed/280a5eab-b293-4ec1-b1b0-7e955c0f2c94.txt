JAMES BROWN IN THE NEW BIOPIC CALLED "GET ON UP." PLEASE WELCOME A TALENTED ACTOR. SAY HELLO TO CHADWICK BOSEMAN. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. CHADWICK BOSEMAN, WELCOME TO THE SHOW, BUDDY.
MAN IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE MAN.
Jimmy: NOW EVERYTIME YOU HEAR JAMES BROWN MUSIC, IS IT HARD TO DO HIS MOVES?
YOU KNOW WHAT? YEAH, YEAH, I HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN, CLOSE DOWN, JAMES BROWN INSIDE ME.
Jimmy:  -- STARTED DANCING AROUND. EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN -- BY THE WAY, YOU WERE AMAZING IN THIS MOVIE. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU MAN. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S SO FUN. HOW WAS TARIQ?
HE WAS GREAT MAN. HE WAS GREAT.
Jimmy: THAT'S YOUR CO-STAR. YEAH, THE MOVIE, YEAH, YEAH. HE WAS GOOD TO WORK WITH?
HE WAS GREAT TO WORK WITH. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, WHAT CRAIG SAID IS TRUE.
Jimmy: YEAH, CRAIG ROBINSON WAS ON THE SHOW AND SAID THAT TARIQ WOULDN'T HANG OUT OR TALK TO ANYONE, THE CAST AT ALL. HE'S LIKE A SNOB.
I ACTUALLY --, NO. [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR. I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT HE'S JUST, NOT A NICE -- HE WOULD FLAKE ON EVERYBODY.
I ACTUALLY HAD DINNER WITH HIM ONE TIME.
Jimmy: OH YOU DID?
ONE TIME, YEAH. I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT CAUSE CRAIG DOESN'T KNOW THAT.
Jimmy: HE'S GONNA BE MAD, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, MOST OF THE TIME HE'D BE LIKE, "YEAH, YEAH, I'LL CATCH UP." AND THEN HE'D BE GONE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AS HE'S LIKE BACKING OUT OF THE ROOM. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE GUYS. HE'S A MYSTERIOUS DUDE. I MEAN, WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE, I'VE NEVER BEEN TO DINNER WITH YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, I'VE BEEN TO DINNER WITH HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES, MAYBE. HE SENDS OUT AN IMPERSONATOR TO GO EAT WITH US.
OH IS THAT RIGHT.
Jimmy: THE REAL TARIQ, YEAH. HE PUTS ON SUNGLASSES AND A A HAT. JUST LIKE JAMES FRANCO, YEAH. I THOUGHT I WAS HAVING DINNER WITH JAMES FRANCO. I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS. I SEE JACKIE ROBINSON, YOU SEE THIS MOVIE AND I GO, "OH, MY GOSH, YOU'RE AMAZING IN THAT IN JACKIE ROBINSON." AND THEN I SEE JAMES BROWN, I GO, "THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. I CAN BE THE BELIEVE THIS IS THE SAME GUY DOING BOTH OF THESE, BECAUSE THEY'RE TOTALLY DIFFERENT HUMANS." DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY COULD BE A JAMES BROWN CHARACTER -- YOU COULD BE JACKIE ROBINSON.
NO, NO, NO. WHEN I FIRST SAW THE SCRIPT, I WAS, LIKE, "AIN'T NO WAY IN THE WORLD I'M TRYING THAT." JUST BECAUSE, IT WAS JUST, LIKE, JAMES BROWN, TO PARODY JAMES BROWN. AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM AT THAT MOUNT IN TIME. I HAVE SEEN GREAT PERFORMANCES, BUT I DIDN'T GET THE WHOLE SCOPE OF HIS SOCIAL RELEVENCE AND HIS POLITICAL RELEVENCE. I KNEW SOME OF THE SONGS, BUT NOT ALL OF THEM. BUT NOW IT'S LIKE, I'M A A JAMES BROWN FANATIC, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: OH ABSOLUTELY. YOU'D HAVE TO BE. BUT I MEAN, THEY GOT THE RIGHTS TO THE MUSIC, THE REAL MUSIC. SOME OF THESE MOVIES COME OUT AND THEY GO, "THIS IS A MOVIE, IT'S ABOUT THE BEATLES, BUT WE COULDN'T AFFORD ANY OF THE BEATLES SONGS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO THEY'RE SINGING -- THEY'RE SINGING HANSON. SO IT'S THE BEATLES, WE'VE GOT "MMM BOP," WE'VE GOT "MMM BOP," BUT IT'S PAUL AND GEORGE AND RINGO SINGING "MMM BOP." YOU GO, "OKAY, I GUESS I COULD PUT MY HEAD AROUND THAT." THE FAMILY WAS SO INVOLVED IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND THEY WANTED IT TO HAPPEN.
Jimmy: MICK JAGGER IS A A PRODUCER, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. THEY CAME IN AND MICK, OF COURSE LOVES JAMES BROWN. KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS. HE IMITATED A LOT OF HIS -- WELL HE WAS INSPIRED BY A LOT OF HIS MOVES.
HE WOULD SIT AT THE APOLLO AND WATCH HIM, YOU KNOW, SHOW AFTER SHOW AND THEN HE WOULD GO BACKSTAGE AND MEET HIM. AND THEN THE TAMI SHOW INCIDENT IS DEPICTED IN THE MOVIE OF COURSE WHERE THE STONES HAVE TO GO ON AFTER JAMES BROWN.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANNA FOLLOW JAMES BROWN. WELL, YOU DID A GREAT JOB. YOU WOULD MAKE ANY FAN OF JAMES BROWN PROUD. YOU MADE THE FAMILY PROUD BY DOING THAT THING. IT'S A GOOD -- YOU DID A GOOD JOB WITH THIS MOVIE.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I WANNA SHOW EVERYONE -- HERE'S A CLIP -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CHADWICK BOSEMAN PERFORMING AS JAMES BROWN IN "GET ON UP" IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. CHECK IT OUT.
