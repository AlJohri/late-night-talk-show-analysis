Questlove: 607, NEW YORK! YEAH!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH! I LOVE YOU! THAT'S A HOT CROWD, RIGHT THERE. WELCOME EVERYBODY, WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. GOOD LOOKING CROWD. I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST JIMMY FALLON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DID IT. YOU MADE IT, YOU MADE IT.
I LOVE YOU, JIMMY!
Jimmy: I LOVE YOU, TOO. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, TODAY DONALD TRUMP WAS SWORN IN AS THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. NOW, SOME PEOPLE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOME PEOPLE WATCHED IT ON TV. SOME PEOPLE WATCHED IT ON THE INTERNET AND MANY PEOPLE WATCHED IT LIKE THIS -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AT THE CEREMONY TRUMP REPEATED EACH LINE OF THE OATH AFTER CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS SAID IT AND TRUMP WAS LIKE, "WAIT. NOW, WHO'S PRESIDENT? YOU OR ME? ARE WE BOTH? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT JUST HAPPENED?" AND MAYBE IT WAS JUST ME BUT WHILE TRUMP WAS TAKING THE OATH I NOTICED SOMETHING ABOUT HIS RIGHT HAND, AS THE OATH WENT ON. SEE IF YOU CAN NOTICE THIS. WATCH THIS.
PLEASE RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND AND REPEAT AFTER ME. I, DONALD JOHN TRUMP DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR.
I DONALD JOHN TRUMP DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR.
THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE.
THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?
Steve: I SEE IT, HIS HANDS ARE TOO TINY.
Jimmy: DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE? I DON'T KNOW.
Steve: I SAW THAT. I SAW THAT WITH MY OWN EYES.
Jimmy: IN HIS DEFENSE, IT WAS VERY COLD OUT. IT WAS VERY COLD OUT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: YEAH, VERY -- VERY CHILLY. VERY CHILLY.
Jimmy: GUYS, LISTEN TO THIS. I READ THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD TO GIVE UP HIS OLD CELL PHONE AND SWITCH TO A NEW PHONE, ISSUE TO HIM BY THE SECRET SERVICE. WHICH IS WHY TODAY TRUMP ANSWERED HIS PHONE BY SAYING, "NEW PRESIDENT, WHO DIS?" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] RING RING. NEW PRESIDENT, WHO DIS? THIS IS PRETTY, BIG. TODAY, HILLARY CLINTON ATTENDED DONALD TRUMP'S SWEARING IN. IN FACT, SHE DID MOST OF THE SWEARING. AND, UH -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAPPENED HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. TWO OF OUR TABLOID NEWSPAPERS, THE "NEW YORK POST" AND THE "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS" ENDED UP USING THE EXACT SAME PUN HEADLINE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. DON OF A NEW DAY. THEY BOTH USED IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THEY BOTH HAD TO USE THE SAME PUN HEADLINE WHEN THERE'S SO MANY AVAILABLE. I MEAN, FOR INSTANCE. THE "POST" COULD HAVE GONE WITH "HAIR FORCE ONE." I MEAN -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S NOT BAD. "DAILY NEWS" COULD'VE GONE WITH, "ORANGE YOU GLAD YOU VOTED FOR GARY JOHNSON?" [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? THERE WERE OPTIONS THAT THEY COULD HAVE WENT WITH. THEY LIKE IT. I HEARD THAT ONLY ABOUT 10,000 PEOPLE WENT TO DONALD TRUMP'S INAUGURATION CONCERT LAST NIGHT. MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE, BUT WHEN SHOWED UP THEY WERE TOLD THE CONCERT WAS THREE DOORS DOWN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT.
Steve: HEY, OH!
Jimmy: THAT WAS FOR THE KIDS. [ RIM SHOT ]
Steve: COME ON!
Jimmy: AH --
Steve: FOR THE KIDS.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE TRUMP MOVING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. HIS NEIGHBORS BACK HERE IN NEW YORK AT TRUMP TOWER. [ APPLAUSE ] HERE'S WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. THIS TRUMP TOWER RESIDENT SAID "AS SOON AS DONALD'S MOVING TRUCK PULLED AWAY I DID THE WORM FOR TWO STRAIGHT HOURS." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A LOT OF WORMING.
Steve: THAT'S A LOT OF WORMING.
Jimmy: YEAH. THIS ONE SAID, "FOR 19 YEARS I PRETENDED LIKE I DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO TALK TO HIM IN THE ELEVATOR." [ LAUGHTER ] NO HABLA INGLES. AND, FINALLY, THIS DOG SAID, "OH THANK GOD, EVERY TIME HE WALKED BY, HIS HAIR WOULD GROWL AT ME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ GROWL ] THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. BUT I SAW THAT, ACCORDING TO A A NEW REPORT, THE MOST COMMON PASSWORD IN 2016 WAS 123456. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH. AND WE'RE STILL WONDERING HOW THE RUSSIANS MANAGED TO HACK US. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU REALLY -- IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, TRY PASSWORD. FINALLY, SOME GOOD NEWS, YOU GUYS. THIS WEEK, NBC ANNOUNCED THAT "WILL & GRACE" WILL RETURN FOR TEN EPISODES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT I READ THAT THE APARTMENT WHERE WILL AND GRACE LIVED WOULD COST OVER $6,500 A MONTH WITH TODAY'S RENT PRICES. YEAH, WHICH EXPLAINS THE SHOW'S NEW TITLE, "WILL AND GRACE AND JEFF AND PETE AND MARK AND JENNIFER AND KATIE." THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO COVER IT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE IS A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. WE DO! GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING TODAY. TODAY WAS THE INAUGURATION. IT WAS A BIG DAY TODAY. I WAS WATCHING IT ON TV AND OUR WHOLE OFFICE WAS. IT WAS AN HISTORIC DAY, BUT ALSO KIND OF A WEIRD DAY. KIND OF AN ODD DAY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ANY OF US COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT A YEAR AGO DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE OUR PRESIDENT. SO IT'S BEEN A LOT OF MIXED EMOTIONS TODAY. DEMOCRATS ARE ANGRY AT TRUMP. TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE ANGRY AT PROTESTORS. EVERYBODY'S ANGRY AT THREE DOORS DOWN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: TRUE. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY.
Jimmy: BUT I THINK THE MOST ENCOURAGING THING I SAW TODAY, IT WAS GREAT, WAS SEEING BARACK OBAMA SHAKE HANDS WITH DONALD TRUMP. I THOUGHT THAT WAS SETTING A A GOOD EXAMPLE, AND SETTING A A GOOD EXAMPLE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS GOOD! SETTING THE EXAMPLE, THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT WE ALL WANT IS, WE WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THIS COUNTRY. WE MAY DISAGREE ON HOW WE GET THERE. BUT WE ALL WANT TO BE SAFE, AND HEALTHY, AND PEACEFUL. AND, I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE ALL DO. I WAS THINKING I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AND I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO ANYTHING FOR THEM. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH AND I WANT THEM TO GROW UP, BEING FREE AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE CHOICES. AND HAVE OPINIONS. WE LIVE IN A GREAT COUNTRY WHERE WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS. AND THAT'S OKAY. IT'S FINE TO HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS. YOU CAN DO THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS OUR COUNTRY, IT'S AN AMAZING THING. [ APPLAUSE ] I JUST HOPE THAT THIS WEEKEND WILL BE PEACEFUL AND THAT WE CAN TELL EACH OTHER HOW WE FEEL, BUT ALSO LISTEN TO EACH OTHER. LISTEN TO EACH OTHER.

ANYWAY, I'VE NEVER GOTTEN USED TO MORNINGS. SO MORNINGS, I ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE AN 8:00 CLASS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WELL I WAS GOING TO -- AT THE TIME I WAS GOING TO A BOARDING SCHOOL, SO, YOU KNOW, 8:00 CLASS, I MISSED A LOT OF THOSE. I WOULD GO AND HAVE BREAKFAST AT THE CAFETERIA, BUT I WOULD, YOU KNOW, BREAKFAST FOR ME IT WAS OFTEN JUST SORT OF MEETING UP WITH MY PALS AND SORT OF CHATTING ABOUT THIS AND THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE.
YOU MIGHT GET TO AROUND TO A A LITTLE BIT OF EATING. BY 12:15 I WAS EXHAUSTED, SO I SLEPT THROUGH THE CLASSES, A A LOT OF THEM. AND SHE WAS SO DEAR, BARBARA HOLT, SHE WAS SO NICE. SHE'D LET ME MAKE UP STUFF AND YOU KNOW MAKE UP TESTS AND THINGS LIKE, SHE WAS VERY DEAR AND I WAS ALWAYS VERY, VERY SWEET WITH ADULTS AND I WAS SORT OF A NERDY [ BLEEP ]. I WAS ALWAYS VERY SWEET WITH ADULTS AND, YOU KNOW, VERY RESPECTFUL AND SO ON AND SO FORTH, BUT I WOULD MISS THE CLASS.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND THEY WERE JUST COOL WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'D GO, "OH, IT'S JUST JAMES, WE'RE BUDDIES WITH JAMES."
WELL, YEAH, YEAH, NO, AND I WAS -- YOU KNOW, I WOULD SHOW UP, I'D MAKE AN EFFORT TO FIND HER, YOU KNOW, AND APOLOGIZE. I REALLY WANT TO MAKE IT UP AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. AND IT WASN'T DISINGENUOUS. I REALLY -- I FELT REMORSE OF A A SORT. BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IN ANY CASE.
Jimmy: YOU WERE A NICE GUY, YOU WERE VERY POLITE.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH. EXCEPT MISSING CLASSES, YEAH.
EXCEPT FOR THE MISSING OF THE CLASSES. RIGHT. AND THEN I WOULD, SO A LOT OF THE CLASSES THAT I WOULD GO TO, I SLEPT THROUGH THEM.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT SHE -- I, ALL OF A A SUDDEN I GOT, LIKE, A A TERM-END REPORT, AND IT -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT SAID, JAMES HAS SLEPT THROUGH A MAJORITY OF THE CLASSES THIS TERM. BUT WE'RE THANKFUL FOR THAT CONSIDERING HIS BEHAVIOR WHEN HE'S AWAKE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC! YEAH. I COULD TALK TO YOU FOR 100 HOURS YOU KNOW I LOVE HAVING YOU ON. BUT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT "THE BLACKLIST." WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS SEASON, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR CHARACTER?
HE'S IN A -- HE'S LIKE DRIVING FAST RIGHT TOWARDS A A CLIFF, IT FEELS LIKE.

Jimmy: YEAH.
VERY ISOLATED. REALLY, IT'S A VERY STRANGE PLACE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW, BUT -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE ALWAYS LOVE HAVING YOU HERE.
YEAH.
YOU'VE BEEN HERE A BUNCH OF TIMES ON OUR SHOW. I THINK EVEN BACK IN -- IN "LATE NIGHT" MAYBE -- DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE HERE?
2011.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH, AND I WAS PLAYING WITH THE ROOTS. AND FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S A A DREAM COME TRUE, AND IT'S TIGHT THAT YOU DO THAT FOR ARTISTS, BECAUSE I THINK EVERY ARTIST IS LIKE, TO HAVE THE ROOTS AS THEIR BAND. YOU KNOW, THAT'S LIKE A GOAL. SO, I HAD THAT FOR ONE NIGHT. BUT I REMEMBER, 2011, IN BETWEEN THE COMMERCIAL BREAKS I WAS PLAYING LIKE SONGS OFF MY FIRST ALBUM. THAT WAS MY FIRST ALBUM DROP, SO THAT WAS SUCH A BIG MOMENT FOR ME. AND THEN TO COME -- AND THEN I -- YOU INVITED ME BACK AGAIN TO PERFORM LATER THAT YEAR, SO.
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
IT'S JUST GREAT TIMES.
Jimmy: THIS IS FANTASTIC. AND NOW HERE YOU ARE ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."
YES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. WE LOVE YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU. IT'S MAJOR.
Jimmy: HAVE YOU BEEN TO "SNL" BEFORE?
I'VE BEEN TO "SNL," BUT THIS IS MY FIRST TIME BEING THE MUSICAL GUEST. I REMEMBER GOING BACK THERE WITH KANYE, 'CAUSE I'M SIGNED TO KANYE. SO, IN 2010 HE WAS PERFORMING THERE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I JUST REMEMBER NOBODY -- OBVIOUSLY, NOBODY KNEW WHO I WAS. THIS WAS BEFORE I PUT MY ALBUM OUT, BUT I JUST REMEMBER LOOKING AROUND, AND EQUATING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" WITH A A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SUCCESS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
KANYE, OBVIOUSLY, NOT JUST A A MENTOR, BUT HE'S ALSO MY FAVORITE ARTIST. YOU KNOW? SO, YOU COULD JUST IMAGINE WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE, TO COME BACK AND IT'S LIKE, OKAY. I MADE IT TO "SNL" ON MY OWN. YOU KNOW? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IS YOUR MOM HERE?
YEAH, SHE'S BACK THERE. YEAH.
Jimmy: YOUR -- YOUR MOM'S GOING TO BE HERE THIS WEEKEND? WATCHING THE SHOW?
SHE'S WATCHING IT RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO COOL. HI, MOM! YEAH, THAT'S AWESOME.
YOU ARE -- YOU ARE FUNNY.
Jimmy: NO! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
YOU ARE FUNNY, YOU ARE FUNNY.
Jimmy: HEY, I ALWAYS MAKE YOU DO THIS -- THIS STORY. BUT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE STORY ABOUT HOW YOU MET KANYE. I THINK IT'S A GREAT STORY. AND YOU PROBABLY -- THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME YOU HAVE TO TELL IT. I PROMISE.
ALL RIGHT, UH.
Jimmy: PLEASE, PLEASE, I LOVE IT. IT'S -- IT'S A GOOD STORY.
NO, IT'S LIKE THE RAP FAIRY TALE. SO, BASICALLY -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M FROM DETROIT, SO I USED TO DO A RADIO SHOW IN DETROIT. SHOUT OUT TO THE D! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I USED TO DO A RADIO SHOW EVERY FRIDAY, AT THE RADIO STATION WHERE EMCEES WOULD BATTLE EACH OTHER, AND THEN WHOEVER WOULD WIN THAT, WOULD GET TO RAP ON AIR. SO, I DID THAT EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL. MY MOM WOULD BE LIKE, COME HOME -- JUST COME STRAIGHT HOME, AND I WOULD STILL GO THERE. YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: 'CAUSE YOU HAD TO DO IT.
I HAD TO DO IT SO BAD. WHAT THAT DID, WAS THAT TAUGHT ME -- THAT BUILT A RELATIONSHIP FOR ME AT THE RADIO STATION, AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO RAP UNDER PRESSURE. SO ONE DAY KANYE WAS -- SOMEBODY'S CALLING ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU FORGOT TO TURN YOUR RINGER OFF.
ANYWAY -- HOLD ON A SECOND.
Jimmy: WAIT A SECOND. ARE YOU GOING TO GET IT?
NO. I'M NOT GOING TO GET IT. IT'S OKAY. THEY CAN KEEP CALLING. SO ANYWAY, KANYE --
Jimmy: BUT IF IT'S KANYE, HE CAN JUST TELL THE STORY HIMSELF. [ LAUGHTER ]
EXACTLY. EXACTLY. SO, ANYWAY -- TO FINISH THE STORY, SO KANYE WAS THERE, DOING RADIO PROMOTION ONE DAY, AND I -- SINCE I HAD CONNECTIONS AT THE RADIO STATION, I WAS ABLE TO GET IN. IT WAS THE DAY AFTER THE CIPHER, ON A SATURDAY. I LIED AND SAID I LEFT MY CELL PHONE IN THE BACK. YOU KNOW, SO I --
Jimmy: WE ALL KNOW IF YOU KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS.
YEAH, I KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I -- SO I FINESSED MY WAY BACK THERE AND I GOT A CHANCE TO RAP FOR KANYE AS HE WAS WALKING OUT MAN LIKE --
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU JUST DO THAT THOUGH? YOU JUST GO -- AND JUST START RAPPING? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WELL, YEAH AND HE -- AT FIRST, YOU KNOW, HE WAS -- HE WAS IN A RUSH. HE WAS RUNNING LATE SOMEWHERE. BUT THEN I LIKE GAVE HIM THIS SUPER GUILT TRIP. I WAS LIKE, MAN, I LISTEN TO "COLLEGE DROPOUT" ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL. IT'S MY FAVORITE ALBUM. HE WAS LIKE, OKAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, HE GAVE ME 16 BARS. HE'S A GREAT GUY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
ANYBODY -- YEAH, SO HE GAVE -- HE SAID YOU HAVE 16 BARS. I ENDED UP RAPPING FOR LIKE TEN MINUTES STRAIGHT. AND HE JUST -- HE ENDED UP -- HE SAW THE POTENTIAL AND, YOU KNOW, IT TOOK A COUPLE YEARS AFTER THAT, BUT THAT WAS THE INITIAL MEETING POINT AND TWO YEARS LATER I WAS SIGNED TO HIM. SO, AMAZING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AND NOW HERE YOU ARE. FEBRUARY 3RD, IS THE NEW ALBUM RIGHT?
FEBRUARY 3rd IS THE NEW ALBUM. I'M EXCITED.
Jimmy: I LOVE -- I LOVE THE COVER. NOW, EXPLAIN TO ME THE COVER, 'CAUSE I SEE THE COVER, THIS IS LIKE -- THIS IS YOU, AND THIS IS YOUR NEIGHBOR?
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND HE'S LIKE --
NO. SO ACTUALLY, WHAT'S -- WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS ALBUM --
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THIS LATE? [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, I'M LOOKING AT THE LIGHTS. LIKE, OH, ME TOO.
WELL, ACTUALLY, SO I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. SO -- THE -- THE CONCEPT OF THE ALBUM, THIS IS ME AND THIS IS THE OLDER VERSION OF ME. AND IT'S PARALLEL RIGHT THERE, WITH EACH OTHER. BUT THE NAME OF THE ALBUM IS CALLED "I DECIDED." I REALIZED MY WHOLE LIFE CHANGED WHEN I DECIDED, I FEEL LIFE IS ABOUT MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS AT ANY -- ANY POINT. OR THE WRONG DECISIONS. SO IMAGINE, THE STORY OF THE ALBUM IS IMAGINE YOU GOING THROUGH LIFE, AND YOU MADE ALL THE WRONG DECISIONS YOUR WHOLE LIFE. YOU GET TO THE END OF YOUR LIFE, AND YOU KNOW, YOU'RE AT A A MOMENT, WHERE IT'S LIKE, GOD, I DID EVERYTHING WRONG. I DIDN'T WORK IT OUT WITH THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. I MESSED IT UP WITH MY PARENTS. I'M NOT DOING THE JOB I -- I WAS SENT HERE TO DO ON EARTH. SO, THEN IMAGINE SOMETHING HAPPENS AND YOU GET ONE CHANCE TO RE-DO IT ALL. SO THE -- THE ALBUM IS BASICALLY A CHANCE OF, LIKE, HAVING THAT WISDOM OF A OLD MAN WHILE YOU'RE YOUNG, AND GOING THROUGH LIFE AND FIGURING IT OUT. SO, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BIG SEAN.
