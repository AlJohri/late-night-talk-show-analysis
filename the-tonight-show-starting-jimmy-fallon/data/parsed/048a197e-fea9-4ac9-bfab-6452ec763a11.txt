Questlove: 502, LOUISVILLE!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, PLEASE, CONTROL YOURSELVES. SIT DOWN, RELAX. WELCOME, EVERYBODY, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. IT'S A HOT SHOW TONIGHT. OH, MY GOSH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CHRIS PINE, JOANNA LUMLEY, TROYE SIVAN. GUYS, MY NAME'S JIMMY FALLON, I'M THE HOST, AND WELCOME, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY IS THAT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION STARTED TODAY, AND WE'RE ACTUALLY JUST A WEEK AWAY FROM THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. BOTH HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT CASE TO MAKE. WHO WOULD BE BETTER AT CREATING PEACE BETWEEN KIM KARDASHIAN AND TAYLOR SWIFT. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, SOMEONE'S GOTTA DO IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OUR COUNTRY IS BETTER THAN THIS, GUYS.
Steve: GOTTA DO IT.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION STARTED TODAY. DONALD TRUMP SPENT THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS PREPARING HIS ACCEPTANCE SPEECH, WHILE CHRIS CHRISTIE SPENT THE PAST TWO WEEKS BLOWING UP BALLOONS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. I READ THAT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IS BANNING 72 ITEMS FROM THE EVENT, INCLUDING TENNIS BALLS AND LASERS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OR AS DOGS AND CATS PUT IT, "GO HILLARY." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BALLS AND LASERS, THAT'S MY JAM. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP INTRODUCED MIKE PENCE AS HIS RUNNING MATE ON SATURDAY IN NEW YORK CITY. AND AFTERWARDS, PENCE TWEETED THIS PHOTO OF HIMSELF, ENJOYING A QUICK DINNER WITH THE FAMILY AT CHILI'S. [ LAUGHTER ] YEP. THAT'S WHERE HE DECIDED TO GO DURING HIS TRIP TO NEW YORK CITY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHERE HE WENT. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S OKAY, BECAUSE PENCE MANAGED TO DO A LOT OF OTHER STUFF WHILE HE WAS HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. CHECK OUT WHAT ELSE PENCE SAID HE DID. FIRST, HE TWEETED, "WANTED TO SEE NEW YORK FASHION, SO I STOPPED BY THE GAP ON 34TH." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELL, HE'S IN NEW YORK.
Steve: YOU GOT TO WHEN YOU'RE IN NEW YORK.
Jimmy: THEN HE TWEETED, "ORDERING A FAMOUS NEW YORK CITY HOT DOG AT BURGER KING." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: OH. [ KISSING NOISE ]
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, "JUST WENT TO CHINATOWN, BUT COULDN'T FIND A PANDA EXPRESS. SAD." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SAD. SO SAD. LAST NIGHT, TRUMP AND PENCE ACTUALLY SAT DOWN FOR A JOINT INTERVIEW ON "60 MINUTES." DID YOU SEE THIS? MAN, IT'S FANTASTIC. PENCE SAID THAT IF HE HAS DIFFERENCES WITH DONALD TRUMP, HE WOULD, QUOTE, "WALK INTO THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE, CLOSE THE DOOR, AND SHARE HIS HEART." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EVEN GUYS IN THE BACHELORETTE WERE, LIKE, "GROSS." [ LAUGHTER ] SHARE YOUR HEART? ACTUALLY, KIND OF SEEMS LIKE TRUMP AND PENCE DIDN'T AGREE ON EVERYTHING DURING THE INTERVIEW. LISTEN TO THIS.
HE SPEAKS FROM HIS HEART, AND --
WELL, I SPEAK FROM MY HEART AND MY BRAIN, JUST SO WE UNDERSTAND. PEOPLE SPEAK FROM THEIR HEART.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS MAYBE MORE IMPORTANT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "MOSTLY, I SPEAK FROM THE MOUTH. THE MOUTH KEEPS GOING, EVEN WHEN I'M SLEEPING. I SPEAK FROM THE MOUTH." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY EVENTUALLY FOUND SOME COMMON GROUND, THOUGH. CHECK THIS OUT.
THIS MAN IS AWED WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND HE'S NOT INTIMIDATED BY THE WORLD. AND DONALD TRUMP, THIS GOOD MAN, I BELIEVE, WILL BE A GREAT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
I LOVE WHAT HE JUST SAID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH WHAT I TOLD YOU TO SAY. THAT'S RIGHT." [ LAUGHTER ] BY THE WAY, IT TURNS OUT, THAT WASN'T -- THAT TICKING CLOCK WASN'T "60 MINUTES," THAT WAS FOR CIVILIZATION.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WOW, I DID NOT KNOW THAT.
Jimmy: OVER ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, BERNIE SANDERS GAVE A 23 MINUTE SPEECH AT A A CONFERENCE LAST WEEK AFTER HE ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON, BUT HE DIDN'T MENTION HER BY NAME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO PEOPLE HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHO HE WAS REFERRING TO WHEN HE MENTIONED MONEYBAGS McPANTSUIT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WELL, GUYS, THE OLYMPICS ARE JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AWAY, AND I READ A 94-YEAR-OLD TRACK COACH FOR NEW ZEALAND WILL BE ATTENDING THIS YEAR'S GAMES. WHICH MAKES THE MOST SUSPENSEFUL PART OF EVERY RACE THE STARTING GUN. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] "HE'S OKAY, EVERYBODY, HE'S OKAY. YOU CAN START RUNNING. GO, HE'S FINE." [ APPLAUSE ] YOU SEE THIS? U.S. OLYMPIC SWIMMER, NATHAN ADRIAN, SAYS HE EATS FIVE TO SIX FULL MEALS A DAY, AND ON PRACTICE DAYS, HE HAS BREAKFAST TWICE. LET'S SEE A PICTURE OF THIS YEAR'S TEAM. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK WE KNOW WHICH ONE -- NATHAN IS THERE. HE'S RIGHT THERE. [ APPLAUSE ] AND, FINALLY, I SAW THAT LAST WEEK WAS THE 27TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLASSIC ROMANTIC COMEDY "WHEN HARRY MET SALLY." [ CHEERS ] THE MOVIE FEATURES INTERVIEWS -- I KNOW, WE LOVE IT. THE MOVIE HAS INTERVIEWS WITH COUPLES TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY MET, AND APPARENTLY FOR THE ANNIVERSARY, THEY RELEASED A A NEW EDITION THAT FEATURES A A NEW COUPLE. IT'S VERY SWEET. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WE FELL IN LOVE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

AND TO THINK THAT ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, IN THIS BUSINESS HAS LASTED THAT LONG WITH SUCH A A CONSIDERABLE FAN BASE, I THINK IS SAYING SOMETHING. TRYING TO KIND OF REASON WHY THAT IS, I THINK, FUNDAMENTALLY GENE RODDENBERRY, THE GUY THAT CREATED THE SERIES, ENVISIONED THIS WORLD THAT WAS BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE. IT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER. IN THE ORIGINAL SHOW IT WAS A A RUSSIAN, AND THAT ASIAN GUY, YOU HAVE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN, THERE WAS THE FIRST INTERRACIAL KISS ON "STAR TREK" IN 1968, IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT. THE HEIGHT OF CIVIL DISTURBANCE HERE, AND SO 50 YEARS ON WE KIND OF REINVESTIGATE THE NEED FOR FAMILY, THE NEED FOR FEDERATION, THE NEED FOR STRENGTH AND UNITY, AND OBVIOUSLY AS WE UNFORTUNATELY SEE IN OUR WORLD RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S GERMANE AND APROPOS MESSAGE FOR RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS, WE WORK BETTER WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER.

Jimmy: COME ON! I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S SUCH A THRILL FOR ME.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH, I'M FREAKING OUT. I LOVED THE MOVIE, TOLD YOU ALREADY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT -- FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET, WELL, YOU HAVE NOT BECAUSE IT'S COMING OUT FRIDAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] UNLESS YOU'RE FROM THE FUTURE, WHICH, I DON'T KNOW, MIGHT HAVE TIME TRAVELED AND SEEN THE FILM, AND IF YOU HAD, YOU ENJOYED IT. BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO EXCITING FOR -- IN ENGLAND IT WAS LIKE THE BIGGEST --
OH, IT WAS HUGE, IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY. IT'S REALLY STRANGE, WHEN YOU'VE BEEN DOING A TELEVISION PROGRAM FOR OVER A PERIOD OF 25 YEARS, 25 YEARS -- AND NOW 110, AND MAYBE IT JUST LET IT DRIFT BY, IT WAS HUGE. WE HAD TO OPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY IN TWO THEATERS. IN LONDON, LEICESTER SQUARE. WE HAD GOLD CARPETS. THE CITY CAME TO A STANDSTILL. IT WAS FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: I MEAN IT IS WORTH IT. I'M SO HAPPY. YOU GOT TO SEE IT, AND RIGHT NOW IS THE BEST TIME -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE NEED FUNNY. WE NEED FUNNY IN THIS WORLD RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING FUNNY.
YOU ARE SWEET, JIMMY.
Jimmy: DOES EVERYONE -- CAN I OFFER YOU SOME CHAMPAGNE, DARLING?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? OH, WOW. THIS BOY IS A CLAIRVOYANT.
Jimmy: DOES EVERYONE OFFER YOU CHAMPAGNE?
WELL THE GREAT THING ABOUT IT IS, THAT TWO THINGS, ONE, IS THAT THE TITLE OF THE SHOW IS "ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS," WHAT IF IT HAD BEEN "FAIRLY INDIFFERENT?" [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE PEOPLE TEND TO SAY YOU'RE ABSOLUTLEY FABULOUS, AND THEN BECAUSE WE DRINK A LOT OF CHAMPAGNE, PEOPLE SAY, OH, YOU AND JENNIFER, YOU MUST SURELY WANT CHAMPAGNE. AND WE JUST SAY, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY, OF COURSE.
CHEERS, SWEETIE. CHEERS SWEETIE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: CHEERS SWEETIE.
MM, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
Jimmy: I USED TO WATCH THE SHOW. IT AIRED ON COMEDY CENTRAL HERE IN THE U.S.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I USED TO WATCH IT ALL THE TIME. MY SISTER WAS SO INTO IT. SHE USED TO HAVE AB FAB PARTIES -- AND YEAH AND LIKE ALL THE TIME. LIKE, HER FRIENDS, LEODY IF YOU'RE WATCHING, THEY USED TO DRESS UP AS YOU GUYS, AND I WOULD JUST BE A FAN. I WOULDN'T DRESS UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THAT'S SO NICE, BECAUSE THAT'S HOW PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO SEE THE FILM IN BRITAIN AT THE MOMENT, THEY GO DRESS UP, AS PATSY AND EDIE AND THEY HAVE -- THEY GO IN GREAT BIG GANGS. THEY GO 50 OF THEM. THEY TAKE A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE. IT'S JUST FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: YOU SHOULD HAVE A CHAMPAGNE PARTY AND WATCH THIS FILM.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HONESTLY WORTH AND SAFFY -- OH IT'S MY GIRL, I LOVE HER.
BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE NOT SEEN IT, JUST IN CASE. PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT. IT'S ABOUT A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY, A REALLY STRONG FRIENDSHIP, AND SOME PRETTY BAD BEHAVIOR. IT'S FINE, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: GUYS, IN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES, THERE'S SO MUCH PHYSICAL COMEDY WITH YOU GUYS ROLLING OUT OF BENTLEYS, COMING HOME FROM A PARTY AT SUNSET -- SUNRISE, SORRY, SUNRISE AND YOU BOTH ARE ROLLING OUT OF THE BENTLEY, FALLING TWO STORIES. YOU'RE BOTH LIKE ALL HUNG OVER IN THE BATHROOM, AND I'M NOT SPOILING ANYTHING, YOU'LL SEE HOW FUNNY IT IS, BUT SHE'S LIKE TALKING TO EACH OTHER, AND YOU'RE GOING UP TO THE BATHROOM, AND USUALLY PEOPLE BE BRUSHING THEIR TEETH IN THE MORNING WHATEVER, YOU'RE INJECTING YOURSELF WITH BOTOX. [ LAUGHTER ]
PATSY'S SHE'S HAD MOST OF HER INTERIOR ORGANS REMOVED. [ LAUGHTER ] TO START THE DAY SHE HAS LOTS OF NEEDLES, LOTS OF BOTOX GOES IN THE FACE AND SHE SORT OF HOOVERS HERSELF UP WITH SOME SUCTION MACHINE, TAKES A LOT OF PILLS, AND THEN SHE'S YEA, READY FOR THE DAY.
Jimmy: READY FOR THE DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE THE CHARACTERS OF THESE TWO -- THESE TWO WOMEN?
WELL, ONE IS A P.R., AND THAT'S JENNIFER SAUNDERS, AND ONE IS A KIND OF -- SHE'S A FASHION EDITOR, BUT I MEAN, SHE'S REALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL. THEY ARE BOTH ABSOLUTELY USELESS AT WHAT THEY DO. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEY LIKE EACH OTHER A LOT, AND IN THE FILM, THEY ARE DESPERATE, BECAUSE EDINA'S P.R. AGENCY IS BEGINNING TO GO DOWN HILL. THEY GOT NO MORE MONEY. THEY HEAR THAT KATE MOSS, THE GREATEST MODEL IN THE WORLD, HAS SACKED HER P.R. AND SHE THINKS "I COULD BE THAT P.R. FOR HER."
Jimmy: SHE'S TRYING TO SIGN -- SHE WANTS TO SIGN KATE MOSS. ALSO LOOKING FOR A BOOK DEAL WHICH AT RANDOM PENGUIN --
RANDOM PENGUIN.
Jimmy: RANDOM PENGUIN BOOK PUBLISHING. AND SO SHE GOES -- SO SHE THEY ARE TRYING TO SIGN -- I'M NOT SPOILING ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S IN THE TRAILER.
SURE.
Jimmy: YOU GO INTO TO SIGN -- THEY GO TO THIS FASHION PARTY, AND EVERY CAMEO YOU CAN THINK OF IS. STELLA McCARTNEY IS HILARIOUS.
YES.
Jimmy: JOHN HAMM.
WE'VE GOT REBEL WILSON. WE GOT JOHN HAMM. LISTEN, MY FRIENDS, I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU, I JUST HAVE A FEW THINGS WRITTEN INTO MY CONTRACT, AND JOHN HAMM IS ONE OF THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AS HE SHOULD BE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S A STUD. YEAH. AND HE'S FUNNY AS WELL.
HE'S SO FUNNY. HE'S SO SWEET. AND IT'S ONLY A TINY MOMENT, BUT HE WAS REALLY GENEROUS, HE JUST FLEW IN, HE HAD ONLY A COUPLE DAYS TO SPARE. WE JUST DID IT, WE TAILORED A LITTLE LOVELY PIECE FOR HIM.
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU GET KATE MOSS TO DO THIS? I'VE NEVER SEEN HER DO ANYTHING COMEDIC AT ALL.
SHE DOESN'T. AND THE THING IS, JENNIFER MY BEAUTIFUL JENNIFER SAUNDERS MY FRIEND WHO PLAYS EDINA, SHE ALSO WRITES A SERIES. AND SHE HAD THIS IDEA AND SHE SAID WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY, IF THEY KILLED KATE MOSS. THAT WOULD BE A FUNNY STORY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT WOULD BE GREAT. SO SHE WROTE THIS FILM AND SHE SOLD IT TO FOX AND FOX SAID, THIS IS GREAT AND WHAT DOES KATE THINK ABOUT IT? AND SHE WENT, "OH, KATE, I FORGOT TO ASK HER." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH YOU SHOULD ASK KATE MOSS IF SHE WANTS -- BASICALLY THE WHOLE PLOT OF THE MOVIE.
SENT SOME SCRIPTS AND KATE JUST SAID, YEAH, IT'S COOL. 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT KATE'S LIKE.
Jimmy: SO SHE GOES AND MEETS KATE, YOU GUYS BUST INTO THIS PARTY TO TRY TO SIGN KATE MOSS AND SHE'S SITTING ON THIS BRIDGE LIKE, SMOKING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
JUST SITTING ON -- ON A PARAPET WHICH OVERLOOKS THE RIVER THAMES IN LONDON, AND EDINA RUSHING TOWARDS HER TO TRY TO EMBRACE HER, KNOCKS HER BACKWARDS INTO THE RIVER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PUSHING KATE MOSS INTO THE THAMES AND KILLS KATE MOSS, YEAH.
KILLS KATE MOSS.
Jimmy: IT'S SO FUNNY. YOU'LL LAUGH -- I KNOW, BUT IT'S NOT -- YOU'LL SEE HOW FUNNY IT IS, YEAH. IT'S NOT THAT -- HONESTLY, IT'S GREAT. IT'S WHAT YOU NEED. IT'S SO MUCH FUN. GO HAVE A CHAMPY PARTY AND GO WATCH "AB FAB" THE MOVIE. HERE'S A CLIP OF JOANNA LUMLEY WITH JON HAMM. TAKE A LOOK. ♪♪
