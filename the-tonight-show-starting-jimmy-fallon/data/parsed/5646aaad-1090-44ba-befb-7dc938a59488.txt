Jimmy: WELL SPEAKING OF HASHTAGS, YOU INVENTED THE AIR HASHTAG.
I DID.
Jimmy: I WAS READING "US WEEKLY," AS I ALWAYS DO. RIGHT THERE I INVENTED THE AIR HASHTAG.
MANY YEARS AGO. AT ONE OF THE MANY NERD CONFERENCES I ATTEND. I WAS TALKING AND I WAS -- I LOVED TO SAY HAPPENING LIKE HASHTAG HAPPENING WHEN SOMETHING BIG IS GOING ON. AND I WAS SPEAKING TO THE FOUNDER OF TWITTER. AND I WAS LIKE, IT'S HAPPENING. AND HE WAS LIKE WHAT DID YOU JUST DO? AND I SAID YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE AIR QUOTE LIKE IT WAS AWESOME AND WHEN YOU WANT TO AIR HASHING TO YOU DO DOWN TO THE SIDE. THERE'S YOUR POUND SIGN. SO IT'S LIKE HAPPENING.
Jimmy: REALLY?
FALLON, TONIGHT SHOW.
Jimmy: WE DO A BIT ON THE TONIGHT SHOW.
I KNOW BUT MINE ONLY TAKES ONE HAND. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY HASHTAG. YOU CAN JUST SAY JIMMY OR, SOPHIA BUSH IS HERE, OR WHATEVER, YOU SHOULD TRY IT. IT'S REALLY GOOD. [ CHEERS ] AND LOOK BECAUSE WE IMPRESSED ALL THE PEOPLE AT TWITTER I GOT A TWEET FROM THE CEO OF TWITTER. AND WHEN YOU ARE A NERD THAT'S LIKE YOUR PORN BASICALLY. AND DICK COSTOLO SAID IT WAS A A BIG HIT AT THE OFFICE.
Jimmy: WOW THAT'S PRETTY COOL.
SO --
Jimmy: WELL SEE, I THINK I INVENTED THE AIR HASHTAG.
JUST TRY IT. JUST SAY HAPPENING FOR ME.
Jimmy: HAPPENING. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: NO IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY, OKAY.
Jimmy: THIS IS 2012 RIGHT?

Jimmy: WELL, MY FRIEND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO LOOK AT THIS PUDDING. BECAUSE THERE WILL BE PROOF IN THE PUDDING. WATCH. A LOT OF TIMES ON TWITTER THESE LISTS GET STARTED WHERE TWEET OUT TOPICS WITH A POUND SIGN IN FRONT OF THEM. ON TWITTER THEY CALL IT HASHTAG. FOR INSTANCE SOMEONE WOULD START A HASHTAG CALLED HASHTAG "THINGS THAT BOTHER ME."
Jimmy: YEAH, LOOK FAMILIAR?
OKAY.
Jimmy: HASHTAG. HASHTAG. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS NOTHING.
THIS IS THE AIR HASHTAG.
Jimmy: THIS IS NOT HASHTAG AT ALL.
WHEN YOU DO IT LIKE THIS IT IS A DRUNK HASHTAG. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T HAVE A A CIGARETTE. GET ME A CIGARETTE. IF I DO THIS, SOMEONE'S GONNA HAND ME A CIGARETTE. AND I GO, I DON'T WANT A A CIGARETTE. I WAS HASHTAGING -- HASHTAG DON'T SMOKE.
THIS IS LIKE 6 TEQUILAS.
Jimmy: HASHTAG I DON'T SMOKE.
I DON'T SMOKE EITHER.
Jimmy: I'M FLAMBOYANT. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU DO IT SO WELL.
Jimmy: I KIND OF LIKE DOING IT. YEAH. NOW I'M INTO THE HASHTAG YEAH. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]

Jimmy: HIGH FIVE -- I THINK YOU INVENTED A NEW THING.
NO, I --
Jimmy: CALLING OUT THE HIGH FIVE UNTIL YOU GET YOUR FIVE. HIGH FIVE.
IT'S LIKE A -- IT'S LIKE A A DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING MAN.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING. I'M GOING TO KEEP TALKING UNTIL SOMEONE SMACKS MY HAND. YEAH I LIKE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO STEAL THAT AGAIN.

Jimmy: I THOUGHT I DIED.
YOU KIND OF DID.
Jimmy: I WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN. I THINK I DID DIE. MY HEART STOPPED.
YOU ABSOLUTELY DIED FOR AT LEAST 30 SECONDS.
Jimmy: I GOT OUT OF THE WATER AND I HEARD BAG PIPES. AND I GO, OH NO. BECAUSE I'M A IRISH PERSON AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DIE. YOU HEAR BAG PIPES.
WHEN "AMAZING GRACE" STARTS, IT'S OVER.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE, WE'RE GOING TO HEAVEN. GRANDPA, HERE I COME BUDDY. YOU KNOW? AND THEN I WAS LIKE LOOKING AROUND TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE BAG PIPE PLAYERS. THERE WERE BAGPIPERS THERE AND I WAS LIKE THIS FANTASTIC.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU GET LIKE A RUSH THOUGH. IT'S AN ADRENALINE RUSH AND YOU GET WARM RIGHT AS SOON AS YOU GET OUT. YOU FEEL GREAT.
I THINK YOU'RE LIEING. I THINK YOU BLACKED OUT AND WERE DEAD AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER BEING WARMED IN AN AMBULANCE OR WHEREVER IT WAS BUT YOU CAME BACK TO LIFE.
Jimmy: HIGH FIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP. HERE'S SOPHIA BUSH IN "CHICAGO P.D." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
