Jimmy: WOW, FANTASTIC! HEY! WELCOME! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'VE MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, YOU GUYS, TODAY, IS THE DAY BEFORE THANKSGIVING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO, THAT'S EXCITING. IT'S CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE BUSIEST TRAVEL DAY OF THE YEAR. YEAH. IN FACT, AIRPORTS ARE SO BUSY THE T.S.A. ASKS PASSENGERS TO JUST PAT EACH OTHER DOWN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE LIKE, "WHERE YOU HEADED? YEAH, WHERE YOU GOING? YEAH, ME TOO." "I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING. YOU'RE MY DAD. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, I'M GOING WITH YOU." YEAH, IT'S SO BUSY, SOME AIRPORTS HAD TO OPEN UP A A CHILI'S 3, 4 AND 5. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW BUSY IT IS. I SAW THE CHICAGO O'HARE AIRPORT EVEN HAD THERAPY DOGS ROAMING AROUND THE TERMINALS TODAY TO HELP STRESSED-OUT TRAVELERS. IT MADE EVERYONE RELAX, EXCEPT FOR THE PEOPLE WITH WEED IN THEIR CARRY-ONS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE LIKE, "GET OUT OF HERE! GO! FETCH! GO FETCH!" ACTUALLY, I SAW THAT TODAY WAS DUBBED WEED WEDNESDAY BECAUSE MARIJUANA DISPENSARY SALES GO UP ALMOST 30% THE DAY BEFORE THANKSGIVING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS ] YOU -- YOU KNOW YOU'RE STONED AT THANKSGIVING WHEN YOU HAVE TO ASK, "HOW LONG'S MY HAND BEEN INSIDE THIS TURKEY?" [ LAUGHTER ] "JUST GO. JUST GO. GET OUT OF THE ROOM."
Steve: "WHERE'S THE BASTER?"
Jimmy: SPEAKING OF WEED, I READ THAT A MARIJUANA DISPENSARY IN COLORADO IS OFFERING HOLIDAY GIFT PACKAGES THAT INCLUDE POT BROWNIES AND OTHER EDIBLES. YEAH. IT'S EXPECTED TO BE THE FIRST EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HO! HEY! [ APPLAUSE ] "YOU CARE FOR SOME LUKEWARM CANTALOUPE? [ LAUGHTER ] ONLY ABOUT 30 PEOPLE ATE IT." [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE IS ABLE TO MAKE IT HOME TO EAT THANKSGIVING DINNER WITH THEIR FAMILIES. SO WE PUT TOGETHER THIS TIMELINE OF WHAT THE TYPICAL AMERICAN THANKSGIVING IS LIKE, JUST SO YOU CAN WATCH THIS AND FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT MISSING OUT. FIRST, YOUR AUNT WILL ARRIVE WITH AN APPLE PIE THAT SHE BAKED HERSELF. YOUR MOM ALREADY BOUGHT AN APPLE PIE AT THE STORE, SO THIS WILL BE A THING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: THEN, IN THE KITCHEN, YOUR GRANDFATHER WILL WANDER IN AFTER TWO BOURBONS AND SAY, "TURKEY'S SMALL THIS YEAR." EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE SAME SIZE EVERY YEAR, BUT -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE, IN THE LIVING ROOM, EVERYONE WILL BE WATCHING FOOTBALL, AWKWARDLY SITTING THROUGH A VIAGRA COMMERCIAL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ WHISTLES ] THEN, AT THE DINNER TABLE, BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY BANNED POLITICAL TALK, YOUR GRANDMOTHER WILL SAY, "GREAT, NOW I CAN TALK ABOUT ALL MY AILMENTS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, THE CONVERSATION WILL HAVE THAT MAGICAL BEAT OF SILENCE WHERE SOMEBODY SAYS, "WELL, I THINK IT'S TIME WE GET GOING." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT'S HOW THANKSGIVING USUALLY GOES, SO I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT ONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELL, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY BUSY THIS WEEK PREPARING TO TAKE OFFICE. IN FACT, HE RELEASED A VIDEO WITH AN UPDATE ON HIS WHITE HOUSE TRANSITION AND HIS POLICY PLANS FOR HIS FIRST 100 DAYS AS PRESIDENT. HE SAYS HE'S HARD AT WORK, BUT I NOTICED SOMETHING ODD DURING THE VIDEO. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH AN UPDATE ON THE WHITE HOUSE TRANSITION AND OUR POLICY PLANS FOR THE FIRST 100 DAYS. OUR TRANSITION TEAM IS WORKING VERY EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY -- ♪♪

BUT I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING TO HARVEY BECAUSE HE'D --
Jimmy: YOU BONDED ALREADY.
HE'D JUST BE SO HURT, AND IT WOULD BE WEIRD. SO I JUST KEPT LYING. AND THEN I FELT TERRIBLE BECAUSE OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP WAS JUST BASED ON THIS PILE OF LIES. AND THEN I FINALLY LIKE WORKED UP THE CONFIDENCE TO TELL HIM, LIKE, THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE. AND HE PULLED ME ASIDE THAT DAY AND HE GAVE ME THIS COIN. A SPECIAL MARINE COIN THAT HE'S HAD FOR 50 YEARS. AND HE SAID HE WANTED ME TO HAVE IT.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
AND I TOOK IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I'M A MARINE'S DAUGHTER!
Jimmy: NO YOUR NOT. BUT THEN IT TURNS OUT, THIS WHOLE THING'S A FARCE.
BUT THE WHOLE THING IS A BIG LIE.
Jimmy: THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM.
SO I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE, YOU KNOW, I'M AVOIDING HIM, AND ESPECIALLY I'M AVOIDING HIM AFTER TONIGHT. BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU SEE HIM, YOU CAN GIVE HIM THE COIN BACK.
Jimmy: I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS COIN!
THE COIN.
Jimmy: NO, I DON'T WANT ANYTHING -- HE'S AN ARMY GUY, HE'S GOING TO KILL ME! I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MARINES. MY FATHER-IN-LAW WAS A MARINE. DOES THAT COUNT?
Jimmy: OH MY GOD, I'M SO AFRAID OF IT.
JUST GIVE IT TO HIM NEXT TIME YOU SEE HIM.
