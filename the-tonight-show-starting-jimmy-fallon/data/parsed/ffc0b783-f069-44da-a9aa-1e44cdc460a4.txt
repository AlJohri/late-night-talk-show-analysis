SO, I MARRIED INTO THE TEAM. MY HUSBAND IS A HUGE DALLAS COWBOYS FAN, AS IS HIS FATHER. IT'S A FAMILY AFFAIR. AND EVERY TIME -- WE HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT, MY HUSBAND AND I. EVERY TIME THEY MAKE A A TOUCHDOWN, WE TAKE A SHOT OF WHISKY, WHICH I THINK IS FAIR. I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A GOOD ARRANGEMENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, THAT'S HOW FUN "THE BOS" IS TO HANG OUT WITH. I KNOW. BUT, WAIT A SECOND, THAT MEANS LAST WEEK IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, YOU DID LIKE THREE SHOTS IN TEN MINUTES. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YEAH, IT WAS A GOOD GAME. IT WAS A GOOD GAME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: FROM WHAT I REMEMBER, IT WAS PRETTY FUN.
IT WAS A GOOD GAME, YEAH.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. THAT'S PRETTY COOL. THAT'S GOOD. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I MEAN, THEY'RE GETTING PRETTY FAR.
YES, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: GETTING TO THE END OF THE ROAD HERE.
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD. IT'S FUN. WE HAVE THE JETS HERE AND THE GIANTS, SO WE DRINK WHISKY NO MATTER WHAT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS ]
YOU'RE DRINKING A LOT OF IT.
Jimmy: WE'RE DRINKING A LOT OF IT, YEAH. FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, YEAH. BUT I WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT "STILL ALICE". GOSH, EVERYONE IS PHENOMENAL IN THIS FILM. YOU ARE FANTASTIC. ALEC BALDWIN'S GREAT. JULIENNE MOORE.
OH, SHE'S AMAZING. I MEAN, JUST TO HAVE A FRONT ROW SEAT TO SEE HER PERFORM, HONESTLY, IS JUST INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: YOU'VE NEVER WORKED WITH HER BEFORE?
I'VE NEVER WORKED WITH HER. I'VE KNOWN HER A LITTLE BIT THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, AND SHE'S SO WONDERFUL AND LOVELY. JUST INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: JUST SO HEARTBREAKING.
AMAZING WOMAN TO LOOK UP TO.
Jimmy: AND IT'S BASED ON THE BOOK "STILL ALICE".
IT IS, BY LISA GENOVA. JUST AN AMAZING BOOK. I ACTUALLY HAD READ THE BOOK BEFORE I EVEN KNEW THEY WERE MAKING A FILM.
Jimmy: REALLY? DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY ALZHEIMER'S?
YES, I DO. I HAVE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE. IT AFFECTS SO MANY PEOPLE. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. I THINK IT SHINES A LIGHT ON A A DISEASE THAT AFFECTS SO MANY PEOPLE. JULIE IS INCREDIBLE. IT REALLY IS. SHE'S A TOUR DE FORCE.
Jimmy: EVERYONE'S GREAT IN THIS.
VERY HAPPY TO BE A PART OF IT.
Jimmy: EVERYBODY SHOULD CHECK IT OUT. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S KATE BOSWORTH IN "STILL ALICE". TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
LYDIA, WHAT TIME IS YOUR PLAY?
UM, 8:00.
LYDIA, ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT?
YES, I'LL BE FINE ONCE I'M UP THERE, BUT I'LL DEFINITELY BLOCK ALL OF YOU OUT.
I'M SORRY. WHAT TIME DID YOU SAY IT WAS AGAIN?
8:00.
MOM, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SCHEDULE IT, IT'S OKAY.
NO, NO, I WANT TO PUT IT IN. AND WHERE IS IT?
THE SAUGATUCK THEATER.
CAN YOU SPELL THAT?
YEAH IT'S S-A-U --
MOM, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO FORGET TO BRING YOU.
LET HER DO IT.
S-A-U-G-A-T-U-C-K.
ANNA, YOU'RE NOT HELPING.
NO, YOU'RE NOT HELPING. WHY SHOULD SHE WORRY ABOUT REMEMBERING SOMETHING WHEN SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO REMEMBER IT?
IF YOU JUST LET HER DO IT, SHE WON'T WORRY. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT HER LIKE SHE ISN'T SITTING RIGHT HERE.
I'M NOT. I'M TALKING TO HER. AREN'T I, MOM?
YES. YES, YOU ARE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
