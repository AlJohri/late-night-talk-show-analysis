YOU KNOW, I WALKED TO THE BEAT OF MY OWN DRUM, FOR SURE. I SHAVED MY HEAD WHEN I WAS 12.
Jimmy: DID YOU REALLY?
I DID. I DIDN'T SHAVE IT, ACTUALLY. MY MOM TOOK ME TO, LIKE, A A JAPANESE HAIR ARTIST. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND WHAT IS A HAIR ARTIST? I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THIS.
UM, YOU KNOW, HE JUST TAKES HIS CRAFT VERY SERIOUSLY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO, INSTEAD OF, LIKE, USING A BUZZER TO SHAVE MY HEAD, HE METICULOUSLY USED SCISSORS FOR THE WHOLE THING. IT TOOK, LIKE, 17 HOURS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I ENDED JUST LOOKING LIKE I LOST A DARE. I DIDN'T REALLY LOOK --
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A PHOTO OF YOU AS A KID. [ CHEERS ]
OKAY. YEAH. YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S CUTE.
YEAH. SO, THAT'S HAIR ARTISTRY.
Jimmy: THAT'S HAIR ARTISTRY, YEAH, AT ITS BEST, YEAH.
THAT'S HAIR ARTISTRY AT WORK. AND I WOULD WEAR, I WOULD, LIKE, GO TO THRIFT STORES AND BUY, LIKE, LITTLE POLYESTER SUITS.
Jimmy: THAT'S, THAT'S CUTE. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
MY MOM TOOK ME TO MEXICO, AND EVERYONE WOULD BE LIKE, "OH, NINO." LIKE, "CUTE LITTLE BOY." AND MY MOM WOULD BE LIKE, "NO, NO, NO, NINA." AND THEY'D BE LIKE, "NO, NO, NINO." [ LAUGHTER ] THEY THOUGHT WE DIDN'T SPEAK SPANISH.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPEAK SPANISH.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S GENIUS. THAT'S BRILLIANT. BUT NOW, YOU LIVE IN L.A., THOUGH. THIS IS RIGHT?
I DO.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO FOR THE TV SHOW.
I DO. I HAVE TO LIVE IN L.A. NOW. I LOVE L.A. I'VE BECOME AN L.A.-VANGELIST. BUT, IT IS IRONIC BECAUSE, LIKE, MY MOM USED TO TAKE ME TO THE COUNTRY GROWING UP. TO, LIKE, SHOW ME WHAT GRASS LOOKS LIKE. AND, LIKE, SO I COULD, LIKE, SMELL AIR THAT WASN'T JUST, LIKE, FULL OF GARBAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, BUT, NOW I, LIKE, KIND OF LIVE IN THE SUBURBS, AND GROWING UP, I FOUND THE SUBURBS AND THE COUNTRY VERY SCARY.
Jimmy: HAVE YOU GOTTEN SCARED JUST LIVING IN THE SUBURBS?
OH, I'M TERRIFIED.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT I'M TERRIFIED IN GENERAL JUST BECAUSE I'M A JEWISH NEW YORKER BY BLOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, I'M MORE TERRIFIED NOW THAT I LIVE IN SUBURBS, AND I ALSO LIVE IN MY HOUSES. IT'S SUPER MURDERY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, WAIT. DON'T SAY THAT.
IT IS. WELL, I DON'T MEAN TO, I DON'T MEAN TO INVITE THAT, BUT IT'S ALL GLASS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S ALL GLASS.
Jimmy: I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE, YEAH.
YEAH, I KNOW. WE'VE ALL SEEN THIS MOVIE, YEAH.
Jimmy: ALL GLASS, YEAH.
SO, YEAH, IT'S ALL GLASS, AND SO, OF COURSE, LIKE, THE SECOND WE MOVED IN, I WAS LIKE, "WE NEED AN ALARM SYSTEM."
Jimmy: YES.
AND I MADE MY HUSBAND GET A A BASEBALL BAT TO KEEP NEXT TO THE BED BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE THE GIRL OUT OF BROOKLYN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EVERYONE'S GOT A A BASEBALL BAT.
BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE BROOKLYN OUT OF THE GIRL.
Jimmy: EXACTLY.
SO, HE'S GOT THE BAT, AND, LIKE, ONE OF OUR FIRST NIGHTS IN THE HOUSE, THE ALARM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WAS LIKE, "FRONT DOOR OPEN. FRONT DOOR OPEN." IT SOUNDS SO GENTLE, TOO, WHEN IT'S LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE MURDERED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SPEAKING OF THE ALARMS, THAT'S CRAZY.
THEY SPEAK TO YOU, AND THEY'RE VERY GENTLE, LOVELY WOMEN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, SO SHE TOLD ME THE FRONT DOOR WAS OPEN, AND SO, I, LIKE, OF COURSE, LIKE, FULLY PEED MYSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN --
Jimmy: "GET THE BAT, HONEY!"
I DID. I WAS LIKE, "GET THE BAT AND GO DOWNSTAIRS." WHICH IS SUCH A DOUCHE MOVE IN RETROSPECT AS A WIFE, LIKE, TO BE, LIKE, "JUST RUN ALONG AND GET MURDERED. I'LL BE DOWN IN ONE SECOND." [ LAUGHTER ] SO, HE, LIKE -- HE TAKES THE BAT. HE DOES. HE'S A GOOD HUSBAND. HE TAKES THE BAT, AND HE GOES, HE STARTS, LIKE, CREEPING DOWN THE STAIRS. AND I STOOD AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, AND OF COURSE, LIKE, I SAW OUR LIVES FLASH BEFORE MY EYES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I WAS, LIKE, SO PANICKED, AND THEN SUDDENLY, I FIGURED OUT WHAT I NEEDED TO DO TO SAVE US.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
LIKE, MY BROOKLYN SURVIVAL INSTINCT KICKED IN, AND I SAID OUT LOUD -- HOLD ON, I FEEL LIKE, WILL YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES FOR THIS? I WANT YOU TO, LIKE, BE THERE WITH ME. I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE SHOULD JUST CLOSE THEIR EYES, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY, I --
JUST, LIKE, I WANT TO IMMERSE YOU IN MY EXPERIENCE.
Jimmy: SO, WHAT YOU DID, YOU YELLED AND --
SO, I'M AT THE --
Jimmy: YOU YELL AND JUST MAKE SURE WE HEAR IT, YEAH.
OKAY, OKAY.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND I'LL CLOSE MY EYES.
OKAY, OKAY.
Jimmy: I'M AN INTRUDER.
OKAY, READY? SO, SO, MY HUSBAND'S CREEPING DOWN THE STAIRS, HAS THE BASEBALL BAT. I'M AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS. I FIGURE OUT WHAT I NEED TO SAY TO SAVE OUR LIVES, AND I SAY, "DO YOU WANT TO COME UPSTAIRS AND PLAY WITH ME?" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WHAT? IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OLD CHAIN-SMOKING LADY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME UPSTAIRS AND PLAY WITH ME?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I NEED YOU TO COME BACK UPSTAIRS, AND IT'S TIME TO GO PLAY NOW, HONEY." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M SO HAPPY YOU HAVE AN ALARM SYSTEM. I WANT TO SAY ABOUT YOUR SHOW, CONGRATS, SEASON TWO.
