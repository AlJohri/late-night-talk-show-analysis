I THINK MAYBE HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO SHAKE HANDS. WATCH THIS. WHAT? NO. OH, THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S LIKE MICHELLE OBAMA SAID, "WHEN THEY GO LOW, YOU GO, 'TOO SLOW.'" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE INAUGURATION COMING UP AND ALL THE PROTESTORS. WELL, GET THIS. DONALD TRUMP'S INAUGURAL COMMITTEE IS ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING PROTESTORS TO SHOW UP ON FRIDAY SAYING, QUOTE, "WE'LL GIVE YOU COOKIES AND KOOL-AID."
