THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S VERY NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO I'VE BEEN ENJOYING THE BASKETBALL AND HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIPS. BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ENJOYING THE POSTGAME PRESS CONFERENCES. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR SOME REASON, THEY STILL HAVE NOT LEARNED THAT YOU NEED TO PUT A MICROPHONE ON THE PEOPLE ASKING THE QUESTIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY HAVE A TABLE. THEY GOT THE COACH OR THE ATHLETE SITTING THERE BEHIND A A MICROPHONE. SO THEY KNOW ABOUT MICROPHONES. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE AT HOME WATCHING THIS. [ UNINTELLIGIBLE ] THAT'S AN ADJUSTMENT WE FELT WE NEEDED TO MAKE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] [ UNINTELLIGIBLE ] AH, THREE, MAYBE FOUR. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ UNINTELLIGIBLE ] DEFINITELY.

[ UNINTELLIGIBLE ] PROBABLY PTERODACTYLS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DO THIS AT POLICE PRESS CONFERENCES. WHEN YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. BECAUSE SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY GOT THE POLICE CHIEF. HE'S GOT THE BADGE ON. YOU'RE AT HOME. WHAT'S HAPPENING? AND YOU'RE WATCHING THIS. [ UNINTELLIGIBLE ] AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ESCAPED CONVICTS THERE ARE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ UNINTELLIGIBLE ] NUN CHUCKS AND FLAME THROWERS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ UNINTELLIGIBLE ] YES, THAT'S THE NEIGHBORHOOD WE THINK THEY'RE HIDING IN. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO AS FAR AS SPORTS, MAN, THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT TEAM NICKNAMES AND MASCOTS AND STUFF. I WAS IN ATLANTA. AT AN ATLANTA BRAVES BASEBALL GAME. IT WAS VERY WEIRD. EVERYBODY IN THE STANDS WAS GOING. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] BUNCH OF WHITE PEOPLE EATING COTTON CANDY. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] GIVE ME A LEMONADE! ♪♪ PINK LEMONADE AND SOME MORE CRACKER JACKS -- ♪♪ SHOULD WE BE DOING THIS? FEELS INAPPROPRIATE SOMEHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T THINK THEY MEANT ANYTHING BY IT. BUT SAME THING WHEN I WAS IN ST. LOUIS AT THE CARDINALS GAME, YOU KNOW, THERE FANS ARE GOING. [ WHISTLING ] [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T THINK THEY MEANT ANYTHING BY THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO I KNOW. SO THESE PLAYERS, THEY GOT TO BE GOOD ON THE FIELD AND OFF THE FIELD THESE DAYS RIGHT? I MEAN, THEIR BEHAVIOR IS SCRUTINIZED VERY CLOSELY. AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT WAS UNDERSCORED. A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN MICHAEL VICK GOT CAUGHT DOING STUFF WITH THE DOGS. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY WAS ANGRY. I WAS ANGRY. SO I THOUGHT, WELL WHAT CAN I DO TO SHOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS? SO I HELD IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD A A BE NICE TO ANIMALS PIG ROAST. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PART OF WATCHING THE GAMES?
WELL, YOU KNOW, I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE PRESS CONFERENCES. I HATE WHEN THESE SPORTS REPORTERS FORCE ANSWERS ON PLAYERS, YOU KNOW. IT'S LIKE, "ARE YOU DEDICATING THIS GAME TO YOUR DYING GRANDMOTHER?" [ LAUGHTER ] "I GUESS NOW I AM." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SHE WAS SICK." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING, TOO, THE WINNING TEAM ALWAYS GIVES THE LOSING TEAM A LOT OF CREDIT. "YOU GOT TO GIVE THEM A LOT OF CREDIT." [ LAUGHTER ] THEY CAME TO PLAY." THEY GOT A GOOD TEAM OVER THERE." [ LAUGHTER ] THEY SHOULD HOLD THEIR HEADS UP HIGH. IF WE WENT PERFECT, I DON'T KNOW IF WE WOULD HAVE WON THE GAME. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY GOT A GOOD SQUAD. THEY GOT A GOOD SYSTEM. GOT TO GIVE THEM A LOT OF CREDIT. [ LAUGHTER ] I ALWAYS WONDERED IF THAT NEWS EVER GETS TO THE LOSER'S LOCKER ROOM, YOU KNOW? LIKE, THEY RUN OVER, "GREAT NEWS, FELLAS!" [ LAUGHTER ] "I JUST CAME FROM THE WINNER'S LOCKER ROOM! I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP! THEY ARE GIVING YOU A LOT OF CREDIT!" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "YEAH, I WAS JUST THERE!"
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD.
"I GOT HERE AS QUICKLY AS I COULD!" [ LAUGHTER ] "BUT IT WAS HARD WITH THE BALLOONS AND THE CONFETTI AND ALL THE CHAMPAGNE IN MY EYES. I WAS BOUNCING OFF WALLS. YOU'RE GETTING A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THEIR CHAMPIONSHIP!" [ LAUGHTER ] "AND THEY'RE INVITING ALL OF YOU TO COME OVER AND KISS THEIR RING!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
