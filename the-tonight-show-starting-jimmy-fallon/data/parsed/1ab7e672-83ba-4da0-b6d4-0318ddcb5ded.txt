Jimmy: HI, EVERYBODY! WELCOME! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW"! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELL, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. THE DUST IS STILL SETTLING FROM THE ELECTION. AND I SAW THAT YESTERDAY A A REPORTER ASKED DONALD TRUMP IF HE'S READY TO BE PRESIDENT. AND, HE RESPONDED BY GIVING TWO THUMBS UP. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT'S OFFICIAL. A WHITE GUY IS DEFINITELY BACK IN THE OFFICE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "HEY, GUYS. YEAH. COOL STUFF." [ LAUGHTER ] DID YOU KNOW THIS, TOO? AT AGE 70, DONALD TRUMP IS THE OLDEST PRESIDENT ELECTED IN U.S. HISTORY. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WHICH MEANS HE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IN FOUR YEARS IF AMERICA DUMPS HIM FOR A A YOUNGER, HOTTER PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT HAPPENS. IT SEEMS LIKE TRUMP'S ALREADY GETTING TO WORK. YESTERDAY, HE MET WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND SAID THAT HE HAD GREAT CHEMISTRY WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. WHILE, OBAMA WAS LIKE, "THANK GOD FOR LEGAL WEED." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONE THING A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HAPPY ABOUT THIS AFTER THIS ELECTION IS ALL STATES THAT LEGALIZED. ALL THE STATES THAT LEGALIZED. NOT ALL STATES LEGALIZED MARIJUANA. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, A LOT OF THE STATES LEGALIZED MARIJUANA, INCLUDING MASSACHUSETTS. [ CHEERS ] WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE BOSTON RED SOX JUST BECAME THE BOSTON FLIP-FLOPS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "DUDE, CHECK OUT THE GREEN MONSTER." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT A TRUMP PRESIDENCY MIGHT LOOK LIKE, A A LONG-TIME FRIEND OF TRUMP SAYS THAT TRUMP INTENDS TO BUILD A, QUOTE, "WALL OF UNDERSTANDING." [ LAUGHTER ] HE ALSO SAID TRUMP WOULD PUT UP SOME BARBED WIRE OF COMPASSION AND A ROADBLOCK OF EMPATHY. [ APPLAUSE ] MAYBE JUST TWEAK THE METAPHORS A LITTLE BIT THERE. AND, I READ THAT TRUMP SPOKE WITH PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA YESTERDAY AND PLEDGED TO KEEP AN UNWAVERING ALLIANCE WITH THE COUNTRY. THEN, HE PAUSED AND SAID -- [ AS TRUMP ] "WAIT, YOU'RE THE GOOD KOREA, RIGHT?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "'GANGNAM STYLE'?" [ LAUGHTER ] "OPPA GANGNAM STYLE?" [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DID THAT GO AGAIN? IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS, RIGHT? THIS RIGHT?
Steve: A HORSE RIDING. THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: LIKE THAT?
Steve: YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ SEXY LADY ♪
Jimmy: I'M PRETTY COOL. BUT, TRUMP'S GOT OTHER PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH. FIRST, HE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE TO APPEAR IN COURT BEFORE HE TAKES OFFICE BECAUSE OF A LAWSUIT AGAINST HIM. OF COURSE TO REMAIN IMPARTIAL, THE COURT WANTS A JURY THAT DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THEY'RE GOING TO GO WITH PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR HIM.

[ LAUGHTER ] EVEN SKY MALL WAS LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL? THAT IS SO RANDOM." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, I JUST SAW THAT GEORGE CLOONEY'S TEQUILA COMPANY IS THE FASTEST-GROWING PREMIUM TEQUILA MAKER IN THE COUNTRY. PROBABLY BECAUSE THE MORE YOU DRINK IT, THE MORE WHOEVER IT IS YOU'RE TALKING TO LOOKS LIKE GEORGE CLOONEY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THERE YOU GO! WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT!
