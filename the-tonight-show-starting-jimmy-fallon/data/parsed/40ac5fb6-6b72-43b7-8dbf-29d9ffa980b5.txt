I KNOW. I'M, LIKE, WARMING UP --
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
WITH THE ROOTS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHAT'S UP, FAM? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
HOW ARE YOU GUYS?
Jimmy: HOW'S IT GOING, FAM? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S FUN TO HAVE YOU HERE BECAUSE WHEN I GET INTO THE WHOLE -- THE MOVIES AND ALL THAT STUFF, BUT YOU HAVE A A REALLY FUN STORY ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE SINGING, BASICALLY, KIND OF GOT YOU FIRED FROM THE YOUR JOB.
OH, YES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU WANT TO BRING THAT UP. YES, I WAS WORKING AT OFFICE DEPOT.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, PUSHING INK, AND --
Jimmy: PUSHING INK. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND, YEAH. I WAS LIVING IN A BOARDING HOUSE WITH SIX OTHER GIRLS.
Jimmy: WOW.
I COULDN'T AFFORD MY OWN APARTMENT, SELLING CDs INDEPENDENTLY, AND I DIDN'T HAVE A COMPUTER. I COULDN'T AFFORD IT.
Jimmy: OH, SO YOU GOT TO OFFICE DEPOT.
SO OFFICE DEPOT, YOU GUYS HAVE, LIKE, 200 COMPUTERS ON DISPLAY, AND I USED ONE TO RESPOND BACK TO A FAN WHO HAD SEEN ME PERFORM IN THE LIBRARY STEPS IN THE AUC. SHOUT OUT TO MOREHOUSE FILM IN CLARK IN ATLANTA, AND --
Jimmy: WAIT, SO YOU PERFORMED ON -- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
YES.
Jimmy: THE LIBRARY STEPS?
YES, JIMMY. I USED TO PERFORM ON LIBRARY STAIRS. I JUST LOVE PERFORMING, NOT FOR MONEY.
Jimmy: SO IT'S DURING THE DAY OR NIGHT? WHAT, WHAT DID YOU --
DURING THE DAY, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YES.
FOR ALL THE KIDS, YOU KNOW, GETTING THOSE REFUND CHECKS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEY JUST -- NO, I NEVER DID IT FOR MONEY. I WANTED TO KNOW WAS MY MATERIAL GOOD ENOUGH. AND SO A LONG STORY SHORT, I RESPONDED BACK TO SOMEONE WHO WAS LIKE, "I LOVED YOU. I SAW YOU ON THE LIBRARY STEPS. I WAS ONE OF THREE PEOPLE." [ LAUGHTER ] "AND YOU WERE AMAZING."
Jimmy: YOU WERE LIKE, "I KNOW YOU. YEAH, YOU WALKED BY ME." [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, AND SO THEN --
Jimmy: THEY'RE COOLER THAN OTHER PEOPLE, YEAH.
YEAH, THE VOICE OF GOD JUST CAME, OFFICE DEPOT, "JANELLE ROBINSON TO THE BACK." AND I GO BACK, AND MY BOSS SAID, "LISTEN, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS EASY FOR YOU. YOU'RE FIRED."
Jimmy: YEAH.
"GO DO WHAT YOU LOVE. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HERE."
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO I TOOK MY LITTLE --
Jimmy: "YOU CAN'T USE OFFICE COMPUTERS TO RESPOND TO" --
RIGHT, WHO TOLD YOU?
Jimmy: I SHOULD PROBABLY GET OFF THE MICROPHONE, YEAH.
YEAH, SO --
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T USE OFFICE COMPUTERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT WAS JUST -- IT WAS THE BIG CRIME, I GUESS, I COMMITTED. BUT LUCKILY, IT LED ME TO STAYING FOCUSED.
Jimmy: I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING.
YEAH, STAYING FOCUSED ON WHAT I LOVED.
Jimmy: WHY NOT? YOU GOT ALL THOSE COMPUTERS, YEAH. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE TAKING IT AWAY FROM ANYONE ELSE.
COME ON, MAN.
Jimmy: BUT MAN, OH MAN, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
OKAY.
Jimmy: YOU'RE DOING "HIDDEN FIGURES." YOU DO "MOONLIGHT." YOU'VE GOTTEN -- GOT TO KNOW THE OBAMAS. BUT I SAW YOU AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
NO!
Jimmy: I SEE YOU AT THE WHITE HOUSE MORE THAN I'VE SEEN ANY CELEBRITY AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
AW.
Jimmy: THAT'S GOT TO FEEL AMAZING.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY AN HONOR TO KNOW THE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY. AW, I LOVE THAT PHOTO. THEY ARE THE SWEETEST PEOPLE, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST SO THANKFUL THAT WE HAVE HAD A A LEADER LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA.
Jimmy: YEAH.
HE HAS BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
HE'S A MAN OF THE PEOPLE. HE'S HELPED WOMEN, YOU KNOW, MINORITIES, LGBTQ COMMUNITY. HE'S REALLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE OFTENTIMES MARGINALIZED AND REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A VOICE. AND, I WAS JUST SO HONORED TO BE A PART OF HIS FIRST TERM AND CAMPAIGN AND HELP OUT AND HELP PUSH SOMEONE WHO IS A TRUE VISIONARY AND TRULY DOES CARE ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF THIS COUNTRY.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND YOU GOT TO -- YOU GOT TO SCREEN ONE OF THESE -- OF YOUR FILMS, "HIDDEN FIGURES," WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT FILM.
YES.
Jimmy: FANTASTIC. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE STORY AT ALL.
NOR DID I.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU PLAYED MARY JACKSON. SHE WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN FEMALE ENGINEER AT NASA. YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY, AEROSPACE ENGINEER.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND HELPED GET JOHN GLENN INTO ORBIT.
YES.
Jimmy: AND I DIDN'T KNOW THE STORY AT ALL, AND YOU'RE FANTASTIC IN IT. I WAS LIKE, "JANELLE MONAE!" THIS IS SO GOOD.
YES. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS, BUT I STUDIED ACTING. I WENT TO THE AMERICAN MUSICAL AND DRAMATICS ACADEMY RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK, FRESH FROM KANSAS TO NEW YORK. AND, I'VE ALWAYS HAD AN APPRECIATION FOR JUST STORY TELLING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I NEVER LOOKED AT MYSELF AS JUST A SINGER OR JUST AN ACTOR, BUT SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO TELL THESE UNIVERSAL, UNIQUE, UNTOLD STORIES IN THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE WAYS. SO, WHEN I READ THE SCRIPT, I WAS JUST MOVED, YOU KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THESE WOMEN.
Jimmy: NO.
NOBODY KNEW ABOUT THESE WOMEN. THERE WAS JUST A SHORT WINDOW OF TIME THAT YOU HAD AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN, AND ALSO WHITE WOMEN, THEY WERE CALLED THE HUMAN COMPUTERS. AND, THEY DID ALL THE CALCULATIONS TO HELP OUR FIRST AMERICANS GET INTO SPACE.
Jimmy: GOSH. WELL, THERE'S FRESH FACE TO SEE UP THERE, AND I GO -- I'M JUST SO HAPPY FOR YOU, PAL.
