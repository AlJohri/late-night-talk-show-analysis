THAT POOR KID TALKED.

WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER A A LONG TIME, JIMMY. AND I THINK I'VE PUT MORE INTO OUR RELATIONSHIP THAN YOU HAVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT NICE. DON'T SAY THAT ON THE AIR, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I THINK I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU LOVE ME. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE SOMETIMES.
Jimmy: NO IT DOES NOT. BECAUSE I MEAN, I FOLLOW YOU ON TWITTER. WE TWEET AT EACH OTHER SOMETIMES.
YOU SATIRIZE ME WITH HATE CRIMES ABOUT THE WAY I TALK. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, OH, I'M FROM ENGLAND. OH, COME HERE, LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: CAN I JUST SAY, THAT DOESN'T SOUND MUCH DIFFERENT THAN YOUR FIRST VOICE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S VERY SIMILAR.

Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT BULLYING.
AND YOU JUST DESTROYED ME.
Jimmy: NO, I'M A FAN THOUGH.
I KNOW.

THAT'S A BLOODY GOOD IMPRESSION. IN A WAY, IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HUMILIATED BY YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: REALLY?
I'M ABOUT TO GO MARRY YOU. SO HARD.
Jimmy: I WELL, NO -- IT'S THE VOICE AND THE DELIVERY, IT'S JUST BRILLIANT AND NO ONE ELSE DOES IT. THAT'S WHY I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT YOU'RE DOING STAND-UP AGAIN.
OH YEAH, I AM DOING THAT. THAT'S MY JOB. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH. GOOD FOR YOU. WELL YOU'RE A FANTASTIC -- THAT'S WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU. I WANT TO SAY THAT YOU -- WELL, YOUR ACT, BUT IT WAS WRITTEN, BUT IT LOOKED LIKE YOU JUST PULL OUT A NEWSPAPER AND YOU JUST LOOK THROUGH DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEN YOU MAKE FUN OF THE STORIES. BUT IT LOOK LIKE IT WAS IMPROVISED, BUT CLEARLY IT WAS WRITTEN.
IT WEREN'T. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. I WAS WATCHING "FROZEN." OH [ BLEEP ]. NO, NO.
Jimmy: "MESSIAH COMPLEX" IS THE NAME OF THIS SPECIAL. IT'S ON EPIX.
YEAH, EPIX IS THE TYPE OF TV CHANNEL YOU WON'T HAVE HEARD OF.
Jimmy: YES. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF EPIX YET. BUT IT'S E-P-I-X. WE TUNE IN TO EPIX? WE GO, WOW, FIRST OF ALL, I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS CHANNEL.
NEVER HEARD OF IT.
Jimmy: BUT THIS IS GREAT. WE'RE WATCHING EPIX. HERE'S RUSSELL BRAND. "MESSIAH COMPLEX." DO YOU HAVE A MESSIAH COMPLEX?
OH NO, THAT'S WHERE YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE JESUS. NO, I DON'T HAVE A MESSIAH COMPLEX. IN IT I TALK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE MALCOLM X, CHE GUEVARA, GANDHI AND JESUS AND WHAT MADE THEM SUCH SPLENDID FELLOWS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND ALSO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE FLAWED. NOT JESUS, BECAUSE HE'S A A REALIZATION OF THE PURE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE LORD. BUT THE OTHERS ARE JUST NORMAL FOLK WHO DID GREAT THINGS. [ LAUGHTER ] WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT?
Jimmy: THIS IS WHY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. I LOVE THAT.
GANDHI WAS NICE. MALCOLM X, WHAT A GOOD GUY. CHE GUEVARA, ALL WORKED VERY HARD AND DID SOME GREAT THINGS. FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE, ENCOURAGED ORDINARY PEOPLE TO RISE UP AND FACE CORRUPTION WHEREVER THEY FOUND IT. THAT'S A GOOD THING IN THESE CORRUPT TIMES.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. YOU NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE THESE.
YOU NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE THEM. BUT DON'T HAVE THEM IN A ROOM ALL AT ONCE OR THEY WILL QUARREL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL GOING TO BE RIGHT. YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S TRUE. I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT, YEAH.
MALCOLM, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY BECOME AGITATED BY GANDHI.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T THINK, YEAH, THEY WOULD GET --
OR THEY MIGHT JUST ALL GANDHI. I DON'T KNOW WHAT GANDHI, IS FUSSY ISN'T HE? AND DOESN'T WANT TO EAT ALL THE TIME, AND GOES ON A HUNGER STRIKE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO YOU DON'T SET THE MEETING AT A DINNER SOMEWHERE, OR A RESTAURANT. THAT WOULDN'T BE WHERE --
I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO COME TOGETHER. THAT WOULD BE MY CONCERN. ALL OF THEM IN THEIR OWN WAY ARE GREAT, GREAT MEN.
Jimmy: YEAH. NOW, YOU DO THIS. AND I HEARD THAT HOWARD STERN GOT YOU TO GO BACK TO STAND-UP, IS THAT TRUE?
YEAH, I THINK SO. I THINK HE MIGHT WANT ME TO STOP MAKING FILMS. LIKE, GO AND DO STAND-UP.
Jimmy: NO.
I'M LIKE, WHAT I'M AN ARTIST. HE COMMANDED IT. HE DID.
Jimmy: HE MADE IT HAPPEN.
AND YOU KNOW HOWARD STERN. HE'S SEDUCTIVE, ISN'T HE? YOU GO ON HIS PROGRAMS, AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR PRIVATE LIFE IN AN EXPLICIT WAY.
Jimmy: HE'S FANTASTIC THAT WAY.
HOW DID HE MAKE YOU DO THAT? I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY PERINEUM. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE SPACE BETWEEN YOUR SEXUAL ORGANS AND YOUR ANUS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN'S BOOK.
THAT IS ONE OF YOUR GREAT -- YOU ARE THE KING OF GREAT MINDS. YOU WENT FROM ANUS TO CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. BRILLIANT. HE'S UNSTOPPABLE.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, COME ON.
THAT'S GETTING IN THE SHOW. THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO MAKE IT.
Jimmy: NO, I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS. BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS INTERESTING. BECAUSE SIMON AND SHUSTER ARE HAVING YOU DO THESE BOOKS. "RUSSELL BRAND'S TRICKSTER TALES." AND THESE ARE LIKE, BASED ON, THESE ARE THE ACTUAL STORIES.
OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? FOLK STORIES. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE A KID, YOU HEAR RED RIDING HOOD AND PIED PIPER AND ALL THAT. TURNS OUT THAT DEEP WITHIN THAT IS A CODE TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE THINK. WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THESE KIND OF STORIES THESE DAYS. WE DON'T HAVE STORIES THAT ENCOURAGE US TO THINK INDIVIDUALISTICALLY AND MATERIALISTICALLY. IF WE READ THOSE KIND OF FOLK STORIES, IT CONNECTS TO ONE ANOTHER AND COMBINE FORCES IN A A BOOK FOR CHILDREN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: BUT THIS GUY, AND IT'S WELL -- THE DRAWINGS ARE AMAZING AS WELL IN THIS BOOK, I SHOULD SAY. WHO DREW THIS? CHRIS?
DO YOU GET NERVOUS WHEN PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHY, JIM? [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN, IT'S A A GREAT FEAR OF MINE. AS A COMEDIAN, I WOULD LIKE TO THINK I'M IN CHARGE OF THE LAUGHING.
Jimmy: YOU'RE THE REASON WHY THEY'RE LAUGHING. YOU'RE A FUNNY HUMAN BEING, THAT'S WHY. THAT'S WHY, RIGHT? YOU'RE LAUGHING BECAUSE HE'S FUNNY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHY THEY'RE LAUGHING. YOU'RE VERY FUNNY. YOU HAVE A SKILL. BUT THE PIED PIPER, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TWISTED AND WEIRD THIS STORY WAS. I FORGOT WHAT IT WAS. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE MAN WHO HAS A FLUTE OR SOMETHING?
THE PIED PIPER, THEY GOT A A RAT PROBLEM, LIKE HERE IN NEW YORK AS A MATTER OF FACT. THEY'VE GOT A RAT PROBLEM.
Jimmy: NO WE DON'T HAVE A A RAT PROBLEM ANYMORE, REALLY?
DON'T TRY TO DENY YOUR RAT PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S BAD.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
I SEEN ONE LIKE A PERSON ARGUING WITH ME.
Jimmy: YOU GOT IN AN ARGUMENT WITH A RAT?
I GOT THE IDEA FOR THE BOOK FROM THE RATS. WRITE ABOUT RATS. FROM A NEW YORK RAT.
Jimmy: HE YELLED THAT TO YOU, YEAH.
THEY DEVELOPED A LANGUAGE. THEY'RE SO EVOLVED. THEY'RE SO PROTECTED HERE. WHAT HAPPENED IS, OH YEAH, THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN. THEY'VE GOT A TOWN, THEY GOT A A RAT PROBLEM. THE BLOKE SHOWS UP AND GOES I CAN SOLVE YOUR RAT PROBLEM. LIKE THAT BLOKE IN "JAWS", LIKE HIM.
Jimmy: YES.
THEN HE TAKES THE RATS AWAY. THEY KNOCK HIM FOR THE MONEY. THAT'S AN ENGLISH WORD MEANING THEY DIDN'T PAY HIM FOR THE MONEY. THEY DON'T GIVE HIM THE MONEY. SO HE GOES, WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY ME, WE'LL TAKE ALL OF THE CHILDREN. AND THEN HE DOES DO THAT. NOW THAT'S AN OVERREACTION. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WOULD AGREE, IT'S A A BIT OF AN OVERREACTION. MAYBE JUST GET A LAWYER AND SAY, HEY, YOU OWE ME THE MONEY.
SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
Jimmy: JUDGE JUDY PERHAPS. YEAH.
JUDGE JUDY, PLEASE. THEY'VE NOT PAID FOR THIS. FOR THE RATS.
Jimmy: HE'S NOT PAID FOR THIS. HE GOT RID OF THE RATS. THEY DIDN'T PAY HIM.
OH, HE'LL TAKE THE CHILDREN THEN. SO THAT'S AN OVERREACTION.
Jimmy: SO HE TAKES THE CHILDREN. THEN I FORGET THE ENDING.
THAT IS IT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE ENDING IS ALL THE CHILDREN GET TAKEN. SO WHAT IS THAT TELLING YOU? IF YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED TO A A DIVINE FORCE, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE PIPE. THE PIED PIPER IS CONNECTED TO A MAGICAL WORLD. IF YOU FORGET THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU'LL LOSE WHAT YOU VALUE THE MOST. BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S A STORY ABOUT A WEIRD GUY WHO STEALS A A LOT OF CHILDREN. AND I DON'T WANT TO TRY TO PROMOTE THAT ON YOUR SHOW.
Jimmy: NO, NO. YOU'VE ALREADY DONE ENOUGH OF THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. "RUSSELL BRAND'S TRICKSTER TALES", YOU GUYS. IF YOU WANT TO PICK UP THIS BOOK HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HAVE A TRICKSTER GAME I'D LIKE TO PLAY WITH YOU.

IN THE GLORIOUS CORNUCOPIA OF WORLD OF ENTERTAINMENT, YOU NEED MEN LIKE THEM TO SUPPORT YOU, I SUPPOSE. DON'T YOU?
Jimmy: I DO. WE NEED GREAT MEN.
GREAT NOBLE MEN. MEN LIKE, I DON'T KNOW -- THIS GAME'S MAKING ME FEEL LIKE I'M TRAPPED IN A PRISON OF LANGUAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M IN A VORTEX OF WORDS.
Jimmy: I KNOW. IT'S KIND OF FUN TO SEE YOU TRY TO GET OUT.
YOU TRAPPED ME. YOU'VE TRICKED ME, YOU'VE PLAYED GAMES WITH ME. I FEEL LIKE I'M AN INSTRUMENT THAT YOU'RE PLAYING. LIKE YOU'RE ORCHESTRATING MY EMOTIONS BUT WITH A VARIETY OF TUNES. WHETHER IT'S TANGO, MAMBO, OR LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, SOME INTERNATIONAL DANCE FESTIVAL THAT YOU'RE PLAYING WITH MY CONSCIOUSNESS. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, AS LONG AS I'VE SAID THE WORD, MY WORK IS DONE, RIGHT?
Jimmy: I GUESS SO, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
A LOT OF THESE WORDS ARE OUTRAGEOUS.
Jimmy: WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF TROUBLE WHEN JOHN GOODMAN WAS HERE LAST WEEK, I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.
I THINK A LOT ABOUT THESE WORDS, JIM. AND THE TAPES WILL SHOW I'VE BEEN A BLOODY GOOD SPORT.
Jimmy: WAIT SO ALL OF THE WORDS. YOU DIDN'T GO IN ORDER. YOU JUST RANDOMLY GOT ALL THE WORDS IN?
YOU DIDN'T EXPLAIN TO ME THAT THIS WAS LIKE THE DICTATORSHIP OF LANGUAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT I WAS LIVING IN SOME SORT OF SING-SING OF LINGO, SOME PRISON. YEAH?
Jimmy: YEAH. WELL I THINK, I THINK -- I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE NUTS.
WHAT I THINK YOU'VE DONE IS YOU'VE TYRANNIZED ME WITH YOUR MASCULINITY. BUT THERE IS AN AIR OF FEMININITY TO YOU. YOU'RE LIKE A PERVERSE HYBRID. LIKE A FEMALE BODY BUILDER. LIKE A PERSON WHO'S NEITHER ONE THING OR ANOTHER. LIKE A HERMAPHRODITE WITH A NEW GENITAL IN YOUR ARMPIT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, I'M JUST --
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT --
Jimmy: I'M JUST HARD TO DESCRIBE. I'M LIKE, I'M LIKE GRAPE NUTS. IT'S A CEREAL. IT'S WHEAT. IT'S NOT GRAPES. IT'S NOT NUTS. IT'S A BREAKFAST CEREAL, AND IT'S GOOD FOR YOU. AND THE MORE YOU EAT ME, THE BETTER YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL, MAN.
JIMMY, WHEN YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, IT MAKES ME WANT TO KISS YOUR BUNG HOLE. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: IT'S FASCINATING. HERE YOU ARE, WRITING ABOUT YOUR MOM. IT'S INTERESTING TO FIND OUT THESE STORIES. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT YOUR MOM. I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR MOM.
WELL, I MEAN, LIKE MOST PEOPLE, THEY KNOW WHAT'S BEEN SORT OF MORE CONTINUOUSLY WRITTEN ABOUT HER AND --.
Jimmy: YEAH, SHE WAS YOUR MANAGER.
SHE WAS MY MANAGER, SHE WAS MY MOM, SHE WAS MY EVERYTHING. I MEAN, IT THE TWO OF WAS US AGAINST THE WORLD, DURING A A TIME WHEN THERE WEREN'T MANY YOUNG ACTORS, THERE WEREN'T MANY YOUNG MODELS. THERE WEREN'T.
Jimmy: YEAH.

Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH THANK YOU.
I DON'T KNOW NOW, AFTER WHAT YOU JUST EXPERIENCED.

Jimmy: SHE'S ALSO GORGEOUS. I MEAN COME ON LOOK HOW.
LOOK HOW SEX -- SHE WAS LIKE THIS BABE. SHE WAS THIS SORT OF.
Jimmy: BEAUTIFUL, YOUR MOM.
SHE WAS JUST SORT OF AND THAT'S WHO SHE KIND OF CREATED, SHE WAS SORT OF LARGER THAN LIFE. SHE WAS FROM NEWARK. SHE WAS, YOU KNOW, THIS UNBELIEVABLE -- I MEAN, SHE GOT OUT OF NEWARK AND SHE WAS GOING TO MAKE A NAME FOR HERSELF.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SHE WAS NOT WEALTHY. BUT SHE WANTED TO BE ACCEPTED BY SOCIETY. AND SO, I MEAN, SHE'S THE KIND OF WOMAN THAT COULDN'T AFFORD THE DRESSES -- THE PUCCI DRESSES, THAT SORT OF LIKE THE RICH UPPER EAST SIDE WOMEN WORE. AND SO SHE -- AND HE -- EMILIO WOULD WRITE HIS NAME IN ALL THE DRESSES.
Jimmy: EMILIO PUCCI.
EMILIO PUCCI. SHE WOULD MAKE HER OWN DRESSES. AND PUT TERRI. AND PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE --
Jimmy: YOU DON'T HAVE A A TERRI, OH. GOOD FOR HER.
SHE WAS LIKE IT WAS GREAT UNTIL IT RAINED. IT WOULD BE LIKE --.
Jimmy: THE INK WOULD RUN, YEAH ABSOLUTELY. ANOTHER STORY THAT I WAS LOOKING, LOOKING THROUGH. I SAW THERE WAS ONE WHERE SHE WORKED AT A MAKE UP COUNTER.
YES.
Jimmy: AND SO, SHE WOULD APPLY MAKEUP TO WOMEN.
RIGHT. WELL, SHE GOT THIS JOB UN-SCHOOLED. AND SEE, SHE BASICALLY SAID -- THERE WAS A MAKEUP ARTIST POSITION OPENING, AND SHE SAID, I'LL DO THAT. AND SHE ACTED AS IF SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
Jimmy: BUT SHE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT?
NO, AND SHE'S RIGHT-HANDED. SO SHE'S ONLY CAPABLE OF DOING THE LEFT SIDE OF SOMEONE'S FACE.
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
SO AFTER --
Jimmy: THAT'S HALF THE BATTLE.
AFTER CREATING A PICASSO, A A COUPLE OF FACES SHE WAS LIKE, OH, I BETTER FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. SHE WOULD DO THE LEFT SIDE, STOP, TURN THEM IN THE MIRROR AND SAY, "NOW, LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT I DID AND REPEAT IT."
Jimmy: NOW LET'S SEE YOU DO IT. LET'S SEE YOU FINISH THE PROJECT.
YEAH, SO THEY WERE LIKE, OH MY GOD, WE JUST GOT A LESSON FROM THE EXPERT.
Jimmy: THAT'S A BRILLIANT WAY OF DOING IT. AND THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS A GENIUS. I MEAN, THAT'S THE WAY SHE LIVED HER LIFE. SHE DIDN'T KNOW SHE CREATED.
Jimmy: AND THEN SHE ALSO VERY -- ONE OF THE THINGS I THOUGHT WAS COOL, YOU WANTED TO EAT DESSERT ALL THE TIME. YOU WANTED YOU EAT --
I WANTED TO EAT DEVIL DOGS FOR DINNER.
Jimmy: DEVIL DOGS ARE THE MOST DELICIOUS THINGS IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.
YEAH, WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT THAT?
Jimmy: YOU JUST WANTED TO EAT THEM FOR DINNER.
I JUST WANTED TO EAT THEM FOR DINNER. SHE SAID, YOU WANT THEM FOR DINNER? SHE BOUGHT ME 12 OF THEM AND SAID EAT THEM ALL. AND I WAS LIKE NIRVANA. I WAS LIKE, I HAVE THE BEST MOM IN THE WORLD.
Jimmy: YOU ARE THE BEST MOM IN THE WORLD! AND BY THREE, I WAS LIKE --
Jimmy: EXACTLY.
SHE'S LIKE, NO, CONTINUE. AND HONESTLY, IT WAS THE LAST DAY OF MY LIFE I'VE EVER EATEN A DEVIL DOG.
Jimmy: REALLY? OH, THEY'RE DELICIOUS.
I KNOW. BUT SERIOUSLY, IT WAS LIKE -- SHE HAD THIS WEIRD REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY.
Jimmy: IS THIS HOW YOU'RE RAISING YOUR KIDS? BECAUSE, I'VE MET YOUR KIDS AND THEY'RE GREAT.
YEAH, YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T WORK ON THEM. THEY'RE SORT OF NO.
Jimmy: IT DOESN'T WORK, NO.
THEY'RE LIKE, ARE YOU AN IDIOT? I'M GOING TO EAT 12? LIKE THEY'RE JUST --
Jimmy: THEY'RE JUST SMART, THEY'RE LIKE NO, I'M NOT GOING TO EAT 12, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO MOM?
YEAH, I MEAN, I'M SO MUCH MORE NAIVE THAN MY KIDS ARE. IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH SAVVIER THEY ARE AND HOW MUCH MORE MANIPULATIVE THEY ARE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, REALLY THEY ARE, YEAH.
FOR REAL. LIKE I, IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME TO QUESTION MY MOTHER, TO MANIPULATE. SHE WAS LARGER THAN LIFE. SHE WAS GOD TO ME.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SHE -- I WASN'T GOING TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT MY MOTHER. I REALLY WASN'T, IT WASN'T ABOUT ME PER SE. I WAS SORT OF THE TEMPLATE TO TELL THE STORY ABOUT HOW AMAZINGLY COMPLEX MOTHERS ARE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND WE ALL HAVE THEM. AND WE EITHER WANT TO BE LIKE THEM, OR WANT TO NOT BE LIKE THEM. BUT WE WANT ENOUGH OF THEM OR WE DON'T, OR WE MISS THEM OR WE WANT MORE FOR THEM. AND IT'S AMAZING, YOU COME FROM THESE PEOPLE.
