Questlove: 270!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT BACK AT YOU. I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." YOU'RE HERE. THIS IS IT. WELCOME. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. BIG NEWS FOR KIM KARDASHIAN. SHE JUST REVEALED THAT SHE AND KANYE WEST ARE EXPECTING THEIR SECOND CHILD. YOU CAN TELL IT'S KIM'S BABY, BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY TOOK ITS OWN SONOGRAM PICTURE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, KIM KARDASHIAN ANNOUNCED THAT SHE AND KANYE ARE EXPECTING THEIR SECOND CHILD. THEY SAY THEY DON'T CARE WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR GIRL, JUST AS LONG AS IT'S FAMOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] BIGGER NEWS OUT OF THE KARDASHIAN CAMP IS THE NEW "VANITY FAIR" COVER WHICH FEATURES THE FIRST PHOTO OF CAITLYN JENNER, FORMERLY KNOWN AS BRUCE JENNER. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, THIS IS THE ACTUAL JULY COVER OF "VANITY FAIR." YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ] I THINK THE MOST SHOCKING THING IS IT'S ONLY JUNE, AND SHE'S ALREADY IN BATHING SUIT SHAPE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S YOUR SECRET? AND I SAW THAT KANYE WEST ACTUALLY SPOKE TO GRADUATES OF THE LOS ANGELES TRADE TECHNICAL COLLEGE LAST WEEK AND SAID QUOTE, "WHEN YOU'RE THE ABSOLUTE BEST, YOU GET HATED ON THE MOST." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HE ADDED, "SO, Y'ALL WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING HATED ON." THAT WAS MEAN. THAT WAS MEAN. HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT. LOS ANGELES TRADE TECHNICAL COLLEGE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HE DIDN'T NEED TO DO THAT.
Jimmy: THEY HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. A BIG STORY OUT OF WASHINGTON. AFTER THE SENATE FAILED TO PASS A BILL ON THE PATRIOT ACT LAST NIGHT, THE NSA CAN NO LONGER COLLECT AMERICANS' PHONE RECORDS IN BULK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, THEY DECIDED TO NOT MONITOR OUR PHONE CALLS WHEN THEY REALIZED THAT NO ONE HAS MADE A PHONE CALL IN SEVEN YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S THIS? PHONE? WHEN ASKED HOW THEY FELT ABOUT NO LONGER BEING ABLE TO SPY ON AMERICANS, THE NSA WAS LIKE, "GOOD. YOU PEOPLE ARE GROSS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I WISH I COULD UNSEE SOME STUFF." HERE'S SOME CAMPAIGN NEWS. THIS WEEKEND, FORMER MARYLAND GOVERNOR MARTIN O'MALLEY OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WITH THE SLOGAN, "NEW LEADERSHIP." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE IF ANYTHING MAKES AMERICANS FEEL GOOD, IT'S SEEING THE SAME SIGN YOU SEE OVER A LAUNDROMAT THAT'S GONE OUT OF BUSINESS 10 TIMES. NEW LEADERSHIP. THIS WILL BE MUCH BETTER. [ APPLAUSE ] THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT. DID YOU HEAR THIS? IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY, JEB BUSH SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, BUT HE STILL HAS NOT MADE A FINAL DECISION YET. EVEN HILLARY WAS LIKE, "BUSH, PLEASE." [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS ] AND DURING A SPEECH IN IOWA THIS WEEKEND, BERNIE SANDERS CRITICIZED THE "BILLIONAIRE CLASS" AND SAID THAT THEY CAN'T HAVE IT ALL. BILLIONAIRES WOULD'VE RESPONDED, BUT THEY WERE BUSY THIS WEEKEND LITERALLY HAVING IT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE SOCCER ORGANIZATION FIFA, WHICH DECIDES WHICH CITIES GET TO HOST THE WORLD CUP. AND I GUESS THEY'RE SAYING THAT FIFA OFFICIALS ACCEPTED BRIBES WHEN MAKING THEIR DECISIONS. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] OF COURSE, THE TOUGHEST PART FOR THE SOCCER OFFICIALS WAS TAKING BRIBES WITHOUT USING THEIR HANDS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST PUT IT IN MY POCKET. JUST PUT IT IN MY POCKET. YEAH, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ACTUALLY CHARGED NINE FIFA OFFICIALS WITH RACKETEERING, WIRE FRAUD, AND MONEY LAUNDERING. IT'S NOT GOOD. EXPERTS SAY IF CONVICTED, THE OFFICIALS COULD BE SENT TO PRISON WITHOUT PAR-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A A ROW, THE SCRIPPS NATIONAL SPELLING BEE ENDED IN A TIE, WITH TWO WINNERS. OR AS EACH OF THEIR PARENTS PUT IT, "I TOLD YOU YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE OUTSIDE TO PLAY THAT ONE TIME." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS WAS PRETTY CRAZY. I SAW THAT ENRIQUE IGLESIAS CUT HIS FINGER AFTER HE GRABBED A A DRONE FROM THE AIR DURING A A CONCERT SATURDAY NIGHT IN TIJUANA. OR AS THAT'S ALSO KNOWN, THE LEAST WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU ON A SATURDAY NIGHT IN TIJUANA. [ APPLAUSE ] I MARRIED A DONKEY. THIS MADE ME LAUGH. LAST WEEK -- THIS IS FUNNY. A POLICE OFFICER IN TEXAS WAS RESCUED FROM A FLOOD BY A A HELICOPTER, BUT ONCE THE HELICOPTER PICKED HIM UP, IT DIDN'T WANT TO PUT HIM BACK DOWN. FOR SOME REASON. TAKE A LOOK AT HOW LONG THIS GUY WAS DANGLING.
THERE IS ACTUALLY HELICOPTER OVERHEAD AND THAT OFFICER HAD TO BE LIFTED OUT OF DANGER.
LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO GENTLY PUT HIM DOWN.
THAT RIDE PROBABLY WENT ON A A LOT LONGER THAN THAT OFFICER WAS -- LOOK AT THIS.
PUT HIM DOWN. I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE DRIVING AROUND WITH THE GUY. THERE YOU GO. [ DING ]
Jimmy: FOUR MINUTES! FOUR MINUTES HIM DANGLING. [ APPLAUSE ] ANYONE ELSE FEEL LIKE THE HELICOPTER PILOT JUST FORGOT ABOUT HIM? WHAT'S THAT BUMPING NOISE?
