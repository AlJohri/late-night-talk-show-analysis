Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] APPRECIATE THAT. MAKES ME FEEL SO GOOD. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME. [ CHEERS ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. YOU ARE "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE ARE "THE TONIGHT SHOW." WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FUN SHOW TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. I WANT TO SAY CONGRATS TO THE NEW YORK METS WHO BEAT THE DODGERS TO ADVANCE TO THE NATIONAL LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES. MAN, YOU CAN TELL NEW YORK'S GOT BASEBALL FEVER. BECAUSE TODAY IN THE SUBWAY, I SAW A RAT DRAGGING SOME PEANUTS AND CRACKER JACKS. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS GOING TO GET MY PHONE OUT AND YOUTUBE IT. MEANWHILE, THE CUBS HAVE A A CHANCE AT WINNING THEIR FIRST WORLD SERIES -- [ CHEERS ] -- IN 107 YEARS, WHICH THE MOVIE "BACK TO THE FUTURE II" ACTUALLY PREDICTED WOULD HAPPEN IN 2015. [ APPLAUSE ] ISN'T THAT WEIRD? I MEAN, IT ISN'T ALL THAT SURPRISING SINCE WE ALSO HAVE HOVERBOARDS, AND DOC BROWN IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, APPARENTLY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MARTY! LET'S GET TO SOME POLITICAL NEWS HERE. JEB BUSH'S CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT IT RAISED OVER $13 MILLION LAST QUARTER, WHICH MEANS HE'S DOING BETTER THAN MOST OF THE OTHER MAJOR CAMPAIGNS. YEAH. OR AS JEB PUT IT, "CRAP." [ LAUGHTER ] "HOW DO I LOSE THIS THING?" ACTUALLY, I SAW THAT JEB BUSH'S CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN STAYING AT CHEAPER HOTELS TO SAVE MONEY. WHICH WOULD MAKE JEB THE FIRST POLITICIAN EVER TO BOOK A ROOM AT A CHEAP HOTEL JUST TO SLEEP. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT? FANTASTIC. TIMES ARE CHANGING. AND A LITTLE TROUBLE FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE LINCOLN CHAFEE. AT THE DEBATE ON TUESDAY, HE BRAGGED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN 30 YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, HE'S NEVER HAD ONE SCANDAL. WELL, THIS JUST CAME OUT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THIS IS REAL. CHAFEE ONCE USED TAXPAYER MONEY TO BUY FROGS FOR HIS OFFICE AQUARIUM. [ LAUGHTER ] HE BOUGHT FROGS. THAT'S THE SCANDAL.
Steve: THAT'S THE SCANDAL.
Jimmy: YES, PEOPLE SAID AT LEAST IT WASN'T A SEX SCANDAL. AND CHAFEE WAS LIKE, "RIIIGHT." [ LAUGHTER ] "RIGHT, NO, NEVER, NEVER."
Steve: RIBBIT.
Jimmy: RIBBIT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LISTEN TO THIS, GUYS. I SAW THAT TOM BRADY JUST DID AN INTERVIEW WHERE HE CALLED COCA-COLA POISON FOR KIDS AND SAID HE DIDN'T THINK FROSTED FLAKES WAS ACTUALLY FOOD. THAT STORY, AGAIN, DO NOT GO TRICK-OR-TREATING AT TOM BRADY'S HOUSE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "YOU GUYS WANT SOME RAISINS AND A TOOTH BRUSH?" [ APPLAUSE ] "NO." "WHY DON'T YOU GUYS DO SOME CRUNCHES?"

GOOD FOR HER. OF COURSE, AS A "GAME OF THRONES" ACTRESS, SHE'S JUST THRILLED TO BE NAMED "ALIVE." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW "GAME OF THRONES" WORKS. SPEAKING OF "GAME OF THRONES," A BRITISH AUTHOR WHO WROTE THE NEW BBC SHOW CALLED "THE LAST KINGDOM" ACTUALLY CRITICIZED "GAME OF THRONES" AND SAID THE SHOW IS NOTHING BUT DRAGONS AND BOOBS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN FANS OF THE SHOW WERE LIKE, "YEAH. EXACTLY." [ LAUGHTER ] THE ONLY THING BETTER WOULD BE A DRAGON WITH BOOBS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT STAY TUNED FOR THE SEASON. NO SPOILERS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS SEASON OF "HOMELAND." IT'S A GOOD SHOW. BUT APPARENTLY SOME EGYPTIAN GRAFFITI ARTISTS -- THEY WERE HIRED TO PAINT GRAFFITI IN THE BACKGROUND OF A SCENE. MAYBE THEY WERE JUST ARTISTS THAT WERE JUST HIRED TO PAINT GRAFFITI IN THE BACK. THEY ACTUALLY WROTE SOME ARABIC PHRASES CRITICIZING THE SHOW, BUT NO ONE NOTICED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT WAS IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE SHOW. IT'S MAKING FUN OF "HOMELAND." YEAH. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENED. DO YOU REMEMBER THIS? IT HAPPENED HERE ON THIS NETWORK. CHECK OUT THIS CLIP FROM "LAW AND ORDER." WATCH THIS.

Steve: THEY DIDN'T CATCH THAT?
Jimmy: IT WAS WRITTEN IN ENGLISH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS A PRETTY CRAZY STORY. I SAW THAT A BEAR WAS RECENTLY SPOTTED ROAMING THE HALLS AT A A HIGH SCHOOL IN MONTANA. EITHER THAT, OR PUBERTY HIT REAL HARD FOR ONE STUDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] "I GOT HAIR, COACH! COACH, I GOT HAIR! I GOT TO TALK TO YOU, COACH." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK SET A RECORD FOR THEIR MOST VISITORS EVER THIS YEAR, WHICH THEY'RE ATTRIBUTING TO LOW GAS PRICES AND GOOD MARKETING, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT KIDS ARE SO DISTRACTED BY THEIR PHONES, YOU CAN DRIVE THEM ANYWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, "WAIT, THIS ISN'T THE MALL. I HATE YOU." " [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, HYATT HOTELS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL NO LONGER OFFER ON DEMAND ADULT MOVIES IN ITS ROOMS. WHILE MOTEL 6 SAID IT'LL ONLY OFFER A TAPE OF THE COUPLE THAT STAYED IN THE ROOM BEFORE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, YOU GUYS. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS. ♪♪
