YOU ALWAYS DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. IS THIS -- I DON'T WANT TO KEEP -- IT'S HARD TO INTERVIEW A WHOLE BAND. BUT, WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO ANSWER? WHEN YOU GO ON TOUR, IS IT A A WHOLE NEW EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU PLAY LIKE THE NEW SONGS? DO THEY HAVE A NEW MEANING? DO THEY FEEL DIFFERENT?
FIVE YEARS WRITING AND RECORDING, IT'S A LONG TIME, A A LOT OF ENERGY. AND YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THOSE SONGS, HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT.

WELL, I MEAN, IT ALL COMES FROM US ULTIMATELY. BUT THE IDEA IS THAT THERE'S TWO ALBUMS IN PROCESS. AND THIS IS THE FIRST ALBUM. THE ALBUM OF INNOCENCE. BUT, OUR STAGE DESIGN ALSO TAKES US INTO EXPERIENCE.
Jimmy: THE SOUND ON THIS TOUR IS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER TOURS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN OUT THERE AVAILABLE.
YEAH. OUR THING AS A BAND ALWAYS WAS TO TRY TO GET AS CLOSE TO THE AUDIENCE AS WE POSSIBLY COULD IN EVERY SENSE. SO, EVERY U2 SHOW THERE'S EVER BEEN THERE'S KIND OF AN EFFORT TO BRIDGE THAT GAP. AND WE'VE DONE IT IN THIS TOUR WITH THE SET DESIGN. SO, WE'VE GOT THIS INCREDIBLE STAGE THAT IS A CONVENTIONAL STAGE AT ONE END. BUT, WE'VE GOT THIS CONNECTED RAMP THAT GOES THE FULL LENGTH OF THE VENUE TO ANOTHER AREA AT THE OTHER END OF THE FLOOR. SO WE BASICALLY CAN BE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD. AND AS WELL AS HAVING THAT SORT OF CONNECTION AND INTIMACY, THE SOUND THAT WE'VE PRODUCED, THE SOUND SYSTEM, GIVES EVERYBODY THE SAME QUALITY OF SOUND THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BUILDING. SO, EVERYBODY WILL GET THE BEST POSSIBLE SOUND.
NEW CLEAR BROTHER SYSTEM.
IT'S KIND OF SURROUND SOUND. IT'S LIKE 10% OR 20% BETTER THAN SOUND YOU'VE EVER HEARD HERE AT THE GARDEN.
