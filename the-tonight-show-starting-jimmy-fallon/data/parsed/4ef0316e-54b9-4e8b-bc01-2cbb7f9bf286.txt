I DID GET TO MEET HIM.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
IT WAS A MIXTURE OF THE MOST AMAZING MOMENT OF MY LIFE AND THE MOST EXCRUCIATING. I BASICALLY SPENT FOUR MONTHS RESEARCHING EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MAN TRYING DESPERATLY TO UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE. LIKE, LEARNING ALL ABOUT ALS. AND THEN, I FINALLY MET HIM. AND WHEN YOU MEET STEPHEN, BECAUSE IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR HIM TO SPEAK NOW. THERE'S A KIND OF, VERY UNIQUE RHYTHM AND SO THERE ARE LONG PAUSES. AND I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAS LIKE A SEVERE HATRED OF SILENCE. AND SO I BASICALLY WAS SO NERVOUS THAT I PROCEEDED TO SPEW FORTH INFORMATION ABOUT STEPHEN HAWKING TO STEPHEN HAWKING. [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT TO THIS UTTERLY HORRIFIC MOMENT WHERE THERE WAS SORT OF BIG LULL. AND STEPHEN MAKES A POINT OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS BORN ON THE 8th OF JANUARY, 300 DAYS -- 300 YEARS AFTER GALILEO. AND I WAS CHOOSING TO TELL HIM THIS PIECE OF INFORMATION ABOUT HIMSELF THAT HE HAD TOLD ME IN A BOOK. AND OF COURSE, STEPHEN, YOU WERE BORN ON THE 8th OF JANUARY. AND I WAS ACTUALLY BORN ON THE 6th OF JANUARY SO WE'RE BOTH CAPRICORNS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE --. HE LOOKED AT ME, AND THERE WAS THIS SORT OF HORRIFIC SORT OF FEW MINUTES AS HE TYPED SOMETHING OUT AND THEN, IN HIS ICONIC VOICE HE SAID -- I'M AN ASTRONOMER, NOT AN ASTROLOGER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC. WELL, I LIKE TO SHOW EVERYONE A A CLIP. THIS IS -- YOU'RE NOT TOO FAR ALONG WITH THE DISEASE IN THIS CLIP. BUT YOU'RE -- IT'S -- YOU GOT TO SEE IT. SO IT'S YOU, AND YOU JUST GOT TOLD THAT YOU GOT YOUR DOCTORATE.
ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: SO THIS ONE HERE IS EDDIE REDMAYNE IN "THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING."
YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH OF THAT, OLD MAN. COME ON, GOT TO -- ONE, TWO -- THREE. [ GROANS ]
MY GOD, HOW DOES JANE MANAGE?
STEPHEN, YOUR MOTOR MOUTH DISEASE DOES IT EFFECT -- UH, EVERYTHING.
WELL, NO. JUST LIKE THIS STUFF. AUTOMATIC.
