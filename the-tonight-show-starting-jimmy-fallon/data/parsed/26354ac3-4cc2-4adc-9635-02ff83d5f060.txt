ONE WEEK I'M IN THE BADLANDS RIDING AROUND WITH TEDDY ROOSEVELT'S GREAT-GRANDSON LEARNING ABOUT TEDDY ROOSEVELT. THE NEXT WEEK I'M WITH PROFESSIONAL CUDDLERS. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR LIVING AS ACTUAL PROFESSIONAL CUDDLERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN? WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN?
THEY'RE LIKE PROSTITUTES WITH COMMITMENT ISSUES. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY JUST DON'T GO ALL THE WAY.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T GO ALL -- OKAY. BUT THEY'LL CUDDLE WITH YOU.
THEY'LL CUDDLE. AND THEY'LL SNUGGLE, BUT NOTHING MORE. AND THEN I WENT UP -- I WAS A A WINDOW WASHER DOWNTOWN ON ONE OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BUILDINGS THE OTHER DAY. THAT WAS WILD.
Jimmy: WOW. HOW HIGH WERE YOU UP?
58 STORIES. I WENT UP 58 STORIES. AND THEY SAY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU -- WHEN YOU GO FOR THE FIRST TIME, EVEN THE TOUGHEST WINDOW WASHERS GET CHICKEN LEGS. AND THE SENSATION -- I WANT TO BE ANATOMICALLY CORRECT HERE -- OF YOUR NARDS COMING UP INTO YOUR THROAT, BASICALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND I WAS --
Jimmy: I JUST WANT TO GOOGLE THAT, MAKE SURE YOU'RE RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S CORRECT. YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT THAT IS?
YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. AND SO WOULD YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN?
I WOULD. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT PRETENDING TO BE FEARLESS. THERE ARE THINGS I'M TERRIFIED OF. BUT I THINK YOU'RE EITHER AFRAID OF HEIGHTS OR YOU'RE NOT, AND I JUST WASN'T AFRAID. I DID GET ONE GREAT BIT OF ADVICE FROM A WINDOW WASHER WHO SHALL REMAIN ANONYMOUS. I SAID, "YOU GUYS GO OUT FOR FOUR HOURS AT A TIME. WHAT IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM? YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE TO RELIEVE YOURSELF?" AND THE WINDOW WASHER SAID TO ME, "I TELL MY LOVED ONES DON'T EVER WALK UNDER A WINDOW WASHING BASKET IN THE CITY." [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD LESSON, EVERYONE. LEARN THAT LESSON.
IT'S NOT A REFRESHING MIST. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'VE GOT TO SAY, YOU'RE VERY TALENTED BUT YOU'RE ALSO VERY TALENTED AT COOKING. AND VERY INTERESTED IN THIS. "MY GRANDMOTHER'S RAVIOLI" HAS ITS FOURTH SEASON STARTING RIGHT NOW. AND WHY DID YOU DO THIS SHOW, "MY GRANDMOTHER'S RAVIOLI"?
HONESTLY, I DID IT OUT OF GUILT. I HAD THIS AMAZING GRANDMOTHER, REALLY, A TERRIFIC WOMAN. AND I DID A LOT WITH HER, BUT I NEVER HELPED HER IN THE KITCHEN. AND THEN I GOT TO MY EARLY 40s AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO COOK AND IT WAS JUST PATHETIC AND I THOUGHT, "I DON'T HAVE MY GRANDMOTHER AROUND ANYMORE SO I'LL LEARN FROM EVERYBODY ELSE'S GRANDPARENTS HOW TO COOK." SO I GO AROUND THE COUNTRY, GOING INTO THEIR HOMES. AND IT'S -- IT'S AWESOME. I MEAN, GRANDPARENTS -- AT LEAST ONES ON OUR SHOW ARE AT A A PLACE IN THEIR LIVES WHERE THEY REALLY DON'T CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF THEM. SO THEY'LL SAY WHAT'S ON THEIR MIND, AND THEY'VE GOTTEN TO A A PLACE WHERE THEY CARE ABOUT A A FEW THINGS. THEY KNOW WHAT MATTERS. AND IT'S -- IT MAKES ME WANT TO BE A GRANDPARENT, AND I DON'T HAVE KIDS SO IF I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO BECOME A GRANDPARENT WITHOUT BECOMING A PARENT FIRST. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK. I COOK WITH MY GRANDMOTHER ALL OF THE TIME.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE WITH HER?
Jimmy: SHE WOULD MAKE NORWEGIAN MEATBALLS LIKE THOSE IKEA MEATBALLS.
THOSE ARE SWEDISH.
Jimmy: OH, THEY'RE SWEDISH. BUT WE'RE -- SHE WAS NORWEGIAN SO SHE CALLS THEM NORWEGIAN MEATBALLS. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE MAKES THE RULES. IT'S HER PLACE, YEAH. I ALSO LEARNED THE THREE-SECOND RULE, WHERE IF YOU DROP SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR, SHE WOULD PICK IT UP, BLESS IT TO GOD, AND THEN PUT IT BACK IN THE POT. AND I GO, "REALLY?" LIKE, JESUS WAS OUR PURELL OR SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHY -- BUT WE WOULD JUST EAT IT ANYWAY. SHE DOESN'T CARE. BUT IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. I ACTUALLY GET INTO THAT. SO I LOVE WATCHING THE SHOW AND I LOVE ALL THESE GRANDMAS OUT THERE THAT ARE TEACHING YOU THINGS. IT'S JUST A SUPER FUN, FUN SHOW TO WATCH. I HAVE A PICTURE OF YOU AND YOUR -- THIS IS YOU AND YOUR GRANDMA.
THAT'S MAMA. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] AND SHE WAS -- [ APPLAUSE ] SHE WORKED FULL-TIME AT A D.C. DEPARTMENT STORE UNTIL SHE WAS 87 AND SHE STILL MADE THESE BIG SUNDAY MEALS FOR US. AND FOR ITALIANS, A SUNDAY DINNER IS AT AROUND 2:00 P.M. LIKE AFTER MASS ON SUNDAY.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
BUT SHE WAS AMAZING.
