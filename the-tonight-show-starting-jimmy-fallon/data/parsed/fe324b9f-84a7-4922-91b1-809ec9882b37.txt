LISTEN TO THIS, YOU GUYS, A A DONOR THAT GAVE RICK PERRY $5 MILLION SAID THIS WEEK HE WANTS HIS MONEY BACK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH ONLY GOT WORSE WHEN RICK PERRY WAS LIKE, "BUT I SPENT IT ON THESE MAGIC BEANS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND THIS ISN'T GOOD HERE. I SAW THAT ACCORDING TO THE NEW POLL, ALMOST HALF OF FLORIDA VOTERS THINK THEIR OWN CANDIDATES, JEB BUSH AND MARCO RUBIO, SHOULD DROP OUT OF THE RACE. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WHILE THE OTHER HALF OF FLORIDA KEEPS ASKING WHAT HAPPENED TO EISENHOWER. [ LAUGHTER ] "I LOVE IKE. WHERE DID HE GO?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CHECK THIS OUT. MARK ZUCKERBERG ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT FACEBOOK IS WORKING ON A DISLIKE BUTTON. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] NOW THE OPTIONS WILL BE "LIKE" OR "DISLIKE." YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. I STILL FEEL, IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ENOUGH. IT'S TOO BLACK AND WHITE. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S MORE. SO, WE CAME UP WITH MORE BUTTONS THAT SAY HOW WE REALLY FEEL ABOUT THINGS THAT WE SEE ON FACEBOOK.

OH, THAT'S GREAT. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE BEING INTERVIEWED.
NOW, LOOK, THAT'S OKAY, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T START TALKING OVER ME WHEN I'M --
HERE'S QUESTION ONE.
--TRYING TO MAKE A POINT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU RECENTLY SAID, QUOTE, MR. TRUMP INSULTS AND DISMISSES WOMEN. BUT TELL ME, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO HELP WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY?
LOOK, DONALD, I HAVE SPENT MY ENTIRE CAREER FIGHTING FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS. I'LL PUSH FOR EQUAL PAY IN THE WORK PLACE. [ CHEERS ] PROTECT WOMEN'S HEALTH AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, AND MAKE QUALITY AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE A A REALITY FOR FAMILIES. [ CHEERS ] THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE. THAT'S WHAT I'M FIGHTING FOR. AND YOU KNOW, I'M CURIOUS, DONALD. WHAT IS YOUR STANCE ON WOMEN'S ISSUES?
LOOK, I KNOW A LOT OF WOMEN, AND THEY ALL HAVE ISSUES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT QUESTION. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GET YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
WELL, IT'S A LONG CAMPAIGN, AND I'M TRAVELING ACROSS THE NATION. I'M LISTENING TO PEOPLE'S STORIES. I'M CONFIDENT THAT AMERICANS WILL SEE THEY CAN COUNT ON ME TO DELIVER FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES.
SEE, YOU SOUND LIKE A ROBOT. [ LAUGHTER ] BLEEP BLOORP BLEEP, DOES NOT COMPUTE. YOU WANT TO WIN, HERE'S WHAT YOU GOTTA DO. FIRST, YELL. [ LAUGHTER ] I YELL ALL THE TIME. IN FACT, THIS PHONE ISN'T EVEN PLUGGED IN. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S JUST ME YELLING. AND YOU'RE HEARING ME. NEXT -- [ LAUGHTER ] PICK THREE THINGS EVERYONE LOVES AND SAY THAT YOU HATE THEM. WATCH. PUPPIES -- STUPID. [ LAUGHTER ] RAINBOWS, TOTAL LOSERS. FALL FOLIAGE, TREE PUBERTY. [ LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU WRITING ALL THIS DOWN?
UM, HOLD ON. LET ME JUST GRAB MY PEN.
OKAY. [ CHEERS ]
OKAY. OKAY, I GOT IT.
NEXT QUESTION. IMMIGRATION. WALL OR GIANT WALL? [ LAUGHTER ]
AW, COME ON, DONALD. YOU KNOW AMERICA WAS BUILT BY PEOPLE WHO CAME HERE, AND THEY WORKED THEIR HEARTS OUT FOR A A BETTER LIFE. THAT'S WHAT MANY IMMIGRANTS ARE DOING TODAY. THEIR DREAM IS TO BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TRYING TO STOP THEM. I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK SO HARD FOR SOMETHING, TO BE SO CLOSE TO GETTING IT, BUT THEN SOMEONE POPS UP OUT OF NOWHERE AND TRIES TO TAKE IT ALL AWAY?
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS? [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT I THINK HE'S LOSING HIS HAIR.
WELL, AT LEAST HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE STRAND THAT HE TWIRLS OVER HIS HEAD LIKE A SOFT SERVE AT DAIRY QUEEN ALL THE TIME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
TOUPEE. I MEAN, TOUCHé. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, YOU'RE WELCOME FOR THIS INTERVIEW. I JUST REALLY HELPED YOUR CAMPAIGN. YOUR POLL NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE FANTASTIC. THEY'RE GOING TO BE BIG.

Jimmy: WE ARE JOINED RIGHT NOW BY A FORMER FIRST LADY, SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND SECRETARY OF STATE. SHE'S ALSO A BEST-SELLING AUTHOR, A GRANDMOTHER AND THE LEADING DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. PLEASE GIVE A WARM WELCOME TO HILLARY CLINTON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

IT IS. THAT'S RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: NOW, I HAVE A LOT TO GET TO HERE. THIS, OF COURSE, TONIGHT WAS THE GOP DEBATE.
YES, THAT'S TRUE. SECOND ONE.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE SECOND GOP DEBATE.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: THE TWO LEADERS OVER THERE ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, ONE IS A REAL ESTATE MOGUL.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: THE OTHER GUY IS A A NEUROSURGEON.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HE'S IN THE LEAD, THE OTHER CANDIDATE. YOU WERE A SENATOR, YOU WERE A A FIRST LADY. SECRETARY OF STATE.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU HAVE TOO MUCH EXPERIENCE TO BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IS THAT POSSIBLE? THEY HAVE NO EXPERIENCE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY UP TO THE VOTERS TO DECIDE. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YOU CAN JUST, SORT OF, THROW YOUR HEAD INTO THE FUTURE AND YOU COULD HAVE THE WHITE HOUSE RENAMED THE TRUMP HOUSE.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, SURE.
AND YOU COULD HAVE DR. CARSON DOING SURGERY IN THE BASEMENT.
Jimmy: WE COULD MAKE IT ALL WORK.
IT COULD ALL WORK. WE'RE ADAPTABLE AS AMERICANS. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM US. RIGHT? WE CAN GET IT DONE.
Jimmy: WE COULD DO IT. TRUMP, IS TRUMP GOING TO MAKE IT? IS HE GOING TO LAST ALL THE WAY? HOW LONG DO YOU THINK HE WILL LAST. DO YOU FEEL LIKE HE'S GONNA GO -- ARE YOU JUST MAYBE, WAITING BACK, LIKE ROPE- A-DOPE STYLE? UNTIL HE JUST GETS TIRED, AND THEN HE'S TIRED, AND THEN YOU GO, ALL RIGHT, OUT OF THE WAY, BUDDY?
WELL, LOOK, I THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO GO AS LONG AS HE WANTS TO GO. AND MORE POWER TO HIM. THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. IF YOU'RE OVER 35 AND YOU'RE ELIGIBLE AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, YOU CAN ACTUALLY RUN FOR PRESIDENT. AND SO, HE'S MAKING THE MOST OUT OF IT. I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME WATCHING IT. I FIND IT -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DO. I FIND IT AMAZING. I MEAN, YOU WERE SAYING HOW MUCH EXPERIENCE AND ALL THAT. AND YOU KNOW, I KNOW HOW HARD THIS JOB IS. I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT WELL. I OBVIOUSLY WATCHED MY HUSBAND. I WORKED WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. SO I'M JUST SITTING THERE THINKING, IMAGINE, YOU KNOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU'RE IN THE KREMLIN. AND SOMEBODY COMES RUSHING IN AND GOES, "OH, MY GOSH. DID YOU HEAR WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID TODAY?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU GO, OH, MY GOODNESS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MIGHT CAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE TO JUST CALM DOWN BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO GET IT TO BE TOO EXCITABLE.
Jimmy: SO THEY'RE ALL GOING TO TRY TO BRING IT DOWN.
JUST TRY TO BRING IT DOWN. YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE GOOD, I'M NOT SURE.
Jimmy: WE DON'T KNOW.
I LOVE SCENARIOS.
Jimmy: OH GOOD, I LIKE IT --
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: I THINK YOU'RE VERY, VERY, VERY TOUGH. I KNOW YOU'RE A MOTHER AND I KNOW YOU AS A GRANDMOTHER AS WELL, BUT YOU'RE A TOUGH MOTHER.
A TOUGH MOTHER? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO. NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, I MEANT THAT IN THE BEST WAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU ARE, I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULDN'T MESS WITH YOU. NO, I WOULDN'T MESS WITH YOU. I WOULDN'T FIGHT WITH YOU. YOU'RE LIKE IF RONDA ROUSEY SHOPPED AT ANN TAYLOR LOFT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING BY THAT? A LOT OF PEOPLE GO LIKE, ARE YOU TOUGH ENOUGH TO BE PRESIDENT? ARE YOU TOUGH ENOUGH TO BE PRESIDENT?
YES I THINK SO. [ CHEERS ] BUT, YOU KNOW, LOOK, YOU'VE GOT TO BE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO BE A GOOD PRESIDENT. YOU'VE GOT TO START WITH REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH, AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN HELP EVERYBODY HAVE A BETTER SHOT AT A FUTURE THEY DESERVE. THAT'S MY, YOU KNOW, MISSION IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND AS PRESIDENT, BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD. AND THERE ARE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T AGREE WITH US. AND MIGHT WANT TO CAUSE SOME MISCHIEF. SO, YOU DO HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO DO IT IN A SENSIBLE, SMART WAY. NOT BULLYING, BUT YOU KNOW, WITH A LITTLE MORE DIPLOMACY. I THINK THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE RIGHT COMBINATION.
Jimmy: SPEAKING OF TRUMP -- [ LAUGHTER ]
WHICH YOU SEEM TO DO A LOT OF, JIMMY.
Jimmy: HE'S THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO OUR SHOW. IN EVERY MONOLOGUE.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ABLE TO LET HIM TOUCH, LET YOU TOUCH HIS HAIR?
Jimmy: HIS REAL HAIR?
HIS REAL HAIR. HAVE YOU EVER REALLY TOUCHED IT?
Jimmy: HE'S ONLY BEEN HERE, IT FEELS LIKE A HOLOGRAM WHEN HE'S HERE. I'VE NEVER TOUCHED HIS REAL, I DON'T KNOW, I THINK IT IS REAL HAIR. HE NEVER LET ME TOUCH HIS HAIR.
YOU WANT TO TOUCH MINE?
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
OKAY, GO AHEAD. [ CHEERS ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S REAL. IT'S REAL. IT'S REAL. IT'S REAL. ♪♪ IT'S REAL AND IT'S GOT WAVE, AND IT'S FANTASTIC, YOU GUYS. AND IT SMELLS GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU CAN'T SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE COLOR. BUT THE HAIR IS REAL.
Jimmy: BUT YOU'RE GETTING CLOSE.
IT'S GETTING CLOSE.
Jimmy: WE CAN WORK ON THAT.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: HE WAS SAYING, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU. WE HAD HIM ON THE SHOW. HE WAS GREAT. WE TALKED TO HIM. HE GOES, "YOU KNOW, HILLARY CLINTON USES THE TELEPROMPTER."
YEAH.
Jimmy: SCRIPTED TOO MUCH.
RIGHT. WELL, YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE USED THEM FROM TIME TO TIME. I LEARNED THAT FROM WATCHING HOW SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS. BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS TO SAY, AND HE REALLY IS INTENT UPON DELIVERING IT. BUT I COULD GO MORE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A HUGE ELECTION. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. LET'S GET RID OF THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T AGREE WITH US AND ONLY TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO DO. YOU COULD DO THAT WITHOUT A A TELEPROMPTER.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S PERFECT, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS A GOOD IMPRESSION. IF I NEED SOMEBODY, I'M GOING TO CALL YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] I'M GONNA GO UNSCRIPTED. I'M GONNA GO UNSCRIPTED.
OH, GOOD. GET RID OF THE SCRIPT, GET RID OF THE TELEPROMPTER.
Jimmy: YEAH, I'M GOOD.
JUST BE LIBERATED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHERE WERE WE? CAN I JUST TALK ABOUT THE E-MAIL SCANDAL?
SURE.
Jimmy: WHAT IS IN THE E-MAILS? CAN YOU JUST SAY WHAT'S IN THE E-MAILS? THAT'S ALL WE WANT TO KNOW. IF YOU TELL US WHAT'S IN THE E-MAILS I'LL GET OVER IT.
YEAH YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT WE'RE THINKING IS PROBABLY MUCH WORSE. ARE YOU JUST LIKE TYPING IN ALL CAPS? IS IT EMBARRASSING?
A LOT OF IT'S SPELLING.
Jimmy: IS IT LIKE MY MOM WHERE EVERYTHING IS IN THE SUBJECT LINE AND NOTHING IS IN THE BODY? [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, IT'S KIND OF A A VARIATION ON THAT. AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THEM THAT ARE ALREADY OUT THERE. MOST PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN BORED AFTER READING TEN OR 12, BECAUSE THEY'RE BORING. THEY'RE KIND OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE WE DOING? HOW DO WE DO IT, WHEN IS THE MEETING? NOW, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE THAT HAS COME TO LIGHT BECAUSE THIS WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I HAD TO TALK ABOUT IT ON E-MAIL. AND THAT IS I WAS ASKED IF I COULD GET GEFILTE FISH INTO ISRAEL IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE USED IN TIME FOR PASSOVER. AND, SO --
Jimmy: THAT WAS THE GEFILTE FISH.
THAT WAS THE GEFILTE FISH EMAIL.
Jimmy: WELL, HERE'S THE THING, EVERYONE WAS SAYING, OH SOME OF THESE ARE TOP SECRET E-MAILS. AND THEY GO, TOP SECRET, AND THEY GO TOP SECRET, AND WE GOT INTO THE -- HACKED INTO THINGS. AND THEY GO, "BUT WE'RE WERE GOING TO RELEASE THEM, AND WE'LL LET EVERYONE KNOW WHAT HILLARY --" AND I GO, "WAIT, DO WE WANT EVERYONE KNOWING WHAT THE TOP SECRET E-MAIL IS?"
LOOK, I SAID I HAVE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY. I'M TRYING TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE, BUT NOTHING THAT WAS SENT AT THE TIME OR RECEIVED WAS SECRET. THIS IS ALL RETROACTIVE. IT WOULD BE, IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO EXPLAIN, BUT SOMETIMES DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARGUE ABOUT WHAT SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BE WHAT'S CALLED CLASSIFIED. THEN THEY SAY, HEY IT WASN'T AT THE TIME, BUT MAYBE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. SOMEONE ELSE SAYS, NO, I DISAGREE. THEY SAY, TO BE SAFE, MAYBE WE OUGHT TO CROSS OUT SOME OF THE WORDS. IT WASN'T AT THE TIME. AND THE STUFF THAT'S IN IT I THINK IS REALLY BORING PEOPLE. WHICH KIND OF HURTS MY FEELINGS.
Jimmy: NO, NO, VERY EXCITING. THE GEFILTE FISH IS UNBELIEVABLE. VERY EXCITING E-MAIL. I THINK THE HEADLINE -- THEY MISSED A BIG HEADLINE. THE HEADLINE SHOULD BE "GRANDMA KNOWS HOW TO USE AN E-MAIL." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S AMAZING. AGAIN, MY MOM HAS NO CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON. TEXTS ARE LIKE, BLOW HER MIND. BUT HERE YOU ARE, YOU'RE VERY GOOD WITH SOCIAL MEDIA. I WANT TO ASK YOU, YOU'RE USING VINE. YOU'RE DOING VINES, YOU'RE DOING SELFIES. YOU'RE ON TWITTER. YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THESE THINGS, YOU KNOW WHAT THESE THING ARE?
YEAH, I DO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: OKAY GOOD.
NOW, I DON'T DO THEM ALL MYSELF.
Jimmy: NO.
OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, I WORK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE I'M ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME. THINGS POP UP AND HEY, WHAT ABOUT THIS. SOMEBODY SAYS THE SAME TO ME. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT IS THE WAY TO COMMUNICATE. AND YOU HAVE TO BE, YOU KNOW, EXCUSE ME, INVOLVED IN HEARING WHAT'S ON PEOPLE'S MINDS AND RESPONDING. I ACTUALLY LIKE IT. I THINK IT'S A GREAT WAY FOR PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE SHARING IDEAS. THEY'RE PART OF A BIGGER COMMUNITY THAN YOU COULD EVER BE IN REALITY. IT'S THE ONLINE COMMUNITY.
Jimmy: BUT YOU TOOK A SELFIE THE OTHER DAY WITH KIM KARDASHIAN.
I DID. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DID.
Jimmy: MY QUESTION IS, DID YOU KNOW WHO KIM KARDASHIAN WAS WHEN YOU TOOK THE SELFIE?
OF COURSE, I DID. ABSOLUTELY. YEAH.
Jimmy: I HAVE A FOLLOW UP --
AND I HAVE TO SAY, SHE AND HER HUSBAND, KANYE, CAME TO ONE OF MY --
Jimmy: WHAT WAS HIS NAME AGAIN?
CAME TO ONE OF MY FUND-RAISERS IN L.A. I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE COMING. THEY WERE JUST DELIGHTFUL. I REALLY ENJOYED MEETING THEM AND TALKING WITH THEM. AND SHE'S A PRO ABOUT THE SELFIE DEAL. SHE SAYS TO ME --
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SHE'S PRETTY GOOD AT THAT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU WANT TO TAKE A SELFIE? I SAID SURE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: PRETTY GOOD, YEAH.
I GOT TO TELL YOU, JIMMY. YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE SELFIES WITH ME, AS YOU MIGHT GUESS. YOU KNOW, AT EVENTS TODAY, YOU FINISH TALKING TO PEOPLE, YOU DO A TOWN HALL, YOU GO DOWN, YOU SHAKE HANDS. IT USED TO BE SAY, WAIT A A MINUTE, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT OUR NUCLEAR FORCE POSTURE MIGHT BE. NOW THEY SAY, CAN WE TAKE A A SELFIE? I SAY, OF COURSE WE CAN. AND IT'S A HUGE PART OF THE CULTURE.
Jimmy: DO YOU REMEMBER THIS STORY, 'CAUSE I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS ONE TIME WHEN I MET YOU. YOU TOLD ME A GREAT STORY WHEN YOU WERE FIRST LADY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S FASCINATING TO ME. YOU WENT OUT ON YOUR OWN FOR A A WALK. YOU LIKE TO WALK.
RIGHT. I LOVE TO WALK.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND YOU WERE WALKING IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THERE WAS A TOURIST THAT WAS TAKING A PHOTO OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: DO YOU REMEMBER THIS STORY?
WELL, I WAS -- I WALKED OUT. I WAS AT THE BACK OF THE WHITE HOUSE. AND I WAS HEADING ACROSS THE MALL. I LIKED TO GO FOR WALKS.
Jimmy: NO ONE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE.
NOBODY KNOWS WHO I AM. I HAVE A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES, I HAVE A BASEBALL CAP ON. AND THERE'S -- IT LOOKS LIKE A A FAMILY OF TOURISTS, AND I'M WAITING TO CROSS THE STREET, AND THEY'RE STANDING THERE AND THEY SAY, "WOULD YOU MIND TAKING A PICTURE OF US IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE?" [ LAUGHTER ] I SAID, "I'D BE HAPPY TO." SO I GET THEM POSED UP. THIS IS BACK IN THE '90s. YOU DIDN'T HAVE A CELL PHONE.
Jimmy: EXACTLY, A REAL CAMERA.
IT WAS A REAL CAMERA. TOOK THE PICTURE AND OFF I WENT. [ LAUGHTER ]

THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND I WAS ASKING PEOPLE FOR ADVICE. AND I ASKED YOU FOR ADVICE. AND DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR ADVICE?
I DO, I DO. AND I THINK YOU AND I WENT OFF. AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER YOU DO, READ TO YOUR BABY. AND JUST READ AND TALK AND EVEN SING. AND YOU COULD DO ALL OF THAT. BUT ESPECIALLY READING TO YOUR BABY.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND I WAS LIKE, GREAT, BUT SHE'S AN INFANT. I DON'T THINK SHE'LL UNDERSTAND ANYTHING I'M SAYING.
YEAH, I KNOW. YOU HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: BUT YOU WERE LIKE, NO SIT DOWN. I'M GONNA TELL YOU. THIS IS REALLY -- REAL ADVICE.
IT IS REAL ADVICE. I MEAN, YOU -- YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE IT. AND IT REALLY DOES MAKE SUCH A A DIFFERENCE TO YOUR CHILD. AND PEOPLE SAY, WELL, WHY WOULD I READ TO THIS INFANT? YOU KNOW, WHAT DO THEY UNDERSTAND? THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND -- YOU'RE LITERALLY BUILDING THEIR BRAIN. YOU KNOW, 80% OF YOUR BRAIN IS PHYSICALLY FORMED BY THE TIME YOU'RE THREE. AND YOU'RE LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR THE VOCABULARY THAT YOU WILL ONE DAY SEE AS A A CHILD LEARNS TO SPEAK. SO READ, READ, READ. AND YOU DID IT. AND I HOPE EVERYBODY WHO WATCHES YOU DOES IT.
Jimmy: NO, I DID DO IT. AND HONEST TO GOSH, THEIR FAVORITE BOOK "THE ART OF THE DEAL" BY DONALD TRUMP. I DON'T KNOW WHY. IT'S SO WEIRD.
THE ILLUSTRATED VERSION?
Jimmy: IS THERE ANY OTHER VERSION? A LOT OF PICTURES. PLEASE, IT'S IN MY HOUSE. I NEED A LOT OF PICTURES.
BUT YOU WROTE A BOOK.
Jimmy: I DID. I WROTE A BOOK CALLED "YOUR BABY'S FIRST WORD WILL BE DADA."
YEAH, YOU REALLY MADE SURE THAT WINNIE'S FIRST WORD WAS DADA.
Jimmy: REALLY, I TRIED AS HARD AS I POSSIBLY --
SHOULD BE SENT INTO THE WILDERNESS.
Jimmy: I DID. AND WE REALLY WORKED HARD. TODAY WAS THE FIRST DAY OF PRESCHOOL.
OH, MY GOSH. HOW ARE YOU DOING? I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE LIKE WORKING.

GREAT.
Jimmy: TRUMP HAS IMMIGRATION.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND BERNIE SANDERS HAS BIG BUSINESS.

RAISING AMERICANS' INCOMES, GETTING MORE MONEY INTO YOUR PAYCHECK SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A A BETTER CHANCE AND A BETTER SHOT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SO, YOU HAVE INCOME.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HOW DO YOU PLAN TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE?
I'VE GOT A PLAN SO THAT IF YOU GO TO A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO BORROW MONEY TO PAY TUITION. AND I HAVE A PLAN TO LOWER THE DEBT. REDUCE THE INTEREST RATES, GIVE PEOPLE MORE OF A CHANCE TO PAY IT OFF BY DOING SOME KIND OF SERVICE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND PUT A DATE CERTAIN WHERE YOU'RE DONE. YOU'VE GOTTA TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THE TWIN PROBLEMS OF COLLEGE IS NOT AFFORDABLE AND THE DEBT IS JUST SO BURDENSOME. SO, I'M ADDRESSING BOTH.

Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW IF I KNEW THAT, NO.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME. I DON'T KNOW WHY, I JUST START LAUGHING WHEN I SEE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE ALLOWED TO LAUGH. THAT'S WHAT THE SHOW'S ALL ABOUT. HAVE A GOOD TIME.

YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CUT ALL OF THIS OUT.
Jimmy: NO, WE WON'T. WE'LL LEAVE ALL OF IT IN. WE'LL LEAVE ALL OF IT IN. YOU WON -- YOU WON. YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU CAN BUY TROPHIES. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN BUY A TROPHY, YEAH? OKAY, LET'S JUST GET OFF THE TROPHY THING. WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE TROPHY THING. IT'S FINE. YOU JUST KEEP CRYING AND LAUGHING AND THEN I'LL JUST TALK. I WANT YOU TO HAVE FUN. NO, I WANT YOU TO REALLY TRY AND ENJOY YOURSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU JUST TRY TO FROWN? THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK, EITHER. YOU'RE TRYING TO GET SAD?
OKAY.
Jimmy: NO, THIS IS GOOD.

Jimmy: YOU GOT IT TOGETHER.
NO, THAT GUY. I CAN HEAR THAT GUY LAUGHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HAVE HIM REMOVED. WHOEVER'S LAUGHING, HAVE HIM REMOVED! THROW HIM OUT OF THE THEATER. LET'S GET INTO SOMETHING ELSE. LET'S TALK ABOUT "FIFTY SHADES OF GREY." WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: BEING THE BIGGEST HIT IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IS THERE MUSIC PLAYING? I HEAR MUSIC CRANKING.
Jimmy: I CAN HEAR THE MUSIC, BUT WE'LL JUST PRETEND WE CAN'T HEAR THE MUSIC, OKAY?
OKAY.
Jimmy: EVEN THOUGH IT'S THUMPING THROUGH THE WALL.
THAT'S HILLARY'S DRESSING ROOM.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT! [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TELL HER TO GO HOME. TELL HER TO GO HOME. ALL RIGHT, NOW LOOK. "50 SHADES" MADE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. OH, MY GOSH. ARE YOU EXCITED? THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
IT WAS -- YEAH, IT WAS AMAZING.
Jimmy: IT'S YOUR FIRST BIG FILM, AND IT'S THE BIGGEST -- ONE OF THE BIGGEST FILMS EVER.
YEAH. BUT NOW HERE YOU ARE IN "BLACK MASS."
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S THIS GIANT MOVIE. WHITEY BULGER IS JOHNNY DEPP. IT WAS JUST FANTASTIC.
JOHNNY DEPP IS WHITEY BULGER.
Jimmy: YEAH, I SAID WHITEY BULGER, IT'S JOHNNY DEPP.
OH.
Jimmy: I SLUR MY WORDS SOMETIMES.
OKAY.
Jimmy: I WAS DRINKING WITH HILLARY. [ LAUGHTER ]
ME, TOO.
Jimmy: SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. JOHNNY DEPP IS WHITEY BULGER. AND HE'S VERY CONVINCING. AND YOU PLAY WHITEY BULGER'S OR JOHNNY DEPP'S GIRLFRIEND.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, GIRLFRIEND, MOTHER OF HIS CHILD.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE VERY, VERY GOOD. YOU'RE FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I LIKE YOU. I REALLY LIKE YOU IN THE MOVIE.
THANKS, MAN.
Jimmy: YOU'RE FANTASTIC. AND YOU HAVE A BOSTON ACCENT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHICH I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU -- DO YOU KNOW ANYONE FROM BOSTON?
YEAH, IF YOU MESS IT UP, THEY -- THEY MIGHT KILL YA.
Jimmy: NO, YEAH. NO, NO, NO, THEY WON'T GO THAT FAR, BUT THEY WILL DISOWN YOU, THEY WON'T TALK TO YOU. PEOPLE IN MOVIES TRY THE BOSTON ACCENT AND IT DOESN'T WORK.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IF IT'S NOT PERFECT, THEY GO GET OUTTA HERE. THAT'S BAD. I MEAN, THAT'S NOT EVEN THAT GOOD. I CAN'T DO THE BOSTON ACCENT. GET OUTTA HERE.
GET OUTTA HERE.
Jimmy: GET OUTTA HERE. SEE YEAH, YOU DO IT, YOU'RE SO CALM ABOUT IT. YEAH, BUT WHAT DID YOU DO? DID YOU STUDY WITH A DIALECT COACH? DID YOU FREAK OUT? DID YOU LIVE IN BOSTON?
I DID. I WORKED WITH A DIALECT COACH A A LITTLE BIT. BUT I HAVE A THING WITH EAVESDROPPING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO, BUT YOU EAVESDROP, YOU LISTEN TO PEOPLE, WHERE DO YOU GO? LIKE TRAIN STATIONS?
WELL, NO, YEAH. WELL, IF I WAS AT RESTAURANTS OR, YOU KNOW, PLACES I WOULD JUST LISTEN TO THE ACCENTS AND THEN PRACTICE.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? SO, SAY THIS MOVIE WAS NOT WHITEY BULGER. SAY IT WAS SET IN FRANCE. COULD YOU DO WHITEY BULGER'S GIRLFRIEND?
YEAH, I COULD DO THAT.
Jimmy: WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE?
MONSIER WHITEY. MONSIER BLANC. MONSIEUR BLANC? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IS THAT FRENCH FOR WHITE? YEAH, BLANC-Y? BLANC-Y, UNE BAGUETTE, BLANC-Y.
BLANC-Y, WHY OOH?
Jimmy: WHY?
WHY DO YOU TO DO THESE THINGS? WHY OOH?
Jimmy: WHY OOH? THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
WHY OOH?
Jimmy: WHY OOH? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT'S -- THAT'S HOW YOU SPEAK FRENCH. WHY OOH?
OOH.
Jimmy: WHAT IF IT WAS SET IN AUSTRALIA?
OKAY, OKAY. SO, WHITEY, IT'S SO WEIRD.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
WHAT YOU'RE DOIN' IS SO WEIRD. IT'S LIKE NOT GOOD. NOT GOOD. SO, BAD.
Jimmy: SO, BAD. ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IF IT WAS IN THE SOUTH, LAST ONE.
WHITEY, WHY -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN THIS MOVIE. WHY AREN'T -- WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT PECAN PIE?
WHITEY! WHITEY, YOU GOTTA STOP KILLIN' PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SEE, THAT'S -- DAKOTA JOHNSON, KNOWS HOW TO DO IT. THANK YOU. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THE STORY ABOUT WHITEY BULGER, IT'S A TRUE STORY. CAN YOU SET IT UP? CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT AT ALL?
IT'S ABOUT WHITEY BULGER, WHO MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH THE FBI TO BRING DOWN THE ITALIANS IN BOSTON. AND ALSO HE, YOU KNOW, DID A A LOT OF TERRIBLE THINGS.
Jimmy: YEAH, NO, YEAH, HE'S A VERY -- YEAH, HE'S A TOUGH, TOUGH, TOUGH --
BASED ON THE BOOK "BLACK MASS." HERE'S A CLIP OF HER AND JOHNNY DEPP IN "BLACK MASS." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
IS THAT WHY YOU THINK YOU GOT IN TROUBLE?E 'CAUSE YOU PUNCHED HIM IN THE FACE? ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE DEAL. YOU DID NOT GET IN TROUBLE BECAUSE YOU PUNCHED THIS SNEAKY BRAT IN THE FACE, NOT AT ALL. YOU GOT IN TROUBLE BECAUSE YOU PUNCHED A SNEAKY BRAT IN THE FACE IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE.
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO BE TEACHING YOUR KIDS.
NO, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WHAT I SHOULD BE TELLING THEM, VIV. SO THE LESSON YOU GOTTA LEARN IS IF NOBODY SEES IT, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
