THE WAY IT WORKS IS, YOU OPEN THE CARD, YOU ENTER YOUR NAME AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER -- AND THEN, YOU'RE SIGNED UP FOR OBAMACARE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S JUST REALLY A SURROGATE. HAPPY HOLIDAYS, SUCKERS! HAPPY HOLIDAYS, SUCKERS. VERY AMAZING. SPEAKING OF OBAMA, I SAW THAT ON SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY, THE PRESIDENT WENT SHOPPING AT A A BOOKSTORE AND BOUGHT 17 BOOKS -- INCLUDING "THE LAUGHING MONSTERS," "BEING MORTAL" AND "HEART OF DARKNESS." [ LAUGHTER ] OR AS THE CASHIER PUT IT, "ARE YOU OKAY, MAN?" "CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL SOUL," DO YOU WANT TO GET THAT? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND THIS IS NICE. THE CHRISTMAS TREE, THE WHITE HOUSE CHRISTMAS TREE, ARRIVED THIS WEEKEND. IT'S A 19-FOOT-TALL WHITE FIR FROM PENNSYLVANIA. AND FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO COME OUT AND TAKE A LOOK. WATCH.
THIS IS A BIG ONE.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, IT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ANY TROUBLE HOPPING THE FENCE. IT'S A TREE AND IT'S HERE. SO, YEAH, ANYTHING, YEAH. HERE'S SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS HERE. REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS ARE PREDICTING THAT THE TOP THREE GOP CANDIDATES FOR THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RACE WILL BE RAND PAUL, JEB BUSH AND CHRIS CHRISTIE. [ SCATTERED CHEERS ] THAT'S ALSO ACCORDING TO THE NAMES TATTOOED ON HILLARY CLINTON'S RIGHT FOREARM. [ LAUGHTER ] BURNING A TATTOO IN HER ARM?
Steve: WITH A CIGARETTE.
Jimmy: A BIT OF A SCANDAL HERE. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN BRIBED A SOCCER OFFICIAL WITH A PICASSO PAINTING SO HE WOULD SUPPORT RUSSIA'S BID TO HOST THE 2018 WORLD CUP. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] YEAH, PUTIN WAS LIKE, "IT WASN'T PICASSO. JUST PICTURE OF WHAT HIS FACE WOULD LOOK LIKE IF HE SAID NO. HIS EYE HERE, NOSE UP HERE." [ LAUGHTER ] LAUGHING, IN THE QUOTE, HE WAS LAUGHING.
Steve: EVIL, EVIL QUOTE.
Jimmy: WELL, NOW THAT THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON IS HERE, A LOT OF BUSINESSES ARE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SHOPLIFTERS. AND IN CASE YOU'RE WORRIED, "GOOD MORNING AMERICA" FOUND A A MASTER SHOPLIFTER TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SHOPLIFTING. TAKE A LOOK.
THERE'S ONLY FIVE METHODS. EITHER IT'S ON YOU. EITHER, IF YOU'RE A FEMALE, IT'S IN THE PURSE. EITHER IT'S IN A BAG. OR IT'S IN A SHOPPING CART. OR IT'S IN A BOX. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SOUNDS LESS LIKE SHOPLIFTING AND MORE LIKE MY MOM SNEAKING FOOD INTO A MOVIE THEATER. NO, I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE MY PURSE, YEAH. YEAH, WHEEL MY PURSE INTO THE MOVIE THEATER. YOU WANT TWIZZLERS? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MOM, IS THAT A 2-LITER BOTTLE? DON'T GET ME THROWN OUT OF HERE. I'M GOING TO WATCH THIS TRAILER FOR "STAR WARS." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

Steve: I'M MAKING CARAMEL.
Jimmy: NO WAY.
Steve: GIVE ME THAT BLOWTORCH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GUYS, THIS SEEMS WEIRD TO ME. A BREWERY IN OREGON IS APPARENTLY COMING OUT WITH A A NEW SRIRACHA-FLAVORED BEER. [ SCATTERED CHEERS ] THAT'S RIGHT. A BEER THAT TASTES LIKE HOT SAUCE. THEY SAY IT'S THE PERFECT BEVERAGE FOR FINDING OUT IF YOU'RE AN ALCOHOLIC. THERE YOU GO. THERE'S ONLY ONE BEER LEFT, MAN. SORRY, THIS ONE'S GOT HOT SAUCE IN IT. BRING IT OVER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S NOT EVEN COLD. I DON'T CARE, JUST GIVE IT TO ME. AND FINALLY, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE'S EXCITED ABOUT THIS. THE FIRST TEASER FOR DISNEY'S "STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS" WAS RELEASED ON FRIDAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE TEASER IS 88 SECONDS LONG, BUT MOST "STAR WARS" FANS ONLY LASTED ABOUT FIVE SECONDS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'D SMOKE A CIGARETTE IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY ASTHMA. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, YOU GUYS. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

I LIKE THE -- I WANT TO GET INTO HOW YOU GOT INTO SOME OF THE CHARACTERS THAT WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE. BUT ALSO, AS A FAN OF JUST COMEDY -- IF YOU LOVE COMEDY, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK. I DON'T WANT IT TO END. I DON'T WANT -- I JUST WANT TO KEEP READING, BECAUSE EVERY CHAPTER'S LIKE -- THIS IS SO FUN AND INTERESTING AND GREAT.
THANK YOU. I KNOW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE CHARACTERS. I KNOW NATHAN THURM. AND I GO, ARE SOME OF THESE CHARACTERS -- THEY'RE ALL BASED ON PEOPLE YOU'VE MET THROUGH YOUR LIFE OR PEOPLE YOU KNOW. ED GRIMLEY WAS BASED ON A KID YOU KNEW IN HIGH SCHOOL.
THERE WAS A GUY IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO WANTED TO BE A A PHOTOGRAPHER, AND HIS VOICE WOULD ALWAYS GO UP LIKE THAT. AND I'D SAY, "SHAWN, SO DID YOU TAKE ANY PHOTOS THIS WEEKEND?" I TOOK A LOT OF SLIDES. BUT, UM, I DIDN'T, UM, DEVELOP IT BECAUSE I TOOK IT. SO THEREFORE, I KIND OF KNEW WHAT IT WAS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EVERYTHING ENDED IN A A QUESTION.
UM, EH --
Jimmy: ANYONE EVER BUST YOU AND GO, LIKE, "HEY, I KNOW YOU'RE DOING ME, MAN."
YEAH, AT "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." AT "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." BECAUSE I ALWAYS -- YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THINK THAT IF YOU CREATE A CHARACTER -- IF YOU START OFF WITH A REAL PERSON, IT KIND OF -- YOU'RE BASICALLY GROUNDED IN THREE DIMENSIONS. AND WHEN I WAS DOING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE," A CAST MEMBER -- THERE WAS THE MOST OFFENSIVE MAKEUP ARTIST. AND WE'LL CALL HER MARIAN SEIFERT. THAT WASN'T HER REAL NAME, BUT WE'LL JUST SAY THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] HER NAME WAS MARIAN SEIBERT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU SIT IN THE MAKEUP CHAIR AND YOU SAY, "GEE, MARIAN, I LOOK A LITTLE PALE, THOUGH." AND SHE'D SAY, "I KNOW THAT. YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT? I'M A MAKEUP ARTIST. I WOULD KNOW THAT." AND SHE CHAIN SMOKED. YOU COULD DO THAT IN THE ROOM IN '84, IN THE ROOM. I'D SAY, "OH, SORRY, MARIAN." SO, ABOUT A MONTH LATER, BILLY CRYSTAL, AND CHRISTOPHER GUEST, AND HARRY SHEARER, AND I WERE WRITING A PIECE, A SATIRE OF "60 MINUTES." AND I'M GOING TO PLAY THE DEFENSIVE LAWYER THAT ALWAYS DEFENDS THE BAD GUY. AND I GO, "I DON'T KNOW WHO PLAY." AND BILLY CRYSTAL SAYS, "WHY DON'T YOU PLAY MARIAN SEIBERT? YOU DO IT BEHIND HER BACK ALL THE TIME ANYWAY." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I SAID, "OH, I'LL GET CAUGHT." "AH, THEY NEVER FIND OUT," HE SAYS. YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A MAN, SHE'S A A WOMAN.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO, I'M NOW SITTING ON THE SET. AND OF COURSE, AND I'M -- AS NATHAN THURM, THIS LAWYER, BEING CROSS-EXAMINED BY HARRY SHEARER, PLAYING MIKE WALLACE. BUT I FORGET THAT MARIAN SEIBERT, OF COURSE, IS A A MAKEUP ARTIST. SO, SHE'LL BE THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO I'M MIKE WALLACE, AS HARRY IS SAYING, "SO, MR. THURM, DO YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR A LAWYER TO BEHAVE?" I SAY, "I KNOW THAT. YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT? I'M A LAWYER. I WOULD KNOW THAT." AND THE DIRECTOR SAYS, "CUT, HE'S SWEATING." AND SHE GOES, "I KNOW THAT. YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT? I'M A MAKEUP ARTIST." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND THEN, LIKE I SAID, AS YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMETHING'S A HIT, YOU DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. I ALWAYS TRY TO GET CAUGHT. I NEVER GOT CAUGHT. AND THEN THE LAST -- THE FINAL SHOW, BIG PARTY. AND ONE OF HER ASSISTANTS GOT DRUNK. AND SHE WENT, "MARIAN, HOW STUPID ARE YOU? YOU'RE NATHAN THURM! EVERYONE KNOWS IT BUT YOU!" AND SHE CONFRONTED ME. AND SHE SAID, "I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND." AND I SAID, "MARIAN, YOU KNOW, I AM YOUR FRIEND. I JUST -- YOU KNOW IMPERSONATION IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF COMPLIMENT." AND SHE SAID, "I KNOW THAT. YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I'M TELLING YOU, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS. YOU ALSO DO THE AUDIO BOOK, WHICH I HEAR IS AMAZING AS WELL. BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY GET TO HEAR MARTIN SHORT'S VOICE. I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE JAMES EARL JONES IS DOING AN AUDIO BOOK.
SHARON GLESS WASN'T AVAILABLE.
