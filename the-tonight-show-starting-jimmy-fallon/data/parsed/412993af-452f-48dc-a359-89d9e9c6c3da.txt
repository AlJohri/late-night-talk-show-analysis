Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- ANNE HATHAWAY. MARLON WAYANS. MUSICAL GUEST, YUSUF. AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW. AND NOW, HERE'S YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO THE SHOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. DID YOU GUYS CATCH THE BIG MATCHUP LAST NIGHT? [ CHEERS ] SO EXCITING. I WAS ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT. I WAS CHEERING, I WAS YELLING. AND THEN MY WIFE WALKED IN AND I SWITCHED OVER FROM "DANCING WITH THE STARS" TO THE BASKETBALL GAME. [ LAUGHTER ] GO TEAM! OF COURSE, I WANT TO SAY CONGRATS TO THE UCONN HUSKIES ON BEATING KENTUCKY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ THIS ISN'T GOOD. OOH, YEAH. DOZENS OF UCONN STUDENTS WERE ARRESTS AFTER THEY SMASHED WINDOWS AND BROKE STREETLIGHTS WHILE CELEBRATING THEIR TEAM'S WIN. YEAH, PEOPLE IN CONNECTICUT HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT ROWDY SINCE J. CREW HAD A SALE ON POCKET SQUARES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I REMEMBER THAT. I REMEMBER THAT WEEKEND.
Steve: IT WAS CRAZY!
Jimmy: DO NOT WANT TO BE THERE.
Steve: MORE PAISLEY.
Jimmy: IT WAS A VERY BIG NIGHT FOR UCONN PLAYER SHABAZZ NAPIER, WHO SCORED 22 POINTS IN HIS TEAM'S WIN. YEP, SHABAZZ NAPIER. HE'S THE FIRST NCAA CHAMPION TO BE NAMED BY JOHN TRAVOLTA. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S TRUE, THAT'S A FACT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THIS IS COOL. GEORGE W. BUSH AND BILL CLINTON SAT NEXT TO EACH OTHER AT THE BIG GAME. CLINTON CONGRATULATED UCONN ON ITS BIG WIN, WHILE BUSH GAVE KENTUCKY A MISSION ACCOMPLISHED BANNER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS IS WHAT MADE ME LAUGH. FOX NEWS TRIED TO COVER THE NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP, BUT THE ANCHOR KIND OF GOT THE STORY A A LITTLE MIXED UP. SEE IF YOU CAN SEE WHAT SHE DOES HERE.
WELL THE UCONN HUSKIES ARE THE 2014 NAACP NATIONAL CHAMPS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: DOINK!
Jimmy: AND THAT'S WHY THE NAACP EXISTS, EVERYONE. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST SO YOU KNOW. SO CLOSE. SO FAR AWAY. HERE'S KIND OF A CRAZY LOCAL STORY, AUTHORITIES HERE IN NEW YORK RECENTLY ARRESTED A A MAN AT JFK AIRPORT WITH SEVEN POUNDS OF COCAINE HIDDEN INSIDE GOAT MEAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS HE FORGOT THAT ONE KEY RULE OF SMUGGLING SOMETHING WEIRD, WHICH IS DON'T HIDE IT INSIDE SOMETHING EVEN WEIRDER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT? IT'S MY GOAT MEAT. DON'T LOOK THROUGH MY GOAT MEAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, COCAINE HIDDEN INSIDE GOAT MEAT, OR AS ROB FORD CALLS IT, AN H'ORS D'OEURVE. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T MIND IF I DON'T. SPEAKING OF ROB FORD, THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HE'S BEEN APPROACHED ABOUT GETTING HIS OWN REALITY SHOW. YEP, THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL EVERYBODY WHO'S GOING ON TO BE ON "INTERVENTION." SO ROB, PLEASE BE CAREFUL. IT'S A TRAP! CHECK THIS OUT, A NEW REPORT FOUND OUT THE GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE SUPER RICH IS GETTING BIGGER. REGULAR RICH PEOPLE ARE SO OUTRAGED BY THIS, THEY'VE ACTUALLY BEEN HOLDING PROTESTS. YEAH. TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROTEST SIGNS. FIRST WE HAVE, "WE'RE HERE, WE'RE NOT QUITE AS WEALTHY AS OTHER PEOPLE, GET USED TO IT." [ LAUGHTER ] THE NEXT SIGN SAYS, "YOU'RE TAKING FOOD OUT OF MY PUREBRED EGYPTIAN PHARAOH HOUND'S MOUTH." [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT WE HAVE, "WHAT DO WE WANT? MORE MONEY. WHEN DO WE WANT IT? IT DEPENDS. IF IT'S GIVING US STOCK OPTIONS, THEN WHENEVER, BUT IF IT'S CASH, I'D PREFER BEFORE APRIL 15th, SO I CAN AVOID CAPITAL GAINS TAXES." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, "YOU'LL TAKE MY BENTLEY WHEN YOU PRY IT OUT OF MY SOFT, FRESHLY MANICURED HANDS." [ APPLAUSE ] KIND OF HARD TO ROOT FOR THOSE PEOPLE. HERE'S SOME MORE CAR TROUBLE, HERE. MAZDA IS HAVING TO RECALL 42,000 CARS BECAUSE SPIDERS HAVE BEEN MAKING WEBS NEAR THE ENGINE VENT WHICH COULD CAUSE FIRES. YEAH. THEY SAID SO, IF YOU HAVE A A MAZDA, JUST HOP INTO THAT SPIDER-INFESTED FIREBALL AND DRIVE IT ON BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF IT THERE. NO PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] NO PROBLEM, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
Steve: EITHER DEATH BY FIRE OR SPIDERS.
Jimmy: YEAH. MAYBE GET SUPERPOWERS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS, THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE IS REFUSING TO DELIVER MAIL TO A NEIGHBORHOOD IN IOWA BECAUSE OF AN ANGRY CHIHUAHUA THAT HAS BEEN -- [ LAUGHTER ] ANGRY CHIHUAHUA THAT'S BEEN THREATENING A MAILMAN. IT GETS EVEN CRAZIER WHEN YOU HEAR THE DOG'S BEEN DOING IT OVER THE PHONE. IF SEE YOU IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD ONE MORE TIME -- [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN A A LOT OF CHANNELS ANNOUNCE THEIR NEW SHOWS. AND I SAW THAT THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL'S COMING OUT WITH A A REALITY SHOW WHER EIGHT CONTESTANTS SPEND OVER A MONTH TRYING TO MAKE IT IN THE WILDERNESS. YEAH. IT'S LIKE "SURVIVOR" MEETS -- WELL, "SURVIVOR." IT'S A SHOW THAT'S BEEN ON TV FOR 15 YEARS. I SAW THAT ANOTHER STATE IS SOFTENING ITS STANCE ON MARIJUANA. THAT'S RIGHT. YESTERDAY, MARYLAND LAWMAKERS VOTED TO DECRIMINALIZE POSSESSION OF TEN GRAMS OR LESS OF MARIJUANA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, US STONERS STILL FACE OTHER CHALLENGES, LIKE FIGURING OUT WHAT TEN GRAMS IS. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT LIKE THREE BAGS OR -- I DON'T HAVE A SCALE. WEIGH MY WEED. I THOUGHT THIS WAS INTERESTING. A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT PROCRASTINATING CAN ACTUALLY BE PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. I ASKED MY DAD ABOUT IT, HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, I MEANT TO TELL YOU THAT TEN YEARS AGO." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, I HEARD THAT NBC IS COMING OUT WITH A NEW SHOW SIMILAR TO "AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS." YEP, AN NBC SHOW WHERE EVERYONE STUMBLES AROUND AND FALLS, OR AS IT'S ALREADY KNOWN, THE FOURTH HOUR OF "THE TODAY SHOW." WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT.
