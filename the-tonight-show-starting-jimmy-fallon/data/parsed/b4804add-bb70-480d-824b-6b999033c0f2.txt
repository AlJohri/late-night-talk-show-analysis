SO, I FOLLOW EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE, AND I'M AT MOST OF THE GAMES WHERE YOU'RE BREAKING RECORDS OR DO DOING SOMETHING AWESOME. BUT I WAS JUST NERVOUS FOR YOU TONIGHT -- THAT NIGHT. I WAS JUST WATCHING YOU, AND I'M JUST ROOTING FOR YOU. SO, EIGHTH INNING, YOU'RE GONNA WIN. I GO, OKAY, THE YANKEES ARE GONNA WIN. DEREK'S LAST TIME UP AT-BAT. THAT'S ALL GOOD, I'M FINE. NO, BALTIMORE COMES BACK. THEY COME BACK AND TIE THE GAME. SO, IT'S A TIE GAME, I GO -- NOW WE'RE GOING INTO THE NINTH INNING. I GO, AND I'M LOOKING AT THE ORDER AND I GO, "DEREK'S THIRD, HE'S GONNA GET UP AGAIN." I GO, "THIS IS JUST AWFUL."
YOU SHOULD HAVE -- YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING TO MYSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE, YOU'RE LIKE, YOU GOT TO BE --
I HONESTLY WAS -- I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA LOSE IT ON THE FIELD. YOU KNOW? I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA START CRYING FROM BEFORE THE GAME EVEN STARTED AND THE EIGHTH INNING, THE WAY IT WAS LOOKING, THIS WAS GONNA BE THE END. SO -- I WAS GETTING CHOKED UP AND I WAS HOPING THAT JOE WOULD GET ME OUT OF THERE BEFORE I SCREWED SOMETHING UP. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, THEY TIED THE GAME AND I GOT ONE MORE AT-BAT.
Jimmy: BUT THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. SO, YOU'RE THERE, THERE'S RUNNER ON FIRST. OH, NO. SO, YOU'RE THERE, THERE'S RUNNER ON FIRST. OH, NO. AT FIRST AND THEN GARDNER GETS OUT.

Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
AND YOU SEE HIM JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND IT'S KIND OF -- SEE, I DON'T WANT TO TALK BAD ABOUT YOU, BUT IT'S KIND OF AWKWARD BECAUSE -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHY. BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIS HANDS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE THING IS YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR HANDS.

Jimmy: NO MATTER WHAT?
NO MATTER WHAT. SO, PSYCHED.
Jimmy: THAT GUY WAS BOOKING IT, MAN.
YEAH. BUT I MEAN, EVERY -- WHAT YOU GUYS DIDN'T SEE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SHOW IT WHEN YOU WATCH THE GAME, BUT DURING EVERY INNING, THEY WOULD HAVE A VIDEO HIGHLIGHT ON THE JUMBOTRON OF, LIKE, EVERYONE IN THE WORLD SAYING GOOD-BYE TO YOU.
YEAH, IT'S KIND OF A -- YOU KNOW, I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE, IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE AT YOUR OWN FUNERAL. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING HAS -- EVERYONE HAD GREAT THINGS TO SAY WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE, BUT IT'S VERY, VERY ODD TO BE OUT THERE AND HEARING ABOUT YOURSELF LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M STILL HERE, BUT IT'S THE END IT'S LIKE --

Jimmy: BUT I HEARD YOU WENT INTO THE YANKEE TUNNEL COUPLE TIMES, LIKE -- I JUST GOT TO GET IT OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM, BECAUSE --
I HAD TO KEEP IT TOGETHER AND BEFORE I WENT UP FOR MY LAST AT BAT, I KNELT DOWN AND I SAID, "GOD, IF YOU HAVE ANYMORE MAGICAL MOMENTS LEFT IN HAD YOU, CAN IT PLEASE BE RIGHT NOW?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, WELL YOU GOT IT MAN, YOU GOT THE MAGIC MOMENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE LIKE YOU. IT HAPPENS A LOT TO YOU. YOU GET ALL THE MAGICAL MOMENTS.

MOST POSTSEASON SEASON HITS, 200, YOU HOLD THE RECORD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JUST INSANITY, GO DOWN THE LIST, YOU DID ALL THIS.
IT MEANS WE ARE GETTING OLD, JIMMY. THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS. WE'RE GETTING OLD.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT IT MEANS. BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO SINCE YOU WERE A KID.
I WAS -- THIS IS THE ONLY DREAM I EVER HAD. YOU KNOW, MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A A HUGE YANKEE FAN AND I HAD 13 BROTHERS AND SISTERS, MY MOM HAS 13 BROTHERS AND SISTERS, SO I USED TO SPEND EVERY SUMMER IN JERSEY AND SHE WOULD SIT UP AND SHE'D WATCH YANKEE GAMES, AND THAT IS THE ONLY THING I EVER WANTED TO DO AND I'VE BEEN BLESS AND FORTUNATE TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY.
Jimmy: THAT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE. AND WHAT A -- I THINK OUT OF ALL THE CITIES, NEW YORK CITY IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST CITIES, ESPECIALLY PRESS-WISE AND MEDIA-WISE.
WELL, I MEAN, IT'S TOUGH. IT'S ALL I'VE KNOWN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, LOOK, THE MEDIA HAS BEEN FAIR WITH ME, THEY ARE -- YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE CRITICIZED BUT THE EXPECTATION LEVEL IS HIGH IT'S HIGH FOR THE FANS, BUT I'VE HAD NO COMPLAINTS WITH THE MEDIA.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU HAVE ALWAYS HANDLED YOURSELF PERFECT, AND I GO, AH, THAT'S SO GREAT, EVERYONE SHOULD DO THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID IT, DODGE THE THING OR JUST TALK -- YOU HAVE GREAT PARENTS. THEY RAISED YOU VERY WELL. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE THEY'D BE LIKE, "WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT? THAT WAS A SCREW UP." YOU GO, "WELL, LOOK, WE ALL PLAYED TOGETHER. WE WERE ALL TRYING TO BE --" AND I'M LIKE, SUCH A GREAT ANSWER, MAN. THAT'S SO GOOD. 'CAUSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE, YEAH, I KNOW, ISN'T HE AWFUL? I PLAYED GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING HAD, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE MOST LIKELY, THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO RETIRE THE NUMBER 2, THAT'S YOUR NUMBER. AND I WAS THINKING, IT'S LAST SINGLE DIGIT IN YANKEE HISTORY.
IT IS. YOU KNOW, YANKEES HAVE A A STORIED FRANCHISE. THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT PLAYERS.
Jimmy: 1'S BILLY MARTIN. BABE RUTH, NUMBER 3; LOU GEHRIG, NUMBER 4. JOE DiMAGGIO, 5. I MEAN, YOU'RE ON THIS LIST.

I KNOW.
Jimmy: I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU. BUT, I MEAN, HOW FUN AND EXCITING, I MEAN, BUT I -- JUST TRYING TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, HOW MANY GAMES ARE IN A SEASON?
162.
Jimmy: 162 GAMES. AND EVERY GAME, BASICALLY, IS PEOPLE SAYING GOOD-BYE TO YOU, KIND OF.
YEAH, IT WAS. YOU KNOW, I ANNOUNCED THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE MY LAST YEAR BEFORE THE SEASON STARTED, BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I HAD NO CHOICE. AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO PLAY IF I DIDN'T ANNOUNCE THAT. AND IT'S KIND OF HARD TO KEEP A A SECRET IN NEW YORK. SO --
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
I DECIDED TO ANNOUNCE IT EVERYTHING THAT CAME ALONG WITH IT, I DIDN'T EXPECT IT. I DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO CHEER FOR ME OR SAY NICE THINGS, BUT IT FELT GOOD. I WOULD BE LYING TO YOU IF I SAID IT DIDN'T.
Jimmy: AH, IT'S AMAZING. AND NOW YOU HAVE MORE TIME TO DO OTHER THINGS, ONE BEING YOUR CHARITY, TURN2FOUNDATION.ORG. I HAVE BEEN CHARITY GOLFING WITH YOU ONE TIME, THAT WAS REALLY FUN. DON'T TELL ANY STORIES.
I TOLD STORIES ABOUT JIMMY LAST TIME.
Jimmy: I WOKE UP AND MADE THE FLIGHT. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
HE GOT HOME.
Jimmy: I GOT HOME. I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M ALL SAFE.
WITH A LITTLE ASSISTANCE FROM HIS MOM.
Jimmy: MOM HAD TO CALL AND WAKE ME UP AT THE HOTEL. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] DOESN'T MATTER. UM, LOOK -- NOW YOU HAVE THIS -- YOU HAVE THIS NEW WEBSITE, THE PLAYERS' TRIBUNE.
MM-HMM.
Jimmy: THIS IS A GREAT IDEA. I THINK IT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA. THIS IS BASICALLY, CUTS OUT THE MIDDLEMAN AND LET ALSO THE ATHLETES BASICALLY JUST TELL THEIR OWN STORIES, WRITE THEIR OWN STORIES AND GIVE THEIR OWN INTERVIEWS YOU WILL STRAIGHT UP RIGHT TO THE --
YEAH. WELL, IT'S A DIGITAL PLATFORM THAT WE HAVE FOR THE ATHLETES AND WE WANT THE ATHLETES TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES AND REALLY FROM A FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE AND IT'S REALLY NOT OUT THERE AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE SPORTS WRITERS. I MEAN, THE SPORTS WRITERS ARE WHAT MAKES SPORTS GREAT AND FUN TO WATCH AND PEOPLE'S DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. BUT THIS JUST ANOTHER AVENUE FOR THE ATHLETES TO USE, TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND YOU KNOW, IN THIS DAY AND AGE, I THINK ATHLETES, THEY REALLY LIKE TO SHARE WITH THE PEOPLE EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM. I, PERSONALLY, HAVE NOT DONE THAT. SO, I PERSONALLY, WILL NOT DO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'VE BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT THAT. EXACTLY.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME. THIS IS ABOUT AN AVENUE FOR THE PLAYERS. SO --
Jimmy: YEAH, AND YOU'VE GOT A BUNCH OF GREAT PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE DOING IT. RUSSELL WILSON JUST DID A GREAT THING.
YEAH, HE A GREAT PIECE TODAY. SO YOU GUYS CHECK THAT OUT, YOU KNOW, ABOUT BULLYING AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO, THAT'S -- YOU KNOW, HE DECIDED TO TOUCH THAT TOPIC.
Jimmy: REALLY OPENED UP, AND IT'S REALLY HONEST.
ATHLETES HAVE A LOT OF OPINIONS ON THINGS I THINK SOMETIMES JUST TALKING WITH ATHLETES FROM DIFFERENT SPORTS, I THINK SOMETIMES THEY GET A A LITTLE HESITANT TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO BE PORTRAYED AND YOU ALWAYS HEAR PEOPLE SAY, WELL, THIS WAS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT, BUT NOW IT GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY AND WE ARE PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT
Jimmy: CHECK OUT THEPLAYERSTRIBUNE.COM. MORE WITH DEREK JETER AFTER THE BREAK, YOU GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STICK AROUND. WE'VE MORE STUFF TO TALK ABOUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: YEAH. NOW YOU --
I'M SCARED OF WHAT YOU MIGHT PUT UP THERE NEXT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, I'M SORRY. I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. HERE THIS IS YOU ON "DANCING WITH THE STARS." THAT WAS GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW LOOK AT THIS CRAZY.
YEAH, THIS IS DURING THE FILMING OF THE GATORADE SPOT THAT I DID IN NEW YORK.
Jimmy: OH, MAN. BEAUTIFUL SPOT.
GOT A CHANCE TO MINGLE WITH SOME FANS AND BASICALLY GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THANK YOU TO YANKEE FANS AND BASEBALL FANS.
Jimmy: PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THIS STUFF AND THEY WANT TO SEE THE SIDE OF YOU, TOO, THAT A A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS AT THAT GAME, YOU DID SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER DOING IT, BUT YOU WALKED OUT TO YOUR POSITION AFTER THE GAME AND JUST KNEELED DOWN AND, LIKE, PUT YOUR HEAD IN YOUR HAND, LIKE, "OH, HE IS GONNA LOSE IT." EVERYONE WAS CRYING, I WAS LIKE, I WAS JUST DOING THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE -- I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO YOU WENT DOWN THERE, HAD A LITTLE MOMENT.
YEAH, I HAD A MOMENT. I MEAN, I JUST THANK GOD FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT FOR SO LONG, SO IT WAS A A TIME OF REFLECTION FOR ME AND I APPRECIATE IT.
Jimmy: YEAH THAT WAS A WILD THING. NOTHIS IS ANOTHER BOOK YOU HAVE OUT. THIS IS ACTUALLY A -- IT'S CALLED "THE CONTRACT," IT'S ALREADY NUMBER TWO ON THE "NEW YORK TIMES" BEST SELLERS LIST," THIS IS MORE OF A STORY LIKE A -- FOR YOUNG ADULTS.
YES, IT'S MIDDLE AGE SCHOOL KIDS, BOOK FOR THEM, BASED LOOSELY ON MY EXPERIENCES GROWING UP. MY PARENTS USED TO MAKE ME SIGN A CONTRACT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS BASED ON, WHETHER IT WAS DOING WELL IN SCHOOL OR CURFEWS, WHICH I ALWAYS TRIED TO NEGOTIATE BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S A COOL THING.
WE LITERALLY HAD TO SIGN CONTRACTS, ME AND MY SISTER AS WELL.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT TURNED OUT FOR YOU, IT WORKED BUT I MEAN --
IT WORKED. BUT AT THE TIME, I WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH EXACTLY BUT -- A A PICTURE OF THE CONTRACT THING WAS LIKE YOU KNOW, IF YOU GET A A 3.7 GPA, YOU GET EXTRA THINGS. IF YOU GET A 4.0, THAT'S AWESOME, EVEN BETTER, BUT, LIKE, IN LIKE -- DON'T ARGUE, DON'T ARGUE.
AND I HAD TO SIGN IT I ACTUALLY SIGNED THE CONTRACT AND IF I DIDN'T DO EVERYTHING THAT WAS ON IT I COULDN'T PLAY SPORTS. SO IT TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT SETTING GOALS AND YOU KNOW -- FIRST CONTRACT I SIGNED.
Jimmy: THAT'S PRETTY COOL, YES IT'S CALLED "THE CONTRACT," AND HONESTLY, I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU AND TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD I SAID HI AND I LOVE THEM AND YOUR SISTER BACK THERE, BUT GOSH, MAN WHAT A GREAT HUMAN YOU ARE. YOU ARE JUST AWESOME. WERE JUST SO EXCITED, CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, BUDDY. I KNOW YOU JUST FLEW IN FROM LONDON.

Jimmy: YOU WERE DOING PRESS ON THE MOVIE OVER THERE?
YEAH, I WAS WORKING OVER THERE, YEAH, DOING PRESS FOR THE MOVIE, INTERVIEWS, THINGS LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: HOW IS THAT? WERE YOU WITH FOREIGN REPORTERS?
YEAH, IT'S GREAT. IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT WHAT DO. WE GET TO TRAVEL AND PROMOTE THE MOVIE AND EVERYTHING. BUT, GOING TO THE U.K. -- JUST SO MANY DIFFERENT ACCENTS AND PERSONALITIES.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
I WAS SPEAKING TO THIS LOVELY SCOTTISH WOMAN OVER THE PHONE ON THIS RADIO INTERVIEW. AND SHE WAS TALKING TO ME ABOUT THE MOVIE, OBVIOUSLY, THE MOVIE IS A VERY ROMANTIC MOVIE, SO SHE SAYS -- [ SCOTTISH ACCENT ] "SO, JAMES, YOU ARE QUITE THE HOPELESS ROMANTIC IN THIS FILM. "FELLUM." THEY SAY "FELLUM." LIKE TRYING TO FOLLOW AND SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. [ SCOTTISH ACCENT ] "NOW, IN YOUR REAL LIFE, ARE YOU -- TELL ME, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT FEET?" [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE MY THOUGHTS ABOUT FEET? [ SCOTTISH ACCENT ] "OH, NO, NO, NO FEET, LIKE DESTINY. LIKE FATE." OH, FATE. FATE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS GOT WEIRD REAL QUICK.
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. I BELIEVE IN FEET. [ LAUGHTER ] I BELIEVE IN FEET.
Jimmy: OBSOLUTELY.
GIVE HER MY -- IT GOT WEIRD.
Jimmy: YOU WERE TELLING ME A A GREAT STORY BACKSTAGE ABOUT THE FIRST TIME YOU MOVED TO LOS ANGELES AND THE FIRST CELEBRITY SIGHTING. YOU NEVER FORGET YOUR FIRST CELEBRITY SIGHTING.
I GREW UP IN OKLAHOMA. WHEN I MOVED TO L.A., IT WAS ALL ABOUT JUST FINDING A A CELEBRITY ON THE STREETS OR WHATEVER. AND THERE'S THIS -- THIS'S THIS HORSE RIDE YOU CAN TAKE OVER THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS BY THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN. I FORGET THE NAME OF THE RANCH, BUT YOU KNOW, THEY TAKE THESE GREAT GROUP HORSES -- GROUP OF PEOPLE OVER INTO THE VALLEY AND YOU GO TO THE MEXICAN RESTAURANT AND EVERYONE DRINKS SHOTS OF TEQUILA, YOU GET DRUNK AND THEN YOU RIDE HORSES. A GREAT IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.
IT'S A LOW-RISK -- SO, I WILL NEVER FORGET, I SAW FABIO WAS ON -- [ LAUGHTER ] WAS ON THIS HORSE RIDE OVER THE HILLS.
Jimmy: WAS HE ON A HORSE?
ON A HORSE.
Jimmy: COME ON! NO WAY, MAN! THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.
IT WAS SO CLICHE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW MANY TEQUILAS DID YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU THINK YOU SAW FABIO? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY AT FIRST AND THEN WE WENT OVER AND I HAD SOME TEQUILA.
Jimmy: HE SAID, "I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT PATRON." [ LAUGHTER ]
IT WAS JUST GREAT, I'M SEEING FABIO AND HE'S ON A A HORSE. AND HE WAS ON, LIKE, ON THIS LITTLE, DUMPY HORSE. IT WAS NOT -- YOU WOULD THINK WOULD BRING HIS OWN HORSE.
Jimmy: FABIO DOESN'T HAVE A A FLEET OF HORSES. HE JUST TAKES WHATEVER HE GETS, MAN.
AND HE WAS ON A FIRST DATE -- HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS ON A A DATE, HE WASN'T VERY HAPPY TO BE THERE. ANYWAY, IT WAS --
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH, I LOVE THAT. THAT'S SO GOOD, MAN. LIKE EVERY -- YOU HAVE BEEN IN A WHOLE MESS OF DIFFERENT MOVIES, ACTION, YOU'VE BEEN IN COMEDIES, ROMANTIC, DRAMA PIECES. DO YOU -- DO YOU HAVE DIFFERENT FANS FOR EACH GENRE OF FILM?
YEAH. YEAH. YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMEONE STOPS YOU ON THE STREET, WHICH, YOU KNOW, IT NEVER HAPPENS THAT OFTEN, BUT WHEN IT DOES, SOMEONE -- IT'S ALWAYS -- YOU'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY SAW YOU IN, LIKE, WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO RECOGNIZE YOU. BECAUSE, SOMETIMES IT'S, YOU KNOW "WHAT DO YOU PLAY IN?" YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU DO?
YEAH, TELL ME WHAT YOU DO. BUT, YEAH, YOU ALWAYS TRY TO GUESS WHAT THEY KNOW AND THERE'S A GUY ON THE STREET THE OTHER DAY, WHO WAS JUST KIND OF REALLY MACHO SOUTHERN DUDE, WEARING LIKE AN MMA T-SHIRT. AND HE WAS LIKE, "DUDE, CAN I GET A PICTURE WITH YOU, YOU'RE IN MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME." I'M SAID, "YEAH, MAN, WHATEVER. YEAH, SURE."
Jimmy: X-MEN?
SO YOU'RE AN "X-MEN" FAN? HE GOES, "NAH, 'NOTEBOOK' DUDE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: REALLY?
LIKE REALLY?
Jimmy: "NOTEBOOK"?
"YEAH, MAN, I CRIED MY ASS OFF." [ LAUGHTER ] "MY FAVORITE MOVIE." GOOD FOR YOU, MAN.
Jimmy: OKAY. GOOD FOR YOU, MAN.
BOLD. UNAPOLOGETICALLY ROMANTIC.
Jimmy: HE BELIEVES IN FEET. [ LAUGHTER ] HE BELIEVES IN FEET. YOU GOT TO BELIEVE IN FEET.
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE IN FEET. BELIEVE IN IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, "THE BEST OFME," THIS IS ANOTHER -- BASED ON A NICHOLAS SPARKS BOOK AGAIN?
YEAH. YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S ANOTHER ROMANTIC FILM.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE GOOD IN THOSE.
THANK YOU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHY THEY CAST YOU.
I FEEL LIKE EVERY DECADE, I TRY TO JUST --
Jimmy: DO A DIFFERENT ONE. WHAT IS THIS ONE ABOUT? CAN YOU SUM IT UP?
THIS IS ABOUT -- IT IS SIMILAR TO "THE NOTEBOOK" IN THAT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT STORYLINES OR ACTUALLY TWO DIFFERENT TIMELINES I GUESS. YOU HAVE A YOUNG COUPLE WHO MEET EACH OTHER WHEN THEY ARE VERY YOUNG AND FALL MADLY IN LOVE AND THEN HE GETS IN A BIT OF TROUBLE AND THEN THEY SPLIT UP ABOUT 20 YEARS. LIFE KIND OF BRINGS THEM BACK TOGETHER AND THEY GET TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE TOGETHER OR NOT.
Jimmy: COME ON. THAT'S FANTASTIC. I KNOW THIS IS ONE WE ALL WANT -- [ APPLAUSE ]
I REALLY SHOULD BE HERE ON VALENTINE'S DAY.
Jimmy: YOU REALLY SHOULD BE YEAH. HERE'S A CLIP. HERE'S JAMES MARSDEN IN "THE BEST OF ME." TAKE A LOOK.
WHAT? WHY YOU LAUGHING?
I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS I JUST -- I MISSED THIS. I MISS YOU GETTING ALL MAD AT ME.
I'M NOT MAD.
A LITTLE PUSHY.
I'M NOT PUSHY.
YOU JUST CARE SO MUCH, AMANDA. YOU JUST CAN'T HELP YOURSELF.
I SHOULD GO.
WHY?
THIS IS DANGEROUS. WE HAVE HAD WINE AND SOMEHOW, YOU HAVE GOTTEN BETTER LOOKING, WHICH IS SO ANNOYING. WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE GOTTEN BALD OR FAT OR SOMETHING? GEEZ. [ APPLAUSE ]
