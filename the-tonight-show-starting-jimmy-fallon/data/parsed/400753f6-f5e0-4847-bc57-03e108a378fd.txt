LET'S GET RIGHT TO THE NEWS. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM VERMONT, BERNIE SANDERS, WILL ANNOUNCE TOMORROW THAT HE IS OFFICIALLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [ CHEERS ] YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S TRUE. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO BERNIE SANDERS IS, HERE'S A A PICTURE OF HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] APPARENTLY, HIS RUNNING MATE IS MARTY McFLY. [ LAUGHTER ] GREAT SCOTT, MARTY! WE NEED 1.1 GIGABUCKS FOR OUR SUPERPAC. [ CHEERS ] THAT'S RIGHT, VERMONT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE TOMORROW THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, MAKING HIM HILLARY CLINTON'S ONLY DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER SO FAR. OR AS HILLARY PUT IT, "OOH, APPETIZERS!" [ LAUGHTER ] HUNGRY. OF COURSE, MOST PEOPLE AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH BERNIE SANDERS. SO, TO HELP YOU GET TO KNOW HIM A LITTLE BIT, HERE'S A CLIP FROM ONE OF HIS RECENT SPEECHES. CHECK IT OUT.
THIS COUNTRY NOW IS IN A A MAJOR RACE TO THE BOTTOM.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT SURE IF YOU NOTICED, BUT HE'S KIND OF KNOWN FOR USING HIS HANDS A LOT WHEN HE SPEAKS. IN FACT, TAKE A LOOK AT ANOTHER CLIP.

[ LAUGHTER ] "I'M BUSY." MANY BELIEVE THAT IF HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN FALLS APART, JOE BIDEN WILL BE THE GO-TO CANDIDATE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. INCIDENTALLY, THAT'S ALSO THE SLOGAN HILLARY'S USING TO RAISE MONEY. [ LAUGHTER ] "IF MY CAMPAIGN FALLS APART, JOE BIDEN WILL BE THE GO-TO CANDIDATE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] VERY EFFECTIVE.
