Questlove: 257, BURUNDI.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HEY, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," YOU GUYS. YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S HAPPENING. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I SAW THAT HILLARY CLINTON MADE HER FIRST CAMPAIGN STOP IN LAS VEGAS YESTERDAY, WHERE SHE DISCUSSED IMMIGRATION, SAID SHE WANTS CITIZENSHIP FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. BUT AFTER SEEING AMERICANS CELEBRATE CINCO DE MAYO YESTERDAY, IMMIGRANTS WERE LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAD A -- WE'RE GONNA GO BACK. WE'RE GONNA GO BACK NOW. WE HAD ENOUGH. WE DON'T LIKE IT." YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT, HILLARY MADE HER FIRST CAMPAIGN STOP IN LAS VEGAS. OFFICIALS SAID "CLINTON'S VISIT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE ECONOMY IN VEGAS." THEN THEY SAID, "OH, WAIT. HILLARY CLINTON? [ LAUGHTER ] OH, NEVER MIND. NEVER MIND. GIRLS, TAKE THE NIGHT OFF." [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, I READ THAT CANDIDATES IN THE 2 2016 ELECTION ARE COMPETING IN ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE FIELDS EITHER PARTY HAS EVER SEEN. YEAH, WE HAVE TWO WOMEN, TWO LATINOS AND AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN. THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS THE "COLLEGE BROCHURE" OF ELECTIONS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "THIS SCHOOL IS FOR EVERYONE." OF COURSE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE ANNOUNCED HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT YESTERDAY, AND I THINK HE MIGHT ALREADY BE STRUGGLING TO COME UP WITH REASONS WHY HE SHOULD BE PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] CHECK IT OUT.
I GOT MY FIRST BB GUN AT AGE 5. IT WAS A DAISY MODEL 25. I'VE STILL GOT IT. IT'S IN MINT CONDITION. I LEARNED THE BASIC RULES OF GUN SAFETY, AND I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT USING A FIREARM TO MURDER SOMEONE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THOUGH HE HAS SHOT HIMSELF IN THE FOOT NUMEROUS TIMES, INCLUDING THAT SPEECH. [ LAUGHTER ] "GOT MY FIRST BB GUN AT AGE 5. MY LITTLE BROTHER GOT HIS FIRST GLASS EYE AT AGE 4. ISN'T THAT NICE?" [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW LOW OUR EXPECTATIONS HAVE GOTTEN FOR POLITICIANS, NOW THEY'RE BRAGGING ABOUT NOT BEING MURDERERS. THAT'S A GOOD THING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING A A GUY. I COULD STRANGLE HIM.
Steve: NEVER ACTED ON IT.
Jimmy: AND DID YOU SEE THIS? JIM BOB AND MICHELLE DUGGAR FROM THE SHOW "19 KIDS AND COUNTING," THEY ARE SUPPORTING MIKE HUCKABEE FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE THEY SAID HE HAS COMMON SENSE. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO KNOWS ABOUT COMMON SENSE, IT'S THE FAMILY WITH 19 KIDS. YESTERDAY, FLOYD MAYWEATHER SAID THAT HE WOULD GIVE MANNY PACQUIAO A REMATCH NEXT YEAR. IN FACT, THEY'VE ALREADY COME UP WITH AN EXCITING TAGLINE -- "MAYWEATHER VERSUS PACQUIAO 2: MAYBE THEY'LL KISS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Steve: BOXING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, THIS IS COOL. YOUTUBE HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO DEVELOP SEVERAL FULL LENGTH FILMS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS THAT WILL FEATURE SOME OF ITS MOST FAMOUS STARS. WE ACTUALLY GOT A PREVIEW OF IT. HERE, CHECK THIS OUT. ♪♪
THIS SUMMER, YOUTUBE HITS THE BIG SCREEN WITH YOUR FAVORITE STARS. THE FINE BROS, JOEY GRACEFFA, SMOSH. CAT WITH ITS HEAD STUCK IN A A TISSUE BOX. CAT WITH ITS HEAD STUCK IN A A CHEETOS BAG.

Jimmy: THAT'S GOING TO BE FUN. THAT'S GOING TO BE GOOD.
Steve: YOUTUBE!
Jimmy: YEAH. AND FINALLY, AS WE SAID EARLIER, YESTERDAY WAS CINCO DE MAYO, AND PEOPLE WERE OUT CELEBRATING ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY. WE WANTED TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN WITH THEM, SO WE SENT OUR WRITER ARTHUR OUT THERE TO ASK PEOPLE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE HISTORY OF CINCO DE MAYO. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW IS THAT HE NEVER ACTUALLY GETS TO THE QUESTION. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IN A A SEGMENT WE CALL, "THE BIG QUESTION." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ WHAT'S THE BIG QUESTION ♪
SO AS WE ALL KNOW, CINCO DE MAYO, WHICH, OF COURSE IS SPANISH FOR FIFTH OF MAY, IS A A MEXICAN NATIONAL HOLIDAY IN HONOR OF THE MILITARY VICTORY IN THE BATTLE OF PUEBLA IN 1862 OVER THE FRENCH FORCES OF NAPOLEON. BUT THE BATTLE ACTUALLY STARTED A YEAR EARLIER WHEN MEXICO DECLARED A TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON THE REPAYMENT OF FOREIGN DEBTS AND WAS THEN INVADED BY ENGLISH, SPANISH, AND FRENCH TROOPS. AND THEN, AFTER THE ENGLISH AND SPANISH TROOPS LEFT, THE FRENCH STAYED BEHIND AND ATTEMPTED TO ESTABLISH A MONARCHY UNDER MAXIMILIAN OF AUSTRIA WHICH, AS WE NOW KNOW WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I'M GETTING WAY AHEAD OF MYSELF. MY QUESTION IS, KNOWING THAT THE HOLIDAY EVENTUALLY BECAME A A SYMBOL OF MEXICAN RESISTANCE AGAINST THE INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN NOMINATION, AND THAT THE CITY ITSELF IS NOW HOME TO A MUSEUM AND A PARK DEVOTED TO THE BATTLE WHICH ATTRACTS TOURISTS, FAMILIES, SCHOOL CHILDREN, PETS, PESTS, GUESTS, VESTS. VETS OF COURSE, FAMILIES OF PETS, FAMILIES OF PESTS, FAMILIES OF GUESTS, FAMILIES OF VETS. SO WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS DO YOU THEN BELIEVE AS MANY DO, THAT IT'S THESE VERY PEOPLE, THESE GROUPS, THESE CIRCLES, THESE UNIONS, THESE --
THIS MANY PEOPLE?
YEAH, UH-HUH.
OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
THESE COTERIES AS IT WERE, AND AS IT WILL BE. WHO HAVE BEEN IMMERSED IN THE FILMS OF CINEMATIC ARTISTS SUCH AS EMILIO FERNANDEZ, ATHLETES LIKE SALVADOR SANCHEZ, VOCAL MUSICAL ARTISTS SUCH AS LUIS MIGUEL, JULIETA VENEGAS, AND PAULINA --
GOMEZ.
RUBIO. [ LAUGHTER ] DOES IT NOT ALSO MEAN THAT THAT MEAN, AS FORMER MEXICAN PRESIDENT BENITO JUAREZ ONCE SAID -- [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ LAUGHTER ] SO I GUESS, ALL THAT BEING SAID, MY QUESTION WOULD HAVE TO BE WHAT'S UP? [ LAUGHTER ]
THIS GIVES ME A REASON TO DRINK.
AWESOME. THANKS, SO MUCH. BACK TO YOU, JIMMY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
