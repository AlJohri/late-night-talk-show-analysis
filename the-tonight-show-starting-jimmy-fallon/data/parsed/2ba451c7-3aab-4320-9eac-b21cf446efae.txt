Questlove: 347, NEW YORK!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HEY! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT! LOOKING GREAT. HOT CROWD TONIGHT. CRAZY GOOD CROWD TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. WELCOME. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. HERE'S WHAT'S EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, IT'S THIS WHOLE MESS WITH THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. DID YOU HEAR THAT YESTERDAY KEVIN McCARTHY, WHO WAS CONSIDERED THE FAVORITE TO BE THE NEW SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, HE DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T FEEL HE HAD ENOUGH SUPPORT TO WIN. YEAH. THEN 12 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SAID, "THAT NEVER STOPPED US." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. EVERYONE WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY McCARTHY'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE'S DROPPING OUT. BUT NO ONE WAS MORE SURPRISED THAN SOMEONE FROM HIS DISTRICT BACK HOME. WATCH THIS.
ONE WOMAN, WHO WORKS AT LUIGI'S, A PLACE THAT McCARTHY FREQUENTLY VISITS, HADN'T HEARD THE NEWS.
HE DID? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PEOPLE WERE LIKE, "CAN WE NOMINATE HER FOR SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE?" YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO DO WHAAAA? WITH OUR HUH? HUH? HE DID? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SHE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE CAUGHT OFF GUARD. McCARTHY'S DECISION LEFT THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS IN COMPLETE DISARRAY. THEY'RE WITHOUT A LEADER AND NOT SURE WHERE TO TURN. YOU COULD TELL THINGS WERE CHAOTIC JUST FROM WATCHING C-SPAN. CHECK THIS OUT.
COMING UP ON C-SPAN AT 8:00, PAUL RYAN TEARS OFF HIS SHIRT AND SCREAMS, "NO RULES. I'M GONNA LIVE FOREVER." AT 8:01, BILLY LONG DECLARES A A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN HIS DOCKERS. AT 8:03, RANDY NOGABOWER DECLARES HIMSELF LEADER OF NOGABOWERIA. AT 8:04, FRED UPTON SAYS, "SCREW THIS. I'M GOING BACK TO MY OLD JOB OF BEING AN AIRLINE PILOT IN 1970." AT 8:05, ANN WAGNER PUTS BUTTER KNIVES BETWEEN HER FINGERS AND KEEPS CALLING HERSELF "LADY WOLVERINE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AT 8:06, GREG WALDEN BRINGS OUT SOME COCAINE, REALIZES HE MISREAD THE ROOM, AND PUTS IT AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, AT 8:07, JOHN BOEHNER WALKS IN AND SAYS, "SORRY, I FORGOT MY KEYS. WHOA, GUYS, I WAS ONLY GONE FOR A FEW MINUTES." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I'M SURE THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
Steve: HE MISREAD THE ROOM.
Jimmy: HE MISREAD THE ROOM. [ LAUGHTER ] I MISREAD THE ROOM, MY BAD.
Steve: HE PUT IT AWAY.
Jimmy: THE OTHER BIG POLITICAL STORY IS THAT NEXT WEEK, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES HILLARY CLINTON, BERNIE SANDERS, MARTIN O'MALLEY, LINCOLN CHAFEE AND JIM WEBB WILL HAVE THEIR FIRST DEBATE IN LAS VEGAS. YEAH. A VERY CALCULATING WOMAN, A A WEIRD OLD GUY, AND THREE DUDES YOU'LL NEVER SEE AGAIN. SO, BASICALLY, EVERY POKER TABLE IN VEGAS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? THEY SHOULD BE USED TO IT. AND BERNIE SANDERS ACTUALLY SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO ANY PRACTICE DEBATES BEFORE THE FIRST REAL DEMOCRATIC DEBATE NEXT WEEK. HIS AIDES TOLD HIM THAT WITHOUT PREPARATION, HE WONT BE ABLE TO OFFER QUICK REBUTTALS, TO WHICH SANDERS SAYS, "OH, YEAH. WELL -- [ LAUGHTER ] SO, SO IS YOUR MOM. SO, WHATEVER." [ APPLAUSE ] AND I SAW THAT HILLARY CLINTON SENT HER OWN BOOK, "HARD CHOICES", TO EACH REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AS A GAG GIFT. IN FACT, SHE SENT HER BOOK TO ALL THE CANDIDATES. AND AFTER THEY READ IT, THEY EACH OFFERED THEIR OWB BLURBS THAT WERE PUBLISHED ON THE BACK OF THE BOOK'S NEWEST EDITION.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH. CHECK THESE OUT. FOR INSTANCE, JEB BUSH WROTE, "I DON'T WANT TO READ THIS BOOK, BUT MY DAD READ I, THEN MY BROTHER READ IT, SO WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? BE THE ONLY ONE IN MY FAMILY WHO DOESN'T READ IT? [ LAUGHTER ] THAT COULD HAUNT ME FOREVER."
Steve: WOW. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: INTERESTING. INTERESTING. INTERESTING BLURB. DONALD TRUMP WROTE, "THIS BOOK IS FANTASTIC. I WANT TO ORDER A BILLION MORE COPIES AND USE THEM TO BUILD A A WALL BETWEEN HILLARY AND THE WHITE HOUSE." HE'S OBSESSED WITH BUILDING A A WALL.
Steve: WOW. OUT OF BOOKS.
Jimmy: HE JUST WANTS TO BUILD A WALL. HE'S GOOD AT IT.
Steve: WALL OF KNOWLEDGE.
Jimmy: YEAH. NEXT, CHRIS CHRISTIE WROTE, "WHEN I SAW THE TITLE, 'HARD CHOICES', I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ABOUT ORDERING APPETIZERS AT APPLEBEE'S. I MEAN, YOU GOT QUESADILLAS, MOZZ STICKS, WINGS, BONELESS WINGS, SPINACH DIP, SAMPLER. I USUALLY JUST HAND THE MENU BACK AND SAY, 'YES.'" [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: HE THOUGHT HER BOOK WAS ABOUT --
Steve: HE THOUGHT IT WAS --
Jimmy: ORDERING.
Steve: YEAH, APPETIZERS. GETTING MOZZ STICKS.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND FINALLY, BILL CLINTON WROTE, "IF MY BOOK WERE CALLED 'HARD CHOICES' IT'D BE A POP-UP BOOK." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. [ LAUGHTER ] THE WHOLE THING IS FANTASTIC. OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, A A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SAY THAT GOP CANDIDATE BEN CARSON DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO BE PRESIDENT. OKAY, SO YESTERDAY, HE TRIED TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. BUT I'M NOT SURE IF HE WAS VERY CONVINCING. THIS IS REAL, WE DIDN'T FAKE THIS OR ANYTHING. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS INTERVIEW.
HOW DO YOU HOPE THE CLOSE THE DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE PERSONALLY PREDISPOSED TO LIKE YOU BUT STILL HAVE THOSE RESERVATIONS?
WELL, I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S A MARATHON AND NOT A A SPRINT. OVER THE COURSE OF TIME, THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SEE. YOU KNOW, I'M PRETTY ENERGETIC. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PEOPLE SAY I'M A A REALLY COOL PERSON. FIRST PERSON IN HISTORY TO FALL ASLEEP WHILE SAYING "ENERGETIC." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M ENERGETIC. SOMETHING'S FISHY. THIS ISN'T GOOD. I READ THAT OFFICIALS FROM THE U.S. TREASURY ARE INVESTIGATING WHY ISIS SEEMS TO BE USING SO MANY TRUCKS AND SUVs THAT ARE MADE BY TOYOTA. ISIS SAID THEY WOULD USE BMWs, BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THEY'RE A-HOLES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: OH!
Jimmy: HEY, IF YOU USE NETFLIX, YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS. NETFLIX JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT'S GOING TO RAISE THE PRICE OF ITS STANDARD PLAN. YEAH. FORTUNATELY, IT DOESN'T BOTHER MOST NETFLIX USERS, BECAUSE THEY'RE ON THE ROOMMATE PLAN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SORRY, DALE. AND FINALLY, NEW YORK COMIC-CON IS IN FULL SWING HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. [ CHEERS ] YEAH. IT'S A HUGE EVENT WITH PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD GATHERING TO CELEBRATE COMIC BOOKS, GRAPHIC NOVELS, VIDEO GAMES AND MORE. WE LOVE COMIC-CON. WE LOVE THE SUPER FANS THAT SHOW UP. SO WE SENT OUR WRITER, ARTHUR, OVER THERE TO QUIZ THEM AND TEST THEIR KNOWLEDGE -- BUT NOT ABOUT COMIC BOOKS OR VIDEO GAMES.

OH, YEAH?
Jimmy: PUMPKIN S'MORE. I'M GOING TO DO PUMPKIN.
GO AHEAD. TAKE YOUR FINGER. OH, YOU GOT A SPOON. EXCUSE ME. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND.
Jimmy: NOW, COULD I MAKE THIS INTO COOKIES? NO. YOU DON'T DO THAT. YOU EAT IT RAW.
YEAH, I THINK IT'S MEANT TO BE EATEN RAW. BUT THERE'S NO ISSUE. IT WILL NOT HURT YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE COOKIE DOUGH. OH, MY GOSH. ROOTS, YOU GOTTA TRY THIS.
YOU KNOW I ALWAYS BRING FOR Y'ALL.
Jimmy: I GOT ONE SPOON. USE YOUR FINGER. WHO MAKES THIS? WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE COMPANY? EDOUGHBLE.
YES. THEY'RE EDOUGHBLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE EDOUGHBLE.
THANK YOU. THEY'RE IN LOS ANGELES, AND THEY'RE WONDERFUL.
Jimmy: YOU'RE SO EDOUGHBLE.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THANKS FOR BEING HERE. WE HAVE LOTS TO DISCUSS.
YES.
Jimmy: LAST TIME, YOU SAID YOU HAD A SHOW IDEA ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER, "ACCORDING TO ALEX." NOW IT'S A SHOW.
YES.
Jimmy: IT'S HAPPENING.
IT'S FUN. IT'S THESE TWO WONDERFUL WOMEN WHO ARE IN THEIR 40s, AND THEY HAVE TO REINVENT THEMSELVES. MY DAUGHTER AND HER BEST FRIEND WHO IS ALSO THE CHILD OF A A FAMOUS PERSON, HAVE KIDS AND THEY'RE RAISING THEM TOGETHER. NOW, SUDDENLY, THEIR HUSBANDS ARE DOING WELL AND THEY'RE LIKE, NOW WHAT DO WE DO? THEY'RE THE LOUDEST WOMEN I KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A LOT OF VOLUME.
A LOT OF VOLUME, AND THEY'RE FUN. THEY'RE NOT CRAPPY TO EACH OTHER. IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY AND LOVE. WE JUST WANTED TO PUT SOMETHING NICE IN THE UNIVERSE. AND SO IT'S A GOOD THING. AND SHE'S GOOD. SHE'S FUNNY.
Jimmy: ITS GOOD TO HAVE ON TELEVISION. THAT'S ON CENTRIC, OCTOBER 17th AT 10:00 P.M. ON CENTRIC.
YES.
Jimmy: THEN WE HAVE A NEW BOOK COMING OUT TUESDAY.
YES.
Jimmy: I MEAN, I ALWAYS LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE SO BRUTALLY HONEST AND FUNNY. EVERYTHING YOU SAY MAKES YOU LAUGH OUT LOUD. I CAN JUST GO TO ANY RANDOM PAGE, BUT I'M GOING TO START WITH A CHAPTER. THIS IS THE FIRST THING YOU SEE WHEN YOU OPEN THE BOOK, OKAY. CHAPTER ONE IS LEAVE IT TO BEAVER. [ LAUGHTER ] SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? YOU JUST DON'T STOP. I MEAN, THIS ONE HERE, CHAPTER 13, GET THE F'ING PRENUP. [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYONE SHOULD GET THE PRENUP?
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT. IF YOU GET THE PRENUP, THERE'S NO ARGUMENT. IF YOU DON'T GET DIVORCED, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET DIVORCED, THEN IT'S NOT A A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE PRENUP IS THERE. JUST DO IT AND SHUT UP AND GET HAPPY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S IT, JUST SHUT UP AND GET HAPPY.
GET HAPPY.
Jimmy: THIS WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY. THIS COMES OUT TUESDAY. IF SOMEONE SAYS YOU COMPLETE ME, RUN.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS WAITING FOR YOU TO COMPLETE THEM. BECAUSE THEN THEY'RE DEPENDENT ON YOU. YOU NEED SOMEBODY WHO IS ALREADY COMPLETE. AND IF YOU WANT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T WANT A RELATIONSHIP, FIND SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T MIND A HIT AND RUN WITH YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, HEY, ALL RIGHT. HEY, HEY.
I HAVE TO QUALIFY THAT.
Jimmy: NO, NO, ABSOLUTELY.
I HAVE TO QUALIFY THAT. BECAUSE, WHEN YOU GET TO BE A A CERTAIN AGE AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE HAVING KIDS. OKAY, AND MAYBE YOUR PARTNER HAS PASSED AWAY, AND YOU DON'T WANT A RELATIONSHIP, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT -- BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T STILL WANT SOMEONE TO HUG YOU OR HOLD YOU OR WHATEVER. YOU JUST FIND FRIENDS THAT CAN DO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S -- I KNEW WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. YEAH, HIT AND RUN. GO OUT AND HUG SOMEBODY AND GET OUT OF THERE, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE NOW.
YES.
Jimmy: YOU'RE SO BUSY. BIG STONE GAP. THIS PART WAS WRITTEN FOR YOU.
WELL, YEAH. MY FRIEND ANGIE, SHE'S IS A A WONDERFUL WRITER. SHE HAS WRITTEN MANY, MANY BOOKS. SHE WORKED ON LOTS OF SHOWS. SAID, HEY, I WROTE THIS PART FOR YOU, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO MAKE THE MOVIE YET. SO, I WAS LIKE, OKAY. PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY, I WROTE THIS FOR YOU. WHEN I GET THE MONEY IT WILL BE GREAT. A COUPLE YEARS DOWN, HALLE BERRY'S GOT MY PART. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, WELL, WE HAD TO GO YOUNGER. YOU KNOW. OKAY, I GET IT. BUT 12 YEARS -- NO, SHE SAID IT'S BEEN 14 YEARS. 14 YEARS IT TOOK HER TO GET THE MONEY TO MAKE THE MOVIE. AND IT'S VERY SWEET. IT'S NICE. AND SHE REMEMBERED YOU?
SHE REMEMBERED ME. WHEN YOU SEE THIS, I LOOK LIKE I'VE HAVE EATEN MOST OF THE CAST. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I'M LIKE -- I'M LIKE A A FOOTBALL PLAYER.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
I MEAN, HUGE. BUT I'M FUNNY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE ALWAYS FUNNY. AND YOU RUN AWAY WITH THE MOVIE. [ APPLAUSE ] HIT AND RUN WITH THE MOVIE. IT'S YOU AND ASHLEY JUDD, SHE'S ALSO IN THIS ONE. SHE'S FANTASTIC. HERE'S WHOOPI GOLDBERG IN "BIG STONE GAP." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
HE LIKES AVE MARIA.
GIRL, YOU KNOW LESS ABOUT MEN THAN YOU DO ABOUT COSMETICS.
IF AVE WOULD JUST GIVE HER A A CHANCE, SHE COULD HAVE HIM.
LITTLE GIRL, AVE MARIA DON'T STAND A CHANCE NEXT TO SWEET SUE. SWEET SUE IS A SABERTOOTH DIVORCEE IN NEED OF CASH, AND JACK HAS HIM IS A STEADY JOB. HE GOT NO DEPENDENTS, WHEN IT HIS MOMMA PASSES, HE'S GOING TO GET THE HOUSE ACROSS THE BRIDGE, AND DON'T FORGET WHEN HE WAS 18, HE GOT THAT PENSION FROM THE MINER.
