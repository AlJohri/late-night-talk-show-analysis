Questlove: 469, DALLAS!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY, WELCOME. THAT'S THE ENERGY. THAT'S THE LOVE. THAT'S THE ENERGY. THAT'S THE SPIRIT THAT YOU GET HERE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE THE BIG STORY IS STILL THE ELECTION. AND YESTERDAY ON "GOOD MORNING AMERICA," JOE BIDEN SAID THAT HE'S CONFIDENT THAT HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. THEN HE SAID, "OF COURSE I ALSO BET AGAINST THE MIGHTY DUCKS IN ALL THREE MOVIES, SO WHAT DO I KNOW?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DOCUMENTARY. ACTUALLY, HILLARY'S BEEN HAVING KIND OF A TOUGH TIME LATELY. IN FACT, YESTERDAY, SHE LOST THE WEST VIRGINIA PRIMARY, WHICH CAME AS A SURPRISE SINCE SHE WON THERE IN 2008. OF COURSE, WEST VIRGINIA'S COAL COUNTRY. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT SHE COULD HAVE SAID TO LOSE THEIR VOTE. [ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO PUT A A LOT OF COAL MINERS AND COAL COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS, RIGHT, TIM? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TIM WAS LIKE, "HEY, DON'T BRING ME INTO THIS." [ LAUGHTER ] COAL MINERS ARE LIKE, "EVEN WE CAN'T HELP YOU DIG YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS ONE, LADY, SORRY." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DID THIS. AND TED CRUZ RETURNED TO THE SENATE FOR THE FIRST TIME YESTERDAY SINCE DROPPING OUT OF THE ELECTION. BUT I'M NOT SURE HE UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY HOW DROPPING OUT WORKS.
WE'VE WITHDRAWN FROM THE CAMPAIGN. AND IT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE VOTERS. IF CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, WE WILL ALWAYS ASSESS THE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT I APPRECIATE THE EAGERNESS AND EXCITEMENT OF ALL THE FOLKS IN THE MEDIA TO SEE ME BACK IN THE RING.
Jimmy: OH. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, YOU'RE NOT BACK. NO. TED CRUZ IS LIKE THE EX-BOYFRIEND WHO STILL HANGS OUT WITH YOUR PARENTS EVEN THOUGH YOU BROKE UP FIVE YEARS AGO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "OH, YOU'RE HOME EARLY. JUST TALKING TO YOUR MOM ABOUT WHAT CAR I SHOULD BUY." "YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH MY PARENTS STILL?"
Steve: FIXING YOUR DAD'S COMPUTER.
Jimmy: "HOW WAS THE PARTY? IT WAS GOOD?" [ LAUGHTER ] GET THIS, SOURCES CLAIM THAT THE DRUG LORD, EL CHAPO WILL BE EXTRADITED FROM MEXICO TO BROOKLYN NEXT MONTH. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION, IF WE'RE BRINGING EL CHAPO HERE, WHO EXACTLY ARE WE TRYING TO KEEP OUT WITH THAT GIANT WALL? [ LAUGHTER ] EL CHAPO IS THE MAIN -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, THIS ISN'T GOOD. A VIDEO JUST CAME OUT WHERE QUEEN ELIZABETH IS CAUGHT ON CAMERA REFERRING TO CHINESE OFFICIALS AS VERY RUDE. BUT RATHER THAN APOLOGIZE FOR HER REMARKS, QUEEN ELIZABETH HAS JUST DECIDED TO JUST SAY HOW SHE REALLY FEELS ABOUT A A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF. CHECK OUT WHAT ELSE SHE'S BEEN SAYING. FIRST SHE SAID, "THE MINUTE I GET HOME FROM A PUBLIC APPEARANCE, I CHANGE INTO PAJAMAS AND AN 'I WOKE UP LIKE DIS' SWEATSHIRT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: I WOKE UP LIKE DIS.
Steve: I WOKE UP LIKE DIS.
Jimmy: DIS. YEAH.
Steve: DIS.
Jimmy: THEN SHE SAID, "WHEN I TALK TO PRINCE PHILIP, SOMETIMES I JUST MOUTH THE WORDS SO HE THINKS HIS HEARING HIS WORSE THAN IT REALLY IS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RUDE, THAT'S MEAN, RIGHT?
Steve: THAT'S HURTFUL.
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, SHE SAID, "WE'RE SCREWED IF ENGLAND GETS INVADED, BECAUSE OUR ONLY KNIGHTS ARE ELTON JOHN AND STEPHEN HAWKING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S TRUE, THEY WOULD BE IN TROUBLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DID YOU SEE THIS? I READ A CANADIAN TEENAGER CLAIMS THAT HE'S DISCOVERED THE REMAINS OF A LOST MAYAN CITY BY USING GOOGLE MAPS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH, THE CITY HAS ALL SORTS OF ANCIENT STRUCTURES. INCLUDING ONE PYRAMID, AN ALTAR AND TWO RADIO SHACKS. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: TWO OF THEM.
Steve: THEY'RE STILL OPEN.
Jimmy: SOME BUSINESS NEWS, HERE. THE GAP JUST REPORTED A DECLINE IN SALES FOR ITS FIFTH STRAIGHT QUARTER, AND ANALYSTS ARE SAYING THEY MIGHT HAVE TO CLOSE OVER 100 STORES. BUT LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE, IF THERE'S ONE THING THEY KNOW HOW TO DO AT THE GAP, IT'S FOLD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S WHAT -- THEY'RE GREAT. "PUT THE PANTS BACK, I'LL FOLD THEM, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT." HERE'S A LOCAL STORY, HERE. I READ THAT A NATURE SANCTUARY IN CENTRAL PARK THAT'S BEEN CLOSED SINCE THE 1930s JUST REOPENED. YEAH. OFFICIALS SAY IT WILL BE A NEW EXCITING PLACE FOR NEW YORKERS TO FIND A BODY AT THE START OF A "LAW AND ORDER" EPISODE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "I WAS JUST JOGGING, OFFICER." [ "LAW AND ORDER" CHIMES ] [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, THIS IS PRETTY COOL, HERE. EMPLOYEES AT A DOMINO'S PIZZA SAVED A CUSTOMER'S LIFE BY CHECKING IN ON HIM AFTER THEY DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM BECAUSE HE'S ORDERED PIZZA EVERY DAY FOR TEN YEARS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NO WORD ON WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HIM, BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GUESSING IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH ORDERING A PIZZA EVERY DAY FOR TEN YEARS. [ LAUGTHER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST DOESN'T SOUND -- I READ THAT A TOWN IN TEXAS JUST AGREED TO BUILD A A $62 MILLION STADIUM FOR ITS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM. WHILE THE SCHOOL SOCCER TEAM JUST GOT PERMISSION TO BUY A A BALL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, THIS MADE ME LAUGH. A GUY BROUGHT AN UNUSUAL WORK OF ART ON TO "ANTIQUES ROAD SHOW," WHERE HE GOT A VERY HIGH APPRAISAL. BUT THINGS DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
ESTIMATING ITS VALUE IS A A LITTLE DIFFICULT. I THINK IN A RETAIL SETTING, SOMEBODY MIGHT WELL ASK IN THE AREA BETWEEN $30,000 AND $50,000 FOR THIS.
WHAT?
I THINK IT'S JUST -- IT'S AMAZING. JUST AN AMAZING THING.
NO.
WELL, THAT'S MY OPINION.
THE SHOW BELIEVED THE PIECE WAS FROM THE LATE 19th OR 20th CENTURY. TURNS OUT IT WAS ACTUALLY MADE IN AN OREGON HIGH SCHOOL ART CLASS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

VERY SMALL GROUP. AND THE SHOW WAS ABOUT TO START.
Jimmy: CAMERON DIAZ WAS THERE.
SHE AND I WERE ON A COUCH TOGETHER. I DON'T REALLY KNOW HER. I'M A BIG FAN OF HERS. SHE'S BEEN ON MY SHOW BUT I DON'T KNOW HER LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW. AND WE'RE SITTING THERE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I SMELL THIS SMELL. AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, CAMERON DIAZ PASSED GAS." I HAD SEEN, YOU KNOW, "CHARLIE'S ANGELS" WAS ALL ABOUT WOMEN EMPOWERMENT AND STUFF. I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S COOL, LIKE, GIRLS CAN PASS GAS."
Jimmy: SHE'S NOT MAKING A A STATEMENT.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS. YEAH, MAN, LET IT RIP, CAMERON, WHATEVER. LET'S WATCH THE OSCARS.
Jimmy: CAMERON DIAZ.
YEAH, SO THEN IT GOT WORSE. THE SMELL, ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT GETS MUCH WORSE. I WAS, LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, CAMERON DIAZ POOPED HER PANTS IS WHAT HAPPENED."
Jimmy: THAT'S INSANE.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: THAT'S INSANE TO THINK THAT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS CRAZY TOO.
Jimmy: INSANE TO THINK THAT.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: HUMAN BEINGS DON'T DO THAT.
WELL, I THOUGHT SHE DID. ON THE BIGGEST NIGHT IN HOLLYWOOD. AND SO THEN I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO." THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE GOES, OH, MY GOD, THERE'S A TERRIBLE SMELL. AND THEN THE ROOM ALL STARTED TO SMELL IT. AND SOMEONE SAID, "OH, IT'S GARY."

AND I SAID TO HER, WOW, THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU, I THOUGHT YOU POOPED YOUR PANTS, REMEMBER? BUT I GUESS I HAD NEVER TOLD HER THAT NIGHT THAT I THOUGHT THE SMELL WAS FROM HER. AND SHE, I GUESS, WAS LIKE, OH, OKAY. AND THEN SHE'S ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW" AND THEN SHE REVEALED THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW I THOUGHT THAT.
