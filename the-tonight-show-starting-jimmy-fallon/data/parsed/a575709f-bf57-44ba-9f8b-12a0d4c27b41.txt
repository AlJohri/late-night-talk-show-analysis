Jimmy: I DON'T THINK OF IT EITHER. BUT I WRESTLED WITH HIM A A COUPLE TIMES.
YOU DID?
Jimmy: SHIRTLESS. WE WERE BOTH SHIRTLESS. WE HAD OUR PANTS ON. AND YOU KNOW, WE WERE -- I GOT HIM IN THIS LEG LOCK. HIS FACE WAS DOWN BY MY FEET AND MY HEAD WAS UP BY HIS ANKLES. AND MY FEET GOT STUCK TO HIS BACK HAIR SO HARD -- BILL PAXTON'S BACK HAIR SO HARD IT RIPPED OFF. IT WAS LIKE I WAS WEARING VELCRO SHOES OR SOMETHING.
OH! THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE. WELL, LISTEN. I'M TELLING YOU, THIS SECURITY GUARD, HE HAD A STORY TO TELL. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE HAD PAXTON'S SHIRT OFF. THEY GET INTO AN AWKWARD SITUATION. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE HE'S UPSET. AND HIS TETHER BALL IS NEAR HIM. AND -- I MEAN THAT'S THE -- I'M USING A CODE WORD NOW FOR SOMETHING ELSE.
Jimmy: NO, I KNOW. I KIND OF KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I GOT IN KIND OF THE SAME TUSSLE WITH BILL PAXTON.
YOU'RE KIDDING.
Jimmy: JUST FOR FUN. AND THAT EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME.
WHAT HAPPENED?
Jimmy: WELL, HE SAID -- I'M TRYING TO DESCRIBE IT TO MY WIFE. SHE SAID, "WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?"
SHE DID? WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?
Jimmy: IT LOOKED LIKE TWO BEARD NESTS. ♪♪
WOW! TETHER BALL AND TWO BEARD NESTS.

Jimmy: RUTH.
HELLO.
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
THANK YOU. THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE BRITISH UNTIL I SAW YOU WIN. BECAUSE YOU ACTED WITH AN AMERICAN ACCENT.
I DID TRY, YEAH.
Jimmy: NO, YOU DO A GREAT JOB. CLEARLY, BECAUSE YOU WON THE GOLDEN GLOBE.
I KNOW. WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MADE ME WIN A GOLDEN GLOBE.
Jimmy: YEAH, LOOK. YOU WON THE GOLDEN GLOBE THERE. I WAS WATCHING. I SAW YOU. YOU GOT UP AND YOU GO, [ IN ENGLISH ACCENT ] "THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THIS." AND I GO, "WAIT. ARE YOU PUTTING -- ARE YOU DOING A BIT?" [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T KNOW. THAT WAS A BAD ENGLISH ACCENT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT CAN DO A BIT OF WORK. IT'S GOOD ENOUGH.
Jimmy: YOU GREW UP IN WHERE?
I GREW UP IN SHEPPERTON, IN LONDON, WHICH IS -- ACTUALLY THERE'S A STUDIO THERE, A FILM STUDIO.
Jimmy: OH, IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH. THEY DID "HARRY POTTER" AND THEY DID "STAR WARS."
Jimmy: SO DOES EVERYONE IN TOWN WANT TO BE AN ACTOR AND AN ACTRESS?
NO, NOT REALLY. WE DID GO AND TRY AND -- ME AND MY BROTHER, I'VE GOT A BROTHER HERE, ACTUALLY. HE'S IN THE AUDIENCE. BUT WE WENT AND WE JUST SORT OF -- HELLO. [ LAUGHTER ] WE WENT -- USED TO GO AROUND THE STUDIOS AND TRY TO SEE -- SPOT FILM STARS. SLY STALLONE WAS THERE ONCE, FOR "JUDGE DREDD." THAT WAS A HIGHLIGHT OF MY CHILDHOOD.
Jimmy: "JUDGE DREDD" WAS BEING FILMED DOWN THE STREET? DID YOU RUN INTO SYLVESTER STALLONE?
WE DIDN'T SEE ANYONE. WE NEVER SAW ANYONE.
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T GET TO MEET HIM?
NO.
Jimmy: OH, HE'S SO FUN.
YEAH, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AMAZING. BUT NO, I DIDN'T GET TO SEE HIM.
Jimmy: WELL, IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES, JUST ASK ME WHATEVER YOU WOULD ASK HIM?
ARE THOSE MUSCLES REAL?
Jimmy: [ MUMBLING ] [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I OPENED MY EYES, AND I RUINED IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WANT TO MAKE DREAMS COME TRUE. I WANT TO MAKE DREAMS COME TRUE ON THIS SHOW, ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW." SO THERE YOU GO. IT'S LIKE YOU JUST MET HIM. IT'S FANTASTIC.
IT WAS. IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE I JUST MET HIM.
Jimmy: BUT YOU GOT INTO ACTING -- I HEARD YOU WERE A LITTLE KID. YOU WERE SEVEN OR EIGHT WHEN YOU GOT THE BUG. YOU WERE LIKE, "OH, I WANT TO BE AN ACTOR." YOU USED TO REENACT "PLATOON" IN YOUR BEDROOM? OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THE SCENE WHERE HE'S ON HIS KNEES?
YEAH. NO, YEAH, IT WAS QUITE WEIRD. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THIS. I USED TO WATCH QUITE A LOT OF INAPPROPRIATE THINGS I SHOULDN'T HAVE WATCHED AT EIGHT.
Jimmy: EIGHT YEARS OLD, WATCHING "PLATOON." THAT'S PRETTY ADVANCED. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, I'VE GOT BROTHERS.
Jimmy: I'VE GOT TO THANK YOUR BROTHER FOR THAT. "HEY, YOU SCREWED ME UP. THANK YOU, MAN."
IT WAS "TWIN PEAKS" AND "PLATOON" AND I USED TO -- YEAH, I USED TO REENACT. IT WAS A BIG CLASSICAL MUSIC MOMENT AT THE END WHEN HE IS ON HIS KNEES AND GETS SHOT LIKE 95 TIMES. THE GUY DOESN'T DIE. HE GETS SHOT IN SLOW MOTION.
Jimmy: OH, I REMEMBER. IT'S FAMOUS.
I USED TO LOCK THE DOORS AND JUST DO IT TO MYSELF.
Jimmy: NOW, WOULD YOU PLAY MUSIC, OR WERE YOU JUST --
YEAH. NO, I PLAYED THE MUSIC. I HAD THE SOUNDTRACK. I HAVE THE MUSIC.
Jimmy: EVERY KID GETS "THE WIGGLES" AND THE "PLATOON" SOUNDTRACK. [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYBODY -- KIDS LOVE IT. OH, MY GOSH. THEIR FAVORITE SOUNDTRACKS.
I USED TO PUT IT ON AND JUST SORT OF REENACT GETTING SHOT.
Jimmy: WHAT DID THAT LOOK LIKE MAYBE? COME ON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DO YOU MIND?
I'LL DO IT. RIGHT, OKAY. OKAY. I'M GOING TO TAKE MY SHOES OFF FOR THIS. AND I MIGHT HAVE TO DIRECT MYSELF THROUGH IT. ♪♪

Jimmy: GOOD FOR YOU. EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS. I WANT TO SEE THIS AS WELL. IT'S KIND OF A TRICKY PLOT, I WOULD SAY.
YEAH. IT'S LIKE A LOVE STORY THAT'S TOLD THROUGH THE IDEA OF PARALLEL UNIVERSES. SO IT'S LIKE THE IDEA OF BOY MEETS GIRL, BOY MEETS GIRL AGAIN, BOY MEETS GIRL AGAIN. IT'S A BIT -- IT'S A MAJOR MOMENT.
Jimmy: BUT A COUPLE SCENES ARE ONLY LIKE SIX SECONDS.
YEAH. SIX OR THREE SECONDS AND THEN SOME ARE SEVEN MINUTES.
Jimmy: HOW MANY SCENES DO YOU DO?
IT'S LIKE 65 SCENES IN 68 MINUTES.
Jimmy: WOW. THAT'S SO FUN. AND IT'S JUST YOU AND JAKE ON STAGE?
