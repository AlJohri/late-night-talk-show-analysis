Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS! THAT'S WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOT CROWD! WELCOME. WELCOME, EVERYBODY, TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD -- LOOKING GOOD OUT THERE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN TONIGHT. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WHILE HE WAS IN JAPAN TODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA VISITED A A SCIENCE MUSEUM. WHERE HE ACTUALLY PLAYED SOCCER WITH A ROBOT. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. BIDEN IS NEGOTIATING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER IN UKRAINE, AND OBAMA IS PLAYING SOCCER WITH A A ROBOT. IT'S LIKE THE WHITE HOUSE VERSION OF "FREAKY FRIDAY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ ROBOT VOICES ] GOAL, GOAL.
Steve: GOAL.
Jimmy: GOAL.
Steve: BEEP BLORP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OF COURSE, THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE STILL HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE WORRIED. AND NOW THE FAA IS BANNING U.S. AIRLINES FROM FLYING NEAR CRIMEA. SO, IF YOU WERE PLANNING ON A A SUMMER VACATION TO A PLACE WHERE FAMILIES ARE TORN APART BY CONFLICT, YOU'LL HAVE TO STICK WITH DISNEY WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] WE ALREADY WENT ON SMALL WORLD! WE ALREADY WENT ON IT! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I AIN'T WAITING ON LINE AGAIN! OH, MAN, THIS IS NOT GOOD HERE. YANKEES' PITCHER MICHAEL PINEDA WAS EJECTED LAST NIGHT FOR HAVING PINE TAR ON HIS NECK AND RUBBING IT ON HIS HAND TO GET A A BETTER GRIP ON THE BALL. BECAUSE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL RULES STATE THAT ALL ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES MUST BE PUT INSIDE YOUR BODY. NOT ON THE OUTSIDE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A RULE.
Steve: GOT TO INJECT IT.
Jimmy: I DID NOT KNOW THAT. I DIDN'T KNOW BASEBALL PLAYERS HAD TROUBLE GRIPPING THEIR BALLS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: ALL THE STEROIDS.
Jimmy: YEAH, I GUESS. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON. THE WHITE HOUSE IS FACING A LOT OF CRITICISM OVER PROPOSED CHANGES TO ITS NET NEUTRALITY POLICY WHICH WOULD ALLOW COMPANIES TO HAVE FASTER WEB TRAFFIC IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY.
Tariq: GESH. WHAT IS THIS GUY DRONING ON ABOUT NOW? ALL I HEARD WAS THE WORD INTERNET AND THEN BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. MAN, I LOVE THE INTERNET. JUST THE OTHER DAY I WAS WATCHING A VIDEO WHERE THIS FAT GUY TRIED TO JUMP ON A A SKATEBOARD AND THEN TRIPPED AND STUMBLED HEAD FIRST INTO A A CAR BUMPER. MAN, I SWEAR, JIMMY KNEW HOW MUCH OF MY WORKDAY I SPENT MESSING AROUND ONLINE, HE WOULD FIRE ME. OH, CRAP JIMMY IS TALKING TO ME.
Jimmy: TARIQ?
Tariq: YEAH?
Jimmy: I SAID, WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THE ISSUE?
Tariq: OH, UH, I MEAN, YEAH. WELL, JIMMY, NET NEUTRALITY IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX SUBJECT. I MEAN, TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT, YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNING.
Jimmy: WHOA-OH. I WAS NOT EXPECTING TARIQ TO KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT NET NEUTRALITY. I DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT NET NEUTRALITY. I WAS JUST READING THE QUEUE CARDS. THE ONLY THING I REALLY USE THE INTERNET FOR IS WATCHING FUNNY VIDEOS. JUST THE OTHER DAY, I SAW THIS ONE WHERE THIS GUY TRY TO JUMP ON A SKATEBOARD AND HE TRIPPED AND STUMBLED HEAD FIRST INTO A A CAR BUMPER. OH, MAN I SWEAR, IF TARIQ EVER FOUND OUT HOW MUCH OF MY WORKDAY I SPENT GOOFING AROUND ONLINE, I'D FIRE HIM. OH, CRAP. TARIQ IS TALKING TO ME.
Tariq: I SAID, WOULDN'T YOU AGREE, JIMMY?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, LET'S JUST LOOK AT A CLIP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

SO, IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO GOES TO HOOTERS ENOUGH TO TAKE PART IN THEIR LOYALTY PROGRAM, I'M SORRY YOUR WIFE GOT THE HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS A WEIRD STORY. A MAN IN VIRGINIA IS SUING A A DOCTOR FOR MOCKING HIM WHILE HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS DURING A A COLONOSCOPY. [ LAUGHTER ] OR THE GUY JUST TOOK IT THE WRONG WAY WHEN THE DOCTOR WAS LIKE WOW, WHAT AN A- HOLE. [ LAUGHTER ] MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I'VE EVER SEEN. IT'S PERFECT. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, I SAW THIS WEEK RYAN SEACREST IS CELEBRATING THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS RADIO SHOW. YEAH. WHEN ASKED WHAT HE WANTED FOR HIS ANNIVERSARY, SEACREST WAS LIKE "SLEEP." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M SO TIRED. I'M SO TIRED. I HAVE 100 JOBS. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE CELEBRATING A BIG ANNIVERSARY. I ALSO WANT TO SAY CONGRATS TO "INSIDE EDITION" BECAUSE THIS MARKS THEIR 25th YEAR ON THE AIR. THEY'VE BEEN GIVING US ENTERTAINMENT NEWS NIGHT AFTER NIGHT FOR OVER TWO DECADES. LATELY, I THINK THEY'RE STARTING TO RUN OUT OF IDEAS. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT I MEAN.
WHEN WE COME BACK, THE LONELIEST DOG ON THE WORLD. COMING UP. NEXT TIME FOR A WOOD CHUCK. AND STILL TO COME, HOW NOT TO OPERATE A FORKLIFT. AND COMING UP, HOW NOT TO RIDE A BIKE.

IT'S SO DEPRESSING IN YOUR HEART. IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT BEING AN ACTOR, THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO BE JAMES VAN DER BEEK. IT WAS "LAW AND ORDER?"
IT WAS FOR "LAW AND ORDER."
Jimmy: NEW YORK. THAT'S IT. "LAW AND ORDER."
Jimmy: "LAW AND ORDER," YOU GOTTA DO IT. BIG BREAK.
BIG BREAK. BIG SHOW. I WAS TOLD, "LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T DO WELL IN THIS AUDITION -- IF YOU DON'T GET THIS PART, YOU DO WELL, THEY'LL PUT YOU IN AN EPISODE. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO ARREST OR WHATEVER.
Jimmy: YEAH, SO NO BIG DEAL.
IT'S THE LONGEST-RUNNING SHOW LIKE ALMOST EVER PRACTICALLY. SO I STUDY ON THE TRAIN GOING IN. I GET IN, I'M SITTING AT THIS GUY'S -- ACROSS FROM THIS GUY WHO'S AT A DESK. AND I READ AND I DO MY THING. AND HE'S LIKE, "THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT WAS GREAT." I'M LIKE, "THAT WAS GREAT. AWESOME. YES." I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. THANK YOU SO MUCH." I WALK OUT THE DOOR AND I REALIZE I FORGOT MY BACKPACK. SO NOW I HAVE TO, LIKE -- YOU KNOW, "SORRY, I FORGOT MY BACK --" SO I SNEAK ON IN. AND I GO TO PICK UP MY BACKPACK AND IT'S SITTING NEXT TO ONE OF THOSE WIRE MESH TRASH CANS. I GO TO PICK UP THE BACKPACK AND MY HEAD SHOT IS IN THE WIRE MESH TRASH CAN. [ AUDIENCE AWWS ] HEAD SIDE DOWN.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS. I LOVE IT.
SEE YOU LATER, IT WAS A LONG TRAIN RIDE BACK TO CONNECTICUT THAT DAY.
Jimmy: NO. HERE'S THE GOOD PART OF THE STORY. HE ENDED UP BEING ON "LAW AND ORDER."
I DID. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEARS LATER, WHEN HE'S A STAR. SO HE SHOWED THAT GUY! I LOVE THAT STORY. SO HEARTBREAKING, BUT IT'S SO TRUE. ALL THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN LIKE THAT. NOW YOU HAVE A NEW SHOW. IT'S A BIG HIT ON CBS. "FRIENDS WITH BETTER LIVES."
YUP.
Jimmy: GREAT TITLE. GREAT CAST.
GREAT CAST. WE'VE GOT BROOKLYN DECKER, WE GOT ZOE-LISTER JONES, WE GOT CONNOLLY.
Jimmy: KEVIN CONNOLLY.
YEAH, KEVIN CONNOLLY, BRO. [ MIMICING KEVIN CONNOLLY ] BRO, BRO, BRO.
Jimmy: OH, BRO. BRO, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN -- MAN, I'LL TRY, BRO. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT, BRO. KEVIN CONNOLLY, YOU GOTTA SAY WHAT'S UP TO HIM. WE LOVE HIM SO MUCH.
YEAH HE'S THE BEST.
Jimmy: HE'S THE GREATEST. AND IT'S GOOD FOR YOU TO DO COMEDY, BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY FUNNY.
WELL THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: DOING BITS ON "DAWSON'S."
I'VE CRIED ENOUGH ON TV FOR ONE LIFETIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU REALLY HAVE.
YEAH, I THINK I'VE PUT IN MY TEARS.
Jimmy: SO THERE WON'T BE A A VERY SPECIAL EPISODE OF "FRIENDS WITH BETTER LIVES" WHERE YOU CRY?
NOT IN SEASON ONE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT YOU STILL COME INTO THE BEDROOM THROUGH THE WINDOW.
NO.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. YOU DON'T DO THAT. ALL RIGHT. NO.
NO. AND I'VE GOT TO THANK THE ROOTS FOR NOT PLAYING PAULA COLE, BY THE WAY, WHEN I CAME OUT.
Jimmy: AH. THEY'RE TRICKY. THE THINK THINGS OVER. THEY THINK OF THIS STUFF. WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH. JAMES VAN DER BEEK. YOU CAN WATCH "FRIENDS WITH BETTER LIVES" MONDAYS AT 8:30 P.M. ON CBS.
