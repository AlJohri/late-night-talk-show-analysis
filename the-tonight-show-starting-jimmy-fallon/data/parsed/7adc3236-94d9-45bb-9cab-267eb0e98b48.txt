WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WHERE ARE YOU GOING NOW?
Jimmy: WHAT I'M SAYING IS, YOU CHALLENGED ME TO A GAME OF MARIO KART. AND I SAID "YES."
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE MOST COURTEOUS THING TO DO IN THAT SITUATION.
Jimmy: I AGREE. AND WE HAD FUN.
THAT'S WHY I WASN'T LOOK -- BY THE WAY, THE REASON I WASN'T LOOKING IN YOUR EYES WAS I WAS GETTING A VERY WEIRD VIBE FROM YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAME IN, YOU WENT RIGHT TO THE CELERY. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
THIS IS WHAT I WAS DOING.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU DID THAT. I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CROUTE A A TARTE BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING TO GO BAD IF YOU DON'T EAT IT. HOW MUCH CELERY ARE YOU GOING TO EAT?
I WAS GOING TO EAT IT.
Jimmy: ALL THAT CELERY?
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHY IT WAS THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHY MOST OF IT WAS THERE.
OKAY.
Jimmy: I WENT IN AND GRABBED A CELERY STICK. AND YOU SAID, "LET'S DO THIS, OLD MAN."
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE, RIGHT?
