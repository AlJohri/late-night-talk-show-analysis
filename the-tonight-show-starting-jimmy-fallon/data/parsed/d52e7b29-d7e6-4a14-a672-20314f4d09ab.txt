OKAY, SO THE QUALITY WENT UP AND DOWN.
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT FUN, THOUGH?
HOWEVER -- YES, OH, YEAH. BUT THE RUSH TO THE STAGE, WHEN PRINCE WENT ON, DID HAPPEN. I THREW A PIECE OF PIZZA IN JOHNNY KNOXVILLE'S FACE AND GOT AN EDGE IN THERE. AND THAT WAS LEGITIMATELY AMAZING. BUT, WHEN JIMMY AND CHRIS ROCK STARTED BEING WENDY AND LISA TO PRINCE AND JIMMY -- HE GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEES. I SAID, "THIS IS GETTING DANGEROUS AND I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE."

Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. THAT WAS IT? THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED TO SAY?
NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT FELT LIKE YOU STOPPED YOURSELF. ARE YOU THINKING OF CRAWLING THROUGH PRINCE'S LEGS RIGHT NOW FOR A DIFFERENT THING?
I DID NOTICE THOUGH THAT -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED. I FELT LIKE THIS WAS LIKE THE WAY THAT COMEDIANS GET BACK AT DRAMATIC ACTORS OR SOMETHING. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED, BUT LIKE I WAS TINY. THEY PUT ME ON A STOOL THAT WAS LIKE THIS AND HADER WAS LIKE THIS TALL NEXT TO ME. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THIS!
Jimmy: BILL HADER IS SEVEN FOOT NINE.
I AM SIX FEET TALL. I AM AN INCH TALLER THAN BILL HADER. AND IT'S LIKE THE HOBBIT CAM. IT'S LIKE GANDALF AND BILBO BAGGINS.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT. EDWARD, I SAID THIS TO YOU YESTERDAY BEFORE THE SHOW, BUT I'LL SAY IT TO YOU AGAIN OUT HERE, YOU WERE PHENOMENAL IN "BIRDMAN", AND YOU WERE PHENOMENAL IN "GRAND BUDAPEST" AS WELL. YOU'RE A GREAT ACTOR. YOU'RE ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS. [ APPLAUSE ] "BIRDMAN." IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN "BIRDMAN", GO SEE IT. EVERYONE'S PHENOMENAL. BUT YOU -- I GO, "OH, MY GOSH." THIS IS JUST SUCH A GREAT ROLE. TO PLAY AN ACTOR PLAYING AN ACTOR, AND THEN ACTING FAKE IN THE FAKE MOVIE IN THE REAL -- I GO, IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME. AND THEN IT'S ALSO -- IT'S GOT TO BE A LOT OF PRESSURE TOO BECAUSE IT'S LIKE ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT. SO, IT'S LIKE SOMEONE DOES A A BIG SCENE HERE AND THAT WORKS. AND THEN ANOTHER SCENE HERE. AND THEN, THE CAMERA'S ABOUT TO CUT TO YOU. YOU CAN'T SCREW UP YOUR LINES BECAUSE THEN YOU RUIN THEIR SCENE.
YEAH, THERE'S RARELY THAT KIND OF LIKE CO-DEPENDENCY, YOU KNOW, SYMBIOTIC DEPENDENCY AMONG A CAST AND CREW. YOU KNOW, YOU MAKE FILMS AND THERE'S A CERTAIN RHYTHM YOU GET USED TO. YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYBODY'S INVOLVED IN EVERY SHOT AND PEOPLE KIND OF TAKE A BREAK. IN THIS FILM, BECAUSE OF THIS VERY, VERY COMPLEX WAY THAT THEY MADE THE FILM, EVERYBODY RELIED ON EVERYBODY ELSE ALMOST EVERY SHOT. AND WHEN YOU GOT THROUGH IT, IT HAD THE QUALITY OF LIKE A A WORLD CUP SOCCER GOAL. YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE CAST AND CREW WENT UP IN CELEBRATION EVERY TIME YOU MADE IT THROUGH, YOU KNOW. AND IT WAS -- IT CREATED -- I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: YOU FEEL IT WATCHING THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT'S TENSE AND IT'S GREAT.
IT WAS TENSE AND EXUBERANT AT THE SAME TIME. AND I THINK IT MADE FOR AN ESPECIALLY BONDING EXPERIENCE WITH EVERYONE ON IT. IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP HERE. THIS IS A SCENE WHERE -- YOU'RE LIKE THE ACTOR'S ACTOR.
YEAH, HE'S A METHOD ACTOR. IT'S A SCENE WHERE HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING DRUNK. AND SO HE HAS BEEN. BUT MICHAEL KEATON DOESN'T LIKE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING, AND HE TRIED TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM.
Jimmy: SO HE PUTS LIKE WATER --
WATER, YEAH.
Jimmy: INSTEAD OF GIN ON THE STAGE. AND WATCH WHAT HIS CHARACTER DOES.
ON BROADWAY.
Jimmy: EDWARD NORTON OPPOSITE MICHAEL KEATON IN "BIRDMAN". IN THEATERS RIGHT NOW. CHECK IT OUT.
IT WAS KILLING ME GUY.
DID YOU REPLACE MY GIN WITH WATER AND --
COME ON.
NO. COME ON WHAT?
COME ON, YOU'RE DRUNK.
I'M DRUNK? YES, I'M DRUNK! I'M SUPPOSED TO BE. WHY AREN'T YOU DRUNK? THIS IS CARVER. HE LEFT A PIECE OF HIS LIVER ON THE TABLE EVERY TIME HE WROTE A A [ MUTED ] PAGE. IF I NEED TO BE DRINKING GIN, WHO THE -- ARE YOU TO CUTCH MY GIN, MAN? LISTEN. YOU -- WITH THE PERIOD. YOU -- WITH THE PLOT SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE THE BEST LINES. YOU LEAVE ME THE -- . COME ON, PEOPLE. DON'T BE PATHETIC. STOP LOOKING AT THE WORLD THROUGH YOUR CELL PHONE SCREENS. HAVE A REAL EXPERIENCE! IF ANYBODY GIVES A -- ABOUT PROOF OTHER THAN ME, I MEAN -- THE ONLY THING THAT'S REAL ON THIS STAGE IS THE CHICKEN.
SHUT UP.
DON'T TELL ME TO --
WORK WITH THE CHICKEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, IT'S SO GOOD. EDWARD NORTON! CONGRATULATIONS ON THE NOMINATION. YOU DESERVE ALL THE ACCOLADES, BUDDY. "BIRDMAN" IS IN THEATERS NOW. THE HILARIOUS CRAIG ROBINSON JOINS US AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. ONCE AGAIN, EDWARD NORTON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. I SHOULD MENTION EDWARD, YOU HAVE A MOVIE COMING OUT ON NETFLIX MARCH 6th.
WONDERFUL DOCUMENTARY CALLED "MY OWN MAN." IT'S JUST A HILARIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL FILM ABOUT A GUY ABOUT TO BECOME A FATHER WHO WANTED TO EXPLORE HIS OWN RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER. AND HOW WE BECOME MEN IN TODAY'S WORLD. I'M JUST VERY, VERY, PROUD OF IT.
Jimmy: I MEAN, IT'S CHARMING AND ITS GOOD. MARCH 6TH ON NETFLIX. CHECK THAT OUT YOU GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW OUR NEXT GUEST FROM HIS WORK ON "THE OFFICE" AND MOVIES LIKE "HOT TUB TIME MACHINE" AND "THIS IS THE END." LATER THIS YEAR YOU CAN SEE HIM ON HIS OWN TV SHOW "MR. ROBINSON" HERE ON NBC. STARTING FRIDAY YOU CAN SEE HIM IN THE NEW MOVIE "HOT TUB TIME MACHINE 2." LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME CRAIG ROBINSON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU GOT THE MOVES.
THAT WAS ALL RIGHT AND THERE'S CARPET HERE TOO SO.
Jimmy: HE GOT THE MOVES RIGHT THERE. YOU JUST CAME FROM NEW ORLEANS, RIGHT?
NAWLINS, YES.
Jimmy: NAWLINS.
COULDN'T BE AT THAT PARTY YOU WERE AT. THAT WAS SENSATIONAL. WHY NOT BE AT MARDI GRAS? IN THE BACCHUS PARADE.
Jimmy: SOMETIMES I'M AFRAID OF NEW ORLEANS. BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T CLOSE DOWN.
YEAH. THE ALCOHOL KEEPS GOING.
Jimmy: YEAH. I NEED SOMEONE TO SAY IT'S OVER, DUDE, YOU'VE GOT TO GO. [ LAUGHTER ]
WE SHOT "HOT TUB 2" THERE AND WE SHOT "THIS IS THE END." I'VE DONE A FEW MOVIES THERE. AND THAT'S USUALLY THE GOAL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE, JUST DON'T DIE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HERE'S YOU AT THE PARADE, THIS IS YESTERDAY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: LOOK AT THAT. WHAT, ARE YOU THROWING BEADS AT EVERYBODY?
THROWING BEADS. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S COOL MAN.
YOU KNOW, I WAS NOT PREPARED EMOTIONALLY TO BE IN A FLOAT. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW, YOU JUST RUN THROUGH THIS GAMUT OF EMOTIONS. IT STARTED OFF EVERYBODY'S SCREAMING. OH, YEAH, THIS IS NICE. THIS IS REALLY NICE. THEY LIKE ME, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'? [ LAUGHTER ] THEN YOU REALIZE, THEY JUST WANT BEADS. BUT I KNOW YOU'RE A MUSICIAN AS WELL. THAT'S WHAT YOUR TV SHOW "MR. ROBINSON" GOING TO BE ABOUT.
YES, IT'S BASED ON WHEN I TAUGHT KINDERGARTEN. WELL, I TAUGHT KINDERGARTEN THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE. BUT IT'S BASED ON WHEN WE MADE THE KIDS A LITTLE OLDER. BUT, I WAS A MUSIC TEACHER IN CHICAGO AND INDIANA. IT WAS FOUR YEARS. NOW WE'RE DOING A SHOW ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: BUT, YOU'RE ALSO PLAYING MUSIC IN THE MOVIE. IN "HOT TUB TIME MACHINE 2" YOU GO BACK IN TIME AND STEAL ALL THE GOOD SONGS AND YOU COME OUT. AND SO YOU END UP BEING A A GENIUS. YOU WRITE ALL THE CLASSIC SONGS LIKE "MMMBOP." YOU END UP WRITING THAT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE YOU TOOK THE SONGS FROM THE --
"CALL ME MAYBE," YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE BEST POP SONG EVER WRITTEN, I WOULD SAY. ARGUABLY.
YEAH, MY CHARACTER, I MEAN HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY REMEMBER ALL THE WORDS. HE'S GOOD WITH THE MELODY BUT HE DOESN'T REMEMBER ALL THE WORDS TO THE SONG. SO HE JUST HAS TO DO THE BEST HE CAN. AND HE'S CONFLICTED BECAUSE HE FEELS BAD ABOUT HAVING STOLEN THIS MUSIC BUT HE KNOWS HE HAS TO GET IT OUT. AT THE SAME TIME HE NEEDS TO EAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
