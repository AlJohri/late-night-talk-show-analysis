[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW!" LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, FANTASTIC. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT, EVERYBODY. I SAW THAT IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, SARAH PALIN SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES. AND SAID THAT WHEN IMMIGRANTS ARE IN THE U.S., THEY SHOULD, QUOTE, "SPEAK AMERICAN." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN IMMIGRANTS ARE LIKE, "YOU FIRST." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT LANGUAGE IS "REFUDIATE?" IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE IS WEIGHING IN ON TRUMP. IN AN INTERVIEW LAST WEEK, HILLARY CLINTON CALLED DONALD TRUMP'S CANDIDACY, "AN UNFORTUNATE DEVELOPMENT." [ LAUGHTER ] INCIDENTALLY, "AN UNFORTUNATE DEVELOPMENT," IS ALSO WHAT TRUMP SAYS WHEN HIS WIVES TURN 40. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ TRUMP IMPRESSION ] "IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE. VERY UNFORTUNATE DEVELOPMENT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DID YOU SEE THAT HILLARY WAS ON MSNBC FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH ANDREA MITCHELL ON FRIDAY, AND THE INTERVIEW LASTED NEARLY HALF AN HOUR. YEAH. WE CAN'T SHOW YOU THE WHOLE INTERVIEW, BUT WE WERE ABLE TO CONDENSE IT DOWN TO SHOW YOU WHAT HILLARY REALLY WANTED TO SAY.
STOP ASKING ME ABOUT MY [ BLEEP ] E-MAILS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO.
Steve: WOAH. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE IDEA. I MEAN, REALLY. WE'RE ALL LAUGHING, BUT IF I ASKED TO SEE YOUR E-MAILS, YOU WOULD PROBABLY LIGHT YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE. I MEAN, REALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND ALSO, I SAW THAT A BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT, OKAY, IS SAYING THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN DISPLAYING SIGNS OF SADNESS AND ANXIETY WHEN DISCUSSING HER E-MAIL SCANDAL. TAKE A LOOK.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE LOOKS PRETTY UPSET. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT SAME EXPERT HAS BEEN OBSERVING ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES' BODY LANGUAGE, AS WELL. AND HERE'S WHAT HE FOUND. HERE'S A PHOTO OF DONALD TRUMP. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] HIS BODY LANGUAGE IS SAYING, "I'M RIDING MY INVISIBLE JET-PACK RIGHT NOW, AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME I'M NOT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ WHIRRING SOUND ] NEXT WE HAVE -- HERE'S A PHOTO OF CARLY FIORINA. YEP. HER BODY LANGUAGE IS SAYING, "NO, YOU'VE HAD TOO MANY MARGARITAS! DON'T POINT AT ME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "DON'T POINT AT ME." HERE IS A PHOTO OF RAND PAUL. HIS BODY LANGUAGE IS SAYING, "I JUST GOT MY HAIR DONE, AND MY NAILS DID." THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THERE'S A PHOTO OF TED CRUZ. HIS BODY LANGUAGE IS SAYING, "UH, HIS FULL NAME WAS ACTUALLY CAPTAIN JAMES TIBERIUS KIRK, OKAY?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AFTER THAT, WE HAVE A PHOTO OF LINDSEY GRAHAM. HIS BODY LANGUAGE IS SAYING, "I WISH I HAD ME A LITTLE CORN COB TO NIBBLE ON RIGHT NOW." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "TINY LITTLE THING."
Steve: TINY LITTLE GUY. SWEET TEA! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, HERE'S A A PHOTO OF CHRIS CHRISTIE. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] HIS BODY LANGUAGE IS SAYING, "UH-OH. ICE CREAM, CHEESECAKE, PUMPKIN PIE, CREME BRULEE, BLUEBERRY COBBLER HEADACHE! I HATE WHEN I GET THOSE!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] UGH! SOME SPORTS NEWS. SERENA AND VENUS WILLIAMS PLAYED EACH OTHER AT THE U.S. OPEN QUARTERFINALS TODAY. BUT THEIR MOM DID NOT ATTEND THE MATCH. THEIR MOTHER SAYS THAT SHE LOVES BOTH OF HER DAUGHTERS, SO IT'S UNFAIR TO BE FORCED TO PICK A FAVORITE -- SERENA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "DON'T MAKE ME CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM."
Steve: YEAH, COME ON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS GOING VIRAL. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS? KANSAS STATE'S MARCHING BAND GAVE A HALFTIME PERFORMANCE. DID YOU SEE THIS? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY WANTED TO CREATE A A FORMATION THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE STAR TREK'S "U.S.S. ENTERPRISE" ENTERING THE MOUTH OF THEIR RIVAL'S MASCOT, BUT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING ELSE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU TELL ME. CHECK IT OUT. WATCH THIS.
IT APPEARS THE STAR SHIP ENTERPRISE HAS ENCOUNTERED A A HORRIBLE SPACE CREATURE. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WHOA! ♪♪ [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: REMEMBER, THIS IS THE MARCHING BAND. SO I DOUBT THEY HAD ANY IDEA WHAT THEY -- [ LAUGHTER ] TO THEM IT WAS THE ENTERPRISE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT COULD IT BE? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OF COURSE, ANOTHER BIG STORY IS THE POPE'S UPCOMING TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES. AND I SAW THAT TIME WARNER WILL OFFER A CHANNEL COMPLETELY DEDICATED TO HIS VISIT. WHICH IS FITTING WHEN YOU FIGURE TIME WARNER CUSTOMERS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO SAY, "JESUS CHRIST," AS MUCH AS THE POPE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "YES, I'LL HOLD! COME ON! REPRESENTATIVE!" [ APPLAUSE ] HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS. A NEW REPORT FOUND THAT THE U.S. ECONOMY CREATED 173,000 JOBS LAST MONTH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S GREAT. THE MOST COMMON JOB CREATED THIS SUMMER WAS TEACHER. THE SECOND-MOST COMMON, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] A LOT OF CANDIDATES RUNNING. THIS IS PRETTY INTERESTING HERE. ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, THE EARTH HAS THREE TRILLION TREES. WHICH IS ACTUALLY HALF OF WHAT IT HAD BEFORE HUMANS EXISTED. THE RESEARCHERS CAME UP WITH THAT NUMBER AFTER GETTING UP TO 50 TREES AND SAYING, OH, SCREW IT, THERE'S PROBABLY THREE TRILLION. I MEAN, NO ONE IS REALLY GONNA COUNT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ARE THEY GONNA TEST US ON THIS? I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN, THREE TRILLION? [ APPLAUSE ] OVER IN CANADA NOW, BUSINESSES HAVE STARTED TO LET CUSTOMERS CUT $20 BILLS IN HALF TO MAKE TWO $10 BILLS. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT, EVEN CANADA TREATS CANADIAN DOLLARS LIKE IT'S FAKE MONEY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S LIKE, "WE DON'T CARE, JUST CUT IT IN HALF IT'S TWO TENS. THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS." [ APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, I SAW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA -- HE'S REALLY FANTASTIC STUFF RIGHT NOW. HE GAVE A SPEECH AT THE LABOR DAY BREAKFAST IN BOSTON YESTERDAY. AND I THINK HIS SPEECH WRITERS MIGHT HAVE TAKEN LABOR DAY OFF, I THINK. HE'S STARTING TO CRACK. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
THOSE HARD-WORKING FOLKS WHO DEMANDED NOT SIMPLY A BIGGER PAYCHECK FOR THEMSELVES, BUT MORE -- [ COUGHING ] -- SECURITY FOR THE FOLKS WORKING NEXT TO THEM, TOO. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU'VE GOT MASSACHUSETTS AFL-CIO PRESIDENT STEVE TOMLIN -- TOLMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU LOOK UP AT THE SKY, PROSPERITY WILL COME RAINING DOWN ON US FROM THE TOP OF THE -- WHATEVER HIGH-RISE IS IN YOUR CITY. [ LAUGHTER ] -- I'M SO GLAD I'M NOT ON THE BALLOT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S A GREAT LINE. [ LAUGHTER ] OBAMA IS LIKE ONE WEEK AWAY FROM GIVING SPEECHES WITH A A MARGARITA IN HIS HAND. HE'S LIKE, "I DON'T CARE." WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW! GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, EVERYBODY! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. YEAH. HELLO, YEAH. RALPH LAUREN, PLEASE.
THAT'S FINE.
Jimmy: HOW CUTE. AND SHE LOVES IT AND GETS IT?
YEAH, AND SHE JUST WANTS TO GO FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER. AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO KEEP IT AT A TROT. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT'S LEGAL FOR A 3-YEAR-OLD. BUT --
Jimmy: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE NO IDEA. I DON'T KNOW --
BUT SHE IS WEARING HER -- SHE'S WEARING HER FIRST HEELS, WHICH IS VERY IMPRESSIVE. SHE'S LIKE, LIKE MAMA.
Jimmy: HILARIOUS. I SAW THIS PICTURE OF YOU --
I WON'T GET ON A HORSE.
Jimmy: YOU WON'T.
NO, I HAVE A HUGE FEAR.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH. I KNOW, I'M FROM TEXAS AND EVERYONE THINKS I RIDE A HORSE, BUT I DON'T. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DON'T. I WANT TO BE AT ONE WITH A A HORSE. WHEN I SEE A HORSE, I STROKE ITS HAIR AND I GO, WE'RE COOL.
OH, THAT'S GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RIDING. THEN I SEE PICTURES OF YOU LIKE THIS.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: DARE DEVILING AROUND.
I LOVE JET SKIING.
Jimmy: NO, THAT WOULD FRIGHTEN ME THEN. THAT'S SCARIER THAN THE HORSE.
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN, SO THAT FRIGHTENS ME. I'M COMPLETELY AFRAID OF SHARKS. SO APPARENTLY I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH ANIMALS LATELY.
Jimmy: AFRAID OF ALL ANIMALS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, NO.
PRETTY MUCH. BUT I CAN OWN A JET SKI.
Jimmy: REALLY?
OH, YEAH. I CAN THROW ANYONE OFF. THAT'S MY GOAL.
Jimmy: SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S NOT FUN TO LAUGH --
I'M GOING AROUND IN A CIRCLE TO GET MY HUSBAND. I THREW HIM OFF.
Jimmy: YOU'VE ALREADY THROWN HIM OFF.
YES.
Jimmy: BUT THEN I'VE GOT A A PICTURE OF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND, RIGHT? LOOK AT THIS PICTURE OF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND ON THE JET SKI. LOOK CLOSER TO THE FEET. YOU'RE WEARING HEELS.
YES.
Jimmy: YOU ACTUALLY ARE WEARING HEELS ON A JET SKI.
I AM ACTUALLY WEARING HEELS. I NEVER TAKE OFF A HEEL. YOU KNOW, I GET MORE GRIP WITH THEM. I JUST --
Jimmy: WHAT IS GOING ON? YOU CAN'T JET SKI AROUND WITH YOUR HEELS.
I MEAN, WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR OWN BRAND, WHY NOT?
Jimmy: I GUESS, YEAH. I DON'T HAVE JIMMY FALLON SNEAKERS OR ELSE --
YOU SHOULD.
Jimmy: I WOULD WEAR THEM ALL THE TIME.
YOU SHOULD.
Jimmy: CONGRATS ON -- THIS IS TEN YEARS INTO THIS. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. SO NOW IT'S -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I'M IN SHOCK.
Jimmy: PEOPLE LOVE IT, CLEARLY.
