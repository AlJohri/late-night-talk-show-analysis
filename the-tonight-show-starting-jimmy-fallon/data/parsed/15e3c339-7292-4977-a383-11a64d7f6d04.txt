THANK YOU, BUDDY, AND SO DO YOU.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, MY MAN.
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT MY SURPRISE IS GOING TO BE TONIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T HAVE ONE FOR YOU.
WHO HAVEN'T I SEEN IN A A WHILE? I CANNOT WAIT. THANKS, JIMMY.
Jimmy: YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME IN A WHILE, SO THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S A BIG SURPRISE, YEAH.
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
Jimmy: KEVIN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: OH, GOOD, YEAH. I'M SORRY. DO YOU HAVE NAIL POLISH ON?
OH, YEAH. I DO HAVE BLACK NAIL POLISH? YEAH, I DO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WOW. WHAT IS THAT? WHAT'S GOING ON?
WELL, IT'S -- IT KIND OF STEMS FROM AN ACCIDENT. I WAS -- I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED. I WAS HANGING A PICTURE, AND I WAS USING A HAMMER. AND I HIT MY NAIL, MY THUMB.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
AND IT GOT REALLY BLACK AND BLUE. IT WAS REALLY UGLY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT REALLY STOOD OUT FROM ALL THE OTHER ONES, SO I WANTED THEM ALL TO BLEND TOGETHER. [ LAUGHTER ] SO -- SO I TOOK THE HAMMER, AND I SLAMMED ALL THE OTHER ONES.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. WHY ARE YOU GONNA -- [ LAUGHTER ] NO, YOU COULD HAVE JUST GOTTEN NAIL POLISH OR SOMETHING.
WHO'S THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE NOW, JIMMY? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S THE MOVE RIGHT THERE.
NO, NO, NO. THE TRUTH IS I TAGGED ALONG WITH MY WIFE, SHE WENT TO GET A A MANI/PEDI.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I GOT BORED, SO I THOUGHT, "I'LL GET A MANI AT LEAST."
Jimmy: SURE.
AND, I SAT IN THE CHAIR. SHE GOES, "YOU SHOULD PAINT YOUR NAILS BLACK." BECAUSE SHE LIKES THE AGING ROCKER LOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I WENT AHEAD, AND I GOT IT DONE. I'M GLAD I DIDN'T TAG ALONG WHEN SHE WAS GETTING A WAXING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO WAY, EXACTLY. NO.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
Jimmy: YOU ARE -- YOU WERE -- YOU WERE A MALL SANTA AT ONE POINT?
I WAS A MALL SANTA.
Jimmy: WAS THAT TRUE?
THAT IS A TRUE STORY.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH. IN MY EARLY 20s, I MOVED TO SAN DIEGO.
Jimmy: MM-HMM.
AND MY BUDDY AND I GOT JOBS AS TEMPORARY SANTA CLAUSES, AND I WORKED AT THE SEARS DEPARTMENT STORE THERE.
Jimmy: NOT BAD.
BUT I LOOKED LIKE A TERRIBLE SANTA. I WAS, YOU KNOW, I WAS EARLY 20s, AND I WAS SKINNY. AND I HAD THIS LOUSY SUIT ON AND BAD, LIKE, YOU KNOW, COTTON FOR A BEARD. AND BECAUSE IT WAS SAN DIEGO, WE HAD A LOT OF KIDS FROM TIJUANA WOULD COME OVER, AND THEY DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. AND THEY WERE TERRIFIED, AND A A LOT OF THEM WOULD PEE ON MY LAP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU JUST GOT TO GET USED TO THAT.
NO, YOU NEVER GET USED TO IT.
Jimmy: NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU NEVER GET USED TO IT.
Jimmy: THEY WOULD JUST PEE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
BECAUSE THE SANTA COMPANY KNEW THAT THAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING, THEY SCOTCH GUARDED ALL THE PANTS, SO THAT WHEN THE KIDS PEED, THE PEE WOULDN'T PENETRATE. IT WAS JUST BUBBLE UP AND FALL DOWN OFF, DOWN ON THE FLOOR.
Jimmy: HOW CHARMING?
IT WAS VERY CHARMING.
Jimmy: THAT'S CHARMING FOR THE HOLIDAYS. YEAH.
Jimmy: KEVIN, I WANT TO SAY YOU LOOK GREAT, AND I THINK THAT --
DO YOU WANT TO SAY IT, OR YOU'RE GOING TO SAY IT? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT JIMMY? I DO FEEL GREAT, AND I'M GOING TO SAY THAT YOU LOOK GREAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
AND YOU FEEL GREAT.
Jimmy: I FEEL GREAT. BUT HOW DO YOU DO IT? DO YOU WORK OUT? HOW DO YOU STAY HEALTHY?
WELL, THANK YOU FOR ASKING, JIMMY. [ LAUGHTER ] I -- I EAT HEALTHY. I'M MOSTLY A VEGETARIAN. I WILL EAT FISH, BUT IT HAS TO BE SPECIFIC FISH. I LIKE SALMON ONCE IN A WHILE BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD FOR YOUR MEMORY. BUT WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU IS YOU ONLY REMEMBER WHAT THAT FISH REMEMBERED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT'S SWIMMING UP THE RAPIDS, HAVING SEX WITH A LOT OF OTHER FISH, AND THEN GETTING PULLED OUT OF THE WATER. AND I WILL ONLY EAT, LIKE I SAID, SPECIFIC FISH. IT'S GOT TO BE CAUGHT BY A A BROWN BEAR, SO BEAR-CAUGHT FISH ONLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S GREAT ADVICE.
GRIZZLY BROWN BEAR FROM MONTANA.
Jimmy: BEARS GOT TO BE FROM --
FROM MONTANA.
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
THE HARDEST PART IS GETTING THE FISH OUT OF THE BEAR'S MOUTH.
Jimmy: OH, YOU WERE THERE?
OH, OF COURSE. I HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S FROM THE BEAR'S MOUTH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY.
SO WHAT I DO IS I TICKLE THE BEAR UNDER HERE AND THE BEAR LAUGHS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
AND HE LETS GO OF THE FISH. I TAKE IT HOME. I HAVE TO HAVE IT PREPARED BY A A TIBETAN MONK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: KEVIN, THIS IS HARD FOR ME TO DO ALL THIS.
FROM MONTANA.
Jimmy: WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS DURING THE COMMERCIAL BREAK.
OKAY.
