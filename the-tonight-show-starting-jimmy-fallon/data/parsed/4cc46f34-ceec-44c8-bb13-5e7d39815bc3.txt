YEAH, THAT'S WHERE WE HANG OUT.
Jimmy: HANG OUT AT LINCOLN CENTER, YEAH. BUT WE WERE AT SOME EVENT AND YOU TOLD ME ABOUT "SHUFFLE ALONG."
YEAH.
Jimmy: I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
ME TOO. IT'S BASICALLY -- THERE WAS A A MUSICAL THAT WAS ON BROADWAY IN 1921. AND IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSICALS TO BE PRODUCED, DIRECTED, AND STARRING AND WRITTEN BY AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND IT LITERALLY CHANGED SORT OF, YOU KNOW, HISTORY. AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN WERE ALLOWED AS FAR AS, LIKE, THE FIFTH ROW FROM THE FRONT. THE ORCHESTRA, THE THEATER WAS INTEGRATED. IT'S WHY 63rd STREET IS A A ONE-WAY STREET NOW, BECAUSE TRAFFIC WAS SO BIG COMING UP TO SEE THE SHOW, THAT COPS HAD TO MOVE IT TO MAKING IT A ONE-WAY STREET.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
THE FIRST TIME JAZZ WAS USED IN A MUSICAL AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT THERE WAS A REAL LOVE SCENE BETWEEN AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN AND A A WOMAN. BEFORE IT REALLY WASN'T ALLOWED. SO, THEY WERE AFRAID THE AUDIENCE WAS GONNA RIOT, 'CAUSE IT REALLY WASN'T ALLOWED. FIRST TIME THAT HAPPENED AND THEN HISTORY KIND OF FORGOT ABOUT IT. AND SO GEORGE WOLFE HAS PUT TOGETHER THIS AMAZING, WHICH NOT ONLY IS THE ACTUAL SHOW, BUT ALSO WHAT HAPPENED BACKSTAGE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE YEARS AFTER "SHUFFLE ALONG" FIRST HIT BROADWAY.
Jimmy: SO, FUN.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT DOING IT.
Jimmy: AND CHOREOGRAPHED BY --
SAVION GLOVER.
Jimmy: SAVION GLOVER. I MEAN, OH, MY -- HOW'S YOUR TAP DANCING?
OH, WELL -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I CAN SING!
MY TAP DANCING, I, YOU KNOW, I'M LEARNING ON A DAILY BASIS. I CAN MAKE SOUNDS. NO, IT'S GONNA BE FINE.
Jimmy: I CAN MAKE SOUNDS. THAT'S IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M PRACTICING ALL THE TIME. I PRACTICE IN MY HOUSE. I'M DRIVING MY FAMILY CRAZY. I'M DRIVING THE POOR DOGS CRAZY, 'CAUSE I TAP UPSTAIRS AND THEY ALWAYS THINK SOMEONE'S, YOU KNOW, KNOCKING ON A DOOR. AND THEY'RE LIKE -- IT'S JUST ME TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. AND SAVION'S AMAZE -- YOU KNOW, THE WORLDS GREATEST TAP DANCER. AND WORKING WITH HIM, HE'S SO PATIENT. BUT THIS IS HOW HE TEACHES YOU A STEP. HE'LL SAY, OKAY, YOU GO, AH, AH-AH-DU, AND THEN HE JUST KIND OF DOES THE STEPS AND THEN YOU KIND OF GO -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EASY TO DO IT WITH YOUR MOUTH, YEAH.
RIGHT. AND THEN HE GOES, HUH-UH.
Jimmy: HE GOES, HUH-UH, YEAH.
