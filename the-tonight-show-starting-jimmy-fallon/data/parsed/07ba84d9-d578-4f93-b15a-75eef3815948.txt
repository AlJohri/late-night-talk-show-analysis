DURING A VERY FORCEFUL SPEECH LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.S. WILL LEAD A HUGE MULTINATIONAL COALITION TO FIGHT THE TERROR GROUPS IN IRAQ.

Jimmy: YEAH, I THINK HE SHOULD FOLLOW THE LAW IN ALL INSTANCES. YEAH. THEN HE SAID TO CONGRESS, "YOU FIRST." VERY INTERESTING. VERY, VERY INTERESTING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AS MUCH AS WE CAN. I THOUGHT THIS WAS PRETTY INTERESTING. A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT MILLENNIALS, WHICH ARE PEOPLE IN THEIR 20s AND 30s, ACTUALLY READ MORE BOOKS THAN OLDER GENERATIONS. [ CHEERS ] YEAH.

YEAH, MY DAUGHTER, EEVEE, WENT TO THE SET -- SEVEN. SHE WENT TO THE SET, AND WE HAD SORT OF A VERY CRUCIAL MOMENT TOGETHER. I PLAY MAURA, AND I HAD TO GO AND GET MY NAILS DONE. AND SO I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE MANI/PEDIS TOGETHER. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] REALLY. AND I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO HER BEFORE WE WENT TO THE SET. AND I WENT, "UM, DADDY'S GONNA -- UM." YOU KNOW IT IS. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT THIS IS DONE CORRECTLY. I MEAN, I WAS THROW UP NERVOUS ABOUT DOING THIS. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT'S DONE WELL. AND NOT ABOUT BEING GOOD OR FAMOUS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, BUT JUST DOING THE SUBJECT RIGHT. AND SO I SAID TO HER, "UH UH." AND SHE GOES, "DADDY." I SHOWED HER PICTURES AND SHE SAID, "OH, SHE'S JUST MORE COMFORTABLE BEING A WOMAN." [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Jimmy: THAT'S EXACTLY IT.
FROM THE MOUTH OF BABES, RIGHT?
