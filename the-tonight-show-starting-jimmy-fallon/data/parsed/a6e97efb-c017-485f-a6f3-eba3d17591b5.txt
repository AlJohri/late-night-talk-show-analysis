AND WE PLAYED A BIT OF DIALOGUE. AND NO ONE HAD ANY PLANS FOR IT OR ANYTHING. AND THEN, IT GOT SORT OF SINGLED OUT AS A MEMORABLE MOMENT. AND THEN, AS TIME WENT ON, IT GOT MORE MEMORABLE AND THE REST OF IT GOT LESS MEMORABLE. AND NOW, 20 YEARS LATER, IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT HAPPENED.

Jimmy: I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT -- THE TOWN.
WELL, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE DIFFERENT THEATERS OF THE WAR FOR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. BUT BRITAIN WAS THE PART OF THE FAR EAST THERE INVOLVED -- THIS WAS THE CAPTURE OF SINGAPORE BY THE JAPANESE IN 1942. SO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE ENSLAVED BY THE JAPANESE ARMY. AND FORCED TO BUILD A RAILWAY THROUGH BRUTAL CONDITIONS. YOU KNOW, IT WAS A JUNGLE. THEY WANTED TO BUILD IT ALL THE WAY FROM BASICALLY FROM THAILAND THROUGH TO BURMA THROUGH INDIA. AND MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE DIED IN THE PROCESS THROUGH STARVATION, TORTURE. REALLY, THE WORST CONDITIONS YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE.
Jimmy: IT'S HARD TO EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
NO. AND THIS GUY SURVIVED. BASCIALLY, AGAINST ALL THE ODDS. HE WAS ABOUT 20 AND HE SURVIVED UNIMAGINABLE TORTURE. AND THEN, LIKE MOST VETERANS OF THAT EXPERIENCE CAME HOME AND BOTTLED IT UP. DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT POST -- TRAMATIC --
POST DRAMATIC STRESS DISORDER. BACK THEN, THERE WASN'T A NAME FOR IT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THERAPISTS AVAILABLE.
Jimmy: GOSH.
AND HE'S, UNDERNEATH ALL THIS -- HE WAS HELL BENT ON VENGEANCE. HE WANTED TO FIND ONE OF THE GUYS WHO DID THIS, HOPE THEY ARE STILL ALIVE. AND GO AND KILL HIM. AND THIS WAS THE PLAN.

Jimmy: CHLOE, WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. NOW, YOU'RE DOING THIS PLAY, ARE YOU LIVING IN THE CITY NOW?
I AM. I'M LIVING IN THE CITY, JUST LIKE WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD.
Jimmy: YOU'RE BACK.
I'M BACK. I'M HERE.
Jimmy: DOING THE SAME THINGS YOU WERE WHEN YOU WERE SIX? HOPSCOTCH, STUFF LIKE THAT, GOING TO PARKS.
OH, YEAH, YEAH. RUNNING THROUGH THE PARK WITH MY SCOOTER, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: BUT DO YOU FEEL LIKE A NEW YORKER NOW?
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT. FOR SURE. I MEAN, I KIND OF GOT MY NEIGHBORHOOD HAUNTS NOW.
Jimmy: DO YOU KNOW HOW TO GET TO EVERYWHERE?
I DON'T UPTOWN AT ALL, BUT I'M PRETTY GOOD WITH DOWNTOWN NOW. I'M STILL TERRIFIED OF THE SUBWAY.
Jimmy: YOU ARE?
I'M TERRIFIED.
Jimmy: REALLY? BECAUSE -- WHY? IT'S MAGICAL TUBE MACHINE.
YES.
Jimmy: THE MAGIC SCARES YOU?
THE TIME MACHINE OF IT ALL REALLY, KIND OF, DID --
Jimmy: IT IS THE BEST WAY TO GET AROUND THOUGH.
NO, IT IS. IT'S QUICK, BUT I DON'T KNOW. I WOULDN'T TAKE IT ALONE.
Jimmy: NO? [ STUTTERS ] WHAT'S GOING ON? WHY WOULD YOU NOT -- NOW YOU'RE GETTING ME SCARED. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T TAKE IT ALONE BECAUSE THERE'S CREEPY PEOPLE.
MY MOM'S LIKE -- SHE'S PRETTY STRICT WITH THAT. SHE LIKE HAS MY UBER ACCOUNT ON MY PHONE. AND SHE'S LIKE, "YOU CAN TAKE AN UBER HERE AND THERE, BUT YOU HAVE TO TELL ME." BECAUSE SHE CAN TRACK WHERE I AM.
Jimmy: EVERYONE DOES UBER.
YEAH, YEAH. SHE CAN TRACK WHERE I AM, TOO. SHE CAN TRACK WHERE I'M PICKED UP AND DROPPED OFF, SO --
Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S A GPS THING. WE GOT TO LISTEN TO MOM.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: WHATEVER MOM SAYS IS RIGHT. BUT GET A GPS THING. AND THEN, ON THE SUBWAY, THROW IT IN ONE OF THOSE CREEPY PEOPLE -- HAVE MOM TRACK THAT GUY. LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT 'TIL FOUR IN THE MORNING?" YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
AT, LIKE, SOME RANDOM CLUB. YEAH, EXACTLY. SHE'S LIKE, "WHERE ARE YOU, CHLOE?"
Jimmy: NOW, I WAS LOOKING AT YOUR INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER AND ALL THAT STUFF. AND I FOLLOW YOU, AND I LIKE YOUR STUFF. YOU'RE A TWEETER. AND I SAW YOU POSTED A CUTE LITTLE PHOTO OF -- THIS IS YOU. AW, LOOK AT THIS. NOW, I LOVE YOUR EYEBROWS. ARE THEY DRAWN IN THERE?
OH, YEAH. MY BROTHERS USE BLACK EYE LINER.
Jimmy: DID THEY REALLY?
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE IN, LIKE, AN EYEBROW PEN OR WHATEVER.
Jimmy: YOUR BROTHERS WOULD DRESS YOU UP?
YEAH.
Jimmy: AW.
IT WASN'T HALLOWEEN OR ANYTHING SPECIAL LIKE THAT. NO.
Jimmy: OH, SO YOU JUST DRESSED LIKE SNOW WHITE?
YEAH, HE WOULD DRESS ME UP LIKE TREVOR. HE WOULD MAKE THESE HOME MOVIES IN OUR BACKYARD AND MAKE LIKE DOLLY SHOTS WITH FOUR WHEELERS.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
IT WAS WEIRD.
Jimmy: THAT'S FUN. HOW MANY BROTHERS DO YOU HAVE?
FOUR OLDER BROTHERS.
Jimmy: FOUR OLDER BROTHERS, SO --
LOTS OF BROTHERS.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE THE BABY?
I'M THE BABY AND THE ONLY GIRL.
Jimmy: SO THEY MAKE YOU JUST DO ALL THESE --
EVERYTHING. I'M BASICALLY THEIR HIRED FRIEND.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHEN THEY NEED ONE. IF THEY DON'T WANT ME, THOUGH, I'M NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.
Jimmy: NO, NO. THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU ALWAYS PLAY WITH YOUR BROTHERS. I HAVE ONE SISTER, AND I PLAY WITH HER. MY SISTER ALWAYS LIKED SCHOOL. THAT WAS HER FAVORITE GAME.
OH.
Jimmy: I KNOW.
OH OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY, GREAT.
Jimmy: "LET'S PLAY SCHOOL. LET'S PLAY SCHOOL." AND I'M LIKE, "UGH." AND THEN, WE PLAY SCHOOL AND THAT. WE'D JUST GET OUR THINGS READY, AND WE'D DO MATH PROBLEMS.
WHAT?
Jimmy: AND I'D BE LIKE, "RECESS." [ LAUGHTER ] SKIP TO RECESS.
RECESS!
Jimmy: THAT'S THE BEST PART OF SCHOOL.
LUNCH BREAK.
Jimmy: YEAH, LET'S GO TO LUNCH BREAK. BECAUSE I HAD A LITTLE -- I HAD SNACKS IN A LITTLE BAGGY. AND I WOULD PUT THEM IN MY THING, AND BE LIKE "LET'S GO TO RECESS."
THAT'S SO CUTE. DO YOU EAT YOUR LITTLE CHEEZ-ITS?
Jimmy: YEAH. YEAH, CHEEZ-ITS. YEAH, EXACTLY. EXACTLY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT -- SNACKS, I HAD THE WEIRDEST STUFF. MY MOM WOULD ALWAYS WRITE NOTES ON THE BANANAS.
AW.
Jimmy: AND IT WAS SO EMBARRASSING. I WOULD HAVE TO JUST PEEL IT REALLY QUICK. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, MAN, THAT'S COOL. YEAH, WHATEVER. JUST HANGING OUT. A SMILEY FACE FROM MY MOM. LIKE "HAVE A GREAT DAY!" AND OH, HOW EMBARRASSING.
IT'S JUST A BANANA.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST WHATEVER. I JUST GOT DONE FIGHTING SOMEONE, SO WHATEVER. WANT TO ARM WRESTLE? WHATEVER.
PUNCH YOURSELF IN THE BATHROOM, LIKE PUN AND GET BLACK EYE.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- LOOK, YOU'RE -- THIS IS IT. YOU'RE DOING A PLAY. IS THIS YOUR FIRST PLAY?
YEAH. WELL, IT'S MY FIRST TIME ON STAGE OR ANYTHING. I DIDN'T DO SCHOOL PLAYS OR ANYTHING SO --
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS BIG TIME THOUGH.
YEAH. I MEAN, STEVEN SODERBERGH IS DIRECTING IT, AND SCOTT BURNS WROTE IT. SO IT'S REALLY INTERESTING. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S -- IT'S VERY THOUGHT-PROVOKING.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE OR GUN CONTROL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NO, IT'S PRETTY MUCH -- DO YOU KNOW THE GAME TELEPHONE THAT YOU PLAY AT CAMP? >
Jimmy: OF COURSE. I PLAY IT IN THE OFFICE.
YEAH, I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME. IT'S BASICALLY THAT BUT ON A A REALLY LARGE SCALE. IT'S BASED AROUND A SCHOOL SHOOTING, AND IT'S BASICALLY HOW ONE GIRL'S TRUTH CAN BE SO MANIPULATED AND SO -- IT BECOMES SO CONVOLUTED BY THE END OF IT. BY THE PRESS, BY VICTIMS' FAMILIES AND STUFF LIKE THAT THAT YOUR TRUTH BECOMES SOMEONE ELSE'S TRUTH. AND IT ALSO SHOWS YOU HOW PEOPLE TRY AND FIND REASON IN SO MANY THINGS. AND SOMETIMES THERE IS NO REASON BEHIND HORRIFIC TRAGEDIES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. SOMETIMES IT JUST IS CHANCE.
Jimmy: IS IT TOUGH TO DO A A PLAY LIKE THAT EVERY SINGLE NIGHT?
YEAH, IT'S REALLY HARD. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SHE FINDS OUT IN ONE OF THE FIRST SCENES THAT ONE OF HER BEST FRIENDS IS DEAD. AND IT'S REALLY HEAVY. BUT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I'VE SEEN A LOT OF TEENAGERS THAT HAVE COME TO SEE IT. AND IT REALLY AFFECTS THEM GREATLY. AGAIN, IT'S LIKE I WAS SAYING. IT'S REALLY THOUGHT-PROVOKING WITH THEM BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING SO MUCH, YOU KNOW? AND IT REALLY KIND OF HITS CLOSE TO HOME FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I DON'T KNOW, IT'S --
Jimmy: HOW LONG DOES IT GO? HOW LONG ARE YOU DOING IT FOR?
