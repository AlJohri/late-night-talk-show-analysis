AND I GET -- WE PULL UP AND LIKE OF COURSE YOU'RE AMPED. LIKE, SO EXCITED. AND I REALIZE I LEFT MY PURSE AT HOME WITH MY I.D. AND MY WALLET AND EVERYTHING. WHEN I GET OUT AND I GO UP TO THE DESK AND I'M -- I'M HYSTERICAL. LIKE I'M ON THE VERGE OF A A FULL-BLOWN MELTDOWN.
Jimmy: BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE, THIS IS GOING TO RUIN MY WHOLE NIGHT.
IT'S GOING TO RUIN MY WHOLE NIGHT. IT'S GOING TO RUIN MY FRIEND'S WHOLE NIGHT. LIKE I WAS FREAKING OUT. THEN I WAS LIKE I HAVE A A DIGITAL COPY OF MY PASSPORT AND MY I.D. AND THEY'RE LIKE "NO, NO, WE CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SORRY." I WAS LIKE, "IT'S MY BIRTHDAY PLEASE!"
Jimmy: DO YOU WANT TO CALL MY MOM?
I KNOW.
Jimmy: SO WOULD THAT HELP?
SOMEONE HAD TO BRING IT -- SOMEONE HAD TO BRING IT DOWN.
Jimmy: GO BACK AND GET YOUR -- SOMEBODY HAS TO COME BACK AND GET IT.
YES. BUT I GOT IN AND IT WAS ALL GOOD.
Jimmy: DID YOU GET ANY GOOD PRESENTS?
I DID. I GOT TO -- THE TRIP. THE FACT THAT ALL MY FRIENDS WANTED TO SPEND TWO NIGHTS IN ATLANTIC CITY TO CELEBRATE MY BIRTHDAY WAS A PRESENT.
Jimmy: YEAH. I WANT TO GO GAMBLING WITH YOU, ONCE. BECAUSE I HAVEN'T -- I DON'T GAMBLE EITHER. BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE FUN IF ME AND YOU WENT AND GAMBLED TO SEE WHO CAME OUT ON TOP.
YEAH. I THINK ANYBODY WOULD COME OUT MORE ON TOP.
Jimmy: YEAH. I'M BAD. THOUGH I'M REALLY BAD. I HAVEN'T GAMBLED IN SO LONG. WE HAD JENNIFER LOPEZ ON THE SHOW YESTERDAY, OR TWO DAYS AGO? YESTERDAY I THINK. I FORGET. BUT WE JUST HAD HER ON AND I WAS TALKING TO HER AND SHE BROUGHT HER MOM. AND THAT THIS WAS -- IT WAS A A LONG AND BORING STORY, BUT I'LL TELL IT, ANYWAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I WENT TO ATLANTIC CITY AND I'M AT THE BORGATA, I WANT TO SAY. IS THAT WHERE YOU WENT?
THAT'S WHERE I WAS. BORGATA.
Jimmy: SO WE JUST -- I WAS DOING THE SLOT MACHINES WITH MY DAD. AND I WOULD PUT THE COIN IN AND MY DAD WOULD PULL THE THING. AND WE'D DO "WHEEL OF FORTUNE" SLOT MACHINES. SO WE PUT THE DOLLAR IN, PULL THE --
TOTALLY. I'M FAMILIAR.
Jimmy: SO MY MOM -- WE DID IT FOR SO LONG MY MOM WAS LIKE, I'M GOING TO PLAY THIS. SO WE WERE JUST LIKE, WE'RE IN THE ZONE. WE DID IT AND LIKE THIS COLD MACHINE IT'S GOING TO HIT. IT'S GOING TO HIT. WE HIT FOR $500.
OH, MY GOD.
Jimmy: MAJOR, RIGHT?
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME? I WAS ON A SLOT AND I WAS SITTING THERE COLD, COLD, AND I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, I'M DONE." AND I LOOK BACK OVER AND A GUY HAS SLID HIS WAY OVER TO MY MACHINE.
Jimmy: WAS HE GONNA GRAB IT AS SOON YOU GET OFF?
YES. I WATCHED HIM DO THAT.
Jimmy: HE CAN'T DO THAT.
I WATCHED HIM DO THAT. AND I GOT REALLY MAD. I GOT REALLY MAD ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU WOULD. DUDE, COME ON. AT LEAST LET ME WALK AWAY.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS LIKE -- YEAH. I WAS RIGHT THERE.
Jimmy: SO -- BACK TO MY BORING STORY. I -- WE HIT FOR $500 AND WE'RE LIKE, "OOH OOH!" WE'RE LIKE, THIS IS THE BEST. WAIT UNTIL MOM HEARS THIS. WE'RE WINNERS, WE'RE THE COOLEST. I LOVE YOU, DAD. I LOVE YOU, SON, FOREVER, TOGETHER. WE'RE CONGA LINE DANCING TO OUR ROOMS. YOU KNOW I'M LIKE, SEE YOU TOMORROW. WE'RE GOING TO GO BREAKFAST ON US, AH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE GET UP. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THEY DELIVER A PAPER OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR IN THE HOTEL ROOM.
YEP.
Jimmy: SO I LOOK AT THE HEADLINE. I'M NOT KIDDING, IT SAYS J. LO'S MOM HITS SLOT MACHINES FOR $2.4 MILLION.
NO. OH MY GOD.
Jimmy: THE SAME MACHINE. THE SAME THING WE WERE PLAYING.
WOW!
Jimmy: YES! AND I FELT LIKE SUCH A LOSER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
MAYBE -- DO YOU THINK SHE SLID HER WAY OVER ON TO YOUR MACHINE?
Jimmy: SHE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN MY STOOL. YEAH. I HAVEN'T TALKED TO MY FATHER SINCE. ANYWAY THIS IS YOUR GOLDEN BIRTHDAY. I WANT TO GET YOU A PRESENT. SO WE GOT YOU A COOL, HOPEFULLY YOU LIKE THIS. IT WAS NUMBER 23.
OH MY GOD!
Jimmy: NUMBER 23. THAT'S YOURS.
THAT'S AMAZING! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE THAT.
Jimmy: YOU DO?
I COULD HAVE THIS HAD TO WEAR IN AC.
Jimmy: RIGHT? OKAY. WELL WHEN YOU GO BACK.
I'VE GOT TO BACK AND I'M GONNA WEAR IT.
Jimmy: DON'T FORGET TO BRING YOUR I.D.
OH MY GOD, I LOVE IT. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: OKAY, WE LOVE YOU. I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR MOVIE, "BRIMSTONE."
YEP.
Jimmy: NOW IT'S GUY PIERCE?
YES.
Jimmy: I LOVE GUY PIERCE.
I KNOW. HE'S REALLY AMAZING.
Jimmy: THAT'S MY GUY. HE'S THE FUNNIEST GUY EVER.
HE'S REALLY GOOD.
Jimmy: BUT, HE DOESN'T PLAY FUNNY IN THIS MOVIE?
HE DOES NOT. NO, HE PLAYS A VERY MYSTERIOUS, HAUNTING CHARACTER IN THIS FILM.
Jimmy: WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THIS?
WELL I KEEP -- I WAS DOING INTERVIEWS NEXT TO THE DIRECTOR AT THE VENICE FILM FESTIVAL. AND WE HAD SORT OF THIS DIVIDER BETWEEN US, AND I SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE FILM. AND I JUST HEAR HIM GO, "NO, NO, DON'T DAKOTA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT?" AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, SORRY. OKAY."
Jimmy: SPOILER ALERT. SPOILER ALERT.
YEAH, I WAS LIKE, "NO. I DIDN'T KNOW." SO NOW I'M TERRIFIED TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: I MEAN YOU HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
NO, NO. SO I PLAY -- I PLAY -- IT'S KIND OF A WESTERN. SO I PLAY A WOMAN IN THE FRONTIER AND I'M MUTE IN THE FILM AND GUY PIERCE'S CHARACTER IS A REVEREND AND HE SORT OF MYSTERIOUSLY COMES BACK INTO MY LIFE AND THE FILM KIND OF IS ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP. PAST AND PRESENT.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP. HERE'S DAKOTA FANNING AND GUY PIERCE IN "BRIMSTONE." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
