WELCOME, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AT HOME. HERE WE ARE. YOU MADE IT. NEW YORK CITY, YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW." WELCOME TO THE SHOW. I'M JIMMY FALLON AND IF JUST ONE MORE OF LeBRON'S TEAMMATES GETS HURT, I'M THE NEW POWER FORWARD FOR THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MAN, WHAT A GAME LAST NIGHT. THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS BEAT THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS TO TAKE A 2-1 LEAD IN THE NBA FINALS. YEP. NEXT TIME YOU'LL SEE SOMEONE FIGHTING THIS HARD FOR OHIO WON'T BE UNTIL NEXT YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. [ LAUGHTER ] IN ADDITION TO 40 POINTS FROM LeBRON JAMES, THE CAVS GOT ANOTHER BIG GAME FROM GUARD MATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA, WHO HAD 20. AND DELLAVEDOVA PULLED OF HIS MASK AND WAS LIKE, "PSYCH. I'M STILL LeBRON." [ LAUGHTER ] WE KNEW THAT. SOME NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON. YESTERDAY THE SECRET SERVICE EVACUATED JOURNALISTS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE PRESSROOM DURING A A SECURITY SCARE, BUT NOT PRESIDENT OBAMA. [ LAUGHTER ] IT GOT WORSE. AND THEY SAID, "WE FORGOT SOMEONE." AND RAN BACK TO GET THEIR STRIPPER. CINNAMON IS SAFE. CINNAMON IS SAFE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CINNAMON IS FINE. OH, A BIT OF A SCANDAL HERE. THIS WEEK A PICTURE WAS POSTED THAT SHOWS PRESIDENT OBAMA ON A A BALCONY WITH THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER HOLDING WHAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE A PACK OF CIGARETTES. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] OBAMA WOULD TELL MICHELLE THEY WERE JUST CANDY CIGARETTES, BUT ACTUALLY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY GET HIM IN MORE TROUBLE. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE CANDY. THEY'RE KALE? THEY'RE KALE CIGARETTES? [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S THE LATEST ON THE ELECTION.

[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LISTEN TO THIS, IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, BERNIE SANDERS SAID THAT HE'D LIKE TO SEE MORE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, INCLUDING SOME THAT INVOLVE MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES SO THEY CAN, "HONESTLY CONFRONT EACH OTHER ON THE ISSUES." IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GETTING HIS WAY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY SCHEDULING SEVERAL ONE-ON-ONE DEBATES BETWEEN CANDIDATES ON VERY SPECIFIC TOPICS.

[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GUYS, I HEARD ABOUT A RANCH IN COLORADO THAT OFFERS CANA CAMP, WHICH IS A MARIJUANA INSPIRED RESORT THAT ALLOWS GUESTS TO SMOKE EVERYWHERE ON THE 170 ACRES. YEAH, YOU CAN TELL IT'S A WEED CAMP BECAUSE INSTEAD OF TELLING SCARY GHOST STORIES THEY JUST TELL JOB INTERVIEW STORIES. YOU EVER HEAR ABOUT THE TIME I HAD TO WAKE UP BEFORE NOON? [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THOSE TWO PRISONERS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK WHO BROKE OUT OF JAIL USING POWER TOOLS. YOU SEE THAT?

Jimmy: IS HE LEARNING TO DRIVE?
THE DRIVING. YEAH, HE'S STARTING TO. I MEAN, EVERYBODY IS A LITTLE AFRAID TO LET HIM GET BEHIND THE WHEEL, IT SEEMS.

Jimmy: YOU CAN'T DRIVE UP ON THE SIDEWALK.
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN --
Jimmy: HITTING THESE DOGS AND PEOPLE. YEAH.

Jimmy: STICK SHIFT IS TOUGH.
STICK SHIFT IS TOUGH, BUT I FIGURED YOU KNOW LETS -- GET HIM GOING ON THAT AND HE'LL BE ABLE TO HANDLE --

THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S A SMALL GROUP OF HACKERS THAT ARE WORKING IN A SOCIETY CALLED 'F' SOCIETY. IT'S A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO TAKE DOWN THIS HUGE CONGLOMERATE. JUST BRING THEM TO THEIR KNEES AND RESTORE FINANCIAL BALANCE TO THE PEOPLE.
