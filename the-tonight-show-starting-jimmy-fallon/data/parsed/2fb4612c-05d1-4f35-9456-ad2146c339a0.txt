Jimmy: YEAH. NEXT THING I KNOW, I'LL GO TO DISNEY WORLD NEXT. THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO. I'LL GO TO THE WARM WEATHER.
I JUST CAME FROM THERE.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T LIKE DISNEY WORLD?
I LOVE DISNEY WORLD. BUT WHEN YOU GET IN DISNEY WORLD, YOU DISCOVER HOW UNFAMOUS YOU REALLY ARE. WHEN THAT MOUSE WALKS OUT, HE'S KING, BABY.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU'RE NOTHING.
NO TALENT. HE HAS NO TALENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
HE CAN'T SING. HE AIN'T GOT NO JOKES, HE AIN'T GOT NO FOUR FINGERS. I'M SITTING THERE LOOKING AT HIM. I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE FLAWS. HIS FEET DON'T BEND WHEN HE WALK. HE'S FLAT-FOOTED. BUT HE IS THE MAN. I JUST STAND NEXT TO MICKEY MOUSE, THEY DON'T KNOW YOU THERE.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T, YEAH.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO GO BECAUSE YOU JUST HAD A KID.
Jimmy: YEAH.
GETS OLD ENOUGH, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IS NOT WHAT IT'S CRANKED UP TO BE, THE CHARACTER BREAKFAST. SEE --
Jimmy: THAT'S AMAZING. THAT'S WHERE YOU GO --
SEE KIDS, THEY SEE THESE CHARACTERS ON TV AND IT'S 4, 6 INCHES TALL. TIGGER CAME UP BEHIND THIS LITTLE BOY EATING BREAKFAST AND TOUCHED HIM WITH HIS PAW, AND HIS THE MOTHER THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT MOMENT SO SHE PULLED THE CAMERA OUT. THAT LITTLE BOY TURNED AROUND AND SAW TIGGER WAS 6 FEET TALL -- AAHH! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE MOST FRIGHTENING THING EVER.
IT SCARED TIGGER. THE DUDE IN THE SUIT SAID, OH [ BLEEP ].
Jimmy: THAT'S HIS CATCH PHRASE, ISN'T IT? THAT'S HIS CATCH PHRASE. THAT'S TIGGER'S CATCH PHRASE RIGHT THERE. NO, OH, THAT'S HILARIOUS.
I LOVED IT, MAN.
Jimmy: I'VE GOT TO SAY I LOVE, TOO, "FAMILY FUED," BUT YOU DID A CELEBRITY VERSION OF "FAMILY FUED" AND YOU HAD HONEY BOO BOO'S FAMILY ON THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST -- EXPLAIN IT TO ME. EXPLAIN IT TO ME.
YOU DON'T. YOU DON'T -- YOU DON'T KNOW NOBODY LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T.
Jimmy: IT WAS AMAZING TELEVISION.
SERIOUSLY, MAN, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE SHOW STARTED. OKAY, I GOT A MONITOR IN MY DRESSING ROOM. AND WE'RE 40 MINUTES DELAYED, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING. BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO TAPE SIX OF THESE SHOWS IN A DAY. AND SHE DONE SAT DOWN ON THE CORNER OF THE REHEARSAL OF THE STAGE AND SHE WON'T DO ANYTHING. SO I GO OUT THERE AND SAY WHAT'S GOING ON? SHE SAT DOWN AND SAID, I CAME -- THE ONE NAMED PUMPKIN.
Jimmy: THAT'S MY FAVORITE, PUMPKIN.
SHE YOUR FAVORITE.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
PUMPKIN SHUT THE SHOW DOWN BECAUSE SHE HAD A REQUEST. "I CAN'T DO ANY MORE UNTIL I GET A BOWL OF CORN." [ LAUGHTER ] WHO THE HELL CAN'T GO ON WITHOUT A BOWL OF CORN? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S ALMOST LIKE POPEYE, ALMOST.
I GOT IT IF YOU NEED A SHOT OF HENNESY. [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT IT IF YOU NEED YOUR FAVORITE RECREATIONAL DRUG TO CONTINUE THE SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT WHO THE HELL NEEDS A A BOWL OF CORN? AND IT'S THREW THE PRODUCERS INTO SOMETHING, BECAUSE -- WHERE DO YOU GET A DAMN BOWL OF CORN? I WAS OUT THERE ON THE FLOOR, MAN. I WAS GOING, THIS IS CRAZY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I CAN'T GO ON UNLESS I GET A A BOWL OF CORN. CORN.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE JOLLY GREEN GIANT. ABSOLUTELY. YOU GUYS, STEVE HARVEY, THE EXPANDED EDITION OF "ACT LIKE A A LADY, THINK LIKE A MAN" IS ON PRE-SALE NOW AT AMAZON.COM.
