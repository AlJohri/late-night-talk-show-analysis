Jimmy: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
HI.
Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I APPRECIATE IT.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: OH, PLEASE. I KNOW YOU. I KNOW YOU AS A HOST. BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW YOUR WORK AS MUCH UNTIL I SAW YOU FOR THE FIRST REPUBLICAN DEBATE. YOU WERE FANTASTIC ON THAT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I GOTTA SAY YOU DID A A GREAT JOB WITH THAT. I WAS LIKE, "OH, THIS IS FANTASTIC. THIS HAS GOT TO BE --" FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE LIKE, "OH, WHO IS THIS PERSON? SHE'S PHENOMENAL." DID YOUR LIFE CHANGE DRAMATICALLY AFTER THAT OR NOT REALLY?
WELL, SO, DONALD TRUMP DID NOT FEEL THE SAME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, NO, NO. HE DID NOT, NO. HE DID AGREE WITH THAT.
IT CHANGED A LITTLE.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
I CAN NO LONGER GO ON TWITTER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. THEY CAN GET HARSH ON THAT TWITTER, THE SOCIAL MEDIA.
YEAH, IT'S BEEN SORT OF A A SURREAL SIX MONTHS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE NEVER ANTICIPATED THAT ANYBODY WOULD REACT TO THE QUESTIONS IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY. BUT YOU KNOW, YOU SORT OF KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN AND SHOULDERS BACK AND TRY TO FORGE FORWARD.
Jimmy: BUT THAT WAS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE THAT UNFAIR. ARE YOU BIASED AGAINST -- DID YOU ASK HIM THE TOUGHER QUESTIONS, DONALD TRUMP?
HE HAD A TOUGH QUESTION, BUT THEY ALL GOT TOUGH QUESTIONS. I MEAN, THE OPENING ROUND OF THE FIRST DEBATE IN PARTICULAR WAS ALL ABOUT ELECTABILITY. SO WE WERE TRYING TO "WHAT'S YOUR WEAK SPOT? WHAT'S GOING TO PRESENT YOU FROM GETTING THE NOMINATION? WHAT'S GOING TO PREVENT YOU FROM WINNING AGAINST HILLARY, WHO'S GONNA BE THE LIKELY DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE?" AND, THAT'S WHERE I WAS GOING FROM HIM. BUT, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THOSE GUYS KIND OF GOT IT RIGHT IN THE KISSER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT, YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: BUT, THAT'S YOUR JOB AS A MODERATOR? IS THAT --
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. I MEAN, THEY WANT GEORGE WASHINGTON'S JOB. SO, I'M A MEMBER OF THE PRESS, AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PRESS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SEE IF THEY'RE WORTHY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU DO THAT. AND THEN THE NEXT DAY, THE WHOLE THING AND TRUMP WAS TWEETING AND THINGS, AND IT JUST GOT OUT OF CONTROL.
I HEARD, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU HANDLED IT VERY WELL BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND, HERE COMES THE NEXT GOP DEBATE. WELL, THIS IS PROBABLY, WHAT? THE SEVENTH GOP DEBATE WAS LAST WEEK BACK ON FOX, AND THEY ANNOUNCED THAT YOU'RE MODERATING, ONE OF THE MODERATORS AGAIN, AND DONALD TRUMP GOES, "I'M OUT." AND YOU GO, "WAIT, WHAT?" AND HE GOES, "YEAH, I'M OUT OF THIS. IF MEGYN KELLY IS INVOLVED, I DON'T -- NO."
WELL, HE SAID IT WAS ABOUT ME, AND THEN HE SAID IT WAS ABOUT A STATEMENT MY BOSS PUT OUT. AND THEN, HE SAID IT WAS ABOUT, LIKE, A GUM WRAPPER ON THE FLOOR. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE WERE A LOT OF REASONS THAT HE GAVE, BUT I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY HE DIDN'T SHOW UP.
Jimmy: REALLY?
BUT HE DID NOT SHOW UP IN THE END.
Jimmy: DID HE NOT HAVE ANY IDEA THAT YOU WOULD BE INVOLVED?
HE KNEW. FOX ANNOUNCED IT BACK IN AUGUST. AND THE, THEY RE-ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE ACTUAL WEEK OF THE DEBATE THAT I THINK IT REALLY DAWNED ON HIM THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO AGAIN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND ONCE AGAIN, ALL OF THOSE GUYS HAD TOUGH QUESTIONS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU GOT TO WIND UP AND DO IT. THAT'S WHAT THEY PAY ME TO DO.
Jimmy: DID YOU THINK HE WAS GOING TO SHOW UP LAST-MINUTE AND GO LIKE -- [ AS TRUMP ] "SURPRISE!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "FORGOT ABOUT SOMEBODY? GUESS WHAT? I WAS HIDING BEHIND A WALL, A A GIANT WALL. I'VE BEEN HERE THE WHOLE TIME!" [ LAUGHTER ] WERE YOU PREPARED IF HE DID SHOW UP?
YES. AND SO RIGHT -- THERE WAS A A REPORTER THAT CAME OUT LATE THAT DAY OF THE DEBATE. THE DEBATE WAS ON THURSDAY. IT WAS LIKE 2:30, 3:30 IN THE AFTERNOON, SAYING HE'S COMING. SO, WE HAD JUST PULLED ALL OF OUR TRUMP QUESTIONS OUT OF OUR DEBATE FILES. AND WE PUT THEM ALL BACK IN. SO WE HAD -- WHEN WE WENT OUT THERE, ONE BIG TRUMP PILE AND ONE BIG NON-TRUMP PILE.
Jimmy: YOU DID IT VERY INTERESTING. "TRUMP PILE." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DID A THING THAT YOU'RE GETTING GOOD REVIEWS ON. YOU DID VIDEO CLIPS OF THEMSELVES, AND KIND OF PROVING JUST -- KIND OF DEBATING THEMSELVES ALMOST. IT WAS GREAT.
I SAID TO MY CO-MODERATORS, I'M LIKE, "I WANT TO USE ACTUAL VIDEO." SOME OF THE GUYS WERE LIKE, "WHAT? WHOA!" I SAID, "WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME SAYING IT -- WHAT THEY SAID IN MY WORDS AND THEM SAYING IT IN THEIR WORDS? WE'RE A TELEVISION NETWORK. WE LIKE VISUAL AIDS. WHY NOT PUT THEMSELVES ON TV USING THEIR OWN WORDS?" AND I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A A DYNAMIC MOMENT OF THE DEBATE. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE CANDIDATES LOVED IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PROBABLY NOT THEIR FAVORITE THING.
BUT I THINK THE AUDIENCE APPRECIATED IT.
Jimmy: IT WAS SOMETHING. [ CHEERS ] IT WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND YOU GO -- IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE GOSSIPING. IT'S ALMOST LIKE, IT'S JUST SAYING THAT YOU EXPLAIN YOURSELF. THAT'S ALL.
IT'S SO MUCH DIFFERENT TO HEAR THEM IN THEIR OWN WORDS. YOU KNOW, SORT OF WALK US THROUGH THEIR HISTORY. AND IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO WEASEL OUT OF THE EARLIER POSITIONS WHEN THE AUDIENCE HAS JUST SEEN THEM SAY THE THING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT, EVEN IN THE FACE OF THAT. THEY TRY TO TELL ME THEY DIDN'T SAY THE THINGS THEY SAID. IT'S LIKE, "THEY JUST SAW IT!"
Jimmy: IT'S RIGHT THERE. IT'S ON VIDEO.
THE MAGIC OF VIDEO TAPES.
Jimmy: YEAH, SO MARCH 3rd, IS YOU HAVE ANOTHER DEBATE COMING UP. ALREADY, YOU'RE ANNOUNCED AS BEING ONE OF THE MODERATORS, IN DETROIT.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: GREAT CITY. AND YOU'LL TO BE THERE. DO WE KNOW IF DONALD TRUMP IS COMING TO THIS ONE?
HE HASN'T COMMITTED.
Jimmy: DO YOU THINK IT HURT HIM IN IOWA THAT HE DIDN'T --
I THINK HE THINKS IT HURT HIM.
Jimmy: YEAH.
HE SAID PUBLICLY HE THINKS -- THAT WAS BASICALLY HIS LAST JOB INTERVIEW WITH THE IOWANS, AND HE SKIPPED IT. I THINK HE REALIZED AFTER THE FACT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BENEFITTED HIM TO BE THERE. IF NOTHING ELSE, HE GAVE ALL OF THESE OTHER GUYS ALL THIS OXYGEN. WHEN TRUMP IS IN THE ROOM, HE GETS A LOT OF OXYGEN.
Jimmy: SURE.
THESE OTHER GUYS HAD A A CHANCE TO MAKE THEIR MARK. BUT, YOU KNOW, TRUMP -- SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, HE'S ELECTRIFIED THE REPUBLICAN BASE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING, "OH, HE'S DONE NOW." HE WAS A CLOSE SECOND IN IOWA. HE'S WAY AHEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND HE'S INTRODUCED A LOT OF ISSUES INTO THIS ELECTION THAT THE REPUBLICANS REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT. SO, DON'T COUNT HIM OUT.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS MARCH 3rd. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THE SHOW.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: FIRST OF MANY TIMES. CONGRATULATIONS ON EVERYTHING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
