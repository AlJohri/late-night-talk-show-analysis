IT SOUNDS LIKE A STUPID HOLLYWOOD STORY, RIGHT?
Jimmy: NO.
HE STOPS. I DID LIKE A LITTLE THREE MINUTE MONOLOGUE AND HE CALLED THE NEXT DAY AND SAID, "DO YOU WANT TO BE ON MY NEW TV SHOW?" I SAID, "NO." [ LAUGHTER ] NOT REALLY. I'M NOT AN ACTOR. HE SAYS, "OH, YES, YOU ARE. YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET."
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THEN YOU WENT ON "THE SOPRANOS."
WELL, I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO, SO I WENT DOWN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOTHING TO DO BUT BE STEVIE VAN ZANDT. EXACTLY, YEAH.
IT WORKED OUT GOOD.
Jimmy: IT WORKED OUT FANTASTIC. AND THEN, IT ALSO LED TO "LILYHAMMER," WHICH I THINK FANS OF "SOPRANOS," THEY MISSED THAT. WHEN THEY NEED THAT WISE GUY ENTERTAINMENT, THEY GO TO "LILYHAMMER" AND THANK GOD YOU DID THIS. AND YOU'RE KILLING IT. IT'S ON THE THIRD SEASON NOW.
YEAH, THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A REALLY GOOD ADVENTURE. IT WAS REALLY NETFLIX'S FIRST ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING BROADCAST. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S A REALLY CRAZY SHOW. WE STARTED WINNING ALL THESE AWARDS LAST YEAR. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE A SMALL CULT SHOW. WE'RE IN NORWAY, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT WE WON BEST COMEDY IN MONTE CARLO. WE WON BEST DRAMA IN NORWAY. WE STARTED WINNING ALL THESE THINGS.
Jimmy: AND THEN ALSO YOU'RE DOING THE SCORE AND ALL THIS STUFF. I MEAN, YOU'RE DOING ALL THE MUSIC AND ALL THAT STUFF.
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO FINALLY RELEASE IT. IT'S OUT -- IT'S OUT RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: WHAT IS ON THIS? WICKEDCOOLRECORDS.COM.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S LIKE 50 TRACKS OF THE SCORE I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF SEASONS. A COUPLE OF VOCALS ON THERE, YOU KNOW. MY CHARACTER LIKES TO SING IN HIS CLUB NOW AND THEN.
Jimmy: YEAH. ALSO, I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU, YOU DO "LILYHAMMER" AND YOU GOT BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN TO ACT.
WELL, YEAH.
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU GET HIM TO ACT?
I DIDN'T GET HIM TO ACT. I MEAN --
Jimmy: IS HE -- IS HE A GOOD ACTOR?
WELL, YEAH AS IT TURNS OUT HE IS A GOOD ACTOR.
Jimmy: WHAT IS HE PLAYING?
HE'S PLAYING MY BROTHER, THE MORTICIAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT IS AWESOME! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? COME ON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE HAD --
Jimmy: THAT'S SO COOL. COME ON.
WE HAD TALKED ABOUT IT DURING "THE SOPRANOS" YEARS. I SAID, YOU KNOW, "YOU SHOULD COME ON, LIKE, AS MY BROTHER FROM THE OLD COUNTRY. HE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH." YOU KNOW, JUST KIND OF DO A A BIT.
Jimmy: PERFECT FOR BRUCE, RIGHT? HE'S LIKE, "I CAN'T REALLY TALK --" YOU'LL GOT TO DO A LOT OF EDITING, RIGHT? HE TALKS FOR LIKE SIX HOURS. OKAY, GOOD. WE'VE GOT TO EDIT IT DOWN, BRUCE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH.
SO, WE FINALLY DID IT. WE FINALLY DID IT. HE ACTUALLY PLAYS MY BROTHER. YOU KNOW, TONY SIRICO'S MY OLDER BROTHER, THE PRIEST.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WE INTRODUCED IN THE FINAL EPISODE LAST YEAR.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO COOL.
AND THEN BRUCE PLAYS THE MIDDLE BROTHER, GIUSEPPE, THE MORTICIAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I GOT TO SAY, I WATCHE THE SHOW OBVIOUSLY. BUT THEN I SAW A TRAILER FOR THE SHOW OR ACTUALLY IT WAS A A VIDEO, I THINK, THE RELEASE FOR THIS SCORE.
WELL, YEAH. THE FIRST SINGLE IS ACTUALLY FRANK SINGING.
Jimmy: YES, SINGING LIKE "MY KIND OF TOWN" BUT WITH THE WORDS OF "LILYHAMMER." IT'S VERY, VERY FUNNY. YOU SHOULD WATCH IT ON YOUTUBE. BUT YOU HAVE A GREAT VOICE.
WELL, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU REALLY DO.
IT'S REALLY HIM. IT'S REALLY HIM.
Jimmy: IT'S HIM, BUT YEAH, BUT IT'S ALSO YOU GOT THE PROPS.
IT'S THE HAIR DOING THE SINGING ACTUALLY.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT THE HAIR DOING THE SINGING. BUT I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT THE SINATRA THING. YOU'VE GOT IT IN YOU, MAN.
I LOVE HIM. I DO LOVE HIM.
Jimmy: COULD YOU GIVE EVERYONE A TASTE OF A LITTLE SINATRA?
DO YOU WANNA DO THAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. ONLY IF YOU WILL JOIN ME. WILL YOU JOIN ME?
Jimmy: OF COURSE, I'LL JOIN YOU.
DO I GOT THE BAND?
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY THIS WEEK, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
IT'S HIS 99TH BIRTHDAY.
Jimmy: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, FRANK.
THAT'S RIGHT. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, FRANK.
