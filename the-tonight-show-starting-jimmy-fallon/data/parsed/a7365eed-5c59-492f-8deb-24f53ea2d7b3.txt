THE POLICE HAVE ACTUALLY JUST STARTED ARRESTING JOURNALISTS. IT'S TRUE. BUT WHEN THE COPS SAW THE CREW FROM CNN, THEY WERE LIKE, "WELL, YOU GUYS ARE FINE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HEY! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PLUS, PEOPLE ARE STILL FIGHTING ABOUT IMMIGRATION. CONGRESS IS SUING THE PRESIDENT. I'M NOT SAYING THINGS ARE BAD, BUT THE MIDDLE EAST JUST SENT DIPLOMATS TO NEGOTIATE PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THAT OBAMA WON'T MAKE ANY MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS DURING HIS TRIP BACK TO D.C., BUT THE WHITE HOUSE DID SAY THAT OBAMA WOULD BE MAKING SOME MINOR ANNOUNCEMENTS, LIKE, "JUST MIXED A BOWL OF FRUITY PEBBLES WITH COCOA PEBBLES 'CAUSE I'M THE PRESIDENT AND I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A MINOR ANNOUNCEMENT.
Steve: THAT'S A MINOR ANNOUNCEMENT.

Jimmy: EARLY 1900's. AND IT'S GOREY.
YEAH, I MEAN IT WAS A REALLY EXCITING TIME BACK THEN BECAUSE THEY WERE COMING UP WITH SO MANY NEW DISCOVERIES. THEY WERE REALLY AT THE FOREFRONT OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING, AND IT'S A COOL LOOK TO LOOK BACK A HUNDRED YEARS AND SAY, "OH, THIS IS WHAT WE KNEW AND WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW."
Jimmy: YEAH BECAUSE SOME OF IT IS JUST CRAZY. A LOT OF IT IS JUST BREAKING INTO SKULLS.
OH YES. IT GOES THERE.

[ APPLAUSE ] YEAH, YOU NEED 'EM. YEAH. 'CAUSE THEY DO STUFF THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DO. LIKE, I ENJOY FRUIT. I DO. I LOVE IT. BUT I DON'T ENJOY IT ENOUGH TO GO PICK IT. I KNOW I DON'T ENJOY IT THAT MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] I NEED IT ALREADY PREPACKAGED AT THE STORE ALREADY. YEAH, I JUST LIKE ALREADY PRE-PACKAGED FRUITS. SO, UH, YEAH, BUT YOU GOTTA KNOW -- YEAH, WE JUST LIVE IN A A DIFFERENT WORLD NOW. EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT. EVERYTHING IS ABOUT RESTRICTIONS AND HOLDING STUFF, YOU KNOW. LIKE, YOU CAN'T GO IN A PUBLIC RESTROOM NO MORE AND GET WATER LIKE YOU USED TO. I DON'T KNOW WHO STARTED THE WATER RESTRICTIONS. BUT YOU KNOW, YOU JUST TURN ON THE WATER. YOU USED TO, BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT TO GET IN FRONT OF THE IT AND SEE IF SOMETHING'S GONNA COME OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYTHING IS AUTOMATED. YOU'VE GOT TO DO THE THING ON THE PAPER TOWEL. IT'S LIKE, MAN, THAT IS REALLY CRAZY RIGHT THERE. AND I DON'T LIKE THE TOILET WHEN I DON'T KNOW WHO IN CONTROL OF THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY WATCHING ME. I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY IS WATCHING ME. 'CAUSE SOMETIMES YOU'LL BE HANDLING YOUR BUSINESS AND IT'S JUST, BOOM, OUT OF NOWHERE, IT WILL JUST GO AWAY. AND YOU WERE LIKE, "MAN, I WASN'T EVEN DONE YET. I WASN'T EVEN DONE YET. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO WAIT UNTIL I GET HOME." SO, YEAH, IT'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE. IT'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE OUT THERE. YOU CAN'T GO TO THE GROCERY STORE NO MORE. I DON'T KNOW WHO STARTED THIS LITTLE MOVEMENT THAT YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK YOURSELF OUT NOW. BUT THAT AIN'T WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO WHEN I'M GOING INTO THE GROCERY STORE. I CAME IN AS A SHOPPER. I WANT TO LEAVE AS A SHOPPER. [ LAUGHTER ] YES, THAT'S MY GOAL BUT, NOW, YOU'RE A TEAM MEMBER NOW. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW. YEAH, 'CAUSE THE LADY TRICKED ME. SHE'S LIKE, "SIR, THERE'S NO WAITING OVER HERE." I WALKED OVER THERE AND SHE JUST WALKED THE HELL AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS LIKE, "WHOA, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WHERE ARE YOU GOING?" SHE'S LIKE, "SIR, YOU CAN CHECK YOURSELF OUT." I SAID, "WELL, I DON'T WORK HERE. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT AT ALL." [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, THESE ARE MY CLOTHES RIGHT HERE. THESE ARE MY CLOTHES. I CAME IN WITH THIS ON. BUT, SHE FELT LIKE I WAS QUALIFIED. SO I SAID, "WHAT THE HELL. TURN ON MY LIGHT. I GUESS I'M OPEN. I GUESS I'M OPEN." [ APPLAUSE ] YEAH, I APPRECIATE IT. I APPRECIATE IT. PEOPLE STARTED GETTING IN MY LINE. I SAID, "WAIT A MINUTE, I'VE GOT TO LEARN MY FRUIT CODES. I GOTTA LEARN MY FRUIT CODES." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT THERE, YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW YOUR FRUIT CODES. HEY, MAN, Y'ALL BEEN AN ENJOYABLE AUDIENCE. I'VE BEEN ROD MAN. THANK YOU ALL, MAN.
