IT'S GETTING THINNER AND THINNER. HONESTLY, THIS -- IN AN ELEVATOR, IF I LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND THE LIGHTS ARE BAD, IT LOOKS LIKE AN X-RAY. [ LAUGHTER ] HONESTLY. IT'S JUST GETTING THINNER AND THINNER, AND I'VE GOT TO HIDE ALL THE BALD SPOTS AND EVERYTHING. WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, I LOOK LIKE A BABY BIRD. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST AWFUL. AND I WAS TRYING TO HOLD ON TO IT BUT IT'S FINE. I'M HAVING A -- I NEVER WEAR A A WIG. I WOULD NEVER WEAR A WIG. I WAS -- IT'S CRAZY. GUYS, DON'T EVER WEAR A WIG.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH IT, RIGHT?
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH IT. YOU WALK INTO A ROOM AND YOU THINK NO ONE KNOWS, EVERYONE KNOWS, ALL RIGHT? EVERYONE. I WAS TAUGHT THAT FOR LIFE BY MY UNCLE REGINALD, TRUE STORY, SO MY UNCLE REGINALD, LITTLE GUY, AND HE WENT BALD FROM EARLY, LIKE 21, 22. HE WAS COMPLETELY BALD FROM THE AGE OF 25 TO 30-SOMETHING, RIGHT, JUST BALD. TURNS UP ONE DAY, FULL HEAD OF HAIR. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] JUST LIKE ELVIS AT THE DOOR, RIGHT? AND WE WERE -- WE WERE LIED TO. HIS FAMILY GOT EMBROILED. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ABOUT EIGHT, I ASKED MY AUNTIE WHY UNCLE REGINALD'S HAIR GREW BACK, AND SHE WENT, IT'S A A MIRACLE. IT'S A MIRACLE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY COULD NEVER -- HE COULD NEVER ADMIT IT. HE COULDN'T DO -- HE'D RUN FOR A BUS LIKE THAT JUST IN CASE. SERIOUSLY. MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE. WE WEREN'T ALLOWED BALLOONS AT PARTIES, BECAUSE MY AUNTIE SAID, "OH NO, UNCLE REGINALD'S ALLERGIC TO BALLOONS." HE WASN'T ALLERGIC TO BALLOONS. HE WAS WORRIED ONE OF US WOULD RUB THEM ON A JUMPER.
Jimmy: ANOTHER HAIR AND MAGNET TRICK.
YES.
Jimmy: YEAH, NO YOU DON'T DO THAT.
IT'S RIDICULOUS. THERE'S PICTURES OF HIM, OLD PICTURES OF HIM, BLESS HIM, HE'S DEAD NOW. HE WORE THAT WIG FROM 35 TO HE DIED ABOUT 75 A FEW YEARS AGO. HE'S BURIED WITH IT. IT'S PROBABLY STILL FINE. IT'S PROBABLY A SKELETON WITH A A FULL HEAD OF HAIR. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT WE WERE LOOKING BACK AT OLD PICTURES OF HIM AT LIKE WEDDINGS AND CHRISTMAS AND HE'S HOLDING A BABY, HE'S ALWAYS HOLDING IT AT ARM'S LENGTH SO IT CAN'T GRAB HIS WIG. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT. OF COURSE.
BUT HIS WHOLE LIFE WAS, HE COULDN'T DO STUFF.
Jimmy: BECAUSE OF THAT WIG.
I THINK HE WORE IT AT HOME BECAUSE IF WE WENT ROUND, WE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR, AUNTIE WOULD LOOK OUT AND THEN YOU'D SEE HER, "GO, PUT IT ON. THEY'RE COMING IN." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU SURPRISED ME.
HE HAD A WIG. HE HAD FALSE TEETH. HE HAD HIP REPLACEMENT. BY THE TIME HE DIED, HE WASN'T MY UNCLE ANYMORE. HE WAS SOMEONE ELSE.
Jimmy: HE DIED SOMEONE ELSE.
SOME ONE ELSE. I'LL BUZZ IT OFF WHEN IT GOES. I'M NEVER GOING TO WEAR A WIG.
Jimmy: IT WOULD LOOK FANTASTIC. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS HUMAN BEING. GOSH, I'M SO HAPPY HE'S BACK. I LOVE DAVID BRENT. EVERYBODY LOVES HIM BUT THEY LOVE -- IS IT LOVE -- HE MAKES HE FEEL SO BAD FOR HIM.
YEAH, I FEEL SORRY, BUT I THINK PEOPLE FEEL EVEN MORE SORRY FOR HIM BECAUSE IN "THE OFFICE," IN "THE OFFICE," HE WAS SORT OF 39 AND HE WAS A A BASTARD AND WORKING FOR BASICALLY NICE PEOPLE AND HE THOUGHT THIS DOCUMENTARY WOULD MAKE HIM FAMOUS. AND YOU KNOW, NOW HE'S BACK, HE'S 55, HE'S A TAMPON REP -- [ LAUGHTER ]

AND HE'S SPENDING ALL HIS HARD-EARNED CASH, HE'S CASHED IN PENSIONS, HE'S PUT TOGETHER A GROUP OF SESSION MUSICIANS AND THEY'RE JUST IN IT FOR THE MONEY, AND HE BOOKS GIGS, HE THINKS HE'S GOING TO BE DISCOVERED AND IT'S JUST REALLY QUITE CRINGEY AND SAD.
Jimmy: YEAH IT REALLY IS. BUT I LOVE THE SONGS IN HERE. THE ONE SONG, "DON'T CRY, IT'S CHRISTMAS."
YEAH -- [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HIM SINGING TO A LITTLE ORPHAN THAT'S DYING.
Jimmy: OH MY GOD. EQUALITY STREET.
EQUALITY STREET. THAT'S HIM THINKING HE'S, YOU KNOW, JUST CHANGING THE FACE OF, YOU KNOW, CURING RACISM AND HOMOPHOBIA AND HE GETS IT ALL SLIGHTLY WRONG. HE TRIES HIS BEST. HE DID A SONG CALLED LADY GYPSY ABOUT WHEN HE LOSES HIS VIRGINITY TO A GYPSY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT I LOVE THAT THIS IS AN ACTUAL -- THIS IS A MUSIC BOOK.
IT'S A REAL SONGBOOK. YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: WITH CHORDS AND GUITAR CHORDS AND PEOPLE CAN --
HE MEANS IT, YOU KNOW, DAVID BRENT, YOU KNOW, HE MEANS THESE SONGS. HE THINKS THEIR GREAT AND HE'S A HUNDRED PERCENT BEHIND THEM AND THIS IS LIKE HIS DREAM COME TRUE THAT HE'S GOT A SONGBOOK OUT AND HE'S GOT AN ALBUM OUT, BUT YEAH, THE TOUR IS --
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT HE'S -- HE'S THAT CONFIDENT IN HIS MUSIC --
HE JUST WANTS TO BE FAMOUS. WELL ALL OF IT LIKE, HE WANTS TO BE LOVED AND HE WANTS TO BE FAMOUS AND HE'S DOING IT ALL WRONG AND HE SEES THESE TALENT SHOWS, YOU KNOW, "X FACTOR" AND "IDOL" AND THAT --
Jimmy: "THE VOICE."

I'VE BEEN OUT WITH ALL SORTS OF GIRLS, RICH GIRLS, POOR GIRLS, WHITE GIRLS, YOU KNOW? THIN GIRLS, FAT GIRLS. I WENT OUT WITH A VERY BIG LADY. LOVELY, BUBBLY, BEAUTIFUL EYES. ALL MY MATES WERE LIKE, "OH, BRENT, IF SHE LOST WEIGHT, SHE'S BE AN ABSOLUTE STUNNER." AND SHEDID LOSE WEIGHT, AND SHE WASN'T A STUNNER, WHICH WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. SURPRISE TO EVERYONE. I THINK SHE LEFT IT A BIT LATE IN LIFE AND LOST IT WAY TOO QUICKLY, SO SHE WAS LEFT WITH THAT SORT OF WATTLE THING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND SHE WASN'T BUBBLY ANYMORE. A BIT GRUMPY. ALWAYS HUNGRY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: I'M HONORED. I LOVE THAT.
YEAH, SO IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL. IT'S MY FIRST TIME WALKING THROUGH THE CURTAIN.
Jimmy: HOW'D IT FEEL?
IT FELT GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S AWESOME.
IT FELT RIGHT.
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC. OH, SHE'S 3 NOW. THAT'S GREAT.
YEAH, SO NOW WE WATCH A NEW DISNEY MOVIE EVERY NIGHT AND, YOU KNOW, POOR THING HAS AN ACTRESS AND A SINGER FOR A MOM. SO NOW EVERY MORNING AT BREAKFAST I REENACT THE MUSICAL NUMBERS FOR HIM. AND NOW WHEN HE WATCHES THE MOVIES AND HE SEES BELLE IN "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST," HE GOES, "THAT'S MAMA." AND I GO, "THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S MAMA."
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S MAMA. THAT'S RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY. YEAH. LAST TIME, I THINK, I STILL HAVE THE SOUND. MY BABIES GO TO BED. WE HAVE -- THEY HAVE A THING CALLED ROCK A A BYE BABY OR ROCK-A-BABY --
ROCK A BYE BABY.
Jimmy: AND IT'S ALL MODERN MUSIC BUT --
LIKE TINKER PIANOS AND XYLOPHONES AND LULLABIES.
Jimmy: XYLOPHONES, YEAH. AND IT'S GREAT. THE BABIES LOVE IT, AND THEY FALL ASLEEP. BUT I HAVE THE MONITOR NEXT TO THE BED, AND I KNOW ALL THE SONGS. AND SO I'M LIKE, "THAT'S FOO FIGHTERS." AND IT KEEPS ME AWAKE. AND I GOT TO CHANGE IT.
YEAH, BABY MONITORS.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH. ARE YOU HAPPY TO BE BACK IN NEW YORK? YOU USED TO LIVE HERE, RIGHT?
I USED TO LIVE HERE. YES. I ACTUALLY HAVE MY OLD NEW YORK ADDRESS TATTOOED ON MY RIBS RIGHT HERE.
Jimmy: DO YOU REALLY?
344. YEAH, I WAS A LITTLE EAST VILLAGE CHICK.
Jimmy: YEAH, COOL, YEAH.
NOW I LIVE IN TENNESSEE. I'M, YOU KNOW, IN THE SOUTH.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MISS ABOUT THE CITY? ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR?
OH, MY GOD. I MEAN, EVERY TIME I CAME HERE, SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENED. EVERY TIME I DIDN'T THINK NEW YORK WAS GOING TO DO THIS THING, IT ALWAYS DID THE THING.
Jimmy: I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. YEAH.
I GOT OBSESSED WITH THIS PLACE, SLEEP NO MORE. YOU'VE BEEN. RIGHT?
Jimmy: NO, I'VE NOT BEEN.
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO SLEEP NO MORE? IT'S AN INTERACTIVE, LIKE, CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE PLAY. AND SO THEY HIDE PEOPLE IN IT. IT'S LIKE A SIX-STORY PLAY, AND THEY HIDE PEOPLE IN IT TO DO ONE-ON-ONE SCENES WITH A PERSON FROM THE AUDIENCE. AND SO I WENT TO GO SEE THE SHOW A FEW TIMES, BECAME OBSESSED, ASKED THEM IF I COULD SING AT THE BAR. AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WE WANT YOU TO BE IN THE SHOW." AND I FREAKED OUT. AND SO MY JOB WAS TO PULL STRANGERS INTO A ROOM AND LOCK MYSELF IN THERE WITH THEM -- YEAH. IN NEW YORK. LIKE, ON THE WEEKEND. THERE WAS ALCOHOL INVOLVED.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND AFTERWARDS, LIKE, THEY TURNED THE WHOLE PLAY INTO A A PARTY AND BJORK CAME AND DEEJAYED. AND I WOULD DRESS UP LIKE --
Jimmy: THE REAL BJORK?
THE REAL BJORK. YEAH. I JUST RAN INTO HER AND I WAS DRESSED UP LIKE ZIGGY STARDUST 'CAUSE IT WAS A SCIENCE FICTION THEMED PARTY. AND THEN PEOPLE WANTED THE ONE-ON-ONE WHO MISSED IT. SO THEN I HAD TO DO IT DRESSED LIKE ZIGGY STARDUST. SO I WENT FROM LOVING THIS PLAY TO BEING IN IT AS ZIGGY STARDUST WITH BJORK.
Jimmy: WITH BJORK --
AND THAT WAS JUST LIKE A A NORMAL WEEK IN NEW YORK.
Jimmy: THAT'S NEW YORK CITY FOR YOU. YEAH, YOU JUST END UP HANGING OUT WITH BJORK DEEJAYING WITH YOU. YEAH.
YOU FALL DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE. YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO FUN. WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT "WESTWORLD." CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. ALL THE REVIEWS ARE GREAT. THE SHOW IS FANTASTIC.
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY SHOW.
Jimmy: YOU ARE EXTRAORDINARY IN IT IN PARTICULAR.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S TRICKY. CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT IN A COUPLE LINES?
IT'S KIND OF LIKE "SLEEP NO MORE," EXCEPT IT'S SET IN -- IT'S SET SOMEWHERE IN THE DISTANT FUTURE WHERE AI, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, HAS BECOME INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMAN BEINGS. SO THEY'VE CREATED THIS THEME PARK THAT'S ABOUT AS BIG AS A A CONTINENT. AND YOU PAY LOTS OF MONEY TO GO IN THERE. AND BASICALLY THEY'VE RECREATED THE WILD WEST AND HAVE THESE HOSTS, BUT THEY'RE ROBOTS. THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE ROBOTS AND YOU BASICALLY GO AND HAVE WHATEVER KIND OF ADVENTURE YOU WANT, BUT YOU CAN BE WHOEVER YOU WANT, WHETHER THAT BE GOOD OR BAD. YOU CAN INDULGE IN ALL YOUR -- CRAZIES.
Jimmy: YOU CAN BE A A VILLAIN --
YOU CAN BE A VILLAIN, YOU CAN BE THE HERO.
Jimmy: YOU CAN BE A HERO. YEAH.
YEAH, SO IT'S A VERY INTENSE SHOW. KIND OF AN INTELLECTUAL NIGHTMARE AND I PLAY--
Jimmy: YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S A ROBOT AND WHO'S NOT A ROBOT.
YOU DON'T. NO, YOU DON'T. THAT'S PART OF THE FUN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT I AM A ROBOT. I'M THE OLDEST HOST IN THE PARK. SO LOT OF TWIST TURNS THERE.
Jimmy: IS THERE ANY TIPS TO ACTING LIKE A ROBOT? IS THERE ANYTHING THAT MAKES IT TRICKIER THAN NORMAL?
THERE'S TONS OF THINGS THAT MAKE IT TRICKIER. I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AS AN ACTOR. AND WE ENDED UP NICKNAMING THEM BOT THOUGHTS BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE MOMENTS WHERE I'M LIKE, "DO I SQUINT IN THE SUN? AM I AFFECTED BY THIS? IS THIS PART OF MY PROGRAMMING?" SO WE'D ALWAYS HAVE TO STOP AND GO, "I GOT A BOT THOUGHT. IS THIS ANALYSIS MODE? WHERE AM I RIGHT NOW?"
Jimmy: DOES THIS ROBOT LIKE BANANAS? OR DOES HE NOT LIKE BANANAS? QUICK BOT THOUGHT.
QUICK BOT THOUGHT. YEAH.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. HERE'S EVAN RACHEL WOOD IN SUNDAY NIGHTS'S EPISODE. DO YOU WANT TO SET THEM UP AT ALL? WHAT'S HAPPENING SUNDAY?
THIS IS EPISODE FIVE. THIS IS NEXT WEEK. AND THIS IS WHEN THINGS -- WE TAKE IT TO 11. BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW, ONE OF THE GUESTS IS QUITE TAKEN WITH ME, AND HE'S ASKING ME QUESTIONS AND NOTICING THAT I'M NOT RESPONDING TO HIM THE WAY THAT A ROBOT NORMALLY SHOULD. I'M KIND OF GOING INTO MY PROGRAMMING AND IT'S MAKING HIM QUESTION THINGS. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

Jimmy: SO GOOD COME ON, FANTASTIC. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT YOU'RE IN A BAND.
YES, I ALSO STARTED A BAND IN ALL THIS CRAZINESS.
Jimmy: REBEL AND A BASKET CASE.
REBEL AND A BASKET CASE. YES, WE'RE NAMED AFTER JOHN HUGHES' "BREAKFAST CLUB" CHARACTERS.
Jimmy: WHY'S THAT?
ME AND MY BAND MATE -- WE'RE AN ELECTRO POP DUO. AND WE MET DOING A JOHN HUGHES CABARET WHERE WE REENACTED THE BEST SCENES FROM "SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL" AND "PRETTY IN PINK" AND "BREAKFAST CLUB." AND WE SANG SONGS FROM THE SOUNDTRACK. AND WE DID THAT FOR ABOUT FIVE MONTHS. AND WHEN IT ENDED, WE COULDN'T ACCEPT IT. WE DIDN'T WANT TO STOP SO WE MADE THIS SIDE PROJECT THAT KIND OF SNOWBALLED INTO THIS BAND AND THIS ALBUM, WHICH SHOULD BE COMING OUT IN A A COUPLE WEEKS. WE JUST RELEASED OUR SECOND EP AND ANOTHER MUSIC VIDEO.
Jimmy: REBEL AND A BASKET CASE.
