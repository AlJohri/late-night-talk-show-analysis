Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- TINA FEY, RACHEL MADDOW, MUSICAL GUEST SANTIGOLD, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 429! WOO!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! HI, EVERYBODY! HELLO, WELCOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HI, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYONE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. HOT CROWD. OH, MAKES ME FEEL GOOD. GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN TONIGHT. THIS IS A GOOD SHOW. THIS IS A GREAT SHOW TO BE AT TONIGHT. THIS IS THE ONE. THIS IS THE ONE TO WATCH.
Audience: YES IT IS! [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: WELL, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, YESTERDAY WAS SUPER TUESDAY. AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA COME DOWN TO DONALD TRUMP VERSUS HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE PRESIDENCY. EVEN THE ALIEN AND PREDATOR ARE LIKE, "THIS IS TOO SCARY TO WATCH." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. DONALD TRUMP WON THE MOST STATES OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES YESTERDAY, BUT TED CRUZ ALSO PICKED UP ENOUGH DELEGATES TO KEEP THE RACE CLOSE. THAT'S RIGHT. EXPERTS SAY THEY'RE NOW NECKS AND NECKS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT'S A TIGHT RACE.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND CHRIS CHRISTIE STOOD RIGHT BEHIND TRUMP AT HIS VICTORY SPEECH LAST NIGHT. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] AND A LOT OF PEOPLE NOTICED THAT CHRISTIE DIDN'T LOOK TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT. CHECK THIS -- CHECK THIS OUT. LOOK AT THIS.
THE VIRGINIA WIN WAS JUST A A GREAT WIN, BECAUSE IT'S A A PLACE THAT IS JUST SPECTACULAR AND A PLACE THAT WE HAVE BIG INVESTMENTS IN, AS WE HAVE IN FLORIDA. REMEMBER, WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES IN FLORIDA, ALL ALONG MIAMI, DORAL, MAR-A-LAGO.
Jimmy: AT THIS POINT, CHRISTIE'S FACE IS BASICALLY AMERICA'S FACE. IT'S LIKE -- IT'S REALLY HAPPENING? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DID YOU GUYS HEAR THIS? IT WAS REVEALED RECENTLY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS PRETTY SENSITIVE ABOUT THE SIZE OF HIS HANDS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, IT CAUSED SOME OF THE CANDIDATES AND MEDIA OUTLETS TO JOKE THAT HE'S GOT REALLY SMALL HANDS. AND I THINK IT'S FINALLY GETTING TO HIM. AND CHECK OUT -- CHECK HIM OUT AFTER HIS SPEECH LAST TONIGHT.
NO COUNTRY CAN SUSTAIN THAT KIND OF -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S ODD. DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S ODD? THAT'S A LITTLE ODD, RIGHT?
Steve: IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.
Jimmy: AND HILLARY CLINTON HAD A BIG NIGHT, PICKING UP VICTORIES IN SEVEN STATES. [ CHEERS ] WHILE SPEAKING IN MIAMI LAST NIGHT HILLARY SAID, QUOTE, "I BELIEVE WHAT WE NEED IN AMERICA TODAY IS MORE LOVE AND KINDNESS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN SHE ADDED, "AND I WILL CRUSH ANYONE WHO WON'T LET ME DO IT." [ LAUGHTER ] CRUSH! [ APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, DURING HER VICTORY RALLY LAST NIGHT, ONE OF THE THINGS HILLARY SAID WAS THAT SHE WANTS TO BUILD A LADDER OF OPPORTUNITY. THEN PEOPLE IN MEXICO SAID, "GREAT, WE'LL USE IT TO CLIMB OVER THE OTHER GUY'S DUMB WALL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE'LL GET OVER THE WALL, BUILD A LADDER. THIS IS PRETTY WEIRD. WHEN FOX NEWS PROJECTED THAT HILLARY CLINTON WON THE TENNESSEE PRIMARY LAST NIGHT, THEY SHOWED A VERY PRECISE PERCENTAGE FOR HER VOTE TOTAL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] 66.6. WHEN ASKED IF THAT MEANT ANYTHING, HILLARY'S LIKE, "OF COURSE NOT!" I MEAN, "OF COURSE NOT, HA HA HA." [ APPLAUSE ] BUT IT'S ALL -- IT'S NOT ALL GOOD NEWS FOR HILLARY. HER LAST BATCH OF HER PRIVATE SERVER E-MAILS WAS RELEASED THIS WEEK, AND IN SOME OF THE E-MAILS CLINTON COMPLAINS ABOUT SOME TROUBLE WITH HER FAX MACHINE. HILLARY'S EXACT WORDS WERE, "THIS PIECE OF CRAP ISN'T SHREDDING ANYTHING." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: NOT WORKING. NOT WORKING. FAX MACHINE'S BROKE. MEANWHILE, BILL CLINTON WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR HILLARY AT POLLING PLACES IN BOSTON. AND SOME SAID THAT HE BROKE THE RULE THAT YOU CAN'T CAMPAIGN WITHIN 150 FEET OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VOTING. THEN BILL SAID, "TRUST ME, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE I'M NOT ALLOWED TO BE WITHIN 150 FEET OF." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Steve: POLLING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT BERNIE SANDERS IS STILL HANGING IN THERE. IN FACT HE WOUND UP WINNING FOUR STATES LAST NIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND HE SAID THAT HE'S LOOKING FORWARD TO BRINGING VERMONT VALUES TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AND AMERICANS SAID, "IF YOU'RE TALKING WEED AND ICE CREAM, I THINK WE CAN SETTLE THIS RIGHT NOW." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, LET'S DO IT. LET'S DO IT. AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, BEN CARSON IS STILL IN THE RACE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE GAVE ANOTHER ELECTRIFYING SPEECH LAST NIGHT. SOMETIMES WE LIKE TO COUNT HOW OFTEN A POLITICIAN BLINKS WHILE GIVING A SPEECH. BUT WITH CARSON, IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT MORE FUN TO COUNT HOW MANY TIMES HE EVEN OPENS HIS EYES. [ LAUGHTER ] WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO THE VIDEO. CHECK THIS OUT.
AND WE STILL HAVE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO ARE SAYING ON FACEBOOK YOU CANNOT LEAVE US. WE HAVE TO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: FOUR TIMES. FOUR TIMES.
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: CARSON'S THE FIRST HUMAN TO GET 25 HOURS OF SLEEP PER DAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE'S THE FIRST HUMAN -- GOOD FOR HIM. I FEEL BAD MAKING FUN OF CARSON, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S GONNA SEE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, I SAW THAT APPLE IS EXPECTED TO HOLD ITS NEW PRODUCT EVENT LATER THIS MONTH AND MANY SPECULATE A SMALLER iPHONE COULD BE ANNOUNCED. AND I GUESS THEY WANT TO ATTRACT iPHONE USERS WITH SMALLER HANDS. THEN TRUMP WAS LIKE, "GET ME ONE OF THOSE TINY iPHONES." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW! GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WELCOME, EVERYBODY. IT'S BEEN A GREAT WEEK SO FAR. THERE'S MORE AHEAD. TOMORROW NIGHT, PHARRELL WILLIAMS AND PRIYANKA CHOPRA WILL BE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN ON FRIDAY GWYNETH PALTROW WILL BE STOPPING BY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PLUS YOUTUBE STAR TYLER OAKLEY AND MUSIC FROM THE WHO.
Steve: WHOA! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S FIDAY.
Steve: MAN.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE A A GOOD, GOOD, GOOD SHOW. BUT FIRST JOINING US TONIGHT IS A PROLIFIC AND INCREDIBLY TALENTED WRITER AND PERFORMER. SHE STARS ALONGSIDE MARGOT ROBBIE IN A BIG NEW MOVIE CALLED "WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT." SHE IS FANTASTIC IN THE MOVIE. THE MOVIE IS ACTION PACKED AND IT'S FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY 'CAUSE IT'S TINA FEY. BUT SHE -- GREAT PERFORMANCES. TINA FEY IS HERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
Steve: COME ON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SHE ROCKS IT.
Steve: SHE'S EXCELLENT.
Jimmy: SHE DESTROYS. SHE IS SO GOOD IN THIS MOVIE. PEOPLE ARE GONNA FLIP OUT. AND WE ALWAYS LIKE TO TRY NEW GAMES WITH TINA, BECAUSE SHE'S THE BEST AT EVERYTHING. AND TONIGHT TINA HAS AGREED TO TRY A FUN NEW GAME CALLED "KNOW IT ALL." SO, STICK AROUND FOR THAT. IT'S GONNA BE FUN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PLUS, FRESH OFF HER LIVE ALL-NIGHT POLITICAL COVERAGE OF SUPER TUESDAY, RACHEL MADDOW IS DROPPING BY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GONNA TALK TO HER ABOUT THE LATEST ON THE BIG PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. AND WE HAVE GREAT MUSIC FROM SANTIGOLD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SANTIGOLD HAS A NEW RECORD OUT. "99 CENTS."
Steve: OH.
Jimmy: YEAH, THE RECORD ITSELF, IT COSTS PROBABLY $12.99. PROBABLY 15 -- DEPENDS. IT VARIES.
Steve: WHERE YOU BUY IT.
Jimmy: BUT THE NAME OF THE ALBUM IS "99 CENTS." BUT THAT IS NOT THE --
Steve: PRICE OF THE ALBUM.
Jimmy: PRICE OF THE ALBUM.
Steve: THAT IS ONLY THE NAME OF THE ALBUM.
Jimmy: I CAN SEE WHERE YOU COULD BE CONFUSED.
Steve: SO, I WENT TO THE STORE AND I BOUGHT IT AND I GO, "THIS IS 99 CENTS." THE GUY GOES, "NO, IT'S $14.95." I GO --
Jimmy: BUT IT'S -- IT IS "99 CENTS."
Steve: HE WAS RIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
Steve: IT WAS $14.95. BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE BURNED DOWN THE STORE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT WAS A MISTAKE THAT YOU MADE, BUT THAT'S ON YOU, YOU KNOW?
Steve: MY BAD.
Jimmy: THAT'S MY BAD. THAT'S ON ME, MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, MAN. DAMN, DANIEL.
Steve: DAMN, DANIEL. [ LAUGHTER ] DAMN.
Jimmy: DAMN, DANIEL. [ LAUGHTER ] AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE, YESTERDAY WAS SUPER TUESDAY. AND DONALD TRUMP WAS THE BIG WINNER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. HE IS NOW THE SOLID FRONT-RUNNER TO GET THE GOP NOMINATION. AND AFTER THE RESULTS CAME IN LAST NIGHT, TRUMP SPOKE TO THE MEDIA AND HIS SUPPORTERS. TAKE A LOOK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK ME, THANK ME, THANK ME VERY MUCH. THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING NIGHT. WE'VE ALREADY WON FIVE STATES. AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE COULD WIN SIX OR SEVEN OR EIGHT OR NINE. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE A MILLION STATES BY THE TIME THE NIGHT IS OVER. NOW, I'LL ADMIT I DIDN'T WIN EVERY STATE. I ONLY GOT 27% OF THE VOTE IN TEXAS. BUT REMEMBER, EVERYTHING IS BIGGER IN TEXAS. SO 27% IS ACTUALLY MORE LIKE 60%. SO BASICALLY I WON TEXAS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. AND THANK ME. AS FOR OKLAHOMA, LOOK AT IT. IT LOOKS LIKE A TRUMP WIG THAT TEXAS IS WEARING. SO I BASICALLY WON THERE, TOO. OF COURSE, I WANNA THANK GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE FOR HIS UNBLINKING SUPPORT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE THIS GUY. HE'S FANTASTIC. HE'S LIKE MY MINI-ME, EXCEPT BIGGER. HE'S MY MEGA-ME. THANK YOU, MEGA-ME. YOU CAN GO HOME NOW, MEGA-ME. GOOD BOY. GOOD MEGA-ME. NOW SINCE THIS IS A PRESS CONFERENCE, I'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS AND/OR COMPLIMENTS. YOU, GO AHEAD.
YOU'VE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR FAILING TO DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM THE KKK AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS LIKE DAVID DUKE. DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT?
Jimmy: LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE THE KKK. KIM, KHLOE, KOURTNEY, THEY'RE FANTASTIC PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'VE KNOWN THEM A LONG TIME. AS FOR DAVID DUKE, I'VE ALREADY DISAVOWED THAT. I DISAVOWED IT LIKE FIVE TIMES. BUT EVERYONE'S STILL LIKE, "DAMN, DONALD, BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT QUESTION.
DONALD, WHAT'S NEXT? WHAT IF YOU GET AN ENDORSEMENT FROM THE NAZI PARTY?
Jimmy: LOOK, I SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO CANNOT SEE. I LOVE STEVIE WONDER, WHO'S A A FANTASTIC SINGER. MAYBE NOT FOR EVERYBODY, BUT I LOVE HIM, OKAY? BEAUTIFUL.
MARCO RUBIO SAID HE INTENDS TO STAY IN THE RACE. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
Jimmy: I DON'T GET THIS GUY. HE KEEPS GIVING VICTORY SPEECHES. HE HASN'T WON A THING. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S LIKE THAT GUY WHO BRAGS ABOUT BEING THREE NUMBERS AWAY FROM WINNING THE POWERBALL. I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO FOCUS ON. I'VE GOT BIGGER FISH TO FRY. CHRIS, THAT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MY REAL COMPETITION NOW IS HILLARY CLINTON. AND LOOK, I CALLED HILLARY EARLIER, I SAID, "HERE'S THE DEAL. IN 2008 YOU LOST TO A BLACK MAN. BUT IN 2016 YOU'RE GONNA LOSE TO AN ORANGE MAN." THAT'S RIGHT. ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND WE ARE GONNA WIN, WIN, WIN. IN FACT, I DON'T WANNA JUST WIN THE PRESIDENCY. I ALSO WANNA WIN THE LAST SEASON OF "AMERICAN IDOL." SO TEXT "TRUMP" TO 10112. TOGETHER, WE CAN MAKE "AMERICAN IDOL" GREAT AGAIN. CUE THE MUSIC. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: BUT THIS IS BASED ON THE BOOK, RIGHT?
YEAH, THERE'S THIS BOOK, REALLY GREAT BOOK CALLED "THE TALIBAN SHUFFLE." AND IT WAS WRITTEN BY A WOMAN NAMED KIM BARKER WHO WAS A A JOURNALIST WHO GOT SENT -- IT WAS SORT OF LIKE, WE NEED -- WHEN THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN WAS GETTING OUTSHADOWED BY THE WAR IN IRAQ, THEY NEEDED -- THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH JOURNALISTS TO GO OVER THERE. AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WHO DOESN'T HAVE KIDS AND ISN'T MARRIED AND CAN GO?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SHE WAS LIKE, "I'LL GO."

Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST IS THE HOST OF "THE RACHEL MADDOW" SHOW. LAST NIGHT SHE CO-ANCHORED MSNBC'S LIVE POLITICAL COVERAGE OF SUPER TUESDAY. SO SHE'S BEEN UP ALL NIGHT. HERE TO TELL US ABOUT IT, PLEASE WELCOME THE VERY SMART, THE VERY ENGAGING RACHEL MADDOW! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU. WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW WE LOVE YOU HERE.
YOU CAN'T FALL ASLEEP WHEN YOU ARE JUMPING AROUND. A MEDICAL FACT.
Jimmy: MEDICAL FACT, YEAH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
KIND OF, YEAH.
Jimmy: WERE YOU ON TV AT LIKE 1:00, 2:00?
LIKE 2:00 IN THE MORNING, ISH.
Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THE SHOW.
OH, I'M HAPPY TO. THIS IS LIKE POLITICS CHRISTMAS. IT'S VERY EXCITING. THERE'S NO REASON TO SLEEP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S INTERESTING. WERE THERE ANY SURPRISES LAST NIGHT ON SUPER TUESDAY? YEAH.
-- WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A LONG WHILE DURING THE BROADCAST LAST NIGHT WHERE IT LOOKED LIKE THE PERSON WHO MIGHT WIN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IN VERMONT WAS GOING TO BE JOHN KASICH. AND I WAS LIKE, OKAY, THAT'S A A SURPRISE.
Jimmy: NO ONE SAW THAT COMING.
LIKE GOING TO SEE A A BASKETBALL GAME AND ALL THESE SUPER TALL GUYS THEN DANNY DeVITO RUNS ON THE COURT AND HE CAN DUNK! [ LAUGHTER ] WHOA. I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. TURNS OUT HE LOST. HE DIDN'T END UP WINNING.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
FOR A MINUTE IT FELT LIKE THAT WAS GOING TO BE A A SURPRISE.
Jimmy: YEAH. BECAUSE I -- TRUMP AND HILLARY. BUT THERE'S RUMORS THAT BEN CARSON MAY BE DROPPING OUT, BUT HE HASN'T SAID IT.
HE'S KIND OF SORT OF DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE.
Jimmy: HE MIGHT JUST BE TALKING IN HIS SLEEP. [ LAUGHTER ] [ MUMBLING ] I'M HERE. I'M HERE, WHAT IS IT?
HE SAID TECHNICALLY HE DOESN'T SEE A PATH FORWARD, BUT HE'S NOT SUSPENDING YET.
Jimmy: BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO BE AT THE OTHER DEBATES.
AND HE WON'T BE AT THE OTHER DEBATES. I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, BEN CARSON HAS TURNED OUT TO BE HARD TO FOLLOW. IN THIS RACE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT CAN PEOPLE STILL HOP IN NOW? OR IS THE DEADLINE OVER? I DON'T KNOW THE RULES.
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION. I'M NOT SURE ANYBODY KNOWS THE REAL ANSWER. IF YOU WERE GOING TO RUN AS A A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT AT THIS POINT, IT'S PRETTY HARD BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN 15 STATES THAT HAVE ALREADY GONE ON EACH SIDE AND YOU CAN'T COMPETE FOR THOSE. BUT IF YOU WERE GOING TO RUN NOT AS A DEMOCRAT OR A A REPUBLICAN, IF YOU WERE GOING TO RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT OR SOME WEIRD THIRD PARTY THING, NOBODY REALLY KNOWS IF THOSE PEOPLE COULD STILL GET IN AND ACTUALLY CONTEST IT. WE MIGHT FIND OUT IN THE COMING DAYS IF THE REPUBLICANS KEEP FREAKING OUT SO HARD ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THAT THEY DRIVE THEMSELVES INTO SOME CRAZY PLAN LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH. BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE JUST -- THEY JUST LOVE TRUMP. AND THEN SOME REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
YEAH. IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS IRRETRIEVABLY CLEAVING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND THE CLEAVE, LIKE THE TWO SIDES, ARE ALL THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON, ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE BELTWAY PRESS, ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT WHO ARE LIKE, "TRUMP? WE CAN'T GIVE OUR PARTY TO TRUMP! HE'S NUTS!" THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE ALL THE VOTERS -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- WHO WANT DONALD TRUMP.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?
YEAH. SO YOU CAN SPLIT, BUT TRUMP GETS ALL THE VOTERS AND YOU GUYS GET YOURSELVES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT'S A LITTLE NUTTY. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO TAKE IT FROM HIM AT THE CONVENTION, I THINK.
Jimmy: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
EH -- IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PRETTY. IF HE KEEPS WINNING THE WAY HE IS, HE'S GOING TO KEEP WINNING BY FAR THE MOST STATES AND BY FAR THE MOST DELEGATES AND THEIR PLAN, AND THEY'RE SORT OF TALKING ABOUT IT OPENLY NOW, IS ONCE YOU GET TO THE END OF THIS NOMINATING PROCESS AND HE'S DONE EVERYTHING TO WIN THE NOMINATION, AT THE END, WHEN IT COMES TIME TO SAY, OKAY, YOU'RE THE NOMINEE, THEY'RE INSTEAD GOING TO BE LIKE, ACTUALLY, IT'S GOING TO BE THIS GUY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE JUST GOING TO PICK SOMEBODY ELSE EVEN THOUGH HE'S BASICALLY WON THE PROCESS. AND I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK OUT. HOW THAT'S GOING TO STAND. BUT THAT'S THEIR PLAN RIGHT NOW. THAT'S THEIR PLAN, WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO.
Jimmy: INTERESTING.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE.
I DON'T THINK IT IS.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
UNTIL THEY DO IT. THEN IT'S POSSIBLE.
Jimmy: THEN IT'S POSSIBLE. AND THEN, MITT ROMNEY SAID THAT HE'S GOING TO SPEAK TOMORROW. HE'S GOING TO SAY SOMETHING. HE'S ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S GOING TO TALK. ANY IDEA? ANY SCOOP?
I MEAN, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I GUESS HE COULD TRY TO RUN? IF IT GOES TO THE CONVENTION AND THEY TRY TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM TRUMP THEN, NOBODY KNOWS WHO THEY WOULD GIVE IT TO INSTEAD. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMEBODY WHO HAS ALREADY BEEN RUNNING. THEY COULD POCK ANYBODY. THEY COULD PICK MITT ROMNEY, THEY COULD PICK YOU. THEY COULD PICK ANYONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: PLEASE NO, PLEASE NO. I DON'T WANT IT. I DON'T WANT THIS JOB! I DO NOT WANT THIS JOB! THIS IS -- WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT THIS JOB, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? IT'S THE HARDEST JOB IN THE WORLD.
YOU GET YOUR OWN PLANE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO. I CAN'T. I CAN'T DO IT. I LOVE TAKING THE TRAIN. IT'S FANTASTIC. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
YOU COULD PROBABLY GET TRAIN FORCE ONE OR SOMETHING? [ LAUGHTER ] PRESIDENT FALLON DEMANDS A CLUB CAR.
Jimmy: I'M IN! I'M IN IF I GET TRAIN FORCE ONE. THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HOW ABOUT IF KASICH DROPS OUT, THEN IT'S RUBIO OR CRUZ. ANY --
CRUBIO, TRUZ. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MAKE UP NAMES.
I MEAN, AGAIN, THAT SORT OF THE BELTWAY AND THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT HAS DECIDED THAT IT'S DEFINITELY MARCO RUBIO. THAT HE'S DEFINITELY THE BEST CHOICE WHO IS NOT DONALD TRUMP. IF PEOPLE ARE GIVEN THE CHOICE TO PICK MARCO RUBIO, THEY WILL. MARCO RUBIO HASN'T WON ONE STATE OUT OF 15 SO FAR AND IT WAS THE MINNESOTA CAUCUSES. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HE DIDN'T JUST LOSE TO DONALD TRUMP, HE CAME IN THIRD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. HE CAN'T WIN ANYTHING TO SAVE HIS LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY'VE DECIDED THAT HE'S THE WINNER. AND THEY'RE ALL GOING TO SIDE WITH HIM. I DON'T SEE HOW THAT GOES. TED CRUZ HAS ACTUALLY WON SOME STATES BUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOESN'T WANT HIM AS BADLY AS THEY DON'T WANT TRUMP. SO WHERE DOES THIS END?
Jimmy: ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IT'S HILLARY, RIGHT? BASICALLY?
BERNIE IS STILL ALIVE. BERNIE HAS ONE ADVANTAGE. FIRST OF ALL, HE'S SORT OF DOING WHAT HE EXPECTED TO BE DOING. HE WANTED TO WIN MASSACHUSETTS LAST NIGHT AND HE DIDN'T. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, HE'S SORT OF ON TRACK TO WHERE HE WANTED TO BE. THE BIG ADVANTAGE THAT HE'S GOT IS HE'S LIKE CROWD SURFING ON A A SEA OF MONEY. HE HAS SO MUCH MONEY, YOU WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE A SOCIALIST IN THE CROWD. [ LAUGHTER ] HE RAISED MORE MONEY THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY THAN MARCO RUBIO RAISED IN ALL OF JANUARY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LIKE HE'S GOT SO MUCH MONEY. AND IT'S NOT BILLIONAIRES GIVING MONEY TO HIS SUPER PAC AND THEN HE CAN'T CONTROL HOW THAT MONEY GETS SPENT. HE DOESN'T HAVE A SUPER PAC. THAT'S PEOPLE GIVING HIM HONEY THAT HE CAN SPEND IN ANY WAY THAT HE WANTS. THEY'RE GIVING IT TO HIM IN SMALL AMOUNTS SO HE CAN GO BACK TO THEM AND ASK FOR MORE. HE HAS MORE MONEY THAN ANYBODY IN THE RACE DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN.
Jimmy: WOW.
NOBODY KNOWS HOW THAT WORKS WHEN THAT'S THE SOCIALIST. [ LAUGHTER ] SO HE'S -- THERE'S NO REASON TO EXPECT HIM, I THINK, TO GET OUT. IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF HOW HE AND HILLARY CLINTON RUN AND WHETHER HE CAN START TURNING HIS MONEY INTO MORE STATES.
Jimmy: AND THEN LAST QUESTION, WHEN DO WE KIND OF FIND OUT WHO IT IS GOING TO BE? WHAT DO YOU HAVE LEFT? YOU HAVE FLORIDA, IS THAT THE DECIDING THING?
FLORIDA AND OHIO ARE BOTH GOING TO GO ON MARCH 15th. SO THAT'S LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AWAY NOW. AND THOSE WILL BE PRETTY DECISIVE. IF TRUMP WINS FLORIDA AND OHIO, I EVEN DON'T THINK THEY CAN TRY TO STEAL IT ANYMORE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I MEAN, AT THAT POINT HE'S LIKE EARNED IT FAIR AND SQUARE AND TAKING IT AWAY WOULD BE EVEN MORE CRAZY THAN WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING. BUT WE'LL HAVE SOME STUFF HAPPEN BETWEEN THEN. THERE'S SOME RACES THIS WEEKEND, LOUISIANA IS VOTING THIS WEEKEND. THAT WILL BE FUN BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE DAVID DUKE, THE KLANSMAN, RAN AS THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR IN THE '90s AND NOW HE'S ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP AND DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT. THAT WILL BE FUN. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WILL BE THE KLAN-DIDATE EXPERIENCE THIS WEEKEND.
Jimmy: KLAN-DIDATE EXPERIENCE. YEAH.
KLAN-DIDATE EXPERIENCE. THEN MICHIGAN IS ON TUESDAY. THAT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING. BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS WAITING FOR REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN TO RESIGN, WHICH COULD HAPPEN ANY MINUTE BETWEEN NOW AND THAT RACE ON TUESDAY. AND NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT.
Jimmy: SURE, YEAH.
THAT'S OVER THE FLINT, MICHIGAN, LEAD POISONING THING.
Jimmy: DISASTER, YEAH.
SO YEAH, IT'S EXCITING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GREAT JOB. THANK YOU FOR SCHOOLING US AS ALWAYS.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: I LOVE ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS.
ANY TIME.
Jimmy: YOU DO SUCH GREAT WORK. WE LOVE YOU. WE'RE BIG FANS OF YOURS.
