QUEEN ELIZABETH MET WITH POPE FRANCIS FOR THE FIRST TIME. YEP, THE QUEEN GAVE THE POPE A A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY, WHILE THE POPE GAVE HER A SMALL, STONE GLOBE.

RAYMOND BUCKSTON CAME FORWARD THIS WEEK AS THE WINNTER OF FEBRUARY'S BIG POWERBALL JACKPOT. IT WAS $425 MILLION. YEAH. AND THIS IS TRUE -- WHEN HE CLAIMED THE PRIZE, HE WAS WEARING A SHIRT THAT HAD YODA ON IT. AND IT SAID "LUCK OF THE JEDI, I HAVE."
