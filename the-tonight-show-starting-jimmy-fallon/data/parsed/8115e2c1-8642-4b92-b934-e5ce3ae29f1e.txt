HOW WOULD YOU EVEN DO THAT?
Steve: OKAY.
CHEESE QUESADILLA.
Jimmy: WHO GOES FIRST?
JOEL?
Jimmy: I START OFF?
Steve: THE PASSWORD IS -- CHUCKLE. YOU'RE GOING TO START US OFF.
Jimmy: READY? READY? [ LAUGHTER ] GIGGLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GIGGLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
GIDDY?
CAN YOU DO WORDS THAT RHYME?
Jimmy: IT'S NOT GIDDY.
OKAY.
HE HATES ME NOW.
Steve: YOU CAN'T DO WORDS THAT RHYME.
Jimmy: OKAY. WHAT IS GOING ON? YOU CAN'T ASK QUESTIONS.
CAN YOU DO WORDS THAT RHYME?
Jimmy: NO.
Steve: JUDGES SAID YES.
ONE WORD, ONE WORD.
I GET IT.
THERE'S ONLY SO MANY WORDS.
KNUCKLE, KNUCKLE.
Steve: HE'S JUST ASKING A A QUESTION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
CHUCKLE. [ BEEPING ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE GAME!
Steve: THAT'S THE GAME. 11 TO 9. OH, MY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OUR THANKS TO BENJI AND JOEL MADDEN, THE CHAMPIONS RIGHT THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BLAKE LIVELY! RACHEL MADDOW JOINS US AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: THAT'S MY JAM, JACK AND JILL. OH, THAT'S MY JAM. OUR NEXT GUEST IS HOST OF THE VERY POPULAR "RACHEL MADDOW SHOW", WHICH AIRS WEEK NIGHTS AT 9:00 P.M. ON MSNBC. SHE ALSO HOSTS MSNBC'S POLITICAL COVERAGE AND STARTING NEXT WEEK, SHE'LL COVER THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC CONVENTIONS. HERE TO TELL US ALL ABOUT THAT AND MORE, OUR PAL, RACHEL MADDOW, EVERYBODY. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. C'MON.
THAT WAS HARD.
Jimmy: IT WAS TOUGH, PASSWORDS.
YES. I KNEW WHAT THE WORD WAS AND I STILL FOUND IT DIFFICULT.
Jimmy: CHUCKLE?
CHUCKLE WAS QUESADILLA, IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT. I WOULD HAVE SAID CHALUPA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT DELIVERY. I WOULD HAVE SAID CHALUPA.
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT LONG AND HARD.
Jimmy: YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW -- QUESO KIND OF GAVE IT AWAY. I'M LIKE, OH, NO QUESO.
AND EVERYBODY WAS LIKE QUESO.
Jimmy: WELL THE GOOD NEWS IS I HAVE THE OTHER PARTNERS, MY SECRET PARTNERS, THE AUDIENCE. SO WHEN THEY -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] QUESO THEY'RE LIKE, WHOA! AND IT'S LIKE, OH, MY GOSH.
NEAR MISS.
Jimmy: EXACTLY. SO LIKE, IT WAS A GOOD HINT FROM THEM. I HAVE A LOT TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON.
Jimmy: THERE'S A LOT GOING ON. I MEAN, THE AWFUL TERRORIST ATTACK, OBVIOUSLY. IN FRANCE. DO WE KNOW ANY NEW NEWS FROM THAT OR NO?
NOT REALLY. I MEAN, THE MAIN THING THAT EVERYBODY WAS THINKING ABOUT INITIALLY WAS, WAS IT ONE PERSON ACTING ALONE, AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW AT THIS POINT, WE STILL THINK IT WAS ONE PERSON ACTING ALONE. AT LEAST THEY HAVEN'T NAMED OTHER PEOPLE. THEY ALSO WANT TO KNOW IF HE WAS EITHER DIRECTED BY OR INSPIRED BY SOME TERRORIST GROUP. THEY KNOW OF AT LEAST THUS FAR IN THE INVESTIGATION, THEY HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT ANY CONNECTIONS LIKE THAT OR ANY SIGNS THAT HE WAS RADICALIZED. HIS DAD SAYS HE WAS A LITTLE NUTS, SAID HE HAD SOME MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. I MEAN, HONESTLY, WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE PERPETRATOR. MAYBE THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT. I MEAN, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS HOW MANY PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES.
Jimmy: THAT'S AWFUL. ALSO JUST NOW BEING BROUGHT IN BECAUSE DONALD AND HILLARY ARE ACTUALLY ANNOUNCING -- THEY'RE HAVING THE -- ARE THE CONVENTIONS NEXT WEEK?
THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IS NEXT WEEK AND THEN THE DEMOCRATIC THE WEEK AFTER THAT.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE THEIR TAKES ON THIS? HAVE THEY SPOKEN OR SAID ANYTHING?
IT WAS A LITTLE -- CLINTON PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR ALLIES AND WE WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED, AND WE JUST REDOUBLE OUR EFFORT TO STAND TOGETHER, AND FIGHT THIS. YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF WHAT YOU'D EXPECT, THE SAME KIND OF STATEMENT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA PUT OUT. DONALD TRUMP WAS SUPPOSED TO ANNOUNCE HIS VICE PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE THIS MORNING. THE FIRST THING HE ANNOUNCED WAS THAT HE WAS CANCELLING THAT BECAUSE OF THE NICE ATTACK, AND THEN HE WENT AND DID A WHOLE BUNCH OF TV INTERVIEWS, WHICH WAS A WEIRD PAIR OF THINGS TO DO TO CANCEL THE THING THE NEXT DAY, BUT DO A BUNCH OF STUFF THAT NIGHT. THEN HE SAID HE WANTED NATO TO GO DO MORE TO FIGHT ISIS. HE ALSO SAYS NATO SHOULD BE DISBANDED, SO IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD FROM HIM.
Jimmy: AND HOW ABOUT BIG ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MIKE PENCE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? DO YOU KNOW MIKE PENCE?
I KNOW MIKE PENCE BECAUSE I'M A POLITICS DORK, BUT I DON'T -- MIKE PENCE GENERALLY IS NOT A A KNOWN FIGURE. SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE, LIKE, KIND OF HOW HE'S DEFINED, HOW PEOPLE GET TO KNOW HIM. I THINK THE ONE THING, IF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM BEFORE, THE ONE THING TO KNOW ABOUT HIM IS THAT THERE'S 435 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, RIGHT? WHEN HE WAS LAST IN CONGRESS, HE WAS NUMBER 428 OUT OF 435 IN TERMS OF HOW CONSERVATIVE HE IS WHEN THEY RANK THEM. IN TERMS OF LIKE THEIR CONSERVATIVE -- SO, LIKE, MICHELLE BACHMANN, YOU THINK OF HER AS BEING LIKE REALLY, REALLY RIGHT WING. HE'S MORE RIGHT WING THAN MICHELLE BACHMANN.
Jimmy: INTERESTING. AND THEN HILLARY IS LEANING -- DO WE KNOW WHO SHE'S LEANING TOWARDS? ELIZABETH WARREN?
SHE TOOK A WHOLE BUNCH OF MEETINGS WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PROSPECTS AT HER HOUSE TODAY IN WASHINGTON, SO EVERYBODY'S LIKE CREEPING OUT LIKE STAKING OUT HER HOUSE, WHICH IS ALWAYS JUST A LITTLE GROSS.
Jimmy: SLEEPOVERS, YEAH.
APPARENTLY GOVERNOR HICKENLOOPER MADE AN APPEARANCE TODAY. WHAT? I KNOW. THAT'S EXCITING. THE NICKNAME PROSPECTS ALONE FOR A VICE PRESIDENT HICKENLOOPER.
Jimmy: OH, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT. THAT'LL BE GOOD FOR US, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
ELIZABETH WARREN MADE AN APPEARANCE. ALSO, ANOTHER GOOD POTENTIAL NICKNAMER IS TOM VILSACK. THE ONLY NATIONAL FIGURE WITH SACK IN HIS NAME. HE'S BEEN THE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY FOR TWO TERMS, AND APPARENTLY HE'S IN THE RUNNING NOW.
Jimmy: NO BERNIE? BERNIE WOULDN'T BE VICE PRESDENT?
NEITHER THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN NOR BERNIE SEEMS TO THINK THAT IS A POSSIBILITY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SOME BERNIE FANS THINK IT'S NOT ONLY POSSIBLE, BUT DEFINITELY GOING TO HAPPEN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
Jimmy: NO. NOW, WHEN YOU'RE DOING THESE CONVENTIONS, THIS COVERAGE, YOU'RE GOING, I MEAN, YOU'RE ON, FOR LIKE, ALL DAY, RIGHT?
YEAH, IT'S WEIRD. I MEAN --
Jimmy: IT'S YOU, MY MAN, BRIAN WILLIAMS.
YES, WE'LL BE LIKE SORT OF AT THE HELM IN NEW YORK AND CHRIS MATTHEWS WILL BE SORT OF RUNNING THINGS FROM THE CONVENTION SITE AND WE'LL HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE IN BOTH PLACES. IT'S A LITTLE BIT WEIRD BECAUSE THEY'RE SORT OF LIKE THESE BIG INFOMERCIALS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE VERY SCRIPTED TV PROGRAMS ABOUT THE POLITICAL PARTIES. BUT WE'RE WAITING FOR SOMETHING WEIRD TO HAPPEN. IT MIGHT NOT. IT MIGHT JUST BE FIVE HOURS A A NIGHT OF THEM SHOWING US A TV SHOW, BUT SOMETIMES STUFF HAPPENS. USUALLY STUFF HAPPENS.
Jimmy: I THINK SOMETHING WEIRD MIGHT HAPPEN.
YEAH, CLINT EASTWOOD YELLED AT A CHAIR FOR AN HOUR. THAT COULD HAPPEN.
Jimmy: THAT WAS A GREAT ONE. THAT WAS A GOOD MOMENT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT WAS GOOD. BUT DO YOU GET THE TEA? DO YOU PREPARE? DO YOU STAY UP ON RED BULL? WHAT IS IT?
SO, USUALLY, ON MY -- IN MY REGULAR LIFE, I DO, LIKE, FIVE HOURS OF TV A WEEK. I DO 9:00 TO 10:00 EVERY NIGHT. THIS IS GOING TO BE -- I THINK IN THE FIRST WEEK OF THE CONVENTIONS I'M DOIONG 23 LIVE HOURS OF TELEVISION INSTEAD OF MY USUAL FIVE. SO, YOU KNOW, I TRY TO SLEEP, BUT I'M TOO EXCITED TO SLEEP. AND I TRY TO LIKE, NOT DRINK TOO MUCH COFFEE. AND THEN I JUST DRINK COFFEE ALL DAY.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT YOU GEEK OUT ABOUT THIS STUFF.
I GET SO EXCITED, I CAN'T STOP MYSELF.
Jimmy: YOU LOVE POLITICS. YEAH.
I'M THE ONE, TOO, I HAVE WEIRD EATING HABITS WHEN I'M ON THE AIR FOR THAT LONG. I'M SUPERSTITIOUS SO I ALWAYS TRY TO EAT THE LAST THING THAT I ATE WHEN I HAD A GOOD NIGHT ON TV, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY MEANS I'M STUCK ON THIS REALLY SPICY KOREAN HOT POT THAT I GOT FROM THE DELI ON 51ST STREET.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
AND NOW I LIKE HAVE TO EAT IT EVERY DAY BECAUSE I HAD A A GOOD DAY ONCE AFTER I ATE THAT.
Jimmy: SO THAT'S YOUR MOVE?
YEAH. IT'S NOT EVEN, LIKE, GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I HAVE TO EAT IT EVERY DAY.
Jimmy: YOU GOTTA DO IT. THAT'S REALLY PAINFUL.
IT'S REALLY SAD.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN ONCE WE'RE ON SET, I'M THE QUEEN OF JERKY. IN THE BASEMENT AT 30 ROCK. DID YOU EVER GO TO THE DRUGSTORE IN THE BASEMENT?
Jimmy: ME?
YEAH.
Jimmy: NO.
NO? OKAY. IF YOU DO, THEY HAVE A REALLY GOOD JERKY SECTION.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
BUT THE TURKEY JERKY IS THE BEST.
Jimmy: WELL, WE GOT YOU A A LITTLE SOMETHING, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE KIND OF NICE. WE GOT YOU A BUNCH OF JERKY TO SHARE WITH EVERYBODY. WE HEARD YOU LIKE YOUR JERKY.
OH, LOOK AT YOU!
Jimmy: ALL SORTS OF -- EVERY FLAVOR, EVERY TYPE OF JERKY EVER.
LET THE RECORD SHOW, BEEF AND OSTRICH IS A JERKY. [ LAUGHTER ] OH MY GOSH. KANGAROO?
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOOD OR NOT. THAT DOES NOT SAY KANGAROO.
YOU WANT SOME? WANT SOME KANGAROO JERKY? COME ON.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE TIME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU HAVE A KNIFE ON YOU?
Jimmy: YEAH. ALL RIGHT. OH, I THINK I GOT IT.
Jimmy: YOU DID IT.
HAVE SOME KANGAROO ON ME, BIG GUY.
Jimmy: I HAVE TO GO FIRST?
OH YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC. [ LAUGHTER ]
