"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON", OR AS ONE OF MY GUESTS IS CALLING IT, "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING DONALD TRUMP, FEATURING A GUEST APPEARANCE BY JIMMY FALLON." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE SHOULD CHANGE THE LOGO. OF COURSE, EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT TRUMP THESE DAYS. IN FACT, YESTERDAY, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE BOBBY JINDAL WAS ASKED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS THIS WEEK ON CARLY FIORINA'S APPEARANCE. CHECK OUT WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
HE SAID SOME THINGS IN "ROLLING STONE" ABOUT CARLY FIORINA THAT HAVE ATTRACTED A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THIS?
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS FOR HIM TO BE ATTACKING ANYBODY'S APPEARANCE WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOT A A SQUIRREL SITTING ON HIS HEAD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THEN, TRUMP SAID, "I'M SURPRISED HE CAN SEE ME AT ALL SINCE HE'S SO FAR BEHIND ME. [ LAUGHTER ] HE CAN'T SEE ME AT ALL." [ CHEERS ] I SAW THAT YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA AWARDED A NATIONAL MEDAL OF ARTS TO AUTHOR STEPHEN KING. YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO CAN RELATE TO A STORY OF A GUY TRAPPED IN A MANSION THAT'S DRIVING HIM INSANE, IT'S OBAMA. IT'S LIKE, "HERE'S BARRY!" [ CHEERS ] "ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES BARRY WANT A CIGARETTE." [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, THE NFL SEASON KICKED OFF LAST NIGHT WITH THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS DEFEATING THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOOD GAME. AND FOR TOM BRADY, IT WAS A A CHANCE TO PUT THE ENTIRE DEFLATEGATE SCANDAL BEHIND HIM AND JUST PLAY. BUT I'M NOT SURE HE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT.

BY DOING IT. IT JUST HAPPENS. [ APPLAUSE ] JUST BY DOING IT.
Jimmy: GENIUS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU AND THEREFORE ME ARE GENIUSES. NEXT QUESTION, YOU SAID THAT YOU'D GET MEXICO TO BUILD A A WALL AT THE BORDER. HOW DO YOU PLAN TO DO THAT?
WELL, SINCE I'M YOU, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME. [ LAUGHTER ]

YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING? THAT'S GENIUS.
Jimmy: I KNEW IT WAS. NEXT QUESTION -- YOU RECENTLY SAID, AND I QUOTE, HEDGE FUND PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF MONEY AND THEY PAY VERY LITTLE TAX. I WANT A LOWER TAX FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. HOW ELSE DO YOU PLAN TO HELP THE ECONOMY? [ LAUGHTER ]
LOOK, I'M REALLY RICH. [ APPLAUSE ] I KNOW HOW TO RUN A BUSINESS. AND I KNOW THIS, OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE WELL OFF WITH ME. SO, HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO. FIRST, WE HAVE TO CUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING. IT'S OUT OF CONTROL. TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. WE'VE GOT TO LOWER CORPORATE TAXES. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO DO BUSINESS IN THIS COUNTRY. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE GOT COMPANIES SHIPPING THOUSANDS OF JOBS OVERSEAS. THAT'S GOT TO END. AND IT'S GOING TO END. REMEMBER THAT. IT'S GOING TO END. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I'M SORRY. I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION. I WAS TOO BUSY STARING AT MY BEAUTIFUL REFLECTION. I'M LIKE A GREEK GOD THAT JUST TOOK A BATH IN A PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OKAY. ONE LAST QUESTION. AND BE HONEST. IF YOU WIN, IS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT GOING TO BE GARY BUSEY? [ LAUGHTER ]
LOOK, I LOVE GARY. HE'S FANTASTIC. BUT MORE OF A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, IN MY OPINION. [ LAUGHTER ] VICE PRESIDENT IS A VERY SERIOUS JOB. SO I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GO WITH SOMEBODY ELSE. I WOULD SAY, MAYBE, KANYE WEST. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

BY THE WAY, YOU'RE DOING A A GREAT JOB. THE RATINGS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH. I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT UP. I DON'T WANT TO START OFF SERIOUS. BUT TODAY IS SEPTEMBER 11th. I'M A NEW YORKER. YOU'RE A NEW YORKER. WHAT DOES -- WHAT DOES TODAY MEAN TO YOU?
IN A CERTAIN SENSE, IT MEANS STRENGTH. BECAUSE THE WAY THE CITY CAME BACK, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. AND THE COUNTRY CAME BACK AND THE CITY CAME BACK. THERE IS A GREAT STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE AMAZING PEOPLE. AND I THINK MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT WAS ALMOST 15 YEARS AGO.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND NOW, HERE WE ARE. I'M THE HOST OF "THE TONIGHT SHOW." AND YOU'RE THE FRONT-RUNNER -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BY FAR, FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN? [ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT?
Jimmy: WHEN DID THIS --
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO BOTH OF US. WHAT IS GOING ON?
Jimmy: FOR YOU, WHEN DID IT BECOME REAL? I MEAN, WAS IT ALWAYS REAL?
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING. MY WIFE ACTUALLY SAID TO ME, IF YOU RUN, YOU WILL WIN. SHE SEES THE REACTION. AND THE REACTION IS PEOPLE BEING TIRED IN THIS COUNTRY OF BEING RIPPED OFF, OF SEEING POOR THINGS HAPPEN. WHETHER IT'S TRADE WITH MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. WE HAVE THE WORST WRITING PACKS. WHETHER IT'S THE DEAL WITH IRAN, WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER. AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER. THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER THINGS. SO MANY THINGS THAT WE JUST AREN'T DOING. WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF OUR VETS. OUR VETS ARE SUFFERING. NEVER LIKE THIS. THE OTHER DAY, AS OF WEDNESDAY, TWO WEEKS AGO, THEY HAD THE LONGEST WAIT, JIMMY, IN THE HISTORY OF THE V.A., THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. AND THEY'D WAIT FOUR, FIVE, SIX DAYS IN A ROOM. CAN YOU IMAGINE WAITING FOR YOUR DOCTOR? I COULD NOT -- IF I'M 20 MINUTES, I'M LIKE -- I GO WILD.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THEY'RE WAITING FIVE DAYS, SIX DAYS. AND IT CAN'T HAPPEN LIKE THAT. SO PEOPLE ARE JUST TIRED OF IT. AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT -- I'M AN EFFICIENT GUY. I BUILT A GREAT COMPANY. AND NOT TO BE BRAGGING ABOUT COMPANY, BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF A MINDSET WE NEED NOW IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO BECOME RICH AGAIN AND WE'RE GOING TO BECOME GREAT AGAIN.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: DO YOU REMEMBER FEELING -- DO YOU REMEMBER FEELING THE SWAPOVER? BECAUSE AS A COMEDIAN, I COME OUT EVERY NIGHT, I HAVE TO TELL JOKES -- SORRY. BUT I HAVE TO TELL JOKES ABOUT EVERYBODY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW I MAKE FUN OF EVERYBODY. JUST TO MAKE PEOPLE --
MY HAIR.
Jimmy: NO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DON'T DO THAT. THAT'S BOBBY JINDAL. HE DOES A GREAT JOB OF THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT TO SAY, LIKE, PROBABLY EIGHT MONTHS AGO, IF I SAID YOUR NAME RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, IT WOULD GET A A LAUGH. AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU STARTED SEEING A SWITCH. AND I SAID YOUR NAME, AND PEOPLE GO -- WHAT? IF THERE WAS A REAL SWITCH. AND THE SAME THING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. EIGHT MONTHS I'D SAY, HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING IN AND SHE'S ALREADY PICKED OUT HER FURNITURE -- AND THAT WOULD GET, YOU KNOW PEOPLE, THAT'S RIGHT, SHE'S A SHOO-IN. NOW PEOPLE ARE GOING --
WELL, SHE'S HAD A VERY, VERY TOUGH TIME. AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY TOUGH FOR HER. SHE'S HAD A VERY, VERY BAD TIME. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. BUT AS FAR AS -- [ LAUGHTER ] I FEEL TERRIBLY ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, HONESTLY, HONESTLY IT'S TOUGH STUFF. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT AS FAR AS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN -- ONCE I ANNOUNCED I WAS DOING IT, NOBODY BELIEVED I WAS DOING IT.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE DOING IT.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: NOBODY DID.
YOU DIDN'T.
Jimmy: I STILL DON'T. I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU? NO I MEAN, NOW, I BELIEVE IT. I GO, OH MY GOSH HE'S -- BUT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE -- I MEAN, YOU'RE IN THE LEAD RIGHT NOW, RIGHT?
YEAH. BY A LOT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I WANT -- YOU KNOW IN SOME COUNTRIES, YOU CAN DEMAND THAT THE ELECTION BE THE FOLLOWING WEEK. I WANT -- YOU KNOW IN SOME COUNTRIES, YOU CAN DEMAND THAT THE ELECTION BE THE FOLLOWING WEEK. AND I'M DEMANDING RIGHT NOW, THAT THE ELECTION BE THIS WEEKEND. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, IT'S A LONG WAY --
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WELL IT'S SUCH A LONG WAY TO GO.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING?
I THINK THEY WANT OUR COUNTRY TO BE RESPECTED AGAIN. I THINK THEY FEEL THAT IF I'M PRESIDENT I WILL DO SOME GREAT THINGS FOR OUR COUNTRY AND WE'RE GONNA BE RESPECTED AGAIN. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SCOFFED AT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE LAUGHED AT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE BAD DEALS. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GREAT DEALS. AND I THINK THEY FEEL THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND I KNOW I'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHY -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MOVEMENT IN DALLAS. MARK CUBAN CALLED. HE SAID HE HAS THE ARENA. AND I SAID, THE ARENA? THIS WAS LIKE THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO. AND IN DALLAS, WE HAVE A A TOTALLY SOLD-OUT ARENA, 20,000 PEOPLE. AND IT JUST STARTED, IT JUST WENT UP LIKE A FEW DAYS AGO. IN ALABAMA, WE WENT TO MOBILE, ALABAMA, WE HAD 31,000 PEOPLE IN THE STADIUM. AND WE STARTED LOOKING FOR PEOPLE A FEW DAYS BEFORE, LITERALLY. IN FACT, WE WERE GOING TO A A HOTEL FOR 500 PEOPLE, AS A A FAVOR TO A FRIEND OF MINE. AND HE SAID, THIS IS CRAZY. AND WE THEN WENT TO A A CONVENTION CENTER. THAT WAS GONE. 10,000. THEN, WE WENT TO A STADIUM FOR 31. THERE'S A MOVEMENT GOING ON THAT'S AMAZING TO WATCH. AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL TO WATCH THE PEOPLE LOVE THIS COUNTRY.
Jimmy: WHAT THE HECK? [ APPLAUSE ] WHAT QUESTION DID I ASK? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I ASKED. [ LAUGHTER ]
SOMETHING.
Jimmy: DID I ASK ABOUT STADIUMS? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK YOU -- I THINK YOU ANSWERED MY QUESTION. I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT THE QUESTION WAS.
IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS MAYBE WHAT'S REFRESHING ABOUT YOU. BECAUSE, I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE OFF THE CUFF. YOU GET YOURSELF IN A LOT OF TROUBLE SOMETIMES. I THINK YOU DIG YOURSELF A A HOLE, SOMETIMES. A DEEP HOLE. AND THEN, INSTEAD OF GETTING OUT OF THE HOLE, YOU JUST DIG DEEPER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I THINK, IF YOU KEEP DIGGING, EVENTUALLY YOU MIGHT COME OUT IN CHINA AND BE THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT COULD HAPPEN.
Jimmy: BUT THIS IS THE DEBATES, ARE COMING UP, WHAT IS IT? NEXT WEDNESDAY.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: NOW, THAT'S A BIG DEAL. I MEAN LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID FOR FOX. I MEAN, HOW MANY -- I GOT TO SAY, THANK YOU, FROM THE COUNTRY -- OTHER CANDIDATES, THEY THANK YOU, FOR ALL OF THE ATTENTION YOU'RE BRINGING TO THIS PART? WHAT WAS THE -- YOU WOULD KNOW THE RATINGS?
I'M SUCH AN EXPERT.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
DOES EVERYBODY LOVE "THE APPRENTICE?" WAS THAT A GREAT SHOW? [ CHEERS APPLAUSE ] BUT, THAT HAD 24 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING. IT WAS THE LARGEST, I GUESS, THEY SAY LARGEST OR ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE HISTORY OF CABLE TELEVISION.
Jimmy: WHAT NORMALLY WOULD THEY GET AT THE DEBATE?
I WOULD A MILLION TO 2 MILLION PEOPLE. SO IT WAS 24 SO I WOULD THINK THAT I GOT 22 MILLION PEOPLE. AND I SHOULD BE PAID FOR THAT. RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. I KNOW YOU HAD A GOOD IDEA TO GIVE IT TO CHARITY. BUT THIS IS A BIG DEAL. DO YOU GET NERVOUS NOW?
WELL, I WOULD LIKE THAT. CAUSE CNN NOW, AS YOU KNOW, IS GOING TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS -- I THINK IT'S EVEN GOING TO BE LARGER THAN THAT. I SAID, WHY DON'T THEY GIVE ALL OF THE PROFITS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE? THE COMMERCIALS WENT FROM $5,000 TO $250,000. I SAID, I'D LIKE TO GIVE IT TO THE VETS. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT MONEY GO TO THE VETS. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE MONEY GO TO THE VETS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DO YOU GET NERVOUS FOR DEBATES?
A LITTLE BIT. I MEAN, LOOK, YOU DO WHAT YOU DO. I MEAN, IT IS WHAT IT IS. YOU'VE LEARNED, AND YOU'RE AN INTELLIGENT PERSON. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT ABOUT YOURSELF, OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE VERY GOOD UP THERE. THE FIRST DEBATE, I WON EVERY SINGLE POLL. WHERE THEY DID POLLS ON WHO WON THE DEBATE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I WOULD SAY I WAS NOT ASKED THE NICEST QUESTIONS. I WOULD SAY THAT THE QUESTIONS I WERE ASKED, THEY WERE A A LITTLE BIT -- IN MY OPINION --
Jimmy: A LITTLE TRICKY.
THEY WERE UNFAIR. BUT THESE ARE MINOR DETAILS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT EVERY POLL, "TIME" MAGAZINE AND DRUDGE AND EVERYBODY THAT DID A POLL. SO, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A CERTAIN ENERGY YOU HAVE TO GET. YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP THE ENERGY.
Jimmy: BUT YOU DON'T HAVE NOTES. YOU DON'T -- YOU JUST GO OUT WITH NO NOTES. I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW -- YOU JUST MAKE UP STUFF? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOW DO YOU REMEMBER -- HOW DO REMEMBER NUMBERS? HOW DO YOU REMEMBER STATS?
YOU KNOW, I'M BLESSED WITH A A GREAT MEMORY. BUT IT'S VERY INTERESTING. WHEN I SPEAK -- WHEN I SPEAK IN FRONT OF LARGE CROWDS, IF YOU ARE READING A SPEECH, IT'S MUCH EASIER, BUT YOU DON'T GET THE REACTION. WE WOULD NOT HAVE 20,000 PEOPLE IN DALLAS, AS AN EXAMPLE. YOU DON'T GET THE REACTION, A A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCH IT WAS LIVE, WHEN I DID ALABAMA. AND IT WAS REALLY -- IT WAS LIKE A LOVE FESTL. IF YOU'RE READING OR IF YOU HAVE TELEPROMPTERS, IF YOU HAVE A TELEPROMPTER OR IN ANY WAY READING A SPEECH OR EVEN LOOKING DOWN ALL THE TIME AT NOTES, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE REACTION FROM THE CROWD. SO, I GO OUT. AND I REALLY -- YOU KNOW, IT'S A RISKIER PROPOSITION. 'CAUSE WHEN YOU READ, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY MISTAKE. OTHER THAN STUMBLES. BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE ANY MISTAKE WHEN YOU DO IT JUST OFF THE CUFF, NOW I KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY. BUT IT'S A RISKIER THING. BUT IT'S A MUCH BETTER, WHEN YOU GET IT RIGHT, IT'S A THING OF BEAUTY.
Jimmy: WHO WOULD BE THE PERSON AT THE DEBATES THAT YOU'RE TARGETING? WHO IS YOUR BIGGEST THREAT?
I JUST THINK, IN TERMS OF TARGETING, ANY VOTER. THAT'S WHAT I'M TARGETING, BUT I WANT THEM TO VOTE. I WANT THEM TO LOVE TRUMP. AND I WANT THEM TO KNOW I'LL DO A GREAT JOB. AS FAR AS CANDIDATES, YOU KNOW, TO ME, THEY'RE ALL THE SAME. THEY REALLY HAVE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I HAVE TO ASK THIS, 'CAUSE I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY. HAVE YOU EVER APOLOGIZED? [ LAUGHTER ] EVER, IN YOUR LIFETIME? THINK BACK. CLOSE YOUR EYES. THINK BACK TO BABY DONALD. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE DONNIE TRUMP. DID YOU EVER, DID YOU EVER APOLOGIZE?
THIS WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS ONE CAME OUT OF --
Jimmy: NONE OF THIS.
NO, IT'S YEAH -- ACTUALLY, NONE OF THIS -- WE HAD A VERY NICE LITTLE SEQUENCE OF QUESTIONS.
Jimmy: YEAH. NO, I DON'T --
SO FAR I THINK HE SAID HE --
Jimmy: YEAH, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THOSE. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. I'M LIKE YOU NOW. I DON'T USE TELEPROMPTERS. I'M LIKE YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
MUCH BETTER.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE IN THE MIRROR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I FULLY THINK APOLOGIZING IS A GREAT THING. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WRONG. IF YOU'RE NOT WRONG. LIKE FOR INSTANCE, THEY WANTED ME -- [ LAUGHTER ] THEY WANTED ME TO APOLOGIZE WHEN I FIRST ANNOUNCED FOR PRESIDENT. THEY WANTED ME TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I BROUGHT UP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. IT TURNED OUT I TOOK SUCH HEAT FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS. DID I TAKE HEAT? BUT ULTIMATELY, IT TURNED OUT THAT I WAS RIGHT. AND NOW, PEOPLE THAT REPORTED ON ME ARE SAYING, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I MEAN, HARD TO BELIEVE. ACTUALLY REPORTERS. AND I WAS RIGHT ON IT. BUT I WILL ABSOLUTELY APOLOGIZE SOME TIME IN THE HOPEFULLY DISTANT FUTURE IF I'M EVER WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH. WE HAVE SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT. I'M GOING TO GO TO A SPEED ROUND.
GO AHEAD.
Jimmy: REALLY QUICK QUESTIONS. GIVE ME QUICK ANSWERS, PLEASE. OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO, PLEASE. YOU'RE MY GUEST. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO FIND IN HILLARY'S E-MAIL?
I THINK A LOT OF BAD STUFF. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK SO. I THINK, IT'S SOMETHING SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DOING. SHE'S GOT HER SERVER IN HER BATHROOM IN A PLACE IN DENVER. I MEAN, WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S WRONG.
Jimmy: OKAY.
YOU KNOW, GENERAL PATREAUS, BY THE WAY, BUT HE SUFFERED GREATLY BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID WHICH WAS 5% OF WHAT SHE DID. SO SOMETHING'S, SOMETHING'S VERY SERIOUSLY WRONG.
Jimmy: OKAY. KANYE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020.
KANYE HAS BEEN SO NICE TO ME, HE ALWAYS SAYS GREAT THINGS ABOUT ME. SO I LOVE KANYE. YOU KNOW I LIKE PEOPLE THAT ARE NICE TO ME, RIGHT? I MEAN, YOU KNOW I LOVE KANYE. I THINK KANYE -- KANYE IS ACTUALLY, I KNOW I'M A LITTLE BIT -- HE'S ACTUALLY A MUCH BETTER PERSON THAN SOME PEOPLE WOULD THINK.
Jimmy: YEP, I --
NOW IF HE RUNS FOR OFFICE AND IF I HAPPEN TO BE RUNNING AGAINST HIM, I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT BACK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD A WALL ALONG THE MEXICO BORDER WITHOUT IMMIGRANT LABOR?
WELL WE'RE GOING TO BUILD IT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE MAY BUILD IT WITH IMMIGRANT LABOR.
Jimmy: YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
WE MAY. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT WALL. AND IT'S GOING TO BE ACTUALLY --
Jimmy: A GREAT WALL?
CAUSE AT SOME POINT --
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD NAME.
MAYBE IT'S GONNA BE CALLED THE TRUMP WALL. WE HAVE TO MAKE --
Jimmy: THE GREAT WALL OF TRUMP. ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
WE NEED IT. WE NEED IT. WE REALLY DO NEED IT.
Jimmy: QUICK --
IT'S OUT OF CONTROL.
Jimmy: SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT CARLY FIORINA.
I THINK SHE'S A VERY NICE WOMAN. REALLY A NICE WOMAN. AM I DOING A GOOD JOB?
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT WAS -- NO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
I DON'T KNOW HER. I NEVER REALLY MET HER. SHE'S A VERY NICE WOMAN. I THINK THAT SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME. SHE HAD A VERY, VERY ROUGH PASS CORPORATELY. BUT I THINK SHE'S A VERY FINE WOMAN. AND I JUST WANT TO -- AND I SAID THAT SHE SHOULD BE ON THE MAIN STAGE AT THE DEBATE. AND SHE IS GOING TO BE.
Jimmy: SEE? YOU MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. I GOT TO SAY -- [ LIGHT APPLAUSE ] YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THE MUSIC INVOLVING YOUR CAMPAIGN. AND SO, I THINK I HAVE IT SOLVED. I THINK YOU'RE PICKING THE WRONG GENRE.
OKAY.
