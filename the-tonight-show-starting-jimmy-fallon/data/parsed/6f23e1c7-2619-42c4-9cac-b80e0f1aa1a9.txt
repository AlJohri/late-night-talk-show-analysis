Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE AN ACTUAL HOT CROWD. GUYS, WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW." MY NAME IS JIMMY FALLON, I'M THE HOST. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN TONIGHT. IT'S A GOOD ONE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, TONIGHT WAS THE START OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN PHILADELPHIA, WHERE TODAY THE TEMPERATURE WAS OVER 100 DEGREES. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] AS IF HILLARY CLINTON NEEDED ANOTHER REASON TO SWEAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHE WENT THROUGH TWO PANTSUITS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT WAS OVER 100 DEGREES ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. IN FACT, IT WAS SO HOT HILLARY MET WITH SOME BERNIE SUPPORTERS JUST FOR THE CHILLY RECEPTION. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] COOL YOU DOWN A LITTLE BIT. AND THIS DNC SCANDAL JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE. HAVE YOU HEARD THE LATEST NOW? TURNS OUT THAT THEY RIGGED IT SO HILLARY WOULD CATCH ALL THE POKEMON. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THERE'S NO WAY A SNORLAX WAS IN HER LIVING ROOM. THAT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. BUT THAT'S THE BIG STORY. THERE WERE ALMOST 20,000 DEMOCRATIC PARTY E-MAILS LEAKED OVER THE WEEKEND. ACTUALLY, PEOPLE WERE EVEN MORE SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THERE WERE 20,000 E-MAILS HILLARY HADN'T DELETED YET. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] IT TAKES A LONG TIME.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: JUST USE "SELECT ALL."
Steve: THEN THEY ALL GO AWAY.
Jimmy: SELECT ALL AND DELETE. YEAH. VERY EASY.
Steve: SELECTALL, THAT'S A A POKEMON.
Jimmy: BUT THERE'S GOOD NEWS FOR HILLARY. SHE FINALLY PICKED HER RUNNING MATE, SENATOR TIM KAINE FROM VIRGINIA. [ CHEERS ] YEAH, THERE YOU GO. THEY REALLY SEEMED TO HAVE SOME CHEMISTRY THERE. IN FACT, HILLARY JUST SHARED A A PHOTO OF THE TWO OF THEM DOING A FIRST BUMP. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] UNFORTUNATELY, THEY DIDN'T RELEASE PHOTOS OF THE FIVE OR SIX TIMES THEY MISSED THAT FIST BUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "YOU DON'T -- YOU DON'T MOVE. I'LL MOVE. YOU DON'T MOVE, I'LL COME TO YOU. JUST STARE AT MY ELBOW. LOOK AT MY ELBOW AND I'LL -- FORGET IT." [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT TIM KAINE TOOK OVER HILLARY'S INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT ON SATURDAY AS A WAY TO INTRODUCE HIM TO VOTERS AND GET THEM EXCITED. BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT KAINE CAME OFF AS EXCITING AS THEY'D HOPED. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN. TIM KAINE'S FIRST POST SAID, "EXCITED TO RUN WITH HILLARY AND MAKE SOME REAL CHANGE IN THE WORLD." THEN HE POSTED THIS PICTURE OF PLAIN TOAST WITH THE CAPTION, "HAD A DELICIOUS BREAKFAST THIS MORNING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEN HE POSTED A PICTURE WITH SOME KHAKIS WITH THE CAPTION, "NOT SURE IF I SHOULD GO WITH MY EVERYDAY KHAKIS OR MY REGULAR KHAKIS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: I'M JUST NOT SURE.
Jimmy: HE POSTED THIS PICTURE, "USING MY FAVORITE APP TODAY, THE iPHONE CLOCK." [ LAUGHTER ] KIND OF FUN APP. FINALLY, HE POSTED A PICTURE OF SARAN WRAP WITH THE CAPTION, "NOW HERE'S SOME WRAP THAT NEVER GOES OUT OF STYLE. [ LAUGHTER ] #TIMKAINEINTHEMEMBRANE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] #GETTINJIGGLYWITHIT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: GETTING JIGGLY WITH IT.
Jimmy: GETTING JIGGLY WITH IT.
Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ TIM KAINE IN THE MEMBRANE GET JIGGLY WITH IT ♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: HE SEEMS LIKE AN EXCITING GUY. TIM KAINE ALSO APPEARED WITH HILLARY AT A RALLY ON SATURDAY, AND AT ONE POINT KAINE EVEN ADDRESSED THE CROWD IN SPANISH. CHECK IT OUT. [ SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: HOLD ON, CAN WE GET SOME SUBTITLES ON THAT? [ SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AH, THAT MAKES SENSE NOW. I HEARD IT BEFORE, LIKE WHERE'D I HEAR THAT? THAT'S WHAT IT IS. HE'S DOING WELL. LAST NIGHT, HILLARY AND KAINE DID AN INTERVIEW ON "60 MINUTES" WITH SCOT PELLEY, AND I THINK HILLARY WAS HOPING PELLEY WOULD GO EASY ON HER SINCE THE CONVENTION IS THIS WEEK, BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT HAPPENED.
MADAM SECRETARY, DID YOU HEAR THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION CHANTING, "LOCK HER UP"? WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR BENGHAZI? DO YOU THINK YOU BLEW IT ON THE E-MAILS? WON'T YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS BE DEAD ON ARRIVAL AT THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES? [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHY DO YOU HATE CHRISTMAS? [ LAUGHTER ] IS A HOT DOG A SANDWICH? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, DUDE? [ APPLAUSE ] DURING THE INTERVIEW, HILLARY ALSO SAID THAT HER CAMPAIGN IS ALL HANDS ON DECK, AND SAID, QUOTE, "WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A A CRACKER JACK STAFF." YOU COULD TELL HILLARY HAS A A CRACKER JACK STAFF WHEN IT'S FILLED WITH NUTS AND DISAPPOINTING SURPRISES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "I GOT A STICKER. A TIM KAINE STICKER." OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, DONALD TRUMP JUST POSTED AN AD BRAGGING THAT 33% OF HIS SPEECH AT LAST WEEK'S REPUBLICAN CONVENTION WAS ACTUALLY APPLAUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHILE 33% OF MELANIA'S SPEECH WAS ACTUALLY MELANIA'S.
Steve: OH! [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, WHICH IS GOOD -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S NOT BAD ODDS. NOT BAD PERCENTAGES THERE. WE MAY BE SEEING MORE TRUMPS IN POLITICS. IN FACT, DONALD TRUMP'S SON, DONALD, JR., TOLD CNN HE HASN'T RULED OUT RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF NEW YORK NEXT YEAR. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WHEN SHE HEARD THAT, HILLARY CLINTON TURNED TO CHELSEA AND SAID, "CLEAR YOUR SCHEDULE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: DO IT!
Jimmy: THIS IS COOL. I SAW THAT EDDIE REDMAYNE GAVE OUT 6,500 FREE MAGIC WANDS TO THE CROWD AT HIS COMIC-CON PANEL FOR HIS UPCOMING "HARRY POTTER" SPINOFF. WHEN ASKED HOW HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE AWAY SO MANY WANDS FOR FREE, EDDIE WAS LIKE, "THEY'RE ACTUALLY JUST STICKS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] MAGIC ISN'T REAL." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: DO IT!
Jimmy: AND, FINALLY, IT SEEMS LIKE THE POKEMON GO CRAZE ISN'T SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. IN FACT, "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE SAID THAT IT'S EVEN BRINGING MORE PEOPLE TO OUR NATIONAL PARKS. WHEN ASKED IF IT WAS THEIR FIRST TIME VISITING A NATIONAL PARK, POKEMON PLAYERS WERE LIKE, "IS THAT WHERE I AM? [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T CARE, WHATEVER." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
