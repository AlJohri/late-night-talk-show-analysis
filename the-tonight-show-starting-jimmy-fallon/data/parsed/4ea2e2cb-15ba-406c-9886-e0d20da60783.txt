Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, THERE! HOT CROWD! I FEEL THE LOVE! I FEEL THE LOVE! THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. COME ON, THIS IS AWESOME! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW." AND IT'S A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. IT'S A GREAT ONE. BUT FIRST, LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. BIG POLITICAL NEWS. IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT HILLARY CLINTON WILL ANNOUNCE SHE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AT NOON ON SUNDAY. YEAH. [ CHEERS ] [ LAUGHTER ] GOD WAS LIKE, "THAT'S NORMALLY MY DAY, BUT I'M WAY TOO SCARED OF HER, SO I'LL JUST LET HER DO WHAT SHE WANTS." [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, I READ THAT SOME WOMEN ARE CONCERNED THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS USUALLY REFERRED TO BY JUST HER FIRST NAME, WHICH THEY SAY WOULDN'T HAPPEN IF SHE WERE A MALE CANDIDATE. THEY THINK IT SHOWS A LACK OF RESPECT. "ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?" SAID OPRAH, MADONNA, CHER, AND BEYONCE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOME OF THE MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE ON THE PLANET! AND REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE RAND PAUL -- OH, MAN, HE'S ALREADY -- [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S FACING SOME CRITICISM FOR APPEARING TENSE IN SEVERAL INTERVIEWS THIS PAST WEEK. BUT PAUL ADDRESSED THE ISSUE AND SAID HE'S "UNIVERSALLY SHORT-TEMPERED AND TESTY." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HE SAID, "ANYWAY, VOTE FOR ME TO RUN THE COUNTRY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT? "YEAH, I'M JUST LIKE THAT." BUT RAND PAUL, HE ADDRESSED HIS TENSE INTERVIEWS THIS WEEK AND SAID THAT HE IS "UNIVERSALLY SHORT-TEMPERED AND TESTY" AND ADDED "I THINK I SHOULD HAVE MORE PATIENCE." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HE WAS ASKED WHY HE HAD SUCH A SHORT TEMPER. AND HE SAID, "WHO KNOWS? MAYBE IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY. I'LL HAVE TO TALK TO MY PARENTS ABOUT THAT. HEH, HEH, HEH." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HE WAS ASKED WHAT HE WANTS TO DO ABOUT HIS TEMPER PROBLEM. AND HE SAID, "I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL IT A PROBLEM, BUT I'LL HAVE TO GET BETTER AT HOLDING MY TONGUE. HEH HEH." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HE WAS ASKED IF HE'LL SEEK THERAPY OR SOME COUNSELING FOR HIS RAGE ISSUES. HE SAID, "NOT TO REPEAT MYSELF BUT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH RAGE. JUST A COUPLE SLIP-UPS NOW AND THEN. SHOULD WE MOVE ON? I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE ON. HEH HEH." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HE WAS ASKED IF HE BELIEVES HIS ONGOING ANGER EPISODES WILL PREVENT HIM FROM BEING PRESIDENT AND HE SAID, "NO, IT WON'T PREVENT ME FROM BEING PRESIDENT BECAUSE I'M NOT ANGRY! I DON'T HAVE RAGE! MY TEMPER IS FINE! SO STOP ASKING ME THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY DAMN RAGE! OKAY? HUH? CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME? HUH? CAN YOU BE A GOOD LITTLE REPORTER AND SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU GET THE ANSWER YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?! OR DO I NEED TO REPEAT MYSELF?! 'CAUSE I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO THAT! LOOK, I DON'T HAVE RAGE PROBLEMS! I DON'T HAVE RAGE PROBLEMS! I DON'T HAVE RAGE PROBLEMS! SEE?! I'M DOING SUCH A GOOD JOB OF ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. I GET A GOLD STAR! GOLD STAR FOR ME!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] RAND PAUL FINALLY JUST ADDED "JUST KIDDING." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT SURE THE JOKE CAME ACROSS. THIS IS ALMOST TOO GOOD, THIS STORY HERE. CHRIS CHRISTIE, GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY. LOVE THE GUY. ONE OF OUR -- RIGHT? HE'S NICE TO US. HE'S ALWAYS COME ON THE SHOW. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT HIM.
Steve: NO.
Jimmy: I DON'T WANT TO. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEN HE GOES AND DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS. HE ACTUALLY APPEARED ON A LOCAL TALK SHOW IN NEW JERSEY THIS WEEK. THIS IS REAL. IT'S CALLED "PASTA AND POLITICS."
Steve: OH, COME ON! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO SURVIVORS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. CHRIS CHRISTIE APPEARED ON A A TALK SHOW IN NEW JERSEY CALLED "PASTA AND POLITICS." OF COURSE, WHEN HE LEFT, IT WAS JUST CALLED "POLITICS." [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, THE GOVERNOR REALLY SEEMED TO BE IN HIS ELEMENT WHILE HE WAS ON THE SHOW. TAKE A LOOK AT HIM.
GOVERNOR, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HALF A PINT OF HEAVY CREAM.

Steve: FORGET ABOUT IT. [ APPLAUSE ] DVD! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, LISTEN TO THIS. I READ THAT SCIENTISTS IN ENGLAND HAVE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS A PERSON TO ACTUALLY FEEL HOLOGRAMS BY USING ULTRASOUND. WHEN ASKED WHAT FEELING HOLOGRAMS COULD BE USED FOR, THEY WERE LIKE, "DON'T COME IN HERE! [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE BUSY DOING SCIENCE STUFF. LOCK THE DOOR! LOCK THE DOOR!" [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS COOL. BEGINNING TODAY, ALL SIX "STAR WARS" FILMS ARE AVAILABLE ON iTUNES FOR THE FIRST TIME. YEAH. AND IT COULD JUST BE ME, BUT I THINK APPLE TRIED TO SNEAK A A FEW CHANGES INTO THE MOVIES. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SCENE WITH HAN SOLO. WATCH.

Jimmy: SEE, I DON'T REMEMBER THAT IN THE FIRST TIME I SAW THAT. GUYS, THIS IS FUNNY. THERE'S A STORY ABOUT A POLICE HORSE IN FLORIDA NAMED JACOB THAT LIKES TO PAINT WHEN HE'S NOT OUT ON PATROL. [ LAUGHTER ] HE LIKES TO PAINT. THE HORSE IN THE NEXT STALL SAID "HEY, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD." AND THE COP WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, THAT ONE TALKS." [ LAUGHTER ] A MAGICAL HORSE. AND FINALLY, THIS IS GOING VIRAL. TWO GIRLS AT AN AMUSEMENT PARK IN FLORIDA WENT ON A RIDE THERE CALLED THE SLINGSHOT. AND, WELL, I THINK THEY QUICKLY REGRETTED THEIR DECISION. TAKE A LOOK.
I LOVE YOU. AND YOU ARE MY BEST FRIEND. AND IF I DIE, TELL MY MAMA I LOVE HER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: I'M SO EXCITED THAT BASEBALL SEASON'S BACK. LAST NIGHT, I WENT TO THE YANKEES GAME. I HAD A GREAT TIME. I WAS CHEERING ON ALL THE PLAYERS. AND I THINK A-ROD HATES ME. DID I TELL YOU THIS? [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T THINK HE LIKES ME. BECAUSE WE GOT GREAT SEATS AND I SEE ALL THE YANKEES COME OUT OF THE DUGOUT. THEY'LL LOOK OVER AT ME AND NOD. JETER USED TO TAKE HIS HAT AND I GO "HEY, WHAT'S UP." A-ROD COMES OUT. NOTHING. HE COMES OUT, LIKE, HITS HIS CLEATS WITH HIS BAT. AND THEN HE LOOKS AT ME, AND I GO, "WHAT'S UP?" HE DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING. AND THEN HE SWINGS HIS BAT AND GOES -- [ LAUGHTER ] DIRECT EYE CONTACT WITH MY FACE. LIKE IMAGINING MY HEAD AS THE BALL OR SOMETHING.
Steve: OH, MY GOSH.
