COMPLETES THE PACKAGE WITH THE SHOES.
Jimmy: YOU LOOK, IT'S SUBTLE -- [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, ONLY YOU COULD PULL IT OFF. ONLY YOU COULD PULL IT OFF. AND MAN, OH, MAN. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU LOOK SHARP.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND YOU LOOK -- YEAH. WHO MAKES THAT SUIT?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO MAKES IT BUT IT WAS TAILORED FOR MY BODY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OBVIOUSLY, YEAH. OBVIOUSLY, YEAH.
AND THEY NAILED IT. I'LL SHOW YOU A SWEET LITTLE DETAIL RIGHT HERE IF YOU GET CLOSE RIGHT THERE. "NEON JOE: WEREWOLF HUNTER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WOW. YOU CAN'T GET THAT EVERYWHERE, CAN YOU?
I THINK I GOT IT AT A TAILOR CALLED, "NO STONE UNTURNED." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU FOR PLAYING CATCHPHRASE. TELL YOUR DAD, I WANT TO SAY HI TO YOUR DAD. DAVID.
DAVID, YEAH VERY QUICK, HE HAD SOME SURGERY. I WANT TO SAY HI, I LOVE YOU, AND GET BETTER SOON. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. HI. [ APPLAUSE ]
IT'S A DAD THEME TONIGHT.
Jimmy: A DAD THEME TONIGHT.
DAD HASH TAGS, DADS IN THE AUDIENCE, DADS IN THE HOSPITAL.
Jimmy: DAD SHOUT-OUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
HE'S OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.
Jimmy: HE'S OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.
NOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT A A STUPID TV SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THIS. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. YOU CAME ON OUR SHOW. I LOVE HAVING YOU ON. YOU CAN COME ON WHENEVER YOU WANT TO. YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME LAUGH. YOU CAME ON AND FOR NO REASON -- FOR NO REAS-ON --
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REAS-ON.
Jimmy: THERE WAS NO REASON YOU CAME ON. YOU HAD COORS LIGHT SWEATPANTS AND HAD A NEON HAT AND A A SWEATSHIRT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I SAID WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?
YEAH, I JUST WAS -- YEAH THERE REALLY WAS NO REASON. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT WAS JUST PURELY TO AMUSE MYSELF AND DO SOMETHING STUPID FOR THE INTERVIEW AND I TOOK TWO PIECES -- I ACTUALLY OWN BOTH OF THOSE ARTICLES OF CLOTHING, THE NEON OWN THE COORS LIGHT PANTS FOR TWO SEPARATE COMEDY BITS THAT I'LL DO AROUND TOWN AT SHOWS AND JUST ARBITRARILY PAIRED THEM AND SAID, OH YEAH, I'M SAD ABOUT THIS OTHER SHOW I WAS PROMOTING BEING OVER. BUT I'M EXCITED ABOUT MY NEW SHOW IT'S CALLED, "NEON JOE: WEREWOLF HUNTER." IT WAS 100 PERCENT A JOKE.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, THAT'S TOTALLY A TRUE THING. WE WERE LAUGHING ABOUT IT, "WHAT DOES NEON JOE, DO?"
YEAH. AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. I SORT OF HAD A FEELING ADULT SWIM WOULD WATCH BECAUSE THE OTHER SHOW WAS FOR ADULT SWIM ALSO. AND I THOUGHT THEY WOULD SAY, HEY, WE SAW THAT, I KNOW IT'S A A JOKE BUT IT SOUNDS FUNNY, IT SOUNDS REALLY STUPID.
Jimmy: DID YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN?
YES, THAT'S KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED. [ LAUGHTER ] SO WE JUST SAID -- THEY SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU WRITE A SCRIPT AND SEE WHAT THAT IS?" AND I WAS LIKE, "OKAY," AND NOW HERE WE ARE TWO YEARS LATER ALMOST AND IT'S REAL.
Jimmy: NOW, IT'S A A CONSECUTIVE -- IT'S AIRING CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS, RIGHT, FROM DECEMBER 7th THROUGH THE 11th, DECEMBER 11th, MIDNIGHT. HERE'S THE COMIC BOOK OF YOU.
YEAH, WE GOT TO MAKE THIS REALLY KICK-ASS COMIC BOOK AS A A PROMOTIONAL THING.
Jimmy: DC'S NUMBER ONE. IT'S NUMBER ONE.
YEAH, IT'S LEGIT, MAN. THAT'S HOPEFULLY ONE OF MANY ISSUES --
Jimmy: OH, IT'S NUMBERED. I THOUGHT IT WAS VOTED NUMBER ONE OR SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
THEY DO THAT ON COMICS.
Jimmy: THEY DO. THIS ONE'S, LIKE, NUMBER -- IT'S LIKE, NUMBER 39. [ LAUGHTER ]
NUMBER 380. BUT NOT MINE.
Jimmy: EXACTLY. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. THAT'S YOU RIGHT THERE. THEY BASED THE COMIC OFF OF YOU. AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB. CAN I ASK WHAT THAT IS?
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE MOON? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S CALLED A MOON, JIMMY.
Jimmy: IS IT A MACHETE GUN?
OH YEAH, THAT'S MY KNIFE GUN. [ LAUGHTER ] IN CASE THE BULLET DON'T WORK, YOU GOT TO STAB. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHERE IS NEON JOE FROM IN THIS SHOW?
HE'S -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW. I DO THIS REALLY SORT OF VAGUE, LIKE, SOUTHERN CAJUN NONDESCRIPT ACCENT AND I KNOW THIS WAS NOT IN THE OUTLINE OF WHAT WE WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT. VERY QUICKLY IF THERE'S TIME FOR IT. WE WERE SHOOTING THE PILOT --
Jimmy: WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR IT.
I'M GONNA TELL IT ANYWAY.
Jimmy: WE'LL EDIT IT ALL OUT.
IT WILL BE FUN FOR THE AUDIENCE.
Jimmy: EH, ALL RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
EDIT. NEVER MIND. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE JUST SAID, I LOVE YOUR ACCENT, IT'S SPOT ON, WHATEVER IT IS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE FROM.
THAT'S GOING TO BE SWEETLY EDITED OUT.
Jimmy: NO, IT WON'T.
IT'S OKAY IF IT IS.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT.
MY DAD'S IN THE HOSPITAL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE LYING. YOU SAID HE'S OUT OF THE HOSPITAL!
HE'S IN REHAB RECOVERY. YOU CAN'T EDIT ANYTHING OUT OF MY INTERVIEW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T LIE, AND SAY YOUR DAD'S BACK IN THE HOSPITAL. HE'S OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.
HE'S OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. BUT HE'S IN RECOVERY. IT WILL HURT HIS FEELINGS IF THAT GETS CUT OUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER'S BACKSTORY.
I'LL SEND YOU PHOTOS OF HIM CRYING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHERE IS NEON JOE FROM IN THIS THING? IS HE FROM VERMONT?
NO.
THE SHOW IS SET IN VERMONT. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE NEON JOE'S FROM. HE'S SORT OF MYSTERIOUS. I DO TALK IN THAT STUPID ACCENT AS YOU'LL SEE. BUT, WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S FROM. IT'S A SMALL, FAKE TOWN CALLED GARRITY, VERMONT. WE JUST MADE THAT NAME UP.
Jimmy: AND HE HUNTS WEREWOLVES.
AND HE HUNTS WEREWOLVES, THAT IS HIS LIFE'S MISSION.
