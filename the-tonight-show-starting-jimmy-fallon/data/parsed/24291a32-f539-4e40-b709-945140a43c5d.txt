THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT'S NICE TO BE BACK ON TV AGAIN. BEEN A WHILE. YEAH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] APPRECIATE THAT. I'M A GRANDFATHER NOW. SEVERAL TIMES OVER -- [ CHEERS ]  --AND I'M REALLY HAPPY BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST WAY TO PARENT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I THINK I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT. LIKE, MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS 2 NOW AND SHE'S GOING THROUGH TERRIBLE TWOS. AND WHAT SHE DOES IS SHE COMES BY MY HOUSE AND JUST KNOCKS STUFF OVER AND SHE'S DEFIANT. SHE'LL LOOK AT ME WHEN SHE DOES IT AND THEN SHE'LL GO -- [ LAUGHTER ] "OH, WOW." AND I'M LIKE, "EMMY, DON'T DO THAT. DON'T DO IT. EMMY." "OH, WOW." [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU KNOW, I TRIED THE -- FIRM WORDS. "EMMY, EMMY -- " AND IT SCARES HER. AND SO, KIDS, I REALIZED THAT THEY RESPOND TO SILLY VOICES AND HAPPY SONGS. SO I MADE UP THIS LITTLE SONG LIKE -- [ LAUGHS ] EMMY. [ LAUGHS ] DON'T KNOCK THAT DOWN. PUT IT BACK. [ LAUGHS ] PICK THIS UP AND PUT IT BACK. [ LAUGHS ] PUT IT BACK. [ LAUGHS ] PUT IT BACK. [ LAUGHTER ]<NO VIDEO><VIDEO OK> PUT IT. PUT IT BACK LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHS ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHE LOVES THIS SONG. AND I HAVE A GRANDSON. GRANDSONS ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE GIRLS ARE SENSITIVE. YOU GOT TO WATCH HOW YOU PLAY WITH THEM. SO, I TOOK MY GRANDSON TO THE MALL AND WE'RE WALKING THROUGH THE MALL AND I FART IN HIS HAND. I HAD TO FART AND I JUST TOOK HIS HAND AND WENT -- [ LAUGHTER ] HE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING IN THE WORLD! HE'S LIKE, "DO IT AGAIN!" I'M LIKE -- HE'S LIKE, "AGAIN!" I WAS LIKE, "LOOK, I NEED TO GET SOME CHINESE FOOD. THEN, I'LL KEEP DOING IT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS ] I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY TO DO THIS TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER. SO WE'RE WALKING THROUGH THE MALL AND I FART IN HER HAND AND GO -- AND I WENT, "OH, WOW" -- AND SHE JUST FALLS DOWN AND STARTS CRYING IN THE MIDDLE -- [ IMITATES CRYING ] [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T WANT IT ON MY HAND. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M LIKE, "SORRY, BABY. I HAD TOO MUCH CHINESE FOOD." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY'RE SO SENSITIVE. LIKE LITTLE GIRLS, YOU KNOW? AND, AND THE THING IS THEY PLAY IS DIFFERENT. LIKE, MY GRANDDAUGHTER, WHEN SHE SAYS, "LOOK, PAPA. I'M GOING TO BE A PRINCESS." IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING SWEET, YOU KNOW. "I WANT TO HAVE A TEA PARTY." MY GRANDSON, IF HE SAYS, "LOOK, PAPA," THAT MEANS HE'S ON TOP OF THE ROOF, BUCK NAKED, ABOUT TO JUMP INTO THE EMPTY POOL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY JUST PLAY DIFFERENT. AND SO, I'M 54 NOW AND I'M WONDERING WHERE DID LIFE GO. YOU KNOW? AND I FIGURED OUT LIFE IS LIKE A ROLLER COASTER RIDE. AS SOON AS INNING YOU FIGURED THIS OUT, IT'S OVER. YOU KNOW HOW YOU FIRST GET ON A A ROLLER COASTER RIDE, YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING, THEY STRAP YOU IN, THEY TELL YOU "KEEP YOUR HANDS DOWN. TAKE YOUR HAT OFF. DON'T SPEED." YOU'RE LIKE, "DON'T TELL ME HOW TO RIDE MY RIDE. I'M -- I'MA BE A ASTRONAUT ON THE RIDE OF LIFE 'CAUSE I CAN FLY. I CAN WALK THROUGH WALLS. I'M INVINCIBLE." AND THEY STRAP YOU DOWN. OKAY. AND THEN THE RIDE LEAVES THE STATION. TINK, TINK, TINK, TINK -- AND IT'S ALL UPHILL AND IT'S SLOW. NOTHING GOOD HAPPENS UNTIL YOU TURN 21. IT'S JUST MORE RULES. THEY TELL YOU, "YOU CAN'T FLY. YOU CAN'T SEE THROUGH WALLS. YOU AIN'T INVISIBLE. YOU COULD EVEN -- DUCK THAT." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN YOU KEEP GOING. YOU GO THROUGH PUBERTY AND YOUR VOICE STARTS TO CHANGE AND THEN YOU GET MORE RULES. YOU CAN'T SMOKE DOPE IN YOUR MAMA'S HOUSE. YOU CAN'T HAVE SEX WITH THE NEIGHBOR NEXT DOOR EVEN THOUGH SHE WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME. JUST MORE RULES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN YOU COME UP OVER THE RIDGE, AND YOU LOOK OUT, AND THERE'S 21. THAT'S ALL YOURS. AND THE RIDE IS FAST, LIKE, "AAH!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] RIGHT? YEAH! YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT TO DO IT ALL THE TIME. LIKE PARTIES, DRUG, SEX, UH-OH, VENEREAL DISEASE. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU GO INTO THAT FIRST TURN OF HARD RESPONSIBILITIES, WHERE YOU GOT RENT, YOU'VE GOT GAS BILLS, ELECTRIC BILLS, STUDENT LOANS, AND GUESS WHAT? YOU AIN'T NO ASTRONAUT. YOU TOO DUMB TO BE AN ASTRONAUT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. YOU'RE A BUS DRIVER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THE RIDE GOES INTO THAT FIRST LOOP AND YOU COME OUT, NOW, YOU'RE 30 -- MARRIED TO SOME CHICK YOU CAN'T STAND. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GOT KIDS YOU DIDN'T WANT. BILLS YOU CAN'T PAY. STUDENT LOANS JUST PILING UP ON YOU. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT THE RIDE ACCELERATES -- VOOM! THEN YOU GO INTO ANOTHER LOOP. YOU COME OUT AND NOW YOU'RE DIVORCED. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU 40 YEARS OLD. YOUR KIDS HATES YOU AND YOU STILL GOT STUDENT LOANS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE HALFWAY POINT IN THE RIDE. YEAH. WHERE YOU'RE STARTING TO FEEL QUEASY, AND JUST WANT -- HEY, HEY, HEY. STOP THE RIDE. HEY, HEY! HEY! STOP THE RIDE. I WANT TO GET OFF. AND THE RIDE SLOWS DOWN, BUT THAT'S REALLY YOUR METABOLISM JUST SLOWING DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU START TO SEE YOURSELF LOSING HAIR. PLINK, PLINK, PLINK, PLINK -- 'CAUSE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE GOING ON THIS RIDE BACKWARDS IN LIFE. AND THEN YOU GO INTO A A BACKWARDS LOOP. AND YOU COME OUT, AND NOW, YOU'RE 55. YOU GOT BUNIONS ON YOUR FEET, A A POLYP IN YOUR ASS, A COUPLE OF PEOPLE MISSING, SOME FRIENDS ARE GONE AND YOU STILL GOT STUDENT LOANS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN THE RIDE TAKES YOU TO AN ACCELERATED MODE WHERE YOU GO INTO A DOUBLE LOOP. AND ONE OF THESE, YOU HAVE A A HEART ATTACK AND THE OTHER ONE A STROKE. THIS SIDE OF YOUR FACE IS DEAD. DON'T EVEN MOVE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DONE LOST YOUR TEETH, YOU OUTLIVED ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU'RE JUST CRANKY. YOU WANT IT TO STOP. STOP THE GOD FORSAKEN RIDE! [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE RIDE COMES TO A SLOW, JERKY STOP. AND RIGHT BEFORE YOU GET OFF, YOU GET THAT LAST STUDENT LOAN -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY GIVE YOU A PICTURE OF YOU WHEN YOU WERE 21. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
