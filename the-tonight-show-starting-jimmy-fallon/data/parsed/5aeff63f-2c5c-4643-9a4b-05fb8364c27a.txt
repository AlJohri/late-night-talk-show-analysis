TENSE NIGHT FOR QUARTERBACK JOHNNY MANZIEL. [ LAUGHTER ] ALSO KNOWN AS JOHNNY FOOTBALL THEY CALL HIM. IT WAS TENSE FOR HIM BECAUSE EVERYONE EXPECTED HIM TO GO PRETTY HIGH IN THE DRAFT. HE FELL TO NUMBER 22. AT ONE POINT THE "TODAY" SHOW WAS LIKE, "SO, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT JOHNNY FOOSBALL?" [ LAUGHTER ] SO COOL. THAT'S RIGHT JOHNNY MANZIEL FELL ALL THE WAY TO NUMBER 22. BUT AS HE WAS GETTING PASSED OVER HE GOT MESSAGES OF SUPPORT FROM HIS FANS WHILE I JUST GOT FLASHBACKS TO GYM CLASS. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] "I CAN PLAY KICKBALL TOO GUYS."

[ APPLAUSE ] AND SINCE THIS IS MY WIFE'S FIRST MOTHER'S DAY I WENT WITH MY DAUGHTER AND GOT ONE OF THOSE HAND PRINTS MADE IN CLAY. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] AND MY WIFE WAS LIKE, "THANKS, HONEY, BUT I'D RATHER HAVE THE BABY'S HAND PRINT." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M LIKE, "WELL I'M FAMOUS. SO I MEAN IT'S WORTH MORE."

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY ALSO CHANGED THEIR SLOGAN FROM "HAVE IT YOUR WAY" TO "HUNGOVER, BUDDY?" [ LAUGHTER ] OH MAN, THIS IS NOT GOOD. THE MAKERS OF KASHI CEREAL HAVE TO PAY A $5 MILLION FINE FOR MISLEADING CONSUMERS BY SAYING ITS PRODUCTS ARE "ALL NATURAL" WHEN THEY CONTAINED ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS. THEY ALSO AGREED TO STOP MISLEADING CONSUMERS BY LABELING MULCH AS CEREAL. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN PLANT PLANTS IN IT. WHATEVER. EAT IT. WE DON'T CARE.

Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEY'LL GET THEM NEXT YEAR. NOW DO YOU THINK AMERICAN FANS ARE DIFFERENT THAN BRITISH FANS?
YEAH. I THINK -- WELL, THE THING THAT I THINK -- WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT AMERICAN SPORTS IS IT'S KIND OF FOOD BASED.
Jimmy: FOOD BASED?
IT'S FOOD BASED, YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT LASTS FOUR HOURS, SO YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH TIME FOR AN EIGHT COURSE MEAL.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU DO.
AND THERE IS -- THERE IS AN ENOUGH FOOD ON FOR ALL EIGHT COURSES. AND ALSO YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DRINK WITHIN THE STADIUM AS WELL.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHEREAS AT HOME, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DRINK. YOU'D GET THROWN OUT. AND IF YOU DID DRINK IN THE STADIUMS AT HOME, I THINK IT'D BE A BLOOD BATH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU TELLING ME YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DRINK DURING BRITISH SOCCER GAMES?
NO, IT'D GET TOO VIOLENT. AND IT'S TOO KIND OF CRAZY.
Jimmy: BUT THEY SEEM LIKE THEY'RE DRUNK. [ LAUGHTER ]
YES, THAT'S TRUE. BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DRINK, WHAT HAPPENS IS -- YOU KNOW -- IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO DO IT LIKE AMERICANS. IN BRITAIN, PEOPLE WOULD GO TO THE PUB BEFORE THE GAME, SPEND HALF AN HOUR DRINKING EIGHT PINTS -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN TURN UP TO THE GAME AND BE LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN GO HOME, PASS OUT AND THEN, NOT BE ABLE TO REMEMBER THE GAME THE NEXT DAY. SO MAYBE WE SHOULD ALLOW DRINKING DURING THE MATCH.

Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, YOU KNOW, ON THESE BIG MOVIES YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF DOWN TIME. IT'S ALL VERY MUCH HURRY UP, HURRY UP, HURRY UP, NOW WAIT FOR EIGHT HOURS. SO NICK HOULT AND I WENT TO CANADIAN TIRE AND BOUGHT LIKE TEN BB GUNS AND GAVE ONE TO JEN LAWRENCE AND ONE TO HUGH AND ONE TO MICHAEL.

Jimmy: SHE PROBABLY DESERVED IT. I DON'T KNOW.
SOME OF THE STUFF SHE DID WAS FULL ON, I TELL YOU.

AH, I THINK TRICKY WOULD BE TO DO IT A DISSERVICE. I WOULD SAY SOPHISTICATED.
Jimmy: AH! HEY, THAT'S VERY NICE. IT WAS VERY SOPHISTICATED THIS PLOT.
