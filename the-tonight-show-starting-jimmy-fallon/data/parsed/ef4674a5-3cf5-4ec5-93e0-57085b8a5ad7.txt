Questlove: 273!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY! THAT'S A GREAT CROWD RIGHT THERE! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYONE TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU. STRAIGHT OUT OF NEW YORK CITY. WELCOME, WELCOME. I AM YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON AND I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT EVERYONE IN TONIGHT'S AUDIENCE IS GOING HOME WITH A BRIBE FROM FIFA! ISN'T THAT GREAT? YEAH, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. HERE'S THE LATEST ON THAT BIG SOCCER SCANDAL. I SAW THAT FORMER FIFA EXECUTIVE CHUCK BLAZER -- THAT'S A COOL NAME, HUH. HEY, CHUCK BLAZER, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FIFA EXECUTIVE CHUCK BLAZER HAS ADMITTED TO ACCEPTING BRIBES IN 2013. YEAH. CAN WE SEE CHUCK BLAZER FOR A A SECOND? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH WHEN HE HAS TO GIVE HIMSELF COAL FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S TOUGH. YOU HATE TO SEE IT HAPPEN. YOU HATE TO SEE IT GO DOWN LIKE THAT. LET'S GET TO THE ELECTION HERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JOINING THE RACE RIGHT NOW. INCLUDING FORMER GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND, LINCOLN CHAFEE, WHO IS CHALLENGING HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. NOW, DURING HIS ANNOUNCEMENT, HE SAID, "I REALIZE THAT I'M NOT THAT WELL KNOWN. I DON'T HAVE A TON OF SUPPORT. I'M LIMITED ON FUNDS. WHY AM I DOING THIS AGAIN?" [ LAUGHTER ] WHY? DID I LOOSE A BET OR SOMETHING? ACTUALLY, DURING HIS ANNOUNCEMENT, CHAFEE SAID, "IT WOULD HELP OUR ECONOMY IF WE EMBRACED THE METRIC SYSTEM." FINALLY ANSWERING THE QUESTION, WHAT'S THE WORLD'S WORST CAMPAIGN SLOGAN? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE, BRING BACK THE METRIC SYSTEM! [ APPLAUSE ] RIGHT? BRING IT BACK. KILOGRAMS! BRING BACK THE DEWEY DECIMAL -- OH WE NEVER -- OH, NEVER MIND. DOESN'T MATTER! AND IN CASE YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH LINCOLN CHAFEE, HERE'S SOME VIDEO OF HIM. I THINK HE'S JUST A -- HE LOOKS LIKE A NICE GUY, LIKE A A PEACEFUL GENTLEMAN. I LIKE HIM. HERE'S A VIDEO OF HIM MAKING HIS ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY.
WE HAVE TO FIND WAY TO WAGE PEACE.
Jimmy: HE SEEMS PRETTY CONFIDENT. HE'S A SWEET GUY. BUT, MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK HE HAS A SHOT AGAINST HILLARY. EVEN HIS SHADOW DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AGAIN. WATCH THE REST OF IT.
I WOULD REPAIR RELATIONS WITH VENEZUELA, BOLIVIA AND ECUADOR. [ LAUGHTER ] THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK IS DETERIORATING AND BECOMING DANGEROUS.
Jimmy: CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?
Steve: THAT'S RUDE.
Jimmy: MAYBE HE'S PETER PAN. [ LAUGHTER ] HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT THOUGH. SHE IS RAISING A LOT OF MONEY. IN FACT, HILLARY IS HEADING BACK TO L.A. TO GO TO A A FUNDRAISER HOSTED BY HBO'S PRESIDENT OF PROGRAMS. THE EVENT ISN'T FOR A FEW MORE WEEKS, BUT THEY'VE ALREADY RELEASED A SEATING CHART. HILLARY WILL BE SITTING HERE, IN THIS CHAIR. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN EVERYONE ELSE CAN SIT WHERE EVER THEY WANT. DOESN'T MATTER. THEY CAN FIGHT OVER IT. AND OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE TODAY, FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AND I READ THAT GROWING UP, HE WANTED TO BE A VETERINARIAN, BUT HIS GRADES WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LUCKILY FOR US, NOW HE WANTS TO BE IN CHARGE OF PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THAT'S GREAT. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, FOUR YEARS AFTER HIS FIRST PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, RICK PERRY HAS OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED HIS SECOND BID FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. AND THIS TIME PERRY SEEMS DEAD SET ON WINNING. HE'S SERIOUS. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. HE SAID, "IF WE'RE GOING TO REVIVE THIS AMERICAN DREAM AGAIN WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO PROVIDES LEADERSHIP." [ LAUGHTER ] PERRY WENT ON TO SAY, "SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN TESTED -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- AND A PRESIDENT WHO TELLS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE TRUTH." FINALLY, PERRY SAID, "BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE HONEST." [ LAUGHTER ] "LIKE, SAY, IF YOU SEE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS WHO'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT START TO SHOVE A A CORNDOG INTO HIS MOUTH WITH A A BUNCH OF CAMERAS AROUND, THEN MAYBE SAY SOMETHING, LIKE, 'HEY RICK, NOW'S NOT A GREAT TIME TO EAT A CORNDOG. PUT IT DOWN NOW.'" [ APPLAUSE ] DON'T DO IT. THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS TO EAT AT THE FAIR.
Steve: FRIED OREOS.
Jimmy: YEAH, FRIED OREOS AND FRIED DOUGH.
Steve: ANYTHING.
Jimmy: DRINK A SODA, ANYTHING. YEAH, YOU DON'T NEED TO --
Steve: DON'T CORNDOG IT UP.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT GOOD.
Jimmy: CORN ON THE COB.
Steve: SURE.
Jimmy: IF YOU EAT IT HORIZONTALLY.
Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, LOUISIANA GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL IS EXPECTED TO BE THE 11th REPUBLICAN TO ANNOUNCE WHETHER OR NOT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON JUNE 24th IN NEW ORLEANS. HE WANTED TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT EARLIER, BUT THAT'S HOW LONG IT TAKES HIM TO WALK TO THE MICROPHONE. WATCH THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
GOOD EVENING AND HAPPY MARDI GRAS.
Jimmy: WHY DID HE START -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HI, I'M BOBBY JINDAL, GOOD EVENING. START CLOSER. START CLOSER. THIS IS COOL. I SAW THAT IN HONOR OF ITS 40th ANNIVERSARY, THE MOVIE "JAWS" IS HEADING BACK TO SELECT THEATERS LATER THIS MONTH. [ CHEERS ] YEAH. YOU CAN TELL IT'S BEEN UPDATED, BECAUSE BEFORE EATING SWIMMERS, JAWS ASKS IF THEY CONTAIN ANY GLUTEN. AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, THE MOVIE "JAWS" IS HEADING BACK TO THEATERS TO CELEBRATE ITS 40th ANNIVERSARY. ALSO, BECAUSE STEVEN SPIELBERG WAS APPARENTLY SITTING ON HIS YACHT RECENTLY AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF, "I'M GOING TO NEED A A BIGGER BOAT." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, I READ THAT POLICE IN SPAIN RECENTLY SEIZED 441 POUNDS OF COCAINE THAT WAS HIDDEN INSIDE HOLLOWED OUT PINEAPPLES. I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS THIS.
I'M READY! I'M READY. I'M READY. I'M READY. I'M READY. I'M READY. I'M READY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

Steve: TRYING TO SHOW YOU UP.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. BUT, IT'S FOR PRE-ORDER NOW. IT'S GOOD FOR FATHER'S DAY. OH, I SHOULD SHOW YOU THE ENDING. EVERYBODY WANTS THE KID TO SAY, "DADA" AT THE END. MIGUEL ORDONEZ DREW THESE AWESOME DRAWINGS OF THE CUTE ANIMALS. EVERYBODY GET IN LINE AND SAY IT ONE MORE TIME AND THEY ALL SAY, "DADA." [ AUDIENCE AWS ] EXCEPT FOR THE DUCK. HE SAYS "QUACK." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: IT'S A BABY DUCK. ANYWAY, THIS BOOK IS $115. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: PRE-ORDER? [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: FOR PRE-ORDER, $115. IF YOU WANT IT BEFORE ANYONE ELSE, IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE.
Steve: RIGHT, YEAH. 115 BUCKS.
Jimmy: DID I SAY 115?
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: $150. I DID NOT PRONOUNCE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] GO TO DADATHEBOOK. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT IS TO BE HONEST. $16.99.

Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. FOR EVERY INTERVIEW YOU DO, I SHOULD SAY ALSO, BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BRIAN WILSON. BUT I FOLLOWED YOUR INTERVIEWS TOO, AND I READ STUFF ABOUT YOU.

Jimmy: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT IT.
Jimmy: WHAT A SUBJECT BETTER THAN BRIAN WILSON AND THE BEACH BOYS.
HE'S BEEN ON THE SHOW BUNCH?
Jimmy: HE'S BEEN ON OUR SHOW PROBABLY, AT LEAST TWICE. AND LAST TIME HE CAME ON, OR ONE OF THE LAST TIMES HE CAME ON, HE BROUGHT JEFF BECK AND THEY PLAYED AN INSTRUMENTAL VERSION OF "DANNY BOY" BECAUSE I'M IRISH.
ME TOO.
Jimmy: COOL. [ LAUGHTER ] AND MAN, HE JUST -- HONESTLY, I REMEMBER HIM PLAYING THAT AND IT ALMOST FELT LIKE THE ROOM WAS JUST FLOATING. IT FELT LIKE THE SONG WAS JUST KIND OF FLOATING OUT THERE. I DON'T KNOW, IF THAT DESCRIBES IT RIGHT. I GOT REALLY NERDY AND GOT INTO THE PET SOUNDS SESSIONS AND THE SMILE.
SMILE SESSIONS. YEAH. THOSE ARE INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: I MEAN IT'S JUST, IT'S MIND BLOWING AND HOW I THINK. AND I READ BOOKS ABOUT HIM TOO. GOSH, WHAT A WEIRD LIFE, AN INTERESTING LIFE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS HIS DAD THAT AFFECTED THE WAY HE THINKS. HIS DAD WAS REALLY WAS HARD ON HIM. LIKE, INSANELY.
HE HAD A ROUGH, ROUGH GO OF IT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT BRIAN WAS DOING. YOU HAVE TO THINK, ALL RIGHT WELL. TRY TO THINK OF A TIME WHEN THE BEATLES DIDN'T EXIST. WHEN THE BEACH BOYS DIDN'T EXIST. WHEN, BEFORE ROCK 'N' ROLL HAPPENED AND NO ONE HAD PUT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC AND MIXED IT WITH POP. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO BRIAN AND SORT OF PHIL SPECTOR AND BEACH BOYS AND THE BEATLES.
Jimmy: IN THE MOVIE, ALSO PORTRAYED BY PAUL DANNO. WHO'S FANTASTIC IN THIS, AS WELL AS YOU. AND YOU SEE WHERE THEY STARTED AND HOW HE IS INSPIRED BY THE FOUR FRESHMEN.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND YOU JUST SEE HOW IT'S JUST A TRICKY TIME IN THE '60s AND DRUGS, AND THEN EVENTUALLY AS HE GETS -- AND HIS DAD IS JUST ROUGH ON HIM. AND THEN HIS BRAIN IS JUST MOVING FASTER THAN A SPEEDING TRAIN, A SPEEDING BULLET. AND THEN YOU KIND OF PICK UP, LATER ON IN LIFE, WHERE HE MEETS THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE WHICH IS AN AMAZING --
IT'S JUST -- PLAYED BY ELIZABETH BANKS.
Jimmy: THE FANTASTIC ELIZABETH BANKS, BUT YOU SEE THAT STORY AND YOU GO "GOOD FOR HIM THAT HE GOT TO SEE SOMEONE --"
I GOT A CHANCE TO -- IT WAS A LITTLE TRICKY TO MAKE A FILM ABOUT BRIAN WILSON, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, HE'S ALIVE, AND HE'S STILL TOURING AND HE'S AWESOME. AND YOU GO "OH, GOD IF WE SCREW THIS UP."
Jimmy: HI, I'M YOU. YEAH.
THIS IS REALLY GOING TO SUCK. AND IF PAUL DOES A GREAT JOB AND I SCREW IT UP, IT'S REALLY GOING TO SUCK.
Jimmy: I KNOW, IT WORKS PERFECT TOGETHER. YOU GOT TO HANG OUT WITH HIM?
GOT TO HANG OUT WITH HIM. WE WALKED UP INTO HIS HOUSE. YOU KNOW, IT WAS GREAT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S LIKE, DOGS RUNNING AROUND AND KIDS AND THERE'S LIKE, OH, HI. BRIAN'S UPSTAIRS. GO UPSTAIRS. AND I SORT OF WALKED UP, AND I MET HIM. HE GOT THROUGH IT ALL. HE GOT THROUGH ALL THE HARD TIMES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
