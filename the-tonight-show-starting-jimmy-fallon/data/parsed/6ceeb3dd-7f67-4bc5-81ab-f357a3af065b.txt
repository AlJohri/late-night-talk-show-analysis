I'M PRETTY GOOD WITH A BOW. I THINK I MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT A A LITTLE CLIP FOR YOU TO SEE. I WAS IN JAPAN. AND THEY ASKED ME WOULD YOU RATHER MAKE SUSHI OR DO CALLIGRAPHY OR DO A LONGBOW? AND I DID THE LONGBOW.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS IT FOR?
FOR A JAPANESE TALK SHOW. AND WHILE WE WERE DOING IT, YOU KNOW, THEY SHOW US HOW TO DO IT LIKE REAL CLOSE UP. THEN AT ONE POINT --
Jimmy: WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE? IS THIS LIKE A NERF GUN? NERF BOW?
NO. LIKE A SEVEN-FOOT LONGBOW. RIGHT? AND THEN THE TARGET IS ABOUT THIS BIG. AND I WENT TO ABOUT THE LENGTH OF A BASKETBALL COURT AND --
Jimmy: I WOULD HAVE MADE SUSHI RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
