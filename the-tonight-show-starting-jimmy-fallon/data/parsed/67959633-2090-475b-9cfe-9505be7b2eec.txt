Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: OH, I LOVE IT. OH, WELCOME. [ CHEERS ] IT'S A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. LAST NIGHT WAS THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IN NEVADA. AND DONALD TRUMP SCORED A BIG VICTORY, BRINGING HIM ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. YEP. THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY IS GETTING VERY REAL RIGHT NOW. [ CHEERS ] IT'S GETTING SO REAL, MEXICO IS STARTING TO THINK A WALL IS A A PRETTY GREAT IDEA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE LIKE, "JUST PUT IT UP. WE'LL PAY FOR IT. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH -- I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. WE WANT TO BE ON THIS SIDE OF IT." THAT'S RIGHT, DONALD TRUMP WON HIS THIRD STATE LAST NIGHT. IN FACT, HE GOT MORE VOTES THAN MARCO RUBIO AND TED CRUZ COMBINED. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] IT WAS SO BAD, AFTERWARDS, RUBIO AND CRUZ STOPPED FIGHTING AND JUST STARTED HOLDING EACH OTHER. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ OH MY LOVE MY DARLING ♪
Jimmy: YEAH. THEY'RE MAKING POTTERY. I DON'T KNOW WHY. AFTER WINNING IN NEVADA, TRUMP WAS TALKING TO THE CROWD. AND HE'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHEN HE CAN PRETTY MUCH SAY ANYTHING. JUST CHECK OUT WHAT HE SAID TO HIS OWN SUPPORTERS.
WE WON WITH POORLY EDUCATED. I LOVE THE POORLY EDUCATED. [ CHEERS ] WE'RE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE. WE'RE THE MOST LOYAL PEOPLE. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU CAN HEAR PEOPLE ARE CHEERING, THEY'RE LIKE, "YEAH! WAIT, WHAT? WHAT DID HE -- [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU, RIGHT?" THAT EXPLAINS HIS EDUCATION POLICY, EVERY CHILD LEFT ALONE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] DID YOU SEE THIS? DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT IF ELECTED PRESIDENT, HE'D LOOK INTO PROSECUTING HILLARY CLINTON FOR USING HER PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER. SO, IF TRUMP WINS, HILLARY WILL ALREADY BE ON TRIAL FOR MURDERING HER ENTIRE CAMPAIGN STAFF. [ LAUGHTER ] "HOW DID YOU LET THIS HAPPEN?" [ APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE, AFTER FINISHING A A DISTANT SECOND IN NEVADA, MARCO RUBIO APPARENTLY WENT TO BED AS THE RESULTS WERE STILL COMING IN.

NEW YORK CITY, BUNCH OF BEST FRIENDS, WHO -- WHERE ONE OF THEM SORT OF MAKES IT. AND THE REST OF 'EM DON'T.
Jimmy: OOH.
AND THEY'RE SORT OF FIGURIN' OUT WHAT'S NEXT IN THEIR LIVES.
Jimmy: YOU ALWAYS DO TRICKY STUFF HERE. LIKE, "THANK GOD FOR JOKES." CONGRATS ON THIS.
THANKS.
Jimmy: THIS JUST EXTENDED FOR 11 MORE WEEKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: AT LYNN REDGRAVE THEATER.
YEAH. IT'S ALL --
Jimmy: CONGRATS ON THAT.
THANKS. YEAH, IT'S A SHOW THAT I WROTE ALL ABOUT JOKES AND HOW THEY GET YOU IN TROUBLE. AND HOW THEY MAKE US CLOSER TO EACH OTHER. HOW THEY BOND US.
Jimmy: YEAH. I LOVE THIS STORY ABOUT YOU GETTING ARRESTED.
OH, YEAH. SO, I TELL THIS STORY.
Jimmy: IT'S A GOOD ONE.
IT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IN THE SHOW I TELL A STORY ABOUT HOW I -- WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT, I WAS ON THE ROAD, I WAS DRIVING MY MOM'S STATION WAGON AROUND THE COUNTRY TO AREAS OF LESSER COMEDY CONCENTRATION. OHIO, WEST VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY. BY THE WAY, I BOUGHT MY MOM'S CAR. I FOUND OUT RECENTLY, SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE'S PARENTS HAVE FAITH IN THEIR CHILD'S DREAM, THEY'LL GIVE THEM THEIR CAR. [ LAUGHTER ] AND MY MOM GOT --
Jimmy: SHE CHARGED YOU FOR IT.
MY MOM, SHE GOT THE FULL BLUE BOOK VALUE. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S LIKE, THIS CAR JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT.
Jimmy: THAT WAS NICE OF HER.
YEAH. I REMEMBER THERE WAS THIS ROCK-BOTTOM POINT WHERE I WAS DRIVING BACK FROM A COMEDY CLUB IN NEW JERSEY TO MY AIR MATTRESS IN QUEENS. AND I'M COMING ON THE RAMP. IT'S TRUE. I WAS SO BROKE. WHEN YOU'RE BROKE, EVERYTHING IS LOW TO THE GROUND. YOU KNOW, YOU ROLL OFF YOUR AIR MATTRESS IN THE MORNING. YOU GRAB SOME PANTS FROM A A FLOOR. YOU COOK NOODLES ON A HOT PLATE. ONE FALLS OUT OF YOUR MOUTH YOU'RE LIKE, IT'S NOT TOO FAR. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, THE ONLY WAY TO GET LOWER IS IF YOU DIED. AND SO, REMEMBER THIS ROCK BOTTOM POINT, I'M DRIVING DOWN THE RAMP TO THE LINCOLN TUNNEL. AND THIS COP JUST POINTS AT ME AND WAVES ME OVER. WHEN YOU'RE BROKE, COPS WILL PULL YOU OVER JUST IF YOU HAVE A CRAPPY CAR. JUST SEE WHAT ELSE YOU GOT GOIN' WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Jimmy: THAT'S SO NICE OF THEM. THAT'S SO NICE OF THEM.
LIKE, "YOU, COME HERE. WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT WHICH LAWS YOU'VE BROKEN."
Jimmy: WE'RE NOT SURE YET.
SO, HE SAYS LICENSE AND REGISTRATION. I PULL OUT MY LICENSE AND I REALIZE IT'S EXPIRED BY THREE WEEKS. I HAD THAT MOMENT WHERE I THINK, SHOULD I PREFACE THIS CONVERSATION WITH THIS KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION? YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
JUST LIKE, SAME TEAM, WE BOTH THINK I'M AN IDIOT. [ LAUGHTER ] HE GOES TO THE CRUISER. HE'S THERE FOR TEN MINUTES 'CAUSE THERE'S A LOT TO DO. AND THEN WHEN HE COMES BACK, HE SAYS, DID YOU KNOW YOUR LICENSE IS SUSPENDED? I DIDN'T KNOW -- I WAS VERY NAIVE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SUSPENDED MEANT. SO, I SAID TO HIM, I QUOTE. I SAID, "YES. NO. [ LAUGHTER ] WAIT. WHAT'S SUSPENDED?"
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S GOOD, YEAH. YES, NO, WAIT. WHAT'S SUSPENDED?
AND HE SAID, PLEASE STEP OUT OF THE CAR. I GO, "NO, I'M SERIOUS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT SUSPENDED MEANS." THINKING WE WERE HAVING A WITTY WHITE PERSONS REPARTEE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE SAYS, "PLEASE STEP OUT OF THE CAR." I GET OUT OF THE CAR. HE SAYS, "YOU'RE UNDER ARREST." AND I SAID, "NO, I DON'T THINK SO." [ LAUGHTER ] HE SAYS, "I'M SURE OF IT." AND THEN, HE CUFFS ME, WHICH PROVES THE WHOLE THING. AND YEAH. WHAT'S CRAZY IS THAT, IT'S -- I ASK EVERY NIGHT IN THE AUDIENCE, IF ANYONE'S BEEN ARRESTED.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND THEY ANSWER YOU.
WELL, YEAH. WELL, WHAT'S AMAZING IS EVERYONE ALWAYS HAS EUPHEMISMS FOR WHEN THEY GET ARRESTED. PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY, "BASICALLY, I GOT A DUI." [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH MEANS, YOU GOT A DUI.
Jimmy: YOU GOT A DUI, YEAH, YEAH. OH, WELL, BASICALLY I GOT --
ACCORDING TO THEM, I MURDERED SOMEONE. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE SORT OF, KIND OF, THEY THOUGHT A BLANK SITUATION IS KIND OF IS ALWAYS A COMMON ONE. PEOPLE WILL SAY, I HAD A DUI SITUATION.
Jimmy: I GOTTA WHOLE SITUATION.
JUST ADD THE SITUATION TO A A CRIME.
Jimmy: BUT WHAT IF YOU -- HAVE YOU EVER LIKE RECOGNIZED SOMEBODY IN THE AUDIENCE AND THEY ANSWER YOU?
THE OTHER NIGHT, RACHEL MADDOW WAS IN THE AUDIENCE.
Jimmy: OH.
AND IF YOU COME TO THE SHOW YOU'LL SEE IT'S AN INTIMATE SHOW. IT'S LIKE, IT'S 250 PEOPLE IN A A ROOM SO WE CAN ALL KIND OF SEE EACH OTHER. AND I SAID, HAS ANYBODY BEEN ARRESTED? AND SHE APPLAUDED. AND I COULD SEE HER AND I HAD THIS ETHICAL DILEMMA. LIKE, WAIT. I KNOW THAT'S RACHEL MADDOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SHOULD I PRESS THIS FURTHER? AND I WAS LIKE, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, OF COURSE.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO.
I SHOULD ASK HER. AND SO, WHAT WERE YOU ARRESTED FOR? SHE SAID -- SHE SAID, IT WAS FOR A PROTEST. SHE SAID, BUT I GOT ARRESTED ON PURPOSE. WHICH IS VERY CONVENIENT. [ LAUGHTER ] I FEEL LIKE IF I'M EVER ARRESTED FOR ANYTHING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I'M GONNA JUST -- I'M GONNA FRAME IT THAT WAY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT WAS ON PURPOSE.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE. YEAH, I MEANT TO DO THIS.
THE GUY ON "MAKING A A MURDERER" SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH THAT. YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
ON PURPOSE.
Jimmy: THIS IS TOTALLY ON PURPOSE, YOUR HONOR.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT CASINO WERE YOU IN?
OH, YEAH. I HAD ONE THAT WAS REALLY BAD. I WAS AT MOHEGAN SUN CASINO.. AND I WAS PERFORMING. AND IT WAS GOING, LIKE, NOT GREAT. THIS IS A LOT OF YEARS AGO. WHEN I WAS TERRIBLE. I MEAN, I'M GREAT NOW. I MEAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S SO HUMBLE OF YOU. YEAH.
NO, IT WAS BAD. IT WAS GOING BAD AND THESE TWO -- TWO COUPLES IN THE FRONT ROW. AND THEY LOOKED LIKE THE GUYS WERE TOUGH. LIKE MAYBE LIKE ORGANIZED CRIMINALS OF SOME KIND OF AND THEY WERE WITH THEIR DATES. AND THEY JUST KEPT TALKING DURING THE SHOW. LIKE, THEY JUST WOULDN'T STOP. AND I DON'T, YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE LIKE HECKLER LINES. LIKE, I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE, COMICS WHO'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T SHOW UP AT YOUR JOB AND DO IT POORLY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LINES ARE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT WAS A GOOD ONE. YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
I DON'T HAVE LINES LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: THAT WAS A GREAT ONE. WELL, NOW YOU DO. I DON'T SHOW UP WHERE YOU'RE WORKIN' AND DO THAT THING.
AND DO IT NOT AS WELL.
Jimmy: YEAH. NOT AS WELL.
AS OTHERS.
Jimmy: YEAH. SO, THEY'RE TALKING DURING THE SHOW.
AND I GO, HEY, MAYBE YOU GUYS SHOULD LEAVE WITH YOUR DATES, WHO I IMPLIED WERE HOOKERS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M DEAD WRONG IN THIS SITUATION. BUT I IMPLIED -- I MEAN, I SAID, "MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEAVE WITH YOUR HOOKERS." [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, HERE'S WHERE THERE'S SO MANY REASONS WHY THIS IS A BAD IDEA.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WELL, TWO. YOU KNOW, THERE'S ONLY TWO POSSIBLE SCENARIOS IN THIS INSTANCE. ONE IS THAT THEY ARE HOOKERS.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S TRUE. YEAH. I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT. YEAH.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THEY ARE OR THEY AREN'T.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IF THEY AREN'T, IT'S OFFENSIVE. 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY GOT DRESSED UP. THEY'RE LIKE, OH, WE'RE GOING OUT WITH THESE GUYS WHO MIGHT BE MOBSTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THEY -- SOME PERSON WHATEVER SAYS AN INSULTING THING. AND THEN IF THEY AREN'T -- IF THEY ARE HOOKERS, IT'S INSULTING. 'CAUSE I THINK PART OF THE MAGIC OF BEING A GREAT HOOKER -- [ LAUGHTER ] IS IT'S SORT OF  IT'S THE EFFORTLESS QUALITY.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIKE, IS THAT EVEN A HOOKER? WHO CARES? SO, I SAY THIS. THE GUY LOOKS -- THE ONE GUY LOOKS AT ME DEAD IN THE EYE. LIKE, DARK, BLACK EYES. THIS IS HOW I REMEMBER IT. AND HE GOES, I'M GONNA -- CAN I CURSE? IT'S WHAT HE SAID.
Jimmy: SURE.
WE'LL BLEEP IT. I'LL DO BOTH. I'LL DO A VERSION OF BOTH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
HE GOES, I'M GONNA [ BLEEP ] KILL YOU.
Jimmy: YEAH, OKAY. GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVE THAT THAT CAMERA GOT IT. I DIDN'T EVEN BLOCK YOUR MOUTH.
I LOVE THAT --
Jimmy: I BLOCKED YOUR MOUTH HERE.
I LOVE THAT THIS IS THE LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY WE'RE WORKING WITH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE MERV GRIFFIN SHOW."
Jimmy: "THE MERV GRIFFIN SHOW."
HE GOES, "I'M GONNA KILL YOU."
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THAT WASN'T A JOKE AT ALL.
Jimmy: NO.
NO ONE WAS LAUGHING.
Jimmy: NO.
I DEFINITELY WASN'T LAUGHING. I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW MAYBE I COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MIDDLE SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. YEAH, THAT'S PERFECT FOR YOU.
YOU GUYS, YOU'VE GOTTA LISTEN TO THE END. YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO THE END. MY BROTHER, JOE, AND I WERE PLAYING BLACKJACK LATER THAT NIGHT. MY BROTHER JOE WAS LIKE, "MIKE, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU CAN'T CALL PEOPLE'S WIVES HOOKERS." AND I GO, "I KNOW. I WAS THERE ALSO." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THESE TWO WOMEN CAME OVER TO THE BLACKJACK TABLE, I SWEAR THIS IS TRUE. AND THEY SAID, YOU GUYS LOOKING FOR DATES? WELL GUESS WHAT? IT WAS THE SAME TWO WOMEN FROM THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU WERE RIGHT! YOU WERE RIGHT!
AND THEY WERE HOOKERS!
Jimmy: YES! YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY THAT! YOU WERE RIGHT THE WHOLE TIME!
AND AS WE HAD SEX WITH THOSE HOOKERS.
