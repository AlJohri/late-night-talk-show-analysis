WELL --
Jimmy: THIS WAS A VIRAL MOMENT.
THAT'S VERY NICE. WELL, WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THIS IDEA. JENNI KONNER AND LENA DUNHAM HAD TALKED TO ME ABOUT THIS IDEA, THAT WHAT IF ELIJAH WAS AUDITIONING FOR MUSICALS. SO, WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT SORT OF MY EARLY LIFE IN NEW YORK AUDITIONING FOR MUSICALS. BECAUSE, I HAD A GOOD, LIKE, TEN YEARS OF TRYING OUT FOR STUFF THAT I SOMETIMES WOULD GET, MOSTLY DID NOT. AND I TOLD THEM A STORY ABOUT AUDITIONING FOR THIS MUSICAL "LYSISTRATA JONES" THAT THEN CAME TO BROADWAY, BUT IT INVOLVED LIKE A COLLEGE BASKETBALL TEAM. AND MUCH LIKE HAPPENED IN LAST WEEK'S EPISODE, LIKE, I SHOWED UP AND I SANG AND THAT ALL WENT FINE. AND THEN I READ, AND THAT ALL WENT FINE. AND THEN WE STARTED DANCING, WHICH IS LIKE ALWAYS A LITTLE DICEY FOR ME BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY A DANCER. BUT I LIKE MADE IT THROUGH. AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE, "AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE BASKETBALLS." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE IT'S A BASKETBALL MUSICAL. SO THEY LIKE WHEELED OUT THESE CARTS OF BASKETBALLS. BUT I WAS THINKING LIKE, "WHATEVER, IT'S A MUSICAL. SO LIKE, WHO IS GOING TO BE GOOD AT BASKETBALL IN THIS ROOM?" [ LAUGHTER ] TURNS OUT ALL THOSE BASTARDS HAD LIKE SECRET BASKETBALL SKILLS. EVERYBODY WAS LIKE TWIRLING BALLS AND LIKE DOING [ BLEEP ]. I WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE IN MUSICAL THEATER. WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD AT SPORTS." [ LAUGHTER ] WHY --
Jimmy: YOU DON'T PLAY SPORTS.
WHY IS ANYONE GOOD AT SPORTS? [ LAUGHTER ] SO THEN I WAS TERRIBLE AT IT.
Jimmy: WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO DANCE WITH THE BASKETBALL?
YES, IT WAS A DISASTER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO WHAT -- LIKE I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WOULD DO.
IT WAS JUST LIKE, DRIBBLING AND DOING PASSES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND LIKE --
Jimmy: THEY DON'T CALL IT PASSES.
LIKE THINGS.
Jimmy: THEY UM --
NO?
Jimmy: NO.
OH, OKAY. LIKE A SHOT.
Jimmy: LET'S JUST CALL IT PASSES.
SHOTS!
Jimmy: YEAH.
SHOTS AND THINGS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
STRANGELY, I GOT THAT JOB, THOUGH.
Jimmy: YOU GOT CAST?
YEAH, I STILL GOT CAST IN IT.
Jimmy: NO WAY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH, I DID.
Jimmy: IT WAS YOUR CHARM -- IT WAS YOUR TALENT THAT GOT YOU CAST.
I THINK IT DID. AND THEN -- BUT IN THE SHOW ONCE I WAS DOING IT, THERE WAS LIKE THE PEAK OF THE SECOND ACT WAS THIS BASKETBALL GAME THAT HAD TO HAPPEN ON STAGE. WHICH WAS VERY LIKE, YOU KNOW, THEATRICALIZED, BUT IT INVOLVED ME MAKING, LIKE, THREE BASKETS THAT WERE PLOT POINTS THAT I HAD TO BE LIKE -- KA-KUNG. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I PROBABLY LIKE FOUR -- FOUR SHOWS OUT OF EIGHT WOULD MAKE THE BASKETS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT THE SCOREBOARD HAD TO CHANGE ANYWAY BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE A PLOT POINT. SO I'D BE LIKE, "OOF." AND THEN IT WOULD NOT GO IN AND THEN IT WOULD BE LIKE, "SCORE!" [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE AUDIENCE WAS LIKE, "WAIT, WHAT?"
Jimmy: WAIT, WHAT?
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW? AND I WAS WORRIED --
Jimmy: LIKE, THIS IS A PLAY, EVERYBODY.
IT'S A PLAY, JUST LIKE LIGHTEN UP.
Jimmy: GO WITH IT. YEAH.
MY FRIEND PATTI MURIN WAS ALSO -- SHE WAS IN THE SHOW WITH ME AND SHE WOULD MAKE EVERY BASKET, LIKE EVERY NIGHT. AND I WAS LIKE, "HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?" HOW DOES ANYONE EVER MAKE A A BASKET? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. KA-KUNK. I MEAN -- [ LAUGHTER ]
RIGHT, YEAH. THAT'S MY FORM.
Jimmy: THAT'S -- THAT'S ALL YOU NEED, MAN.
THAT'S WHY IT DIDN'T GO WELL?
Jimmy: BUT THIS THING ON "GIRLS," YOU SANG A SONG -- IS IT A SONG FROM "SMASH?"
IT SURE AS HELL IS. IT IS A SONG FROM THE NBC'S "SMASH" AND I -- WELL, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LIKE, WHAT ELIJAH SHOULD SING FOR HIS AUDITIONS. WE WERE LIKE -- WE KICKED AROUND A COUPLE OF IDEAS. AND THEN I WAS LIKE, "WHY ARE WE EVEN WASTING TIME? I SHOULD JUST SING 'LET ME BE YOUR STAR' FROM THE HIT SHOW 'SMASH.'" [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: AND YOU KNOW -- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? I MEAN JUST 'CAUSE --
WELL BECAUSE LIKE, COMING FROM THAT BROADWAY WORLD, LIKE I KNOW ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE --
