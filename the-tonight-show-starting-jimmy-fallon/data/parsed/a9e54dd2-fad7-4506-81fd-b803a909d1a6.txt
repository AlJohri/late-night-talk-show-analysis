I SAW THE ONE WITH NATALIE PORTMAN AND HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN. [ LAUGHTER ] DOES THAT COUNT? [ LAUGHTER ] SO LISTEN. SO THIS IS WHAT RYAN DID. HE FELT THE SAME, AND HE SAID -- THE NIGHT BEFORE I STARTED SHOOTING WITH HIM, HE GOES LIKE, "I WENT TO DINNER WITH HARRISON."
Jimmy: HAVING NO IDEA HIS PAST IN FILM.
HE WAS THE DUDE WITH THE EARRING, THAT WAS MARRIED TO CALISTA FLOCKHART, WHICH WAS AWESOME. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS LIKE --
Jimmy: YOU'RE SO YOUNG, YOU'RE SO YOUNG. BUT I WAS REALLY COOL OTHER THAN THAT. YOU KNOW, I JUST LIKE DIDN'T REALLY CARE. AND THEN I WATCHED ALL THREE "INDIANA JONES" MOVIES THE NIGHT BEFORE SHOOTING.
Jimmy: WAS THAT A GOOD IDEA?
NO. HE RIDES ON A HELICOPTER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT'S LITERALLY HOW HE GETS TO WORK EVERY DAY.

Jimmy: YEAH, HE DOESN'T HAVE A HAT AND A WHIP, BUT STILL IT WOULD BE COOL IF HE DID.
IN MY HEAD, HE DOES.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
I JUST LIKE TO HAVE THE WHOLE FANTASY.
Jimmy: BUT, CAN YOU DO SCENES WITH HIM AND YOU'RE ACTING -- ACT LIKE YOU'RE NOT ACTING WITH INDIANA JONES?
I THOUGHT, "OKAY, FOR THE FEW WEEKS THAT WE'RE SHOOTING, I'M JUST NOT GONNA SAY 'INDIANA JONES,'" AND EVERY OTHER WORD'S LIKE, "INDIANA JONES, INDIANA JONES" IN MY HEAD. AND THEN I THOUGHT, "OKAY, AT THE END OF THE FIRST DAY, IT'S BEEN LONG ENOUGH. IT'S BEEN A FEW HOURS, THAT'S KIND OF LIKE THREE WEEKS, BUT DIFFERENT."
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]O TALK TO ME ABOUT IT FOR SOME REASON. I JUST FELT IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT "INDIANA JONES"?
FOR SURE. ABOUT IT IN THIRTY YEARS, I SAW ALL THREE THE NIGHT BEFORE, SO HE WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, SURE. AND SO I SORT OF -- I CORNERED -- AND HE HAD ALREADY INVITED ME TO HAVE A RIDE HOME ON HIS HELICOPTER. SO LIKE, I WAS IN, AND I WENT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT. AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT SCENE WHEN YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN A SWORD FIGHT AND THEN YOU PULLED OUT THE GUN AND YOU WERE LIKE --" AND HE JUST STTO" Y EL ME.
Jimmy: ONCE YOU'RE IN THE HELICOPTER, YOU'RE LIKE -- [ SHOUTING ] "THAT SCENE WHERE YOU WERE IN A A FIGHT WITH A GUY WITH A GUN!"
WE WERE ABOUT TO BE IN THE HELICOPTER.
Jimmy: WE'RE GOING TO LAND, WE'RE GOING TO LAND, EMERGENCY LANDING.
NO, THAT WOULD HAVE ENDED VERY TERRIBLY. NO, BUT SO WE WERE ABOUT TO GET IN. WE HADN'T GOTTEN IN YET. AND THEN YOU KNOW, I JUST KEPT TALKING TO HIM AND HE WASN'T FINDING THOSE SCENES EXCITING. AND I THOUGHT MAYBE IT JUST DIDN'T JOG HIS MEMORY, YOU KNOW? AND SO I WAS LIKE, "AND THEN SEAN CONNERY!" AND THEN I REALIZED I SOUNDED LIKE CHER AND NOT LIKE SEAN CONNERY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS JUST AWFUL.
Jimmy: IT'S A DISASTER.
YEAH, AND LIKE THE -- MY ELBOWS STARTED LOOKING LIKE NIGERIAN SPEED-WALKERS, AND I WATCHED THE CREW. I'M LIKE, "WHAT IS HAPPENING?" I'M JUST -- I'M FLOATING IN THE CORNER.
Jimmy: A MELTDOWN.
OH, IT WAS AWFUL. AND THEN I GOT HOME, MY HUSBAND WAS LIKE, "YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO IGNORE HIM NOW." SO I GOT TO WORK THE NEXT DAY AND I LIKE, "WHAT'S UP?" [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST TRIED TO PLAY IT COOL. HE MUST JUST THINK I HAVE SOME SORT OF MAJOR DISORDER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DID YOU END UP MAKING FRIENDS? ARE YOU COOL NOW?
THE WHOLE THING IS YOU'VE GOT TO GET INVITED AGAIN. LIKE, YOU GOT THE GOLDEN TICKET TAKEN AWAY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU GUYS DO THAT FOR US.
Jimmy: SO ARE YOU GOING TO SEE HIM AT THE PREMIERE? DID YOU ALREADY HAVE THE PREMIERE?
NO. I THINK HE'S AVOIDING ME. I THINK THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST A ROUSE TO AVOID ME.
Jimmy: SO YOU HAVEN'T RUN INTO HARRISON FORD AT ALL, AND YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE THEN FILM?
NO. NO, NO, I HAVEN'T. BUT I THINK HE'S JUST INTIMIDATED BY ME IS PROBABLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EXACTLY. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
YEAH, HE WATCHED ALL OF THE "SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS" FILMS. AND HE'S LIKE, "AND THEN THE THING WITH THE JEANS."
Jimmy: I LOVE THEM. YEAH, EVERYONE WEARS THE SAME JEANS. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. I DO. I DO IT WITH THE WRITERS. ME AND THE WRITERS SWAP PANTS ALL THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY, THOUGH.
Jimmy: THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY, THOUGH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT THE IDEA OF THE MOVIE IS THIS. SO YOU'RE -- "THE AGE OF ADELINE." YOU'RE ADELINE, YOU'RE FOREVER 29 YEARS OLD.
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?
Jimmy: I LOVE THIS. I'M IN. I LOVE MOVIES LIKE THIS. SO YOU'RE 29 YEARS OLD, SO YOU DON'T AGE.
NO. SHE GETS INTO A CAR ACCIDENT. AND SO THERE'S A SORT OF A A MAGICAL LEAP YOU HAVE TO TAKE AS AN AUDIENCE. BUT SHE GETS INTO A CAR ACCIDENT AND SHE NEVER AGES. AND SO SHE GETS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE WANTS. SHE HAS ETERNAL YOUTH, BUT YOU GET TO SEE THE PEOPLE AROUND HER AGE, AND HER DAUGHTER, WHO'S 82 YEARS OLD. AND YOU GET TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF THAT.
Jimmy: LOVE IT.
YEAH, WHEN YOU'VE BEEN ALIVE FOR A LONG TIME, MAYBE CERTAIN LIVES CAN INTERSECT, AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW IN YOUR PAST MIGHT COME, YOU KNOW, INTO THE PRESENT.
Jimmy: SPOILER ALERT. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST THINK IT'S GREAT. I LOVE MOVIES LIKE THAT. IT'S A MOVIE. IT'S LIKE, YOU WANT TO SEE A A REALLY GOOD STORY, AND IT'S ROMANTIC, AND IT'S GOOD. I LOVE IT. I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP, HERE'S BLAKE LIVELY IN "THE AGE OF ADELINE." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

Jimmy: -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I WANT TO SAY SINGING AGAIN. I NEVER HEARD THE WORD SINGING AGAIN. GOSH! SINGING IS IN MY HEAD. MY GOODNESS.
COME ON.
Jimmy: SQUASH.
THAT. SORRY, SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST REALLY WANT TO MAKE THE TAPE LAST. HOLD ON. SORRY. THERE WE GO.
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
AND NOW, YOU LOOK LIKE WILLIAM SHATNER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: FOR THOSE THAT DON'T RECOGNIZE ME I PLAYED THE GIMP IN "PULP FICTION." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS ALSO THE END OF THIS GAME, BUT WHO KNOWS. HERE WE GO. YOU GO FIRST. READY, GO.
WHO.
FALL.
WHAT?
GLISTEN.
WHEN?
TALL.
BLUE.
BUILDING.
WHERE?
COAT.
DOG?
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT FAIR! YOU WON, YOU WON, YOU WON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE YOU GO. ♪♪
I DID STUTTER ON DOG, SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CHEAT.
Jimmy: NO, NO. I THINK YOU WON. LET'S GET A GOOD ONE RIGHT HERE.
WHY DID I GET SO MUCH TAPE AGAIN? I'M REALLY LIKE, TAPE HUNGRY.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ] PERFECT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BLAKE LIVELY, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH BRIAN GRAZER! THERE HE IS, IN THE XBOX GREEN ROOM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WE'RE JOINED RIGHT NOW BY AN OSCAR AND EMMY AWARD WINNING PRODUCER, HE IS THE MAN BEHIND SO MANY UNFORGETTABLE MOVIES AND TV SHOWS. HE ALSO HAS A NEW BOOK OUT CALLED, "A CURIOUS MIND: THE SECRET TO A BIGGER LIFE." PLEASE WELCOME, A FRIEND OF THE SHOW, HERE'S BRIAN GRAZER EVERYBODY. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANKS FOR COMING BACK TO SEE US. LAST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT ALL THE GREAT MOVIES YOU'VE DONE, AND TV STUFF. BUT I'VE GOT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON "EMPIRE" BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THE BIGGEST SHOW, THAT EVER -- CONGRATS TO THE WHOLE TEAM OVER AT "EMPIRE," WHAT A GREAT SHOW. IT COULDN'T BE BIGGER AND CRAZIER, I CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON TWO. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS, "A CURIOUS MIND." I LOVED IT, COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.
THANK YOU, JIMMY. I'VE KNOWN YOU AWHILE. YOU'VE KNOWN I DONE THIS LITTLE DISCIPLINE FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: BUT I DIDN'T KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU STARTED AND HOW -- I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU AND HOW YOU STARTED. BUT THE IDEA OF JUST BEING CURIOUS, YOU WERE ALWAYS A A CURIOUS KID.
WELL I WAS ALWAYS A CURIOUS KID. BUT I HAD THIS TINY LITTLE GRANDMOTHER, MY LITTLE GRANDMA SONYA. MY GRANDMA SONYA WAS ABOUT THIS TALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TWO FEET, YEAH.
SHE WAS A LITTLE TALLER THAN THIS. BUT, I WAS 5 YEARS-OLD, AND SHE SAID TO ME, "BRIAN, YOU'RE SPECIAL. YOU'RE GOING TO BE A SPECIAL KID." AND I GO, "WHY, GRANDMA?" AND SHE SAID, "WELL BECAUSE OF YOUR CURIOSITY. CURIOSITY IS GOING TO BE YOUR SUPER POWER. YOU ARE GOING TO DO SO WELL WITH THIS. JUST KEEP ACTIVE WITH YOUR CURIOSITY." AND I'M LITERALLY LOOKING AT MY REPORT CARD. MY REPORT CARD IS ALL Fs. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THERE WAS LITERALLY, NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT I WAS GOING TO BE SPECIAL AT ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT MY LITTLE GRANDMA SONYA, SHE VALIDATED MY CURIOSITY AND I KEPT ASKING QUESTIONS AND I GOT MYSELF THROUGH COLLEGE AND OUT OF COLLEGE. I CONTINUED THIS DISCIPLINE THAT'S SYNTHESIZED IN THIS BOOK WHERE I MEET A NEW PERSON EVERY TWO WEEKS NOW FOR ALMOST 35 YEARS, I'M PLANNING ON DOING IT THE REST OF MY LIFE. AND IT'S, THEY'RE EXPERTS IN SCIENCE, MEDICINE, TECHNOLOGY, ATHLETICS, ALL ART FORMS AND I JUST KEEP DOING IT EVERY TWO WEEKS.
Jimmy: AND THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH YOU JUST MEETING WITH THEM AND TALKING TO YOU -- JUST, LIKE, STRANGERS? WHEN YOU STARTED, IT'S FASCINATING TO READ, BECAUSE YOU GO, "THIS IS HOW YOU GOT STARTED IN THE BUSINESS." YOU WOULD JUST CALL PEOPLE AND GO, "HEY, COULD I JUST HAVE FIVE MINUTES?"
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH. I MEAN, I STARTED WITH PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS, BUT I NEVER HAD AN "ASK." SO IN OTHER WORDS, I WOULD ASK TO HAVE THE FIVE MINUTES, BUT THE PROMISE WAS THAT I WASN'T GOING TO ASK FOR A JOB.
Jimmy: RIGHT.
SO IN ANY OF THOSE YEARS OF DOING IT I'VE NEVER ASKED FOR ANYTHING. THEY KNOW THEY'RE SAFE. I'M JUST TRYING TO CREATE TRUST AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WHICH WILL CREATE INTIMACY AND WE'LL BOTH HOPEFULLY LEARN SOMETHING FROM IT.
Jimmy: YEAH. THERE IS A QUOTE HERE THAT I LIKE. IT'S FROM DOROTHY PARKER, I BELIEVE. IT'S LIKE, "THE CURE TO BOREDOM IS CURIOSITY."
YEAH.
Jimmy: 'CAUSE YOU CAN NEVER BE BORED. KIDS GO, "I'M BORED, I'M BORED." FIGURE OUT SOMETHING TO DO.
ASK A QUESTION, ASK A A QUESTION OF A SUBJECT, JUST BE ACTIVE. SO YOU HAVE NO REAL FEAR IN LIFE IF YOU CONTINUE TO BE CURIOUS. BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO PROPEL YOU THROUGH LIFE, IT'S GOING TO BRING YOU A BIGGER WORLD. AND IN MY CASE, IT'S INTERSECTED WITH THE NARRATIVE FORM OF MOVIES AND TELEVISION. BUT IT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY. WHAT -- I THINK THIS IS A GOOD GIFT, I THINK, ALSO FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO UNLEASH THIS POWER. EVERYONE CAN DO THIS STUFF. BUT ALSO I THINK AROUND NOW, IT'S A GOOD GRADUATION GIFT.
WOW, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: FOR KIDS, BECAUSE, YOU'RE GOING OUT IN THE WORLD. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. THIS IS A GOOD -- IT'S A BUMP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
AND YOU CAN START, I MEAN, ANYONE THAT READS THIS OR JUST DECIDES TO DO THIS DISCIPLINE CAN DO IT IMMEDIATELY. IT DOESN'T TAKE A YEAR OR AN HOUR. I MEAN, YOU CAN JUST GO RIGHT -- THAT SECOND YOU CAN GET GOING.
Jimmy: TONIGHT, RIGHT NOW. GO TALK TO SOMEBODY YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO. A STRANGER, WHY NOT.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: DON'T TALK TO STRANGERS. BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] I GOTTA SAY, THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, I HEARD THIS STORY ABOUT YOU. THAT YOU CARRY AROUND THESE LITTLE PHOTOS OF YOURSELF AND WHEN YOU GO TO A PARTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR YOU'RE HANGING OUT, YOU WILL JUST DROP THIS PHOTO SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE, AND PEOPLE WILL FIND IT AND YOU DID IT TO ME. [ LAUGHTER ] THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE I WENT IN MY DRESSING ROOM, I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE A PHOTO OF IT.
OH MY GOD.
Jimmy: I DON'T HAVE A PHOTO OF IT. IT'S IN MY DRESSING ROOM STILL TO THIS DAY, 'CAUSE I LOVE IT. AND IT'S A PICTURE OF YOU SMILING IN A TINY LITTLE HEART FRAME. AND IT'S THERE. AND I GO, I CAN'T BELIEVE HE GOT ME. THE MOST FUNNIEST THING EVER, AND I LAUGHED SO HARD. DO I, OH I HAVE IT. HERE IT IS, SORRY.
OH, MY GOD, YOU KEPT IT! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: MY FAVORITE THING EVER. I LOVED IT SO MUCH. MY FAVORITE THING EVER, I THANK YOU SO MUCH. I LOVE IT SO MUCH, I KEPT IT IN MY DRESSING ROOM, IT ALWAYS MAKES ME LAUGH. AND THEN I FIGURED, YOU WERE IN EUROPE PROMOTING THIS BOOK "THE CURIOUS MIND." AND YOU WEREN'T AROUND, SO I HAVE A PHOTO OF ME IN A HEART FRAME.
OH MY GOD.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW, DOES THIS LOOK FAMILIAR AT ALL? DOES THIS LOCATION LOOK?
OH, MY --
Jimmy: IS THAT YOUR OFFICE AND YOUR DESK?
THAT'S MY OFFICE AND MY DESK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I HAD SOMEBODY HELP ME OUT WITH THIS.
OH, MY GOD.
Jimmy: IS THIS YOUR OSCAR?
THAT'S MY OSCAR.
Jimmy: THAT'S YOUR OSCAR, THERE.
OH MY GOD.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND THAT'S YOUR BATHTUB, IS THAT YOUR BATHTUB? [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY HOW MANY THERE ARE. THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AND THERE'S LESS THAN TEN. I CAN'T WAIT. YOU GOT TO FIND ALL OF THEM, BUDDY. THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. I LOVE YOU, MAN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BRIAN GRAZER! CHECK OUT HIS NEW BOOK, "A CURIOUS MIND." IT'S AVAILABLE NOW. WE HAVE STAND-UP FROM NATE BARGATZE AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND EVERYBODY, COME ON BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WE ARE SO EXCITED TO HAVE THIS HILARIOUS STAND-UP BACK ON THE SHOW. HIS NEW COMEDY CENTRAL SPECIAL, "NATE BARGATZE: FULL TIME MAGIC", DEBUTS ON SATURDAY, MAY 2nd. AND THE ALBUM IS AVAILABLE FOR PREORDER ON iTUNES TODAY. PLEASE GIVE A WARM WELCOME TO ONE OF OUR FAVORITE COMEDIANS, NATE BARGATZE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GUYS, DON'T FEEL BAD. I WILL NOT EVEN BE WATCHING MY SPECIAL ON MAY 2nd. I WILL WATCH THE FIGHT. SO, DON'T EVEN -- LET'S ALL DVR IT. YOU KNOW? I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE. I'M MARRIED AND STUFF, AND THAT'S FINE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M ALSO -- I'M FROM NASHVILLE. ME AND MY WIFE, WE WERE IN NASHVILLE LAST SUMMER, AND WE WENT OUT ON THE LAKE WITH SOME OF OUR FRIENDS. AND WE WERE FLOATING AROUND IN THE WATER. THERE WAS A GUY IN A BOAT RIGHT NEXT TO US. AND MY WIFE SAYS, "OH, THAT'S MY EX-BOYFRIEND IN THAT BOAT." I DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE WAS, YOU KNOW? SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. SHE WAS JUST BASICALLY LIKE, "YOU HAVING FUN? BECAUSE I CAN PUT A STOP TO THAT, AND MAKE YOU STARE -- [ LAUGHTER ] MAKE YOU STARE AT THIS GUY THE REST OF THE DAY." [ LAUGHTER ] SO I'M LIKE STARING AT HIM, AND THEN I LOOK AT HER, AND SHE'S STARING AT HIM. AND I FEEL LIKE SHE'S STARING AT HIM TO SEE WHAT HER LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF SHE DIDN'T MARRY ME. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I STARTED STARING AT HIM, BECAUSE LIKE, I WANT TO SEE WHAT MY LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF I DIDN'T MARRY HER. [ LAUGHTER ] WE WERE PUTTING SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THIS GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE STARED AT HIM FOR A A WHILE. HE DID NOTHING EXCITING. WE BASICALLY BOTH JUST REALIZED WE DON'T HAVE A BOAT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT MY FRIENDS WERE LIKE, "YOU SHOULD HAVE WENT AND TRIED TO FIGHT HIM. LIKE, WHY DON'T YOU GO FIGHT HIM?" AND I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE WOULD HAVE TO SWIM OVER TO THAT FIGHT." [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW HOW INTIMIDATING THAT IS FOR A GUY TO SEE A HEAD IN A LIFE JACKET FLOATING HIS WAY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, I GOT TO GET IN THE BOAT. LIKE, YOU EVER TRIED TO CLIMB INTO A BOAT FROM WATER? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT AGGRESSIVE. IT TAKES AN HOUR IF NO ONE IS IN THE BOAT. I WOULD NEED HIS HELP. THAT'S HOW THE FIGHT WOULD START. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. WE HAVE A 2-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AS WELL. WE JUST TOOK HER TO DISNEY WORLD FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND PEOPLE JUST LIKE -- THEY'RE LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE TAKING HER. SHE'S NOT GOING TO REMEMBER IT. JUST WASTING MONEY. IT'S LIKE DUMB." I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW, SHE LIKE BELIEVES IN THAT STUFF. YOU KNOW, IT'S EXCITING TO SEE HER EXCITED." WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, SHOULD I JUST LOCK HER IN A A CLOSET AND BE LIKE, "DO YOU REMEMBER YESTERDAY? NO? [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, UNTIL YOU START REMEMBERING THINGS, I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE ANY MONEY ON YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW? I'M -- IT'S EXCITING. IT'S EXCITING TO HAVE A KID. I'M EXCITED, LIKE, FOR HER WHEN SHE GOES TO SCHOOL. LIKE, I'M GOING TO DO A LOT OF HOMEWORK WITH HER. AND IT'S MOSTLY JUST BECAUSE I COULD USE ANOTHER RUN-THROUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] OF ALL THE GRADES, LITERALLY EVERY GRADE. I AM PRETTY DUMB. MY FIRST -- HERE'S THE PROOF, IF YOU NEED PROOF. MY FIRST JOB, WHEN I WAS 15, I WORKED AT -- NASHVILLE USED TO HAVE A THEME PARK CALLED OPRYLAND THEME PARK. AND I WORKED THERE, AND ONE DAY, I WAS EATING LUNCH, AND THIS COUPLE SITS DOWN. AND WE MEET EACH OTHER, AND I WAS LIKE, "HEY, I'M NATE." AND THE GUY GOES, "MY NAME IS JOHN, THIS IS MY WIFE JANE, AND OUR LAST NAME IS DOE." [ LAUGHTER ] SO THEY'RE LIKE, "WE'RE JOHN AND JANE DOE." AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] BLOWN AWAY. I WAS LIKE, "ARE YOU SERIOUS, DUDE? IT JUST WORKED OUT LIKE THAT?" I WAS LIKE, "CAN YOU EVEN DO THAT?" HE'S LIKE, "WE'RE DOING IT." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S UNREAL HOW MANY PEOPLE I HAVE TOLD I MET JOHN AND JANE DOE. AND RECENTLY, I'M 35, I WAS DRIVING, AND I JUST STARTED THINKING ABOUT JOHN AND JANE DOE. AND I WAS LIKE, "AH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I BET THEY WERE LYING TO ME ABOUT THAT." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW LONG IT TOOK. 20 YEARS FOR ME TO CATCH ON. [ LAUGHTER ] I TRIED TO GOOGLE THEM STILL, TOO. I LITERALLY TRIED TO LOOK THEM UP. MAYBE THEY WEREN'T LYING, YOU KNOW? AND TURNS OUT THEY WERE MURDERED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND -- YEAH. THEY STILL -- YOU KNOW -- STILL DON'T KNOW WHO DID IT. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR LYING TO A 15-YEAR-OLD KID. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK IF I COULD TIME TRAVEL, IF I COULD GO BACK IN TIME, KNOWING EVERYTHING I KNOW NOW, I DON'T THINK I WOULD MAKE A A DIFFERENCE. I LITERALLY DON'T THINK YOU GUYS WOULD HEAR ABOUT IT. I WOULD GET STUCK. IF I WENT BACK TO LIKE THE 1920's AND SAW SOME GUY ON AN OLD PHONE. I'D BE LIKE, "HEY, VINCI, THEY HAVE PHONES YOU JUST CARRY IN YOUR POCKET." AND HE'D BE LIKE, "YEAH, HOW DO THEY DO IT?" YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK IT'S A SATELLITE OR SOMETHING. AND HE'S LIKE, "WHAT'S A A SATELLITE?" "WELL, I SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BROUGHT THAT UP." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN -- IT'S LIKE -- LIKE A A ROUND METAL DISH THAT CAN GO PRETTY HIGH IN THE AIR. I HONESTLY DON'T THINK I COULD PROVE I'M FROM THE FUTURE. [ LAUGHTER ] I LITERALLY -- THEY WOULD WANT SOME PROOF, YOU KNOW. JUST LIKE, "WHO'S THE NEXT PRESIDENT?" "OH, BOY." [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU GUYS, SO MUCH. YOU GUYS ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
