THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT. THIS IS AWESOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. CONGRATS ON ALL THE AWARDS AND THE GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATION. I SAW THIS MOVIE, AND I FREAKED OUT. WE HAD TO CALL YOU. I WAS LIKE, "PLEASE CAN WE HAVE HIM ON THE SHOW?" MAN, OH, MAN, IT WAS JUST ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFORMANCES I HAVE EVER SEEN OF ANY ACTOR. MAN, OH, MAN. YOU REALLY KNOCKED THE COVER OFF THE BALL ON THIS ONE. AND I WAS WATCHING THIS MOVIE AND I GO, BECAUSE I JUST KNOW YOU FROM, I DON'T KNOW, I HAVE SEEN YOU DO "JUNO." AND YOU JUST SEEM LIKE JUST A A NICE GUY. NOT IN THIS MOVIE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT WAS WILD, MAN! I WAS SHAKING WATCHING THIS, GOING, LIKE -- I WAS FRIGHTENED OF YOU. I'M A LITTLE SCARED NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
Jimmy: YEAH. I MEAN, YOU WERE JUST -- IT WAS JUST GREAT AND I'M WATCHING THE MOVIE AND I GO "PLEASE DON'T SCREW THIS UP", BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, A PERFECT PERFORMANCE. AND YOU DIDN'T SCREW IT UP. IT WAS REALLY GREAT, MAN, I GOT TO JUST COMMEND YOU ON THAT. IT WAS JUST INTENSE.
IT WAS SO GOOD ON THE PAGE, THAT WE REALLY FELT LIKE OUR JOB WAS NOT TO SCREW IT UP, YOU KNOW? BY WE, I MEAN MILES AND ME AND ALL THE REST OF THE ACTORS.
Jimmy: AND THE DIRECTOR IS THE WRITER AS WELL? NO?
YEAH, DAMIEN CHAZELLE, THE BOY WONDER.
Jimmy: HOW OLD IS HE?
HE'S A CHILD. HE'S 20. NOT 60.
Jimmy: HE'S NOT 60 AT ALL. MAN, HE DID A GREAT FILM. AND MILES TELLER, WE LOVE HIM AS WELL. HE WAS ON THE SHOW.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: AMAZING -- HE CAN ACTUALLY REALLY PLAY, TOO.
YEAH. YOU KNOW, NOT IN THAT UNIVERSE.
Jimmy: HE'S NOT QUESTLOVE. [ APPLAUSE ] QUEST, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN THAT MOVIE?
Questlove: ABOUT THREE TIMES. I MEAN, I WAS SCARED OF HIM ON "OZ", BUT NOTHING COMPARES TO --
Jimmy: "OZ" WAS GREAT TOO. BUT THIS WAS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, I'VE NEVER -- HAVE YOU EVER HAD A TEACHER LIKE THAT? HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN INTENSE TEACHER?
MAYBE A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH THAT CAME CLOSE, YOU KNOW? A LITTLE MORE APPROPRIATE THERE. WHAT I LOVE IS THAT MUSICIANS LOVE THE MOVIE, TOO. IF YOU'RE DOING A MUSIC MOVIE, AND MUSICIANS ARE DIGGING IT, THEN YOU KNOW YOU GOT IT RIGHT.
Jimmy: YOU DID IT RIGHT. AGAIN, I CAN'T SEE THIS GUY GETTING ANGRY AT ANYONE. COULD WE ZOOM IN? LOOK AT THIS GUY HERE? I MEAN, WHAT IS -- I MEAN, LEGALIZE IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS GUY?
