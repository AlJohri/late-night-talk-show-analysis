HERE YOU ARE. YOU'RE WATCHING "THE TONIGHT SHOW." YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU, GUYS. HERE'S WHO PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" JUST DID A A BIG PROFILE ON DONALD TRUMP, AND REVEALED THAT HE HAS LIFE-SIZED PORTRAITS OF RONALD REAGAN AND JOHN WAYNE AT HIS CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IF YOU DON'T SEE THEM RIGHT AWAY, IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND A 25-FOOT TALL PORTRAIT OF DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S RIGHT BEHIND -- IF YOU MOVE IT OUT OF THE WAY, YOU MAYBE CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF JOHN WAYNE. HOWDY. HOWDY, PILGRIM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HERE YOU GO AGAIN.
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER RECENTLY COMPARED HIMSELF TO THE JOCKEY WHO RIDES AMERICAN PHAROAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS IRONIC, BECAUSE IF HE GETS ELECTED, DONALD TRUMP WILL CHANGE THE TITLE OF PRESIDENT TO AMERICAN PHAROAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I WILL BUILD MY OWN PYRAMID. EVERYONE WILL LIVE IN PYRAMIDS." CNN IS REPORTING THAT MITT ROMNEY HAS GIVEN UP ON TRYING TO RECRUIT AN INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE TO RUN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. YEAH. YOU CAN TELL ROMNEY IS DEPRESSED, BECAUSE LAST NIGHT, HE DRANK AN ENTIRE BOTTLE OF GINGER ALE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE JUST WENT FOR IT. WENT FOR IT. THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME GOOD NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON. I READ THAT FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW, WASHINGTON D.C. WAS NAMED THE FITTEST CITY IN THE U.S. NAMELY BECAUSE MICHELE OBAMA GOES AROUND SLAPPING PIZZA OUT OF EVERYONE'S HANDS. HEY, IS THAT PIZZA? [ SLAPPING ] PIZZA? [ SLAPPING ] COME HERE. CAN I HAVE A BITE OF THAT PIZZA? [ SLAPPING ] [ LAUGHTER ] I'M THE FIRST LADY, YOU WANT ME TO SIGN THAT PIZZA? COME HERE. [ SLAPPING ] [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF PIZZA, I SAW THAT JOSH GROBAN RECENTLY POSTED A A PHOTO OF A PIZZA SOMEONE MADE THAT'S ACTUALLY A PORTRAIT OF HIM. THIS IS REAL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] PRETTY COOL. YOU KNOW, THAT CUSTOMER WAS LIKE, "HEY, I ORDERED HALF GROBAN, HALF BUBLE. WHAT'S GOING ON?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ SLAPPING ] GOT SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH PEOPLE?
Steve: WOW. SHE DOES NOT WANT PEOPLE EATING PIZZA.
Jimmy: I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS.
Steve: SHE SLAPPED THE PIZZA RIGHT OUT OF MY HAND.
Jimmy: WELL, YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT PIZZA. ONE? HOLD MY GLOVE, PLEASE. [ SLAPPING ] [ LAUGHTER ] HAND ME MY GLOVE BACK. [ SLAPPING ] [ LAUGHTER ] STILL THE SAME SOUND EFFECT. VERY INTERESTING. YEAH. ONE WAS MY HAND, THE OTHER WAS MY GLOVE.

CBS ANNOUNCED THAT SEASON 33 OF "SURVIVOR" WILL BE CALLED "SURVIVOR: MILLENNIALS VERSUS GEN-X." IT'LL START IN SEPTEMBER, AND END 20 MINUTES LATER WHEN BOTH TEAMS REALIZED THERE'S NO WI-FI. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "CAN WE GET A SIGNAL, MAN? JEFF, WHAT IS THIS?" THAT'S RIGHT. THE NEXT "SURVIVOR" WILL BE MILLENNIALS VERSUS GEN-X. THEY SAY THE WINNER WILL COME DOWN TO THOSE WHO CAN'T TO THOSE WHO CAN'T EVEN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I CAN'T EVEN. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN I HAVE A BITE OF THAT PIZZA? [ SLAPPING ] [ LAUGHTER ] HELLO, MRS. OBAMA. THIS IS COOL. I READ THAT LEONARDO DICAPRIO BOUGHT AN $18,000 CHANEL BAG FOR HIS MOM WHILE ATTENDING THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL. I WOULD BUY MY MOM A NICE BAG, TOO, BUT THEN SHE'D HAVE TO TRANSFER ALL OF HER KETCHUP PACKETS FROM HER PURSE. [ LAUGHTER ] "YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'LL NEED THEM, JIMMY." YEAH, I THINK I DO. I THINK I KNOW WHEN I'M GOING TO NEED THEM. "WANT AN OLD BREATH MINT WITH LINT ON IT?" NO, THANKS, MOM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. "I TOOK THE FIRST ONE OFF. THE SECOND ONE'S JUST AS FRESH. IT'S JUST LIKE A BRAND --" I DON'T NEED IT, MOM. I'M GOOD, THANKS.
Steve: HAVE SOME POP ROCKS.
Jimmy: SEE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS. THERE'S A NEW STUDY THAT FINDS THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED UNETHICAL AMNESIA, WHERE THEY CAN'T REMEMBER MISTAKES THEY MADE, BUT HAVE NO PROBLEM REMEMBERING OTHER PEOPLE'S MISTAKES. [ LAUGHTER ] OR AS MOST COUPLES PUT IT, "WELL THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED TO ME, BUT HE DOES IT ALL OF THE TIME." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S SOMETHING YOU DO. I REMEMBER. [ APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" JUST REPORTED THAT AMERICA HAS A SURPLUS OF CHEESE AND THAT EVERY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE TO EAT AN EXTRA THREE POUNDS OF CHEESE THIS YEAR TO GET RID OF IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO THE NEXT TIME THE PIZZA GUY JUDGES YOU FOR ORDERING EXTRA CHEESE, JUST SAY, "I'M DOING THIS FOR AMERICA." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ SLAPPING ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW!
