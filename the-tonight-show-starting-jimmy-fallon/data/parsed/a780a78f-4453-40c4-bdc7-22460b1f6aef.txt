AND I READ THAT HILLARY TOOK TIME OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO GET READY. WHILE DONALD TRUMP SPENT YESTERDAY STRETCHING OUT HIS THUMBS FOR ANOTHER 3:00 A.M. TWITTER MELTDOWN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] APPARENTLY, HILLARY SAYS SHE'S EXPECTING A PREPARED AND FOCUSED DONALD TRUMP TO SHOW UP TO SUNDAY'S DEBATE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TRUMP SAID, "WRONG." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DON'T SAY THAT. NOBODY SAYS --
Steve: WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, HILLARY CLINTON JUST DID AN INTERVIEW WITH "ELLE" MAGAZINE, AND SAID IN HIGH SCHOOL SHE RAN FOR CLASS PRESIDENT AND LOST. BUT IT GOT WEIRD WHEN SHE SHOWED UP AT HER HIGH SCHOOL EIGHT YEARS LATER AND RAN AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] COULDN'T STOP.
Steve: WOW. HAD TO DO IT. IN THE SAME INTERVIEW, HILLARY CLINTON TOLD A STORY ABOUT WHEN SHE WORE A FAKE PONY TAIL TO SCHOOL THAT GOT PULLED OFF IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

WELL THAT -- THE REASON I DID IT FOR TEN YEARS IS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO WIN FINALLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, NO. DID YOU HAVE FUN DOING IT?
OH, I LOVED IT. I MEAN, I'M FROM GULF BREEZE, FLORIDA, AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF THINGS TO DO IF YOU WANT TO SING AND DANCE AND YOU WANNA BE AN ENTERTAINER AND YOU WANNA BE AN ACTOR. YOU'VE GOT TO DO PAGEANTS, AND THAT WAS WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME.
Jimmy: WAS YOUR MOM INTO IT?
NO. NO. NOT AT ALL. MY DAD IS A PROFESSIONAL SURFER AND THIS IS LIKE MY MOTHER'S WORST NIGHTMARE THAT I DID ALL THIS STUFF, BUT I ROPED THEM AND I PULLED THEM ALONG BECAUSE I WAS LIKE, "I HAVE TO SING, I HAVE TO DANCE, I HAVE TO HAVE A A WAY TO DO THIS THING."
Jimmy: I HAVE TO GET OUT THERE, MOM! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? I HAVE TO!
YEAH.
Jimmy: I GOT TO BE A STAR!
I GOT TO BE A STAR! AND THEN I ROPED HER INTO MAKING ALL OF MY CLOTHES AND SHE DID MY HAIR AND WE CHOREOGRAPHED ALL MY ROUTINES TOGETHER.
Jimmy: WHAT ROUTINE WAS THAT ONE?
THIS WAS --
Jimmy: "CATS?" [ LAUGHTER ]
THE ONE THAT I CLEARLY DIDN'T WIN -- THAT'S WHY IT TOOK TEN YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I WAS LIKE, AH TEN YEARS?
Jimmy: DID YOU HAVE A GO TO TALENT THAT --
OH, YEAH. I WAS A SINGER. THAT'S WHAT I DID.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS THE SONG? DO YOU REMEMBER?
YEAH, OH, MY GOSH. WELL, THERE WERE A FEW. THERE WAS "IF I ONLY HAD A A BRAIN," WHICH IS ONE THAT I STARTED WITH.
Jimmy: REALLY?
I DRESSED AS A SCARECROW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I DID IT.
Jimmy: I LIKE THAT. THAT'S CUTE.
YEAH, A SONG FROM THE HEART, NOT THE BRAIN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN I HAD A "HIT ME WITH A HOT NOTE" BUT REALLY THE CULMINATION WAS "NEW YORK NEW YORK" THAT WAS MY BIG -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY BIG NUMBER.
Jimmy: THAT WAS YOUR THING.
THAT WAS MY BIG NUMBER BECAUSE I WOULD RELIGIOUSLY WATCH LIZA MINELLI SING THAT SONG OVER AND OVER AND OVER.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. SHE'S THE GREAT --
SHE'S GREAT.
Jimmy: AND CAN YOU GIVE US A A TASTE OF WHAT THAT WOULD BE LIKE?
I DON'T KNOW. SHOULD I? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHOULD I?
Jimmy: JUST GIVE US A TASTE.

Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. THAT WAS A KNOCK OUT. YOU WON, YOU WON, YOU WON, YOU WON.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU MADE IT -- YOU MADE IT HERE. YOU MADE IT EVERYWHERE. WOW, THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
OH, MY GOSH. I APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE FOR THAT.
Jimmy: WE LOVED THAT. ABIGAIL SPENCER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I NEVER SING. I NEVER SING ANYMORE.
Jimmy: THAT WAS AMAZING THAT YOU JUST COULD DO THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I MET LESLIE ODOM, JR. AT MY CARNEGIE MELLON AUDITION.
Jimmy: OH, HE'S THE BEST.
ISN'T HE THE GREATEST? HE'S ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS.
Jimmy: OH, NO, HE'S GREAT ON OUR SHOW. YEAH.
OH, MY GOSH. HE'S SO AMAZING.
Jimmy: HE CAME BACK AND SAT IN WITH THE ROOTS. HE HAS A NEW JAZZ ALBUM.
HE'S THE BEST. WE MET AT MY CARNEGIE MELLON AUDITION AND BECAME VERY GOOD FRIENDS EVER SINCE.
Jimmy: WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. DO YOU KNOW THIS? BOTH OF OUR TV DEBUTS WERE ON REGIS AND KATHY LEE.
YES, I HEARD ABOUT -- I WANT TO SEE THIS. HOW CAN I SEE THIS?
Jimmy: THERE'S A TAPE OF IT SOMEWHERE THAT EXISTS. I WENT WITH MY BUDDY BECAUSE I WAS A BIG FAN OF REGIS AND KATHY LEE. I HAD A CRUSH ON KATHY LEE GIFFORD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I LIKED HER. I LIKED THAT SHE COULD CLOSE ONE EYE. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY AND LIKE SHE COULD DO THE EYE. I CAN'T DO IT.
OH, 'CAUSE SHE HAS A LOT OF DEXTERITY IN HER EYES. YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, SHE CAN DO THAT. IT'S THE BEST.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I HAD EVERYTHING. I HAD THE CALENDARS. THE REGIS AND KATHY LEE -- YEAH, I WAS A BIG FAN.
OH, MY GOSH. I LOVE THIS.
Jimmy: SO I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, I THINK, OR COLLEGE AT THE TIME AND I WENT WITH MY BUDDY, GOT TICKETS, WE WENT, WE WERE SO EXCITED. AND YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THAT CONTEST WHERE IT'S LIKE, WHO WAS THE STAR OF "TOP GUN?" YOU KNOW? THEN I GO, UH --
WITH THE WHEEL WHEN THEY LIKE --
Jimmy: YEAH. THEN THEY GO, TOM CRUISE. AND THEY GO, ALL RIGHT, PICK A A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 TO 200, AND SOMEONE IN THE CROWD WINS IT. I SAID TO MY BUDDY, "NO MATTER WHAT NUMBER THEY YELL, STAND UP LIKE WE WON." YEAH.
THAT'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: 'CAUSE IT'S LIVE.
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED THAT. LIKE, HOW WOULD THEY KNOW?
Jimmy: LIVE TV. THEY'RE LIKE, 31. WE HAD THE WORST SEATS AND WE WE'RE LIKE, OH MY GOSH, WE WON! THE CAMERA CAME ON, I'M LIKE, HI, MOM. YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ]
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, IT WAS A A BIG DEAL.
THAT WAS AMAZING.
Jimmy: NOW WHAT WAS YOUR STORY?
WELL, WHEN I MET LESLIE ODOM JR., I WAS IN NEW YORK AUDITIONING FOR ALL OF THE THEATER SCHOOLS, I WAS GOING TO DO MUSICAL THEATER. AND MY FATHER WAS KATHY LEE'S FIRST LOVE. SO WHEN SHE WAS 15 -- CONTROVERSIAL, OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SCANDAL.
SCANDAL. THE SURFER AND THE JUNIOR MISS. BECAUSE SHE WAS JUNIOR MISS AND MY DAD WAS PROFESSIONAL SURFER, SO OF COURSE THEY SHOULD MEET. BUT MY DAD KEPT IN TOUCH WITH HER OVER THE YEARS, AND MY MOM KNEW ABOUT IT. SO MY MOM AND I -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I GET IT.
YOU GOT IT. AND MY MOM AND I WERE COMING TO NEW YORK TO DO ALL OF THESE AUDITIONS, AND JUST AS LIKE A A FUN -- I HAD NEVER BEEN TO NEW YORK BEFORE. AGAIN, LITTLE MISS GULF BREEZE. LIKE, SMALL TOWN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. AND YEAH, REMEMBER HER?
Jimmy: FLUFFY DRESS.
THERE SHE IS. NOTHING CHANGED. AND SO SHE GOT A TICKET TO THE SHOW. HE REACHED OUT TO HER AND SAID, "MY DAUGHTER AND MY WIFE ARE COMING, COULD THEY COME SIT IN THE AUDIENCE?" SO WE WERE JUST LIKE, "OH MY GOSH, A FUN TOURIST THING TO DO. THIS WILL BE GREAT." AND THEN FIVE MINUTES INTO THE SHOW, WHEN THEY STARTED, ALL OF A SUDDEN, KATHY LEE GOES, "WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY." AND I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE FAMOUS. I'M LIKE, "DAVID LETTERMAN'S IN THE AUDIENCE," LIKE, JUST LOOK BECAUSE SHE HAD ALL THESE FAMOUS FRIENDS.
Jimmy: DAVID LETTERMAN WOULD BE SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE, YEAH.
THAT WAS WHAT I THOUGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS LIKE, "MAYBE THEY DO THAT." LIKE, MAYBE THEY'LL HELP EACH OTHER OUT.
Jimmy: HE MIGHT HAVE. I HAVE NO IDEA.
THEY HIGH FIVE EACH OTHER BEFORE THEIR TALK SHOWS.
Jimmy: IT'S VERY POSSIBLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
LITTLE MISS GULF BREEZE.
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW.
SO THEN, SHE GOES, "EVERYONE, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET ABIGAIL SPENCER," AND I WAS -- I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?" AND THEN ONE OF THESE GIANT CAMERAS, LIKE, EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, CAME FORWARD RIGHT INTO MY FACE, AND SHE GOES, "ABIGAIL, TELL EVERYONE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN NEW YORK." AND I WENT, "I'M A SINGER AND AN ACTRESS AND A DANCER AND I'M HERE AUDITIONING FOR COLLEGES AND I'M GOING TO BE A A DIRECTOR." LITERALLY, I JUST, LIKE, WENT FOR IT. I DID IT.
Jimmy: NO WAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, YEAH. ALL IN. 17 YEARS OLD. SUPER GREEN. NO FEAR.
Jimmy: WOW.
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT THE CASTING DIRECTOR OF "ALL MY CHILDREN" WAS WATCHING THE LIVE FEED AND KATHY LEE'S ASSISTANT CALLED THE CASTING DIRECTOR AND SAID, "HEY, WE'RE CHATTING WITH THIS GIRL IN THE AUDIENCE THAT KATHY KNOWS AND SHE WANTS TO BE AN ACTRESS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET HER?" AND OF COURSE LIKE, USUALLY PEOPLE, LIKE, CLICK, BUT NO, JUDY WAS LIKE, "OH MY GOSH, I'M WATCHING THE LIVE FEED, I'D LOVE TO MEET HER." SO THE NEXT DAY, I HAD A A GENERAL MEETING WITH THE CASTING DIRECTOR OF "ALL MY CHILDREN" AND I WILL NEVER FORGET IT. I HAD THIS EMERALD GREEN 70s COAT AND MY BERET AND I WAS LIKE SASHAY, "I LOVE NEW YORK!' YOU KNOW, LIKE, "LOVE IS ALL AROUND US," JUST LIKE MARY TYLER MOORE-ING MY WAY DOWN TO --
Jimmy: MARY TYLER MORE, YEAH. ♪ YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL ♪ [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
AND I HAD THE MEETING, AND LITERALLY, I GUESS, FOUR MONTHS LATER, I HAD BEEN CAST ON THE SHOW.
