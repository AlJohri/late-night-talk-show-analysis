[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE JUST RELEASED A NEW MEMOIR CALLED "NOT DEAD YET" AND HE ALSO HAS A COLLECTION OF HIS SINGLES RIGHT HERE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME PHIL COLLINS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, WELCOME! WELCOME TO THE SHOW! STANDING OVATION. WE LOVE YOU, PHIL COLLINS. WELCOME BACK AND WELCOME TO OUR SHOW. WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
NICE TO BE HERE. I'VE WANTED TO BE HERE FOR A A LONG TIME, AND I, MAY I CONGRATULATE YOU ON ALL YOU'VE ACHIEVED, JIMMY, JUST IN CASE YOU THROW ME OFF BEFORE THE END, YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT. CAN I, I JUST SAY, WE DIDN'T, WE WERE SO EXCITED THAT HAD YOU'RE COMING ON BECAUSE WE THOUGHT YOU RETIRED.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND I THINK YOU DID, ACTUALLY.
WELL, I DID. I CHANGED MY MIND, THOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I LOVE THE TITLE, "NOT DEAD YET." I THINK THAT ABSOLUTELY SUMS UP YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE VERY, VERY, LIKE, ALMOST LIKE A -- YOU'RE VERY DARK. [ LAUGHTER ] IN A GOOD WAY.
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I MEAN -- THE TROUBLE IS, OF COURSE, WHEN YOU'RE TRANSLATING A TITLE INTO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, I MEAN, THE BOOK'S GONE TO GERMAN, ITALIAN, SPANISH, POLISH, CZECH -- YOU KNOW, THE JOKE MIGHT WEAR A LITTLE THIN ON SOME OF THOSE TRANSLATIONS.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T QUITE WORK. THEY GO --
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NOT BE DEAD YET," YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: "HOW CAN YOU NOT BE DEAD YET? WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I -- YOU KNOW, AS I SAID, I'M A FAN. I DOWNLOADED YOUR -- ALL YOUR STUFF. I HAVE IT ON iTUNES BUT I WAS ALSO STREAMING IT ON SPOTIFY OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE, YOU CAN STREAM ALL YOUR SONGS. I WAS LISTENING TO IT THE OTHER DAYS, AND I SAW THAT YOU REDID THE ALBUM COVER.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I THINK THIS WAS A A GREAT IDEA. I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE'S DONE THIS, BUT YOU DID IT.
NO. WELL, I DID IT. I WANTED TO BRING SOMETHING NEW, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THE RECORD COMPANY CAME AND SAID, "YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO REISSUE THE ALBUMS," AND I SAID, "HMM, MARKETING, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE IF I WANT TO REPACKAGE, BUT UNLESS I CAN BRING SOMETHING NEW TO IT." SO WE ADDED A SECOND CD TO EVERY CD OF LIVE MATERIAL, BUT I SAID I'D LIKE TO RETAKE THE COVERS AND THEY SAID, "OHH, NO NO. SEE, THAT WILL CONFUSE PEOPLE." AND I SAID -- WELL, YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: JUST DO IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT, I GO, "HEY, THAT -- DOES THE COVER LOOK DIFFERENT?" BUT THIS IS REAL.
I ACTUALLY PREFER THE NEW ONES, SEE?
Jimmy: YEAH, ME TOO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S TOO MUCH OF A BABY FACE HERE. OF COURSE, THIS ONE --
THIS WAS A HARD ONE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NO NEED TO LAUGH. NO NEED TO LAUGH.
Jimmy: BECAUSE YOU HAD THIS PIG CURL GOING THERE AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS TOUGH ON THIS ONE.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO MENTION THAT.
Jimmy: SORRY. I DIDN'T -- [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YEAH --
IT'S THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, ISN'T IT? YEAH, THAT WAS KIND OF THE DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE IT WAS FULL. SOME OF THE OTHER ONES WERE CROPPED.
Jimmy: I JUST LOVE THAT YOU HAVE THE -- I DON'T KNOW, JUST --
IT'S NOT SOMETHING ROCK STARS, POP STARS, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT, DO.
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO BE, LIKE, "YEAH, I DON'T CARE." ♪ I DON'T CARE ANYMORE ♪ ♪♪ DO YOU EVER HEAR THAT? GOSH, THAT WAS OFF KEY. AND LET'S --
NO, NO.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
IF I CAN'T MAKE IT ONE NIGHT, I KNOW WHERE TO COME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- FIRST OF ALL, "IN THE AIR TONIGHT" IS -- I WENT THROUGH ONLY A HANDFUL OF YOUR HITS AND YOU'RE JUST AMAZING. YOU HAVE THIS NEW BOX SET, "THE SINGLES," WHICH IS ALSO ON VINYL, WHICH I LOVE THAT YOU'RE DOING ON VINYL.
THESE ARE ALL THE SINGLES.
Jimmy: "IN THE AIR TONIGHT" IS THE ONE -- I MEAN, IT STICKS IN MY HEAD BECAUSE THAT'S THE --
THAT'S GOT A LIFE OF ITS OWN. I MEAN, THAT, THAT WILL OUTLIVE ME. THAT SONG.
Jimmy: NO. WELL, THAT COULD BE THE SEQUEL TO, THAT COULD BE YOUR NEXT AUTOBIOGRAPHY, "THIS BOOK WILL OUTLIVE ME." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU, IS THIS TRUE THAT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED? THIS IS WHAT I HEARD. YOU WERE ON -- YOU WERE OUTSIDE AT NIGHT, AND THERE'S A GUY -- YOU SAW SOMEBODY -- SAW SOMEONE DROWNING. AND HE DIDN'T -- YES -- AND HE LET HIM DROWN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE LET HIM DROWN, AND YOU WATCHED A MAN BASICALLY MURDER SOMEBODY. AND THEN SO INSTEAD OF CALLING THE AUTHORITIES, YOU INVITED THE MAN -- STRANGER TO YOUR CONCERT? AND THEN --
SHONE A LIGHT ON HIM.
Jimmy: YES! YOU SHONE A LIGHT ON HIM AND YOU SANG "IN THE AIR TONIGHT," AND YOU GO, "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID, BUDDY." OH, MY GOSH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
OKAY.
Jimmy: THAT IS THE BEST STORY I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.
I KNOW. UNFORTUNATELY, NONE OF IT'S TRUE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT?!?
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST PISSED OFF, YOU KNOW? I WAS ANGRY.
Jimmy: AT WHAT?
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU GO THROUGH A DIVORCE, AND YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE, "PLEASE, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU. DON'T HANG UP, DON'T HANG --" AND THEN IT'S LIKE, "WELL, -- YOU."
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN OF COURSE THAT'S WHEN A SONG LIKE "IN THE AIR TONIGHT" COMES OUT. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF ANGER IN THERE.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHEN THAT DRUM SOLO COMES IN, WHERE IT GOES -- [ IMITATING DRUMS ]
BY THE TIME THE END OF THE PROGRAM COMES, YOU'LL BE GOOD AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S NOT ME I'M WORRIED ABOUT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. HE REALLY HAS BEEN STRESSING ABOUT THIS FOR, LIKE, MONTHS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU DOING IT, I KNOW YOU'RE GOING ON TOUR RIGHT NOW.
WELL, I'M DOING SOME SHOWS, YES.
Jimmy: LONDON, PARIS, GERMANY. ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING IN THE STATES?
WELL, I'M JUST TAKING BABY STEPS. YOU KNOW, MY SON -- I MEAN, I'VE GOT THREE SONS, YOU KNOW. 11-YEAR-OLD PLAYS SOCCER. HE'S A WHIZ, CAPTAIN OF HIS TEAM. MY OLDEST SON, SIMON, IS 40 AND HE'S CHANNELING HIS OWN PATH. AND NICHOLAS IS GOING TO BE 16 BY THE TIME I DO THE SHOWS, BUT HE'S ALREADY PLAYED THE U.S. OPEN, AND ALREADY PLAYED SOME SHOWS THIS YEAR, BUT HE'S FANTASTIC. SO HE'S GOING TO BE MY DRUMMER, YEAH.
Jimmy: WHEN YOU GO ON TOUR.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HERE'S A PICTURE OF HIM PRACTICING WITH YOU. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] THERE HE IS. THAT'S A PRETTY COOL MOMENT.
YEAH, THAT WAS TAKEN LAST WEEK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S BENJAMIN BUTTONS. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S UNBELIEVABLE. HE'S A MAGICAL CHILD. SO, YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE US A A TASTE OF IT TONIGHT. CONGRATS ON THE MEMOIR. CONGRATS ON THE BOX SET.
