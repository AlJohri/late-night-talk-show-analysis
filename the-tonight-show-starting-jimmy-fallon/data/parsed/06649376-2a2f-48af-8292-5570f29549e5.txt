FIRST, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. DONALD TRUMP KICKED OFF HIS BIG THANK YOU TOUR LAST NIGHT IN OHIO. AND I SAW THAT HIS SPEECH WAS ON AT THE SAME TIME AS THE "CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS SPECIAL." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S NICE BECAUSE WHILE KIDS ARE WATCHING "CHARLIE BROWN" CHRISTMAS, THEIR PARENTS GOT TO WATCH THE GREAT PUMPKIN. AND YOU KNOW -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ AS PEANUTS ADULT ] WAH, WAH, WAH, WAH, WAH, WAH, WAH. [ LAUGHTER ] "WAH, WAH, WAH, WALL. WALL, WALL, WALL, WALL. [ LAUGHTER ] WALL, WALL, WALL. MEXICANS PAY FOR IT." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S VERY INTERESTING. AND WHILE KICKING OFF HIS THANK YOU TOUR, TRUMP SAID, "WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME FOCUSING ON WHAT DIVIDES US, AND WE NEED TO EMBRACE WHAT UNITES US." THEN HE WENT BACK TO VISITING ONLY THE STATES THAT VOTED FOR HIM. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT AFTER THAT -- DURING HIS SPEECH, TRUMP JOKED THAT CARS USED TO BE MADE IN MICHIGAN AND YOU COULDN'T DRINK THE WATER IN MEXICO, BUT NOW CARS ARE MADE IN MEXICO AND YOU CAN'T DRINK THE WATER IN MICHIGAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN HE SAID, "AND WHY IS IT THAT WE DRIVE IN THE PARKWAY BUT PARK IN THE DRIVEWAY? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?" [ LAUGHTER ] "WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT THAN MEN. WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON?" [ LAUGHTER ] I NOTICED THAT AT THE END OF HIS BIG RALLY LAST NIGHT, TRUMP PLAYED THE SONG, "YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT." [ LAUGHTER ] OR AS IT'S NOW KNOWN, THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. "I'M OUTIE 5000."
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF CHRISTMAS, A WOMAN IN NORTH CAROLINA OPENED WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT, BUT WAS SURPRISED TO FIND FOUR POUNDS OF MARIJUANA THAT WAS ACCIDENTALLY SENT TO HER HOUSE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHILE SOMEWHERE, SNOOP DOGG SENT THE DAY TRYING TO SMOKE A A FRUITCAKE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TRYING TO SMOKE A FRUITCAKE. SNOOP DOGG IS TRYING TO SMOKE A A FRUITCAKE.

Jimmy: I APPRECIATE YOU DOING THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE LOVE EVERY TIME YOU COME ON THE SHOW. YOU ALWAYS KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU'RE AMAZING BUT I GOT TO SEE "LA LA LAND," I GOT -- I WENT TO A SCREENING. MAN, OH MAN, YOU'RE FANTASTIC --
OH, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND THAT MOVIE IS MAGICAL.
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL? DAMIEN CHAZELLE WHO'S LIKE 12 --
Jimmy: YEAH. WHO IS THIS DUDE?
LIKE HE'S A YOUNG WRITER/DIRECTOR. HE'S LIKE 31 AND HE'S ALREADY DONE "WHIPLASH" AND "LA LA LAND."
Jimmy: IS HE SUPER INTO JAZZ?
HE'S REALLY INTO MUSIC, REALLY INTO JAZZ. AND REALLY INTO GREAT FILM MAKING. HE'S JUST --
Jimmy: HE HIT A HOMERUN --
HE'S AN AMAZING TALENT AND I WAS JUST HAPPY TO BE A PART OF THIS.
Jimmy: BUT YOU HAD TO GO -- DO YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY GUITAR?
NO, I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY GUITAR AND I STILL DON'T REALLY BUT I KNEW ENOUGH TO, LIKE, BE ABLE TO FINGER THE CHORDS AND LOOK, YOU KNOW, PASSABLE.
Jimmy: AND, HAVE YOU BEEN IN OTHER MOVIES?
I WAS IN "SOUL MAN," BUT I DIDN'T SPEAK IN THAT. THAT WAS A MOVIE WITH BERNIE MAC AND SAM JACKSON --
Jimmy: OF COURSE, I LOVE -- YEAH.
YEARS AGO. AND I DIDN'T SPEAK IN THAT MOVIE SO THIS IS MY FIRST REAL SPEAKING ROLE.
Jimmy: OH MY GOD. I MEAN, TALK ABOUT A GREAT MOVIE TO BE IN.
I MEAN, I'M, LIKE, HUMBLED, THAT RYAN GOSLING, EMMA STONE, AND THEN DIRECTED BY DAMIAN IS PRETTY GOOD COMPANY.
Jimmy: EVERYBODY KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK IN THIS MOVIE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT THEY CAN PLAY, RYAN GOSLING IS MUSICALLY TALENTED.
RYAN REALLY KIND OF PISSED ME OFF BECAUSE HE LEARNED HOW TO PLAY PIANO SO BEAUTIFULLY AND I'M LIKE, I'VE BEEN PLAYING SINCE I WAS FOUR, MAN. IT'S NOT FAIR. HE LIKE REALLY LEARNED HOW TO PLAY AND REALLY DID A GREAT JOB AND HE HAD TO PLAY LIKE A A REALLY ACCOMPLISHED JAZZ PIANIST. AND HE DID A MAGNIFICENT JOB, AND EMMA IS AMAZING IN IT. IT'S JUST REALLY, I'M JUST LUCKY TO BE IN SUCH GOOD COMPANY.
Jimmy: NO, YOU DID IT AND YOU NAILED IT AND IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST BEAUTIFULLY DONE. I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL ANYTHING FOR ANYONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE MOVIE'S ABOUT. BUT JUST GO SEE IT, BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE --
IT'S ABOUT LOVE AND ABOUT PURSUING YOUR DREAMS AND SOMETIMES THOSE TWO THINGS DON'T WORK TOGETHER. THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S ABOUT AND IT'S KIND OF A LOVE LETTER TO LOS ANGELES AS WELL. BUT IT'S ABOUT DREAMERS, AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO FALL IN LOVE AND ALSO WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING OF THEIR CAREER AS AN ARTIST.
Jimmy: I WANNA SHOW A CLIP. HERE'S JOHN LEGEND AND RYAN GOSLING IN "LA LA LAND." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
YOU SAY YOU WANNA SAVE JAZZ? HOW YOU GOING TO SAVE JAZZ IF NO ONE'S LISTENING? JAZZ IS DYING BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU. YOU'RE PLAYING TO 90-YEAR-OLDS AT THE LIGHTHOUSE. WHERE ARE THE KIDS? WHERE ARE THE YOUNG PEOPLE? YOU'RE SO OBSESSED WITH KENNY CLARKE AND THELONIOUS MONK. THESE GUYS WERE REVOLUTIONARIES. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE A A REVOLUTIONARY IF YOU'RE SUCH A TRADITIONALIST? YOU'RE HOLDING ON TO THE PAST, BUT JAZZ IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. [ APPLAUSE ]
