"NO, IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE, EVERYTHING'S GOOD." THIS IS COOL. OVER 4,000 SERVICE MEMBERS COME TO NEW YORK CITY DURING FLEET WEEK. YEAH, SO IF YOU SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAPPY TO BE OFF A GIANT SHIP, THEY'RE EITHER SAILORS OR THEY JUST GOT OFF A CARNIVAL CRUISE. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, 'CAUSE -- [ APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, A LOT OF YOU SAILORS ARE EXCITED TO COME ASHORE, LEAVING BEHIND YOUR TINY BUNKS ON THE SHIP. THEN YOU SEE WHAT A NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT LOOKS LIKE AND GO, "BACK TO THE SHIP! LET'S GO! [ LAUGHTER ] $3,000 FOR THAT?" [ APPLAUSE ] ONE OF THE EVENTS FOR FLEET WEEK IS THE "PARADE OF SHIPS" ALONG THE HUDSON RIVER. THAT'S ONE MORE REASON WE LOVE YOU GUYS, YOU FIND A WAY TO HAVE A PARADE IN NEW YORK CITY THAT DOESN'T SCREW UP TRAFFIC. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. AS A NEW YORKER, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HERE'S A LITTLE INTERNATIONAL NEWS. NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN IS APPARENTLY PLANNING A A REALITY SHOW TO FIND A A HUSBAND FOR HIS UNMARRIED SISTER.

I'M DEFENDING. I AM -- THIS IS WHAT I'M MADE FOR." THEN I WAS, LIKE, 15 AT THE DINNER TABLE, AND I WAS SAYING THAT SAME SPEECH. "I CAN'T WAIT TO JOIN THE MILITARY." MY FATHER GOES, "YOU'RE NOT JOINING THE MILITARY." I GO, "WHY NOT?" HE GOES, "'CAUSE YOU'RE A A PUSSY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

I STUDY WITH THEM FOR HOURS, AND THEN THEY GO TO SLEEP, AND THEN I CALL A LADY UP. I WAS LIKE, "WE GOT TO GO OVER THIS, MAN. THIS IS INSANE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, I'M SO TIRED. I KNOW IT SOUNDS BAD, BUT I TOLD THE KIDS THEY GOT TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. I CAN'T HANDLE IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
