I GUESS WE'LL JUST AGREE TO DISAGREE.
Jimmy: IT'S MOST LIKELY YOU.
WE NOW HAVE BLUE ON THE FACE, WHICH I LIKE.
Jimmy: I'M LIKE A LITTLE KID WITH FINGER PAINTS.
IT'S STARTING TO MOVE. I LIKE IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LIKE MY LITTLE KIDS WITH FINGER PAINT. "LOOK WHAT I MADE, DADDY." I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SHOW, "GREAT NEWS." WE TALKED ABOUT THIS WHEN WE SAW EACH OTHER. THIS IS PRODUCED BY THE COMEDY GENIUS MINDS OF MY PAL TINA FEY --
YES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AND ROBERT CARLOCK WHO DID -- WHO BROUGHT YOU "30 ROCK."
YES.
Jimmy: CONGRATS ON THIS. WHAT IS "GREAT NEWS?" WHAT IS IT ABOUT?
OKAY, SO "GREAT NEWS" IS ABOUT A VERY SWEET GIRL NAMED KATIE WHO WANTS TO HAVE A JOB AS A SERIOUS SEGMENT PRODUCER ON A NEWS SHOW. AND HER MOTHER DECIDES TO GET A A SENIOR INTERNSHIP ON THE SHOW. AND I PLAY, ALONG WITH JOHN MICHAEL HIGGINS, WE ARE THE CO-ANCHORS OF THIS -- OF THIS NEWS SHOW.

Jimmy: IN THE NEW COMEDY "GREAT NEWS."
"GREAT NEWS!" WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO!
Jimmy: TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH JOURNALISM TODAY. IT'S MORE ABOUT THE PERSONALITY SAYING THE NEWS THAN THE NEWS ITSELF. A REAL NEWSMAN HAS NO PERSONALITY. WALTER CRONKITE SAID ONE THING AT THE END OF HIS SHOW, "AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS." NOT "I FEEL MEH TODAY," OR "I LIKE BREAKFAST FOR DINNER." I FOR ONE WILL NOT BE BETRAYING THE NEWS. I'M NOT A BENEDICT ARNOLD LIKE YOU.
BENEDICT ARNOLD WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO WASN'T A TRAITOR.
CHUCK DOES HAVE A POINT. EXCEPT IN THE DIGITAL ERA WELL-REASONED OPINIONS ARE MORE VALUABLE THAN THE ARCHAIC MODEL OF SO-CALLED OBJECTIVE JOURNALISM. ALSO, WHAT'S A WALTER CONKRITE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT IS A A WALTER CONKRITE? NICOLE RICHIE! "GREAT NEWS" PREMIERES TUESDAY APRIL 25th AT 9:00 P.M. ON NBC. THEY LOVE IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A A PERFORMANCE FROM FLO RIDA AND 99 PERCENT. WOO! STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
