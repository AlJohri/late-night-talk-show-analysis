Jimmy: OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT RIGHT THERE. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. OH, MY GOD. OH, MAKES ME FEEL SO GOOD. HOT CROWD TONIGHT. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." YOU'RE HERE. THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. THIS IS THE SHOW. THIS IS IT. THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. [ CHEERS ] I CAN TELL YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD. WE'RE ALL IN A GOOD MOOD HERE TONIGHT. THE ROCKEFELLER CHRISTMAS TREE JUST ARRIVED TODAY HERE IN NEW YORK. [ CHEERS ] RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS. THAT'S RIGHT. PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE BUILDING ARE ALREADY STARTING TO SAY THE TRADITIONAL HOLIDAY GREETING, MOVE! [ LAUGHTER ] WE ALL HATE THAT TREE SECRETLY.
Steve: OH YEAH. YES WE DO.
Jimmy: LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS, HERE. DID YOU SEE THIS? IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, BEN CARSON SAID THAT HE BELIEVES THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE USED TO STORE GRAIN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] KIND OF A CRAZY THING TO SAY. BUT IT DOES EXPLAIN WHY CARSON'S POLL NUMBERS ARE ABOUT TO GO FROM HERE TO HERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HIYO! HIYO! ♪ WALK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN ♪
Jimmy: THANKS, QUEST. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CARSON'S ACTUALLY IN A BIT OF TROUBLE RIGHT NOW. BEN CARSON. TODAY HE ADMITTED THAT HE LIED ABOUT A PARTNER'S MEMOIR WHERE HE SAID HE WAS ADMITTED TO WEST POINT ON A FULL SCHOLARSHIP. YEAH, WASN'T TRUE, YEAH. PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "ARE YOU LYING ABOUT ANY OTHER PARTS OF YOUR LIFE?" AND CARSON WAS LIKE, "THERE MIGHT BE A COUPLE OF OTHER FIBS LURKING ABOUT. I MEAN I'M NOT -- [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, NO. I'M NOT A CHIMNEY SWEEP." A NEW REPORT FROM CNN SUGGESTS THAT BEN CARSON MADE UP THE STORIES OF HIS VIOLENT TEMPER FROM HIS YOUTH, INCLUDING ONE WHERE HE SAID HE ALMOST STABBED A KID. THIS IS HOW WEIRD THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] A CANDIDATE IS NOW IN TROUBLE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T STAB SOMEONE AS A KID. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW WEIRD THAT IS? WHAT IS GOING ON? THE TROUBLE.
Steve: WHAT?!
Jimmy: BEN CARSON IS CLAIMING THAT HE WAS VIOLENT WHEN HE WAS A KID, BUT NO ONE CAN ACTUALLY DIG UP ANY DETAILS TO PROVE IT. SO CNN FINALLY CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT YESTERDAY, AND CHECK OUT WHAT CARSON SAID.
WERE THOSE CLASSMATES? WERE THEY FRIENDS? WERE THEY NEIGHBORS? HOW DO YOU CHARACTERIZE, BECAUSE OUR INVESTIGATION COULD NOT FIND THESE PEOPLE.
WELL, WHY WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO FIND THEM? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THEM, UNLESS I TELL YOU WHO THEY ARE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: UNLESS I TELL YOU WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHERE WOULD YOU LOOK? WHERE WOULD YOU KNOW WHERE TO START LOOKING? EVEN ROBERT DURST WAS LIKE, HE KILLED THEM ALL, OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, BEN CARSON'S CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED A 60-SECOND AD THAT FEATURES A RAP ABOUT BEN CARSON AIMED AT YOUNG BLACK VOTERS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, IT WILL DO GREAT WITH YOUNG WHITE VOTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, THEY'RE GONNA LAUNCH A 60 SECOND AD THAT FEATURES A RAP ABOUT BEN CARSON. SOME OF THE AUDIO WAS ALREADY LEAKED ONLINE. THIS IS REAL. ♪♪ ♪ BEN CARSON 2016 DOPE SUPPORT BEN CARSON ♪ ♪ FOR OUR NEXT PRESIDENT IT'D BE AWESOME ♪ [ LAUGHTER ]

Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT IS -- CARSON IS AWESOME! DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY SPENT A A LOT OF TIME ON THAT.

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WELL, MAYBE IT IS HIS FALLING POLL NUMBERS, BUT DONALD TRUMP IS ACTUALLY STARTING TO RUN SOME RADIO ADS WHERE HE ACCUSES POLITICIANS OF BEING ALL TALK AND NO ACTION. WHICH IS IRONIC BECAUSE RADIO ADS ARE LITERALLY ALL TALK AND NO ACTION. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT RADIO IS. BUT IN THE SAME AD -- A WEIRD THING TO SAY ON THE RADIO. TRUMP DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS SOMEONE WHO, QUOTE, "LEARNED THE VALUES OF HARD WORK AT AND EARLY AGE." THAT'S RIGHT, DONALD TRUMP COULDN'T HAVE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT HARD WORK, DETERMINATION AND THIS.
MY FATHER GAVE ME A SMALL LOAN OF A MILLION DOLLARS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SMALL LOAN. NOTHING. BASICALLY NOTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] A MILLION DOLLARS. BIG DEAL. YOU CAN KEEP IT, SON. JUST TAKE THE MILLION DOLLARS. GO GET YOURSELF SOMETHING TO EAT.
Steve: GET A SOFT DRINK.
Jimmy: GO GET YOURSELF A A SOFT DRINK OR SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ] GO BUY A CHAIN OF STORES OR SOMETHING. JUST A SMALL LOAN.
Jimmy: I SAW THAT JEB BUSH ACTUALLY RESPONDED TO AN E-MAIL FROM A COLLEGE STUDENT AT U.T. AUSTIN. AND WHEN THE STUDENT ASKED IF IT WAS REALLY JEB, HE WROTE BACK, "SADLY, IT IS ME." [ LAUGHTER ] ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I THINK JEB FINALLY FOUND A CAMPAIGN SLOGAN THAT WORKS. "JEB BUSH, SADLY IT IS ME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S NOT GOING WELL. IT JUST -- THIS ISN'T GOOD. EARLIER THIS WEEK THE NATIONAL DEBT GREW BY NEARLY $340 BILLION, WHICH IS THE BIGGEST SURGE IN A SINGLE DAY FOR THE U.S. TREASURY. APPARENTLY OBAMA WAS STILL SIGNED INTO AMAZON WHEN HE LET BIDEN PLAY WITH HIS iPAD AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU CAN'T DO THAT. GET THIS GUYS, A COMPANY JUST CAME OUT WITH A WAFFLE MAKER THAT MAKES WAFFLES WITH THE "STAR WARS" DEATH STAR ON THEM. YEAH. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO LEAVE YOUR WAFFLES ON THERE TOO LONG OR IT WILL COME OUT ON THE DARK SIDE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S FOR THE KIDS.
Steve: FOR THE KIDS.
Jimmy: YOU GOTTA YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE FOR THE KIDS.
Steve: SHARE IT WITH YOUR MOM. TALK ABOUT PORKINS.
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, THIS IS CRAZY. DID YOU SEE THE VIDEO OF THIS GUY? A MAN IN IOWA WAS DRUNK DRIVING THIS WEEK WHEN POLICE TRIED TO GIVE HIM A BREATHALYZER TEST. AND HE USED AN INTERESTING TRICK TO TRY TO AVOID GETTING CAUGHT. CHECK THIS OUT.
39-YEAR-OLD ROSS McDONALD WAS GOING THE WRONG WAY DOWN A A STREET, SO POLICE PULLED HIM OVER. McDONALD SHOWED SIGNS OF BEING DRUNK, SO THEY GAVE HIM A A BREATHALYZER TEST. AND THAT'S WHEN McDONALD TRIED TO EAT TOILET PAPER TO TRY TO INTERFERE WITH THE BREATHALYZER. IT DIDN'T WORK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M PRETTY SURE IF YOU SEE A GUY EATING TOILET PAPER, YOU DON'T NEED A TEST TO KNOW HE'S DRUNK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT TIME HE NEEDS TO USE BOUNTY, THE QUICKER SOBER UPPER. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪

I KNOW IT IS THE MOST TALKED ABOUT THING NO MATTER WHAT IT IS. IT'S BIGGER THAN BROADWAY AND EVERYTHING. BUT IT'S THE MOST TALKED ABOUT EVENT. EVERYONE WANTS TICKETS TO GO SEE THIS. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE IDEA TO DO A MUSICAL ABOUT HAMILTON?
I WAS ON VACATION WITH MY THEN GIRLFRIEND, NOW WIFE. I WAS -- I JUST PICKED UP A A BOOK AT RANDOM AT BORDERS BACK WHEN BOOK STORES STILL EXISTED.
Jimmy: YES, I LOVE BORDERS!
AND I GRABBED THE HAMILTON BIOGRAPHY. AND I THOUGHT, WELL ALL I KNEW ABOUT HIM IS WHAT YOU YOU LEARN IN HISTORY CLASS, WHICH IS THAT HE DIES IN A DUEL. SO I WAS LIKE, IT WILL HAVE A A GOOD ENDING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SPOILER ALERT. YEAH, EXACTLY.
SO, I PICKED THAT UP AND I GRABBED IT. AND AS I STARTED READING IT, I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS AN IMMIGRANT. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE WROTE HIS WAY OUT OF THE CARIBBEAN. HE HAD THIS AMAZING, TRAUMATIC EARLY LIFE AND I JUST THOUGHT, THIS IS -- WHEN HE WROTE A POEM THAT LITERALLY GOT HIM OUT OF HIS CIRCUMSTANCES, I THOUGHT, "THIS IS THE MOST HIP-HOP GUY I EVER HEARD."
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I WENT ON GOOGLE, AND I WENT ALL RIGHT, WELL, ALEXANDER HAMILTON, HIP-HOP MUSICAL. SOMEONE'S DONE THIS. NO. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT I DID. AND I FIGURED, SOMEONE'S ALREADY DONE AND IT. NO ONE HAD DONE IT.
Jimmy: NOW WHY WOULD THEY DO IT? THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT -- THAT'S THE GENIUS OF YOU. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?
WELL, FOR ME, IT WAS SUCH A A NO BRAINER. IT WAS -- THIS IS A GUY WHO USED WORDS TO GET EVERYWHERE. HE WROTE HIS WAY INTO WASHINGTON'S GOOD GRACES. HE CAUGHT BEEF WITH EVERY OTHER FOUNDING FATHER. JEFFERSON HATED HIM, ADAMS HATED HIM. AND THEN THE VICE PRESIDENT SHOT HIM. YOU KNOW, DICK CHENEY WAS NOT THE FIRST VICE PRESIDENT TO SHOOT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M LEARNING ALREADY. JUST, I REMEMBER SEEING THE SHOW AND I GOT TO SEE AFTERWARDS, I WENT WITH MY WIFE. JUST BLOWN AWAY.

Jimmy: THAT'S GONNA CHANGE -- YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE NEXT LIN-MANUEL. HOPEFULLY YOU'RE GOING TO INSPIRE THESE KIDS. I MEAN, IMAGINE BEING A HISTORY TEACHER RIGHT NOW, GOING, "THIS IS BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME."
BUT IT'S ALSO SELFISH, BECAUSE TEENAGE AUDIENCES CAN'T LIE. THEY'RE THE MOST INCREDIBLE AUDIENCES WE HAVE. AND, YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER BEING A TEENAGE AUDIENCE AND SEEING SHOWS. AND IF SOMETHING WAS BAD, YOU'RE LIKE, WHACK! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS WHACK.
