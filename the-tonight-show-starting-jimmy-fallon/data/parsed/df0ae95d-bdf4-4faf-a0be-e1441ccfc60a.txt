PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE SOME PEOPLE MAD ON FRIDAY, AS HE WAS SPOTTED CHEWING GUM DURING A A CEREMONY TO COMMEMORATE D-DAY. OF COURSE MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T NOTICED, BECAUSE THEY WERE DISTRACTED BY BIDEN EATING A A TOOTSIE POP. HE'S LIKE -- [ CRUNCHING ] TWO LICKS AND ONE CRUNCH. I TOLD YOU. THAT'S RIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA FACED SOME CRITICISM FOR CHEWING GUM DURING A D-DAY CEREMONY. HE'S LIKE SORRY, BUT IF I DON'T GET MY NICORETTE THERE IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER WAR ON THIS BEACH. [ LAUGHTER ] GET THIS, IN A NEW INTERVIEW HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT SHE WANTS TO TRAVEL THIS YEAR AND WON'T MAKE ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT PLANS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT UNTIL 2015. WHEN ASKED WHERE SHE'LL TRAVEL SHE SAID, NEW HAMPSHIRE, IOWA, MAYBE SPEND A FEW MONTHS IN FLORIDA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE THIS COUNTRY SO MUCH, I'M PROBABLY GOING TO VACATION HERE.

THEY CAN NEITHER CONFIRM OR DENY THIS IS OUR FIRST TWEET -- SOME PEOPLE WERE UPSET ABOUT THE CUTESY NATURE OF THE TWEET. I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS SUCH A A BIG DEAL. I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY. BUT ANYWAY, THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING. BECAUSE NOW SEVERAL OTHER AGENCIES RECENTLY JOINED TWITTER AS WELL AND THEIR TWEETS ARE EVEN JOKEIER.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH, LIKE TAKE A A LOOK HERE. FIRST THE NSA TWEETED, "SORRY TO BUG YOU #NOTSORRY #WESEEEVERYTHING."

THEY GOT SERIOUS TOWARD THE END AND FINALLY THE CENSUS BUREAU TWEETED, RT IF YOU LIVE IN AMERICA #CENSUS #DONE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S JUST LAZY. YOU'RE MAKING US DO THE WORK. THE OTHER BIG STORY, A HORSE NAMED TONALIST WON THE BELMONT STAKES ON SATURDAY RUINING CALIFORNIA CHROME'S DREAM OF A A TRIPLE CROWNED. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] THE OWNER OF CALIFORNIA CHROME WAS NOT HAPPY. IN FACT, HE WENT ON A RANT AND CALLED THE WINNING HORSE A A COWARD FOR NOT ALSO RUNNING IN THE KENTUCKY DERBY OR THE PREAKNESS. THEN HORSE WAS LIKE, AND NEITHER DID YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] THE HORSE DID ALL THE WORK.
Steve: YEAH.

YEAH, IT WAS.
Jimmy: WE ACTUALLY -- WE HAVE A CLIP OF IT HERE, I WANT TO SHOW YOU.
DO YOU HAVE IT HERE?
Jimmy: YEAH.
WAS MUHAMMAD ALI ON THAT ONE, TOO?
MOST OF YOU PROBABKY KNOW CLINT FROM -- HE WAS SEVEN YEARS, STARRED IN THE TELEVISION SERIES "RAWHIDE." HE WENT TO ITALY AND BECAME ONE OF THE HOTTEST COWBOY STARS IN ALL OF EUROPE. WOULD YOU WELCOME MR. CLINT EASTWOOD. CLINT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE A GOOD LOOKING DUDE. YOU'RE A STUD THERE. ABSOLUTELY.

Jimmy: JUST A LITTLE BIT BLONDER NOW, YEAH. I ALWAYS ASSOCIATE YOU WITH WESTERNS AND CALIFORNIA, BUT HAVE YOU EVER LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY OR EVER SPENT TIME HERE?
YEAH, OVER THE YEARS. JUST PERIODICALLY.
Jimmy: OH YEAH, CHECK OUT THE JAZZ CLUBS? YOU'RE REALLY INTO JAZZ, AREN'T YOU?
I NEVER MADE THE GREAT DAYS OF THE 52nd STREET, BUT I COVERED A LOT OF THE WAY SINCE THEN. AND NOW "JERSEY BOYS", THIS IS BASED ON THE MUSICAL.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: WHICH IS ABOUT THE FOUR SEASONS, WHICH I LOVED. GOSH, I LOVED THE MOVIE.
I NOTICED IT BACK WHEN YOU WERE DOING THAT JERSEY ACCENT EARLIER. I THOUGHT "HE COULD HAVE BEEN IN THERE."
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. [ APPLAUSE ]
I THOUGHT YOU HAD IT.
Jimmy: DOES ANYONE HAVE A A TIME MACHINE? WE CAN GO BACK IN TIME. I WANT TO BE IN THIS.
GO BACK AND INSERT HIM INTO THE FILM.
Jimmy: HEY, TONY, ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME? HEY, TONY! ALL THE REFERENCES, I LOVED ALL THE REFERENCES LIKE THAT. BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE FROM BROOKLYN, I GREW UP WITH ALL DOO-WOP. WE HAVE A BUNCH OF CHARACTERS. YOU KNOW, EVERYONE TALKS LIKE THAT, A LOT OF SHOULDER SHRUGGING.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME OVER HERE? AND IT'S LITTLE DETAILS IN THIS MOVIE THAT MAKE YOU -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE "GOODFELLAS" MEETS, WELL, THE FOUR SEASONS, REALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE THEY GET INVOLVED WITH THE MAFIA, AND THE KID WHO IS THE NARRATOR -- I WROTE HIS NAME DOWN HERE, BECAUSE I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.
VINCE PIAZZA.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH, THIS GUY. VINCENT PIAZZA, UNBELIEVEABLE.
HE PLAYS THE TOMMY DeVITO CHARACTER, AND HE SORT OF NARRATES THE SHOW. WE KIND OF GO BACK THROUGH HIM.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THERE'S EVEN A TOMMY DeVITO STREET IN NEW JERSEY, NOW. SO, WHO KNOWS, YOU CAN GET A A STREET NAMED AFTER YOU.
Jimmy: IF ANYONE CAN DO IT, YEAH. HE'S GREAT IN THE MOVIE.
HE IS TERRIFIC.
Jimmy: EVERYONE'S PHENOMENAL IN THE MOVIE. WHOEVER DID THE SET, TOO, THE OLD CARS AND THE STREETS AND THE WAY YOU SHOT IT, IT LOOKED LIKE IT'S FROM THE '60s AND '70s. IT REMINDED ME OF WHEN MY PARENTS -- BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE -- NOT SATURATED, BUT THERE'S A A WAY OF SHOOTING THAT REMINDED ME OF MY PARENTS' WEDDING PHOTO. THIS IS MY PARENTS WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED IN BROOKLYN. JUST AS SOON AS THEY GOT MARRIED. LOOK, MY DAD'S GOT A CIGARETTE RIGHT THERE. HE NEEDED A SMOKE IMMEDIATELY. I DON'T KNOW WHY. HE HAD A PROBLEM --
THAT WAS THE DAY, EVERYONE SNUCK A SMOKE.
MOM IS STILL IN HER GOWN, LIKE WALKING DOWN. THEY'RE PROBABLY THROWING RICE AND HE WAS LIGHTING UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT IT REMINDED ME OF THE FRANKIE VALLI SCENE IN THAT FILM. ALSO WHEN FRANKIE FIRST MEETS HIS THEN WIFE, THEY GO TO A A PIZZERIA, AND SHE GOES "YOU COULD TELL THIS IS A GOOD PIZZERIA, BECAUSE THEY DON'T SELL IT BY THE SLICE." THAT'S SUCH A GOOD NEW YORK-NEW JERSEY THING.
BUT YOU KNOW, THE DILEMMA YOU HAVE WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A A FILM NOWADAYS, STUDIOS DON'T WANT YOU TO SHOW SMOKING, BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO COOPERATE WITH THE --
Jimmy: SURE.
-- THE ENVIRONMENT, YOU KNOW, AND DON'T SHOW SMOKING. BUT HOW DO YOU DO A PICTURE ABOUT THE '40s OR '50s WITHOUT HAVING PEOPLE SMOKING? OR THE '30S. EVERY MOVIE, YOU SAW PEOPLE CHUGGING THE BUTTS ALL THE TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. YEAH. SO MUCH SMOKE, YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE ROOM.
SO YOU HAVE TO DEFY THEIR WISHES.
Jimmy: WELL IT SEEMED LIKE -- WELL, I MEAN, DID YOU FIND THAT JAZZ CLUBS CHANGED WHEN THEY STOPPED SMOKING? HAVE YOU BEEN TO --
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: WHEN I DID STAND-UP COMEDY, WHEN I FIRST STARTED, SMOKE EVERYWHERE. I COULDN'T EVEN SEE THE CROWD.
YOU WOULD COME HOME AND TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF, THEY SMELLED LIKE HELL.
Jimmy: UNBELIEVEABLE, YEAH. YOU HAD TO GET THEM DRY CLEANED.
GET 'EM CLEANED ALL THE TIME.
Jimmy: EXACTLY, YEAH. WELL THEY GOT SOME GOOD SCENES IN THIS ONE TOO. THE NOTES HE HITS -- ARE THE ACTORS SINGING?
YEAH, THE ACTORS ARE SINGING, WE DID EVERYTHING LIVE. WE HAD A SMALL GROUP PLAYING OFFSTAGE AND THE COMPANY DID EVERYTHING LIVE.
Jimmy: GOSH.
BUT MOST OF THE ACTORS, JOHN LLOYD YOUNG AND ALL THE GUYS HAD SUNG IN THE PLAY, A A LOT OF THEM HAD.
Jimmy: THEY DID.
VINCE HADN'T BEEN, AND CHRISTOPHER WALKEN HADN'T BEEN IN THE PLAY, BUT THE REST OF THEM ARE ALL FROM THE PLAY.
Jimmy: AND HOW WAS CHRISTOPHER WALKEN TO -- HAD YOU EVER WALKED WITH HIM?
NOT BEFORE THIS, NO.
Jimmy: WILL YOU EVER WORK WITH HIM AGAIN?
NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, HE'S THE GREATEST GUY.
NO, I'M KIDDING. I'M KIDDING.
Jimmy: DID HE EVER GIVE ANY --
HE MARCHES TO HIS OWN DRUMMER, BUT IT'S A GREAT DRUMMER. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE IS GREAT. HE'S SO GOOD. OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE HE WAS ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE", I WAS WONDERING IF HE TRIED TO GIVE OUT LITTLE DIRECTIONS, BECAUSE HE WOULD DO THAT IN "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." HE WOULD BE LIKE -- [ AS WALKEN ] "JIMMY, NO, WE SHOULD MAYBE ENTER FROM THAT DOOR OVER THERE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN WHEN HE CAME ON, HE WOULD HIT HIS MARK, OF COURSE, HE'S A VERY PROFESSIONAL GUY. AND HE WOULD JUST READ THE CUE CARDS. WHEREEVER THE CUE CARDS WERE, HE WOULD READ THEM. SO, WHEREVER THEY WERE, HE WOULD READ THEM. SO, IN THE SCENE I WAS IN, WE'RE TALKING TO EACH OTHER, SUPPOSEDLY, HE'S LOOKING AT CUE CARDS THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS LIKE -- [ AS WALKEN ] "NO, SIR, I'VE GOT TO HAVE YOU LEAVE MY APARTMENT RIGHT NOW. YOU HAVE TO GO." HE'S NOT LOOKING AT ME AT ALL. BUT IT MADE IT FUNNIER, AND HE WAS GREAT.
I KNOW. THERE'S A CERTAIN KILTER HE PUTS ON IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. YEAH. HE'S LIKE -- IT'S LIKE AN INNOCENCE TO IT, BUT HE'S PERFECT IN THE MOVIE, AND HE'S VERY NEW JERSEY. IT'S JUST -- IF YOU LIKE "GOODFELLAS" AND YOU LIKE GOOD MUSIC, YOU'LL LOVE IT.
WELL HE'S BASED ON A REAL CHARACTER, TOO. GYP DeCARLO, WHO WAS THE HEAD OF A -- SORT OF A BIG MOBSTER IN THOSE PARTICULAR DAYS IN NEW JERSEY. HE SORT OF ADOPTED FRANKIE VALLI. AND BECAUSE FRANKIE VALLI WAS SMALL, HE SORT OF WAS HIS PROTECTOR. AND SO IT WAS AN INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP. BUT PROBABLY A LOT OF HIS SUCCESS WAS DUE TO BEING PROTECTED BY THIS GUY, AND HE COULD GO AHEAD TO BE SINGERS, TO BE FOUR GUYS THAT WANT TO BE SINGERS IN NEW JERSEY AT THAT TIME, YOU KNOW, THAT'S ROUGH STUFF. YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE FOUR SEASONS WERE IN THAT MUCH IN THE MOB AND THEY OWED MONEY, AND IT WAS CRAZY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: MY DAD WOULD SING DOO-WOP ON THE CORNERS IN BROOKLYN, AND THEN HE WAS ALSO IN A GANG.
I COULD TELL BY THE CIGS.
Jimmy: HE WAS A TOUGH DUDE, YEAH. HE WOULD LIKE GO AND LIKE GET IN FIGHTS, AND THEN HE'D BE LIKE -- BLOODY KNUCKLES OR SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME BACK THEN, YOU KNOW. BUT IT'S SUPER FUN, YOU GUYS GOT TO CHECK IT OUT. HERE'S A CLIP OF DIRECTOR CLINT EASTWOOD'S NEW FILM "JERSEY BOYS." TAKE A LOOK.

Jimmy: SEEING THAT.
-- COMING ACROSS NEIL IN A A CLOSET.
Jimmy: IT WAS THE ODDEST THING YOU'VE EVER SEEN ON TELEVISION. IT WAS REALLY CRAZY.
THAT'S A RECORD.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE EXACT RECORD, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK "CRAZY", WILLIE NELSON, PATSY CLINE, AND NOW THIS, THIS IS YOUR RECORD RIGHT HERE, "LAZARETTO." IT'S OUT MIDNIGHT -- IT'S ACTUALLY OUT NOW, WHEN THIS SHOW AIRS, RIGHT NOW, MIDNIGHT, THIS IS RELEASED. YOU'VE GOT TO BE PROUD OF THIS GUY. I LOVE THE TITLE TRACK, IT WAS GREAT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: BUT THIS RIGHT HERE, THIS IS THE ULTRA-LP --
YEAH.
Jimmy: SO THIS IS THE ULTRA-VINYL. YOU GUYS HAVE TO SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THIS. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS TO A VINYL. YOU HAVE TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.
YOU MEAN LIKE SOME CLOWN SHOES?
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. SO, LOOK, HERE'S THE VINYL. FIRST OF ALL, IT'S GOT A FLAT EDGE TO IT, WHICH NORMALLY IS POINTY. THIS IS FLAT.
LIKE AN OLD 78. FLAT EDGE.
Jimmy: YEAH. 180 GRAMS. HEAVY, TOO.
ONE SIDE IS GLOSSY, AND THE OTHER SIDE IS MATTE FINISH. THAT'S THE GLOSSY SIDE, AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE IS MATTE FINISH, LIKE AN OLD 78.
Jimmy: AND THEN, THIS IS THE THING THAT'S CRAZY. SEE THE LABEL RIGHT HERE, GUYS? THAT'S ACTUALLY A SONG.
YOU CAN PUT THE NEEDLE RIGHT ON THE PAPER OF THE RECORD AND IT WILL PLAY THROUGH THE PAPER. THE PAPER IS SUCKED INTO THE GROOVES OF THE RECORD AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR SONGS THROUGH THEM.
Jimmy: THAT IS AWESOME. [ APPLAUSE ] IT HAS SO MANY TRICKS. HOW MANY TRICKS DID YOU DO ON THIS? THERE'S A HIDDEN -- IT'S SO FUN. THANK GOD FOR JACK WHITE. THERE'S A HIDDEN. THERE'S HIDDEN TRACKS.
ALL RIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.
Jimmy: NO, NO. WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, YOU HAVE A HIDDEN TRACK AND A A 78 TRACK.
SIDE ONE STARTS ON THE INSIDE, YOU PUT THE NEEDLE ON THE INSIDE AND IT GOES OUTWARDS. SIDE TWO DOES IT LIKE A REGULAR RECORD. IT'S ALSO THE FIRST --
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE INSANE!
IT'S ALSO THE FIRST VINYL RECORD TO HAVE AN ETCHED HOLOGRAM, A METAL ETCHING HOLOGRAM OF AN ANGEL SPINNING. YOU WOULD HAVE TO SPIN THE RECORD TO SHOW IT, LIKE ON A A TURNTABLE.
Jimmy: OH, OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT HERE YOU CAN'T SEE, BUT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU, THIS IS LIKE SCRATCHING --
THIS ARTIST, TRISTAN DUKE, HE DOES METAL ETCHING. I DON'T KNOW HE DOES IT, BUT HE MAKES A HOLOGRAM. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO CATCH A A GLIMPSE OF IT, BUT YOU HAVE TO SPIN IT ON A TURNTABLE. THEY'LL CUT TO COMMERCIAL AND THEY'LL SHOW IT LATER, YOU CAN FILM IT OR SOMETHING.
Jimmy: MAYBE WE'LL FILM IT. IT'S KIND OF INSANE THAT YOU WENT TO ALL THE THIS LENGTH JUST TO MAKE SUCH A FUN, COOL THING. THERE'S ANOTHER TRACK THAT DEPENDS -- THE SONG CHANGES DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU DROP THE NEEDLE.
THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST THAT'S BEEN DONE, TOO. ON ONE SIDE.
Jimmy: THIS IS SO FUN! I'VE JUST GOT TO GET A RECORD PLAYER. AND THEN --
YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME OF OLD THE MONTY PYTHON RECORDS.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
THEY HAD ONE CALLED "MATCHING TIE AND HANDKERCHIEF AND THAT WAS TWO DIFFERENT GROOVES -- IT WAS CALLED A THREE-SIDED ALBUM --
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
-- WITH TWO DIFFERENT GROOVES ON ONE SIDE, NEXT TO EACH OTHER. WE DID THAT ON THE FIRST SONG HERE, BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY TWO DIFFERENT PARTS OF A SONG, AND THEY COME TOGETHER INTO ONE GROOVE AND FINISH A SONG. THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE.
Jimmy: AND THEN, ALSO, IS THIS THE FIRST RECORD THAT IS 33 SOME SONGS, OR 45, OR SOME ARE 78?
THAT'S RIGHT. IT ALSO MAKES PIZZA AND DRIVES YOU TO WORK IN THE MORNING.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH! WE'VE ONLY GOT TEN MORE IN STOCK. WE'VE ONLY GOT TEN MORE IN STOCK. I'M SORRY, I'M TALKING TO EVERYBODY -- WE'VE GOT TEN MORE, WE'VE GOT TO GO. CONGRATS ON THIS THING. AND THIS IS, UH -- I WAS LOOKING AT THE LINER NOTES AND I WAS LISTENING TO --
THIS IS WATER, RIGHT?
Jimmy: YES, THAT IS WATER. THEY DON'T LET ME DRINK ANYMORE ON THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WAS LISTENING TO THE RECORD TODAY, IT SOUNDS GREAT. THERE'S ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT SOUNDS, LIKE CRAZY GOOD ROCK, CRAZY GUITAR SOLOS, A COUNTRY JAM ON THERE. IT'S GOOD. AND THEN I WAS READING THE LINER NOTES AND I WAS READING YOUR THANK-YOUS IN PARTICULAR, AND IT KIND OF MADE ME LAUGH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU THANKED FOOD. AND STARTS GOING OFF ON DIFFERENT TANGENTS. IT REALLY MADE ME LAUGH.
WHO ELSE DID YOU FIND IN THERE?
Jimmy: YEAH, WELL, I FOUND THERE -- I SAW PAUL SIMON, BOB DYLAN, JUST PEOPLE THAT YOU LIKE.
UP-AND-COMING SONGWRITERS.
Jimmy: SOME UP-AND-COMING GUYS? I HAVEN'T HEARD OF PAUL SIMON AND BOB DYLAN. ALSO, ALL THE LYRICS, I WAS LOOKING AT THAT. AND AS I WAS RESEARCHING, I SAW SOMEWHERE THAT YOU KIND OF COWROTE THESE SONGS. YOU WROTE THE SONGS WITH YOURSELF. SONGS YOU WROTE -- ANOTHER RECORD-BREAKING THING. BUT 19-YEAR-OLD JACK WHITE.
YEAH, WELL, I WORKED A LONG TIME ON THIS RECORD. I USUALLY MAKE RECORDS IN A A COUPLE WEEKS, I TRY TO MAKE THEM IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. BUT THIS I WORKED FOR ABOUT A A YEAR AND A HALF ALMOST. AND I RECORDED SONGS THAT I DIDN'T WRITE VOCALS FOR FOR EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS ON SOME OF THOSE SONGS. SO, I WAS GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO START WRITING VOCALS. I'M SO DETACHED, NOW. IT'S ALMOST LIKE I'M WORKING WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S MUSIC, NOW, IT'S BEEN SO LONG. AND I JUST FOUND -- I WAS CLEANING OUT SOME THINGS IN THE ATTIC, AND I FOUND SOME WRITING I DID WHEN I WAS 19, WHICH IS ABOUT HALF MY AGE NOW. THEY WEREN'T VERY GOOD, THERE WERE JUST SORT OF WRITINGS, LIKE ONE-ACT PLAYS, AND POEMS, AND THINGS. AND I JUST PULLED A COUPLE CHARACTERS OUT OF THEM, AND I THOUGHT, WHAT IF I TEACH MYSELF HOW TO WRITE A SONG AS A A 19-YEAR-OLD. IF I HAD MY OLDER SELF TO TALK TO ME RIGHT NOW, WHAT WOULD -- HOW WOULD I HAVE TOLD MYSELF HOW TO WRITE SONG? SO THAT'S WHAT I DID THROUGH THOSE TRACKS. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
Jimmy: I JUST LOVE THAT YOU PUT THIS MUCH PASSION INTO YOUR RECORDS. YOU CAN TELL WHEN YOU GUYS HEAR WHAT HE PLAYS TONIGHT. JACK WHITE'S NEW RECORD, "LAZARETTO", IS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.
