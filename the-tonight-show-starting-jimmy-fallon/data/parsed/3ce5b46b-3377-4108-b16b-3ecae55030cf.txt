Jimmy: PLEASE SIT DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] DONALD TRUMP GAVE A BIG SPEECH IN DALLAS LAST NIGHT AND BEGAN BY POINTING OUT THAT HE WASN'T USING A TELEPROMPTER. THEN HE YELLED AT GARY BUSEY TO HOLD THE CUE CARDS HIGHER. [ LAUGHTER ] "SORRY, SIR, THIS -- PINEAPPLE SPACESHIP!" [ APPLAUSE ] SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE IS WEIGHING IN ON TRUMP. IN FACT THE CREATOR OF "DILBERT" -- DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? HE PREDICTED THAT TRUMP WILL WIN THE PRESIDENCY AND ALSO COMPARED HIM TO JESUS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND PEOPLE HOPE HE'S RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY WOULD LOVE A A THREE-DAY BREAK FROM DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] A LITTLE TINY -- JUST GIVE ME THREE DAYS. AND THIS ISN'T GOOD HERE.

BUT I SAW IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, HE SAID THAT HE FELT USED BY CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO HIM WHEN THEY NEED SOMETHING. THEN GOD WAS LIKE, "UM, HELLO. THAT'S 99% OF MY DAY." [ LAUGHTER ] "PLEASE MAKE MY FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM WIN. PLEASE, GOD!" [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, THE NFL SEASON DID JUST GET UNDER WAY, AND A LOT OF TEAMS HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT OPPONENTS SPYING ON THEIR PLAY CALLS DURING GAMES. I GUESS THAT'S A BIG SCANDAL NOW. PEOPLE ARE SPYING ON EACH OTHER'S PLAY CALLS. YEAH, SO TO KEEP THEIR PLAYS SECRET, THE COACHES ARE COMING UP WITH SIGNS THAT ARE HARDER AND HARDER TO FIGURE OUT. AND THIS IS REAL. WE DID NOT DOCTOR THIS. CHECK OUT THIS ONE THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES USED LAST NIGHT. WATCH.
