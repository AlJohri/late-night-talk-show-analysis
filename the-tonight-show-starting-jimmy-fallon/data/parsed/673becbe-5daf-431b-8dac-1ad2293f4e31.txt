LAST NIGHT ON "THE BACHELORETTE," JOJO, THAT'S THE BACHELORETTE, SHE HAD TO SEND MORE GUYS HOME. AND IT SEEMS LIKE A FEW OF THEM WERE HAVING A TOUGH TIME PUTTING THEIR FEELINGS INTO WORDS. LISTEN TO WHAT DANIEL HAD TO SAY AFTER HE DIDN'T GET A ROSE.
I KNOW I'M A GREAT CATCH. I'VE GOT MORE EXPERIENCES THAN ALL THESE GUYS HAVE COMBINED. BUT THERE'S MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. AND, YOU KNOW, THE CHANCE OF HER FALLING FOR ME, I GOT A A BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING STRUCK BY LIGHTNING WHILE, YOU KNOW, SHAVING MY FACE. [ LAUGHTER ]

[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, IF YOU TRAVEL A LOT, YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF CRAZY PLACES ON AIRBNB THAT YOU CAN RENT OUT FOR A NIGHT. BUT I'M NOT SURE I'VE EVER SEEN AN OFFER QUITE LIKE THIS ONE BEFORE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
BY DAY, SANBORN AND MARKET GAS IS A CONVENIENCE STORE. BUT BY NIGHT, IT'S AN AIRBNB RENTAL. TALKING ACCOMMODATIONS ON THE LISTING, SHEN SAYS, "CENTER TO TOWN. EASY FREEWAY ACCESS. ALL YOU CAN DRINK AND BRING YOUR OWN AIR MATTRESS." FOR JUST $50 TO $90 A NIGHT, OWNER PETE SHEN SAYS IT WILL FULFILL ANY CHILDHOOD DREAM OF SLEEPING AT A GAS STATION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT CHILD DREAMS OF SLEEPING IN A GAS STATION? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I THINK THAT'S JUST A 24-HOUR GAS STATION THAT'S TRICKING PEOPLE INTO WORKING THERE.
Steve: YEAH.

GOOD TO SEE YOU, BROTHER.
Jimmy: HOW ARE YOU, PAL?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Jimmy: ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUDDY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE WE DOING TODAY? WE GOT SOME FUN STUFF.
WE DO, WE DO. WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT FORCE. AND WHEN I SAY FORCE, I MEAN, LIKE, A PUSH OR A PULL THAT CREATES A CHANGE IN THE MOTION OF AN OBJECT.
Jimmy: OKAY.
OKAY. SO, JIMMY, YOU'RE AN OBJECT. SO --
Jimmy: THANK YOU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
THE FORCE OF GRAVITY -- YEAH.
Jimmy: THANKS.
THE FORCE OF GRAVITY IS KEEPING YOU ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: OKAY.
BUT IF WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING, LIKE, GO TO THE MOON, WE NEED A FORCE TO PROPEL US AWAY FROM EARTH. RIGHT?
Jimmy: ARE YOU GONNA TO PROPEL ME SOMEWHERE?
WELL, NO. NO, NO, NO.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD.
BUT SINCE I CAME FROM LITTLE ROCK, I BROUGHT A LITTLE ROCKET, SO WE HAVE A LITTLE ROCKET.
Jimmy: OKAY.
SO MOST ROCKETS, YOU KNOW, OPERATE UNDER A COMBUSTION THAT CREATES A HIGH- PRESSURE, HOT GASES THAT PUSH THE ROCKET UP, RIGHT?
Jimmy: SURE.
SO WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A A SIMILAR EFFECT USING LIQUID NITROGEN.
Jimmy: I LOVE LIQUID NITROGEN.
SO WE'RE GONNA ALLOW NITROGEN TO BOIL. SO NITROGEN, AS A GAS, MAKES UP AROUND 80% OF THE AIR YOU FEEL WHEN YOU DO THIS, WHEN YOU WAVE YOUR HANDS BACK AND FORTH.
Jimmy: I KNEW THAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
BUT, WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, WE'RE GONNA OBSERVE LIQUID NITROGEN, WHICH TAKES UP A LOT LESS SPACE, AND IT'S REALLY COLD.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO, WE'RE GOING TO BOIL IT. THE BOILING POINT OF LIQUID NITROGEN IS AROUND -321 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.
Jimmy: SO WHAT WILL DO IT DO WHEN IT -- WELL I GUESS --
WE'LL FIND OUT.
Jimmy: OKAY.
WE'LL FIND OUT, ALL RIGHT. SO YOU'RE GOING TO POUR THE NITROGEN INTO THIS BOTTLE.
Jimmy: OKEY-DOKE.
OKAY. AND I'VE GOT THE FUNNEL HERE. SO GO AHEAD AND POUR IT IN. I'LL TELL YOU WHEN TO STOP.
Jimmy: OKAY.
OH, THERE YOU GO, YEAH.
Jimmy: AM I DOING IT?
SO THIS IS ABOUT FOUR OUT OF FIVE EVERY MOLECULES THAT YOU BREATHE IN IS NITROGEN GAS. SO DON'T BREATHE ANY MORE IN.
Jimmy: AM I NOT BREATHING NOW? I'M NOT BREATHING RIGHT NOW.
YOU SOUND -- YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE YOU ARE.
Jimmy: I'M SORRY.
ALL RIGHT, A LITTLE BIT MORE. A LITTLE BIT MORE.
Jimmy: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, AND THEN, WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE GOOD.
Jimmy: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, SO NOW, WE'RE GONNA PRESSURIZE THIS BY PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF A CORK ON IT.
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
RIGHT? AND THEN THAT SHOULD GIVE US THE PROPULSION THAT WE NEED TO GET THE ROCKET AWAY FROM US.
Jimmy: BE CAREFUL.
SO -- I'LL BE CAREFUL. DON'T WORRY, I GOT A HAMMER. [ HAMMERING ] ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO. SO IN JUST A COUPLE SECONDS, THAT PRESSURE'S GONNA --
Jimmy: WHOA! [ LAUGHTER ]
FIRE OFF THE ROCKET. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU OKAY?
Jimmy: I THOUGHT -- YEAH. I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA GO THAT WAY. CAN WE SEE THAT IN SLOW MOTION? LOOK AT THIS THING.
WOW.
Jimmy: WHOA. [ LAUGHTER ] I WASN'T THAT SCARED.
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
Jimmy: I WASN'T THAT SCARED.
DID PRETTY GOOD.
Jimmy: I WAS ACTING FOR THE AUDIENCE, OF COURSE.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] AND DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE, DON'T TRY IT AT HOME.
IF YOU HAVE LIQUID NITROGEN AT HOME, DON'T TRY IT.
Jimmy: WHAT IS THIS THING, NOW?
PUT THIS ON.
Jimmy: OKAY.
OKAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT IS 2016, JIMMY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
HOVER BOARDS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO RIDE A HOVER BOARD?
Jimmy: NO.
WELL, I BROUGHT A HOVER BOARD.
Jimmy: WELL THIS IS ONE'S -- THESE ARE THE ONES THAT --
NO, NO, NO. IT'S NOT ONE OF THE ONES WITH THE WHEELS, THE POPULAR CHRISTMAS TOY THAT EXPLODES VERY SUDDENLY.
Jimmy: YES, THAT ONE, YEAH.
NOT ONE OF THOSE.
Jimmy: NO, YEAH, I DON'T WANNA DO THAT.
COME UP THIS WAY.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU GOT? OH.
SO MY FRIENDS FROM ARX PAX LENT US THE HENDO HOVERBOARD RIGHT HERE.
Jimmy: HEY, GUYS. NICE TO SEE YA.
SO, YOU HAVE YOUR HELMET ON, OKAY?
Jimmy: YEP.
SO, YOU CAN -- KYLE, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TURN IT ON. AND THEN, WE'LL LISTEN TO IT REV UP. NOW, THIS IS HOVERING ABOUT AN INCH OFF THE GROUND. THIS IS NOT ON WHEELS, JIMMY. THIS IS JUST -- THERE'S, YOU KNOW, THE FLOOR BENEATH IT.
Jimmy: HOW ARE THESE --
ALL RIGHT. SO GRAB ONTO MY SHOULDER. GO AHEAD AND STEP UP.
Jimmy: OKAY.
OKAY, THERE YOU GO. NOW, KYLE --
Jimmy: YOU CAN TELL I'M A A BOARDER.
AND SHANNA ARE GONNA PUSH YOU BACK AND FORTH.
Jimmy: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT? BACK AND FORTH TO THE FUTURE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
ALL RIGHT. SO GO AHEAD. PUSH HIM THIS WAY. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS EACH ONE OF THE HOVER ENGINES IS CREATING A DYNAMIC MAGNETIC FIELD, RIGHT?
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
THAT'S CAUSING THE COPPER TO BECOME AN ELECTROMAGNET.
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND THAT MAGNETIC FIELD FROM THE COPPER IS POLARIZING AGAINST THE HOVER ENGINE CREATING THAT SORT OF HOVER.
Jimmy: I WANNA GET OFF.
OKAY, YOU CAN GET OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
YOU'VE RESCUED HILL VALLEY! GOOD JOB!
Jimmy: THANK YOU. OKAY. I GOTTA CALL DOC. KYLE, HURRY UP WITH THE THING!

THANK YOU, GUYS. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WOW, WOW, WOW. WOW, THAT FELT WEIRD. THAT WAS WILD.
IT WAS PRETTY GOOD. IT WAS PRETTY GOOD.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT.
AND IT DIDN'T BLOW UP.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T BLOW -- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: BUT SOMETHING'S ABOUT TO EXPLODE HERE.
SOMETHING IS, YEAH, YEAH. SO I BROUGHT SOME ALKA-SELTZER.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
YOU REMEMBER ALKA-SELTZER?
Jimmy: I HAS SOME BEFORE THE SHOW YEAH.
OKAY.
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
POP, POP, FIZZ, FIZZ.
Jimmy: YEAH.
ALL THAT STUFF, OKAY. SO ALKA-SELTZER HAS A LITTLE BIT SODIUM BICARBONATE AND SOME CITRIC ACID IN IT. SO WE'RE GONNA CAUSE A CHEMICAL REACTION WHEN WE DROP IT INTO THE WATER THAT CREATES A LOT OF CARBON DIOXIDE BUBBLES THAT BUILD UP A LOT OF GAS. WE'RE GOING TO PRESSURIZE THAT GAS AND ALLOW THAT CANISTER TO POP RIGHT UP.
Jimmy: SO JUST LIKE A A LITTLE --
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S A FILM CANISTER?
JUST A FILM CANISTER.
Jimmy: OKAY.
THOSE ARE STILL AROUND, I GUESS.
Jimmy: SURE.
ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT.
SO, THERE WE GO.
Jimmy: ALKA-SELTZERS IN THERE.
SO NOW ALL THAT CARBON DIOXIDE GAS IS GONNA BUILD UP A A LITTLE BIT PRESSURE, AND THAT FORCE IS GOING TO PUSH THE CANISTER RIGHT UP IN THE AIR. IT'S A LITTLE -- [ POP ] YEAH.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: NO. I MEAN, THAT WAS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE.
YEAH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jimmy: I THOUGHT THAT WAS ENOUGH.

Jimmy: 1,000 OF THESE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: NOW, RIGHT NOW --
OVER 1,000.
Jimmy: SO THE ALKA-SELTZER'S ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT NOW, YEAH?
RIGHT. RIGHT NOW, THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON. WHEN WE TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN, THE WATER'S GOING TO MIX WITH THE CARBON -- THE SODIUM BICARBONATE INSIDE THERE, AND IT'S GONNA, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: EXPLODE.
EXPLODE. OKAY.
Jimmy: THIS IS REALLY FUN.
READY?
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, WHICH WAY ARE WE TURNING IT?
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA TURN IT TOWARD THE AUDIENCE, BUT HANG ON A SECOND. I GOTTA PULL THE PIN. IT'S LIKE A GRENADE.
Jimmy: YEP.
