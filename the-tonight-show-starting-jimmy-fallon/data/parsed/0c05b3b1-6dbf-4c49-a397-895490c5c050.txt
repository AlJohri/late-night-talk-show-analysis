YESTERDAY TEXAS SENATOR TED CRUZ OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. YEAH. CRUZ SAID THAT AFTER DOING EXHAUSTIVE RESEARCH TO SEE IF HE HAD A REAL CHANCE TO WIN, HE SAID, "SCREW IT I'M GOING TO RUN ANY WAY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND I GUESS THAT'S THE ATTITUDE. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE RIGHT ATTITUDE. THAT'S RIGHT, REPUBLICAN TED CRUZ ANNOUNCED HE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016. SO FINALLY, CARNIVAL IS NO LONGER THE MOST DANGEROUS CRUISE IN AMERICA.

PRESIDENT." THAT'S PRETTY SHOCKING. BECAUSE I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW OBAMA COULD GET MAD. HE'S LIKE, "I'M VERY ANGRY RIGHT NOW." [ LAUGHTER ] "MAD AS HECK. REALLY, REALLY MAD." [ LAUGHTER ] "HULK SMASH." [ LAUGHTER ] HULK SMASH? WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?
Steve: WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?
Jimmy: "YOU WON'T LIKE ME WHEN I'M ANGRY." [ LAUGHTER ] LISTEN TO THIS.

YEAH. IT'S THE BEST TOURNAMENT WE HAVE ALL YEAR AND THE GOLF COURSE IS ALWAYS IN PERFECT SHAPE.
Jimmy: IS IT TRUE YOU'VE NEVER TAKEN A LESSON?
NEVER TAKEN A LESSON. JUST LEARNED IT ALL MYSELF.
Jimmy: WOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THERE'S HOPE -- THERE'S HOPE FOR ME. HOW LATE CAN YOU START? AROUND 40? [ LAUGHTER ] NO, WHEN DID YOU START? WHEN --
6 YEARS OLD.
Jimmy: AND WHAT HAPPENED? YOUR DAD --
MY DAD PLAYED WITH HIS BUDDIES ON THE WEEKEND, USUALLY ON SATURDAY. AND MY MOM SAID YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR SON IF YOU WANT TO PLAY. HE SAID NO, BUT SHE WAS THE BOSS SO --
Jimmy: MOM ALWAYS WINS. ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. SO HE TOOK YOU WITH AND YOU SAW THAT YOU LIKED THE GAME?
YEAH, I STARTED PLAYING. I USED HIM AS LIKE A MIRROR. BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT-HANDED AND I'M LEFT-HANDED. AND SO I HAD ONE CLUB. AND JUST KIND OF WATCHED THE SWING. HE BARELY BROKE 100. SO FOR ME I JUST WATCHED HIS SWING TO GET THE BASICS. AND THEN I JUST LEARN FROM THERE.
Jimmy: HOW FUN WAS THAT? AND THEN YOU GOT REALLY, REALLY INTO IT. AROUND TEN, 12. WHAT THIS --
YEAH. AT A YOUNG AGE. I SHOT IN THE 60s AT AGE 12. I USED TO WEAR THE KNICKERS --
Jimmy: GOSH, LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS AGE EIGHT. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
PAYNE STEWART WAS MY FAVORITE.
Jimmy: LOOK AT THOSE BIG FEET. I LOVE THAT. I LOVE THAT AGE.
WELL THE BIGGER SHOES, THEY WERE CHEAPER. SO WE WENT WITH THE BIGGER.
Jimmy: NO, I HAD THE SAME THING. MY PARENTS WERE LIKE, STOP GROWING OUT OF YOUR SHOES. WE DON'T HAVE MONEY FOR THIS.
FOUR SIZES TOO BIG --
Jimmy: I HAD THE SAME SNEAKERS --
MY GRANDMA MADE THE KNICKERS FOR ME. SHE USED TO MAKE THOSE -- HAND MAKE THOSE.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: AH, COME ON. HOW COOL IS THAT?
THESE YELLOW ONES RIGHT HERE, THESE ACTUALLY HAD MICKEY MOUSE ON THE SIDE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S SO COOL, MAN. AND HERE YOU ARE NOW, I MEAN, WINNING THE MASTERS --
LIVING THE DREAM. WINNING A PIE CONTEST.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND YOU LOOK GREAT, TOO. I WANT TO SAY, THIS IS A -- THIS IS A GREAT INITIATIVE YOU'RE DOING NOW, CALLED DRIVECHIPANDPUTT.COM. GO ON THE WEBSITE, CHECK IT OUT. BUT THIS IS FOR --
ALL THE GOLF ORGANIZATIONS IN THE MASTERS AND THE MEMBERS AT AUGUSTA. THE FINAL IS AT AUGUSTA, THE SUNDAY BEFORE. SO 80 KIDS SHOW UP, IT'S FREE TO ANY KID TO PARTICIPATE, TO TRY TO MAKE IT TO THE MASTERS OR TO AUGUSTA TO PARTICIPATE. AND IT'S -- GOLF TO ME IS ALL ABOUT FAMILY. THESE KIDS OUT THERE TRYING TO QUALIFY FOR THIS, TO GET TO THE HOME OF GOLF, I MEAN THE MASTERS, THE AUGUSTA NATIONAL. 80 KIDS EVERY YEAR IS GOING TO MAKE IT THERE. IT'S FREE FOR EVERYBODY. FAMILIES GET INVOLVED. I GET TO MEET THE KIDS THIS YEAR. I MET THEM LAST YEAR FOR THE FIRST YEAR. IT'S FUN. I'LL BE THERE EVERY YEAR, KINDA JUST GREETING THEM AND SHAKING THEIR HANDS. AND I LEARN FROM THESE KIDS. THEY'RE SUCH AN INSPIRATION. SOMETIMES IN MY JOB I GET -- I FORGET ABOUT WHERE I COME FROM. AND YOU FORGET ABOUT HOW GREAT IT IS TO PLAY GOLF FOR A A LIVING. AND THESE KIDS HELP YOU REMEMBER THAT PRETTY QUICKLY.
Jimmy: WELL YOU HAVE KIDS OF YOUR OWN, YOUR SON. HOW OLD IS HE?
I HAVE A SON THAT JUST TURNED THREE AND I HAVE A A 4-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER AS WELL.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HOW'S YOUR 3-YEAR-OLD? DOES THE 3-YEAR-OLD KNOW WHO YOU ARE YET? DOES HE SAY, "OH, MY GOD, MY DAD'S BUBBA WATSON."
NO. BUT THE FUNNY STORY IS LAST WEEK I HAD A TOURNAMENT. SO I DID A CLINIC FOR THE TOURNAMENT AND 700 KIDS SHOWED UP. AND MY SON'S WATCHING ME AT THIS CLINIC. AND AT THE END OF IT I HAD TWO GOLF BALLS. AND HE GOES, "BUBBA, WILL YOU SIGN THESE?" [ LAUGHTER ] I SAID I'M DAD. HE GOES, "OKAY, DAD, WILL YOU SIGN THESE?"
Jimmy: SMART KID. YEAH.
HE WATCHED ALL THESE KIDS ASK FOR MY AUTOGRAPH. AND THEN HE FAKED LIKE HE HAS A A CAMERA. SO HE WAS LIKE, "SAY CHEESE. CAN I TAKE YOUR PICTURE?"
Jimmy: AT THREE YEARS OLD.
SO HE'S COPYING WHAT ALL THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING.
Jimmy: DO YOU THINK HE'S GOOD AT GOLF?
HE LOVES IT. WE LIVE RIGHT BY THE DRIVING RANGE. AND SO HE SAYS, I STARTED SAYING I'M GOING TO WORK AND SO NOW HE PICKS HIS GOLF CLUBS UP. HE'S LIKE, "DAD, I'VE GOT TO GO TO WORK." [ LAUGHTER ] JUST ABOUT EVERY AFTERNOON WE HIT BALLS.
Jimmy: AND I HEARD THIS OTHER THING ABOUT YOU, WHICH I THINK IS AWESOME. THAT YOU EAT TWO BURRITOS BEFORE -- THIS IS TRUE. LIKE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MASTERS YOU'VE EATEN TWO BURRITOS, AND THAT'S YOUR KEY, THAT'S YOUR LUCKY THING, YOU EAT BURRITOS AND YOU WIN. AND I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS.
IN 2012 WE ADOPTED CALEB THE WEEK BEFORE. MY WIFE DIDN'T GO. SO NOW I CAN EAT WHATEVER I WANTED TO EAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO I WENT BURRITO -- I EAT THE SAME THING.
Jimmy: BURRITO BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND DINNER?
YEAH. I COULD EASILY DO IT. SO I HAD A BURRITO OR TWO BURRITOS EVERY DAY, TEN DAYS STRAIGHT -- WHILE I WAS AT AUGUSTA.
Jimmy: WHAT KIND OF BURRITOS?
IT JUST DEPENDS. THERE'S TWO SHOPS THERE. THERE WAS A MOE'S AND THERE'S A -- BARBARITO'S. SO THERE'S TWO CHOICES.
Jimmy: MOE'S IS FANTASTIC.
YEAH. THE CHEEZ-IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE GOTTA TALK. SO THEN -- LAST YEAR 2 2014 MY WIFE WAS THERE THIS TIME. AND I'M LIKE, I'M GOING BACK TO THE BURRITOS. I HAD BURRITOS FOR ANOTHER TEN DAYS STRAIGHT, ONE OR TWO A A DAY. SO I WON AGAIN SO I THINK THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA DO THAT AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BURRITOS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE SOME BURRITOS FROM ONE OF THE GREATEST PLACES HERE IN NEW YORK, MISSION CANTINA. IT'S OUR PAL DANNY BOWIEN. DANNY BOWEIN, DO YOU WANT TO JUST HAVE A BITE OF BURRITO AND WISH YOU GOOD LUCK IN AUGUSTA.
WHAT KIND IS THIS?
Jimmy: I GOT CHICKEN ON THAT I GOT -- CARNITAS --
OH, PERFECT.
