THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. VERY EXCITED. I'M FROM NASHVILLE. YEAH. BIG WAL-MART FAN. I'M ON BOARD WITH THEM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I WENT TO WAL-MART RECENTLY, AND I WAS TALKING TO THIS GUY. I THINK HE WORKED THERE. I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW IF HE EVEN TOLD ANYBODY THAT HE WORKS THERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I WAS TRYING -- I WENT IN. I WAS TRYING TO BUY A HAMMOCK. SO I GO BACK TO WHERE I IMAGINE HAMMOCKS LIVE. I WAS LIKE, "HEY, MAN, DO YOU GUYS SELL HAMMOCKS?" HE GOES, "WHAT'S A HAMMOCK?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE, AM I SAYING IT WRONG? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I LITERALLY -- I WAS LIKE, I THINK I'M SAYING IT WRONG. I SWEAR, I GO, I THINK -- YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK IT'S HAMMOTT WITH A 'T.' I THINK I MESSED UP." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ONE T OR TWO Ts. I THINK IT'S HAMMOTT. AND THEN HE JUST GOES, "WE'RE OUT OF HAMMOTTS. WE'RE OUT OF THEM." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S HAMMOTT SEASON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO I WENT OUT TO MY CAR AND I GOOGLED WHERE TO BUY A HAMMOTT, AND THEN GOOGLE IS LIKE, "DO YOU MEAN HAMMOCK?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I WAS LIKE, I SURE DO, GOOGLE. WHERE WERE YOU DURING ALL OF THIS? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, YOU LEFT ME OUT THERE. I READ ON GOOGLE, I READ ABOUT THAT DENTIST WHO SHOT CECIL THE LION. YOU KNOW, HE WENT BACK TO WORK. AND I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T CARE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT IT IS LIKE, WHAT ARE THE ODDS YOU SHOOT A LION AND EVERYBODY IS LIKE, CECIL? NOT CECIL, RIGHT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] UNBELIEVABLE. THERE'S LIKE 30,000 LIONS. IT'S A ONE IN 30,000 CHANCE YOU SHOOT A LION WHERE LIKE MY BUDDY, CECIL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, THEY SHOULD HAVE PUT LIKE A STRIPE ON HIM OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] GIVE HIM A HAT. BE LIKE, DON'T SHOOT THE LION WITH THE TUXEDO JACKET. THAT'S OUR BEST FRIEND AND WE LOVE HIM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DO NO KIND OF HUNTING OR ANY KIND OF ACTIVITIES, REALLY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'VE HAD PEOPLE TELL ME I SHOULD LOSE WEIGHT. AND NOW WHAT I DO IS -- BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO LOSE WEIGHT. BUT I JUST TELL PEOPLE I USED TO WEIGH 300 POUNDS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. I LOOK PRETTY AMAZING FOR A GUY WHO USED TO WEIGH 300 POUNDS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GOT TIRED OF BEING TIRED. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I -- [ LAUGHTER ] I PLAYED SPORTS GROWING UP. WHEN I WAS 13, I WAS PLAYING BASEBALL. AND ONE TIME, I WAS UP TO BAT AND I GET WALKED. SO I TAKE MY BASE. AND WHEN I GOT TO FIRST BASE, I TURNED AROUND AND THE CATCHER WAS STILL HOLDING THE BALL. HE'S LIKE STARING AT ME, ALMOST LIKE HE WAS DARING ME TO RUN. LIKE, HE WAS LIKE, "GO. I BET YOU CAN'T MAKE IT." AND I WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, DUDE. I'M GOING TO GO." SO I RAN TO SECOND. HE THREW IT TO SECOND. OVER THE SECOND BASE. BALL GOES IN THE OUTFIELD. I RUN TO THIRD. THE OUTFIELDER GRABS THE BALL. THEY OVERTHROW THIRD BASE. SO THE COACH IS TELLING ME TO GO HOME. THIS IS ABOUT TO BE AN INSIDE THE PARK HOME RUN OFF A WALK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, I'M GOING TO BE ON "SPORTSCENTER." THIS IS THE BIGGEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN BASEBALL. AND I SLIDE TO THE PLATE, AND THEN THE UMPIRE SAYS IT WAS ONLY BALL THREE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] YEAH. SO AFTER LIKE -- I'M LIKE DIRTY FOR NO REASON. I'M LIKE, I GOT TO GRAB MY BAT, IT'S RIGHT WHERE I LEFT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] THREE BALLS, TWO STRIKES. NEXT PITCH, IMMEDIATELY STRIKE OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M EXHAUSTED. I'M OVER BASEBALL AS A GAME. AND THE UMPIRE IS LIKE, "YOU CAN GO." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NOW, I LEARNED SOMETHING. I LEARNED THAT IF YOU'RE CONFIDENT, YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH QUITE A BIT. BECAUSE NO ONE TRIED TO STOP ME, AND THEY SHOULD HAVE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY KNEW I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO GO. LIKE THAT'S WHY THE CATCHER WAS HOLDING THE BALL. 'CAUSE HE WAS LIKE, "I DON'T THINK HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOING, RIGHT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHY IS HE GOING?" AND THEN I JUST RUN TO SECOND. HE'S LIKE, "I GUESS I'M WRONG." YOU KNOW, NO ONE IS THAT DUMB. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND THEN HE JUST LAUNCHES THE BALL IN THE OUTFIELD. HE WAS BARELY WATCHING THE GAME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THE UMPIRE FIGURES IT OUT, BUT IT'S EASIER TO LET ME GET ALL THE WAY BACK TO HIM. YOU KNOW? LET ME FEEL WHAT IT WOULD FEEL LIKE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THE BEST? THE BEST WAS NO ONE TOLD THE PARENTS. THEY WERE LOSING THEIR MINDS, SCREAMING. WATCHING INSIDE THE PARK, THE HOME RUN. LIKE IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. AND THEN THEY JUST SEE ME STAND UP AND BAT AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND LIKE, NO IDEA. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
