IT'S --
Jimmy: THEY'RE TOUGH. TOUGH, TOUGH, TOUGH CROWD.
IT WAS AMAZING. I PERFORMED AN ACOUSTIC VERSION OF "STARVING" AND I SORT OF BUILT IN THIS BREAKDOWN WHERE I WOULD GIVE THE FANS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SORT OF SING THE SONG. AND SECONDS BEFORE I WENT ON STAGE, I WAS FIGHTING BACK TEARS FOR SO MANY REASONS. BUT I STARTED TO THINK, LIKE, NO ONE KNOWS THIS SONG. THIS IS GOING TO BE AWFUL. I'M GONNA PUT THE MIC OUT AND NO ONE'S GOING TO SAY ANYTHING.
Jimmy: NOW YOU SING!
OH, MY GOD. THERE'S NOTHING. BUT --
Jimmy: NO, YOU SING.
YEAH, THAT WAS LIKE MY BIGGEST FEAR. I WAS LITERALLY FIVE WORDS INTO THE SONG AND THEY JUST STARTED TO CARRY IT AND IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY. IT WAS AMAZING.
Jimmy: HOW FUN IS THAT? AND THEN YOU WENT ON TOUR WITH MEGHAN TRAINOR.
YES.
Jimmy: WAS THAT YOUR FIRST TOUR?
IT WAS MY FIRST TOUR EVER.
Jimmy: DID YOU GET THE TOUR BUS AND ALL THAT STUFF?
YES.

Jimmy: BUNK BEDS.

Jimmy: I LOVE IT, YEAH.
IT TOOK ME SOLID 30 MINUTES TO CHOOSE MY BUNK.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. HOW LONG WAS IT OUT -- HOW LONG WERE YOU AWAY FROM HOME?
WELL, IT WAS PROBABLY LIKE FOUR DAYS BUT IT FELT LIKE FOREVER --
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, BUT STILL --
IN THE BEST WAY. IT WAS A LITTLE OVER A MONTH, MAYBE TWO MONTHS OR SO.
Jimmy: THAT'S TOUGH TO BE AWAY FROM YOUR LIFE, LIVING OUT OF A BUS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: DID YOU -- DID YOU -- DID YOU SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR PARENTS AND JUST GO, "HEY, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS IN A COUPLE" --
WELL, MY MOM CAME WITH ME, WHICH WAS AWESOME.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE BEST.
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH IT WITHOUT HER.
Jimmy: HOW ABOUT DAD?
MY DAD STAYED BACK. BUT HE IS SO AWESOME. HE DOES THIS THING WHERE HE'LL SEND MY MOM AND I OFF WITH A A HANDWRITTEN CARD -- WHETHER WE'RE GONE FOR TWO DAYS, TWO MONTHS, TWO WEEKS WHATEVER. AND HE GOT WAY AHEAD OF HIMSELF AND WROTE OUT A CARD FOR EVERY CITY ON THE TOUR SO THAT I HAD A CARD TO OPEN BEFORE EVERY SHOW. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] RIGHT?

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE THINGS. BUT WE DO. IT'S CRUSHING. IT'S SAD, BUT IT'S REALLY FUNNY. AND IT'S -- YEAH. TOUGH BEING A TEENAGER, BEING A A 17-YEAR-OLD. YOU'RE IN THIS WITH WOODY HARRELSON, PLAYS YOUR HISTORY TEACHER.

Jimmy: YOU COULD TELL YOU GUYS LIKED EACH OTHER, BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A GREAT RAPPORT YOU GUYS HAVE. BUT YOU WERE TELLING ME THAT YOU GUYS BROKE A LOT. LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN THE SCENES AND LAUGH.
THERE WAS A -- YES. THERE WAS ONE SPECIFIC SCENE WHERE, FOR WHATEVER REASON, THAT DAY, I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAD JUST ALL JUST CAUGHT UP TO US IN THAT MOMENT, BUT WE -- I HAVE NEVER SEEN A HUMAN'S FACE MORE RED IN MY LIFE, HE WAS LAUGHING SO HARD --
