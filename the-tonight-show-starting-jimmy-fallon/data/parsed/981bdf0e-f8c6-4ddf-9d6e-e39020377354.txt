Jimmy: THAT'S A HOT CROWD. WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW" EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. IT'S GONNA BE A FUN SHOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HERE IS WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. ACROSS THE STREET IS THE NFL DRAFT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL. 32 PLAYERS WERE DRAFTED IN THE FIRST ROUND. ACTUALLY 31, THE JETS GOT CONFUSED AND TOOK ONE OF THE ROCKETTES. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT A GOOD KICKER THOUGH. AMAZING. 32 PLAYERS DRAFTED INTO THE NFL. THOUGH I THOUGHT IT WAS A A LITTLE WEIRD WHEN THE TEAM OWNERS HANDED EACH OF THEM A A ROSE. WILL YOU ACCEPT THIS ROSE? [ LAUGHTER ] WELCOME TO THE HOUSTON TEXANS. DID YOU HEAR? ONE OF THE PROSPECTS IN THIS YEARS NFL DRAFT IS A SAFETY NAMED HA HA CLINTON-DIX. ♪♪ NO I'M NOT KIDDING. THAT'S THE REAL -- I'M NOT -- THAT'S NOT A JOKE, THAT'S NOT A A JOKE. HIS NAME -- [ LAUGHTER ] STOP LAUGHING. IT IS NOT -- NAME -- HIS NAME IS HA HA CLINTON-DIX. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH INCIDENTALLY IS THE TITLE OF THE NEW "VANITY FAIR" ARTICLE BY MONICA LEWINSKY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: IT IS DONE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. HA HA CLINTON-DIX. OF COURSE THAT'S JUST HIS NICKNAME. HIS REAL NAME IS TEE HEE CLINTON-PENIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: I HEARD THAT HIS JERSEY NUMBER WAS 69. [ LAUGHTER ] WAS HE -- [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT SOMEONE'S REAL LAUGH?
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: IS THERE A WILD ANIMAL LOOSE IN THE AUDIENCE? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HEAR IT? EVERYONE STOP SO WE CAN HEAR HER. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A GREAT LAUGH. THANK YOU, I LOVE THAT LAUGH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A GREAT LAUGH. WITH THE DRAFT HAPPENING RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET THE SIDEWALKS OUTSIDE WERE PACKED WITH FOOTBALL FANS. SO WE SENT OUR WRITER ARTHUR DOWN THERE TO GET SOME OPINIONS ON THE DRAFT. THE ONLY CATCH WAS THEY HAD TO DANCE THE ENTIRE TIME AS THEY ANSWERED. WE CALL IT "QUESTIONS AND DANCERS." TAKE A LOOK. ♪♪
WHAT IS YOUR TEAM STRATEGY GOING INTO THE DRAFT?
SO THE PACKERS ALWAYS PICK THE BEST PLAYER AVAILABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS YEAR THEY WILL PROBABLY PICK DEFENSE.
YOU NEED SOMEONE LIKE -- LIKE AMURO OR MAYBE EVEN EBRON IF WE WANT TO TRADE UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK REALLY YOU SHOULD DRAFT OFFENSIVE LINE. AND IF OFFENSIVE LINE DOESN'T REALLY WORK. I THINK WE SHOULD GO GET A A LINEBACKER.
I THINK THE JETS NEED A WIDE OUT. AN OUTSIDE LINE BACKER. CORNERBACK OBVIOUSLY.
BUT I THINK THIS YEAR THEY GONNA COME THROUGH WITH STRONG PICKS AND STOP THE WORLD.
HOPEFULLY THE CHIEFS CAN TRADE BACK. THEY HAVE THE 23rd PICK BUT THEY ONLY HAVE SIX IN THE WHOLE DRAFT. PLUS IF THEY COULD GET A WIDE RECEIVER. I HOPE THEY GET A SKILLED POSITION PLAYER. MAYBE WE CAN GET A QUARTERBACK. WE HAVEN'T DRAFTED ONE IN THE FIRST ROUND SINCE LIKE 1985. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT, GUYS. AND I LOVE THIS CITY. IT IS THE BEST CITY. I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT -- I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT DANCE. THAT WAS GREAT. SPEAKING OF FOOTBALL OUR PALS OVER AT CBS THIS MORNING, WE LIKE THAT CREW. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT A A FORMER ARMY RANGER WHOSE JUST SIGNED BY THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES. [ APPLAUSE ] AND -- AND ANCHOR GALE KING, WE LOVE GALE KING. SHE DIDN'T DO TOO MUCH TO HIDE HER FEELINGS ABOUT THIS GUY. WATCH.

Steve: WOAH!
Jimmy: HEY A LITTLE TV GOSSIP HERE YOU GUYS. IT'S RUMORED THAT KATIE COURIC MIGHT RETURN TO THE TODAY SHOW FOR A FEW MONTHS TO FILL IN FOR SAVANNAH GURTHIE WHEN SHE GOES ON MATERNITY LEAVE. BECAUSE WHERE ELSE CAN YOU FIND ANOTHER CO-HOST SAID, AL, NATALIE, LESTER, CAMERON, WILLIE, CARSON, DILLON, KATHY LEE AND HODA. WHERE ELSE CAN YOU FIND SOMEONE TO FILL IN? [ APPLAUSE ] I ALSO SAW THAT NBC IS PAID OVER $7 BILLION TO BROADCAST THE OLYMPICS THROUGH 2032. WOW. HALF OF THE 7 BILLION WILL BE SPENT ON ADVERTISING AND THE REST BE SPENT ON VISINE FOR BOB COSTAS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: I FELT SO BAD FOR HIM. OH MY GOSH. THAT'S RIGHT, NBC WON THE BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR THE OLYMPICS FOR THE NEXT 18 YEARS. MEANWHILE CNN JUST WON THE BROADCAST RIGHTS TO COVER THAT MISSING PLANE FOR THE NEXT 18 YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] BREAKING NEWS, IT'S STILL MISSING. UH, THOUGHT WE SAW IT -- HERE'S SOME POLITICAL NEWS. DURING HIS SPEECH LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID IT'S IMPORTANT FOR DEMOCRATS TO WIN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS BECAUSE THE GOP SAYS NO TO EVERYTHING. REPUBLICAN SAYS NO WE -- GOOD ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU ALMOST -- ALMOST GOT US ON THAT ONE. SPEAKING OF OBAMA, A NEW REPORT SHOWS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS VISITED 45 STATES DURING HIS TIME IN OFFICE. WHEN HE HEARD THAT, BIDEN WAS LIKE WOW HE'S BEEN TO ALL OF THEM? [ LAUGHTER ] GO TO BED. GO TO BED. PAST YOUR BEDTIME BUDDY. WELL THIS IS CREATING A LOT OF CON-TROV-ER-SI. [ LAUGHTER ] OUR SHOW AIRS IN ENGLAND. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS CREATING A LOT OF CONTROVERSY. THIS WEEK NINTENDO ANNOUNCED IT WILL NOT ALLOW SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS IN A NEW VIDEO GAME DESPITE PRESSURE FROM FANS. AND THAN MARIO AND LUIGI SAID I GUESS WE HAVE TO KEEP ONE THIS WHOLE BROTHER CHARADE. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE WE GO.
Steve: IT'S A ME, MARIO. [ MUSHROOM SOUND ]
Jimmy: THIS IS KIND OF HARD TO BELIEVE. I HEARD THAT CHER RECENTLY TEAMED ONE WITH THE WU TANG CLAN FOR TWO OF THEIR NEW SONGS. YEAH, AND THEY GAVE HER A COOL WU TANG NAME. GHOST FACELIFT.

Jimmy: AWW. WELL, SHE'S A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE, GRANDMA.
GRANDMA IS A CHARACTER ALL ON ITS OWN. LAST WEEK WE FLEW IN, MY SISTERS AND I, BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR PRODUCTION COMPANY. AND WE SOLD OUR FIRST SHOW TO AOL, AND IT'S CALLED "MY HERO."
Jimmy: COOL.
AND WE WERE HAVING, LIKE, A A DINNER CELEBRATION. AND, YOU KNOW, THE SOUVENIRS WERE LIKE THESE SUNGLASSES. AND SHE WAS GOING BY EVERY CHAIR.
Jimmy: GRANDMA.
AND SHAKING EVERY BOX. AND WE WERE LIKE "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" AND SHE'S LIKE, "WELL, I NEED SUNGLASSES." GRANDMA, THAT MIGHT BE FOR THE GUEST THAT'S SITTING NEXT TO YOU. "WELL, HE'S NOT HERE." [ LAUGHTER ] SHE LITERALLY LEFT WITH LIKE -- I THINK IT WAS EIGHT OR NINE BOXES OF SUNGLASSES. I'M LIKE "IF YOU GET CAUGHT, I'M NOT DEALING WITH IT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ZOE SALDANA'S GRANDMA, SMUGGLING --
AND THEN SHE CALLS IN THE NEXT DAY. WELL, LISTEN, ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE IT TO THE DOCTORS SO I CAN GET MY PRESCRIPTION ON THEM? I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO DO IT. PRESCRIPTION.
Jimmy: THESE ILLEGAL GOODS. SMUGGLING THEM INTO LIKE A LENS CRAFTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S GREAT. AND YOU'RE CLOSE TO YOUR WHOLE FAMILY. YOU AND YOUR SISTER STARTED A A PRODUCTION COMPANY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO FUN. WHAT'S THE NAME OF YOUR COMPANY?
SINISTAR.
Jimmy: SINISTAR. AH, VERY COOL. AND YOU'RE DOING "ROSEMARY'S BABY" AS WELL. DID YOU PRODUCE THAT?
YES, WE ACTUALLY -- IT IS OUT FIRST PROJECT THAT WE PRODUCED, AND WHEN THEY APPROACHED ME TO DO THE PART, THEY ACTUALLY SAID "IF YOU GUYS WANT TO PRODUCE IT, YOU GUYS CAN JUMP ALONG." AND IT WAS GREAT. EVEN THOUGH WE WERE THE LAST PRODUCERS TO JUMP ON BOARD, THEY REALLY ALLOWED US TO INCORPORATE A LOT OF OUR IDEAS. SO WE FELT VERY RELEVANT.
Jimmy: THAT'S VERY COOL. AND YOU'RE CLOSE TO YOUR PARENTS AS WELL, RIGHT?
VERY CLOSE WITH MY PARENTS. I'M ALWAYS WITH THEM. WHICH IS WHY IF I CAN'T GET TO TOGETHER WITH THEM, THEY UNDERSTAND. BUT MY PARENTS ARE LIKE TEENAGERS. THEY GO OUT TO DINNER WITH YOU AND YOU WINE AND YOU DINE THEM. AND THEN YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN A TAXI AND THEY GO "WHERE ARE YOU GOING?" AND I'M GOING TO GO DANCING, I'M GOING TO GO HANG OUT WITH YOU SOME YOUNG PEOPLE. "AW, BUT WE WANT TO COME!" AND YOU'RE LIKE, UGH. NO, GO HOME! YOU'RE OLD PEOPLE.
Jimmy: YEAH, DO OLD PEOPLE STUFF. [ LAUGHTER ] MY PARENTS WOULD GET INVITES TO PARTIES AT HIGH SCHOOL THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE LIKE, "HEY ARE YOU GOING TO JARED'S?" AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT. "OH, YEAH, HE CALLED EARLIER AND INVITED US." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU INVITED MY MOM AND DAD TO YOUR PARTY AND NOT ME? YOU CAN'T GO TO THIS KID'S PARTY, YOU'RE ON OLD PERSON.
AND THEN WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THAT YOU END UP HANGING OUT WITH YOUR PARENTS MORE THAN WITH YOUR FRIENDS. BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS HAPPEN TO BE FUN. MY PARENTS ARE SUPER FUN.
Jimmy: MY PARENTS ARE SUPER DUPER FUN. LET'S TALK "ROSEMARY'S BABY." WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THIS, 'CAUSE NBC, THE ADS ARE EVERYWHERE. WE DID A BIT ON OUR SHOW, PROS AND CONS OF THE HAVING A DEVIL BABY. I'LL SEND IT TO YOU.

Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. RIGHT THERE. THAT'S IT, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S SCARY, YOU MOVE INTO AN APARTMENT AND YOU THINK YOUR HUSBAND AND HIS NEIGHBORS ARE SATANIC.
YES, AND THEY APPEAR TO BE THE MOST HOSPITABLE SURROGATE PARENTS ANYBODY CAN HAVE AS NEIGHBORS, AND THERE IS SOMETHING VERY SINISTER AND THE MORE AND MORE MY CHARACTER DIVES INTO THE LIVES OF THESE PEOPLE. THE DARKER IT BECOMES, AND THEN IT'S JUST TOO LATE FOR HER TO GET OUT.

YOU TRUST HIM AFTER SEEING HIM ONE TIME? EVEN THOUGH DR. STAPPERSTIEN, A A RENOWNED OBSTETRICIAN, WHO YOU HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE TIMES HAS GIVEN YOU A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS.
I JUST WANT TO GET A SECOND OPINION. JULIE THINKS IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
ENOUGH WITH WHAT JULIE THINKS. YOU DON'T TRUST HER. YOU TRUST ME.
