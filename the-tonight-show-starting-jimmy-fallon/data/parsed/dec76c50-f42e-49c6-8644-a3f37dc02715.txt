HE GOES, "OH, MY GOD! MOM, BATMAN! I CAN'T EVEN WATCH IT? MOM, CAN I WATCH IT WITH THE BABY?"

AND SO HE'S BEEN IN THE KITCHEN SINCE HE WAS IN THE BJORN AND HE STARTED WITH LIKE LITTLE WOODEN KNIVES AND I GRADUATED HIM TO BUTTER KNIVES AND HE JUST IS DYING TO GET HIS HANDS ON THE BUTCHER KNIVES.

Jimmy: OH! HE'S A GREAT ACTOR.
I MEAN, HE'S AMAZING. HE WAS ON "GAME OF THROWNS" "PATRIOT GAMES," "LORD OF THE RINGS." A GRAVITAS TO IT.
Jimmy: MMM.
AND YOU KNOW, THEY US CURRENT EVENTS. ALL DIFFERENT THINGS KIND OF WEAVE THIS INTRICATELY TOLD STORY OF THE BEHIND THE SCENES OF THESE AGENTS. AND SO, YOU DON'T REALLY SEE THEM WHEN YOU'RE ON POINT AND WHEN THINGS ARE GOING WELL. YOU SEE WHEN THEY MAKE A A MISTAKE AND HOW THEY CRUMBLE AFTER. SO IT HAS THAT HAS THAT "BOURNE" ELEMENT TO IT.
Jimmy: YEAH! YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S -- THAT'S THE THING. YOU DON YOU REALLY ARE. YOU GO, "WAIT."

Jimmy: STANDUP WITH ANDY WOODHULL WHEN WE GET BACK, EVERYBODY. COME ON BACK! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST IS A A VERY FUNNY COMEDIAN MAKING HIS NETWORK TV DEBUT WITH US TONIGHT. HE'LL BE PERFORMING AT THE BROUHAHA FESTIVAL IN CINCINNATI AUGUST 21st THROUGH 23rd. THIS IS A BIG MOMENT. I'M VERY EXCITED FOR THIS GUY. PLEASE GIVE A WARM "TONIGHT SHOW" WELCOME TO THE HILARIOUS ANDY WOODHULL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THAT'S GREAT. I JUST BECAME A FATHER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. MY KIDS ARE 10 AND 12. [ LAUGHTER ] IT GOES BY SO FAST, DOESN'T IT? SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE IT ALL HAPPENED TO ANOTHER GUY AND THAT I JUST MARRIED THEIR MOM WHEN THEY WERE 10 AND 12. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. I'M A STEPFATHER. I LOVE MY STEPDAUGHTERS. I GOT TWO OF THEM. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH IT SCARES ME. BECAUSE IT'S BEEN GUARANTIED TO ME FROM OTHER STEPPARENTS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A DAY WHEN I'M TRYING TO TEACH THEM SOMETHING AND THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT ME AND GO, "I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY. YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD." IT'S GOING TO BREAK MY HEART WHEN THAT HAPPENS. BUT IT DOES MAKE ME FEEL BETTER TO KNOW THERE COULD BE ANOTHER DAY WHEN I'M GOING TO BE IN A A PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE OR A A POLICE STATION -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND A STRANGER WILL BE YELLING AT ME, AND I'M GOING TO GET TO GO, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY. THOSE ARE NOT MY REAL DAUGHTERS." YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU SHOULD GET THEIR REAL DAD ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW. THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE THEY GOT THAT WEED IN THE FIRST PLACE. [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WOULD BE READY TO BE A HUSBAND, THE HEAD OF A HOUSEHOLD. I USED TO LIVE ALONE A YEAR AGO. I'M NOT SURE I WAS QUALIFIED TO BE THE HEAD OF THAT HOUSEHOLD. [ LAUGHTER ] MY APARTMENT GOT ROBBED LAST YEAR WHILE I WAS LIVING ALONE. I GOT SO SCARED I STARTED TO CRY, AND I CALLED THE POLICE. I SAID, "YOU NEED TO GET OVER HERE. THERE'S BEEN CRIME. YOU HAVE SOME CRIME FIGHTING TO DO." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, SIX HOURS LATER, ONE POLICE OFFICER SHOWED UP AND SHE WAS WEARING SHAPE-UPS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT YOU WEAR TO FIGHT CRIME IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD? CURVED BOTTOM WORKOUT SHOES? I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE IF YOU HAD A MASK AND A CAPE ON RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] IS IT INTIMIDATING TO THE CRIMINALS WHEN YOU'RE CHASING THEM DOWN, AND THEY'RE LOOKING BACK OVER THEIR SHOULDER LIKE, "HOW COULD I EVER HOPE TO GET AWAY WHEN HER LEGS AND ASS ARE GETTING STRONGER WITH EVERY STEP SHE TAKES?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS READY. AND THEN, SOMETHING HAPPENED, AND I KNEW I WAS READY. AND I OFFER AS ADVICE TO ANY SINGLE MOMS OUT THERE. YOU WANT TO SEE IF YOUR BOYFRIEND IS READY TO MARRY YOU? DO WHAT MY WIFE DID. HAVE YOUR KIDS GIVE YOUR BOYFRIEND LICE. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW IT'S REAL. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE CALLED ME LAST FALL, AND SHE SAID, "YOU MIGHT HAVE LICE." I WISH SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLING TO TELL ME THAT I HAD A A STD. AT LEAST THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ADULTS GET. AND I CAN GO TO THE DOCTOR AND GET SOME MEDICINE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT LICE. DO I HAVE TO FIND AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TO GET TESTED AT? [ LAUGHTER ] DO I HAVE TO BUST INTO A FRONT OFFICE? SOMEBODY GET ME A SCHOOL NURSE, STAT. YOU KNOW WHAT? HAVE HER CHECK ME FOR SCOLIOSIS WHILE SHE'S AT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S BEEN A WHILE. BEEN A WHILE. [ APPLAUSE ] DOES THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TAKE OBAMACARE? [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S WHAT I REALLY HAD TO DO. I HAD TO CALL MY FRIENDS AND SAY, "HEY, PAL, WILL YOU COME OVER FOR A MINUTE?" HE GOES, "WHAT FOR?" AND I SAID, WELL, I WAS HOPING THAT YOU WOULD COMB MY HAIR FOR A WHILE. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS HOPING THAT YOU WOULD REALLY CAREFULLY COMB MY HAIR, MAYBE PICK THROUGH IT WITH A A NUMBER 2 PENCIL IF YOU HAVE ONE ON YOU. AND THEN, I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO SHAMPOO ME. LATHER ME UP, BUDDY. IT SAYS ON THE BOTTLE OF THE LICE SHAMPOO THAT YOU SHOULDN'T APPLY IT TO YOURSELF. HOW MANY OF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A FRIEND THAT WOULD BE A GOOD ENOUGH FRIEND TO COME OVER AND SHAMPOO THE PARASITES OUT OF YOUR HAIR? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE ZERO FRIENDS THAT ARE THAT GOOD OF FRIEND. ALL MY FRIENDS ARE LIKE, "HEY, MAN, COULDN'T I JUST LOOK AT YOUR JUNK, LET YOU KNOW IF IT LOOKS WEIRD OR SOMETHING?" [ LAUGHTER ] SO WE HAD LICE TOGETHER, AND NOW WE COULDN'T BE MORE IN LOVE. WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE FIGHT IN ALMOST TEN MONTHS OF MARRIAGE. HERE'S WHAT IT WAS. I WAS UNPACKING MY BOXES AFTER WE MOVED IN TOGETHER. MY WIFE SAW ME AND SHE GOES, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THOSE DISHES? YOU BOUGHT THOSE WHEN YOU WERE LIVING WITH ANOTHER WOMAN, AND I DON'T WANT ANOTHER WOMAN'S DISHES IN MY HOME." AND I GET WHERE SHE'S COMING FROM. MAYBE YOU AGREE WITH HER POINT OF VIEW AS WELL. BUT BEFORE YOU DECIDE THAT SHE'S RIGHT AND I'M WRONG, I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU THAT MY WIFE HAS TWO DAUGHTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T THINK I'M BEING UNREASONABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY THAT YOU SHOW UP WITH THE PICNIC WITH NO BASKET OF YOUR OWN. THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY. IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO SPECIFICS, I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT MY DISHES DON'T KIND OF LOOK LIKE MY EX-GIRLFRIEND. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY DISHES DON'T GO OVER TO MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE EVERY OTHER WEEKEND, AND THEN COME HOME AND TELL US HOW MUCH MORE FUN IT IS IN HER CABINET. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY TO DO IT, BUDDY. ANDY WOODHULL RIGHT HERE! ANDY WOODHULL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
