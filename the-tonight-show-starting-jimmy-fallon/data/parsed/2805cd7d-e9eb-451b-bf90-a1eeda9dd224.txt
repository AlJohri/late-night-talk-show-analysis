Jimmy: HEY! OH! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! OH, IT'S GOING TO BE A FUN ONE TONIGHT. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. AND I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE OUR ENTIRE AUDIENCE IS MADE UP OF PEOPLE WHO BROKE OUT OF A A PRISON IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS A CRAZY STORY. I'M SURE MOST OF YOU KNOW. TWO PRISONERS RECENTLY ESCAPED FROM A MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON IN UPSTATE NEW YORK AND POLICE HAVE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR THEM. THEY STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THEM. SO, TODAY OFFICIALS RELEASED SKETCHES OF WHAT THE TWO MEN MIGHT LOOK LIKE AFTER TEN DAYS OF BEING ON THE RUN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS REAL. TAKE A LOOK. THERE IT IS. THEY MIGHT LOOK LIKE THAT AFTER LIVING IN THE WOODS, OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THINKING.
Steve: SHAVED.
Jimmy: WELL GROOMED. YEAH, THEY BROUGHT A GROOMER WITH THEM. WHATEVER THEY BROUGHT.
Steve: GOT A FLOWBEE.
Jimmy: BUT THEY'RE SAYING WHO KNOWS WHAT LENGTHS THE TWO ARE GOING TO GO TO IN ORDER TO DISGUISE THEMSELVES. SOME EVEN SPECULATE PLASTIC SURGERY COULD BE INVOLVED. SO TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROJECTION OF WHAT THEY MIGHT LOOK LIKE AFTER A YEAR ON THE RUN. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING WRONG THERE. THEY DEFINITELY HAD SOME WORK DONE. WHAT'S EVEN CRAZIER IS THE SKETCH THAT SHOWS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AFTER TWO YEARS ON THE RUN. LOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THAT'S JUST INSANE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK I KNOW WHAT STREET THEY'RE HIDING ON.
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO GET THERE.
Steve: OH, THAT'S THE WORST. THAT'S THE WORST.
Jimmy: YESTERDAY, ON CNN, ONE OF THEIR ANALYSTS WAS TALKING ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO HELPED THESE PRISONERS ESCAPE. HE TRIED TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT THE WOMAN'S APPEARANCE. AT LEAST I THINK IT WAS A JOKE. CHECK THIS OUT.
I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE WAY SHE IS DRESSED. SHE HAS THAT BLACK VEST -- IS THAT A BULLETPROOF VEST? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. I'M JUST GUESSING.
IT MIGHT BE -- IT MIGHT BE A VEST SHE WEARS FOR ONE OF THOSE LIFE-SAVING VESTS, TOO. IN CASE SOMEBODY THROWS HER IN THE WATER AND SHE'S DROWNING. BUT, YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS A LIFE JACKET.
WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT?
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: SOMEONE'S DROWNING, ALL RIGHT. IT'S NOT HER. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. SOMEONE NEEDS TO THROW HIM A A JOKE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHAT? LET'S GET TO SOME HAPPIER NEWS. I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS, WHO BEAT THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ TO WIN THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP. THIS IS A LITTLE AWKWARD, IF YOU WATCHED IT LAST NIGHT. MARK JACKSON, WHO WAS FIRED AS THE WARRIORS COACH LAST SEASON, IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BROADCASTERS WHO CALLED THEIR BIG WIN FOR ABC. WHICH IS BASICALLY THE SPORTS EQUIVALENT OF THE BRIDE'S EX GIVING A WEDDING TOAST. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE'S LIKE, "I'M SO HAPPY FOR SHEILA AND CHAD. [ LAUGHTER ] CHAD'S SUCH A GREAT GUY, ISN'T HE? PROBABLY WRITES POEMS FOR HER. DON'T YOU, CHAD?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TELL THEM TO SHUT THE MIC OFF. AND AFTER LOSING TO THE WARRIORS, LeBRON JAMES TALKED ABOUT HIS TEAM, SAYING, QUOTE, "WE RAN OUT OF TALENT." AND CAVALIERS ARE LIKE, "OH, NOW IT IS 'WE'? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OH, THAT'S INTERESTING. NO, NO, PLEASE, TAKE ALL THE CREDIT FOR THIS ONE. TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS. NOW IT'S 'WE,' RIGHT? INTERESTING." OF COURSE, THE OTHER BIG STORY IS THAT DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCED -- [ CHEERS ] THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AND DURING HIS SPEECH HE TOLD THE CROWD THAT IF ELECTED HE WOULD BE THE GREATEST JOBS PRESIDENT THAT GOD EVER CREATED. THEN GOD WAS LIKE, "HEY, DON'T DRAG ME INTO THIS PUBLICITY STUNT. THAT'S YOUR THING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE" COMES ON. YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU DO. AND DID YOU SEE -- AFTER THE INTERVIEW, AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT, HE DID AN INTERVIEW AND HE TOLD ABC NEWS THAT IF HE HAD OPRAH AS HIS RUNNING MATE, HE COULD EASILY WIN.

LOOK UNDER YOUR SEAT, TAX BREAKS! [ APPLAUSE ] AND THIS IS NOT GOOD, HERE. I READ THAT THE SPANISH VERSION OF HILLARY CLINTON'S WEBSITE APPARENTLY CONTAINS NUMEROUS MISTAKES AND GRAMMATICAL ERRORS. WHEN SHE HEARD ABOUT THIS, HILLARY WAS LIKE, "AYE, DORITOS MIO." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, PEOPLE HAVE NOTICED THAT HILLARY'S SPANISH WEBSITE CONTAINS MANY MISTAKES AND GRAMMATICAL ERRORS. WELL, I THOUGHT I COULD CLEAR THE AIR AND EXPLAIN THE SITUATION TO OUR AUDIENCE IN SPANISH. [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

THOSE BELIEFS, QUOTE, "HAVE TO BE CHANGED." THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. [ BOOS ] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, I WANT TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT THIS, BUT HE WAS JUST HERE LAST NIGHT. I CAN'T BE TOO HARD ON BUSH.
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: THIS FILM "A LITTLE CHAOS," HERE. THIS, WHICH YOU'VE DIRECTED AS WELL, YES?
YES.
Jimmy: AND STAR IN. ARE YOU HARD TO DIRECT AS A A DIRECTOR IF YOU'RE THE ACTOR? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I ASK THE DEEP QUESTIONS HERE, YEAH.
HAVE I REMEMBERED MY LINES IS A GOOD START.
Jimmy: YEAH, THERE'S A LOT. NO, I'M NOT IN IT THAT MUCH.
Jimmy: WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO DO THIS TYPE OF FILM? IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FILM, AND SET IN A DIFFERENT PERIOD OF TIME.
IT'S A VERY HARD FILM TO TALK ABOUT ON A SHOW LIKE THIS. BECAUSE YOU THINK, I'M GOING TO START TALKING AND PEOPLE ARE --
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'LL TRY AND SAY IT QUICKLY. IT'S SET IN THE COURT OF LOUIE XIV, 17th CENTURY FRANCE, KATE WINSLET, ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT IN THE FILM.
Jimmy: I MEAN, KATE WINSLET COULD DO ANYTHING. WE LOVE KATE WINSLET. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU COULD DO ANYTHING. WE LOVE YOU.
IT'S A FANTASY IN ONE SENSE, BECAUSE SHE PLAYS A LANDSCAPE GARDENER WHO GETS HIRED BY ANDRE LINOTRE WHO REALLY LIVED TO DESIGN ONE OF THE FOUNTAINS AT THE GARDEN OF VERSAILLES. THAT'S THE BACKGROUND. REALLY IT'S A LOVE STORY BETWEEN HER. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY ME, I PLAYED LOUIS XIV.
Jimmy: THAT IS NOT TRUE.
IT IS TRUE.
Jimmy: NO IT IS NOT TRUE. YOU DIRECTED THE FILM AND YOU CAST YOURSELF AS THE KING OF FRANCE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. COME ON! THAT IS WHAT I WOULD DO IF I DIRECTED IT. I AM THE KING, BABY! DEFINITELY. I GOT WHO'S IN IT. YEAH, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY AUDITIONS, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. OF COURSE THEY HAVE TO PAY YOU, YOU'RE THE KING.
NONE OF YOU WERE WEARING THAT COSTUME, AND WANTED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. BUT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL FILM. ALSO STANLEY TUCCI IS IN IT AS WELL. IT IS CALLED "A LITTLE CHAOS." WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S ALAN RICKMAN WITH KATE WINSLET IN "A LITTLE CHAOS." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
TIME HAS COME, MADAME, FOR US BOTH TO FACE DOWN OUR PAST AND LIVE IN THE PRESENT. WRITE A LETTER FROM ONE GARDENER TO ANOTHER, SHALL WE SAY IN RETURN FOR SEEDS SEWN THAT WILL BRING YOU TO THE COURT WHERE MY EYE WILL ALWAYS BE ON YOU. I SHALL NOT FORGET OUR DAY IN THE GARDEN, MADAME. [ APPLAUSE ]
