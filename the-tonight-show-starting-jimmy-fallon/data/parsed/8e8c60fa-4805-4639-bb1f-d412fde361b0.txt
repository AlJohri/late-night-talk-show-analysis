Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. "22 JUMP STREET" OPENS FRIDAY THE 13th. OUR THANKS TO JONAH6HILL. CHICAGO MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL JOINS US AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST HAS BEEN IN POLITICS FOR OVER 25 YEARS. HE SERVED ON THE STAFFS OF TWO PRESIDENTS, MOST RECENTLY AS THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA. AND, HE CURRENTLY -- HE'S THE MAYOR OF CHICAGO. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHEN WE LAUNCHED "THE TONIGHT SHOW," I DID INTERVIEWS IN CITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND "THE CHICAGO SUN TIMES" ASKED IF I WOULD EVER HAVE THE MAYOR, RAHM EMANUEL, ON THE SHOW. AND, I HAD KNOWN RAHM THROUGH, YOU KNOW, READING ABOUT HIM IN THE PAPERS. I SAID I'M AFRAID OF -- [ LAUGHTER ] I'M AFRAID OF RAHM EMANUEL. IF RAHM EMANUEL WANTS TO HOST THE SHOW, HE CAN COME HOST. I WAS LIKE -- I DIDN'T -- BUT ANYWAYS, MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL RESPONDED BY SAYING, "JIMMY FALLON, LOOK, IF I'M GOING TO COME ON YOUR SHOW, YOU NEED TO TOUGHEN UP." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE SAID, "COME DO THE POLAR PLUNGE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JUMP INTO LAKE MICHIGAN IN THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY -- OR THE END OF FEBRUARY. IT WAS -- YEAH. SO ANYWAYS, I DID IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO, HERE NOW TO UPHOLD HIS END OF THE BARGAIN IS THE MAYOR OF CHICAGO, RAHM EMANUEL! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. MAYOR, WELCOME TO OUR SHOW. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON AFTER I TOUGHENED UP.
YES. YOU CAUGHT THE BAR. YOU MADE THE BAR. YOU DID IT.
Jimmy: I DID IT. I WAS PRETTY TOUGH.
VERY TOUGH.
Jimmy: THAT THERE'S AN INSANE THING. WHAT I DID.
OH, THAT'S NOT A RATIONAL ACT.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S REALLY NOT.
NO, IT'S NOT A RATIONAL ACT.
Jimmy: I MEAN, YOU -- WE JUMPED IN THAT WATER. BUT HERE'S -- HERE'S YOU.
YES, BUT IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.
Jimmy: WELL, THIS IS FOR -- YOU ASKED THESE KIDS IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, RIGHT?
YEAH, THERE WAS -- I CHALLENGED THE KIDS IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. I SAID, "YOU READ TWO MILLION BOOKS." I SAID, "I'LL JUMP. I'LL DO THE POLAR PLUNGE," WHICH RAISES MONEY FOR THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS. THEY RAISED -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY RAISED 2.1. NOW, THAT'S CHICAGO TRADITION, SO I DEFINITELY AM GOING FOR A A RECOUNT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE --
Jimmy: NO, NO. IT'S TOO LATE. YOU ALL READY WENT IN. YOU ALL READY DID IT.
IT WAS KIND OF A VOTE COUNT. IT'S CHICAGO, SO WE KNOW SOMEBODY WAS LIKE DEALING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE DECK.
Jimmy: NO, IT WAS -- IT WAS COLD THAT DAY, THOUGH. IT WAS REALLY, REALLY COLD.
YEAH. YOUR INSIGHTS ARE UNBELIEVABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS GOING TO SAY -- IT WAS -- WELL, IT'S 32 DEGREES IN THE WATER. AND, IT'S SEVEN DEGREES UP ABOVE. AND, SO HERE'S THE -- BUT THERE'S, LIKE, A BRIEF SECOND. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE READY FOR ALL COLD -- AND IT'S 20 -- IT'S 32 IN THE WATER. IT'S SEVEN OUT -- UP IN THE AIR. AND YOU, LIKE, THINK, FOR 32 -- LIKE, THERE'S A BRIEF MOMENT THE WATER'S WARMER THAN THE AIR. AND YOU THINK, LIKE, THREE KIDS JUST SWAM RIGHT BY. IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. IT'S NOT WHAT I'M FEELING AT ALL. I HAD A DIFFERENT -- TOTALLY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE.
NO, BUT THEN WHEN YOU DIVE AND YOU GET OUT -- YOU GOT TO GO, MAN.
Jimmy: OH, YOU FEEL -- NO, YOU WENT IN, YOU CAME OUT. I WENT IN RIGHT AFTER YOU. AND, I REMEMBER, I WENT -- BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO LET DOWN CHICAGO. SO I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY IN. SO I WENT AND I --
WELL, THOSE ARE THE RULES.
Jimmy: I DID THE PLUNGE -- I DID THE FULL ON -- I WENT UNDER THE WATER, AND I SAW BUBBLES COME OUT OF MY MOUTH, AND THEN I FROZE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL ANYTHING. I GO, "OH, I MIGHT BE -- I MIGHT BE DEAD." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW?
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US. I KIND OF, LIKE -- I KICKED IN, MAN. SOON AS I WENT IN, I SAID, "I'M IN, I'M OUT. I DID MY JOB."
Jimmy: YEAH. NO, BUT I WENT IN, I CAME OUT. I HEARD BAGPIPES. I LOOKED AROUND FOR BAGPIPERS. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IRISH, THAT'S WHAT YOU HEAR WHEN YOU DIE. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU HEAR. YOU HEAR BAGPIPES.
SEE, YOU KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS? I HEARD "HAVA NAGILA." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A A CONTEST -- IN CHICAGO, AS THE FIRST JEWISH MAYOR, WE TAUGHT THE SHANNON ROVERS "HAVA NAGILA."
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S VERY, VERY -- YEAH, VERY SMART. BUT, THIS IS YOU COMING OUT OF THE WATER. LOOK, YOU'RE TOUGH. YOU WORK OUT. LOOK AT THIS. YOU'RE A FIT GUY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S ME COMING OUT OF THE WATER, RIGHT HERE. WHAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I LIKE THAT LOOK.
Jimmy: UH, YEAH.
LET'S PUT THAT SIDE-BY-SIDE. ONCE AGAIN, I DON'T THINK WE GET THE FULL IMPACT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU GOT --
THERE IT IS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT WAS, YEAH.
WHO WOULD YOU WANT TO BE MAYOR OF YOUR CITY? [ LAUGHTER ] WHO WOULD WANT -- THEY WOULD WANT -- I CAN BE MAYOR.
WAIT A SECOND. WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE MAYOR, AND WHO DO YOU WANT TO DO A A TALK SHOW? BUT WHAT REALLY MADE ME HAPPY IS THAT YOU GUYS DECLARED CHICAGO, FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, THE OFFICIAL "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON" MONTH IN CHICAGO.
THAT'S RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S OUR CHALLENGE. BECAUSE IT'S OFFICIAL, HERE'S OUR CHALLENGE.
Jimmy: OH NO.
THIS YEAR THE KIDS OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO --
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
I CHALLENGED THEM TO 2.4 MILLION BOOKS TO BE READ. AND, IF THEY DO IT THIS SUMMER, WE WANT YOU TO BRING "THE TONIGHT SHOW" BACK TO CHICAGO. IT HASN'T BEEN SINCE 1998. IF THEY READ IT, WILL YOU DO IT? FOR THE KIDS OF CHICAGO. [ LAUGHTER ] [ DRUM ROLL ]
Jimmy: IF THEY READ 11 MILLION BOOKS?
NO, NO, NO. 2.4. AND WE'LL HIRE AN ACCOUNTING FIRM TO DO IT. A LOCAL THING, SCHWARTZ AND SCHWARTZ. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'LL DO THE ACCOUNTING.
Jimmy: SCHWARTZ AND SCHWARTZ. IT'S -- LET'S TALK.
NO, 2.5 MILLION BOOKS. YOU CAN BRING THE SHOW ANY TIME BACK TO CHICAGO. IT HASN'T BEEN THERE SINCE 1998.
Jimmy: I'D LOVE TO GO TO CHICAGO.
