I ALSO SAW THAT POPE FRANCIS ALSO HELD HIS FIRST EVER PRAYER HERE IN NEW YORK CITY EARLIER THIS EVENING. YEP, I GUESS IT WAS HALFWAY THROUGH HIS FIRST NEW YORK CITY CAB RIDE. LIKE, "HOLY MARY, MOTHER OF -- [ APPLAUSE ] I'LL GET OUT HERE. I'LL GET OUT HERE." [ LAUGHTER ] POPE'S BEEN VERY BUSY THIS MORNING. HE MADE AN APPEARANCE ALONGSIDE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE NOTICED JOHN BOEHNER WAS ONCE AGAIN CRYING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND TO NO ONE'S SURPRISE, JOE BIDEN EXPRESSED HIS EMOTIONS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. WATCH. [ APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: YOU JUST NAILED IT. THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SING. I'VE KNOWN -- I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR YEARS NOW.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WE'VE DONE SINGING BITS TOGETHER.
WELL, LAST TIME I LIP-SYNCHED.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. YOU DIDN'T EVEN SING AT ALL.
I DIDN'T GET TO SING.
Jimmy: NO ONE SAW THAT, BY THE WAY.
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY --
Jimmy: 50 MILLION HITS ON YOUTUBE THAT THING.
OH, I KNOW, JIMMY. I CHECK IT EVERY DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, BUT ACTUALLY MORE -- MORE PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AND SAY, "OH, I LOVE THE LIP-SYNCH" MORE THAN, LIKE, "INCEPTION" OR "DARK KNIGHT RISES" OR "500 DAYS OF SUMMER." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S REALLY FUNNY. MORE PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AND SAY IT'S THE SUPER BASS MAN.
Jimmy: NICKI MINAJ, UNBELIEVABLE. BUT NOW YOU FINALLY GET TO SING. YOU USED TO BE IN A BAND, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I WAS IN A A HIGH SCHOOL BAND WHEN I WAS 16 AND 17.
Jimmy: I WANT TO KNOW DETAILS. I WANT TO KNOW EVERY --
IT'S REALLY EMBARRASSING.
Jimmy: WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE BAND?
IT WAS NOT A GOOD BAND NAME.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S THE BEST. COME ON! WHAT IS IT? WHAT WAS IT? WAS IT ONE WORD?
IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE FUNNY OR ANYTHING. NO, IT WASN'T ONE WORD. IT WAS CALLED FOAD ON THE MARCH. SILENCE OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M TRYING TO THINK. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? I'M TRYING TO THINK IF I CAN GUESS --
IT WAS A KID AT OUR SCHOOL. HE WAS THIS KID NAMED FOAD. WE WEREN'T EVEN THAT CLOSE WITH HIM. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NAMED OUR BAND AFTER HIM.
Jimmy: DID HE KNOW THAT?
NO, I DON'T -- IT'S NOT LIKE OUR BAND WAS POPULAR OR ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] FOAD DIDN'T KNOW THAT WE --
Jimmy: FOAD ON THE MARCH?
YEAH, AND IT'S SPELLED F-O-A-D. SO, EVERYONE IF THEY SAW IT WRITTEN WOULD SAY FODE ON THE MARCH. WE'RE LIKE IT'S NOT FODE, IT'S FOAD. AND THEY'D BE LIKE, "WHY FOAD?" AND WE'RE LIKE, THERE'S NO REASON MAN!
Jimmy: NO ONE UNDERSTANDS US! SHUT THE DOOR, MOM! [ LAUGHTER ]
YES, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: WE'RE REHEARSING! FOAD ON THE MARCH. WHAT KIND OF MUSIC WAS FOAD ON THE MARCH?
IT WAS, YOU KNOW, IT WAS FOUR 16-YEAR-OLD BOYS TURNING THEIR GUITARS UP VERY LOUDLY AND HURTING THEIR EARS AND HAVING A GREAT TIME DOING IT.
Jimmy: YEAH. DID YOU HAVE ANY ORIGINAL SONGS? DID YOU DO COVER SONGS?
WE DID BOTH. WE HAD A CATALOG OF ORIGINALS.
Jimmy: DID YOU EVER PLAY ANY GIGS?
WE, YOU KNOW, WE PLAYED THE COBALT CAFE OUT IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU ACTUALLY PLAYED A A REAL GIG.
FOR, YOU KNOW, LIKE OUR FRIENDS. I MEAN, ACTUALLY THOSE ARE THE KIND OF BEST KINDS OF GIGS, THOUGH, 'CAUSE YOU'RE JUST DOING IT FOR FUN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND IT WASN'T LIKE -- I LOVED IT. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.
Jimmy: WHAT'S ONE OF THE ORIGINAL SONG TITLES FROM FOAD ON THE -- FROM FOAD ON THE MARCH? WHAT WOULD I EXPECT IF I GOT FRONT-ROW SEATS AT THE COBALT CAFE? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GIVE ME A TASTE.
THERE'S NO SEATS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: STANDING ROOM ONLY?
I WROTE A SONG CALLED "FIDO'S QUEST FOR THE MEANING OF LIFE." [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS ABOUT A DOG WHO DIED OF FLEAS SUCKING HIS BLOOD TO DEATH. IT WAS THE '90s, MAN. WE WERE LIKE INTO NIRVANA AND STUFF.
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY YOU BECAME AN ACTOR. [ LAUGHTER ] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I SAW THIS MOVIE, I GO, "OH, THERE'S NO ONE MORE PERFECT TO PLAY THIS MAN THAN YOU."
OH, THANKS.
Jimmy: YOU'RE FANTASTIC IN THE MOVIE, "THE WALK." THIS REALLY HAPPENED.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GUY -- WHAT'S HIS NAME?
PHILIPPE PETIT. OH, WI. [ LAUGHTER ] [ SPEAKING IN FRENCH ]
Jimmy: NOW WE'RE DOING DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WHAT?
Jimmy: BAGUETTE IS HUGE. FRANCE IS FANTASTIC.
ACTUALLY THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO HAVE A GOOD FRENCH ACCENT IS TO DUCK FACE YOUR LIPS LIKE DONALD TRUMP.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
THAT'S THE KEY, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU'RE FANTASTIC. NOT ONLY DO YOU SPEAK FRENCH IN THE MOVIE, WHICH I KNEW THAT YOU SPOKE FRENCH, THEN YOU HAVE TO SPEAK IN ENGLISH WITH A A FRENCH ACCENT.
YEP. [ FRENCH ACCENT ]
Jimmy: WHICH IS VERY TRICKY. TALKING LIKE ON THE WIRE. I COULD NEVER HAVE MADE IT.
SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT DOES NOT, BUT MAN, YOU'RE SO BELIEVABLE AND FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU, MAN. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH. THIS GUY IS JUST AN ARTIST. HE'S A WIRE WALKER. IS THAT WHAT YOU WOULD CALL HIM?
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY IT. YOU KNOW, HE'S HALF A BRILLIANT ARTIST AND HALF COMPLETELY OUT OF HIS MIND.
Jimmy: YEAH. HOW WOULD YOU COME UP WITH THIS IDEA? YOU GO, "OH, I WANNA WALK ON A A WIRE ACROSS THE TWIN TOWERS."
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GET PERMISSION.
BUT THAT'S THE THING. IS WE ALL HAVE THESE THINGS IN OUR LIFE THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE. WE KNOW WE CAN'T DO THEM, BUT ISN'T IT GREAT WHEN YOU REALLY TRY TO DO THEM, ANYWAY? AND THAT'S WHY I FIND HIM INSPIRING. 'CAUSE HE'S NOT A SUPERHERO. HE'S NOT, LIKE, YOU KNOW, MAGICAL IN ANY WAY. HE WAS A REAL PERSON, AND HE HAD THIS DREAM, AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT HE DID IT. AND I LOVE MAKING A MOVIE OUT OF THAT. THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.
Jimmy: BUT I MEAN -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I AGREE WITH YOU. YOU'RE RIGHT. WHY NOT? THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM, GO FOR IT. BUT I MEAN, HE HAD HIS BUDDY ON THE OTHER TOWER, AND HE'S SHOOTING A BOW AND ARROW.
A BOW AND ARROW.
Jimmy: WITH A FISHING WIRE. AND THEN ONCE THEY CATCH THAT, WHICH THEY BARELY CAUGHT IT.
I LIKE HOW YOU'RE STARTING TO TALK IN A FRENCH ACCENT. [ FRENCH ACCENT ]
Jimmy: I KNOW. TO WALK THE WALK, I HAVE TO TALK THE TALK, YOU KNOW? YOU WALK THE WALK, YOU HAVE TO TALK THE TALK. AND HE'S PULLING THIS THING OVER, AND THEN NOW I'M GONNA TALK IN LIKE A BROOKLYN ACCENT. [ BROOKLYN ACCENT ]
YOU'RE PULLING THAT THING OVER THERE.
Jimmy: THE FREAKING WIRE OVER HERE. PULLIN' THE THING. [ LAUGHTER ] FORGET ABOUT IT! YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? THEN IT'S JUST, HONESTLY, I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T FALL BECAUSE I KNOW THE HISTORY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT STILL, I'M NERVOUS.
WELL, THAT'S ROBERT ZEMECKIS. SO, THE FILM MAKER THAT MADE THIS MOVIE, HE'S THE GUY WHO MADE "BACK TO THE FUTURE," "FORREST GUMP," "ROGER RABBIT," "CASTAWAY," "FLIGHT." IT'S SUCH AN HONOR -- SUCH AN HONOR TO WORK FOR HIM.
Jimmy: AND IMAX 3-D. HAVE YOU SEEN IT IN IMAX 3-D?
I SAW IT IN IMAX. I SAW IT IN 3-D, BUT NOT IN IMAX 3-D.
Jimmy: I SAW IT IN IMAX 3-D AND I WAS LIKE -- 'CAUSE YOU'RE SEEING THE GROUND AND THE WIRE, LIKE, WOBBLING. AND YOU'RE MOVING YOUR FEET OVER IT. I'M SO SCARED. IT'S -- THE TECHNOLOGY IS GREAT RIGHT NOW.
THE THING IS A LOT OF 3-D MOVIES TO BE HONEST, I FEEL LIKE THEY KIND OF TACK THE 3-D ON AT THE END, AND IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE 3-D. BUT WHEN MR. ZEMECKIS CAME UP WITH THIS MOVIE THE WHOLE IDEA FROM THE BEGINNING IS WHAT'S THE PERFECT STORY THAT NECESSITATES 3-D? AND THIS IS WHAT HE CAME UP WITH AND COMPOSED EVERY SHOT WITH 3-D IN MIND. I WATCHED HIM DO IT. AND TO BE HONEST, I DON'T ALWAYS PREFER 3-D MOVIES, BUT THIS ONE I THINK IS REALLY GOOD IN 3-D.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND I'M ASSUMING BECAUSE I KNOW YOU, YOU PROBABLY WENT IN AND LEARNED TO WALK ON A WIRE.
I DID LEARN HOW TO WALK ON A A WIRE. PHILIPPE TAUGHT ME HOW TO DO IT. HE INSISTED THAT HE BE THE ONE TO TEACH ME. HE'S LIKE -- [ FRENCH ACCENT ] NO ONE -- NO ONE ELSE UNDERSTANDS THE ART, THE POETRY OF HOW I WALK ON THE WIRE, I WILL BE THE ONE TO SHOW YOU, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: SEE THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HE KNOWS HOW TO DO IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE ACTS LIKE IT'S NOTHING. THAT'S HOW GOOD HE IS. BUT HE TAUGHT YOU, HIMSELF. THAT'S SO RAD.
TAUGHT ME HOW TO DO IT.
Jimmy: AND HE ENDED UP NEVER LEAVING NEW YORK AFTER THAT.
HE'S A NEW YORKER. HE LOVES NEW YORK CITY. THIS MOVIE IS A LOVE LETTER TO NEW YORK CITY.
Jimmy: IT REALLY IS. AND WHAT A GREAT CITY. GOSH, DON'T YOU LOVE THIS CITY? ISN'T IT GREAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

I DID A SPEECH. WE DIDN'T -- IT'S SO MAD -- IT'S SO STRESSFUL, BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE YOU HAVE LONGER THAN YOU HAVE. AND YOU'RE LIKE, "I'D LIKE TO THANK," AND THEY START PLAYING THE MUSIC, "EVERYONE I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE!"
Jimmy: AND RUN AWAY, YEAH. BUT YOU WERE PROBABLY NERVOUS, BECAUSE YOU HAD A BIGGER THING HAPPENING.
YEAH, I GOT ENGAGED THE NIGHT OF THE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. LET'S GET INTO IT.
ENGAGEMENT!
Jimmy: ENGAGEMENT! NO, TELL ME ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT.
THE ENGAGEMENT. WELL, IT WAS -- IT MADE ME NOT NERVOUS ABOUT THE EMMYS. BUT MY GIRLFRIEND, LYDIA HEARST AND I, HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR ABOUT A YEAR. AND I'VE BEEN PLANNING TO ASK HER TO COMMIT HERSELF TO ME LEGALLY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S SUCH A A ROMANTIC WAY --
I HAVE THESE DOCUMENTS. I SEE EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER HERE.
Jimmy: WE ARE GOING TO GET A A TAX BREAK. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: I NEED AN EMERGENCY CONTACT.
I NEED SOMEONE TO PICK ME UP AFTER SCHOOL.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. YEAH, PERFECT.
SO, YEAH, I WAS GOING TO DO IT -- YOU GUYS HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY, ACTUALLY, SEPTEMBER 19th.

I'M GOING TO DO MY SHOW IN AUSTIN, I'M GONNA FLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY, SHOW UP AT DISNEYLAND, AND BE LIKE -- [ MICKEY MOUSE VOICE ] "HUH-HUH, SURPRISE, LET'S GET MARRIED!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IN THE MICKEY MOUSE, YEAH, YEAH. SO GLAD YOU DIDN'T DO THAT. YOU COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN THE COSTUME IN TIME.
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET IN THE COSTUME.
Jimmy: WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR VOICE? I DON'T KNOW. [ MICKEY MOUSE VOICE ]
HEY, WILL YOU MAKE ME THE HAPPIEST -- GET AWAY FROM ME YOU FRIGGIN' CREEP! [ GOOFY VOICE ] I JUST WANT TO LOVE YOU FOREVER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T PICK A A DIFFERENT CHARACTER. JUST DON'T DO IT.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Jimmy: DONALD DUCK IS PANTLESS. YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
SO, WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT A A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE, THE PREVIOUS WEEKEND, SHE SAID, "OH, IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT AT DISNEYLAND NOW." AND SO I FIGURED, "OH MY GOD, CREATIVE ARTS EMMYS, WE'RE GOING TO BE DRESSED UP ANYWAY. I'M GOING TO TELL HER THERE'S AN AFTER PARTY AT THE CHATEAU MARMONT --
Jimmy: OOH!
AND TRICK HER! 'CAUSE THERE'S AN ACCEPTABLE AMOUNT OF DECEPTION WHEN YOU'RE ASKING SOMEONE TO MARRY YOU. IT'S THE ONLY TIME YOU CAN LIE TO YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER AND THEN IT'S ADORABLE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE ONLY TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE --
SO, I TOLD HER THERE WAS A A WORK PARTY THAT WE HAD TO GO TO. AND SHE SAID OKAY. AND I WAS LAUGHING INSIDE THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE DRIVING OVER THERE, 'CAUSE SHE WAS TEXTING SOMEONE. I'M LIKE, "YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN."
Jimmy: I GOT -- I WAS SO NERVOUS WHEN I ASKED MY WIFE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
Jimmy: WELL, I KEPT SAYING TO MYSELF, "DON'T CRY FIRST, LET HER CRY." [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I KNEW -- I GET VERY EMOTIONAL. I'M LIKE BOEHNER. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M VERY EMOTIONAL. SO I WENT DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND I WAS LIKE -- I IMMEDIATELY STARTED CRYING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ CRYING ] WHEN TOO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER. SHE WAS LIKE -- SHE THOUGHT I WAS HAVING A STROKE. OH MY GOD, ARE YOU OKAY?
DO YOU SMELL TOAST? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? IF YOU SAY YES, WILL YOU STOP THIS? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DO YOU SMELL TOAST? THAT IS -- YEAH, THAT'S A SIGN THAT YOU'RE HAVING A STROKE.
YEAH, I DID NOT -- I WAS NOT LIKE -- [ MICKEY MOUSE VOICE ] WILL YOU MAKE ME THE HAPPIEST MAN --
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
SO, WE GOT A ROOM AT THE CHATEAU MARMONT. I TOLD HER THERE WAS GOING TO BE A PARTY THERE. I HAD THE HOTEL. I GO, "JUST BUY A CRAP TON OF WILDFLOWERS, JUST THROW THEM ALL OVER THE ROOM."
Jimmy: AW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
SO WE WALK INTO THIS ROOM -- I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT'S FUNNY, SIR, THAT WAS ROMANTIC! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, CAN WE GET A A CRAP TON OF FLOWER?
HOW DARE YOU! HOW DARE YOU DIMINISH MY LOVE!

Jimmy: GOOD. ♪♪
SO, I DID. I GOT DOWN AND DID -- [ LAUGHTER ] BUT -- I'LL JUST GO BACK INTO THE STORY.
Jimmy: AND SHE SAID -- SHE SAID YEAH.
SHE SAID YES. NOW, SHE -- HER MOTHER, WHO I'D BEEN PLOTTING WITH FOR A COUPLE WEEKS, GAVE ME THIS FAMILY HEIRLOOM OF A RING, WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE. SO I HAD TO GIVE HER A CANDY RING. I GAVE HER THIS CANDY RING. BUT OF COURSE, IMMEDIATELY, I HAD TO SOIL IT WITH, LIKE, "THIS ISN'T THE REAL RING!" LIKE, I DIDN'T WANT HER TO THINK, "OH, YOU'RE TRYING TO BE ROMANTIC AND BE A CHEAPSKATE."
Jimmy: THIS TYPE OF THING?
NO, I FEEL THIS FITS MORE LIKE -- [ MICKEY MOUSE VOICE ] WILL YOU MAKE ME THE HAPPIEST MAN --
Jimmy: THAT WOULD BE REALLY CREEPY. THAT WOULD BE THE CREEPIEST THING EVER.
SO, SHE SAID YES AND NOW WE'RE GETTING MARRIED NEXT YEAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

"FUNCOMFORTABLE" TOUR.
Jimmy: "FUNCOMFORTABLE." SO, HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH "FUNCOMFORTABLE"?
UM, IT'S -- DO YOU KNOW MIKE BIRBIGLIA? A COMIC NAMED MIKE BIRBIGLIA?
Jimmy: I LOVE MIKE BIRBIGLIA.
BIRBIGLIA'S A GREAT STAND-UP, AND HE SAID SOMETHING TO ME A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT RESONATED. HE SAID, "I GO TO A PLACE WHERE I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND THAT'S WHERE I WRITE FROM." SO I STARTED TELLING THESE STORIES THAT I SHOULD NEVER TELL IN PUBLIC ABOUT JUST EMBARRASSING THINGS THAT I'VE DONE. AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THE GENESIS OF IT WAS. SO, THERE ARE A LOT OF STORIES IN THERE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE SAYING IN PUBLIC THAT PEOPLE ARE PAYING TO SEE.
