Jimmy: A HIGH FIVE. OH, HI, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, BABY. THIS IS -- YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE SHOW, MAN. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE IT'S A BIG STORY OUT OF WASHINGTON. ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS RECUSED HIMSELF FROM ANY INVESTIGATIONS INTO TRUMP'S TIES WITH RUSSIA. YEAH. HE RECUSED HIMSELF, BUT HE STILL CLAIMS HE DID NOT LIE UNDER OATH. THEN HE SAID, "I'M NOT UNDER OATH RIGHT NOW, AM I? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT IF I AM, YOU GOT TO TELL ME." SO AS YOU EXPECTED, MANY PEOPLE AREN'T VERY UPSET WITH JEFF SESSIONS. BUT WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER SAID THAT WHEN SESSIONS DENIED HAVING CONTACT WITH RUSSIA, HE WAS BEING 100% STRAIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] EVEN MIKE PENCE WAS LIKE, "COME ON, NO ONE IS 100% STRAIGHT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, NOW, A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE CALLING FOR HIM TO RESIGN AND SESSIONS IS ALREADY LOOKING INTO SOME OTHER CAREERS IN CASE HE'S FORCED OUT. FOR EXAMPLE, HE COULD LOOK AFTER HIS THREE SONS, SNAP, CRACKLE AND POP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE COULD POSE AS A BEFORE MODEL IN AN AD FOR EAR REDUCTION SURGERY. THAT'S A JOB. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT'S A JOB.
Jimmy: THAT'S AN OPTION.

Steve: LOVE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE JUST SHOWS UP AT DIFFERENT SPOTS. IT'S A GREAT SHOW.
Steve: FANTASTIC SHOW.
Jimmy: NOW, IF HE DOES END UP RESIGNING, IT COULD MEAN THAT TRUMP WOULD LOSE ANOTHER ONE OF HIS TOP OFFICIALS. THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THIS COMMERCIAL I SAW. ♪♪
THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION IS PROUD TO ANNOUNCE ITS NEWEST HOTEL, TRUMP RESIGNATION RESORT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE WORLD'S ONLY RESORT EXCLUSIVELY FOR EX-TRUMP OFFICIALS WHO WERE FIRED OR RESIGNED.

[ LAUGHTER ] IN ABE LINCOLN'S BEARD!" [ APPLAUSE ] AWFUL IMPRESSION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HEY, GUYS, HERE'S A LITTLE BUSINESS NEWS. I READ THAT SNAPCHAT'S IPO LAUNCHED ON THE STOCK MARKET YESTERDAY. OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, SOMETHING THAT YOUR PARENTS DON'T UNDERSTAND JUST LAUNCHED ON SOMETHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU HELP EACH OTHER OUT. AND FINALLY THIS IS PRETTY COOL. THIS WEEK, FRESNO STATE WAS PLAYING BOISE STATE IN COLLEGE BASKETBALL AND THE BALL GOT STUCK ABOVE THE BASKET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEY TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET IT BACK DOWN UNTIL ONE FAN CAME TO THE RESCUE. CHECK THIS OUT.
JESSUP, POUNDS IT HIGH IN THE AIR. OVER THE BACKBOARD OUT OF BOUNDS. 6'11" THE FRESHMAN OUT OF BRAZIL. HE'S MAKING CONTACT, BUT HE CAN'T QUITE GET IT FREE. OH AND HERE'S A LITTLE FELLA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

OH GOD.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
NO.
Jimmy: JOHN LITHGOW, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR PLAYING THAT GAME WITH ME.
OH THAT GAME, MY GOD, MY HEART IS STILL POUNDING.
Jimmy: REALLY, RIGHT. IT IS. IT'S NERVE-RACKING.
I'M SO COMPETITIVE.
Jimmy: YOU REALLY ARE.
SEVEN YEARS AGO I PLAYED TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE WITH YOU AND I LOST. YOU BEAT ME, AND I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ARE YOU SERIOUS? TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE. THAT'S WHERE I HAD TO GUESS WHICH ONE IS THE FAKE STORY. I GOT IT RIGHT?
I TOSS AND TURN ALL NIGHT EVER SINCE.
Jimmy: YOU THINK OF THAT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: REALLY? DID I RUB IT IN? DID I REALLY GET EXCITED?
YOU RUBBED IT IN.
Jimmy: I SOMETIMES GET TO EXCITED WHEN I WIN, SO I'M VERY COMPETITIVE. WAS IT AN OBVIOUS LIE?
WELL, LET'S SEE NOW, I SAID THAT I COULD FOLD A CLOTH NAPKIN INTO AN ORIGAMI BIRD. THAT I WAS RELATED TO ORSON WELLES AND THAT I HAD GONE TO VETERINARY SCHOOL. DO YOU REMEMBER WHICH ONE YOU PICKED?
Jimmy: I WOULD SAY -- I COULD SEE YOU DOING ORIGAMI. YOU KIND OF DID IT THERE.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: RELATED TO ORSON WELLES. VETERINARY SCHOOL. VETERINARY SCHOOL.
YES.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE LIE.
YOU'VE STILL GOT IT.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE LIE. THAT'S THE LIE.
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D FORGOTTEN. THAT'S THE LIE.
Jimmy: YOU CAN TRY IT AGAIN IF YOU WANT. IF YOU REALLY THINK OF --
ALL RIGHT. LET'S TRY IT AGAIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LET'S SAY THAT I DO A PERFECT IMITATION OF MISS PIGGY.
Jimmy: ARE YOU CHANGING YOUR STYLE OF STORYTELLING?
NO, I'M NOT. I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK OF EXCELLENT ONES. THAT WHEN I WAS A CHILD MY BABY-SITTER WAS CORETTA SCOTT KING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT I PAINT PICTURES OF PETS FOR FUND-RAISER SILENT AUCTIONS. WATERCOLOR PORTRAITS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THERE ARE TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE IN THERE.
Jimmy: TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE. OKAY, YOU CAN DO A MISS PIGGY IMPERSONATION.
A PERFECT ONE.
Jimmy: YOUR BABY-SITTER WAS --
CORETTA SCOTT KING BEFORE SHE WAS MARRIED TO THE REVEREND MARTIN LUTHER KING. AND THE THIRD, THAT I PAINT WATERCOLOR PORTRAITS OF PETS FOR FUND-RAISER SILENT AUCTIONS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THINK ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHAT IS THE LEAST LIKELY?
Jimmy: YOU KNOW WHAT, I HEARD YOU DO YODA EARLIER AS WE WERE PLAYING THE GAME. I THINK THE SAME ACTOR DOES THE VOICE OF MISS PIGGY, FRANK OZ, AND YOUR YODA WAS OKAY. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS PERFECT. I'M GOING TO SAY THAT'S THE LIE.
THAT'S THE LIE. MY MISS PIGGY SUCKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I GOT IT AGAIN. ♪♪
Jimmy: HOW DO I GET THIS?
I DO A GOOD YODA. I DO A GREAT GROVER. NOW I AM GETTING CLOSER.
Jimmy: YES. THAT IS --
NOW I AM LOOKING --
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT.
BUT MY MISS PIGGY, I WOULDN'T EVEN DARE.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S TOO HIGH. WAIT, I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE BABY-SITTING STORY.
NO, NO, SHE GENUINELY -- SHE WAS MY -- WHEN SHE WAS CORETTA SCOTT, SHE BABY-SAT FOR ME AND MY SIBLINGS IN YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO.
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT AMAZING.
I MET HER WHEN SHE -- WHEN I WAS AN ADULT AND SHE WAS A GOOD FRIEND OF A PRODUCER OF A PLAY I WAS IN AND SHE REMEMBERED ME VERY FONDLY.
Jimmy: OH, I LOVE THAT.
APPARENTLY I WAS NOT THAT HARD TO TAKE CARE OF.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A GOOD BOY. THEN THE WATERCOLOR THING. I CAN SEE YOU. YOU'RE AN ARTIST.
YEAH.
Jimmy: DID YOU GET TAUGHT? ARE YOU PROFESSIONALLY TAUGHT? DID YOU HAVE A PRIVATE TEACHER?
WHEN I STARTED OUT, I WANTED TO BE A PAINTER. I WANTED TO AVOID BEING AN ACTOR. I GREW UP IN A THEATER FAMILY. I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO THE FAMILY BUSINESS. BUT BY NOW IT'S MERELY DWINDLED INTO THESE LITTLE HOBBIES, BUT I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING.
Jimmy: YES.
SINCE I PAINT, SINCE I PAINT PORTRAITS OF PETS, I'VE DONE A A PAINTING FOR YOU.
Jimmy: MY GOSH. THAT'S MY DOG.
THAT'S GARY FRICK. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT --
Jimmy: THAT'S MY DOG -- THAT'S MY DOG GARY.
WHEN I FIND OUT ABOUT GARY FRICK, I DECIDED THAT'S MY GIFT TO YOU.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE NICEST THING. THAT'S THE NICEST THING EVER.
YOU SEE, THAT'S NOT BAD.
Jimmy: CHECK IT OUT. THAT'S HER COLLAR. YEAH, WE HAVE LIKE A TEAL COLLAR OF LIKE A --
YEAH, AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DONATE TO CHARITY.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NOW I'M GOING TO NOW THAT YOU SAID IT. OF COURSE, I'M GOING TO. DUH. YEAH. I'M SO TOUCHED. THIS IS GORGEOUS. IS THAT WATERCOLOR?
IT'S NOT A BAD LIKENESS. I'VE ONLY SEEN PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID WITH THIS COLLAR, IT WAS LIKE A A FAKE LEATHER COLLAR. WE HAVE A 3-YEAR-OLD WHO -- HER PANTS LIKE DON'T FIT PERFECT. AND WE USE THE DOG COLLAR AS A A BELT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT FITS PERFECT.
BUT IT'S THE PERFECT COLOR, ISN'T IT?
Jimmy: I CAN'T BELIEVE. MY WIFE'S GOING TO GO CRAZY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I JUST THOUGHT I'D BE SNEAKY.
Jimmy: WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH, BUDDY. CONGRATS, BY THE WAY, ON THE CROWN. WE TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT LAST TIME WHEN YOU WERE HERE AND YOU DID IMPRESSIONS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GOT INTO CHARACTER.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU PUT THE MOUTH THING IN.
I DID MY PROGRESSO SOUP PITCH WITH MY CHURCHILL COWL.
Jimmy: CAUSE, YEAH -- THAT'S HOW FUN YOU ARE, BUT I'VE GOT TO SAY AFTER YOU CAME ON, THAT IS THE ONLY THING PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT FOR MONTHS. THEY KEPT SAYING, HAVE YOU SEEN "THE CROWN" YET? DUDE, THAT'S MY CROWN, MY FRIEND.

IT IS WONDERFUL.
Jimmy: I MEAN -- I DON'T SEE YOU IN MY BRAIN AS PLAYING WINSTON CHURCHILL. NOW I DO. BUT HOW DOES THE CASTING DIRECTOR SEE THAT?
I DON'T -- HONESTLY, I WAS SHOCKED WHEN THEY CAST ME.
Jimmy: ME TOO.
WHEN THEY OFFERED IT TO ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOT SHOCKED BECAUSE YOU'RE GREAT, BUT I MEAN -- EVERYONE ELSE IS BRITISH.
YEAH, EVERYONE ELSE IS -- WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT CHURCHILL'S MOTHER WAS AMERICAN. THAT'S ONE THING, BUT BEYOND THAT --
Jimmy: THAT'S WHY YOU WERE CAST. WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT IF THAT'S WHY YOU WERE CAST.
PETER MORGAN, THE WRITER OF THE SERIES, HE EXPLAINED THAT IN ENGLAND THEY SUFFERED FROM A A CERTAIN CHURCHILL FATIGUE. ALL THE GREAT KNIGHTS, ALL THE MAJOR ACTORS, ALBERT FINNEY, BRIAN COX IS DOING IT THIS YEAR, EVEN GARY OLDMAN, TIMOTHY SPALL, THAT THERE WAS A A CERTAIN CHURCHILL FATIGUE HAD SET IN, THEY NEEDED SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. GOD KNOWS I'M DIFFERENT, BUT IT WORKED OUT GREAT. I'M LIKE 18 INCHES TALLER THAN HE WAS. PEOPLE DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND THAT.
Jimmy: YOU PUT THE THINGS IN YOUR MOUTH, THE BRANDOESQUE THINGS.
I KNOW, I BARELY RECOGNIZE MYSELF.
