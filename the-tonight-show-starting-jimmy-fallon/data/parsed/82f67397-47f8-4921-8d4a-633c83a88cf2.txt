Jimmy: THANK YOU! HEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A HOT CROWD RIGHT THERE. HOT CROWD. WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE! THIS IS IT. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. I SAW THIS. TODAY IS VLADIMIR PUTIN'S 62nd BIRTHDAY. YEP, HE CELEBRATED THE WAY HE ALWAYS DOES, HAVING SOMEONE ELSE TRY HIS CAKE BEFORE HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU EAT FIRST, WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YOU BETTER MAKE A WISH, IT MIGHT BE YOUR LAST. [ LAUGHTER ] VLADIMIR PUTIN'S 62 YEARS-OLD TODAY. MUST BE TOUGH BUYING HIM A A GIFT. I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU GET THE MAN WHO HAS EVERYWHERE? [ LAUGHTER ] SOME MORE INTERNATIONAL NEWS. THE NEW ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAID THAT HE AND PRESIDENT OBAMA TALK TO EACH OTHER SO MUCH THAT THEY'RE LIKE AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THE REAL STORY IS THAT BENJAMIN NETANYAHU THINKS THAT OLD MARRIED COUPLES TALK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MY PARENTS HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING BUT, "WHERE'S THE REMOTE?" OR, "HUH?" IN 15 YEARS. [ APPLAUSE ] "WHAT?" "HUH?" "HUH?" "WHAT?" "WHAT?" "WHAT?" "HUH?" "WHAT?" "HUH?" [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF OBAMA, THE WHITE HOUSE DISMISSED FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY LEON PANETTA'S CRITICISMS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA, SAYING THAT HE'S FACED SOME THE MOST DIFFICULT ISSUES OF OUR TIME. WHICH WOULD BE A GREAT DEFENSE IF EVERY PRESIDENT DIDN'T FACE THE MOST DIFFICULT ISSUES OF THEIR TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE JOB. YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT, THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT A PRESIDENT DOES. OF COURSE, JOE BIDEN, HE'S JUST NOT HELPING. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S HELPING OUR MONOLOGUES BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S TAKING A LOT OF HEAT FOR SUGGESTING THAT TURKEY IS PARTIALLY TO BLAME FOR ISIS GETTING STRONGER. AND, YEAH, WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY HEARD THAT, HE GOT VERY MAD. HE WAS LIKE, "WAIT, WHAT? I DIDN'T SAY THAT." SO BIDEN CALLED HIM TO APOLOGIZE, AND WE ACTUALLY GOT A HOLD OF THE RECORDING OF THE CONVERSATION.
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. I'M NOT SURE IF BIDEN KNEW WHO HE WAS TALKING TO. I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. JUST LISTEN TO THIS.
HELLO, MR. PRESIDENT. I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW SORRY I AM FOR MISQUOTING YOU. IT WAS JUST A HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING, AND WELL, I HOPE YOU'LL ACCEPT MY APOLOGY. [ TURKEY GOBBLING ] [ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING, SIR.
Jimmy: YEAH, HE UNDERSTANDS. THE TURKEY -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: OH. HE'S TALKING TO A BIRD, A A TURKEY.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT TURKEY GOT A PHONE ANYWAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: THAT'S WEIRD. AND HOW DO YOU GET THE PHONE NUMBER TO THE TURKEY?
Jimmy: YEAH AND HOW DID THE TURKEY TEACH ITSELF TO ANSWER THE PHONE? WAIT FOR THE QUESTION OR THE APOLOGY, AND THEN RESPOND. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO INTERVIEW THAT TURKEY, MAN.
Steve: I'D BE TALKING TO HIM.

HE TOLD AMISH RESIDENTS HE UNDERSTANDS THEIR CONCERNS AND HE WILL RESPECT THEIR WISHES. AND THEN HE WENT ON TV AND SAID, "NO." [ LAUGHTER ] "THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS ANYWAY." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? THAT'S RIGHT, AMISH PEOPLE ARE ANGRY OVER PLANS TO BUILD A A CASINO NEAR THEIR COMMUNITY. THEY SAY IT ISN'T FAIR BECAUSE THEY WERE ON THE LAND FIRST. AND THEN THE NATIVE AMERICANS WHO WANT TO BUILD THE CASINO WERE LIKE, "YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?" [ LAUGHTER ] LAST NIGHT, ANOTHER GREAT EPISODE OF "DANCING WITH THE STARS" OVER ON ABC. GOSH, WE LOVE THAT SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] A LOT OF TIMES IT'S SURPRISING TO SEE HOW GOOD AT DANCING SOME OF THESE CELEBRITIES ARE. YOU KNOW, BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK. TAKE A LOOK.

I REALLY GOT INTO TANGO WHEN I WAS IN JAIL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO, DON'T CLAP! [ LAUGHTER ] [ TOMMY CHONG IMPRESSION ] "I LEARNED HOW TO TANGO IN PRISON, MAN." [ LAUGHTER ] DID YOU GUYS HEAR ABOUT THIS? THIS IS GREAT. LAST WEEK A A SPOKESMAN FOR THE TALIBAN ACCIDENTLY REVEALED HIS LOCATION AFTER HE SENT OUT A A TWEET THAT SHOWED EXACTLY WHERE HE WAS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW THE SECRET SERVICE IS LIKE, PLEASE DON'T LET HIM BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S BEEN A ROUGH COUPLE WEEKS. IT'S BEEN A BAD TWO WEEKS. OH, MY GOSH, PLEASE. THAT'S RIGHT, THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE TALIBAN REVEALED HIS LOCATION AFTER HE SENT OUT A A TWEET THAT SHOWED EXACTLY WHERE HE WAS, OR AS HE PUT IT, "UHH -- IT WAS THROWBACK THURSDAY?" [ LAUGHTER ] "I SAID 'DEATH TO AMERICA' LIKE TEN YEARS AGO?" [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS PRETTY COOL. I SAW THAT THE EIFFEL TOWER JUST INSTALLED A GLASS FLOOR THAT LETS TOURISTS SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HUNDREDS OF FEET BELOW THEM. YEP, IT CELEBRATES FRANCE'S FAVORITE PASTIME, LOOKING DOWN ON PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "YOU FILTHY AMERICANS." AND FINALLY, WITH REPORTS THAT THE NEW iPHONE 6 IS BENDING -- PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S BENDING IF YOU SIT ON IT. YEAH.

SEVERAL OF THEM. L.A. COUNTY, I'VE BEEN TO A A COUPLE OF MENTAL ONES. I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE IN JAIL. WITHOUT QUESTION. BECAUSE IN JAIL, YOU CAN AT LEAST HAVE A CONVERSATION.

HERE'S HOW PEOPLE THINK IN JAIL. JAIL PEOPLE THINK, "I NEEDED MONEY, SO I STOLE A CAR." IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION PEOPLE THINK, "I NEEDED MONEY, SO I [ BLEEP ] AT THE MALL."
