WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE -- HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I SAW THIS TODAY. AT THE WHITE HOUSE, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD LUNCH WITH JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE. AND OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER, TRUMP DECIDED TO EAT HIS DORITOS USING CHOPSTICKS.
Steve: OH. [ LAUGHTER ] NICE.
Jimmy: PRESIDENT TRUMP ACTUALLY GREETED JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE WITH A HUG. TRUMP SAID HE WOULD HAVE BOWED, BUT IT WASN'T LIKE HE WAS MEETING VLADIMIR PUTIN OR ANYTHING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AT THE END OF THEIR MEETING, TRUMP AND ABE SHARED A A HANDSHAKE FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS, BUT IT FELT LIKE IT WENT ON A A LITTLE TOO LONG. AND -- THIS IS REAL.

BUT SHE'S NOT USING IT IN A A DEROGATORY WAY. SHE'S A FEMALE DOG.
Jimmy: I KNOW. FEMALE DOG, I KNOW. I LIKE THAT, I THINK IT'S GOOD.

Jimmy: THAT'S VERY GOOD. THAT'S FANTASTIC. HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN DOING THIS?
ONLY TWO MONTHS.

Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. [ APPLAUSE ] HE'S THE GREATEST, BY THE WAY.
HE'S THE BEST. AND THAT THING AT THE END IS A A MOVE HE LIKES TO DO TO PAPARAZZI. IF EVERYONE IS TRYING TO TAKE A A PICTURE OF HIM, HE JUST RUNS DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA GROWLING AND SCARES THEM, MORE THAN THEY COULD EVER SCARE HIM.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT.
IT REALLY WORKS.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS HE TALKING ABOUT? WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE CREW? DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT?
WELL, WHAT I THINK -- SHE'S WORKING WITH YOUR NOSE. WHAT I THINK IS HE'S TALKING ABOUT, IS ON THE FIRST DAY OF SHOOTING "GIRLS," I WAS DOING A A NAKED SCENE, WHICH I DON'T THINK WILL SURPRISE ANYBODY, A A NUDE SCENE.
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE NUDE IN A BATHTUB, EATING A A CUPCAKE.
Jimmy: THAT WAS YOUR FIRST SCENE, IN THE WHOLE "GIRLS?"
THAT WAS THE FIRST SCENE. I WAS DIRECTING, "PILOT."
Jimmy: SHE'S EATING PAPER, SORRY.
AND YOU KNOW YOU COULDN'T SEE MY BOOBS OR MY UNDER STUFF, BUT, I JUST FELT LIKE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT I COULD WEAR, LIKE, NUDE UNDERGARMENTS. I THOUGHT LIKE, "OH, TO BE SUPER REAL I GOT TO BE NAKED. I GOT TO BE NAKED." AND FINALLY THE COSTUME PERSON CAME UP TO ME. SHE WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF WEIRD THAT YOU'RE NAKED, WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE YOUR -- WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE IT. SO, WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUT ON A A NUDE --" I'LL JUST TAKE THIS OVER HERE.

Jimmy: WE DO THE SAME THING. WE DO THE SAME THING.
I WAS DIRECTING AND I WAS INSISTING --
Jimmy: YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIRECT NUDE.
UPON BEING NAKED IN A SCENE WHERE, LIKE -- YOU KNOW, WHEN, LIKE, REESE WITHERSPOON DOES A A SEX SCENE. AND THE SHEETS ARE UP TO, HERE SHE'S NOT SECRETLY FULLY NUDE UNDER THE COVERS.
Jimmy: NO.
SHE'S WEARING UNDERWEAR LIKE A REASONABLE HUMAN. I WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING TO BE SO REAL THAT I'M GOING TO BE NAKED FOR THE WHOLE DAY." AND FINALLY JUDD CAME UP TO ME, AND HE WAS LIKE, "YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE MAKING THE CREW KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE USED TO PEOPLE -- YEAH.
Jimmy: WE'RE ACTORS. WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS. YEAH, YOU CAN PUT CLOTHES ON. WE GET IT.
YEAH, LIKE -- AND I WAS LIKE, "NO. I'M BRAVE. I'M A BRAVE WOMAN." AND HE'S LIKE, "WE GET IT. PUT A BRA ON." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I THINK AFTER THAT, THE CREW WAS LIKE, "OKAY. THERE'S NOTHING WE REALLY CAN'T DO AROUND THIS PERSON."
Jimmy: VERY GOOD.
AND THAT WAS SIX YEARS OF LOVE.
Jimmy: OH.
AND THEN ABOUT THREE YEARS IN I QUIT WEARING UNDERGARMENTS AGAIN. SO I HAD A THREE-YEAR RUN WITH UNDERWEAR AND THEN A THREE-YEAR RUN WHERE I STOPPED.

THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT GEORGE WASHINGTON I DID RELATE TO, TO BE HONEST, AND THEN WHEN I WENT BACKSTAGE AND TALKED TO LIN, HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH. THAT WAS -- THAT CHARACTER'S LOOSELY BASED ON YOU." BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I COULD DO THAT GEORGE WASHINGTON CHARACTER. BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I LOVED ABOUT "HAMILTON" ALL THOSE CHARACTERS. YOU KIND OF LIKE LOSE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT GEORGE WASHINGTON OR THOMAS JEFFERSON IS. AND KIND OF SEE THEM AS REAL PEOPLE.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I DID TOO.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: I WAS FREAKED OUT, MAN.

Jimmy: YEAH! HE JUST REALLY PUNCHED ME IN THE FACE.
NAH. BUT SERIOUSLY, IT IS A LOT OF PREPARATION, CHOREOGRAPHY TO IT. BUT ONE THING --
Jimmy: THAT'S BRILLIANT.
ONE THING ABOUT CHAD IS THE DIRECTOR, HE -- WHEN YOU GET THERE, HE, LIKE, TRIES TO MAKE IT SPONTANEOUS AND GIVE YOU ALL OF THIS NEW STUFF AND KEANU IS THE BEST, MAN. I GOT TO SAY. HE'S LIKE THE GREATEST. SO I JUST WANTED TO BE AT THAT LEVEL AND WORK WITH HIM AT THAT LEVEL.
Jimmy: IS HE LIKE A A PERFECTIONIST?
YEAH, HE -- OH MAN. IF WE DON'T GET IT RIGHT, HE'S LIKE, "LET'S DO IT AGAIN." HE'S LIKE, "IT JUST DON'T HAVE THE FLAVOR. LET'S GET IT BETTER." I'M LIKE, "OKAY. WE'LL GET IT BETTER." AND WE JUST KEEP GOING UNTIL WE GET IT TO THE LEVEL WHERE IT'S RIGHT. BUT, THAT'S WHAT TYPE OF PERSON I AM. SO I WAS GLAD TO WORK WITH KEANU.
