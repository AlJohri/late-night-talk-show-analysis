Questlove: 619! DIEGO!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HEY, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LOOKING GOOD TONIGHT. HOT CROWD. HOT CROWD. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, BABY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE. THIS IS THE SHOW! WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. TODAY THE SENATE OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED BETSY DeVOS AS EDUCATION SECRETARY WITH A VOTE OF 51 -- [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S 51% OF THE AUDIENCE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] A VOTE OF 51 TO 50. THAT WAS THE VOTE, YEAH. OR AS TRUMP CALLS THAT, "A LANDSLIDE." [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY IT WAS A 50-50 TIE VOTE THAT WAS BROKEN BY THE VICE PRESIDENT. WHICH MAKES THE VOTE FOR EDUCATION SECRETARY THE ONLY PLACE WHERE 51 IS A PASSING GRADE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BETSY DeVOS IS CONFIRMED AS EDUCATION SECRETARY DESPITE NOT HAVING ANY EXPERIENCE IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. WHEN ASKED WHY HE NOMINATED HER IN THE FIRST PLACE, TRUMP SAID --
I LOVE THE POORLY EDUCATED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HOW SWEET OF HIM. SO SWEET.
Jimmy: THERE WERE EVEN REPORTS THIS WEEK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO LIKES TO WATCH TV WHILE SITTING AROUND IN A BATHROBE. HIS PRESS SECRETARY, SEAN SPICER, DENIED THIS, SAYING HE DOESN'T THINK THE PRESIDENT EVEN OWNS A BATHROBE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, EVERYONE IN AMERICA IS LIKE, "STOP MAKING US PICTURE DONALD TRUMP IN A A BATHROBE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DROP IT ALREADY. MOVE ON! "SORRY. IT KEEPS COMING UNTIED. OOPS." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: "LOOKS LIKE I'M UP IN THE POLLS." [ LAUGHTER ] "THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF." [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE AWS ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: I HAD TO GET DEBRIEFED.
Jimmy: OH, THERE YOU GO. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: OY!
Jimmy: THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTS THAT TRUMP IS APPARENTLY OBSESSED WITH THE DECOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE. YEP. THOUGH THERE WAS ONE AWKWARD MOMENT WHEN HE SPENT FIVE MINUTES DUSTING A STATUE BEFORE HE REALIZED IT WAS MIKE PENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] DIDN'T WANT TO DISTURB YOU. I SAW THAT PEOPLE AREN'T ABLE TO GO ON TOURS OF THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE MELANIA TRUMP STILL HASN'T HIRED SOMEONE TO HEAD UP THE WHITE HOUSE VISITORS OFFICE. I GUESS IN THE MEANTIME, DONALD HAS RECORDED AN AUDIO TOUR SO PEOPLE CAN TOUR THE WHITE HOUSE THEMSELVES. IT REALLY GIVES A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT EACH ROOM. HERE, TAKE A LISTEN TO THIS.
THIS IS THE LINCOLN BEDROOM. IT'S WHERE ABE LINCOLN SLEPT WITH HIS WIFE. IT'S VERY RARE. USUALLY PRESIDENTS AREN'T ALLOWED TO SHARE A BED WITH THEIR WIVES FOR SECURITY PURPOSES. THAT'S WHAT MELANIA TELLS ME. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE YELLOW OVAL ROOM, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE OVAL OFFICE. BUT MORE THAN ONCE I SPENT AN ENTIRE DAY SITTING IN HERE, BECAUSE I GOT THE TWO CONFUSED. BUT IT WORKED OUT. I GOT A LOT OF TWEETING DONE. THIS IS THE MAP ROOM. STEVE BANNON AND I LIKE TO COME IN HERE AND THROW DARTS AT THE MAP TO DECIDE WHO TO FIGHT WITH NEXT. EVERYBODY HAS A GOOD TIME. THIS IS THE BLUE ROOM AND ALL I CAN THINK OF WHEN I'M HERE IS THAT SHOW "BLUE'S CLUES." I ALWAYS GUESS ALL THE CLUES, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. SOMETIMES BEFORE STEVE COULD EVEN GIVE THEM. HE WAS A BORING HOST. JUST LIKE ARNOLD. THIS IS THE CHINA ROOM. IT'S WHERE WE STORE ALL THE PRECIOUS WHITE HOUSE CHINA. REMEMBER THAT SONG THAT WENT, "CHICKITY CHINA, THE CHINESE CHICKEN?" WAS THAT BARENAKED LADIES? WHO WERE NEITHER BARE NAKED OR LADIES. FAKE NEWS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. CHINA ROOM?
Steve: CHINA. CHINA.
Jimmy: GUYS, I SAW THAT THE GROUP BEHIND THE WOMEN'S MARCH ON WASHINGTON JUST ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A WOMEN'S STRIKE, CALLING IT "A DAY WITHOUT A A WOMAN." WE ACTUALLY HAVE VIDEO OF WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF EVERY WOMAN DID GO ON STRIKE AND MEN WERE LEFT TO HANDLE EVERYTHING BY THEMSELVES. TAKE A LOOK.
OH! [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH. SCARY STUFF. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LET'S GET TO SOME SPORTS. TODAY, THE PATRIOTS CELEBRATED THEIR BIG SUPER BOWL WIN UP IN BOSTON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I READ THAT TOM BRADY IS STILL TRYING TO TRACK DOWN HIS JERSEY THAT WENT MISSING AFTER THE GAME. YEAH. THEN O.J. SAID, "WHATEVER YOU DO, JUST DON'T TRY TO STEAL IT BACK. TRUST ME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "DIDN'T -- DIDN'T WORK OUT SO GREAT FOR ME." I READ THAT SINCE HER SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW, LADY GAGA'S SALES HAVE INCREASED BY 1,000%. WHILE SALES OF BEDAZZLED, SHOULDER PAD LEOTARDS HAVE REMAINED EXACTLY THE SAME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] ONE. ONLY SOLD ONE OF THOSE. MORE CELEBRITY NEWS. I SAW THAT KYLIE MINOGUE WON A A LEGAL BATTLE AGAINST KYLIE JENNER OVER THE TRADEMARK OF THEIR NAME KYLIE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THE JUDGE CALLED THE CASE, "NOT WHY I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S A LOCAL STORY. IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT PLAYBOY IS REOPENING ITS CLUB IN NEW YORK CITY AFTER CLOSING DOWN THREE DECADES AGO. YOU COULD TELL IT'S THE PLAYBOY CLUB, BECAUSE IT'S HIDDEN UNDERNEATH A MATTRESS STORE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: THE OLDER CROWD.
Jimmy: NO, THEY GET IT. THEY GET IT. AND FINALLY, I SAW THAT MERRIAM-WEBSTER DICTIONARY ADDED OVER 1,000 NEW WORDS TODAY, INCLUDING THE WORD "PHOTOBOMB." THEY DIDN'T WANT TO ADD "PHOTOBOMB," BUT IT JUMPED IN AT THE LAST SECOND AND KIND OF RUINED THE DICTIONARY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT, GUYS.

Jimmy: YOU THINK? YOU DO STUFF THAT I -- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DO THAT AND YOU ALSO DO THIS THING THAT YOU WENT -- WING WALKING? AND I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS THING. THIS IS A TRUE THING. FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE THE OUTFIT. YOU GOT JODHPURS.
WELL, YES. SOMEONE INVITED ME TO GO WING WALKING. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS, BUT THEY TOLD ME I'D BE STANDING ON THE WING OF A 1940s BIPLANE AND I THOUGHT, WELL, I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOMEN USED TO DO IN THE 1920s SO I WENT TO A A COSTUME HOUSE IN LONDON AND HIRED WHAT I THOUGHT MIGHT BE AN APPROPRIATE OUTFIT.
Jimmy: I MEAN THIS IS PERFECT. IT LOOKS LIKES A PAINTING RIGHT THERE?
THERE'S A LITTLE BOMBER HAT AND THE JODHPURS, BUT WHAT I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE IS THAT, YOU KNOW, UP THERE IN THE SKY, YOU GOT A LOT OF FLAPPAGE FROM THOSE JODHPURS, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF WIND RESISTANCE.
Jimmy: NO WAY I WOULD DO THIS.
YOU'RE ON THE WING -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WOULDN'T DO IT WITH THE PLANE IN NEUTRAL. NOT -- WITH THE ENGINE NOT ON. I WOULDN'T GET ON A PLANE -- STAND ON A PLANE.
AND THEY WERE MADE IN THE 1940s, WHICH GIVES YOU A BIT OF PAUSE FOR THOUGHT BEFORE YOU -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT THIS IS FRIGHTENING. BUT LOOK, CAN YOU SEE YOU? THAT'S YOU?
THAT'S ME. OH, ACTUALLY, THAT'S ME BEFORE EVERYTHING WENT A LITTLE WRONG, BECAUSE -- YOU SEE I'VE GOT MY ARMS OUT AND I'M THINKING, THIS IS AMAZING. I FEEL SO FREE AND I WAS SORT OF HAVING A KIND OF--
Jimmy: LEO DiCAPRIO.
KATE WINSLET, LEO DiCAPRIO MOMENT.
AND THEN I THOUGHT, I'M JUST GOING TO PUT MY HEAD BACK AND THEN I COULDN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME GET MY HEAD BACK ON TOP OF MY NECK AGAIN BECAUSE THE -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT THROWS YOU BACK.
BECAUSE OF THE -- YEAH, THE G FORCE, OR WHATEVER IT IS.
Jimmy: YOU WERE LIKE THIS?
YOU'RE LIKE, OH, MY GOD! HOW AM I ACTUALLY --
Jimmy: WITH THE JODHPURS FLAPPING, YEAH.
GET MY HEAD BACK ON TOP OF MY NECK!
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW THIS IS -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE. YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE. I LOVE THAT YOU DO THIS STUFF. PAL, LET'S TALK ABOUT "A UNITED KINGDOM." IT'S A, DAVID OYELOWO, WHO WE LOVE. HE'S BEEN ON THE SHOW A BUNCH OF TIMES.
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: DO YOU WANT TO SET UP THE -- THE MOVIE, WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
IT'S A LOVE STORY. IT'S A WONDERFUL, HOPEFUL LOVE STORY SET IN THE 1940s. IT'S ABOUT AN AFRICAN MAN WHO CAME FROM BOTSWANA LAND, WHICH WE NOW KNOW AS BOTSWANA. AND HE WAS DUE TO BE EFFECTIVELY THE KING, THE CHIEF OF THE LARGEST TRIBE THERE AND HE CAME TO LONDON AND HE FELL IN LOVE WITH A GIRL FROM SOUTHEAST LONDON WHO WAS A A PRETTY ORDINARY GIRL, FOR WHOM LIFE WAS FOREVERMORE CHANGED BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH THIS MAN. WHICH I THINK, LOVE IS ALWAYS RADICAL TO A DEGREE. BUT IN THE 1940s, A MIX RACED MARRIAGE WAS PARTICULARLY RADICAL, AND THEY BROUGHT DOWN A TON OF OPPOSITION ON THEIR HEADS FROM THEIR FAMILIES, FROM SOCIETY, AND ACTUALLY FROM, ON A GOVERNMENT LEVEL.
Jimmy: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. HERE'S ROSAMUND PIKE AND DAVID OYELOWO IN "A UNITED KINGDOM." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
ALL I -- ALL I ASK OF YOU IS THAT YOU GO AWAY AND THINK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE THIS -- THIS IS A LOT TO THINK ABOUT. AND --
