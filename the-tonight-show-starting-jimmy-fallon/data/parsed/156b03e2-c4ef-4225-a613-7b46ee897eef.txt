Jimmy: HEY, HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU! OH, THAT IS A HOT CROWD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALREADY I LOVE YOU GUYS. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN. WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I LOVE YOU TOO, MAN. LET'S'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THINGS ARE STILL VERY TENSE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA OVER THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE. AND GET THIS, INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ARE NOW SAYING THAT THEY HAD A HARD TIME PREDICTING RUSSIA'S INVASION BECAUSE VLADIMIR PUTIN DOESN'T OWN A A CELL PHONE OR USE THE INTERNET. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I GUESS HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TRACKED. BUT YOU CAN TELL PUTIN DOESN'T SPEND MUCH TIME ONLINE. BECAUSE WHEN HE SENDS, "LOL," HE MEANS, "LOOK OUT, LATVIA." [ LAUGHTER ] [ IMITATING PUTIN ] "I'M COMING FOR YOU, NEXT." PUTIN DOESN'T HAVE A CELL PHONE AND JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WITHOUT A PHONE, HE WON'T STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT. [ IMITATING PUTIN ] "I DON'T EVEN OWN A TELEVISION SO --" A LITTLE CORKY THING. PUTIN APPARENTLY DOESN'T USE THE INTERNET BECAUSE HE IS AFRAID OF BEING TRACKED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. AND 'CAUSE ANY TIME HE NEEDS TO KNOW SOMETHING, HE CAN JUST ASK EDWARD SNOWDEN. [ LAUGHTER ] SO HE'S GOT IT TAKEN CARE OF. [ APPLAUSE ] HE JUST CALLS -- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO PUTIN -- LISTEN TO THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT, UKRAINE JUST SAID IT FINISHED WITHDRAWING THE LAST OF ITS TROOPS FROM CRIMEA. SO THE SPLIT IS NOW FINAL. WELL, THEY'RE NOT CALLING IT A A SPLIT. THEY ARE CALLING IT A A "CONSCIOUS UNCOUPLING." BUT STILL, IT'S -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS STILL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN UKRAINE. AND DURING A SPEECH TODAY IN BELGIUM, OBAMA CALLED FOR A A UNITED FRONT WITH EUROPE AGAINST RUSSIA. OBAMA PROMISED THAT IF RUSSIA INVADES ANOTHER COUNTRY, AMERICA WILL STAND BEHIND EUROPE -- WAY, WAY, WAY BEHIND. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ITALY, LET YOU GO FIRST. LET US KNOW. A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE ARE HAVING TROUBLE KEEPING UP WITH ALL OF THIS. BUT ONE THING AMERICANS DON'T HAVE TROUBLE KEEPING UP WITH IS "DANCING WITH THE STARS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PEOPLE LOVE THAT SHOW. I LOVE THAT SHOW. SO WITH THAT IN MIND, WE SENT OUR WRITER, ARTHUR, DOWN TO THE STREETS TO ASK PEOPLE THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE UKRAINE, WITH ONE CATCH. THEY HAD TO DANCE THE ENTIRE TIME THEY ANSWERED. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE, BUT THEY'RE DANCING. WE CALL IT "QUESTIONS AND DANCERS." ♪♪
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE CURRENT TENSIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA?
WELL, I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS FOR BOTH COUNTRIES TO NOT CALL INTO A COLD WAR PARANOIA.
WELL, I THINK IT'S TIME THAT OBAMA STANDS UP AND SHOWS PUTIN WHAT AMERICA IS MADE OF.
WELL, THE ONLY WAY I THINK THAT WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS WITH PATIENCE AND DIPLOMACY OVER THERE.
I THINK THE PEOPLE OF THE UKRAINE ARE INNOCENT. THEY NEVER ASK FOR ANY OF THIS.
AND YOU KNOW, HE TAKES OVER UKRAINE -- IS HE GONNA STOP FROM THERE? HE'S GONNA GO LIKE TO POLAND? OR ANYWHERE ELSE. I DON'T KNOW, MAN. SO, IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. WE GOTTA STOP PUTIN. [ LAUGHTER ] GOT TO STOP PUTIN.
SO THIS IS ALL A BIG STIRRED UP MESS THAT HAPPENED WHEN CONGRESS WAS OUT OF SESSION. SUDDENLY THE PRESIDENT IS BOOTED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: GREAT JOB, ARTHUR. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT DANCE THAT IS. BUT BILLY DEE WILLIAMS SHOULD DEFINITELY STEAL THAT FOR HIS NEXT MOVE. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS JUST WEIRD. THIS WEEK BELGIUM WANTED TO GIVE THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BRUSSELS A GIFT. THEY WANT TO GIVE A GIFT TO COMMEMORATE OBAMA'S VISIT. THIS IS REAL. THIS IS A GIFT. THEY DECIDED ON A LIFE SIZE COOKIE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA WEARING A USA SWEATSHIRT, AND HOLDING A BASKETBALL. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK AT THIS THING. THIS IS REAL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FRANCE GIVES US THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. BELGIUM GIVES US THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT GOT EVEN WEIRDER WHEN BIDEN SPENT A HALF HOUR TALKING TO IT. HE'S LIKE, "YOU SEEM QUIET TODAY. EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] HE SEEMS FLATTER." SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS. I HEARD THAT KENTUCKY SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL'S NEW CAMPAIGN AD MISTAKENLY FEATURES A CLIP OF DUKE'S BASKETBALL TEAM CELEBRATING A WIN, INSTEAD OF THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY. BIG MISTAKE. I SAW ANOTHER ONE OF HIS ADS. SEEM LIKE THERE WERE A BUNCH OF MISTAKES. JUST TAKE A LOOK. SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANY OF THEM.
HI, I'M MITCH McCONNELL AND I LOVE KENTUCKY. I ALSO LOVE WORKING HERE, IN THE U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING. I'LL STAND UP TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. FOR I'M MITCH McCONNELL, AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: MAYBE JUST HIS VOICE IS OFF OR SOMETHING. SOMETHING'S WRONG -- GET THIS. TODAY, POPE FRANCIS HAD TO FIRE A GERMAN BISHOP KNOWN AS THE "BLING BISHOP" AFTER HE SPENT OVER $43 MILLION RENOVATING HIS HOUSE. ALTHOUGH POPE FRANCIS WAS NICE ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE IT AS A A "CONSCIOUS UNBISHOPING." [ LLIGHT LAUGHTER ] HUGE TECH STORY. FACEBOOK HAS ACQUIRED THE VIRTUAL REALITY COMPANY OCULUS VR FOR $2 BILLION.

[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR TWO DAYS." AND FINALLY, A GROWING NUMBER OF OLDER AMERICANS SAY THEY ARE CHOOSING NOT TO RETIRE BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY WOULD GET TOO BORED. WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN THINGS WHEN YOUR WATIRESS AT HOOTERS SAYS, "HEY, MY EYES ARE UP HERE, NOT DOWN HERE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY EYES ARE UP HERE. NOT DOWN HERE." WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW.

Jimmy: EVERYONE, PLEASE WELCOME JOBY OGWYN, RIGHT HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: THAT IS TOTALLY INSANE. THESE DON'T LOOK LIKE THE SAME SUITS. MINE'S TOO TIGHT OR SOMETHING, RIGHT?
ACTUALLY, IT FITS YOU JUST RIGHT.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
A LITTLE TIGHT FIT IS BETTER.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: SO WHY ARE YOU GOING BAGGY? ARE YOU JUST, LIKE, STREET? [ LAUGHTER ]
THIS THING ACTUALLY BLOWS UP AND GETS A LOT BIGGER IN THE AIR.
Jimmy: IT DOES?
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU JUST WATCHED THERE.
Jimmy: I MEAN, THIS IS -- SO YOU'LL BE WEARING THIS EXACT SUIT OR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT?
THIS EXACT SUIT.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE ONE YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR WHEN YOU DO THIS? NOW, THIS IS -- HOW WOULD YOU TRAIN FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS?
WELL, YOU CAN TRAIN BY JUMPING OUT OF AIRPLANES TO TEST THE SUIT. WHICH IS -- SOUNDS A LITTLE MORE LIKE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. BUT THEN WE GO TO JUMPING OFF MOUNTAINS AFTER THAT.
Jimmy: GOSH. I MEAN, SO WHAT -- WHEN DO YOU -- YOU SAID IN MAY. YOU WON'T GIVE A SPECIFIC DATE.
IT'S ALL WEATHER DEPENDENT. WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR A REALLY PERFECT WINDOW OF WEATHER. AND WE GET IT CONSISTENTLY EVERY MAY. CLIMBERS ARE ABLE TO GET TO THE TOP. SO IF WE CAN GET TO THE TOP, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUMP.
Jimmy: AND HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET TO THE TOP?
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE US FIVE TO SIX WEEKS OF TOTAL TIME BEING THERE AND ABOUT THREE OR FOUR DAYS TO CLIMB UP.
Jimmy: CAN'T YOU JUST FLY THERE? [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO THE ALTITUDE. SO I CAN GO UP REALLY SLOW. I HAVE TO. BUT COMING DOWN, THAT'S GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT STORY. IT'LL BE SUPER FAST.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR BODY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON? I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST --
MY BODY DOESN'T KNOW HALF THE TIME ANYWAY.
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW. BUT I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING DOWN AND YOU'RE CHANGING ALTITUDES. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
IF YOU GO DOWN FAST, THAT'S OKAY. YOU JUST CAN'T GO UP FAST.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
SO THE FASTER I GO DOWN, THE BETTER I'LL FEEL.
Jimmy: DO YOU HAVE AN OXYGEN TANK?
I'LL TAKE ONE TO GET TO THE TOP. BUT THEN WHEN I GET TO THE TOP, BUT THEN WHEN I GET TO THE TOP, I'LL TAKE IT OFF. AND THEN I'LL JUST GO INTO MY FLIGHT SUIT AND JUMP DOWN.
Jimmy: MY GOD, THIS IS INSANE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE GOING TO TEACH ME HOW TO FLY RIGHT NOW, RIGHT?
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: I'M VERY EXCITED FOR THIS. SO IT'LL BE SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU EXPERIENCE?
OH YEAH.
Jimmy: LET'S CHECK THIS OUT.
OKAY.
Jimmy: I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW, GO RIGHT HERE. I'M GOING TO PUT A COUPLE OF THESE THINGS ON.
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: HOW FAST ARE YOU GOING WHEN YOU JUMP OFF? DO YOU KNOW?
BECAUSE THE ALTITUDE IS SO HIGH AND THE AIR IS SO THIN, IT'LL PROBABLY BE FASTER THAN NORMAL. IT'D USUALLY BE MAYBE 120, 130. WE MIGHT BE CLOSE TO 200 AS I COME DOWN.
Jimmy: 200 MILES PER HOUR?
YEAH.
Jimmy: WOW. ALL RIGHT, READY? I THINK I'M READY TO FLY. RIGHT? LET'S JUST GO. 1, 2, 3, LIFT OFF. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOW'D I DO? LIKE THAT?
