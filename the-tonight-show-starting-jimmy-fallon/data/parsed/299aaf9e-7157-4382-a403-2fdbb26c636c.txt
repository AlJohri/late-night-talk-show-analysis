I JUST -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS." NOW ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES THAT WAS EXPECTED TO COME UP WAS IMMIGRATION. I SAW THAT FORMER IRANIAN PRESIDENT MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD RECENTLY WROTE A 3,500 WORD LETTER TO TRUMP CRITICIZING HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY. WHEN ASKED IF HE READ THE LETTER, TRUMP SAID, "I HAVEN'T EVEN READ MY IMMIGRATION POLICY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHY WOULD I READ THAT? I HAVE TO FINISH -- WORDS. JUST GIVE ME A MULLIGAN ON THAT ONE." [ LAUGHTER ] LISTEN TO THIS, I SAW THAT TRUMP'S NEW COMMERCE SECRETARY IS THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF A BANK THAT'S OWNED BY VLADIMIR PUTIN.
