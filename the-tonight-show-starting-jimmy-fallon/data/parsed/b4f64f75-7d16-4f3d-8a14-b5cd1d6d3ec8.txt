Questlove: 527!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! NOW, THAT IS A HOT CROWD! THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE RIGHT THERE. GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD! WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW"! THIS IS IT, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE AT THE SHOW YOU WANT TO BE AT! OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU GUYS TONIGHT. LET'S GET TO THE NEWS FIRST. THIS IS PRETTY BIG. YESTERDAY, IN CHINA, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD A MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. AND, BEFORE THEY STARTED, OBAMA TEXTED MICHELLE GOING INTO A A MEETING, "LOVE YOU." WHILE PUTIN TEXTED THE SAME THING TO DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ISN'T THAT WEIRD?
Steve: WOW. [ RUSSIAN ACCENT ]
Jimmy: LOVE YOU, KISSY FACE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, A PHOTO OF OBAMA GREETING PUTIN IS GOING VIRAL, BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE GIVING EACH OTHER THE DEATH STARE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PHOTO. LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] I FEEL LIKE BOTH GUYS WERE JUST THINKING, "OOF, HE'S GOTTEN OLD." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK MAYBE THAT PHOTO MIGHT JUST NEED A LITTLE MUSIC. CAN WE LOOK AT IT AGAIN? ♪ LET'S GET IT ON ♪ [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ LET'S GET IT ON ♪ ♪♪ [ RUSSIAN ACCENT ] ARE YOU AS TURNED ON AS I AM? [ LAUGHTER ] LOVE YOU, KISSY FACE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SAYING PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS SNUBBED BY CHINA WHEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE STAIRS READY FOR HIM TO GET OFF THE PLANE. IN FACT, DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT IF THAT EVER HAPPENED TO HIM, HE'D JUST CLOSE THE PLANE DOORS AND LEAVE THE COUNTRY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN EVERY OTHER COUNTRY WAS LIKE, "THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TO DO? THANK YOU. THAT'S PERFECT!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "DON'T PUT UP THE STAIRS! DON'T GIVE HIM ANY STAIRS!" AND THIS WAS EVERYWHERE OVER THE WEEKEND. DONALD TRUMP'S SON, DON JR., TWEETED A PHOTO OF HIMSELF WITH HIS SISTER, IVANKA, AND BROTHER, ERIC, TO REACH OUT TO THE MILLENNIAL VOTERS. BUT I'M NOT SURE IT CAME OFF AS FRIENDLY AS THEY'D HOPE. TAKE A LOOK AT THE PHOTO. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, SINCE THE PICTURE WAS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT MILLENNIAL VOTERS, WE ACTUALLY ASKED SOME YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT THEY THOUGHT. HERE'S WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. THIS FIRST GUY SAID, "THAT FAMILY PHOTO MADE ME SMILE. IT'S A GOOD PICTURE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THESE -- THESE SISTERS SAID, "WE ENJOYED THIS PHOTO VERY MUCH." [ LAUGHTER ] "IT MADE US HAPPY. THIS PICTURE BROUGHT US JOY." AND, FINALLY, THIS GUY SAID, "THOSE KIDS LOOKS MESSED UP, MAN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MILLENNIAL -- NO SMILES, YEAH. OVER ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, I SAW THAT HILLARY CLINTON GOT A A NEW PLANE. AND SHE TOLD REPORTERS SHE'S SO HAPPY TO FINALLY HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THEM TO TRAVEL WITH HER. THEN SHE THREW ON HER NOISE-CANCELLING HEADPHONES AND A TWO SLEEP MASKS AND SAID, "TALK TO YOU NEVER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT, SOME PEOPLE NOTICED THAT BEING A PASSENGER ON HILLARY'S PLANE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN A COMMERCIAL FLIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE, JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE SAFETY CARD. IF SOMEONE TRIES TO GIVE YOU A A FULL BODY PAT DOWN, THAT'S JUST BILL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST GO WITH IT. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: CLINTON.
Jimmy: IF YOU FEEL SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: YOU'VE GOT TO GET MILLENNIALS. YOU GOT TO GET MILLENNIALS ON YOUR SIDE.
Steve: GOTTA GET 'EM ON BOARD.
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, HILLARY'S RUNNING MATE, TIM KANE POSTED A A PHOTO ON TWITTER OF HIM AND JOE BIDEN POSING WITH SUNGLASSES ON AND WROTE, "STRONGER TOGETHER." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT TURNS OUT BIDEN POSTED THAT SAME PHOTO TO HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT, AND HE WROTE, "ABOUT THE SHUT DOWN THE BAR AT APPLEBEES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] #DATVPLIFE" OH, I WANT TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR, CHRIS CHRISTIE. THAT'S RIGHT.

BED SEVEN IS SOMETHING I INVENTED. IT'S WHEN YOU FEEL KIND OF STRESSED OUT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
LIKE, THIS SUMMER I WAS DOING, LIKE, SEATTLE FILM FESTIVAL, NANTUCKET FILM FESTIVAL, PROMOTING THE MOVIE, BUSY WITH THE KIDS, HOSTING CAMPS, DRIVING, AND I REMEMBER GETTING TO SEATTLE, AND I WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOD, I NEED A BED SEVEN. AND I ALWAYS TELL MAKEUP ARTISTS AND HAIR STYLISTS THAT I'M WORKING WITH, I'M LIKE "I DO BED SEVEN." THEY'RE LIKE WHAT'S BED SEVEN? THEY TREAT IT LIKE IT'S LIKE A A REAL THING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BECAUSE I RECENTLY MADE IT LIKE IT'S KIND OF A JOKE. BUT BED SEVEN IS WHERE YOU TAKE YOUR BED --
Jimmy: YEAH.
FOR SEVEN HOURS.
Jimmy: UH HUH.
AND WHEN YOU'RE FEELING KIND OF TIRED OR JUST LIKE YOU NEED A BREAK, AND --
Jimmy: SLEEPING?
IT'S NOT SLEEPING.
Jimmy: IS IT TOTALLY --
NO NO. IT'S BASICALLY LIKE SAYING YOU WERE -- BECAUSE I'M A BUSY MOM, I DO IT USUALLY IF I'M TRAVELING FOR WORK, I'LL DO A BED SEVEN. I DID ONE IN SEATTLE.
Jimmy: THE NAME IS GREAT.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THOUGH.
SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOU COULD GO TO YOUR HOTEL ROOM, AND YOU COULD -- YOU COULD ORDER ROOM SERVICE, LIKE YOU COULD ORDER A CHEESE BURGER.
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND YOU SIT IN YOUR BED, AND YOU COULD EAT A BURGER, SIDE OF MAYO, FRENCH FRIES, AND YOU RELAX, NO TALKING ON THE PHONE. YOU CAN WATCH TV. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS RULE IS GOOD. YOU CAN WATCH TV.
YOU CAN TEXT. YOU CAN TEXT. YOU CAN READ.
Jimmy: WHY CAN'T YOU TALK? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU MADE YOUR OWN RULES, BUT YOU CAN'T TALK ON THE PHONE. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, NO.
THERE ARE A LOT OF RULES. NO. BECAUSE TALKING IS TOO MUCH ENERGY, AND SO IT'S A TIME TO QUIET DOWN, TUCK YOURSELF IN BED.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND JUST RELAX AND YOU WILL FEEL THE PRESSURE MELT AWAY.
Jimmy: FOR SEVEN HOURS?
SEVEN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S IT. IT'S SWEEPING THE NATION.
BED SEVEN.
Jimmy: #BEDSEVEN, YOU GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
BUT, MY FAVORITE THING IS TO ORDER A CHEESEBURGER IN BED DURING BED SEVEN. THAT'S MY NUMBER ONE MEAL.
Jimmy: THAT'S ONE THING WHEN YOU'RE -- WHEN YOU'RE DOING BED SEVEN BECAUSE I'VE MADE -- I MIGHT WANT TO GO FOR, LIKE, A A PASTA BOLOGNESE OR SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ] IT DEPENDS, YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT BED SEVENS, YOU KNOW. DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES.
OKAY, OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE COULD PUT OUT. WE'LL WORK ON THE BOOK. PAL I'M JUST SO EXCITED FOR YOU.
THANK YOU, JIMMY.
Jimmy: THIS FILM WAS WRITTEN BY CHRIS KELLY.
CHRIS KELLY HE'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: I KNOW HIM A LITTLE BIT FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."
YEAH AND HE JUST BECAME THE HEAD WRITER AT "SNL,"
Jimmy: THAT'S NICE.
SO HE YES, HE WROTE THE MOVIE, AND IT'S -- IT'S SEMIAUTOBIOGRAPHICAL BASED ON HIS FAMILY, AND IT'S ABOUT A A STRUGGLING COMEDY WRITER WHO MOVES HOME TO TAKE CARE OF HIS DYING MOM WHO GETS CANCER. AND IT'S FUNNY, AND IT TALKS ABOUT THE FUNNY PARTS OF THAT AND THE SAD PARTS AND KIND OF HOW THE FAMILY DEALS WITH IT.
Jimmy: THE FIRST SCENE, I MEAN I'M NOT GOING TO RUIN ANYTHING THERE BUT THE FAMILY'S CRYING. BECAUSE EVERYONE IN THE CAST IS FANTASTIC. JESSE PLEMONS.
JESSE PLEMONS, BRADLEY WHITFORD, MAUDE APATOW, MADISEN BEATY, J.J. TOTAH OH, MY GOSH.
Jimmy: EVERYONE'S GREAT. AND THEY'RE ALL KIND OF GRIEVING. I MEAN YOU'RE -- YOU'VE PASSED ON, AND THEY'RE JUST CRYING, AND THE PHONE RINGS, AND NO ONE'S GOING TO GET IT BECAUSE THEY ARE CRYING.
MHM.
Jimmy: IT'S A REALLY DEEP MOMENT, AND THEN IT GOES TO VOICE MAIL, WHICH YOU HEAR YOUR VOICE, AND YOU GO OH THAT'S REALLY SAD BUT THEN THE PERSON'S LIKE, "HI, IT'S BARB, JUST I HEARD YOU'RE SICK, AND," LIKE, THIS IS, LIKE, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN LIKE REAL LIFE, AND SHE'S LIKE, "YEAH, WELL, ANYWAY, IF YOU GET A CHANCE, CALL ME BACK." AND THEN SHE STARTS ORDERING THROUGH A DRIVE-THRU TAKEOUT, AND IT'S LIKE "I SAID ONE MILKSHAKE AND TWO IS." AND EVERYONE'S TRYING TO GRIEVE. BUT STILL THEY'RE HEARING THIS RIDICULOUS MESSAGE. AND I GO, THAT'S PERFECT. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT LIFE -- THERE'S NO RULES. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.
I KNOW. AND FUNNY THINGS HAPPEN DURING THOSE SAD TIMES TOO. CHRIS CAPTURED IT SO WELL.
Jimmy: BUT YOU, REALLY, MOLLY, EVERYONE KNOWS YOU, KNOWS THAT YOU ARE SUCH A GOOD ACTOR. I THINK YOU ARE VERY -- YOU'RE A GREAT, DRAMATIC ACTOR, AND I KNOW YOU OBVIOUSLY AS THE FUNNIEST PERSON, BUT ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE," WE ALL KNEW THAT YOU'RE A GREAT ACTOR. LORNE, AND WILL, YOU GUYS WOULD DO BITS, YOU AND WILL FERREL. AND SOMETIMES JUST THE SCENES WOULD JUST THEY'D JUST GO TO A A DRAMATIC TURN AND JUST SEE HOW STRAIGHT WE CAN DO THINGS.
OH YEAH.
Jimmy: AND I WOULD JUST LOVE DOING THAT WITH YOU, WHENEVER WE'D PLAY STORE OR SOMETHING, I STILL LOVE THAT.
YES, I KNOW.
Jimmy: IT WAS NO FUN. IT WASN'T A JOKE. WE'D PLAY A GAME CALLED "STORE" WHERE YOU JUST HAVE TO PRETEND TO WALK INTO A STORE, BUY SOMETHING, AND PAY FOR IT, AND LEAVE.
YEAH THAT WAS IT.
Jimmy: BUT THAT WAS IT.
AND YOU WOULD JUST, DO LIKE, YOU KNOW GET THE THING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND JUST BE LIKE LET ME JUST GET A PRICE CHECK ON THAT, AND TYPE IT IN, AND YOU DO IT WITH NO ACTING AT ALL. JUST REALLY -- THERE WAS WATER --
Jimmy: I'M SORRY WATER JUST SPILLED EVERYWHERE. BUT WE WOULD DO THAT AT LIKE 3:00 IN THE MORNING TO THINK OF IDEAS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT STUFF. I JUST, I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU, THIS MOVIE WAS MADE FOR YOU. YOU HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK.
GOD JIMMY! THAT'S SUCH A COMPLIMENT.
Jimmy: EVERY SCENE, IT'S NOT TOO MUCH, IT'S NOT TOO LITTLE, IT'S LIKE, MOLLY, JUST OWNING EVERY SINGLE THING. IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU WROTE THIS FOR YOURSELF. AND I'M JUST SO HAPPY THAT YOU GOT TO STRETCH AND DO THIS BECAUSE, MAN, OH, MAN, IT'S SO WORTH IT. YOU ARE JUST FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU, JIMMY!
Jimmy: I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT.
PHEW. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: IT'S GREAT. YOU'VE GOTTA SEE HER PERFORMANCE. YOU'LL LAUGH, YOU'LL CRY, YOU FEEL FOR YOU, YOU ARE SO SMART, IT'S JUST SO, SO GOOD.
I HAVE TO SAY THAT MEANS SO MUCH COMING FROM YOU BECAUSE I USED TO PERFORM JUST TO MAKE YOU LAUGH WHEN I WAS ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE," LIKE THE CHARACTER, I DID JEANNIE DARCY, WHO WAS A BAD STANDUP COMIC, IT WAS REALLY ALMOST MADE AND CREATED EXCLUSIVELY FOR JIMMY FALLON BECAUSE YOU'D COME OUT AND WATCH IT, AND ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS MAKE JIMMY LAUGH.
Jimmy: OH.
AND THE AUDIENCE WOULD BE KIND OF, LIKE, WHAT IS THIS, BUT JIMMY WAS LIKE -- AND SO --
Jimmy: THAT'S STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS. THANK YOU.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT.
SO COMING FROM YOU, THAT'S A A HUGE COMPLIMENT.
Jimmy: OH PLEASE.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THIS ONE JUST MAN IT MADE ME CRY, IT WAS JUST SO FANTASTIC. AND LAUGH, IT'S INCRE --
