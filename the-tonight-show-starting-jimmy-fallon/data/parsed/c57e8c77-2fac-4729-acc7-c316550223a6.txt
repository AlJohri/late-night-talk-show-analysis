Jimmy: FANTASTIC. HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN A WHILE. CONGRATS ON THE NEW BOOK.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THIS IS AWESOME. IT'S FUN.
YEAH, THAT WAS ME. IT'S ALL ABOUT ME FROM 1995 TO 1999.
Jimmy: YEAH.
ADDICTED TO FILMS.
Jimmy: WHAT GOT YOU INTO IT? LIKE, YOU WANTED TO GO SEE AS MANY FILMS AS YOU POSSIBLY COULD?
YEAH, BACK IN L.A. I JUST GOT SUCKED INTO GOING TO PLACES LIKE THE NEW BEVERLY AND THE NEW ART, AND PLACES LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: AW, I LOVE THE NEW ART.
I REMEMBER, ACTUALLY, I THINK I MET YOU THERE. I WAS WITH A FRIEND. I WAS LIKE, "HEY, THAT GUY, HE'S PRETTY CUTE, LIKE INTRODUCE ME." [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ AND SO THEN, YOU HAD ME OVER -- REMEMBER, YOU SAID, "LOOK, COME OVER AND WE'LL PLAY SOME VIDEO GAMES." I WENT TO YOUR APARTMENT. YOU LAID OUT LIKE -- IT WAS LIKE RITZ CRACKERS AND GOUDA CHEESE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I UPPED MY GAME A A LITTLE BIT. YEAH, YEAH. I UPPED MY GAME, YEAH. YEAH, WE DIDN'T HIT IT OFF.
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS LIKE, LOOK, MAYBE NICOLE KIDMAN WOULD FALL FOR THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I'M A LITTLE MORE --
Jimmy: NO ONE DID. NO ONE DID.
YOU BLEW IT. I'M TAKEN, MAN.
Jimmy: YEAH. SORRY ABOUT THAT, YEAH. I DO REMEMBER THAT.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. BUT IT'S GOOD, THIS IS -- IT'S A FILM THING, BUT IT'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF A MEMOIR, TOO, OF YOUR TIME IN L.A. AT THE TIME. BECAUSE YOU WERE A COMEDIAN. AND GOING OUT THERE AND YOU JUST STARTED. WERE YOU WRITING FOR "MAD TV"?
YEAH, I HAD JUST MOVED TO L.A. I HAD GOTTEN A WRITING JOB ON "MAD TV." THEN, I WENT TO THIS PLACE CALLED THE NEW BEVERLY, WHICH IS STILL THERE, A LITTLE REP THEATER. AND I STARTED SEEING MOVIES. AND IN MY MIND I DID THAT THING OF, WELL, I BECAME A COMEDIAN BECAUSE I WATCHED A LOT OF COMEDIANS, AND THEN I WENT ON STAGE. SO IF I WANT BECOME A A DIRECTOR -- BECAUSE I WANTED TO WRITE MOVIES AND DIRECT THEM.  -- I'LL JUST START SEEING MOVIES. BECAUSE SCORSESE WATCHES MOVIES ALL THE TIME. ALL THE GREAT DIRECTORS JUST DEVOUR FILMS.
Jimmy: THEY LIVE AND BREATHE IT.
BUT WHAT I FORGOT WAS THAT AFTER THEY DEVOURED FILMS FOR A A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN STARTED MAKING THEM. I JUST GOT STUCK IN THE DEVOURING PHASE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU WERE JUST A DUDE WATCHING MOVIES.
THAT'S ALL I DID. AND I WAS BECOMING LIKE ONE OF THOSE -- YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THEM, BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME YOU WENT TO THE NEW ART A BUNCH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THESE PEOPLE, ALL THEY WOULD DO IS SEE MOVIES. IT WAS EVEN SCARY BECAUSE I GOT THIS THING WHERE, IF I SEE A A CLASSIC MOVIE THAT'S IN ONE OF THESE FIVE MOVIE BOOKS THAT I HAVE, THESE GUIDES, AND I CHECK IT OFF. THAT WILL MAKE ME HAVE A GOOD SET.
Jimmy: IT'S FANTASTIC. I LIKE THAT YOU EMBRACE THE NERDINESS OF IT ALL BECAUSE I ENJOY GOING TO SEE FILMS. AND I LOVE -- EVERYONE DOES IT, TOO. EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC. AND YOU GO, LIKE, "OH, I THOUGHT THE ENDING WAS WELL DONE." IT'S LIKE, REALLY? IT'S JUST A FUN MOVIE.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: BUT IF YOU GET TOO OBSESSED WITH IT, YOU GET INTO DEBATES WITH PEOPLE AND STUFF.
AND WELL, YOU GET -- SEE, THAT'S THE THING. I DIDN'T GET IN DEBATES WITH PEOPLE. I GOT INTO -- I WOULD TALK TO THEM JUST FOR AN HOUR IN PARAGRAPHS, AND WOULDN'T LET THEM GET A WORD IN EDGE-WISE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS DOUBLE FEATURE, THIS IS "SUNSET BOULEVARD" AND "THE ACE IN THE HOLE". NOW, "ACE IN THE HOLE" WAS HIS FOLLOW UP TO "SUNSET BOULEVARD". NOW, SUNSET BOULEVARD IS WEIRD BECAUSE HE WENT AND IT WAS JUST -- [ MAKING ENGINE NOISES ]
Jimmy: AS YOU'RE STILL TALKING.
AND I WOULD SEE THE KIND OF PERSON I COULD TURN INTO IF I DIDN'T PULL MYSELF -- YOU'D SEE THESE PEOPLE -- I REMEMBER ONE TIME I WENT TO THE NEW ART TO SEE "THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW".
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I SAW.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THE MIDNIGHT SHOWINGS.
WELL, THEY HAD THIS GROUP OF KIDS THAT CLEARLY THEY WOULD DO THE REGULAR SHOW. THEY WOULD GO THERE. THEY WOULD DRESS UP. AND THEN, THERE WAS THIS WEIRD GUY WHO LOOKED LIKE KIND OF JEFF BRIDGES IN "THE BIG LEBOWSKI", WHO HAD -- HE KIND OF UNDERSTOOD THE IDEA BUT NOT REALLY. AND HE WORE THIS ROBE, AND HE HAD A STAFF THAT HE COVERED IN CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. SO HE WOULD -- THEY WOULD DOING LIKE THE "TIME WARP" AND DANCING. AND HE WOULD JUST BE KIND OF OVER TO THE SIDE, JUST WAVING THIS STICK WITH LIGHTS ON IT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU COULD SEE -- LIKE "THE ROCKY HORROR" KIDS WERE LIKE, "LET'S NOT MAKE THIS GUY ANGRY BECAUSE HE'LL SKIN US AND MAKE US INTO BOX KITES." [ LAUGHTER ] SO THEY ALL LET HIM --
Jimmy: TURN THEM INTO BOX KITES?
YEAH. BUT, SO EVERY "ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW", FOR AWHILE AT THE NEW ART, WAS THIS GREAT GROUP OF KIDS --
Jimmy: WHO KNOW THE MOVIE.
YEAH, THIS WEIRD BEACH GUY JUST, AGHH! IN HIS MIND, "THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW" WAS A STICK COVERED IN CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AND YOU WAVE IT AROUND.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU DO AT ALL.
THAT'S THE ENTIRE MOVIE, SO --
Jimmy: IT'S A FANTASTIC BOOK. I WANT YOU TO CHECK IT OUT. BUT HERE'S ONE THING. THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU. AND JUST TELL ME IF I'M RIGHT ABOUT THIS. THERE IS PHOTO OF YOU IN THE BACK. YOU KNOW HOW AUTHOR'S ALWAYS HAVE A PICTURE OF THEM? CLEARLY, YOU DIDN'T SET UP A A PHOTO SHOOT.
NO, I DIDN'T. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS LOOKS LIKE YOU TOOK YOUR iPHONE OUT. YOUR PUBLISHER CALLED AND SAID, "DO YOU HAVE A PHOTO?" AND YOU TOOK A SELFIE, AND SAID, "HERE IT IS, GOODBYE."
THAT IS EXACTLY -- THE PUBLISHER CALLED AND SAID, "OH, MY GOD, WE FORGOT TO DO A A JACKET PHOTO. DO YOU WANT TO SET SOMETHING UP?" AND AS I WAS -- NO, I GOT THE E-MAIL, AND AS I WAS ANSWERING THE E-MAIL, I JUST WENT -- LIKE THAT. I DID THE TILT UP TO HIDE THE FAT NECK. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DO THAT. YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS TAKE THE PICTURE --
Jimmy: THAT'S VERY SMART. YOU'VE GOT TO DO THAT.
THEN, I E-MAILED IT IN. ALTHOUGH, I DID IT TOO MUCH BECAUSE NOW I LOOK LIKE AN 83-YEAR-OLD METH ADDICT IN THE PICTURE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S AWFUL.
Jimmy: A VERY TALENTED ONE AS WELL. I GOT TO SAY, YOU'RE ALSO ON TOUR. AND THIS IS A BIG DEAL. YOU'RE DOING CARNEGIE HALL NEXT WEEK.
