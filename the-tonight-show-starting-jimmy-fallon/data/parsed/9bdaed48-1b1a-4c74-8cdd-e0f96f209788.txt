[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS BEING HERE, BUT LET'S GET TO THE NEWS. TODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN MET WITH THE UKRANIAN PRIME MINISTER TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT. THAT'S NICE. THE PRIME MINISTER SAID, "YOU GUYS SHOULD VISIT UKRAINE SOMETIME." [ LAUGHTER ] OBAMA SAID, "BIDEN WOULD LOVE TO." [ LAUGHTER ] BIDEN WAS LIKE, "WHAT? I WAS WATCHING THE DOOR. WHAT'S GOING ON?" PAY ATTENTION. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU KNOW WHO'S NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS IS RUSSIA. IT HAS BEEN VERY TENSE BETWEEN US RECENTLY. IN FACT, LAWMAKERS IN RUSSIA HAVE STARTED A PETITION TO GET THE U.S. KICKED OUT OF THIS YEAR'S WORLD CUP. [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
