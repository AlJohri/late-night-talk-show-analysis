HOT CROWD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO THE SHOW. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, LeBRON JAMES. TODAY HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL, IN FACT, BE RETURNING TO THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS FOUR YEARS AFTER HE LEFT THE TEAM. THAT'S RIGHT. HE'S COMING HOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S COMING HOME, WHICH GOT WEIRD WHEN HE FOUND OUT THAT HIS MOM HAD ALL READY TURNED HIS OLD BEDROOM INTO AN EXERCISE ROOM. MOM, I WAS JUST -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNEW I WAS COMING BACK. THAT'S RIGHT, LeBRON IS GOING BACK TO CLEVELAND. OR AS CLEVELAND FANS PUT IT, IS THERE ANY WAY TO UN-BURN JERSEYS? [ LAUGHTER ] WE HATE -- WE LOVE HIM! THE MIAMI HEAT'S OWNER, MICKY ARISON, HE ALSO OWNS CARNIVAL CRUISES. HE SAID TODAY THAT HE WAS SHOCKED AND DISAPPOINTED BY LeBRON'S DECISION. I THINK IT WILL BE OKAY. I MEAN, IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO'S USED TO DEALING WITH A SINKING SHIP -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND FOOD POISONING. COME FOR THE FOOD POISONING. STAY FOR THE DIARRHEA.
Steve: BLEH!

Jimmy: DID YOU HOLD YOUR OWN?

YES. ALBERT AND I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. YOU KNOW, IT WAS FIRST -- YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GET IN A CLASS AND EVERYBODY, THEY CALL OUT PEOPLE'S NAMES AND THEY SAY HERE, HERE AND THEY CALLED OUT MY NAME AND I SAID "HERE." AND THEN AFTER CLASS ALBERT SAID TO ME, ARE YOU -- "DO YOU KNOW CARL REINER?" AND I SAID, WELL, YEAH. HE SAYS WELL, "I KNOW CARL REINER," HE SAYS TO ME. I SAID "REALLY? I SAID, WELL, HE'S MY DAD." AND HE SAYS "OH."
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW --
I DON'T KNOW HIM THAT WELL. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW HIM A LITTLE BETTER THAN ME.
Jimmy: WAS HE A FUNNY KID?
OH HE WAS FUNNY. HE WAS -- AT 16 YEARS OLD, HE WAS LIKE A PRODIGY. HE COULD MAKE ADULTS LAUGH. HE MADE MY DAD LAUGH. I REMEMBER ONE TIME HE WAS AT THE HOUSE, HE DID A ROUTINE WHERE HE WAS THE GREATEST ESCAPE ARTIST OF ALL TIME. AND BASICALLY WHAT HE DID WAS, HE SAID "HERE, TIE MY HANDS." AND HE PUT A NAPKIN DRAPED OVER HIS HAND AND THEN NEVER TIED IT. HE SAID "OKAY, THEN PUT A A TISSUE IN MY MOUTH." HE PUT THE TISSUE AND THEN HE JUST WALKED BEHIND THE DRAPE. AND THAT WAS IT. FROM BEHIND THE DRAPE, YOU HEARD "I CAN'T GET OUT. I CAN'T BREATHE." [ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN HE FALLS OUT OF THE DRAPE. MY DAD WAS, LIKE, DONE.
Jimmy: I CAN'T BREATHE! OF COURSE HE'S ONE OF THE BEST COMEDIANS EVER. I'VE HEARD SO MANY FUNNTY STORIES ABOUT ALBERT BROOKS. HOW HE'S SO INTO COMEDY AND JOKES THAT ONE TIME, HE'S AT A A PARTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
OH, GEES, YEAH, NO, LISTEN. WHEN ALBERT BROOKS, I MEAN, ALBERT BROOKS IS A GENIUS. HE'S THE MOST BRILLIANT COMEDIAN I KNOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND YOU'D BE IN A ROOM WITH, YOU KNOW, BILLY CRYSTAL AND ROBIN WILLIAMS. WHOEVER IT WAS. WHEN ALBERT WOULD START, EVERYBODY CLEARED THE FLOOR AND THEY WOULD LET HIM GO. BECAUSE IT WAS, LIKE, GENIUS. AND ONE TIME AT A PARTY, HE GOES AND EVERYBODY IS HYSTERICAL LAUGHING. HE FINISHES AND THEN HE CAN'T STAY AT THE PARTY. HE HAS TO LEAVE BECAUSE HE'S DONE. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE, ALL RIGHT SO GREAT BIT, I CAN'T TOP THAT, AND HE LEAVES. ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER, THE HOSTESS OF THE PARTY CALLS ME UP AND SAYS THERE'S A TELEPHONE CALL FOR YOU, ALBERT'S ON THE PHONE. SO I GET ON THE PHONE AND I SAID ALBERT -- THIS WAS A LONG TIME AGO, THIS WAS BEFORE CELLPHONES ARE ANYTHING. I SAID, "ALBERT, WHAT'S UP?" HE SAID, "LISTEN, ROB, YOU'VE GOT TO DO ME A BIG FAVOR." I SAID "WHAT?" HE SAID "I LEFT MY KEYS IN THE HOUSE THERE. CAN YOU GET THEM AND COME OUTSIDE?" HE'D BEEN WALKING AROUND FOR 20 MINUTES, HE COULDN'T COME BACK IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE HE WAS FINISHED.

Jimmy: SO FREE AND FUN AND HILARIOUS.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: AND THIS MOVIE IS BASED ON SOMETHING THAT JACK NICHOLSON SAID DURING A A PRESS JUNKET?
YES. WE'RE DOING A PRESS JUNKET FOR "BUCKET LIST" AND EVERY JOUNALIST WOULD ASK "WHAT'S ON YOUR BUCKET LIST?" AND WHENEVER THEY ASKED JACK NICHOLSON THAT QUESTION, HE'D SAY "ONE MORE GREAT ROMANCE." I THOUGHT "HEY, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA." THAT BECAME THE IDEA FOR "AND SO IT GOES." IT'S ABOUT TWO PEOPLE FINDING EACH OTHER LATER ON IN LIFE. AND WE PROVED THAT THERE'S AN AUDIENCE OUT THERE FOR MOVIES OF THAT AGE. I MEAN, LOOK. WE'RE SUCCESSFUL WITH "BUCKET LIST." AND, YOU KNOW, WE MADE THE JOKE THAT OF OUR CORE DEMOGRAPHIC, WE HAD 100% DESIRE TO SEE WITH A 40% ABILITY TO GET TO THE THEATER.

I'M VERY PROUD THAT IT'S 90 MINUTES LONG. BECAUSE, LOOK -- I DON'T ANYBODY OUT THERE THAT'S MY AGE, BUT WE GO TO THE BATHROOM A LOT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO. YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM RIGHT BEFORE. 90 MINUTES, YOU CAN GO RIGHT AFTER. [ APPLAUSE ]

NEW YORK, HOW ARE YOU FEELING? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, MY GOD. THIS IS SO COOL. THANK YOU, BRO. BROUGHT MY COUSINS. [ BLEEP ] [ BLEEP ] [ LAUGHTER ] SO THIS IS SO COOL, MAN. YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] SORRY, JUST TO MESS WITH THE PRODUCERS. HE'S DOING THE TELEMUNDO THING. THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK. THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK. JIMMY, TALK TO HIM. ONE THING ABOUT JIMMY, YOU GUYS, I'VE NOTICED OVER THE YEARS IS THAT DESPITE ALL THE DIFFERENT HOSTS THAT THERE'S BEEN OF "THE TONIGHT SHOW," NO HOST HAS EVER DRIVEN WOMEN CRAZY LIKE JIMMY FALLON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S INSANE. THAT'S INSANE. I'M CHECKING IN EARLIER AND THEY'RE LIKE, "OH MY GOD, ARE YOU GONNA MEET HIM?" AND THEN THEY HUGGED ME SO I COULD HUG YOU FOR THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S AN AMAZING POWER. I WISH I COULD DO THAT. HE IS SO HOT. NO, SERIOUSLY, JIMMY, YOU'RE A A BEAUTIFUL MAN. YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL MAN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT IS NO JOKE. THAT IS NO JOKE ABOUT THAT. TRUST ME. I KEEP SAYING YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. I'M NOT GAY, BUT IF WE WERE IN PRISON, HELL, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] HYPOTHETICAL. NEVER HAPPEN, JIMMY.
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT'S ALSO COOL? THE DEMOGRAPHICS. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU BRING IN SUCH A YOUNGER AUDIENCE. MY SON, MY SON IS 16 YEARS OLD AND HE WATCHES "THE TONIGHT SHOW." HE DOESN'T STAY UP LATE TO WATCH IT, BUT HE WATCHES IT ON HIS "TONIGHT SHOW" APP OR WHATEVER. HE'LL SIT THERE AND HE'S STARTS LAUGHING, AND -- THIS KILLS ME, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA TELL YOU THIS. HE GETS THESE HEADPHONES THAT I GOT HIM FOR CHRISTMAS A WHILE BACK, RIGHT? AND THEY'RE THOSE ONES WITH NOISE REDUCTION AND YOU HIT THAT NOISE REDUCTION AND HE CANNOT HEAR HIMSELF WHEN HE'S LAUGHING. SO I'M IN THE OTHER ROOM AND I HEAR THIS -- AH! AH, AH, AH! [ LAUGHTER ] I WALK OUT AND I'M, LIKE, "DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" AH! WHATEVER. AND THEN HE GETS UPSET BECAUSE I DISCONNECT THE WIFI. I'M LIKE, "I'M SORRY, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE BABY SEAL," YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A DIFFERENT TIME NOW. IT'S LIKE HE COMPLAINS. THE WIFI, I CAN'T MAKE A CALL, I CAN'T MAKE A CALL. DUDE, YOU'VE GOT A CELL PHONE. I DIDN'T HAVE A PHONE WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE. YOUR MOM DIDN'T HAVE A PHONE. IF WE WANTED TO MAKE A CALL, WE HAD TO CARRY CHANGE OR WE HAD TO CALL COLLECT. AND HE LOOKS AT ME, "WHAT'S THAT?" I'M LIKE "OH, MY GOD." [ LAUGHTER ] HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. HE'LL NEVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT. HE'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE OUT LATE AT NIGHT SOMEWHERE AND HAVE TO USE ONE OF THOSE NASTY PAY PHONES. FIRST OF ALL, TO FIND ONE. EVERY TIME YOU SEE A PAY PHONE, YOU'RE, LIKE, "OH MY GOSH, TAKE A PICTURE. THEY'RE ABOUT TO TAKE IT DOWN." [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S NEVER GOING TO KNOW ABOUT THAT. ABOUT BEING OUT LATE AT NIGHT HAVING TO PICK UP THAT NASTY RECEIVER THAT'S GOT GUM AND GONORRHEA ALL OVER IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT FAR FROM AWAY YOUR FACE SO YOU DON'T GET INFECTED AND STICKY. BACK IN THE DAY, WHEN YOU MADE A COLLECT CALL, IT WAS A A MISSION. AND IT WAS EXPENSIVE. IF YOU CALLED MY MOM COLLECT LIKE IF YOU CALLED MY MOM COLLECT BACK IN THE DAY, OH MY GOSH, IT BETTER HAVE BEEN LIFE OR DEATH OR THAT'S WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE. YOU NOW, YOU'D CALL HER UP -- SHE'D PICK UP -- HELLO? BUENO? AND THEN SHE'D GET THE PRESENTATION. AT&T, DO YOU ACCEPT A COLLECT CALL FROM -- CALLER, AT THE TONE, SAY ONLY YOUR NAME. AND YOU HAD TO GET CREATIVE. [ BEEP ] MOM, IT'S ME, PICK ME UP, HURRY. I LOVE YOU, BYE. [ BEEP ] DO YOU ACCEPT THE CHARGES? HELL, NO, I'M ON MY WAY. [ APPLAUSE ] I'M TELLING YOU GUYS. IT WAS A MISSION. AND, SEE, MY SON, I LOVE HIM TO DEATH, AND I KNOW HE'S WATCHING. FRANKIE, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, BUT YOU GIVE ME A LOT OF GREAT MATERIAL, YOU REALLY DO. YOU KNOW, HE'S AT THE POINT NOW WHERE HE'S TOO OLD FOR ME TO REALLY, REALLY SCOLD HIM AND STUFF. SO, THE WAY I MESS WITH HIM IS VERY SIMPLE. I FOUND OUT THAT HE'S VERY BOTHERED BY AFFECTION. NOT NECESSARILY FROM ME. IF I HUG HIM, HE'S COOL WITH THAT, 'CAUSE I GIVE HIM THIS QUICK BRO HUG. LIKE, WHAT'S UP. YOU KNOW, IT'S COOL. HOWEVER, IF I'M STANDING NEXT TO HIS MOM AND I REACH OVER AND GRAB HER HAND, HE SEES THAT AS GROSS, YOU KNOW. AND IT'S FUNNY. I'LL GRAB HER HAND AND HE'S LIKE, AH! WHAT? AH! OH, THE HAND? YEAH, DAD, THAT'S GROSS. I GO, "FRANKIE, THAT'S NOT GROSS. BABY, OPEN YOUR MOUTH." AH! [ LAUGHTER ] AND I TAKE IT THERE EVERY SINGLE TIME, YOU GUYS. IT'S THE BEST. LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW MANY PARENTS ARE IN THE HOUSE? A LOT OF PARENTS IN THE HOUSE? YEAH? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT, SO AS PARENTS, WE EXPECT OUR KIDS TO GO TO SLEEP BY A CERTAIN TIME. OKAY, MY SON'S CUTOFF IS 11:00 P.M. WHICH IS PRETTY GENEROUS, CONSIDERING THE TIMES. EVERY NOW AND THEN, HE'LL PUSH THE ENVELOPE. AND I GET IT, WE ALL USED TO DO IT. WE PLAY DUMB, "OH, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS." BUT IT'S DIFFERENT NOW. HE'S HOLDING A CELLPHONE, I'M LIKE, "HELLO, IT'S A CLOCK." [ LAUGHTER ] HE'LL GO IN HIS ROOM HE'S LIKE, "GOOD NIGHT, DAD." AND HE'LL CLOSE THE DOOR. AND BASICALLY, WHAT HE DOES IS HE'LL GET A TOWEL. AND HE'LL TAKE THIS TOWEL AND HE'LL ROLL IT UP AND PUT IT UNDER THE DOOR SO I WON'T SEE THE LIGHT COMING FROM THE T.V. AND IT SOUNDS PRETTY GENIUS. BUT HELLO, COVER THE REST OF THE STUPID DOOR, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? [ LAUGHTER ] HE TURNS ON THIS BIG OLD PLASMA WITH THE BRIGHTNESS ON IT AND THROUGH THE HALLWAY, IT LOOKS LIKE IMMIGRATION IS BREAKING INTO THE BEDROOM. [ LAUGHTER ] WHATEVER. SO I PLAY IT OFF. I PRETEND I DON'T KNOW. AND THEN OF COURSE, IN THE MORNING, WHEN HIS ALARM GOES OFF AT 6:00 A.M., HE SLEEPS RIGHT THROUGH IT. AND IT'S AN ALARM ALARM. IT'S NOT THE RADIO. IT'S, YOU KNOW -- [ ALARM ] WHOLE HOUSE AWAKE. HIM? SO I WALK INTO HIS ROOM AND THAT ALARM IS BLARING. [ ALARM ] AND I SHAKE HIM, "FRANKIE, WAKE UP. FRANKIE, WAKE UP!" I SHAKE HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? HE EATS IN HIS SLEEP. I SHAKE HIM AND HE'S LIKE YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM. [ LAUGHTER ] HE DOESN'T WANT TO WAKE UP. SO WHAT I DO IS, I GET ON TOP OF THE BED AND I SLOWLY LAY ON TOP OF HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, YOU COULD HEAR HIM. OH, GOD! YOU'RE TOO BIG! YOU'RE TOO BIG! AND THEN I WHISPER IN HIS EAR, "THAT'S WHAT YOUR MOM SAID." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GUYS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GABRIEL IGLESIAS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
