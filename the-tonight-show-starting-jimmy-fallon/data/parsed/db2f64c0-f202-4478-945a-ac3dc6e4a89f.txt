SO YOU CAN GET IT ON THE iTUNES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOW CRAZY IS THAT?
Jimmy: YEAH. HAVE CAST ALBUMS JUST KIND OF ALL JUMPED BECAUSE OF "HAMILTON"?
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S, YEAH, GOING TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF SUCCESS. LIKE ACROSS THE -- LIKE.
Jimmy: WELL, BUT I THINK IN GENERAL, RIGHT? BECAUSE I EVERYONE'S LIKE, NOW, I THINK -- I DON'T KNOW.
YEAH, IT'S LIKE A NICE WAY TO SORT OF PRESERVE THE SHOW. IT'S NEVER BEEN FULLY RECORDED BEFORE, SO IT'S REALLY COOL THAT WE CAN DO IT.
Jimmy: BUT THIS IS ALL KIND OF FULL CIRCLE FOR YOU, BECAUSE YOU -- YOU SAW THIS?
I, YOU KNOW, I SAW IT ON THE TONY AWARDS IN 1992.
Jimmy: WHERE WERE YOU?
I WAS HOME IN NEBRASKA, IN OMAHA, NEBRASKA. AND I WAS SAW THIS SHOW ON THE TONY AWARDS, AND I REALLY, SORT OF, JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH IT AND OBSESSED ABOUT IT. AND NOW, IT'S VERY STRANGE TO GET TO BE DOING IT ON BROADWAY WITH THIS AMAZING CAST.
Jimmy: IT'S GOT TO BE. IT'S JUST TOTALLY COOL.
YEAH, IT'S REALLY NICE. YEAH, IT'S A REAL -- IT'S A A REAL PINCH-ME MOMENT, FOLKS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A REAL -- I REALLY LET YOU DOWN ON THAT PICTIONARY, MAN.

PICKPOCKET!
Jimmy: THAT WAS PERFECT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THAT WAS GREAT. "LADY AND THE TRAMP" WAS AWFUL.
THAT WAS PRETTY CRAZY.
Jimmy: JUST AWFUL.
BUT I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH HIS HOBO DRAWING, THOUGH. THAT WAS REALLY --
Jimmy: THAT WAS JUST A A BINDLE AND --
THAT WAS REALLY GREAT. THAT WAS REALLY, REALLY GREAT. I REALLY LIKED THAT ONE. THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK.
Jimmy: NO, I'M HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE.
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
Jimmy: I THINK ONE OF YOUR FIRST BIG MUSICALS, THAT WAS NOT "FALSETTOS," NOT "BOOK OF MORMON" --
NO, BEFORE THAT.
Jimmy: NOT WITH THE GREAT JOSH GAD. I GIVE HIM PROPS, BECAUSE I LOVE THAT GUY.
SURE, FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: BUT YOU WERE IN "THE KARATE KID" MUSICAL?
OKAY, WELL, LET'S CLARIFY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT WAS AN UNAUTHORIZED PARODY OF "THE KARATE KID", BECAUSE THEY PAID FOR IT, NO RIGHTS, SO IT WAS SO ILLEGAL. AND IT'S CALLED "IT'S KARATE, KID: THE MUSICAL." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I THINK THAT WAS GENIUS.
BECAUSE, LIKE, LEGALLY, I GUESS, THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GET AWAY WITH IT. DON'T -- NO. COME ON.
Jimmy: YES, LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS YOU RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT'S KARATE, KID.
IT'S KARATE, KID. THEY GOT IT RIGHT./
Jimmy: "IT'S KARATE, KID: THE MUSICAL."
APPARENTLY THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO DO TO GET AWAY WITH SOMETHING.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS.
JUST TOSS IN A COMMA.
Jimmy: THAT IS SO ILLEGAL.
YEAH, IT WAS BAD. AND I PLAYED JOHNNY LAWRENCE, THE SWEEP THE LEG JOHNNY. YOU KNOW, LIKE VILLAIN GUY?
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT THIS REALLY EXISTED AND THIS REALLY HAPPENED.
IT REALLY DID. IT WAS A REAL THING THAT HAPPENED, YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT NOW, LOOK AT YOU.
AND, NOW I'M LEGIT, SO IT'S FUNNY.
Jimmy: NOW, YOU'RE LEGIT. NOW YOU'RE IN "FALSETTOS."
BUT MAN, OH, MAN, I DID A A LOT OF -- THAT WAS AROUND THE TIME I WAS DOING A LOT OF RANDOM JOBS BEFORE I STARTED WORKING, LIKE, LEGIT BROADWAY STUFF.
Jimmy: LIKE WHAT?
UM, LIKE, I -- I WOULD MOSTLY WORK AT, LIKE, RESTAURANTS OR BARS FOR, LIKE, ONE NIGHT, AND THEN, I JUST WOULDN'T GO BACK. LIKE, I WOULD GET THE JOB AND I WOULD SHOW UP, AND THEY WOULD BE, LIKE, "HE SEEMS NORMAL." AND THEN I WOULD JUST NEVER GO AGAIN. UM, I --
Jimmy: YOU WOULDN'T SHOW UP FOR WORK.
I WOULDN'T SHOW UP FOR WORK. AND THEN TWICE, I WAS REMINDED THAT I USED THE EXCUSE -- BECAUSE I WOULD -- I ONCE WORKED AT A GYM IN BROOKLYN HEIGHTS CALLED EASTERN ATHLETIC. AND I WORKED THE MORNING SHIFT, SO I HAD TO OPEN IT AT, LIKE, 5:00 A.M. AND I WOULD GO, AND PEOPLE WOULD BE, LIKE, WAITING IN LINE TO GO WORK OUT AT THE GYM. AND ONE DAY, I WAS JUST, LIKE, NOT FEELING WELL, AND I -- [ LAUGHTER ] SICK FROM DRINK. AND I -- I DIDN'T GO. I JUST DIDN'T SHOW UP. SO ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE LOCKED OUT OF THE GYM, AND THE GYM JUST, LIKE, NEVER OPENED UNTIL SOMEBODY ELSE SHOWED UP.
Jimmy: THEY ARE PRETTY --
YEAH.
Jimmy: IN-SHAPE PEOPLE.
SO I WAS SO EMBARRASSED THAT I TOLD THEM THAT I HAD, LIKE, A A BREAKDOWN, AND I MOVED BACK TO NEBRASKA. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW I GOT OUT OF IT. BUT I LIVED ABOVE THE GYM. [ LAUGHTER ] MY DORM WAS, LIKE --
Jimmy: DID YOU HAVE TO GO IN AND OUT WITH A DISGUISE OR SOMETHING?
YEAH. I LIVED IN FEAR THAT I WAS GOING TO BE CAUGHT.
Jimmy: DID YOU EVER RUN INTO --
AND I USED THAT EXCUSE AGAIN, THAT EXACT SAME EXCUSE. WHILE I WAS DOING "KARATE KID," I WORKED AT WEST ELM, THAT STORE. AND AGAIN, I FAKED HAVING A A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, AND I WAS LIKE, "I HAVE TO MOVE BACK TO NEBRASKA." CUT TO, I'M DOING "IT'S KARATE, KID: THE MUSICAL."
Jimmy: AND IT WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
IT WAS THE WORST EXCUSE. LIKE WHY WOULD I --
Jimmy: DID YOU RUN INTO THESE PEOPLE? DID THEY --
YES, YEAH. AND THEY WOULD GIVE ME, LIKE, SIDE TILT, LIKE, "ARE YOU OKAY?" [ LAUGHTER ] "WHAT'S WRONG?" I'M LIKE, "OH, YEAH, MY BREAKDOWN. I FORGOT." [ LAUGHTER ] FORGOT ABOUT MY NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
Jimmy: NOW YOU'RE ON THE -- YOU GOT THE CAST ALBUM. YOU HAVE EVERYTHING ELSE.
I'M ON THE CAST ALBUM.
