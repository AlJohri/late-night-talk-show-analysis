Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HI, EVERYBODY! WELCOME! WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GUYS ARE THE SHOW. WHAT A CROWD. HOT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS ] WELL, YEAH. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. I HEARD THAT YESTERDAY, IVANKA TRUMP BUMPED INTO ROSIE O'DONNELL AT A RESTAURANT HERE IN NEW YORK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SHE SAID, "I'M SORRY HE'S SO OBSESSED WITH YOU." AND IVANKA WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I'M USED TO IT." [ LAUGHTER ] LISTEN TO THIS. TWO MORE PLAYBOY VIDEOS WERE UNCOVERED WHERE DONALD TRUMP MAKES A CAMEO. IN ANY OTHER ELECTION, A A CANDIDATE APPEARING IN THREE PORNOS WOULD END THEIR CAMPAIGN, BUT THIS YEAR IT'S JUST LIKE, "EH, WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TWO MORE ADULT FILMS WERE UNCOVERED THAT FEATURED AN APPEARANCE BY TRUMP. WHEN ASKED WHY IT TOOK SO LONG TO FIND THEM, REPORTERS WERE LIKE, "WE COULDN'T FIND ANYONE WILLING TO GOOGLE 'DONALD TRUMP PORNO.'" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DO IT. I DON'T WANT TO DO IT. I HAVE KIDS. YOU DO IT. ALMOST CAN'T UNSEE THAT STUFF. WHILE SPEAKING AT A RALLY IN NEVADA, YESTERDAY, TRUMP POINTED OUT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MISPRONOUNCE NEVADA LIKE "NE-VAH-DA." YEAH. BUT I THINK TRUMP MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE CONFUSED WHEN HE WAS POINTING THAT OUT. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID.
WE LOVE NEVADA. NEVADA. NE-VAH-DA. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID? YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID? I SAID, WHEN I CAME OUT HERE -- I SAID, NOBODY SAYS IT THE OTHER WAY. IT HAS TO BE NE-VAH-DA. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "I'D NEVER GET IT WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ] ESPECIALLY HERE IN LAS VEGAS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "I GUESS IT'S LIKE THAT OLD SAYING, YOU SAY POTATO, I SAY WRONG." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TRUMP ALSO TALKED ABOUT HIS RUNNING MATE, MIKE PENCE'S PERFORMANCE AT THE V.P. DEBATE THIS WEEK. OF COURSE, TRUMP NEVER HAS BEEN KNOWN TO EXAGGERATE. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HE MIGHT BE LAYING THIS ON A LITTLE THICK ON THIS ONE. CHECK THIS OUT.
I'D ARGUE THAT MIKE HAD THE SINGLE MOST DECISIVE VICTORY IN THE HISTORY OF VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT WINNING THE VICE PRESIDENT DEBATE IS LIKE WINNING A $2 SCRATCH-OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S COOL, I GUESS, BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. [ APPLAUSE ] I GUESS I'M A WINNER? I DON'T KNOW. GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE. DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ACCOUNTANT IS SPEAKING OUT ABOUT TRUMP'S 1995 TAX RETURNS. HERE HE IS GIVING HIS SIDE OF THE STORY ON "INSIDE EDITION." TAKE A LOOK.
HOW INVOLVED WAS DONALD TRUMP IN PREPARING HIS TAXES? OR DID HE JUST HAND EVERYTHING OVER TO YOU?
NO, I DID ALL THE TAX PREPARATION. HE NEVER SAW THE PRODUCT UNTIL IT WAS PRESENTED TO HIM FOR SIGNATURE.
REALLY, THIS WAS YOUR IDEA?
RIGHT, I'M THE ONE WHO DID ALL THE WORK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A A STRESSFUL JOB, BECAUSE THAT GUY IS ACTUALLY 36 YEARS OLD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WOW, ARE YOU SERIOUS? 36?
Jimmy: 36 YEARS OLD. YEARS YOUNG.
Steve: YEAH. 36 YEARS YOUNG.
Jimmy: THIS WEEK, THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY WAS ASKED ABOUT REPORTS OF CREEPY CLOWNS POPPING UP ACROSS THE NATION. I DON'T LIKE THIS STORY AT ALL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CREEPY CLOWNS ARE POPPING UP ACROSS THE NATION. HE SAID THAT HE WASN'T SURE IF PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD BEEN BRIEFED ON THE SITUATION. WHILE JOE BIDEN HASN'T SLEPT IN FIVE WEEKS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "YOU HEAR A HORN? THAT'S A RED NOSE! GIANT SHOE PRINTS." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS KIND OF COOL. I READ THAT A GROWING NUMBER OF SENIOR CITIZENS ARE SIGNING UP TO DRIVE FOR UBER. YEAH. PERSONALLY, I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. IN FACT, JUST TO SHOW MY SUPPORT, I'M GOING TO REQUEST A A SENIOR UBER RIGHT NOW. SEE IF SOMEONE PICKS UP. THERE HE IS, YEAH. MILTON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE'S GOING AROUND AT COLUMBUS CIRCLE -- HE MISSED THE TURN THERE. BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT. GOING TO GO AROUND -- JUST GO DOWN. HE'S GONNA GO UP THAT. YEP. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, HE MISSED THE TURN AGAIN. HE JUST KEEPS -- HE'S GOING IN CIRCLES. I WISH I COULD CALL. [ APPLAUSE ] I'LL CHECK IN --
Steve: HE'LL BE HERE.
Jimmy: I'LL CHECK IN WITH HIM LATER. I DON'T KNOW. HE'LL MAKE IT. HE'LL GET HERE EVENTUALLY. SOME CELEBRITY NEWS, HERE. I SAW THAT SUSAN SARANDON JUST TURNED 70. [ CHEERS ] YEAH. SHE SAYS HER TIPS FOR STAYING YOUNG ARE TO LAUGH AND HAVE SEX. THEN HER KIDS WERE LIKE, "GEEZ, MOM, JUST BLOW OUT THE CANDLES." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF 70-YEAR-OLDS, LET CHECK ON MY DRIVER ON UBER. MILTON. MILTON, WHERE ARE YOU, BUDDY? HE'S IN THE GRAND CANYON. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT THE HECK? MILTON. CANCEL. [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE STUPIDEST THING. CANCEL. I CAN'T EVEN CANCEL. FOUR STARS! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I SHOWED MILTON.
Steve: YOU SHOWED HIM.
Jimmy: I SHOWED HIM. I SHOWED HIM WHAT'S WHAT. THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY, YOU GUYS. A SOUTHWEST AIRLINES FLIGHT IN KENTUCKY HAD TO BE EVACUATED ON THE RUNWAY YESTERDAY AFTER SOMEONE'S SAMSUNG GALAXY PHONE STARTED SMOKING IN THE CABIN. EVEN THE GUY EATING A TUNA FISH SANDWICH WITH HIS SHOES OFF WAS LIKE, "COME ON, YOU CAN'T BRING THAT THING ON A PLANE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "THAT'S RUDE!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL, HERE. A NEW DAD IN UTAH IS CLAIMING THAT THE HOSPITAL BILLED HIM AN EXTRA $40 FOR HOLDING HIS BABY RIGHT AFTER HE WAS DELIVERED. THAT'S WHY MY DAD SAID, "I JUST STAYED AROUND THE BAR AROUND THE CORNER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE DIDN'T SAY THAT. I SCREWED THAT JOKE UP ANYWAY. YEAH. WHAT WAS THE JOKE? WHAT WAS THE PUNCHLINE? YEAH, THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. THE BABY WAS DELIVERED AND THEN MY DAD SAID, "THAT'S WHY I JUST STAYED AT THE BAR AROUND THE CORNER." YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S FUNNY. YEAH.

Jimmy: BUT ALSO YOU -- YOU HAVE ASPERGER'S IN THE FILM SO IT'S A VERY INTERESTING CHARACTER TO PLAY. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T -- YOU DON'T REALLY -- IT'S TOUGH TO PLAY BOTH ROLES.

THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD FEEL IT BUT EVERYONE WAS LIKE, JUST PLEASE SAY SARAH PAULSON.
OH, MY GOD. NO ONE FELT THAT WAY MORE THAN I DID. I WAS REALLY HOPING THEY WERE GOING TO SAY IT.
Jimmy: REALLY?
WELL, JUST BECAUSE I WANTED AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAND THERE AND SAY WHAT I SAID TO MARCIA ON BEHALF OF AMERICA, I THINK, TO JUST SAY, WE'RE SORRY FOR GETTING IT SO WRONG.

OH, THE MOLE WAS THE HARDEST PART.
Jimmy: RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: NO, THAT WOULD HAVE DROVE ME --
I WAS LIKE, ALSO, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO TRY TO PUT THAT THING ON IN THE MORNING IF THE TRAILER WAS SHAKING. THEY HAD A TINY LITTLE BOX WITH LIKE 18 DIFFERENT MOLES, AND THEN SOMEONE WOULD TAKE A A TWEEZER AND THEY'D BE LIKE, PLEASE NOBODY MOVE! NOBODY MOVE! YOU'D BE LIKE, OH, DAMN.
