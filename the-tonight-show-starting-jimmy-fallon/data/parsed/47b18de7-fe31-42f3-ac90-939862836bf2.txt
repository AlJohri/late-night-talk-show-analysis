Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- JASON SEGEL, LILLY SINGH, COMEDIAN BRIAN REGAN, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 648, YEAH!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY! THAT IS A HOT CROWD. THAT IS A HOT NEW YORK CITY CROWD! WELCOME, EVERYBODY! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO -- WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," BABY. THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "THE TONIGHT SHOW." WE GOT A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT ON THE STREETS THERE. IT'S BEEN A ROUGH FEW DAYS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND THIS WEEK IT CAME OUT THAT HIS JOB APPROVAL RATING IS AT JUST 36%. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] TRUMP WAS CONFUSED, HE SAID, "HOW CAN YOU DISAPPROVE OF A A JOB I'M NOT EVEN DOING? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FAKE POLL." TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATING IS AT JUST 36%, WHICH IS EVEN LOWER THAN OBAMA'S EVER WAS. THE ONLY TIME OBAMA CAME CLOSE TO THAT WAS WHEN HE HAD THAT MEETING WITH TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CAME CLOSE.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATING IS WORST THAN OBAMA'S LOWEST, AND WORSE THAN BILL CLINTON'S LOWEST. AFTER HEARING THIS, TRUMP PROMISED TO HUNT DOWN BIN LADEN AND SLEEP WITH AN INTERN.
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: TO SEE IF THAT WORKS OUT.
Steve: WOW. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: JUST SEE IF THAT WORKS OUT.
Steve: YEAH, SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
Jimmy: BUT TRUMP IS NOW POLLING LOWER THAN A LOT OF THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, HE'S LESS POPULAR THAN SITTING ON A WARM SUBWAY SEAT.
Steve: WOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S DISGUSTING. THAT'S THE WORST.
Steve: THAT'S NOT POPULAR.
Jimmy: YEAH. HE'S LESS POPULAR THAN VAGUE TEXT S THAT SAY, "DO YOU HAVE TIME TO TALK LATER, IT'S IMPORTANT." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GOD.
Steve: OH.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT GOOD.
Steve: THAT'S NOT POPULAR, AT ALL.
Jimmy: HE'S UNPOPULAR. HE'S LESS POPULAR THAN BITING INTO A COOKIE AND REALIZING THAT THE CHOCOLATE CHIP IS A A RAISIN.
Steve: OH! [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE ABSOLUTE -- THAT'S THE WORST.
Steve: THAT'S UNPOPULAR.
Jimmy: HE'S POLLING LESS THAN THAT, YEAH.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: HE'S LESS POPULAR THAN YOUTUBE ADS THAT YOU CAN'T SKIP AFTER FIVE SECONDS.
Steve: WHAT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DON'T MAKE ME WATCH THE WHOLE THING! [ CHEERS ]
Steve: THAT'S THE UNPOPULAR DANCE.
Jimmy: HE'S LESS POPULAR THAN WET DOORKNOBS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
Steve: OH! ♪♪ HEY! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S UNPOPULAR.
Jimmy: FINALLY, TRUMP IS EVEN POLLING LOWER THAN PEOPLE WHO PRONOUNCE CHIPOTLE AS CHIPOLTE.
Steve: YEAH! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. I COULDN'T EVEN PRONOUNCE IT.
Steve: NO. THAT'S NOT POPULAR.
Jimmy: I'M STILL ANGRY ABOUT THAT RAISIN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HAVE A COOKIE.
Jimmy: IT'S AN OAT MOAT MA GOAT RIGHT THERE. THAT'S NOT A CHOCKIE CHIP.
Steve: THAT'S HEALTH FOOD.
Jimmy: THAT'S AN OAT MA GOAT. NOT A CHOCKIE CHIP.
Steve: YEAH. YOU WANT A CHOCKO CHIPPO.
Jimmy: EVERYTHING'S GOT LITTLE PET NAMES NOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, I SAW THAT TRUMP WENT ON A TWITTER RANT ABOUT THE FAILURE OF THE REPUBLICAN HEALTH CARE BILL LAST NIGHT. THEN BLAMING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE FOR THE SITUATION, THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THIS NEW COMMERCIAL I SAW.
FROM THE CREATORS OF LIFE AND YAHTZEE, COMES A NEW BOARD GAME SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. "THE BLAME GAME." JUST ROLL THE DICE TO SEE WHO YOU SHOULD BLAME FOR YOUR LATEST PRESIDENTIAL FAILURE. PAUL RYAN, NANCY PELOSI, THE FREEDOM CAUCUS, WHOOPS, YOU LANDED ON YOURSELF. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT CAN'T BE TRUE, GO BACK FIVE SPACES TO DON JR. IF THINGS GET TOO HARD, JUST MOVE YOUR PIECE OVER TO MAR-A-LAGO AND COLLECT $2 MILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY. "THE BLAME GAME." FOR PRESIDENTS AGES 70 AND UP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT LOOKS FUN. FOR PRESIDENTS 70 AND OVER. WELL, HEY, THIS ISN'T GOOD. IT JUST CAME OUT, THAT TRUMP'S SON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER, HAD AN UNDISCLOSED MEETING WITH A A RUSSIAN BANK, THAT WAS UNDER SANCTIONS BY OBAMA. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WHEN HE HEARD HIS SON-IN-LAW WAS HAVING MEETINGS WITH SHADY RUSSIANS, TRUMP SAID, "YOU COULD START CALLING ME DAD." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SEAN SPICER WAS ASKED ABOUT TRUMP'S INVOLVEMENT WITH RUSSIA AGAIN AT HIS PRESS BRIEFING TODAY. SEAN SPICER, MAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LISTEN TO HOW HE RESPONDED TO THIS HERE.
I'VE SAID IT FROM THE DAY THAT I GOT HERE UNTIL WHATEVER, THAT THERE IS NO CONNECTION. YOU'VE GOT RUSSIA. IF THE PRESIDENT PUTS RUSSIAN SALAD DRESSING ON HIS SALAD TONIGHT, SOMEHOW THAT'S A A RUSSIAN CONNECTION. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: TRUMP SAID, "THAT'S RIDICULOUS. I WOULD NEVER EAT A SALAD. NEVER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S ACTUALLY FUNNY THAT SPICER MENTIONS FOOD THOUGH, BECAUSE AT YESTERDAY'S PRESS BRIEFING PEOPLE NOTICED HE HAD FOOD IN HIS TEETH. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] SPICER HAD SO MUCH FOOD IN HIS MOUTH, HE BARELY HAD ROOM FOR HIS FOOT.
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

BE COMFORTABLE IN MY OWN SKIN, NO MATTER HOW WEIRD I AM, IF I HAVE STRETCH MARKS, IF I HAVE LOVE HANDLES, I DON'T CARE. I WAS JUST LIKE, I LIVE WHO I AM. THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED I'M A A BAWSE.

SO YOU SAID, HI, MY NAME IS JIMMY, AND SHOOK HANDS WITH EVERYONE, AND WHEN YOU LEFT EVERYBODY WAS TAKEN SO ABACK BECAUSE YOU WERE SO SWEET AND DOWN TO EARTH, AND I THOUGHT, HE'S SHAKING WHAT HIS MAMA GAVE HIM, HIS HANDS, AND EVERYONE KNOWS YOU'RE JIMMY, BUT YOU DIDN'T CARE, YOU STILL DID IT.

JUST PLANE LOAD AFTER PLANE LOAD, JUST KEEP SHOVING BOOTS OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT THEM. THEY'LL BE LIKE, "WHAT ARE ALL THESE BOOTS ON THE GROUND!?"

THIS IS FIRST I'M HEARING ABOUT IT.

Jimmy: THEY'RE GETTING EVERY GREAT COMEDIAN. YOU, CHAPEL, CHRIS ROCK, JERRY SEINFELD. AND AMY SCHUMER. ALL THE BIG COMEDIANS ARE DOING THIS.

I SLIPPED OUT BEFORE THE CHECK CAME, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: WE WOULD PLAY A GAME WHERE WE'D TRY TO SNEAK IN A A FUNNY WORD INTO OUR ACT THAT WE'D NEVER USE IN OUR ACT. DO YOU STILL PLAY THAT GAME?
SOMETIMES, YEAH.
Jimmy: LIKE, WHAT WAS, I THINK IT WAS LUNCH MEATS OR SOMETHING?
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONCE. YOU'VE GOT TO WORK IT INTO A A BIT, THERE'S NO PLACE FOR IT. YOU JUST SAY IT OUT OF CONTEXT. THE ONLY LAUGH IS THE OTHER COMEDIANS IN THE BACK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S THE MOST FUN GAME.
HE SAID LUNCH MEAT.
Jimmy: I SAID SOME PRETTY GOOD LUNCH MEATS. YOU KNOW, I LIKE A SANDWICH. YOU KNOW, WITH MY CHOCKIE CHIP CHIP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DO YOU HANG OUT WITH FANS, DO YOU MEET THEM AFTER THE SHOW?
IT'S REALLY NICE, MAN. WHAT'S FUN IS I HAVE DIFFERENT AGE RANGES THAT SEEM TO LIKE WHAT I DO. WHICH IS VERY FLATTERING. BUT IT'S WEIRD, YOU KNOW? I HAD A LITTLE KID, I SWEAR, COME BACK AFTER THE SHOW WITH HIS FAMILY AND POINTED AT ME AND SAID, "WHY WERE YOU SO LOUD? I WAS TRYING TO SLEEP!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO MY ACT DURING NAP TIME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I HAD ANOTHER FAMILY COME BACK WITH, LIKE, THEIR GRANDMOTHER, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
A VERY NICE FAMILY. AND THE GRANDMOTHER WASN'T SAYING ANYTHING. SHE WAS OFF TO THE SIDE. OUT OF THE BLUE SHE JUST SAID, SO, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN VAUDEVILLE? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
