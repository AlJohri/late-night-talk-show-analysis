HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, EVERYBODY. ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT, DONALD TRUMP'S RECENT IMMIGRATION PLAN WOULD COST AT LEAST $166 BILLION. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WHEN ASKED HOW HE WOULD PAY FOR IT, TRUMP WAS LIKE, "NO HABLO ENGLISH." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO -- ACTUALLY, TRUMP GAVE A BIG INTERVIEW TO THE "HOLLYWOOD REPORTER." WHEN ASKED WHAT ACTOR HE WOULD WANT TO PLAY HIM IN A MOVIE, HE SAID, "SOMEBODY REALLY, REALLY HANDSOME." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HE SAID, "OKAY. I'LL DO IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I TALKED ME INTO IT. I TALKED ME INTO IT." AND LISTEN TO THIS, TRUMP SAID HE THINKS HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD FACE UP TO 20 YEARS IN PRISON OVER HER E-MAIL SCANDAL. WHEN THEY HEARD THAT, EVEN THE LADIES ON "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK" WERE LIKE, "OH GOD, PLEASE NO." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OH MY, NO. WE CAN'T. MOVE US. MOVE US OUT. NO, CAN'T MESS WITH THAT. I DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH THAT." [ APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF HILLARY, I READ THAT 60 OF HILLARY CLINTON'S PERSONAL E-MAILS BEING INSPECTED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN FLAGGED AS CONTAINING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. WHERE AS ALL OF MY MOM'S E-MAILS HAVE BEEN FLAGGED FOR HAVING NO INFORMATION. [ LAUGHTER ] "WHAT TIME'S DINNER? LOVE HONEY GOOD?" [ LAUGHTER ] WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A WHILE BACK, BUT THERE IS ACTUALLY A A CANDIDATE WHO IS REGISTERED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT UNDER THE NAME, DEEZ NUTS. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT DEEZ NUTS TURNED OUT TO BE A A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO SIGNED UP AS A PRANK. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP THE MEDIA FROM COVERING IT.
A SURVEY BY PUBLIC POLICY POLLING ALSO SHOWS A CANDIDATE BY THE NAME OF DEEZ NUTS POLLS AT 9%.
THE POLL SHOWS INDEPENDENT DEEZ NUTS TAKING 9% OF THE VOTE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE, DEEZ NUTS.
FIRST NAME DEEZ, LAST NAME NUTS.

Jimmy: I HAD THAT. IN MY FIRST APARTMENT I HAD A A PLACE, A SPOT IN MY STUDIO APARTMENT WHERE I COULD DO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, SO GOOD. THE REST IS JUST LIKE, I ACTUALLY JUST SIT IN BED AND COOK ON THE STOVE. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS A WEIRD STORY, HERE, BUT APPARENTLY A PARROT IN INDIA WAS ACTUALLY ARRESTED. [ LAUGHTER ] A PARROT IN INDIA WAS ARRESTED FOR SCREAMING OBSCENITIES AT A A WOMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] ARREST OF THE PARROT. SO I GUESS THAT MEANS THE PARROT COULD END UP GOING TO PRISON, OR AS THAT'S ALSO KNOWN, BEING A PARROT.

YOU'RE SO GOOD AT THIS JOB. I LOVE THIS JOB AND YOU IN IT.
Jimmy: OH, YOU'RE SO --
IT MAKES ME SO -- I WAS PLAYING WITH THE DOOBIE BROTHERS' GUITARS.
Jimmy: NO YOU WERE NOT.
I WAS. I TOUCHED THEM.
Jimmy: YOU DID?
I DID, YES.
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW NICE THE DOOBIE BROTHERS ARE, MAN. HOW COOL IS THAT?
I KNOW. I MEAN, THIS JUST, I MEAN, THAT HAPPENS BACKSTAGE AT YOUR JOB WHEN YOU'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING. IT'S SO COOL.

I HAVE AN INTERN ON MY SHOW WHO SAID TO ME AS I WAS LEAVING ON VACATION, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO ON VACATION, BUT I WAS TALKING ABOUT IT WITH MY FRIENDS AND WE DECIDED THAT YOU PROBABLY INVENT A NEW CATALOG SYSTEM FOR ALL YOUR BOOKS AT HOME. AND EVERY VACATION THERE'S -- I DON'T KNOW WHY I GIVE OFF THIS VIBE. NO, I JUST DRINK BEER AND GO FISHING.
Jimmy: OH, MAN, IS THAT RIGHT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S IT! I STOP WORKING AND THEN SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS IS I DRINK BEER AND GO FISHING --
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND, LIKE, LISTEN TO MUSIC ABOUT PEOPLE DRINKING BEER AND GOING FISHING.
Jimmy: OH THAT'S A GREAT -- DO YOU HAVE A NEW -- WHAT'S -- DO YOU HAVE A GOOD SONG THAT YOU LISTEN TO RIGHT NOW ABOUT DRINKING BEER AND GOING FISHING?
ANYTHING ON COUNTRY MUSIC RADIO RIGHT NOW -- [ CHEERS ] IS ABOUT DRINKING BEER AND OR GOING FISHING AND I'M JUST ALL OVER IT, YEAH.
Jimmy: DO YOU EVER HEAR THE SONG -- WHAT'S THE ONE WE'RE ALL INTO NOW? I KNOW --
"DAY DRINKING," THAT ONE?
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD ONE. "DAY DRINKING," BUT A "GUY WALKS INTO A BAR?" YOU EVER HEAR THIS SONG? THE KILLER -- IT'S WE ASK THE GUY TO COME ON THE SHOW AND HE SAID, NO, BECAUSE IT'S -- THE SONG'S ALREADY A HIT AND HE GOES, NO, THAT'S MY OLD SONG. I GO, BUT IT'S A GREAT SONG AND HE'S LIKE, EH, NAH. SO I GO, ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T NEED IT.

WE USED TO RUN INTO EACH OTHER AT BARS.
Jimmy: YES.
AND THEN I GOT OLD AND I STOPPED GOING TO BARS.
Jimmy: ME TOO!
I KNOW. I HATE IT.
Jimmy: I'M WINKING. I DON'T DO IT EITHER. BUT 'CAUSE WE LIKE THE ART OF IT. THE MIXOLOGY.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: THE FUN OF IT.
I AM AN ALCOHOL ENTHUSIAST AND THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER WORD THAT STARTS WITH ALCOHOL.
Jimmy: IT IS, IT REALLY IS. WHICH IS THE WAY THINGS WORK IN THE RECIPES AND WHAT GOES WITH WHAT AND BITTERS. AND YOU TAUGHT ME SOME STUFF AND SO WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT IT LATER ON. BUT DO YOU -- WHEN YOU'RE ON -- DO WATCH WHAT'S GOING ON? DO YOU SEE THE TRUMP STUFF AND DO YOU HAVE A COCKTAIL AND GO WOW, I WISH I WAS ON TV RIGHT NOW.
I JUST -- YES. HONESTLY, WEIRDLY, LIKE, THE TRUMP STUFF, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT. IF YOUR JOB IS TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN POLITICS, LIKE, DOING AN HOUR OF TV EVERYDAY.
Jimmy: I FEEL THIS TOO.
I FEEL LIKE MY JOB EVERY DAY IS LIKE, I GO -- I PAINT HOUSES, LIKE, WITH A NAIL POLISH BRUSH. LIKE, THAT'S MY JOB EVERY DAY, TO FILL IN A LITTLE TINY PIECE OF IT AND THEN ONE DAY I CAME TO WORK AND GOD WAS LIKE ACTUALLY TODAY, YOU GET A POWER SPRAYER. DO A FEW HOUSES TODAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE DONALD TRUMP IN POLITICS. GOD BLESS YOU, YOU MADE IT SO EASY.
Jimmy: OH, HE'S THE BEST PART OF OUR MONOLOGUE EVERY NIGHT FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS. YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S AWESOME. YEAH, IT'S REALLY IT'S A A BLESSING. IT'S A BLESSING FOR US. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE COUNTRY, BUT IF YOUR JOB IS -- [ LAUGHTER ] TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS. [ BLEEP ]
Jimmy: HE'S REALLY GOIN' FOR IT. I MEAN, THE WHEELS ARE JUST -- HE JUST DOES WHATEVER HE KIND OF FEELS LIKE AND THEN HE DOESN'T APOLOGIZE HE GOES, I JUST SAID THAT. WHICH IS KIND OF REFRESHING IN A WAY BECAUSE I GO, OH, THAT'S INTERESTING. HE JUST SAYS WHATEVER HE WANTS.
YEAH, AND HE SAYS STUFF THAT HAS NEVER BEEN SAID BEFORE, WHICH IS WHY EVERYBODY PUTS A A CAMERA ON HIM EVERY TIME HE STARTS TALKING. DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE THINGS HE'S SAYING SHOULD HAVE EVER BEEN SAID.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO! EXACTLY, NO! IT'S JUST INTERESTING. AND IT BRINGS UP AND MAKES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT STUFF. AND DO YOU THINK HE WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT FOR REAL? IS HE REALLY RUNNING?
I CAN'T IMAGINE, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT HE ACTUALLY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT. LOOK WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO BECOME PRESIDENT. LIKE BARACK OBAMA IS 40 YEARS OLDER THAN WHEN HE GOT SWORN IN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE REALLY DID AGE. OH MY GOSH.
GEORGE W. BUSH WENT FROM LIKE A CHARISMATIC FRAT BOY TO LIKE A RETIRED UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT WHO HAS LIKE FALLEN ON HARD TIMES. I MEAN, IT REALLY ROLLS THESE GUYS OVER. MEAN WHILE, DONALD TRUMP IS SUPPOSEDLY RUNNING THIS GIANT BUSINESS EMPIRE, BUT HE'S TAKING A FEW MONTHS OFF TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN HIS SPARE TIME. WHILE DOING NOTHING ON HIS BUSINESS AND EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE FINE. I DON'T THINK HE USUALLY HAS TO WORK VERY HARD. SO I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT BEING PRESIDENT SEEMS LIKE FUN. MAYBE HE WOULD BE ELECTED AND THEN HE'D LIKE OUTSOURCE IT TO SOMEBODY. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, CHINA WILL DO IT FOR THREE DOLLARS IT TURNS OUT. SO, I'M GONNA --
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD DEAL. YEAH, EXACTLY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND SO, BUT IF HE RUNS FOR -- IF HE RUNS INDEPENDENTLY, IF HE RUNS FOR THIRD PARTY, THEN IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHOE IN THAT -- A DEMOCRAT LIKE HILLARY CLINTON OR WHOEVER'S THE LEADER IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL WIN?
WHEN BILL CLINTON RAN AGAINST POPPY BUSH, REMEMBER ROSS PEROT WAS IN THE RACE.
Jimmy: POPPY BUSH.
HE DOESN'T MIND IF I CALL HIM POPPY. I NAMED MY DOG AFTER HIM. I HAVE A DOG NAMED POPPY.
Jimmy: I'M SURE YOU DO. THAT'S GREAT.
HE'S MORE NAMED AFTER DAVID ORTIZ, BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT BILL CLINTON RAN AGAINST POPPY BUSH, MADE W's DAD A ONE TIME PRESIDENT AND ROSS PEROT WAS IN THAT RACE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND EVERYBODY, LIKE, SORT OF THOUGH MAYBE THAT ROSS PEROT WAS THE REASON BILL CLINTON WON. IT'S INTERESTING, IN THAT RACE HE REALLY TOOK EQUALLY FROM THE DEMOCRATS AND THE REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE ROSS PEROT RAN THIS CAMPAIGN THAT WAS NEITHER RIGHT WING NOR LEFT WING. DONALD TRUMP IS RUNNING A A TOTALLY RIGHT WING CAMPAIGN SO AND SO IF HE RAN AS AN INDEPENDENT HE WOULD TAKE A LOT OF VOTES AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND I THINK IT WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE DEMOCRAT WOULD WIN IT. GUARANTEE IT.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND IF HE WENT REPUBLICAN AND WON FOR THE REPUBLICANS THEN THEY WOULD OWE HIM --
WELL, IF HE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THANK GOD, DUDE, YOU DID IT. YOU WON.
IF HE DECIDED NOT -- IF HE -- HE'S SORT OF THREATENING TO RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT, RIGHT? IF HE DECIDES NOT TO --
Jimmy: BUT DIDN'T YOU LIKE THAT? WHEN YOU SAW THE DEBATE AND HE'S LIKE, THAT WAS KIND OF A A TRICKY QUESTION. AND YOU'RE LIKE, ANYONE HERE RAISE THEIR HAND IF THEY WOULD EVEN THINK OF RUNNING ON A A DIFFERENT PARTY AND HE WAS LIKE, YEAH.
THIS GUY!
Jimmy: BUT I WAS LIKE, WELL, THAT WAS KIND OF GUTSY. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE LIKE THIS. LIKE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GONNA DO, BUT YOU APPRECIATE HIS HONESTY.
IT'S ACTUALLY GENIUS. I DON'T THINK HE'S A DUMB GUY. I DON'T THINK THAT HE'S PLAYING A DUMB GAME HERE. WHAT HE'S DOING WITH THAT IS GENIUS. IF HE WAS GOING TO SAY AT THAT DEBATE, NO, NO, NO. I'LL NEVER RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT, I'LL ONLY RUN AS A A REPUBLICAN, HE LOSES ALL HIS LEVERAGE. THEN HE'S JUST ONE OF THE OTHER REPUBLICANS. BUT IF HE SAYS NO, YOU GUYS BE NICE TO ME OR I'M GONNA JUMP IN AS AN INDEPENDENT THEREBY GUARANTEEING HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE NEXT PRESIDENT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT MEANS IF HE DOESN'T DO THAT, THE REPUBLICANS OWE HIM FOREVER. AND IF HE DOES DO THAT, HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT AND SHE OWES HIM FOREVER. NICE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO RIGHT NOW HE WILL NEVER HAVE MORE POWER THAN HE HAS RIGHT NOW. 'CAUSE EITHER WAY THIS GOES, WHETHER HE RUNS AS AN INDEPENDENT OR HE DOESN'T, HALF OF THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO OWE HIM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH, WHICH IS FANTASTIC --
THE ART OF THE DEAL!
Jimmy: THE ART OF THE DEAL! [ APPLAUSE ]
THE ART OF THE DEAL. IT'S PERFECT.

ARTIE I LOVE YOU! PEOPLE SAY TO ME, "ARTIE, DO YOU GET A LOT OF SEX FROM BEING ON THE RADIO?" AND I'M LIKE, "IF I AM WILLING TO BANG PLUMBERS I WOULD BE LIKE A YOUNG WARREN BEATTY. [ LAUGHTER ]

YEAH.
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. EVERY TIME YOU'RE HERE WE HAVE THE BEST TIME.
WE DO.
Jimmy: WE DO. THIS IS FANTASTIC.
I CAN'T FIT IN THE CHAIR THIS TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] IT GETS HARDER AND HARDER.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T LEAVE. YOU'RE STUCK HERE. YOU CAN'T GET OFF. YOU CAN'T GET OUT. WE JUST HEARD RACHEL'S TAKE ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. DO YOU HAVE A TAKE ON WHAT'S GOING ON?
WELL, YOU KNOW. LISTEN. TRUMP CLAIMS TO NOT DRINK. BUT, HE SAYS STUFF THAT MAKES HIM SOUND DRUNK. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S GREAT. A GUY THAT DOESN'T DRINK BUT SOUNDS DRUNK. IT'S VERY ENTERTAINING. EVERYTHING HE SAYS HE SOUNDS LOADED. HE'S LIKE, "I'LL BUILD A WALL AROUND MEXICO!" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU SOUND LIKE --
YOU'RE LIKE WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THAT? THE KING OF MEXICO! [ LAUGHTER ] THEY HAVE A KING? YEAH THEY GOT A KING.
Jimmy: LIKE YOUR UNCLE AT THANKSGIVING.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: BUT THEN YOU LIKE -- YOU PLAYED BASEBALL OR SOFTBALL?
SOFTBALL.
Jimmy: SOFTBALL WAS ONE OF THE CANDIDATES? YANKEE STADIUM.
Jimmy: WITH CHRIS CHRISTIE.
ME AND CHRIS CHRISTIE. LOOK AT ME NEXT TO CHRIS CHRISTIE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHY I LOVE THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] I LOOK LIKE SARAH JESSICA PARKER. [ LAUGHTER ] I LITERALLY, I HAVE MARY KATE OLSON'S ASS. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK AT HIS ASS.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH.

Jimmy: COULD BE. ABSOLUTELY. LOOK, I'M A JERSEY GUY. I LOVE THE GUY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH.
I TELL YOU WHAT, I'VE BEEN IN SHOW BUSINESS FOR 25 YEARS ON AND OFF AND I NEVER GET INVITED TO LIKE THE HAMPTONS. YOU COULD THROW ME A BONE, DUDE. I MEAN, YOU KNOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE KNOW EACH OTHER. SO ORIGINALLY YOU WERE AT RON PERLMAN'S PARTY OR SOMETHING. YOU DO A BIG PARTY. HERE'S WHAT I DID LAST WEEKEND. I'VE BEEN IN SHOW BUSINESS 25, MY HAND -- JERSEY PEOPLE APPRECIATE THIS. I WENT TO AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY AT A KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS. [ LAUGHTER ]

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] PERTH AMBOY IS THE KIND OF TOWN WHERE DOGS WALK AROUND AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO STEP IN HUMAN CRAP. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU ACTUALLY SEE IT. [ BARKS ]
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU JUST CAME BACK FROM MONTREAL?
I WAS IN MONTREAL. THAT WAS GOOD, YOUR FRENCH.
Jimmy: THE MONTREAL COMEDY FESTIVAL.
MONTREAL. IT'S TOO DAMN FRENCH UP THERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AN HOUR IN A PLANE. ONE HOUR IN A PLANE. YOU GET OFF THE PLANE AND IT'S LIKE YOU'RE IN ROMANIA OR SOMETHING. AN HOUR THE OTHER DIRECTION YOU'RE IN BALTIMORE.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND LIKE AN HOUR, YOU'RE UP THERE. AND LISTEN. IT'S VERY ODD. IT'S CULTURE SHOCK. HEARING A HOMELESS PERSON BEG FOR MONEY IN FRENCH IS VERY ODD. BECAUSE FRENCH IS SUCH A A SOPHISTICATED LANGUAGE.

THEY'RE ALL HAPPY BECAUSE THEY'RE BILINGUAL UP THERE. THEY'RE VERY ARROGANT ABOUT BEING BILINGUAL. I'M LIKE CALM DOWN WITH THE BILINGUAL. LOOK, I'M A SLOB AND I'M SOMEWHAT BILINGUAL. I LEARNED A LITTLE SPANISH BUYING COCAINE IN THE BRONX FOR TEN YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO.
IT'S A FUN WAY TO LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT, IT'S A BIT PRICEY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I THINK ROSETTA STONE, YOU LEARN THE WHOLE SPANISH LANGUAGE FOR $49.95.
