Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- SIR BEN KINGSLEY, HENRY CAVILL, MUSICAL GUEST REBA McENTIRE, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 311, DOWN, DOWN.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE'S YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HEY, HOT CROWD! HOT CROWD. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT. THIS IS WHERE WE ARE. THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME NEWS, YOU GUYS. SOME BIG POLITICAL NEWS HERE. BERNIE SANDERS IS POLLING AT 44% AMONG DEMOCRATS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TO OFFICIALLY PASS HILLARY CLINTON AS THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WOW. AND IN ANOTHER NEW POLL, ZERO PERCENT OF HILLARY'S STAFFERS WANT TO BE THE ONE WHO BRING HER THAT NEWS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY GO, "YOU DO IT. I DON'T WANNA DO IT. YOU DO IT. I DON'T WANNA DIE. I DON'T WANNA DIE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SANDERS HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN TRAILING HER BY 36 POINTS, BUT NOW HE HAS AT A 7 POINT LEAD. YEAH, I THINK HE MIGHT BE GETTING A LITTLE COCKY BECAUSE -- I JUST -- TAKE A A LOOK AT THE NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGANS HE'S TRYING OUT HERE. FIRST THERE'S -- "YES, WE CAN? MORE LIKE YES, I DID." [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT ONE, THERE'S -- "BERN DOWN FOR WHAT?" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT THERE'S -- "ENOUGH BS. IT'S TIME FOR B.S." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEN THERE'S -- "HILLARY JUST GOT WEAKENED AT BERNIE'S." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: REALLY? WOW.
Jimmy: FINALLY, THERE'S -- "CAN I LIVE EIGHT MORE YEARS? LET'S FIND OUT TOGETHER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S JUST TOO MORBID. A LITTLE MORBID. AND I DON'T -- THAT'S TOO MUCH. I THINK THAT'S A BIT MORBID. SPEAKING OF HILLARY THOUGH, OFFICIALS INVESTIGATING HER E-MAIL SCANDAL FOUND THAT TWO OF THE FOUR CLASSIFIED E-MAILS ON HER PRIVATE ACCOUNT HAD INFORMATION THAT WAS LABELED "TOP SECRET." [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] IT'S PRETTY STUPID. I MEAN, EVERYONE KNOWS IF YOU WANT TO HIDE STUFF IN YOUR COMPUTER, YOU PUT IT IN A A FOLDER LABELED "TAX STUFF 2008." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BET NO ONE LOOKED THERE. YEAH. THAT'S WHERE YOU HIDE EVERYTHING. AT A PRESS CONFERENCE THIS WEEK, HILLARY CLINTON TRIED TO CLARIFY THAT SHE ONLY WENT TO DONALD TRUMP'S WEDDING IN 2005 BECAUSE SHE, "THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT OF COURSE THAT'S NOT THE STORY TRUMP TOLD AT THE DEBATES.
WITH HILLARY CLINTON, I SAID, "BE AT MY WEDDING," AND SHE CAME TO MY WEDDING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "THEN I SAID, 'DO THE ELECTRIC SLIDE, AND SHE ELECTRIC SLID.'" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WOW. ACTUALLY, IT LOOKS LIKE THINGS MIGHT BE SLOWING DOWN A BIT FOR TRUMP. IN FACT, HE RECENTLY DROPPED NINE POINTS IN SOME OF THE LATEST POLLS. WHEN HE HEARD THAT, TRUMP WAS LIKE, "OH, NO, WAS IT EVERYTHING I SAID?" [ LAUGHTER ] CHECK THIS OUT. YOU GUYS, IN A RECENT INTERVIEW JEB BUSH REVEALED THAT HIS BROTHER GEORGE GAVE HIM THE NICKNAME "TORTOISE" BECAUSE HE'S MAKING SLOW, STEADY PROGRESS. [ LAUGHTER ] THOUGH I THINK THE BIGGER STORY HERE IS THAT COMPARED TO GEORGE, JEB IS THE SLOW ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] SOME INTERNATIONAL NEWS HERE. I SAW THAT KIM JONG-UN GREETED NORTH KOREA'S WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE AIRPORT AFTER THEY WON THE EAST ASIAN CUP. YEAH. THOUGH I THINK THE BIGGER STORY HERE IS THAT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE GOT TO LEAVE NORTH KOREA AND ACTUALLY CAME BACK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S LIKE WAIT, THAT WAS YOUR CHANCE. THAT WAS YOUR CHANCE TO GET OUT. SOME MORE CELEBRITY NEWS HERE, GUYS. I READ THAT LEONARDO DICAPRIO WON ALMOST $9,000 IN A A DEFAMATION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE FRENCH TABLOID "OOPS!" -- [ LAUGHTER ]  -- FOR CLAIMING RIHANNA WAS PREGNANT WITH HIS CHILD. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT CASE TO LEO. HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT. "I HOPE THIS CASE TEACHES TABLOIDS THAT CELEBRITIES ARE HUMAN BEINGS THAT DESERVE RESPECT RATHER THAN MADE-UP GOSSIP TO SELL MAGAZINES." "BUT ALSO, GUESS WHO JUST GOT ALMOST $9,000? [ LAUGHTER ] KNOCK KNOCK, WHO'S THERE? ME. ME AND JUST A SHADE UNDER 9K. THAT'S WHO. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, CLOSE TO $9,000. I COULD GET A HUGE TV AND A A SUPER COMFY COUCH, STILL HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER FOR A PIZZA PARTY AND MAYBE A GIRL WILL COME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S VERY EXCITED. DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THAT MONEY.
Steve: IT'S 9K.
Jimmy: THIS IS A PRETTY CRAZY STORY HERE. THIS WEEK IN GEORGIA A BEAR APPARENTLY STOLE ALL THE LUNCHES FROM A WORK CREW'S VAN, WHILE THEY WERE WORKING, AND ENDED UP ACTUALLY HANGING OUT IN THE VAN FOR A BIT. [ LAUGHTER ] TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PHOTO. LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WEIRDER, THAT THERE'S A BEAR IN THERE, OR THAT IT LOOKS LIKE HE TOTALLY BELONGS THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK AT HIM, HE'S JUST HANGING OUT. LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO START CATCALLING LADY BEARS WALKING BY. [ LAUGHTER ] "YO, BABY, YOU GOT MY SALMON SWIMMING UPSTREAM OVER HERE!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY! HEY!
Jimmy: HEY!
Steve: HEY!
Jimmy: YO! FINALLY, I READ THAT "FRIENDS" STARS DAVID SCHWIMMER, MATT LeBLANC, AND MATTHEW PERRY WERE NOT INVITED TO JENNIFER ANISTON'S RECENT WEDDING TO ACTOR JUSTIN THEROUX. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WHILE BOTH PERRY AND LeBLANC HAVE SAID THAT THEY'RE VERY HAPPY FOR ANISTON, NO ONE HAS HEARD ANYTHING FROM DAVID SCHWIMMER. WELL, I WANTED TO HEAR HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT ALL THIS SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE HIM ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW, FROM LOS ANGELES. DAVID, ARE YOU THERE?

YEAH. HOW CAN SHE DO THAT? I MEAN, LOOK, I MAY NOT OWN A A PORSCHE AND I MAY NOT BE ONE OF THOSE BIG STRONG MUSCLEY BEACH BODY GUYS BUT I LOVE RACHEL AND I ALWAYS HAVE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING, RIGHT CHANDLER? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M NOT CHANDLER. I'M JIMMY.

Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. JIMMY.
RIGHT, PHEEBS? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
DAVID, I THINK YOU'RE CONFUSING THE CHARACTERS ON "FRIENDS" WITH REAL LIFE.
OH, I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO. I'LL GO TO THE AIRPORT AND STOP HER BEFORE SHE GETS ON THAT FLIGHT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT FLIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING --
OH, THIS WILL BE GREAT. SHE'LL NEVER SEE THIS COMING.
Jimmy: NO, NO, DAVID. SHE'S ALREADY MARRIED.
