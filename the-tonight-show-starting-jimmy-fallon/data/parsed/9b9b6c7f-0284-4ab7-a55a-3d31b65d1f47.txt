Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY! WELCOME! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE SHOW. WE'RE HERE IN NEW YORK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HAVING A GREAT TIME. WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, EVERYBODY. THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN SEASON IS REALLY STARTING TO HEAT UP. IN FACT HILLARY CLINTON IS HEADED TO L.A. THIS MONTH TO ATTEND A FUNDRAISER HOSTED BY "SPIDER-MAN" STAR TOBEY MAGUIRE. IT'S NOT SURPRISING, THEY'VE BEEN FRIENDS EVER SINCE THEY MET BACK IN 2002. DO YOU REMEMBER THIS? PHOTO WAS GOING AROUND -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, HILLARY SAID SHE'S A A BIG FAN OF SPIDER-MAN, BECAUSE IT PROVES THAT AMERICANS STILL LOVE SEQUELS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PART TWO. BUT NOT, NOT ALL GOOD NEWS FOR HILLARY CLINTON. ACCORDING TO A NEW POLL, THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS WHO TRUST HER IS DROPPING. SPECIFICALLY INTO A HOLE THAT HILLARY COVERED WITH LEAVES. [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT YOU! JUST STAY THERE UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. I'LL GET YOU OUT. SOME MORE CAMPAIGN NEWS. YESTERDAY, SEVERAL GOP CANDIDATES ATTENDED THE ECONOMIC GROWTH SUMMIT AT THE YACHT AND BEACH CLUB AT DISNEY WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] INCIDENTALLY THE ECONOMIC GROWTH SUMMIT AT THE YACHT AND BEACH CLUB IS THE LEAST POPULAR RIDE AT DISNEYWORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] NEVER A LINE FOR THAT. GET THIS. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT CHINA HAS INTRODUCED NEW RULES THAT REQUIRE REALITY TV SHOWS TO BE MORE HONEST AND NOT MISLEAD VIEWERS. THE REQUIREMENT ALSO APPLIES TO AMERICAN SHOWS THAT AIR IN CHINA, SO A LOT OF THEM HAD TO CHANGE THERE TITLES. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN. CHECK THIS OUT. "THE AMAZING RACE" BECOMES -- "GETTING DIVORCED WHILE ON VACTION." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU MAKE A LEFT! YOU TOLD ME TO MAKE A LEFT. [ LAUGHTER ] I HATE YOU. "SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE" BECOMES -- "YOU CANNOT DANCE." [ LAUGHTER ] WHY TRY? NO. AFTER THAT, "HOUSE HUNTERS" BECOMES -- "THIRTY-MINUTE AD FOR GRANITE COUNTERTOPS." [ LAUGHTER ] I'D LOVE TO MOVE IN HERE. JUST, I'D REALLY LOVE SOME GRANITE COUNTERTOPS. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL WE CAN'T CHANGE THAT, GARY.
Steve: YEAH. CAN'T BE CHANGED.
Jimmy: I DON'T LIKE THE COLOR OF THIS KITCHEN. LET'S NOT MOVE HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, "KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS" BECOMES -- "UNEMPLOYED WOMEN MAKE DOLPHIN NOISES." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S JUST CRAZY. [ DOLPHIN NOISES ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MUCH MORE HONEST THERE. OF COURSE, ANOTHER BIG STORY THIS WEEK IS THAT KIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST ARE EXPECTING THEIR SECOND CHILD. AND I HEARD THAT THE BABY IS ACTUALLY DUE TO ARRIVE IN DECEMBER. YEAH, WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEN FOR THE BIRTH OF THE LITTLE BABY YEEZUS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'D BE SO CUTE. IT'S CUTE, YEAH. AND LISTEN TO THIS, IN A RECENT INTERVIEW GEORGE CLOONEY SAID THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN PLASTIC SURGERY AND THINKS PEOPLE SHOULD JUST TRY TO LOOK THE BEST THEY CAN AT THEIR AGE. AND THE INTERVIEWER WAS LIKE, "GREAT, DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T GEORGE CLOONEY? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THAT'S WHO YOU LOOK LIKE." CHECK THIS OUT. A TECHNOLOGY BLOGGER RECENTLY REVIEWED GOOGLE'S SELF-DRIVING CARS AND SAID THAT THEY "DRIVE LIKE YOUR GRANDMA." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MAINLY, BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM, YOU DON'T SEE ANYONE DRIVING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: AWOOGA.
Jimmy: I THINK THIS IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. LAST WEEKEND IN SAN DIEGO, 92-YEAR-OLD HARRIETTE THOMPSON BECAME THE OLDEST WOMAN TO EVER COMPLETE A MARATHON. 92. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHILE THE GUY WHO FINISHED AFTER HER MADE HISTORY BY BEING THE FIRST PERSON NOT TO BRAG ABOUT RUNNING A MARATHON. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, I GUESS I DID, I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER. I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER WHO WON. IT DOESN'T MATTER. DOESN'T MATTER IF ANYONE BEAT ME OR WHATEVER. WELL, THIS ISN'T REALLY THAT SURPRISING. I READ THAT CUSTOMER RATINGS FOR CABLE COMPANIES ARE NOW LOWER THAN EVER, WITH TIME-WARNER ACTUALLY RECEIVING THE LOWEST SCORE. WELL, WE WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT TIME WARNER IS DOING ABOUT THIS. SO HERE NOW IS TIME WARNER-REPRESENTATIVE, ALAN BRINT. ALAN? [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WELCOME. NOW LET ME FIRST ASK, WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THESE LOW CUSTOMER RATINGS FOR YOUR COMPANY?
THANK YOU, JIMMY. THIS INTERVIEW MAY BE MONITORED OR RECORDED FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE PURPOSES. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: GUYS, THIS IS PRETTY AMAZING. A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT CHIMPANZEES ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO COOK FOOD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED HOW THEY LEARNED TO COOK, CHIMPS SAID, "IT WAS EASY, UM, I MEAN, WE CAN'T TALK. [ LAUGHTER ] OOO-AAA, BANANAS. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE." AND FINALLY, THIS IS PRETTY GREAT. IN THEIR GAME AGAINST THE CARDINALS LAST NIGHT, THREE MILWAUKEE BREWERS PLAYERS TRIED TO CATCH A FOUL BALL AND WELL, TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED.
CARPENTER LEADING OFF, SENDS ONE IN THE AIR. FOUL. SEE IF IT'LL STAY PLAYABLE. THREE CONVERGE ON IT AND ALL THREE COME TOGETHER. [ LAUGHTER ]

[ LAUGHTER ] [ COCKNEY ACCENT ] I DON'T LIKE THAT YOU THOUGHT I WAS FUNNY IN THAT COMEDY. BUT HE REALLY IS FUNNY. JASON STATHAM IS HERE!
Steve: COME ON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE'S THE BEST. I LOVE HIM. HE'S SO GOOD. THEY'RE ALL GOOD IN THAT MOVIE. I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE JASON TO A GAME OF "SLAPJACK" LATER IN THE SHOW. I DON'T KNOW WHY I WOULD DO THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? INTERNATIONAL TOUGH GUY.
Jimmy: IF YOU WANT TO SEE MANY GET SLAPPED BY JASON STATHAM. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
Steve: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW WHY --

IT'S SUCH A FUNNY MOVIE. EVERYBODY SCORES IN IT. MELISSA McCARTHY OBVIOUSLY IS HILARIOUS. PETER SERAFINOWICZ, ROSE BYRNE. BUT YOU, I GOT TO SAY, THE SCREENING I SAW WHERE I WAS IN THEATER, EVERYONE -- YOU DESTROYED WITH EVERY SINGLE LINE. EVERYTHING YOU KEPT SAYING WAS LIKE, "I CAN'T WAIT TO TALK TO HIM AND CONGRATULATE HIM." I DON'T IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW FUNNY YOU ARE OFF CAMERA CAUSE YOU ARE ALWAYS A TOUGH GUY IN THESE MOVIES. BUT YOU GO ON THESE RANTS OF ACTUALLY HOW TOUGH YOU ARE.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THERE'S -- YOU SAID MORE LINES IN THIS MOVIE THAN THE PAST EIGHT FILMS YOU'VE MADE. I GOT TO SAY -- [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S TRUE, YEAH. IT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: BUT, GOSH, WERE THEY IMPROVISED? DID YOU MAKE THEM UP OR DID THEY --
MELISSA IS A GREAT IMPROVISER. YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING THAT PAUL FEIG DOES HE WANTS TO GET THIS SORT OF REALTIME REACTION. SO HE GIVE YOU THINGS ON POST-IT NOTES. SO THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE SAYING IT, IS ACTUALLY ON CAMERA SO MELISSA DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING TO SAY. THE TOUGH PART IS KEEPING A A STRAIGHT FACE. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT.
Jimmy: GOSH, THIS IS A A PERFECT ACCENT YOU'RE THE PERFECT GUY TO DELIVER THESE THINGS, AND YOU GO THROUGH THIS LIST. WE'LL SHOW A CLIP -- ONE OF THE LISTS THAT YOU GO THROUGH JUST TRYING TO PROVE TO HER HOW TOUGH YOU ARE. BUT THEN THERE'S ONE THING AT -- TOWARDS THE END OF THE FILM YOUR CHARACTER WEARS TURTLENECKS AND BLAZERS.
RIGHT, RIGHT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND I JUST LOVE THAT. BUT UM -- YOU'RE BRAGGING ABOUT HOW TOUGH YOU ARE IN THE WHOLE MOVIE. AND THEY GO -- THAT'S A A BEAUTIFUL BLAZER YOU HAVE WHERE DID YOU GET IT AND YOU GO, "MADE IT, DIDN'T I?" [ LAUGHTER ] THAT DOESN'T EVEN PROVE THAT YOU'RE TOUGH. IT PROVES THAT YOU ARE A GOOD TAILOR. I MEAN -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT REALLY -- HONESTLY, I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY MADE ME LAUGH, MAN. CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS. AND IT'S -- JUDE LAW IS A SPY. AND EVERYONE'S IN THE CIA. AND SO MELISSA McCARTHY HAS TO GO UNDERCOVER TO STOP SOMEONE FROM BUYING A NUCLEAR BOMB, THAT'S BASICALLY IT. AND I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP HERE. AND ALSO STAY TUNED AFTER THE CREDITS AFTER THE CREDITS I SHOULD SAY.

Jimmy: BEN, YEAH, NO.
HE'S LIKE, "TAKE YOUR HANDS OUT FROM UNDER THE DUVET." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT COULD BE THE NAME OF THE SEQUEL. "TAKE YOUR HANDS OUT FROM UNDER THE DUVET." [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S A CLIP. I'M TELLING YOU, THIS CHARACTER IS GONNA BE A SPUNOFF CAUSE IT WAS JUST FANTASTIC. HERE IS JASON STATHAM WITH MELISSA McCARTHY IN "SPY." TAKE A LOOK.

DID YOU FORGET, I AM UNDERCOVER. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.
YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE READY FOR THE FIELD? I ONCE USED DEFIBRILLATORS ON MYSELF. I JUMPED FROM A HIGH RISE BUILDING USING ONLY A RAINCOAT AS A PARACHUTE. [ LAUGHTER ] I BROKE BOTH LEGS UPON LANDING. I SWALLOWED ENOUGH MICROCHIPS AND [ BLEEP ] BACK OUT AGAIN TO MAKE A COMPUTER. THIS ARM HAS BEEN RIPPED OFF COMPLETELY AND REATTACHED THIS WITH [ BLEEP ] ARM. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU'RE NOT REALLY THAT TOUGH. I MEAN, MEDICALLY? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: REATTACHED WITH THIS ARM. OH MY GOSH, IT IS GREAT, MAN. I WAS CRYING LAUGHING. THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE RANTS HE GOES THROUGH. CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN ON THIS ONE. I'M GLAD YOU'RE HAVING A GREAT YEAR. I WOULD LIKE TO CHALLENGE YOU TO A FRIENDLY, FUN GAME OF -- "SLAPJACK."

I STOPPED OFF AT THE INTERNET CAFE AS ONE DOES AND I WAS CHECKING MY E-MAILS AND MY MANAGER SENT ME THE SCRIPT. HE SAID YOU HAVE TO READ THIS. IT'S GREAT AND YOU'RE PERFECT FOR IT.
Jimmy: WHY WERE YOU IN MEXICO, CAN I ASK?
I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO GO TO CUBA TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT CUBAN HIP HOP.
Jimmy: REALLY? DID I KNOW MANY CUBAN HIP HOP ARTISTS? [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL NO, IT'S AN UNDERGROUND CULTURE THERE.
Jimmy: MELLOW MAN ACE, WOULD HE BE ONE? WAS HE CUBAN? MIAMI? "ESCAPE FROM HAVANA", RIGHT, IS THE NAME OF HIS ALBUM.
I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: EH, NEVERMIND, DON'T PUT HIM IN THE DOCUMENTARY. SO YOU ARE OUT THERE IN MEXICO HOPING TO GO TO CUBA.
YES, AND I GET THIS E-MAIL. ABOUT TO GO. I HAD TO GET AN INTERNATIONAL CALLING CARD. I WAS SCROUNGING FOR CHANGE, I GOT IT, I CALLED MY MANAGER. I WENT THROUGH FOUR INTERNATIONAL CALLING CARDS. THEY KEPT HANGING UP ON ME. "YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT."
Jimmy: NO, I KNOW THAT -- BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT THE MINIMUM CARD.
YEAH, EXACTLY, THE LOWEST AMOUNT. AND I WAS LIKE, "I CAN'T KEEP CALLING YOU, MAN, I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO CALL YOU." HE'S LIKE, "JUST COME." I'M LIKE, "CAN YOU SEND ME A A PLANE TICKET?" HE HAD TO FLY ME TO L.A. TO AUDITION AND, OF COURSE, CHANGED MY LIFE. THE REST IS HISTORY.
Jimmy: WOW, OH MY GOSH. AND YEAH, CONGRATULATIONS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
AND NOW HERE WE ARE DOING A A MOVIE!
Jimmy: NOW IT'S GREAT! YOU'RE DOING THE MOVIE AND THE MOVIE IS SO FANTASTIC. IT'S FUN. IF YOU GUYS ARE WONDERING IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE SHOW, "ENTOURAGE" IT'S ALWAYS BEHIND THE SCENES HOLLYWOOD. EVERYONE, THE ENTOURAGE IS AROUND YOUR CHARACTER. AND YOU GO AROUND HOLLYWOOD AND -- IS THE PARTIES YOU GO TO. IT'S THE CRAZINESS YOU GET INVOLVED INTO. BUT I LOVE AS A FAN OF MOVIES AND SHOW BUSINESS IN GENERAL, ALL THE STUDIOS, DID YOU SHOOT THEM AT REAL STUDIOS?
YEAH, EVERYTHING LOCATION IS THE REAL PLACE.
Jimmy: THE PARAMOUNT LOTS AND WARNER BROTHERS. I REMEMBER AUDITIONING IN THESE PLACES. I'M LIKE, OH MY GOSH. I REMEMBER PULLING INTO PARKING SPACES THERE AND NOT HAVING A A PASS TO GO ON.
AND WE GO TO THE ACTUAL PLACE AND WE BECOME QUITE GOOD AT BEING A LITTLE BREAKAWAY GUERRILLA FILM CREW. WE HAVE TO GO. SOMETIMES JUST THE GUYS AND A A SINGLE CAMERA AND WE'LL DIVE RIGHT IN AND WE'LL START SHOOTING LIKE ON THE RED CARPET OF THE GOLDEN GLOBES, FOR EXAMPLE.
Jimmy: THAT WAS LIKE, HOW DID YOU PULL THAT OFF? I KINDA REMEMBER YOU THERE BUT NOT REALLY.
GUERRILLAS. HE'S FUNNY IN THIS. I LOVE THAT EVERYONE GOT TO ACT. BASICALLY THE IDEA IS, YOU'RE MAKING A BIG BUDGET MOVIE, AND YOU GO WAY OVER BUDGET AND NEED THE HELP OF ARI GOLD TO GET THE MONEY THAT YOU NEED TO FINISH.
IS NOW THE STUDIO HEAD.
Jimmy: IS NOW THE STUDIO HEAD. NOW, HE CAME OUT OF RETIREMENT. AND WE'LL SEE HOW YOU GET INVOLVED.
ALL OF OUR BUTTS ARE ON THE LINE ON THIS ONE. IT'S -- BIG STAKES. HUGE STAKES.
Jimmy: HERE'S ADRIAN GRENIER IN "ENTOURAGE."
VINNY CHASE.
ARI GOLD! VEGAS ODDS HAD YOUR RETIREMENT LASTING LONGER THAN MY MARRIAGE.
WELL, GOOD THING THAT I BET BIG AGAINST BOTH.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH, I'M OKAY. AND YOU, HOW DID YOU GET THE WIFE TO LET YOU GO BACK TO WORK?
ONCE SHE REALIZED THAT SHE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF MILAN WERE SAYING, SHE BEGGED TO GO.
ARI.
I'M NOT GOING BACK TO WORK, VINNIE.
I'M GOING BACK TO BE THE KING OF HOLLYWOOD BUT I AGREED TO LIVE BY ALL OF MY QUEEN'S RULES.
GOOD, I HEAR YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR ME.
SOMETHING BIG. MY FIRST MOVIE AS STUDIO HEAD AND, BOOM, I WANT YOU TO STAR IN IT.
OH YEAH, HOW BADLY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
BECAUSE I DECIDED WHATEVER I DO NEXT, I ALSO WANT TO DIRECT.
DOES HE EVEN KNOW HOW TO DIRECT?
ARI? ARI? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YES.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WE GET PAID TO DO THIS SHOW. THIS IS A JOB.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE THING. IT LOOKS LIKE SO MUCH FUN. I KNOW IT'S WORK BUT, GOSH, TO BE ON A GIANT YACHT WITH ALL THAT PARTYING GOING ON. ALRIGHT, I THINK WE GOT THAT SCENE. WELL, WE'RE STUCK ON THE WATER, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA DO IT.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT. ADRIAN GRENIER, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW.

WOW, THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOW I FEEL BETTER. I WAS SO UPSET TODAY, BECAUSE I MISSED THE MACY'S ONE-DAY SALE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANOTHER ONE UNTIL TOMORROW. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN NOT AGAIN UNTIL THE DAY AFTER THAT. BUT DON'T YOU LOVE IT WHEN THE MACY'S COUPONS COME TO THE HOUSE? 'CAUSE IT'S EXCITING, RIGHT? IT'S LIKE 20% OFF EVERYTHING IN THE STORE EXCEPT LADIES SHOES, LADIES CLOTHES, DIAMONDS, JEWELRY, WATCHES, MEN'S SHOES, MEN'S CLOTHES, LINENS, ANYTHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO BUY. [ APPLAUSE ] IF YOU HAVE AN ERECTION LASTING LONGER THAN FOUR HOURS SEE YOUR DOCTOR. FOUR HOURS, NOT AT THIS AGE. YEAH, I USED TO HAVE SUCH A HIP LIFE YOU KNOW. I STILL TRAVEL THE WHOLE COUNTRY DOING COMEDY. BUT I ALWAYS KNEW WHICH STREET, WHICH ALLEY TO WALK DOWN TO BUY THE BEST POT. I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE. NOW I JUST LEAN ON THE COUNTER AT COSTCO WAITING FOR MY PRESCRIPTIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK GETTING OLDER JUST MEANS YOU START BUYING YOUR DRUGS INDOORS. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE THIS SAME FIGHT WITH MY DRUGGIST I USED TO HAVE WITH MY DEALER. I SAY TO MY DEALER "THAT'S A A DIME BAG OF POT." HE SAYS "IT'S 15." I SAY "IT'S A DIME." NOW I YELL AT THE DRUGGIST. MY CO-PAY IS 10. IT'S 15. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS A KID I TOOK FLINTSTONE'S VITAMINS, NOW I TAKE PROZAC IN THE SHAPE OF MY PARENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I'M IN THE MARKET AND I SEE GINKGO BILOBA AND I THINK "OH, THAT'S THE STUFF THAT'S GOOD FOR YOUR MEMORY." I WANT TO KEEP MY MEMORY, BECAUSE I LIKE HOLDING GRUDGES. SO -- [ LAUGHTER ] I BUY THE GINKGO BILOBA AND I GET IT HOME AND I'M REALLY EXCITED, YOU KNOW. AND I TAKE IT OUT OF THE BAG AND PUT IT ON THE COUNTER NEXT TO 11 UNOPENED JARS OF GINKGO BILOBA. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT MY NEW HOBBY IS? I POUR CUPS OF COFFEE AND I THEN LOOK FOR THEM THE REST OF THE DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] I SAY TO MY HUSBAND "HELP ME FIND MY COFFEE." HE SAYS "HELP ME FIND MY GLASSES, I'LL HELP YOU FIND YOUR COFFEE." I SAY, "THEY'RE ON YOUR HEAD." "IT'S IN YOUR HAND." "GOD BLESS YOU." "HAVE A NICE DAY." [ APPLAUSE ] NOW SOME THINGS CAN GET A A LITTLE BETTER WHEN YOU GET OLDER LIKE SEX, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG SOMETIMES IT'S SO EXCITING, RIGHT? NOT YOU GUYS, BUT SOMETIMES IT COULD BE TOO FAST. NOT YOU GUYS, BUT YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, NO. PERFECT TIMING OVER HERE. SO WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG IT CAN BE TOO FAST. WHEN YOU'RE OLDER, IT'S DIFFERENT. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE OLDER, IT TAKES FOREVER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ANYTHING YET, HUN? NEED ME TO COME BACK IN THE ROOM? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SHOULD I BRING THE MOVIE? EVERYBODY WANTS TO LIVE LONGER. THEY WILL EAT ANYTHING TO LIVE LONGER. BUT I GUARANTEE YOU HERE IS SOMETHING YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ANYBODY SAY, "OH, PLEASE TAKE IT AWAY ALREADY, I CAN'T STOP EATING THAT KALE. THAT KALE IS SO GOOD." NO, IT'S NOT. IT'S PACKING MATERIAL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN'T CHEW KALE. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE STORE I SAID "YOU CAN'T CHEW THIS." HE SAID "YOU HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS?" I SAID, "WHAT, ROLL IT AND SMOKE IT. IS IT PRESCRIPTION KALE?" DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO HAVE KALE IN IT NOW? THERE ARE KALE EVERYTHING. KALE CHIPS, KALE COOKIES, KALE CRACKERS. WHAT KIND OF DOG IS THAT? OH, HE'S A KALE DOODLE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT GOES WITH THE KALE? THE QUINOA. WE HAVE TO HAVE THE QUINOA. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT IS, YOU CAN'T FIND IT IN THE STORE. ASK SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN THE MARKET, "EXCUSE ME, WHERE IS THE QUINOA?" "WHAT." "THE QUINN-O-A?" AISLE 2." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND SUDDENLY THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS GLUTEN INTOLERANT. WHAT'S GLUTEN? DID YOU EVER HEAR THE WORD GLUTEN BEFORE PEOPLE BECAME INTOLERANT OF THE GLUTEN? COULD YOU HAVE PICKED GLUTEN OUT OF A POLICE LINEUP TWO YEARS AGO? MAN THE GLUTEN PEOPLE ARE SO SERIOUS ABOUT IT. HAVE A LITTLE GLUTEN. ARE YOU INSANE? MY UNCLE DIED FROM AN EVERYTHING BAGEL! [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE WORLD HAS GONE FROM SENSITIVE TO INTOLERANT. MAYBE YOU'RE JUST GLUTEN SENSITIVE. NO, I'M INTOLERANT OF THE GLUTEN AND THE LACTOSE AND THE ISRAELIS, AND THE PALESTINIANS, AND THE CARTOONS AND THE DEMOCRATS AND THE REPUBLICANS -- HEY, HEY, HEY, HAVE MY MACY'S COUPON. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE ALL IN THE STORE, WE'RE OVERPAYING FOR LOCALLY SOURCED SUSTAINABLE NON-GMO ORGANIC, ARTISAN FOODS. WE'RE READING THE LABELS, WE'RE TAKING THE PICTURES, WE'RE SPENDING OUR LIVES ON THIS. MEANWHILE OUR PARENTS WALKING AROUND ENJOYING THEMSELVES. THEY'RE EATING FATS, THEY'RE SMOKING CAMELS, THEY'RE DRINKING JACK DANIELS AND THEY BOTH DIE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
