[ LAUGHTER ] BUT SOME MORE TROUBLE FOR OBAMA, POLITICAL REPORTERS ARE COMPLAINING THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN ASKING THEM TO EDIT SOME OF THEIR STORIES TO MAKE THE PRESIDENT LOOK BETTER. THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THAT IS NOT TRUE, AND THOSE REPORTERS SHOULD PLEASE CHANGE WHAT THEY SAY -- OR ELSE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THIS WEEK, VIRGINIA GOVERNOR TERRY MCAULIFFE SAID THAT A NEW SHIPPING LANE IN THE STATE SHOULD BE CALLED THE JOE BIDEN CHANNEL BECAUSE OF BIDEN'S SUPPORT. YEAH.

IN A NEW INTERVIEW, BILL CLINTON SAID THAT RIDING WILD HORSES IN MONGOLIA AND CLIMBING MOUNT KILIMANJARO ARE ON HIS BUCKET LIST. WHEN ASKED WHAT WAS ON HER BUCKET LIST, HILLARY WAS LIKE, "COME ON. GONNA MAKE ME SAY IT? COME ON, YEAH -- YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS."
Steve: YEAH, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING AT THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO JOIN A BROAD COALITION AGAINST EXTREMISTS FROM THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, ISIL. HERE NOW, FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO ELABORATE ON HIS COMMENTS IS PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, JIMMY. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, I WILL NOT HESITATE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST ISIL IN SYRIA. NOW LET ME BE CLEAR -- ALL RIGHT, THESE ARE BAD GUYS. THEY ARE TOTAL, TOTAL ISILS. AND I'VE HAD IT, I HAVE HAD IT WITH THESE ISILS. AND YOU GOTTA REMEMBER, IT'S NOT JUST ISILS IN SYRIA. THERE ARE ISILS EVERYWHERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EVERYONE -- LOOK, EVERYONE KNOWS AN ISIL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER ] ALL THESE PEOPLE TRYING TO BREAK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, MAJOR LEAGUE ISILS. THANK GOD THEY WEREN'T DRINKING, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THERE'S NOTHING WORK THAN A A DRUNKEN ISIL. NOW, LOOK, SOME FOLKS SAY IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO CHANGE THESE PEOPLE, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ALSO SAY, ONCE AN ISIL, ALWAYS AN ISIL. THEY'VE GONE TOO FAR, JUST THEY ARE JUST TOO FAR GONE. ALL RIGHT. AND UH -- HOW CAN I SUM IT UP? TOO FAR GONE, THEY ARE JUST REAL FAR GONE ISILS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, LOOK -- IN CLOSING, GOD BLESS YOU, GOD BLESS ALL OF AMERICA, AND JUST DON'T BE AN ISIL.

Jimmy: WELL, SPEAKING OF LIVE FEEDS, THIS MADE ME LAUGH, DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S U.N. SPEECH YESTERDAY, CNN MADE SURE TO HAVE REPORTERS ON HAND. AND AT FIRST IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, THEY HAD A SPLIT SCREEN, BUT THEN THEY CUT TO WOLF BLITZER. TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE HE IS COMPARED TO THE FIRST REPORTER.
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY UNFORTUNATE POLICY STATEMENT THAT CAME OUT, PERHAPS ACCIDENTALLY BUT WAS REAL -- AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT LEADERS FROM BEHIND ALLOWED THIS VACUUM -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAIT A SECOND. WATCHING IT AGAIN, PAY ATTENTION TO THE PEOPLE IN THE BACKGROUND OVER THEIR SHOULDERS.
-- WAS REAL AND WHAT HAPPENED --
Jimmy: THEY'RE STANDING -- THEY'RE STANDING IN THE SAME LOCATION. YOU DON'T NEED A SPLIT SCREEN, JUST FAKE A WIDER SHOT. THEY ARE STANDING NEXT TO EACH OTHER. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] LET'S GO TO DON LEMON, HE IS STANDING FURTHER AWAY. DON, HOW'S IT GOING? WELL, WOLF, YOU KNOW HOW IT'S GOING. WE'RE IN THE SAME PLACE, SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MARKING THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS THAT BOTH THE YANKEES AND THE RED SOX HAVE MISSED THE POSTSEASON. YEAH, BUT THEIR FANS WERE STILL FIGHTING. THEY'RE LIKE -- HEY, YOU SUCK. BUT NOT AS MUCH AS WE DO. BOSTON FANS ARE LIKE, NO WAY, WE SUCK HARDER THAN YOU DO. WE SUCK. WE SUCK! NO, WE SUCK! SPEAKING OF BOSTON THIS WEEK, HISTORIANS UP THERE DISCOVERED A 113-YEAR-OLD TIME CAPSULE HIDDEN INSIDE A LION STATUE ON TOP OF THE OLD STATE HOUSE. AND NICOLAS CAGE IS ALREADY CALLING HIS AGENT.

I JUST PLAYED AMY DUNNE NOW I NEEDED I THINK AFTER PLAYING ONE OF THE LEAST MATERNAL FIGURES YOU SEE THIS YEAR, I THINK I NEEDED TO GO MAKE A A HUMAN BEING. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS ROLE -- YOU HAVE TO, COME BACK TO BE YOURSELF. EXACTLY. THIS ROLE IS KILLER. IT'S SO GOOD. I LOVE THE BOOK AND I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, THE MOVIE, PLEASE HOLD UP AND GOSH, THE MOVIE HOLDS UP." CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
IT'S SO GOOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: BEYOND THAT, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD -- YOU DON'T WANT TO SPOIL ANYTHING, BUT ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT YOU ARE THE "GONE GIRL."
YES.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANT TO RUIN ANYTHING, 'CAUSE I WANT EVERYONE TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME FUN OF IT ALL.
YES. THE BOOK WAS FANTASTIC. GILLIAN FLYNN, WHO HAS BEEN ON OUR SHOW, SHE WROTE THE BOOK. AND IT'S JUST PHENOMENAL. AND WHEN YOU WATCH IT, YOU GO LIKE THIS IS PERFECT CASTING. BEN HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER. YOU ARE PHENOMENAL. HOW WAS THE AUDITION PROCESS OF THIS? I DID HAVE TO -- WELL, I HAD TO EVENTUALLY FLY TO ST. LOUIS TO MEET DAVID FINCHER, BUT IT STARTED OFF WITH SKYPE CONVERSATIONS AND I WAS FILMING, IT SEEMS ALWAYS HAPPEN THAT I'M VERY POORLY CONNECTED WHEN SOMETHING IMPORTANT HAPPENS.
Jimmy: WERE YOU?
IN THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND WITH NO CELL PHONE RECEPTION, NO SKYPE CONNECTION, SO I HAD TO JOIN A GYM -- I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN JOINING A GYM ANYWAY, I HAD TO JOIN A GYM IN ORDER TO GET AN INTERNET CONNECTION TO SKYPE WITH FINCHER.
Jimmy: SO, WHAT THE, THE GYM HAD INTERNET CONNECTION?
YEAH THE GYM HAD INTERNET CONNECTION.
Jimmy: SO, YOU WOULD GO TO THE GYM?
TAKE MY LAPTOP AND THEN, AS THE CONVERSATIONS GOT SLIGHTLY INTO THE DARKER REALM --
Jimmy: GOING SOMEWHERE?
SO ANYWAY, NEVER WENT ON A A TREADMILL.
Jimmy: NO.
SO INSTEAD I BORROWED ONE OF THE CONFERENCE ROOMS AND I KNEW THAT THE GYM WOULD CLOSE AT 9:30 P.M. I WAS TALKING FROM ENGLAND TO L.A. AND SCOTLAND TO L.A., WE HAD THESE THREE-HOUR CONVERSATIONS, SOMETIMES GETTING VERY, VERY DARK MATERIAL THAT THE FILM INVOLVED AND READING SOME OF THE LINES, WHICH INVOLVED, YOU KNOW, BEING QUITE CANDID AT CAN CERTAIN POINTS BUT SORT OF QUITE --
Jimmy: TRICKY SITUATIONS.
TRICKY SITUATIONS AND SOMETIMES, WELL, ONCE, A VERY TIMID KNOCK AT THE DOOR, AND THEY SAY, "I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, WE ARE TRYING TO CLOSE NOW." AND I SAID, "OH, RIGHT." AND DAVID FINCHER ON THE OTHER END OF THE SKYPE CALL SAID, "YOUR THERAPY SESSION IS OVER." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT DID THEY LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU LEFT? THEY'RE PROBABLY LIKE, "WE DON'T WANT TO -- TAKE THE GYM, TAKE THE TREADMILL, WHATEVER, WHATEVER YOU JUST SAID THIS IN THERE I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING. I SWEAR TO GOD! [SCOTTISH ACCENT] I SWEAR TO GOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT! YOU CAN LEAVE WHENEVER YOU LIKE!
IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THAT I SAID, COULD I -- NO, NO, NO, NO NEED TO EXPLAIN.
Jimmy: BUT THEN WHEN YOU GOT THE ROLE, I LOVE THIS, THERE WAS -- YOU WERE SHOOTING -- WHERE WERE YOU IN NOW?
WE MOVED EVEN SORT OF MORE REMOTE PART OF SCOTLAND IN A A HIGHLAND BEACH WHICH WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET TO BY FOOT OR BY CAR.
Jimmy: AND YOU HAD TO WEAR ALMOST BEEKEEPER HATS WITH THE MESH.
HAD YOU DID YOU KNOW THAT?
Jimmy: BECAUSE THEY ARE CALLED --
THE MIDGETS, SCOTTISH MIDGES, NEVER BEEN TO SCOTLAND, IN EVER GO IN THE SUMMER, I SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I SHOULD BE -- NOW THAT WE STAYED UNITED, I SHOULD BE EX-TOLLING -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: BUT IT HAD IT GONE THE OTHER WAY, WE WOULD HAVE SAID -- YEAH. EXACTLY.
BUT THEY ARE PLAGUED WITH A A BITING INSECT CALLED THE SCOTTISH MIDGE AND THEY COME IN CLOUDS LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE, BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND WHEN YOU ARE ANY PART OF THE SKIN -- OF YOUR SKIN IS EXPOSED, THEY WILL COVER AND EAT YOU ALIVE. SO -- WE WERE FILMING --
Jimmy: GO VISIT SCOTLAND, EVERYBODY. THE BEAUTIFUL -- [ LAUGHTER ] BEAUTIFUL PLACE, HAVE AN INSECT THAT COULD EAT YOUR FACE ALIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?
SO YOU HAVE TO WEAR A SORT OF, I KIND OF HIGHLAND VERSION OF FENCING GEAR, WHICH IS LIKE A SORT OF MESH BALACLAVA.
Jimmy: THERE WAS NO CELL SERVICE?
NO -- THERE WAS NO CELL SERVICE, BUT IT WAS AROUND THE TIME I WAS HEARING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT, YOU KNOW, FINCHER DID WANT TO GO AHEAD WITH HAVING ME IN THIS ROLE. AND THERE WAS A SORT OF VERY REMOTE PART OF THE SET WHERE YOU COULD CLIMB A HILL AND GET MAYBE ONE BAR OF CELL PHONE RECEPTION. AND SOME POINT, I WANDERED UP THERE AND SWITCHED ON MY PHONE AND GOT ONE TEXT SAYING I THINK WE'RE GETTING THE OFFER OF THIS ROLE.
Jimmy: AND YOUR FRIEND TOOK A PHOTO OF YOU AFTER YOU GOT THERE.
THEY DID. YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND I HAVE THE PHOTO. HERE'S YOU GETTING THE CALL THAT YOU GOT "GONE GIRL."
