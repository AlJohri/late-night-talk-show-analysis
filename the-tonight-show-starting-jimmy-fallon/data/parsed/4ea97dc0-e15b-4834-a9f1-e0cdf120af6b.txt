IT WAS ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT IRAN HAS REACHED A DEAL WITH THE U.S. TO LIMIT ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM, AND SEND MOST OF ITS URANIUM TO RUSSIA. AND AMERICANS WERE LIKE, "THAT'S GREAT. WAIT, WHAT?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WAIT, WE'RE SENDING URANIUM TO -- DID YOU SEE THIS ALSO? THE PRESIDENT OF IRAN PREMATURELY ANNOUNCED THE NUCLEAR DEAL ON TWITTER YESTERDAY BEFORE IT WAS OFFICIAL.

WHOA.
Jimmy: POINTED IT AT ME AND TOLD ME TO GET ON THE GROUND. AND I WAS LIKE --
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "IN 25 YEARS, I'M GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT!" [ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT IS GOING ON? I GO, "WHAT?" AND HE LEFT AND TOOK OFF. AND I GO TO MY FRIEND, I GO, "WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT"? AND HE GOES, "SORRY, DUDE, A DRUG DEALER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT." AND HE GOES, "I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT NOW." AND I GO, "OH MY GOD. ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GO HOME, MAN. I MEAN WE'RE NOT GONNA GO TO THE MALL." AND HE GOES, "NO, WE CAN'T, BECAUSE THAT GUY STOLE MY CAR." SO, WE ENDED UP NOT GOING TO THE MALL EITHER. THAT WAS THE REAL BUMMER. THAT WAS THE REAL BUMMER.
MALL BUMMER.
Jimmy: MALL BUMMER. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. AMY, YOU ARE UP.
YOU PICK.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. YEAH, I'LL PICK. I'M GOING TO SAY NUMBER ONE, BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE NUMBER ONE.
THANK YOU.
NICE.
SO ARE YOU. [ CHEERS ] I ONCE HELPED YOKO ONO CROSS THE STREET. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. WAIT A SECOND.
I FIND THAT EXTREMELY PLAUSIBLE.
OKAY.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW IF SHE NEEDS HELP CROSSING THE STREET. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY --.
THAT'S TRUE. SHE'S -- FIT.
Jimmy: PERFECTLY FINE.
SO, WHAT STREET WAS IT? WHAT STREET?
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR HER QUESTION.
WHAT STREET?
IT WAS 66th, LIKE IT WAS AROUND THE PHILLIPS CLUB AREA.
OKAY, OKAY.
Jimmy: PHILLIPS CLUB? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT --.
IT WAS, I DON'T KNOW, UPPER WEST SIDE.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU DO IN THOSE CLUBS?
WEIRD FOR YOU TO BE UPTOWN LIKE THAT.
LOOK FOR PHILLIPS.
WELL, SHE KNOWS THE UPPER WEST SIDE, SHE LIVES OVER THERE, RIGHT? SHE OWNS PART OF CENTRAL PARK. SHE KNOWS HER WAY AROUND.
UH, NO, YOU THOUGH. WHAT WAS YOKO WEARING? WHAT KIND OF BAG?
SHE WAS WEARING A BLACK, LIKE A JACKET, AND A JAUNTY BLACK HAT AND LIKE TINY BLACK JEANS.
WAS SHE WEARING A POLKA DOT JUMPSUIT FROM EXPRESS? DID YOU KNOW YOKO ONO? DID YOU CALL HER -- WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS HER, BUT SHE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND SHE WAS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS DISORIENTED AND I WAS LIKE, "MA'AM, ARE YOU OKAY?" AND THEN I REALIZED IT WAS YOKO ONO. AND SO I KIND OF JUST LIKE LED HER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.
Jimmy: REALLY. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. AND WHAT DID SHE SAY TO YOU? ♪♪
SHE WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND MAYBE IT WAS AN ART PROJECT, BUT I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS WAS JUST LIKE THREE YEARS AGO.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. THREE YEARS AGO. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO, WE'RE OUT OF TIME. THIS IS A TOUGHY, MAN.
IT'S TOUGH, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT COULD BE A LIE. IT COULD BE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU DID, IT COULD BE A LIE THAT SHE'S SOLD VERY, VERY WELL.
Jimmy: EXACTLY, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT I THINK THAT YOU'RE A VERY NICE PERSON AND YOU WOULD HELP SOMEONE ACROSS THE STREET. BUT ALSO AS A FAN OF ART, I THINK YOU WOULD JUST LET THE PIECE PLAY OUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
AW, COME ON!
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.
Jimmy: YEAH. THANK YOU. I AM SUCH A FAN OF ART.
Jimmy: I THINK OF YOU ALL THE TIME AT THE GALLERY. AT THE PHILIPS CLUB.
OH, YOUR ART BLOG.
Jimmy: YOU'RE ALWAYS AT THE PHILIPS CLUB LOOKING AT ART. IS ART HERE? NO, IT'S JUST PHILLIPS ONLY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO SAY THAT'S A LIE.
I'M GONNA AGREE, I THINK IT'S A LIE.
