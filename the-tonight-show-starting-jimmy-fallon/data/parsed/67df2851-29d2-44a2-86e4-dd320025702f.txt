Jimmy: SOMETHING THAT WAS INTERESTING AND WEIRD BUT NOT FUNNY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT HAPPENS A LOT TO ME, RYAN. THAT'S SAD. EVERY TIME YOU COME ON, WE ALWAYS HAVE A GOOD TIME. AND I WAS TALKING TO YOU LAST TIME, BACKSTAGE, AND I SAID, WITH ALL THESE SEASONS OF "AMERICAN IDOL", DO YOU EVER GET THE BUG TO PERFORM? HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO BE A A SINGER OR A PERFORMER?
KIND OF. I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AS I KID. AND THEN I REALIZED, I'M JUST NOT THAT GOOD AT IT. ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFORMANCES, I HAVE THIS GREAT ALBUM CALLED "SLIPPERY WHEN WET" BY BON JOVI --
Jimmy: OH, HELLO, EVERYONE HAS, IT'S THE BEST. THAT'S THE ALBUM TO HAVE.
TOMMY USED TO WORK ON THE DOCK.
Jimmy: UNIONS BEEN ON STRIKE. I DID "LIVING ON A PRAYER" FOR A LIP SYNC THING IN MY HIGH SCHOOL TALENT SHOW.
GINA, SHE'S BEEN WORKING THE DINER ALL DAY.
Jimmy: SHE'S BEEN WORKING AT THE DINER ALL DAY.
WORKING FOR HER MAN.
Jimmy: SHE BRINGS HOME HER PAY.
FOR LOVE.
Jimmy: JUST FOR LOVE.
JUST FOR LOVE, THAT'S ALL.
Jimmy: JUST FOR LOVE. WE GOTTA HOLD ON TO WHAT WE GOT.
SO, I LOVED THAT ALBUM. AND AS A KID I WOULD PERFORM DIFFERENT SONGS FROM THE "SLIPPERY WHEN WET ALBUM." AND ACTUALLY LIKE, DRESSED UP IN MY MONGOOSE BIKER GLOVES AND ACID WASHED DENIM JACKET.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THEN PERFORM IN MY BEDROOM.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU WERE TELLING ME THAT, YOU WOULD LIP SYNC,
WELL, I HAD MY S THE LIGHTS AND CAMERA ON A A TRIPOD. AND WE'D DO A LITTLE, IT WAS LIKE, RYAN SEACREST PRODUCTIONS.
Jimmy: DID YOU A PRODUCTION? YOU HAD THE LIGHTS AND EVERYTHING?
YEAH. VIDEO, WHOLE THING.
Jimmy: YOUR SISTER?
MY SISTER, MEREDITH.
Jimmy: MEREDITH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I KNOW, YEAH, ISN'T THAT WEIRD I KNEW HER NAME?
IT IS WEIRD THAT YOU KNOW MY SISTER'S NAME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, WE TALKED TO YO BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME THE STORY LAST TIME. AND SHE HAS THE VIDEOTAPE. [ CHEERS AND APPLA
SHE HAS THE VIDEOTAPE? SHE FOUND IT?

JUST THE MOST AMAZING SUPERSTAR.
Jimmy: JUST THE BEST, AND IT'S GOOD, AND THE TALENT AND HARRY CONNICK  JR. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT, HE'S A VERY NICE GUY.
YEAH, IF YOU CAN GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT. I CAN'T BELIEVE, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN ON FOR 15 SEASONS AND I HAVE KIDS WHO SAY, I WAS BORN SEASON ONE, AND THEY'RE AUDITIONING TO BE THE WINNER. SO IT'S, YOU WANT TO BE THAT GUY BUT DON'T WANT TO BE THAT GUY. LIKE, YOU'RE GETTING TO BE THE OLD GUY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU WANT TO BE THE GUY THAT'S ON THAT LONG BUT, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE OLD GUY. RIGHT?
