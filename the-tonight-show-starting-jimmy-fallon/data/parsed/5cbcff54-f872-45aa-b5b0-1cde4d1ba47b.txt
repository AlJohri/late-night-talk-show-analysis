Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- AMY SCHUMER, RICHARD LINKLATER, MUSICAL GUEST, ZARA LARSSON, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 453! WOO!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S TOO NICE. THAT'S TOO MUCH. I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, RIGHT HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU MADE IT. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. LOOKING GOOD, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELL, HERE'S WHAT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT. I SAW THAT BILL CLINTON WAS IN THE BRONX CAMPAIGNING FOR HILLARY YESTERDAY, AND HE VISITED THE HEBREW HOME FOR THE AGING. WHILE HILLARY ACTUALLY WENT THERE TO DROP OFF BERNIE SANDERS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO, THEY RAN INTO EACH OTHER. DONALD TRUMP WAS ALSO BUSY CAMPAIGNING HERE IN NEW YORK. AND I NOTICED IN A SPEECH HE GAVE YESTERDAY THAT IT SEEMS LIKE HE DOESN'T EVEN NEED PEOPLE TO COME TO HIS RALLIES ANYMORE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WE LOVE DONALD TRUMP, AND HE'LL PROTECT US, AND HE'LL BE GREAT TO WOMEN. I PROMISE THAT I, ON TUESDAY, WILL VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP AND WILL MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. DONALD, YOU'RE THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN FILL AN ARENA WITHOUT A GUITAR, MEANING WITHOUT MUSIC.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "THAT'S RIGHT! THAT'S WHY I, DONALD TRUMP, AM ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT." [ APPLAUSE ] "DONALD TRUMP IS THE GREATEST DONALD EVER DONALD THE TRUMP." [ LAUGHTER ] CAN'T FORGET ABOUT JOHN KASICH, WHO IS STILL IN THE RACE. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. HE ACTUALLY ATTENDED A TOWN HALL HERE IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT WHERE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT KIDS IN SCHOOL. AND HE HAD SOMETHING PRETTY INTERESTING TO SAY. TAKE A LOOK.
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE YOU CAN FIND IN THE SCHOOL IS THE JANITOR OR THE LUNCH LADY, BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT KIDS FEEL SAFE TALKING TO. AND REVEALING THEIR DEEPEST, DARKEST -- DARKEST KIND OF FEARS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOTHING IS MORE COMFORTING THAN A SCHOOL JANITOR WHO'S LIKE, "TELL ME YOUR DARKEST FEARS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OKAY. WHAT? CALL THE POLICE IF THAT HAPPENS.
Steve: WE SAW HIM WITH THE JANITOR.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THAT STORY AGAIN, JOHN KASICH WAS A NERD IN HIGH SCHOOL, CLEARLY. "WILL YOU GO TO THE PROM WITH ME, LUNCH LADY?" [ LAUGHTER ] IT DOES SEEM LIKE EVERYONE'S WEIGHING IN ON THE ELECTION THESE DAYS. IN FACT, THE DIRECTOR OF THE CIA SAYS THAT NO MATTER WHO THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS, THE AGENCY WILL NOT USE WATERBOARDING EVER AGAIN. YEAH. INSTEAD, HE'S COME UP WITH A A NEW WAY TO TORTURE PEOPLE. TURN OFF THE WIFI WHEN THEY VISIT THEIR PARENTS' HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] CHECK MY TWITTER! OF COURSE, THE BIG ELECTION NEWS TODAY IS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE PAUL RYAN, WHO GAVE A A FORMAL SPEECH TO CLARIFY THAT HE IS DEFINITELY NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AFTER NO ONE BELIEVED HIM THE LAST TIME HE SAID IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CHECK THIS OUT.
WE HAVE TOO MUCH WORK TO DO IN THE HOUSE TO ALLOW THIS SPECULATION TO SWIRL OR TO HAVE MY MOTIVATIONS QUESTIONED. SO LET ME BE CLEAR. I DO NOT WANT, NOR WILL I ACCEPT THE NOMINATION FOR OUR PARTY.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO RUN. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT? [ APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE, TRUMP WAS LIKE, "ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST. EVEN PEOPLE NOT RUNNING ARE DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THIS MADE ME LAUGH. AN ANALYST FOR MSNBC TRIED TO DRAW A MAP OF AMERICA TO HELP EXPLAIN THE ELECTION TO HIS VIEWERS. BUT LOOKED LIKE HE DREW SOMETHING ELSE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET THIS HERE.
WORK YOUR MAGIC.
LOOK AT THE STATES THAT ARE GOING TO COME. IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY WORK, THERE.
IT'S GOOD, IT'S A BLANK SLATE. WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT TO DO.
ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO? I'M GONNA DRAW A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES HERE. THIS IS MY CRUDE VERSION OF A A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES. NOW, HERE'S THE THING. HOW'S THIS PLAY OUT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HONEY, PUT THE KIDS TO SLEEP.
Steve: THAT'S NUTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NO -- IT'S MORE THAN THAT. MORE THAN THAT. MORE THAN THAT. ♪♪

Steve: THE STAFF IS HERE. HE'S BEEN DEBRIEFED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. YOU THINK THEY'D INVEST IN A A MAP AT THAT NETWORK. WHATEVER. THIS IS NOT GOOD HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] A STARBUCKS CUSTOMER IN FLORIDA WAS JUST IN THE NEWS BECAUSE APPARENTLY, WHEN HE ORDERED A A GRANDE WHITE MOCHA, THE BARISTA LABELED IT, "DIABETES, HERE I COME." ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT "DIABETES, HERE I COME" EVER HAD HIS NAME SPELLED CORRECTLY ON A A STARBUCKS CUP. [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S A TRICKY NAME. NOT THAT COMMON OF A NAME. THIS IS INTERESTING. RESEARCHERS IN CALIFORNIA FOUND THAT 74% OF MOTHERS CONFESS THAT THEY LIKE ONE CHILD BETTER THAN ANOTHER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ONE MOTHER SAID, "DON'T USE MY NAME, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT JEB TO FIND OUT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I READ THAT HOARDING IS GETTING WORSE IN THE U.S. HOARDING. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, HOARDING.
Steve: OH.
Jimmy: HOARDING IS GETTING WORSE IN THE U.S. AND AFFECTS OVER 15 MILLION AMERICANS. OF COURSE, IT MIGHT BE HIGHER NOW, BECAUSE I READ THAT IN A A NEWSPAPER THAT I'VE BEEN SAVING SINCE 2003. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] BUT I MEAN -- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO PUT DOWN IF I PAINT THE HOUSE?
Steve: YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT.
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, HERE'S A A LOCAL STORY HERE. ROBBERS DRILLED A HOLE THROUGH A BANK CEILING IN BROOKLYN OVER THE WEEKEND AND STOLE MORE THAN $280,000. POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO KNOWS BROOKLYN AND HAS A A REASON TO ATTACK BANKS. AND -- OH, MY GOD, IT WAS BERNIE SANDERS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY.
