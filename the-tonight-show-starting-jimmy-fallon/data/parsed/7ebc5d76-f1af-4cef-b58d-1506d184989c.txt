Jimmy: WELL, IT WAS THE FIRST TWO TIMES.
OH, I SEE.
Jimmy: EXACTLY.
STOP BEING LOVELY.
Jimmy: I WANTED TO ASK YOU REALLY QUICKLY BEFORE WE GET INTO THE MUSICAL, YOU DID STAND-UP RECENTLY.
YOU KNOW, I DID. I DID A LITTLE SAMPLE OF STAND-UP WITH JERRY SEINFELD. I THINK THAT'S HOW IT'S PRONOUNCED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S HOW IT'S PRONOUNCED.
AND I ACTUALLY DO ENJOY DOING STAND-UP, ESPECIALLY NOW BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, LIFE IS SO BUSY AND IT'S SO HECTIC. AND WITH STAND-UP, I CAN JUST GO OUT AND RELAX AND ENJOY THE SILENCE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAS IT FUN?
IT WAS REALLY FUN. I WAS REALLY FLATTERED AT FIRST, THAT JERRY ASKED ME TO OPEN THE SHOW FOR HIM. AND THEN, I FOUND OUT HE CONSIDERED IT A DOUBLE BLIND COMEDY TEST AND I WAS THE PLACEBO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: UNBELIEVABLE.
NOW, DO YOU THINK THAT JOKE WORKED? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LET ME ASK THE AUDIENCE. IF YOU THOUGHT IT WORKED, APPLAUD, I SEE THAT IT DIDN'T WORK. IF YOU THINK IT WORKED? [ APPLAUSE ] HOW MANY THOUGHT IT DIDN'T WORK? [ LIGHT APPLAUSE ] OKAY, WELL, I THOUGHT IT DIDN'T WORK, ACTUALLY. BUT BEFOREHAND, I PUT RESPONSES IN THESE ENVELOPES FOR MARTY SHORT AND JERRY AND MYSELF JUST TO SEE, BECAUSE WE HAD, YOU KNOW, IT'S A DIFFICULT JOKE. AND HERE'S -- I CHECKED, OF COURSE, WILL WORK, OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T DO IT. MARTY SAID, WON'T WORK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND LET'S SEE WHAT JERRY SAID. THESE ARE GREAT COMEDY MINDS. COMPLETE DISASTER. SORRY TO MONOPOLIZE.
Jimmy: NO, NO IT WAS VERY -- IT IS FUN TO SEE THAT. I LOVED YOUR STAND-UP. I WANTED TO SEE IT. I WISH WITH YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT I ALWAYS LOVED ABOUT COMEDY. I'M SORRY TO GO ON. WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THIS MUSICAL. I KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY IN IT AND EVERYTHING.
TALK MORE SO I DON'T HAVE TO. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] I LOVE COMEDIANS' OPENING LINES BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE REALLY IMPORTANT. I REMEMBER I SAW RICHARD PRYOR ONCE. AND IT WAS IN THE EARLY '70s. AND HE WAS NOTORIOUSLY KIND OF CRAZY AT THAT TIME, IN A GOOD WAY. AND HE WAS GOING TO DO TWO SHOWS AT THE TROUBADOUR. ONE AT 8:00 AND ONE AT 10:00. AND HE SHOWS UP AT 9:30 AND HE DOES ONE SHOW. BUT I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, BEGINNING COMEDIAN, I THOUGHT THIS AUDIENCE IS REALLY GOING TO BE MAD AT HIM FOR BEING SO LATE. BUT THEY WEREN'T. THEY LOVED HIM. AND HIS OPENING LINE WAS, HOPE I'M FUNNY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TO WAIT THAT LONG, YEAH, IT BETTER BE FUNNY.
I REMEMBER I SAW SAM KINISON ONE TIME AND HIS OPENING LINE WAS THIS WAS AT THE COMEDY STORE AND THERE WERE A LOT OF COMEDIANS. HE SAID, YOU SAW A LOT OF COMEDIANS TONIGHT. THIS IS OPEN. SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY FUNNY, SOME WERE PRETTY GOOD, BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND ME. THEM YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE AGAIN SOME TIME.
Jimmy: AND THEN HE WAS SAM KINISON. WHAT WAS YOUR OPENING LINE?
I HAD SEVERAL. BUT THE ONE I SORT OF ENDED UP WITH. I'D GO OUT AND SAY, GOOD EVENING, IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. NO, IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. NO, NO IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU, BOTH FOR BEING HERE. I'M SORRY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS. THIS IS SO EXCITING AND THANKS THE CAST IS HERE TONIGHT. YOU HAVE A SHOW ON BROADWAY GUYS.
WE DO. AND IT'S IN PREVIEWS NOW.
Jimmy: HOW EXCITING IS THAT? IS IT COOL? IS IT OVERWHELMING? IS IT WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS?
IT'S SO OVERWHELMING THAT WHEN I'M THERE, IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE OCEAN ROAR IN MY EARS. EVERYTHING IS LIKE A SEA SHELL UP TO MY --
I THINK OF IT AS THE APEX OF MY CAREER. WRITTEN WITH EDIE BRICKELL, THIS MUSICAL THAT REALLY SEEMS TO BE GOING WELL.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: SO MUCH WORK GOES INTO THESE THINGS. LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF EVEN PEOPLE REALIZE 'CAUSE YOU SEE THE SHOW AND YOU GO OH, THAT LOOKS LIKE SO MUCH FUN. BUT IT'S SO MUCH WORK.
SO MUCH WORK. WE'RE GOING ON FOUR YEARS WORKING ON IT NOW. WE DID IT IN SAN DIEGO AT THE OLD GLOBE THEATER. I'M SORRY, YOU'RE HERE. YOU TALK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
IT'S THE BEST KIND OF WORK, THOUGH. IT FEELS LIKE PLAY BECAUSE YOU GET TO -- WHEN YOU LOVE YOUR WORK, IT IS LIKE PLAY. AND OUR COLLABORATIVE TEAM, THE MOST TALENTED AND FUN LOVING PEOPLE. AND THEY PUT ALL THEIR SKILL, ALL THEIR HEARTS INTO EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE OFFERING AND THEY MAKE IT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BETTER. AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO EXCITING IN MY WHOLE LIFE.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
AND THE, YOU KNOW, THE TALENT IN THE CAST -- FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE A -- I CAN'T MENTION EVERYBODY'S NAME, BUT THE CAST IS SO TALENTED. TO HEAR YOUR SONGS THAT WE WROTE TOGETHER, EDIE WROTE THE LYRICS. SUNG BY THESE PEOPLE, SOME OF THEM MEN. AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD OUR SONGS BY A MAN SINGING. AND IT'S JUST THRILLING TO HEAR THE SONGS.
Jimmy: HOW DOES IT ALL START? YOU STARTED WRITING ONE SONG TOGETHER ON AN ALBUM YOU WERE DOING? HOW DID IT BEGIN?
THE ONE SONG, THE VERY FIRST BANJO MELODY AND COMPOSITION THAT STEVE SENT TO ME I HEARD IT AND I WAS INSPIRED TO SING, "THE SUN'S GONNA SHINE AGAIN." AND THAT'S THE SONG THAT OUR MUSICAL CAST IS ABOUT TO SING FOR YOU GUYS TONIGHT.
WELL, NOT ABOUT TO, BUT IN A A BIT.
WE HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME.
Jimmy: NO. NOT GOING TO BE A LONG TIME, BUT IT'S FUN. I WOULD BE NERVOUS IF I WENT AND DID THIS AND I WROTE THIS AND THEN YOU'RE WATCHING AND YOU GO SOME BITS WORK, SOME BITS DON'T.
THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED TAKING THE SHOW OUT OF TOWN. YOU GET TO SEE IT. WE DID IT IN SAN DIEGO. THE AUDIENCE WAS REALLY KIND. YOU THINK ABOUT IT AT NIGHT AND YOU START TO REARRANGE THINGS. WE DID IT IN D.C. AT THE KENNEDY CENTER AND IT'S BETTER AND IT'S SHAPED MORE. THEN WE MAKE A FEW CHANGES HERE AND THERE. NEW JOKES, NEW LINES.
NEW SONGS.
NEW SONGS.
Jimmy: REALLY? NEW SONGS AS WELL.
MIKE NICHOLS TOLD ME ONCE, NEVER GO TO THE BIRTHDAY PARTY OF SOMEONE WHO HAS WRITTEN A A MUSICAL. AND I SAID, WHY? AND HE SAID, BECAUSE THEY'LL PLAY YOU EVERY SONG THAT WAS CUT FROM THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S LIKE AN ALBUM RIGHT THERE. WHAT'S THIS PLAY ABOUT? CAN YOU SAY WHAT IT'S ABOUT?
WELL, YOU KNOW KIND OF A A LITTLE BIT OF A MYSTERY. IT'S NOT A DEEP MYSTERY OR ANYTHING. BUT SO I NEVER KNOW WHAT TO TELL. BUT I'LL SAY BRIEFLY, IT'S SET IN 1920s AND THE 1940s. AND IT TELLS A STORY OF A A WOMAN'S LIFE AND A SECRET THAT BECOMES REVEALED TO HER THROUGHOUT THE SHOW.
Jimmy: I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT.
AND THERE'S SO MANY COLORFUL, WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN HER LIFE. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL ENSEMBLE CAST AND EVERYBODY IS VERY POWERFUL.

AND I'M PLAYING SERIOUS GLASWEGIAN IN THIS FILM. VERY, VERY, VERY SCOTTISH IN THIS FILM. AND SO DOING "TAKE ON ME" PRETENDING TO BE DRUNK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IN FRONT OF A A LOT OF DISINTERESTED EXTRAS WAS VERY HUMILIATING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I'M NOT EASILY EMBARRASSED.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I WAS TRULY DYING, DYING INSIDE.
Jimmy: WHY?
I DON'T REALLY KNOW. LIKE TAKE FOUR, I WAS JUST LIKE LOOKING AROUND, PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY GIVE A [ BLEEP ]. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LOOKED OVER AT TINA, SHE DIDN'T GIVE A [ BLEEP ] EITHER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN FORTUNATELY, JOHN AND GLENN, THE DIRECTORS WERE SO POSITIVE. I THINK THEY SAW THAT I WAS CAVING IN. AND I WANTED TO LEAVE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I WANTED TO SORT OF LEAVE THE ARENA. AND THEY WERE LIKE -- I WENT BACK TO MY TRAILER AND THEY BROUGHT ME A LITTLE KARAOKE SET, YOU KNOW. JUST AS A KIND OF COMRADELY GESTURE.
Jimmy: YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DRUNK SINGING. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SOUND GOOD.
NO, I DON'T. BUT I THINK, I FELT I WASN'T ACTING GOOD. AND THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS A DIFFERENT THING.
Jimmy: SEE, IF EDIE HAD TO DO KARAOKE AND SHE DIDN'T SOUND GOOD, THAT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING.
OF COURSE.
Jimmy: SHE'S EDIE BRICKELL.
OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
Jimmy: BUT YEAH, YOU ARE --
I'M CERTAINLY ALLOWED TO SING BADLY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I DON'T MIND SINGING BADLY, BUT IF YOU KIND OF, ACT IN A WAY THAT YOU THINK IS NOT GREAT, THAT'S NOT A GOOD FEELING.
Jimmy: YEAH. WELL, ACTING DRUNK. I DO IT EVERY NIGHT ON THE SHOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: WORKED FOR ME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP OF THE MOVIE. HERE IS YOU AND TINA FEY. THIS IS YOU HAVE KIND OF A A DRUNKEN NIGHT TOGETHER.
KISSY TIME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, KISSY TIME. THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL TITLE OF THE FILM.
IT WAS. KISSY TIME. WE AGONIZED OVER THAT.
Jimmy: AND YOU CHANGED IT TO "WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT."
MISTAKE.
Jimmy: BUT IT WAS "KISSY TIME." ANYWAYS, HERE'S MARTIN FREEMAN AND TINA FEY IN "WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT" TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
LIKE A GOOD SHAG.
OKAY, LET'S TRY TO BE ADULTS HERE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE.
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS JUST A A KA-BUBBLE THING, RIGHT?
NOPE, THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS.
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE GALLANT.
I'M SERIOUS. I FANCY YOU. KIM BAKER. I DO. ALONG WITH DOZENS OF WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY, ACTUALLY, YES.
NO, YOU DIDN'T. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT ME. I WOULD NEVER DO THIS.
PRECISELY. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT YOU ANYMORE. YOU'RE IN THE KA-BUBBLE. YOU SAID IT YOURSELF. DON'T.
