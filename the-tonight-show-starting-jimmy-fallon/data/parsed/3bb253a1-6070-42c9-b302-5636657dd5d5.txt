Questlove: 437, T-O! WOO!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, COME ON! THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, RIGHT THERE. THAT'S A HOT CROWD RIGHT THERE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. OH! GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE, YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE AT THE SHOW. WELCOME. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HISTORIC VISIT TO CUBA THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. I SAW THAT AFTER LANDING YESTERDAY, OBAMA IMMEDIATELY TWEETED OUT, "WHAT'S UP, CUBA?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND CUBANS OPENED UP A WINDOW AND YELLED, "WE DON'T HAVE THE INTERNET! [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE 1955 HERE! [ APPLAUSE ] SEE MY CAR? YOU THINK I HAVE A SMARTPHONE?" MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THAT RAUL CASTRO DISRESPECTED THE PRESIDENT BY NOT GREETING HIM AT THE AIRPORT. SERIOUSLY? OUR COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN ENEMIES FOR 60 YEARS. I CAN'T EVEN GET MY BEST FRIEND TO PICK ME UP AT THE AIRPORT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO ONE'S GOING TO PICK YOU UP AT THE AIRPORT. NO, NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT, SORRY. MEANWHILE, MITT ROMNEY ANNOUNCED ON FACEBOOK THAT HE WILL VOTE FOR TED CRUZ OVER DONALD TRUMP IN TOMORROW'S UTAH CAUCUS -- [ SCATTERED CHEERS ] -- BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BELIEVE JOHN KASICH CAN ACTUALLY WIN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND IF THERE'S ONE THING ROMNEY'S AN EXPERT ON, IT'S NOT WINNING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO, I MEAN -- HE KNOWS HIS STUFF.
Steve: HE KNOWS HIS STUFF.
Jimmy: HE KNOWS HIS STUFF.
Steve: 47% OF IT.
Jimmy: A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINK JOHN KASICH WOULD MAKE A GOOD PICK FOR VICE PRESIDENT. BUT KASICH SAID IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY THAT HE WILL NOT BE VICE PRESIDENT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. WHEN HE HEARD THAT JOE BIDEN WAS LIKE, "SERIOUSLY? I DID IT FOR A $20 GIFT CARD TO GAMESTOP." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FANTASTIC. JOHN KASICH HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PRETTY VOCAL IN HIS CRITICISM OF TRUMP'S ANTICS. HE ALSO SAID TRUMP SHOULD REMEMBER THAT HE'S NOT "RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE WWE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH. AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE. YOU KNOW, UNTIL THEY SAW THIS.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, BEN?
YOU WANT SOME OF THIS TONIGHT?
YOU WANT SOME? YOU WANT SOME? COME ON UP HERE.
HEY, HEY! OH, MY! KING! OH, MY GOD!
HEY, LOOK AT THIS! DONALD TRUMP! DONALD TRUMP! [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT?
Steve: OH, MY --
Jimmy: I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THAT VIDEO'S IN THE TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY ONE DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT SHOULD BE GOOD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL. OH FRIDAY, HULK HOGAN WAS AWARDED $115 MILLION IN A A LAWSUIT AGAINST GAWKER FOR POSTING A VIDEO OF HIS SEX TAPE. GAWKER'S LAWYERS SAY THEY ARE APPEALING, WHICH IS MORE THAN YOU CAN SAY FOR THE HULK HOGAN SEX TAPE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY!
Jimmy: AND POPE FRANCIS LAUNCHED HIS INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT ON SATURDAY, AND HIS FIRST POST WAS A PICTURE OF HIMSELF WITH A A CAPTION, "PRAY FOR ME." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH. TWO DAYS ON INSTAGRAM AND THE POPE IS ALREADY WRITING VAGUE POSTS JUST TO GET SOME SYMPATHY LIKES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "HAVING A ROUGH TIME, CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT." [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S WRONG, DUDE?
Steve: WHAT'S UP, POPE.
Jimmy: NO, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, MAN.
Steve: OH, COME ON. PLEASE.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. IT'S NO BIG DEAL. JUST NEVER MIND. [ LAUGHTER ] SORRY I BROUGHT IT UP. PICTURE OF A SUNSET.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: MOOD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HEY, I TOTALLY GOT AN EMOJI.
Jimmy: DID YOU SEE THIS? NASA ASTRONAUT JEFF WILLIAMS JUST LEFT EARTH ON A SIX-MONTH MISSION THAT WILL ALLOW HIM TO SURPASS THE RECORD FOR MOST TIME IN SPACE SET BY SCOTT KELLY. THE MEN SAID IT'S NOT A A COMPETITION, THEY BOTH HATE THEIR FAMILIES EQUALLY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK I LEFT MY WALLET BACK UP IN THE SPACE STATION, SO I GOT TO GO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: BYE!
Jimmy: BYE! THAT'S WHAT SCOTT KELLY SAID?
Steve: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID ON HIS WAY OUT. BYE!
Jimmy: BYE! YEAH, I LEFT MY WALLET UP THERE. BYE! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS INTERESTING. A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT THE SOUND YOU MAKE WHILE CHEWING CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FOOD YOU EAT.

HE HAD A COVER OF "MEN'S FITNESS," "MEN'S HEALTH," "MUSCLE AND FITNESS," ONE OF THOSE MAGAZINES. AND I SAW IT AND SAID, "OH, WHEN OUR MOVIE COMES OUT THEY SHOULD PUT US BOTH ON THE COVER." THAT WAS IT, THAT WAS ALL THAT HAPPENED. BUT THEN AFTER THE WEDDING AT THE RECEPTION I HEAR LIKE, "PEE-WEE, PEE-WEE!" I TURN AROUND. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IS COMING TOWARDS ME. HE'S GOING I WANT YOU TO MEET MY GIRLFRIEND. AND HE WALKS UP TO ME, AND HE SAYS, I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO BE IN THE MAGAZINE. YOU PROBABLY DO HIM WAY BETTER THAN ME.

I GO -- I ALMOST LET OUT A A SQUEAL LIKE A PIG. IT WAS SO -- IT CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD. IT WAS SO WEIRD. NO ONE'S EVER DONE THAT TO ME EVER, IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
