Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME. [ CHEERS ] WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYONE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU GUYS MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE SAFE. YOU'RE WARM. THIS IS THE SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND YOU'RE WATCHING FROM HOME. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. GUYS, I'M YOUR HOST JIMMY FALLON. GUYS, WE HAVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MARCO RUBIO ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND TO MAKE MARCO FEEL COMFORTABLE DURING THE INTERVIEW, WE HAVE FIVE OTHER GUYS WHO ARE GOING TO INTERRUPT HIM EVERY TIME HE TALKS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "MY TURN." "OKAY, MY TURN." [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S THE LATEST ON THE ELECTION, YOU GUYS. AT A DONALD TRUMP RALLY IN OKLAHOMA, SARAH PALIN CALLED PRESIDENT OBAMA A WEAK-KNEED CAPITULATOR IN CHIEF. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED IF SHE KNOWS WHAT A A CAPITULATOR IS, SHE SAID "OF COURSE I DO, IT'S ONE OF THOSE WORMS THAT TURN INTO A A BUTTERFLY." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] YEAH, SURE. THIS WEEK, THE MANAGER OF A A PIZZA RESTAURANT IN IOWA PUT UP A SIGN THAT SAID DONALD TRUMP COULD EAT FOR FREE, BUT TRUMP NEVER SHOWED UP. [ LAUGHTER ] SHORTLY AFTER, THOUSANDS OF RESTAURANTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY PUT UP SIGNS SAYING DONALD TRUMP COULD EAT FOR FREE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS ODD. WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? THEY'RE HOPING THAT HE WOULD COME BY.
Steve: CHRIS CHRISTIE, I KNOW.
Jimmy: CHECK THIS OUT. A NEW "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE PROFILE ON BERNIE SANDERS SAID THAT HE STILL DOES HIS OWN GROCERY SHOPPING. GROCERY SHOPPING USUALLY TAKES BERNIE A WHILE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS STOPS FOR AN HOUR TO YELL AT THE 1% MILK. [ LAUGHTER ] "WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER 99%? NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THAT MILK. NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THE 99% MILK THAT YOU SHOULD BE DRINKING." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THE ARTICLE ALSO SAID THAT BERNIE SANDERS' SON CALLS HIS DAD THE BERNSTER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHILE JEB BUSH'S SON CALLS HIM "MY MOM'S FRIEND, JEB." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S SAD. YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT. COLD. GUYS, I SAW THAT A NEW AD FROM BERNIE SANDERS USES MUSIC FROM SIMON AND GARFUNKEL. AT FIRST, PEOPLE WONDERED HOW THEY GOT THE RIGHTS, AND THEN THEY LOOKED AT OLD PHOTOS AND REALIZED BERNIE SANDERS MIGHT BE GARFUNKEL. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE NOT SURE. [ APPLAUSE ] WE'RE FINDING OUT NOW. WE'RE FINDING OUT NOW. WE'RE STILL FINDING OUT. WE'RE STILL FINDING OUT.
Steve: THEY DON'T KNOW YET? THEY'RE STILL LOOKING.
Jimmy: GUYS, LISTEN TO THIS, THE WHITE HOUSE JUST ANNOUNCED NEW GUIDELINES THAT SAY DOCTORS MUST LET PATIENTS SEE THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS IF THEY REQUEST THEM. AND DOCTORS ARE LIKE "JUST SO YOU GUYS KNOW, 'LARD ASS' IS A A MEDICAL TERM. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO -- IT MEANS HEALTHY BUTT." AND GET THIS, A LEAKED MEMO REVEALED THAT ESPN TOLD ITS REPORTERS AND ANNOUNCERS NOT TO MAKE POLITICAL COMMENTS ON AIR. SEEMS WEIRD, BUT LOOKING AT A A FEW GAMES THEY'VE AIRED RECENTLY, YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE PROBLEM IS COMING FROM.
GREEN HOLDS ON TO IT. GOOD HANDS. HE PASSES IT ON AHEAD. IGUODALA, SLAM DUNK. OBAMA'S NOT MY PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: NO, YEAH. YOU GOTTA -- LISTEN TO IT AGAIN LATER. YOU CAN HEAR IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, THE OTHER BIG STORY RIGHT NOW IS WINTER STORM JONAS, WHICH COULD DROP OVER TWO FEET OF SNOW ON PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST. METEOROLOGISTS SAY WINTER STORM JONAS WASN'T THAT STRONG UNTIL IT LEFT ITS BROTHERS JOE AND KEVIN. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, UNSTOPPABLE. [ APPLAUSE ] HIT AFTER HIT AFTER HIT. I MEAN, UNSTOPPABLE. LITTLE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS HERE. I SAW THAT JENNIFER LAWRENCE IS SET TO STAR IN A BIOPIC ABOUT A A SPY WHO BECAME FIDEL CASTRO'S LOVER IN THE LATE '50s. I WON'T SPOIL WHY THEY BROKE UP. LET'S JUST SAY HE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: ZOINK! RINK! RONK! [ LAUGHTER ]

THANK YOU. Jimmy: APPRECIATE IT. NEW YORK CITY H MEANING FOR YOU.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BECAUSE --
I GOT ENGAGED HERE.
Jimmy: YEAH. WHAT'S THE STORY BEHIND THAT ONE? YEAH.
IT WAS LIKE A LONG TIME AGO, BUT IT WAS -- YES. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT WAS A GOOD. IT WAS A GOOD THING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO WE CAME HERE ON VALENTINE'S DAY IN 1997, AND I TOLD MY -- I WANTED TO PROPOSE TO HER ON TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. SHE LIKED "SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE," IS THAT THE NAME OF IT?
Jimmy: SURE, YEAH. GREAT MOVIE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S GREAT MOVIE.
YEAH, I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT INSOMNIA, BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S LIKE A -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO THAT'S WHERE THEY GET YOU. YEAH.
IT WAS COLD. AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO UP THERE TO THE TOP SO I HAD TO FIGURE OUT QUICKLY, LIKE, HOW AM I GONNA GET HER UP THERE.
Jimmy: SHE DIDN'T' WANNA DO TO THE TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING?
NO, IT WAS COLD. AND WE'RE FROM FLORIDA. SO IT WAS LIKE 40s. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT EVEN COLD. YEAH.
SO WE WANNA GO UP THERE. SO, I FINALLY CONVINCED HER, I SAID, "LOOK, AS A CHILD, I ALWAYS LOVED KING KONG. REMEMBER KING KONG WAS ON TOP OF THE BUILDING?" SHE'S LIKE, "THAT'S NOT EVEN A A REAL STORY." I GO, "I KNOW BUT I LIKED IT. LET'S GO." SO I GOT HER UP THERE, I PROPOSED AND THEN I WAS AFRAID -- I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WAS THIS THING, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DROP THE RING OFF THE SIDE. SO I GRABBED THE RING BACK AND GAVE IT BACK TO HER WHEN WE GOT TO THE BOTTOM. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS JUST WORRIED I WOULD LOSE THE RING, LIKE, IT WOULD FALL OFF THE SIDE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND IT.
Jimmy: JUST DON'T GO TO THE EMPIRE STATE BUILD
IT'S IN NEW YORK GONNA FIND IT.
Jimmy: THIS IS L
I KNOW. BUT THAT'S WHER "SLEEPLESS IN THEY SH BY, YOU KNOW, SOMEWHERE FLATTER. [ LAUGHTE
Jimmy: YOU JUST G RENTING OTHER MOVIES. BUT I MEAN YOU'RE HAPPILY MARRIED. YOU GOT FOUR GREAT KIDS, RI
THEY THE SHOW. THEY SAID, "THEY'RE GOING TO BOO AT YOU, DAD, THEY'RE GOING TO BOO AT YOU WHEN YOU WA OUT." [ AUDIENCE AWS ] AND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. THAT'S GOOD.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T BOO ANYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY CAN.
NO, NO, NO.
Jimmy: THEY CAN IF YOU WANT THEM TO. I MEAN, WE -- > ANYBODY. BUT NOW THEY CAN'T WATCH THE SHOW TONIGHT BECAUSE SEGMENT WAS KIND OF -- THE QUESTION THING. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN THERE WAS A COUPLE POINTS THERE WHERE I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IN THE DVR OR SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'LL SEND YOU A CLIP OF THIS.
YEAH, JUST SEND THIS CLIP.
Jimmy: YEAH. CAUSE THEY ANYWA
AND L TOO, YEAH.
Jimmy: LEAVE O
YEAH.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T > THINK ONE OF THEM MIGH BOUGHT IT FOR ME.
Jimmy: REALLY LIKE THE BOOTS.
OH, YOU DID?
Jimmy: YEAH. I'M NOT MAKING FUN OF THE BOOTS.
NO, I THOUGHT IT WAS A A COMEDY SHOW. I DIDN'T KNOW. I THOUGHT WE'RE -- OKAY. [ LAUGH
Jimmy: YOU'RE GONNA GET BOOTS. [ LAUGHTER YOU KEEP THIS U YOU KEEP THIS UP ACTUALLY REALLY DO ENJOY THE BOOTS. I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD WEAR THEM.
I'M ACTUALLY TIRED OF TALKING ABOUT [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I THINK IT'S GIFT. I ACTUALLY DO FIND THEM VERY COMFORTABLE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR MESSAGE IS, DO YOU WANT TO LET EVERYONE KNOW WHY YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?
YEAH. WELL, OBVIOUSLY THIS COUNTRY'S CHANGED THE HISTORY OF MY FAMILY. MY PARENTS CAME HERE, ACTUALLY TO NEW YORK IN 1956 AND MY DAD STOPPED GOING TO SCHOOL WHEN HE WAS 9 YEARS-OLD BECAUSE HIS MOM DIED, SO THEIR WHOLE LIFE THEY KIND OF STRUGGLED, THEY WORKED HARD. THEY WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WHAT I CALL THE AMERICAN DREAM. YOU KNOW, THEY WERE ABLE TO OWN A HOME AND RAISE THEIR KIDS. AND I JUST WANT THIS TO REMAIN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY. I WANT IT TO REMAIN A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN DO FOR THEIR KIDS WHAT MY PARENTS WERE ABLE TO DO FOR ME. AND I'M AFRAID WE'RE LOSING THAT. IF YOU GO AROUND THE COUNTRY YOU SEE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WILL TELL YOU WE'RE WORKING HARDER THAN WE EVER WORKED YET WE CAN'T SEEM TO GET AHEAD. SO THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME. SO WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO SAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM, I WANT TO EXPAND IT TO REACH MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER.
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT IS YOUR TRAGEDY GOING INTO THIS? BECAUSE, I MEAN, DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LEADING, RIGHT, IN THE POLLS?
WHO'S THAT? [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: YEAH. AND TED CRUZ.
YEAH. I KNOW HIM.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU KNOW HIM AS WELL.
UH-HUH.
Jimmy: JEB. YOU KNOW JEB VERY WELL.
I KNOW HIM.
Jimmy: IS THAT AWKWARD FOR YOU, YOU AND JEB TO BE DEBATING?
WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE UP THERE, TOO.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT I MEAN YEAH. WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A A LONG TIME. WE JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE, LIKE, RUN FOR PRESIDENT AT THE SAME TIME, SO, BUT - - [ LAUGHTER ]
