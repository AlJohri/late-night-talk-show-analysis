Jimmy: I WAS GONNA BET ON SEPP BLATTER.
Steve: DID YOU REALLY?
Jimmy: NOT REAL. ACTUALLY, LINCOLN CHAFEE IS THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND, AND HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THIS WEEK. AND GET THIS, AFTER HIS ANNOUNCEMENT HE GOT 27,000 COMMENTS ON FACEBOOK. COMPARED TO HILLARY CLINTON'S ANNOUNCEMENT, WHICH GOT 10 MILLION.

MEANWHILE, RICK PERRY BECAME THE TENTH REPUBLICAN TO ANNOUNCE HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT YESTERDAY. THE CROWD AT HIS SPEECH WAS PRETTY EXCITED TO HAVE HIM BACK IN THE RACE AGAIN, BUT I THINK THEY WERE MORE IMPRESSED BY SOME OF HIS CREDENTIALS THAN OTHERS. WATCH THIS.

ONE OF THEM GOT REAL, REAL UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
HE SHOWERED ON HIS OWN. HE WAS STANDING, YOU KNOW OUTSIDE THE SHOWER. HE WALKED TO HIS LOCKER FROM THE SHOWER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE ASKED ME TO STOP FOLLOWING HIM AROUND THE SHOWER. HE SAID, COULD YOU PLEASE NOT WATCH ME SHOWER? HE SAID, PLEASE LEAVE THIS SHOWER. [ LAUGHTER ] IF I HAD A PHONE IN THE SHOWER I'D CALL THE POLICE IN THE SHOWER. [ LAUGHTER ] GET OUT -- LET THE DUDE SHOWER, MAN. THERE SHOULDN'T BE TWO OF US IN THE SHOWER.

WHAT'S HAPPENING?
Jimmy: GOOD TO SEE YOU. I LOVE THE ROOTS, BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS LOOK LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ALL LOOK LIKE?

[ LAUGHTER ] YOU WANT THE BLACK THOUGHT, YOU WANT THE FLAME? YOU WANT THE I NEVER WASH? WHAT YOU WANT?
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO BE HERE. I'M JUST MAD AT YOU, THOUGH.
Jimmy: I KNOW.
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP CHEATING ME WHEN I DO YOUR SHOWS. I GOT CHEATED WHEN I DID YOUR OTHER SHOW. THE, THE LIP SYNC SHOW.
Jimmy: YOU WERE NOT CHEATED.
I DID LIP SYNC BETTER, I WAS CHEATED.
Jimmy: I KNOW, YOU LOST.
I DIDN'T LOSE. LOSING IS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY LOSE. CHEATING IS WHEN SOMETHING WAS TAKEN FROM YOU.
Jimmy: YOU WERE GREAT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: BUT SHE JUST, SHE WAS --
THE FIX WAS IN. HERE'S THE THING. SHE CHEATED, BECAUSE SHE DID A A LL COOL J SONG. YOU CAN'T GO ON "LIP SYNC BATTLE" AND DO THE HOST'S SONG. THAT'S LIKE ME COMING HERE AND DOING A ROOTS SONG. IF I LOSE HE'S GOING TO PULL OUT HIS AFRO PICK AND STAB ME.
Jimmy: HE WILL NOT DO THAT.
BUT IF I DID, BLACK THOUGHT MIGHT BITE ME ON THE KNEECAP. I WOULD COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND IT. HE MAY CHOKE ME OUT WITH HIS DREADS. OKAY, SO THE FIX WAS IN. SHE DID A LL COOL J SONG. YOU CAN'T LOSE. HE'S THE HOST OF "LIP SYNC BATTLE." IF YOU DO A LL COOL J SONG, THAT'S CHEATING. YOU DID ROCK THE BELLS. EVERYBODY, COME ON, I KNOW LL COOL J SONGS. IF I'D KNOWN THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE CASE, I COULD HAVE COME IN AND BEEN LIKE -- ♪ MAMA SAID KNOCK YOU OUT. I'M GOING TO KNOCK YOU OUT. ♪ [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: WAIT YOU JUST -- [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ I SAID A DOMIDUBALA A DOMINOMINA [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT THE WORDS.
IF YOU LISTEN, THE MAN SAYS "A DOMINOMA." LL COOL J DON'T ALWAYS MAKE SENSE. I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL IS PINK COOKIE IN A PLASTIC BAG BEING CRUSHED BY A BUILDING. HOW TIGHT WAS HIS HAT WHEN HE WROTE THAT SONG? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T STOP MARLON WAYANS. ONCE HE COMES ON THE SHOW, YOU TAKE OVER.
I'M JUST SAYING I WAS CHEATED.
Jimmy: YOU ARE ONE OF THE FUNNIEST GUYS I EVER MET. I GOTTA SAY, YOU'RE DOING THIS PROJECT. IT'S REAL.
YES.
Jimmy: IT'S A REAL MOVIE.
YES.
Jimmy: COMING UP.
YES.
Jimmy: HERE IT IS, HERE'S THE POSTER FOR IT. "50 SHADES OF BLACK." [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T THINK OF THIS BEFORE. NOW, THIS IS REAL.
YEAH.
Jimmy: EXPLAIN WHAT THIS IS.
THAT'S MY NEXT MOVIE. IT'S CALLED "50 SHADES OF BLACK." IT'S BASICALLY CHRISTIAN GREY IF HE WAS BLACK, HE STILL GOT MONEY BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE HE GOT HIS MONEY FROM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE SHADY. HE'S LIKE INTO, LIKE, CONSTRUCTION.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. OKAY.
AND HE'S REALLY BAD IN BED. [ LAUGHTER ]

THAT WILL BE OUT NEXT JANUARY, I THINK THE 29th IT'S GOING TO BE COMING OUT.
Jimmy: AND LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS SHOW "I CAN DO THAT."
"I CAN DO THAT," GREAT SHOW.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS. IT'S A BIG HIT FOR US ON NBC. SO THANK YOU. IT'S A GOOD LEAD IN FOR US.
I WAS JUST HAPPY TO BE ON NBC, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? I WAS ON GHETTO NETWORKS, I WAS ON WB AND CW. LIKE, I COULDN'T EVEN AFFORD A A THIRD ACRONYM. [ LAUGHTER ] A THIRD NAME, LETTER IN THE ACRONYM. I'M JUST HAPPY, MAN.
Jimmy: YOU'RE HAPPY TO BE ON A THREE-LETTER NETWORK.
YEAH.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS.
I KNOW THAT THE NETWORK AIN'T GOING TO BE CANCELLED. YOU KNOW IF THEY CALL WHEN YOU ON -- NEVER MIND THE SHOW. I'M LIKE IS THE NETWORK GONNA BE ON TV TOMORROW? MY MAMA CALLED ME, THE SHOW BABY, THE NETWORK GOING TO BE ON TV TOMORROW?
Jimmy: THIS SHOW IS A GOOD IDEA. I LOVE THE PREMISE OF IT. YOU'RE THE HOST AND YOU HAVE DIFFERENT CELEBRITIES. THEY SEE DIFFERENT ACTS, ALMOST LIKE "DANCING WITH THE STARS" BUT MORE THAN DANCING.
YEAH. IT'S LIKE SIX CELEBRITIES. YOU GOT CIARA, NICOLE SCHERZINGER, CHERYL BURKE, AND THREE DUDES. AND THEN --
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
JOE JONAS, ALAN RITCHSON, JEFF DYE. AND BASICALLY THEY SEE AN ACT PERFORMED AND IF THEY THINK THEY CAN DO IT, THEY SEE LIKE THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS, OR THE BLUE MAN GROUP, OR SOME GREAT PHENOMENAL ACT, THEY THINK THEY CAN DO IT, THEY RUN TO THE TOP OF THE STAGE, THEY LOCK IN AND CHOOSE A PARTNER AND HAVE ONE WEEK TO PERFORM THAT ACT. AND SOME OF THESE ACTS ARE LIKE AERIAL ACTS, OR YOU KNOW, SOME DANGEROUS STUFF. I'M LIKE I'M GLAD I'M THE HOST. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND NOT HAVING TO TRY ANY THIS STUFF.
'CAUSE THE NAME OF THE SHOW WOULD BE "I CAN'T DO THAT." IT'D BE LIKE, AW HELL, NO. WHAT YOU GOING TO DO?
Jimmy: NO, NO, I'M SORRY. I WAS GOING TO GO TO COMMERCIAL.
I THOUGHT YOU KICK -- IT LOOKED LIKE YOU KICKING ME OFF THE SHOW? THAT'S LIKE BOB BARKER LIKE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I'M SORRY. I WAS GOING TO GO OUT ON THAT 'CAUSE IT GOT A LAUGH.
OK, I GOT YOU.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS THE PUNCH LINE AGAIN?
THERE IS NONE.
Jimmy: I CAN'T DO THAT?
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE GOING TO GET DIMINISHING RESULTS.
Jimmy: NO, NO, EVERYONE GIVE A BIG LAUGH WHEN HE SAYS "OH, HELL NO," OKAY?
ALL RIGHT, SO THEY ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE SHOW, BUT IF THAT WAS ME, IT WOULD THE "OH, HELL, NAH." ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
