Jimmy: HARRISON FORD WAS HERE, YEAH. VERY COOL TO COME OUT HERE. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HIM, AND THE MOVIE, DIRECTED BY J.J. ABRAMS.
HE'S SURLY, THOUGH. HE'S LIKE IN A SURLY MOOD.
Jimmy: HE'S SURLY?
WELL, HE RIPPED THE PANTS RIGHT OFF OF -- YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I WALKED UP TO HIM BACKSTAGE. I SAID, "YOU'RE A BRILLIANT ACTOR." HE PUNCHED ME IN THE [ BLEEP ]. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, AFTER THAT, WHAT'S HE SUPPOSED TO DO? ABSOLUTELY. YEAH.
AND I WAS OKAY WITH IT.
Jimmy: YOU WERE FINE. YOU WERE COOL WITH HAN SOLO DOING THAT.
I'LL TAKE IT.
Jimmy: YOU WOULD TAKE THAT.
AS LONG AS YOU'RE GIVING ME ATTENTION. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, YEAH. I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. WE WON'T -- WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT "STAR WARS." YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

ANYTHING FOR YOU.

YES.
Jimmy: LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS YOU AND HER, CHRISTMAS. I JUST REALIZED MY MOTHER COULD ONLY DO ONE HAIRCUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
RIGHT, MY MOTHER WAS CLEARLY A BIG FAN OF NICOLAS FROM "EIGHT IS ENOUGH." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU GUYS BOTH HAVE THE DOROTHY HAMILL. YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DO YOU REMEMBER -- SHE WOULD JUST CUT YOUR HAIR IN THE BOWL CUT?
YEAH. YOU KNOW, IF THERE WAS SOME SORT OF BIG FINANCIAL WINDFALL, WE WOULD GET A PROFESSIONAL HAIRCUT. BUT GENERALLY IT WAS --
Jimmy: IN THE MEANTIME --
YEAH, GENERALLY IT WAS HOME DONE.
Jimmy: HOME CUT, YEAH. OKAY. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU WERE OPENING? LOOK AT HOW HAPPY AND SURPRISED YOU LOOKED.
I DO. IT WAS CHRISTMAS MORNING, I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT YEAR. THAT WAS SOUND WAVE, THE TRANSFORMER. AND --
Jimmy: WHAT WAS SOUND WAVE?
SOUND WAVE WAS -- IT WAS A A ROBOT THAT TRANSFORMED INTO A A CASSETTE PLAYER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, NO, I REMEMBER THIS.
THERE WAS LIKE TWO CASSETTES THAT WOULD COME OUT OF HIS CHEST. RAVAGE AND LASER BEAK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND RAVAGE WAS LIKE A BLACK PANTHER AND LASER BEAK WAS LIKE A BIRD OF SOME KIND.
Jimmy: WOW. SO YOU WOULD LOVE THAT BECAUSE IT'S ALSO --
YEAH. AND IT WAS VERY HARD TO FIND. IT WAS LIKE, NEVER IN THE STORES. THAT I DO REMEMBER.
Jimmy: SO YOU FREAKED OUT. THAT'S A GENUINE REACTION.
YEAH. YOU COULD GET OPTIMUS PRIME. YOU COULD GET BUMBLEBEE, YOU COULDN'T GET THIS GUY.
Jimmy: COULDN'T GET THAT. NO, NO. THAT WAS THE BIG THING. WERE YOU ALWAYS INTO MUSIC? IS THAT WHY YOU LIKED THE CASSETTE TRANSFORMER? YOU ALWAYS HAD MUSIC?
THAT WAS A FLAWLESS SEGUE WAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU. I'M EMMY-NOMINATED. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, YEAH.
EMMY-NOMINATED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: EMMY-NOMINATED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CAME CLOSE. CAME CLOSE ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO. BUT NO, SERIOUSLY, I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS. I LISTEN TO SIRIUS RADIO A LOT, I LISTEN TO SIRIUSLY SINATRA -- VERY HARD TO SAY AFTER A COUPLE SHOTS. BUT YOU HAVE A HOLIDAY ALBUM.

Jimmy: AND YOU HAVE A A CIGARETTE. DO YOU EVEN SMOKE?
I WOULD MAYBE A FEW TIMES A A YEAR.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT JUST FITS THE -- IT JUST FIT THE --

Jimmy: YOU'RE FANTASTIC, THOUGH. YOU REALLY CAN SING. FANTASTIC. YOU HAVE GREAT -- IS IT JOEL McNEALY?
YEAH, JOEL McNEALY. BRILLIANT ARRANGER, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW -- TO ME, WHAT SEPARATED THE SINATR RECORDINGS FROM AL WAS, YOU KNOW, THE GREATEST VOCALIST WHO EVER LIVED. BUT ALSO, THE ONLY GUY WHO REALLY UNDERSTOOD, YOU KNOW, IF I HAVE A GREAT ORCHESTRATION, IT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE ME SOUND THAT MUCH BETTER. SO, YOU KNOW. THIS GUY IS A PHENOMENALLY TALENTED ORCHESTRATOR WHO JUST PAINTS WITH ALL OF THE COLORS OF THE BAND.

YEAH. THERE'S A FEW OF THEM. YEAH. THEY'RE ALL -- WE TRY TO PICK SONGS THAT ARE, YOU KNOW, A A LITTLE OBSCURE BECAUSE IF YOU SING "COME FLY WITH ME" YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT BETTER THAN SINATRA.
Jimmy: YEAH.
