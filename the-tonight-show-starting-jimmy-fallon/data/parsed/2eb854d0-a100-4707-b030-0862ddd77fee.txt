EVERYONE'S PICKING KENTUCKY, IS THAT IT? BLUE ACE. YEAH. BLUE ACE. I NEVER HEARD OF -- I'M SORRY THERE'S TOO MANY -- THERE'S TOO MANY -- THERE'S TOO MANY COLLEGES. SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I FILL IT OUT, I JUST HAND IT IN. EVERYONE'S FILLING OUT THEIR BRACKETS. JEB BUSH FILLED ONE OUT. YOU CAN TELL HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE HIS PICKS FOR THE FINAL FOUR ARE IOWA, IOWA, IOWA, AND IOWA. AND COME ON, THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: CLEARLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I SAW PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE DID THE BRACKET TOO. HE SAT DOWN WITH ESPN. AND HE SAID THAT HE THINKS THE NCAA SHOULD REDUCE THE SHOT CLOCK FOR BASKETBALL GAMES. YEAH. THEN HE SAID, AND WHILE THEY'RE AT IT, ANY WAY THEY CAN REDUCE THE BEING PRESIDENT CLOCK? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TAKE IT DOWN A YEAR AND A HALF? I'M READY TO GO! AND GET THIS. ACCORDING TO A PROFESSOR AT DePAUL UNIVERSITY, IF A PERSON RANDOMLY FILLS OUT THEIR MARCH MADNESS BRACKET, THEY HAVE A A 1 IN 9.2 QUINTILLION CHANCE OF GETTING IT PERFECT. OR AS GAMBLERS PUT IT, "SO YOU'RE SAYING I GOT A CHANCE? ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'LL PUT DOUBLE DOWN IF THAT'S MY CHANCES. QUINTILLION?" I MEAN, IT'S NOT A SEPTRILLION? I DIDN'T KNOW QUINTILLION WAS A A WORD, YEAH. LISTEN TO THIS. IN AN INTERVIEW IN "PLAYBOY" MAGAZINE, DICK CHENEY -- [ LAUGHTER ] DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT?
Steve: DICK CHENEY?
Jimmy: IN AN INTERVIEW WITH "PLAYBOY" MAGAZINE, DICK CHENEY CRITICIZED PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SAID HE'S "THE WORST PRESIDENT OF HIS LIFETIME WITHOUT QUESTION." [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] THEN CHENEY WAS LIKE, "BUT ENOUGH TALK, WHEN DO I TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF?" [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE LIKE, "NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT." THAT'S RIGHT DICK CHENEY DID AN INTERVIEW IN "PLAYBOY'S" LATEST ISSUE, AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THEY ACTUALLY GAVE HIM THE COVER. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS COVER. [ LAUGHTER ] CHECK OUT SOME OF THE STORIES IN -- "COMPATIBILITY QUIZ: IS THIS BABOON HEART RIGHT FOR YOU?" [ APPLAUSE ] THEN WE HAVE "WHEN IT'S OKAY TO SHOOT SOMEONE IN THE FACE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, "SHOCK AND AWE: THE FIRST TIME SHE SEES YOU NAKED." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, THESE ARE BIG STORIES THAT YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT IN "PLAYBOY." "PLAYBOY" MAGAZINE'S ON STANDS TODAY. THIS IS GREAT HERE. OUR PAL, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE LOVE THAT GUY. I MEAN, WE REALLY DO. HE WAS GIVING A SPEECH YESTERDAY ABOUT HIS STATE'S BUDGET TROUBLE. AND HE PLACED A LOT OF THE BLAME ON THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN CHARGE BEFORE HE ENTERED OFFICE. BUT LISTEN TO THE WAY HE PUT IT. WATCH THIS.
I'M LIKE THE GUY WHO SHOWED UP FOR DINNER AT DESSERT, AND THEN EVERYBODY WENT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND NEVER CAME BACK, AND I GOT THE CHECK. THAT'S FINE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: CAN WE GO BACK? LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE REACTION OF THE LADY BEHIND HIM HAS WHEN HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT FOOD. WATCH.
I'M LIKE THE GUY WHO SHOWED UP FOR DINNER AT DESSERT AND THEN EVERYBODY WENT -- [ DING ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU DID NOT JUST TALK ABOUT -- THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOU ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW." MUST BE AN EMOJI FOR "OH, NO HE DIDN'T." [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S A BIG INTERNATIONAL STORY HERE. ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WON RE-ELECTION YESTERDAY AFTER A A REALLY TIGHT RACE. YOU KNOW HE HAD ACTUALLY A LOT OF SUPPORT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING ACTOR CHUCK NORRIS. WHICH EXPLAINS CHUCK'S NEW PROJECT, "WALKER: TEXAS RABBI." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'LL WATCH IT. TEXAS RABBI? OF COURSE, YESTERDAY WAS ST. PATRICK'S DAY. YOU GUYS RECOVERING? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PEOPLE WERE OUT PARTYING ALL OVER THE STREETS OF NEW YORK. WELL, WE WANTED TO HAVE A A LITTLE FUN WITH THEM. SO WE SENT OUR WRITER ARTHUR OUT THERE TO ASK PEOPLE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE HISTORY OF ST. PATRICK'S DAY. WHAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT HE NEVER ACTUALLY GETS TO THE QUESTION. AND YOU'LL SEE JUST HOW PATIENT AND COOL PEOPLE ARE, EVEN WHEN THEY'RE DRUNK ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY IN NEW YORK CITY. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IN A A NEW SEGMENT WE CALL "THE BIG QUESTION." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ THE BIG QUESTION ♪
OF COURSE, YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT ST. PATRICK'S DAY, OR THE FEAST OF ST. PATRICK IF WE'RE BEING TECHNICAL, IS A CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY HELD ON MARCH 17th. WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE TRADITIONAL DEATH DATE OF ST. PATRICK, WHO AS EVERYBODY WAS THE FOREMOST PATRON SAINT OF IRELAND. AND THAT ST. PATRICK'S DAY WAS MADE AN OFFICIAL CHRISTIAN FEAST DAY IN THE EARLY 17th CENTURY THAT IS OBSERVED BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION, ESPECIALLY THE CHURCH OF IRELAND. THE EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCH AND LUTHERAN CHURCH.
CAN WE GET TO THE QUESTION, PLEASE?
AND THAT THE DAY COMMEMORATES ST. PATRICK. AND IT'S THESE SORTS OF TRADITIONS AND CUSTOMS THAT MANY WOULD SAY BRING NOT JUST IRISH PEOPLE BUT PEOPLE OF ALL ETHNICITIES, GENDERS, RACES, AND RELIGIOUS BACKGROUNDS TOGETHER.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
SO THESE ANNUAL PRACTICES -- HUNDREDS UPON --
THOUSANDS.
-- HUNDREDS. THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS. EVEN MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF YOUNG ADULTS. OLDER ADULTS, OLD PEOPLE. TEENAGERS, CHILDREN, TODDLERS, BABIES. SMALLER BABIES, AND EVEN SMALLER BABIES. SO IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT OF THESE TRADITIONS OF THESE OBSERVANCES, TO UPHOLD THESE TRADITIONS YEAR AFTER YEAR. SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS IF YOU REMEMBER THE SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE HOLIDAY. IF WE REMEMBER THE COLOR GREEN'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE FLAG USED BY THE IRISH CATHOLIC CONFEDERATION. IF YOU REMEMBER THE COLOR'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE IRISH NATIONALISM. THE PHRASE "WEARING OF THE GREEN" COMES TO MIND. THEN I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION IS, LOOKING AT IT LOGICALLY AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT MUCH OF WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT ST. PATRICK COMES FROM THE DECLARATION. WHICH, OF COURSE WAS WRITTEN BY PATRICK HIMSELF, AS YOU KNOW.
YEAH. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED.
TO CONVERT THE PAGAN IRISH TO CHRISTIANITY, WHICH YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY IS WHAT I'M SAYING. SO I GUESS ALL THAT SAID, I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS HOW'S IT GOING?
WELL, IT'S GOING WELL.
AWESOME, GREAT. THANKS. BACK TO YOU, JIMMY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: GREAT JOB, ARTHUR. OH, MY GOODNESS. NEW YORK CITY. THAT'S FANTASTIC. OH, MAN. YOU GUYS, THIS IS COOL. YESTERDAY, NINTENDO ANNOUNCED THAT IT FINALLY HAS PLANS TO DEVELOP GAMES FOR SMARTPHONES, WHICH CAUSED THEIR STOCK TO GO UP 24% IN ONE DAY. OR AS NINTENDO PUT IT -- [ MARIO GROWING SOUND ] [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, I SAW THAT THE FIRST GOVERNMENT-RUN MARIJUANA STORE OPENED UP IN WASHINGTON STATE THIS WEEK. AND I THINK THE EMPLOYEES ARE STILL GETTING USED TO THEIR JOBS SELLING WEED. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS VIDEO.
