Jimmy: SANTA BARBARA.
EITHER THE OCEAN OR THE MOUNTAINS. SO IT'S -- I'VE GOTTEN, LUCKY. THAT'S FOR SURE.

BUT I CAN GIVE YOU MY E-MAIL IF YOU EVER WANT TO. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS THINKING IF WE DID GO OUT -- IF WE DID GO OUT AND HANG OUT WITH EACH OTHER, PEOPLE WILL JUST YELL, "IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME, HEY BUDDY." I MEAN, IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS OR DOES EVERYONE JUST YELLS THAT AT YOU.
WELL, I'M ALWAYS SURPRISED WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT SAY TO ME. ESPECIALLY IN NEW YORK.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO.
NO BUT IT IS. I THINK PROBABLY THAT'S THE THING I'M HAPPIEST ABOUT. WHEN SOMEONE COMES UP TO ME TO SAY PERHAPS THEIR FAVORITE MOVIE IS. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF MOUTH. AND IT COULD BE ONE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT MOVIES PEOPLE WILL SAY.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A LOT OF FILMS.
YEAH. BUT I'M GLAD THAT MY CAREER DIDN'T DRILL DOWN TO A SINGLE MOVIE. YOU KNOW, SO I ARE THEY GOING TO SAY "JFK" OR ARE THEY GONNA SAY "OPEN RANGE" OR ARE THEY GOING TO SAY SOMETHING.
Jimmy: "WHOSE THE SECOND SHOOTER? SUP BUDDY?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "YEAH I HEARD YOU BUDDY. SECOND SHOOTER. YEAH, EXACTLY." "IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME." "HEARD YOU DO FIRST TIME PAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YEAH."
YOU KNOW HOW -- YOU KNOW HOW I GOT THAT PART, THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE, REALLY A FABULOUS ACTOR, A VERY FUNNY PERSON. IN THE END, THE DIRECTOR SAID, "NO -- I THINK PEOPLE WILL THINK HE DOES HEAR THINGS." AND SO I GOT THE PART BECAUSE THE GUY WAS REALLY CONVINCED THAT I WOULD BE IN THE CORN FIELD. AND I WOULD BE A PERSON THAT WOULD REALLY BE TROUBLED BY HEARING VOICES AND THE OTHER ACTOR WAS NO WE THINK HE HEARS [ BLEEP ] ANYWAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S TOO OUT THERE, YEAH, YEAH. I GOTTA SAY, I TOLD YOU BACKSTAGE, "HATFIELD'S AND THE McCOY'S" WAS FANTASTIC. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE YOU FOR TRYING TO DO THAT. I'D NEVER SEEN YOU ON TV BEFORE, RIGHT? HAVE I?
YEAH. THAT'S OUR MOST FAMOUS FEUD. IT WAS JUST -- IT WAS JUST REALLY GREAT TO MAKE THAT. IT WAS UNIQUE TO THAT YOU GUYS -- A LOT OF TIMES, PEOPLE AREN'T CONVINCED THAT YOU'RE GONNA SIT STILL FOR STUFF. ESPECIALLY MY STUFF, LIKE THREE HOURS LONG.
Jimmy: LIKE PEOPLE IN BUSINESS?
WELL I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM AND THE IDEA IS WHAT IF EVERYONE IS WRONG. THAT'S THE ONE I TRY TO SUBSCRIBE TO. AND ORIGINALLY "HATFIELD'S" WAS ONLY GOING TO BE TWO NIGHTS LONG. BUT THE MATERIAL WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. AND IT WAS -- I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS A MINUTE OF IT. AND THE HISTORY CHANNEL AGREED.

YEAH I AM, I'M TAKING OFF TOMORROW TONIGHT. I'M GOING TO GO TO UP TO SENECA AND PLAY -- AND THEN -- I'LL BE OUT 14 DAYS AND WE'LL PLAY -- I'M GONNA PLAY LONG ISLAND AT THE PARAMOUNT.
Jimmy: OH, IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ] SO I'VE HAD THIS BAND FOR ABOUT NINE YEARS. I ONLY WANTED TO PLAY WHEREVER I WAS MAKING A MOVIE. I FELT LIKE I WAS IN THESE COMMUNITIES FOR TWO AND THREE MONTHS AND REALLY NEVER MEETING ANYBODY OTHER THAN A QUICK SNAPSHOT OR SOMETHING IN THE MARKET. I JUST THOUGHT IF I COULD PLAY LIVE WHEREVER I WAS AT MAKING A A MOVIE. AND NINE YEARS LATER WE PLAYED ALL OVER THE WORLD.

Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, SURE. ABSOLUTELY.
OKAY.
Jimmy: I MEAN THAT WAS SOME PART OF IT. ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
SHE'S ADORABLE. SHE'S ADORABLE. I'VE SEEN PICTURES ONLINE. SHE'S THE CUTEST LITTLE THING.
Jimmy: AW, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I APPRECIATE THAT.
CONGRATULATIONS.
Jimmy: DO YOU HEAR THAT KEVIN? [ LAUGHTER ] NOW YOU HAVE A CHILD, RIGHT?
I DO YEAH. HE'S THREE YEARS OLD.
Jimmy: THREE YEARS OLD. NOW HE'S NOT SEEN "THE WONDER YEARS" HAS HE?
NO.
Jimmy: TOO YOUNG FOR THAT.
YEAH, YEAH. HE ONLY WATCHES GARBAGE TRUCK VIDEOS.
Jimmy: GARBAGE TRUCK VIDEOS?
YEAH. REAL ONES, NOT LIKE CARTOONS BUT ACTUAL YOUTUBE VIDEOS OF GARBAGE TRUCKS PICKING UP THE GARBAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] HIS FAVORITE THING, I'M NOT KIDDING. HE LOVES IT.
Jimmy: IS EVERYTHING OKAY? EVERYTHING ALRIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH IT'S GREAT.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT HE LIKES?
NO, NO, FOR A SPECIAL TREAT ON GARBAGE DAY, I DRIVE IN THE CAR WITH HIM AND WE TRAIL THE GARBAGE TRUCK. [ LAUGHTER ] FREE ENTERTAINMENT. AND THE DRIVER'S LIKE, HE'S LIKE, "YOU CAN PASS US." I'M LIKE, "NO, NO, NO. IT'S FINE. WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PASS YOU."
Jimmy: STUPID GIRL IS STALKING ME BACK THERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE JUST LIKES WATCHES THEM PICK UP THE GARBAGE AND THROW IT IN THE BIG TRUCK?
YEAH. HE LOVES IT.
Jimmy: WELL BOYS, THEY LOVE TRUCKS RIGHT?
WHATEVER THEY LOVE. YOU KNOW YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO BE HAPPY SO --
Jimmy: I HAVE A TRUCK. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'LL TAKE SOME VIDEOS AND SEND IT OUT TO YOU. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. NOW -- SO YOU FINISHED "WONDER YEARS," YOU WENT TO COLLEGE.
YES.
Jimmy: AND YOU BECAME A A GENIUS? NO.
I MAJORED IN MATH.
Jimmy: YOU MAJORED IN MATH.
YES.
Jimmy: WHY? [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S SO MANY MUCH EASIER THINGS.
CAUSE MATH DOESN'T SUCK.
Jimmy: I KNOW MATH DOESN'T SUCK. NO, NO, NO. THIS IS, WHAT IS THIS, "NEW YORK TIMES" BEST SELLER. "MATH DOESN'T SUCK" AND -- [ APPLAUSE ] YOUR POINT OF THIS IS --
I LOVE MATH BECAUSE IT'S CHALLENGING. IT CHALLENGES MY BRAIN. IT MAKES --IT MAKES YOU THINK, IT MAKES YOU A BETTER PROBLEM SOLVER IN LIFE, YOU KNOW. IT TEACHES GIRLS --THESE BOOKS TEACH GIRLS HOW TO DO MATH BUT ALSO TO BE TO WANT TO BE SMART. TO KNOW THAT, THAT EMPOWERS YOU IN ALL AREAS OF LIFE.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW YOU, YOU HAVE ONE THING IN THE BOOK THAT'S NOT EVEN -- IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO DO WITH MATH BUT IS A PROBLEM. IT'S PALINDROMES?
OH YEAH, THAT'S NOT THE BOOKS. WELL ACTUALLY I THINK IT IS IN MY FOURTH BOOK. I LOVE PALINDROMES BECAUSE THEY'RE FUN. FIRST OF ALL, A PALINDROME IS A A WORD OR A PHRASE SPELLED THE SAME FORWARD AND BACKWARDS. AND THEY'RE BRAIN TEASERS.
Jimmy: SO LIKE WHAT? LIKE KAYAK.
KAYAK IS A PALINDROME.
Jimmy: RIGHT?
EXACTLY.
K-A-Y-A-K.
THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH. RACECAR. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK TO THE FIFTH HOUR OF THE "TODAY SHOW." I'M TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO SPELL APPARENTLY. WHAT AM I DOING? SORRY. KAYAK.
BUT ON MY TWITTER, EVERY THURSDAY ON MY TWITTER ACCOUNT, I PUT OUT A CHALLENGE, A CLUE, AND THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS A A PALINDROME.
Jimmy: OH.
YEAH. SO, DO YOU WANT TO PLAY?
Jimmy: I WOULD LIKE TRY. I WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO DO IT.
I JUST SO HAPPEN TO HAVE SOME WITH ME HERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DID NOT SEE THIS. I DID NOT SEE ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS. KEVIN DO YOU WANT TO PLAY?
Kevin: NO, NO, NO. MY PITS STARTED TO SWEAT AS SOON AS I SAW THAT BOOK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NEVER GOOD. THAT HIS ARM PITS STARTING SWEATING. OH HERE WE GO, ALRIGHT. PALINDROME, HERE WE GO.
ALRIGHT SO.
Jimmy: KEVIN IT WILL BE FUN. WE WON'T GET YOU INVOLVED.
Kevin: ALRIGHT.
Jimmy: IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE MAKE OUR GUESTS SIT AT THE OPPOSITE END.
THIS ISN'T THE MATH.
Jimmy: ALRIGHT NOT EVEN MATH, HERE WE GO.
THIS IS A NICKNAME FOR A A PHYSICIAN WHO'S UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING TO PATIENTS.
Jimmy: A PHYSICIAN --
YEAH.
Jimmy:  --WHOSE UNCOMFORTABLE --
YEAH.
Jimmy: TALKING TO -- SO CAN IT BE TWO WORDS?
YES. THIS IS GOING TO BE -- SHOULD I JUST TELL YOU? DOCTOR AWKWARD. DOCTOR AWKWARD IS A PALINDROME.
Jimmy: OH BOY. I WOULD'VE NEVER GOTTEN THAT.
OKAY, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
Jimmy: WHAT? AND YOU THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW HAVE YOU? NO IDEA. THAT IS WAY BEYOND -- THAT IS LIKE THE SIXTH BOOK IN THE DANICA McKELLAR SERIES. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S GO A ONE-ON-ONE. GIVE ME A ONE-ON-ONE TYPE OF THING.
KAYAK.
Jimmy: I'M GIVING YOU HINT. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S MARTIANS --
Jimmy: WE FLOAT ON A BOAT AND USE IT A PADDLE WITH IT.
IF MARTIANS LANDED AND WE FOUND THEIR --
Jimmy: IF THEY LANDED. DUH, THEY ALREADY HAVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
IF WE FOUND THEIR USED TISSUES BOARD, WE DISCOVERED LOTS OF QUOTE, LOTS OF ALIEN BOOGERS. LOTS OF ALIEN BOOGERS. REWORD THAT.
Jimmy: SNOT ROCKETS?
CLOSE.
Jimmy: SNOT --
TONS OF UFO SNOT. THAT'S A PALINDROME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I GOT TO GET THIS BOOK. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME THE ANSWERS AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE QUESTIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'D BE LIKE JEOPARDY. IT'S BE LIKE JEOPARDY. YEAH, YEAH. I'LL DO MUCH BETTER AT THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GIVE US "TONS OF UFO SNOT" AND I'M LIKE, OH THESE ARE THINGS ARE IF MARTIANS LANDED. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE, WHAT ARE, IF MARTIANS LANDED, WHAT WOULD THEIR BOOGERS BE LIKE?
NO IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE TO THINK AND EXERCISING THAT PART OF THE BRAIN.
Jimmy: I'LL FOLLOW YOU ON TWITTER AND I WILL ANSWER YOU BACK ON TWITTER. AND I'LL HOPEFULLY HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER. BUT MORE EXCITING, "DANCING WITH THE STARS."
YEAH.
Jimmy: HOW DO WE VOTE FOR YA? HOW DO WE DO THIS? WHAT DO WE DO?

I'M LOVING IT. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE TOO SCARED TO DO IT. TOM BERGERON CONVINCED ME TO DO IT. I WAS LIKE, "OH MY GOSH I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE DANCING IN FRONT OF LIKE 20 MILLION PEOPLE." BUT IT IS AWESOME. IT'S NERVE WRACKING, BUT JUST LIKE THE MATH STUFF, IT'S A A CHALLENGE, YOU KNOW. IT'S LIKE OKAY WHAT ARE YOU MADE OF? LIKE LET'S GO UP THERE AND FACE YOUR FEARS.
