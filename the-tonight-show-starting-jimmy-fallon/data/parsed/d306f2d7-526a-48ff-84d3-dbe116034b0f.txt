Jimmy: THANK YOU. WELCOME. OH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOT CROWD! HOT CROWD TONIGHT! WELCOME, EVERYBODY. YOU LOOK GREAT. LOOKING GOOD. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THIS WHAT IS PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THE BIG NEWS IS THAT HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN PAUL RYAN JUST RELEASED HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR 2015. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CRITICIZING IT. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING A SPEECH YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA REFERRED TO THE BUDGET AS "A STINK BURGER" AND A "MEANWICH." [ LAUGHTER ] STINKBURGER AND A MEAN -- THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAID THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] RYAN CALLED OBAMA IMMATURE, WHILE CHRIS CHRISTIE CALLED TO SEE IF THEY HAD ANY MORE OF THOSE STINKBURGERS OR MEANWICHES. [ LAUGHTER ] I HEARD THEY'VE BEEN OUT OF BUSINESS FOR LIKE TEN YEARS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GOING TO FINISH THAT STINKBURGER? RYAN SAYS HIS PLAN WOULD BALANCE FEDERAL SPENDING IN TEN YEARS. IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY DETAILED PLAN THAT HE LAYS OUT MONTH BY MONTH. HERE, TAKE A LOOK. IN JANUARY 2015, HE WANTS TO HAVE OBAMACARE REPEALED. IN FEBRUARY, HE WANTS TO BEGIN ENACTING $5 TRILLION IN CUTS. IN MARCH, HE WANTS TO INCREASE DEFENSE SPENDING -- [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S LIKE, "CAN I SEE APRIL?" LET'S SEE MAY. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. HE'S TRYING TO SELL US HIS 2 2015 CALENDAR -- BUDGET HUNKS 2015. [ APPLAUSE ] I'M PRETTY SURE I'M NOT GOING TO BUY THAT CALENDAR.
I GOT LAST YEAR'S CALENDAR. AND IT WAS WORTH IT.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN WE TURN HIS MICROPHONE OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] OUR GOOD PAL ROB FORD IS AT IT AGAIN. HE'S THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO OUR MONOLOGUE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO COMEDY IN TEN YEARS. GET THIS. SO YESTERDAY HE WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF TORONTO'S CITY COUNCIL TO VOTE NO ON A MEASURE TO CONGRATULATE CANADA'S WINTER OLYMPIANS. [ LAUGHTER ] HE SAID, "LOOK, IF SOMEONE'S GOING TO BE REWARDED FOR NOT FALLING ON THEIR FACE, IT SHOULD BE ME." OKAY? GOT TO GET SOMETHING. [ APPLAUSE ] GOT TO GET SOMETHING. FORD ALSO VOTED AGAINST NAMING A STREET AFTER NELSON MANDELA. BUT HE CLAIMS THAT HE SIMPLY HIT THE WRONG BUTTON. THEN PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR ROB FORD WERE LIKE, "BEEN THERE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHO DOESN'T WANT TO CELEBRATE THE OLYMPICS? WHAT IS HE DOING? THIS IS KIND OF SAD NEWS HERE, YOU GUYS. THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT JUST CONFIRMED THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS FINALIZED HIS DIVORCE FROM HIS WIFE OF 30 YEARS.

Jimmy: YEAH, AND NEW YORKERS, THEY LOVE YOU HERE RIGHT?
WELL, I GUESS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'VE ALWAYS -- I'VE ALWAYS HAD AN AMAZING TIME WORKING HERE. I THINK NEW YORK GIVES ITSELF A A VERY HARD TIME FOR BEING KIND OF HARD-NOSED AND YOU KNOW TOUGH.

Jimmy: I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU.
IT'S A LOVELY THING.

I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING PEOPLE IT'S KIND OF COOLER IN NEW YORK TO NOT NOTICE SOMEBODY. I DON'T KNOW --
Jimmy: YEAH.
I HAVE A VERY EASY TIME THERE. AND PEOPLE DO COME UP WE'RE REALLY COOL AND POLITE AND SWEET.
Jimmy: DO YOU GET STAR STRUCK OR YOU PROBABLY MET EVERYBODY?
NO I GET REALLY STAR STRUCK. SO IF I -- I DON'T FREEZE UP AS MUCH AS I KIND OF ATTACK PEOPLE WITH COMPLIMENTS. I JUST TELL THEM, "I JUST THINK YOU'RE AMAZING AND THIS IS WHY."
Jimmy: YOU AND YOUR VOICE COULD SPEAK FOR TWO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OH MY GOD. YOU ARE SO AMAZING. I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU. DEEP INTO MY SOUL TO TELLING ME HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.
THE MOST -- THE WORST IT'S EVER BEEN IS WAS I MET TOM BRADY ONCE AT A BIG SORT OF -- I'M A BIG AMERICAN FOOTBALL FAN. I'M A BIG FAN OF IT HIM.
Jimmy: REALLY?
I AM. YEAH, I'M AN OBSESSIVE NFL FAN. AND BUT YEAH, I WATCHED A A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT TOM BRADY CALLED "THE BRADY SIX." IT'S ONE OF THE NFL FILMS YOU SHOULD ALL WATCH IT, IT'S AWESOME. BUT IT'S -- AND I MET HIM.
Jimmy: WHAT'S IT CALLED AGAIN?
"THE BRADY SIX," IT'S ABOUT THE SIX QUARTERBACKS THAT WERE TAKEN AHEAD OF HIM.
Jimmy: I THOUGHT IT WAS BRADY SOMETHING ELSE. I WAS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
SO I MET HIM AND I WAS JUST LIKE -- HE WAS WITH GISELE WHO -- I MUST HAVE BEEN THE FIRST MAN IN EXISTENCE TO TOTALLY IGNORE. I SAID, "YOU'RE SO COOL. I THINK YOU'RE SO AWESOME. JUST CONTINUE DOING WHAT YOU DO," AND JUST LIKE LEFT. AND BARELY GAVE HIM A CHANCE TO REPLY. AS I WAS WALKING AWAY I HEARD GISELE GO "HE'S SO CUTE." I WAS LIKE, "YES!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: IS IT INISHMAAN?
INISHMAAN.
Jimmy: INISHMAAN. ALL RIGHT GOOD. WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY? INISHMAN?
INISHMAAN. I HAD THE OTHER DAY WHICH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
Jimmy: INISHMAAN. IRISH, YOU PLAY IRISH.
I DO, I PLAY A YOUNG IRISH BOY IN SORT OF THE 1930s. A VERY, VERY, VERY, FUNNY DARK COMEDY. ANYONE WHO LIKES MARTIN McDONAGH'S WORK LIKE "IN BRUGES" AND "SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS" --
Jimmy: YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ] IS IT TOUGH TO DO AN IRISH ACCENT IF YOU'RE ENGLISH?
IT'S -- MY DAD'S NORTHERN IRISH SO I GREW UP AROUND. MY DAD DIDN'T HAVE AN ACCENT FROM AROUND HIS FAMILY I GREW UP AROUND IT A BIT. AND I OBVIOUSLY TOOK LESSONS -- MOST OF THE CAST IS IRISH. SO THAT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER. BECAUSE YOU SORT OF JUST PICK UP ON IT BY OSMOSIS A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T SLIP IN A A BRITISH ACCENT AND LIKE, "TOP OF THE MORNING." [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL THAT'S THE THING. I WAS BACK STAGE AND I'VE BEEN IN REHEARSAL ALL DAY TODAY I WAS BACKSTAGE AND I WAS TALKING IN THE IRISH ACCENT JUST THINKING, "YOU HAVE TO STOP NOW BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU'LL GO OUT THERE AND PEOPLE WILL THINK YOU'RE JUST TERRIBLY AFFECTED OR SOMETHING.
Jimmy: DIFFERENT, YEAH. YOU'VE DONE THIS ALREADY IN LONDON.
WE DID IT IN LONDON FOR, I THINK FOUR MONTHS AND WE HAD AN AMAZING REACTION. I'M REALLY EXCITED --
Jimmy: DO YOU THINK NEW YORK IS GOING TO LOVE IT AND EMBRACE IT AS WELL?
I HOPE SO. THERE'S LIKE A BIG IRISH CONNECTION FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN NEW YORK WHO HAVE IRISH FAMILY. AND SO, ANYBODY WHO HAS THE IRISH FAMILY WILL I THINK SEE A A LOT OF SORT OF WHAT THEY RECOGNIZE IN THIS SHOW PARTICULARLY IN THE WAY PEOPLE ARE SORT OF, SHOW AFFECTION THROUGH KIND OF GRUFFNESS AND CRUELTY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT IS IRISH CULTURE. YEAH, I GREW UP IRISH. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, YEAH. I LOVE YOU I HATE YOU. IT'S SO GOOD.
THERE'S A LOT OF THAT. IT'S A REALLY -- YEAH I THINK YOU'LL DEFINITELY ENJOY. IF YOU HAVE AN IRISH FAMILY, THERE'S A COUPLE OF AUNTIES IN THIS THAT I DEFINITELY KNOW I HAVE A COUPLE OF IRISH AUNTS VERY LIKE THIS.
Jimmy: WHAT IS THE GIST OF THE PLAY?
BASICALLY IT'S ABOUT -- MY CHARACTER BILLY IS LIVING ON THIS VERY, VERY RURAL COMMUNITY ON THIS ISLAND. AND ON THE NEIGHBORING ISLAND IN 1934, A FILM CREW ARRIVED TO MAKE AT THE TIME, THE MOST EXPENSIVE FILM EVER MADE WHICH IS REAL THING THAT HAPPENED. BILLY SEES THIS AS HIS OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS GOD FORSAKEN ISLAND. IT'S ABOUT -- IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT HIM TRYING TO MAKE HIS WAY -- TRYING TO GET TO HOLLYWOOD ESSENTIALLY FROM INISHMAAN. AND IT'S ABOUT -- KIND OF THE WAY THE COMMUNITY IS AFFECTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF THIS FILM CREW. IT'S REALLY, REALLY FUN AND IT'S VERY MOVING AND VERY FUNNY.

I LIKE WATCHING PEOPLE BE REALLY GOOD AT STUFF. IT'S GOOD. AND THEN -- AND THEN -- THIS NEW ONE WHICH I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN YET BUT I'VE SEEN THE TRAILER CALLED "KITCHEN CASINO" WHICH SEEMS LIKE THE MOST INSANE GAME THAT'S EVER BEEN INVENTED. IT'S JUST LIKE, THERE SEEMS TO BE FOUR KITCHENS ON SOME SORT OF ROULETTE WHEEL. AND THEY JUST LIKE SPIN AND IT'S SOME SORT OF GAMBLING COME COOKERY SHOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M IN. I'M IN. TOTALLY IN, I WOULD TOTALLY WATCH THAT. HAVE YOU SEEN "KNIFE FIGHT?"
NO, WHAT'S "KNIFE FIGHT"?
Jimmy: HAS ANYONE SEE "KNIFE FIGHT?" IT'S ON ESQUIRE NETWORK. IT'S GREAT.
WHAT IS -- WHAT IS THE PREMISE? IT'S ALMOST LIKE "TOP CHEF" BUT IT'S ONLY A HALF HOUR. CAUSE YOU GET EVERYTHING IN A A HALF HOUR. TWO CHEFS, THEY COME OUT IN THIS TUNNEL -- COME IN LIKE A A CAVE, AND THEY THROW DOWN, AND THEY GIVE THEM LIKE THREE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS AND THEY JUST KIND OF GO CRAZY.

FIRST PHOTO SHOOT. I ACTUALLY ASKED MY MOM COULD I CHANGE SUITS MIDWAY, AND SHE WAS LIKE, "NO, IT'S JUST -- YOU KNOW, WE'RE AT SEARS & ROEBUCKS, HUN. YOU CAN'T."
Jimmy: I GUESS THAT'S WHERE YOU WENT.
THAT WAS GOOD.
Jimmy: EVERYBODY WENT TO SEARS TO GET THAT.
BUT IT WAS A PHOTO SHOOT IN MY MIND.
Jimmy: YOU LOOK SHARP RIGHT THERE. THIS COULD BE -- THIS IS A "GQ" MODEL RIGHT HERE. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
IT'S CUTE.
Jimmy: DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENT NOW THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO TURN 50? ANYTHING?
OH, YOU KNOW, THE MAIN THING REALLY IS JUST KIND OF I GOT TO PROTECT MYSELF FROM -- I'M LIKE A CRIME FIGHTER FOR GRAY HAIR, YOU KNOW? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE A CRIME FIGHTER FOR GRAY HAIR?
GRAY HAIR IS THE WORST. YOU CANNOT GET RID OF GRAY HAIR. NO MATTER WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, GRAY HAIR ALWAYS JUST POPS UP. YOU CAN COLOR IT. YOU CAN CUT IT. IT'S JUST GOING TO COME BACK AND -- I'M LIKE, EACH DAY I'M LIKE A CRIME FIGHTER. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STOP THE GRAY HAIR FROM HAPPENING, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO SQUASH IT.
YEAH. I HAVE TO SQUASH IT. I HAVE A CAPE AND TIGHTS AND EVERYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] I DO IT, UH --
Jimmy: YOU REALLY DO IT THE RIGHT WAY.
WELL, I'M REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU REALLY FIGHT IT.
YEAH, IT'S A LOT. I GO IN PHONE BOOTHS FOR NO REASON. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S WEIRD.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YES. I HAVE AN ENGLISH BUTLER, YOU KNOW? YES, IT'S VERY SERIOUS.
Jimmy: YOU'RE FIGHTING THAT.
YEAH, FIGHTING GRAY CONSTANTLY, MAN. YOU CAN'T RID OF THEM. I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF LIKE, YOU KNOW, OLD REGGAE SINGERS. LIKE, YOU KNOW -- "THERE'S JUST GRAY EVERYWHERE AND THEY STAND STRONG AND THEY WON'T GO THROUGH YARDY. AND THEY WON'T GO ANYWHERE." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: TWO YARD.
YARDY!
Jimmy: THEY WON'T DO IT.
THEY WON'T STAND FOR IT.
Jimmy: THEY WON'T DO IT. ROOTS, CAN WE GET A BEAT?

Jimmy: OKAY.
