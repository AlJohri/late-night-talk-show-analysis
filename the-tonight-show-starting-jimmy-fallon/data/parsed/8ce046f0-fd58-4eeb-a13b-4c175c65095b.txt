Questlove: 503 PORTLAND.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I FEEL THE LOVE! I FEEL THE LOVE! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WOW, HEY, WELCOME, EVERYBODY. PLEASE, ENJOY YOURSELVES. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THIS IS IT, YOU MADE IT, YOU'RE AT THE SHOW. YOU'RE A BIG PART OF THE SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME, EVERYBODY. BEFORE WE START, I WANT TO SAY THAT IF ANY OF THESE JOKES SOUND OLD, IT'S BECAUSE MICHELLE OBAMA USED THEM IN 2008. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO, NOT MY FAULT, OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE BIG STORY. MELANIA TRUMP GAVE A SPEECH LAST NIGHT AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION AND SHE'S BEING ACCUSED OF STEALING FROM THE SPEECH MICHELLE OBAMA GAVE AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN 2008 AND THEY DO SEEM KIND OF SIMILAR. TAKE A LISTEN.
YOU WORK HARD FOR WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE.
YOU WORK HARD FOR WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE.
THAT YOUR WORD IS YOUR BOND, AND YOU DO WHAT YOU SAY.
THAT YOUR WORD IS YOUR BOND, THAT YOU DO WHAT YOU SAY YOU'RE GONNA DO.
THAT YOU TREAT PEOPLE WITH RESPECT.
THAT YOU TREAT PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.
BECAUSE WE WANT OUR CHILDREN IN THIS NATION TO KNOW --
BECAUSE WE WANT OUR CHILDREN AND ALL CHILDREN IN THIS NATION TO KNOW -- [ TOGETHER ]
THAT THE ONLY LIMIT OF THE HEIGHT OF YOUR ACHIEVEMENT IS THE REACH OF YOUR DREAMS AND WILLINGNESS TO WORK HARD FOR THEM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WOW.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: DONALD TRUMP WAS, LIKE, MICHELLE OWES MELANIA AN APOLOGY FOR BUILDING A TIME MACHINE AND STEALING HER BEST LINES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OKAY? BUT AT LEAST DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T STEAL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
Jimmy: WHATEVER! HEY, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? LET'S HAVE A GOOD TIME HERE. GOSH. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. I GOT A LITTLE ANGRY.
Steve: YEAH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: OF COURSE TODAY CONSERVATIVES WERE RUSHING TO MELANIA'S DEFENSE. CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID IT WASN'T REALLY PLAGIARISM BECAUSE IT WAS 93% DIFFERENT THAN MICHELLE OBAMA'S. [ LAUGHTER ] SO LET THAT BE A LESSON, KIDS, CHEATING IS WRONG UNLESS YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT 7% OF THE TIME. THEN -- [ APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER, PAUL MANAFORT, SAID TODAY THAT MELANIA'S SPEECH WAS SIMILAR TO MICHELLE OBAMA'S BECAUSE THEY MUST FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THEIR FAMILY, AND MELANIA SAID, YES, ESPECIALLY MY DAUGHTERS, SASHA AND MALIA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THERE WERE ACTUALLY SOME PRETTY POWERFUL MOMENTS IN THE REST OF MELANIA'S SPEECH. FOR INSTANCE, SHE SAID THAT BEING A CITIZEN OF THE U.S. IS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE ON PLANET EARTH. SHE WAS LIKE, "IN AMERICA, YOU FLY ON PRIVATE PLANE, YOU LIVE IN GIANT GOLD TOWER AND OWN LOTS OF GOLF COURSES. IT IS A GREAT COUNTRY." [ APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, THE CONVENTION'S GOING ON ALL WEEK, AND I SAW THAT ACTUALLY HAS A DIFFERENT THEME EACH NIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT, THE THEMES ARE DENIAL, ANGER, BARGAINING, DEPRESSION, AND ACCEPTANCE. [ APPLAUSE ] AND THIS IS CRAZY, DELEGATES ON THE FLOOR OF THE CONVENTION ERUPTED WHEN THEY WERE VOTING ON THE CONVENTION RULES, AND THE CHAIRMAN ACTUALLY DECIDED WHO WON BY WHO SHOUTED LOUDER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S TRUE. IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT THEY'RE DECIDING CONVENTION RULES THE SAME WAY THEY DECIDE WHERE TO FIRE THE T-SHIRT CANNON AT BASKETBALL GAMES. WHO WANTS IT MORE? WHO WANTS IT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ YOU WANT IT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ YEAH, YOU WANT IT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHO WANTS IT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU REALLY WANT IT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ] TAKE CARE. I GUESS IT GOT SO CRAZY THAT AT ONE POINT THE CONVENTION CHAIRMAN ACTUALLY LEFT THE STAGE. LISTEN TO UTAH SENATOR MIKE LEE TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN REAL-TIME.
I REALLY HAVE NOTHING -- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. THIS IS SURREAL. I MEAN, THE CHAIR WALKED OFF THE STAGE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TRYING TO DESCRIBE THE MUSICAL "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST," THE CHAIR JUST WALKED OFF THE STAGE, AND PLATES AND FORKS AND KNIVES ARE SINGING WITH THE CANDLES. ♪ BE OUR GUEST BE OUR GUEST PUT OUR SERVICE TO THE TEST ♪ ♪ TIE YOUR NAPKIN 'ROUND YOUR NECK, CHERIE AND WE'LL PROVIDE THE REST ♪ OF COURSE, THE DEMOCRATS ARE GETTING READY FOR THEIR OWN CONVENTION NEXT WEEK, AND HILLARY CLINTON HAS TO BE FEELING PRETTY GOOD. RIGHT NOW THE "NEW YORK TIMES" ACTUALLY SAYS THAT HILLARY HAS A 76% CHANCE OF WINNING THE ELECTION. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HILLARY SAID SHE'S EXCITED ABOUT THE NEWS AND CAN'T WAIT TO FIND A NEW WAY TO BLOW IT. [ LAUGHTER ] HILLARY WAS ACTUALLY CAMPAIGNING IN LAS VEGAS TODAY, WHICH IS CRAZY, 'CAUSE USUALLY WHEN HILLARY GAMBLES IT INVOLVES NATIONAL SECURITY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HEY! OH!
Jimmy: FINALLY, GUYS, IF YOU'RE WATCHING THESE CONVENTIONS, YOU MIGHT WANNA CHECK OUT THE LOWER THIRD BANNERS THAT THEY USE TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THE SPEAKERS. LAST NIGHT IN CLEVELAND, THEY HAD SOME LIKE SITCOM STAR AND CALVIN KLEIN UNDERWEAR MODEL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN. SEE IF YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THESE. THEY'RE PRETTY CREATIVE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

THEY ALWAYS WERE THINKING IT WAS A JOKE. I'M LIKE, NO, YOU REALLY ONLY HAVE A DAY.
Jimmy: WE'VE BEEN ON 14 SEASONS, WATCH THE SHOW! YOU'RE GONNA BE ON.
THEY THOUGHT I ALWAYS SAY THIS FOR TELEVISION PURPOSES TO KIND OF LIKE MAKE IT CRAZY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
MEANWHILE, I WOULD HAVE THE WHOLE THING ALREADY MAPPED OUT, I WOULD KNOW HOW TO MAKE A A GOWN, A SUIT, A THIS, A THAT, AND THEN I BE LIKE, BAM, BAM, BAM.
Jimmy: AND IF YOU GO ON A A COOKING SHOW KNOW HOW TO MAKE RISOTTO.
RIGHT?
Jimmy: THAT'S THE THING. THAT'S WHERE THEY ALWAYS GET YOU. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE RISOTTO, DONKEY! YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO DO THAT STUFF.
RIGHT?
Jimmy: "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT," THOUGH, ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. WHO KNOWS.
SO MUCH FUN.
Jimmy: SIMON COWELL'S BACK, WHO I LOVE.

Jimmy: DOES THAT UP YOUR JUDGES SKILLS WHE YOUR JUDGING NEXT TO SIMON?
I THINK I AM THE SAME. I WOULD PROBABLY SAY I'M THE MOST HONEST.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I THOUGHT HE WAS MUCH HARSHER TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, BUT HE'S NOT REALLY AS HARSH. WE HAVE A LOT OF FUN TOGETHER, I I HAVE TO SAY.
Jimmy: HE'S HARSH.
AND WHEN HE GETS NAUGHTY, THEN HE GETS THE DRINK SPILLED ALL OVER HIM. BECAUSE, I'M NOT TAKING IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I LIKE PUT WHIPPED CREAM ON HIM ALREADY, ONE TIME, BECAUSE I FELL INTO THIS THING. OR, IF HE GETS MAD WITH ME, I DUMP MY WATER ON HIM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IF YOU HAD TO DO A A TALENT, WHAT WOULD YOURS TALENT BE BESIDES MODELING? WOULD YOU SING? WOULD YOU SING A SONG?
I CAN SING, BUT NOT WELL. I SING IN THE SHOWER. USUALLY PEOPLE CLOSE THEIR EARS WHEN I DO.
