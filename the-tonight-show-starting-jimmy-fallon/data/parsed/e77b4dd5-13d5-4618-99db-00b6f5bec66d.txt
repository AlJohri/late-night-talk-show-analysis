Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY. I CAN FEEL THE ENERGY HERE. THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE AT THE SHOW. YOU ARE THE SHOW. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. IT'S THE BIG "NEW YORK TIMES" EXPOSE ON DONALD TRUMP THAT REVEALS WHAT THEY FEAR IS SOME PRETTY QUESTIONABLE INTERACTIONS WITH WOMEN. INCLUDING CLAIMS THAT WHEN TRUMP RAN THE MISS USA PAGEANT, HE WOULD FREQUENTLY RATE WOMEN'S APPEARANCES RIGHT TO THEIR FACES WHILE THEY JUST STOOD THERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS REALLY SEXIST. AND ALSO PRETTY MUCH THE DEFINITION OF ANY BEAUTY PAGEANT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY KIND OF -- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS, RIGHT? YOU'RE THE RUNNER UP. THE ARTICLE MAKES THE POINT THAT DONALD TRUMP'S HIRED MANY WOMEN TO RUN HIS BUSINESSES AND EVEN QUOTES HIM AS SAYING, "A GOOD WOMAN IS BETTER THAN TEN GOOD MEN." [ LAUGHTER ] AND HILLARY WAS LIKE, "THANKS FOR THE NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] APPRECIATE THAT. I OWE YOU. THANKS, MAN." MEANWHILE, A RESTAURANT IN LITHUANIA IS STIRRING UP CONTROVERSY BY DISPLAYING A A MURAL ON ITS WALL THAT SHOWS DONALD TRUMP KISSING VLADIMIR PUTIN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TRUMP SAID HE'S NOT MAD THAT IT SHOWS HIM KISSING A MAN, HE'S MAD THAT IT SHOWS HIM KISSING SOMEONE OVER 40. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I DON'T LIKE IT. NO. TAKE IT DOWN. BUILD A DIFFERENT WALL. DIFFERENT WALL." [ LAUGHTER ] BORED OF THE FIRST ONE. GET THIS, IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, BEN CARSON SUGGESTED THAT DONALD TRUMP IS CONSIDERING SARAH PALIN AS HIS RUNNING MATE. AMERICA IS LIKE, "HEY, IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS, WE MIGHT AS WELL DO THIS, RIGHT?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. LET'S JUST GO FOR IT, YEAH.
Jimmy: OOH, THIS ISN'T GOOD HERE. AT THE NEVADA DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION THIS WEEKEND, A FIGHT BROKE OUT BETWEEN SUPPORTERS OF HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT. THERE WERE NPR TOTE BAGS EVERYWHERE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, THIS WAS A NIGHTMARE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SOURCES SAY IT WAS A CLOSE FIGHT BUT HILLARY SUPPORTERS WERE ABLE TO WIN BY 1%. OH, WOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S A LOCAL STORY. A GROUP OF ALLEGED MOBSTERS WERE JUST ARRESTED IN NEW YORK AND THEIR NICKNAMES INCLUDED GRANDPA, BALDY, LAZY EYE AND FAT SAL. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH ARE THE SAME NICKNAMES TRUMP GAVE HIS POSSIBLE RUNNING MATES. [ LAUGHTER ] "LAZY EYE. BALDY." LET'S GET TO SOME SPORTS, HERE. LAST NIGHT WAS THE FIRST GAME OF THE NHL'S CONFERENCE FINAL BETWEEN THE SAN JOSE SHARKS AND THE ST. LOUIS BLUES. AND TWO PLAYERS GOT INTO A A FIGHT. IT WAS PRETTY UNUSUAL. I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS. CHECK THIS OUT.
IN FRONT OF THE BENCH RIGHT HERE. DAVID BACKES AND JOE THORNTON. BOTH GUYS GRABBING EACH OTHER'S BEARDS. JOE SAYING MINE IS BIGGER. DAVID'S LIKE MINE'S GROWING.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S SORT OF HOW I IMAGINE LUMBERJACKS SAYING HELLO. "HEY, HOW'S IT GOING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] PULL EACH OTHERS BEARDS.
BRAWNY!
Jimmy: OH, THIS IS NICE HERE. I SAW THAT CAROLINA PANTHERS QUARTERBACK CAM NEWTON WILL STAR IN A NEW NICKELODEON SHOW HELPING KIDS ACHIEVE THEIR LIFELONG DREAMS. OR, ALMOST ACHIEVE THEIR LIFELONG DREAMS BUT THEN BLOW IT WHEN THE PRESSURE'S ON. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: OH, HEY. OH.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW YOU LIKED THAT ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, GUYS, I SAW "THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE" COMES OUT THIS WEEKEND. YEAH, THEY'RE SAYING THE BIRDS IN THE MOVIE ARE ANGRY BECAUSE, MOSTLY BECAUSE THE MOVIE DIDN'T COME OUT TWO YEARS AGO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE FILMING "STAR WARS" IN IRELAND WHEN DARTH VADER IS, "LUKE, I AM YOUR FATHER AND HER FATHER AND HIS FATHER AND HIS FATHER, TOO. THESE CHILDREN OVER HERE, WE HAD A THING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS INTERESTING HERE. I READ THAT THE U.S. CURRENTLY HAS THE LARGEST NUMBER OF OLDER WORKERS IN HISTORY, WITH 12% SAYING THEY DON'T EVER PLAN ON RETIRING. YEAH. HERE'S WHAT A FEW OF THEM HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT. FIRST WORKER SAID, "YOU DON'T JUST STOP BEING A FORKLIFT OPERATOR BECAUSE YOU COULD NO LONGER SEE OR HEAR PROPERLY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: RIGHT.
Jimmy: THIS NEXT WORKER SAID, "I'M NOT GOING TO LET A A LITTLE THING LIKE TURNING 87 KEEP ME FROM BEING A -- WHAT AM I AGAIN? OH, YEAH, COMMERCIAL AIRLINE PILOT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, THIS LAST PERSON SAID, "SCREW RETIRING. I'M STILL TRYING TO GET MY JOB." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS.

Jimmy: YEAH, YOU AND ANDY WON.
THANK YOU. ANDY? WHERE'S ANDY? ♪♪
Jimmy: OH MAN, I GOT TO HAVE BRYCE BACK. WE GOT TO PLAY AGAIN AND REALLY UNDERSTAND THE RULES.
MY ADRENALINE IS RUNNING SO HIGH RIGHT NOW. I'M TRYING TO SIT STILL AND IT'S REALLY HARD.
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. I APPRECIATE IT.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: OH PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. I HAVE A LOT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. ONE, IS YOU'RE DOING YOUR OWN LINE, YOUR FASHION LINE WITH TOMMY HILFIGER.
IT'S CRAZY. I STARTED DESIGNING THE LINE ALMOST A YEAR AGO, SO NOW IT'S LIKE, I'M KIND OF OVER IT -- NO, I'M KIDDING, I'M NOT OVER IT. I'M JUST REALLY EXCITED. I WANT PEOPLE TO SEE IT AND LIKE, WEAR IT, AND I'M JUST SO EXCITED.
Jimmy: WHEN DOES IT COME OUT? WHEN CAN WE SEE IT?
SO IT'S OUT SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR, AND IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE SHOW, IN TOMMY HILFIGER'S SHOW AT NEW YORK FASHION WEEK, AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUY IT RIGHT AFTER THE SHOW, SO WE'RE SPEEDING IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: THIS IS A GIANT THING. THIS IS PRETTY MAJOR. THIS IS AS BIG AS IT GETS, REALLY.
IT'S CRAZY. LIKE, I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR THE ARTISTS AND THE DESIGNERS THAT I WORK WITH THAT I DON'T WANT TO CALL MYSELF A A DESIGNER. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE CLOTHES FOR PEOPLE THAT FOLLOW ME AND FOR FANS OF TOMMY HILFIGRR THAT, YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF BRINGS THE EAST COAST AND WEST COAST TOGETHER. SO I'M REALLY EXCITED.
Jimmy: YOU'RE VERY YOUNG. I MEAN, YOU'RE 21, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU JUST HAD A A BIG BIRTHDAY. YEAH, 21.
YEAH, WE CAN HAVE TEQUILA AFTER THIS IF YOU WANT, IF YOU'RE THAT KIND OF --
Jimmy: SURE, UH --
I CAN SAY THAT. IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER TALKED ABOUT IT ON TV. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS. YEAH, YEAH. I'M MUCH OLDER NOW. BUT WHAT DID YOU DO -- WHAT DO YOU DO FOR 21?
SO ACTUALLY, ON MY ACTUAL BIRTHDAY, I SPENT AT THE BEACH WITH MY FAMILY.
Jimmy: THAT'S NICE.
YEAH. AND SO I ACTUALLY DIDN'T DRINK ON MY 21st BIRTHDAY. BUT, THE WEEK LATER I WENT TO VEGAS, AND --
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
AND MY BOYFRIEND TAUGHT ME HOW TO PLAY --
Jimmy: THAT JUST COMES ON THE PLANE OUT THERE.
YOU HAVE TO DO IT. YOU HAVE TO DO VEGAS ON YOUR 21st BIRTHDAY. MY BOYFRIEND TAUGHT ME HOW TO PLAY POKER THE NIGHT BEFORE I WENT TO VEGAS, SO I WON $400. VERY EXCITED.
Jimmy: DID YOU REALLY?
ON A $15 POKER TABLE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. OR BLACKJACK. IT WAS BLACKJACK. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NERVOUS. LIKE, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WRONG GAME. YEAH, IT WAS BLACKJACK.
Jimmy: SO IT'S BLACKJACK, NOT POKER.
IT WAS BLACKJACK.
Jimmy: THAT IS A TYPE OF POKER, YEAH?
IS IT?
Jimmy: NO. SORRY. WE DON'T BELONG AT A CASINO.
WE'RE JUST GONNA STAY HERE.
Jimmy: WE MAY BE THE WORST PEOPLE TO GO TO A CASINO. I JUST PLAY SLOT MACHINES WITH MY PARENTS.
PERFECT.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE EVEN. BLACKJACK AND POKER. POKER'S FIVE CARDS, NO? AND YOU HOLD IT.
BLACKJACK'S 21.
Jimmy: OH YEAH, I'M GOOD AT 21.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, LIKE I CAN PLAY RIGHT NOW.
OKAY, COOL.
Jimmy: READY FOR THIS?
WANT TO PLAY?
Jimmy: READY? YEAH, HERE'S YOUR CARDS. YOU GOT A TEN AND A THREE.
HIT ME.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO, YOU BUSTED. [ LAUGHTER ] 400 BUCKS, PAL. THIS IS THE BEST. I LIKE PLAYING WITH YOU.
THIS IS A $400 TABLE?
Jimmy: WANT TO GO DOUBLE OR NOTHING?
OKAY, YEAH, SURE. LET'S DO IT.
Jimmy: YOU CAN DO THIS ALL NIGHT, MAN, YEAH. I'M NOT A GOOD GAMBLER EITHER. SO I'M GLAD. DID YOU GET IT OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM?
NO.
Jimmy: NO, REALLY?
I'M JUST NOT GOING TO GO BACK TO VEGAS. I'LL STICK WITH MONOPOLY OR SOMETHING.
Jimmy: YEAH, FAKE GAMBLING. YEAH, DON'T DO THAT. YOU GOT THIS BIG LINE COMING OUT. THAT WILL BE EXCITING. BUT 21, IT'S A BIG, BIG, BIG THING FOR YOU. AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY. AND I DIDN'T WANT TO DO A SHOT, BUT I HAVE A MOTTO HERE THAT YOU SAID. YOU SAID, "EAT CLEAN TO STAY FIT. EAT A BURGER TO STAY SANE."
YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING I GO BY RELIGIOUSLY IN MY LIFE.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT. BUT THEN YOU THINK THAT YOU FOUND THE BEST BURGER PLACE.
YEAH, SO MY BEST FRIEND AND I MOVED TO NEW YORK, WELL, SHE WASN'T MY BEST FRIEND YET, SHE WAS FROM AUSTRALIA. WE MOVED TO NEW YORK THE SAME WEEK AND MET. AND WE DECIDED WE WERE GOING TO TRY A NEW BURGER EVERY WEEK AND FIND THE BEST BURGER IN NEW YORK. SO MY FIRST YEAR IN NEW YORK, THAT'S WHAT I DID.
Jimmy: AND DO YOU THINK YOU FOUND THE BEST ONE?
IT'S J.G. MELON'S UPTOWN.
Jimmy: J.G. MELON, YOU SNAPCHATTED IT YESTERDAY.
LAST NIGHT. I HAD IT FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND SO WE GOT TWO BURGERS FROM J.G. MELON RIGHT HERE, AND I FIGURED -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YES!
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU GET ON IT? WHAT'S YOUR GO TO JUICY, HEAVY BURGER?
THE THING ABOUT J.G. MELLON IS THEY'RE JUST LIKE, SUPER SIMPLE. YOU KNOW, THEY JUST DON'T TRY TOO HARD, AND IT'S SO GOOD. SO IT COMES WITH ALL THE VEGGIES. I DON'T DO TOMATOES.
Jimmy: VEGGIES. YEAH, I GUESS.
I DON'T DO TOMATOES.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW IF I'D CALL THEM VEGGIES IF THEY'RE ON A BURGER.
