YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND CONGRATS ON ALL THIS. DID THIS RECORD COME OUT -- AM I WRONG? DID IT COME OUT ON THE WRONG DAY OR SOMETHING OR WEEK?
WE ACTUALLY RELEASED THE EDITED VERSION, SO EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT I DIDN'T CUSS NO MORE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME FOR A COUPLE YEARS. I LOST HALF MY AUDIENCE. YEAH, EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NO, GOSH, IT'S JUST CRAZY, CRAZY, CRAZY FUN REVIEWS AND CRAZY GOOD. I SAW IT, LIKE, OBVIOUSLY ALL OVER THE INTERNET, PEOPLE TRYING TO SING LIKE YOU AND RAP LIKE YOU. THERE'S THIS ONE KID THAT PUT OUT A THING, THEY MIXED MARIO KART THEME WITH YOUR -- WITH "SWIMMING POOL." AND THEY CALLED IT "KENDRICK LAMARIO KART." [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE LISTEN TO THIS. THIS DESERVES A LITTLE GRAMMY NOM, TOO, MAYBE. LISTEN. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S ENOUGH. THAT'S ENOUGH. THAT'S ENOUGH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ANYWAY. YOU'RE NOMINATED FOR SEVEN GRAMMYS. ISN'T THAT GREAT? ISN'T THAT AWESOME? YEAH. YOU MUST HAVE HEARD THAT BEFORE. HAVE YOU HEARD IT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M SURPRISED HOW YOU ALL KEPT THE TEMPO.
Jimmy: YEAH. ARE YOU A VIDEO GAME GUY?
YEAH, I USED TO BE. I GOT SO INTO MUSIC, AND I DABBLED OUT OF IT A LITTLE BIT. I WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS BLOWING ON THE CARTRIDGES ON SEGA. -- YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, YOU GOT TO DO THAT. THAT'S HOW YOU FIX THE GAME. THAT'S HOW YOU FIX THE WHOLE SYSTEM.
THAT'S FOR OLD-SCHOOL. MY GENERATION OF OLD-SCHOOL. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: SEGA WAS IT? GENESIS?
NINTENDO, SEGA.
Jimmy: SEGA GENESIS.
I JUST MISSED ATARI. WE JUST MISSED THAT. I'M 87.
Jimmy: THAT'S ME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I WAS ATARI.
OKAY.
Jimmy: I WAS INTO, LIKE, VIC-20 BEFORE THAT WHICH IS NOT EVEN A REAL THING. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN I WENT TO ATARI, BUT THEN THE PEOPLE HAD COLECOVISION.
YEAH, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A BABY. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU WEREN'T EVEN REMOTELY BORN YET. BUT COLECO, THEN IT WENT -- NOW NO VIDEO GAMES FOR YOU. HOW DO YOU BLOW OFF STEAM?
HOW DO I BLOW OFF STEAM? I RAP A LOT.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S IT.
LOT OF RAP.
Jimmy: YEAH, LOT OF RAP.
YEAH.
Jimmy: TARIQ, YOU LIKE THAT, TOO?
Tariq: IT'S ALL I DO, MAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
COME ON, HE'S A LEGEND. THAT'S ALL HE DO.
Jimmy: I MEAN, COME ON. THAT'S BLACK THOUGHT. THE ROOTS.
YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT GUY.
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MY FAVORITE RAPPER.
COME ON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE GETS EMBARRASSED. HE GETS EMBARRASSED. YEAH, HE GETS EMBARRASSED. "TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY." LET ME GO THROUGH THIS. YOU RELEASE THIS RECORD. IT COMES OUT. IT'S THE BIGGEST THING EVER. YOU WERE GREAT ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE," BY THE WAY.
APPRECIATE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. IT WAS SO GOOD. SO DIFFERENT, AND SO WELL DONE. IT WAS JUST FANTASTIC. YOU GOT MOST GRAMMY NOMINATIONS FOR A RAPPER IN A YEAR. YOU MADE HISTORY ALREADY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WIN ANYTHING, YOU ALREADY WON. YOU UNDERSTAND? I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH. MICHAEL JACKSON HOLDS THE RECORD WITH 12 NOMINATIONS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU ALMOST HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF NOMINATIONS AS MICHAEL JACKSON FOR "THRILLER."
THE LEGEND. I WOULDN'T WANT TO GO PAST THAT, THOUGH.
Jimmy: NO. BUT WHAT IF YOU HAD 13?
NO. I'D TAKE BACK. I CAN'T FATHOM BEING AS GREAT AS MICHAEL WITHOUT PUTTING OUT THE WORK. SO 11 IS PERFECT. YOU KNOW, HE'S THE LEGENDARY. I'M GLAD --
Jimmy: WHAT HAPPENS, SAY YOU DO GET 13? KENDRICK, LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT ALMOST HAPPENED. I MEAN, THEN WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO? JUST GOT TO --
I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: JUST GOT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. [ LAUGHTER ] FIGURE OUT SOMETHING ELSE. BUT THEN, ALL THE SAMPLES ON HERE ARE FANTASTIC AS WELL. ALL THEM, I THINK, ARE FROM EITHER 1974 OR 1975. WHAT DID YOU END UP -- WHY THOSE YEARS?
THOSE ARE THE RECORDS THAT MY PARENTS PLAYED WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. IN THE '90s THEY PLAYED NOTHING BUT THE ISLEY BROTHERS, THE TEMPTATIONS, ALL THE WAY THROUGH GANGSTER RAP, DR. DRE, SNOOP DOGG. SO THAT WAS THE INFLUENCE. I SAID MY FIRST ALBUM I DEBUTED, I WANTED TO MAKE AN ALBUM LIKE THIS, BUT I WASN'T CONFIDENT ENOUGH. SO I HAD TO GO BACK AND SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT TO DO IT THIS TIME AROUND."
Jimmy: WOW, YOU REALLY DID IT, MAN. THE CONFIDENCE PAID OFF, MAN.
APPRECIATE IT.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH. 11 NOMS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S WELL DESERVED, DUDE. THE HARD WORK PAID OFF. KENDRICK LAMAR, IS THE BIGGEST NAME IN MUSIC. HE'S ABOUT TO PERFORM FOR US AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
