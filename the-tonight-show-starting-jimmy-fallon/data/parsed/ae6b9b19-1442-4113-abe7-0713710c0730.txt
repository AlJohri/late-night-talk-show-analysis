I'M GLAD TO BE HERE, AND I'M GLAD IT'S ST. PADDY'S DAY. HAD I COME IN FROM LOS ANGELES INSTEAD OF TORONTO, I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT YOU A LUCKY THREE-LEAF CLOVER.

Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU LOOK GREAT, I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE, I LIKE THE NEW GLASSES. DO YOU ALWAYS WEAR GLASSES? DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR GLASSES?
I'VE WORN GLASSES ALL MY LIFE, ACTUALLY BECAUSE THERE'S A LENS IN HERE. SEE, I HAVE A LAZY EYE. AND I --
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK YOU CAN REALLY TELL.
THESE LENSES. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT THESE LENSES DO, IS IT CORRECTS THAT LAZY EYE, SO THAT'S WHY I WEAR THEM.

NOW, I CAN'T READ -- [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T READ ANYTHING, IF I DON'T HAVE THESE GLASSES ON.
Jimmy: I DON'T GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
I GOT MORE DATES WHEN I WORE THEM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ARE YOU SURE -- MAYBE YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD MORE DATES WHEN YOU HAD THEM OFF, MAYBE THEY'RE LIKE -- I'M DATING TWINS.
I COULDN'T GET ONE DATE -- WHEN I DIDN'T WEAR THEM.
Jimmy: AND NOT WITH GLASSES YOU HAVE THEM ON AND HERE YOU ARE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE TO NEW YORK. I KNOW, YEAH, YOU'RE COMING HERE ALL THE WAY FROM CANADA, YOU KNOW I'M A GIANT FAN OF YOURS. WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU, PROBABLY SCTV. AND THEN I REMEMBER YOU WERE IN A SPECIAL ON HBO WITH BILLY CRYSTAL, "DON'T GET ME STARTED." YOU REMEMBER THIS? THIS WAS COMEDY --
MID '80s.
Jimmy: GOSH, YOU WERE SO GOOD. YEAH. WHAT WAS I DOING ON IT?
Jimmy: YOU WERE HIS AGENT. MORTY, I WANT TO SAY.
MORTY? CLOSE. THAT'S PROBABLY IT.
Jimmy: WAS IT MORTY?
HONESTLY, I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I DID ON THE SHOW.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO WATCH, YOU'RE REALLY FUNNY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HAVE TO SEE, IT'S GREAT.
WELL, SOMETIMES I NEED TO HEAR IS IT, BECAUSE I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU ABSOLUTELY DO.
THAT'S HOW HUMBLE I AM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU ACTUALLY TELL PEOPLE, I'M VERY HUMBLE.
YEAH. YEAH.
Jimmy: LET'S TALK ABOUT "SCHITT'S CREEK." HOW DID YOU GET AWAY WITH THIS TITLE?
WELL, HERE'S THE THING, "SCHITT'S CREEK" IS ACTUALLY -- THE NAME SCHITT, IS ACTUALLY -- I MEAN IT'S A REAL NAME. AND SPEAKING OF ST. PADDY'S DAY, IT IS AN IRISH NAME. IN FACT, I THINK THERE'S A A LITTLE HAMLET IN IRELAND THAT IS ACTUALLY CALLED "SCHITT'S CREEK" WHICH WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT UNTIL JUST RECENTLY.
Jimmy: REALLY?
SO WHEN WE SAID IT'S A REAL NAME. THEY SAID, THIS WAS ORIGINALLY, IT WAS UP IN -- WE SHOOT THE SHOW IN CANADA. SO THE CBC UP IN CANADA SAID, "LISTEN, IF THERE'S A A LEGITIMATE NAME, THERE'S NO WAY IN THE WORLD WE CAN'T SHOW IT." AND THE SAME THING DOWN HERE WITH POP. THEY SAID, "LISTEN, IT'S SOMEBODY'S NAME, THERE WE GO." I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE HAPPY ABOUT IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT, YOU KNOW, WE ACTUALLY WENT TO PHONE BOOKS AND TORE PAGES WITH THE NAME SCHITT IN DIFFERENT CITIES, RIGHT -- AND WE PHOTO COPIED IT AND SENT IT TO THEM, AND --
Jimmy: IT'S REAL?
YEAH, IT'S ABSOLUTELY REAL.
Jimmy: AND SO THE PREMISE OF THE SHOW I LOVE, IT'S YOU, IT'S KATHERINE O'HARA. YOUR SON IS ACTUALLY IN IT, HE'S VERY FUNNY.
KATHERINE IS BRILLIANT THE IN THE SHOW. MY SON DANIEL IS --
Jimmy: HOW COOL IS THAT TO WORK WITH YOUR SON?
IT'S PRETTY, PRETTY DAMN COOL. CAN YOU SAY DAMN?
Jimmy: NO, UNLESS IT'S A A LAST NAME, WE CAN'T SAY IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS IS PROBABLY IS A LAST NAME --
WE'LL PROBABLY BLEEP IT. BUT -- NO, NO, HE'S FANTASTIC. WE HAVE A GREAT CAST. I'M SO PROUD OF THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW, WE --
Jimmy: SORRY.
I'M DAMN PROUD OF THIS SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] DAMN PROUD OF THE SHOW.
Jimmy: YOU CAN ACTUALLY SAY THAT.
I'M SO DAMN PROUD. NO, NO, NO. HONESTLY IT'S A GREAT SHOW, AND IT'S A FUNNY SHOW.
Jimmy: IT'S A RICH FAMILY THAT ACTUALLY BOUGHT THIS PLACE CALLED --
YEAH, "SCHITT'S CREEK" IS A A TOWN, AND I PLAY -- I PLAY A A GUY WHO BOUGHT THIS TOWN AS A A JOKE FOR HIS SON FOR HIS SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY, BECAUSE THE TOWN WAS CALLED "SCHITT'S CREEK." AND NOW THE ONLY THING THEY CAN DO SINCE THEY'VE LOST EVERYTHING, THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IS "SCHITT'S CREEK." AND THAT'S KIND OF THE PREMISE OF THE SHOW.
Jimmy: I GOT TO ASK ABOUT CHRIS ELLIOTT. I LOVE HIM --
CHRIS ELLIOT'S IN THE SHOW. ONE OF THE FUNNIEST GUYS I KNOW.
Jimmy: HE IS REALLY UNBELIEVABLY GOOD. HE'S THE MAYOR, AND WHAT IS THE MAYOR'S NAME AGAIN?
