Questlove: 554!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, WELCOME. THANK YOU! ENJOY YOURSELF, ENJOY YOURSELF. WELCOME. THANK YOU, GUYS. THAT MEANS A LOT. THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME. THAT'S A HOT CROWD RIGHT THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A HOT -- THAT'S A HOT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE PART OF IT. THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THE THIRD AND FINAL DEBATE BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP IS COMING UP IN LAS VEGAS NEXT WEEK. THAT'S RIGHT, AND I SAW THAT HILLARY'S HOLDING A CONTEST WHERE THE WINNER GETS TO ACTUALLY GO WATCH IT IN PERSON. [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYONE WAS LIKE, "YEESH, WHAT DOES THE LOSER GET?" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHO WANTS TO DO THAT? BUT HILLARY'S STILL DEALING WITH ALL THESE LEAKED E-MAILS THAT ARE REVEALING ALL KINDS OF STUFF. FOR INSTANCE, ONE OF THE E-MAILS SHOWS THAT HILLARY CLINTON DOESN'T GET ALONG WITH CHELSEA'S MOTHER-IN-LAW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE HAVE HEARD SHE DOESN'T GET ALONG WITH HER IN-LAWS, THEY THOUGHT, "HUH, MAYBE SHE IS RELATABLE." NO, NOT -- TO MY IN-LAWS, I LOVE YOU GUYS. WIKILEAKS ALSO REVEALED THAT FORMER ASTRONAUT, EDGAR MITCHELL, WANTED TO MEET WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN TO DISCUSS ALIEN LIFE. AND HILLARY WAS LIKE, "TRUST ME, IF THERE WERE ALIENS, I ALREADY WOULD HAVE ASKED THEM FOR MONEY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "DEAR ZORB, WE'RE STILL TRYING TO REACH OUR GOAL." BUT THE BEST E-MAIL THAT'S BEEN LEAKED SO FAR CLAIMS THAT HILLARY MET WITH RAPPER Q-TIP LAST YEAR TO DISCUSS HOW TO APPEAL TO HIP-HOP FANS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THE BIG TAKE AWAY FOR HILLARY: WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TRY TO RAP. IT'S LIKE -- ♪ H TO THE I TO THE L TO THE OTHER L TO THE A TO THE R TO THE Y ♪ ♪ AND THAT SPELLS HILLARY THAT'S MY NAME AND RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS MY GAME ♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ FEEDBACK ]
Jimmy: I GUESS THE MEETING WITH Q-TIP REALLY AFFECTED HILLARY, BECAUSE AFTERWARDS, SHE ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH SOME RAPPER NAMES FOR HERSELF.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH. FIRST, SHE TRIED LI'L WHEEZY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN SHE TRIED RUN D.N.C. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, SHE TRIED WIZ DELEETA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ YOU HAVE TO GIVE HER CREDIT FOR TRYING.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, I SAW THAT TWO FUND-RAISING EVENTS FEATURING DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE, MIKE PENCE, WERE CANCELED THIS WEEK BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INTEREST. YOU KNOW, ON THE PART OF MIKE PENCE. HE'S LIKE, "OH, YEAH, I GOT TO DO THIS OTHER THING." I SAW THAT A TRUMP SUPPORTER INTERVIEWED BY CBS NEWS SAID SHE'S WORRIED IF HILLARY CLINTON GETS ELECTED THAT SHE'LL BAN THE PHRASE "MERRY CHRISTMAS." WELL, HILLARY'S ACTUALLY PROGRAMMED HER PHONE TO SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS WHENEVER SHE GETS A NEWS ALERT ABOUT TRUMP. IT'S LIKE, "MERRY CHRISTMAS. HA-HA HOO-WEE!" [ APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF TRUMP, HE BROUGHT UP THE PROSPECT OF LOSING THE ELECTION THIS WEEK, SAYING, "IF I DON'T WIN, IT WILL BE THE SINGLE GREATEST WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY, AND MONEY." THEN THE GUY WHO CAME UP WITH SKECHERS SHAPE-UPS WAS LIKE, "EH, SECOND GREATEST." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS ] ♪♪
Steve: SHAPE-UPS.
Jimmy: BUT THE BIG STORY TODAY IS THAT TRUMP SAID HE'S PREPARING A LAWSUIT AGAINST "THE NEW YORK TIMES" FOR ITS RECENT ARTICLES ABOUT HIM. TRUMP SAYS WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS WRONG, AND HE'S ALSO ONE LAWSUIT AWAY FROM A FREE ONE ON HIS LAWYER'S PUNCH CARD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MIGHT AS WELL TRY. THIS IS REALLY SURPRISING. A NEW POLL SHOWS THAT AN INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE NAMED EVAN McMULLIN IS ACTUALLY IN A A THREE-WAY TIE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON IN THE STATE OF UTAH. MAKING THE ONLY TIME YOU'LL EVER HEAR "UTAH" AND "THREE-WAY" IN THE SAME SENTENCE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S JUST VERY INTERESTING. ♪♪ I SAW THAT'S THE UNITED NATIONS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE NAMING WONDER WOMAN AS A NEW HONORARY AMBASSADOR FOR EMPOWERING WOMEN AND GIRLS. [ SCATTERED CHEERS ] AND MICHELLE OBAMA SAID, "YEAH, GO WITH THE CARTOON." YEAH, THAT'S -- [ APPLAUSE ] PERFECT. THAT'S -- NO ONE -- NO REAL WOMEN OUT THERE TO -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, THINGS AREN'T GETTING ANY BETTER FOR SAMSUNG. I SAW THAT NOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY SENDING CUSTOMERS SAFETY GLOVES TO HELP THEM RETURN THE EXPLODING PHONES. AND THEY'RE LIKE, HOLD UP. TURNS OUT THE GLOVES ARE EXPLODING TOO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M SORRY, HOW DO WE MAKE AN EXPLODING -- WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS!
