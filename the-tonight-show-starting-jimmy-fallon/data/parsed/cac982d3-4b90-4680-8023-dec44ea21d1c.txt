SEE THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT EMBARRASSES ME AS AN AMERICAN. COMPETITIVE EATING IS NOW A A SPORT IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY COVER IT ON ESPN. THIS IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE EATING 300 CHICKEN WINGS MAKES YOU AN ATHLETE NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN DON'T YOU FIND THAT IRONIC? COMPETITIVE EATING IS A SPORT, YET SOMEHOW, WE STILL CAN'T QUITE ACCEPT SOCCER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW? IT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE A A REAL SPORT LIKE EATING. HOW MANY, DO YOU LIKE SOCCER? HOW MANY WATCH SOCCER? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] A LOT OF AMERICANS THINK SOCCER IS BORING, BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, I WATCHED THAT LAST ROUND OF THE WORLD CUP. FOR THE FIRST HALF HOUR THE SCORE WAS WHAT, 0-0. I TURNED MY HEAD AWAY FOR JUST ONE HOUR AND BOOM, IT WAS 1-0. [ LAUGHTER ] WHOA! WHOA!

BUT LAWRENCE TAYLOR'S LAWYER SAID AFTER THE TRIAL, HE DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL. HE SAID HE MASTURBATED IN FRONT OF HER. SO I THINK WE ALL OWE MR. TAYLOR AN APOLOGY.

THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE WE DOING TONIGHT?
WE'RE JUMPING RIGHT -- SO WE'VE GOT HYDROGEN GAS. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT DENSITIES OF DIFFERENT GASES. SO WE'VE GOT THREE DIFFERENT GASES. HYDROGEN IS OUR FIRST ONE. HERE'S YOUR BEACH BALL. I'M GOING TO OPEN THIS UP. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS JUST KIND OF SQUEEZE IT AND LET IT GO. WE NEED A LOT OF GAS TO GET IN THAT. SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME BUBBLES. YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH HYDROGEN?
Jimmy: YES.
HYDROGEN IS LIGHTER THAN AIR. IT'S ABOUT 14 TIMES LIGHTER.
Jimmy: IS THIS WORKING? AM I DOING IT
IT'S WORKING.
Jimmy: IS THIS THE EXPERIMENT? WE'RE MAKING BUBBLES.
EVENTUALLY THOSE BUBBLES ARE GOING TO START TO GET SO LIGHT, FULL, OF THAT GAS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO FLY TO THE CEILING. AND I'VE GOT A CANDLE. REMEMBER THE HINDENBERG? IT DIDN'T END WELL FOR THE HINDENBERG. WE'RE GOING TO SEE HOW WELL WE DO TONIGHT. [ AUDIENCE WOWS ] WE DID PRETTY OKAY. BUT AT THE MUSEUM OF DISCOVERY WE'RE HANDS ON.
Jimmy: NO, NO, BE CAREFUL. BE CAREFUL, BE CAREFUL!
SO, WE'RE OKAY.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH. DON'T WORRY, WE'RE FINE. COME ON OVER. LOOK AT THIS. ISN'T THIS AMAZING?
THIS IS SAD. WHAT IS IT?
THIS IS A TANK FULL OF GAS. THERE'S SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE IN THERE. SO HYDROGEN'S LIGHTER THAN AIR. SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE IS A LOT HEAVIER THAN AIR. SO LET ME SHOW YOU.
Jimmy: SULFUR HEXAFLOURIDE.
YEAH, YEAH. THE FIRST THING I WANT TO DO, I GOT DRY ICE HERE. SO, HERE. TAKE THIS OFF AND THERE YOU GO. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS. SO I'M GOING TO POUR SOME DRY ICE. YOU KNOW DRY ICE?
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I'M JUST GOING TO POUR SOME OVER HERE AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. POURED A LITTLE BIT IN THERE. THAT'S OKAY. [ AUDIENCE WHOAS ] HEY, WAIT A SECOND, SOMETHING'S GOING ON IN THERE. LET ME GIVE YOU SOMETHING HERE. I GOT THIS BOAT. SEE IF YOU CAN FLOAT THAT IN THERE. MAKE IT LIKE SCOOBY DOO, KIND OF SPOOKY. NOW JUST GIVE THAT A LITTLE SAIL.
Jimmy: WOW. THAT'S AMAZING.
ISN'T THAT FUN? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S PRETTY COOL. IT'S ALSO NONTOXIC, SO YOU CAN BREATHE IT IN.
Jimmy: THANKS FOR TELLING ME THAT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
HERE'S ONE FOR YOU AND LUCY, I'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU, TOO. HERE YOU GO. YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND BREATHE THAT IN. I'VE GOT SOME HELIUM. YOU KNOW, HELIUM, YOU CAN BREATHE THAT IN TOO. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU BREATHE IN HELIUM? DO YOU REMEMBER?
Jimmy: YOUR VOICE GETS HIGH.
THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S A A LOT LIGHTER THAN AIR, SO ALL THE SOUND MOVES QUICKLY THROUGH IT. NOW, BREATHE THAT IN. THAT'S A LOT HEAVIER THAN AIR. IT'S ABOUT 5 TO 6 TIMES DENSER THAN AIR. SO, GO AHEAD AND SEE.
Jimmy: OH MY GOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
THERE YOU GO. SO -- YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING ELSE? I GOT ONE MORE THING.
Jimmy: OH MY GOD. THAT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED. OH, MY GOODNESS. CRAZY.
MOST OF THE GAS HAS LIKE --
Jimmy: I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED. IT'S LIKE BONAROO A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
THAT'S HOW I FOUND IT. I WAS AT BONAROO. I GOT A BUCKET HERE. NITROGEN GAS. NITROGEN MAKES UP ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE BREATHABLE AIR THAT'S AROUND US ALL THE TIME. BUT CONDENSED INTO A LIQUID, IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. OH, GLOVES. HERE PUT YOUR GLOVES ON.
Lucy: OH MY GOD.
THAT COULD HAVE GONE WRONG.
Jimmy: I'M GOING TO DO THIS ONE NOW.
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE GLOVES ON AND NITROGEN BOILS AS A LIQUID AT 321 DEGREES BELOW ZERO.
Jimmy: REALLY.
YOU CAN'T PUT YOUR FACE IN IT.
Lucy: EXPLODED.
Jimmy: BUMMER. FIRST THING I WAS GOING TO DO.
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT I'M SORRY TO RUIN THE PARTY. SO, JUST POUR IT RIGHT IN HERE.
Jimmy: YOU'RE DRIPPING IT EVERYWHERE.
THAT'S OKAY.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S GOING TO GET ON ME AND I'M AFRAID.
IT'S GONE ALREADY IT EVAPORATES CONSTANTLY BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BOILING. SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A CLOUD.
Jimmy: WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A A CLOUD.
TO HAVE A CLOUD, YOU NEED A A COUPLE OF THINGS. YOU NEED PARTICULATE MATTER, STUFF IN THE AIR. YOU NEED WATER VAPOR, AND I GOT WARM WATER OVER HERE. AND YOU NEED THIS. SO, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. I NEED YOU GUYS TO STAND BACK IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET WET. ARE YOU READY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A A CLOUD.
WE ALSO NEED A RAPID TEMPERATURE CHANGE, SO I'VE GOT SOME HOT WATER. YOU GUYS READY?
Jimmy: OKAY, WE'RE GONNA MAKE A CLOUD.
YOU GUYS READY? I NEED A DRUM ROLL. [ DRUMROLL ] THANKS, MAN. FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO -- [ AUDIENCE OHS ] ♪♪
