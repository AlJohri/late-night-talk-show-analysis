YEAH, KIND OF THAT CHARISMATIC -- I THOUGHT, "WELL, PRINCE MAYBE."
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. INTERESTING. YOU'RE A BIG PRINCE FAN?
I WAS. I ALWAYS WAS, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU WERE TELLING ME THAT YOU WERE GETTING YOUR SON INTO THE MUSIC, WHICH IS GREAT.
YEAH, WELL, HE STARTED REQUESTING IT. ACTUALLY WHAT HE'S BEEN REQUESTING IS PICTURES OF PRINCE. BECAUSE --
Jimmy: HE JUST LIKES LOOKING AT HIM.
HE LIKES -- WE GET ON THE PHONE AND HE JUST LIKE FLIPS THROUGH PICTURES OF PRINCE. [ LAUGHTER ] EVENTUALLY HE SAID, AFTER WE LOOKED AT A LOT OF PHOTOS, HE SAID -- HE SAID, "DOES HE HAVE MANY, MANY GUITARS?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND I SAID, "YOU GOT IT. YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE."
Jimmy: YEAH, HE HAS MANY, MANY, MANY GUITARS, ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. WELL, YOU'RE ON THIS SHOW. AND IT'S A HULU SHOW.
IT IS.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE A NEW TYPE OF WAY OF WATCHING TV AND DOING SHOWS. DO YOU LIKE WORKING WITH HULU?
I DO. YEAH, I DO, IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE. I THINK IT WAS THEIR FIRST DRAMA, YOU KNOW, ORIGINAL DRAMA. AND THEIR ATTITUDE SEEMED TO BE THEY GAVE JESSICA GOLDBERG, THE SHOW RUNNER, JUST, YOU KNOW -- RUN WITH IT, TAKE IT WHERE YOU WANT. AND IT'S BEEN FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: AARON PAUL AS WELL.
AARON PAUL.
Jimmy: "BREAKING BAD."
BREAKING --?
Jimmy: YOU EVER HEARD OF "BREAKING BAD"? YEAH. THE SHOW HE WAS ON?
NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT WAS A -- ANIMATED SITCOM. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS FUN. BUT THE IDEA OF THE SHOW IS INTERESTING. AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SET IT UP.
WELL, WE'RE A SMALL RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT, THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL OURSELVES. EVERYBODY ELSE CALLS US A CULT. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE RESIST THAT.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO.
OUR LEADER -- THE MOVEMENT IS CALLED, "MEYERISM." IT'S NAMED AFTER DR. STEVEN MEYERS. IF YOU'RE VERY HIGH UP IN THE MOVEMENT, LIKE ME, YOU CALL HIM STEVE. WE REALLY WORSHIP STEVE. AND HE'S KIND OF OUT OF THE PICTURE FOR REASONS THAT, YOU KNOW, I WON'T GIVE AWAY 'CAUSE IT'S KIND OF SPOILERS. BUT I'M ANGLING TO MAYBE TAKE THIS THING OVER. TAKE IT INTO THE NEXT GENERATION.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. HERE'S HUGH DANCY AND AARON PAUL FROM THE SITCOM "BREAKING BAD" --
THAT'S RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: -- IN THE SHOW "THE PATH." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE WALK. YOU CAN'T LIVE AMONG US, CALL YOURSELF A FOLLOWER, AND NOT BELIEVE. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. AND IF YOU FIND AFTER 250 MILES THAT YOU ARE STILL FAITHFUL -- KEEP WALKING. DON'T COME BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AH-HA -- HUGH DANCY! CHECK OUT "THE PATH" ON HULU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH COMEDIAN JACK WHITEHALL. YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE HIM, EVERYBODY. COME ON BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: JOINING US NOW IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR COMEDIANS IN THE U.K. AND IS CURRENTLY STARRING IN THE MOVIE "MOTHER'S DAY", WHICH IS IN THEATERS NOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE VERY FUNNY JACK WHITEHALL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
OH, GOOD EVENING, NEW YORK CITY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE THIS CITY. I LOVE THIS CITY, BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY CITY IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU ARE AS GRUMPY AS WE ARE IN BRITAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] THE MINUTE YOU GET OFF THE PLANE IT STARTS. EVEN THE GUY STAMPING THE PASSPORTS WAS TERRIFYING. NO WORD OF A LIE, HE WAS LIKE, "WHAT IS YOUR OCCUPATION?" I WAS LIKE, "COMEDIAN." "ARE YOU AS FUNNY AS JERRY SEINFELD?" "UH, NO?" "CORRECT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. YOU ALSO DRINK -- YOU DRINK LIKE WE DO IN BRITAIN. THAT'S GREAT. NOT LIKE L.A. I WENT TO L.A. I HEARD SENTENCES I'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE IN MY LIFE. SENTENCES LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, DID YOU SEE LARRY? LARRY HAD FOUR GLASSES OF WINE WITH DINNER. I THINK LARRY MAY BE AN ALCOHOLIC." [ LAUGHTER ] WOW. FOUR GLASSES OF WINE WITH DINNER IN L.A., YOU'RE AN ALCOHOLIC. FOUR GLASSES OF WINE WITH DINNER IN BRITAIN, YOU'RE THE DESIGNATED DRIVER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'VE BEEN COMPLIMENTED ON MY ACCENT HERE. THAT NEVER NORMALLY HAPPENS. SOMEONE SAID MY ACCENT WAS SEXY THE OTHER DAY. [ CHEERS ] NO, NO, NO. THIS IS NOT A VOICE YOU WANT TO HEAR IN THE BEDROOM, ALL RIGHT. I DON'T LIKE TALKING IN THE BEDROOM. I THINK THAT SEX SHOULD BE A A SWIFT, SILENT AND CLINICAL PROCEDURE, RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHENEVER I DO TALK, ALWAYS A A DISASTER. THE OTHER DAY, I WAS HAVING THE SEX. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YES. WITH MY GIRLFRIEND. NO, I WASN'T. SORRY. I JUST REMEMBERED, MY GIRLFRIEND SAID I COULD ONLY SAY THIS ON TV IF I SAID IT WAS A FRIEND OF MINE. A FRIEND OF MINE WAS HAVING SEX WITH MY GIRLFRIEND. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT GOT TO THAT BIT AT THE END, THAT LITTLE POST-COITAL MOMENT OF SILENCE WHERE SOMEONE HAS TO SAY SOMETHING. I SAID THE MOST BRITISH THING THAT HAS EVER BEEN SAID IN THE BEDROOM. I FINISHED AND WENT, "AH, WELL, BRAVO?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FIVE YEARS. FIVE YEARS. WE'VE BEEN GOING OUT FIVE YEARS, RIGHT? WE HAD THE FIVE-YEAR CONVERSATION THE OTHER DAY. SHE WAS LIKE, "I CAN'T KEEP INTRODUCING YOU AS MY BOYFRIEND. THAT'S SO CHILDISH. I COULD CALL YOU MY PARTNER, BUT THAT'S QUITE FORMAL. LOVER, SOULMATE." I WAS LIKE, "LANDLORD IS FINE." [ LAUGHTER ] "LANDLORD, WHAT, AND I'M YOUR TENANT?" "NO, TENANTS PAY RENT." [ LAUGHTER ] SQUATTER. I LOVE JOKING AS WELL WITH THE LANGUAGE BARRIER. THAT'S WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT BEING HERE. I WENT TO SPAIN RECENTLY. IT WAS A DISASTER. I WENT TO THIS RESTAURANT. I NEEDED TO GO TO THE RESTROOM. I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL, BUT I NEEDED TO DROP THE KIDS OFF AT THE POOL. ALL RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] SO I DID THAT. I GO TO FLUSH, IT DOESN'T WORK. I FLUSH AGAIN, STILL NOT WORKING. FIVE, SIX, SEVEN TIMES I TRY TO FLUSH THIS THING DOWN, IT WILL NOT GO. SO, I'M LIKE, "I'M GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING HERE. I'M NOT GOING TO DO A HIT AND RUN. I WILL GO OUT AND INFORM A A MEMBER OF STAFF THERE IS A A PROBLEM WITH THEIR FACILITIES." I GO INTO THE RESTAURANT, I FIND A WAITER. UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T SPEAK ANY SPANISH, HE DOESN'T SPEAK A A WORD OF ENGLISH. I END UP HAVING TO KIND OF GESTURE TO THIS MAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, "YES, CAN YOU JUST COME HERE? YES, LEAVE THEM ALONE, SIR. YES. JUST FOLLOW ME. SI, SI, POR FAVOR. JUST IN HERE. YEAH." I MANAGED TO USHER HIM INTO THE RESTROOM. I POINTED AT MY POO. I WENT TO FLUSH. IT WENT DOWN STRAIGHT AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW WEIRD DID I LOOK? LIKE I JUST INVITED A WAITER INTO THE RESTROOM TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO MY TURD! COME ON, LET'S GIVE IT A PROPER SENDOFF FLUSH. RULE BRITANNIA! BRITANNIA RULE THE WAY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT IS INSANE. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY UPTIGHT. VERY SENSITIVE. AS A CHILD, I WOULD NOT GO INTO SCHOOL IF I WAS NOT FEELING EMOTIONALLY STABLE ENOUGH TO DO SO. THE ARGUMENTS I HAD WITH MY POOR MOTHER. SHE'D BE LIKE, "JACK, YOU HAVE TO GO IN TO SCHOOL TODAY." I WAS LIKE, "MOTHER, I AM IN MOURNING. HAVE SOME DAMN RESPECT, WOMAN. DON'T YOU DARE GIVE ME ALL THIS, 'HE WAS JUST A LION.' MUSTAFA WAS A KING!" [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVED THAT FILM. "LION KING" IS MY FAVORITE FILM. I'M NOT ASHAMED TO SAY I'M A A GROWN MAN, THAT'S MY FAVORITE FILM. I'VE HAD FIGHTS WITH PEOPLE ABOUT "THE LION KING." I HAD A FIGHT THE OTHER DAY WITH THIS GIRL. SHE WAS AN ABSOLUTE IDIOT. ONE OF THESE HIPSTER TYPES, OKAY? YOU KNOW THE HIPSTERS? SHE HAD THAT HAIRCUT WHERE SHE JUST SHAVED HALF THE SIDE OF HER HEAD. WHAT IS THAT? YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE GONE TO JOIN THE MARINES AND THEN WIMPED OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS WAS HER QUOTE. GET READY FOR IT, BECAUSE IT IS A HUMDINGER OF A QUOTE. I WAS LIKE, "'THE LION KING' IS MY FAVORITE FILM." SHE WENT, "THAT CAN'T BE YOUR FAVORITE FILM. 'THE LION KING' IS A KID'S FILM." [ LAUGHTER ] KID'S FILM. YES, BOO INDEED. JUST A KID'S FILM, IS IT? JUST A KID'S FILM WITH A A CONSOLIDATED IMDB RATING OF 8.5. TWO ACADEMY AWARDS, TWO GOLDEN GLOBES THAT'S BEEN ADAPTED INTO THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BROADWAY MUSICAL OF ALL TIME, GENERATING A NET GROSS PROFIT OF $800 MILLION AND COUNTING. OH, BUT MAYBE IT'S JUST A KID'S FILM, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH ANY MATURE THEMES, SAID NOBODY EVER. "THE LION KING" IS THE GREATEST ANTHROPOMORPHIC ASSAULT UPON THE THEME OF MORTALITY THAT WESTERN CULTURE HAS EVER PRODUCED. IT IS SO COMPLEX THAT YOUR TINY SHRIVELED ANT SCROTUM OF A A BRAIN WOULDN'T DARE TO FATHOM IT. SO, NO, IT IS NOT JUST A KID'S FILM. IT IS SHAKESPEARE WITH FUR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YES. IS THE RESPONSE I THOUGHT OF THREE HOURS LATER. [ LAUGHTER ] GUYS, YOU'VE BEEN WONDERFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GOOD NIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: HEY, MAN. THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT, BROTHER. THAT'S A HOME RUN. JACK WHITEHALL! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CHECK OUT "MOTHER'S DAY" IN THEATERS NOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: THANK YOU, GUYS, SO MUCH. WHAT A FUN SHOW TONIGHT. THANK YOU TO PAUL RUDD, HUGH DANCY, JACK WHITEHALL, ONCE AGAIN! AND THE ROOTS, RIGHT THERE, FROM PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STAY TUNED FOR "LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS." THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING. HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND. I HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. BYE, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
