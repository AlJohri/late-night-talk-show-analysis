YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. THIS IS IT. YOU'RE AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT NIGHT. WE'LL HAVE FUN. HERE'S WHAT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT, HERE. SOME BAD NEWS FOR DONALD TRUMP. I READ THAT THE CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS HE'S MADE SINCE HE BEGAN HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HAVE COST HIS BRAND AS MUCH AS $80 MILLION. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ CHEERS ] YOU CAN TELL THINGS ARE ROUGH FOR TRUMP. TODAY HE HAD TO WIPE HIS MOUTH WITH A NAPKIN INSTEAD OF A 20. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE WAS LIKE -- [ TRUMP IMPRESSION ] "THIS IS HUMILIATING." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, TRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS HAVE COST HIS BRAND AS MUCH AS $80 MILLION. SO IN OTHER WORDS, DONALD TRUMP HAS GONE FROM THIS --
Jimmy: TO THIS.
WE NEED MONEY. WE'RE DYING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE'RE DYING! WE ARE DYING! [ APPLAUSE ] THE OTHER BIG POLITICAL NEWS THIS WEEK IS THAT WISCONSIN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER BECAME THE 15th REPUBLICAN TO ANNOUNCE HIS CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT. OF COURSE, LIKE ALL CANDIDATES HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THE BUDGET AND IMMIGRATION. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT HE ALWAYS SEEMS TO TALK ABOUT.
I WENT TO KOHL'S DEPARTMENT STORES NEAR OUR HOUSE AND I BOUGHT SOMETHING AT THE PRICE IT WAS MARKED AT. SO NOW I KNOW OVER THE YEARS IF I'M GOING TO BUY A SHIRT IT'S $29.99 I GO TO THE RACK THAT SAYS, "NOW $19.99." I REMEMBER TO GET THE FLYER OUT THAT WE GOT MAILED TO OUR HOUSE WHERE IF YOU GET 15%, 20%, OR IF YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY 30% OFF. TONETTE USUALLY IS WITH ME. AND SHE'LL REACH INTO HER PURSE AND PULL OUT HER KOHL'S CASH. AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THEY'RE PAYING ME TO BUY THE SHIRT! [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE MUST BE FUN TO SIT NEXT TO ON A LONG FLIGHT. $19.99, THIS RACK SAYS $29. PULL OUT MY KOHL'S BUCKS. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE HE CAN GO TO KOHL'S, BUY SOME NEW MATERIAL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY-OH. OF COURSE, YESTERDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE A STATEMENT ON HIS HISTORIC IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. JOE BIDEN JOINED HIM BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING THROUGHOUT THE SPEECH. WHICH IS GOOD FOR JOE.

TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT MARKS ONE MORE CHAPTER IN THE PURSUIT OF A SAFER AND MORE HELPFUL, MORE HOPEFUL WORLD. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [ WHISPERING ]

I KNOW. IT'S WONDERFUL, ISN'T IT?
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU ON. YOU'RE THE BEST! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS SHOW EVER SINCE I FIRST CAME TO AMERICA IN 1967. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE THING, MUST BE IN TO WATCH "THE TONIGHT SHOW." AND ONE DAY, I GOT TO BE ON IT WITH JOHNNY CARSON.
Jimmy: YOU GOT TO MEET HIM?
IN 1986. GEORGE CARLIN WAS THE FIRST GUEST.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I WAS THE LAST GUEST. AND THEN, THERE WAS ANOTHER GUEST IN BETWEEN CALLED FLAT NOSE. WONDERFUL ACT. AND I WAS FRONT OF HOUSE WATCHING BECAUSE I INTRIGUED HOW THE WHOLE SHOW WAS PUT TOGETHER. AND FLAT NOSE CAME ON AND DID HIS ACT, AND JOHNNY WAS SO TAKEN WITH IT THAT HE GOT THE ACT TO BE REPEATED TWO OR THREE OR FOUR TIMES. AND IN THE END I WAS BUMPED, I WASN'T ALLOWED TO BE ON THE SHOW AT ALL. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] SO IT'S -- I KNOW. SO IT'S VERY NICE TO COME BACK AND DO THE SHOW WITH YOU.
Jimmy: YOU WERE NEVER ON THE SHOW?
NO. AND -- DO YOU KNOW WHO FLAT NOSE WAS? I THINK YOUR TEAM KNOW WHO HE WAS.
Jimmy: WE ACTUALLY GOT A A CLIP OF HIM. THIS IS THE EPISODE OF "THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JOHNNY CARSON" THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON.
THE REAL SHOW, YEAH.

THERE'S ON TO ME. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR FILM "MR. HOLMES."
OH, PLEASE, YES. WONDERFUL.
Jimmy: FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE "SHERLOCK HOLMES", AND SO ANYTHING "SHERLOCK HOLMES," I LOVE TO WATCH. BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT TAKE ON "SHERLOCK HOLMES."
YEAH. DO YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN OVER A HUNDRED ACTORS HAVE PLAYED "SHERLOCK HOLMES" IN VARIOUS VERSIONS ON STAGE, ON TV, ON FILM. BUT THIS ONE IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER, BECAUSE HE'S 93 YEARS OLD, HE'S RETIRED, AND HE'S LOOKING BACK AT THE PAST AND TRYING TO REMEMBER THE LAST CASE THAT HE DIDN'T REALLY SOLVE. IT SENT HIM INTO RETIREMENT. HE'S BEEN LIVING WITH HIS BEES DOWN BY THE SEA, AND HASN'T DONE A JOB FOR 30 YEARS. BUT NOW, IN THIS MOVIE, HE GETS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM, AND THE PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY HIS OWN HEART. AND IT'S REVEALED THAT SHERLOCK ISN'T JUST ALL BRAIN. HE'S GOT A HEART LIKE ALL OF US. SO, IT'S A SWEET STORY WITH A A HAPPY ENDING.
Jimmy: IT'S BEAUTIFUL -- AND, GOSH, IT IS BEAUTIFULLY SHOT. I WAS TELLING YOU BACKSTAGE, BILL CONDON IS THE DIRECTOR?
THAT'S RIGHT, THE DIRECTOR, YES.
Jimmy: WHO DO UH -- WHAT DID HE DO?
"DREAM GIRLS."
Jimmy: AND "GODS AND MONSTERS."
"GODS AND MONSTERS" WITH ME.
Jimmy: HE'S DOING THE NEW "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST."
"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST," WHICH I'M IN.
Jimmy: OH, YOU'RE IN THAT AS WELL?
YES, I PLAY A CLOCK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DOING BUSINESS. ABSOLUTELY.
TICK TOCK. "LORD OF THE RINGS." "LORD OF THE RINGS."
Jimmy: THANK YOU. I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THE REFERENCE, BUT I'M GLAD YOU DID. THANK YOU, YEAH. BUT I'VE GOT TO SAY, HE SHOT THIS THING SO FANTASTIC. AND IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL. OH MY -- WHERE DID YOU FILM THIS?
WELL, IT WAS DOWN ON THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND. AND IT WAS IN A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE, WHICH YOU CAN HIRE. YOU CAN GO -- BED AND BREAKFAST. IT'S THE FAMILY HOME OF THE PENN FAMILY, WHO -- WILLIAM PENN OF PENNSYLVANIA. SO, IT SHOULD BE ON EVERY AMERICAN'S ROUTE.
Jimmy: IT IS BEAUTIFUL. WHEN YOU SEE THIS FILM, YOU'RE JUST GONNA FALL IN LOVE WITH. THERE'S LIKE A TRAIN GOING THROUGH AT THE BEGINNING WITH A A PUFF OF SMOKE COMING OUT. IT LOOKS SO LIKE A STORYBOOK. YOU'RE LIKE, "I WANNA MOVE THERE, OH MY GOSH." BUT IT'S A FANTASTIC FILM. YOU GUYS ARE GONNA WANNA CHECK THIS OUT, HERE'S A CLIP. HERE'S IAN McKELLEN IN "MR. HOLMES." PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WHAT POSSIBLE MOTIVE COULD THAT GERMAN WOMAN HAVE HAD TO KILL ANNE? THAT NIGHT, I SEARCHED FOR SOMETHING TO JOG MY MEMORY OF THE ACTUAL CASE. AND THERE IT WAS. A PICTURE. YOU KNOW, A FEW YEARS AGO, I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WOMAN IN THAT PHOTOGRAPH. CERTAINLY, I'D RECALL WHAT HAD BECAME OF HER, WHETHER SHE WAS VICTIM OR CULPRIT. BUT THAT NIGHT -- I'M CONFUSING MY BRAIN, DAMNIT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
