Jimmy: YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE THIS CHEESE.
I GUESS I'LL FINISH IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T STOP EATING. AND I'VE PUT ON SOME WEIGHT. BUT, LUCKILY, THIS IS INTENTIONAL. I DON'T WANT TO BRAG OR ANYTHING, BUT I'M PREPARING FOR KIND OF A BIG ROLE. IT'S A CINNAMON ROLL. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE I CAN'T FINISH IT.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. YOU HAVE TO DO IT IF YOU STARTED. ABSOLUTELY. HOW'S THE FAMILY? YOU'RE DOING GOOD. JEANNIE'S YOUR WIFE, AND YOU HAVE FIVE KIDS.
WE HAVE FIVE KIDS. WE USED TO HAVE MORE, BUT I ATE THEM.
Jimmy: NO, JIM, THAT'S NOT -- JIM, YOU DIDN'T EVERYTHING. YOU DID NOT.
WE HAVE FIVE -- WELL, I HAVEN'T TALKED TO MY WIFE IN AN HOUR, SO WE COULD HAVE MORE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, THE WEIRD THING IS, ABOUT WHEN YOU HAVE FIVE KIDS -- STRANGERS THINK YOU'RE UNAWARE THAT IT'S A LOT OF CHILDREN. [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AND GO, "YOU HAVE FIVE KIDS? THAT'S A LOT OF KIDS." I'M LIKE, "OH, YOU THINK SO?" [ LAUGHTER ] THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP. DO YOU MIND IF I STAB YOU IN THE HEAD?
Jimmy: NO, NO. COME ON NOW.
THE BEST IS WHEN I'M ALONE WITH MY FIVE KIDS. INEVITABLY STRUGGLING. THERE'S ALWAYS A STRANGER THAT WILL COME UP TO ME AND GO, "LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT YOUR HANDS FULL." YOU KNOW, THAT'S LIKE GOING UP TO SOMEONE IN A WHEELCHAIR -- "LOOKS LIKE YOU DON'T DO A LOT OF DANCING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT I LOVE IT! YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A DAD. BABIES ARE AMAZING, RIGHT?
Jimmy: IT'S BEST THING IN THE WHOLE -- BABIES ARE AMAZING. I LOVE IT, YEAH.
SOUNDS LIKE A CLICHE. BUT YOU HAVE A CHILD, AND YOU PUT UP WITH THE SCREAMING AND THE SMELLS AND THE ABSENCE OF SLEEP. I WAS OUT OF TOWN TWO WEEKS AGO. I DROVE BY A SKUNK. ALL I COULD THINK WAS "I MISS BY BABY." [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE BABIES ARE MAGIC, RIGHT?
Jimmy: THEY ARE MAGIC.
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE WORST ROOMMATES. LIKE IF YOU HAD A ROOMMATE THAT DID ONE OF THE THINGS A NEWBORN DOES, YOU WOULD BE LIKE -- YOU'RE MOVING OUT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN'T EVEN REASON WITH A A BABY. YOU CAN'T BE LIKE, WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON LAST NIGHT? YOU WERE HITTING THE BOTTLE PRETTY HARD. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN YOU STARTED SCREAMING, AND YOU THREW UP ON ME. THEN, YOU PASSED OUT AND WET YOURSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] I WENT IN THE OTHER ROOM TO GET YOU SOME DRY CLOTHES. I COME BACK. YOU'RE ALL OVER MY WIFE'S BREASTS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GOT TO MOVE OUT.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS. [ APPLAUSE ]
IT'S ALWAYS FUN WHEN THE MOTHER BREAST FEEDS, RIGHT? BECAUSE THE BABY ALWAYS LOOKS RIGHT AT THE DAD, LIKE "WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT ABOUT IT?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE HAD A BROOKLYN ACCENT AND EVERYTHING. YEAH. DO YOU TAKE THEM ON THE ROAD WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO ON TOUR?
TWICE A YEAR WE DO TOURS WHERE WE'LL BE ON A TOUR BUS WITH ALL THE KIDS AND WE'LL KIND OF GO TO A DESTINATION. LIKE, WE WENT TO THE SOUTH. LAST SPRING BREAK WE WENT TO MOUNT RUSHMORE.
Jimmy: OH AMAZING.
THAT'S THE MOST APPLAUSE MOUNT RUSHMORE'S EVER GOT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I NEVER WENT. I'D LOVE TO GO TO MOUNT RUSHMORE.
I FEEL SORRY FOR MOUNT RUSHMORE. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE USED TO GO THERE ON THEIR HONEYMOON. AND NOW I BRING UP MOUNT RUSHMORE, AND PEOPLE LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M TALKING ABOUT A A TV SHOW THAT WAS CANCELED 20 YEARS AGO. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT STILL GOING ON? IT'S A MOUNTAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S STILL GOING ON.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S BEAUTIFUL. AND YOU KNOW, IT'S THE BLACK HILLS OF SOUTH DAKOTA. THEY'RE AMAZING. AND THEY'RE SACRED TO THE LAKOTA INDIANS. AND OUT OF RESPECT, OUR GOVERNMENT CARVED FOUR WHITE GUYS IN ONE OF THE MOUNTAINS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ] THIS LAND IS SACRED. HOW ABOUT THAT MOUNTAIN? VERY SACRED. ALL RIGHT, WE GOT AN IDEA. DING DING, DING! HERE'S ANOTHER GIFT FOR YOU GUYS.
Jimmy: GIFTS KEEP ON COMING IN. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. BUT DO YOU GET ANY TIME FOR YOURSELF? DO YOU AND THE WIFE GET TO GO OUT OR --
YOU KNOW, WE TRY THE DO DATE NIGHT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE FACTORED THAT IN. WE USUALLY GO OUT TO DINNER, AND I ALWAYS GET A STEAK BECAUSE I'M A MAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S ONLY MANLY THING I DO.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S THE ONLY --
I WISH -- YOU KNOW, ALL THE SUPPOSED MANLY ATTRIBUTES, I DON'T HAVE. LIKE, I'M NOT HANDY. I CAN'T FIX THINGS. IF SOMETHING BREAKS IN OUR APARTMENT, I JUST LOOK AT MY WIFE. I'M LIKE, "WE SHOULD CALL SOMEONE." [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T EVEN CALL. MY WIFE CALLS. I'M LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK A PHONE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOT MANLY AT ALL. WAS YOUR DAD MANLY? YOU HAD BROTHERS.
MY DAD AND MY BROTHERS WERE VERY MANLY. THEY LOVED CARS. YOU KNOW, CARS ARE MANLY. OF COURSE, THE MOST MANLY CAR IS THE PICKUP. YOU GOT A PICKUP, RIGHT?
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S A MAN'S THING.
MY BROTHER MIKE'S GOT A A PICKUP BECAUSE HE'S A MAN.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT! HOW BIG IS YOUR TRUCK? BIG ENOUGH! [ LAUGHTER ]
THOSE PICKUP COMMERCIALS JUST GIVE ME ANXIETY AT THIS POINT. THEY'RE LIKE, "YOU CAN TOW ONE TON. YOU CAN TOW TWO TONS. YOU CAN TOW AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER."
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I'M LIKE, WHY? [ LAUGHTER ] I ONLY NEED SEE YOU GOING TO CRACKER BARREL. WHAT DO YOU NEED A PICKUP FOR? NO ONE WITH PICKUP TRUCKS IS PICKING ANYTHING UP.
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW. BUT I WILL. I'LL PICK STUFF UP.
IT'S LIKE WALKING AROUND WITH A HUGE EMPTY SUITCASE. [ LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU GOING ON A TRIP? NO, BUT I'M THE TYPE OF GUY WHO WOULD. [ LAUGHTER ] IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. SO YOU GO OUT AND YOU ENJOY A A NICE STEAK?
I GET A STEAK. BUT I LOVE STEAK. I EAT STAKE AT HOME. I ORDER STAKE FROM OMAHA STEAKS. DO YOU DO THAT? DO YOU ORDER YOUR MEAT OVER THE INTERNET?
Jimmy: NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S LIKE A SIGN OF A A PROBLEM, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU ORDER STEAKS OVER THE INTERNET.
YEAH, IT'S LIKE AMAZON.COM OF BEEF. [ LAUGHTER ] I ORDER IT, AND THEN THIS STYROFOAM COOLER SHOWS UP. THE SAME KIND OF COOLER THEY ARE GOING TO DELIVER MY REPLACEMENT HEART IN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS. I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS. JIM GAFFIGAN! "OBSESSED" AIRS SUNDAY AT 10:00 P.M. THIS SUNDAY, 10:00 P.M. ON COMEDY CENTRAL. I PRE-ORDERED THIS GUY. FUTURE AND PUSHA T PERFORM NEXT. COME ON BACK, EVERYBODY.
Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST JUST RELEASED HIS HIGHLY ANTICIPATED SECOND ALBUM. OH NO, THIS ISN'T IT RIGHT HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S CALLED "HONEST." IT CAME OUT YESTERDAY. HE'S HERE TONIGHT TO PERFORM HIS HIT SINGLE "MOVE THAT DOH" WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM PUSHA T AND THE ROOTS. PLEASE WELCOME FUTURE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
