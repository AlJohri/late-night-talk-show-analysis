MUSICAL GUEST, THE AVETT BROTHERS. AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW. AND NOW, HERE'S YOUR HOST JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HEY, EVERYBODY. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. HERE WE ARE. THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. YESTERDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA UNVEILED HIS BUDGET FOR 2015. AND NO BIG SURPRISE, REPUBLICANS IMMEDIATELY CAME OUT AND STARTED CRITICIZING IT. HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER EVEN SAID IT'S OBAMA'S MOST IRRESPONSIBLE BUDGET YET. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN BOEHNER SAID, "AND IF YOU THINK THAT'S HARSH, WAIT TILL I ACTUALLY READ IT! THEN I'M REALLY GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT'S ON MY MIND." [ APPLAUSE ] I'M THINKING OF SOMETHING TO SAY. OBAMA'S DEFENDING THE BUDGET, THOUGH, WHICH HE'S REFERRING TO AS A ROAD MAP FOR CREATING JOBS. THEN YOUNG PEOPLE SAID, "A WHAT FOR CREATING WHAT? ROAD MAP? JOB? I'VE NEVER HEARD OF EITHER OF THOSE THINGS." [ LAUGHTER ] SIRI, GET ME A JOB. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. FORGET IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THIS IS THE THING IN OBAMA'S NEW BUDGET, IT ACTUALLY INCLUDES A PROPOSAL TO PHASE OUT PENNIES AND NICKELS TO MAKE THE GOVERNMENT MORE EFFICIENT. AND TO MAKE GRANDPARENTS BETTER TIPPERS. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU, YOUNG MAN. HERE'S SIX CENTS. SIX CENTS? I SEE DEAD PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T LIKE THAT JOKE. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST TRYING TO BE FUNNY. LOOSEN THINGS UP, YOU OLD BAG. GIVE ME THAT SIX CENTS. HERE'S SEVEN CENTS. SOME MORE NEWS OUT OF D.C. I SAW THE CITY COUNCIL JUST APPROVED A MEASURE TO DECRIMINALIZE POSSESSION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIJUANA. [ CHEERS ] AT LEAST NOW CONGRESS WILL BE PASSING SOMETHING. THAT'S A GOOD THING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS! [ LAUGHTER ] I HAD TO I HAD TO DO IT. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK. I HATE THAT JOKE.
Steve: GRANDMA SANDLER.
Jimmy: GRANDMA SANDLER. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. THAT'S RIGHT, WASHINGTON, D.C. IS LOOSENING ITS MARIJUANA LAWS, AND IT KIND OF SEEMS TO ME LIKE CERTAIN POLITICIANS MIGHT EVEN BE PARTAKING. I MEAN, JUST TAKE A LOOK AT JOHN BOEHNER'S RECENT SPEECH. NOW, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNDOCTORED, COMPLETELY UNEDITED, JUST STRAIGHT OUT OF THE CAMERA. HERE IS AN UNALTERED CLIP.
THEY CAN'T PASS UNLESS THERE'S BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALTERED. I TAKE THAT BACK. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALTERED A A LITTLE BIT.
Steve: JUST A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: I'M JUST AS UPSET AS YOU GUYS ARE. OF COURSE, THE BIG INTERNATIONAL STORY CONTINUES TO BE THE CONFLICT IN THE UKRAINE. RUSSIA IS THREATENING TO INVADE, AND THE U.S. IS STEPPING IN. IN FACT, JUST YESTERDAY THE U.S. GAVE $1 BILLION TO THE UKRAINE TO HELP STABILIZE THE REGION. $1 BILLION. THEN DETROIT WAS, LIKE, HEY, CAN WE GO TO WAR WITH RUSSIA? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DO WE GOTTA DO TO GET THAT? I WANT TO WET ME BEAK A LITTLE BIT ON THAT. HERE'S SEVEN CENTS. GET OUT OF HERE LADY. I HAVE A STACK OF THEM ALL AROUND MY HOUSE. I GIVE THEM TO EVERYBODY. HERE'S A SHINY ONE. SHINY NOT FOR YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] GET THIS. JUST ONE DAY AFTER THE U.S. GAVE THEM A BILLION DOLLARS, THE E.U. ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS GIVING THE UKRAINE $15 BILLION. IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN YOUR SISTER GIVES YOUR MOM A FANCY NECKLACE FOR CHRISTMAS RIGHT AFTER YOU GAVE HER A PAIR OF SOCKS. HEY, I THOUGHT WE HAD A A $20 LIMIT HERE. TRUE STORY, ONE CHRISTMAS MY SISTER GAVE MY MOM A BOOK ABOUT MENOPAUSE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: I BET THAT WAS A FUN CHRISTMAS.
Jimmy: SHE WENT AND CRIED. YEAH. DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? REPUBLICAN SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID YESTERDAY THAT RUSSIA'S TENSIONS WITH THE UKRAINE ARE THE RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI. THEN JOHN TRAVOLTA SAID, "ACTUALLY, IT'S PRONOUNCED IDINA MENZEL. I MADE THE SAME MISTAKE. A SIMPLE MISTAKE." [ APPLAUSE ] GUYS, IF YOU'RE IN A A RELATIONSHIP, YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS. THERE'S A NEW iPHONE APP DESIGNED FOR BUSY GUYS CALLED BRO APP THAT SENDS THOUGHTFUL, PREWRITTEN TEXTS TO THEIR GIRLFRIENDS. PRETTY INTERESTING CONCEPT, BUT WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO HEAR SOME OF THESE THOUGHTFUL TEXTS READ OUT LOUD. AND THERE'S NO BETTER PERSON TO DO THAT THAN ONE OF OUR GUESTS TONIGHT, STAR OF "THE WALKING DEAD," NORMAN REEDUS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NORMAN, READ THESE VERY, VERY NICE RELATIONSHIP TEXTS WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, PLEASE.
YOU'D BETTER BE READY FOR AN ATTACK FROM THE SMOOCH MONSTER TONIGHT.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, I JUST READ THIS TODAY ON THE INTERNET. IT'S NOT GOOD. NEW YORK CITY'S MOST EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT IS GETTING SOME NEGATIVE ATTENTION AFTER IT GOT A "C" GRADE FROM HEALTH INSPECTORS DUE TO MULTIPLE SANITARY VIOLATIONS. IT'S STILL A PRETTY FANCY PLACE, THOUGH. IN ORDER TO POOP ON THE FLOOR, RATS HAVE TO MAKE RESERVATIONS MONTHS IN ADVANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] OPEN TABLE. THIS MADE ME LAUGH. A NEW SURVEY FOUND THAT 11% OF ADULTS THOUGHT THE COMPUTER LANGUAGE HTML WAS THE NAME OF AN STD. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS IRONIC, BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT HTML, YOU PROBABLY NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING AN STD. [ LAUGHTER ] GEEK SQUAD HERE. WHAT? WHAT AM I WEARING? I'M WEARING A BLACK GOLF SHIRT AND REQUIRED KHAKIS AND VELCRO SNEAKERS.
Steve: ALLOW ME TO PAY FOR THAT DATE.
Jimmy: OH, NICE VELCRO WALLET. [ LAUGHTER ] ALLOW ME TO PAY FOR THAT, MY FRIEND. YOU LIKE TRANSFORMERS? MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: I LOVE THOSE THINGS, MAN. CHECK THIS -- OH, THIS IS AWESOME NEWS. OSCAR MAYER IS COMING OUT WITH A NEW VERSION OF LUNCHABLES THAT'S FOR ADULTS. [ CHEERS ] WHEN I HEARD THAT, I WAS, LIKE, GOOD, BECAUSE I DEFINITELY WASN'T EATING LUNCHABLES BEFORE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE COMING OUT WITH A MORE GROWN-UP VERSION OF LUNCHABLES. THEY'RE CALLED, SO YOU STILL CAN'T COOKABLES. [ LAUGHTER ] GROWUPABLES ARE READY. DON'T WORRY, YOU LIVE ALONABLES. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY LONG TITLE. THEY SAY IT'S A GREAT WAY TO EAT LUNCH ON THE GO OR LET PEOPLE KNOW YOU'RE RECENTLY DIVORCED. THIS IS INTERESTING, HERE A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT EXPERIENCING DEPRESSION CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU LIVE LONGER. TURNS OUT EVEN DISEASES DON'T WANT TO HANG OUT WITH YOU. IT'S VERY JUST ALL-AROUND SAD STORY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'D RATHER GO INFECT SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU'RE BORING.
Steve: YOU'RE EATING LUNCHABLES.
Jimmy: YEAH. I HAVE TO EAT LUNCHABLES, I'M ON THE GEEK SQUAD ALL DAY LONG. WELL WE'VE HAD OUR NEW POPE, POPE FRANCIS, FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW. AND HE JUST KEEPS GETTING MORE AND MORE POPULAR. IN FACT, I JUST SAW THERE'S A A NEW MAGAZINE THAT WILL FOCUS ON POPE FRANCIS. TOTALLY TRUE. WE ACTUALLY GOT OUR HANDS ON THE FIRST ISSUE.
Steve: DID YOU REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH, THEY GAVE IT TO US FIRST.

LIKE -- AND HER HEAD POPS UP. SHE GOES "THE SUN IS COMING UP, LIKE A BIG, BALD HEAD." AND IT JUST STUCK WITH ME. SO I WENT WITH BIG, BALD HEAD.
Jimmy: WOW, SEE? THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES TO YOU, I LOVE THAT.
YEAH, IT'S COOL. AGAIN, MORE THINGS TO BE EXCITED ABOUT. I SAW THIS PICTURE, AND IT'S FROM @BIGBALDHEAD. YOU'RE SO PSYCHED THE MEET FRED ARMISEN AND KYLE MacLACHLAN. IT'S A VERY BLURRY PICTURE, BUT I LOVE THAT YOU WE'RE EXCITED TO MEET THESE GUYS. YOU'RE A BIG FAN OF FRED ARMISEN?
OH, MAN, I LOVE HIM.
Jimmy: HAVE YOU MET HIM BEFORE?
YOU KNOW, I MET HIM AT THE "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" AFTER-PARTY WHEN THEY DID A A SKETCH OF "WALKING DEAD."
Jimmy: YEAH. I REMEMBER THAT, YEAH. BILL HADER WAS -- WAS HE YOU?
HE PLAYED ME, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH WAS AWESOME. HE WAS LIKE -- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? BUT HE TEXTED ME AND SAID, "CAN YOU COME TO THE PARTY AFTERWARDS? HOW'D I DO?" I WAS LIKE "OH, MY GOD. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE'." I WENT TO THE PARTY AND I SAW FRED. I THINK I HUGGED FRED, LIKE, 12 TIMES.
Jimmy: WHY? DID YOU JUST KEEP HUGGING HIM?
I'M A HUGGER. I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Jimmy: YOU JUST KEPT HUGGING HIM. THAT'S REALLY FUN, YEAH.
AT ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE, HE WAS KIND OF LIKE, AGAIN?
Jimmy: HE SAID AGAIN? YOU'RE GOING TO HUG AGAIN?
IT WAS IN HIS FACE.
Jimmy: YOU BROUGHT US A FUN THING, HERE. THIS IS JUST AMAZING THAT YOU CAN SAY THAT YOU HAVE THIS. IT'S AN ACTION FIGURE OF YOURSELF.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S PRETTY COOL. [ APPLAUSE ] WHAT'S IT LIKE GETTING AN ACTION FIGURE? DO THEY JUST WATCH THE SHOW AND THEN JUST MAKE THESE THINGS UP? DO YOU HAVE TO POSE FOR THIS?
WELL, THEY KEEP MAKING IT WITH NO SLEEVES, SO I'M CONSTANTLY DOING -- TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE LITTLE TOY.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. YOU HAVE TO DO, LIKE, 40 PUSH-UPS BEFORE THEY DO IT.
THAT'S WHAT I DID.
Jimmy: WHEN I WAS LIKE, TOO, AND MY ARMS WERE JUST LIKE THAT. SAME THING. I DON'T WANT TO PROVE IT TO YOU NOW. IT WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.
THEY DO A SCAN OF YOUR FACE. AND THEY KEPT -- THEY HAVE A A LITTLE WAND THAT THEY DO, AND THEY KEPT SCANNING MY FACE. IT WOULD JUST BE BLACK RIGHT HERE. AND THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT -- THEY THOUGHT IT WAS BROKEN OR SOMETHING. I SAID "WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A TITANIUM EYE SOCKET." I WAS IN A CAR CRASH AND I HAVE A METAL EYE SOCKET. THEY WERE LIKE, "OH, THAT MAKES SENSE."
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A TITANIUM EYE SOCKET.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S WILD.
I WAS IN BERLIN AT THE BERLIN FILM FESTIVAL. A MUTUAL FRIEND OF OURS, THEIR BAND PLAYED. ON THE WAY HOME, I GOT HIT BY AN 18-WHEELER. I ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL, HAVING SURGERY.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. SO THEY PUT IN A TITANIUM?
YEAH.
Jimmy: CAN YOU, LIKE, SHOOT LASERS OR ANYTHING? [ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE. DURR.
Jimmy: YEAH, DURR, DUH. YOU SHOULD. [ LASER SOUND ] HEY! HOW COOL IS THAT?
NOT BAD.
Jimmy: HE CAN SHOOT LASERS OUT OF HIS EYE! WE HAVE A CLIP I WANT TO SHOW. HERE'S NORMAN REEDUS IN "WALKING DEAD," RIGHT THERE, EVERYBODY.
WHAT ARE WE TRACKING?

YEAH. KEEP ON TRACKING.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE BIGGEST SHOW IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

Jimmy: AND IT'S A BIGGER SHOW. BIGGER THAN "BIG BANG THEORY," BIGGER THAN ANY SHOW.
