Jimmy: DO YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE?
YOU BETTER SHAVE THE AFRO THOUGH SOON. 'CAUSE WHEN IT STARTS GETTING GRAY, YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK LIKE CORNEL WEST. [ LAUGHTER ]
Questlove: CORNEL QUEST.
Jimmy: CORNEL QUEST. THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, WE TALKED ABOUT THE ROOTS. YOU SAID THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THEM, IT'S LIKE EVERY DIFFERENT STYLE HAIRCUT YOU CAN HAVE AT THE BARBER. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU GO TO A BARBERSHOP, IT'S EVERY DIFFERENT STYLE HAIRCUT YOU CAN HAVE.
I TALK ABOUT SO MANY PEOPLE, I FORGOT WHAT I SAID. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL WE TALK ABOUT --
IT'S JUST A DAMN SHAME AT THIS POINT.
Jimmy: WE THOUGHT IT'D BE FUN TO MAKE YOU A NICE SIGN, SO WE GOT YOU A "TONIGHT SHOW" HAIRSTYLES. THIS IS EVERY -- YOU CAN HANG THIS UP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE THE HIGGINS, THE KIRK, THE QUESTLOVE, AND THE JAMES RIGHT THERE. THAT'S FOR YOU. YOU CAN TAKE THAT. I THINK THAT'S FOR YOU. THAT'S FOR YOU.
YOU GO TO THE BARBERSHOP, POINT TO WHAT YOU WANT ON THE WALL. I'LL TAKE THE QUESTLOVE, PLEASE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'LL TAKE THE MARCUS. THAT'S HILARIOUS.
Jimmy: WELCOME. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMING BACK. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
I LOVE BEING HERE. IT'S JUST TOO COLD IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: IT'S FREEZING HERE.
OH, IT IS BLACK WINTER. THIS IS THE WEATHER -- [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE WEATHER WHERE BROTHERS STOP COMING OUTSIDE. WE START GETTING ASHY IN WEIRD PLACES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LOOK AT THE BROTHER NEXT TO YOU. I GOT ALL THE ROOTS RIGHT NOW, THIS RIGHT HERE GETS REAL ASHY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT PART OF THE HAND THIS IS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT LOOKS LIKE SPIDER-MAN HIT YOU WITH A LITTLE WEB. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S COLD, COLD. BECAUSE GIRLS IN NEW YORK, IN THE SUMMER TIME, THEY'RE ALL CUTE. OUT HERE, YOU GET THE COLD, THEY ALL GO THIS FACE -- "OH, DAMN, IT'S COLD OUT HERE!" [ LAUGHTER ] GIRLS STOP SHAVING. WOMEN LIKE TO BE PRISTINE. THEY'RE LIKE, UH-UH, THAT'S INSULATION. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT TRUE. NO WAY.
NO, IT'S TRUE. I'M DEAD SERIOUS.
Jimmy: IT'S COLD.
AND THAT'S EVERYWHERE. IT'S LIKE ALL THE WAXING STOPS. YOU KNOW, NORMALLY I GOT THE LITTLE CHAPLAIN THING OR THE LITTLE AIR STRIP. NO, WHEN IT GET COLD, EVERYBODY GROWS THE QUESTLOVE DOWN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GIVE ME BACK THAT SIGN. HAIRSTYLES. FOR UP HERE. HEY -- [ LAUGHTER ]
I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE HERE IN THE WINTER THAN THE SUMMER, BECAUSE SUMMER IN NEW YORK, YEAH, I CAN'T TAKE THE HUMIDITY MAN. IT JUST FEELS LIKE THERE'S JUST A FAT PERSON ON YOUR BACK -- [ LAUGHTER ] JUST BREATHING ON YOU AND SAYING ALL H WORDS. "HEY HAROLD. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW'S HEATHER, HUH?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HOW'S HEATHER? WELL, I GOTTA SAY, LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, YOU SHOWED US JUST A POSTER.
YES.
Jimmy: OF YOUR FILM "FIFTY SHADES OF BLACK."
YES.
Jimmy: JANUARY 29th IT COMES OUT. THE POSTER GOT A LAUGH. JUST LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE POSTER. THAT'S THE MOVIE POSTER. YOU'RE JUST CRAZY. I JUST LOVE YOU. DO I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE BOOK OR THE MOVIE "FIFTY SHADES OF GREY" IS?
NO, IT'S JUST A FUNNY MOVIE. IT'S JUST A RETELLING OF THE STORY. IT'S JUST A COMEDY. WE TOOK THEIR CHARACTERS AND WE JUST DID THE SPIN ON IT. IT'S LIKE THE URBAN SPIN. SO YOU KNOW, WITH A BLACK GIRL, YOU AIN'T GOING -- ALL THE BEATINGS THAT LITTLE DAKOTA TOOK IN THAT MOVIE, YOU AIN'T GOING TO DO THAT TO A SISTER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GOT TWO OR THREE HITS AND SHE'S LIKE, "OH, HELL NO. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS. WE AIN'T GOING TO DO THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T MAKE ME CALL MY BROTHERS IN JAIL. NO THIS IS NOT '12 YEARS A A SLAVE'! I AIN'T TRYING TO HEAR THIS!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE MR. BLACK.
I'M MR. BLACK.
Jimmy: YEAH AND THE FUN -- THE WEIRD TWIST IN THIS IS THAT YOU'RE NOT A GREAT LOVER IN THIS ONE.
NO HE'S -- HE'S A REALLY BAD LOVER. LIKE, IN THE MOVIE, HE'S NOT A A GREAT LOVER. LIKE, HE DIDN'T HAVE NO MOVES. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? IT'S NOT A RACIAL THING. I DON'T WANT YOU TO TAKE OFFENSE, BECAUSE YOU'RE MY FRIEND, AND I GOT WHITE FRIENDS. I THINK YOU NEED THEM, ESPECIALLY FOR WHEN THE COPS PULL YOU OVER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN THE COPS PULL YOU OVER, PLEASE LET YOUR WHITE FRIEND DO THE TALKING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHY I'M HERE, BUDDY.
YEAH, BUT WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN THE BED. LIKE, WE MOVE DIFFERENTLY. LIKE WHITE GUYS, IT'S LIKE THIS AND THIS MOVE ALL TOGETHER. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S JUST ALL THIS. LIKE A STRESS BALL OR SOMETHING. ALL THIS. AND BROTHERS, WE DO IT DIFFERENT. WHEN WE MOVE, IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, ALL THAT JUST MOVES. THAT JUST MOVES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
