Jimmy: AND SHE'S SO FUN. BUT THE MOVIE IS SO INTERESTING. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.
WELL, RELATIVE TO ACHIEVEMENT, I DIDN'T KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS I TOOK THE JOB IS I READ THE SCRIPT AND I'M INTRIGUED BY THIS CHARACTER. HE'S DIFFICULT, HE'S FUNNY, HE'S INCREDIBLY SMART. AND THERE ARE ODD ANGLES TO HIM, YOU KNOW HE'S NOT --
Jimmy: REALLY, I MEAN, INCREDIBLY, BEYOND SMART.
YEAH, HE'S THE FATHER OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND COMPUTING. HE'S THE MAN WHO SPEARHEADED THE --
Jimmy: COMPUTERS. WAIT, WHAT?
EXACTLY. THEN ON TOP OF THAT, HE'S SOMEBODY WHO HELPED SPEAR THIS EFFORT OF PARK OF ALL THESE INCREDIBLE MEN AND WOMEN TO CODE BREAK THE NAZI ENIGMA CODE AND --
Jimmy: THE ENIGMA CODE WAS JUST UNBREAKABLE.
UNBREAKABLE, AND JUST THERE WERE 159 MILLION MILLION, MILLION POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS THAT THIS MACHINE COULD BE SET IN BY THE WAY THEY DESIGNED IT. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS AND HE MECHANIZED THE PROCESS AND CREATED THE MACHINE TO FIGHT THE MACHINE. AND YOU KNOW HE WAS SAID BY WINSTON CHURCHILL TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE TO THE OUTCOME OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR.
Jimmy: IF YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE, WHICH, BUT IT'S LIKE -- THIS IS WHY I LOVE MOVIES. BUT YOU GET INTO THIS AND I'M LEARNING ALL THIS STUFF AND YOU SEE THIS MAYBE HANDFUL OF PEOPLE TRYING TO CRACK THIS ENIGMA CODE.
YEAH. AND THEY'RE -- THEIR, SCIENTISTS, MATHEMATICIANS, BUT ALSO ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS, AND ACTORS, YOU KNOW, IT'S A A WIDESPREAD, IT'S A BRAIN DRAIN OF INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.
Jimmy: AND THERE'S NO WAY HUMANS COULD HAVE BROKEN THE CODE REALLY?
IT'S BY SPOTTING HUMAN FAILINGS BECAUSE THE MACHINE ITSELF WAS SORT OF UNBEATABLE.
Jimmy: BY BREAKING THE CODE SAVED --
14 MILLION LIVES IS WHAT IT'S ESTIMATED. 14 MILLION LIVES. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT IT BROUGHT ABOUT A TWO-YEAR EARLY CESSATION TO WORLD WAR II.
Jimmy: GOOD, GOSH. IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.
IF THAT ISN'T UNBELIEVABLE ENOUGH, THEN, THE MAN WAS THEN PROSECUTED IN THE '50s FOR ADMITTING TO BEING GAY AND FACED WITH EITHER TWO YEARS IN PRISON OR TWO YEARS STATE SANCTIONED CHEMICAL CASTRATION THROUGH ESTROGEN INJECTIONS.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST POWERFUL MOVIE IT IS JUST --
I READ IT, I GOT UP AT THE END, I WAS NOT JUST MOVED BUT I WAS FURIOUS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT HIM. THAT THE WORLD DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT HIM. THAT HE WASN'T IN HISTORY BOOKS AND SCIENCE BOOKS AS WELL. AND ON THE -- YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT DARWIN AND NEWTON, THE SCIENTISTS ON DENOMINATIONS OF THE POUND, ON CURRENCY NOTES, AND WHY ISN'T HE ON ONE OF THOSE?

HE WOULDN'T HAVE GOT ANYWHERE WITH IT. IF YOU HAD, YOU WOULN'T BE HIDING CRYPTOGRAPHERS OUT OF UNIVERSITY. YOU NEED ME A LOT MORE THAN I NEED YOU.
I LIKE SOLVING PROBLEMS, COMMANDER. AND ENIGMA IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEM IN THE WORLD.
NO ENIGMA ISN'T DIFFICULT, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THE AMERICANS, THE RUSSIANS, THE FRENCH, THE GERMANS, EVERYONE THINKS ENIGMA IS UNBREAKABLE.
