I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT IT --
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU'RE GREAT IN IT, YOU SHOULD SEE YOU, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SEE YOU AND YOU'RE LIKE. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] EXACTLY, YEAH.
ACTUALLY, ON MY VACATION, I TOOK ONE WEEK VACATION IN JANUARY, DESPERATELY NEEDED THAT VACATION, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO DO WAS SEE THE SHOW BECAUSE I HAD HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT IT. AND SO I BEGGED AND GOT "HAMILTON" TICKETS. I KNEW A GUY.
Jimmy: YOU KNEW A GUY. HOOKED YOU UP.
SO THEY SAT ME IN LIKE THE FAMOUS PERSON'S SECTION. SO I CAME IN --
Jimmy: OH, YOU REALLY DID?
OH YEAH, I REALLY SAW IT? AND THEY SAT ME --
Jimmy: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF YOU?
I THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE GOT DRESSED A LITTLE EARLIER. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK HE NEEDED A LITTLE MORE PREP TIME. I SAW THE SHOW. AND I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHO I WAS SITTING AROUND. WE GOT THERE, MY WIFE AND I GOT THERE LIKE RIGHT BEFORE CURTAIN. AND SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE AROUND PEOPLE THAT MATTER, RIGHT. THERE WAS A GUY THAT WAS A A LITTLE DISRUPTIVE DOWN THE ROW. TALKING, SINGING A LITTLE BIT. HE'S A LITTLE BIT DISRUPTIVE TO -- THERE'S A GROUP PEOPLE IN FRONT OF US AND THEY'RE GETTING VERY AGITATED. THE WOMAN'S TURNING AROUND. SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, "STOP TALKING." IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT. YOU DON'T TALK IN A SHOW. CAN YOU PLEASE STOP TALKING? SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHO ANYBODY WAS. I JUST KNEW THAT I SHOULD STAY OUT OF IT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE HEAVIES, RIGHT. SO THE LIGHTS COME UP AT INTERMISSION. I ELBOW MY WIFE, LIKE, IT'S GOING DOWN. LIKE, DON'T KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE, BUT IT'S GOING DOWN. THE NIGHT, THAT NIGHT, THE WOMAN GETS UP, SHE TURNS AROUND, IT'S SHONDA RHIMES. AND THE DUDE IS ART GARFUNKEL. SHONDA RHIMES -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT? THEY ALMOST FOUGHT EACH OTHER?
SHONDA RHIMES ALMOST WHOOPED ART GARFUNKEL'S ASS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT?
I HAVE TO LET YOU KNOW. BECAUSE -- I'VE SINCE TALKED TO HER ABOUT IT. SHE FLEW HER THREE BEST FRIENDS IN TO TOWN TO SEE THE SHOW. MR. GARFUNKEL, HE WAS ON SOME OTHER STUFF. HE WAS -- YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: HE'S VERY MUSICAL. THIS IS VERY MUSICAL.
IT ALMOST WENT DOWN.
Jimmy: THAT'S A PLAY IN ITSELF. I WOULD GO SEE THAT PLAY. SHONDA AND ART GARFUNKEL -- WE WERE TALKING BACKSTAGE AND YOU HAVE A TALENT THAT NOT MANY OF THE OTHER CAST MEMBERS -- EVERYONE'S SO TALENTED. BUT YOU HAVE THIS ONE TALENT THAT I THINK IS SO INTERESTING. YOU WON'T BURP AFTER YOU -- YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT IN?
I HAVE A LOT OF THE HEAVY LIFTING TO DO AS FAR AS MATERIAL. I HAVE TO EAT A FULL MEAL AT INTERMISSION BECAUSE FOR ENERGY.
Jimmy: SURE.
INEVITABLY I HAVE TO BURP AT SOME POINT DURING ACT TWO. AND SO YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SING ABOVE AND BELOW AND AROUND THAT BURP. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HAVE TO CARVE OUT A LITTLE SPACE IN YOUR LARYNX. YOU GOT TO SING LIKE AROUND IT.
Jimmy: NO ONE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] I WANT TO SEE -- I HATE TO PUT YOU TO THE TEST. HERE'S SELTZER, OKAY THIS IS ONE OF THE GASSIEST BEVERAGES KNOWN TO MAN. I'M GOING TO POUR A LITTLE FOR YOU HERE. DRINK THAT. AND THEN I HAVE A MICROPHONE HERE. AND YOU CAN SING WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SING. I WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN GO IN, AROUND, SIDEWAYS AND AROUND AND FLOAT AROUND THE BURP.
