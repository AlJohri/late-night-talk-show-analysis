[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN TONIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AT HOME.
Audience Member: I LOVE YOU JIMMY!
Jimmy: I LOVE YOU TOO, MAN. I LOVE YOU TOO. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, IT'S STILL THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE. THINGS HAVE GOTTEN VERY TENSE NOW BETWEEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA. IN FACT DURING A SPEECH TODAY VLADIMIR PUTIN CRITICIZED THE U.S. FOR ALWAYS THINKING THAT IT'S ALWAYS RIGHT. WE'RE ALWAYS THINKING THAT WE'RE RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN HE WENT BACK TO ORGANIZING AN ELECTION WHERE YOU CAN'T VOTE "NO." [ APPLAUSE ] [ IMITATING PUTIN ] "EITHER MIGHT RIGHT NOW OR LATER." IT'S LIKE A NETFLIX ACCOUNT. [ IMITATING PUTIN ] "ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO CANCEL NOW? YOU MUST CANCEL NETFLIX LATER OR WE'LL COME BACK? TRY FREE MOVIES, WANT TO TRY FOR A WEEKEND MAYBE?" "NO, I DON'T WANT IT ANY MORE." [ IMITATING PUTIN ] "OKAY, LOOK. I'LL PRETEND YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING." "I DON'T WANT IT." WELL NOW WE'RE IMPOSING SANCTIONS AGAINST CERTAIN RUSSIAN OFFICIALS. SO NOW THEY CAN'T VISIT AMERICA ANYMORE, THEY CAN'T DO BUSINESS WITH AMERICA. AND PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT THESE SANCTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO SHOW PUTIN THAT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO HIS ACTIONS. YEAH. PUTIN WAS LIKE -- [ IMITATING PUTIN ] "I SEE, I SEE. LIKE IF MY ACTION IS TAKE CRIMEA FROM UKRAINE, THEN I GET CRIMEA FROM UKRAINE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I SEE THE CONSEQUENCES. YEA, THAT IS PRETTY COOL, MAN. THANK YOU FOR THAT. APPRECIATE IT." EVEN JOE BIDEN NOW IS WEIGHING IN. TODAY BIDEN SAID THAT RUSSIA'S RECENT ACTIONS IN THE UKRAINE HAVE LEFT IT ALONE AND NAKED IN FRONT OF THE REST OF THE WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] INCIDENTALLY, ALONE AND NAKED IS ALSO PUTIN'S PREFERRED STYLE OF HUNTING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ IMITATING PUTIN ] "WHERE ARE YOU, BEAR?" [ SOUTHERN ACCENT ] "COME OUT, COME OUT, WHEREEVER YOU ARE." [ IMITATING PUTIN ] "I'M DOING IMPRESSIONS. I DO IMPRESSIONS. TO HUNT BEAR, YOU HAVE TO DRESS LIKE THAT. TOTALLY NAKED. VERY HAIRY THOUGH." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT OBAMA IS TAKING A LOT OF HEAT NOW FOR HOW HE'S DEALT WITH THE SITUATION. THIS WEEK MITT ROMNEY SAID THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE IS A A RESULT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BAD TIMING. WHEN HE HEARD THAT, PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS LIKE -- "MY WHAT?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] INCIDENTALLY, BAD TIMING IS ALSO WHAT MITT ROMNEY HAS WHEN HE'S TRYING TO DO THE WAVE AT THE BASEBALL GAME. [ LAUGHTER ] "DANG IT! I MISSED IT AGAIN. TAG, TELL ME WHEN IT'S COMING AROUND. [ LAUGHTER ] DANG IT! I HATE THESE THINGS. YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GOING TO STAND UP AND DO THIS UNTIL IT COMES BACK AROUND. I DON'T CARE. I'LL BUY THE WHOLE DAMN TEAM." [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS THOUGH, OUT OF WASHINGTON. THE WHITE HOUSE REVEALED THAT MORE THAN FIVE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE NOW SIGNED UP FOR OBAMACARE. YEAH, THANKS TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECENT PUSH, FIVE MILLION. THAT'S RIGHT. AND IF FIVE MILLION SIGNED UP, THAT MEANS AT LEAST 50 MILLION TRIED TO SIGN UP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO I MEAN, THESE ARE THE PATIENT ONES WHO WAITED IT OUT. I'LL WAIT. SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS. THIS WEEK, RNC CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS -- THAT'S HIS REAL NAME. REINCE? IS IT -- REINCE. SORRY, REINCE PRIEBUS. R-E-I-N-C-E P-R-I-E-B-U-S. REINCE -- I GUESS IT IS WHAT IT READS LIKE. [ LAUGHTER ] REINCE PRIEBUS SAID THAT THE GOP STILL ISN'T WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2016. YEAH, IT'S NOT WHERE IT SHOULD BE. KIND OF LIKE THE LETTERS IN REINCE PRIEBUS. [ LAUGHTER ] REINCE PRIEBUS. OH, I'VE DONE ONE OF THESE BEFORE. ERNIE SPICERUB. THERE YOU GO. THAT'S HIS NAME. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS HAS JUST BEEN ALL OVER THE INTERNET IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. YESTERDAY IN LOS ANGELES THERE WAS A 4.4 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE. AND THERE WEREN'T ANY INJURIES OR SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE. BUT WHEN IT HAPPENED, THE LOCAL NEWS WAS ON THE AIR, LIVE.

AND JAPAN JUST ANNOUNCED THAT PIKACHU WILL BE THEIR OFFICIAL TEAM MASCOT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT IS PRETTY COOL. THAT MAKES SENSE. PIKACHU IS THE MOST POPULAR POKEMON. BUT THAT LEAVES OUT A LOT OTHER POKEMON WHO AREN'T DOING AS WELL. AND WE CAUGHT UP WITH A BUNCH OF THEM. TAKE A LOOK. FIRST WE HAVE JIGGLYPUFF. JIGGLYPUFF WENT ON TO BECOME THE LEAST POPULAR POWERPUFF GIRL, WHICH WAS VERY CONFUSING. VERY CONFUSING. THEN THERE OF COURSE IS SPOINK. HE WAS CONFISCATED BY THE TSA IN 2008. AND STILL SITTING IN A BIN AT LaGUARDIA. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BRING THEM ON THE PLANE ANYMORE. AND FINALLY THERE'S LICKITUNG. [ LAUGHTER ] LICKITUNG WON $10,000 IN A A MILEY CYRUS LOOK-ALIKE CONTEST. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS FANTASTIC. GOOD FOR LICKITUNG. DOING SOMETHING WITH HIMSELF. [ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ] AND GET THIS NOW, RESEARCHERS IN CHINA HAVE DEVELOPED THESE THINGS CALLED SMART TAGS THAT STICK TO CONTAINERS AND CHANGE COLOR WHEN THE FOOD HAS GONE BAD. IN ADDITION TO THAT OTHER THING THAT CHANGES COLOR WHEN FOOD GOES BAD -- FOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE -- "HONEY, IS THIS GREEN PORK CHOP STILL GOOD? I DIDN'T SEE A STICKER ON IT, HONEY. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW I'M GONNA EAT IT. I DON'T CARE. HONEY." OH, SHE'S DEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS REALLY BIG. RESEARCHERS JUST ANNOUNCED A A GROUND-BREAKING DISCOVERY THAT SOME SAY NOT ONLY PROVES THAT THE BIG BANG THEORY HAPPENED, BUT ALSO WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER. AND THEN AMERICANS SAID, "YEAH, ISN'T IT JUST 'TWO AND A HALF MEN'?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY ARE SAYING THAT THIS DISCOVERY PROVES THAT THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT. WHEN I HEARD THAT, I WAS LIKE -- ♪♪ [ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ] WHOA!

Jimmy: YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN SOMEONE'S HAVING FUN DOING IT. AND I CAN JUST TELL YOU WERE LIKE "THIS IS SO FUN."
IT WAS SO FUN. THE ENTIRE WEEK WAS LIKE A A DREAM. LIKE, I NEVER WENT INTO MY DRESSING ROOM WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO. I JUST STOOD AROUND IN STUDIO 8H HARASSING PEOPLE AND ASKING WALLY THE QUEUE CARD GUY, "HOW DOES THIS WORK EXACTLY?"

AND WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. BECAUSE WE BOTH, THIS --
THIS IS EXCITING. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS. YOU KNOW I HAVE A DEEP AND ABIDING PASSION FOR YOU. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE.

THERE WERE THREE -- I KNEW WHERE MR. VIDEO 2 WAS. I THINK MR. VIDEO 1 HAD, LIKE, BIT THE DUST LONG BEFORE.
Jimmy: YEAH, THERE WAS NO VIDEO 1. I JUST HAD VIDEO 2. I THINK -- I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WAS CALLED THAT.
MAYBE THE OWNER WAS LIKE, "HERE'S WHAT YOU DO. YOU MAKE 'EM THINK YOU'VE GOT TWO OF THEM." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AHH. TRICK PEOPLE, LIKE THIS IS A A CHAIN.
LIKE, IT'S A CHAIN. IT'S ESTABLISHED.
Jimmy: LIKE FAMOUS RAY'S. FAMOUS VIDEO 2.
WELL, ADDING FAMOUS TO THE BEGINNING OF ANY PIZZA PLACE -- SUDDENLY, YOU'RE LIKE, "WE SHOULD STOP THERE. IT'S FAMOUS."
Jimmy: YEAH, THEY'RE FAMOUS. YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH.
BUT WORKING AT A VIDEO STORE IS KIND OF AN AMAZING JOB. AND I FEEL SO SAD THAT VIDEO STORE PEOPLE, LIKE VIDEO STORE GUYS ESPECIALLY, ARE KIND OF GOING THE WAY OF THE DINOSAURS. LIKE, THAT WAS AN AMAZING -- YOU, AS A VIDEO STORE GUY WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AMAZING CULTURAL MOMENT.
Jimmy: BECAUSE I WOULD GIVE ADVICE TO PEOPLE ON WHAT TO RENT?
VIDEO STORE GUYS ARE LIKE KIND OF MEAN. THEY THINK THEY'RE SMARTER THAN EVERYONE. THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE THEY WORK AT A VIDEO STORE. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S JUST A REALLY AMAZING TYPE.
Jimmy: NO, I WAS NOT -- I DIDN'T REALLY GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS OR ANY OF THAT STUFF. I JUST TOOK -- I JUST DID MY JOB. I GOT THE VIDEOS, TYPED IN THE COMPUTER, WENT RENTED THE THING AND THAT WAS IT.
YOU'RE SO LUCKY THEY LET YOU USE THE COMPUTER.
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW DUMB YOU WERE? [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DIDN'T EVEN LET YOU USE THE COMPUTER?
NO! WELL, I WAS LIKE 14, SO I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING ILLEGAL ABOUT HAVING ME ON THE REGISTER.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, I WAS LIKE 17.
I MADE $4.75 AN HOUR AND I WAS LIKE, "I'M RICH, MOFOS! YOU CAN'T STOP ME NOW!"
Jimmy: AND DID YOU GET FREE RENTALS OR ANYTHING.
OH YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT'D YOU LIKE? DID YOU HAVE YOUR GO-TO? DID YOU GET TO CONTROL ON ALL THE SCREENS IN THE STORE?
NO. THERE WAS LIKE TWO 24-YEAR-OLD GUYS, WHO TO ME WERE LIKE -- THEY MIGHT AS WELL BEEN 57.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
AND THEY LIKE -- IT WAS TIM BURTON ON A LOOP.
Jimmy: THEY JUST LOVED TIM BURTON.
THEY LOVED TIM BURTON.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SAL AND RAFF. WHAT UP, SAL AND RAFF? AND THEY WERE REALLY COOL GUYS. AND THEY WERE LIKE, THEY HAD REAL OPINIONS ABOUT FILM. WHEREAS I WAS LIKE, "WHATEVER RESSE WITHERSPOON IS IN, GIVE IT TO ME."
Jimmy: YEAH! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. "MAN ON THE MOON," MAN. THAT'S MY JAM!
I HEARD WE HAVE THAT IN COMMON. IT'S LITERALLY MY FAVORITE MOVIE.
Jimmy: NO. IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALL-TIME MOVIES EVER. "MAN ON THE MOON," REESE WITHERSPOON.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO PROCESS THAT RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT FREAKED ME OUT.
BECAUSE THAT MOVIE FORMED MY ENTIRE IDEA ABOUT ROMANCE, WHICH COULDN'T BE HEALTHY BECAUSE --
Jimmy: SHE LEARNED HOW TO KISS, LIKE, ON HER HAND.
SHE LEARNED HOW TO KISS ON HER KNEE!
Jimmy: ON HER KNEE, THAT'S RIGHT.
SHE'S LIKE, MAKING OUT WITH HER KNEE AND LISTENING TO ELVIS RECORDS. AND THEN --
Jimmy: ELVIS RECORDS. SLEEPING ON THE FRONT PORCH BECAUSE THAT'S HOW BALMY IT IS IN THE SOUTH.
YEAH, SO BALMY. AND THEN THE GUY THAT SHE LIKES IMPREGNATES HER SISTER, THEN GETS RUN OVER BY A TRACTOR.
Jimmy: A TRACTOR! THE BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN! IT WAS SO GOOD. SERIOUSLY, I'VE SEEN IT PROBABLY 100 TIMES. IT'S ONE OF THE LONDONS. JEREMY OR JASON LONDON?
YEAH, IT WAS AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE I BELIEVE BY SAM WATERSTON AS HER FATHER.
Jimmy: SAM WATERSTON COMES RUNNING AFTER HER IN THE RAIN.
IN THE STORM.
Jimmy: BECAUSE SHE MADE -- SHE RAN OFF AND SHE WAS TRYING TO SEE JEREMY OR JASON LONDON. AND THEN HER MOTHER GOES LOOKING FOR HER -- WHAT WAS HER NAME AGAIN?
HER NAME WAS -- OH, MY GOD, HER NAME WAS -- IT WASN'T LIKE MARMY, BUT IT WAS SOME CUTE, SOUTHERN --
Jimmy: YEAH, I LOVED HER NAME. IT WAS SO COOL. IT WAS LIKE ALMOST A BOY NAME OR SOMETHING.
YEAH, CHARLIE.
Jimmy: BILLY OR SOMETHING. CHARLIE?
I THINK IT WAS BILLY OR CHARLIE. AND THEN, HER MOTHER'S RUNNING AFTER HER. AND HER MOTHER'S PREGNANT, AND SHE FALLS.
Jimmy: TRIPS ON SOMETHING, AND HE GOES -- HE COMES BACK AND THERE'S RAIN ALL OVER SAM WATERSTON. HE'S SO MAD RIGHT NOW. HE GOES, "WHERE WERE YOU? WHAT WERE YOU DOING?" [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S SO GOOD!
Jimmy: I LOVE IT SO MUCH.
I ALSO THINK OF SUCH A A SPECIFIC CULTURAL MOMENT WHEN, LIKE, JEREMY OR JASON LONDON COULD DESTROY A A FAMILY.
Jimmy: YEAH. THEY GET TO TAKE IT DOWN. THEY WERE LIKE THE GOOD LOOKING NEW KID, WHO WAS DOWN BY THE SWIMMING HOLE.
I LOVED IT SO MUCH. SHE ATE, LIKE, RAW WALNUTS. IN THE MOVIE SHE SAT THERE SHELLING WALNUTS AND LISTENING TO ELVIS. THERE WAS A WHOLE SUMMER WHERE I JUST SAT OUT ON MY FRONT PORCH. WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY WALNUTS, SO I WOULD JUST EAT PEANUTS AND BE LIKE, "MOM, DAD, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE."
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. TRYING TO BE -- YEAH. I REMEMBER LIKE HER DAD WENT TO -- HE DIDN'T GO TO CHURCH, HE WENT -- EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY HAD TO GO TO CHURCH, BUT HE WENT OUT ON A ROW BOAT AND WENT FISHING.
DO YOU REALIZE THIS IS THE MOST SCREENTIME THIS FILM HAS EVER GOTTEN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE LOVE IT SO MUCH THOUGH.
IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY.
Jimmy: IT'S A CLASSIC. OH, MY GOSH, WE HAVE TO WATCH "MAN ON THE MOON."
DID I TELL YOU WHAT MY MOM SAID ABOUT YOU RECENTLY?
Jimmy: NO.
WELL, IT WAS NICE. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE A GREAT BOYFRIEND. MY FAMILY LOVES HIM. MY GRANDMA LOVES HIM. KNOCK ON WOOD. HE'LL CONTINUE TO STAND BY MY SIDE. BUT, MY MOM SAID RECENTLY, "I LOVE HIM. I HOPE YOU'RE WITH HIM FOREVER, BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU'D MARRY JIMMY FALLON." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I, LIKE -- THAT IS -- I LIKE YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE AND YOUR CHILD. I'M NOT TRYING TO GET UP IN ANYONE.
Jimmy: NO, I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND. NOR I. NOR I. NOR I, BUT --
BUT I JUST LOVE THE WAY SHE SAID IT, LIKE WE HAD A PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP. LIKE YOU WERE LIKE MY FIRST BOYFRIEND AND THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT. SHE THOUGHT WE'D GET BACK TOGETHER.
Jimmy: THANKS, MOM.
NOT LIKE I HAD 50 MAGAZINE COVERS OF YOU UP IN MY BATHROOM.
Jimmy: I MEAN, THAT'S HILARIOUS. THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]
I KNEW THIS WOULD MAKE YOU A A LITTLE EMBARRASSED.
Jimmy: A LITTLE BIT EMBARRASSED. LET'S TALK ABOUT "GIRLS." LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SHOW "GIRLS." HERE WE GO. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT GIRLS. LET'S TALK ABOUT BOYS.
YEAH. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
Jimmy: WE'RE GOING TO TURN THIS INTO A SLUMBER PARTY. "GIRLS," HERE'S THE BIG SEASON FINALE.
