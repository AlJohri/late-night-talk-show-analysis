Jimmy: HEY, EVERYBODY. HELLO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
Steve: THAT'S A CROWD.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. HOT CROWD. HOT CROWD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." OH, IT'S GOING TO BE FUN. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, EVERYBODY. I SAW THAT DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE UPSET WITH THE SHOW "FAMILY GUY" AFTER IT RECENTLY MADE FUN OF TRUMP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I SEE BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE. ON ONE HAND, IT'S JUST A A CARTOON. BUT THAT CARTOON COULD BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SO, I MEAN, THEY SHOULD BE -- [ APPLAUSE ] BUT NOW THAT TRUMP IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, HE'S STARTING TO SET HIS SIGHTS ON HILLARY CLINTON. BUT HILLARY DISMISSED TRUMP'S ATTACKS, ESPECIALLY ON HER PERSONAL LIFE SAYING HE'S USING A PLAYBOOK FROM THE '90s. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH BACKFIRED WHEN AMERICANS WERE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, WE LOVE THE '90s." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "FULL HOUSE." "URKEL." DID I DO THAT? I LOVE IT. SPEAKING OF HILLARY, YESTERDAY THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT IT CAN'T FIND ANY E-MAILS BELONGING TO HILLARY CLINTON'S SENIOR TECHNOLOGY STAFFERS FROM WHEN CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE. THEN HILLARY SAID, "YOU WON'T FIND THAT STAFFER EITHER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BRING THE CAR AROUND, BUDDY. FOR MORE NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON, THEY FINALLY GOT SOMETHING DONE AND PASSED A A BILL, THAT'S RIGHT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED A LAW THAT MAKES THE BISON THE OFFICIAL MAMMAL OF THE UNITED STATES. [ APPLAUSE ] AFTER HEARING THE NEWS, AMERICAN BUFFALO SAID, "YES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WAIT, ARE WE BISON? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE ARE BISON, RIGHT? IS THAT RIGHT? WE LOOK LIKE THAT." PEOPLE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. A TEAM OF SCIENTISTS AT M.I.T. HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW CREAM THAT TIGHTENS SKIN AND PROVIDES A A TEMPORARY FACELIFT. IT REALLY MAKES PEOPLE LOOK YOUNGER. LOOK AT WHAT IT DID FOR BERNIE SANDERS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
Steve: UNBELIEVABLE.
Jimmy: YEAH, UNBELIEVABLE.
Steve: I DON'T BELIEVE IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: UNBELIEVABLE.
Steve: YEAH, YOU GOT TO BELIEVE IT.
Jimmy: I SAW THAT SNAPCHAT RAN INTO A LITTLE TROUBLE RECENTLY. HEAR ABOUT THIS? THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO APOLOGIZE TO A RUSSIAN ARTIST AFTER THEY USED SOME OF HIS ARTWORK FOR ONE OF THEIR FILTERS WITHOUT ASKING PERMISSION. THE ARTIST SAID THE WHOLE ORDEAL MADE HIM SO UPSET, VERY UPSET, HE WAS UP ALL NIGHT PUKING RAINBOWS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NEW RESEARCH FINDS THAT RE-TWEETING AND SHARING POSTS CAN CREATE COGNITIVE OVERLOAD AND CAN MAKE YOU FORGET WHAT YOU READ. NOT ONLY THAT, NEW RESEARCH FINDS THAT RE-TWEETING AND SHARING POSTS CAN CREATE COGNITIVE OVERLOAD AND MAKE YOU FORGET WHAT YOU READ. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THINK ABOUT IT. YOU GUYS KNOW PERISCOPE? FAMILIAR WITH THAT? IT'S THAT STREAMING APP YOU CAN USE TO PUBLISH VIDEOS. THEY'RE NOW TESTING OUT A A FEATURE THAT WILL LET YOU SAVE YOUR BROADCAST INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM DISAPPEAR AFTER 24 HOURS. YEAH, IT'S CALLED YOUTUBE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TRY IT. KIND OF COOL. A LITTLE BUSINESS NEWS HERE. I READ THAT JCPENNEY IS TRYING TO CUT EXPENSES BY REDUCING EMPLOYEE'S HOURS. WHEN ASKED WHEN THE CHANGES WILL GO INTO EFFECT, THE COMPANY'S CEO WAS JUST A A MANNEQUIN IN A SUIT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE CUTTING BACK STARTING TODAY. THIS MADE ME LAUGH. AN OPERA SINGER IN ANTARCTICA PERFORMED FOR SOME PENGUINS -- [ LAUGHTER ] PERFORMED FOR SOME PENGUINS THIS WEEK. BUT I DON'T THINK THE PENGUINS WERE TOO IMPRESSED. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. ♪♪
OH, WAIT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OPERA SUCKS! YOU THINK THEY'D LOVE OPERA SINCE THEY'RE ALL WEARING TUXEDOS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS GOING VIRAL HERE, YOU GUYS. SOMEONE IN SCOTLAND STAKED OUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS A PERFECT SPOT TO FILM A BUILDING THAT WAS GETTING DEMOLISHED THIS WEEK. YEAH. THINGS DIDN'T GO EXACTLY AS PLANNED. CHECK THIS OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. COOL BUS. YOU DON'T GET TO SEE THAT EVERYDAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GLAD THEY GOT THAT BUS ON FILM.
Jimmy: HEY, GUYS, HERE'S A A LOCAL STORY. NEW YORK'S CITY COUNCIL RECENTLY VOTED TO CHARGE PEOPLE 5 CENTS PER PLASTIC BAG. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. SOON, NEW YORKERS CAN PAY 5 CENTS FOR A PLASTIC BAG OR JUST WALK OUTSIDE AND WAIT FOR ONE TO BLOW INTO YOUR FACE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OH, AND FINALLY, THIS IS KIND OF AWESOME. YESTERDAY, THE PLANET MERCURY CROSSED IN FRONT OF THE SUN. YOU HEAR OF THIS? IT HASN'T HAPPENED IN TEN YEARS. SCIENTISTS WARN THAT LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THE EVENT COULD CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR EYES. BUT NASA RELEASED SOME FOOTAGE OF WHAT THEY SAY IS SAFE TO WATCH. IT'S PRETTY AMAZING. IT HAPPENS SUPERFAST BUT IS VERY COOL LOOKING. CHECK THIS OUT. YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] COOL BUS.

Jimmy: HI. YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER. THIS IS AWESOME. HAPPY BELATED MOTHER'S DAY TO BOTH OF YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HOW'S THE REST OF THE FAMILY?
THEY'RE GREAT. THEY'RE DOING GREAT.
Jimmy: YOUR HUSBAND DOING WELL?
HE'S DOING REALLY WELL. HE'S DOING A LOT OF PAINTING.
Jimmy: HE IS? [ LAUGHTER ] I AM OBSESSED WITH HIS PANTING. I THINK THEIR FANTASTIC.
YOU'VE ONLY SEEN THE VERY EARLY ONES.
THE NAKED PORTRAIT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT -- A A COUPLE POSES.
HE'S A PORTRAIT PAINTER.
HE'S PROGRESSED.
Jimmy: HE HAS PROGRESSED.
HE NOW PAINTS PUTIN.
Jimmy: NO!
HE DID, WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO?
Jimmy: HE DID? [ LAUGHTER ]
I MEAN, THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. THAT'S ALREADY BEEN A SHOW. HE PAINTED WORLD LEADERS THAT HE SERVED WITH.
Jimmy: HOW DID IT START?
HE GOT THE APP ON HIS IPHONE. "PENULTIMATE." HE DREW THESE VERY FUNNY STICK FIGURE CHARACTERS.
ACTUALLY A PERIOD WHERE HE ONLY COMMUNICATED THROUGH HIS ART. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OF COURSE, HE'S AN ARTIST.
HE WOULD ONLY EMAIL THEM TO US.
HE WOULD SEND BARBARA AND ME A TEXT, LIKE GOING ON AN AIRPLANE, AND HE WOULD DO A A STICK FIGURE OF AN AIRPLANE. [ LAUGHTER ]
HE DID A RECTANGLE WITH HIS HEAD AND BARNEY PAINTED ON THE BOTTOM "GOOD NIGHT."
Jimmy: AW.
FOR WHATEVER REASON, MY MOTHER, WHO'S ALWAYS THE SUPPORTIVE WIFE, SAW ONE OF THESE AND SAID, "GEORGE, THAT'S VERY INTERESTING LINES." AND THEN IT TOOK OFF.
Jimmy: THAT INSPIRED HIM TO ACTUALLY JUST GO ON AND START PAINTING?
THAT'S ALL HE NEEDED.
Jimmy: IT'S PHENOMENAL. MAYBE THE NEXT BOOK, HE HAS TO DO AT LEAST ONE IN THERE.
HE DOESN'T REALLY DO DRAWINGS LIKE THIS.
Jimmy: NO, THESE ARE AMAZING, THESE ARE FANTASTIC. DID YOU -- YOU DIDN'T START -- DID YOU START -- ARE YOU INTO THE IPAD AND STUFF TOO, THE WHOLE FAMILY?
WITH THE KIDS? IT'S A PROBLEM, RIGHT. YOU HAVE KIDS MY KID'S AGE.
Jimmy: THEY'RE SO GOOD AT THAT.
IT'S SCARY. AND SHE'S SO MANIPULATIVE, MY THREE-YEAR-OLD, IN A GOOD WAY, IF YOU CAN BE MANIPULATIVE IN A A GOOD WAY. >>Jimmy: YEAH, YOU CAN.
SHE STEALS MY MOM'S IPHONE EVERY TIME SHE COMES HOME. EVERY TIMES SHE COMES OVER SHE STEALS IT AND I'M LIKE WHERE'S MILA? AND SHE'S LIKE, OH SHE'S SITTING ON THE POTTY WITH MY IPHONE.
Jimmy: EXACTLY, YEAH. DO YOU USE THE APPS AND ALL THAT STUFF?
YEAH, SURE OF COURSE.
Jimmy: EMOJIS AND ALL THAT?
YEAH. WELL, SHE STARTED OFF WRITING -- WHAT BARBARA AND I CALL MOM TEXTS. SHE WOULD WRITE, "DEAR JENNA, GROCERY STORE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DEAR JENNA, YEAH.
"DEAR JENNA, GROCERY STORE, LOVE, MOM." LIKE, MOM, IT SAYS -- LIKE, WE KNOW IT'S FROM YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] WE GOT IT.
Jimmy: I LIKE IN THE BOOK, IT STARTS OFF WITH THIS LITTLE GIRL AND SHE'S PLANNING HER SUMMER VACATION WITH HER FRIENDS AND SHE'S LIKE WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? OH, I'M GOING TO START A A YOUTUBE CHANNEL. THEY'RE ALL ON THEIR IPADS AND PHONES. I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THE SPACESHIP GAME. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS, THEIR PARENTS SURPRISE THEM BY GOING ON A TRIP AROUND THE COUNTRY.
RIGHT, THE GREAT AMERICAN ROAD TRIP.
Jimmy: OF COURSE ALL THE PARKS. SHE'S LIKE, OH, MY GOSH. I DON'T WANT TO GO CAMPING! EW, I HATE CAMPING! I WANT TO STAY AT HOME AND TEXT MY FRIENDS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHICH IS WHAT EVERYONE DOES. BUT THEN AS THE BOOK GOES ON YOU GET TO SEE HOW COOL AND HOW AWESOME OUR COUNTRY IS. YOU GO, OH, YEAH, THE STARS AT NIGHT, YOU KNOW.
WELL, SHE REALLY SAID, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO SEE. THIS WAS AN EVERGLADE. THERE ARE TONS OF THINGS TO SEE. IT'S BECAUSE SHE WAS LOOKING DOWN. THAT'S WHAT SCARES ME ABOUT OUR KID'S GENERATION. IS THAT MILA, WHEN WE'RE DRIVING SOMEWHERE, EVEN IN NEW YORK CITY, THERE'S SO MUCH TO SEE. SHE JUST WANTS TO LOOK AT MY IPHONE AND WATCH, "PEPPA PIG."
Jimmy: WE LOVE, "PEPPA PIG."
"PEPPA PIG," IS GREAT.
Jimmy: BUT OUTDOORS, YOU CAN'T BEAT OUTDOORS OR LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL MOON. THAT'S WHAT "GOOD NIGHT MOON" IS ABOUT, THE MOON.
WHICH BY THE WAY, MILA DID NOT KNOW EXISTED. SHE DIDN'T KNOW A MOON EXISTED UNTIL WE WENT TO TEXAS. SHE LOOKS UP AND GOES MOON.
Jimmy: YEA IT'S THE BEST THING - THAT'S THE BEST THING EVER. YOU DO A LOT OF TRAVELING WITH THESE KIDS? BUS THEM AROUND EVERYWHERE?
DO YOU?
SHE'S ASKING YOU.
BARBARA AND JENNA, SURE, WE TOOK THEM EVERYWHERE WE WENT, BACK IN THE DAYS THAT WE TRAVELED LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: I HAVE A PICTURE OF YOU. JUST YOUR FRIENDS.
OH, YEAH, THESE ARE MY CAMPING FRIENDS. THESE ARE THE WOMEN I GREW UP WITH IN MIDLAND, MY BEST FRIENDS. WE'VE HIKED IN A NATIONAL PARK EVERY SUMMER FOR 30 YEARS.
Jimmy: IS THAT COOL?
AND THEY TOOK US, THIS IS THEIR, YOU KNOW, YEARLY TRIP. THE ONE SUMMER THEY TOOK US, THE GIRLS.
THE GIRLS, THE CHILDREN.
Jimmy: THE DAUGHTERS.
THE DAUGHTERS ALONG. AND THEY NEVER DID IT AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE WAS TOO MUCH MAMA DRAMA.
Jimmy: THAT'S ENOUGH.
FIGHTS WITH SOME OF THE MOMS AND DAUGHTERS. THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK.
Jimmy: I LOVE-- I MEAN LOOK AT THAT, JUST THE GRAND CANYON. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE GRAND CANYON. I WOULD LOVE TO GO.
IT'S SO GREAT.
IF WE DID THIS RAFTING TRIP, WHICH IS REALLY FUN, WE STAYED IN A TENT FOR TEN DAYS, SO IT SHOWS HOW MUCH -- YOU KNOW, THEY DUG A HOLE. THERE WAS NO TOILET.
Jimmy: I REALLY DID WANT TO GO THERE BUT, SEE -- [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW -- HOW DO YOU GET THERE? LIKE, WHERE DO YOU -- SERIOUSLY, WHERE DO YOU PARK OR WHATEVER? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WELL, YOU CAN DRIVE UP LIKE MOST TOURISTS DO AND LOOK OVER THE SOUTH RIM. OR YOU CAN HIKE IN. WE GOT IN AND FLOATED ON THE COLORADO RIVER AND THEN HIKED OUT THE TEN MILES TO THE SOUTH RIM.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S RIGHT, THEY DO HAVE THAT NEW BRIDGE, SEE-THROUGH GLASS.
EXACTLY.
AND THAT'S IN THE BOOK, THE SEE-THROUGH GLASS.
Jimmy: THERE'S SO MANY GOOD THINGS IN THE BOOK. THERE'S SOME EASTER EGGS IN THE BOOKS TOO.
THERE'S ONE YOU HAVE TO SEE BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU HAVE A A SECRET CRUSH ON SOMEBODY IN OUR FAMILY.
Jimmy: GRANDMA.
GRANDMA.
Jimmy: I LOVE HER SO MUCH. SHE ALWAYS MAKES ME LAUGH AND SHE -- MAKES ME LAUGH, MAKES ME CRY TOO. SHE'S A TOUGHY.
I WAS GOING TO SAY TRY BEING HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.
Jimmy: SHE'S A TOUGHY. SHE TELLS YOU WHAT'S UP.
THIS, RIGHT HERE THE SPACESHIP, WE NAMED THE ENFORCER.
Jimmy: THAT'S HER NICKNAME.
THAT'S HER NICKNAME.
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, YEAH, SHE'S THE ENFORCER. OH, GOOD I LOVE THAT --
SHE SAYS, NO MATTER WHAT, WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO.
Jimmy: PLEASE GIVE HER MY LOVE.
