I MEAN, JUST IMAGINE THE RIFT IT CAUSED, WHEN HE WAS LIKE, "DAD, YOU'RE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF THE SHOW, YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN?" I WAS LIKE, "SORRY, SON."
Jimmy: YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN A A LESSON SOME DAY.
YEAH, BETTER TO LEARN IT IN THE HOUSE THAN IN THE STREETS. BUT HE WENT OUT AND GOT HIS OWN TELEVISION SHOW, MAN. HE'S DOING A LIVE ACTION VERSION OF RICHIE RICH. NETFLIX IS RELEASING THAT IN A A COUPLE WEEKS, SO I'M EXCITED FOR HIM.
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
AND WHAT HE DID FOR ME I COULDN'T DO FOR HIM. I JUST HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SET HANGING OUT WITH HIM ONE DAY. AND THEY CAME DOWN AND SAID, "WE JUST WROTE THIS ROLE FOR HIM TO HAVE A FATHER. WOULD YOU MIND PLAYING HIS FATHER?" MY SON TURNED TO ME AND SAID, "SEE, THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENS, POP." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I WAS LIKE, OKAY.
Jimmy: TOUCHE.
TOUCHE.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
I GOT YOU. I GOT YOU.
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT, ABSOLUTELY.
SO, I GOT TO WORK WITH HIM AS HIS FATHER ON HIS TELEVISION SHOW. SO, THAT WAS FUN.
Jimmy: THAT'S AWESOME, BUDDY. DO GOOD. THAT'S WHEN IT ALL COMES BACK. I'VE GOT TO SAY CONGRATS ON, YOU WON YOUR FIRST NAACP AWARD.
YEAH, I WAS ORIGINALLY KNOWN AS THE SUSAN LUCCI OF THE NAACP'S. TEN NOMINATIONS.
Jimmy: TEN NOMMIES.
FINALLY GOT ONE.
Jimmy: YOU DID, YOU GOT ONE. YOU DESERVED IT.
I THOUGHT I DESERVED IT TOO, BUT I'M NOT SURE IF I ACTUALLY WON, BECAUSE TRACEE ELLIS ROSS ANNOUNCED THAT CATEGORY, I TOLD HER, NO MATTER WHOSE NAME IS ON THE ENVELOPE, SAY MY NAME WHEN SHE OPENS IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR, MAN.
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE DID. THE ENVELOPE WAS RIPPED UP. SO, I DON'T KNOW WHO ACTUALLY WON.
Jimmy: BUT YOU HAVE THE AWARD.
I HAVE THE AWARD AT HOME ON MY MANTLE.
Jimmy: SO THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. YOU HAVE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU, TRACEE. THANK YOU, TRACEE. I LOVE YOU.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, VERY GOOD. GOOD MOVE.
Jimmy: I THOUGHT IT WAS SWEET, YOU BROUGHT YOUR MOM, WHO I'VE HEARD THOUSANDS OF STORIES ABOUT YOUR MOM. I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR MOM. YOU BROUGHT YOUR MOM TO THE AWARDS SHOW?
I DID.
Jimmy: WHICH IS SO COOL.
SHE WAS MY DATE. SHE WAS MY DATE.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD.
ALL SHE WANTED FOR A YEAR, ALL SHE'S BEEN TELLING ME IS "BABY, I WANT TO MEET OPRAH. BABY, I WANT TO MEET OPRAH. BABY, I WANT TO MEET OPRAH."
Jimmy: YOU GO, "MOM, I WANT TO MEET OPRAH." YEAH, EVERYONE DOES.
SO, YOU KNOW, OPRAH WAS AT THE SHOW, SO I SCREAMED INTO THE AUDIENCE. I SAID, "MAMA RAISE YOUR HAND." MY MAMA RAISED HER HAND. I SAID, "OPRAH, THAT'S MY MAMA. MAMA, THAT'S OPRAH. OPRAH TAKE A PICTURE WITH MY MAMA." SO I BROUGHT HER BACKSTAGE. YOU GOT THAT? THEY GOT MY BABY.
Jimmy: THERE'S DORIS. [ APPLAUSE ]
THERE GO MY BABY RIGHT THERE.
Jimmy: THAT'S COOL MAN. THAT'S AWESOME, BUDDY. CONGRATS ON THE SHOW. I'VE GOT TO THE SHOW IS FUNNY. IT'S POIGNANT, IT'S WELL WRITTEN. AND THIS IS BASED ON HALF YOUR LIFE?
HALF MY LIFE, PART OF MY LIFE, AND THE CREATOR OF THE SHOW, KENYA BARRIS, WHO'S MY PARTNER IN ALL OF THIS, BOTH OF OUR FAMILIES, YEAH.
Jimmy: GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOUR LIFE COULD BE WRITTEN INTO THIS?
IN THE PILOT EPISODE, MY SON CAME HOME AND SAID HE WANTED TO HAVE A BAR MITZVAH. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE.
Jimmy: I REMEMBER THAT.
YOU REMEMBER THAT.
Jimmy: HE WANTED TO HAVE A A BAR MITZVAH.
SO I THREW HIM A BRO MITZVAH. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO, THAT'S PART OF THE SHOW. YOU KNOW, THINGS LIKE THAT. DO ANY OF THE STORIES EVER BOTHER YOUR KIDS IN REAL LIFE? DO THEY GO, DAD, "THAT'S TOO CLOSE TO THE BONE, MAN?"
NO, BUT YOU KNOW, THEY KNOW THE SHOW, MY SON'S FRIENDS AND ALL OF THEM KNOW THE SHOW IS LOOSELY BASED ON WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH.
Jimmy: IT'S A HIT MAN. IT'S A GIANT HIT, EVERYONE KNOWS THE SHOW NOW.
YEAH, SO THERE WAS AN EPISODE CALLED "THE SEX TALK" WHERE I WALK AROUND THE HOUSE WITH NO SHIRT ON TALKING ABOUT SEX WITH MY SON BECAUSE HIS MOTHER WALKED IN ON HIM MASTURBATING. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO MY SON IN REAL LIFE.
Jimmy: NO.
NO, IT HAPPENED TO ME IN MY CHILDHOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT EITHER WAY HIS FRIENDS DON'T KNOW THAT?
YEAH, BUT NOW THEY DO. BUT, THEY GIVE MY BROTHER -- THEY GIVE MY SON, THEY JOKE ABOUT MY SON LIKE "DAMN, DID YOUR DADDY REALLY DO THAT?" AND HE'S LIKE, "NO, NOT EVERYTHING IS BASED ON ME." SO TO ALL MY SON'S FRIENDS, IT WAS MY MOMMA WHO WALKED IN ON ME AS I WAS ON HER SIDE OF THE BED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. WAIT. ♪♪ YOU GUYS, ANTHONY ANDERSON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "BLACK-ISH" AIRS WEDNESDAY AT 9:30 P.M. ON ABC. MARK RONSON PERFORMS FOR US AFTER THE BREAK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
