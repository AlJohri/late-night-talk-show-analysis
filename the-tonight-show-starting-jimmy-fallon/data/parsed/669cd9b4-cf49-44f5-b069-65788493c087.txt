[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. SOME NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON. THE PENTAGON JUST ANNOUNCED THAT ITS FIGHT AGAINST ISIS WILL BE CALLED "OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE." YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY CAME UP WITH THE NAME USING "OPERATION RANDOM THESAURUS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE" IS THE NAME FOR ITS FIGHT AGAINST ISIS. UNFORTUNATE TWO TERRORISTS GOT AWAY WHILE THEY WERE THINK BUSY THINKING OF THAT NAME. [ LAUGHTER ] CALL IT WHATEVER, DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. "OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE." OF COURSE, SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT GIVEN HOW DANGEROUS THE MISSION IS, THE NAME DOESN'T SOUND AS INTIMIDATING AS IT SHOULD, BUT WE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET OUR HANDS ON A COUPLE OF OTHER NAMES THAT THEY WERE -- IN THE RUNNING.
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK THEY WERE THAT MUCH BETTER. TAKE A LOOK. THERE WAS "OPERATION FORCEFUL TALKING TO."
Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]

WHEN THEY HEARD THE NAME "NO SURRENDER" THE PENTAGON WAS LIKE, "DAMN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PERFECT NAME WOULDN'T IT?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "NO SURRENDER" IS COOL, IT'S EDGY, IT'S -- [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, THIS WHOLE EBOLA SCARE STILL HAS EVERYONE ON EDGE.

Steve: WAIT, WHAT? WHAT?
Jimmy: SO, IN SIMPLER TERMS, DON'T WORRY, BUT YOU KNOW, WORRY.

I THINK IT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT THING I HAVE EVER TACKLED.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YOU KNOW, TELLING A STORY WITH SONGS AND TELLING A KIND OF COMPLEX STORY, BUT IT'S A A STORY ABOUT MY COMMUNITY. I WAS BROUGHT UP IN A SHIPYARD TOWN IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND, AND THIS IS A JOYOUS CELEBRATION OF THAT COMMUNITY. THEY BUILT THE BIGGEST SHIPS IN THE WORLD.

THAT'S THE STREET I WAS BROUGHT UP IN. THAT ISN'T THE COLLAGE, THAT'S AN ACTUAL SHIP AT THE END OF MY STREET.

Jimmy: OH, NO. NO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOT GONNA WORK OUT FOR YOU. YOU DON'T MAKE MONEY DOING THAT. YOU GOT TO MAKE SHIPS. I DROPPED THIS ONE. THIS IS GIGANTIC. WERE THEY WARSHIPS OR CRUISE SHIPS?
THEY BUILT WAR SHIPS. THEY BUILT SUPER TANKERS. THEY BUILT CRUISE LINERS.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH. AND YOU WOULD JUST SEE IT GET BUILT AND THEN LAUNCHED.

Jimmy: REALLY?
TOTALLY NOT --
Jimmy: TRY AGAIN, TO STING? NO, HE DOESN'T TRY AGAIN. YOU TRY AGAIN. THINK OF A DIFFERENT ANSWER.
SO I WENT BACK HOME AND I, YOU KNOW, IT WAS GOOD FOR ME. BUT I FELT IN SAFE HANDS THAT THEY WERE CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO TELL ME THAT I HAD TO DO BETTER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO, IT WAS FIVE YEARS OF THAT.
Jimmy: GOSH, DID YOU LIKE MUSICALS GROWING UP?

WELL, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES. NOT AS MUCH AS I'M SURE STING PROBABLY. BUT HE PROBABLY GOES UP TO MOST PEOPLE AND SAYS I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO, BUT I AM STING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IN MY LIFE -- SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS, SOMETIMES UNEXPECTEDLY, LIKE -- BUT IT'S ALWAYS GOT A LITTLE -- I WAS JOGGING, THIS IS YEARS AGO, CLEARLY, AND I HAD DECIDED I'M GOING GO JOGGING. I'M GONNA START GET, IN SHAPE. TO QUOTE ALBERT BROOKS, I'M GONNA START A NEW LIFE AND I'D LIKE RUNNING IT TO BE A MAJOR PART OF IT.
Jimmy: WAS THIS RECENTLY?
THIS WAS A FEW YEARS AGO, AND I WAS JOGGING, AND I WAS GOING BACK TO MY APARTMENT, AND THIS MAN CAME OUT OF, LIKE, BEHIND A TREE OR SOMETHING. AND HE WAS HOLDING SOME PARAPHERNALIA. HE SEEMED SWEET. AGGRESSIVE BUT SWEET. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, IT'S GOOD HE SEE YOU, MAN. HOW ARE YOU? I WAS LIKE, I'M GOOD. HE SAID I'M A BIG FAN. I -- ARE YOU STILL MAKING MUSIC? YEAH, YOU KNOW, I TRY TO MAKE MUSIC EVERY DAY, YOU KNOW. WELL, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME, BUT YEAH, I DON'T SEE YOU RUNNING THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I THOUGHT, RUNNING THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD? THAT'S -- HMM. WELL, YEAH, I DON'T RUN AS MUCH AS I -- I TRY TO GOING ALONG WITH IT. TRYING TO NOT TO MAKE HIM FEEL BAD, HE KNEW WHERE I LIVED. YOU DON'T WANT TO UPSET SOMEONE IF THEY KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S A GOOD LESSON.
SO BASICALLY HE WAS LIKE, WOULD YOU MIND SIGNING SOME STUFF? I SAID NOT A PROBLEM. AND HE HANDED ME ALL THIS STUFF, THIS PARAPHERNALIA AND I REALIZED IT WAS ALL RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS STUFF. IT WAS -- [ LAUGHTER ] BLOOD SEX SUGAR MAGIC POSTER, CALIFORNICATION VINYL, LIMITED EDITION VINYL. AND IT HAD EVERYBODY'S SIGNATURE IN THE BAND. EVERY GUITAR PLAYER THAT'S EVER BEEN IN THE CHILI PEPPERS HAS SIGNED THIS STUFF. I GOT FLEA, I GOT CHAD, I JUST DON'T HAVE YOU, ANTHONY. AND I BASICALLY, NO OFFENSE, BUT LIKE I WAS SO DEEP INTO THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE MAN, IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING TO THE BOTH OF US IF I SAID I'M NOT ANTHONY KIEDIS. SO, TO MAKE HIM FEEL OKAY, I BECAME ANTHONY KIEDIS.
Jimmy: NO! NO! ♪♪
I DID. I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM, BUT I WAS LIKE, IF YOU GOT A PEN, I CAN SIGN IT AND I -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE WAS LIKE, THANK YOU SO MUCH ANTHONY. I WAS LIKE, IT'S -- LET ME JUST -- LET ME JUST SIGN IT UP. AND HE IS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TALKING LIKE ANTHONY KIEDIS.
AND HOW'S FLEA? HE IS PRETTY GOOD, JUST PLAYING THE BASS AND JUST WRITING A NEW RECORD ALL OVER THE PLACE.
Jimmy: RHYMING WORDS.
TEN MINUTES, I SIGNED ALL THAT STUFF, AND AS A FRIEND LATER TOLD ME, HE PROBABLY SOLD THIS STUFF, SO THERE ARE SOME KIEDIS. AND I SIGNED IT AS ANTHONY KIEDIS, AND I HAD TO DO IT AS ANTHONY, WHICH IS A A DIFFERENT -- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SPELL THE LAST NAME EXACTLY. I WASN'T SURE WITH THE I.
Jimmy: THE I-E. BUT EITHER WAY, CLOSE ENOUGH.
I COMES BEFORE E EXCEPT IN KIEDIS.
Jimmy: EXCEPT IN KIEDIS. EXACTLY.
BUT IT WAS A REAL -- IT WAS A FUN DAY. SO I DO GET APPROACHED SOMETIMES, BUT IT'S NOT GENERALLY FOR WHO I AM. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S FUNNY THAT I WILL BE MISTAKEN FOR ANTHONY KIEDIS BECAUSE, A, I WAS WEARING A A SHIRT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND -- BECAUSE ANTHONY KIEDIS AND ME, LIKE, THE ONLY TIME I TAKE OFF MY SHIRT IS TO GET IN THE SHOWER, THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY TIME HE WEARS A SHIRT. THAT GUY HAS HIS SHIRT OFF ALL THE TIME.
Jimmy: NO, YEAH. AND HE CAN. HE'S IN UNBELIEVABLE SHAPE. YEAH.
I GUESS HE IS.
Jimmy: BUT THE GOOD --
IT IS GOOD TO BE MISTAKEN FOR HIM WITH THE BODY.
Jimmy: IT'S FANTASTIC BEING MISTAKEN FOR ANTHONY KIEDIS.
YOU EVER MET HIM?
Jimmy: YEAH, I MET ANTHONY KIEDIS ONCE. IT WAS AT A CLUB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE WERE SITTING, ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE SITTING HERE, YOU'RE ANTHONY KIEDIS. A FRIEND WAS HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS A VERY DARK PLACE. DARK BAR, RESTAURANT/BAR. [ APPLAUSE ] I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT. HE LEVITATED OUT OF HIS BOOTH. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT.
HE WAS LIKE, I'M A BIG FAN.
Jimmy: I'M BIG A FAN. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT. YEAH. BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FILM HERE, "LISTEN UP, PHILLIP."
YES.
Jimmy: GOSH, I LOVED IT. I WANT PEOPLE TO SEE THIS MOVIE AND I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE REAL -- YOU'RE ACTING, YOU'RE AN ACTOR. BECAUSE YOU'RE SO CONVINCING AND FUNNY. AND HE IS A REAL, LIKE, MEAN GUY BUT HE IS SHARP AND HE IS SO FUNNY AND JUST KNOW THAT'S NOT YOU.
NO.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A VERY NICE GUY. AND THAT'S WHAT ACTORS DO.
WELL, I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YES. I MEAN, I -- THIS IS -- I PLAY AN ASS [ BLEEP ].
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
HE'S A YOUNG WRITER, HE'S SUCCESSFUL AND HE BASICALLY MISHANDLES EVERY SITUATION IN HIS LIFE. BUT I'M SAYING THIS GUY IS SO EXTREMELY RELENTLESS WITH HOW NEGATIVE HE CAN BE THAT IT'S QUITE FUNNY, I THINK. BASICALLY, HE EJECTS HIMSELF FROM HIS LIFE. HE GETS INVITED TO GO TO HIS MENTOR'S HOUSE, PLAYED BY JONATHAN PRICE, WHO IS ALSO A A WRITER. AND HE IS TYPICALLY A MENTOR. TEACHES A YOUNGER GUY ALL THE GOOD THINGS, BUT THIS GUY'S MISERABLE. AND THE TWO OF US HAVE A A MISERABLE RELATIONSHIP TOGETHER AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER. AND I'M MEAN TO MY GIRLFRIEND, I'M MEAN TO HIM, I'M MEAN TO MYSELF AND IT'S A REALLY FUNNY MOVIE. IT'S -- FEEL-BAD MOVIE OF THE YEAR.
Jimmy: THE FEEL-BAD MOVIE OF THE YEAR.
I REALLY DO SEE IT. IT'S GOOD.
Jimmy: IT'S WELL SHOT. I HAVE RARELY SEEN A FILM LIKE THAT. WHO DIRECTED IT?
ALEX ROSS PERRY DIRECTED IT, SEAN PRICE WILLIAMS SHOT IT AND WE MADE IT HERE IN NEW YORK FOR A FEW WEEKS LAST YEAR. I'M REALLY PROUD OF IT BECAUSE, IT'S -- YEAH I THINK YOU'LL REALLY ENJOY IT.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW --
PLAYING HERE, JUST OPENS TOMORROW.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW A A SCENE HERE. YOU DO A SCENE, YOU'RE IN A A DINER. GOING TO MEET THIS GIRL AND YOU JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU'RE JUST GETTING IN A BAD MOOD. YOU WERE GOING IN THINKING IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
THIS IS -- I HAVE MY NEW BOOK COMING OUT SO I GO TO MEET MY EX-GIRLFRIEND TO GIVE HER A A SIGNED COPY OF IT. BUT BECAUSE SHE'S LATE THIS CHARACTER, HE IS DISAPPOINTED EASILY, AND IF YOU DISAPPOINT HIM, IT'S OVER.
Jimmy: YOU GOT TO SEE THIS. IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD. HERE IS JASON SCHWARTZMAN IN "LISTEN UP, PHILLIP."
THIS IS CRAZY THAT YOU'RE LATE, SWEETIE.
PLEASE STOP TALKING. 25 MINUTES I'M WAITING, ALMOST 30, IT'S AN INSULT. ALSO, I HAVE A REALLY BUSY DAY, SO NOW I HAVE LESS THAN AN HOUR. PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TO EAT ANYTHING.
MAYBE A GRILLED CHEESE FOR ME.
I HAD IT THE OTHER DAY, IT'S DISGUSTING. SO I SHOULD ASK YOU HOW YOU ARE, RIGHT? THINGS ARE GOOD?
THINGS ARE GOOD WITH ME. ELLIE AND I JUST FINALLY FOUND A NEW ROOMMATE.
OH, WHAT'S HER ASS MOVED?
SHE GOT MARRIED SIX YEARS AGO.
FIGURES.
IS THAT THE NEW BOOK?
YEAH. WASN'T SURE YOU HAD NOTICED OR HEARD. I'M JUST GETTING READY. THINGS ARE GONNA BE PRETTY CRAZY FOR ME AFTER THE RELEASE. IN FACT, THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST TIME I'M HOME FOR THAN A WEEK AT A TIME FOR THE NEXT EIGHT OR POSSIBLY NINE MONTHS. DEFINITELY, JUST BUSY. LOS ANGELES IN JANUARY.
