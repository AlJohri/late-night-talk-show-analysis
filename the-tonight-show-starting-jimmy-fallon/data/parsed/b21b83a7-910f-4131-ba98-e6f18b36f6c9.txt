Steve: AND NOW, HERE'S YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT A CROWD. THIS IS GREAT. GOOD LOOKING CROWD. GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. YOU'RE HERE. THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE READY. READY FOR OUR FUN SHOW.
WE LOVE YOU, JIMMY.
Jimmy: I LOVE YOU TOO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HERE IS WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THIS WEEK. AND GET THIS, ACCORDING TO A A NEW ANALYSIS, TRUMP'S SPEECH ON TUESDAY WAS ACTUALLY WRITTEN AT A SEVENTH GRADE LEVEL. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH I GUESS EXPLAINS HIS 20 MINUTE RANT ON WHY HOMEWORK SUCKS. [ LAUGHTER ] IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP CALLED JEB BUSH A A RELUCTANT WARRIOR AND SAID HE THINKS JEB IS AN UNHAPPY PERSON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS INTERESTING COMING FROM A GUY WHO ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE HE JUST ATE A LEMON. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, THIS WASN'T GOOD HERE. RED SOX THIRD BASEMAN, PABLO SANDOVAL, WAS FORCED TO SIT OUT LAST NIGHT AFTER HE WAS CAUGHT LIKING PICTURES OF WOMEN ON INSTAGRAM DURING THE GAME. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, THE TEAM ACTUALLY BENCHED HIM. EVEN WORSE, WHEN HE GOT HOME HIS GIRLFRIEND COUCHED HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING HERE, BUDDY. YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF SPORTS, GOLF'S U.S. OPEN STARTED YESTERDAY, AND SINCE THE TOURNAMENT IS IN WASHINGTON STATE THIS YEAR, THERE'S SOME PRETTY UNUSUAL RULES FOR WHAT PEOPLE CAN BRING ON TO THE GOLF COURSE. THIS IS REAL. CHECK THIS OUT.
HERE'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT CAN MAKE YOU GO HMM. YOU CAN BRING WEED INTO THE U.S. OPEN, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GOLF TOURNAMENT, BUT NOT BOTTLED WATER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT MAKES SENSE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WEED IS LEGAL. WHEN STONERS GET THERE, THEY'RE LIKE, "THIS PUTT PUTT COURSE IS HUGE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO NEED A BIGGER PUTTER." YOU'LL KNOW WEED IS ALLOWED WHEN A GOLFER YELLS, "FORE!" AND SOMEBODY ELSE YELLS, "20!" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ OF COURSE ALL THE EYES ARE ON TIGER WOODS, WHO'S LOOKING TO FINALLY GET BACK TO HIS OLD WINNING WAYS. LET'S CHECK IN ON HOW THAT'S GOING.
AND THEN HE WENT TO NUMBER EIGHT AND FOUND THE ROUGH TO THE RIGHT OFF OF THE TEE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EVEN CHARLES BARKLEY WAS LIKE, "THAT'S TERRIBLE." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, HE LET GO OF THE CLUB. YOU KNOW, WE MENTIONED WEED BEING LEGAL IN WASHINGTON STATE EARLIER. WELL GET THIS, YESTERDAY, DELAWARE BECAME THE 20th STATE TO DECRIMINALIZE THE POSSESSION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIJUANA. BUT, THIS IS INTERESTING. NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT TEENAGERS DON'T SMOKE MORE POT WHEN MARIJUANA BECOMES LEGAL. IN FACT, IT LOOKS LIKE TEENS ARE ACTUALLY SMOKING LESS POT THAN EVER BEFORE ACCORDING TO THIS NEW STUDY. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PIE CHART. WHEN ASKED DO YOU SMOKE MARIJUANA -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- 18% OF TEENS SAID, "UHH, NO." [ LAUGHTER ] 20% OF TEENS SAID, "I CAN SAY NO, RIGHT? OKAY THEN, NO." [ LAUGHTER ] 26% OF TEENS SAID, "ALL OF THE TIME. WAIT, WILL MY NAME BE ON THIS BECAUSE I MEANT TO SAY, NO I'M ACTUALLY ALLERGIC TO MARIJUANA." [ LAUGHTER ] 31% OF TEENS SAID, "WHAT'S MARIJUANA? I DEFINITELY SMOKE A LOT OF WEED. OH, MARIJUANA IS WEED. THEN, NO, I DON'T SMOKE EITHER." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY 100% OF THEM SAID, "YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT PIE. WHEN DO WE GET TO EAT PIE?" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PIE CHART. IT'S A PIE CHART. IT'S A DIFFERENT THING. WHO DOESN'T LOVE PIE? I SAW THAT THIS WEEKEND, PEOPLE IN JAPAN CAN START PURCHASING PEPPER, WHICH IS A FOUR FOOT TALL ROBOT THAT CAN KEEP YOU COMPANY AND GUESS YOUR MOOD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THOUGH, IF YOU JUST BOUGHT A A ROBOT TO KEEP YOU COMPANY, HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO GUESS YOUR MOOD? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M DETECTING SADNESS. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, I'M LONELY, YEAH. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT AMAZON MAY BE ABLE TO LAUNCH ITS DRONE DELIVERY PROGRAM WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR. SO, IF YOU HEAR YOUR DOORBELL, AND YOU SEE A ROBOT HOVERING NEAR YOUR HOUSE, IT COULD BE THE END OF THE WORLD OR THE 12 PACK OF BRITA FILTERS YOU ORDERED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, OF COURSE, FATHER'S DAY IS THIS WEEKEND AND HAPPY FATHER'S DAY TO ALL OF THE DADS OUT THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND TO MY DAD, HAPPY FATHER'S DAY. HAPPY FATHER'S DAY.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT IS SO GREAT TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.
IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE.
Jimmy: AND HAPPY EARLY FATHER'S DAY TO YOU.
IT'S GOING TO BE FATHER'S DAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HOW WEIRD IS THAT? RIGHT? THAT IS A WEIRD HOLIDAY, RIGHT? I MEAN MOTHER'S DAY I GET. THE MOTHERS GIVE BIRTH TO US, BUT FATHER'S DAY, YOU KNOW THE GUY'S HAVING A LOT MORE FUN, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? FATHER'S DAY IS KIND OF LIKE CELEBRATING DARTH VADER'S BIRTHDAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S WEIRD AND I HAVE A LOT OF KIDS, JIMMY. AND I SAY A LOT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE REAL NUMBER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY'RE ALWAYS MOVING. I HAVE AN 11 YEAR OLD, NINE YEAR OLD, SIX, FOUR, TWO AND I WILL START THE BIDDING AT $50. THERE IS -- FATHER'S DAY IS WEIRD, RIGHT? YOU'RE A DAD, IT'S NICE, BUT IT FEELS LIKE A HOLIDAY THAT IS KIND OF AN AFTER THOUGHT. LIKE, YOU KNOW, MOTHER'S DAY, ALL RIGHT, I GUESS WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING THAT FOR THAT GUY THAT ON HIS ONE DAY OFF GOES GOLFING. MAYBE WE'LL HAVE A BARBECUE FOR HIM. IT'S WEIRD. EVEN THE GIFTS, RIGHT? A TIE. WE GIVE DADS TIES, IS THIS 1950? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S JUST A SILK NOOSE, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DIDN'T LOOK AT IT THAT WAY. I DIDN'T THINK OF IT THAT WAY.
IT'S WEIRD, LIKE MY KIDS, LAST YEAR MY KIDS GAVE ME A A BOOK. AND YOU KNOW, WHO DOESN'T WANT A BOOK THAT AN EIGHT YEAR OLD PICKED OUT, RIGHT? BY THE WAY I WOULD NOT MIND THIS BOOK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, I HAVE THIS BOOK. BY THE WAY, JIMMY, I HAVE ONE QUESTION. WHAT TOOK LONGER TO READ THIS OR TO WRITE THIS? [ LAUGHTER ] WERE YOU ON THE TOILET WHEN YOU WROTE THIS? [ LAUGHTER ] DADA. IT'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: DON'T SPOIL THE END. DON'T SPOIL THE END.
I DON'T WANNA GIVE IT AWAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DON'T GIVE IT AWAY. IT'S A GOOD TWIST.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I LOVE THE IDEA BEHIND THIS BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, THERE IS THIS INTEREST IN YOUR KID SAYING DADA FIRST. AND I WOULD SAY THAT I LOST AT WHOLESALE WITH ALL OF MY KIDS. BUT MY FOUR YEAR OLD DID HAVE A A STRANGE ATTACHMENT TO ME. LIKE, HE WOULD WANT TO COME TO ME RATHER THAN HIS MOM. AND I WAS FLATTERED, BUT I ALSO WAS LIKE CONCERNED FOR HIS JUDGMENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SOMETHING IS WRONG.
HE IS NOT THE BRIGHTEST ONE.
Jimmy: HE'S NOT THE BRIGHTEST ONE. NO, HE'S NOT. ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING FOR THE SUMMER? ANY SUMMER PLANS?
WELL IT MAY COME AS NO SURPRISE. I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF SUMMER. [ LAUGHTER ] I LIKE JACKET WEATHER. I LIKE A PLACE TO PUT THE KEYS AND HIDE THE FACT THAT I HAVEN'T WORKED OUT IN TWO DECADES. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S JUST WEIRD. YOU KNOW ALL MY KIDS, THEY HAVE SUMMER VACATION. AND, HEY, WHO DOESN'T DESERVE THREE MONTHS OFF, AFTER THE RIGORS OF KINDERGARTEN? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU KNOW, SUMMER IS -- AND WE LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY. IT'S LIKE PEOPLE FORGET. THEY'RE EXCITED FOR SUMMER. BUT AUGUST, IN NEW YORK CITY, IT IS LIKE WALKING THROUGH URINE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S HORRIBLE. BUT, YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THINK IT IS FUNNY HOW EVERYONE, THERE'S PRESSURE TO GO OUTSIDE. THERE'S PRESSURE TO TRAVEL, PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "WHERE ARE YOU GOING THIS SUMMER?" I'M LIKE, "WHY DO I HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE?" IT'S LIKE, "WELL, YOU WERE HERE DURING THE HORRIBLE WEATHER AND NOW THAT IT'S NICE, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE."
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.
