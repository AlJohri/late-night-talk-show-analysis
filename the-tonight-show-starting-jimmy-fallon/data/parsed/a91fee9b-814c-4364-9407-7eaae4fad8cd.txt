Jimmy: AFTER ANOTHER TEQUILA, HE PROBABLY WOULD FALL DOWN, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY GOT TO BE PROUD OF YOU THOUGH. OH, MY GOSH. YOU GOT NOMINATED FOR A GOLDEN GLOBE. THAT'S GREAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WELL DESERVED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WELL DESERVED.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: DO THEY SEE YOU ALL OVER THE PRESS AND ON THE RED CARPET AND MAGAZINES AND --
YEAH, THEY DO. THEY DO. BUT THE OTHER DAY MY DAD SAID, "SO, I SAW YOU IN BG MAGAZINE." I SAID, "B-G?" MY BROTHER'S IN THE BACKGROUND, "'GQ' DADDY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DUDE, I WANT TO MEET YOUR DAD NEXT TIME YOU'RE HERE.
WE CAN ARRANGE THAT.
Jimmy: WE CAN DO THAT, YEAH. OPRAH'S RAVED ABOUT YOU. THIS IS YOUR SECOND TIME WORKING WITH OPRAH.
YES.
Jimmy: YOU WORKED WITH HER IN "THE BUTLER" AS WELL.
THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.
Jimmy: IN "THE BUTLER," YOU SAID SHE HAD TO SLAP YOU.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SHE DID. UNFORTUNATELY, OPRAH DOES FILMS SO RARELY. SHE GETS A LITTLE BIT RUSTY BETWEEN FILMS. SO, WE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DID SHE CLOCK YOU GOOD?
WELL, SHE LITERALLY SAID, "SO, WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS SCENE. WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO HIT YOU?" "WH -- WHAT? YOU MEAN FOR REAL?" "YEAH, YEAH." "NO, WE'RE GOING TO DO SEVERAL TAKES OF THIS, SO I'D RATHER YOU MISS." AND SHE'S LIKE, "OH, OH, OKAY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE, "I'M GOING TO HIT YOU IN THE FACE!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND I'M GOING TO PUNCH YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET PUNCHED AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET PUNCHED AND YOU'RE GETTING PUNCHED! [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SHE RAVED ABOUT YOU. GOSH, ARE YOU GREAT IN THIS. I MEAN, OH, MY GOSH. "SELMA." YOU'RE PLAYING DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.
YES.
Jimmy: DID YOU EVER EVEN THINK THAT YOU COULD EVEN LOOK LIKE HIM? YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE HIM.
WELL, NO, I DIDN'T, ACTUALLY. BUT APPARENTLY, ME PLUS 30 POUNDS, HAVING ATE A LOT OF PASTA, EQUALS LOOKING LIKE DR. KING.
Jimmy: YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. AND YOU WATCH THIS FILM AND THERE'S A -- IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, GO CHECK THIS OUT. BUT IT'S THE MARCH FROM SELMA TO --
MONTGOMERY.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND YOU JUST SEE -- I WAS SAYING TO OPRAH TOO -- HOW MUCH WORK GOES INTO A PROTEST. BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU JUST SEE A PROTEST ON THE NEWS OR YOU SEE IT AND YOU GO, "OH, YEAH." BUT, IT'S NOT EASY.
NO.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO ORGANIZE AND YOU HAVE TO SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE AND WHAT EVERYONE IS GOING TO SAY AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO -- YOU KNOW, IT'S A TRICKY THING AND OBVIOUSLY WITH THIS, IT'S A A POIGNANT TIME RIGHT NOW.
YEAH, YEAH. AND THAT'S THE THING I LOVE THAT WE DO WITH THE FILM. IT'S NOT JUST ORGANIZING, BUT STRATEGY. THAT'S WHAT KING WAS SO BRILLIANT AT WAS, YOU KNOW, BEING ABLE TO ARTICULATE TO THE PRESIDENT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. HE WAS A VOICE FOR THE VOICELESS. AND THAT WAS, I GUESS, A REAL PRIVILEGE TO SHOW THE HUMAN BEING BEHIND THAT INCREDIBLE ABILITY, REALLY.
Jimmy: WHAT A PERFORMANCE. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYBODY A CLIP HERE. HERE'S DAVID OYELOWO IN "SELMA." TAKE A LOOK.
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T WANT US TO MARCH TODAY. [ CHEERS ] THE COURTS DON'T WANT US TO MARCH, BUT WE MUST MARCH. WE MUST STAND UP. WE MUST MAKE A MASSIVE DEMONSTRATION OF OUR MODEL CERTAINTY.
