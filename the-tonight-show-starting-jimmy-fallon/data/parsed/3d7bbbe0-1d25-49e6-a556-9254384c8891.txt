YEAH. I'VE GOT THREE DAUGHTERS. THEY ALL HAVE THEIR -- ONE TURNED THREE, SIX AND 16, ALL LAST MONTH.
Jimmy: GOD, SO YOU HAD TO THROW THREE PARTIES?
ACTUALLY, I HAD TO THROW FOUR PARTIES BECAUSE THE SIX-YEAR-OLD DEMANDED TWO. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE SHE WANTED THE ONE WITH HER FRIENDS WHILE THEY WERE STILL IN SCHOOL, AND THEN BY THE TIME -- AND THAT HAPPENED IN JUNE. SO, BY THE TIME HER REAL BIRTHDAY ROLLED AROUND, SHE'D FORGOTTEN THAT SHE ALL READY HAD A PARTY. SHE WAS LIKE, "AREN'T WE DOING ANYTHING FOR MY BIRTHDAY?" WE SAID, "WE HAD A PARTY." SHE DIDN'T REMEMBER. WE HAD TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND THREE-YEAR-OLD PARTY, THAT'S FUN.
YEAH. WELL, LIFE'S A PARTY WHEN YOU'RE THREE.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, EVERYTHING, YEAH.
A CUPCAKE AND A LITTLE FIZZY, YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: AND SHE'S HAPPY, YEAH. AND THE 16-YEAR-OLD PARTY?
THE 16-YEAR-OLD, A PARTY TO HER IS ANY TIME I'M NOT AROUND.
Jimmy: OH YEAH. SO YOU DON'T GO TO THAT ONE.
IT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN MUCH FOR ME. FOR HER, IT WAS A BIG DEAL.
Jimmy: EVERY TIME YOU'RE ON HERE, YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE THAT JUST BLOWS MY MIND. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU. I HATE TO GUSH. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT LOOKING AT YOU.
I WON'T LOOK AT YOU EITHER.
Jimmy: BUT, "BOYHOOD." MAN, OH MAN, WHAT A -- QUEST, YOU JUST SAW THAT, RIGHT?
Questlove: YEAH.
Jimmy: IT IS UNBELIEVABLY GREAT. IT TOOK 12 YEARS TO MAKE THIS MOVIE. EVERY YEAR YOU WOULD SHOOT FOR A WEEK.
YEAH, THREE OR FOUR DAYS.
Jimmy: AND THEN YOU NEVER TOLD ANYONE. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME. I'M ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS.
NO, I TOLD EVERYBODY. NOBODY CARED. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, IT'S TRUE. YOU TELL SOMEBODY, "HEY, I JUST GOT BACK FROM TEXAS. I WAS SHOOTING A MOVIE WITH RICHARD LINKLATER." "OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" "OH IT'S THIS THING CALLED 'BOYHOOD.'" "WHEN IS IT GOING TO COME OUT?" "NINE YEARS." AND THEY KIND OF GO, "OH, COOL, YEAH." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY -- I TRIED TO TELL EVERYONE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN, IT'S JUST NOW STARTING TO DAWN ON PEOPLE WHAT IT WAS WE WERE WORKING ON.
Jimmy: IT'S AN AMAZING -- YOU REALIZE NO ONE CAN EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS MOVIE BECAUSE THIS IS DONE. YOU'VE DONE IT.
IT'S ORIGINAL. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY, I THINK.
Jimmy: PROBABLY EVERY DIRECTOR -- [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU. THAT'S WHY I GET PAID THE BIG BUCKS TO HOST. YEAH, THANK YOU. BUT EVERY DIRECTOR PROBABLY THOUGHT OF THIS IDEA, AND SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I WISH THAT I SHOT SOMETHING EVERY YEAR FOR 12 YEARS." I MEAN, THE CAST -- THIS BOY --
ELLAR COLTRANE.
Jimmy: ELLAR COLTRANE.
HE'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: STARTS SIX-YEAR-OLD AND GOES TO 18.
WE GOT LUCK IN SO MANY WAYS MAKING THIS. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, YOU CAN'T SIGN A CONTRACT FOR 12 YEARS. THE WHOLE THING WAS --
Jimmy: I WAS GOING TO SAY, HOW DID YOU NEGOTIATE -- HOW DID YOU PULL THIS OFF?
WE CAST A SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY. MY FIRST SCENE WITH HIM, I'VE GOT TO HELP HIM GET IN HIS CAR SEAT. AND AT THE END OF THE MOVIE, HE'S LIKE JAMES DEAN, SMOKING A A CIGARETTE.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, TOTALLY.
YOU KNOW, HE'S SO COOL THIS KID. WE GOT SO LUCKY.
Jimmy: YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GREW UP WITH THIS KID. YOU WATCHED HIM GROW UP.
YOU FEEL THAT WAY. I ACTUALLY DID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU ACTUALLY DID.
I MEAN, I GOT TO PRETEND TO BE HIS DAD FOR 12 YEARS. AND THE TRUTH IS HIS OWN FAMILY IS WONDERFUL. AND HE'S THIS REALLY -- WE GOT REALLY LUCKY WITH THIS MOVIE. BUT THE BIGGEST WAY WE GOT LUCKY WAS WITH ELLAR. JUST THE PERSON THAT HE IS.
Jimmy: HE IS A STUD. AND IT'S GREAT, AND HE SO GOOD.
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANY OF THE BAD STUFF WITH CHILD ACTING GROWING UP. HE DID THIS MOVIE -- HE'S 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. BUT HE NEVER HAD TO HAVE IT COME OUT. SO, HE DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THE MENTAL BREAKDOWN AND THE REHAB. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. WE SHOULD DO THAT WITH ALL OF OUR CHILD STARS. THEY SHOULD HAVE RELEASED "HOME ALONE" 12 YEARS LATER, AND THEN --
COMING SOON, "HOME ALONE."
Jimmy: TRUST ME, IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT, YEAH. BUT IT IS WILD. I'M WATCHING THE MOVIE, AND YOU'RE WATCHING THIS KID. THERE WERE SO MANY CRINGE SCENES WHERE I'M LIKE, "DON'T DO THAT." YOU REMEMBER ALL THE STUPID STUFF YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE A A KID GROWING UP.
YOU FEEL SO LUCKY TO STILL BE ALIVE.
Jimmy: YOU REALLY DO. YOU GO, "MAN, I DID A LOT OF DUMB THINGS GROWING UP."
WELL, YOU PARTICULARLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I REALLY DID. BUT YOU WATCH THIS. THERE ARE SOME SCENES WHERE I'M LIKE, "DON'T DO THAT, DUDE. AW, COME ON, MAN. BE A GOOD BOY. DON'T DO THIS, MAN. DON'T HANG OUT WITH THE CROWD." YOU KNOW? I FEEL LIKE I'M HIS DAD. YOUR ACTING IS PHENOMENAL IN THIS MOVIE. EVERY TIME I SEE YOU I REALIZE I'M SUCH AN AWFUL ACTOR. BECAUSE I COULD NEVER -- YOU'RE DOING A SCENE WHERE YOU'RE WALKING, YOU'RE HIKING WITH YOUR SON IN THE WOODS.
I LOVE THAT SCENE.
Jimmy: IT'S A GREAT SCENE. YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM. AND THEN, AS YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM, YOU GO, "OH, WATCH YOUR STEP" AND YOU GO RIGHT BACK TO SAYING YOUR LINES. AND, SEE, I WOULDN'T DO THAT. I WOULD BE LIKE SO, "LINE, LINE, LINE, LINE, LINE," TRIP OVER THE THING, AND THEN, JUST -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT, NUANCES -- YOU'RE SUCH A COOL DAD IN THIS. AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S A LOT OF REAL LIFE YOU. I THINK YOU'RE A COOL DAD IN REAL LIFE.
WELL, IT WAS SPECIAL FOR -- THE DIRECTOR AND MYSELF, BOTH OUR DADS ARE FROM TEXAS, BOTH OF THEM ARE IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS. BOTH OF THEM HAD US REALLY YOUNG AND WENT THROUGH THE DIFFICULTIES OF HAVING DIVORCE. AND WE BOTH ARE -- WERE YOUNG PARENTS WHEN IT STARTED, AND NOW ARE, YOU KNOW, OLD PARENTS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND IT WAS A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO A A PORTRAIT OF FATHERHOOD. AND TO TRY AND DO THAT IN ALL ITS COMPLEXITIES. AND IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, IT'S REALLY KIND OF SAD TO HAVE IT COME OUT. IT WAS LIKE THIS SPECIAL LITTLE THING THAT WE GOT TO MAKE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND NOW WE HAVE TO SHARE IT WITH THE WORLD. AND THE WORLD FEELS LIKE OF DANGEROUS AND SCARY.
Jimmy: BUT NO, YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO FLIP OUT. AND YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS MOVIE. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S ETHAN HAWKE IN "BOYHOOD." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
TALK TO ME. SAMANTHA, HOW WAS YOUR WEEK? UH, I DON'T KNOW, DAD, IT WAS KIND OF TOUGH. BILLY AND ELLEN BROKE UP, AND ELLEN'S KIND OF MAD AT ME BECAUSE SHE SAW ME TALKING TO BILLY IN THE CAFETERIA. AND YOU REMEMBER THAT SCULPTURE I WAS WORKING ON? WELL, IT WAS A UNICORN AND THE HORN BROKE OFF, SO NOW IT'S A A ZEBRA. OKAY? BUT I STILL THINK I'M GONNA GET AN "A." RIGHT? MASON, HOW WAS YOUR WEEK? WELL, DAD, YOU KNOW IT WAS KIND OF TOUGH. JOEY'S KIND OF JERK, ACTUALLY. HE STOLE SOME CIGARETTES FROM HIS MOM, AND HE WANTED ME TO SMOKE THEM. BUT I SAID NO, BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT A HARD TIME YOU HAD QUITTING SMOKING, DAD. HOW ABOUT THAT? IS THAT SO HARD?
DAD, THESE QUESTIONS ARE KIND OF HARD TO ANSWER.
WHAT IS SO HARD TO ANSWER ABOUT "WHAT SCULPTURE ARE YOU MAKING?"
IT'S ABSTRACT.
OKAY, OKAY. THAT'S GOOD. SEE? THAT'S -- I DIDN'T -- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE EVEN INTERESTED IN ABSTRACT ART.
