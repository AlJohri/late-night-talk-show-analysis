Jimmy: GET THIS, I SAW THAT IN A RECENT INTERVIEW JEB BUSH COMPARED DONALD TRUMP TO THE KARDASHIANS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SAYING, QUOTE, "THE KARDASHIANS WOULDN'T EXIST IF WE DIDN'T ENJOY WATCHING THEM." [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OHS ] WHEN ASKED WHO HIS FAVORITE KARDASHIAN IS, JEB SAID, "ROB, 'CAUSE HE'S THE BROTHER NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OVER ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, JOE BIDEN SAID IN A NEW INTERVIEW THAT HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN BEING VICE PRESIDENT AGAIN. ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S INTERESTED IN THE JOB NOW. I MEAN -- [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK HE SEEMS KIND OF DISTRACTED. CHECK HIM OUT IN THIS MEETING HERE. TAKE LOOK AT THIS.
WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THAT AGENDA. THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, GOD, YOU'VE GOT TO CATCH THEM ALL, BUT I MEAN, STILL.
Steve: RUDE AGAIN.
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, ELIZABETH WARREN HAS BEEN INVITED TO GIVE AN ADDRESS ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. HILLARY CLINTON WILL GIVE THE ADDRESS IN THE FINAL NIGHT, AND BERNIE SANDERS WILL BE GIVEN THE WRONG ADDRESS SO THAT HE MISSES THE CONVENTION ENTIRELY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE GIVING HIM THE WRONG ADDRESS. "THIS IS A CHUCK E. CHEESE! WHAT IS --" [ LAUGHTER ] JUST TALK. SPEAKING OF BERNIE SANDERS, HE ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON YESTERDAY AT A RALLY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND BEFORE THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENT, NEW HAMPSHIRE SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN TRIED TO GET THE CROWD PUMPED UP FOR HILLARY, BUT THE CROWD STARTED CHANTING FOR BERNIE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GOTTA SEE THIS. I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN A A LITTLE FRUSTRATED. BUT TAKE A LOOK. THIS IS REAL.
WE NEED TO ELECT HILLARY, NOT ONLY TO KEEP DONALD TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE -- [ CHEERS ]
BERNIE! BERNIE! BERNIE! BERNIE!
HILLARY! HILLARY! HILLARY! [ LAUGHTER ] HILLARY! HILLARY! OKAY. WE NEED TO GET TO HILLARY HERE.

Steve: JEANNE SHAHEEN.
Jimmy: BUT NOW THAT THE NOMINEES FOR BOTH PARTIES ARE OFFICIAL, IT MEANS IT'S THE END OF THE PRIMARY SEASON FOR THIS YEAR'S ELECTION. SO LET'S TAKE A MOMENT AND LOOK BACK AND APPRECIATE ALL THE GREAT CANDIDATES THAT WE HAD TO CHOOSE FROM -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- THIS YEAR. PLEASE, TAKE A LOOK.
THIS PRESIDENT IS MORE INTERESTED IN FUNDING -- LESS INTERESTED IN FUNDING THE MILITARY THAN HE IS IN FUNDING PLANNED -- THAN HE IS -- HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN FUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD THAN HE IS IN FUNDING THE MILITARY.
YOU KNOW, I -- I -- I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH -- IF I WERE IN CHARGE RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE IRS, THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY -- UH, THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND HUD.
