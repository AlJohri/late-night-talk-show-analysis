Jimmy: FANTASTIC! WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, MY GOODNESS. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. BIG TROUBLE FOR TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY. YEAH, HE'S BEEN INDICTED ON TWO FELONY CHARGES AFTER HE THREATENED TO VETO FUNDING FOR A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE UNLESS SHE STEPPED DOWN. YEAH, HE'S NOW THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL GOVERNOR IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH IS WHY TODAY HE GOT A GIFT BASKET FROM CHRIS CHRISTIE. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL THE FOOD WAS MISSING, BUT STILL. IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] A BUNCH OF STICKS? IT'S AN EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. RICK PERRY WAS INDICTED FOR COERCION AND OFFICIAL OPPRESSION BY A PUBLIC SERVANT. BUT THOSE AREN'T THE ONLY CHARGES HE'S FACING. HE'S STILL FIGHTING THE CHARGE OF EXCESSIVE CORN DOGGERY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY! HO!
Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO PRISON WITH A PHOTO LIKE THAT FLOATING AROUND.
Steve: NO.
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, BECAUSE OF THE SCANDAL, IT LOOKS LIKE HIS CHANCES IN 2016 MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE. OR AS HILLARY PUT IT, "ONE DOWN, FOUR MORE TO GO." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ANOTHER POTENTIAL CANDIDATE, FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR JEB BUSH, JUST ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS AGAINST MEDICAL MARIJUANA IN THE STATES BECAUSE IT COULD HURT THE TOURISM INDUSTRY.

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] JULIAN ASSANGE. WELL ANYWAYS, JULIAN ASSANGE, HE'S IN THE NEWS. HE IS LEAVING THE ECUADORIAN EMBASSY IN LONDON WHERE HE'S BEEN HIDING FROM CRIMINAL CHARGES, APPARENTLY, BECAUSE HE'S SUFFERING FROM A VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY FROM SPENDING TWO YEARS TRAPPED INDOORS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WAIT A MINUTE. CAN WE SEE A PHOTO OF JULIAN ASSANGE BEFORE HE WENT INTO HIDING? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE NOW? POWDER? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I SAW THAT YESTERDAY THE 49ers PLAYED THEIR FIRST GAME IN THE NEW LEVI'S STADIUM. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. THE STADIUM SEATS 68,000 PEOPLE. UNLESS THEY LEAVE IT IN THE DRYER TOO LONG, THEN IT ONLY SEATS 43,000 PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF FOOTBALL, I READ THAT SEVERAL OF THE NEW YORK JETS PLAYERS ADMITTED TO USING THE POPULAR DATING APP TINDER TO MEET WOMEN. [ CHEERS ] YEAH, AND IT TURNS OUT A LOT OF OTHER PLAYERS AND COACHES AROUND THE NFL ALSO USE THE APP. WE ACTUALLY GOT A HOLD OF SOME OF THEIR TINDER PROFILES, AND SOME OF THEIR -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOME OF THEIR -- SOME OF THEIR PICK UP LINES ARE PRETTY INTERESTING.

SWIPE RIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, YOU GUYS HAVE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THIS, BUT PEOPLE EVERYWHERE HAVE BEEN DOING THE ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE TO RAISE MONEY FOR A.L.S. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S GREAT. WE DID IT ON OUR SHOW AND WE DONATED. AND SO FAR, IT'S HELPED THE A.L.S. ASSOCIATION RAISE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN JUST A A FEW WEEKS. WELL, THIS WEEKEND, OUR PAL TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD -- [ LAUGHTER ] HE GOT IN ON THE ACTION. THIS IS SO JANKY. IT IS LIKE -- IT'S LIKE BUMPER STICKERS STUCK ON A -- IT'S NOT EVEN AN ICE BUCKET.

[ AUDIENCE OOHS ] IT'S PRETTY BAD. THE OTHER DAY, I GOT PULLED OVER FOR SPEEDING AND THE COP WAS LIKE, "HEY, DO YOU MIND GETTING OUT OF YOUR CAR AND COMING TO MY WINDOW?" [ LAUGHTER ] "IS THAT COOL?"
Steve: THAT'S NOT GOOD.
Jimmy: THIS IS KIND OF SURPRISING TO ME. A SURVEY JUST CAME OUT THAT FOUND THAT 75% OF AMERICANS DON'T USE UP ALL OF THEIR VACATION DAYS.
