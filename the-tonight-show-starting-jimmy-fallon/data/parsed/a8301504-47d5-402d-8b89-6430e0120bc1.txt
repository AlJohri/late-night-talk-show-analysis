WE'RE HERE, THIS IS IT! I'M SO HAPPY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE IT'S THE BIG TWO HOUR INTERVIEW WITH BRUCE JENNER OVER ON ABC THIS PAST FRIDAY. EVERYONE TUNED IN TO WATCH BRUCE MAKE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.
ARE YOU A REPUBLICAN?
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S RIGHT, BRUCE JENNER DECLARED HE IS A WOMAN AND A A REPUBLICAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IN OTHER WORDS, THE GOP FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO BEAT HILLARY. SO, THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BRUCE 2016. BRUCE 2016. BRUCE 2016. THAT'S RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE BIG STORY BRUCE TOLD DIANE SAWYER, QUOTE "FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES I AM A A WOMAN." AT WHICH POINT JOE BIDEN RAN IN AND STARTED GIVING HIM A A SHOULDER RUB. [ LAUGHTER ] DOESN'T WASTE ANY TIME THAT GUY, YEAH. THIS WEEKEND WAS ALSO THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT'S DINNER. AND AS PER TRADITION, PRESIDENT OBAMA TOLD A BUNCH OF JOKES TO THE CROWD AND EVERYONE SEEMED TO THINK HE DID A GREAT JOB. IN FACT, HE WAS SO FUNNY THAT NBC IS ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT GIVING OBAMA HIS OWN SITCOM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY EVEN CAME UP WITH A FEW TITLES FOR THE SHOW. CHECK THESE OUT. FIRST THERE'S, "SAVED BY MICHELLE." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S GOOD. THEN THERE'S, "THE WONDER EARS." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: AND FINALLY "HOMELAND IMPROVEMENT" WHICH LOOK'S FUNNY. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD YOU GUYS. THERE WERE REPORTS THAT THE RUSSIANS, WHO HACKED INTO THE WHITE HOUSE COMPUTER SYSTEM, WERE ABLE TO READ SOME OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S E-MAIL.

Jimmy: THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 3016. WELL, WAIT -- I'M SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK HE MIGHT NEED A A SHOULDER RUB AFTER THAT, YEAH. OF COURSE HILLARY CLINTON'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IS IN FULL SWING. SHE HAS ORGANIZED A SUPPORT TEAM IN ALL 50 STATES WHILE HER POTENTIAL OPPONENTS ARE STILL IN ONLY ONE STATE, DENIAL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND MANY BELIEVE THAT DURING HER SPEECH IN NEW YORK CITY LAST WEEK, HILLARY CLINTON WAS CHANNELING PRESIDENT OBAMA. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THAT SPEECH UH -- STILL UH -- HASN'T UH -- ENDED YET. UH -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "NOW LOOK UH -- " THAT'S RIGHT, MANY BELIEVE THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS CHANNELING PRESIDENT OBAMA DURING HER SPEECH IN NEW YORK CITY.

WHAT DO YOUR THINK IS THE COSMOLOGICAL EFFECT OF ZAYN LEAVING ONE DIRECTION. AND CONSEQUENTIALLY BREAKING THE HEARTS OF MILLIONS OF TEENAGED GIRLS ACROSS THE WORLD.
FINALLY, A QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YES! THAT'S GREAT. HE ACTUALLY ENDED UP GIVING A A COMPLICATED ANSWER IN WHICH HE SAYS, THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER UNIVERSE -- THERE MAY BE ANOTHER UNIVERSE WHERE ZAYN IS STILL WITH THE GROUP. THEN HE SAID, "AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I KEEP TELLING MYSELF." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ STEPHEN HAWKING VOICE ] YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. AND FINALLY I SAW THAT AN ALL-MALE HOOTERS INSPIRED RESTAURANT IS OPENING UP IN DALLAS CALLED "TALLYWACKERS."

Jimmy: THIS WAS AT YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY?
IT REPRESENTED THE '60s. SO, "IT'S MY PARTY AND I'LL CRY IF I WANT TO" WAS PLAYING. AND THERE WAS, LIKE, OLD VIETNAM-ERA FOOTAGE.
Jimmy: WOW.
THEN A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF HAPPENED. AND THEN AT THE END I REQUIRED PEOPLE TO GO DOWN A YELLOW SLIDE INTO A BALL PIT.
Jimmy: COME ON, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S A BIRTHDAY PARTY RIGHT THERE.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I SAID, "I WANT A SLIDE AND A A BALL PIT." THEY'RE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, WE CAN DO THAT." I WAS LIKE, "REALLY?" [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELL, I SAID TO YOU, "THAT'S RIGHT, FRANCIS." I FORGOT TO TELL YOU, I BURIED THE LEDE. I DID NAME MY DAUGHTER FRANCIS. I GO --
THAT WASN'T ENOUGH. THEN YOU SAID, "WHAT WERE YOU CALLED WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE, FRAN? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT TO CALL HER." SO I SAID, "I WAS CALLED FRANCIE," AND NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL HER.
Jimmy: IT'S A PERFECT NICKNAME FOR HER. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S A PERFECT NICKNAME.
Jimmy: NO, SHE HAS HER OWN IDENTITY AND SHE'S HER OWN BABY. WE DON'T -- I'M NOT STEALING ANYTHING. THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE BABY. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S GOT HER OWN PERSONALITY.
YES, BUT -- NO CIGARETTES.
Jimmy: NO CIGARETTE. NO, NOT YET. SHE'S NOT OLD ENOUGH.
I WILL OFFER TO TEACH YOUR DAUGHTER TO SMOKE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO TEACH HER HOW TO SMOKE? YOU CAN'T --
BECAUSE PROBABLY YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT IT.
Jimmy: I AM NOT GOOD AT IT, ACTUALLY, YEAH. YOU WERE NICE ENOUGH TO GIVE ME THIS CHILDREN'S BOOK WHEN MY FIRST DAUGHTER WAS BORN, AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND YOU AUTOGRAPHED IT, "TO WINNIE." AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD UPDATE IT FOR FRANCIE. [ LAUGHTER ] 'CAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE IT! COME ON, SHE WOULD --
COULD I LEND YOU SOME MONEY OR SOMETHING? [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU HAVE A CAR?
Jimmy: NO, I --
I'M SURE YOU DO.
Jimmy: I DON'T. I DRIVE A TRUCK, ACTUALLY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DO I LOOK LIKE A TRUCK-DRIVING GUY?
NO. NO YOU DON'T. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE A LITTLE -- ONE OF THOSE LITTLE TRUCKS.
Jimmy: A LITTLE TINY TRUCK? THAT'D BE GOOD.
THIS IS GOOD, BECAUSE I'M NOT GIVING YOU ANOTHER ONE. SO SHE CAN SHARE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH!
BECAUSE SHE -- YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SHE HAS HER OWN APARTMENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT.
AND I KNOW HER NAME.
Jimmy: YEAH. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M GETTING IT RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: PERFECT. FRANCIE. YEAH.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO MY YOUNGER SISTER, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN I WAS -- I'M THE OLDER SISTER. SO MY SISTER, WHO WAS YOUNGER, GOT MY CLOTHES AND YOUR DAUGHTER IS GETTING HER BOOKS.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
YOU SEE? BUT HER OWN APARTMENT, SO -- OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T -- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE IT UP FOR ME, BECAUSE I'M WEARING YOUR GLASSES AND TRYING TO DO A BIT. YOU GET IT?
I DIDN'T NOTICE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE SHOULD GO TO A A COMEDY CLUB ONE NIGHT. I HAVE TO SAY, FRAN, I ALWAYS LOVE EVERYTHING I READ ABOUT YOU. YOU ARE VERY WITTY AND VERY FUNNY AND I READ SOMETHING AT ELLE.COM -- NOT THE LETTER L BUT E-L-L-E.COM -- ABOUT FASHION AND THEY INTERVIEWED YOU.
IS THAT YOUR FAVORITE MAGAZINE? ELLE? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, BUT THE GIRLS LIKE IT. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW, SOMEONE SENT IT TO ME, BECAUSE THEY KNOW I'M A FAN OF YOURS, AND I READ IT. AND I LAUGHED OUT LOUD.
Jimmy: AFTER THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY -- SHOULD COME OUT AND I SHOULD BE SHOCKED OF WHAT THE FASHIONS THEY'RE WEARING, AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN WEARING ANY CRAZY FASHIONS."
NO, NO, I DIDN'T SAY IT WASN'T CRAZY. I SAID THAT -- NOT JUST CLOTHES BUT -- LIKE, YOU WERE TALKING TO ROBERT DOWNEY JR., AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT VINYL. OKAY, SO, EVERY SINGLE THING COMES BACK. YOU KNOW, IT NEVER REALLY GOES AWAY. AND SO I WAS SAYING THAT THEIR JOB -- THE JOB OF PEOPLE WHO ARE YOUNG IS TO DO SOMETHING NEW. ANNOY ME NOT WITH BORING ME WITH THINGS I ALREADY SAW.
