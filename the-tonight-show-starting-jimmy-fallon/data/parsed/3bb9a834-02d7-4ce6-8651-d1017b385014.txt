[ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, I WOULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE PREVIOUS "TONIGHT SHOW" HOSTS. SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO STEVE ALLEN, JACK PARR, JOHNNY CARSON, JAY LENO, CONAN O'BRIEN AND JAY LENO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] VERY, VERY NICE. AMAZING. HONESTLY, I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT HERE. I GREW UP IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. IN A TOWN CALLED SAUGERTIES, NEW YORK. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TOWN. I HAD A GREAT CHILDHOOD. [ APPLAUSE ] THERE'S NOT EVEN THAT MANY PEOPLE FROM SAUGERTIES. SO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I HAD A GREAT CHILDHOOD. AND IF YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME AS A KID THAT I WAS GOING TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND GO ON TO BE ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." AND THEN EVENTUALLY BE THE HOST OF "THE TONIGHT SHOW" -- I WOULD'VE SAID, "I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL?" THAT'S SO NOT ME. THAT IS SO NOT LIKE ME. BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WATCHING ME FOR THE FIRST TIME, WHICH IS VERY POSSIBLE. I'M 39 YEARS OLD. I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY WITH MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE, NANCY. AND MY DAUGHTER, WINNIE, WHO'S 6 MONTHS OLD. AND SHE'S THE BEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE HER SO MUCH. I'M A PROUD, PROUD DAD.

THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I WISH I COULD'VE GOTTEN YOU BETTER SEATS. BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S -- [ LAUGHTER ] VERY HOT SHOW, DAD. VERY HOT SHOW. TRYING TO DO BITS UP THERE. BUT I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF ME. I KNOW YOU'RE PROUD OF ME. I KNOW -- I MEAN, YOU ARE. [ APPLAUSE ] REMEMBER HOW PROUD YOU WERE WHEN I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL? THAT WAS A BIG DEAL. YEAH, THAT WAS GIANT. ANYWAY, I'M HAPPY JUST TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANKS FOR BEING HERE, GUYS. I LOVE YOU. I KNOW, DAD. [ LAUGHTER ] HE DID NOT PAY A LOT -- IT WAS A PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL. HE DIDN'T PAY A LOT OF MONEY. [ LAUGHTER ] PAID A LOT OF MONEY, YEARH. BUT AGAIN, IF YOU'RE WATCHING, TO THE LEFT, IS THE MOST TALENTED BAND IN ALL THE LAND. TRYING TO LEND A HAND -- THE ROOTS FROM PHILADELPHIA, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I LOVE YOU GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY ARE THE MOST TALENTED BAND. AND YOU'RE GOING TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THEM IF YOU DON'T KNOW THEM ALREADY. THEY'RE FROM PHILADELPHIA. A LOT OF THE GUYS STILL COMMUTE AND GO BACK AND FORTH FROM PHILLY.

Jimmy: THIS IS A MOMENT IN TV HISTORY. [ LAUGHTER ] A MOMENT IN TV HISTORY RIGHT HERE. AND EVEN IF I WEREN'T INVOLVED, I WOULD BE SO PSYCHED TO WATCH IT. SO I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE WATCHING AT HOME. I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE. BECAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT. THIS IS FUN. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT. I REMEMBER BEING THE KID IN SAUGERTIES AND ASKING MY PARENTS, "CAN I STAY UP TO WATCH JOHNNY CARSON?" AND IT WAS A BIG DEAL, LIKE, YOU KNOW, TO STAY UP LATE, YOU KNOW? THEY WOULD LET ME WATCH THE MONOLOGUE AND THEN I'D JUST TRY TO PRETEND I WASN'T THERE. SO THEY COULD LET ME GO TO THE FIRST GUEST OR WHATEVER BIT THEY WERE GOING TO DO BEFORE THEY TOLD ME TO GO TO BED. AND JUST TO THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A KID OUT THERE ASKING THEIR PARENTS TO STAY UP TO WATCH ME -- IT JUST MEANS A LOT. SO I HOPE -- I HOPE I DO WELL. [ APPLAUSE ] I JUST WANT TO DO THE BEST THAT I CAN. AND TAKE CARE OF THIS SHOW FOR AWHILE. IF YOU GUYS LET ME STICK AROUND LONG ENOUGH, MAYBE I'LL GET THE HANG OF IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] USUALLY, OUR SHOW STARTS WITH THE MONOLOGUE, THE FIRST TEN MINUTES OF OUR SHOW. SO AFTER YOUR LOCAL NEWS, I'LL COME OUT FROM THAT BEAUTIFUL CURTAIN. I'LL HIT THIS MONOLOGUE MARK HERE, WHICH IS A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER. THAT'S WHERE I STAND OVER THAT. THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE. SO I'LL STAND OVER THAT AND READ JOKES OFF THE CUE CARDS. AND THESE ARE JOKES BASED ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE NEWS. STUFF LIKE THAT. I'LL MAKE FUN OF EVERYBODY. ANYONE I CAN MAKE FUN OF, I WILL. MY GOAL IS JUST TO MAKE YOU LAUGH AND PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE. SO YOU GO TO SLEEP WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE AND LIVE A LONGER LIFE. ISN'T THAT THE WHOLE GOAL OF WHAT WE'RE DOING? HAVE FUN?

YOU CAN TELL HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE WHEN HE SPENT HALF AN HOUR INTERVIEWING A MOP HE THOUGHT WAS SHAUN WHITE. HE WAS LIKE, "NOW, I'VE SEEN YOU'VE GROWN YOUR HAIR BACK. YOU'RE VERY SKINNY. YOU'VE LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MANY AMAZING ATHLETES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD COMPETING IN SOCHI. AND OF COURSE, THEY GIVE OUT GOLD, SILVER AND BRONZE MEDALS AT THE GAMES. BUT WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS THAT THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE ALSO GIVES OUT OTHER AWARDS.

Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD SONG, AS WELL. BUT I THINK -- LET BONO GO UP. I MEAN, CAN YOU DO A SPEECH ABOUT THE -- THIS COFFEE MUG? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, YOU COULD PROBABLY DO IT.
THAT'S NOT NICE -- I CAN ONLY -- I CAN ONLY GIVE SPEECHES ABOUT THINGS I BELIEVE IN. BUT I -- I BELIEVE IN THIS CUP. [ LAUGHTER ] AND REALLY, IT'S NOT A CUP, REALLY. IT'S A CONTAINER. IT DEMANDS TO BE FILLED. IT CAN BE FILLED BY LOVE OR BAD THOUGHTS. AND, IN FACT, THIS CUP WAS HELD IN THE HAND OF NELSON MANDELA ACTUALLY ON ROBIN ISLAND.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT? NOW YOU'RE MAKING IT UP.
NO, NO, AND THIS IS WHEN HE MADE HIS FAMOUS SPEECH. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] YES, HE DID. HE SAID SHE'S A BAD GIRL.
Jimmy: HE DID NOT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BONO, I APPRECIATE THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I ALWAYS THOUGHT, IF I EVER HAD U2, IF I HAD YOU GUYS SITTING ON THE COUCH AND HERE WITH ME TONIGHT, I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE IF YOU COULD DO A SONG FOR ME, AN ACOUSTIC SONG JUST TO SHOW EVERYBODY YOU'VE GOT THE GOODS. AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IF I COULD -- IF I HANDED YOU A MICROPHONE AND HANDED YOU A GUITAR, CAN YOU DO A LITTLE --
LIKE ONE OF THOSE SPONTANEOUS SHOW BUSINESS MOMENTS WHERE THEY APPEAR FROM BEHIND THE COUCH? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YES, EXACTLY. WE HAVE THINGS HIDDEN BEHIND THE COUCH. YOU HAVE SEEN TALK SHOWS IN AMERICA, YES -- WOULD YOU BE DOWN FOR THAT?
YEAH.
YEAH, OF COURSE.
WHAT AN IDEA! [ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS A SONG WE ARE SO PROUD OF, WON AN ACADEMY AWARD, AND --
Jimmy: SURE, YOU CAN DO WHAT -- YES, YOU CAN DO -- I HAVE A GUITAR FOR YOU.
OH, WOW. CHECK IT OUT.
Jimmy: THAT'S MY PERSONAL ONE, YEAH.
ACTUALLY, WHILE THEY ARE STANDING UP. HOLD ON A SECOND.
THANK YOU.
