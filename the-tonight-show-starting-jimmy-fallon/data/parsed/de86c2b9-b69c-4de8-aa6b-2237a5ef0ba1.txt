Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- SUSAN SARANDON, ELIJAH WOOD, MUSICAL GUEST LITTLE BIG TOWN, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 630 ILLINOIS, YEAH!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. THEY'RE READY. IT'S A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYONE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, BABY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT. COME ON! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." HEY, ONE OF THE BIG STORIES EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT IS THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE. AND GET THIS. I SAW THAT POPE FRANCIS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN TWEETING BIBLE REFERENCES THAT OPPOSED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN. YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG WHEN YOU'RE GETTING CYBER BULLIED BY THE POPE. YOU KNOW -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HIT STOP.
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN JUST GOT BACK FROM A TOUR OF THE U.S./MEXICO BORDER AND WHILE HE WAS THERE HE ACTUALLY RODE A HORSE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN HE SAW RYAN WEARING A A SHIRT, ONE GUY SAID, "YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BOTH BARE BACK. YOU AND HORSE." [ LAUGHTER ] DOUBLE BARE BACK.
Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, THAT'S IT. CAREFUL.
Jimmy: ACTUALLY -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HEY-OH!
Jimmy: BEAR CLAW?
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: WHAT DID YOU SAY?
Steve: BARE OF NOTICE. DOUBLE BARE -- [ LAUGHTER ] DOUBLE BARE BACK.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, THERE ARE RUMORS THAT RUSSIA'S COMPILING A A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE ON TRUMP TO HELP PUTIN GET INSIDE HIS HEAD. YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT'S SO HARD TO GET TRUMP TO OPEN UP AND TALK ABOUT HIMSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S GOOD TO GET THOSE THINGS -- [ APPLAUSE ] HE KEEPS A LOT OF STUFF PRIVATE. I SAW THAT APPLE IS CRITICIZING TRUMP AFTER HE OVERTURNED THE RULE THAT LETS TRANSGENDER STUDENTS USE THE BATHROOM OF THEIR CHOICE. APPLE SAYS THAT REGARDLESS OF YOUR GENDER, EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DROP AN iPHONE INTO WHICHEVER TOILET THEY WANT. [ LAUGHTER ] AS LONG AS YOU KEEP BUYING iPHONES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ABSOLUTELY. BUT TRUMP IS STILL WORKING HARD TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH BUSINESSES. IN FACT THIS MORNING HE HELD A A MEETING WITH A GROUP OF CEOs AT THE WHITE HOUSE. TRUMP SAID HE WANTS TO REPLACE ROBOTS WITH HUMAN WORKERS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN MIKE PENCE SAYS, "I'LL SHOW MYSELF OUT." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT TRUMP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESS COULD STILL USE SOME WORK. I SAW THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, TRUMP'S STAFF WILL TRY TO KEEP HIM CALM BY SHOWING HIM LOTS OF PRO-TRUMP NEWS COVERAGE. HIS CURRENT STAFF IT TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING BUT IT'S GETTING TOUGH TO FIND ANYTHING POSITIVE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CHECK OUT WHAT THEY SHOWED HIM THIS WEEK.
DONALD TRUMP IS --
SMART.
GREAT.
TREMENDOUS.
WONDERFUL.
INCREDIBLE.
AMAZING.
REMARKABLE.
AND.
HANDSOME.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MIGHT HAVE BEEN EDITED A A LITTLE.
Steve: A LITTLE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
Steve: JUST A LITTLE.
Jimmy: IT SEEMS LIKE TRUMP'S STAFF IS STILL TRYING TO GET HANDLE ON THINGS. IN FACT ONE INSIDER SAYS THERE'S NO RHYME OR REASON TO WHO TRUMP PICKS FOR HIS ADMINISTRATION. TRUMP WAS LIKE, "NOT TRUE. THERE'S DEFINITELY A RHYMING. [ LAUGHTER ] EANIE, MEANIE, MINIE, MOE. [ LAUGHTER ] EANIE AND MEANIE RHYMES. [ APPLAUSE ] AND MOE WAS THE REASON. HOWEVER JOHN MCCAIN ACTUALLY PRAISED TRUMP'S NEW NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR H.R. McMASTER, CALLING HIM AN OUTSTANDING CHOICE AND A MAN OF GENUINE INTELLECT, CHARACTER, AND ABILITY. THEN TRUMP SAID, "IN THAT CASE, FORGET IT. GET ME STEVEN SEAGAL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HEY GUYS, THIS IS GOING VIRAL. THE PRESIDENT OF FINLAND HAS A A DOG NAMED LENNU, I THINK I'M PRONOUNCING THAT RIGHT. AND SOME RECENT PHOTOS HAVE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION ON THE INTERNET HERE. TAKE A LOOK AT HIM. LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] ISN'T HE CUTE? WELL, WE ACTUALLY DECIDED TO MAKE SOME MEMES FOR LENNU. [ LAUGHTER ] CHECK THIS OUT. THIS FIRST MEME IS CALLED, "WHEN BAE LIKED YOUR NEW PROFILE PIC." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT ONE'S CALLED, "WHEN YOU SEE THE SERVER BRINGING THE APPETIZERS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY THERE'S, "WHEN YOU DRINK AND TRY TO ACT NORMAL." SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE.
YEP.
Jimmy: BUT FIRST.

Jimmy: THIS IS BIZARRE. OF COURSE IT'S TRUE BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH "THE BACHELOR."

Jimmy: YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH NICK?
I'M FRIENDS WITH NICK. [ CHEERS ] OKAY. SO THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN --
Jimmy: THAT'S REAL?
IT WAS THE NIGHT --
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT A A CARDBOARD CUTOUT?
NO. "THAT FORCE AWAKENS" CAME OUT. THIS IS MY FRIEND KYLE AND THAT'S HOW I KNOW NICK.
Jimmy: THROUGH KYLE.
THROUGH MY FRIEND KYLE. YEAH.
Jimmy: AND YOU GUYS ARE JUST POSING BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE FOR "STAR WARS."
WE WERE THERE FOR "STAR WARS," YEAH. IT WAS -- SENT THE FAMILY TO THE SCREENING OF IT. WE WATCHED IT AND, YEAH. I'VE KNOWN NICK SINCE BEFORE HE BECAME "THE BACHELOR" WHICH IS THE CRAZIEST THING.
Jimmy: BUT DID YOU KNOW HIM FROM "THE BACHELORETTE"?
DID NOT KNOW HIM.
Jimmy: REALLY?
SO MY FRIEND -- NO. MY FRIEND KYLE SAW HIM AT LOLLAPALOOZA AND LIKE RECOGNIZED HIM. TOOK A PHOTO WITH HIM. THEY BECAME FRIENDS AND THEY STARTED HANGING OUT. NICK MOVED OUT TO L.A. AND THEY WERE -- BECAME FAST FRIENDS. AND SO HE WAS JUST AROUND AND I WOULD HANG OUT WITH HIM. AND I KIND OF KNEW ABOUT HIS "BACHELORETTE" EXPERIENCES AND FOUND IT FASCINATING.
Jimmy: YEAH, ME TOO.
AND THEN, APPARENTLY -- AND THEN HE --
Jimmy: I LOV -- I'M OBS -- I LOVED "THE BACHELOR." I LOVE -- WELL, I MEAN, NOT I LOVE NICK, BUT I MEAN I LOVE THE IDEA --
RIGHT. OF "THE BACHELOR."
Jimmy: OF THE "BACHELOR." YEAH.
SO I KNEW THAT HE WAS "THE BACHELOR" BEFORE IT WAS ANNOUNCED AND EVERYTHING. [ GASPS ] YEAH! [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN HE WAS ON -- AND THEN HE, YOU KNOW -- AND THEN HE'S ON LOCK FOR TWO MONTHS AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON.
Jimmy: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT DOES ON LOCK MEAN? YEAH!
HE'S DOING THE SHOW.
Jimmy: I KNOW. NO ONE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF.
IT'S FASCINATING.
Jimmy: SO, HE'S ON LOCK.
YEAH.
NOT COMMUNICATING WITH -- YOU CAN'T.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T USE THE CELL PHONE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: CAN'T CHECK THE INNER -- THE INNER WEB.
NOT THE INTERNET.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T PHONE CALL ANYONE.
IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE JAIL WHERE YOU GET YOUR CALL.
Jimmy: NO, NOT EVEN -- IT'S WORSE THAN JAIL.
IT'S WORSE THAN JAIL.
Jimmy: WORSE THAN JAIL. SO NICK IS THERE.
EXCEPT YOU GOT 20 GIRLS THAT YOU GOT TO --
Jimmy: 20 BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT IT'S REAL, RIGHT?
IT'S REAL.
Jimmy: HE'S FINDING -- HE'S LOOKING FOR LOVE?
YES. [ LAUGHTER ] HE IS.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. MAN. I DON'T KNOW. I KIND OF THOUGHT --
HERE -- HERE'S THE THING --
Jimmy: I KIND OF LOOKED INSIDE YOUR BRAIN. [ LAUGHTER ]
LOOK, HERE'S THE THING --
Jimmy: I DON'T BUY IT.
HERE'S THE THING ABOUT NICK --
Jimmy: YEAH. YEAH. THAT'S LIKE A SPINOFF SHOW.
A LOT OF PEOPLE --
Jimmy: HERE'S THE THING ABOUT NICK.
HERE'S THE THING ABOUT NICK.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE QUESTION IF HE IS REAL OR IF THAT IS REALLY HIM ON THE SHOW IN THE WAY HE'S PRESENTING HIMSELF.
Jimmy: YES.
AND THAT IS HIM. HE'S A VERY GENUINE INDIVIDUAL. HE'S GOT A LOT OF INTEGRITY. I CAN UNEQUIVOCALLY SAY THAT.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YES.
Jimmy: YEAH, SO THIS -- WHEN HE'S CRYING AND SUCH -- DO YOU WATCH THE SHOW?
I -- I NOW HAVE STARTED WATCHING THE SHOW, BECAUSE I'M SO CURIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE NEVER SEEN THE SHOW IN MY LIFE. BUT, BECAUSE I KNOW NICK, I'M LIKE --
Jimmy: I KNOW, BUT DO YOU WATCH THE SHOW?
I WATCH THE SHOW EVERY MONDAY.
Jimmy: ME, TOO.
YES!
Jimmy: AND THE SHOW'S FANTASTIC! [ CHEERS ]
IT'S REALLY WEIRD.
Jimmy: AND CORINNE.
CORRINE.
Jimmy: WHAT IS GOING ON WITH CORINNE? WHAT IS HAPPENING?
AND HER PLATINUM VAGINE. [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW.
Jimmy: THE PV. WHO ARE YOU ROOTING FOR? CAN I ASK YOU THAT?
I'VE BEEN ROOTING FOR RACHEL THE WHOLE TIME.
Jimmy: DUDE, WHAT IS UP WITH THAT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
SO WHAT IS THAT? RIGHT?
Jimmy: WAIT. I'M MAD ALMOST.
I'M A LITTLE MAD, TOO, BECAUSE THEY ANNOUNCED THAT SHE'S THE BACHELORETTE.
Jimmy: WHICH MEANS --
SHE'S OUT BUT WE'VE NOT SEEN SHE'S OUT YET SO IT'S A BIG SPOILER, AND IT'S DOWN TO THREE, SO, I GUESS I AM INVESTED.
Jimmy: YEAH, I MEAN, ME, TOO. SO SHE'S OUT, BUT SHE WAS MY -- I LOVED HER.
SHE'S MY FAVORITE.
Jimmy: ME -- THAT'S MY FAVORITE.
ALWAYS MY FAVORITE. I LOVE RACHEL, BUT IT'S GREAT SHE'S GOING TO BE THE BACHELORETTE.
Jimmy: I KNOW, BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT THAT SHOW. BUT --
BUT NOW IT'S DOWN TO THREE, RIGHT? IF IT'S NOT RACHEL.
Jimmy: I MISSED LAST WEEK'S EPISODE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WHAT ABOUT -- THAT WAS HOMECOMING. LIKE, THE I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. [ LAUGHTER ] I ACTUALLY -- CANNOT BELIEVE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER IN THREE YEARS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S INSANE. WHAT HAVE I BECOME?
Jimmy: NO, NO. IT'S US. IT'S GREAT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR MOVIE, BECAUSE I REALLY DO, AND THEN WE GOT TO TALK AFTER THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: MY BEST TO NICK. I HOPE HE FINDS LOVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, SAME. I WILL PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
YEAH.
Jimmy: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FILM. WHEN DOES IT PREMIERE ON NETFLIX? TOMORROW?
TOMORROW.
Jimmy: YEAH, GREAT. AND WHAT IS THE TITLE AGAIN?
"I DON'T FEEL AT HOME IN THIS WORLD ANYMORE."
Jimmy: IT'S A GREAT TITLE.
IT'S A GREAT TITLE.
Jimmy: IT'S A REFERENCE TO ONE OF THE SONGS THAT'S PLAYED IN THE FILM.
YEAH. AND IT'S ACTUALLY, IT WAS INSPIRED BY MISSISSIPPI RECORDS PUT OUT A COMPILATION CALLED "I DON'T FEEL AT HOME IN THIS WORLD ANYMORE" MANY YEARS AGO AND IT'S ALL KIND OF SOUTHERN ROOTS MUSIC.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THERE'S A SONG BY THAT TITLE. AND THE DIRECTOR AND WRITER MACON BLAIR WAS GIVEN THAT BY HIS FRIEND JEREMY, AND HE JUST SORT OF IN LOVE WITH IT. AND IT WAS SORT OF FITTING INTO THE CONTEXT OF WHAT THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THIS FILM IS GOING THROUGH. SHE'S KIND OF GOING THROUGH AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS. SHE DOESN'T FEEL CONNECTED TO ANYBODY AND SHE SORT OF FEELS LIKE THE WORLD'S A BUNCH OF [ BLEEP ]. SO THAT'S KIND OF WHY THAT TITLE ULTIMATELY STUCK. AND THE MOVIE IS ABOUT HER. SHE GETS HER -- HER HOUSE IS ROBBED. POLICE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IT'S REINFORCING THE FACT THAT KIND OF NOBODY'S DOING ANY -- ANY GOOD IN THE WORLD. SHE ENLISTS HER FRIEND, PLAYED BY ME. A REAL WEIRD DUDE TO HELP HER FIND HER LOST THINGS AND ULTIMATELY FIND THE PERPETRATORS AND FACE THEM. AND THEY GET IN A LITTLE OVER THEIR HEADS.
Jimmy: BUT IF NICK CHOOSES CORINNE -- [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAYS, THE FILM'S OUT TOMORROW.
IT'S OUT TOMORROW. ON NETFLIX.

Jimmy: YOU DID NOT SEE IT COMING AT ALL?
NO, WE -- OUR -- COMEDY GENRE FILM. WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE WINNING THE GRAND JURY PRIZE.
