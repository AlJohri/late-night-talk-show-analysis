Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THERE. HOT CROWD. WELCOME -- WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW" EVERYBODY. PLEASE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. IT'S GOING TO BE A FUN SHOW TONIGHT. THANKS FOR THAT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THE CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL ACTION CONFERENCE IS STILL GOING ON DOWN IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND YESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP WAS GIVING A SPEECH WHEN HE ACCIDENTALLY REFERRED TO FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER, WHO'S STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE, AS THE LATE GREAT JIMMY CARTER. [ LAUGHTER ] TRUMP IMMEDIATELY APOLOGIZED AND SAID, "WELL, HE WASN'T THAT GREAT." THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SAYING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IN THE SAME SPEECH DONALD TRUMP CLAIMED THAT THE ACTUAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE U.S. IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO 21 OR 22%. AND WHO WOULD KNOW BETTER THAN A MAN WHO FIRES PEOPLE FOR A A LIVING? [ LAUGHTER ] I FIRED 12% -- AND DID YOU SEE THIS TOO, YESTERDAY AT THE CONFERENCE, LOUISIANA GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL SAID THAT OBAMA IS ACTUALLY A A WORSE PRESIDENT THAN JIMMY CARTER. THEN TRUMP WAS LIKE "MAN, WHAT A TERRIBLE EULOGY." [ LAUGHTER ] NO, HE'S NOT DEAD. HE'S VERY MUCH ALIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF THE GOP THIS WEEK THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS HELD THEIR 50th VOTE TO DERAIL OBAMACARE. OBAMA WAS PRETTY INSULTED, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE TOOK CARE OF THAT MONTHS AGO WHEN HE LAUNCHED THE WEBSITE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU CAN'T LOG IN. IT DOESN'T WORK. I MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK. YOU CAN'T DO IT. TRY IT. I DARE YOU, TRY IT. YOU GOT TO HAND IT TO HIM. THE PRESIDENT'S STILL TRYING TO MAKE OBAMACARE WORK. IN FACT, LAST WEEK HE MET WITH SOME OF THE BIGGEST CELEBRITIES ON YOUTUBE TO TALK ABOUT GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE SIGNED UP. OF COURSE MOST OF THE YOUTUBE CELEBRITIES WERE CATS. BUT, STILL THEY HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT GONNA NEED THAT ORANGE PEEL HELMET ANYMORE. OBAMACARE COVERS IT. GET OFF YOUR KEYBOARD, FALL OFF THE KEYBOARD. [ LAUGHTER ] PLANKING. STOMPING ON GRAPES? COVERED. [ LAUGHTER ] CHARLIE BITING YOUR FINGER COVERED TOO. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE LAST NIGHT. MAN, OH MAN, DID YOU SEE THIS LAST NIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA? TALKING TO ARETHA? THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. SO, PRESIDENT OBAMA LAST NIGHT, HE HOSTED A WHITE HOUSE CONCERT FOR SOUL SINGERS. AND THEN WHEN IT WAS TIME TO TALK ABOUT ARETHA FRANKLIN HE ACTUALLY MISSPELLED THE WORD RESPECT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S GREAT, WATCH IT. IT'S CLASSIC. WATCH THIS.
WHEN ARETHA FIRST TOLD US WHAT R-S-P-E-C-T MEANT TO HER? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GIVE IT UP FOR THE WHITE HALF OF BARACK OBAMA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ R-S-P-C-T R-S-P-E-C-T GIVE IT TO ME GIVE IT TO ME ♪ ♪ GIVE IT TO ME GIVE IT TO ME R-P-S-E-P-C-T ♪ YEAH.

Jimmy: E-T?
Steve: E.T. PHONE HOME? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS ALSO BIG NEWS. THIS WEEK THEY'RE REVAMPING THE SATs. [ CHEERS ] MAKING A LOT OF CHANGES. ONE OF THEM IS TO PHASE OUT OBSCURE VOCABULARY WORDS. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S ABOUT TIME. BECAUSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT PART OF THE TEST WAS COMPLETELY AMPHIBIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT THE COLLEGE BOARD SAYS IT'S REVAMPING THE SAT TO FOCUS ON WHAT STUDENTS WILL NEED IN COLLEGE. IN FACT, THE SAT IS NOW JUST ONE QUESTION, HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOUR PARENTS HAVE? [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ALL WE CARE ABOUT. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW THAT? WELCOME TO COLLEGE, BUDDY. COME ON IN.
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: NOW THEY'RE SAYING THE SATs ARE TOO EASY. YEAH, THEY'RE MAKING IT TOO EASY. LOOK AT TWO OF THE QUESTIONS. LOOK AT THIS. FILL IN ANY TWO BUBBLES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: THAT'S NOT --
Jimmy: THAT'S TOO EASY.

Jimmy: IT'S MUCH TOO --
Steve: THAT'S TOO --
Jimmy: LOOK AT THIS LAST QUESTION. DOESN'T THIS KIND OF LOOK LIKE PACMAN? HA-HA. "A" YES. "B" NO. [ LAUGHTER ] IT DOES A LITTLE BIT.
Steve: IT DID LOOK LIKE PACMAN.
Jimmy: IT DID LOOK LIKE PACMAN.
Steve: IT MADE ME LAUGH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT WASN'T THE QUESTION.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: OF COURSE ANOTHER BIG STORY IS THE ONGOING SITUATION IN UKRAINE, WHICH HAS CAUSED A A LOT OF TENSION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA. BUT, GET THIS. NASA HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH RUSSIA'S SPACE PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH THE PENTAGON HAS SEVERED TIES WITH THE RUSSIAN MILITARY. WHEN ASKED WHY, SCIENTISTS IN BOTH SIDES WERE LIKE, "CAUSE WE'RE BUILDING A ROBOT ARMY --ER, NOTHING." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] HERE'S SOME LIGHTER NEWS, I THOUGHT THIS WAS VERY INTERESTING. THIS WEEK MARKS THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE BUFFALO WING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. WHICH MEANS IT ALSO MARKS THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THAT CELERY STICK NOBODY WANTS. [ LAUGHTER ] DRIED UP AND WEIRD. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE AWARE OF THIS OR NOT BUT TOMORROW IS THE FIFTH ANNUAL NATIONAL DAY OF UNPLUGGING. WHEN PEOPLE ARE ENCOURAGED TO TURN OFF THEIR PHONES. YES. [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] YOU JUST SPEND SATURDAY RELAXING AND THEN SPEND SUNDAY RETURNING 500 TEXTS FROM YOUR MOM EXPLAINING THAT YOU'RE NOT DEAD. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. I'M FINE, MOM! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE SCARING ME.
Steve: WHERE ARE YOU?
Jimmy: SPEAKING OF THE INTERNET, THIS WAS VERY SURPRISING. A NEW REPORT FOUND THAT THE U.S. RANKS 31st IN THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO INTERNET SPEED. THAT'S PRETTY SLOW. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WATCH THIS SHOW ONLINE THE NEXT DAY. AND YOU THINK THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO DEAL WITH REALLY SLOW INTERNET IS JUST -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN JOE BIDEN SAID I'LL TAKE TWO SNAPPLES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: SCHOOL ON SUNDAY.
Jimmy: UH-HUH. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: I'M NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS. I SAW THAT THE F.D.A. IS CONSIDERING A NEW FERTILIZATION TECHNIQUE THAT WOULD USE THE DNA FROM THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO CREATE BABIES. SCIENTISTS SAY, IT WOULD EXTEND THE LIVES OF CHILDREN AND REALLY EXTEND "THE MAURY POVICH SHOW." YOU ARE NOT THE FATHER, BUT YOU ARE AND YOU ARE AND YOU ARE. THE WHOLE AUDIENCE IS THE FATHER. YOU'RE ALL GOING HOME AS THE FATHER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY THIS WEEK, KIM KARDASHIAN REVEALED THAT HER SHOW USES EXTERIOR SHOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S HOMES FOR SECURITY PURPOSES.

I WENT TO THE STATE DINNER THAT THE OBAMAS HELD FOR FRANCOIS HOLLANDE THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE.
Jimmy: HOW AMAZING IS THAT?
I WAS -- I THOUGHT IT HAD TO BE A MISTAKE. AND SO I WENT DOWN TO GO DO IT. WE DID TWO SHOWS ON ONE NIGHT, WHICH IT'S A HUSTLE TO DO. AND WE WENT DOWN THERE AND -- IT'S SO FUN TO GO -- IF YOU GET INVITED YOU GOT TO GO. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S SO FUN. AND ONE -- THE BEST THING IS THAT FRANCOIS HOLLANDE DOESN'T HAVE A WIFE RIGHT NOW. HE'S RUN THROUGH A FEW LADIES. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE FIRST LADY OF FRANCE IS. THE QUESTION WAS WHO WAS GOING TO SIT WITH THE FIRST LADY? BECAUSE MICHELLE OBAMA HAD NOBODY TO SIT WITH HER. AND SO WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE RECEIVING LINE. I SAID TO THE FIRST LADIES, I SAID THANK YOU FOR INVITING US. ME AND MY WIFE EVY. AND I SAID, SO FUN, THIS IS GONNA SUCH A FUN NIGHT. SHE SAID, "OH, IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT, YOU'RE SITTING WITH ME." I WENT HA HA HA. AND I WALKED AWAY.

YOU'VE GOT TO BE FAIRLY FORMAL AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

THEY WILL ALSO ACCEPT TEE HEE HEE. SO, ANYWAY  I WALK AWAY AND MY WIFE SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE SITTING WITH THE FIRST LADY. AND I SAID, "HONEY SHE'S CLEARLY JOKING." I THINK THAT'S SO ADORABLE YOUR HUSBAND WOULD BE ABLE TO SIT WITH THE FIRST LADY. THAT'S REALLY SWEET THAT YOU WOULD THINK THAT OF YOUR HUSBAND. BESIDES WE'RE AT TABLE 19. I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S AT TABLE ONE, DON'T YOU? SO, WE GO IN AND GIVE OUR CARD TO THE USHER THERE. HE SAID YOU'RE SITTING THERE AT THE FRONT TABLE. AND I GO UP AND ON THE TABLE IT SAYS MR.

[ LAUGHTER ] AND HE STARTS TO LAUNCH IN TO FRENCH WITH ME AND THE PRESIDENT CUTS HIM OFF AND INTRODUCES HIM TO SOMEONE ELSE AND I THOUGHT -- THEN AFTER THE DINNER HE COMES UP TO ME AND HE'S LIKE -- [ MUMMBLES ] AND HE STARTS TALKING TO ME. AND I PICK OUT A FEW THINGS, LIKE I HEAR THE WORD LIKE BUTTER AND LAUGHING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. HE COMES AT ME FOR A FULL MINUTE OF FRENCH.

Jimmy: I NEED JOHN TRAVOLTA IN THAT MOVIE FOR ME TO WATCH IT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ AS TRAVOLTA ]
Jimmy: I CAN'T BELIEVE I LIKE SANDY. YOU GOT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT.
I LOVE IT SO MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I NEED. MY TRAVOLTA.
THEY'RE BOTH SO GOOD. YOU'VE GOT TO DO THAT AND WE'LL COME BACK AND --
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD, ALL RIGHT. I'LL WATCH IT. I'LL GIVE MY REVIEW. I'LL BE HONEST. I'M PROBABLY WRONG. BUT THIS IS ON HIS CHRISTMAS LIST.

Jimmy: DO YOU KNOW RUSSIAN NOW? LIKE AFTER --
SO WELL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ARE YOU AWFUL AT IT?
I'M SO BAD. AND I JUST KEEP BEGGING THE PRODUCERS. I SAY, "I HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN AT HOME." LIKE, I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LEARN RUSSIAN. GIVE IT TO THE WELSHMAN WHO'S ALSO IN THE SHOW. LIKE, LET HIM DO IT.
Jimmy: LET MY COSTAR DO THE RUSSIAN PART.
HE HAS NO CHILDREN!
Jimmy: YOU'RE LIKE, "I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LEARN RUSSIAN."
I DON'T HAVE TIME AND I'D BE SO BAD. I'D BE SO BAD.
Jimmy: REALLY? YOU WOULDN'T BE A GOOD SPY AT ALL?
I'D BE A TERRIBLE SPY. THERE'S LIKE -- THERE'S WIGS INVOLVED. THERE'S TONS OF LIKE --
Jimmy: HOW MANY WIGS DO YOU HAVE?
SO MANY WIGS. AND WE NAME THEM ALL. YOU KNOW, "RECORD GIRL" AND "BAD ANNIE." AND WE HAVE THIS ONE THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS SORT OF LIKE FELICITY HAIR? LIKE, BIG FELICITY HAIR.

Jimmy: IT SHOULD HAVE IT'S OWN TWITTER ACCOUNT. FELICITY HAIR. FELICITY HAIR SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN TWITTER ACCOUNT.
AND SO, WE HAVE THIS WHOLE THING WHERE WE MAKE ALL THE CREW MEMBERS AND ALL THE MALE CAST PUT ON THE WIG BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S SO FUNNY. AND WE TAKE PICTURES OF THEM WEARING THE FELICITY WIG.
Jimmy: EVERYBODY WEARING THE FELICITY WIG. NOW, IS THIS IS A WALL, LIKE, IN THE MAKEUP TRAILER?
IT'S A FELICITY WALL. YEAH, THIS IS BEHIND PEG'S STATION, WHO DOES OUR HAIR. LIKE, THERE'S WILLA, MY DAUGHTER, WEARING IT.
Jimmy: NO WAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
NOAH AND RICK, RIGHT THERE, WEARING IT.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? WHAT'S COOL IS THAT YOU BROUGHT THE WIG.
WE BROUGHT THE WIG. AND WE WERE WONDERING IF YOU WANTED TO BE PART OF OUR FELICITY WALL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT WOULD BE AN HONOR. I WOULD LOVE TO. I WOULD LOVE TO. SO, CAN YOU --
YEAH, WE HAVE IT. ALSO, I THINK IT WOULD LOOK GREAT ON YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Jimmy: THIS IS ME IN HIGH SCHOOL.

Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S SO GOOD. I MEAN, IT LOOKS REALLY NICE ON EVERYONE, BASICALLY. AND OH, OH, OH WOW. THAT LOOKS SO GOOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NOW, NOW -- YEAH, JUST SHAKE IT OUT. MAKE IT FULL A LITTLE. NOW --
Jimmy: I WANT TO TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER ON A DATE. [ LAUGHTER ] OR WHATEVER. ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT'S THE POSE I HAVE TO DO?
NOW YOU HAVE TO DO THIS POSE WHERE YOU KIND OF SIDE --
