Questlove: 644! YEAH.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: HELLO, EVERYONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND WELCOME, EVERYONE. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE. I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS, YOU GUYS. I READ THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP STILL DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO PASS THE REPUBLICAN HEALTH CARE BILL TOMORROW. [ SCATTERED CHEERS ] THEN ANOTHER GUY SAID -- [ PUTIN IMPRESSION ] OKAY, HOW MANY DO YOU NEED THIS TIME? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YES, I CAN DO IT. ACTUALLY A A BIG STORY TODAY CAME OUT THAT TRUMP'S FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER PAUL MANAFORT WORKED FOR A A RUSSIAN BILLIONAIRE AND HELPED PROMOTE PUTIN'S AGENDA. MANAFORT QUIT WHEN HE REALIZED HE COULD JUST WORK FOR AN AMERICAN BILLIONAIRE AND ACHIEVE THE SAME THING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHY NOT? AND GET THIS, IT TURNS OUT PAUL MANAFORT WAS PAID $10 MILLION TO ADVOCATE FOR PUTIN. TRUMP WAS FURIOUS. HE SAID, THAT'S MORE THAN HE PAYS ME. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE NEGOTIATED. THE WHOLE THING'S PRETTY SURPRISING BECAUSE MANAFORT WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT KIND OF THING A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND HIS DENIAL WAS PRETTY CONVINCING. TAKE A LOOK.
SO TO BE CLEAR, MR. TRUMP HAS NO FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH ANY RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS?
IF THAT'S WHAT HE SAID -- THAT'S WHAT I SAID. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WHAT THEIR -- OUR POSITION IS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GOOD -- GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. THAT WAS GOOD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AT HIS WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING TODAY, SEAN SPICER WAS ASKED ABOUT MANAFORT'S TIES TO RUSSIA, AND PUTIN, AND IT GOT PRETTY TESTY. CHECK THIS OUT.
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT AWARE OF PAUL'S CLIENTS FROM THE LAST DECADE.
NOW ALL THIS IS COMING OUT AND --
YOU KNOW, BUT WHAT ELSE IS COMING OUT? WHAT ELSE DON'T WE KNOW? I MEAN, WHERE HE WENT TO SCHOOL? WHAT GRADES HE GOT? WHO HE PLAYED WITH IN THE SANDBOX. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHO HE RODE THE SEESAW WITH. IF HE WAS JUST LIKE ME AND SAT ON ONE END WAITING TO MAKE A A FRIEND. I MEAN, THERE'S PLENTY WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM. IF HE WENT TO PROM BY HIMSELF. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE NEIL GORSUCH STARTED HIS CONFIRMATION HEARINGS THIS WEEK AND HE SAID THAT HE HAS HIS LAW STUDENTS THINK ABOUT THEIR LEGACIES BY HAVING THEM WRITE AN OBITUARY ABOUT THEMSELVES. [ AUDIENCE GROANS ] YEAH. INCIDENTALLY THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE REPUBLICAN HEALTH CARE PLAN. WHICH I THINK -- [ APPLAUSE ] MORBID.
Steve: A BAD IDEA, YEAH.
Jimmy: THEY SHOULD TAKE THAT OUT.
Steve: YEAH, WHY WOULD YOU PUT THAT IN THERE?
Jimmy: I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA. OF COURSE SENATORS ASKED GORSUCH SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS. THEY EVEN THROUGH IN SOME WEIRD ONES. LISTEN TO THIS GUY.
MY SON DALLEN, TEENAGER, SAID ASK HIM IF HE WOULD RATHER FIGHT 100 DUCK SIZE HORSES OR ONE HORSE-SIZE DUCK? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. YEAH. AND THEN 12 HOURS LATER THERE WAS THIS ONE.
MY WIFE ALSO SENT ME A TEXT A LITTLE BIT AGO AND SAID -- AND I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T EXPECT ME TO READ IT, BUT, HOW IN THE WORLD IS GORSUCH ABLE TO GO SO MANY HOURS AT A TIME WITHOUT PEEING? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I THINK GORSUCH WAS LIKE, YEAH. "WITHOUT" PEEING. HA-HA-HA-HA. HA-HA-HA-HA. [ APPLAUSE ] TRUMP WAS LIKE, JUST WHAT I NEED, ANOTHER LEAKER. I CAN'T HAVE IT. I CAN'T HAVE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FIND OUT WHO IT IS. TODAY GORSUCH SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO PROVE THAT HE WOULDN'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. BUT THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. LISTEN TO HIM TALK ABOUT THE FOUNDING FATHER, JOHN HANCOCK. WATCH THIS.
BUT THEY KNOW THAT THAT'S HIS SIGNATURE, BECAUSE HE WROTE HIS NAME SO BIGLY -- BIG AND BOLDLY.
YOU JUST SAID BIGLY.
BIGLY -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE SAID BIGLY. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. THEN GORSUCH PULLED OFF HIS MASK AND WAS LIKE, I FOOLED YOU! IT WAS ME ALL ALONG! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "SCOOBY DOO!" MEDDLING KIDS. I SAW THIS WEEK, TRUMP'S KIDS, DON JR., IVANKA AND ERIC TOOK THEIR FAMILIES ON A SKI TRIP TO ASPEN. WHICH WAS FUN 'TIL THEY SAID, WAIT. IF WE'RE ALL HERE WHO'S WATCHING DAD? UH, LET'S GO. GET ON A PLANE RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] EVERYONE GET YOUR STUFF. HE MIGHT BE TWEETING RIGHT NOW! WELL, THIS IS EVERYWHERE. LAST NIGHT ON "WHEEL OF FORTUNE" A CONTESTANT WAS DOWN TO THE FINAL LETTER ON A PUZZLE AND IT SEEMED LIKE A SURE THING. BUT CHECK OUT HOW IT WENT.
$600.
