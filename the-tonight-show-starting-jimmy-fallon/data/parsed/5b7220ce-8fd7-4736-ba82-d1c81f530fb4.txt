Jimmy: YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THOSE GUYS.
LET ME GET TO IT. THERE'S A THIRD ONE THERE THAT I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT. SO, BUT THEY'RE TELLING STORIES ABOUT HIM, IT'S NOT SO MUCH A A SPEECH. AND I'M LIKE, OH, GOD, MAYBE THIS IS A LITTLE -- I HAVEN'T KNOWN MATTHEW THAT LONG. I DON'T HAVE THAT MANY STORIES. AND WHILE I'M THINKING ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY, THEY'RE LIKE, "ONE SECOND." UP POPS A CLIP OF SANDRA BULLOCK.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW ANYBODY, YOU ESPECIALLY DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW SANDRA BULLOCK. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. SHE'S PERFECT.
Jimmy: SHE'S AMERICA'S SWEETHEART. SHE'S PERFECT, I KNOW.
SHE'S PERFECT BECAUSE SHE'S CUTE AND SHE'S FUNNY AND SHE'S JUST EVERYTHING. AND SHE'S LIKE NOT THERE AND SHE'S LIKE WEARING NO MAKEUP AND GOT THIS ADORABLE HAT ON.
Jimmy: OH, GOSH.
AND SHE WROTE A POEM. AND THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR 22 YEARS. AND THEN LIKE, SHE FINISHES THE POEM AND THEN SHE CUTS TO DOING IT IN FRONT OF A BUNCH OF MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY FANS. IT WAS SO THOUGHTFUL. THEN THEY WERE LIKE, "OKAY. GO." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN TO ME?
AND I WAS JUST LIKE, OH, MY GOD. SO I THOUGHT, OKAY, JUST GET IT TOGETHER. YOU CAN DO THIS. YOU'VE WRITTEN A SPEECH. IT'S NOT AS FUNNY AS THE OTHER GIRLS BUT IT'S HEARTFELT. YOU CAN DO IT. I GO TO SAY MY FIRST LINE, THE TELEPROMPTER BROKE. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS LIKE, YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH.
SO, I TRIED TO GIVE THIS SPEECH. THE TELEPROMPTER'S LIKE COMING IN SOMETIMES, IT'S NOT THERE. AND EVENTUALLY I JUST DECIDED, YOU KNOW, TO WING IT AND I JUST TOLD A STORY. AND IT WAS OKAY.
Jimmy: WAS IT EMBARRASSING?
MM-HMM.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT WAS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WELL, IT WAS EMBARRASSING, BUT THE THING ABOUT ME AND EMBARRASSMENT IS YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT IT ALL HAPPENS ON A SCALE. AND SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT EMBARRASSMENT, SCALE OF ONE TO TEN.
Jimmy: OKAY.
ONE IS JUST LIKE BEING A A PERSON WALKING DOWN THE STREET. AND TEN IS FOR ME CO-HOSTING THE OSCARS WITH JAMES FRANCO. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHICH, BY THE WAY -- WHICH IS ONLY TIED WITH HAVING BEING HONORED TO ACCEPT AN OSCAR WHILST WEARING A DRESS THAT I KNEW MADE IT LOOK LIKE MY NIPPLES WERE ERECT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I FORGOT ABOUT THAT ONE.
SO HERE'S THE THING, IF THAT'S A TEN?
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT WAS LIKE A FOUR.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU CAN GET THROUGH THAT.
I CAN HANDLE THAT.
Jimmy: YOU CAN HANDLE THAT ONE. I FORGET ABOUT THAT DRESS. THAT'S THE BEST.
I CAN'T FORGET ABOUT IT. IT HAUNTS ME STILL.
Jimmy: IT HAUNTS ME TO THIS DAY. WHAT WAS THE McCONAUGHEY STORY? DO YOU HAVE A GO-TO STORY FOR HIM?
WELL, THE STORY WAS THAT I HAD -- HE INVITED, HE AND HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE CAMILLA, WHO'S BY THE WAY A BOMBSHELL INSIDE AND OUT, HAD INVITED US TO A A PARTY AND WE GOT THE DATE WRONG. AND SO I SHOWED UP THE DAY LATER WHICH IS THE DAY AFTER THE PARTY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT ONE WAS LIKE AN EIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU WENT THE DAY AFTER. HEY, MAN.
BUT HERE'S THE THING. THE PART OF THE STORY I DIDN'T TELL AT THE CINEMA TECH AWARDS WAS IT WAS THE SECOND TIME I HAD GOTTEN THE DATE WRONG.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I HAD PUT IT -- I GOT THE INVITE, PUT IT INTO MY CALENDAR AND THEN REMEMBERED IT WRONG. SO, I THOUGHT IT WAS A SUNDAY. I JUST ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A A SUNDAY. MY HUSBAND AND I WOKE UP THIS SUNDAY MORNING AND WE'RE TIRED, AS YOU ARE, WE WANTED TO SPEND THE DAY AT HOME. COME ON, MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY PARTY, LET'S GO. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
Jimmy: OH YEAH, YOU CAN'T TURN DOWN THAT PARTY.
AND I LOOK AT MY PHONE. HONEY, THE MOST WONDERFUL THING. IT'S NEXT WEEK. LOOK, IT'S NEXT SUNDAY. AND MY HUSBAND GOES, "THANK GOD YOU CHECKED. CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW HORRIBLY EMBARRASSING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF WE WOULD HAVE JUST SHOWED UP AT THE McCONAUGHEY'S HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SUNDAY WHEN THERE WAS NO PARTY GOING ON?" AND I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, THAT WOULD BE THE WORST THING OUTSIDE OF CO-HOSTING THE OSCARS WITH JAMES FRANCO." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THEN --
THEN IT HAPPENED.
Jimmy: YOU DID IT. WHAT DOES HE DO? DOES HE ANSWER THE DOOR --
OH, HE WAS THE BEST. HE KNEW HOW BAD I FELT. AND HE INVITED US IN.
Jimmy: WERE YOU DRESSED AND READY FOR A PARTY?
WELL, NO, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS A MIDDLE OF A SUNDAY. SO I DIDN'T GO TOO, TOO DRESSED UP. HE WAS NOT DRESSED UP, BUT HE INVITED US IN.
Jimmy: HE JUST NEVER WEAR CLOTHES, RIGHT?
HE WAS SO NICE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS CLOTHED.
Jimmy: HE ANSWERS THE DOOR IN LIKE A SARONG.
I'VE ONLY EVER SEEN HIM IN CLOTHES. I'VE ONLY EVEN SEEN HIM IN CLOTHES.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
HE INVITED US IN, GOT US DRUNK. AND WE HAD A GREAT TIME. AND I GATE CRASHED A SURPRISE PARTY WITH HIM.

Jimmy: AND YOU -- IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I'M SAYING THERE'S BEAUTIFUL SHOTS OF SPACE. CLEARLY, YOU DIDN'T SHOOT IT IN SPACE, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THAT YET.
Jimmy: SORRY ABOUT THAT. SEE, MY BRAIN'S GOING A LITTLE CRAZY.
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
BECAUSE THE STORY IS ABOUT A A FATHER/DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP. AND YOU'RE A NEW FATHER. DID IT GET TO YOU THERE?
Jimmy: DUDE, YEAH, I CRIED.

Jimmy: MORE THAN A HUNDRED DAYS IN JAIL.
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.
Jimmy: RELEASING A TAPE OF JUST A A JOURNALIST MAKING IT. BUT THEN THIS SCENE WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOW IS ACTUALLY TRUE. THIS REALLY HAPPENED.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THEY THINK THAT HE'S SPYING?
THEY ACCUSED HIM OF SPYING, YEAH.
Jimmy: THEY ACCUSED HIM OF SPYING BY DOING A BIT ON "THE DAILY SHOW." WHICH ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN. IN REAL LIFE, IT HAPPENED. BUT IT'S CLEARLY A JOKE WHEN WE SEE IT IN AMERICA BECAUSE HE'S WEARING GLASSES AND HE'S WEARING A TRENCHCOAT. LIKE, IT WAS A BIT. CLEARLY, IT'S A FUNNY JOKE IN AMERICA BUT OVER THERE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS REAL. THEY THOUGHT HE WAS TALKING TO A SPY.
YEAH, THEY USED IT AS PART OF THE EVIDENCE.
Jimmy: PART OF THE EVIDENCE. IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE. AND THE STORY IS JUST -- YOU GOT TO WATCH THIS TO BELIEVE THAT IT REALLY HAPPENED. UNBELIEVABLE. WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. GAEL GARCIA BERNAL IN "ROSEWATER."
SIR, YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. I'M A JOURNALIST, THAT'S IT. NOTHING MORE.
JUST A JOURNALIST?
YES.
AS A SPY, I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY YOUR COUNTRY IS SO TERRIFIED.
THE FIRST THING TO KNOW ABOUT IRAN IS THAT IT IS NOT EVEN. AMERICANS AND IRANIANS HAVE A A LOT OF THINGS IN COMMON. MORE THAN THEY HAVE DIFFERENCES.
WHAT DO I HAVE IN COMMON WITH YOU?
SO, CAN YOU TELL ME WHY JUST A JOURNALIST MET UP WITH THIS AMERICAN SPY?
HE IS NOT A SPY.
HE'S NOT A SPY?
NO, IT IS A SHOW.
IT'S A SHOW?
A COMEDY SHOW. IT'S STUPID.
IT'S VERY STUPID, YES.
HE'S A COMEDIAN PRETENDING TO BE A SPY.
SO, CAN YOU TELL ME WHY AMERICAN PRETENDING TO BE A SPY HAS CHOSEN TO INTERVIEW YOU?
AND WHY WOULD A REAL SPY HAVE A TV SHOW? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
