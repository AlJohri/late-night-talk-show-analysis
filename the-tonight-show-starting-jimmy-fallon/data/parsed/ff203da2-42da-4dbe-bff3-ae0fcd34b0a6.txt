Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY, GUYS! THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THIS IS THE HOT SHOW. THIS IS THE SHOW THAT YOU WANT TO BE AT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. JEB BUSH IS FACING A POTENTIAL SCANDAL. AFTER HE RELEASED THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS FROM HIS TIME AS GOVERNOR THAT CONTAINED INFORMATION LIKE ADDRESSES, PHONE NUMBERS AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. I THINK THE REAL QUESTION IS, WHO THE HELL SIGNS AN E-MAIL WITH THEIR ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT'S WRONG WITH PEOPLE? I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS. I'M GOING TO ADD MY ATM PIN CODE, TOO. MY MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME IN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] JEB BUSH IS IN TROUBLE AFTER HE RELEASED THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS THAT CONTAINED SENSITIVE INFORMATION. WELL, THEY'VE GONE NOW BACK AND REDACTED LOTS OF PRIVATE INFORMATION. BUT I THINK SOME OF THE MESSAGES ARE STILL TOO REVEALING. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN. HERE'S AN E-MAIL JEB RECEIVED IN 2006. "THANK YOU FOR YOUR PURCHASE OF BLANK, THE LITTLE BLUE PILL THAT WILL GIVE YOU A A LONG-LASTING BLANK. IF YOUR BLANK LASTS MORE THAN FOUR HOURS, CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR." YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I KNEW -- I COULD GUESS WHAT HE'S SAYING.
Steve: YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT.
Jimmy: HERE'S ONE HE SENT IN 2004. "JUST TOOK MY WIFE TO A A ROMANTIC DINNER AT APPLE BLANK'S AND I ACCIDENTALLY CLOGGED THE BLANK AFTER EATING 40 CHICKEN BLANKS." I MEAN --
Steve: WHAT? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I SEE WHERE -- FINALLY, HERE'S AN E-MAIL JEB SENT IN 2006. "WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND FOUND THE DOG BLANKING THE BLANK OUT OF ONE OF THE COUCH CUSHIONS. IT KEEPS HAPPENING. NOT SURE WHAT TO DO. MY BROTHER BLANK W. BLANK USED TO DO THE SAME THING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS NICE. GEORGE H.W. BUSH POSTED A PHOTO OF HIS SON JEB AS A BABY WITH FOOD ALL OVER HIS FACE AND WISHED HIM A HAPPY BIRTHDAY OVER TWITTER YESTERDAY. IT'S REALLY CUTE. CAN WE SEE THE PHOTO? LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S A CUTE BABY, MAN. IS IT ME OR IS SOMETHING IN THE BACKGROUND? CAN WE ZOOM IN ON THE BACKGROUND THERE? [ LAUGHTER ] EW, WHOA. HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN 60-YEARS-OLD?
Steve: I DON'T KNOW. FOR ABOUT 50 YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS NEW BOOK BY FORMER OBAMA STRATEGIST DAVID AXELROD. IN THE BOOK, AXELROD SAID OBAMA LIED TO AMERICANS TO GET VOTES IN 2008 WHEN HE SAID HE OPPOSED GAY MARRIAGE EVEN THOUGH HE REALLY DIDN'T. WELL, WE WERE CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT ELSE THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN DISHONEST ABOUT. SO, WE ACTUALLY CREATED A A SPECIAL LIE DETECTOR THAT CAN ANALYZE THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENTS.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: YEAH. WE USED "THE TONIGHT SHOW" BUDGET. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: YOU SHOULD GIVE SOME OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO THE GOVERNMENT. I MEAN, THIS IS GOOD TECHNOLOGY.
Jimmy: NO, NO, LET'S JUST SEE IF IT WORKS. I DON'T KNOW.
I BELIEVE AS STRONGLY AS EVER THAT WE SHOULD TAKE ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. [ DING ] I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT TO MAINTAIN A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET. [ DING ] IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN DELAWARE. [ BUZZER ] [ LAUGHTER ] I BELIEVE OUR DEMOCRACY IS STRONGER WHEN THE PRESIDENT ACTS WITH THE SUPPORT OF CONGRESS. [ DING ] I WOULD ENJOY HAVING SOME KENTUCKY BOURBON WITH MITCH McCONNELL. [ BUZZER ] [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVE MERYL STREEP. [ DING ] LET ME TELL YOU THE REASON I PICKED JOE BIDEN. NUMBER ONE, HE CAN STEP IN AND BECOME PRESIDENT. [ BUZZER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE'VE GOT TO WORK OUT THE KINKS. BUT YOU GET IT. THE IDEA IS THERE. WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] DID YOU SEE THIS? DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH RYAN SEACREST YESTERDAY, KANYE WEST REVEALED THAT VOICES IN HIS HEAD TOLD HIM TO GO UP ON STAGE AND INTERRUPT BECK DURING THE GRAMMYS. YEAH. WHAT'S MORE REVEALING IS EVEN THE VOICES IN KANYE'S HEAD ARE AUTOTUNED. ♪ BECK DIDN'T DESERVE THAT AWARD ♪ ♪ BEYONCE DESERVES EVERYTHING EVERYTHING EVERYTHING EVERYTHING ♪ [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GUYS, A LITTLE CONTROVERSY HERE. A LITTLE CONTROVERSY. THIS WEEK, A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN CHICAGO WAS STRIPPED OF ITS WORLD SERIES TITLE AFTER IT WAS REVEALED THEY FAKED A MAP TO GET BETTER PLAYERS FROM DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS. YEAH. THEN, NICOLAS CAGE SAID, "WAIT, THAT MEANS THE REAL MAP IS STILL OUT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE GOT TO GET THE BASEBALL DIAMOND AND FIND OUT." [ APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF BASEBALL, ONE OF THE BEST PARTS ABOUT SPRING TRAINING IS THE FANTASY CAMPS THAT THEY HAVE WHERE ANYONE CAN SIGN UP AND PLAY AGAINST FORMER PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS. YOU KNOW THESE THINGS. EVEN THOUGH THE GAMES ARE JUST FOR FUN, TENSIONS CAN STILL RUN PRETTY HIGH. CHECK OUT THIS GUY. HE'S 88-YEARS-OLD. HE GETS BRUSHED OFF THE PLATE BY A HIGH PITCH. WATCH THIS.
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU LOU DUNLAP. HE'S 88-YEARS-OLD. HE'S AT THE ROCKIES FANTASY CAMP. AND YOU DON'T BUZZ THE TOWER AND EXPECT SWEET LOU TO JUST LET THAT GO LIGHTLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'VE GOT TO SAY. I GOT TO SAY, A-ROD LOOKS GREAT. I MEAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN A A WHILE. HE LOOKS GREAT. THE GUY WAS LIKE, "YOU THINK I CAN'T TAKE YOU? I BEAT DEATH EVERY DAY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TO BE FAIR, A GUY THAT AGE EXPECTS HIS BALLS TO BE WAY LOWER.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HEY-OH!
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. LAST TIME SOMETHING GOT THROWN AT HIS HEAD, IT WAS A GERMAN HAND GRENADE.
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS. [ LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, GUYS, WITH ALL THE SPECULATION ABOUT 2016, MANY POTENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE STARTING TO PLAY IT SAFE. MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT CHRIS CHRISTIE WAS ACTING VERY QUIET DURING A TRIP TO IOWA THIS WEEK TO HELP BALANCE HIS NOTABLY BLUNT AND DIRECT PERSONALITY. THAT MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE ODD. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CHRISTIE'S BEEN SAYING RECENTLY, IT'S HARD TO DISAGREE. WHEN ASKED HOW HE THINKS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BEEN DOING IN 2015 SO FAR, CHRISTIE SAID, "FINE." [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED WHAT HE AND HIS WIFE ARE DOING FOR VALENTINE'S DAY, CHRISTIE SAID, "STUFF." [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED WHAT HE WANTS FOR LUNCH, CHRISTIE SAID, "A SIRLOIN STEAK COOKED MEDIUM WELL WITH CHICKEN CHEESE ENCHILADAS AND A SIDE OF CHEESE FRIES, SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIP AND A LOADED BAKED POTATO WITH BACON BITS! NOW!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, YOU GUYS. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME. IT'S BEEN A GREAT WEEK SO FAR. THERE'S MORE AHEAD. TOMORROW NIGHT, SAMUEL L. JACKSON WILL BE HERE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S IN A FUN MOVIE. WE'LL TALK TO COLIN LATER. PLUS, FROM "THE WALKING DEAD," NORMAN REEDUS WILL BE DROPPING BY. THAT'S TOMORROW. NORMAN AND I ARE GOING TO PLAY A SPECIAL "WALKING DEAD" EDITION OF FACE BREAKERS. SO, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT. AND WE HAVE MUSIC FROM JESSIE J. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THAT. [ APPLAUSE ] JESSIE J.'S AWESOME. BUT FIRST WE HAVE A FANTASTIC SHOW TONIGHT. FROM THE NEW ACTION MOVIE "KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE," COLIN FIRTH IS JOINING US.
Steve: WHOA! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT'S FUN. IT'S A FUN MOVIE.

Jimmy: JACK McBRAYER AND TRIUMPH THE INSULT COMIC DOG. NOW, IF YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW, TRIUMPH, HE'S AN INSULT COMIC. OKAY? THERE AREN'T MANY OF THEM OUT THERE. BUT WHAT HE DOES IS HE INSULTS PEOPLE. HE MIGHT INSULT ME. HE MIGHT INSULT THE ROOTS. IT'S ALL IN GOOD FUN. HE MIGHT INSULT THE AUDIENCE.

THEY ALSO GIVE OUT AWARDS BEFORE THE GAME SORT OF LIKE THE ONES IN HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOKS LIKE "MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED," "CLASS CLOWN," STUFF LIKE THAT. SO, WITH THAT IN MIND, IT'S TIME FOR "TONIGHT SHOW SUPERLATIVES." HERE WE GO. ♪ TONIGHT SHOW SUPERLATIVES ♪
