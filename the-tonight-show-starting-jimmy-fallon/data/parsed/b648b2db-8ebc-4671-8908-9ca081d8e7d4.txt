ITS ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE CROWD.

Jimmy: YOU WENT ON THIS THING, AND IT LOOKED INTENSE.
IT WAS INTENSE.
Jimmy: ROCK CLIMBING.
I LIKE HIS SHOW "MAN VERSUS WILD." AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO GO ON. 'CAUSE I NEVER REALLY WENT CAMPING OR ANYTHING SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN - -
Jimmy: ME NEITHER.
REALLY?
Jimmy: DO YOU LIKE CAMPING?

Jimmy: HE HAS A TV SHOW AFTER ALL.
BUT HE'S VERY POSITIVE AND HE'S VERY INSPIRATIONAL, BUT HE REALLY DOES MAKE YOU DO EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN. AND WHEN YOU START OUT, THE FIRST NIGHT WE WENT TO THE ISLE OF SKYE IN SCOTLAND AND WE STAYED IN A LITTLE B AND B THE NIGHT BEFORE, AND HE GOT A NICE LITTLE SWAG BAG, BEAR GRYLLS BACKPACK, BEAR GRYLLS KNIFE, BEAR GRYLLS CANTEEN.
Jimmy: STUFFED ANIMAL. BEAR GRYLLS STUFFED ANIMAL.
CUT TO 12 HOURS LATER AND YOU'RE ON THE SIDE OF A A 800 FOOT CLIFF AND YOU'RE MUDDY AND COLD, AND JUST WONDERING HOW THE EVENTS OF YOUR LIFE LED YOU TO THIS PLACE.
Jimmy: FOR REAL.
YEAH. AND THEN IT JUST KIND OF -- AND THERE'S EIGHT PEOPLE WHO ARE FILMING IT. THERE ARE LIKE CAMERAMEN AND SOUND PEOPLE. SO, WHILE YOU'RE FROZEN ON THE SIDE OF THE CLIFF THEY'RE SCAMPERING ACROSS THE CHASM TO GET A SHOT. THEY DON'T CARE. THEY'RE LIKE SUPER INTO IT. THEY DO IT.
Jimmy: THEY DO THIS ALL THE TIME. YOU'RE BEN STILLER.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU'RE AN ACTOR AND COMEDIAN. YOU DON'T CLIMB ROCKS.
EXACTLY. WE RAPPELLED DOWN THE SIDE OF THIS CLIFF ONE DAY, AND THEN THE NEXT MORNING WE HAD TO GO BACK UP IT. AND THERE WAS THIS TECHNIQUE CALLED "JUMARING." I THINK IT'S CALLED, "JUMARING." THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. IT'S A NAVY S.E.A.L. TECHNIQUE. SO YOU'RE GONNA PUT YOUR FOOT IN THE LITTLE STIRRUP, AND THEN YOU PULL YOURSELF UP WITH YOUR BODY WEIGHT AND PUT YOUR OTHER FOOT IN AND YOU CLICK IT. IT'S THIS SORT OF THING THEY USE TO GET UP ON OIL RIGS AND STUFF. AND IT IS -- LIKE AFTER ABOUT 4 1/2 FEET, I HIT THE WALL. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I HAD ABOUT 85 FEET TO GO. AND I STARTED TO GET DRY MOUTH, RIGHT? AND I'M LIKE, OH, OKAY, I'VE GOT MY BEAR GRYLLS CANTEEN. CAN I HAVE A -- "NO WATER, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!" WHY DID YOU GIVE ME THE BEAR GRYLLS CANTEEN IF I CAN'T HAVE WATER? AND WHAT DOES NOT HAVING WATER HAVE TO DO WITH BELIEVING IN MYSELF?
Jimmy: I BELIEVE THAT I'M THIRSTY.
YEAH, SO IT WAS -- EXACTLY.
Jimmy: CAN I SHOW -- WE HAVE A PHOTO HERE. THAT'S YOU.
THAT'S ME EXACTLY AT THAT POINT 4 1/2 FEET UP, WHEN I RAN OUT OF STEAM. [ LAUGHTER ] Jimmy: HE'S STANDING ON THE GROUND AND YOU'RE BARELY UP THERE, YEAH. AND YOU COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
I'M NOT KIDDING.
Jimmy: YOU'RE YELLING FOR THE CANTEEN.
I'M SAYING, "GIVE ME THE CANTEEN." BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
Jimmy: BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
Jimmy: BUT LOOK AT THIS. I GO, "THIS IS INSANE."
IT TOOK ABOUT THREE HOURS -- IN THE SHOW IT'S ABOUT FOUR MINUTES. BUT IN REAL LIFE, IT WAS THREE HOURS.
Jimmy: THAT'S INSANE. THAT'S SCARY. IT WASN'T SCARY WHEN -- I WAS HOLDING THE PICTURE. THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE. YOU'RE ON AN ISLAND SOMEWHERE YOU'RE DOING A PUB CRAWL. YOU'RE DOING A PUB CRAWL.
THE OLD BATMAN TECHNIQUE.
Jimmy: THE OLD BATMAN TECHNIQUE. YEAH, EXACTLY. YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT. ARE YOU AN ADVENTUROUS GUY IN GENERAL?
I'M A SEMI-ADVENTUROUS GUY. I LIKE TO GO -- I GET INTO SITUATIONS, WELL, LIKE I'LL TRY SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND THEN IT GETS A LITTLE MORE INTENSE THAN I NECESSARILY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE. I'VE GOT A FRIEND -- ACTUALLY, THE FRIEND WHO WAS IN THE BAND LAST TIME, CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, MY FRIEND CHRIS, HE STARTED THE BAND AS A KID IN HIGH SCHOOL --
Jimmy: HE'S THE PUNK.
AND HE GOT US INTO CRAZY SORTS OF SITUATIONS. HE'D TAKE US TO THE UNDERGROUND, THE RAILROAD TRACKS, AND WE'D BE OUT THERE AND THEN A TRAIN WOULD BE COMING. AND WE SAY, "WHAT DO WE DO?" HE GOES, "I DON'T KNOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS FAR BEFORE."
Jimmy: SO WHY DID YOU BRING US HERE?
YEAH. SO WE RECONNECTED WITH THE BAND WHEN THE ALBUM THING HAPPENED. HE SAID, "LET'S GO HAVE A KAYAK TRIP ON THE EAST RIVER." BECAUSE HE DOES URBAN SPELUNKING.
Jimmy: WHAT IS THAT?
URBAN SPELUNKING? IT SOUNDS LIKE A FETISH OR SOMETHING.
Jimmy: IT SOUNDS LIKE A A PLACE TO GET COOL HIP CLOTHES.
IT'S LIKE, GOING AND FINDING NOOKS AND CRANNIES IN THE CITY WHERE PEOPLE DON'T GET TO AND EXPLORING THEM. SO HE SAID, "MEET ME UNDER THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE AND WE'LL GO KAYAKING." WE GET TO THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE, I GOT THERE, AND IT'S -- I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A DOCK OR LIKE A KAYAK RENTAL PLACE. LIKE CENTRAL PARK.
Jimmy: YEAH.
NO. IT'S LITERALLY JUST SHORELINE, BARREN SHORELINE AND HE'S PUMPING UP AN INFLATABLE KAYAK.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. NO, NO, NO. I LOVE THIS GUY.
JUST ONE. IT WAS A TWO-MAN KAYAK. IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF LIKE A A CANOE THAT I WOULD IMAGINE THE DUTCH SETTLERS TRADED WAMPUM IN.
Jimmy: I KNOW THE EXACT DRAWING IN MY HEAD.
IT'S A VERY BUSY WATERWAY, THE EAST RIVER. THERE'S WATER TAXIS AND ALL SORTS OF, YOU KNOW, BIG BOATS. AND WE GET OUT THERE. AND IT'S JUST -- HE SAID, "AT TIMES WE'RE GOING TO HIT SLACK TIDE AT THE MID- POINT OF OUR TRIP AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK WITH THE -- I'M LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYING.
Jimmy: SLACK TIDE?
WE START GOING AND THERE'S WAVES, AND THE WATER TAXIS GO BY AND WHEN THE WATER TAXIS GO BY THERE'S LIKE A WAKE THAT COMES. SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING WHEN YOU'RE ON A A BRIDGE. BUT WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA LEVEL, WHEN A WAKE IS COMING AT YOU IT'S LIKE THIS GIANT WALL OF WATER, LIKE THIS KIND OF TSUNAMI AND WE'RE LIKE IN OUR LITTLE INFLATABLE KAYAK. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M ALSO LIKE -- IT'S NOT LIKE YOU WANT TO GET EAST RIVER WATER IN YOUR FACE OR MOUTH.
Jimmy: NOT THE HEALTHIEST. NOT THE BEST. IT'S NOT EVIAN GETTING SPRAYED ON YOU. YEAH.
SO I'M LIKE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WAKE GETS TO US? HE'S LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW, I'VE NEVER GOTTEN THIS FAR."
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. I'M BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL. WELL, THIS MOVIE, IT KIND OF GOES THAT WAY. "WHILE WE'RE YOUNG."
YEAH. YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S KIND OF YOU AND NAOMI WATTS KIND OF WANT TO GET INTO THIS YOUNGER THING.
WE'RE A COUPLE IN OUR 40's THAT ARE LIKE KIND OF IN A RUT AND WE MEET THIS COUPLE IN THEIR 20's. THIS YOUNG BROOKLYN COUPLE THAT ADAM DRIVER AND AMANDA SEYFRIED PLAY, AND THEY SORT OF INVIGORATE OUR RELATIONSHIP AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE IN THEIR 20's AND PEOPLE IN THEIR 40's.
IT'S REALLY FUNNY. AT SOME POINT, SAD, BECAUSE YOU GO "DON'T DO THAT, IT'S SO NOT COOL, YOU'RE IN YOUR 40's."
IT'S THAT WEIRD THING POINT OF GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I'M NOT THE YOUNG ONE. I'M THE ONE WHO'S ACTUALLY WHAT I THOUGHT MY PARENTS WERE AT ONE POINT.
Jimmy: IT'S FANTASTIC. AND WHO KNOW WHO'S GREAT? ADAM HARVICK.
YEAH. ADAM HARVICK.
Jimmy: AD ROCK, FROM THE BEASTIE BOYS, IS IN IT AND HE'S UNBELIEVABLE.
HE'S LIKE ONE OF OUR HIDDEN TREASURES AS AN ACTOR. I GUESS BEING A BEASTIE BOY ALL THESE YEARS, HE DIDN'T GET TO EXPLORE HIS ACTING CAREER. AND HE'S INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: FANTASTIC. I HAVE THE CLIP. IT'S VERY FUNNY. HERE'S BEN STILLER IN "WHILE WE'RE YOUNG." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

[ LAUGHTER ] I JUST APPLIED FOR THAT THING, GLOBAL ENTRY, SO YOU CAN GET INTO CUSTOMS A LITTLE BIT QUICKER. YOU KNOW, THEY JUST DO A A BACKGROUND CHECK. YOU'VE DONE, THAT RIGHT? [ RUSSIAN ACCENT ].
Jimmy: YES, YES. OF COURSE. I'VE DONE THAT MANY, MANY TIMES. YOU'VE BEEN THERE, GLOBAL ENTRY.
THAT'S AN INTERESTING ACCENT.
Jimmy: YOU WENT THERE. YOU WENT THERE. IS THAT RIGHT?
IT SEEMS TO COME VERY EASILY TO YOU THAT ACCENT.
Jimmy: YOU WERE THERE -- YOU WERE THERE, PROBABLY HUH?
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF SOMEBODY OFFERED YOU MONEY TO GIVE SOME SECRETS AGAINST YOUR COUNTRY. YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT, WOULD YOU?
Jimmy: THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU LOVE YOUR COUNTRY MORE THAN ANYTHING, DON'T YOU? [ DING ] MAN, I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. JIMMY FALLON HOSTING "THE TONIGHT SHOW." IT'S THIS WHOLE COOL NEW THING WITH VIRAL VIDEOS AND STUFF. SO GOOD, MAN. YOU ARE SO COOL. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
Jimmy: NUMBER ONE MOVIE MADE. THAT LAST MOVIE MADE -- TEN YEARS TO MAKE THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] THAT'S REALLY EXCITING. YOU'RE GREAT. GOT A GREAT WIFE.
Jimmy: YOU'VE GOT A GREAT WIFE.

Jimmy: TIM GUNN.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
Jimmy: YES.
WHAT YOU JUST DID WITH BEN STILLER WAS SO HILARIOUS. I'M NOT GOING TO REVISIT SEXUAL TENSION, THOUGH I COULD. [ LAUGHTER ] RATHER OBSEQUITY. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT IS SUCH A THRILL TO BE HERE WITH YOU. THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS THE LAST WEEK OF "THE LATE SHOW." AND WHAT I LOVE SO MUCH IS THAT YOU BROUGHT SO MUCH OF THE SHOW WITH YOU. YOU HAVE THE ROOTS, YOU HAVE MR. HIGGINS, AND YOU HAVE THIS BRAND NEW SET, AND I FEEL LIKE I'M IN LATE NIGHT HEAVEN.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S TRUE. AND YOU KNOW, I COLLECT ARCHITECTURAL MODELS. SO FOR ME THIS REALLY IS HEAVEN.
Jimmy: I MEAN -- ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?
IT'S SPECTACULAR.
Jimmy: OH, PETER BARRON, THE DESIGNED OUR SET AND ALL THIS BEAUTIFUL STUFF. EUGENE LEE. THESE GUYS ARE BRILLIANT GUYS. WE'RE JUST HAPPY TO BE -- IT'S THE SAME ROOM THAT LATE NIGHT WAS IN.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: THEY JUST CLASSED IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
WELL -- IT COMES FROM THE TOP.
Jimmy: NO, PLEASE. HEY THIS MIGHT BE A FIRST EVER. ARE YOU WEARING -- ARE YOU WEARING THE SUIT THAT YOU'RE ON THE COVER OF --
I DID IT ON PURPOSE. IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.
Jimmy: THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED. THAT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW" HISTORY. WE JUST MADE "TONIGHT SHOW" HISTORY. IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS. [ APPLAUSE ]
I HAVE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SUIT THOUGH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THE FIRST TIME I WORE IT WAS IN LOS ANGELES. AND I WAS WALKING FROM MY APARTMENT TO A SET. WE WERE TAPING A SHOW CALLED "UNDER THE GUNN." AND IT WAS EARLY MORNING. AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO ONE ON THE SIDEWALKS IN LOS ANGELES EVER. THERE WERE THREE OF US.
Jimmy: YOU DRIVE SOMEWHERE TO WALK.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW I KNOW A A GREAT PLACE TO WALK IN L.A. TALK THE 101 TO THE 3 AND THEN YOU GET OUT AND WALK. GREAT PLACE TO WALK.
MAYBE BUT THE COUPLE BEHIND ME DID JUST THAT. THERE WAS A COUPLE BEHIND ME. WE WERE STOPPED AT A LIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JAYWALK EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO TRAFFIC. AND SHE SAID TO HIM, "HONEY," POINTING TO ME IN MY SUIT, "I WISH YOU'D DRESS MORE LIKE THAT GUY." AND THERE WAS A PAUSE, AND HE SAID, "YOU MEAN LIKE AN [ BLEEP ] HOLE? [ LAUGHTER ] SO I CALL THIS MY [ BLEEP ] HOLE SUIT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WRONG. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. YOU DOPE, THAT'S TIM GUNN. YOU'RE THE BEST DRESSER. AND GOSH, I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR A A LONG TIME NOW. WE DID THE EMMY THING OPENING --
THAT WAS HILARIOUS.
Jimmy: I'LL EVER FORGET THAT. THANK YOU FOR DOING ME THAT FAVOR.
ARE YOU KIDDING? YOU DID ME A FAVOR. THAT WAS JUST -- IT WAS A A BLAST.
Jimmy: YOU ALWAYS GIVE ME TIPS ON THINGS YOU GO -- AND WOMEN OUT THERE AS WELL. WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE. FASHION DON'TS. A COUPLE DON'TS. YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU TONIGHT. ONE DON'T IS --
EVERYONE, THE BARE MIDRIFF. REALLY? IS ANYONE OUT THERE WEARING ONE? I HOPE NOT. I MEAN, IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT, THE MODEL ON THE RIGHT IN WHITE, I MEAN AT LEAST IT'S -- WELL, THERE'S A DEGREE OF SUBTLETY, BUT ALSO THE LOOK IS BELIEVABLE. BUT THIS PERSON, THIS POOR PERSON HERE.
Jimmy: PROBABLY A NICE PERSON. LOOKS LIKE SHE FELL OFF A A MOTORCYCLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE WENT INTO A BLENDER OR GARBAGE DISPOSAL.
Jimmy: IN A GOOD WAY.
IT'S ONLY IN A GOOD WAY. BUT I ALSO HAVE TO SAY THAT WITH ME WITH FASHION THERE'S ONE SUREFIRE WAY OF LOOKING RIDICULOUS AND THAT'S IF YOU'RE TRYING TOO HARD. AND THIS IS SOMEONE WHO'S SIMPLY TRYING TOO HARD.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE LITTLE TIPS, YOU GUYS. THE OTHER ONE IS THIS ONE. THIS IS INTERESTING. I DON'T KNOW --
OH. WELL, THERE ARE TWO THINGS HAPPENING HERE. ONE IS COLOR BLOCKING, WHICH IS VERY ON TREND. AND THE OTHER IS CLOTHES WITH MORE VOLUME. THE FASHION INDUSTRY AND THE RETAIL INDUSTRY WANT IT TO SWING LIKE A PENDULUM. SO MORE FITTED CLOTHES HAVE BEEN IN AND NOW OF COURSE EVERYTHING IS VOLUMINOUS. NOT EVERYTHING BUT MANY THINGS. AND THIS IS --
Jimmy: AGAIN, GORGEOUS. LIKE A BACON AND FRIED EGG? [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. BUT WHAT I FIND INTERESTING IS ACROSS HER KNEE IS WRITTEN "POO." [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THAT SAYS IT ALL.
Jimmy: THAT SAYS IT ALL RIGHT THERE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYMORE. YOU DID IT, YEAH. POO, GOSH YEAH -- TREAT YOURSELF WITH RESPECT. I ALWAYS APPRECIATE THESE TIPS. AND I LOVE THE BOOK. AND THERE'S ALWAYS SOME MENTORING IN HERE TEACHING. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE ON THE SHOW AND YOU'RE COMING, YOU'RE GOING MAKE IT WORK. AND BY THE WAY, I LOVE THE TITLE, "THE NATTY PROFESSOR."
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: I'M A BIG NUTTY PROFESSOR FAN.
WELL, THAT'S WHERE IT CAME FROM OF COURSE.
Jimmy: I KNOW. I LOVED IT.
AND YOU'RE IN THE BOOK TOO, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YOU SAY VERY NICE THINGS ABOUT ME.
WELL, WHO WOULDN'T?
Jimmy: WELL, YOU DON'T SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT EVERYBODY IN HERE.
NO, I DON'T. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DO YOU GET IN TROUBLE FOR THAT?
YOU KNOW, I OWN RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT I SAY. AND IF I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY IT I WOULDN'T AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO PUT IT IN PRINT. PEOPLE SAY TO ME WITH SOME FREQUENCY, AREN'T YOU AFRAID NO ONE WILL ASK YOU TO A PARTY AND WILL NEVER ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING? AND I SAY, "YEAH." IT WON'T DISAPPOINT ME ONE BIT.
Jimmy: YOU REALLY DON'T YEAH. BUT YOU SAY VERY NICE THINGS ABOUT ME, AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS WILL BE. PLEASE COME BACK. MORE AND MORE "TONIGHT SHOW."
THANK YOU. IT'S AN HONOR.
