I JUMPED OFF THE STOOP PRETENDING I WAS BATMAN, LIKE HE CAN FLY, HE CAN'T BUT -- I JUMPED OFF AND RIPPED THE VINYL SUIT COMPLETELY ALL THE WAY OUT THE BACK. IT WAS LIKE I WAS WEARING TWO CAPES. [ LAUGHTER ] THE WORST COSTUME EVER. I GUESS YOU'RE SORT OF BATMAN? YOU'RE BATMAN CHANGING INTO HIS OUTFIT? IT WAS REALLY SAD FOR ME. BUT THEN WHEN I WATCHED THE MOVIE LIKE THIS, I GO, THIS GUY'S DOING IT UP. HE'S LIVING THE DREAM.
THIS IS IT.
Jimmy: I MEAN THIS IS IT. WERE YOUR PARENTS INTO SUPERHEROES GROWING UP?
YEAH, MY DAD IS LIKE A A HUGE -- FAN BOY. HE COLLECTS "STAR WARS" ACTION FIGURES. YEAH, IF YOU GO INTO HIS BASEMENT, IT'S LIKE LITERALLY LINED CEILING TO FLOOR WITH "STAR WARS" ACTION FIGURES. AND IT'S GOT PRINCESS LEIA DARTBOARD. IT'S LIKE THE FULL DEAL.
Jimmy: ARE THE ACTION FIGURES OPENED OR UNOPENED?
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON THE ACTION FIGURE. YOU KNOW LIKE SOME HE'S LIKE I JUST WANT TO LIKE -- I NEED TO TAKE IT OUT OF THE BOX. NEVER EVER -- LIKE NEVER IN A A MILLION YEARS.
Jimmy: YOUR DAD MUST HAVE FREAKED OUT WHEN HE FOUND OUT YOU WERE GOING TO BE THE GREEN GOBLIN.
HE WAS REALLY EXCITED AND THE FIRST THING HE SAID ACTUALLY WAS, THE GUYS FROM MY COMIC BOOK CLUB ARE GOING TO BE SO EXCITED WHEN I TELL THEM THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT IS FANTASTIC. THAT IS SO FUN. THE GUYS IN MY COMIC BOOK CLUB. OH, MY GOD. WHERE DO THEY HOLD THOSE MEETINGS?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
Jimmy: IT'S UNDERGROUND IN A A CAVE SOMEWHERE.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: YOU HAD TO BULK UP FOR THIS RIGHT? YOU HAD TO TRAIN --
YEAH, I WAS REALLY SKINNY WHEN WE STARTED. I WAS 135 POUNDS. I WAS LIKE REALLY, REALLY LIGHT SO I GAINED LIKE 20 POUNDS FOR THE ROLE.
Jimmy: COOL STUFF. AND HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
THEY LIKE FEED -- THEY GIVE YOU PLATES OF FOOD THAT YOU EAT EVERY TWO HOURS. AND IT'S JUST LIKE MOUNDS OF VEGETABLES AND PROTEIN BITS, BY THE END I WAS EATING 5500 CALORIES A DAY.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS. JUST LEAN AND PROTEIN.
VEGGIES.
Jimmy: FOR HOW LONG?
FOR I GUESS 8 OR 9 MONTHS.
Jimmy: DOES THAT DRIVE YOU CRAZY OR WHAT?
WELL, IT'S OKAY YOU KNOW I MEAN -- PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS LIKE, IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO HARD -- GETTING IN THE GREEN GOBLIN MAKE-UP, IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO HARD EATING ALL THAT FOOD. BUT IT'S LIKE COME ON, PEOPLE, I'M THE GREEN GOBLIN. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S THE COOLEST THING EVER LIKE -- WHO CARES IF YOU HAVE TO EAT A A LOT TO BE THE GREEN GOBLIN.
Jimmy: EXACTLY. WERE YOU ALLOWED TO EAT LIKE -- CAN YOU GO OUT AND GET A A HAMBURGER OR SOMETHING?
WELL, OKAY, SO. FUNNY YOU SHOULD MENTION IT.
Jimmy: WHY, YOU CHEATED?
OKAY, SO ONE DAY -- ACTUALLY, MY TRAINER WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, ARE YOU HAVING CHEAT MEALS? I WAS LIKE, "NO, MAN, I'M DOING IT." HE'S LIKE "WOW, YOU'VE BEEN GOING FOR FOUR MONTHS. YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LET GO A A LITTLE BIT." SO MY WIFE AND I WENT TO BRUNCH. AND I ORDERED A BURGER AND IT WAS MY FIRST BURGER IN LIKE FOUR MONTHS AND I TOOK A BITE OF IT AND I LITERALLY STARTED CRYING IN THE RESTAURANT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU LOVED IT THAT MUCH?
SHE WAS LIKE, WHAT'S WRONG? I WAS LIKE, IT'S JUST SO DELICIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SHE'S LIKE, HONEY, YOU GOTTA GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER, BUDDY.
STOP CRYING, YOU'RE EATING A A BURGER. EATING A HAMBURGER. OH MY GOSH.
Jimmy: I COULD NEVER DO OR THINK EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT DIET. BUT INSTEAD, I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP HERE OF YOU IN THE "AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2" BEFORE YOU BECOME GREEN GOBLIN.
YES --
Jimmy: IT WAS NOT A SPOILER, PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU DO -- BECOME GREEN GOBLIN?
WELL, THEY DO NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW THE CLIP, BUT BEFORE WE SHOW THE CLIP, I GOT TWO OF THE BEST BURGERS THEY SERVE HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, SHAKE SHACK. IF YOU CAN HAVE A BITE. YOU CAN SEE IT A LITTLE BIT. IT'S SHAKE SHACK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HAD THESE YET.
I HAVE HAD SHAKE SHACK.
Jimmy: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE RIGHT?
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
Jimmy: GET READY, DANE'S GONNA START CRYING YOU GUYS. HERE'S DANE DEHAAN IN "SPIDER MAN 2." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
I'M GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
ALL RIGHT, BUT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
