BUT BY THE END OF THE SHOW, IT WAS JUST, IT WAS GREAT FUN. BECAUSE THE AUDIENCE WAS SO FANTASTIC. THEY WERE DOING THE WORK. WE JUST HAD TO TURN UP ON THE NIGHT.
Jimmy: REALLY? THAT MUST HAVE BEEN SO GOOD. CAN WE -- ARE WE ABLE TO SEE THAT AT ALL?
I THINK THERE'S A DVD COMING OUT FAIRLY SHORTLY OF THE SHOW. YEAH, I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO THERE'S ONE THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE SHOW, IT'S CHEAPER, NOT VERY GOOD. WAIT UNTIL NOVEMBER, WHEN THE GOOD ONE COMES OUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHEN THE MONEY REALLY GOES UP.
WHEW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PAL, AND WHEN DID YOU HAVE TIME TO DO -- I GUESS THE "THE ZERO THEOREM"? WHEN DID YOU DO THAT?
OH, THAT WAS YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND HEALTHY.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT WAS LAST YEAR.
Jimmy: IT'S A BIG PROJECT. I LIKE --
IT BEGAN AS A BIG PROJECT. IT BECAME A MUCH CHEAPER BIG PROJECT. OF COURSE. YEAH, YEAH, I DON'T WANT DO REVEAL THE COST, BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL THINK IT'S NOT VERY GOOD OR ELABORATE. OR EXPENSIVE MOVIE.
Jimmy: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO WATCH.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
Jimmy: IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
BUT WE DID IT FOR A FRACTION OF WHAT THE ORIGINAL PRICE WAS. AND BASICALLY RELYING ON FRIENDS LIKE MATT DAMON, TILDA SWINTON AND BEN WHISHAW. PEOPLE LIKE THAT COMING IN TO WORK FOR SCALE, BASIC SCALE.
Jimmy: AND CHRISTOPH.
OH, CHRISTOPH, HE'S EXTRAORDINARY.
Jimmy: HE'S A GREAT ACTOR. WE HAVE A CLIP, HERE'S CHRISTOPH WALTZ IN "THE ZERO THEOREM".
THE RENT MUST BE OUTRAGEOUS.
ACTUALLY, WE OWN THE BUILDING. WE BOUGHT IT FROM AN INSURANCE COMPANY. SOME YEARS AGO. THERE HAD BEEN EXTENSIVE FIRE DAMAGE. THE PREVIOUS OCCUPANTS WERE AN ORDER OF MONKS. SWORN VOWS AND CHASTITY, POVERTY AND -- SILENCE. APPARENTLY NO ONE BROKE THE SILENCE TO YELL "FIRE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AND THAT. IT'S GOOD. WHO IS THAT? THAT ACTRESS IS PHENOMENAL.
SHE'S A FRENCH ACTRESS NAMED MELANIE THIERRY, AND SHE'S NEVER DONE A PART LIKE THAT. WHEN SHE MET, SHE'S A GREAT ACTRESS. AND I SAID THINK OF TWO WOMEN, THINK OF MARILYN MONROE AND THINK OF JUDY HOLLIDAY, FOR THOSE WHO REMEMBER JUDY HOLLIDAY, A GREAT COMEDIAN AND FILM STAR. AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S DONE AND SHE TRANSFORMED HERSELF AND WE ALL JUST FELL DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH HER AND HER LATEX. [ LAUGHTER ]
