THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. GUYS, HERE'S THE LATEST ON THE ELECTION. DONALD TRUMP IS ACTUALLY TAKING A BREAK FROM THE CAMPAIGN TO GO VISIT HIS GOLF RESORT IN SCOTLAND TOMORROW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH. RIGHT AFTER HE LEAVES THE U.S., REPUBLICANS WILL SAY, "QUICK! BUILD THE WALL!" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, A BIG STORY THIS WEEK IS THAT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN ISN'T DOING SO WELL FINANCIALLY. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] A RECENT REPORT, YEAH. THEY SAID HIS CAMPAIGN EVEN SPENT OVER $100,000 FOR MEALS JUST LAST MONTH. AND TRUMP SAID, "WELL, THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR HIRING CHRIS CHRISTIE." AND YOU GO, WELL THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY, HO!
Jimmy: COME ON, MAN.
Steve: HEY!
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT A NICE THING TO SAY.
Steve: IS THAT TRUE? IS THAT WHAT HE --
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT A NICE THING TO SAY.
Steve: THAT'S NOT NICE AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND GET THIS. HILLARY CLINTON GAVE A SPEECH YESTERDAY WHERE SHE TALKED ABOUT EMPLOYMENT. SHE SAID THAT NOT EVERY JOB REQUIRES A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE. AND THIS YEARS GRADUATES SAID, "THIS IS THE WORST COMMENCEMENT SPEECH EVER! [ LAUGHTER ] I'M FINALLY GRADUATING! WHERE WERE YOU LAST YEAR?" [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, BERNIE SANDERS STILL HASN'T OFFICIALLY DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT, BUT EARLIER TODAY, HE GAVE A SPEECH WITH THE THEME "WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?" [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK HE WAS BASICALLY ASKING THE CROWD FOR DIRECTIONS BACK TO VERMONT. IT'S JUST LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: YEAH. [ AS BERNIE ]
Jimmy: "WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? YOU MAKE A LEFT AND THEN YOU GET --" OF COURSE, THE OTHER MAIN STORY IS THAT DEMOCRATS HELD A BIG SIT-IN ON THE HOUSE FLOOR TO PROTEST CONGRESS' REFUSAL TO VOTE ON GUN CONTROL. OR IN OTHER WORDS, DEMOCRATS WERE TIRED OF CONGRESS NOT GETTING ANYTHING DONE, SO THEY REFUSED TO GET ANYTHING DONE UNTIL SOMEONE GOT SOMETHING DONE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT. THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT. AND THIS IS REALLY BIG. TODAY, THE UNITED KINGDOM HELD A VOTE ON WHETHER TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR BECOME INDEPENDENT. I SAW THAT AS PEOPLE HEADED TO THE POLLS, TORRENTIAL RAINS FLOODED LONDON'S STREETS AND DISRUPTED ITS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AS OPPOSED TO OUR ELECTION WHICH WILL BE FLOODED BY FROGS AND LOCUSTS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "THIS IS IT! THIS IS THE BIG ONE!"

HE JUST RECENTLY GAVE A A "60 MINUTES" INTERVIEW TO DISCUSS HIS RETIREMENT AND FOOTBALL CAREER AND LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE GAME.
THAT'S WHEN IT JUST CLICKED IN MY MIND THAT IF YOU JUST RUN THROUGH SOMEBODY FACE, A LOT OF PEOPLE AIN'T GON' BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER. AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AGAIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER. ♪♪ I MEAN, AT ONE POINT HE WAS LIKE, "WHAT WAS THE QUESTION? I'M SORRY. I FORGOT."

Steve: OH.
Jimmy: I MEAN, WE ARE.
Steve: GREAT!
Jimmy: WE ARE DOING 60 MINUTES BUT --
Steve: 60 MINUTES IN LENGTH. NOT THE SHOW "60 MINUTES."
Jimmy: THAT IS CORRECT. AND THE SHOW "60 MINUTES" IS STILL CALLED "60 MINUTES."
Steve: IT'S NOT CALLED "64 MINUTES."
Jimmy: THAT WAS A SHOW I MADE IN THE MONOLOGUE AND IT WAS JUST A JOKE.
Steve: SO THERE WEREN'T SNAKES IN THE BOOTS OF THAT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YES THERE WERE SNAKES IN THE BOOTS.

Jimmy: WE'LL TALK ABOUT TAKING A SELFIE LATER. YOU MIGHT BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT I KNOW BESIDES ME WHO WATCHED THE MOVIE "THE MAN ON THE MOON" MORE TIMES THAN ME. I LOVED THAT -- REESE WITHERSPOON. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT MOVIE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S MY JAM. I WATCHED IT ALL THE TIME. I WATCHED IT -- I WORKED AT A A VIDEO STORE AND I USED TO RENT IT ALL THE TIME.
IT'S AMAZING, YEAH. MY GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME TO WATCH THAT BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT THAT I LOOKED LIKE REESE WITHERSPOON.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I WAS LIKE, WELL THAT'S AWESOME, AND I WATCHED IT WHEN I WAS 14, I WATCHED IT EVERY NIGHT FOR THREE MONTHS IN THE SUMMER, AND ACTUALLY BACKSTAGE MY BOYFRIEND HAD JUST TEXTED COURT FOSTER.

Jimmy: THEY'RE FANTASTIC. BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS, THEY HAVE DIFFERENT ACTING TECHNIQUES.
YES, SLIGHTLY. I THOUGHT THAT I WAS AN OLSEN TWIN WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT I WAS ASHLEY OLSEN AND MY SISTER WAS MARY KATE. AND I WATCHED EVERY MOVIE AND I WOULD, YOU KNOW, REPEAT WHAT THEY DID IN THEIR FILMS IN MY AUDITIONS, AND I WAS, LIKE, 10 OR 11 AND ONE THING THEY DO IS -- LIKE, MARY KATE FRIENDS AND SHE WOULD BE LIKE, HI, I'M RILEY. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, THERE'S ALWAYS A LAUGH AT THE END AND I WAS LIKE, THAT'S AMAZING. MY GOD! SO I WAS LIKE, AUDITIONING FOR THIS REALLY HEAVY LIKE KEVIN COSTNER FILM AT 11 AND I WAS SAYING ALL THESE LINES. AND I WAS DOING A -- AFTER EVERY TIME BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.
Jimmy: SHE'S GOING TO LOVE THIS. SHE'S GOING TO LOVE THIS.
