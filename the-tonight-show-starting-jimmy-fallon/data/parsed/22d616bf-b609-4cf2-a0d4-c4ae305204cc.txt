THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I APPRECIATE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LOOKING GOOD. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. TONIGHT IN HOUSTON, TEXAS, THERE WAS YET ANOTHER REPUBLICAN DEBATE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EVEN THE PEOPLE ON "GREY'S ANATOMY" WERE LIKE, "HOW LONG DOES THIS GO ON?" [ LAUGHTER ] IS IT OVER? [ APPLAUSE ] TONIGHT WAS THE TENTH REPUBLICAN DEBATE. YOU CAN TELL THE CANDIDATES ARE GETTING BORED UP THERE 'CAUSE AT ONE POINT THEY TOOK TURNS PRANK CALLING JEB BUSH. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. IT WAS FUNNY. BUT CRUEL. THAT'S RIGHT, THERE WAS ANOTHER DEBATE, I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF TOPICS BUT THIS ONE WAS "BATMAN VERSUS SUPERMAN." "ON ONE HAND, BATMAN IS AN ECCENTRIC BILLIONAIRE JUST LIKE ME, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, SUPERMAN IS SUPER JUST LIKE ME." [ LAUGHTER ] INTERRESTING DEBATE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LAST NIGHT, JOHN KASICH SAID HIS FAVORITE PRESIDENT WAS GEORGE WASHINGTON -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT FOREVER BUT STEPPED DOWN AFTER TWO TERMS. WHILE TRUMP SAID HIS FAVORITE PRESIDENT WAS GEORGE WASHINGTON 'CAUSE HE ALSO WORE A FANTASTIC WIG. [ LAUGHTER ] [ GROWLING ] DOWN BOY, DOWN BOY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MITT ROMNEY RECENTLY ACCUSED TRUMP OF HAVING A BOMBSHELL IN HIS TAX RETURNS, THEN TRUMP RESPONDED BY TWEETING THAT ROMNEY BLEW AN ELECTION. YEAH, DONALD TRUMP IS FIGHTING WITH MITT ROMNEY. EVEN THE OSCARS WE'RE LIKE, THAT'S JUST TOO WHITE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S TOO MUCH.
Steve: COME ON. WE DON'T NEED IT.
Jimmy: THAT'S TOO WHITE. IN A NEW INTERVIEW, DONALD TRUMP'S WIFE, MELANIA, SAID THAT SHE SPEAKS ENGLISH, ITALIAN, FRENCH AND GERMAN. WHICH IS GOOD 'CAUSE IF SHE EVER BECOMES FIRST LADY SHE'LL NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR HER HUSBAND IN AT LEAST THOSE FOUR LANGUAGES. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'LL COME IN HANDY. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: GOOD START.
Jimmy: IT'S A GOOD TALENT TO HAVE. SOME MORE ELECTION NEWS. THE SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY IS SATURDAY AND HILLARY CLINTON HOLDS A A DOUBLE-DIGIT LEAD OVER BERNIE SANDERS IN THE STATE.

Steve: COLONEL SANDERS.
Jimmy: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DIDN'T THINK OF THAT EARLIER. AND HILLARY CLINTON APPEARED ON THE "STEVE HARVEY SHOW" YESTERDAY. AND SHE SAID SHE PREFERS THIN CRUST PIZZA TO DEEP DISH PIZZA. YEAH. WHEN ASKED WHAT HER FAVORITE TOPPINGS ARE, HILLARY WAS LIKE "I WILL RELEASE MY FAVORITE TOPPINGS WHEN ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES RELEASE THEIR FAVORITE TOPPINGS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OKAY? FAIR IS FAIR. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS. FACEBOOK JUST LAUNCHED SOME NEW REACTION BUTTONS. [ CHEERS ] THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE EMOJIS BUT INSTEAD ONLY HAVING THE OPTION TO LIKE SOMETHING, PEOPLE CAN REACT TO POSTS WITH LOVE, WOW, HAHA, ANGRY. IT'S PRETTY GOOD START. BUT WE HAVE A FEW OTHER SUGGESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE EVEN MORE HELPFUL. TAKE A LOOK. FIRST THERE'S, "WE GET IT, YOU'RE ENGAGED." [ LAUGHTER ] BIG DEAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT WE HAVE THE, OH, GOOD, ANOTHER 18 PARAGRAPH POST ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: SCROLL, SCROLL.
Jimmy: AND FINALLY THERE'S, "DAMN, DANIEL." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: DAMN, DANIEL. IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT, JUST GOOGLE IT. IT'S FUNNY. FINALLY A NEW MOVIE ABOUT POWER LINE WORKERS CALLED "LIFE ON THE LINE" JUST RELEASED ITS FIRST TRAILER AND IT LOOKS GREAT. THE MOVIE LOOKS GREAT. THERE'S ONE SMALL PROBLEM. THE TRAILER SPELLS KATE BOSWORTH'S NAME WRONG. THIS IS REAL. SEE HOW THEY SPELL IT. LOOK AT THIS. KATE BOSEWORTH. PUT AN "E" IN IT. THAT'S PRETTY BAD, RIGHT? BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE ONLY THING THEY GOT WRONG. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS TRAILER IT GOT WORSE FROM THERE.
GET READY FOR THE YEAR'S MOST MOVING DRAMA STARRING KATE BOSWORTH. ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE, SHARON STONE. AND GOLDEN GLOBE WINNER, JOHN TRAVOLTA. SEE THE FILM CRITICS ARE CALLING TRIUMPHANT AND FLAWLESS. "LIFE ON THE LINE."
