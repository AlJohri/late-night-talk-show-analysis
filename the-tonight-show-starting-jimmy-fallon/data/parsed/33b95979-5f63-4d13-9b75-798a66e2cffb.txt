FLORIDA SENATOR AND POTENTIAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MARCO RUBIO JUST GAVE AN INTERVIEW WHERE HE REFUSED TO REVEAL IF HE'S EVER SMOKED POT. [ LAUGHTER ] HE SAID, HE WON'T ANSWER BECAUSE IT'S A BIG DEAL IF HE SAYS YES. AND IF HE SAYS NO, PEOPLE WILL THINK HE'S LYING. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, IN OTHER WORDS, HE DEFINITELY SMOKED POT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S THE WEED DUDE, NOW.

Jimmy: PATRICK, YOU'RE HITTING ON THE WRONG ANDY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT THE BACHELORETTE. HE'S NOT THE BACHELORETTE. WHEN THE BACHELORETTE CAME IN, THESE GUYS ARE LIKE, "UGH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S DISGUSTING."
Steve: FORMULA ONE.
Jimmy: SO, OF COURSE, LAST NIGHT WAS WHEN THE BACHELORETTE MEETS ALL THE GUYS. THEY GET OUT OF THE LIMO AND THEY RUN OVER AND THEY HAVE THEIR SCHPEAL. SHE MEETS ALL THE GUYS FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT SEEMED LIKE SHE KEPT TELLING THEM ALL THE SAME THING. WATCH.

THIS ISN'T GOOD, I SAW THAT CNN HAD TO FIRE AN EDITOR AFTER DISCOVERING THAT SHE ACTUALLY PLAGIARIZED 50 STORIES. NOT GOOD. CNN WAS LIKE, "CAN YOU IMAGINE SOMEBODY ACTUALLY SAW THEM? [ LAUGHTER ] WE WOULD BE IN TROUBLE." ACTUALLY, THERE'S TROUBLE OVER AT FOX NEWS AS WELL.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WELCOME TO THE SHOW, BUDDY.
I THOUGHT I WAS JUST HERE FOR THE CHARADES.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. THANK YOU FOR PLAYING CHARADES.
I WAS PSYCHED. WE KILLED THEM.
Jimmy: WE KILLED THEM. THAT LAST TEN POINT ROUND WAS FANTASTIC.
11-2. THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.
Jimmy: 11-2, NOT EVEN CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. I APPRECIATE IT. I HAVE GOT TO SAY, BECAUSE -- GOSH, YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN A FAN. I MET YOU YEARS AGO. I HAD BEEN A FAN OF YOU. AND THEN YOU DID "BLACK HAWK DOWN," "PEARL HARBOR" -- THESE GIANT, GIANT, TENT POLE MOVIES. AND THEN YOU MOVED HOME TO MINNESOTA.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU JUST SAID, "OH, I'M JUST GOING TO MOVE HOME."
I DID.
Jimmy: AND YOU LIVED THERE FOR 18 MONTHS. I MEAN, WAS IT WEIRD MOVING HOME?
IT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD AT FIRST. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I WAS DOING THESE BIG MOVIES, AND THEN DECIDED TO GO HOME AND SEE MY HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS. AND IT WAS SORT OF A A DIFFERENT -- OBVIOUSLY, PEOPLE WERE TREATING ME A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY WHEN WE WENT OUT IN PUBLIC, BUT --
Jimmy: WHAT MAKE YOU DO YOU DO THAT?
TO BE AROUND PEOPLE THAT I KNEW REALLY WELL WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD WAS KIND OF COMING IN AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS ALL ABOUT. I JUST FELT LIKE I WANTED TO BE AROUND PEOPLE WHO KNEW ME.
Jimmy: YEAH. SO, YOU WENT HOME AND SAW YOUR HIGH SCHOOL BUDDIES?
JUST WENT FISHING FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. MINNESOTA IS KNOWN FOR ITS FISHING.
Jimmy: AND YOU JUST HUNG OUT IN THE SAME AREA THAT YOU HUNG OUT WHEN YOU WERE A KID GROWING UP?
PARTIALLY. YEAH, I WROTE A SCRIPT IN THAT TIME TOO. SITTING ON A VERY IMPORTANT SHELF SOMEWHERE AT DREAMWORKS.
Jimmy: YEAH, SOMEWHERE. YEAH, YEAH. BUT YOU GOT TO SEE MOM?
YEAH, A LITTLE, YOU KNOW, HOME COOKED MEAL NEVER HURT ANYBODY.
Jimmy: DID SHE TREAT IT LIKE YOU WERE BACK IN SCHOOL?
I WAS LIKE ABOUT FOUR YEARS FROM WHEN I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL TO WHEN I FINISHED DOING "BLACK HAWK DOWN." AND THAT WAS ABOUT THE TIME THAT WE MET. AND THEN ALL OF MY OTHER FRIENDS WERE GRADUATING FROM UNIVERSITY. AND SO IT WAS KIND OF LIKE COMING HOME AFTER SCHOOL AND WONDERING, "OKAY, WHAT NEXT," IN A WAY. EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR THEIR FIRST JOBS. AND I'D ALREADY -- [ WHISPERING ] CONQUERED THE BOX OFFICE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. SO, MR. BIG SHOT COMES HOME.
YEAH.
Jimmy: EXACTLY, RIGHT. BUT THEN I HEARD THIS, AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TRUE OR NOT. DID YOU DATE YOUR HIGH SCHOOL GIRLFRIEND FOR A LITTLE BIT?
I DID, YEAH.
Jimmy: AGAIN?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WE GOT BACK TOGETHER FOR QUIET A WHILE.
Jimmy: YOU NEED TO TELL ME ABOUT THIS! THIS IS FANTASTIC! THIS IS -- HOPEFULLY -- IS THIS A SCRIPT? THAT'S A SCRIPT!
MY CURRENT GIRLFRIEND IS GOING TO WATCH THIS.
Jimmy: NO, YOUR CURRENT GIRLFRIEND IS THE BEST. SHE IS THE GREATEST. I LOVE HER SO MUCH. BUT, EVERYONE STARTS SOMEWHERE, AND -- [ LAUGHTER ] NO, BUT I'M SORRY. I'M GOING TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE.
YEAH!
Jimmy: DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR A SCRIPT? GUY, BIG MOVIE STAR, COMES HOME TO HIS HOMETOWN AND --
YOU WITH DREW BARRYMORE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PERFECT CAST.
Jimmy: I CAN TOTALLY DO THIS.
YOU COULD.
Jimmy: IF ONLY MY ACTING WERE GOOD, I COULD TOTALLY DO THIS.
OH, COME ON, JIMMY. JIMMY HELD ME UP THROUGH "SNL." LIKE, I WAS SO TERRIFIED. I WAS SHAKING LIKE A LEAF THE WHOLE TIME.
Jimmy: YOU WERE NOT SHAKING LIKE A LEAF.
YEAH, I WAS.
Jimmy: HERE IS ME AND YOU HOSTING "SNL." WE WERE DRESSED AS 'N SYNC IN THE NEW "STAR WARS" MOVIE. I WAS JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE. YOU WERE J.C. AS I BELIEVE.
I WAS J.C.
Jimmy: I REMEMBER PRACTICING DANCING WITH YOU. AND WE WERE LIKE, "DUDE, WE'RE AWFUL."
IT WAS SO TOPICAL AT THE TIME, WASN'T IT?
Jimmy: IT WAS A RUMOR 'N SYNC WAS GOING TO BE IN THE NEW "STAR WARS." THEY WERE CHARACTERS, AND THAT WAS A BIG RUMOR.
SO WHO IS GOING TO BE IN THE NEW ONE? THEY'RE DOING ANOTHER ONE NOW. IT'S GOING TO BE CYCLICAL.
Jimmy: IT'S ONE DIRECTION. [ LAUGHTER ] HARRY STYLES IS THE NEW LUKE SKYWALKER.
TOTALLY.
Jimmy: I'VE READ ALL THE BLOGS. I HAVE GOT TO SAY, "PENNY DREADFUL," THIS THING LOOKS FRIGHTENING TO ME, AND SCARY. AND IT IS A LITTLE SCARY AND FRIGHTENING, BUT IT'S SET IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND OR -- WHAT IS IT ABOUT? DID YOU TELL ANYONE?
I COULD TELL YOU -- BUT DON'T TELL ANYONE ELSE.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST BETWEEN ME AND YOU, BUDDY. YEAH, YEAH.
SO IT IS SET IN 1 1891 IN LONDON, AS YOU SAID. AND IT INVOLVES A LOT OF CHARACTERS FROM CLASSIC HORROR LITERATURE. AND IT SORT OF, KIND OF, SUPPOSES THAT THEY ALL LIVE IN THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME, AS REAL PEOPLE. FRANKENSTEIN'S THERE. DRACULA IS THERE. DORIAN GRAY IS THERE. AND I PLAY THIS AMERICAN CHARACTER WHO IS VERY MYSTERIOUS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S THERE OR WHY HE STICKS AROUND WHEN ALL OF THESE SORT OF SUPERNATURAL, SCARY THINGS START HAPPENING. AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE SHOW, TO FIND OUT.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, THERE YOU GO. GOSH, IT'S A BIG HIT. SO CONGRATULATIONS. SHOWTIME IS LIKE FREAKING OUT ABOUT IT. IT'S GREAT. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S JOSH HARTNETT IN "PENNY DREADFUL." TAKE A LOOK.
