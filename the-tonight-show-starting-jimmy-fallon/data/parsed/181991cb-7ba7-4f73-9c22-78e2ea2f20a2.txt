WELL, HERE'S WHAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT. MEGYN KELLY'S BIG PRIMETIME INTERVIEW WITH DONALD TRUMP AIRED EARLIER TONIGHT. YES. KELLY SAID SHE WANTED TO KEEP THINGS RESPECTFUL AND PROFESSIONAL AND TRUMP SAID, "THEN, I GUESS I'LL CLOSE MY ROBE." [ LAUGHTER ] HE SHOULDN'T DO THAT. THAT SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING -- NO, NO, NO, THAT SHOULDN'T BE ON THE LIST.
Steve: TRUMP TOWER.
Jimmy: NO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I APOLOGIZE. AND THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. I READ A NEW SUPER PAC IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO CONVINCE AMISH PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. MOST PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "LOOK, WE'RE NOT AMISH. WE JUST GOT RID OF OUR TVs SO WE COULD STOP HEARING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "WE'RE TIRED. PLEASE, LEAVE US ALONE." MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP'S EX-GIRLFRIEND SAID HER THAT QUOTES IN THE NEW YORK TIMES EXPOSE THIS WEEK WERE TWISTED TO SOUND NEGATIVE. BUT, SHE DIDN'T HAVE A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH TRUMP. AND SHE SAID, "NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M GOING TO GO DRIVE THE NEW PORSCHE I CAN SUDDENLY AFFORD." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAT DOWN WITH BUZZFEED FOR HIS FIRST FACEBOOK LIVE INTERVIEW. NOW, THESE LIVE-STREAM INTERVIEWS CAN BE TRICKY BECAUSE EVERYBODY TUNES IN AT A A CERTAIN TIME WHETHER YOU'RE READY OR NOT. I THINK BUZZFEED HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE. JUST TAKE A LOOK.
WE ARE AWAITING PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO'S GOING TO COME THROUGH THAT DOOR AT ANY MOMENT. WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHEN. NOW, I'M HERE TODAY WAITING FOR THE PRESIDENT TO COME THROUGH THAT DOOR.

THIS ISN'T GOOD HERE, YOU GUYS. OVER 400 PASSENGERS MISSED THEIR FLIGHTS AT CHICAGO O'HARE ON SUNDAY BECAUSE THE TSA SECURITY LINES WERE UP TO THREE HOURS LONG. BAD NEWS FOR TRAVELERS. GOOD NEWS FOR DADS WHO INSISTED ON GETTING TO THE AIRPORT FIVE HOURS EARLY. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, "TOLD YOU, ADMIT IT! I WAS RIGHT, RIGHT? TOLD YOU!" [ APPLAUSE ] MY PARENTS.

IN CELEBRATION OF QUEEN ELIZABETH'S 90th BIRTHDAY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE JUST RELEASED RARE IMAGES OF THE QUEEN FROM THE 1930s. THAT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE. HERE SHE IS TODAY, AND HERE SHE IS 80 YEARS AGO. AIN'T THAT AMAZING? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CHECK THIS OUT. THE OLDEST PERSON IN THE WORLD, A 116-YEAR-OLD WOMAN FROM ITALY ATTRIBUTES HER LONG LIFE TO EATING EGGS AND BEING SINGLE.

Jimmy: YOU CAN ALWAYS BE TOGETHER. WELL IT LOOKS GREAT. YOU ALWAYS PULL EVERYTHING OFF.
I GOT YOU ONE IN THIS EXACT SAME SIZE WAITING BACKSTAGE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A HALF SHIRT, YEAH. I SAW SOMETHING ON YOUR INSTAGRAM I THOUGHT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO ME. YOUR KNEE, YOUR KNEECAP IS AN IMPERSONATOR --
YEAH.
Jimmy: OF SORTS.
IT'S GOT AN EXTREMELY ODD RESEMBLANCE TO A CELEBRITY.
Jimmy: THIS IS INTERESTING. THIS IS YOUR KNEECAP HERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THIS IS CARLTON BANKS FROM -- [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S INTERESTING. YEAH. I DO SEE THE EYES. THE EYES AND THE NOSE AND THE SMILE.

Jimmy: YOUR KNEE IS A A PERFECT IMPERSONATOR OF SETH ROGEN.
NOW THIS IS WEIRD. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, IT'S REALLY WEIRD.
Jimmy: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING -- I DID A MOVIE WITH SETH AND I GOT A A PICTURE OF HIM AND HIS FACE RIGHT BY MY KNEE AND I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND IT ON MY INSTAGRAM BUT IT WAS IN, LIKE, 2014. SO TO GO TO 2014 ON MY INSTAGRAM, IF ANYONE FOLLOWS ME, I'M AN OBNOXIOUS POSTER. I POST LIKE 7 TO MAYBE 20 A DAY. SO I HAD TO JUST KEEP SCROLLING SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME IN THE PAST WEEK TO ACTUALLY FIND THAT PHOTO. SO THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH. BUT I'VE ACTUALLY SHOWED IT TO SETH. AND HE EVEN THOUGHT IT WAS COMPLETELY --
Jimmy: IT'S UNCANNY.
IT'S VERY STRANGE.
Jimmy: IT'S FANTASTIC, YEAH. SEE, I LIKE THIS ABOUT YOU BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE -- YOU'RE A COACH ON "THE VOICE." I THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE.
I'M JUST GLAD I HAVE SOMETHING TO FALL BACK ON. IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK OUT ON MY CAREER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU --
AND IF SETH FOR SOME REASON TAKES A HORRIBLE TURN, I CAN ALWAYS --
Jimmy: YOU CAN BE HIM ACTING IN MOVIES.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LIKE, "HEY BUDDY, HA HA HA."
IF HE CAN'T MAKE IT. YOU JUST ADD A LITTLE SUIT RIGHT HERE.
Jimmy: YOU CAN DO THAT, YEAH. A LITTLE TIE AND GLASSES.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: OH, GOD. HE'S COMING ON. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING THAT UP AGAIN.
YEAH, HE'LL LOVE THAT. HE LOVES THAT IMPRESSION. YOU LOOK JUST LIKE MILEY CYRUS' KNEE. HE REALLY THINKS THAT'S A GREAT COMPLIMENT.
Jimmy: HE WOULDN'T MIND THAT.
NO, I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR "THE VOICE." I THINK "THE VOICE" THIS YEAR IS GOING TO BE VERY FUN BECAUSE WE GOT ALICIA, WHO -- IT'S THE FIRST YEAR THERE'S BEEN --
Jimmy: LOVER HER, YEAH.
-- TWO GIRLS. AND SO THERE'S ALWAYS -- I THINK EVERYONE LOVES TO SEE BLAKE AND ADAM GO BACK AND FORTH. AND WE ACTUALLY ARE KIND OF VERY MUCH THE OPPOSITE. WE WERE TOGETHER TODAY AND IT'S LIKE A TOTAL LOVE FEST. JUST HER AND I ARE BOTH EXTREMELY MELLOW. AND SO I THINK PEOPLE, WHEN THEY PUT GIRLS ON TV, THEY EXPECT THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THE RATINGS. BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE DRAMA AND THERE'S GOING TO BE CATFIGHTS AND THERE'S GOING TO BE ALL THESE KIND OF -- THEY'RE THINKING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BRING KIND OF THE DRAMATICS TO THE SHOW. AND WE COULDN'T BE MORE OPPOSITE. AND WE JUST BOTH LOVE MUSIC. AND I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF -- I HOPE I WIN BUT ALICIA COULD POSSIBLY TOO BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THIS AS -- YOU KNOW, THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS TEN SEASONS. SO THIS IS -- WE HAVE A FRESH START OF WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY REALLY EXCITED TO GO IN, AND WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS FOR SO LONG WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH EACH ARTIST FOR AS LONG AS WE CAN. BLAKE MADE A JOKE OF HE KNOWS WHY I ALWAYS HAVE MY TONGUE OUT. IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS TIRED BECAUSE I NEVER STOP TALKING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT HE'S GOING TO REGRET THAT WHEN I WIN. BECAUSE IT CAME IN HANDY WHEN I WAS THERE AND REALLY WANTED TO SPEND TIME WITH, YOU KNOW, EACH CONTESTANT.
Jimmy: I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
THERE ARE SOME AWESOME SINGERS. I DIDN'T REALIZE KIND OF -- BECAUSE I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE HOW KIND OF -- IT WAS -- IT WAS -- NOT SET UP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT WASN'T EVER SET UP. THE KIDS AREN'T, LIKE, YOU KNOW, SECRETLY, LIKE, IN OPERA HOUSES IN GERMANY. THEY'RE ACTUALLY RANDOM ASS PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK ANYONE THOUGHT THAT.
I REALLY DID. [ LAUGHTER ] I REALLY THOUGHT THEY GO AND FIND THESE UNDERGROUND LIKE INDIE ARTISTS. AND THEN JUST PUT IT ON THE MAINSTREAM.
Jimmy: BUT ALSO YOU'RE SO YOUNG, TOO, AS WELL. YOU'RE KIND OF -- I MEAN, HOW OLD ARE THESE KIDS THAT ARE GOING ON THE SHOW?
WELL, THERE'S SOME KIDS THAT WERE THERE THIS LAST TIME WHEN I MENTORED THAT -- ONE OF THE GIRLS IS LIKE 15, 16.
Jimmy: WOW.
AND THEN THERE'S SOME GUYS THAT COME IN THAT ARE, LIKE, MUCH OLDER. THEY REALLY RELATED A LOT TO ADAM AND TO BLAKE. AND SO IT WAS REALLY GREAT YOU GOT TO GET TO PICK YOUR TEAM AND THEY ALSO GET TO CHOOSE YOU. IT'S ALWAYS REALLY WEIRD WHEN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE CONTESTANT CHOOSE. LIKE I'VE SEEN WHERE TWO OF THE JUDGES TURN AROUND AT THE SAME TIME AND THEN THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO CHOOSE A JUDGE THAT'S KIND OF MORE WHAT THEY WANT TO BE AS AN ARTIST. THEY CAN LEARN MORE FROM THEM.
Jimmy: ALSO, THEY CAN LEARN A LOT FROM YOU. BECAUSE ALSO YOU'RE DOING OTHER STUFF TOO FOR CHARITY AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I WANT TO MENTION THE HAPPYHIPPIES.ORG.
YES, PLEASE.
Jimmy: YOU'RE RELEASING A A T-SHIRT. TODAY?
YEAH, THIS JUST CAME OUT TODAY. IT'S A COLLAB WITH MARILYN MINTER AND MARC JACOBS FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD.
Jimmy: AND THEY GO TO HAPPYHIPPIES.ORG FOR THAT?
YEP, AND IT'LL BE ON MY INSTAGRAM. MARC'S SELLING IT AND THEY'RE SUPER EXCLUSIVE. AND IT WAS JUST -- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO BE SOMEONE THAT SPEAKS OUT ABOUT THE WOMEN'S HEALTH RIGHTS AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO NOT BE AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT THAT. AND I'M A GOOD PERSON -- WHEN THERE'S A COMPANY THAT'S HAVING A HARD TIME WITH PEOPLE BEING AFRAID OF SOMETHING, I'M A GOOD PERSON TO PUT ON THE FACE OF A A T-SHIRT.
Jimmy: JUST LET HER DO IT.
SHE'LL SAY IT NO MATTER WHAT THE [ BLEEP ] IT IS . SORRY, I'LL SAY IT. I'M GOOD AT JUST SAYING IT.
