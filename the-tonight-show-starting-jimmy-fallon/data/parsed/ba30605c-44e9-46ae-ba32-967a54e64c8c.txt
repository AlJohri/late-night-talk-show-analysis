Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HEY, WELCOME! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. YOU'RE HERE. THIS IS IT, YOU'RE A PART OF IT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LIKE THAT, THAT'S A NICE SHIRT! YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD. ALL RIGHT. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT, EVERYBODY. I SAW THAT DONALD TRUMP REPORTED FOR JURY DUTY TODAY IN NEW YORK CITY. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. MARKING THE FIRST TIME SOMEBODY DIDN'T HAVE TO PRETEND THEY WERE RACIST OR SEXIST TO GET OUT OF JURY DUTY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, THEY DIDN'T ALLOW CAMERAS IN THE COURTROOM WHILE TRUMP WAS THERE, BUT THEY DID RELEASE A SKETCH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DIDN'T REALIZE HE LOOKS LIKE TOM BRADY. HE LOOKS A LOT LIKE TOM BRADY.
Steve: HE DOES. "THE BRADY BUNCH." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON WENT TO THE IOWA STATE FAIR OVER THE WEEKEND. THINGS GOT AWKWARD WHEN DONALD TRUMP GOT ON THE MERRY-GO-ROUND AHEAD OF HILLARY AND SAID, "YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME." [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE GOES -- MERRY-GO-ROUND. AND DID YOU SEE THIS, DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY WOUND UP GIVING KIDS AT THE FAIR FREE RIDES ON HIS HELICOPTER? EVEN THE DRUNK GUY RIDING THE TILT-A-WHIRL WAS LIKE, "IS THAT SAFE?" [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW. BUT DONALD TRUMP OFFERED TO GIVE SOME KIDS A RIDE IN HIS HELICOPTER. CHECK THIS OUT.
AND DO YOU AGREE WITH ME? DOES EVERYBODY AGREE WITH ME?
YES.
YEAH.
THEY'RE SMART. LET'S GIVE THEM A HELICOPTER RIDE, OKAY? RIGHT? GOOD.

YEAH, GET THEM OUT OF HERE -- MAKE SURE IT'S ALL RIGHT. OF COURSE, A LOT OF OTHER POLITICIANS THOUGHT TRUMP'S ARRIVAL ON HIS PRIVATE HELICOPTER WAS "TOO FLASHY." IN FACT, CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID HE WOULD RATHER ARRIVE ON A PONY. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL AFTER HEARING THAT, A FEW PONIES HAD SOME STATEMENTS OF THEIR OWN. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS PONY SAID, "HE'S JOKING, RIGHT? WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO GIVE CHRIS CHRISTIE A RIDE, RIGHT?" [ LAUGHTER ] THIS PONY SAID, "NOT IT. I CALL NOT IT."

'CAUSE NOTHING SAYS CONFIDENCE LIKE PROMISING YOUR PRESIDENCY WOULD BE OVER QUICKLY. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S SOME LOCAL NEWS. HERE I READ THAT NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO JUST SIGNED A BILL THAT BANS POWDERED ALCOHOL FROM THE STATE. SO, IF YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK AND YOU'RE CONSUMING POWDERED ALCOHOL, YOUR LIFE JUST SOMEHOW GOT WORSE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SOMEHOW -- NO POWDERED ALCOHOL LEGAL, NO. IS THAT A THING? I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT WAS A A THING?
Steve: YEAH, IT'S A THING. CRAZY. POWDERED.

WHAT'S THE ACCENT YOU'RE DOING? I'M GOING TO GO FOR IT.
Steve: GOOD LUCK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
YOU HAVE SO MUCH EGG ON YOUR FACE. [ LAUGHTER ] LITERALLY.
Jimmy: AND FIGURATIVELY.
AND FIGURATIVELY. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ LAUGHTER ] [ SCREAMING ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
Steve: ZAC IS THE CHAMPION!

Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST IS A A BEST-SELLING AUTHOR. ONE OF THE FUNNIEST WOMEN WE KNOW, PLEASE WELCOME OUR GOOD FRIEND FRAN LEBOWITZ, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: FRAN, WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK.
YOUR MOTHER MUST BE SO PROUD OF YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I CAN ALREADY TELL YOU YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED IN ME. YEAH. WELL, IT'S SHOW BUSINESS. IT'S SO NICE SO SEE YOU. I SAW YOU OVER THE WEEKEND. IT WAS VERY FUN TO RUN INTO YOU OVER THE WEEKEND. BECAUSE -- I HAVE FUN RUNNING INTO YOU ALL THE TIME BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS REACTION -- EXACT REACTION WHEN YOU SEE ME ALL THE TIME, YEAH. YOU -- YEAH. BECAUSE YOU THINK I STOLE YOUR APARTMENT. BECAUSE I OUTBID YOU IN NEW YORK CITY. I OUTBID YOU, BUT I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS YOU.
IN WHICH CASE, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU'D KNOWN IT WAS ME -- THAT WOULD HAVE MADE A A DIFFERENCE?
Jimmy: OF COURSE. OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. I WOULD HAVE LET YOU HAVE THE APARTMENT. ANYWAY, I GO TO THIS EVENT, WHERE IT'S THIS NICE BIG -- RON PEARLMAN HAD THIS NICE, BIG EVENT, "THE ROOTS" WERE THERE BENEFITTING THE "APOLLO THEATER." I GO UP AND I SAW YOU THERE. I WAS WITH MY WIFE. WE WERE BOTH WEARING SEERSUCKER BLAZERS.
KIND OF. [ LAUGHTER ] YOURS WAS KIND OF SEERSUCKER.
Jimmy: NO, MINE WAS TOTALLY -- MINE WAS TOTALLY SEERSUCKER.
NO. YOURS WAS SEERSUCKER-ESQUE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN I GOT DRESSED TODAY TO COME HERE, I THOUGHT, "NO, HE'S NOT THIS SNAPPY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NOT AT ALL. I WOULD WEAR SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT.
Jimmy: BUT YOU ALWAYS COME AND YOU GIVE ME A GOOD LESSON ABOUT ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALL THE TIME.
HASN'T WORKED SO FAR. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT IS SOMETHING A A CHILD WOULDN'T KNOW TO DO. CRACK AN EGG ON THEIR HEAD.
THEY WOULDN'T KNOW THAT IT WASN'T A FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOUR PRODUCER SAID -- I SAID, "WHAT IS HE DOING?" SHE SAID, "RUSSIAN ROULETTE." THEN I WAS INTERESTED. BUT THEN SHE -- I MISSED THE EGG PART. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HEY! YOU DON'T WANT TO BE PLAYING REAL "RUSSIAN ROULETTE." THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT UH -- SKATEBOARDING. YOU GO, "YEAH." WE WERE SAYING, IF YOU'RE AN ADULT, YOU DON'T SKATEBOARD.
WELL, WHEN I WAS YOUNG, LIKE, REALLY A CHILD, THEY DIDN'T HAVE SKATEBOARDING. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY INVENTED IT, BUT AFTER I WAS A CHILD. WHICH I'M GLAD BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY BAD AT AS A CHILD.
Jimmy: YOU WEREN'T A BIG SPORTS, ACTIVITY --
NO.
Jimmy: NO.
NO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT WERE YOU LIKE AS A CHILD? DID YOU ENJOY SUMMER?
I WAS SHORTER.
Jimmy: YES. [ LAUGHTER ]
OTHERWISE, PRETTY SIMILAR TO WHAT I AM NOW. BUT I DIDN'T LIKE TO DO THOSE KIND OF DANGEROUS THINGS, YOU KNOW. LIKE, WE CLIMBED TREES AND PLAYED -- I DIDN'T LIKE TO DO THOSE THINGS. NOT LIKE THIS GUY YOU HAD ON BEFORE WHO WAS SWIMMING WITH THE SHARKS.
Jimmy: YEAH. HE LOVES SWIMMING WITH SHARKS. NO, I'M NOT LIKE THAT EITHER, NO.
NO. I MEAN, IF THAT WAS, IN FACT, A A REAL PHOTOGRAPH, I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT, WAS "REALLY?"
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. WHO TOOK THAT? I FORGOT TO ASK THE OBVIOUS QUESTION. WHO ELSE WAS DOWN THERE? YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
I SAID THAT YOU SEE IN NEW YORK ALL, THE TIME ADULTS SKATEBOARDING. NOT JUST ADULTS, MIDDLE-AGED MEN. COME ON. 40-YEAR-OLD MEN SKATEBOARDING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I SEE SOMEONE FALL AND I REALLY HAD TO STIFLE MY LAUGHTER. "WHY YOU FELL? BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO OLD TO BE SKATEBOARDING." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A A 40-YEAR-OLD WOMAN SKATEBOARDING.
Jimmy: I PROBABLY HAVEN'T. NO. WHY?
BECAUSE WOMEN GROW UP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
NO HUSBAND EVER HAD TO SAY TO HIS 40-YEAR-OLD WIFE, "HONEY, PLEASE DON'T SKATEBOARD. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU? WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF US?"
Jimmy: IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU LIKE? IS THERE ANYTHING YOU LOATHE?
MANY, MANY THINGS.
Jimmy: YEAH. WHAT DO YOU ENJOY?
I LIKE TO READ.
Jimmy: YES! ANY GOOD BOOKS I COULD MAYBE CHECK OUT?
YOU COULD CHECK THEM OUT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN READ THEM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHICH ONE HAS THE MOST PICTURES? [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT I DID MEET YOUR DELIGHTFUL WIFE AT THIS PARTY.
Jimmy: YES. THANK YOU.
AND I KNEW WHO SHE WAS BECAUSE SHE SAID TO ME, "HI, I'M THE PERSON WHO STOLE YOUR APARTMENT AND YOUR NAME." [ LAUGHTER ]
JIMMY: I'M GLAD THAT YOU DID. SHE LOVED TALKING TO YOU.
THEN SHE DESCRIBED WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO MY APARTMENT. SHE SAID, "YOU HAVE TO COME SEE IT." AND I THOUGHT, "THESE PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE THE IDEA I'M HAPPY FOR THEM." [ LAUGHTER ] "YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT," SHE SAID. I SAID, "I'M NOT."
Jimmy: WE'VE DONE GREAT THINGS. WE'RE ABOUT TO MOVE IN. THE BABY IS READY TO GO IN. IT'S GREAT. TURNS OUT WE HAVE THE SAME -- WE HAVE SIMILAR MOVERS.
NO. WE HAVE THE SAME MOVER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YES. HOW DID I DISCOVER THIS? BECAUSE LAST TIME I WAS ON, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS APARTMENT. AND THEN I MOVED. I HAVE TO KEEP MOVING BECAUSE YOU TOOK MY APARTMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND MY MOVER WHO, HAS BEEN MY MOVER SO LONG THAT MY ORIGINAL MOVER WAS HIS FATHER, SAID, "OH, I SAW YOU ON 'JIMMY FALLON.' IT WAS REALLY FUNNY. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT APARTMENT WOULD BE GREAT FOR YOU. YOUR FURNITURE IS PERFECT FOR THERE." I SAID, "HOW DO YOU KNOW?" HE SAID, "I'M HIS MOVER." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE HAVE SIMILAR TASTES.
WE HAVE THE SAME MOVER, YEAH.
Jimmy: WE'VE ALSO BEEN TO -- WE SEE EACH OTHER AT EVENTS. WE'VE HUNG OUT. WE'VE BEEN TO BROADWAY SHOWS TOGETHER. DO YOU GO TO A LOT OF MUSICALS?
I LOATHE MUSICALS.
Jimmy: WE HAVE ONE ON TONIGHT. WE HAVE A GREAT ONE ON TONIGHT.
I DIDN'T BOOK THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO --
BUT I SAW "HAMILTON," WHICH IS FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: WELL, THAT'S A A MUSICAL.
YES. BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD, OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] IT IS REALLY GOOD. IT DIDN'T EVER OCCUR TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE EVERYONE SAID HOW GREAT IT WAS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THERE'S NO SURER SIGN THAT SOMETHING IS NO GOOD THAN EVERYONE LOVES IT. DONALD TRUMP IS LEADING IN THE POLLS. BUT "HAMILTON" IS FANTASTIC. IT WAS GREAT. IT IS GREAT.
Jimmy: IT IS.
ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S GREAT IS PEOPLE DON'T BURST INTO SONG, WHICH IS WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT MUSICALS. THEY JUST SING THE WHOLE TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THERE'S NO BURSTING.
Jimmy: THERE'S NO BURSTING IN THE --
NO. THEY SING THE ENTIRE TIME.
Jimmy: SO IT'S -- YEAH, SO YOU --
IT'S MORE LIKE AN OPERA, EXCEPT IT'S GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DON'T ENJOY THE OPERA EITHER, NO. WOULD YOU GIVE A QUOTE IF THEY WANTED A QUOTE FOR "HAMILTON?" OH, MY GOD, FRAN LEBOWITZ SAYS THAT -- "GO SEE 'HAMILTON' BECAUSE?"
"IT'S NOT ANNOYING." [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ [ APPLAUSE ]
