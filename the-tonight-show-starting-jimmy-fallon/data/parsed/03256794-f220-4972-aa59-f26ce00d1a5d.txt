BUSY GUY.
Jimmy: BUT YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY.
WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS "FIST FIGHT" MOVIE EVERYWHERE I GO.
Jimmy: "FIST FIGHT" IS COMING OUT FRIDAY. WE HAD ICE CUBE ON THE SHOW WHO'S THE BEST AND HE LOVES YOU. HE SAID HE WAS JUST A FAN OF YOUR WORK AND WANTED TO DO SOMETHING WITH YOU SO BAD. HE'S LIKE --
THAT'S SURREAL TO HEAR, BUT YEAH, IT WAS GREAT.
Jimmy: THAT ICE CUBE WANTING TO WORK WITH YOU? YOU GO, "YEAH." YOU'RE AMAZING. SO, THE IDEA OF THIS, IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE PREMISE OF THIS MOVIE, "FIST FIGHT," IS YOU KIND OF GET HIM FIRED, RIGHT?
YEAH. WE'RE TWO SCHOOLTEACHERS AND I GET HIM FIRED AND HE CHALLENGES ME TO A FIGHT AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL DAY.
Jimmy: THE TEACHERS?
YEAH. THE TEACHERS. [ LAUGHTER ] HIS PERSONALITY IS ICE CUBE-ISH AND MINE'S CHARLIE DAY-ISH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO YOU CAN DO THE MATH. I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THE GUY. AND I SPEND THE MOVIE TRYING TO WORM OUT OF IT AND THEN WE DELIVER PROBABLY THE MOST EPIC FIGHT IN THE HISTORY OF MOVIE FIGHTS.
Jimmy: REALLY?
I THINK IT'S VERY SATISFYING FOR THE AUDIENCE.
Jimmy: IT PAYS OFF? YEAH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. I GUESS TRACY MORGAN'S IN IT, TOO. HE'S JUST HILARIOUS. YOU JUST -- YOU CAN'T BEAT TRACY.
CAN'T BEAT TRACY.
Jimmy: NO. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYBODY A A CLIP. HERE'S CHARLIE DAY IN "FIST FIGHT." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WHAT'S YOUR EMERGENCY?
YES, HI. THERE'S A CRAZY GUY AT MY HIGH SCHOOL HE'S TRYING TO BEAT ME UP.
911 IS FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A A BULLY I NEED YOU TO SPEAK TO A TEACHER.
NO. I AM A TEACHER.
EXCUSE ME?
THERE'S ACTUALLY ANOTHER TEACHER WHO'S GOING TO BEAT ME UP AFTER SCHOOL. THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING.
I'M SORRY. CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME?
OKAY, MY NAME IS ANDREW CAMPBELL. I'M A TEACHER AT ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL. THERE'S ANOTHER TEACHER HERE WHO WANTS TO HAVE A FIST FIGHT WITH ME AFTER SCHOOL, SO I NEED HELP. [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD LIKE YOU TO STOP LAUGHING AND LISTEN TO MY --
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN. NOW GO ON AND TAKE THAT ASS-WHOPPING! [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT'S SUPER FUNNY. "FIST FIGHT." HAVE YOU -- I HAVE TO ASK. EVERYBODY PROBABLY ASKS YOU THIS. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN A FIST FIGHT? ARE YOU A FIGHTER?
LIKE, KIDS WOULD LIKE TRY TO START FIGHTS WITH ME. I HIT A KID WITH A TROMBONE ONCE AND THAT PRETTY MUCH -- THAT STOPPED THE FIGHT RIGHT THERE.
Jimmy: YOU HIT HIM WITH A A TROMBONE.
YOU KNOW WHAT? THE GUY WITH THE TROMBONE WINS.
Jimmy: OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IF YOU DON'T HAVE IS A A TROMBONE, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.
Jimmy: DON'T MESS WITH THAT.
YEAH, BUT I WOULD TRY TO BREAK UP FIGHTS A LOT. I HAD LIKE -- I WOULD LIKE TO GET IN PEOPLE'S HEADS AND CONFUSE THEM. I CAN REMEMBER IN COLLEGE THERE WERE THESE TWO, LIKE, HUGE GUYS. ONE ON THE HOCKEY TEAM AND A A FOOTBALL GUY AND I DON'T KNOW THESE TWO GUYS. I GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM AND I START GOING, "HEY, MAN, I GOT SOFT SHOES, SOFT SHOES. WHO WANTS PIE? WHO WANTS NEWS? AND -- THEY'D BE SO CONFUSED. THEY'D BE LIKE, "I WANT TO FIGHT. I DON'T WANT PIE!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I GOT SOFT SHOES.
"I MEAN, I KIND OF WANT PIE, BUT -- WHO'S THIS KID?" YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT YOU DO THAT.
WHAT DO THE SHOES HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

Jimmy: I'D BE WALKING AND I'D GO, "I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M THE SAME ROOM --"
YEAH, IN MY HEAD THAT'S -- THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING, BUT, NO, ACTUALLY, I TOLD MYSELF, SINCE MY FIRST SHOW, LIKE, I NEVER LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE. EVER.
Jimmy: NO ONE?
NO. NO ONE. I WON'T -- LIKE, IF I DO, IT WILL, LIKE, MESS ME UP. IT'S KIND OF LIKE BEING ONSTAGE, I GUESS. LIKE, IF YOU'RE A THEATER ACTOR. IT'S LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING JUST TO TAKE YOU OUT OF YOUR, LIKE, ZONE.
