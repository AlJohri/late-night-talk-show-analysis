Jimmy: OSCAR, ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.
Jimmy: LAST TIME YOU WERE ON WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE RAN INTO EACH OTHER IN LONDON, WE ENDED UP HANGING OUT ALL NIGHT. WE MET THIS CRAZY -- NOT CRAZY. A COOL. CRAZY IN A COOL WAY.
WILD.
Jimmy: WILD AND CRAZY, YEAH. POET. AND HE CAME AND WAS DOING ALL THESE POEMS FOR US. AND WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE BAR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND HE JUST KEPT PERFORMING AND PERFORMING AND PERFORMING. AND WE WERE LIKE --
AGGRESSIVELY.
Jimmy: YEAH. WE'VE GOT TO GO HOME. AND THEN I WAS BRINGING THIS UP WITH OSCAR BACKSTAGE, AND YOU GO, YEAH, THIS TIME YOU'RE IN LONDON, YOU'RE SHOOTING THE NEW "STAR WARS"?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: I HEARD ABOUT THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT "STAR WARS." I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING. BUT YOU RUN INTO AL PACINO? IS THIS POSSIBLE?
YEAH, I DID ACTUALLY. JESSICA CHASTAIN WAS -- WE JUST DID "A MOST VIOLENT YEAR." AND SHE WAS IN LONDON. THERE'S THE THREE AMIGOS.
Jimmy: AND THIS IS NOT PHOTOSHOPPED. YOU JUST GAVE THIS TO ME RIGHT NOW. FROM YOUR PHONE?
OR JESSICA'S -- AND SHE'S LIKE I'M GOING TO DINNER. AL'S GOING TO BE THERE. I'M LIKE AL? YEAH, AL'S GOING TO BE THERE. YOU'VE GOT TO COME.
Jimmy: LIKE WEIRD AL YANKOVIC. I LOVE THAT GUY. HE'S FANTASTIC. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU MEET AL PACINO. TELL ME SOMETHING FUNNY. BUT OH NO, BUT THE ONE AND ONLY, IT'S AL PACINO.
YEAH, YEAH. HE WALKED IN AND GOES "OH, THEY'VE BEEN TELLING ME ABOUT YOU. IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU." WHICH WAS CRAZY THAT HE SAID THAT.
Jimmy: THEY'VE BEEN TELLING ME ABOUT YOU?
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S COOL TO HEAR AL PACINO SAY THAT.
AND THEN I JUST NERDED OUT AND IT WAS LIKE THE CHRIS FARLEY SHOW AGAIN. LIKE I REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE IN "DOG DAY AFTERNOON" AND SAID ATTICA? THAT WAS SO COOL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO DO IT. BUT HE'S PROBABLY SO BUMMED THAT HE'S SO GOOD.
IT'S ALSO REALLY NERVE-WRACKING BECAUSE I DON'T USUALLY LIKE TO MEET PEOPLE THAT I ADMIRE A LOT BECAUSE I'M AFRAID THAT I'LL SAY SOMETHING HORRIBLE OR THAT THEY'LL BE HORRIBLE AND I WON'T LIKE THEIR STUFF ANYMORE. I JUST GET SO NERVOUS. THIS TIME I WAS LIKE, YEAH, IN "DOG DAY AFTERNOON" WHICH I'VE SEEN EVERY WEEK EVER SINCE I WAS 17. IT'S LIKE YOU WERE LIKE A CHILD ACTOR IN THAT. AND HE'S LIKE WHAT? NO, NO, I MEAN LIKE SO IMAGINATIVE AND YOU WEREN'T -- YOU'RE NOT SELF-CONSCIOUS AND -- LIKE A GREAT CHILD ACTOR. AND HE'S LIKE, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HE WAS SO GRACIOUS. HE WAS LIKE I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. I WASN'T AWARE OF THE CAMERAS. YES. THAT'S WHILE TRYING TO SAY.
Jimmy: SECURITY. LET'S GET HIM OUT OF HERE. LET'S GO. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT EITHER WAY, IT TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT.
AND HE WAS AMAZING. SUCH AN AMAZING GUY.
Jimmy: YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE?
NO. BUT WE TEXT A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: WHAT?
HE LOVES EMOTICONS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HE DOES? EMOJIS?
YEAH. LOTS OF SMILEY FACES. AND THE GUY WITH THE MUSTACHE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GUY WITH THE MUSTACHE?
WHICH IS MY GUY TOO. SO IT'S KIND OF AMAZING.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT YOU DO TOO?
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: I DO LIKE GHOST WITH THE PIRATE THING. THE EYE PATCH. GHOST WITH THE EYE PATCH. YOU KNOW THAT ONE?
YEAH, I'VE SEEN THAT ONE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M NOT GOING TO BE FRIENDS WITH AL PACINO. REALLY? THE SMILEY FACE WITH A A MUSTACHE? OR WHAT IS IT?
IT'S LIKE THIS GUY.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT GUY.
Jimmy: THAT LOOKS LIKE THE PRINGLES MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] PRETTY GOOD.
A LITTLE HEART NEXT TO IT.
Jimmy: YEAH RIGHT. YOU DIDN'T -- YOU CAN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT "STAR WARS." BUT WE CAN TALK --
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE A PAL.
NO, TOO LATE, TOO LATE, I ALREADY SAID --
Jimmy: WAIT A SECOND. IS EVERYONE JUST FREAKED OUT AND EXCITED AND JUST BOTHERING YOU. FRIENDS AND FAMILY THEY'RE LIKE, OH MY GOSH, "STAR WARS" DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
YEAH, YEAH. MY UNCLE IN PARTICULAR WHO'S JUST THE BIGGEST "STAR WARS" FAN EVER. HE HAS A MINI MUSEUM WITH HIS FIGURES IN DIFFERENT POSES AND ALL IN GLASS. HE LOVES IT SO MUCH. WHEN I TOLD HIM I WAS CAST HE GOT GREEN AND HYPERVENTILATED.
Jimmy: OH YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU HAVE TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM THE SET.
BUT I BROUGHT HIM TO SET.
Jimmy: NO.
I HAD TO. I HAD TO BRING HIM TO SET. J.J. ABRAMS WAS LIKE "SECURITY?"
Jimmy: AL PACINO'S LIKE I KNOW THAT GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] EMOTICON YOUR UNCLES FACE BEHIND BARS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
NO, IN FACT, SO I TOLD J.J. ABRAMS JUST TO WARN HIM, MY UNCLE, HE'S A HUGE FAN. HE'S COMING TO SET. I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW. AND HE'S LIKE NO, IT'S GREAT. AND THEN MY UNCLE CAME WITH ALL THESE SHIRTS HE HAD MADE WITH EVERYONE'S NAMES ON THEM THAT SAID "ESTAR GUARS."
Jimmy: WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
ESTAR GUARS. [ LAUGHTER ] E-S-T-A-R G-U-A-R-S. ESTAR GUARS EPISODE 7. [ LAUGHTER ] ESTAR GUARS, AND HE HANDED THEM OUT TO EVERYBODY.
Jimmy: THAT'S PRETTY CUTE.
J.J. WAS LIKE YOU WANT TO BE IN THE MOVIE? AND HE'S LIKE OH, MY GOD. YES, YES. HE GOES YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE SHORT FOR A STORM TROOPER. HOW ABOUT -- THEN THEY GAVE HIM A PART. THEY MADE HIM AN EXTRA. THEY PUT HIM IN FULL MAKEUP AND --
Jimmy: WHAT? THAT'S AWESOME! [ APPLAUSE ] I LOVE J.J. ABRAMS. THAT GUY IS A GREAT GUY. HE'S INCREDIBLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT "EX MACHINA." I ALWAYS WANT TO SAY MACHINA.
THAT WOULD BE WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
IT'S LATIN.
Jimmy: ESTAR GUARS. [ LAUGHTER ] EX MACHINA.
EX MACHINA.
Jimmy: EX MACHINA, THIS IS A A TRIPPY GOOD FILM. I LIKE IT. AND BASICALLY YOU'RE BUILDING A A ROBOT. AN A.I. --
YES. I PLAY NATHAN GARRICK, WHO'S THE CEO OF BLUEBOOK, WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR SEARCH ENGINE IN THE WORLD. AND HE'S BEEN HIDING IN HIS RESEARCH FACILITY FOR YEARS. NO ONE'S SEEN HIM. AND ONE OF HIS EMPLOYEES -- FINDS OUT HE'S MADE THIS MACHINE, THIS ROBOT IN THE SHAPE OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN PLAYED BY ALICIA VIKANDER. AND HE'S THERE TO TEST IF THIS MACHINE HAS CONSCIOUSNESS, IF IT'S SELF-AWARE.
Steve: OOH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE HAVE A CLIP RIGHT HERE. OSCAR ISAAC IN "EX MACHINA."
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE TURING TEST IS?
YEAH. I KNOW WHAT THE TURING TEST IS. IT'S WHEN A HUMAN INTERACTS WITH A COMPUTER. AND IF THE HUMAN DOESN'T KNOW THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH A A COMPUTER THE TEST IS PASSED.
AND WHAT IS IT PASSED ON?
THAT THE COMPUTER HAS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. ARE YOU BUILDING AN A.I.?
I'VE ALREADY BUILT ONE. AND OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE HUMAN COMPONENT IN THE TURING TEST.
HOLY [ BLEEP ]
THAT'S RIGHT, CALEB. YOU GOT IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
