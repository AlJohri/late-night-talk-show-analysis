Jimmy: I HEARD THAT. I KNOW YOU ARE INTO TECH AND I  FOLLOW YOU ON TWITTER YOU DON'T  TWEET ANYMORE.
YEAH, THAT IS A FUNNY THING. I WENT TO CUBA RECENTLY. I JUST GOT BACK ABOUT A WEEK  AND A HALF AGO.
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU GET TO  CUBA?
YEAH, WELL I WAS DOING A A MOVIE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TOTALLY ILLEGAL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NOBODY'S WATCHING. NO BIG DEAL.
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, DUDE.
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU GET TO  CUBA? I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO  GO TO CUBA?
YEAH, I GUESS THE PRODUCTION  COMPANY GOT A LICENSE. THEY HAVE A DEAL. IT TOOK A LONG TIME.
YEAH, I THINK THE FIRST  THREE WEEKS YOU GET THERE AND  IT'S A CULTURE SHOCK. YOU KNOW, IT IS COMPLETELY  DIFFERENT. YOU TAKE THINGS FOR GRANTED. THE INTERNET, iPHONES AND  THINGS LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: THE INTERNET WAS -- DOESN'T REALLY.
YEAH, WELL I MEAN IT DOES. BUT THERE WAS LIKE IN A HOTEL  ROOM IT WAS I THINK 500 ROOMS  ON ONE DIAL UP CONNECTION. SO YOU WOULD GO AND CHECK YOUR  E-MAIL AND THEN WAKE UP THE  NEXT MORNING OR THREE DAYS  LATER AND THEN GET THEM AND  THEN RESPOND.
Jimmy: YEAH. ALL RIGHT FINE.
Jimmy: SO YOU GO AROUND AND  INSTEAD OF SENDING OUT  INSTAGRAM YOU ACTUALLY SHOW  PEOPLE THE FOOD ON YOUR PLATE.
YEAH, SURE, YEAH.
Jimmy: LOOK AT THIS. FIVE FOLLOWERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
MY FIVE FOLLOWERS.
Jimmy: THIS IS FRED. THIS IS JOHN.
FOLLOWING ME AROUND.
Jimmy: FOLLOWING ME ALL  AROUND CUBA. [ APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: THIS MOVIE,  SETH MacFARLANE IS ONE OF THE  FUNNIEST DUDES EVER. I'M MEAN "FAMILY GUY"  OBVIOUSLY. "TED," THE MOVIE ABOUT THE  TEDDY BEAR NOT THE "TED TALKS."
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO YOU WERE IN "TED."
YEAH I WAS.
Jimmy: YOU DID SOME GOOD  DANCE MOVES IN THERE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I GOTTA SAY, THAT WAS  SOME PRETTY -- PRETTY SHARP  DANCE MOVES. I LIKED IT A LOT.
IT WAS SORT OF AN  AFTERTHOUGHT. WE WERE JUST ON SET, AND I  WALKED UP TO SETH AND I WAS  LIKE, "I JUST WANT TO DANCE,  MAN." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WAS BORN TO DANCE.
AND THEN HE WAS LIKE,  "GREAT." AND THEN IT TURNED INTO THIS  THING AND NOW IT'S GOING TO BE  ON THE TOMBSTONE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S A GIF OF YOU  MOVING YOUR HIPS AROUND. BUT, THIS ONE IS "A MILLION  WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST." WHAT IS IT ABOUT AND WHO DO YOU  PLAY?
IT IS ABOUT A MILLION WAYS  TO DIE IN THE WEST. THE MOVIE TAKES PLACE IN 1882. AND ALBERT -- SETH MacFARLANE,  PLAYS THE CHARACTER BY THE NAME  OF THE ALBERT. I PLAY EDWARD HIS BEST FRIEND. I'M A VIRGIN IN THE STORY.
Jimmy: SURE.
AND MY GIRLFRIEND PLAYED  BY -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IN THE STORY.

Jimmy: AND CHARLIZE THERON,  YOU HAVE IN HERE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: LIAM NEESON IS IN THE  MOVIE.
YEAH, EXACTLY. THE CHEMISTRY -- I SAW THE  MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST  NIGHT. IT WAS REALLY GOOD. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. YOU'RE LAUGHING BUT IT'S ALSO  GOT AN EMOTIONAL HEART. AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS  YOU'RE REALLY PROUD OF. IT IS A CLASSIC.
Jimmy: EVERY TIME IS SEE THE  TRAILER IT ALWAYS MAKES ME  LAUGH. I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP. HERE IS GIOVANNI RIBISI IN "A  MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE  WEST." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
