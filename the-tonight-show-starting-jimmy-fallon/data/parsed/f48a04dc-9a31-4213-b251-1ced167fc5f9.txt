[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "HEY FALLON, IF THE CANADIENS WIN I WANT YOU TO WIN A A CANADIENS JERSEY DURING ONE OF YOUR MONOLOGUES." AND THINK OF THAT. "AND IF THE RANGERS WIN WE'LL HAVE -- WE'LL CHANGE THE TWITTER AVATAR PHOTO ON OUR TWITTER ACCOUNT." [ LAUGHTER ] I GO, "I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE A TWITTER ACCOUNT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT DOING THIS BET AT ALL." SO THEN THEY SAY, "ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT HOW ABOUT WE HAVE OUR MASCOT YOUPPI --" [ LAUGHTER ] AGAIN, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY HAD A MASCOT. YOUPPI. HE'D COME BRING THE ROOTS POUTINE OR SOMETHING. IT'S JUST LIKE -- IN CANADA, YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE FRENCH FRIES, GRAVY AND LIKE CHEESE CURD OR SOMETHING. AGAIN, I'M -- I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT EITHER. SO THE ROOTS HAVE A JOB TO DO. I DON'T WANNA SIT THERE AND WATCH THEM EAT FOOD DURING THE SHOW. SO I GO, "HERE'S THE DEAL. WHEN THE RANGERS WIN, NOT IF --" [ CHEERS ] "I CHANGE THE AVATAR TO A PHOTO OF MY CHOICE. AND ALSO I WANT YOUPPI TO WALK AROUND THE STREETS OF MONTREAL IN A RANGERS JERSEY." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THAT SAID ALL RIGHT. IT'S A DEAL. WE'LL DO THIS. SO I GOT TO SAY, THESE GUYS ARE GOOD SPORTS. THEY MADE GOOD ON THIS BET WITH ME.

Jimmy: THE ONE WITH THE FROWNING TREES.
GET SKY MALL. GET SKY MALL. IT'S WORTH TAKING A FLIGHT JUST TO READ SKY MALL.
Jimmy: I WANT TO ASK YOU A A QUESTION.
WHAT?
Jimmy: BECAUSE I KNOW YOU, YOU DID A CONCERT AS DAVID BRENT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHICH WE ALL LOVE, YOUR CHARACTER FROM "THE OFFICE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THE CONCERT -- BUT THEN YOU -- DAVID BRENT, YOU GO ON TOUR AND YOU'RE PLAYING THESE GIANT THINGS ON TOUR. DIGGING IT. LIKE, IT SOLD OUT IN LIKE, SIX SECONDS.
YEAH. IT WAS CRAZY. WHICH IS FUNNY BECAUSE DAVID BRENT CAN'T REALLY BE THAT SUCCESSFUL IN SELLING OUT LIKE BACH AND THE ROLLING STONES. CO --
Jimmy: YEAH, THE WHOLE IDEA IS THAT THINGS DON'T WORK OUT FOR HIM.
I KNOW! WELL, I BROUGHT IT BACK FOR A A COMIC RELEASE SKETCH WHERE HE DID A SONG CALLED "EQUALITY STREET" AND IT WAS BECAUSE MY FAVORITE EPISODE OF "THE OFFICE", I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE'S FAVORITE, WAS EPISODE FOUR WHEN I GOT THE GUITAR OUT.
Jimmy: RIGHT.
I DID A FEW SONGS. SO, I'VE WRITTEN A FEW. WE'VE GOT ABOUT 15 SONGS NOW WITH DAVID BRENT STILL TRYING TO BE A POP STAR AT LIKE, 50. AND SO, I'M DOING IT -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S, IT'S, IT'S SO TRAGIC BECAUSE I'M PROBABLY GOING TO DO A SPECIAL, A MOVIE OR SOMETHING WHERE IT'S HIM ON THE ROAD. AND HE THINKS IT'S LIKE, SCORSESE DOING THE ROLLING STONES BUT OF COURSE IT'S REALLY A "WHERE ARE THEY NOW?" [ LAUGHTER ] SO --
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC.
IT'S LIKE, THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT -- WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING SINCE AND IT'S JUST REALLY TRAGIC. IT'S PROBABLY MORE TRAGIC THAN THE ORIGINAL OFFICE.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST SAD. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, HE'S AT REST NOW AND HE GOES ON TOUR AND NOTHING HAPPENED.
Jimmy: OH, I LOVE IT.
AND HE'S PAYING FOR IT. AND HE'S TAKING HIS HOLIDAY LEAVE JUST TO GET ENOUGH -- IT'S TRAGIC.
Jimmy: WHEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WHEN I WATCH "DEREK", IT'S VERY FUNNY, BUT ALSO IT HAS A LOT OF HEART TO IT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S REALLY LIKE --
IT'S SLIGHTLY MORE SINCERE THAN "THE OFFICE" AND "EXTRAS" BECAUSE I THINK THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS WE WERE LAUGHING AT THE CHARACTERS IN "THE OFFICE" AND "EXTRAS." WE WERE LAUGHING AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW THEY SAW THEMSELVES AND HOW THE AUDIENCE SAW THEM. WHEREAS, WITH "DEREK", WE'RE SORT OF ON THEIR SIDE MORE. IT'S THE REST OF THE WORLD WE'RE LAUGHING AT. I SUPPOSE THEIR PREJUDICES AND STUFF. SO --
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A CLOSE KIND OF CONNECTION WITH THIS CHARACTER.
YEAH. YEAH, BECAUSE ALL MY FAMILY, ALL THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY, WERE -- THE MEN NOT SO MUCH. THEY WERE SORT OF CARE AS THEY WORKED IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOMES AND OUTSIDE -- MY SISTER, MY MUM, MY SISTER-IN-LAW, ALL THEIR KIDS NOW.
Jimmy: SO THIS KIND OF A A REAL STORY, AND YOU'RE WRITING ALL THIS.
YEAH, YEAH! I'VE GOT LIKE, 35 YEARS OF ANECDOTES. AND SOME ARE FUNNY, SOME ARE REALLY SAD AND SOME ARE TRAGIC.
Jimmy: AND YOU CRY!
YEAH, I DO. YEAH. YEAH.
Jimmy: IS IT HARD FOR YOU TO CRY?
WELL, NO, IT'S NOT, BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST THINK ABOUT DOING THIS SHOW AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I STILL GOT IT! STILL GOT IT, MAN!
I TELL YOU, THERE'S NOTHING MORE TRAGIC THAN THAT. NO, THIS IS A GREAT SHOW.
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IT'S A LOVELY SHOW. YOU'VE GOT LITTLE MUDDLES AND EVERYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'VE GOT A TAN NOW.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. I DO HAVE A TAN.
YEAH! COME ON! WHOO! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NEXT YEAR, YOU'LL -- LIBERACE, WON'T YOU?
Jimmy: I DO NOT LOOK LIBERACE.
NO, BUT WHEN I CRY, THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A PAY -- IN "THE OFFICE" AND "EXTRAS." AND I CRIED WHEN BRENT BEGGED FOR HIS JOB BACK AND I CRIED IN "EXTRAS" -- SAYING SORRY. I CRIED IN "THE INVENTION OF LYING" AND I CAN DO ALL THAT. I CAN CRY, BUT I CAN ONLY DO IT ONCE -- BECAUSE THEN YOU FEEL BETTER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S TRUE!
Jimmy: ONCE YOU GET THE CRYING --
I CAN CRY AND I CRIED FOR REAL. THEY'RE REAL TEARS. I GET CAUGHT UP AND I REALLY DO IT BUT THEN, YOU FEEL GREAT. SO, I CAN'T DO IT TWICE. SO AFTER THEY MAKE WITH THESE TWO CAMERAS AND THEY CAPTURED IT ALL, AND THAT'S EVERYTHING, EVERY TIME I CRIED ON TV OR FILM IT'S THE ONLY TAKE.
Jimmy: REALLY?
SO I HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT IN ONE TAKE.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SEE THE SECOND TAKE THOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
Jimmy: I KNOW, BUT I WANT TO SEE IT!
