YEAH. LIKE, I FEEL LIKE AT THE TIME IT WASN'T -- LIKE DADS COULD STILL BE HARD ASSES ABOUT LIKE NOT USING THE CAMERA. AND MY DAD WAS SO SWEET.
HARD ASS DAD.
Jimmy: YEAH, IS YOUR DAD NICOLAS CAGE? DON'T USE THE CAMERA! [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S A WHOLE MOVIE.
DON'T USE THE CAMERA!
Jimmy: THE DOLLAR BILL SAYS YOU CAN'T USE THE CAMERA.
NO, NO. HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF NICOLAS CAGE. HE WAS LIKE JUST TAKE IT. SO, WE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY. WE MADE -- WE HAD TWO STATIONS. KRAP-TV.
Jimmy: KRAP, YEAH.
REALLY FUNNY.
Jimmy: I LIKE THAT.
AND THEN THERE WAS A -- LIKE A MERGER IN THE GLAZER BASEMENT AND IT TURNED INTO GBS, GLAZER BROADCASTING SYSTEM.
Jimmy: OH OF COURSE. I SUBSCRIBE TO GBS.
YOU HAVE TO CALL -- IT'S WORTH IT.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT. AND LOOK AT YOU NOW. AND HOW ABOUT YOU?
I THINK THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS LIKE I SHOULD DO COMEDY I WAS MY STUDENT COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE IN EIGHTH GRADE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
FOR MY HOMEROOM.
Jimmy: THAT'S A BIG DEAL.
WHICH MEANS, LIKE, I WOULD GO TO THE MEETINGS AND COME BACK TO MY HOMEROOM AND LIKE REPORT ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SCHOOL.
Jimmy: YEAH.
FOR MY WHOLE EIGHTH GRADE YEAR, I DID THIS AS LINDA RICHMAN FROM "SNL."
Jimmy: COFFEE TALK.
YES.
Jimmy: BUT WHAT WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT? JUST PROBLEMS IN THE SCHOOL?
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT WOULD BE ONE PROBLEM?
OKAY. HERE WE GO. I REMEMBER THIS BECAUSE I STILL THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS.
Jimmy: MIKE MYERS IS GOING TO FREAK RIGHT NOW.
I WOULD COME IN, AND NOT DRESSED UP. IT WAS JUST ME. AND AS AN EXAMPLE -- "NEWS IN THE SCHOOL. THERE'S A FRUIT VENDING MACHINE BEING INSTALLED IN THE CAFETERIA ON WEDNESDAY MORNING. WE'LL START COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SEE THAT'S FUNNY.
IT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: THAT'S FUNNY.
IT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: SEE, MIKE MYERS? THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
I WILL SAY, IF IT WAS NOT FOR MY TEACHERS IN EIGHTH GRADE, I DON'T THINK I WOULD'VE DONE COMEDY.
Jimmy: REALLY?
THEY LET ME DO IT ALL YEAR.
Jimmy: AND KRAP-TV.
YEAH.
Jimmy: GOSH. IT'S JUST A FUN, FRESH SHOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO COMPARE IT TO. I THINK THAT'S WHY EVERYONE'S ENJOYING IT AND WATCHING IT BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO DIFFERENT. AND IT'S LOOSELY BASED ON YOUR LIVES IN NEW YORK CITY. RIGHT, KIND OF? I MEAN, THE STORIES ARE PRETTY -- SOME OF THEM ARE OUT THERE BUT MOST OF IT IS.
YEAH, WE PLAY ABBI AND ILANA.
Jimmy: INTERESTING. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THOSE NAMES?
YOU HAVE TO LAND ON IT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT JUST SOUNDED RIGHT.
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE OPTIONS BEFORE YOU LAND.
Jimmy: THERE'S SO MANY GOOD BITS. THERE'S ONE THING I ALWAYS LAUGH AT IS BED, BATH & BEYOND. YOU GO TO BED, BATH & BEYOND. YOU'RE LIKE, "HAVE YOU BEEN HERE BEFORE?" AND YOU'RE LIKE, "A COUPLE TIMES." BUT YET YOU KNOW ALL THE EMPLOYEES. YOU HAVE SPECIAL HANDSHAKES WITH ALL, LIKE CRAZY ELABORATE ONES AND YOU DO THIS WHOLE THING. IT'S THE BEST.
WE DO LIKE DANCING.
Jimmy: YEAH. MY QUESTION WAS ONE, DO YOU ACTUALLY GO TO BED, BATH & BEYOND? BECAUSE I THINK I KNOW WHICH ONE YOU GO TO. AND NUMBER TWO. [ LAUGHTER ] NUMBER TWO, CAN YOU GO THERE NOW? OR IS IT LIKE NORM GOING INTO A A BAR AND LIKE, "DON'T LOOK AT ME, EVERYBODY?" BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH, YOU'RE IN BED, BATH & BEYOND."
WELL, YEAH. IT'S BEEN DIFFERENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IS IT VERY TRAGIC?
NO, I JUST GET A LOT OF ANXIETY NOW. LIKE, I HAVE THIS CIRCLE LONG TRASHCAN AND I THINK I CAN ONLY BUY THE BAGS THERE. AND I LOVE THE STORE.
Jimmy: IT'S A GREAT STORE.
BUT I GET A LOT OF ANXIETY GOING THERE NOW. IT'S THE SAME ONE WE SHOT IN. AND I JUST --
Jimmy: DO THEY RECOGNIZE YOU? DO YOU GET LIKE --
AND YOU KNOW, NO ONE RECOGNIZES ME.
Jimmy: ZERO?
IT'S A BIG BUILD-UP ON MY PART AND NO ONE RECOGNIZES ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU COULD WEAR THE SAME OUTFIT YOU WORE ON THE EPISODE?
I KNOCK STUFF OVER AND NOTHING.
SHE DOES. SHE DRESSES UP IN THE OUTFIT. NOTHING.
Jimmy: ZERO AT ALL.
I GO UP TO THE EMPLOYEES AND I'M LIKE -- NOTHING.
Jimmy: NOTHING AT ALL. YOU GET ZERO.
THEY'RE LIKE, "GET OFF MY BODY."
WE EVEN WENT THERE RECENTLY TOGETHER AND NOBODY CARES. IT'S FINE.
ILANA NEEDED TO BUY THREE-WICK CANDLES.
SO, WE MADE AN EXCURSION.
Jimmy: NO. THAT'S TOO MANY WICKS.
IT'S EMBARRASSING.
Jimmy: THAT'S TWO TOO MANY.
IT HAS CHANGED ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
