I'M SITTING DOWN CAREFULLY 'CAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DRESSES THAT HAS ONE OF THOSE ZIPPERS THAT GOES ALL THE WAY UP THE BACK.

YOU KNOW, I WENT FOR A PEE BEFORE WALKING INTO THE DINNER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND I UNZIPPED THE DRESS FROM THE BOTTOM UP TO TAKE A A PEE. I SORT OF THOUGHT, THIS WILL BE FINE. HAVE MY PEE. GOING PRETTY GOOD. I ZIP THE DRESS BACK DOWN, AND THE BOTTOM OF THE ZIPPER CAME OFF IN MY HAND. I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF A A MIRROR BASICALLY WEARING A A TICKING TIME BOMB. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S GOING TO BE FINE. I'M LOOKING AT MY OWN REFLECTION AND I'M KIND OF GOING, THIS IS GONNA BE FUN. OH, MY GOD! AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ENTIRE DRESS UNZIPPED ITSELF AND WAS DANGLING FROM MY NECK LIKE A A CAPE.

Jimmy: AND YOU HAVE A A GRAMMY.
I DO. ISN'T THAT WEIRD?
Jimmy: BUT WHAT WAS THAT FOR? WHAT WAS THE GRAMMY?
I WAS ONE OF THREE PEOPLE ALONG WITH WYNTON MARSALIS, WHO WON GRAMMYS FOR SPOKEN WORD. YEAH. AND IT WAS -- IT WAS A VERY LONG TIME AGO. I THINK I WAS ONLY 22 AT THE TIME. AND SOMEONE KIND OF CALLED MY HOUSE AND SAID, HEY, WE ALL WON GRAMMYS. I WAS LIKE, WHAT -- WHAT?

Jimmy: WE COULD CALL SCOTT RUDIN. I KNOW YOU KNOW SCOTT RUDIN.
I KNOW HIM VERY WELL.
Jimmy: HE'S A GREAT BROADWAY PRODUCER. DID HE PRODUCE "STEVE JOBS"?
HE DID, HE DID. AND I'VE WORKED WITH HIM A A COUPLE TIMES BEFORE. SO, I DO KNOW HIM.
Jimmy: I LIKE THAT GUY.
YES.
Jimmy: BUT THIS -- YOU KIND OF REALLY WENT FOR THIS ROLE. I MEAN, YOU SAW THIS ROLE COMING UP AND YOU SAID I'M NOT GONNA LET -- I'M NOT GONNA EVEN -- BEFORE THIS EVEN COMES OUT I'VE GOTTA GET IN.
WELL, I HEARD ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, MOVIES, THEY OFTEN GO FROM ONE ACTOR TO ANOTHER AND ONE DIRECTOR TO ANOTHER AND EVEN MORE BEYOND THAT. AND SO I SORT OF HEARD ABOUT THIS FILM MUCH MORE THAN I THINK YOU NORMALLY WOULD 'CAUSE IT CHANGED STUDIOS AS WELL. AND I JUST -- AND I JUST SAID, YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS AMAZING. A FRIEND OF MINE IS A HAIR AND MAKEUP ARTIST IS ALREADY WORKING ON IT. AND I FINALLY TURNED TO HER AND I SAID, HANG ON. THIS ALL SOUNDS GREAT, BUT WHAT'S THE GIRLS PART? AND SHE WENT, "OH, ACTUALLY. OH, KATE." AND WE STARTED COOKING UP THIS PLAN TO SOMEHOW GET THEM TO SEND ME THE SCRIPT, WHICH AT THAT POINT THEY HAD NOT DONE. AND SO, I, YOU KNOW, THREW MY HAT IN THE RING AND LET IT BE KNOWN THAT SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO SEND ME A SCRIPT, I WOULD BE DELIGHTED. SO I TOOK A SELFIE OF MYSELF WEARING A SHORT DARK HAIRED WIG AND TRIED TO LOOK AS EASTERN EUROPEAN LIKE THE REAL JOANNA HOFFMAN AS I POSSIBLY COULD. I LOOK NOTHING LIKE HER. AND IT WENT MY WAY. THEY SENT ME THE SCRIPT AND THE MOVIE HAPPENED.
Jimmy: GREAT CASTING. BECAUSE MICHAEL FASSBENDER, I WOULDN'T SAY HE SHOULD BE STEVE JOBS AT ALL.
WELL, YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: HE'S IRISH.
HE IS IRISH. HE IS.
Jimmy: HOW ARE YA DOIN' THERE, MR. FALLON? I'M GONNA PLAY STEVE McJOBS. IT'S LIKE, NO, YOU CAN'T HONE STEVE McJOBS. HE'S AMERICAN.
MUST HE BE SCOTTISH THOUGH?
Jimmy: THAT WAS A LITTLE SCOTTISH. IS HE SCOTTISH?
NO, HE'S NOT. HE'S IRISH.
Jimmy: OH, BUT MY ACCENT WAS, YEAH.
YEAH, IT WAS.
Jimmy: YEAH, SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
UNFORTUNATELY.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHY I'M NOT IN THE MOVIE, YEAH. I AUDITIONED FOR YOUR PART, AS WELL. YEAH, I DIDN'T GET IT.
OH, DID YOU, DARLING?
Jimmy: YEAH, I DID.
HOW SWEET. SWEET.
Jimmy: SEE, I THINK THAT YOU'RE BEING SARCASTIC.
NO. NOT SARCASTIC.
Jimmy: BUT I MEAN, YOU NAILED IT. YOU DID GREAT. AND YOU'VE GOTTA SEE THIS MOVIE 'CAUSE IT'S FUN TO SEE HOW ALL THESE COMPUTERS THAT WE'RE JUST SO USED TO AND PHONES --
WELL, THAT'S THE THING. YOU KNOW, THE FILM, YES, IT'S ABOUT STEVE JOBS, BUT IT ISN'T A BIOPIC. AND ALSO WE DIDN'T WANNA DO A A LOOKY LIKEY. MICHAEL DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE STEVE, AS YOU SAY. I LOOK NOTHING LIKE JOANNA HOFFMAN EITHER. AND IT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT JUST CAPTURING THE ESSENCE OF WHO THESE PEOPLE WERE AND IT DOESN'T COVER THE LAST STAGES OF HIS LIFE. IT ONLY FEATURES ONE MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY, HIS DAUGHTER LISA. AND SO IT SHOWS ANOTHER SIDE OF STEVE JOBS THAT NONE OF US HAVE REALLY HEARD ABOUT. YOU KNOW, HE'S KNOWN FOR BEING THAT GUY WHO WAS VERY INTIMIDATING AND APPARENTLY NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO WORK FOR. BUT ACTUALLY YOU ACCESS A MUCH MORE HUMAN AND REALLY QUITE LOVELY SIDE OF HIM AT TIMES IN THE FILM.
Jimmy: AND WHO YOU PLAY IS KIND OF THE LONGEST, BIGGEST RELATION-WISE -- RELATIONSHIP-WISE WITH HIM.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I MEAN, HE COULD BE NASTY, WHATEVER IT IS, BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE. YOU'RE THE PERSON THAT COULD TELL HIM, HEY, STOP IT. WE'RE DOING THIS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: NO ONE COULD REALLY TALK TO HIM.
SHE WAS -- SHE WAS VERY STRONG. I MEAN, THE REAL JOANNA HOFFMAN IS A VERY WARM ACTUALLY, QUITE GENTLE PERSON, BUT SHE DOES HAVE A STRENGTH. SHE'S EASTERN EUROPEAN, SHE WAS BORN IN POLAND, LIVED IN ARMENIA. SOME OF HER FAMILY WAS SPEAKING RUSSIAN. CAME TO AMERICA AS A TEENAGER. SO SHE'S GOTTA KIND OF --
Jimmy: THAT'S AN EASY ACCENT TO DO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT MUST HAVE BEEN FUN.
DARLING, LET ME TELL YOU.
Jimmy: THAT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE, WAIT, WHAT DO I DO?
REALLY, IT DROVE ME A LITTLE BIT NUTS, ACTUALLY, BUT IT'S A A LOT OF FUN. YOU KNOW, I DO LOVE DOING ACCENTS.
Jimmy: BUT WITH ALL THAT RAT-A-TAT-TAT. THAT DIALOGUE, AARON SORKIN.
IT'S SORKIN DIALOGUE, SO IT'S EXTREMELY FAST PACED. YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY I'VE GOTTA SAY, IT WAS SO MUCH FUN MAKING THIS FILM. AND WE REALLY ALL HAD AN INCREDIBLE TIME, AND MICHAEL FASSBENDER IS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY ACTOR. I HAVE TO HAND IT TO HIM. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DID IT. IT'S 182 PAGES OF DIALOGUE, AND HE'S ON EVERY SINGLE PAGE.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. HERE'S KATE WINSLET OPPOSITE MICHAEL FASSBENDER IN "STEVE JOBS" IN LIMITED RELEASE FRIDAY. CHECK THIS OUT.

Jimmy: OH, WOW. I WAS GOING TO SAY, YOU LOOK LIKE A 9-YEAR-OLD. [ APPLAUSE ] HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY. NOW, WHAT IS THIS INVENTION YOU GOT FOR US HERE?
WELL, IT'S CALLED THE BACK SCRATCHER 2.0. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU PUT IT, UM --
Jimmy: WHY IS IT 2.0?
WELL, IT'S 2.0 BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE, MY CAT HUDSON, HE WAS PLAYING WITH THE STRING, AND THEN IT RIPPED OFF SOME OF THE TAPE. AND HE DISCOVERED TAPE AND IT RIPPED OFF THE WHOLE THING.
Jimmy: YEAH, HE DISCOVERED IT. YEAH, THERE YOU GO. NOW, HOW DO WE DO THE BACK SCRATCHER HERE?
YOU PUT IT ON YOUR HEAD. AND YOU STICK THIS DOWN YOUR SHIRT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LIKE A HAIR BRUSH HERE? HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS INVENTION?
MY MOM WAS HAVING TROUBLE SCRATCHING HER BACK BECAUSE WE WENT TO MY GRANDMA'S HOUSE IN ARKANSAS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND UM.
Jimmy: YOU WERE IN ARKANSAS AND SHE HAD TO SCRATCH HER BACK. IT'S TOUGH TO DO IN ARKANSAS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S BEEN ILLEGAL FOR YEARS NOW, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
A COUPLE DAYS AGO, A COUPLE DAYS AGO, BEFORE THAT HAPPENED, I LEARNED ABOUT LEVERS IN SCHOOL. SO I INVENTED THE BACK SCRATCHER 2.0.
Jimmy: OH COOL. SO NOW, HOW DO I DO IT?
YOU TAKE THIS AND PULL IT UP AND DOWN AND THEN IT SCRATCHES YOUR BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH. YEAH. FANTASTIC, BUDDY. HEY, THAT'S A GREAT INVENTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, BUDDY. THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE INVENTION. IT'S ALMOST AS INCREDIBLE AS MY INVENTION.

BUT DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN YOU'RE EATING THEM AND YOU CAN'T REACH THE BOTTOM OF THE CAN BECAUSE YOUR HAND CAN'T FIT IN THERE? HOW ABOUT THIS? PROBLEM SOLVED. GOT A TINY DOOR HERE ON THE SIDE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOW GET OUT OF HERE! ♪♪
Steve: THAT'S AN INVENTION.
Jimmy: LET ME WELCOME OUR NEXT INVENTOR. COME ON OVER HERE. ♪♪ HI, PAL. I REMEMBER YOU. YOU CAME ON OUR SHOW BEFORE. YOU HAD ANOTHER GREAT INVENTION, IT WAS A FLASHLIGHT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT IT WAS POWERED BY HEAT FROM YOUR HANDS.
CORRECT.
Jimmy: VERY GOOD. NOW YOU HAVE A NEW INVENTION. WHAT IS THIS ONE YOU CAME UP WITH?
THIS IS CALLED THE E-DRINK. AND I BASICALLY --
Jimmy: THE E-DRINK.
THE E-DRINK.
Jimmy: THE ELECTRONIC DRINK.
WOW, YOU GUESSED IT. OKAY, WOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A LITTLE CONDESCENDING THERE. IT'S YOUR LAST APPEARANCE ON THE SHOW, SO MAKE, YOU BETTER ENJOY IT NOW. NO, I'M KIDDING. I'M JOKING. TELL ME ABOUT THIS. I LOVE THIS IDEA.
I GOT THE IDEA FOR THE E-DRINK WHEN THERE WERE TWO MAIN PROBLEMS THAT MY FELLOW TEENAGE FRIENDS.
Jimmy: WE GET IT. YOU'RE YOUNG AND I'M OLD, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
RIGHT. SO THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS THAT THEIR PHONES AND iPODS ARE ALWAYS RUNNING OUT OF BATTERY.
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
BIG ISSUE. VERY SERIOUS. THE SECOND PROBLEM WAS THAT THEIR COFFEE WAS TAKING TOO LONG TO COOL DOWN. AND WHEN YOU'RE A STUDENT, YOU DRINK A LOT. SO I WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS. SO WHAT THE E-DRINK DOES IS IT RECOVERS SOME OF THE LOST HEAT OF YOUR DRINK WHILE YOU'RE WAITING FOR IT TO COOL DOWN AND CONVERTS IT INTO ELECTRICITY. SO YOU EVENTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH CHARGE TO GIVE YOUR iPOD OR iPHONE A LITTLE BOOST OF ENERGY.
Jimmy: INTERESTING. LET'S SEE THIS THING IN ACTION. I GOT SOME HOT WATER HERE.
PERFECT.
Jimmy: BE CAREFUL, YEAH. MAGICAL. I'M JUST GOING --
Jimmy: IT'S NOT MAGICAL. IT'S JUST HOT WATER. [ LAUGHTER ]
I MEAN, IT CAME FROM BELOW THERE. WE DON'T KNOW IT WAS THERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S THE MAGIC. I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE. NO, JUST BOILED WATER. WATCH YOUR HAND, THOUGH.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: BE CAREFUL, PLEASE. ALL RIGHT, SO YOU POUR IN HOT WATER THERE, YEAH?
YEAH.
Jimmy: NOW IT'S TOO HOT FOR ME TO DRINK. SO, I'M LIKE BUMMED OUT.
OKAY.
Jimmy: AND MY PHONE IS NOT EVEN CHARGED. SO, NOW WHAT DO YOU DO? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M HAVING AN AWFUL DAY.
OKAY. I'M GOING TO SWITCH THIS ON, AND IT WILL -- THERE.
Jimmy: HEY, LOOK AT THAT. IT WORKS. [ APPLAUSE ]
A LITTLE LATE.
Jimmy: I LIKE THAT. THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE, PAL. CONGRATULATIONS. I KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. I SAY PRETTY IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE IT'S NOT QUITE AS IMPRESSIVE AS SOMETHING I MADE. [ LAUGHTER ] PREPARE FOR YOUR MIND TO BE BLOWN. IT'S GOING TO BE MAGICAL.
OKAY
Jimmy: YEAH. COME HERE, PAL. LOOK. IT'S A GIANT MINION PEZ DISPENSER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HERE'S THE DEAL. RIGHT? HERE'S THE DEAL. YOU'RE IN YOUR DORM. IT'S LATE AT NIGHT. YOU'RE HUNGRY. YOU PULL BACK THE HEAD OF YOUR PEZ DISPENSER, RIGHT? EXCEPT YOU DON'T GET PEZ. YOU GET RAMEN NOODLES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ YOU GOT BEEF? I'M JUST SAYING, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THIS. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THIS. I MEAN, YEAH, FANTASTIC. WHENEVER YOU WANT. I MEAN, YOUR CUP, YOUR COFFEE MUG IS COOL, I GUESS. BUT I MEAN, IT MIGHT SAVE THE WORLD, BUT THIS IS SOLVING A A PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST YET. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I MEAN, THERE YOU GO, HOSS.
I'LL TAKE THIS.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, PAL. TAKE CARE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. CONGRATULATIONS. YOU CAN KEEP THOSE NOODLES. GET THOSE NOODLES. GET THOSE NOODLES BACK. THEY'RE NOT FREE NOODLES, WE'RE NOT GIVING OUT NOODLES HERE.

NO, YOU DON'T EAT IT.
Jimmy: WELL, IT'S A VERY CONFUSING NAME. I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU DID EAT IT. WHAT DO I DO, I DRINK FROM IT?
