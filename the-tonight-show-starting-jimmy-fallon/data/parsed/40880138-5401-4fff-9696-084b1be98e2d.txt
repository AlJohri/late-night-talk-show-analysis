Questlove: 144!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH -- BEAUTIFUL CROWD! BEAUTIFUL NEW YORK CITY CROWD. WELCOME, WELCOME! WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS ] OH, FEELS GOOD. GOOD TO SEE YOU. WE GOT A FUN SHOW TONIGHT. BUT FIRST WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE WEEKEND TO ATTEND A FUND-RAISER HOSTED BY THE CREATOR OF FARMVILLE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. OBAMA AND THE CREATOR OF FARMVILLE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON BECAUSE THEY BOTH REALLY WISH IT WAS STILL 2009. IT WAS A GREAT YEAR FOR BOTH. [ APPLAUSE ] I ALSO SAW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA PLAYED HIS 200th ROUND OF GOLF YESTERDAY. DEMOCRATS ARE LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT? HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS AS LONG AS HE'S NOT TRYING TO CAMPAIGN FOR US." I MEAN THAT'S JUST -- [ LAUGHTER ] DID YOU SEE THIS? FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA WENT TO IOWA THIS WEEK TO CAMPAIGN FOR SENATE CANDIDATE BRUCE BRALEY. OKAY, HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN CRITICIZED FOR BEING TOO CLOSE TO THE OBAMAS. ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW HOW CLOSE THEY ARE BECAUSE JUST LISTEN TO WHAT THE FIRST LADY CALLS THIS GUY WHOSE NAME IS BRUCE BRALEY. HERE HE IS.
YOUR NEXT SENATOR FROM IOWA, OUR FRIEND, BRUCE BAILEY. YOU NEED TO ELECT BRUCE BAILEY -- LEADERS LIKE BRUCE BAILY -- SWING FOR BRUCE BAILEY -- GO TO VOTE.BRUCEBAILEY.COM. THAT'S BRALEY, WHAT DID I SAY? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, NO, NO, NO. OH NO. TOUGH FOR MICHELLE OBAMA. IF ONLY HIS NAME WAS ON A A MILLION SIGNS AROUND HER JUST TO REMIND HER WHAT HIS NAME WAS. [ LAUGHTER ] AT THIS POINT, IT WOULD BE EASY IF HE JUST CHANGED HIS NAME TO BAILEY. WE GOT A LOT OF MOMENTUM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WON'T YOU COME HOME BRUCE BAILEY. NEVERMIND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. I READ THAT DUE TO LAST YEAR'S OBAMACARE DIFFICULTIES THE WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO LOWER EXPECTATIONS FOR THE SECOND ROUND OF OBAMA CARE ENROLLMENT. YEAH. BUT I SAW SOME OF THE ADS.
Steve: DID YOU?
Jimmy: YEAH. I THINK THEY'RE SETTING THE BAR TOO LOW. YEAH. BECAUSE LOOK AT THE FIRST ONE HERE. OBAMACARE, LIKE YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE SARCASTIC. IT JUST SOUNDS SARCASTIC TO ME. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE HERE. OBAMACARE, LAUGHTER'S THE BEST MEDICINE. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A A DIFFERENT TYPE OF TREATMENT. YEAH AND FINALLY THERE'S OBAMACARE, IT'S NOT WORSE THAN NOT HAVING NO HEALTH INSURANCE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CONFUSING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: LIKE A TRIPLE NEGATIVE.
Jimmy: AND GET THIS, GUYS, A A NEW POLL FOUND THAT 58% OF MILLENIALS, THAT'S THE PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN THE '90s. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] US. [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN THE '90s.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: THEY WOULD VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON IF SHE RAN FOR PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. YEAH, SHE'S A SHOE-IN WITH MILLENNIALS UNLESS URKEL DECIDES TO RUN. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN IT'S A TIGHT RACE. [ URKEL VOICE ] DID I DO THAT? NO, ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T. IT WAS THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DID NOT DO THAT. YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT HE'D SAY --
Steve: THAT'S WHAT HE'D SAY.
Jimmy: YEAH, MY VICE PRESIDENT, A POWER RANGER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW YOU'D THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S FUNNY. BUT I'D THINK ABOUT IT. MORE POLITICAL NEWS. LAST WEEK FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE THREATENED TO QUIT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY -- [ CHEERS ] -- NOT FINISHED.
Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THREATENED, HE THREATENED TO QUIT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IF THE GOP GIVES UP THE FIGHT AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE. WHEN ASKED WHERE HE'LL GO, HUCKABEE JUST SAID, "I'LL JUST SWITCH SIDES." [ LAUGHTER ] "I MEAN -- I MEAN -- NO, NO, NO, I MEANT -- NO, NO, NO. I MEANT I'LL GO PLAY FOR THE OTHER TEAM." [ LAUGHTER ] "NO, NO, WAIT, WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS I'LL BECOME A GAY MAN." [ LAUGHTER ] "ALRIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS INTERVIEW IS OVER. I'M TIRED OF TALKING -- I'VE SAID TOO MUCH ALREADY." [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS WATCHING "60 MINUTES" LAST NIGHT AND I SAW PART TWO OF THEIR INTERVIEW WITH FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY, AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT CYBER CRIMINALS. WHAT HE'S SAYING -- HE'S SAYING THE FBI WANTS CYBER CRIMINALS TO, QUOTE, BE LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS. SOMEHOW, I DON'T GET THE FEELING THEY'RE AFRAID OF HIM AT ALL. IN FACT I THINK THEY EVEN HACKED THE NEWS FEED DURING THE INTERVIEW. TAKE A LOOK, SEE IF YOU --
WE CANNOT READ YOUR E-MAILS OR LISTEN TO YOUR CALLS WITHOUT GOING TO A FEDERAL JUDGE MAKING A SHOWING OF PROBABLE CAUSE -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- THAT YOU ARE A TERRORIST, AN AGENT OF A FOREIGN POWER OR A A SERIOUS CRIMINAL OF SOME SORT, WE CAN GET PERMISSION FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME TO INTERCEPT THOSE COMMUNICATIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S AN EXTREMELY BURDENSOME PROCESS AND I LIKE IT THAT WAY.
Jimmy: I MEAN -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S PRETTY HARD TO DO THAT.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THEN THIS IS JUST WEIRD. ON SATURDAY, FOX NEWS COMMENTATOR GERALDO RIVERA TWEETED ABOUT THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS -- RIGHT?
Steve: RIGHT.
Jimmy: BUT HE ALSO INCLUDED A SHIRTLESS PHOTO OF HIMSELF ALONG WITH THE TWEET. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. [ AUDIENCE GROANS ]

Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] EH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: THIS IS COOL GUYS. THE ICE SKATING RINK HERE AT ROCKEFELLER CENTER OPENED TODAY.
Steve: YEAH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S THAT SPECIAL TIME OF YEAR WHEN TOURISTS ARE LIKE, "THIS WAS WORTH 45 BUCKS, RIGHT?" [ LAUGHTER ] IS THIS WORTH 45? ANOTHER LOCAL STORY. A NEW SURVEY FOUND THAT PEOPLE IN NEW YORK ARE THE MOST GENEROUS TIPPERS AT RESTAURANTS. [ CHEERS ] YOU CAN TELL THE MONEY'S GOOD BECAUSE THE OTHER DAY I MET AN ACTRESS WHO DREAMS OF BECOMING A WAITRESS. AND YOU GO, WAIT THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER ] I'M ONLY GONNA BE AN ACTOR FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEN -- [ APPLAUSE ] SOME BUSINESS NEWS. LEGO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE ENDING THEIR TOY DEAL WITH SHELL OIL IN PROTEST OF SHELL'S PROPOSAL TO DO ARCTIC DRILLING. SO YEAH, NO MORE TOYS YOU CAN BUY AT GAS STATIONS, LEGO GAS STATION, THEY WON'T BE SHELL ANY MORE. NO THEY'RE NOT DOING THIS BUT SHELL DIDN'T SEEM TO BE BOTHERED BY THIS, THE LEGO DEAL. THEY STRUCK UP A NUMBER OF NEW TOY DEALS JUST IN TIME FOR THE BIG CHRISTMAS SEASON. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S CLEAN ME OFF, ELMO, WHICH IS A GREAT ONE. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Steve: SO GOOD.

Steve: REALLY FAST. 40 WEIGHT, YEAH.
Jimmy: CHECK THIS OUT GUYS, RUNNERS FROM KENYA CAME IN FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD IN THE CHICAGO MARATHON YESTERDAY. YEAH, EVEN CRAZIER ALL THREE RUNNERS TURNED OUT TO BE ONE DUDE LAPPING EVERYONE. LIKE, "HEY WHAT'S UP MAN? SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OH, NO, THIS IS TOO BAD, HIGGINS.
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: DURING A RECENT INTERVIEW HUGH GRANT ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL NO LONGER STAR IN "BRIDGET JONES 3."
Steve: WHAT? [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, NOPE. SOURCES SAY GRANT HAS BEEN UNHAPPY WITH THE SCRIPT FOR YEARS, IT JUST TOOK HIM FOREVER TO SAY IT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ HUGH GRANT IMPRESSION ] UH, JUST THE THING IS, ACTUALLY -- THE SCRIPT -- PROPERLY, UM, TO GET -- OF COURSE, ACTUALLY, VERY -- NO, I WON'T BE DOING IT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST SAY IT. AND FINALLY, NEW STUDY HAS FOUND THAT BABIES WHO WEIGH MORE WHEN THEY'RE BORN GROW UP TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. THAT'S RIGHT. KIDS WHO ARE FATTER ARE ALSO SMARTER. OR AS THE BULLIES CALL IT, THE PERFECT STORM. [ LAUGHTER ] FAT NERD! WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW.

Jimmy: YOU WERE.
YEAH, I WAS A NANNY. THE KIDS WERE OLDER. AND --

IT'S A JOKE.
Jimmy: IT'S A JOKE. MORE OF AN E-CIG. [ LAUGHTER ] I GOTTA SAY CONGRATS ON "BIRDMAN." ANOTHER FUN THING THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED IN. WHAT A COOL, COOL MOVIE. THEY JUST HAD THE PREMIERE HERE IN NEW YORK, AND I SAW YOU -- I SAW YOU WERE THERE.
OH YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. I SAW YOU WERE GOING UP AND DOWN THE RED CARPET.
OH, I LIVE ON THE CARPET. [ LAUGHTER ] I LIVE FOR THE CARPET.
Jimmy: YOU LIVE FOR THE CARPET.
SALT OF THE EARTH PEOPLE THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAIT A SECOND. I SENSE A LITTLE SARCASM.
WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THERE'S EXCITEMENT AND YOU KIND OF HAVE TO FEIGN THIS EXCITEMENT, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO BE, YOU KNOW, ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT ARE -- I FIND ARE -- THE QUESTIONS ARE BORING, AND SO I TRY TO LIVEN IT UP A BIT. AND THIS WOMAN ON THE RED CARPET WAS, SHE SAID, "OH, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU LOST SOME WEIGHT." AND I JUST LOOKED AT HER AND I WENT, "YEAH, I'M DYING." [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE GOES, "HA HA, SO WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?" OR WHATEVER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAIT A SECOND. DID YOU EVEN HEAR WHAT I SAID?
NO, NO. THEY DON'T PAY ATTENTION.
Jimmy: NO, THEY AREN'T EVEN PAYING ATTENTION.
THEY WANT YOU TO SCREW UP. THAT'S ALL THEY WANT YOU TO DO.
Jimmy: THEY'RE HOPING FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THIS MOVIE IS -- THE DIRECTOR OF THIS MOVIE DID SOME AMAZING THING. ALMOST LIKE THE WHOLE THING IS ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT.
YEAH, I THINK AROUND THREE-FOURTHS OF THE MOVIE LOOKS LIKE IT IS JUST ONE SHOT.
Jimmy: IT'S AMAZING.
YEAH. SO IT WAS -- WE HAD TO DO A LOT OF CHOREOGRAPHY FOR THE REHEARSALS AND STUFF. IT'S A REALLY IMPRESSIVE MOVIE FOR THAT ALONE.
Jimmy: THERE'S LIKE 15-MINUTE SCENES AT LEAST WHERE PEOPLE ARE TALKING AND CAMERON MOVES AND THEN SOMEONE GOES DOWN THE HALL WHERE ANOTHER SCENE BEGINS.
SO YOU KIND OF HAD TO HIDE BEHIND DOORS AND STUFF AND THEN PICK UP YOUR CUE. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO EXPLAIN IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT.
Jimmy: I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO STRESSED OUT. ID' BE LIKE -- YOU'RE STANDING WITH MICHAEL KEATON GOING LIKE, "NOT YET, HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO." [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, WHAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU -- THAT'S WHY I DON'T DO MOVIES ANY MORE.
THAT'S GOOD ACTING.
Jimmy: THAT IS NOT GOOD ACTING.
THAT'S GOOD ACTING.
Jimmy: THAT IS NOT GOOD ACTING. I TRIED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT I'D BE NERVOUS WHEN THE CAMERAS -- YOU COULD PROBABLY HEAR THE CAMERA SHUFFLING AND IT'S ME COMING CLOSER, YOU KNOW. LIKE, OH, MAN, HERE HE COMES.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: AND YOU BETTER NOT SCREW UP. BECAUSE IF YOU SCREW UP, THAT'S 15 MINUTES --
I KNOW. I THINK THE SOUND GUY TOLD ME ONCE HE HEARD ME GOING, "OKAY, HERE THEY COME, HERE THEY COME!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BECAUSE IT IS -- BUT IT'S GREAT ACTING AND SO FUN. AND THIS WHOLE THING WAS SHOT IN 30 DAYS?
30 DAYS, YEAH. SO THIS MOVIE WAS SHOT IN 30 DAYS. MOST MOVIES TAKE FOUR MONTHS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THIS MOVIE IS FOUR TIMES BETTER THAN ANY MOVIE I'VE SEEN. [ LAUGHTER ] SO MOVIES SHOULD JUST BE SHOT IN 30 DAYS AND STOP WASTING YOUR TIME. GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.
Jimmy: THEY REALLY SHOULD. YEAH, EXACTLY.
THE FACT THAT IT WAS SHOT IN 30 DAYS IS REALLY KIND OF AMAZING TO ME, YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO IMPRESSIVE. AND EVERYONE JUST KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK. MICHAEL KEATON PLAYS AN ACTOR WHO WAS IN THESE MOVIES CALLED "BIRDMAN." THREE OF THEM. "BIRDMAN 3" IS A POSTER HANGING ON THIS WALL. SO ALMOST LIKE BATMAN, LET'S JUST SAY. WHICH MICHAEL KEATON REALLY PLAYED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, UH, AND THEN HE LEFT, HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO "BIRDMAN 4" AND THEN HE KINDA JUST FELL OFF THE RADAR, BUT NOW HE'S STILL OUT THERE. HE WROTE AND DIRECTED THIS PLAY. HE WANTS TO COME BACK OUT AND JUST HAVE PEOPLE GO LIKE -- RESPECT HIM AS A RESPECTABLE ACTOR THAT HE ACTUALLY IS. AND HE'S TRYING TO FIGHT THAT OLD --
EGO DEMON-TYPE THING THAT KIND OF HAUNTS ALL OF US BUT ACTORS TEND TO -- OR ENTERTAINERS, I FEEL LIKE --
Jimmy: YEAH.
--HAVE THIS VOICE IN THEIR HEAD ABOUT DOING BETTER OR PUSHING YOURSELF. SO IT'S KIND OF THE INNER WORKINGS OF A BROADWAY PLAY, BUT IT'S ALSO THE INNER WORKINGS OF THIS ACTOR'S MIND AND WHAT'S GOING THROUGH HIS MIND WITH THIS KIND OF WEIRD BREAKDOWN THAT HE'S KIND OF HAVING IN HIS HEAD BECAUSE OF HIS EGO.
Jimmy: AND YOU GET TO SEE EVERY SIDE OF HIM. YOU GET TO SEE HIS FAMILY COME VISIT HIM BECAUSE HE'S AT OPENING NIGHT AND THIS BIG BROADWAY SHOW. YOU GET TO SEE OTHER ACTORS COME IN OUT OF THIS PLAY AND DO THEIR SCENES AND THEN THEY'LL DO THE SCENE, THEN THEY'LL GO CUT AND THEN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO -- IT'S ACTORS ACTING AS ACTORS, IS THAT --
YEAH, IT'S VERY LAYERED.
Jimmy: THAT'S A TRICKY MOVE.
YES, IT'S VERY LAYERED.
Jimmy: EDWARD NORTONWAS -- I WAS LIKE, THAT'S PHENOMENAL.
I THINK EDWARD NORTON SHOULD, I MEAN, WHAT HE DID -- I MEAN, TRUST ME, I DON'T LIKE TO BLOW SMOKE UP ACTOR'S REAR ENDS.
Jimmy: YES, YOU DO.
I MEAN, LITERALLY I DO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YES, YES, BUT NOT --
BUT NOT FIGURATIVELY.
Jimmy: NOT FIGURATIVELY, YEAH. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING.
THAT GOT AN APPLAUSE.
Jimmy: VERY WELL DESERVED.
I'M LOOKING FOR THE APPLAUSE SIGN.
Jimmy: THERE IS NONE.
THERE' NO ONE.
Jimmy: NO BUT HE REALLY -- I WAS LIKE THAT'S SO TRICKY TO COME IN AND OUT AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING THE PROCESS GO AND HE'S GETTING INTO HIS CHARACTER. EVERYONE JUST DID SUCH A GREAT JOB. THE SCRIPT WAS GREAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THEN YOU -- SO WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOW A CLIP HERE OF "BIRDMAN." AND THIS IS AFTER -- MICHAEL KEATON'S JUST HAVING A A MELTDOWN BECAUSE HE HIRED THIS NEW ACTOR AND IT'S JUST -- THE GUY'S SUCH A METHOD ACTOR HE'S RUINING THE PLAY. AND HE'S GOT EVERYTHING -- MICHEAL KEATON'S GOT EVERYTHIGN RIDING ON THIS, INCLUDING HIS HOUSE, EVERY SINGLE THING.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HERE'S A CLIP. ZACH GALIFIANAKIS AND MICHAEL KEATON IN "BIRDMAN." TAKE A LOOK.
HEY, WAIT.

WE CANNOT DO THAT.
OF COURSE WE CAN DO THAT. IT'S OUR SHOW.
WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME --
NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME, GET HIM THE -- OUT OF MY PLAY. I'M NOT GOING TO STAND UP THERE.
IT'S A PREVIEW, NOBODY GIVES A -- ABOUT A PREVIEW. NOTHING MATTERS UNTIL THAT OLD BAT FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES IS SITTING IN THAT AUDIENCE OPENING NIGHT.
NO. WE'RE GETTING RID OF HIM. I DON'T GIVE A -- ABOUT --
JUST SHUT UP! SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO ME FOR ONCE! AS SOON AS WE ANNOUNCED HE WAS TAKING OVER THE ADVANCE DOUBLED, AND THAT TOOK LESS THAN A DAY! WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THE PREVIEW, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE ANY MORE MONEY, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE MIKE. THIS IS ABOUT BEING RESPECTED AND VALIDATED. REMEMBER, THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME. AND THEN YOU GOT ME IN -- YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR. GET HIM UNDER CONTROL, OKAY? [ BLEEP ] THIS ISN'T THE NINETIES, SEYMOUR. YOUR ZIPPER'S DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU GUYS MIGHT WANT TO GET YOUR BLEEPS IN ORDER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GOOD THING IT'S NOT GOING IN THERE.
I DON'T THINK THEY CAN TELL WHAT I WAS SAYING. I THINK THEY THOUGHT I SAID FUDGE.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. SO IF YOU HEAR ONE EXTRA -- ONE THAT SOUNDED LIKE A BOOP, THAT WAS ONE THAT WE MISSED. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, SORRY FOR THAT, FOLKS. HE WAS SAYING FUDGE.

OH, MY GOSH, TURN THE [ BLEEP ] AROUND.
WHAT? [ GASPS ]
YEAH. SO YOU KNOW, WILL YOU MARRY ME?
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL RING.
OKAY, EVERYONE. COME ON OUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
EVERYBODY'S HERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME CASEY WILSON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE, PAL.
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. CONGRATS ON THE FUNNY SHOW. NOW THIS IS A SHOW ABOUT A A COUPLE GETTING MARRIED?
YES, THEY HAVE A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THE PROPOSAL.
Jimmy: I LOVE, YES, YES. IT'S SORT OF CLOSE TO REAL LIFE BECAUSE YOU RECENTLY JUST GOT MARRIED.
I DID.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DID.
Jimmy: NOW, YOU GOT MARRIED TO THE SHOW'S CREATOR.
YES.
Jimmy: THE CREATOR OF THIS SHOW.
YES.
Jimmy: SO WAS THAT -- DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WAS GOING TO PROPOSE? DID IT GO SMOOTHER THAN THAT?
IT WENT SMOOTHER THAN THAT. I DID KNOW HE WAS GOING TO PROPOSE BECAUSE HE'S A HORRIBLE ACTOR. HE'S A GOOD WRITER. AND HE'S NEVER MADE ONE PLAN IN OUR ENTIRE LIFE. IT'S ALWAYS LIKE, "IT'S MY MOM'S BIRTHDAY, COME RIGHT NOW." AND HE SAID, "IN FOUR MONTHS FROM NOW, I THINK WE SHOULD JUST STAY IN, KIND OF HANG HOME." I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?"
Jimmy: HE WAITED FOUR MONTHS?
YEAH, IN FOUR MONTHS. AND HE'S LIKE --
Jimmy: JUST LIKE CASUAL?
IT'S COOL IF YOU CAN'T, BUT PLEASE TELL ME IF YOU CAN'T JUST HANG HOME AND ORDER IN FOOD. SO OF COURSE I KNEW, AND I DID GET MY NAILS AND A NICE BLOW DRY. I MEAN I'M NOT AN ANIMAL.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE. AND YOU'RE NOT AN ANIMAL. AND IT WAS A NICE SWEET PROPOSAL? EVERYTHING WENT GREAT?
VERY SWEET, YES.
Jimmy: AND ANY SURPRISE LIKE THAT -- WAS THE FAMILY THERE OR NO?
FAMILY, YES. HE HAD MY DAD AND BROTHER FLY IN AND HIS FAMILY CAME IN. IT WAS VERY NICE.
Jimmy: SO THAT'S FUN. AND THE WEDDING WENT SMOOTHLY?
THE WEDDING WAS SMOOTHISH. I MEAN, I DID TAKE A FALL, A A PRETTY BIG FALL ON THE DANCE FLOOR. YEAH. IT WAS SO SAD BECAUSE IT WAS OBVIOUSLY DRUNKEN, BUT ALSO OVERZEALOUS. OVERZEALOUS DANCING.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
LOT OF DANCING. I FELL DOWN REALLY HARD DOWN. BUT THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE CRYING BUT I'M LIKE, "GET BACK OUT THERE, GIRL, GET BACK UP." [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT RIGHT BACK UP. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO PUT ON THE SHOW FOR EVERYBODY. THEY'RE WATCHING. THEY'RE ALL LIKE, "OOH, THAT WAS ROUGH."
IT WAS A GASP AND THEN -- NOBODY WAS PLEASED WHEN I GOT BACK UP. EVERYONE KNEW I WAS VERY HURT. AND THEN I HAD TO -- OUR HONEYMOON WAS THE NEXT DAY AND AT THE AIRPORT I HAD TO HAVE MY HUSBAND WHEEL ME IN A A WHEELCHAIR. WHICH IS NOT LIKE THE DAY AFTER YOU'RE MARRIED WHAT YOU WANT. FOR YOUR HUSBAND TO BE WHEELING YOU AROUND.
Jimmy: LIKE, "SO FAR SO GREAT, THIS IS AWESOME."
LIKE, WOW. YOU ARE A HUNDRED IMMEDIATELY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW WERE THE SPEECHES? ANY DRUNKEN PEOPLE GET UP THERE AND DO ANYTHING SILLY?
NO, BUT THE SPEECHES WERE -- I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE TIME WHEN ALL MY GIRLFRIENDS, EVERYONE WOULD GET UP THERE AND KIND OF EXTOL MY VIRTUES. AND FOR MY HUSBAND, EVERYONE WAS LIKE -- YOU KNOW, HE SAT BEDSIDE DURING MY CANCER TREATMENT. HE MOVED HOME WHEN I FELL ILL. AND FOR ME IT WAS LIKE, "SHE'S A MESS." AND PEOPLE WERE JUST VERY FRIENDLY BUT THEY'RE LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE REALLY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO WORK THROUGH YOUR ANGER ISSUES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY NEVER SAID THAT.
IT WAS A ROAST. EACH PERSON WAS LIKE, "WELL, WE'VE TRIED WITH HER OVER THE YEARS." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE WORST. FOR HIM THEY HAD THIS REALLY NICE STORY.
BEAUTIFUL, YEAH.
Jimmy: SO CONGRATS. THERE WAS ANOTHER FAMOUS COUPLE GETTING MARRIED THE SAME WEEKEND.
YES.
Jimmy: KIM AND KANYE.
KIMYE, YES.
Jimmy: KIMYE, YEAH.
KIMYE.
Jimmy: KIMYE, YEAH. KIM-YEE, KIMYE, KIM-YEEZUS, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY.
KIM-YEEZUS! KIM-YASHIAN. WHATEVER YOU WANT.
Jimmy: SO THEY GOT MARRIED AND SO YOU KIND OF WANTED TO INCORPORATE THEIR LOVE, THEIR SPECIAL MOMENT INTO YOUR MOMENT.
I DID. I GAVE OUT SOME STICKERS AT THE WEDDING. I THINK WE HAVE ONE HERE. BECAUSE IT WAS TWO HUGE STARS GETTING MARRIED ON THAT DAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CAVID.
CAVID. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IS THAT HOW YOU PRONOUNCE CAVID?
THAT'S RIGHT. CAH-VEED.
Jimmy: CAH-VEED.
CAH-VEED.
Jimmy: CAH-VEED. YEAH. YOU GAVE OUT THESE STICKERS WHICH IS GREAT.
YES.
Jimmy: YOU ALSO GAVE OUT THESE COOL KEY CHAINS.
I DID.
Jimmy: WHICH IS GREAT.
THERE IS AN INTERESTING STORY BEHIND THIS KEY CHAIN. THIS IS MY FATHER. AND THIS IS A PORTRAIT THAT MY FATHER TOOK OF HIMSELF. THAT HE GAVE TO MY BROTHER AND I THIS LAST CHRISTMAS, AND HE --
Jimmy: THIS IS THE BEST STORY. I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR DAD. I NEVER MET YOUR DAD. JUST HEARING THIS STORY MADE ME JUST GO --
HE'S A WONDERFUL MAN, BUT ON CHRISTMAS MORNING HE PUT A A PIECE OF TWINE UNDER THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND SAID, "FOLLOW THIS TO YOUR GIFT," WHICH IS STRANGE. SO THE TWINE WRAPPED ALL THE WAY AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE, UPSTAIRS AND LED TO A CLOSET. I THOUGHT IT WAS A DEAD BODY JUMPING OUT.
Jimmy: NO YOU DIDN'T. YOU'D THINK IT WAS LIKE A A MOPED. I DON'T KNOW, SOMETHING --
-- SOMETHING COOL.
Jimmy: YEAH!
IT WAS A SELF-PORTRAIT THAT MY FATHER SAT FOR, A PHOTOGRAPH THAT WAS THEN PAINTED OVER OF HIMSELF LOOKING LIKE A TJ MAXX PRESIDENT OR A COUNTRY CLUB OWNER IN A MUSTARD BLAZER. AND THE SIZE OF IT IS SO ENORMOUS THAT I HAVE BROUGHT IT BECAUSE I NEED YOU ALL TO SEE, I THINK, FOR YOURSELVES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S REALLY HERE. WE'LL TAKE A PEEK AT IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU. ♪♪ CAN I COME OVER THERE?
Jimmy: SO THIS IS WHAT YOU FOUND AT THE END OF THE TWINE?
THIS WAS AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW.
Jimmy: THIS WAS AT THE END OF -- THIS IS THE ORIGINAL, THIS IS FROM VIRGINIA.
YEAH, FROM VIRGINIA, ALEXANDRIA. AND HE SAID HE FEELS THAT HE WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN HE TOOK THE PHOTO AND HE THINKS THAT SHINES THROUGH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT DEFINITELY DOES SHINE THROUGH.
IT DEFINITELY --
Jimmy: YOU DON'T HAVE ONE.
NO, AND YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: WHAT DID HE GIVE AS A A GIFT?
HE HAS NOT SENT IT TO ME YET. IT'S STILL HANGING IN HIS LIVING ROOM, BECAUSE HE'S SO ATTACHED TO IT. AND IT YOU'LL NOTICE THIS GORGEOUS DETAIL WORK.
Jimmy: OH, I MEAN, THIS IS A A GORGEOUS PAINTING.
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU ONE THING, HOW HE GOT IT. HE BOUGHT AN AUCTION, LIKE A A COUPON FOR IT AT AN AUCTION. HE GOES, IT WAS A THOUSAND DOLLARS OFF COUPON. JUST LIKE, HOW MUCH WAS IT?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN FIVE DOLLARS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S GREAT. WHAT IS YOUR DAD'S NAME?
PAUL.
Jimmy: PAUL. PAUL WILSON RIGHT THERE. THIS IS -- AND I WANT TO TAKE THE KEY CHAIN -- ON THE BACK, IT SAYS "THIS PORTRAIT OF PAUL WILSON COMES DIRECTLY FROM HIS HEART TO OUR WALLS TO YOUR KEYS. ENJOY." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. THE REAL PAUL WILSON. HE'S VERY PROUD OF HIS DAUGHTER. CASEY WILSON RIGHT THERE, YOU GUYS. "MARRY ME" PREMIERES TUESDAY AT 9:00 P.M. ON NBC. UP NEXT, STAND-UP FROM ANDREW ORVEDAHL. COME ON BACK. HE'S VERY FUNNY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST IS A A TALENTED COMEDIAN MAKING HIS NETWORK TELEVISION DEBUT WITH US TONIGHT. HE'LL BE PERFORMING AT THE COMEDY WORKS IN DENVER, COLORADO, NOVEMBER 3rd AND 4th. GIVE IT UP FOR ANDREW ORVEDAHL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT IS SUCH AN HONOR TO BE HERE. I'VE BEEN TRAVELING QUITE A BIT LATELY. I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TRAVELING SO MUCH THAT I MISSED MY DAUGHTER'S PRESCHOOL GRADUATION. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
YEAH, WHICH REALLY BUMMED ME OUT. I REMEMBERED YOU CAN'T MISS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY A A REAL THING. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THAT MADE ME FEEL BETTER. WHO CARES ABOUT PRESCHOOL GRADUATION? EVERYONE'S GRADUATING PRESCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT LIKE HIGH SCHOOL WHERE THE ELITE FEW HAVE MADE IT THROUGH THE GAUNTLET. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S PRESCHOOL. EVERYONE'S GOING FORWARD. NO ONE IS HELD BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'VE MET A PRESCHOOL GRADUATE? THEY'RE STILL SUPERDUMB, THEY'RE SO DUMB. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM GO FORWARD ANYWAY. OTHERWISE YOU'D END UP WITH A A 5-YEAR-OLD SAYING SOMETHING LIKE, I'M JUST GOING TO HOLD OFF ON KINDERGARTEN FOR A FEW YEARS, MAYBE WORK ON MYSELF FOR A A LITTLE WHILE. YOU END UP WITH SOME DUMPY HOUSE AND FIVE TODDLERS LIVING IN IT. YOU HAVE TO COME BY AND LOAN YOURS SOME MONEY, HAVE THE SAME CONVERSATION OVER AND OVER AGAIN. LIKE, HAVE YOU EVEN GIVE ANY THOUGHT TO KINDERGARTEN? I THINK YOU'RE KINDERGARTEN MATERIAL. [ LAUGHTER ] GET OFF MY BACK, DAD, I'M GOING TO SELL MY ART, OKAY? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO ONE WANTS YOUR MACARONI NECKLACES. THESE ARE TERRIBLE. THESE ARE THE WORST. [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT DIVORCED LAST YEAR. AND THERE'S THIS WEIRD PHENOMENON WHERE SOME ADULTS FORGET THAT I'M DIVORCED. LIKE, USUALLY I REMEMBER BECAUSE I'LL BE LIKE EATING PIZZA AND PLAYING WITH LEGOS AND DOING WHATEVER I WANT WITH MY TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] LIVING LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY WHOSE PARENTS ARE NEVER COMING HOME EVER AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SOMETIMES I'LL FORGET AND I'LL THINK THAT I LOST MY WEDDING RING. LIKE, I'LL JUST BE WALKING DOWN THE SIDEWALK AND I'VE GOT TAP MY THUMB ON MY RING FINGER LIKE AN OLD HABBIT. I'M LIKE, OH I LOST MY RING, DANG IT, I LOST MY WEDDING RING SOMEWHERE. I'M LIKE, OH YEAH, I DID. IN A CONVERSATION, AS IT TURNS OUT. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHERE THAT WENT. I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF YOGA SINCE MY DIVORCE. TONS OF YOGA. FIGURED NOW THAT I'M A SINGLE PARENT I CAN SORT OF REINVENT MY LIFE AS ANYTHING. WHY NOT BE A MOM. SO THAT'S BEEN GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
I WAS IN THE STORE RECENTLY BUYING SOME ICE CUBE TRAYS WHICH IS ANOTHER COOL DIVORCED DAD PURCHASE. ICE CUBE TRAYS. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND AS I WAS CHECKING OUT, THE CASHIER IS LIKE HEY YOU WANT TO KNOW A SECRET WITH THESE ICE CUBE TRAYS? AND I WAS LIKE YEAH, I WANT TO KNOW A SECRET. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WERE SECRETS WITH ICE CUBE TRAYS. WHAT'S THE SECRET? SHE SAID, IF YOU'RE HAVING A A HARD TIME GETTING YOUR KIDS TO DRINK WATER. MAKE KOOL-AID IN THIS ICE CUBE TRAY, AND THEN PUT THOSE KOOL-AID CUBES IN YOUR KIDS WATER. LIKE, WOW THAT'S A PRETTY COOL TRICK FOR GETTING YOUR KID TO DRINK KOOL-AID INSTEAD OF WATER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THERE'S A BETTER TRICK. IF YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING YOUR KID TO DRINK WATER, DON'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S THE CORE ELEMENTS OF LIFE. THEY'LL COME TO YOU FOR IT SOONER OR LATER. SOONER OR LATER KIDS COME AROUND FOR WATER SOONER OR LATER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A GREAT PARENTING PHILOSOPHY. ARE YOU HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING YOUR KID TO EAT VEGETABLES? JUST SPRINKLE SOME M&Ms ON TOP. [ LAUGHTER ] JAZZ IT UP. YOU HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING YOUR KID TO TAKE A FULL HEALTHY BREATH, JUST PUMP IN SOME HICKORY SMOKE. ARTIFICIAL HICKORY SMOKE. KIDS LOVE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I BOUGHT A FLASK A LITTLE WHILE AGO. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER PURCHASED A FLASK. [ CHEERS ] THANK YOU. BUT BUYING A FLASK FEELS LIKE IT'S SOME SORT OF WARNING SIGN ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, WHAT WAS THAT A CAR IN FLAMES GOING THROUGH A A GUARDRAIL? WHO CARES? I'M HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE. I JUST BOUGHT A PORTABLE REFILLABLE CONTAINER FOR BOOZE. THAT I CAN JUST HIDE IN MY POCKET AND SIP FROM WHENEVER THE NEED STRIKES ME. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS BOOZE IS SO HARD TO FIND. WHY IS IT? WHERE'S THE BOOZE? OH, IT'S RIGHT HERE IN MY POCKET. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S THE WEIRDEST THING ABOUT A FLASK, THOUGH, EVERYBODY'S COOL WITH A FLASK. ALWAYS. YOU'RE WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS, YOU PULL OUT A FLASK, THEY'RE LIKE HEY WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE, LITTLE FLASK. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S IN THAT, A LITTLE BOURBON? GIVE ME A SIP OF THAT. HEY, PASS THAT AROUND HERE. YOU PULL OUT A PLASTIC HALF PINT OF JIM BEAM AROUND WITH YOUR FRIENDS THEY'RE LIKE, "WHOA, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? DUDE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? YOUR SOCK? GET IT TOGETHER, HOBO." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT WITH A FLASK, NO THIS ONE'S METAL AND I KEEP FILLING IT UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THEY'RE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE A CLASS ACT. WAY TO GO." [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING ME HOP ON THE SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
