Jimmy: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE TONIGHT SHOW, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS ] GOOD LOOKIN' CROWD. WELL, HERE'S WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, TONIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. BEFORE HIS SPEECH, OBAMA SAID HE WAS A LITTLE MORE RELAXED, BECAUSE IT'S THE SIXTH TIME HE'S DONE IT. MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE TOO RELAXED, BECAUSE ALL HE SAID WAS "'SUP, AMERICA? WE GOOD?" [ LAUGHTER ] TOO CHILL. I NEED MORE THAN THAT. 'SUP, AMERICA, WE GOOD? THAT'S RIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE WAS A LITTLE MORE RELAXED THAN HE WAS OUT THE FIRST TIME -- THE FIRST TIME OUT. WHEN ASKED WHY HE WAS MORE RELAXED THIS TIME, THE PRESIDENT SAID, "I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] COLORADO." THEN YOU GO -- OH, YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT. COLORADO, DON'T -- [ APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, OBAMA SAID HE'S MORE RELAXED JUST BECAUSE HE'S ALL READY DONE IT SO MANY TIMES. INCIDENTALLY, MITT ROMNEY SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT REASONING FOR PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS MORE FUN THIS TIME. THE OBAMA'S INVITED 22 GUESTS TO THE SPEECH, INCLUDING A A FORMER CUBAN PRISONER, AN ASTRONAUT, AND A DOCTOR. EITHER THAT OR HE WAS SETTING UP THE WEIRDEST BAR JOKE OF ALL TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] AND ASTRONAUT SAYS TO THE DOCTOR -- NO, WAIT, THE DOCTOR SAYS -- NO, IT WAS A HORSE. WAIT A SECOND, A HORSE WAS IN THERE, NEVER MIND. I'M BAD AT THIS. ANOTHER ONE OF THE GUESTS WAS A A CEO OF CVS. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THIS YEAR, OBAMA'S SPEECH WAS PRINTED ON ONE LONG CVS RECEIPT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ALL I BOUGHT WAS SOME GUM. I'M HOLDING HALF A TREE IN MY HAND. LISTEN TO THIS. DURING A CONFERENCE YESTERDAY, POPE FRANCIS SPOKE ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL. AND SAID THAT CATHOLICS DON'T HAVE TO BREED LIKE, QUOTE, "RABBITS." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THE POPE KNEW HE WAS GETTING OUT OF HAND WHEN HE HAD TO BAPTIZE BABIES WITH A HOSE. COME ON, THIS IS TOO MANY KIDS. THIS IS TOO MANY. IT'S LIKE BONNAROO. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS JUST -- AND THIS IS KIND OF HARD TO BELIEVE HERE. I READ THAT THE NEW 169 PAGE G.E.D. TEST IS SO DIFFICULT, THAT AN IVY LEAGUE GRADUATE COULD NOT PASS IT. I MEAN, AT FIRST I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT, THEN I LOOKED AT THE TEST. I'VE GOT TO SAY, IT'S NOT THAT EASY. TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS HERE. "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD," EXPLORES THEMES OF RACE AND JUSTICE. WRITE A NOVEL THAT ALSO EXPLORES THESE THEMES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: GOSH.
Jimmy: I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
Steve: THAT'S HARD FOR A A TEST.
Jimmy: WITH ONE NUMBER TWO PENCIL?
Steve: NUMBER ONE, YOU WRITE A NOVEL? WOW.
Jimmy: HERE'S ANOTHER ONE HERE. ONE TRAIN IS TRAVELING 120 MILES PER HOUR EAST FROM CHICAGO. ANOTHER IS TRAVELING 90 MILES PER HOUR WEST FROM BALTIMORE. AT WHAT POINT DO THE CONDUCTORS REALIZE THEY'RE BROTHERS? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S ANOTHER ONE HERE. IF PLATO WERE ALIVE TODAY, WOULD HE D.J. OCCASIONALLY IN LOS ANGELES?

Jimmy: 1D. CHECK THIS OUT YOU GUYS -- I HAD IT WRITTEN ON MY HAND. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE ARE REPORTS THAT OVER 25 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH, THE LIBERACE FOUNDATION IS WORKING ON A TOUR THAT FEATURES A A HOLOGRAM OF LIBERACE. EVEN WEIRDER, HOLOGRAM LIBERACE WAS ONE OF 22 PEOPLE OBAMA INVITED TO THE STATE OF THE UNION TONIGHT. ISN'T THAT WEIRD? [ APPLAUSE ] A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT THE INVITE, EVEN NON-PEOPLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS. WHILE TIGER WOODS CHEERED ON HIS GIRLFRIEND, SKIER LINDSAY VAUGHN, IN ITALY - - YOU SAW THIS? MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOTICED HIS MISSING FRONT TOOTH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HIS TOOTH WAS KNOCKED OUT. HIS AGENT BLAMED IT ON HIS VIDEOGRAPHER HITTING HIM IN THE MOUTH WITH SOMETHING. WITH HIS CAMERA? I DON'T KNOW WHAT. BUT IT LOOKS PRETTY COOL TO US. I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS TIGER WOODS. THIS IS A REAL PHOTO. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THE BIGGER STORY IS THAT TIGER HAS APPARENTLY JOINED THE WU-TANG CLAN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S TIGER WOODS. GHOSTFACE SKIAH?

CRACKY?
NOT CRACKY?

Jimmy: WHAT? FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S NOT FAIR. CRACK WHORES ACTUALLY HAVE A A JOB. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, ONE OF THE GROUP DATES LAST NIGHT INVOLVED MILKING A GOAT AND DRINKING THE GOAT'S MILK RIGHT ON THE SPOT. LET'S SEE HOW THAT WENT OVER.
WARM.
I'M KIND OF GLAD I DIDN'T HAVE TO DRINK THE MILK, I'M NOT GONNA LIE. THE WAY KELSEY DESCRIBED IT, IT WAS SALTY AND WARM. IT'S NOT STUFF I LIKE IN MY MOUTH. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: DID YOU GET TO EXPERIENCE THE SUBMARINE AT ALL? DID YOU GET TO GO --
I GOT INVITED BY THE ROYAL NAVY TO GO DOWN FOR FOUR OR FIVE DAYS ON AN OPERATION OFF GIBRALTAR. IT WAS AMAZING.
Jimmy: A REAL SUBMARINE?
I GET ON A LITTLE JIB, THIS SPEED BOAT. AND WE RIDE OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA. AND THERE'S NOTHING. I'M GOING, "ARE YOU SURE WE'RE HERE? ARE YOU SURE IT'S HERE?"
AND THEY WERE GOING, "YES, SIR. NOT THAT WAY. I'M GOING THIS DIRECTION." SUDDENLY OUT OF THE SEA, COMES THIS THING THE SIZE OF AN OFFICE BLOCK. COMES OUT OF THE SEA. AND THEN I'M GOING LIKE, "WELL, HOW DO I GET ON?" BECAUSE HE'S NOT STOPPING. IT'S MOVING ALONG. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY GO, "YOU'LL NOTICE THESE RUBBER TILES ON THE SIDE. WE RUN UP THE SIDE OF THAT. WE'LL STICK FOR A MINUTE AND YOU GOT TO JUMP."
Jimmy: WHAT? LIKE I'VE SEEN THIS IN LIKE "SPONGEBOB" CARTOON, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M NOT PATRICK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, HELLO.
SO IT PULLS UP TO THE SIDE. I JUMP OFF, AND THIS HAND KIND OF GRABS YOU. AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU'RE GOING DOWN AND THEY CLOSE IT, AND THAT'S IT. YOU'RE IN FOR FOUR OR FIVE DAYS. I WAS JUST HOPING THEY DIDN'T GET CALLED OUT TO ACTUAL SERVICE. AND I GOT, YOU KNOW --

[ LAUGHTER ] AGAIN, IT WAS GOOD STAND UP COMEDY THERE. AND NO ONE SHOWED UP. NO, I WENT THERE JUST TO VISIT AND CHECK IT OUT. BECAUSE MY WIFE'S GRANDFATHER ACTUALLY WAS IN WORLD WAR II.
ON IT?
Jimmy: YEAH, ON IT IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC. AND BOY, IT'S A TINY THING.
IT WAS SURPRISINGLY SMALL.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. I ALMOST WENT CRAZY, LIKE JUST LOOKING AT IT AS YOU GO ON TOUR.
THE AMAZING THING IS THE CLAUSTROPHOBIA IS I FOUND NOT SO MUCH -- YOU KNOW, THE CONFINED SPACE, BUT MORE ALSO JUST THAT YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FROM PEOPLE, BECAUSE THE THING'S RUNNING 24/7. SO THERE'S ALWAYS PEOPLE AROUND, AND EVEN WHEN YOU SLEEP, IN THE DARK QUARTERS WHERE YOU GO TO SLEEP -- YOU LIE IN -- THE BUNKS ARE CALLED COFFINS. YOU LIE DOWN AND THE CEILINGS --
Jimmy: RIGHT THERE, YEAH.
SO YOU GOT TO ROLL IN AND ROLL OUT. CLAUSTROPHOBIA IS MORE THE PROXIMITY OF THESE PEOPLE.
Jimmy: IT JUST CAN'T SMELL GREAT.
THAT'S THE KEY. YOU GET IN, YOU GO, "OOH, THAT'S UNIQUE. WHAT IS THAT?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU NEED TO GET THE GREAT COLOGNE.
MAN MIXED WITH LIKE VEGETABLES, BECAUSE, OF COURSE, THERE'S VEGETABLES EVERYWHERE.
THE FOOD.
Jimmy: OIL AND --
THE SKIPPER ON MINE SAID, WITH GREAT PRIDE -- "MR. LAW," HE SAID, "WHEN YOU LEAVE THIS VESSEL, YOU WILL STINK LIKE A BADGER." [ LAUGHTER ] I KIND OF THOUGHT, YEAH, YEAH. HE WAS RIGHT. YOU GET OFF AND YOU'VE GOT TO BURN THE CLOTHES YOU'RE IN.
Jimmy: YOU JUST RANK.
Jimmy: YOU'LL ENJOY THIS MOVIE, IF YOU LIKE THOSE CAPERS AND EVERYTHING. LIKE I SAID YOU JUST END UP -- YOU'RE ON A SUBMARINE. YOU PICK THE BEST OF THE BEST. YOU NEED THE RUSSIANS TO GET THE SUB.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S HALF RUSSIANS. HALF THE ACTORS ARE RUSSIAN. THEN, YOU GOT AN AUSTRALIAN. YOU GOT AN AMERICAN, A BUNCH OF BRITS. AND THEY'RE QUITE DESPERATE BUNCH. THEY'RE DESPERATE MEN. SOME OF THEM ARE EX-CONS. THEY'VE ALL KIND OF LOST THEIR WAY, WHETHER IT'S IN THE ROYAL NAVY OR IN THE RUSSIAN NAVY. AND I DECIDE THAT WE CAN GO AND FIND THIS GOLD. AND IT WILL PUT US ON THE MAP, THAT IT WILL MAKE US ALL GREAT MEN. AND WE'LL FIND OUR DIGNITY AND RESPECT AGAIN.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S, YOU KNOW, MILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND THEN, THE ONE THING YOU SLIP AND SAY IS, WE'RE ALL GOING TO SPLIT THIS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THEN, THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER, LIKE, "OKAY, SO IF ONE DUDE DIES, WE GET MORE." THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THEY GET NASTY ON A SUBMARINE, MAN. THAT'S AWESOME. IT'S SO FUN. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S JUDE LAW IN THE SUBMARINE THRILLER "BLACK SEA". IN THEATERS FRIDAY, CHECK IT OUT. [ GUNFIRE ]

IT'S SO GOOD. I CAN LAY THERE LIKE A STONED TEENAGER FOR SIX HOURS.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD.
LITERALLY LIKE, EHH. SO GOOD.
Jimmy: NEW SEASON OF "THE AMERICANS". MORE INTENSE. WHAT IS HAPPENING THIS SEASON?
WHAT'S HAPPENING? MORE AND MORE FIGHTS. MORE INTRIGUE. WELL, BASICALLY, THIS SEASON IS -- THE MAIN THING CENTERS AROUND OUR DAUGHTER, PAIGE. AND IT'S ABOUT PHILLIP AND ELIZABETH.
Jimmy: BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE KGB AND NO ONE KNOWS IT.
OH YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU'RE POSING AS AMERICANS.
YES, WE'RE KGB SPIES LIVING DEEP COVER. AND NOW, THE CENTER, THE KGB, MIGHT WANT TO RECRUIT, OR THEY DO WANT TO RECRUIT, OUR DAUGHTER. AND WE DISAGREE ON IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT YOU ARE SUPER GREAT ON THIS SHOW, AND YOU BEAT PEOPLE UP.
ALL THE TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU REALLY DO. YEAH. AND THIS ONE -- THIS HERE, YOU FIGHT A GUY WHO IS A TV LEGEND.
YEAH. DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHO RICHARD THOMAS IS?
Jimmy: YEAH. [ CHEERS ] YOU MEAN, YOU MEAN "THE WALTONS" RICHARD THOMAS?
YEAH.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. JOHN-BOY FROM "THE WALTONS".
SO BASICALLY, THE FIRST -- ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS IN THIS NEW SEASON, I HAVE THIS BIG FIGHT SCENE. AND HE SHOWS UP AS A MEMBER OF THE FBI. AND I HAVE TO KIND OF BEAT HIM UP. AND OUR CAMERA BOYS WERE LIKE, "YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE GUN AND POINT IT AT HIM AND SAY, 'GOOD NIGHT, JOHN-BOY'." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: JUST FOR ONE TAKE, YOU GOT TO DO IT. "GOOD NIGHT, JOHN-BOY." [ IMITATES GUN FIRE ] YEAH. WHAT TYPE OF TRAINING DO YOU DO FOR THAT SHOW? DO YOU JUST LIKE -- BECAUSE I ALWAYS THINK THESE ARE CHOREOGRAPHED FIGHT SCENES. THESE ARE REALLY YOU. I CANT TELL. IN SOME OF THE SCENES, YEAH.
WE DO A LOT OF KRAV MAGA TRAINING. DO YOU KNOW KRAV MAGA?
Jimmy: NO. ARE YOU MAKING IT UP? [ LAUGHTER ]
WE DO KRAV MAGA, WHICH IS KIND OF THE CLOSEST THING -- WELL, IT'S WHAT THE RUSSIANS WERE TRAINED IN DOING. AND I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS GIRL, AVI, WHO TEACHES IT. SHE'S SO FEMME FATALE.
Jimmy: IS IT LIKE FLIPPING? IS IT LIKE JUDO?
IT'S KIND OF LIKE FIGHTING TO THE DEATH. IT'S SORT OF LIKE --
Jimmy: THAT SOUNDS LIKE CROSSFIT OR SOMETHING. SIMILAR TO IT, YEAH.
VERY SIMILAR TO THAT. SHE'S JUST THIS AMAZING, ATHLETIC TEACHER. AND IN FACT, I LOVED IT SO MUCH, THAT FOR MY 7-YEAR-OLD'S BIRTHDAY PARTY, I TOOK HIM AND A BUNCH OF 7-YEAR-OLDS AND HAD HER DO THIS FAKE MOCK TRAINING, SPY TRAINING FOR THEM.
Jimmy: 7-YEAR-OLDS DOING KRAV MAGA?
YEAH. LITERALLY, THEY WALKED IN. SHE HAD THIS WHOLE THING SET UP FOR THEM. AND SHE WAS LIKE, "EVERYONE SIT DOWN. YOU ARE ALL HERE BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A A SPY. AND WE'RE GOING TO TEST IT RIGHT NOW." THEY WERE LIKE --
Jimmy: NOW FIGHT TO THE DEATH! WAIT A SECOND! WHAT'S GOING ON?
AH, LET'S GO!
Jimmy: BUT IF IT WERE ANY DIFFERENT, IT WAS A A QUICK DRAW McGRAW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DOESN'T MATTER. DOESN'T MATTER. THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE. HOW ARE YOUR KIDS BY THE WAY?
THEY'RE WILD.
Jimmy: THEY ARE THE CUTEST KIDS. RIVER, LAST YEAR WE TALKED ABOUT HIS CHRISTMAS LIST. IT WAS THE CUTEST CHRISTMAS LIST BECAUSE HE WROTE -- YEAH.
I SAVE THEM EVERY YEAR. AND I MAKE HIM WRITE IT USUALLY IN HIS OWN HANDWRITING. I LOVE IT.
Jimmy: THIS IS HIS CHRISTMAS LIST THIS YEAR. I LOVE HE STARTED WITH ZERO.
ZERO.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T START YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST -- YOU CAN'T START YOUR LIST WITH ZERO. THAT'S SUPER CUTE, BUT --

Jimmy: THE GOOD THING IS, YOU TELL HIM, "HEY, HONEY, WE DID GET YOU ZERO iPODS."
RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: JUST WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.
JUST WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.
Jimmy: EXACTLY, YEAH. IT'S SUPER CUTE. BUT, HE WANTED VIDEO GAMES THERE. I LOVE NUMBER THREE. HE WANTED A NARF GUN. YOU CAN TELL HIM THAT DOESN'T EXIST. YEAH, HE'S NOT GETTING THAT. A BEAN BAG. I MEAN, HOW CUTE. DO YOU HAVE -- THEY LOVE THOSE NERF GUNS.

Jimmy: THAT'S THE CUTEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVED ABOUT HIS CHRISTMAS LIST -- THIS IS LAST YEAR'S CHRISTMAS LIST. HE BROUGHT THIS ON. LET'S START WITH NUMBER ONE. CAN WE ZOOM THE CAMERA DOWN? I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN DO THAT? TRAMPOLINE, BOUNCY HOUSE, A FAT SUIT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT MADE ME LAUGH. I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD. I HAVE TO ASK YOU, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHY WOULD HE WANT A FAT SUIT? AND WHAT IS THAT?
ISN'T THAT AMAZING? HIM AND HE HAS THESE TWO BEST FRIENDS, FRED AND CHARLIE, AND THEY ALL WANTED IT. AND THEY GOT IT.
Jimmy: AND THEY GOT IT. AND HERE'S THE KIDS ON CHRISTMAS. [ LAUGHTER ] KERI, IT'S THE CUTEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. I WANT THESE SO BAD.
