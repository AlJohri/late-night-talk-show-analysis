Questlove: 482!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT FEELS GOOD! I FEEL THE LOVE! I FEEL THE LOVE! PLEASE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIT DOWN, ENJOY YOURSELVES. HOT CROWD! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. WOO, I MISSED YOU GUYS, YEAH. WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. WE'RE SO HAPPY TO BE BACK ON THE AIR AFTER THE HIATUS. OR AS THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS CALL IT, A PLAYOFF GAME. WE'RE HAPPY WE'RE BACK. DID YOU SEE THIS LAST NIGHT, THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS BEAT THE CAVALIERS BY 33 POINTS IN GAME TWO OF THE NBA FINALS. 33 POINTS. EVEN PEOPLE SWITCHING OVER FROM "GAME OF THRONES" ARE LIKE, THIS IS BRUTAL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DID NOT SEE THIS COMING AT ALL. THE OTHER BIG SPORTS STORY IS THAT GAME FOUR OF THE STANLEY CUP FINALS WAS TONIGHT ON NBC. IT WAS THE PITTSBURGH PENGUINS VERSUS SAN JOSE SHARKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT SINCE IT WAS ON NBC, THEY STILL CALLED IT CHICAGO STANLEY CUP.
Steve: IT WORKS.
Jimmy: I SAW THAT BEFORE TONIGHT'S GAME, MEMBERS OF METALLICA PERFORMED "THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER." YEAH. HOCKEY AND METALLICA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EVEN DONALD TRUMP WAS LIKE, THAT'S TOO WHITE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO WHITE. IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN AN EXCITING SERIES. BUT I NOTICED THE ANNOUNCER FOR THE PITTSBURGH PENGUINS SOUNDED A LITTLE FAMILIAR.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, THIS IS THE ANNOUNCER FOR THE PENGUINS. TAKE A LISTEN. [ MORGAN FREEMAN'S VOICE ]
LOOK AT THIS FAMILY OF PENGUINS.
Jimmy: SEE WHAT I MEAN? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
CLIMBING MAJESTICALLY ACROSS THE ICE.
Jimmy: SOUNDS FAMILIAR TO ME.
THEY BETTER SCORE SOON.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
OR MORGAN IS GOING TO OWE HIS BOOKIE A LOT OF MONEY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HIS BOOKIE?
Steve: SOUNDS LIKE MORGAN FREEMAN.
Jimmy: THE WHOLE THING IS WRONG. MEANWHILE, WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO THE SUMMER OLYMPICS IN RIO. AND THIS IS PRETTY AMAZING. I READ THAT IDENTICAL TRIPLETS FROM ESTONIA WILL ALL RUN THE WOMEN'S MARATHON. YEAH. WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION, WHY WOULDN'T THEY JUST SPREAD OUT ALONG THE ROUTE AND PRETEND THEY'RE ONE PERSON? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: HE LOOKS FRESH. HE'S BEEN GONE FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS.
Steve: HE'S NOT EVEN SWEATING.
Jimmy: HE'S NOT EVEN SWEATING AT ALL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LET'S CHECK IN ON THE ELECTION, HERE. BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGNED IN CALIFORNIA YESTERDAY AHEAD OF THE STATE'S DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, AND EVEN CHECKED OUT THE FAMOUS CAROUSEL AT THE SANTA MONICA PIER. IT GOT A LITTLE AWKWARD WHEN THE MUSIC STOPPED AND BERNIE STILL WOULDN'T ADMIT THAT THE RIDE WAS OVER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS GOING TO BE A CONTESTED CAROUSEL! [ LAUGHTER ] JUST GET OFF. YESTERDAY WAS THE PRIMARY IN PUERTO RICO. AND I READ THAT SOME LINES TO VOTE WERE OVER TWO HOURS LONG. MANY PEOPLE JUST DECIDED TO LEAVE. YEAH, I THINK THE FOUNDING FATHERS PUT IT BEST WHEN THEY SAID, "GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH, BUT BUT I AIN'T WAITING FOR TWO HOURS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. AFTER WEEKS OF HESITATION, HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN FINALLY ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT ON THURSDAY. WHEN ASKED WHAT INFLUENCED HIS DECISION, RYAN SAID XANAX. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LOTS OF XANAX. TRUMP CREATED EVEN MORE CONTROVERSY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TRUMP CREATED EVEN MORE CONTROVERSY RECENTLY BY CLAIMING THE JUDGE PRESIDING OVER HIS TRUMP UNIVERSITY LAWSUIT IS BIASED, AND SAID HE SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE OF HIS MEXICAN HERITAGE. WHEN ASKED IF HIS ATTACKS WOULD HURT HIS STANDING WITH HISPANIC VOTERS, TRUMP WAS LIKE, GOOD POINT, HISPANICS SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM VOTING, TOO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY SHOULDN'T VOTE, THEY DON'T LIKE ME EITHER. THAT'S RIGHT, TRUMP CLAIMS THAT A JUDGE OF MEXICAN DESCENT IS BIASED AGAINST HIM. AND HE EVEN WENT ON TO SAY A A MUSLIM WOULD TREAT HIM UNFAIRLY AS WELL. TRUMP SAID THE ONLY FAIR WAY TO JUDGE ANYONE IS TO HOLD A A SWIMSUIT CONTEST. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THERE YOU GO. EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THIS. DONALD TRUMP WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS SUPPORTERS AT A RALLY IN CALIFORNIA ON FRIDAY, AND HE PICKED SOMEONE OUT OF THE AUDIENCE. JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID.
WE HAD A CASE WHERE WE HAD AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUY WHO IS A FAN OF MINE. GREAT FAN. GREAT GUY. IN FACT, I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M -- LOOK AT MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN OVER HERE, LOOK AT HIM.
Jimmy: ANYWAY, GLAD YOU'RE HERE. TELL ALL THE OTHER AFRICAN-AMERICANS I SAID HELLO. ALL RIGHT, WILL YOU PLEASE? [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. WE ACTUALLY HAVE FOOTAGE OF TRUMP'S STAFF WHEN THEY FOUND OUT HE HAS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPPORTER.
WE GOT ONE! [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS PRETTY COOL. DID YOU SEE THIS TODAY? THIS IS VERY EXCITING. GOOGLE'S NEW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROJECT, MAGENTA, JUST RELEASED ITS FIRST EVER SONG CREATED ENTIRELY BY A A COMPUTER. SO, NO HUMANS WERE INVOLVED IN MAKING THIS SONG. IT'S ALL A.I. THIS IS REAL.

Steve: SOUNDS LIKE IT HAS SOME KINKS TO WORK OUT.
Jimmy: THEY SHOULDN'T REALLY -- ACTUALLY, A NEW POLL DONE IN THE UK FINDS THAT WOMEN SPEND 17 MINUTES A DAY DEBATING WHAT OUTFIT TO WEAR, WHILE MEN SPEND 13 MINUTES. AND 12 OF THOSE MINUTES ARE SPENT ON THE SNIFF TEST TO DECIDE IF THAT OUTFIT IS CLEAN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LISTEN TO THIS, THERE'S A NEW APP AIMED AT BUSINESSMEN CALLED RECHARGE, WHICH LETS YOU RENT HOTEL ROOMS BY THE HOUR TO TAKE A NAP OR A SHOWER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND ALSO THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT WHAT IT'S REALLY FOR. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, YOU GUYS. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: THE YOUNGER MICHAEL CAINE.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: I'LL BLOW THE BLOODY DOORS OFF.
BUT HE -- I DID NEED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU -- I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE DOING IT WITH, BUT AT ONE POINT YOU WERE ON YOUR SHOW DOING A MICHAEL CAINE IMPRESSION, AND HE WAS WATCHING THAT NIGHT. AND, LIKE, IN HIS TRAILER, I GUESS HE HAD IT ONLINE OR SOMETHING BUT HE WAS LIKE, HE CAME OUT OF THE TRAILER AND REVIEWED YOUR IMPRESSION VERY POSITIVELY.
Jimmy: WHAT DID HE THINK?
HE SAID IT WAS GOOD. IT'S SO HARD TO DO IT WITHOUT DOING MICHAEL CAIN VOICE. BUT NOW HAVING WORKED WITH HIM I DON'T FEEL LIKE I CAN IMPERSONATE HIM ANYMORE. I FEEL LIKE IT'S -- YOU CAN.
Jimmy: YEAH, OH, YEAH. IT'S MY JOB, YEAH, YEAH.

AND A LOT OF ACTORS ARE REALLY JADED AND SORT OF MOAN ALL THE TIME, AND MICHAEL JUST LOVED IT. LIKE, HE STILL HAS JOY WHEN IT COMES TO -- LIKE THE ONLY TIME I SAW HIM EVEN GET REMOTELY IRATE WAS WHEN SOMEBODY -- A A CRANE CAMERA, LIKE ONE OF THEM SMACKED HIM IN THE HEAD, WHICH IS FAIR ENOUGH.
Jimmy: WHICH IS FAIR ENOUGH. WHO WOULD HIT MICHAEL CAINE WITH THE CAMERA? HELLO, LEARN YOUR LESSON.
YEAH. I DON'T THINK THAT GRIP FELT SUPER GOOD AFTER THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU DO AN ACTING SCENE WITH HIM UP CLOSE AND LOOKING IN HIS EYES, AND IT'S JUST LIKE A A PINCH ME MOMENT.
IT'S TOTALLY A PINCH ME -- AS SOMEBODY WHO GREW UP IN ENGLAND, HE IS SORT OF THE ARCHETYPE OF WHAT YOU WANT TO BE AS A BRITISH FILM ACTOR. JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU WANT YOUR CAREER TO BE AND EVERYTHING, SO. YEAH, I WANT TO BE HIM WHEN I GROW UP.
Jimmy: ME TOO. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP OF DANIEL RADCLIFFE IN "NOW YOU SEE ME 2." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
