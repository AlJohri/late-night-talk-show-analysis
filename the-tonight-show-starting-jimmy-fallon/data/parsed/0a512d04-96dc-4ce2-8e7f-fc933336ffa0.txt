[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT IN LIFE WHEN YOU CAN AFFORD TO NAP LIKE THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. OR MAYBE THERE IS SOME DEPRESSION. [ LAUGHTER ] I LIKE IT. I HAD A BLACKOUT NAP THE OTHER DAY. I WOKE UP, FELT PRETTY GOOD. I LOOKED AROUND AND THEN I THOUGHT, MY HOUSE IS BEAUTIFUL. AND THEN I REALIZED I HAD FALLEN ASLEEP IN IKEA. [ LAUGHTER ] IN THEIR EXAMPLE BED IN THEIR FAKE ROOM. [ LAUGHTER ] I REALLY DIDN'T GET IT. I JUST WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND TRIED TO GET A SNACK. NO SNACKS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT REALLY DIDN'T SINK IN UNTIL I WAS FOLLOWING ALL THE YELLOW ARROWS ON THE FLOOR TO A A ROW OF BATHROOMS. NONE OF THEM WERE REAL. [ LAUGHTER ] I KIND OF FREAKED OUT. I WAS LIKE, WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME? I'M AN INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTAR. I NEED TO RELIEVE MYSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] MY HUSBAND HAD TO CALM ME DOWN. HE TOOK ME TO GET SOME MEATBALLS. I AM MARRIED. I DON'T KNOW HOW I COBBLED THAT TOGETHER. I'M PRETTY PROUD OF MYSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] THANKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DIDN'T NEED TO APPLAUSE. IT'S A PRETTY NORMAL THING THAT PEOPLE DO. I'M PROUD OF MYSELF MOSTLY BECAUSE MY HUSBAND WAS A TOTAL REBOUND. [ LAUGHTER ] I -- AND ALSO HE PICKED ME UP WHICH DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ME. DIDN'T HAPPEN -- I MEAN I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE BECAUSE I HAVE THIS PACKAGE AND EVERYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT GUYS DON'T PICK UP ON ME. I DON'T EVEN MAKE THE RIGHT FACES IN LIFE. I HAVE ONE OF THE FACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "HEY, WHY DON'T YOU SMILE?" AND I'M LIKE, "I AM SMILING." [ LAUGHTER ] SO WHEN HE PICKED ME UP, IT WAS ON, RIGHT? AND THREE MONTHS INTO DATING I WAS TOTALLY PREGNANT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW WHAT'S MORE SCARY THAN BEING PREGNANT? HAVING THE BABY. SO I TRIED TO HAVE A NATURAL BIRTH BUT MY SON'S HEAD WAS SO BIG. IT'S JUST A BIG OLD SKULL. HE'S A GENIUS. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN HE'S LIKE THE REAL DEAL. HE'S NOT GOING TO JUST PRETEND TO BE ONE ON TV LIKE HIS MOM. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HIS HEAD WAS SO BIG AND MY BODY WAS SO TINY. SO I HAD TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY C SECTION. AND WHEN YOU HAVE THAT, LIKE YOU'RE TOTALLY OUT OF IT, RIGHT? I'M ON DRUGS. SOMEONE ELSE IS HOLDING THE BABY. SO I HAD THIS DRAMATIC MOMENT OF REALIZATION. I WAS LIKE, "IS THAT THE BABY? THAT'S IT? OH, I DON'T LIKE IT." [ LAUGHTER ] I REALLY DON'T. IS THERE A RECEIPT OR SOMETHING? WHAT IS THE RETURN POLICY ON THIS? CAN HE HEAR ME? [ LAUGHTER ] OH, KEEP IT? YOU JUST KEEP IT. OKAY. WE KEPT HIM. HE'S 7-YEARS-OLD. THANK YOU. HE'S DOING GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE LIVE IN LOS ANGELES AND, OF COURSE, WE HAVE NO WINTER THERE. SO THE OTHER DAY HE PUSHED ME IN THE POOL. YEAH. I WENT RIGHT INSIDE. I GOT ON MY LAPTOP AND JUST WIPED OUT HIS 529 COLLEGE SAVINGS PLAN. [ LAUGHTER ] IT COST ME 10% TO GET THE MONEY OUT. BUT I WAS SO COLD AND WET AND ANGRY THAT I DIDN'T GIVE A A DAMN. I WENT RIGHT TO THE FIRST, MOST EXPENSIVE SITE I COULD THINK OF WHICH WAS MERCEDES.COM AND I JUST BOUGHT A TRAVEL MUG. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT? THAT'S ALL THE MONEY I HAD IN HIS SAVINGS ACCOUNT. YOU GUYS ARE LOOKING AT ME LIKE, MARY LYNN, YOU'RE A HUGE TV STAR. DIDN'T YOU MACH A LOT OF MONEY? YEAH, I DID. AND I SPENT THAT MONEY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO DO. IT'S MONEY. SO THEN I SEE MY SON, HE'S COWERING IN THE CORNER. I GO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HE GOES, ARE YOU GOING TRY TO PUSH ME IN THE POOL? I WAS LIKE, NO, YOU'LL GET IT. [ LAUGHTER ] LATER. WHEN YOU TRY TO GO TO COLLEGE. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T TOUCH MOMMY'S COFFEE MUG. THAT'S SPECIAL. THANKS A LOT YOU GUYS. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
