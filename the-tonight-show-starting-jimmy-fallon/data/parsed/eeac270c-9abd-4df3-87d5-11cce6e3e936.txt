NO, WHEN I STARTED OUT, I SURE DIDN'T. BUT YOU KNOW -- HAS IT'S UPS AND DOWNS. YOU SELL A LOT OF ALBUMS ONE WEEK AND NOT THE NEXT. SO YOU JUST GOT TO KEEP PILING THROUGH.

YEAH, I WAS. I REMEMBER WE HAD SINGING LESSONS AT SCHOOL. AND THE SINGING TEACHER USED TO PICK ON ME. SAY, "STEWART? OY, COME OVER HERE. I WANT YOU TO SING ON YOUR OWN." AND IT GOT SO BAD, I WOULD BE OFF SCHOOL. LIKE I WAS SICK. I WAS PARANOID ABOUT HAVING TO SING IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND NOW LOOK AT YOU. YOU SING IN FRONT OF STADIUMS.
STILL BLOODY NERVOUS.
Jimmy: NO YOU'RE NOT. NO. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS IS CALLED "ANOTHER COUNTRY" AND I THINK THE TRICKY PART OF THE TITLE IS THAT YOU NEVER MADE A COUNTRY ALBUM. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS ONE ISN'T COUNTRY AT ALL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO THAT'S THE FUN OF IT. NEITHER -- IT NEITHER IS ANOTHER COUNTRY ALBUM, NOR IS IT COUNTRY MUSIC. BUT IT'S ANOTHER COUNTRY RECORD FROM ROD STEWART.

NO, NO. THERE'S A LOVELY -- HAVE YOU GOT CHILDREN?
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE.

Jimmy: AW. WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER GOING ON TOUR WITH ELTON JOHN?
