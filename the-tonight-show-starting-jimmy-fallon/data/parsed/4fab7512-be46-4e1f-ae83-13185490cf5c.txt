GUYS, WE HAVE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OR DANNY DEVITO. IT'S STILL PRETTY HARD TO TELL THEM APART. ONE OF THEM HERE TONIGHT. VERY EXCITED. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. YESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP SAID IF HE'S ELECTED PRESIDENT HE WOULD RARELY LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE TO TAKE VACATIONS BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH WORK TO DO. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] DONALD TRUMP IS THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN SAY HE'S GOING TO SPEND FOUR YEARS IN A MANSION AND MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A SACRIFICE. I'M NOT EVER GOING TO LEAVE THIS TINY NON SKY-SCRAPER HOME. IN AN INTERVIEW THIS WEEK LINCOLN CHAFEE SAID THAT HE'S CONFIDENT HILLARY CLINTON WILL LOSE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION TO HIM, MARTIN O'MALLEY OR BERNIE SANDERS. AFTER WHICH THE REPORTER THANKED HIM AGAIN FOR TAKING THE TIME TO SPEAK WITH HIS HIGH SCHOOL NEWSPAPER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'VE GOT TO GO COVER OUR BAKE SALE. THEN I'VE GOT TO ASK SALLY TO THE PROM. I'M GOING TO ASK SALLY TO THE PROM. I HEARD YOU. I HEARD YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'LL GO WITH ME OR NOT. MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE INTERVIEWING PEOPLE. I LIKE TO ASK PEOPLE QUESTIONS. I'M A VERY INQUISITIVE BOY. LIKE SPEAKING OF QUESTIONS, I'M GOING TO ASK SALLY TO THE PROM. [ LAUGHTER ] LINCOLN CHAFEE ALSO SAID THAT HE REALLY LOVES THE OUTDOORS, AND CNN SAID, GOOD, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE PUTTING YOU FOR THE DEBATE. ONLY THE TOP TEN GET IN. YOU GET A PODIUM IN THE PARKING LOT. ACCORDING TO A NEW POLL, A A GENERIC DEMOCRAT -- A GENERIC DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WOULD BEAT A GENERIC REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN THE 2016 ELECTION. NO ONE IS HAPPIER TO HEAR THAT THAN GENERIC DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE MARTIN O'MALLEY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DOESN'T HE LOOK LIKE THE PRESIDENT? LET'S SHOW HIM AGAIN. DOESN'T HE LOOK LIKE THE PRESIDENT BEING WHISKED TO SAFETY IN EVERY ACTION MOVIE? RIGHT THIS WAY, MR. PRESIDENT. THIS ISN'T GOOD. ACCORDING TO A NEW POLL, CHRIS CHRISTIE'S APPROVAL RATING AS GOVERNOR HAS HIT A A NEW LOW AFTER IT JUST DROPPED TO 30%. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] IN FACT, HIS POPULARITY IS SO LOW, HE'S THE ONLY GUY IN NEW JERSEY WHO DOESN'T KNOW A A GUY. I MEAN, I KNOW A GUY WHO KNOWS A GUY, BUT THIS GUY DOESN'T KNOW ANY GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I DON'T KNOW THIS GUY. ALL RIGHT. KIDDING ME OVER HERE? THIS IS FOR YOU. IT'S FOR YOU. DON'T TAKE ANYTHING. IT'S FOR YOU. DO KNOW THIS GUY? TARIQ, YOU KNOW THIS GUY?
Tariq: I DON'T KNOW THIS GUY, MAN. GET OVER HERE. GET OUT OF HERE.

Questlove: I DON'T KNOW THIS GUY MAN. I DON'T KNOW THIS GUY. [ LAUGHTER ]

Questlove: DE NIRO. DE NIRO. SORRY, SORRY.
Jimmy: IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A A STALLONE TYPE OF THING. BUT, I LIKED IT. IT WAS GOOD. IT'S BETTER THAN YOUR DE NIRO. YOUR DE NIRO IS STILL HANDS DOWN -- YOU AND TINA FEY HAVE THE WORST DE NIRO IMPRESSIONS I'VE EVER SEEN.
Questlove: I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
Jimmy: YOU DO ROBERT DE NIRO, YOU GO, A A LITTLE BIT. THIS IS ME. OKAY, OKAY. NOW YOU DO IT. YOU DO IT.
Questlove: MY TURN. MY TURN.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. MEANWHILE, THERE ARE REPORTS THAT CHRIS CHRISTIE IS GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK. YEP, AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT OUR SHOW IS OFF NEXT WEEK FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY, SO I'D LIKE TO SAY TO CHRIS CHRISTIE, WELL PLAYED, MY FRIEND. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WELL PLAYED INDEED. OH, YOU GOT ME. SMART MAN. BUT THAT STORY'S NOT GOING AWAY. WE'LL STILL HIT IT BEFORE IT GETS TOO STALE, WHICH INCIDENTALLY IS WHAT CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID ABOUT HIS LEFTOVER BIRTHDAY CAKE. ♪♪ I'M KIDDING. I'M KIDDING. HE'D NEVER HAVE LEFTOVER BIRTHDAY CAKE. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OH, MAN, THIS WEEK GOOGLE UNVEILED A NEW FEATURE THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO UNSEND E-MAIL MESSAGES UP TO 30 SECONDS AFTER THEY'VE SENT. OR AS THAT'S ALSO KNOWN, STILL NOT LONG ENOUGH TO SOBER UP. YOU'RE THE WORST BOSS IN THE WHOLE WORLD, AND YOU HAVE A A FLAT BUTT. [ LAUGHTER ] I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE SENT THAT. 31 SECONDS, OH, FORGET IT. CAN I HAVE ANOTHER ONE OF THESE? I'M FIRED NOW. GIVES ME A REASON TO DRINK. THIS IS COOL. PRODUCERS OF THE NEW "INDEPENDENCE DAY" MOVIE RECENTLY GAVE FANS A SNEAK PEEK, WHICH INCLUDED A DEVICE CALLED THE "MOON TUG." [ LAUGHTER ] SOUNDS LESS LIKE ALIEN TECHNOLOGY AND MORE LIKE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER TOO MANY MONTHS IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. DON'T COME IN HERE! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GOT A MOON TUG GOING ON IN THERE. I'VE GOT TO USE THE BATHROOM, CARL, GET OUT OF THERE!
Steve: ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SOME BUSINESS NEWS HERE. YESTERDAY VERIZON OFFICIALLY BOUGHT AOL FOR OVER $4 BILLION. AOL IS REALLY HAPPY WITH THE DEAL. MAINLY BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED $4. OH, SURE, $4 BILLION?

Steve: WHAT DID I SAY?
Jimmy: AND FACEBOOK IS NOW OFFICIALLY WORTH MORE THAN WAL-MART AFTER ITS STOCK ROSE 3% YESTERDAY. WAL-MART AND FACEBOOK ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT IN COMMON. THEY'RE BOTH PLACES YOU CAN GO AND SEE HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS WHO GOT FAT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FINALLY, EVERYBODY, THIS IS CRAZY.

Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE THAT. I DO LIKE IT WHEN YOU ARE PROUD OF ME, BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU THIS STORY. WE HUNG OUT LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE. I ASKED YOU, BECAUSE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CIGARS. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CIGARS. YOU CALLED ME UP AND SAID, "JIMMY, WE'RE GOING TO THE HAVANA ROOM, I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME. YOU HAVE TO COME NOW." "QUICKLY, GET TO THE CHOPPER. COME ON, JIMMY." AND I GO, YES. AND I GO, BUT YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE GOING -- SORRY. HE SIGNED A CONTRACT. HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO HIT ME. SO, HE SIGNED A CONTRACT.

RIGHT.
Jimmy: SO YOU DID, YOU CALLED ME UP AND YOU INVITED ME. IT WAS VERY NICE OF YOU.

YOU CHECK THINGS OUT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
HOLD IT, AND THEN YOU, I GAVE YOU THE CIGAR, REALLY A A BIG, BEAUTIFUL CIGAR. IT WAS A CUBAN CIGAR. SO, THIS WAS LIKE A $100 CIGAR. YOU STARTED GOING -- YOU STARTED LICKING IT. I SAID, "WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?" "WHY ARE YOU LICKING THE CIGAR?"
Jimmy: I HEARD SOMEWHERE THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LICK THE CIGAR, BECAUSE IT MOISTENS UP THE CIGAR AND IT HAS A A SLOWER BURN -- I WAS TRYING TO IMPRESS YOU.
THERE'S TWO THINGS I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO. I SAID, "DON'T COUGH." BECAUSE THAT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE AN AMATEUR. AND THEN, DON'T LICK." LLL JUST TOUCH THE CIGAR, PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH, AND BE COOL.
Jimmy: I TRIED.
YOU WERE ALL OVER THE PLACE. COUGHING.
Jimmy: I CLEARED ALL THE SMOKE AWAY, AND YOU WERE GONE. YOU WERE ALREADY GONE.
I FELT LIKE I WAS A FAILURE IN MY TEACHING.

Jimmy: "AFTER SCHOOL ALL STARS."

NOW THIS -- YOU'VE TAKEN IT TO A NEW LEVEL. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE MOVIE? THERE'S SO MANY TWISTS AND TURNS IN THIS ONE. IN TEN WORDS OR LESS, CAN YOU SUM THIS MOVIE UP? THAT'S FOUR RIGHT THERE.
A MACHINE AND A QUALITY WOMAN AND SAVE THE WORLD.
Jimmy: OKAY, THAT'S GOOD. I'LL TAKE THAT, ABSOLUTELY. THE ONE THING I TOOK FROM THIS IS IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEVER HAS BEEN DONE IN CINEMA HISTORY. YOU FIGHT YOURSELF. YOU FIGHT A YOUNGER VERSION OF YOURSELF IN AN ACTION SCENE IN THIS MOVIE. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
WELL, IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS AVAILABLE NOW. BECAUSE THEY REALLY HAD TO RECREATE ME FROM THE 1984 "TERMINATOR" MOVIE, FROM THE FIRST "TERMINATOR" MOVIE, WHEN I MEET THESE PUNKS AND ASK THEM FOR THEIR CLOTHES. AND SO FROM THAT POINT ON, HE ALL OF A SUDDEN HEARS A VOICE BEHIND HIM SAYING, YOU WON'T NEED THE CLOTHES. AND SO HE TURNS AROUND AND SEES THE OTHER TERMINATOR, WHICH IS THE SAME MODEL AS ME, THE T-800. SO, NOW WE ARE TWO. HE IS TRYING TO DESTROY THE HUMAN RACE, AND I AM THERE TO SAVE THE HUMAN RACE. THAT LEADS TO THIS GIGANTIC BATTLE.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HAPPY SUMMER, EVERYBODY! I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE. HERE IS ONE OF THE MANY AWESOME ACTION SCENES IN THE NEW MOVIE "TERMINATOR: GENISYS" IN THEATERS NEXT WEDNESDAY. CHECK THIS OUT.

Jimmy: THE PRESIDENT SAID POO.
AND WHEN HE SAID POO, I THOUGHT, "THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE. IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS." I CAN DIE RIGHT NOW. IF I MADE A FALSE MOVE AND THE SECRET SERVICE SHOT ME IN THE HEAD, THOSE THREE SECONDS WHERE I'M GOING DOWN, I WOULD THINK, MY LIFE'S BEEN PRETTY GOOD. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THE PRESIDENT SAID POO. WE'RE ALL JUST PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT?
Jimmy: YES.
YOU'D BE THRILLED!
Jimmy: YES, I'D BE --
HE GOES, "THE POO DOESN'T SMELL RIGHT AWAY. IT DOESN'T SMELL LIKE ADULT POO." AND HE LOOKED AT ME FOR AFFIRMATION. HE GOES -- [ LAUGHTER ] "ADULT POO SMELLS BAD." I SAID, "ABSOLUTELY, MR. PRESIDENT." ADULT POO SMELLS TERRIBLE. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO THE POO SUMMIT 2015. [ LAUGHTER ] HE GOES, "THE POO DOESN'T SMELL LIKE ADULT POO." HE GOES, "ALSO, WHEN YOU BRING THEM HOME, THEY'RE GOING TO SLEEP A LOT. DON'T FREAK OUT." HE'S A VERY CALM MAN, THE PRESIDENT. "THEY'RE GOING TO SLEEP A LOT. AND SOMETIMESTHE NURSING DOESN'T WORK RIGHT AWAY. IT'S A LITTLE BIT WONKY.
Jimmy: WONKY?
WONKY. LITTLE BIT WONKY. SO DON'T FREAK OUT. AND THEN HE GOES, AND "BABIES CRAVE STRUCTURE WHEN THEY'RE EATING AND SLEEPING." THEY CRAVE STRUCTURE. HE STOPS AND HE THINKS ABOUT IT, AN HE GOES, THAT'S ACTUALLY SOME PRETTY GOOD ADVICE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S RIGHT.
HE COMPLIMENTED HIS OWN ADVICE! AS THOUGH THIS MAN DOESN'T GET ENOUGH COMPLIMENTS IN HIS DAY. AND THEN MY WIFE SAID TO HIM WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE FUNNIEST THING YOU COULD EVER SAY TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SHE GOES, "IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE, TEXT US." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS. CONGRATULATIONS TO YOUR WIFE AND THAT BEAUTIFUL BABY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
