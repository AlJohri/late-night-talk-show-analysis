Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- MARK WAHLBERG, KEVIN NEALON, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 177!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. LOOKING GOOD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A CROWD RIGHT THERE. WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOT SHOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD SHOW, YOU GUYS. FIRST, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. I SAW THAT "TIME" MAGAZINE HAS NAMED EBOLA FIGHTERS THE 2014 PERSON OF THE YEAR. THE EBOLA FIGHTERS SAY THEY WERE HONORED TO BE CHOSEN AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE CEREMONY. THEN "TIME" SAID, "OH, NO. WE'LL JUST MAIL THEM TO YOU." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME. THIS IS INTERESTING HERE. YESTERDAY, FACEBOOK REVEALED THAT EBOLA WAS THE MOST POPULAR FACEBOOK TOPIC IN THE U.S. THIS YEAR. WITH THE WORLD CUP COMING IN SIXTH. SO, WELCOME TO AMERICA -- WHERE EVEN EBOLA IS MORE POPULAR THAN SOCCER. [ LAUGHTER ] WE JUST DON'T GET IT. WE DON'T GET SOCCER. [ APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, THE BIG NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON IS THIS REPORT ON CIA INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES. TODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS TALKING ABOUT THE REPORT AND PRAISED OUR COUNTRY'S ABILITY TO QUOTE "FACE OUR IMPERFECTIONS, MAKE CHANGES AND DO BETTER." SOUNDS LESS LIKE A SPEECH ON TORTURE AND MORE LIKE THE COMMENTS ON A KINDERGARTNER'S REPORT CARD. TIMMY PLAYS WELL WITH OTHERS, BUT NEEDS TO WATER BOARD LESS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOTHING BUT TROUBLE FOR OBAMA THESE DAYS. IN FACT ACCORDING TO A NEW POLL, 55% OF AMERICANS THINK REPUBLICANS FOCUS MORE ON PUSHING OBAMA'S BUONS THAN ACTUALLY PURSUING THEIR AGENDA. THEN REPUBLICANS SAID, "NOT TRUE. PUSHING HIS BUTTONS IS OUR AGENDA." SO, I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GO AT IT. THAT'S RIGHT. PEOPLE THINK REPUBLICANS FOCUS TOO MUCH ON PUSHING OBAMA'S BUTTON INCIDENTALLY, PUSHING OBAMA'S BUTTONS IS ALSO THE REASON WHY BIDEN ISN'T ALLOWED IN THE OVAL OFFICE ANYMORE. "WHAT'S THAT RED ONE DO?" "OH, THAT WAS MADAGASCAR." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS KIND OF COOL THOUGH ACTUALLY. I SAW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA RECENTLY SAT FOR A 3D PORTRAIT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IT WAS LIKE A GROUP OF LIKE THESE TECHNICIANS SET UP A A HIGHLY ADVANCED PHOTO CAPTURE DEVICE TO CREATE A FINELY DETAILED 3D IMAGE OF THE PRESIDENT. IT'S -- I'M NOT SURE IT CAME OUT THE WAY THEY PLANNED, BUT CHECK THIS OUT.
IN ABOUT ONE SECOND AS HE HOLDS HIS PRESIDENTIAL POSE, HE'LL BE ILLUMINATED BY 10 DIFFERENT LIGHTING CONDITIONS. WHICH WILL GIVE US EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SHAPE OF HIS FACE AND HOW IT TRANSFORMS INTO ILLUMINATION INTO THE IMAGES THAT WE SEE OF HIM. IT'S THE HIGHESTESOLUTION DIGITAL MODEL THAT'S EVER BEEN USED.
Jimmy: YEAH, I DON'T THINK. THAT'S NOT -- I MEAN, THAT'S JUST --
Steve: THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT QUITE THERE YET. TECHNOLOGY IS NOT QUITE THERE YET.
Steve: ALMOST.
Jimmy: VERY CLOSE.
Steve: ALMOST THERE.
Jimmy: VERY CLOSE TO HIM. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GUYS, SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS HERE. I READ THAT MANY REPUBLICANS THINK THAT THE FACT THAT CHRIS CHRISTIE IS STILL STANDING STRONG AFTER HIS BRIDGEGATE SCANDAL COULD MAKE HIM AN EVEN BETTER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN 2016. THAT'S NOT SURPRISING. I MEAN, EVERYONE KNOWS WEEBLES WOBBLE, BUT THEY DO NOT FALL DOWN.
Steve: NO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE'S GOING TO KILL ME. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DO IT ALL THE TIME. ONE DAY, HE'S JUST GOING TO PUNCH ME RIGHT IN THE FACE.
Steve: YEAH, RIGHT IN THE FACE. IT MIGHT BE A PRESIDENTIAL PUNCH. YOU NEVER KNOW.
Jimmy: I KNOW, YEAH. YEAHTHE PRESIDENT PUNCHED ME, YOU KNOW. DURING A RECENT INTERVIEW JEB BUSH'S BROTHER, NEAL SAID THAT THEIR MOTHER HACOME AROUND TO THE IDEA OF JEB RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016. SO, IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT SAYS YOU'RE QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT, IT'S YOUR OWN MOM GOING, "I GUESS YOU COULD DO IT. I GUESS?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DID YOU SEE THIS YET? A WOMAN ACTUALLY GAVE BIRTH IN THE MIDDLE OF A SOUTHWEST AIRLINES FGHT YESTERDAY. AND THE PILOTS HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING. AND APPARENTLY NO ONE SAW IT COMING. TAKE A LOOK. WATCH THIS.
WHO WAS SITTING NEAR THE PREGNANT WOMAN SAID THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED.
THAT'S WHEN I HEARD A BABY CRYING AND I'M LIKE, "THERE'S NO BABIES ON THIS FLIGHT."
AND A LADY STOOD UP AND SAID SHE JUST HAD A BABY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: KIDS, IF YOU LOOK TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AISLE, YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T UNSEE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WOW. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO? IN FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT.
Steve: SHOULD I PULL ON THAT CORD AND I GET OXYGEN? [ LAUGHT ]
Jimmy: RE'S SOME TV NEWS HERE. THE CONTESTS FOR THE NEXT SEASON OF "THE BACHELOR" WERE ANNOUNCED. AND SOME OF THEIR JOBS INCLUDE -- THIS IS REAL. SPORTS FISHING ENTHUSIAST AND CADAVER TISSUE SALESWOMAN. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] EVEN LINKEDIN WAS LIKE, "SORRY, THAT SOUNDS TOO MADE UP. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A REAL OCCUPATION." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS ISN'T GOOD HERE. I SAW SOME RESEARCHERS ARE CLAIMING THAT DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, THE POPULATION OF REINDEER IS RAPIDLY DECLINING. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] OF COURSE, THE PERSON THIS HURTS THE MOST IS SANTA. NOW, HE'S LIKE, "ON DASHER, ON DANCER, ON PRANCER AND UBER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOSE NOT SHINY ENOUGH. THREE OUT OF FIVE STARS. SORRY. SORRY NOT SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS. ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY, THE AMOUNT OF JOB OPENINGS IN THE U.S. HIT ITS HIGHEST RATE IN ALMOST 13 YEARS THIS OOBER. MOST COMMON -- MOST COMMON POSITION? SPORTS FISHING ENTHUSIAST AND CADAVER TISSUE SALESWOMAN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S A JOB.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: CADAVER TISSUE SALESWOMAN.
Steve: I USE MY SAMPLE KIT.

NO! [ CRYING ] YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHT ]
Jimmy: THAT IS SUCH A SHAME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN, THE OTHER TWO-YEAR-OLDS ARE LIKE, "DO YOU MIND IF WE PLAY THROUGH? THIS IS A LITTLE RIDICULOUS." [ LAHTER ] AND FINALLY, WITH THE HOLIDAYS COMING UP, WE'RE ALL TRYING TO EAT HEALTHIER. SO, YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS. CHEERIOS IS RELEASING A NEW ANCIENT GRAINS CEREAL NEXT YEAR. WHICH WI BE MADE WITH QUINOA, KAMUT, WHEAT AND SPELT. THE FIRST CEREAL WHERE THE PRIZE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX IS THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX. [ LAUGHTER ] THANKS GOD, IT'S OVER. THAT WAS EXHAUSTING.

WHEN YOU GET HOME, YOU KNOW, "WHAT DID YOU BRING ME? YOU DIDN'T BRING ME ANYTHING? OH, I HATE YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S A A GOOD NOTE. I DON'T WANT THAT. YEAH, NO. 11, THAT'S TOUGH. BUT DO, DO YOU EMBARRASS YOUR KIDS 'CAUSE THAT'S NORMALLY WHAT THEY DO. LIKE, "DAD!"
YEAH, I DON'T INTENTIONALLY EMBARRASS THEM BUT, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, LIKE, WHEN I TAKE MY KIDS TO SCHOOL, I WANT TO GIVE THEM A NICE HUG AND A KISS ON THE PLAYGROUND BEFORE THEY GO TO SCHOOL. EVEN MY FOUR -- LITERALLY MY FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOLTS. SHE'S GONE. I'M LIKE, "I LOVE YOU." EVERYBODY ELSE TURNS AROUND, LOOKS AT ME WEIRD. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I DON'T CARE, I'LL KEEP YELLING IT AND SCREAMING IT. I DEMAND A KISS FROM ALL OF THEM.

MY DAUGHTER, MY OLDEST DAUGHTER REALLY HAS THE BUG. SHE ACTUALLY, THEY DID AITTLE BIT PART IN "TRANSFORMERS." WHICH, YOU KNOW, IF YOU BLINK, YOU MISS 'EM. BUT I TOLD HER NO, NO MOVIES UNTIL SHE GRADUATES. I'M TRYING TO DISCOURAGE THEM FROM GOING INTO THIS BUSINESS. 'CAUSE YOU KNOW, IT'S A TOUGH RACKET. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. SHE'S BEEN DOING A LOT OF SCHOOL PLAYS AND SHE'S IN YATTA, SO SHE'S DONE ABOUT TEN MUSICALS.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH. SHE DOES.
Jimmy: DID YOU DO PLAYS GROWING UP?
I DID ONE. YOU TRYNA --
Jimmy: WHAT?
-- TEST MY ACTING CREDIBILITY?
Jimmy: NO, NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TRUST ME. I KNOW YOU'RE A LEGITIMATE ACTOR.
PEOPLE ALWAYS TELL ME ALL THE TIME THAT I'M NOT LIKE THIS CLASSICALLY TRAINED ACTOR.
Jimmy: OH, NO, NO, NO.
ROYAL SHAKESPEAREAN ACADEMY. BUT I DID -- I DID -- [ LAUGHTER ] I DID "WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY." I PLAYED AN OOMPA LOOMPA IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! I TRY TO GET DOWN TO THE REAL NITTY GRITTY. THAT'S WHAT WE WAND TO KNOW! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ABOUT THE OOMPA LOOMPA. WAIT. YOU WERE AN OOMPA LOOMPA?
I WAS AN OOMPA LOOMPA.
Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD!
IAD A MONOLOGUE, TOO. I DON'T REMEMBER IT. YOU WOULD THINK I'D REMEMBER IT THE WAY I OBSESS OVER LEARNING MY LINES. MY BIGGEST FEAR IS NOT BEING PREPARED.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT, NO. ALL I REMEMBER IS THE -- ♪ OOMPA LOOMPA DOO-PA-DEE-DOO ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAD THE SONG BUT I HAD ONE MONOLOGUE.  Jimmy: YOU HAD THE MAKEUP? WERE YOU LIKE ORGE AND --
NOT AT THAT -- IT WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN BOSTON. WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU BASICALLY YOU'RE WEARING YOUR BROTHER, UR BROTHER'S JACKET IF HE WAS STILL ASLEEP WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL. OR I'D TAKE HIS SNEAKERS THAT WERE THREE SIZES TOO BIG.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT. BUT NOW, LOOK HERE. YOU GO FROM OOMPA LOOMPA TO NOW DOING -- YOU'RE A BIG GIANT MOVIE STAR. "THE GAMBLER," COMES OUT, IS IT CHRISTMAS DAY?
CHRISTMAS D, WIDE, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU PRODUCED THIS ONE AS WELL. I MEAN, YOU DO, YOU DO A LOT OF STUFF.
YEAH AND I'M REMAKING ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE ACTOR'S MOVIES WHICH -- HE AND I ARE FRIENDS. JIMMY CAAN?
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHO STARRED IN THE ORIGINAL.
Jimmy: I WOULD BE AFRAID OF JAMES CAAN.
HE IS ONE OF THE FEW GUYS, LIKE, A LOT OF THESE GUYS WHO PLAY GANGSTERS IN MOVIES THEY'RE FROM LIKE, THE ROYAL SHAKESPEAREAN ACADEMY.
Jmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ALL LIKE, LEE STRASBERG SCHOOL OF ACTING. SO, THEY'RE NOT REALLY GANGSTERS BUT JIMMY CAAN IS A A GUY OM QUEENS. HE'S A REAL NEIGHBORHOOD GUY.
Jimmy: HE'S A WISE GUY.
I DON'T WANT TO SAY HE'S A A WISE GUY, BUT HE'S A REAL GUY. AND YOU KNOW, HE KINDA TOOK ME UNDER HIS WING THE FIRST TIME WE DID A MOVIE. SO, I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS REMAKE THIS MOVIE. AND HE SAID, "YEAH YOU KNOW, I GOT HIS BLESSING. MOVIE, I WANTED TO SHOW HIM THE MOVIE. HE CAME OVER TO MY HOUSE AND ODDLY ENOUGH, I HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM ON MY WALL RIGHT NEXT TO JIMMY CAGNEY. I HAVE ONE OF JOHN GARFIELD AND ONE OF STEVE MCQUEEN. AND HE SAID, "DID YOU JUST PUT THAT UP THERE BECAUSE I WAS COMING OVER?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND I SAID, "NO." BUT I WANTED TO MAKE IT SPECIAL FOR HIM. SO, HE CAME OVER AND I HAD DINNER AND OFFERED HIM A DRINK. AND I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DRINK?" AND I MADE SURE I HAD ALL THE STUFF BECAE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DRANK. AND HE SAYS, "I'LL HAVE A A VODKA." I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU WANT?" THEN HE GOES, "A [ BLEEP ] QUAIL SANDWICH. I JUST WANT VODKA." [ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS LIKE --
Jimmy: YOU'RE LIKE, OKAY, ALL RIGHT. IT'S JAMES CAAN. JUST GIVE IT TO HIM, MAN.
YEAH, THAT BROKE THE ICE.
Jimmy: DON'T MESS WITH THAT GUY.
HE HAD A COUPLE VODKAS AND WE SAW, I SHOWED HIM THE MOVIE AND HE ACTUALLY LOVED IT. YOU KNOW, WE TRIED TO MAKE OUR OWN VERSION OF THE MOVIE. IT'S INSPIRED BY THE ORIGINAL.
Jimmy: RIGHT, YEAH.
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW, THE ORIGINAL, IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE GAMBLING AND THE THRILL OF GAMBLING AND THE -- YOU KNOW, THUNKNOWN OF WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE OR NOT. AND FOR MY CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE, IT WASN'T ABOUT THAT. HE WAS JUST USING THAT AS A A TOOL TO STRIP HIMSELF OF ANYTHING MATERIAL-WISE SO HE COULD START OVER. IF HE WAS SUCCESSFUL AT GETTING AWAY FR GANGSTERS. AND WE GOT SOME AMAZING ACTORS IN
Jimmy: YE
WITH JOHN GOODMAN, MICHAEL KENNETH WILLIAMS
BRIE LARS
YEAH, BRIE LARSEN. FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: I LOVE HER, YEAH. DO Y KNOW MUCH ABO GAMBLING? ARE YOU A GAMBLER?
I'M NOT. I'M NOT.
Jimmy: ME NEITHER.
I MEAN, MY DAD WAS -- WAS NOT A GOOD GAMBLER. THE ONE THING HE DID, HE WON $1500 WHICH BOUGHT US A DOWN PAYMENT ON T ONE HOUSE THAT WE ACTUALLY OWNED FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT, , HE WAS NOT A GOOD GAMBLER. SO, THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD LESSON TO LEARN NOT TO GAMBLE.
BUT I DID GAMBLE IN PREPARING FOR THE MOVIE.
Jimmy: YEAH. WOULD YOU GO TO LIKE JUST CASINOS AND JUST --
YEAH, I WENT TO MACAU. I WENT TO THE MECCA OF GAMBLING WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM VEGAS AND ATLANTIC CITY. YOU KNOW IN VEGAS AND ATLANTIC CITY, THEY'RE GETTING EVERYBODY DRUNK SO THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU. IN MACAU, THESE ARE LIKE REALLY SERIOUS GAMBLERS. SO, I HAD A BUNCH OF FRIENDS THAT I WAS WITH, SOME WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN FROM HONG KONG AND I CONVINCED THEM TO GIVE ME ALL THE CASH THAT THEY HAD IN THEIR POCKETS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, WE'RE AT THE WYNN CASINO SITTING THERE WITH THE OWNER OF THE CASINIO. AND I --
Jimmy: THIS SOUNDS LIKE A A BAD IDEA ALREADY.
WE'RE PLAYING BLACKJACK. I GET AN ACE, I GET ANOTHER ACE, I SPLIT THE I GET A THIRD ACE AND THEN I PROCEED TO GET KING, QUEEN, JACK. I HAD A BLACKJACK THE TIMES. [ APPLAUSE ] NEEDLESS TO SAY, I WON A LOT OF MONEY. AND LIKE MY CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE, I TOOK EVERY CHIP OFF THE TABLE, WALKED RIGHT OVER TO THE ROULETTEHEEL, PUT IT ALL ON BLACK AND LOST EVERYTHING. [ LAHTER ] AND I WAS THRILLED. I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD. IT PLAYS OUT JUST LIKE THE MOVIE." AND THESE GUYS WERE LIKE, "WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?"
Jimmy: YOU LOST ALL OF OUR MONEY, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
$45,000 IN CASH.
Jimmy: I REMEMBER I WENT TO A CASINO WITH MY PARENTS. I BROUGHT THEM TO THIS CASINO. MY MOM, MY DAD AND I. I WOULD PUT THE COINS IN AND HE WOULD PULL THE LEVER. AND THEN WE WOULD SPLIT IF WE WON. WE PLAYED LIKE WHEEL OF FORTUNE. IT WAS ACTUALLY SLOT MACHINE AND WE WON LIKE -- I WANT TO SAY $200. AND WE FLIPPED OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE WERE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD." MY MOM WAS SLEEPING, SO WE WERE LIKE, "WAIT UNTIL SHE FINDS OUT WE WON $200! YOU'RE THE MAN! I LOVE YOU! ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU TOMORROW." THE COVER OF THE "NEW YORK POST" IS, "J. LO'S MOM PLAYS WHEEL OF FORTUNE SLOT MACHINE." WON LIKE $2 MILLION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE WERE FLIPPING OUT OVER $200, GOING CRAZY. I'M LIKE, "I'M NOT A GOOD GAMBLER AT ALL."
BUT WAS YOUR DAD ABLE TO WALK AWAY WITH THE WINNINGS OR DID YOU --
Jimmy: I FORCED HIM TO.
YOU WENT TO BED.
Jimmy: I FORCED HIM TO.
AND HE LOST EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: NO, NO. WE ENDED UP PROBABLY SPENDING IT ON SOMETHING ELSE, LIKE, PROBABLY BREAKFAST. I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GOOD GAMBLERS. THE FALLONS AREN'T GOOD, NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, AT LEAST HE WAS ABLE TO WALK AWAY. THAT'S THE TOUGH PART FOR MOST PEOPLE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN TO WALK AWAY.
Jimmy: IT'S CRAZY. Jimmy: BUT I MEAN, WHEN YOU GET TO THAT HIGH-STAKES GAMBLING, THAT'S --
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE --
I'VE SEEN SOME REALLY -- WHILE PREPARING FOR THE MOVIE, I SAW SOME REALLY HIGH-STAKE GAMES AND I LITERALLY SAW GUYS FLIPPING A COIN FOR $5 MILLION. BUT THESE ARE GUYS WHO GET TOGETHER AND THEY BASICALLY, THEY'RE ALL BILLIONAIRES AND THEY BASICALLY THEY'LL GIVE YOU $25 MILLION AND THE NEXT WEEK YOU'LL GIVE IT BACK. THEY JUST GO BACK AND FORTH.
Jimmy: HOLY MACKEREL.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO WITH IT.
Jimmy: I COULDN'T EVEN -- IT'S NOT FUN.
THERE'S MANY GOOD CAUSES THAT THEY COULD GIVE IT TO.
Jimmy: JUST HEARING THAT STUFF FREAKS ME OUT. OH, MY GOD. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE IN THE ROOM FOR THAT COIN-FLIP.
I WASN'T PLAYING THAT'S FOR SURE.
Jimmy: YEAH. WELL, YOU DO A GREAT JOB IN THIS MOVIE. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. HERE'S MARK WAHLBERG IN "THE GAMBLER." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
YOU KNOW WHO DOES RIDE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL? WHEN MOST OF US, AND EVEN I, EVEN I, WRITE BARELY ADEQUATELY. YOU KNOW WHO IT IS? DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. IT ISN'T THE ONE WHO TALKS THE MOST. YOU'RE AN NPR HOST TOPS, OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] THE LITERARYSON IN HERE IS MISS PHILLIPS. SHE IS BETTER AT WRITING THAN OUR U.S. PRESENTLY AMATEUR #2 IS AT TENNIS. YET, SHE CHOOSES TO HIDE O JUST BLEND IN WITH THE REST OF YOU. WHY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

I KNOW. I KNOW. BELIEVE ME, I KNOW. I GET IT. I GET IT. THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT A CROWD. WHAT A CROWD. WELL, I AM -- I GOT TO TELL YOU, I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE. I'VE HAD A GREAT WEEK. I JUST GOT AN ELECTRIC CAR. [ CHEERS ] SWEET. IT IS SWEET. IT'S IN THE SHOP NOW. WE'RE HAVING A GAS ENGINE PUT IN IT, BUT I LOVE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, IT IS THE BEST. IT'S SO UNIQUE, YOU KNOW? I JUST MISSED GASSING UP MY CAR. AND YOU KNOW, PETROLEUM NOW, GAS PRICES ARE COMING DOWN SO MUCH AND -- THEY'LL GO BACK UP AGAIN. IT'S ALL CONFUSING. AND I DON'T GET IT BECAUSE I WAS IN THE PHARMACY A COUPLE DAYS AGO. I SAW THAT PETROLEUM JELLY HAS NOT GONE UP ONE CENT. [ LAUGHTER ] TOO BAD OUR CARS CAN'T RUN ON PETROLEUM JELLY. THAT WOULD BE PRETTY COOL. IT WOULD BE HARD TO GET IT IN THERE, THOUGH. BUT YOU'LL GET IT IN THERE. [ LAUGHT ] YOU'LL WORK IT IN THERE. YOU'LL WORK IT IN. YOU DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? BUT I'M TELLING YOU THIS THING IS A BABE MAGNET. WHICH I DON'T NEED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR THE LAST 13 YEARS, BUT -- [ CHEERS ] I STILL LIKE TO LOOK, THOUGH, I'LL TELL YOU THAT. I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU. I GOT A WANDERING EYE. BUT LUCKILY, MY OTHER EYE IS A A LAZY EYE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, IT'S PUSH. THEY CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT. THE WANDERING EYE IS LIKE, "HEY BABY, WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK TO MY PLACE AND HAVE A LITTLE DRINK?" AND THEN THE LAZY EYE COMES AROUND, "OH, THIS LOOKS LIKE A A LOT OF WORK. LET'S JUST HAVE A COOKIE, HUH?" [ UGHTER ] SOMEBODY ASKED ME LAST WEEK WHAT MY BEST PICK-UP LINE WAS. AND YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAID, I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR THE LAST 13 YEARS. SO, MY BEST PICK-UP LINE IS, "HEY, ARE YOU AWAKE?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] RIGHT? ANYWAY, SO YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING ME ON TWTER OR ON AMBER ALERT? THOSE TWO THINGS RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MY TWITTER IS @KEVINNEALON AND MY AMBER ALERT IS A BLUE EL CAMINO WITH NEVADA LENSE PLATES. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, ANYWAY, THIS YEAR I'VE DECIDED I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE MORE RISKS IN LIFE. AND BY RISKS, I'M TALKING ABOUT TRYING NEW RESTAURANTS. THERE IS A RESTAURANT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, A KOREAN RESTAURANT. AND I'VE BEEN GOING BY THIS PLACE FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS. I NEVER TRIED IT. AND TWO WEEKS AGO I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, I GOING TO GIVE IT A SHOT. AND I DID AND GUESS WHAT? HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE FOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK IT'S A NAIL SALON DURING THE DAY OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NOT GOOD. NOT GOOD. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M TRYING NEW FOODS. I HAVE A FRIEND THAT DOESN'T TRY NEW FOODS. HE EATS THE SAME FOODS EVERY DAY PRETTY MUCH. I DON'T THINK HE'S EVER HAD ITALIAN FOOD. GOD, I MEAN, HE THINKS HE CAN'T GET A DISEASE IF HE HASN'T HEARD OF IT. [ LAUGHTER ] SOMETIMES WHEN WE'RE IN AN ARGUMENT AND I'M ANGRY AT HIM, I'LL JUST START YELLING OUT RARE DISEASES. LIKE, "DIVERTICULITIS, CHONDRAMALACIA!" [ LAUGHTER ] AND IF I CAN'T THINK OF A RARE DISEASE, I'LL YELL OUT AN ITIAN DISH. YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T KNOW. "PENNE AL ARRABIATA!" [ LAUGHTER ] HE THINKS IT'S A RARE DISEASE. "BRUSCHETTA!" HE'S CONFINED TO HIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW WITH A DEADLY FUSILLI BOLOGNESE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M NOT KIDDING AROUND. HE CALLED HIS DOCTOR. HE SAID, "WHAT SHOULD I DO FOR A FUSILI BOLOGNASE?" DOCTOR SAID, "JUST BOIL SOME WATER, THROW IT IN THERE." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? EVERYONE'S GOT THEIR OWN FEARS. WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN FEARS. MINE FOR A LONG TIME -- AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RATIONAL. MINE WAS SHARKS FOR A LONG TIME. BUT NO MORE. NOW? CHIMPANZEES. [ LAUGHTER ] HAVE YOU READ ABOUT THESE CHIMPANZEE ATTACKS? THEY RIP YOUR FACE OFF. THEY GO FOR THE CROTCH. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CUTE LITTLE CHIMPANZEE WITH THE SWEATER VESTS AND THE SUSPENDERS. THAT'S LARRY KING. I'M TALKING -- NO, NO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO, NO. I'M TALKING ABOUT E BIG, STRENGTH OF FOUR GROWN MEN CHIMPANZEES. FOUR GROWN MEN. THAT'S THE NUMBER THEY COME UP WITH ALL THE TIME. FOUR GROWN MEN. THEY MUST HAVE DONE A STUDY AT ONE POINT TO FIGURE THAT OUT. THEY START WITH ONE GROWN MAN. YOU KNOW, GET IN THE CAGE WITH THAT CHIMP. LET'S SEE WHO'S STRONGER. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, NO, NO, TWO! TWO GROWN MEN, TWO GROWN MEN! THREE, THREE, THREE! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] UNTIL THEY GET TO FOUR. IT COST SIX LIVES, THAT STUDY. BUT IT'S WORTH IT. THEY GOT THEIR ANSWER. IT'S FOUR. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT AT LEAST WITH A SHARK ATTACK, THERE'S NO DRAMA. YOU KNOW, IT JUST PULLS YOU DOWN. THERE'S NO MESS. YOU'RE LIKE, "HEY --" YOU'RE GONE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOUR FRIENDS DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. THEY'RE LIKE ON THE BEACH, YOU KNOW, WHERE'S KEVIN? "I THINK HE'S AT THE SNACK BAR. THROW ME THE FRISBEE." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, WITH THE CHIMPANZEE ATTACKS, CANOU IMAGINE THE HORROR? [ LAUGHTER ] IT PROBABLY SNEAKS UP BEHIND YOU. LIKE ON ONE OF THOSE LITTLE TRICYCLES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND I'M TELLING YOU, THE LAST MINUTE, THAT HORN ON THE HANDLEBAR? [ HONK SOUND ] YOU TURN AROUND -- FACE AND CROTCH! THEY GET YOUR JA SO THAT YOU CAN'T FIGHT EM. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO D THEN THEY GO FOR THE CROTCH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SERIOUSLY. WHO WANTS TO HAVE SEX AT THIS POINT? NOT ME. BECAUSE LIKE I SAID, I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR THE LAST 13 YEARS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.
