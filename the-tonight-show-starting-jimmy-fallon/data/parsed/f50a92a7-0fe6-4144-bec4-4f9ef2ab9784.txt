YOUR SWAG PROMOTING YOURSELF. JIMMY GETS WORRIED THAT HE DOESN'T GET RECOGNIZED ENOUGH.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO!
HE WEARS OUTFITS THAT ANNOUNCE "THE TONIGHT SHOW."
Jimmy: NO, NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE!
JUST IN CASE YOU SEE HIM AT THE COFFEE SHOP AND YOU'RE NOT SURE. "IS THAT JIMMY FALLON?" OH, IT'S HIS JACKET. IT'S DEFINITELY HIM. I KNOW YOU.
Jimmy: WHAT HAPPENED WAS -- IT WAS THE MOST EMBARRASSING. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS OF ALL TIME. I GOT A LEATHER JACKET MADE. AND I DON'T EVEN WEAR LEATHER JACKETS. BUT I FIGURED I WOULD WEAR IT. THEY SAID WE CAN ENGRAVE IT AND PUT WHAT -- NOT ENGRAVE IT, BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, STITCHING OR WHATEVER.
RIGHT
Jimmy: AND SO I GO, WHAT DO YOU WANT? I GO, "JUST PUT SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE ON IT."
RIGHT.
I GO, "OKAY, COOL." YEAH, YOU'RE ACTING LIKE THAT NOW. SO, I GET IT, I GO, "THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD." SO I WAS ASKING MICHAEL KEATON IF HE EVER WALKED AROUND WITH A A BATMAN T-SHIRT ON. HE WAS LIKE, "NO, I WOULD NEVER DO THAT. THANK I'M THAT STUPID." "OH YEAH, ME NEITHER." LL; BUT THEN ONE DAY -- ONE DAY OUT OF ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, I GO, "I'LL THROW THIS JACKET ON. WHY NOT?" I GO FOR A WALK. AND WHO DO I RUN INTO BUT ETHAN HAWKE? AND I GO, "HEY, MAN, HOW ARE YOU?" AND HE LOOKED AT THE THING AND HE GOES, "GOOD FOR YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD FOR ME?

Jimmy: THAT'S WHY YOU WERE HERE LAST TIME. NOW IT'S ON DVD AND ON DEMAND AND iTUNES, ALL THAT STUFF. GET IT, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, IT'S JUST FASCINATING. I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THIS GUY. YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
WELL THANK YOU.
Jimmy: NOW YOU HAVE A THIRD BOOK, THIS IS YOUR THIRD BOOK. THIS IS A DIFFERENT ONE. "RULES FOR A KNIGHT." FIRST OF ALL, HOW COOL IS IT -- WHOEVER, I DON'T KNOW WHO MADE THE BOOK, BUT --
DIDN'T THEY DO A GREAT JOB?
Jimmy: IT'S FANTASTIC.
IT'S SO COOL LOOKING.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE IT IN YOUR LIBRARY, THE BEST, AND A GOLD TASSEL ON THE BOTTOM. IT'S JUST SO RAD AND WELL DONE. I LOVE IT. IN THE BOOK, IT'S JUST DIFFERENT RULES LIKE HUMILITY, GRATITUDE, PRIDE, FRIENDSHIP.
SOLITUDE.
Jimmy: COURAGE.
COURAGE. FAITH, LOVE.
Jimmy: IT STARTED AS A THING YOU DID FOR YOUR KIDS.
RIGHT. IT STARTED OUT AS A DEAL MY WIFE AND I DID FOR CHRISTMAS. YOU KNOW HOW YOU TRY TO MAKE RULES FOR YOUR HOUSE, AND HOW IT WORKS? AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT FUN. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S DIFFICULT ABOUT PARENTING FROM A DIVORCED VANTAGE POINT IS THAT THERE'S THIS PRESSURE -- A A LOT OF DADS DO A LOT OF GUILTY PARENTING, BECAUSE ALL THE KID HAS TO SAY IS, "WELL, MOMMY WOULD NEVER MAKE ME BRUSH MY TEETH." YOU'RE LIKE, "AH, THROW THE TOOTHPASTE OUT!"
Jimmy: YOU DON'T NEED THAT. LET'S EAT SOME CANDY. YEAH, YEAH. THEN GO TO BED.
SO MY WIFE AND I HAD THIS IDEA TO MAKE RULES FUN. AND THIS WHOLE IDEA OF RULES FOR A KNIGHT, AND IT STARTED OUT AS SEVEN RULES AND WE DID IT AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT, AND THEN WE GOT A LITTLE LONGER AND MY WIFE DID THE ILLUSTRATIONS.
Jimmy: SHE DID A GREAT JOB, BY THE WAY.
THEY'RE REALLY COOL. AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT BIRDS. THE IDEA FOR HER WAS, I HAVE THREE DAUGHTERS, AND ONE SON, AND SO THE IDEA WAS HOW TO MAKE THESE IDEOLOGY OF KNIGHTS AND STUFF APPEALING TO BOTH GENDERS. THE GREAT THING ABOUT BIRDS IS THEY'RE NOT REALLY -- I MEAN THEY ARE MASCULINE AND FEMININE, BUT UNLESS YOU'RE A A GENIUS, YOU DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BIRDS LOOK LIKE BIRDS.
OH, THE RED FEATHER IS THE GIRL CARDINAL. YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YOU'RE THINKING TOO MUCH. JUST ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL BIRD. YEAH. AND WHAT DID YOUR DAUGHTERS SAY WHEN YOU SHOWED THEM? YOU MADE IT INTO A BOOK.
I DID ALL THIS STUFF FOR THEM. MY OLDEST DAUGHTER PICKED IT UP, SHE'S LIKE, "WOW, DAD, YOUR NAME'S PRETTY BIG. [ LAUGHTER ] IS IT A BOOK ABOUT A KNIGHT OR IS IT BOOK ABOUT YOU?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHERE IS THE HUMILITY, DAD?
EXACTLY. "SO AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK THAT YOU'RE A KNIGHT, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE NICEST KIDS, I GOTTA SAY. I LOVE THEM. THE CUTEST KIDS. THE NICEST KIDS. BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT BOOK EVEN FOR ADULTS. AS WELL, BECAUSE IT REMINDS YOU, OH, YEAH, ALWAYS GOOD TO GET A REMINDER OF WHAT --
YOU DON'T USUALLY HAVE AN EXCUSE WITH YOUR KIDS TO TALK ABOUT -- YOU KNOW, UNLESS YOU'RE, I DON'T KNOW, I ALWAYS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO FIND A A REASON TO TALK ABOUT, SO WHY ARE YOU NOT SUPPOSED TO LIE? EVERYBODY SAYS YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO, BUT WHY NOT? WHAT'S FUN IS FOR THE YEARS I HAVE BEEN COLLECTING THESE DIFFERENT PARABLES -- YOU KNOW, LIKE LITTLE ZEN KOANS A LITTLE JEDI MANTRAS. JUST THINGS THAT YOU CAN -- YOU SEE HIS EYES? THEY JUST WENT LIKE, JEDI?
Jimmy: I'M LIKE A LITTLE KID.
I WAS GETTING BORING AND I SAID "JEDI" AND I GOT INTERESTING AGAIN.
Jimmy: I'M ALWAYS INTERESTED, BUT YOU SAY "JEDI"? YEAH.
I HAVE BEEN COLLECTING THESE PARABLES FOR YEARS, BECAUSE I LIKE THEM, BECAUSE THEY DON'T DICTATE TO YOU HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO THINK. THEY JUST TELL YOU A STORY AND YOU USE YOUR OWN BRAIN.
Jimmy: I WROTE A BOOK TOO. SAME IDEA AS YOURS, PARABLES. "YOUR BABY'S FIRST WORD WILL BE DADA." IT'S ALMOST THE SAME AS YOUR BOOK. IT JUST SAYS LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S PRETTY FUN. LIKE, "DADA SQUEAK." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] STUFF LIKE THAT. A GREAT BOOK. AGAIN, YOU WANT TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS LIKE THAT WITH YOUR KIDS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE DON'T HANG AROUND THE SAME BOOK CLUBS. WE'LL NEVER BUMP INTO EACH OTHER EVER, YEAH. NO, I WASN'T PLUGGING MY BOOK. IT IS MUCH LARGER THAN YOURS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I'M JUST SAYING, WHAT DOES IT MATTER? [ APPLAUSE ] WHO IS COUNTING? [ LAUGHTER ] NO BIG DEAL. WHATEVER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS, I GOTTA SAY, THIS IS GOOD. THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS BOOK GO TO CHARITY.
YEAH, WELL, MY WIFE AND I, WE HAVE SOME DIFFERENT LEARNING DISABILITIES IN OUR FAMILY. SO, ONE OF THE WAYS WE FIGURED WE COULD TAKE THIS THING WE DID IT FOR OUR FAMILY, SHARE IT WITH THE WORLD AND MAYBE TAKE WHAT WE MAKE FROM IT AND HELP OTHER FAMILIES.
Jimmy: GOOD FOR YOU. SEE THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHY YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE. ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND I NEVER WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT "BOYHOOD", AND I WAS LIKE, "WHY DIDN'T YOU?" BUT I'M HAPPY YOU DIDN'T.
OKAY.
Jimmy: AND ALSO I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE AT THE -- IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK, YOU HAVE A SPECIAL THANKS TO OTHER KNIGHTS.
KNIGHTS THAT I LEARNED THINGS FROM.
Jimmy: PEOPLE THAT YOU LEARNED THINGS FROM LIKE MUHAMMAD ALI. AND LIKE HEROES OF YOURS I GUESS, RIGHT? BOB DYLAN.
MM-HMM.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T SEE MY NAME IN HERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, DID IT NOT--
Jimmy: THERE'S A LOT OF NAMES. THERE'S ACTUALLY ROOM FOR MORE.
YOU KNOW WHAT'S STRANGE?
Jimmy: AND, YOU DIDN'T RUN OUT OF SPACE.
I FIND THIS REALLY EMBARRASSING FOR THIS TO COME UP THIS WAY. THERE IS A SECOND DRAFT COMING OUT, AND THERE WILL BE AN ODE TO YOU, AN ACTUAL FULL-ON POEM FOR YOU.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, IT'S CALLED "BALLAD OF JIMMY."
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
AND IN PARENTHESES DADA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOT "DAH-DAH", "DA-DA"
I THINK I MADE IT TOO DEEP FOR A SECOND.
Jimmy: I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS. SHOULD I BE INSULTED, BECAUSE I HAD YOU ON THE SHOW A BUNCH OF TIMES, AND I HAVE RUN INTO YOU ON THE STREETS AND YOU'VE INSULTED ME AND STUFF. SO I GO, MAYBE I'VE EARNED SOMETHING. THEN I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE ONE OF MY HEROES. IT WOULD BE WEIRD IF YOU LOOKED AT ME AS ONE OF YOUR HEROES. BECAUSE THAT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU'RE QUICKLY BECOMING ONE OF MY HEROES. THE JOB YOU'RE DOING ON THIS SHOW, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HAVE NEVER SEEN -- I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES SOMEBODY COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS, "YOU GOTTA SEE LAST NIGHT'S SHOW. YOU GOTTA YOUTUBE--" I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW OFTEN THAT HAPPENS, JIMMY.
Jimmy: IT'S ALL BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU COME ON THE SHOW AND BE AWESOME AND THE CROWD APPRECIATES IT AND WE APPRECIATE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CONGRATS TO YOU, BEST TO THE FAMILY. I'M GOING TO GET YOU THAT JACKET.

Jimmy: LOOKING SHARP. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW.
THANKS, MAN.
Jimmy: I'M SO PSYCHED TO HAVE YOU. CAUSE I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS.
I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOURS, YOUR SHOW, YOUR BAND.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. OH, THE ROOTS, YOU CAN'T BEAT THE ROOTS. THEY'RE THE GREATEST. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A LOT TO GET INTO. BUT FOR THOSE FOLKS OUT THERE THAT DON'T KNOW YOU, TELL US A A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF, WHERE ARE YOU FROM, EVEN?
I AM FROM MANHATTAN.
Jimmy: YOU ARE.
NEW YORK.
Jimmy: NEW YORK BOY. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH, I GREW UP DOING THEATER HERE AND I MOVED TO CONNECTICUT AND DID A LITTLE TIME IN PENNSYLVANIA. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
NOW I'M -- ALL RIGHT, OKAY. NOW I'M BACK IN BROOKLYN.
Jimmy: HEY, ALL RIGHT, SEE, YOU'RE HITTING EVERY BOROUGH. THAT'S FANTASTIC. NOW, DID YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE AN ACTOR, AS A KID? DID YOU GO, "THAT'S IT. I GOT MY CALLING." WERE YOU PARENTS INTO IT? WHAT WAS IT?
YEAH, I MEAN, I STARTED DOING THEATER HERE GROWING UP, BUT THE FIRST DREAM I HAD WAS TO BE IN THE NBA. AND I WANTED TO PLAY BASKETBALL. THIS IS PROBABLY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL WHEN THE DREAM WAS STRONG. AND I WAS SHORT, WHITE AND I WORE GLASSES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO MY PROSPECTS WERE STRONG.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
BUT I DECIDED TO GO ANOTHER ROUTE. AND, YOU KNOW, AT ONE POINT, I ALSO WANTED TO TRY AND PLAY SOME MUSIC.
Jimmy: YOU DID?
YEAH.
Jimmy: WERE YOU EVER IN A A BAND?
YEAH, I'VE BEEN IN A FEW BANDS.
Jimmy: I ALWAYS ASK EVERYONE, WHAT'S THE NAME OF YOUR BAND? LAME OR COOL?
ALL RIGHT, WELL --
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. HERE WE GO. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, YEAH. THIS WAS LIKE MY DIANE SAWYER MOMENT. YEAH, THIS IS WHERE I GET SOMETHING JUICY OUT OF YOU.
NO, THAT'S OKAY. I ACTUALLY HAVE TWO HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS HERE TONIGHT WHO WERE IN THE FIRST BAND I EVER WAS IN. AND THAT BAND WAS CALLED NO GUM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WOW. OKAY.
IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN COOL, AND WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON THAT.
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T WANT ANYONE CHEWING GUM WATCHING YOU?
NO, NO, NO. ONE OF OUR BAND MATES IS SORT OF A FRIEND, HE'S FUNNY BUT HE'S ALSO ACCIDENTALLY FUNNY. I MEAN, HE'S THE GUY WHERE LIKE, THE PARTY'S NOT RIGHT UNTIL HE'S FALLING OVER SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, SOMEWHERE.
Jimmy: I KNOW THAT GUY. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND HIS NAME'S ANDREW.
Jimmy: ALL TOO WELL, ALL TOO WELL. I KNOW HIM REAL WELL, YEAH.
HIS NAME'S ANDREW. AND I THINK THE STORY BEHIND NO GUM IS THAT LITERALLY, I THINK ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAID TO HIM, "ANDREW, ARE YOU DUMB?" AND HE WENT, "NO, NO GUM." [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE WERE LIKE, ALL RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S, YOU KNOW -- I THINK WE MADE FUN OF HIM FOREVER ABOUT THAT. AND THEN IT BECAME COOL ENOUGH TO BE THE BAND NAME. THIS IS ALSO THE SAME PERSON, WHERE ONE TIME, SOMEBODY SAID, "HEY, ANDREW, YOU LOOK TALL." AND HE SAID, "NO, MY SHOES ARE JUST DIRTY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHATEVER. YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S TOO LONG TO BE A BAND NAME. "NO GUM" IS BETTER. YEAH. WELL, I'M HAPPY YOU TOOK THE CHOICE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW BECAUSE MAN, YOU'RE FANTASTIC. EVERY TIME I SEE YOU, I GO, OH MY GOSH THIS GUY IS PHENOMENAL. I MEAN, YOU'RE A FANTASTIC ACTOR. THIS NEW FILM "YOUTH", WHO DIRECTED THIS ONE?
THIS GUY PAOLO SORRENTINO, AN ITALIAN FILMMAKER. HE DID "THE GREAT BEAUTY," WHICH WAS OUT A FEW YEARS AGO. WON A FOREIGN LANGUAGE OSCAR. YEAH, HE'S A BEAUTIFUL FILMMAKER.
Jimmy: BEAUTIFULLY SHOT. AND IT'S JUST A TRICKY SUBJECT, BUT IT'S SO GREAT. I MEAN, GREAT ACTING. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP OF PAUL DANO AND MICHAEL CAINE. YOU'RE IN A MOVIE WITH MICHAEL CAINE. IT'S CALLED "YOUTH." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. WELL DESERVED.
I HAVE WORKED WITH ALL THE GREAT EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN DIRECTORS. BUT I'LL BE REMEMBERED FOREVER FOR "MR. Q." FOR A -- ROBOT. I HAD TO WEAR A SUIT OF ARMOR THAT WEIGHED 200 POUNDS. YOU COULDN'T EVEN SEE MY FACE, BUT EVERY FIVE MINUTES, SOMEBODY HAS TO COME UP AND REMIND ME THAT I DID "MR. Q." THE SAME WAY THEY REMIND YOU THAT YOU DID THOSE SIMPLE SONGS. AND THEY FORGET THAT YOU ALSO COMPOSED "THE BLACK PRISM," "THE LIFE OF ADRIAN" AND ALL THE REST.
BECAUSE LEVITY IS ALSO A A PERVERSION. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT'S FUN. OH, IT'S A GREAT MOVIE. I LOVED IT. AND ALSO, "LOVE AND MERCY," MAN, OH, MAN, DID YOU KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK BEING BRIAN WILSON. LOOK AT THIS PICTURE BACK HERE. CAN YOU ZOOM INTO THAT? IT LOOKS LIKE A PICTURE OF BRIAN WILSON. THAT'S YOU. THAT'S JUST AMAZING. WHAT A GREAT JOB YOU DID IN THIS. AND YOU CAN SING, TOO.
YEAH, I CAN SING A LITTLE BIT. THIS WAS THE MOST FUN I EVER HAD ACTING, I THINK, BRIAN. HIS SPIRIT, LIKE HE'S JUST AN AMAZING, AMAZING MAN.
Jimmy: DID YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE BEACH BOYS GOING IN?
I THOUGHT I DID. BUT THEN -- I MEAN, THAT'S ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS, I THINK, ABOUT THE FILM. I DIDN'T KNOW HIS STORY AND THE FACT A GUY WHO WENT THROUGH SO MUCH PAIN AND STRUGGLE MADE MUSIC THAT MADE SO MANY PEOPLE SMILE, REALLY MOVES ME.
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. WE DON'T -- THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME ON THE SHOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW BEFORE, BUT WE MAKE OUR GUESTS SING, EVERY GUEST.
EVERY GUEST? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: EVERY GUEST DOES. EVERY GUEST DOES IT. ETHAN JUST SANG. ETHAN HAWKE JUST SANG. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU MISSED IT. I CAN DO SOMETHING WITH YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE.
I WILL SING IF YOU SING WITH ME.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, DO YOU MIND DOING A "BEACH BOYS" SONG?
LET'S DO IT. LET'S DO IT.
Jimmy: ROOTS, YOU WANT TO DO --
WHAT DO YOU KNOW? I WANT YOU TO PICK AN OPTION.
Jimmy: "BARBARA ANN?" WE CAN DO "BARBARA ANN," RIGHT? EVERYONE KNOWS THAT ONE.
