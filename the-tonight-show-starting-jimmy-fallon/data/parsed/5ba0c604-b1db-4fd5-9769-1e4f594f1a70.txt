Jimmy: DO YOU DEAL WITH ELMO MUCH? DID YOU EVER DO ANY --
I GREW UP ON ELMO. I MEAN, WATCHING ELMO. NOT ON ELMO. I DID HAVE AN ELMO DOLL, SO I PROBABLY SPENT SOME TIME ON HIM WHEN I WAS A CHILD.
Jimmy: A VERY FRIENDLY SHOW, BECAUSE YOU ALSO KNOW JASON SCHWARTZMAN AS WELL?

WE'VE JUST REACHED A A CULTURAL IMPACT.
Jimmy: WE REALLY DID. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT SHOW. A VERY SPECIAL EPISODE OF "THE TONIGHT SHOW."
NAILED TO THIS ONE AGAIN.
Jimmy: WE SHOULD GET TO A A DECENT ISSUE HERE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN YOUR HOME COUNTRY OF IRELAND.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, THEY LEGALIZED GAY MARRIAGE.
THEY DID.
Jimmy: CRAZY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC. GOOD FOR IRELAND. IRELAND, OF ALL PLACES, TOO.
THE COUNTRY WILL OBVIOUSLY SINK INTO A FIERY PIT OF DAMNATION -- DAMNATION BY THE END OF THE MONTH I'M SURE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR YOU.
MY BROTHER LEFT THE SHORES OF IRELAND. THAT'S SO DRAMATIC, LEFT THE SHORES. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HE LITERALLY DID. BUT HE;S ABOVE THEM BY ABOUT 36,000 FEET, BUT HE WENT --. BUT HE WENT. HE LEFT THE SHORES, AND HE WENT WEST.
Jimmy: IT SOUNDS LIKE A A SONG, ALMOST. ♪ HE LEFT THE SHORES OF IRELAND AND THEN WE FLEW AMERICAN AIRLINES ♪ ♪ AND LANDED IN LOS ANGELES ♪ THERE, YEAH. IT'S A GREAT SONG.
SO, HE WENT TO VANCOUVER AND MARRIED HIS PARTNER SEVEN YEARS AGO, STEVEN, AND SO, YEAH, I'VE WATCHED DAMON -- YOU KNOW, I'VE WATCHED HIM GO THROUGH HIS LIFE AND I HAVE WATCHED HIM FACE DIFFICULTIES SOCIALLY AND BE POLARIZED AND PUSHED ASIDE. AND TO SEE IRELAND COME OUT, I THINK THE VOTE WAS 61 OR 62% IN FAVOR OF IT, WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH A REALLY A DECENT PART OF THE COUNTRY. RESPECT TO THOSE WHO VOTED NO AS WELL. I MEAN, YOU CAN'T -- I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TREAT THOSE WHO ARE AGAINST WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF ANGST OR ANGER OR FRUSTRATION THAT YOU FEEL YOU'VE BEEN TREATED WITH AS WELL. BUT THE MAIN THING WAS IT WENT THROUGH AT 62%. IT WAS REALLY COOL. AND OF COURSE, GOD BLESS THEM, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SAID "IT'S A DARK DAY FOR THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND." AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE FOOTAGE AND IT'S JUST RAINBOWS EVERYWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WASN'T THAT DARK.
EVERYWHERE.
Jimmy: EVERYONE'S DANCING AND LAUGHING.
EVERYONE'S DANCING, AND, YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: PEOPLE ARE GOING CRAZY.
AND YOU KNOW GERRY ADAMS, WHO WAS THE HEAD OF SINN FEIN, AND WAS A VERY PROVOCATIVE FIGURE IN IRISH POLITICS. A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL, DEFINITELY, VERY DIFFERENT THINGS FOR GERRY ADAMS. THERE'S A PICTURE OF HIM WITH MISS PANTY, THE DRAG QUEEN, GETTING A SELFIE. IT WAS AN AMAZING DAY OLD AND YOUNG ALIKE. THE WHOLE COUNTRY CAME TOGETHER. IT'S A MASSIVE GESTURE OF LOVE. AND THAT'S THE REALLY COOL THING.
Jimmy: GOOD FOR YOU, AND GOOD FOR YOUR BROTHER.
THANKS, MAN.
Jimmy: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT "TRUE DETECTIVE" HERE.
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU GOING TO TV IS A A BIG DEAL FOR ME. I'M A BIG COLIN FARRELL FAN. I'M USED TO SEEING YOU ON THE MOVIES. YOU'RE A MOVIE STAR. AND THEN, YOU READ THE SCRIPT?
YES. IT WAS JUST SO GOOD. IT READS SO GOOD. I READ THE FIRST TWO EPISODES. I MET NIC PIZZOLATTO, THE WRITER AND CREATOR OF THE FIRST SEASON.

HE IS, HE'S REALLY INTERESTING. NIC'S A SWEETHEART, BUT HE'S A A TOUGH GUY. YEAH.
Jimmy: THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON. YOU SEE THESE SHOWS, AND YOU GO --
HE'S A STRONG MAN. AND HE REALLY IS. HE'S A TOUGH GUY, AND HE CARES ABOUT THE MATERIAL AND HE CARES ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF WHAT HE WRITES. AND HE LOCKS HIMSELF IN AN OFFICE, ABOUT A FOUR STORY, FOR EIGHT OR NINE HOURS A DAY AWAY FROM HIS WIFE AND HIS DAUGHTER. AND HE GOES TO A DARK PLACE TO CREATE THE FICTION THAT HE CREATES. BUT, HE'S A REALLY KINDHEARTED MAN. ANYWAY, BACK TO THE SCHPIEL.
Jimmy: IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S ONE SCENE WHERE YOUR SON IS GETTING BULLIED, AND THEN YOU DO SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US PROBABLY --
WISH WE COULD DO AND GET AWAY WITH?
Jimmy: YOU GO TO THE BULLY'S HOUSE AND HAVE A TALKING TO WITH THE FATHER.
WE HAVE A LITTLE WORD, YEAH.
Jimmy: A LITTLE WORD. I DON'T THINK HE GETS A WORD OUT. SOMETHING, YEAH.
SHOULDN'T LAUGH.
Jimmy: HE MIGHT GET KNOCKED DOWN. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING -- SO YEAH, HE GOES TO A DARK PLACE, THERE. YOU HAVE GOT A GREAT CAST. I MEAN, VINCE VAUGHN, I LOVE THAT DUDE.
LOVE VINCE.
Jimmy: HE COULDN'T BE MORE FUN, AND WHAT A GREAT ACTOR. [ CHEERS ] I LOVE VINCE VAUGHN. RACHEL McADAMS.
AMAZING. YEAH.
Jimmy: TAYLOR KITSCH.
YEAH, AMAZING. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO WORK WITH TAYLOR MORE. I DID TWO SCENES WITH HIM, I THINK. I WORKED A LOT WITH VINCE, WHICH I LOVED. I WORKED A LOT WITH RACHEL, AND RACHEL IS EXTRAORDINARY. I MEAN, SHE REALLY IS.
Jimmy: IT'S SET IN LOS ANGELES NOW, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: SO YOU'RE A A DETECTIVE, AND VINCE --
USING THE TERM LOOSELY, I'M A DETECTIVE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH. KIND OF ON THE DOWN SLOPE OF A A CAREER THAT WAS NEVER REALLY RISING.
Jimmy: YEAH. HE'S NOT THE --
DOWN AND OUT. ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES. A BROKEN MAN. ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY FRACTURED IN THEIR OWN WAY AND VINCE'S CHARACTER KIND OF HAS ME IN HIS BACK POCKET BECAUSE OF A BIT OF INFORMATION THAT HE HAS ON ME THAT COULD BRING EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE DOWN IF IT WAS EXPOSED. AND SO, I'M KIND OF JOSTLING BETWEEN VINCE, HIS CHARACTER, AND HE IS KIND OF SOMEWHAT OF A, YOU KNOW, WHITE COLLAR CRIMINAL WHO'S TRYING TO GO GOOD. AND THE CORRUPT POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT I'M ALSO REPRESENTING.
Jimmy: YOU ARE REPRESENTING IT VERY WELL. VERY CORRECTLY. WE HAVE A -- I HAVE A CLIP. HERE IS COLIN FARRELL IN "TRUE DETECTIVE." SEASON TWO STARTS SUNDAY NIGHT, 9:00 P.M. ON HBO. CHECK THIS OUT.
SO WHY DO YOU FEEL YOUR VISITATION RIGHTS SHOULD BE EXPANDED, DETECTIVE VELCORO?
WELL, HOW ABOUT I RAISED HIM ALONE FOR TWO MONTHS WHEN SHE TOOK OFF? YOU KNOW, IT WAS ME AND HIM. SHE COMES BACK, SHE'S TALKING DIVORCE.
DID EITHER OF YOU REQUEST A A PATERNITY TEST?
NO, MY SON IS MY SON.
THEY'RE GONNA ASK THAT QUESTION. MORE RUDELY THAN I DO.
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT GETTING -- THERE'S ME AND HIM. AND I'M HIS DAD. AND I JUST NEED YOU TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT?

Jimmy: DO YOU GET MASSAGES A A LOT?
I DON'T. I ACTUALLY HAD A REALLY CRAZY EXPERIENCE HAPPEN A FEW YEARS AGO. I DON'T LIKE MASSAGES. I WENT TO GO GET ONE, BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF HAVING A MORE STRESSFUL PERIOD OF MY LIFE. SO I GO TO THIS LIKE SPA FOR A A DAY -- A DAY TREATMENT THING. AND I GOT THIS ONE MASSAGE, IT WAS REALLY NICE AND I WAS FEELING REAL LOOSY GOOSY. SO, I WENT TO THIS ROOM WHERE I WAS GETTING THIS THING CALLED A A SEA SALT SCRUB. WHICH WAS CRAZY. I WALKED INTO THE ROOM AND IT WAS LIKE, IT LOOKED LIKE A A THEMED -- YOU KNOW THAT SHOW THE NICK? IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THAT. IT WAS A GIANT --
Jimmy: SO WEIRD. LIKE A HOSPITAL?
A TILED ROOM WITH A METAL TABLE IN IT AND A GIANT RAIN FAUCET ABOVE IT. AND THERE WAS THIS WOMAN IN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HER NAME WAS DOTTY. AND SHE -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] SHE SAID HER NAME WAS DOTTY. AND THEN SHE HANDED ME LIKE THIS WEIRD -- DON'T STOP. THIS WEIRD LIKE, BALL OF FABRIC.
Jimmy: YEAH, THIS FEELS GOOD.
AND LIKE IT IS A DISPOSABLE UNDERWEAR TYPE THING.
Jimmy: LIKE UNDERWEAR. YEAH. YOU GOT TO PUT THAT ON.
AND SO SHE SAID TO ME "PUT THESE ON. I'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND." AND I WAS FEELING SO COCKY THAT I WAS LIKE, DOTTY. YOU MIGHT NEED TO GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES, BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THIS ON.
Jimmy: SHE LEFT YOU UNDERWEAR?
YEAH, TO PUT THEM ON, RIGHT? BUT, SO SHE LEFT THE ROOM. THAT'S SO GOOD. DO I FEEL STRESSED? HOW DOES IT FEEL TO YOU, ASHTRAY?
I FEEL FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: ASHTRAY, I THINK THEY'RE MASSAGING EACH OTHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
COURTNEY. ASHTRAY. COURTNEY. SORRY, SO ANYWAY. I'M IN THIS ROOM AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE EVER HAD THIS. BUT I WAS IN THIS ROOM TRYING TO PUT ON THESE, THESE UNDERWEAR. AND I PUT THEM ON AS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD GO ON, BUT THEY WERE A G-STRING WITH A VERY BALLOONY FRONT. AND I WAS LIKE, WELL, THAT'S NOT RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY'RE TICKLING.
SO THEN -- NO, IT'S GOOD. IT WAS NICE.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT WAS A A GOOD. MASSAGE.
I'VE GOT TO TELL THE STORY. I'VE GOT TO TELL THE STORY! SO -- SO THEN, YOU CAN DO IT AFTER. SO THEN --
Jimmy: SO YOU PUT THEM ON.
SO I PUT ON THE G-STRING AND I'M LIKE, THAT'S NOT RIGHT. SO I PULL THEM DOWN.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
AND I LIKE KIND OF MOVED ON TO WHERE IT'S ONE CLICK OVER, AND THEN I PULLED THEM UP. BUT THEN IT WAS WEIRDER BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE A G-STRING BUT TO THE SIDE. SO THE FRONT OF IT WAS LIKE GOING HALF UP THE CENTER OF MY BODY AND HALF ON TOP PART MY LEG.
Jimmy: WEIRD.
WHICH IS, YES. THEN I TOOK THAT DOWN AND THEN I MOVED IT AGAIN AND I ROTATED, WHICH WAS KIND OF LIKE A A RUBIK'S CUBE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT. AND I'M STARTING TO GET STRESSED OUT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
BECAUSE DOTTY'S KNOCKING AND CAN I COME IN? CAN I COME IN? WELL, FINALLY I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT MUST JUST BE A G-STRING. SO I PUT THEM ON G-STRING STYLE. AND THEN I PUT THE TOWEL ON ME AND I LAID ON THE TABLE AND SHE CAME IN AND SAID "DOTTY, I'M READY." SHE CAME IN, AND SHE WAS PUTTING SALTS ON ME AND THEN SHE LIFTED UP THIS TOWEL TO KIND OF LIKE BILLOW IT, AND THEN I FELT THE TOWEL START TO LIKE SHAKE A LITTLE AND SHE STARTED LAUGHING LIKE THAT. AND I SAID WHAT'S GOING ON? AND SHE SAID, "IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A G-STRING." AND I WAS SO EMBARRASSED WHEN SHE SAID THAT, THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REACT. SO I PUT MY TUSHIE IN THE AIR, AND I STARTED TO LIKE SHAKE IT LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE THIS, AND I SAID, "I KNOW IT'S NOT A G-STRING, DOTTY BUT I WAS DOING IT FOR YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] SO THEN I JUST TRIED TO GO RIGHT INTO IT.
