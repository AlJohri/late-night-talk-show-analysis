Questlove: 237, CAMEROON!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY! LOOKING GOOD! WELCOME! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HERE WE ARE IN NEW YORK AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW"! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GUYS ARE HERE, THANK YOU! AWESOME! THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME. THANKS FOR WATCHING. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I READ THAT YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA REDUCED THE SENTENCE OF 22 FEDERAL PRISONERS WHO WERE ARRESTED FOR DRUG-RELATED CRIMES, EIGHT OF WHOM WERE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES. IT MARKS THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE SAID "THANKS, OBAMA," AND ACTUALLY MEANT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] THANKS, OBAMA. NO, I MEAN IT, THANKS! AND GET THIS, IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS HIRED A RESEARCH DIRECTOR TO GENERATE POSITIVE STORIES ABOUT HER IN THE NEWS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THAT THEY COULD MOVE PAST HER E-MAIL SCANDAL. AND IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE HER LOOK GOOD. CHECK OUT SOME OF THESE HEADLINES, THESE STORIES THEY'RE PUTTING UP HERE. FIRST, THERE'S "HILLARY INVENTS METHOD FOR GETTING STRAW INTO CAPRI SUN POUCH, FIRST TRY."
Steve: WOW! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! YOU CAN'T DO THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S ANOTHER STORY. "HILLARY FORCES TIME-WARNER REPAIRMEN TO GIVE YOU A A 20-MINUTE WINDOW INSTEAD OF A A TWO-HOUR WINDOW." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH! THEN THEY RELEASED THIS STORY. "HILLARY MEERKATS BILL MUMBLING TO HIMSELF IN BATHROOM, WINS INTERNET." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS ] EVERYONE'S MEERKATING. AND FINALLY, THIS IS THE BEST ONE. "HILLARY SAYS, 'ALL GUAC AT CHIPOTLE THIS YEAR, ON ME!'" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ THANK YOU, HILLARY! THANK YOU, HILLARY! GUAC'S EXTRA, MAN, YEAH.
Steve: FREE GUAC.
Jimmy: WE ALL KNOW THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE HILLARY CLINTON LOOK BAD. IN FACT, MARCO RUBIO CRITICIZED HILLARY FOR USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER, AND SAID IT "MADE HER SUSCEPTIBLE TO FOREIGN ESPIONAGE." THOUGH, COMING FROM A GUY NAMED MARCO RUBIO, THAT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE FLIRTING, DOESN'T IT? [ LAUGHTER ] [ SPANISH ACCENT ] I HEAR YOU ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FOREIGN ESPIONAGE, YES? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO? I LOVE YOU. I HATE YOU. [ SLAP SOUND ] [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] I ALSO HEARD THAT RAND PAUL IS TAKING A WEEK-LONG BREAK FROM TALKING TO THE MEDIA TO SPEND TIME WITH HIS FAMILY BEFORE HE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCES THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE NOTHING MOTIVATES YOU TO BE ON THE ROAD FOR TWO STRAIGHT YEARS LIKE A WEEK ALONE WITH YOUR FAMILY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT, HONEY, I'M READY TO GO. ANOTHER POTENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION IS WISCONSIN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER, BUT NOW THEY'RE SAYING HIS DOG ALLERGY COULD MAKE HIM LESS LIKABLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: YOU THINK THEY ARE OVERTHINKING EVERYTHING? WHAT'S WRONG WITH PEOPLE? THEY'RE SAYING THAT HIS DOG ALLERGY IS GOING TO MAKE HIM LESS LIKABLE TO VOTERS. THAT'S JUST THE BEST. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, MIGHT BE RIGHT. LET'S LOOK AT THIS SCOTT WALKER CAMPAIGN AD I SAW, WATCH.
MY NAME IS SCOTT WALKER, I'M THE GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN, AND I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [ SNEEZING ] [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THIS COUNTRY. [ SNEEZING ] AMERICA IS A PLACE WHERE -- SORRY, I'M GOING TO SNEEZE. WAIT, NO, I'M NOT. AMERICA IS A PLACE -- [ SNEEZING ] DAMN IT! I'M SCOTT WALKER, AND I'M ALLERGIC TO [ BLEEP ] DOGS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AWW, COME ON.
Steve: THEY SHOULD CALL HIM DOG WALKER.
Jimmy: THE DOG WALKER.
Steve: YEAH, DOG WALKER.
Jimmy: WHY DO THEY HAVE A A DOG IN THE SOUND BOOTH? [ LAUGHTER ] UNBELIEVABLE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS ISN'T GOOD, YOU GUYS. I READ THAT WASHINGTON, D.C. IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH GEESE DROPPINGS AT THE CITY'S MOST POPULAR LANDMARKS. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] THEN BIDEN WAS LIKE, "ACTUALLY, I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HONK, HONK. HONK, HONK. I HAVE TO MAKE A GEESE -- GOOSE SOUND. OF COURSE, THIS CONTROVERSY OVER INDIANA'S ANTI -- YEAH, CON-TRA-VERSY. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, THIS CONTROVERSY OVER INDIANA'S ANTI-GAY RELIGIOUS FREEDOM LAW JUST KEEPS ON GOING. IN FACT, INDIANA GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE ACTUALLY HELD A A PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY TO CLARIFY THE LAW. HE WAS LIKE, LOOK, I WANT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT -- I MEAN, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE STRAIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] UH -- I'M JUST MAKING IT WORSE. [ LAUGHTER ] BIT OF A SCANDAL HERE WITH STUBHUB. YOU KNOW STUBHUB?
Steve: MM-HMM.
Jimmy: YEAH. WELL, STUBHUB IS ACCUSING ITS COMPETITOR TICKETMASTER OF WORKING TO CANCEL TICKETS THAT WERE RESOLD ON ITS SITE. BIG WAR, YEAH. TODAY, TICKETMASTER SENT STUBHUB THIS RESPONSE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WHY, I NEVER!
Jimmy: THIS MADE ME LAUGH. YESTERDAY, A COUPLE OF NEWSCASTERS WERE TRYING TO DO A A WEATHER REPORT TOGETHER. I'M NOT SURE IF THEY LIKE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH. AND IT'S -- YOU COULD TELL, THERE WAS LITTLE PASSIVE AGGRESSIVENESS COMING. CHECK THIS OUT. WATCH THIS.
SMELLS LIKE ORANGE BLOSSOMS.
OH, GOT IT, YEAH.
WHAT DID YOU THINK I MEANT?
I SMELL YOUR HAIR SPRAY MAINLY. I MEAN, I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY THAT.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, I'M TOLD.
