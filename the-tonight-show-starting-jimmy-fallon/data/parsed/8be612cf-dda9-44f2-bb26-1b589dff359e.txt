Jimmy: OH, HEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, HEY! HO! HEY! HO! HEY! HO! HEY! HO! I GIVE PROPS TO HIP HOP, SO HIP HOP HOORAY. NO. HEY, GUYS, WELCOME -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT FELT LIKE THAT AUDIENCE. IT FELT LIKE THAT ENERGY. WELCOME, YOU'RE HERE; YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW." WELCOME, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE'VE GOT A HOT SHOW TONIGHT. GREAT SHOW, YOU GUYS. WE HAVE BOTH SNOOP DOGG AND BILL O'REILLY ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IN OTHER WORDS, WE HAVE ONE GUY WHO LEANS TO THE RIGHT, AND ANOTHER WHO PASSES TO THE LEFT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT IS VERY INTERESTING. LET'S GET TO THE NEWS HERE. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS ADDING PEOPLE TO HER CAMPAIGN TEAM WHO WILL FOCUS ON PREVENTING SCANDALS. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY JUST FOLLOW BILL AROUND AND GO, "NO! [ LAUGHTER ] PUT HER DOWN. PUT HER DOWN! NO! GET! BILL, BILL!" [ APPLAUSE ] DID YOU SEE THIS? IN A NEW INTERVIEW, R&B SINGER NE-YO SAID THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS HIS FAVORITE CANDIDATE, AND THAT IF HE WROTE A SONG ABOUT HER IT WOULD BE CALLED "SUPERWOMAN." YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE CALLING THE SONG "RED, WHITE AND BOOTY" WOULD HAVE BEEN WEIRD. [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF HILLARY. HER YOUNGER BROTHER, TONY, IS FACING SOME CRITICISM FOR USING THE CLINTONS' POLITICAL CONNECTIONS TO HELP HIS CAREER. SO ON THE DOWNSIDE, SHE HAS A A SKETCHY BROTHER NAMED TONY; ON THE UPSIDE, SHE JUST LOCKED UP EVERY VOTE IN NEW JERSEY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, I GOT TWO SKETCHY BROTHERS NAMED TONY! I LIKE THAT LADY. SHE'S RIGHT OVER HERE! FORGET ABOUT IT. THAT'S FOR YOU. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THAT'S FOR YOU. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: TONY!
Jimmy: I GOT TWO BROTHERS NAMED TONY THEY'RE SKETCHY OVER HERE. BOOM! YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAND IT TO ME LIKE THAT. IT'S WEIRD. GIVE ME MONEY, IF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME MONEY.
Steve: IT'S $1.
Jimmy: DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. NOTHING HAPPENING. DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT.
Steve: IT'S A QUARTER.
Jimmy: WHAT'S THAT?
Steve: YOU GAVE ME A A QUARTER.
Jimmy: THAT'S 25 CENTS OVER HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW IT'S OVER THERE. IT WAS OVER HERE AND NOW IT'S OVER THERE.
Steve: IT'S OVER THERE.
Jimmy: GET OUT OF HERE. GET OVER HERE. GET OUT OF HERE. THAT'S RIGHT, IT TURNS OUT HILLARY'S BROTHER COULD DAMAGE HER CAMPAIGN. BUT THEN JEB BUSH WAS LIKE, "I THINK WE ALL GET A PASS ON WHO OUR BROTHERS ARE." [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST -- YOU CAN'T CHOOSE YOUR SIBLINGS. WE ALL GET A LITTLE PASS. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. [ APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, JEB BUSH GOT IN A A LITTLE TROUBLE. DID YOU SEE THIS? YESTERDAY, HE ACCIDENTALLY TOLD REPORTERS THAT HE IS IN FACT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, EVEN THOUGH HE HASN'T FORMALLY ANNOUNCED IT YET. BUT I THINK HE COVERS IT UP PRETTY WELL. TAKE A LOOK.
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN YOUR BROTHER.
I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016 AND THE FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT HOW WE -- IF I RUN, HOW DO YOU CREATE HIGH SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH.
Jimmy: REPORTERS WERE LIKE, "YOU SAID YOU'RE RUNNING." HE WAS LIKE, "NO HABLO INGLES." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, JEB BUSH ALSO GAVE A SPEECH WHILE HE WAS IN NEVADA YESTERDAY. AND I THINK THE CAMPAIGN IS ALREADY STARTING TO GET TO HIM. JUST WATCH HOW BUMMED OUT HE IS WHEN THE CROWD CORRECTS HIM ON HOW HE SAYS "NEVADA."
I'M FROM MIAMI. THIS -- YESTERDAY I LEFT IT WAS LIKE 88 DEGREES. AND I THOUGHT I WAS COMING TO NEVADA WHERE IT WAS GOING TO BE 88 DEGREES. BUT I'M IN NORTHERN NEVADA WHERE IT'S 50 DEGREES. NEVADA. NEVADA. GOT THAT OUT OF THE WAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY. DON'T WORRY, JEB. WHAT HAPPENS IN VAHGES STAYS IN VAHGES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
Steve: OH! HEY!
Jimmy: GET THIS. I READ THAT THEY'RE MAKING A A MOVIE ABOUT BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA'S FIRST DATE, CALLED "SOUTH SIDE WITH YOU." AND THE PRODUCERS SAID THEY'VE ALREADY CAST SOMEONE TO PLAY A A YOUNG BARACK OBAMA. NOW, I'M NOT SAYING THE PRESIDENT HAS AGED A LOT, BUT THAT YOUNG ACTOR IS MORGAN FREEMAN.
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
Steve: THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING HE'S HAS AGED A A LOT.
Jimmy: I'M NOT SAYING IT.
Steve: MORGAN FREEMAN?
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT THAT SURPRISING THEY'RE MAKING A MOVIE ABOUT THE OBAMAS, SINCE THEY'VE ACTUALLY BEEN STARRING IN THEIR OWN SITCOM FOR YEARS. YOU GUYS KNOW THIS SHOW, RIGHT? ♪♪ ♪ IT'S A RARE CONDITION THIS DAY AND AGE TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE ♪ ♪ LOVE AND TRADITION AND THE GRAND DESIGN SOME PEOPLE SAY IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND ♪
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. YOU GOTTA GET URKEL TO PLAY THE SECRET SERVICE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: DID I DO THAT?
Jimmy: OH, I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO NICK FRADIANI, WHO WON SEASON 14 OF "AMERICAN IDOL" LAST NIGHT. YEP. OBVIOUSLY HE WAS VERY EMOTIONAL WHEN HE WON. HE WAS LIKE, "I'M GONNA MAKE MY FANS PROUD, OR MY NAME ISN'T -- CRAP, EVEN I'VE ALREADY FORGOTTEN MY NAME. THIS IS NOT A GOOD SIGN." [ APPLAUSE ] NICK -- I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER.
Steve: FORGET ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: SOME BUSINESS NEWS. I READ THAT A HEDGE FUND BOUGHT THE RADIOSHACK BRAND FOR $26 MILLION IN A RECENT AUCTION. EVEN SNOOP DOGG WAS LIKE, "HOW HIGH WERE THEY?" [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT THIS WAS INTERESTING. THERE'S A GROWING TREND ON PINTEREST OF SOMETHING CALLED "SHE SHEDS." YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? YEAH. IT'S LIKE A WOMAN'S VERSION OF A "MAN CAVE." SHE SHEDS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: SHE SHEDS?
Jimmy: SHE SELLS SHE SHEDS DOWN BY THE SEA SHORE.
Steve: SHE SHED IN A SHED?
Jimmy: SHE SHED --
Steve: THAT'S AN OUTHOUSE.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, NO. MAN CAVES, NOW THEY HAVE SHE SHEDS. IT'S COOL, THOUGH. MOMS WILL HAVE THEIR OWN SPACE. DADS WILL HAVE THEIR OWN SPACE. AND KIDS WILL BE LIKE, "WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYBODY?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, IT WORKS OUT PERFECTLY. A GREAT FAMILY THING. AND FINALLY, THIS IS JUST A A CRAZY STORY. THIS WEEK, A MAN IN MASSACHUSETTS -- [ CHEERS ] YEAH, YEAH. GET READY, GET READY. A MAN IN MASSACHUSETTS WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AFTER HE GOT DRUNK AND CHASED A BEAR THROUGH THE WOODS WITH A HATCHET. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS IS TRUE, THE POLICE RELEASED A STATEMENT ON FACEBOOK SAYING, QUOTE, "THE NORTH ADAMS POLICE DEPARTMENT IS URGING EVERYONE TO NOT CHASE BEARS THROUGH THE WOODS WITH A A DULL HATCHET, DRUNK." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS A REAL STATEMENT FROM THE POLICE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, BEARS RELEASED THEIR OWN STATEMENT SAYING, QUOTE, "WE SAY GO FOR IT, MAN." [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

IT WAS A GREAT SHOW, BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SNOOP WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH. FOR ONE, HE REFUSED TO USE HIS OWN ARMS DURING THE FILMING OF THE SHOW. WHICH IS A FAIR REQUEST. I MEAN, CELEBRITIES HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS ON THEIR RIDERS. SOME WANT WHITE TOWELS IN THEIR DRESSING ROOMS, CANDLES, CHAMPAGNE. SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT TO SHOW THEIR ARMS.

Jimmy: DID YOU WORK AT CARVEL?
I DID. MY FIRST JOB.
Jimmy: NO WAY. DID YOU MAKE FUDGIE THE WHALES?
I WAS A SODA JERK. [ LAUGHTER ] FUDGIE THE WHALE I HATED. I DESPISED FUDGIE. BECAUSE YOU HAD TO MAKE THIS CAKE AND PUT IN A LOT OF INTRICACIES. AND YOU HAD TO WRITE, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY SYLVIA," WHICH I WOULD MISSPELL. BOTH HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND SYLVIA.
Jimmy: AND SYLVIA. YEAH, OF COURSE.
AND THEN THE BOSS WOULD GO, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
Jimmy: I LOVE THE CARVEL COMMERCIALS.
CARVEL -- BECAUSE THEY HAD THIS OLD GUY. WHAT WAS HIS FIRST NAME? FRANK?
Jimmy: TOM?
TOM CARVEL.
Jimmy: TOM CARVEL.
HE IS 112.

HE'D WHEEZE RIGHT AFTER THE BREAK.
Jimmy: WHY NOT JUST GET A A VOICE OVER GUY? HE'S LIKE, "EVERY KID SHOULD HAVE FUDGIE THE WHALE FOR THEIR BIRTHDAY." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE THE WORST VOICE. BUT I LOVE THOSE COMMERCIALS SO MUCH, AND EVERY BIRTHDAY I GOT AN ICE CREAM CAKE FROM CARVEL.
WHEN WE WORKED AT CARVEL -- IT'S SOFT ICE CREAM AND YOU TAKE IT OUT OF A MACHINE AND YOU PUT IT IN A CONE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND YOU GOT TO BUILD THE CONE LIKE THIS. BUT IF THERE WAS A WISE GUY, SOMEBODY YOU DIDN'T LIKE, WE BUILT THE CONE STRAIGHT UP, OKAY? SO NO BASE. SO WHEN THE SUN HIT IT, WHAM! RIGHT IN THE FACE. AND IT WAS LIKE OKAY, LET'S SEE HOW LONG THIS TAKES. ALL RIGHT? GREAT JOB.
Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD. VERY SMART AND VERY CLEVER OF YOU. I WANT TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS HERE, BECAUSE THE MEDIA IS ALL TALKING ABOUT THIS TOM BRADY SUSPENSION THING. I JUST WANT TO HEAR WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON IT. INFLATEGATE, DEFLATEGATE --
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WHEN YOU ARE A QUARTERBACK AND YOU PLAY IN COLD WEATHER IT'S EASY TO THROW A BALL THAT'S NOT HARD.
Jimmy: YOU PLAYED FOOTBALL DIDN'T YOU?
I PLAYED SOME FOOTBALL. AND SO, YOU KNOW, QUARTERBACKS HAVE A DIFFERENT FEEL AND BRADY LIKES HIS BALL A LITTLE BIT UNDER INFLATED. NOW WHETHER HE ORDERED IT OR NOT, WE DON'T KNOW THAT. THE NFL CAUGHT THE PATRIOTS. THEY DID IT IN A GAME AGAINST THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS, A A PLAYOFF GAME. IT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL. AND THE TWO GUYS THAT DID IT ACTUALLY PUT THE PIN IN AND TOOK THE AIR OUT, THEY'RE DONE. THEY'RE FINISHED. THEY'RE FIRED.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND BRADY'S GOT FOUR-GAME SUSPENSION, AND THE TEAM HAS TO PAY SOME MONEY AND LOSE SOME DRAFT CHOICES. IF BRADY DID IT IT'S A FAIR DEAL. HE SAYS HE DIDN'T ORDER THEM DIRECTLY, BUT I KNOW BRADY. I LIKE HIM. HE'S A SMART GUY, BUT HE PROBABLY MADE HIS PREFERENCE KNOWN. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
Jimmy: EXACTLY, YEAH. THAT'S A GREAT WAY OF PUTTING IT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I'M NOT SAYING DON'T DEFLATE IT.
YEAH, HE MADE HIS PREFERENCE KNOWN.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. HE MADE HIS PREFERENCE KNOWN. BUT SHOULDN'T THERE BE A RULE WHERE IT'S JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW, I BRING THE FOOTBALL AND IT'S MY FOOTBALL. YOU PLAY --
BUT YOU'D PLAY WITH ONE OF THOSE LITTLE MIDGET FOOTBALLS.
Jimmy: EXACTLY, ONE OF THOSE LITTLE NERF FOOTBALLS. ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
IT'S GOTTA BE RULES LIKE BASEBALL. YOU CAN'T BE PUTTING GASOLINE LIKE GAYLORD PERRY DID.
Jimmy: OH, REMEMBER GAYLORD PERRY?
YEAH, SURE.
Jimmy: HE WAS FANTASTIC.
THESE ARE TOUGH GAMES AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT STAKE IN THESE LEAGUES. SO YOU HAVE SOME RULES, YOU GOT TO OBEY THE RULES.
Jimmy: YEAH, OKAY. I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU, YOU'RE ON TOUR RIGHT NOW WITH MY MAN, DENNIS MILLER.
IS HE YOUR MAN?
Jimmy: HE'S MY MAIN DUDE. I LOVE DENNIS MILLER.
YOU KNOW, HE NEEDS LOVE. MILLER IS A LONELY, LONELY GUY. HE'S A LONELY BASTARD, ISN'T HE? NO. HE DOES NOT. WE DO THE "DON'T BE A PINHEAD" TOUR.
Jimmy: "DON'T BE A PINHEAD" TOUR. THAT'S THE NAME OF THE TOUR.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: HE'S ONE OF THE FUNNIEST DUDES OUT THERE.
HE'S VERY FUNNY, VERY QUICK. THE BEST PART OF THE SHOW IS WE TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE WRITTEN ON CARDS. SO IT'S TOTALLY AD-LIBBED AND IT'S THIS AND THAT. IT'S FAST, IT'S FUNNY, IT' FURIOUS.
Jimmy: HE HAS A QUICK MIND.
YEAH. WE SELL OUT ALMOST EVERYWHERE. WE ARE GOING TO BE IN CLEVELAND AND MEMPHIS, THOSE ARE SOLD OUT.
Jimmy: HOW FUN IS THAT? BUT WHAT DO YOU DO? DO YOU DO STAND-UP?
I JUST STAND THERE. I DON'T DO ANYTHING. I MEAN, ONCE IN AWHILE I'LL JUGGLE.
Jimmy: A MAGIC TRICK, YEAH.
NO, I TELL PEOPLE WHAT REALLY HAPPENS WHEN I INTERVIEW PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVIEW THAT YOU DON'T SEE ON TV.
Jimmy: YEAH. I GIVE THEM INSIDE BASEBALL.
Jimmy: SPEAKING OF THAT, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE RACE? WE HAVE HILLARY CLINTON IS BASICALLY -- SHE'S GOING TO GET THE NOMINATION, YOU THINK? RIGHT?
UNLESS SHE IS IN JAIL. I MEAN, THAT MIGHT INHIBIT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SHE WILL GET THE NOMINATION, YEAH.
Jimmy: SHE WILL, YEAH. AND THEN WHO DO YOU THINK IS GONNA --
OUT OF 15 GUYS --
Jimmy: IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS, RIGHT? IT'S A MESS.
IT'S A YEAR AND A HALF OUT. PRIMARIES START --
Jimmy: GOD, THEY'RE RAISING A LOT OF MONEY.
IT'S A BILLION-DOLLAR ENTERPRISE, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: A BILLION DOLLARS.
RIGHT. BUT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN MY LIFETIME. 2016. BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS SPLIT. IT'S A SPLIT THING AND WE NEED TO DECIDE, WE AS AMERICANS, WHICH DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO. DO WE WANT TO GO TRADITIONAL CAPITALISM OR DO WE WANT THIS BRAVE NEW PROGRESSIVE WORLD. AND THAT'S WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION.
Jimmy: YEAH. INTERESTING. CONGRATS ON THESE BOOKS. I MEAN, YOU'RE KNOCKING THEM OUT OF THE PARK.
YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S A A PHENOMENAL BOOK. AND I SAID, LOOK, WE GOT TWO BOOKS OUT NOW, "LEGENDS AND LIES" AND "KILLING PATTON." THE REASON THEY'RE GOOD GIFTS FOR FATHER'S DAY IS IF YOU GIVE THEM TO DAD, YOU WON'T SEE DAD FOR LIKE TWO WEEKS. IF DAD IS ANNOYING YOU, GET HIM OUT OF YOUR HAIR. GIVE DAD A TIE, HE'S NOT GOING TO WEAR IT ANYWAY AND HE'LL STILL THERE. BUT IF YOU GIVE HIM BOOKS THAT HE LIKES, HE'S GOT TO READ THE BOOKS. HE'LL DO WHAT YOU WANT.
Jimmy: YEAH, HE'LL BE OUT OF YOUR HAIR FOR A WHILE. BUT THIS IS INTERESTING. "LEGENDS AND LIES," INTERESTING SHOW. THIS IS ABOUT THE REAL WEST. THIS IS LIKE DOC HOLIDAY, YOU TALK ABOUT THE LONE RANGER IN THIS.
THIS IS FASCINATING. WE'RE DOING A TV SERIES. LIKE I'M A SHOW BIZ GUY NOW. "KILLING JESUS" THE MOVIE WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST TV MOVIE BY THE AMERICAN CRITICS ASSOCIATION.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS.
AND NOW WE HAVE A SERIES ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL, "LEGENDS AND LIES," AND IT TELLS YOU REALLY WHAT THESE PEOPLE WERE ABOUT. THE MOST FASCINATING EPISODE, WHICH HASN'T RUN YET ON FOX NEWS, IS A GUY NAMED BASS REEVES. HE'S THE REAL LONE RANGER. AND HERE'S THE KICKER. REMEMBER THE LONE RANGER?
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
SO IT WAS CLAYTON MOORE, THE WHITE ACTOR AND TONTO, JAY SILVERHEELS. OKAY. THE REAL LONE RANGER WAS BLACK. HE WAS A BLACK MAN.
Jimmy: REALLY?
A MAN NAMED BASS REEVES, AND HE'S AN ESCAPED SLAVE. AND IF YOU COULD ESCAPE INTO INDIAN TERRITORY, YOU WERE FREE. BECAUSE THE INDIANS DIDN'T RECOGNIZE SLAVERY AND THE U.S. FORCES COULDN'T GO IN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS. SO BASS REEVES ESCAPED THE PLANTATION, HE WENT INTO INDIAN TERRITORY AND HE DEVELOPED THIS UNBELIEVABLE SKILL TO TRACK DOWN BAD GUYS. BECAUSE IF YOU WERE A BANDIT, YOU WENT TO INDIAN TERRITORY TOO. YOU WERE BEYOND THE LAW. SO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HIRED HIM AS A MARSHAL, THE FIRST BLACK MARSHAL. AND HE GOT PAID, HE WAS LIKE A A BOUNTY HUNTER, TO BRING THESE GUYS BACK FROM INDIAN TERRITORY. AND HE HAD INDIAN FRIENDS. HE HAD FOUR. THERE WAS FOUR TONTOS. OKAY?
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THIS GUY WAS AN AMAZING INDIVIDUAL. NOBODY KNOWS ANY OF THIS.
Jimmy: YEAH. DID HE WEAR A MASK?
NO, HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR A A MASK. BUT WHEN THEY MADE THE TV SHOW, THEY KNEW ABOUT IT. BUT IN THE 50s AND '60s YOU COULDN'T HAVE A BLACK MAN AS A A LEAD IN A TV SHOW. SO THEY KNEW, ALL RIGHT? AMD SO THEY MADE HIM A WHITE GUY. BUT BASS REEVES WAS ONE OF THE MOST COURAGEOUS AND ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING WESTERN FIGURES. NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT HIM. WE FOUND IT AND WE TELL THE STORY.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT SO MUCH. IT'S A VERY, VERY INTERESTING BOOK. CONGRATULATIONS ON ALL THE STUFF. YOU KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK.
THANK YOU. NICE TO CONNECT.

I USED TO COACH HIM BUT NOW I COACH A BUNCH OF 12 YEARS-OLDS. I HAVE THE SNOOP YOUTH FOOTBALL LEAGUE, WHICH HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 11 YEARS. WE GOT FIVE KIDS IN THE NFL, AND OVER 50 IN DIVISION ONE. YES, SIR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?

YES, SIR.
Jimmy: AND WANTED A "COMING TO AMERICA" THEMED BIRTHDAY PARTY.
YEAH, THAT COST A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A LOT OF MONEY. THAT IS HILARIOUS. THAT IS PRETTY RAD RIGHT THERE. COME ON.
YEAH, HE WENT TO WORK.
Jimmy: HE WENT TO WORK ON THAT ONE. DID YOU SEE BEYONCE AT THE MET BALL?
NO, WHAT HAPPENED?
Jimmy: IT'S GREAT. SHE DRESSED LIKE -- WELL, SHE DRESSED LIKE THE PRINCESS FROM "COMING TO AMERICA." LOOK AT THIS SIDE-BY-SIDE.
OH BOY.
Jimmy: AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE SAW THAT BUT THAT'S GOT TO BE ON PURPOSE.
YEAH, THAT IS. THAT'S "COMING TO AMERICA" ALL OVER AGAIN.
Jimmy: I WISH JAY-Z WOULD HAVE WORN THE HAT. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIC RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM DO STUFF. I HEARD THIS STORY, I WANT YOU TO TELL ME IF THIS IS TRUE OR WHAT. MAYBE I JUST DREAMT IT. BUT I HEARD THAT YOU AND WILLIE NELSON WENT TO AMSTERDAM TOGETHER?
YES. IT WAS A --
Jimmy: HOW DID THE WORLD NOT EXPLODE? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT WAS SECRETIVE THE WAY IT HAPPENED. HE HAD A CONCERT OUT THERE ON 4/20 AND I HAD A CONCERT OUT THERE ON 4/19, WHICH IS THE ANNUAL HOLIDAY FOR WHAT WE DO. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE JUST HAPPENED TO MEET UP.
Jimmy: JUST HAPPENED TO MEET.
YEAH. THEN ONCE WE MET UP WE -- I WAS IN HIS HOTEL ROOM, WE WAS PLAYING DOMINOS AND ENJOYING LIFE.
Jimmy: SURE, SURE, SURE. YEAH, EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ] ENJOYING LIFE. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
SO AFTER ENJOYING LIFE WE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER YOU ENJOYED LIFE?
WE DEVELOPED A HUNGER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU GOT A LITTLE HUNGRY.
YEAH, SO NATURALLY WE WANTED TO GO TO KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR FAVORITE SPOTS. HIS AND MINE. SO WE PULL UP IN THE DRIVE THRU --
Jimmy: YOU AND WILLIE NELSON PULL UP IN A DRIVE THRU. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE BEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFETIME.
SO WE PULL UP AND WE ORDER THE CHICKEN. THEY GIVE IT TO US, AND WHEN THEY GIVE IT TO US THEY HAND US THE BIG BUCKET. WE TAKE THE TOP OFF AND WE BOTH PUT OUR HAND IN AT THE SAME TIME AND WE GRABBED THE SAME PIECE OF CHICKEN AT THE SAME DAMN TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT, WILLIE, THAT'S YOURS, GO AHEAD AND TAKE THAT, DOG." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW NICE YOU ARE. THAT'S A MOMENT RIGHT THERE. OH MY GOSH. YOU AND WILLIE NELSON GRABBING THE SAME PIECE OF CHICKEN. COME ON MAN, YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT UP. THIS IS A GREAT RECORD, GETTING GREAT REVIEWS. IT'S KIND OF A DIFFERENT VIBE IN THIS ONE. MORE SINGING ON THIS ONE.
YEAH, MORE OF A FUNK, MELODIC '80s OLD, SOMETHING TO THAT FEELING OF WHEN MUSIC FELT GOOD. WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO LISTEN TO RECORDS AND I WOULD JUST PUT ON AND LET THE WHOLE RECORD PLAY AND IT WOULD MAKE ME DANCE, IT WOULD MAKE ME LAUGH, IT WOULD MAKE ME SMILE. THAT'S WHAT THIS RECORD REPRESENTS. ME AND PHARRELL WANTED TO TAP INTO THAT SPIRIT.
Jimmy: I MEAN PHARRELL. YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT GUY.
HE'S HAPPY.
Jimmy: HE'S A HAPPY DUDE. HE IS HAPPY. BUT HE'S TALENTED AND HE'S JUST COOL. WHEN DID YOU FIRST START WORKING WITH HIM?
MAYBE 1998 OR '99.
Jimmy: WAS IT "DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT"?
NO, NO. IT WAS A SONG FOR HIS "NRD" ALBUM. HE HAD A PROJECT THAT HE WAS DOING AND FROM THERE WE STARTED WORKING ON ME AND HIM DOING SONGS TOGETHER TO US EVENTUALLY DOING A RECORD TOGETHER AND BRINGING IN CHARLIE WILSON AND ALL OF THE ELEMENTS.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE CHARLIE WILSON ON THIS, YOU HAVE -- YOU GOT STEVIE WONDER TO DO HARMONICA. HOW DID YOU GET STEVIE WONDER?
YOU KNOW, I GOT HIS NUMBER IN THE ROLODEX. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M A PLAYER, MAN. WHEN I REACH OUT I'M REACHING OUT WITH LOVE BECAUSE I RESPECT THE MUSICIANS WHO DID IT BEFORE ME. AND WHEN I REACH OUT IT'S ABOUT ME WANTING THE WORLD TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE AS FAR AS LIKE THE YOUNG GENERATIONS. SOME OF THE YOUNG GENERATIONS DON'T KNOW WHO THE GREAT ONES ARE. AND WHEN WE PUT THEM IN THE POSITION OF BEING ON RECORDS WITH US, WE LET THEM KNOW WHO WE GET IT FROM SO THAT WAY OUR GREAT ONES WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S TRUE. WHAT SONG ARE YOU GOING TO DO TONIGHT? DO YOU KNOW?
I'M GOING TO DO A SONG CALLED "SO MANY PROS" AND THE MUSIC WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE ROOTS, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE GET TO DO.
Jimmy: OH YEAH. I ALWAYS ASK YOU THIS, BECAUSE I HAD TO WRITE IT IN THE SKETCH, BUT HAVE YOU SEEN BOOTSY COLLINS RECENTLY?
OH MY GOD. YOU KNOW I LOVE BOOTSY AND THE BABBA. YABBA-DABBA DOO, BABY, I GOT THE MUNCHIES FOR YOUR LOVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
