[ CHEERS ] HOT CROWD TONIGHT. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. SOME BIG NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON. IT IS REPORTED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA MAY FINALLY TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO SHUT DOWN THE PRISON IN GUANTANAMO BAY. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. WHICH WILL BACKFIRE WHEN THE OLD TERRORISTS ARE LIKE, "WE'RE NOT GOING OUT THERE, THOSE NEW TERRORISTS ARE SCARY." [ LAUGHTER ] "THEY'RE CRAZY, MAN. I'M NOT MESSING WITH THOSE. I GET FOUR MEALS A DAY HERE, I GOT MY NAILS DONE. I LIKE THIS." BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA MAY CLOSE THE PRISON IN GUANTANAMO. WHEN ASKED HOW HE PLANS ON LETTING THE PRISONERS OUT, OBAMA SAID, "I'M JUST GOING TO REPLACE ALL THE GUARDS WITH SECRET SERVICE AGENTS." [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'LL JUST WANDER OUT. THEY'LL FIND THEIR WAY OUT. [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD. THIS WEEK OBAMA CRITICIZED THE GOP FOR BEING THE PARTY OF BILLIONAIRES. WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING AT A A FUNDRAISER AT A BILLIONAIRE'S HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S PRETTY EMBARRASSING. IN FACT, I DON'T SEE HOW THAT STORY COULD GET ANY WORSE. HEY COULD WE SEE THE NAME OF THE BILLIONAIE HE WAS -- RICH RICHMAN? [ LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: RICH RICHMAN IS THE GUY'S NAME? WHAT? RICH RICHMAN? THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BATMAN VILLAIN. RICH RICHMAN? COME ON. OBAMA WOULD HAVE STAYED LONGER, BUT HE WAS LATE FOR HIS LUNCH WITH DOLLARS McMONEYBAGS. HE WAS LIKE, "I GOTTA GO. I GOTTA GO." RICH RICHMAN.
Steve: RICH RICHMAN.
Jimmy: AT A FUNDRAISER YESTERDAY, GWYENTH PALTROW TOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT HE'S VERY HANDSOME, AND THAT SHE IS, QUOTE, "HIS BIGGEST FAN." THEN MICHELLE WAS LIKE, "THAT'S ENOUGH WINE FOR YOU, GOOPY." [ LAUGHTER ] GOOPY?
Steve: GOOPY.
Jimmy: BUT THE PRESIDENT IS NOT THAT POPULAR WITH EVERYONE. IN FACT, IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR JEAN SHAHEEN SAID SHE APPRECIATES THE CLINTONS' SUPPORT DURING HER CAMPAIGN, BUT BELIEVES PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD STAY AWAY. WHICH COULD ONLY MEAN JEAN SHAHEEN ISN'T TOO KEEN ON BEING SEEN WITH HEEM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

BUT HOWEVER, NEW YORK HAS RECENTLY FACED A BIT OF A A PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE IN TIMES SQUARE ALSO DRESSED AS SUPER HEROES HARRASSING TOURISTS. SO WITH THAT IN MIND, WE THOUGHT WE'D HELP YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COMIC CON ATTENDEE AND A TIMES SQUARE CHARACTER. [ LAUGHTER ] IT SHOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. FIRST, IF YOU SEE BATMAN WAITING IN LINE FOR THE BATHROOM, HE'S A COMIC CON FAN.
Steve: OH.
Jimmy: IF YOU SEE BATMAN GOING TO THE BATHROOM ON THE STREET, HE'S A TIMES SQUARE CHARACTER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DO YOU UNDERTSAND WHAT I'M SAYING? IF I GUY DRESSED AS SUPERMAN SAYS HIS WEAKNESS IS KRYPTONITE, HE'S A COMIC CON FAN. IF A GUY DRESSED AS SUPERMAN SAYS HIS WEAKNESS IS A MID-DAY BOURBON, WELL, HE IS A A TIMES SQUARE CHARACTER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: GOT MY KRYPTONITE.
Jimmy: IF THEY'RE HOLDING A A LIGHT SABER, THEY'RE A COMIC CON FAN. IF THEY'RE HOLDING A LIGHT BEER, THEY'RE A TIMES SQUARE CHARACTER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOPEFULLY THAT'LL HELP CLEAR THINGS UP SO YOU DON'T GET CONFUSED WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE.

YEAH, WHEN I'M HERE, I LOVE TO GO UP THERE AND LOOK AT THE OLD PHOTOS AND SEEING EVERYBODY. IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, SO MANY HEROES, LIKE, BILL MURRAY IS UP THERE -- PHOTOS ARE EVERYWHERE.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S SO COOL. HAVE YOU EVER MET BILL?
I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF BILL MURRAY. I HAD JUST STARTED TO DO STAND UP COMEDY. I WAS ABOUT FIVE MONTHS IN. IT WAS THIS TERRIBLE OPEN MIC. FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW, WHEN YOU START OUT, YOU DO OPEN MICS. AND IT'S LIKE, SOME PEOPLE YOU MEET, YOU'RE GONNA WORK WITH FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND THEN THERE ARE 60-YEAR-OLD MEN WHO ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THEIR MOM/ROOMMATE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I LOVE THOSE GUYS.
YEAH. SO I'M GETTING READY TO PERFORM, AND THE WAITRESS COMES DOWNSTAIRS. SHE'S LIKE "OH MY GOD, YOU GUYS, BILL MURRAY IS UPSTAIRS." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW DID SHE SAY IT AGAIN?
OH MY GOD, YOU GUYS, BILL MURRAY IS UPSTAIRS. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE WAS NOT A GOOD WAITRESS.
Jimmy: SHE WAS NOT A GOOD WAITRESS. YOU HAD TO SLOW HER DOWN.
OH MY GOD, YOU GUYS. LUCKILY SHE'S ALWAYS SUBTITLED. SO IT WAS CLEAR. SO I WAS LIKE "OH, I SHOULD GO TALK UP AND TALK TO BILL MURRAY." SO I GO UPSTAIRS, HE'S HAVING A A DRINK. I INTERRUPT HIS DRINK. I'M LIKE EXCUSE ME, MR. MURRAY I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOURS. I'M PERFORMING DOWNSTAIRS. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD COME DOWN AND WATCH ME. AND HE LOOKED AT ME WITH BILL MURRAY EYES. HE SORT OF, JUST, WAS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE WHAT HAVE I DONE, WHY HAVE I BOTHERED THIS MAN?
Jimmy: WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF HE GOES DOWN AND HE'S LIKE STOP THE SHOW? I WANT YOU FOR MY NEXT MOVIE.
YEAH, NO. IT'S LIKE I HADN'T THOUGHT THROUGH. I HAD NOT THOUGHT THAT PART THROUGH.
Jimmy: YEAH, GOOD FOR YOU FOR GOING UP TO HIM.
SO HE NICELY WAS LIKE, OKAY. THEN I WALKED DOWNSTAIRS. PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND, BILL MURRAY FOR COMEDIANS, HE'S LIKE A GOD TO COMEDIANS. I ASSUME HE'S LIKE WHAT A COW IS IN INDIA. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IF LIKE THE COW THAT IMPROVISED THE BEST PARTS OF "CADDYSHACK." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S A GOOD COMPARISON.
SO I GO DOWN STAIRS, AND I'M LIKE "WHAT HAVE I DONE? WHY HAVE I BOTHERED THIS MAN?" I'VE BEEN DOING STANDUP FOR FIVE MONTHS. I HATE MY JOKES, THERE ARE SIX PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. ONE OF THEM LIKELY MURDERED HIS MOTHER/ROOMMATE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I'M LIKE WHAT AM I WORRIED ABOUT? HE'S NOT GOING TO COME DOWNSTAIRS. AND I'M RELIEVED ABOUT THAT. AND I GET ON STAGE, AND I'M ABOUT TO START, AND ALL OF A A SUDDEN, I SEE THESE CHARCOAL PANTS WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS. AND IT'S LIKE "RUSHMORE" "GROUNDHOG DAY", "GROUNDHOG DAY", "GROUNDHOG DAY." THE FIRST HALF OF "STRIPES." AND I GET ON STAGE, AND MY IDOL, THE GUY WHO HAS INSPIRED ME TO GET INTO COMEDY IS WATCHING ME DO STAND UP AND I BOMBED. I FROZE UP. I BOMBED. I BOMBED SO HARD. I BOMBED HARDER -- HEY JIMMY, LET ME TELL YOU, I BOMBED HARDER --
Jimmy: HOW HARD DID YOU BOMB?
I BOMBED MORE THAN KANYE WEST AT A RAY-J CD RELEASE PARTY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW HARD YOU BOMBED?
JIMMY, I BOMBED HARDER THAN OSCAR PISTORIUS AT A BATHROOM DOOR CONVENTION. [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT GOOD. THAT'S MEANS IT'S REALLY BAD.
THAT'S REALLY BOMBING. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? SO I BOMBED PRETTY HARD.
Jimmy: SO BILL THEN, DID HE LEAVE?
HE WATCHED THE WHOLE SET. IT WAS HORRIBLE. I COULDN'T REMEMBER MY JOKES. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE. I GET OFF STAGE AND I GO UP TO HIM, AND I GO "THANK YOU FOR WATCHING ME." AND JUST SORT OF WAS LIKE --
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND HE LEFT. IT WAS VERY NICE OF HIM, HE GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY AND I BLEW IT. AND I THINK THAT'S A LESSON TO EVERYBODY OUT THERE. TO THE KIDS. YOU'RE OUT THERE, YOU WANT TO DO YOUR BEST. YOU TO MEET YOUR IDOL, DON'T BOTHER HIM. LET HIM HAVE A DRINK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT THE LESSON.
THAT'S NOT THE LESSON?
Jimmy: NO, THE LESSON IS YOU GET STRONGER. AND YOU GET BETTER, GET STRONGER --
NO, YOU'RE A STUPID IDIOT. AND YOU'RE TERRIBLE AT COMEDY.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS ON -- FXX, AM I SAYING IT RIGHT?
FXX. DOESN'T IT JUST ROLL RIGHT OFF THE TONGUE.
Jimmy: AM I SAYING IT WRONG? FXX.
FXX.
Jimmy: FXX.
FXX.
Jimmy: EFFECT SEX.
EFFECT SEX.
Jimmy: EFFECT SEX.
EFFECT SEX.
Jimmy: YOU CAN PROBABLY SAY THAT ON FXX, YOU CAN'T SAY IT HERE, THOUGH.
JIMMY I STEPPED OUT OF LINE SO HARD ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW."
Jimmy: NO, DON'T TELL ME HOW HARD YOU STEPPED OUT OF LINE. "THE LEAGUE" IS ABOUT A FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE, YOU AND YOUR BUDDIES. GOSH, IT'S A FUNNY FUNNY SHOW. I ALSO GOTTA SAY, YOU WERE GREAT, IF ANYONE'S EVER SEEN " KROLL SHOW" ON COMEDY CENTRAL AS WELL. REALLY GREAT SHOW.

Jimmy: SENOR FEATURE?
BECAUSE ALL HE DOES IS FEATURE ON PEOPLE'S SONGS. AND ALSO HE LOVES TO [ BLEEP ] FEET. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ON THIS -- WELL ON FXX YOU CAN.
