ANTHONY IS LOOKING DOWN ON US AND THINKING, HUH, I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE BEYONCE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU KNOW -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STILL COULD BE.

Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] 'CAUSE YOU AND BEN GOT INTO ACTING.
YEAH. I THINK, IT'S WEIRD. WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT IT NOW, WE WERE LIKE 14 AND 16 YEARS OLD. AND WE WERE COMING TO NEW YORK TO AUDITION FOR THINGS FROM BOSTON. NOBODY IN OUR FAMILY WERE IN THE BUSINESS, AND WE WERE OBSESSED WITH IT. AND FED ON EACH OTHER'S OBSESSION. THAT'S HOW WE BONDED IN OUR ADOLESCENCE. WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR 35 YEARS NOW. WE USED TO FLY TRUMP AIR TO GET TO NEW YORK. [ LAUGHTER ]

WHEN HE BOUGHT EASTERN AIRLINES. AND IT WAS LIKE TRUMP AIR. HE REDID THE INTERIORS OF THE PLANE.

NOT REALLY, NO. I GOT IN ONE FIGHT AND HURT THE OTHER KID AND I FELT SO HORRIBLE ABOUT IT. MY MOTHER, YOU KNOW, INSTANTLY TOOK ME TO HIS HOUSE, YOU KNOW, WHERE HIS MOTHER BROUGHT HIM OUT AND WE TEARFULLY APOLOGIZED. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS MY MOTHERS WAY. THAT IS NOT THE WAY YOU SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS.
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC. I HAVE A SIMILAR STORY. DO YOU REMEMBER THE KID'S NAME?

CAN'T I'M WORKING SATURDAY. [ LAUGHTER ] SUNDAY. NO I CAN'T. WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR SCHEDULES. WE PUNCHED EACH OTHER. IT WAS REALLY SILLY. I REMEMBER I RIPPED HIS CHAIN OFF AS WRESTLING AND HELPED HIM FIND HIS CHAIN AFTER WE FOUGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOKING ON THE GRASS, OH HERE IT IS. I FOUND IT MAN.
WE CAN PUNCH EACH OTHER BUT DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY IS WAY OUT OF THE THING.
Jimmy: CONGRATS BEING ON THE COVER OF "GQ." [ CHEERS ] REALLY.
THANKS.
Jimmy: IT'S A GREAT ARTICLE AS WELL. THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT STORIES ABOUT YOU HERE. THERE IS ONE I LIKE. YOU MEETING PRINCE. YOU TALKING TO PRINCE. BECAUSE PRINCE IS A MAGICAL DUDE, LEGEND. WHERE DID YOU MEET HIM AND HOW?
I MET HIM IN LONDON. WE WENT TO A SHOW. WE ACTUALLY RUINED MY -- MY OLDEST JUST TURNED 18. WHICH IS HORRIFYING.
Jimmy: UNBELIEVABLE.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: HOW'S THAT?
I KNOW, IT WAS JUST LIKE THAT. BUT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT 10. AND WE TOOK HER TO THE PRINCE CONCERT. WE ENDED UP, THE PEOPLE WITH PRINCE PUT US LITERALLY NEXT TO THE STAGE. WE COULD REACH UP AND TOUCH PRINCE. I TURNED TO MY WIFE AND I SAID, WE COMPLETELY RUINED THIS CHILD. SHE IS GOING TO GET TO COLLEGE AND HE'S GOING TO BE LIKE I HAVE CONCERT TICKETS AND SHE'LL BE LIKE, WHEN DO WE MEET PRINCE? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PLEASE, I SAW THE BEST CONCERT RIGHT UP CLOSE.
WE GOT TO GO BACK TO TALK TO HIM AFTERWARDS. HE WAS JUST AMAZING. AND HE SAID THE MOST AWESOME PRINCE THING EVER WHICH WAS, I WAS JUST CHATTING WITH HIM. AND I ASKED HIM, YOU STILL LIVE IN MINNESOTA, DON'T YOU? WE WERE IN EUROPE AT THE TIME, WE WERE IN LONDON. HE TURNS AND LOOKS ME RIGHT IN THE EYE AND GOES, I LIVE INSIDE MY OWN HEART, MATT DAMON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I LIVE INSIDE MY OWN HEART, MATT DAMON.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT PRINCE TO SAY.
AND IT'S TRUE, TOO.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO SAY, OH YEAH, I LIVE IN MINNESOTA. YOU SHOULD COME BY AND WATCH FOOTBALL.
WE'RE RIGHT OUTSIDE THE TWIN CITIES. I LIVE IN MY OWN HEART, MATT DAMON.
Jimmy: THAT IS THE GREATEST. THE DIRECTOR, PAUL GREENGRASS? THIS GUY MUST MUST BE BRILLIANT. HE'S A GENIUS.
HE'S GREAT.
Jimmy: HE WROTE THE MOVIE WITH THIS EDITOR?
CHRIS, YEAH, THE EDITOR. SO CHIRS HAD EDITED ALL FOUR FILMS THAT I'VE BEEN A PART OF. SO THEY JUST DECIDED TO GET TOGETHER AND WRITE IT. THEY TOOK ABOUT A YEAR TO WRITE IT.
Jimmy: I THINK THAT'S BRILLIANT. BECAUSE THEN THE EDITOR KNOWS WHAT SCENE. HE GOES, OH, THIS IS GOING TO WORK WITH THIS.
IT WAS THE SMARTEST WAY WE EVER MADE ONE OF THESE.
Jimmy: IT MOVES. YOU GO 90 MILES PER HOUR THE WHOLE FILM. IT DOESN'T STOP, DOESN'T SLOW DOWN. IT IS FANTASTIC.
THANKS. WE WANTED IT TO BE KIND OF A A PIECE WITH THE OTHER THREE THAT WE MADE SO THAT YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST THE NEXT CHAPTER.
Jimmy: IS THERE ANYTHING WE SHOULD SAY ABOUT THIS ONE THAT ANYONE NEEDS TO KNOW? OR IS IT BETTER NOT TO KNOW ANYTHING?
IF YOU LIKE THE OTHER ONES WE DID, HOPEFULLY YOU'LL LIKE THIS ONE, TOO UNLESS WE REALLY MESSED IT UP.
Jimmy: NO, YOU DID NOT.
BUT I DON'T THINK WE DID.
Jimmy: I DON'T' THINK YOU DID. YOU GOT A GREAT CAST. AND EVERYONE IS GOOD IN IT.
WE HAVE ALICIA VIKANDER JOINED OUR CAST WHICH WAS AMAZING. [ CHEERS ] SHE'S AWESOME, AND VINCENT CASSEL WHO'S INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: AND A GOOD VILLAN.
AND THEN WE GOT TOMMY LEE JONES. [ CHEERS ]
WHICH WAS GOOD.
Jimmy: HOW COOL IS THAT GUY?
HE'S THE BEST. YOU KNOW, TOMMY LEE GAVE ME A A JOB 20 SOMETHING YEARS AGO. THE FIRST THING THAT HE EVER DIRECTED WAS THIS LITTLE CABLE TV MOVIE. AND TOMMY LEE GAVE ME A JOB AND I WAS OUT OF MONEY AND BEN AND CASEY AND I WERE LIVING TOGETHER IN L.A. THAT PAID ME $20,000. I'LL NEVER FORGET. I GOT TO WORK WITH HIM ALL SUMMER LONG. I GOT THIS MONEY. AND THAT WAS THE MONEY THAT ALLOWED BEN AND I NOT TO HAVE TO GO GET OTHER JOBS SO WE COULD STAY AT HOME AND WRITE "GOOD WILL HUNTING." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] I'LL NEVER FORGET HIM FOR THAT. HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT, I DON'T THINK. WELL NOW HE DOES.

Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. IT RUINS THE SPORT. I THINK BESIDES ME, YOU'RE THE MOST ACCIDENT-PRONE TALK SHOW HOST OUT THERE. YOU'VE BEEN HIT BY A CAR THREE TIMES?
THREE TIMES, YES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU GOTTA WALK ME THROUGH AT LEAST ONE OF THEM, UM, PLEASE. WHAT IS -- HOW? HOW?
WELL, I WAS RIDING FROM AN AA MEETING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT EXPLAINS ONE OF THEM. YEAH.
YEAH. BACK TO MY HOUSE AND I GOT HIT. FORTUNATELY, IT WASN'T A BEER TRUCK, WHICH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO IRONIC, EVEN FOR ME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT I GOT CRUSHED ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY, A PUNCTURED LUNG. THIS ARM IS MANGLED. I CAN'T CLOSE MY LEFT HAND. THESE TWO FINGERS DON'T WORK. THEY'VE GOT NO ULNAR NERVE. THE MIDDLE ONE WORKS PERFECTLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR AIMING IT MY WAY. I APPRECIATE THAT.
I CAN STILL COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER MOTORISTS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT TOOK ME ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS TO RECOVER FROM THAT ONE, AND THEN I GOT BACK ON THE BIKE, FOR THE SECOND TIME, BACK ON THE BIKE WAS IN DEARBORN, MICHIGAN. AND I WOKE UP IN A HOSPITAL WEARING A TURBAN. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE GOT NO RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE. THEN THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO I WENT THROUGH A WINDSHIELD HERE IN NEW YORK. AND I THOUGHT, HMM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
Jimmy: I'M NOT GOING TO RIDE A BIKE ANYMORE.
YEAH, MAYBE NOT.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE END OF THAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I LOVE THE LOOSENESS AND THE FUN OF YOUR SHOW. UH, I WATCH IT ALL THE TIME. YOU INTERVIEW EVERYONE FROM JORDAN SPIETH TO GEORGE W. BUSH, WHICH WAS A A FANTASTIC INTERVIEW.
ISN'T HE WONDERFUL?
Jimmy: HE WAS SO CHARMING AND FUNNY. AND WE TALK ABOUT HIS PAINTINGS. AND I GO, I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT STUFF. IS HE A GOOD GOLFER?
UH, NO, HE'S NOT A BAD PLAYER.
Jimmy: HE IS? HE'S PRETTY GOOD?
YEAH, I MEAN, HE'S A PRETTY GOOD PLAYER. I'D SAY YOU KNOW, PROBABLY 12 HANDICAP, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: DO YOU GET NERVOUS WHEN YOU INTERVIEW THE PRESIDENT? CAUSE YOU INTERVIEWED BILL CLINTON, AS WELL.
YES, I DO. IT'S ALWAYS -- I GET NERVOUS -- I'M NERVOUS RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: ARE YOU, REALLY?
YEAH. I SOILED MYSELF BRIEFLY BEHIND STAGE.
Jimmy: I WAS WONDERING WHAT THAT WAS.
YOU GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY. NO, I THINK IF YOU'RE NOT NERVOUS,
Jimmy: WELL, I NOTICED YOU WERE SITTING TALLER THAN YOU NORMALLY WOULD BE.
I THINK IF YOU'RE NOT NERVOUS, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT PAYING ATTENTION.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. BUT I MEAN, YOU'VE HAD DONALD TRUMP. HOW WAS HE AS AN INTERVIEWEE?
HE WAS PHENOMENAL. THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE DONALD -- HE IS THE DONALD.
Jimmy: HE'S NOT A CHARACTER. THAT'S HIM.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HE'S BEEN ON THE SHOW NUMEROUS TIMES. AND I GO, NO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THAT'S WHO HE IS.
Jimmy: THAT'S ACTUALLY WHO HE IS.
YEAH, I MEAN, IF YOU ASK HIM IF THAT'S, YES, YES THAT'S WHO I AM. AND I WILL BE THE SAME PERSON TOMORROW, POSSIBLY WORSE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND YOU GOTTA LOVE HIM FOR THAT. I LIKE THE MAN.
Jimmy: YEAH, ARE YOU GOING TO INTERVIEW HILLARY CLINTON?
YOU KNOW I INTERVIEWED HER HUSBAND AND HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING ABOUT HER. SO -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: OKAY. HOW ABOUT TIGER WOODS? HAVE YOU EVER INTERVIEWED HIM?
I'M HOPING TIGER WILL BE ON THE SHOW NEXT YEAR, THE START OF NEXT YEAR. I'M NOT SURE.
Jimmy: THE SOURCE I READ, IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE IT'S THE END OF HIS CAREER.
UH, HE IS BADLY HURT. IT'S NOT A MUSCULAR OR SKELETAL THING. IT'S NERVE DAMAGE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL BE ABLE TO COME BACK. I SURE HOPE SO. WE MISS HIM OUT THERE, THE IMPACT THAT HE HAD IN THE GAME AND HOW MUCH FUN IT WAS TO WATCH HIM DURING THAT PERIOD, WHERE HE WAS JUST LIKE WATCHING A CREATURE FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET.
Jimmy: I REALLY WISH I GOT TO SEE HIM DO THAT. UH, YOU HAVE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT THAT'S KIND OF A COOL THING YOU ARE DOING FOR THE OLYMPICS. YOU'RE GOING TO BE INTERVIEWING PRESIDENT OBAMA.
YES.
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC.
YES. IT IS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT -- HOW DID HE CHOOSE YOU OUT OF ANYONE TO DO THE --? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NO, I LIKE THAT HE DID.
NO, IT'S A VERY, VERY LOGICAL QUESTION.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA. I MEAN, HE LOVES TO PLAY GOLF. AND I GUESS, YOU KNOW, THAT HE WATCHES THE SHOW. AND ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.
Jimmy: DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT?
IT WILL BE, I WANT TO SAY, NEXT WEDNESDAY, IT'S ABOUT THE 3rd. AND THEN IT WILL BE PART OF THE OPENING CEREMONY, THAT WILL BE BROADCAST.
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC. THAT'S SO GOOD.
IT REALLY IS. IT'S A GREAT HONOR.
Jimmy: WELL, I'M PSYCHED TO HAVE YOU. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP OF YOU. HERE IS THE CLIP. HERE IS DAVID FEHERTY INTERVIEWING PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE DONALD TRUMP. HIS SHOW "FEHERTY" AIRS MONDAYS AT 9:00P.M. ON THE GOLF CHANNEL. CHECK THIS OUT.
YOU KNOW THE FIRST TIME THAT I SPOKE TO YOU I ASKED YOU IF IT BOTHERED YOU THAT PEOPLE FELT THAT YOU WERE AN [ BLEEP ]? THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THINK THAT YOU'RE A WORLD CLASS [ BLEEP ][ BLEEP ].
IT'S TRUE.
YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, YOU KNOW BASED ON THE POLLS, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO MIGHT STILL THINK, YOU KNOW, THAT YOU'RE A BIT OF AN A-HOLE. BUT DOES IT BOTHER YOU? I MEAN, ARE YOU LESS [ BLEEP ] THAN YOU WERE BEFORE?
WELL I THINK I'M DOING WELL. I DID VERY WELL IN THE POLLS IN THE PRIMARIES. I LED FROM BEGINNING TO END. AND I'M DOING WELL NOW. I HAVEN'T SPENT ANY MONEY YET.
WELL I MEAN, I THINK THAT --
THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU'VE GOT 50%, YOU'RE DOING WELL. THAT MEANS 50% OF THE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE YOU.
WELL, WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE [ BLEEP ] THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO DEAL WITH, ISN'T IT PREREQUISITE THAT HE NEEDS TO BE A BIT THAT WAY HIMSELF?
MAYBE SO, MAYBE SO. IN WHICH CASE PERHAPS I'LL DO VERY WELL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
