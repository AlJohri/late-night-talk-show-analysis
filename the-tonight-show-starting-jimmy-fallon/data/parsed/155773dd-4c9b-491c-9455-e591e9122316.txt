[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHAT IF IT RAINED SNOWBALLS AND EVERYONE GOT SUN BURNED? LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS, HERE. THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER WAS ON SATURDAY. AND PRESIDENT OBAMA ENDED SPEECH BY SAYING OBAMA OUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- AND LITERALLY DROPPING THE MIC. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN HILLARY CLINTON CAUGHT THE MIC MIDAIR AND SAID, "LET'S DO THIS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Steve: WOWZER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GET THIS, DURING AN AFTER PARTY FOLLOWING THE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER, A FIGHT BROKE OUT BETWEEN REPORTERS AT FOX NEWS AND THE HUFFINGTON POST. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NO MAJOR DETAILS CAME OUT ABOUT THE FIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY WITNESSED BY CNN REPORTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] SO THEY -- OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THIS IS COOL, HERE. THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY MALIA OBAMA WILL ATTEND HARVARD UNIVERSITY, BUT THAT SHE PLANS TO TAKE A YEAR OFF BEFORE STARTING. YEAH. MALIA GOT THE IDEA AFTER SEEING HOW MUCH FUN HER DAD IS HAVING WITH HIS YEAR OFF. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SAID, I'LL DO THE SAME THING. GO GOLFING. DROPPING THE MIC. ACCORD TO NEW REPORTS, AN UNUSUALLY LARGE AMOUNT OF LEADING REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THEY DON'T WANT TO BE DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE AND WILL ACTUALLY REFUSE HIM IF HE OFFERS THEM THE POSITION. PRETTY RARE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. HERE'S WHAT SOME OF THEM HAVE SAID. JOHN KASICH SAID, "THERE'S NO CHANCE I'D TAKE THAT." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] PAUL RYAN SAID, "DEFINITELY NOT." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID, "I'LL DO IT." [ LAUGHTER ] TED CRUZ SAID, "NO WAY." MITCH McCONNELL SAID, "NOT IN A A MILLION YEARS." CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID, "YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP ASKING PEOPLE, I'M IN." [ LAUGHTER ] JEB BUSH SAID, "NOPE." RAND PAUL SAID, "HECK NO." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID, "I'VE STOOD BEHIND THAT MAN FOR THE LAST THREE MONTH LISTENING TO HIM SAY GOD KNOWS WHAT.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL OF THESE RESPONSES -- TO ALL OF THESE RESPONSES DONALD TRUMP SAID, "EVERYONE SHOULD RELAX, I'M LEANING TOWARDS A FEMALE VP." AND FINALLY CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID, "CHRISTIE CHRISTIE AT YOUR SERVICE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: CHRISTIE CHRISTIE?
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIM. WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT? TED CRUZ'S RUNNING MATE, CARLY FIORINA WAS INTRODUCING CRUZ AT A RALLY IN INDIANA YESTERDAY. I THINK SHE LEFT THE STAGE A A LITTLE EARLIER THAN SHE EXPECTED. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TED CRUZ! ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SHE'S FINE, SHE'S FINE.
Steve: WHOA! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HEY! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SHE'S FINE, SHE'S FINE. ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THAT MARKS THE SECOND TIME SHE'S DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY! HO!
Jimmy: FORGET RUNNING MATE, SHE'S NOT EVEN A GOOD STANDING MATE. I KNOW I'LL FORGET THAT JOKE. AND CRUZ, CRUZ HIMSELF HAS HAD A TOUGH TIME IN INDIANA. EVEN LITTLE KIDS ARE STARTING TO HECKLE HIM AT HIS CAMPAIGN EVENTS. THIS IS REAL. THIS IS FROM YESTERDAY. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

IN FACT, WALGREENS JUST PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE POSSIBLE HEALTH BENEFITS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA. WHILE CVS SAID IT'S EXCITED JUST TO WATCH STONERS TRY TO USE THE SELF-CHECKOUT MACHINES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF WEED, I READ THAT WOODY HARRELSON'S APPLICATION TO OPEN A MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARY IN HAWAII WAS DENIED. WHEN ASKED WHY THEY DENIED THE APPLICATION, OFFICIALS SAID BECAUSE IT WAS WRITTEN ON A A DORITOS BAG WITH A SHARPIE. THAT'S WHY IT WAS DENIED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, THIS IS ANOTHER REAL THING. THERE WAS SOME RAIN IN BOSTON YESTERDAY, WHICH MEANT THE YANKEES HAD TO MAKE SURE THEIR BATS DIDN'T GET TOO WET IN THEIR GAME AGAINST THE RED SOX. AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, A-ROD HAS A VERY INTERESTING WAY OF DRYING HIS BAT OFF. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
PITCH DOWN AND IN FOR BALL ONE.

I BOUGHT THIS IN THE AIRPORT.
Jimmy: NEW AUTHOR.
THIS IS JANE AUSTEN. "PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."
Jimmy: "PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."
YOU CAN GET IT AT ANY AIRPORT. OR ANY JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY. NO, I'M READING IT ON THE SUBWAY AND EVERYTHING. SAMANTHA BEE'S SHOW IS REALLY GOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NETWORK IS. BUT SHE'S LIKE THE FUNNIEST PERSON. I KNOW SHE'S YOUR COMPETITOR AND YOU'RE VERY FUNNY --
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
BUT YOU DON'T NEED ANY HELP.
Jimmy: I DO FINE.
YOU'RE LIKE THE KING OF THE PLANET. SO I WANT TO PLUG JANE AUSTEN AND SAMANTHA BEE.
Jimmy: SAMANTHA BEE, IS A A GOOD SHOW. AND JANE AUSTEN, IS A DECENT AUTHOR. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S GOOD TO PLUG SOMEBODY. YEAH, THEY NEED A BIG BREAK. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN LOUIS C.K. LIVE, YOU SHOULD GO SEE IT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL NEVER FORGET. HE'S FANTASTIC, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU THIS SUMMER. TEN EPISODES OF "HORACE AND PETE" ARE AVAILABLE ON LOUISCK.NET. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DON'T GO ANYWHERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH OUR VERY OWN QUESTLOVE, EVERYBODY. LOUIS C.K.! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST IS A A FIVE-TIME GRAMMY-AWARD WINNING ARTIST AND FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE ROOTS. HE'S ALSO A BEST-SELLING AUTHOR. HIS LATEST BOOK, "SOMETHING TO FOOD ABOUT" IS AVAILABLE NOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE GIVE IT UP FOR QUESTLOVE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'M SITTING ON THIS CHAIR.
Jimmy: YEAH, EVER. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS, MAN.
I HAVE NIGHTMARES ABOUT THIS CHAIR.
Jimmy: HOW CAN YOU BE NERVOUS, YOU'RE ON THE SHOW EVERY NIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, JIMMY, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THE LAST TIME I DID SOMETHING ON THIS SHOW THAT WAS NON-MUSIC, NON-COOKING RELATED, I HAD ANXIETY. LIKE, YOU WANTED ME TO PLAY A A GAME LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE GAMES THAT WE DO ON THE SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
MY TEETH FELL OUT THE NIGHT BEFORE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOUR TOOTH FELL OUT?
ONE AND A HALF TOOTH FELL OUT. LIKE A CHIP -- PART OF IT CHIPPED IN THE FRONT AND THEN IT COMPLETELY -- IT WAS ANXIETY.
Jimmy: BECAUSE YOU WERE GRINDING YOUR TEETH?
I MEAN, YOU'RE KIND OF COMPETITIVE ON THESE GAMES THAT WE PLAY ON THE SHOW.
Jimmy: I DID NOT MAKE YOU NERVOUS BECAUSE I'M COMPETITIVE.
I MEAN, I DIDN'T WANT TO MESS UP. AND THE THING WAS, I SCHEDULED THIS EMERGENCY -- THIS DINNER SET FOR THIS GUY THAT DID AN OPERATION ON ME AT LIKE 1:30 IN THE MORNING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU GOT TO CHANGE DENTISTS, MAN. THIS IS LIKE --
NO, NO, NO, HE'S LIKE A A 24-HOUR DENTIST. LIKE LAUREN RECOMMENDED HIM. LIKE HE DOES LENNY, JUSTIN, YOUR PHOTO'S ON THE WALL. I THINK YOU WENT TO THIS GUY. ANYWAY, SO I DID THIS OPERATION, YOU KNOW, OUT OF ANXIETY, FOR COMING ON THE SHOW, PLAYING ON THE SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND ACCIDENTALLY, WHEN THEY GASSED ME UP, I WANTED TO LISTEN TO PINK FLOYD'S "DARK SIDE OF THE MOON" ALBUM.
Jimmy: WHY?
WELL SOMEONE TOLD ME YOU HAVEN'T HEARD IT UNTIL YOU ARE IN ANOTHER MIND STATE.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
SO THE THING WAS, I PUT IT ON MY Ipod, BUT THE PROBLEM WAS THAT I GUESS WHEN I PUT IT IN MY POCKET, I LEFT TRACK TWO ON REPEAT WHEN THE GUY'S LIKE LAUGHING AT YOU. SO FOR TWO HOURS I'M SUPPOSED TO BE COMATOSE WHILE THEY'RE OPERATING ON ME AND YOU HEAR THEM SAWING, BUT YOU JUST HEAR THIS GUY, "MWUAHAHAHA" FOR TWO HOURS STRAIGHT.
Jimmy: WELL, I'M HAPPY THAT YOU'RE SANE.
SO I'M JUST GLAD -- I JUST WANT TO ANNOUNCE THAT ALL MY TEETH ARE IN NOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, THEY'RE IN AND YOU'RE HERE. YOU HAVE A GREAT BOOK OUT.
YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE. YOU'RE NEVER ON THIS SIDE, I'M SO PSYCHED. AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU, YOU DID GET A STANDING OVATION COMING OUT SO THAT'S KIND OF A A COOL THING. BUT -- YOU'VE DONE SO MANY THINGS ON THE SHOW WITH THE BAND AND WITH US. BUT ONE THING THAT JUST STICKS IN MY MIND, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THIS, BUT YOU DID AN ACTUAL SPIT TAKE ON THE SHOW. ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN.
I CALL IT I WAS CHOKING. AND THEN YA'LL JUST PUT THE CAMERA ON ME AT THAT MOMENT WHEN I WAS CHOKING.
Jimmy: I HAVE A CLIP OF IT IF YOU DON'T MIND.
SURE, GO AHEAD JIMMY, GO ON, GO ON.
Jimmy: HERE'S QUESTLOVE DOING A SPIT TAKE ON OUR SHOW. HERE YOU GO, CHECK THIS OUT.
QUEST GAVE US A SHOUT-OUT THAT DAY.
YEAH, THAT WAS AWESOME. [ COUGHING ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: STOP STOP, STOP, STOP YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT, NO BIG DEAL.
THAT'S LIKE "GHOSTBUSTERS" SLIME. THAT WAS SLIME.
Jimmy: IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THE SHOW HAD TO BREAK DOWN FOR TEN MINUTES AS WE WERE ALL LAUGHING SO HARD.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT I GOT TO SAY YOU ARE ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING GUYS EVER. WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH, YOU KNOW. YOU AND THE GUYS ARE JUST THE COOLEST. WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS TOGETHER FOR, WHAT, LIKE SEVEN YEARS NOW?
SIX, SEVEN YEARS, YEAH.
Jimmy: SIX, SEVEN YEARS. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST ASKED YOU TO BE THE BAND?
I REMEMBER. OUR BUDDY, NEAL BRENNAN, FORMERLY OF "THE CHAPPELLE SHOW" --
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
--RECOMMENDED THAT THE ROOTS COULD MAYBE GIVE YOU SOME MUSICIANS THAT COULD TAKE THE JOB.
Jimmy: YEAH, I SAID, "WHO COULD BE THE BAND? THE BAND IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT ON THE SHOW." AND HE GOES, "OH, YOU SHOULD ASK THE ROOTS." AND I GO, "DO YOU THINK THE ROOTS WILL DO IT?" AND HE GOES, "NO."
NO.
Jimmy: THE ROOTS AREN'T GOING TO DO IT, BUT THEY MIGHT KNOW SOMEBODY THAT WILL DO IT. THEY'RE VERY NICE, TOO SO I GO -- THEN I GO, "OH, I MIGHT AS WELL JUST ASK."
I GOT TO ADMIT TO YOU, BY THAT POINT, WE WERE IN OUR 15th OR 16th YEAR OF PERFORMING. WE JUST REALLY GOT TO A A COMFORTABLE PLACE.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
AND SO, YOU KNOW, THE THOUGHT OF JUST TURNING OUR BACK ON THAT FOR, LIKE, SOMETHING UNCERTAIN WAS, LIKE, WE WERE LIKE, NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT. BUT WE JUST WANTED TO, SAVE FACE AND, YOU KNOW, GET IN GOOD WITH YOU. BUT THEN -- BUT WAIT, BUT WAIT, HERE'S THE THING THOUGH. HERE'S THE THING THOUGH. AFTER THE SHOW WAS OVER, THIS IS UCLA'S CAMPUS ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD.
Jimmy: I SHOWED UP AT THAT ONE, IT WAS AMAZING.
I WAS BACK STAGE DOING AN INTERVIEW. AND THEN WHEN I WALKED OUT MY DRESSING ROOM, YOU HAD SOMEHOW MANAGED TO CONVINCE THOSE GUYS OVER THERE TO GET IN THAT "EIGHT IS ENOUGH" HUMAN PYRAMID. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MAYBE THE REFERENCE IS TOO OLD FOR THEM OUT THERE.
Jimmy: NO I REMEMBER KIRK, I REMEMBER KIRK, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH, NO, BUT EVEN TARIQ -- EVERYTHING THAT TARIQ WEARS IS LIKE $9,000.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
SO WITH THAT -- I'M CERTAIN THAT SHIRT COSTS AT LEAST $10,000.
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW.
BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT FOR THE FACT THAT TARIQ WAS ON THE BOTTOM ROW OF THIS HUMAN PYRAMID ON UCLA GROUNDS.
Jimmy: ALL ON TOP OF EACH OTHER LIKE A CHEERLEADER PYRAMID.
RIGHT, I SAID TO MY MANAGER, WE'RE NOT GETTING RID OF THIS GUY, ARE WE? [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHEN I KNEW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO HANG OUT.
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW.
Jimmy: TALK TO ME ABOUT YOUR INTEREST IN CHEFS AND FOOD IN GENERAL AND THE IDEA OF IT.
WELL, I GUESS IN SHORT WHEN WE CAME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ANY OF US HAVE EVER HAD NORMALCY, LIKE, BEING IN ONE PLACE AT ONE TIME. LIKE WE WERE DOING 200 DAYS OUT OF THE YEAR --
Jimmy: OH REALLY?
LIVING LIKE NOMADS. YEAH, JUST LIVING LIKE NOMADS AND GYPSIES AND WHATNOT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO THE FIRST GROUP OF PEOPLE I STARTED HANGING WITH WHEN WE GOT THIS GIG WAS COMEDIANS AND CHEFS. AND I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, I WAS MORE CURIOUS AT THE CREATIVE PROCESS. LIKE, WHENEVER I TALKED TO MUSICIANS, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE MUSIC, I CARE ABOUT HOW THEY MADE IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I WANTED TO SORT OF OBSERVE THE SAME THING WITH CHEFS.
Jimmy: AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE BEST CHEFS AND LIKE SO INTERESTING. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FOUND THIS LIST OR MADE THIS LIST OF PEOPLE, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WENT TO JAPAN TO --
YEAH, STARTED GOING TO JIRO. I SAW "JIRO DEAMS OF SUSHI," THIS DOCUMENTARY OF THIS CHEF, WHO IS PROBABLY THE LORD JESUS CHRIST OF -- YOU GO TO A A PILGRIMAGE WHEN YOU GO TO HIM. YOU JUST DON'T GO TO HIS RESTAURANT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT'S IN A A SUBWAY IN JAPAN.
Jimmy: HOW WAS IT?
IT WAS AMAZING. IT WAS LIKE -- IT'S LIKE CONFESSIONAL. LIKE YOU GO SEE A PRIEST, LIKE YOU'RE THERE ALONE, HE'S THERE, WATCHING YOU, EAT HIS FOOD.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY INTIMIDATING, YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S WHEN I SORT OF NOTICED THE PARALLELS BETWEEN MUSICIANS AND CHEFS. EVEN HE REFERRED TO HIMSELF AS AN ARTIST, NOT A CHEF. SO THUS --
Jimmy: THESE PEOPLE YOU TALK TO IN THIS BOOK, DANIEL HUMM
DANIEL HUMM, DANIEL PATTERSON.
Jimmy: BUT YOU ASKED THEM GREAT QUESTIONS OF HOW THEY GOT TO THIS STAGE. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GOT YOUR INTERVIEW SKILLS FROM BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] REALLY WELL DONE. GREAT QUESTIONS. AND GREAT PICTURES BY THE WAY, TOO. AND YOU JUST SEE HOW CREATIVE AND TRICKY THESE CHEFS ARE AND HOW MUCH LOVE THEY PUT IN. I THINK THAT'S THE ONE THING YOU CAN TELL FROM ANY OF THESE STORIES IS THAT THEY ALL HAVE A A PASSION FOR THIS.
IT'S THE STUDY OF THE PASSION PROCESS. IT'S NOT ABOUT -- IT'S NOT A A COOKBOOK, IT'S NOT ABOUT FOOD, BUT IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT THE COMMITMENT AND THE PASSION THAT THEY PUT INTO THEIR CRAFT. THAT'S WHAT I ADMIRE ABOUT THEM.
Jimmy: DUDE, I ALWAYS LOVE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING NEW COMING OUT. CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS GUY, TOO. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, BUDDY.
THANK YOU, MAN.
Jimmy: I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WHAT'S IN THIS?
Jimmy: IT'S JUST WATER.
