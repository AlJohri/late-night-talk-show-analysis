Questlove: 319, IOWA CITY!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S A FANTASTIC CROWD RIGHT THERE! A GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, GUYS. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. THIS IS THE SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE NEED YOU. WE'RE HERE TOGETHER. WE'RE DOING THIS. OH, MY GOSH. GUYS, I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. YOU CAN TELL THINGS ARE GONNA GET CRAZY. YOU CAN TELL THINGS ARE GONNA GET CRAZY 'CAUSE CHRIS CHRISTIE SHOWED UP IN ONE OF MILEY CYRUS' OUTFITS FROM THE VMAs LAST NIGHT. AND YOU KNOW THAT'S -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, LAST NIGHT WAS THE VMAs OVER ON MTV. AND AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM MILEY, THERE WAS QUITE A FEW CONTROVERSIAL MOMENTS. IN FACT, TOWARDS THE END OF THE NIGHT, MILEY ACTUALLY LET A A CURTAIN SLIP TO EXPOSE HER BREAST ON LIVE TV. MILEY IMMEDIATELY APOLOGIZED TO HER OTHER BREAST. SHE GOES, "NEXT YEAR -- NEXT YEAR'S YOUR YEAR. THIS YEAR IS YOUR YEAR." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] VERY NICE. THE OTHER BIG STORY WAS THAT TAYLOR SWIFT PRESENTED KANYE WEST WITH THE MICHAEL JACKSON VIDEO VANGUARD AWARD. THERE WAS LITTLE BIT OF A TENSE MOMENT WHEN KANYE WEST TOOK THE MIC AND SAID THE AWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO KANYE WEST. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S YOU, DON'T START THIS. [ APPLAUSE ] DID YOU SEE IT THOUGH? HE GAVE -- PEOPLE THINK KANYE GAVE A A PRETTY LONG SPEECH WHEN HE GOT HIS AWARD. TO BE FAIR HE DID KIND OF TALK ABOUT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STUFF FOR 12 MINUTES OR SOMETHING. I DIDN'T REALLY -- BUT ONE THING HE SAID SORT OF EXPLAINED WHY.
Y'ALL MIGHT BE THINKING RIGHT NOW, I WONDER, DID HE SMOKE SOMETHING BEFORE HE CAME OUT HERE? THE ANSWER IS YES. I ROLLED UP A LITTLE SOMETHIN'. I KNOCKED THE EDGE OFF. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE CROWD WAS LIKE, "WE WEREN'T WONDERING ABOUT THAT AT ALL. WE KNEW THAT -- NO ONE IS WONDERING THAT." WHO GETS ANGRIER AFTER THEY SMOKE POT. HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I DID! [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS GREAT! I TOOK A COUPLE HITS OF IT, OKAY?" [ LAUGHTER ] CALM DOWN.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: AND DID YOU SEE AT THE END OF THE SPEECH, KANYE WEST ANNOUNCED HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020. [ CHEERS ] THAT'S RIGHT, HE ANNOUNCED HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AFTER SMOKING A BUNCH OF WEED. THEN OBAMA WAS LIKE, "BEEN THERE!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, KANYE WEST ANNOUNCED HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, WHEN ASKED HOW SHE WOULD FEEL ABOUT BEING THE FIRST LADY, KIM KARDASHIAN WAS LIKE, "I'M GONNA BE EVE?" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ACTUALLY, IT MIGHT BE MORE SERIOUS THAN WE THINK BECAUSE ALREADY KANYE HAS SOME SLOGANS LINED UP. CHECK THIS OUT. FIRST THERE'S KANYE 2020: YES WE KANYE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN THERE'S, KANYE FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE ALREADY THINKS HE IS. AND FINALLY THERE'S KANYE 2 2020, YOU CAN'T SPELL AMERIKANYE WITHOUT KANYE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU CAN'T SPELL AMERIKANYE --
Steve: KANYE.
Jimmy: LET'S GET TO SOME SERIOUS CANDIDATES WHO ARE ACTUALLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT LIKE DONALD TRUMP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TRUMP IS DOING PRETTY WELL IN THE POLLS RIGHT NOW. HE'S PRETTY CONFIDENT, WHICH MAY EVEN BE WHY HE SAYS HE DOESN'T PLAN ON RUNNING CAMPAIGN ADS THAT ATTACK THE OTHER CANDIDATES. NO. WHEN ASKED WHO THE ADS WOULD ATTACK INSTEAD HE SAID, "THEIR MOTHERS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S THEIR FAULT THOSE LOSERS ARE HERE ANYWAY." I READ THERE WERE A LOT OF NEWSPAPERS IN EUROPE HAVE BEEN CRITICIZING DONALD TRUMP AS AN EMBODIMENT OF WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE ABOUT AMERICANS. YEAH, IN FACT, NEWSPAPERS ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE BEEN COVERING TRUMP IN DIFFERENT WAYS. IT'S PRETTY FASCINATING. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE HEADLINES HERE. THIS FIRST HEADLINE IS FROM GREECE. IT TRANSLATES TO, AMERICA MAY ELECT A GUY WHO'S BEEN BANKRUPT MORE TIMES THAN US. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WOW. THEN THERE'S THIS HEADLINE FROM JAPAN, TRANSLATES TO, GIANT HAIR MONSTER ATTACKS WASHINGTON, D.C. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: REALLY? GOODNESS. THAT'S WHAT IT SAID?
Jimmy: ACCORDING TO A -- ACCORDING TO A NEW POLL, HILLARY CLINTON HAS LOST A A THIRD OF HER SUPPORTERS IN IOWA SINCE MAY. YEAH. WHILE THERE'S STILL DEBATE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SHE LOST THEM OR JUST DELETED THEM FROM HER DATABASE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY JUST DON'T KNOW. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU NEVER KNOW. YOU NEVER KNOW WITH HER. AND DESPITE POLLING AT ZERO PERCENT -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CURRENTLY POLLING AT ZERO PERCENT, LINCOLN CHAFEE JUST SPOKE AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE SUMMER WEEKEND ALONGSIDE HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS. BUT CHAFFEY'S HAVING TROUBLE GAINING SUPPORT, BUT I THINK HE'S HAVING EVEN MORE TROUBLE WITH HIS MICROPHONE. LOOK AT THIS.
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT THE IRAN DEAL AND WHAT A -- HOW WE STOPPED IRAN FROM ACQUIRING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I DO BELIEVE THAT, BECAUSE WE ARE RIGHT AND WE WORKED HARD FOR THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT THAT PASSED. IT WASN'T EASY. I PUT IT IN MY INAUGURAL ADDRESS. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR PEOPLE THAT LOVE EACH OTHER, OBVIOUSLY.
Jimmy: WHY IS HE HITTING THE MICROPHONE? WHY IS HE HITTING? IT'S THE ONLY THING LISTENING TO HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S YOUR BUDDY. THAT'S THE ONLY THING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS MADE ME LAUGH HERE. USAIN BOLT WON THE 200 METER SPRINT AT THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS LAST WEEK. HE'S AMAZING, RIGHT? BUT THERE WAS A BIT OF A MISHAP AFTER HE FINISHED THE RACE. TAKE A LOOK. AND THEN AFTER THE MISHAP, LISTEN TO WHAT THE ANNOUNCER FROM THE ITALIAN BROADCAST SAYS RIGHT AT THE END. [ SPEAKING ITALIAN ]
MAMA MIA!
Jimmy: DID YOU GUYS HEAR THAT? I KNOW THIS -- AND EVERYONE'S OKAY, BUT CAN YOU JUST PLAY THAT AGAIN. LISTEN TO THIS. [ SPEAKING ITALIAN ]
MAMA MIA!
Jimmy: MAMA MIA! THEY ACTUALLY SAY THAT IN ITALY? THAT'S NOT TRUE, RIGHT?

Jimmy: YEAH.
ANYBODY. I MEAN FIVE AND A HALF MONTHS PEOPLE IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA WILL VOTE. BUT IT'S A LONG WAY AWAY. SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THAT'S WHAT CAMPAIGNS ARE ALL ABOUT. CAMPAIGNS ARE TO GO AND CONVINCE PEOPLE. SO, I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT DONALD OR ANYBODY ELSE. I'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT ME. I'VE GOT TO BE MYSELF, I GOTTA DO WHAT I DO. AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
Jimmy: NOW ARE YOU ENJOYING GOING AROUND TO DIFFERENT TOWNS?

Jimmy: -- WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE ASKING YOU WHEN YOU GO TO THESE TOWN?
THEY ASK ME A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT ISIS. THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT TERRORISM. PEOPLE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT TERRORISM. A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT STUDENT DEBT. A LOT OF FAMILIES ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MUCH DEBT THEIR KIDS ARE TAKING ON FROM COLLEGE.
Jimmy: COLLEGE?
COLLEGE, YEP. AND IT'S A BIG PROBLEM AROUND THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT IT, COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT THEIR KIDS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING A JOB. SO, THEY HAVE ALL THIS DEBT. THEN THEY TRY TO GET A JOB, THEY CAN'T GET A JOB. THEY'RE SLEEPING IN THEIR PARENTS', YOU K THEY'VE GOT HUGE DEB CAN'T FIND A JOB. PARENTS ARE REALLY CONCERNED A SO WE GET ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT.
Jimmy: IT'S MY FIRST YEAR AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW" AND I'M ALMOST DONE PAYING OFF MY DEBTS. SO, I'M VERY EXCITED, YEAH, YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SO, THE NEXT BIG THING IS SEPTEMBER 16th.

Jimmy: THE LAST DEBATE, I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO TALK, AND I WAS SITTING THERE --
ME, TOO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT IT TOOK A WHILE, RIGHT?
WELL, THERE WAS ONE POINT WHERE I WENT TWENTY QUESTIONS IN A ROW WITHOUT BEING ASKED A A QUESTION. AND THAT'S HARD.
Jimmy: BUT DID YOU --
I'M STANDING UP THERE STANDING NEXT TO MARCO RUBIO AND WE'RE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND GOING, "ARE WE STILL HERE?"
Jimmy: BUT THEN --
"ARE WE STILL ON?" "DO OUR MICS WORK?"
Jimmy: BUT CHRIS CHRISTIE, DON'T YOU GO, "HEY, HEY!" AND JUMP OUT AND GO -- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT HIGH, MORE OF A DEEPER VOICE.
HEY, HEY!
Jimmy: AND YOU JUMP IN THERE AND GO, "WELL, I --" AND YOU START YELLING AT PEOPLE? AND YOU GO, "I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT!"
WHAT DO YOU THINK, I'M MORTON DOWNEY JR.? WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING HERE?
Jimmy: NO, BUT I DON'T THINK OF YOU LIKE THAT. BUT I THINK YOU JUMP IN. ARE YOU ALLOWED TO JUMP IN?
WELL, NO, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO. BUT A FEW PEOPLE DID.
Jimmy: I KNOW.

Jimmy: YEAH. I THINK THAT, TOO, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF BROS WOULD SAY "THAT'S A BRO PAS." [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE. SO IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE. MAYBE IT'S WHEN TWO BROS MAKE A A MISTAKE AND A THIRD OUTSIDE PARTY CALLS IT A BRO PAS. LIKE SOMEONE FROM --

Jimmy: YOU THINK? YEAH, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
