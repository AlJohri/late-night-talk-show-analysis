THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. IT'S A HOT SHOW TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS PRETTY BIG. THE PENTAGON HAD TO SHUT DOWN SOME OF ITS TWITTER ACCOUNTS YESTERDAY, BECAUSE IT WAS HACKED BY ISIS. YEAH. OR MORE LIKELY SOMEONE AT THE PENTAGON TWEETED A PICTURE OF THEIR JUNK AND NOW THEY'RE BLAMING ISIS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE GOT HACKED PRETTY BAD. MORE TROUBLE FOR OBAMA. MANY REPUBLICANS ARE CRITICIZING THE PRESIDENT FOR STAYING AT THE WHITE HOUSE INSTEAD OF JOINING THE OTHER 40 WORLD LEADERS AT THE ANTI-TERROR MARCH IN PARIS ON SUNDAY. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY FRENCH PEOPLE ARE NOW REFERRING TO AMERICAN CHEESE AS FREEDOM CHEESE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S NOT THE NAME OF IT. IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP ANYTHING. AND AFTER DAYS AFTER MITT ROMNEY ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS CONSIDERING A 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, HIS FORMER RUNNING MATE, PAUL RYAN, ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT HE WILL NOT RUN. RYAN SAID HE WON'T SAY WHO HE'LL SUPPORT, HE JUST WANTS THE BEST MAN FOR THE JEB -- JOB. [ LAUGHTER ] BEST MAN FOR THE JOB. WHAT DID I SAY? YES, JOB. [ LAUGHTER ] SORRY ABOUT THAT.
Steve: I'M BUSHED.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] TIRED, TIRED. I'M TIRED. I'M TIRED. NOT BUSHED. THIS ISN'T GOOD.

[ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS THOUGH, I HEARD THAT 15 STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE GAS PRICES THAT HAVE DIPPED BELOW $2.

Jimmy: THAT WAS A NEW THING --
LIKE JAGER BOMBS HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND FOR 20 YEARS. YEARS, LIKE 10 YEARS AGO, THAT'S WHEN THE JAGER BOMBS --
Jimmy: TEN YEARS AGO, OH MY GOSH.
THAT'S FUN TALKING ABOUT.
Jimmy: IT WAS SO MUCH FUN, GOSH, GOSH, GOSH PLEASE. AND NOW I SEE YOUR BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BABY GIRL BACK THERE. WE BOTH HAVE BABIES NOW AND KIDS BUT SHE IS --
YOU'VE GOT A TINY ONE.

Jimmy: SO -- GOSH, SHE'S ADORABLE, LITTLE MARLOWE. SHE GAVE ME FIVE AND SHE HAD CRACKERS -- SHE HAD A CRACKER IN AND WAS LIKE, "HI." AND LIKE SMASHED THE CRACKER.
THE WHOLE DRESSING ROOM IS LIKE COVERED IN CRACKERS AND CHEESE.

AND I'M PREGNANT. AND EVERY MORNING HE WAS LIKE, "MORNING FATTY." [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S LIKE -- THERE'S NOTHING LIKE CLINT EASTWOOD CALLING YOU FAT.
Jimmy: HE'S SUCH A GOOD GUY. BUT THIS ONE WAS LIKE -- MAN I -- THE OPENING SCENE OF YOU IN THIS FILM, IT REMINDED ME OF "TOP GUN," WHERE TOM CRUISE AND KELLY McGILLIS, WHERE HE GOES UP TO HER AND THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO SING, "YOU LOST THAT LOVIN' FEELING."
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S YOUR FIRST APPEARANCE OF YOU AND I'M LIKE, OH, THAT'S SIENNA RIGHT THERE." AND JUST -- I TOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOU FOR A SECOND. SO GOOD, CHARMING AND COOL, AND I JUST -- AND THIS IS A REAL PERSON YOU'RE PLAYING?

AND WE STARTED LAUGHING, MAN, HE JUST -- IT'S JUST AN INTENSE FILM, AND THIS GUY, THE SNIPERS OUT THERE, THIS CHARACTER PLAYED CHRIS, SHOT IT WAS BETWEEN 140 AND 150 --
I THINK 160 CONFIRMED KILLS OR SOMETHING. IT'S AN INSANE AMOUNT AND YOU KNOW, IT'S A REALLY, IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE REALLY STRUGGLED WITH, I THINK HE WOULD BE HAPPIER WITH THE NUMBER OF LIVES HE SAVED, VERSUS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT HE KILLED BUT HE WAS A A REALLY PROLIFIC SNIPER AND YOU KNOW, STRUGGLED OF BEING A A NAVY SEAL AND TRYING TO BALANCE THE HOME LIFE, AND IT SEEMED LIKE WHEN HE WAS AT HOME, THERE WERE PEOPLE DYING THAT HE COULD HAVE SAVED. AND SO -- YOU GOT TO SEE IT, IT'S INTENSE, IT'S BEAUTIFULLY SHOT. AND YOU JUST KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK AGAIN. I WANT TO SHOW YOU A CLIP.
