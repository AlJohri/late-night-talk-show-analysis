Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M -- OH, I FEEL THE LOVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE PART OF THE SHOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU SO MUCH. GONNA BE A FUN SHOW TONIGHT. LOT OF -- A COUPLE SURPRISES, SOME GOOD STUFF TONIGHT. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS FIRST. DID YOU SEE THIS? IN A RECENT INTERVIEW WITH "GQ" MAGAZINE, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT HE'D LIKE TO OWN AN NBA TEAM AFTER HE LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE. I MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA KNOW IT'S OBAMA'S TEAM WHEN IT TAKES THE PLAYERS FIVE YEARS TO PASS SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S OBAMA'S TEAM. THEY DON'T PASS ANYTHING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THANKS, OBAMA.
Jimmy: I ALSO SAW IN A NEW INTERVIEW, TOM BRADY SAID THAT HE'LL NEVER GET INTO POLITICS BECAUSE, QUOTE, "HALF THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LIKE YOU AND HALF THE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] OR AS THAT'S ALSO KNOWN, SPORTS. ONE TEAM, YOU GOT ANOTHER TEAM. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, THE BIG POLITICAL NEWS THIS WEEK IS THAT LOUISIANA GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT. NOW, WE'VE HAD HIM ON THE SHOW BEFORE. HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT, LIVE VIA SATELLITE, IS LOUISIANA GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL. WELCOME BACK, BOBBY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WOW! ARE YOU SERIOUS? THIS IS CRAZY! I'VE NEVER BEEN INVITED BACK TO A TV SHOW BEFORE. USUALLY IT'S, "SEE YOU, BOBBY, HAVE A NICE LIFE."
Jimmy: WELL, WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU BACK. I HAVE TO ASK, WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO END YOUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN?
NOW, JIMMY, FOR THE RECORD, I'M NOT ENDING MY CAMPAIGN. I'M JUST SUSPENDING IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SUSPENDING IT. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
WELL, YOU REMEMBER WHEN JABBA THE HUTT LOWERED HAN SOLO INTO THAT VAT AND HE CAME OUT LOOKIN' LIKE HE WAS STUCK INSIDE A GIANT METAL CANDY BAR? AND THEN YEARS LATER THEY THAWED HIM OUT AND HE WAS LIKE, "WHOA, WHAT HAVE I MISSED?" THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY CAMPAIGN. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GONNA THAW IT OUT IN 2020. IN FACT, THAT'S MY NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, "JINDAL 2020: THAW IT OUT!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAW IT OUT? THAT'S PRETTY CATCHY. SO WHAT'S NEXT IMMEDIATELY FOR BOBBY JINDAL? I KNOW A LOT OF POLITICIANS END UP GETTING THEIR OWN TV SHOWS.
THAT'S THE GOAL, JIMMY. I'M TALKING TO FOX NEWS ABOUT HOSTING A SHOW WHERE I TRAVEL THE COUNTRY, HELPING REAL AMERICANS SOLVE REAL PROBLEMS. IT WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED "BOBBY JINDAL'S ADVENTURES ACROSS AMERICA," BUT I THOUGHT THAT WAS A BIT TOO LONG. SO I SHORTENED IT TO "BJ'S ACROSS AMERICA." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, WOW. WOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH. MY FAMILY REACTED THE SAME EXACT WAY. THEY'RE ALL LIKE, "GROSS!" AND, "DAD, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?" KIDS, AM I RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, LOOK, I HOPE YOU TAKE SOME TIME OFF TO RELAX BEFORE YOU LAUNCH INTO THIS NEW PROJECT.
OH, I WILL. I STARTED A NEW HOBBY ACTUALLY. MY GOOD BUDDY GEORGE W. BUSH GOT ME INTO OIL PAINTIN'. I'VE BEEN REALLY CRANKIN' 'EM OUT.
Jimmy: COOL, COOL. WHAT DO YOU PAINT? DO YOU PAINT STILL LIFE OR LANDSCAPE?
NOT EXACTLY. I'VE BEEN DOING THESE REALLY HIGH CONCEPT NUDES. CHECK IT OUT, IT'S ME RIDING AN EAGLE STRAIGHT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S SOMETHING RIGHT THERE. THAT IS SOMETHING, YEAH.
I'VE GOT TO ASK. IS THIS REALLY GOING TO BE ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW"?
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
YOU DO REALIZE I'M BOBBY JINDAL, RIGHT?
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. WE LOVE HAVING YOU ON.
OH, THAT'S SO NICE TO HEAR. THIS IS EVEN BETTER THAN BEING PRESIDENT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, WE'RE JUST GLAD THAT YOU'RE DOING WELL AND THAT YOU'RE HAPPY.
WELL, THANK YOU, JIMMY. BUT I'M ACTUALLY VERY DEPRESSED.
Jimmy: BOBBY JINDAL, EVERYBODY. BOBBY JINDAL, THERE HE IS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HIGH CONCEPT NUDES.
Steve: HIGH CONCEPT NUDES.
Jimmy: HIGH CONCEPT NUDES, YEAH.
Steve: THAT WAS YOUR FIRST BAND, WASN'T IT?
Jimmy: HEY, GUYS, I WANT TO SAY CONGRATS TO OLYMPIC SWIMMER MICHAEL PHELPS AND HIS FIANCEE, NICOLE JOHNSON, WHO JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ARE EXPECTING A BABY BOY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO IT LOOKS LIKE YET ANOTHER PHELPS SWIMMER JUST WON A RACE. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY GOOD. [ APPLAUSE ] I ALSO WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO DAVID BECKHAM, WHO WAS JUST NAMED "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE'S SEXIEST MAN ALIVE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT APPARENTLY WHEN BECKHAM FOUND OUT HE SAID, QUOTE, "I NEVER FEEL THAT I'M AN ATTRACTIVE, SEXY PERSON." YEAH. HE WENT ON TO SAY, "WHEN I THINK OF MYSELF AND MY BODY, I JUST THINK, BLAH." [ LAUGHTER ] "LIKE WHEN I GO SWIMMING IN PUBLIC, I LIKE TO WEAR A BIG T-SHIRT IN THE POOL SO I DON'T FEEL EMBARRASSED. MOST DAYS I'M JUST VEGGING AT HOME EATING PEANUT BUTTER WITH A SPOON. ANYWAYS, THANKS, 'PEOPLE' MAGAZINE FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO PUT A DAD-BOD LIKE ME ON YOUR COVER." [ APPLAUSE ] HE'S NOT THAT GOOD-LOOKING.
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: COME ON, HE'S RIGHT. HEY, IF YOU GUYS ARE IN A A RELATIONSHIP, YOU MIGHT WANNA LISTEN TO THIS. A RELATIONSHIP EXPERT JUST TOLD "THE WASHINGTON POST" THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A A RELATIONSHIP SHOULDN'T REACH OUT TO EX-LOVERS ON FACEBOOK BECAUSE IT CAN OFTEN LEAD TO AN AFFAIR. HE ALSO RECOMMENDED NOT REFERRING TO ANYONE AS YOUR EX-LOVER BECAUSE IT CAN LEAD TO PEOPLE AROUND YOU GAGGING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE SHOULD LEAVE THIS PARTY. MY EX-LOVER IS HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ GAGGING ] I THOUGHT THIS WAS INTERESTING, HERE. A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT MILLENNIALS ARE MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ECONOMY IMPROVING THAN PAST GENERATIONS. YEAH. MOST MILLENNIALS ARE CONFIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF HIGH-PAYING JOBS FOR THEIR PARENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] WHEN ARE WE GOING TO REMODEL THE BASEMENT, DUDES? THIS IS KIND OF AMAZING. A CHIHUAHUA IN PUERTO RICO NAMED MILLIE IS THE GUINNESS WORLD RECORD HOLDER FOR THE WORLD'S SMALLEST FULLY GROWN DOG AT ONE POUND AND LESS THAN FOUR INCHES TALL. MARKING THE FIRST DOG THAT HAS A LEGITIMATE REASON TO BE SCARED OF THE VACUUM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, SHUT IT OFF, SHUT IT OFF, HONEY. GOT TO GET -- LET MILLIE OUT OF THE BAG. COME HERE, MILLIE, COME HERE. HELP ME PUT A LEASH ON MILLIE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, MILLIE, GET OUT OF THERE. GUYS, I SAW THAT AN ANIMALS RIGHTS GROUP IS SUING AN AMUSEMENT PARK IN LOUISIANA FOR LETTING A CHIMPANZEE DRINK SODA AND SMOKE CIGARETTES. MEANWHILE, THE CHIMP WAS LIKE, YOU NERDS NEED TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GET A LIFE! AND FINALLY, THIS IS GREAT. ONE OF THE GAMES WE SOMETIMES PLAY ON OUR SHOW HERE IS CALLED THE WHISPER CHALLENGE. AND YOU PUT HEADPHONES ON, NOISE CANCELLING, AND YOU TRY TO GUESS WHAT SOMEONE'S SAYING EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T HEAR THEM. JUST READ THEIR LIPS. WELL, A FAMILY IN TEXAS DECIDED TO USE THE WHISPER CHALLENGE TO MAKE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT. AND CHECK OUT HOW IT WENT.

Jimmy: NOT ME, NO. BUT GROWING UP IT MUST HAVE BEEN TOUGH, STARTING INTO ACTING. PEOPLE CALL YOU OTHER NAMES?
PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY SAY WEEZE, WISE. YOU KNOW, WHO CAN BLAME THEM. THERE'S A "W" THERE, SO IT MAKES SENSE. IT'S PRONOUNCED WITH A " V."

BUT I'D GONE TO THE LOO AND I WAS JUST WASHING MY HANDS AND THE GUY IN CHARGE OF THE PRINCE WAS LIKE, "THE PRINCE IS COMING, THE PRINCE IS COMING!" SO, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DRY MY HANDS.
Jimmy: NO, NO! [ LAUGHTER ] NO, NO, NO!
YES, YES, YES!
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH --
SO I RAN TO THE SPOT AND I WAS MEETING HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME. I CURTSIED AND SAID, "GOOD EVENING, YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS, SUCH A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. I'M SORRY MY HANDS ARE WET. I JUST WASHED AND DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DRY THEM." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS A MESS. AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID, "WELL, AT LEAST THEY'RE CLEAN." [ LAUGHTER ]

THEY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE VERY SPECIAL.
Jimmy: THEY'RE GOOD LIKE THAT, HUH?
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD, THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T RETURN ANY OF MY E-MAILS OR ANYTHING, WHICH IS A BIT RUDE. BUT BESIDES THAT THEY'RE VERY NICE, I'M SURE.
I WAS GOING TO WRITE HER, THEY DON'T ACCEPT E-MAILS. YOU HAVE TO WRITE BY HAND. I ASKED.
Jimmy: OH YEAH, MY HANDWRITING IS TERRIBLE. IT WOULD NEVER MAKE IT THROUGH SECURITY. [ LAUGHTER ] AWFUL SCRIBBLES. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FILM.

THE LETTER WE FOUND IN WHICH YOU PROFESSED YOUR LOVE FOR ANOTHER MAN. MOMMY HAD TO ENDURE THAT HUMILIATION, TOO. MY NECESSARY EXPERIMENTATION IN SEXUAL MATTERS AS YOU PUT IT. SO YOUR MUSICAL EXPERIMENTATION WASN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU. NO YOU TO EXPERIMENT IN HOMOSEXUALITY, TOO. YOU DIDN'T GIVE A -- ABOUT ALL THE ANGUISH THAT YOU CAUSED HER. SO DON'T YOU COME TELLING ME THAT YOU COULDN'T UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND A -- THING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

AND THERE'S THIS THING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT OVERNIGHT. THERE'S A THING CALLED OVERNIGHT SUCCESS. THERE IS NO SUCH ANIMAL. YOU GOTTA BUST YOUR ASS.
Jimmy: YOU DO.
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO, YOU HAVE TO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S A GREAT MESSAGE.
WHATEVER IT IS, YOU GOTTA WORK, WORK, WORK, LEARN YOUR CRAFT, PERFECT YOUR CRAFT, AND JUST GO AT IT.

YOU GOTTA STAY ON IT -- STAY AT IT.

NEXT ONE.
Jimmy: YEAH, RIGHT. BUT ANYWAYS, SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS AND SO I WAS SO PSYCHED ABOUT IT. IT'S GETTING CRAZY GOOD REVIEWS. IT'S CALLED "CHI-RAQ," SO CHICAGO, BUT HOW CRAZY IT IS WITH WEAPONS AND EVERYTHING. AND ALL THE STUFF THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN CHICAGO, THE STATS ARE JUST STAGGERING. IT'S JUST AWFUL. IF YOU COMPARE THEM TO HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED OR SHOT IN IRAQ.
YEAH, IRAQ IS SAFER.
Jimmy: YEAH, ISN'T THAT CRAZY?
THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO.

DOWN FOR THE CAUSE, BUT HOW? WE FORCE OUR MEN TO NEGOTIATE PEACE BY EXERCISING SELF-CONTROL AND TOTAL ABSTINENCE FROM KNOCKING THE BOOT. [ SHOUTING ]
MAN, YOU REALLY THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD BRING PEACE?
Y'ALL KNOW THE POWER WE HAVE OVER THEM WITHHOLDING JUST A A DAY. A WEEK. IMAGINE A MONTH. A YEAR. [ CHATTERING ]
OH, THEY GOING TO BRING THE PEACE!
SUPPOSE -- SUPPOSE THAT THE MEN JUST DUMP US?
IF WE ALL HOLD OUT, WHO CAN THEY GO TO? [ SHOUTING ]
