YESTERDAY THE SUPREME COURT SPENT OVER AN HOUR LISTENING TO ARGUMENTS ON WHETHER OBAMACARE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. YEP.

[ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T HAVE TO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. A WOMAN PRESIDENT. YEP. THEN CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID, "WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR JUST SOMEONE WHO WEARS A BRA?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU GO, "NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SAYING CHRIS, BUT THANK YOU FOR ASKING."
Steve: HEY. FORGET ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: "THANK YOU FOR ASKING." BUT ACTUALLY SHE MAY HAVE SOME COMPETITION. THERE'S RUMORS FORMER MARYLAND GOVERNOR MARTIN O'MALLEY MAY ENTER THE RACE AND CHALLENGE HILLARY FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. YEAH, HILLARY'S NOT WORRIED. I MEAN, WHO'S GOING TO GO FROM BEING TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO BEATING HER FOR THE PRESIDENCY? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? I MEAN THAT'S -- HOW WOULD THAT EVER HAPPEN? [ APPLAUSE ] OH, GUYS, I SAW THAT KIM KARDASHIAN WAS "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE'S GUEST EDITOR THIS WEEK. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I ALREADY KNEW YOU KNEW. I KNEW YOU KNEW. I KNEW YOU ALL KNEW. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU COULD TELL THEY GAVE HER A A LOT OF CONTROL OVER THE ISSUE'S CONTENT. I MEAN, LOOK AT SOME OF THESE ARTICLES. FIRST WE HAVE "TOP THREE OTHER BABY NAMES BASED ON COMPASS DIRECTIONS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT THERE'S "WHAT TO BUY YOUR MANAGER FOR MOTHER'S DAY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S INTERESTING. AND FINALLY WE HAVE "TOP FIVE SPEECHES YOUR HUSBAND HAS INTERRUPTED." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A GOOD READ. IT'S A GOOD READ. YOU SHOULD PICK IT UP. THIS IS A LITTLE SCARY HERE. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT RUSSIA IS ACTUALLY WORKING WITH NORTH KOREA TO ENCOURAGE COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. YEAH. THEY BELIEVE THAT WITH RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC POWER AND NORTH KOREA'S TECHNOLOGY THEY COULD BE A REAL THREAT TO 1987. [ LAUGHTER ] SOME COOL TECH NEWS HERE.

Steve: DID YOU?
Jimmy: I READ THAT AIRLINES IN THE U.S. MAY SOON INCLUDE LESS SEATS ON PLANES, WHICH WOULD INCREASE PASSENGER LEG ROOM, BUT COST MORE PER TICKET. IN AN EFFORT TO BE MORE GREEN AND USE LESS FUEL.
YEAH. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO THINK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M SORRY, GUYS. IT'S SCOTT SEYMOUR THE FALSETTO CONSPIRACY THEORIST. [ LAUGHTER ] SCOTT, YOU THINK THAT AIRLINES ARE JUST SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE GREEN AS A WAY TO CHARGE MORE MONEY?
THINK? JIMMY, I KNOW. THESE AIRLINES ARE RUN BY CORPORATE BIG WIGS WHO COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. THEY JUST WANT MORE BENJAMINS TO LINE THEIR SUIT POCKETS.
Jimmy: RIGHT, RIGHT. NOW, COULD YOU JUST REMIND ME, HOW DID YOUR VOICE GET TO BE LIKE THAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
A RACCOON BIT OFF ONE OF MY TESTICLES. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER. MY POINT IS THE AIRLINES DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT BEING GREEN ANY MORE THAN THE GOVERNMENT CARES ABOUT THE WIDELY ACCEPTED FACT THAT THE ROSETTA SPACE PROBE WAS ACTUALLY AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT. THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S BEEN EMITTING SIGNALS FOR YEARS.
Jimmy: HOW DID A RACCOON BITE OFF YOUR TESTICLE? I'M -- [ LAUGHTER ]
I WAS TAKING OUT THE TRASH ONE NIGHT AND I SAW A RACCOON IN MY TRASH CAN. I TRIED TO SHOO IT AWAY WITH A A BROOM BUT IT JUMPED ON MY LEG AND BIT OFF MY LEFT NUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. THAT'S -- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S RIDICULOUS. THE FACT THAT ANY SORT OF NET NEUTRALIZATION ACT HAS YET TO BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. IT'S SO OBVIOUS THAT --
Jimmy: I'M SORRY. BUT YOU WEREN'T WEARING PANTS AT THE TIME THAT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
IT WAS A HOT SUMMER NIGHT. SO I TOOK TO MY TRASH TO THE CURB NAKED FROM THE WAIST DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO A RACCOON BIT ONE TESTICLE OF YOUR HALF NAKED BODY.
JIMMY, I'D LOVE TO GET BACK TO MY CONSPIRACIES.
Jimmy: YEAH. I'M SO SORRY. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR THEORIES. I JUST THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT YOU WERE TRAUMATIZED BY THIS RACCOON THING AND FOR SOME REASON YOU DECIDED TO FOCUS YOUR ENERGY ON --
AH! AH! MY TESTICLE! AH! MY TESTICLE! AH! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. HEY! HEY! GET OUT OF HERE. HEY! GET OUT OF HERE!

I WAS A LITTLE OFFENDED, I HAVE TO SAY.

YEAH, NUMBER TWO. AND A LITTLE BOY THIS TIME.
Jimmy: OH, IS THAT RIGHT? A LITTLE BOY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOUR DAUGHTER IS THE MOST CUTEST THING IN THE WORLD.
AW, YOU'RE SWEET.

YEAH, SHE DID. "I'M 4 1/2."
Jimmy: AND A HALF. YEAH. SHE'S SO CUTE. SHE'S EXCITED ABOUT HER BROTHER?
SHE'S ECSTATIC. SHE KEEPS -- EVERY DAY, "IS HE READY YET? IS HE READY?" LIKE IT'S A CAKE.
Jimmy: IS SHE TRYING TO NAME THE BABY?
YEAH. THE FIRST NAME SHE CAME UP WITH BECAUSE SHE KNEW IT WAS A BOY WAS SPIDER-MAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. CONSIDER IT.
IT'S A GOOD NAME. AND I'M SURE DADDY WOULD ACTUALLY PROBABLY BE OKAY WITH IT. BUT I THINK WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE.
Jimmy: YEAH, WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE. SPIDER-MAN. NOT BAD.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: DID YOU GET GOOD FEEDBACK FROM WHAT WE DID? THE "SAVED BY THE -- "
WHAT FEEDBACK? I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

I KNOW. WAS THAT CRAZY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: CRAZY. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. YOU GUYS WERE ALL SO NICE. I MEAN WE WERE VERY NERVOUS.
SAME. I MEAN IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. YOU GUYS MADE IT SO FUN FOR US. YOU REALLY DID.
Jimmy: OH GOOD. BUT WE TRIED TO GET IT DOWN AND EVERYTHING DOWN TO A T.
YOU HAD EVERYTHING DOWN. THE LOCKER NUMBERS. THE TRASH CAN. THE STAIRCASE. EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: REALLY? OKAY, GOOD.
YEAH, IT WAS GREAT.
Jimmy: I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE HAD EVERYTHING.
OH, YOU DID. O, YOU DID.
Jimmy: AND EVERYONE -- SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT ONLINE THAT THAT WAS JUST A CHARACTER'S CHOICE, THAT WE MADE KELLY PREGNANT.
EXACTLY. PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS PART OF THE SKIT. I WAS LIKE, "NO, PEOPLE, THAT'S NOT FAKE."
Jimmy: YOU'RE THE BEST. BUT IT WAS THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE'VE DONE I THINK EVER AS FAR AS GOING VIRAL ON OUR SHOW. IT JUST WENT -- EXPLODED.
IT'S FUNNY. I THINK ALL OF US KNEW IT WOULD DO WELL BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN HAVING THE PRESSURE AND BEEN HEARING ABOUT PEOPLE WANTING TO SEE THE REUNION.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I'D NEVER IN MY LIFE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE THAT. I THINK WE'RE ALMOST LIKE 30 MILLION.
Jimmy: 30 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED JUST ON YOUTUBE, NOT COUNTING THE MILLIONS THAT SAW IT ON -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HAVE TO SAY, YOU LOOK THE SAME.
OH, YOU'RE SWEET.

Jimmy: WHY DID -- HAS THERE NOT BEEN A CHEF NAMED TIFFANI FOR ALL THESE YEARS?
I GUESS NOT.
Jimmy: IT'S BRILLIANT. I WISH I THOUGHT OF IT. IT'S SO GOOD. AND I'M WATCHING THE THING, AND I GO -- BECAUSE I LOVE COOKING SHOWS.
DO YOU? DO YOU COOK AT ALL?
Jimmy: I HAVE COOKBOOKS.
OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A START. IT'S A START.
Jimmy: YEAH. I'M TRYING TO BECAUSE I DON'T -- SOME THINGS I'M JUST NOT -- AND IT TAKES ME TOO LONG. SO ONCE I'M DONE I GO, "THERE YOU GO. THERE'S ONE HAMBURGER PATTY. NOW WHO ELSE WANTS TO EAT SOMETHING?" YEAH. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE --
FOR A FEW PEOPLE, YEAH. IT'S DEFINITELY -- IT'S TIME-CONSUMING. YOU HAVE TO -- IT'S A RHYTHM. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A RHYTHM.
Jimmy: IT'S ALL ABOUT TIMING AND --
TIMING AND -- YEAH. AND ALCOHOL. ALCOHOL IS THE ONE THING YOU NEED IN THE KITCHEN.
Jimmy: OH, TRUST ME, THEN I AM A COOK. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY GOOD COOK THEN YEAH. I'VE WATCHED A TON OF EPISODES AND ONE OF THEM WAS A BARBECUE. I'M OBSESSED WITH BARBECUE. YOU DID A BARBECUE RUB AND YOU DID -- AND THE SAUCE.
YEP.
Jimmy: DOUBLE WHAMMY.
DOUBLE WHAMMY. I MARRIED A TEXAN. I'VE GOT TO KNOW HOW TO DO RIBS.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS.
DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS.
Jimmy: AND THEN THE TEA, THE PEACH TEA THAT YOU MADE, I LOVED THAT. I COULDN'T GET THAT FAR. I WOULD JUST GET TO THE ALCOHOL AND THEN JUST PUT AN ICE CUBE IN IT AND JUST GO WITH THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU MIX IT WITH OTHER THINGS. IT'S VERY INTERESTING.
THE COCKTAIL THING IS A KNEW THING FOR ME THAT I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. SO I FEEL VERY GROWN UP DOING COCKTAILS NOW. IT'S KINDA FUN.
Jimmy: RIGHT?
YEAH. VERY TOM CRUISE.
Jimmy: EXACTLY. BUT ALSO HOW COMFORTABLE YOU ARE AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE -- I WAS LIKE, "HOW DO YOU REMEMBER ALL THESE RECIPES?" YOU'RE DOING THINGS -- BECAUSE IT MOVES. AND IT'S FUN AND YOU'RE FUNNY AND YOU DID DIFFERENT VOICES AND YOU'RE LIKE, "THIS ONE'S GOING TO GO SLOW AND LOW." LOOK AT YOU.
I AM SUCH A DORK. I AM. I'M A BIG DORK.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. THERE'S NO WAY. IT'S SO EXCITING AND SO FUN. AND I WAS GOING TO ACTUALLY DO A SHOT OR SOMETHING WITH YOU. BUT OF COURSE --
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
Jimmy: FOR SPIDER-MAN I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.
WE CAN DO IT IN THE BACK. NO ONE WILL KNOW.
Jimmy: FOR SPIDER-MAN'S SAKE I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.
I BROUGHT YOU SOME TREATS, THOUGH. AND THE SECOND BEST THING TO ME, BESIDES ALCOHOL, IS CHOCOLATE. SO THESE ARE ACTUALLY CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER BITES. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] LIKE A VERSION OF BUCKEYES. [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW. THEY'RE SO GOOD.
Jimmy: CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER. HOW DO YOU --
