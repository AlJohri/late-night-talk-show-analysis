Jimmy: YOU'RE LIKE A COOL CUSTOMER.
WELL, I FEEL LIKE VERY COMFORTABLE IN FRONT OF PEOPLE, JUST LIKE YOU DO, JUST LIKE THE ROOTS DO. JUST LIKE MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OUR BUSINESS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND NBC UNIVERSAL WAS KIND ENOUGH TO LET ME TAKE A CHANCE ON DOING A SHOW. WHICH WE THINK IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS ON IN DAYTIME. I HAVE MY OWN BAND WITH ME. HOW MANY ARE Y'ALL? TEN? TEN GUYS? YEAH, WE HAVE TEN GUYS TOO, AND IT'S A BAND I TRAVEL WITH AND TOUR WITH. SO WE CAN PLAY MUSIC AT ANY TIME. IT'S VERY SPONTANEOUS. JUSTIN AND ERIC STANGEL, WHO YOU KNOW.

WE'RE SO FIRED UP.
Jimmy: I THINK YOU KNOW MY -- THAT WE HAVE A GUY -- OH, YEAH SURE, WE CAN CLAP FOR THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT TOO. OUR LIGHTING DIRECTOR DESIGNER WHAT'S PHIL'S OCCUPATION? WHAT IS? HE'S JUST HERE. PHIL, HE DOES ALL THE LIGHTS FOR "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE," PHIL HYMES HE'S A LEGEND, HE'S THE GREATEST GUY. AND HE'S THE BEST. HE SAW YOUR PILOT, AND HE  --
HE DID THE LIGHTING FOR IT.
Jimmy: OH, HE DID THE LIGHTING?
YUP.
Jimmy: AND ALL HE DID WAS TALK TO HE GOES, "THIS GUY, HARRY, IS UNBELIEVABLE."
THIS GUY.
Jimmy: HE IS SO -- AND I GO, HARRY? AND HE GOES "HE'S GOT A SHOW, HE'S GREAT" I GO HARRY WHO? I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING -- I'M LIKE HARRY STYLES? I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. HE'S LIKE "NO, HE PLAYS PIANO. HE PLAYS --" YEAH, HE'S GETTING MAD AT ME. HE'S LIKE HE PLAYS PIANO. HE GOES "HE'S SO QUICK. HE'S GOT IT. I KNOW IT I'VE SEEN IT. I'VE BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG. THIS GUY'S GOT IT." SO YOU GOT THE THUMB'S UP FROM PHIL.
YOU ASKED ME BEFORE IF I EVER GOT NERVOUS, SO, WHEN I SAW THAT THIS MAN WAS DOING THE LIGHTING FOR MY PILOT. YOU KNOW THE PILOT IS, THEY SHOOT THAT, AND THEY TRY TO USE THAT TO SELL THE SHOW AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND I WANTED TO BE, YOU KNOW, HAVING A GOOD TIME LIKE ANY TIME, AND THIS GUY, LET'S JUST SAY THAT HE'S VERY -- HE'S A A SERIOUS GUY. HE'S AN OLDER GUY. IN FACT, HE DID THE LIGHTING FOR, LIKE, THE HIP PARADE IN 1943 I THINK. LIKE AT --
Jimmy: OH, NO. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HIS DID YOU SEE HIS NBC ID?
OH, YEAH, IT'S LIKE A A SCROLL.
Jimmy: YES, IT'S A SCROLL. YEAH, EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ] NO BUT IT'S -- [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
HE'S BEEN, HE'S BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE.
Jimmy: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. HE'S BEEN AT NBC OVER 50 YEARS.
BUT HE'S YOU KNOW, HE'S SERIOUS, AND WHEN A GUY LIKE THAT PAYS YOU A COMPLIMENT, NO MATTER HOW SORT OF ROUNDABOUT IT IS --
Jimmy: YEP.
YOU REALLY, REALLY TAKE IT TO HEART. HE CAME UP TO ME AFTERWARDS AND HE SAID SOMETHING, LIKE, "I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT YOU BEFORE YOU CAME TODAY, BUT I TELL YA WHAT, THAT WAS, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M LIKE HE LOVES ME!
Jimmy: HE DOESN'T MESS AROUND.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND WHAT IS THE SET LIKE? WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? WHAT LIKE --
SO THE SET IS -- I THINK IT'S THE COOLEST THAT I'VE SEEN. YOUR SET IS PRETTY DARN COOL, BY THE WAY.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, YEAH.
BUT THIS SET IS REALLY COOL. IT'S THE BIGGEST SET I THINK IN MANHATTAN. WE HAVE A LOT OF SPACE TO, TO RUN AROUND AND PLAY MUSIC AND DO ALL KINDS OF STUFF. THE SHOW IS VERY, VERY SPONTANEOUS. WE DON'T PLAN MUCH AT ALL, BUT -- OH, YOU HAVE A PICTURE?
Jimmy: I HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE PHOTO.
OH COOL. I HOPE Y'ALL LIKE IT. YOU'VE GOT TO TELL US WHAT YOU THINK.
Jimmy: I THINK IT'S GORGEOUS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH. AND NO --
Jimmy: LOOK AT THAT.
YEAH. YOU CAN TURN THOSE INTO ANYTHING. AND THAT'S WHERE I TALK TO THE GUEST. AND WE CAN DO ALL KINDS OF STUFF LIKE COOKING OVER THERE, AND THE BAND IS OVER HERE.
Jimmy: YEAH I SAW YOU DID PARADE MAGAZINE, WHICH I LOVE THAT, LOVE THAT PARADE.
OH YEAH.
Jimmy: I READ IT ALL THE TIME, I CAN'T -- I JUST FLIP THROUGH IT, AND I SAW YOU BARBECUING ON IT. AND I GO OH HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO DO COOKING STUFF. ARE YOU A BARBECUE GUY?
I LOVE TO BARBECUE. YOU BARBECUE TOO, RIGHT?
Jimmy: I JUST GOT A A UNBELIEVABLE GRILL, IT'S LIKE INSANE, BUT LIKE IT'S CALLED A A KALAMAZOO.
I KNOW IT WELL. THAT'S AN EXPENSIVE GRILL. KALAMAZOO MAKES SOME SERIOUS, SERIOUS GRILLS.
Jimmy: SOME OF THEM ARE TOO SERIOUS FOR ME.
THE THING ABOUT -- THE MORE MONEY YOU SPEND --
Jimmy: I MAKE LIKE, BURGERS AND HOT DOGS.
I MEAN, THAT'S AWESOME ON A A REGULAR, YOU KNOW, NORMAL, LIKE, WEBER GRILL.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THE THING ABOUT THOSE EXPENSIVE GRILLS IS I THINK THE MAINTENANCE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE TOO, RIGHT?
Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S A GAS GRILL, RIGHT? THAT'S GOOD I GOT THAT. BUT THEN IT HAS DRAWER IN THE TOP AND I CAN PUT CHARCOAL IN THE DRAWER OR I THINK, LIKE, STICKS?
YEAH, SURE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PUT SOME STICKS IN THERE.
THAT'S SOME REAL SMOKING TERMINOLOGY, THOUGH. STICKS.
Jimmy: STICKS.
BUT SEE I DON'T REALLY COOK AS MUCH GRILL STUFF LIKE HOT DOGS AND HAMBURGERS. I LIKE TO SLOW COOK MEAT. SO I HAVE A SMOKER THAT WAS MADE DOWN IN HUMBLE, TEXAS BY THIS COMPANY CALLED PIT MAKER. AND YOU KNOW I'LL TAKE A BIG GIANT BRISKET, 16-17 POUNDS AND COOK IT ALL DAY.
Jimmy: REALLY?
LIKE 8 HOURS YEAH AND --
Jimmy: IN A SMOKER?
AND I'LL SMOKE IT ALL DAY LONG.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT?
I DO. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT.
Jimmy: YOU AND SNOOP DOGG.
YEAH.
Jimmy: SMOKING ALL DAY LONG.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: HE SHOULD HAVE HIS OWN LINE OF SMOKERS.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. FOR SURE. BUT THE INITIAL COST OF HIS IS A LOT LESS, BUT CUMULATIVELY IT PROBABLY ADDS UP TO A LOT MORE THAN MY SMOKER.
Jimmy: I JUST BAKE MY MEAT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I WONDER IF YOU CAN DO THAT? LIKE YOU JUST CUT OFF A REALLY SMALL PIECE OF BRISKET? I'M NOT GOING TO EXPERIMENT WITH THAT, BUT, YEAH. SO WHEN WE SEE THE SHOW, WHEN WE TUNE IN, WHAT DO WE GET TO SEE? ARE YOU COMING OUT AND TELL JOKES? ARE YOU GOING TO JUST INTERVIEW CELEBRITIES OR?
I TELL A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT THINGS, YOU KNOW, THAT HAPPENED TO ME OR THINGS THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED. AND THEN WE HAVE CELEBRITIES. LIKE, OUR FIRST WEEK, WE HAVE SANDRA BULLOCK, AND RENEE ZELLEWEGER.
Jimmy: OH, COME ON.
TERRENCE HOWARD, AND RUSSELL CROWE WE HAVE SOME REALLY GREAT GUESTS. AND THEN THE COOL THING IS, BECAUSE I'M THE GUY WHO WRITES THE MUSIC FOR THE SHOW, WE CAN JUST PLAY MUSIC AT ANY TIME.
Jimmy: YOU WROTE THE BUMPERS. THEY'RE CALLED BUMPERS.
YEAH, THE BUMPERS ARE WHAT LIKE WHEN YOU -- THE STUDIO AUDIENCE IS LUCKY, BECAUSE YOU GET TO HEAR THE WHOLE SONG, BUT THE PEOPLE AT HOME DON'T GET TO HEAR IT. BUT IT'S JUST THE MUSIC THAT LEADS YOU INTO THE COMMERCIAL AND THEN OUT OF THE COMMERCIAL. SO I'M THE GUY WHO WRITES ALL THAT STUFF.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW QUEST, YOU WROTE ALL THOSE BUMPERS RIGHT, WHEN WE FIRST STARTED.
Questlove: WE ALL DID.
Jimmy: YOU ALL DID YEAH. YOU TOOK MOST OF THE CREDIT, THOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Questlove: THANKS, JIMMY. [ LAUGHTER ]

TONS OF MUSIC, AND COMEDY.
Jimmy: WELL BECAUSE I SEE --
MAN ON THE STREET STUFF, AND YOU KNOW JIMMY WHAT WE'RE DOING, TOO, WE'RE CELEBRATING A A LOT OF EVERYDAY FOLKS. WHEN I GO ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND I TOUR, I MEET THESE AMAZING PEOPLE. LIKE, WE HAVE A SECTION CALLED A SEGMENT CALLED "HARRY'S LEADING LADIES," AND IT'S REALLY FUN BECAUSE THESE ARE AMAZING WOMEN THAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT IN THEIR COMMUNITY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND WE GET TO CELEBRATE THEM AND, YOU KNOW -- IT'S REALLY FUN.
Jimmy: I CAN'T --
IT'S REALLY COOL.
Jimmy: I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS THING. I'M EXCITED FOR IT. I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU I GO EVERY TIME TIME WE HAVE YOU HERE, WE ASK YOU TO LIKE PLAY SOMETHING, WE HAVE BIG A GRAND PIANO, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND I WAS JUST WONDERING MAYBE IF YOU EVER WANTED TO PLAY ANYTHING ON LIKE A TINY KEYBOARD? BECAUSE THAT'S --
WOW.

Jimmy: BUT WHEN WALK DOWN THE STREETS, ARE PEOPLE THERE ROUTING FOR YOU? 'CAUSE THEY KNOW WHO YOU ARE, I MEAN, EVEN IF YOU'RE WEARING THE HOODIE. NOW YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THAT.
NOW EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.
Jimmy: EVERYONE KNOWS THAT, THAT'S YOUR SECRET DISGUISE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT GUY CAN'T WALK AROUND AT ALL. BUT, DID YOU GO OUT TO EAT? OR DID YOU JUST FOCUS ON?
NO, I MEAN, AS SOON AS I GOT DONE SWIMMING, I CHECKED INTO THE HOTEL WITH MY FAMILY AND LEFT LIKE A DAY LATER. TWO DAYS LATER.
Jimmy: THAT WAS IT, YEAH. 'CAUSE OTHER PEOPLE CHOSE OTHER THINGS TO DO. [ LAUGHTER ] AND UH, YOU DIDN'T DO THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY DIDN'T CC YOU? THEY DIDN'T CC YOU ON THE INVITE CLEARLY.
I DIDN'T GET THE MEMO.
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T GET THE MEMO. YOU COULD'VE LET THEM KNOW WHERE THE BATHROOMS WERE, EVERYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE UH, WHEN YOU TALK TO RY-RY LET HIM KNOW THAT WERE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. HE CAN COME TALK TO ME WHENEVER HE WANTS.
OKAY, OKAY.
Jimmy: I WANT TO HEAR THE WHOLE SCOOP. AND TELL HIM THAT HE'S WELCOME TO COME HERE, 'CAUSE I'D LOVE TO HEAR THE FULL SCOOP OF THAT. CAUSE I WANT TO HEAR THE STORY. I GOT TO SAY, MY BIG STORY THAT I TOOK, CAUSE WHEN YOU SAID, "THAT'S IT, THIS IS MY LAST OLYMPICS." AND I GO, YOU WERE CHOKED UP, I WAS CHOKED UP, THE WORLD WAS TOO. 'CAUSE WE WERE JUST WATCHING IT LIKE, "WAIT WHAT? NO THERE'S MANY MORE WEATIES BOXES TO BE HAD." I MEAN THERE'S MANY MORE, COVERS OF MAGAZINES. AND THEN YOU GO, AND THEN UH, I SAW YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL BABY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: LOOK AT THIS, BABY BOOM.
I MEAN, HE'S AWESOME. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, THAT'S, I GO MAYBE I GET IT THEN I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW.
YEAH, YOU KNOW FOR ME, AFTER 2012 LIKE, I TOOK ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF OFF, AND I REALIZED I STILL HAD IT, AND I WANTED TO COME BACK. AND I WAS DOING IT FOR ME, AND THAT'S IT. AND I WANTED TO KIND OF PUT THE CHERRY ON TOP OF THE CAKE, AND FINISH HOW I WANTED TO. CAUSE I NEVER WANT TO HAVE THAT LIKE, 20 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD, I SAY, "WHAT IF?"
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND COMING BACK HOW I DID, GOING THROUGH THE UPS AND DOWNS THAT I HAD THROUGH THE COME BACK, THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO CAP OFF A 24 YEAR CAREER. AND YOU KNOW, BEING ABLE TO HAVE BOOMER AND NICOLE IN THE STANDS.
Jimmy: I LOVE BOOMER. WHY'D YOU NAME HIM BOOMER?
HONESTLY.
Jimmy: BOOMER ESIASON.
NO. WE HEARD THE NAME, AND WE DIDN'T WANT LIKE, A NORMAL NAME. I BROUGHT IT UP TO NICOLE AND SHE WAS LIKE AH, IT SOUNDS KIND OF COOL.
Jimmy: BOOMER.
BOOMER, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T HAVE A A SECOND OPTION?
BOOMER, LIKE BOOM BOOM. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAD NO SECOND OPTION. SO ONCE WE PICKED THAT, WE WERE LIKE --
Jimmy: YOU'RE A COOL KID, YEAH, THERE GOES BOOMER. IT'S A COOL KID.
I MEAN, HE'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE THE COOL KID.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
I MEAN, HE WENT FROM 5,000 FOLLOWERS, I RUN HIS ACCOUNT. I RUN IT. I DO ALL THE POSTING. NICOLE TAKES A LOT OF THE PHOTOS WHEN WERE NOT ALWAYS TOGETHER, AND SHE SENDS THEM OVER, AND I POST THEM. BUT ITS LIKE, I MEAN HE WENT FROM 5,000 FOLLOWERS IN LIKE LATE JUNE TO, I THINK I JUST LOOKED, HE HAS LIKE 660,000 FOLLOWERS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S INSANE. BOOMER'S LIKE, THE MOST FOLLOWED BABY IN THE WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] 16 WEEKS.
Jimmy: HE'S RUNNING. HE'S RUNNING FACEBOOK NOW. WHICH IS GREAT. NO, I JUMPED IN THE PHOTO, CAUSE I HAD TO GRAB HIM, I HAD TO SMELL HIS LITTLE HEAD.
I KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN A BABY SMELL. IT'S INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: BABY HEAD, AW, HE'S SO CUTE. OH MY GOD, HE'S A CUTE BABY. HE'S GOTTA BE PSYCHED. AND NOW YOU GUYS, OF WHAT I'VE HEARD, BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THE RUMORS ARE TRUE, BUT ARE YOU GOING TO PHOENIX, NO SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA?
WE LIVE IN ARIZONA, YEAH.
Jimmy: SO YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO ARIZONA, IS THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO KIND OF RETIRE, BECAUSE YOU'RE 31-YEARS-OLD. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THERE, AND JUST DO WHAT? GOLF? [ LAUGHTER ]
SO, THAT WOULD BE A NICE LIFE RIGHT?
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO, I AM VOLUNTEERING A A LITTLE BIT WHEN I CAN AT ASU FOR THE SWIM TEAM. JUST HELPING OUT, TRAVELING A A LITTLE BIT HERE AND THERE. UM, GOLFING, WE'RE GETTING MARRIED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] A VERY BUSY YEAR.
Jimmy: I MEAN THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF.
BUT WE'RE EXCITED AND PUMPED, AND THE LITTLE MAN GETS TO TRAVEL EVERYWHERE WITH US SO IT'S PRETTY AWESOME.
Jimmy: UH, THE MICHAELPHELPSFOUNDATION.ORG. DO YOU WANT TO TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT?
ONE THING FOR ME IS, IS LIKE, THERE'S AN IMPORTANT THING THAT WE ALL NEED TO LEARN IS WATER SAFETY, BUT ALSO, TEACHING KIDS TO LIVE HEALTHY AND ACTIVE LIFE STYLES. DROWNING FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 14 IS THE SECOND HIGHEST CAUSE OF DEATH AND THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE. AND I THINK WE'RE ALMOST IN, I THINK ABOUT TEN STATES BEFORE WE GET TO EVERY SINGLE STATE WHERE WE HAVE A SWIM PROGRAM IN EACH STATE. UM, WORKING INTERNATIONALLY WITH SPECIAL OLYMPICS, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB, AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT, BECAUSE SWIMMING'S BEEN A PART OF MY LIFE FOR SO LONG. I'M OUT OF THE POOL, COMPETITIVELY, BUT I'M STILL HELPING. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE, AND WE ARE GOING TO DO IT DAY BY DAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WATER SAFETY.
Jimmy: TEACH THEM HOW TO SWIM. LIKE THE ONLY REASON I EVER GOT IN THE WATER WAS, MY MOM JUST WANTED ME TO LEARN HOW TO SWIM. AND MY SISTERS AND MYSELF, FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SPORT, AND WE DECIDED TO SWIM. AND YOU KNOW, JUST BEING ABLE TO BE COMFORTABLE IN THE WATER IS WHAT WE WANT. AS MANY KIDS AS WE CAN. I KNOW IN ARIZONA, LEADING INTO OLYMPIC TRIALS THERE WAS NINE OR TEN CHILDREN HAD DIED BY THE MONTH OF JUNE THIS YEAR. IN DROWNING INCIDENTS, AND THAT HAS TO CHANGE, AND I UH, HAVE A A LOT OF TIME NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I HAVE A FULL PLATE. A LOT OF WORK TO DO, BUT IT'S SOMETHING I ENJOY.
Jimmy: WELL I HOPE TO SEE YOU MAYBE AT SOME OF THESE CHARITY EVENTS.
YES, YES.
Jimmy: WE'LL DO A PRO AM. GOLF TOGETHER. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I WOULD LOVE TOO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU KNOW WE HAVE UH, WE PLAY A LOT OF GAMES ON THE SHOW AND I WAS JUST WONDERING, MAYBE IF YOU HAD TIME, MAYBE, I KNOW YOU'RE VERY, VERY BUSY, BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO --
