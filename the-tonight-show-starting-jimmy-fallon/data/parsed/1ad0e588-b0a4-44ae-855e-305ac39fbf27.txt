Jimmy: THE AUDIENCE JUST WENT NUTS, ISN'T THAT FANTASTIC.
IT'S BRILLIANT MAKEUP.
Jimmy: THEY WERE LIKE, WOW, THAT'S NOT REAL BUT IT IS YOU.
JUDI DENCH, ABSOLUTELY LOVELY. AND I WAS FILMING THIS IN RICHMOND AND PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WERE DOING ANOTHER BOND, DARLING.
Jimmy: IT'S SO PERFECT.
IT'S REALLY BRILLIANT MAKEUP.
Jimmy: AND SHE ENJOYS IT AS WELL, THE IMPRESSION?
SHE DOES. SHE DOES. SHE ACCEPTED AN AWARD AND SAID, "HELLO, I'M TRACEY ULLMAN." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I PLAY HER LIKE A A KLEPTOMANIAC BECAUSE SHE IS A A NATIONAL TREASURE, SHE CAN GET AWAY WITH EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: WHY WOULD SHE EVER DO THAT?
SHE CAN SHOPLIFT AND SLASH TIRES AND EVERYONE GOES, "THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE JUDI DENCH."
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYBODY A CLIP, BECAUSE I DO LOVE IT. HERE IS TRACEY ULLMAN AS DAME JUDI DENCH ON "TRACEY ULLMAN'S SHOW." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
I SAW THAT. YOU WANT ME TO CALL THE POLICE?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
IT'S YOU ISN'T IT?
IF YOU MEAN, IS IT DAME JUDI DENCH, THEN YES IT IS. HOW VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
SORRY ABOUT THAT. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SECURITY CAMERA.
YES, WELL THEY CAN BE TEMPERAMENTAL.
I LOVED YOU IN JAMES BOND.
OH, WE JUST TRY TO TELL A A GOOD STORY. AND THANK YOU.
WHAT WAS I THINKING? DAME JUDI DENCH WOULDN'T SHOPLIFT. YOU'RE A NATIONAL TREASURE.
EXACTLY. BECAUSE I'M A NATIONAL TREASURE, I CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING, BUT OF COURSE I DON'T. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
