Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.
YEAH, I JUST GET HERE TO BE A SUN SHINY PERSONALITY THAT I AM.
Jimmy: YOU'VE BEEN COMING HERE FOR A LONG TIME.
I HAVE.
Jimmy: THIS IS LIKE WHEN WE WERE DOING "LATE NIGHT." DID WE TALK ABOUT THIS LAST TIME?
I DON'T KNOW, WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE SAME THING.
Jimmy: WE DO RIGHT? DID WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE RACED EACH OTHER AND HAD VODKAS?
YEAH, YOU HAD ONE OF YOUR ACCIDENTS. YOU'RE PRETTY ACCIDENT PRONE. YOU KNOW, YOU LIKE FALL ALL THE TIME.
Jimmy: I USED TO. I'M OVER THAT NOW. I'M ON A NEW THING. IT WAS A FAD I WAS IN. IT'S A PHASE.
WE MADE MARGARITAS AND WE CHASED EACH OTHER AROUND. I HAD PUT ON LIKE NURSING SHOES OR SOMETHING AND HE FELL AND SLIPPED AND, LIKE, CUT HIS WRIST AND HE'S BLEEDING ON ME WHILE WE'RE DOING THE SHOW. I'M LIKE, ARE YOU OKAY? ARE YOU JUST A MAJOR LIKE LOSER?
Jimmy: I KNOW, I KNOW. I WAS SO EMBARRASSED.
IT'S EMBARRASSING TO FALL EVEN IF IT IS YOUR OWN SHOW.
Jimmy: IT IS TRUE. IT IS. IT'S EMBARRASSING TO FALL AND YOU CAN'T PLAY IT OFF. BECAUSE I DID A REALLY GOOD FALL.
NO, WHEN YOU'RE BLEEDING. I MEAN, IF IT WAS A GIRL -- SAY ANYTHING ABOUT BEING A A GIRL, YOU COULD START CRYING. AND THAT'S REALLY EMBARRASSING. BECAUSE GIRLS WILL CRY WHEN THEY FALL. AND IF YOU WOULD HAVE STARTED CRYING, I WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE, LISTEN UP, BITCH. GET IT TOGETHER.
Jimmy: COME ON. BUT, I DO REMEMBER BECAUSE I TRIED TO PLAY IT OFF 'CAUSE ONE OF OUR EARLIER SHOWS. I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO ACT LIKE I WAS HURTING.
OR OUT OF CONTROL. YOU WERE LIKE, "I GOT YOU."
Jimmy: I WAS HOLDING YOUR BOOK.
WHICH WOULD BE EVEN MORE EMBARRASSING TO WATCH SOMEBODY TRY TO PRETEND THEY'RE OKAY WHEN THEY'RE NOT. I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD WHEN IS THIS SHOW GOING TO BE OVER SO I CAN LEAVE?"
Jimmy: NO, YOU WERE ACTUALLY YELLING 'CAUSE I WAS HOLDING YOUR BOOK UP. I GO, "GUYS CHELSEA HANDLER. HER NEW BOOK." YOU GO, "HE'S BLEEDING. HE'S BLEEDING." THERE'S BLOOD ALL OVER YOUR BOOK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] UNBELIEVABLE. BUT I'M HAPPY YOU CAME BACK AFTER THAT 'CAUSE I WAS LIKE, THAT COULD HAVE SCARED OFF ANYONE.

MAZEL TAV.
Jimmy: THEY DO. MAZEL TAV. YEAH. CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO EVERYBODY I WANT TO KNOW TWO THINGS. ONE IS YOU HAVE THE SHOW ON E!. YOU'RE THE BIGGEST NAME ON E!
WAS I THE BIGGEST NAME ON E!?
Jimmy: THAT WASN'T A A KARDASHIAN. YEAH, I THINK SO.
I WAS THINKING PHYSICALLY THE BIGGEST. YOU'RE RIGHT.
Jimmy: NO, YOU'RE NOT.
I DIDN'T HAVE A BIG ENOUGH ASS TO STAY ON THAT NETWORK.
Jimmy: YOU WERE JUST -- BUT YOU WERE CRUSHING IT THOUGH. AND DOING THIS TALK SHOW AND IT WAS GREAT, YOU WERE GETTING GREAT GUESTS. AND PEOPLE WERE WATCHING. THEN YOU GO, I'M GOOD GUYS. I'M DONE. AND THEN YOU JUST LEFT AND WALKED AWAY. THAT WOULD MAKE ME NERVOUS. BUT, THEN YOU COME BACK WITH NETFLIX.
IT MADE ME NERVOUS. TOTALLY NERVOUS. I WAS NERVOUS. YOU GET NERVOUS. YOU HAVE A CAREER AND YOU'RE LIKE, OH, GOD, I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE OFF. IT MADE ME NERVOUS. BUT, I THINK IT'S GOOD TO BE NERVOUS. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED. I WANT TO BE IN A GOOD MOOD WHEN I GET TO WORK EVERYDAY. AND I WAS SO ANNOYED. I WAS LIKE, "THIS PLACE IS SO STUPID." I WANTED TO NOT BE ANNOYED. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I WANTED TO BE LIKE GRATEFUL THAT I HAVE THIS LIFE THAT I GET TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO AND FLY AROUND THE WORLD AND FUN THINGS. I'M LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO BE AN ASS, I WANT TO BE HAPPY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU WERE IN A BAD MOOD. YOU WERE IN A BAD PLACE.
IT WAS LIKE I HAD MY PERIOD ALL THE TIME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
HAVE YOU EVER HAD YOUR PERIOD? IT'S NOT PRETTY.
Jimmy: WELL, NOT YET. YEAH.
YOU'RE STILL WAITING.
Jimmy: ONE DAY. BUT THEN YOU COME OUT WITH THESE DOCUMENTARIES. AND I GO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE LIKE. AND ALL YOUR FANS ARE LIKE I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY JUST CHELSEA. BUT, WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. AND GOSH, YOU KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I LOVED THEM.
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
Jimmy: EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
THAT'S SO NICE FOR YOU TO SAY.
Jimmy: THEY WERE ALL GREAT. THE ONE ON MARRIAGE IN PARTICULAR I LOVED. I THOUGHT THAT WAS MY FAVORITE ONE. BECAUSE YOU WERE REALLY, REALLY VULNERABLE. I SAW A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SIDE. I'M LIKE, YOU OPENED YOURSELF UP. YOU HAD YOUR ORIGINAL -- YOU HAD SOME OF YOUR OLD BOYFRIENDS ON.
YEAH I DID. I KNOW IT'S HARD TO GET THAT GOING. TO TALK TO PEOPLE YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO IN 20 YEARS. I JUST ASSUMED WERE STILL MAD AT ME.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, I'M PRETTY MAD AT EVERYBODY I'VE DATED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT IT WAS GREAT. IT WAS REALLY GOOD TO BE OUTSIDE MY COMFORT ZONE. I LIKE TO BE REALLY CHALLENGED. I LIKE TO BE NERVOUS WHEN I DO STUFF. I DON'T LIKE TO GET COMFORT. SO WITH NETFLIX I'M ABLE TO DO LIKE THIS WHOLE NEW SHOW I'M DOING. I'M JUST SO EXCITED ABOUT IT BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW WHAT IT IS EITHER.
Jimmy: WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THIS? MAY 11th, I KNOW IT'S ON.
IT'S ON. AND IT'S ON THREE NIGHTS A WEEK ON NETFLIX, WEDNESDAY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. AND IT'S KIND OF A MIX OF ALL THE THINGS -- I'M BASICALLY TREATING IT AS A COLLEGE EDUCATION THAT I FORGOT TO GET THAT NETFLIX IS FUNDING.
Jimmy: THAT'S VERY NICE OF THEM TO DO THAT FOR YOU.
IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD WANT COLLEGE TO BE ONCE YOU TURN 40 AND REALIZE WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN. WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW THAT YOU DON'T KNOW. GETTING ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. BUT ALSO KEEPING MY SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT EVERYTHING SO THAT YOU CAN GET INFORMATION IN A A FUN COOL WAY. LIKE IMAGINE IF, YOU KNOW, "60 MINUTES" WERE FUNNY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO IT'S LIKE THAT. I MEAN, THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT. SO, YOU KNOW, WITH ME -- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WATCH A SHOW, IT'S NEVER EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT IT. IT ALWAYS HAPPENS. YOU GET IN THE GROOVE AND THEN IT CHANGED A LITTLE.
Jimmy: EXACTLY.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU DID WITH YOUR SHOW. YOU MADE "LATE NIGHT" MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN IT WAS FOR A A LONG TIME.
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
NOW ALL THESE OTHER JACK-ASSES ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT INTERESTING TOO.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO, PLEASE. YOU WERE AHEAD OF YOUR TIME DOING STUFF. BUT WITH THIS SHOW, YOU ALSO THROW IN THIS FUN THING THAT I THINK YOU DID IN THE DOCUMENTARY, I THOUGHT WAS GREAT, YOU WOULD HAVE DINNER PARTIES WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
OH, IT'S THE BEST, THE BEST. I HAVE THESE PEOPLE COME OVER MY HOUSE. WE JUST DID A CAPTAIN AMERICA DINNER PARTY. SO, THEY COME TO MY HOUSE AND WE DRINK. AND THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO GET ON CAMERA. AND PEOPLE -- WE DID A A PARENTING ONE. WE DID A PARENTING DINNER PARTY 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY I KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT PARENTING. WITH KATE HUDSON AND MAYIM BIALIK. AND MALIN AKERMAN AND RANDALL PARK. I JUST LIKE TO POST DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE TOGETHER AND HAVE THEM IN MY HOME SO IT'S COMFORTABLE FOR EVERYBODY. IT'S JUST A MORE INTERESTING WAY TO ENGAGE PEOPLE AND CELEBRITIES IN GENERAL. YOU KNOW, AFTER THEY'VE DONE THIS WHOLE ROUTINE OF SHOWS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THAT BATMAN ANYMORE.
Jimmy: NO, YOU'RE DON'T WITH THAT.
I MEAN IT I WANT BATMAN TO TAKE A LONG HIKE.
Jimmy: YOU WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. YOU'RE DOING THIS THING IN ONE OF THE SHOWS YOU'RE DOING, YOU'RE WORKING WITH LYFT.
LYFT IS LIKE -- IT'S LIKE UBER BUT NOT. UBER IT'S THE OTHER URBER. SO I DID ON THESE --
Jimmy: YOU JUST PRONOUNCED IT URBER.
I THOUGHT IT WAS CALLED URBER.
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK YOU PRONOUNCE IT UBER. IT'S LIKE --
I THOUGHT IT WAS CALLED UMLACH FOR A LONG TIME TOO.
Jimmy: I'VE TAKEN THAT BEFORE. LYFT IS LIKE THE SAME TYPE OF DEAL, RIGHT? YOU CATCH A RIDE?
YEAH. SO, I DID A BUNCH OF [ BLEEP ]. I DO WHAT REGULAR PEOPLE DO IN THE REAL WORLD. BUT I'M VERY INTENT ON REMAINING NORMAL AND DOING NORMAL THINGS. LIKE I DO DOG WALKING. FOR A DOG WALKING SERVICE. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL. I DID LYFT. I WAS A DRIVER FOR LYFT. I WORE A BIG AFRO THOUGH. SO NOBODY WOULD RECOGNIZE ME. 'CAUSE I JUST WANTED TO REALLY EXPERIENCE IT AND PEOPLE ARE ASS [ BLEEP ].
Jimmy: LIKE "UNDERCOVER BOSS."
SORRY NBC AND YOU'RE WELCOME. AND THEN I DID TASK MASTER WHERE PEOPLE INVITE YOU TO THEIR HOME AND YOU PUT TOGETHER STUFF FOR THEM. I CAN'T BELIEVE STUFF LIKE THIS IS HAPPENING.
Jimmy: I KNOW, IT'S TRUE.
YOU JUST PICK AN APP AND LIKE SOME STRANGER SHOWS UP. I SHOWED UP AS ME OBVIOUSLY TO THESE PEOPLE AND THEY WATCHED ME PUT THE FURNITURE TOGETHER WHICH IS NOT MY IDEAL SITUATION.

THEY'LL VOUCH FOR ME. THAT WAS MY BACKGROUND BACK HOME, BEFORE I STARTED BEING VERY SERIOUS, WAS, YOU KNOW, STAND-UP AND LIKE, YOURSELF, SKETCH COMEDY. I MEAN, I WAS IN A SHOW CALLED "FULL FRONTAL" WHICH WAS VERY SIMILAR TO "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" ACTUALLY. SO, IT WAS JUST ALL --
Chelsea: DOES THAT SHOW YOUR PENIS, THAT SHOW? [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO.
NO, IT WAS, IT WAS --
Chelsea: FORGET IT, I DON'T CARE THEN.
FAMILY HOUR.
Jimmy: IT WAS LIKE "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"?
YEAH, IT WAS SIMILAR TO "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." IT WAS JUST ALL SKETCH BASED. WE WOULD DO PRERECORD DURING THE WEEK AND THEN FRIDAY NIGHTS WE'D GET AN AUDIENCE IN. AND I'D ALWAYS GET IN TROUBLE FOR LAUGHING.
Jimmy: YOU WOULD LAUGH IN THE MIDDLE OF SKETCHES?
I WAS A SHOCKER. YOU WERE REALLY BAD, TOO.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT TRUE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MY SHOW DIDN'T AIR IN AUSTRALIA. I WOULD LAUGH ALL THE TIME. I FELT BAD. I DIDN'T WANT TO LAUGH BUT IT WAS JUST SO FUNNY. THESE PEOPLE WERE OUT OF MY LEAGUE. I WAS ACTING WITH PEOPLE LIKE WILL FERRELL AND, YOU KNOW, MOLLY SHANNON AND THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST ON A DIFFERENT PLANET.
WAS WILL --
Chelsea: IT'S THE BEST FEELING IN A WORLD WHEN YOU CANNOT CONTROL YOURSELF.
Jimmy: YEAH.
Chelsea: AND YOU CAN'T BE LAUGHING AND YOU JUST CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER AND SOMETIMES YOU URINATE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT IS A PRETTY -- THAT'S A A SPECTACULAR FEELING.
Jimmy: IT REALLY IS, AND THEY WOULD KNOW THAT I'M AN EASY LAUGH SO THEY WOULD ACTUALLY PURPOSELY DO STUFF JUST TO TRY TO MAKE ME BREAK DURING SKETCHES.
THE THING THAT USED TO GET ME WAS HEAD TURNS. HEAD TURNS WERE THE WORST. YOU START A SKETCH AND YOU GO LIKE THAT. EVERY TIME. THE MINUTE SOMEONE TURNS THEIR HEAD TOWARDS ME, I'D BE GONE.
Jimmy: I'D LOSE IT, YEAH.
I ONCE GOT RIPPED BY MY EAR BY THE DIRECTOR AND ESCORTED OUT OF THE STUDIO LIKE A A 5-YEAR-OLD. BECAUSE THERE WAS A CO-STAR THAT I WOULD ALWAYS LAUGH AT. RIMA, HER NAME WAS. AND WE WOULD QUITE OFTEN DO SKETCHES TOGETHER. AND IT GOT SO BAD, WE GOT SEPARATED. AND WE'D HAVE TO DO SPLIT SCREENS. SO, I WOULD DO PRERECORDED SKETCHES TO LIKE, SOMEONE FROM THE CREW WHO WOULD JUST SIT THERE LIKE THIS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN THEY'D GET ME OUT AND THEY'D PUT HER IN AND THEN CUT IT TOGETHER.
Jimmy: I'M TERRIBLE LIKE THAT TOO. I JUST START SWEATING AND GO, I JUST HAVE TO LEAVE. LIKE, RICKY GERVAIS WAS JUST HERE YESTERDAY AND WE COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING. HE LAUGHS A LOT.
HE'S A BIG LAUGHER.
Jimmy: WHICH IS GOOD, I LIKE THAT.
I WAS ORIGINALLY SCARED THAT I'D GET IN TROUBLE FOR LAUGHING ON THE SET. HE'S THE BOSS, WRITER, DIRECTOR, AND CO-STAR. BUT HE WAS WORSE THAN ME, SO IT WAS LIKE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? REALLY, BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T STOP?
HE COULDN'T STOP. IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I'D BE LIKE, RICKY, WE GOT TO GET THE SHOT BEFORE LUNCH. NO, NO, WE'LL NEVER GET IT. [ BLEEP ] OFF, GET OUT OF HERE, NO, NO, MOVE ON. WE'LL NEVER GET IT, FORGET IT. MOVE ON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT HAPPENING. IT'S NOT HAPPENING. NO, NO.
Jimmy: BUT HE MADE YOU DO, YOU HAVE A, WELL HE DIDN'T MAKE YOU DO, BUT YOU HAVE A GREAT NEW YORK ACCENT IN THIS MOVIE. AND HE DID NOT. HE TOLD ME YESTERDAY, HE CHOOSES NEVER TO DO ANY ACCENTS BECAUSE HE'S JUST TOO LAZY. HE DOESN'T WANT TO.
I'M VERY ENVIOUS. THERE'S A LOT OF AUSTRALIANS IN HOLLYWOOD OBVIOUSLY BUT WE NEVER GET TO BE AUSTRALIAN. IT'S QUITE RACIST ACTUALLY, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
WE NEVER, EVER. WE HAVE TO HIDE. WE HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, SUPPRESS OUR IDENTITY. I THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A A SECOND. YOU KNOW, MAYBE I COULD GET AWAY WITH IT. 'CAUSE THERE'S PLENTY OF AUSTRALIANS IN THE MEDIA. BUT KELLY McDONALD WAS FROM SCOTLAND. I'M FROM AUSTRALIA. AND, RICKY WAS FROM ENGLAND. AND SO IT WAS LIKE, WE WEREN'T GOING TO GET AWAY WITH IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S TOO MUCH, YEAH. CAUSE IT IS AIRING IN NETFLIX, YEAH. BUT NETFLIX AIRS EVERYWHERE.
EXACTLY.
Chelsea: YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THIS ROOM THAT'S NOT ON NETFLIX.
Jimmy: I KNOW, I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S NOT ON NETFLIX.
Chelsea: WE'RE ONE BIG NETFLIX FAMILY.
Jimmy: WE GOT TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE -- WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK.
Jimmy: SHOULD I SET UP THE MOVIE AT ALL, "SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTS?" BASICALLY, YOU GUYS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO -- YOU'RE AN ON AIR RADIO REPORTER. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO A SPECIAL FROM ECUADOR.
MM-HMM.
Jimmy: BUT YOU LOSE YOUR TICKETS AND ACTUALLY DON'T GO TO ECUADOR, AND YOU END UP DOING THIS THING FROM ACROSS THE STREET IN A HOTEL ROOM.
WE HIDE IN A TAPAS RESTAURANT UPSTAIRS AND SET UP A STUDIO AND PRETEND WE'RE IN ECUADOR AND THE LIE JUST GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER AS THE MOVIE GOES ON.
Jimmy: WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S ERIC BANA AND RICKY GERVAIS. IN "SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTS." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
THIS PLACE, MIGHT BE A REBEL STRONGHOLD, THESE ARE KIND PEOPLE. SIMPLY NOT IN THEIR NATURE TO LET A MAN DIE ON THEIR LAND, WHOEVER THEY ARE. [ BLEEP ] EARLIER TODAY, I WATCHED AS A A WOMAN FROM THE VILLAGE DESPERATELY TRIED TO SAVE HER OWN CHILD. FEVERISHLY WIPING THE BLOOD OFF THE PAVEMENT. AS IF THAT WOULD SOMEHOW BRING HIM BACK. A PEASANT. FAT, SWEATY PEASANT, LOOKED ON, USELESS. HOPELESS. WORTHLESS EVEN. KNOWING THAT NOTHING HE EVER DID COULD POSSIBLY DO ANY GOOD. THIS IS FRANK BENNEVILLE LIVE FROM MACHELLA.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU GO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ERIC BANA, EVERYBODY, "SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTS" IS AVAILABLE EXCLUSIVELY ON NETFLIX THIS FRIDAY. NETFLIX IS DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A A PERFORMANCE FROM D'ANGELO AND SPECIAL GUEST PRINCESS. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
