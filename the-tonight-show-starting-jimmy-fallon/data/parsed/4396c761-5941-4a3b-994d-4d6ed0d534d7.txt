Questlove: 528!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AH-HA! HI, EVERYBODY. HEY! LOOKING GOOD. LOOKING GOOD OUT THERE TONIGHT. HOT CROWD. [ CHEERS ] WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, EVERYONE. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, EVERYONE. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE PART OF THE SHOW. OH, IT'S A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. SOME BIG TECH NEWS. APPLE UNVEILED THE iPHONE 7 TODAY, AND THE BIG STORY IS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE A A HEADPHONE JACK. INSTEAD, IT HAS WIRELESS EAR BUDS CALLED AIRPODS. SO, INSTEAD OF SPENDING SEVEN MINUTES UNTANGLING YOUR HEADPHONES, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO AVOID WORKING OUT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FORGET IT. THAT'S RIGHT. THEY'RE REPLACING EAR BUDS WITH AIRPODS. HERE, TAKE A LOOK. AND I ALREADY LOST THEM. OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHERE -- AIRPODS. I HAVE ONE. I HAVE ONE POD. AIRPOD. THESE WIRELESS BUDS WILL EASILY FIT IN YOUR EAR AND JUST AS EASILY ROLL UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT WHERE YOU'LL NEVER, EVER SEE THEM AGAIN. [ APPLAUSE ] CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT? HERE'S THE LATEST ON THE ELECTION, YOU GUYS. DONALD TRUMP JUST REVEALED THAT HE'S NOT PRACTICING FOR THE UPCOMING DEBATES IN A A TRADITIONAL WAY, AND HAS NOT BEEN USING A STAND-IN FOR HILLARY. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY TODAY I SAW TRUMP AT ANN TAYLOR LOFT YELLING AT A MANNEQUIN. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS LIKE, "THAT SWEATER SET ISN'T VERY PRESIDENTIAL. [ LAUGHTER ] SAD! IT'S SAD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S REALLY SAD." AND GET THIS. HILLARY SAID YESTERDAY THERE'S SO MUCH SPECULATION ABOUT HER, SHE'S PROBABLY CREATED A LOT OF JOBS AT THE, QUOTE, "CONSPIRACY THEORY FACTORY." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN CONSPIRACY THEORISTS WERE LIKE, "I KNEW THERE WAS A A FACTORY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IS IT BEHIND LINCOLN'S FACE ON MT. RUSHMORE?" BUT HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS FOR HILLARY, TODAY STARBUCKS CEO HOWARD SCHULTZ SAID HE'S ENDORSING HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT. WELL, ACTUALLY, WHAT HE SAID WAS, "I HAVE AN ENDORSEMENT FOR -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HILARITY? HILLB -- HILLAMBEE? HILLAMBEE?" LISTEN TO THIS, YOU GUYS. THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTS THAT THE OBAMAS COULD MAKE $45 MILLION FROM BOOK DEALS AFTER LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE PRESIDENT'S ALREADY GOT ONE BOOK FINISHED, IT'S CALLED "ARE YOU THERE, GOLF? IT'S ME, BARACK." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE ALREADY WROTE IT. WORKING ON A SEQUEL --
Steve: HE ALREADY WROTE IT?
Jimmy: WORKING ON A SEQUEL ALREADY. AND JESSICA ALBA'S HONEST COMPANY IS SELLING BIPARTISAN DIAPERS, FEATURING THE DEMOCRATIC DONKEY AND THE REPUBLICAN ELEPHANT HOLDING HANDS. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE BASICALLY FULL OF THE SAME THING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, IT JUST MAKES SENSE. "SAD!" THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. I SAW THAT LIBRARY IN ALABAMA IS WARNING CUSTOMERS THAT FAILING TO RETURN A BOOK ON TIME COULD RESULT IN 30 DAYS IN JAIL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO, IF ANYONE ASKS WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR, LIE. [ LAUGHTER ] "WELL, SNAKE -- WELL, SNAKE, IT'S THE DARNEDEST THING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I AM HERE BECAUSE I -- TRIPLE MURDER. [ LAUGHTER ] I -- OH, BOY." THAT'S RIGHT. FAILING TO RETURN A BOOK ON TIME COULD RESULT IN 30 DAYS IN JAIL. SO REMEMBER, KIDS, IF YOU WANT TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE, DON'T READ. THERE YOU GO. THAT'S GOOD ADVICE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO. HEY, GET THIS, YOU GUYS. A NEW STUDY FINDS THAT HAVING SEX LATER IN LIFE CAN HELP WOMEN'S HEALTH, BUT CAN DOUBLE THE RISK OF OLDER MEN HAVING A A HEART ATTACK. OR AS WOMEN CALL THAT, "A WIN-WIN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I HAVE FUN AND GET RID OF THIS OLD SNORE MACHINE? LET'S DO IT!" WELL, GUYS, LAST NIGHT WAS THE SEASON FINALE OF "BACHELOR IN PARADISE." [ SCATTERED CHEERS ] THE SHOW ALREADY ANNOUNCED THAT ONE OF THE GUYS, NICK VIALL, WAS GOING TO BE THE NEXT BACHELOR. RIGHT? SO IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THINGS WEREN'T GOING TO WORK OUT FOR HIM LAST NIGHT. BUT LISTEN TO HOW HE BROKE UP WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND ON THE SHOW. I'M NOT SURE HIS EXPLANATION MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.
I KNOW, LIKE, I'M A BETTER PERSON TODAY THAN I WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SHOWED UP, BECAUSE OF YOU. I -- I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO SAY I WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU, BUT JUST SOMETHING IN MY HEART JUST SAID I CAN'T. AND I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, YOU WISH YOU COULD TELL YOUR HEART WHAT TO DO. AND IF I COULD, I WOULD -- I WOULD TELL IT TO CHOOSE YOU.
Jimmy: OH, PLEASE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] COME ON. "I WANT MY HEART TO LOVE YOU, BUT THEN THEY OFFERED TO MAKE ME THE NEW BACHELOR, SO I TOLD MY HEART TO CHOOSE THAT INSTEAD -- INSTEAD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS." THOSE WEREN'T WAVES IN THE BACKGROUND, THAT WAS THE OCEAN THROWING UP. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GUYS, WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT.

YOU KNOW, THE QUOTE IS USUALLY BY SOMEONE FAMOUS, LIKE AN ACTOR, A POLITICIAN, OR A A HISTORICAL FIGURE. I LOVE READING THEM, BUT SOMETIMES I'LL READ ONE AND SAY, "DID THEY REALLY SAY THAT?"

Steve: SOUNDS LIKE HIM.
Jimmy: HERE'S ANOTHER ONE FROM MR. SANDBURG. HE SAID, "THE FIRST 'DIEHARD' IS THE BEST 'DIEHARD'. THE THIRD 'DIEHARD' IS THE SECOND BEST 'DIEHARD'. SECOND WOULD BE THE THIRD BEST. THEN IT PRETTY MUCH WENT DOWN HILL FROM THERE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DOES THAT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING HE WOULD SAY?

AND SO WE BASICALLY, WITHIN THE STRUCTURE OF THIS FILM, ARE THE PORTAL TO THE FLASHBACKS, WHICH TELL THE WHOLE STORY OF SNOWDEN FROM THE BEGINNING AND GIVE, YOU KNOW, A REALLY GOOD SENSE OF WHAT MOTIVATED HIM TO MAKE THIS DECISION AND IT ILLUMINATED IT FOR ME. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I KNEW ABOUT THE STORY.
Jimmy: YEAH, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SEE HIM AS A TRAITOR, AND SOME PEOPLE SEE HIM AS A A PATRIOT, A WHISTLEBLOWER.
YEAH, AND WHAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND REALLY UNTIL I WORKED ON THE MOVIE WAS THAT HE -- HIS WHOLE LIFE, REALLY, WAS GEARED TOWARD SERVING HIS COUNTRY. HE TRIED TO BE IN THE MILITARY, BUT HE INJURED HIMSELF AND WASN'T ABLE TO, AND THAT'S WHAT LED HIM TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. SO, YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY KNOW WHO HE IS AND KIND OF HAVE VILIFIED HIM, I ENCOURAGE THEM TO SEE THIS MOVIE, BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES PAINT A FULLER PICTURE THAN EVEN I UNDERSTOOD IT. IT'S REALLY COOL.
Jimmy: DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT HACKING OR --
OH, MAN. I LEARNED TO PUT SOME TAPE ON THE LAPTOP CAMERA AND TO, YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: REALLY?
I MEAN, IT'S SO EASY ,AND WHEN YOU REALLY READ THE DOCUMENTS --
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I KNOW THE CAMERA ON THE LEFT --
YOU SHOULD HAVE TAPE ON THAT. SOMEONE COULD BE WATCHING US RIGHT NOW. NOT KIDDING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING. THIS IS "THE TONIGHT SHOW," MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. TELEVISION CAMERAS. PUT TAPE OVER ALL THE CAMERAS. I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE WHOLE TIME?
WAIT WE'RE ON TV?
Jimmy: I GOT A HACKER! PUT THIS OVER HERE. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WE DON'T HAVE -- STOP WATCHING US! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. I TOLD SOMEBODY AT THE NETWORK, I SAID, SOMEBODY'S GOING TO WATCH THIS SHOW ONE DAY, AND YOU'LL SEE. WE'RE GOING TO GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.
I WALKED RIGHT INTO THAT ONE.
Jimmy: NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. BUT -- I'M SORRY. THE LAPTOP THING -- YOU DO COVER IT UP?
TOUCHE.
Jimmy: YEAH I KNOW, SORRY.
NO, YEAH. I MEAN I DIDN'T BEFORE, BUT WHEN YOU REALLY READ, LIKE, I READ ALL THESE DOCUMENTS. GLENN WROTE A BOOK CALLED "NO PLACE TO HIDE," WHICH CHRONICLES THEIR TIME IN HONG KONG LEADING UP TO MAKING THIS DECISION TO RELEASE ALL THIS INFORMATION, AND ALSO THEN GOES INTO THE SPECIFICS OF THE DOCUMENTS. AND JUST WHEN YOU REALIZE HOW SWEEPING AND --
Jimmy: EASY IT IS.
--UNTARGETED THESE INTRUSIONS INTO OUR PRIVACY REALLY WERE, IT JUST MAKES YOU AWARE. I WALK A FINE LINE BECAUSE I'M NOT A PARANOID PERSON. I DON'T WANT TO BE A PARANOID PERSON.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT I DO FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, PART OF WHAT THIS ISSUE ALLOWS US AS AMERICANS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IS OUR OWN CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY, AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S AT THE HEART OF THIS DEBATE. SO I THINK IN AN ELECTION YEAR, IT'S A REALLY GOOD TIME TO KIND OF BRUSH UP ON YOUR SNOWDEN AND FIGURE OUT, YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU STAND ON AN ISSUE THAT WILL AFFECT US FOR YEARS TO COME, BECAUSE ONLINE PRIVACY AND, YOU KNOW, CYBER SPACE IS KIND OF THE NEXT FRONTIER OF GOVERNMENT AND UNFORTUNATELY, OF WARFARE.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. HERE'S ZACHARY QUINTO IN "SNOWDEN." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
TELL US, DID THE WHITE HOUSE MAKE ANY SPECIFIC CLAIMS ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY THAT WOULD PREVENT YOU FROM PUBLISHING?
YES, I ASKED THEM REPEATEDLY AND THEY HAD NO --
THEN THERE YOU GO. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT? YOU CAN GO OUT AND KNOW THAT YOU'RE SAFE.
GLENN, I'D LIKE TO TALK TO ALAN BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER.
WHEN DOES HE LAND?
IN SIX HOURS.
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT. WE'RE SITTING DUCKS HERE, JANINE. IT'S 1:00 P.M. IN NEW YORK. IF YOU DON'T GET THIS OUT IN THE NEXT FOUR HOURS, YOU'LL MISS THE EVENING NEWS ON THE EAST COAST.
BUT WE CAN POST LATER TONIGHT. I'M SORRY, GLENN, BUT ALAN'S OUR EDITOR IN CHIEF, AND I  --
[ BLEEP ] THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS THAT WE HAVE THESE DOCUMENTS NOW. THE CIA COULD BARGE THROUGH THIS DOOR ANY MINUTE AND YOU WANT MORE TIME.
I HAVE TO GO.
ACT LIKE A [ BLEEP ] JOURNALIST, AND STOP STRINGING US ALONG.
Jimmy: YEAH. LOOKING GOOD. YOU'RE AWESOME, BUDDY. ZACHARY QUINTO, EVERYBODY. "SNOWDEN" HITS THEATERS FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16th. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH DIRECTOR JAMES CAMERON. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU GET.
Jimmy: LOOK AT THIS SHOW.
AND YOU GET A SHOW.
Jimmy: OH, YOU GET, OF COURSE, A SHOW, YEAH. LOOK, EVEN JUST THE MAKEUP AND THE SET. AS I GO INTO THIS, THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
IT'S SPECTACULARLY COLORFUL. I CAN BRAG ON IT ALL DAY LONG BECAUSE I DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE IT. YOU KNOW, THEY CAME TO ME, THE CIRQUE GUYS CAME TO ME AND --
Jimmy: HOW DID THEY -- HOW DID YOU GET IN TOUCH WITH -- WHERE DID YOU RUN INTO THE CIRQUE GUYS? YOU HANG OUT IN THE SAME BARS?
ACTUALLY, WHEN I WAS MAKING "AVATAR" I CALLED THEM UP AND I SAID, HEY, YOU GOTTA CHECK OUT THIS 3-D TECHNOLOGY, I WANT TO SHOOT YOUR SHOWS. AND I WOUND UP DOING THAT AND I MADE A FILM WITH THEM.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
AND THEN AS A RESULT OF THAT CONVERSATION, THEY SAID, HEY, WE WANT TO TAKE "AVATAR" AND DO A SHOW, LIKE AN HONEST TO GOD CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHOW. I THOUGHT THAT WAS -- I WAS IN HEAVEN. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW YOU'VE ARRIVED. WHEN YOU GET A CIRQUE SHOW.
Jimmy: WHEN CIRQUE DU SOLEIL --
YOU'LL FIND OUT.
Jimmy: YEAH, "THE TONIGHT SHOW" -- [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, YEAH. BUT IF THEY'RE WATCHING WE HANG OUT IN THE SAME CIRCLES. BUT I'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHOWS AND THEY'RE JUST PHENOMENAL. YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE HOW -- THEY'RE CONTORTIONISTS.
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS OVER YOUR HEAD. THEY'RE FLIPPING AROUND.
Jimmy: THINGS THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW ARE PEOPLE TURN OUT TO BE PEOPLE. SERIOUSLY THE WALLS START MOVING AND YOU'RE LIKE, THAT WAS AMAZING. A GUY WAS STANDING LIKE THAT. AND BALANCING.
THEY'RE SO INVENTIVE.
Jimmy: IT REALLY IS.
THAT'S WHY I LOVE WORKING WITH THEM.
Jimmy: THIS THING NOW, IT'S GOT WHAT IS IT, 40 SOMETHING PROJECTIONS?
YEAH.
Jimmy: REAR PROJECTION CAMERAS OR?
THEY GO INTO A STADIUM, THEY GO IN A DAY AHEAD OF TIME, WITH 27 TRUCKS. AND THEY TURN IT INTO PANDORA. SO THEY'RE DOING IT WITH PROJECTIONS AND THEY CAN DO LAVA, RIVERS, JUNGLES, ALL THAT STUFF. AND THEN THEY PUT 40 ACTORS, PLAYERS, GYMNASTS ALL THAT, IT'S A HUGE SHOW. IT'S PURE PAGEANTRY. IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.
Jimmy: THIS IS A PERFECT THING FOR YOU, BECAUSE THIS IS JUST -- I THINK IT'S YOUR IMAGINATION, YOU'RE DOING FOUR MORE "AVATARS."
YEAH.
Jimmy: WRITING THEM. FOUR.
YEAH. WELL, I'VE WRITTEN THREE. I'M HALFWAY THROUGH NUMBER FIVE AT THIS POINT. THE FOURTH SEQUEL.
Jimmy: WOW. THAT'S BUSY. YEAH. I MEAN, FOR YOUR --
NOT BUSY LIKE YOU, LIKE EVERY NIGHT COMING --
Jimmy: NO ONE'S WATCHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, THEY ARE.
Jimmy: ON A LAPTOP. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. GOODBYE, YEAH. MY DAD.
NSA BUDDIES. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I WAS FACETIMING WITH MY DAD. WHAT IS "TORUK" ABOUT? IF YOU GO SEE IT.
WELL, IT'S LIKE A PREQUEL. IT TAKES PLACE A THOUSAND YEARS IN THE PAST OF THE MOVIE AND BEFORE HUMANS GOT THERE BECAUSE THE NA'VI ARE LIKE TEN FEET TALL SO ALL THESE GYMNASTIC PERFORMERS ARE LIKE 5'6", RIGHT SO THEY'RE -- SO YOU HAVE TO SET YOUR BRAIN FOR NA'VI SCALE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, WHEN YOU WATCH THE SHOW.
Jimmy: SURE.
SO THEY SET IT BACK WAY IN THE PAST. I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL ANYTHING. BUT THERE'S A TORUK, WHICH IS THE BIG ORANGE KIND OF, FIREBIRD THAT'S IN THE MOVIE. THEY DO IT WITH LIKE A 40 FOOT WINGSPAN. IT'S PHENOMENAL.
Jimmy: REALLY? GET OUT. I'M ASSUMING YOU BRING KIDS TO SEE THIS?
OH IT'S -- WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD. EVERYBODY BECOMES A KID AT A A CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHOW.
Jimmy: IT'S MIND BLOWING.
