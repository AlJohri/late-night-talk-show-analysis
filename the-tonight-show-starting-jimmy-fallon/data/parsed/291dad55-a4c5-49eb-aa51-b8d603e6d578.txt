I HAD NO IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ] A NEW POLL FOUND THAT MOST REPUBLICAN VOTERS NOW THINK TRUMP IS THEIR PARTY'S BEST SHOT AT WINNING THE GENERAL ELECTION.

SHE LOVED IT.
Jimmy: AND SHE'S FANTASTIC. WE LOVE HER SO MUCH. HI, BRYCE. TELL HER I SAID HI. BUT SHE TOLD ME THIS MOVE THAT YOU DID THAT'S SUCH A DAD MOVE. I'M SO PSYCHED ABOUT IT.
WHAT WAS IT?
Jimmy: OH, THIS IS FANTASTIC. YOU DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE YOU DID IT, IT'S SO GOOD. SO YOU TWEETED OUT THIS PICTURE. YOU SAID, "BRYCE AND CHRIS MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE RED CARPET. THEY WILL BE CO-STARS IN THE NEXT 'JURASSIC.'"
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT NICE? YOU'RE PROUD.
YEAH. IT WAS THE GOLDEN GLOBES. "RUSH" WAS NOMINATED, AND I WAS SO EXCITED AND I WAS SO PROUD.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I'M SO EXCITED FOR HER, YOU KNOW, AS HER DAD.
Jimmy: HERE'S THE THING, THOUGH. IT HADN'T BEEN ANNOUNCED YET THEY'RE IN THE MOVIE. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE SAID EVERYBODY FREAKED OUT.
I BET.
Jimmy: IMAGINE OTHER ACTORS THINKING THEY'RE UP FOR THE ROLE. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, HONESTLY --
SHE CALLED ME. SHE CALLED ME. SHE SAID, DAD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON TWITTER? THAT'S MY VICE. GET OFF TWITTER, DAD.
DON'T SHOOT ME. I'M PROUD.
Jimmy: I JUST THINK IT'S SUCH A DAD MOVE. I LOVE THAT YOU DID IT. GOSH, I HAD TO DO IT IN FRONT OF YOU WHILE YOU'RE HERE. IT MADE ME LAUGH. LET'S TALK ABOUT "IN THE HEART OF THE SEA." THIS IS, THIS NEW MOVIE, I'M GOING TO CALL IT THE WHALE MOVIE.
OH, SURE. WHY NOT?
Jimmy: BECAUSE IT'S A GIANT, GIANT, GIANT, I'M ASSUMING CGI WHALE.
IT'S A CGI WHALE, BUT THAT IS THE SIZE OF THE REAL WHALE. AND SORT OF THE THING THAT DREW ME INTO IT TO BEGIN WITH IS THAT MOBY DICK WAS INSPIRED BY A REAL EVENT. SO THAT WHALE THAT HE WROTE ABOUT EXISTED, AND THIS IS THE ACTUAL STORY OF THE EVENT THAT INSPIRED MELVILLE. SO THERE WAS A WHALE THAT SIZE, THAT SCALE, WHO ATTACKED THE SHIP. BUT IT'S NOT THE MOB DICK STORY, BECAUSE THEIR OWN STORY IS, YOU KNOW, IT'S PERSONAL. IT'S HEROIC, IT'S EMOTIONAL.
Jimmy: THEY'RE SURVIVING. I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU DO? SO, ONCE THE WHALE DOES THAT, THIS GIANT -- WELL, THEY'RE HUNTING FOR A A WHALE.
WELL, THEY ARE WHALERS. THAT WAS THE ENERGY INDUSTRY OF ITS TIME. SO THEY'RE GOING OUT THERE AND, YOU KNOW, ENCROACHED ON THAT WHALE --
Jimmy: THIS IS LIKE "JAWS" TIMES TEN. LIKE A GIANT, GIANT SHARK BUT IT'S A WHALE.
I ALWAYS SAY WELL, HE'S NOT REALLY LIKE A SHARK --
Jimmy: I'M EXPLAINING TO PEOPLE WHAT A WHALE IS. IT'S DIFFERENT THAN A SHARK, RIGHT?
IT HAS A DIFFERENT MENTALITY.
Jimmy: YEAH, DIFFERENT MENTALITY. WHALES ARE DIFFERENT THAN SHARKS.
I SAY HE'S MORE LIKE KING KONG.
Jimmy: OKAY.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, MAN ENCROACHED ON THE WRONG DUDE.
Jimmy: YES.
DON'T MESS WITH HIM.
Jimmy: DON'T MESS WITH MOTHER NATURE, YEAH. HE LIVES HERE. YOU JUST MESSED WITH THE WRONG DUDE.
AND SO TO HIS WHALE BRETHREN.
Jimmy: YEAH OKAY, GOOD. OF COURSE, I LOVE YOU AS A A DIRECTOR AND I ALSO LIKE YOU AS A PERSON, BUT YOU DO THESE THINGS THAT I HEAR STORIES ABOUT, BECAUSE PEOPLE COME ON THE SHOW, I GO, "HOW ARE THEY AS A DIRECTOR?" PEOPLE LOVE WORKING WITH YOU. THEY LOVE THE CAMARADERIE, THE SOLIDARITY WITH YOUR CREW. I REMEMBER THE STORY, JIM CARREY WAS DOING "THE GRINCH," AND HE HAD THIS AWESOME HAIR AND MAKEUP.
TOOK HIM FOREVER, THREE AND A HALF HOURS.
Jimmy: EVERY DAY TO GET INTO THE GRINCH COSTUME. AND HE WAS GOING CRAZY. BECAUSE AFTER A WHILE, YOU GO, "I WANT THIS OFF. I GOT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM."
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THAT SOLIDARITY, YOU GOT HAIR AND MAKEUP AND DIRECTED ONE DAY AS THE GRINCH.
I WENT IN HAIR AT 3:30, JUST TO HAVE ONE DAY OF SUFFERING WITH HIM.
Jimmy: I JUST LOVE THAT YOU DO STUFF LIKE THAT, AND HONESTLY, IT MEANS A LOT. YOU'RE A GREAT MAN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. THIS IS A CLIP OF "IN THE HEART OF THE SEA." HERE'S CHRIS HEMSWORTH AND THE SHIP'S CREW ENCOUNTERING ONE VERY ANGRY WHALE.
