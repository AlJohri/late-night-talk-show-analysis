Jimmy: YEAH, BUT YOU ACTUALLY ARE RAD. UH, NOW UH, I SAW THIS MOVIE "HORNS" IS VERY COOL. UH, NOW IN THE MOVIE, YOU DO A A GREAT AMERICAN ACCENT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S FANTAS -- YOU DO A FANTASTIC AMERICAN ACCENT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: AND I WAS JUST THINKING LIKE, HOW HARD IT WOULD BE BECAUSE WHEN I DO A A BRITISH ACCENT, IT'S JUST VERY, VERY HARD.
IT IS, THE BRITISH ACCENT IS A HARD ACCENT. IT'S VERY HARD, SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO IT, SOMETIMES -- BUT THAT'S THE THING YOU, YOU DO WHAT? UH, MOST AMERICANS DECIDE TO GO EITHER TO GO SORT OF COCKNEY, OR VERY POSH. AND YOU'VE GONE COCKNEY, WHICH IS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IS THAT REAL? OR IS THAT FAKE?
YEAH, I REALLY TALK LIKE THIS.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.

YOU DO A BIT OF AN ACCENT AND GO, IS THAT OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THERE'S ACTING FOR YOU. YOUR ACCENT, THOUGH, YOUR AMERICAN ACCENT IS AMERICAN ALL THE WAY IN THIS FILM. AND I READ SOMEWHERE THAT YOU LEARNED AMERICAN ACCENTS FROM WWF OR WWE. FROM WRESTLERS.
YEAH, WELL THAT -- YEAH. YEAH, YOU SHOULD SEE HOW I TALK IN THE FILM. IT'S VERY DRAMATIC ALL THE TIME.

THAT'S -- I DON'T THINK YOU EVEN NEED TO SEE THE MOVIE NOW.
Jimmy: EXACTY, YEAH.
NO BUT BASICALLY --.
Jimmy: IT'S SO HOT IN HERE.
WWF, AS IT WAS THEN, WAS ONE OF MY, LIKE MANY AMERICAN CULTURAL INFLUENCES IN THE U.K. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP ALONG WITH OTHER STUFF LIKE "FRIENDS" AND "FRASIER." AND JUST -- WHEN YOU HEARD AMERICAN ACCENTS ALL THE TIME IN ENGLAND. SO, IT'S VERY, YOU SORT OF GROW UP DOING IT. LIKE WHEN I RECREATED ROYAL RUMBLES WITH LIKE WWF ACTION FIGURES, I GAVE THEM THE APPROPRIATE ACCENTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THEY WERE NEVER HITTING EACH OTHER.

Jimmy: YOU AND THE ROCK?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, LIKE THAT WOULD BE --
Jimmy: WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. HE WATCHES THE SHOW.
DOES HE? HE KNOWS I'M A FAN, BECAUSE I'VE HAD FRIENDS -- WHO HAVE -- LIKE MUTUAL FRIENDS WHO'VE ADDRESSED HIM ON OTHER FILMS AND STUFF, SO. I ACTUALLY HAVE A T-SHIRT WHICH ONE OF THEM GOT HIM TO MAKE ME. UH, WHICH HIS UM -- WELL, THEY MADE IT, HE TOOK THE PICTURE. THEY WEREN'T LIKE "MAKE THIS, DWAYNE."
Jimmy: FORCE HIM TO SEW A A T-SHIRT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S KINDA WEIRD.
UM, BUT NO, IT'S JUST A A T-SHIRT WITH A PICTURE OF HIM HOLDING UP A SIGN SAYING DAN RADCLIFFE, NUMBER ONE FAN. WHICH I HAVE, LIKE I HAVE THAT. THAT'S A THING I HAVE IN MY LIFE.
Jimmy: WHAT WOULD BE THE SHOW? WHAT WOULD BE THE FILM? LET'S COME UP WITH THE IDEA. WHAT'S THE IDEA FOR THIS FILM?
WELL, I MY INITIAL THOUGHT WAS A BUDDY COP MOVIE. UM, ABOUT TWO KIND OF LIKE UNLIKELY PARTNERS WHO OFCOURSE FORCED TO WORK TOGETHER. AND THEN ARE BONDED BY LIKE -- THIS CAME OUT OF ANOTHER IDEA THAT ME AND A FRIEND WERE HAVING ONE NIGHT WHERE WE WERE JUST COMING UP WITH BAD PUN NAMES FOR FILMS. AND WE DECIDED A BUDDY COP MOVIE ABOUT TWO COPS THAT ARE JOINED OVER THEIR LOVE OF MUSIC. SHOULD BE CALLED SIREN SONG. AND SO WE PITCHED THAT.
Jimmy: MUSICAL COPS.
YEAH, IT'S NOT A MUSICAL MOVIE. BUT THEY'RE BOTH LIKE "AH MAN, I LOVE THIS MUSIC SO MUCH." AND THEY'RE LIKE "AH, I DIDN'T LIKE YOU, BUT ACTUALLY, WE HAVE THE SAME TASTE IN THIS."
Jimmy: THAT GOES ON FOR TWO HOURS.
ESSENTIALLY. YEAH TWO HOURS OF THAT.
Jimmy: I LIKE IT.
BUT WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SEE ME AND THE ROCK DO THAT?
Jimmy: HOW ABOUT "ROCK AND RADCLIFFE."
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S CALLED "ROCK AND RADCLIFFE." THAT'S ALSO THE NAME OF THE MOVIE.
OK, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: SO IT'S ROCK AND RADCLIFFE IN "ROCK AND RADCLIFFE." AND YOU'RE TWO COMPETING BEACH BANDS, LIKE AN ELVIS MOVIE, UNDER A CLIFF, AND LIKE A CLAM BAKE. AND YOU'RE TWO COMPETING BANDS, AND THEN YOU, AND YOU GET TOGETHER TO FORM ONE BAND CALLED ROCK AND RADCLIFFE.
OH YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT AS BEING EXCELLENT.
Jimmy: SIREN SONGS, OR BETTER YET --.
I DUNNO, I'M GOING WITH ROCK AND -- IF EITHER OF THOSE FILMS GET MADE -- IF YOU'RE WATCHING, AND YOU WANT TO MAKE EITHER OF THOSE FILMS --
Jimmy: I GET 10%.
YES.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY. YEAH, THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I MADE A LOT OF MONEY TONIGHT.
WE'VE BEEN PRODUCTIVE ALREADY.
Jimmy: VERY PRODUCTIVE TONIGHT. LET'S EXPLAIN WHAT "HORNS" IS ABOUT. IF YOU NEED -- IF YOU WANT A HALLOWEEN FILM TO WATCH. IT'S A VERY -- I WOULD SAY -- IT'S A THINKING MOVIE ON TOP OF BEING A LITTLE SCARY.
YEAH, I MEAN, IT IS A HORROR MOVIE. AND IT HAS HORROR ELEMENTS TO IT. BUT IT'S ALSO VERY FUNNY. YOU CAN'T MAKE A FILM ABOUT A A GUY WHO GROWS HORNS WITHOUT HAVING A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: HE GROWS HORNS OUT OF HIS HEAD?
HE GROWS HORNS OUT OF HIS HEAD. BASICALLY, A VERY, VERY SHORT SUMMARY OF THE PLOT. MY GIRLFRIEND IN THE MOVIE HAS BEEN MURDERED AND THE WHOLE TOWN THINKS THAT I'VE DONE IT. ONE NIGHT, AFTER A NIGHT OF DEBAUCHERY, I WAKE UP WITH KIND OF THE BEGINNING OF DEVIL'S HORNS GROWING OUT OF MY HEAD. THEY EMERGE AND I SUDDENLY REALIZE THAT THEY ARE MAKING PEOPLE CONFESS STUFF TO ME. SO I REALIZE I CAN USE THEM TO FIGURE OUT WHO KILLED MY GIRLFRIEND, AND ALSO FIGURE OUT WHY I'M NOW BECOMING THE DEVIL. IT'S CRAZY, IT'S WILD, IT'S FUNNY. IT'S A LOT OF FUN.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S GOOD. WE HAVE A CLIP HERE WHERE THERE'S A BUNCH OF REPORTERS TRYING TO GET THE FIRST INTERVIEW. TRYING TO GET YOU TO TALK TO THE CAMERAS.
OH, YEAH, AND IT'S PROBABLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW FOR THIS THAT THE HORNS HAVE SORT OF LET ME MAKE PEOPLE DO WHAT I WANT. IMPORTANT INFORMATION.
Jimmy: YEAH. VERY GOOD. HERE'S A CLIP OF DANIEL RADCLIFFE IN "HORNS." CHECK IT OUT.
