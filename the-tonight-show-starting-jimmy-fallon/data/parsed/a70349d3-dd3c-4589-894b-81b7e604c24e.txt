Jimmy: OH, HELLO, EVERYBODY. HI! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HOT CROWD HERE IN NEW YORK CITY TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOT SHOW. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS FUN. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. I SAW THAT TRUMP TOWER IN CHICAGO WAS STRUCK BY LIGHTNING -- -- DURING THE ILLINOIS PRIMARY -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] -- WHICH DONALD TRUMP WENT ON TO WIN. YEAH, NOBODY WAS HURT. WHILE GOD WAS LIKE, "CRAP, I MISSED." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. TRUMP TOWER IN CHICAGO WAS STRUCK BY LIGHTNING DURING THE ILLINOIS PRIMARY. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, BUT LONG STORY SHORT, DONALD TRUMP HAS SWITCHED BODIES WITH AN 11-YEAR-OLD BOY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S FINE. "WE'RE HAVING ICE CREAM FOR BREAKFAST." [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF TRUMP, HE RECENTLY SAID THAT IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT HE'LL FORCE APPLE TO START MAKING ITS PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S GREAT NEWS FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PAY $20,000 FOR AN iPHONE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] GOOD IDEA. AND THE PRESIDENT OF CNN REJECTED CLAIMS THAT THE NETWORK HAS GIVEN DONALD TRUMP TOO MUCH ATTENTION, AND SAID HE FEELS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RISE OF DONALD TRUMP. MAKES SENSE. JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE MENTIONS TRUMP A LOT ON TV DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HE DOES IF HE'S PRESIDENT.
DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP. IT'S HUUUUGE! [ CHEERS ]

I'M GONNA BE DOING A A FUNDRAISER WITH AND FOR SENATOR CRUZ. I THINK HE'S THE BEST ALTERNATIVE TO DONALD TRUMP. HE'S CERTAINLY NOT MY PREFERENCE, SENATOR CRUZ IS NOT, BUT HE'S A RELIABLE REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE WITH WHICH I'VE HAD MANY DIFFERENCES WITH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "I THINK HE'S A REAL JERK AND ANNOYING AND -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- IT'S A SHAME HE WAS EVER BORN. AND I JUST NEED A REALLY GIANT FROZEN MARGARITA RIGHT NOW." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ALSO CLAIMS TED CRUZ'S NEW SLOGAN, "TED CRUZ, ALL YOU GOT LEFT." [ LAUGHTER ] THERE YOU GO. [ APPLAUSE ] NOT BAD.
Steve: NOT BAD SLOGAN.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, MARCH MADNESS IS IN FULL SWING. AND YALE PULLED OFF A MAJOR UPSET IN THE FIRST ROUND YESTERDAY BY BEATING BAYLOR. AND AFTER THE GAME REPORTERS TRIED TO GET ONE OF THE BAYLOR PLAYERS TO EXPLAIN HOW YALE COULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE REBOUNDS. LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
HOW DOES YALE OUTREBOUND BAYLOR?
YOU GO UP AND GRAB THE BALL OFF THE RIM WHEN IT COMES OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN YOU GRAB IT WITH TWO HANDS, AND YOU COME DOWN WITH IT. AND THAT'S CONSIDERED A A REBOUND. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THEY GOT MORE OF THOSE THAN WE DID. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

NEXT, EASTER CELEBRATES THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS. NOR'EASTER CELEBRATES THE RESURRECTION OF THE SHOVEL YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T NEED AGAIN FOR NINE MONTHS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "HONEY, WHERE DID WE PUT THAT THING?" AND FINALLY ON EASTER, YOU CONSIDER EATING BRUNCH WITH YOUR FAMILY. IN A NOR'EASTER, YOU CONSIDER EATING YOUR FAMILY FOR BRUNCH.
