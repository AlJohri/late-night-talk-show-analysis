GUYS, THERE ARE NOW ABOUT SIX MORE WEEKS LEFT IN THE ELECTION. AND WE KNOW THAT, BECAUSE THIS MORNING TRUMP'S HAIR POPPED OUT AND SAW HIS SHADOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT USUALLY MEANS --
Steve: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. WOW.
Jimmy: THAT USUALLY MEANS -- ACTUALLY THE SECOND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IS JUST 11 DAYS AWAY. AND THIS ONE WILL HAVE A TOWN HALL FORMAT. THE FIRST QUESTION WILL BE, "WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DO THIS IN OUR TOWN?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "CAN YOU DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE?" AND GET THIS, IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT AMERICANS WILL BE ABLE TO SUBMIT QUESTIONS ONLINE FOR THE NEXT DEBATE. WHEN RUSSIAN HACKERS HEARD THIS, THEY WERE LIKE, "THAT'S RIGHT, THE AMERICANS WILL BE SUBMITTING THE QUESTIONS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. THE DUST IS STILL SETTLING FROM MONDAY'S DEBATE, WHICH WOUND UP BEING THE MOST WATCHED DEBATE IN U.S. HISTORY. IN FACT, I READ THAT DISNEY HOSTED A VIEWING PARTY FOR JOURNALISTS AT A HOTEL IN LOS ANGELES. YEAH, AND SEVERAL DISNEY CHARACTERS ACTUALLY SHARED THE ISSUES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM THIS ELECTION. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: CHIP AND DALE SAID, "SAME-SEX MARRIAGE." THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TORTURING THEMSELVES. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] VERY INTERESTING TIMES WE LIVE IN. I SAW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLED IN TO RYAN SEACREST'S RADIO SHOW YESTERDAY TO ENCOURAGE LISTENERS TO VOTE. YEAH. EVEN THOUGH HE'S THE BUSIEST PERSON ON THE PLANET, HE MADE THE TIME TO TAKE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CALL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I THOUGHT THAT WAS NICE OF RYAN SEACREST TO DO. THIS WAS VERY INTERESTING, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S UPCOMING SOUTH BY SOUTH LAWN FESTIVAL AT THE WHITE HOUSE WILL HAVE A A VIRTUAL REALITY, PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN A SMALL JAIL CELL. OR AS OBAMA CALLS IT, THE OVAL OFFICE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS. YESTERDAY A GROUP OF DEMOCRATIC SENATORS SENT A LETTER TO YAHOO! ASKING WHY THEY TOOK SO LONG TO REPORT THE HACKS OF 500 MILLION USERS. THAT'S HOW LITTLE FAITH THEY HAVE IN YAHOO! E-MAIL, THEY SENT A LETTER TO YAHOO! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] FINALLY, A LITTLE SPORTS NEWS HERE. TOM BRADY IS ON THE LAST WEEK OF HIS NFL SUSPENSION, AND HE WAS PHOTOGRAPHED IN ITALY TANNING NAKED. [ CHEERS ] YEAH.

NOW IT'S IMPORTANT YOU DON'T TELL THEM WHAT THE ACTUAL MOVIE IS ABOUT. JUST HAVE THEM WRITE A SHORT SCENE, ONE OR TWO PAGES WITH TWO CHARACTERS TALKING TO EACH OTHER. JUST GIVE THEM THE TITLE "THE ACCOUNTANT" AND LET THEIR IMAGINATION DO THE REST. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHEN THEY'RE DONE, JUST TAKE A A PHOTO OF THEIR SCRIPT OR SCAN IT AND EMAIL IT KIDTHEATER@TONIGHTSHOW.COM. WE'RE GOING TO CHOOSE OUR FAVORITES AND BEN AND I WILL ACT THEM OUT ON THE SHOW. IT'S GONNA BE REALLY FUN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "KID THEATER."

BECAUSE THAT'S ON MY WAY TO WORK. I LIVE ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THE STUDIOS I USE ARE IN HELL'S KITCHEN, THREE LITTLE STUDIOS, AND EVERY DAY I WOULD STOP AT THIS INTERSECTION BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC IS BUSY.
Jimmy: OH, SURE, YEAH.

Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE HELL'S KITCHEN. I KNOW HELL'S KITCHEN FAIRLY WELL. IT IS -- IT'S KIND OF THAT ONE SECTION OF NEW YORK THAT'S NOT REALLY DEVELOPED YET. LIKE OVERDEVELOPED.

Jimmy: HOW DOES STING GO ABOUT COMING UP WITH A NEW ALBUM? DO YOU HAVE A PILE OF SONGS? YOU'RE LIKE, "HMM, I DO THIS ONE, NOW." IT'S LIKE PICKING OUT CLOTHES?
NORMALLY, YEAH. BUT THIS ONE, I HAD NOTHING. I CALLED MY MUSICIANS UP, DOMINIC MILLER ON GUITER, VINNIE COLAIUTA ON THE DRUMS. I COME TO THE STUDIO. I'VE GOT NOTHING. SO THEN, THE THREE OF US PLAYED LIKE THE MIDDLE OF PING PONG, THREE-WAY PING PONG.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IDEAS COME, AND THEN WE'VE SHED THEM INTO A SONG FORM. THEN I GO FOR MY WALK BACK HOME OVER 57th AND 9th. I THINK OF WHAT THE MUSIC IS TELLING ME.
Jimmy: "WHAT DON'T YOU WRITE ROXANNE, MAN! HOW'S ROXANNE DOIN' MAN?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU'RE LIKE, UGH, I JUST WROTE A SONG. IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH "ROXANNE." SHUT UP! LEAVE ME ALONE!" [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO IF I WERE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT YOU, YEAH, YEAH.

Jimmy: YEAH.
I DON'T LIKE NOT WORKING.
Jimmy: BUT DO YOU THINK WHEN YOU DO THESE SONGS, YOU GO, "I'M GONNA PLAY THIS FOR 50,000 PEOPLE, 100,000 PEOPLE?" OR DO YOU GO, "I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I GOT TO GET IT OUT OF BRAIN," OR "I'M DOING IT FOR ME," OR --
I REALLY PLAY FOR MY BAND, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH.
I WANT US TO ENJOY MAKING MUSIC TOGETHER, SO THEY'RE THE FIRST PORT OF CALL, THEN I PLAY IT TO TRUDIE AT HOME.

I KNOW A FEW. BUT THE REST, I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: SOMEONE DOES HAVE YOUR EMMY.
AND THEN LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WISH THERE WAS A A PLATE OF SPAGHETTI NEXT TO THAT. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC.
THE EMMY PARTIED HARDER THAN I DID THAT NIGHT.

I THINK THAT MIGHT BE MY MANAGER'S SON. I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: SOMEBODY HAS YOUR EMMY, AND THEY'RE TAKING GOOD CARE OF IT.
YES. BUT, YOU KNOW, HAVE AN ADVENTURE.
Jimmy: YOU'RE TALKING TO THE EMMY?
YES. COME BACK TO ME WHEN YOU FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE. MY EMMY COULD BE LIKE FORREST GUMP AND WIND UP IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERY HISTORICAL EVENT FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS AND IT WILL COME BACK TO ME AND IT WILL BE BEAUTIFUL.

IF YOU LOVE SOMEBODY, SET THEM FREE.

Jimmy: OH, COME ON! FIRST OF ALL, THE FACT THAT HE CAN SPEAK ENGLISH IS SOMETHING. YOU SHOULD BE PSYCHED. WHAT DID KATE McKINNON DO BEFORE YOU GOT "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"? YOU'VE GOT SOME ODD JOBS. CAN YOU JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THEM. I KNOW YOU WERE A TELEMARKETER AT ONE POINT.
I WAS A TELEMARKETER FOR S.A.T. CLASSES AT ONE POINT.
Jimmy: THAT IS A TOUGH -- THAT'S A TOUGH JOB IN GENERAL I CAN TELL 'CAUSE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO HEAR FROM A A TELEMARKETER.
NO AN ESPECIALLY, I'M NOT GOOD AT SELLING THINGS. AND SO, I WOULD JUST GO LIKE, HI, I'M CALLING FROM THE COMPANY, AND JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU MIGHT WANT THIS. BUT IF YOU DON'T, THAT'S FINE. I WILL GET OFF THE PHONE. I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT YOUR AFTERNOON. I CAN HEAR IN YOUR VOICE THAT YOU DON'T WANT IT. SO, OKAY, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. BYE.

YES, IT'S SORT OF A BANK HEIST GONE HILARIOUSLY WRONG. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I PLAY ZACK GALIFIANAKIS' FIANCéE WHO IS BASED ON A A REAL -- SO LOOSELY BASED -- EVERYONE IN THE MOVIE IS SO LOOSELY BASED ON REAL PEOPLE. BUT I THINK, I GUESS IN THE SCRIPT HER NAME WAS KAREN. AND I SAID TO THE DIRECTOR, JARED HESS, HOW ABOUT WE NAME HER JAUNDICE? AND HE WAS LIKE, LET'S DO A A COMPROMISE. WE MET IN THE MIDDLE AT JANDICE AND SO --

SO HOW'D YA'LL MEET?
I'M A SUCKER FOR COURTSHIP STORIES.
WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW, A A COUPLE YEARS BACK I WAS AT A A YOUTH PRAISE CONCERT AT CHURCH. AND I SAW THE MOST HANDSOME MAN THAT I'D EVER SEEN IN THE WORLD. HE WAS LOOKING RIGHT AT ME. WE WENT ON A DATE, AND THEN WE FELL VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY DEEPLY IN LOVE. AND THEN HE DIED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SNAKE BITE. AT HIS FUNERAL, I WAS VERY, VERY DISTRAUGHT. I COULDN'T KEEP MYSELF TOGETHER. AND I SAW THIS OTHER MAN, A A DISTANT COUSIN OF THE DECEASED. HE WAS THE HE WAS THE PALLBEARER, AND HE WAS KIND OF STRUGGLING TO HOLD UP HIS END OF THE CASKET.
I HAD A HARD TIME LIFTING IT UP.
