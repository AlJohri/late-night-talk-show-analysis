AND OVER THE WEEKEND VLADIMIR PUTIN ORDERED FIREWORKS TO GO OFF IN MOSCOW TO CELEBRATE CRIMEA JOINING RUSSIA. AND ALSO THE FACT THAT HE HAD STANFORD BEATING KANSAS IN HIS MARCH MADNESS -- [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT? IT'S SO GREAT. YOU HAVE TO LIGHT FIREWORKS WITH THE -- THAT'S RIGHT. PUTIN ORDERED FIREWORKS TO GO OFF IN MOSCOW. EITHER THAT OR ONE OF PUTIN'S RIVALS TRIED TO START HIS CAR. [ LAUGHTER ] BORIS WAS GIVING US BIG SHOW TO SAY THANK YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE'S WEIGHING IN ON THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE. IN A NEW INTERVIEW, MITT ROMNEY CRITICIZED PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR BEING NAIVE, UNPREPARED AND USING BAD JUDGMENTS. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WHICH IS ALSO HOW PEOPLE DESCRIBE ROMNEY WHEN HE'S BUYING JEANS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ IMITATING ROMNEY ] "DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING WITH PLEATS? ANYTHING HERE AT ALL WITH PLEATS? LIKE A DRESS JEAN. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE A DRESS JEAN THAT -- FORGET IT. JUST BUY THE PLACE OUT AND I'LL LOOK THROUGH IT LATER." [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT? BUT OBAMA HAS OTHER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT. TODAY HE WAS IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR A NUCLEAR SUMMIT WITH 50 OTHER WORLD LEADERS. NOT SAYING OBAMA'S UNPOPULAR RIGHT NOW, BUT EVERY TIME HE PUTS DOWN HIS TRAY IN THE CAFETERIA, ALL THE OTHER LEADERS MOVE TO ANOTHER TABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] C'MON BULLIES! BULLIES. [ APPLAUSE ] FORGET IT. I'LL SIT WITH YOU -- NO, I DON'T WANT TO SIT WITH YOU. AND GET THIS, VLADIMIR PUTIN DIDN'T EVEN ATTEND THAT NUCLEAR CONFERENCE. YEAH. HE SENT HIS FOREIGN MINISTER IN HIS PLACE. I GUESS HE SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO VISIT ANY COUNTRY HE CAN'T KEEP. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT INTERESTED. AND THIS IS PRETTY COOL. I SAW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL TRAVEL TO THE VATICAN THIS WEEK TO MEET WITH POPE FRANCIS FOR THE FIRST TIME. YEAH. NOW, WHEN MEETING THE POPE, IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP CERTAIN THINGS IN MIND. SO HERE ARE SOME DO'S AND DON'TS THAT SHOULD HELP. ♪♪ [ APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: FIRST, DO TALK TO HIM ABOUT SERIOUS RELIGIOUS ISSUES. DON'T ASK HIM IF GOD REALLY SOUNDS LIKE MORGAN FREEMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST DON'T GET INVOLVED. DO ASK HIM HOW TO BE A BETTER PERSON.

Steve: OH, MY GOD.
Jimmy: STARTING TO GROW ON ME A LITTLE BIT. I LIKE IT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. IT'S SO COOL, YEAH. AND FINALLY, DO ADMIRE THE POPE'S HAT. DON'T TELL HIM PHARRELL'S HAT IS WAY COOLER. [ APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, HE DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.
Steve: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
Jimmy: BECAUSE IT'S LARGER.
Steve: NO NEED.
Jimmy: OF COURSE THE OTHER BIG STORY IS MARCH MADNESS. THERE WERE A TON OF BIG UPSETS. EVERYONE'S BRACKET IS RUINED, RIGHT? YEAH. I SAW THE ANSWER THIS WEEKEND. THERE ARE NO WINNERS IN WARREN BUFFETT'S BILLION DOLLAR MARCH MADNESS CHALLENGE. BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, WARREN'S KIDS ARE SPEAKING TO HIM AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE ALL THE MONEY TO SOME PERSON WHO'S A A GOOD GUESSER? AND NOT US? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT MAKES SENSE. THANKS, DAD.
Steve: YEAH. THIS IS COOL. THIS IS MY FAVORITE RIDE. I HEARD THAT THIS YEAR MARKED THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF DISNEY'S "IT'S A SMALL WORLD" RIDE. I LOVE "IT'S A SMALL WORLD." YEAH. THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING SOME CHANGES TO IT, THOUGH. I HEARD THEY ARE MAKING THE RUSSIAN SECTION MUCH, MUCH LARGER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY ARE WE STUCK BY CRIMEA THE WHOLE TIME, MOMMY? I DON'T KNOW. JUST WAVE AT THE LITTLE TROOPS AND WE'LL BE GOOD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT.

Jimmy: THAT'S NOT HOW LANDO DANCES. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, EDWARD SNOWDEN IS IN THE NEWS AGAIN. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GUY. NOW, INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ARE ACCUSING SNOWDEN OF HELPING THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT GET AROUND NSA SURVEILLANCE. SNOWDEN SAID, "LOOK, WHAT I DO WITH MY COMPUTER ON MY TIME WITH YOUR INFORMATION IS NOBODY'S BUSINESS BUT MINE, OKAY? [ APPLAUSE ] WE COOL?" SPEAKING OF THE NSA, THIS IS PRETTY INTERESTING. IN A NEW INTERVIEW, FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER SAID HE THINKS THE NSA IS READING HIS EMAILS. THEN HE LOOKED AT HIS GRANDKIDS AND SAID, "WELL, AT LEAST SOMEBODY IS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE AWS ] GRANDPA JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU HOW HE GROWS PEANUTS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T WANT TO READ GRANDPA'S EMAILS. I'M FINE, I'M GOING TO BE FINE. THIS IS JUST WEIRD HERE. AN OFFICIAL IN NEW JERSEY JUST ADMITTED TO STEALING $460,000 IN QUARTERS FROM A A STATE STORAGE FACILITY. YEAH, HE WAS SENTENCED TO ONE YEAR OF DOING EVERYONE'S LAUNDRY. [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE LIKE THAT ARE JUST GOING TO BRING THE COUNTRY DOWN. [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ] HERE'S A CRAZY STORY. THERE WERE NO INJURIES ON SATURDAY WHEN THREE ELEPHANTS BRIEFLY ESCAPED FROM A CIRCUS IN MISSOURI. WHEN I HEARD THAT I WAS LIKE, "THERE WEREN'T ANY CLOWNS THAT GOT LOOSE, WERE THERE? [ LAUGHTER ] THEN IT GETS REAL SCARY."

Jimmy: WE GOT A HOT SHOW. WE'VE GOT A HOT WEEK AHEAD. I HAD KIND OF A STRESSFUL DAY YESTERDAY. I WENT OUT WITH MY WIFE AND MY BABY. WE WERE DRIVING AROUND. AND WE WERE DRIVING -- DROVE TO THIS BEACH IN THE HAMPTONS. IT WAS LIKE A BEACH, JUST TO LOOK AT THE OCEAN OR WHATEVER. AND I GO TO MY WIFE -- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC BECAUSE I THINK YOU CAN DRIVE ON THE BEACH AFTER 6:00. AND I GOT ONE OF THE CARS THAT ARE LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER -- EARTH ROVER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. EARTH -- WHATEVER. YOU CAN DRIVE ANYWHERE. I'VE SEEN COMMERCIALS WHERE THEY DRIVE UP ROCKS. AND THE GUY'S GOT ALL THESE LOGS IN THE DRIVEWAY, AND HE DRIVES UP. SO I GO, THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING TO THIS. THERE'S A DIAL YOU CAN TURN AND THERE'S THE CAR, AND IT'S NEXT TO A CACTUS. I'M ASSUMING SAND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: CACTUS --
Jimmy: YOU'RE IN ARIZONA? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. BUT I TURNED IT AROUND. I GO, "WHAT DO YOU SAY WE JUST DRIVE ON THE BEACH?" MY WIFE IS LIKE, I GUESS. I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY STEEP HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN DRIVE THIS THING THERE. I'M LIKE, "HONEY, WHO CARES? ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST DO IT." SO SHE GOES, "I DON'T KNOW." SO I JUST FIGURED I'D MAKE THE MANLY THING AND LET'S JUST TAKE OFF. PUT IT IN SAND. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR A SECOND I THINK THE CAR FLASHED "NO." [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, TRUST ME. SO I'M DRIVING IN THE SAND AND IT'S JUST AWFUL. I'M HYDROPLANING ON THE SAND. AND I'M TRYING NOT TO ACT NOT NERVOUS. THE BABY'S MOBILE IS GOING LIKE -- SHE LOVES IT. SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD DO THAT WITH THE MOBILE. SHE'S LIKE, THIS IS AWESOME. AND THEN I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT. I JUST GOT TO FIGURE THIS OUT." SO I GO, "OKAY, HONEY, I THINK THIS WAS FUN. WE HAD ENOUGH. THIS IS ROMANTIC." THERE'S SWEAT COMING DOWN MY FACE. I GO, "I'M JUST GOING TO GO RIGHT UP TO THE NEXT WAY I CAN GET OFF THE BEACH ONTO THE THING." I GO UP THIS GIANT HILL AND -- [ IMITATES ENGINE ] AND MY WIFE GOES, "YOU KNOW, THE MORE YOU KEEP DOING THAT, THE MORE YOU'RE GOING TO GET STUCK." I GO, "ALL RIGHT. OKAY, WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?" I MEAN, I HAVE NOTHING. SO I GO -- [ IMITATES ENGINE ] AND I FEEL US JUST GETTING LOWER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I TOTALLY -- I TOTALLY GOT STUCK IN THE SAND. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] LIKE PULLING -- THAT'S ON THE HIGHEST SUSPENSION. THAT'S TOUCHING THE GROUND. AND I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE COOL. OF COURSE, THERE'S NO OTHER CARS TRAPPED IN THE SAND BECAUSE I'M AN IDIOT.
Steve: NO ONE ELSE IS DRIVING.
Jimmy: I'M AN IDIOT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I'M THE ONLY -- SO, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I CALLED 911. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I HAD NO IDEA. GUY WAS LIKE, "DON'T CALL 911, YOU IDIOT. YOU CALL A TOW TRUCKING COMPANY." I'M LIKE, "I'M SO SORRY." I FELT STUPID, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHO TO CALL. SO I JUST ENDED UP GETTING SOME TOW COMPANY. THIS GUY'S NAMED -- OH, WE DON'T HAVE TO SHOW THE NUMBER OR ANYTHING. BUT IT'S A COMEDY NAME. HAMMER TOWING. [ LAUGHTER ] I SWEAR.

AND HE CAME UP AND HE LOOKED AT US AND GOES, "UH, YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T PARK THERE." [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS A GOOD OPENING JOKE. BUT ANYWAY, THANK YOU, ELIJAH, FOR SAVING ME OUT OF THAT SAND. I WON'T DO IT AGAIN! I PROMISE! [ APPLAUSE ] WE GOT A FUN, FUN SHOW TONIGHT. [ IMITATING SCHWARZENEGGER ] "HE'S A BIG TIME ACTION STAR. HE'S THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA."

Jimmy: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS. I WAS JUST SHAKING MY HEAD BACK THERE IN THE GREEN ROOM. I SAID, "WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?" "WHAT'S HE DOING WITH THIS RED CAR?" I MEAN THE COLOR ALONE ALREADY IS DANGEROUS. [ LAUGHTER ] I GO TO THE BEACH WITH MY FAMILY WHEN YOU HAVE A BABY THERE THAT MEANS SAFETY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU GOT TO GO WITH A CAR THAT HAS 45-INCH TIRES AND GO YOU GO OUT THERE 4-WHEEL DRIVE.
Jimmy: I DON'T WANT TO DRIVE A MONSTER TRUCK AROUND THE BEACH.
BUT YOU'RE SAFE.
Jimmy: I WOULD KEEP MY BABY IN THE BACK OF GRAVE DIGGER? AND THEN LIKE DRIVING AROUND LIKE MONSTER TRUCK?
HANGING ON THE CEILING, BOUNCING AROUND.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT SAFE AT ALL. TO BE HONEST WE WERE SAFE BECAUSE WE WEREN'T MOVING ANYWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE JUST KIND OF NESTLED IN THE SAND LIKE OSTRICH EGGS.
WHAT IF THE WATER RISES?
Jimmy: I WAS AFRAID OF THAT, BY THE WAY. THE TIDE CAME IN. I MEAN I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT WOULD GIVE ME TRACTION TO GET OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] I REALLY I HAD NO THOUGHTS. IT WAS JUST AWFUL.
I CAN TELL YOU HAVE NOT DONE ANY ACTION MOVIES. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] OTHERWISE YOU WOULD KNOW THOSE THINGS.
Jimmy: LAST TIME I SAW YOU, YOU TAUGHT ME TO MAN UP A A LITTLE BIT. YOU TAUGHT ME ABOUT CIGARS AND WHAT GOOD CIGARS TO HAVE. WE WENT TO --
HAVANA ROOM.
Jimmy: A CLUB. HAVANA ROOM. SOME SECRET CLUB AND I DIDN'T KNOW EVEN THAT WE WERE UNDERGROUND. WE'RE UNDER LIKE SIX LAYERS OF EARTH. ALMOST WHERE MY CAR ENDED UP. I COULD HAVE MET YOU THERE. WE WERE IN AN UNDER GROUND BUNKER. WE WERE SITTING THERE, JUST SMOKING CIGARS AND YOU TELL ME -- YOU SAID, "NO YOU DON'T -- STOP LIGHTING. STOP LIGHTING IT! YOU LIT IT ALREADY." YOU WERE YELLING AT ME. [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT I SAW PEOPLE TURN -- THEY USE TO ROTATE THE CIGAR AROUND. I'VE SEEN THAT IN MOVIES AND YOU GO, "YOU LIT IT! STOP LIGHTING IT! IT'S LIT!" [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL BECAUSE YOUR SLEEVE WAS ON FIRE.
Jimmy: WELL I DIDN'T KNOW MY SLEEVE WAS ON FIRE. SOMETHING WAS BURNING ME.
I REMEMBER YOU KEPT SUCKING ON IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WAS NOT DOING THAT! THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO.
I SAID, "BE CALM. JUST PULL BACK. LET IT COOL." I SAID --I SAID, "PUT IT BETWEEN YOUR TEETH."
Jimmy: ALRIGHT.
THEN JUST LIKE THIS, JUST NICE AND SLOW. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE ASHES -- THE ASHES WILL GLOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: LET'S JUST LET THE MEMORY BE WHAT IT IS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
LET THEM KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND DOORS.
Jimmy: THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU PICKED IT UP.
Jimmy: YEAH.
EVEN THOUGH YOU SAID, "I'M LITTLE DIZZY NOW." ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: I DON'T WANNA TELL EVERYBODY WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN HERE.
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT. WELL, YOU DO STUFF THAT I GO, "I WOULD NEVER IN MY LIFE DREAM ABOUT." HERE'S ONE THING THAT YOU'RE DOING NOW. I JUST LOVE THIS. YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR CHARITY. YOU TAKE YOU'RE TANK. YOU OWN A TANK.
RIGHT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS A REAL PHOTO. AND YOU JUST DRIVE IT AND CRUSH OVER -- YOU JUST DRIVE IT OVER THINGS AND CRUSH THINGS.
THAT'S RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY NOT?
Jimmy: BEST THING IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. THEN I THOUGHT, "I COULD NEVER GET A TANK. HOW DID YOU GET A TANK?"
THIS WAS THE VERY TANK I ACTUALLY DROVE IN THE AUSTRIAN ARMY. WHEN I WAS 18 YEARS OLD I WENT IN THE AUSTRIAN ARMY AND I BECAME A TANK DRIVER. AND THEN YEARS AND YEARS LATER, DECADES LATER, I SAID TO MYSELF, "WELL NOW THEY DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE." IT'S A PATTON TANK THAT AMERICA GAVE AUSTRIA AFTER IT BECAME A A NEUTRAL COUNTRY AFTER 1955. AND SO I DROVE THE TANK AND WE HAD 500 OF THOSE TANKS. BUT THEN THEY BECAME OBSOLETE. SO I ASKED THE AUSTRIAN ARMY IF I CAN HAVE IT BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] IF I CAN HAVE MY TANK THAT I DROVE EXACTLY WITH THAT NUMBER. I HAD TO GET PERMISSION FROM THE AUSTRAIN -- FROM THE AMERICAN -- THE PENTAGON AND FROM THE MILITARY AND ALL OF THOSE KIND OF THINGS WHICH WAS EASY TO GET FOR ME BECAUSE I WAS THEN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PRESIDENT COUNSEL AND FITNESS CENTER. I KNEW VERY WELL DICK CHENEY AND COLIN POWELL AND THOSE GUYS. THEY GOT ME THE PERMISSION AND THE AUSTRIAN ARMY SENT ME THE TANK. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ONLY YOU COULD GET A A TANK.
AND NOW -- I MEAN NOW WE'RE USING IT LIKE FOR FUNDRAISING, YOU KNOW? I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WHICH I'VE BEEN DOING NATIONWIDE FOR THE LAST 20 SOME YEARS. AND YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS NEED MONEY FOR IT SO WE CAN ENROLL MORE KIDS IN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND HERE WE HAVE FOUND A WAY OF JUST HAVING PEOPLE PARTICIPATE AND PAY. WE RAISED THROUGH THIS FUNDRAISER OVER A MILLION DOLLARS FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND FOR KIDS --
Jimmy: OH MY GOD.
TO JOIN AND GET THEM OFF THE STREETS. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU GO ON YOUTUBE, YOU CAN SEE THESE VIDEOS.
THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S ARE REALLY, REALLY FUN. IT'S LIKE, YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH." CAUSE LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A KID YOU JUST WANT TO CRUSH THINGS, AND DRIVE TRUCKS AND TANKS. BUT YOU NEVER THOUGHT IT COULD REALLY HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE AND YOU'RE DOING IT.
YOU GET INTO REAL TROUBLE ALSO I CAN TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS 18 YEARS OLD AND I STARTED AS A A TANK DRIVER. WE MADE MISTAKES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL LIKE HOW? LIKE I WOULD TOTALLY LOVE --YOU COULD DRIVE PRETTY FAST IN THESE THINGS RIGHT?
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE SPEED. IT'S 35 MILES AN HOUR, 40 MILES AN HOUR AT THE MOST. BUT I REMEMBER ONE TIME WE WERE ON MANEUVER. IT WAS 12:00 MIDNIGHT. AND SO WE BROKE FOR LUNCH -- WHAT THEY CALL LUNCH EVEN THOUGH IT WAS AT MIDNIGHT. BUT WE DECIDED, MY FRIEND WHO HAD THE TANK, AN M-60 NEXT TO ME WHICH WAS A MODERNIZED TANK. SO I SAID TO HIM, I SAID, "LET'S SEE WHO'S FASTER DOWN THIS HILL." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND SO WE TOOK OFF. AND WE DROVE DOWN THIS HILL AT LEAST 40 MILES AN HOUR.
Jimmy: YOU PUT CLICK INTO HILL MODE. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. PUT IT INTO HILL MODE.
JUST DOWNHILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. WE DIDN'T SEE WHERE WE WERE GOING. WE'RE JUST CRASHING THROUGH TREES AND BUSHES AND EVERYTHING. BUT BY THE TIME WE CAME DOWN TO THE BOTTOM, I BEAT HIM EVEN THOUGH HE HAD THE MORE MODERN TANK. BUT I REALIZED THE WHOLE INFANTRY, 15 GUYS THAT WERE STANDING ON TOP OF THE TANK, I TOTALLY FORGOT TO TELL THEM TO GET OFF THE TANK. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THEY WERE JUST HOLDING ON AND THEN THEY WERE FALLING OFF. I HEARD THE SCREAMS THE WHOLE TIME. [ SCREAMING ] I SAID, "WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?" AND ALL THOSE GUYS WERE FALLING OFF. BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE BOTTOM THERE WAS NO ONE ON THE TANK ANYMORE. I WAS IN THE TANK. AND THEN OF COURSE, WHEN WE CAME BACK --
Jimmy: YOU KIND OF -- YOU'RE LIKE, "I WON."
WE WERE PUNISHED.
Jimmy: OH YEAH.
WE HAD THE TO CRAWL UNDER THE TANK IN THE MUD. IT WAS LIKE THICK MUD. WE HAD TO CRAWL UNDER THE TANK, UP ON TOP OF THE TANK, UP INTO THE TURRET, DOWN THE BOTTOM, OUT AGAIN, UNDERNEATH THE TANK. WE DID THIS 50 TIMES. I TELL YA, WHEN YOU GET FULL OF MUD, YOU CAN'T MOVE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE --AFTER 25 TIMES I COULDN'T MOVE ANYMORE. IT TOOK ME FROM 12:00 MIDNIGHT TO 6:00 IN THE MORNING TO DO THIS 50 REPS. TO DO THE WHOLE THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I WAS SO EXHAUSTED, I SLEPT FOR 24 HOURS AFTER THAT. THOSE ARE THE KIND OF PUNISHMENT THEY WILL GIVE YOU IN THE ARMY FOR MAKING THIS KIND OF --
Jimmy: MAKING A MISTAKE, YEAH. SAME WITH ME ALMOST. I HAD ABOUT MAYBE A POUND AND A A HALF OF SAND IN MY SHOES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS WALKING AND MY SHOES -- I COULD BARELY LIFT MY LEGS. I WAS LIKE -- I SLEPT FOR 20 MORE HOURS.
HOW MANY MORE TIMES DO WE HAVE TO SEE THE RED CAR?
Jimmy: HELP ME! I'M CRUSHED. I'M CRYING. HELP ME!
YOU NEEDED THE TANK. YOU NEEDED THE TANK.
Jimmy: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- SO YOU NEEDED THE TANK. FIRST OF ALL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN YOUR NEW MOVIE. I LOVE THIS. IF YOU LOVE ACTION FILMS, YOU WANT TO SEE COOL GUNS, COOL EQUIPMENT, EXPLOSIONS, IT'S JUST FUN. IT'S "SABOTAGE." IT'S OUT THIS FRIDAY. IT'S YOU --GREAT CAST OF PEOPLE. SAM WORTHINGTON FROM "AVATAR," MIREILLE ENOS FROM "THE KILLING." I LOVE HER. SHE'S AWESOME. TERRENCE HOWARD IS IN IT. DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS? I KNOW YOU'RE IN THE D.E.A.
WELL YEAH, THE D.E.A IS REALLY THE TOP TASK FORCE. IT WAS A TASK FORCE. WE ARE PART OF, YOU KNOW, A A GROUP THAT INFILTRATES INTO A A DRUG CARTELS. DRUG ORGANIZATIONS. AND IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS JOB, BUT EVENTUALLY, YOU KNOW, THE WORK BACKFIRES. AND, BUT IT IS AN ACTION HERO THAT IS CROSSING THE LINE HIMSELF TOO MANY TIMES.
