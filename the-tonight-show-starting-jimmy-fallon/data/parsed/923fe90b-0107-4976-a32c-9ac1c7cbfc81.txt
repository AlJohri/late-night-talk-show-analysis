Questlove: 346, HOUSTON!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, WOW! THAT IS TOO NICE! THAT IS MUCH, MUCH TOO NICE. WELCOME. I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. YOU LOOK GOOD. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I APPRECIATE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOT CROWD. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. YOU GUYS, WE HAVE MICHAEL FASSBENDER ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GREAT. FANTASTIC ACTOR. HE'S PLAYING STEVE JOBS IN THE NEW BIOPIC. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. WE ALSO HAVE CEELO GREEN ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHO, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IS ALSO PLAYING STEVE JOBS IN ANOTHER BIOPIC. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY KEEP PUTTING THEM OUT. IT'S FANTASTIC. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE, YOU GUYS. THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT IS REALLY STARTING TO GET COMPETITIVE HERE. AND DONALD TRUMP RECENTLY SAID THAT HE'S ACTUALLY GETTING READY TO AIR HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN ADS. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] EVEN THE GEICO LIZARD WAS LIKE, "I THINK WE ALREADY SEE ENOUGH OF YOU ON TV, MATE." [ LAUGHTER ] "I'M JUST SAYING, YOU COULD JUST GIVE IT A BREAK FOR A A LITTLE BIT." HILLARY CLINTON CONTINUES TO DISTANCE HERSELF FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. IN FACT, HILLARY JUST CAME OUT AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP TRADE AGREEMENT. ALSO KNOWN AS THE TPP. WHICH IS WEIRD, BECAUSE WHEN OBAMA ASKED HILLARY IF SHE WAS TOWN WITH TPP, SHE SAID, "YEAH, YOU KNOW ME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND NOW SHE'S SAYING A FLIP, FLOP, THE FLIPPY TO THE FLIPPITY, FLIP, FLIP, FLIP, FLOP, YOU DON'T STOP -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GUYS, THIS STORY COMES FROM THE "NATIONAL ENQUIRER" SO TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE EVERYTHING I READ IN IT, BUT YOU MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS. BUT, THEY'RE SAYING THAT REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE BEN CARSON MADE A NUMBER OF SERIOUS MISTAKES AS A NEUROSURGEON AND EVEN LEFT A SPONGE IN ONE PATIENT'S BRAIN. WHEN ASKED HOW IT AFFECTED HIS LIFE, THE PATIENT WAS LIKE -- [ TRUMP IMPRESSION ] "IT'S FINE, I'M STILL RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I DON'T CARE. EVERYTHING'S GREAT. IT'S GONNA BE HUGE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I THOUGHT THIS WAS A LITTLE SURPRISING HERE. A NEW REPORT FOUND THAT DEPORTATIONS IN THE U.S. ARE THE LOWEST THEY'VE BEEN SINCE 2006. WHEN THEY HEARD THAT, IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS WERE LIKE, "GET OUT OF HERE. NO, I MEAN -- NO, NOT YOU. STAY. STAY. BUT JUST -- WOW, WOW. NO, DON'T GET OUT OF HERE." AND THIS GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE'S ATTENTION. AIRBUS, WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PLANE MANUFACTURERS IN THE WORLD, THEY JUST FILED A A PATENT FOR A NEW SEAT DESIGN IN WHICH PASSENGERS WOULD BE STACKED ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER. I'M NOT -- THIS IS A REAL THING. THIS IS THE DRAWING. THIS IS THE PATENT. YOU SEE THIS? [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS REAL. THEY'RE GOING TO START PUTTING PEOPLE ABOVE PEOPLE.
Steve: NO.
Jimmy: WHICH IT SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL IDEA.
Steve: AWFUL.
Jimmy: BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO SEE THE -- IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE. LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER DESIGNS THAT WE GOT OUR HANDS ON. THEY COULD HAVE WENT WITH THIS ONE, "THE BATMAN."
Steve: IT'S HORRIBLE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, YOU FIT MORE PEOPLE BUT YOU'RE UPSIDE-DOWN IN THE WHOLE FLIGHT.
Steve: IT'S AWFUL, YEAH. IT'S RIDICULOUS.
Jimmy: FITS MORE PEOPLE. YEAH. ALSO COULD HAVE GONE WITH "THE INTERVENTION." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: JUST UNCOMFORTABLE.
Jimmy: FINALLY "THE TETRIS" COULD HAVE BEEN FUN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FITS A LOT MORE PEOPLE. THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN. I WOULD DO THAT ONE. THAT ONE'S PRETTY GOOD. DID YOU HEAR THIS? I HEARD THAT CHANEL HAS BUILT AN ENTIRE FAKE AIRPORT FOR ITS FASHION SHOW AT PARIS FASHION WEEK. YEAH, WHICH IS PRETTY COOL. UNLESS YOU'RE THE FAMILY THAT'S RUNNING LATE AND JUST GOT DROPPED OFF AT A FAKE AIRPORT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE LIKE, "WHY IS EVERYONE AT THIS AIRPORT DRESSED LIKE LADY GAGA? WHAT'S GOING ON? WHERE'S OUR GATE?" THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY, YOU GUYS. I SAW THAT THE HARVARD DEBATE TEAM RECENTLY LOST A DEBATE TO A GROUP OF PRISON INMATES HERE IN NEW YORK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] PRETTY SURPRISING. AFTERWARD, BOTH SIDES HAD SOME THEORIES ON WHAT HAPPENED. HERE'S WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. FIRST THE HARVARD DEBATE CAPTAIN SAID, "WELL THE ART OF DEBATE IS A FASCINATING THING AND IN A TRADITIONAL-OXFORD STYLE FORMAT, IT MAY DEFEND ON MORE COMPLEX FACTORS THAN NEARLY THE OBJECTIVE FACTS." THEN THE PRISON DEBATE CAPTAIN SAID, "I FLINCHED AND THE KID PEED HIS PANTS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LISTEN TO THIS, GUYS. TWO THIEVES IN PORTLAND, OREGON, STOLE A TRUCK FROM A A NATURAL FOODS COMPANY THIS WEEK AND GOT AWAY WITH ALL THE TOFU THAT WAS BEING TRANSPORTED INSIDE. POLICE DESCRIBED THE THIEVES AS ARMED AND EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. [ LAUGHTER ] "DUDE, TOFU? YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME, MAN." NEXT MONTH OHIO WILL OFFICIALLY VOTE ON WHETHER IT SHOULD LEGALIZE MARIJUANA, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S AT LEAST ONE GUY IN OHIO WHO STILL MIGHT WANT TO LAY OFF IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
POLICE IN YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO, SAY THEY WERE CALLED TO A HOME BY A MAN WHO COMPLAINED TO THEM THAT HE'D GOTTEN TOO HIGH SMOKING MARIJUANA. OFFICERS SAY THEY FOUND THE 22-YEAR-OLD MAN CURLED UP IN THE FETAL POSITION ON THE FLOOR GROANING AND SURROUNDED BY SNACKS -- DORITOS, GOLDFISH CRACKERS, AND CHIPS AHOY COOKIES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SURROUNDED BY SNACKS. YEAH.
Steve: SURROUNDED.
Jimmy: WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED. THAT GUY DOESN'T NEED THE COPS, HE NEEDS A GLASS OF MILK. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ALL HE NEEDS, YEAH. IT GOT WORSE WHEN THE GUY KEPT ASKING THE COPS IF THEY WERE THE COPS. HE'S LIKE "ARE YOU A COP?" "YEAH, YOU CALLED US." "YOU HAVE TO TELL ME, DUDE, SERIOUSLY." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "I AM." "STOP MESSING WITH ME, MAN. ARE YOU?" AND FINALLY, I HEARD 6,000 PRISONERS ARE SET TO BE RELEASED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN THE LARGEST ONE-TIME PRISON RELEASE IN U.S. HISTORY. YEAH, WHEN REACHED FOR COMMENT ONE OF THE PRISONERS SAID, "THAT'S GREAT, I HAVE A FRIEND FROM HARVARD I WANT TO VISIT." [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, YOU GUYS. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, RIGHT THERE. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

AND THEN WE REALIZE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE ARE. AND WE'RE STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. IT'S SNOWING IN RHODE ISLAND. AND WE'RE SITTING IN THIS DEAD SUBURBAN STREET GOING, "HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS?"
