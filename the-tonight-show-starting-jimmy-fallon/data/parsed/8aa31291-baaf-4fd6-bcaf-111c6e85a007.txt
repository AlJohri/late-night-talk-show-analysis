Questlove: 498.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: PLEASE ENJOY YOURSELF. WELCOME. WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR THE LOVE. THANK YOU FOR THE ENERGY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU ARE HERE. YOU MADE IT. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU GUYS. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. GUYS, LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS. BIG ELECTION NEWS. TODAY, BERNIE SANDERS OFFICIALLY ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON AT A RALLY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S BIG NEWS. HILLARY SAID SHE'S GLAD BERNIE IS BEHIND HER 100%, AND BERNIE SAID, "LET'S JUST START OFF WITH 1%." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] BERNIE SANDERS GAVE A SPEECH WHERE HE ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON EFFECTIVELY ENDING HIS CAMPAIGN. WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHAT HE'LL DO NEXT, BERNIE WAS LIKE, LIVE MY DREAM AND BE A CONTESTANT ON "THE BACHELORETTE." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M COMING FOR YOU, JO-JO. I THINK IT'S LOVE. I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: I GOT THAT FEELING THE FIRST TIME I STEPPED OUT OF THE LIMOUSINE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LOVE THAT SHOW. BEFORE GIVING HIS ENDORSEMENT, BERNIE SANDERS NOTED THAT HILLARY ONLY HAS 389 MORE PLEDGED DELEGATES THAN HIM GOING INTO THE CONVENTION. BUT HE SAID, "BUT I, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE 400 MORE POKEMON." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO WHO'S THE REAL WINNER? I'M THE WINNER. [ APPLAUSE ] BUT PEOPLE ARE STILL HAMMERING THE CLINTONS ABOUT THEIR PAST. IN FACT, "THE L.A. TIMES" JUST REVEALED THAT BILL CLINTON HAS DEMANDED PRIVATE JETS TO GET TO SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS. IN THEIR DEFENSE, BILL AND HILLARY NEED PRIVATE JETS, BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONLY PLANES THAT CAN FIT ALL OFF THEIR BAGGAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY FILL UP THE OVERHEADS WITH JUST THE 90'S.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: AND "THE WASHINGTON TIMES" NOW REPORTING THAT INDIANA GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE HAS A 95% CHANCE OF BEING DONALD TRUMP'S PICK FOR VICE PRESIDENT. I'M NOT SAYING CHRIS CHRISTIE'S UPSET, BUT HE WAS LAST SEEN AT THE TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING SWATTING AT PLANES. [ LAUGHTER ] [ NOISES ]
Jimmy: BUT GET THIS YESTERDAY TRUMP ACTUALLY SAID THAT HIS VICE PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE WON'T MATTER, BECAUSE THAT PERSON NEVER REALLY WINDS UP HELPING A A CANDIDATE ANY WAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO USE THOSE EXACT SAME WORDS WHEN INTRODUCING HIS RUNNING MATE AT THE CONVENTION, HE'S GONNA BE LIKE, "THIS NEXT PERSON WILL BE A FOOTNOTE IN HISTORY AT BEST." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] PLEASE WELCOME WHAT'S HIS FACE. THIS IS PRETTY FUNNY. APPARENTLY OVER IN CHINA, THE OFFICIAL STATE MEDIA HAS BEEN LABELING DONALD TRUMP AS "A CELEBRITY POTATO." [ LAUGHTER ] I KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHY. I MEAN, JUST TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF TRUMP'S LATEST SPEECHES.
WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OF COURSE, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY'S STILL TALKING ABOUT THE NEW POKEMON GO GAME. IN FACT SOME HIGHWAY -- [ CHEERS ] YEAH, I LOVE IT TOO. SOME HIGHWAY SAFETY OFFICIALS ARE WARNING TEENAGERS TO NOT PLAY POKEMON GO WHILE DRIVING. AND WHEN THE TEENAGERS PULL OVER, THE OFFICIALS JUST DRIVE AHEAD OF THEM AND CATCH ALL THE POKEMON. [ LAUGHTER ] SUCKERS! WOO! WOO! SUCKERS! [ APPLAUSE ] TODAY WAS THE BIG AMAZON PRIME DAY SALE. OW! AMAZON PRIME DAY SALE. I SAW THAT WALMART COMPETED BY OFFERING ITS OWN EXCLUSIVE DEALS AND FREE SHIPPING. MEANWHILE THE GUYS OVER AT RADIOSHACK WERE OFFERING CUSTOMERS A SIP OUT OF THEIR FLASK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] YOU WANNA BUY -- YOU WANT FREE SHIPPING ON A 400 FOOT ETHER NET CABLE? [ LAUGHTER ] WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GO AND BUY A SQUARE BATTERY? YOU EVER PUT IT ON YOUR TONGUE AND BURN -- I'LL DO THE FIRST ONE FOR FREE. CHECK THIS OUT, NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT DINOSAURS MAY HAVE MADE MORE OF A MUMBLING NOISE WITH THEIR MOUTHS CLOSED INSTEAD OF BIG ROARS YOU SEE IN MOVIES. SO IF YOU WANT TO SEE A A GRUMBLING DINOSAUR, JUST GO BACK AND WATCH BERNIE SANDERS ENDORSE HILLARY CLINTON. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HILLARY IS MY TOP CHOICE -- [ MUMBLING ] FINALLY LAST NIGHT WAS ANOTHER EPISODE OF "THE BACHELORETTE." WE LOVE THAT SHOW. [ CHEERS ] LAST NIGHT, JO-JO AND THE GUYS LAST NIGHT THEY WENT TO ARGENTINA WHERE THEY VISITED A A HORSE RANCH. AND I -- I DON'T KNOW. I THINK ONE OF THE GUYS WHO WORKED AT THE RANCH SEEMED A A LITTLE TOO INTO HIS HORSE. CHECK THIS OUT.
I'M WATCHING HIM STROKE THIS ANIMAL AND I'M WATCHING HIM CONNECT WITH HIM.
HE WAS JUST SPEAKING TO HIS HORSE WITH HIS SPIRIT. THE HORSE IS LOVING IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY IS GETTING A TRIP TO THE FANTASY STABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE HORSE IS LIKE, "HEY, AT LEAST FEED ME A ROSE FIRST." WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE HAVE GOT A BIG WEEK OF SHOWS AHEAD. TOMORROW NIGHT, OUR PAL, KRISTEN WIIG WILL BE HERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

Jimmy: THE MOVIE'S FUNNY. WE'RE GOING GET TO TALKING ABOUT THE MOVIE GHOSTBUSTERS BECAUSE IT WAS SUPER FUNNY. SOMEONE I KNOW MAKES A CAMEO, MR. HIGGINS? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MELISSA AND I ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE, THEN GO HEAD TO HEAD IN A GAME OF "WORD SNEAK." VERY INTERESTING, IT'LL BE FUN FOR THAT. AND THEN FROM THE AWARD WINNING NEW SERIES "MR. ROBOT," THIS GUY HAS WON EVERY AWARD FOR THIS SHOW. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, WATCH IT. GET IT RIGHT NOW ON USA. IT'S FANTASTIC. IT CANNOT BE OVERHYPED.

JENNIFER LOPEZ AND THE CREATOR OF "HAMILTON," LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE GOING TO SING A NEW SONG, "LOVE MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND." IT'S A GREAT SONG. IT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW ON iTUNES, AND THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SONG WILL GO TO THE SOMOS ORLANDO FUND TO BENEFIT THOSE AFFECTED BY THE TRAGEDY IN ORLANDO LAST MONTH. IT'S A GREAT SONG, DOWNLOAD IT. CHECK IT OUT. [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S REALLY GOOD. ARE YOU PLAYING THE POKEMON GO?

Questlove: I JUST DOWNLOADED IT.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S FUN. IT'S REALLY INTERESTING. YOU WALK AROUND. YOU DON'T SEE -- IT'S JUST KIND OF A GOOGLE MAP OF WHERE YOU'RE WALKING. BUT THEN ONCE YOU GET TO DIFFERENT POKE STOPS, LIKE A A PURPLE STOP SIGN YOU CAN GO -- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT? SO YOU GO TO THIS THING AND PRESS A POKE STOP, IT'S LIKE USUALLY A PIECE OF ART OR SOME PLACE WHERE YOU ARE WHERE IT'S LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW, IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THAT'S WHEN YOU GET LIKE THE POKE BALLS OR WHATEVER THEN COME OUT -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THOSE RED BALLS THAT YOU GET AND YOU THROW TO CATCH THE MONSTERS.

Steve: OKAY, WELL --
Jimmy: SO I GO TO -- I GO HOME LAST NIGHT AFTER THE SHOW AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE GAME I'M PLAYING POKEMON GO. AND YOU CAN SEE A COUPLE OF POKE STOPS, YOU KNOW, IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I CLICK ON A POKE THING AND THERE'S A THING THAT YOU CAN PUT IN THE TOP CALLED A LURE. TRUE STORY. YOU PUT A LURE IN, AND APPARENTLY THAT LURE'S MONSTERS AROUND YOUR POKE STOP THAT YOU CAN GET MONSTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT LURES HUMANS. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE HUMAN BEINGS. IF YOU'RE PLAYING, IF YOU'RE AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU SEE THERE'S A LURE OUT THERE, AND YOU CAN GO TO THAT SPOT TO GET MONSTERS. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME YET SO I'M LIKE DOING THIS. I'M LIKE OH WHATEVER, I PLAY FOR A LITTLE BIT OR WHATEVER I'M DONE AND I GO TO BED AND NEXT DAY I WAS TALKING TO MY NEIGHBOR IN THE ELEVATOR TODAY.
