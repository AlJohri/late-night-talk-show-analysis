[ LAUGHTER ] OR BREATHE OUT. YOU KNOW? DO YOU HAVE THE SHIRT YOU CAN'T SIT DOWN IN? YOU LOOK GREAT, BY THE WAY. DOES HE LOOK GREAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU LOOK GREAT. DID YOU HAVE CLOTHES -- DO YOU HAVE CLOTHES THAT YOU FAT OUT OF?
Jimmy: I DO. I HAVE A BELT. THERE'S A HOLE THAT STRETCHED, AND YOU GO, ONE TIME I USED TO USE THAT HOLE TO USE MY BELT, AND NOW THAT'S JUST -- IT'S A MEMORY.
JUST A REMINDER THAT YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF.
Jimmy: IT'S A MEMORY, YEAH.
BECAUSE I HAVE ALL THE CLOTHES THAT DON'T FIT ME ANY MORE IN MY CLOSET IN CASE I HAVE A DRAMATIC WEIGHT LOSS OVER A WEEKEND.
Jimmy: YOU KEEP THEM.
YEAH, IT'S LIKE I'M CURATING AN EXHIBIT OF MY WEIGHT GAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, OH. THAT SUIT WAS FROM 30 POUNDS AGO AND -- THAT SWEATER WAS FROM LAST MONTH AND -- THAT SHIRT, WELL, THAT SHIRT NEVER FIT.
Jimmy: NEVER DID, BUT ALMOST MADE IT.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU BOUGHT THE SHIRT -- BOUGHT CLOTHING THINKING THAT'LL BE THE INCENTIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, WELL I'VE ONLY GAINED WEIGHT FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS, MAYBE THIS SHIRT WILL TURN IT AROUND. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW'D YOU LOSE WEIGHT? OH, I BOUGHT A SHIRT. [ LAUGHTER ] WORKS AMAZING.
Jimmy: IT REALLY DOES WORK. BUT NOW, YOU'RE TOURING. YOU'RE TOURING CONSTANTLY. YOU'RE GOING INTERNATIONAL.
I DID SOME INTERNATIONAL SHOWS. THAT IS FUN, RIGHT?
Jimmy: IT'S GOOD, YEAH.
IT'S GREAT. I LOVE TRAVELING INTERNATIONALLY. IT'S A LITTLE -- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO THROUGH CUSTOMS AND IMMIGRATION, THAT CAN BE STRESSFUL. RIGHT. BECAUSE THEY'RE DRESSED LIKE THEY'RE IN A S.W.A.T. TEAM, RIGHT?
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THERE'S ALWAYS KIND OF, I GET NERVOUS. I'M ALWAYS LIKE, DO I HAVE HEROIN ON ME? [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HEROIN LOOKS LIKE. BUT I MIGHT HAVE ACCIDENTALLY PACKED SOME.
Jimmy: ME TOO.
I DON'T KNOW! AND THERE'S, I GET NERVOUS DURING THAT MINI INTERVIEW. THEY'RE LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO IN OUR COUNTRY? AND I'M LIKE, "MURDER PEOPLE." [ LAUGHTER ] I WASN'T READY FOR YOUR TRICK QUESTION. YOU KNOW? BUT I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.
Jimmy: MURDER PEOPLE. NO, NO, NO. THIS IS GOOD. WHY? WHY WOULD FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT?
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD TRAVELING INTERNATIONALLY. OH, BY THE WAY, I DON'T SPEAK ANY OTHER LANGUAGES. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT SAY I SPEAK FRENCH, GERMAN AND SOME PORTUGUESE AND I'M LIKE, I DON'T CARE. [ LAUGHTER ] I SPEAK ENGLISH, THE LANGUAGE JESUS SPOKE. YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU, YES! IT IS, THE ONLY WEIRD THING ABOUT TRAVELING INTERNATIONALLY, IT'S LIKE SOME COUNTRIES, YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T LIKE US. YOU KNOW LIKE THE AMERICANS, WE'RE LIKE THE NEW GERMANS, YOU KNOW? SO ARE YOU DISAGREEING WITH THE FACTS? YOU KNOW -- NO, ARE YOU STILL WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT FROM ME BECAUSE I LOOK LIKE HITLER'S WET DREAM. I KNOW THAT. THIS IS NOT A GOOD LOOK. I KNOW THAT. THIS IS NOT THE LOOK YOU WANT FOR THE TOUR OF THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM. ALL RIGHT? I'VE BEEN TO THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM AT D.C. I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD GO. I JUST SUGGEST YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE ME.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
I WAS WALKING AROUND AND PEOPLE WERE LIKE, "HE DID IT! THAT'S THE GUY FROM THE PHOTO." [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S NOT IN ARGENTINA, HE'S RIGHT HERE.
Jimmy: I THINK IT'S THE BLONDE, IT'S THE PALE.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I ACTUALLY, I THINK I'M TOO PALE FOR HITLER, RIGHT? HITLER WOULD HAVE SAID, I SAID ARYAN, NOT SNOWMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, MEET ME -- BY THE WAY, THAT'S HOW HITLER SOUNDED.
Jimmy: HE SOUNDS LIKE SAMMY DAVIS JR. ♪ I'M HITLER BABY THE HITLER MAN CAN ♪ [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, I KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE.
Jimmy: THE HITLER MAN CAN. YEAH.
I'M A VERY, VERY WHITE GUY. I'M LIKE UTAH. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT SAYING I DON'T FORGET WHAT I LOOK LIKE, YOU KNOW? YOU EVER FORGET WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE AND THEN YOU LOOK IN A A MIRROR AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, NO! [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?" BECAUSE DURING THE DAY I'M BRAD PITT, I'M BRAD -- I'M JOHN GOODMAN. WELL YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: YOU LOOK GOOD.
IT'S NOT FAIR.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK HERE, "FOOD: A LOVE STORY." YOU'VE GOT FIVE KIDS. I MEAN, YOU'RE A BUSY GUY, YOU'RE TOURING, WHAT DO YOU DO TO RELAX? WHAT DO YOU JUST DO TO CALM DOWN?
I WATCH THE SHOW.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I DO WATCH THE SHOW. OF COURSE I DO.
Jimmy: I APPRECIATE THAT.
I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU JIMMY.
Jimmy: I APPRECIATE THAT.
NO, BUT I WATCH A LOT OF TELEVISION. AND THERE'S SO MANY TELEVISION SHOWS AND SO MANY EPISODES OF TELEVISION SHOWS AT OUR DISPOSAL. SOMETIMES, I OPEN MY NETFLIX AND I'M LIKE, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO IT. THERE'S SO MUCH HERE, RIGHT? I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A DENT. IT'S DIFFERENT, IT USED TO BE IF YOU MISSED AN EPISODE OF A A SHOW YOU BE LIKE, WELL, I GUESS I'LL NEVER SEE THAT. BUT NOW IT'S LIKE, YOU LIKE THAT SHOW? YOU WANT TO SEE EVERY EPISODE? YOU WANT TO SEE ALL 500 SEASONS OF "LAW AND ORDER"? IN THIS EPISODE, OLIVIA BENSON'S A BABY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW? YOU END UP BINGE WATCHING, YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T SET OUT, ALL RIGHT, I'LL WATCH AN EPISODE OR TWO -- I HAVEN'T SHOWERED IN A WEEK? [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE ACTUALLY TOLD MYSELF "ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE SEASON! [ LAUGHTER ] THEN I'M GOING TO BED."
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.

Jimmy: YOU WANT THE ACCOMPLISHMENT.
