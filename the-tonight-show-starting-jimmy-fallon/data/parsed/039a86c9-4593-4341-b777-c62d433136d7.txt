Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT WE WANT! THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT! THAT'S A HOT CROWD! THAT IS A HOT CROWD RIGHT THERE! WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE THE SHOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT CONTINUES TO BE A ROUGH COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR TRUMP. NOW A FORMER "APPRENTICE" CONTESTANT SAYS THAT DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T KNOW THE NAMES OF ALL THE WOMEN ON THE SHOW AND WOULD DESCRIBE THEM BY THEIR BODIES AND LOOKS. [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT TRUMP SAID, "WHICH WOMEN SAID THAT? BROWN HAIR LAZY EYE? OR BLONDE HAIR NOSE JOB? I KNOW HER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID THIS WEEK THAT HE WAS VERY DISTURBED, DISAPPOINTED, AND EMBARRASSED BY DONALD TRUMP'S LEAKED COMMENTS. IN FACT IT WAS THE THI -- I'M SORRY. I SCREWED THAT UP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID THIS WEEK THAT HE WAS VERY DISTURBED, DISAPPOINTED, AND EMBARRASSED BY DONALD TRUMP'S LEAKED COMMENTS. IN FACT, IT WAS THE FIRST THING EVER THAT LEFT A BAD TASTE IN CHRISTIE'S MOUTH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] EVER.
Steve: EVER?
Jimmy: CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: "BLONDE LADY NOSE JOB? WAS IT LAZY -- IT WAS LAZY EYE, WASN'T IT?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT MIKE HUCKABEE TALKED TO MEGYN KELLY YESTERDAY ABOUT WHY VOTERS SHOULD SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. AND HE COMPARED TRUMP TO CAPTAIN QUINT FROM THE MOVIE "JAWS." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE BEST METAPHOR.
HE'S LIKE CAPTAIN QUINT IN THE ORIGINAL MOVIE "JAWS." HE'S THE GUY WHO'S GOING TO SAVE YOUR BUTT AND SAVE YOUR FAMILY. AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHEN HE KILLS THE SHARK, YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUT IT. NOW, HILLARY IS THE SHARK. SHE'S GOING TO EAT YOUR BOAT. THAT'S THE CHOICE YOU GET TO MAKE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
NOW GOVERNOR, I HATE TO BE THE ONE TO TELL YOU THIS --
YOU'RE GONNA --
BUT CAPTAIN QUINT GOT EATEN BY THE SHARK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OH, NO! MY GOODNESS. NO SPOILERS! NO SPOILERS! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, HILLARY IS TELLING THE GUY PLANNING HER VICTORY PARTY "WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOME BIGGER BALLOONS." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] JUST TOO MUCH. I SAW THAT DONALD TRUMP JUST RELEASED A NEW TV AD ATTACKING HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH WITH CLIPS OF HER COUGHING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE END WHEN HE SAID, "I'M DONALD TRUMP AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE." [ SNIFFING ] [ LAUGHTER ] IS HE SNIFFING AGAIN? WHY'S HE SNIFFING ALL THE TIME? DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? TRUMP WAS TELLING VOTERS TO GET OUT AND VOTE AT A RALLY IN FLORIDA YESTERDAY. BUT CHECK OUT WHEN HE TOLD VOTERS TO GO TO THE POLL. NOW, KEEP IN MIND, THE ELECTION IS NOVEMBER 8th.
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S INCREDIBLE. IT'S A MOVEMENT. BUT IF WE DON'T WIN, ALL IT IS IS A LITTLE ASTERISK IN HISTORY. THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. SO GO AND REGISTER. MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT AND VOTE NOVEMBER 28th. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "BE SURE YOU GET OUT THERE. MY SUPPORTERS THOUGHT THE ELECTION WAS NOVEMBER 28th. SO THE ELECTION IS RIGGED. [ LAUGHTER ] IT SHOULD BE NOVEMBER 28th. IT SHOULD BE. I THINK THAT'S THE DATE IT SHOULD BE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT YESTERDAY AL GORE CAMPAIGNED FOR HILLARY CLINTON AT A FLORIDA RALLY, ATTENDED BY 1,600 PEOPLE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR GORE, A A RECOUNT SHOWED THAT IT WAS ONLY 1,300 PEOPLE. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HEY-O!
Jimmy: "HOW'S IT HANGING, CHAD?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS INTERESTING. A NEW STUDY FINDS THAT HAVING ACNE COULD BE A GOOD THING, BECAUSE IT PROTECTS YOUR SKIN FROM AGING. [ CHEERS ] AND TEENAGERS ARE LIKE, "RIGHT NOW IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT'S PROTECTING ME FROM GIRLS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LISTEN TO THIS. SAMSUNG IS SENDING OUT THERMALLY INSULATED FLAME-PROOF BOXES FOR PEOPLE RETURNING ITS EXPLODING GALAXY NOTE 7 PHONES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SAMSUNG SAYS THEY'RE BEING EXTRA CAUTIOUS. WHILE U.P.S. IS SAYING, PLEASE USE FEDEX. PLEASE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST DON'T GET US INVOLVED. AND FINALLY, AFTER SAMSUNG ANNOUNCED THAT IT'S PERMANENTLY STOPPING PRODUCTION ON ITS EXPLODING GALAXY NOTE 7, I READ THAT APPLE COULD SELL AN ADDITIONAL 15 MILLION iPHONES.

WE WERE PRETENDING WE WERE FRIENDS -- BEST FRIENDS THAT HAD GOTTEN ENGAGED AT THE SAME TIME AND THIS WAS OUR PRE-BACHELORETTE. THIS WASN'T THE REAL BACHELORETTE. YOU NOW WHAT I MEAN? THIS WAS THE PRE-BACHELORETTE.
Jimmy: I HAVE A PICTURE OF YOU -- THIS IS YOU IN THE ELEVATOR. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THE ELEVATOR WITH YOUR BUDDY AND STANDING IN THE BACKGROUND --
AND THAT'S MY FRIEND CONNOR IN THE BACK.
Jimmy: NOT TOO SHABBY. I LIKE THIS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I COULD DO THIS. THIS IS FUN THEME WEEKEND. [ APPLAUSE ]
I LOVE IT SO MUCH. IT MAKES US SO HAPPY. AND I LEFT MY ENGAGEMENT RING THAT WEEKEND. SO IF ANYBODY FINDS IT IN A.C., LET ME KNOW.
Jimmy: BUT IT'S NOT REAL AT ALL.
AND I ALSO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE, I HAVE TO GO BACK, BECAUSE I DIDN'T CASH OUT.
Jimmy: WOW!
$15.46.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS! THAT IS BIG-TIME! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CHA-CHING!
I GOTTA GO BACK FOR MY RING AND MY $15.
Jimmy: YOU SCORED RIGHT THERE, 15 BUCKS. USUALLY I'M NEGATIVE WHEN I LEAVE.
I'M ACTUALLY SAVING THIS FOR MY NEXT -- I AM GOING TO CASH -- I HAVE A YEAR.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU GAMBLE? WHAT DO YOU PLAY?
SLOTS.
Jimmy: SLOTS, YEAH, OF COURSE. COINS DON'T COME OUT ANYMORE, RIGHT? THAT'S A THING OF THE PAST.
NO. THEY JUST HAVE THE SAD SOUND. NO REAL COINS.
Jimmy: "YOU HAVE WON. CONGRATULATIONS."
NOT EVEN THAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NEXT TIME WE WANT TO GO FOR TWO NIGHTS.
Jimmy: YOU ONLY WENT FOR ONE NIGHT? AND YOU MAKE 15 BUCKS. DUDE, LET'S GO FOR 30 BUCKS NEXT TIME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BIG TIME, MAN. HERE YOU ARE ON THE COVER OF "TOWN & COUNTRY." CONGRATS ON THAT. AND IN THE MAGAZINE YOU TALK ABOUT DATING LIFE.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT A FAN OF DATING.
I REGRET SAYING THAT JUST A A LITTLE BIT. BECAUSE NOW NOBODY'S GOING TO WANT TO TAKE ME ON A DATE BECAUSE I SAID I HATE DATING.
Jimmy: NO, NO, PLEASE, PLEASE. IT'S --
DATES ARE WEIRD. ESPECIALLY DINNER DATES. LIKE, I THINK THAT EATING IN FRONT OF SOMEBODY IS KIND OF PERSONAL. YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW THIS PERSON. SO THEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT TO ORDER THAT'S EASY TO EAT, AND TALK, AND NOT MESSY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET IN YOUR TEETH. NOT A GROSS FOOD.
Jimmy: I'LL JUST HAVE THE BROTH.
MY FRIEND DOM -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: JUST A BOWL OF BROTH, THANK YOU. A SMALL BOWL.
NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT EITHER. 'CAUSE THAT'S WEIRD. NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT EITHER. MY FRIEND DOM, SHE TOLD ME THAT PENNE IS THE PASTA OF DATES. PENNE PASTA.
Jimmy: I CALL IT PENNE.
OH, SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DON'T TAKE ME ON A A DATE. THAT'S AWFUL. HOW FRENCH. FRENCH ITALIAN PASTA! PENNE! THE GARLIC BAGUETTES.
NO, MAYBE I'M WRONG. I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT AGAIN.
Jimmy: I HAVE NO IDEA. I JUST EAT WITH MY MOUTH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M MARRIED. I'M MARRIED. I HAVE NO RULES.
IT'S INDIVIDUAL PIECES. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. YOU CAN FORK ONE, PUT IT IN THERE, IT'S LIKE VERY CLEAN.
Jimmy: OH I SEE. IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS --
OH, JESUS.
Jimmy: -- THIS WOULD BE A A NIGHTMARE.
NO, THAT'S A NIGHTMARE!
Jimmy: THAT'S A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE.
AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE!
Jimmy: THIS IS FROM OUR BUDDY FRANK PELLEGRINO AND THOSE GUYS OVER AT RAO'S HERE IN MANHATTAN. I THINK WE'RE BUDDIES. WE'RE CLOSE ENOUGH FRIENDS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FRANK PELLEGRINO JR. I LOVE THAT GUY. HE'S AWESOME. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
OH, MY GOSH.
Jimmy: "WOULD I KNOW YOU FROM ANY MOVIES? TELL ME ABOUT IT. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE IN A A MOVIE?" [ LAUGHTER ]
THIS DOESN'T WORK!
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T EVEN EAT YET. FORGET IT! I'M NOT DATING YOU, YOU LOSER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OH, MY GOD. YEAH. EAT THE PENNE. WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE PENNE! BUT THEY'RE OUT! [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE OUT OF PENNE AGAIN! SACRE BLEU! I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR IT ALWAYS. JUST GO FOR IT. EAT SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS. YOU'RE THE COOLEST GIRL, COME ON.
NOODLES HANGING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: THEY DON'T LIKE THEY WAY -- SCREW THEM, YOU DON'T NEED THOSE GUYS. TELL ME ABOUT THIS MOVIE, "AMERICAN PASTORAL." THIS IS -- EWAN McGREGOR, WHO I LOVE.
YEAH, SO --
Jimmy: DIRECTING.
IT'S HIS FIRST TIME DIRECTING A FILM.
Jimmy: LOVE THAT GUY. COOL GUY.
HE'S ALSO IN IT. I PLAY HIS DAUGHTER AND JENNIFER CONNELLY'S DAUGHTER.
Jimmy: SHE'S FANTASTIC TOO.
I KNOW. THEY'RE BOTH SO AMAZING.
Jimmy: THAT'S A DARK MOVIE. I THINK YOU -- VERY GREAT JOB ACTING. YOU HAVE A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT IN THE FILM.
I DO, YEAH.
Jimmy: WHICH IS -- THAT MUST BE COMPLETELY TOUGH, TOO, A A DIFFERENT WAY TO ACT THERE.
I MEAN, IT WAS AN OBVIOUS CHALLENGE, IT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT I DON'T DEAL WITH IN MY OWN LIFE, AND SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO GET RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YEAH.
Jimmy: I THINK YOU DID A A GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YEAH.
Jimmy: DO YOU WANT TO TELL EVERYONE WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT?
YEAH, THE FILM IS ABOUT AN AMERICAN FAMILY AND IT STARTS IN THE '40s, AND I COME IN IN THE '60s. I'M A TEENAGER GROWING UP, SORT OF, IN THE TUMULTUOUS TIMES OF THE 1960s IN AMERICA. AND IT'S KIND OF ABOUT PERCEPTION VERSUS REALITY. HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE THIS FAMILY TO BE PERFECT, AND TO HAVE IT ALL. AND IT KIND OF QUESTIONS WHETHER YOU CAN EVER REALLY KNOW SOMEONE. AND THAT APPEARANCES AREN'T ALWAYS TRUE.
Jimmy: YOU NEVER KNOW EVERYONE'S STORY, YEAH, YEAH. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S "AMERICAN PASTORAL." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. ♪♪
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT I ASKED YOU?

THIS IS PART OF AMERICA, TOO, YOU KNOW.
