I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A STYLIST YET. I COULDN'T BELIEVE I WENT. I WAS LIKE 90 ROWS BACK.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD DRESS. [ CHEERS ] THAT'S A GOOD DRESS. YOU GOT A GOOD DRESS AT THE MALL. YOU WERE 90 ROWS BACK?
90 ROWS BACK. I HAD NO IDEA THAT I WAS -- 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE WERE OTHER ARTISTS THAT WERE OUT PRIOR TO ME FOR LONGER. AND I WAS LIKE, "THERE'S NO WAY." I'M SEATED IN THE WAY BACK IN THE BLEACHERS. I'M OUT --
Jimmy: IF I WAS GOING TO WIN, THEY WOULD SIT ME CLOSER.
I'M OUT. I'M OUT. BUT THEN THEY CALLED MY NAME. I REMEMBER, MELISSA ETHERIDGE WAS PART OF THAT CLAN UP THERE. AND I WAS LIKE ALL OF A A SUDDEN -- I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I HAD TEARS IN MY EYES. I HAD TO WALK ALL THE WAY, 90 SEATS UP TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE AND IT WAS GREAT. I, LIKE, MOUTHED TO THE CAMERA. I REMEMBER, LIKE, "I LOVE YOU, MOM." I WAS SUCH A BABY.
Jimmy: I MEAN -- AND IT WAS BEST NEW ARTIST?
BEST NEW ARTIST. WHICH IS REALLY SPECIAL, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WIN THAT GRAMMY EVER AGAIN. YOU CAN'T BE A BEST NEW ARTIST --
Jimmy: TWICE.
TWICE.
Jimmy: NO, YOU CAN'T YOU'RE ACTUALLY AN ARTIST NOW. YOU'RE ALREADY ESTABLISHED. BUT LOOK AT YOU -- SO, WHERE DID YOU MOVE FROM? WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?
AT THAT POINT, WEXFORD, A A TOWN IN PENNSYLVANIA. SO, PITTSBURGH, REALLY. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: A BIG CHANGE?
A HUGE CHANGE, YEAH. A HUGE CHANGE.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS IT LIKE COMING TO L.A.? DID YOU MEET ANY CELEBRITIES? DID YOU GO, LIKE, "OH MY, GOSH"? DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST ONE YOU RAN INTO?
YES, I DO. IT WAS -- I WENT TO THE IVY. THE IVY IS, LIKE, A BIG PLACE TO GO IN L.A.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
LIKE A PLACE TO GO TO FEEL COOL, AND LIKE, "OH, I'M PART OF THE L.A. SCENE." SO, I WENT TO THE IVY. IN THE BACK, YOU KNOW, ALL THESE BUSINESS GUYS OR WHATEVER. I WAS ALWAYS LIKE THE LITTLE GIRL -- YOU KNOW, AT THE OLDER MAN TABLE, IT WAS AWKWARD, AND DREW BARRYMORE WAS SITTING, LIKE, AT THE NEXT TABLE IN FRONT OF ME. AND I THINK SHE WAS JUST DOING HER MOVIE "HOME FRIES" OR SOMETHING AT THE TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SHE WAS JUST LIKE, WITH THIS GUY AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD." SO STARSTRUCK. I WAS LIKE, "SHE'S OVER THERE. SHE'S OVER THERE." AND I'M A HUGE FAN OF DREW'S. THEY WERE LIKE, "YOU SHOULD GO JUST SAY HI TO HER." SO, I FINALLY WORKED UP THE COURAGE WHEN HER BOYFRIEND WENT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM, AND I WENT OVER THERE AND I WAS LIKE, "I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, BUT I'M A REALLY, REALLY HUGE FAN. I'M OUT HERE, I'M RECORDING MY ALBUM FOR THE FIRST TIME." I WAS SO -- YEAH, I WAS TOTALLY SHY AND EMBARRASSED. AND SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SWEETER, SHE WAS LIKE THE SWEETEST PERSON. SO CUT TO, LIKE, YEARS LATER WHEN I SEE HER. AND NOW, LIKE, I'M ON TOUR WITH JUSTIN AND I THINK HE WAS DATING CAMERON AND THE WHOLE THING. SHE WAS THERE, I WAS LIKE, "DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO L.A. AND I SAW YOU AT THE IVY AND I CAME UP TO YOU AND I SAID, HI, I WAS A BIG FAN?" SHE WAS LIKE, "NOT REALLY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO. HAPPENS TO ME EVERY SINGLE DAY.
BUT I KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE. NOW YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE, YOU KNOW, "OH, DO YOU REMEMBER ME FROM 1994?" I'M LIKE, "NO."
Jimmy: WELL, YOU'VE BEEN AROUND NOW. YOU'RE A MOM, YOU HAVE TWO LITTLE KIDS.
I DO. I DO.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HOW OLD ARE THE BABIES?
THANK YOU, GUYS. MY SON JUST TURNED EIGHT. AND HE IS A PARKOUR MASTER. AND MY DAUGHTER, WE JUST CELEBRATED THE SUPER BOWL, AND SHE IS ONE AND A HALF AND THE CUTEST LITTLE ANGEL.
Jimmy: ARE YOU KIDDING ME? LOOK AT THIS. OH, MY GOSH. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] THAT IS ADORABLE.
SHE'S LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME. I ALWAYS SAY IT, IF I DIDN'T CALL HER SUMMER, I WOULD HAVE CALLED HER JOY. 'CAUSE SHE'S JUST A LITTLE BALL OF HAPPINESS.
Jimmy: A HAPPY LITTLE BABY? AND WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S JUMPING OFF OF --
HE'S MY DAREDEVIL. I THREW HIM AN "AMERICAN NINJA WARRIOR" PARTY. AND I HAD A COUPLE, LIKE, AMERICAN NINJA WARRIORS SHOW UP AND EVERYTHING. I AM SO NOT COOL, BUT THAT GAVE ME COOL POINTS WITH MY SON.
Jimmy: HE DOESN'T THINK YOU'RE COOL?
HE DOESN'T CARE, LIKE, THE GRAMMIES ON THE SHELF -- EH. YOU KNOW, THE RED CHAIR AT "THE VOICE" -- EH. BUT IF I CAN DO A STUNT ON "AMERICAN NINJA WARRIOR", HE WOULD BE LIKE -- I WOULD EARN SO MANY POINTS. BUT I DID. I DID A LITTLE A STUNT WITH HIM AT THAT PARTY. SO THAT WAS FUN.
Jimmy: IT MADE YOU COOL?
WELL, YEAH --
Jimmy: BUT YOU'RE THE BEST. YOU ARE THE COOLEST MOM. COME ON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU ARE.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WHAT'S HAPPENING ON "THE VOICE" THIS SEASON NOW? YOU GETTING A TEAM?
I DO. I'M REALLY HOPING -- 'CAUSE WE CALL IT THE GIRL CURSE. LIKE, NO FEMALE COACH HAS EVER TAKEN HOME AN ACTUAL WINNER. IT'S, LIKE, WEIRD. IT IS A LITTLE IMBALANCED AROUND THOSE PARTS. SO, I CAN SEE THE ODDS ARE A A LITTLE AGAINST US. BUT THIS YEAR MY TEAM IS SOLID AND EVEN THE BOYS ARE LIKE, "MAN, YOU MIGHT BREAK THE GIRL CURSE THIS YEAR." YOU KNOW? YEAH.
Jimmy: GOOD BLAKE. "YOU MIGHT BREAK THE GIRL CURSE."
I START TALKING LIKE HIM WHEN I'M AROUND HIM. I'M LIKE, "YEAH. DURR DUH DURR-DURR DOO." [ LAUGHTER ] HE BUSTS MINE, SO I HAVE TO BUST HIS A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: OH, OF COURSE. BUT YOU HAVE, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? YOU HAVE A GOOD ADVISOR THIS YEAR. MILEY CYRUS IS HELPING YOU OUT.
YES.
Jimmy: SHE'S FANTASTIC.
SHE'S SO MUCH FUN, GUYS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SHE'S THE REAL DEAL AS WELL.
SHE IS.
Jimmy: SHE CAN SING. SHE CAN WRITE.
WE'RE BOTH SAGITTARIANS, WHICH I LOVE. AND WE'RE BOTH, LIKE, FIRE. WE'RE FIRE SIGNS. AND SHE'S JUST LIKE -- SHE LIKES TO LIVE IN THE MOMENT AND SHE'S FREE. SHE WON'T LET THE BOYS PUSH HER AROUND, WHICH I LIKE. I'M LIKE, YES. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO, YOU KNOW, SET THEM STRAIGHT SOMETIMES.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP OF YOU. HERE'S CHRISTINA AGUILERA ON SEASON TEN OF "THE VOICE." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
