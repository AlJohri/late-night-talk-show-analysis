SOME CRITICS ARE SAYING THAT THE U.S. AND THE CANADIAN WOMEN'S HOCKEY TEAMS ARE SO GOOD THAT IT'S UNFAIR TO THE OTHER TEAMS. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] WHAT? THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING MY MOM SAID AFTER ONE OF MY LITTLE LEAGUE GAMES. DON'T WORRY ABOUT STRIKING OUT, JIMMY. THAT GIRL WAS THROWING TOO HARD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SHE WAS. LET'S GO GET AN ICE CREAM. CHECK THIS OUT. RYAN SEACREST ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S LAUNCHING HIS OWN CLOTHING LINE THIS YEAR. [ SCATTERED CHEERS ] THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD CLOTHES.

Jimmy: THEY'RE SO NICE, YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THEM --
Steve: OF COURSE! OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT WERE YOU GUYS THINKING?
Steve: NOTHING.
Jimmy: WHEN ASKED WHY HE STARTED HIS OWN CLOTHING LINE, SEACREST SAID "BECAUSE IF I STOP WORKING, I DIE." HERE'S SOME TECH NEWS. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT APPLE IS PLANNING TO MAKE MEDICAL DEVICES THAT COULD HELP PREDICT HEART ATTACKS. WHICH IS IRONIC, SINCE MOST HEART ATTACKS HAPPEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU LOST YOUR iPHONE. [ LAUGHTER ] SOMEBODY CALL IT! SHH, BE QUIET. IT'S ON VIBRATE. SOMEBODY CALL IT!

THEY'RE SAYING THAT THE U.S. IS ACTUALLY FACING A SHORTAGE OF CLOWNS. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] THEN THEY OPENED THE DOOR TO ONE CAR AND SAID, "NEVER MIND, HERE THEY ARE." THERE'S 20,000 CLOWNS IN THERE. VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. THIS STORY IS JUST CRAZY. LAST WEEK A WOMAN IN MISSISSIPPI, WHO WAS EXPECTING TRIPLETS, GAVE BIRTH TO QUADRUPLETS WITHOUT REALIZING SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE A FOURTH BABY. THAT EXPLAINS THE BABIES' NAMES. JODI, BRODY, CODY AND FOURTH. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GUYS, LAST NIGHT WAS THE SEVENTH EPISODE OF "THE BACHELOR." YOU GUYS LOVE "THE BACHELOR"?

Jimmy: WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.
CLAIRE, I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU. I DON'T LIKE YOU. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE FRIENDS. YOU CAN JUST EXCUSE YOURSELF FROM MY ROOM.
I CAN EXCUSE MYSELF? THIS IS ALL OF OUR SUITE.

THEY JUST STARTED WORKING ON IT. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST STARTED WORKING ON IT. IT'S A GOOD START. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. THIS IS KIND OF SCARY. SCIENTISTS SAY THAT AN ASTEROID THE SIZE OF THREE FOOTBALL FIELDS FLEW PAST EARTH LAST NIGHT. SCIENTISTS ARE HAPPY THE ASTEROIDS MISSED, WHILE THEIR DADS WERE PROUD THEY SAID THE WORDS "FOOTBALL FIELD." GO GET IT, SON. THAT WAS GREAT. REALLY PROUD OF YOU. FOOTBALL? THREE FOOTBALL FIELDS. I WANT TO SAY CONGRATS TO MY MAN CHARLIE SHEEN. HE JUST ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S GETTING MARRIED FOR THE FOURTH TIME.

BUT, I KNOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR PHONE. EVERYBODY HERE HAS GOT THEIR PHONE. THERE'S NOT ONE PERSON HERE WHO DOESN'T HAVE IT. YOU BETTER HAVE IT. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE IT. BECAUSE THERE IS NO SAFETY. THERE IS NO COMFORT. THERE IS NO SECURITY FOR YOU IN THIS LIFE ANYMORE UNLESS WHEN YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET YOU CAN FEEL A HARD RECTANGLE IN YOUR PANTS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU WANT SOME SOLID JUICE IN IT, TOO! YOU WANT A JUICED UP, HARD RECTANGLE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S YOUR LIFE. BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE, RIGHT?

NOT THE WAY YOU SCROLL THROUGH THEIR NAMES IN YOUR CONTACT LIST LIKE A GAY FRENCH KING. [ LAUGHTER ] WHO PLEASES ME TODAY? WHO SHALL I FAVOR? WHO SHALL I DELETE? [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE CALL IT A PHONE. BUT WE DON'T REALLY USE IT MUCH AS A PHONE, DO WE? NO, WE DON'T. BECAUSE THEY GAVE US THE OPTION. SOME YEARS AGO, YOU WERE GIVEN THE OPTION. WELL, YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE TO ANOTHER PERSON. YOU COULD TALK, YOU COULD TYPE. WELL, ONCE YOU HAD THAT OPTION. WELL, THAT TOOK HALF A SECOND. TALKING LOST. TALKING'S OVER. WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK. OH, MY GOD, I'VE GOT TO TALK? DO I HAVE TO TALK TO THIS PERSON NOW? TALKING IS WORK. YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THAT GO WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, DIFFERENT HAND GESTURES. YOU'VE GOT TO SUCK AIR IN.

THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO SAY. I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] E-MAIL, I LIKE. I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE USE OF THE WORD MAIL IN E-MAIL. USING THE SAME TERM THAT WE'RE USING FOR THE POSTAL SERVICE. I DON'T SEE A LOT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS. ONE OF THEM OCCURRING IN DIGITAL FIBER OPTIC HYPERSPACE. THE OTHER A DAZED AND CONFUSED DISTANT BRANCH OF THE CUB SCOUTS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUMBLING AROUND THE STREET IN EMBARRASSING SHORTS AND JACKETS WITH MEANINGLESS PATCHES AND VICTORY MEDALS. DRIVING FOUR MILES AN HOUR, 20 FEET AT A TIME ON THE WRONG SIDE OF A MENTALLY HANDICAPPED JEEP. [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVE HOW THE POSTAL SYSTEM HAS THIS FINANCIAL EMOTIONAL MELTDOWN EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS THAT THEIR BUSINESS MODEL FROM 1630 ISN'T WORKING ANYMORE. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW A A 21st CENTURY INFORMATION SYSTEM BASED ON LICKING, WALKING AND A RANDOM NUMBER OF PENNIES IS STRUGGLING TO COMPETE. WHAT IS THE REASON? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO, THEY ALWAYS SENT THE POSTMASTER GENERAL -- HE ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE A BIG SPEECH ABOUT WHAT A TOUGH TIME THAT THEY'RE HAVING. AND HE COMES OUT AND HE'S FREAKED OUT. HE'S GOT RINGS UNDER THE EYES, NO SHAVE, PULLING ALL-NIGHTERS. WE CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE! WE'VE GOT TO GO UP A PENNY ON THE STAMPS! THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT! [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOME BREATHING ROOM. THE COST AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE'RE ALL LIKE -- HEY, DUDE, DO WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT TO DO. WE DON'T GIVE A DAMN. WHAT IS A STAMP ANYWAY? WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT COSTS. 43, 48, MAKE IT A BUCK. YOU'RE GOING TO GET THERE. YOU HAVE SOME MONEY LEFT OVER, BUY YOURSELF SOME PANTS AND A A REAL CAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S LIKE, IF I COULD TALK TO THE POST OFFICE, IF I COULD SAY IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE HELPFUL TO US, JUST OPEN THE LETTERS. READ THEM AND E-MAIL US WHAT IT SAYS!

Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE'RE TOO INTO THIS THING. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT SO INTO IT. WHEN WE WERE KIDS, OUR PARENTS DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT US! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW OUR NAMES! BUT, WHEN I THINK OF THE BEDTIME ROUTINE FOR MY KIDS, IT'S LIKE THE ROYAL CAR NATION JUBILEE CENTENNIAL OF RINSING AND PLAQUE AND DENTAL APPLIANCES AND THE STUFFED ANIMAL SEMI CIRCLE OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'VE GOT TO READ EIGHT DIFFERENT MORON BOOKS.
Jimmy: MORON BOOKS.
