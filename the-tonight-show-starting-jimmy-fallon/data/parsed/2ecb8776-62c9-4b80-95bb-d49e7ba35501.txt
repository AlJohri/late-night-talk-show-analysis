HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BILL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEP. 68, OR AS HE CALLS IT -- [ AS BILL CLINTON ] "ONE AWAY FROM THE FUN ONE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANT.
Steve: I THINK HE MEANS 67.
Jimmy: 67. THAT'S CORRECT, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF THE CLINTONS, HILLARY CLINTON IS RETURNING TO IOWA NEXT MONTH FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER FAILED PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2008. HILLARY DENIES JUST BEING THERE FOR POLITICS. SHE WAS LIKE, "I LOVE IOWA FOR THEIR --" [ SCATTERED CHEERS ] "OKAY, I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S RIDICULOUS. I HAD TO SAY IT SOME TIME. OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY CONTINUES TO BE THE SITUATION IN FERGUSON. AND IT JUST CAME OUT THAT THE MISSOURI GOVERNOR, JAY NIXON, APPARENTLY SENT THE NATIONAL GUARD TO FERGUSON WITHOUT LETTING THE WHITE HOUSE KNOW FIRST. WHEN HE HEARD THAT HE WAS LEFT OUT OF SUCH AN IMPORTANT DECISION, OBAMA SAID, "HOLY CRAP, I'VE BEEN BIDENED." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ AS PRESIDENT OBAMA ] "IS HE ASLEEP? IS JOE ASLEEP YET? IS HE SLEEPING? ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS." "HEY, GUYS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?" [ LAUGHTER ] "UH, NOTHING, JOE. NOTHING, JOE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?"

Jimmy: I CAN'T EVEN. YESTERDAY, FORD SAYS TORONTO NEEDS TO CONTROL ITS RACCOON POPULATION. [ LAUGHTER ] HE SAID THAT THEY'RE SO AGGRESSIVE THAT HE'S HAD SEVERAL STANDOFFS WITH THEM OUTSIDE HIS HOME. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S HAD STANDOFFS WITH RACCOONS OUTSIDE OF HIS HOME.
Steve: RACCOONS OUTSIDE HIS HOME.
Jimmy: YEAH, I MEAN, IT SOUNDS PRETTY SCARY. CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS -- SEEING THIS COMING AT YOU, IF YOU'RE A A RACCOON?
Steve: WHOA! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IF I'M A RACCOON, I WOULD --
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: HE SAYS THAT TORONTO'S RACCOONS ARE TOO AGGRESSIVE. HE WAS LIKE, "BY THE TIME THEY'RE DONE RUMMAGING THROUGH THE TRASH, THERE'S HARDLY ANYTHING LEFT FOR ME. I MEAN, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? WE GOT TO GET ON THIS AND FIX THIS PROBLEM!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOME SPORTS NEWS. YESTERDAY, THE CLIPPERS' NEW OWNER, FORMER MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE, STEVE BALLMER -- HE NOW OWNS THE CLIPPERS. YEAH, WELL, HE PROMISED FANS THAT THE TEAM WILL WIN AN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE SAYS HE HAS A GREAT STRATEGY FOR REBUILDING THE TEAM -- CONTROL-ALT-DELETE. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID, AND THEN WE'LL SEE -- WHEN IT COMES BACK UP, WE'LL SEE WHAT WE DO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, STEVE BALLMER SPOKE TO FANS AT THE CLIPPERS' RALLY YESTERDAY. BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL, BUT I THINK THAT HE WAS PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT HIS NEW TEAM. I DON'T KNOW.
DO WE HAVE ANY CLIPPER FANS HERE? THESE GUYS BUST THEIR BUTT FOR YOU! ONE MORE TIME, LOUDER! THAT WAS HARDCORE! HARDCORE, BABY! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THEN CLIPPERS FANS WERE LIKE, "WELL, AT LEAST THE RACIST GUY WAS QUIET." [ LAUGHTER ] POPCORN! GET YOUR POPCORN HERE! THIS IS INTERESTING. IN A NEW INTERVIEW, THE DIRECTOR OF "THE EXPENDABLES 3" HINTED THAT ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE MIGHT BE GAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT IS PRETTY EVIDENT HIS CHARACTER IS GAY WHEN HE SAYS -- [ AS SCHWARZENEGGER ] "GET TO THE MINI COOPER CONVERTIBLE NOW! COME ON! GET TO THE MINI COOPER! GRAB YOUR SWEATER, TIE IT AROUND YOUR NECK, AND LET'S RUN TO THE MINI COOPER CONVERTIBLE NOW!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MINI COOPER CONVERTIBLE? OH, OF COURSE, "BACHELOR IN PARADISE" IS IN FULL SWING OVER ON ABC. [ CHEERS ] YEAH. I LOVE THOSE SHOWS. AND I NOTICED THAT LAST NIGHT'S EPISODE, ONE OF THE GUYS WAS VERY THOROUGH WHEN IT CAME TO EXPLAINING HIS INTENTIONS.

I READ THAT THE POPULARITY OF UBER -- YOU KNOW, THAT APP ON YOUR PHONE, UBER? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S AN APP ON YOUR PHONE WHERE YOU CAN CALL A CAR TO COME PICK YOU UP. WELL, IT'S CAUSING A SPIKE IN PEOPLE ACCIDENTALLY GETTING INTO STRANGERS' CARS, THINKING THAT THEY ARE THEIR RIDE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE DRIVER I USED THIS MORNING KEPT BLARING THAT ANNOYING SONG AND SELLING ICE CREAM TO PEOPLE. AND I GO, OH, WHAT IS HE -- WORST UBER I EVER TOOK. I'LL TAKE TWO SPONGEBOBS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS IS TRUE. PEOPLE ARE ACCIDENTALLY GETTING INTO STRANGERS' CARS, THINKING THOSE ARE THEIR RIDES. SO, NOT ONLY IS THERE A SPIKE IN THAT, BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN A SHARP INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TIMES PEOPLE HAVE SAID THE FOLLOWING SENTENCES. "OH, CRAP, SORRY." [ LAUGHTER ] "OH, I WAS WONDERING WHY WE WERE SITTING HERE FIVE MINUTES AND YOU DIDN'T START DRIVING ANYWHERE." [ LAUGHTER ] "THAT'S GREAT. FIRST, MY WIFE LEFT ME AND NOW THIS. THIS IS JUST GREAT!" [ LAUGHTER ] "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YOU'RE NOT UBER. YOU SAID THAT ALL READY, BUT SOMEBODY'S STILL GOT TO TAKE ME TO THE AIRPORT." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN PUT THE LOTION IN THE BASKET? CAN YOU UNLOCK THESE DOORS, PLEASE?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GOT TO WATCH OUT. BE CAREFUL.

[ LAUGHTER ] THAT SHOULD WORK. [ LAUGHTER ] SOME BUSINESS NEWS. THE OWNERS OF DOLLAR GENERAL TRYING TO OUTBID FAMILY DOLLAR IN AN EFFORT TO BUY THE CHAIN DOLLAR TREE.
