TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- EMMA STONE, ROBINSON CANO, MUSICAL GUEST, KEITH URBAN, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW. AND NOW, HERE'S YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: LOVELY, LOVELY.
Jimmy: STONE BONE.
Steve: STONE BONE.
Jimmy: STONE BONE ON THE SHOW. WE HAVE ROBINSON CANO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE LOVE HIM. KEITH URBAN IS ROCKING IT OUT ON THE SHOW TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE TYPE OF SHOW -- UNBELIEVABLE. BUT WELCOME EVERYBODY. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE IT IS DONALD STERLING. [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] HE'S NOT HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, I GUESS HE'S THE OWNER OF THE L.A. CLIPPERS BASKETBALL TEAM. AND HE WAS RECORDED TELLING HIS GIRLFRIEND NOT TO HANG OUT WITH BLACK PEOPLE, AFTER SHE POSTED A PICTURE WITH MAGIC JOHNSON ON INSTAGRAM. STERLING SAYS IT WAS A A MISUNDERSTANDING. HE'S NOT SURE WHEN THE RECORDING WAS MADE. AND HE DOESN'T WANT MAGIC JOHNSON AT HIS GAMES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EVEN MEL GIBSON WAS LIKE, "JUST STOP TALKING. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST STOP -- JUST STOP TALKING. [ APPLAUSE ] JUST GO -- HANG OUT -- LET'S -- HE DIDN'T MEAN THAT. JUST GO SOMEWHERE. HANG OUT." AND I GUESS SOME PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY DEFENDING STERLING SAYING HE HAS A VERY GOOD RECORD OF HIRING MINORITIES. FOR INSTANCE HE ALWAYS HAS AT LEAST ONE WHITE GUY ON THE TEAM. ALWAYS. [ LAUGHTER ] AT LEAST -- ALWAYS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] YEAH. IN THEIR DEFENSE STERLING AND THE CLIPPERS RELEASED A A STATEMENT SAYING THEY WEREN'T SURE IF THE TAPE WAS EVEN REAL. THAT IS STILL NOT A GOOD SIGN IF YOU HEAR YOUR VOICE IN A A RACIST RANT AND GO "OH THAT MIGHT BE ME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING I MIGHT HAVE SAID, MAYBE." AND GET THIS. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. DONALD STERLING WAS ACTUALLY SCHEDULED TO RECEIVE A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE NAACP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: OY.
Jimmy: BUT THE ORGANIZATION HAS NOW CALLED OFF THAT CEREMONY. IT TURNS OUT BLACK PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED WITH HIM EITHER. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO IT KIND OF WORKS OUT PERFECT. WORKS OUT FOR EVERYBODY. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS WEIGHING IN. EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA IS CALLING DONALD STERLING'S RACIST REMARKS INCREDIBLY OFFENSIVE. AND YOU KNOW IT'S SAD WHEN EVEN PUTIN IS LIKE, "I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT I AM WITH OBAMA ON THIS ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THAT GUY -- THAT DUDE IS THE WORST MAN." WELL HERE'S SOME HAPPY NEWS YOU GUYS. OVER THE WEEKEND SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE EVER PREDICTED. DRUM ROLL. ♪♪ GEORGE CLOONEY IS ENGAGED, EVERYBODY. WOW! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ CLOONEY PROPOSED TO HIS GIRLFRIEND, BRITISH LAWYER, AMAL ALAMUDDIN. THAT'S RIGHT. GEORGE CLOONEY IS ENGAGED. UP NEXT, LOCUSTS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE CLOONEY IS ENGAGED. YOU CAN TELL THAT HE'S EXCITED TO GET MARRIED BECAUSE HE'S BEEN THROWING HIMSELF A A BACHELOR PARTY FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL HERE IS SOME INTERNATIONAL NEWS WITH THE U.S. CONSIDERING NEW SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA THERE ARE REPORTS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS CANCELED ANY FURTHER COMMUNICATION WITH THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE, "BIG DEAL. WE DID THAT YEARS AGO." [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF RUSSIA, A NEW STUDY -- A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT SELFIES TAKEN BY PEOPLE IN RUSSIA CONTAINED THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SMILES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND RUSSIANS ARE LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE ARE SMILING." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE HAVING A LOT OF FUN. HERE LISTEN TO THIS. THIS IS TOTALLY TRUE. I HEARD RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS WANT TO BAN SWEARING IN MOVIES. BEFORE THEY CAN VOTE ON THE LAW, THEY HAVE TO COMPILE A A LIST OF ALL THE WORDS THEY WON'T ALLOW. IN FACT, WE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET A HOLD OF THE LIST OF PROPOSED SWEAR WORDS THAT PUTIN WANTS TO GET RID OF.
Steve: REALLY WE HAVE THEM?
Jimmy: THEY GAVE IT TO US. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: OKAY. WOW, THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.
Jimmy: AND YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HEAR IT FIRST. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LEGALLY I DON'T KNOW IF OUR SHOW AIRS IN RUSSIA, I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE ALLOWED TO SAY THESE WORDS NOW.
Steve: RIGHT, BUT WE HAVE THEM NOW.
Jimmy: WE HAVE THEM NOW. AND IN AMERICA IT'S A FREE COUNTRY AND WE'RE ALLOWED TO SAY WHATEVER WORDS WE WANT.
Steve: YEAH, AMERICA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE CAN SAY WORDS LIKE "BORSCHTHOLE." [ LAUGHTER ] SUN OF A BITCH. [ LAUGHTER ] DOUCHE AND GRAB. [ LAUGHTER ] KAZACH SUCKER. [ LAUGHTER ] STROEGEN OF. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BEYOCHKA. [ LAUGHTER ] PUSSY RIOT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND JAGINOFF. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE YOU GO. THAT'S JUST THE WORDS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE GOT IT FIRST. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SAY THEM. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN'T SAY THEM. I DON'T KNOW. AND THIS IS COOL HERE. THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED THAT JOE BIDEN WILL TRAVEL TO BRAZIL IN JUNE TO ATTEND THE WORLD CUP. BIDEN SAID, "I'VE ALREADY GOT THE WAX JOB NOW I JUST NEED MY PASSPORT STAMPED." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, I READ THAT GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL WILL TRAVEL TO THE U.S. NEXT MONTH TO TALK WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA ABOUT THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE. AND ALSO TRY TO GET CLOONEY TO CHANGE HIS MIND. YOU CAN'T DO THAT! WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: HAPPY MONDAY EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: COME ON, MONDAY!
Jimmy: HAPPY MONDAY. WE'RE HAPPY TO BE BACK. WE GOT A BIG WEEK OF SHOWS AHEAD. TOMORROW NIGHT DIANE KEATON WILL BE HERE. THAT'S VERY COOL.

Steve: LOVELY.
Jimmy: LOVELY. SO FUN. SO MUCH FUN. AND I'M NOT MESSING AROUND WITH HER THIS TIME. I TOLD HER THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BATTLE. A LIP SYNC BATTLE TONIGHT. ME VERSUS EMMA STONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS SAYING THERE. THAT'S HOW DISASTER -- IT'S GOING TO BE NUTS TONIGHT. YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT. WELL, WHAT HAPPENS IS -- WHAT WE DO IS I TELL GUESTS TO PICK TWO SONGS AND I PICK TWO SONGS AND NEITHER OF US KNOW WHAT SONGS WE'RE DOING. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S BRINGING BUT IT CAN'T BE AS GOOD AS WHAT I'M BRINGING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] 'CAUSE I REALLY BROUGHT IT. I AM GOING FOR BLOOD.
Steve: IN THIS LIP SYNC -- IN THIS LIP SYNC BATTLE, I WILL DESTROY EMMA STONE. [ EVIL LAUGH ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL THIS GUY IS A FIVE TIME ALL STAR. HE'S THE BEST SECOND BASEMAN ON THE PLANET. FROM THE SEATTLE MARINERS, ROBINSON CANO IS DROPPING BY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND A PERFORMANCE FROM KEITH URBAN. IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

NOW, OBVIOUSLY CANO'S GOING TO HEAR A SHARE OF BOOS WHEN HE STEPS UP TO THE PLATE TOMORROW. WELL THAT COULD BE JARRING FOR ANY PLAYER. SO THAT'S WHY -- TO GET HIM USED TO IT, WE SENT ROBINSON CANO OUT TO THE STREETS OF NEW YORK -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- TO GET BOOED BY ACTUAL YANKEE FANS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HERE'S THE CATCH, THE FANS THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST BOOING A A CARDBOARD CUT OUT OF ROBINSON CANO. THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE REAL ROBINSON CANO WAS STANDING RIGHT BEHIND IT. THEIR REACTIONS ARE PRETTY GREAT. CHECK IT OUT.

YOU'RE HOSTING "THE TONIGHT SHOW."
Jimmy: I KNOW.
THIS IS CRAZY.
Jimmy: IT'S THE NEW ME.
IT'S A WHOLE NEW YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S A WHOLE NEW ME.
YOU HAVE THIS AURA ABOUT YOU NOW. YOUR AURA IS PURPLE.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YOUR AURA IS PURPLE.
Fallon: THAT'S GOOD. YOUR HAIR IS RED.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I WAS JUST QUOTING "ALMOST FAMOUS," WHICH IS A MOVIE THAT JIMMY MAYBE DID. [ LAUGHTER ] WITH CAMERON CROWE A COUPLE YEARS AGO.
Jimmy: I HEARD ABOUT HIM, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. HOW'S CAMERON CROWE DOING?

Jimmy: BUT THANK YOU, STONE BONE FOR COMING TO THE SHOW.
THANK YOU FOR FALLONIUS MONK FOR HAVING ME. [ LAUGHTER ]

WHAT KIND OF INTERNET SITES?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, WHAT SITES? [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL LET ME SIFT THROUGH MY ROLODEX.
Jimmy: YEAH.
LATELY I'VE BEEN CHECKING OUT SOME YOUNG MOM BLOGS.
Jimmy: MMM-HMM.
HERE'S HOW IT HAPPENED. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS -- NOW, THIS IS A PRETTY AMAZING SECTION OF THE INTERNET IF YOU HAVE NOT CHECKED THIS OUT.
Jimmy OKAY.
THERE ARE PEOPLE BLOGGING ABOUT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING. BUT THERE ARE WOMEN THAT ARE MY AGE THAT ARE MOTHERS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
OR IN MY AGE RANGE THAT ARE MOTHERS. AND I CAN'T EVEN GET MY LIFE TOGETHER ENOUGH TO PUT FURNITURE IN AN APARTMENT. I JUST PINTEREST EVERYTHING, WHICH IS ANOTHER THING. PINTEREST. SO WHAT DO YOU DO ON PINTEREST NOW? WHAT IS PINTEREST? I DON'T USE PINTEREST.
YOU DON'T USE PINTEREST?
Jimmy: HUH-UH. I HAVE NO PINTEREST IN IT AT ALL.
DO YOU GUYS KNOW PINTEREST? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU SEE?
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, SO IT'S THE THING TO BE ON.
SO PINTEREST IS BASICALLY LIKE MOOD BOARD ONLINE. AND YOU CAN LOOK ON DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND YOU CAN BUILD YOUR DREAM LIFE BASICALLY. YOU'RE LIKE, "OH THESE CLOTHES, I WOULD WEAR ALL THESE CLOTHES IF I COULD." OR LIKE, "THIS IS WHAT MY HOUSE WOULD LOOK LIKE." AND THERE'S JUST PICTURES THAT YOU PIN AS IF YOU WERE PINNING THEM TO A CORKBOARD BUT YOU'RE PINNING THEM TO AN INTERNET WEBSITE AND YOUR LIFE IS SAD BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EMMA, I DIDN'T MEAN TO DEPRESS YOU. I'M SORRY. WAIT, BUT WAIT -- I DIDN'T MEAN TO DEPRESS YOU.
THIS IS THE WORST DAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT DOES YOUR APARTMENT LOOK LIKE?
MY APARTMENT RIGHT NOW THAT I JUST RENTED IS EMPTY.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE AN EMPTY APARTMENT?
I JUST HAVE AN EMPTY APARTMENT. IT JUST SITS THERE. AND BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TRAVELING --
Jimmy: YOU'RE SPENDING ALL THIS TIME ON PINTEREST.
AND I'M JUST LIKE, READING ABOUT THESE MOMS THAT ARE LIKE DOING REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE TAKING CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN AND HAVING BUSY DAYS. AND I HAVE AN EMPTY APARTMENT THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR SQUATTERS, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW. I CAN FIND SOMEBODY TO HANG OUT.
NO FURNITURE. YOU CAN DECORATE IT WITH YOUR OWN PINTEREST STYLE.
Jimmy: WANT TO HAVE A KEGGER AT EMMA STONE'S APARTMENT? LET'S DO IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE COULD ALL FIT IN THERE.
IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN PINTEREST STYLE AND YOU WANT TO DECORATE A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT, YOU JUST GET IN THERE. IT'S FREE.
Jimmy: YEAH, CAN THEY LINK TO YOU OR TELL YOU SUGGESTIONS OF THINGS, OR NO?
I HAVE A -- MY PINTEREST IS SECRET BECAUSE I WOULD BE HUMILIATED IF EVERYONE WERE TO SEE HOW MANY INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES I HAVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO YOU PUT UP INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES AND EVERYTHING? REALLY?
OH YEAH I GOT A LOT OF LIKE, "JUST PICK YOURSELF UP BY THE BOOT STRAPS." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I LIKE THAT. "PICK YOUSELF UP BY THE BOOT STRAPS." THAT'S ALWAYS FUN.
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD QUOTES.
Jimmy: AND THEN HOW ABOUT REALITY SHOWS? ANYTHING YOU GOT FOR ME? ANY NEW ONES?
I'VE BEEN -- I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN WATCHING THAT MUCH TV.
Jimmy: OKAY.
BUT WHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND I FOUND OUT ABOUT TWO NEW SHOWS THAT I HAVE DECIDED I'M GOING TO GET REALLY INTO. EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN MUCH OF THEM YET.
Jimmy: OKAY, ENGLISH ONES, YEP.
"THE ONLY WAY IS ESSEX." IT'S BASICALLY LIKE "THE JERSEY SHORE" SORT OF.
Jimmy: I'M IN ALL READY. WAIT A SECOND --
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE "THE JERSEY SHORE" BUT I'M TRYING TO COMPARE IT TO AMERICAN TV SHOWS.
Jimmy: OKAY, I LIKE THAT.
AND THEN THERE'S ONE CALLED "MADE IN CHELSEA," WHICH REMINDS ME OF "THE HILLS." AND THERE'S A GUY ON SHOW THAT I'VE SEEN A CLIP OF THAT SAYS, "DARLING, YOU MUST COME IN FOR A RESTORATIVE GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S A GREAT LINE.
I'M GONNA WATCH THIS SHOW. I'M DEFINITELY WATCHING THIS SHOW.
Jimmy: I'M INTO A SHOW CALLED "SOUTHERN CHARM." I LIKE THAT SHOW.
"SOUTHERN CHARM?"
Jimmy: YEAH, ON BRAVO.
WHAT IT'S ABOUT?
Jimmy: SOUTHERN PEOPLE THAT ARE RICH. [ LAUGHTER ]
JUST LIKE RICH SOUTHERN PEOPLE?
Jimmy: AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS "CHRISLEY KNOWS ALL?" "CHRISLEY KNOWS BEST." CHRISLEY KNOWS BEST OR KNOWS ALL? KNOWS BEST. "CHRISLEY KNOWS BEST." AGAIN, IT'S ABOUT A RICH DUDE, SOUTHERN.
YOU JUST LOVE RICH SOUTHERN PEOPLE.
Jimmy: THERE'S LIKE A THEME THAT'S HAPPENING. BUT HIS YOUNG SON IS -- I LIKE HIS KIDS.
YOU WOULD LOVE "TERMS OF ENDEARMENT."
Jimmy: HIS KIDS ARE COOL AND HIS ONE KID SAYS -- [ SOUTHERN ACCENT ] "I WANT TO GO TO THAT THAT FOOTBALL GAME. I DON'T CARE WHAT DAD SAYS. ' I'M GONNA GO TO THAT FOOTBALL GAME. SO DAD'S WRONG. I'M JUST GONNA GO TAKE THE CAR AND GO TO THE FOOTBALL GAME. I DON'T CARE, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU GOT TO RISK IT TO GET THE BISCUIT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE JAM. THAT'S THE LINE. SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO RISK IT TO GET THE BISCUIT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? [ LAUGHTER ] SO I SAW THE MOVIE, CONGRATULATIONS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S A GIANT MOVIE.
YEAH IT'S A REALLY BIG MOVIE JUST IN TERMS OF ALL OF IT. IT'S ALL BIG.
Jimmy: THE ACTION, THE CGI. NO, IT IS. IT'S A LOT OF STUFF. BUT IT'S LIKE -- DID YOU SHOOT THAT ALL IN NEW YORK CITY?
IT WAS ALL IN NEW YORK CITY, YEAH.
Jimmy: DID THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK CITY JUST FREAK OUT AND BE LIKE, "OH MY GOD?"
IN MY EXPERIENCE THEY WERE REALLY EXCITED. YOU KNOW, ANYTHING TO DO SPIDERMAN IT'S LIKE A PRETTY BIG DEAL. BUT THE DIRECTOR KEEPS TELLING THIS STORY ABOUT THEY WERE BLOWING UP CARS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. "ABOUT THEY WERE BLOWING UP CARS."
Jimmy: YEAH.
IS THAT GRAMMATICALLY OKAY?
Jimmy: YEAH. THEY'RE BLOWING UP CARS.
HE'S TELLING STORY ABOUT THEY WERE BLOWING UP CARS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY WERE BLOWING UP CARS IN THE STREET AND PEOPLE APPARENTLY WERE SO -- YOU KNOW, NEW YORKERS JUST WANT TO GET TO WORK AND WANT TO GET HOME. AND SO THEY HAVE NO PERIPHERAL VISION AND THEY WOULD JUST WALK RIGHT BY. CAR ON FIRE. IT'S LIKE, "I DON'T CARE." SO THEY HAD TO HIRE PEOPLE TO REACT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH MY GOD! TO THINGS EXPLODING. IT'S LIKE, "YEAH, WHATEVER. ANOTHER CAR EXPLODES."
TAXI!
Jimmy: NEXT WEEKI'M GOING TO TAKE FIFTH AVENUE, IT'S TAKING TOO LONG.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: THAT'S GREATEST. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOUR CHARACTER THIS TIME? CAN YOU SAY?
SHE'S GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL. PRETTY BIG DEAL.
