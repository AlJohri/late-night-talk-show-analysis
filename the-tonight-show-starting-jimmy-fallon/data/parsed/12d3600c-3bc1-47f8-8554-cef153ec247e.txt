Questlove: 483.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: PLEASE. OH! HAVE A SEAT. ENJOY YOURSELF. WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME! THAT'S RIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S GOING TO BE FUN TONIGHT. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS. HERE'S WHAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT. SOME BIG ELECTION NEWS. IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT HILLARY CLINTON NOW HAS ENOUGH DELEGATES TO SECURE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. THAT'S RIGHT. [ CHEERS ] HILLARY WAS SO EXCITED WHEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE ASKED HER STAFF TO SCHEDULE 15 SECONDS OF SMILING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO? THAT'S RIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON HAS APPARENTLY EARNED ENOUGH DELEGATES TO CLINCH THE NOMINATION. HILLARY TOLD HER ASSISTANT TO BREAK OUT THE CHAMPAGNE. AND HE SAID, "ACTUALLY YOU DRANK IT ALL WHEN TRUMP SECURED HIS NOMINATION. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ OF COURSE HILLARY HAD TO REACH THE THRESHOLD OF 2,383 DELEGATES TO BECOME THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE. HILLARY HASN'T BEEN THIS EXCITED ABOUT A THRESHOLD SINCE THE ONE SHE CARRIED BILL OVER ON THEIR WEDDING NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "PUT ME DOWN. PUT ME DOWN. I GET IT. I GET IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I GET THE POINT. I UNDERSTAND." THIS MORNING HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT AND SAID IT WOULD BE "FABULOUS" IF SHE PICKS A FEMALE RUNNING MATE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HILLARY SAID, "GOOD IDEA. DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO DIDN'T WAIT TO ENDORSE ME UNTIL THE DAY I CLINCHED THE NOMINATION! NANCY PELOSI! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO DIDN'T WANT TO ENDORSE ME UNTIL THE DAY I CLINCHED THE NOMINATION, NANCY PELOSI! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND, NANCY PELOSI!" [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ NOW YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND NANCY PELOSI NOW YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND NANCY PELOSI ♪
Steve: TEQUILA.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. HILLARY, CALM DOWN. UNBELIEVABLE.
Steve: CRAZINESS.
Jimmy: WELL, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TO REPORT THAT HILLARY HAS GOTTEN ENOUGH DELEGATES TO BE THE NOMINEE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE THE PRIMARIES TODAY, BUT THE MATH IS PRETTY SIMPLE. TAKE A LOOK.
YOU SEE, THE NUMBER WE HAVE HER OVERALL HERE IS 2,384. AND THE MAGIC NUMBER 2,383.
SHE NEEDED 28 DELEGATES. REMEMBER, THIS YESTERDAY, SHE NEEDED 28, STEVE.
IF HE CAN GET -- MAKE THIS 29, 28. IF HE CAN GET THIS DOWN TO WITHIN 100.
AND THAT'S WHY ZERO IS OUR MOST IMPORTANT NUMBER OF THE DAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, OKAY, THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. YEAH. THAT CLEARS EVERYTHING UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] I UNDERSTAND. I FEEL LIKE THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME WE VOTE FOR A A PRESIDENT AND HAVE TO SHOW OUR WORK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S LIKE, CARRY THE FOUR. BUT NOW IT'S LOOKING LIKE HILLARY CLINTON HAS THE NOMINATION LOCKED UP. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HOPING THAT THE ELECTION MIGHT CALM DOWN A A LITTLE, AND THINGS CAN GET A A LITTLE MORE CIVIL. YEAH. AND I THINK WE'RE OFF TO A A PRETTY GOOD START. TAKE A LOOK.
AFTER WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT ME TODAY AND HER PHONY SPEECH. THAT WAS A PHONY SPEECH. THAT WAS A DONALD TRUMP HIT JOB. I WILL SAY THIS, HILLARY CLINTON HAS TO GO TO JAIL. OKAY. SHE HAS TO GO TO JAIL.
Jimmy: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. HEY. "SHE HAS TO GO TO JAIL. SHE HAS TO GO TO JAIL. SHE CANNOT PASS GO OR COLLECT $200. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHE HAS TO GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL. MOVE THE LITTLE SHOE OUT OF THE WAY. THOUGH, SHE CAN SPEND MONEY AT THE BEAUTIFUL TRUMP HOTEL ON BALTIC AVENUE." [ APPLAUSE ] SOME MORE TROUBLE FOR DONALD TRUMP. TODAY, PAUL RYAN SAID WHAT TRUMP IS SAYING ABOUT A JUDGE OF MEXICAN HERITAGE IS THE "TEXTBOOK DEFINITION" OF A A RACIST COMMENT. EVEN WORSE, THAT TEXTBOOK IS MADE BY TRUMP UNIVERSITY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND YOU GO, THAT'S THE IRONY. NANCY PELOSI. [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT ELIZABETH WARREN RECENTLY COMPARED TRUMP UNIVERSITY TO A USED CAR DEALERSHIP TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE. YEAH. THAT'S NOT REALLY A FAIR COMPARISON. SINCE, UNLIKE A DEGREE FROM TRUMP UNIVERSITY, A USED CAR CAN ACTUALLY GET YOU SOMEWHERE. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ APPLAUSE ] SEE THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
Steve: HO, HEY!
Jimmy: SUE ME! WELL, THIS IS KIND OF SCARY HERE. NASA JUST CONFIRMED AN ASTEROID THAT ENTERED THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE LAST WEEK ACTUALLY CAUSED A SONIC BOOM OVER ARIZONA. DON'T WORRY, EVERYONE, IF AN ASTEROID COMES CLOSE TO THE EARTH, NASA WILL BE SURE TO FILL US IN A FEW DAYS LATER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO DON'T -- YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. LAST NIGHT WAS ANOTHER EPISODE OF "THE BACHELORETTE." YOU KNOW -- THAT'S MY JAM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE BEST. AND THINGS GOT PRETTY TENSE WHEN ONE OF THE GUYS IS ACCUSED OF DOING STEROIDS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT FAIR TO JUDGE. [ LAUGHTER ] HOST CHRIS HARRISON DECIDED TO CONFRONT HIM ABOUT IT. HIS NAME IS CHAD. AND I'M NOT SURE IF HE DID A A GREAT JOB OF DENYING THIS. WATCH.
HE MADE A COMMENT ABOUT YOU BEING ON STEROIDS OR TESTOSTERONE.
YEAH, NO, I DIDN'T EVEN CARE ABOUT THAT.
A LOT OF THE GUYS HAVE MENTIONED YOU'RE ON STEROIDS.
YEAH. THERE'S NO WAY I COULD HAVE BROUGHT THEM WITH ME ANYWAYS. THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "I KNEW I COULDN'T BRING ANY STEROIDS SO I TOOK SIX MONTHS WORT BEFORE I CAME TO THIS THING. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BACK OFF, MAN! BACK OFF, PELOSI!" [ LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, A LITTLE CELEBRITY NEWS. KYLIE JENNER RECENTLY POSTED A A SNAPCHAT VIDEO OF HERSELF GIVING TWO LITTLE BOYS $100 FOR JUST TWO CUPS OF LEMONADE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NOBODY HAS PAID THAT MUCH FOR LEMONADE SINCE JAY Z. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY, EVERYBODY. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, I MENTIONED THIS FUN THING THAT WE WANT TO DO WITH ALL THE DADS OUT THERE FOR FATHER'S DAY. ANY DADS OUT THERE IN THE AUDIENCE? [ CHEERS ] ALL RIGHT. SO WE HAD TARIQ FROM THE ROOTS WRITE AN ORIGINAL RAP SONG IN HONOR OF DADS. NOW WE WANT TO MAKE A DAD RAP VIDEO. OKAY? AND WE NEED YOUR HELP.

THERE IS A MOMENT IN THE MOVIE I HAVE TO RIDE BACK INTO DODGE, YOU KNOW, ON HORSEBACK, YOU KNOW, FIRING THE WINCHESTER AND EVERYTHING. SO I HAD TO TRAIN ALL SUMMER JUST TO RIDE THE HORSE, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: AND YOU REALLY DID IT. YEAH, OF COURSE YOU DID. COME ON. [ CHEERS ]

Jimmy: YOU DON'T GET TO WEAR THAT JACKET FOR NOTHING.
YOU'VE GOT TO EARN THIS JACKET.
Jimmy: YOU GOT TO EARN THAT JACKET.
YEAH.
Jimmy: LOOKS GOOD, MAN. SUBTLE. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU'RE WEARING IT, REALLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, IT'S BETTER IF -- I WASN'T ACTUALLY ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE", SO IT WILL CONFUSE PEOPLE. THEY'LL THINK I'M ROBERT DOWNEY, JR. OR SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EXPLAIN THIS -- EXPLAIN THE STORY FIRST.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS TO YOU, WHICH IS THAT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE LIKE A CELEBRITY WRITES A A BOOK AND SOMEBODY ILLUSTRATES IT, ALL RIGHT. THIS GUY, GREG RUTH, WHO DREW THIS BOOK -- IT'S A GRAPHIC NOVEL -- IS A MAJOR ARTIST. AND I'M SO PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IT'S THE STORY OF GERONIMO AND CHIEF COCHISE AND THE STORY OF THE APACHE WARS. IT TRIES TO INCORPORATE THEIR POINT OF VIEW AS WELL AS THE WHITE POINT OF VIEW. AND IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PART OF AMERICAN HISTORY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE EVEN IN THE SOUTHWEST DON'T KNOW, AND IT'S SOMETHING AS A KID GROWING UP IN TEXAS AND CAMPING WITH MY DAD WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
Jimmy: HOW WAS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU? DID YOUR DAD TELL YOU THE STORIES OR --?
HE TOLD ME THEM, BUT HE WOULD TAKE ME, WE'D GO CAMPING DOWN AT COCHISE'S STRONGHOLD, AND WE'D SEE THE RESERVATIONS. AND I'D GET REAL CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. AND YOU KNOW, I GREW UP WATCHING ALL THESE COWBOY MOVIES, IN WHICH YOU THINK THE COWBOYS ARE ALL THE GOOD GUYS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN YOU TURN 13, 14 AND YOUR WHOLE POINT OF VIEW STARTS TO SHIFT ABOUT, "WAIT A SECOND, WHAT WAS HAPPENING?"
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND IT JUST SURPRISED ME HOW MUCH WE DON'T GET TAUGHT THIS PART OF HISTORY. AND IT'S SO -- IT'S NOT LIKE, SOME BORING HISTORY WHERE, YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO -- IT'S REALLY THRILLING.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT TEXTBOOK, IT'S MORE ACTION THAN I'VE EVER SEEN IN ANY GRAPHIC NOVEL, YEAH.
AND I KEPT THINKING IF SHAKESPEARE WERE ALIVE, YOU KNOW, HE'D WANT TO TELL THE STORY OF GERONIMO. AND THIS IS AN -- IT'S NOT JUST -- HE'S AN INCREDIBLY MULTIFACETED FIGURE WHO IS NOT ONE THING, YOU KNOW? HE'S PART VICTIM, PART HERO, PART NOBLE, PART BETRAYER. IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED.
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU END UP DOING A GRAPHIC NOVEL?
I WANTED -- MY DREAM WAS TO MAKE A MOVIE OF IT. YOU KNOW, TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT GERONIMO. BUT I REALIZED HOW HARD IT WOULD BE, AND HOW DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE IT WOULD BE. AND MY SON IS REALLY INTO GRAPHIC NOVELS. I WAS BUYING THEM FOR HIM TO GET HIM READING, INTERESTED IN READING. AND I SAW THIS ONE, "CONAN: BORN ON THE BATTLEFIELD," DRAWN BY GREG RUTH. AND I WAS JUST BLOWN AWAY BY ALL THE EMOTION IN IT AND HOW POETIC IT WAS. AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, WAIT A A SECOND, MAYBE IT'S NOT A A MOVIE, MAYBE IT'S A GRAPHIC NOVEL."

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME!
THANK YOU, SIR!
Jimmy: THANK FOR COMING ON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY LOVE YOU, BUDDY. THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THIS SHOW.
I APPRECIATE IT.
Jimmy: I WANT TO ASK YOU, BECAUSE WE JUST DID AN "FML" BIT EARLIER.
AH, YES. WHAT DOES "FML" STAND FOR?
Jimmy: UH, "MY LIFE." IT'S NOT BORAT. "MY LIFE!"
"MY LIFE!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, FML. DO YOU HAVE ANY -- YOU HAVE TO HAVE ANY FML STORIES. EVERYONE HAS ONE.
YEAH, THAT SUCKS TO HAVE TO TELL THAT STORY.
Jimmy: COME ON! PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR IT THOUGH.
WOW, OKAY. MOST HUMILIATING MOMENT EVER. SO, I WAS 17 YEARS OLD, FULL OF TESTOSTERONE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
POST-PUBESCENT. ALL RIGHT, POST-PUBESCENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
I HAD HAIR IN THE RIGHT PLACES. AND THOSE -- [ LAUGHTER ] I DID. [ CHEERS ] THERE WAS THIS --
Jimmy: YOUR BACK? [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY, WE GOT THAT COVERED. WELL, I DON'T -- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.
THERE WAS THIS GIRL. HER NAME WAS JAMIE. I WON'T SAY HER LAST NAME, IN CASE SHE'S MARRIED WITH KIDS NOW. BUT I HAD A BIG-TIME CRUSH ON HER. SHE WAS A SOCCER GIRL. I HAD A THING FOR SOCCER GIRLS, AND SHE CAME OVER TO MY HOUSE TO TALK TO ME. SO, I WAS LIKE, "OOH." I WAS A LOSER IN HIGH SCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ] GIRLS DIDN'T TALK TO THE GUY WHO PLAYED "DUNGEONS & DRAGONS" AND THOUGHT KARATE WAS COOL. [ CHEERS ] NOW, IT'S LIKE, "OOH, THE UFC. OH, HE PLAYS VIDEO GAMES? SO DO I." BUT BACK THEN, NOT COOL.
Jimmy: YOU WERE NOT COOL, NO.
SO JAMIE COMES OVER TO THE HOUSE. I'M TALKING TO HER ON THE FRONT PORCH. MY MOM HAD, LIKE, THE GREENEST THUMB EVER. EVEN IN ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO, SHE COULD GROW ANYTHING. AND SHE HAD A GIANT BARREL THAT SHE WAS GOING TO FILL WITH SOIL AND PUT SOME PLANTS IN AND MAKE LOOK NICE. I'M SPITTING MY BEST 16-YEAR-OLD GAME TO THIS GIRL, AND TRY TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT I DON'T LIKE TO BE COOL. BECAUSE IF I MENTION SOMETHING I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT, SHE'S GONE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I'M TALKING TO HER, AND IT'S GOING GREAT. LIKE, EVERYTHING'S COOL. AND SHE'S LIKE, "OH, YEAH, LA DA DA." SHE HAD BLONDE HAIR AND FRECKLES AND REAL CUTE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I TOOK ONE STEP BACKWARD, AND THE BARREL WAS BEHIND ME. AND YOU KNOW HOW YOU SEE THE BODY JUST FOLD UP LIKE THIS? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LIKE A FLIP PHONE.
NOW, I GOT AIR JORDANS ON, SO NO MATTER WHAT, IT WILL LOOK COOL. BUT WHEN YOUR LEGS GO STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR AND YOU'RE LITERALLY KISSING YOUR KNEES, IT'S THE WORST. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE'S GOING, "OH, GOD! I'M SO SORRY! LET ME HELP YOU!" YOUR MALE PRIDE'S LIKE, "NO, NO, NO! I GOT IT! PLEASE GO! PLEASE LEAVE! PLEASE LEAVE!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S ACTUALLY HARD TO GET OUT OF THAT SITUATION, YEAH.
SO, SHE ACTUALLY LEFT. AND I WAS LIKE, "NO, YOU HAVE TO GO! I'M FINE! I'LL GET OUT AS SOON AS YOU LEAVE! YOU JUST HAVE TO GO, GO, GO!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD! SO YOU STARTED YELLING AT HER FROM IN A BARREL?
YES, SO SHE LEFT, AND I LITERALLY HAD A GOOD SIX OR SEVEN MINUTES OF WIGGLING LEFT TO RIGHT UNTIL THE BARREL FREAKING FELL OVER AND I COULD CRAWL OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THAT'S WAS THE ONLY WAY OUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT BAD. THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.
THANK YOU!
Jimmy: BECAUSE YOU'RE BASICALLY JUST SCREAMING AT YOUR CROTCH, "GO AWAY! GO AWAY! DON'T LOOK AT ME! DON'T TALK TO ME ANYMORE!"
THAT'S A GREAT IMPRESSION OF ME.
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
THAT'S AWESOME.
Jimmy: I HAVE A LOT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. FIRST ALL, YOU WROTE A A COOKBOOK.
I DID WRITE A COOKBOOK.
Jimmy: NOW, WHAT MADE YOU WRITE A COOKBOOK? I'M PSYCHED ABOUT THIS.
MY WIFE TRIED TO GET ME TO WRITE ONE FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS. BUT AS WE DO, THE PERSON CLOSEST TO YOU WHO GIVES YOU THE BEST ADVICE, YOU REJECT CATEGORICALLY.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE.
AND IT'S NOT UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA?" AND YOU GO, "YEAH! A COOKBOOK! THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!" AND SARAH GOES, "YEAH, ISN'T IT?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THERE'S ONE STORY IN HERE THAT I THINK IS VERY INTERESTING ON PAGE 55.
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: VEAL PICCATA.
SO, I'VE NEVER SAID THIS ACTOR'S NAME BEFORE. BUT, I LOVE HIM AND HE'S A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. I DON'T SAY IT IN THE BOOK, BUT I'LL SAY IT NOW. I DID A PLAY, THANKS TO YOUR FREAKING FATHER, WHO GOT ME SO DRUNK THAT I AGREED TO DO A A PLAY IN LONDON WITH SOME PRODUCER WHO I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CALM DOWN! I'M NOT YOUR -- I'M NOT YOUR CROTCH! DON'T YELL AT ME LIKE THAT.
SO, I END UP --
Jimmy: I SAID THAT A A THOUSAND TIMES. IF I HAD A PENNY FOR EVERY TIME I SAID THAT.
SO I ENDED UP IN LONDON DOING A PLAY WITH CHRIS KLEIN, AND I TOOK HIM TO MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT OUT THERE. THEY MADE THIS VEAL PICCATA DISH. I BECAME FRIENDS WITH THE CHEF, AND HE ACTUALLY TAUGHT ME TO MAKE IT. AND WE WERE THERE, AND WE HAD A A FEW DRINKS. AND, WE'RE IN THE ELEVATOR GOING DOWN -- QUITE A FEW DRINKS. AND WE WERE IN OUR 20s. IT WAS ALL RIGHT. AND WE WERE IN THE ELEVATOR, AND THERE WAS THIS BRITISH GUY WITH THIS GIRL IN THERE. AND HE SAYS, "OH" -- HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE US, AND HE HEARD US TALKING, BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH DRUNK AND LOUD, AND AS YOU CAN TELL, I DON'T SHUT UP. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE GUY GOES, "OH, SO YOU'RE AMERICAN? AMERICAN?" AND CHRIS GOES, "U.S.A., BABY." [ LAUGHTER ] THE GUY GOES, "WHAT PHONY AMERICAN ACCENTS." AND HE WALKS AWAY. AND CHRIS GETS HOT. HE'S LIKE, "YO, THAT GUY THINKS WE'RE FAKE AMERICANS!" [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, "SO WHAT?" AND THE GUY LEAVES --
Jimmy: SUCH A DRUNK PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: "STOP, TAKE A A BREATH."
THANK YOU FOR RELATING TO IT. SO WE WENT OUT A DIFFERENT WAY, BUT SURE ENOUGH, THEY HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SAME PATH. THIS PATH WE WENT DOWN THE THAMES RIVER. AND CHRIS, HE HAD ON SNEAKERS, I HAD ON NICE SHOES, SO HE WAS FASTER THAT DAY. AND HE RAN DOWN THE BOARD WALK, GRABBED THIS GUY, AND BY THE TIME I CATCH UP, HE'S SHAKING HIM. CHRIS, I'M SO SORRY I'M TELLING THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVE YOU, BROTHER. AND HE'S SHAKING THE GUY. HE GOES, "SAY I HAVE A FAKE ACCENT NOW!" THE GUY'S LIKE, "I DON'T UNDERSTAND!"
Jimmy: "I DON'T EVEN CARE! I DON'T EVEN GIVE A CRAP!"
HE'S LITERALLY LIKE -- AND HIS GIRLFRIEND'S LIKE, "OH, MY GOD! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "YOU HAVE A FAKE ACCENT TOO!" [ LAUGHTER ] FIN -- FINALLY, HE GRABS THE GUY AND JUST LAUNCHES HIM. AND THE GUY'S IN THE AIR LONG ENOUGH, MEANING WE'RE UP ABOVE THE RIVER, HIGH ENOUGH, THAT I CAN HEAR THIS POOR BASTARD SCREAM, "NO!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SPLASH! INTO THE RIVER.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS.
IT'S WINTERTIME.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS.
I HAVE TO RUN DOWN THE BANK. I WAS DRESSED NICE. I HAD GOOD SHOES. I HAD AN ARMANI JACKET. I WAS FEELING GOOD. NOW I'M WET, DIRTY, MAD GROSS. I PULLED THIS GUY OUT. NOW I'M MAD AT HIM.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I WAS DRUNK TOO, BUT I'M LIKE, "YOU HAD TO SAY HE HAD A A FAKE ACCENT, YOU DUMB SON OF A BITCH!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? LEAVE ME ALONE!"
SO HIS GIRL CAUGHT UP --
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, I'M FROM NEW JERSEY. SO I'VE BEEN JOKING AROUND, TOO. [ LAUGHTER ]
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD.
HIS GIRL CAME UP. THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY. AND, YOU KNOW, CHRIS AND I HAD A LONG TALK ON THE WAY HOME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD! THAT IS THE CRAZIEST STORY I EVER HEARD. AND SOMEHOW MY DAD GOT CONNECTED TO THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE WHOLE STORY'S IN THERE. THESE ARE FANTASTIC RECIPES, AND CONGRATS ON DOING THIS, BECAUSE IT'S JUST FUN, AND IT HAD GOOD RECIPES IN HERE. BUT ALSO, CONGRATS ON THE SHOW AS WELL.
YEAH, MAN, IT'S WITH DANA CARVEY, BRO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I GET TO PUSH THE DANA BUTTON. I LITERALLY CAN JUST TURN HIM INTO THE CHURCH LADY. TURN HIM INTO GEORGE BUSH.
Jimmy: HE DOES EVERY --
TURN HIM INTO ANYBODY, AND NOBODY GETS THE BUTTON BUT ME!
Jimmy: OH, HE'S THE GREATEST.
IT'S VERY, VERY FUNNY. IT'S BASICALLY, IMPRESSIONISTS DOING IMPROV.
Jimmy: WHOEVER WINS BASED ON AUDIENCE APPLAUSE GETS 10 GRAND?
YEAH, IT'S A LEGIT VOTE. I DON'T GET TO PICK. THEY DO. AND IT'S A SINK-OR-SWIM KIND OF SHOW, MAN. IT'S A LOT OF -- I GO TO A COMEDY CLUB AND WATCH PEOPLE MAKE ME LAUGH, BASICALLY. THAT'S MY JOB. IT'S AWESOME.
