THE NEW MOVIE "NOAH" COMES OUT THIS WEEKEND, AND I READ THAT IT'S EXPECTED TO BE NUMBER ONE AT THE BOX OFFICE. THIS FOLLOWS THE STORY OF A A FAMILY TRYING TO SURVIVE GOD'S WRATH ON A GIANT BOAT FOR MONTHS. OR AS THAT'S MORE COMMONLY KNOWN, A CARNIVAL CRUISE? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. IT TELLS THE STORY OF A MAN WHO TAKES ON A MASSIVE PROJECT THAT NO ONE BELIEVES IN, OR AS OBAMA PUT IT, "BEEN THERE." [ LAUGHTER ] THE MOVIE "NOAH," THOUGH, MIGHT GET SOME COMPETITION FROM ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S NEW FILM "SABOTAGE." THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S GOD VERSUS SCHWARZENEGGER.
