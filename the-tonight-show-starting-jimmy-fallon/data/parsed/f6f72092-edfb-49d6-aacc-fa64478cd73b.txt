Jimmy: AH-HA. THANK YOU, MR. CENA! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CHECKMATE MY FRIEND. YOU'RE THE GREATEST. WHAT IS THE SHOW ABOUT? BECAUSE YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT BETTER THAN I CAN.
YES. WE HAVE FOUR DECORATED MILITARY HEROES, WE'VE GOT A NAVY SEAL COMMANDER, A SERGEANT FROM THE UNITED STATES ARMY, A 19 YEAR GUNNERY SERGEANT FROM THE MARINE CORPS WHO'S A FEMALE AND BADASS, AND WE GOT AN ARMY RANGER SNIPER AND THEY'RE EACH GOING TO LEAD TEAMS OF FOUR NORMAL CIVILIANS THROUGH THESE MILITARY TEAMBUILDING CHALLENGES. NOW, YOU WATCH THE CRAZY, OUTLANDISH REALITY COMPETITION SERIES, THERE'S JUST A REALLY GOOD MORAL DNA TO THIS BECAUSE IF YOU LISTEN TO THE MILITARY HEROES WE'VE GOT, THEY THINK THERE IS A LARGE GAP BETWEEN MILITARY FOLKS AND CIVILIANS. AND THESE GUYS HAVE SO MUCH REAL LIFE EXPERIENCES BEING IN SOME CRISIS SITUATIONS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND HAVING TO MANAGE LARGE GROUPS TO MOVE EFFICIENTLY. SO IT'S BASICALLY THAT PASSAGE OF KNOWLEDGE SO THESE CIVILIANS CAN KIND OF LEARN THROUGH THESE MENTORS AND EVOLVE THROUGH THIS CHALLENGE AND IF THEY CAN MAKE IT TO THE END, WELL THEY GET A A HEFTY PAYCHECK. THEY COULD WIN UP TO A A MILLION BUCKS. SO IT'S REALLY COOL TO SEE THESE REALLY DECORATED HEROES PASS ON SOME KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS REALLY BEEN KEPT TO THE MILITARY TO THESE CIVILIANS AND LET THEM SOLVE THESE TEAMBUILDING EXERCISES IN A WAY THAT'S -- NOTHING LIKE ITS ON TV. IT REALLY IS A SPECIAL SHOW.
Jimmy: AND THE GUYS THAT YOU HAVE LEARNING THE LESSONS, WHOEVER DID THE CASTING DESERVES AN AWARD. BECAUSE THAT, I MEAN, YOU GOT SOME REAL CHARACTERS.
THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERSONALITIES.
Jimmy: THERE'S CHARACTERS ON THIS SHOW.
YES, THERE IS.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
BUT HONESTLY, THROUGH IT ALL -- THROUGH IT ALL. AND THE GOAL OF THIS WAS TO GET THESE TYPE OF CHARACTERS AND LITERALLY YOU CAN WATCH THEM EVOLVE THROUGH THIS JOURNEY. THEY MAY START ONE WAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
