Jimmy: WAIT, EXPLORE JFK IN HIS ON-STAGE -- I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE JFK.
LOOKS LIKE A GROUCHY, OVER-TIRED JFK.
Jimmy: THIS IS NOT YOU, REMOTELY.
NO, IT IS HOWEVER ANOTHER MAN NAMED MICHAEL SHANNON. A FINE ACTOR NAMED MICHAEL SHANNON WHO YEARS AGO, REACHED OUT TO ME VERY -- BY MAIL, VIA POST, AND SAID, "HI, I'M AN ACTOR NAMED MICHAEL SHANNON AND I HAVE BEEN AROUND A LITTLE LONGER THAN YOU, AND I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD CHANGE YOUR NAME. 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE SOME DAY THIS IS GOING TO CAUSE HUGE PROBLEMS FOR BOTH OF US." AND LOOK --

AT LEAST IT'S NOT IN FRENCH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EXACTLY. IT'S IN ENGLISH. YOU CAN TALK, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND EVERYBODY.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT, GOSH, YOU PLAY LIKE AN UNLIKABLE CHARACTER IN THIS FILM.
HE HAS TO, UNFORTUNATELY, DURING THE MORTGAGE CRISIS THAT STRUCK US A FEW YEARS BACK, MY CHARACTER, RICK CARVER, HAS THE UNFORTUNATE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVICTING PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN FORECLOSED UPON. AND SO THAT'S NOT --
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT A FUN JOB.
NOT A PLEASANT THING TO DO.
Jimmy: NO, BUT MAN, YOU'RE GREAT IN THE FILM. AND I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A A CLIP HERE. HERE'S MICHAEL SHANNON'S CHARACTER EXPLAINING HOW HE THINKS AMERICA WORKS IN "99 HOMES." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
YOU THINK AMERICA 2 2010 GIVES A FLYING RAT'S ASS ABOUT CARVER OR NASH? UH-HUH. AMERICA DOESN'T BAIL OUT THE LOSERS. AMERICA WAS BUILT BY BAILING OUT WINNERS. BY RIGGING A NATION OF THE WINNERS FOR THE WINNERS BY THE WINNERS. YOU GO TO CHURCH, NASH? YOU GO TO CHURCH?
SURE.
