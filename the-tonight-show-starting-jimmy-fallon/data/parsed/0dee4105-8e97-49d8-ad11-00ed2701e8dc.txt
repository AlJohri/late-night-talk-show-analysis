Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WELCOME, PLEASE. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. PLEASE, SIT DOWN, ENJOY YOURSELF. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT! YEAH, ALL RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NEW YORK CITY, BABY. LOVE IT. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. GUYS, IT IS THE FIRST DAY OF FEBRUARY. [ CHEERS ] WHICH OF COURSE IS THE SHORTEST MONTH WITH JUST 28 DAYS AS OPPOSED TO JANUARY. WHICH FELT LIKE IT HAD 200. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS, HERE. LAST NIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP NOMINATED COLORADO APPEALS JUDGE NEIL GORSUCH TO THE SUPREME COURT. THAT'S RIGHT, HE'S FROM COLORADO. WHICH EXPLAINS HIS MOST FAMOUS CASE. REGULAR FUNYUNS VS. FLAMIN' HOT FUNYUNS. [ LAUGHTER ] "I HEREBY RULE, THAT THEY'RE BOTH AWESOME." WE'RE NOW LEARNING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT NEIL GORSUCH. FOR INSTANCE, I READ THAT HE ACTUALLY HAS A BARN WHERE HE RAISES HORSES, CHICKENS AND GOATS. THAT EXPERIENCE WILL COME IN HANDY WHEN HE SPENDS THE REST OF HIS LIFE SIDE-STEPPING ALL THE CRAP IN WASHINGTON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LISTEN TO THIS. AHEAD OF LAST NIGHT'S BIG SUPREME COURT ANNOUNCEMENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP BROUGHT BOTH OF HIS TOP TWO CANDIDATES TO THE WHITE HOUSE. YEAH. TRUMP SAID, "ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE NOMINEE, THE OTHER WILL GO HOME CRYING IN THE BACK OF A A LIMO." [ LAUGHTER ] WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? HE DID IT. TRUMP ALSO BROUGHT HIS SECOND CHOICE, THOMAS HARDIMAN, ALL THE WAY TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BUILD SUSPENSE FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, HERE'S WHAT THE TWO OF THEM HAD TO SAY AFTER THE BIG REVEAL. FIRST GORSUCH SAID, "THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE." THEN HARDIMAN SAID, "WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?" [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT GORSUCH SAID, "THIS WAS A A DREAM COME TRUE." AND HARDIMAN SAID, "THIS IS THE CRUELEST THING ANYONE COULD DO. INVITING ME TO A PARTY AND THEN NOT PUTTING MY NAME ON THE LIST." FINALLY GORSUCH SAID, "I CAN'T EXPRESS HOW HAPPY I AM." WHILE HARDIMAN SAID, "I CAN'T EXPRESS HOW MUCH I REGRET GETTING A LOWER BACK TATTOO THAT SAYS, 'JUSTICE SUPREME.' [ APPLAUSE ] SHOULD'VE TOLD ME BEFORE I GOT THE TAT." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, A SOURCE TOLD "US WEEKLY" THAT MELANIA TRUMP IS GOING TO WAIT UNTIL LATER IN THE YEAR TO DECIDE IF SHE'LL MOVE TO WASHINGTON. YEP. SHE SAID IT DEPENDS ON A LOT OF FACTORS, LIKE IF HER HUSBAND IS STILL PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE. YESTERDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED RUDY GIULIANI QUOTE, "VERY MUCH OF AN EXPERT ON CYBER SECURITY." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS TRUE IF THAT SENTENCE ENDED WITH, COMPARED TO ME.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THEN, YEAH. OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. COMPARED TO YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS WEEK WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER SPOKE OUT AGAINST CRITICISM OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. THOUGH I'M NOT SURE HE CLEARED ANYTHING UP. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
LET ME JUST WALK THROUGH THIS REAL QUICK. THIS IS THE 2009 MEMO. AND THEN THIS ONE IS THE -- I'VE GOT THE '13 HERE AS WELL -- OR THE 2017, RATHER. AND THIS IS THE 2001 WITH RESPECT TO -- UM -- UH -- OVER -- UH -- I THINK IT IS PRETTY CLEAR IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THREE OF THESE, UH, THAT'S WHAT IT DOES. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY.
Jimmy: "UH, THEN, UH, IN 2000 -- UH, 2007'S ANOTHER YEAR AND 2006 IS A YEAR, TOO. AND, 2010'S A YEAR." IN HIS DEFENSE THOUGH, IT'S HARD TO KEEP ALL THOSE ALTERNATIVE FACTS STRAIGHT. YOU KNOW -- THERE'S NO REAL ORDER, SO --
Steve: YOU DON'T KNOW. [ APPLAUSE ] WE DO NOT KNOW.
Jimmy: AND THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY, 41% OF AMERICANS THINK GOD PLAYS A A ROLE IN U.S. ELECTIONS. AND GOD SAID, "ACTUALLY, I JUST FOCUS ON FOOTBALL AND 'THE BACHELOR.' BUT YOU KNOW, WHATEVER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE EVERYONE IS STILL GEARING UP FOR SUPER BOWL LI. AND ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M PSYCHED, MAN. THIS SUNDAY. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CHICKEN COUNCIL, AMERICANS WILL EAT OVER A BILLION CHICKEN WINGS ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH, AND AS MANY AS THREE PIECES OF CELERY.

Jimmy: XLV, OKAY. I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. DOUG, LET ME ASK YOU. HOW DO YOU THINK THIS YEAR'S SUPER BOWL WILL COMPARE TO SUPER BOWL EXTRA LARGE?
WELL, I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT COMPARISON. WHAT I HAVE HEARD ARE COMPARISONS TO SUPER BOWL V. AND SUPER BOWL IV. AND SUPER BOWL III. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I'VE HEARD THOSE -- I'VE HEARD THOSE SAME COMPARISONS.
YES. BUT NO MATTER WHO WINS OR LOSES, LET'S JUST HOPE THAT THE SUPER BOWL IS AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. SO OUR GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT GRANDCHILDREN MAY ONE DAY LIVE TO SEE SUPER BOWL MMMDKKKXLK.

THAT'S WHY WE'RE MAN'S BEST FRIEND." THEN THIS CAT SAID, "ACTUALLY YOU'RE MAN'S BEST FRIEND, JUST BECAUSE YOU DO WHATEVER HE TELLS YOU. THAT'S NOT INTELLIGENCE, THAT'S BLIND OBEDIENCE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEN THE DOG SAID, "YOU TALK A A BIG GAME FOR SOMEONE THAT FALLS FOR THE LASER POINTER TRICK EVERY SINGLE TIME." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN THE CAT SAID, "UH, DON'T YOU HAVE A STRANGER'S LEG TO HUMP OR A CAR TO CHASE?" TO WHICH THE DOG SAID, "MEOW." TO WHICH THE CAT REPLIED, "THAT'S MY LINE." TO WHICH THE DOG SAID, "NO, I'M SAYING IT, LIKE, BITCHY LIKE, 'MEOW.'" THE CAT WAS LIKE, "OH, RIGHT, WELL ACTUALLY THAT'S PRETTY SMART." AND THEN THE DOG WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT -- [ VACUUM SOUNDS ] WAIT, WHAT'S THAT NOISE?" THEN THE CAT RESPONDED, "VACUUM CLEANER! WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE." AND FINALLY, THE GOLDFISH SAID, "MORONS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS AN -- IT WAS A RIVETING INTERVIEW.
Steve: WOW. THAT'S A GREAT INTERVIEW.
Jimmy: WELL THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD, YOU GUYS. ON FRIDAY POLICE IN WASHINGTON STATE STOPPED A MAN WHO WAS JOGGING NUDE AROUND MICROSOFT'S CAMPUS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. WHEN WITNESSES WERE ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE SUSPECT, THEY SAID, "MICRO -- SOFT." [ LAUGHTER ]

I DO. I DO.
Jimmy: THAT'S EXCITING.
I THREW OUT THE FIRST PITCH AT THE METS GAME. AND THEN TODAY, THEY DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME, THEY JUST PUT IT ONLINE THAT THEY TURNED IT INTO A BASEBALL CARD.
Jimmy: THEY HAVE CELEBRITIES WHO THROW OUT THE FIRST PITCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THERE YOU ARE. THAT'S THE DEBUT. THAT'S THE CARD.
YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ARE YOU FREAKING OUT? THAT'S SO COOL.
LOOK AT THE CARGO SHORTS.
Jimmy: I KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU THINK THEY COULD HAVE CROPPED THAT OUT FOR THE CARD. YOU KNOW?
HERE'S THE THING. IT DID NOT GO THAT WELL. IT WENT TERRIBLY. THIS IS THE MOMENT BEFORE THE DISASTER.
Jimmy: IT WAS NOT GOOD.
IT DID NOT GO WELL BECAUSE I AM NOT AN ATHLETE. I'M TERRIBLE THAT WAY. I'M NOT IN GOOD SHAPE. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THIS EXPRESSION DAD BOD? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YES. OF COURSE.
THAT'S LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE KIND OF A CRAPPY BODY, LIKE YOU WORK OUT, BUT A LITTLE. AND SOMEONE SENT ME AN ARTICLE ABOUT IT AND I HIT THE LINK. IT WAS A LONG ARTICLE ABOUT IT, BUT THE MAIN PICTURE WAS OF ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: KIND OF A COMPLIMENT. YOU'RE FAMOUS. WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, IT'S SCARY NOW BECAUSE YOU SEE ALL THE BLOOPERS ONLINE OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE THROWING IT. LIKE BABA BOOEY AND STUFF. AND THEN I MEET ALL THE METS BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THEM BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING THAT CAREFULLY. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS SOMEONE WHO NEVER PLAYS OR THE BIGGEST STAR ON THE TEAM. AND THEN ONLY PERSON I'M COMFORTABLE WITH IS THE MASCOT, MR. MET. THAT'S THE ONLY ONE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU BONDED WITH HIM?
I BONDED WITH HIM. I BONDED WITH HIM. BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH IN SHOW BUSINESS. WE'RE BOTH IN SHOW --
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU ARE BOTH IN SHOW BUSINESS. AND IN SOME WAYS, ABSOLUTELY YEAH.
SO THEY SAY, OKAY, YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT TO THE MOUND. AND THEN YOU THROW THE PITCH. AND I RUN OUT TO THE MOUND. AND I'M ASSUMING SOMEONE'S GOING TO BE THERE TO TELL ME SOMETHING ELSE. BUT NO ONE IS THERE EXCEPT IN THE OUTFIELD IS JACOB deGROM, THE PITCHER.
Jimmy: SURE. ABSOLUTELY.
SO I DON'T WHAT TO DO. I JUST RUN OVER TO HIM. I DON'T KNOW WHY. I JUST RAN OVER TO HIM LIKE SHAKE HIS HAND OR SOMETHING. AND HE HAD LIKE EYE OF THE TIGER. LIKE I'M ABOUT TO PITCH AGAINST THE YANKEES, GET THE "F" AWAY FROM ME RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. NO. I'M NOT HERE TO MEET PEOPLE, RIGHT NOW. YEAH, GET OUT OF HERE.

Jimmy: OR 17, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
AND IT'S FUN NOW BECAUSE I HAD STORIES BUT WHEN I WAS A A KID, I HAD NOTHING. I WAS TERRIBLE.
Jimmy: OH, I'M STILL TERRIBLE AT STAND-UP. NO -- I HAVE NO STORIES. I WAS TRYING TO WRITE BITS AND CAUSE YOU ARE SO YOUNG. YOU REALLY DON'T -- DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR FIRST JOKE OR ANYTHING?
I REMEMBER I ALWAYS BOMBED AND MY CLOSING LINE WAS THE SAME EVERY TIME AFTER A A TERRIBLE BOMB. I WOULD SAY, "JERRY LEWIS ALWAYS SAID, YOU LEARN NOTHING FROM BEING FUNNY." YOU ONLY LEARN FROM NOT BEING FUNNY. SO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME A A COLLEGE EDUCATION TONIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
