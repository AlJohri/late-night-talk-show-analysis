Questlove: SHOW 200!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE! THAT'S THE LOVE! THAT'S THE ENERGY WE NEED. THE WORLD NEEDS THIS LOVE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. OH, MY GOSH. WHAT A SHOW WE HAVE TONIGHT. [ CHEERS ] UNBELIEVABLE SHOW. UNBELIEVABLE SHOW. BLAKE SHELTON IS HERE TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE BOB COSTAS HERE TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND WE'VE GOT MOTLEY CRUE HERE TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE GOING TO BREAK THE BUILDING. I'M SO EXCITED. YEAH. GUYS, WELCOME, WELCOME. AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANKS FOR WATCHING AT HOME. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WAS IN THE NEWS. HE RECENTLY SAID THAT HE PRIVATELY MET WITH 17 REPUBLICAN SENATORS AT HIS HOME TO TRY AND CONNECT WITH ISSUES LIKE TAX REFORM. BIDEN ASKED WHAT HE CAN DO TO SPEED UP NEGOTIATIONS, WHILE DEMOCRATS ASKED IS THIS DOOR LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE? [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S IN THERE NOW, RIGHT? JOE BIDEN SAID HE'S MET WITH SOME REPUBLICAN SENATORS AT HIS HOME TO TRY AND CONNECT ON ISSUES LIKE TAX REFORM AND -- BECAUSE HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO BE HOME ALONE ANYMORE. PARTY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ TARIQ! ♪♪
Tariq: HIGGINS! ♪♪
Steve: JAMES! ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GO, HIT IT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ GIVE ME THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GO HAVE FUN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELL, THIS IS VERY INTERESTING HERE. I SAW THAT ONE OF THE MOST GOOGLED QUESTIONS DURING THIS WEEK'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS WAS "HOW MUCH DOES THE PRESIDENT MAKE?" WHEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS $400,000 A YEAR, MITT ROMNEY WAS LIKE, "I'M OUT." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS BIG NEWS. YESTERDAY, THE SENATE VOTED 98-1 ON AN AMENDMENT THAT STATES CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND IS NOT A HOAX. 98-1. [ LAUGHTER ] 98-1, YEAH. THE ONLY PERSON TO VOTE "NO" WAS MISSISSIPPI SENATOR ROGER WICKER. THAT'S NOT THAT SURPRISING BECAUSE WICKER'S BEEN KNOWN TO TAKE LESS POPULAR STANCES ON MANY ISSUES. I MEAN, LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS HE'S SAID IN THE PAST. WICKER ONCE SAID, "THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN GETTING INTO AN EMPTY ELEVATOR WITH A A CO-WORKER YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.
Steve: THAT'S NOT GOOD
Jimmy: THAT CAN'T BE REAL. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW'S YOUR SUMMER?
Steve: NOT GOOD.
Jimmy: HE ALSO SAID "T.G.I.M. AM I RIGHT? LOVE ME SOME MONDAY." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE OFF ANYWHERE.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: WHAT IS HE DOING?
Steve: THAT'S ANTI-GARFIELD.
Jimmy: FINALLY, HE SAID -- WICKER SAID, "EVER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO SNEEZE BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN? LOVE THAT." [ LAUGHTER ] HE LIKES TO ZIG WHEN EVERYONE ELSE ZAGS. PRESIDENT OBAMA VISITED BOISE STATE YESTERDAY TO KICK OFF HIS POST-STATE OF THE UNION TOUR. AND HE WAS PRETTY IMPRESSED BY WHAT HE SAW AT A COLLEGE. CHECK IT OUT.
I HAD A CHANCE TO TOUR YOUR NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT LAB. AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, THIS WAS NOT THE STUFF I WAS DOING IN COLLEGE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEN, HE WAS LIKE, "BY THE WAY, DOES ANYONE HAVE A A BAG OF STUFF WE WERE DOING IN COLLEGE? I'M ON MY WAY OUT. I MIGHT AS WELL NOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M ON MY WAY OUT!" OF COURSE, WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON, THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS JUST WANT CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT TO WORK TOGETHER AND TRY TO GET SOME STUFF DONE. AND IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING SOME COMPROMISES. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IN TONIGHT'S EDITION OF "SPLITTING THE DIFF." ♪ SPLIT THE DIFF ♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FIRST COMPROMISE. THE DEMOCRATS WANT A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET. OKAY? THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO REPEAL OBAMACARE. THEY COMPROMISED AND NOW IF YOU'RE SICK YOU'LL HAVE TO RELY ON WEBMD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HONEY. HONEY, I THINK I GOT SCURVY. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, NO. NO, I'M PREGNANT. YOU HAVE SCURVY. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. THE REPUBLICANS WANT THE KEYSTONE XL OIL PIPELINE TO CREATE JOBS. THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. THEY COMPROMISED AND NOW THE PIPELINE WILL BE BUILT BY UNION POLAR BEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE GOING TO GET THEM TOGETHER. EVERYONE WINS. COMPROMISE IS KEY. LET'S KEEP GOING. THE DEMOCRATS WANT HIGHER STANDARDS FOR CLEAN DRINKING WATER. THE REPUBLICANS WANT MORE GUN RIGHTS. THEY COMPROMISED. NOW, U.S. CITIZENS WILL BE REQUIRED TO CARRY A WATER GUN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT'S NOT WATER.
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, DEMOCRATS WANT TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA. THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO CLOSE THE BORDERS. SO, THE COMPROMISE IS TO GET HIGH AND MAKE A RUN FOR TACO BELL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S JUST THE WAY EVERYONE WINS. EVERYONE WINS THAT WAY. JUST DO IT. OF COURSE, YOU PROBABLY HEARD THAT THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS WERE ACCUSED OF DEFLATING THEIR BALLS -- [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] DURING THE GAME THIS WEEK. WELL, THE SCANDAL'S GOTTEN SO BAD THAT HEAD COACH BILL BELICHICK HAD TO HOLD A A PRESS CONFERENCE ABOUT IT. WELL, HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
THE BALLS WE PRACTICE WITH ARE AS BAD AS THEY CAN BE. WET, STICKY, COLD, SLIPPERY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WHOA.
Jimmy: STICKY. THAT'S ALSO THE MOST POPULAR LINE FROM THE "FIFTY SHADES OF GREY" MOVIE THAT'S COMING OUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SAME LINE. WELL, LET'S HEAR WHAT TOM BRADY HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT.
WHEN I FELT THEM, THEY WERE PERFECT. I MEAN, I WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE TOUCHING THOSE. I WOULD ZIP THOSE THINGS UP AND LOCK THEM AWAY UNTIL I GOT OUT ON THE FIELD AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH THEM. AND THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS DOING. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ZIP IT UP.
Steve: ZIP IT UP.
Jimmy: ZIP IT UP. DON'T LET ANYONE ELSE TOUCH THEM.
Steve: THEY WON'T PLAY WITH 'EM.
Jimmy: THAT'S A SMART MOVE. ZIP IT UP AND DON'T LET ANYONE TOUCH 'EM. HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS HERE. AS GAS PRICES CONTINUE TO DROP ACROSS THE U.S., 28 STATES ARE NOW SELLING REGULAR GASOLINE FOR LESS THAN $2 A GALLON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S GETTING CHEAPER TO PUMP TWO GALLONS OF GAS OUTSIDE THE STATION THAN IT IS TO PUMP TWO SQUIRTS OF NACHO CHEESE INSIDE. THAT'S WEIRD WHEN THAT HAPPENS. [ APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, THIS IS SOME COOL NEWS. THE NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK THAT THEY ARE GOING BACK ON TOUR STARTING IN MAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I KNOW. NEW KIDS. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. SO, THE NEW KIDS ARE TOURING, GAS IS AT TWO BUCKS A GALLON, AND IT EVEN LOOKS LIKE WE MAY HAVE ANOTHER ROUND OF BUSH VERSUS CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT. IF I GET HOME AND FIND A STACK OF FREE AOL CDs IN THE MAIL, I'M PRETTY SURE I TRAVELED THROUGH TIME. AM I RIGHT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M A TIME TRAVELER! WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW! GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: THEY'RE COMING OUT. WE'RE GOING TO DO A GIANT, THREE-WAY LIP-SYNC BATTLE. [ AUDIENCE OOHs ] THEY BETTER BRING THEIR "A" GAME, MAN, BECAUSE I'M GETTING READY. I'M READY TO DO IT UP.
Steve: GOT YOUR SONGS?

IT NEEDED TO BE SAID.
Jimmy: IT HAD TO BE SAID. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS DEFLATED BALL THING? WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY IN THE CATEGORY OF GAMESMENSHIP. THERE IS AN ACCEPTABLE RANGE, A A MINIMUM RANGE, A MAXIMUM RANGE TO WHICH THE BALLS CAN BE INFLATED, ALL RIGHT? AND BRADY LIKES IT AT THE LOWER END OF THAT. IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT SOMEBODY WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE BALLS MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IT A A LITTLE BIT -- EVERYTHING YOU SAY ABOUT THIS SOUNDS FUNNY, RIGHT? "SOMEONE'S IN CHARGE OF THE BALLS."
Jimmy: SOMEONE UNZIPPED THE BAG. [ LAUGHTER ]
RIGHT.
Jimmy: PULLED OUT SOME DEFLATED BALLS AND LET THEM PLAY WITH THEM FOR A FEW HOURS.
WELL SAID. AND THAT'S WHAT ROGER GOODELL MUST RULE ON.

I THINK THAT GAME COULD HAVE BEEN PLAYED WITH A BRICK OR A A BEACH BALL AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH THE SAME RESULT.
Jimmy: 45-7.
HERE'S THE THING. THE PATRIOTS HAVE BEEN SO GOOD FOR SO LONG THAT WHATEVER THEY MAY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST, AND SPYGATE IS SOMETHING THEY DID DO. WHATEVER THEY MAY HAVE DONE, THEY DIDN'T NEED TO DO. THEY HAVE A GREAT, GREAT COACH. A GREAT, GREAT QUARTERBACK. A GREAT ORGANIZATION.
Jimmy: I TOTALLY AGREE.
YOU DON'T NEED IT.
Jimmy: LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, WE WERE COMMENTING ON THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST PITCH. FIRST OF ALL, I ALWAYS TELL EVERYBODY DON'T GO OUT AND DO THE FIRST PITCH. IT JUST NEVER GOES WELL BECAUSE IT ALWAYS GOES CRAZY. IT REALLY DOES.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S A LOSE-LOSE SITUATION. AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT AND COMMENTED ON IT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A VERY GOOD ATHLETE, VERY GOOD BASKETBALL PLAYER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU CAN TELL IF SOMEONE HAS PLAYED BASEBALL OR NOT. BECAUSE EVEN LIKE CHARLES BARKLEY, A GREAT NBA HALL OF FAMER, HIS FIRST PITCH KIND OF INDICATES THAT HE HADN'T PLAYED MUCH BASEBALL. AND I'D THROWN OUT FIRST PITCHES BEFORE AT MINOR LEAGUE GAMES AND OTHER GAMES. AND THE CARDINALS ASKED ME TO THROW OUT A PITCH OF AS PART OF, AND THIS IS KEY --
Jimmy: WELL, LET ME JUST SAY THAT YOU ARE MR. ST. LOUIS. YOU DO SO MUCH FOR CHARITY AND ST. LOUIS.
YEAH, YOU WERE KIND ENOUGH TO COME IN.
Jimmy: SO, THIS IS IT. SO, YOU'RE THERE. ST. LOUIS CARDINALS. YOU'RE THERE. AND HERE'S THE CLIP. HERE'S BOB COSTAS THROWING THE FIRST PITCH. HERE WE GO. WOW.
THE PITCH.
OH, BOB!
OKAY. SO, HERE'S THE DEAL, RIGHT? FIRST OF ALL, THAT ISN'T LIKE 50 CENT THROWING IT INTO THE GROUND.
Jimmy: IT'S 50 CENT, NOT "FITTY." THAT'S 50. YOU PRONOUNCE IT 50.
THOSE OF US WHO KNOW HIM. THOSE OF US WHO KNOW HIM --
Jimmy: IT'S "FITTY" SHADES OF GREY AND IT'S 50 CENT.
ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO. ANYWAYS, THAT ONE WAS JUST A A BIT OUTSIDE.
Jimmy: JUST A BIT OUTSIDE? THAT WAS IN A DIFFERENT STADIUM.
BUT AT LEAST IT GOT THERE.
Jimmy: HERE'S ANOTHER. THEN, YOU DO IT AGAIN.
THIS BETTER BE A STRIKE.
SEE, HE WENT WITH THE SLIDER.
Jimmy: THAT WAS A GOOD PITCH RIGHT THERE. THAT WAS FANTASTIC. [ APPLAUSE ] BUT WHY -- [ APPLAUSE ] WE'RE ALL WONDERING THIS. WHY DO YOU GET A DO-OVER?
WELL, HERE'S THE THING. SOME PEOPLE WERE ON ME LIKE I HAD VIOLATED THE SACRED PROTOCOL OF FIRST PITCHES. BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK, IT'S 6:40. THE GAME STARTED AT 7:15. FREDBIRD THE MASCOT'S ON THE FIELD. THERE'S A GROUNDSKEEPER WITH A A HOSE THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDER. SECOND BASE IS SITTING OUT IN THE OUTFIELD. SIX LITTLE KIDS FROM A A COMMUNITY CENTER THREW SUBSEQUENT FIRST PITCHES. WE WERE ACTUALLY SHOOTING A A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT ON BEHALF OF ST. LOUIS.
Jimmy: YOU'RE EYES ARE GETTING RED. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND THE IDEA WAS THAT JON HAMM HAD THROWN THE BALL ACROSS TOWN FROM THE SCIENCE CENTER AND I WAS GOING TO CATCH IT ON THE MOUND. WHICH IS WHY I HAD A.J. PIERZYNSKI THE CATCHER THROW IT TO ME. I CAUGHT IT. SO, WHEN THE FIRST PITCH WENT OFF A.J.'S GLOVE I REALIZED THEY DIDN'T HAVE A TAKE. SO, I ASKED FOR THE SECOND.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A A PROFESSIONAL.
WELL, YEAH, EXACTLY. AND IT ALL TOOK MAYBE TEN SECONDS. THE SECOND PITCH LUCKILY WAS A A STRIKE. SO NOW, THE NEXT DAY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, I FLY TO L.A. AND I'M AT THE BAGGAGE CAROUSEL AT L.A.X. AND UP COMES A GUY FROM "TMZ." AND HE STARTS TALKING TO ME AND HE SAYS, "SO HOW COME 50 CENT DOESN'T GET A SECOND CHANCE BUT YOU DO?" AND I SAY, "WELL, IF YOU SAW 50'S PITCH, YOU'D KNOW THAT IF HE HAD 50 CHANCES HE WASN'T GOING TO THROW A STRIKE." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I JUST NEEDED A SECOND CHANCE AND PERFECT PLATE-SPLITTING STRIKE. SO, HERE'S HOW "TMZ" PLAYS IT. "COSTAS DISSES 50 CENT." I DO NOT NEED 50 OR "FITTY" MAD AT ME.
Jimmy: HOWEVER HE WANTS TO --
I HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS.
Jimmy: YOU DO NOT NEED THAT.
I GOT 99 PROBLEMS AND I DON'T WANT 50 TO BE ONE.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. [ APPLAUSE ] I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU AT THE SUPER BOWL. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A A CLOSE GAME. ANYONE AHEAD OF THE OTHER? I DON'T KNOW.
RIGHT NOW VEGAS HAS IT AS A A TOSS-UP. YOU'VE GOT THE DEFENDING CHAMPIONS AGAINST A TEAM THAT'S GONE, GOING NOW TO ITS SIXTH IN 12 OR 13 YEARS. YOU'VE GOT TWO OF THE VERY BEST TEAMS. IT'S PROBABLY -- THE PACKERS WITH A HEALTHY AARON RODGERS WOULD HAVE ALSO BEEN A GOOD MATCHUP.
Jimmy: THAT WAS A BUMMER, MAN. THAT WAS A BUMMER.
THIS IS A TREMEDOUS SUPER BOWL MATCH UP.
Jimmy: HE WAS PLAYING SUCH A A GREAT GAME. IT WAS A BLOWOUT.
THEY OUTPLAYED THEM FOR 58 MINUTES AND THEN THE TRAP DOOR OPENED.
Jimmy: THAT WAS JUST ONE OF THE MOST INSANE GAMES I'VE SEEN.
YEAH, BIZARRE. TRULY BIZARRE. IF YOU REPLAYED THAT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS 100 TIMES, IT COULDN'T COME OUT THAT WAY AGAIN.
Jimmy: ANY OF THOSE FOUR TEAMS I WOULD BE HAPPY WITH. BECAUSE I THINK HALFTIME SHOULDN'T BE MUSIC. HOW LONG IS HALFTIME?
AN HOUR AND A HALF.
Jimmy: YOU SHOULD HAVE THE COLTS AND THE PACKERS GO IN THERE AND JUST PLAY ANOTHER FUN GAME FOR FUN. TWO TEAMS LEAVE. TWO TEAMS COME IN. I DON'T CARE WHAT TYPE OF BALLS THEY WANT TO PLAY WITH. LET'S PLAY FOOTBALL AND WATCH. BECAUSE THEY'RE FOUR GREAT TEAMS.
AND JUST HAVE KATY PERRY AND LENNY KRAVITZ INFLATE THE FOOTBALLS.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH. THEY'LL BE IN CHARGE OF INFLATING AND DEFLATING FOOTBALLS.
YEAH, THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PERFORM.
Jimmy: WE KNOW PEOPLE AT NBC. BOB COSTAS, EVERYBODY. THAT'S MY MAN. SUPER BOWL COVERAGE STARTS AT NOON EASTERN RIGHT HERE ON NBC. STICK AROUND. MOTLEY CRUE WILL PERFORM NEXT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
