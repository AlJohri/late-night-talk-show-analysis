Questlove: 530! CHICO!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WELCOME, EVERYBODY! WELCOME! WELCOME! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE! THANK YOU FOR WATCHING! WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THIS IS IT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE HERE! WE MADE IT. HI! WELCOME. IT'S A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. LET'S GET TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. GUYS, IT IS FASHION WEEK HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. CAN YOU FEEL THE ENERGY? CAN YOU FEEL THE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EXCITEMENT? IT IS FASHION WEEK, AND I SAW THAT DURING ONE INTERVIEW, KENDALL JENNER MADE THE COMMENT THAT HILLARY CLINTON MIGHT LOOK GOOD IN A JUMPSUIT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND HILLARY SAID, "WELL, HOPEFULLY THEY NEVER FIND THOSE E-MAILS, OR IT'S GOING TO BE AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY!
Jimmy: LIGHTS OUT! LIGHTS OUT! ACTUALLY, YESTERDAY HILLARY SAID THAT THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF HER CAMPAIGN IS FRUSTRATING, AND THAT DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS BEING TREATED MORE FAVORABLY THAN HERS. THEN CNN SAID, "SHH, TRUMP'S ABOUT TO TWEET SOMETHING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?" GET THIS NOW. NOW THERE'S A CONSPIRACY THEORY MAKING THE ROUNDS ONLINE THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS BEING FED ANSWERS THROUGH AN EARPIECE DURING HER TOWN HALL LAST WEEK. SHE HAD A SECRET EARPIECE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HILLARY SAID, "I PROMISE YOU IT WASN'T AN EARPIECE OR MY NAME ISN'T -- HILLARY -- HILLARY -- [ LAUGHTER ] CLINTON. HILLARY CLINTON." LIGHTS OUT! MEANWHILE, TRUMP WAS UNDER FIRE THIS WEEK FOR SAYING HE WAS AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR, EVEN THOUGH HE SEEMED TO SAY THE EXACT OPPOSITE A DECADE AGO. A REPORTER TRIED TO CONFRONT HIM ABOUT IT YESTERDAY, AND I DON'T THINK HE GOT THE ANSWER HE WAS HOPING FOR. CHECK THIS VIDEO OUT.
DAYS AFTER THE INVASION ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN 2 2003 -- MARCH OF 2003, YOU SAID THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS FROM A A MILITARY STANDPOINT? DO YOU STILL STAND BY THOSE COMMENTS?
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT DID THAT MEAN? WHAT DID THAT MEAN, MR. TRUMP?
Jimmy: "YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S FANTASTIC. I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST PREVIEW OF TRUMP AT THE FIRST DEBATE. HE'S LIKE, "YOU ASKED THE QUESTION. YOU ANSWER IT." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU ASK ALL THESE QUESTIONS. YOU SHOULD KNOW THE ANSWER. YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANT." THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FANTASTIC. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF FASHION WEEK. OF COURSE, FASHION WEEK ALWAYS BRINGS TONS OF GLAMOROUS MODELS AND DESIGNERS TO THE CITY WITH ALL THE LATEST FASHIONS. BUT WE THOUGHT IT'D BE FUN TO SEND OUR WRITER, JOSH, OUT INTO THE STREETS TO TALK TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ALWAYS KNOWN FOR HAVING GREAT FASHION -- DADS. [ LAUGHTER ] ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR OUTFITS, IN A SEGMENT WE CALL "FASHION WEEK: DAD EDITION." TAKE A LOOK. ♪ FASHION WEEK DAD EDITION YEAH ♪
WE'RE HERE FOR FASHION WEEK. YOU KNOW IT'S FASHION WEEK. I KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU CAME OUT TODAY. SO, EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU'RE WEARING AND WHY.

SO, EXPLAIN TO ME, WHEN YOU LOOK AT FASHION, WHO ARE YOUR ICONS? WHO DO YOU LOOK UP TO?
OH, THAT'S A HARD ONE -- TO MY WIFE. WHAT SHE TELLS ME I LIKE, THAT'S WHAT I LIKE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WHEN YOU GOT DRESSED THIS MORNING, WERE YOU THINKING IN YOUR HEAD, "THIS IS THE SEXIEST DAVID THAT'S COMING OUT TODAY, THIS IS THE DAVID THAT I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE?"
UH, NO. I DON'T THINK THAT ENTERED MY MIND. [ LAUGHTER ]
SO, EXPLAIN THE SOCKS TO ME, THE HEIGHT OF THE SOCKS SPECIFICALLY.
THE HEIGHT, BASICALLY, IS JUST THAT THEY'RE GYM SOCKS. [ LAUGHTER ]
SO, YOU FEEL THE LENGTH OF THE, OF THE SOCKS MATCHES THE LENGTH OF THE SHORTS, LIKE THEY'RE REACHING FOR EACH OTHER? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
ABSOLUTELY.
ARE THOSE BOTH WATCHES SOMEHOW?
ONE WATCH, AND THIS IS HOW FAR I WALKED TODAY, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I GOT TO KEEP IN SHAPE.

[ LAUGHTER ] AND WEIRDLY, THAT WAS THE MOMENT DUDES WERE LIKE, "I COULD NEVER MAKE IT IN THE NFL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I JUST HATE FLOSSING. CAN'T DO IT." SOME BIG INTERNATIONAL NEWS, GUYS. THIS MORNING, NORTH KOREA CLAIMED IT SUCCESSFULLY TESTED ITS FIFTH AND MOST POWERFUL NUCLEAR WARHEAD. KIM JONG-UN CALLED THE TEST A A "MAJOR TRIUMPH," THEN ASKED HOW LONG IT TAKES EYEBROWS TO GROW BACK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I WAS JUST A LITTLE CLOSE." TRIED IT OUT. VLADIMIR PUTIN TOLD BLOOMBERG'S "BUSINESS WEEK" THAT RUSSIA NEVER INTERFERED WITH A U.S. ELECTION AND DOESN'T PLAN TO. HE SAID, "TRUST ME, IT WAS HARD ENOUGH RIGGING 'THE BACHELORETTE'." I MEAN THAT WAS" -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU THINK CHAD WAS -- CHAD WAS AN ACCIDENT? OH, NO." FINALLY, I WANT TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO OUR PAL, ADAM SANDLER, WHO TURNS 50 YEARS OLD TODAY!

WELL YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE YOU SHOULD TRY TO GET TICKETS TO JIMMY FALLON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO --
Jimmy: REALLY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHE SAID THAT?
AND I TOLD HER YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. I'M GOING TO TRY MAKE, SEE IF I CAN GET IN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, I LOVE HER.
IF YOU'RE WATCHING, I MADE IT. I'M IN.
Jimmy: HEY, YOU GOT IN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S FANTASTIC. AH, WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THIS AND I'M SURE YOU, YOU KNOW, PRODUCING IT ALL AND YOU PROBABLY DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR OWN RECORDS. BUT DOING ALL THIS, IT'S 1998 THROUGH 2016. DOES EVERY SONG GO, YEAH, I REMEMBER WHERE I WAS. I REMEMBER WHERE I WAS WHEN I DID THAT. I MEAN TIMES HAVE CHANGED. YOU'VE GOTTEN MORE POPULAR. HAS YOUR GUITAR CHANGED? HAVE YOU GONE FROM A CHEAP GUITAR TO A VERY EXPENSIVE ACOUSTIC GUITAR? LIKE WHAT DO YOU PLAY NOW AND THEN WHAT DID YOU USE TO PLAY?
THIS GUITAR HERE, I'LL PLAY IT TONIGHT BUT REALLY A A BEAUTIFUL THING I PICKED UP. IT'S FROM THE ARMY/NAVY SPECIAL. THEY MADE IN WORLD WAR I FOR SOLDIERS THEY HAVE ON ARMY BASES AND IN TRENCHES. BUT BY TIME THEY FINISHED MAKING THE GUITAR, THE WAR WAS OVER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S A BUMMER.
AMERICAN INGENUITY.
Jimmy: YEAH, WE'RE CHANGING THE NAME TO THE TELEVISION GUITAR OR WHATEVER THEY WERE INVENTING AT THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT IT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.
Jimmy: I PLAY -- WHEN I PLAY, WHEN I COME UP WITH THE COMEDY SONGS WHICH ARE GREAT SONGS. LIKE, THESE ARE GREAT SONGS BUT I HAVE A FENDER NEWPORTER, YOU EVER HEARD OF THOSE?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE -- IT'S AN ACOUSTIC BUT THE NECK IS ELECTRIC.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE A THIN -- AND IT'S JUST SO EASY AND FUN TO PLAY.
IT'S A BEGINNER'S GUITAR FOR CHILDREN. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY! HERE HE IS. JACK WHITE. HE KNOWS HOW TO DO IT.
I TRIED TO HOLD BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] I REALLY LIKE YOUR SONG WRITING AND I ALWAYS HAVE. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, I'M NOT KIDDING YOU.
Jimmy: MY SONGWRITING. YEAH. THANK YOU. SAY YOU GET AN IDEA FOR A SONG IN YOUR HEAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. DO YOU GET UP AND RECORD IT ON YOUR iPHONE DO YOU HAVE A A A SOUND BOOTH IN YOUR BEDROOM? DON'T GET TOO SPECIFIC BUT YEAH. IT'S A DIFFERENT ALBUM ALL TOGETHER.
I'VE DONE THAT ONLY A COUPLE TIMES BUT I PLAY IT, I'LL GET UP AND TRY TO PLAY IT ON THE GUITAR OR PIANO NEARBY. SO I'M NOT TOO GROGGY TO DO THAT. BUT IF I DON'T REMEMBER IT LATER ON AFTER BREAKFAST, THEN, IT'S NOT WORTH REMEMBERING I THINK.
Jimmy: REALLY? SO THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME JACK WHITE SONGS YOU GO
THERE'S TONS THAT JUST DISAPPEARED.
Jimmy: MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING.
I THINK IF THEY WERE GOOD THEY WOULD HAVE STUCK AROUND IN MY HEAD.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR TONIGHT? DO YOU KNOW?
I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST, JUST HERE TO TALK. I DIDN'T -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: COME ON! YOU'RE DOING "YOU'VE GOT HER IN YOUR POCKET."
I WANT TO PLAY WITH THE ROOTS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO.
Jimmy: NO, NO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STEWART LINDSEY THEY'RE ALREADY DOING IT RIGHT. THEY'RE PLAYING WITH THE ROOTS. THAT'S NEXT TIME YOU CAN PLAY WITH THE ROOTS. TONIGHT IS ACOUSTIC. YOU'RE DOING "LOVE IS THE TRUTH," WHICH IS A SONG -- I DON'T KNOW THAT SONG.
IT WAS WRITTEN WITH A PIECE OF A JAPANESE ARTIST, NODY NODA DID. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE THEY PUT TOGETHER AND IT WAS WITH COCA-COLA, AND THEY ASKED ME TO WRITE MUSIC TO THE PIECE THAT SHE HAD MADE, AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SORT OF A MOMENT THAT COULD REACH MAYBE A HUGE AUDIENCE ACROSS THE WORLD, BUT COCA-COLA ENDED UP NOT LIKING THE COMMERCIAL AND ONLY PLAYED IT ONE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: FANTASTIC.
I REALLY LIKED WRITING FOR HER VISUAL THAT SHE DID BUT
Jimmy: WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HEAR IT TONIGHT AND CONGRATS ON THE RECORD AND I JUST LOVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WE ALL LOVE THAT YOU'RE HERE AND THAT YOU'RE DOING OUR SHOW, AND THAT YOU'RE PERFORMING FOR US.
