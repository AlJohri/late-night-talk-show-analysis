[ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY, STILL EBOLA. EVERYONE JUST -- DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK, NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL de BLASIO TRIED TO ASSURE NEW YORKERS THAT THEY WILL NOT GET EBOLA FROM RIDING THE SUBWAY. HE SAYS HE HAS A FOOL PROOF PLAN FOR DRIVING GERMS OFF THE SUBWAY, MARIACHI BANDS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST MORE AND MORE MARIACHI BANDS. "YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T WANNA TAKE IT. I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS." HE SAYS, MAYOR de BLASIO SAID, "NEW YORKERS WILL NOT GET EBOLA FROM RIDING THE SUBWAY."

THERE'S A LOT TO CHOOSE FROM. PLEASE. EBOLA IS WAY DOWN ON THE LIST." BUT THERE'S A LOT OF FINGER POINTING GOING ON AND HOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS HANDLED THE EBOLA CRISIS. JUST LAST WEEK, CONGRESSMAN DARRELL ISSA CRITICIZED THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH IN FIGHTING THE DISEASE. YEP. HE MENTIONED EBOLA SEVERAL TIMES OR AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. TAKE A LOOK.

[ APPLAUSE ] WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?" SAW THAT LeBRON JAMES. HE SIGNED A DEAL TO BE THE NEW FACE OF THE KIA K-900 CAR SERIES. THAT'S RIGHT. MAINLY BECAUSE WHEN LeBRON DRIVES A KIA, HIS FACE IS THE ONLY THING YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE HANGING OUT OF A TINY KIA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ONE SNEAKER WILL FIT IN A KIA. HE DRIVES TWO KIAS.
Steve: LIKE PAUL BUNYAN.

Jimmy: I'M NOT SURE. I DON'T KNOW, NOW, LOOK, I HEARD THIS ONE STORY ABOUT YOU. TELL ME IF THIS IS TRUE. WHEN YOU WERE -- YOU WERE ABOUT TO BE PICKED UP BY PHILADELPHIA, 76ers -- [ CHEERS ] AND YOU GAINED -- YOU WANTED TO GET FAT SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T PICK YOU.
YEAH. SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS THEY BROUGHT ME IN A MONTH IN ADVANCE AND I WEIGHED 292. AND THE OWNER SAYS, "PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT." THEY SAID, "WE WANT TO BRING YOU BACK A DAY BEFORE THE DRAFT, WE WANT YOU DOWN TO 285." SO I WENT TO TEXAS FOR THE SUMMER, GOT IN SHAPE. I WAS ACTUALLY DOWN PROBABLY ABOUT 280, AND THEN MY AGENT SAID, "YOU KNOW, IF THE 76ers DRAFT YOU, THEY HAD A HARD SALARY CAP BACK THEN, YOU CAN ONLY GET A ONE YEAR DEAL FOR $75,000." I SAID, I DIDN'T LEAVE COLLEGE EARLY FOR $75,000. SO WE HAD 48 HOURS BEFORE WE HAD TO GO BACK TO PHILADELPHIA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU WANTED TO GET FAT IN 48 HOURS?
SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS WE WENT TO DENNY'S. [ LAUGHTER ] NO SERIOUSLY, WE WENT TO DENNY'S, I ATE TWO GRAND SLAM BREAKFASTS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE WENT TO LUNCH AT RED LOBSTER. I GOT EVERY HUSH PUPPIE THAT WASN'T NAILED DOWN. THEN WE WENT OUT TO DINNER THAT NIGHT. I GOT LIKE TWO T-BONE STEAKS AND I GOT UP THE NEXT DAY AND DID THE EXACT SAME THING. SO I FLY TO PHILADELPHIA, I GET ON THE SCALE. I WEIGH 302. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT?
AND I SAID -- AND THE GUY CURSES ME UP AND DOWN. AND I'M KIND OF LAUGHING INSIDE. I SAID, "WELL THEN YOU WON'T DRAFT ME, RIGHT?" SO THEN I GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, JIMMY, I AIN'T LYING. THEY SAID, "WITH THE NUMBER FIVE PICK --" I'M LIKE, "OH GOD, THANK GOD PHILLY'S NOT GONNA DRAFT ME. "WITH THE NUMBER FIVE PICK, THE PHILADELPHIA 76ers SELECT CHARLES BARKLEY." I WAS LIKE, "OH, HELL NO." HELL NO.
Jimmy: NOT ONLY AM I ON THE TEAM, BUT NOW I'M --
I'M FAT AND POOR. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S DEADLY COMBINATION.
Jimmy: WHY'D YOU DO THAT TO YOURSELF. YEAH EXACTLY.
I SAID, I LEFT COLLEGE --
Jimmy: WHAT DID YOU DO MAN?
I WAS ALREADY POOR MY WHOLE LIFE. I LEFT COLLEGE TO GET RICH, NOW I'M POOR AND FAT.
Jimmy: BUT THEN YOU BECAME YOU -- I MEAN THEN YOU BECAME YOU -- YOU'RE ONE OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS OF ALL TIME. WE LOVE YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] SO "INSIDE THE NBA" STARTS TOMORROW NIGHT.
