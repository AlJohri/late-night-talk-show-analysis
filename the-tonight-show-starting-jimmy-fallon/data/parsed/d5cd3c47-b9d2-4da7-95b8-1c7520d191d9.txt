BUT THE DOG FEELS LIKE SHE'S LIKE, "SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT OUT OF THIS RELATIONSHIP." I GO, "THIS IS FUN." DO YOU HAVE A DOG?
YEAH. I HAVE A LAB I NAMED ELLEN. SHE'S LIKE -- THE LAST TIME I TOOK HER TO HER CHECKUP THE DOCTOR WAS LIKE SHE'S LITERALLY TEN TIMES HEAVIER SINCE I HAD JULIAN AND IT'S BECAUSE JULIAN'S BEEN FEEDING HER SO MUCH FOOD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE BROUGHT A CLIP --
Jimmy: WE BROUGHT A CLIP OF WHAT'S GOING ON. WHY'S THE DOG GETTING -- [ DOG BARK ] YEAH, THERE YOU GO. THE DOG'S JUST EATING UP THE SCRAPS. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT DOES THE BABY EAT?
BASICALLY KALE, HUMMUS, GUACAMOLE.
Jimmy: WHAT?
BLACK BEANS. WE'RE BRAZILIAN. WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE HIM SUPER --
Jimmy: SUPER HEALTHY. I GIVE THEM LIKE SNICKERS BARS AND PRINGLES. [ LAUGHTER ] LOVES PRINGLES, YEAH. YOU BROUGHT ME A FUN GIFT.
SO EASTER IS REALLY HUGE IN BRAZILIAN HOUSEHOLDS. FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE CARNAVAL, WHICH IS HUGE. THEN EASTER. WE HAVE THESE -- I'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT IN AMERICA. WE HAVE THESE GIANT EGGS. IT'S JUST THE WAY WE DO IT.
Jimmy: I'VE NEVER SEEN THESE, YOU BROUGHT ME ONE --
I BROUGHT YOU TWO. ONE'S FOR YOU, TO TAKE HOME.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GIANT EGG, THAT'S A GIANT CADBURY --
THEY'RE SO YUMMY.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE THEY?
THEN IN THE MIDDLE THEY USUALLY HAVE THESE TREATS, SOMETIMES IT'S TOYS, SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFERENT CHOCOLATES. SO I BROUGHT YOU A SECOND ONE YOU CAN OPEN UP. HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT A CADBURY BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE MESSY.
Jimmy: THIS ONE OVER HERE. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] OH, WHAT'S IN IT? MORE CHOCOLATE.
MORE CHOCOLATE.
Jimmy: WHAT A WEIRD THING TO PUT INSIDE CHOCOLATE.
THAT YELLOW ONE.
Jimmy: I NEVER SAW THAT ONE COMING AT ALL.
REALLY JUST GO FOR IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S JUST, THIS IS GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH, HAPPY EASTER.
STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHOCOLATES.
Jimmy: OH REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: I WANT TO DO THIS, WHY DON'T WE DO THIS IN AMERICA? WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT "FURIOUS 7." CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THE BIGGEST THING IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOVIES EVER. THIS WAS THE WORST THING I COULD HAVE -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S DELICIOUS.
IT'S SO SWEET.
Jimmy: I KNOW, BUT -- DON'T EAT, OKAY, WELL -- [ LAUGHTER ] TOO LATE. TOO LATE. SPIT IT OUT. NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. WHERE'S YOUR DOG? NOT FOR DOGS. NO. SORRY. DON'T DO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M SPITTING CHOCOLATES. THIS IS A DISASTER. TELL ME ABOUT -- THE NEW ONE IS INSANE. I KNOW YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK. I'LL TALK FOR YOU.

NO.
Jimmy: THEY WANT YOU TO -- HOW FURIOUS DO YOU GET THIS TIME?
100%.
Jimmy: 100% FURIOUS. FAST IS A GIVEN. SO FURIOUS 7, THIS TIME CARS ARE BEING DROPPED FROM PLANES. THEY'RE DRIVING THROUGH BUILDINGS.
THROUGH BUILDINGS.
Jimmy: IT'S THE MOST INSANE ONE YET, I THINK.
IT REALLY IS.
Jimmy: FANTASTIC. IT'S THE BIGGEST THING. AND HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE. IT'S FRIDAY. BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST OPENINGS IN THE HISTORY OF UNIVERSAL.
