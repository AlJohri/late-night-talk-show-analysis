AND IF YOU'VE WATCHED ALL FOUR, YOU DO KNOW WHAT NETFLIX IS, RIGHT? I MEAN, YOU COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE. THAT'S RIGHT, TONIGHT WAS THE FOURTH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. AND BEFORE THE DEBATE, MODERATOR NEIL CAVUTO COMPARED THE LAST DEBATE TO ACCESS HOLLYWOOD. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FAIR COMPARISON, BECAUSE EVEN ACCESS HOLLYWOOD HAS A BUSH WHO WANTS TO BE THERE. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, I MEAN, MY MAN, BILLY. BILLY BUSH, MY MAN.
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, BEN CARSON RECENTLY WENT ON FACEBOOK TO OFFER PROOF THAT THE EVENTS HE TALKED ABOUT IN HIS LIFE REALLY HAPPENED.

Steve: COME ON, POVERBS.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S A BUMMER. YUP, POVERBS. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT HIS STRATEGY TO FIGHT ISIS IS TO TAKE OIL AWAY FROM THE REGION. ACTUALLY, HIS EXACT QUOTE WAS, "I'M LOOKING TO TAKE THE OIL. I WANT TO TAKE THE OIL. I WANT THE OIL." [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, THAT'S THE QUOTE. THAT ACTUALLY WAS ONLY PART OF WHAT HE SAID. HERE'S THE ENTIRE QUOTE. "I'M LOOKING TO TAKE THE OIL, I WANT THE OIL, THE OIL IS WHAT I WANT TO TAKE. [ LAUGHTER ] ME WANT TAKE OIL, OILY OILY TAKE TAKE. HERR OILER VON LOOKENTAKE." WHICH IS? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GERMAN?
Steve: GERMAN? TRUMP!
Jimmy: I GET THE POINT, YEAH. AND DID YOU SEE THIS YESTERDAY? DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT HE'S THINKING ABOUT BOYCOTTING STARBUCKS BECAUSE MERRY CHRISTMAS ISN'T PRINTED ON THE RED HOLIDAY CUP. TRUMP WAS LIKE, "EVERYTHING SHOULD HAVE ONE OF TWO THINGS WRITTEN ON IT, MERRY CHRISTMAS OR MY NAME." [ APPLAUSE ] AND THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH. I AGREE WITH HIM. EVEN THOUGH, A LOCAL FOX REPORTER ALSO GOT IN ON THE STARBUCKS DEBATE AND WOUND UP HAVING HIS OWN PROBLEMS WITH ONE OF THEIR CUPS. WATCH THIS.

SEE IF IT WANTS TO HAVE A A LITTLE NIBBLE. THESE ANIMALS ARE RODENTS. THEY'RE CLOSELY RELATED TO RATS AND MICE.
Jimmy: YEAH, THEY'RE LIKE GIANT RATS.
LOOK WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TOTHEMSELVES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DOES THAT HURT, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
I MEAN.
Jimmy: OR ARE YOU OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ]
THE THING IS, YOU SEE, DO YOU MIND GIVING HIM THAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, HE'S GONNA CHOMP DOWN ON THAT.
THEY'VE HIGHLY MODIFIED THEIR HAIRS INTO A REALLY EFFICIENT MEANS OF DEFENSE. THEY HAVE 30,000 VERY SHARP BARBED SPINES. SO, IF THEY'RE CONFRONTED BY A A PREDATOR AND IN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE A HYENA, A A LEOPARD, OR A LION, THEY CAN'T SHOOT THEM OUT. THAT'S A MISCONCEPTION. THEY CAN'T FIRE THEM.
Jimmy: OKAY, THEY CAN'T FIRE THEIR HAIRS. NO.
NO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEIR SPINES, THEIR SPINES.
Jimmy: THEIR SPINES, SORRY.
BUT THEY WILL PUSH THEM INTO YOU. SO IF SHE GETS A BIT UPSET, THEN I'VE GOT A BIG PROBLEM TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, OKAY, YEAH.
QUICK, GIVE US SOME MORE FOOD.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO GET HER UPSET. NO, NO. GO AHEAD AND GIVE THE -- YEAH. OH, MY GOSH. THAT IS A GIANT RAT. IT'S REALLY UNBELIEVABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVE THE SPINES TOO. IT'S KINDA SLICKED BACK ALMOST LIKE ELVIS.
NO, IT'S NOT. THE THING IS, IT'S DOWN LIKE TRUMP NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING OF. LOOKS LIKE DONALD TRUMP.
IT'S DOWN LIKE TRUMP. IF IT GOES TO ELVIS QUIFF, THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT UPSET.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE UPSET.
BUT THEY'RE FABULOUS ANIMALS CAN YOU SMELL HER? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU. I HAVEN'T, NO. I WAS JUST LIKE OH, YOU'RE WEARING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS MUSTN'T BE MISSED. THIS COULD BE THE ONLY TIME YOU GET A CHANCE TO SNIFF AN AFRICAN CRESTED PORCUPINE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GO ON, HAVE IT.
Jimmy: OKAY, I'M DOING IT.
GO ON. AWE, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SMELL THE EAR.
Jimmy: IT'S FANTASTIC. NO, NO, YOU'RE WEIRD NOW. NOW YOU'RE GETTING WEIRD. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW YOU'RE GETTER WEIRD. WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE. SMELL THE EAR.
OKAY. LET'S SWAP.
Jimmy: WOW, WOW, WOW. OKAY.
SWAP THE HAND GRENADE.
Jimmy: CAREFUL.
SO, THIS BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL HERE.
Jimmy: WOW. [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
NOW THIS IS A REAL BEAUTY. THIS IS THE SECOND LARGEST -- I THINK IT CAN SMELL PORCUPINE. THIS IS THE SECOND LARGEST LIZARD IN THE WORLD. IT'S AN ASIAN WATER MONITOR. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY GET UP TO ABOUT 40 POUNDS.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. LOOK AT THAT TONGUE.
AND A COUPLE OF METERS LONG. AND THEY'VE GOT THIS EXTRAORDINARY TONGUE WHICH THEY USE FOR FINDING THEIR PREY. NOW IN THE WILD, FAIRLY SMALL BIRDS, SMALL MAMMALS, REPTILES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S JUST STOPPING AND STARING RIGHT AT ME. THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING, LIKE, I DON'T COME OFF AS A PREDATOR, DO I? NO.
DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY HAVE A A FORKED TONGUE, SNAKES AND LIZARDS?
Jimmy: NO, I DON'T.
WELL, IT'S SO THEY CAN TASTE THE DIRECTION THAT THE SMELL IS COMING FROM. WHEN THEY STICK IT OUT AND IT WHAFS AROUND. IF THERE'S MORE SCENT COMING FROM THIS DIRECTION, THEN IT KNOWS THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT THE SMELL IS COMING FROM. SO THAT'S WHY SNAKES AND LIZARDS HAVE THESE SORT OF FORKED TONGUES. WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THESE ANIMALS RECENTLY IS ALTHOUGH WE HAVE 5,000 DIFFERENT SPECIES OF LIZARD AND WE THOUGHT ONLY TWO OF THEM WERE VENOMOUS, THE GILA MONSTER AND THE BEADED LIZARD HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO, WE NOW KNOW THAT 500 SPECIES ARE VENOMOUS, INCLUDING THIS ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THIS IS --
Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
I WON'T ASK YOU TO SMELL -- [ LAUGHTER ] I WON'T ASK YOU TO SMELL THE MONITOR.
Jimmy: NO, I DON'T WANT TO SMELL THIS MONITOR, THANK YOU.
BUT I HAVE TO YOU THAT TTHE VENOM IS ONLY THERE TO HELP DIGEST THE PREY.
Jimmy: OH, OF COURSE, YEAH.
NOT TO KILL IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I'M GONNA TOSS THE MONITOR ACROSS HERE.
Jimmy: EITHER WAY, I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT VENOMOUS ANIMAL HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
HOLD ON. SHE'S GOT ME IN THE, IN AN IMPORTANT AREA. NOW I'M GOING TO GET ON THE GROUND, JIMMY. IF YOU WANT TO COME AROUND HERE FOR THE NEXT ANIMAL.
Jimmy: OKAY.
BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING VERY, VERY SPECIAL INDEED. THESE ARE A PAIR OF SPOTTED HYENA. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
COME ON, COME ON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ARE YOU GONNA, ARE WE GONNA FIGHT EACH OTHER? WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?
NO, THEY'RE COOL. THIS IS A YOUNG MALE, ABOUT THREE MONTHS OLD. HE'S QUITE FRISKY. THIS IS A FEMALE, ABOUT SIX MONTHS OLD.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL.
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. NOW THEY LOOK LIKE A DOG. IN FACT THEY'RE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO CATS OR EVEN CLOSER TO MONGOOSE. AND OF COURSE THEY HAVE A A TERRIBLE REPUTATION. THEY HAVE A REPUTATION FOR BEING A HORRIBLE SCAVENGING ANIMAL, BUT 95% OF THE THINGS THAT THEY EAT, THEY ACTUALLY KILL FOR THEMSELVES. THEY'RE HIGHLY SOCIAL. THEY LIVE IN GROUPS OF UP TO ABOUT 90 INDIVIDUALS. AND I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET HER BECAUSE YOU SMELLED THE PORCUPINE. NOW IT'S THE HYENA. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IF YOU GO RIGHT DOWN, JIMMY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
COME ON, TRUST ME. WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR FIVE MINUTES, COME ON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. I NOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. I'M GOING TO END UP SPOONING WITH YOU. AND IT'S JUST GONNA GO DIFFERENT WAY.
TIP YOUR HEAD DOWN. TIP YOUR HEAD DOWN IN A A SUBMISSIVE FASHION. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'LL SEE IF SHE -- [ APPLAUSE ] SHE MAY WANT TO COME OVER. BUT THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL ANIMAL. TO SEE ONE LIKE THIS, AND LOOK NOW, CHILLING OUT ON YOUR CARPET.
Jimmy: I MEAN, THAT'S THE COOLEST THING EVER. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
I'M POINTS OUT OF TEN, JIMMY?
Jimmy: TEN.
TEN.
Jimmy: YEAH, TEN OUT OF TEN.
GOOD MAN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: QUILLS.
LOOK AT THE EARS. AND THEY'RE REALLY INTELLIGENT, TOO.
Jimmy: HAVE YOU SMELLED THE EARS? [ LAUGHTER ]
I HAVEN'T SMELLED THEM YET.
Jimmy: NO, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T. DON'T DO IT. DON'T DO IT.
THESE HAVE BEEN TESTED AT DUKE UNIVERSITY. AND THEY WERE FOUND TO BE IN SOME TRIALS MORE INTELLIGENT THAN CHIMPANZEES.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: WELL I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THEM HERE.
SO THIS IS AN ANIMAL WITH A A BAD REPUTATION, WHICH IS REALLY, REALLY BEAUTIFUL. REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
Jimmy: I'M GOING TO CRAWL BACK AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY.
Jimmy: AND THEN, OH, YOU HAVE ONE MORE THING FOR US?
ONE MORE THING. LET'S SWAP OVER TO OUR LAST ANIMAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: THAT IS FANTASTIC.
WOW. WHAT ABOUT THAT?
Jimmy: THESE ARE THE -- I MEAN, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THESE ARE ALL FANTASTIC THINGS. THIS IS WHY I LOVE HAVING THIS JOB. YOU GET TO MEET THESE FUN ANIMALS AND THEY DON'T BITE ME, AND IT'S JUST GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
HAVEN'T BIT ME YET EITHER.
Jimmy: NO, GOOD, I'M HAPPY, YEAH.
ONLY ONE. ONLY ONE. OKAY, LET'S HAVE THE LAST ANIMAL. THIS IS A BLACK VULTURE. IT COMES FROM THE NATIONAL AVIARY IN PITTSBURGH. IT'S A GREAT PLACE. THEY TEACH PEOPLE ABOUT ALL OF THESE BIRDS. AND IT'S GOING TO FLY TO YOU, JIMMY.
Jimmy: IT'S GONNA FLY TO ME?
SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IS COME AROUND THE SIDE, TAKE YOUR PLACE UP IN THE AUDIENCE.
Jimmy: YEAH, LET'S DO IT.
I'LL TELL YOU A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT IT, AND IT'S GOING TO FLY UP THERE. KEEP YOUR NERVE.
Jimmy: OKAY, OH, MY GOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
Jimmy: NICE TO MEET YOU.
SO YOU'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR HAND IN THIS SLOT.
OKAY, NOW.
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND THEN YOUR GONNA HOLD IT OUT TO THE SIDE.
THESE BIRDS ARE REALLY SUCCESSFUL.
AND SHE'S GOING TO LAND ON IT.
THERE'S ABOUT 20 MILLION PAIRS IN THE WORLD. ABOUT 10% OF THE POPULATION IS HERE IN THE U.S. THEY WILL FORAGE IN FAMILIES AND THEY WILL, UNLIKE SOME VULTURES WHICH ARE PURELY SCAVENGERS, ACTUALLY ATTACK AND KILL THEIR OWN PREY.
Jimmy: IT WON'T LAND ON ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE AND ATTACK AND TRY TO KILL SOMEONE. NO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
THE KEY THING JIMMY IS THE LEGS.
Jimmy: EVERYONE STAY STILL.
DO YOU SEE THE WHITE LEGS?
Jimmy: YES, THE WHITE LEGS.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
Jimmy: FEET? [ LAUGHTER ]
TO COOL THEMSELVES DOWN WHEN THEY GET REALLY HOT, T DEFECATE ON THEIR OWN LEG AS IT EVAPORATES IT COOLS THEM DOWN. ANYWAYS, CALL IT OVER. IT WILL LAND ON YOU RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: COME ON OVER, VULTURE. [ LAUGHTER ] COME HERE. COME HERE. HI. [ SCREAMS ]
