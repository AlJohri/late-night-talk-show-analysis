Jimmy: OH, HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME! WELCOME! PLEASE ENJOY YOURSELF. WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. HOT CROWD, HOT NEW YORK CITY CROWD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GOT STYLE, BABY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AT HOME. I APPRECIATE THAT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. LAST NIGHT, THE CHICAGO CUBS WON GAME TWO OF THE WORLD SERIES. [ CHEERS ] THAT'S RIGHT, TO TIE IT UP, 1-1. YEAH, IT'S ALL TIED UP, WHICH ARE THE SCARIEST WORDS AMERICANS CAN HEAR TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION. "I THINK THE ELECTION" -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ TRUMP VOICE ] "I THINK THE ELECTION SHOULD ALSO BE BEST OF SEVEN." [ LAUGHTER ] "RIGGED!" THIS IS CRAZY, THOUGH. I SAW THAT TICKETS TO WORLD SERIES GAMES IN CHICAGO THIS WEEKEND COST OVER $2,000 AND EVEN THE BARS NEAR WRIGLEY FIELD HAVE A $250 COVER CHARGE. CUBS FANS ARE LIKE, "I THINK I LIKED IT BETTER WHEN WE WERE LOSING. CAN'T AFFORD TO GET A BEER!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE LAST TIME THE CHICAGO CUBS WON THE WORLD SERIES WAS 1 1908, AND I READ THAT THE TEAM'S BEST PITCHER THAT YEAR WAS A GUY NAMED MORDECAI "THREE FINGER" BROWN. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S TRUE. HE ONLY HAS THREE FINGERS ON HIS THROWING HAND FROM A FARM MACHINERY ACCIDENT. WELL, WE DUG INTO THE "THE TONIGHT SHOW" BASEBALL CARD COLLECTION AND FOUND SOME OF HIS TEAMMATES FROM 1908.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: IT'S VERY INTERESTING.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: CHECK THESE GUYS OUT. THIRD BASE, THEY HAD CLARENCE "BIG EAR" MONROE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE OUTFIELD, OF COURSE, THEY HAD MANNY "MOOBS" O'NEAL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CATCHER WAS NED "BABY NOSE" ZAMBROWSKI. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, SHORTSTOP, YOU HAD GILLY "PENDULOUS TESTICLE" GORMON. GILLY GORMAN.
Steve: HEY-OH!
Jimmy: THE FAMOUS GILLY GORMON.
Steve: GILLY GORMON. HE COULD CATCH A FOUL BALL.
Jimmy: HE CERTAINLY DID. [ LAUGHTER ] [ RIM SHOT ] SOME ELECTION NEWS HERE. HILLARY CLINTON IS OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING THROUGH THE HOME STRETCH, STILL TRYING TO WIN PEOPLE OVER. IN FACT, YESTERDAY, SHE DID AN INTERVIEW WITH A HIP-HOP RADIO STATION, AND SHE SAID SHE LOVES TO DANCE ANY CHANCE SHE GETS. AND THE DJ WAS LIKE, WELL, THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S ENOUGH. THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MEANWHILE, I READ THAT HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN JUST SENT OUT SAVE THE DATE INVITATIONS FOR HER ELECTION NIGHT CELEBRATION HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK THINGS GOT AWKWARD WHEN BILL ASKED IF HE COULD BRING A A PLUS ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, IT'S COMMON COURTESY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I SAW THAT DONALD TRUMP'S STAR ON THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME WAS DESTROYED BY SOMEONE USING A PICK AX AND A SLEDGE HAMMER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LUCKILY, TRUMP'S HAND PRINTS IN FRONT OF THE CHINESE THEATER HAVE NOT BEEN TOUCHED. WE HAVE A PICTURE. THERE'S HIS HANDPRINTS. THEY'RE FINE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. I DID NOT KNOW THIS. I READ THAT TRUMP'S FIRST TELEVISION APPEARANCE -- ANYONE KNOW? IT WAS ON "THE JEFFERSONS" BACK IN 1981. YEAH. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER IT WAS THE EPISODE WHERE THE JEFFERSONS' APPLICATION FOR A DELUXE APARTMENT IN THE SKY WAS DENIED. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "YOU'RE MOVING ON DOWN. IN MY APARTMENTS, FISH DON'T FRY IN THE KITCHEN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND BEANS DON'T BURN ON THE GRILL. IT TOOK A WHOLE LOT OF TRYING JUST TO GET UP THAT HILL. NOW I'M UP IN THE BIG LEAGUES WITH A SMALL LOAN FROM MY DAD OF A MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE BIG LEAGUES."
Steve: BIGLY. BIG LEAGUES.
Jimmy: BIGLY. GUYS, FINALLY, THIS IS VERY EXCITING. I HEARD THAT KEVIN HART IS IN TALKS TO PLAY SANTA CLAUS IN DISNEY'S UPCOMING CHRISTMAS MOVIE, YEAH, WHICH IS GOING TO GET A LITTLE AWKWARD WHEN HE TELLS AN ELF WHAT TO DO AND THEY'RE LIKE, REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ] REALLY? WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: BUTTERCUP.
BUTTERCUPS.
THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING THAT JUST HAPPENED. HOW ARE YOU, JIMMY?
Jimmy: I'M FANTASTIC. THANK YOU FOR BOTH BEING HERE. AND I APPRECIATE IT.

YOU LOOK SO YOUNG, IT SEEMS LIKE BRAD AND ANGELINA SHOULD BE FIGHTING FOR CUSTODY OVER YOU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, WELL THAT'S NICE. THAT IS SO NICE OF YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMPLIMENTING ME.
STEVE, BY THE WAY, WAS LOOKING AT THE MONITOR. AND YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T THINK HE LOOKED GOOD.
NO, I DID NOT SAY THAT.
YOU DID. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
NO, I SAID HE HAD CHILDBEARING HIPS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'VE HEARD THAT, BY THE WAY.
WELL THAT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: I HAVE HEARD THAT. I TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT.
THIS IS SO EXCITING. THE THREE OF US -- THE THREE OF US HAVEN'T BEEN TOGETHER SINCE WE ROBBED KIM KARDASHIAN. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TOO SOON?
NO, IT'S NOT TOO SOON.
Jimmy: A LITTLE TOO SOON.
IS THAT TOO SOON?
Jimmy: A LITTLE BIT.
I WAS JUST SO EXCITED WHEN YOU CALLED ME TO SEE IF WE WANTED TO DO THE SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT I SAID. I SAID, "JIMMY, I AM WAY TOO HIGH TO DEAL WITH THIS RIGHT NOW." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DO REMEMBER YOU SAYING THAT.
BY THE WAY, BEFORE YOU GET TO YOUR PREPARED TEXT, LET ME ASK YOU -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THERE'S OTHER THINGS I WANT TO GET INTO FIRST.
UH-HUH, SURE.
Jimmy: ONE IS THAT IT HAS BEEN 30 YEARS SINCE YOU GUYS FIRST MET ON "THREE AMIGOS."
THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT IS WHERE YOU MET?
WE DID. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAD NEVER MET.
ALL THOSE YEARS THAT YOU DID "SCTV" AND I WAS DOING "SNL" BUT WE HAD NEVER MET BEFORE.
WE HAD NEVER MET. AND THEN THERE WERE -- WERE WONDERING IF I WAS INTERESTED IN "THREE AMIGOS", WHICH OF COURSE I WAS, IT WAS MY FIRST MOVIE. AND I HAVE THIS KIND OF "RAIN MAN" MEMORY. IT WAS MAY 4th, 1985 -- I WENT TO HIS OLD HOUSE ON BEDFORD DRIVE.
YEAH.
AND I REMEMBER I WALKED IN, AND IT WAS LIKE SO BEAUTIFUL. AND THERE WERE PICASSOS ON THE WALL AND HOPPERS AND I SAID TO HIM, "HOW DID YOU GET THAT RICH?" BECAUSE I'VE SEEN YOUR WORK. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I WAS STRUCK WITH HOW PALE HE WAS IN PERSON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
I'M NOT PALE.
NO, IT WAS LIKE I WAS BEING HAUNTED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU THINK HE'S PALE?
NO, STEVE, YOU'RE WHITER THAN A TRUMP RALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I DON'T THINK I'M PALE. I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I FELT MARTY WAS FUNNY AND I KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT HIM. I WAS ON THE -- IT WAS THE FIRST DAY OF SHOOTING ON THE "THREE AMIGOS" AND I WAS WALKING TO THE SET. YOU KNOW, THE FULL OUTFIT. AND FROM BEHIND ME, I HEARD KATHARINE HEPBURN SAY, "WHERE'S MY BICYCLE?" YOU DO IT BETTER. DO WHAT YOU DID. [ KATHARINE HEPBURN VOICE ]
WHERE THE HELL -- I WISH I HAD MY BICYCLE, WE COULD GO AND PICK BLUEBERRIES. IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND I WALKED BY -- I TURNED AND I THOUGHT, "OH, I GOT THREE MONTHS TO GO WITH THIS GUY." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND YOU JUST HIT IT OFF FROM DAY ONE.
IT WAS GREAT. IT REALLY WAS. IT WAS PERFECT.
Jimmy: DID YOU COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER? DO YOU LIKE HIS COMEDY SKILLS? DO YOU SEE HIM AS A --
YEAH, YOU SAID YOU HAD SEEN "THE JERK" 500 TIMES
OH, I HAVE SEEN -- YEAH, I REALLY HAVE. I'VE SEEN "THE JERK" 500 TIMES AT LEAST. AND EVERY TIME I SEE IT, I SAY THE SAME THING. I ALWAYS SAY, "STEVE, WE COULD WATCH SOMETHING ELSE, YOU KNOW." [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE -- SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU. ASK YOUR QUESTION AND THEN I'LL IGNORE IT. GO AHEAD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW ARE YOU? WHEN DID YOU FIRST MEET? NO, THIS IS --
THAT'S GREAT. I LOVE THAT QUESTION. BY THE WAY, GREAT QUESTION.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. IT JUST CAME FROM THE TOP OF MY HEAD.
WHEN I'M ON THE ROAD WITH MARTY, THERE'S SOMETHING I LIKE TO DO. WE'RE TRAVELING TO MANY, MANY DIFFERENT CITIES. AND BY THE WAY, IT'S A LITTLE DESPERATE, IT'S OCTOBER AND THE FIRST SHOW'S IN FEBRUARY. WE'RE PROMOTING IT ALREADY. WE'RE THAT SCARED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I -- DURING THE DAY IN THESE TOWNS, THESE WONDERFUL TOWNS. I LIKE TO GO TO THE ART MUSEUM, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S THE ONE PLACE THAT I WON'T RUN INTO MARTY.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S PERFECT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS SO NICE.
IT IS -- IT IS -- I MEAN, WE'RE VERY CLOSE FRIENDS. WE'VE BEEN -- I'M VERY, VERY CLOSE. WE'RE CLOSER THAN PUTIN AND TRUMP. WE ARE REALLY VERY CLOSE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE LIKE DONNY AND MARIE WITHOUT THE SEXUAL TENSION. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE LIKE ELLEN DeGENERES AND A VEST. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WE'RE CLOSE.
Jimmy: VERY CLOSE. YES, SURE. OF COURSE.
AND FOR ME, IT'S FUN TO BE ON STAGE
ELLEN DeGENERES AND A VEST.
Jimmy: AND A VEST, YEAH.
FOR ME, IT'S FUN TO BE ON STAGE WITH A POTENTIAL ORGAN DONOR. IT MAKES YOU FEEL SAFE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE TITLE IS "AN EVENING YOU'LL FORGET FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE."
YES.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I JUST LOVE THAT. IS THAT THE FIRST ONE YOU GUYS THOUGH OF?
NO, NO. WE HAD MANY OPTIONS FOR TITLES. THE PRODUCER WANTED TO CALL IT "ANTIQUES ROADSHOW." [ LAUGHTER ]
I WANTED TO CALL IT "STROKE US LADY FAME." YEAH.
I HAD ONE. "SEE THEM BEFORE THEY'RE DEAD." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S CHARMING.
AND THE ONE I LIKED, BUT WAS TOO LONG FOR THE MARQUEE WAS, "YOU GOT IT IN THERE, NOW GET IT OUT." [ LAUGHTER ] IT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT.
IT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: JUST SEEMS A LITTLE LONG.
IT JUST SEEMS LONG.
Jimmy: A LITTLE LONG. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S THINGS WE'VE GOT TO DISCUSS. A 50-CITY TOUR. THAT'S GIGANTIC. I WANT TO GO SEE YOU GUYS. AND IT'S YOU GUYS TALKING --

Jimmy: YES. THERE'S MUSIC, THERE'S COMEDY, THERE'S BANTER, THERE'S CLIPS.
SO IT'S LIKE A BREAKTHROUGH SHOW.
Jimmy: IT REALLY IS.
IT IS AS LOOSE AS I'VE EVER FELT ON STAGE. I THINK THAT WE HAD SO MUCH --
WE CAN FIX THAT WITH MEDICINE. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, BUT IT REALLY IS.
HEY, IF I SAY SOMETHING FUNNY, WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME AMAZED? [ LAUGHTER ]
IT REALLY -- IT'S SHOCK. IT'S SHOCK. NO, BUT I -- IT'S AS MUCH FUN AS YOU CAN HAVE, AND WE'RE JUST HAVING THE BEST TIME.

WE JUST FOUND OUT IT IS THE ENVELOPE.
Jimmy: THESE ARE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO US IN REAL LIFE, AND THE OTHER IS IN THE ENVELOPE, IT'S A LIE. SO THERE'S A LIE AND A TRUTH. ONCE YOU READ THE CONFESSION, EITHER WAY IT'S THE SAME, THE TWO OTHER PLAYERS HAVE 60 SECONDS TO INTERROGATE YOU AND THEY EACH HAVE TO GUESS WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN LYING OR TELLING THE TRUTH.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. STEVE, YOU GO FIRST. MARTIN, WHICH ENVELOPE SHOULD STEVE OPEN?
LET ME SHUFFLE THEM FIRST.
WELL, SINCE THEY'RE NUMBERED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY ARE NUMBERED, YEAH.
I WOULD SAY TOP.
WHICH ONE? THIS ONE.
THAT ONE.
OKAY.
Jimmy: THE ONE HE WANTED.
ALL RIGHT.
I SLEPT WITH BRIGITTE BARDOT.
Jimmy: AROUND WHAT TIME DID THIS HAPPEN?
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN 1968.
WHERE WAS THIS ABOUT?
I'LL FILL IN A FEW DETAILS. I WAS A WRITER ON THE "SMOTHERS BROTHERS SHOW," I WAS 23, AND WE WON AN EMMY. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FOR?
I JUST REMEMBERED THAT FAMOUS BRIGITTE BARDOT APPEARANCE IN THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS.
NO, SHE WASN'T ON THE SMOTHERS.
Jimmy: OKAY, GO AHEAD.
AND WE WON AN EMMY. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] [ LAUGHTER ]
SHE'S ON STEVE MARTIN.
SO, THREE WRITERS AND I WENT DOWN TO CABO SAN LUCAS, AT A A HOTEL. AND -- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FOR? I DON'T TELL YOU EVERYTHING.
I KNOW. BUT NO. AFTER A 50-CITY TOUR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD ME THIS. GO HEAD.
I GOT TO MOVE IT ALONG. I WAS WALKING DOWN THE BEACH AND THERE WAS AN EMPTY PART OF THE BEACH AND THERE WAS ONE OF THOSE GNARLY TREES. AND THERE WAS A WOMAN LYING THERE AND I -- [ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE FUN OF ME.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT A ROAST. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NO BIG SLEUTH. I'M GOING TO SAY THAT'S A LIE.
Jimmy: I THINK IT'S A LIE AS WELL. STEVE?
WELL, I DID. HOW'S THAT? NO, I DIDN'T. NO, I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T. BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE.
Jimmy: THERE ARE NO LOSERS.
THERE ARE THREE OF THEM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. MY TURN. WHICH ENVELOPE SHOULD I OPEN, ONE OR TWO? YOU GO. I PICKED LAST.
OKAY. NUMBER TWO.
Jimmy: OKAY. I ONCE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH REGIS PHILBIN ON THE WAY TO SEE "CATS." [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, CAN YOU SPARE ME THE DETAILS? [ LAUGHTER ]
EXPLAIN THIS TO ME.
Jimmy: I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET. I DIDN'T KNOW REGIS PHILBIN, I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND WE WENT TO GO SEE "CATS" IT WAS A NEW YORK CITY TRIP AND I HAPPENED TO SEE REGIS PHILBIN AND I YELLED SOMETHING ABOUT, WHERE'S KATHIE LEE OR SOMETHING AND HE SAID LIKE, YOU NEVER HEAR WHERE'S REGIS. I SUDDENLY LOOK DOWN AND I GO, "WELL WHERE'S REGIS?" AND HE GOES, "WHO ARE YOU?" AND I GO, "WHO ARE YOU?" AND WE YELLED BACK AND FORTH AND THAT WAS THE BIG DEAL AND THEN I TURNED AROUND AND I WAS EMBARRASSED BUT IT WAS KIND OF COOL I GOT INTO A SCREAMING MATCH WITH REGIS PHILBIN.
WAS BRIGITTE BARDOT ON THE STREET? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THERE WAS A GNARLY TREE.
I'M GOING TO SAY THAT IS A A TRUE STORY.
I'M GOING TO SAY, BECAUSE YOU ADDED --
TIME'S UP.
NO, NO, BECAUSE YOU ADDED THE FACT THAT IT WAS, INDEED, I THINK IT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: THAT IN FACT, IS A A LIE. I DID NOT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO, NO, NO, NO ONE LOOSES. STOP, STOP, STOP. NO ONE LEAVE.
WE'RE GOING. WE'RE LEAVING.
Jimmy: THERE'S NO LOSERS. THERE'S NO LOSERS.
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST A --
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A LIAR.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S A FUN GAME. IT'S A FUN GAME.
YOU LIE. YOU LIED. YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME.
BY THE WAY, THANK YOU FOR TELLING US IT'S A FUN GAME. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT FILLS IN A LOT OF BLANKS FOR ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, IT'S FUN FOR ONE OF US.
YOU GO FIRST.
Jimmy: OKAY, HERE WE GO, I THINK NUMBER ONE. WE HAVEN'T CHOSEN THAT ONE YET.
AND THE WINNER IS -- OH. WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, TO PICK UP GIRLS, I WOULD SOMETIMES PRETEND TO BE AN EXCHANGE STUDENT FROM LONDON. [ LAUGHTER ]
HOW DOES THAT PICK UP GIRLS?
HELLO, YOU'RE A PRETTY BLOKE, AREN'T YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
A BLOKE? WHOA.
BREAKING NEWS. BREAKING NEWS.
LET ME TELL YOU. I'D SAY, "HELLO, I'M FROM LONDON AND I'M A BLOKE FROM LONDON AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD WANT --"
WOULDN'T AN UPPER CLASS ACCENT BE BETTER IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PICK UP GIRLS?
SOMETIMES I --
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU TODAY. I DO MY CARY GRANT OR SOMETIMES I'D -- HELLO, "YOU LOOK LOVELY."
DID ANYONE EVER BELIEVE YOU?
YES. THEY'D SAY, "OH MY GOD, ISN'T HIS ACCENT CUTE?"
AND WOULD THEY SLEEP WITH YOU?
NO.
I THINK IT'S TRUE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE HAVE MORE QUESTIONS TO ASK.
DOESN'T THAT VERIFY IT?
Jimmy: NO. NO. HE TRIED -- THE THING IS, TRUTH OR LIE, IS TO PICK UP GIRLS, HE USED AN ACCENT.
YES, I'D SAY HELLO. HELLO. AND SOMETIMES I'D DO FRENCH. NO, I WOULD DO ENGLISH.
Jimmy: I THINK -- I THINK IT'S TRUE BECAUSE I THINK EVERYONE -- THE BEATLES WERE REALLY COOL AND ALL THE ROCKS AND MICK JAGGER.
AND THERE'S ONE OTHER THING.
I WAS INTERRUPTING.
AND THEN I WOULD -- THEN I'D TELL THEM I WASN'T DOING AN ENGLISH ACCENT AND THEY WOULD LAUGH BECAUSE I WAS A BIT PLAYER.
I HAVE A PROBLEM HERE, BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY LOST. YOU HAVE WON. IF I AGREE WITH HIM AND I'M WRONG -- AND IT'S WRONG, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE WON. BUT IF I SAY I THINK IT'S FALSE, THEN YOU'LL ONLY HAVE HALF A WIN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND IS THAT A WIN FOR YOU?
THIS IS LIKE A MATH THING THAT I'VE WORKED OUT.
HALF A WIN FOR HIM, A FULL WIN FOR YOU.
JUST BEING WITH HIM I'M LOSING. I'M GOING TO SAY THAT SOUNDS TRUE TO ME.

Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH. ARE YOU -- IS IT AN ENGLISH ACCENT? OR ARE YOU JUST HITTING ON ME?
UM -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MARTIN SHORT -- YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S BRITISH. BRITISH.
Jimmy: HE'S THE BEST. HIS ENGLISH ACCENT, YEAH.
YEAH, IT'S NOT THE WORST ENGLISH ACCENT I'VE HEARD. NO, IT'S IRISH, BIT OF ENGLISH, YEAH, VIA AFRICA, VIA ETHIOPIA, WHERE I WAS BORN.
Jimmy: WOW.
SO IT'S PECULIAR TO ME.
Jimmy: HOW EXCITING. NO, PECULIAR TO ME? NO, I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. IT IS KIND OF AN IRISH THING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S BEEN CHANGING, IT'S VERY GOOD. ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. SO HOW MUCH TIME DID YOU SPEND IN IRELAND?
A FAIR BIT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH. I HAD A VERY PERIPATETIC CHILDHOOD. I BOUNCED AROUND BETWEEN ENGLAND AND IRELAND FOR MANY YEARS.
Jimmy: OH, YOU DID? OH, YEAH. WERE YOU RELIGIOUS AT ALL?
I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. WERE YOU AN ALTAR GIRL?
I WAS.
Jimmy: BECAUSE I WAS AN ALTAR BOY.
I KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I HEARD THAT. I'VE HEARD THE RUMOR THAT YOU WERE.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT A RUMOR. IT'S TRUE, MAN. IT'S A TRUE CONFESSION, I WAS REALLY INTO IT.
YOU WERE?
Jimmy: OH, I WAS FANTASTIC. I WAS, LIKE -- I USED TO RING THE BELLS.
YEAH, I WASN'T GREAT. I DID -- DID YOU KNOW WHEN TO RING THE BELLS?
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
I -- I --
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN DID I KNOW? YEAH, YOU HAVE TO. THAT'S THE --
I DID WING IT.
Jimmy: HOW DO YOU IMPROVISE WHEN TO RING THE BELL?
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THAT'S WHY -- I KIND OF JUST HAD TO HOPE INSTINCTIVELY I WOULD REMEMBER. THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T -- LIKE PEOPLE WERE, "OH, DO YOU REMEMBER THE MASS?" AND I WAS LIKE, "NO." BECAUSE I WAS JUST WORRIED THE ENTIRE MASS ABOUT THE BELLS. LLL I DIDN'T BOTHER LEARNING. I WAS A TERRIBLE -- I WAS TERRIBLE. I WAS TERRIBLE.
Jimmy: I LOVED IT, MAN. I THOUGHT IT WAS SO FUN AND I LOVED -- I MEAN, I GOT REALLY INTO IT. I THOUGHT THAT WAS MY CALLING.
YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I REALLY DID.
I THINK THAT IF YOU -- THERE IS THAT MOMENT, I THINK, IN EVERY CATHOLIC CHILD'S LIFE WHERE YOU GO, MAYBE, MAYBE THAT'S -- YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. I REALLY THOUGHT THAT WAS IT. IT WAS GREAT. I MEAN, I USED TO -- I THINK IT WAS KIND OF -- I FORGET WHO WE HAD ON THE SHOW. BUT THEY SAID, THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOUR FIRST STAGE EXPERIENCE.
BUT IT IS, ISN'T IT? BECAUSE YOU'RE ON A -- IT'S ACTUALLY AN ALTAR.
Jimmy: ALTAR, YEAH. IT'S NOT A STAGE AT ALL. BUT, NO, YOUR MOM IS IN THE PEW IN FRONT OF YOU GOING, LIKE, "GO, RING THE BILL, JIMMY." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "YOU'RE THE BEST BELL RINGER." SHE REALLY WAS.
THAT ANSWER AS LOT OF QUESTIONS.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT MY MOM -- YEAH.
NO, FOR, LIKE, WHY A A PERFORMER. YEAH, YEAH. GOT IT.
Jimmy: OH, I GOT THE BUG. I LOVED IT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND I USED TO DO WEDDINGS. I LOVE THE SMELL OF INCENSE.
DO WEDDINGS?
Jimmy: YEAH, I WAS THE ALTAR BOY AT PEOPLE'S -- THEY TRIED TO GET ME. THEY TRIED TO BOOK ME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I HAD TO TURN PEOPLE AWAY. THEY GO, "PLEASE BE THE ALTAR BOY AT MY WEDDING. I'VE SEEN YOUR BELL WORK." [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
Jimmy: I WAS -- BUT THIS WAS
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT YOU'RE INTO THAT. BUT THANK GOODNESS YOU GOT INTO ACTING AND CONGRATS ON EVERYTHING.

EDGERTON.
Jimmy: EDGERTON, WHO'S BEEN ON THE SHOW BEFORE. IT'S PHENOMENAL, BOTH YOU GUYS TOGETHER.
OH, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. BUT MAN, WHAT A TOUGH ROLE. I HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR ACTORS, BECAUSE NOT ONLY 'CAUSE I CAN'T BUT IT'S TOUGH. YOU'VE GOT TO DO THOSE SCENES AND I COULDN'T IMAGINE DOING THEM TWICE, YOU KNOW, FOR DIFFERENT TAKES.
IT'S SUCH A PRIVILEGE TO PLAY THIS SORT OF ROLE IN "LOVING." AND SUCH A PRIVILEGE WORKING WITH JOEL. AND JEFF NICHOLS, OUR LOVELY DIRECTOR. IT'S JUST -- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FILM. I REALLY URGE PEOPLE TO SEE IT AND DISCOVER THIS COUPLE, BECAUSE THEY'RE AN EXTRAORDINARY COUPLE. THEY CHANGED THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THEY INVALIDATED THESE PECULIAR LAWS THAT PREVENTED PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT RACES FROM MARRYING, AND DIFFERENT COLORS MARRYING.
