Jimmy: THEN I'M GOING TO UNSIGN EVERY CHRISTMAS CARD I EVER SENT TO THE CLINTONS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] UNSIGN -- AND I'LL UNSIGN IT. WHEN SOMEONE TOLD HIM THAT UNSIGN WASN'T REALLY A WORD, HE WAS LIKE, "FINE, THEN I UNSAY IT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE, HILLARY CLINTON WENT ON "MEET THE PRESS" YESTERDAY, AND SHE WAS ASKED WHAT SLOGAN DEFINES HER CAMPAIGN. SHE SAID, "STRONGER TOGETHER."

YOU'VE GOT MAIL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, THEY DIDN'T LIKE THAT.
Steve: GUESS NOT.
Jimmy: DELETE THAT SLOGAN. DELETE THAT SLOGAN. I SAW THAT THERE WAS A BRIEF SECURITY SCARE YESTERDAY WHEN SOME PARTY BALLOONS DRIFTED OVER THE WHITE HOUSE FENCE. THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF WERE PRETTY WORRIED, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SAW OBAMA TYING THOSE BALLOONS TO A LAWN CHAIR. TAKE IT EASY. [ LAUGHTER ] BYE, I'M OUT OF HERE. BYE GUYS, TAKE CARE. I'M THE OLD MAN FROM "UP." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND GET THIS, A TOP ADVISER TO OBAMA SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL KEEP A LOW POLITICAL PROFILE AFTER LEAVING OFFICE.

IT GOT WEIRD WHEN THE PERSON WHO ORDERED THE PIZZA WAS LIKE, OOH, I SAID NO PEPPERONI. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO, CAN YOU -- AND FINALLY, I SAW THAT THE DAD WHO LIVE STREAMED THE BIRTH OF HIS SON ON FACEBOOK LAST WEEK SAYS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, AND THAT THE VIDEO WASN'T MEANT FOR THE PUBLIC, JUST FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
