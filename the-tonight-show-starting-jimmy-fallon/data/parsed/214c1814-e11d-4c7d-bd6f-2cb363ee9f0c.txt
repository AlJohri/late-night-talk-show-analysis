Jimmy: HI, NICE TO MEET YOU. MY CAT PEES IN THE TOILET. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEN YOU CREATED MIRANDA --
YES.
Jimmy: WHICH IS -- I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC CHARACTER.
OH, THANKS.
Jimmy: IT'S SO UNLIKE YOU AND IT'S SO FUNNY AND DIFFERENT. I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE NOT FUNNY. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S FINE. I GET IT.
Jimmy: YOU'LL SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. SHE'S VERY KIND OF AWKWARD, BUT THE STORY I REALLY WANT TO HEAR IS I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WORKED AT DISNEYLAND.
YEAH, I DID WORK AT DISNEYLAND.
Jimmy: AND MIRANDA KIND OF GOT YOU FIRED FROM THERE.
YEAH, AND BY KIND OF, SHE DID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH, I LOVED WORKING AT DISNEYLAND.
Jimmy: I LOVE DISNEYLAND.
I WANNA BE THERE EVERY DAY. I WANNA BE THERE RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT I LOVED WORKING THERE. AND I GOT TO SING IN THE PARADES AND IN THE DIFFERENT SHOWS, AND IT WAS AWESOME, BUT WE DID SIX SHOWS A DAY, AND SO I WOULD ENTERTAIN MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS AND THE CAST BY DOING MIRANDA IN THE MIDDLE OF PERFORMANCES, WHICH WAS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL, BECAUSE MY CHARACTER, MIRANDA, CANNOT SING, CANNOT ACT, AND IS REALLY INAPPROPRIATE AND TO ACT THAT WAY AT DISNEYLAND WAS NOT OKAY. SO, YOU KNOW, I'D BE LIKE DOING THIS ONE SHOW WHERE IT WAS LIKE A ROCK CONCERT FOR 2-YEAR-OLDS, LIKE THERE'S MICKEY MOUSE AND I HAD TO BE ALL BUBBLY. I'M LIKE, HI, GUYS, I'M CASEY, YOU READY TO HAVE SOME FUN TODAY? [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD LIKE SWITCH INTO MIR -- INTO THE CHARACTER, AND ONE THING I DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT THEY HAVE, LIKE, SPIES BASICALLY AT DISNEYLAND WHICH ARE PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE JUST NORMAL PEDESTRIANS, ENJOYING THE PARK, BUT THEY'RE REALLY THERE TO JUDGE YOUR PERFORMANCE.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
AND SO I GOT A CALL FROM DISNEY ONE DAY, THEY WERE LIKE, COLLEEN, WE LOVE HAVING YOU HERE, BUT WE FEEL LIKE MAYBE YOU SHOULD START WORKING ON YOUR VOCALS A LITTLE BIT MORE. THEY'RE SOUNDING A LITTLE SOUR. BECAUSE I WAS SINGING AS MIRANDA IN THE PARK.
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT YOU'RE DOING YOUR CHARACTER.
I KNOW, I KNOW. WELL, WHICH WAS NOT OKAY, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: NO, I UNDERSTAND. YEAH. WE PLAYED PICTIONARY. IT WAS ME AND MARTIN SHORT VERSUS MIRANDA AND JERRY SEINFELD.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND I JUST WANNA SHOW A PICTURE THERE.
ONE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER FOR SURE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH. BUT WE HAD FUN. I REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING WITH HER.
YEAH, IT WAS SUPER FUN.
Jimmy: AND I WAS JUST THINKING, MAYBE IF THERE'S ANY WAY THAT YOU COULD MAYBE SHOW ME HOW TO -- HOW TO -- CAN YOU GET INTO CHARACTER?
YOU WANT ME TO BECOME MIRANDA RIGHT NOW?
Jimmy: IS THAT POSSIBLE?
YEAH, I CAN DO IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
OH MY GOD, I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS HAPPENING. THERE'S A SHIRT RIGHT HERE. I WILL DO IT.
Jimmy: HOW DO WE DO IT?
YEAH, I WILL DO IT.
Jimmy: HOW CAN I HELP YOU? DO I DISTRACT?
YEAH, YOU CAN DISTRACT.
Jimmy: ALRIGHT, HERE WE GO.
DISTRACT. DISTRACT, JIMMY. [ CHEERS ] [ LAUGHTER ] KEEP GOING, JIMMY. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: ALMOST THERE, ALMOST THERE .
THIS IS GREAT. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SO GOOD AT THIS. [ CHEERS ] DON'T SIT DOWN. THE FINALE.
Jimmy: NOT YET. ♪♪ OH, MY GOSH. YOU'RE -- YOU ARE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON. YOU ARE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON THAN SOMEONE WHO WAS JUST SITTING HERE A MINUTE AGO.
JIMMY, IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD, I'M NOT KIDDING.
Jimmy: MIRANDA.
YES.
Jimmy: IT'S SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK HERE ON THE SHOW.
I KNOW. STOP HITTING ON ME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M NOT HITTING ON YOU. I SAID IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK ON THE SHOW.
I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, "HELLO." OKAY, LISTEN, JIMMY, I HAD SO MUCH FUN LAST TIME I WAS HERE. HOWEVER, I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOUR SHOW SINCE I WAS HERE, BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF YOU BEFORE. AND LET ME TELL YOU, YOU ARE NOT A VERY GOOD HOST.

Jimmy: YOU CAN TEACH ME. CAN YOU GIVE ME A TIP?
OKAY, NUMBER ONE. I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE FAMOUS PEOPLE ON YOUR SHOW, OKAY? SO, LIKE, JON HAMM, I NEVER HEARD OF HIM BEFORE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S VERY FAMOUS.
WHAT IS HE FAMOUS FOR? MAKING BOLOGNA? JON HAMM? I NEVER HEARD OF HIM IN MY LIFE.
Jimmy: THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. WHY WOULD JON HAMM MAKE BOLOGNA?
HAM, BOLOGNA, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY, THAT'S A DECENT TIP, YEAH.
THAT'S NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, YOU HAVE A SHOW ALL ABOUT YOURSELF, YET YOU'RE ASKING PEOPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM. IF I WERE A HOST, I WOULD MAKE PEOPLE TELL ME THINGS ABOUT ME. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU WERE MY GUEST AND I'M THE HOST, OH, HELLO. WE HAVE JIMMY FALLON ON THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. OH, IT'S SO GREAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DO NOT.
