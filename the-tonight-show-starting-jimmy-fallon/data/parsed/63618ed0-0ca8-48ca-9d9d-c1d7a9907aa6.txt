Jimmy: YEAH. THE COOLEST. AND -- NICO.
NICO.
Jimmy: AND NICO IS --
WELL, NICO, THE INCREDIBLE SINGER.
Jimmy: OH, VELVET UNDERGROUND, NICO.
EXACTLY. YEAH.
Jimmy: SEE, I WAS THINKING "NEO", KEANU REEVES. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I WAS THINKING IT WAS LIKE "NICO."
NO. NOT HIM. NOT HIM.
Jimmy: AND YOU WERE PREGNANT WHILE YOU WERE SHOOTING "ROGUE."
WHOA, YES I WAS INDEED.
Jimmy: REALLY?
THAT WAS -- OH! NEVER AGAIN.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: IS IT HARDER TO ACT WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT?
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GOT TWO MAJOR JOBS GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW? THERE'S A MASSIVE JOB GOING ON DOWN HERE. AND, YOU KNOW, AND TO BE PERFORMING A SCENE WHERE I'M BEING INCREDIBLY SERIOUS. AND DOWN HERE, I'M JUST BEING, LIKE, KICKED FROM ALL ANGLES. IT WAS JUST RIDICULOUS.
Jimmy: VERY DISTRACTING. YEAH.
I MEAN, LITERALLY. AND I WAS EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT BY THE END. YOU CANNOT TELL IN THE SHOW WHEN YOU WATCH IT.
Jimmy: HOW DID THEY -- COVER YOU UP?
YOU JUST GOT TO GET INTO ALL THESE DIFFERENT ANGLES TO TRY TO COVER UP THIS BELLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE WHOLE SEGMENT -- THE WHOLE SEASON OF "ROGUE", YOU'RE LIKE THIS.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE I'M TRYING TO --
Jimmy: I THINK I KNOW WHO DID IT. YEAH, YEAH. LIKE, "I'LL BE RIGHT BACK EVERYBODY. "HEY, EVERYONE. HOW'S IT GOING?" [ LAUGHTER ]
MISSED ME LIKE THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "MAKING SURE IT'S OKAY IN HERE. ALL RIGHT. TAKE CARE." SIDE ACTING.
A LOT OF THAT AND A LOT OF SIDE ACTING.
Jimmy: YEAH. ARE YOU VERY EXTRA EMOTIONAL?
I WAS BESIDE MYSELF EVERY SINGLE DAY. I WOULD BE SO HAPPY WHEN WE HAD A SCENE WHERE I -- HAVE TO BE FEROCIOUS AND ANGRY. BECAUSE I'D GO CRAZY. OR CRYING. I MEAN, IF I HAD SCENES WHERE I HAD TO VOMIT, I WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PLEASE WRITE ME IN A A SCENE WHERE I CAN VOMIT. I'D BE GREAT AT THAT. YEAH. NOW, WHAT IS HAPPENING THIS SEASON ON "ROGUE"?
THIS SEASON -- WELL, THE LAST SEASON, I WAS THE UNDERCOVER COP. EVERYTHING GOT A BIT HAIRY AND SO I VOWED NEVER TO GO UNDERCOVER AGAIN. I'M A HANDLER. I'M LOOKING AFTER AN OPERATIVE WHO GOES MISSING UNDER VERY GRIZZLY CIRCUMSTANCES. SO, I HAVE TO GO BACK UNDER --
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO GO UNDERCOVER.
TO GO FIND HER.
Jimmy: AH-HA! SEE? THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
SLIDE THAT THING ALL THE WAY.
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AND I WANT TO ALSO SAY, LAST TIME WE WERE HERE, WE WERE MAKING FUNNY FACES AND STUFF. AND I LOVE WHEN WE DO THIS ONE WHERE WE -- OUR LIPS GO UNDER OUR TEETH?
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND WE DID HALF THE INTERVIEW LIKE THAT. YEAH.
WE DID!
Jimmy: THAT WAS REALLY FUN.
WE'RE SO SILLY.
Jimmy: I KNOW BUT IT MADE ME LAUGH. I LOVED IT.
IT WAS GREAT!
Jimmy: BUT THEN, YOU -- THIS IS HOW FUN YOU ARE. THANDIE GOES ON SET AND YOU HAVE TO DO A SCENE WHERE YOU'RE TAKING YOUR COP I.D. PHOTO.
I'VE GOT MY FULL REGALIA ON, YEAH.
