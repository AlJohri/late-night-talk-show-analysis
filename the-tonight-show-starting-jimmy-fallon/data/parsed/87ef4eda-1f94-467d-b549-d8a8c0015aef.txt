Questlove: 416 T.O.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HEY, GUYS, WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WHAT A GREAT NEW YORK CROWD. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST JIMMY FALLON. YOU GUYS, THIS IS OUR LAST SHOW IN NEW YORK BEFORE WE HEAD OUT TO DO A WEEK OF SHOWS IN L.A. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHICH MEANS I HAVE ABOUT THREE DAYS TO GET TAN AND LOSE 40 POUNDS. SO I'M VERY EXCITED. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. IN HIS VICTORY SPEECH AFTER THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY DONALD TRUMP CLAIMED THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE AS HIGH AS 42%. HE MIGHT BE RIGHT BECAUSE HILLARY JUST FIRED HER ENTIRE CAMPAIGN STAFF. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO I MEAN, IT'S CLOSE.
Steve: THAT'S CLOSE.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. IT'S BEEN A ROUGH WEEK FOR HILLARY AFTER BERNIE SANDERS WON THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY BY MORE THAN 20 POINTS. BERNIE SAID HE'S ALWAYS LIKED NEW HAMPSHIRE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE HE WAS AROUND WHEN IT WAS STILL OLD HAMPSHIRE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE, HILLARY CLINTON RECENTLY SAID IT'S A LOW BLOW FOR BERNIE SANDERS TO CRITICIZE HER FOR NOT BEING PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH. AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT STORY, DO NOT GOOGLE CLINTON LOW BLOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST DON'T DO IT. SAVE YOURSELF. SAVE YOURSELF GETTING FIRED. DON'T DO IT. AFTER FINISHING SECOND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE'S REPUBLICAN PRIMARY JOHN KASICH SAID HE CAN HANDLE ATTACKS BY DONALD TRUMP SAYING, "I'M NOT GOING TO SIT THERE AND BE A MARSHMALLOW AND HAVE SOMEBODY POUND ME." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN CHRIS CHRISTIE WAS LIKE, "ANYONE ELSE A TURNED ON AS I AM? MARSHMALLOW?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: A POUND OF THEM.
Jimmy: THIS IS INTERESTING. A NEW POLL RELEASED THIS WEEK SHOWS THAT TWO-THIRDS OF CANADIANS FEAR A DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY. ESPECIALLY ONE CANADIAN IN PARTICULAR. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT FAIR.
Steve: HE'S AN AMERICAN.
Jimmy: BEFORE WINNING THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, IT SEEMED LIKE DONALD TRUMP WAS REALLY GOING AFTER JEB BUSH. DID YOU FEEL THAT WAY? IN FACT, HE RECENTLY MADE FUN OF JEB BUSH FOR HAVING HIS MOM HELP HIM WITH HIS CAMPAIGN. THIS IS REAL. THIS IS AN ACTUAL TWEET FROM TRUMP. IT SAID, " WOW, JEB BUSH, WHOSE CAMPAIGN IS A TOTAL DISASTER, HAD TO BRING IN MOMMY TO TAKE A A SLAP AT ME. NOT NICE." [ LAUGHTER ] AS YOU CAN IMAGINE BARBARA BUSH WASN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT. SHE DECIDED TO RESPOND WITH HER OWN TWEET. "HEY, T-BAG, YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY, SAY IT TO MY FACE, #REALTALK, #BUSHWHACK." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHE'S TOUGHER THAN SHE LOOKS. DON'T MESS WITH BARBARA BUSH.
Steve: WHY WOULD YOU.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SAY HAPPY 63rd BIRTHDAY TO JEB BUSH. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JEB. [ APPLAUSE ] IN HONOR OF HIS BIG DAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE WROTE ON HIS FACEBOOK WALL. CHECK OUT WHAT THEY POSTED. FIRST UP, DONALD TRUMP WROTE, "YOU CALL THIS A WALL? THIS IS A SORRY EXCUSE FOR A A WALL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AFTER THAT, BERNIE SANDERS WROTE, "MAYBE YOU SHOULD FOCUS LESS ON YOUR BIRTHDAY AND MORE ON SHARING YOUR CAKE WITH THE 99% OF AMERICANS WHO DON'T HAVE A BIRTHDAY TODAY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT UP, MARCO RUBIO WROTE, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY. HOPE IT'S A GOOD ONE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. HOPE IT'S A GOOD ONE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HOPE IT'S A A GOOD ONE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, BEN CARSON WROTE, "I'M STANDING OUTSIDE WITH THE PRESIDENT FOR YOU. JUST CALL MY NAME WHEN YOU WANT ME TO WALK IN AND I'LL DEFINITELY WALK OVER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, THE OTHER CANDIDATES DID MORE THAN JUST MAKE POSTS TO JEB'S FACEBOOK WALL. THEY ACTUALLY GOT TOGETHER AND SANG HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO HIM. IT'S REALLY SWEET.
