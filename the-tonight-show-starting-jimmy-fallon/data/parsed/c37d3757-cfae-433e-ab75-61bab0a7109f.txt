THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. WOW, YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT. LOOKING GOOD. LOOKING GREAT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY IS THAT POPE FRANCIS ARRIVED IN WASHINGTON, D.C. TODAY. I SAW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA ACTUALLY PICKED HIM UP AT THE AIRPORT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED HOW THE POPE WILL GET BACK TO THE AIRPORT, OBAMA WAS LIKE, "UBER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I DON'T KNOW. IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM." THAT'S RIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA PICKED UP POPE FRANCIS AT THE AIRPORT. BECAUSE WHAT BETTER WAY TO ALLEVIATE THE TRAFFIC THE POPE IS ABOUT TO CAUSE THAN SENDING OUT A PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT YOU WANTED TO MAKE IT HOME FOR DINNER, YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT A MONTH AGO. NO. THE TRIP TO WASHINGTON, D.C. HAS ACTUALLY BEEN VERY EDUCATIONAL FOR THE POPE. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE'S ONLY EVER READ ABOUT PURGATORY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT TOP CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS SENT A STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE AND SENATE WITH GUIDELINES FOR POPE FRANCIS'S VISIT, INCLUDING A REQUEST TO NOT SHAKE HIS HAND. APPARENTLY THEY'RE WORRIED THAT IF POLITICIANS TOUCH THE POPE THEY'LL BURST INTO FLAMES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IN ADDITION TO THE NO SHAKING HANDS, CONGRESS WAS GIVEN A LOT OF RULES ABOUT THE POPE'S VISIT. CHECK OUT SOME OF THESE OTHER ONES HERE -- FIRST THERE'S THE, "DON'T FAKE SNEEZE JUST TO GET AN EASY BLESSING OUT OF THE POPE." [ LAUGHTER ] ACHOO. [ APPLAUSE ] SO NICE, THOUGHTFUL. DON'T SAY, "POPE, THERE HE IS," WHEN HE WALKS IN THE ROOM. [ LAUGHTER ] HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT. THAT'S DISRESPECTFUL. HE DOESN'T ENJOY IT. POPE, THERE IT IS! POPE, THERE IT IS! ♪♪ POPE, THERE IT IS! POPE, THERE IT IS! ♪♪ NO, CAN'T DO THAT. NO, HE DOESN'T ENJOY THAT. DON'T DO THAT.
Steve: DON'T DO IT.

Steve: NO.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, WITH THE POPE IN AMERICA AND THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE GOING ON, I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE BIG STORY IN AMERICA.
THE MOST NEW YORK THING YOU'LL EVER SEE. CELL PHONE FOOTAGE CAPTURING A A RAT SCROUNGING UP A SLICE OF PIZZA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS LITTLE GUY JUST WANTED TO TAKE SOME DINNER ON THE GO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WOW.

CRAZY THING IS THAT VIDEO WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN BY ANOTHER RAT. [ LAUGHTER ] "HEY, TONY. SEE IF YOU CAN LIFT THAT PIZZA. I GOTTA POST THIS ON YOUTUBE." [ LAUGHTER ] GUYS, I FOUND THIS OUT YESTERDAY HILLARY CLINTON VISITED NEW ORLEANS TO SPEAK ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IT WAS PRETTY EMBARRASSING WHEN SOMEONE THREW BEADS AT HER AND YELLED, "WOO-HOO! SHOW US YOUR EMAILS!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: RUDE.
Jimmy: I DON'T HAVE TO SHOW YOU MY EMAILS.
Steve: IT'S RUDE.
Jimmy: I SAW THAT 128 CELEBRITIES POSTED A LETTER TO BERNIE SANDERS'S CAMPAIGN WEBSITE GIVING HIM THEIR ENDORSEMENT. 128 CELEBRITIES. AND YOU CAN TELL BY THE LIST THAT MANY OF THESE ENDORSEMENTS ARE BECAUSE BERNIE IS PRO-WEED. TAKE A LOOK HERE. YOU HAVE CHEECH AND CHONG. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU HAVE CAP'N CRUNCH, AND YOU HAVE JEB BUSH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOT A SURPRISE. I GUESS HE'S -- I DON'T KNOW, HE'S INTO -- SOME TV NEWS HERE. I SAW THAT "THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW" RETURNED TO THE AIR THIS WEEK AND CELEBRATED ITS 25th SEASON. WOW. THAT'S A LONG TIME. IN FACT, IT'S BEEN ON SO LONG GUESTS WERE LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I FEEL LIKE Y'ALL DO KNOW ME." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] "Y'ALL DO KNOW ME. AT ONE POINT, Y'ALL DIDN'T KNOW ME. BUT AT THIS POINT, Y'ALL DO KNOW ME." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LAST NIGHT, WE HAD A BIG HIT HERE ON NBC. DID YOU SEE THIS THING? IT WAS FANTASTIC.

Jimmy: NO.
HIS FAVORITE CAR AT THAT TIME WAS A CAMARO BECAUSE IT WAS FRESH OFF OF, "TRANSFORMERS." ANOTHER MOVIE I WAS IN. HE LOVED BUMBLEBEE.
Jimmy: YOU REMEMBER, BY THE WAY -- DO YOU REMEMBER GOING ON THE TRANSFORMER RIDE?
YES, I DO.
Jimmy: WITH ME?
NO. [ LAUGHTER ] WAIT A MINUTE --
Jimmy: NO, I REMEMBER THIS STORY. THAT'S WHY IT'S FUNNY. I GOT TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO TAKE A RIDE BECAUSE I WAS AN NBC-UNIVERSAL EMPLOYEE. AND YOU COULDN'T COME ON THE RIDE BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T AN NBC-UNIVERSAL EMPLOYEE YET.
NO, 'CAUSE I WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF JIMMY FALLON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, BUT THE FUNNY PART IS, YOU'RE LIKE, "I'M IN THIS MOVIE." [ LAUGHTER ]
YES. NO, SO I REMEMBER NOW. THEY LET YOU ON THE FIRST RIDE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I HAD TO RIDE WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION. [ LAUGHTER ] JIMMY GOT SORTED IN AND EVERYTHING --
Jimmy: YOU'E LIKE, "I'M IN THIS MOVIE!"
-- I GOT, "NO YOU'VE GOT TO RIDE WITH TICKET HOLDERS, SIR." I'M LIKE, "THAT'S ME! RIGHT THERE, IN THAT CLINTON PORTIS JERSEY! THAT'S ME!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I'M THE ONLY BLACK GUY OTHER THAN TYRESE IN THIS MOVIE!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY! OKAY, ALL RIGHT! TYRESE, ALL RIGHT. I TOOK THE RIDE WITH TYRESE. BUT YOU WERE THERE TOO.
YES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GOSH, THAT WAS FUNNY. THAT MADE ME LAUGH. SO HE DROVE A TRANSFORMERS CAR? NO.
NO, WE'RE RAIDERS FANS. I TOOK HIM TO OAKLAND FOR A A WEEKEND TO GO TO A RAIDERS GAME. I RENTED A BUMBLEBEE CAMARO. AND ON THE WAY BACK TO THE AIRPORT THE NEXT DAY, I FOUND AN OPEN FIELD AND PARKING LOT. AND PUT HIM BEHIND THE WHEEL AT NINE-YEARS-OLD AND VIDEO TAPED THE ENTIRE DRIVE.
Jimmy: HOW WAS HE DRIVING?
HE WAS GREAT, UNTIL HE ALMOST HIT THE LIGHT POLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING! NO, THEY CAN'T DO THAT.
YEAH, BUT HE WAS NINE SO I COULDN'T REALLY BLAME HIM. I WAS REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT --
Jimmy: YOU SHOULDN'T -- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO PUT HIM BEHIND THE WHEEL ANYWAY!
THAT'S WHY I WAS NERVOUS, BECAUSE I GOT THIS FULL-COVERAGE INSURANCE, BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE COVERED ME PUTTING MY NINE-YEAR-OLD BEHIND THE WHEEL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO! YOU HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABILITY THE BABY, NOT THE INSURANCE.
NO, THE BABY? IT HAS AIR BAGS, HE WAS FINE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S FINE.
Jimmy: SO HE HAS THE ACTING BUG LIKE DAD.
YES, HE DOES. YES, HE DOES.
Jimmy: AND HE LIKES PERFORMING? DOES HE LIKE IT?
HE LOVES PERFORMING. YOU KNOW, HE ACTUALLY AUDITIONED FOR "BLACK-ISH," DIDN'T GET THE ROLE. WENT OUT AND GOT HIS OWN TELEVISION SHOW, "RICHIE RICH," AND THEN INVITED ME DOWN TO THE SET AND HAD THEM HIRE ME AS HIS FATHER ON HIS SHOW. AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, "THAT'S HOW NEPOTISM WORKS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE HIRED YOU.
YEAH, I WAS LIKE, "WOW!" SMART KID. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SMART KID. YOU REMEMBER GETTING THE FIRST TIME PERFORMING? 'CAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE A GREAT PERFORMER.
I DID. SIXTH GRADE GRADUATION, THEY HAD ME SING "THE GREATEST LOVE OF ALL."
Jimmy: WHITNEY HOUSTON? [ LAUGHTER ]
YES.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
AND THE BAD THING IS -- I TRIED TO SING IT LIKE WHITNEY HOUSTON IN SIXTH GRADE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S A TOUGH THING TO DO.
IT'S A TOUGH THING. I CRACKED EVERY OTHER NOTE, BUT I GOT THROUGH THE SONG.
Jimmy: YOU GOT THROUGH IT. THAT'S A SONG IF YOU SCREW IT UP, IT'S ONE OF THE LONGEST, WORST THINGS YOU COULD EVER HEAR.
YES, AND I NEVER LIVED IT DOWN.
Jimmy: YOU CAN GIVE IT A A SHOT IF YOU WANT TO NOW. IF YOU WANTED TO GIVE IT A A LITTLE TRY. A LITTLE BIT. A LITTLE TASTE.
