Jimmy: NOW, THIS IS GOING TO BOTHER ME. WHAT ARE YOUNG TALKING ABOUT?
THE FULL MOON FROM NEW YORK CITY, IF IT LOOKS LIKE THAT, IT'S LIKE 4:00 IN THE MORNING. AND YOUR SHOW IS NOT ON AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OOHS ]
Jimmy: BUT THIS ISN'T EVEN A A PLANET OR ANYTHING. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A -- ACID TRIP. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS THING IS. YOU KNOW, I GOT TO TELL EVERYONE HERE. UMM, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS. HE'S A -- HE'S A GENIUS, A SCIENCE GENIUS. BUT, HE'S ALSO A PRETTY GOOD BOWLER.
OKAY BOWLER.
Jimmy: YEAH. OKAY, BUT WE BOWLED TOGETHER.
WE DID. I ENJOYED THAT. WE HAD A LITTLE CHARITY THING GOING THERE.
Jimmy: IT WAS REALLY FUN. WE PLAYED, CHRIS HARDWICK AND THE TEAM AT "NERDIST."
I WAS DEPUTIZED BY THE NERDIST FOLKS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BECAUSE I'M CARD CARRYING -- NERD.
Jimmy: VERY GOOD. WE WENT, AND IT WAS JUST ALL FUN. WE JUST HAD FUN.
HOW MANY DECIMALS OF PI DO YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE DECIMAL POINT. [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW THAT. BUT, I -- LET'S SHOW A CLIP OF US HAVING FUN BOWLING.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
THE ONE THING THAT BOWLING IS ABOUT IS PHYSICS.
AND, IF WE CAN'T WIN IN A A GAME OF PHYSICS, WHO ARE WE?
All: CARL SAGAN!
THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ] [ BOWLING SOUNDS ]
OH!
YEAH, THEY SHOULD BE.
CREATIONISM! [ BOWLING SOUNDS ] [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT WAS A DIRTY BOWL, RIGHT THERE.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT WAS AURORA BORING-ALIS, RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ SHE BLINDED ME WITH SCIENCE ♪ ♪ SHE BLINDED ME WITH SCIENCE ♪
THERE YOU GO. THAT'S IT. THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT. [ CHEERING ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO, RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JONATHAN'S IN HIS UNDERPANTS. WE HAD TO YELL "CARL SAGAN."
YEAH, YEAH. TRYING TO DISTRACT ME.
Jimmy: IT WORKED. BUT, HEY, CONGRATS ON "COSMOS."
THANK YOU. OH, MY, LABOR OF LOVE.
Jimmy: IT'S A BIG DEAL.
YEAH. IT WAS ON NETWORK, AND ON, LIKE, SUNDAY NIGHT, WHEN EVERYBODY'S HOME. AND PEOPLE GET ON THE COUCH TOGETHER -- MULTIPLE GENERATIONS -- AND THEY WATCH IT.
Jimmy: RIGHT.
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE DID THAT SINCE, LIKE, "ED SULLIVAN" OR SOMETHING.
Jimmy: YEAH, OR -- OR THE NEW "TONIGHT SHOW."
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH. "THE TONIGHT SHOW." YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT ANWAYS, IT IS A A BIG DEAL, THOUGH. I THINK, UHH -- JUST LEAVE IT UPSIDE DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ]
IN SPACE, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
Jimmy: GOSH. [ LAUGHTER ]
THERE IS NO UP OR DOWN IN SPACE.
Jimmy: BUT, YOU GOT NOMINATED -- THANK YOU.
YEAH.
Jimmy: GOSH, YOU REALLY ARE A NERD. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GOT NOMINATED -- I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS FOR A CRITICS' CHOICE AWARD.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S A BIG DEAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE UP AGAINST -- YOU'RE UP AGAINST "DEADLIEST CATCH." IT'S IN THE REALITY --
IT'S IN THE REALITY SEGMENT BECAUSE THIS DEFINES REALITY I THINK. BUT, IT'S -- WE'RE UP AGAINST, LIKE, "DUCK DYNASTY." AND THEN, I THOUGHT, "NO, I DON'T MIND THE DUCK PEOPLE," YOU KNOW? BUT -- AND, I DON'T EVEN MIND IF WE LOSE IN THE CATEGORY, BUT I DON'T WANT TO LOSE TO "DUCK DYNASTY."
Jimmy: YOU DON'T.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN IF THE "COSMOS" LOST TO DUCK PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: START QUACKING. BUT NO YOU UP -- "TOP GEAR," "MYTHBUSTERS" IS GOOD. "UNDERCOVER BOSS" IS -- WHAT? CRITICS' CHOICE FOR "UNDERCOVER BOSS"?
I DON'T -- DID I MAKE THE LIST? I DIDN'T MAKE THE LIST.
Jimmy: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT SHOW?
NO, NOT "UNDERCOVER BOSS." NO.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE A DUDE COMES IN WITH THE WORST WIG -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE, AND, LIKE, A FAKE MUSTACHE AND HE'S GOING -- AND, HE GOES TO, LIKE, A A SUBWAY. AND, HE'S LIKE, "UH, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A SANDWICH. WHAT, UHH -- WHAT IS A SANDWICH?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, THEY GO, "YOU DO THIS." "UHH, I DON'T KNOW. WHERE'S THE MEAT? WHERE -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING HERE." AND THEN, THEY GO, "SURPRISE. I'M THE BOSS."
IT'S THE BOSS IS INCOGNITO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND THE GUYS LIKE, "I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE CEO OF THE COMPANY IS." THIS IS -- THAT'S NOMINATED FOR A A CRITIC'S CHOICE AWARD? I HOPE YOU LOSE TO "UNDERCOVER BOSS." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING.
NO, THAT'D BE CRAZY. CRAZY.
Jimmy: THAT WOULD BE -- IF THE UNIVERSE EXISTS, YOU WILL LOSE TO "UNDERCOVER BOSS." [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVE YOU, BUDDY. COME BACK WHATEVER YOU --
