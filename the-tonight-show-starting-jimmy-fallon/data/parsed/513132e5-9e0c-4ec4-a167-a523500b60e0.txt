I WOULD LOVE TO GET BACK TOGETHER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I WENT NUTS! WHEN I SAW YOU GUYS AT THE OLYMPICS, I GO, "THAT IS EXACTLY COOL." THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SHOULD -- IT WAS SO COOL.
I WOULD LOVE TO GET BACK TOGETHER AND DO SOMETHING WITH THE SPICE GIRLS.
Jimmy: YOU DO, YEAH.
AND I'M THE ONE THAT KEEPS ON SAYING IT. SO, IF I SAY IT ENOUGH, MAYBE IT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN AGAIN.
Jimmy: YEAH, ALL RIGHT, GOOD. YEAH, WE CAN GET IT OUT THERE. ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
I'D LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: BUT WILL YOU -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TIME DO IT BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE YOU DOING "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT" BUT YOU'RE ALSO DOING "THE X FACTOR" IN THE UK. "THE VOICE KIDS" IN AUSTRALIA.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I MEAN -- AND THEN, YOU HAVE KIDS AS WELL.
I DO. I HAVE FOUR LOVELY DAUGHTERS.
Jimmy: I MEAN -- I MEAN -- YOU'RE SUPER BUSY. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HAVE TIME TO DO ALL THIS STUFF.
IT KIND OF FITS TOGETHER, YOU KNOW? I DO -- I'M DONE WITH SYDNEY RIGHT NOW. AND I'M NOW GOING TO BE GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FROM NEW YORK TO UK. AND ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO BE ACROSS THE STREET FROM YOU NEXT WEEK BECAUSE WE GO LIVE AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING -- YOU'LL BE MY NEIGHBOR. IF YOU NEED A CUP OF SUGAR, YOU CAN COME OVER HERE. YEAH.
THERE YOU GO. DEFINITELY!
Jimmy: OR IF MY FOREHEAD NEEDS SOME MAKEUP, I MEAN, I CAN CALL YOU AND WE CAN TAKE CARE OF IT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO YOU'RE WHITTLING IT DOWN. SO, THE 48 ACTS WILL COME OVER HERE AND DO LIVE PERFORMANCES.
THAT'S RIGHT, YES.
Jimmy: WHICH IS EXCITING. I LOVE THOSE SHOWS.
REALLY EXCITING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY INTERESTING TALENT. FROM MAGIC ACTS, TO DANGER ACTS. SOME REALLY INTERESTING DANCE TROUPES. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
Jimmy: GOOD. I WANT TO SEE. BECAUSE TWO YEARS AGO, I WAS WATCHING "AMERICA' TALENT." THE WINNER WAS A DOG ACT. SOME DOGS THAT JUMPED AROUND. SO AMERICA'S BEST TALENT WAS A A BUNCH OF DOGS, WHICH WAS GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, LAST YEAR --
KENICHI.
Jimmy: IT WAS KENICHI EBINA FROM JAPAN.
AND HE WAS VERY CREATIVE.
Jimmy: BUT HE WAS A JAPANESE MAN.
YES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHO WON --
I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
Jimmy: NOT THAT I'M AGAINST IT, BUT I JUST DON'T SEE. SO, I'M BEEN WATCHING "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT" AND I'M GLAD THAT A JAPANESE MAN WON, BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LOOKING AT THE JUDGES AND I GO, OH, MEL B. I LOVE MEL B. FROM THE UK.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE HAVE --
THAT'S NOT BAD!
Jimmy: THANK YOU. I WORKED ON THAT. HEIDI KLUM FROM GERMANY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HOWIE MANDEL FROM CANADA. [ LAUGHTER ] HOWARD STERN IS THE ONLY AMERICAN JUDGE ON "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT."
THAT'S TRUE. THAT IS TRUE.
Jimmy: IT'S ALL UP TO HIM. ALL THE WEIGHT IS ON HIS SHOULDERS AND I FEEL BAD FOR HIM. A LOT OF PRESSURE BECAUSE HE'S AMERICAN. AMERICA'S ROOTING -- THEY WANT TO SEE WHO IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT WINNER OF "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT." IS THERE ANY WAY -- DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE AMERICAN?
WELL, WE'LL SEE IF THEY'LL BE AMERICAN. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I THINK, IN AMERICA -- IT'S SUCH A COLORFUL PLACE. ANYBODY CAN COME AND LIVE HERE. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT AMERICA. IT'S A LAND OF OPPORTUNITY.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I GUESS. I GUESS, BUT LAST YEAR'S WINNER WAS FROM JAPAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
I KNOW. THAT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: SORRY. BUT THIS YEAR -- SO, DO YOU HAVE ANY FAVORITES BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU -- I'LL TELL YOU WHO I'D LIKE TO SEE.
GO ON.
Jimmy: I LIKE THE MAGICIANS.
I LIKE THE MAGICIANS AND I DON'T USUALLY.
Jimmy: OH, YOU DON'T LIKE MAGIC?
NO. BUT THIS TIME AROUND --
Jimmy: I FEEL LIKE WE NEED A A MAGICIAN.
YEAH! I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH YOU.
Jimmy: WE HAVE DAVID BLAINE. WE HAVE PENN AND TELLER. THERE'S SOME GOOD MAGICIANS OUT THERE, BUT THIS -- I THINK WE NEED A NEW MAGICIAN.
WELL, WE DO HAVE SOME GOOD ONES. AND WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD DANGER ACTS. SOME GOOD SWORD SWALLOWERS. ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.
Jimmy: THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD TV, AND GOOD FUN LIKE THAT. BUT I THINK A MAGICIAN IS THE WAY TO GO.
YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M WITH YOU ON THAT ONE. I'M WITH YA.
Jimmy: YOU'RE WITH ME.
I CAN'T TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY WITH THAT THING ON YOUR HEAD.
Jimmy: THIS IS A REAL -- A A TOUPEE. OH, THIS THING! [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A -- I'M SO SORRY. PAL, I LOVE YOU. WE'RE NEIGHBORS. I WANT YOU TO COME BY. I'M GOING TO COME AND STOP BY.
YES!
