WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE SHOW TO BE AT. WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT, OF COURSE, IT'S "THE OSCARS." DID YOU SEE "THE OSCARS" LAST NIGHT IT WAS -- [ CHEERS ] IT WAS A GREAT SHOW. I THOUGHT JIMMY KIMMEL DID A A GREAT JOB HOSTING. CONGRATS TO JIMMY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S ALWAYS GOOD. BUT DID YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END? [ LAUGHTER ] THE PRODUCERS OF "LA LA LAND" WENT UP ON STAGE AFTER THE MOVIE WAS NAMED BEST PICTURE. THEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ACTUALLY LOST TO "MOONLIGHT." [ AUDIENCE AWES ] YEAH, AND TODAY THEY JOINED A A SUPPORT GROUP WITH THE ATLANTA FALCONS AND HILLARY CLINTON. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY SUPPORT EACH OTHER.
Steve: YEAH, VERY SUPPORTIVE.
Jimmy: BUT IT REALLY WAS -- IT WAS A REALLY CRAZY MOMENT. IN FACT, "MOONLIGHT" DIRECTOR BARRY JENKINS SAID THAT HE WAS SPEECHLESS. NOT BECAUSE HE WAS SURPRISED, BECAUSE HE'D TORN UP HIS SPEECH WHEN "LA LA LAND" WAS ANNOUNCED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "WHAT? ME?" ACTUALLY SEVERAL PRODUCERS FROM "LA LA LAND" HAD ALREADY GIVEN THEIR ACCEPTANCE SPEECHES BEFORE THE MISTAKE WAS REALIZED. THAT'S PRETTY ROUGH. I MEAN, NOW YOU GOTTA APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE YOU FORGOT TO THANK IN YOUR SPEECH THAT DIDN'T COUNT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S JUST LIKE WHAT IS THIS --
Jimmy: THIS IS PRETTY COOL THOUGH, LAST NIGHT, SOUND MIXER, KEVIN O'CONNELL WON HIS FIRST OSCAR AFTER BEING NOMINATED 21 TIMES.

Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: REALISTIC. SCARY. SCARY. SCARED ME. GUYS, SOME NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON. ON FRIDAY CNN, THE NEW YORK TIMES AND BUZZFEED WERE BLOCKED FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE MEDIA BRIEFING WITH WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER. CNN CALLED IT, "UNACCEPTABLE." THE TIMES CALLED IT, "OUTRAGEOUS." AND BUZZFEED CALLED IT, "ONE OF THE TOP SEVEN THINGS TRUMP DID TODAY THAT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IN FACT, THINGS ARE SO TENSE BETWEEN TRUMP AND THE PRESS, HE SAYS HE'S NOT GOING TO THIS YEAR'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT'S DINNER. AN AIDE DEFENDED HIS DECISION SAYING QUOTE, "IF A GIRL SCOUT EGGED YOUR HOUSE, WOULD YOU BUY COOKIES FROM HER?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AN AMERICAN SAID, "IF SHE'S SELLING THIN MINTS, HELL YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SAMOAS. I'LL DO IT."
Steve: WHERE DO I SIGN?
Jimmy: THIS IS KIND OF EMBARRASSING. OVER THE WEEKEND, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE TWEETED HIS SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL, BUT ACCIDENTALLY USED THE EMOJI OF THE NICARAGUAN FLAG INSTEAD OF THE ISRAELI FLAG. [ LAUGHTER ] THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THERE'S A A PERFECTLY GOOD REASON WHY HE DID IT, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING. [ APPLAUSE ] AND THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO SAY. JUST SAY IT. JUST SAY IT. CHECK THIS OUT, GUYS. I READ THAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG WORKS OUT TWICE A WEEK WITH A A PERSONAL TRAINER AND BENCH PRESSES UP TO 70 POUNDS. [ SCATTERED CHEERS ] SHE ALSO DOES THAT REALLY ANNOYING THING WHERE SHE THROWS THE WEIGHT ON THE FLOOR TO LET THE ENTIRE GYM KNOW SHE'S FINISHED A SET. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: GUYS, GET THIS, I SAW THAT THE OXFORD DICTIONARY JUST ADDED OVER 300 WORDS, INCLUDING DRUNK TEXT, CAT LADY AND KODAK MOMENT. AS IN, "I DRUNK TEXTED A CAT LADY, WE MET UP, AND IT WAS NOT A KODAK MOMENT." [ APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, GUYS, SOME TV NEWS, IN A NEW PROMO FOR "THE BACHELOR," NICK ACTUALLY HINTS THAT HE MIGHT NOT HAND OUT A A FINAL ROSE TO ANY OF THE REMAINING WOMEN. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] YEAH, AFTER A WHOLE SEASON HE WON'T TAKE ANY OF THEM. CHECK OUT HOW "BACHELOR" FANS ARE REACTING TO THIS.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE SILLIEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD.
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
