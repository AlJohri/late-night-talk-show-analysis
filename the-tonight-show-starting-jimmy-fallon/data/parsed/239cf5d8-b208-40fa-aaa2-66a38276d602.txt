Questlove: 170!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOT CROWD. HOT CROWD HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WELL, EVERYONE IS ON EDGE IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI AFTER THE GRAND JURY DECISION LAST NIGHT. OF COURSE, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WENT ON THERE. BUT DON'T WORRY, YOUR FACEBOOK FRIENDS HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. YEAH. LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA ADDRESSED THE NATION, CALLED FOR CALM AND RESTRAINT IN THE WAKE OF THE FERGUSON GRAND JURY DECISION. THEN AMERICANS SAID, "WHEN HAVE WE EVER SHOWN CALM AND RESTRAINT? WE OVERTHREW THE ENGLISH BECAUSE THE TEA WAS TOO EXPENSIVE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE DON'T EVEN LIKE TEA. WE LIKE COFFEE. IT WASN'T ABOUT TEA. THIS IS NICE. SO, I SAW YESTERDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM TO MERYL STREEP, AND IT TURNS OUT HE'S GOT SOME VERY STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT HER.
I'VE SAID IT PUBLICALLY, I LOVE MERYL STREEP. I LOVE HER. HER HUSBAND KNOWS I LOVE HER. MICHELLE KNOWS I LOVE HER. THERE'S NOTHING EITHER OF THEM CAN DO ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PEOPLE DIDN'T LAUGH AS HARD WHEN BILL CLINTON SAID THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DIDN'T LAUGH AS HARD.
Steve: DIFFERENT THINGS. AFTER OBAMA SAID THAT, HE TOOK OFF HIS MASK AND WAS LIKE, "GOTCHA, I'M ACTUALLY MERYL STREEP." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, SHE'S THAT GOOD. SHE'S THAT GOOD OF AN ACTOR, FOLKS. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. SHE'S A CHAMELEON. SOME NEWS OUT OF ENGLAND. IT'S RUMORED THAT KATE MIDDLETON IS BUYING HER BROTHER-IN-LAW, PRINCE HARRY, A A YELLOW LABRADOR PUPPY FOR CHRISTMAS. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] WHEN ASKED WHEN THEY'LL GET HIM FIXED, THE ROYAL FAMILY SAID, "PROBABLY BEFORE HIS NEXT TRIP TO VEGAS -- OH, YOU MEAN THE PUPPY?" OH, YEAH. [ BRITISH ACCENT ] "PRINCE HARRY GO BACK TO YOUR QUARTERS. THE PUPPY, OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL GET RIGHT TO IT, YES." OF COURSE, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE HEADED TO THE MOVIES THIS WEEKEND. PROBABLY GOING TO GO SEE "THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY PART ONE." IT'S CURRENTLY THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW. [ CHEERS ] YEAH, "HUNGER GAMES." PEOPLE LOVE "THE HUNGER GAMES." GET THIS. NEW DATA SHOWS "THE HUNGER GAMES" MOVIES HAVE INSPIRED 29 COUPLES TO NAME THEIR DAUGHTERS KATNISS. AND KIDS WHO WERE BORN WHEN "THE HOBBIT" CAME OUT SAID, "WELL, YOU GOT OFF EASY." [ LAUGHTER ] "THIS IS MY DAUGHTER, BILBO. BILBO, SAY HI TO EVERYBODY." WE LOVE 'THE HOBBIT.' GO PLAY WITH YOUR BROTHER, JAR-JAR." [ LAUGHTER ] AND GET THIS, CHRISTIAN BALE JUST SAID THAT AT FIRST HE WAS JEALOUS BEN AFFLECK WAS CAST AS THE NEW BATMAN. BUT SINCE THEN, HE'S EMAILED BEN WITH SOME ADVICE FOR THE ROLE. HIS FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE, "DON'T DO THIS STUPID VOICE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT SOUNDS COOL AT FIRST, IT GETS OLD REALLY FAST." [ APPLAUSE ] GET THIS. IT'S SO COLD IN THE MIDWEST, YOU GUYS, THEY'RE SAYING PARTS OF MICHIGAN'S GREAT LAKES ARE ALREADY COVERED IN ICE, WHICH IS THE EARLIEST IT'S APPEARED IN 40 YEARS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT LAKES COULD STILL BE DANGEROUS, SO BE SURE TO SEND OUT THE KID YOU LIKE THE LEAST TO SKATE FIRST. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] REMEMBER THAT. "BILBO! GO ON OUT THERE, BILBO. GIVE IT A SHOT." "I DON'T WANT TO." "BILBO!" [ LAUGHTER ] I WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS!
Steve: R2! [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE DO THIS SORT OF THING, BUT I HEARD THAT THE MAYOR OF SEATTLE ACTUALLY PARDONED A TOFU TURKEY LAST WEEK. A TOFURKEY, WHICH WAS NICKNAMED BRAEBURN. YEAH. IT GOT EVEN WEIRDER WHEN HE SAID, "NOW, FLY AWAY." [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, IF YOU'RE GETTING TOGETHER WITH YOUR FAMILY THIS THANKSGIVING, YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS -- STARBUCKS ANNOUNCED THAT SOME OF THEIR STORES WILL REMAIN OPEN ON THANKSGIVING, BECAUSE "STARBUCKS STORES ARE A A GATHERING PLACE FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY."

IN FACT, WE GOT OUR HANDS ON THE LIST OF SO FAR WHICH MEMBERS OF THE STARBUCKS FAMILY ARE COMING TO THANKSGIVING AT STARBUCKS. OF COURSE, LET ME SHOW YOU -- THE BARISTA WITH THE STRETCHED EARLOBES. HE'S GONNA BE THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'LL BE THERE. YEAH, YEAH, HE'S COMING. HE RSVP'D. ALSO ATTENDING, THE WOMAN WHO PRETENDS SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT SHE'S CUTTING A LINE OF 15 PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] "WHAT? WHAT? I DIDN'T -- WHAT? I'M HERE. CAN I GET TWO LATTES AND A A COUPLE OF THOSE VITA PACKAGES?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, THERE'S A GUY WHO THINKS THE MORNING RUSH IS THE PERFECT TIME TO REFILL HIS STARBUCKS CARD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I GOTTA MAKE IT TO WORK TOO, GUYS. SHOULD I MAKE IT FOR $17.26 -- NO, 28, NO. $17.30 -- SORRY, EVERYBODY. $17 --" I'LL BUY THE GUY'S COFFEE, GET HIM OUT OF HERE. THIS MADE ME LAUGH. LAST NIGHT, CBS WAS TALKING ABOUT ODELL BECKHAM JR.'S CRAZY CATCH. YOU KNOW, THE ONE THE HANDED CATCH? IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE KNEW HIS NAME. ALTHOUGH, I'M NOT REALLY SURE THAT THEY KNEW HIS NAME. CHECK THIS OUT.
THIS IS THE CATCH THAT BROKE TWITTER, AM I RIGHT?

[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] PATTY LaBELLE DAVID BECKHAM JR. EVERYONE KNOWS YOUR NAME. YOU'RE LIKE THORM FROM "CHEERS", EVERYONE KNEW HIS NAME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, I THOUGHT THIS WAS NICE. I HEARD ABOUT A CHURCH IN CHICAGO THAT RECENTLY GAVE ITS REGULAR MEMBERS $500 EACH TO DO SOMETHING POSITIVE. THE CHURCHGOERS SAID IT WAS A A GREAT WAY TO DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY WHILE STILL HOLDING ON TO $495. [ APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, GUYS. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE!

Jimmy: WELCOME BACK.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME IN. I APPRECIATE IT.
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. CONGRATS ON THIS BOOK HERE.
THANKS.
Jimmy: I DO WANT TO TALK A A LITTLE ABOUT FERGUSON, IF WE COULD. YOU PROBABLY SPENT ALL DAY TALKING ABOUT IT.
YEAH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT'S A REALLY TERRIBLE STORY. WE'RE ALL AMERICANS. WE SHOULD ALL BE IN THIS TOGETHER. AND THESE KINDS OF STORIES DIVIDE US ALONG RACIAL LINES AND SOMETIMES IDEOLOGICAL LINES. TWO FACETS TO THIS STORY. THERE'S A FACTUAL PART OF IT AND AN EMOTIONAL PART OF IT. SO, YOU HAVE 12 AMERICANS ON THE GRAND JURY. AND THEY HEAR THE CASE FOR A A LONG TIME. AND THEY SEE THE FORENSIC EVIDENCE AND ALL THAT. AND THEY COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS A SELF-DEFENSE PLAY IN THE POLICE OFFICER SHOOTING MICHAEL BROWN. YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT IT. I MEAN, THAT'S OUR SYSTEM. YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT IT. MAYBE YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU DON'T AGREE WITH IT. BUT REMEMBER, THESE ARE 12 AMERICANS. THEY WERE PICKED OUT OF RANDOM -- THEY DON'T HAVE ANY AX TO GRIND. SO, THEY WENT IN. OKAY. THEN, YOU HAVE THE EMOTIONAL THING, WHERE AFRICAN-AMERICANS, SOME OF THEM, NOT ALL, FEEL THAT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM DOES NOT GIVE THEM A FAIR SHAKE. THAT'S A LEGITIMATE PROTEST.
Jimmy: SURE.
AND I RESPECT THAT. BECAUSE THINGS DON'T CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY UNLESS YOU PROTEST. THEY DON'T GET BETTER UNLESS YOU PROTEST. SO, WE WANT THAT.
Jimmy: THAT'S CALLED FREEDOM.
AND THAT MAKES AMERICA VIBRANT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING, PROTEST IT. DON'T BURN DOWN SOMEBODY'S STORE. SOMEBODY WHO'S WORKED THEIR WHOLE LIFE TO BUILD.
Jimmy: WHY WOULD THEY -- AND ALSO, I THOUGHT THE -- WHY WOULD YOU RELEASE THE JUDGMENT AT 8:00 P.M. AT NIGHTTIME?
YOU KNOW, THEY --
Jimmy: IF YOU'RE EXPECTING THERE MIGHT BE A RIOT.
RIGHT. THE PROSECUTOR WAS TRYING TO BASICALLY GET IN FRONT OF THE COUNTRY, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DO IT IN PRIMETIME. THAT'S WHY THAT HAPPENED. HE WANTED TO GET HIS CASE IN FRONT OF THE COUNTRY AND SAY, LOOK, WE DID ALL OF THIS, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A FAIR VERDICT. SO, YOU DO THAT IN PRIMETIME.
Jimmy: THAT'S CRAZY. IT'S JUST A CRAZY TIME. YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY POLITICAL ON YOUR SHOW, BUT DO YOU GET INTO POLITICAL CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR FAMILY ON THANKSGIVING?
NO, THAT'S NOT ALLOWED.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT ALLOWED, NO. YOU'RE VERY SMART.
YEAH, BECAUSE I CAN'T BE GOING, THIS IS THE NO SPIN ZONE, PASS THE GRAVY! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YELLING AT YOUR FAMILY.
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE YOUR FINGER ON THINGS AT THANKSGIVING.
Jimmy: YOU NEED TO DO THAT, YEAH.
THANKSGIVING AT MY HOUSE IS TRADITIONAL. IT'S PROBABLY LIKE THE FALLON HOUSE. THE IRISH PEOPLE LIKE THE TRADITIONS. AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN LEVITOWN THAT IT WAS A BIG DAY BECAUSE WE HAD TURKEY, AND WE HAD GRAVY AND MASHED POTATOES AND EVERYTHING. WE'RE USED TO EATING SPAGHETTI-Os AND FISH STICKS, OKAY? SO, TURKEY WAS LIKE A BIG UPGRADE.
Jimmy: OH, ABSOLUTELY.
I REMEMBER ONE TIME I ASKED MY FATHER. I SAID, "EXACTLY WHAT FISH IS THIS FISH STICK FROM?" AND THREE MONTHS LATER WHEN I GOT OUT OF MY ROOM.
Jimmy: HE'S LIKE, GET OUT OF HERE. YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE ANYTHING.
SO, WE WERE GRATEFUL TO HAVE THIS NICE MEAL. KIDS TODAY, "WHAT IS THIS? WHAT KIND OF STUFFING IS THIS?" THIS IS TRUE.
Jimmy: YEAH, I DID THAT, TOO.
ARE WE HAVING -- [ LAUGHTER ] ARE WE HAVING STRING BEANS? I SAID, YES. ARE THEY AMANDINE? THIS IS A KID! AMANDINE? I'LL GIVE YOU AN AMANDINE. THAT'S WHEN MY FINGER COMES OUT.
Jimmy: I REMEMBER WE HAD A A BIG DEBATE ON WHAT CRANBERRY SAUCE WE WANT. I DON'T LIKE THE REAL ONE. I LIKE THE ONE IN THE CAN.
THEY DON'T LIKE ANYTHING.
Jimmy: NO, WE DON'T LIKE ANYTHING, YEAH, YEAH.
"WHAT'S THIS STUFFING? WHAT KIND OF STUFFING IS THIS?" JUST EAT THE TURKEY!
Jimmy: MY GOSH.
JUST EAT IT.
Jimmy: I WANT TO KNOW, I KNOW YOU'RE CURRENTLY ON TOUR, YOU DID A COUPLE OF DAYS OF DENNIS MILLER?
YEAH, MILLER FOLLOWS ME AROUND, DENNIS MILLER. HE USED TO BE ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." HE DID YOUR JOB. YOU DID HIS JOB.
Jimmy: OH, HE'S FANTASTIC.
SO, WE DO A SHOW CALLED "THE BOULDER FRESHER" TOUR, WHICH WE'RE REBRANDING FOR 2 2015 THE "DON'T BE A PINHEAD" TOUR. AND TWO WEEKS AGO, WE'RE IN -- THIS IS AMAZING. WE WERE IN CAESAR'S PALACE, LAS VEGAS. SOLD IT OUT.
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU GET ON THE COMEDY CIRCUIT?
HE DOES STAND-UP. HE OPENS, HE COMES OUT, HE DOES 35 AND IT'S KILLER. YOU KNOW, MILLER IS GREAT. AND THEN I COME OUT AND I PRETTY MUCH TELL YOU WHAT GOES ON BEHIND THE SCENES. FOR EXAMPLE, I INTERVIEWED PRESIDENT OBAMA THREE TIMES. BUT WHEN THE CAMERA IS OFF, WHAT DO WE TALK ABOUT? THAT STUFF. I DON'T SAY THAT ON TV. BUT I TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, THAT WE HAVE AN ARM WRESTLING. I GIVE YOU THE INSIDE STUFF. I TELL YOU WHY MITT ROMNEY REALLY LOST, THAT KIND OF STUFF. SO, PEOPLE ENJOY IT. THEN, WE TAKE AN INTERMISSION. WE COME BACK AND WE DO CARDS FROM THE AUDIENCE. THEY WRITE DOWN QUESTIONS AND IT'S TOTALLY IMPROMPTU. THAT'S WILD. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE AT LEAST TWO BOUNCERS TO HANDLE MILLER. MILLER IS LIKE THIS.
Jimmy: LET ME JUST TELL YOU, HE WILL JUST GO OFF.
HE MAKES EDGAR ALLEN POE LOOK LIKE SISTER TERESA. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HE'S VERY FUNNY AND VERY GOOD SHOW.
Jimmy: HE'S A QUICK GUY.
YOU DO AN IMITATION OF MILLER.
Jimmy: I DO A IMITATION OF DENNIS MILLER. IT'S MORE LIKE, "I HAVEN'T HEARD THIS MUCH SILENCE SINCE I SAW A CHUCK CHAPLIN FILM." THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. THERE YOU GO. I'VE GOT TO WORK ON IT. I HAVEN'T DONE IT IN A WHILE. [ APPLAUSE ] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOOK HERE, "KILLING PATTON." CONGRATULATIONS, A NUMBER ONE.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT PATTON, EXCEPT THAT HE WAS -- IT WAS GEORGE C. SCOTT WHO PLAYED HIM IN THE MOVIE.
PEOPLE THINK THAT GEORGE C. WAS PATTON. GREAT PERFORMANCE, 45 YEARS AGO. THE REASON I WROTE THIS BOOK IS BECAUSE WE NEED LEADERSHIP IN AMERICA. AND THIS GUY WAS A LEADER. LIKE HIM OR NOT, HE WAS A TOUGH GUY. HE WAS A LEADER. HE WAS THE MOST FEARED AMERICAN GENERAL. THE NAZIS ACTUALLY -- THEY MOVED THEIR CAMPAIGNS AWAY FROM HIM. HE BEAT ROMMEL. AND HE WAS A GUY WHO JUST TOLD IT LIKE IT WAS. AND AFTER WORLD WAR II ENDED, HE WANTED TO FIGHT THE RUSSIANS. BECAUSE HE THOUGHT STALIN WAS JUST AS BAD AS HITLER. AND HE TOLD FDR AND IKE AND ALL THE GUYS, WE NEED TO GET THESE RUSSIANS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO CAUSE TROUBLE. NO, NO, NO, BECAUSE REMEMBER, RUSSIA WAS AMERICA'S ALLY AGAINST HITLER. SO, THEY DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE. BUT PATTON WAS GOING TO COME BACK TO THE UNITED STATES AND DO A TOUR, A NATIONWIDE TOUR, AND HE WAS THINKING ABOUT MAYBE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. ON THE SOVIETS ARE BAD, WE NEED TO GET THEM NOW WHILE THEY'RE IN A WEAKENED STATE AND WHILE WE HAVE OUR TROOPS IN EUROPE. OKAY? SO, THE DAY BEFORE PATTON WAS SUPPOSED TO COME BACK TO DO THAT TOUR, HE GETS SMASHED BY AN ARMY TRUCK ON A CLEAR LANE ON A CLEAR DAY. AND HE'S PARALYZED AND HE GOES TO THE HOSPITAL AND A COUPLE DAYS LATER HE DIES. ALL THE PAPERWORK OF THE ACCIDENT DISAPPEARS. ALL THE MEDICAL PAPERWORK DISAPPEARS. NO AUTOPSY. THEY GET HIM IN THE GROUND AS FAST AS THEY COULD GET HIM IN THE GROUND.
Jimmy: REALLY?
IT IS SO STRANGE.
Jimmy: MAYBE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN --
I'LL TELL YOU MY THEORY IN A A MINUTE. BUT WE PRESENT THE FACTS TO THE READER. YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND ON IT. WHAT I BELIEVE IS THAT STALIN GOT HIM. STALIN WAS TRACKING HIM. HE HAD TWO PRIOR ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS, PATTON HAD ON HIM. AND STALIN HAD HIS NKBD WHICH HIS SUPER SPY AGENCY, WHICH WORKED WITH THE AMERICANS, AND THEY WERE TRACKING PATTON. AND I THINK HE GOT HIM WITH AN ODORLESS POISON. I THINK THAT WHOLE ACCIDENT WAS CONTRIVED. WE PRESENT VERY POWERFUL EVIDENCE. AND YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A A CONSPIRATORIALIST. "KILLING KENEDY" -- I DEBUNKED ALL OF THOSE CONSPIRICES IN THAT BOOK. SO, MARTIN DUGARD AND I WE'RE NOT CRAZY KIND GUYS COMING FROM OUTER SPACE. WE HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION. SO, IT'S A VERY INTERESTING READ. SOLD ABOUT A MILLION COPIES IN SEVEN WEEKS. IT'S PHENOMENAL.
Jimmy: BUT MAYBE ALIENS WERE INVOLVED.
ALIENS?
Jimmy: YOU NEVER KNOW. YOU NEVER KNOW. THIS GUY WAS JUST A TOUGH, TOUGH HUMAN BEING.
OH, HE WAS TOUGH AS THEY COME.
Jimmy: I MEAN THIS QUOTE HERE, JUST THE --
THE OPENING QUOTE?
Jimmy: THE OPENING QUOTE.
THERE IT IS.
Jimmy: "WE'LL WIN THIS WAR, BUT WE'LL WIN IT ONLY BY FIGHTING AND SHOWING THE GERMANS THAT WE HAVE MORE GUTS THAN THEY HAVE, OR EVER WILL HAVE. WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO SHOOT THE SONS OF BITCHES, WE'RE GONNA RIP OUT THEIR LIVING DAMN GUTS AND USE THEM TO GREASE THE TREADS OUR TANKS." [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD NOT GO TO THANKSGIVING AT HIS HOUSE. NO, THAT'S COOL. I'M GONNA JUST EAT THE STUFFING. I'VE GOT SPAGHETTI-Os AT MY HOUSE. HAVE A GREAT THANKSGIVING.

Jimmy: CONGRATS ON EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU.
IT'S BEEN A SECOND.
Jimmy: YEAH. I MEAN, COME ON. IT'S BEEN A WHILE. DO I CALL YOU LORDE? OR DO I --
ELLA IS GOOD.
Jimmy: ELLA?
YEAH.
Jimmy: OKAY, YEAH. OKAY. [ WOMAN SCREAMS ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU. SORRY, MY MOM CAME TO THE SHOW. SHE'S JUST A BIG FAN.
I THINK THAT WAS MY MUM.
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE NAME, THE STAGE NAME LORDE?
WELL, I KIND OF WANTED SOMETHING THAT WAS LIKE ARISTOCRATIC AND FANCY AND SO I FOUND THE NAME, YOU KNOW, LORD, L-O-R-D. BUT I KIND OF WANTED TO FEMINIZE IT.
Jimmy: SO YOU ADD THE "E" ON THE END.
MAKE UP A WORD.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND DOES YOUR FAMILY CALL YOU LORDE, OR NO?
ARE YOU SERIOUS? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, YEAH, NO. THEY DON'T.
THEY CALL ME ELLA, YEAH.
Jimmy: THEY CALL YOU ELLA, YEAH. YEAH.
BUT NO, IT'S WEIRD. MY LITTLE BROTHER -- WELL LIKE MY FRIENDS HAVE KIND OF FOUND OUT THAT THE THING TO DO TO EMBARRASS ME, WHEN WE'RE IN A PUBLIC PLACE IS TO GO, "IS THAT LORDE?" AND IT SPREADS, AND I'M LIKE --
Jimmy: AT A MALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YEAH.
DON'T DO IT, DON'T DO IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AT THE SUPERMARKET. LIKE, SO BAD.
Jimmy: WHEN YOU FIRST -- BECAUSE WHEN WE FIRST SAW YOU ON OUR SHOW, YOU SANG "ROYALS."
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THAT WAS A A SONG --
THAT WAS MY FIRST TV HERE.
Jimmy: I KNOW. I'M SO PROUD AND SO HAPPY. YEAH. IT'S GREAT. YOU'RE LORDE, YEAH. BUT YOU SANG THIS "ROYALS," AND WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT, PEOPLE SAID, "NO GOOD, IT WAS NOT GOOD FOR RADIO. WE DON'T WANT THIS." YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.
YEAH, WELL THEY WERE LIKE, "WE HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO FIT ANYWHERE." I WAS LIKE, "AW, OKAY."
Jimmy: BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO DIFFERENT.
YEAH. I MEAN, THEY WERE LIKE, "WE'RE GOING TO ADD MORE STUFF TO IT." AND I WAS LIKE, NO, NO, NO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO ADD ANYMORE.
Jimmy: AND SO HOW DID YOU GET IT OUT? LIKE HOW DID YOU PUT IT ON LIKE --
IT WAS LIKE --
Jimmy: TUMBLR OR LIKE A A BLOG?
I JUST, I PUT IT ON SOUNDCLOUD. I WAS LIKE IT, "DOES THIS MATTER?" I MEAN LIKE, I LIKE IT. I'M PROUD OF IT. MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WILL LIKE IT. AND IT KIND OF --
Jimmy: UNTOUCHED, DIDN'T ADD ANYTHING TO IT. JUST THAT. THAT'S THE ONE THAT WENT OUT AND GOT VIRAL.
IT'S LITERALLY THE DEMO. ALL THAT INSTRUMENTATION WAS THE DEMO INSTRUMENTATION.
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC. AND LOOK AT YOU NOW. YOU WON TWO GRAMMYS. I MEAN THIS IS -- THAT WAS AMAZING.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THAT WAS SO FUN. WERE YOU FREAKING OUT? WERE YOU EXCITED?
THE GRAMMYS. IT WAS TERRIFYING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: REALLY? NO, YEAH. IT'S MORE LIKE SCARY.
BECAUSE I HAD NEVER DONE IT BEFORE. IT'S SO SCARY TO KIND OF JUST -- I MEAN THAT WAS LIKE MY FIRST, LIKE ENCOUNTER WITH PEOPLE THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN EXCEPT FOR ON THE TV.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU'RE LIKE, "AH, BEYONCE." LIKE, WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE THAT FAMOUS, YOU DO THIS THING -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU GO TO PERFORM AND YOU SEE SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE, LIKE, THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND YOU JUST --
Jimmy: IT'S HAPPENING NOW. YEAH. IT'S HAPPENING NOW. UH, YEAH -- AND YOU'RE LIKE PALS WITH TAYLOR SWIFT NOW, RIGHT? BECAUSE I KNOW YOU AND TAYLOR WERE LIKE -- YOU MET AT A ONE OF THESE, A A COUPLE OF THESE AWARD SHOWS. AND YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE TOGETHER.
YEAH. WE ACTUALLY MET -- SHE SENT ME SOME FLOWERS, WHICH WAS SO NICE. SHE JUST SENT THEM TO MY HOUSE AND SAID LIKE, "CONGRATULATIONS ON EVERYTHING." AND I WAS LIKE, "GOD!"
Jimmy: SHE'S REALLY COOL. AND REALLY FUNNY, TOO.
AND I WAS LIKE, I NEED TO KNOW MORE. YEAH. AND SO WE ACTUALLY MET UP HERE IN NEW YORK. NOT HERE ON THIS COUCH. AT SHAKE SHACK, WHICH I FEEL LIKE IS A KIND OF A GOOD LIKE, BONDING --
Jimmy: SHAKE SHACK'S THE BEST. YEAH. WE LOVE THOSE HAMBURGERS.
THOSE LIKE, THICK-ASS MILKSHAKES.
Jimmy: SHE'S VERY, VERY -- OH, THE GREATEST MILKSHAKES.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT SHE CAME ON THE SHOW AND SHE DID BITS AND SHE'S LIKE ONE OF THE MOST FUNNIEST -- SHE'S ACTUALLY REALLY, REALLY FUNNY, TAYLOR SWIFT.
SHE'S REALLY FUNNY AND PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT IT. IT'S REALLY DRY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND YOU'RE ALMOST LIKE -- YOU'RE LIKE, "WAIT, DID I -- IS THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID?"
Jimmy: YEAH. SHE PRETENDED TO BE YOUR MANAGER?
OH, GOD.
Jimmy: -- OR SHE PRETENDED THAT YOU WERE HER MANAGER?
SO WE WERE AT THIS GRAMMY PARTY. AND IT WAS, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, ONE OF MY FIRSTS. LIKE THIS WAS BEFORE THE GRAMMYS. AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, THERE ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE EVERYWHERE."
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S LIKE THIS PERSON, IT'S INSANE. AND I SORT OF, YOU KNOW, FOUND HER AND KIND OF CLUNG TO HER. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE COME UP TO TAYLOR, YOU KNOW. JUST TO TALK ABOUT STUFF. AND SHE'S LOVELY. SHE'S GREAT. AND THERE WAS THIS GUY, AND HE WANTED HER TO PLAY SOME EVENT THAT HE WAS HAVING. AND HE WAS, YOU KNOW, HE TALKED TO US FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. AND SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY LOVELY ABOUT IT. AND THEN IT KIND OF GOT TO THE END OF THE CONVERSATION AND HE SAID, "SO, I'LL LEAVE MY CARD, IS THIS YOUR MANAGER?" AND HE POINTS AT ME. AND JUST -- NO BEAT PASSED AND SHE'S LIKE, "YES."
Jimmy: JUST REALLY QUICK. OH, YEAH. THAT'S MY MANAGER, YEAH.
AND THEN I WAS, I WAS TAYLOR SWIFT'S MANAGER. THIS LIKE, TINY, KIND OF GOTHY, LIKE HUNCHED PERSON. [ GROANS ] AND THE WORST PART IS --
Jimmy: HOW HAVE THINGS BEEN? YEAH.
AND I PERFORMED THAT NIGHT. ON THAT STAGE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR LATER.
Jimmy: SO THAT GUY MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE, "HER MANAGER IS REALLY TALENTED. I MEAN, THAT'S AMAZING."
IT WAS GREAT.
Jimmy: AND THEN YOU GET APPROCHED TO DO SOMETHING AS BIG AS THIS. I MEAN, THIS IS A GIANT JOB HERE.
IT'S PRETTY BIG, RIGHT?
Jimmy: YOU HAD TO PUT ALL OF THESE, ALL OF ARTISTS TOGETHER, FOR THIS SOUNDTRACK. THAT'S A LOT TO ASK.
IT'S A LOT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT WAS A WHOLE LOT. ESPECIALLY, BECAUSE, A -- I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S ALWAYS USUALLY THE BEST WAY TO DO IT.
WELL, YEAH. AND I WAS JUST LIKE, YEAH, LIKE, I CAN DO THIS. AND THEN REALIZED, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS AT ALL. AND I DID IT.
Jimmy: YOU HAD TO CALL ALL THE ARTISTS UP?
CALL, TEXT, EMAIL.
Jimmy: REALLY? AND YOU PUT IT TOGETHER. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE?
I THINK IT TOOK TWO AND A A HALF MONTHS. WHICH IS LIKE, KIND OF ABNORMALLY SHORT.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S NOT THAT LONG OF A TIME. ABSOLUTELY. YEAH.
AND I WAS ON THE ROAD, ON THE TOUR BUS. AND I WOULD LITERALLY RUN OFF STAGE, LIKE IN MY OUTFIT. STILL KIND OF, STRIP IT OFF AND GET INTO MY BED ON THE TOUR BUS AND JUST START WORK FOR THE DAY ON THE SONGS.
Jimmy: GEEZ, YOU HAD TO WEAR TWO HATS, MAN. AND WHAT SONG ARE YOU GOING TO PERFORM TONIGHT?
I'M GOING TO PERFORM MY SONG, WHICH YOU HEAR AT THE END OF THE FILM. IT'S CALLED "YELLOW FLICKER BEAT."
Jimmy: "YELLOW FLICKER BEAT." I'M SO PSYCHED FOR YOU. THANKS SO MUCH. CONGRATULATIONS FOR EVERYTHING.
