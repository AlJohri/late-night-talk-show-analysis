Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- MATT LAUER, GISELE BUNDCHEN, MUSICAL GUEST, FITZ AND THE TANTRUMS, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 459! WOO!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HOW YOU DOING? OH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT RIGHT THERE. THAT'S A HOT CROWD. GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." WELCOME, THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE, YOU MADE IT. I'M SO HAPPY, THIS IS GREAT. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, EVERYBODY. OF COURSE, YESTERDAY WAS A HUGE WIN FOR DONALD TRUMP, WHO WON ALL FIVE OF THE PRIMARIES IN THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT, DELAWARE, MARYLAND, PENNSYLVANIA, AND RHODE ISLAND. YEP, DURING HIS VICTORY SPEECH, TRUMP CALLED IT A DIVERSE VICTORY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S TRUE. SOME PEOPLE IN THOSE STATES SHOP AT J. CREW AND OTHERS SHOP AT J. CREW OUTLET. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO, I MEAN, IT'S --
Steve: VERY DIVERSE.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE --
Steve: WHERE DO THEY SHOP?
Jimmy: YOU DON'T KNOW.
Steve: OUTLET.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, TRUMP HAD A GREAT DAY YESTERDAY, SWEEPING ALL FIVE STATE PRIMARIES. AFTERWARDS, HE SAID, "USUALLY, MY MAID DOES ALL THE SWEEPING, BUT TONIGHT, IT WAS ALL ME. I'LL TAKE CREDIT FOR THE SWEEPING EVERYTHING." [ APPLAUSE ] HILLARY CLINTON ALSO HAD A A PRETTY GOOD NIGHT. BUT SO FAR, BERNIE IS REFUSING TO DROP OUT. IT'S REALLY TENSE. IT'S TENSE BETWEEN THEM. AND IT'S SO TENSE, THAT ONE TOP DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST SAID THAT THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN EASE TENSIONS BETWEEN HILLARY AND BERNIE SANDERS IS JOE BIDEN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OR AS JOE BIDEN PUT IT, "LOOKS LIKE IT'S TIME FOR A DOUBLE MASSAGE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Steve: BIDEN TIME.
Jimmy: THIS IS PRETTY BIG. TODAY, CARLY FIORINA WAS ANNOUNCED AS TED CRUZ'S RUNNING MATE. FIORINA SAYS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HER LIFELONG DREAM TO LOSE TWICE IN THE SAME ELECTION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND THAT'S NICE THAT WE CAN GIVE -- WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR HER. SHE'S NOT THE ONLY FORMER CANDIDATE KEEPING BUSY. I READ THAT MARTIN O'MALLEY AND MIKE HUCKABEE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE STARTING A BIPARTISAN ROCK BAND TOGETHER. [ LAUGHTER ] THE BAND HAS A GREAT WAY TO MAKE MONEY. THE CONCERTS ARE FREE, BUT EAR PLUGS COST $200. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Steve: BIPARTNERSHIP.
Jimmy: HEY. THAT WASN'T HALF BAD. I LIKE THAT. I WOULD GO SEE THAT BAND. DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? POPE FRANCIS TOLD THOUSANDS OF TEENAGERS AT MASS RECENTLY THAT HAPPINESS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FROM AN APP. THAT STORY AGAIN, POPE FRANCIS HAS NEVER SEEN SNAPCHAT FILTERS.

Jimmy: HERE'S A LITTLE TECH NEWS, HERE. I SAW THAT TESLA IS GIVING ITS CURRENT CAR OWNERS A ONE-MONTH FREE TRIAL OF ITS AUTOPILOT SELF-DRIVING MODE. WHICH MEANS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR A TESLA THE MOMENT THAT OFFER EXPIRES. IT'S LIKE, "SO ANYWAY, I WAS TALKING TO A GUY -- OH, MY GOODNESS! [ APPLAUSE ] DIDN'T PAY MY BILL!" THIS IS INTERESTING, HERE. SCIENTISTS CLAIM TO HAVE USED GENE THERAPY TO ACTUALLY REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF AGING. YEAH. SUCH AS A SHORTENING OF TELOMERASE THAT CAN CAUSE AGE RELATED ILLNESS LIKE BRITTLE BONES AND HEART DISEASE. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. THEY SAY GENE THERAPY CAN REVERSE OTHER EFFECTS OF AGING, SUCH AS REFERRING TO AN ACTOR AS "THAT GUY FROM THAT THING." [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY, NOW.
Jimmy: NO, HE WAS THAT MURDERER IN THAT THING.
Steve: NO, NOT THAT THING. THAT THING. YOU NEVER EVEN SAW THAT THING.

AND GET THIS, A NEW STUDY FOUND OUT THE AVERAGE WHISKEY DRINKER IN AMERICA CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOURBON AND RYE. OF COURSE, MOST OF THEM ALSO CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GIRL AND A COAT RACK. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S LIKE -- HELLO, HOW ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S A PRETTY ADORABLE TRENCH. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS A PRETTY CRAZY STORY OUT OF TEXAS. POLICE OFFICERS IN HOUSTON RECENTLY FOUND A TIGER WANDERING THE STREETS WEARING A A COLLAR AND A LEASH, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO LOCATE THE OWNER. I HATE TO BE THE ONE TO SAY THIS, BUT HAVE THEY CHECKED INSIDE THE TIGER? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'LL SEE AN X-RAY. THE GUY'S LIKE -- AND FINALLY, A LITTLE LOCAL NEWS. APPARENTLY, A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO THOUGHT SHE WAS RUNNING A A 5K FUN RUN ENDED UP RUNNING A A HALF MARATHON WHEN HER MOM DROPPED HER OFF AT THE WRONG PLACE.

Jimmy: DO YOU HAVE FUN AT THE OLYMPICS? BECAUSE EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN THERE YOU HAVE TO GET UP AT LIKE 2:00 IN THE MORNING. YOU WAKE UP.
WELL, NO, BUT SO RIO'S CLOSER TO THE TIME. I THINK IT'S ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO AHEAD OF US. SO, IT'S GOOD. IT'S LIKE NORMAL TIME. WE LITERALLY PASS EACH OTHER IN THE COMMISSARY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. BUT THE OLYMPICS ARE SO INSPIRING, THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW HARD THEY ARE, WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO INTERVIEW ATHLETES WHO HAVE JUST EITHER ACCOMPLISHED THE GREATEST THING IN THEIR LIVES OR HAVE MAYBE JUST FALLEN A LITTLE BIT SHORT, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. IT'S A GREAT HONOR. REALLY IS.
Jimmy: WELL, YOU'RE THE BEST FOR DOING THIS. I THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK IN RIO. MATT LAUER. WATCH HIM ON THE "TODAY" SHOW. HE'S CRUSHING IT EVERY MORNING RIGHT HERE ON NBC. WE'LL BE BACK WITH GISELE BUNDCHEN, EVERYBODY, STICK AROUND. ♪♪

Jimmy: GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE BOOK.
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING SOME EXERCISES? CAUSE LAST TIME, REMEMBER I TRIED TO TEACH YOU THE PLANK? SO THIS TIME, JUST KEEPING YOU FIT. JUST THINKING OF YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S TOO HEAVY. IT'S TOO HEAVY.
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS FIT.
Jimmy: BUT, I'M SO HAPPY I OWN THIS THING. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE DONE ALL THIS WORK? I MEAN, IS IT KIND OF FUN TO LOOK AT?
NOW I CAN. BECAUSE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, USUALLY LIKE I KIND OF JUST LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT'S THE NEXT THING, WHAT'S THE NEXT THING. SO, IT WAS A FUN PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO STOP AND LOOK BACK, GO BACK 20 YEARS. JUST, YOU KNOW, JUST FEELING VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE. THAT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE ALL THOSE DIFFERENT MOMENTS.
Jimmy: THEY'RE UNBELIEVABLE, PHOTOS. DO YOU REMEMBER THE PHOTOGRAPHERS AND STORIES BEHIND ALL THE SHOTS?
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU DO?
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE WATCHING -- IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A THERAPY I HAVE TO SAY. BECAUSE GOING THROUGH EACH PICTURE, I REMEMBER FEELING EVERY EMOTION. IT'S KIND OF FUNNY HOW, HOW THAT HAPPENS, YOU KNOW, I FELT LIKE I WAS RELIVING ALL OF THOSE MOMENTS AGAIN. SO IT WAS A REALLY COOL, IT WAS A NEAT EXPERIENCE.
Jimmy: I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MODELS DO IT. BECAUSE, I'VE TAKEN PHOTOS JUST TO PROMOTE OUR SHOW AND STUFF LIKE THAT. THEY'VE TAKEN A PHOTO AND I JUST KIND OF END UP LIKE POSING, YOU KNOW? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEY GO, STOP POSING. I GO, I KNOW, BUT I'VE SEEN WHAT IT'S GOING TO END UP LOOKING LIKE. SO YOU KIND OF WANT LIKE -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY GO, STOP POSING. AND I GO, YEAH.

Jimmy: 14 YEARS OLD HERE, LOOK AT THIS.
THEY PUT MASCARA. AND I THOUGHT I HAD SO MUCH MAKEUP ON. THEY PUT MASCARA IN THE GLASSES, GOD I LOOK LIKE, I HAVE A LOT OF MAKEUP ON. WHAT'S GOING ON?
Jimmy: YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS A LOT OF MAKEUP?
I DID. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS COMING. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS AHEAD.
Jimmy: WHERE DID THIS HAPPEN? DID YOUR MOM GET YOU INTO IT?
NO, WHAT HAPPENED, I WAS ACTUALLY ON AN EXCURSION, BECAUSE MY MOM WAS ALWAYS COMPLAINING THAT, YOU KNOW, I'M 5'11." I WAS LIKE BASICALLY 5'10" AT 14. AND SHE WAS ALWAYS, GISELLE, STAND UP STRAIGHT. LIKE, YOU KNOW, I'M ALWAYS LIKE THIS, LIKE HIDING. SO WE WENT TO THIS MODELING COURSE. THERE WAS LIKE 50 GIRLS. WE WENT TO AN EXCURSION, AND THERE'S ALL OF US. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO MISS 50 GIRLS IN A MALL. RIGHT? WE'RE ALL WEARING THE SAME OUTFIT, LIKE YOU KNOW, THIS BLACK UNIFORM.
Jimmy: SHE THOUGHT MODELING WOULD HELP YOUR POSTURE?
YEAH, SHE THOUGHT, YEAH BECAUSE, AND IT KIND OF -- I MEAN, MAYBE IT DIDN'T DO THAT MUCH.

Jimmy: STRANGER!

Jimmy: STRANGER DANGER! STRANGER DANGER!
STRANGER DANGER. AND MY MOM WAS LIKE. MY MOM SAID NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS. SO HE SAID, YOU KNOW, LET'S GO TO THE AGENCY BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR DAUGHTER, YOU KNOW, SHE HAS THE PHYSIQUE TO BE A MODEL. AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE WERE GOING TO GO TO THE PLAY CENTER AT THE END OF THE DAY, AFTER THE MALL.
Jimmy: WHAT IS THE PLAY CENTER?
PLAY CENTER IS LIKE SIX FLAGS.
Jimmy: OH.
SO YOU IMAGINE, I WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
Jimmy: THE CHOICE BETWEEN THAT OR MODELING?
CAN YOU IMAGINE? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MODEL. I WOULD HAVE BEEN EATING A CORN DOG. LET'S DO IT AGAIN, ONE MORE TIME.
THAT WAS KIND OF WHAT I WAS THINKING. BUT THERE WAS THIS OTHER GIRL WHO WAS GOING, HE ACTUALLY SELECTED TWO GIRLS TO GO TO THE AGENCY. AND SHE WAS GOING, AND EVERYBODY WAS LIKE, YOU SHOULD GO WITH HER. I'M LIKE, BUT I WANT TO GO TO PLAY CENTER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THEY WERE LIKE, WELL WHATEVER. THEN I WENT AND HERE I AM 20 YEARS LATER. HERE I AM.
