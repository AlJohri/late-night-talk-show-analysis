Jimmy: HOT, HOT, HOT CROWD TONIGHT! OH, MY GOSH. WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HOT SHOW TONIGHT.
Steve: HOT.
Jimmy: I'M TALKING ABOUT JENNIFER ANISTON TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TALKING ABOUT BILL GATES TONIGHT.
Steve: WHOA! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: TALKING ABOUT MARIO BATALI TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY-OH!
Jimmy: BUT FIRST OFF, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE ALL TALKING ABOUT HERE. THIS IS -- OF COURSE, LAST NIGHT WAS THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. DID YOU GUYS SEE IT? [ CHEERS ] WELL, EVERYONE'S REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS HUGE SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY A GUY THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN A REALLY LONG TIME -- 2008 BARACK OBAMA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SWAGGER. HE'S VERY CONFIDENT. DID YOU SEE THIS THOUGH? AFTER REPUBLICANS IN THE CROWD APPLAUDED WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT HE HAD NO MORE CAMPAIGNS TO RUN, HE QUICKLY ADDED, QUOTE, "WELL, I KNOW, BECAUSE I WON BOTH OF THEM." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHOA. Steve: SNAP. Jimmy: I'M NOT SAYING OBAMA WAS THROWING SHADE, BUT THAT INSULT JUST SOLVED GLOBAL WARMING. [ LAUGHTER ] I WISH HE'D DONE IT EARLIER. AND DURING HIS SPEECH, PRESIDENT OBAMA ALSO DISCUSSED THE ECONOMIC TURNAROUND AND CREDITED MUCH OF IT TO IMPROVEMENTS IN ROBOTICS. WHICH WERE ACTUALLY ON DISPLAY LATER WHEN JONI ERNST GAVE THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE. [ LAUGHTER ]
WE'LL EXPAND SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT THE KIND OF CYBER-ATTACKS WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY. WE'LL WORK TO CONFRONT IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "MY NAME IS JONI ERNST. MY NAME IS JONI ERNST. ERROR. ERROR. ERROR. ERROR. ERROR. ERROR. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK TO A A REPRESENTATIVE?" [ LAUGHTER ] THE PRESIDENT ALSO TOOK A A MOMENT TO WISH ASTRONAUT SCOTT KELLY LUCK ON HIS UPCOMING YEAR-LONG MISSION IN SPACE, AND EVEN SAID, "MAKE SURE TO INSTAGRAM IT." IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR FRIENDS WERE ANNOYING ABOUT POSTING SUNRISES, WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE GUY WHO'S ORBITING THE EARTH EVERY TWO HOURS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LIKE, "THERE SHE IS AGAIN. BEAUTIFUL." THAT'S RIGHT. OBAMA LOVES INSTAGRAM. BECAUSE AFTER SIX YEARS WITH BIDEN, IT'S THE ONE THING HE CAN STILL PUT A FILTER ON. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, HE'S VERY HAPPY WITH IT. NO, WE LOVE JOE BIDEN. WE LOVE HIM. OF COURSE, SINCE HE'S THE VICE PRESIDENT HE WAS ALSO INTERVIEWED AFTER THE SPEECH. BUT I THINK HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT. HAVING BEEN A RECEIVER, I -- I LIKE A SOFTER BALL. THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: AWFUL!
Jimmy: FORGET IT.
Steve: HEY! STOP! DON'T EVEN.

Jimmy: UM -- AND I SAW THIS HERE. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY ANTHONY FOX WAS DESIGNATED AS THE ONE CABINET MEMBER ASKED TO STAY BEHIND AND RUN THE GOVERNMENT IN CASE THERE'S SOME KIND OF CRISIS AT THE CAPITAL. AND BECAUSE ALSO TIME-WARNER WAS SUPPOSED TO COME FIX THE CABLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 8:00 AND 11:00 AND SOMEONE HAS TO BE THERE. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW THAT. THAT'S THE RULE. THAT'S RIGHT. ANTHONY FOX HAD TO STAY BEHIND, BUT LUCKILY THE PERSON WHO HAD TO DO IT LAST YEAR, ENERGY SECRETARY ERNEST MONIZ, DID GET TO ATTEND. AND YOU COULD TELL HE WAS PRETTY HAPPY TO BE THERE. CHECK OUT ERNEST MONIZ.
TODAY, AMERICA IS NUMBER ONE IN OIL AND GAS. AMERICA IS NUMBER ONE IN WIND POWER. EVERY THREE WEEKS, WE BRING ONLINE AS MUCH SOLAR POWER AS WE DID IN ALL OF 2008. [ LAUGHTER ]

Steve: MONIZ. ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: APPARENTLY, HE TOOK HIS CURRENT JOB AFTER STEPPING DOWN AS PRESIDENT OF THE LOLLIPOP GUILD. [ APPLAUSE ] LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THIS IS PRETTY INTERESTING. I READ THAT MILLENNIALS WILL SOON BECOME THE LARGEST GENERATION IN AMERICA. AND THESE 18 TO 34-YEAR-OLDS ARE SET TO REMAKE AMERICA IN THEIR IMAGE. IN FACT, IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE THE HUGE CHANGES IN STORE ONCE THE MILLENNIALS TAKE OVER. TAKE A LOOK. THE GRAND CANYON WILL BECOME "THAT HOLE THING IN THE CROWD THAT'S TOTES CRAY-CRAY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE NEW NAME. CATCHY. NEXT, THE LIBRARY WILL BECOME "THE FREE WI-FI PLACE WHERE YOU CAN PEE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S INTERESTING. MT. RUSHMORE WILL BECOME "PHOTOBOMB MOUNTAIN." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE WILL BECOME "THE BIG RED THING FROM THE 'FULL HOUSE' OPENING."

WELL, WE'VE HAD 15 YEARS OF OUR FOUNDATION WORK. AND SO LOOKING AHEAD 15 YEARS WE SAID, "WHY ARE WE SO EXCITED? WHAT DO WE THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN?" AND WHAT WE WROTE ABOUT IS THAT, IN THESE NEXT 15 YEARS, THE LIVES OF THE POOREST ARE GOING TO IMPROVE MORE THAN EVER. AND PEOPLE AREN'T SEEING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HEALTH, OR BANKING, OR EDUCATION. SO WE THOUGHT WE'D SHOW THAT AND ACTUALLY INVITE THEM TO JOIN IN. SO IT'S A LOT MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN IF YOU JUST KIND OF LOOK AT THE HEADLINES. BUT IT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY SEEING. IT'S WHAT WE REALLY BELIEVE.
Jimmy: YOU THINK THAT WE CAN ERADICATE MORE DISEASES IN THIS TIME THAN WE EVER HAVE IN 50 YEARS.
THAT'S RIGHT. IN ALL OF HISTORY, ONLY SMALLPOX, ONE DISEASE, WAS EVER ERADICATED. THE NEXT 15, WE'RE SAYING IT WILL BE FOUR DISEASES AND EVEN MORE THEREAFTER. SO THIS HEALTH STUFF IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
Jimmy: WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH POLIO?
THAT'S A BIG ONE. WE HAVEN'T HAD A CASE IN AFRICA FOR SIX MONTHS NOW. THAT'S GIGANTIC. SO, WE'RE DOWN TO REALLY PAKISTAN. I'LL SEE THE PRIME MINISTER IN DAVOS. AND WE'LL GET SERIOUS, AND THEN WE'LL BRING IT TO AN END.
Jimmy: SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU JUST TRAVEL OVER THERE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT, AND THEN YOU SAID MONEY. HOW IS MONEY GOING TO CHANGE?
WELL, POOR PEOPLE DON'T HAVE BANK ACCOUNTS. SO WHEN THEY HAVE AN EMERGENCY, THEY WANT TO BORROW, SAVE. IT'S VERY TOUGH. SMALL TRANSACTIONS, THE FEES ARE JUST TOO HIGH WHEN YOU HAVE BANKS AND ATMs AND ALL THAT. IF WE TAKE THE CELL PHONES AND JUST USE DIGITAL CURRENCY, THEN YOU CAN HAVE ALL THOSE FINANCIAL SERVICES. SO, 2 BILLION PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF BANK ACCOUNT WILL HAVE ALL SORTS OF INNOVATIVE SERVICES TO HELP THEM SAVE, PAY FOR EDUCATION. AND IT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF WORK GETTING THE REGULATION RIGHT, GETTING IT TO CRITICAL MASS, GETTING PEOPLE TO TRUST IT. BUT THE MAGIC OF THAT CELL PHONE, WITH THE RIGHT SOFTWARE, MEANS THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE BANKING. AND THAT'S REALLY BIG FOR THEIR LIVES. THEY CAN BORROW WHEN THEY NEED TO.
Jimmy: IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS A CELL PHONE AND A SMARTPHONE NOW, BASICALLY.
MORE AND MORE. 15 YEARS AND EVEN IN THE POOR COUNTRIES, WOMEN AS MUCH AS MEN. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S PART OF IT.
Jimmy: I ALWAYS LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT I READ ABOUT YOU IN THE NEWS AND THINGS THAT YOU DID. BESIDES GATES LETTER, YOU ALSO WERE IN THE NEWS FOR -- YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS INVENTION. THE OMNI --
PROCESSOR.
Jimmy: OMNIPROCESSOR.
WE CHALLENGED ENGINEERS TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT COULD TAKE SEWAGE AND VERY INEXPENSIVELY GET RID OF SEWAGE BECAUSE SEWAGE IS BAD. IT CAUSES LOT OF DISEASE. MOST OF THE DIARRHEA IS BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE SANITATION SYSTEMS. WE SAID, IT'S WAY TOO EXPENSIVE, THE WAY THAT THE RICH COUNTRIES DO IT. MAKE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN PUT THROUGHOUT AFRICA AND GET RID OF ALL THAT SEWAGE.
Jimmy: AND YOU CHANGED IT INTO WATER THAT'S DRINKABLE WATER AND YOU DRANK IT.
YEAH, ON ONE END YOU'VE GOT SEWAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, ON THE OTHER END --
Jimmy: YOU GOT SEWAGE.
NO, THEN YOU GET SOME ELECTRICITY AND YOU GET WATER.
Jimmy: YEAH. THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO GLASSES OF WATER.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: YOU BROUGHT SOME.
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE TASTE TEST. WE THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIGURE THIS OUT.
Jimmy: WELL, ALREADY I'VE GOT A GUESS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I HAVE TO GUESS WHICH ONE IS THE SEWAGE WATER. BUT ONE IS BOTTLED WATER, ONE IS SEWAGE WATER. BUT WE'RE GOING TO DRINK, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE. AND YOU'RE GOING TO REVEAL WHICH ONE IS WHICH.
YOU BET.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU DO BET.
LET'S DO A TASTE TEST.
Jimmy: SEE, NOW I'M THINKING BECAUSE YOU'RE SMART.
YOU GET TO PICK.
Jimmy: YEAH, I GET TO PICK, RIGHT?
I TOLD THEM HOW TO SET THIS UP.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, OKAY. [ DRUM ROLL ] TOO EASY.
YEAH, IT'S REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY. YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I NEVER WANT TO GAMBLE AGAINST BILL GATES EVER! YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK YOU'RE TOO NICE. SO I'M GOING TO LET YOU SWITCH IT OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND THEN, I WON'T EVEN LOOK AT THE NUMBER ON THE THING.
ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT?
THERE WE GO.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT.
CHEERS.
Jimmy: ON THE COUNT OF THREE. CHEERS. ONE, TWO, THREE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHICH ONE DID YOU GET? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MAKING SURE YOU THAT DRANK IT. ALL RIGHT, NO. THIS ONE ACTUALLY TASTED PRETTY GOOD. YOU JUST DRANK YOURS. CHEERS. WOW. [ APPLAUSE ] I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THAT WAS -- THIS IS THE BOTTLED WATER.
WELL, THAT WAS RIGGED. IT WAS ALL POOP WATER. ♪♪ [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT WAS BOTH POOP WATER?
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE, BILL GATES! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT TO ME. GOSH! REALLY, THAT WAS IT?
THAT'S AS PURE AS ANY WATER YOU'VE EVER HAD.
Jimmy: IT TASTED REALLY GOOD.
YEAH. WELL, IT WAS GOOD POOP.
Jimmy: YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE NAME, BUT YOU GOT A A DIFFERENT BUSINESS THERE.
IT'S THE MACHINE. THE MACHINE IS PRETTY MIRACULOUS.
Jimmy: HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
WELL, YOU BOIL IT. YOU FILTER IT. THAT'S WHAT ENGINEERS KNOW HOW TO DO. THAT'LL BE IN AFRICA.
Jimmy: I THINK IT WORKED. IT TASTES PRETTY GOOD. I'VE GOT TO GIVE IT UP. I'VE GOT TO GIVE IT UP. THANK YOU, BUDDY. MY THANKS TO BILL GATES. GO TO GATESLETTER.COM. MARIO BATALI'S COOKING FOR US NEXT. THERE HE IS IN THE XBOX GREENROOM. HEY, MARIO BATALI! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
