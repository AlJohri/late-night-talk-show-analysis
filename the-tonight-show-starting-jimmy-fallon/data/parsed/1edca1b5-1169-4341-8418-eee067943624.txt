Jimmy: OH, THAT'S CUTE.
YEAH, THEY WERE REALLY LONG. AND ANY TIME ANYONE TRIED TO GET UP AND LEAVE, I SAID, "IT'S NOT OVER!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU WOULD WRITE THE PLAYS AND ACT IN THE PLAYS?
UH-HUH.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S GREAT. AND PERFORMED THE WHOLE --
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WAS SO GREAT. FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.
Jimmy: FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.
BUT I HAD -- CLEARLY I ENJOYED IT, BECAUSE I KEPT ON DOING IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU HAD A BUNCH OF THEM. AND DID YOU -- DO YOU SAVE THE PLAYS? DO YOU STILL HAVE THEM?
OBVIOUSLY, I MEAN -- THERE ARE HOME VIDEOS, I'M SURE.
Jimmy: OH, NEXT TIME YOU COME ON, WE NEED TO SEE THIS.
I DON'T KNOW IF THE TAPE IS LONG ENOUGH. YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, WE GOTTA SEE THIS NEXT TIME.
YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK TO MY DAD.
Jimmy: HOW IS IT LIKE WHEN YOU'RE -- I ENJOYED THE MOVIE, AND I SEE THESE SCENES. BUT YOU'RE IN A SCENE WITH YOUR MOM PLAYING YOUR MOM IN THE MOVIE. AGAIN, A BIG ACTING STRETCH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO -- WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? YOU HAVE TO REALLY YELL AT HER AND SCREAM AT HER.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND I WOULD BE NERVOUS IF THAT WAS MY MOM.
I WAS. THAT'S TRUE. I WAS NERVOUS. I WAS A LITTLE --
Jimmy: DID YOU FEEL GUILTY YELLING AT YOUR MOM?
I FELT LIKE I DIDN'T -- I DIDN'T WANT HER TO LIKE -- I DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE WOUNDING IN ANY WAY.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WOULD FEEL, TOO.
BUT THEN I -- THE DIRECTOR YELLED "CUT" AND I LOOKED AT HER AND I WAS ABOUT TO RUN OVER AND GIVE HER A HUG AND TELL HER IT WAS ALL MAKE BELIEVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "I'M JUST KIDDING, MOM. I REALLY LOVE YOU."
BUT SHE JUST HAD THIS BIG GRIN ON HER FACE, BECAUSE I THINK SHE'S JUST PROUD OF ME.
Jimmy: AW, COME ON, SEE? THAT'S AWESOME. [ APPLAUSE ] SHE SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOU.
THANKS.
Jimmy: BUT JONATHAN DEMME WAS THE DIRECTOR. AMAZING. HE WANTED TO CREATE SOME TENSION ON THE SET.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND SO HE TOLD YOUR MOM NOT TO TALK TO YOU?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YUP.
Jimmy: AND YOUR MOM DID IT?
UH-UH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DID YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON?
NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.
I KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. HE TOLD HER THAT HE FELT THAT WE SHOULD BE SEPARATED. AND SO SHE WAS GAME. AND SHE WENT ALONG WITH THAT. BUT NOBODY TOLD ME THAT. SO I JUST SORT OF FELT LIKE, WHY IS EVERYBODY LIKE HANGING OUT WITHOUT ME? [ AUDIENCE AWES ] I KNOW, THANK YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. YOU'RE MAKING US FEEL BAD, BUT THIS ADDED TO YOUR PERFORMANCE.
YEAH, YEAH. I MEAN -- BUT ULTIMATELY THE IDEA WAS TO KIND OF PLAY INTO, I THINK -- I THINK, I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY CONFIRMED THIS WITH HIM. THIS IS JUST WHAT I'VE DECIDED -- THAT HE WANTED HER TO FEEL ABANDONED AND, YOU KNOW, KIND OF PLAY -- FEED INTO THE ANGER THAT SHE HAD.
Jimmy: DID YOU EVENTUALLY KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON? DID YOU GO, "OH, THEY'RE DOING THIS ON PURPOSE?"
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU GO, "I FIGURED YOU OUT, JONATHAN. YEAH, DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO."
I WENT TO THEATER SCHOOL.
Jimmy: HELLO, I PLAYED A A 21-MONTH-OLD AND I WAS A A 20-MONTH, OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. IT'S FUN. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE. GREAT PERFORMANCE BY THE WAY. FANTASTIC. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S MAMIE GUMMER IN "RICKI AND THE FLASH." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
