WE HAD THIS BIG AFTER PARTY AND PRINCE ENDED UP GETTING ONSTAGE AND IT WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE. HE PLAYED "LET'S GO CRAZY" AND THE CROWD WAS -- IT WAS JUST SO FUN AND AMAZING. I WAS JUST THINKING OF ALL THE STORIES. AND I JUST GOT SAD, YOU KNOW. AND WE HAVE A HANDFUL OF GREAT STORIES WITH PRINCE.

Jimmy: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Questlove: BUT I WAS IN BED. AND THEN I GOT A TEXT. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS THIRD PARTY TEXTING. LIKE, "HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU." YOU ALWAYS KNOW THAT "HE" IS PRINCE. RIGHT.
Jimmy: HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.
Questlove: RIGHT, HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. SO HE'S LIKE, "TELL JIMMY THAT I'LL BE AT SUSAN SARANDON'S SPIN AND I WANT TO CHALLENGE HIM AT PING-PONG."
Jimmy: YEAH, NO, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. YEAH. THIS IS A TRUE STORY.
Questlove: RIGHT.
Jimmy: BUT IT'S PERFECT. THIS IS LIKE -- PRINCE IS ONE OF THESE GUYS. HE'S AN ICON, HE'S LEGENDARY, HE'S VERY MYSTERIOUS. LIKE, SO MUCH MYSTIQUE AROUND. YOU DON'T REALLY -- THESE ARE THESE FAMOUS STORIES THAT YOU HEAR THAT DON'T THINK ARE REAL, BUT THEY'RE REAL.
Questlove: SUPER REAL. AND I WAS LIKE, "WELL, YOU KNOW, HE JUST HAD HIS DAUGHTER TONIGHT. SO, I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S UP TO PLAYING YOU." HE WAS LIKE, "OKAY, WELL, JUST LET HIM KNOW I'LL BE AT SUSAN SARANDON'S AT 12:30."
Jimmy: SUSAN SARANDON HAS A A PING-PONG CLUB IN NEW YORK CITY.
Questlove: RIGHT.
Jimmy: THIS ALL CAME -- HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. SIT DOWN FOR THIS. SO, FIRST OF ALL, CHRIS ROCK WAS ON THE SHOW. WE WERE TALKING TO CHRIS, TALKING ABOUT WHAT OUR FAVORITE CONCERTS WERE. HE GOES, "PRINCE IS MY FAVORITE." I SAID, "OH, I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM." "YOU NEVER SEEN PRINCE? YOU'VE GOT TO SEE PRINCE! WHO DOESN'T SEE PRINCE? YOU LIKE MUSIC, YOU HAVE TO SEE PRINCE! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU NEVER SAW IT!" I GO, "ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE PRINCE." [ APPLAUSE ] GIVE ME A BREAK. "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T SEE PRINCE!" SO I GO -- I GO -- I GET TICKETS, I GO SEE PRINCE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. AND HE'S UNBELIEVABLE. AND YOU WERE THERE.
Questlove: YEAH.
Jimmy: AND SO I REMEMBER THIS, BECAUSE HERE'S THE END OF THE STORY. AS I'M WATCHING, THREE SONGS INTO IT, SOMEONE TAPS ME ON THE SHOULDER SAYS, "HEY, I'M FROM PRINCE'S MANAGEMENT. HE WOULD LOVE IF YOU GET ONSTAGE AND DANCE WITH HIM. AT THE END." I GO, "OH, NO, I'M NOT A A DANCER. THANK YOU." I'M JUST ENJOYING WATCHING THE SHOW. "OKAY, HE'S GONNA DISAPPOINTED." I GO, "I DON'T THINK SO. IT'LL BE FINE." LATER ON THE SHOW, SOMEONE TAPS ME ON THE SHOULDER, THEY GO, "HEY, I'M FROM PRINCE'S MANAGEMENT. HE WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO GET ONSTAGE AT THE END AND DANCE WITH HIM." I GO, "I DON'T THINK HE WOULD." YOU SEE HOW I DANCE? I'M NOT LIKE A -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] REALLY WOULD BE A DOWNER FOR PEOPLE IF I DID THAT, YOU KNOW. I'D RATHER NOT. HE'S UNBELIEVABLE, I'M IN AWE RIGHT NOW WATCHING HIM. "OKAY, HE'S GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED." I GO, "HE WON'T BE." ANYWAY. CONCERT'S OVER. THEY START BRINGING PEOPLE UP ON THE STAGE. AND I SEE QUESTLOVE GOING -- I GO, "YOU'RE GOING TO GO UP ONSTAGE?" YOU GO, "YEAH. C'MON." I GO, "REALLY? OKAY." SO I GO UP WITH YOU. YOU WALK BEHIND A DRUM SET AND START PLAYING DRUMS. I'M DANCING BY MYSELF. PRINCE LEAVES. [ LAUGHTER ] HE GOES DOWN -- HE GOES DOWN AN ELEVATOR AND I'M LIKE -- I'M JUST DANCING LIKE THIS BY MYSELF. GIRLS ARE ROLLER SKATING AROUND ME.
Questlove: RIGHT.
Jimmy: I'M THERE WITH A.J. FROM "ACCESS" OR FROM "EXTRA."
Questlove: "EXTRA." HE LEFT YOU OUT THERE HANGING.
Jimmy: LEFT ME OUT THERE. ANYWAYS, SO THEN HE'S COMING ON THE SHOW. PRINCE, WE BOOKED HIM ON THE SHOW. AND I WAS SO EXCITED. HIS PEOPLE CALL UP AND THEY GO, "PRINCE REALLY WANTS TO PLAY PING-PONG AGAINST JIMMY."
Questlove: YEAH.
Jimmy: SO I GO, "BEER PONG?" AND THEY GO, "NO, PING-PONG." I GO, "WE DON'T PLAY PING-PONG ON THE SHOW." SO THEY, "OH, OKAY, SURE." THEY CALL BACK, THEY GO, "NO, PRINCE DOES NOT WANT TO PLAY PING-PONG." OKAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY CALLED BACK. THEY GO, "YEAH, WE RETHOUGHT IT. PRINCE REALLY WANTS TO PLAY PING-PONG." SURE. LOOK, AS LONG AS PRINCE WANTS TO PLAY MUSIC. THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT HIM TO DO. SO, WHATEVER IS GOING TO MAKE HIM HAPPY. THEY CALL BACK. "HE DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY PING-PONG." I GO, "OKAY, FINE. WE'LL HAVE IT SET UP JUST IN CASE HE FEELS LIKE PLAYING PING-PONG." THIS IS A REAL STORY. SO WE GET THE THING -- THEY CALL BACK. THEY SAID, "HE WANTS TO PLAY PING-PONG, BUT NOT ON CAMERA." I GO, "WHY?" [ LAUGHTER ] THEY GO, "WE THINK -- PRINCE THINKS JIMMY WOULD BE FUN TO PLAY PING-PONG WITH." I GO, "ALL RIGHT, LET'S BRING IT ON, MAN. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO." HE COMES TO THE SHOW. DOESN'T EVEN LOOK AT THE PING-PONG TABLE. PERFORMS THAT NIGHT. DESTROYS. HAS THE GREATEST SHOW EVER.
Questlove: LITERALLY.
Jimmy: KIRK LENT HIM HIS -- KIRK LENT HIM HIS GUITAR AND HE BROKE -- THAT'S A LONG STORY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT HE PAID FOR IT. HE PAID FOR IT, RIGHT? HE DID PAY FOR IT. AND THEN -- YEAH, SO THEN PRINCE LEAVES AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT'S THIS PING-PONG THING ALL ABOUT?" SO --
Questlove: HE CALLS ME.
Jimmy: YEAH.
Questlove: AND SAYS, "I'LL BE THERE AT 12:30." AND I SAID YOU JUST HAD BABY. HE'S LIKE, "YEAH, THAT'S NICE. TELL HIM I'LL BE THERE." [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS LIKE, "WHAT PART OF BABY DOES HE NOT GET?"
Jimmy: HE DOESN'T GET IT. HE'S PRINCE.
Questlove: SO THEN I -- YOU KNOW, I CALLED YOU. I WAS LIKE, "HE WANTS TO PLAY YOU RIGHT NOW." YOU WERE LIKE, "RIGHT NOW?" I WAS LIKE, "JIMMY, YOU JUST HAD A BABY."

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I GO, "YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH. I'M HERE TO SEE PRINCE." SHE GOES, "RIGHT THIS WAY. HE'S BEHIND THAT CURTAIN." I OPEN THE CURTAIN. AND PRINCE IS STANDING THERE WITH A DOUBLE-BREASTED CRUSHED BLUE VELVET SUIT, HOLDING A A PING-PONG PADDLE. AND HE GOES, "YOU READY TO DO THIS?" [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] WHAT'S GOING ON?

HE HITS IT, FIRST THING, IT GOES RIGHT OFF TABLE AND HE SCORES. HE GOES, "1-ZIP." [ LAUGHTER ] TALKING SMACK NOW. HE'S TALKING SMACK. I START GETTING MAD, I'M VERY COMPETITIVE. SO I'M LIKE, "LET'S GO, PRINCE. LET'S DO THIS, MAN I DON'T CARE, LET'S GO FOR IT. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S BAMBI EYES, LET'S DO THIS." [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE PLAYING AND I'M NOT THAT GREAT AT PING-PONG AT ALL. SO IT'S PROBABLY 10-20. IT'S HIS SERVE. HE GOES, "GAME POINT." I GO, "HERE WE GO, MAN." AND HE HITS THIS BALL AND IT'S LIKE -- AND IT'S LIKE SLOW MOTION. IT'S TURNING. AND I COULD SEE IT TURNING. FLAMES ARE COMING OFF IT. IT HITS THE EDGE OF THE TABLE, YOU KNOW, THE PERFECT PART, IT'S UNHITTABLE. WHERE IT GOES FLYING. BUT HE SCORES THE POINT. HITS THE EDGE OF THE TABLE, HE WINS THE GAME, THE BALL GOES FLYING. I GO BACK TO GET THE BALL, I'M LOOKING FOR IT, I GET THE BALL AND I GO -- AND HE'S GONE. [ LAUGHTER ] GONE. [ APPLAUSE ] I GO, "PRINCE? PRINCE? PRINCE?" I DON'T KNOW HIM THAT WELL.

I JUST SAID, "NO, BUILD IT." WE BUILT IT. ACTUALLY, WE BUILT -- WE BUILT ECUADOR 50 MINUTES FROM MY HOTEL. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WHEN THEY SAID, "WE BUILT ECUADOR." I SAID, "HOW FAR IS IT FROM THE HOTEL?" THEY SAID, "ABOUT 50 MINUTES." I WENT, "50 MINUTES?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU COULD BE IN ECUADOR!
I KNOW. I DON'T LIKE FLYING, I HAVE TO FLY ENOUGH ANYWAY.

YOU KNOW. BUT I STILL THINK, OH -- AND THEN THEY DO THE SAFETY VIDEO AND THEY TALK ABOUT LANDING ON WATER AND ALL THAT. I THINK, "GEEZ, CAN WE NOT DO THIS?" THIS IS NOT -- THAT -- SO, OKAY, RIGHT. SO I REALLY WATCH THESE VIDEOS. BECAUSE I ALWAYS FEEL SELF CONSCIOUS, THE POOR HOSTESS LOOKS AT ME AND THINKS, "OH HE'S TAKIN' THE MICKEY. I'VE GOT ALL THESE FUNNY SIGNS, HE'S A COMEDIAN."
Jimmy: I FEEL THAT WAY TOO.
SO I REALLY MAKE SURE I'M LIKE, "HMM, THIS IS INTERESTING." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND SO IT'S THAT BIT WHEN THEY GET TO THE -- "YOU'LL FIND A LIFE JACKET, AND YOU HAVE -- IF YOU LAND ON WATER, YOU HAVE A LIFE JACKET. AND ON THE LIFE JACKET IS A A LIGHT, AND A WHISTLE." I MEAN, THAT'S GREAT AT A A DISCO, BUT NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RUBBISH, ISN'T IT?
