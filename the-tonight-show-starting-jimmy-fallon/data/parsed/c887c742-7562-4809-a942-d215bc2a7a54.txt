Jimmy: OH, HEY! HELLO! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! FANTASTIC, EVERYBODY! HEY! OH, YEAH. I LOVE IT. WELCOME. WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON, AND -- [ CHEERS ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. IT'S THANKSGIVING, EVERYONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I JUST WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO FELL ASLEEP WITH THEIR TV SET TO NBC. FOOD COMA RATINGS COUNT AS RATINGS AND IT'S JUST GREAT. ACTUALLY, IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS IT MEANS YOU GOT THROUGH IT. THANKSGIVING IS OVER! YOU NEVER HAVE TO SEE THOSE PEOPLE AGAIN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] UNTIL CHRISTMAS, BUT OF COURSE, SOME OF YOU ARE VISITING FAMILY OR FRIENDS FOR THE HOLIDAY. AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE, I JUST WANT TO SAY IF YOU'RE STILL AT SOMEONE'S HOUSE FOR THANKSGIVING RIGHT NOW, THEY WANT YOU TO LEAVE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'VE ALREADY WASHED YOUR TUPPERWARE AND HANDED IT BACK TO YOU. TAKE A HINT. LEAVE. HEY, GARY I WENT AND STARTED YOUR CAR OUT THERE. IT'S ALL WARMED UP FOR YOU. GUYS, I SAW THAT THERE WERE THREE NFL GAMES TODAY. THE EAGLES VERSUS THE LIONS, THE PANTHERS VERSUS THE COWBOYS AND THE BEARS VERSUS THE PACKERS. WHILE TOM BRADY AND THE PATRIOTS CAME TO THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE HERE IN NEW YORK JUST TO DEFLATE THE BALLOONS A LITTLE BIT. ISN'T THAT NICE? SO, NICE. IT WAS SO THOUGHTFUL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT.
Steve: NO!
Jimmy: THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
Steve: NO, THEY LOVE. IT'S ALL ABOUT LOVE.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THANKSGIVING IS ALWAYS A BIG INSTAGRAM HOLIDAY. EVERYBODY WANTS THAT PERFECT PICTURE TO SHARE WITH THEIR FRIENDS. BUT, SOMETIMES THE CAPTIONS AREN'T QUITE RIGHT. TAKE A LOOK AT A FEW OF THESE, AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN. ALL RIGHT. HERE'S THE FIRST ONE. IT LOOKS LIKE A NICE FAMILY. THE CAPTION SAYS, "OUR ANNUAL GAME OF FLAG FOOTBALL." MORE ACCURATE CAPTION SHOULD SAY, "TIME TO TAKE OUT SOME PENT-UP RAGE ON MY NEPHEW." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS TACKLE. SORRY. WIPE THAT BLOOD OFF. YEAH. NEXT PICTURE SAYS, "GREAT TO HAVE ALL OF THE GRANDKIDS TOGETHER ON THANKSGIVING." A MORE ACCURATE CAPTION WOULD BE, "RARE MOMENT WHEN MY GRANDKIDS MANAGE TO LOOK UP FROM THEIR PRECIOUS MINECRAFT LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH OTHER HUMAN BEINGS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, HERE IS THE LAST PICTURE. THE CAPTION SAYS, "I LOVE MY FAMILY." AW, THE MORE ACCURATE CAPTION SHOULD BE, "I'M THE LEAST IMPORTANT MEMBER OF MY FAMILY, SO THEY HAD ME TAKE THIS PHOTO." YOU ALL LOOK GOOD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, THIS IS A DAY WHEN WE'RE REMINDED OF ALL THE THINGS WE SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR, WHILE A NEW STUDY RECENTLY FOUND THAT THE KEY TO HAPPY MARRIAGE IS REGULARLY EXPRESSING YOUR GRATITUDE TO YOUR SPOUSE. WHEN COUPLES HEARD THAT, THEY SAID YOU FIRST. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DID YOU GUYS HEAR ABOUT THIS? THERE ARE NEW REPORTS THAT THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER OUTBREAK OF THE BIRD FLU. THE BIRD FLU.

Jimmy: GUYS, WE -- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER IN THE WEEK, BUT THE BIG BUSINESS NEWS IS STILL THIS MEGAMERGER BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES THAT MAKE VIAGRA AND BOTOX. [ LAUGHTER ] VIAGRA AND BOTOX IS MERGING INTO ONE ENTITY. IT'S CALLED THE PLAYBOY MANSION. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD OF IT. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CHECK THAT OUT. OH, THIS IS INTERESTING. A NEW SURVEY FOUND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE U.K. DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR FOOD COMES FROM. AND MANY THINK FISH STICKS COME FROM THE FINGERS OF FISH. [ LAUGHTER ] WHILE PEOPLE IN THE U.S. ARE, LIKE, "IDIOTS. EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S CHICKENS WHO GOT THE FINGERS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, THE ROCKY SPIN-OFF "CREED" CAME OUT THIS WEEK. AND CRITICS ARE SAYING IT'S THE BEST "ROCKY" FILM SINCE THE ORIGINAL. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, BUT AS FAR AS ROCKY MOVES GO, IT'S DEFINITELY IN THE TOP 40. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

Jimmy: ALWAYS FUN! I ALWAYS LOVE HAVING YOU HERE.
JIMMY, YOU GOT KOOL KEITH OVER THERE.

I'M HAVING FLASHBACKS OF LATIN QUARTERS WHEN I WAS RUNNING THE STREETS WHEN I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN OUT.
Jimmy: I MEAN, COME ON.
IT WAS FUN!
THAT'S MY FRIEND. I AIN'T SEEN HER IN A LONG TIME.
THAT'S RIGHT. I KNOW. GOOD TO SEE YOU, BRO. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. THANKSGIVING, PEOPLE ARE COMING TOGETHER, LOVING EACH OTHER.
TOGETHER.
Jimmy: THANKFUL FOR EACH OTHER, YEAH.
APPRECIATED.
Jimmy: AND I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE FLYING OUT TO MARYLAND? IS THAT WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO?
OH, NO. WE'RE DRIVING. ROAD TRIP!
Jimmy: OH, YEAH?
YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
GOTTA GO TO MD. [ CHEERS ] LOAD EVERYBODY UP IN THE CAR, THE MUSIC, YOU KNOW? MOMS AND ALL THE COUSINS AND SISTERS.
Jimmy: THAT'S GONNA BE FUN.
HIT THE ROAD AND GO TO MARYLAND. HANG OUT WITH MY UNCLE AND AUNT JIMMY AND VIRGINIA AND MY GRANDMOTHER, THE WHOLE FAMILY. YOU KNOW, TENS AND TENS AND TENS OF US, LOTS OF FOOD.
Jimmy: IT'S A FUN HOLIDAY.
THANKSGIVING.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING.
NO. FOOD, FOOTBALL. FAMILY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A WHO? A FOOTBALL?
AND REPEAT, AND REPEAT.
Jimmy: AND REPEAT, EXACTLY, YEAH.
AND REPEAT. AND REPEAT.
Jimmy: AND I SHOULD SAY, YOUR MOM INSPIRED YOU TO GET INVOLVED WITH THIS CHARITY THING. I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT.
YES, YES. WE'RE DOING A CAMPAIGN, OR WE'RE SUPPORTING A CAMPAIGN CALLED BY THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NOVARTIS. IT'S BASICALLY -- IT'S CALLED THE "RISE ABOVE HEART FAILURE CAMPAIGN," AND WE'RE BASICALLY TRYING TO BRING ATTENTION TO HEART FAILURE, BECAUSE A LOT OF AMERICANS -- MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DEAL WITH HEART FAILURE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SYMPTOMS ARE. THEY MAY NOT KNOW THEY HAVE IT OR THEY KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS IT OR THEY DO HAVE IT AND THEY REALLY -- WE REALLY WANT THEM TO MAKE LITTLE, SMALL CHANGES IN THEIR LIFESTYLE SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE HOSPITALIZED. YOU KNOW, TALKING TO YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU GAIN TWO POUNDS OVERNIGHT. THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS HEART FAILURE, BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU'RE RETAINING FLUIDS PROBABLY. YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR DOCTOR. YOU KNOW, REALLY JUST KIND OF STAY ON IT. AND IT'S A GREAT CAMPAIGN 'CAUSE IT'S ALSO FOR THE CAREGIVERS. MY MOTHER IS DEALING WITH HEART FAILURE, AND SHE'S DOING REALLY WELL BECAUSE SHE'S VERY DILIGENT AND SHE STAYS ON HER MEDICATIONS AND SHE TAKES THEM AS DIRECTED AND WEIGHS HERSELF EVERY DAY AT THE SAME TIME, SAME CLOTHES. BUT SHE REALLY KIND OF STAYS ON IT, BUT WE TAKE CARE OF HER. MYSELF, MY SISTER, AND CERTAIN FAMILY MEMBERS, AND THIS IS A A GOOD SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS, OF PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE. BECAUSE YOU GOTTA TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, TOO.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU GOTTA DO IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
A FAMILY, A FOOD, AND FOOTBALL --
Jimmy: FOOTBALL AND FOOD. YEAH.
AND RISING ABOVE HEART FAILURE.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FAILURE IS THE FOURTH F. HEART FAILURE.
YES. THAT'S RIGHT. WE WANT TO PREVENT IT. WE WANT TO KEEP YOU OUT THE HOSPITAL.
Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD. NO, I WANT MY PARENTS TO --
YEAH, GO TO RISEABOVEHF.ORG.
Jimmy: MY MOM SAID SHE HAS SYMPTOMS. SHE'S LIKE, "YEAH, I HAVE THAT." [ LAUGHTER ] NO, YOU DON'T HAVE THAT. WE'RE JUST PROBABLY LIKE, "NO. I'M SICK, TOO." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I GO, "NO, YOU'RE NOT." "I HAVE A COUGH." "OH, I'VE HAD A TICKLE IN MY THROAT TOO." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING IS GOING WRONG, AND MY MOM HAS EVERYTHING. ALL OF THE TIME. I'M SICK. OH, YEAH, I'M FEELING A LITTLE SICK, TOO. NO, THAT'S MY THING. I'M SICK TODAY.
SHE WANTS TO BE DOWN? SHE WANTS TO BE A PART OF IT.
Jimmy: I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS AT THE EMMYS AND YOU LOOKED GORGEOUS. "BESSIE." I MEAN, YOU --
YEAH.
Jimmy: JUST UNBELIEVABLE IN THAT. YOU WON FIVE EMMYS THAT NIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I KNOW IT WAS A BIG THING FOR YOU TO MAKE THAT EVEN HAPPEN, AND YOU JUST HIT THAT ONE OUT OF THE PARK, MAN.
THAT PROJECT WAS 22 YEARS IN THE MAKING.
Jimmy: OH, GOD.
TO TAKE SOMETHING DOWN THAT LONG.
Jimmy: YOU CAN SING, THOUGH! MY GOSH! I MEAN, I'VE KNOWN YOU FOREVER AND I KNOW YOU SING, AND I KNOW YOU CAN RAP, BUT I MEAN, YOU CAN REALLY, REALLY, REALLY SING. AMAZING. I GO, "OH MY GOSH, YOU GOTTA GET THE SOUNDTRACK TO 'BESSIE.'"
PLEASE DO.
Jimmy: CHECK IT OUT, BECAUSE YOU WILL FREAK OUT. IT'S AMAZING. AND NOW I THINK -- IS THAT WHAT MADE NBC GO, "HEY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO 'THE WIZ'?" OR HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT?
HONESTLY, FROM THE MOMENT I HEARD NEIL AND CRAIG WERE DOING THIS -- THOSE ARE THE PRODUCERS.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
AND I'VE DONE "CHICAGO" WITH THEM AND I'VE DONE "HAIRSPRAY" WITH THEM. I'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS, AND THEY'VE BEEN -- I KNOW THEY'RE TOP-NOTCH PRODUCERS. AND THEY DID THE LAST TWO THAT WERE HERE ON NBC -- "SOUND OF MUSIC," "PETER PAN."
Jimmy: OH, THEY'RE GIANT.
IT'S GREAT. SO JUST A HINT OF THE WORD THAT THEY MIGHT BE DOING "THE WIZ." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE WHIZ. THERE'S NO H IN THERE.
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
Jimmy: THE WHIZ.
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THERE'S A H IN "THE WIZ."
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT W-H-I-Z. NOT THE WHIZ.
IT'S THE WHIZ, JIMMY!

Jimmy: LET'S GO THROUGH THE CAST.
I MEAN --

LET'S TALK ABOUT MARY J. BLIGE.
Jimmy: NO, SHE'S FANTASTIC. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: WHO'S THAT?

Jimmy: EVILINE. OKAY.

Jimmy: WHO?
UZO ADUBA.
Jimmy: UZO ADUBA'S IN IT?

Jimmy: I KNOW HER AS CRAZY EYES, ABSOLUTELY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE CRAZY EYES. SHE IS GONNA BLOW YOUR MINDS IN THIS. AMBER RILEY, WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT NE-YO. ELIJAH KELLY.
