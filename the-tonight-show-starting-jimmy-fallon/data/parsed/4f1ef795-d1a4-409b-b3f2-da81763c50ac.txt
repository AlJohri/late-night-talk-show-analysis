YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU MADE THE SHOW. YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOU GUYS, THE FINALISTS FOR TIME'S "PERSON OF THE YEAR" JUST CAME OUT. AND THEY INCLUDE DONALD TRUMP, HILLARY CLINTON, MARK ZUCKERBERG, VLADIMIR PUTIN, AND BEYONCE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] PUTIN WAS LIKE, "MOST OF GROUP IS WEAK, BUT EVEN I CANNOT COMPETE WITH QUEEN B. NO, I MEAN, LET'S BE -- COME ON." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF BEYONCE, BOTH SHE AND ADELE GOT A BUNCH OF GRAMMY NOMINATIONS TODAY. THEY WERE EACH NOMINATED FOR RECORD OF THE YEAR, SONG OF THE YEAR, AND ALBUM OF THE YEAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MARKING -- MARKING THE FIRST TIME IN 2016, THAT AMERICA HAS TWO FINALISTS THAT THEY ACTUALLY LIKE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. THIS IS KIND OF INTERESTING. YESTERDAY, JOE BIDEN SAID HE'S NOT COMPLETELY RULING OUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020. EVEN SAID, "WHAT THE HELL." [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED WHAT HIS CAMPAIGN SLOGAN WOULD BE, HE SAID, "I JUST TOLD YOU. WHAT THE HELL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT THE HELL. MEANWHILE, THE WHITE HOUSE JUST ANNOUNCED A NEW PROGRAM TO TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE TO MORE AMERICAN SCHOOLCHILDREN. YEAH, THEY SAY IF IT GOES WELL, ONE DAY AMERICA WILL BE ABLE TO HACK ITS OWN ELECTION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ISN'T THAT NICE? THAT'S SO THOUGHTFUL.
Steve: YEAH, PROGRESS.
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT NICE?
Steve: PROGRESS. [ APPLAUSE ] LISTEN TO THIS. I READ AT -- THAT AS PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE ACCESS TO AN EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM WHICH WILL ALLOW HIM TO SEND A A TEXT TO EVERY AMERICAN AT ONCE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S ONLY FOR EMERGENCIES, LIKE NATURAL DISASTERS, SECURITY ISSUES, OR IF "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" DOES ANOTHER SKETCH ABOUT HIM. BUT THAT'S IT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ONLY EMERGENCIES. ACTUALLY, VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT HE TWEETS. CHENEY SAID," IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU COULD END UP SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FACE -- OR FOOT. FOOT. [ LAUGHTER ] SHOOTING YOUR FRIEND IN THE -- SHOOTING YOUR FRIEND'S FOOT. SHOOTING YOURSELF -- IN THE FOOT. SORRY, WHAT'D I SAY?
Jimmy: I'M GOING TO LEAVE NOW. I JUST HEARD THAT LAST NIGHT, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT MIKE PENCE ATTENDED THE NEW YORK JETS GAME AT MET LIFE STADIUM, WHERE THE JETS LOST 41-10. PENCE HEARD SO MUCH BOOING, HE THOUGHT HE WAS SEEING "HAMILTON" AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TO CELEBRATE THE STANDING ROCK, SIOUX TRIBE'S VICTORY AGAINST THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE, JOSH BROLIN POSTED A NUDE PHOTO OF HIMSELF STANDING ON TOP OF A A ROCK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IN RESPONSE, THE SIOUX TRIBE SAID, "WE'RE OPPOSED TO THAT PIPELINE TOO." SO WOULD YOU JUST -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HO! HEY!
Jimmy: THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. I SAW A THAT A PRIVATE COMPANY CALLED "MOON EXPRESS" SAYS IT WANTS TO START OFFERING TRIPS TO THE MOON FOR UNDER $10,000 A TICKET. MOST PEOPLE WERE LIKE, "YEAH, I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO BOOK THE CHEAPEST OPTION FOR MY TRIP TO OUTER SPACE." [ APPLAUSE ] THAT COMPANY CHEAPER? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IF I'M GONNA GO TO SPACE -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CHECK THIS OUT, YOU GUYS. AMAZON LAUNCHED ITS NEW "GO APP." DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS THING? IT'S PRETTY COOL. IT LETS YOU SHOP IN THE SUPERMARKET WITHOUT HAVING TO CHECK OUT AT THE REGISTER. THERE'S NO REGISTER. YEAH, THEY SAY IT'S JUST LIKE SHOPPING ON THEIR WEBSITE, UNTIL YOU GET ARRESTED FOR BEING DRUNK AND IN YOUR UNDERWEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] I NEED THIS. NEXT DAY, NEXT DAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ UNINTELLIGIBLE ] THAT'S RIGHT, AMAZON'S NEW APP LETS YOU SHOP IN A STORE WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE CHECKOUT LINE, AND THE AD IS GOING VIRAL TODAY. HERE'S JUST THE FIRST PART OF IT. RIGHT HERE, CHECK IT OUT.
WHAT WOULD SHOPPING LOOK LIKE IF YOU COULD WALK INTO A A STORE, GRAB WHAT YOU WANT, AND JUST GO? USE THE "AMAZON GO APP", TO ENTER. THEN PUT AWAY YOUR PHONE, AND START SHOPPING.
Jimmy: YEAH. PRETTY COOL. BUT I -- I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER REASON PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO TRY OUT THIS NEW APP. HERE'S ANOTHER VERSION.
EVER WANTED THAT GUILTY PLEASURE OF PICKING SOMETHING UP, AND JUST WALKING OUT OF THE STORE? GO AHEAD, TAKE STUFF OFF OUR SHELVES AND HIDE IT IN YOUR JACKET, THEN JUST WALK OUT LIKE A COMMON CRIMINAL. AMAZON SHOPLIFT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WITH ALL OF THE SHOPLIFTING, WITH NONE OF THE GUILT. [ APPLAUSE ]

THE PICKLES AND PEPPERS.
Jimmy: THERE'S PICKLES AND PEPPERS IN ONE, BUT THEN, THERE'S, LIKE, A CHILI -- LIKE, A HOT DOG CHILI SAUCE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN IT. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A CHILI SAUCE.
IT HAS AMAZING, AND I WAS JUST HOME FOR THANKSGIVING. AND I DROVE BY TONY PACKO'S, AND I WAS THINKING OF YOU --
Jimmy: DID YOU?
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT YOU LOVED IT, AND --
Jimmy: OH, I LOVED THAT. IT'S JUST, THAT WAS THE MOST THOUGHTFUL COOL THING.
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? TOLEDO IS AMAZING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S TONY PACKO'S. BUT, I WAS JUST HOME, AND I WENT TO ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES, THIS LEBANESE RESTAURANT, AND I WENT IN, AND I ORDERED AHEAD. AND THE OWNER CAME UP TO ME, AND HE SAID -- MY UNCLE HAD PASSED AND HE SAID, "I SAW THE PAPER TODAY." HE GOES, "IT'S ON ME." [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Jimmy: COME ON.
AND I WAS JUST LIKE --
Jimmy: PEOPLE LIKE THAT, REAL PEOPLE.
IT WAS JUST AMAZING, ANYWAY.
Jimmy: PEOPLE CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER. NO, I LOVE THAT.
I KNOW.
ARE WE GETTING TO GO BACK THERE FOR THE HOLIDAYS AND A A FAMILY GET-TOGETHER?
YES.
Jimmy: WHAT DOES THE HOLMES FAMILY DO? WHAT DO THEY DO? ANY TRADITIONS?
WELL, WE AREN'T MUSICALLY INCLINED BY NATURE. BUT, OVER THE HOLIDAYS, IT REALLY COMES OUT AND WE DO THE "12 DAYS OF CHRISTMAS." AND THERE ARE A BUNCH OF US. AND MY SISTER, BECAUSE SHE'S THE OLDEST, ALWAYS GETS THE FIVE GOLDEN RINGS.
Jimmy: IT'S THE BEST PART, YEAH.
IT'S THE BEST.
Jimmy: YOU GOT TO GIVE THAT TO HER.
YOU HAVE TO, AND I GET WHATEVER'S LEFT OVER BECAUSE I'M THE BABY. AND WE TEND TO CALL PEOPLE AND SING TO THEM.

Jimmy: YEAH, I'LL JUST DO THAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I LOVE THIS IDEA. ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA SET -- THAT'S GOING TO BE A TRADITION OF MINE. WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR MOVIE. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. YOU DIRECTED A MOVIE.

Jimmy: DID YOU LIKE DOING IT? DID YOU ENJOY IT?
I LOVED IT
Jimmy: YOU DID? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I LOVED IT. YES, YES.
Jimmy: IT'S CALLED "ALL WE HAD." IT'S CALLED "ALL WE HAD," AND IT'S A MOTHER/DAUGHTER STORY.
YES. IT'S A -- IT'S A MOTHER/DAUGHTER STORY, BUT IT'S -- THEY HAVE A VERY UNTRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIP. SO THEY'RE ALMOST LIKE SISTERS. AND THEY'RE KIND OF BEST FRIENDS, AND THEY'RE TWO GIRLS ON THE ROAD SURVIVING. AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. I HAD AN INCREDIBLE TEAM AROUND ME. I HAD A WONDERFUL CINEMATOGRAPHER NAMED BRETT POLLACK, A WONDERFUL PRODUCTION DESIGNER, MICHAEL FITZGERALD. IT WAS PRODUCED BY JANE ROSENTHAL. AND THE CAST, WE HAD A GREAT CAST, LUKE WILSON.
Jimmy: OH, LUKE WILSON'S GREAT.
HE'S SO FUNNY.
Jimmy: NO, I LOVE HIM. HE'S FUN ON OUR SHOW. HE'S HILARIOUS. IT'S GREAT.
YES.
Jimmy: BUT THIS IS A BIG DEAL. I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WORK GOES INTO, LIKE, DIRECTING? I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
IT WAS SCARY.
Jimmy: I COULD NEVER DO IT. I WOULD BE LIKE, I DON'T KNOW. JUST DO WHATEVER. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, IT'S NOT TRUE. IT'S NOT TRUE. YOU WORK SO HARD.
Jimmy: NO.
YOU WORK SO, SO HARD.

WE HAD A GREAT TIME BECAUSE -- I MEAN, I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS, LUCKILY, FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS NOW, AND I LOVE BEING ON A HAPPY SET. AND I LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY VALUE ME AND, LIKE, THINK I'M GOOD.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO, I WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT FOR MY ACTORS. AND SO THAT REQUIRED, LIKE, I HAD GREAT FRIENDS. MY FRIEND JULIE WOULD ALWAYS BRING, LIKE, CAKES AND COOKIES AND LUNCH BECAUSE I ALWAYS THINK THAT YOU NEED TO BE WELL-FED.
Jimmy: FOOD IS GREAT.
AND IT WAS AN INDEPENDENT MOVIE, SO IT WAS, LIKE, WE NEED LOTS OF FOOD. AND --
Jimmy: IT'S A LOT OF WORK FOR NO MONEY. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, EXACTLY. AND THEN, I MEAN, BEYONCE, EVERY MORNING.
Jimmy: SHE WOULD COME TO THE SET?
I MEAN, NOT REALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IN SPIRIT.
Jimmy: OH, YOU WOULD PLAY MUSIC?
WE WOULD PLAY HER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S SO NICE. OF COURSE SHE WOULD COME SEE KATIE HOLMES."
OF COURSE.
Jimmy: "OF COURSE BEYONCE WOULD COME EVERY DAY BRINGING CUPCAKES." IT WAS LIKE, "WHAT?"
WE'D HAVE COFFEE.
Jimmy: IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN ON MY MOVIE. YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH.
WE'D GO THROUGH THE SCENE.
Jimmy: OH, SO YOU WOULD HAVE, LIKE, FUN DANCE PARTIES AND STUFF?
YES, BECAUSE THIS MOVIE, IT'S A MOTHER/DAUGHTER STORY, AND THERE'S A LOT OF HIGH EMOTIONS. AND FIRST OF ALL, I MEAN, THAT'S INTENSE.
Jimmy: YOU GOT TO KEEP THE VIBE.
SO YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME FUN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO WE DID A LOT OF "DRUNK IN LOVE."
Jimmy: YEAH.
