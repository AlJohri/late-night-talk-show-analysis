[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE WILL FERRELL ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA, ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. SECURITY IS VERY TIGHT BACKSTAGE. BEFORE I CAME OUT, THIS ONE GUY SPENT LIKE FIVE MINUTES PATTING ME DOWN. AND THEN SECRET SERVICE SHOWED UP AND SAID, "WHO IS THAT GUY THAT GUY GROPING FALLON?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND I GO, "UH, SORRY?" YEAH. JUST WARN ME NEXT TIME. LET'S SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON. ON TUESDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA HOSTED A WHITE HOUSE SCREENING OF THE NEW MOVIE "THE MONUMENT'S MEN." OR AS BIDEN CALLED IT, NOT "THE LEGO MOVIE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, LIKE EVERYONE RIGHT NOW, I GOT OLYMPIC FEVER. DO YOU HAVE OLYMPIC FEVER? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I GOT IT. IT'S SO FUN TO WATCH THE ATHLETES, THEY ARE ALL GREAT. BUT THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE A LOT GOING ON IN THEIR MINDS RIGHT BEFORE THEY GO ON. AND EVEN SOMETIMES WHEN THEY ARE PERFORMING. I WILL SHOW WHAT YOU I MEAN IN A SEGMENT CALLED "OLYMPIC THOUGHTS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: YOU GUYS MIGHT NOT REALIZE THIS, BUT I'M BASICALLY A MIND-READER. I DON'T LIKE TO BRAG ABOUT IT, BUT I CAN ACTUALLY TELL WHAT SOMEONE IS THINKING JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OLYMPIC ATHLETES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WOW! WOW!
Jimmy: LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PHOTO. HERE WE HAVE THIS INTERESTING MOMENT FROM THE RUSSIA/NORWAY HOCKEY GAME. AND I CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT THE GOALIE, THAT HE'S THINKING, "ALL THOSE YEARS OF PRACTICE ARE REALLY PAYING OFF." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THE OTHER PLAYER IS THINKING, "ALL THOSE YEARS OF PLAYING QUIDDITCH AT HOGWARTS ARE REALLY PAYING OFF." [ APPLAUSE ] FLYING HOLDING UP --
Steve: A QUIDDITCH STICK.
Jimmy: LET'S SEE ANOTHER ONE HERE. THIS LOOKS INTENSE. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS A LUGING TEAM MID-RACE.
Steve: MID-RACE.
Jimmy: I CAN READ THEIR --
Steve: CAN YOU REALLY?
Jimmy: WHAT I'M SAYING IS, I DON'T LIKE TO BRAG, BUT I CAN TELL WHAT THEY ARE THINKING JUST BY LOOKING AT THAT PHOTO.
Steve: REALLY? YES?
Jimmy: THE GUY AT THE BOTTOM --
Steve: YES? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S THINKING, "I'M SO EXCITED TO BE COMPETING IN THE OLYMPICS." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: THAT'S WHAT HE'S THINKING.
Jimmy: THAT'S CORRECT. AND THE GUY ON TOP IS THINKING, "YEAH, I CAN TELL." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S THE BREATH, THE HEART RATE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT -- BUT HE CAN FEEL IT. IT IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE.
Steve: EXACTLY.
Jimmy: LET'S KEEP GOING. HERE WE HAVE A SPEEDSKATER MOMENTS AFTER A RACE. I CAN TELL THAT HE'S THINKING, "I CAN'T BELIEVE I FORGOT TO DVR 'SCANDAL!'" [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A GREAT SHOW. HERE'S THE LAST ONE HERE. THIS IS TWO FIGURE SKATERS MID-ROUTINE. I CAN TELL THE WOMAN IS THINKING, "I SEE JUDGES FROM ENGLAND AND FRANCE." [ LAUGHTER ] THE MAN IS THINKING, "I SEE SOMEONE'S UNDERPANTS." [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, GROW UP! GROW UP! IMMATURE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: A NEW REPORT JUST CAME OUT THAT SOME COMPANIES, ESPECIALLY TECH COMPANIES, ARE NOT HIRING ENOUGH FEMALE EMPLOYEES. THE GUYS WHO RUN TECH COMPANIES SAY THAT THEY'D LOVE TO HIRE MORE WOMEN, OR TALK TO THEM, OR MEET THEM, OR EVEN SEE ONE UP CLOSE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ANYTHING? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? CAN I TWEET A PHOTOGRAPH OF US?
Jimmy: I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS. IT WAS REVEALED THIS WEEK THAT SANDRA BULLOCK AND GEORGE CLOONEY WERE NOT THE FIRST CHOICES TO STAR IN THE MOVIE "GRAVITY." I MEAN, WHO SAID NO? GOD AND OPRAH? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN THEY'RE THE TWO BIGGEST -- THEY WERE FANTASTIC. LITTLE BIT OF A SCANDAL HERE. THERE'S A DEAF COMPOSER JAPAN WHO HAS BEEN CALLED THE JAPANESE BEETHOVEN, JUST ADMITTED THAT HE CAN ACTUALLY HEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT DEAF AT ALL. AND STEVIE WONDER SAID, "YEAH, HE COULD TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT HIM. I MEAN HEAR -- HEARING HIM. JUST BY HEARING IN HIM, YOU KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT -- HE WAS LYING. BYE. [ APPLAUSE ] I JUST SKYPED, I MEAN CALLED -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, THIS IS PRETTY CRAZY. TWO MEN IN TEXAS WERE IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK WHEN THEY CRASHED THEIR CAR INTO A CONVENIENCE STORE AND THEN ROBBED IT. BUT I WAS PRETTY SURPRISED WHEN I HEARD WHAT THEY STOLE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
AND IN TEXAS, ANOTHER BOLD SMASH-AND-GRAB, BUT THESE TWO ROBBERS WEREN'T QUITE AS AMBITIOUS. THEY CRASHED INTO A CONVENIENCE STORE NEAR HOUSTON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BUT THEY APPARENTLY WANTED ONLY ONE THING. A CASE OF BEER. [ LAUGHTER ]

OUR GOOD BUDDY, WILL FERRELL IS DROPPING BY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND WE HAVE MUSIC FROM ARCADE FIRE. OH, MAN, THE WHOLE SHOW -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IF YOU'RE NOT DVR'ING IT, YOU SHOULD DO IT RIGHT NOW. AS YOU KNOW I LOVE WATCHING TV. A BIG FAN OF TELEVISION. I LOVE "THE WALKING DEAD." I LOVE "HOUSE OF CARDS." "THE VOICE" COMING BACK. CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT. THERE'S SO MANY GOOD SHOWS BUT THERE'S ONE SHOW THAT I'M TOTALLY INTO RIGHT NOW. AND IT IS ON TEEN NICK. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S CALLED "EW." [ CROWD EWS ] A LOT OF PEOPLE EVEN SAY THAT I LOOK LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER. I DON'T KNOW IF I SEE IT, THOUGH. ALSO, SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT A NICE THING TO SAY TO HER, THAT SHE LOOKS LIKE A 40-YEAR-OLD MAN. BUT VERY -- I'M JUST A BIG FAN. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK WE LOOK ALIKE. JUST -- YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK FOR YOURSELF. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

Jimmy: THEY ARE? THEY DON'T WATCH THAT MUCH TV?
I TRY NOT TO --

I AM SO SERIOUS. DAD, PLEASE, JUST DON'T COME TO MY SCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST KEEP YOUR S.W.A.T. TEAM AND YOUR --
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND YOU KNOW, THEY REALLY WANT NORMALCY AND THE WHITE HOUSE ISN'T NORMAL. SO THEY GO OTHER PLACES. AND SO I'LL SAY, DON'T YOU WANT TO INVITE YOUR FRIENDS OVER TO WATCH A MOVIE? SHE'S LIKE, NO ONE WANTS TO COME HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE --
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH. I WOULD BE LIKE, MOM, WE NEED TO GET HARRY STYLES TO COME HERE RIGHT NOW. YOU HAVE TO CALL HIM AND FLY HIM IN FROM ENGLAND.
SHE IS JUST THE OPPOSITE BECAUSE THEY REALLY WANT TO BE NORMAL. AND AS TEENAGERS, ALL OF THIS WHITE HOUSE STUFF, THE PRESIDENT STUFF.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T GET IT.
THAT'S LIKE, OH, GOSH.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT NORMAL, YEAH. ARE THEY DRIVING?
YOU KNOW, MALIA WILL BE. SHE IS GOING TO TURN 16 THIS SUMMER. SO WE ARE KIND OF DEALING WITH THAT.
Jimmy: HOPEFULLY SHE TAKES THE STRETCH LIMO, RIGHT? THAT IS THE PRESIDENTIAL LIMO THAT SHE'S DRIVING AROUND.
I DON'T THINK WE'LL LET HER HAVE THAT. I MEAN, AGAIN, ONE OF THE THINGS I TOLD MY STAFF, I'VE TOLD SECRET SERVICE, IS THAT WHEN WE'RE OUT OF HERE IN A FEW YEARS, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO FUNCTION AS NORMAL PEOPLE. AND SO DRIVING IS A PART OF THAT. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IN D.C., WATCH OUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
MALIA OBAMA ON THE ROAD. KIND OF FRIGHTENING. I HAVE SECURITY, SO I'M GOOD.
Jimmy: YOU'RE GOOD, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] THE OLYMPICS ARE HAPPENING. I HAVE TO ASK YOU, OF COURSE AS THE FIRST LADY, ARE YOU WATCHING THE OLYMPICS?
ABSOLUTELY. I'M WATCHING IT EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.
Jimmy: IT IS AMAZING, RIGHT?
YES, IT'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE EVENT? DO YOU HAVE ONE?
FIGURE SKATING, AS I SAID ON "EW."
Jimmy: SO GOOD. I WAS WATCHING IT LAST NIGHT.
AND I LIKE SKIING, SO I LOVE TO WATCH THEM SHOOT DOWN THAT MOUNTAIN.
Jimmy: ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRY?
YOU KNOW, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WINTER SPORTS IS ONE OF THOSE -- THE OLYMPICS IS LIKE, THERE'S NOTHING THAT I COULD DO BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS ON SNOW AND ICE. I MEAN, JUST THINK ABOUT THE PAIRS, THE FIGURE SKATING.
Jimmy: OH NO.
YOU KNOW THERE'S A SIX FOOT MAN TAKING A 100 POUND GIRL AND SLINGING HER ACROSS THE -- I'M LIKE, "I WANT NO PARTS TO THAT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS SAFE. LOOKS REALLY DANGEROUS.
YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY DID THAT I'D BE LIKE, "DON'T FLING ME ACROSS THE ICE LIKE THAT. DON'T DO THAT."
Jimmy: I'M WEARING BLADES ON MY FEET.
IT'S LIKE AND THEN THEY GOT TO LAND ON ONE FOOT. NO EVERYTHING THEY DO IS DANGEROUS. BOBSLEDDING. IT'S ALL JUST SO -- NO.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
I JUST WANT TO WATCH.
Jimmy: IT'S SO MUCH BETTER TO WATCH. I AGREE WITH YOU. THE OLYMPICS ARE KIND OF THE ULTIMATE LET'S MOVE TO BE A BLUNT SEGUE INTO THAT. THE LET'S MOVE INITIATIVE, YOU STARTED THIS FOUR YEARS AGO?
WE ARE YOU CELEBRATING OUR FOURTH ANNIVERSARY AND YOU HAVE BEEN A PART OF IT EVERY YEAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I WAS THERE. FIRST YEAR. I'M SO HAPPY. WE'LL DO ANYTHING. WE LOVE IT. I LOVE THE IDEA, AND NOW YOU ARE DOING A NEW PART OF THIS INITIATIVE, WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO ASK PEOPLE HOW THEY MOVE.
YEAH, ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALIZED OVER FOUR YEARS IS THERE IS A NEW NORM GOING ON. YOU KNOW WHEN WE TOOK THIS ISSUE OVER THERE A LOT PEOPLE WHO WERE CRITICAL THAT YOU KNOW, YOU COULDN'T TALK ABOUT OBESITY. THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE AN ISSUE. BUT NOW OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN CHANGING. SO, THE DAY OF A CHILD'S LIFE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE BEGINNING TO END. DAY CARE CENTERS ARE CHANGING WHAT THEY FEED KIDS. THEY ARE GETTING THEM UP AND MOVING. SCHOOLS HAVE NEW LUNCH STANDARDS. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE GETTING KIDS ENGAGED. SO I CAN SEE SOME OF THESE THINGS BUT I CAN'T SEE EVERYTHING. SO WHAT WE ASK PEOPLE TO DO IS SHOW US HOW YOU'RE MOVING. WE WANT PEOPLE TO FACEBOOK IT. TWEET IT. ALL THAT.
Jimmy: INSTAGRAM IT.
INSTAGRAM IT. THE HASHTAG IS #LETSMOVE. AND I WANT TO SEE HOW PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE MOVING AND CHANGING THE STANDARDS FOR HEALTH FOR OUR KIDS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DOING SOME AMAZING THINGS. AND THE FUN THING IS, IS THAT IF WE GET ENOUGH OF A RESPONSE, WE WILL HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE. THE PRESIDENT AND MAYBE THE VICE PRESIDENT WILL SHOW US HOW THEY MOVE. BUT WE GOTTA GET -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE WANT TO SEE THAT. WE CAN DO THAT. #LETSMOVE.
I GOT A LITTLE PULL.
Jimmy: NO YOU GOT A LITTLE PULL. IS MY THING.
Jimmy: EXACTLY.
YO, BABE, HOOK ME UP.
Jimmy: HOOK ME UP. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] FUN, FUN, FUN. WHILE YOU'RE HERE, I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU -- I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. MARCH, IS THERE A DEADLINE?
THE END OF MARCH, ABSOLUTELY, YES IT IS.
Jimmy: BECAUSE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WATCH OUR SHOW. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL ME -- WHY WOULD THEY -- BECAUSE A LOT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND ON THIS.
THANKS TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, YOUNG PEOPLE CAN STAY ON THEIR PARENTS' INSURANCE UNTIL THEY ARE 26. BUT ONCE THEY HIT 26, THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN AND A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE INVINCIBLE. BUT THE TRUTH IS, YOUNG PEOPLE ARE KNUCKLE HEADS. YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE COOKING FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SLICE THEIR FINGER OPEN. THEY ARE DANCING ON THE BAR STOOL.
Jimmy: YOUNG PEOPLE. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD NEVER DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS JUST LAST SUMMER. NO, NO, NO.
BUT WHILE YOUNG PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE INVINCIBLE, THEY'RE NOT. YOU KNOW, LIFE HAPPENS. AND AS A MOTHER, AND I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF MOMS OUT THERE WHO WORRY THAT THEIR KIDS ARE GOING TO, YOU KNOW, HAVE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT, GET A BAD DIAGNOSIS AND THEY WON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE. AND BEFORE, THEY COULDN'T GET IT BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT. AND NOW YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GET INSURANCE FOR AS LITTLE AS $50 A MONTH, LESS THAN THE COST OF GYM SHOES. AND, YOU KNOW, FOR MOMS AND DADS WHO ARE OUT THERE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR KIDS, WE WANT YOU TO ENCOURAGE YOUR KIDS TO SIGN UP FOR THAT PEACE OF MIND THAT WE ALL LOOK FOR.
Jimmy: HEALTHCARE.GOV IS THE WEBSITE IF YOU HAVEN'T READ ABOUT IT IN THE NEWS OR ANYTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. IT'S UP AND RUNNING.
IT'S WORKING!
Jimmy: IT'S WORKING NOW. [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S SO MUCH BETTER WHEN IT'S WORKING.
IT HELPS. THAT HELPS.
Jimmy: WE'RE LINKING TO "TONIGHT SHOW" VIDEOS. WELL CHANGE IT. NO, WE WON'T. SINCE YOU'RE THE FIRST LADY, I WANTED TO ASK YOU A COUPLE FIRSTS.
SOME FIRSTS?
Jimmy: QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME FIRSTS OF YOURS.
OKAY.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD. ALRIGHT, READY? FIRST MEAL YOU EVER COOKED YOURSELF.
OH, GOSH. I'M SURE IT WAS SOME PASTA DISH. NOT RAMEN NOODLES.
Jimmy: THAT WAS MY FIRST. THAT WAS MY FIRST, RAMEN NOODLES.
NO, I ACTUALLY BOILED SOME PASTA.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I DO WITH RAMEN NOODLES. THEN ADD A LITTLE ASIAN SPICES. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. IT'S LIKE GOING TO EPCOT. IT'S LIKE GOING AROUND THE WORLD. IN YOUR TEETH, YEAH. JUST PASTA WITH SAUCE?
PASTA, PROBABLY -- I'M 50, I'M OLD. I CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH. BUT PROBABLY LIKE MAC AND CHEESE. THAT WAS ONE OF MY BIG -- YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S ADVANCED.
MAC AND CHEESE CASSEROLE IS PRETTY SIMPLE.
Jimmy: IT'S MORE THAN TWO INGREDIENTS. I'M IN RAMEN NOODLE AREA. CAN THE PRESIDENT COOK?
YEAH, HE CAN ACTUALLY.
Jimmy: REALLY?
HE DOESN'T, BUT HE CAN. [ LAUGHTER ] HE CLAIMS -- THAT'S THE ONE THING. I CAN COOK. HE'S COOKED LIKE, YOU KNOW, FIVE TIMES FOR ME. HE'S GONNA BE MAD THAT I SAID THAT.
Jimmy: HE'S ALLOWED TO GET UPSET.
BUT HE CAN COOK. HE CAN COOK.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST JOB?
MY FIRST JOB WAS IN A BOOK BINDERY. YEAH, LET ME TELL YOU --
Jimmy: HOW OLD ARE YOU? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS A BOOK BINDERY? A BOOK BINDERY? WHAT IS THIS LIKE KEN BURNS DOCUMENTARY? [ LAUGHTER ]
WE CHOPPED DOWN THE TREES.
Jimmy: A BOOK BINDERY.
WELL THIS IS THE PLACE THEY MADE THE FOLDERS, YOU KNOW, THE NOTEBOOKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, SURE.
AND THIS WAS THE JOB THAT SENT ME STRAIGHT TO COLLEGE. BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU, I DID THIS IN HIGH SCHOOL. IT WAS THE KIND OF JOB WHERE, YOU KNOW, MY FIRST DAY THEY GAVE ME THE TASK OF TAKING A METAL CLIP AND PUTTING IT IN A HOLE AND THEN PASSING IT TO THE NEXT PERSON. AND I DID THAT ALL DAY. AND I DID IT FAST. I WASN'T THE KIND OF KID THAT WAS LIKE, "OKAY, I'M GOING TO SIT HERE ALL DAY AND I'M GOING TO FINISH THE JOB BECAUSE I'M GOING TO FINISH ALL OF THIS." WELL I DID THAT FOR LIKE TWO WEEKS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
TAKING THE METAL THINGS, PUTTING IT IN THE HOLE.
Jimmy: CLOCK IS TICKING AND YOU'RE LIKE, "I'M GONNA SNAP! I'M GONNA SNAP!"
I SAID, I'M GOING TO COLLEGE. BUT THE OTHER THING IT TAUGHT ME WAS THE RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK EVERYDAY IN JOBS THAT THEY ARE NOT PASSIONATE ABOUT. THEY DO WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. THEY ARE ON TIME. IT REMINDED ME OF MY DAD, YOU KNOW? I MEAN WORKING CLASS FOLKS THAT ARE DOING JOBS THAT AREN'T THAT FUN BUT IT PAYS THE BILLS. SO IT SHOWED ME THE RESPECT I NEEDED TO HAVE FOR FOLKS WHO WORK EVERYDAY AND IT SENT ME STRAIGHT TO COLLEGE.
Jimmy: IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE BAD, YOU CAN'T APPRECIATE THE GOOD SOMETIMES. [ APPLAUSE ] THIS ONE IS MORE OF A FUN ONE. DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR FIRST SCHOOL DANCE?
OH, YEAH, YEAH. I WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL KID. BUT THERE WAS A CATHOLIC SCHOOL AROUND THE CORNER, AN ALL GIRLS SCHOOL THAT USED TO HAVE DANCES. AND I WENT TO THOSE BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO TO AN ALL GIRLS' SCHOOL DANCE, THE GUYS ARE THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY CAME?
THEY SHOW UP.
Jimmy: THEY SHOW UP.
YEAH, IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SCHOOL GYM DANCES. YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, THERE WAS SO MUCH PRESSURE FOR ME. WE HAD LIKE A CYO, I THINK IT WAS LIKE A ROLLER SKATING SLASH DANCE.
OH, THAT'S TOO MUCH. YOU HAD TO ROLLER SKATE AND DANCE?
Jimmy: I WAS SO NERVOUS. I REMEMBER JUST GOING AND WAIT FOR THE CLOCK TO TICK AND BE LIKE, I THINK MY DAD SHOULD BE OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TAKE CARE GUYS. JUST TAKE OFF.
YOU DIDN'T ASK ANYONE TO DANCE?
Jimmy: I DID AND MY HANDS WERE SO SWEATY.
OH, YOU WERE ONE OF THE SWEATY ONES?
Jimmy: NO, BUT I'M NOT! [ LAUGHTER ] NO, I'M NOT A SWEATY ONE! NO! I'M NOT ONE OF THE SWEATY ONES!
OH, MAN, JIMMY.
Jimmy: I HAVE WORKING MAN'S HANDS! I HAVE REALLY TOUGH GUY HANDS. I SWEAR. I WAS NERVOUS AS HECK. I CAN'T DO IT NOW.

HE DID ALTERNATE TAKES AND WE HAD -- ORIGINALLY, THE MOVIE WAS FOUR HOURS LONG. AND THEY PLAYED AROUND AND THOUGHT ABOUT SPLITTING IT INTO TWO MOVIES. BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK. SO WE JUST HAD A SECOND EDITOR WORKING THE WHOLE TIME WITH ALTERNATIVE JOKES. SO IT'S THE SAME MOVIE. IT'S 20 MINUTES LONGER. THERE'S A MUSICAL NUMBER WE HAD TO CUT FROM THE ORIGINAL ONE. LITTLE TREATS LIKE THAT. AND IT'LL BE OUT FOR A WEEK.
Jimmy: FEBRUARY 28TH.
28th. FEBRUARY 28th.
Jimmy: IT'S DISTRACTING WHEN YOU KEEP DOING THAT. IT MUST BOTHER YOU. BECAUSE, A LOT OF EXTRA HAND GESTURES THAT YOU NORMALLY WOULDN'T DO, IF YOU CAME ON THE SHOW.
THE FACT THAT I'M WEARING -- [ LAUGHTER ] THE FACT THAT I'M WEARING WHITE GLOVES HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER I'M DOING MORE GESTURES OR NOT. I'M DOING THE SAME AMOUNT OF GESTURES. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. YOU KNOW, WITH THE TRAINED EYE, I'M A VERY DEMONSTRATIVE PERSON. AND THIS IS -- THIS IS ME.
