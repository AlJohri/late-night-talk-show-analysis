WHY DID YOU -- YOU FELT LIKE YOU HAD TO KEEP IT ON BECAUSE IT WAS SO GENEROUS OF HIM.
Jimmy: YEAH. I KIND OF LAUGHED IT OFF, AND KINDA TRIED TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT --
HE TOOK HIS SHIRT OFF AND GIVE IT AWAY, GIVE IT AWAY, GIVE IT AWAY, NOW.
Jimmy: OH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: RETIRING. TAKE CARE BUDDY! HE'S RETIRING. NO, HE'S BACK, HE'S BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU RETIRED FROM SHOW BUSINESS, AND YOU CAME BACK.
I CAME BACK IT WAS A QUICK RETIREMENT. I FIGURED I MISSED THE SPOTLIGHT. AND THE ENERGY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU MISSED THE BUSINESS.
I HAVE MORE TO DO.
Jimmy: YES, YOU DO HAVE MORE TO DO. YOU HAVE MUCH MORE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE NEW MOVIE. IT IS VERY INTERESTING, THIS MOVIE. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT, BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
QUEST. QUEST IS EXCITED FOR IT.
Questlove: YEAH, I AM.
Jimmy: DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS MOVIE?
Questlove: I KNOW ABOUT IT, YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S CALLED "TUSK." LIKE A TUSK, LIKE A WALRUS WOULD HAVE A TUSK.
YEAH.
Jimmy: NOW, THAT'S A TYPE OF TUSK. NOW THE IDEA IS. A MAN -- YOU WANT TO TELL IT?
IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOVIES WHERE A MAN TURNS ANOTHER MAN INTO A WALRUS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY, THAT RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT WHOLE CHESTNUT.
Jimmy: HE'S NOT KIDDING. HE'S NOT KIDDING. I HAVE A CLIP. DO YOU WANT TO SET IT UP AT ALL? OR YOU'RE TRAPPED, TRYING TO GET SOMEONE TO SAVE YOU.
AT THIS POINT, HE IS CUT OFF. HE'S BEGUN THE PROCESS OF SEWING ME EVENTUALLY INTO THIS WALRUS COSTUME.
Jimmy: HE SEWS YOU INTO IT?
WELL YOU'LL SEE. I DON'T WANNA -- SPOILER ALERT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, HE CUTS OFF MY LEG AND OBVIOUSLY I AM FREAKING OUT.
Jimmy: CUTS YOUR LEG OFF?
WELL IN ORDER TO GET IN A A WALRUS SUIT, HOW DO YOU IT? [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU KEEP ALL YOUR LIMBS WHEN YOU WEAR A WALRUS SUIT?
Jimmy: I THOUGHT IT WAS A A FUN, I THOUGHT IT WAS A A WALRUS WITH LIKE, LEGS. [ LAUGHTER ]
JIMMY.
Jimmy: LIKE A TIMES SQUARE WALRUS. LIKE WAVING. [ LAUGHTER ]
HEY, KIDS!
Jimmy: HEY! CUT YOUR LEG OFF?
YEAH.
Jimmy: ARE YOU WEARING THE WE HAVE A CLIP, HERE IS JUSTIN LONG IN "TUSK."

IT'S HILARIOUS. WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING FOR?
Jimmy: "I DON'T WANT TO DIE. I DON'T WANT TO DIE IN CANADA." OH MY GOSH. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: YEAH IT'S REALLY FUNNY FOR ME. [ LAUGHTER ] JUSTIN LONG. "TUSK" IS IN THEATERS SEPTEMBER 19th. HE'S THE BEST. THANK YOU, BROTHER. WE HAVE STANDUP FROM KURT BRAUNOHLER AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

OUR NEXT GUEST THIS EVENING IS A VERY FUNNY COMEDIAN WHO RECENTLY JET SKIED FROM CHICAGO TO NEW ORLEANS TO RAISE MONEY FOR CHARITY. [ CHEERS ] WE CAN SEE THAT AND MORE IN HIS SPECIAL, "ROUSTABOUT," THIS FALL ON COMEDY CENTRAL STUDIOS. PLEASE GIVE IT UP FOR KURT BRAUNOHLER! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU! THANK YOU. GOD, THIS IS SO EXCITING. WOO! [ CHEERS ] I'VE HAD SUCH AN EXCITING YEAR. I FEEL LIKE I LEARNED A LOT THIS YEAR, YOU KNOW? LIKE I RECENTLY LEARNED A VERY VALUABLE LESSON, WHICH IS DON'T EVER RACE A DUDE WHO'S DRIVING A PT CRUISER. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE THAT MAN HAS GOT NOTHING TO LOSE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE IS AT THE END OF HIS ROPE. YOU LET HIM BE! ALSO, I LEARNED THAT I DON'T LIKE BISCOTTI. AND THAT'S OKAY! OH, WHAT DO I WANT TO CHEW ON ROCKS AND NURSE MOUTH WOUNDS FOR WEEKS? NO! NO, I DO NOT! BUT PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE BISCOTTI ARE LIKE, "OH, YOU JUST GOT TO SOAK IT IN SOME COFFEE FIRST." YOU KNOW WHAT? SCREW YOUR FOOD, THAT REQUIRES ME TO GIVE IT A HOT BATH BEFORE YOU EAT IT. SCREW YOU, BISCOTTI. I'M HAPPY TO BE IN NEW YORK. I USED TO LIVE HERE. AND WHEN I WAS HERE I WAS SINGLE, AND NOT DOING TOO WELL AT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I USED TO JUST GO TO DOG PARKS BY MYSELF ALL THE TIME. NOT BECAUSE I HAD A DOG, BUT BECAUSE I LOVED TO CREEPILY STARE AT OTHER PEOPLE'S DOGS. SO ONE DAY I WAS AT THE DOG PARK, AND I SAW THIS DOG. HE WAS MAKING LOVE TO THIS OTHER DOG. AND THE WOMAN WHO OWNED THE DOG DOING THE HUMPING JUST WENT, "OH, NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT'S A BAD IDEA." AND SHE JUST REACHED DOWN AND GRABBED HIM BY HIS HARNESS AND LIFTED HIM OFF MID-HUMP. AND THEN, HE JUST CONTINUED TO HUMP MIDAIR. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, SHE PUT HIM DOWN. HE KIND OF LIKE HUMP WALKED AWAY. I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S AMAZING!" [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I WISH THAT I HAD HAD THAT IN MY LIFE WHEN I WAS SINGLE. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST LIKE A GIANT HAND THAT WOULD REACH DOWN FROM THE SKY AND INTERCEDE WHEN I WAS MAKING BAD CHOICES IN MY LIFE. LIKE, "OH, NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT'S A BAD IDEA. SHE'S INCREDIBLY EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE. UH-HUH." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "OH, NO, NO, NO. HER MAROON 5 T-SHIRT IS NOT IRONIC." [ LAUGHTER ] "OH, SHE'S GOT MORE CATS THAN TOES." [ AUDIENCE OHS ] WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION, DOES SHE HAVE 11 CATS OR HAS SHE LOST TOES? [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS RECENTLY IN LONDON. AND I LIKE THE BRITISH PEOPLE, LIKE I DO. I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE ROYAL FAMILY. LIKE I THINK I GOT SUSPICIOUS OF THEM EVER SINCE THEY KNIGHTED MIX-A-LOT. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO I AM STAYING IN THIS FLAT IN LONDON. I WANT TO WASH MY CLOTHES, AND SO I PUT MY CLOTHES INTO THIS WASHING MACHINE. NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE EVER SEEN A U.K. WASHING MACHINE. BUT THERE ARE NO WORDS ON IT. IT'S JUST A SERIES OF TRIANGLES AND SQUIGGLES. IT'S VERY CONFUSING. I FINALLY GET IT TO WASH MY CLOTHES, AND IT PROCEEDS TO WASH MY CLOTHES FOR 24 HOURS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND AFTER WASHING THE CRAP OUT OF THESE CLOTHES, IT LOCKS MY CLOTHES INSIDE OF ITSELF FOR THREE DAYS. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE I CANNOT PHYSICALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPEN IT AT ALL. SO I CALL THE PEOPLE WE RENTED THE PLACE FROM. I'M LIKE, "HEY, MY CLOTHES ARE STUCK IN THIS WASHING MACHINE." AND I HEAR TYPING. SHE'S LIKE, "WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?" AND SHE'S LIKE, "OH, SIR, THERE'S WASHING MACHINES IN THE BASEMENT." AND I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I KNOW. I PUT THE CLOTHES IN THE WASHING MACHINE IN THE APARTMENT." AND SHE SAYS, "SIR! THERE IS NO WASHING MACHINE IN THE FLAT. WHAT DID YOU PUT YOUR CLOTHES INTO?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND I LOVE THIS QUESTION. BECAUSE THIS SUGGESTS THAT WHEN I WALK INTO AN APARTMENT JUST EVERYTHING IS A WASHING MACHINE TO ME. PUT MY CLOTHES IN THE OVEN, SET IT TO 500. I'M DONE! COME UP TO A WINDOW LIKE, "THIS IS A BIG WASHING MACHINE!" [ LAUGHTER ] TURNS OUT I PUT MY CLOTHES IN A A TRASH COMPACTOR. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: HEY, BUDDY. KURT, FANTASTIC, BUDDY. KURT BRAUNOHLER! KURT BRAUNOHLER! I HEARD THAT IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY TODAY. IS THAT TRUE?
