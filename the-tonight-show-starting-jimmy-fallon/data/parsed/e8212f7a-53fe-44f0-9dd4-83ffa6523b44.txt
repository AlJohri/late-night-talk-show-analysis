Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AS SOON AS I'M HERE EVERYTHING FEELS FINE.
Jimmy: BUT IT'S GETTING HERE?
YEAH AND THEN AFTERWARDS I ALWAYS LOOK BACK AND THINK, "THAT WAS FUN."
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT'S JUST THERE'S THIS ANTICIPATORY ANXIETY THAT I GUESS RELATES TO PUBLIC SPEAKING, WHICH SEEMS ODD REFERRING TO THIS AS THAT, BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT IS, REALLY.
Jimmy: IT'S PUBLIC, SURE. [ LAUGHTER ]
I REMEMBER AT ONE TIME I READ A POLL THAT SAID PUBLIC SPEAKING -- IT WAS A POLL OF PEOPLE'S FEARS. WHAT PEOPLE WERE MOST AFRAID OF. AND PUBLIC SPEAKING WAS EITHER NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO, NECK AND NECK WITH GETTING EATEN BY A SHARK. [ LAUGHTER ] TRULY.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: EATEN BY A SHARK HAPPENS SO MUCH FASTER.
WELL, THAT'S THE POINT. THAT'S WHAT I REALIZED. I WAS FILMING EARLIER TODAY. AND THEN I WENT HOME BEFORE COMING HERE AND SORT OF GOT IN THE TUB TO TRY AND GET WARM. HAS EVERYONE ELSE BEEN FREEZING FOR MONTHS?
Jimmy: IT'S TOO COLD. IT'S SO COLD.
RIGHT IN AND PAST THE ORGANS, RIGHT TO THE BONE, AND THEN JUST THERE FOR MONTHS.
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU GOT COLD BONES, MAN. WHICH IS A NEW SHOW ON NBC FOLLOWING "THE BLACKLIST." [ LAUGHTER ] "COLD BONES." YEAH, YOU GOTTA WATCH "COLD BONES."
GONNA BE GREAT. THURSDAY NIGHTS.
Jimmy: IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
ANYWAY, I WAS SITTING IN A A TUB AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS. I REALIZED, YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE ANY ANTICIPATION OF BEING EATEN BY A SHARK, THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE BEACH OR WAY INLAND. YOU WON'T ANTICIPATE IT AT ALL.
Jimmy: YOU WON'T BE IN THE AREA.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO BE IN THE AREA.
Jimmy: OH, I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS. BUT WITH PUBLIC SPEAKING, YOU'RE IN THE -- RIGHT NOW YOU'RE IN THE TANK. YOU'RE GOING TO GET EATEN BY A A SHARK.
SO I FEEL BETTER NOW. THE STOMACHACHE IS GONE.
Jimmy: IT'S GONE. THERE YOU GO. WE CURED YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE LOVE.
I GUESS WE'RE FINALLY HERE.
Jimmy: WE CURED YOU WITH LOVE. EVERY TIME YOU COME ON I ALWAYS ASK YOU TO TELL ME A NICE NEW YORK CITY STORY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE SO MANY GOOD STORIES AROUND THIS GREAT CITY. I WANT TO KNOW THIS TIME, JUST ANYTHING RANDOM. YOUR FIRST JOB.
OKAY. THE VERY FIRST JOB -- I CAME HERE WHEN I WAS 17. I DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. I COME FROM MASSACHUSETTS. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. THEY'VE BEEN STRANDED HERE BECAUSE OF THE SNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR MONTHS NOW. THAT'S GREAT. WE FEED THEM.
FEELS PRETTY WARM, DOESN'T IT?
Jimmy: YEAH. WE ALL GET IN THE TUB EVERY DAY BEFORE THE SHOW. IT'S FUN. WE LIKE HAVING THEM.
SO I MOVED HERE. I DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND I MOVED TO NEW YORK, AND I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO PROSPECTS. EXCEPT FOR A COMPLETE LACK OF FEAR. I MEAN, I REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANY SENSE THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING TO BE RETICENT ABOUT. I WAS READY TO SORT OF JUMP INTO ANY OF IT.
Jimmy: HOW OLD WERE YOU, 17?
17.
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE THAT CONFIDENCE --
WELL, IT WAS THE LATE '70s, SO WE WERE STONED TOO. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT ANYWAY, SO I CAME HERE AND I MOVED INTO AN APARTMENT WITH MY SISTER AND FIVE OR SIX OTHER PEOPLE. I SLEPT ON THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR. BUT ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS JOHN KENNEDY, JR. HE WAS A YEAR BEHIND ME. AND SO HE WAS STILL AT SCHOOL WHEN I CAME TO THE CITY. BUT HE WOULD COME DOWN EVERY SO OFTEN. IT WOULD BE SORT OF AN OASIS. I WOULD GO OVER TO HIS APARTMENT AND HIS MOTHER JACKIE ONASSIS WAS THERE. AND I REMEMBER WHEN I --
Jimmy: IN MASSACHUSETTS?
NO, NO, NO. FROM SCHOOL.
Jimmy: YEAH. TWO STUDS. TWO GOOD-LOOKING DUDES GET TOGETHER. LIKE, "YEAH, WE SHOULD BE FRIENDS." YEAH.
NOT AT ALL. BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY. LET'S JUST MAKE IT THAT STORY. YOU CAN FACT CHECK. YOU'RE A STUD. HE'S A STUD. YEAH. ALL RIGHT, YEAH. I REMEMBER I WAS OVER -- ONE OF THE FIRST WEEKS I WAS HERE I WAS OVER THERE AND SHE ASKED ME HOW THINGS WERE GOING. I SAID, "WELL, I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB." AND SHE SAID, "WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN?" I SAID, "ACTUALLY, I'D LOVE ANY ADVICE YOU COULD GIVE ME ABOUT -- OR ANY HELP YOU COULD GIVE ME IN TERMS OF FINDING A A JOB." I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY IN THE CITY EXCEPT FOR MY SISTER AND MY SISTER WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE HER WAY AS WELL. AND SHE SAID, "WHAT SORT OF JOB ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?" I SAID, WELL -- AT THAT TIME I EITHER WANTED TO BE SORT OF A A GANGSTER OR A PRIVATE DETECTIVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT? THAT'S NOT AN OCCUPATION FOR A A 17-YEAR-OLD KID.
WELL, I WAS --
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU WERE A A STONED 17-YEAR-OLD KID. "I THINK IT WAS YOU. YOU DID IT." NO, YOU'RE PLAYING "CLUE" ALL DAY. WITH A CANDLESTICK IN THE LIBRARY. [ LAUGHTER ]
I LOVED HUMPHREY BOGART MOVIES AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: THAT WAS AWESOME. SO SHE WAS LIKE, "I CAN'T HELP YOU, BUDDY."
"I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT AT ALL." BUT I SAID, "YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVE TO THE CITY, SOMETIMES GET RESTAURANT JOBS." YOU CAN SET YOUR OWN SCHEDULE WHILE YOU'RE PURSUING YOUR POSITION AS A GANGSTER OR PRIVATE DETECTIVE. YOU CAN HAVE A FLEXIBLE JOB THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GO ON MEETINGS FOR THOSE OTHER THINGS. SO I SAID MAYBE A RESTAURANT JOB. I NEVER WORKED IN A RESTAURANT BEFORE. SHE SAID, "OH, WELL, PERFECT." SHE SAID, "VASILIS, WHO WORKS HERE IN THE APARTMENT, HE ALSO WORKS PART-TIME AT A GREEK RESTAURANT. HE'S A GREEK GENTLEMAN. AND HE WORKS AT THIS GREEK RESTAURANT." THIS HUGE GREEK RESTAURANT CALLED SEA FARE OF THE AEGEAN ON 56th STREET, WHICH USED TO BE -- I THINK 56th OR 58th. USED TO BE SORT OF A RESTAURANT ROW THERE. AND YOU KNOW, RESTAURANTS WERE SORT OF LADIES WHO LUNCH WOULD GO FOR LUNCH. SO I DID THIS JOB FOR, I DON'T KNOW, A COUPLE MONTHS, A FEW MONTHS. AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THERE WAS THIS ONE DAY --THIS IS SORT OF THE END OF IT. AS I SAID, THERE WAS USUALLY BIG LUNCHES OF WOMEN. AND THERE WAS A TABLE, A BIG ROUND TABLE OF EIGHT OR NINE -- THIS IS GOING ON AND ON.
Jimmy: NO, NO. IT'S FASCINATING. [ LAUGHTER ]
THERE WAS THIS BIG TABLE --
Jimmy: I LOVE HAVING YOU HERE. I LOVE HEARING THESE STORIES. PLEASE.
OKAY. THERE'S THIS BIG TABLE OF EIGHT OR NINE WOMEN ALL SITTING AROUND THIS BIG ROUND TABLE. I HAD TO SHOW UP WITH A TRAY. A SETUP TRAY WITH LIKE ROLLS, BREADS, GLASSES OF WATER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
NINE OF THEM ON A BIG TRAY. AND I WAS NOT MUCH OF A BUSBOY. I HAD NEVER DONE IT BEFORE. AND I SHOWED UP WITH THIS TRAY AND I COME OVER TO THE TABLE, AND I'M TRYING TO BE VERY SAVOIR FAIRE. AND I SHOW UP WITH THE TRAY TO THE TABLE AND DUMP THE ENTIRE TRAY. THAT WAS THE END OF IT. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "GET OUT. YOU'RE FIRED. THAT'S IT." JACKIE ONASSIS GOT YOU YOUR FIRST JOB. THAT'S PRETTY AWESOME. BUT LOOK AT YOU NOW. YOU HAVE THIS AMAZING CAREER. NOW YOU'RE ON NBC'S GIANT -- THE BIGGEST HIT WE HAVE. "BLACKLIST." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
IT JUT CHANGED NIGHTS.
Jimmy: SAY WHAT?
IT JUST CHANGED NIGHTS. OH, I GUESS IT'S ON --
Jimmy: TONIGHT. IT JUST AIRED TONIGHT. OH, YEAH. IT WAS A GREAT EPISODE. DIDN'T YOU LOVE THE EPISODE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE EXCITED BECAUSE YOU'RE THE LEAD-IN FOR OUR SHOW. SO WHEN YOU DO WELL WE DO WELL. WE FOLLOWED YOU AT THE SUPER BOWL. BECAUSE IT WAS YOU -- THE SUPER BOWL, THEN YOU --
AND THEN YOU.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT WAS FANTASTIC.
