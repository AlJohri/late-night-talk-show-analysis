Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- CHRIS MELONI, LUKE BRYAN, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 309, BLOOMINGTON.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HEY! PLEASE, HEY! THAT WAS GREAT. TAKE A MINUTE. TAKE A MINUTE. HAVE A SEAT, WELCOME. WHAT A HOT CROWD THIS IS TONIGHT. COME ON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE LOVE YOU, JIMMY!
Jimmy: NOW WE'VE GOT TO PUT ON A GOOD SHOW. THAT'S THE ONLY PROBLEM. YEAH. YEAH, WE'LL DO IT.
Steve: TOO MUCH PRESSURE.
Jimmy: WE'LL DO IT. WELCOME, EVERYBODY, TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND I NEED YOU! WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER! THIS IS FANTASTIC. WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE SHOW. IT'S GOING TO BE FUN. NOW, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, THE FIGHT BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND MEGYN KELLY. AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF MAKING SEXIST COMMENTS ABOUT REPUBLICAN DEBATE MODERATOR MEGYN KELLY, TRUMP WENT ON CNN YESTERDAY AND SAID, "I CHERISH WOMEN, I WANT TO HELP WOMEN." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HILLARY WAS LIKE, "WELL, YOU'RE REALLY HELPING THIS WOMAN. SO, I'VE GOT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DOING A GREAT JOB. AND A TOP AIDE TO DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE QUIT THE CAMPAIGN THIS WEEKEND BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S PUBLIC FEUDS, BUT TRUMP SAID "HE WAS FIRED." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED WHAT HE WAS FIRED FOR, TRUMP SAID "QUITTING. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE FIRED FOR QUITTING, IT'S INEXCUSABLE." OF COURSE ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF LAST WEEK'S GOP DEBATE WAS WHEN DONALD TRUMP AND RAND PAUL GOT INTO A HEATED EXCHANGE. IT WAS FANTASTIC. CAN WE LOOK AT A SCREEN SHOT OF THAT? YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] IT GOT EVEN WEIRDER WHEN THEIR HAIRCUTS MATED AND THEY HAD A A LITTER OF GOLDENDOODLES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CAN WE SEE THE PICTURE AGAIN? THAT'S HOW -- THERE IT IS, YEAH. THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE GOLDENDOODLES.
Steve: THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEM.
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE THEM. OF COURSE, IN ADDITION TO THE PRIME-TIME DEBATE, THEY ALSO HELD AN EARLIER DEBATE ON FOX NEWS FOR SOME OF THE LOWER POLLING CANDIDATES. AND ONE THING WE NOTICED WAS THAT MODERATOR MARTHA MacCALLUM ASKED SOME PRETTY COMPLICATED QUESTIONS. I DON'T KNOW IF THE CANDIDATES WERE READY FOR THEM. CHECK THIS OUT.
GOVERNOR PATAKI, 45 MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE ON FOOD STAMPS, 9 MILLION ARE ON DISABILITY. THERE'S AN INCREASING WILLINGNESS IN THIS COUNTRY TO ACCEPT ASSISTANCE. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GET OFF OF IT?
I THINK YOU NEED SOMEBODY WHO HAS --
THIS IS A COMPLICATED SITUATION. ARE YOU OKAY WITH US BEING ON THEIR SIDE?
I THINK THE LAST EIGHT YEARS -- [ LAUGHTER ]
WHICH SIDE DO YOU BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE ON?
THE ANSWER IS NO.
WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON?
WHY ME? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. I MEAN -- VERY PICKY. ALSO DURING THE EARLIER DEBATE, RICK PERRY SAID THAT IF HE WERE ELECTED, HE WOULD TEAR UP THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN. YEAH. BUT THEN OBAMA HAD IT LAMINATED JUST TO MESS WITH HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS LIKE, "AW, GIVE ME THE SCISSORS." AND GET THIS, BEFORE LAST WEEK'S REPUBLICAN DEBATE, HILLARY CLINTON'S STAFF TOLD SUPPORTERS TO STOCK UP ON SOFT PROJECTILES LIKE MARSHMALLOWS TO THROW AT THE CANDIDATES ON TV. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHILE CHRIS CHRISTIE'S STAFF TOLD THE SAME THING TO THE LIVE AUDIENCE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NUM, NUM. NUM, NUM. NUM, NUM, NUM, NUM, NUM. [ APPLAUSE ] FUN.
Steve: HEY!
Jimmy: ALSO, I SAW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ON VACATION IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. OOH, YEAH. CRITICS SAY IT MAKES AMERICA LOOK WEAK. OR AT THE VERY LEAST KINDA DORKY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "THE URKEL HAS LANDED. I REPEAT, THE URKEL HAS LANDED." "DID I DO THAT?" [ LAUGHTER ] OOH, A LITTLE DRAMA HERE. A LITTLE DRAMA. IN A NEW INTERVIEW MILEY CYRUS CRITICIZED TAYLOR SWIFT'S VIDEO FOR "BAD BLOOD" SAYING IT GLORIFIES VIOLENCE AND REVENGE AND ADDED, "I DON'T SEE WHY BOOBS ARE WORSE THAN GUNS." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE NOT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S JUST THAT YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE OUT EITHER ONE OF THEM AND RANDOMLY POINT THEM AT PEOPLE. THAT'S THE ONLY THING -- THAT'S THE ONLY THING I ASK. [ APPLAUSE ] NO PROBLEM WITH IT. ONLY THING I ASK. THIS IS COOL HERE. IT'S RUMORED THAT OZZY OSBOURNE MAY BE APPEARING IN THE UPCOMING "GHOSTBUSTERS" MOVIE. [ CHEERS ] OF COURSE, THEY HAD TO USE CGI TO MAKE HIM LOOK LESS LIKE A A GHOST. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S STILL INTERESTING. "SHARON, GET ME OUT OF THIS GHOST TRAP!" [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS SAW THIS, BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF CONTROVERSY IN INDIA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: THERE WAS A LOT OF CONTROVERSY IN INDIA RECENTLY AFTER THE GOVERNMENT BANNED OVER 800 PORN SITES BUT THEN LIFTED THE BAN AFTER JUST A A WEEK. THAT'S RIGHT. PORN STARTED BACK UP AFTER BEING GONE FOR A WEEK, OR AS WE CALL THAT HERE IN AMERICA, "LENT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, THIS IS PRETTY INTERESTING HERE. A NEW REPORT CLAIMS THAT WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE WAS A BIG MARIJUANA USER AND MAY HAVE BEEN HIGH WHEN HE WROTE SOME OF HIS PLAYS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH EXPLAINS THAT ONE LINE, "TO BE OR NOT TO BE, WAIT, WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?" [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! THAT SAXOPHONIST AND FOUR-TIME GRAMMY NOMINEE, BONEY JAMES, SITTING IN WITH THE ROOTS TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY MAN, WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE SHOW. HIS NEW ALBUM "FUTURESOUL" SPENT TEN WEEKS AT NUMBER ONE ON BILLBOARD'S CONTEMPORARY JAZZ CHART. AND YOU CAN CATCH HIM ON TOUR RIGHT NOW. WELCOME, BONEY. GOOD TO SEE YOU, PAL.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PLUS, JIM BELUSHI AND GREAT MUSIC FROM YOLANDA ADAMS. OH MY GOODNESS, TOMORROW NIGHT SHE'S GONNA GO CRAZY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH WOW, CAN'T WAIT.
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: I LOVE HER. THEN LATER THIS WEEK, BEN KINGSLEY, PAUL GIAMATTI AND KEVIN SPACEY ARE JOINING US. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: EVERYONE -- OOH.

Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S A GREAT CROWD. THIS GUY IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN COUNTRY MUSIC. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, HE DESERVES IT. HE WORKS HIS BUTT OFF, MAN. GOSH, HE'S UNBELIEVABLE. ALWAYS BACKSTAGE JUST SIGNING RECORDS AND STUFF. STILL -- I WAS LIKE -- HE'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE, I LOVE THE GUY. LUKE BRYAN IS ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO TALK WITH LUKE AND HE'S GOING TO PERFORM HIS NEW SINGLE "STRIP IT DOWN" FROM HIS NEW ALBUM "KILL THE LIGHTS," WHICH WAS NUMBER ONE ON iTUNES THIS MORNING. SO YEAH, HE'S DOING GREAT. LOVE THAT GUY.
Steve: COME ON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: LUKE BRYAN. GUYS, AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, DONALD TRUMP GOT IN SOME HOT WATER THIS WEEKEND OVER SOME CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS HE MADE ABOUT FOX NEWS ANCHOR MEGYN KELLY. PEOPLE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS. SO EARLIER TODAY, TRUMP HELD A A PRESS CONFERENCE TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE MEANT AS WELL AS CLARIFY SOME OTHER REMARKS HE'S MADE RECENTLY. AND WE GOT FOOTAGE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY? WE GOT FOOTAGE? NO ONE ELSE HAS THE FOOTAGE?
Jimmy: NO, HE GAVE IT TO US.
Steve: NO NEWS SOURCES OR ANYTHING?
Jimmy: YEAH, HIS PEOPLE GAVE IT TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ LAUGHTER ] TO SHOW -- HE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT TO NEWS SOURCES.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: HE DOESN'T TRUST ANYBODY ELSE.
Steve: RIGHT, DOESN'T TRUST 'EM. DOESN'T TRUST THE MEDIA.
Jimmy: I THINK. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW WE GOT OUR HANDS ON THIS VIDEOTAPE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ON VIDEOTAPE? ON THIS HARD -- SOMEBODY SENT US THE FILE.
Steve: OH.
Jimmy: AND WE ENDED UP WITH IT.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT WE GOT. SO WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE TO SEE IT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DONALD TRUMP. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU'RE WELCOME. LOOK, I KNOW EVERYONE'S ALL UP IN ARMS ABOUT THE COMMENTS I MADE ABOUT MEGYN KELLY AFTER LAST WEEK'S GOP DEBATE, WHICH BY THE WAY, I WON EASILY. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS FANTASTIC. THE RATINGS WERE HUGE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, YESTERDAY I CALLED MEGYN KELLY TO PERSONALLY NOT APOLOGIZE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN I SAID BLOOD WAS COMING OUT OF HER WHEREVER, I OBVIOUSLY MEANT NOSE AND EARS. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU THINK I WAS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE, YOU'RE A A DEVIANT. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS NOT REFERRING TO HORMONES OR MENSTRUATION. PERIOD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ANYONE WHO THINKS OTHERWISE IS A TOTAL DEVIANT. IT'S AMAZING HOW THE MEDIA LOVES TO TWIST MY WORDS. VICIOUSLY ATTACK ME. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. LIKE LAST WEEK, WHEN I SAID MY WIFE MELANIA HAD THE BEST MELONS IN THE WORLD OF COURSE I MEANT HER HONEYDEW MELONS, WHICH BY THE WAY, CAN'T BE BEAT. [ LAUGHTER ] ONLY A DEVIANT WOULD THINK I WAS TALKING ABOUT HER BOOBS, WHICH BY THE WAY, ARE CLASSY AND FANTASTIC. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OR THE OTHER DAY WHEN I SAID TO -- I SAID THAT CARLY FIORINA HAD TOO MUCH JUNK IN THE TRUNK. I OBVIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF STUFF SHE KEEPS IN THE BACK OF HER HYUNDAI SONATA. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE A COSTCO BACK THERE. SHE HAS A -- SHE HAS A CASE OF THOSE GIANT CANS OF JUICY JUICE. YOU KNOW, THE ONES THAT YOU HAVE TO OPEN WITH A CAN OPENER ON BOTH SIDES. I PREFER JUICE DRINKS THAT DOESN'T COME IN A PAINT CAN, OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] DEVIANT. [ APPLAUSE ] OR LAST MONTH WHEN I SAID I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A FOURSOME WITH KATY PERRY, TAYLOR SWIFT, AND NICKI MINAJ. I WAS SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT GOLF. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH ALSO EXPLAINS WHY I SAID I'D LOVE FOR THEM TO WASH MY BALLS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DEVIANT. DEVIANT. OKAY? OR WHEN I SAID THAT ME AND GARY BUSEY LIKE TO DO IT DOGGIE STYLE. I JUST MEANT -- [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST MEANT THAT SOMETIMES I'LL TOSS A FRISBEE AND HE'LL CATCH IT IN HIS MOUTH LIKE A A DOG. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT ELSE COULD THAT POSSIBLY MEAN? DEVIANT. TWISTING MY WORDS. AND FINALLY, WHEN I SAID I LOVE FAT TONY'S BIG GREASY SAUSAGE AND COULDN'T WAIT TO GET IT IN MY MOUTH, HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY LOCAL BUTCHER TONY ESPOSITO AND HIS QUALITY MEAT PRODUCTS? DEVIANTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND POUND SOME BUSH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT? DEVIANTS! DEVIANTS! DEVIANTS!

I'D BE LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT I GUESS I NATURALLY ACCLIMATE TO THE HEAT REALLY WELL." I LEFT FOR FIVE DAYS, I CAME BACK AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S LIKE, "OH, THIS IS REAL SOUTHERN HEAT. LIKE ACTING IN A CONVECTION OVEN." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE --

MAN, I LOVE IT. IT'S SO FUN TO COME FROM A A SMALLTOWN AND KIND OF -- YOU KNOW, WE'RE HERE PROBABLY 15, 20 DAYS A YEAR DOING STUFF WITH WORK, WORK-RELATED STUFF.
Jimmy: I JUST SAW YOU SIGNING ALBUMS BACKSTAGE --
OH YEAH, WE'RE WORKING, SIGNING SOME DIGITAL ALBUMS FOR THE FANS AND STUFF. BUT WE --
Jimmy: YOU DON'T STOP. BUT YOU'RE SELLING OUT STADIUMS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW BIG YOU ARE, WHAT YOU'VE BECOME? YOU'RE LUKE BRYAN. I MEAN, THIS IS A MAJOR DEAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: SELLING OUT STADIUMS.
IT'S CRAZY.
Jimmy: A STADIUM. WERE YOU EVER IN LIKE A BAR BAND?
OH, MAN, WE DID THE WHOLE BAR SCENE.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS YOUR BAND NAME?
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT'S A TERRIBLE BAND NAME.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S CALLED "NEYAMI ROAD."
Jimmy: THAT'S TERRIBLE. "NEYAMI"?
"NEYAMI." AND WE USED TO SAY LIKE YOUR KNEE? SWEET POTATO YAMS, "NEYAMI." [ LAUGHTER ]
CAN I BORROW A PEN?
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M GONNA WRITE THAT DOWN.
Jimmy: I'M SURPRISED YOU GUYS DIDN'T TAKE OFF. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, "NEYAMI"?
WHERE I GREW UP, THERE WAS BY RAILROAD, WHICH REALLY IS NOT EVEN IMPORTANT.
Jimmy: BUT YOU THOUGHT YOU'D SAY RAILROAD.
BY RAILROAD, IT WAS THE GEOGRAPHICAL MIDPOINT BETWEEN NEW YORK AND MIAMI BY RAILROAD.
Jimmy: YES! I KNEW THAT!
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
Jimmy: NEYAMI. NEYAMI.
WHAT WAS FUNNY IS THAT --
Jimmy: "NEYAMI ROAD."
YES.
Jimmy: YES, THAT WAS FAMOUS, THE CROSSROADS.
ANYWAY, BUT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN "NEYAMI RAILROAD." OUR CAREER WAS RAILROADED, BUT -- SO WHAT WAS FUNNY IS LIKE BACK WHEN THE JUDDS WERE POPULAR, PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE, "NAOMI JUDD?" THEY CALLED US "NAOMI ROAD."
Jimmy: YOU'RE LIKE "NO, 'NEYAMI ROAD.'" YOU GO, "IT'S NOT WORTH IT. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 'NAOMI ROAD.'"
KIDS OUT THERE, NAME YOUR BAND WHERE PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND.
Jimmy: LUKE BRYAN IS MUCH BETTER, YEAH.
ACCELERATE YOUR CAREER.
Jimmy: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU WERE DOING THOSE GIGS?
WE WERE PROBABLY 17, 18. AND THEN I WAS GOING TO MOVE TO NASHVILLE AND THAT CHANGED. AND THEN WE KIND OF KICKED THE BAND BACK UP AND WE PLAYED IN "NEYAMI ROAD" ALL THE WAY -- NOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR THOSE ALBUMS. PLEASE DON'T GET THOSE ALBUMS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WANT TO HEAR THEM RIGHT NOW, TOO. WHAT SONG ARE YOU DOING FOR US, TONIGHT?
WE'LL DO "STRIP IT DOWN." IT'S A NEW SINGLE.
Jimmy: STRIP IT DOWN YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
HEY!
Jimmy: YOU'RE PLAYING THE PIANO IN THIS.
I'M TRYING TO HELP THE BOYS OUT THERE, GIVE THEM A LITTLE LOVING, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS A LITTLE LIKE A SEXY TIME SONG.
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME RIGHT NOW?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, MAN.
OH, YEAH?
Jimmy: YEAH! YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, MAN? [ LAUGHTER ]
I LOVE HOW HE -- HE'S GOT, LIKE, THE COOLEST LEG CROSS.
Jimmy: HE CAN DO A MELONI LEG CROSS. OOH! HE EASES ON INTO IT. THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT. SEE I HAVE NO -- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LEGS. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LEGS. LOOK AT THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW I SIT. [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S COMFORTABLE FOR ME. I LIKE THE WAY IT FEELS. AND I DON'T CARE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE WHAT I'M DOING. BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN JUST TELL IN MY FACE IF I'M DOING IT. ASK ME A QUESTION. JUST ASK ME A QUESTION.
HOW ARE YOU DOING? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: FANTASTIC. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
WHAT'S THE WEATHER LOOKING LIKE?
Jimmy: WHAT'S THE WEATHER?
HOW'S THE WEATHER OUTSIDE? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S GOING TO BE NICE. IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY COOL. YOU KNOW, IT'S A PRIVATE JOKE BETWEEN ME AND MY KNEECAPS. GUYS, I CAN'T WAIT. IT'S GONNA COME BACK OUT. LUKE BRYAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
