AH! AH!
Jimmy: WE ARE JOINED RIGHT NOW BY A PAIR OF HUGELY INFLUENTIAL MUSICIANS. NEIL YOUNG, ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF ALL TIME. HE'S GOT -- THIS IS HIS NEW ALBUM HERE. "A LETTER HOME." THIS IS THE ALBUM. THIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU GET THIS. IT'S JUST INSANE. I GOTTA TALK ABOUT IT. THIS WAS PRODUCED IN JACK WHITE'S STUDIO IN NASHVILLE USING A 70-YEAR-OLD VINYL RECORDING BOOTH. AND, YEAH, HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND MORE COOL STUFF. ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITE MUSICIANS. PLEASE WELCOME JACK WHITE AND NEIL YOUNG. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WELCOME TO THE SHOW, GUYS. YEAH, WE LOVE THE ROOTS. NOW, JACK YOU PERFORMED ON OUR SHOW A FEW TIMES WHEN WE WERE LATE NIGHT.
I'M SORRY YOUR NAME WAS? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: UH, HI. HOW YOU DOING? NEIL'S SON. NEIL, YOU KIND OF PERFORMED ON OUR SHOW.
I WAS HERE. I WAS HERE A LONG TIME AGO.
Jimmy: LOOKING GOOD. LOOKING GOOD.
THINK IT WAS ONLY TWO YEARS AGO.
Jimmy: TWO YEARS AGO WAS THE LAST TIME I DID AN IMPRESSION OF YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME DO THAT. SUNG SOME GREAT HITS.
WHEN I LOOKED AT THAT I GO, "WHAT COLORIST DID I HAVE WHEN I DID THAT?"
Jimmy: NO. YOU HAD NICE BROW HAIR. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. YOU'RE A STUD, ABSOLUTELY. WE'RE HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. LOOK AT THIS. "A LETTER HOME," THIS IS THE ACTUAL, THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE BOX SET, RIGHT? THIS IS WHAT YOU GET RIGHT HERE. AND IS THIS JUST LIKE PACKING TAPE?
IT IS. IT'S HANDWRITTEN AND THOSE ARE POLAROID'S, REAL POLAROID'S ON THE COVER THERE.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT. THIS IS THE MOST FUN THING. THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. HOW FUN IS THI? IT COMES OUT MAY 27th. HOW DO WE GET THIS?
UM --
Jimmy: HOW DO WE BUY THIS? IN STORES OR ONLINE?
YOU GOT MY PHONE NUMBER, RIGHT?
Jimmy: NO, NOT ME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I MEAN EVERYONE ELSE HERE. HOW DO THEY GET IT? TO GO NEIL'S WEBSITE?
RECORD STORES EVERYWHERE. AND THIRD MAN RECORDS HAS IT ONLINE TOO IF YOU WANNA ORDER IT THAT WAY.
Jimmy: SO FUN. WHAT MADE YOU GET INTO THIS RECORDING IN THE VINYL BOOTH, RECORDING BOOTH THING?
WE HAD A THING -- I SPENT A A YEAR AND A HALF RESTORING THAT RECORD BOOTH. I LOOKED FOR TEN YEARS AND FINALLY FOUND IT THROUGH THIS GUY BILL BOUMAN WHO KNEW SOME COLLECTORS IN THE MECHANICAL WORLD. SO, A YEAR AND A HALF GETTING IT RUNNING. IT WAS NOT AN EASY TASK. AND WE HAD IT -- FOR RECORD -- WE DEBUTED IT. AND NEIL YOUNG HAPPENED TO BE IN TOWN WITH HIS ELECTRIC CAR. WE BOTH OWN ELECTRIC CARS TOO. SO WE WERE GETTING TOGETHER TO JUST TALK ABOUT THAT. AND WHEN HE WAS THERE -- [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYONE WAS USING THE BOOTH FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. AND WE HAD A CURTAIN BEHIND IT. SO WE WERE JUST TALKING, AND A A KID COMES IN AND COVERS ONE NEIL'S SONGS IN THE BOOTH.
WE WERE PLAYING AND SINGING AND EVERYBODY GOT IN AND DID A A THING. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, THEY GIVE IT, AND THEY HAVE THEIR RECORD. AND THEY'D LEAVE WITH IT. AND I SAID TO JACK, "I WANT TO TRY THAT. LET ME TRY THAT OUT."
Jimmy: THESE KIDS GOING IN AND SINGING MY SONGS.
YEAH I WANNA TRY SOMEBODY ELSE'S SONG.
Jimmy: "HEART OF GOLD," YEAH I WANNA DO THAT. LET ME DO IT. I'M HERE. I'M ME.
I WENT IN THERE AND DID IT. AND I THOUGHT -- I SAID TO JACK, "YOU KNOW I COULD DO AN ALBUM IN THERE, RIGHT?"
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I SAID, "I HAVE SOMEONE ELSE ON THE OTHER LINE. WAIT ONE SECOND. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, RIGHT? YOU DID NOT. YOU NEVER DID THAT. BUT THIS IS LIKE -- "A LETTER HOME" IS THE NAME OF IT. AND HOW DO YOU CHOOSE THESE SONGS?
THESE ARE SONGS BY GREAT SONGWRITERS THAT INFLUENCED ME WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. PEOPLE, MUSICIANS AND SINGER/SONGWRITERS. JUST ALL OF THEM COULD PLAY THEIR OWN INSTRUMENT AND SING BY THEMSELVES AND DELIVER A A SONG. YOU KNOW, SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO ME WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. SO THAT'S WHY I CHOSE THOSE SONGS BECAUSE THEY MEAN SO MUCH TO ME.
Jimmy: AND YOU WILL BE DOING "CRAZY" TONIGHT. PATSY CLINE MADE IT FAMOUS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH. WRITTEN BY WILLIE NELSON.
Jimmy: REALLY? WILLIE NELSON WROTE THAT.
WILLIE NELSON WROTE THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. PRE LONG HAIR.
YEAH EARLY WILLIE.
Jimmy: EARLY WILLIE NELSON AND THEN YOU HAVE "ON THE ROAD AGAIN" IS ON THIS ALBUM, BY WILLIE AS WELL. GORDON LIGHTFOOT, "IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND."
WHAT A SONG. UNBELIEVABLE.
THAT'S MY FAVORITE ON THIS RECORD.
Jimmy: IS IT REALLY? WE HAD HIM ON THE SHOW. GORDON, HE'S A GOOD GUY. "SINCE I MET YOU BABY" IS THAT -- ♪ SINCE I MET YOU BABY ♪
IVORY JOE HUNTER. WOW. GREAT, GREAT RECORD.
Jimmy: GREAT RECORD RIGHT THERE. "MY HOMETOWN." BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN.
YEAH. THAT WAS THE NEWEST ONE I DID. I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCH A GREAT SONG. WHAT A GREAT SONGWRITER AND PERFORMER. AND WHEN HE PLAYS BY HIMSELF, YOU KNOW, NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE SEEN HIM DO THAT BUT HE'S REALLY, REALLY GREAT BY HIMSELF. SO PEOPLE CAN DO THINGS BY THEMSELVES AND CARRY THE SONG, THAT IS PART OF WHAT THAT'S ABOUT.
Jimmy: AND THIS IS THE FIRST SONG YOU'VE DONE WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SINCE "WHIP MY HAIR."
YEAH. AND THAT WAS GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT. I THOUGHT I WAS REALLY GOOD IN THAT.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. WELL IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON. I FORGOT TO THANK YOU, BUT I DID SAY YOUR WELCOME AS YOU WHEN I THANKED YOU EARLIER.
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN WE DID THAT?
Jimmy: WE WERE RIGHT OVER THERE. YEAH, YOU WERE RIGHT OVER THERE WHEN WE DID THAT. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE THIS BOX, THIS BOOTH THAT YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU FROM NASHVILLE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AND EXPLAIN WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE. [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS JUST ABSOLUTELY SO -- WHEN WAS THIS MADE AROUND?
THIS IS ABOUT 1947. AND THEY STOPPED MAKING THEM IN THE 60'S. IT WENT THROUGH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT DESIGNS. BUT THIS IS I THINK THE MOST BEAUTIFUL. IT HAS LOTS OF WOOD AND STEEL.
SINCE WE STARTED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO WE'VE HAD ALMOST A A THOUSAND PEOPLE RECORD IN THIS.
Jimmy: REALLY?
AND WE HAVE A THING WHERE YOU CAN SEND THE RECORDING TO US AND WE'LL POST IT ONLINE. WE HAVE A COLLECTION GOING OF THAT.
Jimmy: AND IT COMES OUT AS A A VINYL. IT MAKES IT RIGHT THERE. AND THEN YOU HAVE A LITTLE SLEEVE FOR IT WITH AN ADDRESS.
YOU CAN MAIL IT FROM THIRD MAN RECORDS. THIS IS A COOL THING. WHERE NEIL DID HIS WHOLE NEW ALBUM. AND ANYBODY CAN COME TO NASHVILLE AND YOU RECORD IN THIS EXACT SAME BOOTH. IT'S THE ONLY ONE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC IN THE WORLD.
Jimmy: I LOVE THE SOUND IN THIS THING. IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.
AND YOU CAN ATTEST.
