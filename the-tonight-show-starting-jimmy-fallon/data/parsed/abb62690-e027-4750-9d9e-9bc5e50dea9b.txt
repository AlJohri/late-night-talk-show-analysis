WE'RE ALL EXCITED HERE, BECAUSE EARLIER TONIGHT WAS THE BIG SEASON OPENER FOR THE NFL. THAT'S RIGHT. FOOTBALL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DID YOU SEE IT?
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: THE PATRIOTS PLAYED THEIR FIRST GAME SINCE THE DEFLATE-GATE SCANDAL. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE REFS SPENT A LONG TIME EXAMINING BALLS, BUT TODAY, THEY WERE HIRED BY THE TSA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M GONNA HAVE TO DIP MY HAND DOWN YOUR PANTS. [ LAUGHTER ] COME ON.
Steve: JACKPOT.
Jimmy: LET'S GET TO SOME POLITICAL NEWS, HERE. YESTERDAY, HILLARY CLINTON VOWED TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION IF IRAN MOVES TOWARDS CREATING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. OR IF SHE LOSES TO BERNIE SANDERS. EITHER WAY, IT'S LIKE, "FIRE UP THE DRONES! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE GETTING TOO CLOSE, BERNIE. FIRE UP THE DRONES!" I ALSO SAW THAT DONALD TRUMP USED THE REM SONG "IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT" AT A RALLY IN WASHINGTON D.C. THE BAND DID NOT LIKE THAT. NO. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DID NOT ENJOY IT. THEY RESPONDED BY CALLING HIM AN ORANGE CLOWN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU COULD TELL THAT TRUMP WAS PRETTY UPSET. BECAUSE, THE NEXT DAY HE CAME OUT TO A DIFFERENT REM SONG. ♪ EVERYBODY HURTS SOMETIMES ♪ [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: IT'S SAD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DONALD TRUMP WAS ALSO AT THE U.S. OPEN HERE IN NEW YORK THIS WEEK FOR THE BIG MATCH BETWEEN SERENA AND VENUS WILLIAMS. AND HE ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE HE WAS PRETTY DEEP IN THOUGHT. AND I KEPT THINKING TO MYSELF, "I WONDER WHAT IS GOING THROUGH HIS MIND THERE."
THIS IS UTTERLY BORING. I COULD BEAT SERENA WITH MY EYES CLOSED. I CAN SEE IT NOW. HERE I AM, PLAYING SERENA. HI-YA. I'M A TOTAL PRO. TAKE THAT. YOU JUST LOST THE GAME. I'M THE WINNER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M THE WINNER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "DEUCES." AND IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, I READ THAT TRUMP SAID THAT HE'S "BASICALLY THE SAME NOW AS HE WAS WHEN HE WAS IN FIRST GRADE." [ LAUGHTER ] AGAIN, THAT GOT ME WONDERING WHAT ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WERE LIKE AT THAT AGE, OKAY? SO, WE DID SOME RESEARCH, AND WE DUG UP THEIR FIRST GRADE REPORT CARDS. CHECK OUT WHAT THEIR TEACHERS HAD TO SAY IN THE COMMENTS. FOR INSTANCE, HILLARY CLINTON'S FIRST GRADE TEACHER WROTE, "HILLARY IS A VERY BRIGHT YOUNG GIRL. HOWEVER, WE DISCOVERED THAT, IN ADDITION TO HER CLASSROOM CUBBY, SHE KEEPS HER OWN PERSONAL CUBBY AT HOME FILLED WITH SUPPLIES THAT ARE FOR SCHOOL ONLY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SHE HAS A SEPARATE CUBBY.
Steve: YEAH, SEPARATE CUBBY. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
Jimmy: SECRET CUBBY. NEXT, WE HAVE JEB BUSH'S FIRST GRADE TEACHER. SHE WROTE, "I LOVE HAVING JEB IN MY CLASS. WHEN NAP TIME ROLLS AROUND, I JUST ASK HIM TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF THE OTHER KIDS, AND WITHIN 30 SECONDS, THEY'RE ALL OUT COLD."
Steve: WOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

[ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT. NEXT, RICK PERRY'S FIRST GRADE TEACHER WROTE, "RICK IS ONE OF THE MOST POLITE 14-YEAR-OLD BOYS. I'M SO HAPPY TO HAVE HIM BACK AGAIN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: AND AGAIN.
Jimmy: I'M GONNA GET THROUGH KINDERGARTEN. FIRST GRADE. FINALLY LINCOLN CHAFEE'S FIRST GRADE TEACHER WROTE, "WHO DIS?" [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS, NOT ALL OF THEM ARE MEMORABLE CHILDREN. THEY CAN'T REMEMBER -- WHO DIS?
Steve: WHO DIS? THAT WHAT WHEN HE WAS -- HE WAS IN HER CLASS, YEAH.
Jimmy: A TEACHER WROTE THAT, YEAH.
Steve: SHE KNEW THAT WAS GONNA BE A PHRASE
Jimmy: AN ENGLISH TEACHER, YEAH. HEY, THIS IS PROBABLY GOOD ADVICE, EVERYBODY. THE U.S. SURGEON GENERAL RELEASED A STATEMENT THIS WEEK THAT SAID MORE AMERICANS SHOULD START GOING ON WALKS. YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE SETTING THE BAR A LITTLE LOW WHEN THE SURGEON GENERAL GOES FROM SAYING WE SHOULD EXERCISE MORE TO JUST STAND UP. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST ONCE. JUST FOR ONE MINUTE, JUST STAND UP. HOW SAD IS THAT? THE SURGEON GENERAL SAID MORE AMERICANS SHOULD START GOING ON WALKS, AND THEN, TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE HE ADDED, "EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST GOING OUT TO HAVE A A SMOKE. [ APPLAUSE ] ANY TYPE OF WALKING. I'M JUST SAYING ANY MOVEMENT." THAT'S RIGHT, HE WANTS MORE WALKING. CAN WE SEE A PICTURE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL? WELL, THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE WANTS MORE WALKING.

IT'S REALLY, REALLY GONNA BE FUN. IF WE CAN PULL IT OFF, IT'S REALLY COOL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU NEVER KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE PROMISES IN CASE WE DON'T PULL IT OFF. THEY'LL BE LIKE, "THAT WAS IT?" "YEAH, NO, THAT -- WE HAD SOMETHING ELSE PLANNED." IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY, REALLY BIG.

Jimmy: I HAVE A PICTURE OF ISAIAH HERE HOLDING A HOCKEY STICK JUST LIKE HIS DADDY. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] LOOK, THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL BABY RIGHT THERE. OH MY GOODNESS.
HE IS.
Jimmy: AND HAS THE BABY, I KNOW HE'S CLEARLY INTO HOCKEY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IS THE BABY MUSICALLY INCLINED? I KNOW YOU SING. LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU TOLD ME YOUR HUSBAND SINGS "WHOOMP! THERE IT IS." REMEMBER THAT?
HE DOES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THE WORST.
Jimmy: HE PROBABLY LOVES YOU FOR TELLING ME THAT.
HE DID.
Jimmy: AND IS THE BABY, LIKE, A LITTLE MUSICALLY INCLINED?
I FEEL LIKE HE'S INTERESTED IN MUSIC. SO IF A COMMERCIAL COMES ON AND IT'S A MUSICAL COMMERCIAL HE'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, ZONED INTO IT.
Jimmy: YEAH. MY DAUGHTER'S REALLY INTO THE SECRET ESCAPES WOMAN.
OH, YEAH?
Jimmy: YOU KNOW THAT COMMERCIAL? SHE WHISPERS.
SHE WHISPERS. [ WHISPERING ]
Jimmy: I'M ON A VACATION. SHH. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT? NOTHING HONEY. GO AWAY. MY WINNIE COULD BE WATCHING "PEPPA PIG," WHATEVER, SHE DOESN'T REALLY CARE. BUT AS SOON AS THE WHISPER LADY IS LIKE, "I'M ON VACATION." [ LAUGHTER ] SO NOW, I DO IT, TOO. I'M REALLY INTO THE SECRET ESCAPES LADY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. SHE'S FANTASTIC.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WE WANT TO BOOK HER ON THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NOW YOU HAVE A FAMILY. YOU HAVE A PERFECT FAMILY. YOU GOT TWO LITTLE DOGS, RIGHT?
YES.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. HOW ARE THE DOGS WITH THE BABY?
THEY ARE, THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD. THE ONE THAT I THOUGHT WOULD LIKE LOVE HIM AND, LIKE, BE EXCITED AROUND HIM REALLY IGNORES HIM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH.
YEAH. AND THEN THE ONE THAT I WAS LIKE, "OH, WE'RE KINDA GONNA HAVE TO WATCH HER. 'CAUSE SHE'S KINDA THE WILDCARD." AND SHE LOVES HIM. SHE'LL LIKE LICK HIS FACE AND RUN AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LICKS HIS FACE AND RUN AWAY. WHAT KIND OF DOGS ARE THEY?
A RAT TERRIER AND I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: EXCUSE ME?
A RAT TERRIER.
Jimmy: OH, A RAT TERRIER.
YES.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. IT SOUNDED LIKE, I THOUGHT YOU SAID ROETHLISBERGER. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW THAT DOG.
THAT'S ALSO A DOG NAME.
Jimmy: IT'S ALSO A DOG NAME.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S A VERY POPULAR DOG. BUT THEN YOUR DOGS ARE TROUBLEMAKERS. I WANT TO SAY THIS.
THEY ARE. THEY ARE NAUGHTY.
Jimmy: THEY ARE TROUBLE MAKING DOGS. THEY'RE SCARY. YOU TWEETED OUT -- WELL, I DON'T KNOW. NO, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
YEAH, I DO.
YOU TWEETED OUT SOMETHING, YOUR DOGS LOCKED YOUR BABY IN THE CAR AND YOU WERE NOT IN THERE?
THAT WAS THEIR EVIL PLOT OR SOMETHING. THEY GOT TOGETHER AND THEY --
Jimmy: NO. WHAT HAPPENED? THE DOGS LOCKED THE BABY IN THE CAR WITH THE DOGS?
WE WERE AT THE AIRPORT. AND LIKE YOU DO, YOU GOTTA GET YOUR LUGGAGE. SO WE GET OUT OF THE CAR.
Jimmy: YEAH.
GET OUT THE DOOR, THE CAR WAS RUNNING, THE RADIO WAS ON, AIR- CONDITIONING'S GOING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WE WERE JUST, YOU KNOW, GONNA GET OUR LUGGAGE OUT OF THE BACK. AND THE SECOND WE SHUT THE DOORS THE DOG, LIKE, JUMPS UP ON -- I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IT WAS, THE LITTLE CONTROL PANEL ARM THINGY AND THE DOORS LOCKED.
LOCKED YOUR BABY IN THE CAR WITH THE TWO DOGS.
BABY IN THE CAR, YEAH. AND THEN WE SPENT LIKE THE NEXT HALF HOUR TRYING TO GET TO HIM. I WAS CONVINCED, I WAS LIKE, THEY CAN DO IT AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY CAN UNLOCK THE DOOR.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T TRAIN THE DOG TO UNLOCK THE DOOR.
I WAS LIKE KNOCKING ON IT. I WAS LIKE, "ACE, COME HERE! COME HERE!"
Jimmy: ACE, COME ON, COME ON. GIVE ME THE PAW. GIVE ME THE PAW. GIVE ME THE PAW. [ LAUGHTER ]
ACE, SHAKE. SHAKE.
Jimmy: SHAKE. SHE WAS JUST LOOKING AT YOU LIKE --
