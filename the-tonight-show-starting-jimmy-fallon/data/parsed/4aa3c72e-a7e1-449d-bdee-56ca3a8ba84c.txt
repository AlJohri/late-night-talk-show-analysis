AND OF COURSE, WE HAVE ALL OF YOU HERE TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU IF BEING HERE, NEW YORK CITY. I APPRECIATE IT. LET'S HAVE FUN. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME NEWS HERE. GOOD NEWS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY JUST ANNOUNCED THAT OBAMACARE ADDED A MILLION NEW CUSTOMERS IN ITS THIRD OPEN ENROLLMENT SEASON. YEAH. THEY SAY MORE PEOPLE ARE SIGNING UP FOR HEALTH CARE DUE TO THE LOOMING DEADLINE, LOW COSTS AND THE SALES OF HOVERBOARDS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLUSE ] THEY'RE EXPLODING.
Steve: MY FOOT.
Jimmy: IN A NEW INTERVIEW WITH "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT HIS FAVORITE BOOK OF THE YEAR WAS A A NOVEL CALLED "FATES AND FURIES." YEAH. WHILE HILLARY CLINTON SAID HER FAVORITE BOOK OF THE YEAR WAS WHATEVER YOURS WAS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LOVED IT. YEAH, THAT'S MY FAVORITE. ACTUALLY "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE DID A BIG FEATURE ON ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND THEY ASKED THEM ABOUT THEIR FAVORITE FOOD TO EAT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. MOST OF THEM GAVE SHORT, SIMPLE ANSWERS. FOR INSTANCE, MARCO RUBIO SAID CHICKEN QUESADILLAS. CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID NACHOS. AND THEN THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S ACTUAL ANSWER. WE DIDN'T CHANGE ONE WORD OF THIS. HE SAID, "IT'S ONLY SNACKS BECAUSE I TEND TO JUST BE ABLE TO EAT SNACKS BECAUSE SO BUSY AND SO MANY PEOPLE AND SO MUCH HOOPLA THAT LITERALLY IT'S ONLY SNACKS. NOT THE HEALTHIEST OF EATING, BUT IT'S THERE. IT WOULD ONLY SNACKS. STUFF I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND. THERE'S SO LITTLE TIME TO BE EATING. IT'S GRABBING. I HAVE LOST 15 POUNDS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. ONE OF THE BIG REASONS I HAVE I HAVE A BIG GRAB. VERY EXCITING STUFF. AND WHEN YOU SPEAK AND YOU ARE REALLY GOING AT IT, YOU TEND TO, I NEVER THOUGHT IT, BUT SPEAKING IS ALMOST A FORM OF EXERCISE. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY EXHILARATING. LAST NIGHT I WAS IN KNOXVILLE FOR 12,000 PEOPLE. WHEN YOU'RE SPEAKING TO 12,000 GREAT PEOPLE, YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE EATING. I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE COULD GAIN WEIGHT, BUT I HAVE LOST WEIGHT. THE EVENT IS SO EXCITING. WHEN I'M DONE, I DON'T WANT TO EAT. I CAN SEE HOW IT WOULD GO THE OTHER WAY FOR OTHER PEOPLE. THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE THEIR EVENTS ARE BORING." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ THEN SOMEONE PUT SNACKS IN HIS MOUTH SO HE JUST STOPPED TALKING. JUST EAT -- JUST SAY PIZZA, MAN. WHO CARES. BUYS, THE BIG STORY STILL SEEMS TO BE DONALD TRUMP. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS WEIGHING IN ON HIS CAMPAIGN. THIS WEEK, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST SAID THAT TRUMP'S STATEMENT ABOUT BANNING MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS DISQUALIFIES HIM FROM BEING PRESIDENT. WHEN HE HEARD THAT, JEB BUSH WAS LIKE, "YOU CAN GET DISQUALIFIED? HOW DO I DO THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOW DO I DO THIS? I'M READY TO GET OUT." DID YOU SEE THIS? TRUMP RECENTLY TWEETED THAT HIS DOCTOR WILL RELEASE HIS FULL MEDICAL REPORT SOON. AND SAID THE REPORT WILL SHOW, QUOTE, PERFECTION. [ LAUGHTER ] WE ACTUALLY GOT OUR HANDS ON IT.
