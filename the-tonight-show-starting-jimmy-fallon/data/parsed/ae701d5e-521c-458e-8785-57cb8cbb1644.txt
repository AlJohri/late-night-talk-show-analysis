Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- TIM ALLEN -- DANAI GURIRA -- MUSICAL GUEST JENNIFER NETTLES -- AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 374 ARMENIA.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S A CROWD RIGHT THERE. THE ROAR OF THE CROWD. THAT'S FANTASTIC. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST. MY NAME IS JIMMY FALLON. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. SOME MORE TROUBLE FOR BEN CARSON. YEAH, IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, HE SAID THAT THOMAS JEFFERSON WROTE THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, WHEN HE ACTUALLY IN FACT WROTE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OR AS CARSON'S CAMPAIGN STAFF PUT IT, "IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH. WE'LL TAKE THAT ONE. IT'S NOT AS BAD. IT COULD BE MUCH WORSE. HE DIDN'T SAY ALIENS." [ LAUGHTER ] HE DIDN'T SAY THE EGYPTIANS, DID HE? NOT THAT BAD. MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP WAS RECENTLY BEING INTERVIEWED AND HE SAID THAT HE IS NOT A FAN OF THE MAN BUN TREND. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WOULDN'T WANT TO WEAR HIS HAIR THAT WAY. YOU KNOW IT'S BAD WHEN EVEN DONALD TRUMP IS LIKE, "I'M NOT PUTTING THAT ON MY HEAD. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S TOO FAR. MAKES ME LOOK RIDICULOUS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] "PERFECT. BEAUTIFUL. A NICE HAIR WALL." [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT NBC HAS OFFICIALLY GRANTED MIKE HUCKABEE, JOHN KASICH, JIM GILMORE, AND LINDSEY GRAHAM FREE AIR TIME TO EQUAL DONALD TRUMP'S RECENT "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" APPEARANCE. WHEN ASKED HOW THEY'LL FEATURE THE CANDIDATES, NBC WAS LIKE, "WELL LET'S JUST SAY THE THANKSGIVING PARADE JUST GOT A A FEW MORE CLOWNS." [ LAUGHTER ] AND -- JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. AND THEY'LL BE THERE -- "HOLDING KERMIT THE FROG DOWN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] WINDY DAY HERE." [ AS TRUMP ] "HOPE IT'S NOT THAT WINDY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: THE MAN BUN.
Jimmy: OVER ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT STING IS GOING TO PERFORM AT A FUNDRAISER FOR HILLARY CLINTON NEXT MONTH. HILLARY SAID SHE'S BEEN A HUGE STING FAN EVER SINCE HE AGREED TO PERFORM AT HER FUNDRAISER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I'M A BIG -- OH, I LOVE HIM. YOU CAN'T MAKE IT? I HATE HIM. OH, HE CAN MAKE IT." THAT'S RIGHT, STING WILL PERFORM AT A FUNDRAISER FOR HILLARY CLINTON. THE FUNDRAISER SHOULD LAST TWO HOURS, ALTHOUGH STING CLAIMS HE CAN MAKE IT LAST TEN. SO WE'LL SEE. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪
TANTRIC. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TANTRIC. DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? RAPPER KILLER MIKE SAT DOWN TO EAT WITH BERNIE SANDERS AT A A SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT IN ATLANTA BEFORE INTRODUCING SANDERS AT A NEARBY RALLY. AND HE LATER ENDORSED SANDERS AND EVEN HELPED BERNIE COME UP WITH A FEW RAPPER NAMES OF HIS OWN. YEAH CHECK IT OUT. BERNIE COULD BE OLD CRANKY BASTARD. [ LAUGHTER ] HE COULD BE FLOMAX RIDA. [ LAUGHTER ] OR SOUP DOGG. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S GOT A LOT OF OPTIONS. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THREE GOOD OPTIONS, HE COULD CHOOSE ANY ONE OF THOSE. THANK YOU, KILLER MIKE. THIS IS INTERESTING HERE. A NEW SURVEY FOUND THAT WHEN PEOPLE WERE ASKED WHICH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE OVER FOR THANKSGIVING DINNER, THE MOST POPULAR ANSWER WAS HILLARY CLINTON. TAKE A LOOK AT THE POLL RESULTS. 24% OF PEOPLE SAID HILLARY CLINTON. 15% SAID BEN CARSON, BUT ONLY IF HE STABBED THE TURKEY FOR THE REST OF THE TABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY MEAN CARVE, I THINK.
Steve: AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T HAVE A BELT.
Jimmy: 9% SAID DONALD TRUMP SO MY UNCLE ISN'T THE ONLY ONE YELLING ABOUT OBAMA. [ LAUGHTER ] 7% SAID JEB BUSH IS STANDING OUTSIDE MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW IN THE RAIN. I'LL PUT A PLATE OF FOOD OUT FRONT BUT I'M NOT LETTING HIM IN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, 45% SAID, "CAN I SAY NONE? I WANT NONE OF THESE PEOPLE IN MY HOME." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S THANKSGIVING. OH, AND I HEARD AMC WILL BROADCAST A MARATHON OF THE ENTIRE "GODFATHER" TRILOGY ON THANKSGIVING. [ CHEERS ] IF YOU WANT TO WATCH A DRAMATIC FAMILY FALLING APART ON THANKSGIVING, NOW YOU'VE GOT TWO WAYS TO DO THAT. FANTASTIC. [ APPLAUSE ] GOOD THINKING ON AMC'S PART, YEAH. SOME BUSINESS NEWS. THE COMPANY THAT MAKES VIAGRA AND THE COMPANY THAT MAKES BOTOX ARE SET TO MERGE IN A A RECORD $160 BILLION DEAL. [ CHEERS ] BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING A A DOCTOR WANTS TO SEE IT'S A A GUY WITH A GIANT GRIN WHOSE VIAGRA WON'T WEAR OFF. HE'S LIKE, "HEY THERE, DOC. IT'S BEEN WAY MORE THAN FOUR HOURS. I GOT TO GET RID OF THIS THING. I'M GETTING LIGHTHEADED."
Steve: I GOT NO WRINKLES ANYWHERE, DOC. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO WRINKLES. NOT ONE WRINKLE. THIS IS KIND OF COOL. I READ THAT SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING THAT MARS MIGHT EVENTUALLY GET RINGS LIKE SATURN. WHICH IS THE SAME SORT OF PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE THING YOUR MOM WILL TELL YOU ON THANKSGIVING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "I HEARD MARS GOT A RING. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M JUST SAYING, YOU GOTTA GET OUT THERE. LIKE MARS." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, McDONALD'S SAID IT HAS PUT NEW GUIDELINES IN PLACE FOR ITS EMPLOYEES TO MAKE DRIVE-THROUGH ORDERS MORE ACCURATE, AND IT'S CALLING THE METHOD "ASK ASK TELL," AS OPPOSED TO THE McRIB, WHICH HAS THE MOTTO "DON'T ASK, DON'T ASK, DON'T ASK."

I KNOW, SOME NYU LOVERS OVER THERE.
Jimmy: HOMETOWN CROWD.
THEY'RE JUST BEING KIND.
Jimmy: NO, PLEASE.
AND THEN -- BUT SHE CHOSE YALE. AND I WAS LIKE, OKAY. FINE, GO TO YALE. BUT THE BEAUTY OF GOING TO YALE WAS, YOU KNOW, LITTLE YALE. BUT THE BEAUTY OF GOING TO YALE --
Jimmy: LITTLE OLD YALE, YEAH.
NEVER HEARD OF IT. BUT THE BEAUTY OF IT WAS, YOU KNOW, MY PLAY "ECLIPSED" WAS GONNA HAVE A PRODUCTION THERE. AND SO, SHE WAS A FIRST YEAR, AND SHE UNDERSTUDIED THE ROLE THAT SHE'S NOW PLAYING AND THAT SHE'LL PLAY ON BROADWAY NEXT YEAR. SO, THAT'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: AND SO, SHE CALLED YOU UP?
SHE DID. SHE REALLY WANTED TO GET BACK ON STAGE. YOU KNOW, RIGHT AFTER SHE GRADUATED, ALL THESE AMAZING THINGS HAPPENED. AND SO SHE CALLED -- SHE E-MAILED ME AND SAID, "DANAI, I REALLY WANT TO GET BACK ON STAGE AND I WANNA DO IT WITH YOUR PLAY."
Jimmy: HOW EXCITING IS THAT? I MEAN, YOU WROTE A PLAY. IT'S ON BROADWAY. I FEEL LIKE I'M MORE EXCITED. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE PLAYING IT VERY COOL. I'D BE LIKE -- BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE BUDDIES LIKE LUPITA EITHER CALLING ME GOING, OH, YOU WANNA DO THAT PLAY? MY FRIENDS ARE ALL LIKE --
I'VE SPOKEN TO -- AND THE BEAUTY OF THAT IS IT'S A FIVE-WOMAN SHOW. AND IT REALLY IS AN ENSEMBLE PIECE. SO, IT REALLY ALLOWS ALL THESE WOMEN TO REALLY SHINE AND TELL THE STORY OF LIBERIAN WOMEN IN THIS VERY, VERY VICIOUS CIVIL WAR THAT HAPPENED AND REALLY CELEBRATE THEIR PERSONHOOD AND HOW THEY NAVIGATED SURVIVAL. BUT THERE ARE MOMENTS OF LEVITY AS WELL.
Jimmy: SURE, WELL, THERE HAS TO BE. AND IT'S AT THE PUBLIC THEATER FROM NOW UNTIL SUNDAY?
UNTIL SUNDAY, AND THEN IT STARTS NEXT YEAR -- EARLY NEXT YEAR ON BROADWAY.
Jimmy: BROADWAY, YEAH. CONGRATULATIONS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, SPEAKING OF BROADWAY BIG TIME -- YOU'RE PROBABLY USED TO BIG TIME NOW, BECAUSE "THE WALKING DEAD" IS THE BIGGEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO THE UNITED STATES -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -- TO THE WORLD, SINCE "STAR WARS." YEAH, IT'S THE BIGGEST THING EVER. I MEAN, YOU HAD THE PREMIERE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.
YEAH, THAT WAS PRETTY TRIPPY. I HAD BEEN THERE, LIKE, ABOUT A A MONTH AND A HALF BEFORE WATCHING BONO AND U2, GOING "OH, MY GOD." AND LIKE SINGING "WITH OR WITHOUT YOU" LIKE A MORON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND NOW --
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AT THOSE CONCERTS.
RIGHT, I WAS SO LIKE FREAKED OUT.
Jimmy: SCREAMING.
AND SCREAMING LIKE A KID. AND THEN THERE I WAS ON THE STAGE, WATCHING THE PREMIERE OF THE SHOW. SO, IT WAS KIND OF AMAZING.
Jimmy: WELL, IT'S SO EXCITING TO HAVE YOU HERE. AND OBVIOUSLY COME BACK, YOU KNOW, WHENEVER YOU WANT TO OR WHEN YOU'RE ON BROADWAY.
THANK YOU.
