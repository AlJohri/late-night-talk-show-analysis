Questlove: 534, WISCONSIN! YEAH!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HI, EVERYONE! WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON, OF COURSE. WE HAVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, DONALD TRUMP ON THE SHOW TONIGHT, WHICH MEANS -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHICH MEANS SECURITY IS VERY TIGHT. ON THEIR WAY IN, EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE HAD TO PUT THEIR KEYS INTO A TRAY AND THEIR DEPLORABLES INTO A BASKET. [ LAUGHTER ] IT TOOK FOREVER. IT TOOK A LONG TIME. [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK FOR TRUMP. EARLIER TODAY, HE APPEARED ON "DR. OZ" AND SAID THAT HE WANTS TO LOSE ABOUT 15 POUNDS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND HIS BARBER SAID, "HEY, COME BY ANY TIME YOU LIKE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JUST GIVE ME TIME TO SWEEP UP AND CLOSE IT. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THESE LEAKED E-MAILS FROM FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, COLIN POWELL. DID YOU SEE THESE THINGS? IN ONE, HE ACTUALLY CALLED DICK CHENEY AN IDIOT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CHENEY WAS VERY HURT. IN FACT, HE SAID THE COMMENTS BROKE HIS LATEST HEART. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BRING IN THE COOLER HEART. POWELL ACTUALLY TOOK SHOTS AT SEVERAL POLITICIANS IN HIS E-MAILS. FOR INSTANCE, HE CALLED DONALD TRUMP A DISASTER, AND SAID HILLARY CLINTON SCREWS UP EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT DIDN'T END THERE. IT SEEMED LIKE POWELL HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH OTHER PEOPLE. I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. FIRST HE WROTE, "THERE GOES ADELE SINGING ABOUT ANOTHER BREAK-UP. IT'S CALLED WINE, HONEY. MERLOT AND MOVE ON." [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WHAT? WOW. WOULD NOT ACCEPT THAT.
Jimmy: MERLOT AND MOVE ON.
Steve: AND MOVE ON.
Jimmy: THIS NEXT ONE, HE SAYS, "WHAT'S WITH THIS PUTIN-TRUMP BROMANCE? I HALF EXPECT TO SEE YOU TWO IN A COUPLE OF OUTDOOR BATHTUBS LIKE THAT CIALIS AD."
Steve: WOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, CATTY.
Steve: CATTY. HE'S REALLY GOING FOR IT.
Jimmy: FINALLY, HE WROTE, "POKEMON GO, TRY POKEMON WENT. #OVERIT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] #OVERIT.
Steve: HE'S SENDING AN -- IN THE E-MAIL HE'S DOING HASHTAGS?
Jimmy: LOOKS LIKE HE HASHTAGGED HIS E-MAIL. [ LAUGHTER ] OH YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
Steve: HE'S GOING FOR IT, MAN.
Jimmy: WELL, HE'S JUST GOOFING WITH BUDDIES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OVER ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, I SAW THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS FEATURED IN THE UPCOMING ISSUE OF "WOMEN'S HEALTH" MAGAZINE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHILE NEXT MONTH SHE'LL BE FEATURED IN "BAD TIMING" MAGAZINE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "WOMEN'S HEALTH"? FAMOUSLY -- OH, A DISASTER. DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? YESTERDAY, THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI SUGGESTED THAT PEOPLE PUT TAPE OVER THEIR LAPTOP WEBCAMS TO AVOID BEING SPIED ON. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED, BECAUSE LAST NIGHT I WENT HOME AND I PUT TAPE ON MY WEBCAM, AND THEN I HEARD MY NEIGHBOR YELL, "OH, MAN!" [ LAUGHTER ] SOME NEWS FROM OVERSEAS, THE CHIEF OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS DISMISSING RUMORS THAT HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC AFTER HE WAS SEEN STAGGERING OUT OF A MEETING, SAYING HE JUST HAS A BALANCE PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HILLARY CLINTON WAS LIKE, "SURE, AND I WAS JUST OVERHEATED." YEAH. EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS RECENTLY SPOTTED IN MOSCOW TAKING SELFIES WITH A GROUP OF RUSSIAN BRIDES WHO WERE ABOUT TO GET MARRIED. THEN HE TOLD THE BRIDES, "OKAY, INTO THE MAIL YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ENOUGH SELFIES. ENJOY NEW LIFE IN FLORIDA." THIS IS INTERESTING, HERE. A NEW STUDY FINDS THAT IF YOU'RE DRUNK AROUND SOBER PEOPLE, YOU'LL THINK YOU'RE LESS DRUNK THAN IF YOU'RE AROUND OTHER DRUNK PEOPLE. AND IF YOU'RE DRUNK AROUND SOBER PEOPLE, CHANCES ARE YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] "HEY, WHO -- WHO WANTS TO ORDER SOME STRIPPERS?" "THIS IS A SALES MEETING, CARL." [ LAUGHTER ] "JUST ME, I GUESS?" [ HICCUPS ] NO ONE DOES THAT ANYMORE.
Steve: I KNOW.
Jimmy: DRUNK PEOPLE. HICCUPPING DRUNK. [ HICCUPS ] I JUST HAD TEE MARTOONIS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS PRETTY CRAZY COOL. I JUST READ ABOUT A A 100-YEAR-OLD TORTOISE NAMED DIEGO, WHO HAS SINGLEHANDEDLY SAVED HIS SPECIES FROM EXTINCTION BY FATHERING OVER 800 BABIES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JUST KEEP IN MIND, SOMEWHERE OUT THERE, THERE'S A TORTOISE THAT'S HAVING WAY MORE SEX THAN YOU ARE. [ APPLAUSE ] LET'S KEEP THAT IN MIND. YEAH. ♪♪ THAT'S RIGHT.
Steve: SHELL.
Jimmy: A 100-YEAR-OLD TORTOISE NAMED DIEGO IS BEING CREDITED WITH SAVING HIS SPECIES FROM EXTINCTION BY FATHERING OVER 800 BABIES. IT WASN'T EASY TO MEET AND REPRODUCE WITH ALL THOSE FEMALE TORTOISES, BUT LUCKILY, DIEGO USED SOME TORTOISE PICKUP LINES. FOR EXAMPLE, "WANT TO COME BACK TO MY HOUSE? I'M ACTUALLY WEARING IT RIGHT NOW." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THESE ARE TORTOISE PICKUP LINES.
Steve: THAT'S A TORTOISE PICKUP LINE. THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING THAT.
Jimmy: THEN HE SAID, "JUST TO BE SAFE, YOU'RE 118, RIGHT?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, HE SAID, "I'M A A TORTOISE ON THE STREETS, BUT A HARE IN THE SHEETS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT'S BEEN A GREAT WEEK SO FAR. THERE'S MORE AHEAD. TOMORROW NIGHT, THE ONE, THE ONLY MILEY CYRUS WILL BE HERE. MILEY.
Steve: HEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: MILEY AND I ARE GOING TO CATCH UP ABOUT HER NEW ROLE ON "THE VOICE", AND WE'RE GOING TO PLAY A FUN GAME TOGETHER. THEN SHE'S GOING TO PERFORM FOR US. SO BE SURE TO TUNE IN FOR THAT, IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT SHOW. PLUS ON MONDAY, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE STOPPING BY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND WE HAVE MUSIC FROM ARIANA GRANDE. IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT FIRST, YOU'RE ALL HERE ON A A HUUUGE NIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, DONALD TRUMP IS JOINING US TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PLUS, HE'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMEDIANS EVER, AND HE WROTE A A BOOK CALLED "BASED ON A TRUE STORY: A MEMOIR." [ LAUGHTER ] BASED ON -- IT'S HIS LIFE. NORM MACDONALD IS ON THE SHOW TONIGHT! NORM MACDONALD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FINALLY HAS A BOOK OUT. AND WE HAVE GREAT, GREAT MUSIC FROM KIIARA, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. SHE'S GOING TO BE ON TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOUNDS GOOD. SOME GOOD DANCE POP MUSIC. GUYS, IT IS TIME FOR "TONIGHT SHOW" HASHTAGS. HERE WE GO. ♪ HASTHTAGS HASHTAGS ♪
Jimmy: HERE WE GO. YOU GUYS ARE ON TWITTER, RIGHT? DO YOU USE TWITTER? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE USE TWITTER, ON OUR SHOW EVERY SINGLE WEEK, SO IF YOU WATCH OUR SHOW AND WANT TO PLAY ALONG, WE DO THIS THING EVERY WEDNESDAY WHERE I SEND OUT A A HASHTAG AND WE ASK -- LIKE COLIN POWELL WOULD DO.
Steve: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND WE ASK YOU GUYS TO TWEET OUT THINGS BASED ON THAT TOPIC. SO, SINCE SCHOOL IS BACK IN SESSION AND STUDENTS ARE GETTING TO KNOW THEIR TEACHERS, I WENT ON TWITTER AND SENT OUT A HASHTAG CALLED, "MY TEACHER IS WEIRD" AND ASKED YOU GUYS TO TWEET OUT SOMETHING FUNNY, WEIRD, OR EMBARRASSING ABOUT A A TEACHER THAT YOU'VE HAD. WE GOT THOUSANDS OF TWEETS. WITHIN 30 MINUTES IT WAS A A TRENDING TOPIC IN THE U.S., SO THANK YOU FOR THOSE TWEETS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW I THOUGHT I'D SHARE SOME OF MY FAVORITE "MY TEACHER IS WEIRD" TWEETS FROM YOU GUY. HERE WE GO. THIS FIRST ONE IS FROM @AMANDAROONEY. SHE SAYS, "ECONOMICS PROFESSOR WOULD WALK INTO CLASS AND SAY, 'ALL ABOARD THE ECONOMIC EXPRESS,' AND WE ALL HAD TO RESPOND WITH 'CHOO-CHOO!'" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: I LIKE IT.
Steve: TRAIN OF THOUGHT.
Jimmy: I THINK IT'S COOL. THAT'S GOOD. THIS ONE -- I'M JUST GONNA KEEP CHUGGING ALONG. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS ONE IS FROM @LEOXAVIERBP. HE SAYS, "DURING AN EXAM, MY TEACHER HELD UP A NEWSPAPER WITH WITH TWO HOLES IN IT AND HE SPENT THE WHOLE EXAM LOOKING AT US THROUGH THOSE HOLES." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WE CAN SEE YOU, RIGHT? NO CHEATING. THIS ONE'S FROM @KATTROTT. SHE SAYS, "DURING MY JUNIOR YEAR AT PERDUE, MY PROFESSOR FAKE KARATE KICKED A GUY FOR COMING IN LATE AND RIPPED HIS PANTS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST TRYING TO DO A BIT.
Steve: AW. OOPS.
Jimmy: THIS ONE'S FROM @TONYMAC84. HE SAYS, "I HAD AN ENGLISH TEACHER IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT PASSED OUT FROM USING THREE NICOTINE PATCHES AT ONCE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: THAT'LL DO IT.
Jimmy: HE HAD BALANCE PROBLEMS. HE JUST HAS A -- HE HAS A A BALANCE PROBLEM. THIS ONE'S FROM @JAMJARLIDS.
Steve: JAM JAR LIDS?
Jimmy: JAM JAR.
Steve: LIKE JAM JAR BINKS?
Jimmy: JAM JAR.
Steve: JAM JAR. I LOVE JAM JAR BINKS.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S JAR JAR BINKS, YOU MEAN.
Steve: OH, I THOUGHT IT WAS JAM JAR BINKS.
Jimmy: NO. SHE SAYS, "OUR CHOIR TEACHER TRIED TO CONVINCE US THAT HIS EVIL TWIN BROTHER WAS GOING TO SUB FOR HIM FOR A FEW WEEKS. IT WAS HIM IN A FAKE GOATEE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HE WAS JUST HAVING FUN, MAN.
Jimmy: HE SHOULD NOT BE TEACHING --
Steve: JUST TRYING TO KEEP IT ON THE REAL.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT -- THIS ONE'S FROM @ERINCHOSTYLES. SHE SAYS, "ALL OF MY SISTERS HAD THE SAME TEACHER. LAST DAY OF SENIOR YEAR, HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, 'PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE THE LAST ONE.'" [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE, HEY. RUDE.
Steve: RUDE.
Jimmy: THIS ONE IS FROM @BELLEOFBABBLE. SHE SAYS, "MY FIFTH GRADE TEACHER WOULD PUT ON BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY, THEN GLARE AT THE TV AND MUTTER, 'THAT COULD BE ME.'" [ LAUGHTER ] MY EVIL TWIN.

Jimmy: IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK TO THE SHOW. I APPRECIATE IT.
ALWAYS LOVE IT.
Jimmy: DONALD, THIS IS GETTING REAL. THIS IS --YEAH.
YES, THIS IS GETTING REAL, I AGREE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU STILL HAVE TIME. DO YOU STILL WANT TO DO THIS? I MEANT THERE'S TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
WE'RE DOING WELL. IT'S BEEN REALLY A LOT OF FUN AND IT'S AN AMAZING MOVEMENT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE, SO, NO, IT'S BEEN AN HONOR FOR ME, I HAVE TO SAY.
Jimmy: THERE'S PROBABLY KIDS WATCHING YOU RIGHT NOW AT HOME WATCHING. THEY DO STAY UP LATE AND WATCH OUR SHOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHY SHOULD THEY WANT TO GROW UP AND BE PRESIDENT?
WELL, I THINK YOU WANT TO GROW UP AND BE PRESIDENT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HELP PEOPLE AND YOU WANT TO HELP PEOPLE, THERE'S TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE AND ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND IF YOU WANT TO HELP PEOPLE, THERE'S NO BETTER POSITION TO DO IT FROM THAN THE PRESIDENCY. SO WE CAN DO A LOT OF GOOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DID YOU ALWAYS SEE YOURSELF -- DID YOU ALWAYS SEE YOURSELF GETTING INTO POLITICS?
I REALLY NEVER DID. I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE MANY OF THE SHOWS THAT I'VE DONE OVER THE YEARS IF I HAD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN. FOUR YEARS AGO, I REALLY, SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED IT. AND THEY RENEWED, AS YOU KNOW, THEY WANTED ME TO STAY AND DO "THE APPRENTICE" AND I WAS DOING ALL OF THESE JOBS AND -- BUT I REALLY WANTED TO DO IT AND ULTIMATELY I DECIDED I'D WAIT AND LET'S SEE HOW THINGS GO WITH THE COUNTRY AND THINGS ONLY GOT WORSE, AND I DECIDED TO DO IT. AND YOU KNOW, I GAVE UP A LOT BY DOING THIS. IT'S A TOUGH THING. THERE'S NOTHING EASY ABOUT IT. AND I'VE ALWAYS HEARD DOING THIS IS A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT THING, BUT NOBODY KNOWS HOW TOUGH IT IS.
Jimmy: IT IS, RIGHT. I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A LONG --
IT'S GRUELING. IT'S GRUELING AND -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME, VERY SATISFYING, YOU KNOW, YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON, SO IT'S VERY SATISFYING, BUT IT'S A GRUELING PROCESS.
Jimmy: DO YOU THINK YOUR BUSINESS BACKGROUND HELPS YOU WITH CAMPAIGNING? LIKE, LIKE, LIKE IF YOU HAVE, LIKE, YOU HAVE TO TARGET, LIKE, SAY YOU NEED WOMEN FROM 25 TO 40, THAT AGE GROUP, DO YOU TARGET THAT?
WELL, I THINK WHERE IT HELPS --. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? IS THAT TOO BUSINESS-Y?
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT.
Jimmy: I'M HALFWAY THROUGH YOUR BOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S PRETTY GOOD. IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT ONE SOON. BUT YOU KNOW, YEAH, I THINK BUSINESS WILL ALWAYS HELP. IT HELPS FROM A COUNTRY STANDPOINT. IT'S INTERESTING, WHEN I WAS DOING THE PRIMARIES, I SPENT LESS MONEY THAN OTHER PEOPLE AND I DID BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO FOR THE COUNTRY. WE WANT TO SPEND LESS MONEY AND DO BETTER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: TALKING ABOUT HOW LONG AND GRUELING IT IS, HAVE YOU SEEN -- WHAT HAS CHANGED FROM WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED RUNNING TO NOW?
WELL, I THINK THE PRESS HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE VICIOUS. I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN I HAD -- WE STARTED OFF WITH 17 AND YOU HAD SOME OF THEM IN HERE, AND ONE BY ONE BY ONE --.
Jimmy: WE HAD ABOUT 15.
YOU HAD ABOUT 15 ON HERE, NOT ALL 17, BUT YOU HAD A LOT OF THEM. BUT YOU KNOW, WE HAD 17 PEOPLE AND AS IT GOT DOWN, YOU KNOW, I DO NOTICE THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE WITH THE MEDIA. I ALSO SAY THOUGH THERE'S EVEN MORE LOVE OUT THERE. PEOPLE WANT THIS TO HAPPEN. THEY REALLY WANT IT TO HAPPEN AND YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON EVEN TODAY WITH THE POLLS WHERE THE POLLS ARE SO GOOD, WE JUST GOT A GREAT POLL FROM COLORADO, NORMALLY A REPUBLICAN WOULDN'T DO PARTICULARLY WELL THERE, AND WE'RE LEADING IN COLORADO AND WE'RE LEADING IN IOWA. WE'RE LEADING IN OHIO AND FLORIDA. WE'RE LEADING ALL OVER, AND IT'S BEEN AMAZING. IT'S BEEN REALLY AMAZING.
Jimmy: DO YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE POLLS?
OH, I LOVE THE POLLS.
Jimmy: YOU DO? [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT I DON'T PAY ATTENTION IF I'M LOSING OR LAGGING, I NEVER MENTION IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BELIEVE ME. ONLY WHEN I'M WINNING.
Jimmy: I'VE NOTICED THAT -- LITTLE CHANGES. I THINK YOUR VOICE HAS CHANGED A LITTLE BIT. BECAUSE I'VE DONE -- I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU, BUT I'VE DONE IMPRESSIONS OF YOU ONCE OR TWICE ON THIS SHOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU HAVE.
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME DO THAT.
A VERY GOOD IMPRESSION.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. BUT WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED RUNNING, YOU WERE VERY HIGH VICED. YOUR VOICE WAS VERY HIGH, AND CHINA, YOU'D SAY CHINA AND A A LOT -- VERY HIGH. AND THEN YOU'VE GOTTEN TO A A STAGE WHERE YOU WERE JUST YELLING. YOU WERE YELLING INTO THE MICROPHONE AT PEOPLE AND YOU WERE YELLING AT EVERYONE! AND LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN NEED THE MIC. AND NOW YOU'RE MORE OF LIKE A A SMOKY, SILKY -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LIKE A DONALD TRUMP/ALEC BALDWIN IMPRESSION TYPE OF VOICE. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I GOT TO KINDLY THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE MATERIAL THAT WE'RE DOING. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S BEEN AMAZING TO FOLLOW AND EXCITING BECAUSE YOU SAY THE MOST SHOCKING THINGS. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE.
BUT I'M TRYING NOT TO ANYMORE.
Jimmy: YEAH, OH YEAH. YES. SEE, THAT'S CHANGING. YEAH. SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, SO, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DO SOMETHING, BECAUSE EVERYONE'S SAYING, OH, IS THERE A BROMANCE BETWEEN VLADIMIR PUTIN AND ALL THIS STUFF AND WHAT IS THE CELEBRITY NICKNAME FOR YOU GUYS AND I THOUGHT OF VLUMP. VLUMP I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU SAID, "IF HE SAYS GREAT THINGS ABOUT ME, I'LL SAY GREAT THINGS ABOUT HIM."
WELL, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW HIM. AND I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM, REALLY. I JUST THINK IF WE GOT ALONG WITH RUSSIA, THAT'S NOT A BAD THING AND GETTING ALONG WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, THE DEMOCRATS TRY TO SAY I LIKE HIM SOMEHOW. I DON'T LIKE HIM. I DON'T DISLIKE HIM. I DON'T HAVE ANY FEELINGS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT ME. IF HE SAYS GOOD THINGS OR BAD THINGS ABOUT ME, I'M GOING TO MAKE GREAT DEALS FOR OUR COUNTRY. I'M INTERESTED IN OUR COUNTRY. I'M INTERESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF OUR COUNTRY. AND RIGHT NOW, I MEAN, YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING JUST GENERALLY SPEAKING, AND WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO, BUT THEY DO TRY AND PIN ME INTO THIS, AND I'M SAYING TO MYSELF, YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM. ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU KNOW, THEY MAKE IT LIKE HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. I DON'T KNOW HIM. WHAT I WANT IS WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS TO ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: FIRST DEBATE -- FIRST DEBATE IS SEPTEMBER 26 AT HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY. LESTER HOLT'S IS MODERATING. YOU DON'T TRADITIONALLY PREPARE FOR THE DEBATES.
WELL, I PREPARE. I MEAN I CERTAINLY PREPARE. I NEVER DEBATED BEFORE THE OTHER 11 DEBATES. I WAS IN 11 DEBATES, YOU KNOW, IN THE PRIMARY SYSTEM. AND I LOVED IT. I REALLY LIKED DOING IT, BUT I NEVER DEBATED PROFESSIONALLY OR FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT BEFORE, BUT I ENJOYED THAT PROCESS. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT DEBATE, AND LESTER IS THE MODERATOR. I THINK IT'S VERY TOUGH FOR LESTER BECAUSE FRANKLY I THOUGHT MATT LAUER DID A A FANTASTIC JOB AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GAME THE SYSTEM BY SAYING TRUMP WON THE DEBATE BECAUSE MATT LAUER WASN'T AS TOUGH ON TRUMP AS HE WAS ON HILLARY CLINTON. AND THAT WASN'T IT. I MEAN HE WAS TOUGH ON ME AND HE WAS TOUGH ON HER. BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT SO THAT LESTER'S GOING TO COME OUT AND REALLY BE TOUGH ON ME. AND I THINK IT'S UNFAIR. I MEAN THEY'RE TRYING TO GAIN THE SYSTEM. SO I SAID, LET'S NOT HAVE A A MODERATOR. REMEMBER THE FAMOUS -- YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER THIS, OF COURSE. ABRAHAM LINCOLN/DOUGLAS. REMEMBER THE LINCOLN/DOUGLASS DEBATES?
Jimmy: ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I WATCH IT ALL THE TIME ON YOUTUBE. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO MODERATOR. NO MODERATOR. I WOULD HAVE LIKE TO HAVE SEEN THAT. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE QUITE THE DEBATE.
Jimmy: BUT WHO WOULD GO FIRST? WHO WOULD TALK FIRST.
WELL I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: FLIP A COIN? DO YOU KNOW WHAT A COIN IS, BY THE WAY? [ LAUGHTER ] A COIN IS TINY, BEAUTIFUL THING. I GOT TO -- I GOT TO SHOW YOU. I'LL GIVE YOU A COIN BACKSTAGE. YOU'LL LOVE THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YEAH.
NO, BUT THE CONCEPT OF HAVING US BOTH SITTING ON STAGE OR STANDING ON STAGE, I LIKE STANDING MUCH BETTER. BUT STANDING ON STAGE AND JUST DEBATING, YOU KNOW, THEY USED TO DO DEBATES THAT WAY.
Jimmy: RIGHT.
I THINK IT WOULD BE FASCINATING FOR PEOPLE. I THINK IT WOULD BE FASCINATING. BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OUTSIDE PRESSURE BEING PLACED ON LESTER THAT IS UNFAIR, BUT I THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO ME, BUT THAT'S OKAY. BUT I THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO LESTER.
Jimmy: YEAH, BECAUSE HE'S GOT TO REALLY GOT TO OVER PREPARE, I GUESS.
HE'S GOT TO HAMMER ME, AND I THINK THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
Jimmy: RIGHT.
BUT MATT, I HAVE TO SAY, I THOUGHT MATT LAUER DID A A FANTASTIC JOB IN THAT DEBATE.
Jimmy: WE LOVE HIM. WE LOVE MATT LAUER. WE'RE A FAN OF MATT LAUER HERE TOO. YOU'VE -- YOU SAID ON OUR SHOW BEFORE THAT YOU'VE NEVER REALLY APOLOGIZE UNTIL -- UNLESS YOU REALLY FEEL THE NEED TO APOLOGIZE.
I DON'T LOVE APOLOGIZING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT -- I'M NOT THRILLED ABOUT APOLOGIZING. BUT I'LL APOLOGIZE IF I'M WRONG ABOUT SOMETHING.
Jimmy: YEAH. HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED THE BOARD GAME, SORRY? [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, I SORT OF LIKE MONOPOLY BETTER THAN THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. I SEE THAT. YEAH. WHAT'S YOUR GO-TO PROPERTY?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I THINK MAYBE -- MAYBE FIFTH AVENUE.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH? IS THERE A FIFTH AVENUE?
NO, BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE.
Jimmy: IN REAL LIFE. YOU'RE PLAYING MONOPOLY IN REAL LIFE. YEAH, WE PLAY DIFFERENT MONOPOLIES. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] HILLARY GETTING SICK. YOU HANDLED THAT VERY WELL, SAYING I HOPE SHE GETS BETTER. HAVE YOU GOTTEN CLOSE TO GETTING SICK THROUGH THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN?
IS THIS WOOD OR IS THIS FORMICA?
Jimmy: IT'S WOOD. IT'S A VENEER.
NO, I HAVEN'T. I'VE REALLY BEEN -- WELL WE'RE GOING, IN FACT, RIGHT AFTER THIS, WE'RE GOING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE WE'RE MAKING A SPEECH UP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WE HAVE A A BIG CROWD AND I JUST GOT BACK FROM OHIO AND WE WERE IN PENNSYLVANIA AND FLORIDA WE'RE ALL OVER.
Jimmy: HOW DO YOU NOT GET SICK?
I DON'T KNOW. BY NOT THINKING ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: SORRY ABOUT THAT. SORRY TO BRING IT UP. I DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN.
JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. SO FAR --
Jimmy: I DON'T GET SICK EITHER DOING THE SHOW BUT USUALLY ON VACATIONS I GET SICK.
WHEN YOU TAKE IT EASY, IT'S NOT SO GOOD. NO I HAVEN'T AND I'VE HAD --WE'VE HAD A VERY GRUELING SCHEDULE. WE'VE HAD AN AMAZING SCHEDULE FROM ONE STATE TO THE NEXT. SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR A DAY, AND SO FAR, I'M, YOU KNOW, STAYING STRONG.
Jimmy: AND IT'S NOT TRUE, RIGHT, THAT I'VE READ THAT YOU JUST -- YOU EAT FAST FOOD ALL THE TIME.
WELL, I EAT IT A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE'RE TRAVELING BECAUSE WE'LL BE ON THE PLANE AND I -- YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE A BIG THING TO PRESERVE. THEY HAVE A NAME, WHETHER IT'S McDONALD'S OR WENDY'S OR ANY OF THEM, AND AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING. I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO A A RESTAURANT AND SAYS, MR. TRUMP WOULD LIKE A A HAMBURGER TO GO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO TO THAT HAMBURGER. IF THEY LIKE ME, I'M HAPPY. IF THEY DON'T LIKE ME -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THEY'RE GOING TO SPIT IN THE BURGER, YEAH. EXACTLY. I HAVE TO TELL YOU I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT.
I'M BETTER OFF WITH FAST FOOD.
Jimmy: MORE WITH DONALD TRUMP WHEN WE COME BACK, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE DONALD TRUMP, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW, THIS IS INTERESTING. MR. TRUMP, IF ELECTED, YOU WOULD BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT FROM NEW YORK CITY SINCE TEDDY ROOSEVELT.
WOW.
Jimmy: AND THE FIRST PRESIDENT FROM NEW YORK CITY SINCE FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT.

Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT COMPANY, YEAH. UH -- UH -- YOU'RE FROM QUEENS.

NOT TOO MUCH, NO. MY PARENTS WERE VERY STRICT AND GOOD AND LOVING. THEY WERE FANTASTIC PARENTS.
Jimmy: OH, SORRY, I'M MAKING YOU WISTFUL. YEAH, SORRY FOR THAT, BUDDY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S CHOKING ME UP A LITTLE BIT. LAST TIME WE WERE HERE, WE DID A MOCK JOB INTERVIEW BECAUSE THIS IS THE BIGGEST JOB IN THE WORLD, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. CAN WE CONTINUE THAT INTERVIEW AND FINISH IT? BECAUSE NOW WE'RE ONLY DOWN TO TWO CANDIDATES.
SURE, OKAY.
Jimmy: CLIPBOARD HERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T KNOW IF I LIKE THIS.
Jimmy: WHY WOULD YOU EXCEL AT THIS JOB?
BECAUSE I LOVE PEOPLE, AND I WANT TO DO RIGHT FOR PEOPLE.
Jimmy: OKAY. [ APPLAUSE ] HOW WOULD YOUR COWORKERS, PEERS DESCRIBE YOU? [ LAUGHTER ]
AS SOMEBODY WHO NEVER GIVES UP. WE NEVER GIVE UP -- WE CAN NEVER GIVE UP, RIGHT?
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO OUTSIDE OF WORK? DO YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES?
I DON'T HAVE ANY TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE ENJOYED THIS. THIS HAS BEEN VERY -- I REALLY DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. NO, HONESTLY, THIS HAS BEEN, LIKE, 24 HOURS A DAY. WE HAVE JUST GONE ALL-OUT. YOU HAVE TO LOVE YOUR FAMILY AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT WE HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME. IT'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: WHY DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE YOUR CURRENT JOB?
BECAUSE I'M SORT OF LOOKING TO MAKE A LOT LESS MONEY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] A LOT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A PAY CUT, I'M SORRY. YEAH. FINALLY, WHAT WILL YOU DO IF YOU DON'T GET THIS POSITION?
YOU KNOW, I THINK I WANT TO, MORE THAN ANYTHING EVER, I WANT TO TAKE OVER "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT'S NOT AVAILABLE.
THAT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.
Jimmy: DONALD, I WANT TO ASK YOU BECAUSE THE NEXT TIME I SEE YOU, YOU -- YOU-- COULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I JUST WANTED TO NOTE, THERE'S SOMETHING WE COULD DO THAT'S JUST NOT PRESIDENTIAL REALLY, OR SOMETHING, THAT WE CAN DO NOW THAT WE'RE JUST BOTH CIVILIANS. LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: HEY. NICE TO SEE YOU, BUDDY.
NICE TO SEE YOU, SIR. THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE, MAN.
Jimmy: THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE, RIGHT?
MY GOODNESS. TALKING ABOUT THE LINCOLN/DOUGLAS DEBATES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
I REMEMBER THOSE DEBATES BECAUSE I REMEMBER IF YOU WERE THERE, LINCOLN WON. BUT IF YOU WERE AT HOME AND NEVER HEARD IT ALL, PEOPLE WOULD GO FOR DOUGLAS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT WAS THE TIME LINCOLN DIDN'T SHAVE EITHER.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, HE HAD A A BEARD. YEAH.
BUT IT WAS AMAZING MEETING DONALD TRUMP BACKSTAGE. MY LORD, WHAT A LARGER THAN LIFE CHARACTER. AND I SHOOK HIS HAND, BIGGEST HANDS I'VE EVER SHOOK IN MY LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE ANDRE THE GIANT OR --
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
-- JOHNNY BENCH WITH HIS CATCHING MITT ON.
Jimmy: JOHNNY BENCH WITH HIS CATCHER'S MITT ON.
I MEAN, MY GOD, DONALD TRUMP. BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, I WAS -- I'M NOT USUALLY A POLITICAL PERSON.
Jimmy: SURE.
AND I HATE TO SAY THIS WITH MR. TRUMP IN THE BUILDING, BUT I GOT TO MAKE A STAND AND I SAY THAT IF HE WINS, AS THE PRESIDENT, I VOW, HERE ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW," THAT I WILL MOVE TO A DIFFERENT APARTMENT. I WILL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE THAT YOU'RE IN NOW?
DIFFERENT.
Jimmy: YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST.
LIKE MAYBE IN CHINATOWN.
Jimmy: YEAH -- YEAH, YOU'RE ALREADY FROM CANADA.
I AM FROM CANADA. I CAN'T VOTE. I VOTED FOR JUSTIN TRUDEAU.
Jimmy: YEAH, THERE YOU GO. I DUG THAT GUY.
OH, MY GOD. HE'S -- HE'S IN MY BOOK, "BASED ON A TRUE STORY."
Jimmy: YOU BROUGHT YOUR OWN BOOK.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I HAVE IT OUT HERE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO -- BUT YOU -- I HAVE THE SAME ONE. I HAVE A SIMILAR COPY. I HAVE A SIMILAR COPY. BUT THIS IS -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
WE'VE GOT TWICE AS MANY BOOKS.
Jimmy: IS IT EASY WRITING YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY? OR IS IT --
WELL, I TELL YOU, YOU KNOW UH -- SOMEONE ONCE SAID, "A LIFE UNEXAMINED IS NOT WORTH LIVING."
Jimmy: YEAH.
I MEAN IT WAS SOCRATES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, SOMEONE.
BUT UH, IT TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU KNOW, WHAT DOES SOCRATES KNOW? BUT HE UM -- HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS. YOU SIT DOWN, YOU GO OKAY, YOU TRY TO EXAMINE YOUR LIFE, YOU GO OKAY, I WAKE UP, I EAT SOME COUNT CHOCULA. [ LAUGHTER ] I -- I WATCH THE GALS FROM "THE VIEW." BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE A HOOT.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE THEY ARE.
AND -- AND I PHONE MY FRIEND. I GO, I GOT TO GET -- YOU WANT TO GET SOME LUNCH? I'VE ALMOST DIGESTED MY COUNT CHOCULA. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I -- AT LUNCH, I'M THINKING ABOUT, WHO THE HELL AM I GOING TO EAT DINNER WITH?
Jimmy: THAT'S A DAY.
ISN'T ALMOST ALL YOUR LIFE FINDING AND EATING FOOD? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. IT REALLY IS.
SO I THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE FOR NOT A GOOD READ.
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT?
NO. SO ANYWAYS, I TOOK -- YOU KNOW, I TOOK OFF. YOU KNOW, I DECIDED TO HAVE BOMB SHELLS -- I KNEW I NEEDED BOMB SHELLS FOR THIS KIND OF A BOOK. IT'S NOT A TELL-ALL. IT'S A -- TELL-SOME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S INTERESTING. YEAH.
IT'S A WORD I COINED.
Jimmy: OUT OF THE WHOLE BOOK, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF IT IS TRUE?
I "KERNED."
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU KERNED THAT TERM.
HOW MUCH OF THE BOOK, PERCENTAGE-WISE IS TRUE?
Jimmy: YEAH.
50% TRUE, 70% FALSE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: VERY INTERESTING. WHAT DO YOU -- WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN YOUR BOOK? DO YOU HAVE A RECEIPT OR SOMETHING IN THERE?
OH, THIS? NO, THIS, I THOUGHT MR. TRUMP WAS HERE AND HE WAS ON DR. OZ AND HE RELEASED HIS MEDICAL RECORDS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I DECIDED, AS, YOU KNOW, ENTERTAINER IN CHIEF --.
Jimmy: DID YOU "KERN" THAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, I "KERNED" THAT TERM. I DECIDED THAT I WOULD RELEASE MY -- I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY, YES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS, NORM.
I KNOW, BUT I FEEL THAT IT'S -- IT'S MY DUTY. NOW, I WILL SAY, I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE I'VE NOT LOOKED AT THIS. MY DOCTOR GAVE IT TO ME DIRECTLY BEFORE THE SHOW.
Jimmy: IT'S A SEALED ENVELOPE.
SEALED ENVELOPE IN THE FRONT OF PORK -- FUNK AND WAGNALL'S -- MY MEMORY'S GONE, BABY.
Jimmy: OH, NO, NO.
OKAY, SO, HERE IT IS. OKAY. IT'S ONLY ONE PAGE. HE GAVE ME A BLANK PAGE.
Jimmy: WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR IS THIS?
"I CAN ATTEST THAT MR. MAC DONALD'S BLOOD PRESSURE IS AN ASTONISHINGLY EXCELLENT 120/80."
Jimmy: HEY, FANTASTIC. THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S GOOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
"MR. MACDONALD HAS THE PHYSICAL ENDURANCE OF TEN MEN HALF HIS AGE."
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
"MR. MACDONALD'S SPLEEN IS, I WANT TO SAY, GOOD."
Jimmy: YOUR SPLEEN IS, OKAY, I WANT TO SAY GOOD.
"HIS PANCREAS IS --" AND THEN HE JUST DREW A WINKY FACE.
Jimmy: OH, NO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOOD OR NOT. OH, OH. I HAVE -- I GOT MY RESULT FROM MY PAP SMEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] I PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS. YEAH.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS. [ APPLAUSE ]
THEY -- THEY SMEARED MY PAP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MAN.
"NORM MACDONALD'S LIVER IS FANTASTIC." OH, "JUST KIDDING, IT'S BLACK AND NECROTIC." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. THAT'S BAD. WHY WOULD HE JOKE LIKE THAT? HE'S A DOCTOR.
WHAT KIND OF JOKE IS THAT? "JUST KIDDING." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. "HIS URINE TEST --."
Jimmy: OH. >>"-- INDICATES THAT MR. MACDONALD HAS --" OH MY GOD. OH, IT SAYS, "HE IS MORE VIRUS THAN HOST." [ LAUGHTER ] OH, MY GOLLY. AND IT SAYS, "MR. MACDONALD HAS ONE HOUR TO LIVE."
Jimmy: OH MY --
OH, THIS IS TERRIBLE NEWS. OH, WAIT. NO. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I JUST REMEMBERED, I DIDN'T USE MY OWN URINE FOR THE TEST. YEAH, YEAH, BECAUSE OF THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF STEROIDS I USE FOR BODY BUILDING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO YOU USED SOMEONE ELSE'S URINE?
I USED MY BUDDY'S URINE INSTEAD, THIS IS GREAT. WHAT A GREAT DAY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. NO, NO. THIS IS BAD. NORM, YOUR BUDDY HAS ONE HOUR TO LIVE.
OH.
Jimmy: DON'T YOU WANT TO CALL HIM?
OH, I'LL CALL HIM. GOLLY, HE ONLY HAS ONE HOUR TO LIVE. YOU KNOW, I WANT HIM TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.
