[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. LET'S KICK OFF THE WEEK. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. BIG NEWS OVER THE WEEKEND. ON FRIDAY, DONALD TRUMP AGREED TO SETTLE HIS TRUMP UNIVERSITY LAWSUITS FOR $25 MILLION. THEN ON SATURDAY, HE CALLED THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND SAID, "I'D LIKE TO MAKE A A WITHDRAWAL. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT HOW THIS WORKS?" [ APPLAUSE ] GET THIS. DONALD TRUMP CLAIMED THAT HE DECIDED TO SETTLE THE TRUMP UNIVERSITY LAWSUIT SO HE COULD FOCUS ON RUNNING THE COUNTRY. THEN HE WENT BACK TO TWEETING INSULTS AT THE CAST OF "HAMILTON." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY FIRST. DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT MIKE PENCE WENT TO SEE "HAMILTON" OVER THE WEEKEND AND HE WAS BOOED BY PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHEN HE ENTERED THE THEATER. IF THE CROWD WASN'T MAD ENOUGH ALREADY, PENCE WAITED UNTIL A A QUIET SCENE TO OPEN UP A BAG OF SKITTLES. AND YOU GO, "COME ON, WHAT IS THIS GUY DOING? COME ON!" [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS PRETTY INTERESTING HERE. AFTER MIKE PENCE WAS BOOED AT "HAMILTON," DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THAT HE HEARD THAT THE SHOW WAS, QUOTE, "HIGHLY OVERRATED." [ LAUGHTER ] AS IT TURNS OUT, TRUMP HAS ACTUALLY TWEETED A LOT ABOUT OTHER BROADWAY SHOWS AS WELL. FOR INSTANCE, HE TWEETED, "JUST SAW 'RENT,' SUCH A SAD STORY. I TEARED UP WHEN THE LANDLORD DIDN'T EVICT THOSE KIDS."
Steve: WOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WOW.
Jimmy: ANOTHER TIME, TRUMP TWEETED, "CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST WASTED TWO HOURS WATCHING 'HAIRSPRAY.' ONLY WENT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT ME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO, "HAIRSPRAY."

WAIT, WHERE IS EVERYBODY? [ LAUGHTER ] GUYS! GUYS, I JUST MET PRESIDENT OBAMA." [ APPLAUSE ] SOME MORE THANKSGIVING NEWS, I READ THAT 15 MILLION AMERICANS WILL EAT AT A RESTAURANT ON THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR. BECAUSE WHEN YOUR FAMILY STARTS ARGUING ABOUT POLITICS ON THANKSGIVING, THE FIRST THING YOU THINK IS, "WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS IN PUBLIC." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
