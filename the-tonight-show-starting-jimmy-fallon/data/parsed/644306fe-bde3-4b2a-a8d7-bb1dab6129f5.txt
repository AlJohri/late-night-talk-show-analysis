YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE IT'S THE ELECTION, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA ACTUALLY SAID YESTERDAY THAT IF THINGS GET BETTER UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE'LL BE THE FIRST TO CONGRATULATE HIM. WELL, TECHNICALLY, HE'LL BE THE SECOND BECAUSE TRUMP WILL CONGRATULATE HIMSELF FIRST. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ AS TRUMP ] "I DID SUCH A GREAT JOB. I REALLY DID." [ LAUGHTER ] GET THIS, I READ THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T WANT TO LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE FULL-TIME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND -- YEAH. AND HE'S THINKING ABOUT COMMUTING FROM NEW YORK CITY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S ALL PART OF TRUMP'S PLAN TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND TO MAKE TRAFFIC IN NEW YORK CITY WORSE THAN EVER. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE A NIGHTMARE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ AS TRUMP ] "I REALLY DID A GOOD JOB." TRUMP APPARENTLY WANTS TO COMMUTE TO WASHINGTON, D.C., BY HELICOPTER. TRUMP ASKED THE PILOT IF HE'S GOT THOSE RADIO HEADPHONES SO THEY CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER IN THE AIR AND THE PILOT WAS LIKE, "NOPE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "GOT TO GET ONE OF THOSE, HA HA." THIS IS REALLY CRAZY. DONALD TRUMP HAS REPORTEDLY ASKED FOR HIS ADULT CHILDREN TO GET TOP LEVEL SECURITY CLEARANCE SO THAT THEY CAN SEE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND EXPLAIN THEM TO HIM.

Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: GUYS, I READ THAT NEBRASKA SENATOR BEN SASSE MOONLIGHTS AS AN UBER DRIVER. YEAH. YOU MIGHT THINK THAT HAVING A A SECOND JOB WHEN YOU'RE A A U.S. SENATOR IS RARE. BUT WE DISCOVERED THAT MANY SENATORS ACTUALLY HAVE OTHER JOBS.

[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OH, THIS HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE UPSET. TINDER WENT DOWN LAST NIGHT. MANY PEOPLE SAID THE CRASH DELETED ALL THEIR MATCHES. THEN THEIR FRIENDS SAID, "YEAH, KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TINDER CRASH? NO ONE -- NO ONE'S SWIPING FOR ME, MAN.

NEW STUDY FINDS THAT ALMOST 30% OF PEOPLE SAY THEY CAN'T GET A A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP BECAUSE OF SHARING A BED WITH THEIR PARTNER.

HIS NEW MEMOIR, "TESTIMONY", IS IN STORES NOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME ROBBIE ROBERTSON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: YOU'RE DRAWN TO THE MUSIC.
YEAH, IT'S KIND OF AN AUTOMATIC REFLEX.
Jimmy: DUDE, YOU'RE THE COOLEST OF ALL COOL. LOOK AT THIS RIGHT HERE. "TESTIMONY." THIS BOOK IS FANTASTIC. JANN WENNER, WHO CREATED "ROLLING STONE", SAID THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS ON ROLL AND ROLL EVER WRITTEN. THAT'S HIGH PRAISE. NOT BAD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO FUN. I LOVED IT. I LOVED IT SO MUCH AND YOU KNOW I'M A GIANT FAN OF YOURS. I AM FROM SAUGERTIES, NEW YORK.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: THAT'S MY HOMETOWN, UPSTATE, AND WE -- IT'S REQUIRED LISTENING TO HAVE THE BAND BE PART OF YOUR REPERTOIRE. LIKE EVERYONE HAS YOUR CDs. BIG PINK WAS THE NAME OF THE HOUSE WHERE YOU RECORDED --
"THE BASEMENT TAPES."
Jimmy: "THE BASEMENT TAPES" WITH DYLAN.
AND THAT'S WHERE "MUSIC FROM BIG PINK" WAS BORN.
Jimmy: THIS IS IT. DO YOU REMEMBER?
IT STILL IS UGLY AS IT WAS THEN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I REMEMBER -- THIS WAS IN WEST SAUGERTIES, RIGHT?
YEP.
Jimmy: I REMEMBER TELLING MY PARENTS, BECAUSE IT WAS FOR SALE WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I GO, "WE SHOULD BUY BIG PINK AND TURN IT INTO A MUSEUM AND, LIKE, THAT'S HOW WE'LL MAKE MONEY." AND MY PARENTS WERE LIKE, "WE DON'T HAVE MONEY." [ LAUGHTER ] "WE CAN'T JUST BUY ANOTHER HOUSE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?" BUT I JUST LOVE THAT -- WHY DID YOU PICK SAUGERTIES? HOW DID YOU GET THERE?
WELL, WE HAD COME FROM THE CITY, FROM NEW YORK, TO FIND A A PLACE WHERE WE WOULDN'T BE DISTURBING ANYBODY. EVERY TIME WE TRIED TO MAKE MUSIC, SOMEBODY WOULD BE BANGING ON THE WALLS SAYING, "HEY, TURN IT DOWN IN THERE." AND -- AND I REALLY FELT I HAD THIS YEARNING TO HAVE A A WORKPLACE, A SANCTUARY. SOMEWHERE THAT WE COULD GO AND MAKE ALL THE MUSIC WE WANTED AND NOBODY WOULD SAY ANYTHING, AND WE FOUND IT. IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A A HUNDRED ACRES. AND SO WE WENT THERE AND SPENT SO MUCH TIME MAKING MUSIC. THE AMOUNT OF NOISE THAT CAME OUT OF THAT PLACE IS -- I'M TELLING YOU, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
Jimmy: WAS THAT THE SECRET TO THE BAND, YOU THINK? I MEAN, BECAUSE YOU WERE ALREADY GREAT. YOU WERE THE HAWKS RIGHT?
YEAH. BUT THIS WAS WHEN WE HAD TO -- TO MAKE OUR DISCOVERY. WE HAD PLAYED -- YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID, WHEN I WAS 16, I JOINED RONNIE HAWKINS AND THE HAWKS. THEN IT WAS THE HAWKS. AND THEN LEVON AND THE HAWKS. AND THEN WE HOOKED UP WITH BOB DYLAN. AND THEN AFTER THAT, IT WAS TIME FOR US TO MAKE OUR MOVE. AND OUR MOVE, WE NEEDED TO FIND A WORKSHOP, A CLUBHOUSE, WHERE WE COULD GO AND DISCOVER EVERYTHING. AND WE COULD MAKE THIS BIG GUMBO OF MUSIC FROM ALL THE THINGS WE HAD GATHERED OVER THE YEARS.
Jimmy: AND FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR SOUND IS.
AND THIS WAS THE PLACE THAT IT CAME OUT OF.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE THE BEST STORIES IN HERE. I WILL ALSO SAY THE PAPER STOCK IS VERY HIGH QUALITY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT REALLY IS.
NICE TOUCH.
Jimmy: GREAT TOUCH TO IT. WHOEVER DID THOUGHT OF THAT, GOOD MOVE. I'VE GOT SO MANY STORIES. ONE OF THE ONES I LOVE IN HERE IS YOU HEARING VELVET UNDERGROUND FOR THE FIRST TIME. WHERE WERE YOU?
MAX'S.
Jimmy: KANSAS CITY.
MAX'S KANSAS CITY, YEAH. THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON IN THE STREETS THAN MUSIC. YOU KNOW, YOU GO INTO ONE PLACE AND JIMI HENDRIX WOULD BE PLAYING. THE VELVET UNDERGROUND WOULD BE HERE. VAN MORRISON WOULD BE OVER IT WAS JUST EVERYWHERE. BUT THE VELVETS PLAYED THAT NIGHT. AND THEY PLAYED, AND IT SEEMED TO ME, BECAUSE IN OUR GROUP, WE'VE BEEN AROUND. WE'D BEEN PLAYING THE CHITLIN CIRCUIT DOWN SOUTH AND ALL OVER AND WOOD SHEDDING AND PAYING OUR DUES AND EVERYTHING. AND IT FELT LIKE THESE GUYS WERE KIND OF NEW OR SOMETHING. AND I --
Jimmy: YOU HAD A GREAT LINE IN THE BOOK.
AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, IT ALMOST SEEMED LIKE THEY GOT GUITARS FOR CHRISTMAS AND SAID, "LET'S START A BAND."
Jimmy: IT'S JUST SO FUN. BUT THAT'S THE WAY EVERY BAND STARTS. WHICH IS GREAT.
THAT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: IT'S THE COOLEST. THE COMPANION CD IS WELL DONE. IT'S HAND-PICKED BY YOU. YOU GOT SONGS FROM YOU SOLO, THE BAND, YOU HAVE BOB DYLAN ON HERE. AND I WILL SAY, LEVON AND THE HAWKS, "HE DON'T LOVE YOU" IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE. QUEST, YOU'RE GOING TO FREAK OUT FOR THIS.
Questlove: I CAN'T WAIT.
Jimmy: IT'S A JAMMER HERE. THEN WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT "THE LAST WALTZ", 40th ANNIVERSARY.
THE 40th ANNIVERSARY OF "THE LAST WALTZ."
Jimmy: THAT CAME FAST.
WHICH I'M IN COMPLETE DENIAL ABOUT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: 40. BUT I MEAN, YOU END UP HAVING THIS GIANT CONCERT, BECAUSE YOU JUST SAID, LIKE, THE BAND'S DONE. WE'RE FINISHED. WE'RE JUST --
WE HAD -- WE WANTED TO BRING IT TO A CONCLUSION. WE HAD BEEN TOGETHER 16 YEARS, AND WE HAD KIND OF DONE EVERYTHING, WE THOUGHT. AND SO IT WAS LIKE, LET'S HAVE A MUSICAL CELEBRATION. AND -- AND WE'LL CLOSE THIS EPISODE AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK WITH A NEW CREATIVE SPIRIT. WE HAD ALL OF THESE IDEAS IN MIND. SO THIS -- IT STARTED AS A VERY MODEST IDEA. WE THOUGHT, WE'LL PLAY A LAST CONCERT WHERE WE PLAYED OUR FIRST CONCERT AS THE BAND, AND WE'LL INVITE RONNIE HAWKINS -- THAT WE STARTED OUT WITH -- AND BOB DYLAN. THAT WOULD BE THE RESPECTFUL THING TO DO.
Jimmy: COOL.
AND THEN SOMEONE SAID, "I KNOW, BUT WE CAN'T DO THIS AND NOT INVITE ERIC CLAPTON. I MEAN THAT'S JUST WRONG."
Jimmy: I MEAN, HELLO.
HE'S BEEN WAVING THE FLAG SINCE THE BEGINNING.
Jimmy: INVITE ERIC CLAPTON TO EVERYTHING.
AND THEN I SAID, "OH, GEEZ, IF WE INVITE ERIC, THEN WE GOT TO INVITE VAN MORRISON, RIGHT?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH AND YOU GOT VAN MORRISON AND YOU GOT TO INVITE NEIL YOUNG. IF YOU GOT NEIL YOUNG --
YOU GOT TO GET THE CANADIANS IN THERE. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. CANADA IN THE HOUSE. YEAH 'CAUSE -- I SAW THE FLEUR-DE-LIS.
YEAH. OH, YEAH. WE THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT CANADA HERE PRETTY SOON. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. GOOD INVESTMENT THERE. THIS COMPANION BOOK IS A A RARE -- I DON'T KNOW WHO PUT THIS ONE TOGETHER TOO. BUT THIS IS FOR "THE LAST WALTZ" AND IT'S GOT LIKE SCRIPT NOTES, BECAUSE SCORSESE ENDED UP DIRECTING THIS FILM. I DON'T KNOW -- CAN YOU SEE IT?
WHAT HAPPENED WAS AFTER WE DID "THE LAST WALTZ" -- AND FOR MARTIN SCORCESE IT WASN'T LIKE OH, WE'LL GET A BUNCH OF GUYS WITH CAMERAS AND WE'LL SHOOT. AND WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN -- HE WANTED TO MAKE A MOVIE. HE WANTED THIS FILM AND IT WAS THE FIRST ONE EVER SHOT IN 35 MILLIMETER LIKE THIS.
Jimmy: AND HOW COOL IS MARTIN?
SO AFTER HE DID IT, AS A A GIFT, HE PUT HIS WHOLE SCRIPT AND HIS STORY BOARDS AND ALL THE THINGS TOGETHER IN THIS AND GAVE IT TO ME AS A GIFT. AND SO MY COPY OF THIS HAS BEEN LIVING AT THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME MUSEUM, AND THEY JUST RECENTLY SAID, "DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE OKAY WITH MARTY IF WE MADE THESE AGAIN? AND THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY SHARE IT WITH SOME PEOPLE?" MARTY SAID, "GREAT." AND SO THEY'VE DONE IT. AND LOOK AT IT.
Jimmy: I KNOW. IT'S A BEAST. IT'S REAL.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S -- YEAH.
IT'S KIND OF HARD FOR YOU TO NOT HURT YOUR BACK WITH IT.
Jimmy: YEAH. DISLOCATE IT.
IT'S AMAZING. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
Jimmy: IT'S FANTASTIC AND I JUST. PLEASE GET THIS BOOK IF YOU LOVE ROCK AND ROLL, IF YOU LOVE MUSIC. "TESTIMONY", CHECK THIS THING OUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ROBBIE ROBERTSON. AND THE COMPANION ALBUM IS IN STORES NOW. WE'LL BE BACK WITH A A PERFORMANCE FROM AMINE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
