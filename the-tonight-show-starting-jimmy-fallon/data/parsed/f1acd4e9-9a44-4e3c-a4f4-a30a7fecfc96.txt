DAISY RIDLEY FROM THE NEW "STAR WARS" MOVIE IS HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT HER ROLE. IN THE MOVIE, SHE PLAYS A A CHARACTER WHO TRIES TO SALVAGE MASSIVE WRECKAGES, WHICH EXPLAINS WHY HE'S BEEN HIRED BY JEB BUSH'S CAMPAIGN. INTERESTING COINCIDENCE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GOING TOO GREAT FOR JEB BUSH, BUT HE'S NOT GIVING UP. IN FACT, I READ THAT HIS CAMPAIGN HAS SPENT THE MOST MONEY ON TV ADS AT $30 MILLION. I DON'T WANT TO SAY JEB'S RUN TOO MANY ADS, BUT HIS NEW SECRET SERVICE CODE NAME IS GEICO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE GOOD ADS.
Steve: YEAH, THEY'RE GREAT.
Jimmy: OVER ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, HILLARY CLINTON RECENTLY STARTED FOLLOWING A BUNCH OF NEW PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS ON INSTAGRAM, INCLUDING THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CHANNEL, HGTV. WHEN ASKED WHY, HILLARY WAS LIKE, "OH, I'M GETTING A NEW HOUSE SOON." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "GRANITE COUNTERTOPS, OUTDOOR SPACE." ACTUALLY, HILLARY WENT ON KIND OF AN INSTAGRAM BINGE AND FOLLOWED A BUNCH OF CELEBRITIES LIKE BEYONCE, KATY PERRY AND LADY GAGA.
