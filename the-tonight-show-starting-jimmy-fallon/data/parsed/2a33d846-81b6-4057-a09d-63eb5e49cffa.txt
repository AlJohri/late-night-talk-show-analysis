Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! HI, WELCOME! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
Audience: JIMMY! JIMMY!
Jimmy: OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PLEASE, WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY, THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, IT'S THE BIG SEASON FINALE OF "THE BACHELORETTE." [ SCREAMS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, THE FINAL ROSE HAS BEEN ACCEPTED, AND NOW THE HAPPY COUPLE GOES OFF INTO THE SUNSET, AND A HAZMAT TEAM MOVES IN TO CLEAN UP THE HOT TUB. AND THAT -- [ LAUGHTER ] HAPPENS EVERY YEAR. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: LOT OF BLEACH.
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, BEFORE SHE GAVE OUT THE FINAL ROSE, JOJO SAID SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH BOTH JORDAN AND ROBBY. AND SHE WAS GOING BACK ON FORTH ON WHO TO PICK. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] OR AS AMERICANS PUT IT, "HEY, JUST BE HAPPY YOU HAVE TWO CANDIDATES WORTH PICKING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT JOJO'S FAMILY DID GET TO SHARE THEIR OPINIONS, YOU KNOW, THEY NEED THE FAMILY TO TALK. THEY ASK FOR ADVICE. HER FAMILY SHARED THEIR OPINIONS ON WHETHER JOJO SHOULD PICK JORDAN OR ROBBY, AND EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE. CHECK THIS OUT.
I THINK ROBBY IS MORE HUSBAND MATERIAL FOR YOU, BABY.
HE WOULD BE A MORE LOGICAL FIT FOR YOU.
ALL OF US FELT LIKE ROBBY WAS READY FOR A SERIOUS LIFE OF MARRIAGE.
CERTAINLY SEE THAT ROBBY'S COMMITTED.
Jimmy: SO, I GUESS THAT MADE THINGS PRETTY EASY. ♪♪
JORDAN, WILL YOU ACCEPT THIS ROSE?
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. [ APPLAUSE ] WHY EVEN ASK THEM?
Steve: WHY? YEAH.
Jimmy: ALTHOUGH, LET'S BE HONEST. IF SHE TOOK HER FAMILY'S ADVICE, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE ON "THE BACHELORETTE" IN THE FIRST PLACE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: NO!
Jimmy: BUT THE FINALE WAS A A HUGE THREE-HOUR EVENT, AND JUST IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, HERE'S A QUICK RECAP. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ AND IT'S NO SECRET THAT THEY'VE HAD SOME TROUBLES DOWN THERE GETTING READY, BUT THE MAYOR OF RIO JUST GAVE A STATEMENT SAYING THE CITY HAS GOTTEN IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE LEADING UP TO THE GAMES. WHEN ASKED WHAT CAUSED HIM TO BE SO OPTIMISTIC, THE MAYOR SAID, "COCAINE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S FREE HERE. VERY AVAILABLE. BUT GET THIS, DOCTORS ARE TELLING THE RIO ATHLETES COMPETING IN WATER SPORTS NOT TO PUT THEIR HEADS UNDER WATER. [ LAUGHTER ] TO AVOID GETTING SICK. SO REMEMBER, IF YOU'RE SWIMMING AT THE OLYMPICS, SWIM ABOVE THE WATER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DON'T SWIM IN THE WATER. THAT'S RIGHT, DOCTORS ARE TELLING SWIMMERS NOT TO PUT THEIR HEADS UNDER WATER. ATHLETES ASKED HOW THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SWIM WITH THEIR HEADS IN THE AIR, AND DOCTORS WERE LIKE, "OH, NO, DON'T -- YOU DON'T BREATHE IN THE AIR. THAT'S EVEN WORSE." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WORSE THAN THE WATER. [ APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, THE ELECTION IS STILL GOING ON, AND DONALD TRUMP HAD YET ANOTHER AWKWARD MOMENT TODAY. APPARENTLY THERE WAS A CRYING BABY AT ONE OF HIS RALLIES, AND TRUMP ACTUALLY KICKED IT OUT, SAYING, "GET THE BABY OUT OF HERE."

[ APPLAUSE ] AND HILLARY CLINTON SAID THIS WEEKEND THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE AT ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, DESPITE TRUMP PROTESTING THE SCHEDULE. HILLARY SAID THAT EVEN IF TRUMP DOESN'T SHOW, SHE'S CHANGED HER POSITIONS ENOUGH THAT SHE CAN JUST DEBATE HERSELF. [ APPLAUSE ] SEE? IT WORKS OUT.
Steve: ALL GOOD.
Jimmy: IT WORKS OUT. SPEAKING OF HILLARY, IT'S REPORTED THAT SHE'S BEEN ASKING "VOGUE" EDITOR-IN-CHIEF ANNA WINTOUR FOR FASHION ADVICE DURING THE CAMPAIGN, AND WHEN ANNA ISN'T AVAILABLE, HILLARY TURNS TO HER NEXT CHOICE, KIM JONG-UN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: "THE GET DOWN."
YES.
Jimmy: ON NETFLIX.
YES.
Jimmy: BAZ LUHRMANN.
BAZ, BAZ, "THE GET DOWN." 100%.
Jimmy: WHY IS IT CALLED "THE GET DOWN?"
WELL "THE GET DOWN" SEE, IT'S ABOUT 1970s IN THE BRONX, AND "THE GET DOWN" CAN MEAN, YOU KNOW MANY, MANY DIFFERENT THINGS IN 1970s IN THE BRONX. LIKE, YO, WE ABOUT TO GET DOWN, LIKE, WE ABOUT TO GET WITH A A GIRL, WE ABOUT TO GET DOWN WE ABOUT TO FIGHT OR WE ABOUT TO GET DOWN LIKE THE BLOCK PARTIES THAT THEY USED HAVE, WITH GRANDMASTER FLASH WITH EXTENDING THE BEAT, AND WHEN THE MCs WOULD GO ON AND JUST LIKE, SHUT IT DOWN. "THE GET DOWN" IS THE PARTY SEQUENCE. "THE GET DOWN" IS THE MUSIC, AND THE ART, AND THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE OF THE BRONX IN THAT TIME.
Jimmy: "THE GET DOWN" WAS "THE GET DOWN." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THERE IT IS. THERE I AM.
Jimmy: LOOKING GOOD, AND GRANDMASTER FLASH IS HE PRODUCING? DOES HE HAVE SOMEBODY DO IT?
YES, GRANDMASTER FLASH EXECUTIVE PRODUCING, AND NAS EXECUTIVE PRODUCING.
Jimmy: NAS?
NAS! [ CHEERS ] I'M SO HAPPY TO BE A PART OF IT, AND YOU KNOW, JUST BE, YOU KNOW, THE HISTORY OF IT IS WHAT MADE ME REALLY WANT TO BE A A PART OF IT. YOU KNOW, JUST, LIKE, HIP HOP IS SUCH INFLUENCING OF POPULAR CULTURE RIGHT NOW, THAT IT'S SO AMAZING TO GO BACK AND REALLY LOOK AND SEE, WHERE DID THIS START? WHAT WAS THE ORIGINS OF THIS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? IS THAT THE MECCA OF HIP HOP WAS 1970s IN THE BRONX, THAT'S WHERE IT STARTED. YOU KNOW, DISCO DYING OUT, AND HIP HOP COMING IN TO TAKE THE THRONE OF THE BRONX WHILE EVERYTHING IS CRUMBLING. THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE SHOW IS ABOUT. AND I'M JUST SO HAPPY TO BE A A PART OF IT.
Jimmy: WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM GRANDMASTER FLASH? DID HE GIVE YOU ANYTHING, LIKE, OH, HERE'S THE WAY YOU DO IT. OR HERE'S WHAT?
I MEAN, GRANDMASTER FLASH YOU KNOW, WAS TEACHING SHAMEIK WHOSE ACTUALLY PLAYING A A CHARACTER CALLED SHAOLIN FANTASTIC, SHOUTOUT TO SHAMEIK. HE TAUGHT SHAMEIK HOW TO EXTEND THE BEAT AND EXTEND THE BREAK, WHICH IS WHAT HE DOING WHEN HE HAS THE TWO RECORDS TOGETHER. HE'S MAKING LIKE DISCO RECORDS AND HE FINDS THE DRUM PART, WHERE THE BEAT KICKS IN, WHERE YOU CAN RAP OVER, WHERE YOU CAN BREAK DANCE, AND HE PLAYED THE SAME SONG ON TWO DIFFERENT RECORDS AND HE JUST EXTENDS THE BREAKS. SO HE'LL PLAY THE BREAK HERE, ONCE THE BREAK OVER, ONCE THE BREAKS OVER, HE'LL SWITCH AND HE'LL PLAY THE BREAK ON THE OTHER DISK, ON THE OTHER RECORD, AND THEN HE EXTENDS THE BREAK SO IT JUST KEEPS GOING SEEMLESSLY. AND LOOPING AND LOOPING AND LOOPING, AND THAT'S WHAT BEING A TRUE DJ IS, AND THAT'S WHAT HE TAUGHT SHAMEIK, AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT THE BASIS OF THE SHOW IS ABOUT, HOW EXTENDING THE BREAK EVENTUALLY EVOLVED INTO BECOMING AN MC AND RAPPING OVER THE BREAK, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, LEADING TO DRAKE AND EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE NOW.
Jimmy: AND THE ROOTS, ABSOLUTELY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. I TRIED TO DO THAT. I CAN'T. QUIK LOVE IS AN AMAZING DJ.
SHOUTOUT TO THE ROOTS. LOVE YOU GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I KNOW YOU LOVE THEM. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN QUEST DJ?
I HAVE.
Jimmy: HE'S A FANTASTIC DJ.
HE'S SO GOOD.
Jimmy: HE'S SO GOOD. BUT, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT. IT'S LIKE, I CAN'T EVEN PLAY ONE RECORD. I PUT ONE ON, AND I HAD PEOPLE LIKE, BOO, TURN IT OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, WHAT YOU GUYS AREN'T INTO THIS? BUT JUST BACK AND FORTH AND CROSSFADE, OH, IT'S TOO MUCH.
IT'S TOTALLY COMPLICATED. THAT'S WHY MY CHARACTER DOES THE GRAFITTI, AND HE'S NOT THE DJ. YOU KNOW, SHAMEIK THAT'S A DJ. MY CHARACTER JUST DOES ALL OF THE GRAFFITI, LIKE, THAT'S WHY HE HAS PAINT ON LIKE HIS PANTS AND STUFF.
Jimmy: YEAH.
HE'S JUST ALL ABOUT TAGGING, AND LIKE THAT'S HIS ART FORM AND THAT'S HOW HE, LIKE, GETS RECOGNIZED BY THE WORLD.
Jimmy: I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S JADEN SMITH IN "THE GET DOWN."
YOU CAN PAINT SPOTLIGHTS, AND BAT SIGNALS. YOU CAN PAINT CONSTELLATIONS, BREAD CRUMB TRAILS, SUPPOSED TO TELL A STORY. SHOT 007, MAN. HIS PUMA'S ARE ALWAYS PRISTINE. HIS HANDS ARE SAMURAI SWORDS.
HAVE YOU SEEN SHAO'S LATEST?
