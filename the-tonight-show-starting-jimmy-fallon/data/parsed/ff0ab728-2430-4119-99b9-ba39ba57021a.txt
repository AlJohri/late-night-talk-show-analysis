HE'S A FREAK OF NATURE. HE'S ALREADY -- NO, HE IS. HE'S LIKE, COMPLETELY FULLY FORMED. HE'S NOW 13, HE WAS ABOUT 11 WHEN WE MADE THE FILM, AND EVERY DAY WAS A JOY. BECAUSE THE KID IS UNBELIEVABLY GOOD.
Jimmy: REALLY. 13 AND HOW MANY STEPS DOES HE DO A DAY? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A CLIP, HERE'S CLIVE OWEN IN "THE CONFIRMATION." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. ♪♪

Jimmy: THAT IS A WHITE WEDDING. HI, YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
HI!
Jimmy: WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jimmy: I WANT YOU, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.
OKAY.
Jimmy: I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS. BUT I WANT YOU TO TELL THE RUE McCLANAHAN STORY.
OH, MY GOSH.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
OKAY, SURE.
Jimmy: YEAH. THIS WAS WHEN YOU WERE DOING -- THERE WAS A ONE PERSON, ONE-WOMAN SHOW.
I HAD WRITTEN AN SCREENPLAY TO "MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING", AND I COULDN'T GET IT READ, BECAUSE MY AGENT DROPPED ME. SHE TOLD ME I WASN'T PRETTY ENOUGH TO BE A LEADING LADY. YEAH! AND NOT FAT ENOUGH TO BE A CHARACTER ACTRESS. LIKE SHE DIDN'T SAY, YOU'RE NOT FAT, LIKE A CHARACTER -- SHE SAID YOU'RE NOT FAT ENOUGH. THANK YOU! THANK YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY JUST MADE --
SO I JUMPED UP ON STAGE AND DID THE MATERIAL AS A ONE-PERSON SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND JOHN RATZENBERGER FROM "CHEERS" CAME. RIGHT? AND RUE McCLANAHAN CAME. AND I WAS SO EXCITED SHE WAS IN THE AUDIENCE.
Jimmy: THERE WAS A GOLDEN GIRL IN THE AUDIENCE.
TOTALLY. SO COOL. SO HER ASSISTANT CAME UP TO ME AFTER THE SHOW AND SHE SAID, "RUE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU OVER FOR DINNER." AND I WAS LIKE, OKAY. SHE SAID "CAN I HAVE YOUR NUMBER?" AND I WAS LIKE "IT'S ON THE POSTER. THAT'S THE NUMBER YOU CALLED IF YOU COME OVER." IT WAS OUR HOME PHONE NUMBER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WOW.
YEAH. BECAUSE I'M NOT COOL. SO, WE'RE DRIVING THERE AND MY HUSBAND IAN IS A NEW YORKER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I'M FROM CANADA. SO, I'M MUCH MORE NAIVE AND UNDERSTAND -- I WAS LIKE, I BELIEVE RUE McCLANAHAN WANTS TO HAVE US OVER. WE'RE DRIVING OVER THERE AND IAN, THE NEW YORKER, IS LIKE "WHY ARE WE GOING THERE?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE "RUE McCLANAHAN SAW MY SHOW AND SHE WANTS TO HAVE US FOR DINNER." SO, THE ASSISTANT HAD CALLED ME AND THEY WANTED TO DO A WHOLE GREEK DINNER. AND SHE HAD ASKED ME FOR ALL THESE INGREDIENTS AND EVERYTHING. SO WE GET THERE, THE ASSISTANT OPENS THE DOOR, I CAN SEE LIKE RUE AND LIKE SUSAN RATTAN AND PEOPLE WERE OUT, ESTELLE GETTY WERE OUT ON THE PATIO HAVING DRINKS AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD. I'M SO EXCITED TO WALK OUT THERE. THE ASSISTANT TAKES MY ARM, TAKES ME TO THE KITCHEN AND THERE'S ALL OF THESE INGREDIENTS SET OUT AND SHE GOES "OKAY, HERE'S THE GREEK INGREDIENTS, START COOKING." [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S MY FAVORITE STORY. IT'S SO FUNNY. WHAT'S YOUR HUSBAND --
MY HUSBAND, I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK AT MY HUSBAND, BECAUSE I COULD FEEL HIS HOT EYES BORING INTO THE SIDE OF MY FACE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE, ALL RIGHT, AND OPENING UP THE PHYLLO PASTRY LIKE, "FIRST YOU BUTTER IT." [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS JUST LIKE "OH, MY GOD."
Jimmy: DO A DEMO.
SO, I MAKE THE DINNER. GO OUT THERE, I MEET THE PEOPLE. THEY COME IN, THEY HAVE DINNER. NOBODY IS TALKING TO US. IT'S JUST AWKWARD AND QUIET. AND WE EAT THE DINNER AND I'M LIKE, THIS IS WEIRD. IAN'S LOOKING. SO I FINALLY THOUGHT, WE SHOULD GO. WE STOOD UP AND WE SAID, "WELL, THANK YOU FOR HAVING US, I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO GO" AND I GUESS RUE McCLANAHAN, I FELT SHE MUST HAVE SENSED SOMETHING WAS ODD. BECAUSE AS WE WALKED TO THE DOOR SHE SAID -- "WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, CAN YOU GIVE ESTELLE GETTY A RIDE HOME?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE BEST PART OF THE STORY. SO, SHE GETS IN THE BACK OF YOUR CAR?
NO, SHE GETS TO THE FRONT SEAT. ESTELLE GETTY IS IN THE FRONT SEAT AND I'M IN THE BACK, JUST LIKE, "OH, MY GOD." AND I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT IAN. AND SHE'S LIKE THIS, "I DON'T GET IT, ARE YOU A CHEF?" SHE'S SAYING TO ME IN THE BACK SEAT. AND I WAS LIKE "NO, ESTELLE GETTY, I'M AN ACTOR AND I HAVE A GREEK SHOW." AND YOU COOK IN IT. SHE SAID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE BEST THING IS YOU GAVE ESTELLE GETTY A RIDE HOME.
THE BEST.
Jimmy: THAT'S MY FAVORITE STORY, EVER. "MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING" IS THE HIGHEST-GROSSING ROMANTIC COMEDY OF ALL TIME. DID YOU KNOW THAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

I GUESS WHEN MY DAUGHTER STARTED TO PULL AWAY, I SHOULD HAVE RETREATED, BUT I STAYED TOO CLOSE. I KEPT VOLUNTEERING AT HER SCHOOL. I WANTED HER TO THINK I WAS COOL AGAIN.
OH!
LOSER.
THEN I REMEMBERED -- I'VE NEVER BEEN COOL.
HERE COMES THE PRINCIPAL.
MY HUSBAND HAS ALWAYS BEEN COOL. HE JUST HAS IT. AND HE ALWAYS KNOWS THE PERFECT THING TO SAY.
YOU OKAY, BABE?
UH-HUH.

Jimmy: JUST COMING IN.
WIND. YEAH.
Jimmy: GOT THE BEYONCE WIND MACHINE.

WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. HELLO, I'M JIMMY CARR, I SHOULD EXPLAIN, I LOOK LIKE THIS BECAUSE MY DAD IS IRISH AND MY MUM IS ROGER FEDERER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] A NURSE FINDS A RECTAL THERMOMETER IN HER POCKET AND THINKS, "SOME [ BLEEP ]HOLE GOT MY PEN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FRIEND OF MINE SAID, "WHAT RHYMES WITH ORANGE?" I SAID, "NO, IT DOESN'T." [ LAUGHTER ] I WENT TO A PROPER SHOWBIZ PARTY RECENTLY AND BRAD PITT WAS THERE. AND THEY SAY NEVER MEET YOUR HEROES, BUT I THINK BRAD HANDLED IT REALLY WELL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FLOODING. FLOODING IS PRETTY BAD. THERE'S BEEN TERRIBLE FLOODING ALL OVER ENGLAND RECENTLY. I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS, I SAW A WOMAN ON THE NEWS IN HER FLOODED KITCHEN, CRYING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK -- CRYING IS NOT HELPING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IF ANYTHING, YOU'RE MAKING MATTERS WORSE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LAST TIME WE HAD A WHITE CHRISTMAS, I MADE SNOW ANGELS. I SKIDDED ON THE ICE AND TOOK OUT THREE PEDESTRIANS. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] THEY'RE JUST JOKES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE. THAT LAST ONE HAPPENED. BUT MOST OF THEM ARE JUST JOKES. [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT TALKING TO A NORTH AFRICAN GIRL IN HER NATIVE LANGUAGE FOR HOURS. WE JUST CLICKED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ANTHROPOLOGY JOKES, EVERYONE. SOME COMICS LIE TO AN AUDIENCE. THEY PRETEND THEY RECENTLY BROKE UP WITH A GIRL, THAT SHE LEFT FOR ANOTHER GUY. IT'S A TOTAL LIE. THE REASON THEY TELL THAT LIE IS TO ELICIT SYMPATHY FROM ATTRACTIVE FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBERS, SO THEN AFTER THE SHOW THEY CAN GET TALKING TO THEM. THEY'VE GOT THE SYMPATHY IN, AND THEY CAN TRY AND PICK THEM UP AND ULTIMATELY TRY AND SLEEP WITH THEM. REST ASSURED, I WOULD NEVER DO THAT, BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD BE DISRESPECTFUL TO THE MEMORY OF MY WIFE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I JUST NEED TO BE HELD. MY GIRLFRIEND AND I RECENTLY HAD A PROPER CONVERSATION ABOUT PORNOGRAPHY. SOME OF YOU MAY SHARE HER SENTIMENT. SHE SAID TO ME, SHE SAID, "I DON'T GET PORN. I'VE NEVER GOT PORN. WHY WOULD I WANT TO WATCH TWO PEOPLE HAVE SEX?" I SAID, "TWO? [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU LOST ME. I'VE BEEN DESCRIBED, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AS A SEX SYMBOL. AND THAT SYMBOL IS A QUESTION MARK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FOLLOWED BY A NO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHEN A MAN CHANGES HIS FACEBOOK STATUS FROM "SINGLE" TO "IN A RELATIONSHIP," I THINK IT SHOULD SAY, "UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T LIKE SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH MY GIRLFRIEND'S FAMILY, BECAUSE HER HUSBAND IS GETTING SUSPICIOUS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I FIND MOST YOUNG WOMEN MAKE A LOT OF NOISE IN THE BEDROOM. I GUESS THEY'RE NOT EXPECTING TO SEE ANYONE AT THEIR WINDOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS IN BED WITH A GIRL RECENTLY, AND SHE SAID TO ME, SHE SAID, "I WANT TONIGHT TO BE MAGICAL." AND IT WAS. AFTER WE HAD SEX, I DISAPPEARED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR EVERYONE IN HERE. WHO HERE HAS HAD BAD SEX? WHO'S NOT SAYING IT BECAUSE THEY'RE WITH THE PERSON THEY HAD THE BAD SEX WITH? [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN GET, GENTLEMEN, IF YOU HAVE OR YOU PERCEIVE THAT YOU HAVE A SMALL PENIS. IT'S CALLED AN AUDI CONVERTIBLE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HAVE YOU GOT AN AUDI CONVERTIBLE THERE, SIR? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HAVE YOU? YOU HAVEN'T? SHE JUST GAVE YOU A LOOK LIKE SOMETHING IN THE JOKE RELATED TO YOU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND YOU'RE SAYING IT DEFINITELY WASN'T THE CAR. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MY JOKES OCCASIONALLY GET ME INTO TROUBLE. I GOT STOPPED SPEEDING RECENTLY AND THE OFFICER CAME TO THE WINDOW OF MY CAR, AS THEY DO, AND HE SAID, " DO YOU KNOW HOW FAST YOU WERE GOING?" AND I SAID, "I'M SORRY, IT WAS CLEARLY TOO FAST, MY APOLOGIES." HE SAID, "88 MILES AN HOUR." I SAID, "I WAS TRYING TO GET BACK TO 1955." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THE MOST COMMON SUPERSTITION IN THE WORLD TODAY IS THE BELIEF IN HOROSCOPES. AND THERE'S A NAME FOR PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE IN HOROSCOPES. THEY'RE CALLED SINGLE WOMEN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] WELL THAT'S ALL I GOT TIME FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED. CHEERS, GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
