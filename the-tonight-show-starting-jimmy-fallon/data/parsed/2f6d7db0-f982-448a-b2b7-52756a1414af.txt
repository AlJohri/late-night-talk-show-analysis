Jimmy: FANTASTIC. HEY! HOT CROWD. HOT CROWD. GETTING READY FOR A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT, RIGHT? WE GOT A BIG ONE TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE, YOU GUYS. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IT IT. THIS IS YOU. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE THE SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE WHOLE THING. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. TOMORROW IS THE FIFTH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. AND IF YOU HAVE BEEN KEEPING SCORE SO FAR, THE WINNER OF MOST OF THE REPUBLICAN DEBATES HAS BEEN HILLARY CLINTON. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOW, TOMORROW'S DEBATE IS IN LAS VEGAS. AND OF COURSE, ALL THE CANDIDATES WILL BE THERE EARLY. WE ACTUALLY FOUND OUT HOW THEY'LL BE SPENDING THE DAY IN VEGAS BEFORE THE DEBATE BEGINS. FOR INSTANCE, JEB BUSH WILL ASK DAVID COPPERFIELD TO MAKE HIM DISAPPEAR, WHICH IS NICE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S NICE IF HE CAN DO IT.
Steve: IF HE CAN DO IT. HE'LL TRY.
Jimmy: NEXT, BEN CARSON WILL GO TO A MAGIC SHOW, BUT GET THROWN OUT WHEN HE ENDS UP HYPNOTIZING THE MAGICIAN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. AND FINALLY, CHRIS CHRISTIE WILL GO TO THE 24 HOUR BUFFET AND SAY, "I LIVE HERE NOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S GOING TO DO THAT. HE'S MOVING THERE. I LIVE THERE.
Steve: HE'S JUST MOVING TO THE BUFFET? HE LIVES THERE NOW.
Jimmy: THAT'S HIS ADDRESS, YEAH.
Steve: THAT SEEMS CRAZY.
Jimmy: OVER ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN RESPONDING TO DONALD TRUMP'S COMMENTS ABOUT BANNING MUSLIMS WITH A MESSAGE OF LOVE. SHE SAID THAT SHE WANTS TO WEED OUT HATE AND PLANT LOVE AND KINDNESS INSTEAD. THEN BILL WENT IN FOR A KISS AND HILLARY WAS LIKE, "NOT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] PRESS RELEASE. I'M TALKING TO THE PEOPLE." THIS IS PRETTY BIG. DURING THE PARIS CLIMATE TALKS OVER THE WEEKEND, LEADERS FROM 195 COUNTRIES REACHED AN AGREEMENT THAT CALLS FOR COUNTRIES TO TRY AND KEEP THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PLANET FROM RISING MORE THAN TWO DEGREES. OR IN OTHER WORDS, THEY HAVE THE SAME ATTITUDE ABOUT THE EARTH'S TEMPERATURE THAT YOUR DAD HAS ABOUT THE THERMOSTAT. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, WHO TURNED THIS UP? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] 61 DEGREES.
Steve: THAT'S IT.
Jimmy: WEAR A SWEATER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: I GOT A SPACE HEATER BY ME.
Jimmy: I CAN SEE MY BREATH. I DON'T CARE. I SAW THAT LAST WEEK, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT HIS FAVORITE MOVIE THIS YEAR WAS "THE MARTIAN." [ CHEERS ] THAT'S RIGHT. AFTER SEEING THE FILM ABOUT A A MAN STRANDED ALONE ON A A DISTANT PLANET, OBAMA SAID, "PUT ME IN THE SEQUEL." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "BUT DON'T BRING ME HOME. DON'T BRING ME HOME. I DON'T WANT TO COME HOME." [ LAUGHTER ] "DON'T BRING ME HOME. PUT ME IN THE SEQUEL." [ LAUGHTER ] "DON'T BRING ME HOME. PUT ME IN THE SEQUEL. DON'T BRING ME HOME.

YEAH, NASA SAID IT'S THE BEST WAY TO REMIND THE ASTRONAUTS THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN SPACE REALLY ISN'T THAT COOL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GUYS SHOOT LASERS?
Steve: NO.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE LASER SWORD FIGHTS?
Steve: NO.
Jimmy: JUST KIND OF WATCH THE PLANETS GROW, REALLY. THIS IS KIND OF COOL. I HEARD THERE'S GOING TO BE A A FULL MOON ON CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1977. AS OPPOSED TO THAT OTHER FULL MOON ON CHRISTMAS WHEN YOUR DAD BENDS OVER TO WATER THE TREE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE GOES, "I'M KIND OF FEELING DRAFTY. MAYBE WE SHOULD TURN THE THERMOSTAT UP. WHO TOUCHED THIS THING? 63 DEGREES IS TOO HOT. TAKE YOUR SWEATER OFF IF YOU'RE HOT!"
Steve: TAKE IT OFF!"
Jimmy: DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? A DAD IN CANADA HAS BEEN GETTING ON THE ELF ON THE SHELF TREND BY DRESSING HIMSELF UP AS THE ELF AND HIDING AROUND HIS HOUSE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THE KIDS ACTUALLY MIGHT GET TO SEE SANTA THIS YEAR BECAUSE THEY ARE NEVER SLEEPING AGAIN. IT'S LIKE, "OH, GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON TOP OF THE FRIDGE? GET OUT OF HERE."
Steve: DAD.
Jimmy: PEOPLE AREN'T REALLY SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS, BUT A DEPARTMENT STORE IN THE U.K. CALLED ROBERT DYAS RELEASED AN AD FOR THE HOLIDAYS THIS WEEK. ANYONE SEEN THIS? THIS IS A REAL COMMERCIAL IN THE U.K. IT'S GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE CONFUSED. CHECK IT OUT.

Steve: SAY HELLO TO A GOOD BUY.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. GET THIS, EVERYBODY. I SAW THAT U.P.S. IS STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH THE HIGH DEMAND DURING THE HOLIDAYS THIS YEAR. IT'S BAD NEWS FOR PEOPLE WHO MAIL THEIR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. GREAT NEWS FOR PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T BUT STILL WANT TO LIE ABOUT IT. OH, U.P.S. IS HAVING TROUBLE. I GUESS MY GIFT DIDN'T GET HERE IN TIME. IT WAS A BIG BOX, TOO. WHAT DID YOU WANT AGAIN? OH, YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. [ LAUGHTER ] SORRY.

Jimmy: YOU LOOK GOOD. EVERY TIME YOU LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT. YOU HAVE DARK HAIR NOW. BLACK HAIR.
YEAH. I HAD A BIG SALON DAY THE OTHER DAY BECAUSE I'M SHOOTING A A MOVIE IN PARIS NEXT YEAR CALLED "VALERIAN." LUC BESSON'S DIRECTING IT. IT'S LIKE THE MOVIE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO DIRECT.
Jimmy: "VALERIAN."
YEAH. IT'S BASED OFF A '70s COMIC BOOK ABOUT A GUY CALLED VALERIAN. I PLAY VALERIAN, AND VALERIAN HAS DARK HAIR.
Jimmy: WOW. SO THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE DARK HAIR.
YEAH, THE DARK HAIR.
Jimmy: SAY HI TO LUC BESSON FOR ME BECAUSE I LOVE LUC BESSON. HE'S A GENIUS, I LOVE THAT GUY. I HEARD HE'S GOT LIKE A A DRIVEWAY IN HIS HOUSE WHERE HE LIVES, WHERE DOES HE LIVE? EUROPE?
HE'S GOT A DRIVEWAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: I HEARD HE'S GOT A A GREAT DRIVEWAY.
I WAS ONLY AT HIS PLACE IN L.A., BUT IT'S A PRETTY NICE DRIVEWAY.

NICE, REALLY.
Jimmy: AND LIKE RACES -- HE DRIVES HOME -- WHEN HE LEAVES HIS DRIVEWAY, HE HAS TO BE GOING LIKE 300 MILES AN HOUR.
NO WAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT, YOU GOTTA SAY, "WHAT'S UP." I GOTTA TO SAY THIS JAMES DEAN MOVIE, I'M SO GLAD YOU MADE THIS. YOU COME ON THE SHOW A COUPLE TIMES. EVERY TIME I SEE YOU, I GO, "YOU LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE." AND I'M TRYING TO THINK OF WHO YOU LOOK LIKE TO ME. AND I TRY TO SAY THIS TO YOU IN THE BEST WAY. WHOEVER IT IS YOU LOOK LIKE, YOU LOOK LIKE DANE DeHAAN, BUT YOU ALSO LOOK LIKE OTHER PEOPLE.
A LOT OF TIMES I GET A YOUNG DiCAPRIO. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: I CAN SEE THAT.
AND A YOUNG BOWIE, DAVID BOWIE.
Jimmy: YEAH. I COULD SEE THAT. VERY BOWIE-ESQUE TONIGHT, I THINK, A LITTLE BIT.
YEAH, I GOT SOME STAR DUST ON MY SHIRT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. BOTH OF THOSE GUYS, YEAH. HOW OLD ARE YOU? DO YOU MIND ME ASKING?
I'M 29. SO I TURN 30 IN FEBRUARY.
Jimmy: YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE 15. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHY I ASKED.
ABSOLUTELY. NO, IT BECOMES A PROBLEM. I GET CARDED PRETTY MUCH EVERY TIME I GO OUT. I HAD DINNER AT THIS PLACE THE OTHER NIGHT. YOU HAD TO BE 21 TO HAVE DINNER THERE. THE GUY, THEY DON'T EVEN ASK YOU FOR YOUR I.D. WHEN THEY THINK YOU'RE TOO YOUNG, THEY SAY, "HOW OLD ARE YOU?" AND THEN YOU GIVE THEM YOUR I.D., AND THEN I WENT IN, AND THEN I ORDERED A GLASS OF WINE, AND THEY GAVE ME THE WINE, BUT THEN THEY CAME RUSHING TO MY TABLE TO MAKE SURE I WAS 21. BUT I HAVE A WAY OF HAVING A A LITTLE BIT OF FUN WITH THEM BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT REOCCURS CONSTANTLY IN MY LIFE.
Jimmy: A GOOD IDEA. HAVE YOU ALWAYS DONE THIS?
I'VE DONE THIS WITH MY LAST TWO DRIVER'S LICENSES. I TRY TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN WITH THE FACE THAT I MAKE.
Jimmy: YOU MAKE THIS FACE. THEN WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE I.D., THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR FACE AND MAKE SURE YOUR FACE MATCHES THE DRIVER'S LICENSE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: LET ME JUST SHOW YOU THE DRIVER'S LICENSE. HERE'S DANE'S DRIVER'S LICENSE. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE DMV IS SO BORING, ANYWAY, RIGHT? YOU'RE WAITING IN LINE FOR TWO HOURS. AND THEN YOU DO --
Jimmy: SO HOW DO YOU GET AWAY WITH THAT? DO THEY KNOW YOU'RE JOKING?
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SMILE THAT'S JUST AWKWARD ENOUGH THAT IT COULD ACTUALLY BE YOUR REAL SMILE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT ANYONE'S REAL SMILE.
MAYBE, THOUGH. IF YOU DO IT, LIKE, JUST SPONTANEOUSLY.
Jimmy: I LIKE THAT.
LIKE ONE, TWO, THREE. THEN THEY SNAP THE PICTURE AND THEN THEY GET THE LOOK ON THEIR FACE LIKE, "IS THAT HIS REAL SMILE?" THEY'RE LIKE, OKAY, "WE'LL DO IT AGAIN." THEY MAKE YOU DO IT THREE TIMES. AFTER THE THIRD TIME, IF YOU'RE JUST CONSISTENT WITH THE AWKWARD SMILE, THEY USUALLY LET YOU GET AWAY WITH IT.
Jimmy: IT BECOMES YOUR SMILE, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO THE GUY COMES OVER, HE HAS YOUR WINE, AND HE GOES -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] PERFECT, YEAH. HE GIVES IT TO YOU. I'M GOING TO DO THAT NEXT TIME. I'M GOTTA WORK ON THIS. I THOUGHT IN MY HEAD THAT YOU LOOKED LIKE JAMES DEAN TO ME THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE.
FOR REAL?
Jimmy: YEAH. AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU. BUT, THEN YOU WENT AND MADE THE MOVIE. IT KIND OF TOOK MY IDEA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT THE ONE THING THAT I SAW IS THAT YOU SAID THE TRICKY THING IS THEY ADDED EARLOBES TO YOU.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: DETACHED EARLOBES.
THAT'S RIGHT. I HAVE CONNECTED EARLOBES WHICH 10% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION HAS CONNECTED EARLOBES. YOU HAVE LIKE DANGLING EARLOBES. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS A GREAT THING. IT'S GREAT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT JAMES DEAN ALSO HAD EARLOBES A LOT LIKE YOUR EARLOBES.
Jimmy: I GET COMPARED TO JAMES DEAN A LOT, YEAH. MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE EARLOBES. YEAH EXACTLY. RIGHT, WE'RE TWINS.
SO --
Jimmy: OH, I NEVER NOTICED.
THEY'RE CONNECTED. SO I WANTED TO LOOK MORE LIKE HIM. I WAS LOOKING AT HIS PROFILE AND I WAS THINKING, "HOW COULD I DO THAT?" AND I HAD THIS IDEA OF MAKING FAKE EARLOBES THAT MY AMAZING MAKEUP ARTIST SARAH RUBANO HAD MADE. AND THEN EVERY DAY, SHE WOULD APPLY FAKE EARLOBES TO MY EARS TO GIVE ME ACTUAL LOBES.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE. WE HAVE THE FAKE EARLOBES. LOOK AT THIS.
YEAH, SO THIS IS THE EARLOBE BEFORE THERE'S MAKEUP ON IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, BEING ATTACHED TO THERE. I HAVE ONE OF YOU HERE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE, SHOWING THAT THEY'RE FAKE.
THAT WAS THE LAST DAY OF WORK AND I WAS SO SICK OF THEM, I TRIED TO RIP THEM OFF. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT IT TURNS OUT TO BE FANTASTIC. BASICALLY WHAT THIS IS, IS JAMES DEAN BEFORE HE WAS THE SUPERSTAR THAT WE KNOW, THE ICON JAMES DEAN.
YES, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: HE IS DOING A PHOTO SHOOT.
IT'S TWO WEEKS OF JAMES DEAN'S LIFE RIGHT BEFORE HIS FIRST MOVIE "EAST OF EDEN" COMES OUT. AND THIS PHOTOGRAPHER DENNIS STOCK, WHO IS PLAYED BY ROBERT PATTINSON, GETS PERMISSION TO DO THE FIRST EVER PHOTO ESSAY ON JAMES DEAN. THEY GO BACK TO NEW YORK AND THEN TO HIS HOMETOWN OF INDIANA, AND THEY TAKE PHOTOS. IT'S WHERE PHOTOS OF HIM IN TIMES SQUARE CAME FROM HIM AND A LOT OF THE MOST ICONIC IMAGES OF HIM COME FROM, THESE TWO WEEKS THAT THESE GUYS SPENT TOGETHER GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER AND TAKING PHOTOS.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. HERE'S AMAZING DANE DeHAAN AS JAMES DEAN IN "LIFE." LOOK AT THIS.
