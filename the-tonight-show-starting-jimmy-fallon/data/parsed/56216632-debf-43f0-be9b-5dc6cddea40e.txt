IN L.A., RIGHT, OKAY. WELL, ACTUALLY, GAVIN COOKS REALLY GOOD, IF YOU WANT TO COME OVER. BUT, ACTUALLY, HE JUST LEFT ON TOUR, SO NO.
Jimmy: HE'S ON TOUR?
YEAH. HE JUST LEFT TODAY. POQUITO MAS IS A GOOD ONE. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: POQUITO MAS. ALL RIGHT, GOOD, I LOVE THAT. ARE YOU STILL PLAYING WITH NO DOUBT OR ARE YOU DOING SOLO STUFF? WHAT'S GOING ON?
WE'RE DOING BOTH.
Jimmy: HOW IS EVERYBODY? I LOVE NO DOUBT.
THEY'RE AWESOME.
Jimmy: THEY CAME ON OUR SHOW AND JUST PLAYED LIKE NINE SONGS.
WE FILLED THE ROOM UP.
Jimmy: EVERYONE WAS GOING NUTS. THE ROOM ACTUALLY BLEW UP. IT EXPLODED.
IT ACTUALLY EXPLODED.
Jimmy: WE HAD TO BUILD A NEW ROOM. WE HAD TO BUILD A NEW ROOM AFTER YOU GUYS CAME. BUT, GOD, YOU GUYS ARE SO GOOD. MAN, I LOVE YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: SO YOU'RE DOING BOTH.
I'M DOING BOTH. MY LIFE IS, LIKE, FULL OF JUST ENDLESS SURPRISES LATELY. FIRST, I GOT PREGNANT, WHICH WAS TOTALLY SHOCKING.
Jimmy: WHAT A BEAUTIFUL, LITTLE BABY. OH, MY GOD.
HE'S HERE. HE'S SO AWESOME.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE CUTEST BABY I'VE EVER SEEN. OH, MY GOSH. THEY COULD MAKE DOLLS BASED ON YOUR BABY. IT'S THAT CUTE OF A BABY.
HE'S AWESOME. AND THEN, I GOT ON "THE VOICE," WHICH WAS TOTALLY AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE. I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?"
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE GREAT. YOU'RE SO GREAT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: BUT, YOU DO COOL, FUN STUFF. AND YOU'RE PHYSICAL. AND YOU'RE STANDING ON CHAIRS AND, LIKE, PEOPLE LOVE YOU. THEY WANT TO HEAR YOUR ADVICE.
IT WAS JUST AMAZING TO BE ON THE SHOW AND BE AROUND ALL THAT MUSIC.
Jimmy: WHAT ABOUT THE MASTERCARD THING THAT YOU'RE DOING, TOO?
I KNOW. BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW @MASTERCARD TO BE ABLE TO BE IN THE CONTEST?
YEAH. YOU CAN GET FREE TICKETS TO SHOWS I'M DOING THIS WEEKEND. WHICH IS AT THE ORPHEUM. IT'S A REALLY SMALL LITTLE THEATER.
Jimmy: YOU'RE KICKING IT OFF IN L.A.
AGAIN, LIKE A SHOCK. I DIDN'T EVER THINK I WOULD EVER PLAY THESE SONGS LIVE AGAIN. NOW I'M RELEARNING THEM, AND IT'S BEEN REALLY EXCITING. TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY WITH THE ROOTS.
I LOVE THEM. YOU GUYS ARE INCREDIBLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SING FOR US TONIGHT?
I'M GOING TO DO A LITTLE MEDLEY OF SONGS.
Jimmy: I LOVE MEDLEYS.
YEAH. I'M GOING TO BRING YOU BACK TO THE OLDEN DAYS.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
