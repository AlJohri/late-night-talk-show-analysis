"TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY." THANKS.
GOSH, YOU WERE SO FUNNY IN THAT.
OH, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I MEAN, WE DON'T SEE EACH OTHER THAT OFTEN, SO I CAN TELL YOU THIS STUFF.
WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU. I ONLY WORKED ON IT FOR A A COUPLE OF DAYS, BUT IT WAS REALLY FUN TO DO. GREAT DIRECTOR, AND --
Jimmy: YOU JUST HIT A HOME RUN. IT WAS JUST SO FUNNY.
JENNIFER GARNER TOLD ME SHE WAS AFRAID OF ME.
Jimmy: WHY?
BECAUSE I PLAYED A REALLY MEAN CHARACTER.
Jimmy: NO, YOU'RE SO FUNNY. SHE WAS NOT REALLY AFRAID.
I THINK SHE WAS KIDDING.
Jimmy: OH, DEFINITELY.
I HOPE. BECAUSE SHE'S REALLY NICE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SHE'S REALLY NICE. BUT IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER A LONG TIME.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
Jimmy: WHERE, WE FIRST MET --
WELL, I MET YOU FIRST -- MOLLY SHANNON'S LAST SHOW, THEY HAD A PARTY FOR HER UP ON THE ROOFTOP OF SOMETHING.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH. AND WE WERE CHATTING. YOU WERE BEING VERY FRIENDLY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I HAD JUST STARTED DATING MR. NICK OFFERMAN AND -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE WERE A NEW ROMANCE AT THAT POINT. AND HE CAME, LIKE, BARRELING OVER TO LIKE BREAK IT UP. SO I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DID HE REALLY?
I DON'T KNOW IF HE THOUGHT -- I THINK HE THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING.
Jimmy: WOW.
BUT I DON'T THINK WE DID. I THINK MAYBE HE DID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW IS HE DOING? HOW IS NICK?
HE'S GREAT. HE'S SHOOTING -- THEY'RE SHOOTING THEIR LAST EPISODE OF "PARKS AND REC."
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH.
TOMORROW'S THEIR LAST DAY. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Jimmy: IS IT TOMORROW? OH, REALLY, REALLY? OH, GOSH. YEAH, EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE EMOTIONAL.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THERE'S SO MANY FUN, NICE PEOPLE ON THAT CAST.
I KNOW. IT'S THE BEST CAST.
Jimmy: WE LOVE THEM SO MUCH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU'RE ON BROADWAY. THIS IS VERY, VERY EXCITING.
I AM.
Jimmy: THIS IS A BIG DEAL. IT'S SUPER FUN. I MEAN, EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS. YOU'RE SHATTERING RECORDS. IT'S MATTHEW BRODERICK. IT'S NATHAN LANE. IT'S MEGAN MULLALLY. YOU GET TO SEE YOU GUYS ALL ACTING. IT'S SUPER FUNNY. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT. I'VE JUST HEARD.
YEAH, COME SEE IT. I'M IN IT FOR THREE MORE WEEKS. SO HURRY! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH. BUT YOU'RE JUST SHATTERING RECORDS. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU'VE BEEN ON BROADWAY. BUT DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME GOING TO SEE A BROADWAY PLAY?
YES, IT'S KIND OF CRAZY BECAUSE THE FIRST BROADWAY PLAY I SAW, I WAS 16, AND IT WAS IN THE EXACT SAME THEATER WHERE WE'RE DOING THIS PLAY NOW.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
YEAH. IT USED TO BE CALLED THE PLYMOUTH, AND NOW IT'S CALLED THE SCHOENFELD. WHICH IS A MUCH MORE POETIC NAME FOR A THEATER, OF COURSE.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
BUT ANYWAY, IT WAS "EQUUS." IT WAS THIS PLAY CALLED "EQUUS," AND IT WAS THE BIG THING AT THE TIME. THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, IN THE '70s. AND MY PARENTS TOOK ME. AND IT WAS THIS REALLY SERIOUS SHOW. AND AT THE VERY END, THE LEAD GUY -- WHO WAS THIS YOUNG KIND OF CUTE GUY -- TAKES OFF ALL OF HIS CLOTHES AND JUMPS UP AND DOWN. AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MAN NAKED. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING. THERE WAS A LOT OF LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
KIND OF THIS ACTION. LIKE IT WAS JUST VERY -- YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: WE'LL HAVE TO BLEEP THAT OUT, YEAH. WE'LL HAVE TO BLUR THAT OUT ON TELEVISION. WERE YOUR PARENTS --
I COULDN'T MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OF IT, SO TO SPEAK. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON. I WAS JUST -- I WAS LIKE THIS. AND MY MOM KNEW THAT I'D NEVER SEEN -- WE'RE WITH MY MOM AND MY DAD, YOU KNOW? MY DAD'S LIKE FREAKING OUT. MY MOM GOT VERY -- WE STARTED GIGGLING. WE COULDN'T STOP. LIKE OVERCOME. BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT I'D NEVER SEEN A NAKED MAN. AND WE LITERALLY RUINED THE ENTIRE LIKE DRAMATIC APEX OF THE PLAY FOR THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE.
Jimmy: THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A BIG DRAMATIC SCENE WHERE THE GUY'S JUMPING UP AND DOWN?
YES, AND HIS NAME WAS PETER FIRTH. SO HE WAS MY FIRTH.
Jimmy: HE WAS YOUR FIRST. HE WAS YOUR FIRST PETER. HE WAS YOUR FIRST PETER, REALLY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
OH MY GOD! YEAH.
Jimmy: WE HAD TO DO IT. UP TOP, MAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOW, THIS GUY HERE -- IT'S KIND OF INSIDE BASEBALL, WE SHOULD TELL EVERYONE. THIS IS ALMOST ABOUT PEOPLE WAITING TO SEE A BROADWAY SHOW OPEN, RIGHT? "IT'S ONLY A PLAY."
IT'S LIKE RIGHT AFTER THE -- THE OPENING NIGHT OF WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE BIG BROADWAY SMASH HIT OF THE YEAR. IT'S JUST DIRECTLY FOLLOWING THE PERFORMANCE. AND THERE'S AN OPENING-NIGHT PARTY. AND MY CHARACTER -- I'M THE PRODUCER OF THE PLAY -- KIND OF SLIGHTLY DIM-WITTED PRODUCER OF THE PLAY. IN MY FABULOUS PENTHOUSE APARTMENT. AND WE'RE ALL NERVOUSLY WAITING FOR THE REVIEWS. SPECIFICALLY THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REVIEW TO COME OUT.
Jimmy: WHICH REALLY MAKES OR BREAKS A PLAY. WHAT IF THE "TIMES" SAY IT'S A A HIT OR IT'S A FLOP.
EXACTLY. AND I, IN REAL LIFE, PRETTY MUCH ALMOST EXACTLY DISAGREE EVERY SINGLE TIME. WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE, I LOVE, AND VICE VERSA. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. I GUESS I'M NOT VERY SMART.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S PERFECT. BUT THE TITLE IS ALWAYS TRICKY TOO. PEOPLE GO, WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE PLAY?
"IT'S ONLY A PLAY." PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "NO, WHAT'S THE NAME OF IT?" I'M LIKE, "IT'S ONLY A PLAY." THEY SAY, YEAH, BUT --
Jimmy: WHAT IS IT?
IT'S NOT A MUSICAL, BUT WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE PLAY?
Jimmy: WHO'S ON FIRST?
IT'S LIKE WHO'S ON FIRST. I'M SO SICK OF IT.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. COME ON, NOW. THIS IS FUN, AND YOU LOVE IT. YOU LOOK FORWARD TO SAYING IT.
NO, I'M SICK OF SAYING THAT BECAUSE IT'S SO CONFUSING.
Jimmy: NO, BECAUSE --
I'LL JUST CARRY THIS AROUND WITH ME.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU CAN DO IT. AND IT CARRY IT AROUND. IT'S VERY EXCITING TO DO THAT.
NO, IT'S GREAT. IT'S JUST HARD TO EXPLAIN.
Jimmy: TERRENCE --
TERRENCE McNALLY WROTE IT, AND JACK O'BRIEN DIRECTED IT. NATHAN LANE, MATTHEW BRODERICK.
