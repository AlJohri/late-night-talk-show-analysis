Jimmy: A-SHANA?
ASHTANGA.
Jimmy: ASHTANGA.
IT MEANS "EIGHT LIMBS."
SOMETIMES IT CAM BE REALLY UNINSPIRING BECAUSE THE TEACHER WILL SAY, "OH, DON'T WORRY. THAT'S JUST GONNA TAKE YOU TEN YEARS." AND YOU'RE LIKE, "WAIT. WHAT? I HAVE TO DO THIS PRACTICE?" THEY LOOP YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS PRACTICE FOR, LIKE, THREE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. BUT, I COULD SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT IF YOU WANT TO TRY. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: WE'LL LOOK BACK ON THIS IN TEN YEARS. WHEN I'M JUST, LIKE, CHILLIN' OUT, AND YOU'LL CALL ME, AND I'LL BE LIKE, "HEY, MILEY CYRUS. HOW ARE YOU DOING? JUST DOING MY ASHTANGA." NOW, WHAT IS IT CALLED AGAIN?
ASHTANGA.
Jimmy: ASHTANGA, GOOD. YEAH, ALL RIGHT. WANT TO GIVE ME A LITTLE LESSON?
OKAY, SO, I'M IN A SKIRT, BUT I'LL GIVE YOU A MINI LESSON. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: SO, SHOULD I TAKE MY JACKET OFF?
OKAY. IT'S GONNA BE REALLY, REALLY HARD.
Jimmy: OKAY, GREAT.
I'M JUST GONNA SHOW YOU A A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE NOTHING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN, BUT I'M JUST GONNA -- WE'RE ON AIR. ALL RIGHT. PUT YOUR HAND ON THE GROUND LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BEND OVER.
Jimmy: ALREADY?
PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE GROUND IF YOU CAN REACH. BEND YOUR KNEES. UH OH.
Jimmy: OKAY.
OKAY, THERE YOU GO. NOW, TAKE YOUR FEET, AND TAKE THEM ON EACH SIDE OF YOUR HANDS. YEAH, AND NOW --
Jimmy: NOTHING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE, FOLKS. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND NOW, PUT YOUR HAND BEHIND YOU. FLIP THEM LIKE THIS. FLIP THEM AND REVERSE IT. AND, NOW SIT DOWN.
Jimmy: NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND NOW, SIT YOUR LEGS STRAIGHT OUT.
Jimmy: NO, I CAN'T SIT DOWN.
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE END OF THAT.
Jimmy: WELL, WHAT IF I -- WELL, WHAT IF I -- CAN I START HERE?
WELL, YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR ARMS UNDERNEATH.
Jimmy: I KNOW. BUT THEY ARE -- THIS IS AS FAR AS WE'RE GONNA GET, ANYWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE --
PRETTY CLOSE.
Jimmy: IS THIS ASHTANGA?
THAT WORKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I FEEL GOOD. I FEEL GREAT. I FEEL REAL GOOD.
NAMASTE. IT LOOKED REALLY GOOD.
Jimmy: YEAH, AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S SO RELAXING. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU LOOK REALLY RELAXED.
Jimmy: WELL, IN TEN YEARS YOU WENT RECOGNIZE ME. [ LAUGHTER ] I'LL BE LIMPING AROUND. YOU GUYS, MORE WITH MILEY CYRUS WHEN WE COME BACK! I CAN'T. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! WE ARE HANGING OUT WITH MILEY CYRUS. BEAUTIFUL COVER, BY THE WAY RIGHT THERE. YOU'RE LOOKING GORGEOUS.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: NOW, YOU ARE A NEW -- YOU ARE A NEW COACH ON, "THE VOICE."
YEAH.
Jimmy: WELL, THIS IS EXCITING FOR ME BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE A GREAT COACH.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: DID YOU WATCH THE SHOW EVER AND GO, "I CAN DO THAT?"
I DIDN'T. I'VE ACTUALLY, I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE SHOW, AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN MY OWN EPISODES EITHER.
Jimmy: REALLY?
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I AM BUSY DOING THIS FOR TEN YEARS. SO I DON'T -- I DON'T WATCH TOO MUCH TV. AND --
Jimmy: ALSO, YOUR EPISODES HAVEN'T AIRED, YET, RIGHT?
WELL, I WILL ALSO SAY, THERE'S BEEN ONE.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE WAS A SNEAK PEEK, IF ANYONE CAUGHT IT AFTER THE OLYMPICS.
Jimmy: I DID SEE THAT.
THERE WAS A BIG, LIKE, ALL OF THE COACHES THAT HAVE BIG PERFORMANCE TOGETHER, WHICH IS REALLY COOL. BUT, WHAT MADE DO IT WAS I WENT THERE TO MENTOR BECAUSE I AM CLOSE TO PHARRELL, AND HE HAD ALWAYS LOVED THE EXPERIENCE. AND HE'S SOMEONE, HE'S LIKE ME. HE WOULDN'T SAY IT IF HE DIDN'T MEAN IT, YOU KNOW? AND HE REALLY LOVES --
Jimmy: HE HAS A GREAT ENERGY.
HE IS AMAZING. IT IS A SAFE PLACE. YOU GONNA REALLY NOT BE TOLD BY PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS TO WHAT DO. NONE OF THAT. YOU KNOW IF I AM SAYING IT, I MEAN IT TOO. THERE IS NOTHING ABUT IT THAT IS FAKE. AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE WITH OUR ARTISTS WHAT YOU SEE IS ONLY THIS MUCH OF, OF WHAT WE SHARE WITH THEM. I WISH EVERYONE COULD BE THERE AND SEE HOW MUCH THESE PEOPLE GROW. SO MUCH. YOU DON'T GET TO SEEP THEIR JOURNEY THE WAY THAT WE DO. IT IS SO, I AM SO INSPIRED BY MY TEAM. I CAN'T WAIT FOR EVERYBODY TO MEET THEM!
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. AND CHRISTINA WON LAST YEAR. SO WE NEED ANOTHER WIN FOR THE LADIES.
YEAH, WE DO.
Jimmy: WE DO. AND I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO BE WONDERFUL.
IF YOU SAY IT ENOUGH. IT WILL HAPPEN. I HAVE GOT SO MANY INCREDIBLE ARTISTS ON MY TEAM THAT I FEEL LIKE, I COULD WIN. BUT WITH ALL OF, IT COULD BE ANY ONE AND ANY DIFFERENT TYPE OF GENRE. NONE OF THEM ARE THE SAME. I HAVE EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: DO YOU ALL GO THE SAME GENRE? DID YOU GO A LITTLE COUNTRY? YOU KNOW THE COUNTRY SONGS.
NO, IT'S FUN. 'CAUSE EVEN WITH ALICIA, THERE'S BEEN A FEW COUNTRY DUDES. I'M LIKE, YOU SHOULD WORK WITH THEM. 'CAUSE, WHAT A WEIRD COMBINATION. THAT THAT WILL WORK. 'CAUSE IF SOMEONE DOING COUNTRY GOES WITH ME OR BLAKE. I SAY ALWAYS DO THE UNEXPECTED. HELLO? [ LAUGHTER ] ALWAYS DO THE UNEXPECTED! AND SO I THINK, FOR SOMEONE TO, EVEN WITH ADAM. HE GETS COUNTRY ARTISTS. I REALLY SEEING THAT. I LIKE SEEING WHAT WILL COME UP IN HIS LIBRARY. AND I LIKE TO THINK, MY COUNTRY CATALOG, IS DEEP. AND YOU KNOW, I, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PULL OUT SOME COOL TUNES, AND NEVER HAD BEFORE ON THE SHOW.
Jimmy: YOUR BRAIN WORKS, YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD BRAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW IS BLAKE SHELTON? I REALLY, REALLY LOOK HIM. I DO NOT THINK HE LIKES ME. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HE COMES ON. AND WE GET IN FIGHTS EVERY TIME HE COMES ON.
I SIT, ME, ALICIA IN BETWEEN BLAKE AND ADAM. WE DO THIS A LOT. JUST LIKE, "PLEASE -- SHH." [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW -- WITH MY CHARITY BEING SO IMPORTANT. IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME, FOR THIS NOT TO BECOME A "GIRLS VS. BOYS" SHOW. BECAUSE THAT'S AGAINST EVERYTHING I STAND FOR. IT'S NOT. IT'S ME AND ALICIA VERSUS BLAKE AND ADAM. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GIRLS AND BOYS. IT'S THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY. YOU ONLY SEE THIS MUCH OF MY ARTIST. YOU ONLY SEE HOW MUCH OF THEM. HOW MUCH WE HEAR IS WAY TOO MUCH.
Jimmy: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ]
IT NEVER STOPS. WHEN THE CAMERA IS OFF. THAT IS REAL. I THOUGHT THAT WAS THEIR LITTLE THING THEY DO ON CAMERA. NO, IT'S ALL DAY. ALL DAY.
Jimmy: YELLING AT EACH OTHER.
ADAM LOVES TO GO -- ♪ I'LL BE YOUR HONEY MUSTARD ♪ TO BLAKE ALL THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ I'LL BE YOUR CHICKEN WING ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN ADAM'S BEEN WEARING A A SUIT. AND REFUSES TO CALL ANYTHING BUT AN UBER DRIVER. ALLEY, HURRY UP, YOU HAVE TO GO YOUR UBER IS HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT GOES ON AND ON.
