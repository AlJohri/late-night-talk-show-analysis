Questlove: 516, STRONG ISLAND! YEAH.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Audience: U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
Jimmy: OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, THAT FELT GOOD. OH! I FEEL FANTASTIC. WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON, AND I'M ONLY WEARING THIS SO DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T DEPORT ME. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, EVERYBODY'S EXCITED ABOUT TONIGHT'S OPENING CEREMONY OF THE RIO OLYMPICS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EXCITING. IT'S GREAT. WASN'T IT GREAT? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU. MY FAVORITE PART WAS WHEN THEY HAD ALL THOSE GUYS DRESSED UP LIKE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS FRANTICALLY TRYING TO FINISH THE STADIUM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO REALISTIC. SO REALISTIC. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE. CONSTRUCTION CREWS WERE STILL FINISHING PARTS OF THE STADIUMS IN RIO RIGHT BEFORE THE OPENING CEREMONY. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. THEY WENT TO CUT THE RIBBON, AND THE WORKERS WERE LIKE, "STOP, THAT'S HOLDING IT TOGETHER! DON'T -- [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T CUT THAT. WAIT TILL IT DRIES. CUT IT IN A WEEK." OF COURSE, RIO HAS HAD ITS FAIR SHARE OF PROBLEMS THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS GETTING READY FOR THE OLYMPICS, BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR JUST ONE MOMENT THAT SORT OF SUMS IT ALL UP, I THINK THIS MIGHT BE IT.
AND NOW, ADDING INSULT TO INJURY, CHECK OUT THESE WORKERS USING BOLT CUTTERS TO OPEN THE GATES TO THE STADIUM TO TONIGHT'S VENUE AFTER REPORTEDLY LOSING THEIR KEY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT? THEY'RE GOING TO BE SO MAD WHEN THEY REMEMBER THE SPARE KEY UNDER THE FLOWER POT. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, "OH, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? I HAD A BOLT CUTTER." THIS HAD SOME PEOPLE DISAPPOINTED. THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE IS BANNING PEOPLE FROM USING THEIR FOOTAGE TO MAKE GIFs OR VINES, WHICH HAS A A LOT OF YOUNGER PEOPLE BUMMED OUT. BUT THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT MEMES. [ LAUGHTER ] SO WE WANTED TO HELP YOU GET STARTED. HERE'S A FEW OLYMPIC MEMES THAT WE CAME UP WITH. FIRST UP, THIS MEME SAYS, "SQUAT GOALS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THIS MEME SAYS, "WHEN BAE SEE THAT SEARCH HISTORY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: OOH.
Jimmy: HERE'S ANOTHER ATHLETE. HER MEME SAYS, "WHEN YOU REALIZE YOUR MOM JOINED FACEBOOK." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE, "NOOOO! NO!" [ APPLAUSE ] FINALLY, HERE'S A SPRING BOARD DIVER. HIS MEME IS -- "JUST HAD CHIPOTLE." [ LAUGHTER ] THERE YOU GO. THESE ARE MEMES TO GET YOU STARTED. YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH THEM. [ APPLAUSE ] GUYS, HERE'S AN ELECTION UPDATE. I READ THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IS STEPPING UP THEIR EFFORTS TO GET MILLENNIALS TO VOTE FOR HER IN NOVEMBER. WHEN HE HEARD THAT, DONALD TRUMP SAID, "I'M PRETTY SURE MILLENNIAL'S GONNA VOTE FOR ME. SHE'S MY WIFE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MILLENNIAL?" THIS IS PRETTY FUNNY. DONALD TRUMP UNVEILED HIS ECONOMIC POLICY TEAM TODAY, AND APPARENTLY IT'S MADE UP ENTIRELY OF MEN, SIX OF WHOM ARE ACTUALLY NAMED STEVE. [ LAUGHTER ] TRUMP WAS LIKE, "IN MY DEFENSE, YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT HAS TO FIND WOMEN NAMED STEVE? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN -- I TRIED. [ APPLAUSE ] RIGHT, MILLENNIAL?" [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT A FEMALE REPORTER ASKED DONALD TRUMP ABOUT HOW MANY WOMEN WOULD BE IN HIS CABINET IF HE BECAME PRESIDENT. AND TRUMP'S ANSWER WAS PRETTY GOOD NEWS FOR THE REPORTER. TAKE A LOOK.
WHO YOU WOULD ACTUALLY PUT INTO OFFICE AS ONE OF YOUR FIRST FEMALES IN YOUR CABINET?
WELL, WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT ONES TO CHOOSE. THERE REALLY ARE SO MANY THAT ARE REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE, LIKE YOU. YOU ARE SO TALENTED AND -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: HOW DID YOU CONVINCE HIM TO DO "SAUSAGE PARTY?" THIS IS FANTASTIC!
IT WAS GREAT. WE OFFERED HIM MONEY AND THEN HE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, OKAY.
I THINK HE PROBABLY CALLED THE ACADEMY TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN'T TAKE AWAY YOUR OSCARS AT ANY POINT, THAT THERE'S NO ACTION THAT MAKES YOU REMOVE THEM. AND THEN HE DID IT. AND WE RECORDED SCORE AT ABBEY ROAD STUDIO LIKE, ON THE MICROPHONE, THEY RECORDED RINGO STAR AND STUFF ON, LIKE, IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. I KEPT BEING LIKE, THIS IS WAY TOO GOOD FOR THIS MOVIE.

SETH AND I ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A A LIP SYNC BATTLE. NOW HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. WE'LL TAKE TURNS LIP SYNCING SECTIONS OF WELL-KNOWN SONGS. EACH ONE OF US TRYING TO LIP SYNC BETTER THAN THE OTHER. WE DON'T KNOW WHICH SONGS THE OTHER PERSON'S PICKED. ONLY THE PERSON PERFORMING KNOWS WHICH SONG IS COMING NEXT. WE'LL DO TWO SONGS EACH. SETH, SINCE I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE, I'M GOING TO START US OFF TONIGHT.
FANTASTIC, GO FOR IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
