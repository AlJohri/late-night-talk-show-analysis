Jimmy: PEOPLE LOOK FORWARD TO SHOWING OFF THEIR DRESS.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: 'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T WIN AN OSCAR, YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY CAMERA TIME.
NO, NONE AT ALL. AND YOU ARE LIVE. YOU COULDN'T GET CUT OUT. WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE WOULD FLOCK TO US.
Jimmy: YEAH, I TOLD EVERYONE TO WATCH THE DOCUMENTARY OF YOUR MOM. IT'S JUST SO MANY GREAT THINGS, YOU SEE HOW HARD WORKING SHE WAS. SHE WAS ON STAGE WITH YOU WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH YOU DOING STAND UP.
YEAH, SHE WENT INTO LABOR ON STAGE.
Jimmy: REALLY?
APPARENTLY SHE FELT HER LABOR PAINS.
Jimmy: THAT WAS HER CLOSER HOPEFULLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, IT GETS BETTER. YOU HAD TO BE ON STAGE A A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME BEFORE YOU GOT PAID. SO SHE ACTUALLY FINISHED HER ACT. SHE CAUGHT HER BREATH, FINISHED HER ACT AND THEN WENT HOME, HAD A SANDWICH, WATCHED A A JOHN WAYNE MOVIE AND THEN WENT TO THE HOSPITAL. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT RIGHT THERE. ABSOLUTELY.
CRAZY.
Jimmy: THERE ARE SO MANY FUN THINGS IN HERE THAT I WANTED EVERYONE TO SEE. CHECK OUT THE BOOK AND SEE ALL THE THINGS. ESPECIALLY FOR MOTHER'S DAY. IT'S A GREAT BOOK TO READ ABOUT YOUR MOM.
YES.
Jimmy: BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST WANT TO SHOW QUICKLY IS A REPORT CARD FROM THE FIRST GRADE.
THIS IS IN THE BOOK.
Jimmy: JOAN'S REPORT CARD FROM THE FIRST GRADE.
YES. I NEED MY GLASSES. IT SAYS, "JOAN'S VOICE IS STILL LOUD AND SHE TRIES TO GAIN ATTENTION THIS WAY. WE'RE CHECKING THIS HABIT AS IT OCCURS AND SEEING THAT IT'S THE ATTENTION SHE WISHES IS NOT FORTHCOMING WHEN SHE IS LOUD." YEAH, THAT'S THE BEST ONE. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST.
Jimmy: THIS ONE IS IN FOURTH GRADE, REPORT CARD, JOAN RIVERS.
YES.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP.
YOU CAN'T. "JOAN IS A HAPPY, INTELLIGENT CHILD. SHE HAS LEARNED TO BE SELF RELIANT AND TO GAIN RECOGNITION THROUGH ACCOMPLISHMENTS RATHER THAN COMPLAINING." SHE IS FAST OVERCOMING HER TENDENCY TOWARD BRIBERY IN ORDER TO WIN FRIENDS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I LOVED HER SO MUCH.
ONE OF THE THINGS -- I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE SOMETHING FOR ME?
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU. I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MY MOTHER LOVED YOU. AND I WAS TOLD BY YOUR STAFF THAT WE HAVE THE WHOLE JOKE CARD FILE. NOW FOR SOME REASON YOU WERE OBSESSED THAT MY MOTHER ACTUALLY HAD A JOKE ON TONY DANZA IN THE JOKE FILE.
Jimmy: SHE HAS A FILE ON THE WALL THAT'S LIKE THOUSANDS OF JOKES AND SHE GOES, "I'M SEEING TONY DANZA. DO WE HAVE ANY JOKES ON TONY DANZA?" SHE LOOKED THROUGH A FILE.
THERE IS ONE TONY DANZA JOKE. AND THERE IT IS FOR YOU.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH.
THE ACTUAL CARD.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE REAL CARD? [ APPLAUSE ]
IT'S THE REAL CARD.
Jimmy: ARE YOU KIDDING ME? OH, MY GOSH.
READ THE JOKE.
Jimmy: IT SAYS, THIS IS A A TONY DANZA JOKE. "WOULDN'T IT BE A MAJOR LET DOWN TO FIND OUT THAT TONY DANZA IS IRISH?" [ LAUGHTER ]
IT WOULD BE.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH. IT MEANS A LOT TO ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: MELISSA RIVERS, EVERYBODY. "THE BOOK OF JOAN" IS AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE. WE HAVE STAND-UP FROM JEFF GARLIN AFTER THE BREAK, STICK AROUND EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST STARS ON THE HIT COMEDY SHOW, "THE GOLDBERGS," WHICH AIRS WEDNESDAYS AT 8:30 PM ON ABC. PLEASE GIVE A WARM WELCOME TO THE VERY FUNNY, JEFF GARLIN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AN HONOR TO BE HERE. ALL RIGHT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A STORY. I HOPE YOU DIG IT. SO, I'M AT THE AIRPORT. GOING THROUGH SECURITY. AHEAD OF ME IN LINE IS AN OLD BLACK MAN AND HE PUTS HIS BAG ON THE SECURITY THING AND GOES THROUGH AND THE SECURITY GUARD, THE LADY SAYS "EXCUSE ME, WHO'S BAG IS THIS?" "THAT'S MY BAG." "YES, YOU HAVE TOO MANY TOILETRIES." "NO, I NEED MY CREAM. I NEED MY LOTION. I NEED IT WITH ME AT ALL TIMES." "YES, BUT YOU HAVE TOO MUCH." "NO, I HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT." [ LAUGHTER ] "I LOVE MY CREAM." I LOVE MY LOTION. I NEED IT WITH ME AT ALL TIME." "WELL YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO CHECK YOUR BAG AND YOUR CREAMS AND YOUR LOTIONS WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU AT YOUR DESTINATION." "YOU MUST THINK I NEVER FLOWN BEFORE. MY BAG WILL BE WAITING AT MY DESTINATION FOR ME WITH MY CREAM AND LOTION? THAT'S CRAZY TALK." WELL, SO NOW IT'S NOT ESCALATING AT ALL. OKAY. IT'S "CREAM," "NO," "LOTION," "NO.' AND I'M JUST STANDING THERE LIKE AN IDIOT. SO I GO IN THE NEXT LINE. GO THROUGH SECURITY, GO TO MY GATE AND GET ON THE PLANE. ALL RIGHT. ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER WHO SITS DOWN NEXT TO ME, BARON VON CREAM. [ LAUGHTER ] AND JUST KNOW I REALLY WANT TO TALK TO HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] SO WE -- I KNOW. WE TAKE OFF. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THAT TO SHOW YOU -- [ LAUGHTER ] AS IF SOMEONE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TAKING OFF IS. WHAT'S THE THING HE'S DOING WITH HIS HAND? [ LAUGHTER ] UP? ALL RIGHT I'LL GO WITH IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT -- ALL RIGHT. SO I SAY TO HIM AS WE TAKE OFF, HEY, WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOUR CREAMS AND LOTIONS? "YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT?" [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DO I SAY, AT STARBUCKS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT. "WELL, YOUNG LADY TOLD ME I COULD PICK MY FIVE FAVORITE CREAM AND LOTION WHICH I DID AND I GAVE THE REST TO HER AND SHE THREW IT AWAY. SHE HAS TERRIBLE SKIN. SHE SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT." ALL RIGHT. SO NOW WE'RE FLYING AND I'M LIKE WHAT DO I SAY NEXT? I WANT TO KEEP IT GOING, YOU KNOW. I GOT IT! LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A A CREAM AND A LOTION? [ LAUGHTER ] "YOU DON'T KNOW?" NO I DON'T, I HAVE NO IDEA. "WELL, LOTION, THAT'S WATER BASED. YOU CAN APPLY IT LIBERALLY ALL OVER YOUR BODY." [ LAUGHTER ] "CREAM, THAT'S OIL BASED. A LITTLE DAB WILL DO YEAH." [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW, I COULDN'T BELIEVE HE SAID IT. SO I'M LIKE I GOT TO HEAR THAT AGAIN. SO I SAY, I'M SORRY, I'M JUST NOT GETTING THAT. CAN YOU -- I APOLOGIZE. "LISTEN TO ME, LOTION, WATER BASED GO ALL OVER YOUR BODY. IT'S OKAY. CREAM NOW, THAT'S OIL BASED. A LITTLE DAB WILL DO YEAH." [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO DO IT AGAIN BUT I DON'T WANT TO INSULT HIM AND MAKE HIM THINK I'M MAKING FUN. ALL RIGHT, LET ME ASK YOU A A QUESTION, OKAY. SO LOTION, THAT'S WATER BASED. I CAN GO NUTS, RIGHT? WHAT'S CREAM? "LISTEN TO ME." [ LAUGHTER ] "LAST TIME. ALL RIGHT? CREAM THAT'S OIL BASED. A LITTLE DAB WILL DO YEAH." [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T ASK HIM AGAIN. GREATEST FLIGHT OF MY LIFE. BUT WHAT IT DID WAS INSPIRE ME. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH MY MONEY, I DECIDED THIS. YOU CAN'T TALK ME OUT OF IT. I'M GONNA -- AND IT WILL FREAK PEOPLE OUT 'CAUSE IT MAKES NO SENSE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO OPEN UP MY OWN CHAIN OF LOTION SHOPS. JEFF GARLIN'S HOUSE OF LOTIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD LOTIONS AT GOOD PRICES. BECAUSE IF MY NAME'S ON IT, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A A GREAT LOTION, I GOTTA -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT. I GOT A SHOW. I GOT A FAMILY. I GOT TO DO JIMMY'S SHOW. I'M BUSY! I DON'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE A A GREAT AND DO THE RESEARCH AND THE HARD WORK. BUT MY NAME'S ON IT. IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD LOTION. [ LAUGHTER ] AT A GOOD PRICE.
