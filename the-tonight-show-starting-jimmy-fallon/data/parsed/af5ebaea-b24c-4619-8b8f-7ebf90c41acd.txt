"I THOUGHT YOU WERE DONE WITH IT." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT WAS WRONG. I ADMIT THAT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] THOSE ARE SPECIAL MEMORIES AND THEY'RE GONE NOW. BUT THE POINT IS THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL THINGS ON EARTH ONLY EXIST IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF BECOMING GARBAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY? YOUR HOME IS A GARBAGE PROCESSING CENTER WHERE YOU BUY NEW THINGS, BRING THEM INTO YOUR HOUSE AND SLOWLY CRAPIFY THEM OVER TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OKAY? THIS IS YOUR LIFE.

[ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN SOME TIME GOES BY AND IT SLOWLY BEGINS TO DAWN ON YOU THAT MAYBE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE QUITE AS KEEN ON DRYING OUT FRUIT AND STORING IT IN YOUR BASEMENT AS YOU THOUGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU HAVE TO DEMOTE IT. OBJECTS START AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL VISIBLE IN A LIVING AREA. FROM THERE, IT GOES DOWN TO A A CLOSEST, CUPBOARD OR DRAWER. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THOSE, SO WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE ALL OF THE HUGE MISTAKES WE HAVE MADE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. FROM THE CLOSET IT GOES TO THE GARAGE, ONE OF THE LONGEST PHASES IN TRASHIFICATION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT THE MOST DEFINITE. NO OBJECT HAS EVER MADE IT OUT OF THE GARAGE AND BACK INTO THE HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE WORD "GARAGE" SEEMS TO BE A A FORM OF THE WORD "GARBAGE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT IT IS. ONCE YOU ARE LIVING IN THE SAME ROOM AS THE GARBAGE CANS, WELL, IT WON'T BE MUCH LONGER NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] REALLY, EBAY IS THE ONLY THING THAT CAN SAVE THE OBJECT AT THIS POINT. EBAY, ANOTHER GREAT STEP FORWARD IN HUMAN CULTURE. HEY, WHY DON'T WE MAIL OUR GARBAGE BACK AND FORTH TO EACH OTHER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHY TALK TO YOUR FAMILY AT NIGHT WHEN YOU COULD BE BIDDING $8 TO $10 ON A TROLL DOLL FROM THAILAND? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OR A PERSONAL STORAGE UNIT. THIS IS THE SADDEST OF ALL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NOW, INSTEAD OF FREE GARBAGE, YOU PAY RENT TO VISIT YOUR GARBAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE A PRISON VISIT WHEN YOU GO THERE ISN'T IT? EVERYTHING'S LOCKED UP. EVERYTHING'S RUSTED AND BROKEN. YOU GOT TO BUST INTO THAT LOCK, YOU LIFT UP THAT ROLLING STEEL DOOR. LOOK, I'M TRYING TO GET YOU GUYS OUT OF HERE, OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S NO PLACE FOR YOU IN THE WORLD. I'M LOOKING. I'M WORKING ON IT. I WILL BE BACK TO SEE YOU AGAIN SOON. [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYTHING -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY POINT IS SIMPLE, EVERYTHING IS THROWN OUT IN THE END. WE ARE THROWN OUT IN THE END, MY FRIENDS. AND WHEN I HEAR ABOUT SOMEONE THAT DIED AND WANTED CERTAIN IMPORTANT PERSONAL POSSESSIONS PUT IN WITH THEM WHEN THEY'RE BURIED, I'M ALL FOR THAT. TAKE YOUR CRAP WITH YOU.
