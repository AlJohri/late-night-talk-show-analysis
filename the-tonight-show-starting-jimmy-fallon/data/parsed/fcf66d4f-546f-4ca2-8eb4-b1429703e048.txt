YEAH. THEY DIDN'T SURPRISE ME WITH IT.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS. NO ONE ASKS ME TO MODEL SWIMSUITS, AND HE GOES, "JIMMY, WE'RE DOING THIS ONE NAKED, BUDDY." AND I GO, NO.
I DIDN'T WALK IN TO EXPECTING TO SEE BIKINIS AND SAW BUCKETS OF PAINT. IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE GETTING INTO.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HOW LONG DID THIS PROCESS TAKE?
14 HOURS, BOTH TIMES. I HAD TO DO IT TWICE. AND THEN FLY ALL NIGHT THE NIGHT BEFORE.
Jimmy: OH, GEEZ.
THAT'S HOW I LOOK LIKE WHEN I DON'T SLEEP FOR TWO DAYS.
Jimmy: NOT TOO SHABBY. CONGRATULATIONS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH. YOU LOOK GREAT. HERE'S YOUR OTHER, THIS IS YOUR OTHER SUIT, I SHOULD SAY, AS WELL.
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO LOOK THAT COMFORTABLE?
Jimmy: SERIOUSLY. WELL DONE, PAL.
THANKS.
Jimmy: I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE YOU WERE ON THE SHOW LAST. THIS IS RIGHT BEFORE YOU WENT UP TO FIGHT HOLLY HOLM. AM I SAYING HER NAME RIGHT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I HATE TO BRING IT UP BUT IS THERE GOING TO BE A A REMATCH?
OF COURSE.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ CHEERS ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: SCHEDULED REMATCH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT THERE'S LIKE A A RULE, LIKE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO FIGHT ANYONE RIGHT NOW, RIGHT?
I MEAN, I PROMISED THAT I WOULD FILM "ROADHOUSE" AFTER THE LAST MOVIE, I MEAN, AFTER THE LAST FIGHT AND SO --
Jimmy: YOU'RE FILMING "ROADHOUSE"? YEAH, SO I MADE A PROMISE AND THAT'S IT. MY WORD MEANS SOMETHING AND I'M GOING TO FILM "ROADHOUSE" FIRST, AND THEN --
Jimmy: RE-DOING THE FILM "ROADHOUSE," PATRICK SWAYZE, CLASSIC?
THE SWAYZE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ARE YOU PATRICK SWAYZE?
I'M THE SWAYZE.
Jimmy: YOU'RE PATRICK SWAYZE IN "ROAD HOUSE"? ♪♪ THAT'S THE BEST IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD, EVER. THAT'S FANTASTIC.
WELL, NO MAN COULD EVER BE THE SWAYZE LIKE HE DOES. SO YOU HAVE TO COMPLETELY RE-IMAGINE IT IN ORDER TO REDO IT.
Jimmy: HOW GREAT. ARE YOU SHOOTING THAT RIGHT NOW?
HOPEFULLY WE'LL START LIKE, AROUND MAY. WE'LL SEE.
Jimmy: OH MAN, THAT'S GONNA BE FANTASTIC. I GOT TO SAY ALSO, THERE'S A A MARINE THAT ASKED YOU -- I GUESS PEOPLE DO THIS NOW. THEY ASKED YOU ON TWITTER WAS IT? OR HOW DID THEY ASK YOU?
I THINK IT WAS A YOUTUBE VIDEO OR SOMETHING THAT HE PUT OUT.
Jimmy: AND HE WANTED YOU TO GO WITH AND BE HIS DATE FOR THE MARINE CORPS BALL.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND YOU SAID YES. AND THEN THE FIGHT HAPPENED. AND IT WASN'T GREAT. AND PEOPLE WERE GOING, WELL, MAYBE RONDA, SHE CAN'T DO IT, AND PEOPLE JUST LIKE -- BUT, YOU ACTUALLY DID SHOW UP AND YOU WENT TO -- HERE'S THE PICTURE OF YOU AND LANCE CORPORAL JARED HASCHERT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT WAS NICE OF YOU TO DO THAT.
YEAH. IT WAS AWESOME, HE WAS A REAL SWEETHEART.
Jimmy: WAS IT FUN.
ACTUALLY IT REALLY WAS. AND THAT WAS LIKE, I THINK, THE FIRST TIME I SMILED AT ALL, LIKE SINCE, AND IT WAS GOOD TO GET OFF THE COUCH AND NOT JUST BE, LIKE, CRYING, EATING ICE CREAM ALL DAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH, WE WENT TO THE BALL AND THEN WE WENT TO HOOTERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AS ONE DOES.
YEAH, AND I GOT IN AN ARGUMENT ABOUT MYSELF. IT WAS GREAT. SO THIS ONE, THIS ONE HOOTER'S CHICK COMES UP TO ME AND SHE WAS, LIKE, OH, YEAH, WE HAVE FIGHTS HERE ALL THE TIME. SHE WAS, LIKE, WE LOVE WATCHING RONDA ROUSEY FIGHTS. AND I WAS, LIKE, OH, I HATE HER. SHE'S THE WORST. SHE'S SUCH A BITCH. I CAN'T STAND HER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SHE GOT REALLY OFFENDED. SHE WAS, LIKE, NO, SHE'S AWESOME, OKAY? AND WE MAKE LOTS OF MONEY IN TIPS WHEN SHE FIGHTS. AND SHE WENT INTO THIS WHOLE BIG ARGUMENT ABOUT ME, WITH ME. AND I WAS LIKE --
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU'RE SAVING [ INAUDIBLE ] THE HOOTERS, THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE BUSINESS MODEL. THAT'S FANTASTIC. DID YOU EVENTUALLY LET HER OFF THE HOOK?
YEAH. SHE THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS. AND I THINK I GOT SOME FREE WINGS. [ LAUGHTER ]
