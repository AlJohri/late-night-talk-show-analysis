[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN HE SAID -- [ RUSSIAN ACCENT ] BUT I WOULD PREFER TO BE RESCUED BY DAVID HASSELHOFF. HE'S A HOT PIECE OF -- THAT'S RIGHT. VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID HE THINKS PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD SAVE HIM IF HE WERE DROWNING. AND THE PRESIDENT WAS LIKE, WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SORRY, DUDE! AND THIS IS COOL. THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED THAT HAD FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA WILL APPEAR ON THE SHOW NASHVILLE NEXT MONTH. WHILE JOE BIDEN WILL MAKE HIS THIRD APPEARANCE ON "WIPEOUT." THIS TIME, I'M NOT FALLING. I KNOW WHEN THIS BOXING GLOVE COMES OUT. ALL ABOUT TIMING, MAN! I WANT TO SAY CONGRATS TO CHELSEA CLINTON. LAST WEEK SHE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE IS EXPECTING HER FIRST CHILD.

A VERY BIG SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY THAT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND. RESEARCHERS IN GREENLAND HAVE DISCOVERED DIRT FROM 2.7 MILLION YEARS AGO. UNDERNEATH A SHEET OF ICE. A PRETTY AMAZING FIND. ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENT. I AM A MAN WHO DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO SCIENCE AND I JUST FOUND SOME DIRT. DUG THROUGH A WHOLE BUNCH OF ICE IN GREENLAND AND FOUND REALLY OLD DIRT. [ LAUGHTER ] IN FACT IF YOU COULD GOOGLE GREENLAND AND OLD DIRT, MY NAME MIGHT COME UP SOMEWHERE IN THAT LIST. THAT'S KIND OF SOMETHING RIGHT? WHEN WE WERE IN GREENLAND, CAN WE STOP CUTTING THROUGH ICE? I WAS LIKE, NO, DON'T. [ LAUGHTER ] PROBABLY -- PROBABLY DIRT DOWN THERE. SO WE KEPT CUTTING AND SURE ENOUGH, THERE WAS DIRT. REALLY OLD DIRT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ONCE I FOUND WHAT I THOUGHT WAS OLD DIRT BUT IT TURNED OUT IT WAS JUST MODERN DIRT. OH WELL.

Steve: LONG STATEMENT.
Jimmy: LONG STATEMENT. I GUESS YOU'D GIVE A LONG STATEMENT.
Steve: HE HAD A LOT TO SAY.
Jimmy: TALKING TO DIRT ALL THE TIME. THIS ISN'T GOOD, YOU GUYS. KRAFT FOODS IS RECALLING 96,000 POUNDS OF OSCAR MEYER HOTDOGS BECAUSE THEY MAY CONTAIN CHEESE WHICH COULD BE DANGEROUS TO PEOPLE WITH DIARY ALLERGIES. THAT'S RIGHT. OSCAR MEYER RECOMMENDED CUSTOMERS TRY THEIR REGULAR HOTDOGS WHICH ARE ONLY DANGEROUS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO HOOVES. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY WOULD THEY RELEASE THAT STATEMENT? THEY SAY THEY'RE RECALLING THE HOTDOGS BECAUSE THEY SAY THERE'S AN ERROR ON THE LABEL. YOU KNOW, THAT THING THAT YOU NEVER READ IF YOU'RE BUYING HOTDOGS.

Steve: MEAT BYPRODUCTS?
Jimmy: THEY PLUMP WHEN YOU COOK THEM, HONEY! SOME MOVIE NEWS HERE. THE JOHNNY DEPP MOVIE "TRANSCENDENCE" DID NOT DO WELL AT THE BOX OFFICE THIS WEEKEND. IT'S ABOUT JOHNNY DEPP'S CHARACTER BECOMING ONE WITH TECHNOLOGY WHERE HE ESSENTIALLY BECOMES A ROBOT.

[ BUZZING ] IT JUST SEEMS LIKE -- IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT'S -- ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] MAYBE I'M WRONG. I DON'T KNOW. BASEBALL SEASON IS UNDERWAY AND NOW THAT HE'S IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE, METS PITCHER BARTOLO COLON HAS TO GO UP TO BAT BECAUSE THERE IS NO DESIGNATED HITTER. HE HAS TO SWING THE BAT. AND THIS IS A PICTURE OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. [ LAUGHTER ] DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK HE'S DOING. I DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. I HAVEN'T DONE THIS IN YEARS. GOOD NEWS HE GOT TWO GRAND SLAMS. THE BAD NEWS IS IT WAS AT DENNY'S.

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LIKE, "A BIG, GIANT BUNNY CAME BROUGHT US CANDY. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE." WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE WERE KIDS, ME AND MY SISTER, WHEN WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER. AND WE HID HARD BOILED EGGS AROUND OUR HOUSE. AND WE FORGOT WHERE WE HID THEM ALL.
I'VE DONE THAT.
Jimmy: WE DID PLASTIC EGGS AND HID THEM AND THE KIDS FOUND THEM.
I ACTUALLY HAD AN EASTER EGG HUNT A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHERE I MADE A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE PLACE THAT I HID IT. BECAUSE WE GET CRITTERS, WE GET RACCOONS AND THINGS IN THE BACK YARD. SO I WENT BACK AND I WAS LIKE, "WHO GOT THE ONE IN THE TREE?" YOU KNOW AND THE PLANTS ARE -- "I GOT IT. CHECK, CHECK."
