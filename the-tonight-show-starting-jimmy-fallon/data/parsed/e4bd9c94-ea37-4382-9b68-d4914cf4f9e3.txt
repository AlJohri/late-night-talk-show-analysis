[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, TONIGHT WAS THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC DEBATE OVER ON CNN. AND GET THIS, DID YOU HEAR THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD AN EXTRA PODIUM READY JUST IN CASE JOE BIDEN DECIDED HE'D JOIN THE RACE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT BACKFIRED WHEN, BEFORE THE DEBATE EVEN STARTED, PEOPLE WERE LIKE, "CAN WE JUST VOTE FOR THE EMPTY PODIUM?" AND THEY GO, NO, YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL -- [ APPLAUSE ] CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD, THE EMPTY PODIUM'S IN THE LEAD. I SAW THAT ONE OF BERNIE SANDERS' CAMPAIGN ADVISERS SAID THAT THEY WANT HIM TO TONE DOWN HIS YELLING AT TONIGHT'S DEBATE. YOU COULD TELL HE WAS YELLING TOO MUCH, BECAUSE I HAD TO KEEP TURNING THE VOLUME UP TO HEAR THE COMMERCIALS. [ APPLAUSE ] AND I WAS LIKE, NO, THAT'S SOMETHING WRONG. HE'S YELLING TOO LOUD. AND TRUMP DIDN'T HAVE TOO MANY NICE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT TONIGHT'S DEBATE. SURPRISE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IN FACT, HE SAID THAT HE THINKS PEOPLE WOULD TURN ON THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN FALL ASLEEP. THEN CNN WAS LIKE, "HEY, IT STILL COUNTS. RATINGS ARE RATINGS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE LOVE IT. [ APPLAUSE ] WE'LL TAKE IT. FALL ASLEEP. WE DON'T CARE. LEAVE IT ON." SINCE TONIGHT'S DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WAS IN LAS VEGAS, YOU COULD PLACE BETS ON JUST ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF THE EVENT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FOR REAL. I MEAN, YOU COULD BET ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES HILLARY WOULD SPEAK, THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ANDERSON COOPER WOULD ASK. AND IT DIDN'T END THERE. TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE OTHER DEBATE PROP BETS. FIRST UP, HOW LONG WILL THE AUDIENCE STAY IN THEIR SEATS AFTER THEY REALIZE THEY'RE NOT AT A CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHOW CALLED "DE BATE?" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT, HOW MUCH WILL HILLARY CLINTON PAY DAVID COPPERFIELD TO MAKE BERNIE SANDERS DISAPPEAR? [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A BET. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, HOW LONG WILL THE STANDING OVATION BE WHEN JOE BIDEN RIDES IN ON A DIRT BIKE, GRABS THE MIKE AND SAYS, I'LL TAKE THIS ONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT'S UP?
Steve: YEAH!
Jimmy: AND IN WASHINGTON, REPUBLICANS ARE STILL CALLING FOR PAUL RYAN TO RUN FOR SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE EVEN THOUGH HE'S ALREADY SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO RUN. WHEN ASKED WHY HE WON'T RUN, RYAN SAID "BECAUSE TODAY IS ARMS AND SHOULDERS, TOMORROW IS CARDIO." [ APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ GRUNTING ]

PIERZYNSKI HAD SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING -- VERY INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS. JUST LISTEN TO THIS.
COLBY RASMUS IS SO HOT RIGHT NOW, THAT AS AN -- AS AN OPPOSING PLAYER IN BP, IF IT WASN'T THE PLAYOFFS, YOU'D GO UP TO HIM AND YOU'D JUST RUB ON HIM JUST TRY TO GET SOME OF HIS HOTNESS ON YOU. THAT'S WHAT GUYS DO WHEN THEY'RE HOT. YOU TRY TO RUB UP ON 'EM TO GET SOME OF THEIR -- GET SOME OF THEIR HOTNESS, GET SOME OF THEIR FEEL. HOPEFULLY IT RUBS OFF ON YOU ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND THEN THE UMPIRE IS LIKE, YOU'RE OUT. YOU'RE OUT. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. CALM DOWN, BUDDY. SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANNA RUB UP ON THEM -- WHAT HAPPENED IS I WOULD RUB UP AGAINST HIM IF I COULD. AND NO ONE KNEW ABOUT IT, I WOULD RUB UP AGAINST HIM BECAUSE HE'S SO HOT. [ LAUGHTER ] A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS, "PLAYBOY" ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS GOING TO STOP PUBLISHING PHOTOS OF NUDE WOMEN IN ITS MAGAZINE. [ AUDIENCE GROANS ] EVEN CRAZIER, THE MAGAZINE "JUGGS" IS NOW ABOUT ACTUAL WATER PITCHERS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] I DON'T MIND, I THINK IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

HE'S SO GREAT.
Jimmy: HOW FUN WAS THAT? YOU LOOK GREAT IN THE MOVIE. YOU'RE LIKE A '50s TEENAGE GIRL.
I KNOW, I'VE GOT HAIR CURLERS AND I'M HIDING UNDER A A TABLE AND EATING PEANUT BUTTER.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND YOU'RE WATCHING "ROUTE 66." I MEAN, IT WAS JUST FANTASTIC. I LOVED THAT.. I LOVED THE MOVIE, AS WELL. HOW FUN IS THAT, YOU GET TO WORK WITH STEVEN SPIELBERG?
IT WAS SO FUN. I MEAN, I WAS OBSESSED WITH "E.T." WHEN I WAS A KID.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I CUT OFF ALL MY HAIR AND MADE EVERYONE CALL ME ELLIOT. I WAS ABSOLUTELY A BOY FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS OF MY CHILDHOOD.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH, MY MOM WOULD BE LIKE, EVE, DINNER'S READY. I WOULD BE LIKE --
Jimmy: HIDING IN ALL YOUR STUFFED ANIMALS.
SORRY, ELLIOT, DINNER IS READY.
Jimmy: AW, NO WAY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THEN, YOU ALSO WORKED WITH THE OTHER STEVEN, STEVEN SODERBERGH.
YES. I ONLY WORKS WITH STEVENS NOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU ONLY WORK WITH FAMOUS DIRECTORS NAMED STEVEN, YEAH. WHO DO YOU PLAN TO WORK WITH NEXT, IN THE FUTURE?
STEVEN FINCHER.
Jimmy: OH YEAH, OF COURSE.
STEVEN SCORSESE.
Jimmy: STEVEN SCORSESE, HE'S A GREAT GUY. YEAH, YEAH, HE'S MARTIN'S BROTHER. YEAH, HE'S REALLY FUN.
INCREDIBLY TALENTED GUY.
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT THE THING ABOUT SODERBERGH AS WELL, I HEARD THAT YOU CHARMED YOUR WAY INTO SEEING AN EARLY CUT OF "MAGIC MIKE XXL."
WELL, I DID.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND HE PRODUCED IT?
HE PRODUCED IT. HE DIDN'T DIRECT IT THIS TIME, BUT HE SHOT IT.
YOU REALLY WANTED TO SEE THE SEQUEL.
I MEAN, "MAGIC MIKE" IS HIS FINEST WORK.
Jimmy: YEAH, ARGUABLY. BUT YEAH.
FORGET "ERIN BROCKOVICH." FORGET "TRAFFIC." IT'S "MAGIC MIKE."
Jimmy: "MAGIC MIKE", EVERYONE KNOWS IT.
SO, I BEGGED HIM FOR A LONG TIME IF I COULD SEE THE MOVIE. AND HE SHOWED IT TO US. AND I WAS SO OVERCOME WITH EMOTION. I HAD SUCH A CATHARTIC EXPERIENCE AS THEY WERE PLAYING DeANGELO THAT I STARTED CRYING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAIT, YOU CRIED DURING "MAGIC MIKE XXL"?
I CRIED. AND STEVEN LOOKED AT ME AND HE GOES, ARE YOU CRYING? BECAUSE THAT'S HOW HE TALKS.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD IMPRESSION, BY THE WAY.
AND I WAS LIKE, YEAH. AND HE GOES, IF ONLY I KNEW THAT WAS YOUR TRIGGER, I WOULD HAVE CHANNING TATUM COME AND DANCE FOR YOU WHEN YOU HAVE TO CRY ON "THE KNICK." [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: FROM DUBLIN.
I ACTUALLY GOT A LOT OF TROUBLE LAST TIME I WAS ON THE SHOW FROM ALL MY FRIENDS FROM DUBLIN BECAUSE THEY WERE LIKE, "WE SAW YOU ON JIMMY FALLON. YEAH YOU WERE REALLY GOOD, BUT YOU SOUNDED AMERICAN."
Jimmy: OH. THEY DON'T LIKE THAT, NO. IN FACT, NOW, I DON'T WANT TO SOUND AMERICAN. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUR FRIENDS. I DON'T WANT THE WRATH. YOU GET TO DO THIS STUFF. IT'S SHOT SO WELL, IF YOU WATCH "THE KNICK." AND THE CRITICS LOVE IT AS WELL. BUT, IT'S JUST SHOT BEAUTIFULLY. NOW CLIVE OWEN, WE JUST HAD ON THE SHOW. HE'S A GREAT GUY AS WELL. IF YOU LOOK BACK, YOU'RE THE NURSE ON THE SHOW. AND YOU HAVE THE WEST VIRGINIA ACCENT.
I DO.
Jimmy: HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT? DO A LITTLE BIT, COULD YOU SAY HEY, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW"?
I COULD SAY, "I'M WEARING BALMAIN. IT'S MY DRESS, I'M WEARING BALMAIN."
Jimmy: NOW, BALMAIN, IS THAT A NAME OF A DESIGNER? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS.
YEAH, APPARENTLY. IN FRANCE, THEY CALL IT BALMAIN.
Jimmy: OH, BALMAIN. I KNOW THAT, OF COURSE.
YEAH, IT'S BALMAIN.
Jimmy: I WEAR MICHAEL STRAHAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, IT'S FANTASTIC. JCPENNEY. JCPENNEY, ALL THE WAY. FANTASTIC. SO CLIVE OWEN, WE WERE TALKING TO CLIVE. LAST SEASON, HIS CHARACTER WAS ADDICTED TO COCAINE BECAUSE COCAINE WAS LEGAL, AND ALL THE DOCTORS DID COCAINE TO STAY UP.
YEAH, IT WAS THE THING TO DO.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE. SO TO GET HIM OFF COCAINE, THEY STARTED HIM IN A TREATMENT. NOW HE'S ADDICTED TO HEROIN.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S CRAZY.
AND THAT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: IT REALLY HAPPENED.
THEY REALLY DID TREAT COCAINE FRENZY WITH HEROIN.
