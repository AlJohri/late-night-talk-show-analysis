Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- ICE CUBE. RACHEL MADDOW. MUSICAL GUEST KHALID FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 639, SASKATCHEWAN! YEAH!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: A-HA! HEY! WELCOME, EVERYBODY! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME! WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, BABY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT, BABY BROTHER!
I LOVE YOU, JIMMY!
Jimmy: LOVE YOU TOO, SIR. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. YOU GUYS, WE HAVE ICE CUBE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE ALSO HAVE RACHEL MADDOW ON THE SHOW TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOT SHOW. HOT SHOW. OF COURSE, RACHEL'S IN THE NEWS BECAUSE SHE GOT A HOLD OF DONALD TRUMP'S 2005 TAX RETURN ON HER SHOW. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SAYING, THOUGH, IT DIDN'T REALLY SHOW MUCH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO, I GUESS LAST NIGHT PEOPLE HAD TO PICK BETWEEN WATCHING "THIS IS US" OR "THIS IS NOTHING." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'LL TALK TO HER ABOUT THAT. BUT GET THIS, THE TAX RETURN APPARENTLY HAD A CLIENT COPY STAMP ON IT. MANY THINK IT CAME FROM SOMEONE VERY CLOSE TO TRUMP. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] AND MELANIA SAID, "WELL, I GUESS I'M OFF THE HOOK." [ APPLAUSE ] "I MEAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM. I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM SINCE JANUARY. TELL HIM I SAID HI." BUT AT FIRST, SOME PEOPLE WERE SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHETHER TRUMP'S TAX FORM WAS REAL OR NOT. BUT WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE DETAILS. IT DEFINITELY SEEMED LIKE TRUMP FILED IT. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR DEPENDENTS, HE WROTE, "IVANKA, DON, JR., AND WHAT'S HER NAME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: THAT SEEMED -- THEN FOR TAX-EXEMPT INTEREST, HE WROTE, "I'M VERY INTERESTED IN BEING TAX EXEMPT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION. AND FINALLY, FOR LINES 36, 24, AND 38, HE JUST CIRCLED THE NUMBERS AND WROTE, "PERFECT MEASUREMENTS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT SEEMS REAL.
Steve: IT SOUNDS LIKE HIM.
Jimmy: SEEMS PRETTY REAL. DAVID CAY JOHNSTON HAD A LOT TO SAY WHEN HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY RACHEL MADDOW. I NOTICED THERE WAS ONE POINT HE SHOWED A PRETTY INTERESTING LAUGH. CHECK THIS OUT.
RUSSIANS WHO ARE AROUND PUTIN AND WOULD BE BORROWING MONEY FROM BEIJING?
MM-HMM. [ LAUGHS NERVOUSLY ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS A LAUGH OR A SNEEZE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: A-CHOO! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, THE WHITE HOUSE IS ALSO CRITICIZING RACHEL MADDOW SAYING IT'S TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO STEAL AND PUBLISH TAX RETURNS. YEP. THEY SAID THE DOCUMENT WAS RELEASED THE PROPER WAY, BY HAVING A RUSSIAN HACKER GIVE THEM TO WIKILEAKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT. THAT'S HOW YOU GET THEM RELEASED. IT SEEMS LIKE THESE LEAKS HAVE EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON WORRIED. IN FACT, A WHITE HOUSE AIDE SAYS THAT WHEN HE GETS HOME, HE TURNS OFF HIS WORK PHONE AND PUTS IT IN A DRAWER BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID IT COULD LISTEN TO HIM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, WHEN SHE GETS HOME, KELLYANNE CONWAY HIDES HER MICROWAVE IN THE CLOSET. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SHE'S LIKE, "I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT THING. HOT POCKET FIRST, THEN I'M UNPLUGGING IT, PUTTING IT IN THE CLOSET." [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S GET TO SOME SPORTS NEWS. I SAW THAT THE NEW YORK JETS TRIED TO GET FREE AGENT DONT'A HIGHTOWER OVER THE WEEKEND BY GIVING HIM CUPCAKES AND WISHING HIM A HAPPY BIRTHDAY ON EVERY TV IN THE BUILDING. HIGHTOWER SAYS IT WAS NICE, BUT IT ONLY COUNTS IF THEY SAY IT ON FACEBOOK. AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT, RIGHT? [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW THAT. COME ON. LISTEN TO THIS. I READ THAT RUSSIA MAY HAVE TROUBLE GETTING ATHLETES TO COMPETE IN THE 2018 OLYMPICS AFTER THE BIG DOPING SCANDAL. PEOPLE WERE CONFUSED. THEY WERE LIKE, "WAIT. YOU CAN RIG AN ELECTION BUT NOT A URINE TEST?" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WAIT, WHAT -- WHAT'S THE RULES?
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: HOW DOES THAT -- AND FINALLY, THIS IS KIND OF NICE. I SAW THAT THE CAST OF "JERSEY SHORE" REUNITED IN HERE NEW YORK THE OTHER DAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: I GUESS IT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN TIMES SQUARE ELMO AND TIMES SQUARE COOKIE MONSTER TOOK THEIR HEADS OFF, AND THEY WERE LIKE, "SNOOKI? THE SITUATION? HI! HOW ARE YOU?" HEY, WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: HE PUT SOMETHING ON SOUNDCLOUD OR SOMETHING. IS THIS THE TRUE STORY, OR DID I MAKE THIS UP?
Steve: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: HE PUT LIKE A SONG ON SOUNDCLOUD. HE'S JUST A HIGH SCHOOL KID. HE'S LIKE, "OH, WELL, I WAS DOING THE SONG." AND HE DOES THIS. NO, HE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, HE PUTS IT SOUNDCLOUD, AND IT JUST TAKES OFF. AND HE HEARS IT ON THE RADIO.

YEAH. THAT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE THINGS, YOU'RE LIKE, AM I DEAD?
Jimmy: I MEAN, IT WAS A A GIANT DEAL.
I GOT HOME LAST NIGHT AND SUSAN BOUGHT ME NEW SNEAKERS. SHE WENT OUT WHEN SHE FOUND OUT I GOT THE SCOOP SHE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ME NEW SNEAKERS. I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE GOT THEM IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AT LIKE 7 O'CLOCK AT NIGHT. SHE SAID THESE ARE YOUR "YOU GOT THE PRESIDENT'S TAX RETURN" SNEAKERS."
Jimmy: YEAH! EXACTLY, YEAH.
THIS IS NOW A A BOUNTY FOR ANYBODY WHO GETS THE REST OF THEM, I SUPPOSE. I WILL THEN GIVE YOU THESE SHOES.
Jimmy: YOU GET SOME COOL STAN SMITHS.
YES.
Jimmy: WALK ME THROUGH THIS. WHEN DID YOU GET THE SCOOP AND WHEN DID YOU -- HOW DOES IT HAPPEN? DO PEOPLE JUST SEND YOU THINGS ALL THE TIME, LIKE LEAKED DOCUMENTS?
SO, WE HEARD ON FRI -- SORRY ON MONDAY, THAT DAVID CAY JOHNSTON, WHO IS AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, PULITZER PRIZE WINNER, HE'S A A REALLY GOOD JOURNALIST, SPECIFICALLY ON TAXES AND FINANCES, HE SAID THAT HE HAD OBTAINED -- SOMEBODY HAD SENT HIM, WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE ONE OF DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS. AND HE WAS IN THE PROCESS OF DOING HIS DUE DILIGENCE TO FIGURE OUT IF IT'S REAL. BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY ALL OF US IN THIS BUSINESS ARE WORRIED THAT LIKE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO SLIP US A FORGED DOCUMENT, OR SOMETHING FAKE AND IT'S LIKE A A TRAP. SO HE'S DOING HIS DUE DILIGENCE. HE SAID "IF WE CAN VERIFY IT, DO YOU WANT TO PUT IT ON TV?" AND I SAID, "HM, YES." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A MILLISECOND.
BUT WE NEED TO DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE, TOO. LIKE, WE REALLY NEED TO BE SURE THIS IS THE REAL THING.
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
SO, THAT STARTED MONDAY. WE SPENT ALL DAY MONDAY TRYING TO VERIFY THAT THIS WAS A REAL DOCUMENT, THESE WERE REAL NUMBERS. THIS WAS REALLY THE PRESIDENT'S TAX RETURNS. THAT WENT OVERNIGHT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE NIGHT MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AND WE SPENT ALL DAY TUESDAY ON IT. AND REALLY THE THING THAT WE NEEDED, WE TALKED TO TAX EXPERTS, WE TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THESE THINGS LOOK LIKE, WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD TO VALIDATE THE CHAIN OF EVIDENCE IN TERMS OF HOW IT GOT TO DAVID. BUT WE NEEDED THE WHITE HOUSE TO TELL US IF IT'S REAL. AND, WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY WERE GOING TO REACT WHEN WE CONTACTED THEM. WE GAVE THEM A NUMBER OF HOURS TO RESPOND AND IT'S GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER AND CLOSER TO AIR TIME ON TUESDAY AND WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY WERE GOING TO -- WHAT THEY WERE GONNA SAY. AND IN FACT, YESTERDAY WAS NUTS BECAUSE WE HAD TO HAVE KIND OF PLAN B AND PLAN C READY. LIKE WHAT IF THEY CAME BACK TO US AND PROVED TO US IT WAS A A FORGERY, IT WAS A FAKE DOCUMENT, WE COULDN'T GO TO AIR WITH IT?
Jimmy: DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER SHOW PLANNED?
WE HAD A WHOLE OTHER SHOW PLANNED. WE PRODUCED TWO COMPLETE SHOWS YESTERDAY. ONE WAS WE'VE GOT HIS TAX RETURNS. AND ONE WAS NOTHING TO SEE HERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE'RE LEADING WITH SOMETHING -- WE HAD DIFFERENT GUESTS BOOKED, A WHOLE DIFFERENT SHOW COMPLETELY LINED UP AND READY TO GO, IN CASE IT FELL THROUGH. AND THEN IN THE 7:00 HOUR THEY FINALLY VALIDATED AND AUTHENTICATED THE DOCUMENT AND SAID, YES, THAT'S TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS. AND SO IT WAS ALL SYSTEMS GO. WE GOT A STATEMENT FROM 'EM, YOU KNOW, THEY STARTED CALLING US FAKE NEWS, BLAH BLAH BLAH. AND THEN WE WENT TO AIR.
Jimmy: YEAH. I MEAN, WHAT'S THAT FEEL LIKE WHEN THE WHITE HOUSE GOES, YEAH. WHAT YOU HAVE IS REAL?
WELL, I MEAN, FOR US IT WAS SO ALL SYSTEMS GO, AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD IT NAILED DOWN RIGHT. I THINK THE REASON PEOPLE GOT SO EXCITED ABOUT THE NEWS WHEN I TWEETED OUT IN THE 7:00 HOUR WE'VE GOT IT, WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON TV. I THINK THE REASON PEOPLE ARE SO EXCITED ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE, IT'S REALLY WEIRD THAT THE PRESIDENT HASN'T RELEASED HIS FINANCIAL INFORMATION.
Jimmy: IT'S ODD.
IT'S REALLY ODD, AND THERE'S REASONS TO WORRY ABOUT IT. LIKE WE'VE HAD THAT FROM EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE NIXON. WHY IS THIS THE ONE WHO WON'T RELEASE IT, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING WORRIES DAY BY DAY, FURTHER INCREASING WORRIES ABOUT HIS CONTACTS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES LIKE RUSSIA. I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY CONCERNED TO SEE WHAT'S IN THOSE TAX RETURNS. AND SO WHEN WE FOUND OUT THAT WE HAD ONE, IT WAS LIKE SPEAKING TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE DYING OF THIRST IN THE DESERT AND WE WERE LIKE, BEHOLD! WE HAVE FOUND A DROP! A DROP! YOU HAVE A DROP!
Jimmy: WE HAVE A DROP OF WATER!
AND THEN IT'S LIKE, YEAH, IT IS JUST A DROP. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE -- THIS ISN'T SCANDALOUS INFORMATION. THERE'S NOTHING --
Jimmy: WHY ONLY TWO PAGES?
THAT'S WHAT WE GOT.
Jimmy: WOW. SO SOMEBODY MAILED US TWO PAGES, THE 1040 FORM FROM HIS 2005 TAX RETURN. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO SENT IT TO US, BUT THE WHITE HOUSE CONFIRMS IT IS AUTHENTIC.
Jimmy: BECAUSE THIS -- WHAT YOU REVEALED LAST NIGHT WASN'T THAT SCANDALOUS.
NOT AT ALL. WE KNOW HE PAID TAXES. OKAY, SO, WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS, THEN? THERE'S NOTHING EMBARRASSING HERE.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND HOW DOES DAVID CAY JOHNSTON REACT TO THIS? DOES HE JUST GO, YEAH, JUST CHECKING MY MAIL. THERE WAS LIKE THIS THING IN MY MAILBOX. LIKE, WAIT. WHAT? LIKE, WAS IT ROLLED UP IN AN L.L. BEAN OR J. CREW WITH LIKE A RUBBER BAND? OH, THAT'S PRETTY COOL. WHAT'S THIS? OH, MY GOODNESS!
IT'S DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS!
Jimmy: I HAVE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE -- YEAH.
YEAH. WELL, APPARENTLY HE WAS OUT OF TOWN. HE WAS -- HE SAID THAT WHERE HE WAS, WAS IN PALM BEACH INVESTIGATING ONE OF DONALD TRUMP'S REAL ESTATE DEALS. BUT WHILE HE WAS IN PALM BEACH LOOKING AT THAT, ONE OF HIS KIDS OPENED HIS MAIL, WAS GOING THROUGH HIS MAIL WAS LIKE, DAD! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. WE HAVE A SCOOP.
WE GOT A THING!
Jimmy: THAT'S THE THING. I MEAN, IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE TO WATCH. BECAUSE HE SAID, YEAH, COULD EASILY BE LEAKED BY SOMEONE FROM TRUMP'S CAMP.
SURE, YEAH.
Jimmy: BECAUSE TRUMP HAS BEEN KNOWN TO LEAKS THINGS IN THE PAST.
IF IT COULD COME FROM ANYBODY, IT COULD JUST AS EASILY COME FROM -- I MEAN ONE THING IN FAVOR OF THE IDEA THAT IT CAME FROM HIM, IS THAT, HE'S THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD LEAK IT TOTALLY LEGALLY WITHOUT ANY CONCERNS ABOUT GETTING SUED BY TRUMP OR ANYBODY ELSE. RIGHT? BECAUSE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR OWN TAX RETURNS. YOU COULD RELEASE THEM OF YOUR OWN ACCORD. THEY'RE NOT THREATENING THE LEAKER ON THIS. THEY TRIED TO THREATEN US FOR PUBLISHING THEM WHICH IS COMPLETE BULL. BUT, I TAKE THE THREAT IN THE SPIRIT IN WHICH IT WAS INTENDED. BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIM.
Jimmy: HE TWEETED ABOUT IT THIS MORNING SAID "DOES ANYBODY REALLY BELIEVE -- DOES ANYBODY REALLY BELIEVE THAT A REPORTER WHO NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF WENT TO HIS MAILBOX AND FOUND MY TAX RETURNS?"
AND THEN "FAKE NEWS" AT THE END.
Jimmy: AND "FAKE NEWS" AGAIN, YEAH.
IF YOU WANT -- IF YOU WANT YOUR WHITE HOUSE TO AUTHENTICATE THIS DOCUMENT AND SAY "THAT IS A REAL DOCUMENT," THAT'S ONE THING. IF YOU ALSO WANT TO SAY, "THAT IS FAKE," THAT'S ONE THING. BUT YOU THEN YOU CAN'T BE THE SAME PERSON. YOU CAN'T BE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT SAYING SAYING AUTHENTIC, FAKE, AUTHENTIC, FAKE. THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. THEY SPEAK IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGE ON THIS?
Jimmy: YEAH.
I MEAN, I'M HAPPY TO DEAL WITH EITHER ONE OF THESE ASSERTIONS, THAT IT'S AUTHENTIC, OR THAT IT'S FAKE. BUT PICK ONE.
Jimmy: PICK ONE OR THE OTHER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND I WANT TO TALK TO YOU A A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT TRUMP, IF YOU DON'T MIND WHEN WE COME BACK.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: MORE WITH OUR GUEST, RACHEL MADDOW WHEN WE COME BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH RACHEL MADDOW. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. I APPRECIATE IT.
OH, SUPER HAPPY TO.
Jimmy: I HAVE QUESTIONS. SO MANY QUESTIONS LIKE, DO YOU HAVE -- DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE OF HIS TAX RETURNS THAT YOU MIGHT RELEASE?
LIKE THAT I'M HARBORING FOR A SECRET REVEAL? NO. I JUST HAVE THIS -- NO. BUT SOMEBODY -- THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S INTERESTING. I MEAN WAS THERE A HUGE DAMNING BOMBSHELL IN THESE TAX RETURNS? NO. THE BOMBSHELL HERE IS THAT SOME OF HIS TAX RETURNS HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN HE'S BEEN TRYING SO HARD TO KEEP THEM SECRET. SO I WANT TO -- I DO WANT TO KNOW WHO SENT THEM. I HAVE NO IDEA. I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM, AND I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE PRESIDENT WON'T RELEASE MORE OF THEM. I MEAN HE'S BEEN SORT OF BRAGGING TODAY ABOUT HOW, YEAH, THOSE WEREN'T EMBARRASSING AT ALL. LOOK HOW MUCH MONEY I MADE. HIS KIDS HAVE BEEN BRAGGING ABOUT HOW RICH HE IS AND HOW MUCH IT SHOWS HE PAID IN TAXES. GREAT, IF YOU'RE PSYCHED ABOUT THIS, GIVE US SOME MORE BECAUSE WE ALSO WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE BIG LOANS TO LIKE RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS OR WHATEVER.
Jimmy: WHAT'S THE WORST THING THAT COULD COME OUT OF THESE THINGS?
THE REASON YOU WANT ANY PRESIDENT'S TAX RETURNS IS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW IF HE HAS -- IS BEHOLDEN TO ANYBODY. IF HE'S GOT LOANS FROM SOMEBODY OR IF ANYBODY'S SORT OF INEXPLICABLY SHOVELED HIM A LOT OF MONEY WITHOUT A LEGIT REASON WHY. YOU WANT TO KNOW IF HE MIGHT BE ACTING AS PRESIDENT WITH DIVIDED LOYALTIES. HE MIGHT BE USING THE RESOURCES OF THE UNITED STATES TO PAY OFF SOMEBODY THAT HE OWES SOMETHING TO AND WE CAN'T -- I'M NOT SAYING HE IS DOING ANY OF THOSE THINGS BUT WE CAN'T KNOW UNLESS WE CAN SEE IT. AND THAT'S WHY EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT BACK TO WATERGATE HAS RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS. THAT'S WHY IT REMAINS A CONCERN THAT HE HASN'T, AND THAT'S WHY WHAT WE GOT LAST NIGHT -- I'M PSYCHED TO HAVE IT, SORT OF THE FIRST PIECE IN THE JIGSAW PUZZLE, BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE. HE NEEDS TO ACTUALLY DISCLOSE HIS -- [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DO YOU THINK HE DOES HAVE TIES WITH RUSSIA? DO YOU THINK HE'S LYING TO US AND THAT HE --
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN WE DON'T -- NONE OF US KNOW. I MEAN IT COULD BE -- SO IN THE CAMPAIGN PEOPLE WERE LIKE, "OH, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS," OR "MAYBE HE DOESN'T PAY ANY TAXES," OR "MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE SAYS," OR "MAYBE HE'S NOT REALLY UNDER AUDIT." LIKE ALL THOSE LITTLE THINGS MIGHT BE TRUE. OKAY. THAT'D BE INTERESTING TO KNOW. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WOULD CHANGE THE WORLD THAT MUCH, BUT WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE WORLD IS IF, YOU KNOW, RUSSIA WAS INTERFERING IN THE ELECTION AND THEY WEREN'T DOING IT ON THEIR OWN, AND HE WAS IN ON IT. YOU KNOW? AND IF HE'S GOT TIES TO RUSSIA, IF HE'S GOT TIES TO CHINA, IF HE'S GOT TIES TO FOREIGN BANKS, IF HE'S GOT ANY SORT OF FINANCIAL ENTANGLEMENTS THAT MIGHT AFFECT HIS DECISION MAKING, MIGHT CHANGE WHAT HE DOES ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTRY, SO AS TO DEAL WITH HIS PERSONAL STUFF. WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW THAT. IT'S A NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERN. AND IF -- AND IF NONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE, IF HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE ENTANGLEMENTS, THEN SHOW US THE TAX RETURNS SO WE CAN STOP FREAKING OUT ABOUT IT. BECAUSE OTHERWISE, WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORRY THAT THAT MIGHT SECRETLY BE WHAT'S DRIVING HIM, AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T SHOW US WHAT EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT HAS SHOWN US, THAT WOULD SET OUR MINDS AT EASE IF IT'S NOT TRUE. I DON'T KNOW WHY HE WOULDN'T RELEASE THESE TAX RETURNS IF THERE REALLY ISN'T ANYTHING EMBARRASSING IN THEM, AND THE ONE BIT THAT WE GOT LAST NIGHT SHOWED NOTHING EMBARRASSING.
Jimmy: YEAH. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO YOU BEING THE PERSON THAT IT WAS LEAKED TO? I MEAN, YOU'RE THE PERSON NOW. YOU'RE WINNING. YOU'RE BEATING FOX NEWS. YOU'RE THE NUMBER ONE SHOW AND YOU'RE THE PERSON THAT PEOPLE GO, YEAH, I WANT TO SHARE MY INFORMATION WITH HER NOW.
I MEAN HONESTLY, IT JUST FEELS LIKE A REALLY BIG RESPONSIBILITY. LIKE, GOT TO GET IT RIGHT. LIKE, HAVE TO NOT ONLY NOT GET PLAYED, MAKE SURE THIS IS REAL INFORMATION, YOU KNOW, NOBODY'S SENDING US A FORGERY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GIVEN THE WHITE HOUSE -- WE GIVE THEM HOURS TO RESPOND TO THIS. WE'RE TREATING THEM FAIRLY ON THIS. I'M NOT GOING TO -- I'M NOT GOING TO ONLY PUT OUT INFORMATION THAT I FIND THAT'S TERRIBLE FOR THE PRESIDENT. IF I CAN ADVANCE THIS STORY, I'M GOING TO PUT IT OUT NO MATTER WHETHER IT IS GOOD OR BAD FOR THE PRESIDENT. I WANT TO BE TRUSTWORTHY TO MY AUDIENCE. I TAKE IT REALLY SERIOUSLY THAT SOMEBODY TRUSTED ME WITH THIS INFORMATION. AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PLUGGING AWAY. WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS THING ANSWERED. WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT ABOUT HIS FINANCES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FOR THE COUNTRY, AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT PIECE BY PIECE BY PIECE.
Jimmy: CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR COMING ON OUR SHOW.
