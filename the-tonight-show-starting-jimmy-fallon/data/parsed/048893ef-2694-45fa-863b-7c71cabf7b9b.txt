Questlove: 518! UPSTATE!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: USA! USA! USA! USA!
Audience: USA! USA! USA! USA!
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS! WELCOME, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," BABY! WE'RE HERE! WE DID IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE, YOU MADE IT! OH, WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN TONIGHT. IT'S A GREAT SHOW, YOU GUYS. I'M SO EXCITED. WE HAVE THE GOLD MEDAL-WINNING U.S. WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS TEAM ON THE SHOW TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] STICK THE LANDING, FALLON. STICK IT. LISTEN TO THIS, THOUGH, IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT TWO-TIME OLYMPIAN GABBY DOUGLAS, WHO IS HERE -- SHE'S GONNA BE ON THE PANEL OF JUDGES AT THE 2017 MISS AMERICA COMPETITION. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO, GOOD LUCK IMPRESSING HER IN THE TALENT PORTION. [ LAUGHTER ] "YEAH, NICE BATON TWIRLING. CAN YOU DO A TRIPLE BACK FLIP WITH A TWIST?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH. SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS RYAN LOCHTE STORY. YEAH, APPARENTLY LOCHTE LOST ALL FOUR OF HIS ENDORSEMENT DEALS YESTERDAY FOLLOWING HIS RIO ROBBERY SCANDAL. IN FACT, HE'S SO DESPERATE FOR MONEY, HE'S ACTUALLY CONSIDERING ROBBING A GAS STATION. WHICH IS JUST -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S CONSIDERING IT.
Steve: THAT'S IRONIC.
Jimmy: HE'S CONSIDERING. DIDN'T SAY HE WAS.
Steve: HE'S NOT REALLY DOING IT.
Jimmy: NOT A SIGNED DEAL, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, RYAN LOCHTE LOST ALL HIS BUSINESS DEALS IN JUST ONE DAY. EVEN TRUMP WAS LIKE, "IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO DO THAT." [ LAUGHTER ] "THIS GUY IS FAST. THIS GUY IS FAST." [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S NOT THE ONLY SCANDAL OUT OF THE OLYMPICS. SOME INTIMATE PHOTOS HAVE SURFACED OF USAIN BOLT WITH A A BRAZILIAN WOMAN THIS WEEK, EVEN THOUGH HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND OF TWO YEARS BACK IN JAMAICA. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] HIS GIRLFRIEND IS PRETTY UPSET. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PHOTO I SAW TODAY. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD LUCK. GOOD LUCK. [ APPLAUSE ] [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LET'S GET TO SOME ELECTION NEWS.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. I READ THAT A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY IS ACTUALLY RUNNING ONE OF TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN OFFICES IN COLORADO. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED HOW AN INEXPERIENCED CHILD COULD BE RUNNING THINGS, THE BOY SAID, "LOOK, HE'S THE NOMINEE AND WE'RE STUCK WITH HIM. SO WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO DO WHAT WE" -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOW THAT HE IS OFFICIALLY THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, TRUMP HAS BEGUN RECEIVING CLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY BRIEFINGS. OF COURSE, THIS HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE WORRIED, BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID TRUMP MIGHT TWEET OUT SENSITIVE INFORMATION OR BLURT SOMETHING OUT DURING A SPEECH. SOME PEOPLE EVEN THINK THE PENTAGON MAY BE GIVING TRUMP FAKE INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS TO KEEP THAT FROM HAPPENING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEY MAY BE ON TO SOMETHING. BECAUSE, LOOK, HERE'S A LOOK AT AN ACTUAL REPORT ON AFGHANISTAN. IT SAYS, "U.S. TROOPS SHIFT COURSE TO PREVENT TALIBAN ADVANCEMENT." THE ONE TRUMP RECEIVED SAID, "TROOPS PROVIDE ALADDIN WITH NEW FLYING CARPET TO BATTLE JAFAR." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
Steve: THAT'S GOOD.
Jimmy: THERE'S A A DIFFERENCE --
Steve: THAT'S DIFFERENT.
Jimmy: THE ACTUAL REPORT ON RUSSIA SAID, "THEY ARE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN SUSPECTED ESPIONAGE." THE ONE TRUMP RECIVED SAID, "SOME OF THE STUFF JAMES BOND DOES IN 'MOONRAKER' IS KIND OF REAL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: KIND OF REAL.
Steve: KIND OF.
Jimmy: IT'S KIND OF REAL. TRUST ME, I'VE SEEN CLASSIFIED -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, THE ACTUAL REPORT ON NORTH KOREA SAID, "KIM JONG-UN THREATENING NUCLEAR STRIKE AMID SOUTH KOREAN MILITARY DRILL." THE ONE TRUMP RECIEVED SAID, "KIM JONG-UN GIGGLES WHEN YOU TOUCH HIS BELLY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK THAT'S TRUE THOUGH.
Steve: THAT IS TRUE, THOUGH.
Jimmy: I DID HEAR SOMEWHERE THAT'S TRUE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] A LITTLE CELEBRITY NEWS HERE. OVER THE WEEKEND, LEONARDO DiCAPRIO AND HIS GIRLFRIEND, MODEL NINA AGDAL, GOT IN A SMALL FENDER BENDER IN THE HAMPTONS. AFTERWARD DiCARPRIO SAID, "MY WHOLE LIFE FLASHED BEFORE MY EYES. AND IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I HAD A GREAT LIFE. I HAVE A GREAT LIFE." THIS SEEMS KIND OF WEIRD, BUT KFC JUST UNVEILED A SUNSCREEN THAT SMELLS LIKE EXTRA CRISPY FRIED CHICKEN. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IF YOU WANT TO SMELL LIKE KFC, THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE YOU ALREADY DO. LET'S BE HONEST. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GREASE GETS ALL OVER. YEAH. YOU GUYS, "THE BACHELOR IN PARADISE" WAS ON LAST NIGHT. [ CHEERS ] OH, MAN. ISN'T IT FANTASTIC? OH, I LOVE IT. SO ONE OF THE GUYS WAS FEELING PRETTY ROMANTIC. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT DANIEL SHARING HIS FEELINGS WITH HIS DATE.
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU, OBVIOUSLY, I WAS ATTRACTED. BUT AS TIME GOES ON, I'M EVEN MORE ATTRACTED TO YOU. WHEN I SEE YOUR BUTT, I'M LIKE, "DAMN, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S AMAZING." AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SAVE IT FOR YOUR WEDDING VOWS, MAN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HOW ROMANTIC. BUT THAT WASN'T THE ONLY GOOD IDEA DANIEL HAD. HE ALSO GAVE SOME GOOD ADVICE TO THE OTHER GUYS IN THE HOUSE. LISTEN TO THIS.
IF I COULD GIVE JARED ADVICE, IT'D BE LIKE, LISTEN, YOU'RE GREAT GUY, NICE GUY. IF CAILA DOESN'T WANT YOU, THEN SHE DOESN'T DESERVE YOU. YOU SHOULD TRY TO BE A BIG DOG LIKE ME AND MAYBE YOU COULD CREATE A LITTLE WOLF PACK AND ROAM FREE. YOU KNOW, FIND, UH, SOME LITTLE PUPPIES TO SNAG AND BRING IN TO OUR DEN TOGETHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: THIS GUY'S STARTING TO MAKE RYAN LOCHTE LOOK LIKE ALBERT EINSTEIN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I CAN'T TELL IF HE'S TALKING ABOUT MEETING WOMEN OR TRYING TO START A FAMILY WITH THAT OTHER GUY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE'LL RAISE PUPPIES TOGETHER. OF COURSE, ANOTHER BIG REALITY SHOW IS COMING OUT, "THE NEW CELEBRITY APPRENTICE" FEATURING ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. I SAW THAT HIS NEW TAG LINE IS "LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS." [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE TRUMP'S ALREADY USING "HASTA LA VISTA" AS HIS IMMIGRATION SLOGAN. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN'T USE THAT.
Steve: YOU CAN'T.

WELL THE THING IS WITH US, WE USUALLY LIKE TO JUST RIDE AROUND,
Jimmy: YOU'RE DOLLY PARTON, YEAH, YOU GO, HELLO. CAN I PARK HERE?
WE JUST PARK, GO TO BED IN THE CAMPER. WE DON'T SLEEP THAT MUCH. WE USUALLY DRIVE UP --
Jimmy: HEY WHY, WHY, WHY --
THAT'S WHY WE'VE LASTED 50 YEARS.
Jimmy: ARE YOU MARRIED 50 YEARS?
50 YEARS WE'VE BEEN MARRIED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I FIND AN INTERESTING TIDBIT, WE GOT MARRIED -- AGAIN, WE RENEWED OUR VOWS, AND WE GOT MARRIED IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED RINGGOLD, GEORGIA, WHICH IS JUST ABOUT THREE HOURS OUTSIDE OF NASHVILLE, OUT OF TENNESSEE. SO, WE GOT MARRIED AGAIN. WE TOOK THE RV, AND WE WENT DOWN AND SPENT THE NIGHT, WE JUST GOT FAST FOOD AND ATE ON OUR CAMPER AND SPENT THE NIGHT AND THEN WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE.
Jimmy: THAT'S ROMANTIC. ISN'T THAT ROMANTIC?
WELL, IT WAS TO US.
Jimmy: NO, I THINK IT'S GREAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: RV OR WHAT'S THE OTHER THING? AIRSTREAM.
I'VE NEVER HAD THE AIRSTREAM. I LOVE THE WAY THOSE LOOK, THOUGH. BUT WE LIKE TO DRIVE IN OURS, BECAUSE WE GOT THE LITTLE BATHROOM, IT'S KINDA HARD FOR ME TO STOP IN A SERVICE STATION TO PEE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU'RE IN THE STALL, AND THERE'S A PAPER UP UNDER -- CAN YOU JUST SIGN THIS FOR ME?
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU'RE LIKE -- WHO DO I MAKE IT OUT TO, WHO DO I MAKE IT OUT TOO MR. LOCHTE? YEAH ABSOLUTELY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT DO YOU -- DO YOU EVER STOP YOUR BRAIN, DO YOU EVER STOP WRITING AND WORKING? DO YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, I THINK OF IDEAS, AND I JUST GO MY WIFE SHE'S USED TO IT, BUT I JUST RECORD IT ON MY PHONE -- UH HUNGRY, HUNGRY HUMANS. [ LAUGHTER ] OR SOME IDEA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, I GO THIS COULD BE A A SONG. AND YOU JUST HUM A SONG?
I KNOW, AND THEN YOU WAKE UP AND IT'S A STUPID IDEA.
Jimmy: IT'S AWFUL. AND THEN YOU DO IT WITH GOLD MEDALISTS AND YOU MAKE IT ON THE "TONIGHT SHOW."
I USUALLY KEEP A NOTEPAD AND A TAPE RECORDER BY THE BED BECAUSE I DO WAKE UP. AND I'VE LEARNED YEARS AGO, THAT IF I DON'T WRITE IT DOWN, I WILL FORGET IT.
Jimmy: YOU DO?
YEAH, CAUSE I'LL THINK I'LL REMEMBER THAT I HAD A GREAT DREAM, AND I FORGET WHAT IT WAS.
Jimmy: WELL, YOU WROTE ALL THE SONGS ON "PURE AND SIMPLE"?
I DID. AND THESE ARE ALL LOVE SONGS. I CALL IT "LOVE OF MANY COLORS." SINCE I WAS MARRIED 50 YEARS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD YEAR TO WRITE LOVE SONGS. SO THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT COLORED, ABOUT EVERYTHING. EVERY KIND OF LOVE.
Jimmy: MY FAVORITE IS THE TITLE TRACK. I LIKE "PURE AND SIMPLE."
OH, THANK YOU, YEAH IT'S "PURE AND SIMPLE."
Jimmy: IT IS YEAH.
THAT'S THE NAME OF OUR TOUR, TOO, WE JUST TRAVEL WITH ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE, ITS JUST FOUR OF US ON STAGE. AND SO I THOUGHT --
Jimmy: HAVE YOU EVER DONE THAT?
NO, NOT SINCE THE EARLY DAYS. EARLY, EARLY, EARLY DAYS, BACK WHEN I WAS TRAVELING IN MY COVERED WAGON INSTEAD OF A TOUR BUS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DO SAY THERE'S THIS VERSION, BUT THEN BTHERE'S A A WAL-MART VERSION THAT HAS THIS AND, LIKE, A ALMOST LIKE GREATEST HITS --
IT IS. IT'S CALLED DOLLY'S GREATEST HITS.
Jimmy: IT'S A DOUBLE ALBUM.
YES, AND SO IT'S, THEN THERE'S A CRACKER BARREL VERSION. SEE, YOU WRITE THESE --
Jimmy: BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE AT ALL. IT'S PURE, BUT IT'S NOT SIMPLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
RIGHT?
Jimmy: SO IT SHOULD JUST BE CALLED DOLLY'S PURE. YEAH PURE DOLLY.
THEIR LOOKING FOR MONEY. THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY. IT COSTS A LOT TO LOOK THIS CHEAP. AND I NEED WAL-MART'S MONEY, SO THEY'VE GOT THAT ONE, AND I NEED CRACKER BARREL'S MONEY, AND I NEED SO. ANYWAY, WE DO HAVE THREE VERSIONS, WE GOT THE WAL-MART VERSION, WHICH IS THE HITS ALBUM, BUT ON THE CRACKER BARREL, WE HAVE TWO LIVE TRACKS FROM THE GLASTONBURY FESTIVAL. WE HAVE "JOLENE" AND "NINE TO FIVE," ON THAT ONE.
Jimmy: HEY BY THE WAY "JOLENE", I DON'T REMEMBER THAT AS BEING, LIKE, ONE OF THE BIGGEST HITS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, BUT I KNEW "NINE TO FIVE," "ISLANDS IN THE STREAM", AH, YOU KNOW, BIG DOLLY FAN, BUT THEN "COAT OF MANY COLORS," AND THEN "JOLENE," I THINK WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE EVERYONE JUST STARTED PLAYING IT AT BARS, AND I WAS, LIKE, WHAT IS JOLENE? EVERYONE DANCED. AND I CHECKED ON SPOTIFY TODAY, IT'S THE MOST SEARCHED FOR SONG THAT YOU HAVE.
AND IT'S THE MOST RECORDED SONG I'VE EVER WRITTEN. IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD GARAGE BAND SONG. EVERY BAND CAN PLAY IT EASY. AND IT'S SINGABLE, EASY TO LEARN. NOT A LOT OF INVOLVED WORDS IN THE VERSES, BUT THE CHORUS IS SO SINGABLE.
Jimmy: AS OPPOSED TO "COAT OF MANY COLORS", WHICH BY THE WAY I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE BIG NBC HIT, THE MOVIE "COAT OF MANY COLORS." CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
IT DID GREAT. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND I LOVED IT.

Jimmy: AND THEY JUST ANNOUNCED NOVEMBER 30th THAT YOU'RE DOING "CHRISTMAS COAT OF MANY COLORS."
YES, IT'S CALLED "A CHRISTMAS OF MANY COLORS, CIRCLE OF LOVE", AND IT'S REALLY POWERFUL LITTLE STORY, ALL TRUE STORIES FROM MY CHILDHOOD, AND SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT. I GET TO ACTUALLY PLAY A LITTLE PART IN THE MOVIE, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I PATTERNED MY LOOK AFTER THE TOWN TROLLUP, IN OUR TOWN, BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL EM'.
Jimmy: ME TOO. DID YOU REALLY?
YES. AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING. SHE HAD ALL THIS MAKEUP, AND HAIR, AND ALL THESE TIGHT CLOTHS, AND EVERYTHING I WANTED, SO IT IMPRESSED ME. SO I THOUGHT WELL WHY NOT, PLAY THE PAINTED LADY. THAT I PATTERNED MY LOOK AFTER. SO I DID HER IN THE MOVIE. YEAH SO --
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT. SHE MUST BE SO HONORED THAT YOU DID THAT.
WELL, SHE DIDN'T, I DIDN'T I NEVER CALLED HER NAME. I NEVER REALLY GOT TO KNOW HER REALLY, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HER FAMILY PROBABLY KNEW SHE WAS A HOE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT TRACK IS NOT ON ANY OF THE ALBUMS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT TRACK ISN'T ON THE CRACKER BARREL OR THE WAL-MART VERSION, BUT THAT'S THE ONE YOU WANT TO HEAR. IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO HER DOLLY SING THAT, THAT'S A GOOD ONE. HER FAMILY NEVER KNEW SHE WAS A A HOE BY DOLLY PARTON. [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THE ONLY HOES WE KNEW BACK THEN, WERE THE HOES WE USE TO CHOP TOBACCO.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE, YEAH.
SO ANYWAY, THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE CALLED HER. SHE WAS PRECIOUS. SHE MEANT A LOT TO ME.
Jimmy: WELL I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR CAMEO, AND I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR YOU SING TONIGHT. YOU'RE GOING TO SING THE TITLE TRACK?
I'M GOING TO SING "PURE AND SIMPLE." ALSO CAN I JUST MENTION, THERE'S A CHILDREN'S BOOK "COAT OF MANY COLORS", COMING OUT OCTOBER 18th, WHILE WERE TALKING ABOUT "COAT OF MANY COLORS."
