[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- MICKEY ROURKE, ROB RIGGLE, MUSICAL GUEST KINGS OF LEON, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: NA-NEW-NA-NEW!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE'S YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT SHOW. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I SAW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WENT TO THE BEACH YESTERDAY WHILE HE'S VACATIONING ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD. WHICH GOT WEIRD WHEN HE TOOK OUT HIS METAL DETECTOR TO SEARCH FOR $16 TRILLION IN QUARTERS. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S LIKE, "HEY LOOK. OH. OH, JUST A BOTTLE CAP, DAMN IT." A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WENT TO THE BEACH YESTERDAY WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD. YOU KNOW, TIMES ARE TOUGH FOR OBAMA BECAUSE EVEN THE SHARKS WERE LIKE, "I'M NOT GOING NEAR THAT GUY." I MEAN, IT'S JUST BAD. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I THINK OBAMA UNDERSTANDS PEOPLE'S CONCERNS. AFTER SPENDING THE DAY AT THE BEACH, HE SAID, "THIS HAS BEEN FUN BUT I SHOULD REALLY GET BACK TO THE GOLF COURSE BECAUSE PRIORITIES ARE PRIORITIES." [ LAUGHTER ] ALSO, DURING A FUND-RAISER LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA SUGGESTED THAT ONE OR MORE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES MAY RETIRE SOON. WHICH GOT AWKWARD WHEN RUTH BADER GINSBURG SAID, "YOU CAN HAVE THIS GAVEL WHEN YOU PRY IT OUT OF MY EVEN COLDER, DEADER FINGERS." WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO, THAT'S -- BUT THIS IS INTERESTING. POLITICAL EXPERTS SAY THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS TRYING TO DISTANCE HERSELF FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA AS SHE GEARS UP FOR 2016. YOU KNOW, I THINK SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO DISTANCE HERSELF FROM OBAMA FOR A WHILE. CHECK OUT THIS INTERVIEW THAT --
YOU KNOW, HER DISCIPLINE, HER STAMINA, HER THOUGHTFULNESS, HER ABILITY TO PROJECT, I THINK MADE HER AN EXTRAORDINARY TALENT. SHE ALSO WAS ALL READY A WORLD FIGURE. [ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: BUT THIS IS TRUE. IT'S RUMORED THAT HILLARY IS TRYING TO DISTANCE HERSELF FROM OBAMA. LET'S JUST SEE HOW DIFFERENT THEY ARE IN TONIGHT'S "TALE OF THE TAPE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
TALE OF THE TAPE. HILLARY VERSUS OBAMA.
Jimmy: FIRST UP, THERE IS "HOMETOWN." FOR HILLARY, WE HAVE LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS. FOR OBAMA, WE HAVE LET'S JUST SAY HAWAII. [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT UP, THERE'S "HEIGHT." FOR HILLARY, IT'S 5'7." FOR OBAMA, IT'S 2009. [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT CATEGORY IS "USED TO BE." HILLARY USED TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. OBAMA USED TO BE HAPPY. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY INTERESTING. AFTER THAT, THERE'S "BIGGEST INSPIRATION." HILLARY'S IS JOHN F. KENNEDY. OBAMA'S IS THAT GUY IN THE CORONA COMMERCIAL WHO GETS AN IMPORTANT CALL AND THROWS THE PHONE INTO THE OCEAN. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, WE HAVE "PERSONAL MOTTO." HILLARY'S IS "2016 CAN'T GET HERE FAST ENOUGH." OBAMA'S IS "DITTO." SO I GUESS THAT MAYBE THEY'RE NOT THAT DIFFERENT AFTER ALL. THEY'RE KIND OF THE SAME. [ APPLAUSE ] GUYS, HERE'S AN UPDATE ON OUR PAL, TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IN A NEW INTERVIEW, FORD SAID THAT HE IS STILL SOBER, AND HE'LL NEVER BE CAUGHT DOING ANYTHING ILLEGAL EVER AGAIN. THEN HE SAID, "UNLESS SOMEONE'S TAPING ME, THEN I'LL PROBABLY GET CAUGHT." ROB FORD ALSO SAID THAT HE IS COMMITTED TO LIVING A HEALTHIER LIFE AND HIS DAYS OF GOING TO THE LIQUOR STORE ARE OVER. WHICH WOULD BE GREAT IF HE WEREN'T ADDICTED TO CRACK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT -- "NO MORE CHOCOLATE. NO MORE SODAS FOR ME. NO MORE CHOCOLATE." YOU'RE SMOKING CRACK IN YOUR SISTER'S BASEMENT. WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT YOU HAVING A BEER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] A LITTLE CONTROVERSY HERE. ON LAST NIGHT'S EPISODE OF "BACHELOR IN PARADISE," IT WAS REVEALED ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS, MICHELLE K., LEFT THE SHOW BECAUSE SHE HAD GOTTEN INVOLVED WITH ONE OF THE SHOW'S PRODUCERS. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] OTHER CONTESTANTS WERE JUST AS SHOCKED AS YOU WERE. THEY WERE LIKE, "SOMEONE FROM THIS SHOW IS IN A REAL RELATIONSHIP? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S GOING ON?" AND DID YOU SEE THIS? LAST NIGHT, TWO CONTESTANTS WERE SPENDING TIME TOGETHER AND ONE OF THEM HAD A PRETTY POWERFUL REALIZATION. LISTEN TO THIS.
I'M A PISCES. SO PISCES ARE LIKE FISH. THAT'S WHY I LOVE THE WATER. AND PISCES ARE VERY, LIKE, FLEXIBLE. AND MY SISTER IS ST. PATRICK'S DAY, MARCH --
EVERY DAY THAT I HANG OUT WITH ASHLEE, I'M LOSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET OTHER PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WORST PART ABOUT THAT IS THAT SHE IS STILL TALKING. MY LUCKY NUMBER IS SEVEN BECAUSE WHEN I WAS SEVEN, I STEPPED ON A PIECE OF GUM THAT LOOKED LIKE THE NUMBER SEVEN. AND THEN, I WAS SCRAPPING IT OFF AND IT TOOK SEVEN HOURS TO SCRAPE IT OFF. AND THEN I TOOK THE SCRAPPED OUT GUM, AND I PUT IN THE GARBAGE, AND THERE WAS A A $20 BILL SO I BECAME $20 RICHER. AND THEN -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHUT UP! HEY, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO STOLE A BRIEFCASE WITH $4,000 WORTH OF CASH FROM KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING, "WHAT'S KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN DOING WITH A BRIEFCASE FULL OF CASH?" AND I'M WONDERING, WHAT IS SHE DOING WITH A BRIEFCASE? [ LAUGHTER ] WHY NOT PUT IT IN A PURSE? YEAH. SHE WORK AT A LAW FIRM? YEAH. $4,000 IN A BRIEFCASE. DID SOMEBODY KIDNAP BRUCE JENNER?
Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: $4,000 IN UNMARKED BILLS. OR THE OLD LADY GETS IT.
Steve: HEY, I'M NOT LADY! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, I SAW THAT TACO BELL OPENED A NEW HIGH-END RESTAURANT THIS WEEK THAT SELLS $10 TACOS. THAT'S WEIRD. USUALLY YOU PAY A HIGH PRICE AFTER YOU EAT TACO BELL. [ LAUGHTER ] OY, CHALUPA! WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: HEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT IS FORMER KISS GUITARIST AND ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAMER ACE FREHLEY SITTING IN WITH THE ROOTS TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE THE BEST, BUDDY.

TIGER WOODS AND RORY McILROY WILL BE HERE ON MONDAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CAN'T WAIT.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: BUT FIRST, WE'VE GOT A FUN SHOW TONIGHT. FROM "FRANK MILLER'S SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR," THE ONE AND ONLY MICKEY ROURKE IS HERE TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S A ROCK STAR. HE'S A ROCK STAR.
Steve: HE IS.
Jimmy: HE'S JUST THE COOLEST DUDE EVER. I LOVE THAT GUY. PLUS, FROM "LET'S BE COPS," THE VERY FUNNY ROB RIGGLE IS STOPPING BY.
Steve: OH! LOVE ME SOME ROB RIGGLE.
Jimmy: AND WE'VE GOT GREAT MUSIC. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS OUT THERE. I LOVE THESE GUYS. I LIKE EVERYONE IN THE BAND. I LIKE THEIR SOUND. KINGS OF LEON ARE HERE.
Steve: YES!
Jimmy: "MECHANICAL BULL"! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THE SHOW -- WE, LIKE ALL OF YOU, WERE SHAKEN UP A BIT LAST NIGHT -- WHEN WE LEARNED THAT GENIUS COMEDIAN AND ACTOR ROBIN WILLIAMS PASSED AWAY. HE WAS ONE OF A KIND. HE WAS ONE IN A MILLION. HE'S LIKE UNBELIEVABLE. IF YOU EVER SAW THIS GUY'S STAND-UP, YOU WOULDN'T EVEN -- IF YOU DON'T KNOW STAND-UP, YOU SHOULD YOUTUBE RIGHT NOW AND JUST WATCH IT. HE'S JUST AMAZING. HE WAS -- HE WAS FUNNY, AND HE WAS FAST. AND HE WOULD WEAVE IN AND OUT OF CHARACTERS. HE WOULD GET SHAKESPEARIAN. HE WOULD JUST GET INTO LIKE -- [ IMPERSONATING ROBIN WILLIAMS ] "OH, YES. THANK YOU. TELL THE GUYS AT YOUR HOME GOING. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON THERE? YES. THEN THERE'S A KID GOING -- NOT THE LEG! YES AND LIKE, MARTHA, GRAB MY BALL AND CHAIN AND KICK -- YES, THANK YOU." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND YOU'D WATCH HIM! AND YOU'D WATCH HIM AND YOU WOULD CRY LAUGHING. AND YOU WOULD THINK I'M NEVER GOING TO SEE ANYONE LIKE THIS HUMAN EVER. IT'S JUST AMAZING. HIS BRAIN WAS ALWAYS THINKING TEN STEPS AHEAD OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING. HE WAS LIKE THE MUHAMMAD ALI OF COMEDY. FOR A TASTE OF THE DIVINE MADNESS OF ROBIN WILLIAMS, HERE'S A CLIP OF ROBIN'S FIRST EVER "TONIGHT SHOW" APPEARANCE WITH JOHNNY CARSON.
WHAT YOU UP TO? A MAN WHO KNOW HIMSELF BUT JUST NOT TOUCH HIMSELF. [ LAUGHTER ]
