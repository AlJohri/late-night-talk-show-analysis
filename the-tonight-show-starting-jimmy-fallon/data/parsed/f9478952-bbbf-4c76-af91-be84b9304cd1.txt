HERE IN NEW YORK, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SHOWED UP AT JFK AIRPORT OVER THE WEEKEND TO PROTEST TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION BAN. PEOPLE WHO WERE ACTUALLY AT THE PROTEST SAID, "THIS IS AWFUL." WHILE THE PEOPLE OUT IN LaGUARDIA WERE LIKE, "YOU THINK YOU GOT IT BAD? WE'RE AT LaGUARDIA." [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S BAD.

HE DOESN'T KNOW WHEN SOMEONE IS FAKING IT." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: OH! HEY, HO! HEY! ♪♪
Jimmy: AND WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON YESTERDAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE, TRUMP HOSTED A A SCREENING OF THE MOVIE "FINDING DORY." [ LAUGHTER ] TRUMP SAID THAT HE ACTUALLY RELATED MORE TO "FINDING NEMO" BECAUSE THAT WAS ABOUT AN ORANGE AND WHITE CARTOON. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHY WOULD YOU -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU -- LAST WEEK DONALD TRUMP HELD A A PRESS CONFERENCE WITH BRITISH PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY, AND IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE PRETTY FOCUSED ON ONE THING. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WE HAVE A REALLY, I THINK, A A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP.
WE HAVE ALREADY STRUCK UP A A GOOD, GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EL CHAPO WAS EXCITED TO WATCH IT, THEN A 30-SECOND AD POPPED UP AND HE WAS LIKE, "AH, FORGET IT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I CAN'T, I CAN'T. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS." I SAW THAT TOSTITOS IS COMING OUT WITH A LIMITED EDITION BAG THAT ACTUALLY DOUBLES AS BREATHALYZER. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

LOOK PEOPLE, I MADE MY POSITION ON IMMIGRATION VERY CLEAR. WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRANTS, YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES. EITHER GET OUT OF HERE, OR MARRY ME. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE IMMIGRATION BAN THAT FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT ALL OF MY DECISION-MAKING SO FAR HAS BEEN ERRATIC AND RANDOM AND QUOTE, "LIKE A TODDLER THROWING A A TANTRUM AT A McDONALD'S BALL PIT." [ LAUGHTER ] FAKE NEWS. [ LAUGHTER ] I ASSURE YOU, MY DECISIONS ARE ANYTHING BUT RANDOM. TAKE MY CABINET, FOR EXAMPLE. PEOPLE SAY I ONLY PICK MILLIONAIRES AND WALL STREET INSIDERS. BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE. I HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC SELECTIONS PROCESS. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS MY GOLDEN NOMINATION CAGE, AND I SPIN IT EXACTLY THREE TIMES. AND THEN I REACH IN AND PULL OUT A BALL WITH MY FREAKISHLY LARGE HANDS. [ LAUGHTER ] MY HANDS ARE SO LARGE THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE GLOVES IN MY SIZE. [ LAUGHTER ] IMAGINE HOW HARD IT IS TO USE VENDING MACHINES. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T WANT A SNICKERS. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANTED DORITOS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] COOL RANCH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I REACH IN WITH MY GIANT HANDS AND IF THE BALL'S WHITE I NOMINATE A WALL STREET INSIDER. IF THE BALL IS BLACK, I NOMINATE BEN CARSON. [ LAUGHTER ] SORRY, BEN. SEE? SCIENCE. NEXTLY. [ LAUGHTER ] TWO OR THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CRITICIZING MY EXECUTIVE ORDERS. THEY SAY THEY'RE DANGEROUS AND CRAZY AND QUOTE, "ALMOST AS THOUGH HE'S SPINNING A GIANT WHEEL AND DOING WHATEVER IT LANDS ON." [ LAUGHTER ] FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SAY THAT, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU TOTALLY GET IT. THERE'S A PROCESS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHATEVER I NEED TO MAKE AN EXECUTIVE DECISION I SIMPLY GIVE MY HUGE WHEEL OF DECISION A BIG SPIN, A REALLY BIG SPIN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SURE, REPEALING OBAMACARE ISN'T GREAT, BUT HEY, AT LEAST IT DIDN'T LAND ON "NUKE THE MOON JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS." [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK HOW CLOSE IT CAME.

Jimmy: YOU LOOK GREAT, BY THE WAY.
I LOOK GREAT?
Jimmy: YEAH.
IS THAT SARCASM
Jimmy: NO, IT WASN'T. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
YOU SEE, THIS IS THE THING WITH YOU. IT'S A TALK SHOW, "OH, YOU LOOK GREAT," EVEN THOUGH, LOOK AT ME. OF COURSE I DON'T LOOK GREAT. LOOK! I'M WORSE THAN LAST -- THE LAST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT GETTING OLD, AND LOSING THE HAIR AND DISTENDED TESTICLES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND NOW IT'S 6 MONTHS LATER. SO NOW -- NOW, IT IS WORSE BECAUSE I'M GETTING FAT AGAIN. WHICH IS -- NO, BECAUSE -- LISTEN, RIGHT. I KNOW IT'S NOT -- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE ME ON ONE OF THOSE DOCUMENTARIES YET, BUT IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE.
Jimmy: RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN -- IT, NO -- IT STARTS SOMEWHERE. BECAUSE I GOT FIT. I GOT FAT FIRST, ABOUT 15 YEARS, AT ABOUT 30 TO, LIKE, 45, AND THEN I GOT -- AND I STARTED TO GOT FIT, ALRIGHT, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE UP ANY FOOD OR DRINK. THAT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION. SO I WORKED OUT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT NOW, BECAUSE I'M OLD, AND WEAK, AND MY BONES HURT, I CAN'T, I CAN'T WORK OUT ENOUGH TO BURN OFF THE CALORIES I TAKE IN AT NIGHT. SO I'M STILL EATING AND DRINKING TOO MUCH, BUT NOW I CAN'T WORK OUT LIKE "ROCKY" SO I'VE PUT ABOUT 10 POUNDS BACK ON. IT STARTS SOMEWHERE. YOU SEE, THIS THE PROBLEM IS, YOU THINK, "OH, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT." BUT THEN YOU -- BUT WHEN YOU SEE -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NO, LISTEN. BUT, LISTEN. YOU SEE -- YOU SEE THOSE GUYS ON DOCUMENTARIES. AND THEY'RE, LIKE, 700 POUNDS AND I'M THINKING, BUT WHEN THEY GOT TO 300 POUNDS, DIDN'T THEY GO, "OH, THIS IS A BIT MUCH." YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT -- HOW IS IT -- IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO BECOME 700 POUNDS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HAVE TO WORK AT IT EVERY DAY. SO WHEN THERE WAS -- WEIGHING THEMSELVES AND THEY HAVE TO GET THEIR NEIGHBOR IN TO TELL THEM WHAT THE SCALE SAYS, WASN'T THAT A CLUE? IF YOU CAN'T -- I MEAN, MY PENIS IS SMALL BUT I CAN STILL SEE IT, BUT -- BUT WHEN YOU CAN'T -- WHAT I'M SAYING IS -- [ LAUGHTER ] I -- I OWN IT. I'M -- I'M PUTTING ON WEIGHT AGAIN BECAUSE I'M EATING TOO MUCH. I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT MAKES EXCUSES. THAT SAYS, "NO, IT'S GRANDEUR." IT'S NEVER GRANDEUR.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
RIGHT?
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT'S BIG BONES. YOU HAVE BIG BONES COVERED IN MEAT AND GRAVY. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT GETS PEOPLE FAT.
Jimmy: MAYBE JUST HAVE LESS CALORIES OR STOP EATING AND DRINKING?
NO, I'M NOT GOING STOP EATING AND DRINKING. NOW WHAT'S THE POINT? WHAT'S THE POINT IN LIVING LONGER IF YOU'RE SOBER? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ESPECIALLY -- ESPECIALLY THESE DAYS. I WANT TO BE DRUNK ALL THE TIME! [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST WANT TO BE DRUNK ALL THE TIME, AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO END BECAUSE I'M JUST GOING TO GET BIGGER AND BIGGER, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT, REALLY. BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP EATING AND DRINKING BECAUSE THERE IS NO POINT. AND I CAN'T WORK OUT. BECAUSE I'M JUST --
Jimmy: MAYBE, CAN YOU DRINK A LESS CALORIC BEVERAGE OR DON'T DRINK OR -- DRINK SOME DIET --
NO. I -- I JUST -- I JUST LIKE THE TASTE. IT'S AS IF YOU WERE TO SAY, "OH, YOU, LIKE, DRINK TOO MUCH. YOU SHOULD GIVE IT UP." THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I LIKE IT TOO MUCH. I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP SO LET'S FIND ANOTHER METHOD. BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE -- I WOULDN'T HAVE THESE STIFLING STEAKS IN YOUR STOMACH. I CAN'T DO IT -- I DON'T WANT TO CHEAT, BUT -- THERE WAS A WOMAN, RIGHT, IN ENGLAND, RIGHT? HONESTLY. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE WAS A -- THERE WAS A -- THERE WAS A WOMAN IN ENGLAND. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. IT WAS IN THE PAPER, RIGHT. SHE WAS 600 POUNDS, RIGHT? AND SHE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING AND SHE -- SO THEY JUST -- SHE HAD 10 BURGER AND FRIES A A DAY? ALRIGHT? SHE USED TO GET A CAB, A TAXI, TO THE McDONALD'S, RIGHT? TO HAVE THESE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SHE DIDN'T EVEN WALK. THAT WOULD HAVE BURN UP A FEW CALORIES. RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT? AND SO -- THEY LOOKED AS THOUGH WE HAVE -- WHICH, YOU KNOW, YOU DO FEEL SORRY FOR THEM, BUT -- SO THEY WIRED HER JAW TOGETHER TO TRY AND STOP HER EATING. SO SHE LIQUIDIZED 10 BURGER AND FRIES A DAY. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] SO SHE HAD A McDONALD'S SMOOTHIE EVERY DAY. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE! IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN'T DO.
Jimmy: NO, YOU --
YEAH.
Jimmy: I REALLY WANT TO GET TO TALKING ABOUT THIS NETFLIX MOVIE THAT YOU HAVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY. THIS IS TRUE AS WELL. RIGHT? THIS IS HOW MAD -- THIS IS HOW MAD THE WORLD GOT. A FEW MONTHS AGO, THERE WAS A -- THERE WAS A SCHOOL IN LONDON, THAT WANTED TO BAN THE WORD "OBESE." [ LAUGHTER ] BAN THE WORD "OBESE!" [ APPLAUSE ] NO. THAT'S TRUE. THEY SAID -- THEY SAID -- THEY SAID THEY WANTED TO BAN THE WORD "OBESE."
Jimmy: WHY?
BECAUSE IT WAS OFFENSIVE TO -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DESCRIBE THEM. TO KIDS THAT WERE AS WIDE AS THEY ARE TALL. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN -- NO. BUT, THE "OBESE" WAS THE POLITE WORD. THAT WAS THE POLITE WORD THEY INVENTED SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY FAT LITTLE [ BLEEP ]. [ SCREAMS AND APPLAUSE ] NO, BUT -- IF THEY -- SO -- SO DON'T -- DON'T BAN THE WORD. GO FOR A RUN. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

Jimmy: AH.
DOPEY TUNES, AND IT'S -- AND IT'S TRAGIC, BUT IT'S REALLY FUNNY. AND IT'S SO SORT OF NOW WHERE EVERYONE WANTS TO BE FAMOUS AND THEY JUST THINK THEY CAN, YOU KNOW, GET OUT THERE AND DO IT.

Jimmy: BUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SONG TITLES? WHAT'S THE CHRISTMAS -- THE HOLIDAY ONE?
OH, UM, "DON'T CRY, IT'S CHRISTMAS." [ LAUGHTER ] "PLEASE, DON'T MAKE FUN OF THE DISABLED."
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD ONE. THAT'S A --
"NATIVE AMERICAN." AND HE THINKS HE'S -- HE THINKS HE'S DOING GOOD, AND HE'S ACCIDENTALLY OFFENSIVE. YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
HE THINKS THAT THESE SONGS ARE GOING TO BE ANTHEMS AND HE JUST GETS IT ALL WRONG. SO IT'S REALLY CRINGEY.
Jimmy: BUT, BEFORE WERE YOU A COMEDIAN YOU WERE ACTUALLY A A MUSICIAN. SO --
YEAH.
Jimmy: IS THIS LOOSELY BASED ON SOME THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
WELL, YOU USE EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW ALL YOUR EXPERIENCES. I WORKED IN AN OFFICE FOR TEN YEARS AND WROTE ABOUT IT. AND BEFORE THAT I TRIED TO BE A A ROCK STAR AND FAILED MISERABLY. BUT YEAH, YOU USE ALL THAT. YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: YEAH.
I REMEMBER, ONE GIG WE DID, ABOUT 1985, WE PAID -- PAID A A PUB, RIGHT? AND WE DID THE SOUND CHECK. AND THE GUY CAME OVER. AND THIS IS SORT OF IN THE FILM. THE GUY CAME OVER, THE ENGINEER, SAID, "OH, YOU MIGHT AS WELL STAY UP, LADS, YOU'RE ON NOW." AND, I SAID, "WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO OPEN THE DOORS TO LET THE CROWD IN." HE SAID, "THEY'RE OPEN." [ LAUGHTER ] HE SAID, "NO ONE'S COME TO SEE YOU." NO ONE.
Jimmy: NOT ONE PERSON.
NOT ONE PERSON, RIGHT? AND THE BAND WAS SORT OF CRESTFALLEN. AND I TRIED TO BE POSITIVE. I SAID TO THE BAND, "LET'S JUST TREAT IT LIKE A FREE REHEARSAL." A FREE REHEARSAL. WE JUST PLAYED EIGHT SONGS TO NO ONE.
Jimmy: GOSH.
I MEAN IT WAS REALLY WEIRD -- IT WAS LIKE AN ART. IT WAS LIKE ZEN. WE JUST, WE JUST.

Jimmy: BECAUSE THEY -- ALL DJs NOW THEY COME UP, LIKE KIND OF CATCHY, KIND OF CUTESY NAMES, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO I THOUGHT -- LIKE A REAL LAME ONE WOULD BE, LIKE, "DJ DAVE SUPREME."
DAVE SUPREME'S GOOD. IF YOU BOOK THAT --
Jimmy: DAVE SUPREME.
DAVE SUPREME YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
