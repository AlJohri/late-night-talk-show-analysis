Steve: A ZUNE.
Jimmy: A ZUNE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU FOR WATCHING "THE TONIGHT SHOW." HERE'S WHAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT. YOU GUYS BOTH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH WERE INTERVIEWED ON "FACE THE NATION" OVER THE WEEKEND. IT WAS A BIG SHOW FOR THOSE GUYS. DURING HIS INTERVIEW PRESIDENT BUSH SAID THERE'S ACTUALLY A A 50% CHANCE HIS BROTHER JEB WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016. THEN HE SAID BUT THERE'S AN 80% CHANCE THAT HE WON'T. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUSH ALSO TOOK TIME TO SHARE SOME CHILDHOOD MEMORIES OF GROWING UP WITH HIS FATHER, GEORGE H.W. BUSH. CHECK OUT THIS CUTE STORY ABOUT WHEN THEIR DAD MOVED THEIR FAMILY TO A SMALL TOWN IN TEXAS.
HE GOES DOWN THERE AND FINDS A DUPLEX FOR MOTHER AND ME AND HIMSELF. AND HAD INDOOR PLUMBING. ONE OF THE FEW INDOOR BATHROOMS IN ODESSA. AND WE SHARED THE BATHROOM WITH TWO HOOKERS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: THIS IS FAMILY SHOW.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS KIND OF A BIG DEAL IT WAS ACTUALLY THE 60th ANNIVERSARY OF "FACE THE NATION." AND DURING HIS INTERVIEW PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT OUR COUNTRY DOESN'T, QUOTE, "FEAR THE FUTURE, WE GRAB IT." YEAH.
