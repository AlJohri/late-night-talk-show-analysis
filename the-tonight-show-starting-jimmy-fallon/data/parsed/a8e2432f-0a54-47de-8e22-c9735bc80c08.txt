HEY, GUYS, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE TWINS, BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU GUYS ARE WONDERING. HERE'S A LITTLE KNOWN FACT ABOUT US. OUR FATHER WENT TO PRISON FOR LIKE 20 YEARS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID.
NOPE.
WE DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT IN ORDER TO GET 20 YEARS IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, YOU CAN DO ONE OF FOUR THINGS. YOU CAN COMMIT FIRST-DEGREE MURDER, SECOND-DEGREE MURDER, CHILD MOLESTATION OR TAX EVASION. SO WE IMMEDIATELY GOT RID OF TAX EVASION, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS BROKE ALL THE TIME. THAT LEFT WITH US THREE CHOICES. ALL PRETTY TERRIBLE. BUT I FEEL LIKE THIS MIGHT BE THE ONLY SITUATION WHERE YOU KIND OF HOPE YOUR FATHER'S A A MURDERER. [ LAUGHTER ]
ABSOLUTELY. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE.
ONCE OUR FATHER LEFT US, WE NEEDED SOMETHING TO FILL THE VOID SO WE DID WHAT ANY YOUNG BLACK DUDE WOULD DO IN THAT SITUATION. WE TURNED TO "SPACE JAM." [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH.
IT'S THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT IS. IT IS. SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S THE "CITIZEN KANE" OF MICHAEL JORDAN MOVIES. [ LAUGHTER ] WE TOTALLY AGREE.
ABSOLUTELY.
BUT WHENEVER YOU WATCH SOMETHING TOO MANY TIMES, YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. LIKE ONE QUESTION WE HAVE IS, HOW DID MICHAEL JORDAN CONVINCE CHARLES BARKLEY TO BE IN THAT MOVIE? [ LAUGHTER ] NOBODY KNOWS. WE SPENT THE LAST DECADE TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. AND I THINK WE DID. SO TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO RE-ENACT THE PHONE CALL THAT MICHAEL JORDAN AND CHARLES BARKLEY HAD WITH ONE ANOTHER ON NOVEMBER 13th, 1995.
YEP.
KENNY'S GOING TO PLAY MICHAEL JORDAN AND BY DEFAULT I'M CHARLES BARKLEY. [ LAUGHTER ] RING, RING, RING.
WHAT'S UP, MAN? WHO'S THIS? WHO'S THIS?
IT'S ME MAN. IT'S MICHAEL JORDAN. WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH, WHAT'S UP, MICHAEL? HOW ARE YOU DOING? HOW IS BASEBALL DOING, BROTHER? [ LAUGHTER ] BASEBALL? HOW'S BASEBALL.
NO, I HEARD THE QUESTION, MAN. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT BASEBALL, MAN. I'M WORKING ON THIS MOVIE AND I WANT YOU TO BE IN IT, MAN.
OH SNAP. YOU'RE GETTING INTO MOVIES, MIKE?
