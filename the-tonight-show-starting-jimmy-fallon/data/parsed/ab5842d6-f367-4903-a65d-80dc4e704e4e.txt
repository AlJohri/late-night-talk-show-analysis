20 MINUTES IN THE MORNING, PREFERABLY NAKED.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND SO HE SAID, I DON'T WAKE UP --
YOUR H.O.A. MAY HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THAT. SO CHECK WITH YOUR NEIGHBORS.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. YEAH, YOUR NEIGHBORS MIGHT BE BOTHERED, EXACTLY. BUT -- BUT HE STARTED DOING IT --
YEAH.
AND THEN HE JUST, STARTED FEELING BETTER ABOUT HIMSELF, AND EATING BETTER.
ONE SMALL CHANGE AT A TIME, COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED HIM. WE DID THE INTERVIEW IN HIS BARREL SAUNA.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE BEST.
AND IT WENT BETWEEN THAT AND ICE BATHS. WHICH WAS AN ODD PATTERN IN THE BOOK. A LOT OF PEOPLE USE COLD EXPOSURE FOR IMPROVING MOOD AND PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT.
Jimmy: REALLY?
LAIRD HAMILTON, KING OF BIG WAVE SURFING.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY LAIRD HAMILTON, YEAH. HE DID THAT.
AND WIM HOF, DITTO. SAME THING AND --
Jimmy: BUT YOU DID THE INTERVIEW, IN THE PODCAST, YOU'RE IN THE SAUNA, AT ONE POINT YOUR MIC MELTS? OR SHORTS OUT OR SOMETHING? 'CAUSE IT'S SO HOT.
I CHECKED ALL THE EQUIPMENT, TO MAKE SURE IT WOULDN'T MELT. I DID ALL OF THIS HOMEWORK, AND FORGET ABOUT ONE THING, WHICH WAS THE HANDLES ON THE MICS. AND SO, WE HAD TO WRAP THEM IN TOWELS BECAUSE IT GOT SO HOT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND RICK WAS LIKE, "WELL, THAT'S WHY THEY CALL THIS THE TRUTH BARREL." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I'LL BET IT'S THE TRUTH BARREL, YEAH. BUT I MEAN, YOU HAVE -- YOU HAVE TONY ROBBINS, YOU INTERVIEW SETH ROGEN. IT'S FUNNY PEOPLE -- NOW IT'S ENTERTAINERS AS WELL AS LIKE, JUST --
NAVY SEALs, GENERALS, CHESS PRODIGIES.
Jimmy: AND YOU READ IT -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ IT IN ORDER?
NO. IT'S LIKE A "CHOOSE-YOUR-OWN ADVENTURE" BOOK. SO YOU CAN DIP IN, AND DIP OUT. AND THE GOAL IS TO SIT WITH A A CUP OF COFFEE, OR TEA, OR WHATEVER, AND YOU CAN FIND A A TACTIC, MORNING ROUTINE, WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TEST YOURSELF AND SEE IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK FROM, SOME TYPE OF RESULTS FROM. AND IT'S REALLY A NOTEBOOK FOR MYSELF, THAT I CREATED AND THEN WHEN I WAS ABOUT HALF THROUGH PUTTING IT TOGETHER, I REALIZED, YOU KNOW, I SHOULD PROBABLY JUST PUBLISH THIS, BECAUSE IT'S -- SIZEABLE.
Jimmy: OTHER PEOPLE WOULD REALLY LIKE THIS. YOU GOT ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER TO DO THE FORWARD.
I DID.
Jimmy: WHICH IS AMAZING.
AND IT'S A VERY SURPRISING FORWARD, BECAUSE THE THEME IS "I AM NOT A SELF-MADE MAN," AND WHY HE HAS LEANED ON OTHER PEOPLE, AND HOW HE'S USED HELP AND ADVICE. AND ARNOLD'S FASCINATING, BECAUSE HE'S RE-INVENTED HIMSELF SUCCESSFULLY SO MANY TIMES. VERY FEW PEOPLE REALIZE HE WAS A MILLIONAIRE IN REAL ESTATE BEFORE HE EVER HAD HIS MOVIE BREAKTHROUGH.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH, HE'S A VERY SMART GUY. MOST PROFITABLE FILM: "TWINS", BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE STRUCTURED THE DEAL. AND HE PLAYS CHESS -- 1,000 PLUS TIMES A YEAR, AND KEEPS TRACK OF ALL OF THE TALLIES IN HIS HEAD. I MEAN, THIS IS A VERY FASCINATING GUY.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS THE ONE THING YOU THINK THAT A -- A A MAJORITY OF THE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE DO THAT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW? I MEAN --
I THINK NUMBER ONE, 80-PLUS PERCENT HAVE SOME TYPE OF MIND TRAINING, OR SOME TYPE OF CONDITIONING EXERCISE THAT THEY USE TO BECOME LESS REACTIVE. SO THEY CAN OPERATE IN HIGH STRESS ENVIRONMENTS. SO THAT CAN BE MEDITATION, FOR INSTANCE, WOULD BE ONE TYPE. THEY COULD USE LISTENING TO MUSIC, A SINGLE TRACK OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR FOCUS. THAT CAME UP, PROBABLY A DOZEN TIMES.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH, LISTENING TO THE SAME MUSIC OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR PRODUCTIVITY. BUT THE --
Jimmy: LIKE CLASSICAL MUSIC, OR IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT?
IT DEPENDS ON THE PERSON. SOME PEOPLE -- ATHLETES, A FEW ATHLETES LISTEN TO "THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS" SOUNDTRACK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SOME PEOPLE LISTEN TO HIP-HOP, OTHER PEOPLE LISTEN TO WHAT ARE CALLED AMBITONES, WHICH IS JUST LIKE -- BOOOOO.
Jimmy: NO WAY.
I CAN'T DO THAT ONE. BUT -- AND WHAT'S NICE ABOUT IT, IS THAT YOU FIND SAY, A A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT WAKE UP AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING. I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT. THAT'S NOT MY -- THAT'S NOT MY JAM.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST NOT GONNA -- NO.
BUT THEN YOU FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE BARELY HUMAN UNTIL 11:00 A.M., AND I'M LIKE, "THAT'S MY GUY." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO FIND, YOU CAN -- YOU CAN CHOOSE THESE BITS AND PIECES. BUT THE MINDFULNESS PRACTICE WAS A BIG ONE. OPTIMIZING SLEEP WAS ANOTHER BIG ONE. SO RICK RUBIN, YOU MENTIONED, HE USES THIS DEVICE CALLED THE CHILIPAD, WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO COOL OR HEAT THE SURFACE OF YOUR BED TO AN EXACT TEMPERATURE BETWEEN 55 AND ABOUT 110. AND REVOLUTIONIZES SLEEP FOR A A REALLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE, MYSELF INCLUDED.
Jimmy: THE THING I LOVE ABOUT YOU, TIM FERRISS -- BY THE WAY, TWO Rs, TWO Ss, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE PODCASTING THING. BUT YOU TRY ALL THIS STUFF.
I DO.
Jimmy: AND THAT'S WHAT I LOVE. WHETHER IT BE A DIET, OR A A MEDITATION OR -- IS IT MACRODOSING OR?
OH, IF YOU CAN DO MACRODOSING, THAT WOULD BE BIG. MICRODOSING OF PSYCHEDELICS -- DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.
Jimmy: OH, SORRY. MICRODOSING. YEAH, SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND JUST TO BE --
Jimmy: SORRY, GUYS. WE HAVE FANS OF ALL AGES, YEAH.
OH, NO, I GOT IT. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR TO MY FRIENDS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, THIS WAS ACTUALLY MY -- WELL, ASSOCIATE SLIM BARRISS, NOT TIM FERRISS, WHO IS TRYING THESE COMPOUNDS.
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
PLANT MEDICINE, AS IT WERE. BUT I SACRIFICED MYSELF IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE, AND I'M THE HUMAN GUINEA PIG, AND THEN I PROVIDE THE CLIFF NOTES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND WHETHER IT'S FASTING, KETOGENIC DIET, THE ICE EXPOSURE, OR JUST TRYING DIFFERENT APPS AND TECHNOLOGIES. TETRIS BEFORE BED TO FIX INSOMNIA, WHICH A GAME DESIGNER HAS FOUND VERY, VERY HELPFUL.
Jimmy: REALLY? I THINK, THIS IS ALL OF THESE BITS. IT'S ALL IN HERE. IT'S SO MUCH FUN. THERE'S ONE THING CALLED AC --
ACROYOGA.
Jimmy: ACROYOGA. AND I GO -- I SAW SOME DIAGRAM, I GO, I DON'T KNOW. HOW -- I MEAN, HOW WOULD YOU EVEN FIND OUT ABOUT THIS? AND WHAT IS THIS?
SO ACROYOGA IS ACROBATIC YOGA. YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS PARTNER ACROBATICS. AND IT HAS AN ACROBATIC COMPONENT AND A THERAPEUTIC COMPONENT. I FOUND OUT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I WAS IN VENICE, HAVING DINNER AT A FRIENDS HOUSE, AND THE CO-FOUNDER ENDED UP SITTING NEXT TO ME, JASON NEMER. MY BACK HURT. AND HE SAID, "WELL, DO YOU WANT TO FLY?" AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS. I WAS LIKE, SURE. HE PUT ME ON HIS FEET AND SPUN ME AROUND FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES, THEN MY BACK NO LONGER HURT, MY HIPS NO LONGER HURT. SO I HAVE, FROM A JOINT STANDPOINT, THE GREATEST HEALTH I'VE EVER HAD AND I AM ALMOST 40 AT THIS POINT. BETTER THAN WHEN I WAS 20. SO, IT'S -- IT'S A TREMENDOUS PRACTICE. I MEAN, I COULD TAKE YOU UP IN THE AIR IF YOU WANT. GIVE YOU A SPIN.
Jimmy: COULD YOU SHOW ME WHAT -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU COULD DO THAT?
YOU WANT TO TRY?
Jimmy: LET'S DO IT.
