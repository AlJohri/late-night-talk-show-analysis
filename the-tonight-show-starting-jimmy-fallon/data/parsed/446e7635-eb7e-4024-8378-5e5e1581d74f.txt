HE'S RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION UP IN TORONTO. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK HE'S GOING TO WIN. ANYWAYS, HE WAS UP FOR RE-ELECTION LAST NIGHT IN TORONTO. AND LAST NIGHT WAS THE FIRST BIG DEBATE. AND AT THE DEBATE HE WAS CALLED AN INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] EVEN WORSE, THAT WAS THE INTRODUCTION FORD WROTE FOR HIMSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] "I'LL COIN THAT PHRASE." THE DEBATE WAS ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. FORD SAID IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE THE CITY'S BUS AND SUBWAY STATIONS. HE SAID, "I RELY ON THOSE THINGS. I'M WAY TOO DRUNK TO DRIVE MYSELF. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] PLUS, THOSE ARE THE PLACES I BUY THE BEST CRACK. I MEAN THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THE --" AND THIS IS NICE I SAW PRESIDENT OBAMA VISITED WITH POPE FRANCIS TODAY.

WELL, THE DEADLINE ITSELF ISN'T A JOKE, BUT IF BOEHNER WANTS OBAMACARE JOKES WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP HIM OUT HERE AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ LAUGHTER ] SO, HOW ABOUT THIS? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OBAMACARE WEBSITE AND LAKE MICHIGAN? LAKE MICHIGAN IS ONLY FROZEN PART OF THE YEAR. ♪♪ WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD?

THANK YOU FOR ASKING. [ LAUGHTER ] I TOOK A BATH TONIGHT AND THE WATER WENT WHOOSH! ♪♪ [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OKAY, ALL RIGHT. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT HAPPENING. I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THAT HAPPENING.
BUT I WAS BANNED FOR, WHAT IS IT, 25, 26 YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU NEVER PITCHED THEM ANY SHOWS OR WANTED TO COME BACK TO NBC, OR --?
I PITCHED CONSTANTLY. THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT WHAT I HAD TO SHOW. I HAD A GREAT SHOW. HOW TO TOILET TRAINING CHILDREN. I CALLED IT "HOWDY DOODY." THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT. I HAD A JEWISH RELIGIOUS SHOW CALLED "700 CLUB AND THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: 700. THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT. NOT A PENNY MORE.
Jimmy: BUT THEN -- BUT LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE ON E! I MEAN, "FASHION POLICE" IS A A GIANT HIT.
GIANT HIT.
Jimmy: KNOCK ON WOOD. AND THEN YOU HAVE "JOAN AND MELISSA: JOAN KNOWS BEST." LAST SEASON I WATCHED IT. I HAD YOU ON "LATE NIGHT."
YOU WERE ON.
Jimmy: I WAS ON LAST SEASON. BUT THEN YOU HAD AN EPISODE, I DON'T KNOW IF WE TALKED ABOUT IT. YOU GOT STONED --
YEAH.
Jimmy: -- DURING AN EPISODE AND WENT AND ATE CHEESEBURGERS AT LIKE 3:00 IN THE MORNING. AND IT WAS HILARIOUS. AND THEN THIS YEAR YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING -- THIS IS A LITTLE BIT RIDICULOUS. YOU HAVE --
SEE, NOW YOU'VE HURT MY FEELINGS. NO. I DO THIS YEAR. THE FIRST EPISODE OR WHATEVER. I DID A SEX TAPE.

Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT DO YOU --
SO I SAID TO MELISSA -- I WANTED MELISSA TO DO IT, I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT. AND RIGHT AWAY MELISSA, "I DON'T WANT TO DO IT." I MEAN, WHAT A PRUDE. AND I SAID, [ LAUGHTER ] SHE WOULDN'T DO IT.
Jimmy: JOAN, I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS LIKE -- DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT TOO OLD?
PEOPLE SAY -- SEE, NOW THAT'S VERY --
Jimmy: AGEIST?
YES, AGEIST. AGEIST. EVERY TIME PEOPLE SAY WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR AN OLD LADY SAY, "I'M COMING," UNLESS SHE'S GOING FOR THE DOOR.
Jimmy: OKAY, THAT MAKES SENSE, YEAH.
THAT JUST ANNOYS ME.
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT JOAN, BUT HONESTLY, YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF DEATH. YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF DEATH AND GETTING OLDER?
WELL, TOO LATE ABOUT GETTING OLDER. I MADE UP MY BUCKET LIST. NUMBER ONE IS, "WAKE UP." [ LAUGHTER ] NO, I'M NOT AFRAID. MY FATHER WAS A DOCTOR.
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
SO I WAS AROUND DEATH ALL MY LIFE. I WAS VERY USED TO IT BECAUSE HE WAS A [ BLEEP ] DOCTOR.
