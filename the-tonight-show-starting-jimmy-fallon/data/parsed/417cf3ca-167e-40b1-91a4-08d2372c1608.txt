I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A REAL CONNECTION HERE.
Jimmy: YOU'RE THE BEST. YEAH, I LOVE IT. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. THAT'S NORMAL MUSIC.
THAT'S NORMAL MUSIC. SO JAMES BLACK WROTE A SONG CALLED "MAGNOLIA TRIANGLE", WHICH IS IN 5/4, WHICH IS A A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE NORMALLY USED TO HEARING.
Jimmy: WHAT WOULD THAT BE LIKE?
THAT WOULD BE LIKE -- WORK WITH ME HERE. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. DRUM ROLL, DRUM ROLL. [ DRUM ROLL ]
Jimmy: FIVE.
YES.
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE. SO NORMALLY ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.
SO I TOLD THEM "LET'S PLAY THIS SONG." MY BASS PLAYER IS LOOKING AT ME LIKE DON'T PLAY THAT SONG. START WITH SOMETHING EASY, AND I SAID "I'M GOING TO PLAY 'MAGNOLIA TRIANGLE.'" I START TO PLAY IT. BY THE TIME WE FINISH ONE CHORUS, I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS. I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ONE WAS, I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TWO WAS --
Jimmy: THREE?
OR EVEN THREE. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. AND HE PUT HIS STICKS DOWN. HE WALKED TO THE BAR. HE GOT A DRINK, AND HE LEFT. HE LEFT THE CLUB. HE SAID "I'M NOT PLAYING WITH THIS AMATEUR ANYMORE." THAT WAS IT. HE LEFT. BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF EDUCATION THAT WE GOT, YOU KNOW. AND THAT'S WHAT ALLOWED ME TO BE -- TO LEARN ABOUT MUSIC. IT'S FUNNY, WHEN I'M A JUDGE ON "IDOL" NOW. THE PEOPLE --
Jimmy: YOU'RE GREAT, BY THE WAY.
OH, THANK YOU. MAN, YOU'RE TOUGH ON THOSE KIDS. OH, MY GOSH. YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
Jimmy: YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T WALK OUT.
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I JUST WALKED OUT?
Jimmy: SO AWFUL, I CAN'T EVEN COMMENT.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT -- YOUR HONESTY. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST BE NICE AND -- BECAUSE YOU ARE A NICE GUY. BUT YOU CAN'T JUST BE LIKE, OH, THAT WAS GREAT. YOU'RE GREAT. THAT DOESN'T HELP ANYBODY.
YEAH, IF YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT SOMETHING. WE GET LIKE 30 SECONDS. AND KEEP IN MIND, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE HANGING OUT. LIKE, I'M GOING OUT TO DINNER WITH THESE YOUNG PERFORMERS. I SEE THEM ON STAGE AND I DON'T EVEN GET A CHANCE TO MEET THEM UNTIL AFTER THEY'RE ELIMINATED FROM THE SHOW. SO IF YOU HAVE A REAL SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, YOU'RE GONNA SAY "THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO WORK ON AND YOU HAVE TO BE REAL SPECIFIC WITH THEM --"
Jimmy: BOO!
THAT SOUNDS SO FAMILIAR.
Jimmy: THEY BOO YOU, THOUGH.
THEY BOO ME AT STARBUCKS NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T --
Jimmy: AT STARBUCKS?
I'D LIKE A DECAF LATTE. BOO!
Jimmy: COME ON. ORDER SOMETHING ELSE! I THINK YOU'RE GREAT ON THE SHOW. I LOVE IT. OF COURSE, I'M A SUPERFAN OF YOURS. I FOLLOW YOU ON TWITTER, @HARRYCONNICKJR.
OH, COOL.
Jimmy: AND YOU MENTIONED ME.
I DID.
Jimmy: YOU TWEETED ABOUT ME.
YOU HAVE A DOPPELGANGER, YOU PROBABLY HAVE A LOT OF DOPPELGANGERS OUT THERE. BUT THIS ONE IMPARTICULAR --
Jimmy: BRAD PITT BEING ONE OF THEM.
YES.
Jimmy: I ALWAYS GET CONFUSED. I'M EASE LIE CONFUSED.
PEOPLE CONFUSE ME FOR TROY AIKMAN SOMETIMES. WHICH IS NICE, BECAUSE I THINK HE'S A HANDSOME GUY -- AND IT'S NICE.
Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD FOR TROY AIKMAN.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE HARRY CONNICK JR.
YEAH, BUT HE'S TROY AIKMAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW. YOU SAID I HAVE A DOPPELGANGER.
I THINK SO. I SAW THIS PICTURE ONLINE AND I THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE YOU.
Jimmy: "WHO KNEW JIMMY FALLON WAS A 1970s HORROR FILM PUPPETEER," IS WHAT YOU PUT. I DON'T THINK THAT LOOKS LIKE ME.
COME ON. COME ON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LET ME SEE. I DON'T KNOW.
AM I RIGHT? THAT'S CRAZY. YES. YES.
Jimmy: JUST LEAVE THIS HERE.
YES. YES. YES. LIKE A WHITE TRASH ABE LINCOLN THING GOING ON THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] FOUR SCORE AND EVERYTHING THAT'S BROKEN IS ON MY FRONT PORCH.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT. HERE WE GO. THIS GUY HERE.
YES. THAT'S IT, MAN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YES. YES. YES. YES. YES. I WANNA BE -- CAN I BE THIS GUY?
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU CAN BE THAT DUDE. WHAT AM I DOING? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE GOT IT RIGHT THERE. I LOVE IT. YOU'RE THE BEST RIGHT THERE. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
