Jimmy: HOT CROWD RIGHT THERE TONIGHT! I FEEL THE LOVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW", EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I FEEL THE LOVE. I FEEL IT ALREADY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I KNOW YOU'RE NOT HERE FOR ME. YOU'RE HERE FOR BARBARA. I HEAR YOU. [ CHEERS ] THAT'S VERY, VERY EXCITING, BUT I'VE GOT TO GET TO SOME NEWS. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL TRAVEL TO IOWA THIS WEEK, THREE DAYS AFTER HILLARY CLINTON'S HIGH PROFILE RETURN TO THE STATE. YEP, HE'LL SPEND TWO DAYS THERE, ONE CAMPAIGNING, ANOTHER STUCK IN A CORN MAZE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHERE THE HECK AM I? I SEE BIDEN WILL BE IN IOWA TO HELP A GROUP OF NUNS CALLED NUNS ON THE BUS KICK OFF THEIR VOTER REGISTRATION TOUR. [ LAUGHTER ] BIDEN SAYS IT'S HIS WAY OF GIVING BACK WHILE THE NUNS SAY IT'S GOD'S WAY OF TESTING THEIR FAITH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DID YOU SEE THIS? IT'S THIS FUNNY CLIP. THE PRESIDENT THE OTHER DAY -- PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS VISITING A A SCHOOL IN WASHINGTON AND ONE LITTLE GIRL WAS VERY HONEST ABOUT HOW SHE FELT ABOUT HIM BEING THERE. CHECK OUT WHAT SHE SAID.
MR. PRESIDENT?
YES. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] I HEARD WHEN THEY SAID SOMEBODY VERY IMPORTANT WAS COMING I REALLY WANTED IT TO BE BEYONCE.
I UNDERSTAND. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT. IN FAIRNESS, IF SOMEONE TELLS ME THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD WAS COMING, I'D BE LIKE, "BEYONCE? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BARBRA STREISAND?" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY REVEALED THAT HE HAS SPENT THE LAST 20 MONTHS PREPARING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THEN HILLARY SAID, "CALL ME WHEN YOU SPEND 67 YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M READY, BABY." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO CHECK THIS OUT. THE PRODUCERS OF "NAKED AND AFRAID," YOU KNOW THAT SHOW? YEAH. ANYWAY, THE PRODUCERS OF "NAKED AND AFRAID," ARE COMING OUT WITH A NEW REALITY SHOW FEATURING REPUBLICAN SENATOR JEFF FLAKE AND DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARTIN HEINRICH LIVING ON A DESERT ISLAND TOGETHER. THEY ALREADY FILMED THE SHOW SO NOW THE SENATORS ARE BACK IN CONGRESS, BUT I THINK THE EXPERIENCE OF LIVING ON A A DESERT ISLAND IS STILL WITH THEM. WATCH WHAT I MEAN.
HOW CAN WE BE ASSURED HERE THAT THE NEW PROTOCOLS THAT ARE IN PLACE WITH THESE NEW RECOMMENDATIONS BEING IMPLEMENTED WILL BE FOLLOWED? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? SOMETHING'S OFF.
Steve: SOMETHING'S OFF. SOMETHING'S A TINY BIT OFF.
Jimmy: AND THIS IS COOL. I READ THAT POPE FRANCIS' HOME COUNTRY OF ARGENTINA IS BUILDING A NEW SOCCER STADIUM THAT WILL BE NAMED AFTER HIM. YEAH. AND TODAY THE POPE BLESSED THE STADIUM, HE SAID, "IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, THE SON AND THE HOLY GHOOOOOOOOOOOOOST!" [ APPLAUSE ] VERY NICE OF HIM.
Steve: BEAUTIFUL.
Jimmy: LISTEN TO THIS. A NEW SURVEY FOUND THAT 75% OF WOMEN WOULD RATHER DATE A MAN WITH LOVE HANDLES INSTEAD OF A A SIX PACK. IRONICALLY, THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF THOSE LOVE HANDLES IS ACTUALLY SIX PACKS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LITTLE TRIVIA. LITTLE TRIVIA FOR YA THERE. SPEAKING OF DATING, I HEARD ABOUT A NEW DATING APP SIMILAR TO TINDER CALLED THE LEAGUE FOR PEOPLE WHO GO TO IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS. YEAH, AND WE ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH A FEW PICK UP LINES FOR IVE LEAGUE STUDENTS TO TRY OUT WHEN THEY USE THE APP. ALL RIGHT, HERE ARE A FEW. FIRST, "I'M GOING TO CALL YOU MY S.A.T. SCORE BECAUSE YOU ARE PERFECT." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NICE. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. "I'M A LOT LIKE BROWN UNIVERSITY. I LOOK GOOD ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT I WILL TAKE WHATEVER I CAN GET." [ LAUGHTER ] THOSE ARE ALL HELPFUL.
Steve: OH MY.
Jimmy: HOW ABOUT THIS ONE. "DO YOUR ARMS HURT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN ROWING CREW THROUGH MY MIND ALL DAY?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, "IS YOUR FATHER A A THIEF? IF SO, WHICH BANK DOES HE WORK FOR?" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THOSE ARE PRETTY HELPFUL.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: I TRY TO HELP PEOPLE OUT. [ APPLAUSE ] SOME CELEBRITY NEWS. KANYE WEST IS DOING FINE AFTER HE WAS TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL IN AUSTRALIA BECAUSE OF AN INTENSE MIGRAINE. KIM WAS LIKE, "ARE YOU OKAY?" AND KANYE WAS LIKE, "THERE IT IS AGAIN. THERE IT IS. [ LAUGHTER ] COMING BACK. IT'S COMING BACK AGAIN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS ISN'T REALLY THAT SURPRISING, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDIES THAT SAY MOST PEOPLE GET THEIR NEWS FROM FACEBOOK. YEAH. AND WHEN FACEBOOK FOUND THIS OUT, THEY DECIDED TO START PRINTING A DAILY NEWSPAPER. AND WE GOT A COPY, SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF TODAY'S HEADLINES. HERE WE GO. ♪♪ [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THE TOP STORY IS, "MAN CLICKS 'MAYBE' ON EVENT HE HAS NO INTENTION OF ACTUALLY GOING TO." [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT HEADLINE IS, "YOUR AUNT OFFICIALLY LAST PERSON ON EARTH TO DO ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT HEADLINE IS, "HORROR DAWNING ON MAN REALIZING OLD GIRLFRIEND AND NEW GIRLFRIEND ARE FACEBOOK FRIENDS." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS TERRIFYING.
Steve: NO, THAT'S NOT GOOD.
Jimmy: NEXT HEADLINE IS, "HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND WHO USUALLY JUST POSTS ABOUT CHILI'S TOO HAS STRONG OPINIONS ON MIDDLE EAST." [ LAUGHTER ] NEED TO BOMB ISIS. HAVE YOU TRIED THESE NACHOS? THEY'RE TIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] TIGHT NACHOS. OUR NEXT HEADLINE IS, "CREEPY CO-WORKER LIKES PHOTO OF YOU FROM 11 MONTHS AGO." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DIDN'T POSE FOR THAT. I MEAN, IT'S CHRISTMAS TIME. AND OUR LAST HEADLINE IS, "GROWN MAN SPELLS 'OH MY GOD' AS 'ERMAHGERD.'" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ERMAHGERD! ERMAHGERD!
Steve: ERMAHGERD!
Jimmy: YEAH. AND FINALLY, THIS REALLY MADE ME LAUGH. LAST WEEK, SOUTH CAROLINA CONGRESSMAN JAMES CLYBURN WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY GIVES US LOTS OF WAYS TO PARTICIPATE IN POLITICS. HE'S 74 YEARS OLD, SO I'M NOT SURE HE'S FAMILIAR WITH EVERYTHING HE'S MENTIONED. JUST LISTEN TO HIM.
YOU GOT GREAT TOOLS TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE. WE CAN TEXT, WHAT DO WE CALL IT, SEXTING? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GRANDPA NO! GRANDPA STOP! WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: ARE YOU REALLY?
I'M ALLERGIC TO HORSES.
Jimmy: HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
I GET AN ASTHMA ATTACK. SO I DON'T GO NEAR HORSES. I WENT TO A CIRCUS ONE TIME AND I START -- I DIDN'T EVEN SEE ANY HORSES. I STARTED TO, YOU KNOW, LOSE MY AIRWAYS.
Jimmy: MAYBE YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO CLOWNS.

MM-HMM.
Jimmy: WHERE YOU DIDN'T PERFORM. I THINK 27 YEARS YOU DIDN'T PERFORM.

Jimmy: I MEAN, I'M JUST SO EXCITED. I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE RECORD. THE RECORD'S GREAT. YOU HAVE ALL THE GOOD SONGS. "IT HAD TO BE YOU" WITH MICHAEL BUBLE. OF COURSE I WAS AVAILABLE. "PEOPLE" YOU DO -- REMAKE "PEOPLE" WITH STEVIE WONDER.
OH YEAH. HE'S INCREDIBLE. HE'S A WHOLE OTHER -- [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHY WOULD YOU -- WHY WOULD YOU EVER REMAKE THAT OR DO THAT AGAIN? DO YOU --
IT'S NOT REMAKING. IT'S TRYING TO REINTERPRET SOMETHING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND IT WAS NEVER SUNG AS A DUET. CERTAINLY NO MALE SINGER HAS EVER SUNG "PEOPLE" OR "THE WAY WE WERE," EVEN. NO. [ CHEERS ] BUT WE LIKE TO USE IT.
Jimmy: "THE WAY WE WERE" YOU DO WITH LIONEL RICHIE.
YEAH, HE'S GREAT.
Jimmy: OH, THIS RECORD, YOU'RE GONNA FREAK OUT, GUYS. IT'S -- AND THE ELVIS PRESLEY THING, I MEAN, HOW DID THAT IDEA COME ABOUT?
WELL, IT WASN'T MINE. IT WAS MY A&R MAN'S IDEA --
Jimmy: YEAH.
--TO GET THIS TRACK. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE, I'M NOT SURE.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW.
WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE TO -- FOR THE ESTATE TO LET US -- HAVE THAT TRACK.
Jimmy: ONE OF THE ONES -- I LOVE IS "NEW YORK STATE OF MIND" WITH BILLY JOEL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I -- I'VE HEARD HIM TALK IN INTERVIEWS AND I'VE HEARD HIM SAY HE CREDITS YOU FOR HIS CAREER --
AWW. THAT'S SO SWEET.
Jimmy:  --BECAUSE YOU SANG A A VERSION ON YOUR "SUPERMAN" ALBUM --
RIGHT.
Jimmy:  --WHICH I GOTTA SAY IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUM COVERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
WHOO! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I MEAN -- WHOA! OH LA, LA, LA. OOH, LA, LA, SASSON. LOOK AT THE BACK AT THE LINER NOTES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BARBARA! I MEAN, COME ON. SUPERMAN.
WHEN THE TUSH WAS UP, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ LAUGHTER ] NO, HE'S A DOLL. HE'S SUCH A DOLL. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE SAID THE RECORD COMPANY -- IF I RECORDED IT, IT MUST MEAN SOMETHING.
Jimmy: YEAH!
BUT NO, WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR HIS VOICE -- AND HIS MUSICALITY. ALL MY PARTNERS ARE SO FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU DO --
I'M SO LUCKY.
Jimmy: YOU DO "WHAT KIND OF FOOL" WITH JOHN LEGEND.
GREAT VOICE.
Jimmy: AND OF COURSE, THE ORIGINAL I LOVE IS WITH MY MAN BARRY GIBB.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I JUST -- I LOVE BARRY --
HE WAS ON YOUR SHOW, RIGHT?
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T EVEN HEAR HIM TALK LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S NOT -- YEAH. I WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT -- WE HAD BARRY COME ON. WE HAD BARRY COME ON OUR SHOW AND WE HAD HIM DRESS IN THE TUXEDO, THE CREAM TUXEDO. THE THREE-PIECE TUXEDO, OR IT'S LIKE AN EIGHT-PIECE TUXEDO -- WITH ALL THE CHEST HAIR AND THE MEDALLIONS AND WE TOTALLY WENT FOR IT AND DID IT AND THEN I WAS TALKING TO YOU BACKSTAGE ABOUT THIS, AND -- YOU MADE HIM WEAR THE WHITE THING ON THE "GUILTY" COVER.
WELL I'M SUCH A NUT FOR ART DIRECTION. SO I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE AN INTERESTING COVER, YOU KNOW. ALL WHITE. WHITE BACKGROUND, BOTH OF US IN WHITE. YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT'S MY LITTLE CRAZINESS BUT --
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT CRAZY.
I LIKE IT. I LIKE IT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS STUFF. I MEAN, ONCE YOU WENT INTO FILMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT, YOU STARTED BREAKING MORE GROUND IN FILM BY -- YOU WERE THE FIRST WOMAN TO WRITE, PRODUCE, DIRECT AND ACT IN YOUR -- IN YOUR OWN MOVIE. THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DID YOU EVER FORESEE YOURSELF DOING THIS STUFF?
YOU HAVE NOBODY TO ARGUE WITH, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, BARBRA. NO PROBLEM, BARBRA. THAT'S THE BEST -- THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELL, I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S A BIG THRILL FOR ME TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS AFTER 50 YEARS, YOU COMING ON OUR PROGRAM. WE'RE JUST HONOREDED TO HAVE YOU HERE AND IT'S SO FUN AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND YOU'RE JUST THE MOST FUN PERSON.
