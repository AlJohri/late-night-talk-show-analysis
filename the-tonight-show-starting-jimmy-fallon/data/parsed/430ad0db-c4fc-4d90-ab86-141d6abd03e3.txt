18-34, I KNOW, I'M 35. I THINK I DID THAT ON PURPOSE, FOR ME SO THAT I COULD GET IN ON IT.
Jimmy: WHAT IS  WHAT IS -- WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE?
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, DON'T HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO DO CODE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A COLLEGE GRADUATE, EVEN. IF YOU HAVE A GREAT IDEA THAT IN SOME WAY CAN BENEFIT THE LATINO COMMUNITY, WE'RE IN FOR IT. IT'S LIKE THIS -- THIS GUY CREATED AN APP ACTUALLY IN OAKLAND. SOMETHING SIMILAR LIKE THIS -- WHERE THE KIDS WHO ARE GOING HOME FROM SCHOOL, THEY'LL BE ALERTED IF THERE'S GANG ACTIVITY THAT'S GOING ON. SO THEY CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CIRCUMVENT IT IN ORDER TO GET HOME SAFELY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO LIKE STUFF LIKE THAT. COOL IDEAS LIKE THAT.

THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT BOOKS. SO THIS IS US GETTING INTO ANOTHER BOOK AND GETTING INTO THESE CHARACTERS ON DIFFERENT NIGHTS. THEY'RE EXPLAINING CERTAIN THINGS. SO IN THE FIRST FILM, YOU KNOW DWIGHT HAS A NEW FACE. NOW WE GET TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT COMES FROM. AND WHERE THIS SORT OF LOVE-HATE AND THING THAT'S BETWEEN THESE TWO CHARACTERS COMES FROM.
Jimmy: PERSONALLY, IT'S AMAZING, CINEMATICALLY TO LOOK AT. AND YOU'RE JUST GO, "HOW ARE THEY DOING ALL OF THIS STUFF?" IT WAS LIKE BLACK AND WHITE, BUT IT WAS JUST AMAZING. VERY NOIR, GANGSTER TYPE OF THING -- MICKEY ROURKE, TOTALLY DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HIM AT ALL. IT WAS JUST FANTASTIC. AND THIS ONE, I GUESS FRANK MILLER WANTED TO WAIT BECAUSE OF 3D?
YEAH.
Jimmy: THE TECHNOLOGY.
YOU CAN SEE -- WITH THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IT JUST RAMPS IT UP INTO A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL. IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY COOL. AND IT WAS AMAZING TO GET BACK AND TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK INTO THIS CHARACTER AGAIN. I WAS REALLY GLAD HE WASN'T PUSHING IT TOO MUCH FURTHER. BECAUSE I WAS LIKE "DUDE, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I CAN WEAR THAT OUTFIT." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN FITS IN THE PALM OF MY HAND. I'M LIKE, "COME ON GUYS."

Jimmy: AND YOU SHAVED THE HEAD?

Jimmy: IT LOOKS GREAT.
I'VE BEEN PLANNING ON DOING THIS FOR YEARS 'CAUSE I'VE WANTED TO DO IT. IF YOU LOOK AT MY MOM'S TWITTER PROFILE, SHE'S GOT THE COOLEST PICTURE ON THE PLANET. SHE'S GOT A MOHAWK. SO LITERALLY WHEN I SHAVED HALF OF MY HEAD, MY FAMILY WAS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU WANT TO PUT A TATOO ON YOUR FACE, MAYBE WE CAN TALK TO YOU -- BUT THAT'S NOT THAT INTERESTING. NO, BUT I DID IT FOR THE FILM AND IT'S JUST -- I WORKED ON IT THREE DAYS. SO I HAD TO ROCK A COMB OVER FOR TWO OTHER MOVIES THAT I HAD TO WORK WITH. 'CAUSE IT'S NOT THE MOST VERSATILE HAIRCUT.
