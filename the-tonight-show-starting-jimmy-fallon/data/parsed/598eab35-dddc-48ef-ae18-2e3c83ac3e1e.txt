Jimmy: OH, RIGHT BACK ATCHA! RIGHT BACK ATCHA! I LOVE YOU GUYS. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, BABY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME! WE'RE HERE. WE'RE ALL HERE TOGETHER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FUN TIME TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, EVERYBODY. OF COURSE IT'S OUR PAL DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] YESTERDAY A MAJOR IOWA NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED AN OP-ED AGAINST TRUMP. THEY CALLED HIM A "SELF-ABSORBED, WHOLLY UNQUALIFIED FECKLESS BLOWHARD." [ LAUGHTER ] OR AS TRUMP PUT IT, "YOU FORGOT VERY RICH. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M A VERY RICH, SELF-ABSORBED, WHOLLY UNQUALIFIED FECKLESS BLOWHARD. VERY, VERY RICH. FECK OFF." THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. NO -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY? THAT'S WHAT DONALD SAID?
Jimmy: NO, NO. HE DIDN'T SAY THAT. AFTER DONALD TRUMP MADE LINDSEY GRAHAM'S PHONE NUMBER PUBLIC YESTERDAY -- DID YOU SEE THAT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: HE WROTE IT ON A A PIECE -- DID YOU SEE IT? IT'S FANTASTIC, MAN. HE JUST WROTE LINDSEY GRAHAM'S CELL PHONE NUMBER ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND SHOWED IT OUT TO EVERYBODY. GAVE OUT HIS CELL PHONE NUMBER TO THE WORLD, YEAH. WELL AFTER HE DID THAT IN PUBLIC YESTERDAY, GRAHAM SAID HE'S GETTING A NEW PHONE. WHICH EXPLAINS LINDSEY GRAHAM'S LATEST CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, "NEW PHONE, WHO DIS?" [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S VERY HARD. IT'S HARD. I DON'T KNOW WHOSE TEXTING ME. I DON'T KNOW. IN A NEW INTERVIEW, LINDSEY GRAHAM CRITICIZED DONALD TRUMP'S RECENT ACTIONS, AND I THINK YOU CAN TELL HE'S GETTING MAD. WATCH THIS.
I AM REALLY PISSED BECAUSE, COME ON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: "I MEAN, I AM JUST MAD, RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN CALL ME APPLE PIE BECAUSE HE'S ABOUT TO GET A A PIECE OF ME. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW MAD I AM. I'M JUST SO UPSET RIGHT NOW. I'M GOING TO TURN INTO THE HULK. [ LAUGHTER ] MY SHORTS GET ALL RIPPED OFF. AND WALKING AROUND WITH MY RIPPED SHORTS RIPPED OFF AND MAD LIKE THE HULK. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT GUY JUST BUTTERED MY BISCUITS JUST NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I DON'T LIKE MY BISCUITS BUTTERED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I LIKE THEM WITH GRAVY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SWEETEST SOUNDING GUY GETTING MAD AT YOU.
Steve: ANGRY.
Jimmy: HE SOUNDS SO NICE. HE'S LIKE, "I'M JUST SO MAD I COULD JUST NEEDLEPOINT A PILLOW RIGHT NOW." [ LAUGHTER ] NEEDLEPOINT A PILLOW? MEANWHILE, OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH BECAME THE 16th REPUBLICAN TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. YESTERDAY, I READ THAT DURING HIS SPEECH HE REFERRED TO JESUS CHRIST, WHICH IS IRONIC BECAUSE SO DID AMERICANS WHEN THEY HEARD ANOTHER REPUBLICAN WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CHEESE AND CRACKERS, ANOTHER REPUBLICAN.
Steve: CHEESE AND BISCUITS.
Jimmy: AND THIS IS IN THE NEWS TODAY. JOE BIDEN WAS SPOTTED WITH A A BRUISE ON HIS FACE THAT WAS APPARENTLY CAUSED BY HIS DOG. I GUESS THEY COLLIDED WHEN THEY BOTH WENT AFTER THE SAME TENNIS BALL, WHICH HAPPENS -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT HAPPENS. YOU JUST GOT TO GO WITH REFLEXES ALONE. THAT'S WHERE YOU MAKE A A MISTAKE. OF COURSE THE OTHER BIG NEWS, THIS WEEK IS THAT THE U.S. OFFICIALLY REESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH CUBA. YEP, THAT'S GREAT. JOHN KERRY SPOKE ON THE ISSUE YESTERDAY, AND HE EVEN GAVE PART OF HIS SPEECH IN SPANISH. WHICH BRINGS US TO A NEW SEGMENT CALLED, "POLITICIANS TRY TO SPEAK SPANISH." HE WERE GO. [ SPANISH ] [ LAUGHTER ] [ SPANISH ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT LAST ONE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KLINGON. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THAT LAST ONE -- [ IMITATES FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] LIKE "GAME OF THRONES." [ IMITATES FOREIGN LANGUAGE ]
Steve: YES.
Jimmy: OH, TONIGHT WAS THE BIG PREMIERE OF "SHARKNADO 3" OVER ON THE SCI-FI CHANNEL. I WATCHED IT, AND I THINK THE BEST ACTOR WAS ME JUST NOW SAYING I WATCHED "SHARKNADO 3." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Steve: BOOM!
Jimmy: "THEY'LL NEVER BE AS GOOD AS THE BOOK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND HE JUST MAKES ME SO ANGRY SOMETIMES. THAT I HAD TO PUT DOWN MY SPOONFUL OF BROTH. I DON'T LIKE CHUNKS IN MY SOUP, SO -- SHE JUST MADE ME SO MAD, I PUT MY SOUP OVER TO THE SIDE AND I JUST LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND JUST PONDERED FOR TWO SECONDS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW MAD I WAS."
Steve: "I WAS SO MAD."
Jimmy: "I PAUSED MY EPISODE OF 'SMALLVILLE' I'M TRYING TO BING WATCH, AND I SAID, 'I'LL CATCH UP TO IT WHEN MY HEAD IS CLEAR AND I UNDERSTAND.' RIGHT NOW IT'S ALL MESSED UP LIKE ONE OF THOSE PUZZLE BAR GAMES WHERE YOU SEE THE IRON THING YOU HAVE TO SOLVE, AND I GO, 'I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THIS. JUST GET ME A DANG NON-ALCOHOLIC BEER, YOU KNOW?'" [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS TODAY. I GUESS AFTER THE VMA NOMINATIONS WERE ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT, NICKI MINAJ FELT SNUBBED. SO APPARENTLY SHE TWEETED A JAB AT TAYLOR SWIFT SAYING, "YOUR VIDEO HAS TO HAVE WOMEN WITH SLIM BODIES TO GET NOMINATED." TAYLOR THEN TWEETED BACK THAT WOMEN SHOULDN'T TURN ON EACH OTHER. MAYBE ONE OF THE MEN TOOK HER SLOT. APPARENTLY THEY'VE ALREADY MADE UP, BUT NOT BEFORE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE GOT INVOLVED. IT WAS A LITTLE MESSY. BECAUSE KIM KARDASHIAN ALSO SEEMED TO THROW A SHADE AT TAYLOR BY TWEETING, "I'MA LET YOU FINISH." [ LAUGHTER ] SHE THEN APOLOGIZED WITH THIS TWEET, "I'M NOT TRYING TO SHADE ANYONE. THAT'S NOT MY STYLE. I JUST THOUGHT THAT CAPTION WAS PERFECT FOR THAT PIC. CHANGING THE CAPTION NOW. #IRONIC." SEEMED INNOCENT ENOUGH. BUT THEN, AFTER THAT, ALANIS MORISSETTE SENT HER OWN TWEET THAT SAID, "HEY, ARE YOU THROWING SHADE AT MY SONG, 'IRONIC?' HOW DARE YOU? IT WAS A HUGE HIT IN '96. #YOUOUGHTAKNOW." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEN AFTER THAT, LARRY KING RESPONDED, "ARE YOU THROWING SHADE AT MY AGE? I'M 96. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I CAN STILL GET IT DONE WHEN IT COUNTS. #TALKINBOUTSEXBABY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEN AFTER THAT SALT-N-PEPA RESPONDED, "ARE YOU THROWING SHADE AT OUR SONG 'LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX?" #EVERYBODYHASSEX." THEN AFTER THAT, TIM TEBOW RESPONDED, "ARE YOU THROWING SHADE AT HOW I'VE NEVER HAD SEX? IT'S MY CHOICE. #NORINGNOFLING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEN AFTER THAT, TOM BRADY RESPONDED, "HEY, AT LEAST SOMEBODY HERE CAN THROW. #SHADETHROWN." [ AUDIENCE OHS ] SO AFTER THAT, TIM TEBOW RESPONDED, "AT LEAST MY BALLS ARE THE RIGHT SIZE. #SHADEHANDEDOFF." [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TO WHICH LARRY KING RESPONDED, "LIKE I TOLD YOU, THEY STILL WORK JUST FINE. #LAIDINTHESHADE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HAVE A GREAT SHOW. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

THANK YOU. ALWAYS NICE TO BE HERE.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND WELL, YOU'VE BEEN COMING ON THE SHOW FOR A WHILE NOW, AND WE BOTH KIND OF HAVE GROWN UP ON THAT.
I KNOW. WE'VE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW -- WE'VE GOT KIDS NOW AND I'M A A MARRIED LADY.
Jimmy: NOT ME AND YOU. YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND HAVE KIDS.
YES.
Jimmy: ME AND MY WIFE HAVE KIDS.
YES. YES.
Jimmy: WE NEVER --
NOT TOGETHER.
Jimmy: NO, WE NEVER --
ALTHOUGH NICK ALWAYS DOES SAY THAT IF THERE WAS ANYONE TO PLAY HIM ON HIS LIFETIME BIOPIC, WHICH HE IMAGINES IS SOME DAY GOING TO BE PRODUCED, HE WANTS IT TO BE YOU.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO NICE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND I COULD PLAY NICK SWISHER.
YES.
Jimmy: THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC. I WOULD TOTALLY DO THAT.
IT'S EITHER YOU OR MATT BOMER. JUST FULL DISCLOSURE, THERE'S TWO GUYS UP FOR THE JOB.
Jimmy: MATT BOMER IS A VERY GOOD LOOKING GUY.
HE IS. HE IS. BUT YOU'VE GOT MY VOTE.
Jimmy: I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU NOW HAVE A CHILD. HOW OLD IS YOUR BABY?
EMMY IS A LITTLE OVER 2 YEARS OLD.
Jimmy: COME ON. HOW CUTE.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. IT WAS JUST HER BIRTHDAY, RIGHT?
IT WAS JUST HER BIRTHDAY IN MAY. IT'S SO CRAZY TO SEE HOW SHE --
Jimmy: THIS IS HER HERE. COME ON. LOOK AT THAT. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
THAT WAS AT HER BIRTHDAY PARTY.
Jimmy: MY GOSH. THERE'S A PONY. [ APPLAUSE ] BEAUTIFUL KID. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU. IT'S A LOT OF FUN, RIGHT?
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. WHAT IS SHE INTO RIGHT NOW?
ANIMALS. EVERYTHING. ANIMALS, ELSA. SHE LOVES TO DANCE. ALTHOUGH SHE HAS MY RHYTHM, WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE FOR HER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT A GOOD DANCER?
I MEAN, GIVE ME A FEW COCKTAILS AND I'M GREAT AT EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT YOU'RE NOT --
I DON'T --
GIVE ME A FEW COCKTAILS AND I'M GREAT AT EVERYTHING BUT ONE THING. [ LAUGHTER ]
BY THE WAY, I'M SO GOOD AT THAT ONE THING THAT IF I HAD A A FEW COCKTAILS I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN NOTICE.
WOW. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A A YAK ON MY CHEST RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR SHOW. THIS IS A BIG HIT. THIS IS A GIANT THING FOR A A SHOW TO COME OUT IN THE SUMMER LIKE NORM'S SHOW "LAST COMIC STANDING." YOUR SHOW CAME OUT, "ASTRONAUTS WIVES." LOOK AT THIS, THIS IS A REAL COVER FROM "LIFE" MAGAZINE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S REAL WIVES OF WHAT?
IT'S THE STORY ABOUT THE WIVES OF THE FIRST SEVEN ASTRONAUTS, THE MERCURY SEVEN. I PLAY GUS GRISSOM'S WIFE, BETTIE GRISSOM. AND IT'S TOLD FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE. AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW THE STORY OF US -- YOU KNOW, OUR FIRST LAUNCH INTO SPACE AND ALL OF THESE THINGS. BUT IT'S TOLD FROM SUCH A A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE. AND I THINK -- WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN I WAS ASKED TO DO THE SHOW IS, THESE WOMEN -- THERE WAS SO MUCH ASKED OF THESE WOMEN. THEY WERE EXPECTED TO HAVE THEIR LIVES FOLLOWED BY "LIFE" MAGAZINE AND THEY WERE THROWN INTO THE MEDIA, AND THE SPOTLIGHT. THEY WERE SOCIALITES AND ALL THE WHILE THEIR HUSBANDS ARE BEING LAUNCHED INTO SPACE NOT REALLY KNOWING IF THEY'RE EVER GOING TO MAKE IT BACK.
Jimmy: SURE.
IT WAS REALLY STRESSFUL, BUT INCREDIBLY EXCITING. AND THEY'RE SIMPLE MILITARY WIVES AND ULTIMATELY -- SPOILER ALERT -- GUS DID PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE. SO BETTIE DID HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WORST NIGHTMARE.
Jimmy: IT'S VERY INTERESTING, BUT I THINK AN INTERESTING TIME, BECAUSE NO ONE KNEW WHAT SPACE WAS AND WE ALL JUST THOUGHT THE FUTURE WAS JET PACKS AND FLYING AROUND. AND JUST LIKE --
I STILL KIND OF WANT THE FUTURE TO BE LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: IT'S STILL NOT THE FUTURE. EVEN THOUGH NOW IT IS THE FUTURE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW, THE HOVER -- HOVER CARS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
YEAH, NO. WHENEVER THEY COME OUT WITH THE HOVER CAR I'M GETTING ONE.
PEOPLE ALWAYS GO, CAN WE TIME-TRAVEL AND EVERYTHING? YOU KNOW? I GO, WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW, BABY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: VERY INTERESTING. DO YOU GET TO GO INTO ANY OF THESE THINGS? DO YOU GET TO EXPERIENCE ANY OF THIS LIKE --
GO TO SPACE? I WOULD NOT GO TO SPACE.
Jimmy: NO, NO.
I'M TERRIBLE CLAUSTROPHOBIC. YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY GOT TO MEET JIM LOVELL. THAT WAS PRETTY EXCITING JUST TO HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT APOLLO 13.
THAT'S WHO TOM HANKS PLAYED.
YES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I GOT TO MEET HIS WIFE MARILYN. YEAH, IT IS REALLY EXCITING TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION, THE SPACE CONVERSATION. IT'S REALLY AN INCREDIBLE STORY. I THINK IT JUST EVOKES A SENSE OF WONDERMENT IN A SENSE OF LIKE, YOU KNOW. THERE'S SO MUCH WE HAVEN'T EXPLORED AND THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE DON'T KNOW. CERTAINLY WAY BACK THEN THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THERE'S MORE TECHNOLOGY IN OUR iPHONE.
A FRIEND OF MINE TRIED TO GET PEOPLE ON --
THE MARS TRIP?
YEAH.
ARE YOU INTERESTED? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WELL, HIS NAME IS ELON MUSK. DO YOU KNOW WHO ELON MUSK IS?
NO.
Jimmy: YES.
HE INVENTED SPACE X AND HE INVENTED THE, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: THE TESLA CAR?
TESLA.
OH, THAT'S A NICE CAR. THIS IS YOUR BUDDY?
YEAH.
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS.
REALLY DESERVES TO BE INCREDIBLY FAMOUS PERSON. BUT ANYWAY -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN BUY A ONE-WAY TICKET TO VENUS. NOT MARS. VENUS.
Jimmy: WHAT?
YEAH. YOU CAN BUY A ONE-WAY TICKET TO VENUS.
WHAT'S GOING ON IN VENUS?.
WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON IS A A LOT OF EARLY DEATH.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.
Jimmy: A ONE-WAY TICKET. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE FIRST GUY THERE.
JUST SAY GOOD-BYE.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE FIRST ONE THERE. NO. WELL, THIS -- IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW WE EVOLVED TO GET WHERE WE ARE WITH SPACE X. YOU SHOULD WATCH "THE ASTRONAUTS WIVES CLUB."
