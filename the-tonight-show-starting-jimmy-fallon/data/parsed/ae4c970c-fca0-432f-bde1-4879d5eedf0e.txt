WHY DID YOU GO? FOR THE SHOW. I GET IT. YEAH.
Jimmy: I DO WHATEVER I CAN TO ENTERTAIN THE PEOPLE.
YOU JUST DO WHAT THEY TELL YOU.

NO, BECAUSE I WENT TO A A HAUNTED HOUSE THAT WAS MORE LIKE CREEPY IMAGES. AND, LIKE, YOU KNOW, AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE GETTING UNDER YOUR SKIN AND YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY. BUT THEN IT WAS KIND OF SEXY TOO, KIND OF A SEXY, SCARY, SO YOU'RE CONFUSED. YOU'RE FEELING NEW FEELINGS, IT'S ALARMING.
Jimmy: WHAT? KEVIN HART AND I DID NOT GO TO STRIP CLUB. STRIP CLUB, SORRY I MEANT HAUNTED HOUSE. WE DID NOT GO TO THAT AT ALL.
NO, I MEAN I THINK MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S L.A., EVERYBODY HAS TO BE REALLY HOT. LIKE ALL THE ACTORS IN IT WERE, LIKE, REALLY HOT. AND THEY TOUCH YOU AND SAY STUFF TO YOU, AND, LIKE, AT A A CERTAIN POINT I WAS LIKE -- I WAS LIKE, SO WHEN ARE WE KICKING OFF THIS ORGY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
Jimmy: THIS WAS NOT MY --
AND I WENT AFTERWARDS AND LIKE SAID HI TO THE ACTORS AND --.

THEY HAVE LIKE THE OPPOSITE EXPERIENCE WHERE I WAS, LIKE, SO, LIKE, WHAT'S UP WITH YOU GUYS? AND THEY WERE LIKE, WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY HITTING ON YOU. WE'RE ACTORS. YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER. I WAS LIKE, COOL, I JUST THOUGHT THERE WAS MAYBE A VIBE. BUT -- PART OF THE SHOW. WELL DONE.
Jimmy: AND THEY'RE LIKE HANDING YOU RESUMES AND STUFF ON THE WAY OUT. THIS IS L.A. HOW DID I DO? WAS I SCARY? I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR EARLY CAREER BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR BROTHER WOULD AUDITION HERE IN NEW YORK.

AND AFTER A WHILE, THEY WERE LIKE, "IF YOU WANT TO KEEP AUDITIONING, YOU AND YOUR BROTHER CAN TAKE THE BUS DOWN TO NEW YORK FROM MAINE." AND I WAS LIKE 12 AND HE WAS 14, AND WE WOULD, LIKE, COME IN, AND USUALLY IT WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, SIX HOURS TO GET DOWN HERE AND WE WOULD DO LIKE 15 MINUTES IN A ROOM AND THEN SIX HOURS BACK.

SO I TOOK OUT A TINY PAPER PARASOL AND I ASKED THEM, "DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?" AND OF COURSE THEY ALL SAID, "IT'S AN UMBRELLA." AND I SAID, "NO, NO, IT'S A A PARASOL."

IT WAS A COMPLETE SURPRISE TO ME.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW WHO I CAN DO A GOOD IMPERSONATION OF? WINSTON CHURCHILL. WAIT, WHAT?
WELL, YOU KNOW, I IMMEDIATELY DIVED INTO AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH. I LISTENED TO LOTS OF VIDEO AND LOTS OF AUDIO, BUT IT ONLY REALLY TOOK HOLD WHEN I WORKED WITH THESE BRILLIANT COSTUME, MAKE-UP, AND HAIR PEOPLE IN ENGLAND. AFTER THEY GOT THROUGH WITH ME, I WAS A PASSABLE WINSTON.

DO SIT DOWN, PRIME MINISTER. I'VE ORDERED TEA OR SOMETHING STRONGER, PERHAPS.
OH DEAR. DID NO ONE EXPLAIN? A SOVEREIGN NEVER OFFERS A A PRIME MINISTER REFRESHMENT, NOR A CHAIR. THE PRECEDENT SET BY YOUR GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER WAS TO KEEP US STANDING LIKE PRIVY COUNSELORS. TO WASTE TIME IS A GRIEVOUS SIN.

THANK YOU! THIS IS SO FUN. SO, I WANT TO SHARE AN OPINION THAT PROBABLY WON'T BE VERY POPULAR, BUT I HATE LAS VEGAS. AND I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO LOVE IT BECAUSE I'M A GIRL AND WOMEN, WE HAVE THIS PAVLOVIAN RESPONSE, SOMEONE SAYS VEGAS AND WE'RE LIKE VEGAS. LIKE WE JUST AUTOMATICALLY -- LIKE, I SAID VEGAS HERE AND SOME WOMAN IN NEW JERSEY WAS LIKE, VEGAS! [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT LAS VEGAS ISN'T FOR WOMEN. IT'S ONLY FOR MEN. I WILL PROVE IT TO YOU. THE NUMBER ONE SPORT IN LAS VEGAS IS WHAT? KILLING PROSTITUTES. NO, YOU'RE CLOSE. IT'S -- LIGHTEN UP. IT'S GAMBLING. IT'S GAMBLING, AND THEY ONLY WANT MEN TO GAMBLE BECAUSE THEY INCENTIVIZE MEN TO GAMBLE WITH WHAT? FREE DRINKS. BUT WHO BRINGETH THE FREE DRINKS? WOMEN. IF THEY WANTED THE WOMEN TO STAY AND GAMBLE, THEY'D HAVE THE DUDE FROM THUNDER DOWN UNDER LIKE, HERE YOU GO SHEILA, BUT THEY DON'T. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I FEEL BAD BECAUSE THESE WOMEN ARE LIKE 80 YEARS OLD, EXHAUSTED, ICE SKATER PANTYHOSE, COMING OUT SHAKING UNDER 80 POUNDS OF FREE GIN AND GINGERS, LIKE, I REMEMBER WHEN THIS WAS ALL DESERT. THE ONLY THING THAT WOMEN ARE GIVEN IN LAS VEGAS IS THE SOCIETAL GO-AHEAD TO DRESS LIKE ABSOLUTE HOOKERS AND HAVE NO ONE JUDGE US. YEAH, THAT'S WHY WE GO. WE LAND AT McCARRAN, WE THROW OUR CLOTHES OUT THE WINDOW, WE COME OUT OF THE BATHROOM LIKE IT'S FLOSS AND A CORK. I'M EMPOWERED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE LOVE IT. AND WE STAY THAT DRESSED UP, EVEN WHEN WE GO TO THE POOL. RIGHT? AND YOU COME DOWN THERE WITH YOUR PACK OF GIRLFRIENDS. WE'RE ALWAYS IN VEGAS TO CELEBRATE, RIGHT? STACY'S GETTING MARRIED, BECKY'S GETTING A DIVORCE, KELLY GOT BANGED. WHATEVER IT IS. AND WE ARE DRESSED UP. WE ARE IN PRIMER AND SUNSCREEN AND FOUNDATION AND YOU JUST SPENT THE LAST HOUR WATCHING SOME SAUDI ARABIAN GIRL DOING A A MAKE-UP TUTORIAL ON INSTAGRAM, SO WE ARE CONTOURED LIKE NUTCRACKERS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU WALK OUTSIDE, YOU SET ONE FOOT OUTSIDE, AND YOU ARE MELTING. YOUR EYELASHES ARE CASCADING DOWN YOUR FACE LIKE CATERPILLARS, IT'S HOT, AND WE'RE IN HEELS. I DON'T KNOW WHY. EVERY SINGLE POOL IN THE WORLD HAS A SIGN ABOVE IT THAT SAYS, CAUTION, WET SURFACE. BUT FOR GIRLS, WE'RE LIKE, NOT ME, THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. I'M DOING IT. WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS STAYS IN VEGAS. YEAH, LIKE YOUR TEETH, STACY, WHEN YOU CRACK THEM ON THE PAVEMENT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PUT ON SOME FLIP-FLOPS. AND WE WEAR DUMB BATHING SUITS. LIKE THIS IS EXPENSIVE, AND IT'S CUT OUT HERE. IT'S CUT OUT HERE. IT'S LIKE, FINE. YOU CAN WEAR THAT, BUT I PROMISE YOU THIS, YOU'RE GOING TO BURN, AND YOU'RE GOING TO END UP LOOKING LIKE A A VIVISECTION OF A COW ON A A STEAK HOUSE MENU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I THINK THE WORST PART OF ABOUT LAS VEGAS HAS TO BE THE CABANAS, BECAUSE THE TYPES OF GUYS THAT GET CABANAS ARE THE WORST. THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE FOR JOEY'S BACHELOR PARTY, RIGHT? THEY'RE FIST PUMPING. THEY'VE ALL GOT FEDORAS, GOLD PLATED JEWELRY, OPEN SHIRTS, THEY'RE ALWAYS STUNNING BUT JACKED BUT THEY'VE GOT TINY HANDS. LIKE, YEAH. YEAH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LITTLE EGG BEATER HANDS. YEAH! AND THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT YOU. THESE MEN BOUGHT THIS CABANA TO PROJECT AN IMAGE OF WEALTH. BUT GIRLS, THESE GUYS DON'T HAVE MONEY. THESE GUYS FLEW HERE LAST MINUTE, MIDDLE SEAT, C GROUP, THE HOT ONE BROUGHT HIS CLOTHES IN A GARBAGE BAG. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HIS OBJECTIVE BEING TO GET YOU AWAY FROM THE HERD TO BRING YOU BACK TO HIS JUNIOR SUITE THAT HE'S SHARING WITH EIGHT OTHER GROWN MEN ON THE GROUND LEVEL OF THE HOTEL. THESE GUYS CAN'T AFFORD THIS CABANA. THEY BOUGHT IT TOGETHER. IT'S NOT LIKE ONE OF THEM COULD BUY THE CABANA. IT'S NOT LIKE JOEY HAD A GOOD YEAR POURING CONCRETE. THESE GUYS -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THESE MEN POOLED THEIR MONEY, LADIES, POOLED THEIR MONEY LIKE A VILLAGE BUYING A GOAT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY WANT YOU. AND EVEN THOUGH, AS A WOMAN, YOU KNOW THESE GUYS ARE NOT RIGHT FOR YOU, YOU KNOW THAT THESE MEN ARE HOT GARBAGE FIRE, SOME PART OF YOU STILL WANTS THEM, AND WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THIS. BEFORE THE AGE OF 25, YOUR GIRLFRIENDS WON'T LET YOU GO WITH HIM. BEFORE THE AGE OF 25, WOMEN HAVE THIS MISS ILL INFORMED TAYLOR SWIFTIAN NOTION OF SISTERHOOD. WE WILL DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT OUR OWN. LIKE YOU CAN'T HAVE STACY. WE WILL FORM A PHALANX AROUND HER LIKE, NO, STACY. NO, STACY. [ LAUGHTER ] THE SUBTEXT OF, YOU CAN'T HAVE HER IS, OF COURSE, BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT ME, BUT THAT'S A A WHOLE OTHER TED TALK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO THE WOMEN HERE IS, ENJOY THE SOVEREIGNTY OF YOUR YOUTH, BECAUSE AFTER 30, IT'S DIFFERENT. AFTER 30, GUESS WHAT, CHICKENS? YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. AFTER 30, YOUR GIRLFRIENDS DON'T CARE IF YOU DIE. LISTEN TO ME. SHIVERING ALONE IN A FOREST. AFTER 30, YOUR SEX LIFE BECOMES OUR ENTERTAINMENT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AFTER 30, WE'RE GOING TO BE LIKE, GO WITH HIM! WE WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU.
