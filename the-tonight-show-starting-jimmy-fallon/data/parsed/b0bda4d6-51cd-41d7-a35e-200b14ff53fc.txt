THEN BERNIE SANDERS SAID, "IS EVERYONE AS TURNED ON AS I AM RIGHT NOW?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S THE FIRST NBA TITLE AND THE FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP FOR CLEVELAND IN 52 YEARS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WOW. AND NOW A LOT OF SPORTS WRITERS ARE SAYING THAT CLEVELAND WILL NO LONGER BE SYNONYMOUS WITH LOSING. THEN THE CLEVELAND BROWNS SAID "NO, WE'RE STILL HERE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO DON'T WORRY. WE GOT IT COVERED. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE GOT YOU COVERED, BUDDY." OF COURSE, LAST NIGHT WAS ALSO ANOTHER BIG EPISODE OF "GAME OF THRONES." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT I HEARD THAT HBO'S STREAMING SERVICE, "HBO NOW," WENT DOWN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOW. BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, AT LEAST IT GUARANTEED THAT KIDS CALLED THEIR DAD ON FATHER'S DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE LIKE, "HEY, DAD, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE HBO ACCOUNT?

[ LAUGHTER ] AND WILL MAKE A GREAT RUNNING MATE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, THERE'S -- I MEAN, THAT'S -- HE CAN'T RUN WITH HIMSELF SO -- THIS IS PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL. POPE FRANCIS RECENTLY SAID THE MAJORITY OF MODERN CATHOLIC MARRIAGES ARE WORTHLESS BECAUSE COUPLES DON'T ALWAYS MEAN IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY'LL LOVE EACH OTHER FOREVER. AND THAT'S THE LAST TIME POPE FRANCIS WAS EVER ASKED TO GIVE A BEST MAN SPEECH. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GO, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN? [ APPLAUSE ] ARE YOU DRINKING? WHAT'S" -- THIS KIND OF MADE ME LAUGH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH DODGERS ANNOUNCER VIN SCULLY. HE'S A LEGEND. [ CHEERS ] HE'S A LEGEND. BEEN IN THE BROADCAST BOOTH FOR OVER 60 YEARS, SO HE'S SORT OF EARNED THE RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT WHATEVER HE WANTS. BUT LISTEN TO HIS CALL DURING FRIDAY'S GAME.

I'M GONNA TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM.
Jimmy: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE. HE'S HAVING -- SPEAKING OF, YEAH. IT REMINDS ME OF A COUPLE SCENES FROM THE MOVIE, "THE SHALLOWS."
YOU CAN TELL I'M A GOOD PARENT, RIGHT?
Jimmy: NO, THIS IS MORE -- HE'S -- [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE MOVIE -- THE MOVIE IS GOOD. THE MOVIE'S SCARY. THRILLING.
YES.
Jimmy: I AM AFRAID OF SHARKS. A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE AFRAID OF SHARKS. I PUT MYSELF IN YOUR POSITION AND WHEN I SEE YOU, I SEE MYSELF. [ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS GETTING SO MUCH CREEPIER. THIS WHOLE INTERVIEW.
Jimmy: YOU DROVE -- YOU DRIVE IN THE WHOLE MOVIE HERE. THIS IS JUST YOU ON A ROCK. IT'S JUST YOU. AND A LITTLE SEAGULL.
YEAH, SULLY.
Jimmy: SULLY. HE COMES DOWN IN AND PERCHES NEXT TO YOU. OH, NO. YOU'LL LOVE IT. IT'S LIKE -- IT'S A MIXTURE OF LIKE "JAWS" AND "CASTAWAY." MORE "JAWS." BUT MAN, OH, MAN. YOU GO, WHAT WOULD I DO? 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN TO THE BEACH SOMETIMES WHERE PEOPLE ARE WALKING. THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU.
YEAH. WELL, WHAT'S SO SCARY ABOUT IT TO ME IS YOU IMAGINE SHARK ATTACKS HAPPENING DEEP IN THE OCEAN BUT IT'S ALMOST SCARIER THAT IT'S THAT CLOSE TO SHORE. THAT IT'S IN SHALLOW WATERS. BECAUSE HOPE IS RIGHT THERE.

Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK TO THE SHOW, COME ON.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: I HAVEN'T SEE YOU IN A WHILE. BEFORE WE GET INTO THE INTERVIEW, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU QUICKLY HOW GREAT I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN "THE SKELETON TWINS."
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU WERE UNBELIEVABLE. I GO, "OH, MY GOD." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I GO, "LUKE WILSON, PLEASE GET HIM ON THE SHOW SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT."
THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE FANTASTIC. I HEARD THAT YOU HAVE A BOOK FOR ME.
YEAH, I DO. I WAS LOST AND I -- NOT PERSONALLY LOST, I WAS LOST IN THIS CANADIAN NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I WANDERED INTO THIS SELF-HELP BOOK STORE AND SAID --
Jimmy: YOU'RE LIKE, "HELP ME, I'M LOST."
THIS IS TRUE.
Jimmy: THE SELF-HELP BOOK STORE.
AND I CAME ACROSS THIS -- IT WAS LIKE A NEW-AGE BOOK STORE, YOU KNOW, LIKE, WITH CRYSTALS AND PRAYER BOOKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. OF COURSE, SURE.
BUT I CAME ACROSS THIS BOOK, AND THE GUY REMINDED ME OF YOU. MAYBE YOU --
Jimmy: NOT BAD ACTUALLY -- [ LAUGHTER ]
REALLY, I'VE BEEN CARRYING THIS THING AROUND --
Jimmy: HE'S NOT BAD. HE'S A GOOD LOOKING GUY.
I'VE BEEN CARRYING THIS THING AROUND FOR A YEAR NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DOES THAT WORK? HE'S A GOOD LOOKING MAN.
HE'S GREAT, YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS A VERY SMALL BOOK.
IT'S A VERY SMALL BOOK.
Jimmy: I LIKE THIS. WHAT IS IT --
OUT OF ALL THE CONTRABAND I HAVE IN MY HOME, I'M GLAD TO HAVE THIS OUT OF THERE, SO I BRING THAT AS A GIFT TO YOU.
Jimmy: FOR ME? HAS IT HELPED YOU?
YEAH.
Jimmy: HAVE YOU READ IT?
I HAVE HAD TO READ IT A A COUPLE TIMES. JUST, KIND OF, WHEN I RUN OUT OF SPORTS ILLUSTRATED AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE, YEAH.
HERE'S ONE ON -- "SMILE AT FEAR." IS A GOOD ONE.
Jimmy: OOH, SMILE AT FEAR?
SMILE AT IT, YEAH. NOT WITH IT, BUT AT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] REALLY.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THEN THERE'S ONE CALLED "REAL HUMILITY." I HAVEN'T READ THAT YET. [ LAUGHTER ] NO INTEREST.
Jimmy: NO INTEREST IN THAT, YEAH.
"WIND HORSE" IS A GOOD ONE.
Jimmy: "WIND HORSE."
YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, MAN.
YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A SHOT OR --
Jimmy: SURE.
OR "SMILE AT FEAR"?
Jimmy: I'LL DO "SMILE AT FEAR," SURE.
OKAY, WAIT. I'VE GOT TO FIND IT.
Jimmy: "WIND HORSE." I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, I LOST IT. HERE'S "SMILE AT FEAR."
Jimmy: OKAY, HERE WE GO. LET ME JUST SAY TO EVERYBODY, WHEN YOU'RE FRIGHTENED BY SOMETHING, YOU HAVE TO RELATE WITH FEAR, EXPLORE WHY YOU'RE FRIGHTENED, AND DEVELOP SOME SENSE OF CONVICTIONS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT FEAR. THEN FEAR SEES IT TO BE THE DOMINANT SITUATION THAT IS GOING TO DEFEAT YOU. FEAR CAN BE CONQUERED. YOU CAN BE FREE FROM FEAR IF YOU REALIZE FEAR IS NOT THE OGRE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO STOP THERE.
YEAH, GOOD JOB. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: FEAR IS NOT THE OGRE. I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR YEARS.
NICE JOB.
Jimmy: FEAR IS NOT AN OGRE.
I'VE BEEN ACTUALLY SAYING THAT FOR YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH, FEAR IS NOT THE OGRE. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT "ROADIES", BECAUSE -- GOSH, I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS. BECAUSE I JUST SAID EARLIER I LOVE YOU, BUT I ALSO LOVE THE MAN WHO DEVELOPED AND CREATED THIS, CAMERON CROWE -- ONE OF THE BEST WRITER-DIRECTORS OF OUR GENERATION. HE'S THE BEST. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE HIM, LOVE HIM, LOVE HIM SO MUCH, AND J.J. ABRAMS TOO. J.J. ABRAMS, I MEAN, YEAH, YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD A COUPLE LITTLE MOVIES HE DID AS WELL.
I REALLY LIKE TO WORK WITH OVERACHIEVERS.
Jimmy: REALLY? OH, GOSH. HOW IS CAMERON DOING? I LOVE CAMERON CROWE.
I MEAN, YOU WERE IN "ALMOST FAMOUS", RIGHT?
Jimmy: I WAS IN THERE A A LITTLE BIT.
PLAYING A TOUR MANAGER.
Jimmy: A TOUR MANAGER.
YOU HAVE THAT -- YOU DO THAT GREAT IMITATION OF MICK JAGGER.
Jimmy: BUT HE DOES DRAW EMOTION OUT OF YOU. HE'S THE BEST DIRECTOR IN THE WORLD.
YEAH, HE'S REALLY GOOD. HE STARTED OUT -- THE MOVIE "ALMOST FAMOUS" WAS BASED ON HIM. SO HE STARTED OUT AS A A JOURNALIST WHEN HE WAS JUST A A TEENAGER. BUT YEAH, HE ALWAYS KIND OF --
Jimmy: WELL, HE PICKS UP ON THINGS. IF YOU TELL HIM SOMETHING, YOU JUST HAPPEN TO SAY, LIKE, "OH, I LOVE THIS" --
ONE TIME I HAD GOTTEN HOOKED ON THIS STUFF, BULLET COFFEE, FOR LIKE --
Jimmy: ME TOO!

Jimmy: MAYBE I WAS DRINKING THE WRONG THING. [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT ANYWAYS --
Jimmy: I WAS PUTTING LAND-O-LAKES BUTTER IN A A BLENDER WITH COFFEE, GOING, "BULLET PROOF."
YEAH. I WAS PITCHING IT TO CAMERON ONE MORNING SAYING, "YOU'VE GOT TO TRY THIS STUFF." I WAS ALSO COMPLETELY WHACKED ON IT WHEN I WAS PITCHING IT TO HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I WAS PROBABLY, LIKE, A A LITTLE TOO CLOSE, AND HE WAS ACTUALLY WRITING STUFF DOWN. I WAS LIKE, "THIS IS GREAT. THE GUY'S WRITING DOWN THE RECIPE." AND THEN, A FEW WEEKS LATER, IT SHOWED UP IN A SCRIPT FOR MY CHARACTER, WHEN MY CHARACTER'S KIND OF, LIKE, LOSING HIS MIND A LITTLE BIT. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS, LIKE, "WHAT IS THIS? THIS IS NOT FUNNY."
Jimmy: I WAS POURING MY HEART OUT.
I WAS TRYING TO -- I TRUSTED YOU, MAN.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S GREAT. IT'S GOOD. IT'S IN THE SCRIPT. YOU'RE A CRAZY PERSON.
HOW DARE YOU? HOW DARE YOU? THAT'S MY LIFE.
Jimmy: TAKES YOUR LIFE AND FLIPS IT BACK ON YOU, MAN -- WHICH IS CHAPTER TEN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TAKING YOUR LIFE AND FLIPPING IT BACK ON YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT.
