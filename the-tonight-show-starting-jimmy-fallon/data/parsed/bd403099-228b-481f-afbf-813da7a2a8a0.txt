WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. YOU MADE IT, YOU'RE HERE, THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CAN YOU FEEL IT? WELCOME, IT'S GOING TO BE FUN. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THE WHITE HOUSE JUST ANNOUNCED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL ATTEND A SUMMIT IN KENYA THIS JULY. WHEN ASKED IF HE'S EVER BEEN TO KENYA, OBAMA WAS LIKE, OF COURSE, I WAS BOR -- I WAS BORED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I WAS BORED, THERE'S NOTHING TO DO, SO I WAS BORED THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, THIS SUMMER, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL ATTEND A A SUMMIT IN KENYA. WHEN ASKED WHY, OBAMA WAS LIKE "JUST TO [ BLEEP ] WITH REPUBLICANS." [ LAUGHTER ] REPUBLICANS AREN'T HAPPY. IN FACT, YESTERDAY, FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR JOHN SUNUNU SAID THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS JUST ASKING FOR CRITICISM BY GOING TO KENYA. THEN OBAMA WAS LIKE "OH, NUNU YOU DIDN'T." [ LAUGHTER ] I DID. AND IN A RECENT ARTICLE, A A WHITE HOUSE AIDE WHO TRAVELS WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS THEY HAVE TO OFTEN ENTER THE HOTEL THROUGH THE SERVICE ENTRANCE. BECAUSE WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THE FRONT, BIDEN ALWAYS GETS STUCK IN THE REVOLVING DOOR. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GETTING SICK, I'M GETTING SICK. I'M GETTING SICK, GUYS. I'M GOING TO THROW UP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ RETCHING SOUNDS ] SPEAKING OF BIDEN, HE WAS GIVING A SPEECH YESTERDAY AND TALKED ABOUT THE FIRST TIME HE EVER VISITED THE SENATE GYM. I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE SHARED A A LITTLE TOO MUCH INFORMATION. CHECK IT OUT.
LIKE IN A YMCA, THE MEN WALK AROUND BETWEEN THE SHOWER AND THE STALLS WITH NOTHING ON. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I REMEMBER HIM WALKING IN AND SAYING, "JOE, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET JACK JAVITZ." [ LAUGHTER ] I REMEMBER GOING, "HOW ARE YOU?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: OH!
Jimmy: WEAK GRIP. WE GOT WEAK GRIP, THAT GUY, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: THAT'S NOT A GYM BAG. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ANOTHER STORY -- THAT WAS JIM'S BAG. YEAH, YEAH IT WAS. AND GET THIS, ACCORDING TO A A NEW POLL, REPUBLICANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A DOUGHNUT FOR BREAKFAST, WHILE DEMOCRATS PREFER TO EAT BAGELS AND CROISSANTS. WHILE INDEPENDENTS ARE THAT ANNOYING FRIEND THAT'S STILL LOOKING AT THE MENU AFTER 15 MINUTES. [ LAUGHTER ] PUMPKIN PANCAKES LOOK GOOD. NO, YEAH, NO. MM, CRAB FRITTATAS? [ LAUGHTER ] THIS ISN'T GOOD HERE. GUYS, APPARENTLY BEFORE LAST YEAR'S G20 SUMMIT, AUSTRALIAN OFFICIALS SENT THE PASSPORT INFORMATION OF 31 WORLD LEADERS TO THE WRONG PEOPLE BECAUSE OF A MICROSOFT OUTLOOK ERROR. [ LAUGHTER ] MICROSOFT OUTLOOK, YEAH. THE TIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HERE AND AUSTRALIA IS APPARENTLY 15 YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] OUTLOOK? MICROSOFT OUTLOOK. [ APPLAUSE ] OH, LISTEN TO THIS. I READ THAT SOME PARENTS ARE EMBRACING A NEW APPROACH TO "THE TALK" WITH THEIR CHILDREN. WHICH ENCOURAGES HUMOR AND HONESTY. PARENTS SAY IT'S BETTER TO TREAT SEX AS COMEDY RATHER THAN THE TRAGEDY IT REALLY IS. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, THIS IS PRETTY COOL. TWO STUDENTS AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY CREATED A DEVICE THAT PUTS OUT FIRES USING LOW FREQUENCY SOUND WAVES. EXPLAINS THAT NEW SAYING, "STOP, DROP AND PUT ON SOME BARRY WHITE." [ BARRY WHITE PLAYING ] ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYBODY OUT, IT'S A FIRE! ♪♪ IT'S A FIRE! GRAB THE CHAMPAGNE, GRAB THE STRAWBERRIES! ♪♪ LET'S GO, WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!

[ LAUGHTER ] AMAZON JUST ANNOUNCED, DID YOU HEAR THIS? THAT CERTAIN CITIES CAN NOW USE THIS HOME SERVICES FEATURE. YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? IT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO GO ONLINE AND HIRE PEOPLE TO DO HOUSEHOLD CHORES. YOU WANT TO SEE HOW THAT TURNS OUT, TUNE IN TO "DATELINE" THIS FRIDAY ON NBC. [ LAUGHTER ] CHECK THIS OUT, ACCORDING TO A A NEW STUDY, THE MARIJUANA IN COLORADO IS ALMOST TWICE AS STRONG AS IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, PEOPLE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE SCIENTISTS. MAINLY, "HOW CAN WE GET YOUR JOB?" [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DOES ONE GET THAT JOB? "YEAH, IT'S PRETTY STRONG." [ LAUGHTER ] SOMEONE PAID YOU FOR THAT? OH YEAH, I'M AND EXPERT.
Steve: TWICE AS STRONG AS IT USED TO BE.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, I HEARD THAT TACO BELL IS REPLACING THE WAFFLE TACO WITH ITS NEW BISCUIT TACO. WHICH IS A TACO SHAPED BISCUIT FILLED WITH EGGS, SAUSAGE OR CHICKEN. THAT STORY AGAIN, WEED IS TWICE AS STRONG AS IT USED TO BE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY FUN. ANYWAYS, AND THEN WE HAVE GREAT MUSIC FROM -- ALT-J IS GOING TO BE HERE TONIGHT. VERY GOOD, ALT-J.
Steve: COME ON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I HAVE AN INTERESTING STORY. I THINK IT'S INTERESTING. LIKE MY OWN FATHER, WHO SERVED IN THE NAVY. MY FATHER-IN-LAW SERVED IN THE MARINE CORPS. AND I HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM, 1961. LOOK AT THAT, HE'S A STUD. YEAH, AND SO -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, YEAH. HE'S A GOOD MAN, HE'S A STUD. I'M IN -- LAST TIME, I'M IN LONDON, I WAS WALKING AROUND THERE LAST SUMMER. AND I WALKED BY THIS STORE, AND IT HAD A -- IT LOOKED LIKE A -- ALMOST LIKE AN ELECTRIC CHAIR OR SOMETHING IN THE WINDOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. I WAS WITH MY FRIEND, I GO "HEY, LET'S GO CHECK OUT THIS WATCH PLACE." I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. IT'S CALLED BRAYMONT WATCHES OR SOMETHING. I NEVER HEARD OF IT. I WENT IN, I GO, "WHAT IS THIS THING?" HE GOES -- [ BRITISH ACCENT ] IT'S ACTUALLY AN EJECTION SEAT. AND IT'S A MARTIN BAKER EJECTION SEAT. I GO, OH, I SAW. EVERYTHING WAS VERY -- TALKING ABOUT PLANES AND STUFF LIKE THIS, THIS WATCH COMPANY. I GO IN AND I JUST WANT TO LOOK AT IT, I GO "BEAUTIFUL." WE ACTUALLY SELL A MARTIN BAKER SPECIAL EDITION WATCH. I GO, OH, VERY COOL. I THINK HE'S TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING. HE GOES, CAN I SEE IT, IT HAS THIS COOL RED BAND. "VERY SPECIAL, VERY RARE, BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT CAN BUY THIS ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EJECTED FROM PLANES." I GO, OH WELL, THAT COUNTS ME OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I GO, I THINK MY FATHER-IN-LAW ACTUALLY EJECTED FROM A PLANE. WELL I KNOW HE DID, I DON'T THINK -- AND HE GOES, "DO YOU KNOW IF IT WAS A MARTIN BAKER?" IT NEVER CAME UP. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I GO, I CALLED MY WIFE, I GO "WILL YOU ASK YOUR DAD IF HE -- WHEN HE EJECTED, WAS IT A A MARTIN BAKER EJECTION SEAT." I DON'T KNOW. SO, SHE CALLS ME BACK, HE SAID "YES, HE SAID HE'S NUMBER 228." I GO TO THE GUY, "SHE SAID YES, HIS NUMBER'S 228, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?" HE GOES, THAT'S THE TIE CLUB NUMBER. SO THE THING IS, IT'S CALLED A A TIE CLUB. SO I GUESS IF YOU EJECT FROM A A PLANE AND YOU SURVIVE. YOU JOIN -- YOU'RE IN A SPECIAL CLUB, AND THEY SEND YOU A TIE. THIS IS THE TIE THEY SEND YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] AND THEY SEND YOU THIS TIE. AND THEY SAID, IN THE LETTER. IN THE LETTER, IT SAYS, IT'S A A FORMAL LETTER, AND IT SAYS, "ADDITIONAL TIES WILL BE PROVIDED WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF MAKING ADDITIONAL EJECTIONS." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S VERY FUNNY. SO ANYWAYS, I CALL MY FATHER-IN-LAW, I SAID, LOOK, I'LL SPRING FOR THE WATCH, BUT I NEED YOUR TIE CLUB NUMBER AND YOU TO GET THE WATCH. HE'S LIKE, "PERFECT." HE PROCEEDS TO TELL ME THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. IT WAS A TRAINING MISSION. IT'S OVER THE MOJAVE DESERT, IT WAS AROUND THERE. SPECIAL SECRET THING CALLED THE CHOCOLATE MOUNTAINS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND HE'S IN THIS TRAINING MISSION, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HIS PLANE STARTS GOING OUT OF CONTROL. TO FIX IT, HE HAS TO PULL -- I MEAN, THIS IS ME TALKING. HE HAS TO DO THIS THING WITH ONE OF HIS WINGS, AND THAT WOULD FIX IT. THE THING IS BROKEN. SO IT DOESN'T WORK. SO ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE STARTS GOING INTO A TAILSPIN. SO HE'S SPINNING AROUND. I GO, WHAT DO YOU THINK THEN? I WOULD IMMEDIATELY GO, THAT'S IT, MY LIFE'S OVER. BUT HE GOES, "YOU LOOK AT THE ALTIMETER." YOU SEE -- THAT'S THE ONLY THING YOU CAN LOOK AT, IF YOU LOOK OUTSIDE, EVERYTHING'S SPINNING AROUND. HE LOOKS AT THE ALTIMETER AND HE SEES THE NUMBER GOING DOWN, HE'S LIKE GOING TO CRASH. SO HE TRIES SOMEHOW, LIFTS UP IF HE CAN TO GET TO 20,000 FEET AND JUST, EJECTION. HE PULLS THE EJECTION SEAT. SO HE DOES THE EJECTION, AND WHEN THEY COME FIND HIM, HE ACTUALLY SNUCK THE RIP CORD INTO HIS FLIGHT SUIT. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GIVE IT AS EVIDENCE. BUT HE'S LIKE "SCREW IT, I ALMOST DIED." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE REAL THING. FROM 1961 AND YOU CAN STILL FEEL, IT'S STILL TOUGH. AND IT'S PRETTY RAD, IT'S PRETTY COOL. BUT ANYWAYS, HE SURVIVED, HE DID IT, AND -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO, I GOT THE WATCH. AND THE WATCH ON THE BACK IS ENGRAVED WITH HIS CALL NAME, WHICH IS COSMO, THAT'S THE DATE THAT HE 1961, THAT'S THE DATE AND HIS TIE CLUB NUMBER, 228. AND HERE'S THE WATCH WITH THE RED BAND. THIS IS IT, RIGHT HERE, BRAYMONT WATCH, THE RED BAND ON THE SIDE. AND HE DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GOING TO DO THIS, BUT HE'S HERE TONIGHT, AND SO I'D JUST LIKE TO GIVE HIM THE WATCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LOOK AT THAT TIE. I LOVE YOU, BUDDY. HERE YOU GO, PAL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR DAUGHTER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

REALLY?
Jimmy: WELL, YOU ARE. [ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN ME.
Jimmy: NO. I DON'T KNOW.
I REALLY DO.
Jimmy: DO YOU REMEMBER RUNNING INTO ME, THIS IS A TRUE STORY, ON THE STREET AND I WAS WEARING A FUNNY -- DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?
YOU WERE WEARING THE "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" JACKET.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THE GUY'S WORRIED HE'S NOT GOING TO GET RECOGNIZED. HE'S WALKING DOWN THE STREET, HE'S GOT A GIANT THING, "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" ON THE BACK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO. THIS IS THE MOST EMBARRASSING -- THIS IS A TRUE STORY, BUT IT'S EMBARRASSING. BUT, YEAH, LET ME TELL IT.
OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT WAS MY FIRST SEASON ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" AND I WAS A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW EVEN BEFORE I WAS ON IT. I JUST LOVED "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." SO THE FACT THAT I'M ON IT, I'M FREAKING OUT, SO I ORDER A A SPECIAL LEATHER JACKET, AND I HAD THEM WRITE "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" LIKE ON THE FRONT AND ON THE BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS SO PSYCHED.
AND HE'S WALKING AROUND THE STREETS OF NEW YORK. IT LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE, IT LOOKS LIKE THE EGO WAS A LITTLE HURTING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU WANTED TO SIGN SOME AUTOGRAPHS.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GOING TO RUN INTO ETHAN HAWKE, I GO --
I KNOW. I KNOW. I USED TO WALK AROUND ON BAD DAYS WITH MY "DEAD POET SOCIETY" CREW JACKET. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW? THAT WAY IF I FEEL BAD, PEOPLE COME UP TO ME, "CARPE DIEM, ETHAN!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO. THERE YOU GO. NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE RECOGNIZE YOU. HUH, BUDDY? YEAH.
HAVE YOU BEEN WEARING THE JACKET? OR DID I CALL YOU OUT?
Jimmy: NO, I HAVEN'T WORN IT SINCE. I HAVEN'T WORN IT SINCE. I STILL HAVE IT.
I THINK YOU SHOULD SEND IT TO ME. BECAUSE I COULD WEAR IT.
Jimmy: YEAH! WOULD YOU?
I WAS NEVER ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."
Jimmy: OH, THAT'D BE GREAT FOR YOU TO WEAR. AND YOU SEND ME THE "DEAD POET SOCIETY" JACKET, I'LL WEAR THAT.
NO, NO. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOT TO KEEP THAT.
Jimmy: I ALWAYS BRING THAT UP. I ALWAYS BRING UP YOUR OTHER MOVIES AS WELL. BUT "DEAD POET SOCIETY" WAS OF COURSE, "OH, CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN." I MEAN, EVERYTHING WAS JUST, GOSH. YOU WERE JUST FANTASTIC IN THAT FILM.
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU DID WHEN ROBIN PASSED WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. YOU SEE HE'S, HE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT GUY. WHAT A GREAT HUMAN BEING. WASN'T HE FUN?
LOOK, HE GOT ME MY FIRST AGENT. CAN YOU IMAGINE?
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH. HE WAS A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL SOUL. AND WE GOT TO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE, WHICH WAS ABOUT TEACHING YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT HOW TO LIVE. AND I GOT TO PLAY THAT PART AS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE, SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE ON SOMEBODY.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. DO YOU REMEMBER AUDITIONING FOR THAT?
OF COURSE I REMEMBER AUDITIONING FOR IT. ARE YOU KIDDING? I REMEMBER BECAUSE -- IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT LIKE THIS, WITH THE COUCH AND A BUNCH OF OTHER GEEKS STANDING THERE. AND YOU'RE ALL WAITING, YOU ALL HAVE THE SIDES --
Jimmy: OH, YOU HAVE ALL THE LINES WRITTEN OUT, YOU GOT TO REHEARSE. WAS EVERYBODY UP FOR THE SAME ROLE? DO YOU KNOW?
I DON'T KNOW. THEY WERE ALL UP FOR DIFFERENT PARTS. BUT I WAS TRYING TO IGNORE THEM. I HAD A LIKE SONY WALKMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I LISTENED TO MY WALKMAN. I REMEMBER LISTENING TO "THE ANGELS WANNA WEAR MY RED SHOES."
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
ELVIS COSTELLO. SO, WHENEVER I SEE THAT MOVIE OR THINK ABOUT THAT. I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THAT SONG.
Jimmy: THE AUDITION, YEAH. SEE THAT'S HOW COOL YOU ARE. YOU ARE WALKING WITH A A WALKMAN -- [ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES ME PARTICULARLY COOL.
Jimmy: ME, I WOULD HAD A A T-SHIRT WITH "WEEKEND UPDATE." YOU KNOW LIKE, I'M FRIENDS WITH TINA FEY. YOU KNOW, LIKE THAT TYPE OF SHIRT. BOY, OH BOY. "BOYHOOD," YOU WERE HERE FOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON OUR SHOW. AND THEN, GOSH, YOU WERE NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR AND I WAS LIKE JUST SO -- I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M PROUD OF YOU, BECAUSE CLEARLY I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR --
DID THE PUPPIES -- DID YOU DO THE PUPPIES FOR THE OSCARS?
Jimmy: YEAH.
THEY DIDN'T PICK ME? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SORRY, I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO WIN SOMEWHERE. EVEN PUPPIES BLEW ME OFF.
Jimmy: NO, I'M SORRY. YEAH. BUT YOU WERE, NO, YOU WERE GRACIOUS.
WELL, YOU KNOW MY THEORY ABOUT THE OSCARS IS WIN-WIN. BECAUSE IF YOU WIN, YOU WIN, BUT EVERYBODY SECRETLY HATES YOU.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO IF YOU LOSE, YOU LOSE, THAT'S A DIRECT -- BUT EVERYBODY'S SECRETLY HAPPY FOR YOU. YOU KNOW, LIKE, EVERYWHERE I WALK AROUND THEY GO, "HEY, MAN, YOU SHOULD HAVE WON." YOU KNOW, OR, "YOU WERE ROBBED." YOU GET ALL THIS GOOD WILL. AND IF YOU WON, LET'S FACE IT, YOU DON'T GET ANY GOOD WILL.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. NO. BUT YOU -- I MEAN, GOSH, WHEN YOU MAKE THOSE MOVIES, YOU'RE NOT MAKING THEM TO GO UP AGAINST -- YOU DON'T KNOW "WHIPLASH" IS GOING TO COME OUT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. WHEN YOUR WHEN MAKING --
NO, YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVIE LIKE "BOYHOOD" EVEN THINKING LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE YOU MADE THAT MOVIE.
THAT MOVIE SURPASSED OUR WILDEST EXPECTATIONS. I MEAN, JUST BEING -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'LL TELL YOU, I WAS THERE WITH ELLAR COLTRANE AND THE WHOLE GANG, WE ALL JUST FELT LIKE WE WERE CRASHING THAT PARTY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, WE HAD SUCH A A GREAT TIME MAKING THAT MOVIE. THE MOVIE FELT SO SPECIAL. IT WASN'T A JOB, SO TO HAVE IT TAKE YOU TO THE BIG COTILLION WAS GREAT.
Jimmy: I MEAN THAT -- OF COURSE I WAS MAD AT YOU, BECAUSE YOU KEPT THIS SECRET FROM ME, AND I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS FOR 12 YEARS. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SECRETLY STARRING IN THIS AWESOME SECRET MOVIE WHERE EVERY YEAR YOUR GOING TO GROW UP.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW? YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, YOU.
Jimmy: "MANHOOD?" "MANHOOD."
IF IT WAS THAT EASY, YEAH.
Jimmy: GOD. NO, I MEAN, BUT ANOTHER "BEFORE SUNRISE," MAYBE?
MAYBE.
Jimmy: YEAH, SEE, YOU CAN FIGURE THINGS OUT. I'M A GIANT FAN, I'LL FIND OUT.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: NOW, THIS FILM, YOU DIRECTED A DOCUMENTARY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW THIS GUY, BEFORE I HAD SEEN YOUR DOCUMENTARY.
NO, WELL, HE WAS A FAMOUS CONCERT PIANO PLAYER ABOUT 40 YEARS AGO, AND HE DROPPED OUT TO DEDICATE THE SECOND HALF OF HIS LIFE TO TEACHING. I MET HIM AT THIS PARTY, AND HE WAS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL PERSON. I NEVER MET ANYBODY LIKE HIM. I FELT LIKE OTHER PEOPLE WOULD BE INTERESTED. SO, I STARTED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, I HAVE BEEN FILMING HIM, JUST TEACHING AND PLAYING MUSIC. AND HIS RELATIONSHIP, IT'S A A LITTLE BIT LIKE "ZEN AND THE ART OF ARCHERY" OR SOMETHING. LIKE THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT THE PIANO RELATES TO ALL OF LIFE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
OR THAT'S THE GOAL OF THE DOCUMENTARY.
Jimmy: I GOT THAT. I GOT THAT FROM THE -- IT WAS FANTASTIC, AND YOU FEEL VERY INTIMATE. IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE IN THIS APARTMENT OR WHEREVER HE'S TEACHING PIANO LESSONS AND THIS GUY IS LIKE --
HE'S BEAUTIFUL PERSON. SO, YEAH.
Jimmy: HE'S SO COOL, SO COOL TO WATCH HIM. SO GLAD YOU CAPTURED HIM ON -- AND HIS QUIRKINESS TOO BECAUSE HE GOES TO A STEINWAY, YOU KNOW THEY MAKE SOME OF THE BEST PIANOS THE WORLD. AND HE'S WALKING TO A STUDIO, LIKE 20 BABY GRANDS.
YEAH, AT LEAST 20.
Jimmy: RIGHT? AND HE'S GOING BY AND PLAYING, AND HE GOES, "THAT'S OKAY." AND HE GOES OUT TO ANOTHER ONE AND HE GOES, "THAT SOUNDS NICE." AND THEN HE'S PLAYING ANOTHER, HE GOES, "OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL." [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE'S JUST BARELY TOUCHING IT AND IT'S ALL ABOUT LIKE THE QUIETEST --
HE'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE YODA, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ LAUGHTER ]
BEAUTIFUL IT IS.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. YEAH. THAT WAS GOOD, YEAH. AND JUST -- IT'S SO, KIND OF REFRESHING TO SEE SOMEONE JUST GOING, YEAH, WALKING AWAY FROM SUCCESS AND GOING, "NO THIS IS -- I DON'T WANT TO -- I DON'T WANT TO BE A SUPERSTAR, I WANT TO MAKE MYSELF HAPPY. I WANT TO BE HAPPY."
WELL, I THINK WHAT'S POWERFUL ABOUT HIM, IS HE KNOWS THAT THE POINT OF LIFE IS NOT TO WIN. YOU KNOW, WE LIVE IN A CULTURE THAT'S ALWAYS TRYING TO TRICK EVERYBODY INTO THINKING THERE'S SOMETHING TO WIN. AND THAT YOUR LIFE IS HAPPENING ALL THIS TIME. AND IT'S HOW YOU LIVE IT, AND WHY YOU DO WHAT YOU DO. NOT THE RESULT OF IT. AND HE -- TO HEAR AN 88-YEAR-OLD PERSON WHO LOVES HIMSELF AND LOVES LIFE, AND HAS A GREAT LIFE SAY THAT, FEELS LIKE A RELIEF. TO ME IT DID, ANYWAY.
Jimmy: YEAH, BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY SAY IN THE FILM, YOU GO LIKE, "I'M STARTING TO -- THIS IS THE SECOND HALF OF MY LIFE. AND I'M GOING, WELL, WHAT AM I DOING THIS FOR? OR WHY AM I DOING WHAT I DO?" AND IT'S GREAT.
LIKE WITH "DEAD POET," I STARTED DOING THIS -- YOU KNOW, THE FIRST TIME I WAS ON A TALK SHOW LIKE THIS, I WAS 18 YEARS OLD. SO, YOU HIT 40 AND YOU START TO ASK YOURSELF THOSE QUESTIONS, ABOUT WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TALKING TO JIMMY FALLON OVER AND OVER AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
LIKE, "WHY AREN'T YOU MOVING ON?"
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, NO. I'M JUST SO PERSISTENT.
EXACTLY, YEAH.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS GREAT DOCUMENTARY, "SEYMOUR: AN INTRODUCTION" IS THE NAME OF IT. TAKE A LOOK.
I'M WALKING ON 76th STREET, TURNING THE PAGES PREPARING TO SEE THE WORST. IT WAS BY DONALD HANNAHAN. BOY, HE WAS SO TERRIBLE TO PIANIST. BUT HE GAVE ME A RAVE REVIEW. "SEYMOUR BERNSTEIN TRIUMPHS AT THE PIANO." MY FRIEND SHEILA ALDENDORF MADE A RECEPTION FOR ME.

Jimmy: WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. AND WELCOME BACK. FIRST TIME TO HAVE YOU ON.
YES, MY FIRST TIME. LAST TIME, IT WAS JUST THE BOYS.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND BOY IT WAS FUN. YOU MISSED OUT. IT WAS A GOOD ONE.
SI WAS HERE.
Jimmy: HOW'S UNCLE SI?
HE HASN'T -- HE'S BEEN COMPLAINING I'VE BEEN WORKING HIM TOO HARD. I DON'T THINK HE'S WORKED FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH. I'M SURE HE'S ASLEEP RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, THANKS. HE'S A BIG FAN. HE WATCHES EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. IN ADDITION TO RUNNING THE COMPANY, I SAW THAT YOU HAVE ANOTHER JOB, A NEW JOB. YOU'RE ALSO A -- YOU'RE ALSO DOING WEDDINGS?
YEAH. I'M -- I'VE BEEN HIRED A COUPLE OF TIMES. LOOK THERE, THAT WAS FOR MY GOOD FRIEND JASON. WE WERE DOWN IN MEXICO, AND I LOVE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ON THE BEACH. I MEAN, I WONDER WHAT THEY WERE THINKING, WHERE DID YOU GET THE HOMELESS GUY TO DO THE --
Jimmy: NO, NO.
I DON'T LOOK LIKE A A MINISTER, IS WHAT I'M --
Jimmy: NO YOU DON'T, BUT JASON ALDEAN'S JUST LIKE, "YEAH, CAN YOU PLEASE COME DO IT?"
YEAH, HE WANTED ME TO DO IT.
HE'S ACTUALLY DONE A FEW WEDDINGS, THIS WAS NOT HIS FIRST.
Jimmy: WHAT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: HE ALSO DOES KIDS PARTIES, TOO. IT WAS FANTASTIC.
I'M LIKE A --
Jimmy: REALLY. AND HOW -- YOU JUST CELEBRATED YOUR ANNIVERSARY, 23 YEARS?
23 YEARS. YES.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NOW, MY OLDEST, OUR OLDEST SON JOHN LUKE ASKED ME TO DO HIS WEDDING THIS SUMMER, SO I'M REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THAT. I HOPE I DON'T BALL THE WHOLE TIME.
YOU WILL.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A PRETTY EMOTIONAL GUY.
DID YOU SEE HIM WITH SADIE ON "DANCING WITH THE STARS?" HE CRIED EVERY WEEK.
Jimmy: I THINK WE SHOWED IT ON OUR SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS GREAT, YEAH. I HAVE A PHOTO OF YOU GUYS ON YOUR WEDDING DAY. CAN YOU RECOGNIZE THIS GUY? DO YOU REMEMBER HIM?
OOH! LOOK AT YOU.
Jimmy: YOU'RE LOOKING GORGEOUS. BUT WHO IS THIS GUY?
THAT WAS MY FIRST HUSBAND. [ LAUGHTER ] WILLIE. YES, THAT'S MY FIRST TEN YEARS OF MARRIAGE, THIS IS WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE. AND IN THE SECOND TEN YEARS, IT'S THIS. SO, I GET THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE MARRIED TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE. IS THIS WHEN YOU STARTED GROWING THE BEARD?
NO, SEE, IN ORDER TO ATTRACT THE RIGHT FEMALE, YOU HAVE TO LOOK LIKE THAT FOR A WHILE, AND THEN YOU CAN JUST LET IT ALL GO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE KEY. SEE, THAT'S THE KEY. HONEY, SHE'S IN THE AUDIENCE. WHERE DID YOU GUYS MEET? DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN?
SUMMER CAMP, THIRD GRADE.
Jimmy: NO WAY, THIRD GRADE? REALLY?
HE ASKED ME ON THE MOONLIGHT HIKE. HE WAS THE CUTEST THING, YOU SAW ALL THE DIMPLES. THEY'RE HIDDEN RIGHT NOW, BUT HE'S GOT THESE CUTE LITTLE DIMPLES AND HE ASKED ME ON THE HIKE, AND I ACTUALLY WROTE IT IN MY DIARY. YES.
Jimmy: WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I SAID, MET A CUTE BOY AT CAMP AND HE ASKED ME ON THE HIKE, AND --
SHE'S BEEN CHASING ME EVER SINCE.
Jimmy: WHAT DID YOU DO TO IMPRESS HER?
I DID ALL KINDS OF THINGS. I HAD ONE TRICK WHERE I WOULD -- YOU CAN'T SEE IT BECAUSE IT'S JAGGED, BUT JUST IMAGINE I WOULD BLOW ON MY THUMB AND MY MUSCLE WOULD POP UP AS I BLEW.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD TRICK.
HE USED TO WEAR, LIKE, TANK TOPS. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE WAS REALLY COOL. AND HAD THESE MUSCLES, SO YEAH.
ALSO, SHE WOULD COME OVER AND I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY COOL. I WOULD TAKE OUT MY FIST AND BUST OUT THE CEILING TILES IN MY ROOM. JUST SHOW HOW STRONG I WAS. YOU KNOW, THE MUSCLE PUMPED UP.
IMPRESSIVE.
Jimmy: VERY IMPRESSIVE, YEAH. THAT'S REALLY HARD.
I WOULD GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.
Jimmy: REALLY TOUGH GUY, "WHY DON'T YOU BREAK THIS COOLER IN PIECES." STYROFOAM. AND NOW, BUT LOOK AT THIS, WE WERE TALKING BACKSTAGE, ISN'T THIS COOL? YOU HAVE A SHOW, A MUSICAL BASED ON YOUR LIFE.
WE DO, IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S INSANE. I JUST GOT BACK FROM VEGAS, I WAS WATCHING REHEARSALS AND HELPING. I'M KIND OF THE HAIR COACH, THE DIALECT COACH. AND YOU KNOW, WATCH THE STORY TOO. IT'S PRETTY WEIRD.
MAKING SURE THE WIGS ARE JUST RIGHT, THE BEARDS ARE JUST RIGHT.
Jimmy: THEY LOOK JUST LIKE YOU, BUT LOOK. THIS IS THE ACTORS PLAYING YOU GUYS?
ISN'T THAT CRAZY?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Jimmy: I MEAN, THAT'S FANTASTIC. DID YOU WATCH AND GO, "I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE DOING US, HONEY, THIS IS OUR STORY."
IT'S PRETTY INSANE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR TWO YEARS, TO WATCH IT NOW ACTUALLY. THEY'VE HIT THE STAGE FOR THE FINAL REHEARSALS IN A COUPLE WEEKS, IT'S OPENING. IT'S STRANGE TO THINK OF WHERE WE CAME FROM TO NOW HAVE A A MUSICAL ABOUT OUR LIVES. IT'S WEIRD.
Jimmy: THAT'S REALLY FUN, YOU SAY SOME THINGS ON THE SHOW THAT I LIKE BECAUSE YOU JUST CUT TO THE CHASE. AND YOU CUT DOWN WORDS. YOUR DIALOGUE IS VERY QUICK. I WANTED TO GIVE A LESSON OUT THERE FOR EVERYONE ELSE..
THAT'S WHAT I HAD TO TEACH THE GUY PLAYING ME. BECAUSE HE'S COMING FROM NEW YORK. SO HE HAD NO IDEA HOW WE SAY THINGS.
Jimmy: SO FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU WANTED TO SAY. I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T CATCH THAT, COULD YOU JUST REPEAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID? YOU WOULD SAY.
YOU'D SAY, "DO WHAT?"
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. DO WHAT? IF A GUEST REVEALS SOMETHING SURPRISING, LIKE, A PLOT TWIST, AND I WANT TO SAY, I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
YOU'D SAY, "DAG GUM."
OR THE GIRL VERSION OF THAT WOULD BE "MY WORD."
Jimmy: OH REALLY, MY WORD. LAST ONE, IF I DON'T WANT A A GUEST TO COME BACK ON THE SHOW, I TELL MY PRODUCERS?
"HE GONE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE GONE. I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE MUSICAL. I KNOW IT'S SUPER FUN, WILLIE AND KORIE ROBERTSON, RIGHT THERE.
