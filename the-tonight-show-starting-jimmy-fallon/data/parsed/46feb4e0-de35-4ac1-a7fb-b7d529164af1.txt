YOU MADE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BIG SHOW, A A FUN SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. HILLARY CLINTON GOT A HUGE BOOST FOR HER CAMPAIGN YESTERDAY WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA RELEASED A VIDEO MESSAGE ENDORSING HER FOR PRESIDENT. HE SAID HE REACHED THE DECISION ENTIRELY ON HIS OWN, BUT THE VIDEO WAS FILMED IN HILLARY'S BASEMENT AND BEGAN WITH OBAMA HOLDING UP THAT DAY'S NEWSPAPER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "JUST READ WHAT'S ON THE PAPER!" THE VIDEO OF OBAMA ENDORSING HILLARY ALREADY HAS THOUSANDS OF VIEWS ONLINE. 17 IF YOU DON'T COUNT HILLARY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OBAMA ACTUALLY ENDORSED HILLARY JUST HOURS AFTER HE MET WITH BERNIE SANDERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BERNIE WAS IN TROUBLE WHEN HE LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT A ROSE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JOJO. NOW THAT HILLARY'S THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE, MANY DEMOCRATS ARE PRESSURING HER TO PICK A FEMALE RUNNING MATE FOR AN ALL-FEMALE TICKET. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] HILLARY WAS LIKE, "WELL, YEAH, LET'S SEE HOW THIS ALL-FEMALE 'GHOSTBUSTERS' DOES FIRST. THEN WE'LL" -- [ APPLAUSE ] BUT GET THIS. THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT WILL TAKE ABOUT 75 YEARS TO GO THROUGH THE EMAILS HILLARY SENT WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHILE IT WILL TAKE ABOUT 76 YEARS TO GET THROUGH ONE EMAIL WRITTEN BY MY MOM. IT'S JUST THAT -- "THEN AFTER THE MOVIE, WE WENT OUT TO EAT AND WE -- I HAD THE FISH. I NEVER HAVE FISH AT A A RESTAURANT. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T. IT SCARES ME. FISH SCARES ME." THAT'S ALL IN THE SUBJECT LINE, TOO. [ LAUGHTER ] OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, I READ DONALD TRUMP IS NOT EXPECTED TO MEET HIS FUNDRAISING GOAL OF $1 BILLION. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] UNLESS, OF COURSE, HE JUST FINDS IT IN HIS PANTS AFTER DOING LAUNDRY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE, "OH LOOK, A A $1 BILLION. I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS." WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON? [ LAUGHTER ] WHY DON'T THEY JUST MAKE THE PRIVATE PLANE OUT OF THE BLACK BOX?" [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT GOVERNOR --
