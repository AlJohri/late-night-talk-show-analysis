[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE OTHER CANDIDATES ARE REALLY EXCITED TO PRESENT THEIR VIEWS IN A SERIOUS YET RESPECTLE -- RESPECTFUL MANNER WHICH MEANS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD THAT NOBODY'S GOING TO WATCH THIS ONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TRUMP SAYS THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO THE FOX NEWS DEBATE BECAUSE MODERATOR MEGYN KELLY IS BIASED AGAINST HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] AND TRUMP HAS A RIGHT TO BE SCARED BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN A A YOUNGER ATTRACTIVE WOMAN DISAGREES WITH HIM, SHE ENDS UP TAKING HALF HIS STUFF. SO I MEAN THIS IS -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SEE WHY -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, THE OTHER CANDIDATES HAVE SOME PRETTY STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT TRUMP NOT BEING IN THE DEBATE. CHECK IT OUT. TED CRUZ SAID, "GOOD." [ LAUGHTER ] MARCO RUBIO SAID, "GOOD."

HIS OWNER SAYS HE LIKES GETTING HIS HAIR BRUSHED, EATING CARROTS, AND SHE JUST NOW REALIZED HE'S A HORSE. BUT NO BIG DEAL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? IT'S SOME TYPE OF NEWS, RIGHT? [ APPLAUSE ] FINALLY, AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, CAMPAIGN SEASON IS HEATING UP AND THE IOWA CAUCUSES ARE LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY.

Jimmy: HOW DID YOU EVEN -- HOW DID YOU PULL IT OFF? WHO KNEW THAT YOU WERE GOING?
WELL, WE DIDN'T TELL HBO.
Jimmy: GOOD FOR YOU.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS ARGUABLY THE FIRST PEOPLE WE SHOULD HAVE TOLD.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEY ENDED UP BEING THE LAST. BUT THEY WERE FINE WITH IT. SO, YEAH, I CALLED THEM AFTER WE GOT BACK AND SAID, I WAS IN RUSSIA, SURPRISE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I WAS IN RUSSIA, TALKING TO EDWARD SNOWDEN. AND THEY SAID, OKAY.
Jimmy: WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE IN --
IT FELT LIKE WE WERE IN TROUBLE ALL THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] IT GOT SO -- 'CAUSE I WAS EVEN WORRIED COMING BACK TO AMERICA WHETHER WE'D BE IN TROUBLE HERE. SO WE SPREAD THE CAMERA TAPES BETWEEN US AROUND OUR BODIES. IT FELT LIKE THE LAST SCENE OF "ARGO." [ LAUGHTER ] WITH ALL I WAS THINKING WAS ONCE THE WHEELS OF THE PLANE TAKE OFF, I THINK I'M SAFE. WHICH IS AN INFANTILE UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY.
Jimmy: OF COURSE. BUT MAN, OH, MAN IT WAS FANTASTIC.
IT WAS AMAZING. IT WAS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.
Jimmy: THE NEW SHOW -- THE NEW SEASON STARTS IN A FEW WEEKS, FEBRUARY 14th, 11:00 P.M.

YEAH.
Jimmy: GO --
GO [ BLEEP ] YOURSELF.
Jimmy: OKAY, YEAH.

Jimmy: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NOW, THAT'S NOT REALLY FROM CHER.
OH, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FROM CHER. BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS CHER'S TWITTER HANDLE IS A WORK OF ART. IF YOU EVER WANT TO KNOW WHAT CHER THINKS ABOUT ANYTHING AT ANY TIME OF THE DAY, LOOK AT HER TWITTER. SO WE HAD -- WE'VE DONE THIS JOKE ON THE SHOW ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA SAYING SOCIAL MEDIA, SOMETHING THAT CHER NEARLY UNDERSTANDS HOW TO USE BECAUSE SHE'S DONE SOME VERY DUMB -- IT'S BASICALLY, LOOK, YOU GOT IT HERE, THIS, THAT'S NOT HOW TWITTER WORKS.
Jimmy: WHAT IS IT?
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NEARLY -- THE THING IS THAT IS NEARLY HOW TWITTER WORKS.
Jimmy: PLEASE RE-TWEET!
SO CLOSE. SO WE DID THAT. WE MADE FUN OF HER. AND SO -- AND THAT WAS HER RESPONSE. GO [ BLEEP ] YOURSELF, YOU WEE RAT FACE.
Jimmy: THAT'S VERY, VERY NICE. AND THEN DONALD TRUMP SAID --
VERY BORING.
Jimmy: VERY BORING. YEAH, VERY BORING.
I DON'T THINK HE'S ENTIRELY WRONG ABOUT THAT.
Jimmy: NO, YEAH, BUT WHO IS THE MOST SURPRISING THING?
THE PRESIDENT OF ECUADOR, THE PRESIDENT OF ECUADOR SAYS I'M MORE UNPLEASANT THAN A A DIURETIC. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF ECUADOR, WHO TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO TWEET AT ME ACROSS ONE ANGRY MORNING SAYING THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NEVER BEEN A FUNNY ENGLISH COMEDIAN AND THAT I WAS, YEAH, I WAS BASICALLY AS UNPLEASANT AS A A DIURETIC. I CAN'T GO TO ECUADOR UNLESS I ONLY EVER WANT TO BE IN ECUADOR FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN GO. I JUST CAN'T LEAVE.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T GET OUT, EXACTLY. BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE A LOT OF FANS. AND YOU DON'T -- YOU HAVEN'T UPSET THAT MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A GREAT STORY ABOUT LL COOL J.
YEAH, SO, YOU KNOW LL COOL J, RIGHT?
Jimmy: I LOVE LL COOL J.
