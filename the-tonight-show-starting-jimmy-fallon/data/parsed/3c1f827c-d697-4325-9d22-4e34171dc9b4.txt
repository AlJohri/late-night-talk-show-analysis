WELL, A HANDFUL. THERE'S, LIKE, VERY SIMPLE SIX RECIPES.
Jimmy: YEAH. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUT SOME TYPE OF FOOD IN THERE, BECAUSE YOU ARE JUST -- YOU'VE JUST BEEN TOLD THAT YOU ARE A SUPER TASTER.
YES, YES. IT'S KIND OF LIKE BEING A DOG WHO CAN HEAR WHISTLES THAT WE CAN'T. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: KIND OF, YEAH. ONE WAY TO DESCRIBE IT.
WELL, I MEAN --
Jimmy: BUT YOU HAVE LIKE PERFECT TASTE BUDS? WHAT IS IT?
IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE EXTRA TASTE BUDS. BASICALLY -- AND I DIDN'T KNOW THIS UNTIL WE WERE FILMING "TOP CHEF" IN SEATTLE AND WE WERE AT THE SCIENCE MUSEUM. AND I TOOK MY DAUGHTER, KRISHNA, TO THE CHILDREN'S PART AND THERE WAS SORT OF THIS TASTE BUD BOOTH. AND SO I WENT UP THERE. I SAID, "YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE I COULD REALLY TASTE VERY SUBTLE THINGS." AND THE SCIENTIST SAID, "MAYBE YOU'RE A SUPER TASTER." I SAID, "IS THIS A REAL THING?" I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A MADE UP, IMAGINARY THING. AND SHE SAID, "NO, NO, I CAN TEST YOU AND SEE IF YOU'RE ONE." I SAID, "WILL IT HURT?" YOU KNOW, SHE SAID, "NO, NO." I SAID, "HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?" SHE'S LIKE, "I CAN DO IT RIGHT NOW." I SAID, "I DON'T HAVE TO GET UNDRESSED OR ANYTHING?" [ LAUGHTER ] "NO, IT'S FINE."
Jimmy: YOU COULD IF YOU WANT TO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.
SO, IT'S, LIKE BASICALLY A A LITTLE TAB TEST THAT THEY PUT ON YOUR TONGUE AND THEY DO ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT PIECES OF PAPER. IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF TAB.
Jimmy: YOU WENT TO BONNAROO. THAT'S WHAT YOU DID, YEAH. IT WAS THE BEST EXPERIENCE. YEAH.
AND IF YOU CAN TASTE BITTER NOTES THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN'T, THEN YOU HAVE EXTRA TASTE BUDS.
Jimmy: WOW.
AND SO I FOUND OUT THAT I DO. I HAVE EXTRA TASTE BUDS. I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE BEING ABLE TO HAVE X-RAY VISION OR ANYTHING, UNFORTUNATELY.
Jimmy: SOMETHING TO PUT ON THE RESUME.
THAT'S TRUE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
THAT IS TRUE.
Jimmy: THERE'S FUNNY STORIES IN HERE THAT MADE ME LAUGH. ONE IS A GOOD STORY IN HERE THAT SAYS YOU LEARNED A LOT FROM THIS SHOW YOU USED TO DO IN ITALY.
YEAH, MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS, BUT I ACTUALLY GOT MY START HOSTING ON ITALIAN TELEVISION. I WAS PART OF THE CAST OF A A LIVE VARIETY SHOW ON SUNDAY CALLED "DOMENICA IN." AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAD NO SCRIPT --
Jimmy: "DOMENICA IN"?
WHICH MEANS SUNDAY IN. SPENDING THE SUNDAY IN.
Jimmy: OH.
AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAD NO SCRIPT. IT WAS FLYING BY THE SEAT OF OUR PANTS. IT WAS ZANY. I MEAN, ONE TIME I CAME ON SET IN ROLLER SKATES. IT WAS JUST WILD.
Jimmy: AND SO I DID THAT LAST NIGHT. YEAH, IT'S SO WEIRD. IT'S A VARIETY SHOW.
YEAH, EXACTLY. SO, I MEAN, IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. AND YOU KNOW, I STUDIED SPANISH, BUT I NEVER REALLY STUDIED ITALIAN. I LEARNED ITALIAN FROM THE CAB DRIVERS IN ITALY. AND AS WE KNOW, CAB DRIVERS ARE VERY COLORFUL. SO, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THIS IS AN ITALIAN SHOW, WE ALSO BREAK IN FOR SOCCER REPORTS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. LIKE, BREAKING NEWS. YOU KNOW, MONTA BEATS -- YOU KNOW, WHATEVER. AND SO, THE MOST FAMOUS SPORTS CASTER'S NAME IS GALEAZZI. AND HE'S THIS HUGE -- IMAGINE IF JABBA THE HUTT WAS ITALIAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S OKAY. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. OKAY, SURE, SURE, SURE.
HE AND THE HEAD HOST, HIS NAME WAS FABRIZIO, WERE TEASING ME, AND BY ACCIDENT -- I THOUGHT I WAS CALLING HIM A A JERK, BUT IN ITALIAN, I SAID ANOTHER WORD WHICH MEANS, LITERALLY, A PIECE OF EXCREMENT.
Jimmy: OKAY. THANK YOU FOR COVERING.
ACTUALLY, GREG KINNEAR WAS JUST HERE AND I WAS LAUGHING, BECAUSE WE -- WE? THE ITALIANS HAVE A SHOW CALLED "BLOB" AND IT'S LIKE "TALK SOUP." AND SO THEY SHOW LITTLE SNIPPETS AND SOUND BITES FROM ALL THE TALK SHOWS ALL WEEK. AND BECAUSE I SAID THIS AND IT WENT ON AIR, HENCE NO TAPE DELAY, THEY BLOBBED ME ALL WEEK. SO THAT WAS BEFORE -- YEAH. I FELT LIKE I MADE IT.
Jimmy: YOU GOT BLOBBED!
I GOT BLOBBED.
Jimmy: YES! AND YOU DID MAKE IT, YEAH.
I DID MAKE IT.
Jimmy: LOOK AT YOU NOW, PAL.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: "NEW YORK TIMES" BEST-SELLER. WHO IS BLOBBING NOW, PALS? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. KISS THE BABY.
I SHALL.

BUT SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SAY IT, OKAY? I MEAN, COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU, SUCKERS? FROM THE MINUTE YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, THERE IT IS. CNN, FACEBOOK, TWITTER. THE VIOLENCE, THE MUD SLINGING. THIS CAMPAIGN IS DISGUSTING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, "BATMAN VERSUS SUPERMAN"? [ LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU KIDDING ME WITH THIS HERE NOW? BRUCE WAYNE? THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ON THE SAME POSTER. THERE IS NO COMPETITION HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THINK ABOUT IT. BRUCE WAYNE, BILLIONAIRE, BATMAN, BIG SHOT, RIGHT? SHOWS UP AT A LITTLE COSTUME PARTY WITH THE OUTFIT, THE LITTLE MASK WITH THE POINTY EARS. THE UTILITY BELT. [ LAUGHTER ] WITH A FLASHLIGHT AND A CHAIN LADDER AND SOME PEPPER SPRAY. WHAT'S HE SAY, WHAT'S HE SAY? "STOP, I'M GOING TO MACE YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] DRIVES AROUND, THIS GUY, RIGHT? DRIVES AROUND IN A LITTLE SOUPED-UP TRANS-AM WITH THE BIG RIMS. YOU COULD MEET THIS GUY AT ANY GAS STATION CHANGING OUT THE BATTERY WITH HIS LITTLE ASSISTANT, ROBIN. [ LAUGHTER ] SUPERMAN. THEY CALL SUPERMAN "SUPERMAN" BECAUSE HE'S A SUPER MAN. HE'S NOT FROM HERE, HE'S SUPER. HE JUMPS OFF A CLIFF, HE'S IN BANGKOK IN 30 SECONDS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GOING, "I'M OVER HERE NOW!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE COULD TAKE THE ENTIRE WORLD, RIGHT? HE COULD TAKE THE ENTIRE WORLD AND SPIN IT ON ONE FINGER LIKE A HARLEM GLOBETROTTER. ♪ DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA ♪ DADDY. COME ON. [ APPLAUSE ] IF HE HAS SEX -- IF HE HAS SEX WITH A WOMAN, HE KNOCKS HER EIGHT PLANETS AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] STARTS A NEW CIVILIZATION. HE'S THE MAN OF STEEL! HE LOOKS AT A PIPE, IT BENDS.

ANYONE THINKS THEY CAN KICK SUPERMAN'S ASS IS FULL OF -- IT. OH! [ APPLAUSE ] BUT I'LL TELL YOU, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE APPLAUSE. DON'T NEED 'EM. DICE DON'T NEED APPLAUSE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LET ME EXPLAIN THE THING ABOUT BATMAN. SEE, IT'S ALL EGO. RICH GUY, RIGHT? I KNOW ABOUT EGO. I GOT AN EGO. EVERYBODY'S GOT AN IDOL. MINE HAPPENS TO BE ME. [ LAUGHTER ] I GET UP THREE, FOUR HOURS EARLY TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH MYSELF. YOU KIDDING? I GOT A MIRROR ABOVE MY BED, SO I'M THE FIRST ONE I SEE WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. AND IT ONLY COVERS, LIKE, HALF THE BED, BECAUSE I DON'T NEED TO SEE MY WIFE. I JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT SHE'S GETTING TO LOOK AT ALL DAY LONG. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S ALL EGO. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THAT'S WHAT THE WORLD IS NOW. AND I GET THE CALL. DONNY T. CALLED ME UP. DONNY TRUMP, HE GOES, "DICE" -- BECAUSE WE'RE ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS. HE SAYS, "DICE, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT BEING VICE PRESIDENT FOR A LITTLE WHILE?" I SAID, "NUMBER ONE, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A MORNING GUY. AND YOU FIRED ME OFF OF 'APPRENTICE', BECAUSE I COULDN'T BAKE A CUPCAKE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FIRST EPISODE, DONNY! BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THESE GUYS WANT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT ANYWAY. THEY'RE ALL OLDER THAN US. COME ON, LOOK AT THIS GUY OVER HERE. YOU DON'T GET OUT OF BED LIKE SPIDERMAN ANY MORE AND SHOOT YOUR WEB ON COMMAND. THE MINUTE I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING -- THE MINUTE I WAKE UP AND I OPEN MY EYES, I'M LIKE, "AH, AH, WHAT'S THIS NOW?" AND MY WIFE'S LAYING THERE. SHE'S GOING, "WHAT HAPPENED?" I GO, "WHAT HAPPENED? I'M 58 YEARS OLD. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. I GET OUT OF A CHAIR, MY KNEE BUCKLES, I BANG AGAINST THE WALL. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. I LOOK DOWN MY UNDERWEAR, IT LOOKS LIKE SANTA'S BEARD. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED." [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE'S LIKE, "DID YOU SLEEP GOOD?" HOW GOOD COULD I SLEEP? YOU'RE STILL HERE. GET UP, MAKE ME COFFEE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN -- THEN YOU MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE BATHROOM. WITH THE ACHES, THE PAINS, YOU LOOK AT YOUR BODY IN THE MIRROR LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED. WHY DOES THE BACK OF MY ASS LOOK LIKE A BASSET HOUND'S NECK? [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN YOU SIT ON THE TOILET AND YOUR BALLS ARE MAKING ICED TEA. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WHEN YOU GO TO FLUSH, THEY'RE KNOCKING OFF THE WALLS OF THE TOILET. PAPER GETS WRAPPED AROUND IT. IT SUCKS GETTING OLDER. YOU KNOW WHAT MY WIFE GOT ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY? THE LIFE ALERT BUTTON. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I'M OUT WITH A COUPLE FRIENDS. I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED. MY FRIEND GOES, "WHAT'S THE BUTTON?" I GO, "YOU KNOW, IT STARTS THE CAR." SO HE HITS THE BUTTON, RIGHT? HE HITS THE BUTTON. FIVE MINUTES LATER, HERE COME THE POLICE. HERE COME SECRET SERVICE, FIRE ENGINES, PARAMEDICS. MY FRIEND SAYS TO ME, "WHAT'S GOING ON?" I GO, "WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S GOING ON? I'M PROBABLY GOING TO BE VICE PRESIDENT." OH! [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT CROWD. GOD BLESS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
