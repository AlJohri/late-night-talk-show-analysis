WHILE THE MALE TENNIS PLAYERS SAID, "THANK GOD WE DON'T HAVE TO PLAY HER." [ LAUGHTER ] OH MY GOD. SHE'S FANTASTIC. [ APPLAUSE ] DID YOU SEE THIS? DUE TO THE BRITISH POUND LOSING VALUE IN THE BREXIT, SERENA WILLIAMS'S WIMBELDON PRIZE WENT DOWN FROM BEING WORTH $3 MILLION TO JUST $2.6 MILLION.

I HEARD THAT MMA FIGHTER KHALIL ROUNDTREE -- ANYONE SEE THIS? HE ACTUALLY YELLED AT HIS MOM MID-FIGHT AT THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER 23 ON SATURDAY, SHOUTING QUOTE, "MOM, SHUT UP."

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WOLVES AREN'T EVEN NAMED WOLF. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IF I HAD A WOLF, I'D NAME IT JAKE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN THE NEWS? WHAT ELSE WE GOT? WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON THE NEWS? YOU EVER WONDER WHY THEY FIXED THE DEBT CEILING ON THE SENATE FLOOR? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S MY TIME, EVERYBODY." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT BILL CLINTON WAS SPOTTED HERE IN NEW YORK CITY ON SATURDAY TAKING THE FAMILY DOG FOR A WALK.

THANK YOU.
Jimmy: ON INSTAGRAM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: DID YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE?
I DID. THE OLDER I GET, THE MORE WISDOM AND WATER I RETAIN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE PICTURE I'M GOING TO SHOW, I DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO SET IT UP -- BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE PARTIES, YOU ASK YOUR FRIENDS, DON'T BRING PRESENTS.
JUST DRESS UP. I LOVE COSTUME PARTIES. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS SUCH A A GREAT ICE BREAKER AND EVERYONE HAS FUN, BECAUSE WE ALL LOOK RIDICULOUS. BUT EVERY YEAR MY FRIENDS ALWAYS COMPLAIN ABOUT HAVING TO DRESS UP. SO THIS YEAR I MADE IT REALLY SIMPLE AND I ONLY INVITED CARDBOARD GUESTS.
Jimmy: YEAH. SO, HERE'S YOU, THE QUEEN, HILLARY CLINTON, AND -- [ LAUGHTER ]
THE ROCK, YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ]

YEAH, NO ONE TALKED BACK. IT WAS GREAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT WAS GOOD, YEAH. HOW IS GRANDMA DOING? I ALWAYS ASK YOU ABOUT --
MY GRANDMA'S GREAT.
Jimmy: YOUR GRANDMA ALWAYS GETS YOU INTO TROUBLE.
SHE ALWAYS GETS ME IN TROUBLE AND I ALWAYS COME WITH A GREAT STORY. BUT I PROMISED HER I WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT HER THIS TIME.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD.
BUT SHE -- I THINK SHE HAS A A LITTLE BIT OF A CRUSH ON YOU.
Jimmy: OF SHE DOES? YOUR GRANDMA DOES?
YEAH. I WAS TELLING HER I WAS I WAS ON THE SHOW AND SHE WAS LIKE, "THAT JIMMY FALLON. IF I WAS 50 YEARS YOUNGER, HE WOULD BE MADLY IN LOVE WITH ME." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HEY. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, OH, OH.
Jimmy: HI, GRANDMA. YEAH. SHE MUST BE SO PROUD OF YOU.
SHE IS, YEAH.
Jimmy: IS THIS THE FIFTH?
FIFTH, NUMBER FIVE.
Jimmy: NUMBER FIVE. "LAND OF STORIES" AND THIS THE -- THIS IS THE "AN AUTHOR'S ODYSSEY", THIS ONE, HERE. WHAT IS THIS ONE ABOUT?
WELL, THIS ONE IS ABOUT -- THE BOOK SERIES IS ABOUT A PAIR OF TWINS, AND IN THE BOOK, THEY HAVE TRAVELED TO FAIRY TALE WORLD, THEY'VE TRAVELED INTO WORLDS OF LITERATURE. BUT THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK WHERE THEY TRAVEL INTO THEIR OWN SHORT STORIES AND MEET THE CHARACTERS THAT THEY CREATED.
Jimmy: THEY CREATED. THEY WRITE THEIR OWN THING. I'M SO -- EVERY TIME I SEE YOU BACK STAGE I GO, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU WRITE ALL THESE WORDS.
EVERY WORD. EVERY WORD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, THIS IS THE BOOK THAT I WROTE, RIGHT?
IT'S A GOOD ONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU GOT THAT BOOK. AND THEN THIS IS YOUR BOOK.
YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ACTUAL WORDS IN THIS ONE.
YEAH. DID YOU HAVE A GHOST WRITER FOR THAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF. WELL, THAT'S GOOD. I BROKE A SWEAT MAKING THAT. BUT THIS IS -- YOU DON'T HAVE A A GHOST WRITER?
NO, I WRITE EVERY WORD MYSELF. AND I THINK YOU CAN TELL.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S FANTASTIC. NO, IT'S GOOD. [ CHEERS ]
AW, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S FUNNY, IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THAT. DO YOUR FRIENDS OR FAMILY EVER GO, "HEY, CHRIS, YOU SPELLED SOMETHING WRONG IN THAT E-MAIL" OR WHATEVER?
OH, MY GOD. A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST ASSUME, ESPECIALLY IF THEY MEET ME AFTER THE BOOKS COMES OUT, THEY JUST ASSUME I'M LIKE THIS WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE WHEN IT COMES TO GRAMMAR AND SPELLING. AND I'M THE WORST PERSON TO ASK ADVICE FOR. I'M ALWAYS SPELLING THINGS WRONG. AUTO-CORRECT, IT'S NO ONE'S FRIEND, THAT AUTO-CORRECT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO ONE'S FRIEND? IT'S GOOD. I NEED IT.
MY LITTLE SISTER HAS EPILEPSY, AND I WAS CHECKING IN ON HER WITH MY DAD ONE DAY. AND I TEXTED MY DAD ASKING HOW ARE HER SEIZURES? AND AUTO-CORRECT CHANGED SEIZURES TO SEXINESS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THAT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.
Jimmy: YOUR DAD IS LIKE, "WHAT'S GOING ON?" YEAH. WELL, CONGRATS ON THIS THING AND CONGRATS ON THE "ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS" -- THEY MADE THE MOVIE. I'M THE BIGGEST FAN OF THE SITCOM.
ME TOO, ME TOO.
Jimmy: DID YOU USED TO WATCH IT?
I USED TO -- AS A KID, I USED TO LOVE IT, BECAUSE IT WAS FULL OF PHYSICAL COMEDY, LIKE "I LOVE LUCY." SO AS A KID, I WOULD LAUGH AT THAT. BUT THEN AS I GOT OLDER, I STARTED REALIZING THE PUNS AND THE WITTY HUMOR AND ALL OF THAT.
Jimmy: I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. I USED TO WATCH THEM, ME AND MY SISTER WERE OBSESSED WITH THOSE. SAFFRON, THE DAUGHTER. I LOVED SAFFY.
YES, YES!
Jimmy: SHE'S FANTASTIC. BUT YOU PLAY LIKE A SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER?
I PLAY JENNIFER SAUNDERS'S HAIRDRESSER/SOCIAL MEDIA CONSULTANT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE ALL SHOULD HAVE.
Jimmy: YEAH. CAN WE GIVE AWAY THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE?
YEAH, YEAH! SO, JENNIFER SAUNDERS, WHO IS ONE OF MY HEROES, PLAYS A A PUBLICIST WHO, IN THE PURSUIT OF SIGNING KATE MOSS AS ONE OF HER CLIENTS, KILLS HER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SHE KNOCKS HER OFF A A BRIDGE?
YEAH AND INTO THE RIVER. YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
Jimmy: THE REAL KATE MOSS?
IT'S SO -- AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE I'M IN IT. AND IT'S REALLY FUNNY. AND THIS SCENE IS -- WE'RE READING HER TWEETS AFTER IT HAPPENS.
Jimmy: VERY GOOD. HERE'S CHRIS COLFER READING TWITTER'S REACTION TO HIS BOSS KILLING KATE MOSS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IN "ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS: THE MOVIE."
OH, OH. O-M-G.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
