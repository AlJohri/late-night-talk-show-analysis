Questlove: 197.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. PLEASE, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME, EVERYBODY, TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT! WELCOME. I WANT TO WISH EVERYONE A HAPPY MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY. HAPPY MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MOST PEOPLE CELEBRATE IT BY TAKING THE DAY OFF OF WORK. EXCEPT FOR THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS, WHO DID THAT YESTERDAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DID NOT HAVE A GOOD GAME. THEY DID NOT HAVE A GOOD GAME LAST NIGHT. THEY LOST TO THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS, WHO WILL GO ON TO PLAY IN SUPER BOWL XLIX. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ BOOS ] THERE'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE CONTROVERSY OVER THE GAME. CHECK THIS OUT.
THE LEAGUE IS INVESTIGATING THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS FOR ALLEGEDLY DEFLATING THE BALLS DURING THE GAME. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS INTERESTING. WHAT I THOUGHT WAS IS THAT THEY'RE DEFLATING THE COLTS' BALLS. QUITE THE CONTRARY. POSSIBLY -- THE EDGE WOULD BE TO DEFLATE THE BALLS SO IT'S EASIER TO GRIP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M NOT SURE WHOSE BALLS WERE DEFLATED.
Steve: COLTS BALLS.
Jimmy: IT'S VERY COLD IN BOSTON. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JANUARY. MIDDLE OF JANUARY IN BOSTON, YOUR BALLS ARE PROBABLY GETTING DEFLATED. I'M JUST SAYING. [ LAUGHTER ] FIRST TIME THERE'S BEEN A A SPORTS CONTROVERSY ABOUT DEFLATED BALLS THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE STEROIDS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SAID THE PATRIOTS WERE DEFLATING THE FOOTBALLS. WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT, TOM BRADY SAID -- [ HIGH VOICE ] "I MEAN, THAT IS RIDICULOUS. I MEAN, THE STUFF THESE GUYS COME UP WITH -- SHOW'S OVER. SHOW'S OVER. FORGET IT. I DON'T WANNA DO IT. STOP. I'VE SEEN IT ALL. I'VE SEEN IT ALL." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OKAY. THINGS WERE GETTING PRETTY SCANDALOUS BEFORE THE GAME. LISTEN TO PATRIOTS TIGHT END, ROB GRONKOWSKI, IN AN INTERVIEW BEFORE HE HIT THE FIELD THIS WEEKEND.
WHAT'S ONE THING PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU?
I LIKE TO SNUGGLE.
SO, LIKE SPOONING? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YEAH, WHY NOT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S ROB GRONKOWSKI. GREAT PLAYER, TERRIBLE PLAYA. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, WHY NOT? YOU WANT TO SNUGGLE? WHY NOT? MAYBE, WATCH "THE NOTEBOOK." HANG OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] IN FACT, GRONKOWSKI IS OFTEN KNOWN AS GRONK. HE ISN'T EXACTLY KNOWN FOR HIS ELOQUENCE. HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AFTER YESTERDAY'S WIN. "TEAM PLAY HARD. GRONK PLAY HARD. ONE MORE GAME WE PLAY. WIN GAME, PAPER FALL FROM SKY. LOSE GAME, WATERFALL FROM EYES. BUT TONIGHT, ME CELEBRATE. SHAKE MY BADONKAGRONK." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] BADONKAGRONK. I HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD ABOUT THAT.
Steve: BADONKAGRONK.
Jimmy: AND MEANWHILE, THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS DEFEATED THE GREEN BAY PACKERS TO MOVE ON TO THE SUPER BOWL XLIX. THAT WAS A CRAZY GAME. EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THIS. A FAKE FIELD GOAL PLAY. THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING I WOULD DO ON JOHN MADDEN FOOTBALL ON XBOX. [ LAUGHTER ] FAKE FIELD GOAL PLAY. PUNTER JON RYAN ACTUALLY THREW A TOUCHDOWN PASS FOR THE SEAHAWKS' FIRST POINTS IN THE GAME. HE DOESN'T REALLY -- THAT'S NOT HIS JOB, TO THROW A FOOTBALL. BUT ANYWAY, HE DID IT. AND HE SEEMED PRETTY CONFIDENT. LOOK AT THE PHOTO OF HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN WE SEE IT AGAIN? AH!
Steve: MY BALLS ARE DEFLATED! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GET THIS THING AWAY FROM ME! LOOKS LIKE A WILL FERRELL CHARACTER. THE OTHER BIG STORY IS TOMORROW'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. I READ THAT DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH, ONE CABINET MEMBER WILL BE ASKED TO STAY BEHIND TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT, IN CASE THERE'S A CRISIS AT THE CAPITOL. AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TELLING BIDEN. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GET TO STAY IN YOUR ROOM AND BE THE BOSS OF EVERYTHING. JUST STAY HOME, YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME. OKAY? COOL. YOU GET ICE CREAM. ALL THE ICE CREAM YOU WANT. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. MORE POLITICAL NEWS. THE RNC RELEASED ITS FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SCHEDULE, WHICH INCLUDES AT LEAST NINE DEBATES IN DIFFERENT STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AS OPPOSED TO THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATES, WHICH WILL JUST BE HILLARY STARING AT HER OPPONENTS UNTIL THEY BURST INTO FLAMES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LISTEN TO THIS, GUYS. IT'S RUMORED THAT "HOMELAND" STAR MANDY PATINKIN WILL PROVIDE THE VOICE OF PAPA SMURF IN NEXT YEAR'S ANIMATED "SMURFS" MOVIE.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, HE'S COOL. BUT THEY'VE ALREADY RELEASED FOOTAGE AND IT SEEMS LIKE PATINKIN'S HAVING TROUBLE SHAKING OFF HIS "HOMELAND" CHARACTER. I DON'T KNOW, TAKE A LOOK. SEE WHAT YOU THINK.
HE CANNOT BE WITH HIM.
WHO ARE YOU TO SAY THAT TO ME?
YOU'RE THROWING YOUR LIFE AWAY.
MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE MY WHOLE LIFE.
LIKE ME.
LIKE YOU.
YOU'RE THE SMARTEST AND THE DUMBEST [ BLEEP ] PERSON I'VE EVER KNOWN. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY. WHAT THE SMURF?
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, A LITTLE LOCAL NEWS HERE. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT NEW YORK'S JFK AIRPORT HAS PLANS TO OPEN THE WORLD'S FIRST AIRPORT TERMINAL FOR ANIMALS NEXT YEAR. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, LAGUARDIA HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO FINALLY OPEN A TERMINAL FOR HUMANS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR CUSTODY OF THEIR GRANDDAUGHTER.
OF THEIR GRANDDAUGHTER, RIGHT. RIGHT, RIGHT. THIS BEAUTIFUL LITTLE MIXED RACE GRANDDAUGHTER. AND IT'S BETWEEN KEVIN COSTNER AND OCTAVIA SPENCER, WHO ARE THE GRANDPARENTS. KEVIN COSTNER'S DAUGHTER DIED IN CHILDBIRTH, AND OCTAVIA SPENCER'S SON IS A DRUG ADDICT AND NOT ABLE TO BE A A FATHER. SO, THE IDEA IS, WOULD THE CHILD BE BETTER SERVED IN BRENTWOOD WITH HER GRANDFATHER OR IN SOUTH CENTRAL WITH HER GRANDMOTHER? AND THAT'S WHERE THE CONFLICT COMES IN.
Jimmy: HERE WE GO. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S ANTHONY MACKIE IN "BLACK OR WHITE." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
NOW LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO WIN CUSTODY FROM ELLIOTT, IT WON'T HELP BRINGING HIM INTO THIS. NOW, I SAY WE GO WITH MY ORIGINAL BRIEF. YOU PETITION FOR CUSTODY.
HE IS THE FATHER.
HE DOESN'T WANT THE JOB! WILL YOU PLEASE TELL HER, ANDREA?
AUNTIE, YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO HIM.
