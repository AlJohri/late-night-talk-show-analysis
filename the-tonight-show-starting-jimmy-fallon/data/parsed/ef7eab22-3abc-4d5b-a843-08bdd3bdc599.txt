MAN, RUSSIA IS MAKING A LOT OF PEOPLE NERVOUS RIGHT NOW. IN FACT, SOME ARE EVEN SAYING THAT THE COUNTRY MAY BE STARTING A SECOND COLD WAR AFTER IT SENT SHIPS TO CUBA YESTERDAY. AND VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS LIKE, "WHAT IS BIG DEAL? I'M JUST DOING THROW BACK THURSDAY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] #TBT. "DO YOU BELIEVE MY HAIR LOOKED LIKE THAT? EVERYBODY WAS WEARING THOSE PANTS." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS OUT OF RUSSIA, THIS WEEK, THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT GAVE ALL 44 OF ITS OLYMPIC MEDALISTS A A NEW MERCEDES. WHEN ASKED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ATHLETES WHO IS DIDN'T MEDAL, PUTIN SAID, "DO NOT OPEN TRUNK." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "TRUST ME. DO YOU BELIEVE I WORE THAT JACKET? IT'S IS CRAZY.

[ LAUGHTER ] VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN REACHED OUT ON BEHALF OF THE WHITE HOUSE TO PLEDGE OUR FULL SUPPORT. OF COURSE WHEN HE HEARD HE WAS CALLING ARSENIY, BIDEN WAS LIKE, "SWEET, I LOVE THAT GUY. WHOO! WHOO! WHOO!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M IN THE DOG POUND. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M IN THE DOG POUND, DOG. ARSENIY! WOO! WOO! WOO! [ LAUGHTER ] THIS SUNDAY IS THE ACADEMY AWARDS, YOU GUYS.

Jimmy: SPEAKING OF MOVIES, THE NEW FILM "SON OF GOD" CAME OUT TODAY, AND IT FOLLOWS THE LIFE OF JESUS. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SEE IT. IN FACT, I STAYED OFF THE INTERNET ALL WEEK TO AVOID SPOILERS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DON'T TELL ME. DON'T TELL ME, THE BOAT SCENE, DON'T TELL ME. AND GET THIS, SOME CRITICS ARE SAYING THE ACTOR WHO PLAYS JESUS IN THE MOVIE IS TOO GOOD LOOKING. WHILE THE REAL JESUS SAID, "WHAT THE HECK'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?" [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK IT'S PERFECT CASTING. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? THIS IS KIND OF COOL. BOEING, THE AIRPLANE MANUFACTURER IS WORKING ON A A NEW SMART PHONE THAT WILL SELF-DESTRUCT IF IT'S TAMPERED WITH.

[ LAUGHTER ] HE'S WAS LIKE, "I DON'T REMEMBER BILLY BEING ASIAN OR A A GIRL. BILLY?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: GET IN THE CAR.
Jimmy: ON LAST NIGHT'S EPISODE OF "HONEY BOO BOO," MAMA JUNE WAS WITH HER DAUGHTER PUMPKIN TALKING ABOUT HOW ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS CAN CHANGE OVER TIME. I'M NOT SURE PUMPKIN REALLY WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT IT. TAKE A LOOK.
WHEN WE FIRST MET, ALL WE WANTED TO DO IS WHAM, BAM, THANK YOU MA'AM AND ALL THAT. BUT, NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER NINE YEARS IT'S KIND OF LIKE I'VE GOTTEN COMFORTABLE.
WHAM, BAM, THANK YOU WHAT?
MA'AM.
WHAT?
GET IN THE BED, FOUR, FIVE TIMES A NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SAID THESE WORDS OUT LOUD, BUT I AGREE WITH PUMPKIN. I LOVE THAT THE SHOW'S IN ENGLISH, YET IT HAS SUBTITLES. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S THE BEST SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. THIS IS ANOTHER CRAZY STORY, A A FUNERAL HOME IN MISSISSIPPI SAYS THAT A MAN CAME BACK TO LIFE THIS WEEK HOURS AFTER HE WAS BROUGHT IN AND DECLARED DEAD. THEY KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP WHEN HIS FRIEND GAVE A MOVING EULOGY AND THE MAN SAID, "THANKS DAVE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY AFTER ADMITTING LAST SUMMER THAT SHE USED RACIAL SLURS, IT LOOKS LIKE PAULA DEEN IS TRYING TO MAKE A A COMEBACK, AND SHE SHOWED UP AT THE FOOD FESTIVAL IN MIAMI THIS WEEK.

HE SAID --BECAUSE I SAID IN THE PAPER SOMETHING LIKE I WAS AFRAID OF HIM. THEY SAID, LIKE, WOULD YOU EVER HAVE THE CHICAGO MAYOR ON? I SAID, SURE, I KNOW RAHM EMMANUEL, BUT I'M AFRAID OF HIM, HE CAN HOST IF HE WANTS TO. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER. HE SAID, "I WON'T COME ON YOUR SHOW BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TOUGH ENOUGH." HE GOES, "TO PROVE TO ME THAT YOU'RE A REAL MAN, COME TO THE POLAR PLUNGE." I SAID, "DONE, I'LL SEE YOU AT THE POLAR PLUNGE." I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE THE PURPLE PIT LIKE ON 90210. GET A MILKSHAKE OR SOMETHING. IT'S NOT, IT'S WHERE YOU JUMP INTO LAKE MICHIGAN AND IT'S FROZEN SOLID. THEY HAD TO GET A BULLDOZER IN TOMORROW AND THEY'RE GOING TO BULLDOZE THE TOP OF THE ICE.
Steve: THAT'S INSANE.
Jimmy: BUT, IT'S FOR SPECIAL OLYMPICS. SO, I'M DOING IT, AND IT'S A A GOOD THING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] RAHM, I'M A MAN OF MY WORD, I'LL SEE YOU THERE, MR. MAYOR. AND TO EVERYBODY HERE, I'VE HAD A GREAT TIME HOSTING "THE TONIGHT SHOW," IT'S BEEN FUN. IT'S THE LAST EPISODE, WE HAD A A GOOD RUN.

NO, NO, NO.
Jimmy: SEVEN DAYS.
IT'S NOT -- THIS IS NOT LIKE A QUICK FIX. THIS IS NOT A TEN-DAY -- IT'S NOT A REGIMENT, IT'S NOT A DIET AT ALL. IT'S ABOUT YOUR NUTRITION AND HOW YOUR BODY ACTUALLY WORKS ON A CELLULAR LEVEL. SO, IT'S ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FOREVER FROM ALL THESE DIET FADS, BUT YOU UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE THINGS ACTUALLY ARE GOOD FOR YOUR BODY. BECAUSE YOUR BODY IS VERY COMPLEX. AND IT REQUIRES A LOT OF NUTRITION. DIETS ARE USUALLY ABOUT DEPRIVATION. AND NUTRITION IS ABOUT ABUNDANCE. TO HAVE GOOD NUTRITION YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO EAT A LOT OF FOOD. DOESN'T IT SOUND SO MUCH MORE FUN TO HAVE GOOD NUTRITION INSTEAD OF BEING ON A DIET?
Jimmy: YES. I MEAN PLEASE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I LOVED IT. THERE WAS A THING IN HERE THAT I LOVED WAS CALLED SHALLOT GOLD YOU CALLED IT.
SHALLOT GOLD.
Jimmy: IT SOUNDS LIKE A A DANCE JOKE FROM THE 70S.

Jimmy: HOW DO YOU MAKE IT?
YOU TAKE AS MANY SHALLOTS AS YOU WANT, I DO A HUGE BATCH AT ONCE BECAUSE I LIKE TO HAVE IT AROUND IN A BIG CONTAINER IN THE REFRIGERATOR, AND I JUST MINCE IT DOWN INTO SMALL PIECES, THEN I PUT IT ON HIGH HEAT WITH OIL IN THE PAN FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES -- BURN THE WATER OUT OF IT, THEN TURN IT DOWN TO LOW TO SIMMER FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR. AND IT GETS ALL CARAMELIZED AND GOLD LIKE AND IT TASTES LIKE BACON, BASICALLY. IT'S JUST TASTES LIKE -- YOU PUT A LITTLE SALT ON IT TO PULL UP THE SWEET AND HAVE A LITTLE SAVORY WITH IT.
Jimmy: INSTEAD OF BACON BITS, YOU USE ONION.
I USE ONION, AND I JUST KEEP IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND THEN ANY TIME I'M EATING SOMETHING, I'M LIKE, WHAT DOES THIS NEED? A DOLLOP OF SHALLOT GOLD AND IT CHANGES EVERYTHING.
