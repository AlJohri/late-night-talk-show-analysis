YEAH, I WAS IN LOUISIANA SHOOTING A MOVIE AND JORDAN CALLED ME HE WAS LIKE, "YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT JUST HAPPENED RIGHT NOW. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND AS HE'S CALLING ME, I'M LIKE, -- I'M TALKING TO JORDAN AND LOOK AT THE PHONE. AND IT'S A TWEET FROM YOU OR FROM THE SHOW, FROM "LATE NIGHT" SAYING, "KIND OF MIGHT WANT TO WATCH THE SHOW TONIGHT."
Jimmy: YOU GET A SHOUT-OUT FROM THE MOST IMPORTANT MAN --
ON PLANET EARTH.
Jimmy: ON THE PLANET EARTH.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THEN I JUST LOVE -- I LOVE LUTHER. IT'S GREAT. HE LOVES IT. AND THEN HERE'S WHAT I JUST LOVE. YOU MENTION SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON THE SHOW AND IT'S FUN AND WE'RE ALL LAUGHING. THEN I GET TO WATCH THE "WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER" THIS PAST YEAR AND WHO'S STANDING NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DOING A COMEDY BIT BUT YOU, SIR.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
Jimmy: YOU WERE FANTASTIC. YOU WERE REALLY GREAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS A SOLID PIECE OF COMEDY.
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. IT WAS THE SECOND GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE BECAUSE I LOVE MY WIFE. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. WHAT'S IT LIKE REHEARSING WITH THE PRESIDENT?
I WAS IN A ROOM IN THE WEST WING CALLED "THE MAP ROOM," WHICH IS WHERE FDR USED TO STORE ALL OF HIS MAPS OR WHATEVER. VERY HISTORICAL ROOM. AND THE PRESIDENT, ALL OF A A SUDDEN YOU FEEL THIS -- A A WARM WIND, LIKE THE HOLY SPIRIT, BLOWS INTO THE ROOM. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE JUST -- HE JUST KIND OF -- HE JUST UP AND WALKED LIKE -- LIKE STAND UP, JIMMY. HE JUST WALKS INTO THE ROOM LIKE THIS. HE'S LIKE "THERE IS KEEGAN. WHAT'S GOING ON?" AND JUST GOT IN THERE. HE JUST GRABS ME AND HUGS ME. AND I'M LIKE, "THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ALWAYS AFRAID THERE'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE RED DOT ON YOUR HEAD." YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Jimmy: OH YEAH, NO --
"NO, HE HUGGED ME. HE HUGGED ME. HE HUGGED ME. BUT HE HUGGED ME!" [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT ASSAULTING THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD.
Jimmy: NO.
HE HUGGED ME. AND SO AND THEN WE RAN THROUGH IT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND THE PRESIDENT WAS LIKE, "OH, YOU GOT TO GET IT IN IN THERE. YOU GOT TO KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU. THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF. CAN'T BE LAUGHING IN THERE, OKAY?" WE GET TWO LINES INTO THE REHEARSAL, HE'S LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] "I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'VE GOT TO KEEP IT TOGETHER." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, "YEAH, YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP IT TOGETHER. DON'T YOU [ BLEEP ] ME OUT THERE, BARACK!" [ LAUGHTER ] "DON'T YOU [ BLEEP ] ME!"
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.
RED DOT, RED DOT!
Jimmy: NO, RED DOT. RED DOT.
"THIS IS THE BIGGEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE, YOU SON OF A --"
Jimmy: YOU DID NOT.
I DID NOT SAY THAT. I DID NOT SAY THAT.
Jimmy: AND IT REALLY WORKED OUT FOR THE BEST.
IT WENT REALLY WELL.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP HERE. IT'S A NEW CHARACTER. THIS IS CALLED "JUDGE JESSIE." THIS IS FROM YOUR SHOW "KEY & PEELE." HERE'S KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY. WATCH THIS.
TODAY ON "JUDGE JESSIE," JUDGE JESSIE TURNS UP THE HEAT.
YOU SIGNED A PIECE OF PAPER. HE GAVE YOU THE SNAKE. THEN YOU BRING A SNAKE INTO THE HOME WITH TWO SMALL CHIHUAHUAS!
I HAD NOT BEEN MADE AWARE THAT THE SNAKE WOULD GET RID OF THE SKIN AND THE SPRINKLERS CAME DOWN WITH THE SNAKE RUINING MY CARPET.
WHAT SET OFF THE SPRINKLERS?
UNRELATED POPCORN FIRE, YOUR HONOR.
"JUDGE JESSIE" AS A POLICE OFFICER, HE DEFENDED THE STREETS. AS A TRIAL LAWYER --
OBJECTION!
HE FOUGHT FOR THE TRUTH. AS A BLACK BELT. [ YELLING ] HE MASTERED DISCIPLINE. AS A CARPENTER, HE LEARNED THE VALUE OF CRAFTSMANSHIP. AS A SURGEON, HE MASTERED A A COOL HEAD. AS A CRACK HO, HE LEARNED TO GO DAYS WITHOUT SLEEP. AND AS AN ANNOUNCER, HE DOES THE VOICEOVER ON THIS SHOW. COMING UP ON "JUDGE JESSIE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH, KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY, SO HAPPY FOR YOU, BUDDY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WATCH "KEY & PEELE" WEDNESDAY AT 10:00 P.M. "COMEDY CENTRAL." WE HAVE STAND-UP FROM MONROE MARTIN AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WE'RE JOINED RIGHT NOW BY A VERY FUNNY COMEDIAN. HE IS PART OF THE CAST OF THE UPCOMING NETFLIX SERIES "MASTERS OF NONE." AND YOU CAN ALSO CATCH HIS ACT LIVE HERE IN NEW YORK CITY AT THE STAND COMEDY CLUB. SAY HELLO TO MONROE MARTIN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. I JUST CAME BACK FROM ITALY, WENT THERE THIS SUMMER. I DON'T -- I DIDN'T' BELIEVE -- THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT WAS REAL. I THOUGHT IT WAS A POSTCARD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT THAT'S HOW IGNORANT I AM. LIKE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GEOGRAPHY. IF YOU SHOWED ME A MAP AND AMERICA WASN'T ON IT, I WOULD BE LIKE, "OH, YOU LIKE 'GAME OF THRONES,' TOO?" [ LAUGHTER ] I LEARN BY GOING TO ITALY THAT THEY BANNED GMOs FROM THEIR COUNTRY, WHICH IS AMAZING. IT SHOWS THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR PEOPLE. OVER HERE, WE'RE JUST GIVING PEOPLE NINJA TURTLE MEAT BY THE POUND. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THAT, LIKE I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT WILL STAND ON A SOAPBOX FOR THE ANIMALS. LIKE, I KNOW THEY PUT STEROIDS IN IT. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S FREE RANGE, LIKE, I DON'T CARE IF MY CHICKEN WENT TO COLLEGE FOR LIKED POETRY. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, I WATCHED THEM PUT STEROIDS IN THE CHICKEN. I'M LIKE, YEAH, YOU DO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT MY CHICKEN DOING PUSH-UPS WHEN THEY COME TO KILL IT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE STRONGEST CHICKEN IN THE CAGE. I WANT TO HAVE CHICKEN WITH "CAGE LIFE" WRITTEN ACROSS IT'S STOMACH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE GOT TEAR DROP TATTOOS ON THE SIDE OF HIS FACE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE KILLED FOUR OTHER CHICKENS JUST TO BECOME NUGGETS FIRST. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I WANT THAT CHICKEN THAT WAS PLAYING "GET FRIED OR DIE TRYING" IN THE BACKGROUND. [ LAUGHTER ] WALKED TO THE FRONT OF THE CAGE LIKE, "I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU SONS OF BITCHES. [ LAUGHTER ] JUMPS IN THE GREASE AND PLUCKS HIS OWN FEATHERS. [ LAUGHTER ] I BELIEVE YOU CAN ONLY EAT AS HEALTHY AS THE STORES SURROUNDING YOUR AREA. I LIVE IN BEDSIDE BROOKLYN SO I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] NO MATTER WHAT STORE I GO TO, THERE'S ALWAYS A FLOOR REFRIGERATOR DEDICATED TO ARIZONA ICED TEA. [ LAUGHTER ] ARIZONA ICED TEA WAS DESIGNED TO KILL THE LOWER CLASS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] 32 OUNCES OF STRAIGHT DIABETES -- [ LAUGHTER ]  -- FOR ONLY 99 CENTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DRANK ONE, I PEED OUT CAKE. THAT'S HOW SWEET IT IS. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, OOH, RED VELVET! [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE NEVER EVEN SEE ANIMALS EAT HEALTHY AROUND MY WAY. LIKE, I'VE NEVER SEEN A RODENT, LIKE A SQUIRREL, EAT AN ACORN OR A NUT. I'VE SEEN A SQUIRREL EAT A A PEANUT M&M, AND I WAS VERY CONCERNED. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE HE ATE ALL THE CHOCOLATE AND LEFT THE NUT. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS LIKE, "YO, YOU GOT TO SLOW DOWN ON THE SUGAR. YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR TAIL, MAN." [ LAUGHTER ] TERRIBLE, MAN. I WATCH THE NEWS A LOT. I WATCH CNN BECAUSE THAT'S NEWS FOR PEOPLE WITH A.D.D. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S SO MUCH STUFF ON THAT SCREEN AT ONE TIME THAT YOU GOT TO FOCUS ON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY GOT LETTERS, NUMBERS, STUFF SCROLLING OVER THE BOTTOM, PEOPLE TALKING OVER HERE. YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH THE NEWS LIKE A CAT FOLLOWING A LASER BEAM. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I WATCH CNN BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHENEVER I WATCH IT. I PAY ATTENTION TO THE STUFF SCROLLING AT THE BOTTOM BECAUSE THAT'S THE REAL NEWS. AND THEY KNOW PEOPLE DON'T READ ANYMORE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DISTRACT US ALL WITH THE BULL CRAP. THEY BE LIKE, "JUSTIN BIEBER CAUGHT DRAG RACING IN FLORIDA. WE'RE BRINGING BACK SLAVERY NEXT TUESDAY." [ LAUGHTER ] THEY TALK ABOUT RACISM A LOT IN THE NEWS. I THINK I'M A LITTLE DESENSITIZED NOW BECAUSE EVERYTHING I ENJOYED AS A KID ALWAYS HAD A HINT OF RACISM IN IT. MY FAVORITE COMIC BOOK CHARACTER WAS THE INCREDIBLE HULK. JUST REALIZED HE WAS A BLACK DUDE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHEN HE'S BRUCE BANNER, LITTLE FRAIL WHITE GUY, NO ONE IS AFRAID OF HIM, HE'S SUPER SMART. WHEN HE GETS UPSET, HE TURNS INTO A BIG BLACK DUDE, BUT THEY DON'T MAKE HIS SKIN BLACK BECAUSE THAT'S WAY TOO OBVIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THEY MAKE HIM DARK GREEN AND PUT SLAVE PANTS ON HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S HUNCHED OVER 'CAUSE SOCIETY IS KEEPING HIM DOWN. DON'T SPEAK PROPER ENGLISH ANYMORE. HE'S LIKE -- [ MUMBLING ] [ LAUGHTER ] SMASH. HE CAN'T FLY, BUT HE CAN JUMP REAL HIGH. [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW A BLACK DUDE WHEN I SEE ONE, MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, THANK Y'ALL. Y'ALL HAVE BEEN AWESOME. APPRECIATE THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WOW! THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT THERE, MAN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT! MONROE MARTIN, EVERYBODY! THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT. MORE "TONIGHT SHOW" AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. WOW! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: MONROE MARTIN! WRITE THAT NAME DOWN. OH, MY GOD. MY THANKS TO KEVIN SPACEY, KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY, MONROE MARTIN, THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. STAY TUNED FOR "LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS." THANKS FOR WATCHING. HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND. HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. BYE-BYE EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
