THAT FEELS GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE. HI, AMERICA, HOW ARE YOU? LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE. [ CHEERS ] WELL, NOT EVERYBODY JUST WOOED IS ACTUALLY IN LOVE. SOME PEOPLE, YOU THINK YOU'RE IN LOVE, BUT YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE. WE'RE GOING TO HELP TO YOU GET THE HELL OUT OF THAT RIGHT NOW. LOVE, HERE'S THE THING ABOUT LOVE -- LOVE, A COUPLE OF TESTS YOU CAN DO AT HOME, THINGS THAT YOU DO TO SEE AM I REALLY IN A LOVING RELATIONSHIP? HERE'S ONE. SIMPLE ONE, YOU CAN DO THIS TONIGHT. SIT ON YOUR COUCH BY YOURSELF. WATCH TELEVISION. IF THE PERSON THAT YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH WALKS INTO THE ROOM AND IN FRONT OF THE TV AND YOU WATCH THEM WALK THROUGH LIKE THIS -- [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT LOVE. NO, LOVE IS WHEN YOU SEE EACH OTHER, AND YOU START TALKING TO EACH OTHER LIKE YOUR PETS. THAT'S LOVE RIGHT THERE. "ARE YOU COMING TO HANG OUT WITH ME? ARE YOU COMING TO -- RIGHT NOW? YOU COME HERE. YOU COME HERE." [ LAUGHTER ] LOVE IS VERY SING-SONGY. THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU'LL REALIZE ABOUT LOVE. IT'S VERY -- THERE'S A A MUSICALITY TO IT. LET'S SAY THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE WITH IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND THEY CALL OUT YOUR NAME AND IT'S, YOU KNOW, SING-SONGY. YOU ANSWER BACK, THEY CALL YOUR NAME. "HEY, BABY, YOU CALLED? HEY! JUST GIVE ME A SECOND. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!" [ LAUGHTER ] "I JUST NEED A MINUTE! I'M COMING!" IT'S NOT LOVE IF THEY CALL YOUR NAME AND YOU ARE LIKE, "WHAT!" [ LAUGHTER ] "WHAT? COME HERE. YOU HAVE LEGS! CALL MY PHONE! I CAN'T STAND YOU RIGHT NOW!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S NOT LOVE. I WATCHED A COUPLE THE OTHER NIGHT. THIS TO ME WAS KIND OF LIKE THE, I DON'T KNOW, THE ANTITHESIS OF REAL, TRUE LOVE. THERE WAS A COUPLE. THEY WERE MARRIED FOR TEN YEARS. AND THEY WERE SITTING -- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. I HAD LIKE A VISCERAL REACTION WATCHING THIS PROFILE ON TV, AND THEY WERE LOOKING THROUGH OLD PHOTOS TOGETHER. AND THE WIFE SAYS TO HER HUSBAND, "THIS IS ME WHEN I WAS 5-YEARS-OLD. MY PARENTS TOOK ME TO DISNEY WORLD." AND HE WAS LIKE, "OH, THAT'S SO COOL! LET ME SEE THAT PICTURE OF YOU. LIKE, THIS IS CRAZY BECAUSE I WENT TO DISNEY WORLD WHEN I WAS 5, AND THAT LOOKS LIKE MY DAD IN YOUR PICTURE. DO YOU HAVE OTHER PICTURES?" SO, YEAH. THEY LOOKED THROUGH A FEW MORE PICTURES, AND SURE ENOUGH, THERE'S A PICTURE OF THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER STANDING SIDE-BY-SIDE AT 5-YEARS-OLD. AND THEY'RE ALMOST SHOULDER TO SHOULDER. SHE'S ALMOST KIND OF LOOKING AT HIM. THEY'RE BOTH LIKE -- AND I REALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST KIND OF AN UNBELIEVABLE, SERENDIPITOUS, UNIVERSAL LOVE MOMENT. I THOUGHT THE ONLY THING THAT COULD REALLY MAKE THIS FAR MORE INCREDIBLE OR ENCHANTING IS IF THAT COUPLE WAS MURDERED -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- AND THE GUY THAT KILLED THEM WAS ALSO IN THE PICTURE WHEN HE WAS 5-YEARS- OLD. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S JUST ON A RIDE IN THE BACKGROUND STARING DOWN. AND I SUPPOSE THE ONLY THING THAT COULD TRUMP THAT IS IF THE HOMICIDE DETECTIVE THAT FOUND THE MURDER THAT KILLED THE COUPLE, ALSO IN THE PICTURE WHEN HE WAS 5. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK IT'S AMAZING THE WAY WOMEN, YOU REMEMBER THE EXACT MOMENT THAT YOU REALIZED YOU'RE IN LOVE AND USUALLY WAIT. YOU HOLD BACK FOR A LITTLE BIT, AND THEN FINALLY ONE NIGHT YOU'RE LAYING IN BED. WE'RE PLAYING FOOTSIES, AND YOU LIKE TO GET A LITTLE BIT SHY. "DO YOU KNOW WHEN I KNEW, DO YOU KNOW WHEN I REALLY KNEW THAT I REALLY WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU? DO YOU KNOW WHEN I KNEW? AND I'M SO EMBARRASSED TO TELL YOU THIS." GIRLS LOVE BEING EMBARRASSED, DON'T YOU? "I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OKAY. HERE IT IS. THIS IS WHEN I KNEW THAT I LOVED YOU. FOUR MONTHS BEFORE WE MET -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- I WENT TO A PSYCHIC. SHE TOLD ME I WAS GOING TO MEET A GUY THAT WEARS HATS. I WAS, LIKE, I DON'T LIKE HATS ON GUYS, SO THIS IS ALL WRONG ALREADY. TWO WEEKS LATER, I SAW YOU AT THE FARMER'S MARKET THREE AND A A HALF MONTHS BEFORE WE MET. YOU WERE BUYING KETTLE CORN. YOU WERE WEARING A HAT. [ GIGGLES ] AND TWO THINGS OCCURRED TO ME IN THAT MOMENT. NUMBER ONE, I KNEW THAT I WAS DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH YOU. AND NUMBER TWO, I COULD FEEL THE SHADOW OF YOUR CHILD GROWING INSIDE OF ME. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T FREAK OUT. JUST A SHADOW CHILD, NOT A REAL BABY. JUST A SHADOW CHILD. YOU ARE SAYING, DANE COOK, HOW CAN I KEEP THE RELATIONSHIP EFFERVESCENT AND EXCITING AND BRING IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL? YOU GOT TO WATCH PORN TOGETHER AS A COUPLE, YES. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. YES, OF COURSE, WATCH SOME PORN TOGETHER. MAKE IT AN EXPERIENCE, RIGHT? YOU SIT DOWN. YOU KNOW, GET THE iPAD OUT, RIGHT? FIRST THING YOU DO IS GO TO THE CATEGORIES. OKAY? GO TO THE CATEGORIES. OPEN THOSE UP. PERUSE. TAKE A LOOK AROUND. DON'T BE INTIMATED BECAUSE THE CATEGORIES IS, IT'S PRETTY EXTENSIVE. THEY'VE ADDED A LOT. [ LAUGHTER ] CATEGORY SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO, IT WAS LIKE ASIAN, THREESOME, LATINA. THAT'S ABOUT ALL YOU HAD. YOU OPEN UP THE CATEGORIES NOW IT'S LIKE THE MENU AT CHEESECAKE FACTORY. IT'S JUST AN ANXIETY-RIDDLED -- [ LAUGHTER ] SO, WHAT IS A CATEGORY THAT YOU CAN ENJOY TOGETHER? THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. I WOULD RECOMMEND STARTING WITH SOMETHING LIKE ROLE PLAYING. YOU GUYS CAN DO SOME ROLE PLAYING, RIGHT? THAT'S GOT TO BE A GREAT THING TO DO TOGETHER. IF YOU'RE SAYING, "DANE, I'M A A LITTLE TREPEDACIOUS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ROLE PLAYING. HOW DO I DO IT?" I'M GOING TO PREPARE YOU RIGHT NOW. IT'S REAL SIMPLE. TRADITIONALLY, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. THE WOMAN WILL DRESS UP AS, LIKE, A PRINCESS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THE GUY WILL DRESS AS A GUY THAT WANTS TO BANG A A PRINCESS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, YOU'RE BASICALLY WEARING THE OUTFIT RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE IN PRINCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. I'M -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M DANE COOK. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
