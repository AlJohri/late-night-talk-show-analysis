Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY, VERY, VERY MUCH. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOT CROWD! HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, EVERYBODY. OF COURSE TONIGHT WAS GAME FOUR OF THE NBA FINALS. THIS IS COOL. YEAH. ONE PERSON EXCITED ABOUT THIS. VERY GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] DID YOU SEE THIS, THOUGH? THERE IS A VIDEO ONLINE, THAT'S VERY COOL, YESTERDAY SHOWED LeBRON JAMES WHEN HE WAS JUST 16 TALKING ABOUT HIS DREAM OF PLAYING IN THE NBA. YEAH. WHICH IS INTERESTING, 'CAUSE MOST OF HIS TEAMMATES STILL HAVE THAT SAME DREAM. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE LIKE, PASS ME THE BALL. I'M WIDE OPEN. COME ON. GIVE ME A CHANCE. [ APPLAUSE ] LET'S GET TO SOME POLITICAL NEWS HERE. I SAW THAT HILLARY CLINTON JOINED INSTAGRAM YESTERDAY. [ CHEERS ] YEAH. AND HER FIRST PHOTO, THIS IS TRUE, WAS OF RED WHITE AND BLUE PANTS SUITS. [ LAUGHTER ] WITH THE CAPTION "HARD CHOICES." YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] EVERYBODY AGREED IT WAS A GREAT JOKE AND HILLARY WAS LIKE, "WHAT JOKE? I'M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH ONE SHOULD I WEAR? IT'S NOT A JOKE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT OLYMPIC FIGURE SKATER MICHELLE KWAN IS NOW A A FULL-TIME PAID STAFFER ON HILLARY CLINTON'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. YEAH. WHILE TONYA HARDING WAS HIRED TO TAKE CARE OF ANY OTHER DEMOCRATS WHO ENTERED THE RACE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LISTEN TO THIS. REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE CARLY FIORINA SAID THAT IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT SHE WANTS PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OUT THEIR PHONES AND VOTE ON IDEAS DURING HER SPEECHES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH WORKED OUT WELL FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE THEIR PHONES OUT DURING CARLY FIORINA'S SPEECHES. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S THAT?
Steve: I'M VOTING.
Jimmy: CARLY FIORINA ALSO SAID THAT SHE DOESN'T PERSONALLY SUPPORT LEGAL MARIJUANA, BUT SHE RESPECTS STATES HAVING THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON IT. WHICH BACKFIRED WHEN STONERS WERE LIKE, "HEY, HILLARY'S PRETTY COOL AFTER ALL." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT HILL -- THIS IS JUST CRAZY. ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY LORD VOLDEMORT, FROM "HARRY POTTER," ACTUALLY HAS A A HIGHER FAVORABILITY RATING THAN MOST GOP CANDIDATES. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: IN OTHER WORDS, HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED IS MORE POPULAR THAN HE WHOSE NAME I FORGOT AND WHAT'S HER FACE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS IS PRETTY BIG. I SAW THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN TRAVELED TO ITALY TO MEET WITH POPE FRANCIS YESTERDAY. THEY SAID HE SHOULD BE DONE WITH CONFESSION BY SOMETIME NEXT FALL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ RUSSIAN ACCENT ] "OKAY, THAT TAKES CARE OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE I POISONED, NOW LET'S GET TO PEOPLE I CHOKED. THIS COULD TAKE A WHILE." [ LAUGHTER ] IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY, VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS ASKED IF HE HAD ANY REGRETS AND HE SAID QUOTE "GOD HAS BUILT MY LIFE IN A WAY THAT I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO REGRET." THEN HE ADMITTED -- [ RUSSIAN ACCENT ] "I STEAL THAT FROM KANYE." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHERE HE GETS IT.
Steve: HE LOVES THE WEST.
Jimmy: YEAH HE DOES. SOME TV NEWS. IT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT RAVEN SYMONE IS NOW A PERMANENT CO-HOST ON "THE VIEW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND I -- I HAVE A FEELING THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SEEN THIS COMING. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH. THERE YOU GO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT IS SO HER. THAT IS SO HER. THAT IS SO -- [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS SO HER. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS, THIS IS TRUE. PEPSI RECENTLY HINTED IT WOULD BE BRINGING BACK THE FAMOUS '90s SODA CRYSTAL PEPSI. [ CHEERS ] WHEN ASKED WHEN THEY'D START MAKING CRYSTAL PEPSI, EXECUTIVES WERE LIKE, "OH, YEAH, WE'RE TOTALLY MAKING NEW CRYSTAL PEPSI, NOT JUST BLOWING DUST OFF OLD UNSOLD CASES FROM 1992." [ LAUGHTER ] ALL THE CANS HAVE A PICTURE OF URKEL ON THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS IS A LITTLE WEIRD. YESTERDAY SOME REPORTERS WERE READING OUT TWEETS WITH THE HASHTAG "IN THE '90s I THOUGHT." I THINK ONE OF THEM MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE AHEAD OF THEMSELVES. WATCH THIS.
NOTHING WILL EVER BE AS COOL AS CRYSTAL METH?
PEPSI. [ LAUGHTER ] AND --
WHAT DID I --
CRYSTAL PEPSI!
CRYSTAL METH? [ LAUGHTER ]

I'M SORRY. SOME JOKES I JUST HAVE TO MAKE, LEGALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL THIS MADE ME LAUGH. THIS WAS CUTE. A REPORTER WAS TRYING TO SHOOT A STORY OUTSIDE THE OTHER DAY AND SHE GOT A LITTLE DISTRACTED BY CICADAS. THOSE GIANT BUGS. JUST WATCH THIS. [ SCREAMING ]
OKAY. [ SCREAMING ] [ LAUGHTER ]

NO, IT'S GOT SO MANY TWISTS AND TURNS LIKE "INCEPTION." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT IS NOTHING LIKE "INCEPTION." NOT TRUE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST BASICALLY, I GET SEPARATED -- I'M MARRIED TO BRANDY IN IT, FOR THE ONES WHO KNOW WHAT THAT IS. I'M MARRIED TO THE GIRL AND THEN WE GET SEPARATED THE WHOLE MOVIE SO I'M TRYING TO FIND HER AGAIN. CHRISTOPHER WALKEN IS IN IT, PRETTY MUCH THE SAME PEOPLE. SO, IT'S GREAT.
Jimmy: DO YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE FIRST ONE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SECOND ONE?
NO. YOU WON'T GET THE SECOND ONE EITHER WAY. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, IT'S NOT, IT'S GREAT. I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S BETTER. GROSS PEOPLE SAY THAT! BUT I THINK IT'S AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE, LET'S SAY, I THINK.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP HERE. TAKE A LOOK AT "JOE DIRT 2 BEAUTIFUL LOSER." DAVID SPADE.

HEY. IN THE FUTURE I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, IT SOUNDS CRAZY, I KNOW. BUT WE'RE FRIENDS. YOU'RE LIKE A DAD TO ME. I MEAN, WE HANG OUT.
VINNY, WIPE THIS KID. HE'S TALKING NONSENSE. THEN DUMP HIS BODY IN THE TRUNK. THEN DUMP HIS CRAZY HAIR IN A A DIFFERENT TRUCK.
I'M TELLING YOU, I'M FROM THE FUTURE, I'LL PROVE IT. WHAT'S THAT NASCAR? THAT'S DAYTONA 500 I BET. I COULD TELL YOU WHO WINS. IS THAT GOOD?

Jimmy: AND THEN YOU FOLLOWED IT UP WITH A PICTURE.
KEVIN SPACEY IS COVERING HIS FACE.
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT WHY. AND THIS ONE, IT SAID "I CALL THIS ONE KEVIN SPACEY EMBARRASSED TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME." THAT IS NOT TRUE. THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.

IT'S LIKE A YOUNGER VERSION OF "LOST", YEAH.
Jimmy: NETFLIX IS JUST RELEASING ONE A WEEK NOW.

Jimmy: AS OPPOSED TO THE WHOLE --.
YOU COULD BINGE WATCH BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO WAIT, I GUESS, UNTIL ALL OF THEM AIR.
