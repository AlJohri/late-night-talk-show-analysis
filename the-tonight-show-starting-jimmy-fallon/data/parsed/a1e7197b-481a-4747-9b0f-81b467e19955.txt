I AM YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. I SAW THAT AS OF TODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS JUST 100 DAYS LEFT IN OFFICE. BUT HE STILL HAS PLENTY LEFT TO DO. IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT JUST SIGNED A LAW THAT WILL REQUIRE MEN'S RESTROOMS IN FEDERAL BUILDINGS TO HAVE BABY CHANGING TABLES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OR AS MOST GUYS WILL CALL THAT, FINALLY, A PLACE WHERE WE CAN EAT A SANDWICH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M NOT LEAVING. ACTUALLY, WHEN DADS HEARD THERE'S GOING TO BE CHANGING TABLES IN THE MEN'S BATHROOM, THEY WERE LIKE, "THANKS, OBAMA." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GUESS THERE'S A NEW MTV DOCUMENTARY MACKLEMORE, OBAMA SAYS THAT WHEN HE WAS A TEEN, HE DRANK AND DID DRUGS. ADDING, "I PRETTY MUCH TRIED WHATEVER WAS OUT THERE." WHEN ASKED WHAT MADE HIM STOP, OBAMA SAID, "STOP?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, I WANT TO SAY HAPPY 41st WEDDING ANNIVERSARY TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON. THAT'S RIGHT.

Steve: "-- BE STUCK DOING A A ROBERT DE NIRO IMPRESSION FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE OR A A JERRY SEINFELD IMPRESSION FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?"
OH, WOW.
Steve: WHICH ONE DID MORE PEOPLE CHOOSE?
WOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ AS SEINFELD ]
Jimmy: I'D BE DOING THIS ALL THE TIME. YOU DO THIS! I GOT TO SAY, I THINK THEY'D RATHER BE SEINFELD. [ CHEERS ] YES!
WRONG.
Steve: YES! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ THUNDER CLAP ] YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, OF COURSE.
Jimmy: RAIN?
Steve: IT'S TIME FOR THE FINAL DILEMMA. FINAL DILEMMA. THIS QUESTION IS FOR YOU, KEVIN.
OH, WOW.
Steve: YOU GET IT RIGHT, YOU WIN. YOU GET IT WRONG, JIMMY WINS.
I -- I JUST POOPED A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: AND THE LOSER? [ LAUGHTER ]
A LITTLE BIT. JUST A LITTLE BIT.
Steve: ALL DEPENDS. NOW, THE LOSER MUST CHOOSE ONE OF THE TWO DREADED PUNISHMENTS WAITING FOR THEM AT TONIGHT'S LOSER TABLE.
OH MAN. C'MON, MAN.
Steve: KEVIN, HERE IS YOUR QUESTION. WE ASKED "THE TONIGHT SHOW" AUDIENCE, "WOULD YOU RATHER BE ABLE TO SEE INTO THE FUTURE OR READ OTHER PEOPLE'S MINDS?" FINAL CHOICE IS YOURS, KEVIN.
SEE INTO THE FUTURE OR READ OTHER PEOPLE'S MINDS?
Steve: YES.
IF I CAN READ YOUR MIND, CAN'T I TECHNICALLY SEE THE FUTURE?
Steve: NO, YOU CAN SEE THE PRESENT. THAT WOULD BE SEEING THE EXACT PRESENT.
SEE INTO THE FUTURE OR READ OTHER PEOPLES' MINDS. BUT IF I CAN SEE INTO THE FUTURE, I KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT'S COMING. IF I READ YOUR MIND, DOESN'T MEAN I KNOW WHAT YOU DID FOR THAT MOMENT.
Steve: EXACTLY.
YOU KNOW WHAT? OKAY. OKAY. SEE INTO THE FUTURE.
Steve: LET'S SEE WHAT THE AUDIENCE SAYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SEE INTO THE FUTURE! YES! GO TO THE LOSER TABLE. ARE YOU READY?
Jimmy: WHAT IS THE LOSER TABLE? WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO? WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?
I'M SO GLAD THIS WASN'T ME.
Jimmy: WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?
Steve: OKAY, YOU MUST CHOOSE YOUR PUNISHMENT, JIMMY. YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES. ONE IS YOU PICK UP THESE WORMS WITH YOUR BARE HANDS AND HOLD THEM FOR TEN SECONDS. OR NUMBER DOS -- [ SCREAMING ] - EAT A CRICKET. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] THE CHOICE IS YOURS. CRICKET OR WORM? WORM OR CRICKET? OH. OH.
Jimmy: YOU WANT TO EAT ONE WITH ME?
NO, I AIN'T GONNA EAT NO CRICKET. OH, NO.
Jimmy: OH. I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE GOING TO PICK CRICKETS.
OH NO, JIMMY.
Steve: DON'T EAT ME.
NO.

WITHOUT QUESTION --
Jimmy: WITHOUT QUESTION --
WITHOUT QUESTION OR -- WELL, A MINOR HESITATION, A A HORSE-SIZED DUCK.
Jimmy: YOU WOULD FIGHT A A HORSE-SIZED DUCK?
I LIKE TO THINK I'D BE ABLE TO TURN HER AND THEN FLY OFF ON HER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND --
Jimmy: OH, I'VE HEARD -- OH, SEE? YEAH.
AND TOGETHER, WE'D FIGHT ALL THE LITTLE TINY ONES.
Jimmy: YOU'D FIGHT CRIME, YEAH.
ALL THE TINY HORSES.
Jimmy: THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMING OUT. I WAS TELLING YOU BACKSTAGE HOW MUCH I LOVE "FLEABAG." I'VE ONLY SEEN THE FIRST EPISODE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I LIKE TO SPACE IT OUT. I'M NOT A BINGE --
YEA, YEAH.
Jimmy: I DON'T BINGE. I LIKE TO TAKE MY TIME AND I TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT THE SHOW AND EVERYONE I TELL, THEY'RE LIKE, "IT'S THE BEST THING." SO I'M KIND OF LIVING OFF YOUR GOODNESS.
OH, GREAT. HOW'S THAT GOING? IS THAT GOOD?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. BECAUSE YOUR COMEDY IS GREAT. EVERYBODY IS LIKE, "DUDE, I LOVE THAT SHOW." I GO, "YEAH, IT'S OKAY." I WORKED REALLY HARD ON IT. IT'S SUPER FUN. WERE YOU ALWAYS -- DID YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE ON CAMERA OR BE A COMEDIAN? OR WHAT WAS YOUR --
YEAH, I MEAN, I WAS A VERY ATTENTION-SEEKING, IRRITATING CHILD AND I THINK THAT KIND OF MANIFESTED INTO A CAREER IN THE SAME THING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH, I WAS ALWAYS -- WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR. THEN, A WRITER AS WELL. I WAS WRITING -- WELL VERY SORT OF SCRATCHY, WEIRD, VERY WEIRD POETRY AND STUFF AS A CHILD.
Jimmy: SO, YOU DID WRITING AS WELL, AND THEN THIS STARTED AS A ONE-WOMAN SHOW?
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: AND HOW'D YOU COME UP WITH IT? HOW DID IT START? IT STARTS -- WHAT WAS THE OPENING LINE? SOMETHING LIKE --
THE OPENING LINE OF THE PLAY WAS, "THREE NIGHTS AGO I ORDERED MYSELF A VERY SLUTTY PIZZA."
Jimmy: YEAH, WHAT IS A A SLUTTY PIZZA?
FOR ME, IT WAS SORT OF JUST QUITE OBVIOUSLY LIKE A REALLY DIRTY, LIKE, DRIPPY, CHEESY, OILY, LITTLE TART OF A SLICE OF PIZZA. [ LAUGHTER ] "COME ON." ONE THAT WANTS TO BE EATEN SO BADLY.
Jimmy: OH YEAH.
THAT ONE.
Jimmy: THAT ONE.
THAT ONE. THAT PIZZA. YEAH.
Jimmy: IS THIS COMPLETELY BASED ON YOUR ADVENTURES, THIS SHOW, "FLEABAG," OR NOT?
MOST -- SOME -- SOME OF IT.
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU WANT TO TELL US --
YEAH, SOME BITS ARE FROM MY LIFE.
Jimmy: LIKE YOUR DATING ADVENTURES AND DEALING WITH -- YEAH.
I MEAN, NOT -- IN THE SHOW, MY BEST FRIEND AND MOTHER ARE DEAD. THEY ARE NOT IN REAL LIFE. THEY ARE SAFE AND WELL, AND MY BEST FRIEND'S ACTUALLY HERE TONIGHT. SO THAT'S PROOF THAT SHE'S FINE. [ CHEERS ] SO, THE KIND OF -- A LOT OF THE KIND OF DRAMATIC SIDE OF IT ISN'T TRUE BUT A LOT OF THE KIND OF HUMILIATING, HILARIOUS STORIES ARE LIFTED COMPLETELY FROM MY LIFE.
Jimmy: DO YOU FIND YOURSELF WANTING TO BREAK THE FOURTH WALL ALL THE TIME? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. IN THE SCENE -- SOME AWKWARD SCENE WILL HAPPEN, AND YOU LOOK AT THE CAMERA LIKE, "WELL, YOU KNOW," AND YOU JUST TALK TO THE AUDIENCE.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: AND IT'S SO GOOD. IT'S SO WELL DONE. IT'S VERY WELL DIRECTED AND WELL WRITTEN. CONGRATS ON THIS. BUT DO YOU FIND YOURSELF GOING, "I WISH RIGHT I COULD LOOK AT THE CAMERA AND JUST SAY SOMETHING?"
I DO GET A LITTLE, LIKE -- I DO HAVE THE KIND OF LITTLE EVIL "FLEABAG" BUT WITHOUT THE CAMERA, IT LOOKS VERY KIND OF -- VERY AWKWARD AND ODD.
Jimmy: WHAT DID FLEABAG COME FROM? WHAT IS IT --
IT'S ACTUALLY MY FAMILY NICKNAME, WHICH IS A DANGEROUS THING TO ADMIT. BECAUSE IT IMPLIES THAT I AM "FLEABAG," WHICH I'M NOT. BUT I JUST THOUGHT THE NAME -- I HAVE A LOT OF AFFECTION FOR THAT WORD BECAUSE IT WAS MY FAMILY NICKNAME BUT ALSO IT MEANS KIND OF LIKE FLEA-BITTEN, GROSSED OUT, KIND OF CREATURE. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEFINE IT. BUT IT IS -- IT GAVE A NICE SUBTEXT TO THE CHARACTER.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST HILARIOUS AND YOU PLAY IT SO WELL AND YOU'RE JUST VERY -- I -- EVERYONE LOVES YOU WHEN THEY SEE THE SHOW.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: HERE'S A POSTER FOR "FLEABAG." LOOKS VERY SAD. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU DON'T LOOK SO HAPPY THERE, BUT IT'S A VERY -- IT'S A VERY FUNNY, FUNNY SHOW.
THAT'S ME WATCHING THE SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT IT'S VERY, VERY FUNNY. I JUST WILL SAY THAT. WELL, THERE'S SO MANY THINGS. I DON'T WANT TO RUIN ANY OF THE JOKES IF -- FOR THOSE OF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT. I HAVE A CLIP HERE FROM "FLEABAG." CHECK THIS OUT.
THE ONLY THING HARDER THAN HAVING TO TELL YOUR SUPER HIGH-POWERED, PERFECT, ANOREXIC RICH SUPER SISTER THAT YOU'VE RUN OUT OF MONEY IS HAVING TO ASK HER TO BAIL YOU OUT. JUST GOING TO ASK HER. I'M JUST GOING TO ASK HER. I'M JUST GOING TO ASK HER. I'M JUST GOING TO COME --
