Questlove: 564, SEATTLE!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HELLO! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOLA. HI, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE SHOW YOU WANT TO BE WATCHING, AND YOU'RE HERE, YOU MADE IT, AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. HOW GREAT WAS THE GAME LAST NIGHT? OH, MY GOODNESS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER. CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CHICAGO CUBS WHO WON THEIR FIRST WORLD SERIES IN 108 YEARS. OH, MY GOSH. WHEN ASKED HOW IT WAS TO WITNESS HISTORY, CUBS FANS SAID, "I DON'T REMEMBER." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOT NOW. TOO LOUD. THIS WAS BIG, THOUGH. CUBS CATCHER DAVID ROSS BECAME THE OLDEST MAN EVER TO HIT A A HOME RUN IN GAME SEVEN OF THE WORLD SERIES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. IT WAS GREAT. IT WAS A GOOD MOMENT. YOU COULD TELL HE WAS OLD, BECAUSE AFTER THE HOMER, HE USED A STAIR LIFT TO GET BACK INTO THE DUGOUT. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST LOVE THAT STATISTIC, THOUGH. DAVID ROSS IS THE OLDEST PLAYER TO EVER HIT A HOME RUN IN A A GAME SEVEN OF THE WORLD SERIES. IT'S JUST -- MAYBE THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO FILL TIME, BUT THEY WERE JUST SO MANY STATS FROM THE ANNOUNCERS LAST NIGHT. AND SOME OF THEM WERE JUST A A LITTLE RIDICULOUS, VERY SPECIFIC. I MEAN, FOR INSTANCE, THEY SAID CUBS FIRST BASEMAN ANTHONY RIZZO HAS A POSTSEASON SLUGGING PERCENTAGE OF .492, WHICH IS ALSO THE VERIFICATION CODE ON HIS MASTERCARD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO KNOW THAT.
Steve: WHY WOULD THEY TELL YOU THAT?
Jimmy: THEY SAID IT. THEY ALSO CLAIMED CLEVELAND'S MIKE NAPOLI IS THE ONLY PLAYER TO GROUND INTO A DOUBLE PLAY IN THE SAME MONTH THAT "GILMORE GIRLS" PREMIERS ON NETFLIX. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S TRUE, BUT --
Steve: YOU NEED IT.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW.
Steve: IT HELPS ME.
Jimmy: THEN THEY SAID THE INDIANS OUTFIELDER ,COCO CRISP IS THE FIRST PLAYER IN WORLD SERIES HISTORY TO DOUBLE TWICE OFF THE SAME PITCHER, WHILE ALSO BEING NAMED AFTER A SUGARY BREAKFAST CEREAL. [ APPLAUSE ] OKAY, THAT ONE I'LL GIVE THEM.
Steve: THAT ONE'S GOOD.
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, THEY MENTIONED THE TARP USED DURING LAST NIGHT'S RAIN DELAY WAS ONCE A PONCHO WORN BY NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE. THAT'S NOT TRUE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] .
Steve: THAT CANNOT BE TRUE.
Jimmy: THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S TRUE. [ APPLAUSE ] ANOTHER BIG STORY IS THAT CUBS TEAM PRESIDENT, THEO EPSTEIN, HOW ABOUT THIS GUY, UNBELIEVABLE. HE'S NOW ENDED WORLD SERIES DROUGHTS FOR BOTH THE CHICAGO CUBS AND THE BOSTON RED SOX. WOW. NOW HE'S GOING TO TAKE ON HIS TOUGHEST JOB YET, PRESIDENT OF RADIO SHACK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO DO IT. ACTUALLY, THEO EPSTEIN SAID LAST NIGHT THAT HE'S GOING ON A A MONTH-LONG BENDER TO CELEBRATE. AND HILLARY SAID, "IF YOU CAN WAIT FIVE MORE DAYS, I'LL JOIN YOU." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT HILLARY DID REALLY SEND OUT A TWEET CONGRATULATING THE CUBS ON WINNING, AND THEN TRUMP SENT OUT A TWEET CRITICIZING THE INDIANS FOR PUTTING HIS CASINOS OUT OF BUSINESS. HE GOT THE WRONG -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT IN HER TWEET, HILLARY TOLD THE CUBS, "WAY TO MAKE HISTORY." HILLARY SAID NOTHING IS MORE INSPIRING TO HER THAN SEEING SOMEONE BLOW A LEAD, COME BACK, THEN BLOW IT AGAIN, THEN SOMEHOW STILL WIN THE WHOLE THING. THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT A NEW POLL SHOWS THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS AHEAD OF DONALD TRUMP IN COLORADO BY THREE POINTS. THEN PEOPLE IN COLORADO SAID, "BUT WITH TWO MORE MONTHS TO GO IN THIS THING, WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GET THIS. I READ THAT BOTH DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON'S ELECTION NIGHT PARTIES WILL BE HELD HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND WIN OR LOSE, THE DANCING WILL BE TERRIBLE AT BOTH OF THEM. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THE ONLY -- THE ONLY DANCE I KNOW. I WAS A NEW KID FOR A WHILE.
Steve: YOU WERE, FOR TWO WEEKS.
Jimmy: THIS WAS KIND OF SURPRISING. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" MAGAZINE SAID AS OF THIS SUMMER, BILL CLINTON STILL HAD A LOCKER AT DONALD TRUMP'S WESTCHESTER GOLF CLUB. EVEN STRANGER, IT WAS IN THE WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OOPS, DID I COME IN HERE BY MISTAKE AGAIN? ♪♪ MY BAD. [ LAUGHTER ] I SHOULD JUST STAY. I MEAN -- [ LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, I READ THAT IF HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES PRESIDENT, SHE HAS PLEDGED THAT HAD 50% OF HER CABINET WILL BE FEMALE. [ CHEERS ] AND CRITICS SAY SHE SHOULD JUST PICK THE PEOPLE WHO'D BE BEST AT THE JOB. THEN HILLARY WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE RIGHT, IT SHOULD BE 100% FEMALE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

SO, SINCE THE CHICAGO CUBS FINALLY WON THE WORLD SERIES LAST NIGHT -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -- EVEN THOUGH SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT MIGHT NEVER HAPPEN, I WENT ON TWITTER AND SENT OUT A HASHTAG CALLED, THAT HAPPENED.

AND SO ALBERTINO IS SO SUPERSTITIOUS. SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD TO WATCH THE WHOLE GAME SQUATTING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EVERY TIME SHE'D SIT UP, THEY'D SCORE A RUN OR SOMETHING. SO SHE SAT THE WHOLE GAME WATCHING LIKE THAT, LIKE, FREAKING OUT. AND THEN QUESTLOVE CAME AND MAYBE STAYED FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES.
Questlove: YEAH. I LEFT BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS JINXING THE GAME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: QUESTLOVE CAME AND THE INDIANS SCORED THREE RUNS AND TIED IT UP.
Questlove: IT'S KNOWN THAT I JINX GAMES. ANY GAME THAT I WATCH, I JINX.

Jimmy: YEAH.
HIS HEAD COULD FALL OFF. HE COULD HAVE A VERY RARE FORM OF CANCER. HE COULD BE TOTALLY INFECTIOUS. NOW WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THE RESULTS OF HIS BLOOD DRAW YET, BUT WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE DREW HIS BLOOD AND BLOOD DRAWS CAN SHOW CRAZY STUFF.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
SO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS LIKE, WOW, SHOULD WE HIRE JIMMY? LIKE THIS SOUNDS CRAZY. BUT THEY WENT TO CONGRESS. WHAT THE FBI DIRECTOR DID IS HE WENT TO CONGRESS SAYING, I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ANYTHING AT ALL. JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THERE'S RULES ABOUT THE FBI NOT DOING STUFF LIKE THAT. THE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT --
Jimmy: TAMPER WITH THE ELECTION.
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO STUFF THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION. AND IN THIS CASE, IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WHAT THE FBI'S TRYING TO DO.
Jimmy: AND ARE POLL NUMBERS BEING AFFECTED BY THIS?
YEAH. TOTALLY, YEP. I MEAN THE THING TO WATCH AT THIS POINT, THE FIRST THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT MORE THAN 30 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED. SO, IF STUFF HAPPENING IN THE LAST FEW DAYS IS GOING TO INFLUENCE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ELECTION, FOR THOSE 30 MILLION PEOPLE, THEY CAN STOP PAYING ATTENTION. IT'S FINE. THEY'VE ALREADY CAST THEIR VOTE.
Jimmy: NO, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE OUR VOTES. HE TWEETED OUT, YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR VOTE IN SIX STATES AND IF YOU REALIZE IT WAS A MISTAKES, HE DID THIS ONCE WITH "DANCING WITH THE STARS" WHEN -- [ LAUGHTER ] JAY GOSSELIN, HE WAS TRYING TO PICK JAY GOSSELIN, DID THE SAME THING.
CHANGE YOUR VOTE AMERICA.
Jimmy: IT IS LEGAL.
THIS IS SO WEIRD. THIS IS -- I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? HEY, IF YOU'VE EARLY VOTED, WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS I WANT YOU TO GO TO YOUR LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS, FILL OUT SOME PAPERWORK, SEE IF YOU CAN PERSUADE THEM TO GO FIND THE VOTE YOU SENT IN A FEW WEEKS AGO AND IF THEY COULD FIND IT, THEY SHOULD VOID IT. AND THEN YOU WANT TO GO BACK ON ELECTION DAY AGAIN. AND THEN VOTE AGAIN BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING THAT WHEN YOU WANT TO VOTE AGAIN, YOU MIGHT VOTE DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU DID THE FIRST TIME.
Jimmy: TRYING EVERYTHING THOUGH, RIGHT.
IT'S SUCH A ROUND ABOUT WAY TO TRY TO WIN THE ELECTION. IT'S A REALLY -- IT'S A WEIRD THING. THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT THE WAY OUR GOVERNMENT AND ELECTIONS WORK THAT I THINK DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T GET.
Jimmy: WELL, I MEAN, THE THING ABOUT, I'LL KEEP IT IN SUSPENSE TOO.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT WAS INTERESTING.
WE'VE NEVER HAD -- THE REASON -- SO, HE SAID, I'LL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE MEANING, IF IT LOOKS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON WINS THE ELECTION, I'LL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I'LL ACTUALLY CONCEDE AND ADMIT THAT SHE'S PRESIDENT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS MADE US THE OLDEST DEMOCRACY ON EARTH AND ONE OF THE GREATEST COUNTRIES. RIGHT, EVER IN THE HISTORY OF COUNTRIES. IS THAT WE HAVE A PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER, AND WE HAVE THESE INCREDIBLE CONTESTS THAT ARE LIKE REALLY HARD FOUGHT. AND SOMETIMES A LITTLE DIRTY AND EVERYTHING TO TRY TO SEE WHO'S GOING TO BE PRESIDENT. BUT THEN ONCE YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDED, YOU DON'T KILL THE PERSON WHO LOST AND YOU DON'T LOCK THEM UP. THEY LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY. YOU SHAKE HANDS. BUT EVEN THE PERSON WHO LOST SAYS, WELL, I RECOGNIZE THIS AS MY NEW PRESIDENT. THIS IS MY COMMANDER IN CHIEF. THE COUNTRY MOVES ON. WE ACCEPT. THAT'S HOW WE GET NEW POWER IN THIS COUNTRY.
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
IF THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE, TRUMP IS SAYING, I WILL ACCEPT THE ELECTION RESULTS IF I WIN. AND IF I DON'T, I MEAN, WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO? IS HE GOING TO TELL PEOPLE, HILLARY CLINTON ISN'T REALLY THE PRESIDENT, I'M SECRETLY THE PRESIDENT, DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE HER AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF? THE MILITARY SHOULD MUTINY. I'M REALLY THE PRESIDENT. BECAUSE I KNOW -- I MEAN, THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER, EVER BEEN THROUGH AS A COUNTRY BEFORE, AND IF HE'S GOING TO TRY TO PULL THAT OFF, WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY.
Jimmy: I JUST SAY, I THINK YOU'RE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB AND BRIAN WILLIAMS, I LIKE YOU GUYS TOGETHER.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I LOVE YOU WORKED SO WELL TOGETHER AND YOU'VE DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE KEEPING THE ENERGY UP, BUT KEEP GOING.
I'M EXCITED. IT'S SCARY, BUT IT'S EXCITING TOO. I MEAN THIS IS A COLLECTIVE DECISION WE'RE MAKING AS A A COUNTRY. IT'S MAYBE MORE IMPORTANT THAN USUAL THIS TIME AROUND. BUT IT IS -- JUST ANYBODY WHO'S FEELING OVERWHELMED OR DEPRESSED ABOUT IT, OR WHATEVER, THERE'S A REASON TO BE EXCITED ABOUT IT. WHICH IS THAT IT'S UP TO US NOW. LIKE, WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE WHO'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT IN THESE CANDIDATES, IT'S UP TO US. NOW'S THE TIME WHEN YOU GET TO ACTUALLY DO IT. AND THAT'S EXCITING. LEGITIMATELY EXCITING. WE SHOULD ALL BE PSYCHED TO VOTE.
