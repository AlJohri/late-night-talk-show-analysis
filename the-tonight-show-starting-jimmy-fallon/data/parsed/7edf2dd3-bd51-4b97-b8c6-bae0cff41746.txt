Questlove: 520. TUCSON!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS! THAT IS A CROWD. THAT IS A CROWD RIGHT THERE. HOT CROWD! FANTASTIC NEW YORK CITY CROWD RIGHT THERE TONIGHT! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU MADE IT. THIS IS IT. YOU'RE PART OF THE SHOW. WHAT A SHOW TONIGHT. BUT FIRST, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. OF COURSE, EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTION. AND GET THIS, "POLITICO" IS NOW REPORTING THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IS USING A RUN-OUT-THE-CLOCK STRATEGY AGAINST DONALD TRUMP HOPING TO JUST OUTLAST HIM UNTIL NOVEMBER. "SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLAN," SAID TED CRUZ, MARCO RUBIO, JEB BUSH, AND JOHN KASICH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] REAL GOOD PLAN. I SAW THAT HILLARY HELD A A FUNDRAISER RECENTLY AT JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE AND JESSICA BIEL'S HOUSE -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I KNOW JESSICA BIEL. WHO'S JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] JESSICA EVEN POSTED A A PHOTOBOOTH SERIES THEY ALL TOOK TOGETHER. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. ISN'T THAT CUTE? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HILLARY'S FACES IN THOSE PICTURES ARE ACTUALLY THE STAGES TO REACTING TO DONALD TRUMP RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. CAN WE SEE THAT AGAIN? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AT FIRST -- AT FIRST, IT'S FUNNY AND IT MAKES YOU SMILE. THEN YOU CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE'S SAYING. THEN YOU'RE TERRIFIED HE MIGHT WIN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND, FINALLY, LOOK AT THE LATEST POLLS, AND YOU BREATHE A A SIGH OF RELIEF. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP ISN'T LETTING UP. IN FACT, HE TOOK A FEW SHOTS AT HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN YESTERDAY, SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE CELEBRITIES WHO ARE SUPPORTING HER. LISTEN TO THIS RIGHT HERE.
HER SUPPORTS HAVE REALLY -- AND HER SUPPORTERS HAVE VERY LITTLE ENTHUSIASM. THE ONLY PEOPLE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HER CAMPAIGN ARE HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES. IN MANY CASES, CELEBRITIES THAT AREN'T VERY HOT ANYMORE. [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: "YES, UNLIKE THE SMOKING HOT CELEBRITIES SUPPORTING ME RIGHT NOW, LIKE SCOTT BAIO AND THE ONE GUY FROM 'DUCK DYNASTY,' THAT'S IT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HOT, HOT CELEBRITIES. TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO MAKE DECISIONS BY PLAYING HOT OR NOT WITH WORLD LEADERS. LIKE, "ANGELA MERKEL, NOT HOT. VLADIMIR PUTIN, VERY HOT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND DID YOU SEE THIS? THE "BOSTON GLOBE" JUST REPORTED THAT ACCORDING TO HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF, DONALD TRUMP WOULDN'T TAKE ANY VACATIONS AS PRESIDENT. I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S OFFENDED SO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HE CAN'T LEAVE THIS ONE. WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO?
Steve: WHERE YOU GONNA GO?
Jimmy: HEY, I SAW THAT THE U.S. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE TURNED 100 YEARS OLD TODAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WOW. ISN'T THAT AMAZING? FOR 100 YEARS, FAMILIES FROM ALL OVER THE U.S. HAVE BEEN TRAVELING TO THE GRAND CANYON SAYING, "HUH, OKAY, WELL, BACK IN THE R.V. LET'S GO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S IT. IT'S A CANYON. IT'S A HOLE. LET'S GO." WELL, THIS IS PRETTY FUNNY. KIM KARDASHIAN RECENTLY ATTENDED A FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY IN MEXICO AND APPARENTLY BROUGHT A PIÑATA THAT WAS MODELED AFTER HER BUTT. [ LAUGHTER ] AFTERWARDS ALL THE KIDS IN THE VILLAGE WERE PICKING UP CANDY AND SO WERE THE KIDS IN THE NEXT VILLAGE. IT WAS A BIG -- IT WAS A GREAT, FUN PARTY. OH, A BIT OF A SCANDAL HERE, YOU GUYS. I READ THAT "BACHELORETTE" WINNER JORDAN ROGERS'S TINDER ACCOUNT IS STILL ACTIVE. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] AND THAT HE RECENTLY MATCHED WITH A GIRL DESPITE BEING ENGAGED IN JOJO. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] JOJO SAID, "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D CHEAT ON ME." AND ROGERS SAID, "YOU DATED 25 OTHER GUYS WHILE WE WERE GOING OUT. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT?" I JUST DON'T KNOW. ANOTHER REALITY STAR, KIM RICHARDS OF "THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF BEVERLY HILLS" JUST AVOIDED JAIL TIME FOR SHOPLIFTING AT A TARGET STORE LAST YEAR. INSTEAD, SHE'LL BE MOVED TO A A WORK RELEASE PROGRAM FOR FELONS, "THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'LL FLIP THIS TABLE! CHECK THIS OUT. "HOLLYWOOD MEDIUM" STAR TYLER HENRY SAYS THAT HIS PSYCHIC ABILITIES HELP HIM ON DATES, BECAUSE HE CAN ALWAYS TELL IF THERE'S GONNA BE A A SECOND DATE OR NOT. WHICH, RAISES THE QUESTION, IF YOU ARE PSYCHIC, WHY WOULD YOU EVEN BOTHER SHOWING UP FOR A A BAD FIRST DATE. [ APPLAUSE ] "I HAVE A FEELING THIS IS GOING TO STINK. UH, I'M SICK." I THOUGHT THIS WAS PRETTY AMAZING. ASTRONAUT JEFFREY WILLIAMS JUST SET THE U.S. RECORD FOR MOST DAYS IN SPACE, REACHING THE MILESTONE OF 521 DAYS. IT'S LESS OF AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AFTER NASA ADMITTED THEY SORT OF FORGOT HE WAS UP THERE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "HEY, THAT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING JEFF WOULD SAY. OH, MY GOD! WHERE'S JEFF? JEFF, CAN YOU HEAR US? I TOTALLY FORGOT! ARE YOU OKAY?" "HOME ALONE 5: IN SPACE."
Steve: NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU SCREAM! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, HERE'S A A NICE LOCAL STORY. A DOG HERE IN NEW YORK CITY IS GOING VIRAL FOR GIVING STRANGERS HUGS ON THE STREET. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] HERE, TAKE A LOOK. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] THE DOG'S OWNER WAS, LIKE, "YEAH, HUGS. THAT'S WHAT THOSE ARE, SURE, LITTLE QUICK HUGS." WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

SHE'S WON MULTIPLE ACADEMY, GOLDEN GLOBE, AND EMMY AWARDS AS WELL AS A TONY. AND AT MIDNIGHT, TONIGHT, SHE DROPS HER NEW ALBUM, "ENCORE: MOVIE PARTNERS SING BROADWAY."

WE LOVE THIS MAN AS WELL, HE'S A TALENTED, TALENTED ACTOR. HE'S VERY SMART, VERY FUNNY. HE'S JUST GOT IT ALL. AND IT TURNS OUT HE CAN REALLY SING TOO. OUR PAL, ALEC BALDWIN IS DROPPING IN TONIGHT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN -- NO, IT GETS BETTER!
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: IT GETS BETTER THAN THAT!
Steve: WHAT? WE'RE GONNA CATCH UP WITH ALEC BALDWIN WHO IS JUST HITTING HOMERS LEFT AND RIGHT. AND THEN BARBRA AND ALEC ARE GOING TO SING A FANTASTIC DUET OFF HER THE NEW ALBUM.

Jimmy: THAT IS CORRECT. GUYS, IF YOU WATCH OUR SHOW, AND YOU WANT TO PLAY ALONG, WE DO THIS THING EVERY WEDNESDAY WHERE I SEND OUT A HASHTAG AND WE ASK YOU GUYS TO TWEET OUT THINGS BASED ON THAT TOPIC. SO SINCE RYAN LOCHTE HAS GOTTEN IN SOME TROUBLE.
Steve: A LITTLE HOT WATER.
Jimmy: FOR LYING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM IN RIO. I WENT ON TWITTER AND SENT OUT A HASHTAG CALLED "MY DUMB LIE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I ASKED YOU GUYS TO TWEET OUT A FUNNY, WEIRD, OR EMBARRASSING LIE THAT YOU'VE TOLD. WE GOT THOUSANDS OF TWEETS.

Jimmy: THAT LITTLE TIME TO THINK OF IT. WHY DO I GOT TO DO THAT I COULD'VE HAVE TAKEN THE STAIRS. THIS IS FROM @EDFABRY. HE SAID, "WHILE WORKING IN SPAIN, I TOLD MY SPANISH ROOMMATE THAT THE PROPER ENGLISH RESPONSE TO SOMEONE SNEEZING IS 'UP YOURS.'" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHY? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
Steve: THAT'S JUST RUDE. THAT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL.
