Steve: YEAH!
Jimmy: I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S THAT SPECIAL TIME OF YEAR WHEN PEOPLE USE A TWO MINUTE EVENT AS AN EXCUSE TO DRINK FOR TWELVE HOURS. [ CHEERS ] IT'S REALLY FUN. MINT JULEPS. AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE KENTUCKY DERBY IS A RACE THAT LETS RICH PEOPLE THROW MONEY AT A BUNCH OF WEIRD SOUNDING NAMES, WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF DESCRIBING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE SO FAR. IT WAS LIKE, JEB, RAND? I HEARD THAT THE FAVORITE TO WIN THE DERBY IS A HORSE CALLED AMERICAN PHARAOH, FOLLOWED BY DORTMUND AND CARPE DIEM. PICKED TO FINISH LAST IS GLUESTICK MCTACOMEAT. I DON'T WANT TO BET ON THAT.
Steve: NO.
Jimmy: SOUNDS LIKE A LONG SHOT.
Steve: A REALLY LONG SHOT.
Jimmy: SOUNDS LIKE A LONG SHOT. AND GET THIS. I READ THAT CHURCHILL DOWNS, WHICH HOSTS THE KENTUCKY DERBY, HAS BANNED THE USE OF SELFIE STICKS THIS YEAR. OFFICIALS SAY THAT IF YOU WANT TO BLOCK SOMEONE'S VIEW OF THE RACE, JUST DO WHAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES AND WEAR AN INSANELY GIANT HAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, SPORTS FANS ARE GEARING UP FOR A TON OF EVENTS TOMORROW, INCLUDING THE MAYWEATHER-PACQUIAO FIGHT. [ CHEERS ] THAT'S TOMORROW. THE DERBY, THE NFL DRAFT.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] UH -- AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TRASH-TALKING LEADING UP TO THE MAYWEATHER-PACQUIAO FIGHT.

[ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WHEN ASKED WHY, ROACH WAS LIKE, "HE ONLY CLICKED 'MAYBE' ON MY FACEBOOK INVITE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. AND HERE'S A LITTLE MORE SPORTS CONTROVERSY.

HE IS STILL TEACHING ACTING. HE'LL BE TEACHING TOMORROW MORNING. HE'S THE BEST.
Jimmy: HE WAS THE GREATEST TEACHER, BUT I WAS A BAD STUDENT. BECAUSE -- I'LL TELL YOU WHY, BECAUSE AT THE TIME, I WAS REALLY INTO -- I WANTED TO BE RIVER PHOENIX OR JAMES DEAN. I WAS REALLY INTO THESE GUYS. SO I READ THESE BOOKS ABOUT JAMES DEAN, AND THEY SAID HE WOULD NEVER, HE WOULD GO TO ACTING CLASSES BUT HE WOULDN'T PARTICIPATE. HE WOULD SIT IN THE BACK AND OBSERVE. AND SO, THAT'S WHAT I DID.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DID? [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: DID IT EVER GET AWKWARD, SINCE YOU'RE --
FOR THE FIRST SET OF YEARS IT DID GET AWKWARD, BECAUSE I WAS DOING LITTLE SCENES FROM, YOU KNOW, YOUNG PARTS. AND THEN LATER I -- A COUPLE OF TIMES, I'D HAVE SOME ROMANTIC SCENES TO DO. AND I WOULD JUST PRETEND -- EVERYBODY PRETENDED IT WASN'T HAPPENING. HE'S NOT YOUR DAD, THAT'S NOT MY DAD. IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S OKAY.
Jimmy: IT'S FINE.
YEAH, IT'S TOTALLY FINE.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT WE DO, WE'RE ACTORS.
IT'S NOT AWKWARD AT ALL.
Jimmy: NO.
AND I DID A SCENE FROM A A THIS SAM SHEPARD PLAY, WHICH IS THIS SORT OF STEAMY -- THEY'RE SUPPOSE TO HAVE ALL THIS CHEMISTRY, AND THEY WANT TO RIP EACH OTHER'S CLOTHES OFF. AND I WAS WORKING WITH THIS WONDERFUL HANDSOME ACTOR, AND WE HAD ZERO CHEMISTRY, I DON'T KNOW WHY. I DON'T KNOW WHY. AND MY DAD SAID, SO YOU HAVE ZERO CHEMISTRY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOES ON BUT, YOU BETTER JUST FIGURE IT OUT. GO OUT ON A DATE, DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO, DON'T TELL ME.

Jimmy: YOU WROTE, DIRECTED, AND STARRED IN IT. THAT'S A LOT OF WORK.
IT'S A LOT OF WORK.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH, IT'S -- ACTING IN A MOVIE IS A LOT OF WORK, BUT ALSO, IN THIS MOVIE YOU'RE SURFING IN THE MOVIE. AND I WOULD THINK THAT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT THING TO SHOOT, ANYTHING IN THE WATER.
YEAH, WELL IT'S AN INDEPENDENT MOVIE, WHICH IS, LIKE SORT OF AN ELEGANT WAY TO SAY WE HAD VERY LITTLE MONEY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT'S AN INDIE.
Jimmy: YEAH, AN INDIE. COOLER NAME.
CAN WE HAVE $5 SO WE CAN BUY DIET COKE FOR PEOPLE? SO, IT WAS ALL ABOUT SAVING TIME, SHOOTING QUICKLY, AND WE WERE SHOOTING IN THE WATER FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS. THIS LITTLE CREW OF STUNTMEN AND WATER CAMERAMEN AND ME. AND I REALIZED WHEN I HAVE TO PEE, WHICH HAPPENS. EVEN I, AS HARD AS IT IS TO BELIEVE.
Jimmy: THE HELEN HUNT --
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY EVERYBODY WAIT, I'M GONNA GET OUT OF THE WATER, I'M GOING TO RUN 300 YARDS TO WHERE OUR TRAILERS ARE. SO WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU PEE IN YOUR -- EVERYBODY PEES IN THEIR WET SUIT.
Jimmy: SURE.
DO YOU PEE IN THE OCEAN? YOU PEE IN THE OCEAN. YOU PEE IN THE POOL.
Jimmy: I DON'T PEE IN THE POOL.
REALLY? I THINK EVERYBODY SAYS THEY DON'T PEE IN THE POOL AND MANY PEOPLE PEE IN THE POOL.
Jimmy: I THINK IT'S A GOOD THEORY BUT NOT ME.
I DON'T EITHER.
Jimmy: I DON'T DO IT.
SEE, IT'S PERFECT.
Jimmy: IT'S PEOPLE LIKE US. WE REALLY GET ALONG. THIS IS FANTASTIC, YEAH. BUT IN THE OCEAN, YOU GO FOR IT.
YEAH. SO FIRST, I WAS --
Jimmy: WHY NOT? THE FISH ARE DOING IT.
EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
AT FIRST I WOULD SORT OF SECRETLY PEE. AND THEN, AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS I WOULD SAY EVERYBODY JUST SO YOU KNOW, THE CAMERA GOES HERE, I'M PEEING BY THE WAY. [ LAUGHTER ] PEEING RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: AS YOU'RE DOING THE SCENE.
YEAH, WHATEVER. AND THEN, I WOULD BE ON THE BEACH AND I'M ALL WET IN THE WET SUIT AND I'M LIKE, "I'M GOING TO PEE RIGHT NOW. STANDING ON THE BEACH, NO ONE'S GOING TO KNOW."
Jimmy: YOU WERE IN A WET SUIT.
WHATEVER.
Jimmy: WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET THIS OPPORTUNITY?
EXACTLY. AND THEN LATER, I'M SHOOTING A A SCENE WITH LUKE WILSON IN THE PARKING LOT WITH DRY HAIR, DRY HEAD TO TOE. AND MY CLOSEST GIRLFRIEND CAME TO VISIT, AND I SAID TO HER, YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN PEEING MY WAY THROUGH THIS WHOLE MOVIE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME TO SHOOT THIS SCENE, AND SHE SAYS "YOU LISTEN RIGHT NOW, YOU WILL NOT PEE IN FRONT OF 50 PEOPLE AND LUKE WILSON. THIS IS A LINE YOU WILL NOT CROSS." OKAY, OKAY, I WILL FIND A A PLACE.
Jimmy: YOU WILL GO TO THE BATHROOM LIKE A HUMAN BEING.
LIKE A HUMAN BEING AND PEE PROPERLY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHICH I DID.
Jimmy: VERY GOOD FOR YOU.
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: GOOD FRIENDS LIKE THAT. SO YOU GET FRIENDS LIKE THAT. YEAH, I -- I FOUND THE MOVIE TO BE REFRESHING, BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN A MOVIE LIKE THIS IN A LONG TIME. IT'S ALMOST LIKE A A MOTHER/SON --
LOVE STORY IN A WAY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT IT TO BE.
Jimmy: AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE, YOU'RE A WRITER AND YOU WANT HIM TO BE A WRITER AND HE'S GOING TO COLLEGE. AND YOU GO, OKAY I GET THIS. AND THEN HE GOES OFF TO BE WITH HIS DAD, AND KIND OF FINDS HIS OWN WAY. AND I HAVE KIDS AND I STARTED THINKING, AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY DO --
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S A TERRIBLE SET UP. YOU HAVE CHILDREN, YOU'RE FLOODED WITH SOME CHEMICAL THAT MAKES YOU DO ANYTHING FOR THEM FOREVER. AND IF YOU DO IT WELL, THEY GO "I'LL SEE YOU LATER." [ LAUGHTER ] AND IF YOU DO IT REALLY WELL THEY DON'T LOOK BACK AND WORRY ABOUT YOU. SO IT'S A RIDICULOUS SET UP.
Jimmy: AND IT'S LIKE, I GUESS YOU JUST HAVE TO LET YOUR KID THINK FOR THEMSELVES AT SOME POINT.
NECESSARY, BUT WHATEVER, WE'LL SEE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHATEVER, THINK FOR THEMSELVES.
Jimmy: AT THIS POINT, YEAH WE'RE ALL JUST PEEING IN OUR WET SUITS IN THE HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST BABIES NOW, YEAH. I LOVED IT, I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT, AND IT WAS REALLY COOL. AND YOU'RE A PRETTY GOOD SURFER BY THE WAY.
I WIPE OUT BRILLIANTLY IN THIS MOVIE, I WILL SAY, AND I STOOD UP ON THAT BOARD AND SURFED QUITE A BIT.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND WHERE DID YOU SHOOT THAT? BY THE WAY.
IN L.A. ALL UP AND DOWN THE BEACHES OF L.A.
Jimmy: JUST IN MALIBU?
ALL OF THAT PEE, I'M REALIZING NOW. YES.
Jimmy: YOUR PEE IS ALL OVER L.A. ALL OVER.
ALL OVER L.A.
Jimmy: YOU, YOURSELF CAN GO -- NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S TERRIBLE, LET'S DROP IT. IT'S NOT GOOD.
Jimmy: LET'S JUST NOT GO THERE.
WE'LL WALK AWAY.
Jimmy: OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'VE GOT TO GIVE PROPS TO NEPTUNE'S NET.
RIGHT?
Jimmy: THAT'S MY FAVORITE PLACE. I LOVE THAT SURFER PLACE OUT IN MALIBU?
YEAH, NORTH MALIBU. I WROTE IT FOR NEPTUNE'S NET, AND THEY SAID WE CAN NEVER GET NEPTUNE'S NET. AND THIS IS HOW YOU DO AN INDEPENDENT MOVIE. YOU SAY, OKAY, BUT CAN WE SHOOT AT NEPTUNE'S NET?
