Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WOW, BY FAR THE HOTTEST CROWD, OH MY GOSH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT WAS AMAZING! HOT CROWD! WELCOME EVERYBODY! WELCOME. WELCOME WELCOME WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." HEY. LOOKING GOOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE! WELCOME EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOU GUYS, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A HEAT WAVE HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, AND TEMPERATURES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE 90'S FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. DONALD TRUMP WAS SO MAD ABOUT THE WEATHER, HE ACTUALLY GAVE AWAY AL ROKER'S PERSONAL PHONE NUMBER. [ APPLAUSE ] GOOD, YOU KNOW. IF IT MAKES A CHANGE, I DON'T KNOW MAN. BUT DONALD TRUMP IS ALL ANYONE IS TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. THIS WEEK, TRUMP SAID, "IF HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN FAILS, HE WILL 'RIDE INTO THE SUNSET'." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND IF DONALD TRUMP WINS THE PRESIDENCY, HILLARY SAYS SHE'S GONNA RIDE OFF A CLIFF LIKE "THELMA AND LOUISE." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. [ APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE THE "NEW YORK TIMES" HAS RELEASED TESTIMONY OF COURT CASES DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN. AND THEY REVEAL THAT TRUMP RARELY SENDS E-MAILS OR TEXT MESSAGES. IN FAIRNESS, IT'S A LOT EASIER TO COMMUNICATE IN PERSON WHEN YOU'RE A HUMAN EMOJI. [ LAUGHTER ] BEAUTIFUL. [ LAUGHTER ] FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR, JIM GILMORE, OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED HIS CAMPAIGN YESTERDAY, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TO 17. 17. HERE'S HOW I KNOW THAT'S TOO MANY. IF I SAW 17 PEOPLE IN LINE FOR THE BATHROOM I'D BE LIKE, "NO." [ LAUGHTER ] I'LL WAIT. I'LL WAIT TIL 2020. I DON'T CARE. I'LL WAIT. COURSE IN THE FIELD OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDITATES, WHICH IS ALREADY VERY LARGE, BUT NOW GILMORE JUST HAD TO RUN. HE HAD TO RUN. REMEMBER HOW PEOPLE JUST WENT NUTS THE LAST TIME GILMORE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I ANNOUNCE TO YOU TODAY, THAT I AM A CANDIDATE FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES IN 2008. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PLEASE HOLD YOUR DISINTEREST. GUYS, AS HILLARY CLINTON'S POLL NUMBERS CONTINUE TO SLIDE, THE MOVEMENT TO CONVINCE JOE BIDEN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT HAS BEEN GAINING STEAM. WHICH MIGHT SOUND LIKE A JOKE BUT THE PAY-PER-VIEW ON A A BIDEN/ TRUMP DEBATE WOULD SOLVE THE NATIONAL DEBT CRISIS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD IDEA. YOU KNOW YOU'D WATCH. I'D WATCH. [ APPLAUSE ] OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD, YOU GUYS. DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN, CHAKA FATTAH OF PENNSYLVANIA, COULD FACE MORE THAN 100 YEARS IN JAIL AFTER HE WAS CHARGED WITH SEVERAL COUNTS OF CORRUPTION. WHICH COULD EXPLAIN CHAKA'S NEW NAME "CHAKA CON." [ LAUGHTER ] CHAKA -- CHAKA. CHAKA CON. ♪ CHAKA CON LET ME RAP IT LET RAP IT CHAKA CON ♪ ♪ LET ME RAP IT IT'S ALL I WANNA DO CHAKA CON ♪ LET ME RAP IT LET ME RAP IT CHAKA CON ♪ ♪ LET ME RAP IT LET ME FEEL FOR YOU LET ME TAKE YOU IN YOUR ARMS CHAKA CON ♪ ♪ CAUSE YOU KNOW I'M THE ONE TO KEEP YOU WARM CHAKA I'LL KEEP YA WARM ♪ ♪ IT'S A PHYSICAL THING NEW LOVE IS LIKE A BABY BECAUSE IT MAKES YA WANNA SING ♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SONG?

NEWSPAPER, "THE HILL", PUBLISHED ITS ANNUAL LIST OF THE 50 MOST BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE IN POLITICS YESTERDAY. AND ONCE AGAIN, IT ONLY HAD FIVE PEOPLE ON IT. [ LAUGHTER ] MAKE THE LIST SHORTER. LET'S MAKE THE LIST SHORTER.
Steve: HEY, TOP FIVE.
Jimmy: A CRAZY STORY OUT OF ENGLAND, A BABY SEAL WAS RESCUED AFTER IT WAS FOUND ON LAND IN THE MIDDLE OF A GROUP OF COWS. THE SEAL SAYS SHE WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUNCH OF COWS FOR THE SAME REASON MOST PEOPLE DO. IT LOOKS BETTER IN HER INSTAGRAM PHOTOS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS WEEK, A PANDA NAMED JIA JIA TURNED 37 IN HONG KONG. SET THE GUINESS WORLD RECORD FOR THE OLDEST PANDA EVER TO LIVE IN CAPTIVITY. YEAH. SHE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED IN HUMAN YEARS AND MUCH OLDER THAN THE AVERAGE PANDA LIFE EXPECTANCY -- ♪♪ ♪♪ HEY. HASHTAG! "HASHTAG THE PANDA", LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO WORD ON WHEN THEY WILL TEAR IT DOWN, BUT THEY'RE ASKING PASSENGERS NOT TO LEAN TOO HARD AGAINST THE WALLS. GOVERNOR CUOMO ACTUALLY TOUCHES UPON SOME OF THE VERY SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS THEY'RE MAKING AT LAGUARDIA AND IT'S PRETTY EXCITING. TAKE A LOOK HERE. FIRST UP, PASSENGERS WILL BE ABLE TO BOARD THEIR PLANE DIRECTLY INSTEAD OF CHASING AFTER IT ON THE TARMAC. THAT'S HELPFUL. THAT'S MORE FUN. NEXT, ALL SECURITY EMPLOYEES WILL NOW WEAR GLOVES AND WILL STOP ASKING IF YOU'RE ON "TINDER." [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT, MOST OF THE PIGEONS WILL BE CLEARED OUT OF THE DELTA SKY LOUNGE. A MAJORITY OF THEM.
Steve: YOU CAN'T GET ALL OF THEM.
Jimmy: NO, WHY WOULD YOU? AFTER THAT, "CHILI'S TOO" WILL BE REPLACED WITH MUCH FANCIER. "CHILIS ALSO."
Steve: AW. OO-LALA. NEXT, "THE LA FAMILIA PIZZA" IN THE UNITED TERMINAL WILL NO LONGER BE MANAGED BY A GIANT RAT WEARING AN APRON. "WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN -- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM OVER HERE?"

Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
OUT OF THE WOMB. OUT OF THE FLESH.
Jimmy: YEAH, I MEAN, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THANK YOU FOR THE SOUND EFFECT. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] GREAT VISUAL THERE. BUT YOU JUST KEPT MODELING, TOO AS YOU GOT OLDER? I HAVE A PICTURE OF YOU MODELING. I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY CUTE, HERE. LOOK AT YOU. YOU GET TO KEEP ALL THE HATS, OR -- THIS IS FROM "MULTIPLE HATS MAGAZINE." AND I REMEMBER THIS. COME ON. HOW CUTE. COME ON.
YOU KNOW, THE BUCKET HAT LOOKED SO HORRENDOUS ON ME, THEY WANTED TO PUT FOUR.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT'S HOW THAT HAPPENED.
Jimmy: SO YOU CONTINUED MODELING AND YOU GOT MORE AND MORE ACTING GIGS, AND NOW YOU'RE DOING "SCREAM" ON MTV. CONGRATULATIONS. IT'S GREAT, BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S NEW AND GREAT. [ APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE BRINGING TO ANOTHER SEASON COMING BACK. DO YOU KNOW YET?
I THINK THERE IS A SEASON TO DO, YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S COMING BACK BECAUSE IT'S A BIG HIT. PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. I KNOW THAT. YOU PLAYED THE CHARACTER, WEIRDLY ENOUGH BASED ON DREW BARRYMORE'S CHARACTER IN "SCREAM."
WHO I LOVE.
Jimmy: WHO WE BOTH LOVE.
SHE'S AMAZING.
Jimmy: I KNOW, I KNOW. I WAS GONNA SPEAK OUT, TOO, BUT I'M TRYING TO MAINTAIN MY COMPOSURE. [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVE DREW SO MUCH. YOU WORKED WITH HER ON "BLENDED," AND I ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER, BUT SHE WAS THE NICEST, RIGHT?
YEAH, I KNOW. SHE WAS AMAZING. I LITERALLY WAS LIKE, "THERE'S NO WAY THAT THIS WOMAN CAN BE SO NICE." AND THEN YOU MEET HER. YOU'RE JUST LIKE, "CAN YOU, JUST, LIKE, BE MEAN FOR ONE MOMENT, BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST SO NICE." BUT SHE'S NOT, SHE'S JUST SO GENUINELY SWEET.
Jimmy: SHE'S BUBBLY AND AWESOME AND SMART AND CREATIVE AND --
WHAT WAS YOUR NICKNAME? SHE GIVES EVERYONE NICKNAMES. I HAVE TO KNOW YOURS, BECAUSE MINE'S --
Jimmy: MINE IS "BIL," BUT IT STANDS FOR "BROTHER-IN-LAW."
OH, OH.
Jimmy: BECAUSE I'M MARRIED TO NANCY JUVONEN, WHO'S HER -- NOW NANCY FALLON. AND THAT'S HER PARTNER IN "FLOWER FILMS."
THAT MAKES SENSE.
Jimmy: BUT THEY'RE FAMILY, SO I'M "BIL," BROTHER-IN-LAW, SO I CALL HER "SIL." [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT WAS YOUR NICKNAME?
"PICKLE."
Jimmy: OKAY. I GET BE CALLED "BIL" AND THEN YOU'RE "PICKLE." DID YOU EAT A LOT OF PICKLES OR SOMETHING?
YOU KNOW, I AM A BIG FAN OF THE PICKLE. I WILL SAY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT I ASKED HER, LIKE, WHY DID SHE GIVE ME THAT NAME? IS MY HEAD REALLY SHAPED LIKE A A PICKLE? LIKE, AM I GREEN?
Jimmy: WHAT? YOUR HEAD'S NOT SHAPED LIKE A A PICKLE.
SO CONFUSED. BUT THEN, SHE SAID THAT I WAS JUST SO CUTE, SHE WANTED TO EAT ME UP. AND THEN, I FIGURED IT HAD TO BE A COMPLIMENT, BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER'S NAME IS "OLIVE." SO SHE JUST LIKES ROUND, GREEN THINGS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YOU KNOW. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. SHE WOULD NEVER CALL ANYONE A A BAD NICKNAME. NO, SHE LOVES YOU. AND SHE ALREADY TOLD ME SHE LOVES YOU OFF CAMERA AS WELL. I GOT TO SAY, PLEASE GIVE MY BEST TO EVERYONE IF YOU STILL TALK TO THE KIDS ON "THE DUFF," BECAUSE I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I REALLY LOVE THEM. AND BEST OF LUCK, AND CONGRATS ON "SCREAM." I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU COME BACK WHEN THE SECOND SEASON'S ON. YOU GUYS CHECK OUT -- ALSO, WAIT. YOU'RE ALSO IN A MOVIE AS WELL.
"BIG SKY."
Jimmy: "BIG SKY." WHEN IS THAT OUT? THAT'S AUGUST 14th IN SELECT CITIES AND ON DEMAND. IT'S A THRILLER AS WELL. SO, IF YOU LIKE "THE DUFF," YOU'LL LAUGH AT IT. YOU WANT TO BE SCARED, THEN GO CHECK OUT --
"SCREAM."
Jimmy: NO. YEAH. THAT'S TRUE, BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- WHEN YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF "SCREAM" AND "DUFF," YOU WAIT UNTIL AUGUST 14th, "BIG SKY." YEAH, YEAH, THAT WAS IT. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
