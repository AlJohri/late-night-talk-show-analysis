YOU'RE AT -- YOU ARE THE SHOW. LISTEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FUN TIME TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT. I SAW DONALD TRUMP'S WIFE, MELANIA, JUST GAVE AN INTERVIEW WHERE SHE SAID THAT THEIR 9-YEAR-OLD SON, BARRON, WANTS TO GROW UP TO BE A GOLFER, A A BUSINESSMAN, AND A PILOT. WHEN MELANIA TOLD HIM IT'S VERY UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN, HE RELIED "DAD'S IN FIRST PLACE FOR PRESIDENT. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, BUT THAT'S -- IT'S AMERICA. THAT'S RIGHT, A NEW REPORT SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP IS STILL LEADING IN THE POLLS AND ONE VOTER WAS QUOTED AS SAYING, "UNFORTUNATELY, I'M LEANING TOWARDS TRUMP." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EVEN WORSE, THAT VOTER WAS JEB BUSH. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. JEB, DON'T SAY SUCH THINGS.
Steve: KEEP THAT TO YOURSELF.
Jimmy: YEAH. TRUMP ACTUALLY HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE THIS WEEK TO TALK ABOUT HIS NEW TAX PLAN, WHICH HE SAYS IS MUCH SIMPLER THAN OTHER TAX PLANS. I WATCHED THE CONFERENCE AND I'M NOT SURE IT'S ALL THAT SIMPLE. I DON'T KNOW.
WE'RE GOING TO CUT THE INDIVIDUAL RATES FROM SEVEN BRACKETS TO FOUR. SO IT COMES BACK DISCOUNTED AT A 10% TAX RATE. WELL, WE'RE LOOKING AT A 3% BUT WE THINK IT COULD BE 5%, IT COULD EVEN BE 6%. 5.4, 5.3, 5.6, EVERY MONTH IS DIFFERENT. 25%, 20%, 10%. THE HIGHEST I'VE HEARD SO FAR IS 42%. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY. PERFECT. I THINK I GOT IT, PROFESSOR. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S GOT TO BE CONFUSING TO HANG OUT WITH TRUMP ON NEW YEAR'S EVE. IT'S LIKE, "10, 9.8, 3.7, 40, 1 BILLION."

THE TORONTO BLUE -- NOTHING SAYS AMERICA'S PASTIME MORE THAN A BUNCH OF GUYS FROM THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC PLAYING FOR A TEAM IN CANADA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT. SPEAKING OF BASEBALL, LAST NIGHT'S ROCKIES-DIAMONDBACKS GAME IN ARIZONA, THE CAMERA SPOTTED A BUNCH OF SORORITY GIRLS TAKING SELFIES ON THEIR PHONES. DURING THE -- LOOK WHAT THE ANNOUNCERS HAD TO SAY.
TWO FOR TWO, A LEAD-OFF SINGLE HERE IN THE FOURTH. AND NOBODY NOTICED. [ LAUGHTER ]

CUSTOMERS WERE LIKE, "THAT'S GREAT -- WAIT, WHAT?" [ LAUGHTER ] DID ANYONE KNOW THAT WAS GOING ON? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? PRISON INMATES ARE MAKING MY FOOD?

THEY PUT A DIFFERENT FISH AND I WAS REALLY CLOSE. OKAY, I'M ACTUALLY, I'M A VEGAN BUT THE REASON I KIND OF STARTED THIS WAS BECAUSE I HAD A FISH THAT WAS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT. WHEN I WOULD COME THROUGH THE DOOR, AND I'M ALSO HIGHLY STONED, BUT I WOULD COME THROUGH THE DOOR AND THIS BLOWFISH WOULD GO TO THE SIDE AND GET EXCITED AND I WOULD, LIKE MY PIG -- MY ANIMALS ARE VERY FOOD ORIENTED SO THE LOVE COMES FROM THE FOOD GIVING. AND I WOULD ALWAYS GO GIVE HIM A SHRIMP AND ALL THAT STUFF. AND HE REALLY KNEW WHO I WAS. HE REALLY GOT EXCITED WHEN I WAS HOME.
Jimmy: CANNIBAL FISH.
AND ONE DAY -- YES. AND ONE DAY I RAN INTO, I WENT TO A SUSHI RESTAURANT WITH A A FEW OF MY FRIENDS AND THEY WERE SERVING BLOWFISH. AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN INTELLIGENT ANIMAL. HAVING A PIG. MY PIG IS EXTREMELY, MORE INTELLIGENT. MY DOGS STILL POOP ON THE FLOOR. AND THEY'RE ALL, LIKE, TEN. I'VE NEVER HAD A PIG ACCIDENT WHICH I'M HAPPY. 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT REALLY TO PICK UP PIG POOP. IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER THAN DOG POOP.
Jimmy: IS THE PIG IN THE HOUSE?
THE PIG IS IN THE HOUSE. THE PIG SLEEPS ON THE COUCH LIKE A BAD BOYFRIEND. YOU KNOW HE JUST, LETS YOU SLEEP ON THE COUCH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND IS IT ONE OF THESE -- IS IT ONE OF THESE PIGS THAT YOU CAN BUY FOR THE HOME? WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR PIGS FROM?
YOU KNOW, I'M FROM NASHVILLE SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AND EVERYONE'S LIKE, SO YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A MINI PIG. AND LIKE, I'M FROM THE SOUTH, WE DON'T BELIEVE IN MINI PIGS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE DON'T CARE. WE GO FULL ON.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A A MINI PIG.
Jimmy: WE GO FULL ON IN NASHVILLE. I DON'T CARE.
PIGS WILL GET AS BIG AS YOU FEED THEM.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I RECENTLY TOOK MY PIG TO THE VET. AND THEY SAID SHE HAD TO GO ON A DIET. AND THEY SAID, WHAT'S SHE EATING? AND I SAID EXACTLY WHAT I EAT. THE VET GOES LIKE THAT TO ME. BUT THE PIG IS ALSO VEGAN. BUT IT LOST, IT NEEDS TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT. BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THE PIG --
Jimmy: IT'S A PIG.
THE PIG DOESN'T REALLY WANT ME TO HOLD IT OR CUDDLE IT. BUT IF I'M HOLDING -- OKAY. SO THE OTHER DAY THE PIG WAS CHASING ME. I WAS SCREAMING. IT WAS BITING THE BACK OF MY ANKLES. THEN I REALIZED I WAS HOLDING A A PEACH. AND I DROPPED THE PEACH AND ALL WAS FINE. IT JUST WANTED THE PEACH, YOU KNOW? SO AS LONG AS YOU GIVE HER FOOD SHE'S TOTALLY COOL. SHE'LL LET YOU PAINT HER NAILS AND ALL THAT. SHE'S AWESOME. [ LAUGHTER ]
