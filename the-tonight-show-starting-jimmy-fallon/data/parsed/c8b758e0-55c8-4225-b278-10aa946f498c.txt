Jimmy: OH MY GOODNESS THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU YOU GUYS. WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW." HOT CROWD. HOT CROWD TONIGHT. YOU GUYS, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE EVERYBODY. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. OH, I LOVE YOU TOO. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WELL, THE BILLBOARD MUSIC AWARDS WERE LAST NIGHT. DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT? [ CHEERS ] THERE WAS A HOLOGRAM OF MICHAEL JACKSON PERFORMING A A NEW SONG AND IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IT WAS REALLY REALISTIC. IT WAS COLORFUL AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE JUST LIKE OBI WAN KENOBI. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, NO IT WAS AN ACTUALL -- IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS THERE. IT WAS SO REALISTIC AT ONE POINT TITO ACTUALLY ASKED HIM FOR MONEY.
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WOW. THAT IS REALISTIC.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT THE MICHAEL JACKSON HOLOGRAM PERFORMED AT THE BILLBOARD MUSIC AWARDS AND THEN HE LEFT TO GO PLAY GOLF WITH HOLOGRAMS OF THE TUPAC AND ELVIS RIGHT AFTER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING. WAIT A SECOND? AND THEN THIS IS KIND OF TOUGH TO WATCH AT THE AWARDS LAST NIGHT. KENDALL JENNER. ONE OF THE KARDASHIANS. I LIKE HER. SHE'S ONE OF THE YOUNGER KARDASHIANS. AND SHE WAS ON STAGE AND SHE HAD TO INTRODUCE THE NEW BAND FIVE SECONDS OF SUMMER. AND IT STARTED OFF OKAY BUT THIS ISN'T WHAT SHE DOES FOR A A LIVING. SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT SHE -- SHE'S PROBABLY TOO YOUNG. DOES SHE GO TO SCHOOL?
Steve: DIDN'T START SCHOOL YET.
Jimmy: HOME SCHOOLING? ANYWAYS WHATEVER IT IS, THIS IS NOT WHAT SHE'S USED TO DOING. SHE WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS AND HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED.
THE BAND ABOUT TO ROCK THE BILLBOARD AWARDS COMES FROM DOWN UNDER BUT THE DIRECTION THEY ARE HEADING IS THE STRAIGHT UP. RECENTLY THEY MADE THEIR DEBUT ON THE BILLBOARD 200 NUMBER TWO. THIS SUMMER -- AND NOW WE WELCOME ONE -- GUYS, I'M THE WORST READER. THEY'RE ONLY GETTING BIGGER. TAKE A LOOK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

[ CHEERS ] BASED ON A TRUE STORY. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK, I THINK I SAW THAT.
Steve: I SAW A DOCUMENTARY.
Jimmy: I WAS EATING POPCORN. I MISSED THE LINE WHERE IT SAID BASED ON A TRUE STORY.
Steve: BASED ON THE TRUE STORY.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK. I WASN'T WATCHING THE SCREEN I WAS INTO MY POPCORN. "GODZILLA" MADE 103 MILLION AT THE BOX OFFICE. THE BIGGEST OPENING OF THE YEAR. AND THIS IS CRAZY BUT, "GODZILLA" DID SO WELL HE ACTUALLY TWEETED ABOUT IT. AND PERSONALLY I KIND OF THINK HE CAME OFF A BIT COCKY. TAKE A LOOK. GODZILLA. "$103 MILLION. WOW, HEY KING KONG, WHERE YOU AT CHUMP? MORE LIKE DING DONG." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: IN HIS DEFENSE, WHAT GUY HASN'T EXPERIENCED PREMATURE CELEBRATION. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? [ LAUGHTER ]

BUT FAIL IN FRONT OF THE EVERYBODY AND MAKE IT HUGE BECAUSE THEN YOU LEARN SOMETHING. AND SO FOR ME, I JUST LEARNED EVERY DAY. I KEPT GOING. I JUST KEPT GOING WITH THE NFL. I KEPT GOING WITH MY ACTING. AND THERE WERE TIMES --
Jimmy: YOU HAD TO MOVE TO OTHER CITIES. YOU HAD TO TELL YOUR WIFE AND KIDS, "SORRY ABOUT THAT. I GOT CUT AGAIN."
SHE -- I PULLER HER RIGHT ALONG WITH EVERY -- ALL THE KIDS, THE WHOLE THING. AND THE THING IS, IS THAT I REALIZED WITH EVERY FAILURE, I GOT A LITTLE BIT HIGHER. AND THAT NO IS NEGOTIABLE. WHEN PEOPLE TELL YOU NO OR REJECT IT IT'S NOT NOW. IT MAY BE FOR NOW BUT TOMORROW IT MAY BE YES. SO I LEARNED TO JUST KEEP GOING AND JUST KEEP FIGHTING FOR WHAT YOU KNOW. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE DOORS STARTED OPENING. AND EVERYTHING JUST STARTED CHANGING FOR ME.
Jimmy: WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE IS LIKE -- I'M JUST CHECKING THE DOORKNOBS.
THAT'S IT. RIGHT. AND ONE THING FIREMAN -- THEY ALWAYS TELL THE GUYS, "DON'T BREAK DOWN THE DOOR. DON'T BREAK DOWN THE DOOR." IF YOU TRY THE DOORKNOB IT'S PROBABLY OPEN. BUT A LOT OF GUYS DON'T DO THAT. THEY'RE LIKE BRAWWHH! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND YET, YOU GET SURPRISED WHEN IT'S OPENED.
THEN I GO, "OH, OH MAN, IT'S OPEN."
Jimmy: OH, IT'S OPEN. SORRY, MY BAD. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S GREAT BOOK. YOU GOTTA CHECK IT OUT. IT COMES OUT TOMORROW. SO EVERYONE PICK THIS THING UP. AND THEN YOU GOT A BUSY WEEKEND BECAUSE, MAN, YOU'RE IN A A ANOTHER ADAM SANDLER MOVIE. AND BOY, OH BOY, DID YOU KNOCK THIS ONE OUT OF THE PARK. JUST AS FUNNY AS THE OTHERS YOU WERE IN.
THANKS, MY MAN.
Jimmy: WHAT WERE YOU IN FOR -- YOU WERE IN "LONGEST YARD?"
"LONGEST YARD." ADAM BASICALLY CALLED ME. I PLAYED CHEESEBURGER EDDY. [ CHEERS ] HE'S LIKE -- AND ADAM, THE WAY ADAM DOES IT, HE CALLS ME UP AND HE'S, "MAN, YOU KNOW, LET'S DO THIS." AND HE'S THAT KIND OF GUY. IF HE LIKES YOUR TALENT AND HE BELIEVES IN YOU, HE JUST PUTS YOU IN. AND NOW YOU GOTTA SHOW HIM PROOF. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND THEN HE PUT ME IN "CLICK." I DID A CAMEO IN "CLICK." THIS ONE --
Jimmy: THIS ONE IS OFF THE CHAINS FOR YOU. YOU ARE LIKE A SOUTH AFRICAN TOM JONES.
TOM JONES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SINGING IN THE WHOLE MOVIE. EVERY TIME THERE IS AN AWKWARD MOMENT OR SOMETHING YOU HAPPEN TO BE THERE WITH THE BAND SINGING. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S CALLED "BLENDED." IT'S A MOVIE WITH DREW BARRYMORE, ADAM SANDLER. HERE IS A CLIP OF TERRY CREWS.
