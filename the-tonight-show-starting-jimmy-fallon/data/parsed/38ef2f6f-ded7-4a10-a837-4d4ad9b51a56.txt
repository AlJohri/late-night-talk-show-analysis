HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE TRYING TO GET ATTENTION. BERNIE SANDERS WHO IS CHALLENGING HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION JUST HOSTED HIS OWN AMA ON REDDIT. YOU KNOW WHAT AN AMA IS? IT STANDS FOR ASK ME ANYTHING. PEOPLE LOG ON AND ASK QUESTIONS. WELL, HE ENDED UP GETTING TONS OF QUESTIONS. IT WAS VERY, VERY POPULAR. BUT, HERE ARE SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR ONES. TAKE A LOOK.

IT'S A REALLY GOOD SHOW. I'LL JUST TELL YOU ABOUT IT QUICKLY. I PLAY A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE IN '67 IN L.A., AND THE WOMAN THAT I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH IS MARRIED TO A LAWYER WHO IS RUNNING THE REAGAN FOR GOVERNOR ELECTION. THEIR DAUGHTER, THIS 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL HAS GONE MISSING OR RUN AWAY. THIS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT THEY DON'T WANT IN THE PAPER. SHE ASKS ME, "CAN YOU FIND HER, LIKE OFF THE BOOKS? CAUSE WE DON'T WANT IT IN THE PAPERS." I SAY SURE, 'CAUSE I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH HER. I TRACK HER DOWN TO THE DESERT WHERE SHE'S LIVING OUTSIDE OF L.A ON A LITTLE HIPPIE COMMUNE RUN BY A GUY NAMED CHARLIE MANSON.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHERE TO TAKE IT.
THIS IS 1967, THIS IS TWO YEARS BEFORE THE FAMOUS TATE-LaBIANCA MURDERS. AND THAT'S LIKE THE INTRO INTO OUR WORLD AND OUR SHOW.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT. WE HAVE A CLIP. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT DAVID DUCHOVNY IN "AQUARIUS" LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
WATCH GUYS LIKE YOU JUST DRY UP AND BLOW AWAY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
FIRST, YOU TWO WALK BACK WHATEVER YOU SAID ABOUT ME TO WHOEVER YOU SAID IT TO. NEXT, THE GUY ABOVE YOU, THE GUY ABOVE HIM, AND THE GUY ABOVE THAT.
I WANT A DEAL IN WRITING.
YOU WANT A DEAL?
YEAH.

Jimmy: I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: I'M A BIG FAN. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW" MANY TIMES. BUT ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JOHNNY CARSON" IS A DIFFERENT STORY. LOOK, HERE'S YOU DOING STAND UP.
YEAH, THAT'S --
Jimmy: WITH JOHNNY CARSON.
SEE, PEOPLE OF THIS GENERATION WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND. BUT FOR A COMIC BACK THEN THAT WAS MT. EVEREST. IF JOHNNY LIKED YOU.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, AND SO WHAT YOU WOULD DO, AND THEY WOULD TELL YOU BEFORE, YOU DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE COMING TO THE CHAIR. CAUSE YOU WOULD PERFORM. AND THEY SAID IF JOHNNY DOESN'T LIKE YOU HE'LL CLAP, AND IF HE LIKES YOU HE'LL GIVE YOU, YOU KNOW, A GOOD JOB.
Jimmy: NO GOOD.
AND IF HE LOVES YOU HE WILL WAVE YOU OVER TO THE CHAIR. SO YOU GET TO THE END OF THE SIX MINUTES, YOU'VE BEEN DOING 500 SHOWS A YEAR, YOU KNOW. AND YOU'RE SCARED TO LOOK BECAUSE IT'S LIKE CAESAR, YOU KNOW, DOES HE LIVE OR DOES HE DIE? [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO, YEAH --
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T TALK TO HIM BEFORE THE SHOW.
NO, YOU NEVER MET, YOU WALK THROUGH THE CURTAIN AND LOOKED AND WENT, OH MY GOD THERE'S JOHNNY. YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO AS YOU'RE -- AND AS YOU'RE DOING, YOU THINK HE'S KIND OF BEHIND YOU SO YOU CAN HEAR HIM LAUGH. AND LIKE, OKAY, I GUESS I'M DOING OKAY.
Jimmy: WOW. AND YOU TURNED OUT, BOY YOU DEFINITELY DID OKAY. OH MY GOD.
I MADE HIM LAUGH.
Jimmy: THAT WAS THE BEST. TO MAKE JOHNNY CARSON LAUGH, THAT WAS THE THING THAT ANY COMEDIAN WOULD WATCH AND GO, OH WOW.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT MUST BE GOOD IF YOU MADE JOHNNY LAUGH. WERE YOU DOING THE REDNECK JOKES HERE?
NOT LONG. ABOUT, RIGHT AROUND THAT TIME I STARTED. I WROTE THE FIRST ONE IN '87. I THINK. I'VE DONE THE PATRIOTS DAY CALENDAR SINCE '90. SO 25 YEARS.
Jimmy: OH MY GOD.
AND EVERY YEAR I'M LIKE, THERE CAN'T BE 365 MORE OF THESE?
Jimmy: BUT DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN YOU WERE DOING IT YOU'D GO, HEY THIS IS TO BE A A SUPER FAMOUS THING.
OH GOSH, NO. I'M NOT THAT SMART. I HAD NO IDEA. I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT BEING A A HOOK. IT WAS FUNNY, CAUSE LIKE, WHEN I FIRST STARTED IN COMEDY I WOULD COME UP TO NEW YORK AND PLAY LIKE, CATCH A RISING STAR AND DANGERFIELD'S AND ALL THE NEW YORK GUYS WERE LIKE, "HEY JEFF I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS. YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE VOICE LESSONS TO LOOSE THAT STUPID ACCENT YOU GOT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH IT'S SO STUPID THE WAY YOU TALK. YOU TALK REAL STUPID. [ LAUGHTER ]
I DID HAVE TO LEARN TO TALK LIKE THAT SO EVERY CAB RIDE DIDN'T COST A HUNDRED BUCKS. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE IF YOU GET IN THE CAB AND GO, [ SOUTHERN DRAWL ] "CAN YOU TAKE ME TO TIMES SQUARE?" OH, YEAH, WE GO TO TIMES SQUARE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE TO GO OVER BRIDGE FIRST. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I ALWAYS WORE JEANS AND BOOTS SO THEY WOULD KID -- AND DROVE A TRUCK AND SO THEY WOULD GO. "FOXWORTHY, YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A REDNECK FROM GEORGIA." AND SO I'M PLAYING IN THIS CLUB IN DETROIT AND AFTER THE SHOW THEY'RE KIDDING ME ABOUT BEING A REDNECK AND THE CLUB IS ATTACHED TO A BOWLING ALLEY THAT HAS A VALET PARKING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE. IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T HAVE REDNECKS LOOK OUT THE WINDOW. PEOPLE ARE VALET PARKING AT THE BOWLING ALLEY.
Jimmy: IT'S A GIFT FROM GOD.
I WENT BACK TO THE HOTEL AND WROTE TEN JOKES, YOU KNOW, NEVER THINKING IT WAS THE HOOK AND I WENT BACK THE NEXT NIGHT AND PEOPLE STARTED LAUGHING AND POINTING AT EACH OTHER.
Jimmy: AND YOUR WIFE FOUND THE ORIGINAL JOKES YOU WROTE A --
YEAH, SEVERAL YEARS AGO. SHE FOUND IT LIKE THE WADDED UP PIECE OF YELLOW PAPER AND SHE FRAMED IT. IT'S LIKE NEXT TO THE DOOR OF OUR HOUSE.
Jimmy: LOOK AT THIS.
AND THAT'S IN OUR HOUSE, AND I'M LIKE, "IT'S SO UGLY." SHE SAID, "IT PAID FOR THE HOUSE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THEY'RE GREAT JOKES.
WELL THEY'RE ONE-LINERS. WE LIVE IN A NATION WHERE NOBODY DOES ONE-LINERS. SO THEY'RE SO, YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: RODNEY DANGERFIELD --
YEAH.
Jimmy: THE GREATEST. BUT I WAS READING SOME OF THESE AND THIS IS JUST --
THEY'RE SO STUPID.
Jimmy: NO THEY'RE SO FUN. "IF YOUR MOTHER KEEPS A SPIT CAN ON THE IRONING BOARD."
FIRST ONE I EVER WROTE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I LOVE IT SO MUCH. "IF YOUR DOG HAS A LITTLER OF PUPPIES IN THE LIVING ROOM AND NOBODY NOTICES." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS ONE I JUST LOVE. "IF YOU HAVE NOT TRUSTED THE ACADEMY AWARDS EVER SINCE JERRY REID WAS SNUBBED FOR 'SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT.'" [ LAUGHTER ]
HE WAS SNUBBED.
Jimmy: HE REALLY WAS. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, THE REBOOTING OF "ARE YOU SMARTER THAN A FIFTH GRADER."
YEAH.
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY THAT THEY'RE REBOOTING IT. THIS IS GREAT. 'CAUSE I LOVED IT.
WELL PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO ME AND THEY WOULD GO, "THEY NEED TO BRING 'FIFTH GRADER' BACK." AND YOU'RE SMILING, BUT YOU'RE LIKE, "IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. ONCE IT'S GONE, IT'S GONE."
Jimmy: ONCE A SHOW GETS CANCELLED IT DOESN'T COME BACK.
YEAH. WE DID THREE OR FOUR SEASONS. AND SO AT THE END OF THE YEAR FOX CALLED AND SAID, "HEY IF WE BROUGHT THIS BACK WOULD YOU WANT TO HOST IT AGAIN?" AND I'M LIKE, "YEAH, THAT'S MY BABY." YOU KNOW IT ENDED UP BEING IN LIKE 59 COUNTRIES.
Jimmy: REALLY?
SO YEAH.
Jimmy: I LOVE WATCHING. I LOVE PLAYING. CLEARLY I DON'T KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS.
CLEARLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CLEARLY WOULD BE AN ADVERB. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY.
