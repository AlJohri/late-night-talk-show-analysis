Jimmy: KEEP HIM A LITTLE BABY FOREVER.
SO, HONEY, I THOUGHT OF YOU, I SAID "TWO."
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU DO SAY THAT. WHEN'S HIS BIRTHDAY?
HIS BIRTHDAY IS IN NOVEMBER.
Jimmy: NOVEMBER, OKAY, SO HE IS ALMOST THREE, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
BUT YOU GOT TO SAY TWO!
Jimmy: NO, HE IS TWO.
NO ANGER!
Jimmy: SORRY, HONEY, YEAH, I'M SORRY!
HE'S TWO!
Jimmy: HE'S STILL TWO.
HE'S STILL TWO!
Jimmy: FOREVER TWO, YEAH. I SAW YOU AT THE EMMYS VERY QUICKLY. BUT YOU WERE UP PRESENTING, AND I JUST GAVE YOU A QUICK WAVE. BUT YOU LOOKED OVER AT ME. VERY QUICKLY.
WAS THAT YOU? I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS YOU OR NOT?
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT WAS ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
SO MANY PEOPLE.
Jimmy: I HAD A BUNCH OF RUBBER BANDS ON MY HEAD.
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YEAH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jimmy: I WAS THERE FOR LIKE AN HOUR DOING THAT SO IT WAS FUN.
YEAH, PEOPLE WERE -- THE SHOW WAS LONG OVER.
Jimmy: OH, NO, YEAH.
AND SOMEONE JUST SMASHED YOU ON THE GROUND. THEY JUST GOT FRUSTRATED.
Jimmy: YOU SAW THAT, YEAH.
AND THREW YOU ON THE FLOOR!
Jimmy: JUST LANDED ON THE GROUND. YEAH, EXACTLY.
IT WAS AWFUL.
Jimmy: BUT THAT WAS NOT YOUR FIRST TIME AT THE EMMYS. YOU, IN FACT, ARE THE -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, THE YOUNGEST ACTOR TO BE NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY.
THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE. I WENT -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: LOOK AT THAT GUY.
I WAS PROBABLY 13 YEARS OLD THERE.
WE LOVE YOU, KEVIN ARNOLD!
OH, RIGHT! YES! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THEY LOVE YOU, KEVIN!
I LOVE YOU GUYS. I LOVE YOU GUYS.
Jimmy: IT'S GOT TO FEEL GOOD, RIGHT?
IT'S GREAT, IT'S GREAT! PEOPLE SAY DO YOU MIND TALKING ABOUT IT? PEOPLE REMEMBER IT SO FONDLY AND ARE SO NICE ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT SO MUCH.
IT'S GREAT, IT'S GREAT.
Jimmy: I'M HAPPY YOU'RE BACK, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE A A DIRECTOR AS WELL AND I GO, WELL, "NOW, MAYBE YOU WON'T BE IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA ANYMORE."
WELL, THAT WASN'T THE PLAN. YOU KNOW, SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID, IN THAT RENTED TUX, I WANTED TO BE A DIRECTOR. AND SO OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS OR MORE, I HAVE JUST BEEN KIND OF COMMITTED TO BEING BEHIND THE CAMERAS AND BUILT UP THIS CAREER, AND ACTING WAS NOT IN THE CARDS AT ALL FOR ME. IT WAS NOT PART OF THE PLAN.
Jimmy: SO HOW DO YOU HOOK UP WITH ROB LOWE AND DO "THE GRINDER"?
SO MY -- NICK STOLLER IS ONE OF THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS ON THE SHOW. GREAT INCREDIBLE WRITER AND DIRECTOR. AND HIS DAUGHTER IS IN CLASS WITH MY DAUGHTER AT SCHOOL.
Jimmy: UH HUH.
AND SO HE'S LIKE, "HEY, GO LOOK AT THIS SCRIPT." AND I WAS, "OH, THAT'S FANTASTIC. I WOULD LOVE TO DIRECT IT, IT SOUNDS GREAT!" HE GOES, "OH, NO, NO, IT'S FOR YOU TO ACT IN." I WAS LIKE, "OH, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S REALLY FOR ME." AND THEN I WAS LIKE, "AH, THIS IS GOING TO BE AWKWARD BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE IN SCHOOL TOGETHER FOR LIKE TEN YEARS." AND I'M LIKE, "OH, NICK, JUST TELL ME -- LIKE, I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT SO WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO SAY 'NO' THAT WILL MAKE IT LESS UNCOMFORTABLE?" AND I FEEL LIKE, MOST OF THE DECISIONS IN MY ADULT LIFE HAVE BEEN BASED ON WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE OUR NEXT ENCOUNTER LESS UNCOMFORTABLE.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.
AND IT'S SERVED ME WELL, YOU KNOW? AND HE'S LIKE, "WELL AT LEAST COME EVERYBODY!" "AT LEAST DO THAT." AND I MET EVERYBODY AND THERE WERE -- JAKE KASDAN DIRECTED IT. AND I MET THE WRITERS AND ROB LOWE WAS ATTACHED. AND I JUST COULDN'T SAY NO. IT WAS A GREAT TEAM AND A GREAT SCRIPT. AND I JUST JUMPED IN AND WAS EXCITED ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: PEOPLE WILL LOVE YOU. THE REVIEWS ARE GREAT AND I LOVE THAT YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT, BUT YOU LEGITIMATELY ARE EXCITED ABOUT IT. I SAW THIS ON INSTAGRAM, OKAY.
OKAY. SO RIGHT.
Jimmy: A POSTER FROM YOUR SHOW, "THE GRINDER" GOING UP. THAT'S YOU.
SO THIS IS IN FRONT OF FOX STUDIOS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I HAVE DRIVEN BY FOX STUDIOS SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID. AND THERE'S ALL THESE LITTLE POSTERS AND THERE'S ONE BIG POSTER. RIGHT, THOUGH THAT'S HARD, WHAT DID I DO THAT? THERE'S ONE BIG POSTER HERE COMING IN FROM THE EAST.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU'RE LIKE A A WEATHERMAN NOW.
THIS IS NOT EASY. SO THERE'S A LITTLE POSTER THERE. AND THEN LATER IN THE WEEKEND, IT'S GOING TO COME UP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY, WE GET IT, WE UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU, HURRICANE. HURRICANE SAVAGE, EVERYBODY.
SO I TOOK THIS PICTURE. AND I'M LIKE "MY GOD, IT'S LIKE, THIS BIG THING AND IT'S SO COOL. HOW LONG IS IT GONNA -- IT MIGHT NOT BE UP FOR VERY LONG." AND I WAS DRIVING INTO WORK, AND IT WAS RIGHT AT THE FRONT GATE OF FOX. SO, EVERYONE IS DRIVING BY. AND I RIDE MY BIKE TO WORK, YOU KNOW, TO GET A LITTLE EXERCISE.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S NICE.
BUT I'M LIKE, SERIOUS, LIKE WITH THE HELMET, AND THE SHORTS, AND THE WHOLE THING, RIGHT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, "DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. NO ONE'S GOING TO SEE ME THERE."
Jimmy: YOU'RE THAT GUY?
YEAH, OH, TOTALLY. SO I TAKE THIS PICTURE. AND LIKE MINUTES LATER, I GET A A COMMENT FROM SARAH PAULSON.
Jimmy: WHICH YOU POSTED ON INSTAGRAM.
I POSTED ON INSTAGRAM.
Jimmy: AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I WAS JUST LIKE, "OH, SO EXCITED, SEPTEMBER 29TH HERE COMES --" YOU KNOW, "GETTING READY FOR 'THE GRINDER'." SO, SARAH PAULSON, WHO IS THIS ACTRESS WHO I JUST LOVE.
Jimmy: I LOVE HER.
I LOVE "DEADWOOD" AND "AMERICAN HORROR STORY."
Jimmy: YEAH.
SHE'S LIKE, "HEY MAN, I SAW YOU TAKING A PICTURE OF YOUR OWN POSTER OUT IN FRONT OF THE STUDIO -- [ LAUGHTER ] NICE BIKING OUTFIT." I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ON INSTAGRAM?
OH YEAH, IT WAS HUMILIATING. AND I WAS LIKE "YOU KNOW, SAVAGE, YOU'VE GOT TO ACT LIKE YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE, MAN." LIKE JUST, WHO DOES THAT IN FRONT OF THE STUDIO? I SHOULD HAVE SENT SOMEBODY. I GOT EXCITED. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: WHAT A DORK!
WHAT A DORK!
Jimmy: WHAT A DORK!
BUT I HAD THIS GREAT PHOTO. AND -- BUT I WANT TO BE THE GUY WHO JUST TOSSES THE FOOTBALL TO THE REF AFTER HE SCORES A A TOUCHDOWN. I'M LIKE, SCORE A TOUCHDOWN. WHEE!
Jimmy: NO, IT'S GOOD.
SOMEONE TAKE A PICTURE!
Jimmy: NO, I'M GLAD YOU'RE EXCITED. YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF IT.
I'M SO EXCITED! ON FOX! IT'S A BIG DEAL.
Jimmy: IT IS A BIG DEAL AND IT'S GETTING CRAZY GOOD REVIEWS. AND I SHOULD REMIND EVERYBODY, "THE GRINDER" IS THE IDEA. AND YOU'RE -- WHAT IS IT? YOU'RE A LAWYER, YOUR DAD IS A A LAWYER.
YEAH, AND I PLAY BROTHERS -- ROB LOWE AND I ARE BROTHERS.
Jimmy: YEP.
WHICH I FEEL LIKE HAS BEEN A A LONG TIME COMING. I FEEL LIKE FOR MOST OF MY LIFE, PEOPLE ARE LIKE, ARE YOU ROB LOWE? AND TROY WAS LIKE --
Jimmy: ME, TOO. ME TOO, YEAH.
YEAH, FOR YEARS I WOULD SIGN HIS NAME. I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT ANYONE'S FEELINGS. YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE, YOU LIKE TWINS. IN FACT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW RIGHT NOW IF I'M TALKING TO YOU OR --
WHICH ONE? YOU DON'T KNOW, RIGHT?
Jimmy: HI, ROB.
SO I FEEL LIKE SHOW BUSINESS HAS REALLY JUST CAUGHT UP TO WHAT AMERICA HAS BEEN THINKING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OF COURSE, YEAH.
ALL ALONG.
Jimmy: SO NOW HE'S A LAWYER, SO YOU'RE ALL LAWYERS TOGETHER.
SO WE'RE LAWYERS. HE PLAYED A LAWYER ON TELEVISION. HIS SHOW JUST ENDED SO HE COMES BACK TO BOISE AND SAYS, "OH I WAS A LAWYER ON TELEVISION. I CAN BE A LAWYER IN REAL LIFE." AND EVERYONE THINK THIS IS A A GREAT IDEA EXCEPT FOR ME.
Jimmy: YEAH, NO, AND "THE GRINDER" -- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE APP? [ LAUGHTER ]
UH -- NO, NO. AND I DID ASK THAT BEFORE I GOT INVOLVED.
Jimmy: OKAY, YEAH. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR FAMILY FRIENDLY HAPPY GOOD TIMES --
YOU GO TO GRINDER WITH AN "E." GRINDER WITH AN "E."
