YOU GUYS LOOK GOOD TONIGHT. WELCOME. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ARE STARTING TO REALLY GO AT IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE GOING NUTS. YEAH, YEAH. THIS WEEK, HILLARY CRITICIZED DONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR SAYING THAT WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT, THE REST OF THE WORLD IS WATCHING. [ LAUGHTER ] WHILE THE REST OF THE WORLD IS LIKE, "YEAH, AND WE'RE LOVING THIS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. YOU CAN'T WRITE THIS. CANADA, PASS THE POPCORN." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS ELECTION KEEPS CHANGING. IN FACT, ONE OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS JUST SAID TRUMP MAY NOT ACTUALLY BUILD A REAL WALL. HE SAID IT MIGHT BE JUST A A METAPHOR FOR TIGHTER IMMIGRATION LAWS. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] OF COURSE, TRUMP SAID HE DOESN'T WASTE TIME WITH METAPHORS. THEN REMINDED EVERYONE THAT HIS HANDS ARE VERY, VERY BIG. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Steve: TRUMP.
Jimmy: AND GET THIS, WHILE AT A RALLY WITH CHRIS CHRISTIE IN NEW JERSEY YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP SAID, QUOTE, "IF YOU CAN MAKE IT IN NEW JERSEY, YOU CAN DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING YOU WANT IN LIFE."

MEANWHILE, I SAW THAT CHRIS CUOMO INTERVIEWED HILLARY CLINTON ON CNN YESTERDAY. AND I'M NOT SURE HOW WELL IT WENT. TAKE A LOOK.

I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. GOOD TRY THOUGH, CHRIS. I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THAT AND YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO BE RESPONDING.

Jimmy: THAT'S MY NEW FAVORITE --
Steve: GREAT JOB.
Jimmy: THAT'S MY NEW FAVORITE CHARACTER. I LIKE THAT GUY. "OH, YEAH, REALLY, GREAT JOB. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT." ONE THING I NOTICED IN THESE INTERVIEWS IS THAT HILLARY SEEMS TO BE TIRED OF PEOPLE REFERRING TO HER AS THE POSSIBLE NOMINEE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND SEE IF YOU AGREE.
SO YOU GET INTO THE GENERAL ELECTION, IF YOU'RE THE NOMINEE FOR YOUR PARTY.
I WILL BE THE NOMINEE FOR MY PARTY, CHRIS. THAT IS -- THAT IS ALREADY DONE IN EFFECT. THERE IS NO WAY THAT I WON'T BE. [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
