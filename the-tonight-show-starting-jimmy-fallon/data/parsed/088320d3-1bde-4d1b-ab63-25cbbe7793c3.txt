WHAT?
Jimmy: DID YOU KNOW THAT? RATINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN HIGHER IF IT WEREN'T FOR ALL THE PEOPLE COVERING THEIR EYES.
Steve: HEY! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NAILED IT. NAILED IT. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, DID YOU KNOW THIS, THOUGH? BEFORE EVERY DEBATE, THE CANDIDATES GO ON STAGE, AND THEY DO A SOUND CHECK.

Jimmy: OF COURSE, ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP LAST NIGHT WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL WEALTH. BUT, TRUMP DEFENDED HIMSELF SAYING THAT HE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT HOW RICH HE IS JUST TO BE QUOTE, "BRAGGADOCIOUS." [ LAUGHTER ] AND, HE INTRODUCED HIS SPEECHWRITER, THE NINJA TURTLES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I'M TOTALLY BRAGGADOCIOUS, DUDE!" ACTUALLY, DURING LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE, TRUMP WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT OUR OUTDATED MILITARY AND SAID THAT OUR B-52s ARE SO OLD, THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER COULD BE FLYING THEM. BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS NOTHING GETS A DEBATE CROWD GOING LIKE SOME OLD "YOUR B-52s ARE SO OLD" JOKE. [ LAUGHTER ] "YOUR B-52s ARE SO OLD THEY NEED CIALIS TO LAUNCH A A MISSILE."
