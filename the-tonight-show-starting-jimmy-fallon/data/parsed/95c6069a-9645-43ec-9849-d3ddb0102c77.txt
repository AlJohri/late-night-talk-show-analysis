Questlove: 388!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HI. OH, HI. HEY! HELLO, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON, AND LET ME BE THE FIRST TO SAY WHAT MONTH IS IT? IS IT JUNE? WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE OUTSIDE? THEY'RE SAYING THAT THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE WARMEST CHRISTMASES IN 30 YEARS, WITH TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO STAY IN THE 60s AND 70s THROUGHOUT THE HOLIDAYS. YEAH. OF COURSE, WITHOUT THE SNOW AND COLD WEATHER, A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE EAST COAST ARE NOW BEING FORCED TO CHANGE SOME OF THEIR USUAL HOLIDAY TRADITIONS. LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, LAST CHRISTMAS, PEOPLE LEFT OUT MILK AND COOKIES FOR SANTA. THIS CHRISTMAS, PEOPLE LEAVE OUT A COOL RAG AND A STICK OF MITCHUM DEODORANT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: OOH.
Jimmy: MITCHUM'S THE --
Steve: MITCHUM.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE GOOD STUFF.
Steve: THAT'S WHAT SANTA WEARS.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS AROUND.
Steve: YEAH, HE DOES NOT LIKE --
Jimmy: YOU GET MITCHUM, YEAH. LAST CHRISTMAS, SANTA MADE A A LIST OF WHO'S NAUGHTY OR NICE. THIS CHRISTMAS, SANTA MADE A A LIST OF WHO HAS CENTRAL AIR AND WHO DOESN'T. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT WORKS. IT WORKS. FINALLY, LAST CHRISTMAS, YOU WENT TO AN UGLY SWEATER PARTY. THIS CHRISTMAS, YOU'RE GOING TO AN UGLY, SWEATY PARTY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE? [ APPLAUSE ] EITHER WAY, IT SHOULD BE A FUN HOLIDAY SEASON. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, IT'S THE ELECTION. I SAW THAT A NEW POLL FOUND THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS NOW INCREASING HER LEAD OVER BERNIE SANDERS. EXPERTS SAY BERNIE WOULD NEED SOMETHING MAJOR TO REGAIN PEOPLE'S ATTENTION. THEN BERNIE WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, LEAK THE SEX TAPE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DO IT. JUST THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: FEEL THE BERN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? AHEAD OF TONIGHT'S REPUBLICAN DEBATE OVER ON CNN, DONALD TRUMP'S DOCTOR RELEASED HIS MEDICAL RECORDS. AND GET THIS. HE SAID THAT TRUMP HAS NEVER USED ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO IN HIS LIFE. WHICH EXPLAINS HOW TRUMP GOT SO GOOD AT RUINING A PARTY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "NO, THANK YOU. NO." SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY'S GOING AFTER TRUMP. IN FACT, A SAUDI PRINCE CRITICIZED TRUMP ON TWITTER, AND TRUMP RESPONDED BY SAYING THAT THE PRINCE IS TRYING TO CONTROL U.S. POLITICS "WITH DADDY'S MONEY." [ LAUGHTER ] UNLIKE TRUMP, WHO STARTED OUT SCRAPING BY LIKE THIS.
MY FATHER GAVE ME A SMALL LOAN OF A MILLION DOLLARS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "KIND OF LENT ME SOME MONEY. NO BIG DEAL. HE FLIPPED ME A MILLION DOLLARS. WHATEVER. HE SAID, 'DON'T WORRY ABOUT PAYING ME BACK. I DON'T CARE.'" MEANWHILE, NEWT GINGRICH SPOKE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S LEAD IN THE POLLS AND CALLED TRUMP THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN KICK DOWN THE DOORS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. YEAH. AND HE CALLED CHRIS CHRISTIE THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN BURST THROUGH THE WALL LIKE THE KOOL-AID MAN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OH, YEAH! OH, YEAH! I SAW THAT -- I SAW THAT "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" NAMED SERENA WILLIAMS ITS 2015 SPORTSPERSON OF THE YEAR. THAT'S PRETTY NICE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHE'S AMAZING. SERENA WILLIAMS. WHEN I HEARD THAT, I WAS LIKE, "WHAT'S A SPORTSPERSON? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CAN'T THEY JUST SAY ATHLETE OF THE YEAR?" SPORTSPERSON SOUNDS LIKE A NERD TRYING TO DESCRIBE A FOOTBALL TEAM. "I SEE THE SQUAD OF THE SPORTSPERSONS HAS ENTERED THE CAFETERIA. IT'S TIME FOR ME TO LEAVE." THIS IS COOL. THE FIRST TRAILER FOR "STAR TREK: BEYOND" -- "STAR TREK: BEYOND", WAS RELEASED TODAY. AND SOME FANS ARE ACTUALLY CRITICIZING IT FOR BEING TOO ACTION-PACKED. BECAUSE IF YOU LIKE "STAR TREK", YOU LIKE YOUR ACTION SLOW AND WEIRD. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: FINALLY, THIS IS GOING VIRAL. A MAN WHO WORKS AT A GYM IN ARIZONA WAS TOLD THAT A URINAL IN THE MEN'S ROOM WAS BROKEN. SO, HE WALKS IN JUST TO CHECK IT OUT. LOOK AT WHAT HE SAW WHEN HE WALKED IN THE BATHROOM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, THE GUY IN ONE OF THE STALLS IS LIKE, "WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE, YOU GUYS? ARE YOU OKAY, MAN?" WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪

Steve: THAT WAS THE PRIZE?
Jimmy: IT WAS ME, BILL BURR, AND PATRICE O'NEAL GOT THE SAME MANAGER. AND WE WON A MANAGER. YEAH, SO IT WAS LIKE, "WAIT, ARE WE COOL WITH THIS?" IT WAS LIKE, ODD, BUT ANYWAY, IT'S JUST GREAT TO SEE. HE'S LIKE THE BIGGEST COMEDIAN NOW IN THE WORLD AND HE'S ALL OVER NETFLIX. HE'S SO FUNNY.
Steve: COME ON.

SO WE HAD THIS FUN IDEA, AND IT INVOLVED THE ROOTS AND THE MUSIC FOR "STAR WARS." SO WE CALLED UP LEGENDARY COMPOSER JOHN WILLIAMS AND WE ASKED HIM IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING SPECIAL WITH IT. NORMALLY, HE SAYS, "NO." SO HE DIDN'T RETURN OUR CALL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT SOMEONE FROM HIS CAMP DID. AND THEY SAID, "YEAH, SURE. SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA."

Jimmy: DO YOU KNOW MARK AT ALL? DID YOU GET TO -- DID YOU GUYS -- FROM THE BOSTON SCENE AT ALL?
NO, I ONLY MET HIM THROUGH DOING THE MOVIE. I GOT TO MEET HIM BRIEFLY. BUT WHAT'S FUNNY IS LIVING ON THE WEST COAST NOW, IF YOU JUST -- I ALWAYS SAY I'M FROM BOSTON. BECAUSE IF I SAY I'M FROM CANTON, PEOPLE GO, "OHIO?" THEN I GOT TO GO, "NO, MASSACHUSETTS." AND JUST THAT LITTLE EXTRA THING LIKE, SLOWLY KILLS ME THAT I HAVE TO HAVE THAT BACK AND FORTH.
Jimmy: THAT DRIVES YOU CRAZY?
YEAH. SO I JUST SAY I'M FROM BOSTON.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A TROUBLED, TROUBLED HUMAN BEING.
YEAH. I'M A LOANER, MAN. I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S NOT LYING.
I DON'T. I DON'T.
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW.
THIS FIFTH AVENUE DURING CHRISTMAS TIME, THE THOUGHTS THAT GO THROUGH MY HEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] THE THOUGHTS THAT GO THROUGH MY HEAD. I JUST WANT TO CHOP THAT TREE DOWN AND WATCH IT LAND ON PEOPLE AS I WALK OVER THEIR HEADS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO! IT'S THE HOLIDAY SEASON.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: NO. YOU KNEW I WASN'T GOING TO STICK TO THAT.
Jimmy: I KNOW.
I WAS TRYING TO BE HAPPY. I WAS TRYING TO BE HAPPY. I WAS TRYING. WE TRIED.
Jimmy: WE TRIED.
OH, YOU PLAY DRUMS. THAT WAS FUN, WASN'T IT?
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT WENT RIGHT IN THE TANK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
RIGHT IN THE TANK. I GOT TO TRASH PEOPLE OR IT DOESN'T WORK.
Jimmy: DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO YOU.
YOU KNOW WHO I FEEL BAD FOR RIGHT NOW? McDONALD'S. I FEEL BAD FOR THEM.
Jimmy: WHY WOULD YOU --
BECAUSE THEY BACK PEDALED. THEY ALLOWED FAT PEOPLE TO BLAME THEM, AND IT'S JUST OVER. THE SECOND THEY MADE THE SALAD, IT WAS OVER. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS OVER. THEY SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S OUR FAULT. IT'S OUR FAULT. IT'S OUR FAULT YOU'RE FAT." IT ISN'T. EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S FATTENING. YOU DON'T ORDER 50 SANDWICHES, RIGHT? BUT THEY'RE A BUSINESS. IF YOU ORDER IT, THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU. THAT'S NOT THEIR FAULT.
Jimmy: AND YOU THINK THAT THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. ONCE THEY INVENTED THE SALAD, THEY -- THEY ADMIT IT.
IT'S FOR KIDS AND FOR WHEN YOU GET HAMMERED. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. YOU GO IN THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GET THE BREAD IN YOU. THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR. THANK YOU.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR.
Jimmy: BILL, HOW DID YOU --
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO GET A A SALAD AT McDONALD'S. YOU WANT TO EAT HEALTHY TONIGHT, JIMMY?
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH? GO TO McDONALD'S. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE ANYMORE. IT'S SAD. THEY LOST THEIR IDENTITY.
Jimmy: YOU FEEL SAD.
I DID.
Jimmy: YEAH, WELL, HOPEFULLY --
IT'S LIKE WATCHING A A COMEDIAN APOLOGIZE TO A A BLOGGER. IT'S LIKE, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? IT'S ONE PERSON IN THE CROWD WHO SAT UP LATE NIGHT WITH THEIR FEELINGS HURT, RIGHT?
Jimmy: YEAH.
SOME MELTED BUTTERFINGERS ON THEIR CHEST, SITTING THERE TYPING AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EATING BUTTERFINGERS.
THEY ACT LIKE THEY WON A A PEABODY AWARD AND THEY WRITE FOR THE "TIMES." IT'S LIKE THIS ONE GUY IN THE CROWD.
Jimmy: NO, YOU CAN'T CATER TO THOSE GUYS.
YOU CAN'T.
Jimmy: NO. YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T VEER FROM WHAT YOU DO. LOOK AT AC/DC. YOU KNOW? THEY MADE THE SAME SONG. THEY SING ABOUT THEIR BALLS, THE DEVIL AND WOMEN. THAT'S IT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY NEVER VEERED FROM THAT. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT, LIKE, JEFFERSON AIRPLANE. THEY'RE LIKE, "OOH, IT'S THE '80s." THEN THEY BECAME JEFFERSON STARSHIP AND THEN STARSHIP. AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS."
Jimmy: YEAH. NO, YOU GOT TO STICK TO WHAT YOU KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? YOU'RE SINGING AT McDONALD'S. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO SEGUE WAY INTO YOUR NETFLIX SERIES, BUT I TRIED.
I'M SORRY. I KNOW. I KNEW THE SECOND I SAW THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, I WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING TO BOMB." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO BOMB.
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT BOMBING.
THIS IS NOT MY VIBE.
Jimmy: NO, THIS IS FESTIVE. THIS IS IT. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DO THIS.
IT'S NOT FESTIVE. IT'S FAKE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU STICK IT IN A BOX, AND THEN YOU TAKE IT BACK OUT AND YOU STAPLE IT UP NEXT YEAR. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT IS -- WHAT CAN WE EXPECT? CAN WE EXPECT THIS ON THE ANIMATED SHOW?
"F IS FOR FAMILY." ALL RIGHT, SO, FOR YEARS, I'VE DONE FAILED PILOTS THAT INVOLVED REAL PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE, "OH, WELL, WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE IN TACOMA?" RIGHT? AND THEY WOULD JUST TANK THE THING. SO I FINALLY -- I DON'T KNOW, I WAS TELLING FAMILY STORIES THROUGHOUT THE BEGINNING PART OF MY CAREER. AND THEY USED TO BE CONSIDERED FUNNY. YOU KNOW? AND THEN THIS NEW GENERATION OF KIDS THAT WORE HELMETS WHEN THEY RODE BICYCLES AND HAD PLAY DATES, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] "MOMMY, CAN I GET THE MAIL?" "NO, NO!" SO IT STARTED -- THEY ALL STARTED BOMBING. ALL THESE STORIES. LIKE, WHEN I WAS A KID, IF YOU DIDN'T FINISH YOUR DINNER, OR AS WE CALLED IT, SUPPER, MY PARENTS JUST WRAPPED IT IN CELLOPHANE, AND THEN YOU HAD TO EAT IT FOR BREAKFAST. YOU REMEMBER THAT? [ APPLAUSE ] YEAH, IT WAS GREAT. IT WOULD BE HILARIOUS. CUBE STEAKS WERE THE WORST.
Jimmy: CUBE STEAKS.
RIGHT? THOSE WERE HARD ENOUGH TO CHEW AS A TODDLER WHEN YOU WERE LIKE -- WHEN IT WAS WARMED UP. AND THEN IN LIKE, THE MORNING, YOU SIT AND EAT COLD CUBED STEAK WITH GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE. EVERYBODY'S EATING WAFFLES, RIGHT?
Jimmy: CUBE STEAK.
THEN THEY GET QUIET BECAUSE THEY'RE THINKING OF A REAL KID. SO NOW, JUST IMAGINE IF IT WAS AN ANIMATED KID THAT YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST DRAWN, AND IT TOOK PLACE IN THE EARLY '70s. THAT'S WHAT THIS SHOW IS.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT, EVERYBODY. IT'S ALL FAKE. THEY'RE ALL ANIMATED. ANIMATED CHILDREN. NO CHILDREN ARE HARMED WHILE MAKING THIS. I HAVE A CLIP OF -- YOU HAVE TO COME BACK EVERY HOLIDAY SEASON.
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: THIS IS BILL BURR --
I'LL COME BACK DRESSED LIKE AN ELF.
Jimmy: "F IS FOR FAMILY." CHECK THIS OUT.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? KEVIN, HE'S FLUNKING OUT AND YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?
I WANTED YOUR FOOD TO SETTLE.
UNBELIEVABLE, UNBELIEVABLE. YOU GOT ONE JOB, PAY ATTENTION AND PASS YOUR CLASSES.
THAT'S TWO JOBS.
NO SON OF MINE IS GOING TO FLUNK OUT.
I DON'T CARE. I HATE SCHOOL.
WELL, I HATE MY LIFE, BUT I KEEP ON DOING IT. I GOT A MORTGAGE, I GOT DEPENDENTS AND I GOT TO GO DOWNTOWN EVERY DAMN DAY TO RUN THAT AIRPORT.
