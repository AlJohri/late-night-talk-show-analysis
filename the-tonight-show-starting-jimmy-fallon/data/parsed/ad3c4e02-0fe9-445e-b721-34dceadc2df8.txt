YOU LOOK GOOD. YOU LOOK GREAT. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE THE BIG STORY IS THIS DONALD STERLING MESS. LAST NIGHT WAS PART TWO OF THE ANDERSON COOPER INTERVIEW WITH STERLING. AND DURING THE INTERVIEW STERLING SAID THAT PEOPLE THINK OF HIM AS AN OGRE OR FRANKENSTEIN. WHICH ISN'T TRUE BECAUSE FRANKENSTEIN AND OGRES ARE STILL ALLOWED AT NBA BASKETBALL GAMES. THEY'RE ALLOWED TO GO. [ LAUGHTER ] STERLING ALSO TALKED TO ANDERSON COOPER ABOUT HAS HAVING A MISTRESS. HERE HE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT.
WHEN YOU'RE SO OLD, YOU DON'T THINK IT'S WRONG ANYMORE IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MY GRANDPA SAYS THE SAME THING WHEN HE LEAVES THE HOUSE WITH NO PANTS ON. WE JUST LET HIM DO IT. HE EARNED IT. [ LAUGHTER ] GUYS, SUMMER IS ALMOST HERE. YOU GUYS EXCITED ABOUT IT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EXACTLY! CAN'T WAIT! FINALLY! SUMMER IS ALMOST HERE. AND GET THIS, A NEW SURVEY FOUND THAT 88% OF PEOPLE PLAN TO TAKE A SUMMER VACATION THIS YEAR.

[ LAUGHTER ] HEY, THIS IS COOL. TODAY ALL 11 CURRENT AND FORMER CO-HOSTS OF "THE VIEW" REUNITED TO HONOR BARBARA WALTERS BEFORE HER FINAL SHOW TOMORROW. YUP, THEY ALL HAD REALLY NICE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT HER. UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS ALL AT THE SAME TIME -- [ MUTTERING ] AH, FORGET IT. GOOD LUCK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MORE TV NEWS.

[ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: YEAH, NASA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS JUST SEEMS WEIRD. A SMART PHONE COMPANY IN CHINA HAS TRADEMARKED THE WORD GROUFIE. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? GROUFIE, IT MEANS GROUP SELFIE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EVEN THE GUY WHO COINED THE WORD STAYCATION WAS LIKE, "THAT'S TOTES REDONK." [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, I THOUGHT THIS WAS PRETTY INTERESTING. A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT CHIMPS AND HUMANS SHARE EXTREMELY SIMILAR PERSONALITY TRAITS. WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT, CHIMPS SAID, "I'M SORRY I WAS TEXTING." [ LAUGHTER ] JUST LOOKING AT A COOL GROUFIE. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, MAN, LISTEN TO THIS.
