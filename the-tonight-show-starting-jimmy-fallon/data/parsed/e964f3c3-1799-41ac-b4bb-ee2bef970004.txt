[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] INTERESTING. THIS IS INTERESTING. A NEW POLL FOUND THAT DONALD TRUMP'S FAVORABILITY RATING IS UP 8 POINTS SINCE BEING ELECTED. AND HILLARY SAID, "YEAH, I WOULDN'T TRUST THE POLLS THAT MUCH." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TRUST ME. BUT TRUMP IS ALREADY BUSY GEARING UP FOR HIS FIRST TERM. IN FACT, I SAW TODAY THAT HIS TRANSITION TEAM HAS RECEIVED ITS FIRST BRIEFING FROM THE PENTAGON. TRUMP SHOULD ACTUALLY FIT IN WELL AT THE PENTAGON, SINCE HE TAKES FIVE SIDES ON EVERY ISSUE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FOR THE WAR, HE'S AGAINST THE WAR, HASN'T HEARD OF THE WAR. THIS IS BIG, THOUGH. IT CAME UP THAT TRUMP IS MEETING WITH MITT ROMNEY THIS WEEKEND ABOUT A CABINET POSITION.

Jimmy: THAT'S A BIG DEAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ THAT IS GREAT, BUDDY!
YEAH!
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WE HAVE A PHOTO FROM THE WEDDING.
YES.
Jimmy: AND THIS IS -- YOUR WIFE IS GORGEOUS.
YEAH, WE HAD KIND OF A A NERDY-THEMED WEDDING. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY, SO, THIS IS MY FAVORITE DROID. THIS IS R5-D4. HE'S THE DROID IN THE ORIGINAL "STAR WARS" THAT ALMOST GOES WITH UNCLE OWEN AND LUKE, AND THEN HE BREAKS DOWN, AND THEN, THEY GET R2D2. SO THIS IS THE ALMOST FAMOUS OF "STAR WARS," AND SO I'VE ALWAYS APPRECIATED HIM FOR THAT. I RELATE TO HIM. SO IN OUR WEDDING, HE WAS THE RING BEARER, AND HE GETS TWO-THIRDS DOWN THE AISLE AND, HE BREAKS DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BREAKS DOWN, YEAH, YEAH. YOU ARE A REAL NERD. THIS IS FANTASTIC.
SO, TO THE EXTENT WHERE I ACTUALLY E-MAILED MARK HAMILL, AND I WAS LIKE, "WOULD YOU SHOW UP AT MY WEDDING AND GO, 'OH, THIS ONE HAD A BAD MOTIVATOR," AND TAKE IT AWAY?" AND OF COURSE, HE NEVER RESPONDED.
Jimmy: HE NEVER RESPONDED, OF COURSE.
AND THEN ALL THESE JAWAS JUMP OUT, AND THEN, I WRESTLE WITH THEM. AND THEN THEY -- I GET THE RING, AND THEY TAKE THE DROID AWAY. SO, THESE -- THESE WERE THE JAWAS.
Jimmy: SO THIS REALLY HAPPENED AT YOUR WEDDING?
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU WRESTLED JAWAS? [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, REAL JAWAS, 100% REAL JAWAS.
Jimmy: YOU ARE THE BEST. YOU ARE THE MOST FUN HUMAN BEING.
THEY'RE VERY HARD TO GET THEM TO DO WHAT YOU WANT, BUT WE DID IT FOR OUR WEDDING.
Jimmy: WHAT'D YOU DO FOR YOUR BACHELOR PARTY, ANYTHING CRAZY?
I WENT TO -- I LIVE WITH DOLTS. I GET CRAZY. I WENT TO DISNEYLAND FOR MY BACHELOR PARTY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DID?
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S FUN. I LOVE DISNEY.
WE WERE STUFFING DISNEY DOLLARS IN MINNIE'S BLOOMERS. IT WAS AMAZING. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE. BUT I'M A BIG DISNEY FAN, AND I LOVE DISNEYLAND.
Jimmy: YEAH, ME TOO.
SO, YEAH, I WENT TO DISNEYLAND.
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT.
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY FUN.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD JAM. THAT'S FUN.
YEAH, AND ALL THESE KIDS WERE WALKING AROUND, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!" AND I'M LIKE, "SOMEONE'S GETTING MARRIED!" [ LAUGHTER ] "OH, BUT I'M STILL SINGLE FOR ANOTHER WEEK!" YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST LIKE --
Jimmy: "OH, I'M GOING ON SMALL WORLD TWICE! TWICE!"
YEAH, YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: "LET'S GET SOME JUNGLE CRUISE UP IN HERE!"

Jimmy: "ANIMATRONIC BEAR!" [ IMITATES AIR HORN ]
"HEY! GREAT MOMENTS WITH PRESIDENT LINCOLN!" [ IMITATES AIR HORN ] [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: HERE'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT.

Jimmy: "YOU'RE GONNA BE ON A A HALF HOUR EARLIER."

Jimmy: YOU JUST CELEBRATED ITS 100th EPISODE?
YEAH, 100th EPISODE OF "THE TALKING DEAD," YEAH. I KNOW. IT'S CRAZY. YEAH, I KNOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I KNOW.
Jimmy: YOU'RE GREAT AT IT.
THANK YOU. IT'S SORT OF THERAPY. IT'S SORT OF -- I, YOU KNOW, I USED TO THINK -- I USED TO THINK "TALKING DEAD" WAS THERAPY FOR "WALKING DEAD," AND THEN THE SEASON SIX FINALE HAPPENED LAST SEASON. AND, SOME PEOPLE WERE UPSET BECAUSE THERE WAS A A CLIFFHANGER.
Jimmy: YUP.
AND THEN, I REALIZED AFTER GETTING YELLED AT A LOT ON TWITTER, NO, I'M CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR "WALKING DEAD." THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT I AM. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING, "I KNOW YOU DIDN'T WRITE THIS, BUT YOU REPRESENT THE COMPANY, AND I NEED TO" -- YOU KNOW. IT WAS A LOT OF ME GOING, "SIR, I'M SORRY. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?"
Jimmy: "HAVE YOU TRIED UNPLUGGING IT AND PLUGGING IT BACK IN?" [ LAUGHTER ]
"HAVE YOU TRIED UNPLUGGING IT? COUNT TO TEN. PLUG IT BACK IN." THAT'S ALL I KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU TO DO.
Jimmy: NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT "THE WALL."
YES.
Jimmy: YOU DID IT?
WE DID A SHOW CALLED "THE WALL," A GAME SHOW. LeBRON JAMES WAS ONE OF THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS.
Jimmy: LeBRON JAMES PRODUCED THIS SHOW WITH YOU?
YEAH, YEAH, HE DID.
Jimmy: HOW COOL IS THAT?
HE'S THE NICEST GUY.
Jimmy: HE'S THE COOLEST DUDE.
I MEAN, HE'S -- BESIDES BEING INCREDIBLY TALENTED AND AN INCREDIBLY SMART BUSINESS MAN, IF HE WAS KIND OF A JERK, YOU'D BE LIKE, "I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A PASS ON THIS ONE."
Jimmy: YEAH.
HE'S THE MOST GENEROUS, ENGAGING --
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SUCH A LOVELY MAN WITH A A GREAT FAMILY. HE'S, LIKE, HE'S INSPIRING TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE LIKE, "TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH, ALL RIGHT? THE REST OF US" --
Jimmy: AND I LIKE HIS FRIEND. HE HAS THE SAME FRIENDS HE HAD FROM HIGH SCHOOL --
SAME FRIENDS, YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THEY ALL HANG OUT WITH HIM.
MAKING AMAZING STUFF.
Jimmy: BEYOND, BEYOND AMAZING STUFF, I MEAN, HE'S CHARITABLE, AND HE'S A GOOD DUDE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT WHAT IS THIS GAME SHOW ABOUT, "THE WALL"? WHAT IS IT?
I ALWAYS WANTED TO HOST A A BIG FLASHY GAME SHOW, AND THIS IS A BIG, FLASHY, EMOTIONAL GAME SHOW WHERE WE'VE BUILT THIS FOUR-STORY -- DO YOU KNOW WHAT PACHINKO IS, LIKE, THE VERTICAL JAPANESE PINBALL GAME WHERE THE BALL SHOOTS UP AND COMES DOWN THE PEG?
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, PLINKO.
NOW, I KIND OF FELT LIKE I WAS PLAYING A GAME IN THE SECOND ACT OF THE SHOW. "IT'S A BIG WALL!"
Jimmy: OKAY.
"AND A BALL!"
Jimmy: "YEAH, YEAH!"
"COMES DOWN!"
Jimmy: "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!"
"HE'S GOT IT! HE'S GOT IT! HE'S GOT IT!"
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, OKAY. AL PACINKO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE --
AL PACINKO, YEAH!
Jimmy: FROM "SCARFACE."
YEAH, YEAH, AL PACINKO!
Jimmy: "SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND." YOU KNOW AL PACINKO. [ LAUGHTER ]
"YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING PUT YOUR BALLS IN ME?" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE -- THAT'S THE SLOGAN.
THAT'S THE SLOGAN, YEAH.
Jimmy: WE HAVE A LITTLE CLIP OF -- JUST BASICALLY EXPLAINING WHAT THE SHOW IS.
YEAH, YEAH, HERE'S THE SHOW, YEAH.
Jimmy: HERE'S A SNEAK PEEK OF "THE WALL." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THIS IS A GAME WHERE WE GIVE PEOPLE THAT SHOT TO WIN.
2.7 MILLION!
CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND TO LIVE OUT THEIR DREAMS.
THERE'S ONE SIMPLE RULE. IF YOU GET SOMETHING RIGHT IN THIS GAME AND THE BALLS TURN GREEN. THEY ADD TO YOUR TOTAL. WHEN YOU'RE WRONG IN THIS GAME, THE BALLS TURN RED, AND THOSE SUBTRACT FROM YOUR TOTAL. "THE WALL" GIVES AND THE WALL TAKES AWAY.
$500,000.
OH, MY GOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU CAN WIN BIG, I MEAN, MORE THAN YOU EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. ♪♪ WELCOME TO "THE WALL." ♪♪
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CONGRATULATIONS, BUDDY.
NOW, JUST REAL QUICK.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I KNOW YOU'RE AT HOME. YOU'RE LIKE, "YOU'RE JUST DROPPING A BALL DOWN A WALL." I KNOW. I SAID THAT BEFORE I ACTUALLY PLAYED THE GAME. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST ENGAGING, EMOTIONAL BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE TEAM THE ENTIRE TIME OF TWO PEOPLE. YOU GET TO KNOW THEM. YOU EMPATHIZE WITH THEM. AND THEY'LL BE UP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND THEN TWO SECONDS LATER BE OUT OF MONEY AND THEN BACK UP AGAIN. SO, JUST GIVE IT A SHOT IS WHAT I'M SAYING.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "THE WALL" PREMIERS JANUARY 3RD AT 8:00 P.M. ON NBC. EMELI SANDE PERFORMS NEXT. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
