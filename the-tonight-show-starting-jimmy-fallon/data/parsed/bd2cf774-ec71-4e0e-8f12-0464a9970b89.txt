[ AUDIENCE OHS ] IT GOT A LITTLE AWKWARD WHEN BERNIE STOOD UP AND SAID, "I KNEW ALEXANDER HAMILTON. AND YOU, SIR, ARE NO ALEXANDER HAMILTON!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE KNEW HIM.
Steve: THEY WERE FRIENDS.
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, THE DEBATE WILL BE HELD OVER IN BROOKLYN. AND TO KEEP IT AUTHENTIC TO BROOKLYN, EACH CANDIDATE WILL DEBATE BY JUST SHOUTING OUT A A WINDOW AT EACH OTHER. [ LAUGHTER ] "YOUR PLANS ARE NO GOOD!" "YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!" AND GET THIS, BERNIE SANDERS SAID ON FRIDAY THAT HIS GOAL FOR FINANCIAL REFORM IS TO "MAKE BANKING BORING AGAIN."

I GOTTA SAY MAN, SOMETIMES I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT. IT'S JUST LIKE, IT DOESN'T SEEM REAL. LIKE THIS YEAR WHEN WE WENT TO THE OSCARS IT WAS LIKE, "MAN, I WAS ACTUALLY ON THIS STAGE PERFORMING." I HAD BETTER SEATS, OF COURSE, THIS YEAR. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, IT ALL HAPPENS.
IT HAPPENS. AND I GET A LITTLE LOVE, YOU KNOW, AT RESTAURANTS, I GET FED A LITTLE QUICKER. BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING I'M JUST GRATEFUL FOR IT, MAN. I'M LIKE, YO, I'M GRATEFUL.
Jimmy: BUT YOU DID ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS. YOU BROUGHT YOUR MOM TO THE OSCARS WHEN YOU WON.
THAT WAS -- SHE LOVED IT, MAN. THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES, JUST SEEING HOW HAPPY SHE WAS. SHE LOOKED -- WE HAD HER DONE UP. SHE HAD HER GLAM SQUAD THERE. I GOT HER A LITTLE GLAM SQUAD.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
IT FELT GREAT, MAN. SHE WAS SUPER HAPPY.
Jimmy: AND YOU GOT TO MEET ALL SORTS OF -- MERYL STREEP, LIKE, KNEW WHO YOU WERE? THAT'S PRETTY COOL.
YEAH, IT'S LIKE --
Jimmy: THAT'S ALWAYS A A THING. YOU GO, "HEY, THAT'S COOL. I KNOW YOU, BUT --" YEAH. SHE KNEW YOU.
THAT'S THE -- THAT'S THE LEVEL. WHEN MERYL STREEP KNOWS YOU, YOU FEEL LIKE, "I'M DOING SOMETHING." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO BE PERFORMING "REAL PEOPLE" OFF THE SOUNDTRACK OF "BARBERSHOP: THE NEXT CUT." THIS IS -- YOU AND ICE CUBE, YOU OPENED FOR NWA IN THE '80s?
YEAH, IN THE LATE '80s I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL WITH MY GROUP. AND I OPENED UP FOR ICE CUBE AND NWA, EAZY-E, TOO SHORT.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?
IT WAS INCREDIBLE. I MEAN, BUT I DIDN'T GET TO INTERACT WITH THEM THAT MUCH. BUT JUST TO BE ABLE TO SAY, "MAN, I'M OPENING UP FOR NWA," WAS INCREDIBLE. LIKE, IN HIGH SCHOOL?
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S A BIG DEAL.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WELL, THIS MOVIE -- OBVIOUSLY IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE "BARBERSHOP" MOVIES, BUT IT ALSO HAS A -- KIND OF A NICE MESSAGE OVERALL.
YEAH.
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S A FUN MOVIE. IT'S A COMEDY, BUT IT HAS A A MESSAGE WITH THE HEART ABOUT IT. REALLY THE COMMUNITY -- COMMUNITIES TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES. BECAUSE IT'S BASED IN CHICAGO. AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO. BUT THE MOVIE ENDS OFF, YOU KNOW, DEFINITELY WITH HOPE AND INSPIRATION, BUT IT DEALS WITH THE SUBJECT IN A REAL WAY.
Jimmy: AND CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER, YOU KNOW HE'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES. HE JUST MAKES YOU LAUGH, HE'S JUST UNBELIEVABLY FUNNY.
INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: WELL, SINCE IT'S SET IN A BARBER SHOP, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE KIND OF FUN TO SEE -- WHAT IF WE SWITCHED LOOKS? 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T KNOW, MAN. WHAT YOU THINK?
Jimmy: I THINK -- I WAS DOUBTING IT AT FIRST, BUT I THINK IT'S A SMART THING. I THINK IT'S GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU THINK SO?
Jimmy: YEAH, I ALMOST KNOW. I MANAGED MY SHOW. HERE'S YOU WITH NO BEARD AND MY HAIR. THIS IS COMMON. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, MAN, THAT'S BAD, MAN. THAT'S BAD, BRO. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT BAD, DUDE.
THAT'S BAD, DUDE.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT BAD. THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD LOOKING. I LIKE THAT DUDE.
NO, JIMMY.
Jimmy: HE LOOKS LIKE A DUDE I WANT TO HANG OUT WITH.
NO, MAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND THEN YOU GO, "OH, THAT'S PERFECT." YOU GO, "NO, EVEN MORE PERFECT?" IF I TOOK YOUR BEARD AND YOUR BALD LOOK.
DON'T DO IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
OH, NO! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT BAD.
THAT'S A LITTLE BEN KINGSLEY RIGHT THERE.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT LOOKS LIKE A TOUGH CHARLIE BROWN. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS TERRIBLE.
STICK TO WHAT WE GOT.
Jimmy: YEAH, WE'RE GONNA STICK TO -- I HAVE A CLIP I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE HERE. HERE IS COMMON IN "BARBERSHOP: THE NEXT CUT." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
SO, YOU PLAYING CELEBRITY BARBER, AND I'M MR. MOM, NOW?
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID YOU WANTED TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH MAYA AND KENNY. SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
SOME TIME. HALF YOUR CLIENTS WAS MINE TO START.
OH, YOU COMPLAINING NOW? WHEN KENNY'S MOM ASKED IF HE COULD SPEND THE REMAINDER OF HIGH SCHOOL WITH US, I WAS COOL WITH IT. BUT SINCE HE'S BEEN WITH US, HE'S DONE NOTHING TO HELP OUT.
YEAH, COME ON, NOW.
IT'S LIKE WE HAVE TWO TODDLERS IN THE HOUSE.
IT'S A NEW SITUATION!
IT'S NOT A NEW SITUATION, IT TOOK A YEAR!
IT'S TAKING A LITTLE TIME, YOU HOW LONG -- [ SHOUTING OVER EACH OTHER ]
ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL. STOP! YO, DO Y'ALL NEED A MINUTE? BECAUSE WE'LL ALL LEAVE.
I'M GON' LEAVE. IT'S LIKE "LOVE AND HIP-HOP" REUNION IN HERE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "LOVE AND HIP-HOP" REUNION. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "BARBERSHOP: THE NEXT CUT." HEY, WE HAD GABRIELLE UNION HERE. AND SHE SAID -- SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD. BUT SHE SAID THE HIGHLIGHT OF HER WEDDING WAS YOU BREAK DANCING.
YEAH. THAT WAS FUN. BUT I ENDED UP SPLITTING MY PANTS TRYING TO BREAK DANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT WASN'T THE HIGHLIGHT FOR ME. I HAD A GOOD TIME, BUT --
Jimmy: THESE PANTS LOOK KIND OF STRETCHYISH. THEY'RE NOT THAT BAD. IS THERE ANY WAY -- ANY WAY. ANY WAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ THE ROOTS, THE ROOTS!
ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: WITH THE ROOTS, TOO.
LOOK, IF I SPLIT MY PANTS, YOU GOT ME, RIGHT?
