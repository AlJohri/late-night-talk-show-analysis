EIGHT PRIOR TIMES.
EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE SAID THE EXACT SAME THINGS --
SECRETARY, SENATOR, PLEASE.
IF WE CAN RAISE IT TO 15 IN NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES, LET'S DO IT.
SECRETARY --
IF YOU'RE BOTH SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER, THE VIEWERS WON'T BE ABLE TO HEAR EITHER OF YOU. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

TEN, ELEVEN DAYS.
Jimmy: OF EVENTS AND FUN THINGS. WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS?
WELL, ORIGINALLY IT WAS BECAUSE OF 9/11, AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS DEPRESSED AND NOTHING WAS HAPPENING DOWN THERE. SO WE HAD -- WE WOULD GO TO RESTAURANTS IN THE AREA AND TRY AND DRUM UP BUSINESS FOR THE RESTAURANTS THERE. THEN WE'D ALWAYS BEEN TALKING ABOUT DOING A FILM FESTIVAL, BUT NEVER SERIOUSLY. AND THEN WHEN 9/11 HAPPENED, WE THOUGHT, WELL, MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD HAPPEN THAT WOULD HELP TO REVITALIZE LOWER MANHATTAN AND DA-DA-DA -- THAT'S HOW IT STARTED.
Jimmy: I REMEMBER THE FIRST YEAR, I DID A BIT WITH YOU ON THE FIRST YEAR OF THE TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL, IT WAS GREAT. YOU GUYS DIDN'T HAVE A CLOSING CEREMONY BECAUSE YOU JUST FIGURED, I JUST EVERYONE STAY HERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] NOBODY LEAVE. JUST BRING BUSINESS BACK TO DOWNTOWN.

BUT IT WAS INTERESTING. JUST THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE OF GETTING A SENSE OF WHAT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, AND THIS PARTICULAR EXHIBIT, IF YOU WILL, WAS ABOUT THAT. AND FORGIVE ME, EVERYONE, THE ORGANIZATION THAT HAD ME GO IN THERE, BUT IT WAS ABOUT SHOWING HOW HORRIBLE IT WAS.
Jimmy: YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO EVENTUALLY -- I GUESS IT PROBABLY HAS ALREADY HAPPENED. BUT IS FILM GOING TO GO THAT WAY?
YEAH. I MEAN, THE THING THAT I WAS THINKING OF IS THAT, YOU KNOW, I WAS LOOKING DOWN. AND I WAS LOOKING AT THE DOOR WHERE THERE WAS A WINDOW WHERE THE GUARD PASSES AND STUFF.
Jimmy: WERE YOU TRYING TO ESCAPE?
NO, NO. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I WANTED TO GET UP AND GO OVER THERE, AND IF I GOT UP AND I WAS IN A SITUATION LIKE THERE'S A STEP OR SOMETHING, I COULD TRIP BECAUSE YOU FORGET THAT YOU'RE NOT --

YEAH, I HAD DONE "GODFATHER II" AND JUST FINISHED "1900" WITH BERNARDO BERTOLUCCI, AND WAS IN ITALY FOR ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS. AND SO, AS SOON AS I GOT BACK, WE STARTED A FEW WEEKS LATER "TAXI DRIVER."
Jimmy: DID YOU SEE THE -- BY THE WAY, BECAUSE I'M THINKING OF "GODFATHER." MARLON BRANDO DOCUMENTARY?
I DID.
Jimmy: "LISTEN TO ME?" WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT?
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.
Jimmy: IT STARTS OFF, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW IT. BUT YOU CAN GET IT ON SOMETHING, YOUTUBE OR SOMETHING.

Jimmy: SHOWTIME OR SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ] IT STARTS OFF WITH A HOLOGRAM OF HIS FACE. AND HE'S GOING LIKE -- [ BRANDO VOICE ] "THIS IS THE FUTURE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS -- THE PEOPLE -- THERE ARE GONNA BE NO MORE ACTORS AND IT'S GOING TO BE A VIRTUAL." HE CALLS IT LIKE VIRTUAL REALITY IS GOING TO BE THE FUTURE. I GO, THAT'S SO INTERESTING TO SEE MARLON BRANDO IN THAT DOCUMENTARY WITH THE HOLOGRAM HEAD OF HIS, BUT IT'S HIS REAL VOICE TALKING. THEN THIS IS ROBERT DE NIRO IN VIRTUAL REALITY IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. THIS IS ALL THE FUTURE. THIS IS ALL HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. I'VE DONE IT A LITTLE BIT IN SOME THE MOVIES, BUT I'M DOING IT IN THE MOVIE WITH SCORSESE THAT HAS A TITLE NOW CALLED "THE IRISHMAN" WHERE THERE WERE EARLIER YEARS WHERE WE'RE YOUNGER AND WE'VE BEEN DOING TESTS TO SHOW THAT WE'RE, YOU KNOW, THAT WE'RE YOUNGER, OBVIOUSLY, 30 YEARS OR SO. AND SO THAT'S COMING ALONG VERY NICELY. A LOT OF PEOPLE STARTING TO DO IT MORE. AS YOU SEE IN "BENJAMIN BUTTON," THEY DID IT. SO IT'S GETTING MORE AND MORE PERFECTED.

EXACTLY. NO, IT'S ABOUT THIS GUY SAM WHO'S A RESERVATIONIST AT A A VERY HOT RESTAURANT. AND NO ONE CAN GET A TABLE. AND I PLAY ALL THE PEOPLE CALLING IN TO THE RESTAURANT TRYING TO GET A TABLE. I ALSO PLAY THE FRENCH MAITRE D', I PLAY THE HOSTESS, I PLAY GWYNETH PALTROW'S ASSISTANT, BRICE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT'S 40 CHARACTERS IN A A 90-MINUTE SHOW, AND I'M PLAYING EVERYONE.

ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO, YEAH.
Jimmy: AND YOU BLEW EVERYONE'S MIND THEN.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IS IT EASIER, DIFFERENT THAN A MUSICAL? HARDER?
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO SING. BUT, LIKE, IT TRULY IS LIKE SINGING FOR 90 MINUTES BECAUSE I'M USING ALL DIFFERENT OCTAVES OF MY VOICE. YOU KNOW, I'M UP HIGH FOR SOME OF THE WOMEN ROLES, IT'S DOWN LOW FOR -- I HAVE A GUY WHO HAS LARYNGITIS. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE -- SO IT'S LIKE ALL OVER THE MAP. SO BASICALLY I'M LIKE THE ELPHABA OF THE SEASON IF YOU KNOW "WICKED." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. DO YOU HAVE TO DO LIKE VOCAL WARM-UPS AND EXERCISES AND TEAS?
I'M WORKING WITH THIS VOCAL COACH, KATE WILSON, WHO'S ON THE STAFF AT JUILLIARD. AND SHE GIVES ME ALL THESE GREAT VOCAL WARM-UPS. SHE HELPED ME WITH MY ACCENTS. BUT I HAVE TO LIKE WARM UP BEFORE THE SHOW AS IF I'M ABOUT TO SING. SO LIKE -- I DO LIKE THESE WEIRD THINGS. LIKE, TO GET MY RESONATORS WORKING SHE HAS ME DOING -- THEY'RE SO WEIRD, BY THE WAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SHE HAS ME DO THIS THING WHERE I PUT MY HAND OVER MY FACE AND I GO -- MY MIND IS MY OWN. [ LAUGHTER ] MY MIND -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT? SO IF YOU'RE WALKING PAST YOUR DRESSING ROOM --
Both: MY MIND IS MY OWN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: MY MIND IS MY OWN.

Jimmy: I DO.
YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WOW. THAT'S A GREAT ONE. YOU DO THAT. SO COULD YOU -- I DON'T MEAN TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT, BUT YOU'RE HERE. COULD YOU GIVE ME A TASTE OF ANY OF THE CHARACTERS?
WELL, LIKE I HAVE A FRENCH MAITRE D' NAMED JEAN-CLAUDE. HE'S LIKE -- [ FRENCH ACCENT ] "I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS. I DIDN'T KNOW WHO JUSTIN BIEBER WAS. I WOULD HAVE HAD A TABLE READY FOR HIM." HE'S SORT OF LIKE, BASICALLY LIKE OUT OF "RATATOUILLE." AND THEN I HAVE -- MY HOSTESS IS FROM EAST LONDON AND I KIND OF MODELED HER OFF OF ADELE. SHE'S LIKE "THANK YOU. A PHOTOGRAPHER FROM 'BON APPETIT' MAGAZINE HERE FOR THE SHARE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE CHEF IS ACTUALLY LIKE A A DUDE WHO'S LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MY FROZEN POLENTA?" [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S KIND OF LIKE A JERK.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT YOU MANSPREAD.
I HAVE TO MANSPREAD A LITTLE THERE. I HAVE TO. THAT'S PART OF THE CHARACTER. THAT'S WHY I CAN GET SO LOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, UH -- WE LOVE HAVING YOU HERE, ALWAYS. AND CONGRATS ON EVERYTHING. I'M GOING TO COME, I'M GOING TO SNEAK IN.
YEAH, PLEASE DO.
Jimmy: I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU WHEN I'M COMING.
YOU CAN BUY A TICKET. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SNEAK IN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, I'M GOING TO BUY A TICKET. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU I'M COMING. YOU KNOW I'M A GIANT FAN OF YOURS. AND EVERYONE, YOU HAVE TO GO SEE JESSE TYLER FERGUSON ON "FULLY COMMITTED" AT THE LYCEUM THEATRE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GO TO FULLYCOMMITTEDBROADWAY.COM TO GET TICKETS. GOES UNTIL JULY 24th.

WHAT'S UP? HELLO, "TONIGHT SHOW." HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING? [ CHEERS ] AWESOME, AWESOME. WE'LL GET STARTED. I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT IF I KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO SEE ANY OF YOU TOMORROW, I'M GOING TO WEAR THE SAME CLOTHES TOMORROW. ANYBODY ELSE LIKE THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT? BECAUSE SOMETIMES, YOU'RE LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT, I ONLY WORE THIS FOR FOUR HOURS AND IT WAS MOSTLY IN AIR CONDITIONING. I CAN WEAR IT AGAIN." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M ADDICTED TO ONLINE ARTICLES, RIGHT? I LOVE RELATIONSHIP ADVICE, ESPECIALLY BAD RELATIONSHIP ADVICE. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YEAH -- IT'S PERFECT, ISN'T IT? BECAUSE YOU'LL ALWAYS SEE, LIKE, ARTICLES WHERE IT'S LIKE "WE INTERVIEWED 100 MEN AND HERE'S THE TWO THINGS THEY WANT IN A WOMAN" OR "WE INTERVIEWED TWO WOMEN AND HERE'S THE 146 THINGS THEY WANT IN A MAN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NUMBER ONE TRAIT? NUMBER ONE TRAIT ON THAT LIST, HEIGHT. WOMEN WANT A TALL GUY, RIGHT? YEAH, YEAH. I'M 5'5", THANK YOU, LADIES. [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW. THEY WANT HEIGHT BECAUSE WHEN THEY GO OUT, THEY WANT TO WEAR HEELS, LIVE IT UP AND FEEL PROTECTED. I'M NOT DOING ANY OF THAT FOR YOU. OKAY? I GOT THIS SUIT FROM A A BUILD-A-BEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT INTIMIDATING. RIGHT? I'M NOT INTIMIDATING. I'M PETITE. ALL RIGHT? YEAH, I KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE. ONE TIME, I STOOD NEAR A A WOMAN'S RESTROOM, AND A LINE FORMED BEHIND ME. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] FOR 10 MINUTES I JUST STOOD THERE, AND A LINE OF WOMEN JUST FORMED -- WAITING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG. I'LL NEVER STOP A GIRL THAT I GO OUT WITH FROM HAVING A GOOD TIME, RIGHT? GIRLS JUST WANT TO TURN DOWN FOR WHAT. [ LAUGHTER ] NEVER STOP THEM. BECAUSE IT'S FUN FOR ME. YOU KNOW? BECAUSE THEN I GET TO FIGURE OUT HOW DRUNK SHE IS. YEAH. YEAH, BECAUSE WOMEN COME IN THREE LEVELS OF DRUNK. BOSSY, FLIRTY AND SLEEPY. THERE'S THREE LEVELS. AND IT'S ALWAYS IN THAT ORDER. BOSSY COMES FIRST, RIGHT? YOU EVER NOTICE THAT AFTER A A GLASS OF WINE OR ONE BEER. YOUR GIRL'S LIKE "GUESS WHO'S HERE?" AND SHE JUST STARTS HASHTAGGING THINGS. LIKE, #IRUNTHIS, #DOINGBIGTHINGS. #BEYONCEHALFTIME. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GUYS ARE SO NICE. IF YOU'VE BEEN WITH YOUR WOMAN LONG ENOUGH, RIGHT? YOU KNOW ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS MATCH HER DEMEANOR, AND YOU'LL SURVIVE THE NIGHT. RIGHT? YEAH, SO IF SHE GETS EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING, YOU GET EXCITED ABOUT THE SAME THING. AND IF SHE GETS MAD AT SOMETHING, YOU BETTER GET MAD AT THE SAME THING. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, OR SHE'LL GET MAD AT YOU. BECAUSE WOMEN ARE LIKE TUPAC WHEN IT COMES TO EMOTIONS. YEAH, THEY'RE LIKE "YOU WITH ME OR NOT? RIDE OR DIE. WE'RE GOING AFTER THE LABEL, STAFF AND THEIR CREW." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CALM DOWN, BECKY! AFTER A FEW MORE DRINKS, FLIRTY SHOWS UP, RIGHT? AND EVERY MAN CAN TELL WHEN HIS WOMAN'S FEELING FLIRTY, BECAUSE ONE EYELID STARTS CLOSING MORE THAN THE OTHER. YOU EVER NOTICE THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT? SHE LOOKS LIKE A SEXY PIRATE. SHE'S LIKE "GRR, GRR." YOU'VE GOT TO GET HER HOME. IF THAT EYELID IS AT HALF-MAST, YOU GOT TO GET HER HOME, SHE'S ABOUT TO LOSE HER DEPTH PERCEPTION, AND WALKING BECOMES OPTIONAL. OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] IT DOES. ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE IN FULL GO OUT MODE WHERE THEY'VE GOT THE TIGHT DRESS THAT THEY'RE CONSTANTLY PULLING DOWN AND PICKING UP, PULLING DOWN AND PICKING UP. RIGHT? YEAH. THEY'VE GOT THE 4-INCH HEELS. YOU KNOW? THEN THE BIG PURSE. HAVE YOU SEEN THE FACE OF THAT WOMAN? SHE'S JUST LIKE "KEEP IT TOGETHER, KEEP IT TOGETHER, KEEP IT TOGETHER." [ LAUGHTER ] "I WISH I HAD WEDGES." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ONE TIME, I WENT OUT WITH A A GIRL WHO GOT SO DRUNK, SHE JUST GAVE UP ON MOVEMENT. HALFWAY THROUGH THE DATE. YEAH, SHE WAS JUST SLOWLY KNEELING DOWN. AND SHE'S JUST LIKE, "IT'S OKAY. GO ON WITHOUT ME. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL DANCE TO MY CELL PHONE. IT'S OKAY." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S FUN. YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN YOUR WOMAN'S FEELING FLIRTY AND GOOD, RIGHT, WHEN SHE GOES FROM TALKING TO EVERYBODY TO JUST SITTING BY HERSELF IN A CORNER. YEAH, AND GIGGLING TO HERSELF. JUST GIGGLING, JUST [ GIGGLING ] FEELING MYSELF. FEELING MYSELF. I'M CUTE, RIGHT, BABE? THAT'S ALL THEY WANT TO KNOW WHEN THEY'RE DRUNK. HOW CUTE ARE THEY? WOMEN LOVE THE WORD CUTE. SOME OF YOU PERKED UP WHEN I SAID IT, RIGHT? AND THEY'LL TEST YOU. "I'M CUTE, RIGHT, BABE?" YES, BABE, YOU'RE CUTE. "I'M CUTER THAN EVERYTHING EVER. RIGHT, BABE?" YES, YOU'RE CUTER THAN ALL THE EVERS. "I'M CUTER THAN ALL YOUR DUMB EXES. RIGHT, BABE?" YES, BABE, YOU'RE CUTER THAN ALL MY DUMB EXES. "BECAUSE SOPHIA WAS CUTE, BUT I'M CUTER THAN SOPHIA, RIGHT?" THAT'S A TRICK QUESTION. OKAY? YEAH, BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT YOU ON THE TELEMARKETER. YES, YES, YES, YES ROLL. SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY, YES, YOU'RE CUTER THAN SOPHIA. "SO YOU'VE BEEN COMPARING US, HUH?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY GOT YOU. BECAUSE WOMEN ALWAYS WANTG TO SEE IF THEY CAN PULL YOU INTO AN ARGUMENT, RIGHT? THEY PREPARE ARGUMENTS FOR WEEKS. THEY MAKE ARGUMENTS LIKE SPIDERS MAKE WEBS, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DO, THEY ALWAYS GET THEM READY. THEY'RE LIKE "AND HE DIDN'T SAY I WAS CUTE. AND HE HAD LUNCH WITHOUT ME. AND HE HANGS OUT WITH TODD, AND I HATE TODD." AND THEY SET UP AN ARGUMENT WEB, WITH A BUNCH OF POINTS THAT ONLY MAKE SENSE TO THEM. AND A BUNCH OF THINGS YOU SAID THAT YOU DON'T REMEMBER YOU SAID THEM, BUT THEY REMEMBER YOU SAID THEM. THEY REMEMBER EVERYTHING YOU SAID EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE RELATIONSHIP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THEY TWIST AND THEY TIE AND THEY MAKE IT REAL STICKY, AND THEY'RE JUST LIKE "AHH!" THEY JUST SIT THERE. AND IT'S LIKE CHARLOTTE'S WEB. IT JUST SAYS BOSS, RIGHT AT THE TOP. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M NICK GUERRA. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
