Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- KATIE HOLMES, DAVID WAIN AND MICHAEL SHOWALTER, MUSICAL GUEST, SAGE THE GEMINI FEATURING NICK JONAS, AND THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 297, ARUBA. AND NOW HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: OH, HEY. MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD RIGHT THERE. WELCOME EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. WE MADE IT. THIS IS GREAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. HERE IS WHAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. IT'S STILL, OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] FANTASTIC FOR US. TODAY TRUMP WENT TO TEXAS TO VISIT THE BORDER BETWEEN THE U.S. AND MEXICO. AND THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. WHEN HE GOT THERE, OTHER REPUBLICANS PUSHED HIM OVER THE BORDER AND WENT, "YOUR PROBLEM NOW! [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GOT TO DEAL WITH IT NOW. NOT US. HE'S ON YOUR SIDE." AND GET THIS. DID YOU SEE THIS? THE FEC RELEASED DONALD TRUMP'S FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE YESTERDAY, AND IT REVEALED THAT HE RECEIVED ROYALTIES OF LESS THAN 200 DOLLARS FOR MOST OF HIS BOOKS. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. THE BAD NEWS IS, THE BOOKS AREN'T SELLING. THE GOOD NEWS IS, LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO BUILD THAT MEXICAN FENCE WITH. [ LAUGHTER ] "IT'S A VERY CLASSY BOOK-FENCE. PAPERBACK. MY FAVORITE BEATLES SONG, "PAPERBACK FENCE." [ LAUGHTER ] TRUMP'S BOOK "THE ART OF THE DEAL" ACTUALLY DID SELL REALLY WELL. BUT I THINK YOU CAN TELL WHY SOME OF HIS OTHER BOOKS DIDN'T WORK OUT. LOOK AT THE OTHER TITLES, HERE. FIRST THERE IS "GETTING FRIENDS TO TRUST YOU WITH THEIR PHONE NUMBER." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, NO ONE'S GONNA READ THAT. NO. NEXT THERE'S "HOW TO SPEAK LIKE YOU'RE IN A TUNNEL." "IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SPEAK. EVERYONE SHOULD LEARN TO DO IT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IN CASE YOU GET TRAPPED IN A A TUNNEL." [ APPLAUSE ] NO ONE'S GOING TO BUY THAT. HERE'S THE LAST ONE, HERE. FINALLY, "ARE YOU THERE GOP? IT'S ME, DONALD." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, IT'S A GOOD PICTURE. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT -- AND IN A SPEECH IN WASHINGTON, RICK PERRY DENOUNCED DONALD TRUMP AND DESCRIBED HIM AS A "BARKING CARNIVAL ACT." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS A PRETTY BOLD STATEMENT COMING FROM THE "SWORD SWALLOWER." [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: DOINK. DOINK. DON'T DO IT.
Jimmy: DON'T HAVE A CORN DOG.
Steve: DON'T HAVE A CORN DOG AT A STATE FAIR.
Jimmy: THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS TO EAT AT A STATE FAIR.
Steve: HAVE A FRIED OREO. COTTON CANDY. EAT THE WHOLE BUTTER COW. I DON'T CARE.
Jimmy: COTTON CANDY. ANYTHING. CORN ON THE COB.
Steve: YEAH, SIDEWAYS.
Jimmy: YEAH, SIDEWAYS. THANK YOU. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE GEORGE PATAKI SAID THAT HIS DOGS WOULD GIVE HIM THE BEST ENDORSEMENT FOR BECOMING OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, UNTIL THEY HEAR CHRIS CHRISTIE ALWAYS CARRIES BACON IN HIS POCKETS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW, BUT IT'S TRUE. MEANWHILE, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE BEN CARSON TOLD REPORTERS HE THINKS AMERICAN PRISONS MIGHT BE TOO COMFORTABLE. AS OPPOSED TO MEXICAN PRISONS THAT HAVE PERSONAL SHOWERS WITH $5 MILLION ESCAPE TUNNELS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] EL CHAPO! YEAH. WE'RE TOO COMFORTABLE OVER HERE. HEY, THIS IS KINDA HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT ONE DIRECTION JUST CELEBRATED ITS FIFTH ANNIVERSARY AS A BAND. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. YOU CAN TELL THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR FIVE YEARS JUST FROM THE TITLE OF THEIR NEW SONG CALLED "WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO FOR DINNER? I DON'T CARE WHATEVER YOU WANT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS COOL. DR. SUESS'S UNPUBLISHED MANUSCRIPT CALLED "WHAT PET SHOULD I GET" WAS RELEASED THIS WEEK. MARKING HIS THIRD PUBLICATION IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS. EVEN TUPAC WAS LIKE, "ARE WE SURE THIS GUY'S DEAD? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, MY NAME'S LARRY, WELCOME TO APPLEBEE'S." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS ISN'T GOOD HERE. THERE WERE REPORTS THAT CLAIM THAT HACKERS ARE ABLE TO BREAK INTO THE UCONNECT SYSTEM IN CHRYSLER CARS AND TAKE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLES REMOTELY. THOUGH, BASED ON THE AVERAGE AGE OF PEOPLE WHO DRIVE CHRYSLERS, THAT PROBABLY MAKES THEM SAFER. [ LAUGHTER ] "WHICH ONE'S THE BRAKE AGAIN? [ APPLAUSE ] I'M GONNA ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW." FOLKS, THERE ARE RUMORS THAT HOSTESS IS PLANNING TO RELEASE A PRODUCT BEING DESCRIBED AS FROZEN FRIED TWINKIES. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE THE NAME, "LABORATORY CREATED DIABETES BOMB WAS TOO CLUNKY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOT EASILY --
Steve: DOESN'T ROLL OFF THE TONGUE.
Jimmy: IT DOESN'T ROLL OFF THE TONGUE. AND DID YOU HEAR THE REPORTS? SONY PICTURES IS DEVELOPING A A NEW MOVIE BASED ON EMOJIS. AT THIS POINT, WE'RE FIVE YEARS AWAY FROM KIDS ASKING, "MOM, WHAT WERE WORDS?" [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, SONY PICTURES IS DEVELOPING AN ANIMATED MOVIE BASED ON EMOJIS. MEANWHILE, PARENTS ARE LIKE, "WAIT, THEN WHAT THE HELL ARE MINIONS?!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, THE EMOJI MOVIE SOUNDS INTERESTING. IN FACT THEY EVEN SHOT A FEW TEST SCENES ALREADY, BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE IT WORKS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ]
JESSICA, I NEED TO COME CLEAN. I'M IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

Steve: U2 HAD A GREAT NIGHT?
Jimmy: NO, WE -- SO LAST NIGHT I PERFORMED AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN ON STAGE WITH U2, AND I SANG A SONG WITH THEM. AND IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THEN THE ROOTS CAME OUT AND THEY PERFORMED WITH THE BAND AS WELL. AND IT WAS JUST AN UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE. I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. BUT IT ALMOST DIDN'T HAPPEN. HERE IS WHAT -- YEAH THIS IS FOR REAL. SO CLEARLY I'M A KLUTZ. I HURT MY FINGER. I FELL, I HURT MY FINGER. AND SO I GET A THING FROM BONO AND THE EDGE. I GET A NICE E-MAIL FROM THOSE GUYS, TRYING TO CHEER ME UP, 'CAUSE THEY JUST FELL. BONO FELL. [ LAUGHTER ] BONO FELL ON HIS BIKE. AND HE BROKE HIS WRIST. AND HIS FACE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, THEN EDGE JUST FELL OFF THE STAGE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
Steve: FELL OFF THE EDGE OF THE STAGE.
Jimmy: THAT WAS CLASSIC, YEAH. EXACTLY, YEAH. ANYWAYS, THEY SENT ME A FUNNY E-MAIL. IT SAID, "WELL, WHILE WE'RE IN NEW YORK, WE WOULD LOVE IF YOU COME OUT AND DO A SONG OR SOMETHING." SO I TOOK HIM UP ON IT. THEY JUST WANTED TO CHEER ME UP. SO I GO, "GREAT." SO THEY DO THIS PART OF THE SHOW WHERE THEY -- IT'S AN AMAZING SHOW, BY THE WAY. GOSH, I CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. BUT IT DEFINITELY IT'S A GAME CHANGER. YOU SHOULD GO SEE THEM IF YOU CAN. THEY COME TO THIS LITTLE, TINY STAGE AT THE END OF -- THEY HAVE A GIANT STAGE AND A TINY STAGE AT THE END. THEY GO TO THE TINY STAGE, AND THEY PICK PEOPLE OUT OF THE AUDIENCE WITH SIGNS AND THEY HAVE THEM JUST STAND. COME UP ON THE STAGE, AND THEY TALK TO HIM AND THEY PLAY A A SONG WITH THE FANS. A FAN COULD PLAY GUITAR. SO I'M LIKE, "IT'S AMAZING." IT'S REALLY COOL. SO THEY GO, "WE GOTTA -- YOU HOLD UP THE SIGN, AND THEN WE'LL PICK YOU OUT OF THE AUDIENCE AND THEN YOU DO A SONG WITH THE BAND." I GO, "FANTASTIC." SO THEY SAID, "MAKE A SIGN THAT MAKES SENSE." I WRAP MY HAND EXTRA WRAPPED BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BANG INTO PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, 100,000, 300,000 PEOPLE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: I THINK A MILLION.
Jimmy: SO ANYWAYS, SO I MAKE A SIGN THAT SAYS, "SINGER WITH A BROKEN FINGER." SO I MAKE IT HERE IN THE OFFICE. SO I'M THERE. SO, I DIDN'T WANT TO -- I HAD THIS GIANT CAST. SO I DIDN'T WANT TO GO OUT TOO EARLY BECAUSE I HAVE A GIANT CAST AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE LOOKING AT ME LIKE, "WHO'S -- OH, YOU REALLY NEED ATTENTION THAT BAD?" [ LAUGHTER ] SO I WAITED BACK. I'M IN THE BACK AND I'M WATCHING THE CAMERA GUYS SWITCH. THERE'S SO MUCH WORK THAT GOES INTO THIS CONCERT. IT IS REALLY INSANE. I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. SO ANYWAYS. SECURITY GOES, " OKAY, THIS SONG GOES ON BEFORE YOUR SONG." "MYSTERIOUS WAYS." GREAT SO LET'S GO. THE SECURITY GRABS ME. THEY WHISK ME INTO THE THING. SO I GO ON THE SIDE -- THE AUDIENCE. SO, I'M IN THE CROWD. AND I PICK UP MY SIGN. I HOLD THE SIGN BUT I COVERED MY FACE. I DON'T WANT THEM TO SEE MY FACE. SO, I'M DOING THE SIGN. HERE'S ME HOLDING MY SIGN. THAT'S ME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ME THERE, RIGHT? SO ANYWAYS, I WENT TO REHEARSAL YESTERDAY, PROBABLY 2:00. WENT OVER TO MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, REHEARSED WITH THE BAND. AND WE FIGURED OUT THE WHOLE THING. SO, AS I'M THERE, BONO WAS JUST -- HE NEVER DOES BITS WITH COMEDIANS. HE'S JUST DOING BONO. FORGETS THAT I'M THERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FOR REAL. SO HE PICKS SOMEONE RANDOM OUT OF THE AUDIENCE AND THEY GO ON STAGE AND I'M LIKE, "UM, SINGER WITH A BROKEN FINGER. SINGER WITH A BROKEN FINGER."
