YEAH. UNFORTUNATELY.
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. ALSO, KIND OF IN A WEIRD WAY, IT'S JUST FASCINATING HOW NEWSPAPERS WORK AND HOW THE STORY JUST KIND OF OPENED UP A A CAN OF WORMS, REALLY.
YEAH, IT'S THE STORY OF -- IN "THE BOSTON GLOBE," IN 2001? TRYING TO REMEMBER THE DATES BECAUSE IT SPANNED SEVERAL YEARS. STARTED, THEY WERE AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM CALLED SPOTLIGHT, INSIDE "THE BOSTON GLOBE" NEWSPAPER. WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE A METRO SECTION OR LOCAL INVESTIGATIVE SECTION, HEADED BY THE PERSON I PLAY, WALTER "ROBBY" ROBINSON. GREAT GUY. AND THE TEAM WAS UNBELIEVABLY DOGGED. AND THEY WON A PULITZER PRIZE FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND THE UNCOVERING EXPOSITION OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF BOSTON FOR THE CHILD ABUSE SCANDALS, CARDINAL LAW. YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER ALL THAT.
Jimmy: I'M SURE, YEAH. -- CATHOLICS, YEAH.
REALLY, REALLY HORRIFIC. YEAH, YEAH. AND IT'S NOT ONLY NECESSARY TO TELL THE STORY. IT'S SO UNBELIEVABLY WELL DONE. THIS CAST THAT I'M WITH IS, ONCE AGAIN, ANOTHER ONE OF THESE GREAT CASTS THAT I'M PART OF. AND THE DIRECTION OF McCARTHY IS GREAT.
Jimmy: TOM McCARTHY. HE DID --
YEAH "WIN WIN", "THE STATION AGENT." YEAH. GREAT FAN. IT'S REALLY HANDLED GREAT. INTERESTINGLY WHEN, YOU KNOW. IT'S OBVIOUSLY A TOUGH SUBJECT, BUT WHEN YOU'RE DONE, IT'S, IN AN ODD WAY, KIND OF UPLIFTING. IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY MOVING. I MEAN, IT'S GETTING INSANELY GREAT REVIEWS.
Jimmy: IT'S EXCITING TO WATCH BECAUSE YOU SEE HOW ALMOST, THE STORY DIDN'T HAPPEN. HOW MANY TIMES IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. HOW MANY PEOPLE SAY YOU CAN'T SAY THIS. NOW IT'S TOO LATE.
AND HOW SYSTEMIC IT WAS AND HOW INVOLVED THE COVER-UP WAS. IT'S DEPRESSING UP TO A POINT, AND THEN IT BECOMES, LIKE I SAY, WEIRDLY. FIRST OF ALL, YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH REAL JOURNALISTS AND PEOPLE WHO DO THE HARD WORK. AND THESE GUYS ARE THE HEROES OF THE STORY YOU KNOW, ROBBY AND MIKE --
Jimmy: YOU GOT TO MEET THOSE GUYS?
YEAH. HANG OUT WITH --
Jimmy: DID YOU GET THE ACCENT FROM THEM?
YOU HAVE, LIKE, THE GREATEST EAR OF ALL EARS. IT'S UNCANNY HOW GOOD YOUR EAR IS FOR STUFF.
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
IT'S TRUE, BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S A TRICKY ONE, THAT ACCENT.
Jimmy: I DON'T MESS WITH THE BOSTON ACCENT.
IT CAN CHANGE FROM NEIGHBORHOOD TO NEIGHBORHOOD. IT CAN CHANGE FROM BLOCK TO BLOCK.
Jimmy: SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN HAVE ACCENTS, AND SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE, WICKED PISSER! HEY, FALLON! OH, MY GOSH. I THOUGHT YOU DID THAT IN A A DRAMA THEY'D BE LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON?
EXACTLY. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. BECAUSE YOU'VE ACTED IN --
Jimmy: WELL, SOME PEOPLE MIGHT CALL IT ACTING.
WHEN YOU FOCUS TOO MUCH ON IT, THEN YOU KIND OF SCREW IT UP BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEW IT INTO THE CHARACTER AND THE STORY LIKE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. ROBBY, THE GUY I PLAYED, WALTER ROBINSON, HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE, REALLY. AND THEN WHEN YOU HANG OUT WITH HIM, YOU HEAR IT COME OUT IN CERTAIN WORDS. YOU KNOW, AND CERTAIN SENTENCES. DEPENDING UPON WHOM HE'S SPEAKING TO -- WITH WHOM HE'S SPEAKING.
Jimmy: YEAH. EXACTLY. IT'S WELL DONE. I WAS LIKE, THAT'S SUCH A A TRICKY THING, BUT YOU DID IT PERFECTLY.
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO SHOW A CLIP, IT'S SO GOOD. BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY NICK OFFERMAN IS IN MY NEXT MOVIE CALLED "THE FOUNDER." ABOUT THE GUY WHO -- ABOUT McDONALDS, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT SOMETIME, BUT HE'S GREAT IN THE MOVIE, TOO. I WANNA THROW A PLUG TO NICK.
Jimmy: HE'S A GOOD GUY.
HE'S BRINGING OUT MEAT TOO.
Jimmy: WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A A MEAT DEMO. NEXT TIME YOU COME ON, WE CAN DO THE WHOLE MEAT DEMO.

SOME OTHER TIME, JIM. WE HAVE COVER-UP STORIES ON 70 PRIESTS. THE BOSS ISN'T GONNA RUN IT UNLESS I GET CONFIRMATION FROM YOUR SIDE.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
COME ON. IT'S OUR TOWN, JIMMY. EVERYBODY KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING ON. AND NO ONE DID A THING. WE GOT TO PUT AN END TO IT.

IT IS, YEAH. IT'S REALLY EXCITING. JEFFREY HATCHER DID THIS INCREDIBLE ADAPTATION OF IT. WE'RE DOING IT IN BOSTON. IF IT GOES WELL, WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO SYRACUSE. AND THEY SAID IF IT GOES WELL THERE, MAYBE WESTCHESTER.

WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M PLAYING A VERY FAT MAN IN THIS PLAY.

SO, TO PUT ON THE WEIGHT, I HAVE A REGIMEN GOING OF SOME OF MY FAVORITE FATTY MEATS. I THOUGHT SOME OF YOUR VIEWERS COULD WORK THEM INTO THEIR OWN FALL SCHEDULE. I HAVE A THREE-PART PLAN LAID OUT.
Jimmy: OH, FANTASTIC.
FIRST, WE'LL TALK ABOUT TAILGATING. YOU KNOW, ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO IN FOOTBALL SEASON. I LOVE FLANNEL. MEGAN HAS THIS FLANNEL BIKINI THAT WILL MAKE YOUR HAT FLY OFF.

WHICH IS NEAR WISCONSIN.
Jimmy: THAT'S YOUR WHITER SAUSAGE.
YEAH, THAT'S A PORK DISH.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE THESE AGAIN?
WELL, THAT'S A SIDE DISH. GIVE ME SOME OF THE SIDE DISH. IF YOU WANT TO -- IF YOU WANT A A SALAD WITH YOUR BRATS, THESE ARE WISCONSIN CHEESE CURDS.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT A SALAD. THAT'S A CHEESE CURD. LLL AND WHAT BEVERAGE? YOU HAVE TWO BEVERAGES. THESE GO WELL WITH THE SAUSAGE?
IT'S CHILLY OUT, SO A HARDY BEER IS GOOD. I LIKE SOMETHING SMOKIER. THIS IS SINGLE MALT SCOTCH, WHICH IS LIKE A CAMPFIRE IN A A GLASS. CILANTRO.

NO, YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF THE TURDUCKEN.
Jimmy: IS THAT IT?
YEAH, IT'S A CHICKEN CARCASS INSERTED INTO A DUCK CARCASS.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
WHICH HAS BEEN SHOVED INSIDE A TURKEY.
Jimmy: TURKEY CARCASS. THE TURDUCKEN, YOU'LL FIND, IS A BIT LITTLE LIGHTWEIGHT. IT'S TASTY, BUT IT LEAVES ME WANTING. AND SO WE CREATED A DISH CALLED THE FLYING PIG. WHERE WE FEED A TURDUCKEN TO A A LARGE BLACK KENTUCKY PIG IN MID-AUGUST.
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
AND THEN YOU SLAUGHTER THE PIG FOR THANKSGIVING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SERVE TURDUCKEN-FED PORK. ALSO KNOWN AS THE FLYING PIG.
Jimmy: THE FLYING PIG, YEAH. NEVER HEARD OF THAT. THAT'S FANTASTIC.
IT'S A NUTTY, MEATY FLAVOR. WITH HINTS OF SHOE LEATHER AND MINK OIL. AND JUST A TOUCH OF REGRET.
Jimmy: OOH. A LITTLE REGRET. WHAT GOES WITH THAT? WHAT GOES WELL WITH THE FLYING PIG?
I LIKE A GLASS OF SINGLE MALT SCOTCH.
Jimmy: SEEMS LIKE THAT WAS THE LAST ONE.
MUD IN YOUR EYE.
Jimmy: THANKS. OH, MY GOSH. THAT WILL DEFINITELY -- THAT WILL FUEL UP YOUR BACKHOE.
THAT'LL PUT -- CHEEK AND JOWLS.
Jimmy: CHEEK AND JOWLS IN THAT ONE. BEFORE WE GO, THIS IS SOMETHING I HAD MADE. AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS THE GREATEST THING EVER. I HAD BREAD BAKED AROUND A A GIANT KIELBASA. I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T BE "THE TONIGHT SHOW" UNLESS WE TRIED TO LADY AND THE TRAMP THIS SUCKER. YOU LIKE MUSTARD ON YOURS?
