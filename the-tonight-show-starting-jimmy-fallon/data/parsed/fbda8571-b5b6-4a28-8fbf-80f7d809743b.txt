WE WERE THERE AT THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE, OF COURSE, AND WE -- WE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE PART OF THE CEREMONY AND I JUST -- HE WAS THINKING ABOUT RETIRING AT THAT TIME. YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO MUCH. TOO MUCH.

IT'S CALLED "AND THE MOVIES," NOT "AT THE MOVIES." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHY WE'RE REDOING IT THIS TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]

THANK YOU. THANK YOU, JIMMY. ROOTS, THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU GUYS A A STORY ABOUT HOW I QUIT SMOKING MARIJUANA. [ LAUGHTER ] ILLEGALLY. I GOT MY POT CARD. IN CALIFORNIA, WHERE I LIVE, THEY SAY IT'S SO EASY. YOU GO IN. YOU SAY YOU'VE GOT ANXIETY OR THAT YOUR BACK HURTS AND THEY JUST GIVE YOU A POT CARD. SO I WENT INSIDE AND I SAID I'VE GOT ANXIETY THAT MIGHT, MAYBE, SOMEDAY, MY BACK MIGHT HURT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE SAID, HERE YOU GO. LET'S CUT THAT OUT BEFORE IT STARTS. [ APPLAUSE ] FIVE MINUTES LATER, I'M IN A A WEED STORE. I'M WALKING OUT WITH A BAG OF WEED, THE LADY BEHIND THE COUNTER SAYS "HEY, BEFORE YOU GO. IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME, HERE'S A A FREE WEED BROWNIE." AND SHE GAVE ME A WEED BROWNIE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A VHS TAPE. NOW, I DON'T NORMALLY LIKE TO EAT WEED BROWNIES, BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TO FEEL LIKE I'M DYING ALL THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I LEARNED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YOU NEVER SAY NO TO DRUGS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I TOOK THE WEED BROWNIE -- YEAH, I DESERVED THAT. YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ] SO I TOOK THE WEED BROWNIE, AND I TOOK IT HOME AND I PUT IT INSIDE MY BACKPACK. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S ME BRAGGING, WE'VE ALL GOT BACKPACKS, I'M NOT BETTER THAN YOU GUYS. [ LAUGHTER ] PUT IN THE BACKPACK, AND JUST LEFT IT FOR THE DAY. LATER THAT NIGHT, TOOK THE NEW WEED THAT I GOT AND TOOK IT OVER TO MY NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE, SHARED IT WITH HIM. THEN WE WENT TO HIS BACKYARD AND PLAYED PINBALL LIKE RESPONSIBLE 34-YEAR-OLD MEN LIKE TO DO SOMETIMES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT NIGHT AROUND 11:30, MY PHONE RINGS AND IT'S MY WIFE. I ANSWER IT. AND ALL I CAN HEAR IS HER YELLING "WHAT'S IN YOUR BACKPACK? WHAT'S IN YOUR BACKPACK?" SILENCE. AND THEN SHE SAYS "WHATEVER'S IN YOUR BACKPACK, MIKEY ATE." MIKEY'S OUR 30-POUND FRENCH BULLDOG. SHE SAID, GET HOME AND I RAN HOME AND I GET -- SHE'S ALREADY GOT THE DOG IN THE CAR, I CAN SEE HER FROM THE OUTSIDE, THE ONLY WAY TO DESCRIBE THE LOOK ON HER FACE IS DIVORCE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I GET IN THE BACK OF THE CAR AND I SEE MIKEY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE ONLY WAY TO DESCRIBE HOW HIGH MIKEY IS BURNING MAN HIGH. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S LIKE A DOG THAT'S BEEN AT A FESTIVAL IN THE NEVADA DESERT FOR 14 DAYS AND HE JUST WANTS A A RIDE HOME. [ LAUGHTER ] IN FACT, HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HE'S A DOG ANYMORE. I GET IN THE CAR, SHE TAKES OFF, NOW I'M IN THE BACK SEAT WITH MY STONED BRO, AND IT FEELS LIKE THE BEGINNING OF LIKE A STONER BUDDY ADVENTURE. I FEEL LIKE I'M JAMES FRANCO, HE'S SETH ROGEN. WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, REALLY. WE GET TO THE VET, I GRAB MIKEY, AND I RUSH -- IT IS LIKE "BOYZ IN THE HOOD" AT THIS POINT, MY BEST FRIEND'S BEEN SHOT. AND I KICK THE DOOR OPEN. I KICK OPEN A DOOR AND ENTER VERY LOUDLY WITH MY STONED DOG INTO THE QUIET, SOMBER ROOM -- WAITING ROOM OF A 24-HOUR VET. AND PEOPLE ARE SITTING THERE WHOSE ANIMALS ARE DYING AND MY ANIMAL'S LIVING FOR THE FIRST TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT? WHAT DO YOU DO? I TELL YOU WHAT YOU DO IS YOU FILL OUT PAPERWORK. FIRST QUESTION ON THE PAPERWORK, WHAT'S YOUR DOG'S NAME? IT'S LIKE WHO CARES, HIS NAME'S DOG. SICK DOG. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S HIS BIRTHDATE? MAY 17, 1950, IT'S MY DAD'S BIRTHDAY. I DON'T KNOW THIS -- BIRTHDAY. ONLY THING I GOT RIGHT WAS MY NAME. EASY. THEN THEY COME OUT AND THEY TAKE US BACK INTO A ROOM. NOW WE'RE JUST IN A QUIET ROOM AT THE VET, ME AND MY WIFE AND MY DOG. YOU COULD CUT THE ANGER WITH THE MOST DULL SCISSORS YOU'VE EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE, SHE IS SO MAD AND IT'S JUST SILENT. AND THEN THE VET WALKS IN. AS SHE WALKS IN, THIS IS THE ORDER THAT IT HAPPENS, SHE FLIPS IT OPEN AND THE FIRST THING SHE SEES, SAYS OUT LOUD. "OH, NICK THUNE," LOOKS UP, REALIZES WE ARE IN FRONT OF HER AND REALIZES, OH, I'M SORRY, I'M A BIG FAN. SO, WHAT'S WRONG WITH DOG? [ LAUGHTER ] TWO HORRIBLE THINGS JUST HAPPENED FOR MY WIFE. ONE, THIS PERSON LIKES ME AND THINKS I'M A GOOD PERSON. TWO, I SAID THAT OUR DOG'S NAME IS DOG. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE REALIZES THE TENSION AND SAYS, SO HOW BIG WAS THE BROWNIE? AND I SAID, "STANDARD VHS." [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE SAID "DID HE EAT THE WHOLE THING? AND I SAID, "KNOWING HIM, HE PROBABLY PUT A LITTLE ASIDE FOR LATER." BECAUSE SHE'S A FAN AND SHE WANTED ME TO SAY THAT, AND I SAW A HOLE AND I TOOK IT. AND SHE LAUGHED OUT LOUD, BECAUSE SHE SHOULD HAVE. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE SHE DESERVED IT. NEXT THING I KNOW, MY WIFE THROWS THE CAR KEYS AT ME AND SAYS "GO WAIT IN THE CAR." [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH I THINK YOU CAN INTERPRET AS HER BEING ANGRY WITH ME OR HER SAYING "HEY, YOU'RE DOING A A GREAT JOB IN HERE, TAKE A A 15-MINUTE BREAK." [ LAUGHTER ] MIKEY GOT SOBER TWO DAYS LATER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE'S BEEN SOBER FOR A YEAR. HE'S ACTUALLY SPONSORING TWO DOGS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR ABOUT MIKEY. NICK THUNE! NICK THUNE, EVERYBODY! YOU CAN SEE HIM ON THE NORTHWEST SUMMER TOUR '14. INFORMATION AND DATES ARE ON HIS WEBSITE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
