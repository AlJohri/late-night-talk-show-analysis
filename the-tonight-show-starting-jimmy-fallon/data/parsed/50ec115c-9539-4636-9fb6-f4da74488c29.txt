OH, THAT WAS FANTASTIC. I'M THINKING OF RELEASING A A CHRISTMAS ALBUM NOW, BASED ON THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, REALLY. DID YOU KNOW KINDA WHAT -- HOW THAT WAS GOING TO TURN OUT OR WHEN YOU WERE DOING THAT?
I DIDN'T. BUT IT WAS A SPECIAL EXPERIENCE. AS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO THIS BY YOURSELF. AND THEN, THEY BRING IN OTHER PEOPLE. AND THEN, IT BECOMES LIKE A A CHORUS FULL OF PEOPLE. BUT YEAH. THAT WAS STRANGE. BUT I ENJOYED MYSELF.

Jimmy: SMART.
IN MY DEFENSE I TOLD HIM THAT -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT A DIRECTOR THINKING THAT YOU'VE GOT ALL THE FREE TIME IN THE WORLD. YOU WANT HIM TO THINK, YOU KNOW, THAT YOU'RE UP TO STUFF.

THIS IS WHAT'S SO FUNNY. THEY SHOWED LIKE, A LOT OF RESPECT AND ATTENTION. BUT I TOOK THEM TO THE LONDON PREMIERE. AFTER THE PREMIERE, THEY WERE JUST LIKE, "YO JOHN, I NEVER KNEW YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE FOR SO LONG. I THOUGHT YOU WERE AN EXTRA." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY THOUGHT YOU WERE AN EXTRA IN "STAR WARS." YEAH.
