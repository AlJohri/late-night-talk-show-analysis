Jimmy: EXCITED. I LOVE IT. OH, HEY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYBODY, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, YOU MADE IT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. I'M YOUR HOST JIMMY FALLON. YOU GUYS, WE HAVE A SUPER BOWL CHAMPION, PEYTON MANNING, ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THIS IS COOL BECAUSE OF ALL THE PRODUCTS HE'LL BE MENTIONING IN HIS INTERVIEW. [ LAUGHTER ] WE DON'T HAVE TO RUN ANY COMMERCIALS TONIGHT.
Steve: YAY!
Jimmy: NO COMMERCIALS, ISN'T THAT GREAT? [ CHEERS ] SO EXCITED. PEYTON MANNING IS ON THE SHOW TONIGHT FRESH OFF HIS SUPER BOWL VICTORY. GIVE IT UP FOR PEYTON MANNING.
Steve: COME ON! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Steve: AW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GUYS, OF COURSE, THE BIG NEWS IS THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARIES, WHICH WERE HELD LAST NIGHT, AND I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO BERNIE SANDERS AND DONALD TRUMP ON WINNING FOR EACH OF THEIR PARTIES. [ APPLAUSE ] IN HIS SPEECH BERNIE SAID HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, WHILE TRUMP WAS LIKE, "THIS WAS ALL ME. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] YOU LOSERS DID NOTHING."
Jimmy: AND WE STILL HAVE JEB BUSH, WHO'S FIGHTING TO STAY IN THE RACE. PEOPLE SAY JEB MAY BE FINALLY HITTING HIS STRIDE. IN FACT, ONE REPORTER SAID THAT JEB WAS GETTING, QUOTE, "VERY LOOSE, AND WHEN HE'S LOOSE, HE'S ON FIRE." [ LAUGHTER ] JEB SAID HE KNOWS PEOPLE WANT TO SEE HIM GET LOOSE BECAUSE THE CROWD IS ALWAYS YELLING "LOOSER, LOOSER, LOOSER."
Steve: NO! [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: LOOSER, YOU'RE -- ONE OF THE BIG SURPRISES LAST NIGHT WAS OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH WHO CAME IN SECOND FOR THE REPUBLICANS. SOME CELEBRITIES ARE EVEN STARTING TO SUPPORT HIM, EVEN ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. HOWEVER A SPOKESMAN FOR SCHWARZENEGGER SAID IT'S NOT AN ACTUAL ENDORSEMENT. WHEN ASKED WHY, SCHWARZENEGGER WAS LIKE, "BECAUSE EVEN I'M AFRAID OF HILLARY." [ LAUGHTER ] "YOU VOTE HOW YOU WANT. I WANT TO LIVE." BUT SCHWARZENEGGER DOES REALLY SEEM INTO JOHN KASICH. IN FACT AT ONE POINT HE EVEN TOLD KASICH, "YOU ARE THE TERMINATOR." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED, BUT KASICH IS ACTUALLY A LOT CLOSER TO BEING THE TERMINATOR THAN ANY OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES. LET'S SEE HOW THEY STACK UP. FIRST, FOR THE TERMINATOR, "HASTA LA VISTA, BABY" IS HIS CATCHPHRASE. FOR DONALD TRUMP "HASTA LA VISTA, BABIES" IS HIS IMMIGRATION PLAN. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SEE -- YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? THEY'RE --
Steve: YEAH. COMPARING HIM TO THE TERMINATOR.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, NEXT, THE TERMINATOR WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO ACCOMPLISH HIS MISSION. BEN CARSON WILL STOP AT NOTHING IN THE MIDDLE OF A HALLWAY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "COME OUT? NO? COME OUT? NO. NO." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NEXT, THE TERMINATOR IS BEFRIENDED BY HUMAN COMPANIONS. TED CRUZ WISHES HE KNEW WHAT THAT FELT LIKE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO, THAT'S SAD.
Steve: THAT'S SAD.
Jimmy: NO, I LIKE HIM, YEAH.
Steve: IT'S SAD.
Jimmy: I'M HIS FRIEND. AFTER THAT, THE TERMINATOR IS A A ROBOT FROM THE FUTURE HERE TO KILL JOHN CONNOR. MARCO RUBIO IS A ROBOT FROM THE PRESENT HERE TO KILL HIS CHANCES OF BEING PRESIDENT.
Steve: OH, WOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "I HOPE YOU HAVE A A GREAT DAY. I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY." FINALLY, THE TERMINATOR IS DEFEATED BY A GUY FROM THE YEAR 2029. HILLARY CLINTON IS DEFEATED BY A GUY FROM THE YEAR 1929.
YEAH!
Jimmy: THERE WE GO. [ APPLAUSE ] AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER, BERNIE SANDERS WON THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY LAST NIGHT. IT'S A BIG DEAL. BUT PEOPLE STILL SEEM TO HAVING -- HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING HIS NAME. WATCH THIS.
AND THE PROBLEM IS THE DEBATES BETWEEN HER AND BARRY SANDERS HAS BEEN --
FOX HAS PREDICTED THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE BERNIE SANDALS -- SANDERS. SANDALS. [ LAUGHTER ]
EVEN BOTH TRUMP'S PARTICULARLY CLOSING MESSAGE AND RAILING AGAINST PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND THE LIKE. AND BERNIE SANDWICHES -- BERNIE SANDERS HAS FROM THE BEGINNING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

AND AFTER THE POLLS CLOSED, HE GATHERED WITH HIS SUPPORTERS AND DID A VICTORY SPEECH. THIS SEEMED LIKE HE WAS PRETTY EXCITED. CHECK THIS OUT. [ CHEERS ]
ENOUGH, ENOUGH! ENOUGH WITH THE CLAPPING AND ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. GOOD EVENING. I'M BERNIE SANDERS, AND THIS MICROPHONE ISN'T EVEN ON. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO START BY SAYING I HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO REACH OUT TO REPUBLICANS TO MAKE THIS A A POSITIVE CAMPAIGN. IN FACT, I EVEN ASKED MARCO RUBIO TO HELP ME WITH MY SPEECH TONIGHT, BUT HE JUST HANDED ME A PIECE OF PAPER WITH THE WORDS "GOOD EVENING" WRITTEN ON IT 800 TIME. HE'S LOSING IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE. NOR ANYWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M SPEAKING TONIGHT TO CLAIM VICTORY IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY OVER SHE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ENOUGH! THAT'S TOO LOUD! NOW, OF COURSE, I HAVE TO THANK THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. I SAW -- I SAW THOUSANDS -- I SAW THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COME OUT FOR MY SUPPORT. FROM THE SHORES OF LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE TO THE WOODS OF LEMPSTER. FROM FITZWILLIAM TO HANCOCK, EFFINGHAM TO DIXVILLE NOTCH, NEW HAMPSHIRITES SHOWED THE WORLD THAT YOU ARE GOOD, DECENT PEOPLE, EVEN THOUGH YOU LIVE IN TOWNS THAT SOUND LIKE 18th CENTURY PORN STARS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU HAVE SPOKEN AND YOUR MESSAGE IS LOUD AND CLEAR. YOU WANT THE CANDIDATE WHO LOOKS LIKE A SCOOBY-DOO VILLAIN BEFORE HIS MASK IS REMOVED. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, THE POINT IS WE WON. AND I FEEL LIKE A MILLION BUCKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ENOUGH! STOP WITH THE CLAPPING AND THE LOUD. STOP, PLEASE! A MILLION BUCKS, WHICH, OF COURSE, MEANS I WILL NOW EVENLY DISTRIBUTE MYSELF AMONG THE MIDDLE CLASS.
