CRAZY.
Jimmy: THE MOST INCREDIBLE MOVIES OF MY LIFETIME.
THE WHOLE TIME FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, BEFORE WE EVEN SHOT, I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH, PROBABLY MY FAVORITE MEMORY OF THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE IS WHEN WE WERE PLANNING IT, WHEN YOU GUYS CAME TO VISIT ME ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD. AND REMEMBER WHEN WE WENT TO PAY OUR RESPECTS TO JOHN BELUSHI.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
THAT NIGHT WAS ONE OF THE MOST -- THAT'S A NIGHT I WILL NEVER FORGET. IT WAS A MAGICAL NIGHT. WE WENT THERE AND JUST HONORED HIM.
Jimmy: I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT. I WAS LIKE, PLEASE, I WANT TO GO.
Drew: AND THAT TREE. AND THE MOONLIGHT.
IT WAS GORGEOUS.
Jimmy: IT WAS JUST MAGICAL AND THEN WE --
I DIDN'T GET INVITED. WAS IT NICE?
Jimmy: NO IT WAS -- [ LAUGHTER ]
WHERE WERE YOU?
Jimmy: WE DIDN'T EVEN TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT. I REMEMBER --
Drew: MAYBE CAUSE WE WERE STAYING AT PETER'S HOUSE. WE STAYED IN APPLE AND BOB'S ROOMS, REMEMBER.
Jimmy: THE TINY LITTLE BEDS, IT WAS PERFECT. YEAH, IT WAS AWESOME.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE KIDS IN THERE WITH YOU.
Jimmy: THAT WAS A MISTAKE.
THE KIDS ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THAT.
Jimmy: TELL THEIR THERAPISTS OVER THAT. I REMEMBER GOING OUT THERE, THE LAST SCENE, I GO, "WHAT DO WE DO?" BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO DISRUPT THE GAME. YOU GO WE ACTUALLY USED THE CAMERAS FROM THE ACTUAL WORLD SERIES TO SHOOT THE ENDING OF THE FILM. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A CREW THERE WITH US.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND SO THEY WERE LIKE, "YEAH, JUST GO OUT, AND JUST DON'T BE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE WHEN THEY WIN THE WORLD SERIES." I GO, "OH, YEAH, WE WON'T DO THAT." I GO, "BUT, SHOULD I RUN ON THE FIELD?" YOU GO, "DO WHATEVER A FAN WOULD DO." I GO, "OKAY." SO THEY WON, AND I GO, "LET'S JUST DO IT." WE RAN OUT IN THE FIELD AND PEOPLE JUST LET US. IT WAS LIKE, WAIT, WHAT? WE JUST KEPT RUNNING OUT. AND THEN I'M LIKE, "DON'T BE ON CAMERA, BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN THE MOMENT WITH THE BOSTON RED SOX HAVE THE DVD COME OUT AND WE'RE HUGGING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD.
THE CAMERA GUY GOT INTO IT AND DID LIKE A 360 OF US KISSING ON THE FIELD AS IF HE WAS A BRILLIANT CINEMATOGRAPHER AND LIKE ENDED OUR MOVIE.
Jimmy: AND IT WAS AMAZING. HE WENT FOR IT YEAH. AND -- THEY ACTUALLY -- BUT THEN, ON TV THEY ACTUALLY DID CUT TO US KISSING ON THE FIELD. LIKE WE WERE IN OUR CHARACTERS. AND I REMEMBER ALL THE PLAYERS WERE COMING OUT GOING, "JIMMY, WE WON!" I'M LIKE, "NOT JIMMY, MY CHARACTER BEN RIGHT? AND WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M IN --
BY THE WAY, MY SON WAS FIVE AT THE TIME. AND I WANTED HIM TO BE THERE. WHEN YOU RAN ON THE FIELD I SAID, "GO ON THE FIELD," HE HAD A FRIEND OF HIS WHO WAS 5, CHARLIE THOMAS. I SAID, "GO ON THE FIELD BUT DON'T GO NEAR THE PITCHER'S MOUND. STAY AWAY." I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GET MOBBED. SO THEY RAN OUT INTO THE OUTFIELD. AT SOME POINT EVERYBODY'S ON THE MOUND CHEERING. AND I LOOKED OUT IN CENTER FIELD, THEY WERE PEEING AGAINST THE WALL. [ LAUGHTER ] DEAD SERIOUS.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T TELL KIDS WHAT TO DO.
5-YEAR-OLDS, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ZIPPERS, SO THEY HAD THE PANTS DOWN TO THE ANKLES. [ LAUGHTER ] SERIOUSLY.
Jimmy: THEY'RE THE BEST. I LOVE YOUR KIDS. THAT WAS FUN.
HYGIENIC.
Jimmy: GUYS, "DUMB AND DUMBER TO," THANK GOODNESS IT'S HERE. I MEAN -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAD THE BOYS ON. IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL, WHICH I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE JUST WORSHIP THE ORIGINAL, BUT GOSH THERE'S ARE SO MANY EASTER EGGS IN THIS MOVIE, I DON'T WANT TO RUIN ANYTHING. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH, WE CAN RUIN SOME THINGS.
THANKS.
Jimmy: BILLY, THE BLIND BOY. OH, MY GOSH. HE'S BACK, YOU GUYS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S THE SAME ACTOR.
YEAH. BRADY BLUHM. AND THEN WE HAVE FREDA FELCHER WHO IS --
YOU NEVER SAW THE FREDA FELCHER IN THE ORIGINAL. BUT WE GOT THE VERY BRAVE KATHLEEN TURNER TO PLAY HER IN THIS MOVIE.
Jimmy: SHE'S PHENOMENAL.
WE HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR HER. AND SHE'S JUST FEARLESS. SHE WAS THE PERFECT --
Jimmy: DID YOU PICTURE HER IN THE ROLE?
WE ACTUALLY WROTE IT -- WHEN WE WROTE THE SCRIPT IN PARENTHESES IT SAID A A DRESSED-DOWN KATHLEEN TURNER. CAUSE WE REALLY TOOK THIS WOMAN DOWN AND SHE HAD SUCH A GREAT ATTITUDE ABOUT -- LOOK, WE WORKED WITH GWYNETH AND CAMERON AND RENEE ZELLWEGER AND DREW. AND -- YOU KNOW, ALL OF THEM. AND CHER. YOU KNOW, CHER IS LIKE -- BUT KATHLEEN TURNER, SHE'S LIKE A A TRUE OLD-TIME MOVIE STAR. AND IT WAS AN HONOR TO WORK WITH HER. SHE WAS FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: AND IF YOU WATCH THE MOVIE, SEE IF YOU CAN FIND IF OR WHEN BILL MURRAY IS IN THE MOVIE.
IT'S A WHERE'S WALDO MOMENT WITH BILL MURRAY, THAT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW HOW OR MAYBE HE'S NOT IN THE MOVIE. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] IT'S REALLY FUN, IT'S GREAT. AND I GOT -- IS IT A SPOILER TO SAY WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE CREDITS?
NO, GO AHEAD.
Jimmy: SEA BASS RETURNS. "KICK HIS ASS SEABASS."
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE APPLAUSE.
Jimmy: NO. I THOUGHT I JUST RUINED THAT FOR YOU -- NO, NO -- [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] BUT DUDE, EVERYONE'S BACK. THE MUTT CUTT'S VAN IS BACK.
CAM NEALY'S BACK.
Jimmy: CAM NEALY'S BACK.
YOU HAVE TO STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS.
Jimmy: AND AT THE END OF THE CREDITS, STAY TUNED. GOSH, IT'S FUNNY.
Jimmy: WHEN JEFF WAS HERE AND HE WAS LIKE, WHEN HE FIRST SAID THE MOVIE, HIS AGENT SAID, "DON'T DO THIS MOVIE." THEY TRIED TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT. YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL SERIOUS ACTOR. YOU GOT CHOPS. DO NOT DO THIS COMEDY.
RIGHT.
AND THE STUDIO DIDN'T WANT HIM. BUT JIM WANTED HIM, AND WE WANTED HIM. AND THEY'D OFFERED THE ORIGINAL MOVIE, JIM GOT $7 MILLION, WHICH WAS THE MOST ANY COMEDIC ACTOR AHD EVER BEEN PAID. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT JEFF, THEY OFFERED HIM 50 GRAND, AND HE TOOK IT. HE SAID, "YEAH, I'M IN."
Jimmy: NO, HE DID NOT.
YEAH, HE DID. HE DIDN'T EVEN NEGOTIATE.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
HE LIVES OUT IN MICHIGAN. HE RENEGOTIATED AND ENDED UP GETTING 70 GRAND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
OUT IN MICHIGAN, THAT'S EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: EXACTLY, YEAH, HE LIKE LIVES IN A CAVE OR SOMETHING SOMEWHERE YEAH.
HE JUST WANTED TO DO A A MOVIE. AND WE WERE SO GRATEFUL BECAUSE HE PUSHES JIM IN WAYS THAT NOBODY CAN PUSH JIM.
Jimmy: IT'S SO FUN AND GREAT AND I WANT TO SHOW THE CLIP HERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT --
THIS IS WHEN THEY FIRST MEET FREDA FELCHER AFTER 25 YEARS. THEY HAVE NOT SEEN HER, AND THEY'RE TRACKING HER DOWN.
Jimmy: AND SHE WAS LIKE THE HOTTEST THING. SO HERE YOU GO. THE FARRELLY BROTHERS' NEW FILM "DUMB AND DUMBER TO." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

OH, SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION. WE MET YOUR SMOKING HOT DAUGHTER FREDA JR.
