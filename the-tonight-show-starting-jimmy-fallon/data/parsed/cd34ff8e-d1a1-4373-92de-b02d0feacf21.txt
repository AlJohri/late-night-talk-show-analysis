YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK AFTER OUR TWO-WEEK BREAK. IN FACT, I WAS SO EXCITED I WENT AROUND THE OFFICE GIVING EVERYONE I SAW A HIGH-FOUR. AND IT WAS REALLY EXCITING. [ APPLAUSE ] AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL BY THE CAST I'M WEARING I HAD A BIT OF A MISHAP RIGHT BEFORE WE WENT ON VACATION. LET ME JUST SAY YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY. THE OTHER GUY IS A GLASS TABLE, AND HE'S DEAD NOW. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE, YOU GUYS. I'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER. TODAY SCOTT WALKER ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, MAKING HIM THE 15th REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE TO ENTER THE RACE, WHICH I THINK MEANS WE GET THE 16th ONE FOR FREE. I HAVE A PUNCH CARD.
Steve: YOU'VE GOT A CARD.
Jimmy: YEAH, A PUNCH CARD. SCOTT WALKER IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, AS MANY REPUBLICANS PUT IT, YOU HAD ME AT WALKER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I SAW THAT WALKER'S CAMPAIGN SLOGAN IS "REFORM, GROWTH, SAFETY." WHICH IS ACTUALLY SIMILAR TO DONALD TRUMP'S NEW SLOGAN, "MEXICO, MONEY, CRAZY." AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING. IT'S VERY SIMILAR. THERE'S SO MANY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK. SO, HERE IS A QUICK HEAD COUNT FROM THE CANDIDATES THEMSELVES.
ONE.
TWO.
THREE.
FOUR.
FIVE.
SIX.
SEVEN.
EIGHT.
TEN.
55, 56. SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE.
8,737,545.
Jimmy: THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT. THAT MAKES SENSE. AND DURING OUR BREAK, CHRIS CHRISTIE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. YEAH. HE MADE THE SPEECH FROM LIVINGSTON HIGH SCHOOL IN NEW JERSEY WHERE HE WAS ACTUALLY CLASS PRESIDENT. AND CHECK OUT HIS YEARBOOK PHOTO HERE. LOOKING GOOD, EH? HE'S A STUD. YEAH, CHRIS CHRISTIE. HERE'S THE BEST PART, THOUGH. CHECK OUT WHAT HE WROTE IN THE YEARBOOK. THESE ARE ACTUAL WORDS HERE. HE SAID, "MANY SUPER HIGH SCHOOL DAYS. ALWAYS REMEMBER MY MAN SCOTT, STEVE S., TROY, RICK, HARRY, JULES AND FAT JACK." [ LAUGHTER ] CHRIS CHRISTIE HAD A FRIEND HE CALLED FAT JACK. OR AS CHRISTIE NOW CALLS HIM, REGULAR-SIZED JACK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FAT JACK. HEY, I READ THAT THE NATION'S THIRD LARGEST LABOR UNION, THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS, HAS OFFICIALLY ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT. THAT'S THE FIRST ENDORSEMENT BY A LABOR UNION FOR THE 2016 ELECTION. HERE'S THE TEACHERS UNION OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT. "WE THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS ARE VERY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENT. BUT WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WAITING UNTIL EVERYONE SETTLES DOWN. GUYS, YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME, NOT MINE. DO YOU WANT RECESS TODAY? I SUGGEST YOU ALL SETTLE DOWN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BRITTANY K., SIT IN YOUR DESK! I'M DEALING WITH A LOT OF PERSONAL STUFF AT HOME RIGHT NOW, AND THIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT HELPING. COME ON. WHO THREW THIS ERASER AT ME? I WILL THROW IT RIGHT BACK AT YOU! SCREW IT, LET'S JUST WATCH 'GLORY' AGAIN. VOTE HILLARY 2016." THAT'S WHAT TEACHERS SAID. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, I WANT TO TAKE A NAP. SOME CELEBRITY NEWS, ARIANA GRANDE ISSUED MULTIPLE APOLOGIES AFTER SHE WAS CAUGHT LICKING DOUGHNUTS AT A SHOP IN CALIFORNIA AND SAYING SHE HATES AMERICA, WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE WAY TO SHOW YOU LOVE AMERICA IT'S PROBABLY TO LICK A BUNCH OF DOUGHNUTS. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO. DID YOU SEE THE VIDEO?
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: I FEEL BAD FOR HER. WHO CARES? SHE LICKED SOME DOUGHNUTS.
Steve: YEAH, SHE LICKED SOME DOUGHNUTS.
Jimmy: DON'T HAVE THEM UP ON THE COUNTER. PUT THEM BEHIND --
Steve: IF YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE LICKING THEM.
Jimmy: I LOVE DOUGHNUTS. IF I SEE A DOUGHNUT I HAVE TO LICK IT. IF I SEE A DOUGHNUT. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] KIDS HAVING FUN. THEY GET BUSTED, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY, MAN.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM BEHIND PLASTIC.
Steve: YEAH, THAT'S WHY THERE WHOLE -- IT'S CALLED A A GUARD. IT'S CALLED A DON'T LICK GUARD.
Jimmy: DID YOU SEE THIS? McDONALD'S IS UNDER FIRE NOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR NEW "MINION" HAPPY MEAL TOYS. DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? APPARENTLY, THE PARENTS ARE SAYING THAT THE TOYS SOUND LIKE THEY'RE CURSING WHEN YOU SQUEEZE THEM OR SOMETHING. CHECK THIS OUT.
Steve: SHUT THE FLOCK?
Jimmy: YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHAT THE?
Steve: OH, WHAT THE?
Jimmy: WHAT THE FLECK? YEAH. SO, THAT'S THE THING RIGHT THERE. SO, THEY'RE IN TROUBLE. THEN SUBWAY SAID, YEAH, THAT IS DEFINITELY THE FAST FOOD SCANDAL WE SHOULD ALL BE TALKING ABOUT, THOSE CURSING MINIONS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE -- GET ON THAT. LET'S FOCUS ON THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GUYS, I READ THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY WENT SKINNY DIPPING THIS WEEKEND IN AN ATTEMPT TO BREAK THE 2009 WORLD RECORD OF 13,648 SKINNY-DIPPERS. THEN THE SHARKS WERE LIKE, COOL, THEY ALREADY TOOK THE WRAPPERS OFF THESE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, WHILE HE WAS IN BOLIVIA LAST WEEK, POPE FRANCES STOPPED AT A BURGER KING TO CHANGE HIS CLOTHES BEFORE MASS. I'M NO EXPERT, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT'S THE BEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN A A BURGER KING BATHROOM IN BOLIVIA. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! HEY, I LOVE YOU GUYS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: HEY! I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I AM TO BE BACK AND SEEING YOU GUYS ARE HERE. WHAT A CRAZY BREAK WE HAD. TWO-WEEK BREAK.
Steve: TWO WEEKS.
Jimmy: YEAH, SO BASICALLY, WHAT HAPPENED IS I TRIPPED AND FELL IN MY KITCHEN, ON A A BRAIDED RUG THAT MY WIFE LOVES AND I CAN'T WAIT TO BURN IT TO THE GROUND. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I TRIPPED AND FELL AND I CAUGHT MY FALL AND I JUST -- SO I'M GETTING UP AND MY FINGER IS SIDEWAYS. SO I GO, OH, MY GOD, DID I JUST BREAK MY FINGER? THIS IS THE LAMEST THING IN THE WORLD. LIKE COMPLETELY LOOKS FAKE. IT LOOKED FAKE LIKE A CHEAP HORROR MOVIE WHERE YOU SEE LIKE A BROKEN FINGER. IT LOOKED LIKE THAT. THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. SO I GO -- I WRAPPED MY HAND IN A TOWEL AND I GET IN THE CAB TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. I GO, "I BROKE MY FINGER. I THINK I BROKE MY FINGER." THEY LOOK AND THEY GO, "OH, YOU DIDN'T BREAK YOUR FINGER. IT'S A THING CALLED RING AVULSION." A-V-U-L-S-I-O-N. IF YOU GOOGLE IT, GRAPHIC IMAGES.
Steve: DON'T GOOGLE IT, TRUST ME.
Jimmy: DON'T GOOGLE IT. BUT RING AVULSION. IT'S A REAL THING. SO, BASICALLY, WHAT IT IS, MY RING GOT CAUGHT ON THE COUNTERTOP WHEN I WAS GOING DOWN AND STUCK THERE AND PULLED MY FINGER OUT. TRUST ME. I'M LIKE, "WAIT WHAT?" I DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT THE THING ONCE I -- I GO, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?" I GO, "CAN YOU FIX IT?" AND THEY GO, "NO, WE HAVE TO SEND YOU SOMEWHERE ELSE." OH, REALLY? THEY GO, "THIS IS LIKE MICROSURGERY." IT'S LIKE A THING. SO, I HAD TO GO TO -- I WAS AT BETH ISRAEL. I WENT OVER TO BELLEVUE HOSPITAL, THIS AMAZING DOCTOR, DR. DAVID CHIU. DR. CHIU WAS HIS NAME. AWESOME DOCTOR, COMES IN. HE HAS A BOW TIE AND COWBOY BOOTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHERE DO I SIGN?
Jimmy: THAT'S MY DOCTOR. THAT'S MY GUY. I KNEW WHEN HE WALKED IN. HE'S GOING TO SAVE MY FINGER. APPARENTLY THE ODDS AREN'T GREAT WITH THESE THINGS. IT HAPPENS A LOT. AND THE ODDS ARE -- USUALLY THEY'RE JUST GOING TO CUT YOUR FINGER OFF. SO I WAS GOING TO LOSE MY FINGER. I WAS LIKE, WOW. SO THIS GUY DID SURGERY FOR LIKE SIX HOURS. MICROSURGERY, SO IT'S UNDER A A MICROSCOPE. HE HAD TO TAKE A VEIN OUT OF MY FOOT. IT'S A CRAZY STORY. I GO, YOU'VE GOT TO BE -- I DIDN'T KNOW THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE I'M KNOCKED OUT AT THIS POINT. SO HE TOOK A VEIN OUT OF MY FOOT AND PUT IT IN THERE. AND IF YOU ATTACHED IT -- AND VEINS ONLY WORK ONE WAY, THEY GO THIS WAY OR THAT WAY. SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE -- YOU'RE SO HAPPY I'M NOT YOUR DOCTOR. VEINS GO THIS WAY OR THAT WAY.
Steve: THIS ONE'S GOING THE WRONG WAY.
Jimmy: GET THIS GUY AWAY FROM ME. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHICH WAY AND YOU HAVE TO REVERSE IT AND MAKE SURE, AND THEN IF YOU -- WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING IT TOGETHER, IF YOU DO ONE MISSTITCH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THE VEIN CLOSES UP AND IT'S USELESS. AND YOU SCREWED UP AND IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. AND HE DID IT, AND HE SAVED MY FINGER. AND NOW YOU CAN SEE IT'S PINK ON THE END. IT WAS WHITE LIKE THIS COLOR. AND SO HE SAVED MY FINGER. I WON'T GET FEELING BACK FOR EIGHT WEEKS HE SAID. I WAS IN THE ICU FOR TEN DAYS. AND I'VE GOT TO SAY THE NURSES AND DOCTORS AT BELLEVUE HOSPITAL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING CARE OF ME. OH, MY GOSH, I LOVE YOU GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TOUGH JOB. IT'S A TOUGH, TOUGH JOB. YOU GUYS ARE ROCK STARS AND JUST AWESOME, AWESOME PEOPLE. DR. REIS, TOO, IS GREAT, DR. PATEL, DR. WOLF, TOO. I STARTED LOSING IT HALFWAY THROUGH BECAUSE YOU JUST SIT THERE. YOU SIT THERE. YOU'RE IN A A ROOM, AND I JUST -- I STARTED READING BOOKS ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] I DID.
Steve: WHAT ELSE ARE GO YOU GOING TO DO?
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. I ALWAYS WANTED TO READ THAT. I JUST NEVER HAD THE TIME TO READ THAT. THIS IS THE BOOK I READ, BUT I HAD THE KINDLE VERSION. BUT, THIS IS IT "MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING," VIKTOR FRANKL. I READ THIS BOOK.
Steve: AND YOU LOVED IT.
Jimmy: I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. I HIGHLIGHTED THINGS IN IT. HONESTLY, I KNOW THE MEANING OF LIFE NOW IF EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW. WE'LL HAVE A DRINK LATER, I'LL TELL YOU ALL THAT. NOT AS DIFFICULT AS YOU THINK. AND IT'S AN INTERESTING BOOK. BUT, I READ THAT. I WATCHED A BUNCH OF MOVIES. I WATCHED "THE DUFF." HAVE YOU SEEN THAT MOVIE?
Steve: NO.
Jimmy: IT'S ON iTUNES. IT'S FANTASTIC MOVIE, "THE DUFF." IT'S LIKE THE NEW "MEAN GIRLS" TYPE OF THING. I LOVED IT. I WATCHED IT THREE TIMES. PEOPLE COME VISIT ME AND I GO, "HAVE YOU SEEN 'THE DUFF'?" I WATCHED THAT, I WATCHED "REAL HOUSEWIVES OF NEW YORK," I GOT THAT -- BUT, REALLY I WAS WATCHING TV AND I WAS READING THIS MEANING OF LIFE THING, AND I THOUGHT, THIS IS THE MEANING OF MY LIFE. I BELONG ON TV, AND I SHOULD BE TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING WHO ARE EITHER IN AN ICU OR WHEREVER YOU ARE, AT HOME. IF ANYONE IS SUFFERING AT ALL, THIS IS MY JOB. I'M HERE TO MAKE YOU LAUGH AND I WANT TO MAKE YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME. GET OUT OF THE HOSPITAL! GET OUT. I'M TELLING YOU YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE! LISTEN TO YOUR NURSES! THEY WILL GET YOU OUT. YEAH, JUST THAT'S MY JOB. SO THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO, I WANT TO SPREAD THE LOVE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE, ALL THE TWITTER COMMENTS AND -- SO THOUGHTFUL AND NICE OF EVERYBODY. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE COMEDIAN FRIENDS BECAUSE I GOT SO MANY STUPID E-MAILS THAT REALLY MADE ME LAUGH AND GOT ME THROUGH JUST SOME CRAZY DAYS, AND OF COURSE MY WIFE. I'VE GOT TO THANK HER, TOO, FOR COMING AND DOING ALL THAT. BUT THEN THE BEST E-MAIL IS I E-MAIL HIGGINS -- OR YOU E-MAIL ME. AND YOU GO, "HOW'S THE FINGER, DUDE?" I GO, "NOT GOOD. I JUST GOT OUT OF ICU. I'VE BEEN IN THERE FOR TEN DAYS." YOU GO, "WHAT? NO ONE TOLD ME." SO, I GO, "OH, YEAH DUDE. IT'S TERRIBLE. HOW IS YOUR BREAK? WHERE ARE YOU? HAVING FUN?" YOU GO, "DUDE, I'VE BEEN IN BED FOR SEVEN DAYS. I HAVE --"
Steve: LYME DISEASE. 103 FEVER. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TEST FOR LYME DISEASE. MY WIFE GOES, "NO, THEY'RE GONNA TEST YOU FOR LYME DISEASE." I GO, "THEY DON'T WANT TO."

Steve: DID YOU BUMBLE SOMETHING?
Jimmy: IT WAS A BUMBLE BECAUSE MY FOOT GOT CAUGHT IN THE RUG AND THEN I TRIED TO CATCH MY FALL. I KNOW IT MAKES EVERYONE LAUGH, BUT THE DOUBLE TRIP IS SO MUCH MORE FUNNY.
Steve: BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEAN.
Jimmy: I FEEL BAD FOR ANYONE WHO TRIPS.
Steve: YOU THINK YOU'RE CLEAN.
Jimmy: BUT IF IT WAS ME WATCHING ME, I WOULD LAUGH. I'D GO, "OH, THAT WAS GOOD."

OH, YEAH, HE SAW IT. HE ACTUALLY SAW THE MOVIE, THE FIRST MOVIE I'VE EVER DONE THAT HE'S EVER SEEN. [ LAUGHTER ] MOST OF THEM ARE NOT REALLY APPROPRIATE, I GUESS.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, NOT A LOT OF 9-YEAR-OLDS, YEAH, WATCHING YOUR MOVIES.
THERE WAS ONE OTHER -- THE ONLY TIME HE EVER SAW ME IN ANYTHING WAS IN A "RENO 911" THING WHERE I GOT -- I WAS FLIPPING AROUND AND I GOT -- MURDERED. I GOT SHOT, AND IT WAS BRUTAL. LIKE A LOT OF BLOOD EVERYWHERE, AND IT REALLY TRAUMATIZED HIM. SO HOPEFULLY, THIS WAS A NICE PALATE CLEANSER.
Jimmy: HAS HE BEEN SO EXCITED ALL SUMMER?
YES. HE WAS. HE CAME DOWN TO VISIT AND MY DAUGHTER, TOO. SHE'S 5. SHE'S A LITTLE TOO YOUNG. BUT THEY CAME TO VISIT. HE TRIED ON THE HELMET. THAT WAS REALLY LIKE, KIND OF A A BIG TURNING POINT, HE GOT TO PUT ON THE HELMET. I TOOK A PICTURE WITH HIM, AND IT'S SO FUNNY. BECAUSE I CAN TELL HE'S SO EXCITED AND HE'S SMILING REALLY BIG FOR THE PICTURE, BUT HE'S GOT THE MASK ON. YOU CAN'T SEE IT.
Jimmy: HE'S BORED OR HE'S IN DAFT PUNK.
ONE OF THE TWO. YEAH, GET LUCKY.
Jimmy: EXACTLY.
HE WAS VERY EXCITED.
Jimmy: DID YOU GEEK OUT ABOUT THAT, TOO? WHEN YOU WERE GETTING THE SUIT ON? WHAT DOES "ANT-MAN" -- WHAT DOES HE DO AND WHAT DOES HE WEAR?
OH TOTALLY. YEAH. IT'S THE COOLEST LOOKING SUIT. IT'S LIKE AN OLD VINTAGE MOTORCYCLE SUIT.
Jimmy: DO YOU MIND ACTING IN THAT SUIT? BECAUSE YOU SPENT HOURS IN THAT SUIT.
I LOVED IT. THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN'T FEEL KIND OF COOL IN THAT, BECAUSE IT'S JUST ALL LIKE DECKED OUT AND THERE'S LIGHTS IN IT AND -- IT'S COOL. IT'S GREAT.
Jimmy: MICHAEL DOUGLAS IS IN THIS FILM. HE'S A LEGENDARY ACTOR. MICHAEL DOUGLAS. HE PLAYS HANK PYM.
YEAH.
Jimmy: SO, HE CREATED THE "ANT-MAN" SUIT. AND YOU'RE DOING A SCENE OPPOSITE MICHAEL DOUGLAS, AND THIS IS A TRUE STORY. PLEASE TELL ME THE STORY, BECAUSE IT'S VERY FUNNY.
IT WAS HIS LAST DAY OF SHOOTING.
Jimmy: HOW IS HE, BY THE WAY?
HE'S THE COOLEST. I MEAN, HE'S GREAT, HE'S A A LEGEND. AND I -- AS GREAT AS HE IS, I COULDN'T NEVER, EVER SHAKE THE FACT THAT I WAS WORKING WITH MICHAEL DOUGLAS. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST -- IT'S INTIMIDATING. HE'S SO NICE, BUT I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO THINK THAT I COULDN'T BE MYSELF. AND I THOUGHT, I'M REALLY GOING TO TRY AND BE BUDDY BUDDY WITH THE GUY. AND IT WAS HIS LAST DAY, AND I THOUGHT, ALL RIGHT, WE'RE DOING A CLOSE-UP. I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO? I'M GOING TO "BASIC INSTINCT" HIM. AND WHEN HE'S SPEAKING, I'M GOING TO SIT IN A -- I'M SITTING IN A CHAIR CHAIR ACROSS FROM HIM, AND I'M GOING TO, YOU KNOW, JUST THE CLASSIC -- DO THAT. SO, NO I DIDN'T TELL HIM, I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. AND I GOT UP AND THEY'RE GETTING READY, AND I'M WEARING A T-SHIRT AND JEANS, SO I UNZIP MY PANTS AND I GET IT -- OVER AND OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO I HAD TO PULL MY SHIRT DOWN SO I WASN'T EXPOSED, YOU KNOW. THEN I FIGURE, I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN AND THEN WHEN THE SCENE STARTS, I'M GONNA LIFT MY SHIRT UP AND I'LL JUST BE LIKE THIS. AND THE ONE THING THAT I DIDN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IS THAT WHEN I SAT DOWN, THAT LIKE THE WAISTBAND OF MY BOXERS WAS JUST GOING TO KIND OF MUSH EVERYTHING, LIKE PUSH IT UP AND BACK IN.
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
SO I KNEW IT, YOU COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING, BECAUSE I WAS PULLING MY SHIRT DOWN TRYING TO GET IT OUT. AND HE'S DOING HIS LINES, NOT GIVING YOU NOTHING. JUST REALLY A TOTAL PRO.
Jimmy: WHAT IS HE SEEING?
I'M REALLY TRYING. I SHOULD HAVE JUST STOPPED, BUT I DIDN'T. SO I'M LIKE THIS. IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS BASICALLY PLEASURING MYSELF TO MICHAEL DOUGLAS GIVING A A MONOLOGUE. AND I'M COVERING IT. THEN HE'S JUST -- HE JUST STOPPED, AND HE JUST LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, "WHAT, ARE YOU A A [ EXPLETIVE ] PERVERT?" NO SMILES, NO -- I WAS LIKE, "OH, I'M SO SORRY." I WAS TRYING TO "BASIC INSTINCT" YOU.
Jimmy: HE'S REALLY A BIG FAN OF YOURS.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT, AND HE JUST WENT "OH, OH, OKAY." LIKE NOTHING. HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE.
