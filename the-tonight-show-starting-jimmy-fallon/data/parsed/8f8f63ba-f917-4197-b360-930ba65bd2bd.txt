WE ALL HAD CRAZY JOBS TO MAKE MONEY.
Jimmy: NO, NO, OF COURSE, ABSOLUTELY. YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. BUT YOU ACTUALLY DO PERFORM AT COLLEGES A LOT?
I DO, YEAH, I HAVE BECOME A A HUMORIST, SURPRISINGLY.

WELL, IT'S TRUE, BUT IT'S KIND OF FUNNY, RELEASING A A PAPERBACK TO ME FEELS LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU TAKE A FULL SHOWER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
