Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I FEEL THE LOVE! THAT'S A HOT CROWD. OH, MY GOODNESS. OH, FEELS SO GOOD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, EVERYONE. WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE AT THE SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE CROWD. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. YOU GUYS, WE HAVE JUSTIN BIEBER ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DO WE HAVE ANY BELIEBERS IN THE AUDIENCE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO? OH, WELL. [ LAUGHTER ] GUESS I'M THE BIGGEST BELIEBER HERE. HE'S A GOOD MAN. HE'S GOT A NEW RECORD. HE'S GONNA KILL IT TONIGHT, WHEN YOU SEE HIM. HE'S JUST SO TALENTED. THE GUY -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NEW SONG "SORRY." LET'S GET TO NEWS FIRST. YOU GUYS, I SAW THAT DONALD TRUMP WENT ON TWITTER TODAY AND HE MOCKED RONDA ROUSEY FOR LOSING HER FIGHT THIS PAST WEEKEND. IN RESPONSE, T-MOBILE'S CEO SAID HE'D PAY TO SEE TRUMP FIGHT HER IN THE RING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AT WHICH POINT, TRUMP STARTED BUILDING A WALL AROUND HIMSELF. [ APPLAUSE ] LIKE, I DON'T LIKE THIS. BUILD A GIANT WALL. I'M SORRY. DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, SARAH PALIN ADMITTED THAT KATIE COURIC'S QUESTIONS BACK IN 2008 ABOUT WHAT NEWSPAPERS PALIN READS, WAS ACTUALLY FAIR. THAT'S RIGHT. SHE ADMITTED "I HAD A CRAPPY ANSWER." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED WHAT PAPER SHE READS NOW, PALIN SAID, "HOO, BOY. PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SAW THIS ONE COMING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] UH, UH, UH. THE DAILY -- DAILY, WHAT DO YOU READ? I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU READ? DO YOU READ? I READ THAT, TOO. YEAH." GUYS, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS OVERSEAS THIS WEEK. THAT'S RIGHT, HE'S JOINING OTHER WORLD LEADERS IN TURKEY FOR THE G- 20 SUMMIT. WHICH IS UNUSUAL, BECAUSE NORMALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE GATHERED AROUND TURKEY DEBATING OBAMA, IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF DRUNK UNCLES AT THANKSGIVING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOT MY PRESIDENT. I DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM. ALL RIGHT. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT AGREE WITH THIS. IN POPE FRANCIS' LATEST WEEKLY ADDRESS, POPE FRANCIS CRITICIZED PEOPLE WHO USE THEIR PHONES AT THE DINNER TABLE. WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION THEN, WHO IS ON THEIR PHONE WHILE THEY EAT DINNER WITH THE POPE? [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, THAT'S LIKE -- OH, I'LL BE THERE AS SOON AS I CAN. JUST HAVING A DINNER WITH POPE WHAT'S-HIS-NAME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE'S LOOKING AT ME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHO WOULD DO THAT?
Steve: WHO WOULD DO THAT?
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, THIS IS PRETTY CRAZY. IN A NEW INTERVIEW, MARK ZUCKERBERG SAID FACEBOOK WILL BE MORE INTELLIGENT THAN HUMANS IN TEN YEARS. YEAH, WHEN ASKED HOW HE'D MAKE FACEBOOK SMARTER, ZUCKERBERG SAID, WE WON'T. WE'RE JUST GONNA USE FACEBOOK TO MAKE HUMANS DUMBER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT MAKES SENSE. LIKE ME, LIKE ME. LIKE MY BREAKFAST, PLEASE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, EVERYONE'S GETTING EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW "STAR WARS" MOVIE COMING OUT NEXT MONTH. I'M EXCITED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IN FACT, I SAW THAT THERE'S A A LIFE-SIZED REPLICA OF AN X-WING ON DISPLAY AT AN AIRPORT IN SINGAPORE. YEAH, IT SEATS TWO PEOPLE AND DOESN'T ACTUALLY FLY. THEN JETBLUE SAID "WE'LL TAKE IT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] UH, WE'RE GONNA BE ON THE TARMAC FOR ANOTHER FOUR HOURS. WE HAVE SOME COMPLEMENTARY BLUE TARA CHIPS COMING AROUND, YOU GUYS. GUYS, HERE'S SOME -- THANK YOU. I'M DONE.
Steve: ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: WHAT ELSE GOING ON? HERE'S SOME BUSINESS NEWS HERE, YOU GUYS. MARRIOTT REACHED A $12 BILLION DEAL TO BUY STARWOOD HOTELS AND RESORTS, WHICH NOW MAKES MARRIOTT THE WORLD'S BIGGEST HOTEL CHAIN. THAT'S RIGHT. AT FIRST THE DEAL ONLY COST $9 BILLION, BUT THEN THEY CELEBRATED WITH A TINY BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE FROM THE MINIBAR, MADE IT $12 BILLION. [ APPLAUSE ] I DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT WAS.
Steve: THAT'S PRICEY.
Jimmy: AND THIS IS GOING VIRAL TODAY. DID YOU SEE THIS? THIS IS REALLY FUNNY. I GUESS, A DAD FROM IRELAND USED HIS SON'S GO-PRO TO FILM HIS TRIP TO VEGAS. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS? BUT APPARENTLY, HE DIDN'T REALIZE HE WAS SHOOTING EVERYTHING IN SELFIE MODE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, IT GOES ON FOR LIKE AN HOUR. BUT ANYWAYS, HERE'S SOME HIGHLIGHTS. LOOK AT THIS.

Steve: DOUBLE RAINBOW.
Jimmy: THAT EXPLAINS THE NEW SLOGAN, "WHAT HAPPENED IN VEGAS?" THAT STORY, OF COURSE, IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY DADS, THEY'RE THE SAME EVERYWHERE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FROM. [ APPLAUSE ] LOOK AT THAT RIGHT THERE, DOWN THE STREET. OH, WOW. I SAW THAT THIS WEEK MARKS THE 20th ANNIVERSARY OF THE USB CABLE. THAT'S RIGHT, PEOPLE CELEBRATED THE OCCASION BY PLUGGING IN A A USB CABLE WRONG, FLIPPING IT OVER, AND SOMEHOW STILL WRONG, AND THEN FLIPPING IT OVER A A THIRD TIME AND PLUGGING IT IN CORRECTLY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, PERFECT. WHAT THE HECK AM I DOING WRONG? YOU GUYS, NOW THAT MARIJUANA IS BECOMING LEGAL IN SO MANY PLACES, I SAW THERE'S NOW A A UNIVERSITY CALLED OAKSTERDAM IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. THAT'S JUST A BUSINESS SCHOOL FOR LEGAL MARIJUANA. KIND OF LIKE REGULAR COLLEGE BUT WITH LESS WEED. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? IT'S A BUSINESS SCHOOL. AND FINALLY, THIS REALLY MADE ME LAUGH, YOU GUYS. I SAW THAT TWO ZEBRAS ESCAPED FROM A CIRCUS IN PHILADELPHIA THIS WEEK. AND LED POLICE ON A CHASE THROUGH THE CITY. NOW, OF COURSE, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAW THE ZEBRAS, INCLUDING THIS WOMAN, AND CHECK OUT WHAT SHE WAS WEARING.
IT WAS A DARING ESCAPE, AND FOR A BRIEF TIME SUNDAY AFTERNOON, TWO CUNNING CIRCUS ZEBRAS ALMOST GOT AWAY WITH IT.
EVERYBODY WAS RUNNIN' FULL SPEED. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY CAME AROUND AND CAME AROUND. AND STOPPED RIGHT THERE, AND STARTED TO CROSS. [ APPLAUSE ] I WAS LIKE, IS THAT A ZEBRA?
