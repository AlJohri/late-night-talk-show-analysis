Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOT CROWD! HOT CROWD HERE TONIGHT, BABY. OH, YEAH. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW" EVERYONE! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOT CROWD, HOT SHOW TONIGHT. LET'S GET TO -- HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. A BIG STORY OUT OF WASHINGTON. THEY JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THE BUDGET DEFICIT HAS SHRUNK TO ONLY $486 BILLION. WHICH IS ITS LOWEST POINT SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK OFFICE. OBAMA WAS LIKE, "WELL, I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WORK HARDER AND -- WAIT, IS THAT GOOD NEWS?" [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVEN'T HEARD GOOD NEWS IN -- IT'S A MIRACLE! I HAVEN'T HAD GOOD NEWS IN A A LONG TIME. [ APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF THE PRESIDENT, TODAY, HE GAVE A SPEECH IN CALIFORNIA TO MOTIVATE YOUNG VOTERS BY DISCUSSING HIS COMMITMENTS TO NEW TECHNOLOGY. IRONICALLY, NOBODY HEARD HIM 'CAUSE THEY WERE ALL STARING AT THEIR PHONES. [ LAUGHTER ] THE IDEA WAS -- OF COURSE, MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER AND POLITICIANS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE. IN FACT, DURING A SPEECH YESTERDAY, FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY VOTING CAN ACTUALLY BE A A FUN THING TO DO ON A FIRST DATE. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. REALLY, WHAT BETTER WAY TO MAKE A FIRST DATE GO SMOOTHLY THAN BRINGING UP POLITICS RIGHT OFF THE BAT. [ LAUGHTER ] "WHAT RELIGION ARE YOU?" GET IT OUT OF THE WAY. IT MAKES SENSE SHE IS TRYING TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT. IN FACT, A NEW STUDY ESTIMATES THAT ONLY 3.4% OF ALL AMERICANS WILL VOTE IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS NEXT MONTH. THREE PERCENT, YEAH -- BECAUSE OF THAT, BOTH PARTIES HAVE STARTED CAMPAIGNS WITH ENTIRELY NEW SLOGANS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET OUT TO VOTE, BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL. TAKE A LOOK. HERE'S THE FIRST ONE. YOU KNOW THAT THING YOU DO TO CHOOSE THE PERSON WHO WINS 'DANCING WITH THE STARS?' TRY THAT WITH POLITICIANS." THAT SEEMS LAZY. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE HERE. "IF YOU DON'T VOTE, YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN. WELL, ACTUALLY YOU CAN. BUT IT'S BETTER IF YOU VOTE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA VOTE, ARE YOU?" [ LAUGHTER ] SEEMS LIKE A DOWNER. AND FINALLY THERE'S -- "VOTING! IT'S HOW AVERAGE CITIZENS FOOL THEMSELVES INTO THINKING THEY'RE IN CHARGE!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT IS BUT -- DON'T TELL ME THAT. SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS THIS WEEK, A SPOKESMAN FOR HARRY REID SAID EVEN THOUGH JOE BIDEN MAKES A LOT OF MISTAKES, HE'S STILL ABLE TO CONNECT AND TELLS US WHAT'S ON HIS MIND. IT'S SOUNDS LESS LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENT MORE LIKE A A CHIMPANZEE THAT KNOWS SIGN LANGUAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S SAYING APPLE. HE WANT'S AN APPLE? [ LAUGHTER ] VICE PRESIDENT. YEAH. SPEAKING OF BIDEN, YOU GOT TO SEE THIS PICTURE -- DID YOU SEE THIS PICTURE HIM TODAY, IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET. MR. COOL. HE'S CAMPAIGNING AROUND PORTLAND, OREGON YESTERDAY, HE VISITED A LOCAL ICE CREAM SHOP, TAKE A LOOK AT THE PICTURE. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] 20 BUCKS, BABY. 20 BUCKS. TWO SCOOPS, $20. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: AVIATORS.
Jimmy: YEAH, AVIATORS. OBAMA IS THINKING, "HOW ARE THEY GOING TO HANDLE ISIS, EBOLA, IMIGRATION." BIDEN'S THINKING, "I SHOULD HAVE GOT SPRINKLES ON THIS." [ LAUGHTER ] $20. ICE CREAM CONE? I DON'T CARE. $20. [ APPLAUSE ] GET THIS, A NEW REPORT JUST FOUND THAT CHINA HAS HE HAVE YEAR OVER TAKEN THE U.S. AS THE WORLD'S LARGEST ECONOMY. WELL THAT MAY BE THE CASE, BUT WE STILL TOP THEM IN MANY OTHER IMPORTANT CATEGORIES. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN. AMERICA STILL HAS -- THE MOST REALITY SHOWS WITH THE WORD 'AMERICA' IN THE TITLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: YEAH. YEAH.
Jimmy: WE STILL HAVE THE MOST USES OF THE WORD "MARATHON" TO MEAN WATCHING TV. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, AMERICA STILL HAS THE MOST PEOPLE NAMED JIMMY WITH THEIR OWN LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] USA. THAT'S SOMETHING. SOMETHING GREAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOME MORE BUSINESS NEWS, THE CEO OF THE GAP ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS STEPPING DOWN BECAUSE HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE HE CAN MAKE A A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO THE COMPANY. OF COURSE HE WON'T BE ABLE TO LEAVE FOR A WHILE BECAUSE HE HAS TO REFOLD EVERYTHING RIGHT BEFORE HE LEAVES. [ LAUGHTER ] ANNOYING, ANNOYING JOB. THIS IS COOL. I HEARD THAT JAY-Z AND BEYONCE ARE WORKING ON A SECRET ALBUM -- [ CHEERS ] THE SECRET ALBUM IS GOING TO BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. AS OPPOSED TO MOST COUPLES, WHO TAKE TWO YEARS JUST TO RECORD A A NEW VOICEMAIL GREETING. [ LAUGHTER ] "IT'S BARRY!" "AND SALLY!" AND "WE'RE NOT HERE RIGHT -- WE GOTTA DO IT AGAIN, COME ON. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT HERE RIGHT NOW, COME ON. WE'VE PRACTICED THIS." HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS, NEW YORK STATE IS SPENDING $750 MILLION TO OPEN A SOLAR PLANT IN BUFFALO, WHICH WILL CREATE THOUSANDS OF JOBS. MOST OF THOSE JOBS WILL BE SHOVELING THE SNOW OFF THE SOLAR EQUIPMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUFFALO, THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO PUT THE SOLAR PANELS? [ APPLAUSE ] IDEA'S GREAT, BUT BUFFALO? I THINK OF BUFFALO, I THINK OF SUNSHINE. YEAH.

IT'S MICHAEL CAINE. I KNOW, HE'S A LEGEND. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WILL BE ALL RIGHT. HE WILL BE FINE. HE WILL BE FINE. HE WILL DO IT FOR YOU. HE WON'T RETIRE. WON'T RETIRE. IT'S JUST A JOKE. THESE ARE JUST JOKES. YEAH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] MY GOD. HE LOVES MICHAEL CAINE.
