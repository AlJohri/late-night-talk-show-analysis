[ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] REMINDED ME OF WHAT HE DID AS A A KID AROUND THE DINNER TABLE. LAST NIGHT CNN HOSTED A A DEMOCRATIC FORUM WHERE HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT IF SHE'S ELECTED SHE WANTS TO WORK TOGETHER WITH REPUBLICANS AND EVEN SAID SHE'D GIVE THEM ALL BEAR HUGS. [ LAUGHTER ] BY BEAR HUGS SHE MEANS LIKE THE ONES YOU SAW IN "THE REVENANT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DURING THE FORUM, HILLARY WAS ACTUALLY CHALLENGED BY SOME STUDENTS ABOUT HER LACK OF POPULARITY.
