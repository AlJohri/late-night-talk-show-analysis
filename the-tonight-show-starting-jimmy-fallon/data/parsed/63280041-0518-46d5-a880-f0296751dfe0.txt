Jimmy: AS YOU CERTAINLY KNOW BY NOW, EARLY SUNDAY MORNING THERE WAS ANOTHER SENSELESS SHOOTING, THIS TIME AT A DANCE CLUB IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA. A DANCE CLUB. IT LEFT 49 PEOPLE DEAD, WHICH IS THE LARGEST LOSS OF LIFE DUE TO A TERRORIST ATTACK ON U.S. SOIL SINCE 9/11. I KNOW EVERYONE IS ANGRY RIGHT NOW AND NOT REALLY KNOWING HOW TO REACT BUT THIS IS A TIME WHERE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO US AS A COUNTRY AND HOW WE WILL REACT. THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT ON THE IDEA THAT WE DO NOT ALL AGREE ON EVERYTHING, THAT WE ARE A A TOLERANT FREE NATION THAT ENCOURAGES DEBATE, FREE THINKING, BELIEVING, OR NOT, IN WHAT YOU CHOOSE. I AS A NEW FATHER AM THINKING, "WHAT DO I TELL MY KIDS?" WHAT DO I -- WHAT DO I TELL THEM ABOUT THIS? WHAT CAN I -- WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS? WHAT IF MY KIDS ARE GAY? WHAT DO I TELL THEM? MAYBE THERE'S A LESSON FROM ALL THIS. A LESSON IN TOLERANCE. WE NEED TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER'S DIFFERENCES AND WORRY LESS ABOUT OUR OWN OPINIONS. GET BACK TO DEBATE AND AWAY FROM BELIEVING OR SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT IF SOMEONE DOESN'T LIVE THE WAY YOU WANT THEM TO LIVE, YOU JUST BUY A A GUN AND KILL THEM. JUST BOMB THEM UP. THAT IS NOT OKAY. WE NEED TO GET BACK TO BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO ACCEPT THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND THAT'S OKAY. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT AMERICA IS BUILT ON. THE IDEA THAT WE CAN STAND UP AND SPEAK OUR MINDS AND LIVE OUR LIVES AND NOT BE PUNISHED FOR THAT. OR MOCKED ON THE INTERNET. OR KILLED BY SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW. THIS IS JUST ONE BAD GUY HERE. 49 GOOD PEOPLE AND ONE BAD GUY. AND THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MORE GOOD THAN EVIL. WHEN I THINK OF ORLANDO, I THINK OF NOTHING BUT FUN, AND JOY, AND FAMILIES. IF ANYONE CAN DO IT, YOU CAN. KEEP LOVING EACH OTHER, KEEP RESPECTING EACH OTHER, AND KEEP ON DANCING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. >
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. I LOVE YOU! WELCOME BACK. WE HAVE A BIG SHOW. IT'S GOING TO BE FUN TONIGHT. IT IS MONDAY. WE'RE SO EXCITED TO BE BACK. WE HAVE A BIG WEEK OF SHOWS AHEAD. WE HAVE TWO COMEDY LEGENDS JOINING US THIS WEEK. DON RICKLES AND JAY LENO WILL BE HERE.

WEED LOLLIPOP. ENJOYED THE NIGHT, FELT GREAT, WENT TO BED FEELING FINE. I WOKE UP THE NEXT DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] SLOW MOTION. EVERYTHING'S IN SLOW MOTION. I'M LIKE, "OH, NO. IT'S HAPPENING. THIS IS REAL." BECAUSE I HAD TO BE UP FOR THE TEEN -- THE YOUNG HOLLYWOOD AWARDS.
Jimmy: OKAY.
PRESENTING AT THE YOUNG HOLLYWOOD AWARDS. SO I'M PANICKING. I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, I HAVE TO GO BACK TO BED." SO I TRY TO SLEEP THIS OFF A A LITTLE BIT. I GO BACK TO BED, WAKE UP A A COUPLE HOURS LATER, GET IN THE SHOWER. "YOUR LIFE IS OVER. YOU'RE GOING TO DIE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE HEARING THESE VOICES?
OH, IT'S HORRIBLE. I CALLED DOWN TO MY GIRLFRIEND FROM THE KITCHEN. "BABE, I NEED SOME BREAD! I NEED SOME COFFEE, SOMETHING!" SHE COMES RUNNING UP, TRIES TO HELP ME. I DECIDE TO GO PICK OUT WHAT I'M GOING TO WEAR. I PICK OUT A RED SUIT, WHICH WAS A GREAT DECISION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I GET IN THE CAR --
Jimmy: OUT OF ALL YOUR SUITS, YEAH, THE RED ONE. YEAH, THE ONE YOU WANT.
I GET IN THE CAR. I'M TRYING TO FOCUS, GET IN THE RIGHT MIND FRAME. I'M FEELING BETTER. AND THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE, I GET A NARB.
Jimmy: WHAT IS THAT NOW -- A A NARB?
A NARB. LOOK, ALL MEN GET AN NARB FROM TIME TO TIME. A NARB IS A NON-APPARENT REASON BONER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ SO THE NARB STARTS --
Jimmy: NARB? [ LAUGHTER ]
N-A-R-B, NARB.
Jimmy: NO APPARENT REASON? [ LAUGHTER ]
NO APPARENT REASON. IT'S JUST THERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
Jimmy: OKAY.
SO, I'M STANDING ON THE RED CARPET, LITERALLY, LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU GUYS THINK WE'RE JOKING. WE HAVE A PHOTO.
OH, NO.
Jimmy: THIS IS YOU ON THE RED CARPET. THAT'S YOU ON THE RED CARPET. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
IT'S SO GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SERIOUS THOUGH. OH, MY GOSH. IT DOESN'T END THERE. SO, I'M PRESENTING AN AWARD, AND ANSEL ELGORT IS JUST REALLY TALL.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I'M NOT AT ALL. SO I GET UP, AND I STAND ON STAGE PROBABLY FOR 20 SECONDS WITHOUT SAYING A WORD, JUST LOOKING AROUND. IT'S ALL HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
Jimmy: YOU'RE IN LOLLY LAND RIGHT NOW, YEAH.
I PICK UP THE MICROPHONE, AND I TRIED TO SAY A JOKE THAT WASN'T ON THE SCRIPT, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA JUST BE AMAZING. [ LAUGHTER ] I GET UP, AND I'M LIKE, "I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM ANSEL, BUT I'M SHORT-ER." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BECAUSE THE WORD SHORTER.
I COULDN'T DO IT.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW -- WE HAVE THIS CLIP OF YOU ON THE STAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHOW IT. THIS IS REAL. IT'S ALL REAL. HERE'S A CLIP. HERE'S NICK JONAS TRY TO DO HIS JOKE. WATCH THIS. [ CHEERS ]
I REALLY WANTED TO PICK THIS MIC UP SO I COULD HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AS ANSEL, BUT I'M A A SHORT-ER PERSON THAN HIM, SO THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SHORT-ER. I'M SHORT-ER. I'M A SHORT-ER PERSON THAN HE IS, AND I AM A ROBOT, AND I WILL BE HERE ALL NIGHT. IT FEELS SO GREAT TO BE HERE! [ LAUGHTER ]
GOD, THAT'S SO FUNNY.
Jimmy; GOSH, SHORT-ER.
SO, ANYWAYS, I WALKED UPSTAGE. I LOOKED AT MY MANAGER. I WAS LIKE, "YOU THINK ANYBODY KNEW?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S LIKE, "YEAH, I THINK THEY DID."
YES, THEY DEFINITELY DID.
Jimmy: YES, THEY DEFINITELY KNEW.
OH, WELL.
Jimmy: "LAST YEAR WAS COMPLICATED."
YES, IT WAS.
Jimmy: EACTLY, A COUPLE MONTHS AGO WAS COMPLICATED. [ LAUGHTER ] OR A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS BREAKING GLASS. WERE YOU IN DANGER AT ALL?
IT'S LIKE SUGAR GLASS. I HAD TO CLOSE MY EYES FOR IT. THEY BROKE IT ON THE BACK OF MY HEAD SEVEN TIMES.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
I THINK THE PHOTOGRAPHER JUST DIDN'T LIKE ME IS WHAT IT WAS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EXACTLY, WOW.
AND THEN, THEY PUT THE EYES BACK ON MY FACE.
Jimmy: 'CAUSE YOUR EYES WERE CLOSED.
WE ASKED THEM LIKE, "CAN YOU DO THAT? CAN YOU MAKE IT LOOK GOOD?" THEY SAID, IF THEY MADE "AVATAR." THEY CAN DO THAT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH. THE TITLE, JAY-Z HELPED YOU OUT WITH THE TITLE.
HE DID. SO, JAY AND MY MANAGER, PHIL, ARE NOW PARTNERS. AND I TOOK MEETING WITH JAY TO PLAY THE MUSIC, AND GET HIS THOUGHTS. AND I HAD A DIFFERENT TITLE PICKED OUT, AND HE BASICALLY SAID, "ALL RIGHT, I HAVE TO GET TO KNOW YOU, HEARING THE MUSIC. I FEEL LIKE WE CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT BETTER THAT EMBODIES THE WHOLE BODY OF WORK." HE SAID, "WHAT WAS THE LAST YEAR OF YOUR LIFE LIKE FOR YOU?" I SAID, "LAST YEAR WAS COMPLICATED." AND HE SAID, "THAT'S THE TITLE."
Jimmy: WOW.
I WAS LIKE, "YES." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A A FRIEND LIKE JAY-Z TO HELP YOU OUT WITH THAT STUFF. AND THEN I SAW -- I SAW A SONG ON HERE CALLED "BACON."
YES, THAT IS THE REAL TITLE OF THE SONG.
Jimmy: BACON'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED. [ LAUGHTER ] BACON'S PRETTY EASY.
IT WAS AFTER WE SHOT THE MUSIC VIDEO. I ATE SO MUCH BACON AND THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE FINE, SIMILAR TO THIS OTHER STORY. DIDN'T END SO WELL.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU ATE A LOT OF BACON?
IN THE RESTROOM FOR QUITE A A WHILE.
Jimmy: WE'RE LEARNING AGO LOT. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU WEREN'T BEST FRIENDS BEFORE, WE ARE NOW.
TOO MUCH INFORMATION?
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. WE LIKE YOU, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT I WANT TO -- BECAUSE -- WHAT IS "BACON," THE IDEA OF "BACON" ABOUT?
THE IDEA OF "BACON" IS THAT LIFE IS SO GOOD AND YOU'RE SO HAPPY AFTER REALIZING YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY AFTER A A BREAK-UP AND ALL THAT STUFF, THAT IT'S SO GOOD, YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW SOME BACON ON THAT, MAKE IT THAT MUCH BETTER.
Jimmy: YEAH, EVERYTHING'S BETTER WITH BACON ON IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. NOW, YOU'RE ON TOUR WITH MY PAL, DEMI LOVATO.
THAT'S YOUR HOMEGIRL.
Jimmy: MY BFF. THAT'S MY GIRL.
SO YOU GUYS ARE BFFs NOW, RIGHT?
Jimmy: WE'VE BEEN BFFs FOR A A LITTLE WHILE, ME AND DEMI LOVATO.
I'M GONNA SET UP. MAYBE I CAN BE BFFF. JUST, LIKE, ONE BETTER THAN DEMI.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH?
A LITTLE BIT OF COMPETITION ON THE TOUR.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A LITTLE UPSET ABOUT THAT? HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?
WAS KIND OF SALTY WHEN I HEARD THAT SHE WAS YOUR BFF.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU WERE UPSET ABOUT THAT.
SO I WAS, "LIKE, I'M GOING TO TELL THIS OUTRAGEOUS STORY ABOUT" --
Jimmy: ABOUT A NARB, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
