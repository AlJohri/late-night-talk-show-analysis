Questlove: 225 BATON ROUGE!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH I FEEL -- I FEEL THE LOVE! I FEEL THE LOVE, EVERYBODY! I FEEL THE LOVE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HI. THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AT HOME. THIS IS GREAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HAPPY TO BE BACK. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. DURING HIS WEEKLY ADDRESS TO THE NATION, PRESIDENT OBAMA DISCUSSED HIGHER EDUCATION. AND SAID, "THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL YOU CAN SELL IS YOUR KNOWLEDGE." OR AS ENGLISH MAJORS WORKING AT STARBUCKS PUT IT -- "NO, IT'S NOT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "WALTER HERE?" [ LAUGHTER ] THIS WEEKEND PRESIDENT OBAMA ATTENDED THE ANNUAL GRIDIRON CLUB AND FOUNDATION DINNER. AND DURING HIS SPEECH HE JOKED THAT HE'S GETTING OLDER AND CRANKIER. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY HE ANNOUNCED HE NO LONGER SUPPORTS PRESIDENT OBAMA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ BARACK OBAMA IMPRESSION ] "I DON'T THINK THAT GUY LOVES AMERICA. WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS BORN." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS WAS NICE. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, HE'S A GOOD GUY. HE RECENTLY SHOWED HIS SUPPORT FOR MICHELLE OBAMA'S "GIMME FIVE" CAMPAIGN WHEN HE TWEETED OUT THIS VINE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
YEAH. YEAH. I DO A MILLION OF THESE A DAY. SO, JUST GIVE ME FIVE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SOMETHING TELLS ME BIDEN HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE PRETENDING TO BE ON THE PHONE. [ LAUGHTER ] "UH-HUH, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BATMAN. YEAH, YEAH. I DO A MILLION OF THESE. A MILLION OF THESE EVERY DAY. HOLD ON. SPONGEBOB, HEY!" [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S PRETTY, THAT'S FUNNY. I LIKE WHAT HE DID THERE. BUT YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT HE DID FOR AN EARLIER TAKE. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS --
YEAH. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DO A MILLION OF THESE A DAY. SO, JUST GIVE ME FIVE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: JUST GIVE HIM THE -- NO.
Steve: WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS. WISCONSIN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER ANNOUNCED THAT BOTH OF HIS SONS ARE SKIPPING COLLEGE THIS FALL TO HELP WITH HIS CAMPAIGN. YEP. HILLARY WAS LIKE, "I WISH I HAD TWO COLLEGE AGED SONS TO HELP WITH MY CAMPAIGN." AND BILL WAS LIKE -- [ BILL CLINTON IMPRESSION ] "I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "YOU SHOULD SIT DOWN." OF COURSE HILLARY'S DEALING WITH THIS E-MAIL SCANDAL. A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING IT COULD DERAIL HER CHANCES FOR 2016. I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU LISTEN TO HILLARY EXPLAIN IT, IT ALL SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE. LISTEN.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER TO CARRY JUST ONE DEVICE FOR MY WORK AND FOR MY PERSONAL E-MAILS INSTEAD OF TWO. I WANTED TO JUST USE ONE DEVICE FOR BOTH PERSONAL AND WORK E-MAILS INSTEAD OF TWO. EVEN IF I'D HAD TWO DEVICES, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY PERMITTED, MANY PEOPLE DO THAT, ONE DEVICE, TWO DEVICES, THREE DEVICES. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW LOOKING BACK THINK THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SMARTER TO HAVE THOSE TWO DEVICES FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, OKAY. OKAY. YEAH. THANKS. THANKS SO MUCH. YEAH, YOU CLEARED THAT UP. BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ONE DEVICE AND THE SECOND DEVICE BREAKS, THEN YOU USE THE SECOND DEVICE AS THE FIRST DEVICE, WHICH IS PERFECTLY -- EVERYONE DOES THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IF THE SECOND DEVICE ISN'T THE FIRST ONE, THEN YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH DEVICE IS THE -- IF YOU PICK UP THE WRONG DEVICE -- [ LAUGHTER ] THEN YOUR STUCK USING THE DEVICE. [ APPLAUSE ] EVEN ROBERT DURST WAS LIKE, "STOP TALKING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S ANOTHER STORY OUT OF WASHINGTON. CONGRESS IS CURRENTLY SPLIT ON THE FUTURE OF NASA'S FUNDING BECAUSE SOME REPUBLICANS WANT TO FOCUS ON SPACE EXPLORATION WHILE DEMOCRATS ARE FOCUSED MORE ON EARTH. BUT MY ISSUE IS THAT IF WE END UP FOCUSING JUST ON EARTH WE MAY HURT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL OF THE EXTRATERRESTRIALS OUT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IF YOU GUYS DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION DIRECTLY TO ALIENS IN THEIR NATIVE TONGUE. [ SCI-FI MUSIC ] ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] KRYLAX. KY NOY-NOY JIMMY FALLON.

Steve: I THINK THAT DID CLEAR IT UP.
Jimmy: WE'VE BEEN ON BREAK FOR A WEEK, I'M GETTING A A LITTLE LOOPY.

Jimmy: I'M HAPPY TO BE BACK. I SAW THAT DISNEY'S LIVE ACTION MOVIE "CINDERELLA" WHICH ALSO FEATURED A SHORT "FROZEN" CARTOON CAME IN NUMBER ONE AT THE BOX OFFICE THIS WEEKEND, WITH AN ESTIMATED $70 MILLION. SO THAT STORY AGAIN -- A SHORT "FROZEN" CARTOON MADE $70 MILLION. [ LAUGHTER ] AND "CINDERELLA" WAS SOMEWHERE BY THE END OF THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY HERE. I READ THAT A GRANDMOTHER IN SOUTH AFRICA CELEBRATED HER 100th BIRTHDAY ON SATURDAY BY GOING SKYDIVING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. MOST PEOPLE TURNING 100 USUALLY GO THE OTHER DIRECTION IN THE SKY. AND YOU GO -- [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A VERY OLD AGE. YOU COULD TELL SHE WAS PRETTY OLD, BECAUSE THEY USED HER ARM FLAB AS A PARACHUTE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ PROPELLER SOUND ] LIKE A FLYING SQUIRREL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ SQUIRREL SOUNDS ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS WAS GOING VIRAL TODAY. DID YOU SEE THIS HIGGINS?
Steve: YES.
Jimmy: THIS IS FUNNY. POLAND'S MINISTER OF DEFENSE GAVE A SPEECH THIS WEEK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL SECURITY. RIGHT? BUT I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE MIXED UP HIS MICROPHONE WITH THE PODIUM LAMP. TAKE A LOOK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, HE WAS ABLE TO TELL AN AMAZING GHOST STORY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN HE GETS AN IDEA, A LITTLE MICROPHONE POPS UP OVER HIS HEAD. IT'S REALLY CUTE. REALLY CUTE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW, YOU GUYS. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

IT WAS ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT LYING. THAT IS NOT A LIE. THIS IS TRULY --
Jimmy: HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT LYING? YOU'RE A GOOD ACTOR.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ON A A SHOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN A A ROW, YOU GET USED TO KIND OF WEIRD THINGS HAPPENING. BEING IMPERSONATED ON "SNL" IS NOT ONE OF THEM. AND I WAS IN CALIFORNIA THE NIGHT IT AIRED. SO I WAS ON THE WEST COAST. AND TRICKLING THROUGH THE COUNTRY PEOPLE I KNOW STARTED TEXTING ME. JIMMY FALLON'S DOING YOU ON "SNL." I WAS LIKE, WOW, THAT'S REALLY NEAT AND I'M SO SCARED. WHAT IS HE DOING? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS HE DOING? BUT YOU WERE WONDERFUL AND YOU WERE REALLY NICE. AND YOU DID IT REALLY WELL.
Jimmy: NO, WELL, I TRIED. I'M LIKE A DOUGHIER VERSION OF YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]

YOU WERE REALLY GOOD. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO PERFECT ME?
Jimmy: OH. MINUTES. [ LAUGHTER ] I FEEL LIKE MORE THAN -- LIKE, ALMOST --
DO YOU KNOW WHAT? I DO HAVE A THEORY. I CAN DO NO IMPERSONATIONS. I CAN DO NO INTERPRETATIONS OF OTHERS, NOTHING. AND I THINK I AM -- I DO THINK I'M EASILY MIMICABLE.
Jimmy: NO.
WELL, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT I BRING TO THE PARTY.
Jimmy: NO.
EASY TO MAKE FUN.
Jimmy: BUT NO, YOU CREATED A A GREAT CHARACTER IN SHELDON.
WELL, THERE'S THAT, SURE.
Jimmy: WHERE YOU CAN DO ANY NERDY REFERENCE, WHICH YOU PROBABLY DON'T DO IN REAL LIFE. YOU ALSO DO -- THE WAY YOU LAUGH.

ONE OF THE MOST GRATIFYING EXPERIENCES. IT WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL PLAY, SUCH A WONDERFUL GROUP OF PEOPLE, VERY POWERFUL TIME IN MY ACTING LIFE.
Jimmy: AND NOW HERE YOU ARE.
I'M GOING TO PLAY GOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. BABY STEPS.
NOW, I'VE GROWN INTO GOD. NO, THE PREMISE IS THAT GOD HAS SOME THINGS HE'D LIKE TO SAY TO PEOPLE AND HE THINKS A GOOD WAY TO DO THAT IS BROADWAY. HE'S GOT A SHOWMAN TYPE PERSONALITY. IT'S A GOOD SHOW, GOD. BUT IF HE WAS JUST GOD YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE HIM OR HEAR HIM. HE HAS TO PLUCK A HUMAN BODY TO INTERPRET HIM. SO, IT'S A VERY FREEING PREMISE. WITHIN THE FIRST MINUTES OF THE PLAY I SAY, "I'M GOD, YADA, YADA, YADA, AND I'M IN THE BODY OF JIM PARSONS. HE HAS NO IDEA HE'S HERE." AND I'M LIKE -- AND I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY ANYMORE. I GET TO SAY ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT RELIGION AND GOD. BUT IT'S NOT ME.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: CONGRATS ON CATCHPHRASE.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YEAH. I REALLY WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU THOUGH BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN COMING ON OUR SHOW SINCE YOUR FIRST MOVIE.
YEAH. THIS IS MY THIRD TIME ON THIS SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, WE CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOU, MAN. WE'RE BIG FANS OF YOU HERE. YOU KNOW, I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU. AND THEN HERE'S THE HOLLYWOOD ISSUE OF "VANITY FAIR," OOH LA LA. AND THAT IS NOT YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT -- ONE DAY. ONE DAY MAYBE IT CAN BE. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. LOOK AT THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU'VE GOT TO OPEN IT UP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, COME ON. THAT'S AN HONOR.
BUT NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. ONE DAY I'LL BE ON THE -- ON THE FRONT. YOU DON'T GOT TO FOLD IT OPEN.
Jimmy: THIS IS A GIANT DEAL RIGHT THERE.
THAT WAS GREAT. WE WERE ALL ACTUALLY HANGING OUT --
Jimmy: CAN WE ZOOM IN? THAT'S A NICE MUSTACHE YOU'VE GOT THERE GOING. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S TAKING AN EMBARRASSINGLY LONG TIME.
Jimmy: ARE YOU PLAYING JUSTIN BIEBER IN A MOVIE? [ LAUGHTER ] CAN YOU GROW A MUSTACHE?
JIMMY. NO, HONESTLY, LIKE IF YOU WERE TO LOOK BACK AT THE TAPE, I'M PRETTY SURE -- I WAS ON HERE FOR "WHIPLASH," AND I WAS GROWING IT OUT. AND I TAKE A LONG TIME TO GROW SOME FACIAL HAIR, MAN. EVERYONE HAS THEIR STRENGTHS. I'M A GREAT DANCER. I HAVE GOOD HAIR. I DON'T' HAVE LIKE WEIRD BODY HAIR, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Jimmy: GROWING A STACHE.
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO JUST GROW LIKE A THICK TOM SELLECK MUSTACHE.
JIMMY: ME TOO!
YEAH, I WOULD LOVE TO GROW THAT BUT I PHYSICALLY CAN'T. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
Jimmy: I GREW A WISPY ONE FOR MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK. A GOOD WHISPER -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE A "TOUCH AND FEEL" IN MY YEARBOOK. IT'S LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] FLOPPING AND FLOWING LIKE LONG LOCKS OF HAIR. I WOULD ACTUALLY FRENCH BRAID MY MUSTACHE IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT THAT WAS -- I SEE THIS IS FOR A ROLE.
I PLAYED VINNY PAZ, YEAH. WHO, IF YOU'RE FROM THE NORTHEAST, IF YOU'RE FROM THE BOSTON AREA, RHODE ISLAND, YOU KNOW WHO HE IS. HE WAS A FIVE-TIME WORLD CHAMPION.
Jimmy: DID HE GET IN AN ACCIDENT?
YEAH. CRAZY COMEBACK STORY. HE WAS A TWO-TIME WORLD CHAMPION BUT THEY THOUGHT HE WAS KIND OF AT THE END OF HIS RUN. MOVED UP THREE WEIGHT CLASSES, WAS A 10/1 UNDERDOG, WON THE BELT, HUGE WIN. AND THEN GOT IN A CAR ACCIDENT A COUPLE WEEKS LATER, BROKE TWO VERTEBRAE IN HIS NECK. AND THEY SAID HE MIGHT NEVER WALK AGAIN. HE WOULD DEFINITELY NEVER BOX AGAIN. HE HAD THE METAL HALO PUT IN HIS HEAD, THE SCREWS PUT IN HIS HEAD. FIVE DAYS LATER, HE STARTED WORKING OUT AGAIN BECAUSE HE KNEW, HE SAID IF I COULDN'T BOX THEN I KNEW THAT WASN'T MY PLAN. AND A YEAR, LATER HE COMES BACK AND WINS THE TITLE, AND IT'S JUST A CRAZY STORY. THE GUY'S LIKE THE DEFINITION OF JUST A WARRIOR AND A A CHAMPION. AND I WAS HONORED. WHEN THEY OFFERED ME THE PART I WAS LIKE, "WELL, I CAN'T GROW A A MUSTACHE. I'M NOT IN VERY GOOD SHAPE." I LITERALLY SAID, "LIKE, ARE YOU SURE?" [ LAUGHTER ] I REALLY GOT TO ASK. YEAH, EXACTLY, BECAUSE I WAS JUST VERY INTIMIDATED BY THE GUY'S STORY.
Jimmy: WELL, WE HAVE A A PICTURE OF YOU.
HOW'D YOU FIND THAT PHOTO? THAT I GAVE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] I LOOK SO RIPPED.
Jimmy: BEFORE AND AFTER. LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.
THAT WAS -- YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
GUYS, STOP.
Jimmy: THIS IS JUST YOUR HEAD ON MY BODY. THIS IS YOUR HEAD ON MY BODY. DOES THAT NOT LOOK LIKE ME? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SCORSESE'S INVOLVED THIS?
HE'S A PRODUCER ON IT, YEAH. AND BEN YOUNGER, WHO DID "BOILER-ROOM," WROTE AND DIRECTED "BOILER-ROOM." HE'S OUR DIRECTOR ON THIS AND WROTE IT, AN INCREDIBLE SCRIPT. AND IT SHOULD COME OUT THIS FALL. I'LL COME ON YOUR SHOW, PLAYING BEER PONG, BEAT YOU. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: HEY, YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE THIS ANYMORE, PAL!
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M ROCKING UNDER THIS SUIT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT.
Jimmy: I ALREADY SAW THE SPANX HANGING IN THE HALLWAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, YEAH. A WAR OF WORDS RIGHT NOW, JIMMY. THE MUSTACHE JOKE, THE SPANX.
Jimmy: THE SPANX JOKE WAS A A GOOD ONE. I'VE GOT TO SAY -- YOU KNOW I'M THE BIGGEST FAN OF YOURS HERE. "INSURGENT" IS THE NEW "DIVERGENT" MOVIE COMING OUT. IT'S GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD. I LOVED YOU IN THE FIRST ONE.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IN THE SECOND ONE, YOU'RE IN WITH -- HOW'S OUR PAL SHAILENE WOODLEY?
SHAILENE. SHE'S BACK.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] SPOILER ALERT. SPOILER ALERT. DON'T GIVE TOO MUCH AWAY.
SHAILENE WOODLEY'S IN IT. SHE'S GREAT. SHE CUTS HER HAIR IN THIS ONE.
Jimmy: SHE'S THE MOST POSITIVE HUMAN BEING. SHE'S JUST HAPPY. EVERY TIME SHE COMES ON, SHE GIVES ME A NEW TEA I SHOULD BE DRINKING.
OR LIKE SOMETHING PHALLIC. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE A PHALLIC HORSERADISH.
Jimmy: SHE DID BRING ME A A WEIRD LOOKING HORSERADISH. YEAH, YEAH, IT WAS VERY AWKWARD. THAT WAS AWKWARD BUT IT WAS FUN.
BUT NO SHAILENE'S GREAT. LITERALLY, SHE'S THE KIND OF GIRL WHERE WE'LL BE ON SET AND I FIRST SEE HER IN THE MORNING AND SHE'S JUST SMILING FROM EAR TO EAR. AND I'M LIKE "SHAILENE, YOU LOOK KIND OF BUZZED, WHAT'S GOING ON?" AND SHE'S LIKE, "I JUST HAD SOME ALMONDS. AND THEY'RE SO GOOD." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE BEST ALMONDS.
I'VE HEARD HER SAY LIKE, "I LOVE EGGS." [ LAUGHTER ] AND LIKE -- AND NOW THAT I'M ON MY CRAZY DIET AND STUFF, I'M LIKE I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET THAT CLEAN, YOU FEEL ALMONDS AND YOU FEEL EGGS.
Jimmy: YOU FEEL IT IN A A DIFFERENT WAY.
LIKE, GUYS, I'M TELLING YOU. THIS ALMOND STUFF. YOU CAN MAKE MILK OUT OF IT. YOU CAN DO ALMOND BUTTER.
Jimmy: WE'LL SAVE THAT FOR NEXT TIME.
NEXT TIME, I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU MAKE ALMONDS WITH.
Jimmy: WE'LL DO THAT RIGHT AFTER I BEAT YOU AT BEER PONG. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT.
I LOVE IT BECAUSE NOW THE NEXT TIME IT'S HAPPENING. I JUST LOVE IT. I'M HAPPY I GOT TO PLAY A GAME. I ALWAYS LOOK AT PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAMES AND I'M LIKE, I WANT TO PLAY A GAME.
Jimmy: YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. WE LOVE MILES TELLER ON OUR SHOW. COME ON, MAN. WE LOVE YOU, BUDDY.
OH, COME ON, STOP. STOP! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW A A CLIP. HERE'S OUR PAL MILES TELLER IN "INSURGENT." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WHY DID YOU SURRENDER TO ERUDITE? WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I WOULD LIKE A POSITION IN YOUR REGIME. IDEALLY, I WOULD LIKE A A POSITION WITH SOME ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. I MAY BE DULL, MISS, BUT I'M NOT JUST A MEATHEAD. NO OFFENSE, MAX. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
