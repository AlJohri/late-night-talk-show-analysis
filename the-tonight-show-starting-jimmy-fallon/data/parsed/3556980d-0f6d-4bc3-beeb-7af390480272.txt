Questlove: 646, MANHATTAN! YEAH!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EVERYBODY, THANK YOU! ENERGY! THAT IS THE LOVE. THAT IS THE LOVE. I FEEL THE LOVE. I GIVE IT RIGHT BACK TO YOU. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, BABY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. GUYS, THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. HOW MANY OF YOU ARE HERE ON VACATION? [ CHEERS ] NOW, HOW MANY OF YOU ARE CONGRESSMEN HIDING FROM TRUMP BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T VOTE FOR HIS HEALTHCARE? [ CHEERS ] MY HAPPY AUDIENCE. THAT'S THE BIG STORY TODAY. THE REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL WAS PULLED AFTER THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO PASS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OR AS TRUMP WOULD SAY --E
IT'S GOING DOWN THE TUBERS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: GOING DOWN THE TUBERS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, THIS BILL WAS NOT WELL-RECEIVED AT ALL. IN FACT, NANCY PELOSI CALLED THE REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL "A MORAL MONSTROSITY." THEN TRUMP SAID, "OKAY, PUT HER DOWN AS A 'MAYBE.'" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "SHE DIDN'T SAY NO." ACTUALLY, GET THIS. I READ THAT JUST 13% OF WOMEN SUPPORTED THE REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE REPLACEMENT BILL. WHEN HE HEARD THAT, PAUL RYAN WAS LIKE, "WOMEN, I KNEW WE FORGOT TO INCLUDE SOMEONE. WOMEN! PUT THAT IN THE BILL, WOMEN. [ APPLAUSE ] OH, GOSH. THANK YOU." TRUMP WAS NOT HAPPY. HE SAID THAT IF THIS HEALTHCARE BILL DIDN'T PASS, HE WOULD JUST LEAVE OBAMACARE IN PLACE. KIND OF A WEIRD THREAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE SAYING, "IF YOU KIDS DON'T STOP FIGHTING BACK THERE, I'M GOING TO DRIVE THIS CAR STRAIGHT TO DISNEY WORLD!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "WE'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE! AND WE'LL RIDE AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT!" [ LAUGHTER ] THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER SAID THAT TRUMP DID EVERYTHING HE COULD TO GET SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. HE SAID, "AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU CAN'T FORCE SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING." THEN HE ADDED, "EXPECT SENDING ME OUT HERE EVERY DAY TO LIE THROUGH MY TEETH." HE SAID, "BUT, BESIDES THAT" -- [ APPLAUSE ] AT HIS PRESS BRIEFING TODAY, SPICER WAS DOING ALL HE COULD TO MOVE PAST HEALTHCARE AND ALL THE OTHER PROBLEMS TRUMP'S DEALING WITH. HE WAS TRYING TO SAY THAT AMERICANS REALLY WANT TAX REFORM, BUT HE SLIPPED UP A A LITTLE BIT. TAKE A LISTEN.
I THINK THERE'S A HUGE APPETITE FOR TAX RETURN -- TAX REFORM. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S A HUGE -- HUGE APPETITE. YEAH, THERE'S AN APPETITE FOR THAT. YEAH. "I'M SORRY, NEXT RUSSIAN -- I MEAN, QUESTION. NEXT QUESTION, WHAT I SAY?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I'M REALLY PUTIN MY FOOT IN MY MOUTH -- PUTTING MY FOOT. OH, FORGET IT. BYE, I'M LEAVING." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "OFF TO DISNEY WORLD! FRONT OF THE LINE!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MEANWHILE, YESTERDAY GEORGIA CONGRESSMAN BARRY LOUDERMILK PREDICTED LAWMAKERS WOULDN'T BE GIVEN MUCH TIME TO READ THE HEALTHCARE BILL BEFORE BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON IT, SAYING, QUOTE, "WE HAVE FOUR TO FIVE HOURS TO DIGEST IT." WELL, BARRY LOUDERMILK WASN'T THE ONLY CONGRESSMAN TO WEIGH IN. CONGRESSMAN LARRY SOFTERCREAM SAID, "I AGREE WITH BARRY. FOUR TO FIVE HOURS IS NEVER ENOUGH TIME TO DIGEST." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "TAKE IT FROM ME, LARRY SOFTERCREAM." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CONGRESSMAN GARY SILENT-SOY SAID, "I DISAGREE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THE BILL WON'T BE AS HARD TO DIGEST AND OTHERS SAY IT IS." CONGRESSWOMAN MARY MID-VOLUME-RICE-DREAM SAID, "I AGREE WITH GARY. EASY TO DIGEST, I THINK." AND FINALLY THIS CONGRESSMAN SAID, "I THINK IT'S A DISASTER, AND I SHOULD KNOW. I'M HARRY NOISY-EGG-NOG." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IS THAT A BRITISH NAME?
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
Steve: IT'S TWO FAMILIES.
Jimmy: YEAH, OH, YEAH.
Steve: TWO FAMILIES EGG FAMILY AND THE NOG FAMILY.
Jimmy: NOISY AND EGG-NOG, YEAH.
Steve: THEY'VE JOINED FORCES.
Jimmy: LET'S GET TO SOME BUSINESS NEWS. I READ THAT STARTING THIS SPRING, APPLE IS GOING TO START MAKING iPHONES IN INDIA. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] THEN TRUMP SAID, "I TOLD YOU I'D GET THEM TO STOP MAKING STUFF IN CHINA." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "I TOLD YOU. TECHNICALLY, I WIN. NO MORE CHINA." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS. THE POWER RANGERS MOVIE OPENS THIS WEEKEND, YOU GUYS. OOH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S A FILM ABOUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE GAINING AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF POWER, THEN SQUANDERING IT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AGREE ON A HEALTHCARE PLAN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S A VERY INTERESTING. THIS IS PRETTY COOL. THIS WEEK, MICHAEL PHELPS POSTED ON INSTAGRAM A STARBUCKS BARISTA LABELED HIS COFFEE "THE GOAT" -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FOR "GREATEST OF ALL TIME." [ AUDIENCE AWS ] WHILE ANOTHER CUSTOMER WAS LIKE, "ACTUALLY, I THINK THERE WAS A MIX-UP. THEY, UH -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GOT MY LATTE, OR" -- THIS WAS WEIRD A LITTLE GIRL IN AUSTRALIA PACKED HER OWN LUNCH FOR SCHOOL THIS WEEK, AND CHECK OUT WHAT SHE BROUGHT.
A POST GOES VIRAL THIS MORNING AFTER A 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL ACCIDENTALLY PACKS HER A FROZEN VODKA DRINK. [ LAUGHTER ] MOM SAYS SHE TOLD HER DAUGHTER TO GRAB A FROZEN JUICE POUCH FROM THE FREEZER, BUT THE LITTLE GIRL GRABBED THIS INSTEAD. MOM GOT AN INTERESTING PHONE CALL AS YOU CAN IMAGINE FROM THE TEACHER THAT DAY.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. THE TEACHER WAS LIKE, "ARE YOU UP?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DIDN'T KNOW THOSE THINGS EXISTED.
Steve: YEAH.

I LIVED DOWNTOWN L.A. BEFORE THERE WAS A DOWNTOWN L.A., I LIVED DOWN -- IT WAS JUST LIKE -- TRASH CANS ON FIRE.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT REALLY IS. YEAH, VENICE IS GREAT, THOUGH.
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: DO YOU REMEMBER A A PLACE CALLED "VAN GOGH'S EAR?"
I DO. I TOTALLY DO.
Jimmy: DO YOU REMEMBER, IT WAS LIKE A CAFE?
YEAH, YEAH, I TOTALLY REMEMBER THAT.
Jimmy: I USED TO GO THERE -- IT'S CLOSED NOW, BUT I USED TO GO THERE WHEN I DID STAND-UP. I LIVED OUT IN L.A. AND I JUST WOULD GO -- AND I COULD ONLY AFFORD TEA. CHAMOMILE, I'D GO AND JUST HANG OUT, AND TRY TO LIKE WRITE JOKES AND --
OH, YEAH, YEAH. VENICE WAS COOL -- IT WAS SKETCHY AT ONE POINT.
Jimmy: IT REALLY WAS SKETCHY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT WAS, YEAH -- I REMEMBER SOMEBODY SAID, BECAUSE, LIKE, MY ROOMMATE DROVE ME THERE AND THEY SAID, "HEY, LEAVE YOUR CAR UNLOCKED, BECAUSE PEOPLE COME AND IF THE DOOR'S LOCKED, THEY'LL BREAK IT."
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: SO LET THEM JUST BREAK INTO YOUR CAR.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH.
Jimmy: OKAY. WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE COOL. LET'S GO HOME.
SAME AS DOWNTOWN, SAME THING.

YEAH, IT'S COOL.
Jimmy: DID YOU EVER GET INTO A -- KNOCK ON WOOD -- AN ACCIDENT ON YOUR BIKE?
YEAH. I'VE BEEN IN A FEW. I ONLY HAD ONE REALLY BIG ONE. I WAS -- YOU KNOW WHERE THAT 101 CAFE IS IN HOLLYWOOD? YOU KNOW THAT 101 CAFE BY THE 101 FREEWAY?
Jimmy: LIKE A FOOD SHOW.
IT'S LIKE THE CALIFORNIA --
Jimmy: THE CALIFORNIA FOOD SHOW, YEAH. THE 101 CAFé, YEAH, I KNOW THE 101, BUT I DON'T KNOW --
YEAH, THERE'S A CAFE RIGHT THERE. BUT TO GET ON THE FREEWAY, I WAS MAKING A RIGHT TO GET ON THE FREEWAY AND THESE TWO OLD PEOPLE ACTUALLY PULLED UP IN A A CAR INTO MY LANE AND I SORT OF SAW THEM DO LIKE THIS AS I FLEW OVER THEIR CAR. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] AND THEN THE BIKE WAS KIND OF DOING LIKE -- A CARTWHEEL IN THE AIR THAT WAY, AND THEN I LANDED, AND THEN I HAD WARRANTS OUT FOR MY ARREST. BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE FOR THIS INTERVIEW.
Jimmy: WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?
YEAH. BUT SO I HAD TO PUSH THE -- I MEAN NOT BIG WARRANTS. YOU KNOW, LIKE DIDN'T PAY A A PARKING TICKET. SO I PUSHED THE BIKE IN THE BUSHES -- [ LAUGHTER ] AM I IN TROUBLE RIGHT NOW?
Jimmy: NO, I'M JUST TOTALLY -- I JUST LOVE HOW DIFFERENT OUR LIVES ARE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S FASCINATING. IT'S FASCINATING. I'M, LIKE, WATCHING "DRIVING MISS DAISY" AND YOU'RE RUNNING FROM THE COPS.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: WITH A WARRANT OUT FOR YOUR ARREST. YOU'RE SO COOL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, I JUST WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU.
WELL, I HAD TO PUSH THE BIKE IN THE BUSHES AND THEN --
Jimmy: OF COURSE. BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GET ARRESTED.
YEAH, AND THEN I WOBBLED TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE.
Jimmy: OH MY, OF COURSE YOU DID!
AND THEN --
Jimmy: A BROKEN LEG?
LANDED ON HIS SOFA -- LANDED ON HIS SOFA ALL SCRAPED UP, AND, WHILE I WAS LAYING ON THE GROUND, EVERYBODY WOULD DRIVE BY GOING, "SUE THEM, SUE THEM," BUT NOBODY STOPPED TO HELP ME. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Jimmy: SUE THE OLD PEOPLE?
WELL, YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA. EVERYBODY SUES EACH OTHER, I THINK, RIGHT? SO EVERYONE'S GOING, "SUE THEM."
Jimmy: INSTEAD OF HELPING YOU, THEY'RE LIKE, "SUE THOSE PEOPLE."
YEAH, HONK, HONK.
Jimmy: I DON'T WANT -- YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED WITH YOU.

Jimmy: HOW GREAT IS THAT MAN?
HE'S THE COOLEST GUY EVER. HE'S A BIG BIKER AND --
Jimmy: IS HE A BIG BIKER?
DUDE, I SAW HIM GO INTO A A BAR AND DO A COMEDY SHOW WHERE THERE'S A BUNCH OF SOUTHERN PEOPLE WHO ARE DRINKING, SORT OF HECKLING AND BEING CRAZY, AND HE TURNED THAT WHOLE ROOM INTO A LOVEFEST IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES. IT WAS -- I MEAN, THAT'S A A GIFT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THAT GUY HAS A GIFT.
Jimmy: HE'S TALENTED. HE'S A TALENTED DUDE.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, NO WAY. THAT'S SO FUN. IS THAT THE ONE THAT BILL MURRAY CAME TO OR NO.
WE STOPPED AND MET BILL MURRAY. IT WAS FUNNY BECAUSE I MET HIM AT "SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST." AND I SAID, "YEAH, FIRST TIME I MET YOU, YOU WERE WEARING A A DRESS AND YOU WERE RIDING A A DONKEY." AND HE GOES, "NO THAT WAS A A FULL-SIZE HORSE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT WAS THE PROBLEM WITH THE STORY? [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, YEAH, I WAS LIKE, "SORRY --"
Jimmy: THAT WAS HIS PROBLEM WITH THE STORY, IT WAS A FULL SIZE HORSE, IT WASN'T A DONKEY, YOU IDIOT.
THE WEIRDEST PART WAS WHEN I FIRST MET DAVE, SEAN HANNITY KEPT SENDING OVER TEQUILA SHOTS, WHICH WAS --
Jimmy: WHAT?
RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? SENDING -- WHERE WERE YOU -- WHERE DID YOU EAT? CAN YOU -- OH, YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY. SEAN HANNITY? HE WAS OUT EATING, NOT WITH YOU --
NOT WITH US BUT HE RAN INTO DAVE, AND I GUESS HE GEEKED OUT ON DAVE AND JUST KEPT SENDING THE TABLE TEQUILA SHOTS ALL NIGHT. IT WAS SO WEIRD, IT BECAME LIKE A RUNNING THING.
Jimmy: WOW, YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD? I SAW SEAN HANNITY AT A A RESTAURANT ONCE. HE DIDN'T SEND ME ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LET'S TALK ABOUT "THE WALKING DEAD." IT'S BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BETTER AND AWESOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW IT CAN GET BETTER. NEXT SEASON YOU YOU'RE GOING TO HIT 100 EPISODES, BUDDY. CONGRATULATIONS.

THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU! WOW. WOW. A LOT OF STRESSFUL THINGS GOING ON IN THE WORLD. I'M TRYING TO LEARN MEDITATION. AND -- I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES, AND WORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, NO. THAT'S MY MANTRA. "OH, NO." [?LAUGHTER ] EVERY TIME I LOOK AT THE NEWS, I FEEL LIKE MAYBE I NEED START DOOMSDAY PREPPING. I ORDERED A SURVIVAL KIT OFF THE INTERNET, WHICH I REALIZE IS THE LEAST SURVIVAL WAY TO GET A SURVIVAL KIT. [ LAUGHTER ] ONLINE WITH A GIFT CARD. [ LAUGHTER ] IT ARRIVED. IT'S A BACKPACK FULL OF EMERGENCY SUPPLIES. I'VE ALREADY EATEN TWO OF THE POWER BARS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE GOOD. I DON'T KNOW HOW THESE DOOMSDAY PREPPERS ARE RESISTING THE CONSTANT TEMPTATION OF DIPPING INTO THE BUNKER FRIDGE. OH, MAN, WE GOT TO MAKE A A GROCERY RUN, OR -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, WE GOT THAT CHICKEN CORDON BLEU IN A CAN. [ LAUGHTER ] IN THE OLD APOCALYPSE PANTRY. BUT I HAVE BAD EYESIGHT, THAT'S NO GOOD FOR SURVIVAL. I WEAR CONTACTS. AS SOON AS MY PRESCRIPTION RUNS OUT, I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE A A CANNIBAL HAPPY. [ APPLAUSE ] AND PEOPLE SAY YOU GOT TO GET LASIK. I'M NOT GETTING LASIK. I'M NOT PUTTING LASERS NEAR MY EYEBALLS. I HAVE AN EYE PHOBIA. AND MY THERAPIST SAYS FOR PHOBIA, ONE THING YOU CAN DO, IS GO THROUGH THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN AND IT'LL HELP WALK THROUGH YOUR FEAR. I WAS LIKE, "OKAY." I GUESS -- THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN WOULD BE THE LASERS -- I DON'T KNOW. EXPLODE MY EYEBALL? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I'M JUST BLIND FOREVER. I GUESS IT'S NOT THAT BAD. BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN THE WORST CASE. WORST CASE WOULD BE THAT I THEN SUE THE DOCTOR AND LOSE. HE COUNTER SUES. HE WINS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WORST CASE, I'M BLIND AND BROKE. I TRIP ON A DEAD BODY -- I'M LIKE, WAKE UP, COLD MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND NOW MY FINGERPRINTS ARE ALL OVER A DEAD BODY! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SENTENCED TO LIFE IN JAIL FOR A A CRIME I DIDN'T COMMIT. SO I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND I STILL DON'T WANT LASIK. [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE GET FALSELY ACCUSED ALL THE TIME. THAT'S THE ULTIMATE NIGHTMARE. THERE'S ALL OF THESE DOCUMENTARIES OUT ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. "MAKING OF A MURDERER," "SERIAL," "SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION." [ LAUGHTER ] AND OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS A A JURY OF 12 RANDOM PEOPLE. THAT'S CRAZY. EXCUSE ME. DO YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND THE LAW? NO. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY ARE YOU DECIDING IT? WE'RE BEING FORCED TO. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY SAID IF WE DIDN'T SHOW UP, WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO JAIL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO SOMETIMES WHEN I GET REALLY PARANOID, I'LL PLAY A GAME IN MY HEAD CALLED "CAN I PROVE WHERE I WAS AT YESTERDAY?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S FUN! YOU JUST PICK A TIME. SEE IF YOU CAN REMEMBER WHERE YOU WERE, AND THEN SEE IF YOU CAN PROVE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'LL PLAY "YESTERDAY." NOON. OKAY. I WAS HAVING LUNCH WITH A A BUDDY. THAT'S AN ALIBI AND PUT IT ON MY CREDIT CARD, "TIME STAMPED INNOCENT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ANYTIME I USE MY CREDIT CARD, I'M LIKE, BEEP, NOT GOING TO JAIL FOR WHATEVER JUST HAPPENED. [ LAUGHTER ] FEELS GOOD. THAT GAME GETS REALLY HARD THE LATER AT NIGHT THE TIME IS. LIKE 3:00 A.M. OH. THAT DOES SOUND LIKE A MURDER TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] 3:00 A.M., I WAS ASLEEP, ALONE. I TOOK NO LOVER. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S REALLY NO WAY TO PROVE IT. GUILTY AS CHARGED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CAN'T AFFORD TO SLEEP ALONE! WHICH IS A PRETTY GOOD PICK-UP LINE. HEY, WILL YOU COME HOME WITH ME TONIGHT? I'M AFRAID OF BEING CHARGED FOR MURDER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, THANK YOU! I'M JOE ZIMMERMAN AND I APPRECIATE IT. YOU GUYS ARE GREAT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
