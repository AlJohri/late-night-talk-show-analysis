HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. IN AN INTERVIEW THIS WEEK, JEB BUSH SAID THAT IF HE HAD A A MAGIC WAND, THERE ARE AT LEAST TEN THINGS THAT HE WOULD LIKE CHANGE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN JEB BUSH WAS GIVEN THE PRIZE FOR "LAMEST USE OF A A MAGIC WAND." [ LAUGHTER ] I COULD HAVE A LAMBORGHINI MADE OF GOLD, A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS. EDITS TO THE CONSTITUTION, OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF JEB BUSH, A NEW POLL SHOWS THAT HE IS NOW EVEN MORE UNPOPULAR THAN DONALD TRUMP. [ AUDIENCE GROANS ] [ LAUGHTER ] OR AS JEB PUT IT "WELL, AT LEAST THERE'S ONE POLL WHERE I'M AHEAD OF TRUMP." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. I'LL TAKE IT. THAT'S A WIN. [ APPLAUSE ] DID YOU SEE THIS? DONALD TRUMP HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH CNN IN THE LOBBY OF THE TRUMP TOWER HOTEL THIS WEEK, AND APPARENTLY SOMEONE YELLED, "YOU'LL NEVER WIN THE LATINO VOTE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN IMMEDIATELY, TRUMP HAD THE GUY DEPORTED OVER TO LA QUINTA HOTEL. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DEAL ABOUT THAT. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT GUY COULD STAND THERE. HE COULD BE ANYWHERE.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: TRUMP WAS ALSO RECENTLY QUOTED SAYING HE CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME HE APOLOGIZED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HIS BARBER SAID, WELL, I DEFINITELY REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I APOLOGIZED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "BEAUTIFUL." TRUMP ALSO SAID HE WOULDN'T RUN AS ANYONE'S VICE PRESIDENT IF HE LOSES THE NOMINATION. WHICH IS GOOD.

SOME INTERNATIONAL NEWS HERE, I SAW THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN WENT -- THIS GUY ALWAYS MAKING ME LAUGH.

[ APPLAUSE ] SOME TV NEWS, I SAW THAT A A WRITER WHO WORKED ON "WILL & GRACE" IS DEVELOPING A A SITCOM INSPIRED BY FACEBOOK. YEAH, IT'S CALLED "WOW, WILL AND GRACE GOT FAT."

IN FACT, I -- WHEN HE WAS A A PUPPY, I TOOK HIM TO THE VETERINARIAN TO SEE IF THERE WAS A REASON WHY HE WAS SLEEPING SO MUCH AND ASKING IF THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG, BECAUSE HE WILL WALK INTO A A ROOM, HE WILL HAVE A GOOD FIVE MINUTES OF BEING LIKE, EXCITED, AND THEN WHEN HE REALIZES NOTHING'S REALLY GOING TO CHANGE, YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE SOMEONE PUTTING A A BUNCH OF LUGGAGE DOWN.
Jimmy: YEAH. HOW TALL IS HE? PROBABLY MAYBE FOUR INCHES OFF THE GROUND?
HOW TALL IS HE? WHEN HE IS STANDING?

HE MIGHT BE A BUNNY. [ LAUGHTER ] HE IS -- BY THE WAY, THESE ARE TWO -- CAN YOU HOLD UP THE OTHER PICTURE?
Jimmy: YEAH OF COURSE.
THESE ARE ACTUALLY TWO SEPARATE DAYS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND IF YOU NOTICE, THESE ARE ACTUALLY -- I MEAN, NOTHING HAS CHANGED. THE PILLOW IS GONE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE DOESN'T MOVE. I LOVE HIM. AND YOU KNOW, WHEN WE MADE THIS MOVIE, LIKE, WE WOULD JUST SHOW UP AT THE SET EVERY DAY AND WE WOULD LET HIM WALK AROUND THE ROOM FOR A FEW SECONDS, SAY HI TO PEOPLE, AND THEN HE WOULD FALL ASLEEP. AND THEN WE WOULD SAY, "OKAY, SO I GUESS THIS IS WHERE WE'LL SHOOT THE SCENE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN WE WOULD JUST SHOOT THE SCENE AROUND HIM. AND SO HE KIND OF DIRECTED THE MOVIE INADVERTENTLY.
