Jimmy: HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. ANOTHER SETBACK FOR OUR PAL, TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD. [ LAUGHTER ] I HEARD THAT -- HE RECENTLY BROKE HIS PINKY TOE WHILE HE WAS WORKING OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED AND HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS. MAINLY, HOW'D YOU REALLY DO IT? "I TRIPPED ON A HOOKER." [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM HIS TOE WAS BROKEN, FORD LOOKED DOWN AND SAID, "I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT." FORD'S DOCTOR WROTE A A PRESCRIPTION FOR PAIN MEDS, BUT THEN THE PHARMACY SAID, "ACTUALLY, WE GET MOST OF OUR DRUGS FROM HIM, SO THIS USUALLY COMES IN ON WEDNESDAY, SO WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE. BUT IT'S PRETTY BIG NEWS OVER IN CANADA. IN FACT, THEY'VE ALREADY RELEASED AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE POPULAR CHILDREN'S RHYME, "THIS LITTLE PIGGY." TAKE A LOOK. IT NOW GOES -- "THIS LITTLE PIGGY WENT TO THE MARKET. THIS LITTLE PIGGY STAYED HOME. THIS LITTLE PIGGY HAD ROAST BEEF. AND THIS LITTLE PIGGY TOOK THE ROAST BEEF SANDWICH AND WENT TO WEE WEE WEE ALL THE WAY TO HIS SISTER'S BASEMENT TO SMOKE SOME CRACK." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY? THAT'S QUICK.
Jimmy: TOO LONG.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT FORD IS ACTUALLY -- HE'S STILL BUSY. HE'S CAMPAIGNING FOR RE-ELECTION. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WANTS TO GET RE-ELECTED. SO, HE'S OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING.

OH, MY GOSH.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO.
OH, MY!
BE CAREFUL. HOLD ON.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] HE REALLY DID THAT. EVEN WORSE, THAT GIRL SCREAMING, "OH, MY GOD." THAT'S HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH. AND FORD WAS LIKE, "THIS PLACE LOOKS A LOT DIFFERENT IN THE DAYTIME WHEN I'M NOT BUYING DRUGS." NO, NO, NO, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. THE MICROPHONE WAS ON. [ LAUGHTER ] LAST TIME ROB FORD CLIMBED SOMETHING, IT WAS THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. AND IT WAS JUST -- I SAW THAT THING AND I SWEAR, I THOUGHT I WAS WATCHING "CANADIAN NINJA WARRIOR."
Steve: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T REALLY THINK THAT.
Steve: YOU DIDN'T REALLY? [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON OVER IN WASHINGTON. THIS IS GOOD NEWS. PRESIDENT OBAMA JUST SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT BANS FEDERAL CONTRACTORS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST WORKERS FOR BEING GAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S GOOD. IT'S A HUGE, HUGE VICTORY FOR GAY PEOPLE. BUT WEIRD FOR THAT STRAIGHT GUY IN THE OFFICE WHO KEEPS GETTING CONGRATULATED. IT'S LIKE, "NO, I'M NOT!

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS -- IN A NEW INTERVIEW WITH NPR, REPUBLICAN SENATOR MARCO RUBIO SAID THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT A CANDIDATE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.

I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE IF ANYBODY REMINDS ME OF CENTURY 21, IT'S HILLARY CLINTON. AND JUST -- JUST MAYBE IT'S THE YELLOW BLAZERS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. MAYBE IT'S THE YELLOW.

A RACEHORSE OWNED BY QUEEN ELIZABETH HAS TESTED POSITIVE FOR A BANNED SUBSTANCE. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] OFFICIALS SAY IT'S EITHER STEROIDS OR WHATEVER'S HELPED THE QUEEN LIVE TO BE 188-YEARS-OLD. IT'S ONE OF THOSE TWO THINGS. IT'S A VERY SERIOUS STORY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS ISN'T GOOD. WALMART AND COSTCO ARE RECALLING 15,000 POUNDS OF FRUIT BECAUSE THEY COULD BE CONTAMINATED WITH DANGEROUS BACTERIA. YEP, 15,000 POUNDS OF UNWANTED FRUIT, OR AS THAT'S ALSO CALLED, AN EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. 15 MINUTES, THERE'S FLIES ALL OVER IT. YOUR NEPHEW'S LICKING THE CANTALOUPE ROSE. [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT THIS WAS VERY INTERESTING HERE. A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT HUMANS ARE GETTING OLDER AND FATTER THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE. WHICH, UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN, MEANS WE'RE WINNING? SOUNDS PRETTY GREAT, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] BILLBOARD, THAT'S THE GOAL, RIGHT? LIVE LONG, GET FAT, WHO CARES?
