IT'S A FUNNY THING  THAT HAPPENS HERE, BECAUSE I'VE  ACTUALLY MADE QUITE A FEW  MOVIES HERE. AND I'VE BEEN ARRESTED HERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I REMEMBER THAT. THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.
I RIDE MY BIKE AROUND HERE. SO IT'S SORT OF LIKE, I'M A A LITTLE BIT PART OF THE  FURNITURE. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT NEW YORK IS  THE CONVERSATIONS --
Jimmy: I FORGOT THAT.
--DOESN'T NECESSARILY  REQUIRE YOU. YOU KNOW? LIKE THERE'S A GUY WITH THE  FRUIT STALL DOWN THERE NEAR  TRIBECA KIND OF THING, YOU  KNOW? AND LIKE, HE SEES ME AND HE  GOES, "RUSSELL! HEY, HOW YOU DOING? YOU KNOW, MY WIFE, OH, MY GOD." [ LAUGHTER ] "SHE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY EVERY  DAY WITH THIS AND THAT AND  THIS. YOU KNOW, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I  GOT TO GO, I'M WORKING."

$2.50, THAT'S COOL.
Jimmy: CAN YOU GO TO ROME,  THOUGH? CAN YOU GO TO ROME? I MEAN, YOU'RE MAXIMUS. YOU'RE GLADIATOR.
THAT WAS THE FUNNIEST MOMENT  OF DISCOVERING FAME, YOU KNOW? OR UNDERSTANDING THAT I'VE  SUDDENLY BECOME FAMOUS. BECAUSE I WAS SO USED TO JUST  BEING ABLE TO WANDER AROUND AND  NOT WORRY ABOUT IT. I WAS IN ROME AND SHOPPING ON  THE VIA VENNETTO. I WENT INTO THE SHOP AND I CAME  OUT AND THE WHOLE STREET WAS  PACKED. I THOUGHT, "WHOA, WHAT'S GOING  ON?" YOU KNOW? I LOOKED THAT WAY AND IT WAS  PEOPLE UP TO THE SPANISH STEPS. I LOOKED THE OTHER WAY, THERE'S  JUST PEOPLES' HEADS EVERYWHERE,  YOU KNOW? AND THERE WAS ALL THESE, LIKE,  FEDERAL POLICE WITH MACHINE  GUNS ALL STANDING AROUND. I WAS LIKE, "WHOA." SO I WENT  UP TO ONE OF THEM, AND IN VERY  BROKEN ITALIAN I'M LIKE, "HEY,  WHAT'S GOING ON?" AND THE GUY GOES, "YOU,  GLADIATOR, YOU ARE GOING ON." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU, GLADIATOR. THEY'RE WATCHING YOU TO SEE  WHAT YOU DO THERE. BESIDES ACTING, YOU MUST HAVE  HAD A BUNCH OF OTHER JOBS  BEFORE.
LOTS AND LOTS. THAT'S THE THING. I WAS ALWAYS  BROUGHT UP WITH THAT MENTALITY  THAT YOU HAVE TO EARN YOUR WAY. YOU KNOW? SO I HAVE NEVER TAKEN ANY SORT  OF SOCIAL WELFARE PAYMENTS,  THOUGH I'M A GREAT BELIEVER IN  THAT.
Jimmy: YOU WERE -- WERE YOU  EVER BAD AT YOUR JOB?
MANY TIMES. I ENDED UP DOING SO MANY  DIFFERENT THINGS. IT WASN'T THAT I WAS  INTENTIONALLY CRAP. BUT YOU KNOW, I WAS WORKING FOR  THIS RENTAL CAR COMPANY IN THE  80s, AND THEY DECIDED THEY'RE  GOING TO HAVE A TOP END BECAUSE  EVERYBODY'S VERY  LIFESTYLE-FOCUSED IN THE 80s. SO THEY GOT THIS FLEET OF BRAND  NEW BMWs AND BRAND NEW MR2s,  THE TOYOTA SPORTS CAR. AND I WAS DRIVING A A $1,600 TOYOTA VAN WITH  200,000 KILOMETERS ON THE  CLOCK. THAT WAS MY RIDE.
Jimmy: THAT'S IT. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
AND SO DAY ONE, THESE BMWs  ARRIVE AND BECAUSE OF  CONSTRUCTION WHERE WE ACTUALLY  WERE DETAILING THE CARS, AND IN  CASE YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU CLEAN  THE CAR.
Jimmy: DETAILING, YEAH. THAT'S WHAT DETAILING IS.
IT'S A NAME FOR CLEANING THE  CAR.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S A CAR  WASH.
SO WE HAD TO TAKE THEM ON  THIS LIKE FOUR-BLOCK JOURNEY TO  GO TO A CAR WASH AND BRING IT  BACK.
Jimmy: I WOULD BE SCARED.
AND WHEN YOU GO TO THE CAR  WASH, THE PRINCIPLE THING THAT  YOU NEED TO DO, THE ONLY THING  YOU NEED TO AS THE DRIVER IS  MAKE SURE THE WINDOWS ARE UP  AND MAKE SURE THE CAR IS IN  PARK.
Jimmy: OH NO.
SO IT JUST GETS TAKEN. SO I'M GETTING OUT OF THIS CAR,  THINKING, "MAN, I MUST HAVE  LOOKED SO COOL DRIVING THOSE  FOUR BLOCKS IN THIS BEAUTIFUL  NEW CAR." AND JUST AS I'M SORT OF  STEPPING OUT, MY WHOLE BODY IS  OUT OF THE CAR AND IT'S MOVING,  YOU KNOW, IT'S ON THE CONVEYER. I LOOK BACK IN. AND IT'S IN DRIVE. NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD  HAPPEN IF A CAR GOES THROUGH A A CAR WASH IN DRIVE. I DON'T KNOW. BUT I JUST KNOW IT HAS TO BE,  IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE SAFE, IT  HAS TO BE IN PARK.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I JUMP  BACK IN, JUST STRETCH OVER, HIT  IT INTO PARK AND AS I'M COMING  OUT, THE FIRST ROLLER HITS THE  DOOR AND CATCHES ME RIGHT  BETWEEN THE CAR DOOR AND THE  ROOF, AND THEN IT'S LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE DOOR'S OPEN. SO THE LEATHER SEATS, THEY'RE  COVERED IN CRAP, THE CARPET'S  ALL COVERED IN CRAP, THE  STEREO'S GOT SOAP ALL OVER IT. BECAUSE THE JETS ARE GOING LIKE  STRAIGHT THOUGH THE GAP. HALFWAY THROUGH, WHEN THE  ROLLER RELEASED ME, I JUMPED  INTO THE CAR AND DID THE REST  OF THE JOURNEY.
Jimmy: NEVER ASKED BACK.
I REALLY WASN'T APPRECIATED  WHEN I GOT BACK.
Jimmy: I CAN SEE THAT, YEAH. BUT LOOK AT YOU NOW. LOOK AT YOU NOW. CONGRATS ON THIS MOVIE, BY THE  WAY, "THE WATER DIVINER." THE DIVINER IS WHEN, YOU KNOW,  SOME PEOPLE HOLD -- I REMEMBER  HEARING STICKS.
STICKS OR METAL RODS OR SOME  PEOPLE CAN JUST FEEL THE  PRESENCE OF WATER IN THEIR HAND  OR THEIR FEET OR WHATEVER. IT'S A REAL THING. AND WHEN YOU'RE IN COUNTRIES  LIKE AUSTRALIA, A LARGE PART OF  THE COUNTRY IS ARID. THESE GUYS CAN ACTUALLY FIND  WATER THAT'S POOLED UNDER THE  GROUND IN BETWEEN RAIN. IN SOME PARTS OF AUSTRALIA IT  WOULDN'T RAIN FOR THREE OR FOUR  YEARS AT A TIME.
Jimmy: REALLY?
AND SO THIS STORY FOLLOWS A A GUY CALLED JOSHUA WHO DOES  THAT FOR A LIVING. HE HAS THREE SONS AND THEY ALL  GO AWAY TO WAR, THE FIRST WORLD  WAR, AND THEY DON'T COME BACK. AND THAT GRIEF DRIVES HIS WIFE  TO MADNESS, AND SHE COMMITS  SUICIDE. SO NOW HE'S GOT ABSOLUTELY  NOTHING. SO BASED ON A GRAVESIDE  PROMISE, HE GOES HALFWAY ACROSS  THE WORLD TO A BATTLEFIELD  THAT'S FOUR YEARS COLD IN  SEARCH OF, ESENTIALLY, THE  BONES OF HIS CHILDREN.
Jimmy: IT IS A BEAUTIFUL  MOVIE AND IT'S BEAUTIFULLY  SHOT, BY THE WAY. IT'S JUST GORGEOUS. WHERE DID YOU FILM IT?
WE SHOT IN AUSTRALIA. WE DID OUR STUDIO WORK IN  SYDNEY, WE SHOT IN A BUNCH OF  DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN OUTBACK  SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Jimmy: UNBELIEVABLE. MAKES YOU WANT TO MOVE THERE.
ISTANBUL, SOUTHERN TURKEY. SO IT WAS A BIG ADVENTURE FOR A A FIRST TIME.
Jimmy: AND IT'S YOUR FIRST  TIME DIRECTING, SO WAS IT HARD  TO DIRECT YOURSELF? ARE YOU DIFFICULT? [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL I GOT THE AROUND THE  SUPPOSED REPUTATIONAL  DIFFICULTIES. I JUST DECIDED I'D DO SOMETHING  THAT I HAVEN'T DONE BEFORE. I SLEPT WITH THE DIRECTOR EVERY  NIGHT.
Jimmy: OH MY GOD! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS A SCANDAL.
AND HE COULD NOT KEEP HIS  HANDS OFF ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW  EVERYONE A CLIP. BY THE WAY, AND AGAIN, ANOTHER  CONGRATULATIONS. YOU WON ALL THE MAJOR AWARDS IN  AUSTRALIA ALREADY FOR THIS  MOVIE.
YEAH, IT WON WHAT THEY CALL  THE AUSTRALIAN ACADEMY OF THE  ACTOR AWARDS FOR BEST FILM. AND IT WON FIVE AUSTRALIAN FILM  CRITIC CIRCLE AWARDS.

YOU KNOW IF I'M UPSET --  LISTEN, THIS IS THE WAY I FEEL  ABOUT PUBLIC LIFE. IF YOU ARE UPSET ABOUT  SOMETHING, YOU NEED TO LET  PEOPLE KNOW THAT. IF YOU ARE ANGRY ABOUT  SOMETHING YOU SHOULD TELL THEM. IF YOU ARE HAPPY YOU SHOULD  TELL THEM. I MEAN, YOU SHOULDN'T BE HIDING  THINGS FROM PEOPLE. YOU WORK FOR THESE PEOPLE. SO, LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU  REALLY THINK. I HATE POLITICS WHERE PEOPLE  ARE LIKE PROGRAMMED ROBOTS. THEY ALL SOUND LIKE  CHARLIE BROWN'S TEACHER, RIGHT? WHAAA, WHAAA, WHAAA.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME. I'LL TELL YOU, THEY SAY A LOT  OF STUFF ABOUT ME, BUT THEY  WON'T SAY I SOUND LIKE  EVERYBODY ELSE. SO, I JUST AM GOING TO BE  MYSELF. THAT'S IT. IF PEOPLE LIKE IT, GREAT, AND  IF THEY DON'T, I CAN GET  ANOTHER JOB.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M  TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT I WANT. I WANT THIS TYPE OF GUY OUT  THERE YELLING AT PEOPLE. WE  LOVE HAVING YOU ON. THANK YOU FOR BEING A GOOD  SPORT.
