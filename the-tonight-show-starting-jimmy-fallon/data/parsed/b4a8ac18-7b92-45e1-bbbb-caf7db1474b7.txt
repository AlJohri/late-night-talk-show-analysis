Jimmy: DISNEY, FLORIDA.

Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IT IS, YEAH.
PEOPLE WERE STARING AT ME.
Jimmy: WAIT, THEY HAVE A HOT TUB AT DISNEYLAND? THAT'S AWESOME.

I WASN'T WITH MICKEY MOUSE. I WAS WITH LIKE HUMANS.
Jimmy: AT YOUR HOTEL.
YEAH. AT THE HOTEL. WE WENT TO RIDES PART OF THE TIME BUT MOSTLY HUNG OUT IN THE POOL BECAUSE IT IS WINTER IN NEW YORK.
Jimmy: THAT'S MY FAVORITE RIDE, THE EDIE FALCO HOT TUB.
I WAS MAKING A SPECIAL APPEARANCE IN THE EDIE FALCO HOT TUB RIDE, YES.
Jimmy: YOU ARE IN THE HOT TUB WITH A STRANGER.
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE, YES. A BUNCH OF STRANGERS, YEAH. AND MY DAUGHTER WHO IS NOT A A STRANGER. AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT ME AND THEY HE SAID, "I'M SO SORRY, BUT ARE YOU AN ACTRESS?" AND I SAID, "YEAH, YEAH I AM." AND THEY SAID, "OH, MY GOD I'M SUCH A BIG FAN." AND THEY STARTED TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND THE HUSBAND SAID, "I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS?" AND SHE SAID, "FELICITY HUFFMAN, OH, MY GOD." "DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES." AND THEN MY DAUGHTER LOOKED AT ME LIKE, "IS THAT YOUR NAME?"
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, I'M EDIE, I'M YOUR MOM.
SO, I SAID, "NO, THAT WASN'T ME."
Jimmy: YEAH, WELL YOU KIND OF RESEMBLE HER. AND EDIE AND FELICITY HUFFMAN.
OH YEAH, SURE.

I DON'T KNOW WHY I DO ANY OF THIS STUFF TO ME. I'M SORRY THAT WAS WAY MORE HONEST THAN I MEANT TO BE IN THIS VERY MOMENT. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ASKED ME HE TO THROW THE PITCH OUT.
Jimmy: I WAS JUST SO NERVOUS.
I WAS A NERVOUS WRECK, BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT WASN'T MY FIRST TIME. HOWEVER, WE HAD HEARD STORIES OF SOME OTHER PEOPLE WHO AS LONG AS IT WASN'T AS BAD AS BLANK --
