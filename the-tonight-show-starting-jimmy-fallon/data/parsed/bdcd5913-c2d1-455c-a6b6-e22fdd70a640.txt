WELL, WHAT I TRIED TO DO WAS, IN URBAN AMERICA, A LOT OF, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT RETAILERS, WERE NOT COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITY. SO YOU COULDN'T GET A SALAD IN URBAN AMERICA. YOU CAN GET FAST FOODS BUT YOU COULDN'T GET HEALTHY FOODS. YOU COULDN'T GET HEALTHY OPTIONS. SO WHAT I TRIED TO DO WAS BRING QUALITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE URBAN CONSUMER. SO IT STARTED OFF WITH MAGIC JOHNSON THEATERS. AND A MATTER OF FACT, WE BUILT THEM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THEN WE WENT TO STARBUCKS, BUILT THOSE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
Jimmy: MAGIC JOHNSON STARBUCKS?

Jimmy: YOU KNOW, I GOT YOU. I UNDERSTAND.
SO SWEET POTATO PIE --
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
POUND CAKE, SOCK IT TO ME CAKES, PEACH COBBLER. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, THE REASON IS BECAUSE, ALSO, WE DIDN'T HAVE MEETING PLACES BACK IN THAT TIME, AS WELL. SO THE STARBUCKS, THE FRIDAY'S, BECAME A MEETING PLACE FOR US TO MEET OUR FRIENDS AND THEN, REALLY, FRIDAY'S WAS BECAUSE, AGAIN, A LADY CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, "SON, I CAN'T GET A SALAD IN MY OWN COMMUNITY." WOULD YOU MIND INVESTING IN A RESTAURANT SO I COULD GET A SALAD? AND THAT'S HOW FRIDAY'S CAME ABOUT.
Jimmy: HAVE YOU EVER HAD A BAD INVESTMENT?

ACTUALLY, I'D STOPPED IN TEXAS, WHERE I'M FROM ON THE WAY HERE, AND MY -- MY MOM'S GOT A NEW THING WHERE NOW WHEN I GO VISIT SHE TRIES TO GIVE ME STUFF TO TAKE HOME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO SHE'LL BE LIKE, "HERE'S SOME OLD TROPHIES AND I FOUND SOME OLD SWEATERS. AND HERE'S SOME BOOKS." AND I SAID, "SO, ARE YOU AND DAD MOVING? LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHAT -- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?"
Jimmy: THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS. THIS IS THE DEAL. I KEEP MY STUFF HERE.
SHE'S TRYING TO LIKE GIVE ME MY MEMORIES TO TAKE ON THE ROAD. SO I SAID, LAST WEEK I SAID, "I CAN'T TAKE THIS STUFF. LIKE I GOT TO GO ON JIMMY FALLON." AND SHE'S LIKE, "NOW, WHO'S JIMMY FALLON?" [ AUDIENCE AWS ] AND NOW -- NOW, DON'T -- DON'T. I SAID -- I SAID YOU KNOW, "THE TONIGHT SHOW." YOU KNOW, JOHNNY CARSON -- WELL, HE'S THE -- THE JOHNNY CARSON NOW, LIKE, SHE DOESN'T -- SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHO -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT?
LIKE, I DID A MOVIE WITH ADAM SANDLER. SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO -- WHO ADAM WAS, AND SHE CAME ON THE SET AND SHE SAID, SHE WAS LIKE, "I MEAN, ADAM IS JUST SO FUNNY!" [ LAUGHTER ] AND I SAID, "YEAH, I MEAN, HE'S A COMEDY LEGEND." HE'S BUILT, LIKE, A COMEDY EMPIRE, BUT WE -- WE DID WATCH YOU, ME AND MY MOM WATCHED YOU LAST WEEK, AND SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] REALLY, REALLY.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE YOU! I DON'T KNOW, YOU'RE A GOOD ACTOR, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT ONE, THOUGH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE WATCHED --
Jimmy: DOES SHE NOT -- DOES SHE NOT HAVE A TV?
NO, SHE HAS A TV, BUT, YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: IS SHE NOT UP THIS LATE?
NO, SHE WASN'T UP THAT LATE. SO, WE WATCHED THE -- THE MONOLOGUE. AND SHE SAID "HE'S GREAT. HE'S REALLY CHARMING AND FUNNY." AND IT WAS THE NIGHT SETH MEYERS WAS ON.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. HE WAS GREAT TOO.
I SAID, SO THESE GUYS ARE GREAT TOGETHER, HUH? AND I LOOKED OVER, AND SHE WAS OUT.
Jimmy: SHE WAS SLEEPING. [ LAUGHTER ] OR JUST OUT OF THE ROOM?
NO, NO, NO. SHE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP.
Jimmy: SHE JUST CONKED OUT.
SHE JUST DRIFTED OFF.
Jimmy: I HAVE THAT EFFECT PEOPLE.
VERY, VERY, VERY PEACEFULLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I HAVE THAT EFFECT -- WHAT IS YOUR MOM'S NAME?
LAURA.
Jimmy: LAURA WILSON -- [ LAUGHTER ] COME BACK TO US. COME BACK TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW." WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH. YOUR SON IS DOING SO WELL, AND YOU GOT TO WATCH THE SHOW MORE OFTEN. IF ANYONE -- YEAH.
WELL, YOU GOT A NEW FAN NOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, I'M HAPPY. THAT'S GOOD.
YEAH. BEFORE -- BEFORE YOU SPOKE TO HER, BUT EVEN -- EVEN NOW. NOW SHE'S REALLY GOING TO LOVE YOU.
Jimmy: OH, GOOD. ALL RIGHT, GOOD. I WANT -- MOMS SHOULD LOVE ME. YEAH, I LIKE THAT. I'M ON THE MOM'S SIDE ALL THE TIME. I GOT TO TALK ABOUT "ROCK DOG." CONGRATS ON THIS. THIS IS A GOOD FUN FAMILY MOVIE.
THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHO -- WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SEE A CARTOON DOG -- A SINGING CARTOON DOG? IT'S SO FUNNY. YOU ROCKED OUT. AND IT'S JUST -- IT'S GREAT.
YEAH, IT'S -- IT'S LIKE THE FIRST TIME MY NIECE AND NEPHEWS HAVE EVER SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: REALLY?
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE, YOU WALK INTO THE ROOM, AND SAY HEY -- IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT EXCITED TO SEE YOU, THEY JUST -- HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN SEEING YOU. BUT NOW, IT'S LIKE, "HEY, WHEN'S "ROCK DOG" COME OUT? LIKE, CAN YOU GET ME A TICKET?"
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU'VE NEVER DONE A FAMILY FILM BEFORE?
I DONE -- I DID THIS MOVIE "MY DOG SKIP" WHICH WAS LIKE A KIDS' MOVIE. I WAS, ACTUALLY, AT THE PREMIERE OF "MY DOG SKIP" BUT WHEN THEY HAVE KIDS MOVIES THEY'LL HAVE PREMIERES LIKE EARLY ON SATURDAY MORNINGS AT LIKE 11:00. AND THE "MY DOG SKIP" PREMIERE WAS GREAT. TONS OF LITTLE KIDS, THEY WERE ALL LAUGHING, ALL LOVED THE MOVIE, AND THEN THE MOVIE ENDED AND SKIP DIES AT THE END. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] UM -- AND IT WAS -- IT WAS -- BUT IT ENDED AND IT WAS DEAD SILENCE IN THE THEATER, AND I THOUGHT, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN HERE? AND IT WAS JUST LITTLE KIDS CRYING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS -- THIS IS TERRIBLE!
IT WAS LIKE, YOU AND I WHEN WE SAW "SOUNDER." OR LIKE "OLD YELLER."
Jimmy: "OLD YELLER," YEAH.
BUT AT THE PARTY, THEY -- THEY ALL CAME ROARING BACK.
Jimmy: BUT -- WE SHOULD LET EVERYONE KNOW, THIS -- THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THIS FILM.
NO. "ROCK DOG" DOES NOT DIE.
Jimmy: NO, HE DOES NOT. IT'S VERY -- VERY HAPPY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE CAN'T! THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER "ROCK DOG."
Jimmy: UNLESS THERE WON'T BE "ROCK DOG 2." YEAH, EXACTLY. NO, IT IS ACTUALLY -- NO, IT'S SUPER FUN AND, IT'S -- WHO'S VOICE OF THE YEAR? AND THEY GO --
J.K. SIMMONS.
Jimmy: J.K. SIMMONS, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS HIM OR WAS IT SAM --
SAM ELLIOTT'S IN IT.
Jimmy: SAM ELLIOT'S VOICE. I GO, "OH, MY GOSH."
AND EDDIE IZZARD.
Jimmy: EDDIE IZZARD'S FANTASTIC AS WELL. THERE'S GOOD SONGS IN IT AS WELL. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S LUKE WILSON AND J.K. SIMMONS IN THE ANIMATED MOVIE "ROCK DOG." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WHERE DID YOU -- DID YOU BREAK INTO THE -- AH. MY SON THE THIEF.
I -- I KNOW. I'M SORRY. BUT SEE, THERE'S THIS GUY NAMED ANGUS, AND HE WAS TELLING ME ABOUT ROCK 'N' ROLL PARK, AND FINDING MY BAND, AND IT WAS LIKE THE ANSWER OF THE QUESTION OF MY LIFE, DAD. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET A NEW LOCK. LIKE THOSE THINGS GROW ON TREES AROUND HERE.
IF YOU COULD FEEL WHAT I'M FEELING -- HERE! ♪♪
GIVE ME THE -- BODI! SON, GIVE ME THAT! GIMME! [ CRASHING ] ♪♪ NOW WHEN YOU'VE COME TO YOUR SENSES, YOU'RE GOING TO MARCH DOWN HERE AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAND OVER THAT NOISEMAKER AND WE'RE GOING TO PRETEND THIS NEVER HAPPENED.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO, RIGHT THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LUKE WILSON, EVERYBODY! "ROCK DOG" IS IN THEATERS FEBRUARY 24th. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH STAND UP FROM ROY WOOD JR. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

WOW. DAMN! IT'S -- IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE KNOW EACH OTHER. I NEEDED THAT. MY SELF-ESTEEM NEEDED THAT. [ CHEERS ] I LOST AN ARGUMENT WITH MY GIRL OVER LIGHT BULBS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T -- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW LIGHT BULBS WAS SOMETHING YOU COULD ARGUE ABOUT, BUT I LOST! [ LAUGHTER ] TRYING TO DECORATE THE HOUSE, AND APPARENTLY THE NEW THING WITH LIGHT BULBS, I DID NOT KNOW THIS, BUT NOW THE NEW THING WITH LIGHT BULBS IS YOU JUST HANG A SINGLE LIGHT BULB FROM A STRING FROM YOUR CEILING. JUST A NAKED LIGHT BULB, JUST HANGING -- JUST A HANGING NAKED LIGHT BULB, AND SHE WAS LIKE, DOESN'T IT LOOK NICE? IT LOOKED LIKE POVERTY. I'M GOING TO BE REAL WITH YA. ALL RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT -- LIKE POVERTY. I -- I WALK IN MY HOUSE, IT LOOK LIKE THE FIRST WU-TANG VIDEO. THAT'S NOT THE LOOK I'M GOING FOR. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT WHAT I WANT. I WENT TO COLLEGE. SO, I COULD AFFORD LIGHTS THAT'S ATTACHED TO STUFF. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE MOVED IN. I LOSE THE THERMOSTAT BATTLES TOO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HALF THE RELATIONSHIP IS JUST ME WAITING FOR HER TO LEAVE THE ROOM SO I CAN CHANGE THE THERMOSTAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S IT. THE THERMOSTAT, SHE ALWAYS GOT IT ON 80, AND YOU -- YOU JUST GO BACK AND FORTH. AND THAT'S WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT -- THAT YOUR PARENTS LIED TO YOU. YOUR PARENTS LIED TO YA. WHEN -- WHEN THEY TOLD US WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK FOR IN A MATE, THEY GAVE US THE WRONG LIST. THAT LIST WAS HORRIBLE. FIND SOMEONE THAT RESPECTS YOU. AND WHO -- WHO HAS AMBITION, AND WATCH HOW THEY TREAT A WAITRESS, BECAUSE HOW THEY TREAT A WAIT -- NO. FIND YOU SOMEBODY YOU THERMOSTATICALLY COMPATIBLE WITH. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PUT IT AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST. THERMOSTATIC COMPATIBILITY SHOULD BE ABOVE RELIGION. A CATHOLIC CAN DATE A CHRISTIAN, BUT A 82 CAN'T DATE A 67. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ARE YOU CRAZY? [ APPLAUSE ] IT WILL NEVER WORK! NOT EVEN WITH A SPACE HEATER. YOU'RE FORCING IT. JUST LET HER GO. SHE AIN'T FOR YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] GOTTA LET IT GO. I SHOP. I TRY TO SHOP ONLINE NOW, BECAUSE THE CASHIERS KEEP ASKING ME ABOUT THESE DISCOUNT CARDS, IN THE STORE. I DON'T HAVE THE DISCOUNT CARDS. OKAY? JUST -- JUST LET ME GO. I WANT TO LEAVE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] JUST RING UP MY STUFF. LET ME LEAVE. I WANT TO LEAVE SO BAD, I'D RATHER PAY FULL PRICE. THAT'S HOW BAD I WANT TO LEAVE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEY GRILL YOU ABOUT THE CARD. WELL, DO YOU -- DO YOU HAVE THE DISCOUNT CARD? HERE'S A FAVORITE QUESTION. WHY I GOT TO HAVE CARD TO GET A DISCOUNT? WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ALWAYS GIVE US THE CHEAPEST PRICE? WHY DO I HAVE TO -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LIKE -- WE -- WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO JOIN THE GROCERY STORE ILLUMINATI TO GET 10% OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T NEED THAT. I APPRECIATE THE HOSPITALITY, BUT SOME PEOPLE JUST OVERDO IT. SOME COMPANIES OVERDO IT. I WENT ON A CRUISE. TOO MUCH HOSPITALITY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I MET THE CAPTAIN OF THE BOAT. THAT'S UNNECESSARY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S UNNECESSARY. AT NO POINT DURING MY CRUISE DO I NEED TO MEET THE HIGHEST RANKING PERSON ON THE VESSEL! I'M AT THE POOL, AND HE'S WALKING, HE'S GOT HIS JACKET AND HE'S SASHAYING AROUND AND -- "WELCOME ABOARD. I AM THE CAPTAIN. ARE YOU HAVING PLEASURE?" UH, WHO DRIVING RIGHT NOW? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GO BACK TO THE STEERING WHEEL. WE IN THE OCEAN. ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. THIS WHERE GODZILLA LIVES. BRO, THIS IS CRAZY! [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DOING U-TURNS IN THE OCEAN -- LIKE A CRUISE IS SO WEIRD. IT MAKES YOU APPRECIATE AIRLINE PILOTS. I HAVE NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR AIRLINE PILOTS NOW, BECAUSE THEY DON'T TALK TO YOU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT THEIR JOB. IT'S THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS' JOB TO SAY HELLO. THE AIRLINE PILOT AIN'T GOT TIME TO TALK TO YOU. HE'S BUSY, HE TRYING TO MAKE SURE HE DOES HIS JOB PROPERLY. YOU LOOK IN THE COCKPIT, YOU GET ON THE PLANE. WHAT YOU SEE? TWO PEOPLE NERVOUS, CHECKING BUTTONS. THAT'S ALL YOU SEE. THAT'S ALL YOU SEE IN THE COCKPIT. TWO PEOPLE TRYING NOT TO LOSE THEIR JOB. [ LAUGHTER ] "DID YOU CHECK ALL OF THE BUTTONS?" [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE WE CAN'T LEAVE 'TIL WE CHECK ALL THE -- YOU GOT TO CHECK THE BUTTONS UP HERE, AND THEN WE CHECK THE BUTTONS DOWN HERE. JUST -- THE STARTER. "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE'S GOING TO BE A DELAY." [ LAUGHTER ] "WE GOTTA RECHECK THESE BUTTONS. THANK FOR CHOOSING" -- I DON'T NEED THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LIKE -- LIKE, I HONESTLY DON'T NEED THE CAPTAIN OF THE FLIGHT WALKING DOWN THE AISLE CHECKING ON ME. JUST FLY THE PLANE, MAN. WE COOL. I DON'T NEED YOU SASHAYING -- "WELCOME ABOARD. WE ARE FLYING. DO YOU SEE? WE HAVE WI-FI. ARE YOU HAVING PLEASURE? IN THE SKY?" [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE CAPTAIN GETS IT RIGHT. NOBODY DOES IT BETTER THAN A -- THAN A AIRPLANE CAPTAIN. BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT'S NOT TIME TO SAY, HELLO, BEFORE THE FLIGHT. HE KNOWS TO WAIT 'TIL AFTER THE FLIGHT, AFTER THE JOB IS DONE. THAT'S WHEN HE STARTS COMING OUT SAYING, HELLO, BECAUSE HE'S EARNED IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST FLEW YOU 500 MILES AN HOUR AT 30,000 FEET AND LANDED SAFELY ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT. HELL YEAH! I'M GOING TO COME OUT AND SAY HELLO. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHO I AM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S -- THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU GET OFF THE PLANE, THE CAPTAIN IS STANDING IN THE DOOR LIKE A BOSS. HE LIKE, "WHAT'S UP? YOU SAW THAT?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE COPILOT'S NEXT TO HIM. "I CHECKED THE BUTTONS. HOW YOU DOING?" THANK Y'ALL SO MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT. THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT RIGHT THERE. ROY WOOD JR.! HIS COMEDY SPECIAL, "FATHER FIGURE" PREMIERES THIS SUNDAY ON COMEDY CENTRAL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY! WOW! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
