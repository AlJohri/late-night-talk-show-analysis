"ROGUE NATION" IN THEATERS AND IMAX. I RECOMMEND IMAX IF YOU CAN. IF YOU CAN'T, A THEATER IS JUST AMAZING. IT IS WALL TO WALL NONSTOP. AMAZING LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO. THERE'S NO ONE DOING IT LIKE YOU'RE DOING IT. YOU'RE HANGING OFF THE SIDE OF THE PLANE AND I'VE SEEN THIS ON THE NEWS, BUT YOU REALLY DID IT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU COULD PUT LIKE A DUMMY ON THERE, A MANNEQUIN AND THEN HAVE A WIDE SHOT AND GO, OH, YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.
I KNOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DID IT.
YEAH, WE DID IT.
Jimmy: AND HOW MANY TAKES DID YOU DO?
WE DID EIGHT TAKES.
Jimmy: IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE STORY, THERE'S A GIANT CARGO PLANE.
A-400 AIRBUS.
Jimmy: I MEAN, MAJOR PLANE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FIRST OF ALL, I'M AFRAID OF THE PLANE. I WOULDN'T EVEN GO ON THE PLANE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE HANGING OFF THE SIDE OF IT. I'M NOT SPOILING IT FOR EVERYBODY. IT'S IN THE TRAILER. AND IT TAKES OFF.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HOW FAST CAN YOU COME DOWN? LIKE SAY YOU GO UP.
YOU KNOW, THEY STRAPPED ME ON THE SIDE OF THE PLANE BEFOREHAND. THEN THEY START THE ENGINE. THEN WE TAXI. THEN WE GO DOWN THE RUNWAY. AND I REMEMBER TELLING THE PILOT, I SAID LISTEN -- I GOT TO WORK WITH A TEST-PILOT. I'M A PILOT. I LOVE FLYING AIRPLANES.
Jimmy: SURE.
I'M LIKE, LOOK, THE ANGLE OF ATTACK, I WANT TO MAKE SURE MY LEGS ARE HITTING AGAINST THE FUSELAGE. HE'S JUST KIND OF SMILING AT ME THE WHOLE TIME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, "REALLY, I NEED MY LEGS TO HIT THE FUSELAGE BECAUSE WE SET THE CAMERA UP ON THE AIRPLANE. SO YOU SEE THE GROUND GOING AWAY." HE SAID, "OH YEAH, THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM." THEN THE FIRST TAKE WE'RE GOING DOWN THE RUNWAY AND IT WAS EVERYTHING TO KEEP MY FEET ON THE STEPS BECAUSE I WAS ALMOST SLAPPED AGAINST THE FUSELAGE GOING DOWN THE RUNWAY WE WERE GOING SO FAST. IT WAS A LITTLE INTENSE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING AND -- THERE GOING, MAYBE THIS WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TOO LATE NOW. I CAN'T TELL EVERYBODY. I GOT THE WHOLE CREW ON THE PLANE.
Jimmy: I'M SO HAPPY I'M A A LATE NIGHT TV TALK SHOW HOST. I'M SO HAPPY. I LOVE MY DESK. [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVE MY JOB SO MUCH. I MEAN, BUT YOU'RE GETTING HIT WITH JET FUEL?
JET FUEL AND, YOU KNOW. I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GET HIT BY A BIRD OR ANY PARTICLES, YOU KNOW. THAT WOULD BE BAD. SERIOUSLY, I GOT HIT BY A A LITTLE STONE ABOUT THAT BIG. WE WERE GOING SO FAST, LUCKILY IT HIT MY RIB. I THOUGHT IT BROKE MY RIB, WHEN I WAS ON THE SIDE. I WAS JUST THINKING, THANK GOD IT DIDN'T HIT MY FACE. I DIDN'T TELL MY FAMILY OR FRIENDS OR ANYONE I WAS DOING IT BEFOREHAND. BUT, LOOK I DO IT BECAUSE IT'S ENTERTAINING TO YOU ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW? I WANT TO ENTERTAIN YOU.
Jimmy: I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO FIND OUT.
I WANT TO ENTERTAIN YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME. YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME. BUT THEN YOU DO THIS THING WHERE ALSO WHERE YOU'RE ALSO UNDER WATER -- AND AGAIN, I'M NOT SPOILING ANYTHING. IT'S "MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE," SO YOU'RE UNDERWATER AND FLYING OFF A PLANE. SOME OF THE BEST STUNTS I'VE EVER SEEN. AND GREAT CAST AS ALWAYS. WE LOVE SIMON PEGG. AND SO, YOU'RE UNDER WATER AND CRACKING THIS TYPE OF SECURITY SYSTEM THING. BUT YOU ACTUALLY WENT -- YOU DID TRAINING TO HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR SIX MINUTES?
YEAH. OVER SIX MINUTES FOR FREE DIVING. SO THAT -- BECAUSE THE TAKES ARE REALLY LONG. IT'S THE LONGEST, YOU KNOW, UNDERWATER SEQUENCE I'VE EVER DONE. THE WAY THE DIRECTOR DID IT, IT WAS LIKE I HAD TO HOLD -- YOU HAD TO TRAIN BEYOND IT, BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO TO SHOOT I HAVE TO TAKE THE REGULATOR OUT, GET ON THE SIDE OF THE SET UNDER WATER, THEN THE CAMERA COMES IN PLACE. AND THEN WE CALL ACTION. THEN IT'S JUST VERY LONG TAKES. YOU'LL SEE IN THE MOVIE THEY'RE JUST REALLY, REALLY LONG TAKES. WE WANTED TO DO IT PRACTICAL.
Jimmy: I MEAN, THAT'S GOT TO -- THAT'S GOT TO SCREW UP YOUR SYSTEM, DOESN'T IT?
IT WAS DEATHFUL.
Jimmy: DID YOUR BODY GO, HEY, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, DUDE? [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: CAN YOU JUST CHILL OUT?
GOING FROM THE AIRPLANE -- IT WAS ALSO COLD IN THE AIRPLANE. SO IT WAS FREEZING UP THERE.

OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU GAVE ME A NICE LITTLE --
THERE'S NO WAY TO PLUG FOR MY BOOK. IT'S JUST SENTIMENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, IT'S BOTH. IT'S BOTH.
THIS MAN WHO HAD EARLIER NOTHING TO DO AT ALL BUT GET OUT OF ONE TELEVISION SHOW AND GET INTO ANOTHER ONE, WHICH IS A 48-HOUR JOB, FOUND TIME TO WRITE A BRILLIANT FORWARD TO MY BOOK. AND YOU MENTIONED HOW WHEN I CALLED YOU BEFORE YOUR OTHER TELEVISION SHOW.
Jimmy: YOU WERE THE FIRST PHONE CALL I GOT WHEN I GOT "LATE NIGHT." AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT. THEY GO, "DICK CAVETT IS CALLING." I GO, "THE DICK CAVETT?" IT WAS SO COOL. YOU GAVE ME GREAT ADVICE. AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'M HERE.
THIS IS NOT A PLUG EITHER, BUT YOUR NAME IS OF COURSE ON THE COVER.
Jimmy: YOU KEEP PLUGGING THIS BOOK.
NO. NO.
Jimmy: NOT PLUGS.
I WANTED YOUR NAME TO BE BIGGER THAN MINE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG.
AND IF YOU BELIEVE THAT --
Jimmy: NO, EXACTLY. I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT.
I KIND OF THINK OF YOU AS THE SON I NEVER HAD.
Jimmy: AWW.
AT LEAST ONE OF THEM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DID GET AROUND. HEY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FILM. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTARY.
IT'S A STUNNING DOCUMENTARY. I CAN'T SAY IT'S MINE. I'M IN IT.
Jimmy: NO. YOU'RE IN IT. BUT YOU KNEW THE CHARACTERS VERY WELL.
YES. FOR YOUR 1849 FANS THEY PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY AND GORE VIDAL. BUT THESE WERE TWO BRILLIANT WASP-ISH, BRILLIANT MEN, EXTREME RIGHT, EXTREME LEFT, WITTY, COLORFUL, DANGEROUS. ABC HIRED THEM TO COMMENT ON THE '69 CONVENTION, WHICH I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER WELL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT GOT REALLY BAD. THEY STARTED CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES. IT GOT FUNNY.
Jimmy: IT'S FANTASTIC.
IT IS. IT'S A PISSER AS MY AUNT USED TO SAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I LOVE YOUR AUNT.
AUNT ESTER ALWAYS SAID THAT.
Jimmy: NOW YOU SEE -- PEOPLE SEE PEOPLE FIGHTING ON TV ALL THE TIME, NOW. YOU KNOW, REALITY SHOWS AND WHATNOT.
JIMMY --
Jimmy: BACK IN THE TIME WHEN NO ONE WAS DOING THAT.
THIS IS WHERE IT WAS BORN. IT'S NEVER LIVED UP TO THIS AGAIN. AND HERE IS A MOMENT THAT SHOWS HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER, I THINK YOU COULD SAY. AND IT'S -- THE OPERATIVE WORD IS IN THIS SENTENCE, CALL ME A A CRYPTO NAZI. WATCH FOR THAT. IT'S RIGHT AT THE TOP.
Jimmy: HERE'S A CLIP FROM "BEST OF ENEMIES." TAKE A LOOK.
I KNOW YOU DON'T --
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THE ONLY CRYPTO NAZI I CAN THINK OF IS YOURSELF. FEELING THAT --
LISTEN, YOU --
STOP CALLING ME A CRYPTO NAZI. LET'S STOP CALLING NAMES. LET'S STAY PLASTERED.
GENTLEMEN, LET'S GO.
GO BACK TO HIS PORNOGRAPHY AND STOP MAKING ANY ILLUSIONS OF --
I BEG YOU TO --
