Steve: THEY DID IT!
Jimmy: WE CAN DO IT!
Steve: YAY!
Jimmy: WE CAN DO IT!
Steve: I KNEW THEY COULD DO IT.
Jimmy: IT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING BUT TROUBLE FOR THE PRESIDENT. REPUBLICANS ALSO SLAMMED OBAMA'S NEW REGULATIONS ON POWER PLANTS BY TELLING HIM TO QUOTE, "TAKE HIS GOLF CAP OFF AND GET HIS HARD HAT ON." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THEY SAW THIS AND THEY SAID, "YOU KNOW, MAYBE PUT THE GOLF HAT BACK ON. THAT JUST LOOKS WEIRD." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CHECK THIS OUT.

OH! [ GIGGLES ] I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE. [ CHEERS ] THANK YOU. IF ONLY TO JUST PROVE ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT I AM NOT QUESTLOVE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS ] [ LAUGHTER ] GLAD WE GOT THAT STRAIGHT. HI, NEW YORK. YOU'RE A TOUGH CITY. OH, I DON'T MEAN THAT AS A A COMPLIMENT. MORE LIKE, "HEY, CALM DOWN. REMEMBER, ICE CREAM DOES EXIST. YOU COULD HAVE IT ANY TIME YOU LIKE. AND IF IT'S A REALLY TOUGH DAY, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL FOR YOU TO JUST KISS A PUPPY ON ITS BUTT." [ LAUGHTER ] I DO LIKE YOUR SUMMERS HERE, NEW YORK. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE THE SUMMER. I'M A SUMMERTIME BOY. [ LAUGHTER ] MY FAVORITE TIME TO JUST RELAX, SMOKE A LITTLE POT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S MY SUMMER THING. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S ALSO MY WINTER THING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS ] AND IT'S CREEPIN' IN ON FALL. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I'M OFTEN A VERY STRESSED OUT PERSON.

[ LAUGHTER ] [ GIGGLES ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I BEEN RELAXING MORE. I BEEN TRYING TO MEDITATE. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON MY DREAM BOARD, JUST WRITING OUT MY HOPES AND DREAMS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHY IS THAT FUNNY TO YOU? [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK IT'S BRAVE OF ME. [ LAUGHTER ] TAKE MY HOPES AND DREAMS OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE. WRITE THEM DOWN. SAY, "THIS IS WHAT I WANT, UNIVERSE. BRING IT TO ME." THAT'S BRAVE. I DID FIND OUT THAT MOST OF MY DREAMS ARE JUST TO OWN A A TEMPURPEDIC MATTRESS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ GIGGLES ] I JUST DON'T HANDLE STRESS WELL. IT COULD BE LITTLE THINGS. LIKE DEALING WITH COPS. [ LAUGHTER ] OR GOING TO THE DMV. OR SEEING IDENTICAL TWINS WHEN YOU DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S TERRIFYING. WHY DO WE LIVE WITH THAT? WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SNOWFLAKES. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN, THERE'S A DIRECT COPY OF ONE OF US, AND WE DON'T STAB IT IN THE SKULL? [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH DEMONS AND DOPPELGANGERS. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY, I'M WILLING TO ADMIT, THAT'S A STRONG STANCE ON TWINS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ GIGGLES ] BUT WEIRD THINGS ALWAYS BOTHER ME. LIKE, WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO PROVE TO A ROBOT THAT I'M NOT A A ROBOT? [ LAUGHTER ] WHY DO YOU CARE? WHO PUT YOU UP TO THIS, ROBOT? AND HOW DO YOU WANT ME TO PROVE IT? WITH A CAPTCHA? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BY ENTERING IN A SERIES OF RANDOM LETTERS AND NUMBERS INTO MY COMPUTER? THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING A A ROBOT WOULD BE PRETTY GOOD AT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T GO UP TO MY TOASTER AND BE, LIKE, "HEY, PROVE TO ME YOU'RE NOT MY FRIEND CRAIG RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE CRAIG-LIKE TO ME. EVEN ACTING LIKE CRAIG. TURNING MY BREAD INTO TOAST. THAT'S ONE OF CRAIG'S FAVORITE THINGS." OH, THAT IS YOU, CRAIG? [ LAUGHTER ] SORRY I PUT THAT BREAD IN YOU, DOG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
