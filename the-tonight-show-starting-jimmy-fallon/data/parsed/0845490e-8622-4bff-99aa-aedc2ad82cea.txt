Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THIS IS IT. YOU'RE PART OF THE SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS EXCITING. YOU'RE HERE. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
GOOD.
Jimmy: NICE TO SEE YOU. HE WANTS TO SAY HI TO EVERYBODY. HE MADE IT. YOU MADE IT. HERE HE IS. HE'S HERE. HERE HE IS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOOD TO SEE YOU. FIND OUT THAT GUY'S NAME LATER. FIND OUT THAT GUY'S NAME. FANTASTIC. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO START OFF BY WISHING EVERYBODY A HAPPY NEW YEAR, AND THANK YOU SHOW MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I APPRECIATE THAT. I KNOW A LOT OF YOU ARE A A LITTLE SORE TODAY AFTER GOING TO THE GYM FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE LAST JANUARY. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I APPRECIATE IT. I KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORK. [ APPLAUSE ] AS WE START OFF THE NEW YEAR, THE ELECTION IS ON EVERYONE'S MIND. AND GET THIS, ACCORDING TO A A NEW POLL, DONALD TRUMP WAS THE CANDIDATE AMERICANS WOULD LEAST WANT TO HAVE AS THEIR NEIGHBOR. [ LAUGHTER ] IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE HE'D BUILD A MASSIVE WALL BETWEEN YOUR YARDS AND MAKE YOU PAY FOR IT. HE'S LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] "YOUR TREE'S GROWING OVER MY WALL." ACTUALLY ON "FACE THE NATION" YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP ACCUSED TED CRUZ OF COPYING HIS IMMIGRATION REFORM PLAN, SPECIFICALLY HIS IDEA OF BUILDING A GIANT WALL. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN CHINA SAID, "AH, HELLO, I THINK WE KIND OF INVENTED THAT WHOLE WALL THING." [ APPLAUSE ] AND SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SUSPENDED HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OVER THE HOLIDAY. SO IN HONOR OF LINDSEY LEAVING THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF HIS GREATEST HITS.
MAYBE WE NEED TO DRINK MORE IN WASHINGTON. IF I'M PRESIDENT, WE'RE GONNA DRINK MORE. THAT'S THE FIRST THING I'M GONNA DO AS PRESIDENT. WE GON' DRINK MORE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M 60, I'M NOT MARRIED, I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DRINK UP, LINDSEY. DRINK UP, BUDDY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S A GOOD GUY. AND GET THIS, IN A RECENT INTERVIEW ON NPR'S "MORNING EDITION", PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THE QUESTION HE WOULD WANT TO ASK CANDIDATES IS WHY THEY WANT TO BE PRESIDENT. A FEW OF THE CANDIDATES ACTUALLY RESPONDED. CHECK OUT WHEY THEY HAD TO SAY HERE. BERNIE SANDERS SAYS, "I WANT TO BRING BACK MORE ECONOMIC EQUALITY." TED CRUZ SAID, "I WANT TO STOP GOVERNMENT OVERREACH." AND HILLARY CLINTON SAID, "I HAVE A LIST OF NAMES. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE THE NAMES OF EVERY PERSON WHO HAS EVER CROSSED ME. FRIENDS, RELATIVES. SOME KNOW WHO THEY ARE. SOME WON'T KNOW UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE. I REMEMBER EVERYTHING AND I NEVER FORGIVE. AND SOON, VERY SOON, I WILL HAVE ALL OF THE POWER IN THE WORLD. AND THEN WHEN THOSE PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT IT, I WILL STRIKE, AND THEN 'HELL' WILL ONLY BE A A WORD." [ EVIL LAUGH ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT'S ROUGH.
Jimmy: GUYS, LISTEN TO THIS. A NEW POLL FOUND THAT WOMEN IN AMERICA ARE ANGRIER ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS THAN MEN. AND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THEM EVEN ANGRIER JUST TELL THEM THEY SEEM ANGRY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SEEM -- YOU SEEM ANGRY, HONEY. WHAT?
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: THE SAME POLL FOUND THAT WHITE AMERICANS ARE ANGRIER ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS THAN AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS. AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS WOULD BE MORE UPSET, BUT THEY'RE HAVING TOO MUCH FUN WATCHING WHITE PEOPLE GET ANGRY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS YESTERDAY? THE BUFFALO BILLS BEAT THE NEW YORK JETS. BUT DURING THE GAME, BUFFALO BILLS KICKER DAN CARPENTER MISSED AN EXTRA POINT ATTEMPT. AND OF COURSE, HE WAS PRETTY UPSET, BUT HIS TROUBLES DIDN'T END THERE. CHECK OUT WHAT HAPPENED.
CARPENTER UPSET AT HIMSELF, AFTER THE EXTRA POINT TRY.
YOU KNOW, HE WAS PLAYING THE WIND. [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: IT GOT EVEN WORSE WHEN HE TURNED AROUND AND STEPPED ON A RAKE. IT WAS LIKE, OOH. [ THUMP ] [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS PRETTY COOL, YOU GUYS. I HEARD THAT A MAN IN LONDON JUST TOOK UBER'S ONE BILLIONTH RIDE. AND TO CELEBRATE, UBER GAVE HIM A YEARS WORTH OF FREE RIDES. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] THE MAN SAID HE'S EXCITED TO SPEND THE ENTIRE YEAR DRUNK.
Steve: OH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I TOOK AN UBER -- [ DRUNK MUMBLES ] [ LAUGHTER ] PARENTS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS. I JUST READ ABOUT A NEW SURVEY THAT FOUND THAT TEENS IN THE U.S. ARE LESS REBELLIOUS THAN THEY USED TO BE. MAINLY BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO BE A BAD ASS WHEN YOUR NAME IS KALEB. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU TELL HIM KALEB TOLD YOU THAT! [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT KOKO, THE 44-YEAR-OLD GORILLA THAT KNOWS SIGN LANGUAGE WAS RECORDED GIVING A NEW YEAR'S MESSAGE WHERE SHE SAID THAT HUMANS ARE STUPID AND NEED TO PROTECT THE EARTH. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN KOKO'S SISTER WAS LIKE, "SEE THIS IS WHY YOU'RE 44 AND STILL SINGLE ON NEW YEAR'S EVE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN THIS IS -- YOU CAN'T GO AROUND BEING SUCH A DOWNER." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] KOKO.
Steve: KOKO.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND FINALLY, I HEARD THAT CHINA JUST INSTALLED NEW PUBLIC BATHROOMS IN BEIJING THAT ACTUALLY OFFER WI-FI. YEAH. A WI-FI ENABLED BATHROOM, OR AS WE CALL THAT IN AMERICA, STARBUCKS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU LOOK GREAT.
I HAD IT PAINTED ON THIS AFTERNOON.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. IT'S VERY NICE. VERY INTERESTING, YEAH. YOU ALWAYS LOOK LIKE YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE. DO YOU HAVE TO BE, BECAUSE YOU'RE ROCKY?
NO, ACTUALLY, IT WAS JUST --
Jimmy: I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
ROCKY'S FALLING APART A A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
HE'S STARTING TO BECOME, LIKE, ROXANNE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, NO. BUT I MEAN, I FEEL -- LIKE, DO HAVE ANY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS? DO YOU HAVE A THING WHERE LIKE -- YOU WOULD NEVER SAY, "OH, I GOT TO WORK OUT MORE OR GO TO THE GYM MORE." RIGHT?
NO, NO. I'VE DECIDED TO NOT TO GO TO THE GYM ANYMORE AND DECIDED TO -- I REALLY WANT TO EAT EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH THAT'S FANTASTIC. YOU SHOULD DO THAT. BUT THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR YOU. YOU SHOULD BE EATING, BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING NOMINATED FOR ALL THESE AWARDS, GOLDEN GLOBES THIS SUNDAY. CONGRATULATIONS, FOR "CREED." I MEAN, YOU'RE PHENOMENAL. THIS IS GREAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S GOT TO FEEL GOOD. THAT'S GOT TO FEEL GOOD, BUDDY.
NO, IT WAS QUITE A PLEASANT SURPRISE. I HAVE TO GIVE TOTAL CREDIT THOUGH TO THE DIRECTOR, RYAN COOGLER, AND MICHAEL B. JORDAN. THEY'RE EXTRAORDINARY. I WAS JUST HANGING ON FOR THE RIDE.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. I TOLD YOU BACKSTAGE. I GO, "YOU MADE ME CRY." LIKE, OH, MY GOSH. IT'S TOUGH FOR A MAN TO TELL ANOTHER MAN, YOU DID THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I HAD TO DO IT, BECAUSE IT WAS MOVING. IT WAS GREAT. YOU DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO DO THIS AT FIRST.
NO, NO, BECAUSE I WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH THE LAST -- THE HARDEST FILM I EVER HAD TO GET OFF THE GROUND WAS THE LAST "ROCKY", BECAUSE "ROCKY V" DIDN'T WORK, AND I JUST WANTED TO GO OUT WITH KIND OF, LIKE, SOME SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT WITH THE LAST, "ROCKY BALBOA." BUT THEY SAID, "HEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF TOUGH TO DO A A BOXING FILM WHEN YOU'RE FOLLOWING A BOMB 15 YEARS LATER AND YOU'RE A 60-YEAR-OLD FIGHTER." IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT A A 200-YEAR-OLD POLE DANCER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S NOT -- NO, NO.
THE SAME THING.
Jimmy: THAT WAS ONE REVIEW. ONE REVIEW. BIG DEAL. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, BUT I SEE THIS, YOU REBRANDED IT. NOW IT'S A NEW THING. AND YOU GOT MICHAEL B. JORDAN, WHO'S FANTASTIC AS WELL.
YEAH, HE IS.
Jimmy: YOU GUYS WORK WELL TOGETHER. AFTER HEARING ALL THE STORIES, I MEAN, I THINK WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ABOUT THIS IS THEY FEEL FOR THE CHARACTER, ROCKY BALBOA, AND YOU FEEL LIKE ANYONE CAN GET THIS. THIS COULD BE ANYBODY. THIS ONE, IT TUGS AT YOUR HEART STRINGS. AND, JUST LIKE --
IT'S TRUE. IT'S ONE FIGHT. THERE'S ONE THING TO BE COMPETITIVE IN SPORTS. AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THIS KID CAME UP WITH AN IDEA, THE ONE FIGHT THAT EVERY ONE OF US IS GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT IS YOUR OWN MORTALITY. AND WHETHER IT GOES WELL, IT GOES BAD, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD. AND IT'S HOW YOU DEAL WITH IT THAT MAKES IT AN INTERESTING JOURNEY.
Jimmy: YEAH, BECAUSE YOU START THE MOVIE, THE "ROCKY" MOVIES, STARTED OFF WITH JUST A A YOUNG GUY WHO HAD NOTHING.
NOTHING.
Jimmy: NOTHING TO LOSE.
MM-HMM.
Jimmy: AND NOW HERE WE ARE.
HE'S LOST EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: WE FOLLOWED THE CHARACTER ALL THE WAY. IT'S LIKE, IT'S JUST MOVING. I READ UP ABOUT YOU. I TOLD YOU THIS, BECAUSE I'M A A BIG FAN. BUT THE FIRST "ROCKY", AND TELL ME IF I'M MAKING THIS UP, YOU HAD TO SELL YOUR DOG?
YEAH, I DID, POOR BUTKUS. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Jimmy: WAIT, HOLD ON. THERE'S A HAPPY ENDING.
WHEN I MOVED TO NEW YORK, FOR SOME REASON, I'VE ALWAYS LIKED DOGS. I ALWAYS HAD A DOG. I HAD A VERY, VERY SMALL ROOM. IT WAS ABOUT $28 EVERY TWO WEEKS. THEY CHARGE YOU BY THE WEEK -- BY EVERY OTHER WEEK. SO I BOUGHT A DOG THAT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE ROOM.
Jimmy: PERFECT. [ LAUGHTER ] HE CAN FIT IN THERE.
HE WAS LIKE BARKING FURNITURE.
Jimmy: WHY NOT?
A VERY LARGE BULL MASTIFF. ANYWAY, I CAME OUT TO CALIFORNIA AND I WROTE "ROCKY." BEFORE I WROTE "ROCKY", I'M SORRY, I WAS PRETTY BROKE. AND I HAD TO GO TO THE 7-ELEVEN STORE. AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN'T AFFORD TO FEED THE DOG ANYMORE."
Jimmy: CAN'T AFFORD TO FEED IT?
NO, NO, NO. AND I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO EAT ME EVENTUALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] I SAID "ONE OF US HAS TO" --
Jimmy: TOWN AIN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR THE BOTH OF US.
SO, A FELLOW CAME ALONG AND BOUGHT THE DOG FOR $50. SUPPOSEDLY, IT WAS GOING TO A A GOOD HOME. THEN "ROCKY" HAPPENED, AND I FINALLY GOT PAID. I WENT TO THE GUY. I SAID, "CAN I BUY MY DOG BACK?" HE SAID, "SURE, FOR $1,500." [ LAUGHTER ] "AND A PART IN THE MOVIE." I SAID, "NO, NO, I'M NOT QUITE LIKE THAT." BUT THAT WAS -- SO THE DOG CAME BACK IN THE FILM. I JUST FIGURED HE HAD BEEN THROUGH THAT WHOLE JOURNEY, EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T QUITE FIT IN THE MOVIE. LIKE, "WHAT IS THIS 200-POUND DOG DOING IN A PET SHOP?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT HE DID. BUTKUS. "YO, BUTKUS."
"YO, BUTKUS."
Jimmy: THAT'S MY DOG. HE MADE HIS MARK IN THE MOVIE.
HE'S STILL MY SCREEN SAVER.
Jimmy: IS HE REALLY?
YES, HE IS.
Jimmy: HE'S YOUR SCREEN SAVER RIGHT NOW? OH, MY GOD. I LOVE THAT STORY. I LOVE THAT YOU GOT HIM BACK, TOO. AND YOU TOOK CARE OF THE GUY, TOO, RIGHT?
YEAH, AND HE GOT TO BE IN THE MOVIE. EVERYONE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I LOVE IT. I LOVE PEOPLE. YEAH, "50 BUCKS? YEAH, GIVE ME $1,000."
$1,500.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A THING, A A SAYING IN THE MOVIES CALLED THE "DEAD MAN WALKING SCENE."
"DEAD MAN WALKING SCENE." WHEN YOU DO A "ROCKY" FILM FOR SOME REASON, WE DECIDED TO HAVE THIS, KIND OF, INITIATION THAT YOU HAVE TO BE CLOBBERED, USUALLY BY A MAN INFINITELY STRONGER AND LARGER, SUCH AS CARL WEATHERS, WHO IS BRILLIANT. HE PLAYED APOLLO CREED. BUT, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A A WORLD-CLASS ATHLETE.
Jimmy: GETTING PUNCHED, REALLY PUNCHING.
OH, MY GOSH. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE WEATHER FOR THE NEXT WEEK. BOOM. [ LAUGHTER ] I SEE RAIN AND STARS. SO ANYWAY --
Jimmy: WHO HIT YOU THE HARDEST?
DOLPH LUNDGREN PUT ME IN THE HOSPITAL FOR FOUR AND A HALF DAYS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DOLPH LUNDGREN, REALLY?
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, REALLY.
Jimmy: WHAT DID HE DO?
HE HIT ME SO HARD IN THE CHEST, THAT THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I WAS ON A LOW ALTITUDE FLIGHT TO INTENSIVE CAR AT ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL SURROUNDED BY FOUR NUNS. [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT, "HERE I GO."
Jimmy: HERE'S THE END RIGHT HERE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: REALLY? ST. PETER KNOWS TO CALL ME.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH.
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: SO, MICHAEL B. JORDAN GOES --
SO, MICHAEL .B JORDAN GOES, "HEY, MAN, I'M PART OF THE 'ROCKY' FAMILY." I SAID, "NO, YOU'RE KIND OF LIKE DEAD MAN WALKING, BECAUSE UNLESS YOU TAKE THE SHOT, YOU REALLY CAN'T BE PART OF THE FAMILY." HE GOES, "WELL, BRING IT ON." SO I GO TO THE OTHER FELLOW, WHO IS A WORLD CHAMPION, AND I SAID, "JUST GIVE A LITTLE HIP TO IT." NOW, WHEN A REAL PRO HITS YOU, IT ISN'T LIKE, YOU SEE THE BAR ROOM BRAWLS OR THESE WESTERNS, A BIG PUNCH. IT'S BOOM! NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TALKING TO ANGELS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT JUST -- IT'S REALLY UNBELIEVABLE WHEN A PRO HITS YOU. SO MICHAEL GOES, "BRING IT ON. IF YOU CAN DO IT, I'M GOING TO DO IT." SO I SAY, "BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR, MICHAEL."
Jimmy: THIS IS A CLIP. THIS IS REAL. IT'S A CLIP OF THEM FILMING, BEHIND THE SCENES. BUT THIS MADE IT INTO THE MOVIE. HERE'S MICHAEL B. JORDAN GETTING THE "DEAD MAN WALKING" SCENE, GETTING CLOBBERED. WATCH THIS. IT'S REAL.
SET. BACKGROUND, SOUND SPEED, AND ACTION. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE BAND LOVES IT.
Jimmy: I MEAN, WOW! WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW!
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
Jimmy: YEAH. AND YOU DID HOW MANY "ROCKY" MOVIES? [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH. I SWEAR, IT REALLY DOESN'T. OH, NO.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP OF THE FILM, ITSELF, THAT ACTUALLY MADE IT TO THE FINAL. BUT THIS IS MORE OF A DRAMATIC SCENE BETWEEN YOU AND CREED, AND JUST TELLING ABOUT THE FUTURE AND JUST LIFE ITSELF. AND IT'S JUST FANTASTIC. SYLVESTER STALLONE AS ROCKY IN THE FILM "CREED." CHECK THIS OUT.
EVERYTHING I GOT IS MOVED ON, AND I'M HERE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S OKAY. BECAUSE I SAID TO MYSELF, "IF I BREAK OR I'M HURT, WHATEVER, I AIN'T GONNA FIX IT. WHY BOTHER?"
AND I'M JUST A BUM WHO'S LIVING IN YOUR CRIB. JUST NOTHING.
YOU'RE A GOOD KID, A GOOD FIGHTER, BUT YOU GOT YOUR WHOLE FUTURE AHEAD OF YOU. MINE? BACK THERE, LIKE ALL THEM GUYS ON THE WALL, IN THE BACK, IN THE PAST. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
