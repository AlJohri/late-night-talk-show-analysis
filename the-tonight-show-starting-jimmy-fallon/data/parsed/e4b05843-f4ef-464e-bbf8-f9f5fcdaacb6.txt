Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, I FEEL THE LOVE. IT'S A HOT CROWD. IT'S A HOT CROWD TONIGHT. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE "THE TONIGHT SHOW" EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. "THE TONIGHT SHOW." IT'S A GREAT SHOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. I LOVE YOU, TOO. LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. DID YOU SEE THIS? DURING THIS DURING A Q&A SESSION AT THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY, A LITTLE GIRL ACTUALLY ASKED FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA HOW OLD SHE IS. [ LAUGHTER ] MICHELLE WAS LIKE, "OLD ENOUGH TO PUT YOU ON THE NO-FLY LIST, SWEETHEART." [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T ASK. DON'T ASK. MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT OBAMA VISITED THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES YESTERDAY TO CELEBRATE EARTH DAY AND DISCUSS CLIMATE CHANGE. CHECK OUT THE PICTURE FROM THE EVENT. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOKS LESS LIKE THE PRESIDENT, MORE LIKE THE STAR OF "CSI: EVERGLADES." [ LAUGHTER ] LOOKS LIKE HIS LIFE GOT VETOED. ♪♪ THAT'S RIGHT, OBAMA WAS IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES YESTERDAY TO TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND IT MIGHT JUST BE ME, BUT IT FELT LIKE HE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. WATCH THIS.
WE WANT TO RESTORE THE NATURAL WATER FLOW OF THE EVERGLADES. AS SEA LEVELS RISE, SALTY WATER FROM OCEAN FLOWS INWARD. THIS IS LIKE WE'RE HITTING THE BRAKES ON A CAR, BUT THE CAR'S NOT GOING TO COME TO A COMPLETE HALT RIGHT AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GOT A COMING STORM, YOU DON'T STICK YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND. YOU PREPARE FOR THE STORM. [ LAUGHTER ] TEDDY ROOSEVELT, HE'S A A REPUBLICAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT HAPPENED?
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: EVEN BEAUTY PAGEANT CONTESTANTS WERE LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT?" PREPARE FOR THE STORM, YOU PUT YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND.
Steve: DID YOU GET IT?
Jimmy: THE CAR'S FAST AND THEN THE CAR COMES TO A HALT. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS FOR THE PRESIDENT. A NEW POLL SHOWS THAT OBAMA'S APPROVAL RATING IS CURRENTLY AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE 2013. IT'S NOT THAT HE'S DOING BETTER, IT'S JUST THAT PEOPLE HAVE SEEN ALL THE CRAZIES LINING UP TO REPLACE HIM. THEY'RE LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT, HE'S NOT THAT BAD. HE'S NOT THAT BAD." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, IF THESE ARE OUR OPTIONS. A THIRD TERM. SPEAKING OF THE ELECTION, THE NEW YORK POST CLAIMS THAT MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO HAS BEEN POSITIONING HIMSELF TO CHALLENGE HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. YEAH. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE OR NOT, BUT I THOUGHT WE COULD AT LEAST TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THE TWO STAND ON KEY ISSUES. HILLARY ONCE DEVELOPED A A PROGRAM TO DELIVER RURAL HEALTHCARE. DE BLASIO ONCE DROPPED A A GROUNDHOG ON ITS HEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] HILLARY THINKS WE SHOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS. DE BLASIO, IT WAS FEBRUARY 2nd, 2014. [ LAUGHTER ] THE GROUNDHOG JUST SLIPPED OUT OF DE BLASIO'S HANDS DURING A A GROUNDHOG DAY EVENT IN STATEN ISLAND. HILLARY HAS SERVED AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. DE BLASIO, THE GROUNDHOG'S NAME WAS STATEN ISLAND CHUCK. [ LAUGHTER ] DE BLASIO AND THE ZOO TRIED TO COVER UP THE INCIDENT, BUT THE TRUTH GOT OUT. NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO 100% DROPPED A GROUNDHOG ON ITS HEAD DURING A PHOTO OP. AND FINALLY, HILLARY IS PRO-CHOICE. DE BLASIO, REST IN PEACE, STATEN ISLAND CHUCK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW YOU KNOW.
Steve: NOW YOU KNOW. NOW YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: GET THIS. IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT GOOGLE SPENT OVER $5 MILLION ON LOBBYING JUST DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR. WHICH IS CRAZY, BECAUSE YOU'D THINK GOOGLE WOULDN'T REALLY NEED TO LOBBY POLITICIANS. ALL THEY'D HAVE TO SAY IS "WE HAVE YOUR SEARCH HISTORY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DO WHAT WE TELL YOU." THIS WAS KIND OF WEIRD. YESTERDAY, I SAW THAT YESTERDAY, CONGRESS RECEIVED 6,000 FREE TACO BELL TACOS FROM LOBBYISTS AS A THANKS FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. 6,000 TACOS. IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS AFFECTING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN THE AFTERNOON. TAKE A LOOK.
I THINK IT DESERVES OUR CAREFUL OVERSIGHT AND SCRUTINY. [ FART SOUNDS ] [ LAUGHTER ] AS WE HAVE SEEN IN RECENT WEEKS THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICAN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS HAVE LITTLE TO NO EXPERIENCE WITH THE -- [ FART SOUNDS ]

I READ THAT MANY MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYERS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT USING STEROIDS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. APPARENTLY, NOT ENOUGH STEROIDS. [ LAUGHTER ] MINOR LEAGUE.
