Jimmy: THAT'S THE BEST, THE GIANT GUMMY WORM.
I ACTUALLY WAS GIVEN THIS BY THE ROCK. [ LAUGHTER ] HE GAVE ME THIS.
Jimmy: IS THAT -- NO, NO, NO, DON'T -- [ LAUGHTER ] HERE, SPIT THAT OUT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT THAT. ♪♪ YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP IT GOING? ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU WENT FOR IT, MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] OH! ALL RIGHT, HEY, ALL RIGHT. HEY, COME ON, NOW.
I'M NOT SOMETHING DOWN.
Jimmy: I GOT ONE, TOO, FROM THE ROCK! HERE WE GO.
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF I CHOKED AND DIED RIGHT NOW? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ON A GUMMY WORM.
THE ROCK --
Jimmy: THE ROCK GAVE YOU A A GIANT GUMMY WORM. LOOK AT THIS.
FIRST OF ALL, THAT GUY'S BEEN EATING CANDY SINCE WHENEVER I'VE KNOWN HIM. HE WAS A ROOMMATE OF MINE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING TOGETHER. THE REASON HE'S CALLED "THE ROCK" BECAUSE ALL HE ATE WAS ROCK CANDY.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, EXACTLY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY HE'S CALLED THE ROCK. HE'S A LIAR! I CHALLENGE HIM TO COME OUT HERE. AND I'LL KICK HIS ASS.
Jimmy: NO! [ YELLING ] HEY! CALM DOWN! NO! COME ON! IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN! FATHER'S DAY'S COMING UP. WHAT ELSE CAN WE GIVE DAD BESIDES A GIANT GUMMY WORM?
THESE ARE -- [ MUMBLING ] [ LAUGHTER ]
DO PEOPLE REALLY EAT THAT?
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.
I DO. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, BUT JIMMY, THINGS ARE BEAUTIFUL, BUT LET'S GET IT OUT OF THE WAY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT DOES THESE GIFTS SAY, "DAD, I LOVE YOU?" NO, THEY DON'T. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, A BOOK COULD BE A GOOD GIFT FOR DAD, BUT IT HAS TO BE THE RIGHT BOOK.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I'VE READ OVER A A THOUSAND BOOKS, AND I THINK I'VE FOUND SOME OF THE RIGHT BOOKS FOR DAD.
Jimmy: VERY GOOD.
THIS ONE BOOK, WHICH BY THE WAY, IT'S A GREAT BOOK.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND BY COINCIDENCE, IT'S ALSO WRITTEN BY A GUY NAMED JIMMY FALLON. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Jimmy: THAT IS ME, ACTUALLY. THAT IS MY BOOK. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT IS MY BOOK.

Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
WAIT A MINUTE. I HAVEN'T FINISHED IT YET. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, ALL RIGHT.
DOES THAT QUALIFY AS WRITING, JIMMY?
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS A GOOD BOOK, BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT? JIMMY, HONESTLY, A GOOD BOOK FOR DAD IS IMPORTANT, AND REALLY, THE BEST BOOKS, WHICH ARE WRITTEN BY ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, THIS IS GOOD. "DAD IS FAT." I READ THAT ONE.
AND "FOOD, A LOVE STORY."
Jimmy: "FOOD, A LOVE STORY."
AMAZING.
Jimmy: THESE ARE GREAT.
I MEAN --
Jimmy: AGAIN, THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU.
I MEAN, THIS IS IF YOU LIKE WORDS. IF YOU DON'T LIKE WORDS --
Jimmy: IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THERE'S THIS ONE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DON'T GIVE AWAY THE ENDING.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT HERE TO PROMOTE MY STUFF.
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT HERE TO DO THAT.
I'M NOT HERE TO DO THAT. FATHER'S DAY IS ABOUT FINDING A A GIFT FOR DAD, AND REALLY, YOU'RE A DAD. I'M A DAD. A LOT OF US ARE DADS UNLESS THEY'RE NOT DADS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH OUR KIDS. SO BUYING MAYBE TICKETS TO AN EVENT WITH DAD WOULD BE GREAT.

Jimmy: HOW MANY DO WE HAVE OF THESE?
I'VE GOT A LOT OF THEM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I KNOW. THAT LAST ONE WASN'T A GUMMY WORM. THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME. IT'S ABOUT SPENDING TIME WITH DAD. THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.
Jimmy: QUALITY TIME.
AND HE WANTS QUALITY TIME.
Jimmy: AND HOW WOULD HE SPEND QUALITY TIME?
