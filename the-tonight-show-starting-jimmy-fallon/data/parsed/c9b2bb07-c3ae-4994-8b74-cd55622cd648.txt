HE'S PROBABLY GOT HIS FACE IN THAT CAMERA, AND HE'S GONE WAY OFF, LIKE, FOLLOWING THESE THINGS." AND WE'RE ALMOST AT THE END OF THE DIVE. AND I'M JUST THINKING I SHOULD JUST GO CHECK ON HIM. I START SWIMMING OUT, LIKE, DEEP INTO THE OCEAN. AND I'M COMING ALONG, AND WAY OFF IN THE MURK, LIKE, A SHARK, YOU KNOW. I SEE SOMETHING, AND THEN I SEE IT'S LEO, AND HE'S COMING TOWARD ME.

YEAH.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MEANS, BUT I'M LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S NOT GOOD."
THERE'S TWO THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW. ONE IS, WE'RE ONLY ABOUT 50 FEET DEEP, AND ALL HE HAD TO DO IS GO UP. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, HE COULD HAVE GONE UP AT ANY TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT I WOULD HAVE FREAKED OUT, TOO. I GET NERVOUS IN A MR. TURTLE POOL. [ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE I KNOW THIS, AND I KNOW HE'S NOT THINKING OF IT. I HAD THE HORRIBLE INSTINCT TO LET HIM GET CLOSE TO ME, AND THEN PULL BACK.
Jimmy: WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? EDWARD, DON'T DO THAT.
NO, BUT I -- SO I GIVE IT TO HIM. AND HE'S LIKE --
Jimmy: YOU SAVED -- YOU GAVE HIM OXYGEN?
WE DID THE BUDDY BREATHE THING, YOU KNOW, AND WE GO UP. AND HE'S LIKE FALLING ALL OVER ME LIKE, "OH, BUDDY, BUDDY, YOU SAVED MY LIFE. YOU SAVED ME," YOU KNOW. AND I'M LIKE, "LET'S GET OUT OF THE WATER. LIKE, LET'S NOT DO THIS HERE." [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: PROBABLY NEVER, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] GOSH.
BUT, NO. IT'S THE FIRST TIME.
Jimmy: AND THE MOVIE'S GREAT. THE SCRIPT, THE IDEA IS --
IT'S VERY -- IT'S ACTUALLY -- IT STRUCK ME A LOT LIKE NOT TO USE AN OBVIOUS ONE, BUT "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE" OR --
Jimmy: YEAH.
OR FILMS THAT I LOVE LIKE "TERMS OF ENDEARMENT" THAT DO TOUCH ON -- IT TOUCHED ON VERY SERIOUS THEMES ABOUT HOW LIFE IS CHALLENGING. BUT IT'S A VERY -- IT'S ALSO VERY FUNNY AND VERY ACCESSIBLE. AND I THINK, ULTIMATELY, IT'S VERY WISE. I KIND OF THINK AT THE END OF THE YEAR -- IT'S NOT SO MUCH A A CHRISTMAS THING. BUT AT THE END OF THE YEAR, I THINK, WE ALL, ULTIMATELY, LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT YEAR AND SAY, LIKE, "HOW AM I GOING TO PUT THINGS IN BETTER BALANCE? HOW CAN I BE A BETTER VERSION OF MYSELF?" AND I THINK THIS MOVIE SPEAKS A A LOT TO THOSE IMPULSES TO KIND OF BALANCE YOUR LIFE BETTER.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW A A CLIP. HERE'S EDWARD NORTON AND WILL SMITH IN "COLLATERAL BEAUTY." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WE'RE GONNA LOSE THE DOWNWORTH ACCOUNT. BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP, AND THEY'RE NOT FEELING THE LOVE YOU MIGHT IMAGINE. SO THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

GARETH EDWARDS REALLY KINDLY ASKED ME TO AUDITION, SENT ME SOME SCRIPT, SOME, LIKE, PAGES FOR A SCENE TO DO. SO, I MEAN, THAT'S ALL FINE, BUT HE MADE THE MISTAKE OF GIVING ME HIS E-MAIL ADDRESS. SO I SENT HIM ONE VERSION OF THE SCENE OF THE AUDITION, AND A FEW HOURS LATER, I WAS LIKE, "I'LL DO ANOTHER WAY." AND THEN, A FEW HOURS LATER, I DID IT AGAIN.
