Jimmy: WE SHOULD GET IN THE COQUITO BUSINESS. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S A VERY NICHE BUSINESS. BUT IT WILL WORK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT WON'T BE NICHE WHEN WE GET IN THERE AND EVERYONE'S DRINKING COQUITO YEAR ROUND. THEY HAVE DRINKABLE YOGURT. WHO THOUGHT THAT WOULD TAKE OFF?
WELL, WE DON'T WANT THAT ONE. WE DON'T WANT ANY DRINKABLE YOGURT.
Jimmy: BUT IF YOU DO LIKE POQUITO COQUITO. [ LAUGHTER ]
NOW WE TALKING. [ CHEERS ] NOW WE TALKING.
Jimmy: NOW THIS IS MAKING SENSE?
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: YEAH, WE GOT TO DO IT. SO NOW YOU HAVE A SOCCER TEAM?
YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. AND THEY COME -- THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY IN NEW YORK SOON. SO THEY'LL BE HERE, RIGHT?
YEAH, I'M BRINGING THEM HERE FOR THE PUERTO RICAN DAY PARADE WEEKEND. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: THAT LEAVES THE NEW YORK TEAM AT A DISADVANTAGE.
WE'RE GONNA BE PLAYING AGAINST THE PUERTO RICO NATIONAL TEAM SO WE MADE IT ONE BIG FAMILY EVENT.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? THIS IS -- I KNEW YOU PLAYED THE NEW YORK COSMOS ON JULY 30th. BUT THIS A NEW THING FOR YOU. YOU ALWAYS WANT TO GET INTO THIS?
I WAS ALWAYS A FAN OF SOCCER.
Jimmy: YEAH.
ALWAYS A FAN, BIG FAN. ONCE I STARTED GOING BACK DOWN TO THE ISLAND, I SAW THAT THE ISLAND WAS MISSING SOMETHING. WE DON'T HAVE NOTHING THAT WE CAN CALL OUR OWN DOWN THERE ON THE ISLAND. WE GOT TO CHEER FOR DOMINICAN. WE GOT TO CHEER FOR CUBA. NOW, WE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHEER FOR SOMETHING THAT WE CALL OUR OWN. AND THAT'S PUERTO RICO FOOTBALL CLUB. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW, I HAVE YOUR SNEAKERS. I HAVE MELOS. BUT I KNOW YOU'RE INTO FASHION STUFF TOO. BUT YOU GOT INVOLVED WITH KIDS' CLOTHING.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I THINK IS SO RAD. I SHOWED A LITTLE BIT OF IT. BUT THIS IS TMNT BY MELO AT MACY'S. AND LOOK AT THIS, COME ON. IT'S MY JAM. AND IT'S SMOOTH AND IT'S COOL. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU GOT A LITTLE -- GOT LITTLE MELO SOCKS. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] THIS WOULDN'T EVEN FIT ON LIKE ONE PINKY TOE.
IT'S KIDS, IT'S KIDS.
Jimmy: I KNOW IT'S KIDS. STILL. THIS IS KIDS?
YES. OLDER KIDS.
Jimmy: THEY'RE TALL KIDS.
THEY ESPECIALLY MADE FOR YOU, THOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A GIANT KID. TALL. LIKE MAYBE MELO AS A KID. MAYBE.
I CAN'T FIT IN THOSE.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T FIT IN THOSE, NO.
YOU CAN.
Jimmy: YEAH, I CAN DO THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN -- THANK YOU. BUT YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE NOW, "TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES." DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM GROWING UP?
I WAS ALWAYS A BIG FAN. IF YOU WASN'T A FAN OF THE TURTLES GROWING UP, THEN SOMETHING IS WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ] SOMETHING'S VERY WRONG.
Jimmy: EATIN' PIZZA, SHREDDER, ALL THAT STUFF. YOU GOT TO GET INTO IT.
YOU HAVE TO GET INTO IT.
Jimmy: IS YOUR SON INTO IT?
MY SON IS INTO IT.
Jimmy: TELL HIM I SAID HI.
I WILL. HE LOVES YOU, MAN.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT KID. WE BONDED.
I KNOW. AT THE GAME?
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU BUMMED OUT ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?
NO, NO, I'M ACTUALLY EXCITED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU MADE A FACE LIKE "YEAH, I KNOW, I'M BUMMED OUT HE LIKED YOU."
I GET TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
YEAH, I HEAR ABOUT IT EVERY DAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE BONDED, MAN. WE HAVE THE SAME BRAIN. HOW OLD IS HE?
NINE.
Jimmy: YEAH, NINE. YEAH, WE -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE WERE HAVING FUN. I SHOWED HIM SNAPCHAT FILTERS. HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE FILTERS.
THAT'S BAD PARENTING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, HE WAS WITH LALA. WE WERE HANGING OUT --
OH, YOU BLAME IT ON HER?
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
BAD PARENTING.
Jimmy: BAD PARENTING, YEAH. DEFINITELY, YEAH. I LOVE THAT KID SO MUCH. HE WAS SO COOL. VERY POLITE BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WHAT A GREAT KID. YOU REALLY -- WHAT A NICE KID. I REALLY HAD THE BEST TIME WITH HIM. THEN I WENT TO A DIFFERENT GAME. FIRST OF ALL, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ROOT FOR YOU BECAUSE NORMALLY MY SEATS AREN'T THAT GOOD BUT THEY PUT ME COURT SIDE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO WHEN YOU WERE COMING IN, I DIDN'T WANT TO SEEM LIKE, A A GOOFY KID. LIKE, "HI, MELO." [ LAUGHTER ] SO I WAS JUST LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I PUT MY GAME FACE ON. I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SCREW UP OR DO ANYTHING. SO I WENT TO A DIFFERENT GAME. AND I WAS SITTING IN MY NORMAL SEATS. I HEARD "JIMMY FALLON." CUTEST LITTLE KID VOICE. I WAS LIKE, "WHAT'S UP?"
IT WAS HIM?
Jimmy: IT WAS KIYAN, YEAH.
HE DON'T FORGET.
Jimmy: HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?
HE DON'T FORGET.
Jimmy: HE DOESN'T FORGET.
NO, NOT AT ALL.
Jimmy: AH, YOU GOT TO GIVE HIM MY BEST.
I WILL.
Jimmy: SO HE MUST BE EXCITED THAT YOU'RE IN THIS "TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLE" MOVIE.
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. HE THINKS I'M ONE OF THE CHARACTERS OR SOMETHING. I KEEP TRYING TO TELL HIM IT'S JUST A QUICK CAMEO IN THE MOVIE. DON'T EXPECT ME TO BE FLYING THROUGH THE AIR, GOING UNDERGROUND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT A TURTLE IN THIS?
I'M NOT A TURTLE.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH. ONCE AND FOR ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW MANY TIMES WE GOT TO PUT THIS TO REST NOW? I'M NOT A TURTLE. YEAH, I DO THIS ALL THE TIME. IT'S THE COOLEST THING.
