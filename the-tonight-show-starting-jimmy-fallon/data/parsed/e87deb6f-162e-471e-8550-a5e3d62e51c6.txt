YEAH. KAWASAKI RACING GREEN.
Jimmy: KAWASAKI RACING GREEN?
THAT WAS THE CONCEPT, RIGHT? YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU WANT TO VERTICAL TO GO FAST. YOU'RE GOING DOWN SEVEN MILES. SO, I WANTED TO HAVE TIME TO EXPLORE WHEN I GET DOWN THERE. I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MORE TIME CRAMPED UP THAT SPHERE THAN I HAD TO.
Jimmy: SO IN A SUBMARINE, YOU'D BE LIKE THIS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT YOUR GUY GOES LIKE THAT.
YEAH. ABOUT THAT FAST, TOO. YEAH.
Jimmy: HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM BOTTOM?
IT WAS ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS TO GET DOWN. ABOUT THREE HOURS ON THE BOTTOM.
Jimmy: JAMES, JAMES, JAMES. [ LAUGHTER ] AT WHAT PART DID YOU FREAK OUT AND GO "THAT'S IT, MY LIFE'S OVER. AND I CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD. AND I'M DOWN HERE WITH ALIENS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE'RE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER. IT'S A PERFECT ENDING TO MY LIFE"?
YEAH, YEAH. EXACTLY. IT ALL MADE SENSE AT THE TIME.
Jimmy: WHEN DID YOU FREAK OUT, FREAK OUT? 'CAUSE YOU TALKED TO YOUR -- I KNOW YOU SAID GOODBYE TO YOUR WIFE.
SUZY WAS WITH ME ON THE SHIP.
Jimmy: YEAH.
ON THE EXPEDITION. SHE KISSED ME GOODBYE WHEN I GOT INSIDE THE SUB. AND THEN SHE, LIKE, GRABBED THE MIC AND CALLED ME WHEN I WAS 7 MILES DOWN TO GIVE ME A A GREETING WHICH, WAS, YOU KNOW, SO COOL. JUST TO HEAR HER VOICE. 'CAUSE I'D HEARD, LIKE, THE COMS GUYS, WHO WAS THIS EX-NAVY GUY. SO IT WAS LIKE, "YEAH, ROGER THAT." I'M ON THE BOTTOM. YOU KNOW, THE DEPTH IS 35,000 WHATEVER, HOWEVER MANY FEET.
Jimmy: WELL THAT WAS THE THING I SAW --
AND HE'S LIKE, "YEP, ROGER THAT." [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] YEAH, ROGER THAT, CHECK.
Jimmy: YOU WANT SOMEONE TO SAY "I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! OH MY GOD!"
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jimmy: YOU GOTTA GET ME ON THAT. THAT'S WHAT I'M GOOD AT. CALL ME NEXT TIME.
YOU COME NEXT TIME.
Jimmy: I WILL SCREAM INTO THAT THING. LIKE "OH MY GOD, BUDDY, YOU DID IT!" [ LAUGHTER ]
WE'LL PUT YOU IN THE SUB IF YOU WANT TO DO SOME SCREAMING.
Jimmy: YEAH, I WILL SCREAM. BUT YOU KNOW, I WAS SHOCKED BECAUSE YOU GOT TO THE BOTTOM. THEY TRIED TO GO TO THE REALLY DEEP. HOW FAR DID THEY GO? 1960 WAS THE LAST TIME.
1960, THEY WENT TO EXACTLY THE SAME DEPTH IN A DIFFERENT PLACE ABOUT 30 MILES AWAY. AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER WHERE I DOVE, BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME.
Jimmy: EXACTLY THE SAME. AND AS SOON AS THEY LANDED, THERE'S SO MUCH SEDIMENT AROUND THEM --
THEY COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
Jimmy: COULDN'T SEE. THEY SAW CLOUDS OUT OF THEIR WINDOW. AND JUST HAD TO GO RIGHT BACK UP.
I FIGURED IF I'M GOING DOWN THERE AS A FILMMAKER, I GOTTA REP. I'D BETTER COME BACK WITH SOME PICTURES. I CAN'T LAND IN A BIG CLOUD AND COME BACK WITH NOTHING.
Jimmy: BUT YOU ALSO TOOK SOIL SAMPLES OR WHATEVER WAS DOWN THERE, SETIMENT OR WHATEVER. YOU HAD THIS TRAP WITH A A CHICKEN IN IT. I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.
YEP, YEP.
Jimmy: AND WHAT ATTACKED IT? IT WAS LIKE A SHRIMP TYPE OF THING?
WELL, IT WAS AN EARLIER DIVE AT 5 MILES DEPTH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT THESE AMPHIPODS, BIG AMPHIPODS THIS BIG JUST CAME IN AND JUST STRIPPED THAT CHICKEN LIKE PIRANHA. JUST LIKE --
Jimmy: NOW, WHEN YOU SEE THIS THING, IT'S JUST THE CARCASS LEFT. JUST PERFECT BONE WITH NOTHING -- NO FAT OR ANYTHING.
CRAZY.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE THOSE? AMPHIPODS?
AMPHIPODS.
Jimmy: AMPHIPODS.
SO THE WHOLE BURIAL AT SEA THING --
Jimmy: LIKE SEA MONKEYS. LIKE GIANT SEA MONKEYS. [ LAUGHTER ]
GIANT SEA MONKEYS, THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE. YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE. SO YOU GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM. I WOULD HAVE BEEN WEEPING, FIRST OF ALL. BUT YOU WERE COOL. YOU KEPT YOUR COOL. YOU'RE JAMES CAMERON. YOU'RE LIKE "ALL RIGHT, I'VE DONE SOME COOL STUFF." [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD HAVE BEEN CRYING MY EYES OUT. BUT I WANTED TO HEAR, LIKE, "THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN. ONE GIANT DIVE FOR MAN --" OR SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE MASTER OF THE GREAT LINES. LIKE, "I'LL BE BACK." YOU'RE "I'LL BE BACK." THAT'S YOU. "I'LL BE BACK." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING -- YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING --
SET UP FOR MY FAILURE.
Jimmy: YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE THING AND YOU GO "THAT'S OKAY, GUYS. EVERYTHING'S FINE. I'M SAFE AND EVERYTHING'S GOOD AT THE BOTTOM." LIKE, "TELL MY WIFE I LOVE HER AND I'M FINE."
YOU'LL SEE IN THE MOVIE, WHAT I ACTUALLY SAID -- I SAID I'M FINE. EVERYTHING'S OKAY. HERE'S THE DEPTH. AND THEN THERE'S THIS LONG PAUSE AND I SAY TO MYSELF, "WHATEVER I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SAY RIGHT NOW, THAT'S NOT IT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S IT. BUT THEN YOU DID SAY A LINE, THAT I THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR LINE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME IF IT WAS OR IF IT WASN'T. BUT YOU SAID TO YOUR WIFE, "HONEY, LOVE TO YOU FROM THE HEART OF THE OCEAN."
FROM THE HEART OF THE OCEAN, YEP. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] AND THAT JUST POPPED INTO MY HEAD.
Jimmy: THAT WAS A GOOD ONE. IT WASN'T PLANNED. IT WAS GREAT.
WASN'T PLANNED.
Jimmy: AGAIN, I WAS CRYING AT HOME, WATCHING THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU TOOK -- I JUST LOVE THAT YOU DID THIS. I JUST LOVE THAT YOU DID THIS. BECAUSE WHO ELSE COULD DO THIS? YOU KIND OF BUILT THE THING IN AUSTRALIA. AND NO ONE REALLY KNEW -- IN, LIKE, A WAREHOUSE.
PART OF IT WAS BUILT HERE AND PART OF IT WAS BUILT IN AUSTRALIA. AND WE BOLTED IT TOGETHER DOWN THERE.
Jimmy: AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THIS WAREHOUSE? IT WAS LIKE THE BACK OF A A BURNED DOWN BEST BUY.
YEAH, RIGHT. EXACTLY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND YOU DO THIS. AND THEN YOU GO DOWN AND YOU -- YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A ROLEX WATCH ATTACHED TO ONE OF THE HYDROLIC ARMS --
ON THE ROBOTIC ARM, YEAH.
Jimmy: ALL THE WAY DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE TO SHOW THAT IT DIDN'T EXPLODE BECAUSE THEY DID THAT IN 1960.
THEY DID IT ON THE TRIESTE DIRVE IN 1960, WHICH IS THE FIRST TIME SOMEBODY HAD GONE THAT DEEP.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW, BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN --
YOU HAVE BOTH WATCHES, RIGHT?
Jimmy: HERE IS THE -- GOSH, IT'S HEAVY.
YEAH, THAT'S THE NEW ONE.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU TOOK DOWN THERE.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND IT WAS STILL TICKING.
LOOK HOW BIG THE BAND IS. IT'S DESIGNED TO FIT OVER THE ROBOTIC ARM OF THE SUB.
Jimmy: YEAH, ROBOTS HAVE BIG WRISTS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HERE'S THE ONE FROM 1960. LOOK AT THIS GUY. CAN YOU SEE THIS? [ AUDIENCE GASPS ] THAT'S PRETTY COOL. THAT'S A LOT OF CRYSTAL THERE JUST TO MAKE IT NOT EXPLODE. BUT LOOK AT THAT.
YEP.
Jimmy: PART TECHNOLOGY --
IT'S LIKE RETRO CHIC.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND ALSO LOOK HOW WEAK THE ROBOT'S WRISTS WERE BACK THEN. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE BIGGER THING. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. I WAS WATCHING IT AND I GO, "WHAT A GOOD GUY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS." 'CAUSE YOU MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS, BUT YOU ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND SAID, "I'M GOING DO IT. I'M GOING TO MAKE IT WITH MY OWN MONEY. DO IT, DO MY OWN THING." AND YOU TOOK SOIL SAMPLES, AND YOU HAVE NEW SPECIES. AND YOU DISCOVERED NEW SPECIES.
68 NEW SPECIES. YEP.
Jimmy: AT ONE POINT, YOU SAID, "I THINK I'VE GONE LOWER THAN WHERE ANYTHING CAN LIVE."
YEAH. BUT IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE TRUE. LIFE WAS THERE. LIFE ADAPTS.
Jimmy: AND THE OTHER THING I REALLY LOVE THAT YOU DID -- THERE'S TWO THINGS I LOVE. ONE IS YOU TOOK THE ROBOT CAMERA OUT OF THE THING. YOU GO, "LOOK, IF I'M DOWN HERE AND I'M A DIRECTOR, I HAVE TO SEE IT WITH MY OWN EYES."
MY OWN EYES.
Jimmy: AND YOU PUT YOUR EYE UP TO THE WINDOW. AND JUST PEAKED AROUND. IT WAS SO COOL TO SEE THAT. AND I JUST FELT LIKE THAT'S A A REAL DIRECTOR.
BUT AT THAT MOMENT, I BECAME THAT LITTLE KID AGAIN. I USED TO -- IT SHOWS IN THE FILM. I USED TO CUT A HOLE IN A A CARDBOARD BOX, AND SIT INSIDE AND IMAGINE I WAS IN A SUB. GET MY DAD'S FLASHLIGHT AND SHINE IT OUT THE WINDOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, IN YOUR BACKYARD.
I WAS THAT KID AGAIN.
Jimmy: GOSH, IT WAS JUST FASCINATING. I LOVED IT SO MUCH. AND THE OTHER COOL THING YOU DID, YOU DONATED THE SUB AND ALL OF YOUR FINDINGS --
YEAH. TO WOODS HOLE.
Jimmy: WOODS HOLE OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
