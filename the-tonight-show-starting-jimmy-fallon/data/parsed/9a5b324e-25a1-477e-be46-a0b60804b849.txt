COULD YOU IMAGINE?
Jimmy: IT MUST HAVE BEEN, "JUST TELL ME IS THAT LUKE SKYWALKER'S HAND IN THE TRAILER THAT I SAW?" [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, NO ONE IN MY HOUSE CARES.

Jimmy: THEY'RE NOT?
NO, THEY'RE JUST EATING.
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE THE PERFECT DIRECTOR FOR "STAR WARS."
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SAY THIS BECAUSE YOUR EXCITEMENT, WHEN YOU GET BEHIND SOMETHING, YOU'RE SO EXCITED. I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT LIKE ME WHERE YOU'RE LIKE YOU WANT TO DO THE BEST JOB, OBVIOUSLY, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT DOING IT RIGHT, AND ALL THE WORK THAT GOES INTO IT. WE TALKED ABOUT IT WHEN YOU CAME ON THE SHOW FOR "LOST." THAT'S A MYSTERY BOX.
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: DO YOU REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT THIS?
I DO. I MEAN, IT WAS THIS THING, I DID THIS TED TALK YEARS AGO THAT WAS ABOUT THIS BOX THAT MY GRANDFATHER BOUGHT ME FROM A A MAGIC STORE, IT HAS A A QUESTION MARK ON IT. AND IT WAS SORT OF, YOU KNOW, AND THE IDEA WAS THAT IT HAS LIKE $50 WORTH OF MAGIC IN IT FOR $15. AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO OPEN IT, RIGHT? BUT I GOT HOME AND I JUST THOUGHT, IT'S KIND OF A BETTER THING CLOSED. LIKE WHAT'S INSIDE? AND IF YOU NEVER KNOW, IT'S MORE POWERFUL IN A WEIRD WAY. I TALKED ABOUT THAT. IT SEEMED TO BECOME A THING WHERE NOW PEOPLE SORT OF SAY, WELL, YOU'RE JUST ASKING QUESTIONS. YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING ANYTHING. AND SO IT SORT OF HAUNTS ME IN A HORRIBLE WAY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU'RE BRINGING IT UP CRUSHES ME SOMEHOW. GOOD JOB.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. THANK YOU. I'M REAL HAPPY I BROUGHT IT UP.
NO, NO. BUT IT'S THIS THING THAT I REALIZED THAT STORIES ARE KINDA THINGS THAT IF THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB, THEY'RE JUST DRAWING YOU IN, ASKING, YOU KNOW, ASKING MORE AND MORE QUESTIONS. BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING ULTIMATELY INSIDE THE BOX OF VALUE, OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST ASKING A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS. THEY GO NOWHERE.
Jimmy: OH, SO THE THEORY HAS KIND OF EVOLVED EVEN MORE.
IT HAS. AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE "STAR WARS," IT'S THE BEGINNING OF A A TRILOGY, BUT IT NEEDS TO HAVE ITS OWN BEGINNING, MIDDLE, AND AN END. YOU KNOW, IT HAS TO HAVE A A SATISFYING --
Jimmy: WAS "STAR WARS" A BIG THING WHEN YOU WERE A KID?
OH, MY GOD, "STAR WARS." I WAS 11 YEARS OLD. IT WAS JUST, IT BLEW MY MIND.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE.
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: I HAD SHEETS AND MATCHING CURTAINS IN MY BEDROOM FOR A LITTLE BIT TOO LONG. [ LAUGHTER ]
REALLY?
Jimmy: "YOU WANNA COME UP TO MY BEDROOM?" [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. I HAD IT FOR A LITTLE BIT TOO LONG.
YOU KNOW, I LOVED IT. I REMEMBER SEEING THE WORDS IN THE SERIES, THIS GEEKY, WHICH I LOVE, MAGAZINE CALLED "STARLOG." AND I REMEMBER AS A KID, I WAS AT A NEWSSTAND AND I SAW THE WORDS "STAR WARS" TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND I REMEMBER SAYING THEM ALOUD, STANDING THERE. "STAR WARS?" LIKE IT WAS SUCH A WEIRD THING. BUT IT JUST, IT FELT LIKE THERE WAS SOME KIND OF POWER IN JUST THE TITLE OF IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: AND IT JUST CHANGED EVERYTHING.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: IT WAS THE BIGGEST MOVIE.
INSANE.
Jimmy: IT'S SO EXCITING AND FUN. HOW DID YOU GET -- DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD EVER DIRECT OR HOW DID YOU GET THIS?
NO, NO, NO. OF COURSE, I NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT I WAS SORT OF AFRAID TO DO IT, MOSTLY BECAUSE I CARED ABOUT IT SO MUCH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I REMEMBER AS A KID, MY FATHER IS A TV MOVIE PRODUCER, AND HE WAS WORKING ON SOMETHING. AND AN ACTRESS HE WORKED WITH WAS ALSO STARRING IN THIS FAMILY SHOW, THIS SORT OF HIT FAMILY SHOW. IT AND SHE WILL REMAIN NAMELESS, BUT SHE INVITED ME AT AROUND 13 YEARS OLD TO GO TO THE SET OF THE SHOW. I WAS LIKE, "AW, IT'S AMAZING! LOVE THAT SHOW. I CAN'T WAIT." SO, I GO TO THE SET, AND SHE'S IN HER TRAILER, JUST GETTING STONED THE WHOLE TIME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THE OLDEST BOY IN THE SHOW IS PASSED OUT ON HIS SET BED FROM BEING UP ALL NIGHT AND DRUNK. THE LITTLE KID IN THE SHOW IS LIKE SKATEBOARDING AROUND AND ALL THE CREW MEMBERS ARE CURSING HIS NAME. THE MOTHER AND FATHER IN THE SHOW NEVER -- THEY HATED EACH OTHER. IT WAS LIKE, IT WAS DEVASTATING. I WENT HOME, ALMOST LIKE BURST INTO TEARS. I WAS LIKE SO TRAUMATIZED. AND I WAS AFRAID IF I DID "STAR WARS" AND GOT CLOSE TO IT, IT WOULD BE A HORROR SHOW AND IT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE.
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU WOULD RUIN IT FOR YOURSELF.
IT'D BE A NIGHTMARE. AND THANK GOD, IT WAS THE ABSOLUTE OPPOSITE.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
IT WAS FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: SO IT LIVED UP TO EVERY EXPECTATION.
NO IT WAS -- THE PEOPLE WERE INCREDIBLE.

Jimmy: HOW AMAZING IS THAT GUY?
BEYOND BELIEF. SO, I GO TO SEE THE SHOW WITH OUR SON, AND AT INTERMISSION, LIN- MANUEL MIRANDA, WHO WROTE IT AND CONCEIVED IT AND NORMALLY STARS IN IT, HE WASN'T IN IT THAT NIGHT, COMES UP TO ME AND HE SAYS HELLO. MY MIND IS BLOWN BECAUSE HE'S SO BRILLIANT. HE SAYS, "HEY, IF YOU NEED MUSIC FOR THE CANTINA, I'LL WRITE IT." LIKE, AND HE WALKS OFF. AND I'M LIKE, DOES HE KNOW? BASICALLY, WE HAVE A SCENE THAT'S SORT OF OUR VERSION OF THE CANTINA SCENE THAT JOHN WILLIAMS, THE MASTER COMPOSER SAID, HE'S LIKE, "J.J. BABY, I WOULD RATHER NOT WRITE THE MUSIC FOR THAT SCENE, YOU KNOW? IF YOU DON'T -- CAUSE I'D RATHER WRITE THE SCORE." HE SAYS, "J.J. BABY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I LOVE THAT.
LOVE THAT. YOU'D BE JIMMY BABY. EVERYONE'S BABY.

SO I END UP E-MAILING LIN MIRANDA AND I SAY, "I KNOW YOU WERE KIDDING, BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO WRITE THIS MUSIC, I'M ACTUALLY WORKING ON SOMETHING IF YOU WANT IT." HE'S LIKE, "I'LL DROP EVERYTHING." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, ALL RIGHT. SO, BY THE WAY, I SAW HIM ON YOUR SHOW, AND IT WAS MAYBE THE BEST TELEVISION I'VE SEEN IN LIKE THE LAST TEN YEARS. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
Jimmy: HE WAS AMAZING.
UNBELIEVABLE. UNBELIEVABLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT WAS ALL REAL BY THE WAY. A LOT PEOPLE WERE LIKE, OH, DID HE REHEARSE? HE DIDN'T REHEARSE. HE'S JUST THAT TALENTED.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I BELIEVE IT CAUSE HE'S SUCH A A GENIUS. SO, ANYWAY, HE AND I WERE SENDING BACK AND FORTH MUSIC FILES, YOU KNOW, AND HE'S SINGING AND PLAYING INSTRUMENTS. THIS WHOLE THING WAS NUTS. AND NOW IN THE MOVIE IN THIS ONE SEQUENCE IS MUSIC THAT LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA AND I WROTE AND SCORED. AND WE'D NEVER DISCUSSED THIS BEFORE.
Jimmy: I DID NOT KNOW THIS.
HE MIGHT KILL ME FOR REVEALING IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
