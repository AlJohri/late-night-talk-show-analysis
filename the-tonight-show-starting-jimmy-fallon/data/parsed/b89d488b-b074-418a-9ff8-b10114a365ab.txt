Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- VINCE VAUGHN. PATTON OSWALT. COMEDIAN, NATE BARGATZE. AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 563, IOWA!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT IS A CROWD! THAT IS A GREAT CROWD RIGHT THERE. WELCOME! LOOKING GOOD. LOOKING GOOD, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, BABY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE, YOU MADE IT! YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. WE'VE GOT A FUN SHOW FOR YOU. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. A NEW POLL FINDS THAT DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE IN A A STATISTICAL TIE JUST A WEEK FROM ELECTION DAY. BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, AT LEAST TRUMP'S FINALLY IN A TIE THAT WAS MADE IN AMERICA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO THAT'S --
Steve: OH! [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: BUT THE BIG STORY RIGHT NOW IS THE WORLD SERIES. TONIGHT WAS GAME SEVEN BETWEEN THE CHICAGO CUBS AND THE CLEVELAND INDIANS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE CUBS ACTUALLY CAME BACK FROM BEING DOWN THREE GAMES TO ONE, TO FORCE A SEVENTH GAME. THAT'S RIGHT, CLEVELAND HAD A A BIG LEAD, THEN IT DISAPPEARED. OR AS HILLARY CLINTON PUT IT, "FBI." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND GET THIS, I SAW THAT A PAIR OF TICKETS TO TONIGHT'S GAME SEVEN SOLD ON STUBHUB, FOR ALMOST $40,000. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] AND THE COUPLE STILL LEFT IN THE SEVENTH INNING TO BEAT TRAFFIC. I MEAN THAT'S JUST -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "GET YOUR PURSE, LINDA." [ LAUGHTER ] "WE'LL CATCH THE END ON THE RADIO." [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP HAVE RUN NATIONAL COMMERCIALS DURING THE WORLD SERIES GAMES. MARKING THE ONLY TIME CUBS AND INDIANS FANS WERE BOOING AT THE SAME TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE, WE'RE WATCHING THIS TO GET AWAY FROM YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, DID YOU SEE THIS? ON MONDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICIAL TWITTER ACCOUNT TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT. HILLARY WAS LIKE, "FORGET THE NUCLEAR CODES. WE CAN NOT TRUST DONALD TRUMP WITH OUR NATION'S TWITTER HANDLE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THE TWITTER HANDLE? JUST AS WE SAID BEFORE, THERE'S A WEEK UNTIL THE ELECTION, AND THE POLLS JUST KEEP COMING. IN FACT, A NEW POLL FINDS THAT 73% OF TINDER USERS SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON OVER DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH MAKES SENSE, BECAUSE PEOPLE ON TINDER ARE USED TO LOOKING AT THEIR OPTIONS AND GOING, "I GUESS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "YEAH, DO IT." WHAT DO I KNOW? I DON'T KNOW. [ APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, THERE'S PROBABLY NO ONE MORE READY FOR THE ELECTION TO BE OVER THAN THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE NEWS. SO WE REACHED OUT TO SEE WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN COVERING THIS THING FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS PLAN ON DOING ONCE IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE. AND CHECK OUT WHAT THEY SAID. MEGYN KELLY FROM FOX NEWS, SAID, "I'M GOING TO SPEND TIME WITH MY FAMILY." MSNBC'S RACHEL MADDOW, SAID, "I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CATCHING UP ON SLEEP." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NEXT, CNN'S WOLF BLITZER, SAID, "I'M GOING TO A DAY SPA IN CHINATOWN, AND GETTING A LONG MASSAGE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ THEN, NBC'S LESTER HOLT SAID, "I'M TAKING A VACATION WITH MY WIFE." NEXT, WOLF BLITZER, SAID, "THEY'LL DRIP PIPING HOT WAX ALL OVER MY BODY. THE PAIN IS EXHILARATING, AND I LOVE IT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEN, ABC'S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SAID, "I'LL JUST RELAX AT HOME AND READ." NEXT, WOLF BLITZER SAID, "AFTER THE WAX, I HANG UPSIDE DOWN LIKE A BAT, FOR FIVE HOURS WHILE THE MASSEUSE TICKLES MY FEET WITH A GIANT BOA FEATHER. MY SAFE WORD IS, 'DON'T STOP.'" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEN CHRIS WALLACE FROM FOX NEWS SAID, "I'LL GO TO THE MOVIES." AND FINALLY, WOLF BLITZER SAID, "THEN I'LL GRAB AS MANY FREE BATHROBES I CAN CARRY. SPRINT OUT OF THERE WHILE SCREAMING, 'Y'ALL JUST GOT BLITZED!'" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK HE'S LOSING HIS MIND.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: CHECK THIS OUT, APPLE'S NEW UPDATE, THEY JUST UPDATED THEIR iOS IN THE PHONE, THERE. IT ACTUALLY CHANGED THE PEACH EMOJI SO THAT IT NO LONGER LOOKS LIKE A CARTOON BUTT. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. IT USED TO LOOK LIKE THIS. AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO THAT'S MUCH BETTER. THAT'S MUCH BETTER.
Steve: THAT'S BETTER. LOOKS LIKE IT'S CRACKED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. AND FINALLY, THIS WAS KIND OF CRAZY. I SAW THAT A TECH BLOGGER IN CALIFORNIA USED A WEATHER BALLOON TO DROP AN iPHONE FROM THE EDGE OF SPACE, AT 100,000 FEET IN THE AIR TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. AND STILL, SOMEHOW THE PHONE LANDED IN THE GUY'S TOILET. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I SCREWED THAT JOKE UP. I SCREWED IT UP A LITTLE BIT. CAN I JUST READ IT AGAIN? [ LAUGHTER ] I'LL READ IT AGAIN FROM HERE. MAYBE I NEED TO BE CLOSER. THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. LET ME READ IT AGAIN. AND FINALLY, THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. I SAW THAT -- NO, DON'T LIGHT ME. I LIKE IT DARK. [ LAUGHTER ] MYSTERIOUS. MYSTERIOUS. SO THAT IF IT BOMBS AGAIN, YOU WON'T REMEMBER IT WAS ME. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY -- [ LAUGHTER ] CAN I TALK TO YOU GUYS FOR A A SECOND? THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. ♪♪ I SAW THAT IN A TECH BLOGGER IN CALIFORNIA -- [ LAUGHTER ] USED A WEATHER BALLOON TO DROP AN iPHONE FROM THE EDGE OF SPACE, 100,000 FEET IN THE AIR TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

Jimmy: WHAT WAS THAT? IS IT --
WE ARE DOING THE TURTLES ORIGINAL SAMPLE. THE SAMPLE TO THE D-NIGHT SONG.
Jimmy: WHO DOES THAT SONG?
THE TURTLES.
Jimmy: THE TURTLES?
FLO & EDDIE.
THE TERM DE-LICIOUS IS WHAT THAT WAS.
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
ALWAYS. ALWAYS.
Jimmy: I'VE GOT TO SAY, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: IT MUST BE A VERY EXCITING DAY. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME, THEY PROBABLY KNOW, WE DON'T YET.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: WHO'S GOING TO WIN THE WORLD SERIES. BUT I KNOW YOU'RE A LIFE-LONG CUBS FAN. SO THIS MUST BE SO EXCITING.
IT'S AN EXCITING TIME. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THAT WE'RE WITH GAME SEVEN.
Jimmy: YES.
SO I'M VERY EXCITED. AND I'M EXCITED TO WATCH THE GAME. IT'S A LITTLE BIT SURREAL. YOU'VE BEEN WITH THIS WITH THE RED SOX. YOU GUYS HAD A LONG DROUGHT.
Jimmy: I PLAYED -- WELL, I WAS IN THIS MOVIE "FEVER PITCH," HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE. [ APPLAUSE ]
I'M NOT HOLDING ANYTHING.
Jimmy: NO, YOU GOT TO HOLD IT BACK A LITTLE BIT. GOTTA TAKE IT DOWN A LITTLE.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. SOME FORCES CAN'T BE CONTAINED AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] ONE MORE TIME FOR "FEVER PITCH." [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: AND HONESTLY THAT WAS 86 YEARS. YOU KNOW? WEIRDLY, THEO EPSTEIN, WHO WAS RUNNING THE RED SOX THEN. HE'S NOW WITH THE CUBS. IT WAS SURREAL WHEN YOU SEE FANS THAT HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR TEAM WIN IN THAT LONG. OBVIOUSLY, I GET GOOSE BUMPS TALKING ABOUT IT. 'CUZ IT WAS LIKE --
THE RESPONSE IN BOSTON WHEN THEY DID WIN, WAS --
Jimmy: IT WASN'T SCREAMING LIKE -- IT WAS LIKE WEEPING, CRYING. PEOPLE ON THE PHONE LIKE, DAD, WE DID IT. SERIOUSLY, I'M GETTING CHOKED UP JUST THINKING ABOUT IT. THEY REALLY DID. AND YOU WOULD DRIVE DOWN THESE AWESOME STREETS IN BOSTON AND YOU WOULD SEE --
GREAT SPORTS TOWN.
Jimmy: YEAH. IN THE CEMETERIES THEY WOULD HAVE LIKE HATS AND PENNANTS ON THE GRAVE STONES BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIVE TO SEE THEIR TEAMS WIN, AND --
YEAH. YEAH. POWERFUL.
Jimmy: TONIGHT IS POWERFUL, WHETHER IT BE CLEVELAND OR CHICAGO --
I'M ON THE OTHER SIDE. I RESPECTED CLEVELAND. THEY'VE HAD A LONG DROUGHT AS WELL. IT WOULD BE EASIER IF IT WAS ANOTHER TEAM THAT HAS ALWAYS WON. IT IS INTERESTING THAT IT'S TWO. BUT BEING A CHICAGO FAN, AS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, I'M ONLY ON ONE SIDE OF THIS ARGUMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] I HOPE THERE'S TEARS AND GRAVEYARD STUFF GOING ON IN CHICAGO.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT WHAT -- DON'T WANT TO HOPE FOR THAT.
WELL I HOPE FOR THE EMOTIONS. I HOPE FOR THE EMOTIONS. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
Jimmy: I'M EMOTIONAL I DON'T EVEN HAVE A DOG IN THE FIGHT. I'M ROOTING -- EITHER WAY, I THINK PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO BE SO HAPPY.
THAT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: THE WORLD IS GOING TO BE WATCHING, AND ENJOYING THEMSELVES. AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT, GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: HOW ARE THE KIDS?
THE KIDS ARE FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: HOW WAS TRICK-OR-TREATING?
TRICK-OR-TREATING WAS AN EXCITING TIME. THEY'RE STILL. THEY'RE YOUNG ENOUGH SO THEY'RE STILL NOT REALLY IN CHARGE OF THEIR COSTUMES AND THAT, BUT THEY ENJOY IT.
Jimmy: HOW OLD --
MY DAUGHTER IS ALMOST SIX. AND MY SON IS THREE. YOUR DAUGHTERS ARE VERY YOUNG.
Jimmy: YES. THREE AND ALMOST TWO.
TWO. GOT IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, THEY HAVE NO IDEA.
BUT THEY'RE GETTING CANDY. IT'S A NICE DAY. THEY'RE PUTTING ON A COSTUME. THEY'RE EXCITED.
Jimmy: THEY CAME TO THE OFFICE AND THE LITTLE ONE'S JUST YELLING "TREAT, TREAT, TREAT" AND JUST GRABBING CANDY. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE CANDY WAS.
I LOVED TO TRICK-OR-TREAT LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.
Jimmy: EVEN AS A CHILD YOU LIKED IT?
I LIKED IT AS A KID 'CUZ THAT WAS NICE. YOU MAYBE HAVE A PARENT THEY WALK YOU AROUND AND YOU GET HOPPED UP ON THE SUGAR. ALTHOUGH, IN THE '70s, IT WAS DIFFERENT. IT WAS JUST A BASELINE OF SUGAR. I MEAN YOU WERE HAVING SUGAR CEREALS EVERY DAY. YOU WOULD DRINK TANG. TANG HAD SUGAR IN IT PROBABLY.
Jimmy: OH YEAH.
SO THERE WOULD BE A SMALL SPIKE YOU KNOW? YOU WOULD CONSTANTLY HAVE A A BASELINE OF SUGAR. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TODAY, THESE KIDS WHEN THEY HAVE SUGAR IT'S LIKE THEY'RE ALL EATING KALE ALL DAY. THEY'RE GOING OUT OF THEIR MINDS. RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO, IT'S A BIGGER SWING.
Jimmy: IT'S A SPIKE.
IT'S A SPIKE. WE HAD THAT BIG LEAGUE CHEW. SUCKING DOWN BIG LEAGUE CHEW. IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?
Jimmy: I USED TO HAVE SUGAR ALL DAY LONG.
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE CHEWING TABACCO, WITH BIG LEAGUE CHEW, A WAD OF GUM IN YOUR MOUTH. THAT WAS JUST A NORMAL DAY. IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT ONCE YOU GET TO BE OLDER AND YOU GO OUT BY YOURSELF, LIKE ONCE YOU GET TO BE NINE OR TEN, AND YOU'RE KIND OF ON YOUR OWN MOVING AROUND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A PACK OF OTHER NINE OR TEN-YEAR-OLDS, IT BECOMES AN EXCITING TIME.
Jimmy: OH YEAH.
DID YOU DO THAT?
Jimmy: NOT REALLY. I MEAN, A LITTLE BIT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? HOW DO YOU A LITTLE BIT DO THAT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I REMEMBER THE IDEA OF DOING IT. I WAS VERY OVERPROTECTIVE -- MY PARENTS WERE VERY OVERPROTECTIVE.
THEY WERE?
Jimmy: I NEVER GOT TO LEAVE --
WELL YOU TURNED OUT GREAT. BUT OVERPROTECTIVE IN WHAT WAY?
Jimmy: I NEVER REALLY GOT TO LEAVE MY BACKYARD AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHO ARE YOU? WERE YOU IN THE AMISH COUNTRY OF PENNSYLVANIA?
Jimmy: NO, I WAS NOT. I WAS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. A GREAT PLACE. SOCRATES, NEW YORK. YEP.
RESPECT.
Jimmy: YEAH. RESPECT. IT WAS LIKE A CHAIN LINK FENCE FROM ME AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
HOW BIG WAS THE YARD? SUBURBAN YARD? HOW MUCH ACREAGE?
Jimmy: HALF AN ACRE MAYBE.
THAT'S NOT BAD.
Jimmy: YEAH, NOT BAD.
BUT IT'S A SMALL CONFINED AREA FOR A YOUNG IRISH FALCON TO BE CONTAINED LIKE THAT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: FOR A YOUNG IRISH FALCON.
YEAH.
THEY SAW THE BEAUTY IN THIS IRISH FALCON AND THEY PUT HIM IN A GUILDED CAGE. I DON'T KNOW WHY. WHY WERE THEY SO SELFISH TO KEEP YOUR WINGS FOR THEM.
Jimmy: I THINK -- I DON'T KNOW. I THINK MY PARENTS -- I THINK THEY KIND OF CRATE TRAINED ME.
UH-HUH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S A NEW THING. IN THE '70S, THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
CRATE TRAINING.
Jimmy: THEY CRATE TRAINED FOR CHILDREN.
SO WHEN YOU WERE 11, DID YOU GO OUT ON YOUR OWN TO GET SOME CANDY?
Jimmy: I REMEMBER I DID ONCE. IT WAS MORE ABOUT LIKE, LIKE VANDALISM.
THAT'S RIGHT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD EXPECT FROM A YOUNG FALCON. NOT A GOOD THING TO DO, BUT YOU'RE LEARNING, YOU'RE PUSHING BOUNDARIES. DID YOU EVER GO TO A HOUSE AND THEY WOULD HAVE THE CANDY OUT THAT WOULD "SAY PLEASE JUST TAKE ONE?"
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
Jimmy: I'D TAKE ONE.
YOU WOULD?
Jimmy: PROBABLY, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S WHY WE LOVE THE FALCON.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT'S WHY WE LOVE THE IRISH FALCON.
Jimmy: THE IRISH FALCON. I WOULD GO BY THE RULES. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER] I REMEMBER LIKE SHAVING CREAM --
ME AND MY FRIENDS THERE WOULD BE NO MORE CANDY.
Jimmy: YOU'D TAKE THE WHOLE THING?
WE DID. HEY, THIS IS GREAT. THERE'S A WHOLE THING OF REESE'S. THOSE ARE GOOD ONES TO GET.
Jimmy: YEAH, IF YOU JUST TAKE THE WHOLE THING.
IF IT WAS JUST AN APPLE, THERE WOULD BE A TRICK PLAYED ON THE HOUSE.
Jimmy: OH YEAH?
DID YOU EVER PLAY TRICKS? IT IS TRICK-OR-TREAT.
Jimmy: THAT IS TRUE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OPTION. I THOUGHT IT WAS THEIR CHOICE.
THEY WERE GONNA TRICK YOU?
Jimmy: I SAID LOOK -- I LOVE MAGIC.
OKAY.
Jimmy: I'M A FAN. I GO TRICK-OR-TREAT, I'LL TAKE EITHER ONE.
PLEASE LEVITATE.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. YOU COULD BE DAVID BLAINE. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO RING THE BELL. THE GUY IS A PROFESSIONAL MAGICIAN. AND HE'S LIKE, "YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE, I'VE GOT A TRICK FOR YOU." IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO VEGAS. I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. IN UPSTATE NEW YORK OF ALL PLACES. I'M GONNA GET A TRICK.
IT WAS AN ODD CONVERSATION. YOU'RE LAYING IN BED AT NIGHT, YOU'RE SCARED TO OPEN UP TO YOUR PARENTS. AND YOUR MOM WOULD BE SITTING THERE WITH YOU. AND SAY, "HOW WAS HALLOWEEN, FALCON?" YOU WOULD SAY, "WELL, IT WAS OKAY." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT WAS OKAY? YOU GOT LOTS OF CANDY?" "YEAH, LOTS OF CANDY." "WHAT COULD HAVE MADE IT BETTER?" "NO ONE DID A TRICK." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NOT ONE, YEAH.
WHEN YOU SAW "THE BOY IN THE BUBBLE," WHAT DID YOU THINK? [ LAUGHTER ] WERE YOU LIKE FINALLY SOMEONE GETS ME? DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT YOUR LIFE STORY? OR WERE YOU LIKE, THAT'S HOW EVERYONE GROWS UP? EVERYONE IS IN THE BUBBLE.
Jimmy: THE YOUNG JOHN TRAVOLTA.
THE YOUNG JOHN TRAVOLTA.
Jimmy: NO, BUT I REMEMBERED I HAD A TRICK-OR-TREAT BAG THAT WAS PURCHASED, LIKE A PLASTIC BAG.
A PLASTIC BAG. THAT'S NICE. A PILLOWCASE IS A STURDIER FOR CANDY. BUT HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU. THERE'S NO JUDGMENT. IT'S A FANTASTIC CHILDHOOD IS WHAT YOU HAD. YOU HAD VERY CARING PARENTS I BET THEY'RE GREAT GRANDPARENTS.
Jimmy: YEAH. THEY ARE. I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS.
NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT AT ALL? I THINK IT'S JUST LIKE EVERYONE'S GOT A UNIQUE WAY TO THE WATERFALL, BUT WE'RE ALL DRINKING. WE'RE ALL DRINKING.
Jimmy: LET ME WRITE THAT ONE DOWN. THAT'S A GOOD -- THAT'S MY YEARBOOK QUOTE. THAT WAS MY YEARBOOK QUOTE. LET'S TALK ABOUT "HACKSAW RIDGE", PLEASE. BECAUSE, MAN-O-MAN THIS IS WHY I LOVE YOU. YOU'RE FUNNY, BUT YOU'RE ALSO -- YOU'RE A GREAT ACTOR. AND IN THIS MOVIE YOU GET TO BE BOTH. YOU'RE KIND OF SARCASTIC WHEN YOU HAVE TO BE, AND YOU'RE A A BAD ASS, YOU'RE A HARD ASS IN CERTAIN THINGS. AND IT'S BASED ON A TRUE STORY.
IT'S ABOUT THIS GUY, WORLD WAR II VETERAN NAMED DESMOND DOSS WHO WANTED TO GO AND SERVE AND BE A MEDIC BUT REFUSED TO CARRY A GUN. THEN WENT TO OKINAWA, WHICH IS ONE OF THE ROUGHEST BATTLES THAT WAS IN THE PACIFIC. AND ONE NIGHT DRAGGED 75 MEN COMPLETELY UNARMED, WOULD GO OUT BY HIMSELF, INTO THE BATTLE, AND BRING WOUNDED PEOPLE BACK IN. WHEN I FIRST READ THIS, I THOUGHT, THIS IS CRAZY. I'D NEVER HEARD OF THIS STORY. THERE'S DOCUMENTARIES AND STUFF ON IT. IT'S COMPLETELY TRUE. SO IT WAS A POWERFUL STORY ABOUT A GUY WITH CONVICTION, THAT REALLY KIND OF STAYED TRUE TO HIMSELF. ANDREW GARFIELD IS UNBELIEVABLE.
Jimmy: GREAT!
ISN'T HE GREAT IN IT? HE'S A TERRIFIC ACTOR.
Jimmy: I KNOW ANDREW AND WHEN HE COMES ON THE SHOW, HE'S LIKE, [ IMITATING ANDREW GARFIELD ] "HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?" HE DOESN'T REALLY TALK LIKE THAT, BUT HE'S BRITISH.
PRETTY GOOD.
Jimmy: BUT MAN HE DOES A A GREAT ACCENT IN THIS AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA THAT HE'S ENGLISH. I THOUGHT THE GIRL WAS FANTASIC TOO.
THERESA PALMER IS FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: THERESA PALMER.
THE LOVE STORY IN THE BEGINNING IS REALLY TERRIFIC. YOUNG INNOCENT LOVE IS VERY, VERY POWERFUL.
Jimmy: YOU ALSO FORGET HOW YOUNG THESE SOLDIERS WERE IN WORLD WAR II.
YEAH, THEY'RE BABIES. HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OUR TRICK-OR-TREATING NIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THESE GENTLEMEN WERE GOING ON AND FIGHTING.
Jimmy: IT'S INTENSE BUT IT'S GREAT. AND YOU'RE GETTING GREAT REVIEWS. CONGRATS ON EVERYTHING.

GENTLEMEN! I WANT YOU TO MEET PRIVATE DESMOND DOSS. APPARENTLY PRIVATE DOSS DOES NOT BELIEVE IN VIOLENCE. HE DOES NOT PRACTICE VIOLENCE. HE WILL NOT EVEN DEIGN TO TOUCH A WEAPON. YOU SEE, PRIVATE DOSS IS A A CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR. SO I PLEAD WITH YOU, DO NOT LOOK TO HIM TO SAVE YOU ON THE BATTLEFIELD. BECAUSE HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE TOO BUSY WRESTLING WITH HIS CONSCIENCE TO ASSIST --
SARGE, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
PRIVATE, AS YOU WERE! NOW, I REALIZE SOME OF YOU MIGHT HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS. IT IS WHAT WE MEANT FIGHT FOR. TO DEFEND OUR RIGHTS, AND TO PROTECT OUR WOMEN AND CHILDREN. EVEN IF PRIVATE DOSS BELIEFS IT MIGHT CAUSE WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO DIE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: NO, DON'T DO THAT PLEASE. YOU WENT ALL OUT --
THE THING WAS, SHE WANTED TO BE RAVEN FROM "TEEN TITANS GO." BECAUSE SHE LOVES THAT CARTOON. AND THEN SHE GOES, YOU'VE GOT TO BE RAVEN'S DAD, WHO IS THIS DEMON NAMED TRIGON, SO --
Jimmy: I MEAN THIS IS NOT BAD. THAT'S YOUR DAD? HOW AWESOME IS THAT. HOW COOL IS YOUR DAD. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU DID THIS LAST YEAR, TOO.
WELL, I DID THIS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND IT KIND OF BACKFIRED, BECAUSE SHE SAID, I WANT TO BE SPIDERGIRL, AND YOU HAVE TO BE DR. OCTOPUS. SHE WAS THREE.
Jimmy: DR. OCTOPUS.
OCTOPUS. AND THERE'S NO DR. OCTOPUS COSTUMES. BUT LUCKILY, SHE SAID IT TO ME ON OCTOBER 1st. AND THEN I RAN INTO -- THE NEXT DAY I RAN INTO ADAM SAVAGE FROM "MYTHBUSTERS." AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HALLOWEEN AND I TOLD HIM LIKE, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE AN -- AND HE GOES, I'LL MAKE YOU A A DR. OCTOPUS COSTUME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I'M LIKE ARE YOU SURE?

Jimmy: I'VE GOT TO SHOW THIS.
WHICH HE SENDS TO ME.
Jimmy: LOOK AT THIS THING.
HOLY MOLY. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT IS THE BEST COSTUME I'VE EVER SEEN.
WELL, OKAY. YES, IT WAS A GREAT COSTUME, BUT THE MINUTE IT ARRIVED, I GO, HEY, I'VE GOT MY DR. OCTOPUS COSTUME. SHE WAS LIKE, OH, I WANT TO BE DOROTHY FROM "WIZARD OF OZ" AND YOU HAVE TO BE THE LION. SHE TOTALLY CHANGED HER MIND. SO, I MADE HER TAKE THIS PICTURE. AND THE MINUTE WE WERE DONE, SHE TOOK HER SPIDERGIRL OUTFIT OFF AND GOES I WANT TO BE DOROTHY. I HAD TO RUN OUT AND GET A LION COSTUME WHICH I COULDN'T FIND. BUT I FOUND ONE, I THINK IT WAS KIND OF LIKE AN ADULT ONE. 'CAUSE IT WAS A LION COSTUME BUT THERE WERE NO ARMS. IT WAS THIS WEIRD SLEEVELESS -- AND MY ARMS, LIKE MY BARE ARMS, IT LOOKS LIKE TWO BIG TUBES OF VANILLA COOKIE DOUGH. LIKE IT DID NOT LOOK -- IT LOOKED LIKE -- IT LOOKED LIKE A LION, AND A WEIRD SCIENTIST WAS LIKE WOULDN'T IT BE NICE, A WORLD IF LIONS HAD COOKIE DOUGH ARMS? [ LAUGHTER ] SO THEN I WAS LIKE WALKING AND THE OTHER ADULTS WERE LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DRESSED -- IT WAS THE CREEPIEST -- YEAH, AND I WAS JUST LIKE SKEEVING EVERYONE OUT ON THE BLOCK.
Jimmy: AND LIKE I HAVE THE BEST COSTUME AT HOME RIGHT NOW, I'M DR. OCTOPUS.

Jimmy: PUDDING ARMS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. CONGRATULATIONS FOR THIS.
OH, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU'RE DOING A A SPECIAL RELEASE ON VINYL, WHICH I THINK IS SO FUN.
I LOVE -- THIS IS SO FOR ME. ALL OF MY FIRST COMEDY ALBUMS WERE ON VINYL. YOURS WERE ON VINYL, RIGHT?
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
WHAT WERE THE -- WHAT WERE THE ONES -- WHAT WERE YOUR -- WHAT WERE YOUR BIG ONES?
Jimmy: I HAD SMOTHERS BROTHERS WERE BIG. RODNEY DANGERFIELD, "NO RESPECT."
YOU HAD NO -- SEE, "NO RESPECT", AND THE FLIP SIDE WAS "SON OF NO RESPECT." REMEMBER THE TWO SIDES OF THE ALBUM?
Jimmy: OH, RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU WOULD LISTEN TO THOSE.
Jimmy: I WOULD MEMORIZE RODNEY DANGERFIELD. I USE TO HAVE A RECORD PLAYER IN MY ROOM. BUT MY PARENTS, AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER, THEY WERE VERY OVERPROTECTIVE. MY DAD WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE A A KEY AND HE WOULD SCRATCH OUT THE CURSE WORDS.
HANG ON --
Jimmy: SO --
THAT MEANT HE HAD TO SIT AND LISTEN TO THE ALBUM AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THE CURSE WORDS CAME --
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND STOP AND THEN BACK IT UP SCRATCH OUT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT'S HORRIBLE, YET DEDICATED PARENTING.
Jimmy: ALSO IT KIND OF SCREWED UP ALL THE JOKES.
OH, REALLY?
MY DOCTOR AND ALL OF A A SUDDEN IT GOES -- AND A PAUSE. AND YOU GO DOCTOR? THAT'S NOT A JOKE. YOU'RE THINKING, COMEDY IS A A CINCH.
Jimmy: IT'S SO EASY TO DO.
BUT FOLKS, MY SHOES -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: IT WORKS. IT STILL WORKS. IT STILL WORKS.
Jimmy: I'M HAPPY THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT. BECAUSE ANY PERSON OUT THERE THAT LOVES STAND-UP, YOU'LL LOVE THIS "TALKING FOR CLAPPING."
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND WHEN YOU WON -- WHEN YOU WON THE EMMY, GOSH, EVERYONE WAS SO HAPPY FOR YOU. I WAS IN THERE. WE WATCHED YOU GET UP THERE. IT WAS VERY EMOTIONAL, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS YEAR'S BEEN TOUGH.
THIS YEAR HAS NOT BEEN FUN. THAT WAS A MOMENT WHERE, I MEAN, I WENT INTO THE EMMY'S VERY RELAXED AND HAPPY WITH, OH TIG, OR AMY WILL WIN. AND I'M TOTALLY COOL WITH THAT. AND WHEN THEY CALL MY NAME, YOU SEE IT -- I HAVE NO SPEECH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY. I ALMOST BREAK DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT BECAUSE I REALIZE I'M NOT GOING TO GET TO HANG OUT WITH MY WIFE, MICHELLE, AFTERWARD, BECAUSE SHE PASSED IN APRIL. THEN I'VE GOT TO KIND OF RECOMPOSE MYSELF AND THANK MORE PEOPLE. THEN I THANK HER AT THE END. NOW I'M -- IT'S 6 MONTHS AND 12 DAYS ON. AND MAN, GRIEF IS -- THE THING ABOUT GRIEF IS, IT LIKES IT'S SURPRISES. SO, A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO IF I STARTED TO CRY OR HAVE A MOMENT WHERE I MISSED HER, IT WAS FOR A REASON LIKE, OH, SHE LOVED THIS WILCO SONG, OR, OH -- YOU KNOW, THAT I REMEMBER US TAKING THIS DRIVE. NOW GRIEF WILL MAKE ME CRY AT -- I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I'M DOING IT. BECAUSE IT SO KNOWS ALL THE TRIGGERS. BUT IT WANTS TO SURPRISE ME SO I'LL BE LIKE WAITING -- I WAS WAITING FOR AN APP TO UPDATE. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THEN I STARTED CRYING THINKING, THERE'S APPS ON HER PHONE THAT WILL NEVER UPDATE AGAIN. LIKE, IT WAS THE DUMBEST THING. SO NOW I'M LIKE, I'M LIKE THE HULK OF CRYING. LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M GOING TO HULK OUT CRYING, AND IT WILL BE FOR NOTHING.
Jimmy: WHEN IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN?
YEAH, WHEN WILL IT HAPPEN? LIKE I'LL GET SOME DIM SUM. AND THEN YOU GO DIM SUM MY LIFE IS ACTUALLY DIM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'M JUST EATING -- SO IT'S JUST SUCKS.
Jimmy: I JUST WANT TO SAY WE LOVE YOU HERE. AND ALL OF OUR FANS. IT'S TOUGH OUT THERE TO DEAL WITH THIS GRIEF. BUT ALSO TO CONTINUE TO GO OUT AND MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH. BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED A LAUGH.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WE LOVE YOU, BUDDY.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WE LOVE YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU'RE A TOUGH DUDE. YOU'RE A GOOD DAD, TOO.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: PATTON OSWALT. GO SEE HIM AT THE BEACON THEATER! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH COMEDIAN NATE BARGATZE, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST IS ONE OF MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE COMEDIANS, AND A REGULAR HERE ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW." YOU CAN SEE HIM THIS WEEK DURING THE NEW YORK COMEDY FESTIVAL AS WELL AS THE STAND THIS SATURDAY. EVERYBODY, PLEASE WELCOME, THE VERY FUNNY NATE BARGATZE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THAT WAS -- IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. ALRIGHT. I'VE DONE COMEDY FOR A WHILE, I'VE DONE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SHOWS. THEY'RE NOT, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT ALL AS EXCITING AS "THE TONIGHT SHOW." I DID ONE IN A PRISON ONCE. LIKE, IN IT. LIKE, ALL THE WAY IN IT. LIKE, WE WENT TO THEM. LIKE, WE DIDN'T MEET 'EM OUT, YOU KNOW? SO WE GO IN. LET'S SAY YOU GUYS ARE THE INMATES. SO I'M SITTING HERE, I'M LIKE DOING MY DUMB JOKES. NONE OF IT WORKS. EVERY JOKE I HAVE INVOLVES BEING OUTSIDE IN THE PAST 30 YEARS. LIKE, JUST -- I'M LIKE, TRAFFIC'S CRAZY. YOU GUYS REMEMBER. WHO REMEMBERS? PEOPLE REMEMBER TRAFFIC HERE, RIGHT? SO I'M DOING MY DUMB JOKES. AND THEN AN INMATE GETS UP AND STARTS WALKING TOWARD ME. AND I'M LIKE, OH, BOY, HERE WE GO. YOU KNOW, LIKE, HE'S GOING TO USE ME TO BREAK OUT. AND I DON'T WANT TO POINT AT HIM. BUT NO ONE'S LIKE LOOKING. BUT I AM USING HAND GESTURES. I 'M LIKE, WHAT DO YOU GUYS DO ON THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM? SHOULD HE BE WALKING UP LIKE THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] TURNS OUT THE BATHROOMS ARE BEHIND ME. HE'S A GOOD GUY. I JUDGED HIM ON WHAT HE WAS WEARING AND WHERE WE WERE AT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS MY FAULT. SO I'M LIKE AGAINST A BRICK WALL. AND IT GOES LIKE HALFWAY UP. AND THE URINALS ARE ALL BEHIND HERE. SO THEN HE COMES TO USE THE BATHROOM, AND HE COMES TO THE URINAL RIGHT BEHIND ME. SO THEN IT'S JUST ME AND HIM JUST LOOKING AT EVERYBODY. AND HE PEED. HE PEED WITHOUT EVEN -- IT WAS THE MOST CONFIDENCE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I THOUGHT, WHATEVER YOU THINK THIS GUY DID, THIS GUY DID IT. ALRIGHT? THAT'S NOT -- AN INNOCENT MAN DOESN'T PEE LIKE THAT. THAT'S A GUILTY, I'M NOT GETTING OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] I TOOK SOCIAL MEDIA OFF MY PHONE. IT'S TOO MUCH. LIKE YOU JUST -- YOU KNOW, YOU WALK AROUND AND JUST LOOK AT IT ALL DAY. FACEBOOK, THEY DID A REAL GOOD JOB. IT'S A REAL GOOD COMPANY. AND FACEBOOK IS JUST TOO MUCH. EVERYBODY'S SEEING EVERYBODY'S BEST OR WORST DAYS OF THEIR LIVES. YOU KNOW? YOU'RE EITHER LIKE "I'M GETTING MARRIED", OR "MY HOUSE IS ON FIRE." NO ONE'S LIKE, "TODAY'S NORMAL, NOTHING HAPPENED. I HAVE NO STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT ANYTHING." MY WIFE GETS MAD BECAUSE, SHE'S LIKE, "YOU DON'T LIKE ANY OF MY PHOTOS ON FACEBOOK." AND IT'S LIKE, IS THIS NOT ENOUGH JUST US BEING MARRIED AND LIVING TOGETHER? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LIKE, YOU KNOW -- HOW MUCH -- AND I DID LIKE IT. WHEN WE TOOK IT, I SAID, I LIKE THAT PHOTO. I TOLD YOU THAT. I'M IN THE PHOTO. THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE THAN I CAN DO IN THIS PHOTO'S LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR TEN YEARS, AND WE STILL FIGHT. LIKE, YOU CAN -- WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED, FIGHTING IS OPEN 24 HOURS. ANYTIME. WE GOT IN A FIGHT RECENTLY AT 3:00 A.M. WE WOKE UP TO GET IN THIS FIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE HAVE -- WE LIVE IN NASHVILLE. WE HAVE A DOG THAT FREAKS OUT WHEN IT THUNDERS. SO IT WAS THUNDERING. SO WE HAVE SEDATIVES TO GIVE HER, BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY TIMES YOU CAN TELL A DOG IT'S JUST THUNDER BEFORE YOU'RE LIKE "JUST TAKE THIS." I HOPE THIS WORKS. I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD YOU THROUGH IT, YOU KNOW. SO I WAKE UP, AND I ASKED MY WIFE, "HEY, WHERE ARE THE SEDATIVES AT?" SHE'S LIKE, "THEY'RE AT THE TOP OF THE CABINET." SO I GO GET THEM. WHEN I GET THEM I LOOK AT THE BOTTLE. THE BOTTLE SAID THEY WERE EXPIRED. SO I HAD TO WAKE HER BACK UP. I WAS LIKE, "HEY, THESE SAY THEY'RE EXPIRED." SHE WAS ANNOYED. SHE WAS LIKE, "THEY'RE NOT EXPIRED. THOSE ARE NEW PILLS IN AN OLD PILL BOTTLE." AND I WAS LIKE, "ALRIGHT." I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT. THAT'S MY FAULT. [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE COME TO OUR HOUSE ALL THE TIME AND THEY GET MILK, AND THEY'RE LIKE, "IS THAT MILK EXPIRED?" AND I HAVE TO GO, "THAT'S NEW MILK IN AN OLD MILK JUG. ARE YOU THE STUPIDEST PERSON I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE? HOW COULD YOU NOT FIGURE THAT OUT?" THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT I TOLD HER. IT WASN'T AS FUN AS THAT, YOU KNOW. BUT THAT WAS THE GIST. AND INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING, YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT'S A LOGICAL STATEMENT, SHE DIVES ALL IN, AND TELLS ME, "IT DOESN'T MATTER, THE DOG MEDICINE CAN'T EVEN EXPIRE." SHE HASN'T EVEN HEARD A RUMOR ABOUT THAT. SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT. WE DON'T KNOW ANY DOG MEDICINE PEOPLE. I KNOW WHO SHE KNOWS. WE DON'T KNOW ONE DOG MEDICINE MAKER THAT'S LIKE, TEXTING HER. "LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE SECRET ABOUT DOG MEDICINE. WE INVENTED MEDICINE THAT CAN'T EXPIRE." ALRIGHT, GUYS, THANK YOU SO MUCH! I APPRECIATE IT! YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
