WHY WOULD I?
Jimmy: WHY WOULD YOU. YEAH, YOU'RE JIMMY BUFFETT, WHY WOULD YOU OWN SOCKS?
EVEN IN COLD WEATHER -- IT HAS TO BE REALLY COLD TO WEAR SOCKS.
Jimmy: YEAH. EVERY TIME I SEE YOU, YEAH I KNOW -- BECAUSE YOU FLY -- LAST TIME I SAW YOU IN NEW YORK, YOU FLEW AND LANDED IN THE WATER AND THEN CAME TO THE SHOW. HOW COOL?
BUT YOU HAVE TO WEAR SHOES TO DO THAT.
Jimmy: RIGHT. YEAH.
YOU CANNOT LAND IN FLIP FLOPS.
Jimmy: YOU CANNOT.
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY ON THE PEDALS. BUT I BROUGHT YOU A PAIR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THESE ARE BIG.
Jimmy: I HAVE BIG FEET.
I KNOW IT. YOU COULD WATER-SKI IN THESE. TAKE THEM OUT TO THE PARK.

Jimmy: TASTY BEVERAGE. IS THAT YOUR -- IS THAT YOUR DRINK OF CHOICE? DO YOU ONLY DRINK MARGARITAS?
WELL, I DID FOR A LONG TIME, BECAUSE EVERYBODY BOUGHT THEM FOR ME FOR FREE. AND THEN AFTER A WHILE, I WENT TO CLEAR BURNING FUEL -- I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GOING TO LAST THIS LONG OR THE SONG WOULD. SO IT'S A LITTLE CLEANER-BURNING FUEL, JUST TEQUILA AND ICE.
