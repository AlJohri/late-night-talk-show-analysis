WELL, LET'S GET TO THE NEWS. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT HERE. THERE ARE RUMORS IN WASHINGTON THIS WEEK THAT JOE BIDEN WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE WAY THE WHITE HOUSE FORCED THE RESIGNATION OF DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK HAGEL. BECAUSE THE TWO APPARENTLY ARE GOOD FRIENDS. BIDEN STRONGLY DENIED THAT HE'S UNHAPPY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION, WHILE HAGEL STRONGLY DENIED HE'S FRIENDS WITH JOE BIDEN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "WE AREN'T THAT GOOD OF FRIENDS. WE SEE EACH OTHER IN THE HALLWAY." PEOPLE ARE SAYING BIDEN WAS UPSET WITH HOW THEY HANDLED HAGEL'S RESIGNATION, ESPECIALLY THE PART WHERE THEY TOLD BIDEN HAGEL WAS JUST GOING TO LIVE ON A FARM UPSTATE. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? LITTLE BIT OF A SCANDAL HERE. MY MAN BILLY JOEL, BILLY JOEL IS DENYING RUMORS THAT DURING A A RECENT VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE, PRESIDENT OBAMA OFFERED HIM A CIGARETTE EVEN THOUGH HE SUPPOSEDLY QUIT BACK IN 2009. BUT JOEL DID CONFIRM THAT THE PRESIDENT IS QUICK WITH A JOKE OR TO LIGHT UP YOUR SMOKE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME PLACE THAT HE'D RATHER BE.
