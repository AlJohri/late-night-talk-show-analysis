Jimmy: THAT'S EVEN WEIRDER.
YEAH.
Jimmy: DO YOU STILL HAVE THE PIN?
I DO. I HAVE ALL THREE. BECAUSE IT WAS EVERY MEMBER OF THE BAND.
Jimmy: THAT'S PRETTY COOL MAN. AWESOME. AND THEN YOU GUYS BECAME FRIENDS OR DID YOU THINK THAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO COMEDY TOGETHER?
I THINK PRETTY INSTANTLY WE BECAME FRIENDS.
Jimmy: DID YOU WANT TO DO A A MUSICAL? LIKE A JOINTED, MAKE IT DO A A BAND THING TOGETHER? DO A MUSIC THING TOGETHER? BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE VERY MUSICAL.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA DO. BUT THEN WE ENDED UP MAKING THESE LITTLE VIDEOS AND THEN THAT TURNED INTO "PORTLANDIA."
Jimmy: GOSH, I LOVE "PORTLANDIA." IT'S SUCH A FUN SHOW TO WATCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THE SHOW. IT'S SO FUN AND REFRESHING AND COOL. I SAID LAST TIME, YOU WERE NOT HERE BUT FRED WAS HERE, THE BRUNCH EPISODE. IT GOES UP THERE WITH ONE OF MY FAVORITE EPISODES. THE ONLINE EXTENDED ONE WITH --
YEAH.
YES.
Jimmy: IT'S AN EXTENDED DOCUMENTARY OF HOW THEY MADE THE CHOICE TO PUT WHAT --
MARIONBERRY.
Jimmy: MARIONBERRY TO PUT ON THE --
THAT'S A REAL BERRY, BY THE WAY.
Jimmy: ON THE PANCAKES. IS IT A REAL BERRY?
YEAH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
IT'S A REAL THING. WE'RE NOT LYING.
Jimmy: I KNOW. I WOULDN'T THINK THAT YOU ARE LYING. BUT I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU -- DO PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU ON THE STREET, IT'S SEASON 5 NOW. YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME. DO THEY COME UP AND THEY KNOW YOU AND THEY KNOW THE CHARACTERS? YOU'RE UBER FAMOUS AFTER SOMETHING DIFFERENT. NOT "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE?" NOT SLEATER-KINNEY.
YEAH, THEY QUOTE THE SHOW. IT'S VERY FLATTERING. STRANGE.
I WASN'T, THIS IS A LITTLE UNRELATED, BUT I WAS IN DISNEYLAND. AND I -- [ LAUGHTER ] THIS FAMILY WAS LIKE LOOKING AT ME, THEY'RE FROM INDIA, I GATHERED AFTERWARDS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THE DAD COMES UP TO ME AND HE'S LIKE, I'M NOT GOING TO DO THE ACCENT. HE SAYS, "I THINK YOU'RE REALLY GREAT IN 'HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS.'" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THIS IS RECENT. THIS IS RECENT.
Jimmy: HOW RECENT?
NO, IT WAS THIS YEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHY HE THOUGHT THAT WAS A NEW MOVIE OR IF I'M FROM THAT TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: INTERESTING. WELL THAT'S COOL. YOU GOT A LITTLE RICK MORANIS SHOUT OUT.
I SAID THANK YOU.
Jimmy: TALENTED GUY, MAN. HE ACUTALLY DOES MUSIC, TOO, RICK MORANIS. YOU SHOULD DO A BIT WITH HIM. THAT WOULD BE KIND OF FUNNY. DOES EVERYONE HAVE A FAVORITE CHARACTER, THE LIBRARIANS, I FEEL THAT'S TOO BIG. THAT ONE WOULD KINDA TAKE OFF.
FEMINIST BOOK STORE ONE.
Jimmy: FEMINIST BOOK STORE.
WOMEN AND WOMEN FIRST. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: THEY OWN A FEMINIST BOOK STORE. I'M LAUGHING BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THIS CLIP IS VERY FUNNY. THIS IS HOW THEY MEET. THIS SEASON IS A LOT OF THESE CHARACTER'S BACK STORIES. OH, MY GOODNESS, IS THIS THE SILLIEST THING EVER. THEY MEET AT A DANCE CLUB.
IN THE '90s.
Jimmy: IN THE 90'S. A LOT OF GREAT MUSIC IN THE '90s. A LOT OF GREAT LOOKS, HAIRSTYLES, PANT SUITS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT --
THEY'RE BUSINESS WOMEN. I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP. HERE'S FRED ARMISEN AND CARRIE BROWNSTEIN IN THE NEW SEASON OF "PORTLANDIA." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. ♪♪
OH, LOOK. THAT'S THAT TONI GIRL.
OH, THERE'S CANDACE.
HI. WE SEE YOU, YOU'RE MAKING A A FOOL OF YOURSELF. PATHETIC, ISN'T SHE?
PROBABLY ON HER FIFTH DRINK ALREADY.
ISN'T THAT THE WORST?
WHY DON'T YOU CALL HER OVER? SEE IF SHE CAN FALL DOWN ON THE FLOOR.
YEAH. THEN SHE'LL FALL RIGHT DOWN. CANDACE!
ME? ♪♪ ♪ I'VE GOT THE POWER YEAH YEAH YEAH I'VE GOT THE POWER YEAH YEAH YEAH ♪ ♪ I'VE GOT THE POWER WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA ♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I MEAN -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FRED ARMISEN, CARRIE BROWNSTEIN. THE NEW SEASON OF "PORTLANDIA" PREMIERES THURSDAY AT 10:00 P.M. ON IFC. WE'LL HAVE STAND UP FROM SIMON AMSTELL NEXT. COME ON BACK, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST IS AN AWARD-WINNING BRITISH COMEDIAN WHO IS HERE TONIGHT TO KICK OFF THE U.S. TOUR OF HIS NEW SHOW ENTITLED "TO BE FREE." PLEASE WELCOME SIMON AMSTELL. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU. GOSH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WOW. WOW. THIS IS -- IT'S TOO MUCH, IT'S TOO MUCH. I LOVE AMERICA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. I REALLY, I REALLY DO. BECAUSE EVERY TIME I COME HERE I FEEL SO WELCOMED AND SAFE. IT'S TRUE. YOU GUYS, YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO TREAT WHITE PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] IN ENGLAND WE HAVE A QUEEN. AND, NOT IN THE PAST. RIGHT NOW. [ APPLAUSE ] TO ME, WHAT IS FASCINATING ABOUT HER IS SHE IS NOT EMBARRASSED. SHE WALKS INTO ROOMS, PEOPLE STAND UP, THERE ARE TRUMPETS. I THINK IF THAT WAS ME I'D END UP SAYING, "OH NO YOU MUSN'T, IT'S RIDICULOUS." [ LAUGHTER ] SHE STANDS THERE AND SHE THINKS, "YES, THIS IS APPROPRIATE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I WAS BORN." AND IT ANGERS ME THAT PEOPLE LOVE HER AND THEY'RE INTERESTED IN THE FAMILY, PEOPLE LOVE THE QUEEN. I THINK I PREFERRED IT WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT SHE MURDERED DIANA. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] MIXED REACTION, SOME OF YOU WERE RIGHT. I ALSO FEEL WORRIED FOR HER, BECAUSE SHE IS A PERSON IN THE WORLD, AND SO THERE MUST BE SO MUCH DENIAL IN HER LIFE. SHE MUST WAKE UP EVERY MORNING, PASSED SOME STOOLS AND THEN HAS TO PRETEND THAT THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED. BECAUSE IF SHE'S JUST A PERSON WHO DOES THAT, THOSE TRUMPETS ARE GOING TO START TO SOUND SARCASTIC. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I ALSO CAN'T QUITE BELIEVE THAT WE STILL HAVE SEXISM. FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE SO MANY WOMEN, BUT ALSO WE -- [ APPLAUSE ] BUT IT'S WHERE WE ALL COME FROM. I DON'T KNOW -- WHEN DO WE BEGIN TO BE SEXIST. ARE WE THERE IN THE WOMB THINKING, THIS IS ALL VERY WELL, BUT I THINK MY DAD WOULD DO A BETTER JOB? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TO EMERGE FROM THIS LIFE GIVING, WARM NURTURING PLACE, AND THEN GO, OKAY, THANK YOU. SET FIRE TO THAT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THESE THINGS ARE SO OBVIOUS, THEY SHOULDN'T NEED TO BE DISCUSSED. HOMOPHOBIA. HOW CAN WE STILL HAVE HOMOPHOBIA WHEN ELTON JOHN WROTE "THE LION KING." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO DO FOR YOU PEOPLE. I IMAGINE HIM SOMETIMES THINKING OF RETIRING, BECAUSE HE MUST BE EXHAUSTED. HE'S DONE SO MUCH AND THEN HIS PEOPLE COME TO HIM AND SAY, "YOU CAN'T, THERE IS STILL INTOLERANCE." AND HE SAYS, "OKAY, BRING ME THE PIANO." BUT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN TOLD EVERYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW, AND THE PEOPLE WILL NOT LISTEN. THE BEATLES, MANY YEARS AGO, TOLD US, ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE. AND THEY COULDN'T HAVE MADE THAT MESSAGE ANY MORE SIMPLE OR CATCHY. ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE, ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE, ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU SAID, "YEAH WE SHOULD HAVE A MORTGAGE." [ LAUGHTER ] SOMETIMES I ENJOY THESE BITS MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE. BUT ALL WE DO IS SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM EACH OTHER. AND IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE ALL EGO MANIACS WHO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. THERE ARE ABOUT 300 PEOPLE IN HERE RIGHT NOW, AND EACH ONE OF YOU THINKS THAT YOU'RE THE IMPORTANT ONE. EVEN THOUGH ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS TOWARD THE FACT THAT IT'S DEFINITELY ME. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: SIMON AMSTELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. CHECK OUT HIS SHOW "TO BE FREE" OUT ON TOUR THIS YEAR ALL OVER THE U.S. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
