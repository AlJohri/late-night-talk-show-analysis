[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE A A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. THE BETTER NEWS IS YOU'RE ALL SPENDING THE NIGHT HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ AND THAT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. THAT'S AWESOME. IF I FALL ASLEEP FIRST, DON'T PUT MY HAND IN WARM WATER. JUST LET ME -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NO MORE FREEZING MY BRA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY THE SNOWSTORM IS HITTING THE ENTIRE NORTHEAST. IN FACT, BOSTON PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'LL BE CLOSED TOMORROW. YEAH. KIDS IN BOSTON ARE LIKE, "ARE YOU KIDDING? WE HAVEN'T BEEN IN SCHOOL SINCE THE PATRIOTS WON THE SUPER BOWL. [ LAUGHTER ] THINK I'M GOING TOMORROW? NO WAY, DUDE!" LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. I SAW THAT THIS MORNING PRESIDENT TRUMP ACTUALLY WENT ON TWITTER TO CRITICIZE NORDSTROM FOR DROPPING HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA'S LINE AND TREATING HER UNFAIRLY. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WHILE TRUMP'S TWEETING ABOUT A A DEPARTMENT STORE, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHAT THE RETURN POLICY IS FOR PRESIDENTS. AND THEY GO --
Steve: HEY OH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I'LL HOLD. I'LL HOLD. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY TRUMP'S UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. AND I GUESS NOW -- THIS IS REAL. HE IS COMPLAINING THAT THE HAND TOWELS ON AIR FORCE ONE ARE NOT SOFT ENOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SAID, "SIR, THAT'S MY SKIRT." AND HE GOES --
Steve: WHOA! ♪♪ TRUMP.
Jimmy: "STILL -- STILL NOT SOFT ENOUGH." [ LAUGHTER ] YESTERDAY BETSY DeVOS WAS OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED AS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECRETARY OF EDUCATION. NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT THIS, SAYING DeVOS DOESN'T HAVE ANY PUBLIC EDUCATION EXPERIENCE AND IS CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE UNFIT FOR THE JOB. I DON'T KNOW, I GOT TO SAY, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE NEW STANDARDIZED TEST QUESTIONS THAT SHE'S COME UP WITH, THEY MIGHT HAVE A POINT. YEAH. WE GOT AN EARLY COPY.
Steve: ARE YOU SERIOUS? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
Steve: WOW. HOW'D WE GET THAT?
Jimmy: WELL, LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THE FIRST QUESTION IS, "WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING -- A, BERT. B, ERNIE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT DOESN'T --

Jimmy: THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. WHICH OF THE -- I MEAN, I GOT TO GO WITH ERNIE.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW --
Steve: I MEAN BUT, STILL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR QUESTION --
Jimmy: THE NEXT QUESTION SAYS, "FILL IN THE BLANK." IT'S JUST A BLANK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: THAT'S IT. THAT'S ALL -- YOU FILL IN THE BLANK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: THAT SOUNDS LIKE --
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, "WHAT DOES THE EDUCATION SECRETARY DO? DETAILED ANSWERS WELCOME." I MEAN -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT, THAT WORRIES ME A LITTLE BIT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT DOES WORRY --
Jimmy: YEAH.
Steve: JUST A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: I SEE THAT, I'M LIKE, "NO WAY, DUDE!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE ANOTHER BIG STORY IS TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN. EARLIER TODAY HE DEFENDED THE BAN BY SAYING, QUOTE, "EVEN A A BAD HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WOULD SUPPORT IT." AND BETSY DeVOS SAID, "AND THANKS TO ME, WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF THOSE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. ERNIE. WHO IS ERNIE? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OOH, SORRY. WE WERE LOOKING FOR "WHO IS BURT?"
Steve: OOH. LOOKING FOR "WHAT IS ERNIE?"
Jimmy: ACCORDING TO A WHITE HOUSE AIDE, PRESIDENT TRUMP LOVES TO DRINK VIRGIN BLOODY MARYS. KIND OF AN ODD COCKTAIL, TO DRINK. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT -- NOT VERY POPULAR. WELL, IT TURNS OUT TRUMP ALSO LOVES SOME OTHER LESSER-KNOWN COCKTAILS. WE GOT A LIST EARLY, HERE.

Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
I WAS GREAT AT IT --.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, OF COURSE. YEAH, THOSE GUYS.
EARLY ON WE DID A SKETCH WHERE TWO OF MY WRITERS, WHO ARE -- MY BELOVED WRITERS, I SHOULD SAY. SETH REESE AND CONNOR O'MALLEY. THEY DID A SKETCH WHERE THEY PLAYED -- IT WAS TOP HAT AND OVERALLS. AND TOP HAT WAS VERY RICH AND OVERALLS WAS VERY POOR.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD.
BUT DESPITE THIS, THEY WE WERE VERY GOOD FRIENDS. AND -- THE AUDIENCE WAS JUST MAKING THIS NOISE THE WHOLE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT -- NEVER MADE THAT ONE.
Jimmy: I LOVE TOP HAT AND OVERALLS.
THAT NOISE.
Jimmy: THAT NOISE, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAD A SKETCH. IT WAS AN ALIEN COUPLE. AND -- WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE A RECURRING -- WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON COSTUMES. IT WAS JUST AN ARGUING COUPLE, LIKE, A HUSBAND AND WIFE, JUST YELLING LIKE DUMB ARGUMENTS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND IT GOT THAT REACTION.
THE ONE DAY I SAY -- OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS WE MADE A STAFF GIFT AND WE MADE TOP HAT AND OVERALL ORNAMENTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE HAD SO MANY BAD BITS, THAT WE COULDN'T GIVE ENOUGH GIFTS OUT. BUT IT IS FUNNY BECAUSE -- THE FUNNY THING ABOUT DOING THESE SHOWS IS HOW QUICKLY YOU CAN TELL SOMETHING'S NOT WORKING.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE AT "SNL" SOMETIMES YOU DO A SKETCH AND THINK "THIS IS GOING TO TURN AROUND." AND NOW WHEN SOMETHING'S GOING BAD YOU'RE LIKE, "NOPE."
Jimmy: NO.
YOU WANT TO SAY TO THE AUDIENCE, "THERE'S SIX MORE MINUTES." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, LIKE, IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BE DONE. ABSOLUTELY.
I APOLOGIZE. YEAH.
Jimmy: I THINK YOU'RE REALLY HITTING YOUR STRIDE. YOUR INTERVIEW WITH KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS FANTASTIC.
OH, THANKS. YEAH.
Jimmy: WHICH IS -- THAT COULD BE TRICKY. I MEAN --
YEAH. I MEAN, I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE FACT SHE CAME ON THE SHOW. AND SHE -- I THINK IT IS SAFE TO SAY SHE IS AS GOOD AS WHAT SHE SETS OUT TO DO WITH ANYONE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT IT WAS REALLY FUN TO TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO I HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENT WITH, SOME ISSUES. BUT TO DO IT IN A RESPECTFUL WAY, BOTH FROM HER TO ME AND VICE VERSA. AND HOPEFULLY SHE'LL COME BACK AGAIN.
Jimmy: YEAH, I THOUGHT YOU HANDLED IT SO PERFECTLY. AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SOME TYPE OF THING WITH TRUMP. I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT STARTED.
YEAH. TRUMP AND I -- [ LAUGHTER ] HE DOESN'T LOVE ME. WE -- WELL, I, YOU KNOW -- I THINK WHEN IT STARTED BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE HAD HOSTED "SNL." WE WORKED WITH HIM THEN BACK IN '04.
Jimmy: WE DID A SKETCH TOGETHER.
WE DID A SKETCH WITH HIM. YEAH. AND --
Jimmy: WE DID.
AND THEN IN --
Jimmy: HE WAS YOUR DAD?
HE WAS MY DAD. YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT.
HE WAS MY DAD AND HORACIO WAS YOUR DAD.
Jimmy: MY DAD, YEAH. WE'RE THE SAME AGE, YEAH.
AND IT IS FUNNY BECAUSE IN THAT SKETCH YOU AND HORACIO GOT ALONG AND ME AND TRUMP EVEN AS FATHER AND SON DIDN'T GET ALONG. SO THERE WAS -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT HE -- IN 2011 I HOSTED THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER AND HE WAS IN THE AUDIENCE.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. AND I TOLD A LOT OF JOKES ABOUT HIM. SO DID PRESIDENT OBAMA. BUT IT WAS VERY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THE C-SPAN CAMERAS KEPT CUTTING TO HIM VERY STONE-FACED. HE WAS NOT ENJOYING IT.
Jimmy: HE DOESN'T ENJOY GETTING ANY --
NO.
Jimmy: CRITICISM OR --
HE'S NOT -- HE'S NOT A GUY WHO LOVES A GOOD ZINGER AT HIS EXPENSE. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: REALLY?
BECAUSE I KNOW AFTER THAT HAPPENED, YOU TOOK SOME HEAT.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH.
AND SOME PEOPLE SAID YOU ARE THE REASON HE WON.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I'M SO INSULTED BY THAT BECAUSE I AM THE REASON HE WON.
Jimmy: WHAT?
I MADE FUN OF HIM IN 2011. THAT'S THE NIGHT HE DECIDED TO RUN. [ LAUGHTER ] I KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU RUBBED A HORNET'S HEAD. THAT'S NOT BOTH BAD.
Jimmy: YOU KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST.
I DID. AND, YOU KNOW -- AND NOW EVERYBODY'S LIKE -- I JUST WANT --
Jimmy: YEAH.
LOOK, AGAIN, IT IS NOT THE OUTCOME I WANTED BUT THAT'S HISTORY.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU JUST WANT SOME RESPECT.
I GOT A MAN ELECTED PRESIDENT. I WANT MY POINTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I UNDERSTAND. I GOT YOU. TELL ME ABOUT THIS WEEKEND. YOU ARE RECEIVING THIS AWARD.
YEAH, YOU KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE LIKE THIS BUT -- THE VERY FEW TIMES IN MY LIFE WHERE ANYONE HAS OFFERED TO HONOR ME I JUST FEEL LIKE IT WAS JUST A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. IS THERE, LIKE -- IS THIS A A MISCALCULATION. BUT IT IS VERY KIND, IT IS AN INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION. BUT THEY'RE HONORING THE FILM "MOONLIGHT" WHICH IS INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: SURE.
THEY'RE HONORING MERYL STREEP THE SAME NIGHT. AND THE NIGHT'S ABOUT EQUALITY. AND I FEEL LIKE IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM AM I THE EQUAL OF THE OTHER PEOPLE --
