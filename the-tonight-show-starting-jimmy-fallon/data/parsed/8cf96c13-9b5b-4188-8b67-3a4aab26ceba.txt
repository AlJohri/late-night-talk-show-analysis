PATRICK'S DAY TO EVERYONE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND EVERYONE AT HOME, WATCHING, TOO. FOR MANY TODAY, A PROUD DAY TO CELEBRATE IRISH HERITAGE. FOR MOST, IT'S THE START OF PRE-GAMING FOR CINCO DE MAYO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO, IT'S A LITTLE -- LITTLE PRIMER. GET THIS. I READ THAT 13 MILLION PINTS OF GUINNESS WERE EXPECTED TO BE CONSUMED TODAY. YEAH. AND THEY JUST DIDN'T EXPECT THAT WE'D DO IT BY 9:00 A.M., BUT WE DID. [ CHEERS ] WE'RE OVERACHIEVERS.
Steve: WE DID IT!
Jimmy: USA! USA! USA! [ AUDIENCE CHANTING USA ] THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH. THERE WAS A LOT OF DRINKING TODAY. SO, FOR ONCE, IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL WHEN SEAN SPICER SHOWED UP TO HIS WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING WITH A FLASK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, THAT'S NORMAL. ACTUALLY, IT TURNS OUT, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A BIG FAN OF THE IRISH. THAT'S WHY YESTERDAY HE SPORTED THE COLORS OF THEIR FLAG. THERE YOU GO. HE'S GOT GREEN TIE, WHITE SHIRT, ORANGE CHIN. [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S PERFECT.
Steve: OH!
Jimmy: THE WHOLE COMBO. THAT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL.
Steve: YEAH, VERY THOUGHTFUL OF HIM.
Jimmy: BUT IT TURNS OUT EVERYONE IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LOVES ST. PATRICK'S DAY, AND SEVERAL MEMBERS TOOK PART IN THE FESTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS DRESSED UP AS THE LUCKY CHARMS LEPRECHAUN AND NOBODY NOTICED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO ONE.

WHEN ASKED IF HE'D APOLOGIZE TO OBAMA, TRUMP SAID, "I'LL JUST SAY I'M SORRY THE NEXT TIME HE WIRETAPS ME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO. THE WHITE HOUSE DID APOLOGIZE FOR ACCUSING BRITISH INTELLIGENCE OF HELPING OBAMA WIRETAP TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN. AND TO SHOW THAT THERE'S NO HARD FEELINGS, THE UK PROMISED TO NEVER LISTEN TO ANYTHING TRUMP SAYS EVER AGAIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. LET'S SHAKE ON THAT. WE HAVE A DEAL. WE'LL NEVER, EVER DO IT. MEANWHILE, TRUMP HELD A JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL TODAY. WE WATCHED IT, AND IT SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS A LITTLE DISTRACTED. LOOK AT -- CAN WE SEE WHAT SHE IS THINKING ABOUT HERE?
