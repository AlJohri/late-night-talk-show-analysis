Jimmy: HEY OLD MAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, NO! NO! OH! YEAH! SCOREBOARD! YEAH! HA!
Jimmy: AH! [ CHEERS ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HUGH JACKMAN RIGHT THERE! "X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST" IS IN THEATERS FRIDAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JIMMY PAGE. ♪♪
Jimmy: WE'RE JOINED RIGHT NOW BY A ROCK N' ROLL ICON AND LEGENDARY STUDIO PRODUCER. HE FOUNDED A BAND CALLED LED ZEPPELIN AND HAS SPENT THE PAST -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] -- FEW YEARS REMASTERING THEIR ENTIRE CATALOG. THE FIRST REISSUES, LED ZEPPELIN ONE, TWO, AND THREE WILL BE RELEASED ON JUNE 3RD. PLEASE WELCOME TO OUR SHOW, JIMMY PAGE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WHOO! JIMMY PAGE, WELCOME TO THE SHOW! COME ON!
YES, IT'S A PLEASURE.
Jimmy: YOU'RE THE COOLEST JIMMY NOW ON "LATE NIGHT", OFFICIALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, BUDDY. YOU WERE TELLING ME BACKSTAGE THAT YOU GET TO SEE THE SHOW IN ENGLAND.
YES, I -- WE DO GET IT.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WE COULD BE SEEN IN ENGLAND.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS FANTASTIC FOR ME.
LATE NIGHT. LATE NIGHT.
Jimmy: IT'S VERY -- ABSOLUTELY. YEAH. I WILL -- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
YES. IT'S PROBABLY A DAY OR SO BEHIND, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH. SO YOU WON'T SEE YOU FOR A A COUPLE DAYS. BY THE WAY, MY FIRST LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM I GOT, I FOUND IN THE WOODS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I THINK -- I THINK THAT'S HOW A LOT OF KIDS, WHEN I GREW UP, DELIVERED LED ZEPPELIN ALBUMS. LIKE A LITTLE FAIRY OR SOMETHING WOULD COME AND APPEAR AND GO, "AHH. THERE'S YOUR LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM." YOU FOUND IT AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ANYONE. BUT THIS GUY, I MEAN THIS IS JUST -- LOOK AT THIS. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE FIRST ONE. IT'S ALL REMASTERED ON THIS THING. YOU'VE TAKEN ON THE GIANT, GIANT TASK OF REMASTERING ALL OF THIS THING. FIRST OF ALL, WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS? THIS IS A BIG JOB.
WELL, IT'S, IT'S -- YEAH, I KNOW IT IS, BUT WHAT IT, WHAT IT ENTAILS, IT'S -- IT WAS REMASTERING THE CATALOG. WHEN THESE THINGS WERE ORIGINALLY DONE, THEY WERE DONE FOR VINYL. AND THEN, THEY WERE REMASTERED ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO FOR CD MARKET. BUT NOW, THERE'S A RE-EMERGING VINYL MARKET, CDs, THERE'S --
Jimmy: YEAH.
DIGITAL ONLINE. SO, THE WHOLE LOT OF ALL OF THESE ORIGINAL ALBUMS HAS BEEN REMASTERED FOR ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT MEDIA IF YOU LIKE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THOUGHT, "WELL, OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE THIS. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE REMASTERED THEIR CATALOG, SO LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT, LIKE, REALLY SPECIAL.
Jimmy: SO, THEN YOU DECIDED TO TAKE THIS THING ON. SO ANY VINYL -- FREAKS SHOULD BE PSYCHED UP OR LED ZEPPELIN FREAKS BECAUSE THIS IS THE STUFF THAT YOU FOUND IN THE VAULTS WHICH IS -- WHERE ARE THE VAULTS?
OKAY.
Jimmy: I SAY "THE VAULTS" BUT WHAT -- I DON'T KNOW -- WAS IT UNDER THE OCEAN SOMEWHERE? [ LAUGHS ]
UNDER --
Jimmy: WHAT DO I HAVE TO TAKE, A SUBMARINE TO GET THE LED ZEPPELIN VAULTS?
WELL, YOU ALMOST NEED -- YOU NEED TO TIME TRAVEL TO GET BACK INTO THERE.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S UNDER ONE OF THE PYRAMIDS. THAT'S WHERE THEY HAVE THEM ALL.
YEAH, WHAT IT WAS -- YOU KNOW, I WAS A PRODUCER OF THE BAND, SO I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE STUDIO MORE TIMES THAN THE REST OF THE GUYS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I USED TO TAKE BACK REFERENCE MIXES AND -- THAT'S IT. YOU KNOW? IT STARTED TO BUILD UP AND I -- I TOOK GOOD CARE OF ALL THIS STUFF AND --
Jimmy: YOU ACTUALLY --
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK WELL TO HAVE A COMPANION DISC THAT REFLECTED WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE DISCS THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS SO THAT IT GIVES YOU, LIKE, A LITTLE WINDOW INTO IT. A LITTLE DOORWAY SO YOU GET, LIKE, AN EXTRA DIMENSION OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THOSE TIMES.
Jimmy: I GOT TO SAY IT'S PRETTY WILD AND IT'S REALLY IN DEPTH, AND YOU ACTUALLY WENT TO SOME CRAZY LED ZEPPELIN FANS. YOU FOUND THEM, LIKE, ONLINE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND YOU SAID TO THEM, "HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THESE TRACKS" OR AM I JUST -- I MEAN, ARE THESE BEEN RELEASED OR AM I MAKING THIS UP? I DON'T THINK THIS HAS BEEN RELEASED.
WELL, IT WAS MORE A A QUESTION, I'LL BE REALLY HONEST WITH YOU HERE. IT WAS A QUESTION IF SOME OF THAT STUFF HAD COME OUT ACROSS THE YEARS. NOT WHAT I HAD AT HOME BUT -- CERTAIN MATERIAL FROM THE STUDIO HAD LEAKED OUT. COME OUT ON BOOTLEG. SO, WHEN I STARTED TO LISTEN TO ALL OF THIS ANALOG TAPE, AND COMES AS -- TO DO THIS, I JUST REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MATERIAL THAT I HAD HADN'T COME OUT ON BOOTLEG.
Jimmy: RIGHT, AND --
SO --
Jimmy: IT HADN'T.
I HAD TO CHECK WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE KNOW, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT HADN'T.
Jimmy: WELL, I'M SO EXCITED. IT'S ABOUT TO COME OUT. IS IT JUNE 3RD? YOU GUYS, LED ZEPPELIN FANS, GET READY FOR THIS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FIRST THREE -- REISSUES ARE OUT JUNE 3RD. OH, MY GOD. JIMMY PAGE RIGHT THERE! YOU'RE, LIKE, THE COOLEST EVER. COME BACK WHENEVER YOU WANT TO.
