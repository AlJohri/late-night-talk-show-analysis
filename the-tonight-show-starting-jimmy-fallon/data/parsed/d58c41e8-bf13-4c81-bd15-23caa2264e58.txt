THANK YOU. THANK YOU, I WORKED REALLY HARD ON IT AND I'VE LIKE, COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO THE ROLE. AND I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE WHILE I'M DOING "HORROR STORY." I'M DOING THE ENTIRE SEASON. I REALLY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. I WENT TO ACTING SCHOOL FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS GROWING UP IN NEW YORK. I GREW UP HERE. I WENT TO STRASBURG THEATER DOWNTOWN. I STUDIED METHOD ACTING AND I JUST WAS REALLY TERRIBLE AT AUDITIONING AND EXTREMELY AWKWARD AND COULDN'T GET A JOB, SO I DECIDED TO BECOME A SINGER INSTEAD.
Jimmy: REALLY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK GOODNESS YOU DID. WILL YOU EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS NEW SEASON OF "AMERICAN HORROR STORY: HOTEL"?
WELL, WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS SEASON OF "HOTEL" IS THAT THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING EXPLORATION OF THEMES OF ADDICTION AND THEMES OF SURVIVAL. AND HOW WE AS PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, NOWADAYS, YOU KNOW, WE'VE KIND OF ISOLATED OURSELVES FROM ONE ANOTHER. WE DON'T COMMUNICATE THE SAME WAY. THERE'S NOT AS MUCH KIND OF HUMAN INTERACTION AND CONNECTION. WE'RE ALL ON OUR CELL PHONES. WE'RE ALL ON THE INTERNET, WE'RE ALL E-MAILING ONE ANOTHER. AND SO, AS A RESULT, THERE'S THIS REALLY KIND OF STRANGE WORLD THAT RYAN HAS CREATED OF THESE VERY NARCISSISTIC CHARACTERS THAT ARE ALL TRYING TO SURVIVE IN THEIR OWN WAY. MINE IN PARTICULARLY IS A A HEMOPHILIAC, OR A VAMPIRE, SO I NEED TO DRINK BLOOD IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. YOU FIND YOURSELF GOING WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG AND WHAT IS GOOD, AND WHAT IS EVIL AND WHEN IS IT OKAY --
Jimmy: TO DRINK BLOOD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WELL, WHEN IT IS IT OKAY TO BE CUNNING IN ORDER TO SURVIVE AND IN ORDER TO KEEP YOUR HAPPINESS? AND THAT'S WHAT IT REALLY, SO YOU'RE WONDERING WHY YOU LIKE SOME OF THESE CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO, YOU KNOW --

KIND OF MANIACAL, BUT IT'S GREAT. I'M ENJOYING IT SO MUCH. I FEEL SO ALIVE, I CAN'T TELL YOU. I CAN'T THANK RYAN MURPHY AND THE CAST ENOUGH. THEY'RE SO, SO TALENTED AND SO AVAILABLE TO ME. AND I JUST FEEL EVERY DAY LIKE I HAVE THESE COMPLETELY DEEP, YOU KNOW, HUMAN EXPERIENCES THAT I DON'T GET, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FAMOUS, YOU DON'T GET TO ALWAYS WITH PEOPLE WHEN YOU MEET THEM, HAVE A REALLY --
Jimmy: CONNECTION.
A STRONG EXCHANGE. WITH THESE ACTORS, THEY'RE RIGHT THERE FOR ME, READY TO GO.

Jimmy: YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK TO THE SHOW. YOU LOOK GREAT. AND I WANT TO BRING SOMETHING UP. LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, YOU WERE LEAVING OUR SHOW AND THE PAPARAZZIS GOT SOME PICTURES OF YOU LEAVING.
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: YEAH, A LITTLE BIT. BUT HERE'S THE PICTURE HERE. IS THAT A BAG OF FRUIT THAT YOU TOOK FROM US?
YEAH.
Jimmy: IS THAT OUR FRUIT FROM THE GREEN ROOM?
THAT IS YOUR FRUIT FROM THE GREEN ROOM. AND, YOU KNOW WHAT, I WAS PRETTY CONFIDENT ABOUT TAKING IT UNLESS THERE WAS LIKE A A MIXED FRUIT NINJA VIGILANTE COMING AFTER ME. I THOUGHT I WAS PRETTY, I COULD TAKE THEM.
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T GET AWAY WITH THAT, AND WE WANT THAT FRUIT BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THAT'S OUR PROPERTY.
MY EYES ARE ON THE MIXED VEGETABLES THIS TIME. YOU CAN'T STOP ME.
Jimmy: CONGRATS. YOU WON TWO ESPY AWARDS. YOU WON FOR BEST FEMALE ATHLETE, AND YOU WON FOR BEST FIGHTER. CONGRATULATIONS. THAT'S GIGANTIC, THAT'S HUGE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND YOU BEAT OUT FLOYD MAYWEATHER, AND YOU HAD SOME CHOICE WORDS FOR FLOYD AFTERWARDS THAT I'M SURE YOU HEARD THAT YOUR QUOTES GOT HEARD. WHAT DID YOU SAY AGAIN TO FLOYD MAYWEATHER?
I SAID --
Jimmy: SOMETHING.
SOMETHING TO THE FACT THAT NOW HE KNOWS HOW IT FEELS TO HAVE A WOMAN BEAT HIM FOR ONCE.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HAVE YOU HEARD FROM FLOYD SINCE? HAS HE CONTACTED YOU AT ALL?
NO, I HAVEN'T GOT ANY LIKE TEXTS OR CALLS, NOTHING LIKE THAT. HE STILL MAINTAINS HE HAS NO CLUE WHO I AM. SO, IF I EVER RUN INTO HIM, EVERY TIME I RUN INTO HIM, I'M GOING TO REINTRODUCE MYSELF EVERY TIME, AND MAYBE ONE DAY HE'LL ACTUALLY REMEMBER ME.
Jimmy: YEAH, I THINK HE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE. [ LAUGHTER ] STILL UNDEFEATED. GOSH, THE LAST FIGHT, EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THAT. YOU WERE IN BRAZIL.
YES.
Jimmy: IT WAS BETHE --
CORREIA.
Jimmy: CORREIA. AND YOU SAID, CO-SEE YA. [ LAUGHTER ] 34 SECONDS OR SOMETHING?
I TOOK MY TIME. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. OH, MY GOSH.
IT WAS LONGER THAN THE LAST TWO COMBINED. I COULD HAVE FINISHED IT EARLIER BECAUSE SHE WENT TO THE GROUND. I DIDN'T GO TO THE GROUND. SHE WOULD LIKE, TRY TO CLOSE THE DISTANCE, THAT I COULD HAVE THROWN HER. I'M LIKE, NO, YOU'RE GETTING KNOCKED OUT TONIGHT. AND SO, IT WENT 34 SECONDS.
Jimmy: MAN, OH, MAN, OH MAN, OH MAN. WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW. DO YOU, I MEAN, YOU HAVE ANY, WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE FIGHT? THE FIGHT ENDS. YOU JUST KNOCKED SOMEBODY OUT. YOU HAVE YOUR GAME FACE ON. THEN THE FIGHT'S OVER WITH. YOU'RE OUT OF THE RING IN YOUR HOTEL. WHAT DO YOU DO? WHAT'S IT LIKE?
MY FIRST MOMENT ALONE IS ACTUALLY WHEN I FINALLY GET TO TAKE A SHOWER. AND IT'S LIKE, IT'S STILL OVER SIMULATING BECAUSE THERE'S A A PRESS CONFERENCE AND DRUG TESTING AND PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING. AAHH. AND THEN LIKE, IT'S THE ONE MOMENT YOU HAVE ALONE. AND SOMETIMES I GET WASHED OVER WITH SO MUCH LIKE RELIEF AND JOY. I START LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY IN THE SHOWER. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE BY MYSELF. IT'S SUCH A HAPPY MOMENT, YOU KNOW. AND THEN WHEN I FINALLY --
Jimmy: THAT'S --
YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S KIND OF WEIRD.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, A LITTLE, YEAH. IF ANYONE WALKS BY, THEY'RE LIKE, WHAT'S SHE DOING IN THERE? IS THAT A REMOVABLE SHOWER HEAD? LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WOULDN'T, REALLY? THAT'S INTERESTING. AND THEN, BUT DON'T YOU EAT HOT WINGS, LAST TIME YOU WERE SAYING.
YEAH, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME. ONCE I HAD A FIGHT WHERE LIKE, THE FIRST TIME I DEFENDED MY BELT AGAINST SARAH KAUFMAN, I CAME BACK TO MY ROOM. THEY ROLLED IN THIS TABLE WITH ALL THE ROOM SERVICE THINGS WITH LITTLE LIKE, METAL DISKS OVER IT, AND IT SMELLS LIKE WINGS. THEY OPENED IT UP AND THEY WERE BREADED AND BONELESS. I CRIED. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT LYING. I REALLY CRIED.
Jimmy: BUT YOU TRAIN, YOU TRAIN SO MUCH. SO WHEN YOU GET TO SPLURGE, YOU LOVE HOT WINGS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: DO YOU HAVE A PLACE IN NEW YORK THAT YOU GET HOT WINGS FROM?
YOU KNOW WHAT. MMA IS ILLEGAL HERE STILL, SO IT STILL HASN'T -- I DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN AND GO OUT FOR WINGS IN NEW YORK. SO WRITE YOUR CONGRESSMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] TELL THEM TO DO SOMETHING. BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT HERE. WHERE WOULD YOU GO?
Jimmy: I ACTUALLY GOT YOU SOME WINGS.
YOU DID?
Jimmy: FROM THIS PLACE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ONLY ENOUGH, ONLY ENOUGH FOR US.
WOW.
Jimmy: HAVE YOU HEARD OF CHO CHEUNG?
NO.
Jimmy: CHO CHEUNG WINGS? THEY FRY THEM TWICE. YEAH, SO NICE, THEY FRY THEM TWICE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S EXTRA SUPER CRISPY AND SUPER DUPER SPICY.
REALLY?
Jimmy: DO YOU WANT ONE? DO YOU CARE FOR ONE?
I'M IN TRAINING CAMP RIGHT NOW. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] DUDE, THE WINGS ARE AMAZING BECAUSE I ABSTAIN AND I EARN THEM. SOME PEOPLE HAVE WINGS EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIFE.
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HIT ME OR ANYTHING? I DIDN'T DO THIS ON PURPOSE.
NO. I'LL PASS THIS AROUND TO THE AUDIENCE. [ CHEERS ] YOU WANT SOME WINGS? PASS THEM UP. PASS THEM BEHIND YOU. THERE MIGHT BE PEANUTS IN HERE. IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES, DON'T EAT THEM. THERE MIGHT BE PEANUTS IN HERE. IF YOUR HANDS GET STICKY, THIS GUY HERE WILL LICK EVERYONE'S FINGERS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S PERFECT. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN TRAINING, WAS MAKING SURE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SORRY TO TORTURE YOU LIKE THAT.
ARE YOU ON THE PAYROLL OF HOLLY HOLM, OR SOMETHING? ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME MISS WEIGHT?
Jimmy: NO, I'M SO SORRY. I FORGOT THAT YOU'RE IN TRAINING. OF COURSE, YOU'RE FIGHTING NOVEMBER. OF COURSE, YOU CAN'T EAT WINGS. I APOLOGIZE. DID NOT DO THAT ON PURPOSE. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR OPPONENT, HERE. THIS IS YOUR OPPONENT HERE, HOLLY HOLM. SEEMS LIKE A NICE PERSON.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S A NICE CHICK. YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: SHE'S NICE.
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST HER. SHE'S JUST A NICE CHICK THAT'S GOING TO LOSE.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. GOING TO LOSE. DO YOU PICK THE TIME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WIN IN THIS ONE, NO?
THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE A A MUCH LONGER FIGHT BECAUSE SHE'S A 19-TIME BOXING WORLD CHAMPION WITH 100% TAKE DOWN DEFENSE AND LIKE, HEAD KICK KNOCKOUT. SO I MEAN, SHE'S UNDEFEATED AND AMAZING ATHLETE. THE BIGGEST THREAT DEFINITELY TO ME, ESPECIALLY ON PAPER AND STYLISTICALLY. SHE'S THE TYPE OF FIGHTER YOU HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY PATIENT WITH. I FEEL LIKE, SHE'S GOING TO TRY AND LIKE, KEEP DISTANCE AND KEEP FAR AWAY FROM ME AND GET ME FRUSTRATED TO THE POINT I'LL MAKE A MISTAKE AND SHE CAN TRY AND KICK ME IN THE HEAD, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO GO LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT THE WAY THAT SHE WANTS.
Jimmy: SEE HOW YOU'RE CHANGING RIGHT NOW?
YEAH.
Jimmy: I'M GETTING DEEP INTO YOUR HEAD. 'CAUSE YOU'RE HAPPY, AND LOOK AT HOW CUTE. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN YOUR GAME FACE COMES ON. YOU HAVE A GAME FACE? WHEN YOU GO IN THE RING, HOW DO YOU LOOK AT SOMEBODY? SAY WE'RE FIGHTING. BUT JUST SAY WE'RE FIGHTING, PRETEND. [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, MY GODFATHER WAS TRYING TO GIVE ME TIPS ON HOW TO HAVE A A GAME FACE. AND HE WAS LIKE, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM THROUGH YOUR EYEBROWS. SO HE WAS LIKE, YOU PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN AND YOU LOOK UP THROUGH YOUR EYEBROWS AT THEM, AND LOOK MEAN AS YOU CAN. I'M LIKE 11 YEARS OLD AND LIKE, OKAY, I'M GONNA LOOK MEAN. AND SO LIKE, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.
YEAH. BUT BEFORE, THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO. NOW, I KIND OF THINK THINGS AT THEM. AND IT SHOWS IN MY EYES. SO, I DON'T REALLY PURPOSELY TRY TO POSE MY FACE. I THINK ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO TO THEM, AND IT JUST SHOWS.
Jimmy: DON'T THINK. YOU THINK NICE THOUGHTS WHEN YOU SEE ME THOUGH, RIGHT?
YES, ALWAYS.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE.
EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO MARIO KART.
Jimmy: LAST TIME YOU CAME, WE PLAYED MARIO KART BACKSTAGE. MAN, OH, MAN, I MOPPED THE FLOOR WITH YOU.
I NEVER PLAYED THAT VERSION OF MARIO KART EVER BEFORE. WHEN I LEFT, I WAS SO UPSET, I WENT AND BOUGHT A WII, I WENT AND BOUGHT THAT EXACT KIND OF MARIO KART. I'M LIKE, I'M GOING TO MARIO KART CAMP. I'M GOING TO BE READY. WHEN WE GOT HERE, I WAS LIKE, OH MY GOD, I HAVE BEEN SO BUSY WITH THE FIGHTS AND EVERYTHING. LIKE, I HAVEN'T PREPARED.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THEN I HEARD THAT, YOU KNOW, YOUR FINGER ALMOST FELL OFF. I WAS LIKE, OH, THANK GOD. [ LAUGHTER ] SO NOW --
Jimmy: THANK GOD?
YEAH, SO NOW YOU'RE GONNA BE OUT OF PRACTICE AND I'M GOING TO BE TRAINING. AND BY THE TIME, IT'S NOT WORKING.
Jimmy: OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
