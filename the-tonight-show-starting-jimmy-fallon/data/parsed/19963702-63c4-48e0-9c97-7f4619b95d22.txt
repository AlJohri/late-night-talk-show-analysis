WHERE EVERYONE'S HERE. READY TO PARTY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. OH, MAN. A HOT SHOW TONIGHT. FIRST, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT.
I LOVE YOU JIMMY!
Jimmy: I LOVE YOU, TOO, MOM. I LOVE YOU TOO MOM. THANK YOU FOR COMING. WE WENT OVER THE RULES. [ LAUGHTER ]
I LOVE YOU!
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. THAT'S MY DAD. HE HAS A HIGH VOICE. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: HE HAS A HIGH VOICE. HE'S A JUNKIE.
Steve: OH REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH, HE'S A SMALL MAN, YEAH.
Steve: SMALL JOCKEY?
Jimmy: YEAH, HE MODELS FOR JOCKEY AND WEARS SMALL JOCKEY --
Steve: WEARS TWO SMALL JOCKEYS.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. YEAH. BIG TECH NEWS, YOU GUYS. APPLE ANNOUNCED THE iPHONE 6 TODAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOT NEWS. WHICH THEY SAY HAS A MORE DURABLE SCREEN THAT WON'T CRACK OR SCRATCH EASILY. OR AS YOUR KIDS PUT IT, "CHALLENGE ACCEPTED." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. APPLE PROMISED LESS CRACKING, AND ROB FORD SAID, "HEY, THAT'S MY CAMPAIGN SLOGAN." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHY IS IT NOT NO CRACKING? YEAH.
Steve: WHAT'S HIS LAUGH? HE DOES --
Jimmy: HE LOVES CRACKING I STILL CRACKED A LITTLE BIT. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? OF COURSE, NOW, EVERYONE HAS TO GO THROUGH THE FOUR STAGES OF BUYING A NEW iPHONE. I'VE DONE IT. THE FIRST STAGE IS, "I DON'T NEED A NEW PHONE." FOLLOWED BY, "MAYBE I'LL JUST CHECK IT OUT AT THE STORE." FOLLOWED BY, "MAYBE IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY CURRENT PHONE." FOLLOWED BY, "OH, NO, IT FELL IN THE TOILET, I GOTTA GET A A NEW PHONE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I HAVE TO. I NEED IT FOR WORK." DID YOU SEE THIS, AMAZON HAS CUT THE PRICE OF ITS FIRE SMARTPHONES TO JUST 99 CENTS TO COMPETE WITH THE NEW iPHONE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHEN THEY HEARD THAT, EVEN BLACKBERRY WAS LIKE, "AT LEAST GO OUT WITH SOME DIGNITY, MY MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S JUST SAD. JUST SAD." COME ON. [ APPLAUSE ] "I'LL BE YOUR BEST FRIEND." "ALL RIGHT." THE AMAZON FIRE WILL BE MY BEST FRIEND. HE SAID SO. LET'S SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY HAD A CLOSED DOOR MEETING WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS YESTERDAY TO DISCUSS FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES. YEP, HE WANTED TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM AND HAVE A REAL HEART-TO- -- WHATEVER IS IN THERE AT THIS POINT. [ LAUGHTER ] BABOON KIDNEY OR SOMETHING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OHIO CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN IS MAKING NEWS FOR SAYING THAT IF JOHN McCAIN WERE PRESIDENT, WE WOULD CURRENTLY BE IN SEVEN DIFFERENT WARS. AS OPPOSED TO NOW WHEN IT'S ONLY LIKE SIX WARS. [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD POINT, THOUGH. GOOD POINT. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY HIRED A D.C. LAW FIRM CALLED BAKER HOSTETLER TO HELP THEM SUE PRESIDENT OBAMA. YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING SUED. YEAH. WELL, I COULDN'T GET TO SLEEP THE OTHER NIGHT. I WAS UP LATE, I WAS WATCHING A A RERUN OF "AMERICAN NINJA WARRIOR." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I STILL COULDN'T GET TO LEEP. AND I'M WATCHING THAT AND I SEE THIS COMMERCIAL FOR THIS BAKER HOSTETLER LAW FIRM AND THEY REALLY SEEM LIKE THE REAL DEAL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS COMMERCIAL. HI. I'M ATTORNEY WILLIAM HOSTETLER OF BAKER HOSTETLER. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN INJURED BY A A FAULTY AIR BAG? HAVE YOU EVER TRIPPED ON A A CRACK IN THE SIDEWALK? WELL THEN, I'M NOT THE ATTORNEY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. AT BAKER HOSTETLER WE SPECIALIZE IN ONE THING, SUING THE PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU'VE BEEN FORCED TO PASS OBAMACARE EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T LIKE IT, WE CAN HELP YOU WASTE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER MONEY TO FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU SORT OF BELIEVE IN. DID ONE OF YOUR NUDES GET HACKED FROM THE CLOUD? OBAMA MAY BE RESPONSIBLE, HE MIGHT NOT BE. LET'S TAKE HIM TO COURT AND FIND OUT. THINK ULTIMATE FRISBEE SHOULD BE AN OLYMPIC SPORT? EVER WONDER WHY HERMIONE DIDN'T MARRY HARRY INSTEAD OF THE GINGER FREAK? GOT TO BE SOMEBODY'S FAULT. WHY NOT OBAMA? GO BAKER HOSTETLER, AND WE'LL FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHT TO MAKE THE PRESIDENT LIFE A LITTLE MORE ANNOYING.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY SEEMED LIKE THEY GOT IT.
Steve: YEAH.

GET OVER THERE, SIT IN THE NAUGHTY SEAT SIT NEXT TO LAVA LAMP." [ LAUGHTER ]

SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY SPEAKS CHINESE MET WITH HIM AND SAID, "NOPE, HE'S JUST RACIST. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU FOR COMING BY, APPRECIATE IT. YOU OUGHT TO STOP DOING THAT." AND FINALLY, A PRETTY SCARY MOMENT FOR ACTOR MORGAN FREEMAN WHO LANDED SAFELY IN TORONTO OVER THE WEEKEND AFTER THE PLANE THAT HE WAS FLYING SUFFERED A MALFUNCTION. THEY ACTUALLY RELEASED SOME AUDIO FROM THE FLIGHT DECK. IT'S PRETTY COMPELLING. LISTEN TO THIS.

YEAH, HE TURNED ME -- I REALIZED MUCH LATER, IN A VERY SUBTLE WAY, BY KEEPING THE THING AWAY FROM ME, AND JUST DANGLING IT IN FRONT WHERE HE KNEW I COULDN'T REACH IT, AND SAYING, "YOU LIKE THAT, DON'T YOU?" YEAH --
Jimmy: I LIKE IT VERY MUCH, YEAH.
YEAH, YOU KNOW. AND WHEN YOU CAN REACH IT, MAYBE, YOU KNOW, I'LL LET YOU PLAY AROUND WITH IT. ONE DAY I WAS STANDING THERE IN GRAMPA'S PARLOR, A GUITAR IN MY HAND, AND HE SAID, "HOW DID YOU GET THAT?" SEE THOSE CHAIRS, AND THAT BOOK? I MANAGED TO --
Jimmy: -- CLIMB UP AND GRAB IT.
HE SAID, "IF YOU NEED IT THAT MUCH, LET'S START LEARNING A FEW THINGS." SO IT WAS LIKE THAT.

Jimmy: YEAH! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. A LITTLE MUSTARD ON THERE, YEAH, YEAH. A LITTLE CHUCK BERRY. THEN I ALSO HEARD THE STORY, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TRUE OR NOT, DID HE PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE ONCE?
YES, HE DID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE DID? WITH FRIENDS LIKE THAT, YEAH.
I CAN'T GO WRONG.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T GO WRONG. WHY WOULD CHUCK BERRY PUNCH KEITH RICHARDS?
I WAS IN THE DRESSING ROOM, HE WAS DOING A GIG. HE WENT UP TO COLLECT THE MONEY, I THINK.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT IT ALWAYS IS.
HE WAS A TIGHTWAD. BLESS YOU, CHUCK. AND HIS GUITAR WAS LAID OUT IN HIS CASE. AND I THOUGHT, COME ON, KEITH, JUST A TOUCH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY A A LITTLE BIT, RIGHT?
JUST LET ME GET IN AN E CHORD OR SOMETHING. HE WALKED IN AND GOES, "NOBODY TOUCHES MY GUITAR." AND BAM -- THAT'S ONE OF CHUCK'S BIGGEST HITS, BABY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: I DON'T THINK YOU'RE STILL LEARNING. DID YOU EVER FIGURE OUT THE SONG? DID YOU LEARN THAT SONG?
YEAH, YEAH. OH, MAN. ACIDUOUSLY, I INVENTED NEW BITS FOR IT.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY, YOU ADDED NEW BITS ON TOP OF IT? DID YOUR GRANDDAD EVER SEE YOU PLAY IT?
YEAH, YEAH. HE SAID, "NOW ANYTIME YOU COME TO THE HOUSE, THAT GUITAR IS YOURS." BUT HE TEASED ME WITH IT, AND THEN -- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SPOT A GUITAR PLAYER REALLY. BUT SOMEHOW HE WAS A GUY LIKE THAT. AND HE DREW ME INTO THE GUITAR AND INTO PLAYING MUSIC. AND I'M FOREVER GRATEFUL. THAT'S WHY I DID THE BOOK.
Jimmy: DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR FIRST SONG YOU EVER WROTE? AS A KID?
THAT I WROTE?
Jimmy: YEAH.
I WROTE -- THE FIRST SONG I EVER WROTE WAS WITH MICK, "LOCKED IN A KITCHEN."

Jimmy: I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU WERE BORN IN BROOKLYN. [ CHEERS ] WERE YOU RAISED IN BROOKLYN, OR NO?
MY ENTIRE FAMILY WAS BORN IN MAIMONIDES HOSPITAL. MY MOTHER, MY FATHER MY BROTHER, AND MYSELF.
Jimmy: ALL BROOKLYN IN THE HOUSE, YEAH.
OH YEAH. OH YEAH, OH YEAH.
Jimmy: BROOKLYN! HOW COME YOU DON'T HAVE AN ACCENT? A BROOKLYN ACCENT.
BECAUSE I WENT TO GRADUATE SCHOOL AT NYU. AND I HAD TO STUDY HOW TO SPEAK FOR THREE YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH?
AND IT WAS INTENSE.
Jimmy: BUT DOES IT COME OUT IF YOU'VE HAD A FEW COCKTAILS? [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, YEAH. OH YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU GET LIKE, LIKE A NEW YORK ACCENT?
WELL, RHODE ISLAND -- I MOVED TO RHODE ISLAND -- OH, YEAH. [ CHEERS ] EVERYBODY'S HERE.
Jimmy: THAT'S A LOT OF ACCENTS.
THERE YOU GO. LIKE YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: YOU BROUGHT YOUR FAMILY HERE.
THAT'S ALL OF RHODE ISLAND RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] YES. IT WAS LIKE YOU GO TO THE WARWICK MALL.

THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: IT ALL COMES OUT. SO YOU WENT TO NYU.
YES.
Jimmy: TO STUDY ACTING.
YES.
Jimmy: BUT THEN -- I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE KNOW, BUT YOU ALSO WENT TO CIRCUS TRAINING? OR -- [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?
I KNOW THAT IT SOUNDS STRANGE, BUT IN THE VERY FORMAL MASTERS OF FINE ARTS PROGRAM AT NYU, FOR THREE YEARS, WE STUDY CIRCUS WITH HUBBY BURGESS WHO WORKED WITH RINGLING BROTHERS FOR 25 YEARS, AND WE HAD TO DO TIGHT ROPE WALKING, WHICH I SUCKED AT, [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THE TRAPEZE, WHICH I WAS AWESOME AT. AND WE HAD TO LEARN A JUGGLE, WHICH WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A A STRECH FOR ME.
Jimmy: I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THIS COURSE?
GOOD QUESTION. GOO QUESTION. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, IS IT SOMETHING TO FALL BACK ON IT, IF ACTING DIDN'T WORK, YOU COULD BE A CLOWN, I GUESS? [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: WE'RE GONNA PUT IT IN A PUZZLE. HOW DO YOU DO THAT? IT'S THE ONE YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP GOING, RIGHT?
IT REALLY IS.
Jimmy: NO IT'S CONCENTRATION.
I WOULD CALL HOME AND THEY'D SAY, "HOW IS IT GOING?" AND I WOULD BE LIKE, "I CAN'T JUGGLE." AND THEY WOULD BE LIKE, "GREAT. THAT'S WHERE ALL OF OUR MONEY IS GOING, FOR YOU TO LEARN HOW TO JUGGLE." [ LAUGHTER ]
