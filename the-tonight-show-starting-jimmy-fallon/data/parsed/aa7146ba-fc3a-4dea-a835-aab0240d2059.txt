Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OH MY GOSH. LOOK AT YOU. A GOOD LOOKING CROWD. LOOKING GOOD TONIGHT. LOOKING GOOD NEW YORK, HEY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HERE IS WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT, EVERYBODY. DONALD TRUMP IS STILL THE HEADLINE TODAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S JUST THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING. IN A TELEVISED SPEECH IN SOUTH CAROLINA TODAY, DONALD TRUMP RESPONDED TO CRITICISMS FROM SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM BY GIVING OUT GRAHAM'S PERSONAL CELL PHONE NUMBER. [ LAUGHTER ] WROTE IT DOWN. JUST SHOWED -- GAVE IT TO EVERYBODY. GRAHAM KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP WHEN HE SAW THAT HE HAD MORE THAN ONE MISSED CALL. HE WAS LIKE, "WHAT? FIVE MISSED CALLS. IS IT MY BIRTHDAY OR SOMETHING?" [ LAUGHTER ] TRUMP IS NOT BACKING DOWN. YESTERDAY HE SAID THAT HE DOESN'T NEED TO BE LECTURED BY THE OTHER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. WHO SAYS -- HE SAYS, "THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT." YEAH. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH DONALD TRUMP WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT AND NOW HAS NO BUSINESS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY-O! HO!
Jimmy: I SAW THAT SCOTT WALKER IS CAMPAIGNING IN IOWA. AND HE SAID THAT HE HOPES TO DRIVE HIS RV ACROSS ALL THE STATES' 99 COUNTIES. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH WOULD BE GREAT IF THAT WASN'T THE BACK STORY OF NEARLY EVERY SERIAL KILLER. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE, "I NEED TO HIT THE ROAD. GET OFF THE GRID FOR A WHILE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S MY PET CROW." [ LAUGHTER ] IN A RESENT INTERVIEW, CARLY FIORINA SAID THAT SHE THINKS SHE WILL BE ONE OF THE TOP TEN CANDIDATES INVITED TO THE FIRST REPUBLICAN DEBATE, DESPITE CURRENTLY POLLING 14th. WHICH IS LIKE WHEN I SAID I'D FIND A DATE TO THE PROM HALFWAY THROUGH THE PROM. [ LAUGHTER ] "TELLING YOU GUYS, I'M JUST REALLY PICKY. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, SHELLY, I WAS JUST -- NEVER MIND. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, ROBERTA, I WAS THINKING -- MILDRED, IF YOU HAVE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: MILDRED. THAT WAS HER NAME, MILDRED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Both: SHELLY, ROBERTA AND MILDRED.
Jimmy: THAT'S CORRECT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE THREE HOTTEST GIRLS IN SCHOOL.
Steve: OH, YEAH. IF YOU GO TO SCHOOL IN THE 1890'S.
Jimmy: THE YEAR WAS 1890. [ LAUGHTER ] THE YEAR WAS 1890. THE YEAR OF MILDRED.
Steve: RIDE MY BIG WHEELED BICYCLE.
Jimmy: HERE IS SOME MORE NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON, HERE. I READ THAT REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE GETTING CONCERNED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GONNA TRY THE USE THE FINAL YEAR OF HIS TERM TO PUSH THROUGH TOO MANY CONTROVERSIAL LAWS. YEAH. OBAMA WOULD HAVE RESPONDED, BUT HE WAS BUSY DRAFTING HIS NEW MANDATORY MEXICAN GAY WEED BILL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU HAVE TO DO IT. I SAID SO. DO IT. I DON'T CARE. SPEAKING OF WASHINGTON, I HEARD THAT THE STATE FAIR IN WASHINGTON, D.C. HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL BE HOSTING A A COMPETITION TO SEE WHO'S GROWN THE BEST MARIJUANA PLANT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH GETTING SOMEONE AT A STATE FAIR TO JUDGE WEED IS THAT THERE'S NO ONE LEFT TO RUN THE TILT-A-WHIRL. [ LAUGHTER ] I USUALLY SET IT AND FORGET IT, YOU KNOW, AND JUST LET THEM SPIN AROUND FOR A WHILE. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS WASN'T GOOD HERE. GOOGLE REVEALED LAST WEEK THAT ONE OF ITS PROTOTYPE SELF-DRIVING CARS GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT WHEN IT WAS REAR ENDED BY A NORMAL CAR. ALTHOUGH WHEN THE GUY GOT OUT TO ARGUE AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THE GOOGLE CAR JUST THREATENED TO RELEASE HIS SEARCH HISTORY. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS LIKE, "A LOT OF WEIRD STUFF ON THERE, DAVE. ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU WANT TO DO THIS?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "NO, IT'S MY FAULT. IT'S MY FAULT, GOOGLE CAR. I'M SORRY MAN. I WASN'T WATCHING WHERE I WAS GOING. THAT'S RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW WHO ASHLEY MADISON IS, HONEY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD HERE. I HEARD THAT A BAR IN LONDON IS SERVING DIFFERENT COCKTAILS IN THE FORM OF CLOUDS THAT YOU SIMPLY WALK THROUGH AND INHALE. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE OTHER PLACE WHERE YOU INHALE DRINKS, A WEDDING RECEPTION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IS THIS OVER YET? DID THEY DANCE ALREADY? CUT THE CAKE! YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YEAH, WE LOVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU. YOU LOVE EACH OTHER. LET'S GO. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE SEEN THE NEW CAMPAIGN AD FROM JEB BUSH, BUT THE AD REFERENCES "THE GODFATHER" AND SAID THAT JEB'S NICKNAME USED TO BE VITO CORLEONE, BECAUSE HE VETOED SO MANY BILLS IN FLORIDA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT STORY AGAIN, JEB BUSH HASN'T WATCHED ALL OF "THE GODFATHER." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, JEB BUSH RELEASED A CAMPAIGN AD THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW JEB WAS COMPARED TO VITO CORLEONE FROM "THE GODFATHER." THOUGH, WHEN YOU'RE THE THIRD PERSON IN YOUR FAMILY TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, MAYBE DON'T BRING UP A MOVIE TRILOGY WHERE THE THIRD ONE WAS CLEARLY THE WORST. RIGHT, THAT'S MY IDEA. [ APPLAUSE ] DON'T DO THAT. WE DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT "GODFATHER 3." ONE AND TWO. ACTUALLY, JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CAMPAIGN AD FOR A SECOND.
WHEN JEB BUSH WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR, HE MADE VERY CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT OUR MONEY, IT'S THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY. IF YOUR PROJECT DIDN'T MEET THE PRINCIPLES THAT HE PUT FORTH, HE WAS GOING TO WHACK IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WAIT, WHAT?
Jimmy: CAN WE JUST SEE THAT AGAIN? THE END THERE.
HE WAS GOING TO WHACK IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHEN JEB SAW THAT, HE WAS LIKE --
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. HE WRITES HIS OWN JOKES. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪
