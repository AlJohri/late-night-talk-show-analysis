Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY, THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. THAT IS A FANTASTIC CROWD RIGHT THERE. WELCOME, EVERYONE. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," YOU GUYS. YOU MADE IT. THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS ] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FUN TIME. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, IT'S STILL THE ELECTION. I SAW THAT USA TODAY'S GOP POWER RANKINGS HAD SOME BIG SHAKEUPS THIS WEEK WITH MARCO RUBIO IN THE LEAD. AND CHRIS CHRISTIE IN THE TOP FIVE. THAT'S RIGHT. RUBIO WAS NUMBER ONE, WHILE CHRISTIE IS NUMBERS TWO THROUGH FIVE. VERY INTERESTING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND DID YOU SEE THIS, IN ONE OF HIS BOOKS, BEN CARSON ACTUALLY ADMITTED TO FALLING ASLEEP SEVERAL TIMES DRIVING HIS CAR. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE STARTED TAKING UBERS TO BE SAFE, BUT HIS DRIVERS KEPT FALLING ASLEEP WHILE LISTENING TO HIM TALK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ MUMBLING ] SPEAKING OF BEN CARSON, A NEW POLL SHOWS THAT HE IS LEADING ALL REPUBLICANS WITH 29% OF THE VOTE, FOLLOWED BY DONALD TRUMP AND TED CRUZ. AND THERE ARE A WHOPPING NINE GOP CANDIDATES POLLING AT 2% OR LOWER. SO NOW, HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS CHANCES IS ONE OF THOSE NINE CANDIDATES, LOUISIANA GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL. WELCOME TO THE SHOW, BOBBY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WHOA, ARE YOU SERIOUS? I'M ON NATIONAL TV? AND YOU'RE JIMMY FALLON, LIKE THE FAMOUS JIMMY FALLON?
Jimmy: YEAH.
I'M USED TO APPEARING ON C-SPAN AT LIKE 2:00 A.M. RIGHT BEFORE THEY START AIRING THOSE NUTRI-BULLET INFOMERCIALS. SO THIS IS CRAZY.
Jimmy: YEAH. WELL, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. NOW, BOBBY I HAVE TO SAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING, WHY ARE YOU STAYING IN THE RACE WHEN IT'S NOVEMBER AND YOU'RE STILL ONLY POLLING AT 1%?
I'M GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHT THERE, JIMMY, BECAUSE I'M NOT POLLING AT 1%. I WAS POLLING AT 1%. I'M NOW POLLING AT 2%. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A 100% INCREASE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE. YOU EVER TASTE 1% MILK? IT'S BARELY MILK. IT'S LIKE DRINKING WHITE WATER. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT MAN, WHEN YOU START DUMPING THAT 2% MILK ON YOUR APPLEJACKS. IT'S LIKE, POW! YOU CAN TASTE THE FAT. IT'S A GAME CHANGER. AND ACTUALLY, THAT IS MY NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. JINDAL 2016, TASTE THE FAT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S VERY CATCHY. VERY CATCHY.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: SO, ARE MORE PEOPLE SHOWING UP TO YOUR EVENTS NOW? BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THAT YOU'VE HAD SOME PRETTY SMALL TURNOUTS?
WELL IF YOU CALL PACKING A A LONG JOHN SILVERS TO THE BRIM A SMALL TURNOUT, THEN YEAH, WE'VE HAD SOME SMALL TURNOUTS. [ LAUGHTER ] FULL DISCLOSURE, A FEW OF THOSE PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE COMING TO A MEET AND GREET WITH THE GUY FROM "BIG BANG THEORY," BUT THE TRUTH IS ONCE THEY HEARD MY POLICIES, THEY WERE ONBOARD, AND MY CAMPAIGN IS REALLY STARTING TO HEAT UP.
Jimmy: THAT IS GREAT, THAT IS GREAT TO HEAR. AND SPEAKING OF HEATING UP, I READ THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GLOBAL WARMING, IS THAT TRUE?
ABSOLUTELY, I DON'T BELIEVE IN GLOBAL WARMING. IN FACT, I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT DOESN'T BELIEVE IN ANY SCIENCE, PERIOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN SCIENCE?
JIMMY, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THAT BUY INTO THESE SCIENCE MYTHS, LIKE PHOTOSYNTHESIS, ARE YOU SERIOUS? [ LAUGHTER ] SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT PLANTS ARE TAKING IN SUNLIGHT AND THEN TURNING IT INTO OXYGEN. TO ME, THAT'S LUDICROUS. HOW COULD IT DO THAT? IT'S A PLANT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR BEATING DONALD TRUMP? BECAUSE YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T OUTSPEND HIM.
JIMMY, DONALD TRUMP LIKES TO PRETEND THAT HE'S A GREAT BUSINESSMAN. BUT DID YOU KNOW, HE SPENT A A MILLION DOLLARS ON THOSE STUPID MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN HATS? THAT'S LIKE TWICE WHAT I SPENT ON MY WHOLE CAMPAIGN COMBINED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S CRAZY. HE SPENT MORE ON HATS THAN YOU HAVE ON YOUR WHOLE CAMPAIGN?
YEP, WHICH IS WHY I MADE MY OWN LINE OF MORE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE HATS THAT SHOW WHAT TRUE CONSERVATIVE SPENDING IS. THESE THINGS ONLY COST ME 25 CENTS A POP. [ LAUGHTER ] BOBBY JINDAL, WEAR THE HAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TASTE THE FAT.
Jimmy: PRETTY SMALL HAT. THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US. BOBBY JINDAL, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: TINY HAT.
Steve: TINY HAT.
Jimmy: GUYS, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS. TWITTER JUST CHANGED ITS STAR SHAPED FAVORITE BUTTON TO A A HEART SHAPED LIKE BUTTON. YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT? YEAH, THEY SAID IT'S BECAUSE THE HEART IS MORE OF A A UNIVERSALLY -- IS MORE A A UNIVERSAL SYMBOL OF LIKING SOMETHING. LIKE, HOW PEOPLE WANT TO GO TO MOVIES THAT GETS FOUR HEARTS. OR STAY IN A FIVE-HEART HOTEL.
Steve: YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: MAKES SENSE. TWITTER CHANGED ITS ICON FROM A A STAR TO A HEART. BUT I HEARD THAT ON GOOGLE CHROME, THERE'S A WAY YOU CHANGE THE ICON TO ANY EMOJI YOU CHOOSE. AND IF YOU'RE STILL NOT SATISFIED WITH THE TWITTER ICON, GO OUTSIDE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST GO OUTSIDE. DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. CAN'T HELP YOU. IT'S TWITTER. MEANWHILE, GOOGLE ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL BRING ITS SUPER FAST INTERNET CONNECTION, GOOGLE FIBER, TO CITIES IN FLORIDA. WHICH MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THE FIRST THING PEOPLE IN FLORIDA WILL DO WHEN THEY GET ONLINE IS GOOGLE FIBER. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, LOOK AT ALL THESE METAMUCIL PICTURES. [ LAUGHTER ] WOW. I SAW THAT YESTERDAY AMAZON OPENED ITS FIRST EVER PHYSICAL BOOK STORE IN SEATTLE. IT'S JUST LIKE A NORMAL BOOK STORE, EXCEPT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A BOOK, STRANGERS YELL, "I DIDN'T LIKE IT." [ LAUGHTER ] TWO STAR, I MEAN TWO HEARTS. I ONLY GAVE IT TWO HEARTS. GUYS, TONIGHT WAS THE COUNTRY MUSIC ASSOCIATION AWARDS, AND I SAW THAT IT INCLUDED PERFORMANCES BY KENNY CHESNEY, KEITH URBAN, AND FALLOUT BOY. NOW IT TAPED EARLIER SO WE DON'T KNOW WHO WON NEW ARTIST OR WHO WON BEST FEMALE VOCALIST OR WHY THE HELL FALLOUT BOY WAS THERE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT IT WAS VERY, FIND OUT TOMORROW, MAYBE.
Steve: FALLOUT, BOY.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW, YEAH. FINALLY, LET'S GET TO SOME SPORTS HERE. NFL ANALYST LOUIS RIDDICK WAS ON TV TALKING ABOUT THE WHETHER THE NEW ORLEANS SAINTS HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BEAT THE CAROLINA PANTHERS. AND I'M NOT SURE HE USED THE BEST CHOICE OF WORDS. TAKE A LISTEN TO THIS.
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, WHEN THEY PLAY AGAINST THE BIG BOYS, A TEAM LIKE THE CAROLINA PANTHERS, A TEAM THAT CAN REALLY LINE UP AND SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE GOING TO COME RIGHT HERE, AND RIGHT HERE. RIGHT IN YOUR MOUTH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: THEY SAID, BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THAT. LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOTBALL. [ LAUGHTER ] STAY AWAY FROM THE MOUTH. JUST PUT IT IN THE END ZONE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S PRETTY BAD. I MEAN, THEY WOULD NEVER SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT OVER AT THE NHL.
HE'S STANDING IN FRONT OF THE NET WITH ABOUT EIGHT INCHES OF HIS SHAFT IN HIS HAND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HEY! HEY! HO-HO!
Jimmy: YOU CAN TELL EVEN HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT." YEAH. AND THE EIGHT INCHES OF IT. PRETTY IMPRESSIVE, CONSIDERING HOW COLD IT IS OUT THERE. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, YOU GUYS. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: GREAT CROWD. IT'S BEEN A GREAT WEEK SO FAR. YOU GUYS, THERE'S MORE AHEAD TOMORROW NIGHT. MARTIN SHORT WILL BE HERE, YOU GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SAOIRSE RONAN AND HARRY CONNICK JR. WILL ALL BE JOINING US.

AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY SLEPT SINCE SUNDAY NIGHT. BUT THEY'RE HERE. AND I'M HAPPY FOR THOSE GUYS. WE HAVE GREAT STAND-UP FROM THIS GUY. HE'S JUST THE BEST. HE WAS A WRITER ON OUR SHOW WHEN WE LAUNCHED ON LATE NIGHT, AND JUST BEEN FRIENDS FOR A A LONG TIME. HE HAS HIS FIRST RECORD OUT. WAYNE FEDERMAN IS HERE. HE'S DOING STAND-UP TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "THE CHRONICLES OF FEDERMAN."

Jimmy: YEAH. I CAN'T WAIT. I CAN'T WAIT. WE LOVE WAYNE FEDERMAN. YOU GUYS, WE'RE IN WEEK NINE OF THE NFL SEASON. SUNDAY NIGHT'S BIG MATCHUP IS BETWEEN THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES, [ CHEERS ] AND THE DALLAS COWBOYS.

PLEASE WELCOME OUR PAL, AZIZ ANSARI. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: LOOKING SHARP. YOU'RE LOOKING SHARP, MY MAN.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jimmy: AND THANK YOU FOR DOING THE BOBBY JINDAL EARLIER. I APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME DO IT, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE TIME IS RUNNING LOW ON DOING THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS -- I WAS SO GLAD WE GOT TO DO THAT, BECAUSE A YEAR AGO, I WAS VERY EXCITED BECAUSE HE HAD SOME HEAT. IT WAS LIKE, OH, MAN. I CAN MAYBE DO THIS GUY ON "SNL" OR SOMETHING. IT SEEMED LIKE I FINALLY LOOKED LIKE A GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, LIKE, OF COURSE, NOW IT'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS NICELY, BUT HE [ BLEEP ] THE BED. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, HE'S DOING SO BAD. YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT HIM IS THERE'S A BIG BACKLASH IN THE INDIAN COMMUNITY. INDIAN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE SEEMS TO SHY AWAY FROM TALKING ABOUT HOW HE'S INDIAN AND CALLS HIMSELF BOBBY INSTEAD OF HIS REAL NAME. I ACTUALLY HAVE A THEORY THAT HE'S NOT INDIAN. [ LAUGHTER ] YES, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANY INDIAN PERSON THAT WOULD ALLOW THEMSELVES TO LOSE TO THAT MANY WHITE PEOPLE IN A CONTEST. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NORMALLY, YEAH -- THEY WIN. I'VE GOTTA SAY, ALL AROUND, YOU'RE KILLING IT. YOU KNOW WE'RE BIG FANS HERE. YOU'VE GOT THE BOOK, "MODERN ROMANCE" CAME OUT, WENT TO THE BEST SELLER LIST. THAT'S GIANT. YOU'RE ONE OF THE BIGGEST STAND-UPS WORKING RIGHT NOW, AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS NEW SHOW, "MASTER OF NONE." IT'S ON NETFLIX.
YES.
Jimmy: NOW, WHY NETFLIX? YOU DECIDED TO NOT GO WITH A A NETWORK. YOU WENT RIGHT TO NETFLIX.
NETFLIX-- YOU KNOW, WE WENT TO THEM, AND THEY WERE SO SUPPORTIVE AND THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY ONBOARD. THEY WERE LIKE, WE WANT TO DO 10 EPISODES. I HAD DONE STAND-UP SPECIALS WITH THEM. AND YEAH, IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD FIT FOR THIS PROJECT.
Jimmy: I MEAN, IT'S FANTASTIC, AND YOU'VE GOT A A CRAZY AWESOME CAST IN THERE. ERIC WAREHEIM, FROM "TIM AND ERIC," IF ANY OF YOU KNOW THAT GUY, IS YOUR BEST FRIEND. I LOVE THAT DUDE.
YEAH, ERIC PLAYS MY TOKEN WHITE FRIEND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
WE KIND OF FLIPPED IT. IT'S USUALLY A FEW WHITE PEOPLE AND THEN ONE ASIAN GUY, AND THEY NEVER SEE ANY OTHER ASIAN PEOPLE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS LIKE, IT'S THE REVERSE. ERIC IS MY TOKEN WHITE FRIEND, AND WE GAVE HIM A STEREOTYPICAL WHITE ROLE. HE'S A FULLY ROUNDED CHARACTER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S A FULLY ROUNDED CHARACTER. TODD BERRY IS GREAT IN THIS.
TODD'S GREAT IN IT.
Jimmy: GOSH, HE'S FUNNY. JOHN BENJAMIN, CLAIRE DANES MAKES A CAMEO IN IT.
YEAH, SHE'S REALLY FUNNY. AND NOAH EMMERICH FROM "THE AMERICANS." HE'S GREAT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE GETTING CRAZY GOOD REVIEWS ON IT. YOU'RE DIRECTING IT AS WELL?
I DIRECTED TWO EPISODES. YEAH, IT WAS REALLY FUN.
Jimmy: HOW COOL IS THAT? THAT YOU JUST GET TO DO IT. AND IT CAME OUT PERFECT AND FUN.
YEAH, I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH IT. I THINK PEOPLE WILL DIG IT, YEAH.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW, YOU'RE ACTUALLY, YOUR PARENTS IN THE SHOW ARE YOUR REAL LIFE PARENTS.
YEAH, MY REAL PARENTS PLAYED MY PARENTS. YEAH. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, HOW DID YOU TALK THEM INTO DOING IT, FIRST OF ALL?
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IS I WANTED THOSE CHARACTERS TO FEEL REAL, BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU SEE IMMIGRANT PARENTS ON TV AND FILM, THEY'RE VERY BROAD. AND THEY'RE JUST VEHICLES FOR THESE KIND OF TACKY ETHNIC JOKES WHERE THE DAD WILL BE LIKE, "OH, GOD, THERE'S A A TANDOORI CHICKEN IN MY POCKET." AND IT'S LIKE "WELL -- [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT HAPPENS."
Jimmy: THERE'S A TANDOORI CHICKEN IN MY POCKET.
I'VE BEEN AROUND A LOT OF INDIAN PEOPLE. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TOO OFTEN.
Jimmy: NO, NOT TOO OFTEN. BUT WHEN IT DOES, IT'S FUNNY. IT'S RARE, THOUGH.
I WANTED IT TO FEEL REAL, LIKE MY PARENTS. SO, I WROTE THE CHARACTERS BASED ON MY PARENTS. WHENEVER WE AUDITIONED PEOPLE, WE AUDITIONED SOME ACTORS TO PLAY MY DAD. THE GUY WOULD AND I'D READ THE SCENE, AND BE LIKE "BUT, DAD! BLAH, BLAH, BLAH." AND THE GUY WOULD BE LIKE -- AND AT THE END OF THE AUDITION, HE WOULD GO, "THANKS SO MUCH. IT WAS REALLY FUN READING." I WAS LIKE, WHAT, THAT'S YOUR VOICE? IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE MAKING FUN OF MY DAD. [ BLEEP ] THIS GUY. I'M NOT CASTING HIM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. SO THEN, MOM AND DAD COME IN.
AND THEN I ASKED MY PARENTS TO DO IT. AND MY DAD AND MOM AGREED. AND THEY WERE FANTASTIC. AND YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN REVIEWS WHERE THEY'RE LIKE SINGLING OUT MY DAD, LIKE "OH, MY GOD, SHOUKATH ANSARI STEALS THE SHOW." I'M LIKE, OH, MY GOD.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANTED TO HAPPEN AT ALL.
Jimmy: CREATED A MONSTER.
HE'S ALREADY, LIKE, CALLING ME. HE'S LIKE "OH, WE'VE GOT TO FIND THE NEXT PROJECT FOR ME." [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?" HE'S LIKE, "WELL, DOING THE SHOW IS TOO MUCH WORK. WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING SHORTER, LIKE A COMMERCIAL?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TANDOORI CHICKEN? THERE'S A TANDOORI CHICKEN IN MY POCKET COMMERCIAL.
WELL, I ASKED HIM. I WAS LIKE "WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO DO A COMMERCIAL FOR?" HE WAS LIKE, "ANYTHING." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE WILL DO ANYTHING.
ANY COMMERCIAL. HE DOESN'T CARE. IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN MY DAD -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IN YOUR DAD, YEAH. BASICALLY, IT'S BASED KIND OF A A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR LIFE, YEARS AGO.
IT'S KIND OF. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL, BUT I PLAY AN INDIAN GUY THAT IS AN ACTOR, AND MY PARENTS PLAY MY PARENTS. SO, IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING.
Jimmy: KIND OF, YEAH. IT'S SO AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL, IT'S CRAZY, YEAH.
THERE IS SOME OVERLAP, I THINK THE SAME WAY YOU WATCH CHRIS ROCK IN "TOP FIVE" OR AMY SCHUMER IN "TRAINWRECK." THERE'S DEFINITELY OVERLAP IN MY PERSONALITY AND THIS CHARACTER'S PERSONALITY, AND IT'S A PROXY TO DELIVER MY COMEDIC VIEWPOINT.
Jimmy: WELL THAT'S YOUR VOICE. IN THE SHOW, YOUR CHARACTER DID A GO-GURT COMMERCIAL, AND HE'S PROUD OF THE SLOGAN AND, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE RECOGNIZE HIM. AND HE'S PSYCHED ABOUT THAT STUFF.
PEOPLE SEE HIM ON THE STREET AND THEY RECOGNIZE HIM FROM A A GO-GURT COMMERCIAL WHERE I THINK THE TAGLINE'S SOMETHING LIKE, "WHEN YOU'RE ON THE GO, GRAB A GO-GURT."
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. YEAH, THAT MADE ME LAUGH. IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S AZIZ ANSARI AND NOEL WELLS IN AZIZ'S NEW NETFLIX SERIES "MASTER OF NONE." CHECK THIS OUT.
LOOK AT HER. ISN'T SHE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL YOU'VE EVER SEEN?
SHE IS.
NOW, WHO ARE YOU?
THIS IS MY FRIEND, DEB.
HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU, GRANDMA CAROL.
AH, JUST A FRIEND, NOTHING ROMANTIC HERE?
YEAH, WE'RE SEEING EACH OTHER.
THAT'S GREAT. YOU SEEM VERY NICE.
OH, THANK YOU. I'LL ADMIT, I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED. SOME OF MY FRIENDS HAVE RACIST GRANDMAS.
OH, I SEE, YOU ASSUMED I WAS A RACIST JUST BECAUSE I'M OLD. THAT'S NICE.
WELL, NOW THE TABLES HAVE TURNED. I'M SORRY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, IT WAS A LONG TABLE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO SEE EVERYBODY DO A WAVE AROUND THE TABLE. I DIDN'T KNOW HALF THE PEOPLE THERE, SO I WAS REALLY --
EVENTUALLY, HE GOT IT GOING.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND THEN I KEPT BOTHERING YOU BECAUSE YOU DO AN IMPERSONATION OF ALICIA SILVERSTONE. OF HER, AND IT WAS MAKING ME LAUGH SO HARD. BECAUSE, I WAS SITTING NEXT TO YOU. AND I KEPT SAYING, PLEASE DO IT AGAIN. YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW MY WIFE. DO AT LEAST -- CAUSE YOU DO -- SHE DOES HAVE A CERTAIN WAY OF TALKING.
WELL, SHE -- YEAH, SHE DOES. IT'S LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT GOES ON WITH HER LIPS. AND YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: HOW DO YOU DO THAT WITH YOUR LIPS?
WELL -- I HAVE VERY TALENTED LIPS, ACTUALLY.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, SERIOUSLY. I -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SERIOUSLY, I COULD AMUSE MY CHILDREN FOR HOURS ON END WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE BECAUSE I WOULD GO -- I'D GO, "OH, LET ME JUST PULL THIS STRING. OH, AND THEN THIS ONE."
Jimmy: LOOK AT THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND I GOT THIS ONE TOO.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. IT'S MAKING ME LAUGH THE WHOLE NIGHT. I LOVE THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT. AND YOU KNOW AZIZ. YOU GUYS WORKED TOGETHER AT "PARKS AND RECREATION."

Jimmy: YEAH, LET'S BE SURPRISED ABOUT THAT. YEAH, YEAH. I WANNA BE SURPRISED. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS POSITION HERE. THIS IS -- [ LAUGHTER ] TELL ME ABOUT THIS BOOK. THIS IS, THIS HAS GOT -- HERE'S WHY I LIKE THIS BOOK. IT'S GOT EVERYTHING IN IT. LIKE THIS IS ALL YOUR SECRETS, ALL YOUR TIPS. IT'S ALL --
IT REALLY DOES. IT'S GOT VEGETARIAN AND VEGAN RECIPES BECAUSE YOU REALLY ARE WHAT YOU EAT. IT REALLY IS TRUE. AND EXERCISES --
Jimmy: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN VEGETARIAN?
AND MAKEUP AND EVERYTHING -- HOW LONG, PARDON?
Jimmy: I'M SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A A VEGETARIAN OR A VEGAN?
SINCE I WAS, LIKE, 13 YEARS OLD.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT STUFF DO YOU DO?
I JUST SAW A BOOK ON MY PARENTS' NIGHTSTAND. IT WAS NORMAN MAILER'S "MIAMI AND THE SIEGE OF CHICAGO." AND THERE WAS A VERY GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF THE STOCKYARDS IN CHICAGO. AND I JUST SAID, THAT'S IT. I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT SYSTEM. I LOVE ANIMALS. AND I NEVER ATE ANOTHER BITE OF MEAT AGAIN IN MY LIFE.
Jimmy: WOW, GOOD FOR YOU. THAT'S A TOUGH THING TO DO.
BUT IT'S REALLY -- IT'S SO GOOD FOR YOU. AND IT'S SO GOOD FOR THE PLANET. AND I REALLY ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO CONSIDER IT.
Jimmy: BECAUSE I REMEMBER THIS "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE COVER CAME OUT. AND I GOT TO SAY, YOU LOOK FANTASTIC. PEOPLE WERE LIKE, WHAT? I MEAN, LOOKING FANTASTIC ON THERE.
WELL, THAT WAS -- THAT WAS SUCH A SURPRISE, BECAUSE I WAS TURNING 60. AND "PEOPLE MAGAZINE" SAID, "WE WANT YOU TO COME ON IN A A BATHING SUIT." AND I HAD KIND OF SWORN OFF DOING THAT, LIKE WHEN I WAS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, 35 OR SOMETHING. LIKE, NO MORE. I DON'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW. AND THEN THEY SAID, "JUST DO THIS." AND THEN, BECAUSE OF THAT COVER, PEOPLE STARTED SAYING, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT YOU CAN PUT ON A BATHING SUIT AT 60?"
Jimmy: HARD TO BELIEVE. YEAH.
SO I TRIED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN THIS BOOK.
Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD. I LIKE THIS, TOO. IT HAS RECIPES, IT HAS TIPS, AND ALSO AT THE END IT'S VERY ORGANIZED. YOU'RE LIKE "ALL RIGHT, THIS IS THE EXACT PRODUCTS I USE IN THIS CHAPTER AND THIS IS THE EXACT PRODUCTS I TALK ABOUT IN THIS CHAPTER." IT'S VERY ORGANIZED. IT'S GOOD AND I LOVE THAT. WHOEVER PUT THE BOOK TOGETHER DID A FANTASTIC JOB.
