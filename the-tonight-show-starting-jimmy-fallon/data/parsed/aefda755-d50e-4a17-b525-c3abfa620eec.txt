Steve: A LOT OF MONEY.
Jimmy: CHINA. CHINA. ACTUALLY I READ THAT DONALD TRUMP RAISED A RECORD $90 MILLION IN PRIVATE DONATIONS TO PAY FOR HIS INAUGURATION. TRUMP SAID, "JUST ANOTHER $10 MILLION AND WE CAN COVER MY APPEARANCE FEE." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD. DID YOU SEE THIS ON CHRIS MATTHEWS "HARDBALL?" "HARDBALL WITH CHRIS MATTHEWS" A REPORTER WAS TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA HACKING THE ELECTION. WHEN THERE WAS SOME SORT OF GLITCH ON THE -- ON THE -- ON THE SCREEN. AND IT WAS JUST A WEIRD MOMENT.

THEY WERE REALLY EXPENSIVE.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
AND MY DAD SAID, IF YOU EARN HALF THE MONEY, I'LL PAY THE OTHER HALF. SO, I CUT A LOT OF YARDS, I WAS A BABY-SITTER, I LIKE DID ALL KINDS OF RANDOM JOBS. AND I DIDN'T THINK MY DAD THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DO IT. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON HE MADE THAT DEAL.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH.
BUT I MADE $600 AND I BOUGHT THE BIKE.
Jimmy: YOU DID? A COOL BMX BIKE?
I STILL HAVE IT TO THIS DAY.

YEAH. I DON'T FIT ANYMORE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I HAD A PIECE OF JUNK BIKE AND IT GOT STOLEN, AND I CRIED. I WAS LIKE 10 YEARS OLD. SO THEN I WORKED REALLY HARD. THE FIRST THING I EVER REALLY WORKED FOR AND I KEEP IT NOW TO REMIND ME OF HARD WORK. IF YOU WORK HARD YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH GET ANYTHING YOU WANT, ACHIEVE ANYTHING YOU WANT. AND MY MOM, AT ONE POINT SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU GIVE THE BIKE TO YOUR SON?" AND I'M LIKE, "BECAUSE HE DIDN'T CUT THE GRASS!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GET HIS OWN BIKE!
Jimmy: HE CAN'T TOUCH THAT BIKE. HE COULD HAVE MOWED AS MANY LAWNS AS I DID.
THAT'S MINE!

YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE A A FOOTBALL FAN, I MEAN, OR JUST A FAN, IT'S GOING TO BE A A GREAT -- A GREAT STADIUM TO BE AT TO WATCH A GAME. I MEAN, IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT ATMOSPHERE AND I LOVE, YOU KNOW, DOING IT ON FOX WITH THE GUYS. IT'S ALWAYS FUN WITH THEM, MAN.
Jimmy: YEAH, WHEN YOU SEE THE SUPER BOWL, DO YOU GO, "OH YEAH, BEEN THERE, DONE THAT."
YEAH, I'VE BEEN THERE TWICE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ONE WAS BETTER THAN THE OTHER. LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU WIN SOME. YOU LOSE SOME.
LET ME TELL YOU. SO, YOU WORK SO HARD TO GET THERE, MAN. I FEEL SO BAD WHEN SOMEBODY LOSES BECAUSE I KNOW THAT FEELING, AND I'M STILL SO HAPPY WHEN SOMEONE WINS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT, TOO. BUT WHEN YOU'RE THERE, YOU'RE LIKE, OKAY, I'M GOING TO BE CROWNED THE KING OF THE PROM! THEN THE CONFETTI'S FALLING AND THEY'RE SWEEPING YOU OFF WITH IT, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT. IT'S SO BAD. INSTANTLY DISMISSED.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH, THEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER GUYS JUMPING UP AND DOWN, KISSING THAT TROPHY.
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU JUST FEEL LIKE -- THEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER WHOLE HALF OF SEASON.
YOU HAVE A WHOLE SIX MONTHS TO THINK ABOUT IT AND THEN YOU HOPE YOU MAKE IT BACK. FOR ME I DIDN'T MAKE IT BACK FOR ANOTHER, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO SAY, EIGHT, NINE YEARS.
Jimmy: WOW.
YEAH. I HAD TO STICK AROUND A LONG TIME. SO THEN WHEN WE WON IT THE SECOND TIME, MADE IT -- I WAS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF BUT IT ALSO MADE ME REALIZE WHEN GUYS TAKE IT FOR GRANTED, THAT THEY MADE IT WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG, NEVER DO THAT. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT BACK.
Jimmy: RIGHT, ENJOY IT. BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW. IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: WHO DO WE HAVE, BECAUSE THAT WAS A GREAT GAME LAST NIGHT. GOSH, I THINK THE WHOLE WORLD WATCHED THAT GAME LAST NIGHT. BUT, WHO DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE THERE? YOU GOT FALCONS, YOU HAVE PACKERS. FALCONS-PACKERS. YOU HAVE STEELERS AND PATRIOTS. [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ]
STEELERS, OH, BOY. A LOT OF PATRIOTS FANS. LET'S HEAR STEELERS FANS. [ CHEERS ] [ AUDIENCE BOOS ]
Jimmy: CLAPPING AND BOOING. ONE GUY WENT, YEAH, BOO! HE JUST WANTED TO BE ON TV.
WE DON'T KNOW WHO HE'S HERE TO BOO FOR TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I THINK IN THE AFC -- I THINK THE, I THINK IT PITTSBURGH MIGHT PULL AN UPSET THIS YEAR. [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ] [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] I REALLY DO. YOU GOT A PROBLEM. COME ON DOWN HERE AND TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, HEY! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN'T -- FIRST OF ALL -- NO. I WOULD, NO ONE WANTS TO MESS WITH YOU, NO. BUT WAIT. I'M SORRY.
I SAID THE STEELERS COULD PULL THE UPSET AGAINST THE PATRIOTS.
Jimmy: NO WAY! NOT IN A LIFETIME.
IF YOU WATCH THE HOUSTON TEXANS, THEY HAD A SHOT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THEY JUST TURNED THE BALL OVER. HOUSTON, TEXAS OFFENSE IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM NEAR WHAT PITTSBURGH HAS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE QUARTERBACK THAT HE HAS. AND DEFENSIVELY HOUSTON HAS A A REALLY GOOD DEFENSE, BUT PITTSBURGH PUTS GOOD PRESSURE ON THE QUARTERBACK. AND FROM MY SUPER BOWL EXPERIENCE, TOM BRADY DOES NOT LIKE PRESSURE. [ CHEERS ] SO I'M JUST SAYING, I FEEL LIKE, IF THERE'S ANYBODY'S GOING TO PULL AN UPSET IT WILL BE THEM.
Jimmy: CAN I ASK, WHERE ARE THEY PLAYING?
THEY ARE PLAYING IN BOSTON.
Jimmy: BOSTON FANS, THEY JUST, THEY ARE THE SECRET PLAYERS.
FANS HAVE NOTHING DO WITH IT. THEY'RE NOT IN UNIFORM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT IS NOT TRUE BECAUSE THESE GUYS ALL HOST "THE TONIGHT SHOW" WITH ME! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SO WHO DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY? YOU THINK STEELERS?
IN MY HEART WHO I WISH WOULD GO ALL THE WAY, I'M A BIG AARON RODGERS, PACKERS' FAN. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: ME TOO. I LIKE THAT DUDE. HE'S A GOOD DUDE.
BUT, ATLANTA. I REALLY HOPE ATLANTA WINS. [ CHEERS ] I REALLY DO.
Jimmy: REALLY?
MATT RYAN IS OVERDUE. I MEAN, MATTY ICE IS OVERDO. PLAYED EXTREMELY WELL, THE DEFENSE IS CATCHING UP TO THE OFFENSE, BECAUSE THAT WAS THEIR PROBLEM EARLIER IN THE YEAR. I MEAN, JULIO JONES, THE BEST RECEIVER IN FOOTBALL, WHO IS THE MOST NON-ASSUMING, NICEST GUY, DOESN'T CARE IF HE CATCHES 20 BALLS AS GAME HE JUST WANTS TO WIN. AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT HIM, AND THAT'S WHY, I RESPECT THAT ABOUT TOM BRADY AS WELL, ON THE OTHER SIDE. YOU HAVE SUPERSTARS, WHO ARE SUPERSTARS AND THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOOD, BUT THEY DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE THE FOCUS FOR WINNING THE GAME. I JUST LOVE THAT HUMBLENESS ABOUT HIM AND THE ATLANTA FALCONS SO I HOPE THAT THEY GO ALL THE WAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I LOVE, YOU NEVER KNOW WHO'S GOING TO WIN. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE EXCITING EITHER WAY. AND I GOT TO SAY CONGRATS ON "THE PYRAMID" TOO, BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU CRUSH IT NOW, PICKED UP FOR SEASON TWO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU'RE JUST CRUSHING EVERYTHING. I WANT TO SEE TONIGHT HOW YOU WOULD BE AS A PLAYER.
