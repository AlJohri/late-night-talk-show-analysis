SMASHED MY NOSE COMPLETELY. HAD A CAST ON IT.

YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE A SONG FOR YOU. YOU'VE GOT TO HEAR THIS. OH, MY GOSH. I HAVE A SONG FOR YOU. WHERE IS IT? I'LL PLAY IT LATER. I'LL PLAY IT LATER. THIS RAP, YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY. THIS GUY BLOWS THOM YORKE OUT OF THE WATER, YEAH. BUT HE WAS A -- BECAUSE THE DOCTORS ALL USE COCAINE TO STAY UP -- STAY AWAKE AND DO SURGERIES AND ALL THIS STUFF. AND THEN HE JUST BECAME ADDICTED TO COCAINE. AND THEN TO GET YOU OFF THE COCAINE --
YOU KNOW, IT'S TRUE. AT THE TIME "THE KNICK" IS SET, COCAINE WAS TOTALLY LEGAL. THEY -- IT TOOK THEM SEVEN YEARS TO DISCOVER THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH THE DRUG. THEN THEY REALIZED THAT PEOPLE WERE GETTING THIS THING THEY CALLED COCAINE FRENZY. AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST WAY OF TREATING IT WAS TO GIVE THEM HEROIN TO CALM THEM DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WINNING. FANTASTIC IDEA. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. SO NOW YOU'RE ADDICTED TO HEROIN, RIGHT?

I JUST SAID "YEAH." YOU KNOW, WHATEVER THE PRESIDENT DID, I JUST CO-SIGNED.
Jimmy: YEAH. I MEAN WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IN THE MORNING ON THE ANNOUNCEMENTS? DO YOU REMEMBER?
HI, THIS IS NIKKI UNION AND WELCOME TO FOOTHILL HIGH SCHOOL. AND THIS MORNING, IT'S, YOU KNOW, EAT YOGURT OR WHATEVER WE WERE TRYING TO PUSH THAT DAY.
Jimmy: EAT YOGURT. THAT'S GOOD. YEAH. WE'D TRY TO SNEAK IN JOKES. LIKE, WE WOULD PLAY OTHER HIGH SCHOOLS IN FOOTBALL AND THEY'RE LIKE THIS WEEKEND, WE'RE PLAYING MARLBORO, WHICH IS A A SCHOOL. AND SO I SAID, SO LET'S GO OUT THERE, LET'S DO IT. LET'S TRY TO SMOKE MARLBORO THIS WEEKEND, YOU GUYS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE THOUGHT THAT WAS FUNNY.
WAY MORE CLEVER.
Jimmy: WE THOUGHT THAT WAS FUNNY. WE GOT IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T SMOKE MARLBOROS OR DO OR WHATEVER. ASK YOUR PARENTS. WHY WOULD A PARENT SAY YES, TOO? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN IT'S TOUGH TO GO DOWN AND SPEND TIME -- LIVING WITH YOUR PARENTS. IF THEY WANT YOU. THERE'S OTHER CHOICES. YOU CAN SMOKE WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE SMOKING. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MARLBORO. [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU BELIEVE I'M A DAD? ISN'T THAT COOL? [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S SO --
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT FUN? THANK GOD I HAVE MY WIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] LeBRON JAMES WAS ON OUR SHOW LAST TIME, A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. AND HE BROUGHT THIS PHOTO OF YOU. THAT'S YOU, AND YOU'RE ALL RIDING A BANANA.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S YOUR HUSBAND. AND THEN IS THIS CHRIS PAUL? AND THAT THAT'S LeBRON JAMES RIDING A BANANA. AND HE SAID THAT HE'S PHOTO SHOPPED AND HE'S NOT REALLY ON THIS BANANA.
NOT ONLY IS HE NOT PHOTO SHOPPED. EVERYONE WAS VERY GEEKED TO GET ON THIS BANANA. WE WERE GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS LIKE THE FIRST COUPLE DAYS ABOUT PAPARAZZI AND YOU KNOW, GETTING PHOTOGRAPHED IN A A COMPROMISING POSITION OR SOMETHING.
Jimmy: WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE RIDING A BANANA. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT WAS THE ONLY THING WE HAD NOT TRIED ON THE BOAT. AND I WAS LIKE, "YOU GUYS WE HAVE TO DO THE BANANA. WHO'S EVEN -- NO ONE'S GOING TO SEE THIS."
Jimmy: YEAH.
CUT TO.
Jimmy: CLEARLY. BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE LOOKING AHEAD. THE OTHER ONES ARE SEEING THE CAMERAMAN GOING -- [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR OUR IMAGE. WE'RE BASKETBALL PLAYERS. WE'RE BASKETBALL LEGENDS.
I'M JUST SO FOCUSED.
Jimmy: YOU'RE ENJOYING -- YOU'RE FOCUSED.
I WAS SO FOCUSED ON THE BANANA FUN. I LOVE THAT BANANA.
Jimmy: YOU REALLY DID. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, VERY NICE.
GO SMOKE MARLBOROS.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. THEN, SO IT IS A REAL PHOTO. YOU GUYS JUST WENT ON VACATION TOGETHER?
YEAH, THIS IS OUR FIRST ANNUAL TRIP. AND LeBRON AND HIS WIFE, AND CHRIS PAUL AND HIS WIFE, AND CARMELO ANTHONY AND LA LA COME, AND WE ALL CHOOSE, YOU KNOW, EACH YEAR, WE'LL ALTERNATE. AND THIS YEAR, THAT YEAR, LeBRON AND HIS WIFE CHOSE.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S FUN.
YEAH --
Jimmy: BUT THEN THERE'S ANOTHER PHOTO I SAW HERE. THIS IS, I HEARD ABOUT THIS. EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
THOSE ARE THE INFAMOUS SWIMMING PIGS OF EXUMA.
Jimmy: NO, I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS. SO AGAIN, THAT'S LeBRON. [ LAUGHTER ] AGAIN, THESE PICTURES, I THINK THEY ARE PHOTOSHOPPED. HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT. HE NORMALLY WEARS A ONE PIECE. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, BUT THIS IS YOU, CLEARLY, BUT THE SWIMMING PIGS. I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS. THE PIGS COME IN AND SWIM WITH YOU?
WE GO IN AND SWIM WITH THE PIGS. THIS IS THEIR NATURAL HABITAT.
Jimmy: THE OCEAN?
YEAH. SOMEBODY BROUGHT THEM IN, AND THEY JUST ADAPTED. AND SO THEY'RE JUST OUT THERE --
Jimmy: SOME KID IS TUNING IN RIGHT NOW GOING, "WHAT IS GOING ON, DUDE? [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S LIKE SWIMMING PIGS." WHAT IS -- BUT THEY DO, THEY SWIM WITH YOU.
YES. THEY LITERALLY --
Jimmy: I SAW THIS ON YOUTUBE.
YEAH, THEY LEGIT -- WELL, THEY WERE ONLY SWIMMING WITH ME. NOBODY ELSE GOT OFF THE BOAT. AFTER THEY DROPPED THAT --
Jimmy: WHAT, THEY WERE AFRAID?
-- THE BANANA BOAT, AFTER THE BANANA BOAT, THEY DREW THE LINE. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, I WAS OUT THERE ALONE WITH THE PIGS.
Jimmy: THAT'S FUN. YOU DO FUN, COOL THINGS. WE GOT TO SAY THAT. AND WITH YOUR HUSBAND, WHO I JUST SAW. YOU CELEBRATED YOUR FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.
YES. YES.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING MARRIED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DID HE DO IT UP? DID HE DO IT RIGHT?
HE DID. HE PLANNED A WHOLE SURPRISE ANNIVERSARY TRIP TO BORA BORA. DIDN'T TELL ME WHERE WE WERE GOING.
Jimmy: HEY.
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I MEAN HE'S COME A LONG WAY. WHEN I MET HIM, HE WAS WEARING BEDAZZLED JEANS. [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T -- I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS GONNA --
Jimmy: WHAT? HE WAS WEARING BEDAZZLED JEANS?
OH, BEDAZZLED LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT AT 15. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS -- THEY WERE.
Jimmy: I GOT TO GET HIM TO WEAR THEM NEXT TIME HE COMES ON.
FIRMLY BEDAZZLED. YOU KNOW, LIKE, THEY CALLED HIM FLASH. AND HE HAS, ON HIS POCKETS, BEDAZZLED FLASHES. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH.
Jimmy: HE'S GOT TO STILL HAVE THOSE JEANS SOMEWHERE, PLEASE.
I HOPE SO. JUST FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT.
Jimmy: JUST STORE THEM FOR NEXT YOU COME ON. I WANT TO HOLD THESE JEANS UP AND MAYBE WEAR THEM. THAT'D BE AWESOME. [ LAUGHTER ] CONGRATS ON THE SHOW. THIS IS SEASON --
THREE.
Jimmy: SEASON THREE COMING UP NOW. IT'S A TWO-HOUR PREMIERE.
YES.
Jimmy: AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PREMIERE?
SO IT PICKS UP RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF LAST SEASON. THERE WAS A CAR CRASH, AND SHE'S CRASHED HER CAR AFTER HEARING HER BEST FRIEND AND THE LOVE OF HER LIFE CHITCHATTING ABOUT THEM HOOKING UP. AND -- I GET INTO A CAR ACCIDENT. AND IT PICKS UP RIGHT WHERE IT LEFT OFF. SO, SHE'S, YOU KNOW, NOT WORKING. SHE DOESN'T HAVE HER BEST FRIEND, AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE HER MAN. AND SHE'S JUST CIRCLING THE DRAIN PRETTY MUCH.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. WELL, WE LOVE HAVING YOU ON THE SHOW. COME BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON, WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT. WE'LL DO MORE MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS. WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
