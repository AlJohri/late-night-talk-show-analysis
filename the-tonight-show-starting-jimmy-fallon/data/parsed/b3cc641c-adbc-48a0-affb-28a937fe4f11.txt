Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WELCOME. WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT WE GET. YOU GET THAT. THE BEST CROWD IN THE WORLD. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. WHAT A SHOW TONIGHT. WE HAVE KHLOE KARDASHIAN ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS ] WE ALSO HAVE DANNY DeVITO ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHICH EXPLAINS THIS EPISODE'S TITLE, "LOOKING UP AT THE KARDASHIANS." "IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU." [ LAUGHTER ] GUYS, WELCOME. OF COURSE, LET'S GET TO THE NEWS HERE. THE BIG STORY IS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE HIS FINAL STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS LAST NIGHT. YEAH. HE STARTED BY SAYING HE WOULD GIVE A SHORTER SPEECH, AND MAYBE IT'S JUST ME, BUT THAT SEEMED TO GET THE MOST APPLAUSE OF THE NIGHT. CHECK IT OUT.
FOR THIS FINAL ONE, I'M GOING TO TRY TO MAKE IT A A LITTLE SHORTER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: EVEN MICHELLE -- EVEN, MICHELLE, YEAH, SHE LOVES IT, YEAH. OBAMA SAID HE WOULD GIVE A A SHORTER SPEECH, AND THEN WOUND UP SPEAKING FOR 59 MINUTES. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT SURPRISING, OBAMA SAYING HE'S GOING TO KEEP IT SHORT IS LIKE DONALD TRUMP SAYING, "ENOUGH ABOUT ME." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "FOUR BILLION. I'M A HUMAN POWERBALL." [ LAUGHTER ] DURING HIS SPEECH, PRESIDENT OBAMA CRITICIZED COMPANIES FOR NOT BEING LOYAL ENOUGH TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. YEAH, EMPLOYEES WOULD AGREE, BUT THEY WERE BUSY BUYING POWERBALL TICKETS SO THEY COULD QUIT THEIR JOB. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "I'M NOT THAT LOYAL. BYE!"
Steve: BYE!
Jimmy: BYE, STEVE! "I'M GOING TO BE ON AN ISLAND, DUDE, THAT I OWN." YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] DID YOU SEE THIS? AT ONE POINT, WHILE OBAMA WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY, JOE BIDEN LEANED OVER TO HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN AND WHISPERED SOMETHING THAT THEY BOTH LAUGHED ABOUT. BIDEN SAID IT WAS A PRIVATE JOKE BETWEEN TWO STATESMEN, WHILE RYAN SAID, "HE JUST WHISPERED THE WORD 'BOOBS.'" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GROW UP. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? IT'S THE STATE OF THE UNION. IT'S HIS LAST ONE, THE LAST ONE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. THAT'S RIGHT, IT WAS OBAMA'S SEVENTH AND FINAL STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, AND BECAUSE IT WAS THE LAST ONE, THEY DECIDED TO END IT IN A SPECIAL WAY, WHICH KIND OF SURPRISED ME. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS STRONG. ♪♪ ♪ DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME WILL YOU STAND ABOVE ME LOOK MY WAY ♪ ♪ NEVER LOVE ME RAIN KEEPS FALLING RAIN KEEPS FALLING DOWN ♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: HERE'S THE LATEST ON THE ELECTION. NEW POLLS FOUND THAT BERNIE SANDERS IS NOW AHEAD OF HILLARY CLINTON AMONG DEMOCRATS IN BOTH IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND EVEN HILLARY'S LEAD IN NATIONAL POLLS IS DWINDLING. I DON'T WANT TO SAY HILLARY IS UPSET, BUT THIS MORNING SHE WAS SPOTTED SHOUTING INTO A A VOLCANO, "YOU SAID WE HAD A A DEAL!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. BERNIE IS REALLY PICKING UP SOME MOMENTUM. IN FACT, YESTERDAY, HE RECEIVED AN ENDORSEMENT FROM THE PROGRESSIVE WEBSITE, moveon.org. AS OPPOSED TO JEB BUSH WHO WAS ENDORSED BY THE WEBSITE, noseriouslymoveon.org. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO SERIOUSLY, TOTALLY DIFFERENT WEBSITE. CHECK THIS OUT, I READ THAT THE SHIRT THAT EL CHAPO WORE IN HIS RECENT PHOTO WITH SEAN PENN APPARENTLY IS FLYING OFF THE SHELVES AT THE STORE THAT MAKES IT IN LOS ANGELES. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SHIRT. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT LOOKS LESS LIKE A DRUG LORD AND MORE LIKE MARIO IF HE BECAME A HAIRDRESSER. [ LAUGHTER ] DOESN'T IT LOOK LIKE THAT? [ APPLAUSE ] "IT'S-A ME!"
Steve: "IT'S-A ME! EL CHAPO!"
Jimmy: "I'LL JUST TAKE A A LITTLE OFF THE TOP." [ LAUGHTER ] CAN WE SEE THAT PICTURE ONE MORE TIME? LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] IS IT ME, OR DOES EL CHAPO LOOK LIKE A GUY WHO LIVES IN HOLLYWOOD AND SEAN PENN LOOKS LIKE A DUDE WHO'S ON THE RUN? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] GOT THE BEARD. WELL, THIS IS GREAT. AN 88-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER TRIED OUT VIRTUAL REALITY FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND SHE WAS PRETTY IMPRESSED. CHECK THIS OUT.
DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
OH, MY GOODNESS. OH! OH! [ LAUGHTER ] AH! AH! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "NEXT YEAR PEOPLE." I'M IN A GREAT MOOD TONIGHT. BECAUSE WELL, LAST NIGHT WAS THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.

Jimmy: SPEAKING OF KANYE, HE ACTUALLY SHOUTED US OUT IN HIS LATEST SONG. THE ROOTS AND I.
YEAH. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
Jimmy: YEAH. PRETTY COOL, MAN. GIVES ME A LOT OF STREET CRED.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I WALK AROUND WITH A BOOMBOX CRANKING IT. THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.
HE SHOUTED YOU OUT.
Jimmy: YEAH HE DID. THAT WAS COOL OF HIM. HE JUST RELEASED HIS SONGS NOW. THIS IS FOR SWISH OR WE'RE NOT SURE IF IT'S FOR SWISH.
WELL HE HAS SO MANY DOPE SONGS THAT HE'S JUST, YOU KNOW, SHELLING THEM OUT FOR FREE ALL OF A SUDDEN.
Jimmy: THROWING THEM OUT.
HE IS.
Jimmy: DO YOU HEAR THEM BEFORE HE RELEASES THEM?
YES. HE HAS A STUDIO IN HIS HOUSE, AND WE LIVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. AND WE GO TO A STUDIO AND WE HEAR HIS ALBUM. I LOVE THAT HE TAKES ALL OUR CRITICISM OR OUR COMPLIMENTS SERIOUSLY AND HE REALLY WANTS OUR OPINIONS. I LOVE THAT. SO WE HEAR IT ALL. I LOVE HIS MUSIC. HIS ALBUM IS GOING TO BE SO INSANE.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH, I THINK HE'S RELEASING A NEW SONG EVERY FRIDAY?
Jimmy: HE DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT ALL THE TIME.
YEAH. HE'S AHEAD OF HIS TIME.
Jimmy: HE REALLY IS.
I LOVE THE GUY. YEEZY FOR PRESIDENT, PEOPLE. [ CHEERS ]

THANK YOU. YOU LOOKED THROUGH OR READ IT.
Jimmy: I -- READ IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WELL, I READ --
IT'S MOTIVATING.
Jimmy: IT'S VERY MOTIVATING. VERY MOTIVATIONAL. ONE THING I TOOK FROM IT -- A A LOT OF THINGS I TOOK FROM IT. BUT, ONE IS WATER. DRINK LOTS OF WATER.
DRINK LOTS OF WATER, YEAH. DRINK YOUR WATER AND MIND YOUR BUSINESS TODAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HERE'S WHAT I LIKE. YOU HAVE THIS RIGHT HERE, RIGHT? AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO STAY MOTIVATED, YOU BUY THE BOOK, RIGHT? AND THEN YOU TAKE THE COVER OFF THE BOOK. RIGHT?
THIS IS FOR ALL MY MEN.
Jimmy: YEAH, I'M GOING TO PUT THIS RIGHT ABOVE THE TREADMILL. MY WIFE IS GOING TO LOVE THIS.
YAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AND THEN -- YEAH, THAT'S MOTIVATIONAL RIGHT THERE. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. [ LAUGHTER ] ABSOLUTELY. BUT CONGRATS ON THE BOOK. WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO DO THIS? BECAUSE EVERYONE IS ASKING YOU?
YEAH, I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN ON A WAIT LOSS JOURNEY FOR QUITE SOME TIME, BUT IT STARTED REALLY ORGANICALLY, IT WAS MORE OF A STRESS RELIEVER. I NEEDED TO RELIEVE STRESS AND GO TO THE GYM. AS A BY-PRODUCT, I STARTED LOSING WEIGHT. WHO DOESN'T LIKE THAT?
Jimmy: IF YOU GO TO THE GYM, WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU GO DO? WHAT IS THE PEOPLE SAY I CAN LOSE CALORIES? DO YOU DO LEGS, WEIGHTS?
I'M A LEG AND ASS GIRL, BUT I INCORPORATE THAT.
Jimmy: ME TOO. ME TOO. ME TOO, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH. GO, SISTER.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
BUT I DO THAT WITH THE STAIRS. YOU GET CARDIO AND IT'S LIKE DOING LUNGES AND SQUATS. I LOVE TO DO THE STAIRS AT THE GYM. AND I WILL TURN ON TV.
Jimmy: YOU LOVE DOING THE STAIRS?
I LOVE IT. I TURN ON THE TV AND I'M LIKE WATCHING A TV SHOW THAT I GET LOST IN.
Jimmy: REALLY?
AND I'M DRIPPING WET, AND I LOVE SOUL CYCLE, ALL THOSE SPIN CLASSES.
Jimmy: SPIN CLASSES. YEAH, YOU SWEAT A LOT.
I'M SINGING IN THOSE CLASSES. SOMEONE MOVED A BIKE FROM ME BECAUSE I WAS SINGING BEYONCE SO LOUD. THEY WERE ANNOYED WITH ME SO THEY GOT OFF THE BIKE.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH.
BUT IT'S FUN.
Jimmy: IS THIS WHAT HAPPENS ON YOUR TALK SHOW? "KOCKTAILS WITH KHLOE," IS THIS A DRINKING SHOW? WHAT IS THIS SHOW?
IT'S A DRINKING SHOW, I WOULD SAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S BASICALLY LIKE PLAYING CHARADES DRUNK.
Jimmy: YEAH.

Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I DO EVERY OTHER WEEK. FANTASTIC. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OUR PAL ANDY COHEN HAS A SHOW, AND HE HAS DRINKS WITH HIS CELEBRITIES. HE TELLS ME SOMETIMES IT GETS CRAZY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HAS IT EVER GOTTEN CRAZY WITH YOU?
I DID A TEST SHOW THE OTHER DAY, AND MY MOM AND MY BEST FRIEND FROM THE TEST SHOW. MY MOM GOT SO HAMMERED. I WAS SO PISSED AT THE SAME TIME. I'M LIKE, DUDE, IT'S MY FIRST TIME. REEL IT IN A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: KRIS GOT WASTED?
AND SHE WOULD NOT -- SHE WAS DRINKING VODKA STRAIGHT, WHICH I DID NOT KNOW.
Jimmy: OH, NO! [ LAUGHTER ]
I WAS LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS FEEDING HER?
Jimmy: THAT DOESN'T END WELL.
NO.
Jimmy: THAT DOESN'T END WELL.
SHE WAS A SLOB. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SHE HAS GREAT INTENTIONS. YOU KNOW WHAT. IT TAUGHT ME HOW TO REEL SOMEONE IN.
Jimmy: YEAH. WILL THAT AIR? OR WAS IT JUST A TEST?
IT WAS A TEST SHOW, BUT WE TAPED IT AND RECORDED IT. WE'RE GOING TO BE EDITING IT, BUT THAT WOMAN WAS A A SLOB-KABOB. [ LAUGHTER ]
