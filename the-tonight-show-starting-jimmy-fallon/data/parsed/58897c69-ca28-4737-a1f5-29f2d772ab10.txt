Steve: ARE YOU SERIOUS? THAT'S A BIG FLUB.
Jimmy: THE TYPE OF MISTAKE THAT CAN GET YOU IN TROUBLE WITH THE ACADEMY. BUT WHAT A NIGHT. OH, MY GOSH. YOU HAD BEST ACTRESS GOING TO CATE BLANCHETT. JARED LETO GOT BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY MOTHER -- YOU KNOW, HE THANKED HIS MOTHER IN THAT, BY THE WAY. IT WAS A GREAT SPEECH, HE THANKED HIS MOM. MY MOM CALLED ME TODAY, SHE SAID, "MY FAVORITE SPEECH WAS JARED LETO." [ LAUGHTER ] "YEAH, HE HAD THE BEST SPEECH."

I'M NEVER GOING TO WIN AN OSCAR. [ LAUGHTER ] THE BEST PICTURE WENT TO "12 YEARS A SLAVE." [ CHEERS ] GOOD FOR THAT. THAT WAS PERFECT, BECAUSE BEST PICTURE ALMOST WENT TO THIS -- BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEST PICTURE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I WAS LIKE -- IT BECAME THE MOST RETWEETED PHOTO OF ALL-TIME. CAN WE SEE THAT ONE MORE TIME? YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. [ CHEERS ] BRAD AND ANGELINA HADN'T POSED WITH THAT MANY PEOPLE SINCE THEY TOOK THEIR FAMILY PHOTO AT CHRISTMAS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS VERY EXCITING FOR ALL OF THEM. [ APPLAUSE ] AND DID YOU SEE THIS? THE FILM "TWENTY FEET FROM STARDOM," WON BEST DOCUMENTARY. [ CHEERS ] AND WHEN SHE WAS ONSTAGE TO ACCEPT THE AWARD, DARLENE LOVE STARTED SINGING. IT WAS GREAT. I MEAN, JOHN TRAVOLTA WAS LIKE, "WOW, SHE'S ALMOST AS GOOD AS ADELE DAZEEM."

OF COURSE, THE WORLD IS STILL FOCUSED ON THE ONGOING CONFLICT IN THE UKRAINE. AND OVER THE WEEKEND, SARAH PALIN REMINDED EVERYONE THAT DURING THE 2008 ELECTION, SHE PREDICTED RUSSIA WOULD INVADE THE UKRAINE. THEN JOHN McCAIN SAID, "WELL AT LEAST ONE OF US MADE A GOOD CALL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND GET THIS. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY WENT ON "MEET THE PRESS" YESTERDAY. AND ACTUALLY CRITICIZED RUSSIA FOR ITS ACTION IN THE UKRAINE. HE SAID, QUOTE, "YOU DON'T JUST INVADE ANOTHER COUNTRY ON PHONY PRETEXT IN ORDER TO ASSERT YOUR INTEREST." THEN HE SAID, "I MEAN, WE STOPPED DOING THAT, LIKE, MONTHS AGO. OKAY. WE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE." [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S SO 2013, MAN. WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ] I SWEAR, BACK IN '07.
Steve: -- THAT'S WHAT JOE TOLD HIM.
Jimmy: AND WHILE ALL OF THIS IS GOING ON, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS STAYING VERY BUSY. THAT'S RIGHT. ON FRIDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK A SELFIE WITH BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY AND ASTROPHYSICIST NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. I HEARD THAT PHOTO SET THE RECORD FOR THE LEAST RETWEETED PHOTO OF ALL TIME. VERY INTERESTING. IN THE SAME WEEK --ALL THIS STUFF WAS HAPPENING. WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: I WAS READING ABOUT THIS, THIS DOESN'T REALLY SURPRISE ME. A NEW SURVEY HAS FOUND THAT ALMOST HALF OF DOG OWNERS ADMIT THEY'RE SPENDING MORE MONEY ON THEIR DOGS THAN ON THEY ARE ON THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS. [ LAUGHTER ] I TRIED TO ASK MY WIFE IF THAT'S TRUE, BUT SHE AND OUR DOG WERE OUT TO DINNER. AND I WAS LIKE, "WELL, CAN YOU GUYS AT LEAST BRING HOME A A JIMMY BAG SO I CAN HAVE SOME?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I PEED ON THE CARPET. [ CHEERS ] I'M A MESS. I WANTED TO SHOW THEM THAT I WAS UPSET! DON'T GO OUT WITHOUT ME! AND FINALLY, THIS IS GREAT. I SAW THIS CLIP ON YOUTUBE TODAY. IT'S REALLY FUNNY. A LOCAL NEWS REPORTER IN PHILADELPHIA WAS STANDING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD COVERING TODAY'S BIG SNOWSTORM. WHEN A PLOW DROVE BY AND JUST NAILED HIM WITH SNOW. WATCH THIS.
Reporter: WE ONLY HAD ONE SUMMER WITH THE PHILLIES. THERE'S GOES A COUPLE OF PLOWS DEMONSTRATING WHAT I -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

[ CHEERS ] IF YOU GUYS HAVE DONE IT -- SO, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. THE MAYOR OF CHICAGO, I SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIM JOKINGLY IN THE PAPER, IN THE "CHICAGO SUN-TIMES." SOMETHING LIKE, I WAS AFRAID OF HIM OR SOMETHING, BECAUSE I AM. I KNOW. BUT JUST KIDDING AROUND. AND THEN, SO HE GOT ON TWITTER. AND I RESPECT THIS MAYOR BECAUSE HE'S INVOLVED WITH SOCIAL MEDIA. AND HE TWEETED OUT, HE SAID -- "JIMMY FALLON, I THINK YOU SHOULD TOUGHEN UP." HE GOES, "I CHALLENGE YOU TO COME TO CHICAGO AND DO THE POLAR PLUNGE." SO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. BUT I GO, "YEAH, I'M IN." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN I FIND OUT WHAT IT IS. AND IT'S -- YEAH. SO I WENT. I FLEW MYSELF TO CHICAGO THIS WEEKEND. WENT TO CHICAGO AND, MAN. IT WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE. THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL OUT THERE DOING THAT. I THINK THEY DOUBLED THE AMOUNT OF NORMAL PEOPLE GOING OR DOUBLED THE AMOUNT OF DONATIONS. ALL THE MONEY WENT TO SPECIAL OLYMPICS. IT WAS LIKE 3,000 PEOPLE THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S A GREAT CAUSE.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: PEOPLE GET OUT THERE. I MEAN -- ISRAEL IDONIJE IS DOING IT, WITH THE MAYOR. HE HAD THIS THING WHERE THE MAYOR ASKED ALL OF THESE KIDS IF THEY WENT TO THE LIBRARY -- AND READ OVER 1.5 MILLION BOOKS THROUGH THE SUMMER, THAT HE WOULD JUMP IN THE WATER. THAT'S HOW IT, HOW IT STARTED. SO THE KIDS READ 2 MILLION BOOKS. SO NOW, HE'S LIKE, "OH, GREAT. NOW I GOT TO GO INTO THIS THING." SO HE DRAGGED ME INTO IT. SO ANYWAYS, I'M GETTING READY TO GO INTO IT. I'M WATCHING VIDEOS. PEOPLE ARE SENDING ME THINGS AND ADVICE ON HOW TO DO IT. ONE GUY IS LIKE, "JIMMY, YOU KNOW, I'M AN ARCTIC SWIMMER, YOU KNOW, IF YOU GET IN THE WATER -- YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE HAVING A HEART ATTACK." I JUST PAUSED IT RIGHT THERE. I GO, "THANKS FOR THE ADVICE, PAL. APPRECIATE IT." AND SO I GET THERE, AND I -- I SEE THESE EMTs. NOT -- NOT ENTs. NOT EAR NOSE THROAT DOCTORS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE NOT GOING GET A SINUS INFECTION. YOU MIGHT DIE. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. YOU MIGHT DIE IF YOU GO IN THIS THING. AND THERE ARE TWO ICEBERGS. AND THEY HAD TO GET A BULLDOZER TO PLOW OUT THE ICE BEFORE I JUMPED IN THE WATER. I MEAN THIS IS INSANE. CHICAGO DIDN'T LET ME FOOL AROUND. THEY DIDN'T FOOL AROUND THIS TIME. THEY HAD, LIKE, A BLIZZARD THE NIGHT BEFORE.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE 9 DEGREES. I THINK THE WATER WAS 30 DEGREES OR SOMETHING.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S INSANE. AND I'M GOING LIKE, THIS IS JUST NUTS. SO I GO IN AND I GO -- WHEW, WHEW -- I PUT ON -- I TOOK A SKI HAT OFF A KID. I DIDN'T CARE. [ LAUGHTER ] I PUT IT ON. I'M -- AH -- OOH -- AH! YOU KNOW? IT WAS ALMOST LIKE, I FELT LIKE A WRESTLING THING. I'M LIKE -- PEOPLE ARE LIKE, ROOTING ME ON. I AM GOING, "WHY AM I DOING THIS? THIS IS JUST AWFUL." I GO IN.

I JUST PLUNGE BACK.
Steve: RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND I WENT UNDER. I WENT UNDER, AND LIKE, A A COUPLE BUBBLES CAME OUT. AND -- I FROZE -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I WAS THINKING, "WELL, ONE OF THOSE EAR NOSE AND THROAT DOCTORS WILL COME GET ME. IF I'M REALLY DEAD, THEY'LL FISH ME OUT OF HERE." I JUST STAND UP AND I TOOK MY HAT OFF. AND MY HAIR IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO ICICLES. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL ICE. AND I HEARD BAGPIPES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: YOU THOUGHT WERE YOU IN HEAVEN?
Jimmy: WELL, I LOOKED AROUND. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE IRISH, THE FIRST THING YOU HEAR WHEN YOU DIE IS BAGPIPES. DID ANYONE ELSE HEAR THIS? AM I AND ANGEL? THIS IS HOW I WENT! ONE THING, I SAW, HERE'S RAHM EMANUEL. HERE IS THE MAYOR GETTING OUT, AFTER HE PLUNGED. THAT'S WHAT HE LOOKED WHEN HE CAME OUT. HERE'S A PICTURE OF ME WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE WATER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS ]
Steve: AT LEAST THE TEARS WARMED -- THE TEARS THAWED YOUR EYES.
Jimmy: YEAH, THE TEARS THAWED ME OUT. YEAH. I THOUGHT IT WAS IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE END. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. BUT WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER, IT WAS REALLY, REALLY COOL. THE MAYOR GAVE ME THIS -- HE PRESENTED ME WITH A A RESOLUTION HERE. AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY DID WAS -- THEY OFFICIALLY NAMED MARCH 2014 TO BE "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON" MONTH IN CHICAGO. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU TO MAYOR EMANUEL.

Jimmy: THEY KNOW THE MUPPETS?
THEY DO. 'CAUSE THE JASON SEGEL MOVIE WAS GREAT. THE ONE, JUST YEARS AGO. SO WHAT ARE THE MUPPETS UP TO THIS TIME?
"MUPPETS MOST WANTED" IS A A REALLY GOOD MOVIE. MUPPETS ARE ON A EUROPEAN TOUR BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BEING TRICKED BY AN EVIL FROG, AN EVIL RUSSIAN FROG NAMED CONSTANTINE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS KERMIT, AND THEY'RE KIND OF GETTING INVOLVED IN A JEWEL HEIST BUT THEY DON'T REALIZE IT.
Jimmy: HEY. NOW YOU PLAY, LIKE A RUSSIAN --

Jimmy: SAME AS WORKING ON AN AMERICAN MOVIE OR?
WELL, THE CREW WAS REALLY COOL. THE BRITISH CREW I REALLY LIKED. THEY REMINDED ME OF NEW YORK CREWS A LOT. THEY WERE FUNNY, AND REALLY EASY GOING. THE STUDIO WE SHOT AT WAS PINEWOODS STUDIOS. WHICH IS FAMOUS, IT'S WHERE THEY SHOT "GOLDFINGER" ALL THE EARLY JAMES BOND MOVIES. "CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG." "SUPERMAN." IT'S THE COOLEST OLD MOVIE STUDIO. THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE WITH THEIR MOVIE SETS IS, THERE'S NOT FOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] AMERICAN MOVIES SETS, THERE'S TONS OF FOOD.
Jimmy: LOTS OF FOOD.
YOU'RE NEVER MORE THAN THIS FAR AWAY FROM A FOOT-LONG PARTY SUB. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE BRITISH ARE JUST, THEY'RE NOT DISGUSTING LIKE US. SHOOT TEN HOURS AND THEN SOMEONE WOULD COME UP, WOULD YOU LIKE A LITTLE SWEETIE? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CAN I HAVE TWO, THREE SWEETIES?
AND THEN THEY GO AWAY FOR, LIKE, NINE MORE HOURS.
