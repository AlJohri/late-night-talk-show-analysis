[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE SHOW. THIS IS THE SHOW TO BE AT. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. I HOPE EVERYONE HAD A GOOD HALLOWEEN. YOU HAVE A GOOD HALLOWEEN? [ CHEERS ] IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WERE A LOT OF GOOD COSTUMES THIS YEAR. YOU HAD THE ROCK WENT AS POPEYE. DID YOU SEE THAT?
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT WAS COOL. HEIDI KLUM WENT AS JESSICA RABBIT. THAT WAS AMAZING. AND THIS YEAR'S METS WENT AS LAST YEAR'S METS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT'S GOOD.
Jimmy: GREAT COSTUMES.
Steve: SAVE A LOT OF MONEY.
Jimmy: WE WERE ALL -- [ LAUGHTER ] WE WERE ALL BUMMED HERE IN NEW YORK, BUT I DO WANT TO SAY CONGRATS TO THE KANSAS CITY ROYALS WHO BEAT THE METS TO WIN THEIR FIRST WORLD SERIES IN 30 YEARS LAST NIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A LONG TIME TO WAIT. SINCE THE ROYALS WON, THEY'LL GET TO MEET PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND SINCE THE METS BLEW AN EARLY LEAD AND LOST, THEY GET TO MEET JEB BUSH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, THE LOSS WAS A REAL HEARTBREAKER FOR THE METS, BUT I THINK FOX ANALYST FRANK THOMAS DID HIS BEST TO MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT THINGS. WATCH THIS.
THE METS HAVE NOTHING TO HOLD THEIR HEADS DOWN FOR, EXCEPT THEY DIDN'T PLAY THAT WELL AND THEY GAVE AWAY THE WORLD SERIES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEY SHOULD BE PROUD OF EVERYTHING THEY DID EXCEPT FOR EVERYTHING THEY DID.

HEY.
Jimmy: TEEN TALK.
TEEN TALK.
Jimmy: TEEN TALK, MAN. YOU START THERE, AND NOW HERE YOU ARE IN "TRUMBO." THIS THING IS GETTING CRAZY BUZZ. I DON'T WANT TO JINX ANYTHING, BUT YOU'RE IN THE MOVIE WITH JOHN GOODMAN, SO YOU'RE GUARANTEED AN OSCAR. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. JOHN GOODMAN'S MAGIC. A MAGICIAN, THE MAN TO BE IN MOVIES WITH. YOU WANT TO TELL EVERYBODY THE STORY OF THIS.
IT'S CALLED "TRUMBO." IT'S THE STORY OF A MAN, A A SCREEN WRITER IN 1947, HE WAS THE HIGHEST PAID SCREENWRITER IN HOLLYWOOD. HE WAS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTY. 'CAUSE IT WAS AN ADJUNCT OF LABOR UNIONS AND WANTED TO GET A VOICE IN WASHINGTON. AND AT THE RED SCARE DURING THE TIME, THE HOUSE ON AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE WOULD SUBPOENA AND SUMMONS THESE MEN AND WOMEN INTO THE COMMITTEE MEETING, AND IF THEY DIDN'T ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS THE WAY THEY WANTED TO, "ARE YOU NOW OR HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY," IF YOU REFUSE TO ANSWER ON THE BASIS OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT OR THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, PERHAPS, THEY WOULD SEND YOU TO JAIL. SO DALTON TRUMBO WENT TO JAIL FOR A YEAR BUT COMMITTED NO CRIME. SO THIS WAS AN INTERESTING THING. LIKE THE THOUGHT POLICE OF THE TIME, AND THE FEARMONGERS, AND IT WAS A REAL HONEST TO GOODNESS SCARE AT THAT TIME. AND THIS CLIP, I THINK, IS WHEN HE'S JUST COME OUT OF PRISON AND HE CAN'T WORK UNDER HIS OWN NAME, SO HE HAS TO USE A A PSEUDONYM. AND HE GOES TO JOHN GOODMAN, WHO IS A GUY NAMED FRANK KING, AND HE DOES SCHLOCK -- SCHLOCK MOVIES. DOESN'T MATTER. TO TRY TO GET A JOB USING AN ASSUMED NAME.
Jimmy: WE HAVE A CLIP. BRYAN CRANSTON IN "TRUMBO." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

Jimmy: OH YEAH.
PERSONAL PHYSIOLOGICAL INSULTS FOR ONE OF THE MODERATORS THERE. THEY HATED THE FOX NEWS ONE, THEY HATED THE CNN ONE. THEY SAID IT WAS TOO LONG AND TOO HOT. THE THIRD ONE THEY SAID THEY HATED THE PEOPLE. THEY LIKE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PROCESS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, SO IT'S LIKE --
Jimmy: IS IT TOUGH? BECAUSE THERE'S -- GOSH, I THINK THERE'S LIKE 3,000 CANDIDATES NOW, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT'S HARD TO MODERATOR A DEBATE WHEN THERE'S 15 CANDIDATES ON STAGE.
YES, I THINK THEY HAVE A A LEGITIMATE BEEF WITH THE DEBATES FEELING A LITTLE NUTTY. YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT THESE SEPARATE KID'S TABLE DEBATES WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T QUITE MAKE IT HAVE TO DO A A SEPARATE AREA.
Jimmy: YEAH.
LIKE THEY'RE IN DETENTION, OR SOMETHING. IT'S ALL VERY --
Jimmy: THEY'RE IN LITTLE SEATS AND THEY'RE AT A TINY TABLE.
I KNOW, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: C'MON MAN, I'M AN ADULT, YEAH.
THEY ONLY GET PLASTIC FORKS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EXACTLY.
BUT, I MEAN, IT ALL DOES BOIL DOWN TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S JUST TOO MANY OF THEM. AND SO, THERE'S NO EASY WAY TO DO ANYTHING. WE HAD RICK PERRY DROP OUT AND THEN WE HAD SCOTT WALKER DROP OUT. AND THEY'VE DROPPED OUT WITHIN TEN DAYS OF EACH OTHER. AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE PEOPLE DROPPING OUT. NOT A SINGLE ONE WILL LEAVE.
Jimmy: WELL DON'T YOU THINK SOMEONE --
THEY'RE ALL STAYING.
Jimmy: I WOULD BE OUT RIGHT NOW. BASICALLY, IT'S DOWN TO KIND OF THREE PEOPLE, OR TWO PEOPLE.
OR 15 PEOPLE, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, I GUESS SO.
I MEAN, PART OF THE DYNAMIC GOING ON IS SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T WINNING ARE LOOKING AROUND AT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WINNING AND THEY'RE LIKE, THAT GUY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M LOSING TO THIS PERSON.
I WOULD DROP OUT SINCE I HAVE BEEN AT 2% FOR THREE MONTHS, EXCEPT THAT GUY IS WINNING? NO WAY.
Jimmy: I'M GOING TO STICK THIS OUT. YEAH.
I MEAN, IF I WERE GIVING THEM ADVICE, I GUESS, I WOULD ADVISE ALL OF THEM TO STAY FOREVER. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE NONE OF THEM ARE GOING TO DROP OUT. THERE'S GOING TO BE A MILLION OF THEM IN THE DEBATES. THE DEBATES ARE ALL GOING TO BE A DISASTER FROM HERE ON OUT. IT'S GOING TO BE TOTAL CHAOS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN IT. THEY'RE ALL GOING TOP MUTINY, IT'S GOING TO BE SUPER FUN.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK IT'S THE BEST THING FOR OUR SHOW.
Jimmy: AND NOW, WHAT DO YOU DO, YOU'RE MODERATING SOMETHING DIFFERENT. IT'S NOT A DEBATE REALLY, RIGHT?
IT'S A FORUM.
Jimmy: YES. NOW, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT'S LIKE A DEBATE IN SLOW MOTION. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ONLY TWO HOURS, RIGHT?
YEAH. WELL, I DON'T GET ALL THE CANDIDATES ON STAGE AT ONCE. 'CAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN ONLY SANCTIONS SIX DEBATES. THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE. BUT I GET EACH OF THE CANDIDATES ON STAGE, IN FRONT OF LIKE AN AUDIENCE OF 3,000 PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I CAN ASK THEM WHATEVER I WANT. AND I HAVE THEM SORT OF AS MY CAPTIVES FOR TWO HOURS. IT'S GOING TO BE AWESOME.
Jimmy: ANYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO DO DIFFERENTLY AFTER SEEING WHAT THEY DID ON CNBC, ANYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE? WHY ARE YOU HAVING SLEEPLESS NIGHTS?
I'M MOTIVATED BY FEAR OF FAILURE. SO I IMAGINED, LAST NIGHT I DREAMT I WALKED UP ON THE STAGE AND THEN A LOT OF PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY THREW TOMATOES AT ME. AND I HAD TO DO THE WHOLE DEBATE COVERED IN TOMATO JUICE.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.
I KNOW, BUT THAT'S THE WAY MY MIND WORKS.
Jimmy: NO ONE'S GOING TO THROW A TOMATO. THEY DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.
NOW SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BECAUSE I SAID IT ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW."
Jimmy: OH, NO, NO, NO. DON'T DO THAT. IT WOULD BE SO UNCOUTH.
YEAH, I MEAN, I WANT TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THESE GUYS THAT I CAN. THE REPUBLICAN PROCESS IS CHAOTIC AND FASCINATING THIS YEAR. THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS MUCH SMALLER AND MUCH MORE STAID. BUT I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATS. SO I WANT TO GET THOSE, I WANT TO GET THOSE OUT AND I WANT TO FIND OUT HOW THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP OR WHOEVER THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IS GOING TO BE. I MEAN, NONE OF THE REPUBLICANS ARE HAVING GOOD LUCK BEATING BEN CARSON OR DONALD TRUMP. SO HOW DO THE DEMOCRATS THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BEAT THEM?
Jimmy: INTERESTING.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WELL, WE'LL BE ROOTING FOR YOU. I KNOW NO ONE WILL THROW A A TOMATO, YOU'RE FANTASTIC. RACHEL MADDOW, EVERYBODY.
