Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- STING KEVIN CONNOLLY SCIENCE EXPERT, KEVIN DELANEY AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 269, BATTLE CREEK!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY! WELCOME. LOOKING GOOD. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME EVERYONE TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, IT'S THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND THIS IS KIND OF A SURPRISE. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, THE RAPPER 50 CENT SAID THAT HE IS GOING TO BE SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON. YEAH. HILLARY WOULD BE EXCITED, BUT SHE DOESN'T GET OUT OF BED FOR LESS THAN A MILLION CENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I MEAN. ACTUALLY, HILLARY CLINTON HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF ENDORSEMENTS FROM RECORDING ARTISTS IN ADDITION TO 50 CENT. JA RULE AND SNOOP DOGG SAID THEY ARE SUPPORTING HILLARY. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, ALL THE GOP CANDIDATES ARE NOW TOURING AS THE WHO TANG CLAN. [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW THOSE GUYS. I KNOW THE FIRST FIVE GUYS. AND I SAW THAT THIS WEEK, HILLARY CLINTON JOINED THE NETWORKING SITE LINKEDIN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND YOU THOUGHT SHE WAS DELETING A LOT OF EMAILS BEFORE. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, GET READY. GET READY. 'CAUSE THIS IS -- OH MY GOSH. THAT'S RIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON JOINED LINKEDIN. OR AS LINKEDIN EXECUTIVES PUT IT, "HEY, LOOK, WE GOT ONE!" [ LAUGHTER ] JORDAN, GET IN HERE! WHAT DO WE DO? NO, SERIOUSLY, WHAT DO WE DO? WHAT DOES LINKEDIN DO? [ LAUGHTER ] AND NOW EVEN NEWT GINGRICH IS WEIGHING IN ON THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT. IN AN INTERVIEW THIS WEEK, NEWT GINGRICH CALLED PRESIDENT OBAMA "DANGEROUS" AND "INCOMPETENT" AND SUGGESTED THAT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE EVEN WORSE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE ONLY ONES WHO HEARD HIM WERE THE GOATS AT THE PETTING ZOO WHERE HE WORKS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT STILL, THEY AGREED WITH HIM.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: I SAW THAT SARAH PALIN WENT ON FACEBOOK TO ANNOUNCE THAT HER DAUGHTER BRISTOL'S WEDDING HAS BEEN CALLED OFF. THOUGH SHE SAID THE TWO FAMILIES WILL STILL GET TOGETHER ON THE WEDDING DAY TO "CELEBRATE LIFE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IN OTHER WORDS, THE CATERERS ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I MEAN YOU GOT TO DO -- YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW UP AND DO SOMETHING. SOME BIG TECH NEWS HERE. I READ THAT APPLE IS DEVELOPING A SERVICE CALLED HOMEKIT, THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO OPERATE GADGETS LIKE GARAGE OPENERS AND THERMOSTATS THROUGH ONE APP. YEAH. IN RELATED NEWS, PLEASE DON'T TELL MY PARENTS ABOUT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T. I CAN'T BE EXPLAINING EVERY WEEK. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, DAD -- DAD. HUH, WHAT? I PRESSED THAT. YEAH, I KNOW YOU PRESSED IT, DAD. IT'S 105 DEGREES IN HERE, JIM. [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW, YEAH, DAD. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT YOU DID WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ] PLAYBOY HAS A NEW APP THAT WILL OFFER "SAFE" CONTENT THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S OFFERED IN THE MAGAZINE. IT'S ALREADY BROKEN A RECORD -- LEAST DOWNLOADED APP OF ALL TIME. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I READ IT FOR THE ARTICLES. YOU GUYS, IT'S THE FRIDAY BEFORE A LONG WEEKEND, WHICH TYPICALLY MEANS IT'S THE PERFECT TIME TO DO WHAT'S CALLED A "NEWS DUMP." NOW, THAT'S WHEN A GOVERNMENT OR A COMPANY RELEASES SOME NEWS LATE FRIDAY IN HOPES THAT IT'S FORGOTTEN BY THE FOLLOWING WEEK. IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SWEEP THINGS UNDER THE RUG. SO I THOUGHT IT'D BE FUN IF WE DID OUR OWN PERSONAL NEWS DUMP RIGHT HERE ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW." TARIQ, DO YOU HAVE SOME NEWS YOU WANNA DUMP?
Tariq: I'D LOVE TO DUMP, JIMMY. [ LAUGHTER ] MY NEWS IS THAT I EXPENSED A A STEAK DINNER THAT I SAID WAS FOR WORK WHEN IT REALLY WASN'T.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. WELL, THAT'LL BE FORGOTTEN BY NEXT WEEK. KAMAL, YOU WANT TO DUMP SOME NEWS?
Kamal: JIMMY, MAN, I'VE BEEN NEEDIN' A DUMP ALL DAY! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MY NEWS IS THAT I DELETED A FEW EMAILS BETWEEN ME AND HILLARY THAT MIGHT HAVE INCRIMINATED BOTH OF US IN THE DEFLATEGATE SCANDAL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, I'M GLAD YOU CAME CLEAN, BUT PEOPLE PROBABLY WON'T REMEMBER THIS AFTER THE LONG WEEKEND. HOW ABOUT YOU, JAMES?
James: MY NEWS IS THAT FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS, I'VE BEEN SECRETLY LIVING AT THE AMERICAN GIRL DOLL STORE. [ LAUGHTER ] I SNEAK IN AFTER CLOSING TIME, PUT ON MY JAM JAMS, THEN HOST TEA PARTIES WITH ALL THE DOLLS. [ LAUGHTER ] EXCEPT FELICITY. THEN I GO TO SLEEP IN A LIFE SIZE DOLL HOUSE THAT'S AS SWEET AS GINGERBREAD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: JAMES, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FORGET ABOUT THAT BY NEXT WEEK. [ LAUGHTER ]
James: I DON'T WANT THEM TO FORGET. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHO COMBS A DOLL'S HAIR LIKE THAT? WHAT IS HE DOING? PSYCHO. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM? OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!
Steve: OH MY GOSH.
Jimmy: HEY, GUYS, I SAW THAT GATORADE CHOSE MICHAEL JORDAN TO NARRATE ITS NEWEST COMMERCIAL CALLED, "WE LOVE SWEAT." YEAH, "WE LOVE SWEAT." THEN 7-ELEVEN SAID, "GREAT, NOW WE'VE GOTTA GET A NEW SLOGAN FOR OUR HOT DOGS." [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO ENJOY THE WEEKEND. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS NEW GAME SHOW OVER ON ABC, IT'S CALLED "500 QUESTIONS." ANYONE SEE THIS? I LOVE GAME SHOWS. NOW, THEY ADVERTISED IT AS A A GAME SHOW WHERE A CONTESTANT WINS BY ANSWERING 500 QUESTIONS WITHOUT EVER MISSING THREE IN A A ROW. NOT COMPLICATED. THAT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH, RIGHT? STRAIGHT FORWARD?
THE MOMENT YOU GET THREE WRONG IN A ROW, YOU ARE GONE. THERE ARE 10 POSSIBLE ANSWERS. WE NEED YOU TO GIVE FIVE OF THEM IN 15 SECONDS. YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF THAT WRONG AND AVOID A SECOND WRONG. YOU HAVE TO GET HIM A SECOND WRONG IN THE NEXT QUESTION. YOU ARE UP TO $10,000. BUT NONE OF IT IS YOURS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MAKE THAT 501 QUESTIONS. WHAT IS THIS SHOW ABOUT? [ ENGLISH ACCENT ] YOU HAVE TO STAND WHILE SITTING DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT? THE IMPOSSIBLE SHOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS SHOW IS. NO ONE IS GOING TO WIN A A MILLION DOLLARS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS. FINALLY, I SAW THAT BEN & JERRY'S CO-FOUNDER, JERRY GREENFIELD, HAS COME OUT IN SUPPORT OF BERNIE SANDERS FOR PRESIDENT. AND EVEN SAID HE'D LOVE TO SCOOP ICE CREAM FOR HIM DURING HIS CAMPAIGN. YEAH. ACTUALLY, HE'S NOT THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT BEN & JERRY ARE GOING AFTER. THEY'VE RELEASED A WHOLE LINE OF NEW FLAVORS NAMED AFTER THE CANDIDATES, AND THEY'RE PRETTY INTERESTING. HERE'S A FEW. FIRST, THERE'S A FLAVOR BASED ON DONALD TRUMP CALLED "COCKY ROAD." [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT UP, THERE'S A FLAVOR BASED ON MARTIN O'MALLEY CALLED, "VANILLA. JUST VANILLA." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, THERE'S A FLAVOR BASED ON CHRIS CHRISTIE CALLED "I ATE IT ALREADY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S AN EMPTY CONTAINER. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, EVERYBODY! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HAPPY FRIDAY, EVERYBODY. SO I HAVE TWO LITTLE BABIES. YOU KNOW, I HAVE A ALMOST A A TWO-YEAR-OLD AND I HAVE A A SIX-MONTH-OLD. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT IS I WANT THEIR FIRST WORD TO BE "DADA." SECRETLY, THOUGH. I CAN'T SAY THAT TO MY WIFE. BUT YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I -- SO I WOULD CALL EVERYTHING "DADA." [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE IF I WAS GIVING HER A A BOTTLE, I WOULD GO, "YOU WANT DADA?" [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T CARE IF THE KID'S STUPID, I WANT HER TO SAY "DADA." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Steve: THEN YOU WIN. THEN YOU WIN.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. ANYWAYS, SO I TRIED EVERYTHING WITH DADA. AND THEN FINALLY SHE SAID HER FIRST WORD AND IT WAS "MAMA." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT I GO, THERE SHOULD BE A A BOOK OUT -- BECAUSE I ALWAYS READ BOOKS TO THE KIDS, AND THERE'S GREAT BOOKS OUT. BUT YOU READ THE SAME ONES ALL THE TIME. SO, ANYWAYS, I WROTE A BOOK AND YOU CAN TELL THAT I WROTE IT, BECAUSE THERE IS ONE WORD IN THE BOOK. IT'S "YOUR BABY'S FIRST WORD WILL BE 'DADA'." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S GOT FUN LITTLE CARTOON ANIMALS IN THERE. AND THAT'S ALL IT IS. IT'S JUST DIFFERENT DADAS TRYING -- NO. NOT THERE. NO. TRUST ME, THERE ARE ANIMALS IN HERE. SEE, THERE'S A BIG -- HE WANTS THE BABY TO SAY "DADA." AND THEN THE BABY SAYS, "BZZZ." HE DOESN'T SAY IT.
Steve: HE CAN'T SPEAK BECAUSE IT'S HIS BEE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: STOP, STOP, NOT THE POINT OF THE BOOK.
Steve: OH, IT'S A BOOK.
Jimmy: CHILD LIKE. IT'S FOR A BABY.
Steve: IT'S FOR BABIES. BABIES CAN'T READ. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT THE POINT, EITHER. I'M NOT TEACHING THE BABY -- EVENTUALLY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO READ "DADA" BECAUSE YOU POINT AT "DADA."
Steve: OH, OKAY.
Jimmy: BUT THEY THINK THAT ANIMALS TALK.
Steve: YEAH, SURE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THEN AT THE END ALL THE DADAS ARE THERE AND THEY WANT ALL THE BABIES TO SAY IT AND THEY SAY IT TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME AND EVERYONE SAYS "DADA."
Steve: AW. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: EXCEPT FOR THE DUCK. [ APPLAUSE ] THE DUCK SAYS QUACK. ANYWAYS. THE DUCK DOESN'T GET IT. HE'S A DUCK.
Steve: WHAT'S THAT?
Jimmy: THE DUCK DOESN'T GET IT. YOU MISSED THE END.
Steve: WHAT WAS THE END? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
