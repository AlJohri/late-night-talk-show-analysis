Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- SAVANNAH GUTHRIE AND MATT LAUER, FELICITY JONES, MUSICAL GUEST FKA TWIGS AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 155!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OH! BEAUTIFUL CROWD HERE IN NEW YORK! BEAUTIFUL NEW YORK CROWD! WELCOME, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYONE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HOPE YOU HAVE FUN TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, TODAY WERE THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. AND, WHILE WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE OFFICIAL RESULTS, THE "WASHINGTON POST" IS PREDICTING THAT THERE IS A 98% CHANCE OF THE REPUBLICANS TAKING THE SENATE. "NEW YORK TIMES" SAID THERE'S A A 75% CHANCE. AND CNN WAS LIKE, "WAIT, THAT WAS TODAY?" [ LAUGHTER ] OH BOY, I'M IN TROUBLE. EH BOY.
Steve: EH BOY.
Jimmy: I READ THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SPENT ELECTION DAY AWAY FROM ANY PRESS COVERAGE, ATTENDING CLOSED-DOOR MEETINGS INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, IT'S NICE TO SEE SOME DOORS ACTUALLY CLOSE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THE WHOLE NEW SECRET SERVICE, WHOLE SECURITY THING. DURING A SPEECH ON SUNDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID TO THE CROWD -- [ IMPERSONATING OBAMA ] "WE'VE GOT TO VOTE. VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE." [ LAUGHTER ]E WHICH WENT ON FOR AN HOUR UNTIL SOMEONE FINALLY FIXED THE TELEPROMPTER. HE'S LIKE -- [ IMPERSONATING OBAMA ] "VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE. VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE. VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE." THAT'S RIGHT. HE WAS QUOTED. THAT'S HIS QUOTE. YOU GOT TO VOTE. VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE. PERSONALLY, I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THAT MESSAGE IS IT'S NOT CATCHY ENOUGH. SO WE THOUGHT WE'D HELP OUT WITH THAT. TAKE A LOOK. ♪ 'CAUSE THE PLAYERS GONNA VOTE, VOTE, VOTE VOTE, VOTE ♪ ♪ AND THE HATERS GONNA VOTE, VOTE, VOTE VOTE, VOTE ♪ ♪ BABY, I'M JUST GONNA VOTE, VOTE, VOTE VOTE, VOTE ♪ ♪ SHAKE IT OFF SHAKE IT OFF ♪
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SEE THAT, THAT'S CATCHIER. HE SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT THE WHOLE TIME.
Steve: YEAH, COME ON, IT'S CATCHY.
Jimmy: BY THE WAY, THAT SONG IS NOT ON SPOTIFY. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] HEY, GUYS, DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE AND COLLEGE STUDENTS TO VOTE IN THE MIDTERMS. THOUGH, IF YOU WANT STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING, MAYBE DON'T CALL THEM MIDTERMS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING -- YEAH. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT. YOU GUYS KNOW MARIJUANA WAS A A BIG ISSUE IN THIS ELECTION WITH THE LEGALIZATION ON THE BALLOT IN SEVERAL STATES. BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN THAT QUESTIONS LIKE, DO YOU SUPPORT THE LEGALIZATION OF AUTHORIZED COMMERCIAL DISPENSARIES FOR THE MEDICAL AND RECREATIONAL USE OF MARIJUANA, MIGHT BE TOO CONFUSING TO PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY SMOKE MARIJUANA. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WOW. YOU JUST BLEW MY MIND. SO AS A RESULT, BALLOTS IN THOSE STATES ARE WORDING THE QUESTION IN WAYS THAT ARE EASIER FOR POT USERS TO UNDERSTAND.
Steve: OH, GOOD.
Jimmy: I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN. IN OREGON, THEY ASKED, "WOULD YOU EVER WRAP A BURRITO IN A A PIZZA?" [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? YOU GET WHERE WE'RE GOING, RIGHT?
Steve: YEAH. SO YES AND YES.
Jimmy: IN ALASKA THEY SAY, "HAVE YOU EVER PUT A SLAYER CASSETTE IN A TEDDY RUXPIN TO FREAK OUT YOUR LITTLE BROTHER?" IF YOU'VE DONE IT, YOU'D KNOW. YEAH. AND FINALLY, IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THEY ASK, "HAVE YOU EVER WORN CARGO SHORTS TO A FUNERAL?" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND YOU KNOW, BASED ON THAT, YOU'LL GET THE RIGHT ANSWER.
Steve: THEY CAN EXTRAPOLATE.
Jimmy: SORRY ABOUT -- SORRY ABOUT YOUR LOSS, BRO. [ LAUGHTER ] CHECK THIS OUT, GUYS. SOME RESEARCHERS IN THE UK HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE SONG "WANNABE" BY THE SPICE GIRLS IS THE CATCHIEST POP SONG, AFTER MOST PEOPLE COULD IDENTIFY THE TUNE IN JUST 2.3 SECONDS. OR JUST LONG ENOUGH TO SAY, "TURN IT OFF." [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT THIS WAS INTERESTING. ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY, BABIES HEAR THREE TIMES AS MANY WORDS FROM THEIR MOTHERS THAN THEY DO FROM THEIR FATHERS. THREE TIMES, YEAH. MY WIFE HEARD THAT. MY WIFE WAS LIKE, "THAT'S SO FASCINATING." I WAS LIKE, "COOL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] A WEIRD STORY HERE. I READ ABOUT A MAN WHO PAID $50,000 TO BUY THE NAMING RIGHTS FOR A BABY GIRAFFE BORN LAST WEEK AT THE DALLAS ZOO. YOU CAN TELL THE GUY'S GOING THROUGH SOMETHING WHEN HE NAMED THE GIRAFFE "IF I CAN'T HAVE THIS MONEY, SHE CAN'T HAVE THIS MONEY." [ AUDIENCE OHS ] YOU COULD HAVE BOUGHT ANYTHING. NOPE.
Steve: NOPE.
Jimmy: I DON'T CARE.
Steve: YOU WANT HALF OF THAT?
Jimmy: I DON'T EVEN WANT A A GIRAFFE. I JUST WANT TO NAME THE GIRAFFE. I DON'T EVEN CARE. I DON'T WANT IT.
Steve: WHAT WAS IT, $1?
Jimmy: $50,000. FINALLY, THIS MADE ME LAUGH. LAST WEEK THIS GUY IN ALABAMA WAS ARRESTED FOR ROBBING FOUR SUBWAY SANDWICH SHOPS. INVESTIGATORS ASKED HIM WHY HE DID IT. AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HE SAID.
HE STATED IN THE COURSE OF HIS INTERVIEW THAT HE HAD TRIED THE JARED DIET. IT HADN'T WORKED FOR HIM LIKE HE THOUGHT IT SHOULD HAVE. AND HE WAS TRYING TO GET HIS MONEY BACK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT MAKES SENSE. [ APPLAUSE ] THE JARED DIET DIDN'T WORK SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO GET MY MONEY BACK. SUBWAY CREDITS HIS CAPTURE TO THE HARD WORK OF THE POLICE INVESTIGATORS. I'M SORRY. I MEAN ARREST ARTISTS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THE GOOD NEWS IS, WHERE THIS GUY'S GOING, HE WON'T HAVE TO PAY $5 FOR A FOOT LONG.
Steve: WHOA, HEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: YOU KNOW OUR NEXT GUEST FROM HER ROLES IN "LIKE CRAZY" AND "THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2." BEGINNING THIS FRIDAY -- OH, YOU'VE GOT TO SEE HER IN THIS MOVIE -- "THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING." LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME, FELICITY JONES! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
HOW ARE YOU DOING? I LOVE THAT!
Jimmy: I'M ALL ABOUT THAT BASS. FELICITY JONES! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FELICITY, WELCOME.
HI.
Jimmy: GOOD TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS. YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: I LOVE YOUR ACCENT.
OH, YEAH, I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR HOURS.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE FROM ENGLAND. IT'S SO FUN.
VERY GOOD, ISN'T IT?
Jimmy: YEAH. HOW LONG ARE YOU IN THE STATES FOR? ARE YOU HERE FOR A WHILE?
I JUST ACTUALLY RECENTLY MOVED TO NEW YORK. SO, I'M SETTING UP MY HOME HERE.
Jimmy: YOU AND TAYLOR SWIFT ARE NEW YORKERS?
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DO YOU GET BACK TO ENGLAND MUCH TO SEE YOUR PARENTS?
I DO. I SPEAK TO THEM EVERY DAY. I SPEAK TO MY MOM EVERY DAY. I'M ALWAYS ON SKYPE. SKYPE KEEPS MY LIFE GOING, COMMUNICATING WITH FRIENDS.
Jimmy: I CAN'T CONVINCE MY PARENTS TO UNDERSTAND SKYPE.
IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG, SLOW PROCESS. SHE'S GETTING USED TO IT NOW.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE THERE'S A A CAMERA UP MY DAD'S NOSE GOING, "WHAT, HUH? I CAN HEAR YOU, BUT I CAN'T SEE YOU." I'M LIKE, OH, FORGET IT.
YOU'RE LIKE PUT IT DOWN. PUT THE CAMERA DOWN.
Jimmy: I GUESS I'LL CALL YOU ON THE PHONE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT PHONE? I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN PHONES TO THOSE GUYS. BUT THEN THERE WAS A LITTLE KIND OF A FAMILY SCARE, NOT REALLY SCARE --
WELL, A SCARE, A SCARE OF SORTS, DEFINITELY. SO, I WAS SHOOTING A FILM CALLED "TRUE STORY" LAST YEAR ACTUALLY IN NEW YORK IN UPTOWN, IN MANHATTAN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND WE WERE DOING A SCENE, IT WAS JONAH HILL AND I. WE PLAY A COUPLE IN IT. AND WE'RE COMING OUT OF A BOOK SHOP. MY CHARACTER TOWARDS THE END OF THE FILM, SHE'S VERY HEAVILY PREGNANT. YOU KNOW, SHE'S ABOUT TO POP.
Jimmy: YEAH.
WITH THIS HUGE BELLY BUTTON AS WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY NOTICEABLE. THERE'S SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS TAKING PICTURES DURING A SCENE.
Jimmy: PAPARAZZI OR WHATEVER.
YEAH. THE PAPS.
Jimmy: THAT'S A COOLER NAME, YEAH.
YEAH, I LOVE THAT, THE PAPS. I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SORT OF FOCUSED ON DOING THE SCENE AND GETTING INTO THE CAB. AND THEN, THE NEXT DAY THE PHOTOGRAPHS APPEARED IN THE PAPER IN ENGLAND. AND I STARTED GETTING ALL THESE PICTURES FROM MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY, BEING LIKE, WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU DIDN'T TELL US? I WAS LIKE, NO, I'M NOT PREGNANT. NO, IT'S A MOVIE. IT'S THE MOVIE.
Jimmy: HOW COULD THEY BELIEVE THAT YOU HID THIS SECRET FOR THEM FOR EIGHT MONTHS?
EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE? UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY READY TO POP THERE.
YEAH. THEY WERE LIKE, ARE YOU HAVING JONAH HILL'S BABY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE OTHER THING. HEY, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU. I'M HAVING JONAH HILL'S BABY.
I HAD, LIKE, GREAT AUNTS BRINGING UP BEING MARRIED -- YEAH. WHAT'S GOING ON? IS THERE SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US? THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE IN NEW YORK.
Jimmy: WE'RE DOING A LITTLE RESEARCH ON YOU. I SAW ONE OF YOUR FIRST PAYING JOBS, YOU WERE ON A -- LIKE A -- IT WAS LIKE A WITCH SHOW.
YEAH. CALLED THE "WORST WITCH."
Jimmy: YEAH, THE "WORST WITCH." AND WHAT WAS THIS ABOUT? IT ONLY AIRED IN ENGLAND.
IT WAS ONLY IN ENGLAND. IT WAS A BIT LIKE "HARRY POTTER" BUT WITHOUT THE BOYS. JUST THE GIRLS.
Jimmy: IT MUST BE FUN PLAYING A WITCH. I MEAN, HOW OLD WERE YOU THEN?
SO, I WAS 13. AND IT WAS A SCHOOL FOR WITCHES WHERE THEY GO AND LEARN HOW TO DO SPELLS AND RIDE ON BROOM STICKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: DID YOU GET YOUR OWN BROOM?
YEAH, AND YOU GET YOUR OWN CAT.
Jimmy: THAT'S FUN.
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IS REALLY EXCITING. AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ACTING WITH THEM AND MAKING IT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE YOUR BEST FRIEND. YOU KNOW, THIS LITTLE CAT. BUT IT'S SORT OF SPITTING AT YOU AND HISSING. AND YOU'RE LIKE TRYING TO STROKE THIS CAT AND GIVE IT LOTS OF LOVE.
Jimmy: SPITTING AND HISSING?
YEAH, THEY WERE REALLY UNHAPPY CATS.
Jimmy: THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE ACTING CATS. THEY WERE UNHAPPY IN GENERAL, THOUGH.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: GET PUPPIES NEXT TIME.
DON'T MAKE ME BE AN ACTOR.
Jimmy: BUT THE EFFECTS WERE GREAT. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS.
I MEAN, SUPERB.
Jimmy: I MEAN, PHENOMENAL. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP OF YOU.
OH, GOD, NO.
Jimmy: FROM "THE WORST WITCH." HERE'S FELICITY JONES. SEE IF YOU CAN TELL WHAT'S REAL, WHAT'S NOT.
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO AGE IT. IT'S REALLY EASY WHEN YOU KNOW HOW. I JUST ORDER IT TO HOVER.
AH! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE IN THE BACK OF A PICK UP TRUCK. GOOD ACTING.
YOU CAN'T SEE THAT THERE'S JUST A GUY KIND OF PUSHING ME ALONG BEHIND.
Jimmy: YOU WERE IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP TRUCK IN FRONT OF A A GREEN SCREEN. AT THE TIME, IT WAS REALLY GOOD.
IT WAS VERY ADVANCED. THIS IS TOP OF THE LINE.
Jimmy: WELL, LOOK WHERE YOU ARE NOW. NOW, YOU'VE COME TO THIS. YOU'RE IN "THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING." YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FILM, GUYS. IT'S BASED ON, YOU KNOW, JANE AND STEPHEN HAWKING AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP. AND JUST HOW HE GOT DIAGNOSED. AND JUST WHAT HE'S GONE THROUGH.
EXACTLY. IT'S A LOVE STORY IN MANY WAYS. IT'S ABOUT JANE AND STEPHEN, STEPHEN'S FIRST WIFE.
Jimmy: WERE THEY THERE?
YES, THEY WERE THERE. IT WAS SUCH A BIZARRE DAY. OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE REAL PEOPLE. AND WE WERE PLAYING THEM. AND IT WAS A DAY WHEN EDDIE REDMAYNE AND I WERE ON THE SET. JANE AND STEPHEN WERE ON EITHER SIDE OF US AS WE WERE SHOOTING A SCENE. IT WAS THE MOST SURREAL MOMENT HAVING THE REAL PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE PLAYING WATCHING YOU. IT'S REALLY NERVE-RACKING.
Jimmy: IT'S GOT TO BE WEIRD FOR THEM AS WELL WATCHING PEOPLE PLAY THEM. WE'RE US WE COULD JUST PLAY US.
ABSOLUTELY. THERE WAS A SURREAL MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE WATCHING ONE OF THE SCENES WE'D DONE BACK. IT WAS VERY BIZARRE SEEING THEM WATCHING US. IT WAS ALL VERY --
Jimmy: NO, WE DIDN'T DO IT THAT WAY. WE DID IT THIS WAY.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: IT'S BASED ON THEIR MEMOIRS. SO, IT'S REAL. I MEAN, THEY WERE THERE. IT'S VERY INVOLVED.
EXACTLY. IT'S BASED ON JANE HAWKING'S MEMOIRS, HIS WIFE, ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP.
Jimmy: AMAING PERFORMANCE. AMAZING, BOTH OF YOU GUYS. THE WHOLE MOVIE. GETTING A LOT OF BUZZ AND IT SHOULD BECAUSE IT'S FANTASTIC. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S FELICITY JONES AND EDDIE REDMAYNE IN "THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING."
LEAVE ME NOW.
ARE YOU GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS ALL NIGHT?
WILL YOU JUST GO?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
YES, IT IS WHAT I WANT. IF YOU CARE ABOUT ME AT ALL, PLEASE, JUST GO.
I CAN'T.
I HAVE TEN YEARS TO LIVE. I NEED TO WORK.
I LOVE YOU.
THAT'S A FALSE CONCLUSION.
I WANT TO BE TOGETHER FOR AS LONG AS WE'VE GOT. IF IT'S NOT VERY LONG, WELL THEN THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS. IT WILL HAVE TO DO.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COMING. IT WILL AFFECT EVERYTHING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
