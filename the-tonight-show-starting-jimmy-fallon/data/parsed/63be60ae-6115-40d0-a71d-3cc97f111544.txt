HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. OUR PAL, OUR FRIEND, THE FORMER CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY WIENER IS BACK IN THE NEWS. I HEARD THAT HE'S OPENING A NEW RESTAURANT THAT WILL SPECIALIZE IN HEALTHY, LOCAL FOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE SAY THE FOOD IS FINE, BUT THE PORTIONS LOOK MUCH BIGGER IN THE PHOTO. [ LAUGHTER ] SO ANTHONY WIENER IS OPENING A A NEW RESTAURANT. IN FACT, IT'S THE FIRST RESTAURANT WITH A SIGN ON THE DOOR THAT SAYS, NO SHOES, NO SHIRT, NO PANTS, NO UNDERWEAR, NO HATS -- IT'S A LONG LIST.
Steve: WOW!
Jimmy: A LONG LIST, YEAH.
Steve: REALLY.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, IT WILL SPECIALIZE IN LOCAL FOOD. WHEN PEOPLE HEARD ABOUT THAT, THEY WERE LIKE, "IF I WANT LOCAL WIENER, I'LL STICK TO CRAIGSLIST." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.
Steve: LOCAL FOOD.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, ANY GOOD RESTAURANT HAS TO HAVE A GOOD NAME. SO WE THOUGHT WE'D HELP WIENER THINK OF ONE. HERE ARE SOME OPTIONS. FIRST THERE'S P.F. WANG'S. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: WE'RE HELPING. WE'RE TRYING TO HELP.
Steve: WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THEM.
Jimmy: WE'RE JUST TRYING TO HELP THEM.
Steve: COME ON, IT'S LOCAL.
Jimmy: I SAW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA KICKED OFF HIS STAY AT MARTHA'S VINEYARD WHERE HE'LL BE ON VACATION FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, IT'S TIME FOR "PRESIDENT OBAMA, VACATION OBAMA." ♪ PRESIDENT OBAMA VACATION OBAMA PRESIDENT OBAMA VACATION OBAMA ♪ ♪ PRESIDENT PRESIDENT VACATION VACATION PRESIDENT VACATION VACATION VACATION ♪ ♪ COWBOY OBAMA HARD HAT OBAMA BA-ROBERT DeNIRO-BAMA ♪ ♪ BARACK O-BASEBALL OBAMA ♪
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE NUMBER ONE SONG IN THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.
Steve: IS IT REALLY?
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. DID YOU SEE THIS? LAST WEEK THE WHITE HOUSE WAS BRIEFLY LOCKED DOWN AFTER A A TODDLER SQUEEZED THROUGH THE FENCE ON THE NORTH LAWN. AND THIS IS REALLY CUTE. THIS IS REAL. THE ACTUAL STATEMENT FROM THE SECRET SERVICE. DID YOU SEE THIS? THEY SAID, "WE WERE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL HE LEARNED TO TALK TO QUESTION HIM. BUT IN LIEU OF THAT HE GOT A A TIME-OUT AND WAS SENT ON HIS WAY WITH HIS PARENTS." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS REALLY CUTE OF THEM TO DO THAT. BUT ANYWAY, TODAY, THE BABY RELEASED ITS OWN STATEMENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: IT SAID, "IT'S THIS TYPE OF DISMISSAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HAVE SOURED OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY LIKE A BOTTLE OF MILK THAT GOT LEFT OUT OVERNIGHT. WHILE I MAY HAVE APPROACHED SPEAKING WITH THE PRESIDENT IN THE WRONG WAY, I BELIEVE DEEP DOWN IN MY DIAPER, THAT WE CANNOT GET THIS COUNTRY BACK ON TRACK UNTIL OBAMA STOPS PLAYING GOLF AND STARTS PLAYING A A STIRRING GAME PATTYCAKE WITH WORLD LEADERS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOME SPORTS NEWS OVER THE WEEKEND. THE ANGELS BEAT THE RED SOX IN THE LONGEST MAJOR LEAGUE -- [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] WELL, IT HAPPENED.

Jimmy: THAT'S TRUE. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S TRUE. SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS. IN A NEW INTERVIEW HILLARY CLINTON CRITICIZED PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHO'S BEEN USING THE PHRASE "DON'T DO STUPID STUFF" TO DESCRIBE HIS FOREIGN POLICY DOCTRINE. SHE SAID THE PHRASE LACKS DEPTH. BUT IN THE WHITE HOUSE'S DEFENSE IT'S A MUCH BETTER SLOGAN THAN THE OTHER ONE THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERING. THERE WAS "BAD THINGS, THEY'RE NOT GOOD SO DON'T DO 'EM. WAIT, WHAT?" [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THERE WAS "IF THE COUNTRY STARTS WITH A LETTER 'R' OR 'N', IT'S BAD." WAIT, NO. THAT'S TOO SIMPLE, THAT ONE.
Steve: YEAH. AND FINALLY, THERE WAS "W.W.B.D.D.T.O. WHAT WOULD BIDEN DO? DO THE OPPOSITE." [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN SEE WHY THEY DIDN'T GO WITH THOSE ONES AND THEY WENT WITH THE ONE THEY HAVE NOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS COOL. I SAW THAT TV LAND JUST LAUNCHED A NEW VERSION OF THE CLASSIC SHOW "CANDID CAMERA." OR AS MOST YOUNG PEOPLE PUT IT, "I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY RIPPED OFF 'PUNK'D.'" [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, THINGS ARE GETTING OUT OF CONTROL IN TIMES SQUARE. THEY REALLY ARE. IT'S JUST NUTS. JUST THIS WEEKEND POLICE JUST ARRESTED TWO GUYS DRESSED LIKE IRON MAN, ONE GUY DRESSED LIKE ELMO AND ANOTHER GUY DRESSED LIKE SPIDERMAN FOR DISORDERLY CONDUCT. THE PARENTS IN TIMES SQUARE ARE LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST BRING BACK THE HOOKERS. THEY WERE SO MUCH EASIER -- SO MUCH EASIER TO DEAL WITH." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, YOU GUYS.
