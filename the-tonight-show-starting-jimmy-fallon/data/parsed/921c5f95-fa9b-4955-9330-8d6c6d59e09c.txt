I'VE NEVER BEEN ON THE SHOW "LAW AND ORDER." NBC'S OWN, "LAW AND ORDER." THAT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU PEOPLE, BUT GUESS WHAT, IF YOU'VE EVEN BEEN, IF YOU CAME HERE THREE MONTHS AGO FROM IOWA TO BE AN ACTOR AND YOU'VE BEEN ON "LAW AND ORDER." I'VE NEVER BEEN ON, AND I'VE WALKED ACCIDENTALLY ON THE SET OF "LAW AND ORDER" AT LEAST SEVEN TIMES DURING THE COURSE OF MY LIFE. AND NOT TO BE A DICK ABOUT IT, BUT EVERY TIME I'VE WALKED ON I'VE BEEN THE MOST FAMOUS PERSON I SEE THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] STOP, I GET IT. JEFF GOLDBLUM. COLIN QUINN. THE POINT IS THIS. AND EVERY TIME, IT'S LIKE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, LIKE, HEY, HOW IS THE SHOW GOING? ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU LATER, MARISKA -- I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S MY POINT, FOLKS. MY POINT IS, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE LEAD COPS ON "LAW AND ORDER." BECAUSE EVERY "LAW AND ORDER" IS WHY, IT'S ANNOYING, BECAUSE EVERY COP SHOW, THEY'RE HOMICIDE DETECTIVES, THERE'S BEEN A MURDER, AND THEN THEY GO INTO SHOCK. THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO COME IN AND TELL YOU. IT'S NOT A CON ED, THERE'S BEEN A MURDER AT CON ED, THEN YOU GO INTO SHOCK. YOU'RE WAITING. THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING. SO, BUT I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE LEAD COPS FOR LIKE 11 YEARS ON "LAW AND ORDER." IT'S STUPID I HAVEN'T. I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN A GUEST MURDERER ON AN EPISODE OF "LAW AND ORDER." I'M JUST A LEVEL OF FAME YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE ON "LAW AND ORDER," YOU KNOW. WHERE I'M FAMOUS BUT NOBODY CARES. LIKE, IF PEOPLE SEE ME IN THE STREETS ALL OF THE TIME, THEY'RE LIKE "COLIN QUINN, DO ME A FAVOR, GRAB THOSE JUMPER CABLES IN MY CAR." [ LAUGHTER ] I SWEAR TO GOD. [ APPLAUSE ] BUT YOU SEE ME LIKE, THE GUEST MURDERER, YOU HAVE TWO, LIKE SEMI CELEBS, SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IS -- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE IF IT'S ONE, THAT'S A A MURDERER. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SO LIKE THE FIRST HALF YOU THINK IT'S WHOEVER ELSE, MEGAN MULLALLY, I DON'T KNOW, SOMEBODY ELSE YOU WOULD THINK WAS ON "HOLLYWOOD GAME NIGHT." AND FIRST HALF, SHE'S THE KILLER, ALL ROADS LEAD TO MEGAN MULLALLY, BUT THEN THE COPS COME, THEY'RE TALKING TO HER, YOU THINK SHE'S THE KILLER AND THEN I COME IN FROM NEXT DOOR. I'M NOT EVEN A SUSPECT, I'M JUST COMING IN. I WORK, WE HAVE ADJOINING STORES, I WORK AT THE FLORISTS, COMING FOR SINGLES FOR MY STORE. IT'S RETAIL. YOU NEED SINGLES, IT'S WORK, RIGHT? AND I'M LIKE STARTLED THE COPS ARE EVEN THERE. AND OH, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU HAD COMPANY, MARGARETE. WHATEVER HER NAME IS. I'LL COME BACK LATER. NICE TO MEET YOU, OFFICER. AND THEN NOW I'M KIND OF FLAGGED, LIKE, HEY THAT GUY MIGHT BE THE MURDERER, YOU KNOW. BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE. AND THEN THE NEXT SCENE, THERE IS SOME SPECIAL COP SOIL OR SOME PETALS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT ONLY SOMEBODY IN THE FLORIST INDUSTRY WOULD -- [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST, YOU DON'T JUST BUY STUFF LIKE THAT. SO THEN, AND NOW YOU'RE SITTING HOME, ALL THE GUYS ARE LIKE, HEY, HONEY, I THINK HE MIGHT BE THE KILLER, THE GUY FROM THE FLORIST. OH, YOU WOULD BE A GREAT DETECTIVE, YOU'RE SO SMART. [ LAUGHTER ] THE GUY IS LIKE, OH, SHE GETS ME. AND -- [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEN WE LIKE TO THINK WE'RE GOOD AT THAT. YOU WANT TO GO -- MMA GUY. AND FINALLY, THE LAST SCENE, YOU REALIZE I AM THE KILLER, IN FACT. THEY COME TO MY HOUSE TO ARREST ME, WALK IN, BUT EVEN THE HOUSE IS COVERED IN LIKE FLORA AND FAUNA, LIKE THERE IS PLANT LIFE ALL OVER. LIKE THIS GUY IS SUCH A CREEP. YOU THINK IF YOU WORK IN THE FLOWER INDUSTRY, THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO SEE WHEN YOU GO HOME IS A BUNCH OF FLOWERS, RIGHT? THIS GUY EVEN ON HIS FREE TIME HE'S INTO LIKE, BUT HE DOES IT OUT OF LOVE, IT'S LIKE A SEXUAL CONNECTION. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN THEY COME IN THE BACK, THEY WALK THEIR WAY, THROUGH HIM IN THE BACK THROUGH MY PRUNING SHEARS AND GARDENING GLOVES. I GIVE A BIG SPEECH, IT'S ABOUT GARDENING BUT REALLY ABOUT HOW I KILLED A GIRL, IT'S LIKE A A METAPHOR. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE FLIPPING -- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN LILACS BLOOM, DETECTIVE? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW THEY'RE VERY DELICATE. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, THEY'RE ACTUALLY LOYAL, UNLESS YOU DON'T SHOW THEM LOVE BACK AND THEN THEY'LL TURN ON YOU. THEY'RE RATHER LIKE PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH. THANKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: HEY! COLIN QUINN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STICK AROUND, YOU GUYS. COLIN QUINN WHEN WE COME BACK. COME ON BACK, EVERYBODY, PLEASE. HAVE A SEAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: YEAH.
SHE GOT FAMOUS IN HER EARLY 20s AND SHE DIDN'T CHANGE. SHE STILL LIKE GOT A GOOD ENERGY. I WORK WITH SO MANY PEOPLE ON SHOWS OVER THE YEARS. EARLY 20s, THEY COME IN THE SHOW, THEY'RE LIKE, "HEY, I'M THE YOUNGEST PERSON ON THE SHOW." IT'S LIKE, "WHO CARES?" AND THEY'VE GET LIKE AN ATTITUDE, BUT THEY'RE LIKE, "OH, GEE, SO EXCITED TO BE HERE." YOU KNOW THE TYPE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT GOING TO NAME NAMES. I'M JUST SAYING OVER THE YEARS. I'VE WORKED ON SHOWS, PEOPLE IN THEIR EARLY 20s. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: OH MY GOD.
THIS IS THE PICTURE SHE SENT ME, I SWEAR TO GOD, THE DAY MY BOOK CAME OUT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WAIT A MINUTE. JUST THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF PERSON, AS BUSY AS SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH HER CAREER, TOOK THE TIME TO BUY MY BOOK -- I DIDN'T SEND HER A BOOK. TOOK THE TIME TO BUY IT, TOOK THE TIME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DOORS HAD TO GO TO - - AND THEN SHE STUFFED THE BOOK UNDER AND THEN TOOK THE PICTURE. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S AMY SCHUMER. WE ALL LOVE AMY.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHY WE HAVE -- THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BOOK JACKETS
