Questlove: 464, ILLINOIS!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I FEEL THE LOVE. HOT CROWD TONIGHT. HOT CROWD HERE. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. YOU MADE IT, YOU'RE HERE, THIS IS IT, YOU'RE PART OF THE SHOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. HAVE A GOOD TIME. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN TONIGHT.
YOU'RE A HANDSOME MAN, JIMMY.
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR. I APPRECIATE IT. YOU'RE A HANDSOME MAN, JIMMY. HE YELLED IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: NEVER HEARD THAT YELLED FROM THE CROWD.
Jimmy: I PAID HIM, I PAID HIM MONEY TO YELL THAT ACTUALLY.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. AFTER LAST NIGHT'S INDIANA PRIMARY, IT'S STARTING TO LOOK LIKE WE FINALLY HAVE OUR TWO CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S DOWN TO "UH-OH" VERSUS "I GUESS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, AFTER WINNING THE INDIANA PRIMARY, DONALD TRUMP IS NOW SET TO BECOME THE FIRST MAJOR PARTY NOMINEE WITHOUT POLITICAL EXPERIENCE SINCE DWIGHT EISENHOWER, WHO WAS A A FIVE-STAR GENERAL DURING WORLD WAR II. WHEN TRUMP HEARD THAT, HE WAS LIKE, "BIG DEAL, I'M GOING TO BE PRESIDENT FOR WORLD WAR III. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO IT'S LIKE MUCH BIGGER." NO. THAT'S NOT -- NO. NOW TRUMP IS THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, AND HE HAD A BIG MESSAGE FOR AMERICA LAST NIGHT. LISTEN TO THIS.
WE LOSE WITH OUR MILITARY, WE CAN'T BEAT ISIS. WE LOSE WITH TRADE. WE LOSE WITH BORDERS. WE LOSE WITH EVERYTHING. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE. WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN, AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN BIGLY. [ APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: BIGLY?
Jimmy: CHRIS CHRISTIE GOT EXCITED BECAUSE "WIN BIGLY" WAS HIS CAMPAIGN SLOGAN.
Steve: ARE YOU SERIOUS? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WIN BIGLY.
Steve: WIN BIGLY.
Jimmy: WIN BIGLY. OF COURSE, THE OTHER BIG STORY IS THAT TED CRUZ DROPPED OUT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE LAST NIGHT, JUST A WEEK AFTER -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ] JUST A WEEK AFTER ANNOUNCING CARLY FIORINA AS HIS RUNNING MATE. CARLY SAID SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS OVER, BUT STILL EXCITED TO LAY OFF THE CAMPAIGN STAFF. SO I MEAN, SHE'S LIKE -- THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STILL GOT IT. TED CRUZ GAVE A BIG SPEECH LAST NIGHT WITH HIS WIFE HEIDI BY HIS SIDE. IT WAS A ROUGH AND OFTEN AWKWARD CAMPAIGN FOR THEM AND IT HAD A FITTING ENDING. CHECK OUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER CRUZ FINISHED GIVING HIS SPEECH. WATCH.
FOR THE PRESIDENCY RIGHT NOW --
Jimmy: WAIT. WAIT. OH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] PROOF THAT HE REALLY IS THE ZODIAC HUGGER.
Steve: WHAT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: CAN'T STOP -- [ GRUNTING ]
Steve: TAKE ME ON. I'LL HUG YOU. BUT FIRST I'LL HIT YOU IN THE FACE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE A HANDSOME MAN, JIMMY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE A HANDSOME MAN. BUT CRUZ ISN'T THE ONLY ONE DROPPING OUT. TODAY, JOHN KASICH ALSO SUSPENDED HIS CAMPAIGN LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER TED CRUZ. WHEN ASKED WHY HE WAITED THIS LONG, KASICH SAID, "SO AT LEAST I COULD SAY I GOT SECOND PLACE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN, THAT'S NOT BAD. NOT THAT BAD, RIGHT?" THIS IS PRETTY COOL. VIRGIN AMERICA ANNOUNCED THAT IT'S TEAMING UP WITH THE "ROCK THE VOTE" CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE PASSENGERS TO REGISTER TO VOTE WHILE IN THE AIR. WHILE MOST PEOPLE SEE THE CANDIDATES AND JUST SAY, "ANY WAY WE CAN JUST STAY UP HERE AND JUST KEEP CIRCLING? CIRCLE FOR FOUR YEARS?" [ APPLAUSE ] OOH, A LITTLE CELEBRITY GOSSIP, HERE. "PAGE SIX" REPORTS THAT REGIS PHILBIN HAS BEEN APPROACHED TO RETURN AS KELLY RIPA'S CO-HOST ON "LIVE!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, HE MIGHT SAY NO. OR AS BERNIE SANDERS PUT IT, "LOOKS LIKE I FOUND MY PLAN B, BABY! HERE WE GO. [ APPLAUSE ] WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE NEWS TODAY?" [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. RADIOHEAD JUST RELEASED ITS NEW SINGLE, WHICH IS CALLED "BURN THE WITCH." THEN IMMEDIATELY TOLD REPUBLICANS, "NO, YOU CANNOT USE IT IN ATTACK ADS." NO, THAT IS NOT -- NO, NO, NO. [ APPLAUSE ] HEY, GUYS, A LITTLE REMINDER OF COURSE. SUNDAY IS MOTHER'S DAY. AND I READ THAT MOTHER'S DAY THEMED PRO-MARIJUANA BILLBOARDS ARE POPPING UP IN ARIZONA. [ CHEERS ] YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE WORKING WHEN MOTHER'S DAY BRUNCH LASTS SEVEN HOURS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU EVER NOTICE THAT MOM UPSIDE DOWN IS WOW? [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU HAVE ANY HOT POCKETS? [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS INTERESTING, HERE. APPARENTLY A SCIENTIST IN POLAND RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT INSECTS ACTUALLY HAVE DISTINCT PERSONALITIES. BUT KEEP IN MIND, THAT'S ACCORDING TO A SCIENTIST WHO SPENDS ALL DAY WITH INSECTS. [ LAUGHTER ] "OH, BARBARA'S IN A BAD MOOD TODAY." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, I READ THAT NEARLY 150 PEOPLE ON A DISNEY CRUISE SHIP HAD A STOMACH BUG LAST WEEK, AND IT'S BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL. IN FAIRNESS, DISEASES ARE BOUND TO BREAK OUT WHEN THE SAILORS ON YOUR SHIP DON'T WEAR ANY PANTS. I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW.

YOU MEAN SOMETHING NEW?
Jimmy: THE BICYCLE THING WAS A NEW THING NEW IN NEW YORK. YOU CLEARLY DON'T ENJOY THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, I DON'T. I CLEARLY DON'T ENJOY THAT. THE THING ABOUT BICYCLES IN NEW YORK IS THAT THERE'S THE SAME AMOUNT OF SPACE IN NEW YORK THAT THERE ALWAYS WAS. OKAY? IT'S AN ISLAND.

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MANHATTAN WHEN I SAY NEW YORK, I MEAN MANHATTAN. SO, IT'S AN ISLAND. SAME AMOUNT OF SPACE. AND STARTING WITH BLOOMBERG, THEY KEPT PUTTING MORE AND MORE STUFF IN THE STREET.

THIS TO ME IS THE GREATEST THING EVER.
Jimmy: YOU LIKE THIS?
YES, I LOVE THIS. BECAUSE I WENT TO A RESTAURANT THE OTHER NIGHT AND THERE WAS NO TIPPING. THE REASON IT'S GREAT -- NOT ONLY IS GREAT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT DIGNIFIED TO GIVE AND ACCEPT TIPS, IT'S A LITTLE UNDEMOCRATIC. BUT ON TOP OF THAT, IF YOU'RE REALLY BAD AT MATH LIKE ME, IT IS A NIGHTMARE, YOU KNOW. YOU THINK OF IT AS TIPPING. I THINK OF IT AS DIVISION. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T DO IT. I COUNT ON MY FINGERS. I'VE HAD MANY EXPERIENCES IN MY LIFE WHERE 4:00 IN THE MORNING, I GO, OH, MY GOD, I TIPPED 70%. [ LAUGHTER ] OR WORSE, OH, MY GOD, I TIPPED 7%, I CAN NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. SO NO TIPPING IS A GREAT IDEA.
Jimmy: IT TAKES THE MATH OUT.
THEY SHOULD HAVE IT ALSO IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS. I DON'T THINK DOORMEN WILL REALLY GO FOR THAT, BUT YES.
Jimmy: YOU SEE THAT AS WELL.
WELL, YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH IS THE DOORMAN I HATE THE LEAST -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: VERY NEW YORKY THING. YOUR OPINION -- CAN I GET QUICK -- I'D LIKE YOUR OPINION ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE HERE. WE HAVE -- LOOKS LIKE MAYBE DONALD TRUMP.
NOT MAYBE. I MEAN, FOR THE CANDIDATE.
Jimmy: FOR THE CANDIDATE.
YES, YES, DONALD TRUMP.
Jimmy: DONALD TRUMP, YEAH.
IT'S UNIMAGINABLE, RIGHT? BECAUSE IN NEW YORK, EVEN THE OTHER REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS DON'T TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, YES, IT WAS AN AMAZING THING. NO ONE BELIEVED IT. AND NOW IT IS TRUE. DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, IT'S LIKE -- IT SEEMS -- WHY NOT REGIS PHILBIN? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, I MEAN IT'S LIKE, DONALD TRUMP!
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU MUST HAVE MET DONALD IN NEW YORK.
I'VE SEEN HIM, YOU KNOW, AT VERY, VERY LARGE EVENTS. I'VE SEEN HIM, I'VE KIND OF LIKE -- HE ALWAYS, LIKE, NODS TO ME BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE JUST NODS TO EVERYBODY. MAYBE HE'S A REAL POLITICIAN. BUT I USUALLY SEE HIM AS I'M WALKING PAST HIM ON MY WAY TO TALK TO SOMEONE I ACTUALLY WANT TO TALK TO. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I DON'T KNOW HIM.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.
HE DOESN'T SEEM THAT HARD TO KNOW REALLY.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEN YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HILLARY CLINTON? IS THAT SOMETHING?
I'VE NEVER LOVED HER MORE.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YES, I LOVE HER NOW. EVERYONE HAS TO LOVE HER NOW BECAUSE SHE'S WHAT STANDS BETWEEN US AND DONALD TRUMP AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO I HAVE NOTHING -- I'M NEVER SAYING ANOTHER BAD THING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. BECAUSE, NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK OF HER, YOU MAY NOT LOVE HER BUT THE TRUTH IS SHE KNOWS HOW TO BE THE PRESIDENT. IT'S A HARD JOB. IT'S A VERY HARD JOB. NOT ANYONE CAN DO IT. CERTAINLY NOT DONALD TRUMP, OKAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S A REALLY HARD JOB. THIS IDEA THAT THEY WANT SOMEONE WHO'S NOT A POLITICIAN. IT'S LIKE, DID ANYONE EVER CALL YOU AND SAY, "I HAVE A HORRIBLE LEAK IN MY APARTMENT, DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S NOT A A PLUMBER?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ANYONE WHO'S NOT A A PLUMBER, YEAH.
I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY SURPRISING.
Jimmy: DO YOU LIKE HAVING PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU, ASKING FOR ADVICE, DOES THAT BOTHER YOU?
I LOVE TO BE ASKED FOR ADVICE. NO ONE EVER TAKES IT. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY. I FEEL LIKE I'VE BASICALLY BEEN GIVING ADVICE MY ENTIRE LIFE, NO ONE'S EVER TAKEN IT. HOWEVER, THERE IS A SITUATION NOW, I GUESS BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET, WHERE PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW, KIDS, BY WHICH I MEAN PEOPLE IN THEIR 20s, COME UP TO ME ON STREET AND ASK ME ABOUT ADVICE ABOUT THEIR OWN LIVES. YOU KNOW? "WHERE DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE, FRAN? YOU KNOW, DO YOU THINK I SHOULD BE THIS? SHOULD I BE THAT?" AND I THINK, "I DON'T CARE." [ LAUGHTER ] THESE KIDS ARE SO BELOVED BY THEIR PARENTS, THAT THEY JUST IMAGINE EVERYONE IS INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY DO. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T CARE, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ME. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW. I GO, "DON'T BECOME AN AX MURDERER, OKAY? PLEASE?" OTHER THAN THAT, I DON'T REALLY CARE.
Jimmy: I LOVE IT. WE LOVE HAVING YOU HERE. I CARE THAT YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU. PLEASE COME ON EVERY WEEK IF YOU CAN. FRAN LEBOWITZ, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MUSIC FROM GRIMES. STICK AROUND. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
