Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- MARGOT ROBBIE, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, MUSICAL GUEST, METALLICA, AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 544!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, HEY! ENJOY YOURSELF. WELCOME. WELCOME. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. ENJOY YOURSELF. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYONE TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE SHOW. THIS IS THE ONE TO BE AT TONIGHT. HOT SHOW TONIGHT. HOT SHOW! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, MY GOODNESS. WE'LL GET TO THE SHOW. FIRST, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, IT IS STILL THE ELECTION. AND I SAW THAT HILLARY CLINTON ACTUALLY WENT TO HER GRANDDAUGHTER'S SECOND BIRTHDAY PARTY INSTEAD OF PREPARING FOR THE FIRST DEBATE AGAINST TRUMP. YEAH. I GUESS SHE FIGURED BEING AROUND A BUNCH OF SCREAMING TODDLERS MIGHT HELP HER EVEN MORE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, HILLARY WENT TO HER GRANDDAUGHTER'S SECOND BIRTHDAY PARTY. APPARENTLY SHE PLAYED HER FAVORITE PARTY GAMES -- DUCK, DUCK, QUESTION AND PIN THE BLAME ON THE I.T. GUY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I NEVER HEARD THOSE -- WHILE SPEAKING TO THE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE YESTERDAY, HILLARY CLINTON SAID, QUOTE, "ISN'T THIS ONE OF THE STRANGEST ELECTIONS YOU'VE EVER SEEN?" AND THEN COLLEGE KIDS WERE LIKE, "UH, WE'RE 18. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT IS THE ONLY ELECTION WE'VE EVER SEEN." HAVEN'T SEEN THAT MANY. AND GET THIS. HILLARY SAID THAT WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN GOING TO LAW SCHOOL, SHE HAD TO TAKE OUT LOANS, BECAUSE HER DAD COULDN'T HELP HER PAY FOR IT. BECAUSE HE'D ALREADY GONE BROKE DONATING TO HER FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "ANOTHER FUNDRAISING LETTER? UGH, ALL RIGHT." I READ THAT JUST THIS PAST WEEK, HILLARY CLINTON SPENT $12 MILLION ON CAMPAIGN ADS COMPARED TO DONALD TRUMP WHO ONLY SPENT $600,000. AND YOU CAN REALLY TELL DONALD TRUMP IS DOING CAMPAIGN ADS AS CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS RECENT AD. ♪♪
OUR CHILDREN WATCH EVERYTHING WE DO. AND THE PERSON WE ELECT AS PRESIDENT HAS THE POWER TO SHAPE THEIR LIVES FOR YEARS TO COME. HILLARY HAS SPENT HER ENTIRE CAREER BRINGING FOLKS TOGETHER ON BEHALF OF OUR KIDS.
WRONG.
HILLARY WILL BE A PRESIDENT OUR KIDS CAN LOOK UP TO.
WRONG.
A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES IN OUR KIDS AND WILL FIGHT FOR THEM EVERY DAY.
WRONG.
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IN --
DONALD TRUMP!
I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME.
I'M --
DONALD TRUMP!
AND I APPROVED THIS MESSAGE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I GUESS IT GETS THE POINT ACROSS.
Steve: WRONG.
Jimmy: ACTUALLY, MICHELLE OBAMA IS CAMPAIGNING QUITE A BIT FOR HILLARY CLINTON. AND YESTERDAY SHE SAID HILLARY IS THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS RACE WHO HAS ANY IDEA WHAT BEING PRESIDENT IS LIKE. THEN TRUMP SAID, "I HEARD THAT ON THANKSGIVING, YOU GET TO FIRE A TURKEY." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] "THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING." AND BERNIE SANDERS IS ALSO CAMPAIGNING WITH HILLARY. YESTERDAY HE ASKED A CROWD AT ONE OF HER RALLIES, "IS EVERYBODY HERE READY TO TRANSFORM AMERICA?" FOLLOWED BY HIS NEXT QUESTION, "DOES ANYBODY HERE REMEMBER WHERE I PARKED?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "IT'S A '94 TAURUS. WITH THE LEFT BLINKER ON." AND GET THIS, DONALD TRUMP IS REPORTEDLY ANGRY THAT HIS ADVISERS ARE SAYING THAT HE STRUGGLED DURING THE FIRST DEBATE. THEN HIS ADVISORS WERE LIKE, "OH, SO YOU CAN HEAR US." [ LAUGHTER ] "IT WAS AS IF THERE WERE A WALL BETWEEN US." CHECK THIS OUT, YOU GUYS. E-SPORTS HAS BEEN GETTING REALLY BIG LATELY AND A LOT OF PROFESSIONAL VIDEO GAME PLAYERS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING PRETTY FAMOUS. HERE'S A GUY WHO GOES BY THE NAME OF SEAGULL FINISHING UP AND INTERVIEW AT A COMPETITION THIS WEEK. AND CHECK OUT HIS COOL HANDSHAKE AT THE END. WATCH.
EXCELLENT, MAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. AND WE'RE GONNA SEND IT BACK TO THE DESK RIGHT NOW. OH! [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU HANGING. I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU HANGING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, LET'S GET A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT HANDSHAKE. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS VIDEO GAMES HELP WITH THE HAND-EYE COORDINATION, BUT NOT HAND-HAND COORDINATION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, HERE'S A CRAZY STORY. THIS WEEK, A WOMAN IN TENNESSEE WALKED INTO HER HOME AND FOUND TWO BURGLARS HAVING SEX ON HER COUCH. WHEN THEY TRIED TO RUN AWAY, SHE YELLED, "AT LEAST STEAL THE COUCH!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHO NEEDS IT? WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT, YOU GUYS. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS!

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HE SAYS, "WHEN SOMEONE HAD A A COLD, MY GRANDMA USED TO TELL THEM TO DRINK TEQUILA BECAUSE, 'EITHER YOU'LL LOSE THE COLD OR YOU'LL FORGET ABOUT IT.'" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.
Jimmy: GOOD IDEA. THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS FROM @SHAWNGET. HE SAYS, "MY GRANDPA ONCE TOLD ME NOT TO USE MY BLINKER WHEN DRIVING, BECAUSE 'IT'S NO ONE'S BUSINESS WHERE YOU'RE GOING.'" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS. TELL YOU WHERE I'M GOIN'.
Steve: YOU TAKE CARE OF YOU.

I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM IN CONCERT. BUT I MEANT, I LOVE THEM.
Jimmy: DID YOU HAVE LIKE A A METAL PHASE, DID YOU EVER GET INTO?
I DID. I HAD A REAL LIKE HEAVY METAL PHASE. WHEN I WAS LIKE 14. AND I DYED MY HAIR BLACK AND I LITERALLY CUT WITH IT A RAZOR BLADE. AND I WOULD ONLY WEAR BAND SHIRTS AND LIKE ONLY LISTEN TO LIKE THE HEAVIEST OF HEAVY METAL.
Jimmy: AND WHO WERE YOU INTO?
I WAS A REALLY WEIRD PHASE. LIKE SILVERSTEIN AND LIKE BULLET FOR MY VALENTINE.
Jimmy: REALLY.
SLIPKNOT. I WENT TO A SLIPKNOT CONCERT. IT WAS ACTUALLY TO THIS DAY, PROBABLY THE BEST CONCERT I'VE EVER GONE TO.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
IT WAS AMAZING.
Jimmy: SLIPKNOT.
IT'S JUST AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE. EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE METAL, I THINK YOU WOULD APPRECIATE THE CONCERT. BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. I WAS ON A SOAP AT THE TIME IN AUSTRALIA CALLED "NEIGHBORS." AND, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THOSE PEOPLE THAT WOULD GENERALLY WATCH "NEIGHBORS." YOU'D IMAGINE IT WOULD BE LIKE FAMILIES AT DINNER TIME OR LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE. BUT AT THE SLIPKNOT CONCERT I GOT MORE RECOGNIZED AT THE SLIPKNOT CONCERT THAN ANYWHERE ELSE I'D EVER BEEN WHILST ON "NEIGHBORS." IT WAS SO WEIRD. AND I WAS LIKE WELL, THIS IS ONE PLACE NO ONE IS EVER GOING TO COME UP TO ME HERE. AND THESE HUGE GUYS WITH LIKE, TATTOOS AND LIKE, PIERCINGS EVERYWHERE, WOULD BE LIKE, IS BRIDGET'S BABY REALLY DEAD? AND I'LL BE LIKE  -- [ LAUGHTER ]

YEAH. I'VE BEEN UPSTAIRS ALL WEEK. IT'S REALLY FUN. BUT IT'S LIKE --
Jimmy: WHAT'S WEIRDING YOU OUT. WHAT'S MAKING YOU -- WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE?
IT -- IT'S JUST LIKE NOT -- I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF. AND LIKE SO MANY TIMES, WE DID THE TABLE READ YESTERDAY. AND WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO TO LORNE'S OFFICE AND LIKE -- JUST BE LIKE, YOU GOT THE WRONG GIRL FOR THE JOB. I'M SO SORRY BUT I SHOULDN'T DO THIS. YOU SHOULD GET SOMEONE ELSE TO COME IN AND DO IT. AND I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE BUT I'M GOING TO LIKE NOT DO IT.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HAVE YOU MET WITH THE WRITERS AND EVERYTHING? THEY HAVE GREAT WRITERS.
YES, NO. THEY ARE AMAZING.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE THE WEEKEND PERFORMING AS WELL.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU GET TO SEE HIM REHEARSE AT ALL?
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM REHEARSE. WE SHOT LIKE, ONE QUICK PROMO. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LIKE -- I DIDN'T WANT TO LIKE STAND OUT. IT IS SO WEIRD MEETING PEOPLE THAT YOU IDOLIZE. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE UNCOOL. LIKE, I MET KATE McKINNON. WE DID A PROMO. AND I'M LIKE SUCH A HUGE FAN OF HERS. I MET HER. AND I WAS JUST LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. IT WAS SO EMBARRASSING. SHE CAME OVER HERE. SHE WAS LIKE, A BIG FAN. BIG FAN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE NO, I'M YOUR FAN.
Jimmy: THAT IS A GREAT IMPRESSION OF KATE McKINNON. THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
SHE WAS LIKE, BIG FAN. I WAS LIKE, NO, I'M YOUR -- YOU NEVER SAY WHAT YOU THINK YOU WANT TO SAY WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE LIKE THAT. YOU JUST SOUND UNCOOL.
Jimmy: DID YOU GIVE ANY TATTOOS TO ANYONE THIS WEEK?
I HAVEN'T GIVEN A TATTOO THIS WEEK.
Jimmy: THE LAST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, AND THIS IS SOMETHING YOU END UP DOING ON THE SET. YOU ACTUALLY, ILLEGALLY, I SHOULD ADD --
IS THERE A LAW AGAINST IT?
Jimmy: I'M SURE YOU HAVE TO BE LICENSED. YOU CAN'T JUST DO THAT TO PEOPLE, YEAH.
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED IF IT IS LIKE OKAY TO DO THAT.
Jimmy: YOU GIVE TATTOOS TO PEOPLE ON THE SET AND THEY LET YOU DO IT BECAUSE YOU'RE SO CHARMING AND NICE.
THEY MAKE IT SEEM LIKE FUN. THEN AFTERWARDS, WHY DID I DO IT?
Jimmy: GIVE ME A DRAWING OF WHAT YOU WOULD TATTOO.
YEAH, LAST TIME I WAS HERE.
Jimmy: AND YOU DREW THIS. A LITTLE GIRL WITH A BALLOON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S MY SPECIALTY. LIKE STICK FIGUREY.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT SO MUCH. SERIOUSLY, I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE CUTEST DRAWINGS EVER AND I'M NOT READY TO GET A TATTOO.
MAYBE NEXT TIME.
Jimmy: BUT I WAS THINKING, I HAD A RUBBER STAMP MADE OF THE DRAWING. I THOUGHT MAYBE IF YOU WOULD LIKE, YOU CAN GIVE ME MY FIRST TATTOO. IT IS JUST -- IT'S KIND OF TEMPORARY. IT WILL LAST THE WEEKEND.
OH, MY GOD!

I'VE NOT BEEN GAINFULLY EMPLOYED SINCE I'VE BEEN 26. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I'M GONNA NEED HELP WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS JOB.

UH OH.
Jimmy: NO, I'M SERIOUS. IT WAS A MOVING SPEECH. AND IT WAS GREAT. IT WAS RIGHT AFTER THE BOSTON MARATHON ATTACK. AND, YOU SPOKE SO ELOQUENTLY AND BEAUTIFULLY ABOUT AMERICA AND HOW, YOU KNOW, WE STAND UP TO, YOU KNOW, TO THESE ATTACKS AND WE DON'T LET TERROR STOP US. IT JUST, IT WAS FANTASTIC. PEOPLE WERE CRYING. WHEN I SAY PEOPLE, I WAS CRYING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU QUOTED AN IRISH POEM. AND I THINK IT WAS HEANEY OR SOMETHING.
SEAMUS HEANEY, YEAH.
Jimmy: SEAMUS HEANEY?
"THE CURE OF TROY." THERE'S A STANZA IN THIS POEM THAT I THINK DESCRIBES WHERE WE ARE NOW, IF WE'RE SMART. HE SAYS, "HISTORY TEACHES US NOT TO HOPE ON THIS SIDE OF THE GRAVE, BUT THEN ONCE IN A A LIFETIME, THAT LONGED-FOR TIDAL WAVE OF JUSTICE RISES UP AND HOPE AND HISTORY RHYME." I REALLY THINK WE'RE AT THAT PLACE IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IF WE JUST HAVE THE NERVE TO SEIZE THE MOMENT. I -- THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEVER BEND, THEY NEVER BREAK, THEY'RE GENEROUS. AND I WISH WE WOULD STOP TALKING ABOUT HOW, WHAT TROUBLE WE'RE IN. WE ARE IN A BETTER POSITION THAN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO OWN THE 21st CENTURY. WE REALLY ARE.

YOUR MONOLOGUES ARE GOOD.
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT AMAZES ME ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, AND IT'S NOT -- HE'S PROBABLY A DECENT GUY. BUT IT'S HIS LACK OF SENSIBILITIES. I MEAN, THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WELL, YOU KNOW, I WAS ROOTING FOR THE HOUSING MARKET TO FAIL BECAUSE THAT'S BUSINESS. THAT'S NOT BUSINESS. THAT'S CALLOUS. I MEAN, THAT'S NOT BUSINESS. OR I PAID NO TAXES AND THAT MAKES ME SMART. WHAT DOES IT MAKE, THE REST US SUCKERS? I MEAN -- NO, I REALLY MEAN IT. THINK ABOUT IT. CAN YOU THINK OF ANY PRESIDENT, ANY PRESIDENT YOU'VE STUDIED, READ ABOUT OR KNEW WHO WOULD SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT? NAME ME ONE PRESIDENT WHO WOULD DO THAT. IT ANGERS ME QUITE FRANKLY.

YOU KNOW LOOK --
Jimmy: IS IT A LOOPHOLE?
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REALLY RESENT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE BEING PLAYED FOR SUCKERS. AND YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY WORKING THE ASSEMBLY LINE MAKING $51,000 AND HIS WIFE MAKING $50,000 WORKING AS, YOU KNOW, IN ANOTHER FACTORY. AND THEY'RE PAYING 15% OF THEIR INCOME, THEY'RE TRYING TO RAISE TWO KIDS. I MEAN, I JUST DON'T -- I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY SOMEBODY WOULD SAY THAT. LIKE THAT MAKES ME SMART. YOU KNOW, MY DAD HAD AN EXPRESSION, FOR REAL. WHEN SOMEONE SAYS, YOU KNOW, JOE, I PAY TOO MUCH IN TAXES. HE SAID, LOOK, IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY. I MEAN, JUST PAY YOUR FAIR SHARE, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

I KNOW YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK AND --
Jimmy: WOW, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BOY, OH, BOY DO I, YEAH. ARE YOU -- ARE YOU -- ARE YOU SHOCKED THAT THE POLLS ARE THIS CLOSE OR ARE THEY THIS CLOSE OR THEY'RE JUST FAKE NUMBERS?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I YIELD TO THE AUDIENCE ON THIS. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, EVERY ELECTION, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE LAST FOUR, PEOPLE ARE TAKING LONGER AND LONGER TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS. MY GRANDPOP USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. HE'D SAY, JOEY, FOLKS DON'T DECIDE HOW THEY'RE GONNA VOTE UNTIL AFTER THE WORLD SERIES. I DON'T THINK IT TAKES THAT LONG BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY -- I THINK THEY'RE REALLY UNEASY. THEY'RE NOT -- THEY'RE NOT -- I DON'T THINK THEY'VE REALLY MADE UP THEIR MINDS YET. AND I THINK -- BUT IT HAS SURPRISED ME, I MUST TELL YOU, IT HAS SURPRISED ME, THAT HE DID AS WELL AS HE DID IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES. AND IT SURPRISED ME THAT HE'S SORT OF STILL IN THE GAME. AND AGAIN, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT HIS CHARACTER. I'M NOT ATTACKING IT. IT JUST -- HE JUST SEEMS SO -- I'VE NEVER KNOWN OF A CANDIDATE WHO KNOWS AS LITTLE ABOUT THE WORLD AS THIS MAN DOES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NO, NO, REALLY. [ APPLAUSE ] LOOK, LOOK. I WAS IN AUSTRALIA WITH THE PRIME MINISTER. NOT HAD TO, I WENT DOWN THERE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT CHINA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA. AND I GOT A CALL FROM THE PRESIDENT OF LATVIA. WOULD I COME AND SPEAK TO THE BALTIC STATE PRESIDENT. I FLEW ALL THE WAY THERE JUST TO ASSURE THEM THAT WE, THAT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, THOUGHT THE COMMITMENT IN NATO WAS A SACRED COMMITMENT. WE WOULD DEFEND THEM. BECAUSE TRUMP IS SAYING, I'M NOT SURE, MAN. HAVE YOU PAID UP YOUR DUES, MAN? I MEAN, THIS GUY -- I DON'T EVEN THINK HE UNDERSTANDS HOW MUCH DAMAGE HE DOES, BY WHAT HE'S ALREADY SAID. I MEAN, BECAUSE EUROPE, ESPECIALLY CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE IS SCARED TO DEATH ABOUT WHAT PUTIN MAY OR MAY NOT DO. AND THIS GUY -- I MEAN, LOOK, BUT THERE IS HOPE. HE FOUND OUT CRIMEA IS PART OF UKRAINE. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE'LL -- [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE HE'LL FIND OUT -- IT' ALMOST LIKE THE GUY DIDN'T REALLY INTEND TO DO THIS. HE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THIS WAS A LARK AND IT WILL GO SOMEWHERE AND MY GOD, HERE WE GO, GUYS.
Jimmy: BUT HAVE YOU SEEN GARY JOHNSON AT ALL IN ANY INTERVIEW? HE COULDN'T NAME A WORLD LEADER YESTERDAY. HE COULDN'T NAME A WORLD LEADER. NOT ONE. IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE THAT ARE THINKING ABOUT --
HE THOUGHT ALEPPO WAS A DOG FOOD OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: HE DID, YEAH. HE DIDN'T KNOW. YEAH.
NOW, LOOK, IT JUST IS, YOU KNOW, I'VE TRAVELED OVER A A MILLION, 100,000 MILES AS VICE PRESIDENT, FOR THE PRESIDENT. AND A LOT OF THE AUDIENCE MAY HAVE TRAVELED TO A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES. AND THE REST OF THE WORLD'S, LIKE, GOING, WHAT'S GOING ON? BUT, LOOK. I JUST THINK HILLARY, YOU'D EXPECT ME TO SAY THIS, OKAY? BUT HILLARY IS ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST PEOPLE I'VE EVER KNOWN. HAS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE. AND I FEEL -- AND I THINK SHE'S GOING TO WIN AND I THINK WE'LL BE IN GOOD HANDS. LOOK, NOBODY -- NOBODY'S PERFECT. EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW, WANTS THE IDEAL CANDIDATE. BY THE WAY, I LEARNED HOW TO BECOME THE IDEAL CANDIDATE. ANNOUNCE YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OH! OH! THAT'S AMAZING!
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING! MORE WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYBODY THIS THING THAT KIND OF WENT AROUND. IT WAS A MEMO THAT YOU SENT TO YOUR STAFF AND IT KIND OF MADE THE ROUNDS. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT PUBLIC. BUT IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. IT SAYS, TO MY WONDERFUL STAFF, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR TO EVERYONE. I DON'T EXPECT NOR DO I WANT ANY OF YOU TO YOU MISS OR SACRIFICE IMPORTANT FAMILY OBLIGATIONS FOR WORK. FAMILY OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO FAMILY BIRTHDAYS, ANNIVERSARIES, WEDDINGS, AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES SUCH AS FIRST COMMUNIONS, BAR MITZVAHS, GRADUATIONS, TIMES OF NEEDS SUCH AS ILLNESS OR LOSS OF A A FAMILY. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. IN FACT, I WOULD GO SO FAR TO SAY IF I FIND OUT THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH ME WHILE MISSING IMPORTANT FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES, IT WILL DISAPPOINT ME GREATLY. THIS HAS BEEN AN UNWRITTEN RULE SINCE MY DAYS IN THE SENATE. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HARD WORK. SINCERELY, JOE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BEST THING I HAVE EVER READ. AND I LOVED IT.
WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST GOT TO THE SENATE, I GOT ELECTED WHEN I WAS 29. BEFORE I TURNED 30, OR JUST AFTER I TURNED 30, I WAS DOWN HIRING STAFF. MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. AND MY TWO BOYS WERE REALLY BADLY INJURED. AND I THOUGHT I WAS A DECENT FATHER BEFORE THEN. BUT YOU REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, IN MY GENERATION, IT WAS ABOUT QUALITY TIME INSTEAD OF QUANTITY TIME. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS QUALITY TIME. EVERY IMPORTANT THING YOUR CHILD WILL SAY TO YOU WILL BE OFF SCRIPT, AS THEY SAY. WILL BE AT A TIME WHEN YOU DON'T EXPECT IT. AND KIDS CAN HOLD AN IDEA FOR MAYBE 12, 14 HOURS. BUT AFTER THAT, IT'S GONE, MAN. YOU LOSE IT. AND THIS IDEA OF THE WAY WE ALL RATIONALIZE. YOU KNOW? I HAD TO TAKE RED EYE TO GET HOME FOR A BIRTHDAY. BUT YOU KNOW, IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER THAT MUCH TO MY WIFE, HER BIRTHDAY. OR IF I JUST MAKE THIS BUSINESS TRIP, I'LL MISS HIS LAST FOOTBALL GAME BUT HE'LL UNDERSTAND. A BUNCH OF MALARKEY. IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. IT'S NOT TRUE. AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY IN MY STAFF FEELING AN OBLIGATION TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING THAT MATTERS IN THE FAMILY. AND THERE IS NOTHING NOBLE ABOUT IT. I DO IT. WHEN I RAN A SECOND TIME, I WAS, I HAD MISSED 14% OF THE VOTES THE FIRST TIME. AND I RAN AGAINST A GOOD GUY. AND HE HAD A VERY EFFECTIVE AD. HE SAID, WOULD YOU HIRE SOMEONE WHO MISSED 14 DAYS OUT OF EVERY HUNDRED DAYS? HE WON'T WORK FOR YOU. AND I NEVER MISSED A VOTE, THEY WERE DECISIVE PROCEDURAL VOTES. I WENT ON THE AIR AND I SAID, LOOK, ELECT ME AGAIN. AND I HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN A A PROCEDURAL VOTE OR GOING ON A A PARENT-TEACHER MEETING, I'M GOING TO THE PARENT-TEACHER MEETING. AND IF I CAN HOLD MYSELF TO THAT -- [ APPLAUSE ] BY THE WAY, IT IS A LOT EASIER FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE A MILLION EMPLOYERS. NO, I REALLY MEAN IT. IT IS HARDER WHEN YOU HAVE A A BOSS. SO I FELT, IF COULD I DO THAT, I SHOULD NOT HOLD MY STAFF TO ANY DIFFERENT STANDARD. AND BY THE WAY, I GET MORE PRODUCTIVITY OUT MY STAFF THAN PEOPLE GET WHO ARE YOU KNOW DEMANDING.
Jimmy: I SAID TO MY STAFF, I LOVE THIS IDEA IF IT DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH WORK. [ LAUGHTER ] FIGURE IT OUT. WE CAN TALK. WE CAN TALK. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. THE CUE CARD GUYS ARE ALREADY LEAVING. HEY ROMAN, NOTHING IS HAPPENING THIS LATE AT NIGHT. OKAY, NO BALLGAMES ARE ON RIGHT NOW.
ANYWAY,
Jimmy: I WANT TO TELL YOU. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT THING, A GREAT MESSAGE. I HAVE 2 DAUGHTERS AND I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. I GO, I JUST WISH --
HOLD THEM TIGHT, MAN. IT GOES. IT GOES VERY QUICKLY.
Jimmy: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT "IT'S ON US" CAMPAIGN. YOU HAVE TO BE PROUD OF THIS.
WELL, I AM. MY DAD, MY DAD WAS A GRACEFUL GENTLE MAN. HE USED TO SAY THAT THE GREATEST SIN IS THE ABUSE OF POWER, AND THE CARDINAL SIN OF ALL IS FOR A MAN TO RAISE HIS HAND TO A WOMAN OR A CHILD. WE CAN CHANGE THE CULTURE HERE. WE CAN CHANGE THE CULTURE. AND NO MEANS NO. IF A WOMAN CAN'T RESPOND BECAUSE SHE'S INEBRIATED OR UNDER THE INFLUENCE, THEN IT'S RAPE. IT'S REAL SIMPLE PROPOSITION. AND I'M CONFIDENT THE VAST MAJORITY -- YOU KNOW, I HAD MY STAFF, CONSTANTLY SURVEY WHEN THE EFFECT HAS BEEN, VIOLENT CRIME AGAINST WOMEN IS DOWN BY OVER 60%. BUT ONE THING I FOUND OUT. THAT WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18 AND 24, NOTHING HAD CHANGED. THEY WERE BEING AS BRUTALIZED AS THEY WERE BEFORE. AND THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED THIS NOTION OF, WE ASKED, WE WENT ON ONE OF THESE TOWN HALL MEETINGS WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN COLLEGES. AND WE SAID WHAT CAN WE DO? AND THEY SAID GET MEN INVOLVED GET MEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. ANY MAN WHO TAKES A DRUNK WOMAN UP THE STAIRS IN A FRATERNITY HOUSE IS A DAMN COWARD, MAN. THERE IS NOTHING MANLY ABOUT THIS. THEY SHOULD GET KNOCKED ON THEIR ASS. AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THIS. AND I'M CONVINCED, I'M CONVINCED THE VAST MAJORITY OF MEN UNDERSTAND AND IT'S ABOUT TIME WE SPEAK UP AND WE INTERVENE WHEN WE SEE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S JUST AMAZING.
IT'S NOT AMAZING. I'M JUST TOO PASSIONATE ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: I LOVE ALL THESE THINGS THAT YOU DO AND I WANT TO GET ON A LIGHTER NOTE. ANOTHER THING I ENJOYED WAS THIS PHOTO OF YOU EATING ICE CREAM WITH SUNGLASSES ON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING, YOU'RE HOLDING MONEY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. BUT IT REALLY --
IT WAS A PAYOFF.
Jimmy: IT MADE ME LAUGH AND I HAD TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY, SINCE YOU'RE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND YOU ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE WEEKS LEFT. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE AN ICE CREAM CONE.
I'M IN, MAN.
Jimmy: YOU ARE? THIS IS THE TONIGHT DOUGH ICE CREAM. BEN AND JERRY'S. AND ALL THE PROCEEDS TO GO SERIOUS FUND, WHICH IS PAUL NEWMAN'S HOLE IN THE WALL. IT IS. GOOD HAVE YOU HAD IT BEFORE? YOU'RE FORGETTING THE BEST PART.
YOU KNOW, FOR MY WHOLE CAREER, I'VE BEEN LISTED AS THE POOREST MAN IN THE SENATE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'VE BEEN WEARING THESE SINCE I WAS 16. THEY'RE COMING BACK.
