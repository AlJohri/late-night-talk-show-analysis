HOW'S IT GOING EVERYBODY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HELLO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN NEW YORK CITY. I WAS JUST IN KANSAS. ANYBODY HERE EVER BEEN TO KANSAS BEFORE? [ SMALL CHEERS ] YEAH? UHH, HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS. IF YOU HAVE OR YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO KANSAS, IT'S THE EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA HOW EMPTY KANSAS IS. MY PLANE LANDED AT 8:00. MY SHOW STARTED AT 8:00, AND I MADE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS NOT ENOUGH STUFF IN YOUR WAY. YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL FOR THREE HOURS IN KANSAS, WAKE UP AND YOU'RE FINE. YOU DIDN'T HIT ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU JUST RAN OUT OF GAS, AND YOU'RE PROBABLY HOME BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN A FIELD. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY HAVE A $3 BILLION SOCCER STADIUM IN KANSAS. BILLION WITH A B. I'M LIKE, "WHERE DID KANSAS GET $3 BILLION FOR A SOCCER STADIUM?" AND THEN YOU LOOK AROUND AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, THEY JUST DIDN'T SPEND IT ON ANYTHING ELSE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'VE BEEN SAVING UP ALL THE MONEY THEY HAD FOR YEARS TO BUY ONE FUN TOY LIKE A A NINE-YEAR-OLD AND A A SKATEBOARD." [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF KIDS, I JUST HAD A A NEW BABY GIRL. WE HAD A GIRL BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] I'M KIDDING. I LOVE HER, I KISS HER FACE ALL THE TIME. I AM GOING TO MAKE HER GET A A JOB AS SOON AS HE'S OLD ENOUGH, WHICH IS 13. THAT'S HOW OLD I WAS WHEN I GOT MY FIRST JOB. I'LL BE LIKE, "GET A JOB." AND SHE'LL BE LIKE, "WHAT'D YOU DO WHEN YOU WERE MY AGE?" AND I'LL BE LIKE, "PAPER ROUTE." AND SHE'LL BE LIKE, "WHAT'S THAT?" [ LAUGHTER ] I'LL BE LIKE, "OH, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, WE USED TO DELIVER 30 PAGES OF THE INTERNET, AT A A TIME, TO EVERY HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ON A BICYCLE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] SHE'LL BE LIKE, "WHAT'S A A BICYCLE?" I'LL BE LIKE, "YOU'RE GROUNDED FOR BEING FROM THE FUTURE." [ LAUGHTER ] "GO TO YOUR POD AND STAY IN THIS DIMENSION." I DON'T KNOW HOW ADVANCED WE'LL BE. UHH, I'M GLAD I'M MARRIED NOW. MY LAST FIRST DATE BEFORE I MET MY WIFE WAS A DISASTER. IT WAS WITH A MODEL. YOU GUYS BROUGHT HER UP. I GUESS WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, UHH -- I ALREADY THOUGHT WE WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON. RIGHT? AND THEN I WAS LIKE, TRYING TO FIND COMMON GROUND. I WAS LIKE, "SO, WHAT KIND OF THE MUSIC DO YOU LIKE?" AND SHE WAS LIKE, "OH, I DON'T." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?" AND SHE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I DON'T LIKE GET MUSIC. LIKE, I DON'T LIKE IT THAT MUCH." AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, COOL, SO YOU'RE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH. THAT'S AWESOME." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S INFORMATION THAT YOU SHOULD SAVE FOR LATER WHEN IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME TO LEAVE THE RELATIONSHIP. THAT'S LIKE IF A SERIAL KILLER SAYS SOMETHING WAY TOO CREEPY BEFORE HE GETS YOU ALL THAT WAY BACK TO HIS LAIR OR WHATEVER. AND YOU STILL THINK HE'S A NICE NORMAL DUDE GIVING YOU A RIDE HOME IN HIS VAN. AND ALL THE SUDDEN HE LOOKS OVER, AND HE'S LIKE, "YOUR SKIN LOOKS COMFORTABLE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU'RE LIKE, "WHAT?" AND HE'S LIKE, "NOTHING." [ LAUGHTER ] HAVE ANOTHER DAIQUIRI." I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU WOULD GET A FRESH DAIQUIRI IN A VAN, BUT I'M NOT SERIAL KILLER. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LURE ADULTS INTO A VAN. I ASSUME FROZEN DRINKS ARE IRRESISTIBLE AT ANY AGE. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, NOW I'M THINKING ABOUT A DUDE WITH A VAN AND A A DAIQUIRI MACHINE IN THE PACK AND THAT GUY SEEMS LIKE THE COOLEST GUY YOU'LL EVER MEET IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. SO, THAT'S A TOUGH ONE. WELL, IF YOU'RE WALKING TO WORK, AND A VAN'S LIKE ERRR, AND A GUY SLIDES OUT THE DOOR AND HE'S LIKE, "HEY MAN, DO YOU WANT A RIDE? I HAVE A DAIQUIRI MACHINE." YOU'RE LIKE, "OH MAN, THIS COULD GO EITHER WAY." [ LAUGHTER ] "AHH." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "I LOVE DAIQUIRIS, I HATE WALKING." I'D GET HIS NAME, RIGHT? BECAUSE IF HE'S NOT A SERIAL KILLER, HE'S THE FUNNEST DUDE IN THE WORLD. HE'S GOING TO HAVE A PARTY NICKNAME FROM HIS GUY FRIENDS, RIGHT? SO, IF YOU'RE LIKE, "WHAT'S YOUR NAME?" AND, HE'S LIKE, "HURRICANE PHIL." GET IN THE VAN! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT IS THE BEST RIDE TO WORK OF YOU LIFE. YOU PROBABLY WON'T EVEN GO TO WORK. BUT, IF YOU'RE LIKE, "WHAT'S YOUR NAME?" AND HE'S LIKE, -- [ QUIETLY ] "KYLE." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT THE FUNNEST DUDE IN THE WORLD. THAT'S A SERIAL KILLER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, THE ONLY REASON HE DOESN'T HAVE A NICKNAME YET IS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T CATCH HIM YET. BUT, AS SOON AS THEY CATCH HIM, HE'S GOING TO BE CHLOROFORM KYLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU DIED FOR A DAIQUIRI BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR NOT MAKING A NOISE AT ALL WHEN I SAID A I HAD A NEW BABY. THAT WAS AWESOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S OKAY. IT'S FAR TOO LATE. [ LAUGHTER ] TO GIVE YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT YOU'RE LIKE. KANSAS, STANDING OVATION WHEN I SAID I HAD A BABY. THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPIER FOR ME. BECAUSE IN THE MIDWEST, PEOPLE HAVE HEARTS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, THEY GET REALLY EXCITED FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS. THEY'RE LIKE, "OH MY GOD. YOU JUST HAD A BABY. YOUR HEART'S GOING TO GET SO BIG. WE CAN'T WAIT." [ LAUGHTER ] AND IN NEW YORK, YOU'RE LIKE, "I JUST HAD A BABY." AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "AHH. [ LAUGHTER ] WAIT, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO THINK ABOUT YOURSELF, ENOUGH?" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M JULIAN McCULLOUGH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: JULIAN McCULLOUGH! IF YOU FOLKS ARE IN CLEVELAND, CHECK HIM OUT AT THE HARD ROCK ROCKSINO JUNE 19TH THROUGH THE 21ST! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! COME ON, BROTHER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
