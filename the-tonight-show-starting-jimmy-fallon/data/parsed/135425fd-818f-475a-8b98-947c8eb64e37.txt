Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HEY! I FEEL THE LOVE. I LOVE YOU RIGHT BACK. HELLO EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW" EVERYBODY. HERE WE ARE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HOT SHOW TONIGHT, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT'S ANOTHER SCANDAL FOR HILARY CLINTON. YEAH. NOW THERE'S -- NOW THEY'RE SAYING THAT SHE MAY HAVE USED A A PRIVATE E-MAIL ADDRESS WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, WHICH MEANS THE GOVERNMENT THEY COULDN'T ARCHIVE AND PRESERVE HER E-MAIL. AND OBAMA WAS LIKE, "OH, DON'T WORRY. WE SAW THEM. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SAW EVERYONE'S E-MAILS." SO IT WAS REVEALED HILARY CLINTON USED A PRIVATE E-MAIL ACCOUNT TO CONDUCT OFFICIAL STATE BUSINESS. EXPERTS SAY THAT, "IF THIS VIOLATES ANY FEDERAL RULES SHE WILL STILL BE PRESIDENT." [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I MEAN, AT THIS POINT, WHO ARE WE KIDDING? WHY -- [ APPLAUSE ] AND DID YOU SEE THIS? THE ARTIST THAT PAINTED AN OFFICIAL PICTURE OF BILL CLINTON JUST REVEALED THAT HE INCLUDED A SHADOW IN THE BACKGROUND TO REPRESENT THE MONICA LEWINSKY SCANDAL. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS MORNING CLINTON SAW THE SHADOW WHICH MEANS OF COURSE SIX MORE WEEKS OF SPRING BREAK. SO IT'S LIKE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS BIG NEWS TODAY, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU GAVE A A SPEECH TO CONGRESS. APPARENTLY THE SPEECH AIRED IN ISRAEL WITH A FIVE MINUTE DELAY SO ISRAELIS COULD CUT AWAY FROM ANY MOMENTS WHERE HE APPEARED TO CAMPAIGNING FOR RE-ELECTION. SO BASICALLY ISRAELIS HAD TO WAIT FIVE MINUTES TO HEAR WHAT THEIR PRESIDENT IS SAYING, OR AS AMERICANS CALL THAT, WATCHING OBAMA LIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] "EVERY SPEECH, I MAKE, TAKES, THREE HOURS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW LOOK -- GET TO THE -- NOW LOOK." SOME INTERNATIONAL NEWS, ALTHOUGH RUSSIA'S ECONOMY IS STILL STRUGGLING AND TENSIONS ARE HIGH IN UKRAINE, A NEW POLL SHOWS VLADIMIR PUTIN'S APPROVAL RATING IS AT 86%. WOW. SOUNDS HIGH UNTIL YOU CONSIDER THERE'S AN 86% CHANCE A RUSSIAN WILL BE MURDERED IF THEY ANSWER THAT SURVEY WRONG. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO IT'S LIKE THIS, "YOU LIKE WHAT HE'S DOING?" "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH." SOME TV NEWS, CBS HAS EXTENDED JUDGE JUDY'S CONTRACT THROUGH THE YEAR 2020. IT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT SHE'LL HAVE A JOB. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED THE ONLY THING TO DO IS WATCH "JUDGE JUDY." [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT'S VERY TRICKY TO -- HOW'S SHE GOING TO DO THAT? AND THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. I READ THAT SYLVESTER STALLONE HAD TO BREAK UP A BRAWL BETWEEN TWO ACTORS ON THE SET OF HIS NEW "ROCKY" MOVIE. YEAH, IT SOUNDED PRETTY INTENSE.

Jimmy: SOCIAL FAUX PAS -- WELL I THINK IT'S RUDE WHEN PEOPLE TAKE UP AN ENTIRE ESCALATOR STEP SO YOU CAN'T GET AROUND THEM.
Kamal: THAT'S A SOCIAL FAUX PAS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOCIAL FAUX PAS! WHAT ELSE?
Jimmy: WHEN YOU'RE BUYING SOMETHING AT A COUNTER AND YOU HAVE BOTH YOUR EAR BUDS IN.
Kamal: SOCIAL FAUX PAS. THAT'S A MAJOR SOCIAL INDISCRETION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FAUX PAS HIGH FIVE! [ SLAP ] [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ANOTHER ONE, WHEN THE SKINNIEST PERSON IN A CROWDED CAR DOESN'T TAKE THE MIDDLE SEAT.
Kamal: THAT'S A BIG TIME SOCIAL FAUX PAS. TAKE THE BITCH SEAT, BITCH! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HEY -- COME ON. THAT'S A LITTLE MUCH, DON'T YOU THINK? THAT'S A LITTLE -- LITTLE MUCH.

Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Kamal: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE OF THE "TONIGHT SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: STOP, STOP, STOP. WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. THANKS. KAMAL FROM THE ROOTS EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S KAMAL. FINALLY, AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD, BOSTON IS ON TRACK TO BREAK THE RECORD FOR THE SNOWIEST WINTER THIS WEEK AND THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO BAD THAT PEOPLE ARE -- THEY ARE ACTUALLY CALLING DIBS ON THEIR PARKING SPACES THEY SHOVELED OUT WEEKS AGO. SO THEY'RE PUTTING ALL KINDS OF JUNK IN THE STREETS TO SAVE THEIR SPOTS. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS IT'S GOTTEN OUT OF HAND. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
TODAY THOUGH, BOSTON TRANSPORTATION CREWS WILL START REMOVING PARKING SPOT SAVERS. EVERYTHING FROM ORANGE CONES, TO DINING ROOM TABLES, OFFICE CHAIRS, AND EVEN LAUNDRY BASKETS.

TECHNICALLY THIS SPACE AND EVERY OTHER SPACE SAVER ON THIS STREET NEEDS TO BE GONE BY THURSDAY. THAT'S THE TRASH PICK UP DAY IN THIS PART OF SOUTH BOSTON. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] RESIDENTS GOT THAT NEWS OVER THE WEEKEND AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THEY WEREN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT.

IT'S JUST EVERYTHING. THE GREAT THING IS THIS IS A A GOOD FILM TO SEE ON A COLD, WET, SNOWY EVENING, ACTUALLY.

NOT THAT I'M ADVERTISING IT. BUT IT'S A GREAT FILM, BECAUSE THE HEAT OF INDIA IS ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS. AND REALLY, IT'S SO COLORFUL. AND IT WAS HUGELY GOOD FUN TO DO. PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY CHARMING.

NO.
Jimmy: BECAUSE YOU WERE SCARED ON THE MOTORCYCLE. IS THAT TRUE?
YES, I WAS KEPT RATHER AWAY FROM IT. I JUST KNEW I HAD TO TRAVEL ON THE BACK OF IT A LOT, AND I JUST -- HE GOT ON WITH IT AND REHEARSED IT A LOT, AND I JUST PRAYED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THEN CAME THE TIME -- AND I KNEW THAT WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS SIT SIDESADDLE WITHOUT A A HELMET ON THE BACK. AND JUST LOOK. THAT WAS FINE. AND WE WERE GOING ALONG LIKE THIS.

I'D MAKE VERY RUDE CUSHIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] I USED TO DO -- THEY WERE, I THOUGHT, RATHER BEAUTIFUL AND DELICATE.

SO I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON IT. IT WAS FRIGHTFULLY RUDE. [ LAUGHTER ]

SOMETIMES IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE WANT AND WHAT WE FEAR IS THE WIDTH OF AN EYELASH.
I'M SORRY. WERE YOU TALKING TO ME?
WELL, THE HEARING'S GONE THEN OBVIOUSLY.
YEAH, ALONG WITH YOUR BACKBONE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I TELL YOU ANYTHING.
BECAUSE I'M OLDER AND WISER.
19 DAYS OLDER.

WELL THEY THOUGHT WE ALL OUGHT TO -- WE ALL HAD TO JOIN IN AT THE END, SO THEY SAID, "WE OUGHT TO HAVE A GREAT CHOREOGRAPHY LESSON." BUT IN ACTUAL FACT, WE SAID, "WELL, IF WE'RE JUST JOINING IN, IT SHOULD BE KIND OF RATHER RANDOM." IT WAS ACTUALLY QUITE RANDOM.
Jimmy: IT WAS RANDOM.

Jimmy: OKAY, LET ME SEE IF I CAN JUST DO IT RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: READY? FIRST ONE IS -- NICHOLAS -- [ LAUGHTER ]
I BELIEVE IT'S AITHADI.
Jimmy: NO.
A, Y, Y, THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME.
Jimmy: AITHADI?
AITHADI. EXACTLY.
Jimmy: NO, I COULDN'T DO THAT. I'M TOTALLY PULLING A TRAVOLTA HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] DAN -- DeLEEYOU?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: DAN DeLEEUW.
DAN DeLEEUW.
Jimmy: THAT SEEMS FAKE, YEAH -- DAN DeLEEUW? THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO MESS WITH YOU THERE.
SO THIS IS -- THIS IS WHAT I ENDED UP GETTING. SO, ACTUALLY I LOOKED AT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE WON --
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE FREAKING OUT?
AND I'M FREAKING OUT --
Jimmy: SWEATING.
AND I SAID, "OKAY, I REALLY HOPE 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY' -- NO OFFENSE, DOESN'T WIN, BECAUSE IT WAS ALL THE FOUR NAMES THAT I COULDN'T PRONOUNCE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU'RE ROUTING AGAINST THEM?
YEAH, OF COURSE. I MEAN, LIKE YOU SAID, I DIDN'T WANT TO PULL A TRAVOLTA. IT'S THE OSCARS. I'D NEVER BE INVITED BACK. SO I LOOKED UP WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO WIN AND SUPPOSEDLY THE WINNER WAS GOING TO BE "INTERSTELLAR." THAT WAS THE FAVORITE.
Jimmy: YEP.
AND LOOK AT THE "INTERSTELLAR" NAMES.
Jimmy: "INTERSTELLER" -- OH, THAT'S EASY. [ LAUGHTER ]
PAUL FRANKLIN --
Jimmy: OH, COME ON! THAT'S EASY, THAT'S NOT FAIR. THAT'S EASY. HOW ABOUT THESE GUYS? DAN DeLEEUW AND NICHOLAS AITHADI -- AITHADI. NICHOLAS AITHADI.
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY THAT SOMEONE WON AN OSCAR. YOUR WORK WAS GREAT AND YOUR NAMES ARE EVEN BETTER. CONGRATULATIONS.
Jimmy: DID YOUR MOM ENJOY THE OSCARS? DID SHE HAVE FUN?
YEAH.
Jimmy: WAS SHE NERVOUS?
SHE LOVED IT. YOU KNOW, GOING TO THE OSCARS IS EPIC AND WE ALWAYS WATCHED IT, SO SHE LOVED GOING. BUT SHE HAD NO CLUE WHO ANYONE WAS. WHICH IS WAS HILARIOUS.
Jimmy: SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO WATCH MOVIES?
SHE CLAIMS SHE DOES, BUT SHE DOESN'T.
Jimmy: NO. SHE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ANYBODY?
WE MET STEVE CARRELL AND I WAS LIKE "HI, STEVE, I'M A BIG FAN," WHATEVER, BLAH BLAH. AND HE SAID "OH YEAH, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, ANSEL, IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU" OR WHATEVER, WHICH WAS REALLY COOL. AND THEN WE TALKED FOR A LITTLE BIT AND MY MOM WAS THERE AND HE LEFT, I SAID "MOM, YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS, RIGHT? SHE SAID, "NO." [ LAUGHTER ] I SAID MOM THAT'S STEVE CARRELL. AND SHE SAID, "WHO IS THAT?" I SAID, " HE WAS IN 'THE OFFICE', HE -- 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN? THAT'S STEVE CARELL." "I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU WERE JUST SITTING THERE --
YEAH, MY MOM IS RIDICULOUS. WE WERE LIKE AT A PARTY WITH LITERALLY, BRUCE WILLIS THERE WITH HIS WIFE. AND MY DAD KNOWS BRUCE WILLIS'S WIFE, BECAUSE MY DAD'S A A PHOTOGRAPHER AND SHE'S A A MODEL. AND THEY WERE INTRODUCED AND MY MOM SAID, "OH, HI, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? HE SAID, "I'M BRUCE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE SAID "OH, WHAT DO YOU DO? YOUR WIFE'S A MODEL." [ LAUGHTER ] HE SAID "I'M AN ACTOR." SHE SAID "OH, MY SON'S AN ACTOR. HOW'S IT GOING FOR YOU?" AND HE SAID, "YEAH, IT'S GOING PRETTY GOOD." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S A GOOD GUY, RIGHT? THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER. MOM! IT'S BRUCE WILLIS!
I WAS LIKE DYING --
Jimmy: THAT SOUNDS LIKE MY MOM. IT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYONE'S MOM. IT'S SO GOOD. LET'S TALK YOU ABOUT THIS MOVIE. GOSH, IT'S GOING TO BE A GIANT MOVIE. THE OTHER ONE WAS LIKE $300 MILLION AT THE BOX -- IT'S JUST A GIANT PHENOMENON. YOU'VE GOT SHAILENE WOODLEY. OUR PAL, HOW IS SHE DOING?
SHE'S DOING GOOD.
Jimmy: I LOVE HER SO MUCH. MILES TELLER.
UH-HUH.
Jimmy: HE'S GREAT AS WELL AND NOW NAOMII WATTS IS BRAND NEW, RIGHT?
NAOMII WATTS, KATE WINSLET, IT'S ALL GOOD PEOPLE.
Jimmy: COME ON, THIS IS ALL GOOD PEOPLE. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS CHAPTER.
WELL, "INSURGENT" IS THE SEQUEL AND IT'S A LOT DARKER. I REALLY LIKE IT CAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE Y.A. MOVIES. SOMETIMES Y.A. FEEL, LIKE, WEIRD. THIS FEELS LIKE AN ACTION-ADVENTURE REAL MOVIE. IT'S DARKER. IN THIS MOVIE, MY CHARACTER WHO'S THE SIBLING OF THE MAIN CHARACTER, WE'RE ON THE RUN, WE'RE REBELS BASICALLY. AND -- BECAUSE THERE'S ONE FACTION THAT I CAME FROM CALLED ERUDITE THAT'S TRYING TO KEEP THE PEACE, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY THE PEACE. THEY ARE VERY MANIPULATIVE --
Jimmy: OH I KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE TRYING TO BASICALLY KILL MY SISTER AND THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL --
Jimmy: NOT COOL.
NO, BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL ME TOO AND MY GUY IS SORT A TRAITOR, BECAUSE HE'S NOT CUT OUT FOR IT. HE'S FROM ERUDITE. HE'S FROM THE INTELLIGENT FACTION, HE'S NOT PHYSICAL AND HE'S ON THE RUN AND HE REALIZES HE'S GOING TO PROBABLY DIE. SO HE BETRAYS --
Jimmy: DON'T GIVE IT ALL AWAY.
OKAY, OKAY -- [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HE BETRAYS HIS SISTER AND -- YOU KNOW, HE GOES BACK TO THE INTELLIGENCE FACTION. I DIDN'T GIVE IT ALL AWAY.
Jimmy: THE BOOKS EXISTS. THEY COULD JUST READ THE BOOKS. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S OUR PAL, ANSEL ELGORT IN "INSURGENT." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
I'M NOT COMING WITH YOU GUYS.
WHAT?
I'M NOT COMING WITH YOU GUYS.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA FIND THE REST OF THE -- THEN WHAT? YOU ATTACK ERUDITE, ASSASSINATE JANINE, START A CIVIL WAR?
