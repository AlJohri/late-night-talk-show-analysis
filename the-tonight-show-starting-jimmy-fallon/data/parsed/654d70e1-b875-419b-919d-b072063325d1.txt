THE OPENING OF "STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS" WAS TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BIG DEAL. GET THIS, I READ THAT A FAN PAID HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR A RARE COLLECTION OF "STAR WARS" TOYS AT AN AUCTION YESTERDAY IN NEW YORK CITY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED IF HE WAS GOING TO SEE THE NEW "STAR WARS" MOVIE TONIGHT THE MAN WAS LIKE, CAN I BORROW 12 BUCKS? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I JUST SPENT HALF A MILLION ON TOYS. AND IN AN INTERVIEW THIS WEEK, AT THE PREMIERE OF "STAR WARS" ONE OF THE STARS, OSCAR ISAAC, SAID THAT HE WOULD LEAVE EARTH FOREVER IF HE COULD TAKE A A FAMILY MEMBER. [ LAUGHTER ] OR AS MOST PEOPLE CALL THAT, DEFEATING THE PURPOSE OF LEAVING EARTH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S LIKE, NO, YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT. YOU GET AWAY FROM EVERYBODY.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CAN WE GET THAT? I'M SORRY. WELL, GUYS, HERE'S THE LATEST ON THE ELECTION. A NEW NATIONAL POLL FOUND THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS NOW MORE THAN 30 POINTS AHEAD OF BERNIE SANDERS AMONG DEMOCRATIC VOTERS. YEP. I DON'T WANT TO SAY HILLARY IS OVERCONFIDENT, BUT AT HER LAST RALLY SHE JUST STOOD BEHIND THE PODIUM AND DRANK CHAMPAGNE. SHE WAS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I GOT THIS, I GOT THIS. I SAW THAT HILLARY SPOKE IN NEBRASKA YESTERDAY AND ASKED DEMOCRATS IN THE MIDWEST TO TELL REPUBLICANS THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE HORNS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN PEOPLE SAID, "OH, DON'T WORRY, WE KNOW WHICH CLINTON IS THE HORNY ONE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY! HO! HEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

THOUGH IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE STUDY'S MARGIN OF ERROR, THE FACT THAT NO TEEN IS GOING TO TELL YOU IF THEY'RE DRINKING OR SMOKING OR DOING DRUGS. [ APPLAUSE ] ARE YOU A COP? THAT'S RIGHT, TEENS ARE LESS LIKELY TO DRINK, SMOKE OR USE DRUGS THAN THEY USED TO BE. KIDS WERE LIKE, "WE DON'T WANNA GET ADDICTED TO STUFF." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FINALLY, A LOCAL STORY HERE. $10 MILLION IN DIAMONDS WERE REPORTED STOLEN BY A JEWELER HERE IN NEW YORK CITY BUT IT TURNS OUT THEY WERE JUST THROWN OUT BY ACCIDENT. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] MEANWHILE, OSCAR THE GROUCH JUST BOUGHT SESAME STREET. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE WAS LIKE, "YES! WHO LIVES IN A TRASH CAN NOW?" WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS.

I LEARNED. I WAS UP ALL NIGHT. AND I HAD TO SING, AND I'D NEVER SUNG BEFORE. AND I GOT THROUGH IT. IT WAS CALLED "THE LIFE OF THE PARTY." AND THE DIRECTOR, I SAID, "I'M VERY NERVOUS." HE SAID, "NO, YOU WERE GREAT. YOU WERE GREAT." AND I GOT THROUGH IT SWEATING. HE SAID, "THAT'S GREAT. AND WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?" I SAID, "I HAVE NO IDEA." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I HAD FORGOTTEN MY NAME, BUT THE WORST PART, THE WORST PART IS I THOUGHT -- I KNEW IT STARTED WITH A "J" SO I KEPT GOING "J-J-J. NO, WAIT, WAIT, J-J." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY LET ME GO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T GET IT, WELL BUT MAYBE --
I DIDN'T GET THAT ROLE.
Jimmy: MAYBE THEY THOUGHT YOU WERE FRENCH OR SOMETHING. "J-J-J." [ MUMBLING IN FRENCH ]
