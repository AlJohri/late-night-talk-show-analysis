Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. WERE YOU IN -- WERE YOU IN THE MOVIE AT ALL, OR NO?
NO, I DIDN'T GET IN THE MOVIE, MAN. I ACTUALLY ENDED UP MOVING TO FLORIDA LIKE, THE YEAR -- THE YEAR THEY CAST THE MOVIE AND STARTED THE PRODUCTION. SO, I MISSED OUT ON THE WHOLE THING. AND I SAW ALL MY CLASSMATES IN THE SHOW, IN THE FILM, DANCING AND MAKING MONEY AND I WAS GOING TO MY MOM'S SCHOOL IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA.
Jimmy: DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU LOST OUT AND YOU GO, "OH THAT'S IT. IT'S OVER FOR ME? THAT WAS YOUR BIG OPPORTUNITY, MOM."

Jimmy: YEAH, AT LUNCH TIME YOU'D HAVE DANCE -- AND WHAT TYPE OF DANCE?
ANYTHING. YOU HAD BALLET, YOU HAD THE BALLET KIDS, YOU HAD THE TAPPING KIDS, YOU HAD THE STREET KIDS, THE HIP-HOP KIDS. AND THEY PLAYED A GAME CALLED SIGNS. SO, SIGNS WAS LIKE EIGHT COUNTS, YOU COULD DO A A MOVEMENT. YOU HAD EIGHT COUNTS TO DO WHATEVER MOVEMENT YOU WANTED. POP POP POP-POP POP POP BAM. RIGHT? EVERYBODY HAD THEIR OWN PARTICULAR DANCE. AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO MIMIC THEIR DANCE AND PASS OFF. IF YOU PASSED OFF TO SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN DANCE, THEY GOT KICKED OUT OF THE GAME, GOT KICKED OUT OF THE CIRCLE.
Jimmy: REALLY? THAT'S A TOUGH GAME.
IT'S FUN, MAN.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT.
THAT'S HOW YOU MEET THE GIRLS, MAN.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE.
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: BUT I DIDN'T SEE YOU -- I DIDN'T SEE YOU DANCING IN MICHAEL JACKSON, IN "BAD." IN THE VIDEO "BAD."
NO, YEAH. NO, 'CAUSE I AUDITIONED -- I AUDITIONED AS A -- YEAH, THAT WAS A MOMENT BACK IN THE DAY.
Jimmy: LOOK AT THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT WAS GREAT.
YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I'M ON THE WRONG SIDE.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT. YEAH. HOW WAS -- HOW'D YOU GET INVOLVED WITH THAT, WITH MICHAEL?
I AUDITIONED FOR SCORSESE AND Q., QUINCY JONES AND THEY -- THEY SELECTED ME OUT OF, I DON'T KNOW, MANY OF HUNDREDS OF GUYS WHO AUDITIONED.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. AND HOW WAS MICHAEL? I GOT TO MEET HIM QUICKLY ONCE.
MICHAEL, MICHAEL, THE GREAT MICHAEL. AN INSPIRATION TO MUSIC. MICHAEL WAS VERY INTERESTING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
VERY, VERY INTERESTING.
Jimmy: HE REALLY WAS.
HE ACTUALLY WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS WITH FILMING IN HARLEM, BECAUSE WE FILMED SOME OF THE "BAD" VIDEO RIGHT THERE IN HARLEM. IRONICALLY ON THE SAME BLOCK WE FILMED SOME OF THE "NEW JACK CITY."
Jimmy: REALLY?
HE WAS NERVOUS, 'CAUSE THE FANS WERE A LITTLE AMBIVALENT WITH HIM. SOME OF THEM LOVED HIM. SOME OF THEM HATED HIM. SO, YOU'D HEAR THEM LITERALLY YELLING OUT, "MICHAEL JACKSON, WE LOVE YOU!" "OH MY GOD, MICHAEL JACKSON, I WANNA HAVE YOUR BABY, OH MY GOD!" YOU HAD OTHER PEOPLE GOING, "MICHAEL JACKSON, YOU AIN'T BEEP." MICHAEL JACKSON, YOU AIN'T NEVER COME BACK TO THE HOOD." "MICHAEL JACKSON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR US?" [ LAUGHTER ] "HELL WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!"
Jimmy: REALLY?
SO, MICHAEL TURNED TO ME AND HE'S LIKE, "ARE YOU SCARED?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I WAS LIKE, "YO, MIKE, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" "ARE YOU SCARED? I MEAN, ARE YOU SCARED?" I'M LIKE, "NO, MIKE, THIS IS HARLEM, BABY. THIS IS WHERE WE GREW UP. YOU KNOW THEY LOVE YOU. REALLY, ARE YOU SCARED?" HE'S LIKE "A LITTLE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO, YOU HELPED HIM OUT. YOU HELPED HIM THROUGH IT.

Jimmy: WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO. YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY "NO," TOO, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW.
I COULD NEVER SAY NO TO YOU, JIMMY.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, ABSOLUTELY. "THE PLAYER," EXPLAIN WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.
"THE PLAYER" IS KIND OF A A HIGH-CONCEPT DRAMA BUILT ON A A ROBUST ACTION PLATFORM. SO, IT'S CONSPIRATORIAL. AND IT'S A NAIL BITER.
Jimmy: AND IT'S SET IN VEGAS.
SET IN VEGAS. AND THE PREMISE IS THAT THERE ARE SUPER-WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AROUND THE WORLD WHO CREATE TWO THINGS. A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THEM TO PREDICT CRIME. AND ALSO A VIRTUAL CASINO THAT ALLOWS THE GAMBLERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BET ON THE OUTCOME OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
MY JOB IS THE PIT BOSS. I'M THE GUY WHO MAKES SURE, THE GAMBLERS STAY IN LINE, THE PLAYERS STAY IN LINE, THE DEALERS STAY IN LINE. AND WHEN ANYBODY GETS OUT OF LINE, YOU ALREADY KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T EVEN NEED TO SAY.
Jimmy: WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S WESLEY SNIPES IN "THE PLAYER."
IT AIN'T NOTHIN' NICE. IT AIN'T NOTHIN' NICE.
Jimmy: TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. "THE PLAYER", WESLEY SNIPES. CRIME, MR. CAIN. WE GAMBLE ON CRIME.
YOU GAMBLE WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES.
NO, HERE IN THE HOUSE, WE PREDICT CRIME. WE NEVER INFLUENCE IT.
DID YOU PREDICT THE KIDNAPPING? DID YOU PREDICT JIMMY'S DEATH? YOU COULD HAVE SAVED JIMMY.
DO NOT.
OH, THAT'S THE GAME. YOU DON'T HAVE A STRONG ENOUGH HAND. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
OH, JIMMY FALLON, YOU DON'T HAVE A STRONG ENOUGH HAND.
