Jimmy: THANK YOU! HEY! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THIS IS IT, "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] A HOT CROWD, GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT'S A LITTLE CONTROVERSY FOR -- A LITTLE CONTROVERSY FOR DONALD TRUMP. LITTLE CONTROVERSY HERE. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT TRUMP IS OVERSTATING HIS WEALTH BY MORE THAN $7 BILLION. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] BUT TRUMP HAS DENIED THE RUMORS SAYING, "THAT IS A MILLION PERCENT UNTRUE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S RUMORED THAT TRUMP IS OVERSTATING HIS WEALTH BY MORE THAN $7 BILLION. SERIOUSLY? THE GUY HAS TWO EX-WIVES. YOU'D THINK HE'D GO THE OTHER WAY. HE'S LIKE, "I'M TOTALLY BROKE, I GOT NOTHING TO GIVE TO ANYONE. I HAVE NO MONEY. [ APPLAUSE ] I HAVE NOTHING AT ALL." TO BE FAIR, THOUGH, IT'S HARD TO TELL IF HE'S WAS JUST STATING HIS WEALTH OR HE JUST LIKES SAYING BIG NUMBERS.
A BILLION DOLLARS A DAY! A BILLION DOLLARS A DAY. $8,737,540,000. $1.3 TRILLION. $2 TRILLION. DO YOU KNOW WE'RE AT $18 TRILLION NOW. WE'RE SOON GONNA BE AT $20 TRILLION. $9,240,000,000. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: EVEN THE COUNT WAS LIKE, "THAT'S TOO MANY NUMBERS. HA HA HA HA HA! I DON'T LIKE IT. IT HURTS MY HEAD. HA HA HA HA HA! I WISH I LIKED COOKIES INSTEAD. HA HA HA HA HA. WRONG CHARACTER CHOICE. HA HA HA HA. RUBBER DUCKIES OR SOMETHING. HA HA HA HA. I JUST HAVE A BAD HEADACHE. HA HA HA. [ LAUGHTER ] TOO LOUD. HA HA HA." SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY, ANOTHER CANDIDATE COMES OUT OF THE WOOD WORK. IN FACT, THIS WEEK A MAN FROM IOWA WHOSE ACTUAL LEGAL NAME IS "DEEZ NUTS." [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪
Steve: WHAT WAS HIS NAME? WHAT WAS HIS LEGAL NAME?
Jimmy: THIS IS REAL. THIS IS REAL. THIS GUY, HE'S A MAN FROM IOWA, HIS ACTUAL LEGAL NAME IS "DEEZ NUTS." [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, AMERICANS LOOKED AT THE OTHER CANDIDATES AND SAID, "WELL, HE CAN'T BE WORSE THAN DOZE NUTS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Steve: HEY!
Jimmy: OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY IS THAT THE NFL UPHELD TOM BRADY'S FOUR-GAME SUSPENSION YESTERDAY AND SAID THE DECISION INVOLVED THE FACT THAT BRADY DESTROYED HIS CELL PHONE JUST BEFORE HE WAS INVESTIGATED. THEN HILLARY SAID, "YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DESTROY IT. JUST SWITCH THE SIM CARD -- I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW. BYE, GOT TO GO." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND EVERYONE'S REALLY UPSET ABOUT THIS AND RIGHTFULLY SO. APPARENTLY THIS DENTIST FROM MINNESOTA WENT ON ONE OF THOSE BIG GAME HUNTING TRIPS IN AFRICA AND THEY ENDED UP ILLEGALLY KILLING A PRETTY FAMOUS LION NAMED CECIL. SO MANY PEOPLE HATE THIS GUY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS CONSIDERING HIM AS A RUNNING MATE. [ LAUGHTER ] "THIS GUY IS THE WORST. HE'S PERFECT FOR WHAT MY CAMPAIGN IS DOING." THIS GUY IS SO UNPOPULAR THAT FOUR OUT OF FIVE OTHER DENTISTS THINK HE'S A DOUCHEBAG. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: THIS DENTIST FROM MINNESOTA ILLEGALLY SHOT A A FAMOUS LION AND APPARENTLY IS IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. HE BETTER HOPE HE STAYS OUT OF JAIL BECAUSE HE'D DEFINITELY GET HIS CAVITY FILLED. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AS A DENTIST.
Steve: HEY, HO! HEY, HO! HEY! HO! HEY, HEY, HEY!

SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN EP OR NOTHING COMING OUT." I GO, "IT DOESN'T MATTER. THAT'S THE FUN OF TV. THAT'S THE FUN OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

SHE'S SUPER COOL AND SUPER CUTE. AND SHE GOES -- SHE WAS HERE AT THE NBC TOUR ABOUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO, CAME, AND SHE REALLY WANTED TO SEE OUR STUDIO FOR WHEN WE DID "LATE NIGHT."

Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S THE PROBLEM. ONCE YOU'RE DONE, YOU'RE LIKE, "CAN WE MAKE A SEQUEL?" NO, YOU CAN'T. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
NO, NO IT'S TIME TO --
Jimmy: SO NOW HOW DID YOU LOSE THE WEIGHT? YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

Jimmy: ME, TOO.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT YEAR? DO YOU KNOW WHAT YEAR IT IS?
IT'S 1974. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE LIKE ME. I ALWAYS FEEL INFERIOR TO MEN WHO KNOW ABOUT CARS AND CAN TALK ABOUT IT. AND IT'S THE KIND OF CAR PEOPLE WANT TO TALK ABOUT. AND SO THEY SAY LIKE, "HEY WHAT KIND OF ENGINE'S IN THERE?" AND I SAY THINGS LIKE, "A GENTLEMEN NEVER TELLS." [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I HAVE NO -- I HAVE NO IDEA.
Jimmy: HIT THEM WITH A A RIDDLE, YEAH. YA HIT 'EM A GOOD RIDDLE AND GET OUT OF THERE, YEAH.

Jimmy: "A GENTLEMEN NEVER TELLS."
SO MY STARTER, THE STARTER, DOESN'T WORK, RIGHT?
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND SO THEY SHOWED ME AT THE PLACE WHERE THEY FIX THE CAR THAT IF YOU --
Jimmy: GARAGE?
YEAH, GARAGE, SURE.
Jimmy: OKAY, SURE.
SO, THEY SHOWED ME HOW TO START THE CAR UNDER THE HOOD. AND I THOUGHT, "THIS IS A COOL, MANLY TRICK, YOU KNOW?"
Jimmy: YEAH.
YOU USE A SCREWDRIVER AND TOUCH THESE TWO CONTACTS AND THE CAR GOES. [ ENGINE REVVING ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO, I WAS AT THE GROCERY STORE AND I COME OUT AND THERE'S LIKE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WERE STANDING AROUND THE BRONCO LIKE, "HEY, WHAT KIND OF ENGINE IS IN THERE?"
Jimmy: YEAH.
"GENTLEMEN NEVER TELLS." AND I GO TO START THE CAR AND IT DOESN'T START. SO I'M ALREADY SUPER EMBARRASSED, BECAUSE THEY'RE WAITING TO HEAR WHAT THE ENGINE DOES. AND SO I WALK OUT AND THEY'RE LIKE OH, "GOT ENGINE TROUBLE, KID?" I'M LIKE, "YEAH." AND I GO, "BUT I KNOW SOME TRICKS."
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I GO AND I POP THE HOOD. AND I HAVE MY SCREWDRIVER --
Jimmy: OH THIS IS GREAT.
AND I TOUCH THE TWO CONTACTS AND, VROOM, THE ENGINE COMES TO LIFE. BUT IT TURNED OUT IT WASN'T A A PROBLEM WITH MY STARTER. I HAD LEFT THE CAR IN "DRIVE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO THE CAR COMES TO LIFE, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST STARTS COMING AT ME, RIGHT? IT'S LIKE LURKING AT ME. THIS IS 100% TRUE. AND SO I MADE AN INSTINCTIVE DECISION, THERE WASN'T A A THOUGHT BEHIND IT, I JUST THOUGHT, "I'M GOING TO STOP THIS BRONCO." AND SO I LIKE -- GET IN, I REAR UP, AND I START WRESTLING IT. AND IT'S SO MUCH BIGGER THAN ME.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. IT'S A GIANT TRUCK.
IT'S LIKE PUSHING ME BACK AND EVERYONE AROUND IS LIKE, "WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE MUPPET GUY DIE." [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: WHO IS A FANTASTIC AUTHOR. IF YOU KNOW, I KNOW "CONSIDER THE LOBSTER."

Jimmy: HAVE YOU READ EVER THAT ONE?
I READ IT FOR THE MOVIE, YEAH. I MEAN IT'S REALLY HARD TO TACKLE. I LUCKILY -- I HAD SOME DUDES AT MY BOOKSTORE, MY LOCAL BOOKSTORE WHEN I BOUGHT IT, I ASKED THEM, "HOW LONG SHOULD I GIVE MYSELF TO READ THIS?" AND THEY WERE LIKE, "FIRST TIME?" AND I SAID, "YEAH, FIRST TIME." AND THEY SAID, "WELL, WE DO A A BOOK CLUB IF YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN US." AND EVERY SUNDAY, I WOULD GET TOGETHER WITH THESE THREE GROWN MEN AND WE WOULD TALK ABOUT THIS BOOK AND, LIKE, EAT BURRITOS. AND IT WAS --
Jimmy: WELL, HOW WOULD YOU DO IT?
WE WOULD READ 100 PAGES ON OUR OWN AND THEN GET TOGETHER ON SUNDAYS AND TALK ABOUT IT. BUT WHAT REALLY -- TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE, WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME WAS THE BOOK IS REALLY SPECIAL I THINK FOR PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN AGE. YOU'RE SORT OF TOLD WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG, IF YOU JUST ACHIEVE THIS STUFF, YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL GOOD.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND YOU REACH A CERTAIN AGE WHERE YOU REALIZE, "OH I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET 'THERE' AND I'M STARTING TO THINK THERE'S NO 'THERE.'" LIKE, THIS JUST GOES ON FOREVER AND I BETTER MAKE FRIENDS WITH LIFE. AND SO, IT WAS LIKE FOUR DUDES TALKING ABOUT THAT. AND IT SAID A LOT ABOUT DAVID FOSTER WALLACE TO ME, THAT HE COULD DO THAT.
Jimmy: WOW, FANTASTIC.
IT WAS REALLY GREAT. I FELT REALLY LUCKY. I JUST FEEL REALLY LUCKY. I'M AWARE THAT WHEN THAT SCRIPT COMES ACROSS SOMEONE'S DESK, "LIKE HERE'S THE DAVID FOSTER WALLACE SCRIPT", IT'S NOT LIKE SOMEBODY KNOCKS DOWN A DRINK AND SAYS, "GET JASON SEGEL ON THE PHONE!" [ LAUGHTER ]
