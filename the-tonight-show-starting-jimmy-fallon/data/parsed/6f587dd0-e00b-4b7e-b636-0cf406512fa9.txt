WINNING, LOSING, WORKING.
Jimmy: EVERYTHING. YOUR WHOLE LIFE. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. THEN AT THE END OF YOUR CAREER, THINGS KIND OF DIDN'T END PERFECTLY. YOU ENDED UP GOING TO, YOU KNOW, IT HAPPENS. YOU ENDED UP PLAYING FOR THE RIVAL TEAM WHICH HAPPENS SOMETIMES. BUT YOU WENT BACK TO YOUR HOME AND YOU WEREN'T WELL RECEIVED.
WHICH IS PROBABLY AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
Jimmy: OKAY, YEAH, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NOW HERE YOU ARE. NOW IT'S WHAT, FIVE YEARS LATER?
ALMOST FIVE YEARS, YEAH.
Jimmy: ALMOST FIVE YEARS AND THEY'RE RETIRING YOUR JERSEY. THIS IS THE MOST EMOTIONAL THING. YOU GO BACK TO LAMBEAU FIELD.
YOU KNOW --
Jimmy: WERE YOU NERVOUS?
I WAS VERY NERVOUS. AND IT WAS TWO OCCASIONS. JULY, WENT UP TO REALLY THE FIRST TIME I HAD BEEN BACK. AND THE HALL OF FAME CEREMONY, AND THEN COME BACK, WHICH WAS LAST WEEK FOR RETIREMENT OF THE JERSEY. I WAS A LOT MORE NERVOUS IN JULY BEING THE FIRST TIME BACK. I ASSUMED THAT I WOULD BE WELL RECEIVED, BUT YOU JUST DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
AND 70,000 SHOWED UP TO HEAR ME TALK AND BE INDUCTED INTO THE HALL OF FAME.
Jimmy: YES.
I WAS EXTREMELY HONORED BY THAT. AND OF COURSE, AT THE GAME THE OTHER NIGHT, THERE WERE 80,000 BECAUSE THERE IS GOING TO BE 80,000 AT THE GAME BECAUSE THEY SELL OUT EVERY GAME. BUT IT WAS -- THE ICE HAD BEEN BROKEN. BUT IT STILL HAD AN AMAZING FEEL. IT FELT LIKE HOME AGAIN, BECAUSE AS I JOKINGLY SAID AT THE HALL OF FAME CEREMONY WHEN I WAS SPEAKING TO THE CROWD, THE LAST TIME I WAS AT THIS STADIUM, I CAME WALKING OUT OF THE VISITOR TUNNEL, AND IT WAS A LOT DIFFERENT. THEY WERE GIVING ME A LOT OF NUMBER ONE SIGNS, BUT IT WAS NOT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP. WE HAVE A CLIP OF "FAVRE RETURNS." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
I'M SO MUCH BETTER GOING OUT THERE IN A FOOTBALL UNIFORM. GOOD THING I'M NOT WEARING WHITE PANTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, QUARTERBACK FROM SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI, MR. FAVRE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: COME ON RIGHT THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THERE'S NO GAME THAT DAY. JUST THERE FOR YOU.
YOU KNOW, DRIVING THROUGH THE STADIUM THAT DAY, IT WAS LIKE WHO ARE THEY PLAYING TODAY?
Jimmy: YEAH.
THEY WERE TAILGATING. IT WAS AWESOME.
Jimmy: THERE'S NO GAME. THEY'RE JUST THERE FOR YOU.
NO PLACE LIKE GREEN BAY. THERE REALLY ISN'T.
Jimmy: OH MY GOD, NO. EXCEPT FOR NEW YORK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT BESIDES THAT, THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE GREEN BAY.
THERE'S 100,000 PEOPLE, BUT YES.
Jimmy: PLEASE. LOOK, WE LOVE TO PLAY GAMES ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW." I HAVE THE PERFECT GAME FOR YOU. OKAY, YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARMS IN NFL HISTORY. SO TONIGHT, WE'RE DOING A GAME CALLED THE TONIGHT SHOW THROWDOWN. HERE WE GO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE THIS FOR YOU HERE. WE HAVE THIS. YOU LOOK VERY COOL WEARING THESE. MAYBE PUT THIS ON FIRST.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: WE HAVE PACKERS FOR YOU. AND FOR ME, WE HAVE -- WE GOT THE JETS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO HERE'S THE DEAL. HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK. WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER THERE. I'M GOING TO THROW SOME PLATES IN THE AIR.
OKAY.
Jimmy: AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A THROWDOWN. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HOW MANY PLATES YOU CAN SMASH, OKAY? NOW HERE'S THE DEAL. WE DID THIS ONCE BEFORE WITH DREW BREES. AND HE HOLDS THE RECORD.
REALLY? A MUCH MORE ACCURATE PASSER THAN ME, BY THE WAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I THROW IT HARDER.
Jimmy: YEAH, OKAY. OH, YOU DO? MAYBE I SHOULD GET SOME -- MAYBE YOU SHOULD -- CAN WE GET AN INTERN TO THROW THE PLATES? [ LAUGHTER ] ARE THE KID INVENTORS STILL HERE? [ LAUGHTER ] THEY WANT TO -- ALL RIGHT, BRETT, ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?
NO. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVEN'T THROWN IN FIVE YEARS.
Jimmy: THIS IS EXCITING. OKAY, HERE WE GO. NOW, I'M GOING TO TOSS THE PLATE. DO YOU WANT TO PRACTICE ONE OR NO?
YEAH, GIVE IT A PRACTICE.
Jimmy: DON'T LOOK AT IT YET. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] LET ME THROW IT FIRST. READY? ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
IT BROKE.
Jimmy: THAT WAS THE PRACTICE. IT BROKE BECAUSE IT FELL ON THE GROUND, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I'LL THROW IT HIGHER IN THE AIR. READY?
HIGHER, PLEASE.
Jimmy: READY FOR THIS?
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I'M NOT USED TO THROWING.
THAT WAS A BAD THROW.
Jimmy: THANK GOD I MOVED OUT OF THE WAY --
BAD TOSS. BAD PLATE.
Jimmy: COME ON. CALM DOWN, BRETT. GOSH.
YOU WANTED TO GET HIT.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THROW THIS IN THE AIR. I'M AFRAID. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] READY? OH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S ONE. THAT'S ONE. WE GOT ONE. WE GOT ONE. WE GOT ONE. WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE MORE. YOU HAVE ONE MORE FOOTBALL? HERE WE GO. ONE MORE. LAST ONE HERE. READY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU, BUDDY. ONE OF THE GREATEST FOOTBALL PLAYERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GAME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FUTURE NFL HALL OF FAMER, BRETT FAVRE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE GOT STAND-UP FROM LENNY CLARKE AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. ♪♪
Jimmy: WE'RE JOINED RIGHT NOW BY A VERY FUNNY COMEDIAN, ON DECEMBER 9th, YOU CAN SEE HIM PERFORMING AT GIGGLES COMEDY CLUB IN SAUGUS, MASSACHUSETTS. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ONE AND ONLY LENNY CLARKE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, THE HOLIDAYS ARE HERE. I'M OFFICIALLY A WRECK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT TRAVEL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'M WORRIED ABOUT FOOD. I USED TO BE A REALLY BIG FAT GUY. I WENT ON A DIET AND LOST 180 POUNDS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, THAT'S SO NICE. BUT IF YOU ALL DON'T CLAP, IT DOESN'T MEAN THE THING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I CAN LOOK BACK AND SEE MYSELF LAYING ON THE COUCH, WATCHING FOOTBALL ON TV, EATING CRACKED CRAB ON MY BELLY LIKE AN OTTER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND ALL I HAD ON WAS BOXER SHORTS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND THAT WAS JUST USING THEM FOR A NAPKIN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I KNOW, I'M SORRY, LADIES. I KNOW THAT'S A VISUAL YOU COULD HAVE FOR A LIFETIME, BUT I'LL BE PUTTING IT OUT THERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT MY PSYCHIATRIST SAID I SHOULD BE MORE OPEN AND HONEST. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] COURT ORDERED. [ LAUGHTER ] MY WIFE COMES WALKING IN, HONEY, DO I LOOK FAT? I WENT, NOT TO ME. [ LAUGHTER ] GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE TV. I GOT MONEY ON THIS GAME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SHE SAID, "WELL, DO YOU STILL FIND ME ATTRACTIVE?" I SAID, "IF I COULD STAND UNDER MY OWN POWER, I WOULD HAVE SEX WITH YOU RIGHT NOW." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHERE'S MY REACHING STICK? OH, I WAS BAD. SOMETIMES DURING MAKING LOVE, I WOULD FAKE AN ORGASM JUST SO I COULD FINISH MY SANDWICH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I GOT REALLY BIG. I TOPPED OUT AT 388 POUNDS. YEAH. I CAN REMEMBER HER LOOKING ME IN THE EYE AND SAYING, "YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD REALLY START HAVING SEX WITH OTHER PEOPLE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I WORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT I WORRY ABOUT RIGHT NOW? THIS GLOBAL WARMING. EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND. GLOBAL WARMING. I FEEL LIKE IT'S MY FAULT. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID GLOBAL WARMING IS THE BIGGEST THREAT WE HAVE IN OUR IMMEDIATE FUTURE. MR. PRESIDENT, HAVE YOU SEEN THE TV LATELY? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, WE GOT LOTS OF PROBLEMS. LAST YEAR IN BOSTON, WE HAD THE WORST WINTER IN THE HISTORY OF WINTERS. WE HAD SNOW UP TO THE THIRD-FLOOR WINDOWS. PETS, KIDS, SMALL THINGS WERE DISAPPEARING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH, WE WEREN'T SHOVELING SIDEWALKS. WE WERE SHOVELING ROOFS. AND PEOPLE STARTED CALLING FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY, IS IT STILL SNOWING IN BOSTON? OH, YEAH, I ONLY MADE IT TO THE PHONE BECAUSE WE'RE SHOVELING IN SHIFTS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I TELL YOU WHAT, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU KNOW, WE HAD SO MUCH PROBLEMS. EVERYONE WAS SAYING THE SAME THING. WELL, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE SNOW, IT'S JUST WE HAVE NO PLACE TO PUT IT. YEAH, WE DO. THROW IT IN THE OCEAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT WE DID WHEN I WAS A A KID. WE WOULD BACK UP TRUCKS, DUMP IT IN THE OCEAN, IT DISAPPEARS. PLENTY OF PARKING FOR EVERYONE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] NOW, YOU GOT THESE ENVIRONMENTAL WACKOS LIKE THE DIRTY PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE ALL-NATURAL FOOD CO-OPS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] EAT CLEAN FOOD, EAT CLEAN FOOD. YOU EVER BEEN IN THERE? I WALKED IN THERE, IT WAS DISGUSTING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THESE PEOPLE HAD MATTED HAIR, STAINS ON THEIR SHIRT, DIRTY FINGERNAILS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL ME A PINT OF BLUEBERRIES FOR $80. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] $80, WHAT DO YOU GET IN IT? THE BODY OF CHRIST? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE ALL SAYING THE SAME THING. YOU CAN'T THROW THE SNOW IN THE OCEAN. I SAID WHY NOT? BECAUSE ALL THE SALT AND THE SAND. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK IS IN THE OCEAN? [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] WELL, YOU HAVE TO LET IT MELT, ORGANICALLY GO IN THE SOIL. WHERE DO THE SEWERS GO SICK GIPPY? IN THE OCEAN. [ LAUGHTER ] IT GOT SO BAD LAST YEAR IN BOSTON, WE HAD TO CLOSE THE SUBWAY. NOT THE SANDWICH SHOP, THE ACTUAL SUBWAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, I'VE BEEN ON YOUR SUBWAYS AND I'LL GIVE YOU, YOU GOT SOME INTERESTING CHARACTERS, BUT IN BOSTON, WE HAVE GOT AN ENTIRE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF ANIMAL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I GET ON THE TRAIN, THE DOORS CLOSED. I LOOKED AROUND AND I WENT, OH, MY GOD. I'M THE BEST LOOKING PERSON ON THIS TRAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S A DOLLAR. DON'T TOUCH ME. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU PEOPLE ARE SO NICE. I'M LOOKING AT A COUPLE OF YOU. YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME LIKE DOGS WATCHING TV. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU ARE HAVING FUN, BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE WHY. [ LAUGHTER ] LET ME TELL YOU, I WOULD HAVE BEEN A GENIUS IF IT WASN'T FOR ALL THE LEAD PAINT I HAD AS A A BABY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MY MOTHER WOULD PUT ME BY THE WINDOWSILL AND SAY, CHEW, BOY, CHEW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WATCH THE SQUIRRELS. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET THE WRONG IDEA. I'M A GOOD FRIEND OF JIMMY'S. I DON'T WANT TO LET HIM DOWN. I DON'T WANT YOU TO -- JUST BECAUSE I DID A COUPLE ANIMAL JOKES, I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAS SEX WITH ANIMALS. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER HAD SEX WITH AN ANIMAL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT IF I DID, I WOULD HAVE SEX WITH A HORSE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAY, WHEN YOU'RE DONE, YOU GET A RIDE HOME. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THANKS SO MUCH. YOU'RE THE BEST. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
