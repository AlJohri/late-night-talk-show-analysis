IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. I CAN'T -- I KEEP CHECKING IT AND THINKING IT'S WRONG. I'M LIKE --
Jimmy: REFRESH, REFRESH. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE FIRST SOLO ALBUM.
I KNOW. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. AND IT TOOK A WHILE TO MAKE IT. AND, FOR A WHILE, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST LIKE MY PERSONAL ALBUM THAT I MADE FOR MYSELF TO JUST LISTEN TO IN MY CAR. AND LIKE PLAY FOR MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
Jimmy: HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THIS?
HI, LEA!
HI. [ CHEERS ] I FINISHED IT IN JUNE. AND I STARTED RECORDING IT IN 2012.
Jimmy: WOW.
YEAH, IN LIKE EARLY 2012.
Jimmy: DON'T YOU GET NERVOUS. LIKE, IF SOMEONE ELSE CAME OUT WITH A SONG THAT KINDA SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WROTE. LIKE "OH, MY GOSH."
WELL, I REALLY TRIED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SONGS WERE UNIQUE. AND THAT THEY SOUNDED LIKE ME SO THAT STUFF LIKE THAT HOPEFULLY WOULDN'T HAPPEN.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH ABSOLUTELY. I DON'T WANT TO SAY I PREDICTED IT. BUT AS SOON AS I HEARD THE SONG I THOUGHT, "OH, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLY GREAT." BECAUSE YOU LEAKED A SONG. IT WAS FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: WHOEVER DID THE COVER ART. I MEAN THAT'S JUST PERFECT RIGHT THERE. THAT'S A PERFECT FIRST ALBUM.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: MY ALBUM -- DO I EVEN HAVE AN ALBUM?
OH, LET ME SEE.
Jimmy: I DON'T HAVE MY ALBUM OUT HERE. NO, I DON'T EVEN HAVE IT OUT THERE. NORMALLY, I HAVE IT OUT HERE.
MY DAD MENTIONED LAST NIGHT THAT HE THINKS THAT YOU HAVE A A GREAT VOICE.
Jimmy: YOUR DAD DID?
YES. HE SAID HE THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE THE BEST HOST EVER BECAUSE NUMBER ONE, YOU'RE FUNNY. NUMBER TWO, YOU ARE UNIQUE, AND NUMBER THREE, YOU HAVE A GREAT VOICE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. WAIT FOR MY ALBUM, IT'S CALLED "EVEN LOUDER."
"EVEN LOUDER!"
Jimmy: IT'S "EVEN LOUDER." YEAH, IT'S COMING OUT NEXT YEAR.
I THINK THAT I SHOULD JUST MAKE MY SECOND ALBUM BE CALLED "EVEN LOUDER." AND THEN THE NEXT ONE BE LIKE MORE -- "EVEN MORE LOUDER."
Jimmy: AND THEN IT'S TOO LOUD -- A LITTLE TOO LOUD, THEN IT'S LOUDEST. ALL THE REMIXES --
I LOVE THAT. PERFECT.
Jimmy: IT IS GOOD. AND YOU'RE DOING THE WHOLE THING NOW. THE PRESS TOUR THAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
YES.
Jimmy: AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS, YOU'RE DOING A A CD SIGNING AT LIKE, A MALL.
YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO. I WOULD LOVE TO GO TO A MALL AND DO A MALL SIGNING.
WE DID A WHOLE MALL TOUR FOR "GLEE" WHEN THE SHOW FIRST STARTED. AND SO NOW, I'M DOING A MALL TOUR FOR MY RECORD, AND "GLEE" IS ON TONIGHT, BY THE WAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOTTA PROMOTE MY TV SHOW TOO.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. YOU GUYS HAVE A TIME MACHINE, GO BACK IN TIME, AND WATCH "GLEE."
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
Jimmy: NO BIG DEAL. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THIS 11:00 -- IT'S AFTER MIDNIGHT?
I'M SO TIRED.
Jimmy: I'M TIRED TOO. I'M SO TIRED. BUT, LET'S KEEP IT GOING, UP LATE. [ LAUGHTER ] "GLEE" WAS THE BEST ONE I'VE EVER SEEN. I COULDN'T EVEN BELIEVE -- WHAT IS IT NOW, 100 EPISODES?

Jimmy: AND A BUNCH OF GREAT GUEST STARS, YOU'VE GOT GWYNETH COMING BACK. KRISTIN CHENOWETH.
WE JUST SHOT A SCENE FOR OUR 100th EPISODE WHERE MYSELF AND GWYNETH WERE AT A CLUB AT LIKE, THREE IN THE MORNING. IN A FOAM PARTY UP TO HERE SINGING "MY GIRL WANTS TO PARTY ALL THE TIME" BY EDDIE MURPHY. AND IT WAS ONE OF THE CRAZIEST THINGS EVER. AND I'M LIKE, I'M DANCING IN FOAM WITH GWYNETH PALTROW.
Jimmy: THAT WASN'T THE SHOW. THAT WAS MY 40th BIRTHDAY PARTY. AND THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THAT.
-- I DIDN'T EVEN SEE YOU. YOU WERE, LIKE, COVERED IN FOAM LIKE CRAZY.
I KNOW. I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME. I INVITED YOU TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY, THEN I HIDE. I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO SEE ME.
Jimmy: WHAT'S THE SONG YOU'RE GONNA BE SINGING FOR US TONIGHT?
