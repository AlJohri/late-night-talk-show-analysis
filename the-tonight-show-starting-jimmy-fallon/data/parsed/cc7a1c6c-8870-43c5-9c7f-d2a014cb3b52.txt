IT WAS A BIG WEEK FOR ELECTION NEWS WITH TRUMP SECURING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT AND HILLARY CLINTON LOOKING LIKE SHE'S GOING BE TO THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. SO THAT MEANS IT'S TIME FOR BOTTLED GRUMP AND GLITTERY MITTENS.

I DID FINE THE FIRST, LIKE, FOUR SHOWS.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
IT WAS TOTALLY FINE. AND THEN, THE FIFTH SHOW, I WALKED OUT THERE, AND I WAS LIKE, YOU SAY LIKE, NOTHING, NOT A SINGLE -- LIKE, COULDN'T REMEMBER THE NEXT LINE, NOTHING. AND I USED TO MAKE FUN OF JOSH GAD SO HARD WHEN WE WERE DOING "THE BOOK OF MORMON" BECAUSE HE WOULD FORGET STUFF, AND I WOULD BE LIKE, "HAHAHA, LOSER." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I -- LIKE, IT HAD ALL CAME BACK TO ME BECAUSE I WAS --
Jimmy: WAIT, WHAT HAPPENED.
I MADE A BOLD AND MAYBE INCORRECT CHOICE THAT I KEPT MOVING MY LIPS SO I WAS LIKE, "MAYBE THEY'LL THINK MY MICROPHONE WENT OUT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT IS GENIUS.
NO, NOT GENIUS.
Jimmy: GENIUS.
NOT GENIUS.
Jimmy: NOT GENIUS?
NO, NO. I LOOKED LIKE A CRAZY PERSON. [ LAUGHTER ]

I WAS JUST LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE I WAS ON "TODDLERS AND TIARAS." I WAS JUST LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, FINALLY, ALEX LACAMOIRE, THE CONDUCTOR, LIKE, YELLED UP A LYRIC, AND I WAS LIKE, "THANK GOD." SO, I WAS BACK. IT WAS THE LONGEST, LIKE, EIGHT SECONDS OF MY LIFE.
Jimmy: OH, NO.
SO I JUST, LIKE, LOST ABOUT TEN YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BETWEEN THAT AND MADONNA STEALING MY SOUL, IT WAS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH.
ABOUT MY TIME.
Jimmy: YOU'RE FANTASTIC ON "GIRLS."
OH, THANKS.
Jimmy: I ALWAYS JUST SAY THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ESPECIALLY THIS SEASON.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: GOOD, WELL DONE. AND NOW, YOU'RE GEARING UP FOR A REVIVAL OF "FALSETTOS."
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS GONNA BE EXCITING.
NOT UNTIL THE FALL, BUT I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT IT. WE START REHEARSALS IN AUGUST. WE START PREVIEWS IN SEPTEMBER, BUT IT'S A SHOW THAT HASN'T EVER BEEN REVIVED. IT WAS ON BROADWAY IN 1992, AND THAT WON THE TONY. AND I WAS A HUGE FAN OF IT AS A A KID, AND JUST, I'M BEEN SUPER EXCITED TO GET TO DO IT.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO COME BACK, THEN, IN THE FALL WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT, OR WE'LL COME TO YOU.
I JUST, LIKE, CIRCLE THE BLOCK. I'D RATHER JUST WAIT FOR YOU TO CALL ME.
