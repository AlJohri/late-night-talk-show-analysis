[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. LIVE, FROM NEW YORK CITY. LET'S GET TO SOME ELECTION NEWS HERE. DURING A RECENT SPEECH, MIKE HUCKABEE SAID THAT HE'S THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS FOUGHT THE CLINTON POLITICAL MACHINE AND WON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "YOU SURE ABOUT THAT," SAID PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK I -- [ APPLAUSE ] -- WON TOO. THAT'S RIGHT, MIKE HUCKABEE SAYS HE'S THE ONLY PERSON THAT HAS FOUGHT THE CLINTON POLITICAL MACHINE AND WON. AS OPPOSED TO THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE, BERNIE SANDERS, WHO IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO FOUGHT A A FAX MACHINE AND LOST. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHERE DO YOU PUT THE GAS? THIS IS PRETTY BIG. YESTERDAY, JEB BUSH NAMED A A STAFFER FROM JOHN McCAIN'S 2008 CAMPAIGN, DANNY DIAZ, AS HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER. WHEN ASKED HOW HIS JOB WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN McCAIN, DIAZ SAID, "I NO LONGER HAVE TO -- I NO LONGER HAVE TO YELL. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE." THAT'S A MAJOR DIFFERENCE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE DOESN'T HAVE TO YELL. DON'T EAT THAT, JOHN! [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT DURING A RECENT SPEECH, MARCO RUBIO ADDRESSED CRITICISMS HE'S TOO YOUNG TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HE SAID HE'S BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT DOESN'T WORK. WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONVINCING IF HIS VOICE HADN'T CHANGED RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ WHEN IT'S TIME TO CHANGE YOU'VE GOT TO REARRANGE ♪ ♪ GROOVIN' ON UP IS WHAT -- SHA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA ♪ I DON'T KNOW WHO GOT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GUYS KNOW "THE BRADY BUNCH," RIGHT? OKAY, GOOD. LISTEN TO THIS, GUYS. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID DESPITE ANY CONFLICTS, THE WEST HAS NO NEED TO BE AFRAID OF RUSSIA. YEAH. ALTHOUGH KEEP IN MIND, PUTIN SAID THAT AS HE WAS PETTING A A TANK. [ LAUGHTER ] WHO IS A GOOD TANK? YOU ARE. YOU ARE GOOD TANK. HEY, I WANT TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO KANYE WEST WHO TURNED 38 YEARS OLD YESTERDAY. AND GET THIS, TO CELEBRATE, KIM KARDASHIAN RENTED OUT THE ENTIRE STAPLES CENTER SO HE AND HIS FRIENDS COULD PLAY BASKETBALL. COMPLETE WITH REAL REFS, ANNOUNCERS AND AN EMPTY STAPLES ARENA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO, JUST LIKE A REAL LAKERS GAME. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY-O! HEY! HEY, FORGET ABOUT IT!
Jimmy: SOME MORE CELEBRITY NEWS. I SAW THAT BRAD PITT, ANGELINA JOLIE, AND THEIR FAMILY WERE RECENTLY PHOTOGRAPHED SITTING IN COACH ON A FLIGHT FROM PARIS. YEAH. BRAD AND ANGELINA DIDN'T MIND FLYING COACH, BUT THEY DID GET ANNOYED WHEN THEY WERE ASKED TO CHECK SOME OF THEIR CARRY-ON CHILDREN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT WAS RUDE. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. THEY SHOULDN'T DO THAT.
Steve: THEY SHOULDN'T DO THAT. THAT'S RUDE.
Jimmy: AND THIS IS NOT GOOD. I HEARD THAT SUPER MODEL KATE MOSS WAS RECENTLY ESCORTED OFF A PLANE DURING A FLIGHT TO LONDON FOR BEING DISRUPTIVE.

Kamal: THAT'S RIGHT! THAT'S AN AIRPLANE FAUX PAS! I DON'T WANT YOUR BACK ALL UP IN MY FRONT! AIRPLANE FAUX PAS! [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ELSE?
Jimmy: WHEN PEOPLE BOARD AHEAD OF THEIR GROUP NUMBER.
Kamal: GOOD POINT. WAIT YOUR TURN, DUMMY! YOU KNOW HOW TO COUNT!

Jimmy: AND IT'S ONE OF THE CUTEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN. 'CAUSE I THOUGHT, I MEAN, DOES HE HAVE THE COURAGE. HOW OLD IS HE?
HE'S 10-YEARS-OLD.
Jimmy: I WOULD BE SO NERVOUS AT 10-YEARS-OLD TO DO LIP SYNC IN FRONT OF PEOPLE. I LOVE THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING IT AGAIN, NOW. LIKE THE LIP SYNC --
I THINK IT'S INSPIRED BY YOUR SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH. PEOPLE ARE DOING IT.
I'M TELLING YOU. I WAS SO NERVOUS, BECAUSE HE'S NOT A PERFORMER, AND HIS TEACHER, CANDACE ALLEN ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIP SYNC "UPTOWN FUNK", AND SO HE TOLD ME, "I'M GONNA SING IT IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL," AND I WAS LIKE A NERVOUS STAGE MOM. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO NERVOUS. 'CAUSE I'M THINKING, "DOES HE KNOW HOW HARD THAT IS TO GET UP IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL?" AND HE DID SUCH A GOOD JOB, JIMMY.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW A A CLIP, IF YOU DON'T MIND ME DOING THIS.
OKAY. OH, PLEASE!
Jimmy: IT'S FROM OUR EMAIL. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS LITTLE NOLAN DOING "UPTOWN FUNK." WATCH THIS. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE WAS LIKE, HE WENT FOR IT, MAN! I WAS SO HAPPY.
I KNOW. HE'S GOT SOME MOVES!
Jimmy: HOW DID HE FEEL?
HE'S GOT THE MOVES. HE FELT SO GOOD. AND THEN AFTER, HE'S IN FOURTH GRADE AND AFTER ALL THESE BIG EIGHTH GRADERS WERE, LIKE, CORNERED HIM. THEY WERE LIKE, "WE WERE WORSHIPPING YOU," AND HE HAD HIS LITTLE BRACES ON AND HE WAS LIKE, "THANKS." LIKE, SO EXCITED THAT THE GIRLS WERE COMING UP TO -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, SO CUTE. COME ON. WHAT DO -- DO YOU PLAY, YOU MUST PLAY FUN GAMES WITH THEM. AND, SO I AM SILLY, BECAUSE MY DAD WAS THAT WAY WITH ME. SO WE'LL PLAY SILLY GAMES LIKE TRUTH OR DARE.
Jimmy: WHAT'S TRUTH OR DARE?
LIKE, I'LL DARE THE KIDS TO DO STUFF. AND THEY THINK IT'S SO FUNNY. LIKE SILLY STUFF. LIKE NOLAN AND I WILL BE DRIVING TO SCHOOL AND I'LL BE LIKE, "I DARE YOU TO, SEE THAT MAN RIGHT THERE?" HE LOOKED KIND OF GROUCHY. AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO BE NICE THINGS. NEVER ANYTHING THAT WOULD HURT SOMEBODY'S FEELINGS. BUT, LIKE, I'LL DARE NOLAN -- LIKE SAY SOMETHING TO -- "I DARE YOU TO SAY TOP OF THE MORNING TO THAT MAN." SO HE'LL ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW AND BE LIKE "TOP MORNING TO YOU!" [ LAUGHTER ] SO STUPID.
Jimmy: HOW FUN.
OR WE'LL DO STUFF LIKE HE'LL ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW AND I'LL SAY LIKE I DARE YOU TO SCREAM OUT LIKE, "I LOVE APPLE JUICE." AND HE'LL BE LIKE, "I LOVE -- YO YO YO YO, I LOVE APPLE JUICE!" [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE REALLY LOUD.
Jimmy: COME ON.
OR I DARED MY DAUGHTER STELLA'S FRIEND CHELLA TO GO INTO THE COFFEE BEAN AND ASK IF THEY WERE ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE'S ONLY 11. AND THEY JUST GIGGLE.
Jimmy: COME ON. THAT'S A GREAT GAME. ALL RIGHT, I WANT TO PLAY THOSE.
I DARED MY SON TO GO INTO FLYWHEEL AND ASK IF THEY'RE, AND YOU KNOW MY SON IS LITTLE. TO ASK IF THERE WAS A A GENTLEMAN'S WORKOUT FOR A A LITTLE GENTLEMAN.
Jimmy: FLYWHEEL. YEAH. GENIUS. THAT'S STUFF I WOULD LOVE. HOW IS FRITZ DOING, YOUR HUSBAND?
HE'S DOING GREAT.
Jimmy: AN ARTIST, A A FANTASTIC ARTIST.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IS HE GOOD?
HE'S SO GOOD, JIMMY.
Jimmy: DOES HE GET ACTING AND ALL THAT STUFF, OR NO?
GOOD QUESTION. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE'S A A PAINTER, HE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ACTING WHEN WE FIRST DATED. BUT THEN WE'D BE WATCHING MOVIES TOGETHER AND I'D BE LIKE, "SHE IS SUCH A GOOD ACTRESS AND SHE'S SO GENUINE," AND I'D START POINTING OUT ACTING THINGS. AND NOW HE'S BECOME LIKE A REAL EXPERT, LIKE, ON ACTING. AND I'M LIKE, WELL I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD HIM TOO MUCH BECAUSE NOW MAYBE HE'LL LOOK AT MY ACTING AND THINK I'M KIND OF FAKEY, OR WHATEVER. SO BASICALLY, HE DOES A THING NOW WHERE HE NOTICE PEOPLE IN MOVIES, LIKE, WAKE UP IN A FAKE WAY, HE'S LIKE, "THAT SEEMED REALLY FAKE, REWIND THAT." AND WE'LL REWIND IT.
Jimmy: I KNOW WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT.
YOU DO?
Jimmy: OH, WHEN PEOPLE, YEAH, WHEN THEY WAKE UP.
YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, NO. THAT'S ONE OF THE OTHER GAMES, I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME WITH FRED ARMISEN.

Jimmy: WE'VE DONE THIS FOR AN HOUR.
YEAH. AGAIN, THIS IS HOW SAD MY LIFE IS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT FALLING ASLEEP AND THEN WAKING UP AND SEEING IF IT'S REAL OR NOT. WE WERE SITTING ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER ON A PLANE.
NO WAY.
Jimmy: LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT WAS GOOD. THAT WAS GOOD.
Jimmy: THAT WAS ALL RIGHT? NOW YOU DO ONE. YOU DO ONE.
I'M NOT THAT GOOD. STEVEN ROOT AND I JUST DID A A MOVIE TOGETHER, AND I WAS LIKE, "WE BETTER BE CAREFUL BECAUSE MY HUSBAND" -- THERE WAS A SCENE WHERE WE WERE SLEEPING AND HAD TO WAKE UP, AND I WAS LIKE, "MY HUSBAND IS GOING TO JUDGE OUR ACTING." WE WERE BOTH SO NERVOUS. WE WERE TRYING TO DO IT. 'CAUSE I HAD TO SLEEP AND THEN WAKE U THIS IS RID [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT, NO IT'S NOT. IT'S REALLY, REA IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO IT.
