Jimmy: AND FINALLY, THIS WEEKEND, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE, WHEN HE GAVE THE COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT LAKE AREA TECH IN SOUTH DAKOTA. THE PRESIDENT ONLY GETS TO DO THESE TYPES OF SPEECHES ONCE A A YEAR, AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR HE WAS A LITTLE RUSTY.
AND THERE ARE FEW COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT ARE AS IMPORTANT AS LAKE AREA TAKE -- TECH. BUT THEY'RE ALSO A GREAT PLACE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN THE WORK FORCE IN A A WHILE.

RIGHT, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: I HAVE A PHOTO -- HERE'S A PHOTO OF YOU. NOT TO EMBARRASS YOU, BUT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOU FOR SIX MINUTES. IF YOU DON'T MIND. LOOK AT THIS. YOU RECEIVED -- THIS IS THE HIGHEST CIVILIAN AWARD RIGHT HERE. THIS IS THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM.
YES. IT WAS VERY -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS.
IT WAS VERY TOUCHING. MY CHILDREN, MY GRANDCHILDREN WERE THERE. WE WERE EXCHANGING LOOKS. WHAT I WAS TERRIFIED ABOUT IS THAT SOME OF MY OLD COLLEGE PALS AND HIGH SCHOOL PALS WOULD STORM THE ROOM AND SAY "WAIT A A MINUTE."
Jimmy: YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE.
YEAH, RIGHT. NO, BUT I WAS VERY TOUCHED.
Jimmy: WERE YOU ALWAYS -- WERE YOU ALWAYS JUST HITTING IT OUT OF THE BOX? WERE YOU ALWAYS JUST HITTING HOMERS? WERE YOU EVER A SCREW UP? DID TOM BROKAW -- WAS HE EVER BAD TOMMY BROKAW OR LITTLE TOMMY BROKAW?
OLD TOMMY BROKAW UH -- WAS NOT AS INNOCENT AS HE APPEARED FROM TIME TO TIME. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
ACTUALLY, THINGS WENT VERY WELL. I WENT THROUGH HIGH -- I CAME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AS A WHIZ KID. AND THEN I COMPLETELY WENT OFF THE RAILS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. I THOUGHT BEER WAS FOOD AS A A MATTER OF FACT. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN FOR TWO YEARS, I WENT TO UNIVERSITY OF IOWA, BACK TO SOUTH DAKOTA, DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL EVEN, FOR A WHILE. AND UH -- CAN'T SAY I WAS HAVING THE GREATEST TIME IN THE WORLD, BUT I -- THERE WERE CERTAINLY NO RULES THAT I WAS PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO UNTIL A WOMAN THAT I HAD KNOWN SINCE WE WERE 15, WHO WAS KIND OF ALL EVERYTHING IN SOUTH DAKOTA. BY THEN SHE WAS MS. SOUTH DAKOTA. SHE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN IN OUR LITTLE CIRCLE. WROTE ME THE NASTIEST POSSIBLE LETTER YOU CAN IMAGINE SAYING, "DON'T SHOW UP ANY MORE. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU ANYMORE. NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE." AND IT WAS A BIG TURNAROUND FOR ME. I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IF MEREDITH CAN SEE THAT, AND WE WERE JUST FRIENDS AT THAT POINT. AND SO I TURNED MYSELF AROUND. SHE CAME TO ME AND SAID, "YOU KNOW, I WAS OUT OF LINE. I WENT TOO FAR." AND I SAID NO, I HAD IT COMING AND NINE MONTHS LATER WE GOT MARRIED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO, THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
Jimmy: NO WAY, THAT'S FANTASTIC! I LOVE THAT STORY. YOU DID -- YOU CERTAINLY DID TURN AROUND. YOU KNOW WE LOVE YOU HERE. AND UH, THIS BOOK, "A LUCKY LIFE INTERRUPTED," YOU HAD A A PRETTY SCARY COUPLE YEARS. PRETTY --
I DID. I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING GO WRONG IN MY LIFE. EVERYTHING HAS GONE -- MY FRIENDS WOULD ALWAYS SAY BROKAW'S LUCKY STAR JUST FOLLOWS HIM AROUND. YOU KNOW, MARRIED THE WOMAN I LOVED MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD 52 YEARS AGO. WE HAVE THREE FABULOUS GIRLS AND GRANDCHILDREN. AND THEN, BANG -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HAD A BACK ACHE. I WAS BICYCLING ACROSS SOUTH AMERICA, AND I WAS IN AFRICA DOING THINGS. AND I WAS FISHING IN MONTANA. I COULDN'T GET RID OF THIS BACK ACHE. AND THE ORTHOPEDIST SAID, "WELL, IT'S YOUR LIFESTYLE. YOU'RE GETTING OLDER." AND A VERY SMART DOCTOR FROM MY OLD CLINIC SAID, "I THINK I'M GONNA RUN SOME BLOOD TESTS." AND I WAS CALLED INTO AN OFFICE, AND A MAN LOOKED AT ALL THE NUMBERS AND HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID, "YOU HAVE A A MALIGNANCY. IT'S CALLED MULTIPLE MYELOMA. IT'S A CANCER. AND IT WAS A VERY TOUGH TIME. VERY TOUGH TIME. BUT I MADE IT.
Jimmy: HOW DOES THE FAMILY DEAL WITH IT?
THE FAMILY WAS FANTASTIC. AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK TO HELP OTHER FAMILIES, BECAUSE SOMEBODY IN YOUR FAMILY GETS CANCER, AND THEN EVERYBODY GETS CANCER. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL INVOLVED IN THE TREATMENT, MAKING SURE YOU'RE TAKING THE RIGHT PILLS. YOUR LIFE CHANGES PROFOUNDLY. AND YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP THE SENSE OF HUMOR GOING, AND YOU'VE GOTTA KEEP THE RELATIONSHIPS GOING. AND I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR A A STRONGER, BETTER, MORE INFORMED FAMILY. OUR ELDEST DAUGHTER IS A A DOCTOR. AND I TELL FAMILIES NOW, GET SOMEBODY YOU WHO'S A DOCTOR OR WHO HAS MEDICAL EXPERTISE, PUT THEM OFF TO THE SIDE, AND THEY BECOME YOUR INTERPRETER, YOUR OMBUDSMAN, THEY HELP YOU THROUGH ALL THAT. AND THAT WAS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. AND I -- AND I'M NOW IN REMISSION. I STILL HAVE SOME BONE DAMAGE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. YEAH, BECAUSE IT AFFECTS BONES AS WELL, AND I HAD SPINAL DAMAGE AND THEY HAD TO REPAIR THAT. AND THEY DIDN'T TELL ME UNTIL I CAME OUT OF IT. THEY SAID, "YOU WERE 5'11" GOING IN. YOU'RE NOW 5'9." I LOST 2 INCHES IN HEIGHT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE MUCH SHORTER. YEAH, YEAH. SIGNIFICANT. WELL, I GOT TO SAY -- YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE BOOK, BECAUSE THE STORIES YOU TELL IN HERE AND THE ADVICE YOU GIVE IS FANTASTIC ADVICE. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS A A HAPPY ENDING. WE'RE HAPPY YOU'RE HERE, BUDDY. THANK YOU FOR WRITING IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
