Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! AND WELCOME! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! VERY NICE, WELCOME. AH, OH, MY GOODNESS. WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. HOT CROWD. HOT CROWD, WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ARE YOU GUYS FEELING GOOD? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. WHILE SPEAKING AT AN AFRICAN LEADERSHIP SUMMIT YESTERDAY, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN ACCIDENTALLY REFERRED TO AFRICA AS A COUNTRY INSTEAD OF A A CONTINENT. [ LAUGHTER ] TO BE FAIR, MOST OF WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT AFRICA IS BASED ON "THE LION KING." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, NA! OBAMA PLAYS IT FOR HIM ON A A LONG CAR RIDES.
Steve: AW, THAT'S SWEET. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, HE'S ASLEEP, HONEY. HE'S ASLEEP. [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF PRESIDENT OBAMA, A A NEW POLL FOUND THAT HIS APPROVAL RATING HAS HIT A NEW LOW OF JUST 40%. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] OR AS OBAMA PUT IT, "60 UNDER PAR. THAT'S NOT BAD. IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THERE'S MORE TROUBLE FOR THE NSA, THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY. THAT'S RIGHT. THEY'RE SAYING NOW THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT A NEW LEAKER IS DISCLOSING GOVERNMENT SECRETS. YEAH. OR, AS EDWARD SNOWDEN PUT IT, DID SOMEBODY SAY "BUNK BEDS"? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IF HE'S A LEAKER, HE SHOULD BE ON THE BOTTOM BUNK.
Steve: YEAH, YEAH. THAT ALL DEPENDS. THAT DEPENDS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DID YOU SAY DEPENDS?
Steve: YEAH, DEPENDS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DID YOU SEE THIS? THERE'S A NEW SURVEY HAS RANKED NEWARK, NEW JERSEY AS THE UNFRIENDLIEST CITY IN THE U.S. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT DOESN'T REALLY SURPRISE ME THAT THE UNFRIENDLIEST CITY IS IN NEW JERSEY, BECAUSE LOOK AT THEIR STATE BIRD. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. I MEAN, THAT'S JUST --
Steve: THAT'S RUDE.
Jimmy: IT IS LOVELY IN THE FALL. BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR.
Steve: WHAT? THAT'S RUDE.
Jimmy: THEY HAVE OPTIONS. THEY COULD HAVE A DIFFERENT -- ANY OTHER BIRD THEY WANT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. NEWARK, NEW JERSEY HAS BEEN NAMED THE UNFRIENDLIEST CITY IN THE U.S., WHILE CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA HAS BEEN NAMED THE FRIENDLIEST. SO, TO TEST OUT THIS THEORY, WE SENT -- WE ASKED RESIDENTS OF BOTH PLACES THE SAME SERIES OF QUESTIONS, AND THEIR ANSWERS ARE PRETTY INTERESTING. TAKE A LOOK. FIRST QUESTION -- HELLO, HOW ARE YOU? CHARLESTON RESIDENTS SAID, "HEY, NEIGHBOR." NEWARK RESIDENTS SAID, "EFF OFF, CREEP." [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT, WE ASKED, CAN YOU POINT ME IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HARDWARE STORE? CHARLESTON RESIDENTS SAID, "SURE, IT'S THREE BLOCKS DOWN ON THE LEFT AND SAY HELLO TO THE OWNER, MR. SANDERSON, FOR ME." THE NEWARK RESIDENTS SAID, "I GOT YOUR HARDWARE RIGHT HERE, PAL." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN HE GRABS HIS -- HE GRABS HIS CROTCH.
Steve: HE GRABS HIS CROTCH.
Jimmy: YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
Steve: THAT'S RUDE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, WE ASKED, WHAT DO YOU WANT MOST OUT OF LIFE? CHARLESTON RESIDENTS SAID, "YOU'RE STARTING TO MAKE ME A A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE." [ LAUGHTER ] NEWARK RESIDENTS SAID, "WOW, NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED ME THAT BEFORE. I'M SORRY I WAS SO RUDE EARLIER. THE CITY CAN BE A SCARY PLACE, MAN. I BUILT UP A TOUGH EXTERIOR JUST TO SURVIVE. I GUESS SOMETIMES IT PUSHES PEOPLE AWAY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I GUESS THEY JUST NEED SOMEONE TO REACH OUT TO THEM. APPARENTLY.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: SOME BUSINESS NEWS HERE. DISNEY HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THE SUCCESS OF "FROZEN" HAS HELPED ITS PROFITS REACH AN ALL-TIME HIGH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY SAID THIS IS THE MOST WE'VE MADE OFF OF SOMETHING FROZEN SINCE WALT DISNEY.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT GREAT? [ AUDIENCE OOHS ]

Jimmy: GOOD PIECE OF TRIV. HEY, GET THIS. POLICE IN OHIO ARE LOOKING FOR TWO WOMEN WHO TRIED TO ROB A A BAKERY, BUT ENDED UP LEAVING WITH ONLY TWO GLAZED DONUTS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MONEY IN THE REGISTER. [ LAUGHTER ] THE COPS ARE OFFERING A SMALL REWARD FOR INFORMATION ON THE WOMEN AND A HUGE REWARD FOR INFO ON THOSE DONUTS. I MEAN, THEY REALLY -- IF THEY COULD GET THEIR HANDS ON THOSE GUYS. YUM, NOM, NOM, NOM, NOM, NOM. BING! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON OVER IN COLORADO. I LOVE COLORADO, BUT -- YEAH. COLORADO? YEAH, HE FORGOT HE'S FROM THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T TELL HIM WHERE HE IS.

THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A GOAT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM A A COUNTY FAIR. YEP, THEY SAY IT'S GOT A BEARD, IT'S WALKING AROUND ON ALL FOURS, AND WILL EAT ANYTHING. AND THE POLICE IN COLORADO WERE LIKE, "YOU GOTTA TO BE WAY MORE SPECIFIC." [ LAUGHTER ] "I MEAN, WE JUST LEGALIZED WEED NOT TOO LONG AGO. YOU JUST DESCRIBED HALF OF OUR POPULATION." IT'S LIKE, "WHAT'S UP, DUDE?"
Steve: "GOT ANY FUNYUNS?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, I SAW THAT LeBRON JAMES SUPPOSEDLY LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT SINCE HE ANNOUNCED HE WAS RETURNING TO CLEVELAND. WHEN ASKED HOW MUCH HE DROPPED, HE WAS LIKE, "HOW MUCH DO DWAYNE WADE AND CHRIS BOSH WEIGH?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT.

THIS IS SUCH A GREAT AUDIENCE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU FEEL IT, RIGHT?
BECAUSE THEY ACT LIKE THEY DIDN'T JUST SEE ME IN THE LAST SEGMENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EXACTLY, IT'S A LONG TIME --
YOU SCREAMED JUST AS LOUD, AND YOU -- [ CHEERS ] THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU FEEL THE ENERGY. FEED OFF IT. FEED OFF IT.
I FEEL IMPORTANT.
Jimmy: YOU LOOK GREAT. YOU LOOK SHARP, AS ALWAYS.
THANK YOU, MAN.
Jimmy: WHO MAKES THIS SUIT HERE?
THIS IS GUCCI.
Jimmy: OF COURSE IT'S GUCCI.
I'M FEELING GUCCI.
Jimmy: YEAH, FEELING A A LITTLE GUCCI TONIGHT. AND THOSE SHARP SHOES.
YES.
Jimmy: I MEAN, LITERALLY SHARP. THESE ARE ACTUALLY -- CAN YOU ZOOM? LOOK AT THOSE GUYS?
YOU WILL GET CUT WITH THESE SHOES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
LOUBOUTIN!
Jimmy: YOU ALWAYS WEAR SOMETHING GREAT IN HERE. YOU GOT THE FASHION -- DO YOU GET IT FROM YOU OR DO YOU GET IT FROM YOU WIFE?
I GET IT FROM MY MOMMA.
Jimmy: YEAH?
HONESTLY, I DO. AND IT'S AN INTERESTING STORY BECAUSE, GROWING UP, WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT. SO, A LOT OF TIMES, I WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THRIFT STORES OR SALVATION ARMY OR GOODWILL. AND I WOULD HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER REALLY INTERESTING OUTFITS. BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD ALL THE STUFF THAT WAS COOL AT THE TIME. I WOULD GO FIND AN OLD DOILY AND MAKE A HOT LITTLE HANDKERCHIEF OUT OF IT OR SOMETHING. AND THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I GOT MY STYLE.
Jimmy: THAT IS SUPER COOL.
YEAH. AND THEN, WHEN I DID FINALLY GET STUFF -- LIKE A PAIR OF JORDANS OR A A STARTER JACKET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- I KIND OF EMBRACED IT AND KIND OF TRIED TO DO MY OWN THING BECAUSE IT MEANT SO MUCH. SO IF YOU ONLY GOT ONE JACKET, YOU'RE GOT TO TRY TO WEAR IT LIKE 15 DIFFERENT WAYS.
Jimmy: EXACTLY, YEAH. EXACTLY.
SO I WOULD WEAR MY STARTER INSIDE OUT. YOU KNOW? CUT THE SLEEVES OFF.
Jimmy: KILT, WALKING AROUND WITH A KILT. A STARTER JACKET KILT. BUT IT'S GOOD THAT YOU APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE GOT. I LIKE THAT.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: HOW IS EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY? HOW ARE THE KIDS DOING?
LOVE, MAN. THREE YEARS OLD. IT'S, LIKE, THAT'S THE MOST AMAZING AGE EVER BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY KNOW MORE THAN YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY ACTUALLY DO. LIKE, MY SON AND DAUGHTER HAVE TAUGHT ME SO MANY THINGS. IT'S AMAZING TO SEE HOW THEY JUST -- EVERY DAY THEY WANT TO TEACH ME TO BE POLITE. THEY'RE LIKE, "NO, DADDY, THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO IT. YOU HAVE TO SAY PLEASE AND THANK YOU." I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T HAVE TO SAY PLEASE AND THANK YOU. THIS IS MY HOUSE!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M FEELING GUCCI TONIGHT. I DON'T NEED TO SAY PLEASE AND THANK YOU!
BUT, IT'S AMAZING. BECAUSE THEY SAY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LEARN FROM YOUR CHILDREN, AND THEY'RE THE TEACHERS. AND IT'S THE TRUTH.
Jimmy: AND DO THEY WATCH YOU ON "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT"?
NO.
Jimmy: OKAY.
THE ONLY REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN BED BY THAT TIME. WE REALLY DON'T LET THEM WATCH TELEVISION. THEY'RE MORE ABOUT MOVIES AND EVERYTHING. SO IT'S "FROZEN" 24/7 IN MY HOUSE.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU'RE, LIKE, LET IT GO, LITERALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN ♪
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT SONG. YEAH, MAN, I KNOW. IT MAKES ME CRY. THEY SHOULD SEE THEIR DAD ON "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT" BECAUSE YOU DO SO MANY FUN THINGS. I'VE GOT TO SAY, THE MIME BIT YOU DID WAS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST TRICKS.
OH, THANK YOU, MAN.
Jimmy: GO ON YOUTUBE AND TYPE IN "NICK CANNON LARRY THE MIME" AND JUST WATCH THIS BIT.
TRUST ME, IT'S CLEAN. NOTHING WEIRD WILL COME UP.
Jimmy: WELL, I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU HAD A DIFFERENT VOICE. YOU HAD THIS MIME MAKE-UP ON. YOU HAVE THIS LIKE SOUTHERN MAN'S VOICE.
WELL, THAT'S THE THING. BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE JUDGES ON "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT" CAN BE A A LITTLE MEAN AND A LITTLE HARSH WITH THEIR COMMENTS. HOWARD STERN, HOWIE MANDEL, HEIDI AND MEL B. HAVING THEM IN YOUR FACE -- I WAS, LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANTED TO GIVE THEM A TASTE OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE. SO I DRESSED UP IN A MIME. I WAS HORRIBLE AS HELL AS A A MIME.
Jimmy: YOU KEPT FALLING DOWN AND RE-PUTTING YOUR HAT ON.
YEAH, I WAS THE WORST MIME IN HISTORY.
Jimmy: THE CROWD WAS BOOING.
WHEN THEY GAVE ME THE FOUR Xs, I JUST LAID INTO THEM. I TOLD HOWARD STERN -- HOW CAN HE TELL -- HE RUNS HIS MOUTH ALL THE TIME. HOW HE CAN TELL ME WHAT TO DO. AND THEN, I TOLD HEIDI -- I SAID, "SUPER-MODELS AIN'T SUPPOSED TO TALK." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AS THIS IS COMING OUT -- HEIDI KLUM'S FACE IS, "WHO IS THIS GUY?"
I WAS TALKING LIKE THIS THE WHOLE TIME. THE AUDIENCE STARTED BOOING. I WAS LIKE "BOO YOURSELVES! BOO YOURSELVES!" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT. WHEN THE AUDIENCE IS BOOING. YOU'RE LIKE, "YOU SHOULD BOO YOURSELVES."
AND THEN I JUST JUMPED OFF THE STAGE AND RAN. AND HOWIE MANDEL -- LIKE I WAS GOING TO TAKE HIM OUT. THAT WAS THE MOST FRIGHTENED I'VE EVER SEEN A WHITE MAN IN MY LIFE.
Jimmy: YOU COULD TELL IT WASN'T ACTING BECAUSE HE DID THAT THING WHERE HE'S LIKE -- HE MOVED HIS HAND, LIKE, ALMOST SELF DEFENSE. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOUR BODY JUST DOES WHEN SOMETHING IS GOING TO ATTACK YOU.
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
Jimmy: HE WAS LIKE, HE WAS LIKE --
LIKE THIS IS GONNA DO SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NEXT THING YOU KNOW -- YEAH.
THAT'S HOW YOU KNEW BECAUSE HE HID BEHIND MEL B. LIKE SHE WAS GOING TO PROTECT HIM. LIKE YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT TOUGH WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO HIDE BEHIND A SPICE GIRL.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE GOT SAY, YOU'RE GREAT ON THE SHOW. WE LOVE HAVING YOU ON OUR SHOW ALL THE TIME. CONGRATS ON EVERYTHING, ALL YOUR SUCCESS. AND PLEASE COME BACK WHENEVER YOU WANT TO.
ANYTIME.
