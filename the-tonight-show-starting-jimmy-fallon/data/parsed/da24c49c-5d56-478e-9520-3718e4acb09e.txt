UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S NOT WHAT MOST PEOPLE MEANT WHEN THEY TYPED IN THE SEARCH FOR "GIANT BOOB." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT -- THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANTED. THEY WANTED SOMETHING ELSE. SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND DURING A SPEECH THIS WEEKEND, CARLY FIORINA SAID IF SHE GETS INVITED TO THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, SHE QUOTE, WILL NOT BE AFRAID TO THROW PUNCHES ALL NIGHT. WHICH EXPLAINS MARCO RUBIO'S NEW CAMPAIGN SLOWING "NOT THE FACE." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE MONEY MAKER THERE.
