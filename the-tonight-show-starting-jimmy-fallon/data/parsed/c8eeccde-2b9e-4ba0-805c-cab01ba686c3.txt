AND YOU DID ONE OF THE GREAT VERSIONS OF THAT SONG IN YOUR MOVIE.
Jimmy: I DID. IN "FEVER PITCH." I DID. THEY LOVE IT. THE BOSTON RED SOX LOVE THAT SONG. [ CHEERS ] WHAT'S THE CONNECTION THERE?
I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST STARTED. THEY STARTED PLAYING AT THE GAMES. PEOPLE KNEW IT, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PLAYING BOSTON, THE AREA FOR YEARS. AND IT WORKED ITS WAY UP, YOU KNOW. LIKE UP THE LADDER. AND THEN FINALLY, THEY PLAYED IT AND THE TEAM WON THE WORLD SERIES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT'S IT. [ CHEERS ]
Jimmy: THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. WHEN THAT HAPPENS, IT'S CEMENTED FOREVER. FOREVER IT WILL BE PLAYED.
AND I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT.
Jimmy: THEY GO NUTS. THEY GO NUTS WHEN THAT SONG COMES ON, IT'S FANTASTIC.
YES, IT IS.
Jimmy: AND THAT SONG -- THERE'S CONFLICTING STORIES. ONE IS THAT IT WAS ABOUT CAROLINE KENNEDY. AND THEN ONE WAS IT'S ABOUT -- IT'S NOT ABOUT, NO.
NO, NO. IT'S THE SAME NAME.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD.
AND I GUESS HER NAME RANG A A BELL. BUT I MEAN IT'S ACTUALLY THE STORY THAT I KIND OF MADE UP ABOUT MY WIFE AT THE TIME. BUT IT'S A GOOD STORY. AND -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: JUST STICK WITH THE THINGS. WE LIKE THE STORIES BETTER.
I LIKE IT. AND I NEEDED A NAME WITH THREE SYLLABLES. AND CAROLINE CAME TO MIND AND YES, I LIKED IT, I HADN'T HEARD IT, SANG GOOD, AND WE KEPT IT AND NOW IT'S OUT OF THE BAG AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. YEAH.
Jimmy: SPEAKING OF NAMES, NEIL DIAMOND. HOW DO YOU END UP WITH A GREAT NAME -- IT'S NOT A FAKE NAME. IT'S A REAL NAME. YOUR NAME IS NEIL DIAMOND. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, IT IS AND --
Jimmy: BUT, DID YOU EVER THINK OF CHANGING YOUR NAME?
YEAH, I TRIED. FOR THE FIRST RECORD I SAT DOWN AND WROTE UP A COUPLE OF NAMES WHICH I THOUGHT WERE ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.
Jimmy: DO YOU REMEMBER A A COUPLE?
I DO. THEY'RE STUCK IN MY MIND. ONE WAS -- AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS, JIMMY. NOAH KAMINSKY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT? NOAH KAMINSKY. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU CHANGE YOUR NAME FROM NOAH KAMINSKY TO NEIL DIAMOND. [ LAUGHTER ] NOAH KAMINSKY.
I DON'T KNOW, I LIKED IT, IT WAS BIBLICAL, IT HAD DEPTH, IT HAD CHARACTER. AND I TRIED TO USE IT. AND THE OTHER ONE, THE OTHER CHOICE I HAD WAS -- ICE CHERRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ICE CHERRY?
E-I-C-E. IT WAS SOMETHING FROM ELVIS OR SOMETHING? I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM.
Jimmy: EICE CHERRY.
YES.
Jimmy: I THINK THERE'S A A DRAG QUEEN DOWNTOWN NAMED EICE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU COULDN'T LEGALLY TAKE THAT NAME.
MY LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY TURNED AROUND. I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HERE.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE.
YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD ME HERE.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. CONGRATS ON THE NEW ALBUM HERE. THIS COMES OUT TUESDAY.
