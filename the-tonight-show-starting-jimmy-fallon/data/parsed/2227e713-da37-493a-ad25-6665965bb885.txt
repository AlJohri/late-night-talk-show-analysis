Jimmy: AH, HI! WELCOME, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I FEEL THE LOVE. I FEEL THE LOVE. I GIVE IT RIGHT BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT, BABY. THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE. YOU MADE IT. YOU GUYS, TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING. [ CHEERS ] YES! ♪♪ YEAH, IT'S THAT DAY WHEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LOOK AT THEIR BODIES IN THE MIRROR AND ASK, "CAN WE GET, LIKE, TWO MORE MONTHS OF WINTER? I MEAN, I PROMISE -- I PROMISE I'LL DO SIT-UPS. I PROMISE." I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S NICE WAKING UP TO THE BIRDS TWEETING INSTEAD OF THE PRESIDENT TWEETING. IT'S NICE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, SPRING TIME MEANS SPRING CLEANING, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE THROWING OUT THINGS THEY NO LONGER NEED, YOU KNOW, LIKE CLOTHING, OLD BOOKS AND MARCH MADNESS BRACKETS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, JUST GARBAGE. BASICALLY GARBAGE. DID YOU SEE THAT YESTERDAY WAS CRAZY? SOUTH CAROLINA PULLED OFF A A HUGE UPSET. [ CHEERS ] CLEARLY, YOU ARE UPSET. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CAROLINA, THEY BEAT DUKE TO MOVE ON TO THE SWEET 16. YEAH. [ CHEERS ] NOW, THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER RUSSIA HELPED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SO, I MEAN, THAT'S --

Jimmy: THIS IS KIND OF SCARY. A MAN CLAIMS THAT, THIS WEEKEND, HE SNUCK PASS SECRET SERVICE AT MAR-A-LAGO TO TAKE A A SELFIE IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PRIVATE STUDY. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] BUT TRUMP IS DENYING THIS, SAYING THERE'S NO WAY HE'D EVER HAVE A STUDY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS WEEKEND WAS ACTUALLY TRUMP'S FIFTH VISIT TO MAR-A-LAGO IN THE EIGHT WEEKS HE'S BEEN PRESIDENT, AND THIS IS WEIRD. EACH NIGHT AT DINNER, HE MAKES THE STAFF DRESS UP AS A CLOCK, A TEAPOT, AND CANDLESTICK, TO SING "BE OUR GUEST." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: MM-HMM.
Steve: WOW.

EVERY TIME TRUMP GOES TO FLORIDA, HE LEAVES A LITTLE NOTE ON THE DOOR TO THE OVAL OFFICE SAYING THAT HE'S GONE. YEAH. LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, ONE NOTE SAID, "BE BACK IN FIVE DAYS." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ANOTHER ONE SAID, "PLEASE WATER MY PLANTS AND TAKE PAUL RYAN FOR A WALK TWICE A DAY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: THIS ONE SAID, "I'M OUT OF THE OFFICE BUT WILL BE CHECKING TWITTER EVERY 20 TO 30 SECONDS WHILE I'M GONE." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELL, THIS IS GOING VIRAL HERE. TRUMP'S SON DON JR., IS BEING MOCKED ONLINE FOR AN ODD PHOTO SHOOT HE DID WITH THE "NEW YORK TIMES." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. IT'S HIM AND A TREE STUMP THERE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] VERY PENSIVE. MEANWHILE, HIS BROTHER ERIC WAS LIKE, "HEY WHEN CAN I GET OUT OF THIS STUMP COSTUME?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "HOLD ON. WE'RE NOT DONE YET. WE'RE NOT DONE YET. ERIC" -- A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MAKING FUN OF DON JR., BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS IT'S LED TO HIM, NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
ARE YOU TIRED OF BORING, OLD CHAIRS? DOES SITTING INSIDE HAVE YOU DOWN? DO YOU WISH THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY? THERE IS. INTERESTING, THE TRUMP STUMP. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SIT ON IT, LEAN ON IT, PLAY ON IT. IT'S THE NEW SENSATION SWEEPING THE NATION. DON JR. SAYS, "GET STUMPED!" BUY ONE IN STORES, OR JUST CUT DOWN A TREE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH, FANTASTIC. TRUMP STUMP. "YOU GOT TO GET A TRUMP STUMP."
Steve: "YOU GOT TO GET STUMPED!"
Jimmy: "BABY SAYS I GOT TO HAVE MY STUMP TRUMP." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I READ THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW ASKING CONTRACTORS TO SUBMIT DESIGNS FOR TRUMP'S BORDER WALL. TWO CONTRACTORS HAVE ALREADY STARTED SUBMITTING BIDS. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. THIS CONTRACTOR SAID, "IT'S A A MASSIVE THE JOB, BUT MY FIRM CAN DO IT." THIS CONTRACTOR SAID, "OUR COMPANY CAN GET IT DONE ON TIME AND UNDER BUDGET." THIS CONTRACTOR SAID, "WHAT IS A WALL?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] "IF NOT A METAPHOR FOR THE LONELINESS EVERY HUMAN MUST ENDURE. IT HEARKENS THE DIVIDE BETWEEN HUMANKIND, ITSELF, AND ITS SOUL. NAMASTE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS LOOK NATURAL? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STOLEN FOOTAGE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS LOOK NATURAL? DON'T I SMILE? NO? [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T SMILE? SERIOUS?
Steve: TRY AGAIN.
Jimmy: THIS IS PRETTY CRAZY HERE. DID YOU SEE THIS VIDEO OF THE GIGANTIC CHICKEN?
Steve: I CANNOT WAIT. I'VE HEARD ALL ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THIS VIDEO? OF THIS GIANT CHICKEN. ANYWAY, YOU GOT TO SEE THIS THING. IT'S A GIGANTIC CHICKEN THAT'S MAKING THE ROUNDS. IT SHOWS, WELL IT'S A THE GIANT CHICKEN, AND IT'S FREAKING PEOPLE OUT. THIS IS REAL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. WATCH THIS.
A CHICKEN IS TAKING SOCIAL MEDIA BY STORM. TWITTER USER -- CEO -- [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH!
Steve: WHAT!
"OH MY WORD," WITH THE QUESTION, "AM I THE ONLY ONE WONDERING WHY THIS CHICKEN IS SO BIG?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: KFC WAS LIKE, "WE'RE GOING TO NEED A BIGGER BUCKET. I MEAN THAT IS A BIG CHICKEN!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT CHICKEN ATE COLONEL SANDERS. ♪♪ OH. WHEN THAT BIRD FLIES SOUTH FOR THE WINTER IT BUYS TWO SEATS ON A DELTA FLIGHT. ♪♪ I MEAN, THAT CHICKEN IS BIG.
Audience: HOW BIG IS IT?
Jimmy: IT'S SO BIG, INSTEAD OF CROWING TO WAKE PEOPLE, IT JUST FLIPS THEIR MATTRESS OVER. "GET UP!" ♪♪ WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
