Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT PLAYING WITH THE ROOTS TODAY. YOU'RE NOT IN THE BAND TODAY.
JIMMY, JIMMY, THIS IS THE FIRST INTERVIEW NOT IN CHARACTER. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER TALKED TO YOU NOT IN CHARACTER.
Jimmy: NOT AS ZACK MORRIS.
NO. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO GO, JIMMY.
Jimmy: SO FAR, SO GREAT. I MEAN, YOU LOOK GREAT. DOESN'T HE LOOK AMAZING? IT'S MARK-PAUL GOSSELAAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE IN THE NBC FAMILY.
DOESN'T HE LOOK GREAT AS MARK-PAUL GOSSELAAR?
Jimmy: DOESN'T HE LOOK GREAT AS MARK-PAUL GOSSELAAR?
A COUPLE PEOPLE GROANED. THEY'RE LIKE, "WE WANTED THE BLOND HAIR. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS GUY."
Jimmy: NO, BUT WE OWE A LOT TO YOU. I'VE GOT TO SAY THANK YOU, BECAUSE WE DO OWE A LOT TO YOU. WHEN WE WERE FIRST DOING OUR SHOW, "LATE NIGHT", YOU WERE OUR FIRST VIRAL HIT. WE JUST ASKED IF YOU WOULD DO THIS THING. AND YOU GO -- YOU WERE SO NICE, YOU GO, "YEAH, TOTALLY, I'LL DO IT." WE'LL GET YOU A WIG AND WE'LL GET --
I FOUND THE CLOTHES. I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE ACID-WASHED JEANS IN MY WARDROBE, BUT WE FOUND ALL THESE CLOTHES AT A COSTUME PLACE.
Jimmy: THIS IS 2009.
LOOK HOW YOUNG WE LOOKED.
Jimmy: LOOK AT HOW --
LOOK AT HOW YOUNG.
Jimmy: BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE HAS TOLD YOU THIS, BUT YOU HAVEN'T AGED.
I DIDN'T AGE HERE, BECAUSE THIS WIG WAS ABOUT TWO SIZES TOO SMALL. IT PULLED MY FOREHEAD BACK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND IT GOT RID OF ALL MY WRINKLES. SO, IT WAS LIKE A GREAT WAY OF HAVING BOTOX WITHOUT THE BOTOX. A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY ON TWITTER WERE LIKE, "DUDE, YOU'VE GOT TO LAY OFF THE BOTOX. YOUR FACE LOOKS PLASTERED." I WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW, THAT WAS THE WIG."
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: SO WEARING THE WIG CAN ACTUALLY PULL YOUR FACE BACK AND MAKE YOU LOOK YOUNGER?
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: OH, I LIKE THIS.
LOOK, YEAH, SEE.
Jimmy: OH, IT ACTUALLY DOES WORK. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WIGS YOU CAN BUY ON AMAZON. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I HAVE TO SHOW A PICTURE OF YOUR DAUGHTER. DO YOU MIND IF I --
NO, NO, GO AHEAD. I THINK I PUT THIS -- YEAH, THIS WAS INSTAGRAM. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Jimmy: ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THAT'S THE CUTEST BABY. OH, MY GOSH.
THERE SHE IS.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS. OH, MY GOSH.
SO, WE HAVE FOUR KIDS. MY BROTHER -- I'M ONE OF FOUR. MY BROTHER HAS FOUR KIDS. THEY'RE ALL BOYS, MY BROTHER'S KIDS. SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA PROCREATE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND MY FAMILY IS FROM HOLLAND. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, BUT IN DUTCH, GOSSELAAR MEANS "[ BLEEP ] LIKE RABBIT."
Jimmy: NO, WAIT A SECOND. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SAY "RABBIT" ON THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU ALLOWED TO SAY THAT? NO, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED. NOT ALLOWED TO SAY "RABBIT" ON NBC.
SORRY, SORRY.
Jimmy: NO PROBLEM.
I'M SO USED TO THIS, BECAUSE I WAS ON CABLE LAST YEAR. NOW I'M ACTUALLY --
Jimmy: DIFFERENT STORY. YOU'RE ON NETWORK TELEVISION. YOU CANNOT SAY ANY TYPE OF RODENT ANIMAL AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
A RABBIT IS A RODENT, BY THE WAY.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T SAY THAT WORD ON OUR SHOW.
SORRY, SORRY.
Jimmy: WE'LL BLEEP YOU OUT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I DON'T WANT TO GET FINED, GUYS.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, NO, PLEASE. BUT THIS IS A -- WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN? [ LAUGHTER ] BY THE WAY, MARK-PAUL GOSSELAAR, I JUST SAID IT, ROLLS OFF THE TONGUE. I'M SO USED TO SAYING IT, IT'S LIKE THE COLOR BLUE FOR ME.
SURE.
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW MUCH I SAID YOUR NAME. YOU'RE ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THEN I WAS LOOK AT THE SPELLING OF YOUR NAME, THEN I GO, "IS IT GAUSE-A-LAAR?" LARR? LIKE GOS-A-LARR?
IN DUTCH, IT'S GOSSELAAR. HOW THAT ROLLS OF THE TONGUE. GOSSELAAR.
Jimmy: YEAH, NO PROBLEM. HERE, HAVE SOME WATER. MARK-PAUL GOSSELAAR.
GOSSELAAR.
Jimmy: SO YOU'RE SWEDISH?
NO, DUTCH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SORRY.
I THINK WE JUST HAD THIS CONVERSATION. I THINK WE JUST HAD --
Jimmy: I'M SORRY, I'VE GOT --
NO, NO, NO, NO. DID YOU KNOW THAT MY MOTHER, AND I'M SAYING THIS AS IF I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS, BUT MY MOTHER IS ASIAN. MY MOTHER IS FROM INDONESIA.
Jimmy: SHE'S FROM INDONESIA.
SHE'S FROM INDONESIA. MY MOTHER IS THIS TINY LITTLE INDONESIAN WOMAN.
Jimmy: YEAH?
YEAH. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT ZACK MORRIS IS HALF-ASIAN.
THAT'S WHY THE HAIR, THE BLOND HAIR WAS DYED FOR ALL THOSE YEARS. PEOPLE THINK, "OH, THAT WAS YOUR NATURAL HAIR COLOR." IT WAS NOT.
Jimmy: AH-HA. VERY INTERESTING.
COLOR BY CLAIROL. THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT A BOX YOU CAN CHECK AT THE DMV. THAT IS NOT NATURAL, GUYS.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD LOOK RIGHT THERE. COME ON. OH, MY GOSH.
YOU CAN SEE THE BROWN KIND OF GOING -- YOU KNOW, OUR SHOW, EVERY YEAR, WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE CANCELED. EVERY SINGLE SEASON OF "SAVED BY THE BELL" IT WAS CANCELED. AT THE END OF THE SEASON, WE LEFT, WE SAID GOODBYE TO EACH OTHER. THAT'S WHY EVERY SEASON MY HAIRSTYLE WAS SO RADICALLY DIFFERENT. 'CAUSE I WAS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. I HAD THE VANILLA ICE THING, BECAUSE VANILLA ICE WAS BIG IN 1990
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE.
SO I HAD THE SHAVED SIDES AND THE BIG BOUFFANT.
Jimmy: I DID WHATEVER YOU DID.
YEAH! [ LAUGHTER ]
I DID WHATEVER FERRIS BUELLER DID OR WHATEVER WAS COOL AROUND THAT ERA. THAT'S WHY -- REMEMBER WHEN ZACK MORRIS TALKED TO THE CAMERA? PEOPLE WERE LIKE, THAT WAS SUCH A NOVEL IDEA THAT YOU CAME UP WITH. I WAS LIKE, NO THAT WAS DONE BY FERRIS BUELLER. WE WERE JUST COPYING HIM.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH, THAT WAS LIKE THE MUSE FOR MY CHARACTER WAS FERRIS BUELLER. I WAS SUCH A FAN OF FERRIS BUELLER.
Jimmy: EVERY KID WAS.
AND THAT'S WHAT ZACK WAS.
Jimmy: WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT -- NOW YOU HAVE A NEW SHOW.
I DO.
Jimmy: AND TRUTH BE TOLD --
"TRUTH BE TOLD" IS THE NAME OF THE SHOW. OH --
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
I GET CONFUSED WHEN YOU SAY THAT. TRUTH BE TOLD, HE'S ON A SHOW.
HE'S ON A SHOW CALLED "TRUTH BE TOLD." CAN YOU SET UP THE SHOW AT ALL?
WELL, IT'S ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE, TWO COUPLES. A BLACK COUPLE -- I DON'T PLAY THAT PART.
Jimmy: YEAH, WELL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS?
I DO CHECK A BOX. I CHECK A BOX OF ANOTHER THING. MY WIFE ON THE SHOW IS PLAYED BY VANESSA LACHEY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO, IT'S A DIVERSE CAST AND DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW.
Jimmy: IT'S A COMEDY, SUPER FUN.
IT'S A COMEDY, IT'S A A MULTI-CAM. BUT I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAY IS THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN ALL FOUR OF US IS AMAZING. I KNOW ACTORS SAY THAT ALL THE TIME, BUT YOU'LL SEE, THE AUDIENCE WILL RECOGNIZE THE CHEMISTRY IS REAL BETWEEN US.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. "TRUTH BE TOLD." HERE'S MARK-PAUL GOSSELAAR.
SURE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WHAT ARE YOU REALLY TALKING ABOUT?
ACTUALLY WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT KIMBERLY.
THE BABYSITTER?
I FEEL LIKE SHE'S KIND OF --
DELICIOUS. TOTALLY. I TRUST YOU.
I TRUST ME, TOO. I TRUST ME NOT TO PUT MYSELF IN THESE SITUATIONS.
WERE YOU PLANNING ON SLEEPING WITH HER?
NO!
OF COURSE NOT!
SO, WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS YOU'RE MAKING A PROBLEM WHERE ONE DOESN'T EXIST.
OH, THAT'S HIS JAM.
MITCH, YOU'RE BEING CRAZY.
OH, WHAT'D HE DO? YELL AT ANOTHER COP FOR TEXTING AND DRIVING?
NO, WORSE. WE FOUND A GREAT BABYSITTER. KIMBERLY IS FANTASTIC. IN FACT, WE'RE ALREADY FACEBOOK FRIENDS. AND SHE FRIENDED ME, WHICH NEVER HAPPENS. I MEAN, NOT NEVER. YOU KNOW, I'M COOL. IN FACT --
STAY ON TOP OF IT.
BUT THIS ONE DOESN'T WANT US HIRING HER BECAUSE SHE'S HOT.
DON'T HIRE THAT GIRL.
THANK YOU.
