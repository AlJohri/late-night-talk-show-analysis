ISN'T THAT NICE? [ LAUGHTER ] "I'M NOT SAYING WHICH ONE. DONALD JR." AND SEVERAL SPEECHES AND INTERVIEWS, DONALD TRUMP HAS BROUGHT UP HIS BOOK, "THE ART OF THE DEAL," AND SAID THAT OBAMA WOULD HAVE NEGOTIATED A BETTER DEAL WITH IRAN IF HE HAD READ IT. IT GOT EVEN MORE AWKWARD FOR OBAMA WHEN IRAN WAS LIKE, "IT WORKED FOR US. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GUYS GOT SCREWED. THAT'S A FANTASTIC BOOK." [ APPLAUSE ] TRUMP KEEPS PLUGGING HIS 1987 BOOK "THE ART OF THE DEAL" OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL SAYING IT GOT HIM WHERE HE IS TODAY. YEAH. WE ACTUALLY GOT OUR HANDS ON A COPY.

Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT IT'S A REALLY LOVELY MOVIE. SO CHECK IT OUT.
Jimmy: I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO CHECK THAT OUT. ABSOLUTELY. HE'S JUST THE BEST, HE'S JUST A BLAST. HE'S ALWAYS DOWN TO TRY ANYTHING FUN. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A BUNCH OF THINGS. BUT ONE, I'VE GOT TO MENTION "STAR TREK."
YES.
Jimmy: THE THIRD ONE IS COMING -- NO, THIS IS THE 13th --
WE'RE MAKING THE 13th ONE PRESENTLY. YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND YOU'RE WRITING THE SCRIPT.
I'M CO WRITING IT, YEAH. WITH DOUG JUNG, MY AWESOME --
Jimmy: HOW FUN IS THAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I KNOW! IT'S SCARY. IT'S SCARY, AND IT'S KIND OF IRONIC, BECAUSE BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I HAD MY SITCOM IN THE UK WHICH IS CALLED "SPACED." WHICH SORT OF --
Jimmy: I LOVE "SPACED."
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT SORT OF CAME HERE ON DVD IN LIKE 2008. CATCH IT IF YOU CAN, IT'S A LOST TREASURE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT YOUR OWN --
I CAN, I SO CAN.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS THE ONE GAG --
THERE WAS A LINE IN IT WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT CERTAINTY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I SAY, "SURE AS EGGS -- NO, SURE AS EGGS IS EGGS, SURE AS DAY FULL AS NICE, SURE AS EVERY ODD NUMBERED STAR TREK MOVIE IS [ BLEEP ]." AND HERE I AM WRITING "STAR TREK 13." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IF NERD IRONY EXISTS, THIS IS IT.
IT'S RIGHT THERE.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND YOU PLAY SCOTTIE, OF COURSE. EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW THAT. NO SPOILERS, RIGHT?
NO. I MEAN, WE JUST STARTED SHOOTING, JUSTIN LYNN IS DIRECTING. JJ ABRAMS IS OBVIOUSLY OFF TO DO THE OTHER FAMOUS SPACE THING.
Jimmy: YEAH, I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: STAR SOMETHING OR OTHER. NOT "STAR TREK." "STAR SEARCH."
THAT'S IT, "STAR SEARCH." [ LAUGHTER ] HE -- JUSTIN DID THE "FAST AND THE FURIOUS" MOVIES. MADE THEM A GIANT, MASSIVE WONDERFUL THING.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S COMING IN AND DOING GREAT BUSINESS. SO, EXCITING STUFF.
Jimmy: DO YOU LIKE DOING ALL THIS ACTION STUFF?
IT'S ALL RIGHT, ISN'T IT? I MEAN, IT'S A JOB. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IS YOUR DAUGHTER IMPRESSED THAT DADDY IS IN A MOVIE WITH TOM CRUISE?
NO, NO. IT'S FUNNY. I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT WHEN I GO AWAY. BECAUSE I HAVE A 6-YEAR-OLD, AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN I GO AWAY, I WANT HER TO KNOW THAT IT'S BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO AWAY. IT'S NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO BE APART FROM HER. AND OCCASIONALLY I HAVE TO GO AWAY FOR A FEW WEEKS. SO I SAID, "LISTEN, DADDY IS GOING TO MOROCCO. I'M DOING A MOVIE WITH TOM CRUISE." AND SHE WENT, "WHO?" AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW TOM CRUISE? YOU REMEMBER LAST CHRISTMAS? WE HAD THAT LOVELY BLANKET, IT WAS LIKE A CASHMERE BLANKET THAT'S WHITE AND WE SOMETIMES PUT IT IN THE GARDEN FOR PICNICS AND WE CALL IT THE TOM CRUISE BLANKET." AND SHE SAID, "OH, YEAH, TOM CRUISE. THE BLANKET GUY." [ LAUGHTER ] SO I JUST THINK IT'S LOVELY THAT FOR HER, HE'S MOST FAMOUS FOR GIVING US A BLANKET.
Jimmy: HE'S A CHARMING -- HE'S A CHARMING MAN.
NOT ONE OF HIS FILMS.
Jimmy: NO.
JUST THE WOOLLY THING.
Jimmy: OH YEAH. THE BLANKET GUY, YEAH OF COURSE. YEAH. WELL, I MEAN THIS MOVIE IS ACTION-PACKED AND YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF ACTION SCENES IN THERE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, IT'S REALLY -- IT'S FRIGHTENING EVEN JUST TO WATCH.
THERE YOU GO.
Jimmy: I CAN IMAGINE BEING YOU. IN THAT ONE CAR CHASE YOU'RE SITTING NEXT TO TOM, AND HE'S FLIPPING THROUGH ALLEY WAYS. AND TOM WAS TELLING ME LAST NIGHT THAT HE REALLY DOES THESE EFFECTS.
ABSOLUTELY. I GOT IN THE CAR THE FIRST DAY AND SAID TO OUR STUNT COORDINATOR, WHO IS DOING THE DRIVING, AND WADE, THE GUY SAID TOM, I DON'T HAVE ANYONE BETTER THAN TOM SO IT'S GOING TO BE TOM. SO FOR FIVE DAYS ME AND TOM WERE IN THIS CAR IN CASABLANCA JUST BOMBING AROUND REALLY FAST, THROUGH LITTLE ALLEY WAYS, NEARLY HITTING MOROCCANS. IT WAS A REALLY REALLY -- [ LAUGHTER ] SERIOUSLY, IT'S VERY HARD TO LOCK DOWN THE STREETS IN CASABLANCA. SO OCCASIONALLY LIKE, YOU KNOW. SOME KID WOULD RUN ACROSS THE ROAD. GET BACK! GET BACK!
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
NO, IT WAS -- IT WAS LIKE BEING ON THE BEST ROLLER COASTER EVER, DRIVEN BY TOM CRUISE.
Jimmy: I MEAN HOW FUN IS THAT? AND HE DID THIS TRICK WHICH I DO TO MY WIFE SOMETIMES. WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING IN THE CAR.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHICH I JUST FIGURE -- I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT IT MAKES ME LAUGH.
YEAH.
Jimmy: HE TURNS YOUR SEAT HEATER ON.
YEAH, HILARIOUS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DO REALLY THINK IT'S FUNNY.
WE'RE IN MOROCCO IN LIKE VERY HOT WEATHER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I SAT THERE LIKE -- IT'S REALLY HOT IN THIS CAR. AND HE'S LIKE, "CAN YOU GET SIMON SOME WATER, I THINK HE'S GETTING DEHYDRATED." HE DID THIS FOR TWO DAYS. AND I REALIZED WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS ESSENTIALLY JUST KEEPING ME ALIVE SO HE COULD CONTINUE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT WAS LIKE -- YOU'VE SEEN "SEVEN?" IT'S LIKE WHEN HE'S KEEPING THAT GUY ALIVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S TORTURING YOU.
YEAH, HE'S TORTURING ME. AND ONE DAY I SORT OF TURNED AROUND AND I LOOKED AT HIM AND I SAW HIM DO IT. AND HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE, OOH! [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN IT BECAME THIS WAR BETWEEN US. LIKE WHO IS GOING TO -- BECAUSE HE'S SO -- HE'S ALWAYS ON IT. THE ONLY TIME I COULD DO IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF VERY COMPLEX MOVES THAT HE WAS DOING. SO HE WOULD PULL A 108-DEGREE E-BRAKE TURN AND WHILE HE WAS DOING THAT, WHILE THE SHOT WAS BEING DONE, I WOULD GO -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND PUT HIS SEAT WARMER ON.
THE END GAME WAS MARVELOUS. HE WENT TO THE BATHROOM AND I CALLED OVER ONE OF THE CAMERA GUYS AND SAID GET ME A REALLY SMALL SLIVER OF BLACK TAPE. AND I PUT THE TAPE OVER THE LIGHTS ON HIS SEAT SO HE COULDN'T SEE THAT IT WAS ON AND THEN I PUT IT ON FULL BLAST.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S GENIUS. SEE, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BRILLIANT.
AND HE CAME IN, SAT DOWN, COOKED, AND -- HE KEPT LOOKING AT THE LIGHT LIKE WHY IS IT SO HOT? [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN HE REALIZED HE GAVE ME THAT. HE GAVE ME THAT ONE.
Jimmy: IT WAS -- YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THE FILM, OBVIOUSLY. BUT WHEN YOU SEE -- I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DOES ALL HIS OWN STUNTS. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM. HE'S INSANE.
WHAT I THINK IS THERE'S SOMETHING VERY RIGHT WITH HIM, IN THAT HE CARES SO MUCH ABOUT THE AUDIENCE EXPERIENCE. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE HE'S OBSESSIVE ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE AN AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCE. AND THESE DAYS, CG IS AN AMAZING TOOL AND WE LOVE IT AND IT ENABLES US TO DO AMAZING THINGS. BUT WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING WHICH IS DIGITAL, THERE IS A SLIGHT SENSE OF DISCONNECT. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT REAL.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO IT'S AMAZING TO LOOK AT BUT IT'S NOT REAL. TOM TAPED HIMSELF TO THE SIDE OF A PLANE FOR REAL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HOW MUCH HE CARES ABOUT YOU!
Jimmy: I LOVE HIM, I LOVE HIM. I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. HE'S A MOVIE STAR. AND GOSH, YOU DO A GREAT JOB IN THIS FILM, AS WELL.
YOU WERE INCREDIBLE, BY THE WAY. YOUR LIP-SYNC BATTLE WAS INSANE.
Jimmy: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I WOULD MESS WITH THAT DUDE. OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO BRING IT. HE REHEARSED LIKE TWO DAYS.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T MESS AROUND
HE WENT ON TOUR WITH THE BAND HE WAS DOING THE SONG OF. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S JUST FANTASTIC. YOU'RE GREAT IN THE FILM.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND CONTINUED SUCCESS. I HAVE A CLIP HERE. HERE IS SIMON PEGG, TOM CRUISE AND THE TEAM IN "MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION" IN THEATERS AND IMAX ON FRIDAY. CHECK THIS OUT.
