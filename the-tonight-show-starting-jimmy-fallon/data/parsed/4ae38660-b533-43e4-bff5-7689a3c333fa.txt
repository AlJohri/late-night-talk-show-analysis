WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN TONIGHT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME TONIGHT. FIRST HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I SAW THAT YESTERDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA HOSTED THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT TOM BRADY COULDN'T MAKE IT DUE TO A FAMILY COMMITMENT. YEP. APPARENTLY THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY AT THE BRADY HOUSE.
HEY, YOU GUYS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: OH, MY GOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: EVERYTHING WAS FINE. TOM ENDED UP TAKING MARSHA TO THE PROM. GET THIS, PEOPLE ARE NOW CRITICIZING HILLARY CLINTON BY POINTING OUT THAT DURING HER LONG POLITICAL CAREER SHE'S SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED HER ACCENT MANY TIMES. WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT HILLARY STRONGLY DENIED IT SAYING, "THOSE PEOPLE OTTA KNOW ME BETTER. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M MICHAEL CAINE AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DESCRIBES HERSELF AS MICHAEL CAINE.
Steve: SHE DESCRIBED HERSELF AS THAT.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED HER ACCENT A LOT. PEOPLE ARE PRETTY MAD. JEB BUSH IS LIKE, "CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS, CHICA?" [ LAUGHTER ] SPEAKING OF HILLARY, SHE JUST FINISHED A CAMPAIGN ROAD TRIP THROUGH NEW HAMPSHIRE THIS WEEK MEETING WITH SEVERAL LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS AND SHE SEEMED TO REALLY ENJOY THE TRIP. SHE EVEN REVIEWED SOME OF THE LOCAL BUSINESSES ON YELP. TAKE A LOOK AT THESE. FIRST ONE IS FOR A BED AND BREAKFAST CALLED THE WAYFIELD INN. HILLARY WROTE, "I HAD A LOVELY STAY AND IT WAS GREAT CHATTING WITH THE OWNERS CHUCK AND DEBORAH, THEY ARE SOME OF THE NICEST VOTES -- I MEAN PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS NEXT REVIEW IS FOR STEVE'S COFFEE SHOP. HILLARY WROTE, "I THOUGHT THE BLACK COFFEE WAS OKAY BUT PERSONALLY I THINK AMERICA'S READY FOR A BOLD, CONFIDENT FEMALE COFFEE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] SEEM YOU AGREE. THEY SEEM TO AGREE ON THAT. FINALLY, THIS LAST REVIEW IS FOR ANN TAYLOR LOFT. HILLARY WROTE, "WHEN I WALKED IN SOMEBODY WHISPERED IT'S THE CHOSEN ONE. AND EVERYONE STARTED CHANTING MY NAME. ALL IN ALL PRETTY TYPICAL ANN TAYLOR LOFT EXPERIENCE." [ APPLAUSE ] SHE GETS THAT A LOT.
Steve: IT'S THE PANTS SUITS.
Jimmy: BIG NEWS OVERSEAS, THE ROYAL BABY IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE THIS WEEKEND. [ CHEERS ] I READ THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY CAMPING OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL IN HOPES OF SEEING IT. YEAH. SO IF YOU WANT TO BE THE FIRST TO FIND OUT WHAT THE ROYAL BABY LOOKS LIKE, JUST LOOK AT A A PHOTO OF ANY BABY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME. LISTEN TO THIS, TACO BELL ANNOUNCED THAT ON CINCO DE MAYO IT WILL INTRODUCE ITS HOTTEST SAUCE PACKET EVER CALLED DIABLO. AND IF YOU TRY TACO BELL'S HOTTEST SAUCE EVER ON CINCO DE MAYO JUST REMEMBER YOU'LL BE IN EL BANO UNTIL UNO DE JUNO. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] UNO DE JUNO?
Steve: UNO DE JUNO.
Jimmy: ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY FROM THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COUNCIL, AMERICANS ARE THE LEAST ACTIVE THEY'VE BEEN SINCE 2007. SOME SAY IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S MORE TECHNOLOGY WHILE OTHERS SAY IT'S BECAUSE WINTER NOW LASTS 11 MONTHS A YEAR. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHERE'S SPRING? WHAT HAPPENED TO SPRING? WE LOST SPRING COMPLETELY.
Steve: WINTER IS HERE.
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT, AMERICANS ARE NOW MORE INACTIVE THAN EVER. NETFLIX IS LIKE, "YOU'RE WELCOME. YOUR NEXT EPISODE STARTS IN 18 SECONDS, DON'T GET UP." UH -- DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? HISTORIANS RECENTLY TRANSLATED AN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN TEXT WHICH APPEARS TO BE A CURE FOR HANGOVERS. YEAH, I GUESS ANCIENT EGYPTIANS USED TO PARTY A LOT, WHICH YOU CAN SORT OF TELL BY SOME OF THE DRUNK HIEROGLYPHICS THEY SENT THE NIGHT BEFORE. I MEAN YOU UP? [ LAUGHTER ] EMBARRASSING. THIS ISN'T GOOD HERE. I READ THAT SOME PRISONERS IN SOUTH CAROLINA HAVE BEEN USING DRONES TO SNEAK IN BANNED ITEMS LIKE CELL PHONES, TOBACCO AND MARIJUANA. OFFICIALS ARE PRETTY MAD, BUT NOT NEARLY AS MAD AS THE GUY WHO'S HAD TO KEEP STUFFING DRONES UP HIS BUTT. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN'T WE GO BACK TO BALLOONS? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HEY, NOTHING WRONG -- WHOA. WHOA! WHO'S CONTROLLING THIS? STOP CONTROLLING IT! LET ME JUST WALK. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S A LOCAL STORY, I SAW THAT A WILD COYOTE WAS ACTUALLY SPOTTED RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. YEAH.

WELL, WE HAD IN SIXTH GRADE WE HAD AN AWESOME SCIENCE TEACHER. AND SHE HAD AN ENTIRE CLASS JUST INVENTING STUFF. IT WAS AN HOUR OF US JUST FOOLING AROUND BASICALLY AND YOU COULD DO ROLLER COASTERS OR GAMES. AND MY FRIEND CLAY AND I MADE THESE PLATFORM HEELS. THEY WEREN'T SHOES. THEY WOULD JUST BE SOMETHING YOU WOULD RUBBER BAND TO THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SHOES MADE OF WOOD. WE CALLED THEM THE SHAQUILLE HEEL BECAUSE SHAQ WAS REAL BIG BACK THEN.
Jimmy: HE STILL IS.
HE'S STILL VERY LARGE. WE SOLD IT TO A KID FOR 20 BUCKS.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. WHAT? YOU RIPPED SOME KID OFF?
AND THEN HE BROKE IT THE MOMENT HE PUT THEM ON. I DON'T REMEMBER FEELING BAD ABOUT IT. BUT I FEEL BAD SHARING IT.
Jimmy: I JUST WANTED ASK. SO SHAQUILLE HEELS WAS YOUR INVENTION.
