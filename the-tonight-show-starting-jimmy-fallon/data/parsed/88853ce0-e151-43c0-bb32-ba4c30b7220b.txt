Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. BOBBY CANNAVALE, WELCOME. GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUDDY.
THAT'S A GREAT SONG.
Jimmy: "VINYL," YEAH. DUDE THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. CONGRATS TO EVERYBODY ON THE SHOW AND EVERYBODY, BUT CONGRATS TO THE FAMILY -- YOU HAVE A LITTLE BABY.
YEAH, I'M PRETTY HAPPY ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: YEAH I KNOW, CONGRATULATIONS. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU WERE JUST SHOWING ME PICTURES PICTURES BACKSTAGE. THE CUTEST BABY.
THANK YOU. THANKS FOR ACTING LIKE YOU WERE INTERESTED IN THE PICTURES.
Jimmy: NO -- I WAS TALKING TO YOU BECAUSE I NEVER WANTED TO BE THAT GUY WHEN I HAD -- I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW PEOPLE PICTURES OF MY BABY. BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE.
THEY DON'T CARE.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T.
THEY DO NOT CARE. ONLY AFTER YOU'VE SHOWN THEM TEN PICTURES, THAT YOU REALIZE THEY DIDN'T CARE AFTER THE FIRST ONE.
Jimmy: BUT TO YOU A A MEMORABLE MOMENT. LOOK HOW CUTE. BUT I REALLY DO CARE. BECAUSE I'M IN THAT PHASE OF MY LIFE WHERE I DO CARE.
PRETTY BLISSFUL AT TIMES. IT'S NICE -- JUST MAKE YOU HAPPY, RIGHT?
Jimmy: THEY JUST MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY. WHAT'S HIS NAME?
ROCCO.
Jimmy: ROCCO, COME ON, THAT'S A COOL NAME.
HE'S SWEET. HE'S A REALLY GOOD BOY. HE SMELLS REALLY GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BABIES DO SMELL GOOD, RIGHT?
THEY SMELL SO GOOD. I HAVE A SON WHO IS GOING TO BE 21 NEXT MONTH. AND HE DID NOT SMELL GOOD.
Jimmy: NO. BIG CHANGE. BABIES ARE JUST --
HE SMELLS BAD.
Jimmy: NO, NO, HE DOES. HE'S A COOL KID.
HE'S CUTE, BUT HE DOESN'T SMELL GOOD. SO IT'S A WEIRD POSITION TO HAVE, GOOD SMELL, BAD SMELL.
Jimmy: YOU SHOULD STOP SMELLING YOUR SON WHEN HE'S 21. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S NOT EVEN THE WORST THING I DO. YOU KNOW, I NOW HAVE THIS LITTLE BABY WHO I JUST CAN'T STOP KISSING, YOU KNOW? AND THE 21-YEAR-OLD, HE WON'T KISS ME. AND HE SMELLS BAD. HE'S GOT TATTOOS. HE'S GOT HAIR EVERYWHERE. HE'S LITERALLY THE ONLY GUY ON THE PLANET THAT I'M DYING TO KISS ME.
Jimmy: THAT'S A REAL DAD.
I CAN'T GET HIM TO KISS ME.
Jimmy: HE WON'T DO IT. NO.
HE WON'T DO IT, YEAH.
Jimmy: I KISS MY DAD, STILL.
DO YOU?
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH, I KNOW. YOU WOULD THINK MAYBE HE'LL COME AROUND AND EVENTUALLY.
Jimmy: GIVE YOUR DAD A KISS, COME ON. GIVE HIM A KISS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH BUT WITHOUT HAVEN'T ASKED FOR IT, RIGHT?
Jimmy: NOW I THINK IT'S OUT THERE.
I REMEMBER I WOULD ASK HIM, I WOULD SAY TO HIM WHEN HE'S LITTLE. I WOULD JUST SAY TO HIM, PROMISE ME YOU'LL ALWAYS GIVE ME A KISS. AND HE WOULD SAY, I DO, DADDY, I DO. AND NOW -- [ AUDIENCE AWS ] THEY DON'T CARE.
Jimmy: BACK WHEN HE WAS 19 YOU SAID THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] HE STILL TALKS LIKE A BABY. TALKING TO A LITTLE KID. LET'S TALK ABOUT "VINYL."
YEAH.
Jimmy: BECAUSE THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. YOU GOT A CHANCE TO WORK WITH MARTIN SCORSESE AND MICK JAGGER.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: I KNOW YOU LOVE MUSIC.
I DO, I LOVE MUSIC. IT'S A GREAT SHOW MAN. I HAVE A GREAT TIME GOING IN THERE EVERY DAY.
Jimmy: JUST GOT PICKED UP FOR A SECOND SEASON ON HBO. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU WANT TO SAY WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT DO YOU PLAY IN THE SHOW?

Jimmy: DOESN'T HELP, DOESN'T HELP THE SITUATION.
