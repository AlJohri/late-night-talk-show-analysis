Jimmy: RIGHT BACK AT YOU, BABY! OH, MY GOODNESS. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, LOOKING GOOD. IT'S GOING TO BE FUN TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. THIS WEEKEND WAS THE CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL ACTION CONFERENCE, CPAC, WHICH FEATURED SEVERAL SPEAKERS INCLUDING SARAH PALIN AND ALSO PHIL ROBERTSON FROM "DUCK DYNASTY." [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS A GOOD WEEKEND FOR CONSERVATIVES. A GREAT WEEKEND FOR WILD ANIMALS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "THEY'RE ALL IN ONE PLACE. LET'S HAVE A PARTY! THEY'RE ALL IN ONE BUILDING! WHOO! IT'S SAFE. IT'S SAFE." DURING THE CONFERENCE, RAND PAUL TOLD THE CROWD THAT IT WAS TIME FOR A NEW PRESIDENT AND THAT PEOPLE NEED TO HELP MAKE THE CHANGE. OF COURSE MOST PEOPLE AGREE WITH HIM SINCE THAT'S HOW TERM LIMITS WORK. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY WERE LIKE, "YEAH IT IS. THE PRESIDENT CAN'T RUN AGAIN. WE KNOW THAT. LET'S FOCUS ON SOMETHING ELSE." AND RNC CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS --
Steve: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: REINCE PRIEBUS CRITICIZED JOE BIDEN SAYING THAT HE CAN'T CONTROL HIS MOUTH. [ LAUGHTER ] KIND OF LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO SAY THE NAME REINCE PRIEBUS. [ LAUGHTER ] REINCE PRIEBUS. SOUNDS LIKE A DRUNK PERSON SAYING "RENTED PRIUS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ SLURRING WORDS ] "REINCED A PRIEBUS. I REINCED A PRIEBUS. IT'S PRETTY GOOD. DRIVES PRETTY WELL." [ LAUGHTER ] REINCE PRIEBUS TOOK A SHOT AT BIDEN, SAID HE COULDN'T CONTROL HIS MOUTH. AND BIDEN WAS LIKE, "THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID." [ LAUGHTER ] "SORRY, I DID IT AGAIN. WHY DO I KEEP DOING THIS?" [ LAUGHTER ] WHY? HE CAN'T CONTROL IT. PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HEADING TO SOUTH CAROLINA THIS WEEK, WHICH MEANS THAT HE WILL HAVE VISITED 48 STATES AS PRESIDENT. LEAVING ONLY SOUTH DAKOTA AND UTAH REMAINING. ISN'T THAT COOL? AND NOW SOUTH DAKOTA AND UTAH ARE COMPETING TO SEE WHO CAN GET THE PRESIDENT TO VISIT THEIR STATE NEXT BY RELEASING A A SERIES OF TOURISM SLOGANS TARGETED JUST AT HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] TAKE A LOOK AT THESE. FIRST ONE SAYS, "SOUTH DAKOTA, COME BE OUR BLACK PERSON." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: THAT'S CUTE. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT COULD WORK. COULD WORK.
Steve: MIGHT WORK.
Jimmy: AND UTAH RELEASED THIS SLOGAN. "UTAH, VEGAS IS JUST A SIX HOURS DRIVE." THAT'S NOT THAT CLOSE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO. THEN SOUTH DAKOTA RELEASED THIS SLOGAN, "SOUTH DAKOTA, WE WILL CARVE YOUR FACE IN MT. RUSHMORE RIGHT NOW." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THAT LOOKS LIKE HIS HEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] UTAH COUNTERED WITH THIS ONE. "UTAH, RYAN GOSLING VISITED HERE ONCE. WAIT, SORRY THAT WAS MONTANA. DAMN." [ LAUGHTER ] STILL HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING GUY. AND EVERYBODY LIKES HIM, YEAH. AND FINALLY SOUTH DAKOTA RELEASED THIS SLOGAN. "SOUTH DAKOTA, THE TROPICAL DAKOTA." THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS CALLED THAT. YESTERDAY KANYE WEST REVEALED ON TWITTER THAT HIS UPCOMING ALBUM WILL BE NAMED "SO HELP ME GOD." [ LAUGHTER ] OR AS KANYE CALLS IT, "SELF-HELP." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

YOU KNOW, LIKE AIRPLANES, AND STUFF.
Jimmy: AIRPLANES, YEAH.

Jimmy: BIG SCANDAL.
OH, YES.
Jimmy: BIG SCANDAL.

I WAS HOPING YOU'D DO A A LITTLE SONG AND DANCE NUMBER, SOMETHING TO KEEP EVERYONE HAPPY ON THE PLANE, BUT NOPE.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T DO THAT, NO. YOU DIDN'T EITHER.
NO, I REALLY DIDN'T.
Jimmy: YEAH. NUMBER ONE, YOU'RE NOT A GOOD FLYER.

Jimmy: NINE WEEKS?
YEAH, NINE WEEKS NOW, YEAH. I DO EVERYTHING -- OUR BABY IN PARTICULAR IS, WE THINK, ALLERGIC TO SLEEP.
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE, NO.
NO, WE JOKE THAT -- WE THINK THAT SHE THINKS THAT SHE'S KEEPING US -- SHE'S PROTECTING US FROM THE SLEEP MONSTERS. LIKE, "OH, I'VE GOT TO KEEP THEM UP, OR THE SLEEP MONSTERS WILL GET THEM."
Jimmy: NO. BABIES DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.
NO, NO, NO.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T CARE. YOU GO, "NO, I'VE GOT TO WORK TOMORROW." THEY GO, "I DON'T CARE AT ALL. I'VE GOT TO WAKE YOU UP AT FOUR IN THE MORNING."
THE TRICK I TRY TO USE IS THAT BABY EINSTEIN STUFF.

Jimmy: OH, I LOVE IT. YEAH. WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO DO, I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, LITTLE BABY. BUT YOU CAME FROM A FAMILY OF BOYS.
I CAME FROM A FAMILY OF -- YEAH, BOYS. HOMICIDAL BOYS.
Jimmy: THIS IS -- THIS IS YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S YOU RIGHT THERE. LITTLE BABY RYAN REYNOLDS.
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, MY DAD USED TO CUT OUR HAIR WITH A A HAMMER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT? I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS.
IT'S REALLY DULL AND IT TAKES A LONG TIME.
Jimmy: IT DOES TAKE A LONG TIME, BUT UP AGAINST A GOOD, HEAVY ROCK OR SOMETHING, YOU CAN TAKE THE HAIR OFF.
TOTALLY.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S CUTE. THAT'S A LITTLE BOY HAIR CUT. THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE.
IT REALLY IS.
Jimmy: BUT DID YOU GUYS FIGHT AND DO ALL SORTS OF CRAZY BOY STUFF?
OH, NO, NO. NASTY STUFF. WE WERE TERRIBLE TO EACH OTHER. IT WAS LIKE AN EPISODE OF "COPS" EVERY WEEKEND. IT WAS AWFUL. WELL, MY DAD WAS A COP, BUT THE COPS WERE OVER AT OUR HOUSE NOT FOR SOCIAL VISITS. THEY'RE OVER THE HOUSE BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE BEING THROWN THROUGH DRYWALL AND COMING OUT OF -- THIS ONE SET A BUILDING ON FIRE NEAR OUR HOUSE.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
THIS ONE CUT A HOLE IN HIS VOLKSWAGEN BUG THINKING IT WOULD BE WATER-PROOF IF HE THREW SOME CANVAS TOPPING OVER THERE. RIGHT OFF. THIS ONE LOVED TO CRASH MOTORCYCLES.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO, YEAH. INTO THE HOUSE. BUT NOW YOU HAVE THE LITTLE GIRL, AND THAT'S --
IT'S THE BEST. I CAN'T WAIT. IT'S JUST GONNA BE TEA TIME EVERY DAY WITH HER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU THINK. YOU THINK, RIGHT? YOU HOPE THAT THEY'RE GOOD AT SOMETHING.
NO, SHE'S GONNA BE A A FOOTBALL PLAYER.
Jimmy: EXACTLY. EXACTLY. I'M JUST LOVING ALL THIS STUFF. AND NOW YOU'VE GOT ALL THOSE THINGS --
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU, MAN. TWO LITTLE GIRLS.
Jimmy: I GOT TWO LITTLE GIRLS. YEAH. I'M BUILDING A LITTLE ARMY.
YES.
Jimmy: YEAH, LITTLE GIRLS. BUT I'M STILL GETTING INTO IT, AND IT'S THE BEST THING. IT'S JUST -- YOU'RE GONNA FREAK OUT. YOU'RE GONNA BE THE BEST DAD.
WE COULD END WARS IF WE JUST CARPET BOMBED PLACES WITH BABY HEAD SMELL.
Jimmy: OH, I JUST WANT TO SMELL THE BABY. "OH, MY GOD. WHAT ARE WE DOING GUYS? COME ON, LET'S LAY DOWN OUR ARMS." [ LAUGHTER ] "LET'S SMELL SOME BABY HEADS."
"LET'S HIGH-FIVE EACH OTHER TO DEATH."
Jimmy: ISN'T IT AWESOME HOW YOU BRING HER IN AND PEOPLE GO, "OH, CAN I JUST SMELL YOUR BABY?"
YEAH, TOTALLY, RIGHT? AND IT'S A LITTLE CREEPY. WHEN IT'S MY UNCLE DALE, I'M LIKE, "NO. YOU CAN'T. GET BACK IN YOUR PANEL VAN AND DRIVE AWAY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: UNCLE DALE. I'M GLAD TO HEAR HE'S RELEASED. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOU AND -- GOSH, WE LOVE YOUR CO-STAR IN THIS MOVIE. HELEN MIRREN.
ISN'T SHE GREAT?
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. SHE'S ONE OF THE BEST GUESTS WE HAVE ON THE SHOW. SHE'S SO FUN AND SO -- SHE'S JUST SO LIKE GORGEOUS AND --
AND BRITISH.
Jimmy: AND COOL AND BRITISH AND PROPER. BUT YEAH, SHE'S THE MOST FUN.
AS KIND AS SHE IS TALENTED. AND THAT WOMAN IS IMMENSELY TALENTED.
Jimmy: YEAH. WE PLAYED BEER PONG, I THINK, ON THE SHOW.
YES. EXACTLY.
Jimmy: SHE'S THE BEST.
TALENTED WITH THAT KIND OF STUFF, TOO. AND A POTTY MOUTH.
Jimmy: DOES SHE REALLY?
YEAH. UNEXPECTED.
Jimmy: YEAH. SHE SNEAKS ONE IN THERE. NOT READY FOR THAT. THE MOST FUN HUMAN BEING IN THE WORLD.
I LOVE HER.
Jimmy: "WOMAN IN GOLD." CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT?
YEAH, THE MOVIE IS ABOUT -- IT'S A TRUE STORY. IN 1998, A WOMAN NAMED MARIA ALTMANN, WHO'S PLAYED BY HELEN MIRREN, DECIDED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO SUE THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE PAINTING -- THE GUSTAV KLIMT PAINTING "THE WOMAN IN GOLD," THE MOST VALUABLE PAINTING IN ALL OF AUSTRIA -- WAS HANGING ON THE WALLS OF THE BELVEDERE, AND THAT WAS STOLEN OFF OF THE WALL OF HER HOME BY THE NAZIS IN THE 30s. AND IT'S A TRUE STORY ABOUT -- SHE AND THIS YOUNG LAWYER, WHO I PLAY, WHO TOOK THIS FIGHT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SUPREME COURT AND BEYOND INTO AUSTRIA AND HAD FOUGHT TO GET THIS PAINTING BACK. AND THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PAINTING THAN JUST VALUE. IT WAS HER FAMILY -- LOST HER WHOLE FAMILY AND HER FRIENDS AND HER LIFE. YEAH, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY.
Jimmy: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S RYAN REYNOLDS IN "WOMAN IN GOLD." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S CONCERNS, MR. CHIEF JUSTICE. THE "CAN OF WORMS" ARGUMENT. BUT EACH COUNTRY IS DIFFERENT AND POSES DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. UNLIKE, SAY, CUBA, IN AUSTRIA'S CASE, THERE'S A TREATY. SO THERE'S NO DISPUTE AS TO WHAT TYPE OF LAW COULD APPLY. WE RECOMMEND OPENING THE CAN AND EXTRACTING JUST THE ONE LITTLE WORM WITH A PAIR OF TWEEZERS, AND THEN QUICKLY CLOSING IT SHUT AGAIN. THE DEFENDANTS IN THIS CASE HAVE CONTINUOUSLY TRIED TO FRUSTRATE OUR ATTEMPTS, RAISING EVERY POSSIBLE OBJECTION, THREATENING AN ARMAGEDDON IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, BUT LET'S PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE HERE. THIS IS A CASE OF ONE WOMAN WANTING BACK WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY HERS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: RYAN REYNOLDS. "WOMAN IN GOLD." APRIL 3. IT COMES OUT APRIL 3rd. I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY "RYAN REYNOLDS, WOMAN IN GOLD." BECAUSE THAT'S NOT -- [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT YOUR NICKNAME.
PUNCTUATION'S IMPORTANT IN THAT ONE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT YOUR NICKNAME AT ALL. YOU'RE NOT THE WOMAN IN GOLD.
NO. THANK YOU THOUGH.
Jimmy: BUT APRIL 3rd IS WHEN THE FILM COMES OUT. I ALWAYS LIKE TO PLAY SOME FUN GAMES AND STUFF LIKE THAT WHEN PEOPLE COME, AND HAVE A GOOD TIME. WE HAVE FUN, DON'T WE?
I ALWAYS LIKE TO LOSE WHEN I COME PLAY FUN GAMES.
Jimmy: APPARENTLY, YEAH.
I'M TWO FOR TWO. I LOST AT OLD MAN SHUFFLEBOARD AND WATER WAR. I DON'T FORGET.
Jimmy: WE DRESSED AS OLD MEN AND WE PLAYED SHUFFLEBOARD. THAT WAS A GOOD ONE, YEAH. AND WATER WAR. SORRY, THAT WAS BRUTAL.
THAT WAS BRUTAL, YEAH.
Jimmy: THE LADIES LOVED THAT ONE.
OH, YEAH THAT'S RIGHT.
