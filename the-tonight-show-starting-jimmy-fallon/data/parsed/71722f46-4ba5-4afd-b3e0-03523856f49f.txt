I'M ON THE INTERNET ALL THE TIME. I'M LOOKING AT FUNNY CLIPS. MY FAVORITE CLIPS ARE THE ONES WHERE PEOPLE BUST THEIR ASS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I LOVE THE ONES WHERE THEY FALL BUT THEN RECOVER AND THEN FALL AGAIN. THAT'S THE BEST. AND NOT GET HURT, OF COURSE. BUT I LOVE IT WHEN THEY LIKE, DO -- NO, I'M GOOD AND THEN THEY HIT -- AND OH, THE DOUBLE WHAMMY.

HOW IS IT GOING, EVERYBODY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. I TRAVEL ALL OF THE TIME FOR WORK. MY FAVORITE PLACE TO TRAVEL IS NEW ORLEANS. MOSTLY BECAUSE YOU CAN DRINK IN THE STREET. THAT'S A BIG DEAL. TO BE ABLE TO DRINK IN THE STREET. AND I LOVE GOING TO A BAR AND HEY, GIVE ME A JAMISON AND GINGER ALE TO GO. I DON'T LIKE THIS PLACE. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T LIKE THIS PLACE. I DON'T LIKE THE MUSIC YOU'RE PLAYING. I THINK THAT CHAIR IS WEIRD. GIVE ME A DRINK IN A PLASTIC CUP TO GO, AND I'M HITTING THE STREETS AND I'M GOING TO ANOTHER BAR WITH A DRINK IN MY HAND AND I'LL BE AHEAD OF THE GAME ALREADY. [ LAUGHTER ] I WENT TO A RESTAURANT IN NEW ORLEANS CALLED COOKS. WENT TO THE BATHROOM, HUGE RAT IN THE BATHROOM. AND THE RAT LOOKED AT ME LIKE WHAT YOU DOING HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] HIS VIBE, VERY NEGATIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY NEGATIVE VIBE. ALSO, I'M JUST ASSUMING THAT IT WAS A HE. I THINK RATS ARE DUDE'S. THAT'S A DUDE TRAIT BE A RAT. ALL RATS ARE DUDES. UNLESS IT'S GIVING BIRTH RIGHT THERE. OKAY, THAT MIGHT BE A LADY RAT. [ LAUGHTER ] OR IT COULD BE A DUDE RAT PLAYING AN ELABORATE TRICK ON US. YOU NEVER KNOW. RATS ARE RATS. SO ME AND THE RAT, WE HELD EYE CONTACT FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS. I BROKE EYE CONTACT FIRST. HE WAS DEFINITELY THE ALPHA IN THAT SITUATION. I WENT TO MY SEAT, THE SERVER GOES UP, HEY, YOU GUYS DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT? I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET ANYTHING. I JUST SAW A RAT IN THE BATHROOM. HE SAID, MAN, WE ARE RIGHT BY THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. THESE BUILDINGS ARE 200, 300 YEARS OLD THERE ARE RATS EVERYWHERE, EVEN IN THE FIVE-STAR RESTAURANTS HAVE RATS. SOMEHOW HE MADE ME FEEL LIKE THE WEIRDO. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR BRINGING UP RATS IN THE RESTAURANT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF JEDI MIND TRICK THIS WAS. HE CONFUSED THE HELL OUT OF ME, BECAUSE I STILL ENDED UP ORDERING FOOD THERE! [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS I HAVE -- MY BAD FOR BRINGING UP THE WHOLE RAT THING. THAT WAS REAL MEAN OF ME, IT WAS INCONSIDERATE. I'M SO DRUNK. MY BAD, MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS IS A GREAT CITY. GOOD MUSIC, GOOD FOOD, GOOD PARTYING. LAST YEAR WE THREW MY COUSIN'S BACHELOR PARTY THERE. I'M THE BEST MAN, I'M IN CHARGE OF THE PARTY. THAT'S A BIG RESPONSIBILITY. I WANTED TO BE UNIQUE. SOMEBODY SAID HANNIBAL, YOU SHOULD HIRE A SECOND LINE TO FOLLOW YOU THROUGH THE STREET. I SAID WHAT IS THAT. HE SAID A SECOND LINE IS A A BAND, MOSTLY BRASS INSTRUMENTS. YOU CAN HIRE THEM TO FOLLOW YOU THROUGH THE STREETS. SO BASICALLY IN NEW ORLEANS, FOR $300 YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN PARADE ON A DAY'S NOTICE. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS SOUNDS GREAT. HOW DO I DO THIS? YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO THE POLICE STATION. THEY HAVE A PARADES DEPARTMENT -- NEW ORLEANS POLICE HAS A A PARADES DEPARTMENT. THERE IS A HOMICIDE, NARCOTICS AND THERE'S PARADES. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THERE'S OTHER DEPARTMENTS TOO. BUT RULE OF THREES FOR COMEDY. SO I GO TO THE POLICE STATION -- [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, I WANT TO THROW A PARADE. ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR PARADE? FIVE OF US. ALL RIGHT, FIVE PEOPLE PARADE. DO YOU NEED HELP MAKING A A ROUTE? YEAH I NEED HELP MAKING A A ROUTE. THIS IS YOUR CITY. I'M NOT FROM HERE. SO THIS POLICEMAN IN FULL UNIFORM, STARTS HELPING ME MAKE A ROUTE FOR A FIVE- PERSON PARADE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE WAS REAL NICE ABOUT IT. OKAY, YOU DON'T WANT TO HIT BOURBON STREET TO FAST, YOU PROBABLY WANT START ON CANAL STREET AND MAKING YOUR WAY TOWARD BOURBON STREET AND THEN PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY JOIN YOUR PARADE BECAUSE STRANGERS JUST JOIN YOUR PARADE. THAT'S PART OF IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE STRANGERS JUST JOIN YOUR PARADE, THAT'S PART OF IT. SOMEONE WALKING BY THEMSELVES, THEY SEE YOU, OH THAT LOOKS LIKE A VERY ACCESSIBLE PARADE RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GONNA JUMP IN THAT -- WALK WITH THEM FOR A FEW BLOCKS. IT'S WAY BETTER THAN WALKING ALONE, I CAN WALK WITH A BAND BEHIND ME. THAT'S THE BEST iPOD ever. IT'S A NO-BRAINER. [ APPLAUSE ] SO NOW EVERYTHING IS SET. WE'VE GOT THE BAND, BUT WE'VE GOT A ROUTE. THE NEXT DAY AFTER DINNER, WE GO TO THAT CORNER, WAITING FOR US THERE IS THE BAND AND A A THREE-PIECE POLICE ESCORT, BECAUSE IN NEW ORLEANS, FOR $300, YOU CAN DESTROY TRAFFIC ON A DAY'S NOTICE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE STREETS ARE YOURS FOR A A VERY SMALL PRICE, WE JUST START WALKING AROUND. THAT'S ALL YOU DO, WALK AROUND. MAN BEHIND YOU, POLICE IN FRONT OF YOU, THE BEST WAY TO WALK AROUND. I KNOW THIS, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND SINCE 1 1983 AND THIS IS THE MOST FUN I'VE HAD DOING IT. IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE. [ APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, OF COURSE, WE'VE GOT TO GET DRINKS OR STOP AT A BAR. HEY! GIVE US FIVE JAMISON GINGER ALES, LET'S GO, THIS PLACE SUCKS, I'VE GOT A PARADE HAPPENING OUTSIDE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE NOT HANGING OUT IN HERE. DO YOU SEE THE ENERGY OUT THERE, SIR? THEN WHEN WE GET OUTSIDE WITH THE DRINKS, ONE OF THE COPS SAYS, WHY DID YOU GET DRINKS? YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT A A WHOLE BOTTLE OF LIQUOR BEFOREHAND. A POLICEMAN SAID THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A DIRECT QUOTE FROM A A UNIFORMED NEW ORLEANS POLICE OFFICER. I'M SO GLAD I DON'T LIVE THERE, BECAUSE IF I DID, ALL I WOULD DO IS DRINK, GAMBLE, AND THROW PARADES FOR MYSELF ALL OF THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT HIM AGAIN? 6:30 ON MONDAY, THAT'S HANNIBAL TIME THERE. I DON'T WHY HE DOES THAT ON MONDAY, THAT SEEMS LIKE A A WEEKEND THING TO DO. HEY THANKS A LOT, YO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS, MAN. HANNIBAL BURESS RIGHT THERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GO SEE HIM IN PERSON ON SATURDAY. AT THE WILBER THEATER IN BOSTON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ >
MY THANKS TO PAUL RUDD, SHAQUILLE O'NEAL, HANNIBAL BURESS, ONCE AGAIN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT, BUDDY.
THANK YOU, MAN. APPRECIATE IT.
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COME BACK, PLEASE. AND THE ROOTS RIGHT THERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WE LOVE THE ROOTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STAY TUNED FOR "LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MYERS." THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. I HOPE TO SEE YOU TOMORROW, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
