I USED TO LOVE THOSE TIMES ON THE SHOW WHEN WE WOULD GIVE SOMETHING AWAY. I LITERALLY COULD NOT SLEEP THE NIGHT WE GAVE AWAY THE CARS. I WAS UP ALL NIGHT, CAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING THOSE CARS.
Jimmy: IT WAS AMAZING.
IT REALLY WAS AMAZING.

NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT'S BEEN DONE. YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.
Jimmy: YOU DID THE CARS. YEAH, EXACTLY. I DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.
AND ALSO, I WAS SO PARTICULAR ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THE BOWS WERE NOT BIG ENOUGH. I KNEW WHERE ALL THE CARS WERE STOWED ON THE LOT. AND I WENT THROUGH AND I SAW THE BOWS, I SAID, "THOSE BOWS AREN'T BIG ENOUGH. THOSE BOWS NEED TO BE BIGGER!"
Jimmy: IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET A CAR, YOU NEED A GIANT BOW ON TOP OF THE CAR.
YOU REALLY DO. NOBODY WANTS A FREE CAR WITHOUT A BOW. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: YEAH, YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY TO BUY YOURSELF PRESENTS.
"YES, OPRAH I WOULD LIKE COMPENSATION FOR THE BAD PICTURE I DREW OF YOU." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T HANG UP A A PAINTING OF YOURSELF, REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW, IT'S VERY FLATTERING TO HAVE PEOPLE DO IT. IF YOU COME TO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE, AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE PAINTINGS OF YOURSELF.
Jimmy: I NEVER THROW THEM AWAY, OBVIOUSLY. I PUT THEM IN MY CLOSET.
YOU NEVER THROW THEM AWAY?
Jimmy: I WANTED TO, BUT I JUST FELT BAD. AND THEN IT JUST SIT IN THE GARBAGE CAN, THEY'RE PAINTINGS. I JUST PUT THEM IN THE CLOSET. THEN THEY WOULD JUST SPOOK ME TO JUST OPEN UP THE CLOSET. OH, THERE I AM!
AND KEEP BAD PAINTINGS OF YOURSELF.
Jimmy: LOOKING BACK AT MYSELF WITH A WEIRD FACE. I THINK I WAS GOING TO GIVE IT -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT, YOU KNOW. BUT MY PARENTS ARE LIKE, "WE'LL TAKE IT."
YOU JUST KEEP IT. THAT'S RIGHT, GIVE IT TO YOUR PARENTS.

SO MANY PEOPLE TOLD ME WHEN I SAID I WAS COMING ON HERE, EVERYBODY I SAID, "I'M GOING TO DO JIMMY FALLON." THEY SAY, "OH, HE'S SO NICE. YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE HIM." SO TYLER PERRY TOLD ME TO TELL YOU, "HEY." AUDRA McDONALD, SHE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU, "HEY."
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH. I LOVE ALL THESE PEOPLE.
EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, EVERYONE LOVES YOU, RIGHT BACK. THAT'S WHAT THE FUN OF IT IS. YOU HAVE THIS AUDIENCE, YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE, THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE IN THE BUILDING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
BUT THEY CAME TO SEE YOU.
Jimmy: DO YOU MISS THIS? DO YOU MISS THE LIVE? DO YOU MISS THE AUDIENCE? DO YOU MISS TALKING TO THE PEOPLE?
OH, THAT I DO MISS, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY. I DO MISS THE AUDIENCE AND I LOVED MY AUDIENCES THAT CAME FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY EVERY DAY. AND THEY WOULD COME WITH THEIR FRIENDS, AND THEIR MOTHERS, AND THEIR COUSINS. IT WAS LIKE A BIG DEAL TO COME TO THE "OPRAH" SHOW, TO COME TO CHICAGO.
Jimmy: AND THEN YOU WOULD EVEN HAVE THE AFTER SHOW AND JUST HANG OUT MORE WITH THE AUDIENCE.
AND WHAT I LOVED ABOUT IT IS, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I USED TO SHAKE EVERYBODY'S HANDS FOR 10 SOLID YEARS, I SHOOK EVERYBODY'S HAND IN THE AUDIENCE. AND THEN, ONE DAY I HAD TO GO TO THE GYNECOLOGIST, AND YOU CAN'T GET ANYBODY TO DO THAT FOR YOU. THAT'S THE ONE THING YOU CAN'T GET SOMEBODY TO DO. YOU JUST CANNOT ROLL --
Jimmy: TELL ME ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
SO I HAD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR, MYSELF, AND WHEN I CAME BACK, BECAUSE WE HAD TWO SHOWS A DAY, I REALIZED I HAD SO MUCH MORE ENERGY. AND SO THEN I STOPPED DOING THAT. SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS. WHICH NOBODY WANTS AN AUTOGRAPH ANYMORE. THEY ONLY WANT SELFIES.
Jimmy: SELFIES ARE THE NEW AUTOGRAPHS, YEAH.
THEY ARE THE NEW AUTOGRAPHS. SO WHAT I STARTED TO DO, WAS, WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO WAS TO SPEND TIME WITH THE AUDIENCE. SO EVERY DAY AFTER THE SHOW, I WOULD SIT WITH THE AUDIENCE AND TALK FOR LIKE HALF HOUR, 40 MINUTES.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S GREAT. I WOULD DO THAT, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD CARE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DON'T KNOW. PEOPLE JUST WANT A FREE SPEAKER AND GET OUT OF HERE. THAT'S ALL THEY WANT. JUST A FREE SPEAKER. YOUR SHOW BECAME SO GIANT BEFORE EVEN THE INTERNET WAS AROUND FOR TWITTER AND FACEBOOK. SO WE GET FEEDBACK ON OUR SHOW FROM TWITTER AND FACEBOOK LIKE THAT, TOO.
YEAH, NOW.
Jimmy: THINGS GO VIRAL.
INSTANT. BUT IN THE OLD DAYS, BACK IN THE DAY. LIKE BACK IN THE DAY, I WOULD KNOW WE DID A GOOD SHOW IF I WENT OUT IN THE STREET AND FOUR PEOPLE SAID, "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD SHOW."
Jimmy: A COUPLE OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT, YEAH.
BUT IT'S EVERYWHERE YOU GO. LIKE 20 PEOPLE STOP YOU. THEN YOU KNOW, "IT'S A GOOD SHOW."
Jimmy: WELL, MORE WITH OPRAH WINFREY WHEN WE COME BACK, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE ARE HANGING OUT WITH OPRAH WINFREY, RIGHT HERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE ARE TALKING -- "SELMA" IS THE FILM. YOU ARE PRODUCING THE FILM AS WELL.

Jimmy: DAVID OYELOWO.
DAVID OYELOWO.
Jimmy: DAVID OYELOWO.
GOT IT.
Jimmy: THE FASTER I SAY IT, IT'S EASIER TO SAY IT.
DAVID OYELOWO.
Jimmy: DAVID OYELOWO. YEAH, EXACTLY. I LOVE SEEING YOU ALSO ACTING, TOO, BECAUSE HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF JUST SCRAPPING EVERYTHING AND JUST ACTING FULL TIME?
WELL, ORIGINALLY, THE REASON WHY I TOOK OVER OWNERSHIP OF "THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW." YOU KNOW, I OWNED THAT SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
YEAH, THE REASON I TOOK OVER OWNERSHIP OF THE SHOW IS BECAUSE I FIRST WANTED TO BE IN "THE COLOR PURPLE." I HAD BOSSES WHO TOLD ME I ONLY HAD TWO WEEKS TO WORK ON "THE COLOR PURPLE." THIS IS A TRUE STORY. I ALWAYS TELL TRUE STORIES. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I HAD BOSSES WHO SAID, "YOU ONLY HAVE TWO WEEKS." AND I NEEDED TWO MONTHS. SO I GAVE UP ALL OF MY VACATION FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF MY CONTRACT IN ORDER TO DO THE MOVIE "THE COLOR PURPLE." AND THEN WHEN IT CAME TIME TO RENEGOTIATE, MY LAWYER AT THE TIME, JEFF JACOBS, SAID, "YOU NEVER WANT TO BE IN THAT POSITION AGAIN. YOU WANT TO OWN YOURSELF. YOU NEVER HAVE TO ASK YOUR BOSS AGAIN IF YOU CAN TAKE TIME OFF TO DO WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO. THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP OWNING THE SHOW.
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT WILD?
THAT IS WILD.
Jimmy: BUT ALSO, DID YOU GO CRAZY, TOO? BECAUSE --
BUT THEN I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO ACT. I OWNED IT, BUT THEN I HAD -- I OWNED THE SHOW, BUT I HAD TO WORK ALL THE TIME.
Jimmy: BUT NO VACATION AT ALL. I MEAN, SO MUCH WORK GOES INTO THESE SHOWS.
YES.
Jimmy: YOU MUST HAVE BEEN BURNT OUT.
WELL, THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, I WAS DOING TWO SHOWS A DAY. SO YOU DON'T DO TWO SHOWS, YOU DO ONE SHOW.
Jimmy: BARELY ONE A DAY, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] WE PIECE THIS TOGETHER OVER WEEKS.
THE REASON YOU GUYS ARE SO SUCCESSFUL IS BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS HAVING A GOOD TIME. EVEN THE AUDIENCE, I WAS LOOKING BACKSTAGE. THE AUDIENCE IS SO HAPPY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE SO HAPPY. YOU LOVE IT.
Jimmy: I'M HAPPY. I'M LUCKY.
YOU KNOW YOU ARE EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE, RIGHT? YOU'RE IN THAT VIBE.
Jimmy: I'M FEELING IT, YEAH. THIS IS ACTUALLY A FUN THING.
RIDE IT, RIDE IT, BABY.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, YEAH. WE WERE TALKING, WE HAD BARBARA WALTERS ON THE OTHER DAY, AND BARBARA WAS SAYING. SHE WAS TALKING TO YOU, AND YOU SAID LIKE A LOT OF THE STUFF YOU DIDN'T ENJOY IT AS MUCH BECAUSE IT JUST --
CAUSE YOU'RE JUST DOING IT, GOING FROM THE NEXT THING, THE NEXT THING, THE NEXT THING. SO THAT'S WHY I THINK, PARTICULARLY NOW, I TRY TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND TAKE THINGS IN. AND YOU SHOULD, TOO. BECAUSE AFTER A WHILE, EVERYTHING GETS TO BE LIKE, "OKAY, WHERE'S THE NEXT THING? WHAT'S THE NEXT THING?"
Jimmy: YOU GET ALL THESE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO YOU. AND YOU GO, "OH, THAT'S RIGHT. I FORGOT I DID THAT."
THAT'S RIGHT. IT FEELS LIKE A BLUR. YOU DON'T WANT THAT.
Jimmy: I KNOW.
YOU WANNA TAKE IT IN.
Jimmy: YES. THAT'S WHAT I'M TAKING IN RIGHT NOW. I'M TAKING IN THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW. LET'S TALK ABOUT "SELMA," A A FANTASTIC FILM. YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT. I THINK EVEN NOW, OF ALL TIMES, IT'S MORE POIGNANT THAN EVER TO WATCH THIS FILM. BECAUSE, FIRST PROTESTS AREN'T EASY TO DO.
NO.
Jimmy: A VERY ACTUAL LOT OF WORK GOES INTO A NON-VIOLENT PROTEST.
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU CAME AWAY FROM? JUST HOW STRATEGIC. FIRST OF ALL, HOW YOUNG THEY ALL WERE. THEY WERE SO YOUNG. AND HOW STRATEGIC AND DISCIPLINED AND RIGOROUS THEY WERE.
Jimmy: AND THEY ALL GET TOGETHER, YOU CAN'T JUST GO, "OH, LET'S JUST DO THIS RIGHT NOW." IT'S LIKE, NO, IT'S MONTHS OF PLANNING MAKING SURE IT'S DONE THE RIGHT WAY.
BUT DOES DAVID NOT STEP INTO THAT MARTIN LUTHER KING ROLE?
Jimmy: HE HIT THE HOME RUN.
HE HIT THE HOME RUN. OYELOWO.
Jimmy: YEAH, OYELOWO. DAVID OYELOWO.
YEAH, GOT IT.
Jimmy: I GOT THE NAME RIGHT. DAVID OYELOWO. JUST REMEMBER THAT NAME, BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT GUY. YOUR CHARACTER IS A REAL CHARACTER.
MY CHARACTER IS A REAL PERSON NAMED EMMY LEE COOPER. WHEN THEY FIRST ASKED ME, AVA DuVERNAY, OUR REMARKABLE DIRECTOR, SHE'S A GREAT DIRECTOR. ASKED ME TO DO THE ROLE. I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT. BECAUSE SHE ENDED UP HAVING TO SLAP THE SHERIFF. AND I THOUGHT, "WHAT AM I, THE SLAPPING ACTRESS? AM I THE SLAPPING ACTRESS?"
Jimmy: YOU SLAP PEOPLE IN EVERY MOVIE, YEAH.
I SLAP PEOPLE. IS THAT WHAT I DO? IN EVERY MOVIE? I'M THE SLAPPING ACTRESS. BUT SHE ACTUALLY DID --
Jimmy: TYPECAST.
TYPECAST AS A SLAPPING ACTRESS. WHICH WE WILL SEE. SHE, ACTUALLY, THAT DID HAPPEN TO HER. BECAUSE SHE WENT TO REGISTER TO VOTE FIVE TIMES AND EACH TIME SHE WAS TURNED AWAY. AND FINALLY, SHE HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE SHERIFF WHERE THE SHERIFF TRIED TO TAKE HER DOWN AND SHE HIT HIM. SHE HAD TO HIT HIM. THAT ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN.
Jimmy: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. YOU WATCH IT AND GO, "OH, THIS IS PROBABLY, THIS IS 200 YEARS AGO THAT THIS IS GOING ON?"
50 YEARS AGO.
Jimmy: ONLY 50 YEARS AGO. IF YOU WATCH THIS, YOU GO, "OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS GOING ON." AND IT'S FANTASTIC. AND YOU GO, "GOD BLESS THESE GUYS FOR PROTESTING.
I HAD ALL THESE GUYS AT MY HOUSE LAST WEEKEND. I BROUGHT ALL THOSE LEGENDS WHO WERE REALLY ON THE BRIDGE IN SELMA TO MY HOUSE LAST WEEKEND. AND WE HAD A SHOWING OF THE MOVIE, AND TO HONOR THEM. AND IT WAS REALLY TERRIFIC. MORE WITH OPRAH WINFREY. "SELMA" IS THE NAME OF THE MOVIE BY THE WAY, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT.

Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. "MIDNIGHT MEADOWS." IT WAS A SOAP OPERA. WE PLAYED HUSBAND AND WIFE. RODERICK AND VALENTINA KENSINGTON.
YES.
Jimmy: YOU DO REMEMBER THIS? IT WAS A GOOD SHOW. IT WAS A GREAT SHOW, I WOULD SAY. BUT THE DIRECTOR AT THE TIME, HE WAS A VERY INTERESTING GUY, I WOULD SAY. HE WAS EXPERIMENTING WITH AUDIO.
HE DID THAT THING WITH VOICES.
Jimmy: YEAH, HE WOULD CHANGE OUR VOICES DURING THE SCENES. I GUESS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE THINGS MORE DRAMATIC, BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT HELPED OR HURT THE SHOW.
IT DIDN'T WORK SOMETIMES.
Jimmy: WE HAVE A CLIP. LET'S LET THE AUDIENCE DECIDE.
WE DO?
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. CHECK THIS OUT.

Jimmy: SHORTER CLIP THAN I REMEMBER. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE DIRECTOR WAS THINKING THERE.
THE VOICES SEEMED A LITTLE DISTRACTING.
Jimmy: DISTRACTING. I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT. IF YOU REMEMBER RIGHT AFTER THAT, THE DIRECTOR STARTED TO THINK THAT OUR VOICES WERE TOO HIGH?
YEAH.
Jimmy: SO HE WANTED TO CHANGE IT WITH A DIFFERENT ATTACK.
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND GUESS WHAT?

Jimmy: I BROUGHT ANOTHER CLIP.
