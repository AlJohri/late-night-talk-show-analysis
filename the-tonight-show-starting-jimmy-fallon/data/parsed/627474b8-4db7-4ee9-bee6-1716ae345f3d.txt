Jimmy: A STAND-UP.
I DID STAND-UP.
Jimmy: REALLY? WHAT WAS YOUR ACT LIKE?
MY ACT WAS BASICALLY I WOULD DO IMPRESSIONS BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS LOVED DOING IMPRESSIONS. SO I WOULD PLACE FAMOUS PEOPLE IN ODD SITUATIONS. LIKE JIMMY STEWART IN THE LAUNDROMAT. [ IMPERSONTING JIMMY STEWART ] "WELL, WELL, I'M OUT OF QUARTERS." [ LAUGHTER ]

YEAH, I USED TO PUT JOHNNY CARSON IN LIKE, SELLING SHOES. ACTUALLY I DID SELL SHOES. I SOLD SHOES IN A GALLENKAMP SHOE STORE IN THE NORTHRIDGE MALL IN LOS ANGELES. AND SO I HATED THIS JOB SO MUCH THAT I USED TO PRETEND TO BE JOHNNY CARSON SELLING SHOES. [ LAUGHTER ]

I DID. BECAUSE WHEN I FIRST CAME TO NEW YORK, YOU KNOW. WHO HASN'T TRIED TO GET INTO CLUB AND YOU'RE LIKE, NOT ON THE LIST AND THEY WON'T LET IN AND YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH AND ALL THAT CRAP, RIGHT? SO I USED TO GO TO LIKE, STUDIO 54 AND PRETEND TO BE JOHNNY CARSON'S SON. [ LAUGHTER ] "MY NAME IS ON THE LIST, MY DAD PUT IT DOWN. IT'S KEVIN CARSON." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND THEY, HOW WOULD THEY --

Jimmy: OH, COME RIGHT IN, MR. CARSON.
"YOU DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE THAT, THAT'S FINE."
Jimmy: YEAH. AND YOU WOULD GET INTO CLUBS?
AND I WOULD GET INTO CLUBS. I ALSO USED TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO BROADWAY SHOWS BY GOING -- EARLY PREVIEWS OF A SHOW. THEY WANT THE THEATER TO BE FILLED.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I'D GO JUST AT ABOUT 7:29, JUST BEFORE THEY WERE GONNA START THE CURTAIN AND I'D SAY, "YES, I HAVE TWO TICKETS UNDER KEVIN CARSON. I'M JOHNNY CARSON'S KID. I WORK OVER AT NBC." AND THEY WOULD GO, "OH, OKAY." AND THEN THEY'D HAND ME TWO TICKETS AND I'D GO AND WATCH THE SHOW FOR FREE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S GENIUS. THAT IS AWESOME. HOW FUN IS THAT? [ APPLAUSE ] WHERE DID YOU LIVE WHEN YOU LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY?
I LIVED CLOSE TO HERE. MY FIRST APARTMENT IN NEW YORK WAS ON 51st AND 8th AVENUE ACROSS FROM THE THEATER.
Jimmy: HELL'S KITCHEN.
HELL'S KITCHEN.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. HOW WAS THAT APARTMENT?
IT WAS -- I HAVE THIS MEMORY OF, YOU KNOW, YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, YOU GO GET A A GLASS OF WATER, AND I WALK INTO MY KITCHEN AND THERE WOULD BE A THOUSAND COCKROACHES GOING --
Jimmy: WALKING AWAY. YEAH, YEAH. AND LOOK HOW FAR YOU'VE COME NOW.
WERE YOU IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD?
Jimmy: I DID. WHEN I STARTED "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" I WAS IN A STUDIO APARTMENT ON 50th AND 8th. AND MY DAD MADE ME STAY THERE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSE TO NBC IN CASE IT SNOWED OR SOMETHING. MY DAD DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE LATE FOR WORK.
I USED DO THIS OTHER THING WHERE -- [ LAUGHTER ]

THE SHERATON HOTEL WAS RIGHT NEARBY JUST ON THE --
Jimmy: THE SHERATON.
YEAH, IT'S ON 7th.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I USED TO -- WHEN I WAS AT JULLIARD I USED TO STEAL A TUXEDO FROM THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT. AND I USED TO GO OVER TO THESE CONVENTIONS THEY'D HAVE. YOU KNOW, A DENTAL CONVENTION. AND I'D WALK IN AND I'D PRETEND TO BE A DENTIST FROM OMAHA AND I'D GET FREE FOOD BECAUSE THEY HAD A BUFFET. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT IS GENIUS! [ APPLAUSE ]
I WAS STRUGGLING ACTOR.
Jimmy: IF YOU'RE A A STRUGGLING ACTOR, TAKE THIS LESSON. THAT'S THAT YOU DO. THAT'S AWESOME. AND NOW I GOTTA SAY I KNOW I'M LATE FOR THE PARTY BUT "HOUSE OF CARDS" IS SO GOOD. YOU ARE AMAZING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EVERYONE IS AMAZING.
YEAH IT'S GOOD.
Jimmy: EVERYONE THAT'S IN THIS WHOLE THING IS UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING.
IT HAS BEEN SUCH A PLEASURE TO DO THE SHOW. WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF WRITERS. BILL WILLIMAN, WHO'S OUR SHOW RUNNER, DAVID FINCHER WHO DIRECTED THE FIRST TWO EPISODES AND THE CAST IS INCREDIBLE. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, TO COME TO WORK EVERY DAY WITH ROBIN WRIGHT IS NOT A BAD WAY TO MAKE A LIVING.
Jimmy: NO, NOT AT ALL. SHE JUST HITS IT OUT OF THE PARK.
I AND THINK SOME PEOPLE THINK SHE'S SCARIER THAN ME.
Jimmy: YOU'RE PERFECT TOGETHER. YOU WORK SO WELL. DO YOU GO TO D.C. AND NOW PEOPLE GET SCARED OF YOU?
WELL, IT'S INTERESTING.
Jimmy: I WOULD.
FOR EXAMPLE, LAST YEAR I DID A BENEFIT FOR MY FOUNDATION IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND IT HAPPENED TO HAVE FALLEN ON THE NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN. RIGHT? AND EVERY ONE OF THE MOST MAJOR POLITICIANS SHOWED UP AT MY LITTLE BENEFIT BEFORE THEY WENT AND VOTED, AND OF COURSE THEY VOTED WRONG. BUT I THOUGHT, THAT'S NOT ME. THAT'S FRANCIS UNDERWOOD. THEY'RE ALL SCARED OF HIM. THAT'S WHY HEY SHOWED UP.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT YOU, OF COURSE.
NO, NOT AT ALL.
Jimmy: HAS THE PRESIDENT EVER TALKED TO YOU ABOUT IT?
WELL, I HEARD THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA LIKES THE SHOW. I THINK HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HE WISHED WASHINGTON WERE AS RUTHLESSLY PRAGMATIC AS IT IS THE IN THE SHOW. [ IMPERSONATING BILL CLINTON ] BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHO LOVES THAT SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] I LOVE THAT "HOUSE OF CARDS." [ LAUGHTER ] 99% OF WHAT THEY DO ON THAT SHOW IS REAL.

OR KEVIN SPACEY.COM.
Jimmy: THERE'S KEVINSPACEY.COM?
YEAH.
Jimmy: OH REALLY?
IT LEADS YOU TO THE SAME PLACE.
Jimmy: OH REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND IT'S A A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT --
WE DID THIS PRODUCTION OF "RICHARD III" THAT SAM MENDES, WHO PEOPLE MAY REMEMBER DIRECTING -- MADE A FILM CALLED "AMERICAN BEAUTY." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CHEAP APPLAUSE, THANK YOU. HE'S A GREAT STAGE DIRECTOR. AND WE DID THIS PRODUCTION THAT WAS HALF AMERICAN ACTRESS, HALF BRITISH ACTRESS DOING CLASSIC WORK. AND WE TOURED THE WORLD ACROSS THREE CONTINENTS, 12 CITIES, OVER TEN MONTHS. AND I DID OVER 200 PERFORMANCES AS RICHARD III.
Jimmy: OH MY GOD.
SO IT'S A WONDER THEY DIDN'T FIND MY BONES IN SOME PARKING LOT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE DECIDED THAT WE WANTED TO CAPTURE THIS EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT'S SO UNIQUE NOW FOR A COMPANY TO GO AROUND THE WORLD AND DO THEATER. AND IT WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. AND SO THIS FILM IS REALLY A A CHANCE FOR PEOPLE TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AN ACTOR IN A A COMPANY. AND IT'S ALSO A BIT OF A A TRAVELOGUE. AND IT WAS ALSO, FOR ME, A BIT OF A PRECURSOR TO PLAYING FRANK UNDERWOOD IN "HOUSE OF CARDS" BECAUSE MAYBE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT FRANCIS WAS ACTUALLY BASED ON RICHARD III, WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN.
Jimmy: I DID NOT KNOW THIS.
YEAH, THAT'S WHY I TALK DIRECTLY TO THE CAMERA IN THE SHOW BECAUSE I KNOW YOU MAY THINK FERRIS BUELLER INVENTED THAT --
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
BUT ACTUALLY SHAKESPEARE DID. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO IT WAS REALLY INCREDIBLE TO GO AROUND THE WORLD AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO LOOK IN THE AUDIENCE'S EYES. BECAUSE NOW IN "HOUSE OF CARDS," I'M JUST LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL OF A LENS. BUT THAT MEMORY OF SEEING HOW PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WERE DIGGING BEING THE CO-CONSPIRATORS. SO IT'S VERY INTERESTING NOW TO DO IT. AND PEOPLE STOP ME ON THE STREET ALL THE TIME AND SAY, "IT'S SO WEIRD WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO ME IN MY LIVING ROOM."
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S FUN.
I ALMOST SAID THE "F" WORD, BY THE WAY, JUST THEN. [ LAUGHTER ] I STOPPED MYSELF FROM DOING IT.
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'M VERY PROUD OF MYSELF, BECAUSE NORMALLY I WOULD DROP IT ALL THE -- TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU CAN'T -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] WHAT IS IT LIKE DOING SHAKESPEARE IN COUNTRIES THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ENGLISH?
WELL, WE HAVE SUBTITLES. SO USUALLY ABOVE US WOULD BE A A BIG SCREEN, SO WHETHER WE WERE IN BEIJING OR ISTANBUL -- ACTUALLY, WHEN WE WANT TO SPAIN, FOR SOME REASON, THE SUBTITLES WEREN'T ABOVE US. THEY WERE IN THE BOXES. YOU KNOW, WHERE PEOPLE NORMALLY SIT IN THE BOXES?
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT WE COULD SEE THEM AND IT WAS A GREAT LESSON FOR ME. NEVER LOOK AT THE SUBTITLES. BECAUSE ONE OF MY FELLOW ACTORS HAD A LINE WHERE HE SAID, "YES, MY LORD." AND I LOOKED OVER AND SAID, "SI, SENOR." AND I WENT, NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SI, SENOR. BUT I SAW IN THE DOCUMENTARY YOU HAVE THESE THINGS CALLED ANGEL CARDS.
ANGEL CARDS WE HAVE BEEN DOING AT THE OLD VIC, WHERE I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST DECADE. BEFORE EVERY PERFORMANCE WE PULL OUT ANGEL CARDS.
Jimmy: WHAT ARE THESE?
WELL, THEY'RE CARDS THAT HAVE A WORD WRITTEN ON THEM, AND WE HAND THEM OUT TO EACH ACTOR. EACH ACTOR HAS TO PICK A CARD THEN YOU HAVE TO -- WHATEVER WORD IS ON THAT CARD YOU HAVE TO INFUSE YOUR PERFORMANCE THAT NIGHT WITH THAT WORD. SO IT MIGHT BE SIMPLICITY. IT MIGHT BE TRUTH. WE ALSO WRITE OUR OWN CARDS. SO IT MIGHT BE VACUUM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN?
IT'S VERY HARD TO PLAY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. I GOT THAT CARD ONE NIGHT. IT WAS NOT A GOOD SHOW.
Jimmy: I SAW THAT SHOW.
IT KIND OF SUCKED THAT SHOW -- YEAH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU BEAT ME TO IT! YOU BEAT ME TO IT! I WAS RIGHT THERE! I WAS GOING TO SAY IT, I SWEAR! WE MADE OUR OWN ANGEL CARDS.
OH WE MADE ANGEL CARDS? OH FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: AND I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D TAKE ONE, AND WE'LL INFUSE THE NEXT COUPLE SENTENCES AS THIS EMOTION.
OKAY, I'VE GOT MY CARD.
Jimmy: OKAY.
OKAY.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, THESE ARE PEOPLE.
YEAH. THESE ARE PEOPLE, OH.
Jimmy: I GOT -- WAIT, DO I SAY WHO IT IS? OR JUST --
WELL, YOU CAN DO IT, AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO GUESS.
Jimmy: OKAY.
WHO YOU'RE INFUSING. SO YOU'RE GOING TO INFUSE THE INTERVIEW -- THAT THE IDEA?
Jimmy: YEAH.
OKAY, INFUSE THE INTERVIEW WITH WHOEVER YOU GOT ON YOUR CARD. [ AS ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER ]
Jimmy: HOW FAST CAN I DOWNLOAD YOUR MOVIE? [ LAUGHTER ] IF I GO TO KEVINSPACEY.COM! [ LAUGHTER ] OR TO NOWTHEFILM.COM! [ LAUGHTER ] [ AS AL PACINO ]

Jimmy: AL PACINO! [ APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A CLIP, I WANT TO SHOW YOU. IT'S KEVIN SPACEY IN "NOW IN THE WINGS ON THE WORLD STAGE." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IF YOU WERE BORN THAT WAY? IF YOU HAD HEARD EVERYONE CALL YOU EVERY NAME IN THE BOOK? IF YOU HAD IN YOUR BLOOD AMBITION AND LOYALTY? HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE YOU TO OVERCOME THOSE DISABILITIES THAT PEOPLE MADE FUN OF? HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE YOU TO TURN THOSE INTO STRENGTHS AND NOT WEAKNESSES? AND HE LOOKED AROUND THE CIRCLE AND HE WENT, "OKAY, HERE WE GO."
NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S ALSO TWO REASONS WHY WE CALL THE FILM "NOW," AS YOU JUST HEARD. THAT'S THE FIRST WORD OF THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PLAY, "RICHARD III." "NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT."
Jimmy: YEAH.
ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY, "NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCOUNT TENT." [ LAUGHTER ] AND -- THANK YOU. I'LL BE HERE ALL WEEK. THANK YOU. EVERY FRIDAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: EVERY FRIDAY. KEVIN SPACEY WEEK.
IT'S BECAUSE ALSO "NOW" IS WHAT THEATER IS. IT'S NOW. IT'S A MOMENT AND THEN IT'S GONE.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. YOU GUYS, "NOW IN THE WINGS ON A WORLD STAGE" IS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AT NOWTHEFILM.COM, AND IN THEATERS, AND AT KEVINSPACEY.COM.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YOU'RE THE BEST, BUDDY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH LEWIS BLACK. KEVIN SPACEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OUR NEXT IS GUEST IS A BEST-SELLING AUTHOR, A GRAMMY AWARD WINNER AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE STAND-UP COMEDIANS. HIS LATEST COMEDY SPECIAL, "OLD YELLER: LIVE AT THE BORGATA" -- [ LAUGHTER ] PREMIERED EARLIER TONIGHT ON THE FX CHANNEL AND IS AVAILABLE ONLINE AT FX-DOT -- I CAN HEAR HIM STEAMING MAD BACKSTAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] PLEASE WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW" FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME, LEWIS BLACK, EVERYONE. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NOBODY LIKES CONGRESS. NOBODY! I MEAN IT'S NOT WELL -- WELL 13% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LIKE CONGRESS. BUT THE REST OF US -- DON'T LIKE CONGRESS. AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF JUST HOW MUCH WE DON'T LIKE CONGRESS, THERE'S A POLLING GROUP THAT PUT CONGRESS UP AGAINST THINGS THAT NORMALLY WE DON'T LIKE. LIKE LICE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOBODY LIKES LICE. EXCEPT WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO CONGRESS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE LOVE LICE. FRANCE. NOBODY REALLY LIKES FRANCE. BUT WHEN WE COMPARE FRANCE TO CONGRESS, WE LOVE FRANCE. COLONOSCOPIES. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. COMPARED TO CONGRESS, WE LOVE COLONOSCOPIES. NOW, SPEAKING OF COLONOSCOPIES, I -- I THOUGHT I'D JUST TAKE SOME TIME THIS EVENING FOR A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. NOW, I REALIZE THAT ALL OF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A A COLONOSCOPY AT SOME POINT. AND ALL OF YOU ON SOME LEVEL OR ANOTHER ARE GOING TO TRY TO GET OUT OF IT. BUT DON'T. AS SOON AS THEY TELL YOU, YOU GET THERE. YOU GOT NO CHOICE. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF, OKAY? I THINK THE FACT THAT WE FEAR IT IS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SHOWN SO MANY VIDEOS OF THE PROCEDURE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I THINK THAT MANY AMERICANS FEEL THEY ARE GOING TO BE STRAPPED DOWN AND THEIR EYES ARE GOING TO BE HELD OPEN -- LIKE ON "CLOCKWORK ORANGE" -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO WATCH IT. NO! THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE IS THE BEST PART. IT'S THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT'S A A BITCH. BUT I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH IT. [ LAUGHTER ] FIRST YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THE PHARMACY, YOU'RE GOING TO GET A A GALLON OF A LIQUID THAT APPARENTLY WAS LEFTOVER AFTER WE MADE THE A-BOMB. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DRINK ALL OF IT. BUT BEFORE YOU DO, YOU GET INTO THAT BATHROOM -- AND YOU PREPARE IT AS IF THIS IS GOING TO BE IS SIEGE OF STALINGRAD. [ LAUGHTER ] BRING IN EVERY, EVERY DISTRACTION YOU POSSIBLY HAVE. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR iPAD, A A MUSIC SOURCE, A COMPUTER. IF YOU HAVE GOT A TELEVISION YOU CAN PUT UP OVER YOUR BATHTUB, GET IT IN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] MAGAZINES! IF YOU HAVEN'T READ "ULYSSES," YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FINISH IT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN THERE SO LONG, YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO WONDER, "WHY AREN'T WE AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE BY NOW?" THERE IS AN UPSIDE. A LOT OF STUFF WILL COME OUT OF YOU YOU FORGOT ABOUT. MY NAMING BRACELET. A WATCH MY GRANDFATHER GAVE ME AT 14. A STRING OF WHITE PEARLS. AND I DON'T REMEMBER HER NAME BUT I BET IT WAS A GREAT NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND JUST BEFORE, JUST BEFORE YOU PASS OUT, YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF ON THE COLD TILES WITH YOUR ARMS OUTSTRETCHED. "GOD!" YOU'LL CRY. "GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?" YOU'LL AWAKEN THE NEXT MORNING, GET TO THE DOCTOR. THERE YOU WILL MEET THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST. OR AS I LIKE TO CALL THEM, "ANGELS." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY'LL PUT -- HE'LL PUT A NEEDLE IN YOUR ARM. AND YOU'LL COUNT "FIVE FOUR THREE" -- AND YOU WILL BE ASLEEP. A LOT OF YOU THINK YOU SLEEP WELL. YOU DON'T SLEEP LIKE THIS! [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE BEST SLEEP EVER! I LIKE TO CALL IT "SLEEP HEAVEN." IT'S WHERE SLEEP GOES WHEN IT DIES. [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW! IT'S THE BEST SLEEP EVER. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE WHEN THE DOCTOR WOKE ME, AND SAID "WOULD YOU LIKE TO SLEEP SOME MORE", I SAID, "I'D LIKE TO SLEEP FOREVER." [ LAUGHTER ] I WENT BACK TO SLEEP. I WOKE UP. AND -- I HAVE TO SAY -- WHEN I WOKE UP I'VE NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE. I SKIPPED OUT OF THE OFFICE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] DO I LOOK LIKE A SKIPPER? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND I WAVED AT THE DOCTOR. AND SAID "I'M NOT GOING TO EAT TODAY AND I'M GOING TO BE BACK TOMORROW AND WE'LL DO IT AGAIN BECAUSE I HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE." THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: DO I LOOK LIKE A A SKIPPER? LEWIS BLACK RIGHT THERE. OH MY GOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. MORE WITH LEWIS BLACK. COME ON BACK EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

Jimmy: I REMEMBER YOU WERE SO NICE TO ME. AND THIS IS -- OBVIOUSLY, YOU CHANGED MY WHOLE CAREER OF COMEDY BECAUE I LOOKED UP TO YOU. I KNEW YOU. BUT I WAS OPENING UP FOR YOU, AND YOU WERE REALLY NICE TALKING TO ME AND MY DAD BEFORE THE SHOW. MY DAD USED TO DRIVE ME BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE. AND YOU WERE TALKING TO ME. YOU WERE GOING, "OH, YOU DO THIS CLUB AND YOU WILL BE GREAT. AND IT WILL BE SO FUN." AND ALL RIGHT I GO, "I'M GONNA GO BRING YOU UP." AND YOU'RE LIKE, "COOL MAN. GOOD KID. GOOD LUCK." I GO ON STAGE AND GO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HERE'S -- BLAH, BLAH, BLAH -- LEWIS BLACK. YOU GET ON STAGE AND YOU GO -- [ MUMBLING ] AND I GO, "WHO IS THIS PERSON?" [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS JUST TALKING TO A A DIFFERENT MAN FOR HALF AN HOUR.
YEAH, I GOT TO KEEP HIM HIDDEN. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M TELLING YOU, YOU DON'T BRING HIM OUT -- WHEN YOU ARE ONLINE IN AN AIRPORT AND THEY SCREW UP YOUR FLIGHT, YOU DON'T BRING HIM OUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE WOULD JUST KILL PEOPLE.
NO, IT'S NOT GOOD.
Jimmy: IT WAS THE GREATEST THING I EVER SAW. AND I GO, "OH THAT'S A A COMEDIAN. HE'S DOING AN ACT." IT CHANGED MY WHOLE VIEW ON COMEDY AND I LOVE THAT.
THAT'S GREAT. GET ME 10%. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT WAS SO GREAT. MY DAD SAYS HELLO.
DON'T GIVE MY ME LOVE.
