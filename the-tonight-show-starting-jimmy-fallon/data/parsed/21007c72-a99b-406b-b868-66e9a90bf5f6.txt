Questlove: 298!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HOT CROWD RIGHT THERE, THAT'S WHAT WE WANT! FRIDAY NIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. OH MY GOODNESS. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE, YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME TONIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME AGAIN. HERE IS WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. IT SEEMS LIKE -- IT'S JUST EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THE WHOLE WEEK. IT'S JUST THIS WEEK, HE'S BEEN ALL OVER THE NEWS, BUT HE'S STILL STRUGGLING TO BE SEEN AS A LEGITIMATE CANDIDATE BY REPUBLICANS. IN FACT, NOW TRUMP IS THREATENING TO START CAMPAIGNING AS A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOESN'T BECOME MORE SUPPORTIVE. OF COURSE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS SAY YOU NEED TO "GIVE RESPECT" TO "GET RESPECT", TO WHICH TRUMP SAYS, "WHATEVER, LOSERS." A LITTLE HARSH. DID YOU SEE THIS? WHEN TRUMP WAS ASKED WHY HE GAVE OUT LINDSEY GRAHAM'S PERSONAL PHONE NUMBER THIS WEEK. HE SAID, AND THIS IS REAL, HE SAID HE DID IT FOR FUN AND EVERYBODY HAD A GOOD TIME. [ APPLAUSE ] YEAH, "GOOD TIMES", SAID THE TEENAGER WHO SPENT ALL DAY TODAY TRYING TO SHOW LINDSEY GRAHAM HOW TO TRANSFER HIS CONTACTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HAD A GREAT TIME. HAD A GREAT TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT TIME. THAT'S RIGHT, TRUMP SAID HE GAVE OUT GRAHAM'S PHONE NUMBER FOR FUN, IN FACT, TRUMP RELEASED A WHOLE LIST OF OTHER THINGS HE DOES FOR FUN. AND IT SEEMS LIKE HE JUST -- HE JUST LIKES BEING ANNOYING. TAKE A LOOK AT THESE. FIRST UP THERE'S -- MICROWAVING CLAM CHOWDER IN THE OFFICE BREAK ROOM. AND THAT'S NOT FUN. THEN IT GOES AROUND THE OFFICE, IT'S JUST -- NEXT UP WE HAVE, WAITS UNTIL HIS WIFE FALLS AND THEN WHISPERS, "HEY MELANIA, WHATCHA THINKIN' ABOUT?" THAT'S NOT FUN, I JUST GOT TO SLEEP. I JUST FEEL ASLEEP, WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME THAT QUESTION?
Steve: WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? THAT'S RUDE.
Jimmy: THERE ARE LISTS OF THINGS THAT HE DOES FOR FUN.
Steve: FOR FUN?
Jimmy: YEAH, LIKE HERE'S ONE THING HE DOES, HE TOUCHES ALL THE PIECES OF A PIZZA AND THEN SAYS, "THESE ARE MINE NOW."
Steve: THAT'S AWFUL!
Jimmy: AND FINALLY THERE'S -- HE'S SAYS, "THAT'S GOOD COFFEE." AFTER EVERY SIP OF COFFEE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S GOOD COFFEE.
Steve: IS THAT TWO HANDS?
Jimmy: HE HOLDS IT WITH TWO HANDS.
Steve: OH, THAT'S AWFUL!
Jimmy: IT'S EVEN WORSE, YEAH.
Steve: YEAH, YEAH. [ SIPPING ]
Steve: GOOD COFFEE.
Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD COFFEE. TRUMP'S GOT EVERYBODY ALL WORKED UP. IN FACT, ONE GOP CONGRESSMAN NAMED CARLOS CURBELO ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THAT DONALD TRUMP MAY BE A "PHANTOM CANDIDATE" THAT IS IMPLANTED BY THE DEMOCRATS'. THE DNC STRONGLY DENIED THIS WHILE HILLARY SAID, "CRAP, THEY FIGURED IT OUT." TAKE OFF THE WIG, BILL. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE FIRED." SPEAKING OF HILLARY, A NEW POLL ALSO SHOWS THAT A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN COLORADO THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY. ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH COMING FROM THE MOST PARANOID STATE IN AMERICA. HILLARY CLINTON, WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT SHE IS? SHE'S A COP. SHE'S A COP, MAN! SHE'S A COP. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE OTHER BIG CONTENDER FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IS BERNIE SANDERS, WHO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JUST GETTING TO KNOW. AND IN AN INTERVIEW THIS WEEK, BERNIE SAID THAT HIS GREATEST WEAKNESS IS HE'S NOT AS SOCIABLE AS HE COULD BE. WHEN ASKED WHY, HE PICKED UP A A BANANA AND PRETENDED HE WAS TAKING A PHONE CALL. HE WAS LIKE, "AW, SORRY, I GOTTA TAKE THIS." HELLO? I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS -- I GOTTA GO." THIS IS PRETTY WEIRD, I READ THAT IN CHINA THIS WEEK THEY ARE HOSTING THE WORLD CUP SOCCER TOURNAMENT FOR ROBOTS, CALLED "ROBO CUP 2015." AND THE ENGINEER'S GOAL IS FOR ROBOTS TO FACE HUMANS IN THE REAL WORLD CUP BY 2050. THEN ROBOT SAID, "OH, NO, YOU'LL BE LONG GONE BY THEN." [ LAUGHTER ] CUTE. WELL, IT WAS A BIG WEEK FOR NEWS. WITH ALL THE TOP STORIES GETTING LOTS OF COVERAGE ONLINE. A LOT OF YOU GUYS MAY NOT KNOW THIS, BUT GOOGLE ACTUALLY KEEPS TRACK OF ITS MOST SEARCHED QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE STORIES.

YEAH. AND I THINK I'M TOTALLY THE GUY THAT'S SETTING -- I THINK I'M THE BOSS.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST A PERFECT CHARACTER FOR YOU.
OH, THANKS MAN.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE THE BOSS. YOU ARE THE BOSS.
THANKS.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, YEAH. BUT IT'S PERFECT WHEN YOU DO THAT CHARACTER. JUST SO LIKEABLE AND IT'S FUN TO WATCH.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S MICHAEL PENA IN "ANT-MAN." CHECK THIS OUT.
THANK YOU FOR THE COFFEE MAN. IT'S NOT TOO OFTEN THAT YOU ROB A PLACE AND THEN GET WELCOMED BACK. BECAUSE WE JUST ROBBED YOU.
YOU KNOW THAT HE WAS ARRESTED FOR STEALING A A SMOOTHIE MACHINE, RIGHT?
TWO SMOOTHIE MACHINES.
ARE YOU SURE THEY CAN HANDLE THIS?
OH, WE CAN HANDLE IT. WE'RE PROFESSIONALS.
YOU'LL FORGIVE US IF WE'RE NOT INSTILLED WITH CONFIDENCE.
HEY, EVERYBODY. JUST KICK BACK AND RELAX A A LITTLE BIT, MAN. WE KNOW OUR BUSINESS. WE BROKE INTO THIS SPOOKY-ASS HOUSE, DIDN'T WE?
I LET YOU.
ONE COULD SAY THAT I LET YOU LET ME.
LOOK, IT'S OKAY. THEY CAN HANDLE THIS.
YEAH. WE CAN HANDLE IT.
YOU GOT THEIR CREDENTIALS?
HE'S IN THE SYSTEM.
I'M IN THE SYS'EM? THE SYS'EM?
WE'RE DOOMED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: MICHAEL PENA, EVERYBODY. "ANT-MAN," "THE VATICAN TAPES" ARE BOTH IN THEATERS NOW. WE HAVE STAND-UP FROM ROBERT KLEIN, NEXT. STICK AROUND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WE ARE JOINED RIGHT NOW BY ONE OF THE GREATEST COMEDIANS OF ALL TIME. THE FIRST STANDUP TO TAPE AN HBO SPECIAL. HE'S BEEN NOMINATED FOR MULTIPLE TONY, EMMY, AND GRAMMY AWARDS. AND YOU CAN SEE HIM LIVE AT THE "COLONIAL THEATRE" IN PITTSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS ON SATURDAY, AUGUST 1st. MAKING HIS 87th APPEARANCE ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW," PLEASE GIVE A WARM WELCOME TO ROBERT KLEIN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
OH, THE MUSIC'S OVER. HI. YES, I LOOK IT, TOO, MY 87TH APPEARANCE. I HAVEN'T BEEN IN THIS STUDIO DOING "THE TONIGHT SHOW" SINCE 1973, AND NOW I RENEWED MY MEMBERSHIP TO AARP TODAY -- [ LAUGHTER ] MOSTLY FOR THE DISCOUNTS, YOU KNOW, THE EARLY BIRD SPECIAL. YOU GET THE BEST STEAK IN FT. LAUDERDALE FOR $7.99 WITH YOUR AARP CARD IF YOU'RE WILLING TO EAT AT 8:30 IN THE MORNING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU HAVE TO BE OUT BEFORE THE FULL PULP PEOPLE. THEY DON'T LIKE TO DEPRESS THEM. "MR. KLEIN, CAN YOU HAVE YOUR CORN ON THE COB ON YOUR COB, PLEASE? WE HAVE NORMAL PEOPLE COMING IN TO HAVE THEIR SUPPER." THE MAGAZINE IS IMPRESSIVE, THE AARP MAGAZINE. AND DISCOUNTS, OXYGEN, BURIALS, AND, FLOWERS. I PUT IT NEXT TO THE TOILET WITH THE HAMMOCK, THE SCHLEMMER AND "FIELD AND STREAM" AND THE "NORTH FACE" BECAUSE I'M AN OUTDOORSMAN. THAT'S MY THING. AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, WHEN I MOVE MY BOWELS, I LIKE TO PRICE KAYAKS. [ LAUGHTER ] I MAY NEVER HOPE TO OWN A A KAYAK, BUT I'LL KNOW THE BEST PRICES ON THOSE SUCKERS. THAT GIVES ME -- WHEN THERE'S A PADDLE SALE, YOU KNOW, I'LL HAVE A JUMP ON IT. OR WHEN I CLIMB EVEREST, I WANT TO SEE IF THOSE 4'7" HIMALAYAN-MOUNTAIN TENTS ARE ON SALE FOR WHEN I CLIMB EVEREST, LIKE EVERY OTHER MIDDLE AGED SCHMUCK WITH MONEY SEEMS TO BE DOING. THE MOUNTAIN IS LITTERED WITH THE FROZEN CORPSES OF DENTISTS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S 29,500 FEET. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? ANYWAY, DIG THIS. I MEAN, I'M NOT A KID ANYMORE, RIGHT? SO I'M CHECKING OUT AT THE SUPERMARKET. I'M HELPING TO GET HOME EARLIER. YOU KNOW, YOU PUT THE CANS IN FIRST, THEN YOU PUT THE TOMATOES. THE KID GOES, "YOUR DATE OF BIRTH, SIR?" "WHAT DO YOU NEED MY DATE OF BIRTH FOR?" "WELL, YOU PURCHASED A SIX-PACK OF BEER, SIR." [ LAUGHTER ] "WHAT'S YOUR NAME, RAYMUNDO? RAYMUNDO, I GOT UP SIX TIMES LAST NIGHT TO PEE, RAYMUNDO. I HAVE A PROSTATE THE SIZE OF A A ROCKY FORD CANTALOUPE. ALL RIGHT. THEY'RE DOING A PAPER ON ME AT MT. SINAI. THEY ARE THINKING SMITHSONIAN IF I'LL DONATE POSTHUMOUSLY, RAYMUNDO. I HAVE A TATTOO OF A VARICOSE VEIN ON MY LEG. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU WANT TO SEE IT? IT'S A GUY STAYED UP ALL NIGHT. IT LOOKS JUST LIKE A VARICOSE VEIN. NORMALLY, I CAN STRAIGHTEN OUT, RAYMUNDO. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. DO I KNOW YOU? IS THIS STOOL SOFTENER MINE? DO YOU HAVE MY CAR KEYS?" THEN, I HAVE TO GO OUT ON THE STREET. THE GREATEST HUMILIATION FOR GROWING OLDER, THIS NEW THING THEY HAVE WHEN YOU CROSS THE STREET, IT TELLS YOU HOW MANY SECONDS YOU HAVE. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE THIS QUICKSAND THING GOING THROUGH ME, YOU KNOW. 30. 22. FOUR. PLEASE, DON'T CUT OFF OLD PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE CROSSING. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND OF COURSE, WE HAVE END OF LIFE DECISIONS TO MAKE. NO, I'VE BEEN PERFECTLY HEALTHY. BUT, YOU KNOW, ONE THING ABOUT JEWS WE BURY QUICKLY. NO WAKES. JEWS DON'T HAVE WAKES. FIVE SHOWINGS A DAY, SIX -- IT'S LIKE VAUDEVILLE. A JEW DIES, ZOOM! INTO THE GROUND IN ONE SECOND. A JEW DIES, ZOOM! "WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO IRVING? HE WAS HERE A SECOND AGO. IRVING, WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?" "WE HAD TO BURY HIM. HE DIED. WE'RE JEWS." PREMATURE JEWISH BURIAL IS A A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM. THERE COULD BE SOME WISE THINGS IN THE BIBLE. "LET'S GO ON WITH LIFE. LET'S REMEMBER YOU AS YOU WERE. YOU'RE NOT AS INTERESTING AS YOU USED TO BE." I MEAN, THERE ARE THINGS. BUT I'LL TELL YOU, JEWS BURY SO QUICKLY THAT THE OLDER I GET AROUND MY RELATIVES, I'M AFRAID TO TAKE A NAP. LEST I BE MISTAKEN FOR, "POP! WE'VE GOT TO GO HOME, THE KIDS HAVE SCHOOL. POP? POP? POP? HE'S DEAD!" "I'M UP! I'M UP! DON'T YOU BURY ME, AGAIN!" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: JEWISH BURIAL. ROBERT KLEIN, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MORE WITH ROBERT KLEIN AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. THE ONE AND ONLY ROBERT KLEIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WE'RE HANGING OUT WITH ROBERT KLEIN. YOU CAN SEE HIS ACT LIVE SATURDAY, AUGUST 1ST AT THE COLONIAL THEATER IN PITTSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS. IT'S A TREAT. GO SEE ROBERT KLEIN LIVE. I'M SEEING YOU LIVE AND IT'S AMAZING. RIGHT NOW I'M SEEING YOU LIVE. I JUST SAW YOU LIVE RECENTLY WE WERE AT THE FRIARS CLUB AND WE HAD THE BEST TIME.
I TOOK SWOOSIE KURTZ FOR DINNER AT THE FRIARS CLUB. AND THERE'S JIMMY AND ALL THE WRITING STAFF. HE TREATS THEM TO MEMBERSHIP AND DINNER AT THE FRIARS CLUB. AND WE PARTIED UNTIL 2:30 IN THE AFTERNOON -- NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. WE DID. THAT'S RIGHT.
HE HAS A DEVICE WHERE HE HITS THE BUTTON AND EVERY SONG I EVER HEARD OF OR DIDN'T HEAR OF WE WERE BEE BOPPING AND DOO WOPPING.
Jimmy: DOO WOPPING. [ SINGING DOO WOP ] IT WAS SO FUN. THANK YOU FOR THAT. BUT, WE WERE TALKING, TRYING TO EXPLAIN TECHNOLOGY. 'CAUSE OF BLUETOOTH AND SPOTIFY AND THINGS. AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH TECHNOLOGY THE WAY ITS GOING NOW.
WELL, WHEN I WAS BORN, I MEAN, YOU KNOW -- I'VE SEEN MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE. I THINK ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE THINGS IS A A COLONOSCOPY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO ME?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S LIFESAVING. THERE'S ALMOST NO EXCUSE FOR COLON CANCER BECAUSE IF AN COLONOSCOPY. BUT, IT'S MORE SCIENCE FICTION TO ME. IT'S LIKE -- YOU KNOW ITS LIKE NOT ORSON WELLES, H.G. WELLS. IF SOME FUTURIST HAD TOLD ME IN 1965, YOU'RE FROM THE 21st CENTURY. THEY WILL BE PUTTING A A TELEVISION CAMERA RIGHT UP YOUR ASS INTO YOUR BODY CAVITY. YOU KNOW, YOU REMEMBER WHAT A A TELEVISION CAMERA LOOKED LIKE IN 1965. OUCH. IT IS. IT'S REAL TIME MEDICINE. AND IT'S A TELEVISION CAMERA IN THE HUMAN BODY. AND BECAUSE A LITTLE TECHNICALITY BECAUSE I'M A A SCREEN ACTORS GUILD MEMBER, HAIR AND MAKEUP HAD TO GO UP THERE, TOO.
Jimmy: YOU'RE WRONG IN DOING THIS. YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE HAIR AND MAKEUP.
YOU HEAR, CUT! QUIET ON THE SET. PEOPLE START GOING TO CRAMP SERVICES.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS AT ALL.
IT'S VERY COMPLICATED.
Jimmy: ROBERT, THIS IS THE 87th TIME.
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID. WHEN JOHNNY RETIRED AND I'M COUNTING THE FEW I DID WITH JAY. IT'S ABOUT 87. WITH SOME GUEST HOSTING AND STUFF.
Jimmy: WE'RE BACK IN NEW YORK.
I'M SO HAPPY.
Jimmy: IT ALL MAKES SENSE THAT YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE FIRST OF MANY. THE FIRST OF MANY. COME BACK WHENEVER YOU WANT TO. ROBERT KLEIN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. MY THANKS TO RACHEL McADAMS, MICHAEL PENA, THE ONE AND ONLY ROBERT KLEIN. AND THE ROOTS OVER THERE FROM PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA. STAY TUNED FOR "LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS." THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND. I HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT WEEK EVERYBODY. BYE BYE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
