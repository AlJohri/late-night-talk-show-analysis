OF COURSE IT'S THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE. IT JUST KEEPS GETTING MORE AND MORE TENSE. AND NOW VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS MOVED 10,000 TROOPS TO THE RUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN BORDER. YEAH. RUSSIA SAYS THE TROOPS ARE ONLY THERE FOR A TRAINING EXERCISE. WHEN ASKED WHAT THEY'RE TRAINING FOR, RUSSIAN OFFICIALS ARE LIKE INVADING UKRAINE. THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, 10,000 RUSSIAN TROOPS ON THE UKRAINIAN BORDER, THAT'S A LOT. PLUS INSIDE EACH OF THOSE SOLDIER IS A SLIGHTLY SMALLER SOLDIER, AND INSIDE THAT ONE THERE'S A SLIGHTLY SMALLER -- IT'S LIKE 40,000 TROOPS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] REALLY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] A LITTLE BORRIS. .
Steve: THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
Jimmy: I WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISED, A NEW POLL FOUND THAT MOST AMERICANS THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN IS A STRONGER LEADER THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA. AND YOU CAN TELL OBAMA IS TAKING THIS PERSONALLY. LOOK AT THE WAY HE SHOWED UP AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY. HE'S ON A BEAR -- [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S TRYING TOO HARD.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS ON OBAMA'S CASE RIGHT NOW. FACEBOOK FOUNDER MARK ZUCKERBERG APPARENTLY CALLED THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE NSA AND HOW IT SPIES ON ORDINARY AMERICANS. [ LAUGHTER ] CRAZY. YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT. THE GUY WHO RUNS FACEBOOK GOT MAD AT THE NSA FOR SPYING ON PEOPLE. TALK ABOUT THE POT UNFRIENDING THE KETTLE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE MARK ZUCKERBERG.

I LOVE EATING SPIDERS, CHEWING ON CANS, RIPPING OPEN SOGGY BOXES, WITH MY SMELLY TEETH. ALSO I'M THE MASCOT FOR A KIDS ENTERTAINMENT CENTER." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STOP TALKING. WENT OFF THE RAIL A LITTLE BIT. A LITTLE CRAZY. [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS PRETTY INTERESTING. A NEW SURVEY FOUND THAT 21% OF AMERICANS SAY RELIGION ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND THEN GOD SAID LOOKS LIKE 21% OF AMERICANS ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A REALLY BAD HAIR DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, HERE'S SOME SPORTS NEWS. AN ALASKA NATIVE JUST WON THE STATE'S IDIDAROD DOG SLEDDING RACE WITH A RECORD TIME OF EIGHT DAYS AND 13 HOURS. AFTERWARD HE SAID, "YES, WE DID IT!" AND HIS DOGS SAID, "WHO'S THIS WE?"

Jimmy: WHO PUSHED YOU?
THERESA PUSHED ME.
Jimmy: THERESA PUSHED YOU.
YES, SHE DID. I GOT PUSHED LIKE A RAG DOLL.

YES, YOU DID. [ LAUGHTER ] THE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SEE AT REUNIONS, AND I BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE PRESENT TODAY BECAUSE WHAT NO ONE KNOWS IS THAT WE DO THESE REUNIONS, AND WE TAPE FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. BUT WHEN WE TAKE A BREAK, I'LL BE LIKE, "OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK OR WHATEVER." LIKE THIS STORM, THIS FLOCK, THIS ARMY OF PEOPLE COME IN TO REAPPLY LIPSTICK AND MAKEUP AND IT'S LIKE AN ARMY. AND I'M LIKE, "WE'VE ONLY BEEN TALKING FOR TEN MINUTES." LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR LIPS?
Jimmy: NOTHING HAPPENED, YEAH. DO YOU LICK IT ALL OFF?
AND I THINK I BROUGHT YOU A A CLIP OF THAT.
Jimmy: OH, THIS IS SO NICE. BEHIND THE SCENES, HERE WE GO, THE REUNION.
AND ON THAT NOTE, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

Jimmy: I'M GOING TO BUY -- I'M GOING TO PURCHASE A TRUCK. AND I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT TRUCKS.
OKAY.
Jimmy: SO HERE TO HELP ME OUT, THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF "ROAD AND  TRACK" MAGAZINE, LARRY WEBSTER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

YEAH, THERE'S ONE TRUCK.
Jimmy: ONE TRUCK. JUST ONE?
IT'S A VINTAGE FORD BRONCO, WHICH IS SUPER COOL IF ANYBODY SEES IT. LIKE, STEVE McQUEEN COULD DRIVE THIS THING, IT'S THAT COOL.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD PULL THAT OFF. I COULD GET A VINTAGE TRUCK, MAYBE. DO YOU HAVE A TRUCK?
Andy: I DON'T HAVE A TRUCK, BUT YOU KNOW, PICKUP TRUCKS MAKE EVERYBODY LIKE TEN POINTS HOTTER.
Jimmy: WELL IT'S -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
IT'S TRUE.
Andy: MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE, YEAH.
IT'S A QUINTESSENTIAL -- I MEAN, IT IS AN AMERICAN VEHICLE, RIGHT?
Andy: YEAH.
IT'S ONE OF THEIR MOST POPULAR, IT'S THE BEST SELLING VEHICLE IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S THE FORD F-150. IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR OVER 35 YEARS.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
I MEAN, THEY'RE JUST COOL. THEY SAY SOMETHING ABOUT YOU. THEY'RE FUNCTIONAL, AND THEY'RE TERRIFIC.
Jimmy: YEAH, I NEED ONE. I NEED SOMETHING THAT SAYS ME. I THINK I'M A TRUCK TYPE OF DUDE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Andy: BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HAUL PUMPKINS. IS THAT THE IDEA?
Jimmy: LOOK, PUMPKIN SEASON COMES ONCE A YEAR.

Jimmy: YOU'RE GOING TO THROW IT IN THE BACK OF THE CAR? OR WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? STRAP IT IN WITH A SEATBELT? [ LAUGHTER ] RESPECT THE PUMPKIN, KEEP IT OUTDOORS.
PUT IT IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S PERFECT. WE CAN HELP YOU OUT THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO, BUT I HAVE A --
WELL, THE JOKE IS RIGHT -- THAT PICKUP TRUCK OWNERS ARE TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR SOMETHING.
Jimmy: NO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?
Andy: IS THAT THE JOKE?
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE. ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE ONE. I NARROWED IT DOWN. I NARROWED IT DOWN TO A FEW CARS HERE. THIS IS THE TOYOTA TACOMA. SOMEONE TOLD ME TO GET THIS GUY.
YEAH, PERFECT CHOICE.
Jimmy: BUT A TOYOTA SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT MADE IN AMERICA.
THAT ONE IS NOT. THEY HAVE A TUNDRA -- WHICH IS A BIGGER ONE THAT'S MADE IN AMERICA.
Jimmy: WHAT'S THIS GUY? THIS IS THE RAM -- THIS IS THE DODGE RAM.
WELL, IT'S NOT ACTUALLY CALLED DODGE RAM ANYMORE. IT'S JUST THE RAM 1500. THEY DROPPED THE DODGE
Jimmy: WHAT? THEY GOT OUT OF DODGE? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IS IT A GOOD TRUCK? IT'S TOO BIG?
Andy: IT'S TOO BIG.
WELL, NOW, HANG ON A SECOND. THEY'RE ALL THE SAME SIZE FROM NOW ON. IF YOU WANT TO GO SMALLER, THAT'S THE TACOMA. OR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR. CHEVY'S COMING OUT WITH A A SMALLER ONE CALLED THE COLORADO.
Jimmy: NOW, I DROVE THE SILVERADO. THIS IS THE KING RAMS. I LIKE THIS GUY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S WEARING KHAKIS. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE A BLUE SHIRT. IT LOOKS LIKE HE WORKS AT BEST BUY, THIS TRUCK. YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Andy: YOU'D LOOK GOOD IN THAT TRUCK.
Jimmy: I WOULD LOOK GOOD IN THAT TRUCK.
Andy: THAT COLOR IS A GOOD COLOR FOR YOU.
Jimmy: THIS WOULD BE MY COLOR.
Andy: YEAH, I THINK YOUR EYES WOULD POP.
Jimmy: YEAH. I WOULD TOTALLY LIKE DRIVE BY YOUR HOUSE. AND HONK THE HORN.
Andy: YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I'M NOT SURE I'M BIG ON THE TWO TONE.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
NAH. THAT'S UP TO YOU. THAT'S PERSONAL.
Jimmy: OH, GETTING NERDY, GETTING NERDY, PLEASE. YOU'RE NOT INTO THE TWO TONE. HOW ABOUT THIS GUY? THIS IS THE FORD F-150 PLATINUM. A LITTLE TOO SERIOUS, RIGHT? [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WAIT, YOU LIKE THAT?
YOU WANT THE PLATINUM.
Jimmy: YOU DO?

ACTUALLY, YOU CAN IN THE FORD. I DON'T THINK, BUT YOU CAN GET IT IN
Andy: IS T PUMPKIN?
YEAH.
Jimmy: WELL, ALSO, I HAVE A A BABY AS WELL. SO, I WANT TO PUT THE BABY --
Jimmy: WE'RE NOT PUTTING THE BABY IN THE TRUCK. BUT I'M SAYING IN THE BACK. I WANT TO GET AN EXTENDED CAB, RIGHT?
WELL, YOU WANT ACTUALLY WHAT'S CALLED A CREW CAB. BECAUSE THAT HAS FOUR DOORS. AND IT GETS A LITTLE COMPLICATED. BECAUSE THE PICKUP TRUCK IS THE MOST VERSATILE VEHICLE SOLD. YOU CAN GET THEM LONG BED, SHORT BED, FOUR DOORS, TWO DOORS, TWO AND A HALF DOORS -- I MEAN, YOU CAN GET --
Jimmy: WHY WOULD I WANT A A SHORT BED?
WELL, BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT IT SO LONG THAT IT MAKES IT HARD TO PARK.
Jimmy: OH, PLEASE.
YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] COME ON. ON THE SHORT BED IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S JUST A-- I MEAN, YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST HAVE A TRUNK OF A A CAR AND JUST CALL IT AN SUV. I MEAN, WHY EVEN HAVE A TRUCK?
WELL, THE SHORT BEDS ARE STILL -- THEY'RE LIKE SIX FEET LONG.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT.
WHAT, ARE YOU TAKING PLYWOOD? YOU FIXING YOUR HOUSE UP? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Jimmy: NOT SURE YET, BUT DEFINITELY PUMPKINS. [ LAUGHTER ] START OUT WITH PUMPKINS. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS I HAVE A PRETTY DECENT SIZED PUMPKIN, YOU KNOW?
YES. YES, YES.
Jimmy: AND WHAT IF I WANT TO DRIVE ON THE BEACH? WHAT IF I WANT TO DO THAT?
ANY OF THESE WILL DO IT. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOWER YOUR TIRE PRESSURE A LITTLE BIT. JUST SO YOU DON'T GET STUCK.
Jimmy: NO PRESSURE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
NO, IT'S EASY. I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT.
Jimmy: BUT THEN DO I HAVE TO RAISE THE TIRE PRESSURE BACK UP TO DRIVE --
YEAH, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO.
Andy: ABSO
Jimmy: WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE I SHOULDN'T GET A TRUCK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MAYBE I SHOULD GET A SUV, YEAH.
Andy: I THINK MAYBE A A VINTAGE TRUCK.
WAIT, WAIT, HOLD ON A SECOND THOUGH. YOU CAN'T FILL YOUR TIRES WITH AIR?
Jimmy: NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
REALLY?
Jimmy: ME, NO. I CAN BARELY PUMP A BICYCLE TIRE.
IT'LL TAKE LIKE TWO SECONDS. I CAN HELP YOU.
Jimmy: I'M A MORON. NO, I MEAN, I COULD DO IT.
YOU KNOW, THESE PLACES LIKE IN NANTUCKET. OR DOWN IN NORTH CAROLINA WHERE YOU DRIVE ON THE BEACH -- AND EVERYBODY DOES IT -- THEY LOWER THE TIRE PRESSURE. THEY GO ON THE SAND, THEY HAVE A GREAT TIME. THEY DRIVE RIGHT UP TO THE WATER. AND THEN USUALLY THE PLACE THAT YOU LEAVE THE BEACH, THEY HAVE A PUMP THERE.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
AND YOU CAN JUST GO PUMP THE TIRES BACK UP AND AWAY YOU GO.
Jimmy: I THINK YOU'RE MAKING THAT UP, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, IT'S NOT REAL.
