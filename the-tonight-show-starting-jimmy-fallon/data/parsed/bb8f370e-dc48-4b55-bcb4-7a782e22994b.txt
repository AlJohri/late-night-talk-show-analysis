Jimmy: HEY! THAT FEELS GOOD. THANK YOU! OH, PLEASE, WELCOME! HI! WELCOME! THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT A WARM WELCOME RIGHT THERE. OH, MY GOSH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I APPRECIATE THAT. HAPPY FRIDAY. WE'VE ALMOST DONE A WHOLE WEEK OF "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU, AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
WE LOVE YOU, JIMMY!
Jimmy: I LOVE YOU, TOO. WELCOME. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. AFTER 16 DAYS OF COMPETITION, THE CLOSING CEREMONIES FOR THE WINTER OLYMPICS IS THIS SUNDAY. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
Jimmy: VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS LIKE -- [ WITH RUSSIAN ACCENT ] "IT HAS BEEN SOME TIME, AND I'M SAD TO SEE EVERYONE ESCAPE. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, GET AWAY. I MEAN, GO HOME. IT'S A SAD DAY FOR ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DON'T LEAVE." THERE'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY BIG SCANDAL RIGHT NOW IN SOCHI. TODAY, GERMANY'S OLYMPIC COMMITTEE -- THEY ANNOUNCED THAT ONE OF ITS FEMALE ATHLETES WAS CAUGHT DOPING. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] YEAH. THEY COULD TELL SOMETHING WAS WRONG WHEN SHE TOOK HER URINE TEST STANDING UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WOW! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SOMETHING RIGHT THERE.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: RED FLAG.
Steve: SHE'S EUROPEAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: UM -- [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED TO COMMENT, THE WOMAN WAS LIKE -- [ AS SCHWARZENEGGER ] "THAT WAS COMPLETELY UNTRUE. THIS IS THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD. WHY IS EVERYONE -- I'M A LITTLE GIRL! I'M A LITTLE GIRL. I SING IN HAIR BRUSHES AND I PUT HARRY STYLES ON THE WALL. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?" [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THAT'S RIGHT. THE OLYMPICS ARE WINDING DOWN IN RUSSIA. BOY, IT'S BEEN FUN. ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE NOTICED IS HOW THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS PRETTY TIGHT CONTROL OVER THE MEDIA. ESPECIALLY TV NEWS. I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LOCAL NEWS FROM SOCHI. I THINK THEY DID SOMETHING TO THIS. [ SPEAKING RUSSIAN ]
Translator: HELLO. MY NAME IS JEFF MARTINEZ. SO FAR THE OLYMPICS IN SOCHI, RUSSIA HAVE BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS. DESPITE THE WEATHER, THE MOUNTAINS STILL HAVE GREAT SNOW. I USED TO TOBOGGAN WITH MY BROTHER, JEREMY. ONE TIME HE DUMPED SOME SNOW DOWN MY SNOW PANTS AND YELLED, "ICE ICE BABY" AND THEN SHOVED ME DOWN THE HILL. AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, WHEE, CHILLY CHEEKS! I'VE GOT CHILLY CHEEKS." ANYWAY, THE OLYMPICS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH SUNDAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HE SOUNDED A LITTLE OFF. I DON'T BELIEVE HE SAID THAT. I'VE GOT CHILLY CHEEKS? DID YOU SEE THIS? DURING A TOWN HALL YESTERDAY, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE -- HE'S OUR PAL, VERY FUNNY GUY, VERY QUICK GUY. WELL, HE WAS AT THIS TOWN HALL AND HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE SLOW PACE OF HIS WEIGHT LOSS. AND HE SAID, QUOTE, "ROME WAS NOT UNBUILT IN A DAY." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A GOOD LINE. THAT'S A GREAT LINE. YEAH, VERY FUNNY. IN FACT, CHRISTIE AND ROME HAVE A LOT IN COMMON. ONE WAS BUILT BY JULIUS CAESAR, THE OTHER BUILT BY LITTLE CAESAR. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] PIZZA-PIZZA.
Steve: PIZZA-PIZZA.
Jimmy: BUT DURING THE SAME TOWN HALL, CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID THAT HE IS STILL HOLDING OUT HOPE THAT HE AND BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN CAN BE FRIENDS. IN RESPONSE, SPRINGSTEEN WAS LIKE, "ONE, TWO, THREE, NO." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MAYBE THEY COULD. THEY COULD BE FRIENDS. MAJOR BUSINESS NEWS. THIS WEEK FACEBOOK BOUGHT A A MESSAGING APP CALLED "WHATSAPP." [ LAUGHTER ] WHATSAPP, FOR $19 BILLION. IN AN EFFORT TO HOLD ON TO TEENAGERS WHO NO LONGER THINK FACEBOOK IS COOL. YEAH, WHATSAPP. [ LAUGHTER ] NOTHING SAYS COOL LIKE AN APP NAMED AFTER A BUDWEISER COMMERCIAL FROM THE '90s. [ LAUGHTER ] WHATSAPP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I JUST WANT TO KNOW, BECAUSE I CURRENTLY HAVE THE APP -- "YO QUIERO TACO" APP. IT'S FOR SALE. $5 BILLION. THAT'S ALL. I'M ONLY ASKING $5 BILLION. [ LAUGHTER ] YO QUIERO TACO APP.
Steve: YEP.
Jimmy: YEP. REALLY COOL MAN. THIS DOESN'T REALLY SURPRISE ME. I SAW A NEW SURVEY FOUND THAT 25% OF AMERICANS ADMIT TO COMING TO WORK EVEN WHEN THEY'RE SICK. YEP, PEOPLE HERE AT NBC DO IT ALL OF THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] HI. HOW ARE YOU, BOB COSTAS. [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD LUCK IN THE GAME. TAKE CARE. [ APPLAUSE ] PINK EYE'S NOT CONTAGIOUS, IS IT? POOR BOB COSTAS. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T WAIT TO TALK TO HIM. I'VE FEEL SO BAD FOR THAT GUY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] GET THIS. SOUTH KOREA IS COMING OUT WITH ITS OWN VERSION OF THE DRAMA "HOMELAND" THAT WILL FOCUS ON ITS CONFLICT WITH NORTH KOREA. [ LAUGHTER ] AND ACTUALLY, THIS IS A FAIRLY COMMON THING FOR OTHER COUNTRIES TO ADAPT AMERICAN TV SHOWS. IN FACT, NORTH KOREA IS ACTUALLY ADAPTING THEIR OWN VERSIONS OF WELL-KNOWN AMERICAN SHOWS. CHECK IT OUT. THERE'S "UNFELD." [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT WE HAVE "KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHI-HOONS" AND FINALLY WE HAVE "THE FRESH PRINCE OF PYONGYANG." [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD SHOWS, GOOD WRITERS, GOOD DIRECTORS. [ APPLAUSE ] THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD IDEA, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE WINTERS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING. I READ THAT SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST AIRPORTS ARE LOOKING INTO ADDING HEATED RUNWAYS TO CUT DOWN ON WEATHER DELAYS DURING THE WINTER. [ APPLAUSE ] I THINK IT'S GREAT FOR PASSENGERS. GREAT FOR PASSENGERS. KIND OF SUCKS FOR THAT GUY DIRECTING THE PLANE TRAFFIC, THOUGH. HE'S LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHERE TO PARK! JUST PARK IT! COME ON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IS THAT HOW YOU STEER A PLANE? I HAVE NO IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ] IT IS WITH YOUR FEET, RIGHT?
Steve: WHAT'S THAT?
Jimmy: DON'T YOU STEER IT WITH YOUR FEET?
Steve: NO, YOU DO IT WITH THE LITTLE WHEEL UP FRONT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU THINK THAT WINK MADE ME BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? [ LAUGHTER ] THE LITTLE WHEEL?
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: THEY DON'T HAVE A A LITTLE WHEEL.
Steve: YEAH, THEY DO.
Jimmy: STOP WINKING! [ LAUGHTER ] STOP WINKING AT PEOPLE.
Steve: WHAT?

Jimmy: SO ANYWAY, THE STAGE STARTS -- IT JUST STARTS MOVING AND GROWING. AND THEN, YOU GET LIKE -- YOU'RE, LIKE, 30 FEET TALL. YOU'RE UP IN THE AIR. I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH." I GUESS. THAT'S COOL. NO, IT STARTS MOVING TOWARDS YOU. AND I GO, "WHAT?" SO THE STAGE GOES OVER YOUR HEAD.
I WISH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD THAT PART BUT THAT'S FINE. [ AUDIENCE AWWS ]
Jimmy: WAIT, BUT I HAVE TO KEEP GOING.
OKAY.
Jimmy: I'LL GO LIKE THIS WHEN YOU CAN MOVE YOUR VOLUME BACK UP.
THEY CAN'T HEAR THAT IF THEIR VOLUME'S DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] [ RIM SHOT ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IF YOU DID TURN THE VOLUME DOWN, THEY THINK THAT YOU GIVE PROSTATE EXAMS IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR CONCERT. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
AND COUGH.
Jimmy: THERE'S NOT A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE. AND WHEN I WAS THERE, I HAD SHOWS BECAUSE I WAS WITH YOUR PAL.
MM-HMM. I WAS WITH TRACE AND HE WAS TAKING CARE OF ME.

Jimmy: YEAH. IN THE GUEST HOUSE. IN THE SAME AREA.
HE WAS WITH HIS WIFE. I WAS WITH MINE.
Jimmy: NO ONE TOUCHED EACH OTHER.
THERE WASN'T A HOT TUB IN MILES.
Jimmy: NO, NO. WE DIDN'T NEED A HOT TUB.
NOT A HOT TUB IN MILES. BUT THE TRUTH IS, ME AND MY WIFE DID DRINK YOU OUT OF, LIKE, ALL OF YOUR LIQUOR, SO --
Jimmy: IT WAS FUN.
