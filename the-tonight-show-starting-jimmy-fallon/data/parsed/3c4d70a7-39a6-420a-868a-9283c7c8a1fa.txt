GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.
I'M STILL JUST MARVELING AT OUR LITTLE RE-ENACTION THERE OF "THE BACHELOR." "THE BACHELORETTE."
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S THE BEST THING. I MEAN, YEAH. THERE'S -- THAT'S A SPINOFF RIGHT THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH, GIVE IT UP! GIVE IT UP.
Jimmy: THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
TAKING IT IN. HOW YOU DOING, BUD?
Jimmy: YOU'VE SEEN THE ROOTS ON --.
THREE CONTINENTS. THEY'RE THE ONLY BAND THAT I'VE SEEN ON THREE DIFFERENT CONTINENTS ON THIS EARTH OF OURS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WORLD-FAMOUS ROOTS CREW. YEAH.
Jimmy: I KNOW YOU LOVE MUSIC --
I'M A HUGE MUSIC FAN. I MEAN, I'VE GONE SO FAR AS TO HOST A BAND AT MY -- AT MY HOUSE. THERE WAS A -- WHEN I WAS LIVING IN DALLAS, TEXAS ON "THE GOOD GUYS," THERE WAS BAND I DISCOVERED AT "SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST." IT'S A GREAT GROUP, CALLED J RODDY WALSTON AND THE BUSINESS. AND A FEW MONTHS LATER THEY WERE PLAYING -- THEY WERE COMING THROUGH DALLAS AND THEY WERE PLAYING AT A VENUE JUST A A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE LOFT THAT I WAS STAYING AT, SO I OFFERED THEM A PLACE TO STAY. BECAUSE THEY WERE A SORT OF YOUNG GROUP. AND THEY WERE SLEEPING ON COUCHES ESSENTIALLY SO --
Jimmy: SURE.
COME STAY AT MY PLACE. SO THEY UH -- THEY CAME OVER TO MY SPOT. AND WE HAD A FEW DRINKS AND A A FEW DRINKS AND A FEW DRINKS. AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE 4:30 IN THE MORNING, AND I'M, LIKE, "YEAH, I GOT TO BE UP EARLY TOMORROW."
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO I GO TO BED AND THEY -- THEY JUST HAD, GOTTEN A NEW BASS PLAYER AND HE WAS SLEEPING ON THE COUCH. AND YOU SORT OF SAY GOOD NIGHT. AND THEN A FEW HOURS LATER I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING -- THE BASS PLAYER HAD MOVED OVER TO -- WALKED TO MY BED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] TOOK A -- PAIR OF MY JEANS, AND WAS, LIKE, SNUGGLING WITH IT -- LIKE A BLANKET.
Jimmy: WERE YOU NEAR BED?
I WAS IN THE BED! [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS MY BED!
Jimmy: HE WAS ON TOP OF YOU?
NO. HE WAS JUST RIGHT NEXT TO ME. IT WAS A QUEEN SIZE BED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO.
AND SO I WOKE UP, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, LOGAN, THE NEW GUY, IS SITTING THERE, SLEEPING NEXT TO ME. AND I JUST WAIT FOR EVERYBODY TO WAKE UP. AND I JUST SAID, "YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT I FOUND THIS MORNING." THEY GO, "WHAT?" I SAID, "YOUR NEW BASS PLAYER." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S ALWAYS THE BASS PLAYER.
IT'S ALWAYS THE BASS PLAYER.
Jimmy: IT'S ALWAYS THE BASS PLAYER.
ALWAYS THE BASS PLAYER YEAH, HE ALWAYS ENDS UP -- YEAH, EXACTLY. IT ALWAYS IS. BUT YOU -- YOU'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD, RIGHT? YOU'VE BEEN ON TOUR ONCE, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE PALS WITH JACK BLACK. YOU'VE BEEN IN A COUPLE --
YEAH. "TENACIOUS D," YEAH.
Jimmy: "TENACIOUS D" IT WAS FANTASTIC.
YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I WAS IN THE "TENACIOUS D" MOVIE. I WAS IN "ORANGE COUNTY" WITH THEM. I WAS IN "KING KONG" WITH THEM. AND AFTER "ORANGE COUNTY" I ACTUALLY WENT OUT ON THE ROAD WITH "TENACIOUS D."
Jimmy: THEY ARE AMAZING!
THEY'RE AWESOME!
Jimmy: SEE IT LIVE IF YOU CAN EVER GET A CHANCE TO SEE THEM --
GREATEST BAND ON THE EARTH. NO OFFENSE TO "THE ROOTS."
Jimmy: NO, OF COURSE. NO, THEY'RE --
BUT, YEAH, NO --
Jimmy: YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THEM ON THREE CONTINENTS.
I HAVEN'T -- YEAH. BUT THEY ACTUALLY -- EARLIER ON WHEN THEY WERE OPENING UP FOR "WEEZER" AND I WENT OUT AND FOLLOWED THEM ON TOUR, JACK SAID, "HEY, DO YOU WANT TO COME MEET US ON THE ROAD?" I SAID, "YEAH, SURE. I'D LOVE TO." HE SAYS, "OKAY. I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO BRING A ROBIN HOOD OUTFIT."
Jimmy: YEAH, THIS IS PERFECT. IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. AND I WAS, LIKE, "OH, OKAY. LIKE, LIKE A GOOD --" "I DON'T CARE IF IT'S GOOD. JUST GET A ROBIN HOOD OUTFIT." SO I WENT AND BOUGHT A A ROBIN HOOD COSTUME BUT IT WAS A CHEAP ONE. IT WAS, LIKE, YOU KNOW, MADE OF, LIKE, A TABLECLOTH MATERIAL ALMOST. IT WAS LIKE FELT. IT WAS VERY - IT WAS JUST A VERY CHEAP COSTUME, BECAUSE I'M -- I'M A A CHEAP DATE. AND UM -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND IT WAS SO BAD THAT AFTERWARDS, EVERYBODY WHO SAW ME, THEY WERE LIKE, "HEY, YOU'RE PETER PAN, UP THERE ON STAGE!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I GO, "NO. IT'S ROBIN HOOD! WEREN'T YOU PAYING ATTENTION?"
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
PETER PAN DOES NOT ROB FROM THE RICH AND GIVE TO THE POOR. PETER PAN, LIKE, FLIES AROUND AND DOES SOMETHING ELSE! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I FORGET WHAT HE DOES.
THAT WAS -- THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE GOING OUT ON THE ROAD WITH TENACIOUS D.
Jimmy: LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS NEW DOCUMENTARY. BECAUSE I SAW YOUR OTHER DOCUMENTARY YOU DID ABOUT TOWER RECORDS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND I LOVED IT. OH, MY GOSH.
OH, THANKS, MAN.
Jimmy: MAN, IT WAS GREAT. BUT THIS ONE IS, "EAGLES OF DEATH METAL."
YEAH.
Jimmy: IS IT NOS AMIS"?
YEAH. WHICH IS FRENCH FOR, "OUR FRIENDS."
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND IT'S REALLY, YOU KNOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY KNOW "EAGLES OF DEATH METAL" WERE THE BAND PLAYING AT LE BATACLAN DURING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN PARIS.
Jimmy: YEAH, REALLY.
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES AT THE SHOW. AND THE GUYS ARE ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. I'VE KNOWN JESSE AND JOSH, THE TWO PRIMARY MEMBERS OF THE BANDS FOR A LONG TIME NOW AND I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR A WAY TO HELP THEM IN A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TIME, AND THEY WERE GOING BACK THREE MONTHS AFTER THE ATTACKS, THEY WERE GOING BACK TO GO FINISH THE SHOW THAT THEY -- THAT THEY PLAYED, AND FINISH THEIR TOUR. AND I THOUGHT THAT THAT MIGHT BE A VERY INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND DOCUMENT THAT CONCERT AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT EVERYONE WAS GOING THROUGH AT THE TIME. AND IT WAS A REALLY POWERFUL EVENING, BUT, REALLY, IT'S A A FILM ABOUT FRIENDSHIP. YOU KNOW? JESSE AND JOSH HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE THEY WERE LITTLE KIDS AND ALWAYS REFER TO THEIR FANS AS THEIR FRIENDS. THESE ARE PEOPLE THEY'VE KNOWN FOR 15 YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN COMING TO THEIR SHOW. SO -- IT'S REALLY AN UPLIFTING STORY ABOUT FRIENDSHIP AND I JUST THINK THE WORLD OF THOSE GUYS AND WANT TO HELP THEM ANYWAY I CAN.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW A A CLIP. HERE'S A SCENE FROM -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] COLIN HANKS' LATEST DOCUMENTARY, "EAGLES OF DEATH METAL: NOS AMIS." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS GOING BACK TO PARIS. LIKE, WHAT DO YOU WANT THIS TRIP TO BE?
THE RETURN TO PARIS IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT I'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE. I TAKE IT AS A HOLY CHARGE. THIS DUTY OF LEADERSHIP THAT I'VE BEEN ELECTED TO BY CIRCUMSTANCE. SO I CANNOT WAIT TO GET BACK. I ALSO LOVE ROCK 'N' ROLL. I LOVE WHAT I DO. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK TO IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: COLIN HANKS, "EAGLES OF DEATH METAL: NOS AMIS." PREMIERES FEBRUARY 13th ON HBO. HEY, CONGRATS AGAIN ON "LIFE IN PIECES."
