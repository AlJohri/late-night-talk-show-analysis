Questlove: 183.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS -- JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: A HOT CROWD. HOT CROWD TONIGHT! WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELLCOME. WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE "TONIGHT SHOW" EVERYBODY. IT'S A HOT SHOW TONIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE FUN. BUT FIRST, LET'S GET TO NEWS STORIES HERE. BIG STORY, SONY PICTURES HAS OFFICIALLY CANCELLED THE RELEASE OF "THE INTERVIEW" DUE TO CONTINUED THREATS FROM THE HACKERS. [ AUDIENCE BOOS ] YEAH, WHICH MEANS THE HACKERS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THEIR GOAL OF MAKING EVERYONE IN THE WORLD WANT TO SEE "THE INTERVIEW." [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, WASN'T PLANNING, NOW I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT. SEEMS LIKE EVERYONES WEIGHING IN ON THE MOVIE'S CANCELATION. MITT ROMNEY SUGGESTED THAT THE FILM SHOULD BE LEASED ONLINE FOR FREE. [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ] DONALD TRUMP SAYS, "THE STUDIO HAS NO COURAGE OR GUTS." [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CHRIS CHRISTIE SAID "EITHER WAY, I'M HAVING A LARGE BUCKET OF POPCORN." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S IT. IF I DON'T, THEN THE TERRORISTS HAVE WON. [ LAUGHTER ] ONE? I MEANT TWO. TWO, WHY NOT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OF COURSE THE OTHER BIG NEWS RIGHT NOW IS THE U.S. RENEWING ITS RELATIONS WITH CUBA. NOT IF YOU HEARD THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] CUBAN PRESIDENT, RAUL CASTRO, STATED THAT THE U.S. AND CUBA WILL WORK TOGETHER SAYING QUOTE, "WE HAVE TO LEARN THE ART OF LIVING TOGETHER WITH OUR DIFFERENCES IN A CIVILIZED WAY." WHILE FIDEL CASTRO SAID, "HOW AM I STILL ALIVE? HOW OLD AM? I GOT TO BE LIKE 200 YEARS OLD, RIGHT? SERIOUSLY, HOW OLD AM I?" [ APPLAUSE ] YOU GUYS SEE THIS? AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCES THE U.S. WILL WORK TO RESTORE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH CUBA, THE SHARES OF BIG CRUISE LINE COMPANIES INCREASED. YEAH. OF COURSE, CUBANS WILL BE PRETTY CONFUSED 'CAUSE IT'LL THE FIRST TIME TO SEE A BOAT FULL OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T TRYING TO ESCAPE. [ LAUGHTER ] "WHY ARE THEY COMING TOWARD US? YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY!" [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GUYS HEAR THIS. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, PRESIDENT OBAMA REVEALED THAT HIS FAVORITE MOVIE OF THIS YEAR WAS "BOYHOOD." MAKES SENSE. IF THERE'S ONE THING OBAMA CAN IDENTIFY WITH IT'S AGING SEVERAL YEARS OVER THE COURSE OF A COUPLE HOURS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT HIS FAVORITE MOVIE THIS YEAR WAS "BOYHOOD." WHEN ASKED WHAT HIS SECOND FAVORITE MOVIE, HE WAS LIKE, "THE INTERVIEW," I MEAN "INTERSTELLAR." "INTERSTELLAR." I DIDN'T SEE "THE INTERVIEW." NO ONE SAW "THE INTERVIEW." [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, 2014 HAS BEEN A A PRETTY ROUGH YEAR FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA. IT'S REALLY STARTING TO SEEM LIKE THE JOB'S GETTING TO HIM. I DON'T WANT TO SAY HE'S GIVING UP. BUT -- TAKE A LOOK AT THE TALKING POINTS AS THE MONTHS HAVE GONE ON. I THINK YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN. WATCH THIS.
WITH OUR FEET PLANTED FIRMLY IN TODAY BUT OUR EYES CAST TOWARD TOMORROW, I KNOW IT IS WITHIN OUR REACH. THIS IS THE BEGINNING, NOT THE END. WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE RAIL WE HAVE GOT TO LAY. WE HAVE A WELL THOUGHT OUT -- PROCESS. WE STILL LIVE IN A -- FREE MARKET SOCIETY. THE CONSTITUTIONS INTACT BUT -- I LOVE SHAKING HANDS, AND GETTING HUGS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ] MICHELLE IS LIKE, "MAYBE WE WON'T SEND TO YOU THE A HOLIDAY NEWSLETTER THIS YEAR." TAKE THIS YEAR OFF. LISTEN TO THIS, GUYS. A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS THAT OFFICE HOLIDAY PARTIES COULD LEAD TO AFFAIRS, WHICH IS LARGELY DUE TO THE ALCOHOL THAT IS NORMALLY SERVED. IT'S NEVER GOOD. I MEAN, BACK BEFORE I GOT MARRIED, I HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK AND KISSED A A CO-WORKER. IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE.
Steve: FOR YOU MAYBE. [ LAUGHTER ] BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE. CAN'T FIRE ME NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: DID YOU SEE THIS VIDEO? THIS IS GOING VIRAL TODAY. A WOMAN IN WISCONSIN -- OH MAN, PEOPLE ARE AWESOME. A WOMAN IN WISCONSIN HAS BEEN GOING ON WALKS WITH HER DOG. SHE'S DRESSED AS THE ABDOMINAL SNOWMAN -- [ LAUGHTER ] FOR THE CARTOON "RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER". THIS IS REAL. SHE WANTS TO SPREAD HOLIDAY CHEER, I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORKING.

AFTER THAT, HE GOT INTO A A SLEIGH AND FLEW OFF LIKE THE DOWN OF A THISTLE, WHATEVER THE [ BLEEP ] THAT MEANS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: TO SAY THE LEAST. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT? WHAT IS IT --
IT REPRESENTS A FEW DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES, THE FIRST IS BARRELING INTO A A SITUATION, REGARDLESS OF THE INTELLIGENCE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN GATHERED ON YOUR BEHALF. ALA OUR FORMER PRESIDENT, GEORGE W. BUSH. YOU KNOW, IGNORE WHAT ROMNEY IS SAYING AND JUST HEAD RIGHT INTO THE CHINA SHOP, AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND.
Jimmy: THAT'S FULL BUSH.

MY DAD IS AN INCREDIBLE AND GENEROUS CRAFTSMAN. HE IS CONSTANTLY -- HE RETIRED FROM SCHOOL TEACHING YEARS AGO. AND HE IS ONE OF THOSE GUYS WHO WHEN HE RETIRED, HE WAS LIKE, "FINALLY, NOW I CAN WORK 14-HOUR DAYS." [ LAUGHTER ]

HE IS THE GUY WHO DROPS OFF A BOX OF TOMATOES ON, LIKE, EVERY PORCH IN TOWN.
Jimmy: YOU LOVE PEOPLE LIKE THAT, RIGHT.

[ LAUGHTER ] AND FILLING MY PANTS WITH OATMEAL. THE SADDEST -- THE SADDEST OATMEAL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE SADDEST OATMEAL. THAT'S HILARIOUS.
IT WAS A FULL CATHARSIS.
Jimmy: YOU JUST WENT FOR IT. I MEAN, DID YOU KNOW LIKE -- WHEN YOU SAID YOUR LAST LINE, LIKE THAT'S IT, I WILL NEVER SAY ANY MORE LINES?
IT'S FUNNY, NO. YOU WOULD THINK I WOULD HAVE NOTICED, BUT WE -- ON THE LAST DAY, WE FINISHED WITH A FEW SCENES WITH EVERYBODY IN THEM. AND WE WERE ON THE, LIKE, LAST COUPLE OF SCENES. AND AZIZ AND I WERE KIND OF, YOU KNOW, GETTING READY AND WERE IN THE CROWD OF THE SCENE. AND WE SAID, "OH, MY GOD, WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE LINES. WE'VE ALREADY SPOKEN OUR LAST DIALOGUE."
Jimmy: YEAH, WHERE WERE WE? WHAT WAS OUR LAST LINE? OH NO.
DANG IT!
Jimmy: I SHOULD'VE ENJOYED IT MORE, YEAH.
I'VE BEEN STANDING HERE LISTENING TO AMY TALK. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SO AZIZ SUGGESTED THAT, AT THE END OF THE SCENE, AMY AND AUBREY WOULD LEAVE, AND SO WE BEGAN TO JUST SAY, "BYE, GUYS." [ LAUGHTER ] SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A SOLID LAST LINE.
