I WAS JUST SUPPOSED TO SING SOMETHING FROM "THE HEIGHTS." I SANG "HAMILTON" INSTEAD.
WHEN YOU TOLD US, "WELL, I'M GOING TO DO A RAP ABOUT ALEXANDER HAMILTON," WE SAID, "WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT." [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S THE TYPICAL REACTION.
AND AFTER THE PERFORMANCE, I THINK, ALL OF US UNDERSTOOD NOT ONLY HOW MUCH POTENTIAL IT HAD, BUT WHAT IT DID WAS CAPTURE THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, THE FOUNDING FATHERS WERE, TO SOME DEGREE, FLYING BY THE SEATS OF THEIR PANTS.
ABSOLUTELY.
AND MAKING IT UP AS THEY WENT ALONG.
YEAH.
AND THE FACT THAT THE EXPERIMENT WORKED WAS A A TESTIMONY TO THEIR GENIUS AND YOU CAN DRAW A DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT THE FOUNDERS WERE DOING AND WHAT WE DO TODAY.
YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HOW COOL IS THAT?
THAT WAS REALLY COOL.
Jimmy: HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
YEAH.
Jimmy: LAST TIME YOU WERE ON THE SHOW, WE DID A THING OF -- A WHEEL OF FREE STYLE, AND A A LOT OF PEOPLE WENT -- IT WAS ONLINE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE LIKE, "OH, YOU REHEARSED THAT AND YOU WROTE THAT WHOLE THING UP."
