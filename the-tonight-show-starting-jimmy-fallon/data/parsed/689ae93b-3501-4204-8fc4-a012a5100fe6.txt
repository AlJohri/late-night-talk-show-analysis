Questlove: 385, SALT LAKE!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST. AWE. ONE OF THE BEST FEELINGS EVER. I LOVE IT. I LOVE THAT. THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD. THAT'S THE TYPE OF AUDIENCE YOU WANT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED. GREAT NEW YORK CITY CROWD. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. YOU MADE IT. THIS IS "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "THE TONIGHT SHOW," YOU'RE HERE. OH, IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. YOU GUYS, WE HAVE THE VERY FUNNY JIM GAFFIGAN HERE TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: YEAH!
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT. JIM GAFFIGAN, THE ONLY PERSON IN AMERICA THAT DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY CALLS TOO WHITE. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT -- YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. TRUMP CONTINUES TO BE THE BIG STORY, EVERYBODY. AND I SAW THAT AFTER HIS RECENT COMMENTS ABOUT MUSLIMS, DONALD TRUMP WAS FIRED AS A A GLOBAL AMBASSADOR FOR SCOTLAND. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS IRONIC, BECAUSE IF THERE EVER WAS A HUMAN VERSION OF BAGPIPES, IT'S DONALD TRUMP. I MEAN THAT'S -- IT JUST KIND OF FITS PERFECT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I WOULD -- NO. [ IMITATING BAGPIPES ] WHICH NOTE ARE WE STARTING ON? [ IMITATING BAGPIPES ] HEY MAN, YOU GOT A GOOD VIBE. YOU CAN PLAY. COME ON, MAN. [ IMITATING BAGPIPES ] ALL RIGHT, FORGET IT. A MIDDLE EASTERN RETAIL CHAIN CALLED LIFESTYLE ANNOUNCED THAT IT'S PULLING DONALD TRUMP'S HOME DECOR PRODUCTS FROM ITS SHELVES. BUT I GUESS THEY'LL STILL BE AVAILABLE AT THAT OTHER STORE, HATE AND BARREL. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN GET THEM THERE. OR AT HUGE WALL-MART. YOU GOTTA GO TO WALL. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN LEADING THE POLLS FOR MONTHS NOW, BUT MANY HAVE HAD A A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT EXACTLY WHO'S SUPPORTING HIM. WELL, CNN JUST RELEASED SOME INTERVIEWS WITH SELF-PROCLAIMED TRUMP SUPPORTERS THIS WEEK. SO LISTEN TO WHAT ONE OF THEM HAD TO SAY.
WHEN THE PUNDITS AND THE EXPERTS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE KNOW AND KNOW ALL THIS STUFF AND THEY'RE SO GREAT, I KNOW SOME OF THEM, MAYBE NOT ALL, BUT SOME OF THEM ARE LYING TO ME. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE THE PRINCE AND THE DRAGON. YOU KNOW, HERE'S TRUMP, YOU KNOW, WIELDING HIS SWORD AND YOU'VE GOT THIS HUGE FLIPPIN' MACHINE OF A DRAGON COMING AFTER HIM. WHO DO YOU THINK THE PEOPLE ARE GONNA GETTING BEHIND? I'M TELLING YOU, HE SAYS WHAT I'M THINKING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HO! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SURE. EVEN TRUMP WAS LIKE, "SECURITY." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HE'S LIKE, "COULD YOU HOLD THIS SWORD FOR ME?" [ APPLAUSE ] I SAW THAT HILLARY CLINTON TOLD "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE THAT HER GRANDDAUGHTER CALLED HER GRANDMA FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE SAME NIGHT AS THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC DEBATE. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] AND HILLARY GAZED INTO HER GRANDDAUGHTER'S EYES AND SAID, "THIS IS MY NIGHT, NOT YOURS. [ LAUGHTER ] PICK YOUR MOMENTS. PICK YOUR MOMENTS!" AND IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE, BERNIE SANDERS SAID THAT HIS GRANDCHILDREN SOMETIMES CALL HIM GRANDPA BERN. [ LAUGHTER ] SOUNDS LESS LIKE A TERM OF ENDEARMENT, MORE LIKE A MEDICAL CONDITION. [ LAUGHTER ] "YOU GOT GRANDPA BURN, THAT'S WHY IT HURTS WHEN YOU PEE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S VERY COMMON IN MEN YOUR AGE." SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS, THE SENATE VOTED IN A BILL THAT OVERHAULS MUCH OF THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT SO THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS LESS RESPONSIBILITY. SO INSTEAD OF BEING CALLED THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, IT'S NOW CALLED "DON'T BLAME US IF YOUR KID IS DUMB." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT. YEAH.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: A LITTLE INTERNATIONAL NEWS HERE. I HEARD THAT THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA JUST FIRED HIS FINANCE MINISTER, NLA-NLA -- SLAY-LAY, SLAY-LAY, SLAH-SLA. [ LAUGHTER ] EXCUSE ME. THEY JUST FIRED HIS FINANCE MINISTER SLAH-LAH. [ LAUGHTER ]

[ LAUGHTER ] AND IT WAS LIKE -- [ APPLAUSE ] APPARENTLY, MINISTER NAY-NAY WAS REPLACED BY MINISTERS WHIP AND STANKY LEG.

Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S YOUR DREAM.
IT'S MOSTLY MY KIDS, MOSTLY MY KIDS.
Jimmy: MOST OF YOUR KIDS ARE GOING, "YEAH." I'M SURE EVERYONE IS STRESSED ABOUT HOLIDAY SHOPPING RIGHT NOW, JIM. JIM, SINCE YOU'RE THE FATHER OF FIVE YOUNG CHILDREN, YOU AGREED TO PULL TOGETHER SOME GREAT TOY IDEAS FOR EVERYONE ON YOUR LIST. THESE ARE ALL 100% REAL TOYS.
THAT'S RIGHT, JIMMY. I SPENT THE LAST 36 MONTHS LOOKING AT TOYS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE ASKED --
I WENT TO, LIKE, EIGHT DIFFERENT CONTINENTS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHAT I FOUND ARE GREAT TOYS FOR DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS.
Jimmy: OKAY.
OBVIOUSLY, LIKE, WHAT A BABY IS GOING TO LIKE IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT A GRANDMA IS GOING TO LIKE.
Jimmy: OKAY, YEAH, YEAH.
SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS GO THROUGH THE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS, JIMMY, AND SHOW YOU WHAT'S GREAT.
Jimmy: WHAT SHOULD WE START WITH? BABIES?
WE'LL START WITH BABIES.
Jimmy: GREAT, LOVE IT.
BABIES ARE HARD TO SHOP FOR, JIMMY, BECAUSE THEY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT. THEY CAN'T EVEN SUPPORT THEIR HEADS. THEY'RE A MESS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SO THIS IS A GIFT FOR A BABY.
WHAT I DO KNOW ABOUT BABIES, THEY LOVE DRONES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU RESEARCHED FOR 36 MONTHS.
HEY, AUDIENCE, DO BABIES LOVE DRONES? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK BABIES -- I DON'T THINK BABIES LIKE DRONES.
THE ROOTS AGREE.
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK SO.
BABIES LOVE DRONES AND THANKFULLY IN THIS TECHNOLOGICALLY-ADVANCED COUNTRY WE LIVE IN, NOW THERE ARE DRONES FOR BABIES.
Jimmy: THIS IS EXCITING.
LETS TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE BABY DRONES. [ CROWD AWWS ]
Jimmy: OKAY.
REMOTE CONTROL. YOU'RE A BABY.
Jimmy: SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY FOR BABIES, BUT THESE ARE --
BUT BABY. A BABY WOULD GO, "GA-GA-GA-GA." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE.
AND THEN, SEE? AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE BABIES -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS ] ♪♪ PRETTY AMAZING.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I MEAN TELL ME A BABY'S NOT GOING TO LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THIS IS FRIGHTENING. FRIGHTENING. THAT'S NOT A GIFT FOR AN OLDER BABY.
A TODDLER.
Jimmy: I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE CALLED.
I HAVE TODDLERS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THE THING IS KIDS, THEY WANT PETS. THEY WANT A DOG. THEY WANT A CAT. THEY WANT A DOG. AND THE PROBLEM WITH PETS -- [ LAUGHTER ] THE PROBLEM WITH PETS IS THAT THEY'RE FILTHY.
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE.
THEY'RE FILTHY. THEY DON'T WEAR UNDERWEAR, SO YOU DON'T WANT A PET.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANT A PET.
THANKFULLY, WITH THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS IN OUR GREAT COUNTRY, THEY DEVELOPED THESE. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S NOT A REAL DOG, JIMMY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NOT A TINY --
THAT'S -- BUT, LISTEN. LISTEN. DO YOU HEAR THAT? I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MAKING ANY NOISE, BUT THERE'S THAT ONE AND THEN THERE'S THIS.
Jimmy: WAS IT BREATHING?
LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS NOT A REAL CAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT A REAL CAT?
THESE ARE LOW-ENERGY PETS. I LIKE TO CALL THEM "COMA PETS." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM NEEDING TO BE WALKED. AND WHEN THE BATTERY GOES OUT, YOU CAN JUST THROW THEM AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, THAT'S -- WHAT DO YOU TELL YOUR KIDS WHEN YOU GET --
TELL THE KIDS THE PET DIED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW ABOUT PRETEENS?
PRETEENS. THEY'RE A PRICKLY BUNCH, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I GUESS SO. I DIDN'T SAY THAT, DID I?
WHAT I KNOW ABOUT PRETEENS, THEY LOVE THE POPE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY LOVE THE POPE. YES. IF THERE'S TWO THINGS I KNOW ABOUT PRETEENS, THEY LOVE THE POPE, AND THEY LOVE WAVING. HERE WE GO. WE GOT A WAVING POPE. [ CHEERS ] A WAVING POPE. AND THIS IS SOLAR-OPERATED. LOOK, SEE? IT'S KIND OF MOVING. AND SEE? IT'S SOLAR, SO IT'S PRO-ENVIRONMENT.
Jimmy: LET ME SEE THIS THING.
AND THE POPE IS KIND OF WAVING. SEE, NOTICE THE POPE.
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC.
THAT'S ACTUALLY POPE FRANCIS.
Jimmy: IS HE WEARING A A WEDDING RING? IS HE MARRIED? [ LAUGHTER ] POPE'S MARRIED.
HE'S WAVING, HE'S NOT SAYING, "COME HERE." HE'S SAYING "GOOD-BYE. YOU'RE GOING TO HELL." [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. SO THAT'S --
Jimmy: PRETEENS WILL LOVE THAT.
HERE'S THE OTHER THING. JIMMY, YOU'RE A DAD. I'M A DAD. I'M A BETTER-LOOKING ONE. BUT HERE'S THE THING. IF YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO READ -- YOU WANT THEM TO READ.
Jimmy: YOU DO. EVERYONE WANTS THEIR KIDS TO READ.
HOW DO YOU GET A BOOK IN A A KID'S HAND? WHAT YOU DO IS YOU INTRODUCE THEM TO A REALLY HORRIBLE BOOK THAT MAKES ALL OTHER BOOKS LOOK GREAT.
Jimmy: GENIUS IDEA.
SO I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WOULD BE GREAT. [ CHEERS ] ♪♪
Jimmy: I WROTE THAT BOOK. THAT'S MY BOOK. I WROTE THAT. I WROTE IT.
NO THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN BY JIMMY FALLON.
Jimmy: THAT'S ME. JIMMY FALLON. THAT'S ME. I WROTE THIS ONE.
YEAH. YEAH. THAT'S WHY IT'S A GOOD BOOK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU SAID IT'S A GOOD BOOK.
DON'T YOU SPELL YOURS WITH A A HEART OVER THE "I-E" WITH A A HEART OVER THE "I"? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO. ONLY ON MY FAN SITE.
SO HERE'S THE OTHER THING. ANOTHER ISSUE PARENTS DEAL WITH IS THE SANTA CLAUS QUESTION. HEY, SPOILER ALERT. COVER THOSE KIDS' EARS. SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL THEIR KIDS SANTA'S DEAD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? NO ONE HAS THAT PROBLEM.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN TROUBLE. YOU DON'T WANT YOUR KIDS IN THERAPY SAYING, "MY DAD WAS GOOD-LOOKING, BUT HE SCARRED ME TELLING ME ABOUT SANTA BEING DEAD."
Jimmy: I WON'T EVER SAY THAT.
SO WHAT THESE SNOWMEN DO IS DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE. WATCH THIS. WATCH THIS. SANTA'S DEAD. SANTA'S A GONER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.
THEY'RE SICK. THEY'RE SICK.
Jimmy: I DON'T LIKE -- PLEASE.
SICK.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, JIM. YOU CAN THROW THEM -- WHAT IS THIS?
THIS IS A CALZONE. THEY'RE SO DELICIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT A TOY FOR A CHILD. THAT'S NOT A TOY AT ALL. NO, NO, PLEASE.
I LOVE CALZONES.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD.
THE ONE THING IS, WHAT TO GET THAT SPECIAL PERSON, SOMEONE IN YOUR LIFE, BRING BACK A LITTLE BIT OF THE ROMANCE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CHEW YOUR FOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
BRING BACK A LITTLE BIT --
Jimmy: THE ROMANCE.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. IS THERE ANYTHING --
Jimmy: WHAT?
A POTTERY WHEEL. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S NOTHING SEXIER THAN A A POTTERY WHEEL. BUT WHO HAS TIME TO CONVERT A A ROOM OR MOVE TO NEW MEXICO AND BUY ALL THAT BLUE JEWELRY? [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS A MINI CERAMIC POTTERY WHEEL.
Jimmy: THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE. NOW, TELL ME -- HERE, LET ME GET THIS.
OH, YEAH, YOU NEED A LITTLE WATER THERE? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. IS THAT VODKA?
NOW WATCH THIS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS ME RIGHT AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE SOUND IS SOOTHING -- THE SOUND IS SOOTHING ENOUGH.
