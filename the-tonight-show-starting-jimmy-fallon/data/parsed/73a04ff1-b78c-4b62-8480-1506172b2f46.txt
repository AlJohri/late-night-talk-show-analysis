THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. I CAN FEEL IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. YOU GUYS, WE HAVE JUSTIN BIEBER ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE ALSO HAVE AUTHOR, SALMAN RUSHDIE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY PLAN TO SPEND THE WHOLE SHOW GOOGLING WHO THE OTHER PERSON IS. IT'S VERY INTERESTING. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS, HERE. I SAW THAT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH CNN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY SAID THAT HE HAS NO PLANS TO ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP. WHEN ASKED IF HE'D HAVE A A CHANGE OF HEART, CHENEY WAS LIKE, "YES, EVERY WEEK." [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY DICK CHENEY SAID THAT HE WOULD SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP IF HE DOES IN FACT WIN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION, BUT NOT BEFOREHAND. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CHENEY'S LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE NOT TO PULL THE TRIGGER TOO EARLY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ GUNSHOT ]
Steve: MY FACE!
Jimmy: SORRY, MAN! [ APPLAUSE ] OH, AND THIS WEEK LINDSEY GRAHAM, I LOVE LINDSEY GRAHAM, HE QUALIFIED FOR THE NEXT REPUBLICAN DEBATE WHEN HE MANAGED TO GET AT LEAST 1% IN THREE DIFFERENT POLLS. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE MOST RELIEVED LINDSEY GRAHAM HAS BEEN SINCE EVERY TIME ONE OF HIS CATS COME HOME. HE'S LIKE -- [ LINDSEY GRAHAM IMPRESSION ] "GENERAL WHISKERS, WHERE WERE YOU ALL DAY?" [ LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, WISCONSIN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER SAYS THAT HE THINKS ONLY 12 STATES WILL DECIDE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND IF TRUMP WINS, THOSE 12 STATES WILL INCLUDE SHOCK, CONFUSION, OUTRAGE, DESPAIR, DENIAL, ANGER, BARGAINING AND FINALLY ACCEPTANCE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, PEOPLE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THE STATE DEPARTMENT RELEASING OVER 7,000 PAGES OF HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS THIS WEEK. YEAH, AND EVEN THOUGH 150 CENSORED MESSAGES SEEM TO BE REVEALING A LOT OF INFORMATION. SEE IF YOU CAN TELL. CHECK OUT SOME OF THE SUBJECT LINES. FIRST ONE IS, "SURE HOPE THESE E-MAILS NEVER COME BACK TO BLANK ME IN THE BLANK."
Steve: WHAT? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? CHECK OUT THIS OTHER ONE. IT SAYS, "REGARDING MAKING BLANK WINFREY MY RUNNING BLANK." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S BIG NEWS.
Steve: SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE BLANKING THE WRONG WORDS.
Jimmy: THEY'RE NOT, I MEAN, BUT I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THIS INFORMATION THAT'S SECRET -- TOP SECRET, THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FIND OUT.
Steve: RIGHT.
Jimmy: THEY'RE BLANKING IT OUT. FINALLY, LOOK AT THIS ONE. "HAD A GREAT DINNER WITH TU-BLANK SHAKUR LAST NIGHT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: I'M NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORIST, BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. WHAT'S REAL? WHAT'S NOT REAL? I DON'T KNOW.
Steve: WHAT'S REDACTED?
Jimmy: HEY, THIS IS PRETTY COOL. PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TAKING OVER THE WHITE HOUSE'S OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT THIS WEEK TO POST PICTURES OF HIS TRIP TO ALASKA. OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS NOW YOUR ANNOYING FRIEND ON VACATION. [ LAUGHTER ] [ BARACK OBAMA IMPRESSION ] "HERE I AM IN FRONT OF A A MUSEUM. UH -- HERE I AM AT THE BEACH. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET. UH -- HERE'S ME EATING A PEACH AT THE BEACH." [ LAUGHTER ] WHILE HE WAS IN ALASKA, PRESIDENT OBAMA STOPPED AT A A CAFE AND BOUGHT OUT ALL OF THEIR CINNAMON ROLLS FOR HIS STAFF. THE STAFF WAS LIKE, "THANKS, OBAMA." AND THE GUY BEHIND HIM IN LINE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, THANKS OBAMA." [ LAUGHTER ] GUESS I'LL GET THAT BEAR CLAW. "GENERAL WHISKERS, GET OUT OF HERE! I'M NOT TAKING YOU OUT ANYWHERE ANYMORE." [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, DONALD TRUMP WENT ON TWITTER THIS WEEK AND SAID THAT IF HE'S ELECTED, HE WOULD UNDO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RECENT DECISION TO CHANGE MT. McKINLEY'S OFFICIAL NAME BACK TO DENALI. NO, I GUESS INSTEAD TRUMP WOULD CALL IT TRUMP TOWER NORTH. [ LAUGHTER ] SOME TV NEWS, BILL WOLFF, THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF "THE VIEW" JUST ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS LEAVING THE SHOW AFTER ONLY A A YEAR. IT'S SHOCKING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THOUGH NOT QUITE AS SHOCKING AS FINDING OUT THAT SOMEONE WAS ACTUALLY IN CHARGE AT "THE VIEW." [ LAUGHTER ] "YOU LADIES STOP -- OH, FORGET IT. JUST GO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M GOING TO PLAY ANGRY BIRDS. GO FOR IT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH." CHECK THIS OUT. THERE ARE RUMORS THAT'S APPLE MAY START MAKING ORIGINAL CONTENT TO COMPETE WITH NETFLIX. YEAH.

Jimmy: I WAS LOOKING FOR A A THING TO TAKE OUT. YEAH.
"BUT THEN I SAW THIS LYRIC. YOU'VE GOT THE TITLE TRACK." AND I SAID, "I DIDN'T KNOW THAT NOVELS HAD A TITLE TRACK." HE SAID, "YEAH, YOU KNOW THE SONG." SO THEN HE WROTE THE SONG AND THEN THEY RECORDED IT.
Jimmy: COME ON. HOW COOL IS THAT?
CALLED "THE GROUND BENEATH HER FEET." AND THEN THEY DID IT ON TOUR. AND THEN MADE A VIDEO WITH ME AND THE BAND AND MILLA JOVOVICH. DIRECTED BY WIM WENDERS.
Jimmy: I MEAN, COME ON! THEY'RE ROCK STARS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I KNOW YOU HANG OUT -- YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY. YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH ROCK STARS. IS THIS TRUE THAT YOU DANCED WITH VAN MORRISON?
WELL THAT'S ALSO, IT'S ALSO BONO'S FAULT. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, I WAS IN DUBLIN AND HE SAID, HAD I EVER MET VAN MORRISON. AND I SAID NO. SO HE ARRANGED THIS LITTLE DINNER FOR ME TO MEET VAN. OF COURSE BONO'S LITTLE DINNER TURNS INTO, LIKE, 40 PEOPLE.
Jimmy: OH, HE DOESN'T HAVE A A LITTLE DINNER. NEVER, YEAH. EXACTLY, YEAH.
AND THEN AFTER DINNER THERE I JUST NOTICED THAT VAN WAS SITTING IN THE CORNER IN THIS LITTLE SIT UP CHAIR, LOOKING, HOW SHALL I PUT IT, LONELY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I WENT OVER TO HIM AND I SAID, "VAN, DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?" AND HE SAID, "ALL RIGHT THEN." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CAN I JUST ASK, HOW DO YOU DANCE WITH VAN MORRISON?
HE SIT UP BY THIS WITH HIS LITTLE HAT AND HE WENT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE HOPS UP AND DOWN?
I KIND OF POGOED WITH VAN MORRISON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S LEGENDARY. THAT'S SO AWESOME. OH, MY GOSH. [ APPLAUSE ] I LOVE THAT. OH, I LOVE THAT YOU ASKED HIM TO DANCE. SO YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK COMING OUT NEXT WEEK. CONGRATS AGAIN ON THIS. YOU'RE A FANTASTIC WRITER. I HAVE TO ASK, DO YOU HAVE ANY TRADITIONS FOR WHEN A BOOK COMES OUT? SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO. SUPERSTITIONS OR SOMETHING --
THERE'S A THING I DID, LIKE NOT LATELY, BUT WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT AND NOBODY KNEW WHO I WAS. I WOULD GO INTO BOOKSTORES AND I WOULD MOVE THE BOOK UP TO THE FRONT. [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD GO INTO A BOOKSTORE, THERE WOULD BE ONE COPY WITH THE SPINE OUT. I'D TAKE IT OFF THE SHELF AND I'D TAKE IT TO THE BEST SELLER TABLE AND PUT IT ON TOP OF THE NUMBER ONE BEST SELLER.
Jimmy: NO WAY. OF COURSE.
THEN BOOK SELLERS TELL ME NOW THAT EVERY WRITER DOES IT.
Jimmy: EVERY WRITER GOES INTO BARNES & NOBLE OR WHATEVER --
AND THEIR FAMILIES.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, YEAH.
SO THE BOOKSTORE SAYS, "OH, YEAH, THE WRITER'S FAMILY'S BEEN IN."
Jimmy: YEAH. AND NOW YOU WALK INTO A A BOOKSTORE AND YOU GO, "SALMAN, IT'S ALREADY THERE." YOU'VE DONE IT BUDDY. CONGRATULATIONS. TELL US WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT.
WITH THAT SAID, WHAT DO I MEAN, YOU SAID?
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YEAH. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS?
WELL, THE TITLE IS, IF YOU DO THE MATH, IS 1,001 NIGHTS. SO IT'S A KIND OF, THE IDEA IS --
Jimmy: ARABIAN NIGHTS.
SORT OF AN ARABIAN NIGHT STORY AND TRANSPORTED TO NEW YORK NOW. SO, IT'S GOT GENIES A BIT BUT --
Jimmy: SOLD. OH, YEAH I'M IN.
BUT THEY ATTACK MANHATTAN.
Jimmy: WHAT WERE YOU SAYING BACKSTAGE? WE NEED FICTION.
YEAH, BEFORE I WROTE THIS, I WROTE -- I WAS WRITING THIS MEMOIR FOREVER AND EVER. WHEN I FINISH THE MEMOIR, I SPENT THREE YEARS WRITING IT, I WAS REALLY -- I HAVE BEEN TRYING REALLY HARD TO TELL THE TRUTH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SICK OF THE TRUTH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I'M GOING TO TRY AND GO TO THE OTHER EXTREME, WAY OVER HERE FROM THE TRUTH, AND, YOU KNOW, MAKE [ BLEEP ] UP. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
