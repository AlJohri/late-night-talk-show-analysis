LUCKILY, A STRANGER BROKE IT UP WHO SAID, "GIRLS, GIRLS. STOP IT. I MEAN -- GENTLEMEN." [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER IN WASHINGTON. PRESIDENT OBAMA IS FACING REPEATED CALLS FOR HIS IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE OF THE IMMIGRATION CRISIS AT THE BORDER. BUT YESTERDAY, HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER SAID THAT IN FACT, "REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY HAVE NO PLANS TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT." WHICH GOT WEIRD WHEN OBAMA WAS LIKE, "DAMN." [ LAUGHTER ] "ALMOST GOT OUT OF THIS THING, YEAH. THAT WAS A GOOD WAY OUT, MAN. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO VACATION." [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. BOEHNER SAID REPUBLICANS HAVE NO PLANS TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT OBAMA. THEY WERE LIKE, "WE'RE TOO BUSY FIGURING OUT HOW TO IMPEACH HILLARY." YOU KNOW, WE GOTTA THINK AHEAD. GOTTA THINK AHEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, WE'LL -- YEAH, WE'LL GET HER. SOME MORE POLITCAL NEWS. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE GETTING READY TO LEAVE WASHINGTON D.C. ON FRIDAY FOR A FIVE WEEK RECESS. FIVE WEEKS? WHO GETS FIVE WEEKS OFF? [ LAUGHTER ]

Steve: TAKE A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YES.
Steve: YEAH, YEAH. A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS KIND OF A A CRAZY STORY. POLICE IN CHICAGO SAID THEY'RE LOOKING FOR TWO MEN IN THEIR LATE 50s WHO ROBBED A PHARMACY AND STOLE MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF VIAGRA. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S GOING TO BE WEIRD WHEN THEY CATCH THE GUYS AND SAY, "STICK 'EM UP! OH, THEY ARE." "THAT'S MORE THAN -- THAT'S OVER FOUR HOURS. YOU SHOULD CALL SOMEBODY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. TWO MEN IN THEIR LATE 50s STOLE OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF VIAGRA. POLICE DESCRIBE THEM AS SIX FEET TALL, AVERAGE BUILD AND REALLY HAPPY TO SEE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS WITH WEED BECOMING LEGAL EVERYWHERE, THIS IS A A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE HERE, BUT I SAW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HANDING OUT FREE MARIJUANA TO PEOPLE, THEN PUTTING THEM IN A DRIVING SIMULATOR TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF STONED DRIVING. THAT'S RIGHT. PEOPLE GOT HIGH AND PRETENDED TO DRIVE, OR, AS THAT'S MORE COMMONLY KNOWN, "MARIO KART." [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DRIFT.

Jimmy: IT'S NOT PART OF THE GAME.
Steve: I'M GETTING OLDER.
Jimmy: MAYBE YOU HEARD THAT, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST SAW THAT THIS WEEK IN NEW JERSEY, A WOMAN DRESSED LIKE A CLOWN WALKED AWAY WITH MINOR INJURIES AFTER SHE CRASHED HER CAR INTO A UTILITY POLE.

[ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. I SAW THAT CEREAL MAKER GENERAL MILLS SAYS IT'S MAKING EFFORTS TO CUT THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WHEN ASKED HOW, GENERAL MILLS WAS LIKE, "WE'RE GOING TO STOP MAKING FIBER ONE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT WOMEN HAVE BECOME SLIGHTLY SMARTER THAN MEN OVER THE LAST 100 YEARS.

I SAID TO THE BUS DRIVER -- I GO, "HEY, THE SUBWAY IS OFF, BUT IT SAID THIS COULD TAKE ME TO THE SUBWAY." AND THE BUS DRIVER SAID TO ME, AND I QUOTE -- HE GOES "I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SUBWAY." AND I WAS LIKE, "YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE -- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING?" LIKE, I'M A STAND-UP COMEDIAN, BUT I KNOW A FEW THINGS ABOUT SKETCH COMEDY. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE DIPPED MY TOE IN MIME. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SUBWAY?
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SUBWAY.
YOU'RE WEARING THE SAME OUTFIT AS THE MAN RUNNING THE SUBWAY! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE SUBWAY. IT'S, LIKE, COME ON. PLEASE, PEOPLE! PLEASE! IF SOMEBODY SAID TO ME, "YOU SEE THAT GUY WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH THE KHAKI SHORTS AND THE KINGS OF LEON T-SHIRT? YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT GUY?" I'D GO, "YEAH, I'LL TELL YOU A A FEW THINGS ABOUT THAT GUY."
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW A A COUPLE.
I KNOW THAT HE COULD USE SOMEBODY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S ABOUT ALL I KNOW. SO I GO -- I'M ON THE BUS. AND THEN THIS OTHER GUY ON THE BUS, COMPLETE STRANGER, ONLY OTHER GUY ON THE BUS -- HE GOES, "I'M TAKING THE SUBWAY. YOU CAN FOLLOW ME." AND SO NOW I'M IN AN ACTION FILM. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, "GOT IT!" YOU KNOW? AND I GO OVER, AND I'M SITTING DOWN. AND I'M FOLLOWING THIS GUY. AND I'M -- WHAT HAPPENED IS WE GO A COUPLE STOPS, AND THIS LADY WALKS ON THE BUS. AND SHE CHANGED EVERYTHING ON THE BUS BECAUSE SHE WAS A A PRETTY LADY. NO, NO, SHE WASN'T JUST BUS PRETTY. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE WAS PRETTY FOR THE WORLD, WHICH IS SHOCKING FOR US BUS GOERS. I DID THIS THING THAT I DO WHEN I SEE A PRETTY LADY, WHICH IS I LOOKED AT HER LONG ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT SHE'S PRETTY. AND THEN I LOOKED AT THE FLOOR. AND THEN I NEVER LOOKED UP AGAIN.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO.
YOU CAN USE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S MY MOVE. SO I'M LOOKING AT THE -- REALLY, I'M LOOKING AT THE FLOOR. AND GLANCING UP AT THIS GUY THAT I'M ABOUT TO FOLLOW BECAUSE HE'S, LIKE, MY RIDE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. HE'S JUST FULL ON STARING AT THE LADY. JUST, LIKE, GAWKING. AND I KNOW WE'RE ALL GUILTY OF STARING, QUEST. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S NOT -- I THINK THERE'S AN ETIQUETTE TO IT. I THINK THAT YOU CAN STARE AT SOMEONE USING YOUR PERIPHERAL VISION, LIKE YOU'RE INSIDE A A SPOOKY PAINTING ON "SCOOBY DOO." WHERE YOUR FACE DOESN'T MOVE -- [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEN YOUR EYES PAN FROM SIDE-TO-SIDE -- [ APPLAUSE ]  -- LIKE YOU LIVE INSIDE THE WALLS OF A MANSION. YOU'VE GOT IT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
NOW YOU'RE FEELING IT. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS GUY DID. HE'S JUST GAWKING AT THIS WOMAN, LIKE A -- LIKE A -- YOU KNOW, LIKE A JACKAL. AND IT MADE ME SO MAD. I JUST WANTED TO BE LIKE, "WE ALL WANT TO STARE AT THE LADY, BUT WE DON'T BECAUSE WE ARE DECENT PEOPLE." BUT THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DECENT PEOPLE AND CREEPY PEOPLE. CREEPY PEOPLE DO THE THINGS THAT DECENT PEOPLE WANT TO DO, BUT HAVE DECIDED ARE PROBABLY NOT A GREAT IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ] DECENT PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "I WOULD LIKE TO STARE AT THAT PRETTY LADY BUT IT WILL MAKE HER FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE." CREEPY PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "LOOK, I'VE GOT A THIN MUSTACHE, GLASSES FROM THE '70s -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND I KNOW MORE ABOUT THE BUS THAN THE BUS DRIVER. I'M GOING FOR IT!" SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. WE GO A COUPLE MORE STOPS. THE CREEPY GUY STANDS UP, LOOKS BACK AT ME AND GOES "LET'S GO." [ LAUGHTER ] OH, GREAT. NOW SHE THINKS I'M WITH YOU. I JUST BUILT UP A RAPPORT WITH THIS PRETTY LADY. WHERE WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT SHE IS PRETTY AND I AM DECENT. AND WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER, I LOOK AT THE FLOOR. AND NOW SHE THINKS I'M WITH YOU. I WOULD NEVER BE WITH YOU! AND AS I WALKED BY THE WOMAN I TRIED TO PROJECT ALL OF THIS WITH MY EYES. AND THAT WAS A LITTLE CREEPY.
Jimmy: IT WAS A LITTLE BIT. [ APPLAUSE ]
AND I KNEW IT, SO I SAID, "SORRY." WHICH WERE THE FIRST WORDS UTTERED IN A CONVERSATION WE WERE NOT HAVING. SO AS THIS WOMAN UNDERSTANDS HER BUS RIDE -- SHE BOARDED THE BUS. A CREEPY GUY STARED AT HER FOR TEN MINUTES. AND THEN ANOTHER GUY, WHO SHE DID NOT KNOW EXISTED, APPROACHED HER AND APOLOGIZED. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WEIRD BUS RIDE.
WHICH IN SOME WAYS -- WHICH MEANS WHAT I DID WAS WORSE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I WAS TELLING MY WIFE THIS STORY AT DINNER -- WHEN I GOT TO DINNER. THAT'S WHERE I WAS HEADED. AND SHE GOES "WAIT, IS THE MORAL OF THE STORY THAT YOU WANT CREDIT FOR NOT BEING CREEPY?"
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I SAID, "YEAH." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S EXACTLY --
YEAH. AND SHE SAID "YOU DO GET CREDIT. I MARRIED YOU." AND I SAID, "I WANT MORE THAN THAT." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S SO SMART. YOU SHOULD GET MORE THAN THAT. MORE WITH MIKE BIRBIGLIA WHEN WE GET BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HANGING OUT WITH MIKE BIRBIGLIA. DUDE, THAT WAS THE FUNNIEST STORY. THANK YOU FOR THAT.
OKAY. HOW GOOD ARE THE ROOTS? MY GOD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY GOD. I JUST SAW THEM WITH DAVE CHAPPELLE AT RADIO CITY.
Jimmy: HOW WAS --
BLEW MY MIND. YEAH.
Jimmy: WAS IT GREAT?
YEAH, AMAZING.
Jimmy: BUT YOU'VE GOT SOME BIG SHOWS. CHICAGO THEATER --
OH YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SEATTLE ON NEW YEAR'S.
Jimmy: BUT BAM IN BROOKLYN --
YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S A VERY EXCITING ONE.
Jimmy: SEPTEMBER 5th, THAT IS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY EXCITING BECAUSE I GET TO INVITE MY FRIENDS -- AND YOU'RE, OBVIOUSLY, INVITED. YOU GUYS ARE INVITED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I GET TO INVITE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, MY FAMILY, MY FRIENDS, MY DOCTORS, PEOPLE WHO KIND OF DON'T BELIEVE I'M A COMEDIAN.
Jimmy: YOUR DOCTOR DOESN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE --
NO, REALLY, THIS THING HAPPENED WHERE -- OVER CHRISTMAS, I HAD A -- IT'S HARD TO SAY ON THE 11:30 VERSION OF THE SHOW. I HAD A UROLOGICAL SYMPTOM. I HAD TO CALL MY UROLOGIST. I'LL DESCRIBE IT IN A VERY P.G. WAY. I HAD, LIKE, PINS AND NEEDLE SENSATION IN MY THING -- [ LAUGHTER ]  -- WHEN I WOULD MAKE LOVE TO MY WIFE. YEAH. SO IT'S NOT FUN.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, NO. NOT -- NO, YEAH, WOW, NO.
IT'S NOT FUN, RIGHT? SO I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, THIS IS TROUBLE." SO, I CALL MY UROLOGIST AND ASK FOR AN APPOINTMENT. BUT IT'S CHRISTMAS. HE'S ON VACATION. SO I E-MAIL HIM, AND I TOLD HIM MY SYMPTOMS. I WAS LIKE, "SHOULD I COME IN TO THE DOCTOR." I SAID, LIKE -- LET ME START BY SAYING THIS IS THE MOST GRAPHIC E-MAIL I'VE EVER WRITTEN. IT'S SO PERSONAL. AND THEN I TOLD HIM ALL OF THE SYMPTOMS IN DETAIL. AND THEN HE WROTE BACK, "SHOULD BE FINE. JUST COME BACK IN IN A FEW WEEKS." AND THEN HE CC'D A THIRD PARTY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO. NO!
WHO I DID NOT KNOW. JUST, LIKE, ANOTHER PERSON. AND I WAS LIKE, "YOU CAN'T DO THAT. LIKE, THAT'S SO NOT OKAY." AND SO I WENT IN IN A FEW WEEKS, AND HE LOOKED ME OVER. AND HE SAID "IT'S OKAY." HE LOOKED AT MY SYMPTOMS, AND HE GOES "IT'S OKAY." HE GOES YOU'RE JUST TRYING TOO HARD WHEN YOU HAVE SEX. AND I SAID, "YOU'RE TELLING ME." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A JOKE.
Jimmy: YEAH, I GET IT.
AND THEN I GO "HEY, BY THE WAY." I GO, "MAYBE WHEN YOU E-MAIL ME, MAYBE DON'T CC ANOTHER PERSON. BECAUSE I'M A COMEDIAN AND, LIKE, IT'S VERY PERSONAL. I DON'T REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO FORWARD THAT AROUND." AND HE GOES, "YOU'RE A A COMEDIAN?" AND I GO, "YEAH." AND A FEW MINUTES LATER, WE'RE CHECKING OUT -- OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED. THE PLACE WHERE THEY DON'T TAKE YOUR INSURANCE? [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE SAYS TO THE RECEPTIONIST, HE GOES, "THIS IS MIKE BIRBIGLIA. HE'S A COMEDIAN." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?! NO! NO AIR QUOTES!"
Jimmy: I AM AN ACTUAL COMEDIAN, AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME SEE ME!
SO I TOLD HIM TO WATCH TONIGHT. SO, HOPEFULLY HE'LL SEE THIS, AND HE'LL SEE ME AT BAM.
Jimmy: YEAH. HE'LL SEE YOU AT BAM. [ APPLAUSE ] MIKE BIRBIGLIA AT BAM IN BROOKLYN, SEPTEMBER 5th AND CHICAGO THEATER, SEPTEMBER 20th. FOR MORE INFO ON HIS TOUR GO TO BIRBIGS.COM. AND FOLLOW ON TWITTER @BIRBIGS. TEMPLE PERFORMS NEXT, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
