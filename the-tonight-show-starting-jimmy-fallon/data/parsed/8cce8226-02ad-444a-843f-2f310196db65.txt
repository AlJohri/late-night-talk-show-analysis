Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- MICHAEL DOUGLAS, KAT DENNINGS, MUSICAL GUEST, ST. VINCENT AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 240, MARYLAND!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY! OH, YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD! YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD! YOU'RE LOOKING GREAT. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. WELCOME TO NEW YORK CITY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. HERE WE ARE. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE IT'S THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE FOR 2016, WHICH CONTINUES TO HEAT UP. AND GET THIS, IN A RECENT INTERVIEW ROBERT DE NIRO ACTUALLY SAID THAT HE HOPED HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT. YEAH. HE GAVE HER A VERY STRONG ENDORSEMENT. HE WAS LIKE, "SHE'S PRETTY GOOD." [ LAUGHTER ] "PRETTY GOOD." THAT'S A LOT FOR ROBERT DE NIRO.
Steve: THAT'S A LOT.
Jimmy: YEAH. BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA STILL HAS A A COUPLE MORE YEARS LEFT. HE'S BEEN TRAVELING A LOT RECENTLY. IN FACT, I SAW THAT HE JUST MADE HIS FIRST PRESIDENTIAL TRIP TO THE STATE OF UTAH. YEAH. OBAMA SPENT HIS TIME IN UTAH JUST LIKE YOU'D EXPECT, BY TELLING PEOPLE, "UH, NO, I DON'T PLAY FOR THE JAZZ." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. HE WAS IN UTAH. OBAMA DISCUSSED IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH LEADERS OF THE MORMON CHURCH. OBAMA INTRODUCED THE FIRST LADY. THEN THE CHURCH'S PRESIDENT INTRODUCED HIS FIRST LADY. AND HIS SECOND LADY. AND HIS THIRD, FOURTH, AND FIFTH LADY. [ APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, I READ THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS NOW VISITED EVERY STATE IN THE U.S. EXCEPT FOR SOUTH DAKOTA. BUT HE'S VISITED AFGHANISTAN FOUR TIMES. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH EXPLAINS SOUTH DAKOTA'S NEW TOURISM SLOGAN -- "SOUTH DAKOTA: NOT AS FUN AS AFGHANISTAN." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S SAYING.
Steve: THAT'S NOT A GOOD SLOGAN.
Jimmy: DID YOU HEAR ABOUT JEB BUSH? DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS? THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING IF YOU'RE RUNNING OR MAYBE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THEY FIND THESE THINGS. JEB BUSH IS FACING CRITICISM AFTER IT WAS REVEALED THAT HE CHECKED OFF HIS RACE AS HISPANIC ON A VOTER REGISTRATION FORM BACK IN 2009. WHEN ASKED IF HE REGRETS IT NOW BUSH WAS LIKE, "SI." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT HISPANIC. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR JEB BUSH CLASSIFIED HIS RACE AS HISPANIC ON THE VOTER FORM. AND IF YOU THINK THAT LIE IS EMBARRASSING, CURRENT FLORIDA GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT CLASSIFIED HIS RACE AS HUMANOID. AND YOU KNOW THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
Steve: HUMANOID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BIG UPSET IN MARCH MADNESS OVER THE WEEKEND. DID YOU SEE THAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ON SATURDAY THE WISCONSIN BADGERS BEAT THE UNDEFEATED KENTUCKY WILDCATS TO PLAY IN TONIGHT'S NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHEN ASKED HOW THEY FELT ABOUT THE LOSS, KENTUCKY'S PLAYERS WERE ALREADY IN THE NBA. SO THEY COULD CARE LESS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DON'T CARE. THAT'S RIGHT. THE NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WAS TONIGHT BETWEEN THE WISCONSIN BADGERS AND THE DUKE BLUE DEVILS. NOW, OUR SHOW TAPES BEFORE THE GAME, SO I DON'T KNOW WHICH TEAM WON OR LOST. SO RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE TO TAKE A A MOMENT TO OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS AND CONDOLENCES TO BOTH TEAMS. [ LAUGHTER ] CONGRATULATIONS, DUKE! YOU WON THE GAME! I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT. YOU PLAYED YOUR HEARTS OUT. BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T WIN THEM ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] LOSING HURTS. THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT YEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] UNLESS YOU'RE WISCONSIN. BECAUSE YOU GUYS WON TONIGHT! YOU SHOT THE BALL WELL, PLAYED AMAZING DEFENSE, AND SOMEHOW -- IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAME UP SHORT AND YOU LOST. YOU LOST BIG-TIME. BUT THAT'S OKAY. BECAUSE YOU WON! [ CHEERS ] BUT YOU LOST. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH MEANS DUKE WON! EITHER WAY I JUST WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WIS-DUKE-SIN DADGE BEVILS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SPEAKING OF SPORTS, TODAY WAS OPENING DAY FOR MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, THAT'S EXCITING. I LOVE OPENING DAY. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE RETIRED LEGENDS COME BACK TO TAKE THE CEREMONIAL URINE TEST. OH, IT'S SO FUN. [ LAUGHTER ] SO FUN. OF COURSE, TAX DAY IS COMING UP. BUT ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT, THE IRS IS IGNORING OVER 60% OF ITS CUSTOMER SERVICE CALLS LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE DEADLINE. SO I THINK WE SHOULD ALL SKIP PAYING OUR TAXES, JUST SO WHEN THE IRS CALLS US WE CAN GO, "OH, YOUR CALL IS IMPORTANT TO US. PLEASE STAY ON THE LINE." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] A REPRESENTATIVE -- YOUR CALL IS IMPORTANT TO US. PLEASE STAY ON THE LINE. AND FINALLY, THIS IS COOL. I READ THAT ABC IS WORKING ON BRINGING BACK "THE MUPPET SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHEN ASKED WHY HE'S COMING BACK, KERMIT SAID, "DIVORCE IS A REAL BITCH." [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW! GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS, EVERYBODY! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Jimmy: IN THE DOWN TIME. YEAH, I GUESS I DO THAT.

Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT IT? ANYTHING -- [ LAUGHTER ] NERVOUS?
I WAS SO -- I'LL TELL YOU QUITE HONESTLY, I WAS THINKING THE NIGHT WHEN THEY CALLED, IT WAS "FOUR MINUTES, TWO MINUTES." AND YOU SAY, "WELL, LET ME JUST MAKE A FAST PIT STOP." AND 44 YEARS AGO THE FIRST TIME I WAS SO TERRIFIED. SO, I GO FOR A LITTLE FAST PIT STOP RIGHT BEFORE I GO ON. I COME ON OUT, AND THE PEOPLE THEY GO, "MR. DOUGLAS, YOU GOT A LITTLE MESS THERE." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO.
I GOT MY HAIR DRYER. [ LAUGHTER ] THE HAIR DRYER. WORKED ME OVER REALLY FAST. AND THEN, "HERE'S JOHNNY!" I CAME OUT. AND I WAS TERRIFIED. JUST FROZEN. AND JOHNNY COULD TELL.

YEAH!
Jimmy: YES, SEE, YOU'VE GOT ONE GLUTEN-FREE. SHE'S GOT LOTS OF ENERGY. ALL THAT NON-GLUTEN ENERGY YOU LOST. "YEAH!" YOU GET ALMOST LIKE AN ENERGY TOURETTE'S FROM THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU JUST START YELLING THINGS OUT. A LOT OF KIDS IN OUR -- PEOPLE IN OUR OFFICE ARE DOING THE GLUTEN -- LIKE THE PALEO THING. BUT THEY SAY THEY GET A LITTLE GRUMPY. ARE YOU GETTING GRUMPY?
THEY'RE TAKING THE WRONG KIND --
Jimmy: YEAH, A DIFFERENT --
NO, THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT. I FEEL GOOD. THINGS ARE GOING GOOD.
Jimmy: ARE YOU HAVING A BIG BIRTHDAY PARTY?
CATHERINE AND I HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH, WE'RE A COUPLE YEARS APART. [ LAUGHTER ] 70 IS THE NEW 50. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU THINK SO?
MAYBE 55. YOU KNOW. CATHERINE AND I, MY WIFE FOR 25 YEARS, WHEN WE FIRST GOT TOGETHER, THE DIFFERENCE -- WHEN WE FIRST GOT TOGETHER, CATHERINE WAS 29. AND I WAS 54. AND WE WERE GOING TO HAVE -- LET'S HAVE OUR SAME BIRTHDAY PARTY TOGETHER. I SAID, "NO, WE'RE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL YOU TURN 30." BECAUSE 30 AND 55 SOUNDS BETTER. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S ONLY TWO DECADE NUMBERS IN THERE RATHER THAN THE THREE. NO, THIS ONE I WAS ON THE MOVIE "ANT-MAN" ON LOCATION, SO WE'RE GONNA SAVE -- WE'LL WAIT FOR THE 75 AND 50.
Jimmy: I'M EXCITED ABOUT "ANT-MAN," BY THE WAY. THIS IS YOU AND PAUL RUDD. THIS IS A BIG MARVEL SUPERHERO MOVIE. OH, THIS IS GOING TO BE GIANT. ARE YOU EXCITED TO BE IN ONE OF THESE THINGS?
I AM. BUT I'M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, I KNOW, OF COURSE NOT. WHY WOULD WE? ABSOLUTELY. BUT YOUR KIDS MUST BE EXCITED.
MY KIDS. IT'S LIKE I NEVER DID A MOVIE BEFORE. MOST OF MY MOVIES ARE R-RATED.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T WATCH WHAT DAD DID, YEAH.
UP UNTIL ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT CATHERINE WAS THE ACTRESS AND DADDY MADE PANCAKES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT YOU'RE BOTH ACTING. YEAH. YOUR FIRST ACADEMY AWARD YOU THAT WON WAS FOR PRODUCING "ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST."
RIGHT.
Jimmy: WHICH IS AMAZING, OBVIOUSLY. [ APPLAUSE ]
AND THAT'S HAVING A 40TH ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR. 40 YEARS. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT THE TRICKY THING -- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE, WAS THAT YOUR DAD WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE LEAD. WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE JACK NICHOLSON ROLE.
THAT'S WHAT HE THOUGHT, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT YOU'RE THE PRODUCER.
BUT WHEN DID THE DIRECTOR STOP CASTING MOVIES? WHEN DID THE PRODUCER -- YOU KNOW, MY FATHER WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT FOR A A LONG TIME AND TRIED TO GET IT MADE AND THEN WAS GOING TO SELL IT AND PASS IT ON. I SAID, "LET ME TRY TO RUN WITH THIS AND GET IT GOING." AND I DID GET IT GOING, BUT BY THAT TIME A FEW YEARS HAD PASSED AND SO JACK NICHOLSON LOOKED MORE RIGHT. AND IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT MY FATHER HAS NEVER FORGIVEN ME. [ LAUGHTER ] NEVER.
Jimmy: DOES HE BRING IT UP?
EVERY TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER. WE JUST HAD THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY, YOU KNOW. CAN YOU IMAGINE? EVERY TIME. "SURE. HE GOT THE PART." [ LAUGHTER ] I UNDERSTAND. HE'S VERY SOLEMN. HE HAD A GOOD PART. THANK GOODNESS THE PICTURE TURNED OUT VERY WELL. I DO REMIND HIM BECAUSE I SHARED MY PRODUCING PROFITS WITH HIM. AND HE DID MAKE MORE MONEY ON THAT PICTURE THAN ANY MOVIE HE'S EVER DONE.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO, DAD.
IT'S OKAY.
Jimmy: BUT YOU TOOK KIND OF A NOTE FROM YOUR DAD HERE. OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE A GREAT ACTOR. BUT YOU'RE PLAYING A VILLAIN IN "BEYOND THE REACH."
RIGHT. IT'S TRUE. HE DID ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT PICTURES BEFORE HE DID "THE CHAMPION," WHICH HE GOT NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR. HE PLAYED A BAD GUY IN THAT PICTURE.
Jimmy: HE WAS ALWAYS THE NICE GUY.
HE WAS A NICE GUY. I LOVE PLAYING A VILLAIN.
Jimmy: YOU'RE GOOD AT THEM.
BAD TO THE BONE, MAN. BAD TO THE BONE. GOOD TO BE BAD.
Jimmy: WHICH IS GOOD, BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKEABLE, THOUGH. AND I LIKE YOU AND I GO --
THAT'S WHAT I TRY TO DO. IT'S SO MUCH FUN BECAUSE THERE'S NO RESTRICTIONS. THAT'S WHY MOST ACTORS HAVE HAD THEIR BEST SUCCESSES PLAYING VILLAINS. SO "BEYOND THE REACH" WAS A A GREAT CHANCE FOR -- TO BE BAD.
Jimmy: WELL, IT'S A GOOD CLASSIC THRILLER THAT YOU WANT FROM MICHAEL DOUGLAS. AND IN THIS ONE -- DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE --
THIS IS A -- I'M A SUCCESSFUL WEST COAST BONDS TRADESMAN WHO'S A TROPHY HUNTER OUT LOOKING FOR BIGHORN SHEEP, AND RUN INTO SOME TROUBLE WITH MY YOUNG GUIDE PLAYED BY JEREMY IRVINE. WE MADE A DEAL.
Jimmy: HE WAS IN "WAR HORSE."
HE WAS IN "WAR HORSE." RIGHT. AND WE MADE A DEAL. HE RENEGED ON IT. AND I'M NOT HAPPY.
Jimmy: THIS IS A GUY TRYING TO KILL BIGHORN SHEEP. YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH THIS GUY. WE HAVE A CLIP OF MICHAEL DOUGLAS IN "BEYOND THE REACH." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

Jimmy: MICHAEL DOUGLAS DID THE "MACARENA" AND JON CRYER HAD TO HAVE SOMEONE GUESS "PRETTY IN PINK." [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT WAS VERY SAD.
Jimmy: WE DID NOT PLAN THAT AT ALL. THAT'S JUST CRAZY.
THAT WAS VERY SAD.
Jimmy: THAT WAS SO GOOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HE HAD TO DO THAT. OH, MY GOD.
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: AND THEN "OF MICE AND MEN."
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU PULLED THAT OUT. SORRY, I'M JUST OBSESSED WITH WINNING, I KNOW.
MICHAEL DOUGLAS DID GIVE IT AWAY A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: HE DID.
BECAUSE YOU SAID BOOK AND HE SAID PLAY. AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT COULD THAT BE?"
Jimmy: OH. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN HE SAID FOUR WORDS AND WAS THERE. I WAS THERE.
Jimmy: WHAT? THAT'S WHAT -- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED AT ALL.
IT'S A BOOK AND A PLAY.
Jimmy: BUT THERE'S A LOT OF BOOKS AND PLAYS.
BUT WHAT IS SEMI-MAINSTREAM ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO GUESS WITH YOU?
Jimmy: "OF MICE AND MEN" WOULD BE THE FIRST GUESS? [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, SORT OF.
Jimmy: I MEAN, I GUESS SO. I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

MUCH TO YOUR ALARM, LET'S ASSUME YOUR KID GOT INTO YOUR STASH OF STEVE MARTIN RECORDS YOU HAD HIDDEN AND WHEN I WAS ABOUT FOUR I FOUND MY MOM'S STAND-UP RECORDS AND I MEMORIZED THEM AND I WENT UPSTAIRS AND I RECITED THEM WORD FOR WORD IN HIS VOICE, LIKE THIS.

TWO WILD AND CRAZY GUYS.
Jimmy: WENT TO GO TO THE STATUE OF LIBERTY TO GET BIRTH CONTROL DEVICES AND MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD BE LIKE, "WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?" [ LAUGHTER ] L
NO, I KNOW.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
IT WAS VERY SHOCKING. I ALSO LOVED "MONTY PYTHON" BECAUSE I HAVE AN OLDER BROTHER AND HE GAVE ME ALL THE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I MEAN THESE ARE GREAT.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THESE ARE GREAT RECORDS TO HAVE.

I KNOW. I WAS SO INTO IT.
Jimmy: BUT YOU WOULD REHEARSE IN YOU ROOM. DID YOUR MOM EVER CATCH YOU? LIKE, GO LIKE, HEY, "DINNER'S -- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?" [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, YES. I DON'T KNOW, I'M GLAD I DIDN'T END UP IN SOME SORT OF CHILD INSTITUTION BECAUSE THEY SAW ME DOING A LOT OF WEIRD STUFF. [ LAUGHTER ] ONE DAY MY ME CAME IN MY ROOM AND I WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR AND I WAS FOUR. AND I DIDN'T HAVE A SHIRT ON. I JUST HAD A LITTLE SKIRT ON. AND I HAD A PHONE THAT WAS PLUGGED INTO MY BELLY BUTTON. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: YEAH. I ALMOST THINK THAT SHOULD BE LIKE A ONE-WOMAN SHOW NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YEAH.
IT'S TERRIBLE.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S CUTE WHEN YOU'RE FOUR YEARS OLD.
IS IT.
Jimmy: WELL, IT'S ALSO A A "TWILIGHT ZONE" EPISODE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S BOTH.
Jimmy: NOW, YOU HAVE TIME OFF NOW, RIGHT?
YES. WE JUST FINISHED THE FINALE AND I'M ON HIATUS AND I'M VERY HAPPY.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU DO WITH TIME OFF? DO YOU TRAVEL? DO YOU DO ANYTHING WEIRD? ANYTHING FUN?
YEAH. WELL, I CAME TO NEW YORK TO DO THIS, THRILLED. AND I DON'T KNOW. I MOSTLY JUST LOOK AT THE INTERNET. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU JUST LOOK ON THE INTERNET. AND WHAT DO YOU FIND ON THERE, ANYTHING?
LOOK AT THE INTERNET, GO ON THE NETFLIX AND PINTEREST. AND I GET A BAD, BAD IDEA FROM PINTEREST THAT I DID TO MYSELF.
Jimmy: WHAT IS THAT?
WELL --
Jimmy: CAN YOU SAY? [ LAUGHTER ]
YES. WELL, I, YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO LOOK THE SAME FOR THE SHOW ALL THE TIME. CAN'T REALLY CUT MY HAIR, CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO MYSELF. AND I WAS LOOKING AT D.I.Y. HAIR DYEING. LIKE THINGS YOU CAN DYE YOUR HAIR WITH. THINGS YOU HAVE IN THE KITCHEN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND IT SAID YOU COULD DYE YOUR HAIR WITH COFFEE. BUT I HAVE BROWN HAIR ALREADY. IT'S A LITTLE -- KIND OF DUMB. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. THAT'S TRUE. YEAH.
I WAS LIKE, "I WANT TO DO IT. I WANT TO DO IT." SO I PUT A BUNCH OF LIKE INSTANT POWDERED COFFEE LIKE STARBUCKS IN THE THING, PUT IT WITH SOME CONDITIONER. I PUT LIKE TEN INSTANT COFFEES, AND I PUT IT ALL OVER MY HEAD. AND I FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO DIE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY -- WAIT, DID IT GO RIGHT THROUGH YOUR SCALP?
RIGHT THROUGH MY PORES! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A CAFFEINE JOLT.
