YES, JIMMY!
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BUDDY. YOU GUYS, WE HAVE ASHTON KUTCHER ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND HOPEFULLY HE'S HERE TO TELL US THIS WHOLE ELECTION HAS JUST BEEN ONE GIANT PRANK. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. OF COURSE, LAST NIGHT WAS THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, WHICH WAS A PRETTY BIG DEAL, BECAUSE FOR 90 MINUTES, DONALD TRUMP WASN'T ON TV. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A BIG DEAL. I NOTICED THAT SEVERAL TIMES TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE, MIKE PENCE, SPOKE DIRECTLY INTO THE CAMERA TO ADDRESS VIEWERS AT HOME. PENCE SAID IT WAS JUST PART OF HIS PLAN TO REALLY FREAK OUT STONERS. [ LAUGHTER ] DUDE, HIDE YOUR WEED. HE CAN SEE US. THAT'S YOUR VOICE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] STONERS DON'T TALK LIKE THAT ANYMORE.
Steve: WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YEAH, THEY DO.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S LIKE AN OLD THING.
Steve: NO, MAN. YOU'RE WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS GUY, HE'S IN MY HEAD!
Jimmy: AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DEBATE, I SAW THAT MIKE PENCE ACCIDENTALLY CALLED LONGWOOD UNIVERSITY NORWOOD UNIVERSITY. I GUESS PENCE WAS SO CONSERVATIVE HE CAN'T EVEN SAY THE WORD "LONGWOOD." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DON'T MAKE ME SAY IT. DON'T MAKE ME SAY IT.
Steve: HO!
Jimmy: YEAH, I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
Steve: HEY!
Jimmy: BUT PEOPLE ARE SAYING HILLARY'S RUNNING MATE, TIM KAINE, DIDN'T COME OFF TOO WELL, BECAUSE HE INTERRUPTED MIKE PENCE 72 TIMES. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] IN FACT KAINE INTERRUPTED SO MUCH THE MODERATOR ACCIDENTLY CALLED HIM MR. TRUMP. AND HE GOES -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "MR. TRUMP" -- "WRONG. NOT. NEVER HAPPENED. LONGWOOD. I HAVE NO PROBLEM IN THE LONGWOOD DEPARTMENT. I CAN GUARANTEE IT. I CAN SAY THAT MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HAVE NO PROBLEM." BUT THE LINE OF THE NIGHT WAS PROBABLY UNINTENTIONAL, AND IT CAME FROM MIKE PENCE AFTER ONE OF TIM KAINE'S ACCUSATIONS. HERE, LISTEN TO THIS.
WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS WOMEN SHOULD BE PUNISHED OR MEXICANS ARE RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS --
I'M TELLING YOU --
OR JOHN McCAIN'S NOT A HERO, HE IS SHOWING YOU WHO HE IS.

"NO, GO BACK TO THE OTHER 'BLACK GIRL.'"
Jimmy: BUT, YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT. THAT WAS SOME FANTASTIC, YOU DID A LOT OF THINGS, BUT, I LOVE THAT. IT IS HUGE, HITS TOO CLOSE TO HOME, YEAH. I WANT YOU TO EVER BE NOT AWKWARD, THOUGH.
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] I'LL ALWAYS BE THAT.
Jimmy: YOU'LL ALWAYS BE THAT, YEAH.
YES, I CAN'T, LIKE, I STILL, I SAW YOU IN THE HALLWAY EARLIER, AND IT WAS GREAT. BUT I WAS, I KEPT THINKING OF COMING BACK FROM THE HALLWAY AND SEEING YOU AGAIN. AND WHEN WE HAVE TO, LIKE, WHEN I HAVE ACKNOWLEDGE YOU, OR WOULD YOU ACKNOWLEDGE ME, STILL? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OF COURSE, I WOULD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YEAH, I WOULD.
THAT'S THE THINGS I THINK ABOUT.
Jimmy: WOULD WE ACKNOWLEDGE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
BECAUSE I JUST SAW YOU, AND WE ALREADY SAID HI. SO, LIKE, WOULD I SAY, WOULD I BE LIKE, "OH, HEY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU WOULDN'T SAY, "OH, HI," AGAIN, BUT WE'D MAKE OTHER CONVERSATION.
YOU DO THAT WEIRD SIDE HI, LIKE, THAT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WOULDN'T DO THAT. I WOULDN'T HAVE MY PHONE. NOW, I WOULD SAY, "HOW ARE YOU? YOU LOOK GREAT." I WOULD TALK ABOUT ANYTHING. I MEAN, LET'S ABOUT THIS BIG PREMIERE. I MEAN, THIS IS, THIS IS LIFE CHANGING.
IT IS.
Jimmy: IT'S IN HBO. IT'S A GIANT.
I KNOW.
Jimmy: I MEAN, YOUTUBE IS BIG. THIS IS HBO.
I KNOW. I'M MAD EXCITED, AND IT JUST FEELS LIKE -- BUT IT KIND OF STILL FEELS THE INTERNET TO A DEGREE, LIKE, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: NOW, BECAUSE THE SHOW HASN'T AIRED YET.
YOU'RE RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT WAIT TILL IT AIRS ON TELEVISION. IT'S GAME CHANGING.
I KNOW. I'M ANXIOUS FOR IT TO JUST BE OUT THERE, SO THAT I --
Jimmy: I THINK YOU REALLY ARE PERFECTLY, YOU ARE YOU. YOU ARE EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED YOU TO BE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU ARE YOU. YOU ARE FANTASTIC. LOOK, I'M NOT THE ONLY, I'M PROUD OF YOU. YOUR DAD IS PROUD OF YOU.
MY DAD, MY DAD DIDN'T KNOW.
Jimmy: LOOK AT THAT. COME ON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S PROUD OF YOU.
HE'S PROUD OF ME. BUT, LIKE, HE'S BEEN HINTING ABOUT GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL FOR THE LONGEST. LIKE, I REMEMBER I, WE WERE IN, LIKE, A FAMILY GROUP CHAT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND, I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE SHOW AND HOW EXCITED I WAS, AND EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY IS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD! THAT'S CRAZY! GREAT JOB!" AND HE COMES, LIKE, "SO, GRAD SCHOOL, IS THAT STILL AN OPTION?" YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] HE STILL WANTS ME TO GET AN EDUCATION, BUT SEEING THE BILLBOARDS, LIKE, REALLY SOLIDIFIED IT FOR HIM.
Jimmy: YEAH.
LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING TO BRAG ABOUT.
Jimmy: YOU GOT TO BE. COME ON. THAT'S AWESOME. THAT'S FANTASTIC. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE SHOW IS BASICALLY YOU BEING YOU, BUT LIVING YOUR LIFE IN L.A., AND IT'S JUST YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.
YES.
Jimmy: THERE'S A LOT OF AWKWARD SCENES. SOME PEOPLE ARE COMPARING IT TO "CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM" BECAUSE YOU DO KIND OF HAVE THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE, LIKE IN THE HALLWAY.
YEAH, IN THE HALLWAY. I MEAN, IT REALLY JUST FOLLOWS TWO BEST GIRLFRIENDS NAVIGATING DATING IN L.A., YOU KNOW, THEIR JOBS IN L.A., AND KIND OF EACH OTHER, AND IT REALLY JUST, IT HIGHLIGHTS A LOT OF THESE MUNDANE SITUATIONS THAT, YOU KNOW, LARRY DAVID, HE WAS JUST GREAT ABOUT, LIKE, MAKING SMALL MOMENTS BIG.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. BUT, I MEAN, THERE'S ONE. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE CLIP WE'RE GOING TO SHOW, BUT I SAW WHERE YOU -- YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO SHAKE SOMEONE'S HAND OR HUG THEM.
UH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND IT'S REALLY AWKWARD, AND, YEAH, IT'S REALLY FUNNY, AND GOSH, IT JUST MADE ME LAUGH. IT'S WELL-WRITTEN, BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: YOU GOT GOOD STUFF. WE HAVE A CLIP HERE, ISSA RAE IN "INSECURE." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
SINCE, YOU GUYS ARE SO INTERESTED IN MY PERSONAL LIFE, HERE IT IS.
I'M 28, ACTUALLY 29, BECAUSE TODAY'S MY BIRTHDAY. I CAME FROM A GREAT FAMILY. I HAVE A COLLEGIATE DEGREE. I WORK IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD BECAUSE I LIKE TO GIVE BACK. I'VE BEEN WITH MY BOYFRIEND FOR FIVE YEARS, AND I DID THIS TO MY HAIR ON PURPOSE. SO, I HOPE THAT COVERS EVERYTHING. DOES ANYBODY ACTUALLY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT? WE GOT YOU ALL?
WHY AIN'T YOU MARRIED?
I'M JUST NOT, RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
MY DAD SAID, "AIN'T NOBODY CHECKING FOR BITTER ASS BLACK WOMEN ANYMORE." [ LAUGHTER ]
DAYNEICE, THAT'S DETENTION. APOLOGIZE NOW.
SORRY.
THAT'S OKAY, AND TELL YOUR DAD BLACK WOMEN AREN'T BITTER. WE'RE JUST TIRED OF BEING EXPECTED TO SETTLE FOR LESS.
YOUR OUTFIT SETTLED FOR LESS! [ LAUGHTER ] GOT HIM! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
KIDS ARE SO MEAN.
