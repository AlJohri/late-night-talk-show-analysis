Questlove: FIVE -- WOO!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT RIGHT THERE. HELLO! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST JIMMY FALLON. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, EVERYBODY. I APPRECIATE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELL, HERE'S THE LATEST ON THE ELECTION. THREE MORE STATES WENT TO THE POLLS YESTERDAY, AND A LOT OF PLACES WOUND UP HAVING A RECORD TURNOUT. I GUESS PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEIR GRANDKIDS, "THERE USED TO BE A COUNTRY CALLED AMERICA. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I VOTED IN THE LAST ELECTION." [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, THREE STATES HELD PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES ATES HELD YESTERDAY IN WHAT WAS BEING CALLED WESTERN TUESDAY. YOU CAN TELL IT WAS WESTERN TUESDAY BECAUSE THERE WAS EVEN  SOME TUMBLEWEED ON THE BALLOT. AND IT WAS VERY -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "IT'S WINDY." I READ THAT UTAH REGISTERED ALMOST 60,000 PEOPLE TO VOTE IN THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS ONLINE. YOU KNOW, THE CANDIDATES AREN'T VERY POPULAR WHEN PEOPLE ONLY VOTE IF THEY CAN DO IT IN THEIR UNDERWEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] "I LIKE CRUZ, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO PUT PANTS ON. THAT AIN'T WORTH IT." MEANWHILE DONALD TRUMP SAID YESTERDAY THAT A LOT OF POLITICIANS WHO SAY THEY ARE AGAINST HIM IN PUBLIC ARE SECRETLY SUPPORTING HIS CAMPAIGN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] OR AS HILLARY CLINTON PUT IT, "GUILTY." [ LAUGHTER ] "YOU GOT ME. YOU GOT ME. THAT'S -- THAT'S TRUE." [ APPLAUSE ] AND DID YOU SEE THIS? AN EDITOR FOR "THE WASHINGTON POST" SAYS THAT DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY HIT ON HER AFTER SHE ASKED HIM A QUESTION. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] TO BE FAIR, THE QUESTION WAS, "WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER TORTURE?" [ LAUGHTER ] "WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ON A DATE WITH ME?" OH, CHECK THIS OUT, THOUGH. THERE'S A WEBSITE CALLED VOTETRUMPGETDUMPED.COM. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ASKING WOMEN NOT TO SLEEP WITH TRUMP SUPPORTERS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OR AS MELANIA PUT IT, "WHAT IS NAME OF SITE AGAIN? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'LL GET REGISTERED." THAT'S NOT RUSSIAN.
Steve: VERY RUSSIAN, APPARENTLY.
Jimmy: IN SOME RECENT RENTLY. INTERVIEWS HILLARY CLINTON'S OLDER SUPPORTERS SAID THEY WERE DRAWN TO HER BECAUSE OF HER EXPERIENCE AND FOREIGN POLICY BACKGROUND. WHILE BERNIE SANDERS' OLDEST SUPPORTERS ARE DRAWN TO HIM BECAUSE HE MAKES THEM FEEL YOUNG. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I GUESS BERNIE DIDN'T REALLY MIND BECAUSE HER OUTFIT WAS MISSING THE TOP 1%. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S KIND OF WHAT HE'S SAYING. THIS IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL. I SAW THAT SARAH PALIN JUST SIGNED A DEAL TO ACT AS A JUDGE ON A NEW REALITY COURT TV SHOW. SARAH SAID SHE JUST WANTS TO GET A LITTLE LEGAL EXPERIENCE BEFORE TRUMP NOMINATES HER TO THE SUPREME COURT. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S GONNA DO DAYTIME --
Steve: YEAH. YOU GOTTA GO.
Jimmy: AND A LITTLE LOCAL NEWS HERE, A BILL WAS INTRODUCED LAST WEEK OVER IN NEW JERSEY THAT WOULD OUTLAW TEXTING WHILE WALKING.

IT'S PRETTY -- OH, AND CHIPOTLE IS STILL TRYING TO BRING BACK CUSTOMERS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND NOW THEY'VE EVEN LAUNCHED AN ONLINE GAME WHERE YOU COMPETE FOR FREE FOOD CALLED GUAC HUNTER.

Jimmy: NO, YOU -- NO, YOU HAVE TO LOG OUT, ACTUALLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: TOUCHE.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THERE ARE NO WINNERS. FINALLY, I THOUGHT THIS WAS PRETTY FUNNY. A TOWN IN OREGON HAS BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH TOO MANY SEA LIONS THAT LIKE TO HANG OUT ON ITS DOCKS. AND I THINK THEY CAME UP WITH A A PRETTY GOOD SOLUTION. CHECK THIS OUT.
WE HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED SEA LIONS THAT ARE ON OUR DOCKS, AND THIS IS THE DAY THAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR TO SEE WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE BY USING THESE FOUR AIR DANCERS. AND AS WE'VE JUST NOTICED IT CERTAINLY SCOOTED THEM OFF THE DOCKS SAFELY, QUICKLY.

Jimmy: OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS SO CRAZY, MAN. OH, MY GOD, WHAT?
THE UNIVERSE IS SO BIG.
Jimmy: IT CAN BE LIKE ON THE TIP OF YOUR FINGERTIP. YEAH. I MEAN, YOU JUST LOOK GORGEOUS. OH MY GOD. CONGRATULATIONS.
WHAT A DAY.
Jimmy: IT WAS CRAZY HUH?
YEAH IT WAS AMAZING.
Jimmy: AND YOU HAD -- THIS IS TRUE, YOU HAD TOM HANKS WAS THE GUY WHO MARRIED YOU.
THAT WAS AN OFFICIAL TITLE. GUY WHO MARRIED US. [ LAUGHTER ] MOST ESTEEMED TITLE YET, MIGHT I ADD. SCREW THE OSCARS.
Jimmy: HOW DO YOU GET TOM HANKS TO BE THE -- WHAT DO YOU SAY?
AN OFFICIANT.
Jimmy: AN OFFICIANT. I WAS GONNA SAY --
A VERY WEIRD WORD. OFFICIANT.
Jimmy: BUT HE'S ORDAINED?
HE'S ORDAINED. HE'D ALREADY BEEN ORDAINED. WE WERE TALKING TO RITA WILSON WHO PLAYS MY MOM ON "GIRLS" WHO I HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS AND WAS ON HERE THE OTHER NIGHT. AND SHE KILLED IT.
Jimmy: SHE HAS A NEW ALBUM. SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE.
SHE'S SO GREAT. HER NEW SONGS ARE SO GOOD. I CAN GO ON AND ON. BUT WE WERE TALKING TO HER TRYING TO WORK UP THE COURAGE TO ASK HER TO SING AT OUR WEDDING. AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE DIDN'T HAVE AN OFFICIANT YET AND NEITHER ONE OF US ARE PARTICULARLY RELIGIOUS. SO WE WERE SAYING WE JUST WANT SOMEONE WITH CHARISMA WHO IS GOOD AT READING A CROWD --
Jimmy: AHEM. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS -- I GUESS MY E-MAIL WAS DELETED FROM THE --
IT WAS EMMY WEEK, AND I FEEL LIKE YOU WERE PROBABLY PRETTY BUSY, RIGHT?
Jimmy: NO, WE DIDN'T GET NOMINATED THIS YEAR. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT UP.
YEAH YOU'RE SO WELCOME.
Jimmy: YEAH, PROBABLY BUSY.
YOU WERE LUCKY YOU WEREN'T NOMINATED CAUSE I WAS GETTING MARRIED BUT I WAS PROBABLY BUSY. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, I WAS PROBABLY BUSY THAT WEEKEND.
YOU WERE BUSY. YOU HAD A THING, I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS. MAYBE YOU WERE HAVING ANOTHER BABY? WERE YOU HAVING A BABY.
Jimmy: I'M LOSING ALL MY ROLES TO TOM HANKS EVERY TIME. I'M LOSING ALL MY ROLES TO TOM HANKS.
WE ALL ARE DUDE. WE'RE ALL JUST TAKING TOM'S TRASH. WE WERE ASKING HER TO SING. BECAUSE WE WERE SO NERVOUS, WE WERE DESCRIBING WHAT WE WANTED IN AN OFFICIANT. SHE JUST GOES, NOT FOR NOTHING, TOM'S ORDAINED. AND WE WERE LIKE, "BUT IS HE GOOD AT THAT?" [ LAUGHTER ] WOULD HE BE GOOD AT THAT?
Jimmy: BUT HE WOULDN'T BE GOOD AT THAT?
HE'S FUNNY AND CHARMING. DOES HE HAVE LIKE GRAVITAS?
Jimmy: -- I DON'T KNOW. NEVER MIND.
IS HE LIKE WOODY --
Jimmy: I MICHELLE -- HI.
THAT'S -- EXACTLY WHAT I SOUND LIKE. HI, TOM, IT'S ME.
Jimmy: IT'S ALLI.
IT'S ALLI. I'M ALI DOING THIS VOICE. MY NAME ISN'T MY NAME, IT'S
Jimmy: YOU BECOME ALLI.
I'M ALLI. WE'RE GETTING MARRIED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE JUST LEAVING A A MESSAGE. YOU'RE JUST LEAVING A A MESSAGE -- ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YEAH, EXACTLY. IT WAS A WRONG NUMBER ACTUALLY. YES, THAT'S HOW HE -- AND SO IMMEDIATELY WHEN SHE SAID TOM IS ORDANED, WE WERE LIKE, "HE SHOULD MARRY EVERYONE." HE'S THE MOST --
Jimmy: WHY DOESN'T HE JUST DO THAT?
HE'S THE MOST IDEAL OFFICIANT OF ALL TIME. AND AS GOOD AS WE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE AS GOOD WE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE, HE WAS JUST SO GREAT AND SO EXCELLENT. THE BEST.
Jimmy: DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? YOU GO "OH, MY GOSH, THAT'S WEIRD. TOM HANKS MARRIED US."
WE'RE WALKING DOWN THE AISLE TOWARDS HIM, BEING LIKE THAT'S SO FUNNY. THAT'S -- WHAT IS HIS NAME? THAT'S THAT GUY.
Jimmy: I KNOW THAT GUY, YEAH, I KNOW THAT VOICE.
"BIG," RIGHT?
Jimmy: DID YOU CRY?
I LITERALLY CRIED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY TO THE END OF THE DAY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
JUST START TO FINISH. I WORE VERY LITTLE MAKEUP. I HAD POCKETS IN MY DRESS WITH TISSUES IN THEM WHICH WAS THE SMARTEST THING I EVER DID. BECAUSE I WAS JUST LIKE -- IN A A VERY, MY VERSION OF A A JAMES BOND MOMENT WAS LIKE JUST UGLY CRYING AND THEN JUST LIKE WHOOP, OKAY. THANK YOU I GOT MY -- VERY HIGH TECH TISSUE.
Jimmy: HIGH TECH, MADE BY KLEENEX. YEAH. MR. BOND, YEAH. A BIG SPECIAL DAY.
THEY WERE HAPPY TEARS. I WASN'T LIKE WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO IT'S JUST THE MOST FUN. I KNOW THIS IS FAMILY --
AND THE DAD MOMENT.
Jimmy: THE DAD MOMENT. I WOULD'VE -- PLEASE.
I CRIED AT EVERYONE ELSE'S DAD MOMENT. THERE HAVE BEEN WEDDING WHERE I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT THE WEDDING AND I JUST STARTED WEEPING. I'M LIKE BET THEY'RE CLOSE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I KNOW YOU'RE CLOSE YEAH. THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC. AND I WAS READING SOMETHING AND IT SAID LIKE, "OH, YOUR HUSBAND, HE ASKED YOU TO MARRY HIM DURING AN EPISODE OF "THE BACHELOR." TELL US ABOUT "GIRLS." THIS NEXT EPISODE IS A LOT OF MARNEY.
IT'S A MARNEY EPISODE ON SUNDAY NIGHT.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M ALL ABOUT. I LOVE ALLISON WILLIAMS.
THANK YOU. I LIKE WHEN YOU USE MY FULL NAME NEXT TO ME. MAKES ME FEEL REALLY GOOD.
Jimmy: MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A A REAL PAL.
THIS IS A MARNEY EPISODE. AND LENA TOLD ME ABOUT IT WHEN SHE WAS WRITING THE SHOW AND SHE'S IN. SHE'S SO GOOD.
Jimmy: TELL HER I SAID I LOVE HER.
I'LL SEND YOUR LOVE. SHE'S AWESOME. SHE'S WRITING OUR NEXT SEASON. BUT WHEN SHE TOLD ME THEY WERE GOING TO DO A MARNEY EPISODE I WAS LIKE, "OH MY GOD, DON'T GET FREAKED OUT. DON'T GET TOO EXCITED. THINGS CHANGE. DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP. HOPES WENT SKY HIGH. I GOT REALLY EXCITED. AND THEN THANK GOD IT DIDN'T CHANGE AND IT'S STILL A MARNEY EPISODE. SHE GETS IN A FIGHT WITH HER NEW HUSBAND AND THEN --
Jimmy: SHE JOINS SVU. THAT IS VERY INTERESTING.
YOUR WORDS NOT MINE.
Jimmy: SPOILER ALERT.
I AM AVAILABLE AFTER AUGUST CAUSE "GIRLS" IS OVER. SO CALL ME.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP OF ALLISON WILLIAMS IN THIS SUNDAY'S EPISODE OF "GIRLS." JUST TAKE A LOOK AT MARNEY.
WOULD YOU PREFER THAT I PRETEND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME AND STOP FEELING ALL OF MY FEELINGS AND HUG YOU AND -- YOU AND TELL YOU HOW AMAZING YOU ARE AND HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU?
THAT'S REALLY POSITIVE TO ME. I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY.
NO.
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST RECOILED FROM MY TOUCH.
I DIDN'T.
YOU RECOILED FROM MY TOUCH LIKE I'M A MONSTER.
OH MY GOD.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING? IN ALL THE MONTHS THAT WE COURTED, I NEVER DREAMED THAT YOU COULD BE THIS CRUEL.
CRUEL?
YEAH.
ARE YOU -- SERIOUS? CRUEL? I DON'T WANT TO GET A SCONE WITH YOU THIS MORNING AND NOW I'M CRUEL? [ APPLAUSE ]
