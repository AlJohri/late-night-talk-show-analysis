Jimmy: HEY! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE! WELCOME. HOT CROWD, BABY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE. YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE AT THE SHOW. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I APPRECIATE THIS. LET'S GET TO WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. THESE ARE THE BIG STORIES HERE. BIG, BIG POLITICAL NEWS OVER THE WEEKEND. THAT'S RIGHT. DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT HE IS THINKING VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT A A 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. YOU CAN TELL HE'S SERIOUS BECAUSE TODAY I SAW HIM SHAKING HANDS AND FIRING BABIES. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S SERIOUS. IT'S REAL. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU SUCK YOUR THUMB TOO MUCH. YOU SUCK YOUR THUMB TOO MUCH IN THE BOARD MEETINGS. [ LAUGHTER ] GERALDO, SHOULD I FIRE HER? THAT'S RIGHT. THE BIG NEWS, THOUGH, IS THAT MITT ROMNEY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS CONSIDERING A THIRD CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY. YEAH. HE MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON FRIDAY DURING A PRIVATE MEETING WITH DONORS. PRETTY SHOCKING. THAT MITT ROMNEY NEEDS DONORS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS HE, A TRILLIONAIRE? OF COURSE LAST NIGHT WAS THE GOLDEN GLOBES. DID YOU WATCH THE GOLDEN GLOBES? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EVERYONE LOVES A GOOD AWARDS SHOW. ONE OF THE BIG MOMENTS WAS WHEN JOHN LEGEND TOOK HOME A GOLDEN GLOBE FOR BEST ORIGINAL SONG AND WHILE HE WAS GIVING HIS ACCEPTANCE SPEECH THE CAMERAS DECIDED TO CHECK OUT HIS WIFE, CHRISSY TEIGEN'S REACTION.
HE SAID, JOHN I WANT TO HELP -- I WANT YOU TO HELP ME WRITE A A SONG FOR THIS FILM, AND I'M SO HONORED. I WAS BROUGHT ON AT THE LAST MINUTE BUT I'M SO HONORED TO BE A PART OF THIS AMAZING FILM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I CAN'T TELL IF SHE'S HAPPY FOR HIM OR TRYING TO REMEMBER IF SHE LOCKED THE DOOR BEFORE SHE LEFT THE HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE FILM "BOYHOOD" WON THE GOLDEN GLOBE FOR BEST DRAMA. [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S GREAT. "BOYHOOD," IT FOLLOWS ONE GUY'S JOURNEY OVER THE COURSE OF 12 YEARS. OR AS MITT ROMNEY CALLS, THAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] 4, 8, 12 YEARS. DID YOU SEE THIS? LAST NIGHT AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES, A DRONE WAS USED ON THE RED CARPET TO FILM CELEBRITIES AND OFFER A BIRD'S EYE VIEW. AND THE BEST PART IS YOU COULDN'T EVEN TELL THAT IT WAS THERE. CHECK IT OUT. [ LOUD BUZZING ] OH, HEY. WHO ARE YOU WEARING? OH MY GOD. VERY CLASSY. WHAT IS THAT THING? I THOUGHT IT SEEMED A LITTLE UNSAFE TO HAVE A DRONE FLYING RIGHT ABOVE THEIR HEADS. I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS MOMENT DURING A RED CARPET INTERVIEW.
THE PORTRAL DEFINITELY DOES JUSTICE TO DETROIT. GOOD LUCK THEN IF IT COME OUT --
Jimmy: JUST SHOCKING TO SEE THAT. YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT TYPE OF STUFF. YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING THAT.
Steve: WHERE IN THE WORLD IS MATT LAUER?
Jimmy: HE'S FINE. HE'S FINE. THIS JUST IN. HE'S FINE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND AS ALWAYS, RYAN SEACREST, OUR PAL RYAN SEACREST, HE WAS ALSO ON THE RED CARPET TALKING TO ALL THE STARS, BUT TO ME IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS DISTRACTED BY SOMETHING ELSE. TAKE A LOOK.

THANK YOU. I WILL NOT FALL.
YES, DO NOT FALL.

YEAH. WE LITERALLY WERE JUST BORROWING FRIENDS' CAMERAS AND POINTING THEM AT EACH OTHER. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I ACTUALLY OWE THE ROOTS AN APOLOGY. BECAUSE THE FIRST TWO TIMES I CAME OUT ON THE SHOW, THEY PLAYED SONGS FROM "SUNNY." AND I USUALLY AM SUCH A DEER IN THE HEADLIGHTS, AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I'D GO HOME AND WATCH THE SHOW, AND THEY'RE PLAYING THE "DAY MAN" SONG. SO GUYS, THANK YOU FOR THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

NO, I REMEMBER.
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW COOL THIS DUDE IS, JUST JUMPED ON A HORSE LIKE A COP. HE'S LIKE "LET'S GO BUDDY."
I KNEW MY FRIEND'S FATHER, IS LIKE A DIEHARD BOSTON FAN HAVING A HEART ATTACK, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING BOGGSY?" "GET OFF THE HORSE!" [ LAUGHS ]
Jimmy: GET OFF THE HORSE. HE'S WADE BOGGS.
YEAH, I'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST HIM. ANYWAY, HE WAS FAMOUS FOR BASEBALL. HE WAS ALSO FAMOUS FOR THE AMOUNT OF BEER HE COULD DRINK.
Jimmy: I HEARD THESE STORIES.
YEAH, SO, SUPPOSEDLY WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE THESE CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHTS HE WOULD DRINK ON AVERAGE 40 TO 50, SOME SAY 70 BEERS. LIKE, HE'S GOT LIKE A --
Jimmy: FROM L.A. TO NEW YORK?
YEAH.
Jimmy: LIKE A SIX-HOUR FLIGHT?
IT WAS LIKE A LAYOVER SOMEWHERE IN NORTH DAKOTA. I DON'T KNOW. SO OUR CHARACTERS ARE TRYING TO BREAK THAT RECORD IN THE EPISODE.
Jimmy: YOU GUYS ARE ALL GOING TO FLY, AND SEE IF YOU CAN BREAK THE RECORD.
YEAH, AND THEN SEE IF WE CAN GO HIT A BASEBALL THE NEXT DAY. NOT ONLY WOULD HE DRINK 70 BEERS, BUT THEN HE'D GO LIKE, THREE FOR FOUR.
Jimmy: HE'S A MAGICIAN, THIS GUY.
HE'S GOT LIKE A HOT DOG EATING STOMACH, BUT FOR BEER.
Jimmy: I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
YEAH, SO THE GANG GETS ON A A PLANE AND THEY TRY TO BREAK THE RECORD. OF COURSE, THEY'RE DEBAUCHEROUS.
Jimmy: YOUR CHARACTER STARTS TO HALLUCINATE.
I HALLUCINATE, AND ACTUALLY START SPEAKING TO WADE BOGGS.
Jimmy: YOU GOT THE REAL WADE BOGGS TO COME ON THE SHOW.
YEAH. WE REACHED OUT TO HIM. IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY WITH THIS? AND HE'S LIKE "OH, I'LL DO IT."
Jimmy: HOW WAS HE?
HE WAS GREAT. HE WAS GREAT. ALTHOUGH I'M PRETTY SURE HE WAS DRINKING ACTUAL BEER WHEN WE WERE FILMING. WE ALL HAD PROP BEER, AND THEN I NOTICED AT SOME POINT, HE'S DRINKING NOW. LIKE, HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, BUT A HIGHLY FUNCTIONING. HIGHLY FUNCTIONING.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, NO. HE SHOULD DO IT, I MEAN IF HE CAN HANDLE 70 BEERS --
WELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE REAL -- THE ACTUAL NUMBER, HE PULLED ME ASIDE AND SAID, "CHARLIE, REALLY IT WAS 107." [ LAUGHS ]
Jimmy: WHAT?
YEAH, HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
Jimmy: I SHOULD GET JEFF MUSIAL OUT HERE FOR THE MATH. BUT SIX HOURS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY HAVE THEM ON A PLANE.
NOT SIX HOURS. SO HE WOULD COME TO THE AIRPORT ABOUT 12 DEEP AND THEN HE WOULD BE ON THE PLANE AND JUST FIRING THEM BACK. AND THEN THEY HAVE THE LAYOVER. AND THEN THEY WOULD GO OUT THAT NIGHT. AND THEN HE'D HIT THIRD AND HIT TWO DOUBLES.
Jimmy: GOOD GOD, THAT'S AN AMAZING MAN.
AND SO, IT MAKES FOR A GOOD EPISODE.
Jimmy: 107 BEERS.
107.
Jimmy: WADE BOGGS. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S CHARLIE DAY AND WADE BOGGS IN THE SEASON PREMIERE OF "IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
HELLO, CHARLIE.

I'M NOT A GHOST, CHARLIE. YOU'RE JUST HALLUCINATING. YOU HAD OVER 30 BEERS, DUDE.
YOU DID? NICE, MAN.
YOU KNOW YOUR FRIEND MAC IS RIGHT.
OH YEAH?
I DIDN'T WIN FIVE BATTING TITLES BECAUSE IT WAS FUN.

I WON IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE THE BEST. DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
NAH, NOT REALLY, MAN.
THERE'S NOTHING MORE FUN THAN WINNING. SO COME ON. DRINK UP. I'LL HAVE ONE WITH YOU.
NICE, LET'S DO IT, BOGGS. LET'S DRINK.

I'M FAMILIAR WITH WHAT MOVIES ARE, YEAH.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD, YEAH. YOU THINK YOU KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT MOVIES THAT MAYBE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SUMMARIZE THEM IN JUST FIVE SECONDS?
I KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT SUMMARIZING.
Jimmy: SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT. IT'S TIME TO PLAY A GAME CALLED "5-SECOND SUMMARIES." ♪♪ [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HERE'S HOW THE GAME WORKS. I HAVE A STACK OF CARDS HERE. EACH CARD HAS A MOVIE TITLE ON IT. AS SOON AS YOU LOOK AT THE CARD, YOU HAVE FIVE SECONDS TO DESCRIBE THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE THE BEST YOU CAN AND TRY TO MAKE ME GUESS WHICH MOVIE IT IS. OKAY? YOU CAN'T USE ANY WORDS IN THE TITLE OR SAY ANY OF THE ACTORS' NAMES. YOU'RE JUST DESCRIBING THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE.
WHY WOULD I? YEAH.
Jimmy: FIVE SECONDS. VERY GOOD. LAST TIME I DID THIS WAS WITH ANDY SAMBERG AND WE GOT FOUR CORRECT ANSWERS. WE'RE WORKING AS A TEAM HERE.

DIDN'T THEY PUSH HIM AROUND IN A WHEELCHAIR?
Jimmy: NO, THEY CARRIED HIM AROUND. ATTACHED HIM TO FISHING.
THE WHEELCHAIR HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
Jimmy: THESE ARE ALL THREE SECONDS. I SHOULD HAVE REMINDED YOU.
HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN A A WHEELCHAIR.
Jimmy: HE WAS NOT IN A A WHEELCHAIR.

Jimmy: WELL, WHATEVER. ONE PERSON.
ONE PERSON WHO REMEMBERS IT THAT WAY.
Jimmy: READY? HERE WE GO. A DORK. A JOCK. A CHEERLEADER -- [ BUZZER ]

Jimmy: CLOSE ENOUGH. DID WE GET IT IN TIME? BECAUSE I CAN GUESS IT NOW.
YOU'VE GOT TO GUESS IT.
Jimmy: "AUSTIN POWERS." SORRY, YOU WENT UP TOP.
HIGHER THAN LOW.
Jimmy: YOU WENT UP TOP. I SHOULD HAVE JUST DONE THAT.
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. WE'RE NOT GOOD AT ANYTHING.
Jimmy: YOU WENT UP HIGH AND I WAS LIKE "YEAH, COOL MAN! I'VE NEVER SLAPPED FIVES BEFORE.
IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME. FIRST TIME.
