NOW THAT THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE OVER, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS INVITED CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS FROM BOTH PARTIES TO A MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE TOMORROW. WHEN ASKED IF HE IS NERVOUS, OBAMA SAID, "OH, I'M NOT GONNA BE THERE. I JUST INVITED THEM. THIS CAN FIGURE IT OUT WITH THEMSELVES." [ APPLAUSE ] REPUBLICANS WINNING THE SENATE HAS BEEN TOUGH ON PRESIDENT OBAMA BUT YESTERDAY, HE DECIDED TO LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THINGS. TAKE A LOOK.
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I WOULD ENJOY HAVING SOME KENTUCKY BOURBON WITH MITCH McCONNELL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: A LITTLE BOURBON WITH THE KENTUCKY SENATOR, OR YOU OR ANYONE OR BY MYSELF. I DON'T CARE. JUST GIVE ME THAT BOURBON. I JUST WANT THAT BOURBON. IT'S BEEN A ROUGH WEEK. IN FACT, AFTER HEARING THE REST OF HIS SPEECH, I THINK THE PRESIDENT MIGHT ALREADY BEEN DRINKING. WATCH.

AFTER A LITTLE MORE BOURBON, OBAMA RESPONDED, "THASS NOTTA A A BAD IDEA. YA KNOW, YOU'RE ACTUALLY A A PRETTY COOL DUDE SOMETIMES." McCONNELL SAID, "HEHE YOU TOO. HEY WANNA PLAY SOME MUSSZIC ON THE JUKEBOX?" THEN OBAMA SAID, "LEZ PLAY 'SWEET EMOTION' BY AEROSMITH." McCONNELL SAID, "OOOH BIG SURPRISE! THASS 10TH TIME YOU PLAYED THAT SONG. ISS MY TURN." OBAMA SAID, "SIDDOWN TURTLE BOY! IMMA PLAY AIRSMITH." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, THEN IT APPEARS THEY BOTH PASSED OUT FOR A FEW HOURS, UNTIL THIS NEXT QUOTE FROM McCONNELL THE FOLLOWING MORNING.

OPENS UP TO A PAGE THAT'S MARKED. SHE GOES, "HERE, READ THAT POEM." I READ IT AND IT SAYS, "IF ALL THAT I WOULD WANT TO DO WOULD BE TO SIT AND TALK TO YOU, WOULD YOU LISTEN?" AND IT WAS BY, I THOUGHT, E. E. CUMMINGS OR AMY ASHFORD. SOMEBODY LIKE THAT. NOT ME. SHE GOES, "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?" AND I GO, "I THINK THAT'S GREAT." SHE GOES, "WELL THEN WRITE THAT." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I GO, "BUT IT'S A POETRY CONTEST. YOU WANT ME TO WRITE IT AND PUT THEIR NAME?" SHE GOES, "NO, YOU WRITE IT AND PUT YOUR NAME ON IT."

NO, NO, BECAUSE THOSE SPOILERS, WE GOT PEOPLE WATCHING ME RIGHT NOW. THEY'D THROW DARTS YOU KNOW IF I SAID TOO MUCH. ANYWAY, IT'S ALSO A GREAT LOVE STORY BETWEEN A FATHER AND A A DAUGHTER. IT'S A VERY INTIMATE LOVE STORY, BUT IT GOES FURTHER OUT THERE INTO SPACE, THAN WE'VE EVER GONE ON FILM BEFORE. FURTHER OUT IN SPACE THAN I'VE EVER EVEN READ BEFORE. SO IT'S AN ENORMOUS MOVIE, BUT, THE WILD THING ABOUT IT IS THE FURTHER OUT THERE YOU GET, IF YOU WANNA GO FOR THE SCI-FI AND FOR JUST THE FACT IF I WANNA GO SURF A 1,600 FOOT WAVE IN A A SPACESHIP, WHICH IS A GREAT REASON TO GO, IT'S STILL A A GREAT LOVE STORY. AND ABOUT A FATHER AND A CHILD AND HAVING TO SAY GOODBYE. AND WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT. MOST EXTREME CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IN THIS MOVIE IS MY GUY, COOPER, THE FATHER, IS LEAVING TO GO OFF INTO SPACE AND I OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE A A GUARANTEED RETURN TICKET. ANYWAY, IT'S AN ENORMOUS MOVIE, BUT IT'S VERY PERSONAL, VERY INTIMATE AND I THINK IT'S AMAZING WHAT THIS GUY NOLAN PUT TOGETHER.
Jimmy: THIS GUY --
WHAT HE CAN SEE IN HIS MIND, AND PUTS ON SCREEN, HOW DO WE GET THIS?

I KNOW, I WANTED TO LIKE PEARL IT OUT OR SOMETHING BECAUSE I'M WEARING PEARLS. DON'T HAVE IT IN ME BUT UH --
Jimmy: IT'S NOW THE TIME TO BLING OUT YOUR BAND AIDS.
YOU KNOW, THE CLASSIC CUTTING AN AVOCADO, GOT THE PIT STUCK, WENT -- AS I WAS TRYING TO PULL THE PIT OUT, THOUGHT TO MYSELF, "WOW THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS." AND LITERALLY AS I THOUGHT THE WORD "DANGEROUS," I SLICED. WAS HOME ALONE, TRIED TO CALL ALL THESE PEOPLE ON A SATURDAY MORNING. NOBODY ANSWERS THEIR PHONE ANYMORE BECAUSE EVERYBODY TEXTS. ALL THE TIME.
Jimmy: I'M SLEEPING, DUDE.
WHY IS BETH CALLING YOU? OH, IGNORE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M BLEEDING, I'M DYING WITH MY LEFT HAND.
FINALLY, MY LOVELY BUSINESS MANAGER, WHO IS WONDERFUL, PICKED UP HER PHONE, WHO IS A A NEIGHBOR. SHE CAME AND GOT ME, I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. I HAD NEVER HAD STITCHES BEFORE. VERY NERVOUS. I TOLD THE DOCTOR, I NEVER HAD STITCHES BEFORE. AND HE SAID, "THAT'S SO CRAZY BECAUSE I'VE NEVER GIVEN -- GIVEN STITCHES. I HAVE NEVER DONE STITCHES BEFORE."
Jimmy: YOU'RE JOKING?
AND I SAID, "YOU SEEM LOVELY. HOWEVER -- I WOULD REALLY LIKE SOMEONE --" AND THEN HE KIND OF LET ME GO ON FOR A FEW MINUTES. AND HE WAS JOKING.
Jimmy: OH, I DON'T LIKE THAT.
HE WAS HILAIRIOUS.
Jimmy: I DON'T LIKE DOCTORS WHO JOKE. I DON'T EVER GO BACK TO DOCTORS WHO JOKE.
BE A COMEDIAN THEN! COME ON!
Jimmy: YES, DON'T BE A A DOCTOR IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS WHILE I'M BLEEDING. THAT -- THAT'S A SCARY THING.
IT WAS, YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THAT'S -- I FELL LIKE THAT'S A LOT OF BLOOD FROM THAT PART.
IT WAS. AND I WAS IN SHOCK -- LIKE REALLY COOL ABOUT IT AT FIRST AND THEN WHEN I SAW THE TENDON, LIKE --
Jimmy: DID YOU PUT -- OH. DID YOU PUT IT LIKE A BAGGY WITH ICE OR ANYTHING?
AT FIRST, I DID PAPER TOWELS AND I'M LIKE, "THIS ISN'T WORKING." AND THEN I DID A TOWEL THAT WAS WHITE, WHICH WAS THE WORST IDEA.
Jimmy: BLOODY --
THREW THAT AWAY ON THE WAY OUT THE DOOR.
Jimmy: BLOOD ALL OVER -- OH MY GOSH. AND ARE YOU RIGHT-HANDED?
I'M LEFT-HANDED. SO ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT HORRIBLE.

Jimmy: EW, AND JUST SMELLS LIKE KOMBUCHA AND YOU --
