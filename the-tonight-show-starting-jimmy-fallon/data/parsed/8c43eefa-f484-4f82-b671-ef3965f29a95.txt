AND THEN THEIR PRESIDENT, VIKTOR YANUKOVYCH, HE WENT ON THE RUN. HE'S HANGING OUT SOMEWHERE, PARTYING. AND THERE ARE REPORTS NOW THAT RUSSIA HAS GRANTED PROTECTION TO YANUKOVYCH.

NO ONE WILL KNOW. WEAR GET A BLANKET.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH. HOW ABOUT THE REST OF THE TEAM? THE ATHLETES?
I HEARD SOME STORIES, MAN. I MEAN, A LOT OF THE GUYS WERE AT THE VILLAGE. AND, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE TAKING SHOWERS. AND THE ONE SNOWBOARDER WAS TAKING A LONG SHOWER. WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S UP TO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOPEFULLY MAKING SURE HIS HAIR IS CLEAN.
OF COURSE, OF COURSE. AND THE WHOLE FLOOR FLOODED. AND IT WENT AND LIKE DRIPPED ON THE BOBSLEDDERS' BED. AND THEY'RE OUT AT PRACTICE, AND THEY COME BACK IT'S JUST LIKE A MONSON.
Jimmy: SHEETS OF ICE. YEAH. OH MY GOD, REALLY?
YEAH. GLAD TO BE BACK.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, YEAH. WELCOME BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOUR WALLS. YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST DECORATED SNOWBOARDERS. AND YOU HAD GOOD RUNS IN THE HALFPIPE THING. THEN YOU GO, I'M NOT FEELING THIS ONE, I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS ONE, RIGHT? YOU'RE JUST LIKE, I CAN'T. WHAT HAPPENED?
TOUGH SETUP. I MEAN, OUT THERE, BASICALLY YOU HAVE THREE DAYS TO PRACTICE AND THE PIPE WAS PRETTY MUCH UNRIDEABLE FOR THREE DAYS BECAUSE OF THE -- I DON'T KNOW, JUST THE SNOW CONDITIONS WERE REALLY BIZARRE. IT'S LIKE A SANDY CONSISTENCY. AND -- THERE'S PHOTOS, THEY HAD LIKE A FIRE HOSE, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO ICE IT DOWN AND DO ALL THESE THINGS.
A FIRE HOSE?
I DON'T KNOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE TIGER WOODS PLAYING ON A CRAPPY PUBLIC COURSE. I CAN'T PLAY HERE, MAN. I CAN'T DO THIS.
BECAUSE THERE IS FIRE HOSES.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S -- YEAH. YOU SHOULD DO A TRICK CALLED THE FIRE HOSE. YEAH, THAT'LL BE A LITTLE NOD TO THE SOCHI OLYMPICS. YEAH. DO YOU BUILD IT UP LIKE IT'S SUCH A GIANT DEAL IN YOUR HEAD OR DO YOU JUST FOCUS BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST A GOOD ATHLETE?
IT'S ALL THE ABOVE. I MEAN, I'M JUST A COMPETITIVE PERSON. SO, ANY SCENARIO I WANT TO DO WELL, I WANT TO SUCCEED. IT'S JUST A TOUGH OFF NIGHT FOR ME. BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE OR BREAK MY CAREER IN THAT SENSE. I LOVE GOING TO THE OLYMPICS. AND JUST BEING AN OLYMPIAN IS PART OF THE WHOLE SPECIAL THING. YOU KNOW, YOU GO AND REPRESENT THE U.S.
Jimmy: OH, ABSOLUTELY. [ CHEERS ] WE LOVE YOU. WE ALL LOVE YOU. WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU. AND THE GUY -- I LIKE THE GUY WHO WON, I CAN'T PRONOUNCE HIS NAME.
IOURI.
Jimmy: IOURI.
THEY CALL HIM I-POD.
Jimmy: YEAH, THE LAST NAME IS WHAT I COULDN'T PRONOUNCE.
OH, PODLADTCHIKOV.
Jimmy: THERE, PERFECT, PODLADTCHIKOV. IS IT IOURI? STARTS WITH AN "I"?
UH-HUH. YEAH.
Jimmy: THEY CALL HIM I-POD.
THEY CALL HIM I-POD.
Jimmy: WHICH IS A GREAT NICKNAME. YEAH, I LIKE THAT. ARE YOU FRIENDS?
WE ARE. YEAH. I'M ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO SEE HIM LATER TONIGHT.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: ARE YOU GOING TO SKATEBOARD AROUND TOWN?
HE'S HAVING A LITTLE PARTY. HE DOESN'T KNOW I'M GOING, I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW UP.
Jimmy: YEAH! YOU SHOULD SHOW UP WITH YOUR TWO GOLD MEDALS. LIKE I GOT TWO, SUCKER! [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH. I'M GOING TO CRASH HIS PARTY. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
Jimmy: YOU GET SOME NEW TRICKS. AND WHAT I ALWAYS -- PEOPLE PROPOSE ALWAYS TO NAME THE TRICKS FOR YOU. BECAUSE THEY HAVE CRAZY NAMES. LIKE, HE DID THE YOLO FLIP. AND YOU CALL ONE, TOMAHAWK. NOW, WHY IS IT CALLED TOMAHAWK?
IT WAS NAMED AFTER A STEAK THAT I ATE THE NIGHT BEFORE.
Jimmy: THAT MAKES SENSE, ABSOLUTELY.
IT STILL LIKE --
Jimmy: WHAT'S A TOMAHAWK STEAK?
-- I THINK IT PUSH ME TO DO THE TRICK.
Jimmy: THAT STEAK, REALLY? WHAT IS A TOMAHAWK STEAK?
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S OUT OF THE FLINTSTONES, BASICALLY. LIKE A BIG PIECE OF MEAT WITH A A BIG BONE ON IT AND LIKE --
Jimmy: WILL YOU DRAW IT?
SHAPED LIKE A -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S SHAPED --
Jimmy: YEAH, I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A TOMAHAWK STEAK.
IT'S GOT THIS SORT OF GOING ON, THAT'S THE BONE, I GUESS. AND THEN THERE'S LIKE THE BIG KIND OF LIKE -- MEAT FLAVOR. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU EVER THINK OF GETTING INTO CARTOONS OR SOMETHING, SHAUN?
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY GOOD, HUH.
Jimmy: YOU COULD WORK AT PIXAR, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT TO SAY, WE'RE HAVING YOUR BAND ON.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A BAND. BAD THINGS, THE NAME OF THE BAND. YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DEBUT ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW" NEXT WEEK.
YEAH, I'M SO EXCITED.
Jimmy: YOU PLAY GUITAR?
I DO, I PLAY GUITAR. IT'S STRANGE HOW IT ALL CAME TOGETHER. I WON A GUITAR AT A SNOWBOARD CONTEST. THAT'S HOW MIXED THE SPORT IS WITH --
Jimmy: WHAT? YOU WON THE CONTEST, THEY GAVE YOU A GUITAR?
AS A TROPHY, YEAH.
Jimmy: THANKS, I GUESS. HERE'S A CLARINET, CONGRATULATIONS. [ LAUGHTER ]
I WON A CAR AS WELL.
Jimmy: A CAR?
WHICH KIND OF LIKE DWARFED THE GUITAR. OH, A CAR.
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
AND SO, I HAD THIS GUITAR, AND IT WAS UNDER MY FRIEND'S BED FOR LIKE, A WHILE.
Jimmy: YOU GAVE TO IT YOUR FRIEND?
YEAH, I THINK AT THAT POINT I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE IT HOME WITH ME ON THE PLANE.
Jimmy: IT MUST HAVE REALLY MEANT A LOT TO YOU, THAT TROPHY, THANKS SO MUCH --
IT WAS BRIGHT YELLOW, AND IT WAS JUST TERRIBLE. BUT IT WAS AWESOME. IT WAS LIKE AN AMERICAN FENDER STRAT.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
PLAYED IT IN SECRET IN MY ROOM. BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO SEE ME ON THIS YELLOW GUITAR. BUT I GOT HOOKED. I STARTED PLAYING WITH FRIENDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, SOME OF THOSE FRIENDS ARE STILL IN THE BAND.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
AND THEN I MOVED TO LOS ANGELES AND THAT'S WHEN THINGS JUST REALLY KICKED OFF. I MET THE LEAD SINGER AND BASS PLAYER AND IT'S SO MUCH FUN.
Jimmy: DO YOU SING?
I DO A LITTLE LIKE OFF THE MIC BACKUP.
Jimmy: OFF THE MICROPHONE SINGING? THAT'S GOOD. BUT, I MEAN, DID YOU -- ARE YOU GOING TO GET SIGNED?
WE ARE SIGNED. YEAH, WE GOT SIGNED TO WARNER BROTHERS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
