OF COURSE, IT'S LAST NIGHT'S BIG FINALE OF "THE BACHELOR." [ CHEERS ] I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANY SPOILERS, SO IF YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHO WON, COVER YOUR EYES AND PLUG YOUR EARS BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW. BUT LAST NIGHT ON "THE BACHELOR" BEN HIGGINS WOUND UP PROPOSING TO FLIGHT ATTENDANT LAUREN B. OOH. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] BEN SAYS HE CANNOT WAIT TO GET MARRIED SO HE CAN FINALLY FIND OUT WHAT THE "B" STANDS FOR. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S LIKE, "SHE'S NEVER TOLD ME. IT COULD BE ANYTHING. I'M SO EXCITED!" [ APPLAUSE ] AND AS YOU'D EXPECT, PICKING BETWEEN THE FINAL TWO WOMEN WAS A REALLY DIFFICULT DECISION FOR BEN TO MAKE. AND I THINK HE MAY WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT TO THE VIEWERS AT HOME HOW DIFFICULT THIS WAS. WATCH.
I'M IN LOVE WITH TWO WOMEN. I LOVE TWO WOMEN. I'M IN LOVE WITH TWO WOMEN. TELLING TWO WOMEN THAT I'M IN LOVE WITH THEM -- BUT NOW I'M IN LOVE WITH TWO WOMEN. BUT NOW I HAVE TWO WOMEN THAT LOVE ME. BEING IN LOVE WITH TWO WOMEN IS TEARING ME APART. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

[ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE TOUGHEST DECISION SOMEONE ON "THE BACHELOR" HAD TO MAKE SINCE "SHOULD I RUIN MY LIFE BY BEING ON 'THE BACHELOR'?" [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE FIRST -- [ APPLAUSE ] YOU MAKE THAT DECISION, THEN YOU MAKE -- THAT GUY MUST BE A NIGHTMARE AT RESTAURANTS. LIKE, "I'M IN LOVE WITH TWO DIFFERENT APPETIZERS." [ LAUGHTER ] THINKING ABOUT THE JALAPENO POPPERS, BUT, UH -- MOZZARELLA STICKS? [ LAUGHTER ] HOT POPPERS. JUST KIDDING. STICKS. [ LAUGHTER ] DURING LAST NIGHT'S FINALE A LOT OF FANS WERE SNAPCHATTING THEIR REACTIONS THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE. KINDA FUN.

SOME PEOPLE ARE EVEN CALLING IT SUPER TUESDAY III. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] MARCO RUBIO'S JUST CALLING IT "MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] DID YOU SEE THIS? A NEW POLL FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF MILLENNIALS WOULD VOTE HILLARY CLINTON OVER DONALD TRUMP. THEN MILLENNIALS FOUND OUT THAT YOU CAN'T VOTE BY TEXTING AND SAID, "OH, NEVER MIND. I'M -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S TOO HARD FOR ME, MAN. I'M VOTING FOR PHILLIP PHILLIPS." [ LAUGHTER ] "VOTE FOR ME. JUST TEXT 'DAMN DANIEL' TO 389 --" [ LAUGHTER ]
DAMN, DANIEL.

Steve: THAT'S THICK. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: "SORRY, LARRY!" OUR OWN NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL De BLASIO RECENTLY WEIGHED IN ON TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN, CALLING DONALD TRUMP A RACIST AND SAID THAT HE PARTICIPATES IN THE WORST KIND OF RACISM BECAUSE HE'S JUST USING IT TO GET AHEAD. RAISING THE QUESTION, WHAT IS THE BEST TYPE OF RACISM? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT'S THE BEST TYPE OF RACISM? WHY, WHEN YOU DO IT -- WHEN YOU DO IT JUST FOR YOURSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU REALLY FEEL IT FROM IN HERE. YEAH.

BERNIE SANDERS WAS ALSO AT A TOWN HALL RECENTLY WHERE HE TOOK QUESTIONS FROM SUPPORTERS WHO A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY ARE MOSTLY YOUNG WHITE MEN. BUT I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE EVEN MORE IN COMMON THAN THAT. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS GUY WHO ASKED BERNIE A QUESTION HERE.
MY QUESTION IS, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF WHO MAY WANT A CAREER IN WALL STREET OR BIG BUSINESS?
Jimmy: SEEMS LIKE A NICE YOUNG MAN. JUST A FEW MINUTES LATER ANOTHER GUY ASKED A QUESTION.
