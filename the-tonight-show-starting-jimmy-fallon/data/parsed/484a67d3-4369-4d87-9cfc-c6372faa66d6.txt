MUSICAL GUEST, PITBULL FEATURING G.R.L. AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW. AND NOW, HERE'S YOUR HOST -- JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HOW ARE YOU ALL DOING TONIGHT? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY. OH! THAT'S A HOT CROWD OUT THERE TONIGHT. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. MAKES YA FEEL GOOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. OH, IT'S A HOT CROWD. WE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PITBULL, G.R.L. WE GOTA A LOT OF, LOT OF GOOD STUFF. SAMUEL L. JACKSON, MINNIE DRIVER. A BIG SHOW TONIGHT. YEAH, HERE, LET'S JUST FIRST TALK ABOUT -- WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT, MY FAVORITE SHOW. LAST NIGHT WAS THE THIRD EPISODE OF "DANCING WITH THE STARS." [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS DRAMATIC. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FIRST OF ALL, "PRICE IS RIGHT" HOST, FRIEND OF OUR SHOW, DREW CAREY HAD THE LOWEST SCORE OF THE NIGHT. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] I MEAN, YOU KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE BAD WHEN HE FINISHED HIS DANCE AND YOU HEARD THIS. [ OOMPAH HORN ] [ LAUGHTER ] THE JUDGE SHOWED THEIR SCORES, THE CROWD WAS GOING, "LOWER, LOWER!" THEY GO, "NO, STOP YELLING THAT." BUT IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD NIGHT FOR ICE DANCER MERYL DAVIS, WHO GOT A 39 OUT OF 40 -- WHILE HER OLYMPIC PARTNER, CHARLIE WHITE GOT A 36. WHICH WOULD BE FANTASTIC SCORES IF THEY WEREN'T PROFESSIONAL DANCERS COMPETING AGAINST DREW CAREY, OUR COMEDIAN FRIEND. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU SHOULD BE GOOD, YOU'RE AN ICE -- YOU'RE OLYMPIC --
Steve: COME ON!
Jimmy: I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. AND THIS IS TOO BAD. OUR PAL, BILLY DEE WILLIAMS HAD TO LEAVE "DANCING WITH THE STARS" BECAUSE HE WAS HAVING BACK PAIN. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] YEAH, I KNOW, WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE I THOUGHT HIS PARTNER WAS THE ONE WHO DID ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING. [ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ I THINK I JUST HURT MY BACK DOING THAT RIGHT THERE. I JUST HURT MY BACK THERE. GOSH, WE WERE ROOTING FOR THAT GUY.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: BUMMER. WELL, YESTERDAY WAS THE BIG DEADLINE TO SIGN UP FOR OBAMACARE AND THE WHITE HOUSE SEEMS VERY HAPPY. THEY SAID THAT 7 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED UP. WHEN ASKED HOW MANY PEOPLE TRIED TO SIGN UP, THEY WERE LIKE, "30 MILLION." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHAT?
Jimmy: WHAT'S THAT?
Steve: WHAT WAS THAT AGAIN?
Jimmy: OH, NOTHING. JUST EVERYTHING IS A BIG SUCCESS. EVERYTHING'S GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HOW MANY SIGNED UP? [ MUMBLING ] I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
Jimmy: WELL IT MUST BE WINDY IN HERE. I'M SO SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: 70 MILLION.
Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT, THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THAT IT SURPASSED ITS GOAL FOR PEOPLE ENROLLED IN OBAMACARE. IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE WHEN YOU MAKE SOMETHING MANDATORY AND FINE PEOPLE IF THEY DON'T DO IT. AND THEN KEEP EXTENDING THE DEADLINE FOR MONTHS. IT'S LIKE A CINDERELLA STORY. IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFUL THING. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU MAKE EVERYONE DO IT. ISN'T IT GREAT HOW MANY PEOPLE DO IT? BUT IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T ENROLLED, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY A PENALTY CALLED THE INDIVIDUAL SHARED RESPONSIBILITY PAYMENT, WHICH IS 1% OF YOUR SALARY. THEN AMERICANS SAID, "MAN, GOOD THING I DON'T HAVE A JOB." [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE THEN I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE MY -- [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, OBAMA STILL GOT HIS HANDS FULL WITH RUSSIA AND GET THIS -- OFFICIALS IN FINLAND SAY THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY IS NOW CONDUCTING DRILLS ON ITS BORDER. OR AS PUTIN CALLS IT -- [ IMITATING PUTIN ] "WINDOW SHOPPING." THE GUY SCARES ME. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE THE OTHER BIG NEWS THIS WEEK IS THE BIG CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT FROM THE U.N. EXPERTS ARE VERY CONCERNED. IN FACT, THEY'RE SAYING THAT CLIMATE CHANGE COULD START THREATENING THE WORLD'S SUPPLY OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. AND AMERICANS ARE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, WELL LET US KNOW WHEN IT STARTS AFFECTING HOT POCKETS." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN WE HAVE AN ISSUE RIGHT THERE. THEN WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. [ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ] AND I'M NOT SURE WHY HE DID THIS. BUT THE OTHER DAY JOHN BOEHNER, HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER POSTED A VIDEO OF HIMSELF ON HIS INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT. AND IT WAS JUST HIM MOWING THE LAWN. [ LAUGHTER ] REAL EXCITING STUFF. CHECK THIS OUT. [ LAWN MOWER STARTING ]
I LOVE GREEN GRASS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHOA, SLOW DOWN, BUSTER. I SAY, WHOA! THAT'S WHAT THE INTERNET WAS MADE FOR, RIGHT THERE. CAN WE SEE THE FIRST PART, CAN WE SEE THAT ONE PART AGAIN REAL QUICK? I LOVE THE FACT -- LOOK AT HIS SNEAKERS. EVERYONE HAS THEIR LAWN-MOWING SNEAKERS.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU KNOW THOSE WHITE SNEAKERS THAT ARE LIKE DYED GREEN AROUND THE THING, BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS -- MY DAD HAD THOSE AS WELL. HE HAD THOSE WHITE SNEAKERS THAT HE WORE ONLY WHEN HE WAS MOWING THE LAWN. THEY WERE TOTALLY DYED GREEN AROUND -- EXCEPT MY DAD DIDN'T DRESS LIKE THAT WHEN HE MOWED THE LAWN. MY DAD WAS SHIRTLESS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN HE WOULD COME BACK. HE'D BE SO HOT, HE WOULD BE SWEATY AND I SWEAR, HALF HIS FACE WAS RED. AND I GO, "DAD, I THINK YOU HAD A STROKE." [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE'S LIKE, "WELL, LAWN'S MOWED." AND THEN POP OPEN A BEER. VERY DIFFERENT GUYS, MY DAD AND JOHN BOEHNER. HEY THIS IS COOL HERE. SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED A A NEW PLANET CALLED "2012 VP," AND THEY ARE NICKNAMING IT "BIDEN." [ LAUGHTER ] NOW JUST IN CASE ANYONE OUT THERE IS CONFUSED, WE WANTED TO POINT OUT SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE NEWLY DISCOVERED PLANET AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IN TONIGHT'S EDITION OF "THIS VERSUS THAT." ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HERE WE GO. THE PLANET IS A FROZEN ROCK 280 MILES IN DIAMETER. JOE BIDEN HAS SEEN "FROZEN" 280 TIMES IN DA THEATER. "DA THEATER."
Steve: DA THEATER?
Jimmy: I REALLY SHOE HORNED THAT PUNCH LINE IN THERE. THE PLANET IS CONSTANTLY IN ORBIT. JOE BIDEN IS CONSTANTLY QUOTING "NORBIT." [ LAUGHTER ] FUNNY MOVIE. "HOW YOU DOIN'?" THE PLANET WAS SPOTTED USING A A TELESCOPE IN CHILE. JOE BIDEN WAS SPOTTED EATING BOTTOMLESS TOSTADA CHIPS AT CHILI'S. [ LAUGHTER ] THE PLANET SPINS AROUND THE SUN AT 4000 MILES PER HOUR. BIDEN CAN SPIN AROUND IN HIS OFFICE CHAIR AT FIVE MILES PER HOUR. [ LAUGHTER ] SEE, THAT'S DANGEROUS.
Steve: YEAH, THAT'S FASTER THAN YOU THINK.
Jimmy: THAT'S DANGEROUS, YEAH. AND FINALLY THE PLANET IS MILLIONS OF MILES AWAY FROM URANUS. JOE BIDEN GIGGLES EVERY TIME HE HEARS THE WORD, "URANUS." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: ME TOO, I DO THE SAME THING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S SOME COOL NEWS, FEDERAL OFFICIALS JUST VOTED TO BOOST THE SPEEDS OF WI-FI NETWORKS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YEAH.

OKAY.
Jimmy: HE WAS VERY VAGUE, AND I GUESS MARVEL DOESN'T WANT HIM TO SAY WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW. HE JUST -- HE KEPT TALKING, AND I HAD TO JUST STOP HIM.
WELL, WE DO HAVE ISSUES WITH THAT, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THEY'LL KILL US.
Jimmy: THEY WILL?
WELL, THEY'LL KILL US OR THEY'LL JUST REPLACE US WITH PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE US AND NOBODY WILL KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT THERE ANYMORE.
Jimmy: AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW --

NOW HE'S AWAKE, AND HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THIS WORLD ALL ABOUT? SO HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE INTERNET. AND HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT TWITTER. AND HE'S TRYING TO GET A DATE BECAUSE HE HASN'T HAD A DATE IN 70 YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH, HE'S FROZEN.
THERE'S THAT. THEN, THERE'S THE FEAR OF MAYBE NOT BEING ABLE TO PERFORM BECAUSE HE IS 90- SOME YEARS OLD. SO HE MIGHT NOT WANT A DATE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT AT ALL. IT'S NOT ABOUT ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION! IT IS NOT!
IT'S SORT OF ABOUT THAT. IT'S SORT OF.
Jimmy: WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
BECAUSE BLACK WIDOW DOES ASK HIM, AT ONE POINT IN THE MOVIE -- IS SHE THE FIRST WOMAN HE'S KISSED IN 45 YEARS. AND HE HAD TO THINK ABOUT THAT? AND THEN, HE DENIES IT. LIKE, "NO, NO, NO. I KISSED SOMEBODY."
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I FORGOT ABOUT THAT. THERE IS A GOOD LITTLE EASTER EGG IN THERE IF YOU'RE A A QUENTIN TARANTINO FAN. I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL ANYTHING.
SCARLET STOLE MY LINE.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S GREAT. YEAH. QUENTIN, IF YOU GO SEE IT. YOU'LL LAUGH. I DON'T WANT TO RUIN IT. ANYWAY, I'VE SAID TOO MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] THE MOVIE IS ABOUT E.D. IT'S A SERIOUS CONDITION.

WITH A FIVE MINUTE BATHROOM BREAK EVERY HOUR, THERE'S NOT A A LOT I WOULDN'T DO, ACTUALLY.
Jimmy: BUT, YOU'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE?
NO, I'VE DONE -- I'VE BEEN IN A CONTEST. I WAS IN A DANCE CONTEST IN A A LITTLE ISLAND OFF THE COAST OF SICILY WHEN I WAS 18. MY BEST FRIEND ENTERED ME IN THE CONTEST. AND I WON THE CONTEST. THERE WERE ABOUT 20 PEOPLE. AS THEY SAID THAT I'D WON, THERE WAS A GAGGLE OF LOCAL -- FIVE LOCAL GIRLS. AND THEY TURNED TOWARDS ME AND THEY JUST KIND OF -- AND DID THIS -- THEY SAID THIS SORT OF STRANGE SICILIAN -- WELL, IT WAS A A CURSE AT ME. AND MY MOTHER WAS LIKE "WELL, IT WAS MALOCCHIO. IT WAS AN EVIL EYE THEY PUT UPON YOU. AND I COULDN'T JUMP IN FRONT OF THE SPELL, SO I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HIT YOU."
Jimmy: WAIT, WHAT IS GOING ON? [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, NO, NO. I'M COMPLETELY --
Jimmy: THIS STORY TOOK SUCH A TURN. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING.
I'M COMPLETELY SERIOUS.
Jimmy: DID YOU JUST PUT THE CURSE ON ME JUST NOW?
NO.
Jimmy: AND YOU POINTED YOUR FINGERS AT ME. WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL RING. LOOK AT THE RING! I MEAN, WHAT? THAT WAS AIMED AT ME SOMEHOW. [ SINGING OFF-KEY ] ♪ LET IT GO, LET IT GO NO, NO ♪ I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. YOU PUT A "FROZEN" CURSE ON ME. SO THEY PUT A CURSE ON YOU?
SO THEY DID THIS THING, THIS SPELL ON ME. AND I'M LIKE, "AH, WHATEVER." SO THE NEXT DAY I'M ON THE BEACH WITH MY LITTLE BROTHER, AND I BREAK MY LEG. THERE'S A ROCK UNDERNEATH THE SAND. IT'S A NICE, EVEN BEACH. I HIT THE ONE ROCK ON THE BEACH, AND I BUST MY ANKLE, MY SHIN BONE, RIPPED THE TENDONS.
Jimmy: AND THIS IS -- YOU WERE ON VACATION?
THIS WAS THE SPELL THAT THESE GIRLS PUT ON ME, THE EVIL EYE. BECAUSE I WON THE DANCE CONTEST, AND I GOT A TROPHY THAT WAS ABOUT AS BIG AS I WAS. AND THEN, I HAD TO BE ON LITTLE SICILIAN CRUTCHES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING -- SICILIAN CRUTCHES? THAT'S NOT A TERM. THAT'S NOT A TERM.
IN SICILY, THEY DON'T HAVE THE -- I'M VERY TALL, AND I WAS LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S PROBABLY HOW YOU WON THE DANCE COMPETITION, TOO. I LIKE IT A LOT. I LIKE TO MOVE IT, MOVE IT. I LIKE TO -- BUT YOU'RE NOT CURSED ANY MORE THOUGH.
APPARENTLY NOT, NO.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, GOOD, YEAH.
I MEAN, NO, I STILL LIKE TO DANCE. BUT I DO IT A LITTLE MORE JUDICIOUSLY NOW THAN I DID.
Jimmy: BECAUSE -- WELL, I'VE GOT TO SAY, "ABOUT A BOY" IS A A GIANT HIT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS SOMEONE FROM NBC. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINING IT TO OUR NETWORK. WE REALLY, REALLY NEEDED IT. I GOT TO SAY --
STOP IT!

I LOVE BOTH OF THEM. I MEAN, I LOVE THEM, AND THEY STAND ALONE. YOU KNOW, A BOOK AND A FILM, THEY --
Jimmy: THEY'RE THEIR OWN THINGS.
THEY ARE. AND THEN, THE TV SHOW IS A A JUMPING OFF POINT. WE TELL THE STORY OF THE MOVIE -- ARE YOU INTERESTED, DARLING. HAVE YOU WATCHED THE SHOW.

Jimmy: HE'S MORE OF A "BOY MEETS WORLD" FAN. [ LAUGHTER ] HE LOVES THAT TYPE OF STUFF. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. "ABOUT A BOY" IS CATCHING UP TO HIM RIGHT NOW. HE'S STILL GOT TIME.
