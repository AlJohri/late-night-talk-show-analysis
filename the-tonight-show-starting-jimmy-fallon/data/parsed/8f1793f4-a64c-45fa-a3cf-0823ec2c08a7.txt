[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HOT CROWD. THIS IS FUN. WELL, HERE'S WHAT -- HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. TOMORROW IS THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION. YEAH. [ AUDIENCE GROANS ] PEOPLE -- [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE FROM ALL ACROSS COUNTRY WILL BE THERE. BUT DON'T WORRY IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT, BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT WILL BE LIVE TWEETING THE WHOLE THING. SO THIS -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LIVE THE WHOLE TIME. ACTUALLY, I READ THAT DONALD TRUMP APPARENTLY WROTE A A DRAFT OF HIS INAUGURATION SPEECH HIMSELF. A LITTLE WORRIED THOUGH, BECAUSE WHILE HE WAS WRITING, HE KEPT YELLING TO HIS SECRETARY, "IS BOOBS SPELLED WITH TWO Os OR THREE?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "BOOOOOOOBS." NOW TRUMP LIKES WRITING EVERYTHING BY HAND AND HE ACTUALLY THREW AWAY SOME LINES FOR HIS SPEECH THAT HE DECIDED NOT TO USE. WELL, WE GOT A HOLD OF SOME OF THEM.
Steve: REALLY? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

EISENHOWER SAID, 'ANY MAN WHO WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT IS EITHER AN EGOMANIAC OR CRAZY' AND TO THAT I SAY, WHY NOT BOTH?" [ APPLAUSE ] SO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HE ENDS UP USING. HE'S VERY EXCITING.
Steve: WIN-WIN.
Jimmy: GET THIS. I READ THAT ONE OF THE DJs AT DONALD TRUMP'S INAUGURATION CELEBRATION USED TO BE HUGH HEFNER'S PERSONAL DJ. YEAH. WHEN ASKED HOW HE BECAME A DJ FOR BOTH HUGH HEFNER AND DONALD TRUMP, HE SAID, "I'M NOT A VERY GOOD DJ." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IF YOU MUST KNOW. AND THIS CONCERNED A FEW PEOPLE HERE.

I READ THAT DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER IVANKA RECENTLY SPOKE WITH MICHELLE OBAMA AND THE CONVERSATION LASTED A WHOLE HOUR. FINALLY MICHELLE WAS LIKE, "OKAY, IVANKA. I'LL BUY THE DAMN PURSE." [ LAUGHTER ] "JUST GIVE IT TO ME. GIVE IT TO ME. GIVE IT TO ME. ALL RIGHT." GUYS LISTEN TO THIS.

Jimmy: DINNER MUSIC, PLEASE. ♪♪ [ LAUGHTER ] THIS ONE IS INSANE, MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] NEVER GO AGAIN! WORST SERVICE. I WENT THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR AND THEY CHARGED ME TWO DRINKS WHEN I ONLY ORDERED ONE HAPPY HOUR DRINK. I ASKED THE BARTENDER, HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE BILL AND ASKED ME TO CALL THE MANAGER LATER SINCE HE'S OUT. I CALLED AND THEY JUST SAID THE MANAGER'S REALLY BUSY AND WILL CALL ME BACK. AS YOU CAN FIGURE, NO CALL AT ALL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ONE STAR! [ LAUGHTER ]
HI, EMMA. FIRST OF ALL, A MANAGER DID CALL YOU BACK. LEFT A MESSAGE, AND YOU CHOSE NOT TO RETURN THAT CALL. WE SPOKE TO BOTH BARTENDERS AND THEY ARE BOTH CONFIDENT YOU DID, IN FACT, HAVE TWO HAPPY HOUR DRINKS. YOU AREN'T HARD TO FORGET CONSIDERING YOU LOST CONTROL OF YOUR BOWELS IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR RESTAURANT, AND -- YOU PROCEEDED TO SIT IN IT FOR THE SIT IN IT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] WE HAD TO RE-ROUTE OUR OTHER PATRONS SO THEY DIDN'T WALK THROUGH YOUR MESS, CAUSING QUITE A SCENE. YOU THEN PROCEEDED TO THROW AWAY YOUR UNDERWEAR IN OUR TRASH CAN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE'D BE HAPPY TO REFUND YOUR ENTIRE BILL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING YOU WILL NEVER RETURN TO ANY OF OUR ESTABLISHMENTS UNTIL YOU ARE POTTY TRAINED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WHAT IN THE -- HOW IS THAT REAL ON ANY LEVEL?
I'VE GOT TO SAY, PRETTY CHILL PLACE TO LET HER GET ANOTHER DRINK AFTER SHE SOILED HERSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN I GET ONE MORE?
Jimmy: WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE.
OKAY.
Jimmy: AND HERE WE GO. THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS. HERE WE GO. ♪♪ ♪♪
Jimmy: WE WALKED INSIDE THIS PLACE TWICE. ONCE WHEN IT WAS A SUSHI BAR AND THEN AGAIN AFTER IT PATHETICALLY PIVOTED TO MEET THE POKE FAD AND IT STUNK ON BOTH VISITS. THE DOOR WAS TOO SPRING-LOADED ON OUR RETURN. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S FIRST OFF. AND THE FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE AT BEST FOR THE STANDARD $11 PLUS TAX. ONE STAR. [ LAUGHTER ]
WE WERE TAKEN ABACK BY YOUR USE OF THE WORD PATHETICALLY IN YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT US PIVOTING OUR BUSINESS MODEL. WHEN YOU MENTIONED THE WORD PATHETICALLY, WE CAN'T HELP BUT VISUALIZE YOU SITTING IN FRONT OF YOUR COMPUTER OR PHONE CRAFTING OVER 7,500 YELP REVIEWS. WE DID SOME QUICK MATH AND BASED ON AVERAGE REVIEW TIME OF EIGHT MINUTES, TO BE CONSERVATIVE, YOU HAVE SPENT AROUND 1,000 HOURS WRITING REVIEWS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NEARLY SIX MONTHS OF A A FULL-TIME 40 HOUR PER WEEK JOB WRITING REVIEWS THAT YOU ARE NOT BEING COMPENSATED FOR OR IMPROVING ANY SORT OF SKILL SET. [ LAUGHTER ] OUR SUGGESTION TO YOU IS TO GET AWAY FROM THIS DARK, DARK RABBIT HOLE YOU HAVE JUMPED DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE SPENT NEARLY SIX MONTHS ADDING ZERO VALUE TO YOUR CAREER. START PUTTING THE SAME EFFORT AND FOCUS ON A CRAFT OR SKILL SET THAT WILL GET YOU AWAY FROM YOUR SOCIAL NETWORK AND START WORKING TOWARDS CAREER GOALS THAT WILL BRING YOU HAPPINESS AND FULFILLMENT, AND BE SURE TO STOP BY NEXT WEEK AND TRY OUR ALL NEW WASABI SHRIMP POKE-BOWL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ RIM SHOT ]
Jimmy: HE'S GONNA STOP BY, BY THE WAY. THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR "DRAMATIC YELP REVIEWS." OUR THANKS TO AZIZ ANSARI. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" THIS WEEK WITH MUSICAL GUEST BIG SEAN! CHECK THAT OUT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH CARRIE BROWNSTEIN, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

YES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AS A CHILD, IN THE SUMMERS, I THINK THIS IS COMMON, PERHAPS, BUT IN THE SUMMERS I WOULD BINGE WATCH THESE SOAPS. "GENERAL HOSPITAL." "YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS."

Jimmy: HOW INTO IT DID YOU GET?
WELL, I MEAN, IF THIS IS ANY INDICATION, I LEARNED SIGN LANGUAGE WHEN PAT AND KAYLA WERE -- [ LAUGHTER ] ON "DAYS OF OUR LIVES" AND KAYLA WENT TEMPORARILY DEAF IN AN ACCIDENT, AND PATCH LEARNED BETTE MIDLER'S "THE ROSE" AND HE SIGNED IT TO HER AND I THEREFORE SIGNED IT TO MY WHOLE FAMILY OVER DINNER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW -- HOW IS IT NOT TOUCHING?
IS IT?
Jimmy: YEAH.

Jimmy: WHAT, WHY?
WELL, BECAUSE I COULD BE DOING SO MANY OTHER THINGS. [ LAUGHTER ]

YEAH, WATCHING SOAPS.
Jimmy: BUT YOU WENT FROM THAT AND THEN HAD TO JUST GET INTO MUSIC? JUST HAD BANDS? DID YOU HAVE OTHER BANDS LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL?
YEAH, WELL, BY THE WAY, I THINK THERE WAS PROBABLY A TIME PERIOD IN BETWEEN SOAP OPERAS AND PLAYING GUITAR. LIKE -- THERE HAS TO HAVE BEEN.
Jimmy: THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF --

THERE'S THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU'RE A KID AND YOU STUMBLE ON SOMETHING YOU'RE LIKE, "THAT'S REALLY PROFOUND." YOU'RE LIKE -- "OH, MY GOD. WE ARE ALL BORN NAKED." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH! THAT'S A REALLY PROFOUND MOMENT. YOU GO OH, MY GOSH!
YEAH, I MEAN --
Jimmy: I THOUGHT OF THAT.
WE SPENT FIVE SECONDS THINKING OF THAT BAND NAME. YEAH.
Jimmy: BORN NAKED.
