IT WAS ABOUT THREE AND A A HALF MILES, THE EPICENTER, FROM OUR HOUSE. SO LITERALLY -- YOU KNOW, IT WAS SHORT. BUT IT WAS PRETTY -- IN FAIRNESS OF THE GUY WHOSE FACE YOU HAVE SHOWN HERE ABOUT 20 TIMES TONIGHT, IT WAS PRETTY -- IT WAS PRETTY VIOLENT SHAKE. THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE EARTHQUAKES TO BEGIN WITH. AND THE ONLY GOOD THING THAT COULD BE SAID ABOUT IT IS THAT IT HIT LITERALLY WITHIN ABOUT 60 SECONDS OF WHEN WE WAKE THE KIDS UP, SO -- [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK MOST OF THE PARENTS WOULD AGREE HERE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN EARTHQUAKE, AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T DESTROY THE HOUSE OR THE STRUCTURE, 6:25 IS PRETTY PRIMO.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S A GOOD TIME. WAKING THE KIDS UP.
THEY HAD A LITTLE SKIP IN THEIR STEP. YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT DID THEY DO? I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE A ROUTINE?
I PROBABLY SHOULD -- I SHOULD PROBABLY SHOULD BE A A LITTLE CALMER. BUT NO, I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A GUY YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS DOING "TALK SOUP" OUT IN CALIFORNIA -- A GUY FROM THE CALIFORNIA SEISMIC INSTITUTE OR SOME PLACE CAME OUT AND TALKED ABOUT THE DANGERS OF EARTHQUAKES, AND PRETTY MUCH TERRIFIED ME. BECAUSE I REMEMBER HIM SAYING THAT IF L.A. WERE A WOMAN, SHE'D BE TEN MONTHS PREGNANT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND --
Jimmy: EW.
YEAH.
Jimmy: IS HIS NAME BUCK KINNEAR?
THAT'S NOT A GOOD VISUAL IS IT?

Jimmy: THAT'S FRIGHTENING.
YEAH, YEAH. BUT IF YOU'RE AT A DANGEROUS JOB -- BECAUSE YOU GOT A LOT OF THIS HAPPENING. SO IF THERE EVER IS AN EARTHQUAKE, HERE'S MY ONLY ADVICE TO YOU. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU CRAWL UNDER THIS DESK.
Jimmy: DON'T DO THAT?
DON'T DO THAT. BECAUSE INVARIABLY THE SHAKING WILL STOP AND YOU WILL HAVE TO DO THAT HORRIBLE -- [ LAUGHTER ] THAT HORRIBLE MOMENT OF LOOKING AROUND.
Jimmy: THAT WOULD BE THE SCARIEST PART THERE? LOOKING AT THE WRECKAGE?
NO. I JUST THINK THAT -- NO, NO, NO. BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOING TO STOP FILMING YOU. CAMERA TWO IS NOT GOING TO STOP FILMING YOU.
Jimmy: I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM.
HE'S GOING TO BE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
