Jimmy: THANK YOU. HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. AW, PLEASE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ HEY, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WELCOME. HELLO. HI, HI, HI EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT IRAQI PRIME MINISTER HAIDER AL ABADI WILL MEET WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA IN APRIL, EVEN THOUGH HAIDER HAS CRITICIZED THE U.S. FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO HELP THE IRAQI MILITARY. WHEN OBAMA HEARD THAT, HE WAS LIKE, "WELL, WHAT YOU GONNA DO, HAIDERS GONNA HAID." [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU GO, "YEAH, I KNOW BUT YOU GOT TO MEET WITH HIM ANYWAY." GET THIS STORY, IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, THE PRESIDENT REVEALED HE DOESN'T ALWAYS GET ENOUGH SLEEP. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE WHEN I SAY, "GOOD." YEAH, THAT'S -- WE PAY YOU MONEY TO DO THAT, SO WE CAN WATCH "DANCING WITH THE STARS" AND GO TO SLEEP. THAT'S WHAT WE PAY YOU -- YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT. YEAH. YEAH. BUMMER, YEAH. BUMMER. YEAH. PRESIDENT OBAMA ADMITTED HE DOESN'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP. DOCTORS SAID THAT HE SHOULD FIND LITTLE TRICKS TO DOZE OFF. YOU KNOW, LIKE MAYBE FOR INSTANCE COUNTING INTRUDERS JUMPING OVER THE WHITE HOUSE FENCE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] JUST STUFF LIKE, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. IT'S LIKE, ENOUGH. THIS IS COOL. I SAW THAT THEY HELD THE FIFTH ANNUAL SCIENCE FAIR AT THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY. I LOVE SCIENCE FAIRS. WERE YOU GOOD AT THAT WHEN YOU WERE --
Steve: NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE NOT?
Steve: NO.
Jimmy: OH, I WAS FANTASTIC, I LOVED THAT STUFF. BUT WHAT, PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHAT HE DOES IS HE MEETS WITH STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY, GOES OVER THEIR SCIENCE PROJECTS, STUFF LIKE THAT. I GOT TO SAY, IT SEEMED LIKE HE KIND OF PHONED THIS ONE IN. THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO GET THROUGH IT AS FAST AS HE COULD, I THINK. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
SO WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING ON?
I DEVELOPED A NANOTECHNOLOGY BASED BIOSENSOR FOR CARDIAC HEALTH DIAGNOSTICS.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
I WANTED TO DEVELOP A DEVICE THAT -- WAS VERY INEXPENSIVE.
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?
WELL, THE TITLE OF MY PROJECT IS LATENCY TACTICS AND PASSWORDS. AUGMENTING PASSWORDS --
LOOKS GOOD TO ME. THIS IS YOUR ROBOT?
THIS IS LAST YEAR'S ROBOT. SO, WE HAD SIX WEEKS TO BUILD THIS SPECIFIC ROBOT LAST YEAR.
ALL RIGHT.
SO, WHAT WE HAVE PRETTY MUCH TO DO -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, I THINK WE -- SOMEONE MESSED WITH THAT. THAT'S NOT A REAL VIDEOTAPE. THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY FOOTAGE.
Steve: THAT SEEMED DOCTORED.
Jimmy: SOMEONE DOCTORED THAT. YEAH, I THINK SO. [ LAUGHTER ] THE BIG POLITICAL STORY RIGHT NOW IS SENATOR TED CRUZ, WHO YESTERDAY BECAME THE FIRST REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. YEAH. AND DURING HIS SPEECH, CRUZ SEEMED REALLY FOCUSED ON GETTING THE CROWD TO USE THEIR IMAGINATIONS. CHECK THIS OUT, WATCH.
IMAGINE A YOUNG MARRIED COUPLE. IMAGINE A TEENAGED BOY. IMAGINE YOUNG PEOPLE. IMAGINE ANOTHER TEENAGE BOY. [ LAUGHTER ] IMAGINE IT'S 1775. IMAGINE IT'S 1776. IMAGINE IT WAS 1777. IMAGINE IT'S 1933. IMAGINE IT'S 1979. IMAGINE IN 2017. IMAGINE. IMAGINE. IMAGINE. THAT WOULD HAVE SEEM UNIMAGINABLE. [ LAUGHTER ]

DURING AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP ACCUSED TED CRUZ AND OTHER CANDIDATES OF STEALING HIS PHRASE "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN." YEP. SAYING HE CAME UP WITH IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO. DONALD TRUMP CAME UP WITH THAT, YEP. HE CAME UP WITH THAT. HE'S SAYING HE CAME UP WITH THAT A YEAR AGO, AND THEN APPARENTLY, HE WENT BACK IN TIME AND GAVE IT TO RONALD REAGAN BECAUSE --
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ]

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I KNOW IT SOUNDS HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT BEFORE "PRETTY WOMAN" CAME OUT, BEING A PROSTITUTE WASN'T CONSIDERED THAT GLAMOROUS. [ LAUGHTER ] DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS OVER THE WEEKEND? A MAN IN NAPLES, ITALY HAND DELIVERED A PIZZA TO POPE FRANCIS WHILE HE WAS RIDING THROUGH THE STREETS IN HIS POPE MOBILE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, A MAN IN ITALY HAND DELIVERED A PIZZA TO THE POPE, WHICH MEANS HE JUST ACHIEVED PEAK ITALIAN. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS JUST FANTASTIC. I MADE A MESS, JUST CRUISE AROUND IN HIS POPE MOBILE. DUDE DELIVERS A PIZZA TO POPE FRANCIS.

IT WILL BECOME THE FIRST SELF-DRIVING CAR TO DRIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EXCITING FOR SCIENTISTS, TERRIFYING FOR THE GUY WHO JUST THOUGHT HE WAS GETTING IN AN UBER. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS LIKE, "WE'RE FAR AWAY FROM MIDTOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS GHOST IS GETTING ZERO STARS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, SOME BUSINESS NEWS HERE, I SAW THAT RADIO SHACK'S ENTIRE INVENTORY WAS PUT UP FOR AUCTION YESTERDAY.

IT'S GREAT. IT'S SO NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY IT. ANYWAY, SO I HAD THIS WOMAN THAT WORKED WITH ME WHEN I WAS A WORK STUDY STUDENT IN COLLEGE. HER NAMED IS DORINDA VANCE. DORINDA VANCE.
Jimmy: YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT THERE.
DORINDA VANCE, SHE LIVES IN PHILADELPHIA. SHE WAS AWESOME, AND -- I LOVE THAT LADY. SHE MADE A REALLY GREAT DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE, REALLY HELPED ME.
Jimmy: WHAT DID SHE DO?
SHE JUST WAS LIKE MY MOM AWAY FROM HOME, YOU KNOW? ALWAYS TOOK CARE OF ME. ALWAYS HAD MY BACK. AND REALLY BELIEVED THAT I WOULD BECOME THE ACTRESS THAT I AM TODAY. AND I THINK EVERYBODY IN MY LIFE THEN WAS SORT OF LIKE, WELL, THAT'S A BIG DREAM. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ON LIKE "THE TONIGHT SHOW" OR SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ] BIG DREAMS THERE, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH, SURE.
SHE WAS LIKE "YEAH, YOU CAN DO IT."
Jimmy: SEE, THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S AWESOME.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?
Jimmy: WELL, IF SHE'S WATCHING -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU TO AMERICAN GREETINGS FOR LETTING ME SAY THAT, AND GO TO THANK LIST AND CREATE YOUR OWN THANK LIST.
Jimmy: THANKLIST.COM. EVERYBODY, ELIZABETH BANKS. COME ON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M THANKFUL FOR YOU FOR COMING ON.
YAY!
Jimmy: COME ON MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE. GO TO THANKLIST.COM. CREATE YOUR OWN THANK LIST. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH RONDA ROUSEY, EVERYBODY. RONDA ROUSEY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST IS CURRENTLY THE REIGNING, UNDEFEATED UFC BANTAMWEIGHT CHAMPION. HER MEMOIR "MY FIGHT, YOUR FIGHT" WILL BE RELEASED MAY 12th. YOU CAN SEE HER DEFEND HER UFC TITLE THIS AUGUST IN BRAZIL AT UFC 190. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME, RONDA ROUSEY! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: RONDA ROUSEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THIS SHOW. YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
THANK YOU. YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH. I APPRECIATE THAT, YEAH. RONDA ROUSEY, THAT'S A GREAT NAME FOR A FIGHTER.
YEAH, IT'S BETTER THAN, LIKE, CRYSTAL LEMMINGS OR SOMETHING.
Jimmy: YEAH, CRYSTAL LEMMINGS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS MY FIRST NAME. THAT'S WHY SHE BROUGHT IT UP. I GREW UP CRYSTAL LEMMINGS AND I CHANGED IT TO JIMMY FALLON. NO, BUT RONDA ROUSEY COULD BE A A RAPPER AS WELL, I GUESS. BUT RONDA ROUSEY, GOOD FIGHTING NAME. WERE YOU A TOUGH KID GROWING UP? DID YOU IN A LOT OF FIGHTS GROWING UP OR NO?
DID I GET INTO A LOT OF FIGHTS? I MEAN, IN MIDDLE SCHOOL, THEY KIND OF PUT ME IN ANGER MANAGEMENT FOR A LITTLE WHILE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT WAS ALL SELF-DEFENSE. I DIDN'T --
Jimmy: KIND OF OR REALLY DID?
THEY REALLY DID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WOW! REALLY? THAT'S MIDDLE SCHOOL, YEAH.
BUT ONCE I STARTED DOING JUDO AND FIGHTING, I DIDN'T FIGHT OUTSIDE SO MUCH. IT REALLY TOOK ALL THE AGGRESSION OUT. I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING LEFT OVER. I'M PRETTY TIRED AT THE END OF THE DAY.
Jimmy: YEAH. AND YOU TOOK JUDO JUST BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT, I NEED TO DO SOMETHING. I NEED TO GET THE ENERGY OUT SOMEHOW.
WELL, MY MOM WON THE FIRST AMERICAN EVER TO WIN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IN JUDO.
Jimmy: IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH, SHE IS FIRST EVER. AND WHEN WE MOVED BACK TO L.A., SHE TOOK ME TO ALL HER OLD CLUBS AND I TRIED IT. I HAD NO HAIR TIE IN. MY HAIR WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. IT WAS CRAZY. I JUST LOVED IT SO MUCH.
Jimmy: YOU'RE JUST LIKE A A BALL OF HAIR THAT WOULD FLIP AROUND AND KILL PEOPLE?
SIX YEARS LATER, I WAS ON AN OLYMPIC TEAM LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH. I MEAN, JUDO IS THE ART OF SELF-DEFENSE WHERE YOU USE OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTIONS TO KIND OF PUSH THEM OUT OF THE WAY, RIGHT?
MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY AND MINIMUM EFFORT ARE MY TWO PRINCIPLES.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT I MEANT TO SAY. [ LAUGHTER ] MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY, MINIMUM EFFORT. YOU JUST STAND THERE AND PEOPLE COME AT YOU LIKE AND YOU'RE LIKE, "LET'S GO." AND YOU FLIP THEM OUT OF THE WAY.
THE BIGGER AND STRONGER THEY ARE, THE BETTER IT IS. IT'S LIKE DOUBLE JUMPING ON A A TRAMPOLINE ALMOST.
Jimmy: REALLY? AND SO, YOU JUST GOT INTO THAT AND THEN -- SO, WHERE DID YOU THINK YOUR CAREER WAS GOING TO TAKE YOU TO? I MEAN, YOU WENT TO THE OLYMPICS.
YEAH, I WENT TO TWO OLYMPICS. I WAS THE FIRST AMERICAN WOMAN TO WIN A MEDAL IN JUDO.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOT TOO SHABBY RIGHT THERE, PAL!
BUT THERE'S NO JOB PLACEMENT FOR OLYMPIANS. THERE'S NO SCHOLARSHIPS, SO THEN AFTER THE OLYMPICS, I WAS LIKE WELL, I CAN'T PUT --
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU DO?
YEAH, I CAN'T PUT A RESUME I'M GOOD AT THROWING PEOPLE AND BREAKING THEIR ARMS.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET BOOKED AT MANY HIGH SCHOOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
I GOT A COCKTAIL WAITRESSING JOB IN CRENSHAW, BUT THAT'S THE ONLY THING. THAT'S THE ONLY JOB JUDO EVER HELPED ME GET.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH. YEAH, BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO MESS WITH YOU, YOU'LL JUST FLIP THEM OUT OF THE PLACE. ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH.
Jimmy: SO, WAS YOUR MOM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT? YOU GETTING INTO MMA?
WELL, MMA, NO. AT FIRST SHE'S -- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SWEAR.
Jimmy: NO.
THAT WAS HER FIRST INCLINATION. IT INVOLVED A LOT OF SWEAR WORDS.
Jimmy: YEAH, OH, YEAH.
MAKING IT CLEANER SHE SAID, "THAT'S THE STUPIDEST IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE AND CONSIDERING THE IDEAS YOU'VE HAD, THAT'S PRETTY BAD."
Jimmy: WOW. THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT, MOM. I MEAN, LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE. I MEAN, THIS IS -- WHAT YOU DO IS IT'S JUST MIND BOGGLING FOR ME TO WATCH. JUST GETTING IN THERE, IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE NOT YOU. YOU'RE NOT THIS PERSON BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST THE NICEST PERSON BACKSTAGE. YOU LOOK SO NICE AND PRETTY AND CHARMING. AND THEN, I SEE YOU IN THE RING, AND YOU JUST, IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE.
IT'S LIKE A FRACTION OF YOUR PERSONALITY. I'M LIKE COMPLETELY EMOTIONLESS WHEN I'M IN THERE. PEOPLE THINK I'M MAD, BUT LIKE, I'M ONLY OBSERVING. I'M ENTIRELY IN THE PRESENT. THERE'S NO FIVE MINUTES AGO OR FIVE MINUTES FROM NOW. IT'S JUST EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MOMENT. I DON'T KNOW OPINIONS. I DON'T KNOW EMOTIONS. IT'S JUST OBSERVATIONS AND DECISIONS, THAT'S IT.
Jimmy: YOU'RE JUST THAT FOCUSED.
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU JUST GET IN THERE AND YOU -- I MEAN, ROWDY RONDA ROUSEY IS WHAT THEY CALL YOU, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. I WAS THINKING YOU COULD BE RONDA DROWSY, RONDA ROUSEY. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, COME IN. YOU'RE LIKE -- AND THEN POW. THEN, YOU SURPRISE HER WITH A A SNEAKY, THE PILLOW PUNCH!
I MIGHT DO THAT IN BRAZIL.
Jimmy: GIVE SOMEONE THE PILLOW PUNCH AND THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. I JUST CAME UP WITH THAT. YOU CAN TRADEMARK IT. YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT.
YOU CAN KEEP IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, WE'LL NEVER HEAR IT EVER AGAIN. YOU WERE JUST IN ALBANY. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT -- IS IT NOT LEGAL TO DO IN NEW YORK?
WELL, THEY HAVE AMATEUR MMA IN NEW YORK, BUT THERE'S NO ATHLETIC COMMISSION TO OVERSEE IT. SO, EVERYONE THAT COMPETES THERE -- THERE'S 1600 NEW YORKERS THAT FOUGHT AMATEUR LAST YEAR WITH NO MEDICAL TESTING, NO DRUG TESTING. AND THE REFEREES AREN'T EDUCATED. IT'S THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE TO DO MMA.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
I KNOW. WE NEED TO HAVE AN ATHLETIC COMMISSION TO OVERSEE IT.
Jimmy: THERE'S PEOPLE THAT WANT YOU TO STOP DOING IT, RIGHT?
YEAH, AND THEY'RE LIKE MAKING THESE CRAZY ARGUMENTS THAT IT'S ANTI- WOMAN. THIS IS THE MOST PRO-WOMAN SPORT IN THE WORLD. I'M THE NUMBER ONE DRAW IN ALL THE UFC AND I'M A WOMAN. FIGHTING ISN'T A MAN'S THING. IT'S A HUMAN THING. TO SAY IT'S ANTI-WOMAN IS ANTI-FEMINIST.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO, HEY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. QUESTLOVE SAID SOMETHING. HE WAS THE ONE TALKING ABOUT IT.
Questlove: NO, NO, NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WAS JUST TRYING TO SAY I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. HE WAS TALKING BIG BACKSTAGE.
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT ALL DAY. SORRY, I'M ALL AMPED UP.
Jimmy: YOU WERE JUST IN ALBANY?
I LITERALLY DROVE STRAIGHT FROM THERE TO HERE.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND YOU TALKED TO GOVERNOR CUOMO?
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND JUST TRIED TO GET HIM TO SAY, HEY, YOU HAVE TO FLIP THIS AROUND. YOU GOT TO TURN THIS THING AROUND. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS LEGAL.
HE SEEMED SUPER POSITIVE ABOUT IT AND REALLY SUPPORTIVE, SO.
Jimmy: LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN.
I REALLY HOPE THIS IS THE YEAR.
Jimmy: WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCH OUR SHOW. WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN. IF GOVERNOR CUOMO'S WATCHING OUR SHOW, MAKE IT HAPPEN. LET'S DO THIS.
WRITE YOUR ASSEMBLYMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH, THEN YOU CAN HAVE A UFC. MAKE IT LEGAL. IT WILL BE SAFER FOR EVERYBODY. BUT YOU GO OUT THERE AND THERE'S A THING THEY ALSO CALL YOU. I'M GOING TO SAY THAT I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT YOU WHEN I SAY THIS, BUT THEY CALL YOU THE ARM COLLECTOR. BECAUSE YOU ALMOST SNAP PEOPLE'S ARMS IN HALF WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING THEM.
WELL, NOT ALWAYS ALMOST.
Jimmy: ALMOST ALWAYS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I MEAN, ALMOST, IF THEY DON'T SAY THE RIGHT WORD, THEIR ARM IS GETTING BROKEN.
IF THEY SAY ANYTHING, IT'S CALLED A VERBAL SUBMISSION. SO, YOU CAN HAVE ANY SAFETY WORD YOU WANT.
Jimmy: YEAH. CAN YOU SHOW ME SAFELY WHAT THE ARM -- BECAUSE YOU DO LIKE A, WHAT IS IT CALLED? THE ARM BAR?
WELL, IN JUDO IT'S CALLED JUJI KATAME.
Jimmy: OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ]
GIVE ME YOUR ARM AND I'LL SHOW YOU.
Jimmy: THAT'S OBVIOUS. YEAH, I KNEW THAT, JUJI KATAME.
MY MOM TAUGHT IT TO ME.
Jimmy: YOUR MOM TAUGHT YOU. SO, IT'S THE JUJI KATAME.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME YOUR ARM.
Jimmy: I WILL. BUT I NEED A SAFE WORD. [ LAUGHTER ] A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MY WITNESSES HERE, YEAH. IF I SAY "PINEAPPLE" OR "RUMPELSTILTSKIN."
WE GOT TO PICK ONE. I'M GOING TO GET CONFUSED IF YOU DON'T COMMIT.
Jimmy: "RUMPELSTILTSKIN."
OKAY, GOT IT. OKAY, READY?
Jimmy: NO! [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, WAIT. YOU'RE GOING A LITTLE BIT TOO FAST. TAKE YOUR TIME AND JUST SHOW ME THE IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENS. WE'RE FIGHTING EACH OTHER.
SO, YOU HAVE THE PERSON'S ARM. AND YOUR ARM DOESN'T GO BEYOND 180 DEGREES, RIGHT? AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A LOT OF PRESSURE. YOU JUST PUSH IT RIGHT AT THE ELBOW.
Jimmy: RUMPY, RUMPY, YEAH.
WHAT? [ LAUGHTER ] RUMPY, WHAT?
Jimmy: RUMPELSTILTSKIN! RUMPELSTILTSKIN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OW. THAT WAS SCARY. THAT'S LIKE PUTTING YOUR HEAD IN THE LION'S MOUTH RIGHT THERE. WOW, THAT WAS INTENSE FOR ME. WE LOVE YOU, PAL, AND BEST OF LUCK. WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.
