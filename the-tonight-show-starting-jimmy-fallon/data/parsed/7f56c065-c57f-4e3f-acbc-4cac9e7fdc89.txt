ONE GUY JUMPED OVER THE FENCE, THE WHITE HOUSE FENCE. ANOTHER GUY ACTUALLY GOT THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OFFICIALS ARE WONDERING WHY IT'S SO EASY TO GET IN WHILE OBAMA'S WONDERING WHY IT'S SO HARD TO GET OUT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "-- GET ME OUTTA HERE!" MORE BAD NEWS FOR THE PRESIDENT. CHICAGO IS REVERSING ITS PLAN TO NAME A HIGH SCHOOL AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA. BECAUSE IT RECEIVED MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY. I GUESS -- I GUESS PARENTS ARE AFRAID THEIR KIDS WOULD SPEND 8 YEARS AT THE SCHOOL AND STILL NOT GET ANYTHING DONE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THAT'S NOT -- THAT'S NOT A GUARANTEE. JUST THE NAME OF THE HIGH SCHOOL. THAT'S RIGHT. CHICAGO'S REVERSING ITS PLAN TO NAME A HIGH SCHOOL AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA. THEY'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE FINAL NAME WILL BE, BUT THEY FELT WITH A NAME WILL BE MORE POPULAR THAN BARACK OBAMA HIGH SCHOOL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. BARACK "2008 VERSION" OBAMA HIGH SCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S CLUNKY -- IT'S CLUNKY BUT IT'S MORE POPULAR. I'M HAPPY I'M NOT INVOLVED.

[ APPLAUSE ] SOME SAD NEWS, YOU GUYS. I HOPE YOU'RE SITTING DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] FROM THE WORLD OF REALITY TV. MAMA JUNE AND SUGAR BEAR FROM "HERE COMES HONEY BOO BOO" ARE SPLITTING UP. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] THEIR LAWYERS ARE CITING UNINTELLIGIBLE DIFFERENCES. [ LAUGHTER ] [ GIBBERISH ] AND YOU KNOW THAT. [ GIBBERISH ] GUYS, GUYS, NOT IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN. GET THIS, YOU GUYS, THERE ARE REPORTS THAT POPE FRANCIS IS TRYING TO UPDATE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S POLICIES SO THAT IT'S EASIER FOR COUPLES TO GET A A DIVORCE. WHEN PEOPLE ASKED WHY, THE POPE WAS LIKE, "SHE KNOWS WHY -- I MEAN, NOTHING." [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, ONE OF THE BIG SPORTS STORIES RIGHT NOW IS DEREK JETER'S FINAL FEW HOME GAMES AS A YANKEE. AND WHENEVER HE HITS A FOUL BALL INTO THE STANDS, IT'S PRETTY VALUABLE. IF YOU CATCH ONE OF THESE GUYS.

SO I MADE LIKE A MIX OF EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: HOW WOULD YOU DO? DO YOU GO INTO THE LAB OR DO YOU TEST THEM OUT? DO YOU WEAR THEM?

Jimmy: YEAH YOU'RE LIKE "BENJAMIN BUTTON."
LIKE, ACTRESS. LEADING THE ANTI-AGIST MOVEMENT! NO ONE'S TAKING ME SERIOUSLY!
Jimmy: NO, NO. BUT YOU STARTED -- WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE COMMUNITY? THE VILLAGES?
YES. YEAH.
Jimmy: AND WHERE IS THAT?
CENTRAL FLORIDA.
Jimmy: HOW COOL IS THAT?
YEAH.
Jimmy: SO WHAT'S THE ADVANTAGES OF GROWING UP IN A A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY? I WOULD LOVE TO DO THIS.
I'M REALLY GOOD AT SHUFFLEBOARD.
Jimmy: YEAH! ABSOLUTELY. [ LAUGHTER ]
I COULD BASICALLY HAVE GONE INTO IT PROFESSIONALLY. BUT I FOUND SOMETHING ELSE.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S A A FANTASTIC GAME. I LOVE SHUFFLEBOARD. IT'S SO GOOD. ANY TIPS? JUST GO FOR THE FRONT ONES FIRST?
IT'S KIND OF LIKE BOWLING BUT JUST DIFFERENT --
Jimmy: I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. [ LAUGHTER ]
-- HAND POSITIONS.
Jimmy: DIFFERENT HAND POSITIONS, YEAH. AND YOU DON'T PICK UP A HEAVY BALL AND THROW IT INTO PINS. YOU SHUFFLE A LITTLE PUCK IN THE END.
THAT'S THE BEST WAY I KNOW HOW I DESCRIBE IT TO YOUNG PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, I LOVE IT. I THINK IT'S THE BEST THING EVER, MAN. THEY MUST HAVE BEEN FREAKING OUT AT THE VILLAGES WHEN THEY SAW THIS ON "JEOPARDY!" YOU'RE A CLUE ON "JEOPARDY!"
I KNOW!
Jimmy: COME ON! THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
THAT'S MY NAME IN THAT ICONIC LETTERING.
Jimmy: ISN'T THAT COOL?
I MEAN --
Jimmy: ALEX TREBEK! HE SAID YOUR NAME.
HE SAID MY NAME.
Jimmy: YEAH. HE MUST BE LIKE THE MAN AT THE VILLAGES.
HE'S THE MAN EVERYWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I GOT TO THANK YOU FOR THE "BLACK LIST" BECAUSE, IF YOUR SHOW DOES REALLY WELL, WE DO REALLY WELL.
OH, JIMMY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S VERY SELFISH, BUT YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NO! WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, BUT CONGRATULATIONS. IT'S A GIANT HIT AT NBC, AND EVERYONE IS FREAKING OUT. I MEAN, YOUR PICTURE IS ALL OVER NEW YORK CITY. ALL OVER ALL THE SUBWAYS. YOU AND JAMES SPADER. THE WHOLE THING, IT'S JUST VERY EXCITING FOR US.
OH, WELL, IT'S EXCITING BECAUSE BOTH OUR SHOWS CAME ON THE SAME YEAR.
Jimmy: AND WE'RE DOING WELL.
WE'RE DOING GOOD.
Jimmy: YEAH, WE ARE DOING GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I MEAN, EVERY TIME I TALK TO YOU, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THE SHOW AT ALL.
NO, I'M NOT.
Jimmy: SO I GO -- [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T GET SERIOUS ON ME THOUGH, MEGAN. YOU WERE JUST LAUGHING. WE'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME.
YOUR CHARMS DON'T WORK ON ME, JIMMY.
Jimmy: I'M NOT TRYING TO CHARM IT OUT OF YOU, BUT --
YEAH, YOU ARE.
Jimmy: NO, I'M NOT.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. YOU'RE SO CHARMING, AND EVERYONE TELLS YOU EVERYTHING.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. EVERYONE KNOWS YOU'RE JAMES SPADER'S DAUGHTER ON THE SHOW, AND -- [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT HAPPENED?
I JUST HAVE SOMETHING IN MY THROAT. JIMMY, I CAN'T TALK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD. PLEASE, BUT YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE THING.
CAN'T GET IT OUT. CAN'T GET OUT OF MY THROAT.
Jimmy: MEGAN. MEGAN, I NEED -- CAN I HELP YOU? [ LAUGHTER ]
OH, THANKS. I'M GOOD NOW. I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD. CAN YOU SAY WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THIS SEASON'S "BLACK LIST," ANYTHING?
I GOT THIS CUT ON MY HAND? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO REVEAL ANYTHING. LIKE, I HEARD SOME INSIDE STUFF.
WELL, OKAY.
Jimmy: I CAN TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON.
I KNOW THAT PAUL REUBENS IS COMING ON OUR SHOW.
Jimmy: PEE-WEE HERMAN HIMSELF.

THAT'S REALLY GREAT!
Jimmy: NO, BUT HE'S DOING A A DIFFERENT CHARACTER. HE'S A VILLAIN.
YEAH. LET ME PAINT A PICTURE FOR YOU.
Jimmy: OKAY. HE'S A GREAT ACTOR.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I LIKE HIM.
PAUL REUBENS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
JAMES SPADER.
Jimmy: HM-HMM. THAT'S THE PICTURE? [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU LEFT A LOT OPEN THERE. A VERY ABSTRACT PAINTING. SO WAIT, WE'RE GOING TO SHOW A A CLIP. SO IS THIS CLIP FROM THE SHOW THAT AIRED EARLIER?
NO, THIS IS A CLIP THAT NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN. IT'S COMING ON IN A WEEK.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT, GOOD. YOU GUYS HAVE TO WATCH "THE BLACKLIST." YOU HAVE TO WATCH MEGAN BOONE. SHE'S AWESOME. HERE'S A CLIP. IT'S A SNEAK PEEK OF MEGAN BOONE IN NEXT WEEK'S EPISODE OF "THE BLACKLIST." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
