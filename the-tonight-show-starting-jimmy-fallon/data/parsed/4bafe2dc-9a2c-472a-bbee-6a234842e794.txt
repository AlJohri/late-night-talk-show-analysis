Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! THAT'S A NEW YORK CITY CROWD RIGHT THERE. HEY, NEW YORK. WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." HERE WE ARE. WE ALL READY HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, HISTORY WAS MADE ON SATURDAY WHEN AMERICAN PHARAOH BECAME THE FIRST HORSE SINCE 1978 TO WIN THE TRIPLE CROWN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THE STANLEY CUP, AND THE NBA FINALS, AND THE FRENCH OPEN, AND SOMEHOW THE NICKELODEON KIDS CHOICE AWARD. I DON'T KNOW HOW -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S AN AMAZING HORSE. THAT'S RIGHT, AMERICAN PHARAOH EASILY WON THE BELMONT STAKES TO WIN THE TRIPLE CROWN. THE BAD NEWS, HE FORGOT TO WEAR HIS FITBIT TO SEE HOW MANY CALORIES HE BURNED. [ LAUGHTER ] I HATE WHEN I DO THAT, BECAUSE I KNOW I PUT THE STEPS IN. I JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF. [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T REACH MY STEP GOAL. I KNOW.
Steve: YOU RAN A RACE.
Jimmy: YOU SAW ME RACE?
Steve: YEAH, I KNOW. BUT YOU CAN'T LOAD IT IN LATER.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] AMERICAN PHARAOH IS THE FIRST HORSE SINCE 1978 TO WIN THE TRIPLE CROWN OR AS HIS BROTHER, WHO PULLS THE CARRIAGE IN CENTRAL PARK PUT IT, "OH, GREAT ANOTHER PROUD MOMENT FOR PHARAOH. WHOOP-DE-DOO. [ LAUGHTER ] TAVERN ON THE GREEN, COMIN' UP, LET'S GO." [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS ACTUALLY A BIG WEEKEND FOR SPORTS. LAST NIGHT, THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS BEAT THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS IN OVERTIME TO TIE THE NBA FINALS AT ONE GAME A PIECE. [ CHEERS ] [ BOOS ] LeBRON, LeBRON SAID IT WAS A A HUGE WIN, AND HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT THE BALL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE NBA FINALS ARE NOW TIED UP AT 1-1, AND THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT SO FAR, WITH BOTH GAMES COMING DOWN TO THE WIRE, EXTENDING TO OVERTIME. BOTH GAMES. BUT THE EXTRA MINUTES ARE REALLY TAKING A TOLL ON THE PLAYERS. CHECK OUT WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. CLEVELAND'S LeBRON JAMES SAID, "I'M EXHAUSTED, BUT THIS IS THE FINALS. IT TAKES EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT." GOLDEN STATE'S STEPH CURRY SAID, "I'M LEAVING IT ALL OUT IN THE COURT. BUT I'LL RECOVER FOR THE NEXT GAME." FINALLY REFEREE BILL DOYLE SAID, "ONE MORE OVERTIME, I'M EJECTING MYSELF." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] IS THAT POSSIBLE? CAN HE DO THAT? AND THIS IS NOT GOOD. ON SATURDAY, TIGER WOODS HAD A A ROUGH TIME AT THE MEMORIAL TOURNAMENT IN OHIO, WHERE HE SHOT AN 85, WHICH WAS HIS WORST ROUND EVER. WHAT MOST PEOPLE WHO PLAY GOLF WOULD HAPPILY CALL "MY BEST ROUND EVER." [ LAUGHTER ] SHOT AN 85, DUDE. THIS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WERE THE FINALS OF THE FRENCH OPEN IN PARIS. SO IN HONOR OF THE GAMES, WE WANTED TO CELEBRATE THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW HOW -- SETTING THE BEST TENNIS GRUNTS FROM THIS YEAR'S OPEN TO MUSIC. ENJOY.

RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL. YOU CAN TELL THE AFTER PARTY GOT OUT OF HAND, BECAUSE THIS MORNING I SAW SOMEONE DOING THE TAP-DANCE OF SHAME. [ TAPPING ] HEY, NOT AS FUNNY AS IT WAS IN REHEARSAL. IT'S FINE. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T WORRY. IT HAPPENS.
Steve: YOU TRIED. YOU TRIED.
Jimmy: IT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: IT HAPPENS TO THE BEST. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT A GAMBLE.
Jimmy: TAP-DANCE OF SHAME, THEY WERE DOING. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO ENJOY IT.
Steve: NO, THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT. THEY LIKED THE TONY AWARDS.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE EVERYTHING. NO, THE GRUNTS WERE GREAT.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: WE PEAKED, WE PEAKED AT THE GRUNTING AND THEN I TRIED TO DO THE TAP-DANCE OF SHAME.
Steve: DID NOT WORK.
Jimmy: IT DIDN'T WORK. [ TAPPING ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S GET TO SOME POLITICAL NEWS HERE. THIS WEEKEND, SEVEN GOP HOPEFULS INCLUDING RICK PERRY, MARCO RUBIO, AND LINDSEY GRAHAM ATTENDED THE ROAST AND RIDE FUND RAISER HOSTED BY IOWA SENATOR, JONI ERNST. YOU REMEMBER JONI ERNST, RIGHT?
I'M JONI ERNST. I GREW UP CASTRATING HOGS ON AN IOWA FARM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: PEOPLE AT THE BARBECUE ARE LIKE, "TAKE IT FROM ME, DON'T EAT THE MEATBALLS." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU WON'T LIKE THEM. [ APPLAUSE ] IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY CRITICIZED PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYING, QUOTE, "I'VE TRIED FOR A LONG TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES HIM TICK AND FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW." WHICH IS USUALLY WHAT CHENEY HEARS FROM HIS CARDIOLOGIST. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I'M NOT HEARING ANYTHING. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS. DURING THE WORLDWIDE DEVELOPERS' CONFERENCE TODAY, APPLE DEBUTED ITS OWN MUSIC STREAMING SERVICE CALLED APPLE MUSIC. AND WITH THESE FORMULAS THEY DO, THEY CAN DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF PERSON YOU ARE BASED ON WHAT KIND OF MUSIC YOU SEARCH FOR. I'LL SHOW WHAT I MEAN. IF YOU SEARCH FOR MUSIC BY KANYE WEST, DUETS WITH KANYE WEST, AND SONGS PRODUCED BY KANYE WEST, THEY DETERMINE YOU'RE KANYE WEST. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] INTERESTING FORMULA. THEY WORK IT ALL OUT. IF YOU SEARCH FOR "THE MACARENA" AND "WHO LET THE DOGS OUT," THEY DETERMINE YOU'VE BEEN HELD HOSTAGE AT A WEDDING SINCE 1994. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: WHO? WHO? WHO? WHO?
Jimmy: FINALLY, IF YOU SEARCH FOR BUCK CHERRY, THEY DETERMINE YOU'RE EITHER A A BUCK CHERRY FAN OR A DYSLEXIC CHUCK BERRY FAN. [ LAUGHTER ]

WE'RE LIKE CLARK KENT AND SUPERMAN. WE CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT.
Jimmy: IT REALLY IS.
AND WE'RE NOT FRIENDS. SO WHY WOULD YOU BE TOGETHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I REALLY DIDN'T EVER SEE YOU AND IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER. I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF YOU DIDN'T EXIST.
YEAH.
Jimmy: BUT I SAW YOU PRESENTING ON THE TONYS LAST NIGHT. THAT WAS FANTASTIC.
HOW GOOD WAS HE? COME ON.
Jimmy: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NOT ONE PERSON HERE WATCHED THE SHOW.
NO.
NOT ONE.
AND IF I WASN'T PRESENTING, I WOULDN'T HAVE WATCHED EITHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
OH NO, THAT'S 100% TRUE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU NEVER WATCHED THE TONY AWARDS?
NEVER, NEVER.
Jimmy: ANY AWARD SHOWS? DO YOU WATCH AWARD SHOWS?
NO.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T. NO.
NO.
Jimmy: NO NEED. NO INTEREST IN THAT.
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE --
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU'LL FIND OUT THE NEXT DAY.
IT'S A LITTLE HUMORLESS, ISN'T IT?
Jimmy: NO, IT'S FUN. BUT HERE YOU ARE, YOU'RE ON BROADWAY. YOU'RE SHATTERING RECORDS.
SHATTERING. [ LAUGHTER ] I LIKE THAT WORD.
Jimmy: THAT'S A GOOD A WORD, RIGHT?
THAT'S A GOOD WORD, JIM.
Jimmy: DON'T EVER PLAY SCRABBLE WITH ME.
YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED WHEN I HEARD THAT COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED.
Jimmy: A LITTLE BIT. YEAH, YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT HAPPENING. YEAH, IT'S AN ADVANCED WORD. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU REALLY DID. YOU BROKE ALL BOX OFFICE RECORDS. THE THEATRE -- THE CORT THEATRE RECORDS FOR THIS PLAY.
YEAH IT DID. WE DID QUITE WELL. YES. [ LAUGHTER ] QUITE WELL.
Jimmy: YOU CHANGED. YOU CHANGED. YOU'VE NEVER TALKED LIKE THAT.
I'M A SHADOW OF MY FORMER SELF. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BUT MAN, OH, MAN, DID YOU DO IT, OH MY GOSH.
IT'S BROADWAY LARRY.
Jimmy: IT'S BROADWAY LARRY. YEAH.
I NEVER SAW YOU BACKSTAGE.
OH. [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: I DON'T DO BACKSTAGE.
GO HEAD.
YOU DON'T DO BACKSTAGE?
I DON'T THINK YOU DID FRONT STAGE!
YOU WOULDN'T GO BACK -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M A VERY BUSY MAN.
OH, YOU'RE A BUSY GUY? I KNOW, I KNOW, YOU'RE BUSY.
Jimmy: HEY YOU -- WELL, I MEAN, I'M RIGHT DOWN THE STREET. YOU DIDN'T GET TO HERE.
BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT WATCHING THIS THING EVERY NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I STEPPED ON IT. I STEPPED ON IT. [ APPLAUSE ] OH, MY GOSH. I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU ENJOY THE BACKSTAGE? HERE'S WHY I DON'T LIKE GOING BACKSTAGE AT PLAYS. BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU PERFORMED FOR TWO HOURS FOR ME.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND NOW I'VE GOT TO GO BACKSTAGE AND THEY'VE GOT TO PERFORM FOR ME MORE? THAT'S LIKE WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?
THE ONLY PART WITH BACKSTAGE IS WHEN YOU'RE A FRIEND WITH SOMEBODY IN THE CAST AND IT HASN'T GONE WELL. THAT'S THEN -- THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO YOU WERE -- YOU WERE! YOU WERE! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT WAS.
IT WAS. THAT'S ALL. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: BUT I FEEL BAD. LIKE, IF I CAME TO SEE YOUR -- I WAS WAITING FOR --
IT'S UNLIKELY NOW.
Jimmy: I WAS WAITING FOR JASON.
'CAUSE HE'S GONE. YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: I WAS WAITING FOR THE REAL STAR TO BE IN THE PLAY. [ LAUGHTER ] HELLO, THE GUY WHO WAS TONY AWARD WINNING.
YEAH.
OH, YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S A DIFFERENCE, YEAH. BUT IF I CAME TO SEE THE PLAY, WOULD YOU WANT ME TO COME BACKSTAGE?
UH -- YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO COME BACKSTAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S --
Jimmy: THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO HEAR. THAT'S ALL I NEEDED.
HERE'S HOW I WOULD THINK. I WOULD GO, "OH, JIMMY DIDN'T LIKE ME IN THE SHOW."
Jimmy: OH, REALLY?
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH NOT GOING BACK. BECAUSE I'M VERY SHY, I DON'T LIKE TO GO BACK. ESPECIALLY IF I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY, 'CAUSE I'M VERY SHY ABOUT IT. BUT THEN THEY GO, "OH, I GUESS HE DIDN'T LIKE THE SHOW."
Jimmy: OH, I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU'RE EXHAUSTED. ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO THE SHOW ANYMORE NOW AND COACH, OR LOOK FROM THE SIDELINES LIKE A A THEATRE MOM?
I'M GOING TO GO TOMORROW NIGHT.
YEAH.
I'M GOING TO GO TOMORROW NIGHT TO SEE. FINALLY GET A CHANCE TO ENJOY IT.
Jimmy: AND ARE YOU GOING TO BE LIP SYNCING THE WORDS AS HE'S SAYING IT, GOING, "I COULD HAVE DONE THAT BETTER?"
OH, NO, I WOULD NEVER DO THAT, BUT --
Jimmy: BUT YOU GOING TO BE LIP SYNCING THE WORDS BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID IT NOW FOR HOW LONG? EIGHT SHOWS A WEEK?
18 WEEKS. YEAH.
Jimmy: A LITTLE CRAZY, RIGHT? LIKE THAT'S WHERE --
HE'S NEVER DONE THAT IN HIS LIFE. I MEAN, TO REPEAT MATERIAL TWICE LET ALONE EIGHT TIMES A A WEEK, 18 WEEKS.
Jimmy: WHY WOULD YOU EVEN DO THIS? I CAN'T SEE YOU DOING THIS.
I'M SAYING THE EXACT THING NOW I SAID THE LAST TIME I WAS ON YOUR SHOW.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I'M REPEATING THAT.
Jimmy: WELL, I DON'T REMEMBER THAT EPISODE, I'M SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, YEAH, YEAH. EXACTLY. AND YOU STILL, AFTERWARD, DID YOU GIVE HIM ANY ADVICE OR ANYTHING? 'CAUSE HE'D BEEN ON --
I GAVE HIM ADVICE BEFORE HE DID THE SHOW.
Jimmy: WHAT KIND OF ADVICE?
HE DIDN'T TELL ME NOT TO DO IT!
YOU DIDN'T ASK! [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID DON'T DO IT!
YOU HAD ALREADY SIGNED YOUR OWN STUPID SHOW THEN YOU SAID, "I'M DOING IT." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO WALK HIM THROUGH, LIKE, THERE'S A THING THAT HAPPENS IN REHEARSALS. YOU REHEARSE FOR THREE TO FIVE WEEKS.
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
I SAID TO HIM, "EVERYTHING IS GOING TO GO GREAT WEEK ONE, EVERYTHING'S GONNA GO GREAT WEEK TWO, AND WEEK THREE IT'S GONNA FALL APART, AND YOU'RE GONNA PANIC." HE GOES, "WELL, WHY'S IT FALL APART?" I SAID, "NOBODY KNOWS. IT ALWAYS DOES." IT FALLS APART IN WEEK THREE, THEN IT COMES BACK IN WEEK FOUR. I ALSO SAID, "YOU'RE GONNA OPEN, YOU'RE GONNA BE FUN, PREVIEWS -- GONNA HAVE FUN. OPENING NIGHT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FUN. ABOUT THREE WEEKS AFTER YOU OPEN, I'LL CALL YOU ON ABOUT 4:00 ON A THURSDAY, UST ABOUT THREE HOURS BEFORE YOU GO TO THE THEATRE, AND YOU'LL WANT TO PUT YOUR OWN EYES OUT BEFORE YOU'RE BACK." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU'RE LIKE, "WHY AM I DOING THIS?"
YEAH. AND, YOU KNOW -- BUT HE DID VERY WELL. YOU DID VERY WELL.
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ]
YES, YOU DID VERY WELL.
THRONGS WAITING AT THE STAGE DOOR FOR HIM. I'M TELLING YOU.
Jimmy: I SAW -- DRIVE PAST IN A --
WOMEN, BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.
YOU DROVE PAST? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] OH, THAT'S REAL NICE.
Jimmy: HEY LARRY! HEY. NO SOUP FOR YOU, BUDDY! YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: FUN STUFF LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW? WELL, I WAS EXCITED TO SEE YOU TAKE OVER. I ACTUALLY CAN'T WAIT TO GO SEE THIS PLAY.
I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AFTER THE SHOW, YES.
Jimmy: YEAH, I'LL GO BACKSTAGE, ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S THE BEST, CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS. I'M REALLY EXCITED. AND IT'S JUST PERFECT.
COME ON DOWN.
Jimmy: HOW LIFE WORKS.
IT'S A BRIEF TWO HOURS, JIM. IT WILL BARELY BE A BLINK IN YOUR DAY.
Jimmy: NO, I LOVE IT. AND I LOVE THE PREMISE OF THE FUNERAL-BASED PLAY. WHICH ALWAYS --
YOU LOVE THAT? YOU LOVE A FUNERAL-BASED SHOW? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I THINK THERE IS A A LOT OF HUMOR IN DEATH.
YES, WELL, OF COURSE THERE IS.

Jimmy: I APPRECIATE THIS.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jimmy: PLEASE, I'M A FAN. I FOLLOW YOU ON INSTAGRAM, AND YOU POSTED THIS PHOTO RECENTLY OF YOU IN ROME.
OH, I WAS JUST IN ROME, YES.
Jimmy: HAVE YOU BEEN TO ROME BEFORE?
NO, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL!
Jimmy: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. BUT THEN, I SEE THIS PHOTO THAT YOU POST, AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU'RE HAVING THAT MUCH FUN AT ALL.
OH.
Jimmy: THAT'S YOU -- [ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE EVERYONE -- THERE ARE SELFIE STICKS. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE IN ALL OF ROME TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THE SELFIE STICKS FOR SALE. [ LAUGHTER ] AT EVERY -- THE VATICAN -- THERE IS JUST NINE PEOPLE AS YOU ENTER THE VATICAN. LIKE "SELFIE STICKS. SELFIE STICKS. SELFIE STICKS."
Jimmy: REALLY?
NO SHAME. EVERYONE, JUST WITH THIS -- I MEAN, LOOK. THAT WAS NOT STAGED. THAT WAS THE WHOLE TRIP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DIDN'T EVEN -- I LITERALLY -- IS THAT RIGHT? IT'S PEOPLE JUST TAKING SELFIES.
IT'S CRAZY -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH TECHNOLOGY. IT'S OUT OF CONTROL.
Jimmy: CAN'T JUST ENJOY THE BEAUTY OF IT.
I CAN'T HANDLE IT ANYMORE. THE E-MAILS, THE APPS. I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO CRASH MY CAR READING AN ALERT FOR A A GROUPON FOR SWEAT YOGA. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY DO I HAVE TO SIGN INTO FACEBOOK TO PAY MY WATER BILL? [ LAUGHTER ] FACEBOOK IS A SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE!
Jimmy: YEAH. THEY DO IT THROUGH FACEBOOK NOW.
I CANNOT TELL WHAT CAUSES ME MORE STRESS. NOT BEING ABLE TO REMEMBER MY APPLE I.D., OR GROWING UP WITHOUT A FATHER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY ON YOUR SHOW, THOUGH. THAT'S GOOD.
Jimmy: I DO, I DO. I ENJOY IT. I ENJOY THE TECHNOLOGY.
YOU'RE LIKE A TECH PERSON.
Jimmy: I'M A TECH PERSON. I LOVE IT. I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. I LIKE SEEING VIRTUAL REALITY. I DON'T EVEN -- YEAH. I ALMOST LIKE THAT MORE THAN REALITY.
REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT'S JUST SO -- IT'S VERY, VERY --
TRANSLATION, "I LIKE VIDEO GAMES." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S SO SAD. I'M AN OLD MAN. BUT --
BUT, YEAH, SORRY.
Jimmy: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR SHOW.
OKAY.
Jimmy: COMEDY CENTRAL, THIS IS BIG-TIME. 10:30, IT'S CALLED "ANOTHER PERIOD."
YES, IT'S LIKE -- IMAGINE IF THE KARDASHIANS WERE IN "DOWNTON ABBEY." SO IT'S BASICALLY, IT TAKES PLACE IN 1902 IN AMERICA, AND WE ARE JUST THESE RICH [ BLEEP ] HOLES WHO ARE TRYING TO GET FAMOUS. BUT IT'S REALLY HARD IN 1902, BECAUSE THERE'S NO TECHNOLOGY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THERE'S NO SELFIE -- THERE'S NO SELFIE STICKS. DO YOU NEED TO SEE HOW IT COMES AROUND, YOU GUYS? CAN YOU EXPLAIN SOME CHARACTERS HERE. CHRISTINA HENDRICKS, WE LOVE.
CHRISTINA HENDRICKS PLAYS OUR MAID. AND HER NAME IS CELINE, BUT WE CHANGE HER NAME TO CHAIR. [ LAUGHTER ] SO SHE DOESN'T SEEM TOO GLAMOROUS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND YEAH, THAT'S RIKI LINDHOME. AND WE ARE JUST THESE -- LIKE, IN THE PILOT, I GET INTO A HUGE FIGHT WITH HELEN KELLER AND I BEAT HER UP. [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: GOOD FOR YOU. THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING.
BUT SHE DESERVED IT.
Jimmy: NO, NO, I'M SURE SHE DOES. WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND WATCH. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE IDEA FOR THIS?
UH -- WE WERE DRUNK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, SO FAR, SO GOOD. IT SOUNDS RIGHT, YEAH.
NO, WE REALLY, RIKI AND I REALLY WANTED TO PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER, AND I --
Jimmy: YOU WRITE THIS WITH RIKI, YEAH.
RIKI AND I WROTE IT, AND JEREMY CONNOR, WHO DOES "DRUNK HISTORY," HE DIRECTED IT. SO IT LOOKS AMAZING, AND IT'S ALL REALLY BASED IN HISTORY. BUT, YEAH, IT WAS SO FUN. WE HAVE MICHAEL IAN BLACK, HE PLAYS OUR BUTLER.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, GREAT CAST. DAVID WAIN, I LOVE HIM TOO.
DAVID WAIN'S IN IT, AND YEAH. RIKI AND I, WE WERE JUST BRAINSTORMING, HAVING A GLASS OF WINE AND I WAS LIKE "I REALLY WANT TO DO THIS DRAMA --"
Jimmy: A GLASS. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THREE GLASSES OF WINE, YEAH. THERE YOU GO, YEAH. WHY NOT, LET'S OPEN ANOTHER BOTTLE. WHY NOT? HERE WE GO. THERE YOU GO. HOW ABOUT THE KARDASHIANS IN "DOWNTON ABBEY?" GOOD FOR YOU. BUT THEN YOU MADE IT, AND NOW IT'S A GIANT SHOW ON COMEDY CENTRAL.
