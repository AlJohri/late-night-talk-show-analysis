Questlove: 545.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! HEY! WOW! THAT IS A HOT CROWD RIGHT THERE. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I FEEL THE LOVE RIGHT THERE. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME! WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW!" THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE THE SHOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WELL, HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS 34-YEAR HISTORY, "USA TODAY" WEIGHED IN ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE TO SAY DONALD TRUMP IS UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I GUESS "USA TODAY" THINKS IF TRUMP WINS, THERE WON'T BE A A USA TOMORROW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THE BIG STORY OUT TODAY IS THAT TRUMP CONTINUES TO LASH OUT AGAINST A FORMER MISS UNIVERSE, TWEETING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD CHECK OUT HER SEX TAPE. AMERICANS WERE LIKE, THAT'S OKAY, BUT THANKS FOR LETTING US KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DOING LAST NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOOD. AND GET THIS, A NEW REPORT FOUND THAT DONALD TRUMP WANTED TO FIRE WAITRESSES AT ONE OF HIS GOLF COURSES BECAUSE HE DIDN'T FIND THEM ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH. SO IT LOOKS LIKE HILLARY'S NOT THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO'S HAD PROBLEMS WITH A SERVER. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I HEARD ABOUT THAT. I DIDN'T READ THE FULL STORY. I DIDN'T READ THE FULL STORY.
Steve: FULL STORY. IT'S CRAZY.
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, MSNBC ANNOUNCED IT WILL BE DOING ALL-DAY COVERAGE FOR TUESDAY'S VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. THAT'S RIGHT. A FULL DAY COVERING MIKE PENCE AND TIM KAINE. EVEN THE WEATHER CHANNEL IS LIKE, THAT SOUNDS BRUTAL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WOW, ALL DAY? OKAY. I SAW THAT HILLARY CLINTON HELD A RALLY IN IOWA YESTERDAY AND AFTERWARDS, HER CAMPAIGN DROVE VOTERS TO POLLING STATIONS FOR EARLY VOTING, WHICH IS ACTUALLY JUST A NICE WAY OF SAYING, KIDNAPPING. THAT'S SWEET, THOUGH. [ APPLAUSE ] EITHER WAY. SPEAKING OF SWEET, I THOUGHT THIS WAS KIND OF SWEET. I READ ABOUT A 98-YEAR-OLD VERMONT REPUBLICAN WHO WROTE A A LETTER TO HILLARY CLINTON TO TELL HER THAT HE'S VOTING FOR HER. OF COURSE, THE MAILBOX HE PUT IT IN WAS ACTUALLY A BIRDHOUSE, BUT STILL HE DOESN'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S 98. MAILING THIS LETTER TO HILLARY CLINTON. VERY LOUD.
Steve: YEAH.
EARLIER THIS WEEK, BERNIE SANDERS SAID THAT HE AND HILLARY CLINTON REACHED AN AGREEMENT ON A TUITION-FREE COLLEGE PLAN FOR FAMILIES EARNING LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN HE ADDED, BY AGREEMENT, I MEAN, SHE BASICALLY STOLE MY IDEA. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT YEAH. WE AGREE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, SURE. ON WEDNESDAY, BERNIE SANDERS ACTUALLY CAMPAIGNED WITH HILLARY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE JULY, AT ONE POINT, HE SEEMED TO GET DISTRACTED BY SOMETHING. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

OH, BOY. SORRY.
Jimmy: WHAT WAS THAT? THAT WAS -- DID YOU WATCH THE DEBATE? YOU MUST HAVE.
WELL, SURE, 84 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED THE DEBATE. THEY WATCHED A BLOATED PIECE OF CANDY CORN YELL AT A SICK WOMAN WITH LIPSTICK ON HER TEETH. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT WAS THE SECOND HIGHEST RATED PROGRAM OF ALL TIME.
Jimmy: IT WAS.
PASSING THE "SEINFELD" FINALE. WHICH MAKES SENSE, BECAUSE BOTH SHOWS WERE ABOUT NOTHING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU KNOW, I LOVE -- [ APPLAUSE ] I LOVE THAT TRUMP BLAMED THE MICROPHONE FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE. HE FINALLY RAN OUT OF ETHNIC GROUPS TO BLAME AND WENT ON TO INANIMATE OBJECTS. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT, LOOK -- LOOK, IN 38 DAYS, THERE'S A A 50/50 CHANCE DONALD TRUMP COULD BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OR KFC'S NEW EXTRA CRISPY COLONEL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE WOULD BE A GOOD COLONEL, WOULDN'T HE?
WATCHING THE DEBATE WAS SCARY FOR ME. I MEAN IT'S VERY TOUGH, BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, I NEVER MISS "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL."

OH, WELL, ASIDE FROM HELL FREEZING OVER? WELL, LET'S IMAGINE THAT, SHALL WE? PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS -- WELL MAYBE NOT 100. LET'S DO THE FIRST 30 DAYS. WHEN HE MOVES TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THE FIRST THING HE'LL HAVE TO DO IS CHANGE HIS MAIL ORDER BRIDE ADDRESS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN, OF COURSE, I CAN SEE HE'LL PICK A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BASED ON A SWIMSUIT COMPETITION.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THE SECOND WEEK, HE'LL PUT HIS HEAD ON MT. RUSHMORE AND HIS FACE ON THE MILLION DOLLAR BILL. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

Jimmy: HOW IS THE REAL MABEL?
WELL, SHE HAS BEEN SICK RECENTLY.
Jimmy: OH, I'M SORRY.
THIS IS, IT'S TRUE. SHE WAS ACTING STRANGELY AFTER I HAD TAKEN HER OUT FOR A WALK. SHE WAS SORT OF BLEARY EYED AND STUMBLING, AND I WAS VERY UPSET. I RUSHED HER TO THE VET, AND THEY DID SOME TESTS, AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THERE WERE STRAINS OF MARIJUANA AND PCP IN HER SYSTEM. AND THAT SHE HAD APPARENTLY EATEN THE REMAINS OF A JOINT ON THE STREET AND WAS HIGH AND HALLUCINATING. [ AUDIENCE OHS ]
Jimmy: THAT'S TERRIBLE.
NOW, I SHOULD HAVE SUSPECTED SOMETHING WHEN SHE WENT TO BURNING MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NOW I'M WORRIED BECAUSE SHE'S HANGING OUT A LOT WITH SETH ROGEN'S DOG. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S A GIVE AWAY.
NOW WHEN THE MAILMAN SHOWS UP, SHE'S LIKE, "YEAH, WHATEVER." I THINK SHE MAY BE DEALING, BECAUSE I KEEP FINDING WADS OF CASH UNDER HER DOGGY BED.

LOOK, A FRIEND OF MINE, HIS DOG ATE SOME VIAGRA ONCE, AND LET'S JUST SAY, FOR FOUR HOURS, HE COULD NOT ROLL OVER. [ LAUGHTER ]

NOPE, NO WAY THAT MY SON ISN'T THE MOST HANDSOMEST MAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SMOKING THOSE CIGARS ALL THE TIME.
SHE SAID, NO -- NOW SHE'S BRITISH.
Jimmy: MARY POPPINS IS YOUR MOM. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
MY MOM IS AT HOME JUST LIKE SHAKING HER HEAD. WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS? SHE -- SHE LIKES TO THINK IT'S THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.
Jimmy: IT IS THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. MOM, YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT. I MEAN -- LOOK AT THIS GUY. HE'S DOING GREAT, ISN'T HE AWESOME? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH BOY, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN -- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN BONKED?

Jimmy: YEAH.

Jimmy: YEAH IT'S AN -- BONK IS AN APP, A FREE APP WHERE IF YOU CAN PUT YOUR FACE IN THIS THING AND PRESS A BUTTON YOU CAN GET BONKED, AND I WAS WONDERING IF THE WORLD'S HANDSOMEST MAN HAS EVER TRIED BEING BONKED.
OH, OKAY, WHAT DOES IT DO?
Jimmy: PUT YOUR FACE IN THERE.

OH, I'M SCARED TO ASK WHAT THAT MEANS.
Jimmy: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT -- WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS?
WELL, IS HE -- DOES HE HAVE BAD LUCK GETTING THE GIRL?
YEAH.
OKAY, THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT IT MEANS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: REALLY?
SYMPATHY SIGH, THAT'S ALWAYS NICE. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: BECAUSE YOU'RE TYPECAST IN THE MOVIES?
NO, I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF MY FILMS THAT WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL, I END UP SORT OF NOT GETTING THE GIRL, YOU KNOW? I LOSE OUT TO THE, YOU KNOW, THE RYAN GOSLING AND THE HUGH JACKMANS.
Jimmy: HEY, COME ON --

Jimmy: "WESTWORLD." [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH.
Jimmy: ALWAYS IN DANGER FOR A SONG. "WESTWORLD." I LOVE WHEN YOU'RE ON, WE CAN ALWAYS PLAY AROUND WITH THAT. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. "WESTWORLD," EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS. IT'S SO SCI-FI, IT'S WESTERN, IT'S HBO, IT'S EXCITING.
YEAH, IT'S -- IT'S COMING OUT THIS SUNDAY. IT'S BASICALLY BASED ON A A MICHAEL CRICHTON MOVIE IN THE '70s WHERE IT'S A FUTURISTIC THEME PARK LIKE JURASSIC PARK, IN WHICH THE PAYING VISITORS CAN GO LIVE OUT THEIR FANTASIES, YOU KNOW, NIHILISTIC OR VIOLENT OR SEXUAL, IN THIS WESTERN TOWN THAT'S INHABITED BY ROBOTS, ESSENTIALLY.
Jimmy: AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S A ROBOT AND WHO'S PART OF THE WESTERN GAME.
RIGHT, RIGHT, THE ROBOTS ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMANS, SO YOU CAN KIND OF LIVE OUT ALL YOUR LIKE --
Jimmy: NO SPOILERS HERE. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
I WON'T TELL YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
Jimmy: HERE'S JAMES MARSDEN ARRIVING AT THE SALOON IN HBO'S "WESTWORLD." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
YOU'RE NEW. I'LL GET YOU A DISCOUNT.
NO OFFENSE, BUT I'D RATHER EARN A WOMAN'S AFFECTION THAN PAY FOR IT.
YOU'RE ALWAYS PAYING FOR IT, DARLING. THE DIFFERENCE IS OUR COST IS FIXED AND POSTED RIGHT THERE ON THE DOOR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: JAMES MARSDEN, EVERYBODY! "WESTWORLD" PREMIERS THIS SUNDAY AT 9:00 P.M. ON HBO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITHSTAND-UP FROM NIKKI GLASER. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OUR NEXT GUEST IS THE HOST OF "NOT SAFE WITH NIKKI GLASER" ON COMEDY CENTRAL. THIS WEEKEND, YOU CAN SEE HER AT THE VERMONT COMEDY CLUB IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT. EVERYBODY PLEASE WELCOME NIKKI GLASER! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
HELLO! HOW ARE YOU? SUCH AN HONOR TO BE HERE. I -- I JUST TURNED 28 IN JUNE OF 2009. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M 32, NOT MARRIED, NO KIDS. I DON'T HAVE BABY FEVER YET, UM, NOT JAUNDICE, BUT LIKE THE KIND WHERE YOU, LIKE, WANT A A BABY. I DON'T HAVE IT. I'M SCARED I'M GOING TO CATCH IT SOMETIMES. LIKE I WAS HOLDING A BABY RECENTLY, AND MY MOM WAS THERE AND SHE WAS LIKE, WELL, YOU LOOK COMFORTABLE HOLDING THAT BABY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I WAS LIKE, HARAMBE LOOKS MORE COMFORTABLE HOLDING A A CHILD THAN I DO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] SOMEONE SHOOT ME. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS SO CUTE, THOUGH. AND I WAS SCARED I WAS GOING TO LOOK AT IT AND BE LIKE, "I WANT A BABY." BUT THE MORE I LOOKED AT IT JUST LIKE CHILLING AND DROOLING, I WAS JUST, LIKE, "I WANT TO BE A BABY." LIKE, THAT WAS MY FEELING. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I JUST THINK I'D MAKE LIKE A A REALLY GREAT STAY-AT-HOME AUNT, YOU KNOW? LIKE MY SISTER IS PREGNANT. SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S HAVING. I HAVE A FEELING IT'S GOING TO BE REGRET, BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN TELL. THE WAY SHE'S CARRYING, SHE'S JUST KIND OF -- AND -- NO, NO, I'M DYING TO KNOW THE SEX SHE HAD TO CONCEIVE IT, BUT SHE WON'T TELL ME. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S LIKE, "IT'S PRIVATE." I'M LIKE, "THAT'S WHY IT'S INTERESTING." BUT I'VE BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP NOW FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS, SO WE'RE ALMOST DONE AND -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT. THANK YOU. WE'LL GET THERE. YEAH. WE LIVE TOGETHER. WE FIGHT A LOT. MOSTLY KARATE, SO IT'S KIND OF FUN. BUT HE DOES THE SILENT TREATMENT SOMETIMES, AND THAT -- THE SILENT TREATMENT SOUNDS A LOT NICER THAN IT FEELS. LIKE IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D FIND ON A SPA MENU, YOU KNOW, "WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY THE SILENT TREATMENT TODAY?" WHAT IS -- WHAT'S THAT? WELL, UH, DURING YOUR MASSAGE, YOUR MASSEUSE WILL LAY NEXT TO YOU ON THE TABLE WITH HIS BACK TO YOU AND TAKE OUT HIS PHONE AND START GOING THROUGH IT. JUST WHEN YOU THINK HE'S ASLEEP, HE'LL START CLEARING HIS THROAT AND SIGHING TO HIMSELF JUST TO LET YOU KNOW HE'S STILL AWAKE BUT CHOOSING NOT TO TALK TO YOU. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YOU'LL TRY CRY YOURSELF TO SLEEP, BUT YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TOO MANY ANTI-DEPRESSANTS, SO YOU'LL TAKE OUT YOUR PHONE AND PULL UP UBER, JUST TO REMIND YOURSELF OF ALL THE SINGLE MEN JUST CIRCLING YOUR HOUSE LIKE SHARKS, WAITING TO PICK YOU UP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOOTHING. WHERE DO YOU GO WHEN HE'S BEING LIKE THAT? I WISH THERE WAS LIKE AN IGNORED WOMEN'S SHELTER. LIKE, THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF I COULD SHOW UP THERE, LIKE, "AM I SAFE HERE?" THEY'RE LIKE, "YES." I'M LIKE, "WHAT IF HE FINDS ME?" THEY'RE LIKE, "HE'S NOT LOOKING FOR YOU, OKAY?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WE'RE -- WE'RE GOING TO TRY AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP, JUST TO REALLY DRIVE IT INTO THE GROUND, AND I ORIGINALLY BROUGHT IT UP. IT WAS EARLY ON IN OUR RELATIONSHIP, WE WERE IN BED, I WAS TRYING TO GET THINGS GOING, YOU KNOW, JUST SAYING THINGS I DIDN'T MEAN, LIKE, I LOVE YOUR MOM, LIKE WHATEVER AROUSED HIM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND I ENDED UP SAYING -- I WAS JUST LIKE, "I WOULD TOTALLY LET YOU BE WITH ANOTHER GIRL SOME DAY." DIDN'T MEAN IT BUT HERE'S THE THING. I THINK EVERY GIRL SHOULD TELL THEIR GUY THAT, EVEN IF YOU DON'T MEAN IT, JUST TO SEE HIS REACTION BECAUSE MY BOYFRIEND REACTED THE SAME WAY THAT WOMEN REACT WHEN THEY GET PROPOSED TO. HE STARTED CRYING. HE WAS LIKE, "I HAVE TO GO CALL MY DAD." I'M LIKE, "OKAY." HE'S PLANNING IT ON PINTEREST. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I HONESTLY DON'T CARE. I'M LIKE, GO DO WHATEVER AT THIS POINT. BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS LIKED HEARING HIS STORIES OF PAST HOOK-UPS, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE A TURN ON FOR ME AND HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT MANY OF THEM BECAUSE HE'S SHORT SO IT'S LIKE, HE'S SO HOT, BUT HE'S SHORT, AND SO THEY'RE ALL -- THERE'S LIKE FOUR STORIES, THEY'RE ALL FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL WHEN HE WAS THE TALLEST. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I DON'T MIND A SHORT GUY, BY THE WAY. I'M TALL. I'M 5'9" BUT I LIKE IT. LIKE OUR FIRST KISS WAS IN HIS KITCHEN AND I LIKE LIFTED HIM UP AND PUT HIM ON THE COUNTER. I FELT ALIVE. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. THEY'RE LIKE, WAIT A SECOND, "CAN YOU HOOK UP WITH OTHER PEOPLE?" AND I'M LIKE, "NO, I HONESTLY THINK HE JUST -- HE WOULD BE TOO JEALOUS TO HANDLE THAT." MY BOYFRIEND HEARD ME SAY THAT AND HE WAS LIKE, "WHY DO YOU THINK I'D BE JEALOUS?" I WAS LIKE, "OH, I JUST ASSUMED YOU WOULD BE BECAUSE REMEMBER LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WHEN MY EX-BOYFRIEND DIED AND I WAS CRYING ABOUT IT AND YOU GOT SUSPICIOUS THAT THAT MEANT I STILL LIKED HIM." SEE, THAT TOLD ME THAT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE WITH AN ALIVE PERSON ANY TIME SOON. HE WAS SERIOUSLY -- [ APPLAUSE ] HE WAS LIKE, "ARE YOU STILL ATTRACTED TO HIM?" I'M LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW. I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF IT'S AN OPEN CASKET, I'LL TELL YOU. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN A WHILE." BUT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE ME. HE'S STILL CHECKING MY OUIJA BOARD. I'M LIKE, "I'M NOT TALKING TO HIM, OKAY?" THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
