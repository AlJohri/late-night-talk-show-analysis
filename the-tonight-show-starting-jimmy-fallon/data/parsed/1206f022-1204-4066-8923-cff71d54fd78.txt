MICK CAME TO -- WANTED TO HAVE A MEETING WITH ME BACK IN 1996, '97 ABOUT DOING A FEATURE FILM SORT OF BASED ON THE IDEA OF "CASINO," IN A WAY. HE'D JUST SEEN "CASINO," AND LIKED IT, BUT THE MUSIC BUSINESS. AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME. WE TRIED WORKING WITH MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE, TRYING TO GET IT TO A FEATURE. BUT I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHERE TO STOP AND WHERE TO START -- WHERE START AND WHERE TO STOP.
Jimmy: SURE.
BECAUSE THE MUSIC. COME ON.
Jimmy: IT DOESN'T END.
I MEAN COME ON, YOU GO FROM 1945 TO 2005 AND YOU CAN KEEP GOING. AND SO EVENTUALLY, I STARTED WORKING WITH TERRY WINTER ON "BOARDWALK EMPIRE."
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. OH MY GOSH CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. [ APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU. TERRY WROTE "THE WOLF OF WALL STREET." AND SO AT ONE POINT HE WAS WRITING THE SCRIPT OF THIS, "VINYL" WHAT BECAME "VINYL," AND AT ONE POINT? I KEPT SAYING, "WHAT THIS, THOUGH? WHAT ABOUT THE '60S HERE? WHAT ABOUT SO AND SO AND ARENA ROCK AT THIS POINT AND WHAT ABOUT THE BEGINNINGS OF HIP-HOP AND ALL THIS?" AND HE SAID, "WHY DON'T WE MAKE IT A SERIES?"

YES. YEAH. WE CHOSE ULTIMATELY, IT WAS TERRY AND A NUMBER OF US GOT TOGETHER AND WE SAID, WELL, IT'S GOT TO BE THE '70s, BECAUSE THE '70s SO MUCH HAPPENED WITH MUSIC HERE, PARTICULARLY IN NEW YORK. AND APPARENTLY, ALTHOUGH I'M A A DIE HARD NEW YORKER, SO I DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE. BUT APPARENTLY THE '70s WAS A A VERY BAD DECADE FOR THE CITY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
I DID, YOU KNOW, "MEAN STREETS" AND "TAXI DRIVER," AND IT WAS NORMAL FOR ME.
Jimmy: GREAT.
SERIOUSLY, IT REALLY WAS, YOU KNOW. AND I COULDN'T TELL. EVERYBODY SAID IT WAS HORRIBLE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT CREATED AN ARTISTIC ATMOSPHERE. IT CREATED ATMOSPHERE. AND SO YOU HAVE IN '73 WHEN THE SHOW STARTS, YOU HAVE JUST -- THE WANING OF THE '60s AND THE MUSIC BECOMING A LITTLE MORE BLOATED IN A WAY, ARENA ROCK AND THIS SORT OF THING. 12-HOUR ORGAN SOLOS. YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: "VANILLA FUDGE," THAT WAS A GREAT ONE.
OH YEAH, "VANILLA FUDGE." "KEEP ME HANGING ON" GOES ON FOR HOURS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IN ANY EVENT, THE THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT IN THE '70s, THAT BEGAN A KIND OF REACTION AGAINST WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE LATE '60s AND EARLY '70s, WHICH BECAME PUNK, BECAME THE RAMONES, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, TWO MINUTES, THAT'S IT THE SONG IS OVER.
Jimmy: THREE CHORDS. YEAH. YEAH.
THREE CORDS. THAT'S IT. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO PLAY.
Jimmy: EXACTLY. THAT'S IT.
THAT'S FINE. I'M NOT SAYING THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY. A LOT OF GROUPS --
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT THEY DID
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DID. AND THE THING ABOUT IT, I USED TO LOVE -- I LISTENED TO PUNK LATER IN THE '70s. AND A COUPLE OF FRIENDS OF MINE WERE REALLY WELL KNOWN, GREAT COMPOSER MUSICIANS, BUT THEY CAN'T PLAY, SO, DOESN'T MATTER. IT DOESN'T MATTER, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: IT DOESN'T MATTER. THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF IT, YEAH.
THAT WASN'T THE POINT OF IT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY STARTED THE BEGINNINGS OF KOOL HERC, THE RECORDS, THE SCRATCHING AND THE CHANGING OF THE TURN TABLES.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND THAT SORT OF THING, WHICH EVENTUALLY LEAD TO HIP-HOP. AND I BELIEVE ALSO DISCO.
Jimmy: YOU THINK SO? DISCO, HUH? I MEAN, I'M INTO ALL THIS STUFF.
REALLY?
Jimmy: YOU GOTTA SEE MY iPAD, YEAH OR iPOD OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

I WENT AS A LITTLE KID. AS A LITTLE KID, AND I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT EXCEPT FOR SOMEHOW I STOLE A A BOX OF M&Ms WITH A A PRESIDENTIAL SEAL. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK YOU STOLE IT. THEY PROBABLY GAVE IT TO YOU.
YEAH. BUT I DID STEAL AS A KID. I ACTUALLY STOLE A FLOTATION DEVICE FROM AN AIRPLANE ONCE.

Jimmy: I THINK THEY DO. SOME AIRLINES, YEAH. MOST. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A PRETTY FUN THING TO STEAL THOUGH. I WOULDN'T THINK TO STEAL THAT. I DON'T STEAL ANYTHING. I GET AFRAID OF THAT STUFF.
OH YEAH, THAT WAS THE END OF MY RUN. I THINK I WAS REALLY SCARED.
Jimmy: THAT'S MAJOR, THAT'S A FEDERAL OFFENSE.
I KNOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THE REASON WE WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE WAS THAT MY UNCLE BY MARRIAGE WAS THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION. SO I ACTUALLY WAS DIRECTLY SCREWING WITH MY UNCLE.
Jimmy: THAT'S HIS WHOLE JOB.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THESE THINGS ARE TAKEN CARE OF TRANSPORTATION WISE.
