Jimmy: ARTIE, NO, LOOK -- HERE'S WHAT CONCERNS ME.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU GO TO A CASINO, I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO -- YOU'RE GOING TO GET INTO YOUR OLD WAYS BECAUSE YOU'RE A A GAMBLER.
YEAH, NO, IT'S HARD PLAYING CASINOS. I USED TO PLAY VEGAS AND I WAS A DEGENERATE GAMBLER. I HAD EVERY VICE, EVERY VICE. AND I USED TO LOSE -- THEY USED TO LOVE HAVING ME THERE, BECAUSE I WOULD LOSE WHATEVER I MADE.
Jimmy: BROKE EVEN EITHER WAY.
IN MY SORT OF HEYDAY, WHEN I WAS AT MY BEST, ONE SUPERBOWL EVE, AT A CASINO IN VEGAS, I MADE 140 GRAND FOR TWO STAND-UP SHOWS. THAT MONDAY, COMING BACK TO JERSEY ON THE PLANE, I FIGURED IT -- THE WEEKEND COST ME FOUR GRAND. [ LAUGHTER ] IT COST ME $4,000. AS I'M LEAVING, THEY'RE GOING, "COME BACK ANY TIME. YOU WERE GREAT."
Jimmy: THEY LOVED YOU, YEAH.
THEY LOVED ME.
Jimmy: WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I WOULD GAMBLE AND I WOULD GET HOOKERS AND YOU KNOW -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE'S OPENING UP. HE'S BEING HONEST, YEAH.
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME. I'M NOT GONNA GO THERE AND, YOU KNOW. I WOULD GET HOOKERS. [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD HAVE -- LOOK, IF I PAID FOR IT, I COULD HAVE THREESOMES. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, NOW, WITH THE WAY I LOOK NOW, I HAVE TO HAVE A A THREESOME. I NEED ONE CHICK TO HOLD UP MY STOMACH -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: ARTIE, ARTIE, ARTIE. ARTIE, NO. ARTIE, THAT'S NOT TRUE. NOW, LOOK --
IT'S WEIRD WHEN YOU HAVE TO SAY TO A HOOKER, "DO YOU HAVE A A FRIEND WHO CAN BENCH 250?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU ASK HOOKERS. THAT'S NOT -- NO, NO, NO. I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
CAN YOU FIND IT, BABE?
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT.
I'M GETTING RIDICULOUS. BUT I WOULD GO THERE -- ONE TIME, THIS WAS -- I SOLD OUT THE PLACE ON SUPERBOWL EVE. THIS GUY -- I SAID I WOULD NEVER SAY WHO IT WAS -- BUT THIS GUY WAS THE GREATEST AT HIS JOB. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE VEGAS GUYS THAT JUST GIVE YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT. THE GUYS -- YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE A PERFORMER, YOU GO THERE, YOU GET WHATEVER YOU WANT. YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE LIKE A A NICE STEAK. I LIKE, YOU KNOW, HOOKERS WITH BIG ARMS. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS GUY SAID TO ME -- THIS GUY SAID TO ME, "LISTEN, ART, I KNOW YOU JUST FLEW. GO UPSTAIRS, GET READY. WE'VE GOT YOUR SUITE READY. I'M SENDING SOMEBODY UP TO SHOW YOU YOUR ITINERARY FOR THE WEEKEND." 'CAUSE THE NEXT NIGHT I HAD TWO SOLD-OUT SHOWS. I'M LIKE, "GREAT." SO, I GO UPSTAIRS, THIS HUGE SUITE WITH FIVE GRAND IN CHIPS THAT I CAN PLAY WITH, BOOZE ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND THE DOORBELL RINGS, I FIGURE SOME GUY WITH MY ITINERARY. I OPEN IT UP AND IT'S THESE TWO SMOKING HOT STRIPPERS, LIKE TENS. A BLOND AND A BRUNETTE. AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WE'RE HERE FOR YOUR ITINERARY," YOU KNOW? AND I'M LIKE, "OH, GREAT." SO, THEY CAME IN, AND SHE SAID "CAN WE GIVE YOU A LAP DANCE?" AND, YOU KNOW, ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER AND I SLEPT WITH THESE TWO GIRLS. I HAD A -- IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IT WAS SO ROCK AND ROLL.
Jimmy: WE ARE SO NOT TWINS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE ARE SO --
YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. BUT I -- HERE'S THE THING. THESE CHICKS, IF YOU PAY THEM -- I DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY THEM ANYTHING. THE GUY PAID THEM, I GUESS. THEY WERE LYING TO ME ON LEVELS. THEY WERE TELLING ME I HAD NICE BONE STRUCTURE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO WE HAD SEX -- [ LAUGHTER ] SO WE HAD SEX AND, LOOK, WE'RE ALL ADULTS HERE. BUT THEY GAVE ME THESE PILLS. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS, BUT THEY GAVE ME THESE PILLS THAT MADE ME PARANOID. I WAS VERY PARANOID FROM THESE PILLS THEY HAD. AND I HAD ALL OF MY VALUABLES OUT. I HAD MY WALLET AND THE CHIPS, THE FIVE GRAND IN CHIPS, I WANTED TO GAMBLE LATER. SO I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. AND IT'S A BIG PLACE SO I SAID -- I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ALL OF THIS STUFF IN FRONT OF THEM, BUT I DON'T WANT TO INSULT THEM BY LUGGING MY WALLET INTO THE TOILET. WITH MY BAG, I'LL JUST BE RIGHT IN HERE, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SO WHAT DID YOU DO?
SO WHAT I DID, I REMEMBERED AN OLD TRICK. WHEN ME AND MY BUDDIES WERE ALL SORT OF SCUMBAGGY WHEN WE WERE KIDS, THE DELI OWNER, IF HE LEFT US ALONE, HE'D MAKE US CLAP OUR HANDS. IF YOU KEEP CLAPPING YOUR HANDS, YOU CAN'T STEAL ANYTHING. YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] SO IF HE HEARD US STOP CLAPPING OUR HANDS -- SO I SAID TO THESE GIRLS, I SAID, "LISTEN. I WANT TO PLAY --" I WAS SO PARANOID. I SAID, "I WANT TO PLAY A GAME WITH YOU GIRLS." AND THEY'VE HEARD EVERYTHING. JUST KEEP CLAPPING YOUR HANDS WHILE I'M IN THE BATHROOM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" I SAID, "OH, DON'T TELL ME THAT'S NOT THE WEIRDEST THING YOU'VE EVER -- [ LAUGHTER ] LAST NIGHT, YOU WERE PROBABLY DRESSED LIKE AN EAGLE WITH TODD BRIDGES OR SOMETHING." SO I SAID, "JUST KEEP CLAPPING YOUR HANDS." I GO IN, I'M DOING MY BUSINESS, I'M SITTING ON THE BOWL AND I JUST HEAR THEM CLAPPING. THEY NEVER STOPPED CLAPPING. I COME OUT IN JUST A ROBE. AND IT WAS SO FUNNY. THEY DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING AND THEY KEPT CLAPPING, BUT AS I CAME OUT, IT WAS THE ODDEST THING. IT LOOKED LIKE -- YOU KNOW HOW WHEN A MOTHER POTTY TRAINS THEIR KID? [ LAUGHTER ] AND AFTER THEY GO TO THE BATHROOM, THE MOTHER IS LIKE -- [ CLAPPING ] YOU KNOW, IT LOOKED LIKE I WENT TO THE BATHROOM AND THESE TWO, HOT STRIPPERS WERE, LIKE --
Jimmy: YEAH! GREAT JOB! YOU DID GREAT!
YOU MADE DOOTY, YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU MADE DOOTY.
YOU MADE DOOTY.
Jimmy: SEE, ARTIE, THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING, BUT WHAT HAPPENS NOW WHEN YOU GO TO A A CASINO?
NOW, I'M PLAYING IN THE BORGATA IN ATLANTIC CITY, AND NOW I DON'T DRINK, I DON'T SMOKE, I DON'T GAMBLE, I DON'T HAVE SEX WITH HOOKERS.
Jimmy: GOOD.
ALL I'M ALLOWED TO DO IS STARE AT A WALL. AS LONG AS I DO IT IN MODERATION. SO NOW -- [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN ONLY DO THIS AS LONG AS I DO IT NO LONGER THAN TEN MINUTES. SO, NOW, THE CRAZIEST PERSON THAT COMES UP TO MY ROOM AT THE BORGATA WILL BE THIS GUY WHO WORKS FOR ROOM SERVICE FROM SOUTH AMERICA OR URUGUAY WITH LIKE FIJI WATER.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO, YEAH.
THE ONLY SIMILARITY IS WHEN I GO TO THE BATHROOM, I STILL MAKE HIM CLAP. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] I SAY, "PEDRO, LISTEN, DO YOU MIND?" AND FOR 20 BUCKS, THEY'LL HELP YOU MOVE A BODY.
Jimmy: I'VE GOT TO SAY, YOU GUYS, "CRASH AND BURN" IS VERY FUNNY. IT'S IN PAPERBACK RIGHT NOW.
