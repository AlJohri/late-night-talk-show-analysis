YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS IT. YOU'RE HERE. THAT'S THE ENERGY YOU WANT, OH, MAN. GUYS, WELCOME. WE HAVE A GREAT, GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. WE HAVE A LOT OF SPORTS NEWS TO COVER IN THE MONOLOGUE. YEAH, BECAUSE THE BIG STORY OF THE WEEKEND WAS THE RACE HORSE, NYQUIST WON THE KENTUCKY DERBY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CONGRATULATIONS. NYQUIST WATCHES THE SHOW EVERY NIGHT.
Steve: YEAH, HE'S WATCHING EVERY NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NYQUIST WON THE KENTUCKY DERBY WHILE A HORSE NAMED EXAGGERATOR CAME IN SECOND PLACE. OR AS EXAGGERATOR PUT IT, "I WON THE KENTUCKY DERBY!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS COOL, ON SATURDAY, METS PITCHER BARTOLO COLON HIT HIS FIRST HOME RUN AFTER 19 YEARS IN THE BIG LEAGUES. MAKING HIM THE OLDEST PLAYER TO EVER HIT HIS FIRST HOME RUN. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU CAN TELL IT WAS HIS FIRST HOME RUN BECAUSE AT FIRST BASE HE STOPPED AND ASKED FOR DIRECTIONS TO THE NEXT ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] TO THAT ONE? THANK YOU, MAN. [ APPLAUSE ] WANT TO SAY CONGRATS TO OLYMPIC SWIMMER MICHAEL PHELPS AND HIS FIANCé WHO JUST WELCOMED THEIR FIRST CHILD. [ APPLAUSE ] IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BABY WAS BORN, HE LOOKED UP AND SAID, "HOW WAS MY TIME?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] LET'S CHECK IN ON THE ELECTION HERE. I SAW THAT JEB BUSH WROTE A A FACEBOOK POST CONGRATULATING DONALD TRUMP FOR SECURING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION BUT SAID HE STILL WON'T SUPPORT HIM. YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT, JEB WROTE AN INSINCERE FACEBOOK POST OR AS IT'S ALSO KNOWN, A FACEBOOK POST. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "OMG, YOU'RE ENGAGED, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU." THAT'S RIGHT, JEB BUSH ANNOUNCED ON FACEBOOK THAT HE WILL NOT SUPPORT DONALD6TRUMP OR HILLARY CLINTON. EVEN WORSE, THE ONLY TWO LIKES ON THAT POST WERE FROM DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "FANTASTIC, THANK YOU, MAN!" GET THIS, ON "MEET THE PRESS" YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASED, SAYING, QUOTE, I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE MAKE IT ON $7.25 AN HOUR. THEN HIS BUTLER SAID, "JUST BARELY, SIR." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "YOUR COFFEE?" OF COURSE, THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION RECENTLY OVER DONALD TRUMP'S TAX PLANS. ACCORDING TO TRUMP'S PLAN, TAXES WOULD GO DOWN FOR THE WEALTHY BUT ACCORDING TO TRUMP HIMSELF, TAXES ON THE WEALTHY WOULD GO UP. HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY AND LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID.
DO YOU WANT TAXES ON THE WEALTHY TO GO UP OR DOWN?
THEY WILL GO UP A LITTLE BIT. AND THEY MAY GO UP --
BUT THEY'RE GOING DOWN IN YOUR PLAN.
IN MY PLAN THEY'RE GOING DOWN. BY THE TIME IT'S NEGOTIATED, THEY'LL GO UP. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I GUESS TRUMP REALLY IS A POLITICIAN. JUST PROMISED BOTH THINGS. EITHER WAY YOU'RE RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] "OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING DOWN. THE RICH WILL PAY MORE IN TAXES, MAKING THEM POOR AND THEY'LL PAY LESS." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] RIGHT. SURE, SURE. AND TODAY HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN SAID THAT HE WOULD STEP DOWN AS CHAIR OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION IF DONALD TRUMP ASKED HIM TOO. RYAN SAID THE HARDEST PART OF WALKING AWAY FROM THE CONVENTION WOULD BE TRYING NOT TO SKIP AWAY FROM THE CONVENTION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND CHECK THIS OUT, I READ THAT A COSTCO IN AUSTRALIA STARTED SELLING COFFINS IN SOME OF ITS STORES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS GREAT UNTIL YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THE CASHIER WHY YOU'RE BUYING COFFINS IN BULK. IT'S LIKE, "DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YOU ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS." [ LAUGHTER ] LITTLE CELEBRITY NEWS HERE. IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT THE KARDASHIANS WERE FRUSTRATED WHEN THEY WERE IN CUBA BECAUSE MOST CUBANS HAD NOT SEEN THEIR SHOW SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE FAMOUS.

Steve: BETTER GET ONE MORE.
Jimmy: "BAKER'S DOZEN OF COFFINS." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, A LOT OF ONE DIRECTION FANS ARE UPSET ABOUT THIS. HARRY STYLES REVEALED ON FRIDAY HE CUT OFF HIS SIGNATURE LONG HAIR TO DONATE TO CHARITY. HARRY SAID THAT HIS OLD HAIR WAS GOING TO A GREAT CAUSE. WHILE, THE PERSON WHO GOT THE HAIR SAID -- [ DONALD TRUMP IMPRESSION ] "FINALLY, I LOOK EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL."

YES, IT WAS LIKE MOSTLY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES BUYING LUNCH FOR, LIKE, HOSPITALS, IN ORDER TO COERCE THEM INTO PUSHING THEIR PRODUCTS. IT WAS A REALLY GREAT GIG. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN.
MINIMUM WAGE NO LESS. THERE WERE A FEW THINGS THAT SUCK YOUR SOUL MORE THAN LIKE, DRIVING TWO HOURS FOR MINIMUM WAGE TO HAND SOME FAJITAS OFF, LIKE, COURTESY OF WHATEVER.
Jimmy: DID YOU LET THEM KNOW WHEN YOU FINALLY -- WHEN YOU GOT "HAMILTON," LIKE, I'M OUT HERE YOU GUYS?
I JUST DIDN'T COME BACK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU JUST DIDN'T SHOW UP?
I JUST DIDN'T SHOW UP. I JUST DISAPPEARED. ACTUALLY, HAD -- I DID MY TAXES HELLA LATE. [ LAUGHTER ] I APPLIED FOR THE EXTENSION, LIKE, IT'S ALL GOOD.
Jimmy: I'M NOT HERE TO BUST YOU.
I KNOW, WHY YOU RIDING ME LIKE THAT, JIMMY? COME ON MAN!
Jimmy: "MONEY MONSTER."
TOTALLY LEGAL. NO, I DID MY TAXES REAL LATE AND HAD TO -- DIDN'T -- I LOST THE W-2 THEY SENT ME FOR LIKE, THE $800 I MADE WHILE I WAS WORKING THERE. SO I HAD TO CALL. HAD TO CALL TO GET, LIKE, THE MANAGER TO TEXT ME A PICTURE OF THE THING. JUST LIKE, "HEY, MAN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER ME. I WORKED THERE FOR A FEW MONTHS AND I JUST STOPPED COMING."
Jimmy: OH, YEAH, WE LOVE YOU. YOU'RE THE GREATEST.
REALLY GOT TO GET THESE TAXES DONE. THEY'RE DUE TOMORROW. THEY WERE ACTUALLY VERY NICE.
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU HEAR ABOUT "HAMILTON?" JUST FROM RAP CIRCLES?
I KNOW LYNN AND TOMMY SO WE'RE ALL PART OF A GROUP CALLED FREESTYLE-UP SUPREME WHICH IS SORT OF AN IMPROVISED RAP EVENT THAT COMBINES SORT OF A LOT OF THEATER AND RAP MUSIC. IT'S ENTIRELY IMPROVISATIONAL. I WAS SORT OF A SIXTH MAN FOR THAT A LOT OF TIMES WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS TOO BUSY, THEY WOULD FLY ME OUT FROM CALIFORNIA TO COME DO A SHOW IF THEY COULDN'T FILL ONE UP. CHRIS JACKSON FROM "HAMILTON" IS IN THAT TOO. IT'S LIKE A REALLY ACCOMPLISHED GROUP OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY. JAMES MONROE -- I WAS THE GENIE IN ALADDIN. WHO IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THIS GROUP. IT'S LIKE SQUAD, THE SQUAD IS DEEP. BUT UM -- YEAH, SO I WAS A PART OF THAT FOR A LONG TIME. WE WERE ACTUALLY AT THE SUPER BOWL WHEN IT WAS IN NEW ORLEANS, RAPPING ABOUT SPORTS CELEBRITIES. TOMMY APPROACHED ME IN THE MIDST OF THAT GIG WHICH WAS A A CRAZY WEEK AND SAID, "HEY, LYNN'S WORKING ON A NEW PROJECT. IT'S A RAP MUSICAL ABOUT ALEXANDER HAMILTON." I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA. YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY SEND ME THAT SCRIPT." I WILL GO WHEREVER YOU WANT ME TO GO IF THERE'S A PAYCHECK ATTACHED TO IT. SO COME ON RIGHT OUT, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: AND DID YOU KNOW, BECAUSE RIGHT OFF THE BAT, DID YOU GO, THIS IS MY -- I'M NAILING THIS?
NO, IT WAS SO TERRIFYING. WE DID -- THEY SENT ME THE MUSIC AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED AND APOLOGIZED. WHAT DO I HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DO? DO I HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO SING? SHOULD I BE TAKING A VOICE LESSON? I HAD NEVER DONE THAT IN FRONT OF PEOPLE BEFORE. AND THEN TO SHOW UP ON THE FIRST DAY OF REHEARSAL FOR THIS FIVE-DAY READING I WAS ASKED TO BE IN THE ROOM WITH CHRIS JACKSON. THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE. ANIKA NONI ROSE WAS THERE --
Jimmy: WHEN YOU FIRST EVEN COME OUT ON THE STAGE, I JUST, LIKE, OH MY GOD, I LOVE THAT GUY, HE'S SO COOL. I'D NEVER SEEN YOU IN ANYTHING BEFORE. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU. I WAS BLOWN AWAY BECAUSE -- IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE PLAY, YOU PLAY LAFAYETTE. AND YOU'RE RAPPING AS LAFAYETTE WITH A FRENCH ACCENT.
MY BRILLIANT FRENCH ACCENT.
Jimmy: YEAH. SECOND HALF OF THE PLAY, YOU'RE THOMAS JEFFERSON.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND I GO, THIS IS JUST FANTASTIC. THAT YOU'RE DOING -- NUMBER ONE YOU'RE DOING BOTH. SECOND OF ALL, AS A BLACK GUY PLAYING THOMAS JEFFERSON. YOU DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. THAT'S HOW GOOD YOU GUYS ALL ARE. THAT WAS THE LAST THING.
THAT ONE SNEAKS UP ON YOU LATER. HEY, WASN'T THAT --
WAIT A A SECOND.
WAS THAT A STAND-IN FOR THOMAS JEFFERSON? EXACTLY. IT WAS JUST SO WELL DONE. IT WAS JUST GOOSE BUMPS. I JUST LOVE THAT. I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END AT ALL. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T NEED MY ENDORSEMENT BUT YOU GOT NOMINATED FOR THE TONY AWARDS. THAT'S A BIG THING. CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S A REALLY BIG THING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU ALSO HOLD THE -- FOR THE RECORD, YOU -- YOU'RE ALSO THE FASTEST RAPPER ON BROADWAY BECAUSE IN "GUNS AND SHIPS," YOU SAY 19 WORDS IN THREE SECONDS.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S A LOT OF WORDS.
IT'S A LOT WORDS, IT'S NOT A A LOT OF SECONDS.
Jimmy: AN AVERAGE OF .144 WORDS -- IS IT WHAT IS IT? THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE RIGHT. .144 WORDS PER MINUTE. I THINK THE OTHER ONE WAS MORE IMPRESSIVE. 19 WORDS IN THREE SECONDS. THAT'S VERY FAST. ARE YOU USED TO RAPPING THAT FAST?
YEAH. I MEAN, THAT'S SORT OF -- THAT'S FAST. IT'S NOT, NOT FAST. IT'S ABSOLUTELY FAST. IN THE RAP WORLD, THAT'S MEDIUM FAST.
Jimmy: REALLY?
IT'S FAST, BUT IT'S NOT THE FASTEST. THERE ARE FASTER.
Jimmy: IS THAT LIKE -- CAN YOU GIVE US A TASTE OF FASTER? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU ALWAYS HAVE -- THEY ALWAYS HAVE -- BUT I'M NOT GOING TO RAP NO, PLEASE, NO. DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?
NO. RIGHT? THAT WAS A CLIPPING SONG SO I'LL DO ANOTHER CLIPPING SONG.
