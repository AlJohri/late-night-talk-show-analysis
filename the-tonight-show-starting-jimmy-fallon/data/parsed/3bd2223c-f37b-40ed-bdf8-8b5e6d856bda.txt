Jimmy: OH MY GOD, DID YOU TALK --
I DIDN'T HAVE THE NERVE TO TALK TO HER, THOUGH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HEY, THIS IS A A BEAUTIFUL SHIRT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK TO THE SHOW. I DO LOVE --
WELL WAIT. BEFORE WE GO ON, I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY, TO WEAR ONE, TOO. I BROUGHT YOU ONE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YEAH, RIGHT. OF COURSE.
NOW WAIT, I'LL LET YOU PICK. YOU CAN EITHER WEAR THIS, OR YOU CAN WEAR THIS SWEATER THAT HAS A DINOSAUR ON IT.

Jimmy: SURE. I THINK WE'RE GOING WITH THE SHIRT, RIGHT?
SHIRT? [ CHEERS ] ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: IT'S PRETTY NICE. THANKS, MAN, I APPRECIATE IT.
SORRY, I KNOW ITS HOT.
Jimmy: NO, NO PROBLEM. I LIKE IT. [ BARKING ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] KIND OF A SCOOP NECK TO IT.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: I LOVE THE SCOOP NECK.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THANKS, MAN. I APPRECIATE THAT.
A LOW RIDE.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S LIKE A LOW RIDE ON THE COLLAR. THAT'S GOOD. SUBTLE. IT'S ALMOST LIKE I'M NOT EVEN WEARING ANYTHING, YOU KNOW.
THAT'S HOW WE LIKE IT.
Jimmy: THAT'S HOW WE LOVE IT. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUDDY. I DO LIKE -- THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SHIRT. I MEAN, I LOVE THE HAWAIIAN SHIRT.
I WORE THIS SHIRT IN TORONTO TO A PARTY. AND IT KIND OF MADE A SPLASH, SO I'M TRYING TO KIND OF KICK MY CAREER UP A NOTCH, SO I FIGURE -- THIS IS ALL RIGHT, THIS IS WHAT I GOT TO DO TO GET ATTENTION.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL. THAT'S NOT TRUE. BUT "NOCTURNAL ANIMALS," MAN OH MAN, YOU GOT -- YOU'RE GETTING RAVE REVIEWS FOR THIS, KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK WITH THIS ONE.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THAT'S FANTASTIC. CONGRATULATIONS. EVERYONE'S BUZZING AND TALKING ABOUT IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: YOU WERE -- I WANT TO GET TO THAT, IN A SECOND, BUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LAST TIME YOU WERE ON THE SHOW ABOUT HOW YOU'RE KIND OF LIKE -- YOU DON'T REALLY DO FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND YOU DON'T A, YOU DON'T HAVE A SMART PHONE. YOU HAD, LIKE, A FLIP PHONE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE.
OH, DAMN.
Jimmy: WHAT?
I DIDN'T BRING IT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT, DO YOU STILL HAVE THE FLIP PHONE?
NO, I DON'T HAVE A FLIP PHONE. NOW I HAVE ONE OF THOSE SLIDEY KIND OF PHONES.
Jimmy: YES, WAIT, LIKE A A T-MOBILE SIDEKICK?
IT SAYS KYOCERA ON IT. BUT YEAH, IT'S LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: KYOCERA? IS IT A CAR?
YEAH IT'S A CAR/TINY PHONE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] IT'S A -- IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A LOCK ON IT, IT'S ALWAYS DIALING PEOPLE IF I PUT IT IN MY POCKET ANYWHERE, AND THEN PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SAYING YOU BUTT DIALED ME AND I'M LIKE, WELL, NO, IT WASN'T MY BUTT. IT WAS MY -- IT WAS MY CHEST OR WHATEVER THIS PART OF MY BODY IS. BUT I DON'T PUT MY PHONE IN MY BACK POCKET.
Jimmy: YOU DIDN'T TRY AN iPHONE AT ALL? YOU WON'T?
OH WELL, I HAD ONE, I WAS IN TORONTO RECENTLY AND THEY GAVE ME ONE TO USE, WHICH WAS NICE 'CAUSE I COULD FACETIME WITH MY KIDS.
Jimmy: THAT'S NICE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM. YOU CAN READ LIKE THE FIRST 20 PAGES OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT BOOKS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I'D BE SITTING IN THE RESTAURANT THERE BY MYSELF, MISSING, YOU KNOW, HOME, AND SO I'D GO ON THE iBOOKS AND GET LIKE, YOU KNOW, "THE SUN ALSO RISES" SAMPLE. YOU KNOW, FIRST 20 PAGES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IF YOU DO THAT, THEY RECOMMEND OTHER BOOKS TO YOU.
OH THEY WOULD, YEAH, THEY WOULD RECOMMEND LIKE HOT NOVELS, THE SEXY -- YOU KNOW. BUT I'D JUST READ THE FIRST 20 PAGES. I DIDN'T HAVE TO FEEL GUILTY, BECAUSE IT WAS JUST THE FIRST 20 PAGES.
Jimmy: I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, WE HAD MS. GALLAGHER AND SHE GAVE US THE OPTION TO EITHER READ "WHITE FANG" OR THIS BOOK BY DANIELLE STEEL.
OH WHAT?
Jimmy: AND I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THAT WAS THE CHOICES.
IN SCHOOL?
Jimmy: YEAH, IN SCHOOL. YEAH.
WOW.
Jimmy: I HOPE IT WAS SCHOOL. YEAH, I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT WAS. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WAS. IT WAS -- LOOKED LIKE SCHOOL.
IT LOOKED LIKE A SCHOOL, YEAH.
Jimmy: I DON'T REMEMBER, YOU KNOW. BUT I REMEMBER I WAS, LIKE -- I'LL CHOOSE THE DANIELLE STEEL, I'D NEVER HEARD OF DANIELLE STEEL. SO I READ IT. IT'S FANTASTIC BOOK.
OH, YEAH? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] SO HOW MANY HAVE YOU READ NOW?
Jimmy: WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I READ ANY MORE AFTER THAT, BUT THIS ONE WAS THERE, SHE GOT IN CAR, TERRIBLE CAR ACCIDENT, THIS GIRL. AND SO SHE HAD HER FACE, WAS REMOVED. SO THEY HAD A FACE RECONSTRUCTED, OKAY? BUT HE ALSO, WAS IN THE ACCIDENT, AND HE GOT AMNESIA, OKAY. SO THEY'RE IN THE HOSPITAL. HE DOESN'T REMEMBER WHO SHE IS AT ALL. NOT LIKE IT WOULD HELP, SHE HAS A NEW FACE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEY STILL FELL IN LOVE. [ AUDIENCE AWS ]
THAT JUST SHOWS THAT IS, DEEP DOWN UNDERNEATH, IT'S LIKE A SPIRITUAL CONNECTION.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S A A SPIRITUAL, YEAH. WE'VE ACTUALLY DID A LITTLE RESEARCH AND FOUND YOU "THE PROMISE", DANIELLE STEEL.
OH, IS THIS THE BOOK?
Jimmy: THAT'S THE BOOK, AND WE RIPPED OUT ALL THE PAGES. ALL YOU HAVE IS 20 PAGES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
OH, THANK YOU. I JUST, YEAH. THAT'S REALLY ALL I'M INTERESTED IN.
Jimmy: WE RESEARCHED -- THAT'S THE BOOK I READ IN HIGH SCHOOL. YOU'LL ENJOY THE FIRST 20 PAGES. IT'S FANTASTIC.
THE PROMISE, MAN.
Jimmy: BUDDY, TELL ME ABOUT "NOCTURNAL ANIMALS." WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM YOU IN, IN THIS FILM?
WELL IT'S FUNNY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT READING, CAUSE' IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT A WOMAN WHO READS A BOOK.
Jimmy: THAT IS TRUE.

SHE'S PHENOMENAL.
Jimmy: EVERYBODY'S GREAT.
