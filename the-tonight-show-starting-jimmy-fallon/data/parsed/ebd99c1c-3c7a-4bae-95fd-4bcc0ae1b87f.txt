SHE'S FROM NEW YORK. SHE'S COMPLICATED. VERY HIGH STANDARDS.
TYPE "A"? THAT CAN MAKE YOU CRAZY IF YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT. YOU SEEM PRETTY LAID BACK. TYPE "B." SPEAKING OF WHICH, AMY'S BLOOD TYPE?
GOD, I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE TO LOOK IT UP AT THE HOUSE.
YOU DON'T KNOW IF SHE HAS FRIENDS, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE DOES ALL DAY, AND YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR WIFE'S BLOOD TYPE?

THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THIS IS A GIANT THING. EVERYONE'S TALKING. THIS THURSDAY, 9:00.
9:00.
Jimmy: ALL THE BUZZ HERE ON NBC.
OH, GOOD. YEAH.
Jimmy: WE'RE ALL -- WE'RE SEEING YOUR POSTERS EVERYWHERE, AND I'M GETTING READY TO INTERVIEW YOU AND I SEE THAT YOU'RE OUT THERE DOING DANGEROUS THINGS --
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THINGS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING BECAUSE "BAD JUDGE" IS ON THURSDAY AT 9:00 --
I KNOW.
Jimmy: AND WE NEED YOU THERE. INSTEAD, YOU'RE DOING -- YOU'RE RIVER RAFTING. THIS IS A MISTAKE. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS? IS YOUR LIFE NOT EXCITING ENOUGH?
YEAH, I KNOW. THIS WAS RIGHT BEFORE WE STARTED SHOOTING. I JUST WANTED TO PUSH IT.
Jimmy: WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M SUBMERGED IN THE WATER. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ME RIGHT THERE. I'M THE CAPTAIN. OH, NO, THERE IT IS. THAT'S WHERE IT'S REALLY -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS AWESOME. WHAT IS GOING ON? WHAT HAPPENED? HOW DO YOU GET ROPED INTO THIS AND TELL ME THE STORY.
WELL, WE WENT WITH MY BOYFRIEND, HIS KIDS, AND MY BROTHER. IT WAS A FAMILY THING. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO RIVER RAFTING. WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO BIG WEEK-LONG TRIPS. SO, WE WENT UP TO OREGON, THE UPPER KLAMATH RIVER. THAT'S OUR GUIDE.
Jimmy: THE GUY IN THE BACK, IS THAT NORMAL?
HE'S UP IN THE BACK. HE'S ROWING. YOU HAVE TO WORK AS A TEAM. LIKE, YOU HAVE TO. IF YOU DON'T, IT'S LIKE THE MILITARY. IT'S SERIOUS. I DID FEEL LIKE I WENT INTO SOME WEIRD WAR MOVIE. I WAS LIKE, "GO! WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER!" BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T PADDLE IN SYNC, YOU GET TOSSED IN THE WATER. AND THEY PREPARE YOU FOR IT. IT'S SUPER DANGEROUS. WE WERE IN CATEGORY 3 AND 4 RAPIDS.
Jimmy: OUT OF HOW MANY CATEGORIES?
5 IS DEATH -- 5 IS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING. I DON'T LIKE WHEN PEOPLE SAY, "OH, IS IT THREE ALARM CHILI?" OUT OF HOW MANY ALARMS?
I KNOW.
Jimmy: OUT OF TWO ALARMS. WAIT, THIS IS A THREE? UNPRECEDENTED GHOST ALARM?
I'M LIKE, "WHAT'S FIVE?" THEY'RE LIKE, "NIAGARA FALLS." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SO, CATEGORY 3/4?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: I LOVE THAT THEY SAY 3/4.
3/4.
Jimmy: LIKE, WHAT IS IT, A A THREE OR A FOUR?
IS IT THREE OR FOUR?
Jimmy: WAIT, SO THIS IS, SO WHAT -- YOU DIDN'T FALL OUT, DID YOU?
OH, YES I DID. I WAS PREPARED THE ENTIRE TIME. I WAS THE CAPTAIN, MY BROTHER WAS CO-CAPTAIN. HE SORT OF GOT JETTISONED, FELL ON ME AND KNOCKED ME OUT OF THE BOAT. HE'S GOT TO GET BACK IN THE BOAT. GET BACK IN THE BOAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, RIGHT, YOU SAY THAT. BUT IT'S NOT EASY TO GET BACK. I CAN'T EVEN GET ON A FLOATY IN MY POOL. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.
IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET BACK IN THE BOAT.
Jimmy: UNLESS I HAVE STAIRS SOMETHING I CAN GRAB ON TO. LIKE, WHIP MY LEG AROUND, LIKE "NO ONE TOUCH ME." THIS IS MOVING, THE WATER'S MOVING. OH, NO.
IT'S NOT PRETTY. IT'S DEFINITELY NOT.
Jimmy: THE GUY THAT HELPS -- ARE YOU ON A LEASH OR SOMETHING?
NO, YOU HAVE A LIFE JACKET ON, THEY LIFT YOU. AND THEN YOU GET IN AND IT'S SLOPPY AND HORRIBLE. THAT WASN'T THE WORST OF IT OR THE BEST OF IT. YOU GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH. THIS IS CRAZY ADVENTURE. THIS GUY, OUR LEADER, JUST ABOUT MIDWAY THROUGH THE DAY, HE -- HIS SHOULDER DISLOCATED. AND WE HAD TO PULL OVER, IF YOU WILL, ON THE WILD RIVER.
Jimmy: WHAT?
I'M LIKE, "WHAT HAPPENED?" HIS ARM'S LIKE HANGING.
Jimmy: WHAT?
I'M LIKE "HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET DOWN THE RIVER?"
Jimmy: WHAT? HE'S THE GUIDE?
HE'S THE GUIDE.
Jimmy: WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE? WAIT, WHAT? I WOULD FREAK OUT. IF YOU START HEARING BANJOS, I'D BE LIKE "NO, WE GOTTA -- WE'RE IN TROUBLE, MAN." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE WORST RIVER RAFTING THING WE'VE EVER DONE. GUY'S LIKE, "MY SHOULDER POPPED OUT!" JUST KIDDING MAN. ♪♪
I KNOW. HE WANTED US TO --
Jimmy: HIS SHOULDER POPPED OUT?
HIS SHOULDER POPPED OUT AND HE WANTED US TO POP IT BACK IN. I WAS LIKE, "I CAN'T." I STILL WANT TO HELP YOU. I COULDN'T.
Jimmy: SCREAMING IN PAIN?
YES, HE WAS SCREAMING IN PAIN. SELFISHLY I'M LIKE "HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET DOWN THE RIVER?"
Jimmy: YEAH, OF COURSE YOU ARE. I FEEL BAD FOR YOU AND EVERYTHING, BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU DO ALL THE TIME AS AN ACTRESS! [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ] I'M BAD JUDGE! I'M BAD JUDGE, COME ON!
SEE THIS?
Jimmy: YEAH, YOUR RIVER GUIDE. SPEAKING OF "BAD JUDGE." GREAT PROMOTION, BY THE WAY. ALL OVER THE PLACE. GREAT PROMOTION. I WANT TO SAY, I WANT TO THANK YOUR MOM.
OH, MY GOSH.
Jimmy: YOUR MOM -- BEST PROMOTION. THIS IS WHAT MAKES -- I LOVE MOMS EVERYWHERE. MOMS ARE THE BEST THINGS IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.
YES.
Jimmy: HERE IS WHAT YOUR MOM --

Jimmy: THAT'S AWESOME THAT MOM DID THAT.
MY BROTHER'S LIKE, "THERE'S NO DATE OR TIME."
Jimmy: IT'S A MYSTERY.
IT'S LIKE, AM I RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW? JUST "BAD JUDGE."
Jimmy: "BAD JUDGE", YOU FIGURE IT OUT. LEAVE ME ALONE. BUT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS. BECAUSE YOU PRODUCED THIS AS WELL AS ADAM McKAY AND WILL FERRELL.
YES.
Jimmy: I MEAN, GOSH, THREE OF THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE TOGETHER.
YEAH. COME ON.
Jimmy: I LOVE ALL THOSE GUYS SO MUCH. WORKING WITH THEM ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." BUT YOU KNEW THEM FROM CHICAGO.
YEAH, ADAM AND I GO WAY BACK FROM CHICAGO. ADAM USED TO MAKE CRANK PHONE CALLS TO MOVIE THEATERS AND PRETEND TO BE A MANAGER FROM ANOTHER MOVIE THEATER TO GET FREE TICKETS. 'CAUSE YOU KNOW ADAM, HE'S GIANT, HE'S GOT THAT VOICE. LIKE, "THIS IS ADAM McKAY. I'M MANAGER FROM THE MANN CINEPLEX 8 IN WINNETKA. WE'RE COMING DOWN WITH THE FAMILY AND WE NEED SIX PASSES." WE WOULD GET THAT AND PIZZA, SOMEHOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I MEAN, HE'S THAT FUNNY. HE'S A GENIUS. ONE OF THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE I EVER MET IN MY LIFE.
SO FUNNY. SO WE'RE HAVING A BLAST.
Jimmy: WHAT IS THIS? I THINK I KNOW WHAT THIS IS, BUT "BAD JUDGE."
"BAD JUDGE", SO SHE'S A -- I PLAY A JUDGE ON THE ESTEEMED COURT OF VAN NUYS SUPERIOR COURT AND I'M VERY GOOD AT MY JOB, BUT I'M KIND OF A TOTAL PARTY GIRL. AND SORT OF GIVES OUT -- HANDS OUT CREATIVE SENTENCING TOO. BUT IT'S SORT OF LIKE A LITTLE 17-YEAR-OLD DUDE LIVES INSIDE OF HER THAT JUST WANTS TO GET OUT AND ROCK OUT AND PLAY IN A A BAND AND DRIVE AROUND IN HER CRAPPY VAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DRIVE AROUND IN A A CRAPPY VAN. BUT YOU'RE A JUDGE, YOU'RE IN THE ROBE AND YOU'RE VERY OFFICIAL. YOU DO THE THING, LIKE, COME ON. ALMOST LIKE A JUDGE JUDY THING.
YES.
Jimmy: THEN YOU SPLIT AND YOUR ROBE COMES OFF AND YOU'RE LIKE, "LET'S GO."
YEAH.

ALL RIGHT, COUNSELOR, A A WORD.
