THANKS SO MUCH.

YEAH, I KNOW. AND CONGRATULATIONS.
Jimmy: I WEAR BETTER SUITS NOW.
THIS IS THE BIG ENCHILADA. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS IT.
Jimmy: THE BIG ENCHILADA, YEAH. I, LIKE EVERYONE IN AMERICA, GOT WORLD CUP FEVER FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE WERE ALL INTO IT, WATCHING, BUT I NOTICED YOUR VOICE KEPT COMING ON WHEN IT WAS TEAM USA. YOU DID THE SPOTS FOR ESPN.
I DID, YEAH. IT WAS ACTUALLY A REAL HONOR TO BE ASKED BECAUSE IT -- IT'S SUCH A HUGE TOURNAMENT. AND TO ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE IT IN ENGLAND, WHERE WE WERE SHOOTING "24" WAS SO DIFFERENT. IT'S SUCH A FOOTBALL NATION. IN FACT, THE U.S. IS KIND OF THE ONE NATION IN THE WORLD THAT IS NOT AS SOCCER CRAZY AS THE REST OF THE WORLD.
Jimmy: NO, YEAH.
BUT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT WAS FANTASTIC. IT WAS KIND OF IRONIC BECAUSE, UH -- THE GUYS IN THE BOOTH THAT I WAS WORKING WITH WERE ALL ENGLISH. AND THEY WERE KIND OF -- YOU KNOW, SNICKERING AT --
Jimmy: THEY GOT ELIMINATED.
-- AT THE AMERICAN'S CHANCES AT PROCEEDING THROUGH THE MAIN GROUP. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, UH --
Jimmy: AS WE ARE MOST AMERICANS AT ONE POINT. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M SURE. AND THEY PLAYED FANTASTICALLY WELL. IN THAT FIRST GAME AGAINST GHANA, THEY WERE JUST BRILLIANT. SO, WHEN I CAME BACK TO DO THE SECOND ONE --
Jimmy: WAIT. I CAN'T BELIEVE --
-- THEY WERE A LITTLE MORE QUIET. AND THEN WHEN I CAME BACK TO DO THE THIRD ONE --
Jimmy: THEY'RE LIKE, "JACK IS BACK AGAIN, ISN'T HE'" "YEAH, HERE WE GO."
THEY WERE MUTTERING, KIND OF, "I CAN'T BELIEVE AMERICA GOT THROUGH AND WE DID -- AND ENGLAND DIDN'T." [ LAUGHTER ] SO, IT WAS A GOOD TIME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SO EXCITING. THOSE GUYS PLAYED SO GOOD. BUT I KNEW IT WAS YOUR VOICE. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU CAN HEAR PEOPLE DOING A VOICE AND I KNEW IT WAS YOUR VOICE. I WAS LIKE, "OH, THAT'S A A PERFECT VOICE TO REPRESENT AMERICA." YOU'RE LIKE, "WE PLAYED GHANA." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW' I WAS LIKE, "OH, THAT IS SO KIEFER SUTHERLAND."
WELL, THEY WERE VERY DRAMATIC SPOTS. I REMEMBER THE SECOND SPOT. "YOU MAY HAVE READ THE HEADLINES, BUT WE DIDN'T. WE WERE TOO BUSY WIPING OFF THE BLOOD." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN' IT'S LIKE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME'
Jimmy: IT WAS SO GOOD. IT WAS LIKE -- IT WENT VIRAL ON TWITTER. IT WAS SO COOL. I WAS JUST ACTUALLY OUT IN LONDON FOR WIMBLEDON.
I KNOW, YEAH.
Jimmy: I WENT OUT THERE. IT WAS GORGEOUS WEATHER FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEK.
YEAH, WELL.
Jimmy: BUT YOU'VE BEEN SHOOTING "24" OUT THERE.
WE WERE SHOOTING SINCE JANUARY. IN ALL FAIRNESS, ENGLAND HAD A A VERY, VERY HARD WINTER THROUGH DECEMBER. BUT WHEN WE GOT THERE THROUGH JANUARY ALL THE WAY THROUGH SHOOTING THROUGH JUNE, WAS REALLY NICE. AND THEN, I REMEMBER THE DAY BEFORE WIMBLEDON STARTED, WE HAD SCHEDULED HALF A DAY OUTSIDE ON THE STREET AND HALF A DAY INSIDE. AND SO, WE START SHOOTING THE DAY. AND I REMEMBER A COUPLE OF THE GUYS IN THE CREW SAID, "YOU KNOW, WE BETTER GET THIS DONE BY ABOUT 2:00 O'CLOCK." AND I SAID, "WHY'" HE SAID, "WELL, IT'S GOING TO RAIN." AND I LOOKED UP IN THE SKY AND THERE WASN'T A CLOUD TO BE SEEN. IT WAS A PERFECT DAY. AND HE SAID, "IT'S THE CURSE OF WIMBLEDON. I PROMISE YOU. THE SECOND WIMBLEDON STARTS, IT WILL START TO RAIN." [ LAUGHTER ] AND I AM NOT JOKING. TO THE MINUTE, AT 2:00 O'CLOCK, THREE CLOUDS CAME OVER --
Jimmy: WELCOME TO WIMBLEDON, EVERYONE!
-- AND JUST RAINED ON WIMBLEDON IN LONDON.
Jimmy: RAIN DELAY!
AND THEN I REALIZED, THEY HAD JUST FINALLY BUILT A ROOF OVER THAT STADIUM LAST YEAR.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A A HUNDRED YEARS.
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY. THEY FINALLY BUILT IT.
EVERYBODY HAS A ROOF.
Jimmy: "DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A ROOF'"
NO.
Jimmy: "NO, OF COURSE NOT."
Jimmy: I GOT TO SAY CONGRATS ON THIS ONE, FRIEND. LOOK AT THIS. NUMBER ONE. GREATEST ACTION HERO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S EXCITING RIGHT THERE.
I JUST SAW THAT.
Jimmy: THAT'S AWESOME.
I WAS ON A PLANE, I THINK, WHEN THAT CAME OUT. I JUST SAW THAT WHEN I GOT HERE.
Jimmy: THAT'S SO EXCITING.
NO, THAT'S AN HONOR. THAT'S VERY NICE OF THEM TO THINK THAT.
Jimmy: AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT "24" CAME BACK AND THAT IT'S AWESOME. JACK BOWER IS STILL KICKING ASS AND YOU'RE STILL YELLING, "DAMN IT!"
YES.
Jimmy: THAT'S YOUR CATCHPHRASE. "DAMN IT!" [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, IT'S --
Jimmy: "DAMN IT, CHLOE!" [ LAUGHTER ] "DAMN IT!"
THERE'S NO OTHER EXPLETIVE YOU CAN USE ON NETWORK TELEVISION. I MEAN, REALLY THERE ISN'T A A SINGLE OTHER ONE.
Jimmy: YEAH, THERE ISN'T ONE.
AND THERE WAS SO MANY MOMENTS FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY WE SHOT TO NOW, WHERE NOT ONLY AS A CHARACTER, BUT MYSELF AS A A PERSON, NEEDED SOMETHING TO GET OUT OF THE SCENE. AND THAT SEEMED TO BE THE WORD. [ LAUGHTER ] WE REALLY NEVER MEANT IT TO CATCH ON LIKE IT DID.
Jimmy: SOMEONE FROM THE INTERNET COUNTED IT UP.
OH, NO. REALLY' [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: A GRAND TOTAL OF 144 TIMES YOU'VE SAID "DAMN IT." THERE YOU GO RIGHT THERE. 144 AS OF RIGHT NOW. ♪♪ "DAMN IT, CHLOE! DAMN IT!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WELL, THE IRONY IS I THINK THAT NUMBER IS ABOUT HALF THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE I KILLED ON THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY.
YOU CAN'T SWEAR, BUT KILL AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU WANT.
Jimmy: KILL A THOUSAND PEOPLE. SURE, SURE, SURE. IT'S GREAT THIS YEAR. IT'S SO FUN. I JUST LOVE SEEING CHLOE COME BACK. YOU KNOW, MARY LYNN IS JUST A A GREAT ACTRESS.
SHE'S FANTASTIC.
Jimmy: IT'S JUST EVERYBODY'S GREAT. THE WRITERS ARE GOOD. DID YOU EVER THINK THAT IT WAS GOING TO GO THIS LONG'
I DON'T THINK -- YOU KNOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS, WHEN YOU DO A A SHOW, YOU DO IT IN STAGES. YOU DO A PILOT, WHICH IS THE VERY FIRST SHOW. THEN IF THEY LIKE THE PILOT, THEY'LL PICK UP ANOTHER 13. AND IF THEY LIKE THAT, THEN THEY PICK UP THE REST OF THE RUN AND FOR US THAT WAS ANOTHER 11. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE PICKED UP AS A PILOT BECAUSE IT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
THEN IT GOT PICKED UP AS A A PILOT. I DON'T THINK ANYONE ON OUR CREW THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO GET PICKED UP FOR THE -- AFTER THAT 13. AND WHEN IT DID, I WALKED OVER TO THE CREATOR, A WONDERFUL WRITER AND MAN NAMED JOEL SURNOW AND I SAID, "CONGRATULATIONS. THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT." AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND IT WAS THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER SEEN HIM LOOK THAT SCARED IN MY LIFE. AND HE SAID, "I -- I DON'T THINK WE CAN WRITE THE NEXT 11. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE HAVE YOU SAYING "DAMN IT" 300 TIMES IN ONE SCENE.
THIS IS NOT THE POINT TO TELL ME THAT.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. YOU SCARING ME, YEAH. BUT THEY DID A GREAT JOB WITH THIS.
BUT IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE HONOR AND A PRIVELAGE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT.
Jimmy: IN THE BIG FINALE, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST RUIN THE FUN OF IT, BUT IT IS USUALLY SOME CLEVER TWIST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW. ARE YOU NOT JACK BOWER OR SOMETHING'
THAT WOULD BE COOL. I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, SEE I TOLD YOU! YOU DIDN'T HIRE ME. YOU DIDN'T READ MY SPEC SCRIPT. FAN-FICTION.
WE MAY NEED THAT. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK, KIND OF VERY MUCH LIKE THAT FIRST YEAR WHERE THEY'RE KIND OF WRITING ON THE GO. THEY CAN TAKE A STORY DOWN A A DIRECTION AND AS THINGS START TO BECOME OBVIOUS, AND THEN THEY CAN MAKE A REAL RIGHT OR LEFT TURN ON YOU. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE STAPLES OF "24," AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE VERY CONSCIOUSLY TRIED TO DO WITH THIS SEASON. SO, I HOPE IT DELIVERS. WE'RE CERTAINLY REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT. I SPENT THE LAST SIX MONTHS NERVOUS BEYOND BELIEF JUST FINISHING EACH EPISODE. BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR, WHICH WAS THE SHOW, AND TO OPEN THAT CAN UP MADE ME NERVOUS. SO NOW THAT WE'RE FINISHED, NOW I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO SEE IT AND I HOPE THEY ENJOY IT.
Jimmy: WELL, AS AN AUDIENCE MEMBER, I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR LETTING US PLAY ALONG WITH THIS.
SURE.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE MOST FUN THING IN THE WORLD. I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. IT'S NOT TOO REVEALING.

GUYS, I FOUND OUT A LOT. THEY'RE MUCH BETTER LIVING OUTDOORS. SO, I BUILT THEM THIS BEAUTIFUL OUTDOOR TURTLE COOP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE NAME FOR IT. TURTLE COOP'
I CREATED THIS COOP. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
Jimmy: I GOT TO GO ONTO YOUR FORUMS AND SEE IF THAT RIGHT TERM.
NO, IT'S AMAZING. BECAUSE AES COOP. SO IT'S GORGEOUS. IT HAS A LID FOR WHEN IT RAINS. THEY HAVE A LITTLE SUNROOF.
Jimmy: WATER SLIDE.
YEAH, A LITTLE SUN DECK. IT'S VERY COOL.
Jimmy: HOW MANY TURTLES DO YOU HAVE'
TWO TURTLES. WE NOW HAVE FIVE CHICKENS. BECAUSE WHEN I WAS INVESTIGATING --
Jimmy: WHERE DO YOU LIVE AGAIN'
I LIVE IN L.A.
Jimmy: PERFECT. OKAY, THAT'S THE PERFECT PLACE. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
YES, YES.
Jimmy: ARE YOU ALLOWED TO HAVE CHICKENS IN L.A.'
YOU ARE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE RAISING CHICKENS IN NEW YORK. AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE I ALSO JOINED AN URBAN CHICKEN ONLINE FORUM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I GOT TO GET YOU OFF THE INTERNET. THIS IS FRIGHTENING.
NO, IT'S SO FUN.
Jimmy: IT'S NOT SO FUN AT ALL.
IT IS.
Jimmy: WHAT DO YOU TALK ABOUT' LIKE HOW MANY EGGS YOU GET'
I FIND OUT A LOT. I FIND OUT A LOT ABOUT -- I'VE BEEN RAISING THESE CHICKENS SINCE THEY WERE A DAY OLD. THEY WERE BIRTHED, SEXED AND SHIPPED TO MY HOUSE AT ONE DAY OLD.
Jimmy: OKAY, I GOT BIRTHED. I GOT SHIPPED. WHAT IS SEXED' [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: CAN YOU TELL WHAT SEX THEY ARE'
YES. I CAN ONLY HAVE HENS. SO, WE'VE BEEN RAISING THEM SINCE THEY WERE A DAY OLD. AND THEY WERE LIVING INSIDE. THEY JUST MOVED OUTSIDE NOW. AND I'M OUT THERE WITH THEM EVERY DAY.

Jimmy: MM-HMM.
SO, THAT LOVE NEVER WENT AWAY. LIKE, WHEN I SEE BRITNEY SPEARS, I TURN INTO MY 15-YEAR-OLD SELF. I CAN'T EVEN HANDLE IT.

OKAY.
Jimmy: SO -- NOW.

Jimmy: SO WHEN IT WAS YOU GOING TO SEE BRITNEY --
SO, I FINALLY WENT TO GO SEE HER IN CONCERT. I'M GROOVING. I'M HAVING THE BEST TIME. I'M IN VEGAS. ALL OF A SUDDEN HER BIG SECURITY GUARD JUST TAPS ME ON THE SHOULDER. HE SAYS, "COME WITH ME."
Jimmy: UH-HUH.
OKAY. SO, I WALK -- HE PULLS ME UP ON STAGE. ALL OF A SUDDEN -- NO ONE'S EVEN EXPLAINING ANYTHING TO ME, BUT IT WAS JUST SO EXCITING. ALL OF A SUDDEN, HER DANCERS COME OVER TO ME. AND THEY JUST WHISPER, "GET ON ALL FOURS." AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE LIKE, "WAIT. AM I AT THE MILEY CYRUS CONCERT' WHAT CONCERT AM I AT'"
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST DON'T QUESTION. IT WAS SO BIG.

Jimmy: HAPPILY MARRIED, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A A REALITY SHOW. I CALL IT REAL LIFE COMEDY. IT'S NOT SCRIPTED. IT'S NOT REALITY. IT LIVES SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN, AND IT'S JUST SO MUCH FUN. AND I'M THE BUTT OF THE JOKE. MY FAMILY IS ON IT. MY SISTER IS ON IT. MY DAD IS ON IT.
