YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE GREAT SCENES WITH EDWARD NORTON. HERE'S WHY IT WOULD FREAK ME OUT THOUGH --. BECAUSE, IF YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE A LOT OF THE SHOTS ARE LIKE THESE LONG TRACKING SHOTS WHERE THEY START IN ONE ROOM. AND THEN THEY GO INTO A A HALLWAY. AND THEN INTO ANOTHER ROOM. AND THEN, IT'S LONG. SO, YOU'RE SEEING MICHAEL KEATON ACT IN ONE SCENE AND THEN GOING OVER TO ZACH GALIFIANAKIS ACTING. AND THEN, EVENTUALLY.THEY JUST COME TO YOU. AND YOU HAVE LIKE, TWO, TWO LINES. AND I WOULD BE SO NERVOUS, I WOULD BE LIKE -- OH, IT'S ALMOST MY PART, OKAY THEY'RE COMING AROUND. -- SORRY, I SCREWED UP. AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO RESET THE WHOLE SCENE AND EVERYONE HATES ME.
THAT IS EXACTLY --.
Jimmy: EDWARD NORTON WON'T TALK TO ME.
EXACTLY HOW IT WENT. EDWARD NORTON STILL WON'T TALK TO ME. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I'M THINKING ABOUT GIVING HIM A PART IN "NO TURKEY FOR PERKY."
Jimmy: SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YEAH, YEAH, COULD BE A GOOD ONE.
HE COULD BE GOOD AS PERKY.
Jimmy: HE WOULD BE VERY, VERY GOOD. I MEAN. WAS IT LIKE THAT? I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE THE WHOLE MOVIE IS BASICALLY A LONG TRACKING SHOT.
AND THOSE WERE -- THOSE WERE THE SCARIEST ONES, WHEN THERE WAS A SCE -- THERE WAS ACTUALLY A SCENE BETWEEN MICHAEL AND -- MICHAEL KEATON AND EDWARD NORTON. AND, IT WAS LIKE A FIVE OR SIX-MINUTE SCENE THAT WAS JUST INCREDIBLE. BOTH, I MEAN, IT WAS JUST -- IT WAS A HUGE SCENE. AND THEN I COME IN AT THE END OF THE SCENE, AND JUST KIND OF HAVE TO LEAD EDWARD AROUND THE CORNER. AND IF I WENT TOO FAST, THE ENTIRE THING WAS -- LIKE, IF I MOVED TOO FAST AROUND A CORNER, THE WHOLE TAKE WAS RUINED. WHICH HAPPENED.
Jimmy: NO, IT DID NOT.
I WAS GOING TOO FAST. THEN IT WAS LIKE, BACK TO THE BEGINNING. THEY WERE LIKE, THANKS A LOT.
Jimmy: THANKS A LOT, MISSY.
Both: REALLY APPRECIATED IT. SO MUCH.
Jimmy: SO MUCH. EXACTLY. HOW DO YOU KNOW? [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I WAS THERE. I WAS THE GUY HOLDING THE MICROPHONE. LOOK FAMILIAR?
THAT WAS YOU!
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT WAS ME. BUT THE MOVIE'S ABOUT MICHAEL KEATON, WHO PLAYS THIS CHARACTER BIRDMAN. BIRDMAN ONE, BIRDMAN TWO, BIRDMAN THREE. HE WAS IN THREE SEQUELS TO THE MOVIE BIRDMAN.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND THEN HE DIDN'T DO THE FOURTH BIRDMAN.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: AND THEN HIS CAREER JUST KIND OF FALTERS OFF AND HE KIND OF FEELS LIKE HE'S FORGOTTEN ALMOST, A FORGOTTEN ACTOR.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND SO HE GOES BACK TO BROADWAY AND WRITES AND DIRECTS AND ACTS IN THIS PLAY. TRYING TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT HE'S RELEVANT. THAT HE MEANT SOMETHING. AND IT'S SO MOVING. IT'S A KILLER PERFORMANCES BY EVERYBODY. WE HAVE A SCENE HERE. THIS IS -- I MEAN, HE'S JUST -- HE CAME BACK FROM A BAR. HE'S DRUNK. AND HE'S, HE'S JUST RIDING YOU PRETTY HARD. YOU'RE HIS DAUGHTER.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND YOU GO, AND YOU JUST HAVE TO YELL BACK AT HIM. AND HERE'S THE CLIP, HERE'S EMMA STONE IN "BIRDMAN."
YOU WERE DOING THE PLAY BASED ON A BOOK THAT WAS WRITTEN 60 YEARS-AGO FOR A A THOUSAND RICH OLD WHITE PEOPLE. WHO'S ONLY REAL CONCERN IS GOING TO BE WHERE THEY GO TO HAVE THEIR CAKE AND COFFEE WHEN IT'S OVER. NOBODY GIVES A -- BUT YOU! AND LET'S FACE IT, DAD. YOU ARE NOT DOING THIS FOR THE SAKE OF ART. YOU ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO FEEL RELEVANT AGAIN. WELL, GUESS WHAT, THERE IS AN ENTIRE WORLD OUT THERE WHERE PEOPLE FIGHT TO BE RELEVANT EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND YOU ACT LIKE IT DOESN'T EXIST. THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN A PLACE THAT YOU IGNORE. A PLACE THAT, BY THE WAY, HAS ALREADY FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU. I MEAN -- WHO THE -- ARE YOU? YOU HATE BLOGGERS, YOU MOCK TWITTER, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A A FACEBOOK PAGE. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DOESN'T EXIST. YOU'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED TO DEATH, LIKE THE REST OF US, THAT YOU DON'T MATTER. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU DON'T. IT'S NOT IMPORTANT, OKAY? YOU'RE NOT IMPORTANT.
