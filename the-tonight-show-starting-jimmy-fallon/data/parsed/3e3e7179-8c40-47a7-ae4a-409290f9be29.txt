Jimmy: JUST, CHATTING IT UP AND HAVING A GOOD TIME. BUT YOU'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW WITH JOHNNY HOW MANY TIMES?
OVER 140 I THINK?
Jimmy: 140 TIMES, WOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YEAH. I'M WATCHING THE FIRST, SEASON FOUR RIGHT? I'M WATCHING THE "INSIDE COMEDY" IT'S A FANTASTIC SHOW. IF YOU LOVE JUST -- WELL IF YOU LOVE COMEDIANS, BUT IF YOU LOVE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE CRAFT OR HOW THEY GOT TO WHERE THEY ARE OR JUST -- IT'S JUST FASCINATING. THE FIRST EPISODE IS JON STEWART AND STEPHEN COLBERT.
YES.
Jimmy: AND THEY'RE BOTH SO INTERESTING AND SO GREAT. AND JON WAS TALKING ABOUT COMING UP AT THE BITTER END, THE CLUB HERE IN THE CITY.
YES. AND THAT WAS WHERE A LOT OF COMEDIANS STARTED OUT. I STARTED OUT AT THE BITTER END. I WAS AT SECOND CITY IN CHICAGO FOR A LONG TIME. AND THEN WHEN I DID STARTED STAND UP WAS AT THE BITTER END. AND THE BITTER END WAS BASICALLY -- THE VILLAGE WAS VERY, FOLK CLUBS IN THE SIXTIES.
Jimmy: NOT JUST COMEDIANS.
YEAH, THERE WERE ONLY FOLK SINGERS. AND YOU OPENED FOR FOLK SINGERS. ROCK WAS JUST STARTING TO COME IN. BUT ACROSS FROM THE BITTER END WAS A PLACE CALLED THE CAFE A A GO-GO. AND WHEN I WAS WORKING TO 17, 19 PEOPLE A NIGHT. RICHIE PRYOR WAS ACROSS THE STREET WORKING TO 18, 20 PEOPLE A NIGHT. SP WE WOULD COMPARE NOTES. I WOULD GO SEE HIS SHOW AND HE WOULD COME SEE MINE.
Jimmy: RICHIE PRYOR?
RICHARD PRYOR. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AT THE TIME HE WAS RICHIE PRYOR. YOU GOT TO SEE THE RISE OF RICHARD PRYOR.
ABSOLUTELY. HE WAS WORKING. WE WERE DOING WHATEVER WE DO. MY VERSION, WE WOULD SEE EACH OTHER AND HAVE A DRINK AFTERWARDS AND THAT WOULD BE IT. WE'D TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WE WERE DOING. BUT HE WAS WORKING A COUPLE WEEKS AT THE CAFE A GO-GO AND ABOUT THE THIRD WEEK WE MET AFTERWARDS AND HE SAID I'M DOING SOME NEW THINGS AND WHY DON'T YOU COME ACROSS AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND I WENT ACROSS. I ROTATED MY SHOW TO SEE HIM. AND HE WAS ALREADY THE MOST RADICAL, UNIQUE, EDGY, FUNNY COMEDIAN I'D EVER SEEN FROM TWO WEEKS BEFORE.
Jimmy: JUST SWITCHED A A COUPLE THINGS UP.
HE WENT TO THE VILLAGE GATE DOWN THE STREET. PEOPLE STARTED TO LINE UP AND THEN IT WAS ALL CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE THE AUDIENCE WAS A A LITTLE MORE SQUARE.
Jimmy: HOW DID PEOPLE REACT?
THEY WEREN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: NO.
BUT TO SEE THAT TRANSITION --
Jimmy: BUT THE COMEDIANS WERE HAPPY. 'CAUSE YOU GOT TO SEE A BRAND NEW COMEDIAN.
UNBELIEVABLE. LEADING THE WAY, ACTUALLY.
Jimmy: I -- I SEE EVEN IN YOUR POSTURE NOW. YOUR FINGERS ARE TOGETHER AND YOU'RE UP. YOU'RE ALMOST EXCITED LIKE A A LITTLE KID, LIKE "SO TELL ME WHAT IT'S ABOUT." YOUR CURIOSITY COMES THROUGH ON THE SHOW THAT YOU CARE ABOUT WHAT SOMEONE IS TELLING YOU ABOUT THEIR STORY. AND YOU HEAR THE STUFF FROM JON STEWART. YOU GO, GOSH I KNEW HE WAS A A COMEDIAN BUT DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE GOT STARTED OR COLBERT AND --
COLBERT AT SECOND CITY. YOU GET TO A, IT'S A VERY LOOSE KIND OF CONVERSATION. AND I GO LONG ENOUGH SO THAT WE GET ENOUGH STUFF AND I LOVE DOING THIS SHOW. I LOVE "INSIDE COMEDY." I LOVE THE GUESTS THAT COME ON. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY AGREE. YOU WERE ONE OF MY FAVORITES. YOU JUMPED INTO IT SO FAST.
Jimmy: OH, NO, I WAS HONORED TO EVEN BE ASKED TO COME ON. BUT WHO ELSE IS ON THIS SEASON?
WE HAVE MICHAEL KEATON AND DAN AYKROYD.
Jimmy: OH MY GOSH.
WE HAVE BRYAN CRANSTON AND CAROL LEIFER. WANDA SYKES, TED DANSON. CHEECH AND CHONG, DANE COOK.
Jimmy: HOW ARE CHEECH AND CHONG?
CHEECH AND CHONG ARE FABULOUS!
Jimmy: REALLY? 'CAUSE I KNOW THEY'RE BACK NOW, RIGHT?
THEY ARE FABULOUS. I THINK THEY WERE HIGH WHILE I WAS TALKING TO THEM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S THE WAY -- IT'S THE SECRET TO THE WHOLE THING, ABSOLUTELY. WELL I CAN'T WAIT. YOU GUYS HAVE TO CHECK OUT THE SHOW, IT'S SO GOOD. PLEASE MAKE THIS THE FIRST OF MANY APPEARANCES. COME BACK WHENEVER YOU WANT TO, PLEASE.
