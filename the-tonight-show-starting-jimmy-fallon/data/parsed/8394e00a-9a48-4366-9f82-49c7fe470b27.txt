Jimmy: NO, I'M NOT RUBBING IT IN. I'M JUST SAYING. LET'S GO BACK. LET'S GO BACK. SO THIS IS WHEN YOU FIRST GOT SUPER FAMOUS. AND YOU WERE -- I MEAN, IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY.
IT DID. IT HAPPENED QUICKLY TO THE PUBLIC. BUT WE WERE ACTUALLY UNDERCOVER FOR LIKE A YEAR WRITING OUR MUSIC AND GETTING OUR LOOK TOGETHER. BECAUSE WE DID EVERYTHING OURSELVES. WE WERE KIND OF LIKE HOMEMADE, HOME-GROWN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT WASN'T LIKE PLANNED BY ANYBODY ELSE APART FROM US. HENCE THE OUTFITS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] YEAH. IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.
Jimmy: SO HOW ABOUT MONEYWISE? LIKE MAKING MONEY, WHEN DID YOU FIRST START MAKING MONEY?
OH MY GOD. I REMEMBER GETTING MY FIRST BIG CHECK. WE CAME OUT IN 1996. AND "WANNABE" WENT TO NUMBER ONE IN MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. I REMEMBER HOLDING THE CHECK THINKING, "OH MY GOD. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH MONEY IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE." YOU KNOW, I HAD COME FROM A A REGULAR BACKGROUND, ON THE POOR SIDE BACK THEN.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO I WAS LIKE, WELL, LET ME JUST BUY MOM AND DAD A HOUSE AND A CAR. AND MAYBE A FEW WATCHES. THAT WILL JUST GET RID OF IT FOR A MINUTE. I WAS SO EMBARRASSED TO HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY. BUT NOW I LOVE IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, NOW YOU'RE MEL B. BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT BACK THEN. HOW COOL AND GENEROUS.
NO.
Jimmy: HOW COOL. IT ALL COMES BACK TO YOU.
IT DOES.
Jimmy: AND HERE YOU ARE ON "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT." THIS IS THE SEASON EVERYONE IS WATCHING THIS ONE. LAST TIME WE TALKED, BECAUSE I GO, THERE'S GOING TO BE A A MAGICIAN WHO'S GOING TO WIN.
I SAID THAT. I CALLED THAT FROM THE GET-GO.
Jimmy: I KNOW. BEFORE YOU KISSED FOREHEAD, WE SAID THERE'S GOING TO BE A A MAGICIAN. AND NOW I SAY THIS YEAR IT'S NOT A MAGICIAN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Jimmy: WELL, IT'S SOMETHING WITH DOGS AGAIN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THAT. I LIKED THEM THAT ONE YEAR, BUT NO I DON'T WANT TO GO SEE A DOG SHOW.
I PRESSED MY GOLDEN BUZZER ON THE SINGER, SHARON. SO MAYBE IT'S GOING TO BE A A SINGER.
Jimmy: THE NEW GOLDEN BUZZER I LIKE, BY THE WAY. THE GOLDEN BUZZER SENDS YOU RIGHT -- DIRECTLY TO LIVE AT RADIO CITY. RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. SO I CAN COME TO YOU ALL THE TIME.
YEAH. THERE YOU GO.
Jimmy: WE CAN HANG OUT AND GRAB TEA TOGETHER.
YEAH, LET'S.
Jimmy: COOL. PINKY SWEAR.
YEAH. I'D LIKE THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SO YEAH, SO THE SINGER. I'LL GO WITH YOU, BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOOD TASTE. IF YOU'RE SAYING A SINGER IS GOING TO GO, I SAY A SINGER IS GOING TO GO TOO.
OR A BAND. A GOOD LIKE, ROCK BAND.
Jimmy: YEAH. I FEEL LIKE THAT'S GOING TO BE A THING. AND, LIKE THE PRIZE IS A A RESIDENCY, RIGHT?
A RESIDENCY AND $1 MILLION. I KNOW IT'S PRETTY --
Jimmy: WHY AM I NOT AUDITIONING FOR "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT?" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DO A GREAT BEACH BOYS IMPRESSION. [ LAUGHTER ]
I KNOW. I HEARD. I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I WANT TO COME ON AND SING WITH YOU NEXT TIME AND DO A SILLY SKIT.
Jimmy: YOU WANT TO?
I'D LOVE TO DO THAT.
Jimmy: YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY NO. WE WILL PITCH YOU EVERY SINGLE DUMB IDEA. AND JUST, A LOT OF PEOPLE -- IF IT DOESN'T GET PAST THEIR PUBLICIST, THEY GO, "OH, THEY WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
I'M DOWN FOR TAKING TH MICKEY OUT OF MYSELF. I LOVE THAT.
Jimmy: DID YOU GUYS HEAR THIS? SHE'S GONNA TAKE HER -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELL, CONGRATULATIONS ON ALL OF THAT. AND WHEN YOU'RE BACK HERE, COME STOP BY AND MAYBE WE'LL WRITE YOU SOME STUFF AND WE'LL DO SOMETHING SILLY AND FUN.
YEAH. LET'S DO THAT.
Jimmy: I ALWAYS LOVE IT WHEN YOU'RE HERE. MEL B, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT," AIRS TUESDAYS AND WEDNESDAYS, MY FAVORITE. TUESDAYS AND WEDNESDAYS AT 8:00 P.M. ON NBC. WE HAVE STAND-UP FROM RUSSELL HOWARD NEXT. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY! ♪♪
Jimmy: WE ARE JOINED RIGHT NOW BY ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR COMEDIANS IN THE U.K. HE'S SOLD OUT THE O2 ARENA MULTIPLE TIMES. HIS AWARD-WINNING BBC SHOW "RUSSELL HOWARD'S GOOD NEWS" STARTS ITS 10th SEASON IN OCTOBER. PUT IT TOGETHER FOR A VERY FUNNY MAN. HERE IS RUSSELL HOWARD, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. WOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I LOVE THE POSITIVITY OF THIS LAND. IT'S INCREDIBLE. WHOOPING. [ CHEERS ] YES. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN ENGLAND. I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE EVER WHOOP. YESTERDAY, A MAN IN A DINER CAME UP TO ME AND WENT, "YOU'RE ENGLISH! THAT'S AWESOME!" [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE I HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. LIKE I WAS IN MY MOM'S BELLY, POINT YOURSELF TOWARDS WESTMINSTER! [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN HE SAID SOMETHING MAGNIFICENT. HE HONESTLY -- HE LOOKED TO ME AND WENT, "LET ME TELL YOU THIS, MAN. ENGLISH WOMEN, OH! [ LAUGHTER ] THEIR BREASTS ARE AMAZING. TELL YOUR PEOPLE." TELL YOUR PEOPLE? LIKE I'M GOING TO WANDER BACK, "LADIES, GATHER ROUND. [ LAUGHTER ] I BRING WORD FROM THE NEW WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY HAVE DECLARED YOUR ORBS MAGNIFICENT! AS YOU WERE, YOU FAT TITTED MAIDENS!" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] TELL YOUR PEOPLE. I LOVE MOMENTS OF MADNESS LIKE THAT. I WAS IN IRELAND LAST YEAR. IT'S A LOVELY THING. THERE'S A LADY ABOUT 70 HAVING A CUP OF TEA. AND THEN HER PHONE RANG. AND NOBODY COULD HAVE PREDICTED THE NOISE THIS SWEET OLD LADY'S PHONE WOULD MAKE. BECAUSE FROM NOWHERE, IT JUST WENT -- ♪ I'M TOO SEXY FOR MY SHIRT ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] SHE PICKED IT UP AND WENT MAD, "STOP CALLING ME! I SAID IT BEFORE. I WILL KILL YOU!" [ LAUGHTER ] AND SHE TURNED TO ME AND WENT, "SORRY ABOUT THAT, LOVE. MY HUSBAND CHANGED MY RINGTONE, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT." [ LAUGHTER ] HAD ME LIKE, "EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WANTS TO MEET THAT OLD MAN AND SHAKE HIM BY THE HAND." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HAVE AN IMAGE OF A A 70-YEAR-OLD MAN JUST FOLLOWING HIS WIFE AROUND TOWN. BINOCULARS IN HAND, "SHE'S IN A A RESTAURANT. DAVE, RING THE PHONE. RING THE PHONE NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] SHE DOESN'T LIKE THAT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS BETTER THAN THE TIME WE PUT COCAINE IN HER SUGAR BOWL! LOOK AT HER GO." I LOVE A GOOD PRANK. LAST YEAR, RIGHT? WE STOLE MY MOM'S PHONE AT CHRISTMAS, WE CHANGED EVERY NUMBER TO MAKE IT A FAMOUS PERSON. IT COULDN'T HAVE GONE BETTER. I POCKET DIALED MY MOM CHRISTMAS MORNING. I SWEAR TO GOD, SHE LOOKED AT IT AND WENT -- [ GASP ] "HELLO, BARACK." [ LAUGHTER ] MY MOM -- MY MOM, GENUINELY BELIEVED THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAD CALLED HER. "HELLO, BARACK! I'VE GOT TO GO, LOVE. I GOT ELTON JOHN ON THE OTHER LINE." [ LAUGHTER ] I WILL NEVER TIRE OF TEASING MY MOM. I STILL GET GIDDY WHEN I GO HOME AND SEE HER SHOPPING LIST ON THE KITCHEN TABLE. FIND MY SELF GOING, "I'LL ADD A A FEW THINGS TO MOTHER'S LIST. HEROIN." [ LAUGHTER ] PATHETIC, BUT NOTHING MAKES ME HAPPIER THAN AN IMAGE OF MY MOM A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED IN A A SUPERMARKET. "GOT MY MILK, GOT MY POTATOES. WHAT'S THAT SAY? A BIG POT OF LUBE FOR MY SWINGERS NIGHT?" [ LAUGHTER ] WE HIT THE JACKPOT ONE YEAR. SHE ASKED A MAN IN THE SUPERMARKET WHETHER THEY SOLD CRYSTAL METH BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER WHETHER SHE PUT IT ON THE LIST OR NOT. [ LAUGHTER ] "EXCUSE ME, LOVE. YOU GOT ANY CRYSTAL METH? GOTTA GO, MY PHONE'S RINGING. HELLO, BEYONCE? STOP IT!" [ LAUGHTER ] OUR FAVORITE GAME TO PLAY, AND YOU HAVE TO DO THIS, MY FRIENDS, IS CALLED "THE MUR GAME." NOW, THE WAY IT WORKS, LIKE, YOUR DAD MIGHT SAY SOMETHING SUGGESTIVE. YOUR DAD MIGHT GO, "[ BLEEP ] THAT BACK DOOR'S A BIT STIFF." AND YOU HAVE TO GO, "MUR." [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, WE'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME FOR 20 YEARS. DOES MY MOM UNDERSTAND THE RULES? NO. [ LAUGHTER ] DOES IT STOP HER FROM JOINING IN? ABSOLUTELY NOT. THIS IS WHY I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN RAISED BY SUCH A JOY MONKEY. I SAID TO MY MOM THE OTHER DAY. I GO, "OY, DO YOU WANT A CUP OF TEA?" AND SHE HONESTLY LOOKED TO ME AND WENT, "MUR. [ LAUGHTER ] GOT YOU." "YOU DIDN'T GET ME, DID YOU, YOU FABULOUS DUMPLING. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S DO THIS ONE MORE TIME. IT HAS TO SOUND RUDE BUT NOT BE RUDE. HOW CAN A CUP OF TEA POSSIBLY BE RUDE?" AND MY MAGNIFICENT MOM LOOKED TO ME, WENT "I DON'T KNOW, RUSS. YOU CAN POUR IT UP YOUR ASS." [ LAUGHTER ] NOW. MUR. IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE RAISED BY A WOMAN LIKE THAT, IT'S A TREAT. TAKE HER PLACES. NOW, I'M QUITE FAMOUS IN THE U.K. I SAY THAT NOT TO SHOW OFF, BUT TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH JOY MY MOM TAKES. THE OTHER DAY WE'RE IN A CAR, RIGHT? A BLOKE GOT OUT OF HIS CAR, STUCK IN TRAFFIC, BLOKE GOT OUT OF HIS CAR. NOTICED ME, KNOCKED ON THE WINDOW, WENT, "EXCUSE ME. ARE YOU RUSSELL HOWARD? CAN I HAVE A PHOTO?" NOW THAT'S FAIRLY WEIRD. IT'S ABOUT EVEN STRANGER WHEN YOUR MOM IS NEXT TO YOU GOING, "HELP! [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S KIDNAPPED ME! HE MADE ME BUY CRYSTAL METH!" [ LAUGHTER ] SHE WASN'T DONE. I TOOK HER TO A PREMIERE. MY SISTER WAS IN A FILM. WE GET THERE, IT'S REALLY EXCITING, RED CARPET PHOTOS, REALLY COOL. EXCEPT THAT, HALFWAY THROUGH THIS FILM THAT MY SISTERS IN, IT HAPPENED, RIGHT? MY LITTLE SISTER HAS SEX WITH AN OLD MAN. SHE DIDN'T TELL US THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER SAT DOWN AND DRAWN UP A LIST OF THINGS YOU DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE. BUT I WOULD ARGUE AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST WOULD BE WATCHING YOUR SWEET ANGEL OF A LITTLE SISTER HAVE SEX WITH AN OLD MAN WHEN YOU'RE SAT NEXT TO YOUR MUM. [ LAUGHTER ] AND MY MUM LOOKED AT ME AND WENT, "MUR!" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: OH! THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT, BROTHER. THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT, MAN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] RUSSELL HOWARD! RIGHT THERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. MORE "THE TONIGHT SHOW" AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND. RUSSELL HOWARD! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
