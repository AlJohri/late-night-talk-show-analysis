Jimmy: SLANG.
I CAN TEACH YOU SOME.
Jimmy: HAS HE TAUGHT YOU SOME?
YES, 'CAUSE I'VE PICKED IT UP FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS.
Jimmy: HOW DO YOU KNOW COCKNEY SLANG? WHAT IS IT? TELLS ME IT'S WHAT THE MARKET TRADERS USE TO USE WITH EACH OTHER SO THEY COULD KIND OF GET AWAY WITH CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.
Jimmy: OH.
SO THEY WOULD KIND OF SPEAK OVER THE TOP OF THE CROWDS.
Jimmy: 'CAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL.
IT'S CALLED THE RHYMING SLANG.
Jimmy: IT'S LIKE A RHYMING SLANG. YEAH.
YOU CH WOULD MEAN, I LIKE YOU HAT. TIT FOR TAT, HAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, I DON'T GET IT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I LIKE YOUR TITTER.
I LIKE YOUR ONES AND TWOS, SHOES.

IT'S JUST ONES AND TWOS.
Jimmy: ONES AND TWOS YOU'RE WEARING TWO SHOES. ONE.
SHOES. 'CAUSE ONE SHOE RHYMES WITH ONES AND TWOS.
Jimmy: OH. OKAY.

Jimmy: HE'S MAKING THINGS UP. I GOT TO SAY, YOU ARE FANTASTIC IN THE MOVIE.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jimmy: YOU WERE GREAT. I WOULD THINK THE THING THAT THIS "MAD MAX" THING, I WAS SAYING THIS WHEN CHARLIZE WAS HERE, WHAT IT IS YOU GO INTO THEATER YOU BUY ONE TICKET, YOU GO, "HI I'M HERE TO SEE 'MAD MAX.'" THEY GO, "OKAY COME ON IN." THEY GRAB YOU BY YOUR SHIRT AND THEY GO -- AND THROW YOU BACK OUT AND THEY GO, "DID YOU ENJOY YOURSELF?" YOU GO, "YEAH I GUESS SO, THAT WAS PRETTY FUN." [ LAUGHTER ] "MAD MAX: FURY ROAD," OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S LIKE BEING IN A WASHING MACHINE FOR TWO HOURS.
Jimmy: IT IS INSANE. IT IS THE MOST THE HIGH OCTANE, CRAZY ACTION. I MEAN, IT'S ALL SHOT AND ALL FILMED --
IN NAMIBIA IN AFRICA.
Jimmy: IN AFRICA. HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE?
SIX MONTHS.
Jimmy: WOW. THAT COULD BE FUN. OR IT COULD BE --
IT WAS FUN AND IT WAS TOUGH. YOU'RE IN --
Jimmy: IS IT?
ANYWHERE THAT'S NOT HOME FOR SIX MONTHS IS TOUGH.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
AND WE SHOT IN THE DESERT AND WE LIVED IN THE DESERT. SO IT WASN'T LIKE WE WERE GOING BACK TO A FANCY HOTEL AND THERE'S NO BOO AT THE WEEKEND. [ LAUGHTER ] MASSAGE TO GO TO. YOU'RE IN, YOU KNOW IT WAS BACK TO BASICS. YOU'RE IN THE DESERT, YOU'RE IN AFRICA. AND IT WAS DEFINITELY BACK TO BASICS.

YEAH, WE -- YOU KNOW IT'S A A LOT OF FUN. A LOT OF THE CAST IS REALLY YOUNG.
Jimmy: SHE'S GREAT.
THE OTHER GIRLS AND I, WE WERE THE FIVE OF US SO WE ALL HAD A LOT OF FUN TOGETHER. THERE WAS AS MUCH DRAMA GOING ON OFF SET THAT WAS AS ON SET.
Jimmy: CRAZY, THAT'S PERFECT. BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE A A FANTASTIC. I THINK I CHECKED TODAY ON ROTTEN TOMATOES, 95% FRESH.
THAT IS PROBABLY THE ONLY TIME THAT I'LL EVER BE IN A A MOVIE LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: NO THAT'S NOT TRUE. NO YOU'RE FANTASTIC. AND THE OTHER THING, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SAYING, I AGREE WITH THEM, IS HOW IMPORTANT THE FEMALE ROLES ARE IN THIS MOVIE.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THEY'RE VERY -- THEY'RE EMPOWERED. THEY'RE NOT JUST THERE FOR FLUFF, BUT TO ACTUALLY HAVE REAL ROLES IN THIS MOVIE.
THAT'S BEEN THE COOLEST THING THROUGHOUT THE PRESS TOUR OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS TO SEE HOW THE MEDIA IS RESPONDING AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE THAT THIS FILM IS REALLY, YOU KNOW, A BIG PART OF IT IS ABOUT FEMALE EQUALITY AND YOU KNOW WOMEN, THE POWER OF WOMEN INSIDE OF THE HEART OF THE STORY.
