Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. YOU'RE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS THE SHOW. THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT TO WATCH, AND WE'VE GOT A BIG SHOW TONIGHT. I'M YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON. I'M GONNA START OFF WITH SOME GOOD NEWS FOR NEW YORKERS. YESTERDAY NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO ATTENDED A A GROUND-BREAKING CEREMONY TO REBUILD LAGUARDIA AIRPORT, AND CALLED THE AIRPORT THE FRONT DOOR TO NEW YORK. AS OPPOSED TO NOW, WHEN IT'S KNOWN AS THE GATES OF HELL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] I THINK THAT'S A NICER -- HAS A A BETTER RING TO IT.
Steve: TRUE. TRUE.
Jimmy: LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. I SAW THAT THE FIRST UNITED STATE OF WOMEN'S SUMMIT WAS JUST HELD IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA SAT DOWN WITH OPRAH WHERE SHE DISCUSSED HER FEELINGS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE STILL PRETTY HAPPY TOGETHER. TAKE A LOOK.
WATCHING MY HUSBAND WALK OFF OF MARINE ONE AND GO TO THE OVAL OFFICE. IT'S LIKE, MM!
DID HE ALWAYS HAVE THAT SWAG OR HAS HE GOTTEN SWAGGIER?
NO, HE -- HE WAS VERY SWAGALICIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: MEANWHILE, SASHA AND MALIA WERE LIKE, "EW!" [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S -- THAT'S SO GROSS!" SWAGALICIOUS IS OBAMA'S NEW SECRET SERVICE CODE NAME. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE, SWAGALICIOUS. THE BIG POLITICAL NEWS IS THAT THE PRIMARY SEASON IS OFFICIALLY OVER. THAT'S RIGHT, THE LAST -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I KNOW. THE LAST PRIMARY BEFORE THE CONVENTION TOOK PLACE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., YESTERDAY AND HILLARY CLINTON WAS THE WINNER. BUT GET THIS. BERNIE SANDERS STILL HASN'T DROPPED OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] AT THIS POINT, IT'S JUST WEIRD THAT HE'S STILL HANGING AROUND. SPEAKING OF WHICH, JAY LENO IS MY GUEST TONIGHT ON THE SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, DONALD TRUMP IS STILL THE NOMINEE, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS BUT HERMAN CAIN WAS INTRODUCING HIM AT A RALLY TODAY. OR AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE WAS DOING. LOOK AT THIS.
AWW, SHUCKY DUCKY! [ LAUGHTER ] THIS SOUNDS LIKE A SHUCKY DUCKY KIND OF CROWD ON A SHUCKY DUCKY KIND OF DAY. HERE TO SUPPORT AN AWW SHUCKY DUCKY KIND OF CANDIDATE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WHAT IS GOING -- WHAT IS GOING ON? [ APPLAUSE ] OH, SHUCKY DUCKY! HE'S MAKING THAT HIS CATCH PHRASE. IN FACT, HERMAN CAIN'S EVEN DROPPED A NEW SINGLE CALLED "SHUCKY DUCKY."

ACCORDING TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, THE MOST POPULAR BABY NAMES IN 2016, NOAH AND EMMA. LEAST POPULAR BABY NAMES? DONALD AND HILLARY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOW, HILLARY -- HILLARY CLINTON SAYS SHE IS THE MOST TRANSPARENT CANDIDATE IN MODERN HISTORY. HOW MANY CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH HER? JUST CURIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] UH-OH, MORE PROBLEMS FOR HILLARY CLINTON. YOU KNOW, BILL HAS BEEN OUT CAMPAIGNING FOR HER, AND I -- I DON'T THINK HE'S HELPING. LIKE LAST WEEK IN SAN DIEGO, BILL STOPPED TO KISS A BABY, WHICH IS USUALLY OKAY. EXCEPT THE KID WAS BREAST FEEDING AT THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT MADE IT -- MADE IT AWKWARD. [ APPLAUSE ] MADE IT AWKWARD. I'VE BEEN ENJOYING DONALD TRUMP'S NEW REALITY SHOW, "THE AMAZING RACIST." [ LAUGHTER ] ANYBODY WATCHING THAT? WELL, TRUMP IS STILL REFUSING TO TAKE BACK WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE JUDGE. YOU KNOW THE JUDGE WITH A A MEXICAN SURNAME? IN FACT, TRUMP IS THREATENING TO HAVE THE JUDGE DEPORTED BACK TO INDIANA. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] LOOK AT THIS. ACCORDING -- ACCORDING TO A A POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR, ALL OF DONALD TRUMP'S SPEECHES ARE GIVEN AT A FIFTH GRADE LEVEL OR BELOW. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND TODAY TRUMP SAID THE PROFESSOR WHO DID THE STUDY WAS A DOODY HEAD. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] ACTUALLY, DID YOU KNOW THIS? NOW, THIS IS FASCINATING. THERE'S ACTUALLY A DATING SITE FOR TRUMP SUPPORTERS CALLED TRUMPSINGLES.COM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE SOMETIMES SCREWING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS JUST NOT ENOUGH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. LITTLE HANDS ACCEPTED. AND AS JIMMY SAID, BERNIE SANDERS STILL NOT CONCEDING. BERNIE SAYS HE IS THE MOST ANTI-FOSSIL FUEL OF ANY OF THE CANDIDATES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WELL OF COURSE HE IS, THAT'S CAUSE HE'S THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO IS AN ACTUAL FOSSIL. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS WHY THAT IS. [ APPLAUSE ] LISTEN TO THIS. BERNIE SANDERS -- BERNIE SANDERS STILL UPSET BECAUSE HE SAYS HIS FUNDRAISING DINNERS DIDN'T RAISE AS MUCH MONEY AS HILLARY CLINTON'S. WELL, OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T. NOBODY WANTS TO EAT DINNER AT 4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON. [ LAUGHTER ] HUH, HOW MUCH CREAM OF WHEAT CAN YOU EAT? PLEASE! [ APPLAUSE ] AND DURING THE INTERVIEW LAST WEEK, BERNIE SANDERS ADMITTED TO SMOKING MARIJUANA AS A YOUNG MAN. YEAH. HE SAID IT IMPAIRED HIS PERCEPTION AND IT DISTORTED HIS THINKING BUT HE EXPECTS THAT TO CLEAR UP EVENTUALLY. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] PRESIDENT OBAMA -- PRESIDENT OBAMA DOING WELL. APPROVAL RATING 51%. 51%. THE OTHER 49% ARE TAXPAYERS. YEAH. BUT THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT I TELL YOU, JIMMY, THE ECONOMY IS BAD. THE ECONOMY IS BAD, GUYS.

ONE DAY I WAS WORKING IN RENO. I WAS MAKING NO MONEY, AND I WAS FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF. I USED TO EAT EVERY DAY THE 99 CENT BUFFET AT ONE OF THE CHEAP CASINOS.
Jimmy: SURE, ABSOLUTELY.
SO, I SAW A SIDE OF SHOW BUSINESS. I WENT INTO THIS CASINO. IN THERE, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CASINO THERE'S A BOXING RING. "WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?"
