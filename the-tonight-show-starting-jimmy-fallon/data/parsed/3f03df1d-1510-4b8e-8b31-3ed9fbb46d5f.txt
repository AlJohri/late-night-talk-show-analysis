BUT FIRST, LET'S GET TO SOME NEWS HERE. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS GIVING AN INTERVIEW RECENTLY. AND GET THIS. HE SAID THAT HE FELT THAT JOE BIDEN WOULD BE A GOOD PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN ASKED WHY, HE WAS LIKE "BECAUSE HE'D MAKE ME LOOK AMAZING." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S THE REAL TRUTH. I MEAN -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOT GOING TO LIE. SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS. NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE'S ECONOMIC ADVISOR -- [ CHEERS ] WELL, HIS ECONOMIC ADVISOR HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS STEPPING DOWN. [ AUDIENCE OHS ] HE JUST HAS TO WAIT FOR CHRISTIE TO GET OFF THE SEESAW FIRST. [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW IT'S GOING TO HURT! JUST DO IT! JUST GET OFF SLOWLY. I KNOW IT'S GOING TO KILL! THAT'S RIGHT. CHRIS CHRISTIE'S ECONOMIC ADVISOR IS STEPPING DOWN AFTER ALMOST FOUR YEARS WITH THE GOVERNOR. HE SAID, I'M TIRED OF REMINDING HIM THAT GUAC IS EXTRA AND THAT I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE. [ LAUGHTER ] GUAC IS ALWAYS EXTRA. YOU KNOW THAT.
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE THAT TATTOOED ON YOUR LOWER BACK.
Steve: YEAH, I DO. "GUAC IS EXTRA." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL -- [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DO I KNOW THAT AGAIN? [ LAUGHTER ] HEY -- EDWARD SNOWDEN IS BACK WITH YET ANOTHER SPYING SCANDAL. THIS GUY AGAIN. IN A NEW INTERVIEW, SNOWDEN REVEALED THAT NSA EMPLOYEES REGULARLY PASS AROUND NUDE PICTURES OF PEOPLE THEY SPY ON.

IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THE WORST YOU'VE SEEN. BRATWURST." [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOOD NEWS OR NOT. BUT I HEARD THAT ROB FORD'S NEPHEW IS PLANNING TO RUN FOR A A SEAT ON TORONTO'S CITY COUNCIL. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. HE HAS A VERY INTERESTING CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. "I'M ADOPTED." AND THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] -- GET TO THE POINT. LET PEOPLE HEAR WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR. THEY'RE GOING TO ASK.
Steve: YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: OF COURSE, ROB FORD JUST RETURNED FROM REHAB TO HIS JOB AS MAYOR OF TORONTO. AND DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK, FORD SAID HE FEELS AS HEALTHY AS A HORSE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WELL -- [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY THAT ROB FORD HAS BEEN COMPARED TO A A HORSE. SO LET'S BREAK IT DOWN IN TONIGHT'S "TALE OF THE TAPE."
Steve: "TALE OF THE TAPE." HORSE VERSUS FORD!
Jimmy: WOW. FIRST UP -- [ LAUGHTER ] I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW. IT'S A WEIRD PICTURE OF THAT HORSE. [ LAUGHTER ] FIRST UP, WE HAVE HEIGHT. HORSES ARE FIVE FEET. ROB FORD IS TWO FEET LYING FACE DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT, WE HAVE WEAKNESSES. HORSES HAVE HOOF-IN-MOUTH DISEASE. ROB FORD HAS COKE AND NOSE DISEASE. VERY, VERY DIFFERENT. [ LAUGHTER ]

Steve: VERY SIMILAR. BUT DIFFERENT. AND FINALLY, THERE'S RIDDEN BY. HORSES ARE RIDDEN BY JOCKEYS. ROB FORD IS RIDDEN BY LATE NIGHT COMEDIANS. THERE YOU GO. I HAVE TO DO MY JOB. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S MY JOB. I HAVE TO DO THAT. I'M SORRY. DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL, ROB.

Jimmy: THAT IS ALSO INCORRECT.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU GUYS BOTH HAVE IT WAY WRONG. I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE, JIMMY.

Jimmy: YOU JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST GOING INTO A THING.
I'M GONNA GO BE IN A MOVIE, YOU KNOW.
Jimmy: AND SO EVERY SUMMER OR SOMETHING, YOU WOULD FILM?
YEAH, IT WAS NEVER, LIKE, A A SET TIME OF YEAR, SPECIFICALLY. BUT, IT GENERALLY IT WAS IN THE SUMMER, KIND OF.
Jimmy: HOW DID HE PULL THIS OFF? HOW DID YOU -- DID YOU HIDE IN A CAVE OR SOMETHING? DID HE MAKE YOU SIGN -- DID YOU DO ANY OTHER JOBS?
NO, I MEAN, I WAS STILL GOING TO AUDITIONS FOR A LITTLE WHILE THE FIRST FEW YEARS. BUT I THINK AT A CERTAIN POINT, I DON'T KNOW. I FELT LIKE IT DESERVED ALL OF MY ATTENTION, I GUESS. BUT THERE WAS NO -- THEY DIDN'T SWEAR ME TO SECRECY OR ANYTHING.
Jimmy: YOU WERE JUST A COOL DUDE.
I MEAN -- PEOPLE HAVE THIS IMPRESSION THAT WE KEPT IT UNDER WRAPS. WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO TALK TO PRESS ABOUT IT. BUT WE TOLD ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AND THE TRUTH IS THAT NO ONE CARED. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS LIKE OH, WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS MOVIE IN 12 YEARS. AND THE STORY IS JUST KIND OF THIS FAMILY. AND THEY'RE JUST LIKE, "OH, OKAY, GOOD."
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT, EVERYONE IN THE MOVIE, TOO -- IT'S NOT JUST YOU AND ETHAN AND LORELEI, IT'S EVERYONE. LIKE, EXTRAS, AND SMALLER ROLES AGE AS WELL DURING THE MOVIE.
Jimmy: DID RICHARD HAVE A A SCRIPT?
NO. NO, NO.
Jimmy: HOW COULD YOU?
I MEAN HE HAD --
Jimmy: HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN UNLESS HE'S NOSTRADAMUS, OR SOMETHING. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 12 YEARS IN THE FUTURE.
I MEAN, I THINK HE DOES HAVE SOME MYSTICAL POWERS. BUT, YEAH. HE HAD -- HE HAD A STRUCTURE. HE DEFINITELY KNEW THE BASIC POINTS THE FAMILY WOULD GO THROUGH. AND THE CHANGES, AND CERTAINLY WHERE IT WAS GOING TO END UP AT THE END. HE ALWAYS WANTED MASON TO GO TO COLLEGE.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT WAS KIND OF JUST WORKED UP AS IT WENT ALONG.
Jimmy: -- YOU LIVING YOUR NORMAL LIFE. AS YOU. COULD YOU GROW YOUR HAIR? COULD YOU GET A TATTOO? COULD YOU GET YOUR EARS PIERCED?
YEAH, ACTUALLY MY EAR'S PIERCED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE MOVIE. AND I CALLED RICHARD AND ASKED HIM AND HE WAS KIND OF LIKE, "OKAY, DO YOUR THING." AND A LOT OF THOSE HAIRCUTS WERE MY HAIRCUTS.
Jimmy: I WAS GOING TO SAY, 'CAUSE THERE'S ONE WHERE YOU LOOK JUST LIKE NIKOALI FROM THE STROKES. IT'S REALLY COOL, LONG HAIR. BUT THAT'S --
THAT'S ME, YEAH.
Jimmy: THAT'S YOU, THAT'S ELLAR. THAT'S YOU BEING YOU.
THAT WAS ALWAYS KIND OF THE IDEA, TO JUST HAVE IT KIND OF GO WHERE I WENT. EVEN, WHEN I HAD ACNE, HE KIND OF MADE A POINT TO NOT COVER IT UP. BECAUSE MOST TEENAGERS HAVE ACNE AT SOME POINT.
Jimmy: I NOTICED THAT AT ONE POINT. [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT, I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL.
IT'S REAL.
Jimmy: I THOUGHT THE MAKE-UP AND SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE REALLY GOOD FOR THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU WATCH THIS AND I SAID TO MYSELF -- YOU THINK SO MANY THOUGHTS WHEN YOU SEE THIS. I WAS TALKING TO ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS TODAY, I SAID "HOW MANY STUPID, DUMB THINGS WE'VE DONE GROWING UP IN OUR LIVES --AND DANGEROUS THINGS."
YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T REALIZE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU IN THE FUTURE. YOU GO, "OH, MY GOSH, WE DID ALL THESE DUMB -- SOME SCENES WERE I'M LIKE AH, DON'T, DON' --
I KNOW, YOU EXPECT IT. YOU EXPECT SOMETHING BAD TO HAPPEN.
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU'RE LIKE DON'T HANG OUT WITH THOSE KIDS. I WOULDN'T DO THAT. I FEEL LIKE SUCH A DAD. I WAS LIKE "DON'T' GO THERE EVER AGAIN!" IT'S JUST FASCINATING TO WATCH IT ALL HAPPEN. AND ETHAN HAWKE, YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT GUY.
HE'S INCREDIBLE.
Jimmy: HE'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE. HE'S DOING SCENES AND HE IS SUCH A GOOD ACTOR HE MAKES IT LOOK SO EASY.
HE'S A GOOD DAD.
Jimmy: HE'S A GREAT DAD IN THIS MOVIE, YEAH. BUT I WAS -- IS IT WEIRD TO LOOK AT YOURSELF AND GO, OH, THAT'S MY -- DID YOU SEE FOOTAGE AS YOU WERE GOING THROUGH?
NO, I DIDN'T SEE ANY UNTIL OF IT UNTIL THE END. RICK GAVE ME A DISK AND WAS LIKE "YOU SHOULD PROBABLY WATCH THIS ALONE THE FIRST TIME."
Jimmy: YEAH.
WHICH WAS WISE, I THINK. IT WAS QUITE AN EXPERIENCE TO SEE. I MEAN, I'VE SEEN IT NEARLY 10 TIMES NOW, AND IT'S STARTING TO BECOME EASIER, BUT IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL.
Jimmy: THERE'S SCENES THAT ARE ALMOST A LITTLE CRINGE WORTHY, ALMOST LIKE SEEING A A REALLY WEIRD YEARBOOK PHOTO OF YOURSELF.
I MEAN, THERE DEFINITELY ARE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I WAS TRYING TO GROW A MUSTACHE.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S A PRETTY BAD PHOTO. BUT YOU TURN OUT YOU.
YEAH.
Jimmy: WHICH IS AMAZING AND AWESOME. AND I JUST LOVE THE WHOLE RIDE YOU TOOK US ON. I CAN'T EVEN RECOMMEND THE MOVIE ANY MORE. AND YOU DID SUCH A GREAT JOB. I MEAN, 12 YEARS. YOU DID SOMETHING NO ONE'S DONE. THAT'S GREAT. CONGRATULATIONS. I WANT TO SHOW A CLIP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ELLAR COLTRANE IN "BOYHOOD." TAKE A LOOK AT A CLIP.
THIS IS THE BEST S'MORE I'VE EVER MADE IN MY LIFE.
DAD.
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS ABSOLUTE PEAK. LOOK AT THIS.
DAD.
HONEY BROWN, NO BURN. LOOK AT THAT, HUH? COULD SELL THAT IN THE STORE.
THAT'S LIKE ADVERTISEMENT WORTHY.
ADVERTISEMENT QUALITY.
YES.
YOU THINK THEY EVER WILL MAKE ANOTHER "STAR WARS"?
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, I THINK IF WE WERE TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE, THAT THE PERIOD WHERE THE END IS SET IS WHERE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE. 'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING AFTER, REALLY.
YEAH. "RETURN OF THE JEDI," IT'S OVER.
AT THE END.
YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DO THERE.
YOU CAN TURN HAN SOLO INTO A A SITH LORD?
YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
