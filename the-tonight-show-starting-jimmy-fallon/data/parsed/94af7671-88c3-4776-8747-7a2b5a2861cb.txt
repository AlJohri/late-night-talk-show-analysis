Questlove: 223 MALI!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, MY GOODNESS. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE SHOW! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LOOKING GOOD OUT THERE. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. HIGGINS, WELCOME TO THE SHOW. YOU GUYS READY FOR A BIG SHOW TONIGHT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOING TO BE FUN.
Steve: COME ON.
Jimmy: IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD SHOW. FIRST, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT MICHELLE OBAMA IS GOING TO JAPAN AND CAMBODIA THIS MONTH TO ENCOURAGE EDUCATION FOR GIRLS. AS OPPOSED TO THE PROGRAM WE HAVE HERE IN AMERICA THAT ENCOURAGES GIRLS TO GET AN EDUCATION, "THE BACHELOR." [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE PROGRAM. I LOVE THE "THE BACHELOR." OF COURSE THE BIG STORY OUT OF WASHINGTON IS ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S SPEECH TO CONGRESS WHERE HE WAS VERY CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT OBAMA. AND SO REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY GAVE NETANYAHU A STANDING OVATION. [ APPLAUSE ] CRAZY. NORMALLY, THE ONLY TIME REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN CLAP THAT HARD IS WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO TURN OFF THEIR LIGHTS. CLAP ON. CLAP OFF! [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] CLAP ON. CLAP OFF. BUT NOT EVERYONE WAS HAPPY. IN FACT, A BUNCH OF DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY GOT TOGETHER TO GIVE A A REBUTTAL. AND IT COULD JUST BE ME, BUT THEY ALL SEEMED A LITTLE FLUSTERED. CHECK THIS OUT. WATCH.
THE MAJORITY OF THE IR -- ISRAELI PEOPLE.
THAT'S WHAT PRES -- PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU WAS DOING.
AND PRIME MINISTER NETANYASHU -- NETANYAHU SHOULDN'T HAVE ACCEPTED THIS INVITATION.
THIS NATION IS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN -- ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN.
JUST LAST YEAR THE PRIME MINISTER SAID -- [ LAUGHTER ] FROM THE BOTTOM? YEAH. NO. ANYWAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: UH, PRIME MINISTER -- NET -- PRIME MINISTER NESSIN -- EVEN JOHN TRAVOLTA WAS LIKE, "IT'S BENJAMIN NETANYAHU." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. DURING AN INTERVIEW THIS WEEK PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT HE WANTS THE UNITED STATES TO ESTABLISH AN EMBASSY IN CUBA BY APRIL. [ CHEERS ] WHEN ASKED IF CUBA WOULD ESTABLISH AN EMBASSY HERE, HE SAID, "WE ALREADY GOT ONE. IT'S CALLED MIAMI." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: HEY-OH! HEY!
Jimmy: I SAW THAT JOE BIDEN WILL SPEAK TO THE NATION'S LARGEST GAY RIGHTS GROUP DURING A HUMAN RIGHTS CONVENTION ON FRIDAY. AND THEN ON SATURDAY HE'S SCHEDULED TO SPEAK TO THEM AGAIN TO APOLOGIZE FOR WHATEVER HE SAID IN FRIDAY'S SPEECH. LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT THIS WEEKEND. [ APPLAUSE ] SOME MORE POLITICAL NEWS. DURING AN INTERVIEW THIS WEEK BILLIONAIRE WARREN BUFFETT SAID THAT HE WOULD BET MONEY ON HILLARY CLINTON BECOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [ CHEERS ] THEN HE SAID OF COURSE I'M A A BILLIONAIRE, SO I'D PROBABLY BET MONEY ON A TURTLE BEING ABLE TO MOONWALK. I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT MONEY. I'LL BET ANYTHING. [ APPLAUSE ] IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME. I'M RICH.
Jimmy: DID YOU GUYS SEE THIS? YESTERDAY REPUBLICAN SENATOR TED CRUZ INTRODUCED YET ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO OBAMACARE CALLED THE HEALTH CARE CHOICES ACT. WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BUY INSURANCE FROM DIFFERENT STATES. WHEN THEY HEARD THAT, EVEN PEOPLE STILL FIGHTING ABOUT THE COLOR OF THE DRESS WERE LIKE, "DUDE, MOVE ON." PLEASE? IT ALREADY HAPPENED. [ APPLAUSE ] WE ALREADY FIGURED -- IT'S OBAMACARE. WE'RE DEALING WITH IT. A LITTLE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS HERE. I HEARD MAC COSMETICS IS LAUNCHING A LINE OF MAKEUP INSPIRED BY THE NEW LIVE ACTION CINDERELLA MOVIE. BECAUSE WHAT GIRL DOESN'T WANT MAKEUP INSPIRED BY A STORY WHERE THE WOMAN TURNS INTO AN UGLY LOSER AT MIDNIGHT? IT'S JUST A GREAT -- [ APPLAUSE ] GREAT STORY. THIS MADE ME LAUGH. POLICE IN NEBRASKA ARRESTED A A MAN AFTER THEY PULLED HIM OVER AND FOUND A CONTAINER OF WEED MARKED "NOT WEED." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OR AS THE GUY PUT IT, "OH, THAT'S WHERE IT WAS. I DIDN'T LOOK THERE BECAUSE IT SAID 'NOT WEED.' SO I THOUGHT -- [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS THINKING THAT --"
Steve: IT'S NO TWEED. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: NO TWEED.
Steve: YEAH, MAN.
Jimmy: I DON'T LIKE IT, YEAH.
Steve: A GABARDINE FACTORY.
Jimmy: SPEAKING OF MARIJUANA, I JUST READ ABOUT A A D.E.A. AGENT IN UTAH WHO'S WARNING THE STATE AGAINST PASSING A MEDICAL MARIJUANA BILL BECAUSE IT COULD CAUSE RABBITS NEAR MARIJUANA FARMS TO BECOME ADDICTED TO POT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND LOSE THEIR NATURAL INSTINCTS. [ LAUGHTER ] RABBITS WERE LIKE, "YOU MEAN OUR NATURAL TENDENCY TO EAT AND HAVE SEX AND ACT SUPER PARANOID ALL THE TIME?" YEAH, OKAY. WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT. [ APPLAUSE ] WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT BY -- [ APPLAUSE ] A D.E.A. AGENT SAID PASSING A A MEDICAL MARIJUANA BILL COULD CAUSE RABBITS TO BECOME ADDICTED TO POT. POT FARMERS OBVIOUSLY WERE UPSET ABOUT THIS BUT SURPRISINGLY SO WERE RABBITS. HERE'S WHAT SOME OF THEM HAD TO SAY. FIRST THE ENERGIZER BUNNY SAID, "COULD BECOME ADDICTED? LOOK AT ME. I WEAR FLIP-FLOPS, SUNGLASSES AND I'M BASICALLY MY OWN NEVERENDING DRUM CIRCLE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NEXT, THUMPER SAID, "I SOLD OUT BAMBI'S MOM FOR A DIME BAG. WHAT HAVE I BECOME?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AWFUL.
Steve: AWFUL.
Jimmy: AWFUL STORY.
Steve: WOW.
Jimmy: AND THE EASTER BUNNY SAID, "I'VE GOT THE MUNCHIES SO BAD I COULD BITE THE HEAD OFF A A CHOCOLATE ME." I MEAN THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A MIND BENDER RIGHT THERE. AND FINALLY ROGER RABBIT SAID, "I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE I'M MORE OF A COCAINE GUY." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND THERE YOU GO. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS!

YO! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT'S UP, GUYS? HOW ARE YOU DOING? ALL RIGHT. I JUST -- I CAN'T GET OVER HOW MUCH BETTER-LOOKING ZOE IS AND I -- ZOE KRAVITZ IS WAY -- HAS ANYONE ELSE NOTICED THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, SHE LOOKS LIKE ZOE KRAVITZ. I LOOK LIKE DANNY DEVITO'S FOOT. [ LAUGHTER ] HAS ANYONE ELSE NOTICED THAT? YOU KNOW, THE WORLD HAS GONE CRAZY. THE WORLD HAS GONE NUTS. AND I BLAME IT ALL ON THE KARDASHIAN WOMEN. [ LAUGHTER ] I DO. YOU COULD BLAME IT -- YOU COULD TRACE EVERY NUTTY THING THAT'S GONE ON BACK TO THE KARDASHIAN WOMEN. FOR ANY MAN WHO LIVES IN THAT HOUSE I THINK STARTS TO LOSE IT A BIT. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE LAMAR ODOM WAS A GREAT BASKETBALL PLAYER. LIVED IN THE HOUSE FOR A FEW YEARS. STARTED SMOKING A LOT OF CRACK. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I DON'T BLAME THE GUY FOR THAT. DID YOU EVER HEAR THOSE CHICKS TALK? I'D SMOKE A LOT OF CRACK. [ LAUGHTER ] AS A MATTER OF FACT, IF I WAS A A DOCTOR AND LAMAR ODOM CAME TO ME AND SAID "LISTEN, I'M LIVING IN THE KARDASHIAN HOUSE," I'D SAY, "HAVE YOU TRIED SMOKING CRACK?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW BRUCE JENNER HAS LIVED -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- IN THE KARDASHIAN HOUSE FOR A WHILE. AND HE'S -- YOU KNOW, HE'S DOING HIS OWN THING AS WELL. [ LAUGHTER ] I COULD JUST SEE BRUCE JENNER AND LAMAR ODOM MEETING IN THAT HOUSE AT LIKE 3:00 IN THE MORNING, IN THE KITCHEN BY THEMSELVES. AND BRUCE JENNER'S HAVING SOME MILK AND LAMAR ODOM IS HAVING SOME CRACK. [ LAUGHTER ] AND LAMAR SAYS, "BRUCE, I'VE GOT TO OPEN UP TO SOMEBODY. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, MAN. THESE GIRLS ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY. I'VE GOT TO MAKE -- I'VE GOT TO MAKE A CONFESSION. I'M SMOKING CRACK." [ LAUGHTER ] BRUCE JENNER WOULD LOOK AT HIM AND GO, "HEY, MAN, LISTEN, THAT SUCKS BUT WAIT TILL YOU HEAR WHAT I'M UP TO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] REMEMBER WHERE MY PENIS USED TO BE?" [ LAUGHTER ] SOMETIMES, WOMEN CAN DRIVE YOU CRAZY. THAT'S WHAT JENNER SAID TO HIMSELF. SOMETIMES WOMEN CAN DRIVE YOU CRAZY. BASICALLY, WHAT HE SAID WAS, "LISTEN, IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM, JOIN THEM." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT TO BE A COMIC, THOUGH, IN THE DAYS OF TWITTER, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TWITTER BEFORE HERE. WITH KIM KARDASHIAN, PARIS HILTON. THEY LIKE TO HIRE COMEDIANS TO WRITE TWEETS FOR THEM SO THEY SEEM WITTY. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO PRETEND YOU'RE THEM. YOU CAN'T LET PEOPLE KNOW IT'S NOT THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO SEEM WITTY. MY AGENTS CALLED ME LAST YEAR AND SAID, "WOULD YOU CONSIDER EVER DOING THAT? WRITING TWEETS FOR KIM KARDASHIAN? BUT HAVE TO PRETEND YOU'RE HER. NO ONE COULD KNOW IT'S NOT HER. BUT SHE HAS TO SEEM WITTY." AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY. BUT THEN I SAID NO BECAUSE I'M NOT GOOD WITH TECHNOLOGY. AND I SAID TO MYSELF, "WHAT IF I ACCIDENTALLY TWEET SOMETHING ABOUT MY LIFE ON KIM KARDASHIAN'S TWITTER ACCOUNT?" [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK I'D GET FIRED PRETTY QUICK. YOU KNOW LIKE, "HEY, GUYS, YOU'RE AT KIM KARDASHIAN. AND GUESS WHAT? A HOOKER JUST THREW UP IN MY NUTRIBULLET. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M JUST KIDDING. I DON'T HAVE A NUTRIBULLET." [ LAUGHTER ] TODAY'S MUSIC, I DON'T GET. I WAS AN OZZY OSBOURNE GUY. YOU KNOW, LIKE BLACK SABBATH AND STUFF LIKE THAT. CLASSIC ROCK. YOU KNOW. AND THEY SUED ALL THOSE GUYS FOR BEING, YOU KNOW, ANTI-WHATEVER. RELIGION AND STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT THERE'S A GREAT DOCUMENTARY ABOUT OZZY OSBOURNE NOW ON SHOWTIME. SIMILAR SITUATION. OZZY OSBOURNE'S WIFE AND KIDS WON'T STOP SHOPPING. SO HE HAS TO KEEP TOURING THE WORLD SINGING THOSE OLD SONGS. AND IT'S KIND OF SAD. THERE'S A GREAT SHOWTIME DOCUMENTARY. IT STARTS OUT YOU SEE HIS WIFE AND KIDS SHOPPING. LIKE AT SOME EXPENSIVE STORE. AND THEN THEY CUT TO OZZY OSBOURNE ON STAGE IN BERLIN GOING LIKE -- ♪ MR. CROWLEY [ LAUGHTER ] LEND ME YOUR EAR ♪ ♪ MY WIFE WON'T STOP SHOPPING ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE. I THINK HE'S ON LITHIUM BECAUSE I'VE DONE LITHIUM BEFORE. AND WHEN YOU'RE ON LITHIUM, YOU ALWAYS WALK AROUND LIKE YOU'RE AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO WALK INTO WET PAINT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT WHEN'S SOMEONE GOING TO SUE SOME OF THE MODERN ACTS? A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, JAY-Z AND ALICIA KEYS HAD A GREAT SONG OUT CALLED "EMPIRE STATE OF MIND." GREAT, GREAT SONG. GREAT SONG. BUT WHEN IS SOMEONE GOING TO SUE HIM FOR THOSE LYRICS? I MEAN, LISTEN TO IT. IT'S BASICALLY A BLUEPRINT ON HOW TO BE A COCAINE DEALER IN NEW YORK CITY. [ LAUGHTER ] WITH ALICIA KEYS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL VOICE. SHE JUST CUTS IN. AND I LOVE JAY-Z. HE'S A KING. AND I LOVE ALICIA KEYS. SHE'S GOT A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. BUT IT'S KIND OF INAPPROPRIATE. HERE'S HOW THAT SONG GOES.
