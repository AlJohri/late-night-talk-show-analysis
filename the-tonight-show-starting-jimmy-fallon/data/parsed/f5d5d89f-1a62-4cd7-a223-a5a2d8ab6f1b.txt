Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." TONIGHT, JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- AZIZ ANSARI TAYLOR SCHILLING MUSICAL GUEST, ADAM LAMBERT AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW.
Questlove: 280, MARYLAND!
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HEY! HI! HI, EVERYBODY. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT! THIS IS IT! YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. OF COURSE, IT'S THE MOVIE "JURASSIC WORLD." IT HAD A HUGE WEEKEND, MAKING OVER $500 MILLION WORLDWIDE. FOR THE BIGGEST OPENING WEEKEND OF ALL TIME. [ CHEERS ] YEAH, $500 MILLION. THE DINOSAURS WERE LIKE, "YEAH, WHATEVER, AS LONG AS IT DID BETTER THAN THOSE ASTEROID MOVIES." PAYBACK, BITCHES! [ LAUGHTER ] IN OTHER NEWS, HILLARY CLINTON -- I READ THAT ALMOST 5,000 PEOPLE ATTENDED HILLARY'S OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN KICKOFF THIS WEEKEND RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. RIGHT. 5,000 PEOPLE. BUT SINCE IT'S NEW YORK, MOST OF THEM JUST SAW A LINE AND GOT IN IT. WHAT IS THIS? [ LAUGHTER ] IS THIS THE NEW iPHONE? [ LAUGHTER ] I GOT THE iPHONE, BABY! THAT'S RIGHT. HILLARY CLINTON OFFICIALLY KICKED OFF HER CAMPAIGN THIS WEEKEND. WE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T SHOW YOU THE WHOLE THING, BUT WE WERE ABLE TO CAN CONDENSE IT DOWN SO YOU STILL GET THE GIST.
I'M GOING TO BE PRESIDENT. AND NO ONE ELSE STANDS A A CHANCE.
Jimmy: THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND GET THIS, IN AN INTERVIEW LAST, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH SAYS THAT HE DOESN'T MISS BEING PRESIDENT, BUT HE DOES MISS HAVING SOMEONE GET HIM COFFEE EVERYDAY. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THEN DICK CHENEY SAID, "ACTUALLY, THAT WAS JUST MICROWAVED YOO-HOO." [ LAUGHTER ] COFFEE MADE HIM TOO HYPER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT THIS WEEKEND WAS MITT ROMNEY'S ANNUAL E2 SUMMIT. THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TRY TO WIN SUPPORT FROM SOME BIG MONEY DONORS. I HEARD THAT IT INCLUDES EVENTS LIKE HIKING WITH THE ROMNEY'S, FLAG FOOTBALL WITH MARCO RUBIO, AND SKEET SHOOTING WITH LINDSEY GRAHAM. IT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE SUMMER CAMP. I GUESS THAT'S WHY -- I GUESS THAT'S WHY SOME OF THE CANDIDATES WERE EVEN WRITING LETTERS HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH. WE HAVE A FEW EXAMPLES. CHECK THIS. HERE IS ONE FROM RAND PAUL. HE WROTE, "WE WERE SITTING AROUND THE CAMPFIRE, TELLING GHOST STORIES, WHEN JOHN McCAIN WALKED OUT OF THE WOODS. I ALMOST CRAPPED MY PANTS." [ LAUGHTER ] FRIGHTENING VISUAL. HERE'S ONE FROM RICK SANTORUM. HE WROTE, "I WAS SO HOT LAST NIGHT I ALMOST TOOK OFF MY PAJAMA SWEATER VEST. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I DIDN'T." I ALMOST DID.
Steve: ALMOST.
Jimmy: FINALLY, HERE'S ON FROM BOBBY JINDAL. HE WROTE, "HAVEN'T SLEPT MUCH BECAUSE I GOT BOTTOM BUNK. CHRIS CHRISTIE GOT TOP BUNK. EACH CREAK FEELS LIKE THIS COULD BE IT." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: COME ON! THAT'S NOT TRUE.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW -- NONE OF THEM ARE HOME SICK. OF COURSE, ANOTHER BIG STORY IS THE NBA FINALS. LAST NIGHT, THE WARRIORS PULLED AWAY FROM THE CAVS LATE IN THE GAME, THANKS TO -- [ CHEERS ] THAT WAS AMAZING. A BUNCH OF THREE POINTERS FROM STEPH CURRY. THIS GUY IS AMAZING. THESE WEREN'T JUST NORMAL SHOTS. THESE WERE LIKE, VERY HIGH DEGREES OF DIFFICULTY, THESE SHOTS. IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE IS PLAYING IN A VIDEO GAME, WHEN I WAS WATCHING. BUT IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY, I THINK HE WAS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
HE'S ON FIRE! RAZZLE-DAZZLE. PUT'S IT UP FOR THREE. COUNT IT. THE THREE IS GOOD. THROWS THE BOMB FROM LONG RANGE. THIS GUY IS HEATING UP. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ON FIRE! STEPH CURRY ON FIRE!
Steve: OUTRAGEOUS!
Jimmy: AND THIS IS JUST A A CRAZY STORY. THIS WOMAN RACHAEL DOLEZAL UP IN SPOKANE, WASHINGTON -- DO YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT THIS? YEAH. WELL, APPARENTLY SHE WAS THE PRESIDENT THE SPOKANE CHAPTER OF THE NAACP, BUT WAS EXPOSED AS A WHITE WOMAN WHO WS JUST PRETENDING TO BE BLACK. NOW OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET, ESPECIALLY HER WHITE FRIENDS WHO THOUGHT THEY HAD AT LEAST ONE BLACK FRIEND. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY'RE LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME RIGHT NOW? RACHAEL IS A WHITE WOMAN?" "I GOT A BUNCH OF BLACK FRIENDS. I GOT -- WHAT'S THAT?" "YOU ARE JOKING ME RIGHT NOW." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. RACHAEL DOLEZAL, THE PRESIDENT OF THE NAACP IN SPOKANE, HAS BEEN EXPOSED FOR PRETENDING TO BE BLACK AFTER HER PARENTS SHOWED HER MONTANA BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND SAID THAT SHE IS WHITE. THOUGH EVERYONE IS LIKE, "YEAH, WE GOT IT AT MONTANA BIRTH CERTIFICATE." [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO SAY CONGRATS TO OUR PAL BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AND HIS WIFE, WHO JUST WELCOMED A A BABY BOY. ISN'T THAT GREAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CONGRATS, BUDDY. NOW COMES THE REAL CHALLENGE, FINDING A NAME OTHER THAN BENEDICT THAT ACTUALLY GOES WITH CUMBERBATCH. [ LAUGHTER ] DOUG CUMBERBATCH? DOESN'T REALLY WORK. THAT'S RIGHT. BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH AND HIS WIFE JUST WELCOMED A BABY BOY. THE BABY WAS 8 POUNDS, 2 OUNCES, AND 20 SYLLABLES. ISN'T THAT NICE? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S CUTE. THIS JUST SEEMS WEIRD TO ME HERE. A COMPANY IS DEVELOPING A SEX DOLL THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE INTELLIGENT CONVERSATIONS WITH USERS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE IF THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN ONE THING, IT'S THAT PEOPLE WHO USE SEX DOLLS REALLY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR DAY FIRST. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE YOU GO. THAT'S RIGHT. A COMPANY IS DEVELOPING A SEX DOLL THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE INTELLIGENT CONVERSATIONS WITH USERS. APPARENTLY THE MOST COMMON THING IT WILL SAY IS, "THAT'S IT?" [ LAUGHTER ] VERY INTERESTING. AND I GOT TO SHOW YOU GUYS THIS VIDEO THAT'S BEEN GOING VIRAL TODAY? DID YOU SEE THIS? THE PUNK ROCK GUY?
Steve: OH, GOD.
Jimmy: IT SHOWS THE LEAD SINGER OF THIS PUNK ROCK BAND, HE WAS CROWD SURFING AT A MUSIC FESTIVAL THIS WEEKEND. HE'S ON TOP OF PEOPLE, LIKE STANDING ON TOP OF PEOPLE'S HANDS, WHATEVER. SOMEBODY THROWS A CUP OF BEER AT HIM. OKAY? CHECK OUT WHAT HAPPENS. [ CHEERS ] [ APPLAUSE ] ♪♪

[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] CAN WE SEE THAT VIDEO AGAIN? THIS IS AMAZING. LOOK AT THIS KID. [ CHEERS ] THAT'S AMAZING! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN HE IS LIKE, "AND THAT WAS PEE. NOT AS COOL AS I THOUGHT."

GUYS, I ALWAYS SAY WE'RE SO LUCKY TO HAVE THE GREATEST BAND IN LATE NIGHT, THE ROOTS. THEY'RE JUST FANTASTIC! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT IT ISN'T ALWAYS FUN AND GAMES. FROM TIME TO TIME WE PUT THE ROOTS TO THE TEST AND PICK PEOPLE FROM OUR AUDIENCE AND HAVE THE ROOTS MAKE UP SONGS ABOUT THEM ON THE SPOT, RANDOMLY. IT'S TIME FOR "FREESTYLIN' WITH THE ROOTS!"

Jimmy: HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED WITH THAT? HOW DID YOU GET --
I GUESS IT STARTED, LIKE I WAS WRITING STAND-UP ABOUT IT. I WAS GOING THROUGH -- I WAS SINGLE AT THE TIME WHEN I FIRST STARTED WRITING THE BOOK. AND I WAS GOING THROUGH THE KIND OF DILEMMAS EVERYONE GOES THROUGH WHERE YOU MEET SOMEONE YOU REALLY LIKE AND YOU TEXT THEM AND YOU DON'T HEAR ANYTHING, AND THEN YOU LOOK ON INSTAGRAM AND THEY'RE POSTING A A PHOTO OF LIKE A HORSE.

I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S LIKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. BUT I DO THINK, LIKE, YOU KNOW, FROM WHAT WE FOUND INTERVIEWING PEOPLE WHEN YOU DON'T HEAR BACK, YOUR MIND KIND OF GOES CRAZY. YOU'RE USED TO HEARING BACK AT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME LIKE YOUR BRAIN IS USED TO THIS CERTAIN, "OH, I SENT HIM A A MESSAGE AT THIS POINT. THEY SHOULD WRITE ME BACK AT A A CERTAIN POINT." WHEN THAT POINT PASSES AND YOU DON'T GET THE MESSAGE YOU START GOING CRAZY A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: NOW IN THIS, YOU ACTUALLY GOT INSIGHT FROM YOUR DAD AS WELL?
