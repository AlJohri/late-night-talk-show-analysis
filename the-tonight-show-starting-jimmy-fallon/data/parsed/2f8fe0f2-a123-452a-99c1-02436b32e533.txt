Jimmy: AGAIN, NO, NO. AGAIN, NO.
WAIT. WE HAD A VERY SPECIAL -- I GOT TO HANG OUT WITH YOU AT AN "SNL" AFTERPARTY. AND I WAS ABLE TO HANG OUT WITH YOUR PARENTS FOR AN EVENING, WHICH WAS A BLAST. YOUR DAD DID HIS BRANDO "GODFATHER" IMPERSONATION FOR ME. WHICH APPARENTLY, HE'S RETIRED NOW. IS THAT TRUE?
Jimmy: I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM DO IT IN A WHILE. BUT WHEREVER WE'D GO, WE'D MAKE HIM DO IT AND HE WOULD PUT FOOD IN HIS MOUTH AND THEN HE'D LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S GOOD.
Jimmy: AND HE WOULD TALK TO YOU AS THE GODFATHER FOR ABOUT, YOU KNOW, A HALF AN HOUR, 45 MINUTES. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT WAS.
Jimmy: THAT WAS THE BIT, YEAH.
THAT WAS GOOD. AND THEN WE WENT -- DO YOU REMEMBER THE PARTY THAT WE WENT TO AFTER -- THE POST-POST-PARTY? DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
Jimmy: I REMEMBER -- WAIT. SO, I KIND OF REMEMBER. THIS IS AROUND 4:00 IN THE MORNING.
IT WAS AROUND 4:00 IN THE MORNING. WE GET INTO AN ELEVATOR TO GO TO SOME PARTY -- IT WAS ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHERE THE ELEVATOR OPENS INTO A A KITCHEN. AND YOUR MOM JUST WENT STRAIGHT UP TO THE COUNTER AND SAID, "I'LL HAVE A CHAMPAGNE, PLEASE."
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND YOU JUST WENT, "MOM, THIS IS NOT A BAR." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT WAS AN APARTMENT.
THIS IS SOMEONE'S HOME.
Jimmy: THIS IS SOMEONE'S APARTMENT.
AN APARTMENT. AND I'M GONNA SAY IT RIGHT NOW, I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOUR MOM. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT LADY KNOWS HOW TO DO IT. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: SHE PUTS MONEY DOWN AND GOES, "I'LL GET A COUPLE CHAMPAGNES. LET'S GET SOME CHAMPAGNES GOING."
AND WE WERE THERE FOR, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.
Jimmy: GOSH, IT WAS SO FUN. WE STAYED A LITTLE BIT AND KEPT THE PARTY GOING. SO SHE WAS LIKE, "TELL COLIN, I SAID HI." YOU'RE A FALLON. YOU'RE AN HONORARY FALLON. THE FALLON'S LOVE YOU.
I TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY.
Jimmy: WE DO, YEAH. WE'RE PROUD OF EVERYTHING YOU DO. ALSO, YOU'RE VERY, VERY TALENTED. THIS NEW THING, "ELVIS & NIXON," I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS THING.
YES.
Jimmy: IT'S BASED ON THIS PHOTO, WHICH I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT -- HOW THIS HAPPENED.
YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE IN THE MOVIE. YEAH.
I'M IN THE MOVIE, YEAH. SO ELVIS SHOWED UP TO THE WHITE HOUSE ONE DAY, SAYING THAT HE WANTED TO MEET THE PRESIDENT SO THAT HE COULD BE DEPUTIZED AS -- THE PRECURSOR TO THE D.E.A. NOW --

Jimmy: SHE WAS GREAT.
WHO'S HILARIOUS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
VERY, VERY FUNNY LADY. SHE AND I PLAY NEW FATHERS AND -- SO A LOT OF OUR SCENES ARE WITH KIDS. THE ADAGE IS DON'T WORK WITH ANIMALS AND DON'T WORK WITH CHILDREN. DEFINITELY DON'T WORK WITH ANIMALS.
Jimmy: THAT'S THE OLD SCHOOL THING.
THAT'S THE OLD SCHOOL THING. THE KIDS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T MIND. I HAVE TWO. YOU HAVE TWO.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO YOU SORT OF KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, ONCE THAT KID STARTS CRYING -- THIS IS GOING TO SOUND MEAN, BUT I MEAN IT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY. ONCE THE KID IS CRYING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TAKE, EVERYONE ELSE IS TRYING TO GET THE KID TO STOP, AND I JUST GO, "I DON'T CARE, WHERE'S THE NEW ONE?" BECAUSE THAT KID -- [ LAUGHTER ] WAIT FOR IT.
Jimmy: THAT DOESN'T SOUND MEAN.
WAIT FOR IT.
Jimmy: THAT DOESN'T SOUND MEAN AT ALL.
LET ME EXPLAIN MYSELF, PLEASE.
Jimmy: THAT DOESN'T SOUND MEAN.
IT'S BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I AM NOT GOING TO CHEER THAT KID UP. THAT KID IS NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY THAT A STRANGER IS, LIKE, MAKING FACES AT IT. THAT KID ONLY WANTS ITS MOM. AND I KNOW THAT AS A PARENT. SO I JUST SAY LET'S PASS THAT KID ON. LET'S BRING THE NEW KID IN. AND WE HAVE THREE OTHERS. SO -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: MULTIPLE CHILDREN. THAT'S VERY, VERY SMART.
