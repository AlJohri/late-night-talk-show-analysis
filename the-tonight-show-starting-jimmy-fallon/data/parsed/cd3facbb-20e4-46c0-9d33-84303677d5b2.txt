THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S FLEET WEEK HERE IN NEW YORK. AND I'M PROUD TO SAY OUR ENTIRE AUDIENCE IS FILLED WITH MILITARY PERSONNEL. YOU CAN TELL ITS FLEET WEEK BECAUSE THIS MORNING I WAS WALKING THROUGH TIMES SQUARE AND JUST LIKE THAT FAMOUS POSTER, I SAW A SAILOR GRAB A YOUNG WOMAN, DIP HER, AND TAKE A SELFIE WITH HER.
Steve: WOW! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: FAMOUS. EVERYONE DOES IT.

I SAW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA FINALLY HAS HIS OWN PERSONAL TWITTER ACCOUNT. [ CHEERS ] EVEN JOHN McCAIN WAS LIKE, "WELCOME TO THE INTERNET, GRANDPA." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TWITTER HANDLE IS POTUS, WHICH, OF COURSE, STANDS FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND AFTER HE JOINED BILL CLINTON, TWEETED THIS MESSAGE TO THE PRESIDENT. I JUST SAW THIS. "WELCOME TO TWITTER, POTUS. ONE QUESTION, DOES THAT COME WITH THE USER NAME STAY WITH THE OFFICE. #ASKINGFORAFRIEND." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A GREAT JOKE. THAT'S A GREAT JOKE.

Jimmy: GUYS A NEW POLL FOUND THAT ALMOST 70% OF VOTERS SAID THAT WHOEVER OUR NEXT PRESIDENT IS, THEY MUST HAVE POLITICAL EXPERIENCE. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE RUDE TO JUST SAY ANYONE BUT DONALD TRUMP. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WOULD BE RUDE. I SAW THAT THE WIFE OF FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY E-MAILED SUPPORTERS AN INVITATION TO AN EVENT NEXT MONTH WHERE HE'LL ANNOUNCE HIS PRESIDENTIAL PLANS. THEN THE CORN DOG IN THIS PHOTO WAS LIKE, "WAIT, YOU'RE MARRIED?" DON'T DO THAT. CALL ME BEFORE YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THERE'S OTHER FOOD AT THE STATE FAIR YOU CAN EAT. YOU CAN HAVE A HAMBURGER, DRINK A SODA. MILK SHAKE. DON'T PUT A CORN DOG.

SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY FUN WAY TO SPEND THE DAY. BUT, IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT, WE BROKE IT DOWN WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SPEND THERE. HOUR ONE, YOU'RE LIKE, "I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GET TO BE IN DISNEYLAND FOR THE WHOLE DAY." THEN HOUR FOUR YOU'RE LIKE, "JUST RODE, IT'S A SMALL WORLD. WHAT A TREAT. THAT SONG DOES GET STUCK IN YOUR HEAD, THOUGH." [ LAUGHTER ] HOUR 15 YOU'RE SAYING, "I'M PRETTY TIRED, BUT HEY IT'S A A WORLD OF LAUGHTER. A WORLD OF DAMN IT!" AROUND HOUR 19 YOU'RE THINKING, "MAYBE THAT'S NOT A MAN WEARING A MICKEY MOUSE HEAD, MAYBE I'M A MOUSE WEARING A MAN'S HEAD." AND FINALLY BY THE 24TH HOUR YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, I'LL HAPPILY COME WITH YOU OFFICER, PRISON IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD TIME FOR EVERYBODY. LONG TIME. THIS IS A LITTLE AWKWARD. ALAN THICKE JUST REVEALED THAT HE AND HIS WIFE LIKE TO, QUOTE, GET FREAKY TO HIS SON ROBIN THICKE'S SONG, "SEX THERAPY." WHICH EXPLAINS ROBIN'S NEW SONG "REGULAR THERAPY." [ LAUGHTER ] GUYS I SAW THAT LIAM HEMSWORTH HAS BEEN CHOSEN AS THE NEW FACE OF DIESEL'S SIGNATURE FRAGRANCE. YEAH.
