MUSICAL GUEST, SARAH McLACHLAN. AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW. AND NOW, HERE'S YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: HOT CROWD! WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW," EVERYBODY. HOW YOU FEELING? GOOD? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. WE GOT A HOT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. HERE IS AN UPDATE ON OUR PAL TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD. [ LAUGHTER ] IN A NEW INTERVIEW, FORD SAID THAT HE'S ENJOYING REHAB BECAUSE IT REMINDS HIM OF THE FOOTBALL CAMP HE WENT TO AS A A KID. AND THE COUNSELOR SAID, "ACTUALLY, THIS IS A FOOTBALL CAMP. YOU WANDERED HERE LAST NIGHT AT 3:00 A.M. PLEASE LEAVE." [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S NOT REHAB. ROB FORD SAYS HE LIKES REHAB BECAUSE REMINDS HIM OF THE FOOTBALL CAMP HE WENT TO AS A A KID. AND THEN HIS PARENTS ARE LIKE, "THAT WAS ALSO REHAB." [ LAUGHTER ] IT REMINDS ME OF A STORY. MY PARENTS --THIS IS A TRUE STORY. OUR NEIGHBOR TOM. WHEN WE WERE KIDS, ME AND MY SISTER HAD THIS NEIGHBOR TOM. WE LOVED HIM, WE ALWAYS WAVED HI TO HIM. HE WAS A NICE GUY. AND THEN TOM DIED. AND MY PARENTS SAID --WE GO, "WHERE'S TOM?" AND SHE GOES, "HE WENT ON VACATION." [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. AND THEN WE HAD THESE TWO BUNNY RABBITS, THEY WERE CALLED HIPPITY AND HOPPITY. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY ORIGINAL. AND WE HAD A HUTCH OUTSIDE, I GUESS, WHERE THE BUNNIES ARE. IT'S CALLED A HUTCH, RIGHT?
Steve: YEAH, A HUTCH.
Jimmy: AND MY DAD PAINTED IT WITH SOME LEAD PAINT OR SOMETHING. IT WAS THE '70s. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE BUNNIES ATE THE PAINT AND DIED. AND WE CAME OUT, GO, "WHERE'S HIPPITY AND HOPPITY?" AND MY MOM JUST SAID, "OH, THEY WENT ON VACATION." [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN FINALLY WHEN WE HAD SAVED UP ENOUGH MONEY FOR ONE SUMMER, MY PARENTS WERE LIKE, "WE HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT, YOU GUYS. WE'RE GOING ON THE VACATION!" AND ME AND MY SISTER STARTING CRYING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NO WE DON'T WANT GO ON VACATION. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT ABOUT TOM AND HIPPITY AND HOPPITY? [ APPLAUSE ] ANYWAYS, GOOD OLD ROB FORD. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST HOPE ROB FORD LEARNS MORE ABOUT SOBRIETY THAN HE LEARNED ABOUT FOOTBALL. CHECK HUT HUT. WHOA. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER IN WASHINGTON. DURING A CONFERENCE THERE YESTERDAY, HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT CHOCOLATE IS ONE OF HER GUILTY PLEASURES. THEN BILL WAS LIKE, "I REMEMBER WATCHING A DANCER NAMED CHOCOLATE." [ LAUGHTER ] "AT A PLACE CALLED GUILTY PLEASURES." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT ONE WAS FROM ROBERT SMIGEL. THAT WAS FROM SMIGEL, YEAH. THIS IS WEIRD. YESTERDAY, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID SAID THAT WORKING WITH REPUBLICANS IS LIKE TRYING TO CATCH A GREASED PIG. AND IT'S A FINE COMPARISON FOR HIM TO MAKE IF HE FEELS THAT WAY, BUT I REALLY COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW LONG HE SPENT JUST TALKING ABOUT GREASED PIGS BEFORE HE MADE HIS POINT. THIS IS REAL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
I'VE BEEN TO A FEW RURAL RODEOS IN MY LIFE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A NUMBER OF THESE RODEOS HAVE AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE GREASED PIG CONTESTS. THE ORGANIZERS GET A LITTLE PIG, PIGLET, AND THEY COVER THIS LITTLE ANIMAL WITH TONS OF GREASE. IT'S A GREASY LITTLE PIG. PIGS ARE A LITTLE SLIPPERY TO BEGIN WITH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU COVER THEM WITH GREASE, THEY'RE REALLY SLIPPERY. THEY TRY TO SCOOP UP THIS SCREAMING PIG. EVERY TIME THEY GRABBED THE PIG THEY SLIPPED, THE PIG GOES ON ABOUT ITS BUSINESS, SO THIS IS PART OF THE REASON I MENTION THIS. OFT TIMES, WORKING WITH MY SENATE REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES REMINDS ME OF CHASING ONE OF THESE LITTLE PIGS IN A GREASED PIG CONTEST. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: EVEN THE PIGS ARE LIKE, "IF YOU LET US CATCH US WILL YOU STOP TALKING? I MEAN PLEASE." [ LAUGHTER ] I SAW THAT MONET'S FAMOUS WATER LILLIES PAINTING WAS SOLD AT AN AUCTION LAST NIGHT FOR OVER $27 MILLION. THE BUYER WAS LIKE, "I'M SO GLAD I CAN FINALLY LOOK AT THIS EVERY DAY." WHILE EVERYONE ELSE WAS LIKE -- [ CAMERA SHUTTER ] "ME TOO. CONGRATS ON SPENDING 27 MILLION. THAT'S PRETTY COOL." [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S A CRAZY STORY. A WOMAN WAS DETAINED THIS WEEK AFTER SHE JOINED THE MILE HIGH CLUB ON A FLIGHT FROM LONDON TO LAS VEGAS. [ CHEERS ] BUT THE GUY SHE WAS IN THERE WITH WAS NOT DETAINED ON THE FLIGHT. HOW TYPICAL, THE GUY GETS OFF BUT NOT THE GIRL. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HEY, WHAT? HO! HEY! HEY! HEY!
Jimmy: DVD!

Jimmy: HEY TARIQ, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
Tariq: JUST STOPPING BY TO CHAT. [ LAUGHTER ] SPRECHEN SIE SMALL TALK? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DO LIKE SMALL TALK, BUT I HAVE TO SAY YOU ALWAYS PICK THE WRONG TIME TO CHAT.
Tariq: I HEARD THAT. HEY YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS NEW MONICA LEWINSKY INTERVIEW? SHE SAID, "IT'S TIME TO BURY THE BLUE DRESS." YEAH, AND THEN BILL CLINTON SAID, [ CLINTON VOICE ] "EWW, YOU STILL HAVE THAT?" [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THAT'S GOOD. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
Tariq: HAPPY SIETE DE MAYO.
Jimmy: YEAH, TAKE CARE, BUDDY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: LISTEN TO THIS. YOU GUYS, SOME RESIDENTS IN TORONTO WANT THE CITY'S PUBLIC LIBRARY TO PULL THE DR. SEUSS BOOK "HOP ON POP" BECAUSE THEY SAY IT ENCOURAGES CHILDREN TO USE VIOLENCE AGAINST THEIR FATHERS. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, WE DID SOME DIGGING HERE AT "THE TONIGHT SHOW" AND IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE SOME OTHER DR. SEUSS BOOKS THAT SEEM TO ENCOURAGE OTHER BAD HABITS.
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: THAT'S TRUE, YEAH. I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AT THE A A FEW OF THESE. FIRST THERE'S "GREEN EGGS AND HANGOVERS." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT GOOD.
Jimmy: HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. IT'S CALLED "HORTON HIRES A A HO." [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: "HORTON HIRES A HO?"
Jimmy: NEXT THERE'S "THE CAT WITH THE TAT." HE HAS A LOWER BACK TATTOO. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN WE GOT, "ARE YOU MY DEALER?" I MEAN --
Steve: WAIT, WHAT?
Jimmy: AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE -- THERE IS "ONE SPLIFF, TWO SPLIFF, RED SPLIFF, BLUE -- WAIT, WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?" [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] KIDS SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO READ THOSE. FINALLY, THE NEW SEASON OF "THE BACHELORETTE" PREMIERS IN JUST A FEW WEEKS. I LOVE "THE BACHELORETTE." LOVE "THE BACHELOR," LOVE "THE BACHELORETTE."
