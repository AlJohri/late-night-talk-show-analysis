Jimmy: SEE THEY HAVE EVERYTHING DOWN THERE.
THEY HAVE EVERYTHING, LOOK AT THIS SHOW, "E.R." CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS?
GUYS, THIS IS WHEN, DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER THIS IS WHEN GEORGE CLOONEY, THIS IS BEFORE HE WAS A MOVIE STAR, WHEN HE WAS A DOCTOR.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS BACK WHEN TV SHOWS WERE SET IN CHICAGO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AND WE GOT YOU A PRESENT, JIMMY.
DON'T THINK WE DIDN'T GET YOU SOMETHING.
DON'T YOU THINK WE DIDN'T GET YOU ANYTHING.
JIMMY.
Jimmy: THANK YOU, GUYS. THANK YOU.
THAT WAS THE APPROPRIATE GIFT.
A GIFT FOR YOU FROM US.
Jimmy: THANK YOU.
THIS IS EXCITING.
Jimmy: WET SHIRT HERE.
IT IS, LOOK IN THE BAG,JIMMY. YES! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WHAT A LET DOWN, RIGHT?
Jimmy: UNBELIEVABLE.
WHAT A LET DOWN.
WE HOPE YOU LOVE IT. WE HOPE YOU LOVE IT.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. I REALLY DO. I REALLY LIKE IT. YOU GOT MY NAME ON IT AND EVERYTHING. YOU GUYS ARE REALLY NICE.
IN NEW YORK, IT'S SO BUSY DOWNSTAIRS. NEW YORK, I'D HATE TO BE THE FIRST TO SAY IT, BUT NEW YORK HAS CHANGED.
Jimmy: IT'S ALWAYS BEEN BUSY.
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME SINCE GIULIANI LEFT, YOU KNOW. WE MISS THE HELL OUT OF HIM.
WE MISS THE HELL OUT OF HIM.
I MEAN, THE GUY WAS A GREAT GUY. THE ONE THING IS HE GOT RID OF ALL THE PORNOGRAPHY IN TIMES SQUARE AND NOW YOU HAVE TO WALK ONE BLOCK WEST TO 8th AVENUE.
Jimmy: THAT'S A PAIN.
HE'S DOING GOOD THOUGH. I SAW HIM ON TV LAST NIGHT. I THINK HE'S IN A REGIONAL PRODUCTION OF DRACULA. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S REALLY RIDING THAT TRAIN.
Jimmy: GUYS, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE THIS IS VERY EXCITING.
THIS IS REAL BY THE WAY. THIS IS A REAL THING.
Jimmy: IT REALLY IS.
WE SHOWED THIS PICTURE TO A A VETERINARIAN, LOOK AT MY LITTLE FINGY, COMIN' IN RIGHT THERE. LOOK AT THAT. WE SHOWED THIS PICTURE TO A A VET, AND HE THOUGHT THAT --
HE THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT A A GROOVY TURTLE AND A MEAN OLD GOAT.
Jimmy: NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT, A GROOVY TURTLE. UH, THIS IS ACTUALLY, IT STARTED WITH JUST YOU GUYS DOING LIKE A, I GUESS, WHAT WAS IT? LIKE A COMEDY NIGHT?
WE DID A LITTLE COMEDY SHOW IN THE EAST VILLAGE AND WE HAD TO HOST IT, AND WE WERE TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY TO HOST IT. LIKE WHAT CHARACTERS TO DO. AND THEN WE WERE WANDERING AROUND THE STRAND BOOKSTORE ONE DAY.
Jimmy: WHICH THE STRAND IS AN OLD BOOKSTORE IN NEW YORK.
USED BOOKSTORE.
IT'S GOOD, THEIR SLOGAN IS 8 MILES OF BOOKS AND 12 MILES OF LONELINESS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
AND WE SAW THESE TWO OLDER GUYS, 70-YEAR-OLD GUYS, BOTH FIND THEIR OWN COPIES OF ALAN ALDA'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY, NEVER HAVE YOUR DOG STUFFED.
WHICH IS A GREAT BOOK. BUT THEY CLEARLY LIVED TOGETHER AND WERE BUYING THEIR OWN HARD COVER COPY.
YEAH.
AND THEIR CLOTHES WAS LIKE CARPETING. LIKE THEIR WHOLE, THEIR COLOR PALATE WAS THANKSGIVING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GIL AND GEORGE ARE THE CHARACTERS.
GIL AND GEORGE, YEAH.
Jimmy: EXPLAIN GIL TO ME.
GIL FAIZON, HE'S A GENTLEMAN IN HIS EARLY 70s. HE'S THE KIND OF GUY WHO BRINGS BEVERAGES TO THE BATHROOM. [ LAUGHTER ] DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
Jimmy: YEAH I KIND OF KNOW THAT GUY. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
AND GEORGE ST. GEEGLAND. GEORGE ST. GEEGLAND THE PATRON SAINT OF DANDRUFF. HE'S THE TYPE OF GUY, HE'S NEITHER JEWISH NOR A WOMAN, BUT LIKE MANY MEN OVER THE AGE OF 70, HE'S SOMEHOW BOTH. GEORGE IS THE TYPE OF GUY YOU WOULD CATCH AT A PARTY GOING THROUGH THE COATS. [ LAUGHTER ]
THEY'RE LIKE, THEIR ESSENCE IS LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM OF A TUB OF HUMMUS, AND YOU CAN'T GET IN THERE WITH A PRETZEL AND YOU GOTTA USE YOUR FINGY'S TO SCOOP OUT THAT LAST? THEY'RE THE FINAL FINGY HUMUS SCOOP ON YOUR FINGER.
IF I MAY, THEIR ESSENCE IS, YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WALK BY A A TRAVEL AGENCY AND YOU'RE LIKE, WHAT? WELL, WHEN THEY WALK BY A A TRAVEL AGENCY, THEY GO, OH, SURE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HOW ARE YOU PREPARING FOR THIS? 'CAUSE THIS IS EIGHT SHOWS A A WEEK. I MEAN, THIS IS BIG TIME GUYS. YOU CAN'T FOOL AROUND. YOU CAN'T GOOF OFF.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO PREPARE. HERE'S WHAT IT IS.
YEAH.
IF YOU'RE PLAYING GUYS IN THEIR MID 70s WHO ARE A LITTLE FLU-LIKE AT ALL TIMES YOU DON'T NEED TO PREPARE. WE DID THE SHOW ON TOUR, I DID IT IN WASHINGTON D.C. I HAD A FULL INDIAN MEAL, LOTS OF BREAD AND GOOP, AND I WAS SO FULL OF FOOD AND I WALKED OUT AND I SAID I'M TOO FULL TO GO ON, AND IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS WE EVER HAD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: BREAD AND GOOP.
YEAH, THEY EAT GOOP.
Jimmy: WHAT HAPPENS ON STAGE? WHAT IS THE STORY ABOUT?
IT'S GREAT. IT'S ABOUT THESE TWO GUYS AND THEY'VE LOST THEIR RENT CONTROLLED APARTMENT AND EVERYTHING. I MEAN, IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.
IT'S LIKE, THEY WROTE A PLAY ABOUT THEMSELVES. THESE ARE TWO GUYS WHO HAVE BEEN IN NEW YORK FOREVER, AND THEY THINK THEY DESERVE A A VICTORY LAP, AND THEY'RE GETTING ONE ON BROADWAY.
IT'S LIKE IF THE MUSIC IN CHARLIE ROSE, YOU KNOW, THE INTRO MUSIC WROTE A PLAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: THE SHOW IS ABSOLUTELY REAL. SO EXCITED FOR YOU GUYS AND I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE IT.
AND I GOTTA CHECK THIS "SEINFELD" SHOW OUT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]

JIMMY, WE'RE GOING TO DO A A CARD TRICK HERE TONIGHT.
Jimmy: I LOVE CARD TRICKS. I LOVE EVERY TRICK YOU DO ON THE SHOW.
VERY GOOD, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE A NORMAL DECK OF CARDS. INSTEAD WE ARE GOING TO USE THESE CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY CARDS.

Jimmy: OKAY.
VERY GOOD, AND I WANT YOU TO THINK OF THE FIRST SHORT WORD THAT POPS INTO YOUR HEAD AFTER READING THAT CARD. THE FIRST SHORT WORD. YOU GOT ONE?
Jimmy: ONE OF THESE WORDS?
NO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] AFTER READING THAT -- LIKE A A WORD ASSOCIATION.
Jimmy: OH, OKAY.
DON'T SAY IT. JUST THINK IT.
Jimmy: I KNOW, BUT I'M TRYING TO SUM IT ALL UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
TAKE YOUR TIME.
Jimmy: OKAY, GOOD I GOT IT.

Jimmy: YEAH.
PERFECT. I WANT YOU TO WRITE THAT SHORT WORD ON THAT CARD. I'M GOING TO TURN AROUND. I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK. AND ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT, I WANT YOU TO WRITE YOUR INITIALS OR YOUR SIGNATURE ON THE BOTTOM ON THE CORNER OF THAT CARD JUST TO MAKE THAT CARD UNIQUE, SPECIAL, DIFFERENT. AND ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE PEN AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE AND LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THAT.
Jimmy: DO I HOLD THE CARD?
YES.
Jimmy: WHAT DO I DO WITH THE CARD?
JUST HOLD IT TO YOUR CHEST. LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: OKAY I'M DONE. DAN, I'M DONE.

AND BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING ELSE, I'M GOING TO CUT THESE CARDS, AND I WANT YOU TO HOLD OUT YOUR RIGHT HAND. HOLD OUT YOUR RIGHT HAND FOR ME. PERFECT. I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS BOX. I'M GOING TO PLACE THE CARDS INTO THE BOX AND I WANT YOU TO PUT YOUR OTHER HAND ON TOP OF THE BOX. OTHER HAND ON TOP OF THE BOX. PERFECT.
Jimmy: OKAY.
JIMMY. HIS IS GOING TO SOUND KIND OF WEIRD, BUT I DREAM ABOUT YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S TRUE. BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DREAM ABOUT YOU, BECAUSE YOU -- YOU'RE ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW," RIGHT? YOU'RE IN THE HOMES OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND EVERY NIGHT PEOPLE, THEY SEE YOU RIGHT BEFORE THEY GO TO SLEEP.
Jimmy: THAT'S CORRECT.
YOU'RE THE LAST VOICE THAT THEY HEAR.
Jimmy: IT'S NIGHTTIME, THAT -- SURE, YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
JIMMY, BEFORE I CAME ON THE SHOW, BEFORE I FOUND OUT I WAS COMING BACK ON THE SHOW, I HAD A DREAM. I HAD A DREAM ABOUT US. I HAD A DREAM ABOUT US BEING HERE. I HAD A DREAM ABOUT US PLAYING CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY.
Jimmy: OH, GOOD.

Jimmy: YEAH.
THAT WAS A FAIR CHOICE.
Jimmy: YEP.
PERFECTLY FAIR.

"ZESTY BREAKFAST BURRITO," YES. AND THEN YOU WROTE A WORD DOWN, RIGHT? YOU WROTE A WORD DOWN ON THAT CARD. WE HAVEN'T SET ANYTHING UP. WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THIS.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TRICK I WAS DOING. I KNEW TO LOOK AT THE CAMERA. THAT'S ALL I KNEW. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S ALL YOU KNEW. YOU KNEW NOTHING ELSE. SWEAR TO THEM THAT WE HAVE NOT SET ANYTHING UP.
Jimmy: I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
PERFECT. PERFECT. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jimmy: SPICY, YEAH.
JIMMY, IN MY DREAM A WORD POPPED OUT TO ME. AND IT'S BEEN IN MY HEAD EVER SINCE, AND BECAUSE OF THAT I WROTE SOMETHING DOWN, BUT I WROTE IT IN CHALK.
Jimmy: MMHM.
