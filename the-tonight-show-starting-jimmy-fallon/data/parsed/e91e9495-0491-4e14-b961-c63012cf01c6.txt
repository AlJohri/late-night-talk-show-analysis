Jimmy: YEAH, I WAS IN "JURASSIC WORLD," BIG DEAL.
WHATEVER.
Jimmy: BIGGEST MOVIE EVER. YEAH, I GUESS SO. I MEAN -- [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH. I'M GONNA GET CUT OUT OF THAT THING." YEAH. NO, I WAS VERY HAPPY. WE HAVE A CLIP. HERE'S ANDREW RANNELLS WITH ANNE HATHAWAY IN "THE INTERN," IN THEATERS FRIDAY. CHECK THIS OUT.
HEY. I NEED YOU FOR TWO MINUTES UNINTERRUPTED.
OKAY.
YOU REMEMBER A FEW WEEKS AGO, WE TALKED ABOUT THE SENIOR INTERN PROGRAM?
NO.
REALLY? WE HAD A WHOLE, BIG CONVERSATION ABOUT IT.
WE DID? OKAY, REMIND ME. SENIORS IN HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE?
NO, NO, NO, NO. SENIORS IN LIFE, OLDER PEOPLE.
HOLD ON. WHAT?
I TOLD YOU I FELT LIKE WE NEEDED TO DO AN OUTREACH PROGRAM. YOU DEFINITELY SEEMED TO BE LIKING THE IDEA, SO I SET IT IN MOTION. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
HOLD, PLEASE. YOU'RE HIRING SENIOR CITIZEN INTERNS?
THERE'S BEEN A TON OF RESEARCH ON THIS, AND THE RESULTS ARE ACTUALLY INCREDIBLE. I MEAN, IMAGINE HAVING AN INTERN WITH A LIFETIME OF EXPERIENCE AS OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY WHO SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF THEIR LIFE PLAYING BEER PONG. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OUR THANKS TO ANDREW RANNELLS. "THE INTERN" IS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. GO CHECK IT OUT. WE HAVE STAND-UP FROM BRIAN REGAN AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WE ARE JOINED RIGHT NOW BY A VERY, VERY FUNNY, VERY TALENTED MAN. IF YOU ASK ALL THE ESTABLISHED COMICS WHO'S THEIR FAVORITE STANDUP, MOST OF THEM SAY THIS GUY'S NAME. THIS SATURDAY NIGHT AT 9:00 P.M., YOU CAN SEE HIM IN THE FIRST EVER LIVE COMEDY CENTRAL SPECIAL, "BRIAN REGAN LIVE FROM RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL." PLEASE GIVE A WARM "TONIGHT SHOW" WELCOME TO BRIAN REGAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. HEY. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S VERY NICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M FEELING GOOD. I JUST HAD MY ANNUAL PHYSICAL. WITH A NEW DOCTOR. NEW DOCTOR FOR ME. YOU EVER GO TO A BRAND-NEW DOCTOR AND THE MOMENT HE WALKS IN, YOU'RE LIKE, "NO. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, THIS AIN'T GONNA WORK OUT. I NEED AN AIR VENT OR SOMETHING I CAN CRAWL THROUGH." I WAS SITTING THERE. I'M NERVOUS ENOUGH. DOCTOR WALKS IN. ALL THE BUTTONS ON HIS LAB COAT WERE OFF BY ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] IF HE CAN'T NAIL THAT TASK, I DON'T THINK I WANT HIS DOCTOR PAWS ON ME. AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND LIKE I'M MAKING THIS UP. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH. HE WAS LATE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I DON'T GET THE DOCTOR BEING LATE THING. I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT'S ACCEPTED. IF I HAVE A 2:00 APPOINTMENT, I WANT THE DOCTOR LOOKING AT ME AT 2:00. AND THE ONLY WAY I THINK IT WOULD BE OKAY FOR THE DOCTOR TO BE LATE IS IF IT'S FIVE OF 2:00, YOU'RE IN THE WAITING ROOM, AND YOU NOTICE FROM UNDER THE DOOR THAT LEADS TO THE BACK ROOMS, A POOL OF BLOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] AN EVER-WIDENING POOL OF BLOOD COMING OUT INTO THE WAITING ROOM. EVERYONE HAS TO LIFT THEIR FEET. "I THINK WE MIGHT BE DELAYED." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN IT WOULD BE OKAY. FOR HIM TO BE FIVE MINUTES LATE. CLAMP WHATEVER'S DOING THAT. AND GET ME BACK THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO HEAR A CLAMP NOISE AND HIM SAYING, "MY 2:00 IS HERE." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT I NEED SOMEBODY TO LOOK AFTER ME LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW? 'CAUSE I'M NOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO MYSELF. I LOOKED IN THE MIRROR THE OTHER DAY -- THIS IS EMBARRASSING. I NOTICED A TWO-INCH HAIR GROWING OUT, DEAD CENTER, FROM THE MIDDLE OF MY FOREHEAD. HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] ALL THE OTHER HAIRS ARE UP HERE. HOW DOES ONE HAIR DO A LONE WOLF? [ LAUGHTER ] "WE'RE DOING A JAILBREAK!" AND I KNOW IT WAS TWO INCHES BECAUSE I MEASURED IT. NOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR A HAIR TO GROW TWO INCHES, BUT NOBODY IN MY LIFE BOTHERED TO TELL ME ABOUT IT FOR THE ENTIRE GROWING SEASON. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY MUST HAVE HAD DAILY CONVERSATIONS. "HAS HE NOTICED YET? "HE HAS NOT." [ LAUGHTER ] "HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?" "I DON'T KNOW. HE MUST LOOK DIRECTLY INTO THE MIRROR AND THE HAIR MUST BE PERFECTLY STRAIGHT. AND HE MUST NOT MOVE HIS HEAD A A BILLIONTH OF AN INCH. HE IS UNAWARE OF HIS UNIHAIR." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] NOT COOL, YOU KNOW? AND I'M TRYING TO BE COOL. IN FACT, I'M THINKING OF GETTING A TATTOO. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT I WANT TO GET A TATTOO THAT IS UNIQUE. YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT A TATTOO LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE HAS. SO I'M GOING TO GET A TATTOO OF A BLENDER. A BIG ONE ON MY CHEST. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN WHEN I GO TO THE PUBLIC POOL AND TAKE MY SHIRT OFF, EVERYONE WOULD BE SPELLBOUND. THEY WOULD BE LIKE, "IT'S -- IS THAT -- A BLENDER?" BORN TO FRAPPE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. THANKS. I DON'T KNOW, I HAVE WEIRD TATTOO IDEAS. I THINK SOMEONE SHOULD GET A A TATTOO OF A DOZEN EASTER EGGS. BUT TELL THE TATTOO ARTIST TO HIDE THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU GET BACK IN SHAPE, YOU MIGHT FIND A GOLDEN EGG. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: BRIAN REGAN. WE'LL TALK TO BRIAN AFTER THE BREAK. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HANGING OUT WITH BRIAN REGAN. DO NOT MISS THIS -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: DO NOT MISS HIS COMEDY CENTRAL SPECIAL, "BRIAN REGAN LIVE FROM RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL" THIS SATURDAY. SET YOUR DVRs, YOUR TIVO, SET YOUR VCRs, IF YOU STILL HAVE ONE, GOOD FOR YOU. 9:00 P.M. THIS SATURDAY. THIS IS A FIRST. THEY'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.
COMEDY CENTRAL HAS NEVER DONE A LIVE SPECIAL. I PITCHED THE IDEA TO THEM, AND THEY SAID LET'S DO IT.
Jimmy: YOU LOOK GOOD. YOU'RE CAMERA OF READY.
AW, THANK YOU.
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU'RE READY TO GO. ABSOLUTELY.
HEY. ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE A A BIG DEAL FOR ME. I ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, I SPENT IT LAST COUPLE MONTHS -- I LOST TEN POUNDS. AND THEN I FOUND OUT THAT TV ADDS TEN POUNDS. SO BASICALLY, I HAVE BEEN WASTING MY TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU GOTTA LOSE 20. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
YOU GOTTA LOSE 20 TO LOOK LIKE YOU LOST --
Jimmy: YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THE MATH INVOLVED.
I DIDN'T HAVE THE MATH.
Jimmy: YOU TOLD ME THERE WAS ANOTHER BRIAN REGAN WORKING IN HOLLYWOOD.
YEAH.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW THIS.
I DIDN'T KNOW EITHER. THERE'S A BRIAN REGAN SCREENWRITER. THIS IS TRUE, AND HE'S A REALLY GOOD WRITER. HE WROTE "102 DALMATIANS" AND "HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN TEN DAYS" AND A BUNCH OF OTHER MOVIES. A VERY GOOD WRITER, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HIM. I WAS ON THE ROAD AND THESE PEOPLE SAID, "YOU WANT TO DO A A LOCAL TV INTERVIEW?" I'M LIKE, "YEAH. YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD." [ LAUGHTER ] THEY SAID, "WE WANT TO DO IT OUT IN FRONT OF THE MOVIE THEATER." AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHATEVER. WHEREVER YOU WANT TO DO IT." THEY SAID, "YEAH, WE WANT TO HAVE THE '102 DALMATIANS' LOGO BEHIND US DURING THE INTERVIEW." I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW? DOES THAT LOOK GOOD ON CAMERA? [ LAUGHTER ] WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO. SO I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON. WE'RE SITTING IN THE TWO CHAIRS. AND THE GUY GOES, "SO TELL ME ABOUT THE MOVIE '102 DALMATIANS'." [ LAUGHTER ] I'M LIKE, WELL -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE SOME TIE-IN. I SAY, "WELL, THAT'S A LOT OF DOGS JUMPING AROUND. [ LAUGHTER ] SO YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE FUN." AND THEN HE GOES, "HOW WILL '102 DALMATIANS' BE DIFFERENT THAN FROM '101 DALMATIANS'?" I SAY, "WELL, I'M NOT A MATH EXPERT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M THINKING ONE DOG."
Jimmy: YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE TO CHECK OUT BRIAN REGAN THIS SATURDAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ON COMEDY CENTRAL. ONE OF THE FUNNIEST. THANKS FOR ALWAYS BEING A GREAT GUY TO ME. ALWAYS BEEN NICE TO ME. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. MY THANKS TO JAME SPADER, ANDREW RANNELLS, RIGHT THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BRIAN REGAN ONCE AGAIN. AND GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS FROM PHILADELPHIA RIGHT THERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STAY TUNED FOR "LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS." THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. HAVE A GREAT NIGHT. I HOPE TO SEE YOU TOMORROW, EVERYBODY. BYE-BYE.
