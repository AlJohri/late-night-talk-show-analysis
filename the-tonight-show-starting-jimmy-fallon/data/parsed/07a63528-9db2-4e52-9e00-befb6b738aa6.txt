[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE OTHER BIG NEWS TODAY IS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED A A MASSIVE REPORT ON THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, CALLED THE NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT. WHICH BEATS ITS ORIGINAL TITLE, "IT'S GETTING HOT IN HURR." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT, THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED A REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE.

[ LAUGHTER ] [ SOUTHERN ACCENT ] RIGHT AFTER WE BUILD THAT MEINEKE, WE SHOULD DO WOODSTOCK. [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT THIS WAS COOL ACTUALLY. YESTERDAY THE NSA ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS HIRING A NEW CODE BREAKER. AND LISTEN TO HOW THEY DID IT. THEY TWEETED OUT THE JOB POSTING IT IN AN ENCRYPTED CODE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS REAL.

WE KINDA TRY TO BRO DOWN WITH THEM AS ONE WOULD. WE TRY TO THINK WE'RE COOL AND HIP. WE BRING THEM OVER SOME GANGA AND TRY TO KINDA WIN THEM OVER. AND AT FIRST WE THINK IT COULD WORK. AND THEN LIKE IN REAL LIFE, YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE IT WOULD THE WORST THING EVER TO LIVE NEXT TO A FRATERNITY, AND THEN WE START TO HATE EACH OTHER AND GO TO WAR. IT'S SAD THAT I'M THE OLD GUY IN THE MOVIE NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU'RE PLAYING THE OLD GUY.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.
Jimmy: BUT ZAC, ZAC EFRON IS PLAYING THIS FRAT GUY AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S DEPTH TO HIS CHARACTER. HE'S NOT JUST A FRAT GUY.
NO.
Jimmy: HE'S GOT ISSUES AND PROBLEMS.
HE DOES. AND IT'S SO AMAZING THAT SOMEONE AS HANDSOME AS THAT IS ABLE TO MAKE YOU FEEL ANY SYMPATHY FOR HIM IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULD.
Jimmy: NO, NOT AT ALL. BUT MAN, OH MAN -- IT JUST MADE ME LAUGH, AND I LOVE THAT ACTUALLY YOU PLAY A HUSBAND AND WIFE IN THE MOVIE AND THEY LIKE EACH OTHER.
WE ACTUALLY GET ALONG VERY WELL IN THE MOVIE.
Jimmy: A LOT OF MOVIES YOU WATCH, EITHER THE WIFE IS LIKE A --
I'M A HUMORLESS SHREW.
Jimmy: HE'S SUCH A LITTLE BOY. HE PLAYS CARDS ALL NIGHT WITH THE BOYS.
EXACTLY, YEAH. AND THE HUSBAND WAS TRYING TO AVOID THE WIFE BY DOING STUFF AND LYING TO HER ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: BUT THIS ONE, YOU GUYS ARE BEST FRIENDS AND YOU'RE BOTH LIKE -- OH, I CAN SEE WHY THEY'RE MARRIED.
YEAH, WE'RE EQUALLY AS STUPID AS ONE ANOTHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, EXACTLY, YEAH. WHICH IS LIKE REAL LIFE.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: NO, NO.
IT'S A BIG STEP FORWARD FOR WOMEN IN FILM. WE HAVE THE BALLS TO MAKE ONE AS STUPID AS THE MEN --
Jimmy: YOU BOTH ARE LIKE, "WE'RE STILL COOL."
YEAH.
Jimmy: WE STILL GOT IT. IT'S COOL. LET'S GO AND DO IT UP. AND ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP HERE I'M GOING TO SHOW. THIS IS YOU GUYS ARE DECIDING TO MAYBE WENT OUT. WE CAN STILL BE YOUNG AND COOL. LET'S BRING THE BABY TO A RAVE.
WE GET INVITED TO A RAVE. AND WE DEBATE BRINGING OUR BABY WITH US TO THE RAVE, BASICALLY. YEAH, AS ONE WOULD.
Jimmy: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. HERE'S A CLIP FROM THE MOVIE "NEIGHBORS." HERE'S SETH ROGEN AND ROSE BYRNE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY CAN BRING THEIR BABY TO A RAVE. CHECK THIS OUT.
MY FRIEND IS SPINNING AT THE ROYALTON TONIGHT. THERE'S A RUMOR THAT PRINCE MIGHT PERFORM.
I REALLY NEED TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.
HOW DO WE DO THIS?
WE DON'T HAVE A BABY-SITTER.
HELLO, BRING HER?
N-N-N-NO. YES? NO. YES? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
LET'S DO IT.
THIS COULD BE LIKE THE DOORWAY TO A WHOLE NEW LIFE WHERE WE HAVE IT ALL. WE HAVE FUN AND A BABY.
FANTASTIC. LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.
BABY'S FIRST RAVE.
BABY'S FIRST RAVE.
BABY'S FIRST RAVE! BABY'S FIRST RAVE. BABY'S FIRST RAVE. [ CHANTING ] BABY'S FIRST RAVE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SHOULDN'T DO THAT.
Jimmy: YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.
Jimmy: YOU SHOULD NOT DO THAT AT ALL. SETH, IT'S A GREAT FILM. CONGRATULATIONS.

OH, GOODNESS.
Jimmy: DETAILING OOH-LA-LA. [ CHEERS ]
THIS ONE -- I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN IT. THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE I'M SMELLING SOMETHING SLIGHTLY OFFENSIVE.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO.
I LOOK LIKE, "MUFFY, I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOOT DOWNWIND, MUFFY."
Jimmy: "HELLO, MUFFY. I TOLD YOU NOT TO." IN THIS ONE YOU'RE LIKE, "I'M GOING TO KILL YOU." AND THE NEXT ONE YOU'RE LIKE, "HEY." [ LAUGHTER ] I LIKE THE TURTLENECK -- BLAZER.
YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE IT UP.
Jimmy: YEAH. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU LOOKING FIT BECAUSE AFTER SEEING YOU IN THIS FILM, GOSH YOU LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT FOR THIS.
I DID, YES.
Jimmy: HOW MANY POUNDS DID YOU LOSE?
I STOPPED WEIGHING MYSELF AFTER 35 AND WE STILL HAD A A WAYS TO GO IN PRODUCTION. BUT I JUST THOUGHT, THIS IS NOT WHAT I SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON. THIS NOT "THE BIGGEST LOSER."
Jimmy: NO, EXACTLY. NO --
I'M JUST GOING TO WORK AND DOING MY JOB.
Jimmy: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO WATCH YOU. WHAT A GREAT PERFORMANCE IN THIS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jimmy: DID YOU GET ANY ADVICE FROM MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY? YOUR CO-STAR IN "MAGIC MIKE?"
I DID, YEAH. I CALLED MATTHEW AND WE SPOKE RIGHT AFTER HE FINISHED HIS FILM LAST YEAR "DALLAS BUYER'S CLUB." AND, HE GAVE ME SOME ADVICE, AND THEN I KINDA DID MY OWN THING AND TOOK HIS ADVICE. HE WAS VERY GENEROUS ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: DID YOU JUST NOT EAT? IS THAT HOW YOU DO IT?
I FASTED FOR 21 DAYS. AND THEN WENT ON AN EXTREMELY REGIMENTED DIET THAT IS ABOUT 300-400 CALORIES.
Jimmy: GOSH THAT DOES NOT SOUND HEALTHY AT ALL.
IT SHOULD NOT BE DONE WITHOUT CLOSE MEDICAL SUPERVISION.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S TWO BITES OF MY LUNCH. [ LAUGHTER ] 300 CALORIES, YEAH.
IT WAS TWO BITES OF MY LUNCH AND THEN SUDDENLY IT WASN'T ANYMORE.
Jimmy: WAS IT TOUGH TO GAIN THE WEIGHT BACK?
NO, THAT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY. [ LAUGHTER ] WE FINISHED RIGHT AT THANKSGIVING, AND I HAD TO COOK THANKSGIVING DINNER FOR 14 PEOPLE. AND I WAS LIKE, "I'LL EAT EVERYTHING, TOO." MY STOMACH WAS LIKE "NO, YOU WON'T." [ JIMMY DOING BABY VOICE ]
Jimmy: NOW I'M SMALLER. I'M A TINY STOMACH.
WE'RE GONNA LET YOU REVISIT THAT. FAST ON THE WAY OUT.
Jimmy: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: IT WAS JUST CRAZY, RIGHT?
YEAH IT WAS CRAZY.
Jimmy: THIS I SAW "THE NORMAL HEART" IS BASED ON A A PLAY, AND I SAW THE PLAY AND OH, MY GOODNESS IT'S POWERFUL, DO YOU WANT TO TELL EVERYONE WHAT IT'S ABOUT?
IT'S BASED ON A PLAY BY LARRY KRAMER WHO IS JUST THIS INCREDIBLE ACTIVIST AND PLAYWRITE.
Jimmy: WHEN DOES YOUR ROLE TAKE PLACE?
EARLY 80'S.
Jimmy: EARLY 80'S.
IT'S TAKEN 30 YEARS TO MAKE IT INTO A MOVIE, FINALLY. IT'S A TRUE STORY. IT'S REALLY ABOUT THIS INCREDIBLY BRAVE GROUP OF WOMEN AND MEN IN NEW YORK WHO ARE REALLY THE FIRST TO SPEAK UP AND RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE DISEASE THAT WOULD LATER BECOME KNOWN AS AIDS.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT IT WAS.
NOBODY KNEW THE AMOUNT OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE GOING ON IS INSANE. WHEN YOU SEE THIS, IT JUST -- LIGHTS A FIRE IN YOUR BELLY.
Jimmy: AND THE MAYOR -- NO ONE WANTS TO SPEAK OUT OR DO ANYTHING.
IT WAS A DARK CHAPTER IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY FOR SURE, BUT ONE THAT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER.
Jimmy: IT'S JAW DROPPING. WHEN YOU SEE THIS THING, YOU WON'T EVEN BELIEVE IT. YOU GO, "I CAN'T BELIEVE WE LIVED IN A SOCIETY LIKE THIS NOT TOO LONG AGO. IT'S JUST -- HONESTLY, IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THIS THING GOT MADE. MAN IT'S A KNOCKOUT PERFORMANCE, BY THE WHOLECAST AND EVERYONE. IT'S YOU, JULIA ROBERTS.
CORRECT.
Jimmy: PHENOMENAL IN THAT.
THE AMAZING MARK RUFFALO.
Jimmy: MARK RUFFALO IS GREAT IN THAT.
JIM PARSONS.
Jimmy: JIM PARSONS, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH HE WAS IN THE PLAY.
JOE MANTELLO.
Jimmy: JOE MANTELLO. IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE. AND I WANT TO SHOW -- WE HAVE A A CLIP HERE. THIS MATT BOMER THING. WHICH ONE IS THIS?
