Steve: FROM STUDIO 6B IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, IT'S "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON." PLEASE JOIN JIMMY AND HIS GUESTS -- LIAM NEESON. LINDSAY LOHAN. MUSICAL GUEST, BAD THINGS. AND FEATURING THE LEGENDARY ROOTS CREW. AND NOW, HERE'S YOUR HOST, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE. OH, HEY. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. THIS IS FUN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OH MY GOODNESS, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW" EVERYBODY. THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN TONIGHT. YOU GUYS IN A GOOD MOOD? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CAN YOU FEEL IT? I CAN FEEL IT. WELL, HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. A BIG DAY FOR REPUBLICANS. THEY CAME FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO WASHINGTON, D.C. TODAY FOR THE START OF THE CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL ACTION CONFERENCE. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS KHAKI-PALOOZA. [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT THIS WAS GREAT. REPUBLICAN SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL KICKED OFF THE CONFERENCE. THIS IS TRUE. HE WALKED ON STAGE WITH A RIFLE WHILE BON JOVI'S "LIVIN' ON A A PRAYER" PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HIS WIFE WAS LIKE "NO MORE NYQUIL FOR YOU, MISTER." [ APPLAUSE ] NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE ALSO GAVE A A SPEECH AT THE CONFERENCE. AND SOME EXPERTS SAY IT COULD BE HIS CHANCE TO TURN THINGS AROUND. YEAH. [ APPLAUSE ] TURN THINGS AROUND, WHICH IS ALSO WHAT PEOPLE DO WHENEVER THEY GET TO A BRIDGE IN NEW JERSEY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEY JUST SAY, HEY -- GO THE OTHER WAY. I CAN'T --
Steve: HEY, FUGGETABOUT IT.
Jimmy: THIS IS A LITTLE UNUSUAL. THE GOP IS RELEASING SEVERAL SHORT DOCUMENTARIES ABOUT SENATE CANDIDATES TO GIVE THE PUBLIC A LOOK AT THEIR PERSONAL LIVES. SO IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO IS EXCITED TO SEE SEVERAL DOCUMENTARIES ABOUT SENATE CANDIDATES, ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ZOLOFT. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST CHECK IT OUT. JUST ASK HIM OR HER. ASK YOUR DOCTOR. [ APPLAUSE ] ANOTHER BIG POLITICAL STORY, PRESIDENT OBAMA JUST RELEASED HIS BUDGET FOR 2015. ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS CONSERVATIVES HAVE WITH THE BUDGET IS THAT IT JUST ISN'T REALISTIC. IT'S MORE OF A LIBERAL WISH LIST, THEY'RE SAYING. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT, BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE ITEMS AND SEE WHAT YOU GUYS THINK. HE HAS $4 BILLION TO TURN ALL SCHOOL BUSES INTO REALLY LONG YELLOW PRIUSES. [ APPLAUSE ] I DON'T SEE HOW THAT --IT'S A A LITTLE UNNECESSARY. HE ALSO EARMARKED $1.5 MILLION FOR RESCUING EVERY DOG IN THAT SARAH McLAUGHLIN COMMERCIAL. [ APPLAUSE ] I CAN GET BEHIND THAT. A LITTLE EXPENSIVE, BUT I CAN DO IT.
Steve: A LITTLE PRICEY.
Jimmy: VERY, VERY SAD. AND THEN FINALLY HE PUT ASIDE $80 MILLION TO ROUND UP ALL GUNS, MELT THEM DOWN, AND TURN THEM INTO PENS TO SIGN GAY MARRIAGE LICENSES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A LITTLE EXTREME. [ APPLAUSE ] I SEE WHERE THE CONSERVATIVES ARE COMING FROM. BUT MORE DRAMA OUT OF WASHINGTON, D.C. YESTERDAY ON C-SPAN, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ELIJAH CUMMINGS GOT INTO A SHOUTING MATCH WITH REPUBLICAN DARRELL ISSA AFTER ISSA TURNED OFF HIS MICROPHONE DURING A HEARING. BIG FIGHT. BUNCH OF YELLING, FOLLOWED BY THE MIKE BEING CUT OFF, OR AS WE CALL IT IN MY FAMILY, A A WEDDING TOAST. [ APPLAUSE ] HAD ENOUGH. WE HAD ENOUGH. I JUST WANNA SAY -- ALL RIGHT. SOME INTERNATIONAL NEWS. HERE, SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY FLEW TO PARIS YESTERDAY FOR AN EMERGENCY MEETING ON THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE, BUT RUSSIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER NEVER SHOWED UP. [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] WELL, ACTUALLY HE DID SHOW UP, BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT KERRY WASN'T AS HOT AS HIS PROFILE PIC, HE JUST DITCHED HIM RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] AFRAID TO GET CATFISHED. YOU DON'T WANT TO GET CATFISHED. [ APPLAUSE ]
Steve: YES. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY. AN ANCHOR FOR RUSSIA'S STATE-OWNED NEWS CHANNEL QUIT ON LIVE TV. YEP, SAYING THAT SHE DOESN'T AGREE WITH THE NETWORK'S SUPPORT OF VLADIMIR PUTIN. IN A RESPONSE, PUTIN SENT HER SOMEWHERE WHERE NO ONE WILL NEVER SEEN HER AGAIN -- CNN. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] IN A VERY INTERESTING MOVE.
Steve: THIS IS LONELY.
Jimmy: THIS ISN'T GOOD, HERE. I SAW THAT STAPLES IS CLOSING MORE THAN 200 STORES AS PART OF A PLAN TO SAVE $500 MILLION. STAPLES SAYS THE CLOSINGS ARE DUE TO LOW SALES, CUTBACKS AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE SELLING THINGS THAT PEOPLE JUST STEAL FROM THEIR OFFICE ANYWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] HONEY, THE PRINTER'S BROKEN. I'LL JUST TAKE ONE FROM THE OFFICE WHEN I GET BACK. NEED ANYTHING ELSE? ONE OF THOSE ERGONOMIC CHAIRS? YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE? YEAH, WE'LL GET ONE. THEY'RE GOOD FOR YOUR BACK. HEY, PARENTS, LISTEN TO THIS. A NEW SURVEY FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN CHILD WATCHES 24 HOURS OF TV EVERY WEEK. THAT'S A LOT. IN FACT, EXPERTS SAY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PARENTS TO LAY DOWN THE LAW AND TELL THEIR KIDS TO GET OUTSIDE AND LOOK AT THEIR PHONES. [ LAUGHTER ] GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY MINECRAFT. GO. [ APPLAUSE ] I LOVE THIS STORY. THERE'S A GUY IN THE NEWS RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE HE'S SUING A A CASINO IN LAS VEGAS FOR LETTING HIM GAMBLE AWAY $500,000 WHILE HE WAS DRUNK. [ LAUGHTER ] HE SAID THAT THEY LET HIM GET DRUNK AND BLOW ALL HIS MONEY. AND THE CASINO SAID "YEAH, EXACTLY." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT A CASINO DOES. [ APPLAUSE ] BUT THE MAN ACTUALLY RELEASED A A STATEMENT ABOUT THE INCIDENT. I DON'T THINK HE DID HIMSELF ANY FAVORS. TAKE A LOOK. I JUST WANNA SAY I'M APPALLED THAT THE CASINO -- I'M A A GAMBLER. I MEAN, IT'S LIKE C'MON, I JUST WANNA HAVE FUN. DO YOU WANNA HAVE FUN? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S JUST A COUPLE DRINKS, AND I WAS ON A REAL HOT STREAK. JUST GOT A LITTLE LUCKY IS ALL. I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT BACK, YOU KNOW. I DIDN'T TOUCH ANYBODY, I DIDN'T MEAN NOTHING. I'M SORRY. I LOVE YOU, MAN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I SMELLED HIS STATEMENT, AND IT SMELLS LIKE WHISKEY. THIS IS EXCITING. THEY JUST RELEASED A TRAILER FOR THE NEW MOVIE "TRANSFORMERS, AGE OF EXTINCTION" THIS WEEK. IT LOOKS AWESOME. MAYBE IT WAS JUST ME, THOUGH. I WAS WATCHING THE TRAILER AND I THINK -- I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE IT'S JUST ME. -- EVERYONE IN THE MOVIE SOUNDS LIKE PEE-WEE HERMAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Steve: REALLY?
Jimmy: TELL ME IF I'M RIGHT. YEAH, HIGGINS, I SWEAR. THIS IS IT. WELL, LET ME PLAY THE TRAILER, YOU TELL ME IF I'M RIGHT.
BRING IT UP. ALL THE WAY. THIS STUFF IS WHAT'S GOING TO PUT YOU THROUGH COLLEGE. [ LAUGHTER ]
IS THAT NORMAL STEEL?
I THINK WE JUST FOUND A A TRANSFORMER.
HA HA. HA HA. AH LA-LA-LA-LA-LA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: JUST A LITTLE BIT. AM I RIGHT?
Steve: MAYBE.
Jimmy: I HEARD IT.
Steve: MAYBE.
Jimmy: MAYBE.
Steve: MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH. SOME TECH NEWS HERE. APPLE ANNOUNCED THAT IT'S WORKING ON A HEARING AID THAT WILL SYNC UP WITH THE iPHONE. WHICH WOULD BE GREAT IF PEOPLE WHO WEAR HEARING AIDS HAD ANY IDEA WHAT iPHONE WAS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ OLD MAN VOICE ] WILL IT PLUG INTO MY CROSS WORD PUZZLE? [ LAUGHTER ] IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. [ LAUGHTER ] YES, IT WILL PLUG INTO YOUR CROSSWORD PUZZLE. [ OLD MAN VOICE ] I'M GOING UPSTAIRS THEN. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I FORGOT SOMETHING.
Steve: BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ THEATER OF THE MIND.
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, NEXT WEEK, COLORADO WILL HOST A A MARIJUANA JOB FAIR FOR WEED COMPANIES -- [ CHEERS ] -- THAT WANT TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES.

Jimmy: HEY, WE GOT A BIG SHOW TONIGHT, YOU GUYS. BIG STARS. I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT GETTING A TRUCK. I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT IT.
Steve: HAVE YOU NARROWED IT DOWN AT ALL?
Jimmy: I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO ABOUT 12 TRUCKS.
Steve: DO YOU WANT A JAG?
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT A TRUCK. TARIQ, THAT'S NOT WHAT A TRUCK IS. A JAGUAR IS -- EXACTLY, THERE YOU GO. YESTERDAY I ASKED TARIQ. I SAID, "ROOTS DO YOU HAVE A A TRUCK?" THEY GO "TARIQ HAS A TRUCK!" I GO, "DO YOU HAVE A TRUCK," AND TARIQ GOES "YEAH, I HAVE A A MINI COOPER." [ LAUGHTER ] NOT A TRUCK AT ALL. SO, ANYWAY, AGAIN, I DON'T WANT A FREE TRUCK FROM ANYONE.
Steve: NO, THIS IS NOT PAYOLA, BECAUSE THAT IS ILLEGAL.
Jimmy: I EARNED THIS MONEY, AND I'M GOING TO BUY A TRUCK. I THINK I SHOULD HAVE A TRUCK.
Steve: IT'S AMERICA.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] I MIGHT GET A NISSAN OR SOMETHING, BUT STILL -- NO. I'M LOOKING AT THAT, AND THEY WERE --
Steve: TOYOTA TUNDRA.
Jimmy: GMC, TOYOTA TUNDRA IS MADE IN ALABAMA.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE? A FORD F-150 EVERYONE'S SAYING THEY LIKE. PEOPLE ON TWITTER. ANYWAYS, DODGE RAM HAS ONE PARKED OUTSIDE THE BUILDING RIGHT NOW.
Steve: ARE YOU SERIOUS?
Jimmy: YEAH, THERE'S A TRUCK PARKED IN FRONT OF NBC RIGHT NOW. YEAH, THEY WANT ME TO TEST DRIVE IT. TARIQ, DO YOU WANT TO TEST DRIVE IT?
Tariq: YES.
Jimmy: GO DOWN RIGHT NOW. GO FOR IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: C'MON.
Tariq: WE GOT A SHOW TO DO, MAN. I'LL DO IT LATER.
Jimmy: DO IT RIGHT NOW.

LET'S GET RIGHT TO THIS. THIS GUY IS A GREAT ACTOR. HE'S A GREAT NEW YORKER. HE'S GOT THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE RIGHT NOW. IT'S CALLED "NON-STOP." LIAM NEESON IS HERE.

I'M TELLING YOU IT'S GONNA BE THE NUMBER ONE SHOW ON THE OPRAH WINFREY NETWORK. LINDSAY LOHAN IS STOPPING BY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S CALLED "LINDSAY." WE'RE GOING TO TALK -- WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO EACH OTHER, AND THEN LINDSAY BROUGHT -- WE ALWAYS LIKE TO PLAY A GAME ON THE SHOW. AND SHE GOES, LIKE, "I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME WATER WAR." I'VE NEVER PLAYED -- THERE'S NEVER BEEN A FEMALE GUEST THAT I'VE PLAYED -- BASICALLY WHAT IT IS, IT'S WAR WITH THE CARD GAME. BUT THE LOSER GETS WATER THROWN IN THEIR FACE. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW THAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING THAT, BUT I WAS -- I WOULD GENTLY POUR, BUT --

Jimmy: NO, NO, NO, NO. OF COURSE, YEAH, BUT IT'S GOOD. BUT NOW YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE DOING, I SAW SOMEWHERE THAT YOU'RE DOING AN EPISODE OR AN ARC ON "TWO BROKE GIRLS"?
YES.
ARE YOU REALLY?
YEAH.
Jimmy: THIS IS GREAT.
I REALLY LOVE KAT DENNINGS I'M EXCITED TO MEET HER.
Jimmy: THE WHOLE CAST IS GREAT. THERE'S A GREAT WRITER MORGAN MURPHY, WHO USED TO WRITE FOR US, TALK TO HER. AND HAVE HER GIVE YOU SOME GOOD ONE LINERS. SHE'S A SMARTY-PANTS, SHE'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD.
COOL, THANK YOU. I'M EXCITED.
Jimmy: AND ARE YOU DOING A A FILM AS WELL?
YEAH, I START "INCONCEIVABLE" IN APRIL. AND I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE SHOOTING THAT YET. WE'RE KIND OF FINALIZING EVERYTHING WHEN I GET TO L.A. SO I'M GOING TO L.A. FOR A BIT.
Jimmy: SO IN THE MEANTIME NOW, YOU ENDED UP DOING THIS DOCU-SERIES WITH OPRAH.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID I'M GOING TO L.A. FOR A BIT. BY THE WAY, I'M GONNA BE SCREWED WHEN I GET TO THE AIRPORT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, DON'T TELL THEM. TELL THEM I'M GOING WITH YOU, AND THEN THEY WON'T SHOW UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M SO COMFORTABLE HERE.
Jimmy: THEY WON'T BE THERE. I'LL BE THERE. I'LL BE RIGHT NEXT TO HER. [
PHOTOBOMBING THE PAPARAZZI.
Jimmy: PHOTOBOMBING, YEAH. AIRBRUSH HIS FACE OUT OF THERE. BUT IT'S CALL "LINDSAY" WHICH IS AN ORIGINAL TITLE. I LOVE IT. THIS SUNDAY, I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF IT YET?
I'VE SEEN NOTHING.
Jimmy: I'VE SEEN LIKE CLIPS HERE AND THERE.
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE I STARTED -- I HAVE THE TV ON ALWAYS AT HOME, AND MY FRIENDS WERE OVER. AND I KEPT HEAR MY NAME DOWNSTAIRS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I ACTUALLY GOT REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT, BECAUSE IT WAS ON ALL OF THESE -- IT WAS LIKE PERFECT THE OSCAR AND THE SHOW. SO THEY'LL JUST BE TALKING ABOUT THE OSCARS THE ENTIRE TIME.
Jimmy: WHY, YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE SHOW?
WELL, I JUST -- I KNEW --
Jimmy: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS?
BUT IT'S SO -- IT'S VERY CLEAR IT'S A TELEVISION SHOW, THEY WANT RATINGS, OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN, SO THEY PICKED LIKE THE FIRST TWO MONTHS WHEN I GOT BACK TO NEW YORK AFTER BEING IN TREATMENT AND KIND OF -- I BECAME REALLY SPIRITUAL OVER THE PAST YEAR, AND I WAS TRYING TO FIND SERENITY AND PEACE IN MY LIFE. AND OF COURSE THEY TAKE THE CHAOS OF ME MOVING EIGHT YEARS OF MY LIFE FROM L.A. BACK TO THE CITY IN NEW YORK --
Jimmy: WELL THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE WANTS TO TUNE IN TO SEE.
WHICH IS REALLY HARD TO DO.
Jimmy: THEY WANT TO SEE IT.
WELL SO IT'S LIKE, OPRAH REPRIMANDS LINDSAY AND SHE SAYS THE WORD --.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T WHISPER THE WORD. IT STILL COUNTS AS A WORD.
SO, I CALLED -- STARTED CALLING OPRAH. AND I ACTUALLY BUTT DIALED HER A FEW TIMES WHICH WAS KIND OF EMBARRASSING.
Jimmy: YOU BUTT DIALED OPRAH?
YES.
Jimmy: YOU GUYS CALL EACH OTHER?
SHE'S LIKE, HEY GIRL IT'S O.
Jimmy: SHE TELLS YOU IT'S O?
SHE SAYS HE, IT'S -- AND I SAID, I'M JUST GOING HONEST, THERE ARE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN AN UNKNOWN NUMBER COMES UP, AND I DO JUST WANT YOUR VOICEMAIL. [ TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ]
Jimmy: OPERA'S VOICEMAIL ON YOUR PHONE. TO PLAT FOR PEOPLE, YEAH. IT'S LIKE LINDSAY LOHAN, IT'S OPRAH! [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK UNDER YOUR CHAIR. HOW DID YOU PUT SOMETHING UNDER MY CHAIR. WELL, I'VE SEEN SOME CLIPS. I THINK PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE SURPRISED TO SEE -- YOU KNOW, A A DIFFERENT SIDE OF YOU, AND ACTUALLY GET -- AND JUST SEE THE LINDSAY WE ALL KNOW, WHICH IS THE MOST FUN COOLEST GIRL OUT THERE.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: AND I THINK YOUR DAD COMES OFF REALLY WELL IN THE CLIPS I'VE SEEN TOO AND THEY'RE VERY SMART. IT'S GOOD, BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS WHAT WE READ IN THE MAGAZINES AND THINGS WE JUST SEE PAPARAZZI OR RED CARPET OR YOU GOING TO COURT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE SEE. AND WE PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER IN OUR HEADS, AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
THAT'S THE PAST, THOUGH. AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW, I FEEL REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH SOMEONE LIKE OPRAH AND KIND OF CREATE -- I HAVE THIS STRONG BOND WITH HER. WHERE SHE'S -- I CAN CALL HER AND SHE ACTUALLY GIVES ME WONDERFUL ADVICE AND SHE'S BECOME A STRONG PERSON FOR ME TO, YOU KNOW , LISTEN TO AND LEARN FROM IN LIFE.
Jimmy: GOOD TO HEAR. THAT'S AWESOME. I LOVE THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT. NOW, WE LOVE TO PLAY WITH YOU. REMEMBER, WE DID, "EW."
YES.
Jimmy: WE DID A SKETCH CALLED, "EW."
