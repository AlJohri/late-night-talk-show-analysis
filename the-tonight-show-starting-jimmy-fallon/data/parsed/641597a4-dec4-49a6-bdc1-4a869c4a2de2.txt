Questlove: 572.
Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! ♪♪ HI, EVERYONE! WELCOME! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME! WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THIS IS IT. YOU MADE IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE WATCHING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOT CROWD TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS IN GREECE YESTERDAY, TO MEET WITH THE GREEK PRIME MINISTER. YEP, OBAMA WENT TO THE BIRTHPLACE OF DEMOCRACY TO SAY, SPOILER ALERT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT, OBAMA BEGAN HIS FINAL FOREIGN TRIP IN ATHENS, GREECE. WHILE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE JOE BIDEN HELD HIS FINAL TOGA PARTY. AS VICE PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] DAD'S GONE! ♪♪ WAS LIKE A -- ARE WE THE CONGA LINE? WHAT ARE WE DOING? ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ IT'S LIKE A PIZZA ON THE TURNTABLE.
Steve: YEAH.
Jimmy: OR THE RECORD, I DON'T KNOW.
Steve: SOMEBODY PLAYING THE BASE.
Jimmy: DAD'S GONE. WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING DAD. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] BUT TO MARK OBAMA'S VISIT, GREECE'S PRESIDENT MADE A TOAST IN HIS HONOR. IT WAS VERY NICE. CHECK OUT WHAT HE SAID. [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. ISN'T THAT NICE? I THINK THAT -- I THINK THAT'S THE TRANSLATION.
Steve: I THINK THAT. YEAH, I DON'T SPEAK GREEK. IT'S ALL GREEK TO ME.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] BETWEEN NOW AND INAUGURATION DAY, DONALD TRUMP'S TRANSITION TEAM HAS TO APPOINT 4,000 PEOPLE. AND BECAUSE THEY NEED TO HIRE SO MANY PEOPLE IN SUCH A SHORT TIME, THEY MADE A SPECIAL JOB APPLICATION FOR ANYONE INTERESTED. AND SO RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, THE BEST WAY TO FILL IT OUT TO LAND A JOB IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRST QUESTION IS, DID YOU VOTE FOR TRUMP? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO ANSWER YES ON THAT. NEXT QUESTION IS, DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING TRUMP SAID DURING THE ELECTION? FOR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO ANSWER NO. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S A -- [ APPLAUSE ] AND FINALLY, FOR THE QUESTION, ARE YOU A U.S. CITIZEN? YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CIRCLE, IS THIS A TRAP? [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] AND THERE YOU GO. JUST, JUST A LITTLE HELPFUL HINT AND YOU'LL BE IN THERE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
Steve: LITTLE FYI.
Jimmy: DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. YESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE REPORTEDLY RECEIVED THEIR FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEFING OF SENSITIVE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. OR AS TRUMP ASKED PUTIN, "DO YOU PREFER EMAIL OR FAX?" [ LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, IT'S BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT DONALD TRUMP'S NAME WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE TRUMP PLACE APARTMENT BUILDINGS HERE IN MANHATTAN. BUT TRUMP'S ALREADY FOUND ANOTHER PLACE FOR IT. TAKE A LOOK. IT'S SUBTLE. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK IT'S -- YOU BARELY, YOU BARELY NOTICE IT.
Steve: TASTEFUL. TASTEFUL.
Jimmy: "IT IS CLASSY, IT IS BEAUTIFUL, IT'S FANTASTIC." I'M GUESSING NOBODY'S MORE UPSET ABOUT TRUMP BEING ELECTED THAN THIS MAN IN IOWA. HE MADE A BET WITH A FRIEND LAST WEEK AND THINGS DIDN'T TURN OUT SO WELL FOR HIM. CHECK THIS OUT.
ZACH COLBERT SUPPORTS BERNIE SANDERS. BUT HE PROMISED TO GET A TATTOO OF DONALD TRUMP ON HIS BODY, IF TRUMP WON THE ELECTION. ZACH WENT TO A TATTOO ARTIST AND POSTED EVERY MARK LIVE ON FACEBOOK.
I'M THINKING ABOUT MY LIFE AND HOW -- HOW IT WENT WRONG. AND NOW I'M IN A CHAIR GETTING A TRUMP STAMP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: TRUMP STAMP.
Steve: TRUMP STAMP.
Jimmy: HE GOT A TRUMP STAMP. MIGHT AS WELL GET THE TRUMP TATTOO NOW BEFORE THEY'RE MANDATORY. [ LAUGHTER ] TRUMP STAMP. A LITTLE CELEBRITY GOSSIP HERE. CARRIE FISHER CLAIMS IN HER UPCOMING BOOK THAT SHE HAD AN AFFAIR WITH HARRISON FORD ON THE SET OF "STAR WARS."
Steve: REALLY? [ AUDIENCE OOHS ]
Jimmy: AND JABBA THE HUT WAS LIKE, "YOU SAID YOU DON'T DATE CO-WORKERS." WHAT'S THE DEAL? [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS THEY WERE MAKING WOOKIE. [ LAUGHTER ] DAD'S GONE! ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: HAN SOLO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I SAW THAT SNAPCHAT'S PARENT COMPANY HAS FILED PAPERWORK TO SELL ITS STOCK PUBLICLY. SNAPCHAT, YEAH. NOW COMES THE HARD PART, TEACHING IT'S PARENT COMPANY HOW TO USE SNAPCHAT. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, "NO. DAD, JUST DON'T DO IT! GET OFF IT!" CHECK THIS OUT, THE RIDE SHARING APP "LYFT" IS GOING TO DEBUT A NEW COLOR CHANGING DISPLAYS ON CAR DASHBOARDS ON NEW YEAR'S EVE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO FIND YOUR RIDE. THOUGH ON NEW YEARS EVE MOST PEOPLE WILL BE LUCKY IF WE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A A CAR AND A MAILBOX. IT'S LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] "SEE YOU LATER. I THINK MY CAR IS HERE. OH, IT'S FOR YOU. HOLD ON A SECOND." LISTEN TO THIS. I SAW THAT DENVER JUST APPROVED A LAW THAT WILL MAKE IT THE FIRST CITY IN THE U.S. THAT LETS PEOPLE SMOKE MARIJUANA IN PUBLIC PLACES LIKE BARS AND RESTAURANTS. [ CHEERS ] WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR THE THREE STONERS WHO ACTUALLY LEAVE THEIR HOMES. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THAT WOULD BE A BIG DEAL TO THEM. "I'M GOING TO VENTURE OUT, DUDE! AH!" [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, HERE'S A CRAZY STORY COMING OUT OF CALIFORNIA. APPARENTLY A MAN THERE WAS JUST ARRESTED, THIS IS REAL, FOR TERRORIZING RESIDENTS IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD BY BLASTING AN AIR HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS NOT, I'M NOT, I'M NOT JOKING. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS GUY'S MUGSHOT. LOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] KIND OF LOOKS LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE AIMED THE AIR HORN BACKWARDS. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, MY GOODNESS. CAN WE SEE THAT GUY AGAIN? FORGET THE AIR HORN? ARE WE SURE THAT HE WASN'T JUST MAKING THAT NOISE HIMSELF? [ AIR HORN ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT! GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

I APPRECIATE IT, MAN. IT WAS A SURREAL EXPERIENCE. I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN OR NOT. WHEN THEY CALLED MY NAME, I ALMOST FAINTED. HAD TO REMIND MYSELF TO GET UP AND WALK UP ON STAGE AND JUST SAY THANK YOU. IT WAS AMAZING. AMAZING.
Jimmy: THAT WAS COOL. I MEAN, YEAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND I LOVED IT. BUT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. WE'VE MET BEFORE.
NO, BRO. WE DID A MOVIE TOGETHER. WE WERE IN A MOVIE CALLED "TAXI." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
YOU WERE IN IT.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND I GOT CUT OUT OF IT. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS LIKE A MOUNTED NEW YORK CITY COP WHO HAD NEVER RODE A HORSE BEFORE. AND I ALMOST LOST THE JOB BECAUSE THE CASTING DIRECTOR WAS LIKE, ARE YOU SURE HE CAN RIDE THE HORSE, RIGHT? AND I HAD A HORSEBACK RIDING LESSON, AND THEN THIS THING GOT CUT BECAUSE I PROBABLY LOOKED REALLY STRANGE ON TOP OF THE HORSE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I HAVE THIS PHOTO HERE.
WHAT DO WE HAVE? OH, LORD.
Jimmy: I REMEMBER THIS NOW. THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS YOU THERE. THAT WAS GREAT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE FANTASTIC.

NO, NO. THE FIRST MOVIE I DID WAS "BROWN SUGAR." AND I GOT CUT OUT OF THAT, TOO. BUT I WENT TO THE MOVIE WITH MY FAMILY. AND I WENT LIKE OPENING NIGHT. I WAS TELLING, "MOM, I'M ABOUT TO BE IN MY FIRST MOVIE." AND SO WE WATCHED THE MOVIE. IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT I GOT CUT OUT. MY MOTHER WAS LIKE, "WERE YOU THE BROTHER PLAYING BASKETBALL, LIKE IN THE BACKGROUND?" [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE, "OH YOU WERE GOOD!" I'M LIKE, "NO, MAMA, THAT WASN'T ME." [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE. BUT I'M HOPING THAT TONIGHT, THIS COLLABORATION, I DON'T GET CUT OUT OF IT.
Jimmy: YOU WILL NOT GET CUT OUT TONIGHT. NO, WE'RE TALKING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'RE HERE TONIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jimmy: NO PROBLEM. YOUR PHONE WAS BLOWING UP WHEN YOU WON THE EMMY, RIGHT?
I TURNED MY PHONE OFF AT THE EMMYS, BECAUSE IT ONLY HAD LIKE 30% BATTERY.
Jimmy: YEAH.
AND SO, AFTER I WON THE EMMY, I WIND UP FINDING OUT THAT -- SORRY ABOUT THAT. I WIND UP FINDING OUT THAT THINGS WERE A LITTLE PECULIAR.
