IN 1973 ON THANKSGIVING EVE, I GOT DRUNK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. THERE'S A TALE TO BE TOLD. I WENT TO AN ALL CATHOLIC, ALL BOYS PREP SCHOOL IN JERSEY CITY. AND THE SCHOOL WAS INVITED TO A A THANKSGIVING EVE DANCE IN UPSTATE NEW YORK AT AN ALL GIRLS ACADEMY. RUN BY A GROUP OF VERY STRICT NUNS. THE NUNS OF NAVARONE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, ALONG WITH THE INVITATION CAME A SERIOUS WARNING. THERE WOULD BE NO ALCOHOL TOLERATED ON THE PREMISES. AND NO FUNNY BUSINESS WITH THE GIRLS. NOW HEARING THIS, THE GUYS I WAS TRAVELING WITH IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT SEVERAL BOTTLES OF APPLE FLAVORED WINE AND CONDOMS.
Jimmy: OF COURSE.
NOT APPLE FLAVORED CONDOMS. WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THE '90s FOR THAT TECHNOLOGY. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M TALKING APPLE FLAVORED WINE OF THE BOONE'S FARM VARIETY. YOU KNOW, FROM THE WONDERFUL VINEYARD OF NEWARK. [ LAUGHTER ] GUARANTEED TO CAUSE NAUSEA, DROWSINESS, AND BRAIN DAMAGE.

YEAH. WE HEAD TO UPSTATE NEW YORK, AND FIND A SECLUDED HILLY SECTION AT THE CAMPUS. WE SIT DOWN, AND THE FOUR OF US, WE DRINK ABOUT 7 OR 8 BOTTLES OF THIS ROTGUT. NEXT THING I KNOW, I WAKE UP, IT'S DARK OUT, THE DANCE IS ALREADY IN PROGRESS, AND I'M LEFT ALONE. STORY OF MY LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I WALK TOWARDS THE GYMNASIUM. I SEE A FRIEND OF MINE DANCING WITH A YOUNG LADY AND I TAP HIM ON THE SHOULDER. AND I SAY, I'M NOT FEELING WELL. AND I SUDDENLY LAUNCH INTO MY BEST LINDA BLAIR IN "THE EXORCIST" IMPRESSION AND START VOMITING ALL OVER MYSELF. AND THIS IS BEFORE TIDE TO GO STICKS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HELP, BUT YEAH.
MY FRIENDS DRAG ME OUTSIDE TO GET ME INTO THE FRESH AIR, WHILE A S.W.A.T. TEAM OF ANGRY NUNS ARE DESCENDING. AND THEY START WALKING ME AROUND IN THE HOPES OF SOBERING ME UP, BUT THIS ONLY MAKES ME DIZZIER AND MORE NAUSEOUS. SO, I THROW UP AGAIN. I FELL DOWN A HILL AND ROLLED INTO A CREEK. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS TRUE. I'M NOW SOAKING WET, I'M COVERED IN VOMIT, MUD, AND LEAVES, AND TAD POLES, IT'S A A NIGHTMARE. OR WHAT NICK NOLTE USED TO CALL TUESDAY NIGHT.
