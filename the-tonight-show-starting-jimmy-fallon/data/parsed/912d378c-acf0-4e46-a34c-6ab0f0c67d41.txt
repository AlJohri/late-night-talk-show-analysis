Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR SOME FUN? HERE WE GO. WELCOME. WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AT HOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, EVERYBODY. THIS ISN'T GOOD HERE. I READ THAT DONALD TRUMP'S HOTEL CHAIN MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED A DATA BREACH THAT MAY HAVE EXPOSED PEOPLE'S DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD INFORMATION TO HACKERS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. WHEN ASKED HOW HE PLANNED ON FIXING THE SITUATION, TRUMP WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING TO BUILD A A HUGE FIREWALL." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] "AND I'M GOING TO MAKE THE HACKERS PAY FOR IT." [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, BEN CARSON CONTINUES TO RISE IN THE POLLS. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK HE'S A LITTLE TOO LAID BACK, OR SLEEPY, TO BE PRESIDENT. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE A A POINT. CHECK OUT WHAT HE SAID WHEN ASKED ABOUT HURRICANE JOAQUIN THIS WEEK.
IF YOU WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING RIGHT NOW WITH TROPICAL STORM JOAQUIN? WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY IN THE WHITE HOUSE? WHAT WOULD YOU BE YOUR FIRST STEP?
UH -- I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY. THANK YOU.
Jimmy: MAKE SOMETHING UP. I MEAN, ANYTHING.
Steve: I DON'T KNOW.
Jimmy: STOCK UP ON WATER, ANYTHING. I DON'T KNOW.
Steve: WHO KNOWS?
Jimmy: IS HE TALKING ABOUT A A HURRICANE OR DID HE JUST DRINK A HURRICANE? I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] MORE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS WERE JUST RELEASED, AND ONE SHOWS THAT SHE HAD MADE A A LIST OF TALKING POINTS FOR A A TRIP TO L.A. IN CASE SHE RAN INTO ELLEN DeGENERES. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS IRONIC BECAUSE BILL DOES THE SAME THING IN CASE HE RUNS INTO HILLARY. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S LIKE, "OH, HI, HILLARY, HEY. I LIKE YOUR -- IS THAT A NEW HAIRCUT?" [ LAUGHTER ] I READ THAT HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN IS HAVING SOME TROUBLE SCHEDULING AN EVENT DOWN IN FLORIDA BECAUSE THE TOWN DOESN'T WANT TO PAY FOR EXTRA SECURITY. I MEAN, COME ON. WHAT'S THE WORSE THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IN FLORIDA?
A MAN FROM FLORIDA IS IN JAIL AFTER POLICE SAY HE ATTACKED HIS MOTHER WITH POTATO SALAD. [ LAUGHTER ]
A MONKEY WHO ESCAPED HIS ENCLOSURE IN FLORIDA, WASN'T AFRAID TO, UH, TAUNT POLICE.
A FLORIDA WOMAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED AFTER POLICE UNCOVERED PHOTOS OF HER RIDING A PREGNANT SEA TURTLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
CHRISTIAN RADECKI DANCED ON TOP OF THE SUV. DEPUTIES ASKED HIM WHY HE DID THIS. HE SAID HE FELT THREATENED BY VAMPIRES. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
Steve: YEAH. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
Jimmy: GOT A POINT, MAN. IF YOU GET THREATENED BY A A VAMPIRE, YOU GOTTA DANCE ON TOP OF A POLICE SUV.
Steve: A POLICE CRUISER.
Jimmy: THAT'S CORRECT. LET'S GET TO SOME SPORTS HERE. I SAW THE JETS ARE PLAYING THE MIAMI DOLPHINS IN LONDON THIS WEEKEND. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOING TO ENGLAND. THEY'RE OFF TO ENGLAND. AND GET THIS, APPARENTLY, THE JETS' PLAYERS PACKED 350 ROLLS OF TOILET PAPER. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS TRUE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE THE THINNER TOILET PAPER USED OVERSEAS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID. BUT THIS MORNING, I SAW BUCKINGHAM PALACE. I GET IT. [ APPLAUSE ] COME ON, THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY. REAL FUNNY.
Steve: SMART GUY.
Jimmy: YEAH, GO CLEAN IT UP. IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY BIG WEEKEND FOR TV. "THE GOOD WIFE," "HOMELAND" -- [ APPLAUSE ] -- "CSI: CYBER" ALL HAVE THEIR SEASON PREMIERES ON SUNDAY. SHOWS ABOUT A POLITICAL SCANDAL, SECRETIVE FOREIGN DIPLOMACY, AND E-MAIL SECURITY. OR AS HILLARY PUT IT, "LIVED IT, LIVED IT, LIVING IT." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HAPPENING THIS SUNDAY. THIS IS PRETTY CRAZY. I HEARD THAT A RECENT COMPUTER GLITCH ALLOWED A MAN TO TEMPORARILY BUY THE DOMAIN GOOGLE.COM FOR ONLY $12. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, GOOGLE WANTED TO BUY IT BACK, AND THE COMPANY MADE HIM A GENEROUS OFFER OF NOT RELEASING HIS SEARCH HISTORY. [ LAUGHTER ] "OH, TAKE IT, TAKE IT, TAKE IT. I NEVER -- I NEVER USED IT. NEVER USED GOOGLE." WELL, THIS IS PRETTY AMAZING. I READ THAT AN ADVERTIZING COMPANY IS TESTING BILLBOARDS THAT USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO CHANGE THEIR SLOGAN BASED ON WHETHER THE PERSON LOOKING AT IT IS HAPPY OR SAD. LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS. FIRST, THERE'S A BILLBOARD FOR APPLEBEE'S HERE, RIGHT? IF YOU'RE HAPPY THE SLOGAN IS, "COME HAVE A MARGARITA." IF YOU'RE SAD, IT'S, "COME HAVE SEVEN MARGARITAS." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THEY JUDGE BY --
Steve: THEY JUDGE BY YOUR HAPPINESS.
Jimmy: YEAH. NEXT, THERE'S A BILLBOARD FOR THE GAME MADDEN 2016. IF YOU'RE HAPPY, THE SLOGAN IS "A GREAT GIFT FOR YOUR SON." IF YOU'RE SAD, IT'S "HIS STEPDAD ALREADY GOT THIS FOR HIM." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] FINALLY, THERE'S A BILLBOARD FOR HOT POCKETS. IF YOU'RE HAPPY, THE SLOGAN SAYS "A DELICIOUS TREAT IN 30 SECONDS." IF YOU'RE SAD, IT'S "HAPPY THANKSGIVING." [ APPLAUSE ] PERFECT STRATEGY. IT IS DELICIOUS. THIS IS KIND OF A WEIRD STORY. A MAN IN DENVER GOT $900 WORTH OF BOTOX TREATMENTS YESTERDAY, AND THEN RAN OUT OF THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE WITHOUT PAYING. [ LAUGHTER ] THE MAN IS DESCRIBED AS LOOKING NOTHING LIKE HIS DESCRIPTION. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] IF YOU SEE -- LOOKS SORT OF LIKE A SURPRISED VOLDEMORT.
Steve: YEAH. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: FINALLY, YOU GUYS, THIS WAS MAKING THE ROUNDS YESTERDAY. APPARENTLY, GUCCI'S LUXURY CLOTHING LINE JUST RELEASED SOME NEW FUR SLIPPERS WORTH $1,800, AND THEY'RE ALREADY SOLD OUT. THIS IS REAL. THIS IS A REAL PHOTO, LOOK AT THIS SLIPPER. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK DONALD TRUMP'S HAIR JUST SWIPED RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. YOU GUYS, GIVE IT UP FOR THE ROOTS!

I'M NOT AN ACTOR SO THIS IS HARD FOR ME, BUT PICK ONE OF THEM.
Jimmy: WELL, IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.
Seth: OBVIOUSLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WELL, I MEAN, EVERY TIME I GO --
Seth: IT'S A BINARY NUMBER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH, IT'S A BINARY NUMBER. IF I GO TO THE FREEWAY AND TAKE THE 495. 'CAUSE FOUR PLUS NINE.
Seth: IS TWO.
Jimmy: THEN DO MINUS FIVE AND DIVIDE IT BY FOUR.
STEVE JOBS AND I WERE ONCE ROBBED AT GUN POINT OUTSIDE A A PIZZA PARLOR?
Seth: OKAY, WHERE WERE YOU?

Jimmy: '72?
Seth: HAD YOU EATEN OR WERE YOU ABOUT TO EAT? [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WE HAD EATEN. WE HAD EATEN.
Jimmy: WHAT KIND OF PIZZA DID YOU EAT?
PEPPERONI.
Jimmy: STEVE ATE PEPPERONI?
IN THOSE DAYS. THIS IS STEVE ZERO, BEFORE APPLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: STEVE ZERO? NEVER HEARD OF THAT ONE. OKAY. AND SO, YOU WALKED OUT AND THE GUY JUST CAME OUT OF AN ALLEYWAY, LIKE A MOVIE?
NO.
Seth: DID HE PUT THE GUN IN YOUR FACE?
THE CAR.
Seth: YOU WERE IN THE CAR?
HE DIDN'T POINT THE GUN AT US, BUT HE MADE IT VISIBLE THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE CAR.
Seth: REALLY?
Jimmy: HE WAS IN THE CAR?
NO.
Seth: HE WAS STANDING OUTSIDE THE CAR?
STEVE JOBS AND I WERE IN THE CAR.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND DID YOU HAVE A WEAPON?
NO.
Seth: WHOSE CAR WAS IT?
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
Seth: IF IT WAS YOURS OR STEVE JOBS?
I THINK IT WAS STEVE JOBS.
Jimmy: WHAT WERE YOU DRIVING?
I CAN RECALL STEVE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND ME BEHIND HIM.
Jimmy: CAN YOU RECALL WHAT KIND OF CAR IT WAS?
WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS. IF IT WAS MY CAR, IT WAS A A PINTO.
Jimmy: YEAH, BUT IF IT WAS HIS CAR, WHAT WAS IT?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
Jimmy: OH, REALLY? INTERESTING! YOU DON'T REMEMBER.
PROBABLY -- PROBABLY A DODGE DART.
Jimmy: YEAH, PROBABLY. PROBABLY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUSTED HARD THERE. I DON'T KNOW WITH THIS ONE.
Seth: HE HELD UP UNDER PRETTY INTENSE QUESTIONING.
Jimmy: YEAH, I TRIED TO MAKE HIM STUMBLE ABOUT THE CAR.
Seth: NO, IT DIDN'T WORK.
Jimmy: IT DIDN'T QUITE WORK.
Seth: I THINK IT'S -- I HONESTLY DON'T THINK IT'S TRUE.
Jimmy: I FORGOT TO ASK HIM LIKE WHAT HAPPENED AND HOW DID HE GET OUT OF IT.
Seth: YEAH, EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ] I ASSUMED THAT YOU GAVE HIM EVERYTHING YOU HAD.
YEAH. WELL, TURNS OUT HE WAS ONLY STEALING ONE THING AND HE GAVE US HIS NAME AND PHONE NUMBER.
Seth: WHAT?
HE ONLY STOLE ONE THING THAT WE HAD SHOWN HIM IN THE PIZZA PARLOR, AND HE GAVE US HIS NAME AND PHONE NUMBER.
Seth: SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW.
OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE KIND OF STOLE IT. ONE OF THESE LITTLE DEVICES FOR LIKE MAKING FREE CALLS THAT I BUILT.
Seth: AH.
AND HE STOLE IT.
Seth: SO, WAIT, IS THIS TRUE?
AND THEN HE CAME BACK TO THE CAR AND GAVE US HIS NAME AND PHONE NUMBER, HE SAID BECAUSE I THINK HE WAS HALF HONEST, HE SAID HE WANTED TO PAY FOR IT BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY RIGHT THEN.
Seth: DID HE HAVE A GUN?
HE HAD A GUN.
Jimmy: AND HE DID HAVE A GUN? SO IT REALLY HAPPENED.
WELL, HE ALSO WANTED TO KNOW HOW TO USE IT.
Seth: SO, HE STOLE A THING HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO USE?
Jimmy: WAS THIS BILL GATES?

Jimmy: CRUZ! WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
NO PROBLEM.
Jimmy: I APPRECIATE THIS. NOW, LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT --
GET RIGHT TO IT.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT HARD HITTING. YOU'VE SEEN THE SHOW BEFORE, YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jimmy: I JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU BECAUSE WELL, WE WERE HOPING THAT YOU WERE GONNA PLAY THIS SUNDAY AND THEN WE JUST FOUND OUT YOU'RE NOT PLAYING THIS SUNDAY.
YEAH, IT'S TOUGH. SO, I'VE BEEN BATTLING THIS CALF INJURY FOR SOME WEEKS NOW AND I WAS SLATED TO GO BACK TO PRACTICE THIS WEEK, BUT I REAGGRAVATED IT, UNFORTUNATELY. BUT NO ONE KNOWS MORE THAN ME HOW MUCH I WANT TO BE OUT THERE ON THAT FIELD PLAYING WITH MY TEAMMATES. I MEAN, MY -- EMOTIONALLY, IT'S BEEN KIND OF DRAINING TO ME GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THE CALF, BUT I'M HAPPY TO BEGIN THE REHAB STAGES. IT'S NOT AS BAD AS IT WAS THE ORIGINAL TIME. SO, THAT'S POSITIVE NEWS.
Jimmy: BUT DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED? YOU WERE JUST NOT -- NO COLLISION WITH ANOTHER PLAYER. THIS WAS JUST SOMETHING POPPED.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
THAT WAS THE RIGHT PATELLAR TENDON. I DID THAT A YEAR AGO.
Jimmy: PATELLAR?
YEAH, THE RIGHT -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I'M LEARNING A LOT TONIGHT. THE PATELLAR TENDON.
THE PATELLAR TENDON. YEAH, IT'S THE ONE THAT KIND OF CONNECTS YOUR KNEECAP TO YOUR THIGH, THE REST OF YOUR LEG.
Jimmy: AND YOU'RE JUST RUNNING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING HAPPENED.
JUST RUNNING AND I FELT A A TENDON POP AND I HEARD IT IMMEDIATELY. I WENT TO THE GROUND, MAN. HUGGING MY KNEE FOR DEAR LIFE.
Jimmy: AND NOW, GROWING UP WITH FOOTBALL, HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN INJURY AND YOU GO LIKE, OH, MAN, PLEASE. THIS IS JUST GONNA SIDELINE ME.
THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE. THAT INJURY WAS THE FIRST ONE, YOU KNOW, WHENEVER YOU HEAR SOMETHING POP INSIDE YOUR BODY, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT GOOD. YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S NEVER GOOD.
Jimmy: ESPECIALLY -- BUT WHEN IT'S YOUR CAREER.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: THIS IS YOUR WHOLE LIFE ON THE LINE. THIS IS CRAZY.
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU LITERALLY SEE YOUR ENTIRE CAREER FLASH BEFORE YOUR EYES. BUT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. YOU KNOW THAT THE HARD WORK YOU PUT IN IN THAT REHAB STAGE IS GONNA PREVAIL AND YOU'RE GONNA BE BETTER ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY. OF COURSE YOU ARE. AND WE LOVE YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND WE WISH YOU THE BEST. DO WE KNOW -- DO WE KNOW WHEN YOU MAY BE ABLE TO PLAY AGAIN? DO YOU SEE THE DOCTOR? YOU MUST SEE HIM EVERY DAY.
I SEE HIM ALMOST EVERY HOUR. I'VE GOT HIM ON SPEED DIAL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HE LIVES WITH YOU NOW.
EXACTLY. HE LIVES OUT BACK.
Jimmy: YEAH.
NO, I SEE HIM ON MONDAY. THIS COMING MONDAY AND HE'S GONNA GIVE ME KIND OF HIS ASSESSMENT ON HOW HE FEELS MY CALF IS DOING AND A POTENTIAL TIMETABLE. SO WE'LL SEE.
Jimmy: YEAH, AND IT'D BE SILLY FOR YOU TO JUST GO OUT THERE AND JUST DO IT BECAUSE IF YOU END UP GETTING HURT FOR LONGER, THEN IT'S -- THEN YOU'RE REALLY OUT.
EXACTLY. AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME SEE ME IN THE HOSPITAL AND BRING ME CANDY AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WHICH I WOULD DO NORMALLY ANYWAY, YEAH.
OF COURSE. OF COURSE.
Jimmy: WELL, I WANNA TALK ABOUT THE DOCUMENTARY, WHICH WE LEARN A LOT ABOUT YOU. ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW IS THAT YOU HAVE A GIANT SNEAKER COLLECTION.
YES.
Jimmy: I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL THESE -- HOW MANY SNEAKERS DO YOU HAVE?
A LOT. SOMEWHERE AROUND 3 TO 400 PAIR RIGHT NOW, I THINK.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOSH.
LISTEN, JIMMY, I COULD BE ADDICTED TO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. I'LL TAKE SNEAKERS.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S TRUE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT IS TRUE. BUT HERE'S THE COOL THING. YOU TEAMED UP WITH NIKE AND YOU CREATED YOUR OWN SHOE?
YES, I CREATED MY OWN SHOE, WHICH I'M WEARING RIGHT NOW.

YES.
Jimmy: WHY'D YOU WANNA MAKE THE DOCUMENTARY, AND ARE THEY STILL MAKING THE DOCUMENTARY?
THE DOCUMENTARY IS ALMOST DONE.
Jimmy: 'CAUSE THERE'S NO ENDING.
YES, EXACTLY. SO ONCE I PHYSICALLY GET BACK ONTO THE FIELD, THAT'S WHEN THE FINAL CHAPTER OF THE DOCUMENTARY WILL BE DONE. I WANTED TO MAKE THIS DOCUMENTARY BECAUSE, A, I JUST HAD A LOT OF TIME ON MY HANDS WITH THE PATELLAR TENDON AND I JUST WANTED TO FILL THE TIME.
Jimmy: SO, YOU WANTED TO MAKE A MOVIE.
EXACTLY.
Jimmy: SO YOU AUDITIONED FOR STEVE WOZNIAK, YOU DIDN'T GET THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] SORRY ABOUT THAT. AND SO, YOU FIGURED YOU'D BE GREAT AT PLAYING YOU, VICTOR CRUZ.
EXACTLY, AND JUST I WANTED TO GIVE THE PEOPLE, THE FANS, EVERYONE THAT FOLLOWS MYSELF AND THE GIANTS JUST AN IN DEPTH LOOK OF MY JOURNEY, NOT JUST WITH THE PATELLAR TENDON AND COMING BACK FROM AND INJURY, BUT MY LIFE. WHERE I CAME FROM IN MY OWN WORDS, THE THINGS THAT I'VE GONE THROUGH, THE UPS AND DOWNS, THE LEFTS AND RIGHTS. ALL FROM MY OWN MOUTH. SO, I FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN A A LOT OF STORIES OUT THERE, BUT NEVER SOMETHING ORGANIC FROM MY MOUTH TO THE VIEWER.
Jimmy: I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. TAKE A LOOK AT "I AM GIANT, VICTOR CRUZ." CHECK IT OUT.
I GET THE HAND OFF.
COME ON, VIC. COME ON, VIC.

TERRIBLE FORM. LIKE MY ARMS ARE FLAILING.
I HEAR, VICTOR CRUZ, TOUCHDOWN! YOU KNOW, HE'S SO LITTLE HE'S RUNNING OFF THE FIELD.
