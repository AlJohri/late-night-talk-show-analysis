OF COURSE, LAST NIGHT WAS SUPER BOWL 50. DID YOU SEE IT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT WAS GREAT. IT'S THAT SPECIAL NIGHT WHERE AMERICANS GATHER WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO LOSE MONEY AND GAIN WEIGHT. AND IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFUL THING. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO THE DENVER BRONCOS, WHO BEAT THE CAROLINA PANTHERS BY THE SCORE OF 24-10. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CONGRATULATIONS. IT WAS WILD. THE BRONCOS REALLY STOPPED CAM NEWTON. IN FACT, THE ONLY DABBING HE WAS DOING WAS LAST NIGHT WAS SOME KLEENEX. [ LAUGHTER ] HE JUST WAS DOING A COUPLE DABS RIGHT THERE. HE WAS UPSET. HE WAS UPSET. AND HE SHOULD BE. AND HE SHOULD BE. BUT IT WASN'T ALL BAD NEWS FOR CAM NEWTON. HE WAS NAMED THE NFL'S MOST VALUABLE PLAYER AT THE NFL HONORS ON SATURDAY NIGHT. SO CONGRATS TO CAM NEWTON ON THAT. [ APPLAUSE ] THEY GAVE HIM THE AWARD. CEREMONY WENT WELL, BUT IT GOT WEIRD WHEN THE DENVER BRONCOS' DEFENSE TOOK THE AWARD OUT OF HIS HANDS AND RAN IT IN FOR A A TOUCHDOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE. BUT IT WAS EMBARRASSING. AND DID YOU SEE THIS? AFTER PEYTON MANNING WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS FUTURE, HE RESPONDED BY SAYING, "I'LL DRINK A LOT OF BUDWEISER TONIGHT."

[ LAUGHTER ] IT'S FINE. NO ONE WILL TELL ME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT." AFTER THE SUPER BOWL, SEVERAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ACTUALLY TOOK SOME TIME TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE GAME. HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID. JEB BUSH SAID, "PEYTON DID A A GREAT JOB, BUT LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER ELI, WHO IS ALSO A GOOD FOOTBALL CANDIDATE." [ APPLAUSE ] THAT'S NICE. MARCO RUBIO SAID, "PEYTON KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING. PEYTON KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING. PEYTON KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING."

PIZZA GUY, YEAH. OTHER BIG NEWS, OF COURSE, IS THE BIG REPUBLICAN DEBATE ON SATURDAY NIGHT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHICH GOT OFF TO A PRETTY ROCKY START. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW, BUT APPARENTLY BEN CARSON DIDN'T HEAR HIS NAME YELLED OUT OR SOMETHING. SO HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO OUT ONTO THE STAGE.

Jimmy: HE'S A VERY -- VERY CUTE KID. DID YOU TAKE HIM TO ITALY WHEN YOU SHOT "ZOOLANDER."
YEAH WE SHOT THE WHOLE MOVIE IN ITALY AND THE KIDS CAME OVER, NOT FOR THE WHOLE TIME. BUT WHEN THEY CAME OVER, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO FIND THINGS FOR THEM TO DO. AND YOU KNOW, SO LIKE WE FOUND LIKE, THERE'S PIZZA MAKING CLASSES AND SCAVENGER HUNTS THROUGH ROME TO FIND THE DIFFERENT SITES TO MAKE IT INTERESTING FOR THE KIDS.
Jimmy: THAT'S FUN.

Jimmy: YOU WERE IN A SUPER BOWL COMMERCIAL?
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN A A SUPER BOWL COMMERCIAL.
Jimmy: OH, NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT DIDN'T -- YOU DIDN'T GET TO DO IT OR SOMETHING?
NO, NO, NO, I DID IT. THEY JUST BUMPED IT. THEY DIDN'T SHOW IT. AT THE LAST MINUTE. [ AUDIENCE AWES ]
Jimmy: THAT'S UNFAIR. I MEAN THIS IS -- WHAT WAS IT FOR?
FEMALE VIAGRA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: FEMALE VIAGRA, I DIDN'T KNOW THEY MADE COMMERCIALS FOR THAT.
YEAH, YEAH, I MEAN, ALL THE ADS FOR MALE VIAGRA OUT THERE. BUT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THERE'S FEMALE VIAGRA. AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET THE WORD OUT. SO I DID THIS SPOT. MORE LIKE A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT.
Jimmy: MORE LIKE A PUBLIC SERVICE THAN A COMMERCIAL.
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THIS VIAGRA ADS WITH LIKE GIRL AND SHE'S ON THE BED IN A A FOOTBALL JERSEY.

I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT. BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON THERE WAS A MIX-UP AND THEY JUST SORT OF -- YOU KNOW, THEY BUMPED IT AT THE LAST MINUTE. STILL A LITTLE RAW, SO.

Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M SORRY. I'M BEING TOLD THAT WE HAVE THE CLIP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GUYS, CHECK THIS OUT. HERE'S BEN STILLER'S NEW AD FOR FEMALE VIAGRA.
WATCHING FOOTBALL TOGETHER IS GREAT. BUT I THINK MOST MEN WOULD AGREE CUDDLING WITH THEIR WOMAN AFTER THE GAME IS PRETTY DAMN MAGICAL. THE THING IS EVEN THOUGH ZERO WOMEN SUFFER FROM ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION. OVER 98% OF WOMEN OVER 30 SUFFER FROM ANOTHER CONDITION, CALLED "NOT BEING TURNED ON BY THEIR HUSBAND ANYMORE." [ LAUGHTER ] FEMALE VIAGRA HELPS WOMEN GET IN THE MOOD AND STAY IN THE MOOD. AND YOU ONLY TAKE IT WHEN YOU NEED IT, LIKE ANNIVERSARIES, SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR WHEN YOUR HUSBAND ROLLS OVER AND SAYS, "WANT TO HAVE SEX?" [ LAUGHTER ]
ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU'RE MENTALLY PREPARED TO SEE YOUR HUSBAND WITHOUT HIS SHIRT ON. [ LAUGHTER ] SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE DIZZINESS, NAUSEA, HAVING SEX WITH YOUR HUSBAND, YOUR HUSBAND SAYING, "SORRY, WAS THAT OKAY?" AND IF YOUR HUSBAND IS OVER 70, NIGHTMARES. [ LAUGHTER ] IF SEX WITH YOUR HUSBAND LASTS MORE THAN FOUR MINUTES, GOD HELP YOU. JUST FAKE IT AND PRETEND TO GO TO SLEEP OR TELL HIM YOU HAVE A A HEADACHE, WHICH INCIDENTALLY IS ANOTHER SIDE EFFECT OF FEMALE VIAGRA. [ LAUGHTER ]
ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF FEMALE VIAGRA IS RIGHT FOR YOU. GO SUPER BOWL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THAT. THAT WAS A GREAT COMMERCIAL.
I'M HOPING IT'S GOING TO FIND ITS AUDIENCE.
