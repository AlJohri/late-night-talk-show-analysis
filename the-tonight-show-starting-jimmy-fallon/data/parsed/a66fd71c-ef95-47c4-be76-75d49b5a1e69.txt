THAT'S RIGHT, A GUY KNOWN FOR BRILLIANTLY INSULTING EVERYONE IN THE ROOM. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] OR AS DONALD TRUMP CALLS HIM, "THE ORIGINAL ME." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT. LAST NIGHT WAS THE VOTERS' FIRST REPUBLICAN FORUM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THIS IS WHERE ALL THE CANDIDATES GOT TOGETHER FOR SOME TOUGH TALK ABOUT THE ELECTION. AND AT ONE POINT, SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID HIS FOREIGN POLICY WOULD BE A CHOICE BETWEEN A CLINCHED FIST AND AN OPEN HAND. I HOPE HE GETS ELECTED, JUST SO I CAN HEAR MORE OF HIS -- [ LAUGHTER ] MORE OF HIS THREATS. [ APPLAUSE ] "WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE PUTIN? YOU WANT THE DWAYNE JOHNSON OR DO YOU WANT THE REAL HOUSEWIFE?" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT? ♪♪ "YOU TELL ME, WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?" [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. LINDSEY GRAHAM ALSO PRAISED THE DAYS WHEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WOULD WORK TOGETHER AND GET DRINKS AFTERWARDS. IN FACT, HE EVEN SAID, QUOTE, "MAYBE WE NEED TO DRINK MORE IN WASHINGTON." [ LAUGHTER ] THEN SOMEONE TOLD HIM, "SENATOR GRAHAM, THE DEBATE IS OVER. YOU'RE TALKING TO THE LAMP." [ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S A LAMP! YOU WANT THE FIST OR YOU WANT A A REAL HOUSEWIFE?" [ LAUGHTER ] GRAHAM SAID A LOT DURING THE FORUM, BUT AT ONE POINT IT SEEMED HE HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE EXPRESSING HIMSELF. CHECK THIS OUT.
THE NEXT PRESIDENT NEEDS TO BE SURE OF WHO OR HE SHE -- WHO OR HE SHE -- I'M SORRY. I CAN'T -- I CAN'T TALK. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WHO -- HE, SHE, WHO -- WHO, SHE, HE'S WHO -- SHE SEE -- HE SAYS, THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE GOT THE HEAD START ON THAT DRINKING IN WASHINGTON. HE DID A GOOD JOB. AT ONE POINT DURING LAST NIGHT'S GOP FORUM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE MODERATOR GAVE EACH CANDIDATE 30 SECONDS TO SUM UP THEIR MESSAGE TO AMERICAN VOTERS. AND IF YOU MISSED IT, DON'T WORRY, HERE'S A 30-SECOND SUMMARY OF EACH OF THOSE 30-SECOND SUMMARIES. TAKE A LOOK. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
WELL, THE REAL ISSUE FOR US IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY IS WHAT'S HAPPENING ALL ACROSS --

Jimmy: I KNOW, BUT -- I'M SORRY, I WAS GOING TO SPRING IT ON YOU. BUT I'M SUCH A BIG FAN OF YOURS FROM BACK IN THE DAY.
WOW, YOU'RE A FAN OF THE "SUGAR BEATS," HUH?
Jimmy: YEAH, YOU WERE IN A A CHILDREN'S SINGING GROUP WHEN YOU WERE A KID. AND WE FOUND A CD FROM THE "THE SUGAR BEATS." AND THIS IS THE DEBUT, HOW MANY RECORDS DID YOU END UP MAKING?
I MADE, I THINK FOUR.
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT THIS ALBUM WAS SPECIAL FOR ME. BECAUSE I HAD MY VERY FIRST SOLO IN THIS ALBUM.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT YOU DID.
I WAS A BACKUP SINGER FROM THE AGE OF NINE, TIL I THINK FOURTEEN.
Jimmy: HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED WITH -- HOW DID YOU MAKE A RECORD AS A KID? DID YOU PLAY EVERYWHERE? DID YOU GO TO TALENT SHOWS?
NO, NO. IT WAS EASIER THAN THAT.
Jimmy: WOW.
CAROLE KING'S DAUGHTER, SHERRY CONDOR LIVED ACROSS THE STREET FROM ME WHEN I WAS NINE. AND SHE WAS MAKING THIS -- SHE HAD THIS IDEA TO MAKE THIS ALBUM, AND I AUDITIONED FOR IT. AND THAT WAS THE START OF IT ALL.
Jimmy: NO WAY!
YEAH.
Jimmy: WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU SINGING.
NO, YOU DON'T.
Jimmy: YEAH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, WE DO.
NO YOU DON'T.
Jimmy: THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. IT'S SO CUTE. HERE IS KATE MARA SINGING "WALK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN." ♪♪ ♪ GOLD CROCODILES OH WHEY OH THEY SNAP THEIR TEETH ON YOUR FINGERTIPS ♪ ♪ FOREIGN TYPES WITH THE SODA POPS SAY AY OH WHEY OH AY OH WHEY OH

WE HAVE TO GET DEEPER NOW. ♪ WALK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN ♪
Jimmy: AW, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. COME ON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
Jimmy: THAT'S NOT EASY FOR A A LITTLE KID TO DO THAT. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. I'M A GIANT FAN OF YOURS FROM "HOUSE OF CARDS." BUT I'M NOT SURE IF I'M ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING ABOUT THAT SHOW BECAUSE I DON'T REALY GET --
OH, IT'S BEEN ENOUGH TIME.
Jimmy: NO, IT HASN'T.
REALLY?
Jimmy: YEAH, I'M TELLING YOU. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVEN'T SEEN "HOUSE OF CARDS" YET? FOUR OR FIVE PEOPLE. SO FIVE PEOPLE OUT THERE --
YOU GUYS SHOULD JUST LEAVE.
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. DON'T LEAVE! BUT I FEEL LIKE WHEN NETFLIX COMES OUT WITH ALL THE SHOWS AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S TOUGH TO TALK ABOUT THEM, BECAUSE YOU GO -- DID YOU --
RIGHT.
Jimmy: HOW MANY EPISODES HAVE YOU SEEN?
I'M JUST NOT SENSITIVE ABOUT IT ANYMORE.
Jimmy: OH, I AM. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE YOU'RE SO GOOD IN IT, AND I DON'T WANT TO RUIN ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY. BECAUSE IT'S A REAL --
OH, WELL THANK YOU.
Jimmy: IT'S A REAL FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE, AND IT'S SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENS.
SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENS, YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU -- WHEN YOU COME TO NEW YORK, DO YOU GET NERVOUS WHEN YOU --
I TAKE THE SUBWAY ALL OF THE TIME.
Jimmy: YOU TAKE THE SUBWAY? OH, OKAY -- THAT'S GOOD, OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] LET'S -- FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO GET THAT, YOU GET THAT. LET'S TALK ABOUT "FANTASTIC FOUR."
OKAY.
Jimmy: THIS IS THE BIG NEW SUPER HERO MOVIE. OH MY GOSH. MY MAN, MILES TELLER, HOW MUCH DO WE LOVE THAT GUY?
I LOVE HIM.
Jimmy: WE ARE BIG FANS --
HE'S THE BEST.
Jimmy: DAY ONE, WE LOVE THAT GUY. [ APPLAUSE ]
YEAH, HE'S THE BEST.
Jimmy: MICHAEL B. JORDAN, YOU HAVE JAMIE BELL. THIS IS A BIG DEAL. THIS IS AWESOME.
YEAH.
Jimmy: AND I FOUND OUT -- YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT THE -- YOU AUDITIONED AND FOUND OUT YOU GOT THE ROLE FROM TWITTER?
YEAH, I WAS SORT OF LIKE WAITING PATIENTLY. I THOUGHT I MIGHT FIND OUT ABOUT IT THE DAY THAT IT ALL HAPPENED AND NO ONE WAS CALLING ME AND SO I WAS JUST SCROLLING TWITTER AND THERE IT WAS. I THINK, LIKE, "THE PLAYLIST" OR SOMETHING TWEETED ABOUT IT.
Jimmy: THEY LEAKED IT OUT?
OR "DEADLINE" -- SOMETHING. AND I CALLED MY AGENT, AND THEY CONFIRMED.
Jimmy: UH ER UH, CONGRATULATIONS? WE'RE GOING TO SEND CHAMPAGNE OVER RIGHT NOW. YEAH. HOW EXCITING IS THAT?
ISN'T THAT WEIRD?
Jimmy: BUT IT'S A BIG GIANT SUPERHERO MOVIE -- YOU'RE A A SUPER HERO.
APPARENTLY -- YEAH.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S GREAT. THIS IS FANTASTIC!
THANKS. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I'M HAPPY FOR YOU AND I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE A CLIP. HERE IS KATE MARA AND MILES TELLER IN THE "FANTASTIC FOUR." TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
AMAZING.
OH, THANKS.
AMAZING YOU DIDN'T BLACK OUT THE ENTIRE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.
HMM?
YOU BASICALLY RIPPED A HOLE IN THE FABRIC OF SPACE TIME WITH UNSPECED COMPONENTS AND NO SUPERVISION.
YES, THAT WAS -- AN ACCIDENT.
AND IF BY ACCIDENT YOU UPPED THE POWER, YOU WOULD HAVE CREATED A RUNWAY REACTION THAT OPENED A BLACK HOLE AND SWALLOWED THE ENTIRE PLANET.
WELL, I'M GLAD THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: KATE MARA, EVERYBODY! "FANTASTIC FOUR" IS IN THEATRES THIS FRIDAY! GO SEE IT! PENN & TELLER JOIN US NEXT! STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

GIVE IT UP FOR PENN & TELLER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. BUT BEFORE WE START, I JUST WANTED TO SAY, I KNOW YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE OTHER DAY AND THAT'S WHEN I HAD MY ACCIDENT WITH MY FINGER.
YEAH.
Jimmy: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK ON, BECAUSE YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
WELL, THANKS FOR MAKING TIME FOR US.
Jimmy: AND I WANTED TO CONGRATULATE YOU THEN. I'LL DO IT NOW. "TIM'S VERMEER." IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN THIS DOCUMENTARY -- YOU DIRECTED IT, RIGHT.
TELLER DIRECTED IT. YEAH, I PRODUCED IT. WE WROTE IT TOGETHER, YEAH.
Jimmy: YOU WATCH THIS DOCUMENTARY YOU WON'T EVEN BELIEVE WHAT YOU SEE. IT'S SOMETHING I JUST CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE, BUT FASCINATING. I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END. BUT ANYWAYS, IT'S ON iTUNES AND NETFLIX. CHECK IT ALL OUT. IT'S JUST -- ANYWAY, CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
THANK YOU.
Jimmy: THANK YOU FOR MAKING THAT MOVIE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU NEVER STOP WORKING. I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER COME BACK TO NEW YORK.
YEAH, WELL, IT WAS TOUGH.
Jimmy: YEAH.
IT WAS TOUGH BECAUSE WE'RE IN VEGAS, AND IT TURNS OUT WHEN THEY NAME THE THEATER AFTER YOU AND PAINT YOUR PICTURE 300 FEET TALL ON THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL, AND YOU TELL THEM WE WANT TO GO TO A DIFFERENT PLACE AND DO A A SHOW FOR A WHILE, THEY GET ANGRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: I FEEL LIKE --
AND THEY'RE VEGAS, SO WHEN THEY GET ANGRY, IT MATTERS.
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. YOU DON'T MESS AROUND THAT.
DON'T MONKEY WITH THEM.
Jimmy: SO YOU'RE ONLY HERE UNTIL AUGUST --
JUST DOING SIX WEEKS, SO AUGUST 16th.
Jimmy: SIX WEEKS. AUGUST 16th, PENNANDTELLERONBROADWAY.COM TO GET TICKETS IF YOU WANT TO GO CHECK THIS OUT. WHAT TRICKS ARE YOU PERFORMING AT -- DURING THE SHOW?
WELL, WE'RE DOING -- WE BROUGHT STUFF WE HAVEN'T DONE OUTSIDE OF VEGAS EVER. WE'RE GONNA BE -- WE VANISH AN ELEPHANT ON STAGE WHICH HASN'T BEEN DONE IN NEW YORK SINCE HOUDINI. WE'RE DOING THAT. AND WE'RE DOING STUFF THAT'S 40 YEARS OLD. WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER 40 YEARS. AND ALSO STUFF THAT'S BRAND-NEW. WE TRIED TO MAKE THIS -- SINCE OUR 40th ANNIVERSARY IS AUGUST 15th OR SOMETHING? WE TRIED TO MAKE THIS KIND OF A A CELEBRATION OF THAT.
Jimmy: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S BEEN 40 YEARS.
YEAH, 40 YEARS.
Jimmy: IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL TO ME.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: AND ALWAYS SOMETHING ORIGINAL, ALWAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
AND WE'VE BEEN ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW" WITH DON RICKLES. WHICH IS ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS.
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT REALLY MATTERS. DON RICKLES WAS OUT HERE. I KNOW, EXACTLY. BUT EVERY TIME, YOU ALWAYS COME UP WITH NEW AND ORIGINAL AND FRESH TAKES ON EVERYTHING. THAT'S WHAT I GOTTA RESPECT ABOUT YOU GUYS. BECAUSE YOU NEVER STOP. SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING -- WHAT TRICK ARE YOU DOING FOR US TONIGHT?
WELL, YOU KNOW, TELLER ASKED ME IF I HAD EVER SEEN A A MAGICIAN PULL A RABBIT OUT OF A HAT. AND I REALIZED, I'D NEVER SEEN THAT TRICK. AND THEN TELLER TOLD ME HE HADN'T EITHER. AND THAT'S WEIRD, BECAUSE THAT'S A CLICHé. YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMEONE RECOGNIZES ME -- IT HAPPENED TO ME IN TIMES SQUARE, THEY'LL GO, "HEY, MAGIC BOY! PULL A RABBIT OUT OF YOUR HAT!" YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
AND YOU'RE GOING TO DRAW -- IF YOU'RE GONNA DRAW A A MAGICIAN, YOU DRAW A TOP HAT AND A WAND AND A HAT, AND I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT TRICK LIVE. AND MAYBE SOME OF YOU HAVEN'T EITHER. AND THERE'S REASONS FOR THAT. ONE, IT'S REALLY HARD MAGIC. IT'S WICKED HARD. AND ANOTHER REASON, IT'S KIND OF AN ANACHRONISM. IN 19th CENTURY FRANCE, WHEN IT BECAME A CLICHé, AT A FORMAL GATHERING, PEOPLE WORE TOP HATS, YOU KNOW?
Jimmy: YEAH.
BUT NOW UNLESS SOMEONE'S REALLY INTO COSPLAY OR THERE'S A STEAMPUNK CONVENTION IN TOWN YOU DON'T SEE 'EM VERY OFTEN. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: STEAMPUNK, YEAH.
COULD WE LOAN THIS TO YOU FOR A MOMENT?
Jimmy: SURE.
JUST FOR A SEC. I JUST WANT YOU TO GET A SENSE AND TRY IT ON A LITTLE BIT. SO WHAT MAGICIANS WILL DO -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: WOW.
IS THEY WILL USE A A REPRESENTATION OF A TOP HAT. LIKE, THEY'LL HAVE A A HANDKERCHIEF, MAGICIANS CALL IT SILK, AND THEY'LL DRAW A TOP HAT ON IT AND THEN DO SOME SILK TRICKS, AND THEN FROM A PICTURE OF A TOP HAT, THEY'LL DO A -- THEY'LL SHOW THAT THEIR HAND EMPTY AND THEN PULL OUT A A RABBIT. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] BUT THAT'S A RABBIT OUT OF A A HANDKERCHIEF. IT'S OUT OF A SILK. IT'S NOT A REAL TOP HAT AND IT'S ALSO NOT A REAL RABBIT. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED A KICKER. THEY'RE SOLD AT MAGIC STORES. IT'S A PIECE OF SPRING WITH SOME FUR ON IT, AND IF YOU PUPPETEER IT PROPERLY, AND TELLER DOES, IT LOOKS LIKE A A REAL RABBIT FROM, YOU KNOW, BACK OF THE FOURTH BALCONY OR SOMETHING.
Jimmy: SURE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
AND IT SOLVES A LOT OF PROBLEMS. YOU CAN DO SOMETHING WITH A A KICKER YOU CAN'T DO WITH A A REAL RABBIT. YOU CAN PRESS IT, IT PALM IT. YOU CAN ALSO HIDE IT UP YOUR SLEEVE. AND IT ALSO SOLVES THE ETHICAL PROBLEM. OVER THE PAST FEW HUNDRED YEARS, HUMANITY'S SPHERE OF COMPASSION HAS GROWN AND WE NOW WANT ANIMALS TREATED WITH COMPASSION, DIGNITY AND RESPECT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO YOU MAY --
Jimmy: FAKE RABBIT.
YOU MAY HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT TRICK.
Jimmy: NO. BUT IF WE HAVE -- DOES ANYBODY HAVE A TOP HAT? DO YOU -- CAN WE BORROW THIS TOP HAT?
Jimmy: SURE.
IS IT EMPTY? DID YOU CHECK IT OUT?
Jimmy: IT'S EMPTY. YEAH, I JUST WORE IT.
AND YOU COLLAPSED IT, AND YOU OPENED IT UP.
Jimmy: YEP.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW IT'S EMPTY. WE'RE GONNA SHOW IT TO THE AUDIENCE, BUT IT'S BLACK ON BLACK. AND HERE'S THE WAND, AND HERE'S THE TRICK, JIMMY, YOU MAY NEVER HAVE SEEN. BORROWED TOP HAT, MAGIC GESTURE, TWO TAPS, AND OUT OF THE HAT COMES A RABBIT. THAT'S HOCKEY PUCK, THE RABBIT, NAMED AFTER DON RICKLES.
Jimmy: OH MY GOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S A REAL RABBIT.
AND I WANT TO MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR --
Jimmy: HOW DOES THIS SOLVE THE --
YOU WERE TREATED WITH COMPASSION AND DIGNITY AND RESPECT.
Jimmy: SURE.
SURE, SURE.
Jimmy: OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S HOCKEY PUCK! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I'M -- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
NOW YOU'VE SEEN A RABBIT OUT OF A HAT.
Jimmy: PENN & TELLER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! "PENN & TELLER: FOOL US" AIRS MONDAYS AT 8:00 P.M. ON THE CW. GO SEE THEM, "PENN & TELLER ON BROADWAY" AT THE MARQUIS THEATRE UNTIL AUGUST 16th. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: MY THANKS TO DON RICKLES, KATE MARA, PENN & TELLER, ONCE AGAIN, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOCKEY PUCK, AND THIS LITTLE GUY HERE, KICKER. JOE SATRIANI, OF COURSE. THANK YOU, BUDDY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THE ROOTS. THE ROOTS FROM PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. STAY TUNED FOR "LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS." THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. HAVE A GREAT NIGHT. I HOPE TO SAY YOU TOMORROW. GOODBYE, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
