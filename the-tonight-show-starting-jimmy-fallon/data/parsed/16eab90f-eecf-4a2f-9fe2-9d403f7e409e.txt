Steve: AND NOW, HERE HE IS, JIMMY FALLON! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! HOW YOU DOING? WELCOME TO THE SHOW! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. OH! OH, MY GOODNESS! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! HOT CROWD! OH, THE BEST CROWD. NEW YORK CITY. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE TONIGHT SHOW." THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, YOU GUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] A FUN SHOW. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN TONIGHT. WE'LL HAVE FUN TONIGHT. HERE'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS. I SAW THAT THIS WEEK'S SENATE REPORT ON THE CIA'S INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES SUGGESTED THAT GEORGE BUSH AND DICK CHENEY DID NOT KNOW THE LOCATION OF THE DETENTION FACILITY. THEN CHENEY WAS LIKE, PART OF THE THRILL WAS FINDING THEM ON MY OWN. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WHERE IS IT? THAT'S RIGHT. GEORGE BUSH AND DICK CHENEY MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN THE LOCATION OF THE DETENTION FACILITIES. THOUGH IN FAIRNESS IT TOOK BUSH THREE YEARS TO FIGURE OUT THE LOCATION OF THE WHITE HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] IS IT WASHINGTON STATE? PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE? IT'S VERY CONFUSING. SPEAKING OF THE WHITE HOUSE, YESTERDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE FIRST LADY DONATED SOME HOLIDAY GIFTS TO TOYS FOR TOTS. AND THE PRESIDENT EVEN CAME OUT IN CHARACTER. CHECK IT OUT. [ APPLAUSE ]
HO HO HO! HO HO HO! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: HA HA HA HA. HA HA. DID YOU HEAR THE FIRST LADY FAKE LAUGH? HA HA HA. HA HA HA. HA HA HA. I CAN'T WAIT FOR 2016. AH HA HA HA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HO HO HO! THAT'S RIGHT. HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON THOUGH. CONGRESS MANAGED TO AVOID ANOTHER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN BY AGREEING ON A $1.1 TRILLION SPENDING BILL. OF COURSE, TO GET ANYTHING PASSED IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, THEY HAD TO DO A LOT OF COMPROMISING. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IN TONIGHT'S EDITION OF "SPLITTIN' THE DIFF." [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪
Jimmy: TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FIRST COMPROMISE. THE DEMOCRATS WANTED MORE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL LUNCHES. THE REPUBLICANS WANTED MORE IMMIGRANTS DEPORTED TO MEXICO. SO THEY COMPROMISED. NOW IMMIGRANTS BEING DEPORTED WILL RECEIVE SCHOOL LUNCH ON THE WAY OUT. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT. YOU HAVE TO COMPROMISE.
Steve: SPLITTING THE DIFF.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO DO IT.
Steve: YOU GOT TO SPILT THE DIFF.
Jimmy: HERE'S ANOTHER ONE HERE. THE REPUBLICANS WANTED TO EXPAND GUN RIGHTS. THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO EXPAND ANIMAL RIGHTS. SO THEIR COMPROMISE IS TO GIVE GUNS TO BEARS. AND THAT'S -- [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Steve: ANIMAL RIGHTS. IT'S THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
Jimmy: THE RIGHT TO --
Steve: THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
Jimmy: THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS. THE RIGHT TO ARM -- [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT TO ARM BEARS.
Steve: YEAH, EXACTLY.
Jimmy: ABSOLUTELY.
Steve: SPLIT THE DIFF.
Jimmy: AND FINALLY, THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO PROTECT ALL THE NATIONAL PARKS. THE REPUBLICANS WANTED TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF SENIOR CITIZENS. THEY COMPROMISED, AND NOW LARRY KING HAS TO BE FORCED TO LIVE IN THE FOREST. [ LAUGHTER ] HE HAS TO SURVIVE. HE'S DOING IT FOR THE COUNTRY. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A A PINECONE? [ LAUGHTER ] UH -- THIS IS GOING VIRAL TODAY. NFL STAR MARSHAWN LYNCH GAVE A A RARE INTERVIEW THIS WEEK AMID SPECULATION THAT HE MIGHT RETIRE AT THE END OF THIS SEASON. OKAY, AND HE WAS ASKED TO DEFINE BEAST MODE. TELL US, WHAT IS BEAST MODE? CHECK OUT WHAT HE SAID.
I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET GOT. BUT I'M GOING TO GET MINE MORE THAN I GET GOT, THOUGH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: OH, THAT SUMS IT UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT ELEANOR ROOSEVELT SAID THAT FIRST. YOU KNOW, THAT'S VERY FAMOUS. GOING TO GET GOT BUT YOU GOT TO GET GOT BEFORE YOU GET -- YEAH. THIS IS JUST -- JUST WEIRD. THERE'S A NEW STUDY THAT SAYS MALE RATS CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SEXUAL FETISHES, AFTER SOME WERE FOUND TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO -- AND THIS IS REAL.  -- FEMALE RATS DRESSED IN LINGERIE. [ LAUGHTER ] FORGET ABOUT THE RATS. HOW ABOUT WE GOT TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE GUY WHO SPENDS HIS TIME MAKING TINY RAT LINGERIE? IT'S LIKE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] VICTOR'S SECRET. [ LAUGHTER ] MAKING RAT LINGERIE?
Steve: HONEY, ARE YOU IN THERE?

Steve: YOU GOT TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE!
Jimmy: OH, YEAH. ABSOLUTELY, MOM, NO PROBLEM. SHH, DON'T TELL ANYBODY. WHAT DOES YOUR SON DO? OH -- NEVER MIND. HE MAKES LINGERIE FOR RATS. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S A LOCAL STORY, YOU GUYS. THIS WEEKEND IS SANTACON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS WHERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DRESS UP LIKE SANTA AND GO FROM BAR TO BAR GETTING DRUNK. AND I SAW THAT IN PREPARATION FOR THE EVENT, THE ORGANIZATION HAS HIRED POPULAR CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER NORMAN SIEGEL TO REPRESENT THEM. THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO GET YOUR LIFE TOGETHER, WHEN YOU HIRE A LAWYER BEFORE YOU EVEN GO DRINKING. [ LAUGHTER ] MEETING MY FRIENDS. I'LL SEE YOU AT THE BAR. GOT TO GET A LAWYER, OF COURSE.
Steve: GOT TO GET MY RAT LINGERIE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: GOT MY RAT LINGERIE HERE.
Steve: RATS SPELLED BACKWARDS IS STAR. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: NO, NO, NO. VICTOR, IT DOESN'T MAKE A A DIFFERENCE. ♪♪ GUYS, GET THIS. I READ ABOUT A COMPANY IN NEW YORK THAT MAKES WINE-INFUSED ICE CREAM.

THANK YOU, MAN.

THAT'S RIGHT.
Jimmy: THE ONE THAT NO ONE LIKES, I LIKE. I GO, "I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY CANCELED THAT. THAT WAS SO BAD AND GOOD." I LOVE THEM. BUT THIS ONE ACTUALLY IS GREAT.
THANK YOU. THE IDEA -- WE OPENED UP A PRODUCTION COMPANY A COUPLE YEARS AGO, SEVEN BUCKS PRODUCTIONS. THE IDEA WAS TO CREATE SHOWS AND CONTENT THAT WAS ENTERTAINING, NUMBER ONE. AND IF WE CAN CREATE AN INSPIRING SHOW LIKE "WAKE-UP CALL," THEN WE WERE ABLE TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. SO, THE IDEA WITH "WAKE-UP CALL" IS -- AND I, LIKE YOU, LOVE REALITY. THE IDEA WAS TO CREATE A SHOW THAT DIDN'T HAVE A CASH PRIZE AT END. NOBODY GOT VOTED OFF. BUT IT WAS JUST PEOPLE WHO FELL ON HARD TIMES, TOUGH TIMES, AND I'M HELPING THEM GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. AND JUST GET BETTER. THAT'S WHAT THE SHOW IS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: I'M IN ALREADY. I'M IN.
THANK YOU, MAN.
Jimmy: I LOVE -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE, IT'S LIKE "MADE" THAT SHOW THEY HAD ON MTV.
RIGHT.
Jimmy: IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MORE -- THE PAYOFF. I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE ON HARD TIMES, MAN.
THEY ARE ON HARD TIMES. ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW, TODAY AND NOW.
Jimmy: SURE.
AND YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THE CASH PRIZE IS TRANSFORMATION. SO, WE TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, A KID WHO YOU'LL SEE IN THIS CLIP, 18-YEARS-OLD. HE DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL WHEN HE WAS IN THE EIGHTH GRADE. MOM WENT TO PRISON. DAD WASN'T AROUND. HE HAD A DREAM OF BECOMING A A UFC FIGHTER. I SHOWED UP ON HIS DOOR AND I SAID, "LISTEN, I'M GOING TO HELP YOU OUT." BUT THE DEAL IS WITH EVERYONE ON THE SHOW, YOU GOT TO PUT IN THE WORK. YOU PUT IN THE WORK AND I'LL MEET YOU HALFWAY. THIS IS A MOMENT THAT WE CAPTURED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. TOOK HIM TO A CHAIN GANG, BASICALLY, WHERE I SAW THERE WERE PRISONERS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THEY WERE DOING WORK. AND I TOOK HIM THERE TO GIVE HIM AN EXAMPLE OF IF HE DIDN'T STRAIGHTEN UP AND GET BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK, HE WAS GOING TO END UP HERE. WE HAD A PRETTY COOL MOMENT AND I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT.
Jimmy: HERE'S A CLIP. DWAYNE JOHNSON IN HIS NEW TNT SHOW, "WAKE-UP CALL." PREMIERING FRIDAY AT 9:00 P.M. CHECK THIS OUT.
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'S EVER TOLD YOU THIS, I DON'T KNOW, IT DOESN'T MATTER. BUT I'M TELLING YOU THIS. TYRELL, YOU ARE GOING TO BE A A GREAT MAN ONE DAY.

SO FAR, YOU'RE THIS. NO, YOU KNOW WHO I THINK THE MOST BORING INTERVIEW IS? AND I'VE TOLD HIM THIS. THE MOST BORING INTERVIEW IS WARREN BEATTY. I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
Jimmy: WARREN BEATTY?
IT TAKES FOREVER. YOU SAY TO HIM, "WHAT'S THE TITLE OF YOUR NEW MOVIE?" AND HE GOES, "UM -- LET ME THINK -- THE TITLE -- " WHO CARES? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD SPICE UP THAT INTERVIEW? GET HIM IN A BUBBLE BATH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] WARREN BEATTY. I'M GOING TO PUT THE CALL OUT. WARREN, IF YOU'RE WATCHING -- I KNOW HE IS WATCHING. LET'S DO THIS, BUDDY. ME AND HIM AND YOU.
OH, YOU AND HIM.
Jimmy: NO, THE THREE OF US.
DO YOU HEAR THAT? NOT ME AND HIM. NOT WARREN BEATTY AND ME. WARREN BEATTY AND HIM.
Jimmy: EITHER WAY, I CAN MAKE IT WORK.
I WILL NOT GO ON WITH THAT.
Jimmy: NO, OF COURSE NOT. BUT I SHOULD SAY YOU ANNOUNCED SOME OTHER NAMES THERE. BUT I WOULD SAY OPRAH WINFREY WAS VERY EXCITING. CHELSEA HANDLER. YOU'VE ANNOUNCED EIGHT PEOPLE TOTAL. AND YOU ALWAYS LEAVE OUT TWO SO THAT PEOPLE ARE GUESSING.
WELL, I LEAVE OUT ONE PRIMARILY, AND THAT'S THE MOST FASCINATING PERSON OF 2014.
Jimmy: CAN I GUESS?
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU WILL NEVER HAVE GUESSED IT. NOW, GO AHEAD AND GUESS IT. BUT I'M TELLING YOU, EVEN IF YOU GUESS IT, YOU WON'T HAVE GUESSED IT. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU GUESS IT, I WILL TELL YOU.
Jimmy: YOU'RE LIKE MARSHAWN LYNCH. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
IF YOU GUESS IT, I WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE RIGHT.
Jimmy: OKAY. POPE FRANCIS?
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GUESS. BUT IT ISN'T. BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT, BECAUSE THEY SAID TO ME BACKSTAGE THAT YOU HAD SUGGESTED IT, I HATED MYSELF. I THOUGHT, WHAT A GREAT CHOICE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN! AND IT WAS HIS IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: SEE! I THINK HE'D BE GREAT. HE'S A FASCINATING GUY.
YEAH, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.
Jimmy: BUT THERE'S A LOT OF FASCINATING PEOPLE I WOULD SAY THAT HAD GREAT YEARS. SO, I WOULD SAY -- AFTER LOOKING AT THIS LIST, I WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY SOMEONE POLITICAL.
NO, IT'S NOT SOMEONE -- WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY POLITICAL ON THE LIST.
Jimmy: WHAT?
LAST YEAR YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA. I'VE DONE PRESIDENT -- DONE -- I'VE DONE HIM. [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS A BUBBLE BATH! THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING FOR. YEAH. I MEAN, BY -- WELL, IT'S ALWAYS GREAT WHEN YOU COME ON.
I LOVE BEING ON WITH YOU. I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU HAVE THIS NEW EDITION TO YOUR LIFE.
Jimmy: OH, YOU'RE THE NICEST AND THE COOLEST AND THE BEST. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
