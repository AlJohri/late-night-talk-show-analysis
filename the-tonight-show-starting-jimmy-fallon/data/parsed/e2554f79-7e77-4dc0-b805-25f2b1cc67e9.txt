I LOVE BEING ON THE SHOW, JIMMY. IT'S WHERE I FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE IN MY OWN SKIN.
Jimmy: EXACTLY. OF COURSE, YEAH. NOT AT ALL. BUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS. BECAUSE I FOLLOW YOU ON TWITTER, ALL THE TIME. I KEEP UP WITH YOU AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW -- THIS IS YOU HANGING OUT WITH RICHARD SIMMONS. AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW, HOW DOES THIS COME ABOUT? AND WHAT IS THIS? AND IS EVERYTHING OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ]
UM, EVERYTHING IS FINE.
Jimmy: GOOD.
UM, I --
Jimmy: I LOVE RICHARD SIMMONS.
ME TOO. I TOOK AN EXERCISE CLASS WITH HIM. WITH MY FRIEND DANNY FRANZESE. AND IT WAS REALLY INTENSE. AND --
Jimmy: WHAT WAS HE LIKE -- HE WAS YOUR TRAINER?
HE WAS -- HE WAS -- I THINK, YEAH. IT'S A STUDIO CALLED RICHARD SLIMMONS STUDIO? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WAS HE AN IMPERSONATOR?
NO, THAT'S HIM.
Jimmy: DID HE CHANGE HIS NAME TO RICHARD SLIMMONS?
NO, I THINK THAT'S THE NAME OF THE STUDIO. IT WAS A WHILE AGO. BUT IT WAS FUN. HE YELLED AT ME A LOT. HE'S LIKE REALLY AGGRESSIVE.
Jimmy: WHAT?
THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER FROM THAT CLASS IS HE KEPT SCREAMING AT ME -- "COME ON, PRINCESS EYES!" "HARDER, PRINCESS EYES!" AND HE CALLED ME PRINCESS EYES, WHICH WAS LIKE MY NICKNAME.
Jimmy: SO YOU GOT A A NICKNAME? WE MET HIM ONCE. ROOTS, DO YOU REMEMBER WE MET RICHARD SIMMONS? WE WERE DOING THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE AND WE WERE ON THE FLOAT. AND WE WERE ALL JUST WAVING. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS REALLY FUN. AND WE HEARD, "ROOTS, ROOTS, JIMMY." AND WE WERE LOOKING AND WE TURNED AROUND. AND I'M NOT KIDDING. RICHARD SIMMONS WAS ON A A GLITTERY SEAHORSE. [ LAUGHTER ]
WOW.
Jimmy: HE'S ON A GLITTERY SEAHOURSE. AND I'M NOT JOKING. WE ALL LOOKED OVER AND WAVED AT HIM. TARIQ WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO ME, HE TOOK HIS LEG AND PULLED IT BEHIND HIS HEAD AND JUST WAVED AT US. [ LAUGHTER ]
WOW. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: UNBELIEVABLE. I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. IT REALLY HAPPENED. IT REALLY HAPPENED. NOT KIDDING. [ APPLAUSE ]
SOUNDS LIKE A NIGHTMARE.
Jimmy: NO, IT WAS A DREAM COME TRUE.
DREAM COME TRUE, YEAH.
Jimmy: SOMETHING. WE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT IT, BUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] EXCEPT WITH OUR THERAPISTS, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I KNOW YOU STAY REALLY ACTIVE. I WISH I SAW, YOU'RE IN -- A WOMEN'S BASKETBALL LEAGUE?
YES.
Jimmy: WHAT IS THIS? 'CAUSE I WANT TO GO SEE IT. I WANT TO GO SEE YOU PLAY BASKETBALL.
YOU CAN COME SEE IT EVERY TUESDAY NIGHT. I'M ON A TEAM, WE'RE CALLED THE PISTOL SHRIMP.
Jimmy: THE PISTOL SHRIMP.
AND WE PLAY IN THE L.A. WOMEN'S LEAGUE. THAT'S ME RIGHT THERE GIVING THE FINGER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: YEAH. VERY NICE. APPRECIATE THAT.
WE'RE A REALLY SERIOUS BASKETBALL TEAM.
Jimmy: NO, YOU'RE NOT. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, WE ARE. YEAH. ACTUALLY, I HAVE A MESSAGE FROM THE CAPTAIN THAT I WANTED TO READ.
Jimmy: YOU KEEP YOUR iPHONE THERE?
YEAH. THE CAPTAIN OF OUR BASKETBALL TEAM WANTED TO SAY THIS MESSAGE TO ALL OF OUR HATERS. BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE HATERS. AND SHE SAID, "JUST SAY, 'LOOK, JIMMY, WE LOVE TO BALL AND WE BALL HARD. NO HATERS ALLOWED. YOU'RE EITHER WITH US OR AGAINST US AND MAY GOD HELP YOU IF YOU'RE AGAINST US, BECAUSE WE WILL DUNK ON YOUR ASS SO HARD!'"
Jimmy: HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, HEY! PUT THAT BACK IN YOUR CLEAVAGE. WE DON'T LIKE THAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE.
ALL RIGHT.
Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. BUT ARE YOU GOOD?
UM, WE'RE TERRIBLE.
Jimmy: YEAH, ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. WELL -- MAKES SENSE --
WE'RE NOT TERRIBLE. WE'RE NOT GREAT. WE'VE WON A COUPLE GAMES.
Jimmy: OKAY.
AND WE'VE GOTTEN OUR ASS KICKED REAL BAD.
Jimmy: IS IT TRUE THAT ONE TIME YOU PLAYED -- YOU WERE PLAYING IN THE GAME AND YOU JUST ASKED SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER TEAM TO GIVE YOU THE BALL?
UH, THAT IS A TACTIC THAT I -- [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S CALLED PSYCHOLOGICAL BASKETBALL.
Jimmy: NO, IT'S NOT.
YEAH IT IS.
Jimmy: I CAN TELL THAT YOU'RE MAKING IT UP RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T CARE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: DID IT WORK?
YEAH, SHE GAVE IT TO ME. YEAH. THE THING IS, WHAT WAS HAPPENING, IN ALL HONESTY -- WE WERE DOWN BY LIKE MAYBE 50 POINTS.
Jimmy: OH MY GOD!
THE OTHER POINT GUARD, WHO WAS REALLY GOOD, WAS LIKE DRIBBLING, AND THEY HAD THE BALL. AND I WAS DEFENDING HER, AND SHE WAS LIKE DRIBBLING. AND SHE WAS LIKE, "YO, CAN I GET A PICTURE WITH YOU AFTER THE GAME?" AND I WAS LIKE, "IF YOU GIVE ME THE BALL RIGHT NOW. JUST HAND IT TO ME." AND SHE WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT." BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T GIVE A A [ BLEEP ] BECAUSE THEY WERE KICKING OUR ASS.
Jimmy: YEAH.
SO SHE GAVE IT TO ME AND I MADE A LAYUP. AND IT WAS REALLY ANTI-CLIMATIC. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: WE HAVE FOOTAGE OF THE LAYUP THAT WAS HEARD AROUND THE WORLD. HERE IS AUBREY PLAZA MAKING A A LAYUP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jimmy: THAT IS SO YOU! THAT IS SO YOU. YOU THINK YOU'D JUMP UP AND DOWN OR DO SOMETHING. BUT, NO, YOU'RE JUST LIKE "YEAH, WHATEVER."
WE WERE DOWN BY 50 POINTS.
Jimmy: YOU WERE DOWN BY 50. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR MOVIE, "LIFE AFTER BETH." IT'S THE FIRST-EVER ROM-COM-ZOM-DRAM.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S A ROM-COM-ZOM-DRAM.
Jimmy: NOW, EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS.
IT'S A --
Jimmy: ROMANTIC COMEDY.
--ROMANTIC COMEDY ZOMBIE DRAMA.
Jimmy: OKAY. PERFECT. SO FIRST, YOU GET BIT BY A A SNAKE.
YES.
Jimmy: AND YOU START TURNING INTO A ZOMBIE.
YES.
Jimmy: WELL, YOU DIE AND COME BACK AS A ZOMBIE.
YES. I -- YOU DON'T SEE ME GET BIT BY A SNAKE, BUT THE MOVIE STARTS AT MY FUNERAL. AND I'VE DIED, MY CHARACTER. AND THEN I REAPPEAR. AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHY. THERE'S SOMETHING KIND OF OFF ABOUT ME. AND THEN THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE I SLOWLY TRANSFORM INTO A ZOMBIE.
Jimmy: BUT I DO WANT TO SHOW A CLIP OF AUBREY PLAZA IN "LIFE AFTER BETH." TAKE A LOOK.
