Audience Member: I LOVE YOU JIMMY!
Jimmy: I LOVE YOU, TOO. I LOVE YOU. [ CHEERS ] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. LET'S GET TO THE TO STORIES HERE. HERE'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS PRETTY CRAZY. A WOMAN IN LAS VEGAS WAS ARRESTED YESTERDAY AFTER SHE THREW A SHOE AT HILLARY CLINTON -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]  --WHILE HILLARY WAS GIVING A A SPEECH. YEAH, THE WOMAN WAS TACKLED, CUFFED, AND THROWN INTO A A POLICE CAR. THEN THE COPS SAID, "NORMALLY WE DO THAT, HILLARY. BUT THANK YOU FOR THE HELP." [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S VERY TOUGH. I GUESS THE WOMAN RAN SHE SAW HILLARY STARTED TAKING OFF HER EARRINGS. "OH YOU WANT TO MESS WITH ME? ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M TAKING OFF MY HEELS NOW. THIS IS SERIOUS." ANOTHER BIG STORY. AFTER HANDLING THE BUMPY ROLL-OUT OF THE OBAMACARE WEBSITE, KATHLEEN SEBELIUS ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT SHE IS RESIGNING. [ AUDIENCE AWS ] WHICH EXPLAINS WHY BEING THROWN UNDER A BUS IS NOW COVERED BY OBAMACARE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH, IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE OBAMACARE WEBSITE HAD SOME PROBLEMS. BUT I THINK YOU CAN TELL ALL THOSE GLITCHES AND MISTAKES ARE BEHIND SEBELIUS. NO MISTAKES. NO MORE GLITCHES FOR HER. I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT HER AT HER SPEECH.
FINALLY FEELING SECURE AND KNOWING THEY CAN TAKE CARE THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. [ LAUGHTER ] UNFORTUNATELY, A PAGE IS MISSING. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I'M JUST GRATEFUL --
Jimmy: OH NO, NO. OH, MY GOODNESS. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] HOW DO YOU BOTCH YOUR FAREWELL SPEECH? [ LAUGHTER ] TAKE THIS JOB AND -- [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] WELL, I WANT TO THANK THE FAMILIES FOR -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND GET THIS, THE WHITE HOUSE JUST RELEASED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TAX RETURNS. WHICH SHOWED THAT HE AND MICHELLE PAID $98,000 IN TAXES LAST YEAR. WHEN HE SAW THAT, EVEN OBAMA WAS LIKE, "THANKS, OBAMA." [ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ] BUT YOU'RE OBAMA. OH. NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MAD ABOUT THIS. THIS WEEK, THE SENATE BLOCKED A A NEW BILL CALLED THE PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT. OKAY, AND THAT WOULD NARROW THE PAY GAP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN. THEY BLOCKED IT. [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ] NO, THEY BLOCKED IT. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY SAID BAD IDEA. THEY DON'T WANT TO NARROW THE PAY GAP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN. NOT CLAPPING. IT'S NOT A GOOD THING.
Steve: YAY.
Jimmy: MEN SHOULD MAKE MORE THAN WOMEN! BUT TO ILLUSTRATE HOW BIG A A PROBLEM THIS, LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT SOME MALE REPUBLICAN SENATORS MAKE. AND WHAT THEIR FEMALE DOPPLEGANGERS MIGHT MAKE. FIRST HERE'S ARIZONA SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. HE MAKES $174,000 A YEAR. LET'S SEE WHAT HE MADE IF WE WERE A WOMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] $87,000. THAT'S HALF HIS CURRENT SALARY. WHO'S THIS? HOUSE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL. IN 2014 HIS SALARY IS A A $193,400. BUT IF HE WERE A WOMAN -- $90,000 DOLLARS. [ LAUGHTER ] PRETTY STEEP DROP OFF. THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF. AND FINALLY, HERE'S SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM. THIS YEAR HE'LL MAKE $174,000. IF HE WERE A WOMAN -- [ LAUGHTER ] $174,000. [ APPLAUSE ] HOW IS THAT --
Steve: THAT'S NOT --
Jimmy: HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
Steve: OH, NO YOU DID NOT.
Jimmy: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE. THOSE ARE JUST GUESSTIMATES. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. AND OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY HAS AN OPINION ABOUT IT. SO WE SENT OUR WRITER, ARTHUR DOWN TO THE STREETS HERE IN NEW YORK AND HEAR WHAT THE PEOPLE THINK. THE ONLY CATCH WAS, THEY HAD TO DANCE THE ENTIRE TIME THEY ANSWERED THE QUESTION. [ LAUGHTER ] WE CALL IT "QUESTIONS AND DANSWERS." TAKE A LOOK. ♪♪ ♪ QUESTIONS AND DANSWERS YEAH ♪
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF CONGRESS VETO VOTING AGAINST EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN?
I THINK IF A WOMAN CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT A MAN CAN DO, THAT SHE SHOULD BE PAID THE SAME MONEY AS HE.
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S REALLY UNFAIR AS WOMEN ARE PAID ON THE ABOUT 70 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR COMPARED TO MEN. AND LIKE THAT -- [ LAUGHTER ]  --SHOULDN'T BE A THING BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY SUCH AND SUCH AMOUNT OF WORK.
I THINK IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF PAY AS THE MEN DO. AND WHY WOULDN'T THEY? THEY WORK JUST AS HARD IF NOT -- -- HARDER. [ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK THAT'S ATROCIOUS. WOMEN CAN DO EVERYTHING MEN CAN DO. WE SHOULD BE PAID THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY.
IF THEY ARE DOING SAME JOB -- [ LAUGHTER ]  --THEN THEY SHOULD BE PAID THE SAME AMOUNT. MAKES SENSE TO ME. AND I THINK MY WIFE WOULD AGREE. [ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK IT'S WRONG AND I THINK WOMEN SHOULD BE PAID EXACTLY THE SAME AS MEN. [ LAUGHTER ] EXACTLY THE SAME!
Jimmy: EXACTLY THE SAME! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EXACTLY THE SAME. ♪♪ I LOVE NEW YORKERS. THAT WAS SO FUN. THIS IS KIND OF SCARY HERE. A COUPLE IN INDIANA IS DOING FINE AFTER THEIR HOT AIR BALLOON CRASHED RIGHT AFTER THE GUY PROPOSED. YEP. THEY SAID THE INCIDENT SHOWED THAT THEIR LOVE CAN WITHSTAND ANY OBSTACLE. WHILE GOD SAID IT SHOWS THEY'RE TERRIBLE AT TAKING A HINT. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THIS NEW ONLINE VIDEO GAME ABOUT ROB FORD? IT'S A REAL THING. IT'S A REAL GAME.

[ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS ] UNFORTUNATELY, NOBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO BEAT THE HIGH SCORE SET BY ROB FORD IN REAL LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD LUCK TO EVERYBODY. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU CAN TRY, NOT GOING TO WIN. SOME BIG TECH NEWS. NEXT WEEK, GOOGLE WILL GIVE THE PUBLIC THE CHANCE TO BUY ITS $1,500 GOOGLE GLASS. YEAH. FINALLY ENDING THE STEREOTYPE THAT PEOPLE WHO WEAR GLASSES ARE SMART. [ LAUGHTER ] "PAID 1500 BUCKS FOR THESE SUCKERS. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW'S IT'S GOING MAN? AW, I HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME AT YOUR WEDDING. IT WAS SO GOOD." [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS A NICE STORY HERE. A FAMILY IN CALIFORNIA WAS JUST REUNITED WITH ITS DOG, SEVEN YEARS AFTER IT WENT MISSING. IT GOT WEIRD WHEN THE DOG WAS LIKE, "YEAH I'M JUST HERE TO GET MY CDs." [ LAUGHTER ] "THAT'S MY PEARL JAM CD." [ LAUGHTER ] AND FINALLY, I SAW THAT ESPN JUST STARTED AIRING CRICKET. I KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT CRICKET. IT'S NOT A BIG SPORT HERE IN THE U.S. BUT I GUESS THEY REALLY WANT AMERICANS TO WATCH. THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT SEEM EXCITING. YOU CAN TELL BY THEIR NEW PROMO. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PROMO.

Jimmy: DID YOU MEET THEM?
OH, I DIDN'T GET TO MEET THEM YET. I MET GENE A COUPLE OF TIMES. VERY NICE MAN, BUT --
Jimmy: WITH MAKEUP OR NO MAKE UP?
NOT WITH MAKEUP, BUT -- YEAH, I REMEMBER KISS. I WAS 10 YEARS OLD. I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND MY BEST FRIEND, TONY DARREN, WAS A HUGE KISS FAN. WE WERE IN MUSIC CLASS TOGETHER. AND HE SAID, "I'M GOING TO GET UP AND DO SOMETHING." HE GOT UP IN FRONT OF THE CLASS AND HE ASKED OUR MUSIC TEACHER TO PLAY "STRUTTER" VERY LOUDLY. WE'RE BOTH TEN. HE TURNED HIS BACK TO ALL THE STUDENTS. HE FILLED HIS MOUTH WITH ARTIFICIAL BLOOD AND HE SPUN BACK AROUND AGAIN. HE STARTED SPITTING BLOOD ALL OVER THE CLASSROOM FLOOR. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL OVER THE STUDENT'S TEXT BOOKS. HIS TONGUE WAS STICKING OUT LIKE A COBRA. [ LAUGHTER ] THE KIDS WERE SCARED. THE TEACHER WAS NOT AMUSED.
Jimmy: NO! DID NOT ENJOY THAT. SHOCKING.

Jimmy: YEAH. I REALLY LOVED THE TURNING AROUND AND SPITTING BLOOD, SPEWING ON EVERYBODY. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THEM IN CONCERT?
SADLY, NO. AND I WANT TO. AND I'M SURE ONE DAY I WILL. BUT REALLY, GENE IS A VERY NICE GENTLEMAN. I MET HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES. LOVELY.
Jimmy: NICEST GUYS EVER, BUT THEY LOOK LIKE MONSTERS.
I AM ONE OF THOSE GUYS -- I AM ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT REALLY WISHED THEY NEVER EVER TOOK THE MAKEUP OFF. I MEAN, I LOVE THEM ON "MTV UNPLUGGED" WITHOUT THE MAKEUP. BUT I JUST WISH WE NEVER KNEW WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE. WE'D BE SITTING HERE TODAY AND IT WAS A MYSTERY. I JUST THINK THAT WOULD BE SO COOL.
Jimmy: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I KIND OF LIKE SEEING THEM.
YOU DO?
Jimmy: I GO THE OTHER WAY.
OKAY.
Jimmy: BECAUSE WHAT IF THEY ARE NOT KISS, AND THEY'VE BEEN LYING TO US THE WHOLE TIME?
AH. [ LAUGHTER ]
SORT OF LIKE AN ANDY KAUFMANN/CHARLIE CLIFTON THING.
Jimmy: YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. YEAH, YEAH. SO THE GENE SIMMONS YOU MADE IS NOT THE GENE SIMMONS FROM KISS.
THAT'S ALSO INTERESTING. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT ONE.
Jimmy: I DON'T THINK IT'S TRUE, BUT YEAH. I LIKE TO GIVE YOU SOME MIND-BENDERS. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE AN ADVENTUROUS GUY. LAST TIME WE TALKED MOTORCYCLES BECAUSE I WAS THINKING ABOUT JOINING A GANG. [ LAUGHTER ]

I MET KELLY SLATER RECENTLY AND WE TALKED ABOUT MATT SURFING MAVERICKS. AND HE SAID, "SKATERS ALWAYS GET BANGED UP, BUT THEY DON'T DIE. BUT, SURFERS, THEY NEVER GET BANGED UP, BUT THEY CAN DIE. SO IT'S LIKE A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL OF EXTREME SPORTS. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SURF ONE DAY, FOR SURE.
Jimmy: NEVER SURFED BEFORE.
YOU HAVEN'T? I DID SURF ONCE OUT AT SUNSET BEACH IN CALIFORNIA, AND IT WAS A NIGHTMARE. I WAS, IT'S CALLED "TOMBSTONING," WHERE YOU'RE -- ALL THAT'S ABOVE THE WATER IS A A LITTLE TRIANGLE OF THE TOP OF YOUR BOARD. AND I WAS -- THE CURRENT WAS PULLING ME AWAY FROM MY BOARD.

YOU DON'T REALLY -- YOU'RE GENTLE WITH IT. BUT THE PROBLEM IS, THE SNAKE COULD HAVE SPAT VENOM IN TYE'S FACE, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A A DISASTER. SO I HAD TO CAREFULLY, DIRECT HIS HEAD THAT WAY SO I COULD SHOW THE FANGS AND NOT HAVE --
Jimmy: THOSE ARE CRAZY FANGS.

I DIDN'T WANT TO MILK THE VENOM OUT. I WANTED TO HAVE THE ADRENALINE AND THE STUNT ASPECT OF IT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I SORT OF GENTLY TOSSED IT INTO THE GRASS. BECAUSE I LIKED THE SNAKE, TOO.

Jimmy: YEAH, BUT YOU'RE MOM, YOU SEEM TO REALLY -- NOTHING GOES WRONG.
I ADORE MY MOM. I'M SO LUCKY.
Jimmy: I LOVE MY MOM TOO, BUT, BOY, SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, CAN'T GET OFF THE PHONE -- LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME.
Jimmy: YEAH, CAN'T GET OFF THE PHONE. SHE CALLS, I JUST PUT THE PHONE DOWN. I GO DO STUFF. I COME BACK SHE'S STILL TALKING. SHE'S TELLING ME WHO'S ON "ELLEN." SHE'S LIKE, "I'M WATCHING "'ELLEN.'"
YEAH, THANKS MOM.
Jimmy: YEAH, THANKS. MY MOM JUST HAD KNEE SURGERY. SO SHE'S WATCHING THE SHOW RIGHT NOW. SO GET BETTER MOM.

Jimmy: SHE'S DOING GOOD. IT ALL WENT GREAT.

Jimmy: BUT SHE'S OVER AT MY HOUSE AND SHE WANTS TO SEE THE BABY. I HAVE THE BABY. SHE'S JUST HANGING OUT WITH THE BABY. AND SHE GOES TO BED.
CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT AS WELL.
Jimmy: THANK YOU. SHE HAS BAD KNEES. BECAUSE SHE'S GOING TO GET SURGERY, SO THEREFORE -- YEAH. SO MY DOG GARY COMES IN THE ROOM AND STARTS TO JUMP UP. AND MY MOM GOES LIKE -- [ WEIRD NOISE ] AND I GO, "WILL YOU SIT DOWN?" AND SHE'S LIKE -- [ WEIRD NOISE ] AND I GO -- LIKE A COMIC. LIKE A CARTOON. AND I GO, "WILL YOU SIT DOWN?" LIKE ON HER WOBBLY -- HER KNEES ARE BAD. I GO -- I DON'T WANT TO GET HER KNOCKED DOWN. AND I GO, "MOM, PLEASE SIT DOWN." AND SHE GOES, "DON'T YOU GRAB ME." [ LAUGHTER ]
I LOVE THAT. I LOVE THAT. THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE YOUR MOM. YOU CAN'T TELL THEM WHAT TO DO.
Jimmy: UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU CANNOT TELL MOMS WHAT TO DO.
Jimmy: YOU CAN'T TELL MOMS WHAT TO DO. BUT YOU HAVE A NEW NIECE AND NEPHEW.
I DO.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
ALL IN THE PAST YEAR. THANK YOU. YES.
Jimmy: ARE YOU GOING TO SEE THEM ALL THIS WEEKEND?
NO MY OLDEST SISTER LIVES IN JAPAN. SO I'M GOING TO SEE MY LITTLE NIECE IVY SOMETIME THIS SUMMER. BUT I'M GOING TO SEE EMMITT AND MY OTHER SISTER'S BABY BOY -- I'M GOING TO SEE HIM TOMORROW.
Jimmy: HERE'S A PICTURE OF YOU. THIS IS YOU AND IVY.
NO, THAT'S EMMITT.
Jimmy: OH, THAT'S EMMITT?
YEAH, THAT'S EMMITT. HE'S SO CUTE. THAT IS LIKE A WEEK OLD.
Jimmy: TINY LITTLE BABY.
MAN, IT'S CRAZY, ISN'T IT? WHEN YOU HAVE NIECES -- I MEAN, NOW YOU HAVE A BABY. SO, I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE -- THE WAY THAT I FEEL ABOUT THESE CHILDREN, WHEN I HAVE MY OWN, I'M GOING TO PERMANENTLY CRY. THEY MAKE ME SO HAPPY.
Jimmy: YEAH. YOU CRY ABOUT EVERYTHING. YEAH, YEAH.
I'M ON SKYPE WITH IVY OR WITH EMMITT. I'M LIKE, UGH! IT'S -- I CAN'T KEEP IT TOGETHER. SO IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING WHEN I BECOME A MOM.
Jimmy: YOU'RE SO LUCKY TO HAVE SKYPE. MY MOM DOESN'T UNDERSTAND SKYPE. [ LIGHT LAUGHTER ] I SKYPE MY MOM AND IT'S LIKE UP -- HER NOSE IS LIKE IN THE SCREEN. SHE'S LIKE, "I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. I CAN HEAR HIM. I CAN'T SEE HIM. DON'T YOU GRAB ME!" [ LAUGHTER ]
MY PARENTS HAVE JUST FIGURED OUT FACETIME. AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE BLESSING. I MEAN, THEY NEVER FIGURED IT OUT UNTIL THERE WERE GRANDCHILDREN. AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY'RE LIKE, "OH NO, NO, YEAH. I KNOW HOW TO WORK THIS."
Jimmy: HOW COOL IS THAT?
AMAZING.
Jimmy: AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING WHERE YOU GUYS SEND EACH OTHER VIDEOS, LIKE A A DROPBOX WHERE THE FAMILY SENDS FUN --
WE HAVE LIKE A FAMILY TEXT FEED, YOU KNOW? SO ALL MY SISTER AND PARENTS ARE ON THIS TEXT MESSAGE FEED. AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, WE'RE LIKE, SAYING -- SENDING PICTURES LIKE, "HEY, THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING TODAY. THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING TODAY." AND MY LITTLE SISTER IS LIKE, "HEY, I'M STUDYING. LOOK AT ME STUDYING." AND MY OTHER SISTER IS LIKE, "LOOK AT MANY BABY BUMP." AND THE OTHER ONE IS LIKE, "HEY, LOOK AT MY -- LOOK AT MY BABY. SHE'S SO CUTE." AND I'M LIKE -- THIS ONE TIME I SENT THIS VIDEO OF ME. THIS IS WHAT I WAS DOING THAT MORNING. I WAS GETTING MY HEAD DUNKED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. GETTING TORTURED ON THIS SHOW. AND SOMEONE TOOK A VIDEO OF IT. AND I WAS LIKE, "HEY, LOOK WHAT I'M DOING." [ LAUGHTER ] NOTHING. FOR LIKE TWO HOURS.
Jimmy: YOU DON'T SEND A A TORTURE VIDEO TO YOUR FAMILY! [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S A VIDEO. WATCH THIS VIDEO. TELL ME IF YOU'RE SCARED BY THIS. [ COUGHING ] [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
I DON'T KNOW.
I ALMOST THREW UP.
I'M LIKE, YEP. YEP, GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jimmy: CHRIS, YEAH, YOU GOT THAT TAKE? NO, YOU DON'T SEND THAT!
I KNOW! AND THEN, FINALLY, MY SISTER TEXTS BACK, "AAHH!" AND THEN MY MOM IS LIKE, "DON'T SEND US VIDEOS." THEY'RE GOING TO DELETE ME FROM OUR GROUP FEED. SO I GOT TO BE CAREFUL NOW.
Jimmy: CONGRATULATIONS ON THE "CAPTAIN AMERICA." BOY, OH, BOY. IT COULDN'T BE A BIGGER -- YOU'RE IN THE BIGGEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.

Jimmy: YEAH, THEY'RE FUN. AGENT 13.
AND TO BE A PART OF IT IS SO COOL. I WAS FREAKING OUT THE WHOLE TIME.
Jimmy: YOU HAVE A COOL CHARACTER TOO.
SHE'S VERY COOL. AND WE JUST, SORT OF, INTRODUCED HER IN THIS FILM. CAPTAIN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHO SHE IS YET, THAT HER RELATION WITH PEGGY CARTER AND ALL THAT. SO IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE THEY GO WITH IT BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, IN THE COMIC BOOKS THEY HAD A VERY COMPLICATED LOVE AFFAIR. YEAH, IT WAS JUST SO MUCH FUN.
Jimmy: WHEN YOU DO THE FILM, DO YOU ALMOST SLIP A COUPLE TIMES AND CALL HIM CAP'N? CAP'N AMERICA?
CAP'N?
Jimmy: LIKE CAP'N CRUNCH? [ LAUGHTER ]
NOPE. NOPE.
Jimmy: THEY SHOULD MAKE A A MOVIE ABOUT CAP'N CRUNCH. [ LAUGHTER ] I'D STAR IN IT.
IS IT BAD THAT I CALLED HIM CAPTAIN CRUNCH?
Jimmy: IT GOES CAP'N AMERICA. LESS CHARACTERS ON TWITTER. I MEAN, YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
I MEAN, IT'S EASY, YEAH. WHY NOT?
