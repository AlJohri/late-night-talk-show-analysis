WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NOW, AS WE SAW EARLIER, THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF IN-FIGHTING NOW BETWEEN REPUBLICAN  CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT. GETTING A LITTLE UGLY BUT THERE IS STILL ONE AREA WHERE THEY'RE OF A SINGLE MIND.
WE DON'T PUT PEOPLE IN CLASSES.
THE CLASS WARFARE ARGUMENT IS A BARACK OBAMA IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE PART OF THE  REPUBLICAN LEXICON.
HE CONTINUALLY WANTS TO PRACTICE CLASS WARFARE AND PUNISH SUCCESS.
CLASS WARFARE TO ATTACK ATTACK THE PEOPLE WHO CREATE JOBS.
THAT'S THEIR JOB, DIVIDE, SEPARATE, PUT ONE GROUP AGAINST ANOTHER.
Jon: REPUBLICANS UNITE PEOPLE. NOT LIKE THOSE UNAMERICAN LIBERAL DEMOCRATS. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THE POLITICS OF CLASS RESENTMENT. I SEE WE HAVE A LITERACY CROWD HERE TONIGHT. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THE POLITICS OF RESENTMENT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE HAS NO PLACE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY? RICH GUYS LIKE MITT ROMNEY.
I DON'T THINK A LIBERAL MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR IS GOING TO COME AND BE ABLE TO  GO AND RELATE TO FOLKS AS WELL AS A GUY WHO GREW UP AS A GRANDSON OF A COAL MINER.
I'LL BET YOU $10,000, HOLY MACKERAL. I MEAN THAT'S JUST A LOT OF MONEY FOR MOST PEOPLE. I GUESS NOT FOR MITT.
I CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF MONEY HE HAS.
GOVERNOR ROMNEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE BACK ALL THE MONEY HE'S EARNED FROM BANKRUPTING  COMPANIES AND LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES OVER HIS YEARS, THAT I WOULD THEN BE GLAD TO LISTEN TO HIM.
Jon: HMMM. YOU BELIEVE MITT ROMNEY SHOULD GIVE BACK WHAT YOU FEEL ARE ILL GOTTEN GAINS AND PERHAPS  REDISTRIBUTE THEM. WELCOME, COMRADE. BORST IS ON THE TABLE. DID I PRONOUNCE THAT RIGHT? WAIT. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH HAVING UNFETTERED WEALTH?
I WAS JUST STRUCK BY THE POLITICO ANALYSIS OF THE SHEER VOLUME OF ANTI-GINGRICH ADS  RUN BY ROMNEY'S PAC.
IF HIS PAC SAYS THINGS ARE FALSE THAT'S HOW WASHINGTON PLAYS THE GAME ISN'T THAT  EXACTLY WHAT IS SICK ABOUT THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW? ISN'T THAT WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF?
Jon: OH, IT'S NOT FAIR. HE'S USING UNLIMITED MONEY TO BUY INFLUENCE, RIGGING THE SYSTEM IN SOME WAY. INTERESTING. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW FRUSTRATED AND HELPLESS NEWT GINGRICH MUST FEEL. HEY, HOW DO GUYS LIKE MITT ROMNEY COME TO BE ANYWAY?
BELIEVING IN THE BOTTOM UP, BELIEVING IN FREE PEOPLE AND FREE MARKETS.
PULL BACK THE REGULATION THAT ARE STRANGLING THE AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
WE HAVE TO LOWER TAX RATES CONSIDERABLY ON JOB CREATOR.
GET GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY.
LOWER TAXES, LESS REGULATION. AND THE PEOPLE WHO CREATE JOBS.
Jon: YOUR PLATFORM. UNMITIGATED CORPORATE MONEY IN POLITICS. HANDSOMENESS, DISTINGUISHED GRAY TEMPLES.
I STARTED MY OWN BUSINESS. I'VE LEARNED FROM THAT. I LEARNED THE LESSONS OF A FREE ECONOMY OVER 25 YEARS. CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, MY FRIEND.
Jon: YOU'RE MAD AT MITT ROMNEY? FOR GOD'S SAKES IT'S LIKE MITT ROMNEY ANSWER THE REPUBLICANS'  E-HARMONY AD AND NOW YOU'RE SAYING IT'S UNFAIR. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU MEANT. YOU DON'T MEAN IT THAT MUCH. MITT ROMNEY IS THE PURE DISSTILLATION OF CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES. NOW THAT YOU HAVE TO GO UP AGAINST HIM NOW IT'S UNFAIR. REPUBLICANS, YOU CAN'T SAY RELEASE THE KRACKEN AND THEN WHEN IT TURNS ON YOU, BE LIKE  THIS IS A VERY SCARY KRACKEN. I DIDN'T REALIZE THE FEROCIOUSNESS. DO WE HAVE A CRACK IN THE POCKET, A CRACK... PERHAPS THE CRACK-ETTES BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T MY FRIENDS AND I WILL HAVE TO TAKE TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST. WE ARE THE 99%. OF THE 1%. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
