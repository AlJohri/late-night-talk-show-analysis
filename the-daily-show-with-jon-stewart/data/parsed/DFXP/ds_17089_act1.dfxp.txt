Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! BOOM, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD ONE TONIGHT. OH, MY GUEST, JULIA LOUISE DREYFUS WILL BE JOINING US FROM HER BRAND NEW VIE "V.P." BUT  WE'RE GOING TO START WITH OUR BRAND NEW SEGMENT ON THE SHOW CALLED HEY, THAT GUY LIVE THERE IS! (LAUGHTER) YOU'LL UNDERSTAND IT IN A SECOND. YESTERDAY PROFESSIONAL ADD ADVENTURER AND PART TIME SNIDELY WHIPLASH IMPERSONATOR GERALDO  RIVERA WAS IN AFGHANISTAN COVERING THE TALIBAN'S RECENTLY RELAUNCHED SPRING OFFENSIVE  WHERE HE SCORED AN EXCLUSIVE PHONE INTERVIEW WITH A TALIBAN SPOKESPERSON.
ALL RIGHT. OUR DEAR FRIEND, LONG TIME AFGHAN PRODUCER, HE HAS THE TALIBAN SPOKESMAN ON THE LINE. ASK HOW HE FEELS ABOUT GETTING HIS ASS KICKED. (AUDIENCE REACTS) (LAUGHTER)
OKAY, TWO THINGS, ONE, I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD THE CELL PHONE RECEPTION IS IN AFGHANISTAN. HOW MANY BARS DO YOU THINK THAT GUY'S PULLING. NUMBER TWO-- AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY-- GERALDO, THAT GUY LIVE THERE IS! (LAUGHTER) MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T ANNOUNCE HIS NAME AND SHOW HIS FACE WHILE  MAKING HIM TAUNT THE TALIBAN FOR YOU.
THAT'S GREAT POWER. YOU GOT 17 DUDES KILLED WHAT DO YOU ACCOMPLISH?
ALL RIGHT, HE'S MAKING A SPEECH. HE'S MAKING A SPEECH, IT'S PROPAGANDA. WHAT DID HE WIN? WHAT DID YOU WIN? JERKOFF, WHAT DID YOU WIN? (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON LOCAL CUSTOMS IN AFGHANISTAN BUT I DO THINK TO  RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS "JERKOFF" IS CONSIDERED AN INSULT. (LAUGHTER) MY HOPE IS AKBAR HERE HAS SPENT ENOUGH TIME WITH GERALDO TO BE LOOSE WITH HIS PASHTOï¿½r TRANSLATION.
ASK HOW HE FEELS ABOUT GETTING HIS ASS KICKED.
THE MAN FROM THE CAR OWE CART GAME WOULD LIKE TO INQUIRE HOW YOU ARE FEELING THIS FINE MORNING. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: GERALDO, WHEN YOU RETURN HOME TO THE STATES YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM YOUR  NEIGHBORS ALTHOUGH YOUR FRIEND AKBAR LIVES IN AFGHANISTAN SURROUNDED BY THOSE JERKOFFS. (APPLAUSE) BECAUSE, TO REITERATE, HEY! THAT GUY LIVES THERE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S TAX DAY. SO JUST AS AMERICANS ARE WRITING THEIR CHECKS TO THE I.R.S., SENATE DEMOCRATS HAVE DECIDED TO BRING TO A VOTE THE BUFFETT RULE THAT ENSURINGS PEOPLE EARNING  OVER A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR PAY AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 30% INCLUDING INVESTMENT INCOME AS  OPPOSED TO THE JIMMY BUFFETT RULE WHICH IS WHICH ASSURES THAT... WHAT'S THAT? OH, EVERYBODY'S DONE THAT JOKE ALREADY? ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) HOW ABOUT THE BUFFET RULE THAT SAYS YOU SHOULD USE THE TONGS FOR... (LAUGHTER). I'M JUST BEING STUPID. I UNDERSTAND. TO THE SENATE FLOOR.
THE BUFFETT TAX WOULD RAISE A MERE PITTANCE IN THE SCOPE OF FEDERAL BUDGETS.
IT WOULD COVER ABOUT TWO DAY'S WORTH OF THE DEFICITS.
IT WOULD RAISE ABOUT HALF OF ONE DAY'S WORTH OF FEDERAL SPENDING.
Jon: THAT WOULDN'T PAY FOR A HALF DAY'S WORK ON THE SECRET  REANIMATE RONALD REAGAN PROJECT... OOPS. (LAUGHTER) ZOMBIE REAGAN. BUT POINT TAKEN SENATOR THUNE. THE BUFFETT RULE WOULD ONLY RAISE... (LAUGHTER). THE BUFFETT WOULD ONLY RAISE... REALLY? (LAUGHTER) MY JIMMY BUFFETT JOKE NOTHING, THE BUFFETT CAPER JOKE... (APPLAUSE). ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. SENATOR THUNE IS POINTING OUT THE BUFFETT RULE WOULD ONLY RAISE $47 BILLION OVER THE NEXT  TEN YEARS. I MEAN, THAT'S BARELY... (LAUGHTER). 18.79... WHY DIDN'T I EVER LEARN TO DIVIDE BY 10? (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, POINT IS, $4.7 BILLION PER YEAR ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE.
THE BROADER DEBATE ABOUT FUNDING FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD  IS NOT JUST IDEOLOGICAL, IT'S A FUNDING ISSUE. OVER $300 MILLION A YEAR IN TAXPAYER FUNDS.
$363 MILLION A YEAR TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THAT'S A LOT! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, THERE'S SOME NEW MATH FOR YOU. SO LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET THIS STRAIGHT. $47 BILLION IN MILLIONAIRE'S MONEY IS LESS THAN $300 MILLION DOLLARS IN MAMMOGRAMS AND BIRTH CONTROL. IS THAT WHAT IT IS? (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) TO NO ONE'S SURPRISE, THE REPUBLICANS SUCCESSFULLY FILIBUSTER IT HAD BUFFETT RULE  USING 45 VOTES TO BLOCK IT FROM COMING TO THE FLOOR FOR A DEBATE. EVEN IF THEY HAD PASSED IT REPUBLICANS KNEW IT WOULDN'T MATTER ANYWAY.
THE WEALTHY HAVE AN ARMY OF LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS WHO CAN HELP THEM WORK AROUND THIS  SO-CALLED BUFFETT TAX.
Jon: YOU KNOW, I DON'T GIVE THE REPUBLICANS ENOUGH CREDIT FOR BEING DEEP. THAT'S SOME NO EXIT (BLEEP). "THEY JUST WORK AROUND IT ANYWAY, WHAT'S THE POINT, WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE. WE COULD PASS THE PW *UFLT RULE BUT IT'S LIKE BECKETT SAID IN WAITING FOR GOD DOE, WE GIVE  BIRTH ASTRIDE THE GRAVE." (LAUGHTER) SENATOR WORM FOOD FROM THE GREAT  STATE OF DEPRESSION YIELD IT IS REMAINDER OF HIS FUTILE AND MEANINGLESS TIME. IS THAT REALLY VIEW FROM WOULD IT NOT MATTER IF WE PASSED THE BUFFETT RULE BECAUSE RICH PEOPLE  WOULD JUST GET AROUND IT ANYWAY. WHERE'S DERANGED MILLIONAIRE JOHN HODGEMAN WHEN WE NEED HIM? OH, HEY, HODGEMAN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JOHN, YOU SEEM TO HAVE CAUGHT ME IN MY STATIONARY HOVER BLIMP. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
Jon: JOHN, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF WE PASSED THE BUFFETT RULE ON INCOMES OVER A MILLION DOLLARS?
I'D MAX OUT MY EARNINGS AT $999,99 FROM INVESTMENTS THEN  SHIFT OTHER REVENUE STREAMS INTO A TRUST. WHY? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SO WE WOULD RAISE THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX.
THEN I'LL DIVERT MY INVESTMENT INCOME TO THE CAYMAN ISLANDS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I'LL PENALIZE OFFSHORE ASSETS.
WELL THEN I'LL DIVERT MY ASSETS BACK TO THE UNITED STATES AND PUT THEM INTO A MEDIA COMPANY. VIACOM SOUNDS GOOD. (LAUGHTER) I'LL USE MY CONTROLLING INTEREST TO MAKE SOME PERSONNEL CHANGES  ON THEIR MTV NETWORK PROPERTY COMEDY CENTRAL. (LAUGHTER) THEN I WILL BLIMP CRUSH YOUR HOME.
Jon: WHAT?
AND THEN I'LL HAVE YOU MURDERED.
Jon: WHAT?
WHAT? BLUB, BLUB, BLUB,KY CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER MY STATIONARY BLIMP.
Jon: HODGEMAN, THAT'S ILLEGAL.
JON, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WASHINGTON DEMOCRAT THROWS AT  US, WE'LL SWAT IT AWAY. WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS I'LL DIVERT IT TO WHAT WE RICH PEOPLE CALL THE LAST REFUGE OF SCOUNDRELS, CHARITY. (LAUGHTER) I'D REROUTE MY MILLIONS THROUGH MY NATIONWIDE MET WORK OF ANIMAL SHELTERS.
Jon: AT LEAST THERE IT DOES SOME GOOD.
Jon: YES, GOOD. FOR ME. SEE I CONVERT MY TAXABLE INCOME INTO GOLD THEN GRIND IT UP INTO FLAKES AND PUT THEM IN THE  SUSPENSION OF PURE CINNAMON THIS NAPS WHICH I THEN FEED TO RETIRED GREYHOUNDS.
Jon: YOU'RE GIVING GREYHOUNDS GOLDSCHLAGER?
WELL, THEY'RE RETIRED. THEY DON'T NEED TO BE IN RACING SHAPE ANYMORE.
Jon: SO IT'S NOT SHELTERS FOR ANIMALS.
NO, NO, THE ANIMALS ARE THE SHELTERS. (LAUGHTER) FOR MY INCOME. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: HOW DO YOU GET THE INCOME BACK... OH.
THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S WHAT WE IN THE BUSINESS CALL "GROSS PROFIT." (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: IT'S NASTY.
IT'S THE REVERSE OF WHAT WE CALL MONEY LAUNDERING. >>LAUNDERING.
Jon: I THINK WE GET IT.
