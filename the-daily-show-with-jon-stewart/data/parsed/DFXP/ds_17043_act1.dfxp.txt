JANUARY 12th, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, ONE OF MY FAVORITES, DOLLY PARTON IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. SHE IS A FIRECRACKER. I JUST LOVE HER TO DEATH. WE'RE SO GLAD SHE IS HERE TO JOIN US TONIGHT. BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT WE WANT TO BEGIN WITH THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY RACE AND  THE TALE OF ONE NEWTON LEROY GINGRICH, WHO JUST LAST MONTH HAD READ THE ELECTORAL  TEA LEAVES AND WAS READY TO CALL THE PRIMARY FOR ONE NEWTON LEROY GINGRICH.
IT'S VERY HARD NOT TO LOOK AT THE RECENT POLLS AND THINK THAT THE ODDS ARE VERY  HIGH I'M GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE.
Jon: YEAH. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IT'S GETTING EASIER. (LAUGHTER) YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE POLLS. THEY ARE UNFORTUNATELY FOLLOWED BY THE VOTING. THE TWO DON'T REALLY MATCH UP EXACTLY.
NEWT GINGRICH CAME IN FOURTH IN IOWA.
NEWT GINGRICH FINISHED FOURTH LAST NIGHT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
Jon: SAY HELLO TO THE NEW PRESIDENT OF FOURTHLANDIA, NEWT GINGRICH. LISTEN, NEWTON LEROY GINGRICH ISN'T GOING LET STION LIKE NOBODY VOTING FOR  HIM STOP HIM FROM BECOMING THE NOMINEE. HE'S PLAYING A LONG GAME. THE NEXT STOP IS SOUTH CAROLINA, A STATE WHOSE POPULATION IS FAR MORE DIVERSE THAN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. NEWT DECIDED TO MAKE A BOLD PLAY TO EXPAND HIS BASE.
OBAMA IS THE BEST FOOD STAMP PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. I WOULD LIKE TO BE THE BEST PAYCHECK PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. I'M PREPARED IF THE NAACP INVITES ME, I WILL GO TO THEIR CONVENTION AND TALK ABOUT WHY THE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY SHOULD DEMAND PAYCHECKS AND NOT BE SATISFIED WITH FOOD STAMPS.
Jon: AND THEN I WILL STAND THERE AS THE APPLAUSE WASHES OVER ME--  (LAUGHTER)  AND GLADLY ACCEPT MY NEW TITLE AS THE KING OF KWANZA. (LAUGHTER) NOW OBVIOUSLY SOME MAY QUIBBLE WITH THE IDEA THAT NEWT GINGRICH MUST ENTER  INTO-- YEAH, YOU LIKE THAT, QUIBBLE WITH THE IDEA THAT NEWT GINGRICH MUST ENTER INTO THE BOWELS OF THE INNER  CITY TO EXPLAIN TO BLACK PEOPLE THE POWER OF THE PAYCHECK. SOME MAY MENTION THAT HALF OF FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS ARE ACTUALLY WHITE. THAT 75% OF FAMILIES RECEIVING FOOD STAMPS ALSO BRING HOME AT LEAST ONE PAYCHECK SO THEY ALSO WORK. IT MAY BE UNNECESSARY TO PERHAPS LECTURE AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON THEIR WORK ETHIC. NEWT'S GOT A PRETTY GOOD RESPONSE TO THAT.
THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE TOOK TOTALLY OUT OF CONTEXT, HALF OF THE SENTENCE. OKAY. I MEAN CLEARLY AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS SERVED WITH COLIN POWELL, SOMEBODY WHO HAS  SERVED WITH CONDI RICE, I HAVE A FAIRLY GOOD SENSE THAT, IN FACT, AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE MADE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO AMERICA.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, SERVED WITH? YOU MEAN WERE EMPLOYED BY THE GOVERNMENT AT THE SAME TIME AS. BELIEVE ME, I HAVE A FAIRLY GOOD SENSE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN'S CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER ALL I'M  TALKING TO YOU VIA A TELEVISION THE SAME BOX THAT ONCE BROADCAST THE COSBY SHOW SO I THINK-- AND OF  COURSE THE COSBY MYSTERIES WHICH WAS-- HERE IS THE GREAT THING ABOUT NEWTON  LEROY GINGRICH, HE IS NOT BEING DEFENSIVE. HE'S TRULY BEWILDERED THAT HE IS TAKING [BLEEP] FOR SAYING SOMETHING SO INCREDIBLY ALTRUISTIC.
I SAID I WOULD BE WILLING TO GO TO THE NAACP ANNUAL CONVENTION WHICH MOST  REPUBLICANS ARE NOT WILLING TO DO. AND I WILL WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FOOD STAMPS VERSUS PAYCHECKS. NOW I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A POSITIVE RESPONSE THAT SAYS  GOSH, HERE SAY REPUBLICAN WHO CARES ENOUGH THAT HE IS WILLING TO GO AND TALK TO  ONE OF THE MOST LEFT WING ORGANIZATIONS IN AMERICA, ABOUT HOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I'M WILLING TO HEAD DOWN TO THE SLUMS OF BALTIMORE, TAKING MY LIFE  INTO MY OWN HANDS AND TEACH YOU PEOPLE WHAT A PAYCHECK LOOKS LIKE. I BELIEVE THE PHRASE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS THANK YOU. (LAUGHTER) FOR MORE SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST WYATT CENAC JOINS US RIGHT NOW. WYATT WHAT DO YOU MAKE-- WHAT DOW MAKE OF THESE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE LATEST REMARKS BY NEWT GINGRICH.
JON, LET'S JUST SAY IT, THAT IS SOME RACIST BULL  [BLEEP]. I MEAN IT IS 2012. WHAT TOOK HIM SO LONG.
Jon: WAIT, ARE YOU UP SET HE HASN'T MADE RACIST REMARKS SOONER.
I DON'T KNOW IF HIS REMARKS WERE RACIST, THAT'S JUST NEWT BEING  CONDESCENDINGING AND DICKISH OR AS HE CALLS IT, TALKING. WHAT'S RACIST IS HIS TIMING. IT TOOK GINGRICH UNTIL NOW TO BE CONDESCENDING AND DICKISH TO BLACK PEOPLE? FIVE YEARS AGO HE WAS ALREADY DOING THIS TO HISPANICS.
WE SHOULD REPLACE BILINGUAL EDUCATION WITH IMMERSION IN ENGLISH SO THEY  LEARN THE LANGUAGE OF PROSPERITY, NOT THE LANGUAGE OF LIVING IN A GHETTO.
I NEVER HEARD HIM SAY THAT ABOUT RAT MUSIC OR EBONICS, WHAT, OUR LANGUAGE  OF LIVING IN THE GHETTO ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM?
Jon: CAN I JUST GO BACK FOR A SECOND. DID YOU JUST SAY SPANISH WAS THE LANGUAGE OF THE GHETTO?
OH, NO, BUT HE APOLOGIZED IN BROKEN GHETTO LANGUAGE.
SPEAKING SPANISH).
YEAH. IN THE CRAPPIEST SPANISH EVER, THAT GUY ALREADY PATRONIZED AND APOLOGISED TO  HISPANICS BEFORE HE EVER GOT AROUND TO INSULTING BLACK PEOPLE!
Jon: BUT, BUT ISN'T THAT IN AND OF ITSELF BY IGNORING BLACK PEOPLE INSULTING AND PATRONIZING.
NO, DON'T TRY AND MAKE ME FEEL BETTER. THIS GUY HAS BEEN A DICK TO GAYS, OTHER REPUBLICANS, SCIENCE, WOMEN.
TALKING ABOUT BEING IN COMBAT. WHAT IS COMBAT MEAN? IF COMBAT MEANS LIVING IN A DITCH, FEMALES HAVE BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS STAYING IN A DITCH FOR 30 DAYS. BECAUSE THEY GET INFECTIONS.
RIGHT, RIGHT, WOMEN ARE TOO FRAIL TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY. THIS COMING FROM A GUY WHO PROBABLY CAN'T GET OUT OF A POOL BY HIMSELF. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I MEAN LOOK, HE WAS CONDESCENDING AND DICKISH TO A CERTAIN PEOPLE THREE  MONTHS BEFORE GOING AFTER BLACK PEOPLE.
AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE HADN'T INVENTED PALESTINIAN PEOPLE WHO-- WERE  HISTORICALLY PART OF THE ARAB COMMUNITY.
HE DOESN'T THINK PALESTINIAN PEOPLE EXIST, JON! I MEAN I'M SURPRISED THE GUY DIDN'T [BLEEP] SMURFS BEFORE THINKING BLACK PEOPLE ARE  WORTHY OF HIS DISDAIN.
Jon: WYATT, MAYBE HE IS JUST SAVING THE BEST FOR LAST.
NO, NO, HUH-UH, WE HAVE WORKED TOO HARD AND COME TOO FAR TO NOT HAVE SOMEONE TELL  US WE DIDN'T WORK HARD ENOUGH. NO. BLACK PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SIT AT THE BACK OF THE BUS WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO  CALL US LAZY FOR BEING AT THE BACK OF THE BUS.
Jon: THANK YOU, WYATT. WYATT CENAC,
