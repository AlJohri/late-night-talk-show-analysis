Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, IT'S BEEN... IT'S BEEN OVER ONE YEAR SINCE ARIZONA GOVERNOR  JAN BREWER SIGNED SB-1070, A CONTROVERSIAL BILL THAT SOME CALL TANTAMOUNT TO RACIAL  PROFILING WITH SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
BASEBALL, NEARLY 30% HISPANIC, IS A FLASH POINT FOR PROTEST. BASEBALL'S ALL-STAR GAME SCHEDULED FOR PHOENIX NEXT SUMMER MAY HANG IN THE BALANCE.
Jon: THAT'S THE ONLY WAY HOW WE DECIDE WHO GETS HOMEFIELD  ADVANTAGE IN THE WORLD SERIES, UNLESS SOMEONE, YOU KNOW, PHILLIPS A QUARTER. ANYWAY, FOR MORE ON THE IMPACT OF SB-1070 ON THE ALL-STAR GAME, WE GO TO CHASE FIELD IN ARIZONA AND SENIOR LATINO CORRESPONDENT AL MADRIGAL. AL? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT A NIGHT FOR BASEBALL, JON. HISTORY IN THE MAKING. A LITTLE HOT. COULD BE THAT IT'S 127 DEGREES IN ARIZONA, OR I GOT A CASE OF BASEBALL FEVER. [CHUCKLING] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: AL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE COVERING THE PROTESTS ABOUT  THE LAW IN ARIZONA, NOT ENJOYING THE GAME. I THOUGHT THE LATINO COMMUNITY WAS FURIOUS ABOUT THIS?
OH, YES. RIGHT. THEY'RE FURIOUS, MUY FURIOUSO.
Jon: AL RUSSIA THERE PROTESTS? ARE YOU COVERING THE PROTESTS?
SURE. YES, IT'S... OH, COME ON, JON. IT'S BASEBALL, MAN. I MEAN, I'D PROTEST IF IT WAS ANY OTHER SPORT, BUT WE LOVE BASEBALL. IT'S THE ONLY SPORT A LATINO CAN DREAM OF PLAYING IN AMERICA. WE'RE TOO SHORT FOR BASKETBALL. WE'RE TOO SMALL FOR FOOTBALL, TOO SMART TO SCRAP ON A PAIR OF ICE SKATES AND LET A CANADIAN BEAT THE [BLEEPED] OUT OF US. [APPLAUSE] SO BESIDES DOG WHISPERING, BASEBALL IS ALLAH TINOS HAVE LEFT.
Jon: LATINOS LOVE BASEBALL AND DOG WHISPERING SO MUCH THEY'LL LOOK PAST ANY INJUSTICE  DONE TO THEM?
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE BATTLE OF CHAVEZ RAVINE? DURING THE 1950s, 3,800 MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR HOMES IN LOS ANGELES  SO THE NEWLY RELOCATED DODGERS COULD HAVE A STADIUM. GUESS WHAT THEY CALL THOSE PEOPLE TODAY? SEASON TICKET HOLDERS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT IS INCREDIBLE.
HOLD ON A SECOND. HEY!
Jon: SO ADRIAN GONZALEZ IS DOING WELL AND HE DOESN'T WANT  TO MISADVERTISE GAME, IS THAT IT? [LAUGHTER]
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, MAN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU CALLED THE VENDOR FOR A BEER AND THEN... AND THEN JUST  APPARENTLY TOOK IT FROM SOME  [BLEEPED] GUY WHO WAS STANDING AROUND. ANYWAY...
I DIDN'T REALIZE, SORRY, JON, I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS GUY WAS RIGHT HERE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: LAST YEAR, AL, YOU WERE... LAST YEAR... [LAUGHTER] LAST YEAR... WAITED. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. [LAUGHTER] LAST YEAR YOU WERE REALLY ANGRY ABOUT THIS ISSUE. ROLL THE TAPE.
AND THAT'S WHY MY MYSTERY BORE OF 2010 IS "SEX IN THE CITY 2."  IF I MAY, JON, JUST A QUICK PERSONAL MESSAGE FOR MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL COMMISSIONER BUD  SELIG, ARIZONA'S LAW IS RACIST AND HAVING THE ALL-STAR GAME THERE IS TOTAL BULL [BLEEPED].
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, AL. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN, THAT AL?
I DON'T KNOW. I LIKED THE FIRST "SEX IN THE CITY." I JUST THOUGHT THE SECOND WAS UNNECESSARY. WHY MESS WITH PERFECTION.
Jon: SO AL, THERE WILL BE ZERO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SB-1070 IN TONIGHT'S ALL-STAR GAME?
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT. PLAYERS ARE SHOWING SOLIDARITY. BENEATH EACH EYE, PLAYERS HAVE DECIDED TO WEAR THING BLACK MARKS SYMBOLIZING THE DARK TURN  IN ARIZONA POLITICS.
Jon: AL, PLAYERS DO THAT.
THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO GRAB THEIR BALLS AND SPIT.
Jon: I BELIEVER THEY DO THAT, AS WELL.
NO, BUT THIS TIME THEY'RE GOING TO MEAN IT. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, YOU CAN'T KEEP LATINOS FROM PLAYING BASEBALL. JUST LIKE THE GHOST FROM THE CORNFIELD IN THAT MOVIE WITH KEVIN COSTNER SAID, "IF YOU  BUILD IT, THEY WILL COME." AND BY "THEY," I MEAN HORDES OF LATINOS.
Jon: THANK YOU, AL. AL MADRIGAL, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
