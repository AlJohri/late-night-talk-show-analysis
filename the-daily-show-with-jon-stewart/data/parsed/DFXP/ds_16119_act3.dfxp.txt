WE'RE BACK. WE'RE TALKING WITH GOVERNOR MISSION DANIELS. WE'VE BEEN DANCING AROUND, BUT GETTING MORE DIRECTLY TO THE POINT, IT SEEMS LIKE THE  REPUBLICANS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PROTECT THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THIS  COUNTRY THROUGH POLICY AND THROUGH RHETORIC. AND I GUESS I'M JUST NOT UNDERSTANDING WHY. AND I'M HAVING A PROBLEM. THIS DECADE HAS NOT BEEN A BAD DECADE FOR THE WEALTHIEST OF AMERICANS, AND IF THEY ARE THE  JOB CREATORS, WHY ARE THEY NOT CREATING?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE DOING? IT FEELS LIKE FALSE ARGUMENT TO ME.
WELL, JON, YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUEST IF THAT'S YOUR  QUESTION BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TELLING MY FELLOW CITIZENS FOR AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN... THIS IS  THE ONLY ELECTED JOB I EVER INTEND TO BE IN. IT IS NOT OUR BUSINESS TO SEE THE PEOPLE OF GREAT MEANS MAKE MORE MONEY. IT IS OUR BUSINESS TO SEE THE PEOPLE WITHOUT MUCH MONEY HAVE CHANCE TO MAKE MORE. THAT'S WHAT'S BOTHERING ME.
Jon: SO YOU'RE A SOCIALIST?
SOCIALISM IS A VERY EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR SPREADING MISERY. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT.
Jon: IN YOUR MIND, IS THE RHETORIC YOU'RE HEARING FROM YOUR PARTY MISGUIDED?
WELL, I THINK IT CAN STAND SOME IMPROVEMENT. THAT'S THE BIGGEST POINT OF THIS BOOK. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAY TO FOLKS WHO GENERALLY LOOK AT THE WORLD  AS I DO, FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW, LET'S TRY TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF UNITY. THE PROBLEMS WE FACE ARE GOING TO TAKE A VERY LARGE CONSENSUS OF PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE  ABOUT OTHER THINGS WILL NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND SAY, LET'S TAKE  THE STEPS THAT WILL SAVE US ALL. NO ONE WILL SUFFER MORE IF WE DRIFT OVER FISCAL NIGHING A REMARKS WHICH WE ARE  MATHEMATICALLY CERTAIN TO BE HEADED FOR IF WE DON'T MAKE A FEW CHANGES. NO ONE WILL SUFFER MORE THAN THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. THEY ALWAYS DO. BUT IT'S A PRACTICAL QUESTION, AND I'M OPEN MINDED, AND I THINK OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD BE. I'VE SAID HERE AND IN OTHER PLACES, I'LL BE HAPPY TO TELL  YOU WHAT I THINK THE BEST WAY TO GET MORE REVENUE TO, GET MORE ECONOMIC GROWTH, TO GET THE  SPENDING, THE UNAFFORDABLE SPENDING DOWN, SO LET'S DO THAT. BUT YOU HAVE A SECOND BEST WAY, BRING IT ON, LET ME HEAR IT.
Jon: SO IN THE LANGUAGE OF UNITY, WHAT WOULD BE YOUR THREE STEPS, YOUR PRESCRIPTION? THE PRESCRIPTION I'VE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT APPEARS TO BE CUT SPENDING IN CERTAIN AREAS AND  RAISE TAXES ON THE TOP 1% OR ALLOW THE BUSH TAX...
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CUT SPENDING. I KEEP BEING REMINDED OF ST. AUGUSTINE, LORD, MAKE ME CHASTE, BUT NOT JUST YET.
Jon: WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
WE OUGHT TO SAVE THE SAFETY NET. YOU START BY SAYING THE PEOPLE WHO RELY ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE TODAY, DON'T WORRY  ABOUT A THING. NOTHING SHOULD CHANGE FOR YOU OR EVEN FOR THOSE PEOPLE APPROACHING THE SYSTEM. YOU ARE GOOD TO GO. A DEAL IS A DEAL. NOW, PLEASE HELP US CREATE A SOCIAL SECURITY 2.0 STARTING IN THE FUTURE SO THAT YOUNGER  PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING FOR YOUR RETIREMENT NOW HAVE A CHANCE TO BE PROTECTED, TOO. THAT SYSTEM SHOULD NOT... THE PRESIDENT'S OBSESSION WITH WEALTHY PEOPLE, FINE, BUT I  THINK HE'S LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE, EVERYBODY SHOULD CONTRIBUTE. THEY SHOULD START WITH THE BENEFITS. WHY ARE WE SENDING WARREN BUFFETT A PENSION CHECK.
Jon: GO BACK FOR A SECOND. THE PRESIDENT'S OBSESSION WITH WEALTHY PEOPLE. DOES HE HAVE AN OBSESSION?
I'M GLAD TO SEE...
Jon: WITH RAISING THE TAX RATE TO THE CLINTON ERA, IS THAT AN OBSESSION IN DO YOU REALLY  CONSIDER THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN BAD FOR RICH PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY? OR WALL STREET OR ANYTHING?
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN. IT'S THE CONSTANT BASHING. YOU CAN CONFISCATE ALL THE WEALTH OF THOSE PEOPLE AND WE WOULDN'T BE ANYWHERE.
Jon: LET ME GO TO THE LANGUAGE. "OBSESSION," "BASHING" AND "CONFISCATE." I UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF  UNITY, AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S IT. SO... AND I THINK THAT... I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THIS, SO IN THE LAST DECADE HERE, THE TOP 1%  HAVE TAKEN NEARLY 25% OF THE INCOME. 25 YEARS AGO IT WAS 1%. NOBODY HAS DONE BETTER IN THIS COUNTRY THAN THOSE PEOPLE. I'M INCLUDED IN IT. AND TO ASK THEM TO DO THAT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS HARD LINE,S THAT CLASS WARFARE, BUT  SOMEHOW MAKING THE MEDIAN IN THIS COUNTRY, 50%, WHICH NOW CONTROLS 2.5% OF THE WEALTH, THAT THAT POLICY IS NOT CLASS WARFARE, BUT TALKING ABOUT RAISING THE RATES 4%,S THAT CLASS WARFARE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT REALLY IS I THINK... AND AS MUCH AS... CLEARLY YOU'RE INCREDIBLY SMART, RESPECTED GUY, BUT THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU JUST USED AND SLIPPED INTO QUITE EASILY...
WELL, IF I GOT A LITTLE DEFENSIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE ASKING  ME TO DEFEND POSITIONS I HAVEN'T TAKEN. LOOK, I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, I THINK THE HEART OF OUR CHALLENGE IS TO RESTORE AND STRENGTHEN THE  UPWARD MOBILITY IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE POSSIBILITIES FOR A STABLE AND A HOPEFUL MIDDLE CLASS. AND IT'S A... THESE ARE PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW, I THINK IF YOU HAD A MORE PRO-GROWTH TAX SYSTEM, THE KIND I DESCRIBED EARLIER, THE  KIND THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION, HEADED THAT SAME DIRECTION, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE, YOU'D HAVE A SEPARATE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RATES. THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT RATES, I'M WITH YOU ON FAIRNESS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T SHOOT OURSELVES IN BOTH FEET BY RAISING THEM TO A POINT WHERE  THEY BEGIN TO HURT ECONOMIC GROWTH. GROWTH IS THE ABSOLUTE ESSENTIAL BOTH FOR PROSPERITY AND FOR FAIRNESS. [SEVEN MINUTES LATER]
Jon: HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY. NO, THEY'RE LOVELY PEOPLE. I APOLOGIZE IF YOU FEEL LIKE I WAS ASKING YOU QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW. THE PROBLEM IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET PAUL RYAN OR THOSE TYPES OF FOLKS TO COME ON  AND REALLY ANSWER IN AN HONEST WAY ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ON THESE TYPES OF SHOWS. AND THE REASON I WAS EXCITED TO HAVE YOU ON IS BECAUSE OF YOUR REPUTATION AS A SMART FISCAL  CONSERVATIVE THAT WAS NOT... SO I APOLOGIZE.
WELL, I HOPE YOU -- I DIDN'T LET YOU DOWN.
Jon: YOU DIDN'T LET ME DOWN. AND HONESTLY, I'M JUST EXCITED TO HAVE ANYBODY ELSE, WHEN I MEET THEM, WE'RE THE SAME HEIGHT. THAT'S THE TRUTH. "SAVING THE REPUBLIC." IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. [CHEERING A
