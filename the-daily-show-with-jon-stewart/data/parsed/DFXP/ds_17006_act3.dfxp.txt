(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT LONG TIME STAFF WRITER FOR THE "NEW YORKER"  MAGAZINE ALSO "THE NATION"'S DEADLINE POET. HI BOOK IS CALLED "QUITE ENOUGH OF CALVIN TRILLIN: 40 YEARS OF FUNNY STUFF."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM CALVIN TRILLIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU, SIR.
YOU GET HANDSOMER AT EACH SITTING.
I THINK DASHING IS A GOOD WORD.
Jon: PEOPLE DON'T USE THAT ENOUGH. QUITE ENOUGH OF CALVIN TRILLIN, THERE CAN NEVER BE ENOUGH OF CALVIN TRILLIN. I ENJOY YOUR WRITING SO MUCH AND I'M GLAD YOU WERE ON THE PROGRAM.
THANK YOU.
Jon: LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU WERE DISCUSSING TERRORISM, I BELIEVE.
YES. I TALKED ABOUT THE SHOE BOMBER AND MY NEAR THEY THAT WAS A PRANK.
Jon: WE HAVE THIS ON A CLIP. I WANT TO SHOW SOME PEOPLE. HERE'S A CLIP OF CALVIN TRILLIN.
THERE'S ONE ARAB TERRORIST WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR. HE SAID "I BET I CAN GET THEM ALL TO TAKE THEIR SHOES OFF IN AIRPORTS." (LAUGHTER)  IF THE NEXT ONE IS CALLED BECAUSE OF HIS M.O. THE UNDERWEAR BOMBER... (LAUGHTER) YOU'LL KNOW I'M ON TO SOMETHING. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: TWO THINGS THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLE. ONE YOU PREDICTED THE UNDERWEAR BOMBER.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: TWO, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN YOU'RE WEARING THE EXACT SAME SHOES.
THAT'S MY TERRORIST SUIT THAT I... (LAUGHTER) I AND THEN ON THE MOMENT OF ZEN YOU SHOWED A CLIP OF THAT HAVE A  FEW MOMENTS AGO AND MY GRANDSON WHO WAS THEN SEVEN SAID "BOBO  SAID UNDERWEAR ON TELEVISION." SO I GOT A LOT OF POINTS FOR THAT.
Jon: DOES HE WATCH THE PROGRAM OFTEN? THE SEVEN-YEAR-OLD?
ONLY WHEN HE CAN'T SLEEP. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BECAUSE THE SHOW'S REALLY AIMED FOR FOUR TO FIVE-YEAR-OLDS. SO HE'S A LITTLE FLONG THE TOOTH TO BE A REGULAR VIEWER. YOU KNOW, DO PEOPLE EVER GET ANGRY WITH YOU? BECAUSE YOU REALLY CAN WITH VERY WELL PLACED BARB, A CERTAIN JEST YOU CAN REALLY CUT DEEP SOMETIMES. DO YOU EVER GET A RESPONSE ON THAT FROM THEM?
WELL, SOMETIMES NOT THE PEOPLE WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT BUT  SOME OTHER PEOPLE SAID "AREN'T YOU ASHAMED OF YOURSELF MAKING A LIVING BY MAKING FUN OF  RESPECTABLE PUBLIC SERVANTS?" AND MY ONLY DEFENSE IS, IT'S NOT MUCH OF A LIVING. (LAUGHTER) BUT ALSO MY STUFF IN A WAY IS TOO SILLY TO REPLY TO. FOR INSTANCE, IN THE LAST CAMPAIGN I HAD A POEM ABOUT MITT ROMNEY WHICH WAS: YES MITT SO  SLICK OF SPEECH AND SLICK OF GARB HE REMINDS US OF ALL OF KEN OF KEN AND BARBIE  SO QUICK TO SHED HIS MODERATE REGALIA HE MAY, LIKE KEN BE LACKING GENITALIA (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: (LAUGHS)
SO HIS PRESS GUY IS NOT GOING TO WRITE ME AND SAY "THE  GOVERNOR DOES HAVE GENITALIA." (LAUGHTER) IT'S NO USE ARGUING WITH SOMEBODY LIKE ME. (LAUGHTER) AND ALSO I'M... I DON'T RUN INTO THOSE PEOPLE. BECAUSE I LIVE IN NEW YORK AND THEY LIVE IN WASHINGTON. I SOMETIMES... ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO I STARTED TO HAVE THIS NIGHTMARE THAT I WENT TO A  DINNER PARTY AND THEY WERE ALL THERE IN NEW YORK, I GET EARLY AND THE ONLY OTHER PERSON IS  STEVE FORBES, REMEMBER HIM? WITH THE MANIACAL GRIN?
Jon: FLAT TAX GUY.
YEAH, FLAT TAX AND I TRY TO BREAK THE ICE, I SAY "YOU MUST BE WONDERING WHY I KEPT  REFERRING TO YOU IN THE CAMPAIGN AS A DORK ROBOT." (LAUGHTER) AND BEFORE I CAN REPLY AL GORE  COMES ACROSS, HE'S STILL WEARING HIS EARTH TONE STUFF FROM THE CAMPAIGN... (LAUGHTER) ... AND GIVES A VERY WOODEN SPEECH ABOUT WHY I REFER TO HIM AS A MAN-LIKE OBJECT. (LAUGHTER) THEN HERE COMES SENATOR D'AMATO. REMEMBER HIM?
Jon: SURE, ALFONSE D'AMATO.
AND HE'S VERY ANGRY AND I SAID "WELL, IT'S A MATTER OF  RHYMING, INFORMS A POEM I INSULTED HIM." AND D'AMATO... IT RHYMES WITH  TOE MATO SO I CAN'T REALLY SAY TOE MATO. BUT IT DOES RIME WITH SLEEZE BALL OBLIGATO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO I WOULD.
Jon: I WOULD IMAGINE A GUY LIKE GORE YOU COULD HAVE A FIELD DAY WITH IN TERMS OF RHYMES.
OH, GALORE, YES.
Jon: RHYMES GALORE. BORE. THE WHOLE THING IS REALLY... HE'S ALMOST SET UP... IT'S ALMOST ENTRAPMENT IN SOME WAYS.
BOB DOLE WITH GOOD TOO WITH OLD KING COAL AND ESCAROLE.
Jon: ROMNEY'S TOUGH.
ROMNEY'S VERY BAD.
Jon: I THINK YOU WERE RIGHT TO GO WITH GENITALIA. (LAUGHTER)
ACTUALLY, OBAMA... I HATE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PRESIDENT BUT  I USED UP ALL THE RHYMES WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN. (LAUGHTER) YOKOHAMA, SLAP YO MAMA. COME ONNA.
Jon: COME ON ALONG.
OH, YES, OKAY. YOU MUST BE A CHAMPION SCRABBLE PLAYER TO COME UP WITH THAT ONE.
Jon: I JUST HIT BEST WORD AND TRY AND LEAVE THE WORD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BY.
THANK YOU.
Jon: ALWAYS SO ENTERTAINING. "QUITE ENOUGH OF CALVIN TRILLIN." LET'S BE HONEST, IT'S NOT ENOUGH. IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
