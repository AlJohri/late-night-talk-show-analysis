( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, AS YOU KNOW, WHEN BARACK OBAMA WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT, ONE GROUP IN  PARTICULAR VERY CONCERNED.
WHILE THE RESULTS OF TUESDAY'S ELECTION LED TO CELEBRATIONS IN SOME PART OF THE  COUNTRY, THIS OTHERES, THERE'S BEEN A BOOM IN GUN SALES.
I HONESTLY BELIEVE THESE GOING TO PUT AN END TO CERTAIN TYPES OF WEAPONS.
ELECTION DAY, PEOPLE WAKE UP THINKING, OBAMA WON. THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR GUNS AWAY TOMORROW.
Jon:  TOMORROW? ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S A PRESIDENT. HE'S NOT MAGNETO. ( LAUGHTER ) EVEN HE WAS MAGNETO, THERE'S NO WAY TO REALLY DIFFERENTIATE  BETWEEN GUNS AND POSTERS. ANYWAY, THINGS DIDN'T QUITE TURN OUT THAT WAY.
SENSE THE PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE, HE HAS ACTUALLY SIGNED BILLS LOOSENING GUN CONTROL, INCLUDING ALLOWING GUNS TO BE CARRIED IN NATIONAL PARKS AND IN LUGGAGE ON AMTRAK TRAINS.
SO FAR THE ONLY GUN LEGISLATION THE PRESIDENT HAS SIGNED ARE LAWS THE N.R.A. ACTUALLY WANTED.
THE PRESIDENT'S RECORD ON GUNS HAS EARNED HIM STRAIGHT  "Fs" FROM THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE.
Jon:  HA! THE JOKE'S ON YOU, BRADY CAMPAIGN, BECAUSE HE GOT "Fs,"  THAT MEANS HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO REPEAT HIS FIRST TERM. OBAMA'S GIVEN EVERYTHING THE N.R.A. COULD HAVE WANTED. THAT OUGHT TO MAKE THEIR C.E.O., WAYNE LAPIERRE, A PRETTY HAPPY MAN.
IT'S A BIG, FAT, STINKIN LIE. IT'S ALL PART OF A MASSIVE OBAMA CONSPIRACY TO DECEIVE VOTERS AND HIDE HIS TRUE INTENTIONS TO  DESTROY THE SECOND AMENDMENT IN OUR COUNTRY.
Jon:  GO ON?
THAT'S THEIR AGENDA. IF ANYONE DOUBTS THAT, THINK. USE YOUR COMMON SENSE ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  OR USE MINE-- I'M CLEARLY NOT USING IT. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S JUST SITTING IN MY BRAIN COLLECTING DUST. BARACK OBAMA'S BEEN GOOD TO THE N.R.A., BUT FOR LAPIERRE, IF YOU WANT TO TAKE AWAY HIS  PRECONCEIVED NARRATIVE, YOU HAVE TO PRY IT FROM HIS COLD, DEAD, HANDS.
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT WAS EVEN SWORN INTO OFFICE, THEY MET AND THEY HAD THE CONSPIRACY OF  PUBLIC DECEPTION TO TRY TO GUARANTEE HIS REELECTION IN 2012. THEY CONCOCKED A SCHEME TO STAY AWAY FROM THE GUN ISSUE, LULL GUN OWNERS TO SLEEP AND PLAY US  FOR FOOLS IN 2012.
Jon:  BARACK OBAMA WILL COURT HIS LIBERAL BASE BY RUNNING ON CHANGE, GET ELECTED, FAIL TO DELIVER THE CHANGE WITH A CONGRESS FROM HIS SAME PARTY, THUS ALIENATING THAT BASE IN AN ATTEMPT TO WIN OVER THE PEOPLE THAT HATE HIM NO MATTER WHAT, ENSURING HIS VICTORY IN 2012, WHERE HE IS & A CONGRESS FROM THE OPPOSING PARTY CAN FINALLY TAKE AWAY ALL YOUR GUNS. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S JUST SO CRAZY, IT'S ( BLEEP ) CRAZY. ( APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
