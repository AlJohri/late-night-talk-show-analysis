MY CHARACTER IS BEING INDUCTED INTO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE ON THURSDAY.
Jon: WHY? WHY IS THAT HAPPENING?
JON, THIS IS THE SAME QUESTION I AM GOING TO ASK THE SMITHSONIAN PEOPLE ON THURSDAY.
Jon: HOW DO THEY LET YOU KNOW, YOU JUST GET A LETTER, THIS IS A FUND-RAISING SCAM, HOW MUCH MONEY DOES IT COST YOU.
YOU GET -- LISTEN IF I COULD HAVE PAID MY WAY INTO THE SMITHSONIAN I WOULD HAVE  DONE IT YEARS AGO. YOU CAN'T. THEY JUST PUT YOU IN. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED. I DONE EVEN KNOW -- I THINK THEY ACTUALLY THINK IT IS DAFOE. THEY THINK DAFOE PLAYS THE GUY SO WHEN I GET THERE ON THURSDAY THEY WILL GET A  GOOD LOOK AND GO WAY WAIT A MINUTE, WE THOUGHT YOU WERE THE PLATOON GUY AND -- BUT I  DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENS. BUT WE'RE GOING IN THERE.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DONATE, DO YOU HAVE TO DONATE SOMETHING?
THEY ASK FOR SOMETHING SO IT IS TOMMY GAFFEIN'S HELMUT AND BUNKER JACKET IS GOING IN.
Jon: DID YOU TELL THEM YOU BARGAIN WITH THEM OR JUST ALL RIGHT, LIKE WHAT DID YOU --

Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT, HONESTLY, ONE OF THE THINGS --
MY COCREATE CERTIFICATE GOING TOO, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE SAID IS LET'S GET  A LIST OF THE TED KENNEDY, THE BARS HE USED TO GO TO AND GO ON A TED KENNEDY TOUR BECAUSE WE'RE LOW RENT IRISH.
Jon: DO YOU THINK HE USED TO GO TO -- WHEN HE WAS ON THIS SHOW, GOD REST HIS SOUL, BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY.
HE CAME ON THIS SHOW.
Jon: HE STLUTLY DID. HE BROUGHT ME THE LITTLE DUCKLINGS BOOK FOR MY KIDS. GO BACK TO SEE HIM IN THE GREEN ROOM, THIS IS TRUE, HE IS BACK THERE, PANTS ON, BUT  HE'S IN THE GREEN ROOM DIGGING THROUGH THAT LITTLE GIFT BASKET AND HE FINDS THE  VODKA BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE PUT VODKA IN THERE AND HE LITERALLY DOES THIS, WHEN I  WALK IN, THIS IS WHAT I SEE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BUT IT -- IT WAS LIKE A CARTOON. HE JUST LOOKED UP AND WENT YEAH!
