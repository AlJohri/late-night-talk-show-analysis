JUNE 27, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. TONIGHT JENNIFER ANISTON. JENNIFER ANISTON WILL BE HERE. I HOPE I'M NOT TOO EXHAUSTED. I HAD A CRAZY WEEKEND. YESTERDAY LIKE EVERY YEAR IN THE END OF JUNE LAST WEEKEND I DRESS IN GLITTER LIKE A PEACOCK. I MARCH DOWN FIFTH AVENUE TO RAISE AWARENESS OF EXOTIC BIRDS. AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THIS YEAR ALMOST MORE THAN ANY OTHER YEAR IT WENT REALLY REALLY WELL. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE SUPPORT I WAS GETTING. PEOPLE ARE LIKE THIS IS A GREAT DAY. IT'S BEEN TOO LONG. I WAS LIKE, YEAH, EXOTIC BIRDS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND THEN PEOPLE ARE LIKE WASN'T FRIDAY AMAZING? I WAS LIKE WHY? WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY?
IT IS A HISTORY-MAKING NIGHT WITH A VOTE THAT JUST HAPPENED A SHORT TIME AGO. NEW YORK BECOMES THE 7th JURISDICTION IN AMERICA TO RECOGNIZE MARRIAGE FOR SAME SEX COUPLES.
Jon: THAT'S A MAJOR CIVIL RIGHTS VICTORY. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NEW YORK, FINALLY, NEW YORK  STATE'S GAY AND LESBIAN COMMUNITY ARE FREE FROM THE BURDEN THAT WAS HAVING TO SET  FOOT IN CONNECTICUT IN ORDER TO GET MARRIED. ( APPLAUSE ) REALLY? THE NUPTIALS ARE IN STAM FORWARD? MMMM. YES, IT WAS LAST FRIDAY NIGHT AT 10:30 P.M. EASTERN GAY RIGHTS TIME AFTER A WEEK OF  TENSE NEGOTIATIONS AND PROTESTS FEATURING BRUTAL GAY VERSUS JEW BULL FIGHTING, THE  SENATE IN AL BANY FINALLY MADE AN HONEST STATE OF NEW YORK BY A VOTE OF 33 FOR DESTROYING  SOCIETY AS WE KNOW IT AND 29 AGAINST. THE VOTE WAS IN DOUBT RIGHT UP UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE. AS OF THURSDAY, THE STATE SENATE WAS DEAD LOCKED 31-31. MARRIAGE RIGHTS SUPPORTERS HAD TO FIND AT LEAST ONE MORE REPUBLICAN TO FLIP. AND THEN UP STEPPED MARK GRISANTI, STATE SENATOR FROM BUFFALO, WHO HAD RUN ON A  PLATFORM OF BANNING GAY MARRIAGE. HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
AS A CATHOLIC I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN.
Jon: SO WE'LL MOVE ON FROM THERE. MAYBE THEY'LL FIND A VOTE FROM SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T APPEAR TO  BE ON ELLIOTT NESS'S ENEMY LIST.
I CANNOT LEGALLY COME UP WITH AN ARGUMENT AGAINST SAME SEX MARRIAGE. WHO AM I TO SAY THAT SOMEONE DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS THAT I HAVE WITH MY WIFE WHO I  LOVE OR TO HAVE THE 1300-PLUS RIGHTS THAT I SHARE WITH HER? I VOTE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, MR. PRESIDENT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SO IMPRESSED. IN HONOR OF THIS MAN, IN HONOR OF THIS GREAT MAN, I WILL NO LONGER DO MY OFFENSIVE ITALIAN  NEW YORKER VOICE. FOR AS LONG AS... BECAUSE IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU SEE THIS SON OF A B... THE COURAGE THAT THIS  MOTHER (BEEP), THE GIANT (BEEP) HANGING OVER THIS MAN LIKE BOCCE BALLS ON A SUMMER AFTERNOON. I'M SORRY. IT'S VERY HARD NOT TO DO THE VOICE. IT'S A VERY FUN VOICE. SO WITH SUPPORT OF GRISANTI AND HIS FELLOW REPUBLICAN STEVEN SALAN GAY MARRIAGE  PASSED AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW WITH THAT MEANS.
THE CITY ESTIMATES THE NEW LAW WILL BRING MORE THAN $180 MILLION TO THE STATE IN THE  NEXT THREE YEARS.
Jon: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ALL RIGHT. ALSO CASHING IN THE PERFECT TIME TO ROLL OUT MY NEW JON STEWART BRAND TUXEDOS. ALL THE ELEGANCE OF A TUXEDO BUT WITH THE FLATTERING PHYSIQUE.
(CAT YOWLING).
Jon: INDEED. FRAY FRY'S DECISION BRINGS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STATES PERMITTING GAY MARRIAGE TO 7. 41 OTHER STATES STILL HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS EXPLICITLY BANNING SAME SEX MARRIAGE. IT'S WHY MANY GAY ACTIVISTS ARE LOOKING FOR FEDERAL ACTION TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL MARRIAGE EQUALITY. LAST THURSDAY BARACK OBAMA ADDRESSED THAT VERY QUESTION.
I HAVE LONG BELIEVED THAT THE SO-CALLED DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT OUGHT TO BE REPEALED.
Jon: HEAR, HEAR, YEAH! I ASSUME THE PRESIDENT'S PROBLEM WITH THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT IS THAT IT SHOULD  BE A FEDERAL LAW IN SUPPORT OF GAY MARRIAGE.
PART OF THE REASON THAT DOMA DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IS THAT TRADITIONALLY MARRIAGE  HAS BEEN DECIDED BY THE STATES. (AUDIENCE GROANING).
Jon: REALLY? THE GENTLEMAN WITH MIXED RACE PARENTS PLAYING THE STATES NO BEST CARD. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS BORN... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WHEN I WAS BORN MY PARENTS'  MARRIAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL IN FLORIDA AND VIRGINIA. SO DIFFERENT STROKES. OF COURSE THE IMPLICATIONS OF LEGALIZING GAY MARRIAGE CAN BE HARD TO FULLY UNDERSTAND  UNLESS PERHAPS YOU HAVE A CORRESPONDENT WHO WAS IN MUSICAL THEATER. WE SENT OUR OWN JOSH GAD FROM THE BOOK OF MORMON OUT TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS LANDMARK LEGISLATION.
Reporter: THE LEGALIZATION OF GAY MARRIAGE MEANS ONE THING. SUPER BOWL HERO DAVID TIREE.
THIS WILL BE THE BEGINNING OF OUR COUNTRY SLIDING TOWARD, YOU KNOW, IT'S A STRONG WORD BUT ANARCHY.
Reporter: NOW EVERYONE FROM AL BANY TO ROCHESTER WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHAT PEOPLE HERE  IN THIS CITY HAVE LONG HAD TO ACCEPT AS PART OF THEIR DAILY LIVES. TRAFFIC SNARLS. SAILORS GONE AWOL.
IT'S LIKE AN AVERAGE DAY IN THE GAY COMMUNITY. ISN'T SNIT.
NO. THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL DAY THAT WE HAVE.
Reporter: SIR, MAY I ASK YOU A QUICK QUESTION. HOW IS THIS NOT LIKE THE APOCALYPSE?
THIS IS A (BEEP) PARADE, DUDE.
Reporter: IT REMINDS ME A BIT OF THAT PASSAGE FROM REVELATION. I SAW A HORSE AND ITS RIDER WAS WEARING A JOCK STRAP AND HELL FOLLOWED.
I DON'T READ THE BIBLE.
Reporter: IT'S IN THERE, PAGE 42.
WHAT KIND OF PARADE IS IN STORE FOR TOMORROW?
I DON'T THINK ANY OTHER PARADE BECAUSE WE HAVE PRIDE ONLY ONCE A YEAR.
Reporter: YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS THE PARADE BUT IN REALITY THE ST. PATRICK'S DAY  PARADE IS A VERY ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF HOW IRISH PEOPLE BEHAVE EVERYDAY.
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL.
Reporter: I WOULD.
BECAUSE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT MAKING A MESS ON  ST. PATRICK'S AREN'T EVEN IRISH.
Reporter: BUT IRISH PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GETTING DRUNK AND VOMITING AND INSIDE SUBWAY STATIONS. TAKE A GOOD LOOK, UPSTATE. NORMAL RESPECTABLE PEOPLE LIKE THIS WILL HAVE NOWHERE TO TURN. ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE REPERCUSSIONS OF GAY MARRIAGE?
YEAH, I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.
Reporter: ARE YOU GAY?
I'M GAY.
Reporter: I FISH WITH GUYS LIKE YOU.
THANKS. WE LOOK LIKE OTHER PEOPLE.
Reporter: AMAZING. YOU'RE NOT GAY.
THEY'RE GAY AND I'M GAY.
Reporter: REALLY? DAVID TIREE. DAVID, TIREE SUPER BOWL HERO BRAVELY SHOWING HIS FACE AT GAY PRIDE PARADE. UNBELIEVE AL. IT'S BECOME CLEAR TO ME THAT YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY DAVID TIREE. EVEN THOUGH I WAS ON BROADWAY ONCE THEY FOUND OUT I WAS A....
I LOVED YOU IN THE BOOK OF MORMON. TOO BAD YOU DIDN'T WIN.
Reporter: ARE YOU FROM THE BOOK OF MORMON? OH, MY GOD.
Reporter: ALL RIGHT. I HOPE YOU GUYS HAVE FUN (BEEP) YOURSELVES. IT BECAME CLEAR THAT NO ONE, NOT EVEN THIS INTREPID REPORTER, WAS IMMUNE FROM THEIR TAKEOVER.
I THINK THAT NEW YORK IS A PART OF THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. NEW YORK IS GOING TO STILL BE NEW YORK. JUST A PART OF EVERYTHING ELSE.
Reporter: REALLY?
YES.
Reporter: THEN HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? THREE MINUTES AGO I WAS WEARING A SUIT. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I EVEN GOT IN THESE.
GOOD LUCK, BUFFALO. YOU'LL NEED IT.
Jon: ANARCHY.
