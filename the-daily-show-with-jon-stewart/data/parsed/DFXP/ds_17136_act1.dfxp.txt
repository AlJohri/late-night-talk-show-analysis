Pelley: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO DALE DALE. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT SAIMA WAHAB, SHE'S WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE GOING UP IN AFGHANISTAN AND PORTLAND, OREGON. (LAUGHS) SISTER CITIES. YOU KNOW THE SAYING "YOU ARE WHERE YOU EAT?" YOU DON'T? BECAUSE I HAVE MADE THAT UP. AND YET FOR THE COUNTRY'S LEADING CONSERVATIVES. TWEET AGO PICTURE OF THEMSELVES WITH CHICK-FIL-A RECENTLY BECAME A GREAT WAY TO EXPRESS  OPPOSITION TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. A LITMUS LUNCH, IF YOU WILL. PALIN, HUCKABEE, LIMBAUGH, EVEN, SURPRISINGLY, THIS MIDDLE AGED LESBIAN. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) HAS A... (LAUGHTER). (LAUGHS) ARE YOU SURE? THAT'S ACTUALLY SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM. (LAUGHTER) LINDSAY'S A BOY'S NAME? NO. NO, THAT'S A LESBIAN! OKAY. ANYWAY, LAST WEEK GRAHAM POSTED HIS PICTURE ON FACEBOOK SAYING "AS A LONG TIME CHICK-FIL-A  FANATIC I STAND WITH CHICK-FIL-A. WE HAD IT FOR BREAKFAST TODAY BUT MY USUAL ORDER IS THE NUMBER ONE ORD WE ARE LAW IS AND A COKE ZERO. " COKE ZERO! DOESN'T HE KNOW THAT IS THE GAYEST COKE! (LAUGHTER) EVEN DIET CAFFEINE FREE COKE IS LIKE "GIVE IT A REST, COKE ZERO." (LAUGHTER)  BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT SOCIAL MEDIA CAN BE A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD?
I'M WAITING IN LINE, NEXT IN LINE, PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT MY FREE WATER.
YOU KNOW WHY I'M GETTING A FREE WATER, RIGHT?
I DO NOT.
BECAUSE CHICK-FIL-A IS A HATEFUL CORPORATION.
I DISAGREE, I WOULDN'T... WE DON'T TREAT ANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS DIFFERENTLY.
Jon: THAT GENTLEMAN IS A SUPPORTER OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND HE'S APPARENTLY CONFUSING  THIS WELL-MANNERED HOURLY SHIFT WORKER FOR MRS. CHICK-FIL-A. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, EVERYONE KNOWS CHICK-FIL-A COMPANY POLICY IS SET BY THE GUY WORKING THE  WAFFLE FRIES. (LAUGHTER) LOOK, MAN, OH, MAN, THIS GUY WASN'T DUN SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWERLESSNESS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF AND WORK HERE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THIS IS A HORRIBLE CORPORATION WITH HORRIBLE VALUES.
WE'RE HERE TO SERVE YOU IN ANY WAY THAT YOU NEED. I HOPE OFF REALLY NICE DAY.
I WILL. I DID SOMETHING REALLY GOOD. I FEEL PURPOSEFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: OH, I SHOULD CLARIFY, MY PURPOSE IS TO BE A DICK. (LAUGHTER) THE BEST PART OF THAT DEAL? THAT DUDE POSTED THAT VIDEO! HIMSELF! (LAUGHTER) HE UPLOADED THAT TO A COMPUTER AND IS LIKE "WAIT UNTIL THE WORLD SEES THIS!"  AND WHY NOT? HE HAD NOTHING TO BE PERSONALLY ASHAMED OF.
I'M A NICE GUY, BY THE WAY. AND I'M TOTALLY HETEROSEXUAL. I'M NOT... NOT A GAY IN ME. I JUST CAN'T STAND THE HATE, YOU KNOW? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOUR COMPANY SUCKS AND I DON'T BLOW DUDES SO, UP... (LAUGHTER). SO JUST... I THINK YOUR COMPANY SHOULD BE RESPECT, I DON'T (BLEEP) GUYS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING IS I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE A TALK WITH THEM  ABOUT THEIR POLICY. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, QUICK MESSAGE TO CHICK-FIL-A H.Q.: GIVE THIS WOMAN A RAISE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SHE'S A SAINT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOT EASY TO FIND THAT TYPE OF FOREIGN TAKE A THANKLESS FAST FOOD JOB.
AN EMPLOYEE AT A LOCAL TACO BELL HAS BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A PICTURE HE POSTED ON TWITTER.
Jon: PLEASE DON'T BE A PICTURE OF SOMEONE PEEING ON NACHOS. PLEASE DON'T BE A PICTURE OF SOMEONE PEEING ON NACHOS.
THAT PICTURE APPEARS TO BE AN EMPLOYEE URINATING IN A NACHO BELL GRANDE. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: NO! NOT A NACHO BELL GRANDE! (LAUGHTER) UNLESS... IS THAT WHAT MAKES THEM GRANDE? (LAUGHTER) I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH. ALL RIGHT, LET ME SEE. OH! (AUDIENCE REACTS) ACTUALLY, THAT'S A FAKE, UNLESS THIS PERSON HAS LEARNED TO PEE  OUT OF HIS KNEE. (LAUGHTER) AND, BY THE WAY, QUICK EDITORIAL OTE: REPORTING THIS STORY PAINSN ME DEEPLY. NOT ONLY BECAUSE TACO BELL IS A MAJOR SPONSOR OF THIS PROGRAM BUT BECAUSE NACHO BELL GRANDE  ARE SO DELICIOUS. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH SOCIAL MEDIA. IT'S EASY TO FORGET THE WHOLE WORLD CAN SEE WHAT YOU POST. NOT TO MENTION YOUR IDENTITY.
THE FORT WAYNE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CONFIRMED THAT EMPLOYEE IS CAMERON JANKOWSKI. I'M TOLD HE HAS SINCE BEEN SUSPENDED. (AUDIENCE REACTS) (LAUGHTER) STPHAOUPB WOW. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I DIDN'T KNOW WHO DID THIS, BUT THAT'S  THE KID I WOULD GUESS DID THIS. (LAUGHTER) THAT PICTURE IS BASICALLY JUST HIM SAYING "YEAH, I PEED IN YOUR NACHOS. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M TAKING YOUR DAUGHTER OUT FOR A  NIGHT OF BONG HITS AND STREET RACING. DON'T WORRY, POPS, I BROUGHT CONDOMS. HERE, HAVE SOME (BLEEP)ING NACHOS." BY THE WAY, THE KID DIDN'T PEE  IN THE NACHOS, IT WAS JUST MOUNTAIN DUE AND HE WAS PRANKING HIS FRIENDS LEADING TO THIS NEW  SHOW "JANKIN' IT!" IRONICALLY ALSO SPONSORED BY TACO BELL. EXCEPT FOR YOU, YOU'RE IMMORTAL, EAT SIX TIMES A DAY! SO IT SEEMS THE SOCIAL MEDIA/PREPARED FOODS HYBRID MEDIA EVENT IS BECOMING AN  ENTIRE GENRE OF A THING. MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE HAS TO BE THIS ONE FROM MINNESOTA. THIS GAY MARRIAGE OPPONENT TAPED HIS PROTEST OF THE GAY MARRIAGE SUPPORTING COMPANY THAT MAKES CHEERIOS.
THIS IS REALLY THE TREAT, NOW WITH THE HOMOSEXUALS AND THIS IS  OUR PROTEST OF GENERAL MILLS, THEY'RE ADVOCATING SAME-SEX MARRIAGES. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, I THINK I KNOW THE BEST WAY TO PUT THAT FIRE OUT. JANKOWSKI! (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
