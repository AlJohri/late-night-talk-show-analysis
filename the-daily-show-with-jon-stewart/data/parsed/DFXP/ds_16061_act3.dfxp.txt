WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A NEW FILM CALLED LAST NIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I HAVE SOME WORK HERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M FINE. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE. HOW DID YOU KNOW I'D BE HERE?
I KEEP TABS ON YOU.
SERIOUS.
SO AM I. CHRISTMAS CARDS HAVE A RETURN ADDRESS ON THEM.
WHAT IF I HAD MOVED.
YOU HAVEN'T.
HOW LONG ARE YOU IN NEW YORK FOR?
I LEAVE TOMORROW.
Jon: HE KILLS HER. IN THE MOVIE. OOPS! PLEASE WELCOME BACK KIERA KNIGHTLEY. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  OBVIOUSLY HE DOES NOT KILL YOU  IN THE MOVIE.
HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T.
Jon: A COMICAL THING TO SAY.
YES. I JUST GOOGLEED SANTORUM. I FEEL LIKE MY INNOCENCE HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY. IT'S THE USE OF THE WORD "FROTHY" THAT I THINK IS QUITE....
Jon: CAN I SAY SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY ABOUT THAT.
DO YOU HAVE TO.
Jon: YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT.
Jon: HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE A DRAWBACK.
OR NOT MAYBE. MAYBE THAT'S A GREAT THING.
Jon: WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY DO YOU THINK WE ARE? HOW IS YOUR COUNTRY? YOU SHOT THIS IN NEW YORK.
YES.
Jon: IN 2008.
ACTUALLY WHEN OBAMA WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT WE WERE SHOOTING THAT NIGHT. WE WERE TRYING TO SHOOT THAT NIGHT.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING, THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DO HERE. WE GO MENTAL ALL THE TIME. HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ELECTION. FIRST TUESDAY IN NOVEMBER EVERY YEAR.
OH, GREAT.
Jon: WE GO SANTORUM. ( APPLAUSE ) WAS THAT A STRANGE FEELING? WERE YOU OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER NOT TONY BLAIR, I WOULDN'T THINK, TAKING POWER.
YES, I CAN REMEMBER THAT.
Jon: SIMILAR TYPE VIBE.
YES, YES. IT WAS PRETTY BIG THEN AS WELL.
Jon: IF YOU HAD BEEN HERE DURING THE ELECTION, LET'S SEE, OF 2000, NEW YORK WAS QUIETER.
I CAN IMAGINE THAT, YES.
Jon: WE WERE NERVOUS.
YES. YES, I CAN IMAGINE THAT AS WELL.
Jon: BUT THINGS WENT BETTER. DID YOU GET TO GO BACK HOME FOR THE NUPTIALS, THE ROYAL WEDDING?
I WAS. I WAS DOING THEATER IN LONDON. I WAS THERE FOR THE NUPTIALS.
Jon: WHAT WAS THAT?
THE NUPTIALS.
Jon: YES.
I BELIEVE IT WAS A WEDDING, I THINK.
Jon: I SEE. WHAT IF I GOOGLED... IS THERE... WOULD THE WILLIAM AND... UH... MIDDLE... KATE.
YES.
Jon: DO YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE IN ENGLAND AS BIG A DEAL AS THEY WERE HERE OR DO YOU  THINK AMERICANS WERE MORE FASCINATED?
IT WAS A BIG DEAL HERE. WASN'T IT.
Jon: WE STOPPED EVERYTHING.
DID YOU? WERE YOU THERE?
Jon: STOPPING OR IN ENGLAND?
WERE YOU STOPPING IN ENGLAND.
Jon: WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO EVEN USE THE FOOTAGE FROM INSIDE THE CHURCH. THE ROYAL FAMILY HAD PUT OUT I GUESS THEY CALL THEM A DECREE.
OH.
Jon: THEY SAID THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THE FOOTAGE FOR SATIRICAL PURPOSES. ONLY TO COMMENT... THERE WERE ONLY THREE THINGS YOU WERE ALLOWED TO SAY, COMMENT ON THE FOOTAGE. YOU WERE ALLOWED TO SAY (HA-FF-) THEY MADE IT SO THAT YOU COULDN'T MAKE JOKES.
DID THEY REALLY? REALLY? I'M SORRY. I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD APOLOGIZE. I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
Jon: THIS IS NOT YOU.
THIS IS NOT MY FAULT. OKAY.
Jon: IT'S KIND OF IN SOME WAYS CRYSTALIZES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. YOUR COUNTRY DOES SOMETHING DIGNIFIED WITH GREAT POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE BRINGING TOGETHER  TWO PEOPLE IN HOLY MATRIMONY AND LOVE. WE DRESSED IN RAGS (BEEP) ON IT FOR NO REASON.
IT'S FINE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I FORGIVE YOU.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THEY'RE AROUND YOUR AGE. HAVE YOU EVER RUN INTO THEM WHILE YOU'RE OUT? WILLIAM OR HAROLD?
HE CALLED HAROLD? HENRY. IS IT HENRY?
Jon: LET ME CHANGE IT TO HAROLD. HARRY.
HENRY IS THE REAL NAME AND HARRY IS THE NICKNAME.
I SHOULD KNOW THAT, SHOULDN'T I.
Jon: YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. LET'S CHANGE HIS NAME TO SOMETHING ELSE.
I LIKE HAROLD.
Jon: HAROLD IS NICE.
I THOUGHT HAROLD WAS QUITE GOOD. IT SORT OF SEEMED REGAL.
Jon: KING HAROLD. HARK THE HERALD ANGELS SING. BUT I WOULD THINK THAT THE ROYAL... BEING A ROYAL NOWADAYS WOULD BE LIKE BEING A MOVIE STAR. I WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE SOME SING RON ITITY BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS.
DOES THAT MEAN I SHOULD MEET THEM.
Jon: I WOULD THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE... LET'S SAY I'M PRINCE HARRY. I'M HANGING OUT AND WEARING WHATEVER A PRINCE WEARS.
THE SUITS WERE QUITE COOL.
Jon: VERY NICE SUITS AND VERY FANCY. LET'S HAVE PRINCE HARRY. I GO, MAN, THAT KIERA KNIGHTLEY SHE'S SOMETHING. SHE'S A GREAT ACTRESS. YOU KNOW WHAT? I WILL MEET HER. DON'T YOU THINK THEY WOULD DO THAT.
THEY HAVEN'T. IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME.
Jon: HERE'S MY POINT. EVEN THEY REALIZE YOU'RE OUT OF THEIR LEAGUE. EVEN THEY. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU SO MUCH. I KNOW WHAT SANTORUM IS SO I'M NOT ALLOWED IN THE PALACE ANYMORE.
Jon: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN THE PALACE?
NO I HAVEN'T.
Jon: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO LONDON? FAIR ENOUGH. IF I GO THERE, CAN I HANG WITH YOU GUYS.
ABSOLUTELY. ME AND HAROLD.
Jon: WHOEVER. WHEN YOU COME HERE NEXT TIME, YOU'RE COMING WHEN WE ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT. WE'LL DO IT JUST FOR YOU. LAST NIGHT IS OPEN IN SELECT CITIES NOW. KIERA KNIGHTLEY. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
