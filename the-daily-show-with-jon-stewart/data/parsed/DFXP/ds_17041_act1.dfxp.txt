I WONDER WHAT GOING IS ON IN THE WORLD.
IRAN IS DEFYING THE REST OF THE WORLD STARTING PRODUCTION AT A SECOND URANIUM ENRICHMENT SITE.
THIS URANIUM ENRICHMENT IS TAKING PLACE AT A SITE CALLED FORDO.
Jon: AH, FORDO NAMED FOR THE FAMED HERO OF LORD OF THE RINGS KNOCKOFF STREET VENDOR TRILOGY. WE WENT THERE. A LIGHT FRIGHTENING.
IRAN IS SAYING, LOOK, IT'S OKAY BEGUN EVERYBODY RELAX  BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET RADIO ISOTOPES BY ENRICHING THIS URANIUM BECAUSE THERE ARE  800,000 CANCER PATIENTS WHO NEED IT.
Jon: SORIC I THOUGHT YOU WERE BUILDING A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS FOR MEDICAL REASONS. MAYBE YOUR PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE SUCH A HIGH CANCER RATE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TIME  ENRICHING URANIUM. CAN A BROTHER GET A HAZMAT SUIT? ARE YOU TOURING A NUCLEAR PLANT OR FILLING MY XANAX PRESCRIPTION AT RITE AID? YOU'RE IN A -- ALL RIGHT. LET'S TO TAKE IRAN AT ITS WORLD IT'S NOT A HOSTILE ACT TO ENRICH IT WE'RE COOL.
THEY ARE THREATENING TO BLOCK THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ.
A FIFTH OF THE WORL'S WATER PASSES THROUGH THERE.
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT WATERWAY ON THE PLANET.
Jon: I KNOW THE BERING STRAIT IS RIGHT NOW LIKE OH, NO YOU DIDN'T. AND THE SUEZ CANAL IS WHAT LIKE AM I CHOPPED LIVER? PANAMA CALL NAL IS LIKE WHAT? IF YOU LIKE THIS YOU'LL LOVE THE CD COLLECTION STEWART ANTHROPOMORPHIZES THE WORLD'S  WATER WAYS. ERIE CANAL WHAT IS -- I'LL GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO MAKE THE CALL. [ LAUGHTER ] WHERE WAS I? ALL RIGHT THE GATHERING CLOUDS OF WAR. WHAT SUP IRAN? I THOUGHT WE WERE TRYING TO BE COOL? SEEMS LIKE THE PERSIAN GULF MILITARY PRESENCE IS HOOKING YOU UP SWEETLY.
THE U.S. COAST GUARD COMING TO THE RESCUE OF AN AN RAYAN SHIP IN THE GULF STRANDED.
Jon: THAT'S AFTER THE U.S. RESCUING IRANIAN FISHERMEN FROM SOMALI PIRATES. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO US, IRAN?
IRAN SENTENCES AN AMERICAN TO DEATH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO US?
IRAN CLAIMS HE WAS SENT BY THE C.I.A. CONTINUE TO FILTRATE  THAT COUNTRY'S INTELLIGENCE AND DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY. HIS FAMILY SAID HE WAS VISITING GRANDPARENTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SPIES SPENT TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY GOING TO GRANDMAS. I THINK I KNOW WHERE THIS IS HEADED. TO HOLLYWOOD, THE SPY WHO LOVED HIS BUBBY? NO, OCTOGENARIAN? NO THE HUNT FOR RED HEART CANDY? [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT SURE YOU DESERVE ANOTHER -- ALL RIGHT FINE. THREE DAYS IN THE CONDO. [ LAUGHTER ] I SEE WE WASTED OUR AFTERNOON. [ LAUGHTER ] IRAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHY ARE YOU POKING AT US? YOU KNOW IRAN MEET ME AT CAMERA THREE. WHAT SUP, IRAN? I KNOW IT'S FUN TO ANNOY US, PULL ON THE GREAT SATAN'S BEARD. YOU DO REALIZE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO WOULD LIKE TO BOMB YOU. HAVE YOU PAID ATTENTION TO YOUR REGION'S HISTORY IN THE PAST TEN YEARS OR SO? DO YOU WANT US TO BOMB YOU? DID YOU LOOK AT IRAQ AND THINK, HOW DO WE GET IN ON THAT SNAKS WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY WORKING ROADS AND EREKD BUILDINGS. I HEAR THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE RUBBLE BUSINESS. LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT SINCE OUR MANUFACTURING BASE DEPARTED IN THE 70s, BOMBING (bleep) IN THE DESERT IS KIND OF OUR THING NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW IN THE UNITED STATES OUR CHIEF EXPORT IS BOOMS! AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T PLAY.
DO NOT DEVELOP A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THAT'S A RED LINE FOR US.
Jon: YOU DO NOT WANT TO CROSS ONE OF OUR RED LINES. WE LAY ONE RED LINE DOWN IT'S UNCROSSABLE.
THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT TOLERATE THE BLOCKING OF THE STRAITS OF HORMUZ. THAT'S ANOTHER RED LINE FOR US.
Jon: OKAY TWO. YOU GET TWO RED LINES. ONE MORE AND WE'LL DRAW A BLUE CIRCLE AROUND YOU SO FAST. I'LL GRANT YOU THAT THEY ARE NOT GREAT WITH THE TOUGH TALK BUT HE MIGHT NOT BE AROUND FOR MUCH LONGER. THERE'S AN ELECTION GOING ON HERE. YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT LIKE YOU, WE DON'T KEEP THESE GUYS FOREVER. AND THE GUYS WHO ARE LOOKING TO TAKE OBAMA'S PLACE, THEY ARE NOT ALL COOL BLACK GUYS WHO SMOKE  CIGARETTE AND DRAW LINES.
IRAN MUST NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND WE'LL GO ABOUT WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE  IT HAPPENS.
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS WILLING IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS  IF NECESSARY TO KEEP THEM FRYING A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
WE COULD BREAK THE REGIME WITHIN A YEAR.
I WOULD SEND TROOPS BACK INTO IRAQ.
Jon: THAT'S HOW CRAZY THESE (bleep) GUYS ARE. THEY'LL BOOM BOMB YOU, THE COUNTRY WE GOT OUT OF. IF THERE'S AN IRA WE'RE BOMBING IT. WE DON'T CARE WHAT LETTER IT END THES WITH! THIS IS HOW MUCH THE NEW GUYS HATE THE IDEA OF YOU DEVELOPING NUKES.
THERE'S SCIENTISTS TURN UP DEAD IN RUSSIA AND IRAN. THERE'S BEEN COMPUTER VIRUSES, PROBLEMS AT THEIR FACILITY. THE HOPE THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH THAT.
Jon: DID YOU SEE THAT? THAT IS A CANDIDATE FOR A MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY EXPRESSING HIS HOPE THAT WE'RE SECRETLY  MURDERING YOUR SCIENTISTS. BY THE WAY, THAT DUDE SANTORUM THAT IS WHAT WE CALL IN THIS COUNTRY PROLIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE ONLY GUY WHOP -- WHO WON'T BOMB YOU IS RON PAUL AND BELIEVE THEY ME THEY ARE GOING TO DO  EVERYTHING THEY CANNOT TO LET THAT GUY WIN. IRAN KEEP THIS US, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF OBAMA HAS TO BOMB  YOU HIMSELF TO KEEP THESE OTHER GUYS FROM CALLING HIM CHICKEN (bleep). AMERICANS DON'T HATE YOU AND I HOPE IRANIANS DON'T WANT US BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT A WAR  (bleep) WITH AMERICA DURING ELECTION SEASON. GET IN BETWEEN SEVEN POWERFUL MEN AND HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE AN OFFICER WITH NO CORNERS AND  POWER TO 24 HOURS A DAY PICK  YOU PHONE AND ANY (bleep) SAND WIHCH THEY WANT. THERE ISN'T ANY O
