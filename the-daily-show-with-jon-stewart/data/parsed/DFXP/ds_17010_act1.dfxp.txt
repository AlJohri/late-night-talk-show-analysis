HE IS AN AUTHOR OF NEW BIOGRAPHY OF STEVE JOBS WHICH LIKE ALL THINGS APPLE YOU CAN GET A YEAR  FROM NOW AND IT WILL WEIGH HALF AS MUCH AS IT WEIGHS NOW AND IT WILL COST 30% LESS. [ LAUGHTER ] THE GUEST INTRODUCTION JOKES, REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ] HALF THE TIME I SHOULD BE LIKE (bleep) THERE'S NO GUEST. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF INDECISION 2012  THE GREAT RIGHT HOPE. WE MENTIONED RICK PERRY'S INTRIER IN "PARADE" THE MAGAZINE -- THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ] "PARADE" MAGA SCENE, THE MAGA SCENE MOST PEOPLE MISTAKE FOR COUPONS. [ LAUGHTER ] DOESN'T HE LOOK LIKE HE IS UNDRESSING HIMSELF WITH HIS EYES? DOESN'T IT LOOK LIKE HE'S LOOKING IN THE MIRROR GOING, "YEAH I'D (bleep) ME." HE GET IN TROUBLE FOR IMPLYING  HE WAS NOT 100% SURE THAT BARACK OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS AUTHENTIC. HE EXPLAINED WHAT HE MEANTth I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE. IT'S FUN TO POKE AT HIM SAYING LET'S SEE YOUR GRADES AND YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
Jon: I MEAN, I KID AROUND. ONE TIME WE WERE EXECUTING THIS FELLA AND, I CALLED THAT INFUSION ROOM BEFORE MIDNIGHT  AND I SAID TO THE FELLA AND I SAID WHY DO I CALL IT THE DEATH PENALTY? THE TRUTH IS, YOU ARE GETTING THROWN OUT OF GAME. ANYWAY I FIND OUT LATER THE FELLA WAS MENTALLY DISABLED SO YOU YOU KNOW --  [ LAUGHTER ] SO AH, --  [ LAUGHTER ] SOMEBODY JUST KILLED A DUCK. [ LAUGHTER ] OR THEY TRULY ENJOYED THAT JOKE. SO PICK PERRY WAS JUST HAVING SOME FUN. HE IS NOT THE ONLY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE OUT THERE WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR. HERE IS HERMAN CAIN COMPLAINING WHY HE SAID HE WANTED AN ELECTRIFIED FENCE ACROSS THE  MEXICAN BORDER.
LET ME SAY IT WAS A JOKE. SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK IT WAS A GOOD JOKE. IT'S PROBABLY NOT A JOKE YOU SHOULD MAKE IF YOU ARE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. APOLOGIZE IF YOU OFFENDED ANYONE.
Jon: YOU CAN CATCH MORE OF HIS COMEDY STYLINGS ON THE NEXT TONE DEAF COMEDY JAM. HE APOLOGIZES FOR THE JOKE ABOUT ELECTRIFYING THE FENCE. HE SAID ONE MORE SENTENCE AND THEN SAYS THIS.
I DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR USING A COMBINE COMBINATION OF A FENCE  THAT MIGHT BE ELECTIFIED. I'M NOT WALKING AWAY FROM THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HE PROPOSES POLL SIT SAME WAY A TEENAGE GUY HITS A GIRL. WE SHOULD MAKE OUT.I'M JUST JOKING UNLES WE SHOULD MAKE OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] PERRY'S BIRTHER EMBRACES THE MEXICAN FENCE BUG ZAPPER IDEA. A PATTERN IS EMERGING. SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT IT.
I HAD A MOTHER COME UP TO ME. SHE TOLD ME HER LITTLE DAUGHTER TOOK THAT VACCINE, THAT INJECTION AND SHE SUFFERED FROM  MENTAL RETARDATION THEREAFTER.
THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE MORE TO DESTROY THE BONDS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES  THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN OUR HISTORY.
IT'S CALLED THE LIBERTY AMENDMENT.
IT GETS RID OF THE 16th AMENDMENT, THE IRS.
PEOPLE ON SOCIAL SECURITY TODAY IT'S A PONZI SCHEME.
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, MY FRIEND.
IF YOU WANT TO PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL START WITH BARNEY FRANK AND CHRIS DODD. >>LY BUILD A DOUBLE-WALLED FENCE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DID YOU SPOT THE TREND AMONGST THE REPUBLICANS? I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT:  THEY ARE ALL SAYING CRAZY THINGS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU MAY SAY TO YOUR SFERBLG BY, JON, ANYTHING THEY SAY THAT ISN'T DIRECTLY TRANSCRIBED FROM THE TATTOOED TAINT FROM CHE  GUEVARRA WOULDN'T SATISFY YOU YOU LEFT COAST JEWISH-ISH AVOWED READER OF PEOPLE'S PAINT. THAT'S FAIR. THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT MUST BE WORRIED HERE. EVEN A GEORGE WILL OR THEIR EFFECT LUCKETT YOU'LL EQUIVALENT.
THOSE PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY GOT TO LAY OFF THIS STUFF. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT PAT, GAY PEOPLE CAUSE HURRICANES ROBERTSON, EXPRESSING CONCERN FOR HOW EXTREME THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS GOTTEN?
THEY ARE FORCING THEIR LEADERS, THE FRONT RUNNERS INTO POSITIONS THAT WILL MEAN THEY  LOSE THE GENERAL ELECTION.
Jon: PAT, LIBERALS ARE ADOWN NAZIS ROBERTSON BELIEVES 9 REPUBLICANS ARE STAKING OUT A  POSITION THAT MAY BE UNAPPEALINGLY EXTREME? THIS GUY?
IF WE TAKE STANDARDS AWAY IN HOMOSEXUALITY WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS? WHAT ABOUT BESTIALITY AND ULTIMATELY WHAT ABOUT THE CHILD MOLESTATION AND PEDOPHILIA?
Jon: THAT GUY. THAT GUY WHOSE MIND SEES GAY MARRIAGE, BESTIALITY AND PEDOPHILIA AND DRAWS AN EQUAL  SIGN BETWEEN THEM. THAT GUY, PAT THE 2010 HAITIAN EARTHQUAKE WAS CAUSED BY A DEAL HAITIANS MADE WITH THE DEVIL#Gï¿½ TO  GAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE FROM FRANCE ROBERTSON. THAT GUY. DID HE SAY THAT, BY THE WAY. LISTEN TO THIS.
THEY GOT TOGETHER AND SWORE A PACT TO THE DEVIL. THEY SAID, WE WILL SERVE YOU IF YOU'LL GET US FREE FROM THE PRINCE. TRUE STORY.
Jon: YEAH, TRUE STORY. A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN TOLD ME IT WAS HAITI AND THE DEVIL AND THE DEVIL WAS LIKE ALL RIGHT BUT IN  RETURN I'LL (bleep) YOUR COUNTRY UP REAL BAD AND THEY WERE LIKE, OKAY, WHATEVER. PAT ROBERTSON, THAT GUY, IS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE RHETORIC HE HAS HEARD FROM REPUBLICANS  RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT GUY.
KWANZAA IS A FRAUD. HALLOWEEN IS SATAN'S NIGHT. THE NIGHT FOR THE DEVIL. ISLAMIC PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DEMAND FOOT WASHING AT AIRPORTS. EL HOMOSEXUALS WANT TO DESTROY THE CHURCH AND MARRIAGE. YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS REALLY WEIRD. HIS SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS HE LIKES TO HAVE SEX WITH DUCKS. IS HE PROTECTED UNDER HATE CRIME?
Jon: FIRST OF ALL. IT'S CALLED A TU, (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] SECOND OF ALL. IF THE SEX WITH THE DUCK IS CONSENSUAL, THEN I WOULD SAY YES, HE IS PROTECTED. PAT ROBERTSON, THE GUY WHO SAID ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE SHOWED YOU IS TELLING REPUBLICANS TONE  IT DOWN. IT WOULD BE LIKE FACEBOOK SAYING TO YOU, TMI. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S INTERNET LINGO FOR TOO MUCH INFORMATION. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY. THE QUESTION BECOMES WHY? WHY IS PAT ROBERTSON,sK!zAKA, THAT CRAZY (bleep) GUY, TELLING REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATES TO MODERATE THEIR RHETORIC.
I BELIEVE IT WAS LYNDON JOHNSON THAT SAID DON'T THESE PEOPLE REALIZE IF THEY PUSH ME  TO AN EXTREME POSITION I'LL LOSE THE ELECTION. THEY'LL MAKE IT SO I CAN'T WIN. THEY HAVE TO STOP THIS. IT'S COUNTER PRODUCTIVE.
Jon: NOT THAT THE THINGS YOU ARE SAYING ARE WRONG OR BAD POLICY OR CALLUS OR CRAZY, BUT  THAT YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT LET'S KEEP IT OUR LITTLE SECRET. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT HE IS TELLING THE G.O.P. FIELD IS THIS:  IF YOU TELL PEOPLE WHAT WE HONESTLY BELIEVE, AN ELECTORAL MAJORITY OF OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL FREAK THE (bleep) OUT. HE IS SAYING THE FIRST RULE OF RIGHT CLUB, DON'T TALK ABOUT RIGHT CLUB. [ LAUGHTER ] BY THE WAY --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- I WANT TO MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE SECOND RULE OF RIGHT CLUB, MAKE SURE THE DUCK CONSENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [ LAUGHTER ]
