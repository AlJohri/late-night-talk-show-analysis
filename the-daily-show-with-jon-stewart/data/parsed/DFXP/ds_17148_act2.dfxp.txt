WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. IF I MAY, TOLERANCE, IT'S ONE OF THE BASIC TENANTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. BUT IS THERE TRULY ROOM FOR EVERYONE UNDER THE D.N.C.'S BIG TENT? THE BEST (BLEEP)ING NEWS TEAM HAS MORE.
THERE'S ONE KEY MESSAGE AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION THAT'S NOT IN DISPUTE.
WE ARE THE BIG TENT PARTY. WE REPRESENT EVERYONE.
WE'RE DEFINITELY THE ARMS WIDE OPEN PARTY.
WE'RE THE PARTY OF INCLUSION.
WE HAVE JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE IN THE PARTY.
YES, THEY WERE OPEN TO EVERYBODY.
BASICALLY LATINOS, HISPANICS, BLACK, THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY, WOMEN.
EVERYONE'S WELCOME.
EVERYONE'S WELCOME.
EXCEPT...
EXCEPT UNLESS YOU OWN A CORPORATION OR IF YOU'RE A HUNTER, A GUN OWNER, WHITE MALES.
REALLY, YOU WANT TO LOSE ALL THE WHITE MALES?
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF GUN TOTING HILLBILLY TEA PARTIERS. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. BANG, BANG, BANG.
BUNCH OF JERKOFFS, RIGHT?
DEFINITELY.
HOW OPEN ARE YOU?
WELL, OPEN ENOUGH TO INCLUDE EVERYBODY.
OH, REALLY. WHO WOULDN'T YOU INCLUDE?
THOSE BEER TOTING FAKEERS DOWN IN FLORIDA. THE TAMPA CONVENTION GUYS.
YOU KNOW THE TYPES.
POT BELLIES.
CHURCHGOING.
SMALL MINDED.
ANTISCIENCE.
YOSEMITE SAM HILLBILLIES.
WHACK JOBS, EVANGELICALS, GUN NUTS.
THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR A MESSAGE OF DIFFERENCE AND HOPE.
WHAT CAN YOU AND I TEACH THESE WHACK JOBS ABOUT INCLUSION? YOU GO FIRST.
YOU CAN'T TEACH THEM ANYTHING.
DON'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT SCIENCE. VERY QUESTIONABLE ON ANY KIND OF THOUGHT THAT INVOLVES MORE THAN TWO OR THREE SENTENCES. (LAUGHTER)
WE ARE THE BIG TENT PARTY AND WE WILL LET MOST ANYBODY IN UNLESS, OF COURSE THEY'RE  CARRYING GUNS.
RIGHT, WHO NEEDS THAT 146 MILLION PEOPLE IN YOUR PARTY?
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WE DON'T STEREOTYPE OR GENERALIZE.
THE TEA BAGGERS GENERALIZE.
THIS HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY THE PARTY OF TOLERANCE.
THE TEA BAGGERS ARE THE LEAST TOLERANT GROUP I HAVE EVER SEEN. CAN.
ARE YOU SAYING THEY'RE MORE DISCIPLINED.
EVIL. EVEN BEFORE IT WAS APPROPRIATE, ACTUALLY.
THESE CHRISTIAN EVANGELICALS DON'T GET IT BECAUSE I DON'T  BELIEVE THEY EVER ACTUALLY READ THE BIBLE.
I HAVE A FEELING THEY HAVE READ IT.
WELL, POSSIBLY BUT DIDN'T...
NO, MORE THAN POSSIBLY.
THIS IS SO INCLUSIVE. YOU KNOW, WE EVEN INVITE THE REDNECK FREAKS IN. (LAUGHTER)
WE DON'T JUDGE.
WHAT DON'T THEY GET ABOUT TOLERANCE?
I WOULD NEVER CALL A REDNECK A NAME. (LAUGHTER)
I DON'T KNOW. I'M THINKING LIKE A COUPLE OF TEETH, YOU KNOW? HAIR OUT OF PLACE. MAYBE A NICE GUT.
LOOK WHOO!
YEAH.
HEY, WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN TO TAMPA AND WE'RE GONNA THROUGH A  BIG PARTY AND I'M GONNA PUT ON MY CLEAN T-SHIRT AND BRUSH MY TOOTH! LET'S GO! POW, POW! DO IT!
POW, POW!
THE WORLD WOULD BE VERY BEAUTIFUL IF WE COULD JUST ACCEPT EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENCES.
EXACTLY.  ACCEPT EVERYONE'S DIFFERENCES.
UH-HUH.
EVERYONE'S DIFFERENCES.
YES.
WE NEED TO ACCEPT EVERYONE.
YOU MEAN I SHOULD ACCEPT THEM? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THANK YOU, SAM
