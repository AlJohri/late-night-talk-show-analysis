MY NAME IS JON STEWART. NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR JOIN US. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THIS IS AN INTERESTING FACT I JUST FOUND OUT-- MY NAME IS ARABIC... ( LAUGHTER ) MEANS-- MEANS-- OH, KNOWLEDGEABLE ONE. BUT MY NAME IN ARABIC SLANG MEANS "THE TAINT OF A CAMEL." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT. ANYWAY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS CALL POLICEMENNENS AUTHOR OF THE BOOK OF THE CLOSING OUT OF AN  AMERICAN AUTO PLANT. YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHERE THE PLANT IS GOING. I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT, TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM COMING HERE AND  TAKING OUR JOBS WE'RE APPARENTLY SENDING OUR JOBS DIRECTLY TO THEM. I TURN ON THE TV THIS MORNING AND CAUGHT THE "TODAY" SHOW, GLENN BECK MAKING AN APPEARANCE TO PROMOTE HIS NEW BOOK AND THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE THAT  CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.
THIS IS WHERE THE CRITICS COME UP INTO PLAY SAYING YOU ADDED INTO THIS DIALOGUE OF HATRED. THE PRESIDENT IS A RACIST. YOU SAID JOKINGAND YOU WANTED TO POISON NANCY PELOSI. YOU WANTED TO BEAT CONGRESSMAN CHARLIE RANGEL TO DEATH WITH A SHOVEL. IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS BOOK, DO YOU REGRET THAT STUFF NOW?
ANYTHING I SAID IN JOKES, NO. ASK JON STEWART. ASK "THE SIMPSONS."
Jon:  HUH? I THINK GLENN BECK THINKS I'M A CARTOON CHARACTER ( LAUGHTER )  GLENN, HERE'S THE THING, MY MAN-- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL MEREDITH VIERA TO ASK ME. ASK ME YOURSELF. ( LAUGHTER ) ONCE AGAIN, MY BROTHER. YOU, MY FRIEND, AND I-- HOLD ON. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I THOUGHT WE WERE CHANGING THAT TITLE. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M JUST-- ( APPLAUSE ) BUT MY MESSAGE-- MY MESSAGE IS  THE SAME-- GLENN BECK, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE ON OUR SHOW, BY WHICH I MEAN APPEAR ON MY SHOW, SO YOU CAN GET IS THIS THINGS OFF YOUR CHEST. YOU CAN-- NO, NO. THAT'S-- THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT TO-- ( APPLAUSE ) I'D LIKE TO-- JUST LOSE THE  LOWER 30. I'LL SWEETEN THE DEAL, BROTHER MAN. I'VE GOT A PRESENT FOR YOU. I LOVE YOU LOVE THE TEACHIN. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S ONE OF THEM FIVE-PRONGED COLORED CHALK THINGS. YOU COULD USE IT ON YOUR BOARD TO DO ALL THE STUFF YOU DO. IMAGINE, YOU COULD GET FIVE PEOPLE CONNECTED TO GEORGE SOROSE. ( LAUGHTER ) TELL ME IF YOU'LL COME UP BECAUSE I DO HAVE TO GIVE THIS BACK TO MY DAUGHTER. SERIOUSLY, I'LL ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS. WE'LL GET TO KNOW EACH ORG MY NEW SEGMENT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. ( CHEERS ) MOVING ON TO-- COME ON! IT WILL BE GREAT EXPLOITATIVE TELEVISION. MOVING ON TO HEAVIER, WEIGHTIER MATTERS. HAITI HAS BEEN STRUGGLING AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE, AND A CHOLERA EPIDEMIC. NOT TO WORRY. HELP IS ON THE WAY.
THE MAN KNOWN AS BABY DOC JEAN CLAUDE DUVALIER IS BACK IN HAITI.
HIS POLICE FORCE SILENCED OPPONENTS WITH MACHETES OR GUNS.
Jon:  HONEY, I'M HONE! WHAT MAKES BABY DOC JEAN CLAUDE DUVALIER THINK HE CAN GO BACK TO HAITI NOW? I GUESS HE LOOKS AT THE CONDITIONS AND THINKS, HUH? WHO HAS TWO THUMBS AND IS BETTER THAN CHOLERA AND FAMINE? IT'S THIS GUY! SO HOW WAS THE DOC? YOU AT LEAST WANT TO SEE, OTHER THAN SAY DOOM OUR AUK, RECEIVED IN HIS NATIVE COUNTRY? I BET THEY ARRESTED THAT FELLOW RIGHT QUICK.
BABY DOC IS FACING CHARGES. HE WAS ALLOWED TO RETURN TO HIS HOTEL TUESDAY AFTER BEING ESCORTED TO A PORT-AU-PRINCE  COURTHOUSE PER A HEARING.
Jon:  WOW DICTATOR BACK TO HIS HOTEL. THAT'S A PUNISHMENT MANY HAITIANS WOULD REFER TO AS THE GREATEST DAY OF THEIR LIVES. AS ONE TRIES TO WORM HIS WAY INTAK INTO PEOPLE'S HEARTS, ANOTHER BIDS ADIEU.
AFTER VIOLENT PROTESTS IN TUNISIA, THE TUNISIAN GOVERNMENT HAS FALLEN.
Jon:  THE UNREST GIVES HOPE FOR THOSE IN THE REGION PROTESTING FOR MORE DEMOCRATIC  GOVERNMENT AND YET CAUSES SADNESS FOR MANY OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAD BEEN  MAYBE HOPE TO VISIT THE TUNISIAN DESERT WHERE STIFFEN SPIELBERG FILMED. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO FOR SPRING BREAK? GO TO NEW ZEALAND AGAIN? YES, YES, THIS IS THE HOUSE GEORGE ASTTON SLEPT IN ( LAUGHTER ) BEN ALI RULED TUNISIA FOR 23  YEARS AND HIS OUSTER THROUGH PROTEST, TOOK OBSERVERS OFF GUARD AS TUNISIA IS CONSIDERED  THE MORE MODERATE NATION IN THE REGION, PROTESTERS OFTEN EXPRESSING THEIR DISPLEASURE BY  WASHING THEIR LEADER IN EFFIGY. ( LAUGHTER ) DEATH TO TYRANTS! ( LAUGHTER ) IN JUST ONE 24-HOUR PERIOD, TUNISIA HAD THREE LEADERS. BEN ALI WAS REPLACED AND HE WAS THEN OVERTHROWN BY THE HEAD OF TUNISIA'S LOWER HOUSE OF  PARLIAMENT, THANKS IN PART TO THIS DEVASTATING CAMPAIGN AD RELEASED.
HE SAYS HE'S PROUD OF THE JOB HE'S DOING AS TUNISIA'S  PRESIDENT, BUT ASK YOURSELF-- ARE YOU BETTER OFF NOW THAN YOU WERE THREE HOWARD AGO?
HI, I'M FAUDE MUBAZA, AND I LOOK AT THE HOURS OF 1:00 TO  4:00 P.M. AND THINK TUNISIA CAN DO BETTER. SO ONCE YOU'RE DONE WRITING, WHY NOT INSTALL ME, FAUDE MUBAZA AS YOUR NEW PRESIDENT. PLEASE DON'T RISE UP AND OVERTHROW ME.
Jon:  OF COURSE, TUNISIA HAS AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AS HIGH AS 40% IN SOME REGIONS, HAS  LIVED UNDER A CORRUPT AUTO CRACKIC REGIME, RAISING THE QUESTION, COULD IT HAPPEN HERE?
PROTEST BREAKING OUT IN TUNISIA. TUNISIA. PROTESTS BLAMED IN PART ON THINGS LIKE FOOD PRICES. THINGS ARE GETTING SO BAD THE PRESIDENT OF TUNISIA FLED THE COUNTRY. ALL OF THISES IS AMERICANS ARE STARTING TO GET A DOSE OF BOOSTED INFLATION HERE, AS WELL. MEAT AND POALT AND FISH ARE UP 5% FROM A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, DAIRY PRODUCTS UP 4%, SUGARS AND SWEETS UP TWO%. WE ARE SEEING OUTBREAKS OF THIS SAME SORT OF THING ON SPIKES AND IN KEY STAPLES THAT GET PEOPLE UN-STAPLE.
Jon:  THERE'S A PICTURE OF A GUY SHOOTING TEAR GAS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ( LAUGHTER ) I'M NOT SAYING HE HAS NO FAITH IN OUR COUNTRY BUT HE DID SAY  PEOPLE ARE POSSIBLY GOING TO OVERTHROW THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT BECAUSE CLARK BARS WENT UP A NICKEL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
