IF YOU AT HOME ARE ANYTHING LIKE OUR STUDIO AUDIENCE, YOU SAT THROUGH OUR FIRST ACT WONDERING, WHY DIDN'T YOU MENTION THE LATEST DETAILS ON THE ANTHONY WEINER SEXTING CANDLE. THE ANSWER IS WE CAN'T DO IT EVERY ACT OF EVERY SHOW. WE NEED A FEW MINUTES TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE. YOU KNOW, BEFORE. [LAUGHTER] [BLEEPED]-GATE WAITS FOR NO MAN. AT THIS POINT THE WIG QUESTION IS, HOW WILL THE CONGRESSMAN'S CONSTITUENTS IN BROOKLYN AND  QUEENS REACT TO THE SCANDAL.
THE RULES OF THE APARTMENT BUILDING.
SURE, OF COURSE.
ANTHONY, GO IN, GO IN, TELL 'EM TO LEAVE YOU ALONE. GO INSIDE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WE HAVE OUR ANSWER. THEY WILL REACT LIKE STEREOTYPICAL ELDERLY DENIZENS OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS. [AS A WOMAN:] ANTHONY, GO BACK INSIDE. IF YOU GO OUT LATE, WEAR A LIGHT JACKET. YOU NEVER KNOW. YOU'RE SKIN AND BONES. THIS DAMN THING JUST KEEPS GETTING CRAZIER. PERHAPS NO, SIR INDICATOR... I KNOW. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? [BLEEPED] DAY FIVE AN WE STILL GOT THESE HANGING AROUND. PERHAPS NO INDICATOR OF ITS MAGNITUDE MORE TELLING OF THE WEIRDNESS THAN THIS.
ACCORDING TO TO IT WILL CO, WEINER CALLED BILL CLINTON AND APOLOGIZED.
Jon: WHAT! [LAUGHTER] THE CONGRESSMAN HAD A SEX SCANDAL AND HAD TO APOLOGIZE TO BILL CLINTON? FOR WHAT, COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A FACT VIOLATION. THAT IS INSANE. I CAN HEAR THE BIG DOG TAKING THE CALL. ANTHONY I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED. NOW THIS TWITTER THING, CAN ANYBODY SIGN UP FOR IT OR DO I NEED TO GO TO THE APPLE GENIUS BAR? [LAUGHTER] AT LEAST THE CONGRESSMAN HAS NOT HAD TO SUFFER THE INDIGNITY OF NEWSCASTERS READING ALLOWED THE  TRANSCRIPTS OF HIS TAWDRY CORRESPONDENTS.
THERE HAVE BEEN NEW MESSAGES THAT HAVE BEEN REVEALED BETWEEN  CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY WEINER AND A NEVADA BLACKJACK DEALER. HERE'S SOME OF THOSE TAWDRY TEXTS THAT WERE GOING BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM.
Jon: UNTIL NOW.
HEY, SEXY, SORRY I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER SO LONG. SO WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
THAT'S RIGHT OUT OF MY PLAYBOOK. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BY THE WAY, HIS PLAYBOOK IS SO LAME, THAT'S A LINE HE USES ON WOMEN IN PERSON. SO... WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? UH, IT'S MY WENDY'S UNIFORM.
NICE.
Jon: KILMEADE LIKEY. ONE OF THE NEWLY RELEASED TEXTS DID CATCH MY EYE, IF I MAY, ANTHONY WEINER: MARK ME AN OFFER I CAN'T REFUSE. LADY IN QUESTION: TO GET US IN THE MOOD, FIRST WE WATCH BACK-TO-BACK EPISODES OF "THE  DAILY SHOW" AND "THE COLBERT REPORT."  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT MOOD ARE THEY GOING TO GET INTO? [LAUGHTER] UNFORTUNATELY THEY CONTINUED. "OR IF THIS IS NOT YOUR THING, WE CAN JUST GET DRUNK AND HAVE MAD, PASSIONATE SEX." WEINER, "WHY CHOOSE. WITH ME BEHIND YOU, CAN'T WE BOTH WATCH "THE DAILY SHOW"?"  [AUDIENCE REACTS] YOU WANT ME TO CUT MY WRISTS AGAIN? FIRST OF ALL... [LAUGHTER] IS THIS WHAT YOU PEOPLE ARE DOING AT HOME WHEN OUR SHOW IS ON? I MEAN, WE SPEND ALL DAY WRITING AND PRODUCING THIS THING. IF IT'S JUST GOING TO BE BACKGROUND NOISE FOR YOUR AMOROUS... ARE YOU PEOPLE  [BLEEPED] RIGHT NOW? ARE YOU DOING IT RIGHT NOW? IS IT... [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CHUCK, HEY, CHUCK, HIT THE BUTTON THAT LETS ME SEE THEM. OH, MY GOD! IS THAT WHAT YOU PEOPLE WANT? FINE. I'M NOT GOING TO FIGHT YOU. CHUCK... [JAZZY MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] ARE YOU DONE? AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO GET UP AND GET A SNACK, PUT A TOWEL ON. ANYWAY, FACEBOOK RECORDS REVEAL THAT... [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YEAH. ONE OF OUR CAMERAMEN. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S WHY MOST SHOWS I'M JUST DOING THIS. ANYWAY, FACEBOOK RECORDS REVEAL THAT THE TEXT EXCHANGE ABOUT HAVING SEX WHILE WATCHING OUR  SHOW TOOK PLACE ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2010, A FRIDAY. SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN WATCHING A RERUN OF THURSDAY'S SHOW IF THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE  SEX DURING IT. WHO WAS THE GUEST THAT NIGHT? PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
