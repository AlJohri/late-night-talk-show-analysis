Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT LATELY ABOUT THE POOR. WHAT KIND OF A SCAM ARE THEY RUNNING ON THEM? HOW CAN WE LET THEM KNOW THAT THIS INCREDIBLY WATERED DOWN GRAPHY TRAIN IS COMING TO AN END. THE ANSWER AS ALWAYS IS IN FLORIDA. AASIF MANDVI HAS MORE.
Reporter: POOR PEOPLE, THEY SPEND THEIR DAYS PROTECTED. LUXOR YATING IN THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET, BUT WHO WILL PROTECT US FROM THESE DRUG ADELED MOOCHERS. FORTUNATELY SOME COURAGEOUS POLITICIANS IN FLORIDA HAVE ANSWERED THE CALL.
FLORIDA GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT JUST SIGNED A LAW THAT WELFARE RECIPIENTS SHOULD  GET DRUG TESTS BEFORE THEY GET THEIR HANDS ON THAT TAXPAYER FUNDED WELFARE CHECK.
THE STUDIES SHOW THAT PEOPLE ON WELFARE ARE USING DRUGS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE POPULATION.
Reporter: AND THAT DAMNING EVIDENCE HELPED THE LAW PASS BY A 2-1 MARGIN. WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF PEOPLE LIKE REPRESENTATIVES SCOTT PLAQUEIN.
I THINK IN ANY LAW THAT WE PASS THE FIRST THING SHOULD BE DO NO HARM, BY  GIVING CASH TO SOMEBODY THAT HAS A DRUG HABIT, WE'RE DOING HARM.
Reporter: WE KNOW HOW MUCH POOR PEOPLE LOVE DRUGS.
WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT POOR PEOPLE LOVE DRUGS, AASIF. BUT IF WE ARE GIVING YOU MONEY, WE'RE JUST ASKING YOU TO TAKE THIS TEST.
Reporter: BUT THE INSINUATION BY LEGISLATORS THAT ALL POOR PEOPLE ARE ON  DRUGS DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH SOME.
I REFUSE TO TAKE THE DRUG TEST. IT IS CASTING A CLOUD OVER A POPULATION OF PEOPLE WITH NO FACTUAL EVIDENCE.
Reporter: YOU SOUND LIKE SOMEBODY WHO IS ON DRUGS.
NO, I'M NOT ON DRUGS.
Reporter: CAN YOU PROVE IT? HERE. PEE IN THE CUP.
NO. IF SOMEONE DOESN'T SHOW BACKUP FOR A DRUG TEST THE EQUATION WOULD BE SIMPLE. THEY'RE CHOOSING THEIR DRUGS OVER CHOOSING TO GET THAT MONEY FOR THEIR CHILDREN.
Reporter: SO YOUR DRUG HABIT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR FAMILY.
NO, MY FAMILY IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND I'M A FATHER, TAKING CARE OF MY DISABLED MOTHER AND I'M STUDYING TO BE AN ACCOUNTANT.
Reporter: SO AFTER YOU PAY FOR YOUR CHILD'S FOOD, TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOTHER, BUY SCHOOL BOOKS, HOW MUCH MONEY IS LEFT OVER FOR DRUGS?
I DONE DO DRUGS.
Reporter: HE CAN DENY HIS HABIT, BUT NOT THE SUCCESS OF THE WELFARE DRUG TESTING PROGRAM.
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE FAILED.
IT'S SOMETHING LIKE 2%.
Reporter: ONLY 2% OF THE PEOPLE ARE PASSING.
2% OF THE PEOPLE ARE FAILING THE DRUG TEST.
Reporter: WAIT A MINUTE. RICK SCOTT SAID THAT WELFARE RECIPIENTS USE DRUGS AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. MAYBE HE WAS HIGH WHEN HE SAID THAT.
THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS THEY HAVE TO PAY THE APPROXIMATELY $30 FOR THE  DRUG TEST UP FRONT.
Reporter: WHOA. YOU MEAN THE POOR PEOPLE PAY THE $30 FIRST.
THAT'S CORRECT RTED.
AND THEN THE STATE OF FLORIDA REIMBURSES THEM IF THEY PASS THE DRUG TEST.
Reporter: AND HUMILIATION FOR THE 98% THAT PASSED IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR A  PROGRAM THAT IS SAVED FLORIDIANS NEGATIVE $200,000. BUT SOME CAN'T BE BOTHERED WITH STATISTICS.
THIS LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VIOLATES THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.
Reporter: ARE YOU POOR AND ON DRUGS. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION?
I WAS IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY.
YOU'RE A VETERAN.
YES, I TACK AN OATH TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION.
ANY CITIZEN WHETHER A VETERAN OR NOT SHOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE THE DRUG TEST, AS A VETERAN, I WOULD THINK THAT HE WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FREEDOM OF THE TAXPAYERS. THE TAXPAYERS THAT ARE WORKING DAY AND NIGHT, SOMETIMES TWO AND THREE JOBS, AND HE WON'T EVEN DO THIS VERY SIMPLE THING TO HELP HIS FAMILY.
I JUST DON'T GET THAT.
SO WHO PAYS YOUR SALARY.
THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA.
I'M SORRY, I THINK I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO PEE INTO THIS CUP. (APPLAUSE)
I'M NOT GOING TO SUBMIT TO A DRUG TEST BECAUSE AASIF HAS ONE IN MY OFFICE.
Reporter: THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO SAID ANYBODY WHO IS RECEIVING HARDWORKING  FLORIDIAN TAXPAYERS' MONEY SHOULD SUBMIT TO A DRUG TEST. AND I BELIEVE THAT SOMEBODY WAS REPRESENTATIVE SCOTT PLAKIN.
IF A LAW PASSED REQUIRING LEGISLATORS TO DO T I WOULD BE HAPPY TO.
Reporter: SO WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO BE THE FIRST PERSON TO PUT THAT BILL FORWARD.
WELL, THIS YEAR I HAVE ALL MY BILL SLOTS FILLED. BUT YOU KNOW, WE GET SIX BILL SLOTS. SO IF YOU ASK WHAT IS ON THE HIGH PRIORITY OF MY LIST, THAT'S NOT ONE OF THEM.
Reporter: CAN I SAY THAT YOU BEING DRUG TESTED IS PRIORITY NUMBER SEVEN.
WHAT I AM SAYING IS-- .
Reporter: PRIORITY NUMBER 8.
FROM NOW WITH WHAT IS GOING ON I'M NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT MY BILL SLOTS.
SO I'M GOING TO TO-- GO-- YOURSELF [BLEEP] THAT IS WHAT ARE YOU SAYING.
BUT THIS MOMENT-- TO DIG TAKE DOWN THIS CARTEL I HAD TO GET THE KINGPIN. GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT.
BUT THE MONEY THAT WENT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WERE NOT.
YOU BENEFIT FROM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. SO WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PEE INTO THIS CUP TO PROVE TO FLORIDA TAXPAYERS THAT  ARE YOU NOT ON DRUGS. ARE YOU NOT USING THAT MONEY FOR DRUGS.
I'VE DONE IT PLENTY OF TIMES.
WOULD YOU.
I HAVE DONE IT PLENTY OF TIMES.
WOULD YOU PASS THIS FORWARD TO THE GOVERNOR. WE CAN ALL TURN AROUND.
THERE NO LONGER EXPLANATION.
I HATE TO KEEP HARPING INTO THAT.
EXCUSE ME A SECOND.
WOULD YOU PEE IN THE CUP.
JUST A SECOND, I AM GOING OVER HERE. YOU DON'T GET TO RUN THIS. HERE RTS WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S URINE A FEDERAL JUDGE TEMPORARILY  BLOCKED MANDATORY DRUG TESTING. BUT SOMEONE HAS TO MAKE SURE FLORIDIANS ARE STAYING CLEAN.
YOU KNOW WHO IS PAYING FOR THIS DOG PARK.
NO, SIR.
FLORIDA'S TAXPAYER, THAT'S TRUE. MI GOING TO DOT URINE SAMPLE. I'M ON THE CASE.
