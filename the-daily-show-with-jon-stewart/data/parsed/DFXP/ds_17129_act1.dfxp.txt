FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon:  WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GUEST TONIGHT AUTHOR JOSEPH STIGLITZ, AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK  "THE PRICE OF INEQUALITY," WHICH IS ALSO THE WORST GAME SHOW EVER. ( LAUGHTER ) LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH OUR ELECTION COVERAGE. DEMOCALYPSE 2012. DO WE LOOK STUPID? DON'T ANSWER THAT, EDITION. WE TOUCHED ON THIS A LITTLE BIT LAST NIGHT. THERE'S AN OLD SAYING IN WASHINGTON A GAP IS WHEN A POLITICIAN ACCIDENTALLY TELLS THE TRUTH. RECENTLY, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA MADE A NEW TYPE OF GAFFE WHEN HE TOLD THE TRUTH ON PURPOSE.
IF YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL, SOMEBODY ALONG THE LINE GAVE YOU SOME HELP. THERE WAS A GREAT TEACHER SOMEWHERE IN YOUR LIFE. SOMEBODY HELPED TO CREATE THIS UNBELIEVABLE AMERICAN SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE THAT ALLOWED TO YOU THRIVE. SOMEBODY INVESTED IN ROADS AND BRIDGES.
Jon:  ARGUMENT MADE IN APPARENTLY A COMEDY CLUB OF HECKLERS, THAT YOUR SUCCESS ALSO  OWES SOME DEBT TO THE SYSTEM AND INFRASTRUCTURE CREATED TO SUPPORT YOUR ENDEAVOR. AND THAT'S THE DEBT THAT IT OWES IS WHAT WE CALL TAXES. THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GO BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. PRETTY UNREMARKABLE OBSERVATION ABOUT LIFE IN SOCIETY. HERE'S THE GAFFE.
SOMEBODY INVESTED IN ROADS AND BRIDGES. IF YOU GOT A BUSINESS, YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT. SOMEBODY ELSE MADE THAT WHAT THAT.
Jon:  WHAT! WHOA! WHAT! WHOA! WHAT! WHOA! WHAT! WHOA! NO! DID YOU-- PRESIDENT OBAMA, ARE YOU SAYING PEOPLE WHO BUILT BUSINESSES THEY DIDN'T BUILD  THAT, THAT BUSINESS, THAT-- ARE YOU INEXPLICABLY AND UNPRESIDENTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A  NOW BANAL POPULIST RUN DELIVERING A NUT PUNCH TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS? IS THAT YOUR POINT, SIR?
THE POINT IS, IS THAT WHEN WE SUCCEED, WE SUCCEED BECAUSE OF  OUR INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE, BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE DO THINGS TOGETHER.
Jon:  OH, THAT'S YOUR POINT. ( LAUGHTER ). HMMM. HERE'S A TIP-- WHEN SOMEONE SAYS, "THE POINT IS..." THE NEXT  THING THEY SAY USUALLY, NINE TIMES OUT OF 10, IS THE POINT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I SEE WHAT HAPPENED HERE. BY USING THE PHRASE "YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT," YOU CREATE CONFUSION BY USING THE  DEMONSTRATIVE SINGLE PRONOUN THAT INSTEAD OF THE PLURAL ANAPHASE THOSE, WHICH OF COURSE  WAS REFERRING TO THE ANTECEDENT ROADS AND BRIDGES-- OH, MY BUTT GUST GAVE ITSELF A WEDGY. MY BUTT IS GIVING MYSELF A GRAMMAR WEDGY. WHY WOULD DO THAT! BUT YOU'RE INAN MEAT AND I'M WEARING YOU. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? IT IS TRUE, THOUGH, ESPECIALLY IN POLITICS. NEVER SAY "THAT," BECAUSE THE SINGULAR DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUN POINTS TO A SPECIFIC FINGER. ALWAYS USE THE PLURAL "THOSE." THEN YOU DON'T GET IN TROUBLE. INSTEAD OF SAYING THIS.
I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH THAT WOMAN. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  SEE, THAT SPECIFIC WOMAN-- WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY IS, "I DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH THOSE WOMEN, THOSE WOMEN." THAT-- WAIT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NO, THAT'S-- OKAY. THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE. ( LAUGHTER ). ANYWAY, YOU'D HAVE TO BE A REAL SHYSTER. GIVEN THE SURROUNDING CONTEXT OF OBAMA'S REMARKS, INCLUDING HIS  "THE POINT IS" DISCUSSION, TO MAKE WILLFUL HAY OUT OF THIS WRATH COMMON SINGULAR PLURAL  DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUN-- MY SHIRT IS GIVES ME A NURPLE. WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT? I'M BEING BULLIED BY MY-- I WONDER WHICH WAY THE CONSERVATIVE PUNDITS WENT WITH IT.
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY, "IT'S  NOT YOUR HARD WORK THAT MADE YOU SUCCESSFUL. IT'S THE GOVERNMENT?"
THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND, HE DOES NOT RESPECT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS.
THEN HE TURNS AROUND AND DISMISSES THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM.
MEAN, THIS IS JUST GRADE SCHOOL MARXISM THAT HE'S MUTTERING.
Jon:  YES! ( LAUGHTER ) GRADE SCHOOL MARXISM! OR AS YOUR SECOND GRADE TEACHER MIGHT HAVE REFERRED TO IT, SHARING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) GUYS! HE CLEARLY SAID BEFORE "YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT "HE WAS  TALKING ABOUT BUILDING ROADS AND PRIVILEGES. IT WAS IN THE SPEECH. YOU REALLY WANT TO HANG YOUR ENTIRE CAMPAIGN ON A WILLFUL, OUT-OF-CONTEXT MISUNDERSTANDING?
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OUT THERE. HE'S NOW GOT A POLITICAL AD THAT IS UP IN A NUMBER OF THE SWING  STATES WHERE HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. DON'T BELIEVE WHAT MITT ROMNEY IS SAYING." ALL RIGHT, HERE'S WHAT THE  PRESIDENT SAID THAT GOT HIM INTO TROUBLE WITH THE REPUBLICANS.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, GOOD ON YOU, STEVE DOOCY. I MADE FUN OF YOU IN THE PAST AS BEING A BIT OF A TOOL. ( LAUGHTER ). THROW PILLOW OF MISINFORMATION. DISINGENUOUS MUPPET-SHAPED PROPAGANDA DUDE, MY APOLOGIES. YOU'RE NEW GOING TO PLAY THE UNEDITED VERSION SHOWING THE  LINE IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE "YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT LINE" THE ONES  ABOUT THE ROADS AND BRIDGES SO THANK YOU.
HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT GOT HIM INTO TROUBLE WITH THE REPUBLICANS.
IF YOU'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL, YOU DIDN'T GET THERE ON YOUR OWN. YOU DIDN'T GET THERE ON YOUR OWN. I'M ALWAYS STRUCK BY PEOPLE WHO THINK, WOW, IT MUST BE BECAUSE I WAS JUST SO SMART. THERE ARE A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE OUT THERE. IT MUST BE BECAUSE I WORKED HARDER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING-- THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF HARDWORKING PEOPLE OUT THERE. IF YOU'VE GOT A BUSINESS, YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT. SOMEBODY ELSE MADE THAT HAPPEN.
Jon:  WHERE WAS THE MIDDLE PART ABOUT THE BRIDGES AND ROADS? YOU DIDN'T EVEN FLASH THROUGH IT. YOU JUST HAD OBAMA DISSOLVE INTO DUST LIKE A BAD VAMPIRE. THAT'S NOT CONTEXT. THAT'S JUST DIFFERENT NO CONTEXT. I THINK THAT MIGHT BE DISINGENUOUS MUPPET SHAPED PROPAGANDA.
MEET THE FOUNDERS OF COOL BLAST LEMONADE, SISTERS SEVEN-YEAR-OLD CLARA AND  FOUR-YEAR-OLD ELIZA SUTTON. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  GO ON.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT YOU NEEDED HELP TO START THIS BUSINESS AND  JUST SPEAK FROM-- SPEAK FROM WITHIN.
I WOULD SAY THAT'S RUDE BECAUSE WE WORKED VERY HARD TO BUILD THIS BUSINESS. BUT WE DID HAVE HELP.
AND YOUR HELP CAME FROM...?
OUR HELP CAME FROM OUR INVESTORS, OUR DAD AND STEPMOM, ALONG WITH OTHER FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY.
Jon:  CUT THE FEED! CUT THE FEED! ( LAUGHTER ) CUT THE FEED! RED EAGLE! CAPTAIN JAMMIES AND LITTLE PRINCESS SAID THEY HAD HELP! THEY'RE GOING ROGUE! ( LAUGHTER ) SO THEY HAD HELP FROM THEIR FAMILIES, LITERALLY, BIG BROTHER. ( LAUGHTER ) LOOK, THE CAMPAIGNS ALL LIKE TO HAVE FUN WITH GAFFES, MAKE IT A  BIG DEAL OUT OF A MISSTATEMENT IS A GREAT WAY TO WIN A NEWS CYCLE. "THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS DOING FINE. I LIKE FIRING PEOPLE. I'LL TRANSMIT THIS INFORMATION TO VLADIMIR. I REAL ESTATE LIKE FIRING PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY POOR ONES. BUT THIS ISN'T A GAFFE AND MITT ROMNEY IS NOT HAVING A LITTLE FUN WITH IT. THE DELIBERATE MISSTATING OF OBAMA'S POSITION IS NOW THE CENTERPIECE OF ROMNEY'S ENTIRE CAMPAIGNS. HE'S GOT SIGNAGE, T-SHIRTS, AND THIS UNRELENTING AD.
IF YOU'VE GOT A BUSINESS, YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT. IF YOU'VE GOT A BUSINESS THAT-- YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT. IF YOU'VE GOT A BUSINESS, THAT-- YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT.
Jon:  APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD. APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD. WE GET IT. MR. ROMNEY HANGING YOUR ATTACK ON A PERSON'S SLIGHT GREATICAL MISSTEP IS WHAT PEOPLE DO IN AN  ARGUMENT WHEN THEY'RE COMPLETELY ( BLEEP ) AND THEY KNOW THEY HAVE NO ARGUMENT. I KNOW YOU, MITT ROMNEY, WOULD LIKE THIS ELECTION TO BE A STARK CHOICE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  BETWEEN OBAMA'S VISION OF A MARXIST STATE-RUN OLIGARCHY AND YOUR SIMPLE ODE TO THE FREEDOM  OUR FOUNDERS ENVISIONED, BECAUSE GIVEN THAT CHOICE YOU WOULD... COME REALLY CLOSE. ( LAUGHTER ). BUT YOU'RE NOT RUNNING AGAINST THIS GUY, STRAWMAN JOHNSON. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENCES IN ECONOMIC POLICY BETWEEN AND  YOU THE PRESIDENT THAT YOU COULD USE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR ECONOMY THAT MIGHT EVEN BE  PRODUCTIVE FOR OUR FUTURE WELL-BEING. BUT THAT DISCUSSION IS A MATTER OF DEGREES NOT A MATTER OF FUNDAMENTAL DIAMETRICALLY  OPPOSED WORLD VIEWS. HERE'S HOW I KNOW-- MR. PRESIDENT AND MR. ROMNEY, ARGUE IT OUT.
IF YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL, SOMEBODY ALONG THE LINE GAVE YOU SOME HELP.
I KNOW THAT YOU RECOGNIZE A LOT OF PEOPLE HELP YOU IN A BUSINESS.
THERE WAS A GREAT TEACHER SOMEWHERE IN YOUR LIFE.
YOUR SCHOOL TEACHERS.
GOVERNMENT RESEARCH CREATED THE INTERNET SO THAT ALL THE COMPANIES COULD MAKE MONEY OFF  THE INTERNET.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT WHO HELP US AND ALLOW TO US HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS.
SOMEBODY INVESTED IN ROADS AND BRIDGES.
PEOPLE WHO BUILD ROADS.
IF YOU'VE GOT A BUSINESS.
YOU REALLY COULDN'T HAVE A BUSINESS IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THOSE THINGS.
YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT.
TAKE THAT, MR. PRESIDENT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WE'LL BE RIGHT
