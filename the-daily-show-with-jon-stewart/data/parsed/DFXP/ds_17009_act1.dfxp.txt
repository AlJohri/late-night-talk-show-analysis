OCTOBER 24, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A GOOD ONE. HERE'S WHAT WE'VE GOT GOING. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS KEVIN CLASH, BETTER KNOWN AS THE VOICE OF ELMO AND YES I DO  PLAN ON TICKLING HIM. SO I SPENT THE WEEKEND WATCHING A LITTLE FOOTBALL, BASEBALL, HAVING SOME SNACKS. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS OCCUPYING THIS WEEKEND? ME STREET. I WAS OUT, I'M A LITTLE OVERLY THEATRICAL AS WELL. IT'S BEEN A BORING NEWS WEEKEND. DID I MISS ANYTHING.
RICK PERRY.
AFGHANISTAN.
HERMAN CAIN'S BIZARRE....
McRIBS.
Jon: ONE AT A TIME. ONE AT A TIME.
TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY BROUGHT THE ISSUE OVER THE PRESIDENT'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE  BACK IN THE HEADLINES IN AN INTERVIEW WITH PARADE MAGAZINE.
PERRY SUGGESTED HE WENT QUITE SURE IF THE PRESIDENT'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS LEGIT.
Jon: DIDN'T THAT BOAT SAIL LAST SPRING? APPARENTLY RICK PERRY, SEEN HERE ON THE COVER OF PARADE MAGAZINE, SUGGESTED... SUGGESTIVELY OFFERING THE NATION HIS NIPPLE. "HEY, AMERICA, HEY, AMERICA. ARE YOU HUNGRY?" "ARE YOU HUNGRY? DO YOU WANT TO SUCKAL?" "THAT'S GOOD TEAT RIGHT THERE. SUCK ON A GOOD BARBECUE SAUCE." PERRY HAS PICKED UP THE TORCH EVEN DONALD TRUMP DROPPED SIX  MONTHS AGO THAT SUGGESTS PERHAPS NONE OF US HAVE SEEN THE PRESIDENT'S REAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE. THIS REPRESENTS PROGRESS. RIGHT NOW HE'S ONLY SIX MONTHS BEHIND THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION. BUT HIS N-WORD FAMILY HUNTING GROUND WAS LIKE 150 YEARS BEHIND. SO IN MANY WAYS PERRY IS ACTUALLY GAINING TIME. NORMALLY PERRY GOES BIRTHER, NO TIME.
HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR WAS SUPPOSED TO PEEK AT PEN WHARTON SCHOOL OF BUSINESS.
BUT HIS OFFICE CANCELED THE APPEARANCE AFTER LEARNING 300 SEATS WOULD BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.
Jon: OH, THE PUBLIC. HEAVENS TO BETSY, WELL, I NEVER. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. HOLD ON. I'M SORRY. SORRY. I MEANT TO SAY YOU SOUND LIKE A... SERIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE A SPEECH ABOUT INCOME  INEQUALITY BUT YOU CANCEL IT? I GUESS TO ERIC CANTOR 300 EMPTY SEATS FEELS LIKE THIS. THE POOR HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT. NEXT STORY.
SO TODAY I CAN REPORT THAT AS PROMISED, THE REST OF OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ WILL COME HOME  BY THE END OF THE YEAR. AFTER NEARLY NINE YEARS, AMERICA'S WAR IN IRAQ WILL BE OVER.
Jon: IT'S OVER. FIND ME... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WOOO! YES. IT'S OVER. IT'S FINALLY OVER. OH, MAN. LET ME TELL YOU THIS. WOO-HOOO.
THEY EITHER FAILED TO DO IT BY VIRTUE OF INEPTITUDE OR THEY DECIDED THAT IT WASN'T  THAT IMPORTANT POLITICALLY OR OTHERWISE.
THIS WAS A FAILURE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO CLOSE THE DEAL.
I THINK IT'S A SERIOUS MISTAKE.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A FAILURE WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY.
Jon: BRINGING SOLDIERS HOME. THEN THEY'RE GOING TO COME AND TAKE OUR JOBS. YEAH, WHAT IS OBAMA DOING PULLING OUR TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ BY THE END OF THE YEAR 2011. WHO'S STUPID IDEA WAS THAT?
WE'RE HERE AT THE REQUEST OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT, THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT. THERE ARE CERTAIN BENCHMARKS THAT WILL BE MET SUCH AS TROOPS OUT OF THE CITIES BY JUNE OF '09. THEN THERE'S A BENCHMARK AT THE END OF THE AGREEMENT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THE STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT BUSH SIGNED WITH THE IRAQIS. I WONDER WHAT WAS THE BENCHMARK AT THE END OF THAT AGREEMENT THAT HE SIGNED WITH  THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT. HERE IT IS. ALL THE UNITED STATES FORCES SHALL WITHDRAW NO LATER THAN DECEMBER 31, 2011. OOPS. WHY DIDN'T THE POINT OF THAT SPEECH GET MORE COVERAGE? TODAY WE ARE REPORTING NEWS THAT THE AMERICAN FORCES PLEDGED TO LEAVE IRAQ BY-- SHOE! DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT REASONS FOR DISLIKING OBAMA'S RADICAL DECISION TO DO THE THING  GEORGE BUSH SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO DO.
IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY TIME WE HAVE DEPOSED A DICTATOR, THE UNITED STATES HAS ALWAYS LEFT TROOPS BEHIND TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE FRAGILE PEACE.
Jon: YOUR SEASON IS BUT WE NEVER LEAVE COUNTRIES WE'VE INVADED. YOU MUST THEN BE HAPPY ABOUT THE WAY THINGS WENT IN LIBYA. WE GOT RID OF THE DICTATOR WITHOUT EVER COMMITTING GROUND FORS.
I OPPOSED THE PRESIDENT PUTTING US INTO WAR IN LIBYA. ONE THING WE SHOULD HAVE LEARNED IN THE LAST 12 YEARS IS THAT ONCE WE ARE INVOLVED  IN A FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT, IN A FOREIGN ENTANGLEMENT, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUT. IT'S USUALLY AT A GREAT PRICE.
Jon: AND I RESENT THIS PRESIDENT HELPING TO DEPOSE QADDAFI WITHOUT THE  COMPLICATIONS AND COSTS OF A NEVER-ENDING OCCUPATION. IT'S FRANKLY UNAMERICAN. I WON'T STAND FOR IT. BACHMANN'S OCCUPY WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT STREET PROTESTS OVER OUR PULLOUT FROM IRAQ IS  AT LEAST MORE WELCOME THAN THE BALLS OF SENATORS McCAIN AND GRAHAM. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT MENTAL IMAGE.
WELL I THINK IT'S A SERIOUS MISTAKE. I'M HERE IN THE REGION. YES, IT IS VIEWED IN THE REGION AS A VICTORY FOR THE IRANIANS. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT THERE.
THEY ENDD IRAQ POORLY FUMBLED THE BALL INSIDE OF THE TENT. IT WAS HIS JOB, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S JOB TO END THIS WELL. THEY FAILED.
Jon: YOU SEE IT WAS OUR JOB TO START IT BADLY. WE DID THAT. WE WERE (BEEP) IDIOTS. HIS JOB IS TO FINISH IT WELL. THAT'S JUST HOW THINGS GO. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  YOU KNOW, SETTLE DOWN. FOR THE GUYS WHO BEAR A GOOD AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY FORGETTING US INTO THIS (BEEP)  TO GO OUGHT WALDORF ON THE EXIT, IT'S JUST LIKE THE CAPTAIN OF THE EXXON VALDEZ  STANDING AROUND ALASKA GOING YOU'RE SCRUBBING THE OIL OFF THOSE BIRDS ALL WRONG. YOU SHOULD BE USING STEEL WOOL AND AJAX. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ARE SCREWING UP THE ENVIRONMENT LIKE THIS. FOR GOD'S SAKES IN LIKE THREE DAYS OBAMA HAS TAKEN US DOWN FROM THREE WARS TO ONE. IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? ARE AMERICAS HAWKS HAVING EMPTY NEST SYNDROME? I KNOW IT'S HARD WHEN THEY GROW UP. BUT LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE. WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE AFGHANISTAN.
SPEAKING WITH A PRIVATE PAKISTANI TELEVISION STATION KARZAI SAID, QUOTE, THIS. IF FIGHTING STARTS BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND THE U.S., WE ARE BESIDE PAKISTAN.
IF PAKISTAN IS ATTACKED AND IF THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN NEED AFGHANISTAN'S HELP, AFGHANISTAN WILL BE THERE WITH YOU.
Jon: AFGHANISTAN, THAT KID IS GOING TO LIVE AT HOME FOREVER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
