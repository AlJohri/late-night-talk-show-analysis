( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK! LIFE. ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN ASK IT BEGIN? SOME SAY CONCEPTION. OTHERS SAY IT DOESN'T BEGIN UNTIL THE FIRST TIME YOU ACTUALLY GET LAID. ( LAUGHTER ). THAT'S A BIG GAP. CAN THE LAW TRULY CODIFY IT?
PERSONHOOD, IT'S A FIERCELY DEBATED MOVEMENT THAT REDEFINES THE BEGINNING OF LIFE. BUT IN OKLAHOMA, THEY'VE SETTLED THE DEBATE.
THE OKLAHOMA STATE SENATE VOTED TO ESTABLISH THAT LIFE BEGINS AT THE MOMENT OF CONCEPTION. THE SO-CALLED PERSONHOOD BILL WOULD GIVE EMBRYOS AND FETUSES ALL THE RIGHTS AND IMMUNITIES OF  OTHER CITIZENS.
YET, SOME THINK PERSONHOOD DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH, LIKE  STATE SENATOR CONSTANCE JOHNSON.
I PUT FORTH AN AMENDMENT THAT OUTLAWS THE DEPOSITING OF SPERM  ANYWHERE OTHER THAN A WOMAN'S VAGINA.
WHY.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROTECTING LIFE, THEN LET'S TALK  ABOUT LIFE AT ITS VERY BASIC BEGINNING.
BUT EVEN PRO-LIFE ADVOCATES LIKE STATE SENATOR AND PERSONHOOD SUPPORTER RALPH  SHORTY THINK JOHNSON'S AMENDMENT IS AN OVER-REACH.
I THINK THE JAWNSOB AMENDMENT IS AN EGREGIOUS ATTACK ON PERSONAL LIBERTIES FROM THE  GOVERNMENT AND QUITE FRANKLY, IT'S EMBARRASSING THAT THIS WAS EVEN BROUGHT UP. IT'S A RIDICULOUS NOTION.
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS PRO-LIFE STATE SENATOR'S REASONING.
ONE, IT WOULD BE A HUGE FREE CHOICE ISSUE. BASICALLY, THE GOVERNMENT IS TELLING THE MAN WHAT HE CAN AND CAN'T DO WITH HIS BODY.
OKAY...
THERE'S NOT ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL THAT KNOWS WHAT'S BETTER FOR YOU THAN YOU.
AND WHO ARE WOMEN TO THINK THEY CAN CONTROL OUR BODIES.
RIGHT. ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, THAT'S THE-- THAT WOULD BE-- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ABOUT  A-- THE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO CONTROL A WOMAN'S BODY. IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING A LIFE. WHEN YOU HAVE LIFE INSIDE YOUR BODY, IT SHOULD BE THE GOVERNMENT'S PLACE TO PROTECT THAT LIFE. EVEN IF IT DOES INFRINGE ON YOUR LIBERTIES.
BUT SENATOR JOHNSON'S VIEW OF WHEN LIFE BEGINS IS EARLY THAN YOURSELF. SHOULDN'T WE PLAY IT SAFE.
A SINGLE SPERM CELL ON ITS OWN CANNOT CREATE LIFE.
SO YOU'RE ABOUT PROTECTING PRODUCT AND NOT THE INGREDIENTS.
RIGHT, YEAH.
OKAY, SO THIS ISN'T A PERSON, BUT THIS-- WAIT FOR IT-- NOT A PERSON, NOT A PERSON, NOT A PERSON, NOT A PERSON-- PERSON! AND IF STATE SENATOR JOHNSON'S AMENDMENT PASSES, THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE DIRE FOR  MEN'S HEALTH.
YOU KNOW, IF-- IF-- EVEN IF A WOMAN WASN'T INVOLVED, AND YOU  WERE DOING SOMETHING ON YOUR OWN, IT WOULD STILL BE AWE CRIME.
LIKE WHAT? >>, HUYOU KNOW, TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF.
I STILL DON'T FOLLOW.
A MAN COULD EVEN MASTURBATE.
WHAT? REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT HER INTENTION IS.
YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS AWAY FROM ME. I'M ON THE ROAD CONSTANTLY.
THAT IS NOT MY PROBLEM.
ARE YOU ASKING ME TO CHEAT ON MY WIFE?
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT YOU TAKE HER WITH YOU.
AND NOBODY WANTS THAT. ( LAUGHTER ).
IF KILL A ZYGOTE IS MURDER, WASTING SEMEN SHOULD BE MURDER.
CAN I BE TRIED FOR PAST CRIMES BECAUSE I GOTTA TELL YOU, I'M, LIKE, SPERM HITLER.
I HOPE NOW YOU FEEL TO SOME EXTENT WHAT THE WOMEN IN OKLAHOMA ARE FEELING ABOUT THE  PERSONHOOD BILL.
WOMEN? FORGET ABOUT WOMEN. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REAL VICTIMS OF A DRACONIAN LEGISLATION. I TRIED TO BREAK IT TO THEM GENTLY.
SO WHAT'S UP? ( LAUGHTER )
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
HOW DO I SAY THIS? SENATOR JOHNSON IN OKLAHOMA IS GOING TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO DO DO... THE ONE THING TEENAGED BOYS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO COUNT ON. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
NO. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
UHM( BLEEP ). YOU GUYS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE BIRDS AND THE BEES, RIGHT? LET'S TAKE THE BIRDS OUT OF THE EQUATION, AND JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE BEES ARE  BY THEMSELVES AND THEY HAVE A SOLID INTERNET CONNECTION. ( LAUGHTER ) HUH?
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ( BLEEP )?
NO, NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ( BLEEP ). I'M TALKING ABOUT FREEDOM.
UHM, UH, HOW ARE THEY GOING TO KNOW, LIKE, WHEN WE'RE, UH.
DOING WHAT HE SAID.
DOING WHAT HE SAID, YEAH.
THEY KNOW. LAUGH TRUST ME. GOVERNMENT IS EVERYWHERE. AND HER AMENDMENT WILL CAUSE MALE REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE TO BE A THING OF THE PAST. HOW MUCH TIME IS LEFT?
WELL, LET ME EASE YOUR MIND. IT DID NOT PASS.
OH, THANK GOD. WHERE'S YOUR BATHROOM?
IT'S RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.
DO YOU MIND GOING THERE, BECAUSE I NEED TO USE YOUR COMPUTER. SERIOUSLY. AND ARE THEY TRACKING COOKIES ON THAT?
YES, PLEASE DON'T USE MY COMPUTER.
OH, MY
