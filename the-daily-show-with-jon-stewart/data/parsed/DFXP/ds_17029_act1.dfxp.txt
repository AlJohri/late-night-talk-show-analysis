DECEMBER 5, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TODAY. WAR PHOTOGRAPHER BEN LOWY WILL BE JOINING US TONIGHT. WE HAVE A NICE ONE. WAR PHOTOGRAPHER BEN LOWY WILL BE JOINING US TONIGHT. A COURAGEOUS AND FINE INDIVIDUAL. AND I AM NOT. THAT WILL BE THE GENERAL DYNAMIC FOR TONIGHT. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE BIG NEWS FROM THE WEEKEND. ON SATURDAY PIZZA MOGUL AND ALLEGED LADY FONDLER HERMAN CAIN TOLD THE PRESS HE'D BE  MAKING A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE FATE OF HIS CAMPAIGN. CAIN IS A MAN WHO BELIEVES IT'S APPROPRIATE TO REFER TO A FORMER SATELLITE AS UZBEKISTAN-  STAN AND HAS NEVER MET A QUESTION HE COULDN'T ANSWER WITH 9-9-9. I HOST A COMEDY PROGRAM AND DON'T LIKE WORKING HARD. SO WE BELONG TOGETHER. WHEN I LOOK AT HIM I DON'T SEE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, I SEE... (LAUGHING) ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET TO IT.
I WOULD ASK THAT YOU GIVE A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME TO MY GOOD FRIEND AND  PROFESSIONAL DO-ER, MR. HERMAN CAIN. ( APPLAUSE ) ♪
Jon: WHO DOES THAT? THERE'S A HERMAN CAIN YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY PLANNED THIS OR IF HE WAS LATE. (BEEP) THEY JUST SAID MY NAME! GAS IT. SERIOUSLY WHO PLANS SOMETHING LIKE THAT. LIKE, HEY, I'VE GOT AN IDEA. YOU INTRODUCE ME. I WON'T BE THERE. I'LL BE ON MY (BEEP) BUS. I'M SURE THE CROWD IS LIKE, THEY SAID HIS NAME AND THEN IN THE GREAT DISTANCE WE HEARD HIM ROAR. THEN WE SAW IT. HIS BUS.
AS OF TODAY WITH A LOT OF PRAYER AND SOUL SEARCHING, I AM SUSPENDING MY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. (CROWD BOOING) (DAILY SHOW CROWD CHEERING).
Jon: DID YOU HEAR HIS CROWD? HIS SUPPORTERS ARE LIKE, OH, BOO. OH, NO. I MEAN THE GUY JUST WOWED YOU WITH THAT WHOLE BUS STAGE THING AND ALL YOU CAN MUSTER  IS LIKE, NO, DON'T. QUIT. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE EMOTION? THESE ARE MY WRITERS WHEN THEY FIRST FOUND OUT.
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THIS WAY.
OH, GOD. OH, MAN.
(BEEP) (BEEP) (BEEP) (BEEP).
Jon: THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY HOW IT WAS. NONE OF MY WRITERS ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT A TELEVISION. HERMAN CAIN SEEMED TO SENSE THAT HIS SUPPORTERS NEEDED SOMETHING TO LIFT THEIR  SPIRITS WHICH IS WHAT LED TO HERMAN CAIN SAYING THE GREATEST NINE WORDS EVER SPOKEN BY AN AMERICAN POLITICIAN.
I BELIEVE THESE WORDS CAME FROM THE POKEMON MOVIE. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: GO ON.
LIFE CAN BE A CHALLENGE. LIFE CAN SEEM IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S NEVER EASY WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH ON THE LINE.
Jon: I'M GOING TO MISS HIM SO. OF COURSE, MR. CAIN PERFORMED THAT ALMOST AS WELL AS ITS ORIGINAL PERFORMER DONNA SUMMER. ♪ LIFE CAN BE A CHALLENGE ♪♪  ♪ LIFE CAN SEEM IMPOSSIBLE ♪♪ ♪ IT'S NEVER EASY WHEN SO MUCH  IS ON THE LINE ♪♪ (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. HERMAN CAIN'S FAREWELL ADDRESS, WORDS OF WISDOM TO HIS FOLLOWERS AND SUPPORTERS, THE FINAL MOMENTS OF HIS CAMPAIGN  ARE FROM THE CLOSING CREDITS OF THE POKEMON MOVIE. THE THING THEY PLAY TO GET YOU THE (BEEP) OUT OF THE THEATER. IF I MAY QUOTE FROM TITANIC: NEAR. FAR. WHEREVER YOU ARE. MY HEART WILL GO ON. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  YOU KNOW, THIS GUY... FIRST OF ALL  (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ... I CAN'T EVEN. FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT EVEN THE MOST INSPIRATIONAL QUOTE FROM THE POKEMON MOVIE. MEWTWO:.
I SEE THAT THE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF ONE'S BIRTH ARE IRRELEVANT. IT IS WHAT YOU DO WITH THE GIFT OF LIFE THAT DETERMINES WHO YOU ARE.
Jon: WELL SAID MAGIC JAPANESE CAT MONSTER WHO WAS CREATED AS THE RESULT OF A  GENETIC EXPERIMENT AND THEREFORE HAS PSYCHIC POWERS. WELL SAID. OF COURSE, CONSIDERING WHAT LED CAIN TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE, THIS IS THE POKEMON 2000  LINE HE REALLY SHOULD HAVE QUOTED.
I COULD USE PANTS. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: TO BE FAIR TO HERMAN CAIN, WE CAN'T ALL BE AS WISE  AS SLOWKING WHEN HE'S WEARING THE SHELLDER OF KNOWLEDGE. LOOK IT UP. SHELLDER OF KNOWLEDGE. WHERE IS DOES THAT LEAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY? YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT.
I'M GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE. I MEAN IT'S VERY HARD NOT TO LOOK AT THE RECENT POLLS AND THINK THAT THE ODDS ARE VERY  HIGH I'M GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE.
Jon: WHAT? WHAT IS SO CRAZY? REPUBLICANES ARE UP NEWT CREEK WITHOUT A PADDLE. WHY WILL NEWT BE THE NOMINEE?
THOSE GUYS WERE THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK AND ISN'T THIS WONDERFUL AND BOY IT WOULD BE  GREAT IF IT WORKED OUT AND WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. I'M THE GUY WHO HAS BEEN AROUND FOREVER.
Jon: THAT'S NEWT GINGRICH'S PITCH. I'M THE THING THAT HAS BEEN IN YOUR PANTRY FOREVER. YOU COULD TRY YOUR NEW FANGLED POP TARTS AND YOUR EGGO WAFFLES BUT IF YOU LOOK WAY  BACK IN THERE, THERE'S A CAN OF LaCHOY BABY CORN, A PRODUCT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT STILL BE  OFFERED BY THE LaCHOY COMPANY. YOU DON'T REMEMBER BUYING IT YET YOU DON'T REMEMBER EVER BEING WITHOUT IT. AND NOW, YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ELECT IT PRESIDENT. I'M NEWT GINGRICH AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
