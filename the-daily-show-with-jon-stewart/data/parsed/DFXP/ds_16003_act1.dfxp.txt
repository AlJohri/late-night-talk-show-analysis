JANUARY 5, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WHAT A PROGRAM TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT JIMMY WALES, COFOUNDER OF WIKIPEDIA. YOU CAN GET ANYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA, WHERE MY GRANDPARENTS ARE FROM YOU CAN LOOK UP. JIMMY WALES IS THE COFOUNDER OF WIKIPEDIA. IT'S SOMETHING I FOUND OUT ON WIKIPEDIA. LOOKING UP WIKIPEDIA ON WIKIPEDIA YOU ENTER A WORM HOLE AND COME OUT OF YOUR OWN (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WON'T SEE ON GOOGLE EARTH. [LAUGHTER] VERY QUICKLY, FOLKS, VERY BIG NEWS TODAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. TAKE A LOOK.
ROBERT GIBBS IS LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE.
Jon: OH, NO! NOW WHO WILL OUR IN ADDITION'S PRESS CORPS TURN TO FOR ITS CHOREOGRAPHED NONANSWERED? [LAUGHTER] LEAVING AFTER TWO YEARS. WHY IS IT NO HUMAN BEING CAN WITHSTAND TWO YEARS AS A PRESIDENTIAL PRESS SECRETARY. THERE MUST BE AN ORGAN SOMEWHERE IN THE BODY THAT CAN ONLY FILTHY TWO YEARS WORTH OF HEAVY DUTY (bleep). [LAUGHTER] NOT THAT THINGS AREN'T TURNING AROUND FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. BY THE WAY, IT'S BEEN A VERY GOOD MONTH FOR THEM. HERE IS HOW I KNOW. NO LOVE LOST WITH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. TODAY IS THE DAY THE REPUBLICANS TAKE POWER IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. YOU EXPECT THE POST GOING APE, CHANGING OF THE GUARD -- SHOULD THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD DRESS LIKE THIS EVEN ON VACATION? [LAUGHTER] THAT'S IT? THAT'S ALL YOU GOT? [LAUGHTER] IT'S A HELL OF A QUESTION, I MY ANSWER IS I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHERE THE LEADER OF THE FREE  WORLD IS LIKE A WORLD SUMMIT. I WOULD SAY NO. ON A HAWAIIAN VACATION ONLINE TO BUY SNOCONES FOR YOUR KIDS, I THINK IT'S GOOD, YEAH. I GUESS NOT EVERYBODY IS AS PRESIDENTIAL AS THE GUY YOU LOVED WAS. YEAH THAT'S PRESIDENT PRESIDENT BUSH IN SPANDEX. YOU KNOW THAT OUTFIT DIDN'T UPSIT ME AS UNPRESIDENTIAL BECAUSE HE WAS ON A BIKE. WASHINGTON IS A FLUTTER WITH THE EXCITEMENT OF ITS INCOMING CROP OF NEW CONGRESS PEOPLE.
THE BIGGEST FRESHMAN CLASS SINCE 1992 WAS SWORN IN TODAY.
A LOT OF NEW FACES COMING TO CAPITOL HILL.
IT'S LIKE THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL ON CAPITOL HILL.
LOOK AT HIM SAL RATE ISING. IT'S THE SAME EXCITEMENT THAT FILLS COLLEGE CAMPUSES EVERY FALL AS THE UPPER CLASSMEN PER  RUSE THE FRESHLY STOCKED POND OF FRESHMAN MEAT PROBING FOR LOW ALCOHOL TOLERANCE. TEA PARTY REFORMER RAN ON SMALLER GOVERNMENT. I WOULD (bleep) YOU THE FIRST WEEK. [LAUGHTER] BUT IT'S NOT ALL THE NEWBIES. IT'S REALLY 90% OLDBIES IN WASHINGTON STILL. THERE'S NO OLDERBIE THAN ARIZONA'S SENIOR SENIOR, SENIOR  EVEN BY ARIZONA'S STANDARDS CHRK IS SAYING SOMETHING, JOHN McCAIN. FUN FACT, THE ONLY SITTING U.S. SENATOR WHO ALSO SERVED IN THE ROMAN SENATE. [LAUGHTER] McCAIN NOW STANDS ON JULIUS CAESAR THAT'S NOT CHANGE WE CAN BELIEVE IN. [LAUGHTER] McCAIN STANDS NOW LESS AS A PARA GONE OF STRAIGHT TALK INDEPENDENCE AND MORE AS AN  OBJECT LESSON AS JUST HOW (bleep) MAD PEOPLE GET WHEN THEY DON'T GET THEIR WAY. FOLLOWING THE HISTORIC REPEAL OF DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL, THE BAN  ON GAYS GAYS TO BEING ABLE TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY.
THIS VOTE WILL PASS IN THE LAME DUCK SESSION. AND THERE WILL BE HIGH FIVES IN THE ELITE SCHOOLS THAT BAR MILITARY RECRUIT KERRS FROM  CAMPUS, IN SALONS OF GEORGETOWN.
Jon: LIBERAL BASTIONS, SALONS OF GEORGETOWN, WHAT DECADE ARE YOU LIVING IN WASHINGTON? YOU KNOW THE REASON THAT KATHRYN GRAHAM DOESN'T INVITE YOU TO DINNER WITH THE FRENCH  AMBASSADOR ANYMORE IS SHE DIED TEN YEARS AGO. NOT TO PUT TOO FINE A POINT ON IT, BUT LIBERAL BASTIONS, I DON'T THINK HIGH FIVE. WE HARUMPH APPROVINGLY. OH, YEAH. HUH. YEAH,. [LAUGHTER] THE GALLING ASPECT OF HIS REACTION IS NOT HIS BYAR CLASS RESENTMENT BECAUSE SERIOUSLY  McCAIN PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN TEN HOUSES SHOULDN'T THROW STONES, BUT IN FACT, HIS DIRE REDECISIONS REGARDING THE INSIDIOUS EFFECT OF GRANTING  AMERICAN CITIZENS FULL RIGHTS TO FIGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY.
SAID TO A VERY SAD DAY. -- TODAY IS A VERY SAD DAY. THE COMANT DANT OF UNITED STATES MA ROAN CORPS SAYS WHEN YOU LIFE  HANGS ON THE LINE YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING DISTRACTING. MISTAKES AND INATTENTION ARE DISTRACTIONS THAT COST MARINES LIVES. I DON'T WANT TO PERMIT THAT OPPORTUNITY TO HAPPEN AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. GO UP TO BETHESDA HOSPITAL THERE'S MARINES WITH NO LEGS, NONE. WE HAVE MARINES WITH NO LIMBS.
Jon: YEAH, BUT HERE IS THIS THE THING:  SOME OF THEM ARE GAY. MAYBE IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE VISITED BY THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS WITHOUT HAVING TO REFER  TO THEM AS A COLLEGE FRIEND OR A TENNIS COACH. HIS OLD MAN CRANKNESS HAS GONE OFF THE CHARTS. HE HAS GONE FROM A MAN OF WISDOM ALL WAIT TO FULL G, RAN TORINO.
GET OFF MY LAWN.
Jon: YEAH. SEEING HOW EASY IT IS TO ANNOY JOCK McCAIN NOW WE'LL MAKE IT OUR MISSION TO DO SO. WE COULD GO THE PUBLIC CALL JOKE ROUTE PERHAPS USING HIS AVERSION TO LIFESTYLES TO GO ON  FOURSQUARE AND CHECK HIM IN AS THE MEMBER OF THE GENTLEMAN'S CLUB OR ADD BIGGER THE CLOTHS SO  HE BELIEVES HE IS SHRINKING OR THERE'S THE CHARLIE RANGEL APPROACH WHERE HE DOES SOMETHING  NEWSWORTHY WHERE HE CREATE AN INCREDIBLY CHILDISH GAG. OR THE MICHAEL STEELE. HOW WILL WE DO IT? I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL FIND OUT WHEN WE ANNOUNCE OUR SENATOR ANNOYING SEGMENT. ♪ ♪ OBVIOUSLY THAT IS FIGURATIVE. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO STAND ON ALL AT ONCE BUT LET'S  ALL STAND ON JOHN McCAIN'S LAWN WE WELCOME A NEW MEMBER OF  "THE DAILY SHOW" TEAM AND QUITE SURPRISING HE WOULD BE WILLING  TO PLAY BALL WITH US AFTER ALL WE SAID ABOUT HIM HERE. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM PUPEL SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. HELLO. YEAH, THAT LITTLE WHAT THERE IS WHAT SOLD IT?
CAN I WALK.
Jon: HELLO SENATOR McCAIN. NICE TO SEE YOU.
TALK OFF YOUR MAKEUP YOU DAMN TROLLOP.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU, CINCH THE LIGHTS ARE TOO BRIGHT. THEY BURN MY SKIN. YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A MEXICAN. BUILD THE DANG FENCE. [LAUGHTER] BUILD IT!
Jon: SENATOR IT'S OUR AUDIENCE. THEY ARE NOT BUILDERS.
THEY COULD PROBABLY BUILD.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU?
I'M THROUGH BEING NICE. YOU ARE A FIRST CLASS (bleep) STEWART AND YOU ARE SHORT, TOO DIP WAD.
Jon: REALLY DICK WAD? YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN BECOME TRULY HORRIBLE?
YEAH, WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW.

Jon: WHAT?
ALL OF YOU. ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS MAKE ME YOUR PRESIDENT BUT NOOOOO. HE'S TOO OLD. HE PICKED SARAH PALIN. HE GOT RID OF EVERY PRINCIPLE HE HELD SACRED. I'M SICK OF YOUR (bleep). SO I GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOU. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BOO-YA! READ IT AND WEEP JEW BOY! [LAUGHTER]
