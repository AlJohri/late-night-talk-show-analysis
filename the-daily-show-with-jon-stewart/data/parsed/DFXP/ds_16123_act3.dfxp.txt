Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE HOST OF THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL'S "THE  O'REILLY FACTOR." HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "KILLING LINCOLN," THE SHOCKING  ASSASSINATION THAT CHANGED AMERICA FOREVER. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM MR. BILL O'REILLY. SIR. [APPLAUSE] A PLEASURE. A PLEASURE.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jon: AS ALWAYS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THE BOOK IS, AND AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO CRITICIZE YOUR COVER  DESIGNER, "BILL O'REILLY KILLING LINCOLN."  [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY...
YES.
Jon: IT IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK AND A NICE READ AND...
Jon: SOMEBODY READ IT TO YOU. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: DAMN YOU, O'REILLY. ALWAYS QUICK ON THE DRAW. EXCELLENT BOOK. YOU'RE GOING TO SELL MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF COPIES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT. [LAUGHTER] HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU, YOU WERE ON YOU SHOW THE OTHER NIGHT, AND I WATCH IT FREQUENTLY. YOU SAY IF OBAMA RAISES YOUR TAXES TO 50%, WHICH YOU BELIEVE IS POSSIBLE, THAT YOU MAY NOT DO  YOUR SHOW ANYMORE.
RIGHT. I MIGHT TAKE COLBERT'S PLACE.
Jon: YEAH. [LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW HE'S TAKING IT.
Jon: SOMEBODY HAS TO. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT THREAT IS EMPTY?
ALL OF IT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
NO, NO, NO. THERE COMES A POINT WHERE IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE TAXED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT 50% AND  THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR PROPERTY TAXES, YOUR SALES TAXES, YOUR TOLLS TO GET INTO  THE CITY, THEY CHARGE YOU ADMISSION TO GET INTO NEW YORK CITY, $14.50.
Jon: AND YET FREE TO GO THE NEW JERSEY. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
THERE COMES A POINT WHERE YOU SAY, IS THIS WORTH IT OR NOT.
Jon: REALLY?
YOU AND I BOTH WORK HARD. WELL, I DO. [AUDIENCE REACTS] HEY, HE'S GOT 18 WRITERS BACK THERE.
Jon: SOMEBODY'S GOT THE PEEL THE CARROT. IT'S TRUE.
BUT YOU AND I EMPLOY A LOT OF PEOPLE.
Jon: WE'RE JOB CREATORS.
WE ARE, THE ENTREPRENEURIAL CLASS.
Jon: BUT THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THE TAX BURDEN WOULD BECOME SO ONEROUS ON US  THAT WE WOULD JUST RATHER NOT TAKE HOME $3 MILLION IF WE CAN'T  GET THE $3.5 MILLION, [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THAT'S CRAZY TALK AND YOU KNOW IT.
YOU'RE NOT MAKING THAT MUCH MONEY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HERE'S ALL I'M SAYING, WHAT IS THIS WHOLE BUSINESS WITH THE POOR, POOR RICH AND WEALTHY IN THIS COUNTRY, SO UNFAIR TO THEM.
ARE YOU EVER GOING TO WISE UP EVER? I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS DANCE.
Jon: TEACH ME, PROFESSOR. TEACH ME. TEACH ME.
I DON'T MIND PAYING 40%, BUT FIRST THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO  STOP WASTING THE MONEY. ONE WORD, SOLINDRA. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
Jon: YES, I DO.
HOW MUCH WAS WASTED THERE
Jon: $520 MILLION.
$528 MILLION. IF YOU CLEAN IT UP, IF YOU STOP WASTING IT, THEN YOU COME TO THE  JOB CREATORS, AND WE'LL HELP YOU OUT.
Jon: LET ME JUST VERY QUICKLY, SOLINDRA WAS AN INVESTMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF  ENERGY MADE, I THINK IT WAS $10 BILLION OR $20 BILLION, IN NEW ENERGY TECHNOLOGY --
SOLAR PANELS.
Jon: THAT WAS ONE. THERE'S ALSO WIND AND NUCLEAR. THAT WAS ABOUT HALF OF THE PERCENT OF THE MONEY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY SPENT. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NO LONGER IN ANY WAY SUBSIDIZE NEW INDUSTRIES  BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT, NO INTERNET, NO ROADS TO LONG ISLAND. [LAUGHTER]
THERE ARE L ALWAYS BE ROADS TO LONG ISLAND. NOW LISTEN...
Jon: THAT'S MY POINT.
YOU'VE GOT TO DOWNSIZE THE GOVERNMENT SO THEY CAN WATCH  WHAT'S HAPPENING AND MAKE INTELLIGENT DECISIONS. IT'S INSANE. RIGHT NOW... LOOK, THE $16 MUFFIN. DO WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE $16 MUFFIN IS?
Jon: WHAT?
SEE, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE $16 MUFFIN IS.
Jon: WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD DO YOU LIVE IN? WHAT MAKES A $16 MUFFIN?
THIS IS GREAT. I'M GLAD. LOOK...
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
$16 MUFFIN. BROCK THIS STORY LAST WEEK ON "THE FACTOR." YOU WERE OTHERWISE OCCUPIED, MAKING YOUR LITTLE WISE REMARKS. NOT READING WHAT'S HAPPENING. THEY HAD A BUNCH OF CONFERENCES FOR PINHEADS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND THEY ORDERED  $250 MUFFINS AT $16 APIECE.
Jon: THAT'S A LOT FOR MUFFINS.
YEAH! AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I PAID FOR THE MUFFINS.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
AND SO DID YOU.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH WALL STREET?
NO. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BECAUSE THERE'S THIS IDEA...
IS THAT RUN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT?
Jon: NO, IT'S NOT.
NOT YET.
Jon: NO, IT'S NOT, BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THEY HAD A  LITTLE PROBLEM THAT ADDED UP TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS MORE THAN, WHAT'S $16 TIMES 250 MUFFINS? SO CAPITALISM ALSO FINDS ITSELF GOING ASTRAY SOMETIMES AND WRECKING OUR ECONOMY. IF YOU BELIEVE WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE GOOD BUBBLE-AND-BUST DAYS OF THE 1890s.
I DON'T WANT THE BUBBLE AND BUST DAYS.
Jon: EXACTLY.
I WANT EFFICIENCY IN ALL AREAS.
Jon: SO YOU AND I ARE AGREEING HERE.
SIMPATICO.
Jon: YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SPEAK A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, IT IS ODDLY AROUSING. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] COME ON, COME ON. HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WHEN HE GETS OVER HIS NERVOUS FEELINGS, HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING  TO SAY, KILLING LINCOLN IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. GO BUY THIS BOOK. THIS MAN MAY NOT DO IT ANY LONGER. SO GO BUY HIS BOOK RIGHT NOW. HELP HIM FEED HIS FAMILY. WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK WITH MORE. IT WILL BE UP ON THE WEB. MR. BILL O'REILLY. WE'RE COMING RIGHT BACK.
