Jon: WELCOME BACK. RIGHT NOW IN ARIZONA, TERRIBLE WILDFIRES HAVE BURNED MORE THAN 40 SQUARE MILES, DESTROYING  DOZENS OF HOMES. IT'S A HORRIBLE SITUATION OUT THERE. BUT HOW DID IT START? DROUGHT CONDITIONS? HIGH WINDS? HIGH TEMPERATURES, OR WAS IT PERHAPS SOMETHING ELSE?
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PARTICULARLY AREAS DOWN ON THE BORDER WHERE THERE IS  SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT SOME OF THESE FIRES ARE CAUSED BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CROSSED OUR  BORDER ILLEGALLY.
Jon: HUH. HOW DO YOU KNOW IF A FIRE IS STARTED BY AN ILLEGAL OR A REGULAR? IS THERE LIKE ME SKEET TANG TO THE SMOKE? I GUESS EVIDENCE IS EVIDENCE.
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE SAYS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT McCAIN'S CLAIM.
Jon: OR NOT. [LAUGHTER] I WONDER HOW McCAIN WILL ADDRESS HIS EARLIER STATEMENT THAT SOME OF THESE FIRES WERE  CAUSED BY PEOPLE WHO CROSSED ILLEGALLY.
I DID NOT SAY THAT THE WILDFIRE WAS CAUSED BY PEOPLE WHO CROSSED ILLEGALLY. I JUST SAID SOME OF THESE FIRES, AND THAT'S BEEN COMED. SO I AM STILL NOT CLEAR WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.
Jon: YEAH,. SEE NOW I'M CONFUSED. BECAUSE EARLIER IN THE THING YOU SAID WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THESE FIRES... YOU KNOW, PERHAPS THE  ONLY WAY TO SETTLE THIS IS TO SPEAK TO SENATOR McCAIN HIMSELF, BUT SINCE HE [BLEEPED] HATES US... [LAUGHTER] ...PERHAPS WE SHOULD JUST WELCOME SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. SENATOR, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. [LAUGHTER] THANKS FOR COMING BACK ON THE SHOW.
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. BUILD THE DANG FENCE.
Jon: BUILD THE DANG FENCE INDEED. SENATOR, SOME PEOPLE THINK IN THAT FIRST CLIP THAT WE SHOWED THAT YOU WERE BLAMING ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANTS FOR THE WILDFIRE IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA.
JON, YOU JUST DON'T GET THAT. I NEVER SAID IMMIGRANTS STARTED THE FIRE. I JUST SAID IMMIGRANTS START FIRES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU DID, THOUGH, AT A PRESS CONFERENCE ABOUT A SPECIFIC FIRE, AND YOU DID SAY  IN YOUR STATEMENT, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND THESE FIRES, "THESE."
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THESE FIRES WERE STARTED BY ILLEGAL  ALIEN, WHICH IS NOT WHAT I WAS SAYING BUT IT'S TRUE ANYWAY AND NOW I'M SAYING IT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO YOU ARE SAYING...
NO! STOP MISQUOTING ME. JON, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING, MEXICANS START FIRES. THEY'RE FIRE STARTERS. I SAW ONE EAT A PLATE OF HABANERO PEPPERS AND FART BLUE FLAMES. [LAUGHTER] TOOK OFF LIKE THE SPACE SHUTTLE. OH, OH, GEEZ, NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD A TALLER FENCE.
Jon: NO. THEY'RE NOT FLYING FART MACHINES, SIR. I DON'T THINK...
YOU DON'T LIVE WHERE I DO.
I UNDERSTAND, THAT BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE MORE FLAMMABLE THAN OTHER RACES. THAT'S JUST NOT...
WELL, I DIDN'T EVEN BRING UP THE OTHER STUFF THEY'RE DOING, LIKE BREAKING AND ENTERING IN MY OWN HOUSE.
Jon: SIR, THAT IS TERRIBLE. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE THE VICTIM OF A BREAKIN. WHAT DID THEY TAKE?
THEY DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING. I FELL ASLEEP ON THE COUCH, AND THEY SNUCK IN AND HID MY REMOTE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SNUCK IN THE HOUSE AND HID YOUR REMOTE?
STUCK IT IN THE FREEZER LIKE A BUNCH OF MANIACS. I HAD TO BUILD A DANG FENCE AROUND MY CLICKER. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SIR, DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT?
MY CLICKER WAS COLD AS HELL. THAT'S MY EVIDENCE. AND IT'S NOT FIRST TIME THEY SNUCK AROUND. LAST NIGHT I CAUGHT ONE OF THEM KNOCKING OVER MY TRASH CANS. HE WAS CRAWLING AROUND ON ALL FOURS, WEARING A LITTLE FURRY MASK. [LAUGHTER]
DID THIS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HAVE A TAIL BY ANY CHANCE?
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A RACCOON?
OH, OH, OH, NOW WHO IS BEING RACIST? [LAUGHTER] YOU CAN'T DENY... JON, YOU CAN'T DENY WE HAVE A PROBLEM. IMMIGRANTS ARE STEALING MY PILLS, MAKING MY LEGS TWITCH. THEY TOOK MY READING GLASSES AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE A DAMN THING FOR THREE WEEKS.
Jon: WERE YOU READING GLASSES LIKE THE ONES THAT ARE HANGING AROUND YOUR NECK RIGHT NOW?
OH, NOW THEY'RE JUST  [BLEEPED] WITH ME.
Jon: THANK YOU, SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, EVERYBODY.
