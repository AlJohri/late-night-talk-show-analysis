WELCOME BACK. AS YOU PROBABLY NOTICED, AS YOU PROBABLY NOTICED WHILE YOU WERE EATING THE TURKEY FIVE  DAYS AGO NEXT TO YOUR DRUNK UNCLE, LAST THURSDAY WAS THANKSGIVING. A HOLIDAY THAT BRINGS WITH IT ALL SORTS OF TRADITION INCLUDING THE GREETING FROM  OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
I'D LIKE TO WISH YOU A HAPPY THANKSGIVING. LIKE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, MICHELLE, MALIA, SASH A AND I WILL SPEND THE DAY EATING GREAT FOOD, WATCHING A LITTLE  FOOTBALL AND REFLECTING ON HOW TRULY LUCKY WE ARE.
Jon: OH, YES. VERY INSPIRING. PERFECTLY FINE BLAND. IT USUALLY GETS ABOUT 40,000 HITS ON YOU-TUBE OR AROUND 100,000 FEWER THAN THIS VIDEO  OF BABY PANDA SLEEPING. AND TO ANSWER YOUR NEXT QUESTION, NO, WE CAN'T JUST WATCH THAT FOR THE REST OF THE SHOW. SO ANYWAY THANKSGIVING YOU-TUBE ADDRESS ONE OF THOSE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESSS THAT ARE DONE BY ROTE. SPEAKING OF ROTE, UNTHINKING BUSY WORK. THE REACTION.
PRESIDENT OBAMA RUFFLED QUITE A FEW FEATHERS ON TURKEY DAY.
LEAVING GOD OUT OF THANKSGIVING.
HE LEFT GOD OUT OF HIS THANKSGIVING DAY ADDRESS.
WAS THAT A RELIGIOUS SLIGHT OR OVERSIGHT?
HE'S A PRODUCT OF THE SECULAR LEFT.
FORGET ABOUT HIS PERSONAL BELIEFS, HE REPRESENTS THE UNITED STATES.
SOMEONE SHOULD REMIND HIM THE PILGRIMS CAME OVER TO HERE TO CELEBRATE TO BE ABLE TO  RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE ABILITY TO WORSHIP GOD, RIGHT.
Jon: SOMEONE SHOULD REMIND YOU THAT IF I RECALL MY GRADE SCHOOL PAGEANTS CORRECTLY  THANKSGIVING WAS A BUNCH OF PAGANS TEACHING RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS OUT TO FARM. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE THANKING ANYBODY, YOU KNOW, SERIOUSLY FAILING TO MENTION GOD IN YOUR  THANKSGIVING ADDRESS? NOT A HUGE THANKSGIVING FOE PASS. I MEAN, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IF INSTEAD OF PARDONING TWO MALE TURKEYS HE HAD MARRIED THEM. OKAY? AND THEN I COULD UNDERSTAND FOX GETTING BENT OUT OF SHAPE. I MEAN I GUESS IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD THAT OBAMA IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT EVER NOT TO MENTION  GOD IN HIS THANKSGIVING ADDRESS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA ISN'T THE ONLY COMMANDER IN CHIEF IN RECENT HISTORY TO LEAVE GOD  OUT OF THANKSGIVING.
Jon: SO, WHAT?
TO BE FAIR LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH MENTIONED GOD IN SEVEN OUT OF EIGHT ADDRESSES. FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON ONLY MENTIONED GOD IN FOUR OUT OF EIGHT.
Jon: WHO DID YOU MAKE LOOK THAT (BEEP) ON A HOLIDAY WEEKEND? WHO DO YOU DO THAT TO? PRESIDENTS CLINTON AND BUSH BOTH HAD YEARS WHEN THEY DIDN'T MENTION GOD EITHER.
WERB MENTION THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID MENTION GOD IN HIS WRITTEN THANKSGIVING PROCLAMATION.
Jon: NOT ONLY IS OBAMA NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO LEAVE GOD OUT OF HIS THANKSGIVING  ADDRESS, HE DIDN'T EVEN DO THAT. HE LEFT IT IN HIS THANKSGIVING ADDRESS JUST NOT THE ONE ON YOU-TUBE. AND FOR SOME REASON THAT DIDN'T STOP FOX FROM DISSECTING IT ON NO FEWER THAN  THREE OF ITS SHOWS INCLUDING AT ONE POINT BRINGING IN A PRIEST SO YOU COULD FIND OUT  WHAT GOD THINKS ABOUT ALL THIS.
HE SAYS THAT LIKE MUCH OF AMERICA, HE'S GOING TO SPEND HIS THANKSGIVING DAY EATING  LOTS OF GOOD FOOD, WATCHING SOME FOOTBALL, AND REFLECTING ON HOW LUCKY WE ARE. IT'S TAKING TIME TO REFLECT ABOUT THE WONDERFUL BLESSINGS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO US.
Jon: JOKE'S ON YOU. PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WHAT A PRIEST TELLS HIM. HE'S A MUSLIM. ( APPLAUSE ) LOOK, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THIS IS ABOUT TURNING THANKSGIVING INTO ANOTHER CHRISTIAN PERSECUTION CULTURE WAR TYPE THINGS. DON'T YOU DO IT. DON'T YOU DO THAT TO THANKSGIVING. I'LL GIVE YOU THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS. WE ARE (BEEP). I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. THIS IS ALL JEWS HAVE LEFT. THANKSGIVING IS MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY. NAME ANOTHER HOLIDAY WHERE YOU CAN GET DRUNK AROUND YOUR KIDS BY 2:00 p.m. YOU CAN'T. FOURTH OF JULY, YOU CAN'T DO IT THERE. YOU HAVE TO PACE YOURSELF FOR THE FIREWORKS. THANKSGIVING THE WHOLE THING IS OVER BY 5:00 p.m. YOU PASS OUT ON THE COUCH TALKING ABOUT THE RETURN OF THE LINEBACKER. THAT'S THE THANKSGIVING WE IT'S THE ONE HOLIDAY WHERE EVERYONE CAN JUST RELAX UNTIL NOW. TURNS IT INTO A EXCUSE AN OF (BEEP) LIKE THIS.
I LIKE TO START OFF BY MAY... IF I MAY, UNLIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO FAILED TO  MENTION GOD DURING HIS THANKSGIVING DAY PROCLAMATION, I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO SAY I THANK MY LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST FOR ANOTHER DAY OF  FREEDOM IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
Jon: WHEN DID FOX BECOME THE 700 CLUB? YOU KNOW WHAT? (BEEP). LET'S JUST WATCH THE PANDAS FOR THE REST OF THE SHOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
