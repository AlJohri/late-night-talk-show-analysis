(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK! AS YOU KNOW, FEBRUARY IS BLACK HISTORY MONTH. BUT SOME GROUPS... REALLY? WHOO? ALL RIGHT. SOME GROUPS DON'T GET THEIR OWN MONTHS AND ACCORDING TO WYATT CENAC, THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE. HE FILED THIS REPORT.
PITA. MANY DISMISS THE ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP BECAUSE OF ITS PUBLICITY STUNTS AND GRATUITOUS USE OF NUDITY. BUT WITH THEIR LATEST TACTIC THEY CAN FINALLY BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.
PETA IS SUING THE WORLD ON BEHALF OF FIVE ORCAS.
THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS THAT THE ORCAS AT THE PARK ARE SLAVES AND SHOULD BE FREED UNDER THE  13th AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION.
THAT'S RIGHT. FIVE OF SEAWORLD'S ORCAS ARE SLAVES WHO NEED TO BE LIBERATED JUST AS AFRICAN SLAVES WERE IN  1865 BY THE 13th AMENDMENT.
THIS IS A GROUND-BREAKING LAWSUIT. THE CONSTITUTION HAS NEVER BEEN APPLIED TO NONHUMAN ANIMALS. WHAT WE WANT TO SEE FOR THESE ORCAS IS WE WANT TO SEE THEM RELEASED TO THEIR FREEDOM.
IT KIND OF REMAINS ME OF THE OLD ORCA SPIRITUAL. (SINGING LIKE A WHALE)
YEAH. WELL, I GUESS... (SINGING LIKE A WHALE) (LAUGHTER)
TO COMPARE THEIR CONDITIONS TO THIS INCREDIBLE HORROR OF SLAVERY IN AMERICA IS BEYOND INSULTING. IT'S A CRUEL AND RACIST JOKE.
ELAINE BROWN SPENT THE '60s FIGHTING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. THE LEADER OF THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY. YET SHE OF ALL PEOPLE REFUSES TO GET ON BOARD THE WHALE FREEDOM TRAIN.
IF THERE IS ANIMAL CRUELTY, WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT CHECKING ANIMAL CRUELTY. BUT ANIMAL CRUELTY DOES NOT RISE TO SLAVERY. PART OF THE SLAVE CONDITION WAS THAT BLACKS WERE NOT REALLY HUMAN BEINGS.
YEAH. JUST LIKE WHALES. (LAUGHTER)
LET'S NOT GET IT TWISTED.
BUT IMAGINE HAVING TO DO WHAT SLAVES DID BUT DOING IT UNDERWATER. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, I'M GOING TO LET YOU SLIDE ON THAT ONE. THAT'S PRETTY... THAT'S PRETTY INSULTING.
ALL RIGHT. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT EVEN ELAINE COULDN'T DENY. WE NEED TO BE MORE COMPASSIONATE TOWARD ANIMALS.
EXACTLY.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE JUST EXPLOITING THE HISTORY OF  THE ENSLAVEMENT OF BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR PUBLICITY, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO BE WISE WITH OUR DECISIONS AND WHAT LAWSUITS TO FILE AND THIS IS A  SMART ONE AND WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL. WE NEED TO USE EVERY MEANS AVAILABLE TO US TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THEM.
SO YOU'RE THE FREEDOM RIDERS OF THE WHALE LIBERATION MOVEMENT?
I THINK THAT WE CAN CONSIDER PETA THE FREEDOM RIDERS OF THE WHALE LIBERATION MOVEMENT.
THIS WOMAN IS BLIND TO THE ISSUES OF BLACK PEOPLE.
SHE IS OUT THERE EVERYDAY ON THE FRONT LINES PUTTING UP ADS OF NAKED WHITE WOMEN ON BILLBOARDS.
SHE PHYSICALLY PUTTING THEM UP AND THEREFORE HER LIFE IS IN  JEOPARDY BECAUSE SHE'S ON A LADDER IN A BILLBOARD?
OH, GOD, NO. SHE'S PROBABLY HIRING SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO THAT.
SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HER LIFE IS IN JEOPARDY.
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO DEAL WITH PAM ANDERSON'S MANAGER? (LAUGHTER) THAT PERSON IS CRAZY!
YEAH, I FEEL HER PAIN.
ELAINE JUST COULDN'T RECOGNIZE ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT LEGAL STRATEGIES OF  MODERN TIMES.
BECAUSE THE 13th AMENDMENT DOESN'T USE THE WORD  "PERSON" OR "PEOPLE" IN ITS LANGUAGE WE'RE HOPING THAT A  COURT WILL SEE THAT IT CAN APPLY TO ANIMALS.
SHE WAS RIGHT. IF THE CONSTITUTION WAS WRITTEN FOR PEOPLE AND NOT FOR WHALES, IT WOULD STAY THAT SOMEWHERE. BUT PETA KNOW THIS IS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE ORCAS.
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT THINK BEYOND THIS CASE. I THINK THIS CASE COULD BE GROUND BREAKING FOR ALL ANIMALS AND WE'LL HOPEFULLY OPEN SOME  DOORS FOR A LOOK AT FUTURE LAWSUITS.
YES. THIS WAS ABOUT ALL THE ANIMALS, JUST LIKE IT SAID ON PETA'S WEB SITE. THE BIRD IN ITS CAGE, THE PIG IN ITS PEN, THE DOG IN ITS... WAIT, WHAT THE (BLEEP)? CAN YOU TELL ME WHO THIS IS?
THAT'S... WELL, THAT'S ME AND THAT'S MY DOG.
YOUR DOG?
SOPHIE.
SOPHIE. IS THAT HER REAL NAME OR HER SLAVE NAME? (LAUGHTER)
THAT IS THE NAME THAT I GAVE HER.
YOU'RE HER MASTER.
I'M HER COMPANION.
WHY SHOULD YOU BE ALLOWED TO HAVE A PET?
SOPHIE IS A DOMESTIC ANIMAL AND NEEDS TO BE IN A HOME.
SHE STAYS IN A HOUSE. THAT'S NOT WHERE DOGS GO.
DOMESTIC ANIMALS DO...
DO YOU EVER PUT HER ON A LEASH?
FOR HER SAFETY I PUT MY DOG ON A LEASH...
THE LEASH IS FOR HER SAFE ANY.
FOR DOMESTIC DOGS AND CATS AND DEPENDING ON THE INDIVIDUAL THEIR NEEDS ARE VERY DIFFERENT.
SO ORCAS ARE LIKE FIELD NIGGERS AND DOGS AND CATS ARE THE HOUSE NIGGERS? (LAUGHTER) MAYBE LISA COULD LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHEN IT CAME TO HER DOG. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE COUNTLESS EXPLOITED CREATURES FEATURED IN PETA'S CALENDARS AND POSTERS? SOMEONE HAD TO ACT ON BEHALF OF THE ANIMALS SO I CALLED MY LAWYER.
I'M HEREBY SERVING WITH YOU A COMPLAINT. IT ALLEGES THAT PETA USES THE IMAGES OF SOME ANIMALS WITHOUT HAVING FIRST OBTAINED THEIR  CONSENT AND WITHOUT ANY PAY OF ANY KIND.
YOU'RE BASICALLY BEING SERVED ON BEHALF OF ALL THE ANIMALS FOR  ROYALTIES AND BACK PAY OF $50 MILLION. WHICH EVEN SHE ACKNOWLEDGES IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY.
WELL, YEAH. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO THINK BEYOND THIS LAWSUIT. IT'S A GOOD THING.
AND IT TURNS OUT PETA WILL HAVE TO LOOK WELL BEYOND THEIR LAWSUIT SINCE A CALIFORNIA  DISTRICT JUDGE THREW OUT THE CASE. WHILE THEY VOW TO CONTINUE THEIR FIGHT, I'LL CONTINUE MY FIGHT  FOR THE ANIMALS USING EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED. (APPLAUSE). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
