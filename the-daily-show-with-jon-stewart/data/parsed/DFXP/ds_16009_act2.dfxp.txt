(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. A LITTLE EXTRA EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR. IF YOU SENSE A LITTLE EXTRA EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR, A LITTLE TINGLING IN THE  EXTREMITIES PROBABLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE RNC GATHERED ON FRIDAY TO CAST THEIR  BALLOTS FOR A NEW PARTY CHAIR. FIVE CANDIDATE VYING FOR THE JOB AMONG THEM MICHAEL STEEL THAT IS KNOWN FOR HIS STRONG  OPINIONS AND FOR HIS DISTRICT TIFF STREET STYLE.
MY STYLE IS MORE GRASS ROOTS ORIENTED. I'M MUCH MORE OF A STREET GUY. IN THE NORTHEAST I WEAR MY HATS BACKWARDS. THAT'S HOW WE ROLL IN THE NORTHEAST.
Jon: DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE NORTHEAST RICH MARITIME TRADITION. SCRIMSHAW. A LONG SHOT FOR RE-ELECTION. EVEN DURING HIS OPENING ADDRESS-- KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT. EVEN DURING HIS OPENING ADDRESS THERE WERE SIGNS IT WOULDN'T BE MICHAEL STEELE'S DAY.
YOU HAVE ALL PROVEN AND SHOWN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A GOOD PARTY. AND IT IS READY... (LAUGHING).
Jon: (BEEP) MAGNETS. BY THE WAY, WHAT WAS THE LOGO UNDERNEATH THE RNC SEAL? I'M BEING TOLD THAT IT'S THE LOGO OF THE HOTEL WHERE THEY HELD THE VOTES WHICH IS THE  GAYLORD NATIONAL. THE LOGO IS A FLAMING G. I AM NOT THE RNC CHAIRMAN. I AM LORD OF GAY. THE VOTING TOOK ALL AFTERNOON GOING THROUGH SEVEN ROUNDS OF BALLOTING BUT BY THE FOURTH  ROUND IT WAS CLEAR STEELE COULD NOT WIN SO HE GRACEFULLY CONCEDED.
I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE. AND NOW I EXIT STAGE RIGHT.
Jon: WOW. EXIT STAGE RIGHT. SO MANY GREAT REPUBLICANS HE COULD HAVE QUOTED, REAGAN, LINCOLN AND HE GOES WITH SNAGAL PUSS. EXIT STAGE RIGHT. HEAVENS TO MERGUTROID.
I AT THIS TIME I RELEASE MY SUPPORTERS. AND I ASK THEM TO STAND WITH ME IN SUPPORTING MARIA AS NEXT CHAIRMAN OF THE CAUCUS.
Jon: AN ENDORSEMENT EVEN IN DEFEAT ALLOWING STEELE TO LEAVE HIS MARK TO HELP SHAPE  THE PARTY'S FUTURE. MY GUESS IT'S CLEAR WHO IS GOING TO WIN.
ON THE 7th BALLOT ROOIS REINCE PRIEBUS WON. HE'S THE NEW REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN.
Jon: NAILED IT. MICHAEL STEELE EXIT. WISCONSIN STATE PARTY CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS ENTER. YOU CAN'T SPELL PUBIC RE-RINSE WITHOUT REINCE PRIEBUS. NOW SOME OF YOU AT HOME MAY BE SAYING WHAT IS A REINCE PRIEBUS. SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD FIND IN AN IKEA CATALOGUE. AND YOU WOULD BE RIGHT. FUN FACT. AT NIGHT REINCE PRIEBUS TURNS INTO A BED. OF COURSE, WE ARE SADDENED TO SEE MICHAEL STEELE'S TENURE COME TO AN END AS HIS NUMEROUS  NON-APPEARANCES ON THIS PROGRAM CEMENTED HIS ROLE AS A GREAT FRIEND TO OUR PROGRAM.
LUNCH MEAT. THAT'S WHAT I SAID SUGAR BREAD. LIKE A DRIBBLE.
Jon: YES, IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS ONLYIESTER-BIBBLE. FOR HIS REACTION TO BEING VOTED OUT WE CHECK IN ONE LAST TIME WITH MICHAEL STEELE. HE JOINS US LIVE FROM HIS HOME OFFICE IN UPPER MARBLEBORO MARYLAND. WELCOME, MR. STEELE.
AS THE GREAT ALBERT SWITSER ONCE SAID THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE IS WHAT DIES INSIDE A MAN  WHILE HE LIVES. NOW AS I FIND MYSELF PERCHED ON THE PRECIPICE OF A NEW LIFE, I FIND MYSELF ASKING, HOW MUCH OF ME STILL LIVES AND IS IT ENOUGH TO CARRY ON?
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE, MEL ROSE PLACE.
Jon: YOU GOT ME.
I DID MORE THAN GET YOU. YOU GOT DUPED LIKE HEARTY SOUP.
Jon: GOOD TO SEE YOU. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF YOUR SUCCESSOR REINCE PRIEBUS?
REINCE PRIEBUS. HIS NAME MAKES NO SENSE. IT'S JIBILRISH. WHO IS HIS MOM? JODY FOSTER'S CHARACTER?
Jon: WOW. THAT'S A DEEP CUT.
YEAH, I SAID IT.
Jon: HIS NAME IS KIND OF FUNNY.
NOT HALF AS FUNNY AS HIS FACE. LOOK AT HIM. THIS GUY LOOKS LIKE ZIGGY AFTER HALF A CAN OF ROGAINE.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE ANY SUBSTANTIVE TO SAY ABOUT REINCE PRIEBUS?
I'M NOT SAYING HE'S A DICK FROM WISCONSIN BUT BRETT FARVE  JUST TEXTED ME HIS PICTURE.
Jon: HE SEEMS LIKE A NICE FELLOW. VERY NORMAL. WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU NOW THAT YOU'RE NO LONGER CHAIRMAN OF THE RNC?
JOHN, I SPENT MONEY THAT DIDN'T BELONG TO ME ON LESBIAN STRIPPERS. I LEFT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY $20 MILLION IN DEBT WITH VIRTUALLY NO ACCOUNTABILITY. I'D SAY IT'S TIME FOR ME TO HEAD BACK TO THE STREETS. WALL STREET. MAKE YOUR WAY, FRASER CRANE. IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FORMER RNC CHAIRMAN, MICHAEL
