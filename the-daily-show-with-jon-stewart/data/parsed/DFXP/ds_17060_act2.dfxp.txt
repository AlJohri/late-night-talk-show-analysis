Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, YOU MAY HAVE HEARD NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NOW IS IN THE GRIPS OF LIN-SANITY. IT'S GRIPPING THE CITY. THIS HAS A DARK SIDE AS AASIF MANDVI ORTS IN THIS EDITION OF LIN-DECISION 2012.
JEREMY LIN. HE'S A HERO TO BOTH NEW YORKERS AND ASIANS EVERYWHERE. YET SIDELY MANY CHINESE AND TAIWAN HE'S FANS ARE PREVENTED FROM SEEING JEREMY LIN PLAY  DUE TO MEDIA CENSORSHIP. I WENT TO WITNESS THESE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES FIRSTHAND UNDER THE IRON GRIP OF TOTALITARIAN  RULE THE STREETS WERE FILLED WITH WARY GLANCES, SUSPICION AND FEAR. A BRAVE FEW WERE WILLING TO PUT THEIR LIVES IN DANGER BY SPEAKING TO ME. IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M SURPRISED HERE IN CHINA YOU WOULD SPEAK ENGLISH THAT WELL.
THIS IS CHINATOWN.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I TOOK A PLANE HERE.
Reporter: IRONICALLY WHILE TELEVISION VIEWERS IN CHINA AND TAIWAN CAN SEE JEREMY LIN  VIEWERS IN NEW YORK'S CHINATOWN CANNOT.
BLACKED OUT ON TIME WARNER FOR SEVEN WEEKS.
THERE HAVE BEEN NO MEANINGFUL DECISIONS BETWEEN TIME WARNER CABLE....
TWO MILLION PEOPLE CAN'T SEE THE KNICKS PLAY.
Reporter: ONE CHINATOWN RESIDENT DESCRIBED THE OPPRESSIVE LIVING CONDITIONS  HE IS FORCED TO ENDURE.
IN MY BUILDING WE CAN'T GET DIRECT TV OR ANY OTHER SERVICE LIKE VERIZON. I JUST FEEL LIKE A PRISONER. I CAN'T WATCH JEREMY LIN PLAY.
TIME WARNER COMES WITHOUT MSG. SOMETIMES I SEE IT WRITTEN IN THE MENU. BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS... YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW.
I'M PRETTY SURE NO MSG.
Reporter: IT HAS FORCED PEOPLE TO RISK THEIR LIVES JUST TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE LIN-SANITY.
HE'S BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO LEAD US. JEREMY LIN AGAINST THE DIRECT ORDERS OF TIME WARNER.
Reporter: THEY CRAMMED TOGETHER WATCHING A SMOTHERED SIGNAL IN AN UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT. AND TO THINK THIS WAS HAPPENING IN AMERICA. I KNEW I HAD TO TRY TO HELP THEM. SO IT SEEMED FEW TILE AGAINST SUCH A POWERFUL AND FAR-REACHING ORGANIZATION.O1FMa  MAYBE I COULD REASON WITH TIME WARNER. SO I CALLED THEM AND SET UP AN INTERVIEW. I WAITED AFTERNOON WAITED.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? COME ON! OH, MAN!
WITH ALL THE LIN-SANITY CONSUMING THE LAND, IT WAS LIN- CONCEIVEABLE THAT TIME WARNER  WOULD KEEP THE MOST LIN-CREDIBLE STORY IN THE LIN-BA.
DO YOU THINK THIS WILL KEEP PROLONGING THE ISSUE.
I'M HOPING THEY WILL RESOLVE IT SOON JOORT SHE WONKFULLY TOOK HIM AWAY FROM YOU.
YOU COULD SAY THAT.
Reporter: IS THAT MAKING YOU WONK... DAMN. THIS IS REALLY HARD. LIN IS A MUCH EASIER NAME. AMAZINGLY WHILE WE WERE TAPING THIS STORY, A MIRACLE OCCURRED.
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" AT LEAST IS REPORTING THAT THERE IS A DEAL. THEY HAVE RESOLVED THE DISPUTE AND THEY WILL HEAR ABOUT IT AT SOME POINT TODAY.
OH, MY GOD.
Reporter: AWESOME. THE CONFLICT WAS RESOLVED. BUT THE VICTIMS OF THIS ABUSE WILL NEVER FORGET THE PAIN AND INDIGNITY THEY'VE BEEN FORCED  TO LIVE THROUGH. HE CHOSE TO EXPRESS HIS SENTIMENTS ABOUT TIME WARNER WITH A POEM IN HIS NATIVE TIME.
TIME WARNER.
Reporter: THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
(BEEP), (BEEP). (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
