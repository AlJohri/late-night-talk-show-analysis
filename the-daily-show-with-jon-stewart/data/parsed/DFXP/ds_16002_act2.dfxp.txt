[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. IF WE HAVEN'T SAID IT BEFORE, HAPPY NEW YEAR, EVERYBODY. JUST IN TIME. 2010 OVERSTAYED ITS WELCOME. GOOD RIDDANCE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAY SOMETHING IN YOU KNOW WHAT  IT WAS LIKE THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE ISLAMIC CENTER IN LOWER MANHATTAN, THE BATTLE OVER  ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND, OF COURSE, THE HEALTH DARE DEBATE. THAT WAS LAST YEAR. THIS IS 2011 AND THE TIMES THEY ARE ACHANGE-ING.
CONGRESSMAN PETER KING OF NEW YORK IS PROPOSING HEARINGS TO DISCUSS THE RADICALIZATION OF  MUSLIMS IN THIS COUNTRY.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THE REGULATION OF GREENHOUSE GASES.
OBAMA CARE WILL BANKRUPT THE COUNTRY.
Jon: THESE ARE THE SAME THINGS AS LAST YEAR. IT ISN'T REALLY A NEW YEAR, MORE OF A SEQUEL TO LAST YEAR. IT'S NOT 2011 IT'S -- ♪ ♪ SORRY. I THINK WE JUST ENDED UP KILLING A BUNCH OF BIRDS OVER ARKANSAS. [LAUGHTER] SO IN 2010 THE BATTLE TO STOP THE ISLAM CENTER IS THE MUSLIMS TAKE MANHATTAN AND WHAT WILL THE  SEQUEL BE.
FOR WHATEVER REASON THE MUSLIM LEADERS ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE EXTENT OF THE RAL CALLIZATION IT.
ARE YOU GOING TO NAME NAMES?
WE'LL DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.
Jon: A CONGRESSMAN IS GOING TO NAME NAMES IN WHAT HE CONSIDERS UNAMERICAN ACTIVITIES. WHAT COULD GO SFWLONG. [LAUGHTER] HE UNDERSTANDS THE CONCEPT. YOU TAKE THE PREMISES AND GIVE IT A -- PREMISE AND GIVE IT A TWIST. WE UNDERSTAND IT FROM LAST YEAR.
WE NEED TO BE ALL ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY I OPPOSE OBAMA CARE.
Jon: OBAMA CARE HEALTH RAISER. THE HORROR MOVIE. THE BILL PASSED. WHAT DO THEY COME U+T WITH THIS YEAR?
WE'LL PUT FORTH A REPEAL OF OBAMA CARE.
Jon: A REPEAL. THAT'S LIKE RUNNING THE ORIGINAL MOVIE IN REVERSE. NO ONE WILL PAY TO SEE THAT. THIS CONGRESSMAN HATES THIS PRESIDENT AND WOULDN'T MINCE HIS WORDS.
GO TO THE ACRIMONIOUS THERE'S NO QUESTION:  HE HAS BEEN ONE OF  THE MOST CORRUPT PRESIDENTS IN MODERN TIMES.
Jon: OH, SNAP! SO HE IS IN CHARGE. HE IS GOING TO BE MAGNUM|ï¿½ P.ISA. HE'S GOING TO BE BAD ASS ASSUMING HE STILL STANDS BY WHAT HE SAID TO RUSH.
I CORRECTED WHAT I MEANT TO SAY. ON LIVE RADIO WITH RUSH GOING BACK AND FORTH. BY THE WAY, THAT WAS BECAUSE RUSH HAD ME ON TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT COMING TOGETHER, HAVING COMPROMISE. HE DIDN'T LIKE THE COMPROMISE WORD WHEN I SAID WE'RE GOING TO  AGREE TO DISAGREE AND THEN FIND COMMON GROUND, THE KIND OF COMPROMISE THAT MAKES AND GETS  THINGS DONE. JOMPL I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THAT. IT'S LIKE I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING TO
