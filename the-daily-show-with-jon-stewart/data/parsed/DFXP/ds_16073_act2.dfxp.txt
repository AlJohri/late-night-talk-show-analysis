(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. WE'RE DISCUSSING THE ISSUES OF THE DAY, SEX SCANDAL AND HEALTH CARE ISSUES. FOR MORE, THOUGH ON THE SEX SCANDAL, THIS BRAVE NEW WORLD OF PENIS-BASED MESSAGING, WE'RE  JOINED BY SENIOR WOMEN'S ISSUES CORRESPONDENT KRISTEN SCHAAL. KRISTEN, WELCOME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) KRISTEN, RECENTLY WE'VE SEEN SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE MALE ORGANS  LEAKED ON THE INTERNET. (LAUGHTER) CHRIS BROWN'S, BRETT FAVRE, NOW CONGRESSMAN WEINER. DEVIANT? DISGUSTING? WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THIS RASH OF PENIS PHOTOS?
WELL, JON, I MEAN, IT DEPENDS. SOMETIMES MY REACTION IS (GASPS) AND THEN OTHER TIMES IT'S (OH, MY GOD) AND SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE... (LAUGHTER). BRAVO, SIR. BRAVO.
Jon: RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE ISSUE BEHIND ALL THIS?
WELL, JON, SENDING PHOTOS OF YOUR PENIS CRAZE CAN BE CHALKED  UP TO AN AGE-OLD MISCONCEPTION THAT WOMEN WANT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PENIS. (LAUGHTER) AND THAT SEEING IT WILL MAKE YOU MORE ATTRACTIVE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO... SO THAT IS NOT THE CASE?
NO. NO. MEN NEED TO REALIZE THEIR PENIS HAS FAR MORE POWER OVER THEM THAN IT DOES OVER US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IF YOU'RE A SEVEN-TERM CONGRESSMAN AND A WOMAN STILL  ISN'T INTO YOU, SHOWING HER YOUR PENIS ISN'T GOING TO CLOSE THE DEAL. (LAUGHTER) OR IN BRETT FAVRE'S CASE, IF THIS PICTURE DOESN'T WIN HER  HEART, THIS ONE'S NOT GONNA HELP (AUDIENCE REACTS) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOW MY EYES ARE BLEEDING. (LAUGHTER) KRISTEN, TO BE FAIR, THOUGH, SOMETIMES WOMEN SEND MEN RISQUE PHOTOS AS WELL.
WELL, BECAUSE THE FEMALE BODY IS BEAUTIFUL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT IS TRUE.
YES.
Jon: AND PENISES LOOK LIKE A SPECIES DISCOVERED LIVING ON THE OCEAN FLOOR NEAR UNDERSEA  SULFUR BEDS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. SO OVERALL, YOU'D THEY THE MALE URGE TO SHARE VISUAL PENIS INFORMATION HAS HAD A NEGATIVE AFFECT?
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL. IN FACT, IT'S BEEN THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND CENTURIES OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, DID YOU KNOW THE LIGHTBULB WAS FIRST CONCEIVED AS THE PENIS LAMP? BECAUSE THOMAS EDISON REALIZED THERE WERE 12 HOURS OF EVERY DAY WHEN WOMEN COULDN'T SEE HIS PENIS. (LAUGHTER) AND SOON AFTER THAT CAME THE PENIS PHONE.
Jon: YOU MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, THE TELEPHONE.
YES, AS IT'S KNOWN NOW, OKAY. (LAUGHTER) WE ALL REMEMBER ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL'S FIRST CALL. "WATSON, COME HERE, I WANT TO SEE YOU." RIGHT?
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEARD WHAT CAME BEFORE THAT.
HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M LOOKING AT MY PENIS RIGHT NOW. IT'S LIKE THE HEAD OF A ONE-EYED VULTURE SITTING ON A WRINKLED BEANBAG CHAIR. NO, NO. IT'S MORE LIKE A PINK TOADSTOOL GARNISHED WITH SHAVED COCONUT. I'M NOT DOING IT JUSTICE. MR. WATSON, COME HERE, I WANT TO SEE YOU! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU, A VULTURE? HAVE A HEARD THAT CORRECTLY? A VULTURE ON A BEANBAG CHAIR?
JON, NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BE INSECURE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SO THERE'S NO SITUATION WHERE A WOMAN WOULD ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE PREVIEW  OR SNEAK PEEK OF A MAN... NOT UNLESS IT'S BARBED LIKE A TOMCATS. (LAUGHTER) OR COVERED IN RACIST PRISON AT TATTOOS. IN THAT CASE YOU MAY WANT TO GIVE US A HEADS-UP. (LAUGHTER) BUT IF AFTER HEARING ALL OF THIS YOU STILL WANT TO SEND A PHOTO  OF YOUR PENIS, MAKE SURE IT HIGHLIGHTS THE QUALITIES WOMEN ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR. WOMEN WANT A PENIS THAT'S A GOOD LISTENER. (LAUGHTER) THAT WE CAN TAKE HOME TO OUR PARENTS. (LAUGHTER) A PENIS THAT'S PROTECTIVE YET NURTURING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT WAS AN IMPRESSIVE PENIS.
I KNOW!
Jon: KRISTEN SCHAAL, EVERY
