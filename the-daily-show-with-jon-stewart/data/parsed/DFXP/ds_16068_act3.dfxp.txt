Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM LISA P JACKSON. WELCOME TO YOU AGAIN. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: VERY NICE TO SEE YOU. I GOT YOU SOME WATER. I WANT YOU TO RELAX. THE EPA, YOU GUYS ARE IN A REAL DOGFIGHT NOW THAT THE NEW CONGRESS HAS TAKEN OVER. FOR SOME REASON THEY FEEL THAT THE EPA IS THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SET  FOR GOVERNMENT OVERREACH, IF YOU WILL.
YUP, I CERTAINLY HEARD THAT. WE HEAR THINGS LIKE DEFUND THE EPA, THE SCARIEST AGENCY IN GOVERNMENT. WE WONDER WHERE SOME OF THAT IS COMING FROM. BUT IT'S DEFINITELY AN INSIDE THE BELTWAY MIND OF REASONING.
Jon: I CAN TELL ARE YOU WHERE IT IS COMING FROM, ACTUALLY. I ACTUALLY SEE THEM ON C PAC, IT IS CALLED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE, YOU KNOW, GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY  WOULD ARGUE THAT IT ISN'T AT TIMES BUREAUCRATIC, BURDENSOME, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. BUT THE EPA HAS, FOR A GOVERNMENT AGENCY, A RELATIVELY GOOD TRACK RECORD, CLEAN AIR ACT, CLEAN WATER ACT. THOSE SEEM TO BE UNASSAILABLE SUCCESSES. ARE THERE PEOPLE THAT ARGUE THAT THOSE AREN'T GOOD PROGRAMS?
I THINK THERE ARE. I THINK THAT HAPPENS FROM TIME TO TIME. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EPA, FOUNDED IN 1970 UNDER A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. ACTS THAT CAME ALONG WITH T THE CLEAN AIR ACT YOU MENTIONED, THE CLEAN WATER  ACT, SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT, SUPERFUND, ALL ALMOST ENTIRELY BIPARTISAN ACTS, OFTENTIMES UNANIMOUS. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE ARE DOING OUR JOB UNDER THIS  PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO REMIND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT ENVIRONMENTALISM ISN'T A  SPECTATOR SPORT. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO STAND UP AND DEMAND THAT WE BE VIGILANT IN PROTECTING OUR AIR AND WATER.
Jon: THE ARGUMENT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT PEOPLE ENJOY AIR AND WATER. THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE THAT THE EPA CANNOT DO THAT WITHOUT KILLING BUSINESS OR KILLING JOBS. THAT TO KEEP, LET'S SAY DIOXIN FROM KILLING US, WE MUST KILL THE FACTORY. IS THERE A HAPPY MEDIUM? CAN WE NOT DIE BUT ALSO THEY LIVE?
WE CAN--  (LAUGHTER)
WE CAN HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY AND A STRONG AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. WE CAN HAVE CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER. AND IN FACT, AS EVIDENCE OF THAT. THERE IS EVIDENCE IN THE LAST 40 YEARS THAT THE AIR IS 60% CLEANER WHILE OUR GDP  WAS UP 207% OVER THAT PERIOD.
Jon: IS THIS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE BECAUSE I DON'T-- I-- I FIND THAT  THOSE TYPES OF FACTS ARE VERY UNPERSUASIVE. (LAUGHTER)
WHAT WOULD PERSUADE YOU.
Jon: A FEELING. (LAUGHTER) A FEELING THAT IT WASN'T RIGHT OR WORKING.
WELL-- .
Jon: TO THE POINT, SO YOU'RE TRYING TO REGULATE MERCURY. AND THEY SAY THIS COULD PREVENT THOUSANDS OF DEATHS.
UH-HUH.
Jon: AND WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT AGAINST THAT?
WELL, I'VE HEARD ARGUMENTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO KILL JOBS. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MERCURY, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE MERCURY IN AIR, TOXIC  STANDARDS THAT WE ANNOUNCED TWO MONTHS AGO. FIRST OFF, 21 YEARS IN THE MAKING. THESE ARE STANDARDS THAT WERE CALLED FOR IN 1990.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DID SOME, THEY WERE THROWN OUT BY THE COURT BECAUSE  THEY WERE TRADING MERCURY AND NO ONE WANTED TO BE ON THE LOSING END OF THAT TRADE, RIGHT. MERCURY IS A NEUROTOXIN, IT DESTROYS OUR CHILDREN'S BRAINS, OFTENTIMES BEFORE  THEY'RE BORN. THESE STANDARDS ARE ESTIMATED TO PREVENT 17,000 PREMATURE DEATHS EACH YEAR, PREVENT 11,000 HEART ATTACKS EACH YEAR, AND HALF OF THE POWER PLANTS IN OUR COUNTRY  ALREADY HAVE CONTROLS FOR MERCURY AND ARSENIC AND THE DIOXINS IN PARTICULAR MATTER  THAT YOU GET TO CONTROL ALONG WITH IT. THE ONLY THING WE HEAR IS IT CAN'T BE DONE. AND EVERYTHING WE KNOW AND EVERY MODEL THAT WE RUN SHOWS THAT IT ABSOLUTELY CAN BE DONE. AND THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY CREATE JOBS. SOMEONE HAS TO BUILD ALL THOSE SCRUBBERS AND FILTERS THAT DEAL WITH MERCURY.
Jon: SO YOU GOT THAT ONE THROUGH. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER ONE, MERCURY AND DIOXIN THAT YOU HAD TO PULL, WHAT IS THAT ONE?
SO THE MERCURY FOR THE UTILITY AND POWER PLANTS HAS BEEN PROPOSED. IT'S NOT THROUGH YET BUT WE INTEND TO FINALIZE IT. WE ALSO PROPOSED A MERCURY AND AIR TOXIC STANDARD FOR BOILERS. THESE ARE EVERYTHING FROM SCHOOLS TO FACTORIES USE COAL AND BURN IT TO MAKE POWER. THOSE STANDARDS ARE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE ARE YOU COVERING A SECRETARY  THEIR IS MUCH LARGER, IT IS NOT JUST POWER PLANTS, IT'S EVERYTHING. SO WE JUST RECENTLY WERE REQUESTED, WE PETITIONED TO RECONSIDER THE RULE. WE AGREED TO DO THAT AND TO STAY IT FOR A VERY LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME. WE'LL BE ANNOUNCING A SCHEDULE SOON BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE RULE. I KNOW PEOPLE ARE WORRIED. WE WILL FINALIZE THAT RULE BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT.
Jon: WHAT IS THE POLITICAL PRESSURE LIKE IN WASHINGTON TO NOT HAVE THESE RULES. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS, THERE IS AN EPIC BATTLE OCCURRING BENEATH THE  SURFACE, ONE OF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CORPORATE MONEY, PREVENTING THESE TYPES OF RULES FROM GOING INTO EFFECT. WHAT THE IS THE TYPE OF PRESSURE THAT YOU FACE. LOBBYISTS, PHONE CALLSES, AT NIGHT YOU GET, LET'S SAY, A TUNA HEAD IN YOUR BED BECAUSE --
FULL OF MERCURY.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WHAT IS THE ISSUES THAT YOU FACE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, FIRST I WAS TOLD I WOULD HAVE A PARKING PLACE ON CAPITOL HILL. AND I HAVE TESTIFIED MORE TIMES IN THIS CONGRESS THAN ANY OTHER CABINET MEMBER. INCLUDING PEOPLE LIKE KATHLEEN SEBELIUS WHO IS IN CHARGE OF HEALTH CARE FOR THIS COUNTRY OR JANET  NAPOLITANO WHO DOES HOMELAND SECURITY. SO THERE IS A LOT OF-- AROUND IT. SOME OF THESE HEARINGS HAVE PRETTY INTIMIDATING NAMES. I DON'T MIND GOING UP THERE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EXPLAIN TO THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE, THIS SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING UNDER THE SURFACE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOUR CONGRESS PUT MORE RIDERS ON THE EPA THAN ANY OTHER AGENCY.
Jon: HOW DO YOU NOT-- THE ABILITY OF, YOU KNOW, WE'RE  WE'RE-- YOU CAN STAY FOR TWO MINUTES.
YES, I CAN.
Jon: WE'RE GOING TO THROW TO COMMERCIAL AND WE'LL KEEP  YOU FOR FIVE MINUTES BECAUSE I KNOW OBVIOUSLY I SAW ON THE BACK YOU HAVE A HUGE TUB  OF MERCURY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTING. LISA P JACKSON, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
