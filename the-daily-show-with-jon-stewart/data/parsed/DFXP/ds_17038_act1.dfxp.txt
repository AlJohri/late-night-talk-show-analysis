JANUARY 4, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HI, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. WHAT A WONDERFUL DISPLAY OF ENTHUSIASM. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, AUTHOR ELIZABETH DOWLING TAYLOR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NICE. WOW. SUCH HARD NAME TO PRONOUNCE. OBVIOUSLY TONIGHT WE'LL BE DEALING WITH IOWA AND OUR UP-TO-THE-MINUTE COVERAGE OF ALL  THE [BLEEPED] YOU ALREADY KNOW. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, I REASON THE FIRST ONE TO EXPRESS HOW ON SERDLY OVERCOVERED THE IOWA CAUCUSES ARE. IT'S ONE POLL WIDELY UNREPRESENTATIVE OF AMERICANS. THAT BEING SAID, WATCHING IOWANS STUFF HAND-WRITTEN BALLOTS INTO REPURPOSEED GIFT BOXES AS TO  NEUTRALIZE ANY EAST COAST BIG CITY ELITIST SMEAR, I WOULD LIKE THE DRIZZLE ALL OVER IT LIKE  RASPBERRY BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE. I WANT TO [BLEEPED] ON THIS, BUT IT'S KIND OF BEAUTIFUL. THE ENTIRE IOWA PROCESS SEEMS LIKE AN HISTORICAL RE-ENACTMENT ABYET SHOCKS YOU CAN ITS SIMPLICITY. YOU'RE FLOODED WITH A BYGONE ERA. IT'S LIKE WALKING INTO A HOUSE AND THEY'VE GOT A FIRE GOING IN  THIS WEIRD PIT AND THEY'RE LIKE, WHAT'S THAT. AND THEY'RE LIKE, IT'S BOOED, BUT IT'S BURNING. THE FIREPLACE. BUT WHERE ARE THE GAS JETS OR THE REMOTE. I REALLY THINK THE IOWA CAUCUSES ARE ONE OF THE FEW EVENTS IN OUR CIVIC LIFE WHERE IT WOULD BE  INDESTRUCTIVE TO ALLOW IT TO PLAY OUT IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS BECAUSE IT GIVES US A DEEPER  UNDERSTANDING TO OUR CONNECTION TO OUR DEMOCRACY. HOW DO YOU THINK CNN WILL  [BLEEPED] THAT UP.
CHECK OUT THESE LITTLE GUYS. IMAGINE THEY'RE IOWA REPUBLICANS SHOWING UP FOR CAUCUSES. THAT'S A REPRESENTATIVE OF MITT ROMNEY. HE'S GOING TO THE FRONT OF THE ROOM TO PROMOTE HIS CANDIDATE. THE CAUCUSGOERS GET A CHANCE TO VOTE. THEY CAN WRITE IT DOWN OP A PIECE OF PAPER.
THEY HAVE A TELEPHONE. THEY CAN CALL AND GIVE THE RESULTS OF THAT CAUCUS.
Jon: WHY! WHY? WHY! THERE ARE ROOMS IN 9 9 COUNTIES IN IOWA DEMONSTRATING THE REAL THING AND YOU HAVE CAMERAS, WHY  THIS MULTICOLORED FEATURELESS DILDO PEOPLE? [LAUGHTER] FOR GOD'S SAKE, THIS IS WHY PEOPLE... REALLY NOT THAT FOND OF CNN AT TIMES. AFTER SIX HOURS MOSTLY UNNECESSARY COVERAGE, ACTUAL CAUCUSES RESULTS TRICKLED IN. THE TWO BIGGEST WINNERS, MICHELE BACHMANN AND RICK PERRY, WHO CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF MY  FAVORITE CANDIDATES FOR HIS COME PROOTLY UNJUSTIFIED ENTHUSIASM IN THE FACE OF A FIFTH-PLACE ASS KICKING.
YEAH. YOU BET. YOU KIDS ARE AWESOME.
WE LOVE YOU, RICK.
ALL RIGHT. HEY, BROTHER. OH, MAN, THANK YOU, MAN. YOU AN RUTH WERE AWESOME. JON JON WHOOO. WHAT'S UP, EVERYBODY. I SPENT A [BLEEPED] LOAD OF MONEY IN IOWA, DIDN'T GET A WHOLE LOT OF VOTES. WHAT'S UP? I HAD A HELL OF A TIME. I THINK MY CAMPAIGN MIGHT BE DEAD IN THE WATER, BY OUR HOTEL IN DES MOINES WAS COOL AS  [BLEEPED]. THE FOOD WAS GREAT AND THE MAID FOLDED THE ENDS OF THE TOILET PAPER LIKE A FAN SHAPE. I FELT GUILTY WIPING MY HIND QUARTERS WITH IT TO BE HONEST. THIS PLACE PUTS THE RAD IN "RADISSON." BY THE WAY, I GOT CRUSHED. FOR MICHELE BACHMANN, HER SIXTH PLACE FINISH WAS REFLECTED IN HER SOMBER CONFESSION, BUT AS  ALWAYS, THERE WAS ONE SILVER LINING.
I MUST THANK MY WONDERFUL HUSBAND OF 33 YEARS MARCUS BACHMANN. AND YESTERDAY WHEN WE WERE OUT ON MAIN STREET IN DES MOINES, HE WAS BUYING DOGGIE SUNGLASSES FOR  OUR DOG BOOMER WHILE WE WERE OUT VISITING ALL OF THE MANY BUSINESSES. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: SERIOUSLY. LOOK AT THE FACE HE'S MAKING. THE ONLY SOUND YOU CAN MAKE WHEN YOUR MOUTH IS SHAPED THAT WAY IS  "HO OH," WHICH TRANSLATES TO "SORRY I RUINED YOUR CAMPAIGN  BECAUSE OF MY OBSESSION WITH DOG ACCESSORIES. ALTHOUGH NOTHING SAYS SIXTH-LACE FINISH LIKE DOG ACCESSORIES. TELL ME YOU'D RATHER BE PRESIDENT THAN LOOK AT THAT. YOU'D BE LYING. RON PAUL CAME IN THIRD. HE SEEMS LESS CONCERNED ABOUT HIS BRONZE MEDAL SHOWING AND IS MUCH HAPPIER THEY LET HIM SAY  STUFF LIKE THIS ON TELEVISION.
BEWARE THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. TIME TO GET OUT OF AFGHANISTAN. I'M WAITING FOR THE DAY WHEN WE CAN SAY WE'RE ALL AUSTRIANS NOW. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DID AN ENTIRE AUDIENCE AT AN IOWA HILTON JUST CHEER A REFERENCE TO AN AUSTRIAN ECONOMIST? WE HAD TO LOOK UP WHATEVER THE HELL HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S AWESOME. THIS CROWD, THEY JUST KNOW EVERYTHING. IT'S LIKE BEING AT A JIMMY BUFFETT SHOW WHERE [BLEEPED] IS  GOING ON AND YOU'RE LIKE, WHY IS EVERYBODY WEARING A PARROT ON YOUR HEAD. PEOPLE ARE HOLDING UP LIGHTERS, PLAY "ABOLISH THE FED." NEWT GINGRICH CAME IN FOURTH. THREE WEEKS AGO HE WAS IN THE LEAD UNTIL AN INTENSE SERIES OF NEGATIVE ADS FROM THE ROMNEY  SUPER PAC PUMMELED HIM, BUT I'M SURE HE WAS GRACIOUS ABOUT IT.
I WANT THE THANK EVERYBODY WHO WORKED ALL FALL, PARTICULARLY DURING THE AVALANCHE OF NEGATIVE ADS, ALL THROUGH BEING DROWNED IN TELLING  DIFFICULT, THE LATEST 30-SECOND DISTORTION. THE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GET AMERICA BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK. THEY WEREN'T MILLIONAIRES. THEY WEREN'T FROM WALL STREET. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SUPER PAC. THE MASSACHUSETTS MODERATE. I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TELL THE TRUTH. ON TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT WASN'T A CONCESSION SPEECH. THAT WAS LIKE A THINLY VEILED, PASSIVE AGRESSIVE SPEECH THAT A INDIVIDUAL MAKES RIGHT BEFORE THEY SLINK AWAY TO A  SKULL-SHAPED CAVE IN A VOLCANO AND REEMERGE IN FIVE YEARS AS SUPERVILLAIN VONN GINGRICH, THE  DARK LORD OF CHAOS WHOM IS LAUGHING NOW, ROMNEY? GENETICALLY SUPERCHARGED NEWT. OF COURSE, ROMNEY COULD AFFORD TO BE GRACIOUS. WELL, HE CAN AFFORD PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING. HOW EXPENSIVE CAN GRACIOUS BE? BUT I IMAGINE HIS EIGHT-VOTE VICTORY VALIDATES HIS STRATEGY TO SAY ANYTHING THAT WILL GIVE  HIM AN EIGHT-VOTE VICTORY. THE. I LOVE OUR FEESMEDZ I LOVE OUR CONSTITUTION. I LOVE OUR LAND. I LOVE OUR PEOPLE. I LOVE THE HYMNS OF AMERICA. AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL, OH BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES, FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN. AND ONE MORE VERSE LET ME JUST QUOTE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WOW, I'VE NEVER HEARD AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL SOUND LIKE  SOMETHING YOU WERE FORCED TO MEMORIZE AT EXETER. EVEN IN VICTORY MITT ROMNEY'S ORDINARY GUY PERSONA FEELS LIKE IT CAME FROM A COMMITTED PERSONA  ORDINARY GUY KIT HE GOT FROM HAMAKER SCHLEMMER FOR $14 MILLION. MR. SANTORUM, THE SURPRISE COFIRST PLACE FINISHER, SHOW ROMNEY HOW IT'S DONE.
I WEAVE FOUNDATIONALLY THAT THE ESSENTIAL ISSUE IN THIS RACE IS FREEDOM. MY GANN FARE TAUGHT ME BASIC THINGS THAT MY DAD TAUGHT ME. WORK HARD. WORK HARD AND WORK HARD. HE LEFT TO THE COAL FIELDS OF SOUTHWEST PENNSYLVANIA. HE CONTINUED TO WORK IN THOSE MINDS UNTIL HE WAS 72 YEARS OLD. DIGGING COAL. THOSE HANDS DUG FREEDOM FOR ME. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HEY, ROMNEY, FOLLOW THAT, [BLEEPED] FACE THAT. IS THE STUFF. OH, MY GOD, I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING FOR MITT ROMNEY, RICK SANTORUM IS THE ACTUAL GUY  ROMNEY IS PRETENDING TO BE. KUDOS TO SANTORUM. HE WORKED HARD. WE'VE HAD GOOD FUN HERE AT THE SHOW WITH HIS LAST NAME AND ITS PLACE IN GOOGLE HISTORY, BUT NO MORE. WE'RE NOT DOING IT ANYMORE. IN HONOR OF THE WELL-FOUGHT IOWA CAUCUS, I'M NOW GOING TO SHRED THE HOURS AND HOURS OF  HIGH-QUALITY, EMMY ELIGIBLE ASS JUICE JOKES THAT WE HAD PREPARED FOR HIM. HOLD ON. LET ME JUST... NEVER GOING TO DO THEM AGAIN NO MATTER HOW TEMPTING IT MAY BE TO USE SOME OF THEM.
IF YOU SCROLL DOWN, YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE COLORS OF THE COUNTIES, THE BROWN THERE IS  RICK SANTORUM. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE.
Jon: DOG WITH SUNGLASSES. DOG WITH SUNGLASSES. DOG WITH SUNGLASSES. FOR US THE BIT HAS RUB ITS COURSE. I VOW TO ONLY RIDICULE RICK SANTORUM FOR HIS ABSURD AND SOMETIMES VILE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL VIEWS. YOU'RE WELCOME.
