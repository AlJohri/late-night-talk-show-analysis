(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. HEY, DID YOU GUYS KNOW THAT IN ICELAND THEY BURY SHARK FOR A YEAR AND THEN THEY DIG IT UP AND  FORCE PEOPLE FROM NORWAY TO EAT IT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S THE NEXT IRON CHEF. LOOK, AS YOU KNOW, THIS SEASON IS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL SEASON OF DANCING WITH THE THE STARS  THEY'VE EVER DONE. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA FOR THAT SHOW? A CELEBRITY VERSION. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY... THE REASON THE REASON FOR ALL THIS CONTROVERSY, OF  COURSE, IS THE PRESENCE OF ONE CHAZ BONO.
CHAZ BONO, WHO IS TRANSGENDER, IS A CONTESTANT AND IT'S A CONTROVERSY.
OUTRAGED OUTCRY ONLINE FROM THE AMERICAN FAMILY ASSOCIATION.
ACCUSING THE NETWORK OF PUSHING A HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA.
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IF SOMEONE IS CELEBRATED AND LIFTED TO  HEROIC PROPORTIONS LIKE THAT OF A CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS SOMEWHAT  UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HIS OR HER GENDER MIGHT SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING DOWN THAT ROAD. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: AND WHILE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE, IT IS POSSIBLE. (LAUGHTER) SO I HAD A CHOICE AS A PARENT-- MISS THE ONLY SHOW THAT MAKES ME FEEL YOUNG... (LAUGHTER) OR SPEND A MONTH PREPARING MY CHILDREN FOR THE CONFUSION OF  SEEING A MAN NAMED CHAZ DANCE ON A SHOW. (LAUGHTER) NOW, KIDS, I KNOW YOU DIDN'T ASK ME BUT LET ME EXPLAIN HETERO  NORMATIVE BEHAVIOR TO TWO PEOPLE WHO STILL BELIEVE IN COOTIES. (LAUGHTER) THE TRUTH IS, THE ONLY THING THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE  CHAZ BONO STORY WAS HOW HIS PARENTS EVER GOT TOGETHER. (LAUGHTER) DADDY, HOW DID THE PRETTY BIRD LADY END UP WITH THE TROLLY MUSTACHE KING? (LAUGHTER) I KNOW IT WAS THE '70s, BUT COME ON! SO PREPARED, I FEEL THERE'S NOTHING ON DANCING WITH THE STARS THAT COULD PHASE MY CHILDREN. AND THEN LAST NIGHT I TURN IT ON AND THEY SEE THIS.
LET ME HELP YOU OUT THERE A LITTLE BIT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHY IS THE ANGRY LADY FROM COURT T.V. TRYING TO BREAST-FEED MY CHILDREN? (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN THAT... WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY? "NANCY GRACE'S STREET WINKING AT YOU." (LAUGHTER) OH, NANCY GRACE HAS A TATTOO OF  HER NIPPLE ON HER NIPPLE! (LAUGHTER) REALLY, FLASH DANCE? YOU CAN DO BETTER. YOU CAN... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THERE. THERE. IT IS QUITE A MYSTERY, ISN'T IT? AFTER WEEKS OF FREAKING OUT BECAUSE OF WHAT CHAZ BONO DID TO HIS CHEST SUDDENLY IT'S NANCY  GRACE WHO'S RUBBING HER NIPPLES ALL OVER AMERICA'S CHILDREN. I'D IMAGINE THAT THE FOLKS OVER AT FOX WERE JUST AS HORRIFIED AT  THAT AS THEY WERE AT CHAZ BONO.
NOT SO GRACEFUL WARDROBE MALFUNCTION.
OH, NO! UH-OH, I MISSED IT LAST NIGHT ON "DANCING WITH THE STARS." NANCY GRACE SHOWING A LITTLE  MORE SKIN THAN SHE PROBABLY WANTED TO.
AVERT YOUR EYES.
I MISSED IT. ANY WAY, RICKI LAKE ON TOP OF THE LEADER BOARD WITH 23 POINTS. CHAZ BONO DROPPED TO LAST PLACE. UH-OH, A SCORE OF 17 POINTS.
IT TURNS OUT HE HAS A KNEE INJURY AND IT'S GIVEN CHAZ TROUBLE. WITH MORE ON THAT, STEVE, CAN YOU TELL US?
NO, I CAN'T, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILL
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SUN INSTEAD, THAT MIGHT TAKE TOO  LONG TO EXPLAIN TO STEVE, BRIAN, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.
ONE PART OF CHAZ THAT HASN'T BEEN OPERATED ON.
LIKE I SAID...
SO FAR. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: HA! HA! HA! HA! HA-HA-HA! CHAZ BONO WHEN HE WAS A WOMAN NEVER FELT COMFORTABLE WITH HIS JEND SORE HE SPENT YEARS IN  ANXIETY AND TURMOIL AND HAD TO GO THROUGH PHYSICAL TRIALS AND PAIN TO BE AT PEACE WITH HIS  PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL SELF! HA, HA, HA! NOW HIS KNEES HURT AND HE'S GOING TO GET PENISES PUT ON HIS KNEES! HA, HA! SEVENTH GRADE RULES! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) THE (BLEEP)ING GUY HURT HIS KNEE AND YOU'RE STILL TRYING, HUH, KILL IMMEDIATE? YOU HAD YOUR SHOT, GUYS, FOR ONE SHINING MOMENT YOU WEREN'T THE BIGGEST BOBS ON TELEVISION. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
