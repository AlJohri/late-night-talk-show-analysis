JUNE 20, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. THIS IS DALE DALE WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VISIT FROM OUR GOOD FRIEND AND NOTED AUTHOR STEVE CARELL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT FIRST, BREAKING NEWS. IT IS SO (BLEEP)ING HOT TODAY. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T HAVE A FOLLOWUP TO THAT. (LAUGHTER) BREAKING NEWS CONCERNING THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO THE  ADMINISTRATION'S FAST AND FURIOUS PROGRAM WHICH FROM 2009 TO 2011 SOLD AMERICAN GUNS TO  MEXICAN DRUG LORDS SO THAT THE DRUG LORDS... COULD... SHOOT... PEOPLE? OR PERHAPS ACCIDENTALLY THEMSELVES? THE WHITE HOUSE WAS ON A HIGH AFTER CASH FOR CLUNKERS AND THIS PROGRAM MIGHT HAVE JUST GOTTEN  AWAY FROM THEM, I DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER) THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING THE DEBACLE BUT ATTORNEY GENERAL  ERIC HOLDER HAS REFUSED TO TURN OVER SOME 80,000 DOCUMENTS THAT CHAIRMAN DARRELL ISSA HAS  DEMANDED SITING AS GROUNDS THAT THEY NEED THE PAPERS TO GIFT WRAP OTHER WEAPONS FOR AN  EXCITING NEW PRISON PROGRAM CHRISTMAS GUNS FOR CONVICTS. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF BULL (BLEEP) PARTISAN TYPE  INVESTIGATIONS THAT GO ON ON CAPITOL HILL, MANY OF THEM DESIGNED TO MERELY TIE UP OR  DAMAGE THE ADMINISTRATION, BUT HERE'S THE THING: THE A.T.F. DID  SEND A BUNCH OF GUNS TO MEXICAN DRUG GANGS. ONE OF THOSE GUNS WAS USED TO KILL A U.S. BORDER AGENT. SO YOU KNOW IF HOLDER DIDN'T TURN OVER THE DOCUMENTS THIS WAS COMING.
THE COMMITTEE MEETS TODAY TO CONSIDER REPORTING A RESOLUTION  TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FINDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER, JR., IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS.
Jon: OW. THAT'S GOT TO STING. CONGRESS HOLDING SOMETHING ELSE IN CONTEMPT. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GIVE A DOG A BANANA AND THEY GO "I DON'T EAT  THAT." AND YOU'RE LIKE "YOU LICK YOUR BALLS BUT A BANANA IS BENEATH YOU?"  (LAUGHTER) SERIOUSLY, WHY WON'T DOGS EAT BANANAS? IS THAT JUST MY DOG? IT WON'T EAT BANANAS. DO YOUR DOGS EAT BANANAS? YEAH, DOGS HATE (BLEEP)ING BANANAS. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? (LAUGHTER) BACK TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE PROGRAM WHERE THEY SOLD GUNS TO MEXICAN DRUG LORDS. I GUESS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TURN THOSE DOCUMENTS OVER. UNLESS...
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ENTERED THE FRAY AND ASSERTED EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER THE DOCUMENTS  THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED BY CONGRESSMAN ISSA.
PRESIDENT BUSH ASSERTED SIX EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGES. PRESIDENT CLINTON EXERTED 14. AND THIS IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
Jon: OH, THE FIRST INVOKING OF THE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. A HALLOWED RITE OF PASSAGE. LIKE A PRESIDENCY'S BAR MITZVAH. (LAUGHTER) MAZEL TOV, MR. PRESIDENT. TODAY YOU ARE AN ADMINISTRATION. (LAUGHTER) BUT, OF COURSE, OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHO IS  ATTENDING THE G-20 SUMMIT IN MEXICO WHERE HE'S BEEN MEETING WITH WORLD LEADERS AND PERHAPS  CHECKING WHETHER DRUG LORD GUN SALES ARE HITTING THEIR QUOTAS. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS THERE AS WELL. PERHAPS WE CAN LEAN ON PUTIN TO STOP SELLING HIS WEAPONS TO SYRIAN WAR LORDS BECAUSE SELLING  WEAPONS TO VIOLENT FOREIGN... OH, (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE! IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY TENSE AND COMPLICATED DIPLOMATIC ISSUE.
TALK ABOUT THE BIG CHILL. LET'S SEE THIS. THIS IS BODY LANGUAGE BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: REALLY? BODY LANGUAGE? WE CAN REALLY TRY AND DIVINE THE STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL POLICY NEGOTIATION IT IS SAME WAY  MYSTERY ON THE PICKUP ARTIST LETS NERDS KNOW IF GIRLS ARE INTO THEM? ARE WE DOING THAT?
THE TWO MEN BARELY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.
THEY DID NOT SIT VERY CLOSE TOGETHER.
THEY WERE NOT MAKING EYE CONTACT.
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANY SMILES.
THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FAR APART PHYSICALLY.
PUTIN APPEARED TO LEAN AWAY.
MEDIA REPORTS DESCRIBE THEIR DEMEANOR AS "CHILLY" LIKE A COLD MOSCOW WINTER. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: OBAMA LOOKED NERVOUS AND VLADIMIR DRANK ONLY WATER. IS THIS COUPLE ON THE OUTS OR ARE THEY EXPECTING A BABY? (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOOK, I KNOW IT'S A FUN GAME TO PLAY TO INTERPRET GESTURES BUT I  WOULDN'T READ TOO MUCH INTO THE CHILLY NATURE OF THE MEETING. THIS IS PUTIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN PUTIN NOT LOOK ICY? (LAUGHTER) THIS IS HIM TWO MONTHS AGO AT HIS INAUGURATION! (LAUGHTER) THAT'S A GREAT DAY FOR PUTIN. THIS IS HIM TWO WEEKS LATER AT HIS SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS PUTIN PLAYING WITH KITTENS. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS HIM PERSONALLY ORDERING THE DEATH OF A REPORTER. SAME FACE! THIS IS VLADIMIR PUTIN FULL OF CHILD LIKE WONDER AT THE FIRST SNOW OF WINTER. (LAUGHTER) FIRST SNOW OF WINTER WHICH, IN RUSSIA, I BELIEVE, COMES A WEEK  AFTER THE LAST SNOW OF THE PREVIOUS WINTER. SO THE PERES HAS SPENT HOURS DISSECTING THE BODY LANGUAGE. PROBABLY JUST ABOUT TIME FOR...
ARE WE MAKING TOO MUCH OF A BIG DEAL?
Jon: THERE YOU GO. (LAUGHTER) THE 1213 HAND WRINGER FROM ROCKEFELLER PLAZA. THAT'S YOUR LAMESTREAM LIBERAL MEDIA FOR YOU. WALL-TO-WALL COVERAGE OF SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE NOT SURE IF IT REALLY MATTERS. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN SEE THE GENIUS OF FOX NEWS, THEY KNOW THIS IS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT.
VLADIMIR PUTIN LOOKS AT OUR LEADERS AND HE SEES WEAKNESS.
AT ONE POINT THE PRESIDENT'S CHEEK WAS TWITCHING.
AS THOUGH THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TELLTALE SIGN OF STRESS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO STILL THINKS, GEE, IF I'M NICE TO HIM  WE'LL GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT.
THIS IS PUTIN WHO THINKS IN STRATEGIC TERMS SPEAKING TO SOMEBODY HE CONSIDERS AND ADOLESCENT.
SORT OF REMINISCENT OF THE KRUSCHEV/KENNEDY SUMMIT WHICH ENCOURAGED KRUSCHEV TO PUT  MISSILES IN CUBA.
Jon: (LAUGHS) HOLY (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) THE LIBERAL MEDIA'S ALL "THEY'RE LEANING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER, WHAT DOES IT MEAN? I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS." SKWROBGS JUMPS IN "HE'S A WEAK  CHILD WHO IS BRINGING AMERICA TOWARDS A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST!" THE ONLY THING MISSING: THE LAST  CREATIVE CUE DEGRAS TO TIE THIS INCIDENT UP INTO A BOW, TO CONTRAST THIS DEBACLE AT A TIME  WHEN AMERICA WAS AT ITS GREATEST USING RANDOM JUXTAPOSITION.
COMPLETELY OPPOSITE OF PRESIDENT REAGAN DURING THE WORLD WAR. PRESIDENT REAGAN WAS VERY CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET IN HIS DEALS WITH THE RUSSIANS. YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS CHESTNUT.
MR. GORBACHEV, TEAR DOWN THAT WALL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS HOW IT'S DONE. THAT'S HOW YOU TAKE A FEW SECONDS OF OBAMA VIDEO, TURN IT INTO A RICH SOUP OF  DECONTEXTUALIZED IMAGERY DESIGNED TO BYPASS THE FRONTAL CORTEX AND GO STRAIGHT TO THE  AMYGDALAS OF OLD PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) TRIGGERING CASCADES OF DOPAMINE AND GIVING THEM ALL A GIANT REAGAN BONER. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY THEY'RE NUMBER ONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT
