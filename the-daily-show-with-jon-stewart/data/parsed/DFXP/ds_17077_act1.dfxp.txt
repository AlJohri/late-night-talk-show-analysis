MARCH 27, 2012 FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A VERY NICE SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST IS MARIA GOODAVAGE, HER NEW ABOUT DOGS IN THE MILITARISM  WE'LL GET INTO THE CONTROVERSIAL DON'T ASK, DON'T SMELL. [ LAUGHTER ] DID I MENTION WE'RE BACK FROM VACATION? LAST NIGHT AROUND 10:00 PUT THE KIDS TO BED AND I'M WATCHING, AS I ALWAYS DO AT THIS TIME THE  LAWRENCE O'DONNELL SHOW BECAUSE THAT'S THE PREMISES OF THE BIT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO. ANYHOO MR. O'DON'T IS SUPPOSED TO INTERVIEW CRAIG SONNER THE  LAWYER AT THE CENTER OF GEORGE ZIMMERMAN CASE.
GEORGE SONNER THE COURAGEOUS DEFENDER OF GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WALKED OUT OF STUDIO. THERE IS HIS CHAIR IN ORLANDO.
NOT THE MOST ENTHRALLING TELEVISION BUT IT'S MISS NEEB. I DIDN'T THINK DRESSING A GRIZZLY BEAR IN HUMAN CLOTHES OF A GOOD IDEA BUT YOU KNOW THEY  MADE THAT WORK. [ LAUGHTER ] PANDA, WHAT NO? [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY HAVE IT IT. WHO IS PAGE YOU, MR. LAWYER? WHO HIRED YOU? WHEN EXACTLY DID THEY HIRE YOU? DOES GEORGE ZIMMERMAN HAVE A JOB? DOES HE HAVE ANY PROPERTY? DID YOU REPRESENT HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT ON A POLICE OFFICER? DO YOU HAVE THE MEDICAL RECORDS THAT YOU CAN SHOW US?
HE'S GRILLING THE CHAIR! [ LAUGHTER ] NO, THE CHAIR DOESN'T HAVE MEDICAL RECORDS TO SHOW YOU. IT'S A CHAIR. YOU SHOULD BE YELLING AT THE FILING CABINET. NOTE TO SELF, DO NOT GO TO IKEA WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL. [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU CALL YOURSELF A FARALOGGIN YOU ARE NO MORE A GARFUNG -- I LIVE IN NEW YORK  CITY I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE YELLING AT CHAIRS. NONE OF THEM HAVE TV SHOWS. [ LAUGHTER ] AFTER WATCHING THIS P FOR LIKE TEN MINUTES I STARTED FEELING BADLY FOR THE CHAIR. TONIGHT WE HAVE THE CHAIR'S LAWYER WHO WAS WITH HIM DURING THE INTERVIEW. WE HAVE FAN WITH US. HELLO FAN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I KNOW YOU ARE BUSY THIS TIME OF YEAR IN FLORIDA FLM IT'S IN BETWEEN SPRING AND SUMMER, PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO USE THEIR AIR CONDITIONING. ALL RIGHT. EVEN I CAN'T SUSTAIN THIS BIT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, THE OTHER WAY WE WERE GOING TO GO THIS WITH BECAUSE WE WERE SO EXCITED WHEN WE SAW HIM  YELLING AT THE CHAIR? WE CAME UP WITH TWO IDEAS FOR THE BIT. THE OTHER PREMISE WAS SIMPLY ZIMMERMAN'S LAWYER THERE WAS THE WHOLE TINY HE IS JUST TIEN. DID YOU REPRESENT HIM THEN.
I'M RIGHT HERE. GIVE ME A CHANCE TO TALK YOU POMPOUS SON OF A (bleep). I'M OUT OF HERE.
Jon: NOT JUST THAT WAS IGNORED BUT AFTER HE BAILED ON THE INTERVIEW IT TOOK HIM 20  MINUTES TO WALK ACROSS THE CHAIR. I'M SORRY. SOMETIMES IT'S FUN TO BE STUPID. [ LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL BATON DEATH MARCH CONTINUES WITH RECENT PRIMARY  WINNER RICK SANTORUM STEPPING UP HIS ATTACK ON ONE --
PICK ANY OTHER REPUBLICAN IN THE COUNTRY, HE IS THE WORST REPUBLICAN IN THE COUNTRY TO PUT  UP AGAINST BARACK OBAMA.
Jon: THE WORST? COME ON! I CAN THINK OF PLENTY OF WORST. THERE'S THAT MAYOR THAT RESPONDED TO ALLEGATIONS HIS POLICE FORCE WAS A TACKING THE  LATINOS LIKE THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DO DOING FOR THE LATINO COMMUNITY TODAY?
I MIGHT HAVE TACK GROWS WHEN I GO HOME. I'M NOT SURE YET.
Jon: WHAT YOU THINK OF MITT ROMNEY HE'S A STEP UP FROM THE TACO MAYOR. IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR IT WAS PRIMARILY MEANT IN ROMNEY'S RECORD ON HEALTH CARE. IT WASN'T THE MOST ARTFUL PHRASING BUT YOU WOULD YOU HAVE TO GO OUT OF THE WAY TO  MISREPRESENT IT. LET'S DO THAT.
YOU SAID MITT ROMNEY WAS THE WORE THE REPUBLICAN IN THE COUNTRY.
WHAT SPEECH DID YOU LISTEN TO?
RIGHT HERE.
STOP LYING. I SAID HE WAS THE WORST REPUBLICAN TO RUN ON THE ISSUE OF OBAMACARE AND THAT'S WHAT I  WAS TALKING ABOUT.
Jon: ARRRHG. I'M ANGRY. AGGGRRR. I KIND OF LIKE GUY WITH A LITTLE FIRE IN HIS BELLY. PROBABLY NOT GOING TO PUSH TIGHT FAR, RIGHT, RICK?
TO RUN AGAINST THE BARACK OBAMA ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE. I'VE BEEN SAYING IT IN EVERY SPEECH QUIT DISTORTING MY WORDS. IF I SEE IT, IT'S (bleep).
Jon: I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. RICK SANTORUM A CONSERVATIVE SWEARING AT A REPORTER. I THINK THIS IS HOW HE SHOULD TALK FROM NOW ON. I BELIEVE LIFE BEGINS AT (bleep) CONCEPTION. YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT (bleep). BOOM! [ LAUGHTER ] ARRRRGGGHH,. I JUST WANTED TO SEE THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] TICKETS WERE FREE BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE AN EYE. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THE REAL SANTORUM MIGHT BE MORE BAD ASS THAN WE REALIZE. HE LOOKS ALL MILQUETOASTY IN THE SWEATER VESTS BUT I THINK THEY STARTED OUT AS SWEATERS AND HE  RIPS THE ARMS OFF! [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS UPSET. IT'S A GOTCHA QUESTION. THE PRESS CAN GET GOTCHAY. WATCH THIS EXCHANGE BETWEEN WOLF BLITZER AND MITT ROMNEY.
MY DAD GETTING R AND R THIS WEEKEND AT THE MOVIES TODAY WITH ME AND MY KIDS. YOU WENT TO SEE THE HUNGER GAMES. HOW DID YOU LIKE THAT?
Jon: WOW, THAT'S THE KIND OF QUESTION YOU ASK A CHAIR. SERIOUSLY EASY QUESTION THOUGH, RIGHT. IT'S ROMNEY. YOU NEVER KNOW IF HE'S GO TO GO I LOVED IT, HATED. GO THUMBS UP AND DOWN.
IT WAS NICE TO SEE A FLICK FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME.
PG-13, IS IT A LITTLE TOO VIOLENT FOR YOUNG KIDS?
THIS WHOLE THING WAS A SETUP TO NAIL ROMNEY ON THE HOT BUTTON  ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT HE IS A RESPONSIBLE GRANDPA. MR. ROMNEY YOUR MUG SAYS WORLD'S GREATEST GRANDPA THE BUT THE FACTS SAY OTHERWISE. DUDE, IT WAS A PG-13 MOVIE NOT A RAVE.
I THINK IT'S DISTURBING FOR YOUNG KIDS. THE PG-13 IS AN INDICATION OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE FILM BUT I'M OVER 13 NOW.
Jon: BOOM. IT WAS FUNNY. NICELY DONE. YOU MADE A JOKE AND PREVENTED WOLF BLITZER FROM PROVING YOU ARE UNDER 13 AND INELIGIBLE FOR  THE PRESIDENT SIX HOPEFULLY THAT SETTLES GRANDPA GATE.
I'M OVER 13 NOW. BUT YOU WENT WITH YOUNG KIDS, RIGHT?
YOU FEEL BAD THAT MORMONS CAN'T CURSE BECAUSE IF ANYTHING  DESERVES THE SANTORUM TREATMENT.
IT'S (bleep).
IT WAS THOSE QUESTIONS. I'M NOT SURE WHY ROMNEY BOTHERED LEAVING THE HOUSE TO SEE A POST APOP LIPPIC NIGHTMARE. HE COULD HAVE STAYED HOME AND WATCHED THIS COMMERCIAL FROM SAN FORUM ABOUT OBAMA.
IMAGINE THIS WILL SMALL TOWN IF OBAMA IS REELECTED. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING AND FAMILIES ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR JOBS AND THEIR FUTURES. THE WAIT TO SEE A DOCTOR IS EVER INCREASING. GAS PRICES THROUGH THE ROOF. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: (bleep). I WOULD TOTALLY TAKE MITT ROMNEY'S GRAND KIDS TO SEE THAT MOVIE. APPARENTLY THAT COMMERCIAL IS MEANT TO SHOW THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH A REPEAT OBAMA WIN WOULD  BE DISASTROUS FOR OUR NATION INCLUDING MILLIONS OF LOST CHUCK TAYLORS, STARK LAYOFFS IN THE  CREEPY LITTLE GIRL SECTOR, OF COURSE A HUGE SPIKE IN GAS NOZZLE SUICIDES. DO IT (bleep), NOTHING HAPPENS. PULL THE TRIGGER. GAS COMES OUT. YOU SMELL LIKE GAS FOR A DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW THE OBAMA REELECTION POST APOCALYPTIC 2014 HEALTH SCARE DEPICTED IS INTERESTING  FOR MANY REASONS BUT FOR ONE IN PARTICULAR DESPITE BEING CALLED OWE BALLAVILLE THE TOWN IN  QUESTION DOES NOT AFEAR HAVE A SINGLE BLACK PERSON LIVING IN IT. THE POPULATION IS 100% UNHAPPY WHITE PEOPLE. RICK SANTORUM THINKS IF BARACK OBAMA GETS REELECTED ALL OF OBAMA AS BLACK PEOPLE GET RAPTURED. YOU THINK THE WHITE FOLKS WOULD BE HAPPIER FOR
