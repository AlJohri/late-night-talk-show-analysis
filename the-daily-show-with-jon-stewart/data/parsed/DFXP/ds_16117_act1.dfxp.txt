SEPTEMBER 29, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Barry:  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT WILL BE CAROLINE KENNEDY, NO RELATION. AND BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH BARACK OBAMA. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW HOW YOU HATE BARACK OBAMA? NOT DISAPPOINTED. NOT WISH HE HANDLED CERTAIN ISSUES IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, BUT HATE HIM, JUST REALLY WANT TO NAIL HIM. HE HAD A GOOD RUN ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE THING, BUT TURNS OUT HE HAD ONE. WORKED REAL HARD AT THE SECRET MUSLIM, AND THEN HE WENT OUT AND KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN. AKONG REVEREND WRIGHT, BILL AYERS, TONIES AREICO, HIGH NEW JERSEY TWO OR THREE WARS AND GUY  IS STILL HANGING AROUND 40% APPROVAL. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE LOST HOPE, I SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS. AND WELCOME TO OUR NEW SEGMENT-- THE CUSTOM-TAILORED OBAMA SCANDAL YOU ORDERED IS FINALLY HERE. I'LL LET THE NEWS MEDIA FILL YOU IN.
THE WIDENING SCANDAL INVOLVING A COMPANY HIGHLY TOUTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE CENTERPIECE OF THE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PITCH TO THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE CREATION OF MORE GREEN JOBS.
THE COMPANY THAT HAS NOW DECLARED BANKRUPTCY, LAID OFF ALL 1100 OF ITS WORKERS AND WAS  RAIDED BY THE F.B.I. LAST WEEK.
Jon:  COMPANIES COME AND GO ALL THE TIME. IT'S NOT LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LONED THIS COMPANY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS AND THE COMPANY  NAME SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THOSE WEIRD PLANETS CAPTAIN KIRK FOUND HIMSELF ON, YOU KNOW THE ONES  THAT WERE JUST LIKE EARTH ONLY ALL THE WOMEN WEAR ORANGE.
THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR PANEL COMPANY SOLYNDRA, WHICH RECEIVED A MAJOR LONE FROM THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT ONLY TO COLLAPSE.
SOLYNDRA RECEIVED $535 BILLION IN HELENE GUARANTEES TO EXPAND PRODUCTION OF CUTTING  EDGE SOLAR PANELS.
EARTH TO ENTERPRIZE. HOW MANY MONEY DID WE GIVE THOSE... IDIOTS? SPOCK, WHY DIDN'T YOU WARN ME? TERRIBLE, CAPTAIN KIRK. SORRY. ALL RIGHT, FINE, SO A SOLAR PANEL COMPANY THAT WE GAVE $500 MILLION TO COLLAPSED. $500 MILLION IS ONLY 1.3% OF THE MONEY GIVEN OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT'S GREEN ENERGY PROGRAM. MOST OF THE OTHER COMPANIES THAT BENEFITED FROM THAT MONEY, SOLE AWIND, NUCLEAR, THEY'RE DOING FINE. IN TRUTH THANK YOU SCANDAL WOULD ONLY BE EXPLOITABLE IF THE PRESIDENT HAD MADE THIS ONE  PARTICULAR COMPANY THE POSTAR CHILD FOR THE PROGRAM IF HE HAD TOURED THE SOLYNDRA FACILITIES  OR MET WITH THE C.E.O. OR PRAISED ITS CUTTING EDGE INGENUITY IN A SPEECH THAT IN  RETROSPECT WILL SEEM ILL-ADVISED.
THE TRUE ENGINE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL ALWAYS BE COMPANIES LIKE SOLYNDRA. IT'S HERE THAT COMPANIES LIKE SOLYNDRA ARE A LEADING THE WAY TOWARD A BRIGHTER AND MORE  PROSPEROUS FUTURE.
Jon:  GENERATIONS FROM NOW, WHEN INTELLIGENT APES RULE OVER THIS LAND, ONLY TWO  ARTIFACTS OF OUR CIVILIZATION WILL WEMAIN. HALF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AND THIS BEAUTIFUL FACTORY, WHICH WILL STILL BE HIM ALONG AND PIG  AS MEMBERSHIP AS 1100 APES. ( LAUGHTER ) SO DOES FAILURE OF ONE COMPANY DISCREDIT THE ENTIRE IDEA OF A GREEN ENERGY ECONOMY? OF COURSE NOT. BUT IF IN, LET'S SAY, 1936, YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF AIR TRAVEL IN  FRONT OF, I DON'T KNOW, THE HIND'D HINDENBURG, YOU'D BE  RIGHT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF AIR TRAVEL. BUT YOU'D STILL BE ON ( BLEEP ) FIRE. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, THE STUPIDITY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO THE ADMINISTRATION, MAYBE THEIR HEARTS ARE IN THE RIGHT  PLACE AND THEY JUST BET ON THE WRONG HORSE. IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S ANY DAMNING EVIDENCE THEY KNEW IN ADVANCE THAT THE HORSE WAS A DONKEY.
HOUSE REPUBLICAN INVESTIGATORS HAVE UNEARTHED E-MAILS REVIEWED BY NBC WHICH  REVEAL REPEATED WARNINGS BY GOVERNMENT STAFF BEARS THE LOAN. "THIS DEAL IS NOT RETREAD FOR PRIME TIME" DAYS BEFORE FINAL APPROVAL A  WARNING THAT ONE MODEL SHOWED THE PROJECT WOULD RUN OUT OF CASH IN SEPTEMBER 2011. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  BURN ON YOU. SOLYNDRA WENT OUT OF BUSINESS, SEPTEMBER 6, 2011. ON THE PLUS SIDE, HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR FACELESS BUREAUCRATS? I ALMOST HESITATE TO ASK THIS, BUT IS THERE ANY FORMULATION OF THE SOLYNDRA BUSINESS MODEL THAT WOULD PERHAPS PAINT THIS IN EVEN  MORE STARK WAYS THE FOOLISHNESS OF OUR INVESTMENT.
SOME FINANCIAL ANALYSTS WHO STUDIED THE INDUSTRY SAYS SOLYNDRA'S BUSINESS PLAN TO  BUILD SOLAR PANELS OF FATALLY FLAWED FROM BEGINNING.
THEIR PRICE IS OVER $6 TO PRODUCE THE PRODUCT. THEY WERE SELLING IT AT ABOUT $3. BUT WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS, IT JUST DIDN'T WORK. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  I WONDER IF THAT'S WHY MY BUSINESS, JOHNNY'S CAPITOL HILL 10 BILL GET ONE  FREE BUY ONE EMPORIUM, DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE I HAD PLENTY OF VOLUME. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, STORIES ABOUT INCOMPETENCE IN GOVERNMENT ARE ONLY GOING TO GET YOU SO FAR, THOUGH. FOR THIS TO TRULY BECOME A WEAPONS-GRADE POLITICAL FODDER, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED INCOMPETENCE WITH MORE THAN JUST A WHIFF OF SINISTER CRONYISM.
ACCORDING TO WHITE HOUSE LOGES, ONE OF SOLYNDRA'S PRINCIPAL INVEST ORGANIZE GEORGE  KAISER, WHO WAS A BIG OBAMA FUND-RAISER, VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE AT LEAST FOUR TIMES BEFORE  THE LOPE'S FINAL APPROVAL TO SEE AIDES.
Jon:  I RARELY USE THIS LINE FOR BLATANT PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT, BUT IF I MAY, FOX  NEWS, CALL YOUR DOCTOR BECAUSE THE ERECTION YOU CURRENTLY HAVE HAVE... ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IS GOING TO LAST LONGER THAN FOUR HOURS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WOW. JUST HOW BAD IS IT? JUST HOW BAD IS THIS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION? YOU KNOW HOW WHENEVER THERE'S A SCANDAL CONGRESS HOLDS A HEARING TO INVESTIGATE THE MATTER BUT  THEY USUALLY JUST PROVE THEMSELVES TO BE CLUELESS GRAND STANDERS. WATCH THE CONGRESS FROM CALIFORNIA LAY SERIOUS SOLAR SHAQ DOWN ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE  DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S LOAN PROGRAM.
WERE YOU INFORMED THERE HAVE BEEN MORE FALSE STARTS AND FAILURES IN THIN FILMS. WERE YOU AWARE AS WE TALK ABOUT CHINA, CHINA HAS CONCENTRATED ALMOST OSTENSIBLY IN POLLY  CRYSTAL TECHNOLOGY AND AVOID THIN FILM?
Jon:  AT LOT OF LONGLAST HAVE YOU NO CALCULATION OF THE ABILITY OF SOLAR FLARES AND THE  PHOTO SYNTHETIC ALGORITHM, SIR. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) THAT CONGRESSMAN FROM CALIFORNIA IS TALKING ABOUT, BUT  HERE'S THE THING-- HE DOES. DEAR LORD, IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, WHO WILL HAVE THE LAST WORD? THE MOST IRONIC WORD, WORDS THAT WERE PERHAPS SPOKEN BY A VIDEO CHAT ON THE OCCASION OF THE  GROUNDBREAKING OF SOLYNDRA'S NOW-SHUTTERED PLANT?
ONCE YOUR FACILITY OPENS, THERE WILL BE ABOUT 1,000 PERMANENT NEW JOBS HERE AT SOLYNDRA, AND IN THE SURROUNDING  BUSINESS COMMUNITY, AND HUNDREDS MORE TO INSTALL YOUR GROWING OUTPUT OF SERIAL PANELS  THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IT'S IMPORTANT, IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE JOBS ARE GOING TO BE PERMANENT JOBS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YOU KNOW, JOE, I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT THERE'S REALLY NO SUCH THING AS A  PERMANENT JOB. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
