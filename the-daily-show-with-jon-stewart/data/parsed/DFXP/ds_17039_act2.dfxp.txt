Jon: WELCOME BACK. A FIT MEAN ROMNEY AND SANTORUM AS A BOTTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AS JASON JONES FOUND OUT IN FLORIDA, THERE IS A BIGGER AND MORE DANGEROUS THREAT TO  THE INTEGRITY OF THE GRAND OL PARTY.
THIS IS NEZER HAMVI, DIRECTOR OF A NONPROFIT AND A DEVOUT MUSLIM WITH A SURPRISING POLITICAL LEANING.
I CONSIDER MYSELF A REPUBLICAN, CON VERVE DIFFICULT INDIVIDUAL.
ARE YOU A REPUBLICAN.
YEAH, REGISTERED REPUBLICAN.
WHY?
RONALD REAGAN HAS BEEN A CHILDHOOD HERO OF MINE. I IDENTIFIED MYSELF BECAUSE OF REAGAN WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
AND IN BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA, WHEN A BOY REPUBLICAN BECOMES A MAN REPUBLICAN HE GOES TO THE REPUBLICAN EXECUTIVE  COMMITTEE TO APPLY FOR MEMBERSHIP.
WELL, I APPLIED TO JOIN. I MET ALL THE APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS. BUT WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS A VERY WELL ORCHESTRATED CAMPAIGN AGAINST ME.
HOW SO.
THERE WERE HAND OUTS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL HAD PRINTED AGAINST ME CALLING ME A  TERRORIST, SAYING, YOU KNOW, ISLAM IS EVIL.
THE CAMPAIGN WORKED. AND THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE VOTED AGAINST HIS MEMBERSHIP 158 TO 11.
AFTER ALL THAT, YOU STILL WANT TO BE A REPUBLICAN.
YEAH.
THAT IS SO NONSENSICAL, THAT IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME THINK THAT YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN.
HE NEEDED TO OVERCOME THIS VITRIOLIC ISLAM O PHOBIA. FORTUNATELY THERE ARE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS DEDICATED TO FIGHTING INTOLERANCE SUCH AS  AMERICANS AGAINST HATE. I SAT DOWN WITH ITS FOUNDER JOE KAUFMAN.
AMERICANS AGAINST HATE FIGHTS AGAINST BIGOT REE.
SO WHEN YOU AND YOUR GROUP AMERICANS AGAINST HATE HEARD THAT MR. HAMVI WAS NOT  ALLOWED INTO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHAT DID YOU DO?
WELL, I-- I PERSONALLY PRAISED THE LEADERSHIP OF THE BROWARD REPUBLICAN PARTY --
WAIT WHAT?
I SPOKE OUT AGAINST HIM. I PUT TOGETHER FLIERS AND I HAD THEM DISTRIBUTED AT THE MEETING.
OH S SO IT WAS KAUFMAN, THE ANTI-BIGOTRY CRUSADER WHO CALLED HAM VERY A TERRORIST.
WHAT IS THE NAME OF YOUR GROUP AGAIN.
AMERICANS AGAINST HATE.
RIGHT.
AND WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITE NATION OF AGAINST.
WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF "AGAINST"
YEAH.
GOING AGAINST SOMETHING THAT YOU BELIEVE IS WRONG.
WE JUST USED THE SAME WORD.
I KNOW, BUT I DON'T EXACTLY HAVE THE DICTIONARY IN FRONT OF ME TO FIGURE THAT OUT.
BUT YOU DON'T NEED A DIXARY TO SEE WHY MAMVI DOESN'T BELONG IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY.
WELL, HE IS THE LOCAL HEAD OF CARE, THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC RELATIONS, AN ORGANIZATION THAT WAS STARTED BY A TERRORIST GROUP OVERSEAS.
YES, CARE, THE NEFARIOUS MUSLIM CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP LEAD BY DIRECTOR NIHADA WAD, A MAN NO REPUBLICAN WOULD EVER ASSOCIATE WITH. BUT KAUFMAN'S OUTRAGE WAS MET IN KIND.
HE CALLED ME SOMETHING CALLED AN ISLAMOPHONE.
AN ISLAMOPHONENESS WHICH INN ISLAMOPHONE. INDEED I'M A TERRORPHONE.
YOU DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
ARE YOU JUST JUNNING HIM ON ASSUMED ASSOCIATIONS WITH.
NO DOUBT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM DOING.
WAS-- HOW DE TACK STACK UP AGAINST A REAL REPUBLICAN ON THE KEY ISSUES.
CAP AND TRADE.
I'M AGAINST CAP AND TRADE.
I'M AGAINST CAP AID TRADE.
GAY MARRIAGE.
I'M AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE.
SURE ARE YOU.
I'M FOR TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE.
ABORTION,.
I'M AGAINST ABORTION, PRO-LIFE.
FISCAL, FREE MARKET, I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE-- I FEEL WE NEED TO SEE --
PRETTY REPUBLICAN.
ARE YOU SURE OF THAT.
I'M POSITIVE.
I MEAN HE IS-- IN A LOT OF WAYS LIKE YOU, YOU KNOW.
BIG BUSINESS, SMALL MINDED.
THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT AGAIN, HE WILL NEVER BE A PART OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
HE HAD BEEN DUMPED. AND NEEDED TO MOVE ON WITH A REBOUND.
SOME LOOSE PARTY TO GET HIMSELF INTO. I SET UP A SPEED DATE WITH FLORIDA'S MOST ELIGIBLE POLITICAL PARTY.
WE NEED TO CUT SPENDING. AND WE NEED TO RAISE TAXES.
RAISE TAXES.
RAISE TAXES.
NEXT.
I'M ANDREW. MODERN WIG PARTY.
A SENSE OF HUMOR, AT LEAST.
SERIOUSLY THOUGH WHAT PARTY ARE YOU WITH.
THE MODERN WIG PARTY.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
APPRECIATE IT.
WE ARE THE PARTY OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM. WE WORK TO ALLOW STATES TO INTRODUCE COMPETING CURRENCIES INTO THE MARKET.
I'M SORRY, YOU SAID STATES.
STATES.
SO FLORIDA WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN MONEY.
THEY WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO.
GOING TO LET YOU BELOW THIS ONE.
A BUNCH OF DUDS.
IT WAS UP TO NEZ IRTO SAY SOMETHING. ANYTHING TO GET HIS REPUBLICAN PARTY BACK.
