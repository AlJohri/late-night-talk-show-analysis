Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, HILLARY ROSEN'S COMMENTS ON WORKING MOTHERS WASN'T THE ONLY NEWS LAST WEEK REGARDING  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE. LET'S GO TO WISCONSIN.
WISCONSIN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER QUIETLY SIGNED A BILL LAST NIGHT REPEALING THE STATE  EQUAL PAY LAW. GLEN GROWTHMAN WHO PUSHD FOR EQUAL PAY REPEAL EXPLAINS YOU CAN ARGUE THAT MONEY IS MORE  IMPORTANT FOR MEN. I THINK A GUY IN THEIR FIRST JOB MAYBE BECAUSE THEY EXPECT TO BE A BREAD WINNER SOME DAY.
Jon: EVEN FOR A BILL MEANT TO SCREW WOMEN, THAT TAKES BALLS. IT'S JUST THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF CONSERVATIVE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS THAT SEEM  TO TO A MULTI-STATE ROLL BACK A NUMBER OF RIGHTS WOMEN HAVE COME TO ENJOY. I WISH THERE WAS A PITTSBURGHIER WAY TO SAY THAT.
THE G.O.P. WAR ON WOMEN HAS EXPLODED.
Jon: CATCHY. WAR ON WOMEN? A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
IT'S NOT A WAR ON WOMEN.
THE RIDICULOUS OF THIS WAR ON WOMEN.
PHONY WAR ON WOMEN.
IT IS ONLY THE CYNICISM THAT PORTRAYS THAT AS A WAR ON WOMEN.
THIS IS A MADE UP PHONY WAR ON WOMEN.
Jon: RESPECT. I THINK WHAT FOX IS TRYING TO SAY IS ELEVATING THIS POLITICAL FIGHT TO THE LEVEL  OF WAR NIN INS THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH REAL CONFLICTS ARE ENGAGED. WAR IS REAL. WAR IS HELL. NOT SOME CASUAL METAPHOR.
THERE'S A WAR ON CHRISTMAS IN AMERICA.
I DID NOT KNOW THAT. I DID NOT. CHRISTMAS SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IF FOX BELIEVES THE ATTACKS ON CHRISTMAS ARE SO SERIOUS AS TO WARRANT THIS LABEL THEY ARE  OTHERWISE LOATH TO USE, I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THE REASONING.
A LOT OF COMPANIES HAVEN'T BEEN SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS. THEY'VE BEEN GOING HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
CALLING THE STATE HOUSE CHRISTMAS TREE A HOLIDAY TREE.
A POSSIBLE TAX ON YOUR TREE.
THE TULSA HOLIDAY PARADE OF LIGHTS. FORMALLY THE CHRISTMAS PARADE OF LIGHTS.
THE HOMEOWNERS STATION DOYLESTOWN BANNING COLORED AND BLINKING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.
Jon: NO COLORED LIGHTS? THIS IS WAR. WHEN IT COMES TO CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AT DOYLESTOWN STATION, IT'S WHITES ONLY. ONLY THIS TIME LIBERALS WON'T LIFT A FINGER. THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG CASE FOR A WAR ON CHRISTMAS. YOU DO HAVE TO ASK THEN, SO WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE FOR SOME KIND OF WAR ON WOMEN.
ARIZONA'S LEGISLATURE WOULD FORCE WOMEN TO PROVE TO EMPLOYERS THEY ARE USING BIRTH  CONTROL FOR MEDICAL REASONS.
IN MISSISSIPPI TODAY CRIMINALIZE ABORTION AT MURDER.
ARIZONA DOCTORS WILL NOT FACE A LAWSUIT IF THEY FAIL TO TELL PARENTS ABOUT ANY RISKS  THE UNBORN CHILD COULD FACE.
PENNSYLVANIA WOULD REQUIRE SONOGRAMS BEFORE ABORTIONS.
THE TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND WHEN SEEKING AN ABORTION IN VIRGINIA.
THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE'S OPPOSITION TO THIS.
IN TEXAS A BILL THAT WOULD BLOCK PLANNED PARENTHOOD FROM RECEIVING STATE PLANNING MONEY.
A BILL MAKING SINGLE PARENTING CHILD ABUSE.
IF YOU LIKE TO BEAT YOUR WIFE YOU SHOULD MOVE TO TOPEKA KANSAS BECAUSE IT'S LEGAL THERE.
Reporter: OF COURSE IF YOU WATCH THE BEST BARBECUE, KANSAS CITY IS WHERE IT'S AT. FOR WIFE BEATING YOU CAN HEAD TO TOPEKA. WOW! WITH ALL THOSE ATTEMPTS TO CURTAIL WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN AREA AFTER AREA, ARE YOU TELLING ME  THAT THAT DOESN'T RAISE THE LEVEL OF WAR? THAT DOESN'T BOTHER ANYONE AT FOX?
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS GETS ME TO UPSET. I HAVE A FEELING I MIGHT HAVE TO LEAVE FOR THESE DISCUSSIONS.
Reporter: SHE WASN'T TALKING ABOUT WOMEN'S ISSUES. WHAT WAS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
THERE APPARENTLY IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN STOCKTON CALIFORNIA. THEY CAN'T HAVE THINGS THAT REMIND PEOPLE OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON LIKE POINSETTIAS OR  SANTA IN THEIR CLASSES BECAUSE IT MIGHT OFFEND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CHRISTIAN.
Jon: WELL, THAT IS UPSETTING. WHAT CAN WOMEN DO TO GENERATE THE SAME SENSE OF OUTRAGE FROM FOX AS THE REMOVAL OF  DECORATIVE SLIGHTLY POLYGAMOUS HOLIDAY PLANS? PERHAPS THEY COULD PLAY INTO THE THEME. MAYBE WOMEN COULD PROTECT THEIR... REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS FROM UNWANTED MEDICAL INTRUSIONS WITH VAGINA MANGERS. I HAD NOT SEEN THAT PICTURE. THAT REALLY COULD BE ANYTHING. IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE THE CROWN FROM THOSE IMPERIAL MARGARINE COMMERCIALS. PERHAPS INSTEAD OF ASKING FOR BIRTH CONTROL, WOMEN COULD GET AN ADVENT CALENDAR WITH PILLS  INSTEAD OF CHOCOLATE. THE 20th, PLACEBO DAY. ALL RIGHT. CHRISTMAS IS A SPECIAL CASE. THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT HOLIDAY. I'M SURE THAT NOTHING ELSE RISES TO THAT LEVEL OF OUTRAGE.
WAR ON HANUKKAH NOW TOO.
A WAR ON EASTER.
A WAR ON... WAIT FOR IT. ALL HOLIDAYS.
LET'S TALK WAR ON HALLOWEEN.
WAR ON FOSSIL FUELS.
WAR ON THE CONSTITUTION.
THE WAR ON LADIES' NIGHT.
CAN YOU ACCEPT THE WAR ON SALT.
IT'S THE WAR ON CHOCOLATE MILK.
WAR ON SUGARY DRINKS.
WAR ON FOOD.
IS THIS A NANNY STATE WAR ON SPUDS?
Jon: OH, MY GOD. NO WONDER WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. WE'RE IN LIKE 18 WARS. OH, MY GOD. WE'RE SPARTA. SEEMS LIKE WOMEN ARE THE ONLY THING THERE'S NOT CURRENTLY A WAR ON. GOT TO BE SOME WAY TO EARN AMERICA'S WOMEN COVETED WAR LABEL.
THE MEDIA WAGES A WAR ON CONSERVATIVE WOMEN.
Jon: OH, SO FOR FOX IF WOMEN UPSET WITH RECENT REPUBLICAN LEGISLATIVE  RESTRICTIONS WANT TO BE CONSIDERED VICTIMS OF WAR THE SOLUTION IS EASY. VOTE FOR THEM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
