(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, AS WE HAVE RECENTLY DOCUMENTED ON THIS VERY PROGRAM, THERE IS NOTHING THAT THE RIGHT ENJOYS MORE IN THIS COUNTRY THAN COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS  FOR THEM TO ENJOY BEING IN THIS COUNTRY.
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA HOLDS CONSERVATIVES TO DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAN THEIR LIBERAL COLLEAGUES.
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WANTS TO BLAME THE REPUBLICANS.
IT SEEMS THE MEDIA IS WAGING A WAR AGAINST CONSERVATIVE WOMEN.
SCIENTIFIC PROOF THAT THE MAINSTREAM LIBERAL MEDIA IS BLATANTLY LIBERAL IN ITS BIAS. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: CONSERVATIVES HATE THE LIBERAL MEDIA SO MUCH THEY'RE EVEN WILLING TO ACCEPT AN  ARGUMENT BASED ON SCIENCE! (LAUGHTER) AND YOU KNOW, THE WORST PART ABOUT WHEN THE RIGHT COMPLAINS ABOUT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA? WHEN THEIR ARGUMENT CONTAINS A KERNEL OF TRUTH. UGH! CASE IN POINT, THIS WEEK'S "NEWSWEEK" COVER WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE CAPTURED MINNESOTA CONGRESSWOMAN'S... (AUDIENCE REACTS) MICHELE BACHMANN AT THE EXACT MOMENT SHE SEES THE AMAZING  REVOLTO TURN HIS HAT INTO A DOVE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S AMAZING! WHEN DO WE START THE PHOTO SHOOT? (LAUGHTER) LOOK, "NEWSWEEK," "NEWSWEEK"... (LAUGHTER). THAT'S A (BLEEP)Y PICTURE OF MICHELE BACHMANN. AND CLEARLY NOT AN ACCIDENTALLY BLEEPY PICTURE OF MICHELE BACHMANN. BECAUSE YOU CAN SAY A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT MICHELE BACHMANN-- A LOT OF THINGS-- (LAUGHTER)  BUT HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN'T SAY ABOUT MICHELE BACHMANN: THAT SHE IS NOT PHOTOGENIC. I MEAN, LOOK AT HER. HERE SHE IS INSIDE. HERE SHE IS OUTSIDE. JESUS, THAT COULD BE A SHAMPOO AD! (LAUGHTER) HERE SHE IS SCREAMING INTO A BULLHORN AND MAKING IT LOOK ATTRACTIVE. (LAUGHTER) MY POINT IS YOU'VE GOT TO GO PRETTY FAR OUT OF YOUR WAY TO  FIND A CRAPPY PHOTO OF MICHELE BACHMANN. AND YOU DID. (LAUGHTER) WHY?
IN A STATEMENT, "NEWSWEEK" EDITOR TINA BROWN SAID MICHELE  BACHMANN'S INTENSITY IS GALVANIZING VOTERS IN IOWA RIGHT NOW. AND "NEWSWEEK'S" COVER CAPTURES THAT. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: NO, NO. NO IT DOESN'T. THAT'S NOT A "I'M GALVANIZING THE VOTERS IN IOWA" PICTURE. I LOOK AT THAT PICTURE AND THINK "ISN'T THAT A LITTLE SOON TO BE  DOING A FEMALE REMAKE OF THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN"? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S NOT A NICE PICTURE. I MEAN, I GET IT, "NEWSWEEK". YOU PUT IN "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" JUXTAPOSED WITH A PICTURE OF A LADY THAT APPEARS TO BE  ENCHANTED BY SIMPLE MATH BEING HUNG ON A BLACK BOARD. OR MAYBE IT'S A CHILD THINKING OF PIGS. BUT BE HONEST, "NEWSWEEK", YOU USED THAT PHOTO IN A PETTY  ATTEMPT TO MAKE MICHELE BACHMANN LOOK CRAZY. AND THAT'S WHAT HER WORDS ARE FOR! (LAUGHTER) IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN A GAY AND LESBIAN LIFE-STYLE IT'S BONDAGE, IT'S A VERY SAD LIFE. IT'S PART OF SATAN, I THINK, TO SAY THIS IS GAY. OR "I WISH THE AMERICAN MEDIA WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE IN CONGRESS AND  FIND OUT ARE THEY PRO AMERICA OR ANTI-AMERICA?" OR "I BELIEVE THERE'S A STRONG  CHANCE WE WILL SEE YOUNG PEOPLE PUT INTO MANDATORY SERVICE. AND THE REAL CONCERN IS THAT THERE ARE PROVISIONS FOR WHAT I WOULD CALL RE-EDUCATION CAMPS  FOR YOUNG PEOPLE." (AUDIENCE REACTS) YOU WANT A PHOTO THAT MAKES HER SEEM A LITTLE OFF? MAKE IT OUT OF HER WORDS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO I SAY SHAME ON YOU! SHAME ON YOU, "NEWSWEEK" AND YOUR EDITOR TINA BROWN. NO, TOO GLAMOROUS. YEAH, GETTING THERE. THAT'S IT. WE'LL
