WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS WHOSE NEW FILM IS CALLED "THE DEEP BLUE SEA."
WHAT WOULD SHE NEED WITH A RATION BOOK?
THAT'S MINE.
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
IT'S FOR ME.
AND MR. PAGE?
IS NOT MY HUSBAND. BUT I WOULD RATHER YOU CONTINUE TO THINK OF ME AS MRS. PAGE.
ALL RIGHT.
Jon: HELLO. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM RACHEL WEISZ. [APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU?
I'M WELL, THANKS, HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: THIS FILM, THERE IS ANOTHER FILM, YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THIS, CALLED "THE DEEP  BLUE SEA."
WITH SHARKS.
A GIANT SHARK THAT WAS GIVE AN BRAIN INJECTION AND EATS L.L. COOL J. THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT FILM. WHAT IF WE HAD ENTER DEUCED A GIANT L.L. COOL J. EATING SHARK INTO THIS FILM?
MORE PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY GO AND SEE IT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL. THIS IS A WONDERFUL FILM. HOW DO YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS, BECAUSE THIS IS BASED ON PLAY, YES?
YEAH, IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE '50s, A BRITISH PLAY, WHICH I  NEVER READ, BUT YEAH, IT WAS.
Jon: SO YOU HAD NOT BEEN IN THE PLAY, YOU HAD NOT SEEN THE PLAY?
I HAD NOT READ IT OR SEEN IT, BUT IT WAS AN OLD BRITISH PLAY?
Jon: WAS IT SUCCESSFUL?
IT WAS IN THE '50s. IT'S JUST BECOME FASHIONABLE AGAIN, THIS PLAYWRIGHT, RATIGAN.
Jon: DOES HE HAVE OTHER STUFF THAT'S ABOUT TO BE PRODUCED? THEY'VE DISCOVERED A TREASURE TROVE OF HIS WORKS?
WELL, IT'S THE CENTENARY OF ITS BIRTH, SO BRITAIN IS HAVING A BIG RATIGAN FESTIVAL.
Jon: SURE. LISTEN, I...
I'M PUTTING YOU OFF HERE, AREN'T ANY
Jon: NO, NO, FOR HIS 80th WE DID A BIG RATIGAN FESTIVAL. IT WAS MOSTLY HIS NON-WORLD WAR II MELODRAMAS. THIS... HOW DO YOU EVEN BOUNCE AROUND FROM THESE PROJECTS. YOU DID THIS AND THE NEXT ONE WAS THE BOURNE SERIES OR SOMETHING.
"BOURNE LEGACY."
Jon: "BOURNE LEGACY." SO ONE IS THIS VERY CLAUSTROPHOBIC WORLD WAR II IN  THE MIDDLE OF THE BLITZ, AND THEN...
IT'S A VERY RARERY STORY. IT'S ABOUT A WOMAN HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A MUCH YOUNGER MAN. SHE LEAVES HER HUSBAND AND IT'S INCREDIBLY SHOCKING. I THINK EVEN TODAY IT WOULD BE QUITE SHOCKING. IT'S A RACY STORY ABOUT A WOMAN WHO DISCOVERS SEX AND LOVE AND PASSION. I SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT RATHER THAN THE CENTENARY OF RATIGAN. IT'S A LOT MORE INTERESTING.
Jon: YOU WERE ON A MUCH BETTER TRACK TALKING ABOUT CELEBRATING A DEAD PLAYWRIGHT. I REALLY THINK...
THAT'S GOING TO GET THEM IN.
Jon: THAT'S GOING TO GET THEM IN. THERE ARE MANY OF THESE... PEOPLE ALWAYS IN WORLD WAR II, A LOT OF THESE AWAKENING TYPE STORIES, YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE, OH, I'M GOING THROUGH MY WORK-A-DAY LIFE, AND SUDDENLY I'M OUT THERE, BABY. THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF WHEN I THINK OF WORLD WAR II, FOR THE MOST PART. THERE WERE SOME OTHER MINOR DETAILS.
A LOT OF WOMEN HAVING SEXUAL AWAKENINGS.
Jon: IS THIS FOR AN ACTRESS, THESE TYPES OF FILMS, YOU KNOW, I WOULD THINK ARE VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE TO TRANSLATE THE STAGE SO DEPENDS ON KIND OF  THE PHYSICAL PROXIMITY OF THE AUDIENCE AND THE FEEDBACK, FILM IS SUCH A DIFFERENT MEDIUM THAN  THAT, IS IT DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE WHAT YOU IMAGINE IS THE SPIRIT OF THIS THING WITHOUT THE LIVE ELEMENT?
YOU MEAN BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON A PLAY?
OH, NO, IT'S A FILM.
Jon: DIDN'T THAT SOUND LIKE A PRETTY, PRETTY...
IT WAS A REALLY SMART QUESTION.
Jon: IT SOUNDED LIKE, OH, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.
YOU'RE COMPARING FILM AND THEATER. BUT IF YOU SCREW IT UP, YOU GET TO DO IT AGAIN IF IT'S FILM.
Jon: YOU JUST BLEW MY  [BLEEPED] OUT OF THE WATER.
SORRY, JON.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS. DOING TV, RATHER THAN FILM, YOU'RE MUCH SMALLER WHEN YOU GO INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES.
YEAH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT IS THE... DO PEOPLE SAY... PEOPLE THINK I'M TALLER. NOW YOU ARE MY HEIGHT. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHEN WE STOOD, YOU WERE THE SAME.
I HAVE HEELS ON. JON JON YOU DON'T THINK I HAVE HEELS ON? [LAUGHTER] DUDE, I HAVE FAKE LEGS ON. [LAUGHTER] I'M LIKE DORF ON GOLF. IF I WAS REALLY STANDING HERE, YOU WOULD BE LIKE, HELLO, LITTLE MAN. BUT PEOPLE ALWAYS THINK I'M MUCH TALLER, WHICH IS... WHAT DID YOU DO? DID YOU DO ANYTHING FOR PORUM. PEOPLE ASK WHAT I DO. I WAS LIKE, I HAD A SANDWICH. DID YOU DO ANYTHING FOR THAT?
IT WAS MY BIRTH DATE THE FIRST NIGHT. I HAD A FEW PEOPLE OVER FOR DINNER, ONE OF WHOM WAS A JEW.
Jon: IS THAT HOW YOU INTRODUCED HER.
THIS IS MY FRIEND THE JEW. SHE BROUGHT OVER A HAMMOND'S EAR.
Jon: OR HIS HAT. ALL I KNOW IS IT'S GOT PRUNES IN IT OR FIGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
SO THAT WAS MY BIRTHDAY CAKE. I STUCK A CANDLE IN THAT. I HAD A LITTLE PORUM.
Jon: SO WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED A TRADITIONAL OR ORTHODOX PORUM.
YEAH, LIKE A KIND OF HASIDIC ALMOST, RIGHT?
Jon: I WONDER WHAT A WISH YOU WOULD MAKE ON THAT? I WISH MY BACK DIDN'T HURT. [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE SO...
THAT WAS TOO GOOD. THAT WAS TOO GOOD.
Jon: SO NOT GOOD. "THE DEEP BLUE SEA" OPENS IN NEW YORK AND L.A. ON MARCH 23rd. RACHEL WEISZ, A GIANT MAN-EATING SHARK AND FOR ALL YOU RATIGAN HEADS OUT THERE, ENJOY. RACHEL WEISZ.
