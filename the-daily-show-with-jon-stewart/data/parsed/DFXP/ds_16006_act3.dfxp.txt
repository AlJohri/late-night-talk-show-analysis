[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THIS MAN AN ACTOR. NOMINATED FOR A GOLDEN GLOBE FOR HIS LATEST FILM "THE KING'S SPEECH."
IN HERE IT'S BETTER IF WE'RE EQUAL.
THAT SAID IF WE WERE EQUALS, I WOULDN'T BE HERE. I WOULD BE AT HOME WITH MY WIFE AND WOULD NO -- AND NO ONE WOULD GIVE A DAMN.
PLEASE, DON'T DO THAT.
SORRY?
I BELIEVE SUCKING SMOKE INTO YOUR LUNGS WILL KILL YOU.
MY PHYSICIANS SAY IT RELAXES THE THROAT.
THEY ARE IDIOTS.
THEY ARE KNIGHTS.
MAKES IT OFFICIAL THEN.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM COLIN FIRNL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- COLIN FIRTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I KNOW YOU ARE UNDER THE WEATHER. I KNOW YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF LARYNGITIS.
IT'S MY VOICE IS A LITTLE HUSKY JOINCH APPRECIATE THE  SUFFERING YOU ARE GOING THROUGH. THIS IS THE FINEST THING YOU'VE DONE. OUT OF FINE THINGS --
I KNOW YOU HAVE WATCHED THEM ALL, RIGHT.
Jon: BECAUSE I HAVE AS YOU KNOW THE FIRTH FILM FESTIVAL EVERY YEAR.
THAT NOISE YOU MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW WAS THAT AN IMPRESSION OF ME?
Jon: NO.
BECAUSE IT'S SPOOKY IF IT WAS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I GO WAIT AM I ON THE SHOW?
IT WAS LIKE MY -- IT SOUNDED LIKE MY TABLE READ.
Jon: NOT AT ALL.
FROM WHAT YOU SAW THERE WAS AFTER A LONG PROCESS OF HONING IN ON THE CHARACTER.
Jon: IT IS SEAMLESS AND TERRIFIC. WHAT A GREAT STORY YET I'M AMAZED THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN TOLD TO THIS POINT. WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF SO MANY OF FILM GOERS FETISHES, WORLD WAR II, THE BROTHER OF EDWARD  THE VIII HOW HAVE WE NOT HEARD THE STORY OF GEORGE THE 6:00 VI BEFORE?
IT WAS THE UNDISCOVERED, FINALLY FIND THE PHARAOHS TOMB YOU WERE LOOKING FOR. THE FIGURES AFTER THIS ERA ARE SO COLORFUL, THE MAIN PROTAG INCONSISTENTS, HITLER, CHURCHILL, ROOSEVELT, DEGAULLE, MUSSOLINI. YOU HAVE SUCH CONVINCING VILLAIN S AND THIS SHY, RETIRING TIMID MAN THAT DIDN'T PUT  HIMSELF FORWARD. I THINK PEOPLE REALLY BLIPPED OVER HIM WHEN IT COMES TO THE BROAD STAGE.
Jon: EVEN HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN IT SEEMS.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM. WE KNEW HE EXISTED. THAT'S ABOUT IT REALLY. WE JUST GET CHURCHILL ALL THE TIME. [LAUGHTER] ALSO THE QUEEN MOTHER HELENA BONHAM CARTER WENT ON TO BECOME THE QUEEN MOTHER.
Jon: NOT REALLY.
GIVE HER TIME. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HE WAS MARRIED TO ELIZABETH --
THAT'S RIGHT ON HIS DEATH WHEN QUEEN ELIZABETH BECAME THE  QUEEN SHE THEN BECAME THE FAMOUS FIGURE THAT WE KNOW AS THE QUEEN MOTHER. OUR WRITER WAS A YOUNG BOY LISTENING TO THOSE BROADCASTS, THE KING'S BROADCASTS GROWING UP IN AMERICA HE HIMSELF SUFFERED FROM A SEVERE STUTTER. THOSE BROADCASTS GAVE HIM HOPE. IF THE KING OF ENGLAND CAN DO THAT -- HE WROTE TO THE QUEEN MOTHER LATER ASKING FOR HER  PERMISSION TO TELL THIS STORY. SHE SAID, PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS IN MY LIFETIME, THE MEMORIES OF THESE EVENTS ARE TOO PAINFUL. SEW WAITED AND WAITED -- SO HE WAIT AND WAITED. I WAS 1 WHEN HE WROTE THE LETTER.
Jon: SHE WAS A HARDY WOMAN THE QUEEN MUM.
FINALLY AT THE AGE OF 186 HE FELT FREE TO TELL THE STORY.
Jon: REALLY INCREDIBLE. YOU ALWAYS SOMETIMES YOU CAN LOOK AT HISTORY AND YOU THINK BOY JUST CHANGE ONE NEXUS POINT. IF HE EDWARD VIII HAD NOT ACT DATED -- ABDICATED IN THE MANNER HE HAD.
THERE'S NOT WANTING TO GO THERE.
Jon: DURING THE BOMBING OF LONDON HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, WE SHOULDN'T REALLY OVERTHROW  HITLER HE IS THE LEADER OF GERMANY. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE KING OF ENGLAND.
YEAH, I KNOW. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT -- IT BOGGLES THE MIND.
IT DOES. YOU KNOW, THERE WERE ALL THESE FOLKS IN EUROPE AT THAT TIME. HEAVEN KNOWS, GOODNESS KNOWS HOW MANY OF THEM ARE HAPPY ENDINGS BY THE SKIN OF THEIR TEETH. THERE WAS APPEASEMENT ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU KNOW, AND PEOPLE WHO WERE IN DENIAL ABOUT IT, ABOUT THE ARMS BUILD UP AND ABOUT WHAT OUR  ACTUAL RELATIONSHIP AS A COUNTRY WAS WITH GERMANY. AND ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, THAT -- THE ETHO, IS THAT GEORGE VI SET IN PLACE WHETHER ONE ACCEPTS THE  IDEA OF AN UNELECTED BODY IN THE CONSTITUTION AT ALL AS A COUNTRY, THAT SET IN PLACE IS  STILL THERE IN MANY WAYS. BECAUSE IT'S HIS DAUGHTER AND SHE'S STILL THERE. THE IDEA THAT YOUR ROLE IS NOT ONE OF PRIVILEGE BUT ONE OF BASIC DUTY ON A DAILY BASIS  WHERE IT'S, YOU KNOW, YOU PUT YOURSELF AT THE SERVICE OF YOUR PEOPLE ONE THAT HE DID IN  REACTION TO HIS BROTHER'S ATTITUDE.
Jon: I ALWAYS SEEMS TO WORK. WELL, I'M SO GLAD THAT I COMPLETELY RIDICULED HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW. BEAUTIFULLY SAID, SIR. BEAUTIFULLY ACTED AND CONGRATULATIONS ONCE AGAIN ON A TREMENDOUS PERFORMANCE. THE KING'S SPEECH, I URGE YOU. IT'S IN THEATERS
