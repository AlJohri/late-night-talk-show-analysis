FEBRUARY 22, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE'VE PLANNED A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT THAT I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS THE GREAT ANDERSON COOPER, HE'LL BE JOINING US. ANDERSON COOPER "360" DEGREES? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HIS SHOW IS A TITLE AND A RECIPE. (LAUGHTER) TAKE ANDERSON COOPER, THEN 360 DEGREES, ROAST. I HAVE THE BOUBON AGAIN. (LAUGHTER) IT'S THE SECOND TIME IN THREE MONTHS. LET ME SAY THIS TO ANYBODY OUT THERE WITH CHILDREN AT HOME. BUY AN AUTOCLAVE. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE... THEY SMEAR THINGS. (LAUGHTER) AND YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE JUST HAVING BREAKFAST. (LAUGHTER) YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT CREAM CHEESE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) OH, I'M SORRY, DID I MAKE YOU NAUSEOUS? (LAUGHTER) THE SEASON OF FISCAL DISCIPLINE. HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE DISCOVERING CUTTING SPENDING ISN'T AS EASY AS THEY HOPED. IT TURNS OUT PEOPLE LIKE SOME OF THE THINGS GOVERNMENT DOES FOR THEM. LUCKILY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE COME UP WITH A BRILLIANT IDEA. WHAT IF INSTEAD OF CULTING SERVICES FOR POOR PEOPLE, THEY CUT SERVICES FOR WOMEN?
$747 MILLION IN CUTS TO THE NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN.
CUTTING MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE HEAD START EDUCATION PROGRAM.
ONE OF THE BILLS ELIMINATES TAX BREAKS FOR PRIVATE EMPLOYERS  WHO PROVIDE HEALTH COVERAGE IF THEIR PLANS OFFER ABORTION SERVICES.
ALLOWING HOSPITALS TO REFUSE TO PERFORM AN ABORTION ON A WOMAN EVEN IF SHE'LL DIE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) (BOOS)
Jon: WOW, THAT'S SO PRO-LIFE EVEN IF IT KILLS YOU. (LAUGHTER) SO THEY WANT TO CUT EVERYTHING FROM FAMILY CARE TO PRENATAL CARE TO... (LAUGHTER) CHILD NUTRITION. IT'S LIKE THE REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING YOU CAN'T PREVENT AN  UNWANTED CHILD, YOU CAN'T GET CARE IF YOU DO GET PREGNANT AND WE WON'T GIVE YOU ANY HELP  FEEDING THE KID AFTER IT'S BORN. BUT THOSE TWO MINUTES WHEN THAT SKULL IS CROWNING, YOUR BABY'S THE MOST PRECIOUS THING ON EARTH. (LAUGHTER) MUCH OF THE G.O.P. FOCUS IS ON PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHICH, TO  HEAR THEM TELL IT, IS APPARENTLY IN THE ABORTION BUSINESS FOR AN UNUSUAL REASON.
PLANNED PARENTHOOD ISN'T ABOUT HEALTH, IT'S ABOUT PROFIT. THEIR FOCUS ON BECOMING BIG BUSINESS.
THEY REPORTED A $63 BILLION PROFIT.
THEY MAKE MONEY ON THE ABORTIONS.
Jon: THAT'S RIDICULOUS. EVERYONE KNOWS PLANNED PARENTHOOD DOESN'T MAKE MONEY ON THE ABORTIONS. IT'S THE CONCESSIONS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS. YOUR JUNIOR MINTS, YOUR NACHOS. WHO NEEDS THAT BIG A DRINK TO GO IN? PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S INSIDIOUS PROFITEERING DOES NOT END THERE.
THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD OPERATION IN MY STATE OF MINNESOTA SAID THEY RECENTLY  OPENED THREE EXPRESS CENTERS IN WELLESLEY MINNESOTA... WEALTHY MINNESOTA SUBURBS AND SHOPPING  CENTERS AND MALLS AND PLACES WHERE WOMEN ARE ALREADY DOING THEIR GROCERY SHOPPING, PICKING  UP STARBUCKS, LIVING THEIR DAILY LIVES AND STOPPING OFF FOR AN ABORTION. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SOME OF THEM AREN'T EVEN PREGNANT. (LAUGHTER) IT'S JUST SO DAMN CONVENIENT. IT'S LIKE THEM ANTIANN'S PREL SETHS. YOU'RE NOT PLANS ON EATING ONE BUT IT'S RIGHT ACROSS FROM ABERCROMBIE. I HAD NO IDEA WHY SO MANY... SO MANY MALL ABORTIONS WERE GOING ON. IS THAT WHY STORES HAVE THOSE NAMES LIKE LINENS AND THINGS, BED BATH & BEYOND DAVID AND... NOW, THE VAST MAJORITY OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD SERVICES ARE NON-ABORTION RELATED. THERE'S ALREADY A LAW IN PLACE TO HIDE AMENDMENTS THAT ENSURES NONE OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING IT  RECEIVES TO K GO TOWARDS ABORTIONS. THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND ITS DEFENDERS WILL CLAIM THE MONEY THEY'VE RECEIVED FROM THE  GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN USED TO FUND ABORTIONS. BUT THAT'S ONLY TECHNICALLY TRUE.
Jon: YES, TECHNICALLY TRUE. ALSO KNOWN AS TRUE. (LAUGHTER) BUT GO ON.
THERE'S NO QUESTION THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS RECEIVED BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD ARE USED TO  COVER ALLOWED EXPENSES LIKE OVERHEAD, OPERATIONAL COSTS, THUS FREEING UP OTHER MONEY FOR THE CLINICS THAT DO PROVIDE ABORTIONS.
IT'S LIKE A SHELL GAME. EXCEPT INSTEAD OF A BALL UNDERNEATH A WALNUT SHELL IT'S WOMB INSTEAD OF... (LAUGHTER) FOR MORE ON THE HOUSE'S DEFUNDING EFFORTS WE'RE JOINED  BY SENIOR WOMEN'S CORRESPONDENT CHRIS TAN. THANK YOU KRISTEN. LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, KRISTEN WE DISCUSSED THE HOUSE CONSERVATIVES MOVE TO REDUCE  FEDERALLY FUNDED ABORTIONS FOR RAPE VICTIMS BY REDEFINING THE TERM RAPE.
UH-HUH. WHICH WOULD HAVE TOTALLY WORKED IF THE REPUBLICANS HADN'T BACKED DOWN AT THE LAST MINUTE. THE PUSSIES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT MAY BE THE MOST CHILLING WAY I'VE EVER HEARD THAT PHRASE. LIKE FROM "SAW 3" OR SOMETHING. KRISTEN, ARE WE SEEING ARE WE SEEING BILLS THAT RESTRICT FUNDS FOR A BROADER SFLANG
IT WOULD DENY MILLIONS OF WOMEN ROUTINE CHECKUPS AND EXAMINATION, DEFUND  GYNECOLOGICAL EXAMS, U.T.I. TREATMENTS AND THE FULL PANOPLY OF WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD PROVIDES.
PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS RUNNING QUITE AN ELABORATE FRONT FOR ITS  ABORTION STORES BUT THE FACTS ARE WHAT MIKE PENCE SAID, IF AN ORGANIZATION HAS ANYTHING TO DO  WITH ABORTION THEN EVERYTHING THAT ORGANIZATION DOES IS TAINTED AS SHOULDN'T GET  GOVERNMENT MONEY.
Jon: SO YOU ARE COMING OUT IN SUPPORT OF THIS NEW HOUSE BILL?
YES. IF ANYTHING THEY DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH. OUR TAXES ARE GOING TO ABORTIONS IN WAYS NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT.
Jon: LET'S TALK ABOUT IT NOW. HOW?
WELL, FOR STARTERS WE HAVE TO CUT FUNDING FOR FIRE DEPARTMENTS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHY THAT WOULD BE?
HELLO! WHAT IS AN ABORTION... WHAT IF AN ABORTION CLINIC CATCHES FIRE AND FIREFIGHTERS PUT IT OUT  PAVING THE WAY FOR MORE ABORTIONS! ABORTIONIST FIREFIGHTERS PAID FOR WITH OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS.
Jon: IN THAT CASE WE'D HAVE TO DEFUND THE COAST GUARD  BECAUSE ABORTION PROVIDERS GO TO THE BEACH. (LAUGHTER)
I HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. NO MORE COAST GUARD. GIVE ME ANOTHER, THIS IS FUN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: F.A.A..
MILE-HIGH CLUB. NUMBER-ONE CAUSE OF UNWANTED PREGNANCIES BETWEEN NEWARK AND L.A.X. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: MINING SAFETY COMMISSION.
MILE BELOW CLUB. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
SEXY LIBRARIANS.
Jon: NASA.
SPACE ABORTIONS! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES.
JOHN, PLEASE, I AM GETTING PREGNANT JUST LISTENING TO YOU. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: KRISTEN, IF YOU TRY HARD ENOUGH... THAT'S THE BOUBONS TALKING. YOU COULD LINK ABORTION TO ANY PIECE OF SPENDING.
EXACTLY. IT'S DISGUSTING. HOW CAN MIKE PENCE BE SURE WHEN HE PAYS MONEY FOR SOMETHING IT WON'T ULTIMATELY GO TO PAY FOR  AN ABORTION.
Jon: THERE'S NO WAY TO GUARANTEE.
THERE IS NOW. PRESENTING DORK BOX. A PRO LIVE CURRENCY THAT CAN'T BE SPENT ON ANYTHING HAVINGING TO DO WITH ABORTIONS. HERE, TRY TO BUY SOMETHING FROM ME. OR FOR ME IF YOU WANT TO YOU CAN DO THAT.
Jon: HELLO.
HELLO.
Jon: I'D LIKE TO BUY A CUP OF COFFEE WITH MY STORK BUCKS.
OH, WOULD YOU?
Jon: YES. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHAT'S WRONG WITH COFFEE?
IT HAS CAFFEINE THE DRUG THAT KEEPS ABORTION DOCTORS AWAKE SO  THEY CAN PERFORM ABORTIONS ALL NIGHT LONG. I DON'T THINK SO.
Jon: YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DO NOT... LISTEN, IT'S A DELICATE ISSUE. PEOPLE ARE NOT GLEEFUL ABOUT PERFORMING ABORTIONS. THEY'RE NOT GLEEFUL ABOUT THE... OH, GOD, WHAT ARE THESE MADE OF BY THE WAY, THEY SEEM VERY FLAMMABLE.
JUST TREE PULP, GUN POWDER AND STORK MEAT. AFTER THE WHOLE B.P. THING, THE STORK MEAT JUST REALLY LIGHTS UP. STORK COVERED IN OIL.
Jon: KRISTEN, EVERYONE OBJECTS TO SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS MONEY ON. I MAY NOT WANT MY TAXES PAYING FOR WATERBOARDING OR SUBSIDIES OR MIKE PENCE'S PROSTATE EXAMS  BUT THERE GOES MY MONEY.
STRAIGHT UP MIKE PENCE'S ASS, I KNOW. (LAUGHTER) UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE SPENDING MY NEW CURRENCY SUNSHINE BUCKS! THEY DON'T GO WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE. 230 HAS MIKE PENCE'S PROSTATE ON IT. DO WE HAVE THAT IMAGE?
