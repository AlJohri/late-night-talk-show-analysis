Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. DID I HAVE A NICE VACATION? YOU KNOW, THIS TIME I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO COME BACK TO WORK BECAUSE WE HAD A DOOZY TEED UP HERE. A LITTLE STORY ABOUT A CONGRESSMAN, TWITTER ACCOUNT AND A PHOTO OF WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT  HAVE BEEN HIS (bleep).
HE CAME FROM CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY WEINER'S TWITTER ACCOUNT OVER THE WEEKEND. A PHOTO OF AN ANONYMOUS MAN'S BULGING UNDERWEAR. THE PICTURE IMMEDIATELY DELETED FROM HIS ACCOUNT WAS SENT TO THIS 21-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE STUDENT.
Jon: YOU KNOW. THAT'S THE PICTURE RIGHT THERE. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THIS TWITTER IS SOMETHING ELSE. YOU KNOW IN THE OLD DAYS A CONGRESSMAN HAD TO CHISEL IMAGES OF HIS PENIS ON LIMESTONE. AND THEN HAVE A RUNNER TAKE THE PICTURE TO WHICHEVER DAMSEL THEY WANTED TO HOAR FIVE. HERE IS MY DILEMMA. ONE, WE NEWS BASED COMEDY STORY LOOKING AT A STORY ABOUT A SNAP SHOT THAT APPEARS TO BE AN AMPLE  HELPING OF PENIS --  [LAUGHTER] -- ALLEGEDLY POSTED BY A CONGRESSMAN WHOSE SAME IN A SYNONYM FOR PENIS. FOR A PROGRAM LIKE THIS THE PHRASE SWEET SPOT BRINGS TO MIND. [LAUGHTER] IF WE WERE TO HAVE A WHEELHOUSE, THIS WHEELHOUSE WOULD BE WHERE THIS STORY WOULD RECEIVE ITS MAIL. [LAUGHTER] GET ITS CALL. THIS WOULD BE THIS STORYIES BUILDING ADDRESS. THAT WOULD BE LET'S DO THIS STORY CATEGORY. THE CONS OF THIS STORY IS THIS IS MY FRIEND ANTHONY. NOT THIS BUT THIS. THIS GUY IS A FRIEND OF MINE AND CONTRARY TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTING WE WERE NEVER  ROOMMATES BUT 25 YEARS AGO HE AND SOME FRIEND OF MINE FROM COLLEGE HAD A HOUSE AT DEWEY  BEACH THINK JERSEY SHORES MEETS YENTL. WHEN I WASN'T BAR TENDING OR CLEARING PLATES OFF I WOULD HEAD DOWN FOR FREE LOADERS WEEKEND. JONNY DOESN'T CHIP IN THEY WOULD CALL ME AFFECTIONATELY OR SO I CONVINCED MYSELF. AS A COMEDIAN THIS IS SAY SLAM DUNK. WEINER NAME, WEINER PICTURE. WHERE'S MY CHECK. I WOULD -- AS A FRIEND OF HIS, I HAVE MY DOUBTS ABOUT THE VERACITY. MY THOUGHTS STEM FROM THIS. NO WAY NEW YORK CITY (bleep) WAY. SERIOUSLY. NO WAY! NO WAY! IN REAL LIFE MY MEMORY IS THIS CAT HAD A LOT MORE ANTHONY AND A LOT LESS WEINER. THIS IS NOT WHAT I REMEMBER. [LAUGHTER] TO BE FAIR, MUCH OF OUR TIME TOGETHER WAS SPENT SWIMMING IN THE FRIGID WATERS OF THE  ATLANTIC OCEAN WHICH AS MANY OF YOU HAS A NOTORIOUS SMALLENNING EFFECT REFERRED TO AS THE  PHENOMENON AS EL PINO. GO OWE TO THE PACIFIC IT'S A BOTTLENOSE. IN THE ATLANTA YOU GET A DOLPHIN WHO IS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I SWEAR TO GO THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE. [LAUGHTER] DOLPHINS ARE ALSO OLD JEWS. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU THE ONLY THING THAT ANTHONY AND THIS GENTLEMAN HERE APPEAR  TO HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY BOTH LEAN HARD TO THE EXTREME LEFT. BOOM! BOOM! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CUT ME, MICK. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THIS IS. I I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING ON. I HOPE IT'S NOT FOR REAL. HE INSISTS HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT WAS HACKED. I NEED A TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS, MAYBE THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS TO BRING SOME INSIGHTFUL REPORTAGE FOR THIS.
THIS BECOME THE SUBJECT OF A SERIOUS WAR BETWEEN LIBERAL BLOGS SUGGESTING IT'S A  CONSPIRACY AND OTHERS QUESTIONING THE HKING CLAIM.
THEY COULD CALL THE CAPITOL POLICE OR THE F.B.I. AND SAY COME ON IN AND LAUNCH AN  INVESTIGATION BECAUSE I WAS HACKED. WHY HASN'T HE DONE THAT?
WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. I ASKED CONGRESSMAN WEINER'S PRESS SECRETARY ABOUT IT TODAY. I DIDN'T GET A RESPONSE.
Jon: I GUESS THAT'S THE END OF IT. THE LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE BLOGS HAVING AN ALL-OUT WAR THEY ARE PROBABLY NOT DOING ANYTHING  ABOUT THE STORY EXCEPT SHOWING THAT THE TAGS FROM THE PHOTO DON'T MUCH THE CAMERA HE USES. IT SHOWS NO SIGNS OF MANIPULATION BUT IT'S ODD THAT THE ONLY PERSON WHO SAW THE  TWEET HAS A HISTORY OF SENDING HARASSING MESSAGES TO THE WOMAN WHO RECEIVED THE TWEET. THAT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE REPORTING SLOWDOWN WOOD WOODWARD AND BLOGSTEIN. LET THE BIG GUYS HANDLE WITH WITH THEIR TRADEMARK I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LET A GUY COME ON SAYING HE IS A SEXUAL PREDATOR PARTICULARLY IF THE  ACCUSER IS ONE WHO HAS SWORN TO DESTROY THE LEFT.
GIRLS QUITE YOUNG, YOUNGER THAN THE GIRL IN QUESTION HERE TALK ABOUT REP WEINER.
WE'LL PUT THOSE QUESTIONS TO THE REPRESENTATIVE, HE IS NOT ON  THE SHOW NOW TO ASK HIM ABOUT THANK YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THEM. YOU DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO CALL YOU BACK. YOU CAN DO LIKE AN -- WHAT DO YOU CALL IT -- INVESTIGATION USING SOME TYPE OF -- I DON'T  KNOW -- JOURNALISM. YOU CAN DO THE INVESTIGATIONS BEFORE HE COMES ON THE TV. AND -- I'M SORRY THAT'S NOT ME TALKING THAT'S MY ANGER AT THIS. SERIOUSLY. I MEAN -- (bleep) IT'S NOT THAT BIG! [LAUGHTER] IT CAN'T
