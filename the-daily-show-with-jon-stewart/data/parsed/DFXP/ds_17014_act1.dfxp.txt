NOVEMBER 1, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART! WE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO GIVE IT AWAY. WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST TONIGHT, I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE IT AWAY. WE'LL... I'LL GIVE YOU A SMALL CLUE. HER FIRST NAME IS CONTINUE LEE SAA. OTHER THAN THAT IT COULD BE ANYBODY. CONDOLEEZZA. OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT, AMERICA'S ONGOING ECONOMIC WOES.
AS OUR NATION'S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES CONTINUE TO BE DEFINED, AS A STRUGGLE BETWEEN  THOSE BUSINESSES WHOSE MONUMENTAL LOSSES WERE COVERED BY TARP AND THOSE WHOSE RAMEN  NOODLES AND HACKKY SACKS WERE ALSO COVERED BY TARP. BUT THROUGH IT ALL, IT'S EASY TO FORGET THE REAL VICTIMS OF THIS  EPIC BATTLES-- THE FEELINGS OF THE WINNERS.
SINCE WHEN IN THIS COUNTRY WAS IT OKAY TO DEMONIZE SUCCESS?
THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM IS UNDER ATTACK.
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS GOING TO HAVE TO STOP BASHING THE RICH.
DEMONIZING SUCCESS.
GOING AFTER THE RICH AND STOKEING THE RICH BACK TO THE OLD POPULOUS.
WHY VILIFY THE TOP 1%? THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SAVE ANYBODY BY VILIFYING THEM.
Jon: YOU PEOPLE DON'T GET IT. WHAT PART OF MO MONEY MO PROBLEMS DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? (LAUGHTER) THERE IS THAT FEELING, TOO.
AN OP-ED COLUMNIST IN FROM THE "NEW YORK TIMES" RECEIVED  THESE PHOTOS SNAPPED AT A HALLOWEEN PARTY LAST YEAR. THEY WERE ACTUAL EMPLOYEES AT THE STEPHEN J. BALM LAW FIRM NEAR BUFFALO, NEW YORK. IT'S A LAW FIRM THAT REPRESENTS BANKS WHEN THEY WANT TO FORECLOSE ON SOMEONE'S HOME. AS YOU CAN SEE, THE WORKERS ARE DRESSED UP AS HOMELESS PEOPLE. AND SQUATTERS.
DOT DOT DOT, DOT DOT DOT. BREAKING NEWS, DOT DOT DOT. SOME FORECLOSURE LAWYERS ARE GIANT DICKS. DOT, DOT, DOT. DOT, DOT, DOT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOR MORE ON WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THE MINDS OF THE 1% WE  TURN TO JOHN HODGMAN AND HIS NEW SEGMENT "MONEY TALKS."
JAPANESE YEN, WHAT IS THIS THE '80 WHERE'S? PLEASE SIR, CAN I HAVE SO MORE... MONEY? BOW BEFORE YOUR GOD!
MONEY TALKS.
Jon: WELCOME BACK, JOHN, NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: YOU'VE CHANGED THE NAME OF YOUR SEGMENT TO "MONEY TALKS."
YES.
Jon: WHY IS THAT?
WELL, JON, YOU SEE, THE WEALTHY ARE UNDER ATTACK IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SO TONIGHT I, JOHN K. HODGMAN, MILLIONAIRE, WILL STAND FOR THEM.
Jon: I SEE, SO YOU CONSIDER THE WEALTHY A PERSECUTED MINORITY.
OH, OF COURSE. WE'RE ONLY 1%. (LAUGHTER) WE'RE COMPLETELY OUTNUMBERED. EVEN YOUR PEOPLE, THE JEWS, WHAT IS IT, 2%? 3%? HOW MANY OF THERE ARE YOU?
Jon: WE... WE GET NERVOUS WHEN PEOPLE START COUNTING, ACTUALLY. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, YOU SEEM TO BE EVERYWHERE. HATING THE WEALTHY, THOUGH, IS THE LAST ACCEPTABLE PREJUDICE IN THIS COUNTRY.
Jon: THAT'S RICK DID LOUK! WHAT?
Jon: I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT IN MY WAY, SHAPE OF FORM.
GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE. BECAUSE THE REG DISAS I HOLD HAS NOT BEEN SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE FOR MANY YEARS. A LOT OF TONGUE BITING IN MY COMPOUND. LUCKILY I HAVE A GREAT MEXICAN FELLOW WHO BITE MISTONGUE FOR ME.
Jon: LET ME STOP YOU THERE, JOHN. WHO IS ATTACKING THE WEALTHY?
WELL, YOU KNOW, THE CLASS WARRIORS, PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN WIN THE GAME BY DEMONIZING  WHOLE GROUPS OF AMERICANS.
Jon: WHO'S DOING THAT?
THE MOOCHERS. THE PARASITES. THE LIBERALS. THE OLD PEOPLE. CHILDREN. TEACHERS. NURSES. FIREMEN. THE UNDERCLASS. THE NON-PRODUCERS.
Jon: SEE, JOHN, RIGHT THERE.
WHAT?
Jon: WHEN THE ONE PERCENTERS...
WE PREFER THE TERM "MONEYED AMERICANS." (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO CALL OTHER AMERICANS MOOCHERS OR THE ENTITLEMENT CLASS...
YES, THAT'S CORRECT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BUT WHEN INDIVIDUALS SUGGEST THAT THE GAME MAY BE RIGGED...
RIGD? OUTRAGEOUS! WHEN SOMEONE REACHES MY LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT, EVERYONE SHARES IN MY SUCCESS.
Jon: BUT NOT EACH SHARES IN THE MONEY.
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S MINE. THAT'S MY MONEY. (LAUGHTER) I MADE IT ALL MYSELF WITH NOBODY'S HELP.
Jon: NOT POSSIBLE. THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MY INSPIRING STORY. BOYS? ♪ ♪
Jon: WHO ARE THEY?
THEY'RE THE FAMOUS YALE WHIFFENPOOFS.
Jon: WHY DID DO THEY WHIFF YOU?
CONSIDER THEM THE RICH MAN'S CHORUS. JOHN HODGMAN CAME FROM NOTHING TO BE ONE OF THE RICHEST, MOST POWERFUL MEN ON TELEVISION. ♪ HE CAME FROM NOTHING... ♪
Jon: YOU WERE RAISED IN AN AFFLUENT SUBURB.
I CAME FROM NOWHERE, JOHN. ♪ HE CAME FROM NOWHERE... ♪
Jon: YOU WENT TO YALE.
YES, I DID, BUT I GOT IN DESPITE THE FACT THAT ONLY ONE OF MY PARENTS HAD PREVIOUSLY  ATTENDED YALE. ♪ NOT A LEGACY... ♪
THE SAD FACT IS MY FATHER WENT TO BOSTON COLLEGE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SING THE...
NO, THEY REFUSE TO SING THOSE WORDS, JON. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S A JESUIT SCHOOL. ANY WAY, AGAINST ALL ODDS, JOHN HODGMAN SITS BEFORE YOU A SELF-MADE MILLIONAIRE TELEVISION STAR. ♪ HE HAS HIS OWN COMPUTER APPS ♪
THEY HELPED A LITTLE BIT. ♪ WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THOSE ♪
THAT'S ENOUGH, HUMAN MICROPHONE!
Jon: JOHN, THE WEALTHY ARE ONLY BEING ASKED TO ALLOW THEIR TOP TAX CRATES TO INCREASE BY  4.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS.
UNACCEPTABLE! WHY SHOULD I BE PUNISHED BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY TOO LAZY TO ACCIDENTALLY BECOME  TELEVISION STARS LIKE HE? BESIDES, I GET BACK ALL THE TIME. I PAY SCHOOL TAXES. I'M ASSESSED FOR STREET REPAIRS. $115 FOR HOTELS? WHO ELSE HOLDS THE BEAUTY PAGEANTS? WHO ELSE TAKES STRANGERS' BABIES AND WALKS THEM AROUND THE BOARD WALK.
Jon: NO ONE IS SUGGESTING... (LAUGHTER) ... THAT YOU'RE HELPING THE MONOPOLY GAME ISN'T APPRECIATED  BUT IT'S DRACONIAN. THE LAST 40 YEARS HAVE SEEN A CHANGE IN WEALTH AND EQUALITY. I THINK PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT COME MORE IN LINE WITH THE WAY THAT...
OH, NOW YOU'VE DONE IT, JON. NOW YOU'VE HURT MY FEELINGS. AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. I'M NOT ALONE.
JOB CREATORS ARE ESSENTIALLY ON STRIKE.
IF BARACK OBAMA BEGINS TAXING ME MORE THAN 60%-- WHICH IS VERY  POSSIBLE-- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I'M GOING TO DO THIS.
IF YOU RAISE MY TAXES MAYBE I'LL JUST DECIDE TO SELL MY BUSINESS AND FIRE 150 PEOPLE.
Jon: BUT THAT'S... THAT IS INCREDIBLY CHILDISH.
WELL, THERE YOU GO AGAIN, DEMONIZING THE RICH. YOU FORCE MID-HAND, JON. WHIFFENPOOFS, YOUR JOX ARE UNCREATED. YOU'RE FIRED. ♪ WE HAVE TO FIND A JOB... ♪
YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU WENT TO YALE AND MAJORED IN A CAPPELLA. GET OUT. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE THOUGHT BEHIND THIS. SO THE IDEA IS IF YOU FEEL INSULTED AND UNAPPRECIATED YOU'LL JUST QUIT EVEN THOUGH  YOU'RE DOING WELL.
OF COURSE. IT'S THE PRINCIPLE HERE. INSTEAD OF BEING VILIFIED, WE MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES SHOULD BE CELEBRATED FOR THE  INSPIRATION WE PROVIDE. WE EMBODY THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT IF YOU WORK HARD AND MAKE SACRIFICES ALL PEOPLE CAN BE  PART OF THE 1%. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW THAT IS MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
OR MAYBE YOU'RE JUST NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH.
Jon: IT IS MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR 100% OF PEOPLE TO BE PART OF THE TOP 1%.
JON, JON, SHH. (LAUGHTER) BITE YOUR TONGUE ON THAT ONE. OH, I COULD HAVE MY MAN JORGE BITE YOUR TONGUE. HE'S VERY GENTLE.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JOHN. JOHN HODGMAN, EVERYBODY. BY THE WAY, HIS NEW BOOK "THAT IS ALL" IS AVAILABLE TODAY, COINCIDENTALLY. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
