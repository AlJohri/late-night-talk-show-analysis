MARCH 14, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WHAT'S UP? WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, RACHEL WEISZ, STAR OF "THE DEEP BLUE SEA," BUT I BRING YOU GREETINGS TONIGHT FROM LEBANON VIA GERMANY. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE BROAD INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT WE HAVE HERE, LEBANON VIA GERMANY, OR AS WE'RE REFERRING TO IT NOW, LEBARNANY, GERMANON. LAST NIGHT WAS OBVIOUSLY TUESDAY NIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. ONCE MORE ON TO THE BREECH OF ENDLESS SUFFRAGE 2012 AS VOTERS IN ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, HAWAII  AND AMERICAN SAMOA HEADED TO THE POLLS TO SELECT THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT, AND THE  BIG STORY LINE WAS...
IT IS MAKE-OR-BREAK NIGHT FOR NEWT GINGRICH.
THIS COULD BE GINGRICH'S LAST STAND.
IF GINGRICH LOSES EITHER OF THESE SOUTHERN STATES, WHERE CAN HE WIN?
IF YOU CAN'T WIN THERE, YOU CAN'T WIN ANYWHERE.
HIS RATIONALE FOR MOVING FORWARD STARTS TO SLIP AWAY.
NEWT HAS TO HAVE THE SOUTH.
OH, IT APPEARS WE HAVE A GENTLEMAN CALLER AND HIS HEAD IS ENORMOUS. [IN SOUTHERN ACCENT] SO DID NEWT WIN THE SOUTH? WELL, ACTUALLY RICK SANTORUM WON ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI, AND MITT ROMNEY WON HAWAII AND  AMERICAN SAMOA. HERE'S A LITTLE MNEMONIC DEVICE TO HELP YOU REMEMBER. PLACES YOU CAN GET TO IN A WINNEBAGO GO TO SANTORUM. PLACES THAT REQUIRE A JET OR A YACHT GO TO ROMNEY. [LAUGHTER] ROMNEY, OF COURSE... [APPLAUSE] ROMNEY ALWAYS DOES WELL WITH ISLANDS. THAT'S WHERE HIS MONEY LIVES. SO GINGRICH DID NOT GET THE THING THAT HE HAD TO HAVE, THUS DOOMING HIS ONCE-PROMISING CAMPAIGN. HIS HUMBLE CONCESSION LAST NIGHT WAS HALLMARK OF AMERICAN... OH, JUST [BLEEPED] IT. HE'S ACTING LIKE HE WON.
ONE OF THE THINGS TONIGHT PROVED IS THAT THE ELITE MEDIA'S  EFFORT TO CONVINCE THE NATION THAT MITT ROMNEY IS INEVITABLE JUST COLLAPSED. WE WILL NOW HAVE THREE OR FOUR DAYS OF THE NEWS MEDIA SAYING, WHY DOESN'T GINGRICH QUIT.
Jon: THESE ARE SOME OF THE NATION'S BRIGHTEST MINDS WHO  CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY I, NEWT GINGRICH, WON'T QUILT. WAS IT A PROMISE TO A SICK CHILD? WAS HE TOLD BY A WIZARD IF HE DOESN'T STAY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE THE WORLD WILL FALL INTO DARKNESS? IS NEWT'S CAMPAIGN SOME KIND OF JOAQUIN PHOENIX PERFORMANCE ART  THAT, I DON'T KNOW, WE'LL EVENTUALLY GET BUT STILL IN THE LIKE OR THINK WAS THAT FUNNY? MY POINT IS I'M NOT QUITTING. NEWT 2012! YOU'LL SEE. YOU'LL ALL SEE. [LAUGHTER] WHY WON'T GINGRICH QUIT? BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, HE'S ACTUALLY KIND OF WINNING.
THE FACT IS IN BOTH STATES, THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATES GOT NEARLY 70% OF THE VOTE. BETWEEN SANTORUM AND MYSELF, WE WILL GET OVER TWO-THIRDS OF THE DELEGATES AND THE SO-CALLED  FRONT-RUNNER WILL GET LESS THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE DELEGATES.
Jon: RIGHT, BUT YOU DON'T GET TO ADD SANTORUM'S SUM TO YOURS TO MAKE IT SOUND IMPRESSIVE. YOU KNOW, BETWEEN ME AND LeBRON JAMES LAST NIGHT, WE SCORED 36 POINTS. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S NOT YOUR TOTAL! AND YOU KNOW IF YOU ADD ROMNEY'S DELEGATES TO MINE, I'VE ACTUALLY WON. [LAUGHTER] BUT WHAT ABOUT SANTORUM, THE VICTOR? HOW DID HE TAKE THE NEWS OF HE AND GINGRICH'S CO-VICTORY?
THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT ORDINARY FOLKS DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS.
Jon: REALLY? I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT NBC'S "HEROES" WAS ABOUT. DO YOU HAVE AN INDESTRUCTIBLE CHEERLEADER, AS WELL? OF COURSE, AT OUR SHOW THE MAIN ATTRACTION OF PRIMARY NIGHT WAS GETTING TO SEE THE NEWS NETWORKS  STRUT THEIR THANG. HOW DID THINGS GO AT MSNBC?
REPUBLICANS ARE HAVING A THREE-WAY IN MISSISSIPPI. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OH, BOY.
I, OF COURSE, AM CALLING IT A THREE-WAY. BASED ON EVERYTHING YOU'VE JUST HEARD, WHERE...
WELL...
DO YOU WANT THE TAKE A BREATH?
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE CALLING IT A THREE WAY IS BREATH TAKING ENOUGH.
NOTHING IS MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN RICK SANTORUM IS BEING IN A THREESOME TO BE SURE.
WITH TWO VERY HANDSOME MEN.
IT WAS LIKE HAVING BRUNCH WITH FRIENDS YOU WENT TO OBERLIN WITH TEN YEARS AGO AND HALF-WAY  THROUGH BREAKFAST YOU SUDDENLY WONDER, WHY THE HELL AM I STILL FRIENDS WITH THESE PEOPLE. AND WHAT OF FOX? THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THEIR TEAM. WHILE I IMAGINE IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM WATCHING THEIR OWN PARTY TEAR ITSELF TO PIECE, THEY  DID THEIR BEST TO COVER IT.
WE WANT TO GET RIGHT TO THE TOP STORY, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SINKING POLL NUMBERS.
Jon: OR THEY COULD GO THAT WAY. [LAUGHTER] YES, LAST NIGHT WHILE THE OTHER NETWORKS DEVOTED MOST OF THEIR COVERAGE TO THE REPUBLICAN  PRIMARIES, FOX DECIDED TO PREEMPT IT WITH STANDARD TUESDAY NIGHT FARE.
WHY ARE LIBERALS OUTRAGED AT THE IDEA PEOPLE THINK IT'S MUSLIM? IS IT BAD TO BE A MUSLIM?
JANE FONDA AND BARBARA STREISAND ALL BY THEMSELVES COULD BUY BIRTH CONTROL FOR  EVERY POOR WOMAN IN AMERICA.
ALL THIS WAS, WAS AN ATTEMPT TO SMEAR GOVERNOR PALIN, CONSERVATIVES.
THIS IS HOW THE LEFT IS SPENDING THEIR TIME TRYING TO MANIPULATE US, AND WE'RE OVER IT. GCB -- GOOD CHRISTIAN "BITCHES."
IF THEY HAD REPLACED THAT CHRISTIAN WITH MUSLIM, FIRST OF ALL, IT WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN  TO BE A PILOT, NO ONE WOULD HAVE ACTED IN IT. THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SUED.
THIS IS CATERING TO THE DUMB DESIRES OF VEHICULAR VOLVO-DRIVING DUMB LEFTIES.
I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU. I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT FOX WAS GOING FOR WITH ALL THOSE  CLIPS, SO LET ME SEE IF I CAN CAN TRANSLATE THEM FOR EVERYBODY. [CRYING]
Jon: FOX NEWS, FAIR AND COLICKY. BUT AS ELECTION NIGHT BELONGED TO CNN, THE MOST DESPERATE NAME IN NEWS, WHICH ONCE GUN UNVEILED  AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON THE SENSES, EMPLOYING THE FULL POWER OF THEIR RAZZLE-DAZZLE-TRONS AND  REAL-TIME MAKE-UP TECHNOLOGY. YOU THINK DAVID GERGEN WAKES UP LOOKING LIKE THAT? NO. IT TAKES WORK, PEOPLE. BUT FOR CNN, IT WAS ALL ABOUT RESULTS.
RIGHT NOW CNN BALLOT CAMERAS ARE STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED IN  ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI TO BRING YOU THE RESULTS FROM THOSE CONTESTS BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.
WE'RE WATCHING THE NUMBERS VERY, VERY CLOSELY.
NO ONE IS WATCHING THEM MORE CLOSELY THAN OUR OWN JOHN KING.
WE DON'T HAVE OFFICIAL RESULTS IN. CNN IS GETTING THESE IN FRONT OF THE OFFICIAL RESULTS. WE HAVE THE MOST CREWS AND IN THE MOST LOCATIONS INCLUDING OUR CORRESPONDENTS COVERING THE CAMPAIGN. WE'LL BE WAY AHEAD OF ALL THE OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATIONS IN SHARING THESE NUMBERS.
WE'LL HAVE ALL THE NUMBERS! 53, 28, EVERYONE'S FAVORITE, 17. [LAUGHTER] NO OTHER NETWORK COMES CLOSE. WE HAVE SEVEN. WHAT DO THEY HAVE? HOW FAR WAS CNN WILLING TO GO TO GET YOU PARTIAL MISSISSIPPI DISTRICT VOTING NUMBERS A FULL  MINUTE BEFORE THE OTHER NETWORKS? PRETTY FAR.
MY GOOD FRIEND DANNY HERE, DANNY GLASSCOX.
Jon: GO ON.
DANNY HERE WAS ABOUT TO PRINT ME SOME EVEN FRESHER NUMBERS, AS  FRESH AS HE CAN GIVE THEM TO US. DANNY, HOW ARE YOU COMING ALONG IN TERMS OF... WE GOT A FRESH REPORT COMING OUT NOW?
Jon: WHY DON'T YOU GET OFF GLASCOX. THE I GO'S WORKING. STOP BREAKING HIS GLASS BALLS. I TELL YOU SOMETHING, I RALLY HOPE BREAKING THIS GUY'S GLASS BALLS IS WORTH IT.
WOLF, IF WE STAND BY FOR JUST A FEW SECOND, I CAN GIVE YOU EVEN FRESHER NUMBERS THAN THAT. HE'S PUTTING A TITLE ON THE REPORT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THESE ARE UNOFFICIAL  AND... OKAY. WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU WHEN WE GET FRESHER NUMBERS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE IT'S A CNN EXCLUSIVE ON THE LACK OF FRESHER NUMBERS. YOU WANT HEAR ABOUT THESE UNOFFICIAL NON-EXISTENT NUMBERS ANY PLACE ELSE. HOW INSANE WAS CNN'S ALL-INCLUSIVE WOLF CRYING WOLF ABOUT THE FRESHNESS OF CNN'S NUMBERS? WHEN IT CAME TIME TO DECLARE THE RACES, A.K.A. THE MATTERRERRING THING, CNN WAS BEATING TO THE  PUNCH BY THE NETWORK THAT SMEAT MOST OF THEIR NIGHT NOT COVERING THE PRIMARIES. IN FACT, IT WAS ONE MOMENT THAT CRYSTALLIZED CNN'S COVERAGE. IF YOU SAW RICK SANTORUM'S PEACH, YOU MAY HAVE CAUGHT THE MOMENT WHERE IN THE MIDST OF  CELEBRATING HIS ALABAMA WIN, HE GETS SOME BREAKING NEWS OFF STAGE THAT HE'S ALSO WON MISSISSIPPI.
WE DID? GREAT.
Jon: LOOK AT THAT. A GENUINE HUMAN MOMENT. YOU SELDOM GET TO SEE THAT KIND OF EMOTION IN THE HEAT OF A CAMPAIGN. HE'S GENUINELY TOUCHED AND FLUSTERED, AND HERE'S HOW CNN FOLLOWED UP THE MOMENT.
SOME HAVE CALLED TO SAY MISSISSIPPI FOR RICK SANTORUM. WE HAVE NOT YET. 96% OF THE VOTE IN.
RIGHT NOW 96% OF THE VOTE IN MISSISSIPPI. WE HAVE NOT YET MADE A PROJECTION, BUT IT'S LOOKING VERY, VERY GOOD FOR RICK SANTORUM.
JON: YOU BETTER MAKE A PROJECTION, MISTER. YOU'VE BEEN PESTERING YOUNG MASTER GLASCOX ALL NIGHT LONG. NOW YOU DECIDE TO GET CAUTIOUS? THE CANDIDATE IS MAKING OUT WITH HIS WIFE, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
