Jon: WELCOME BACK. LAST NIGHT ON OUR PROGRAM WE TOLD YOU HOW PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA TOLD RUSSIAN  PRESIDENT MEDVEDEV-- EDEV THAT HE WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO RENEGOTIATE THE  MISSILE DEFENSE BUT ONLY -- -- OF COURSE HE WAS MICKED WHEN HE SAID THAT KIND OF  EMBARRASSING SLIP-UP, A GAFFE. THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW SEGMENT JON STEWART EXAMINES OTHER MEN'S BONERS. NO, IS THAT SHALL DID -- THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE NAME OF THE SEGMENT. CAN WE PLEASE-- LET'S CHANGE THIS BEFORE THE SHOW AIRS. IS-- GOOD, THANK YOU. YOU WILL EDIT OUT THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION AS WELL, RIGHT, PERFECT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD. WE BEGIN WITH OUR NEW SEGMENT GAFFE-WATCH, THAT IS THE EDIT POINT RIGHT THERE  AND THAT WILL BE SEAMLESS WHEN PEOPLE WATCH IT AT HOME, RIGHT, THEY WON'T-- THEY WON'T SEE THE BONER PART. RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO FAKE LOOK IN THIS BIT. (LAUGHTER) AMAZINGLY OBAMA'S GAFFE GAVE BIRTH TO A SECOND GAFFE FROM ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL. THIS FROM THE MOUTH OF ONE MITWORTH WILLARD ROMNEY UNY THE FOURTH.
HE IS PLAN ON DOING MORE AND SUGGESTS TO RUSSIA THAT HE HAS THINGS HE'S WILLING  TO DO WITH THEM, HE'S NOT WILLING TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS TO RUSSIA. THIS IS, WITHOUT QUESTION, OUR NUMBER ONE GEO POLITICAL FOE.
Jon: BOO GAFFE. WORDS HURT, MITT ROMNEY. AND I FOR ONE WANT TO TAKE THIS MOMENT TO REASSURE OUR MANY, MANY FOES AROUND THE  WORLD AMERICA DOESN'T PLAY HATE FAVORITES. (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE ALL NUMBER ONE IN YOUR OWN SPECIAL WAY. IRAN, DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU YOU ARE NOT A REAL NUMBER ONE FOE IN OUR HEARTS. NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM CHINA, OUR NUMBER ONE ECONOMIC FOE OR PAKISTAN, OUR NUMBER ONE FOE WITH BENEFITS. NOW THAT'S AN INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT GAFFE. NEXT UP, THE FLASHPOINT SOCIAL ISSUE GAFFE.
CONCERNING THE TRAGIC SHOOTING OF TRAYVON MARTIN BY GEORGE ZIMMERMAN.
THE FLORIDA COUPLE SAYS THEY ARE LIVING IN FEAR AFTER SOMEONE TWEETED THEIR  ADDRESS AS THE HOME OF GEORGE ZIMMERMAN.
Jon: WHAT? WHO WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT ASNINE. HOPEFULLY IT IS ONE OF THESE FRINGE TWITTER CRACK POTS WITH 12 FOLLOWERS AND THE  DAMAGE IS HIT GATED. MATTERS GOT MUCH WORSE WHEN SPIKE LEE REPORTEDLY RETWEETED TO ALL OF HIS FOLLOWERS THAT ADDRESS. HE HAS 250,000 FOLLOWERS. AND NOW SPIKE LEE RETWEETING SOMEBODY HOME ADDRESS WITHOUT VERIFYING WHOSE IT IS.
THAT SAY BAD MISTAKE.
IT CERTAINLY IS.
Jon: YES. SENDING A LYNCH MOB TO THE WRONG ADDRESS IS A BAD MISTAKE. BUT I GOT TO SAY, EVEN IF IT WAS THE RIGHT ADDRESS, THAT'S STILL A BAD [BLEEP] THING. SENDING A LYNCH MOB TO ANYBODY'S ADDRESS IS A BAD MISTAKE. RIGHT ADDRESS, WRONG ADDRESS, LYNCH MOB-- AND SPIKE, YOU'RE A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN, LEAVE THE CYBERBULLYING TO TEENAGERS. YOU KNOW, IT IS AS IMMATURE AS STEALING SALLY JESSE RAFAEL'S GLASS, SERIOUSLY. SERIOUSLY, SPIKE. DID YOU STEAL SALLIE JESSE RAFAEL'S GLASSES? HOW COULD THIS GET ANY WORSE?
MY HUSBAND SAID WE DON'T HAVE A GEORGE THAT LIVES HERE AND DON'T KNOW ANYONE. AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE GOT HATE MAIL.
IT WAS AN ENVELOPE ADDRESSED WITH A BLACK MAGIC MARKER TO GEORGE ZIMMERMAN  IT SAID TASTE THE RAINBOW. AND I GUESS THAT IS THE SKITTLES CATCH-PHRASE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE PEOPLE WHOSE ADDRESS YOU TWEETED ARE THE MOST ADORABLE PEOPLE EVER.
IT'S BEEN REALLY, REALLY HARD, REALLY HARD. I HAVE A HEART CONDITION. AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND THIS IS JUST SKYROCKETED IT.
Jon: OH GOD, OF COURSE YOU DO. I'M SO SORRY FOR YOU GUYS. YOU MOVED TO FLORIDA SO YOU COULD FINALLY RELAX AND ENJOY THESE YEARS AND YOU  SUDDENLY FIND YOURSELF AS LIVE ON THE CORNER OF BULL'S EYE STREET AND ANGRY MOB AVENUE. SPIKE, TELL ME YOU'VE MADE THIS RIGHT.
SPEAK LEE'S TWEET HAS SINCE BEEN REMOVED.
Jon: OH, GOOD. WE ALL KNOW ONCE SOMETHING IS REMOVED FROM TWITTER IT IS GONE FOREVER. (LAUGHTER) LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED. DAMAGE FIXED. COME ON, SPIKE.
SPIKE WROTE ON TWITTER LAST NIGHT I DEEPLY APOLOGISE TO THE McLEAN  FAMILY FOR RETWEETING THEIR ADDRESS IT WAS A MISTAKE. PLEASE LEAVE THE McLEAN'S IN PEACE. JUSTICE IN COURT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S A NIGHT HERS FELT APOLOGY, ALTHOUGH CALL ME CRAZY, SOMETHING TELLS ME A TWEET ISN'T THE IDEAL MEDIUM FOR APOLOGIZING TO 71-YEAR-OLDS.
I NEVER TWEETEDMENT I DON'T EVEN TEXT.
Jon: OF COURSE YOU DON'T. YOU'RE TOO BUSY BAKING COOKIES FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS AND SOWING YOUR  GRANDDAUGHTER A QUILT. YOU'RE ADOREABLE. SERIOUSLY, SPIKE A POLL GIZING TO PEOPLE IN A WAY THEY CAN COMPREHEND. TAPE A NOTE TO THEIR GRANDKIDS. HOLD UP A SIGN AT A KNICKS GAME OR CALL THEM. THAT IS WHAT THEY REALLY WANT. THAT IS ALL ANY FLORIDA RETIREE REALLY WANTS. PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL THEM. AND THEN, HELP THEM MOVE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
