Jon:  HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN, DO WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. MY GUEST, MARTIN SCORSESE. I'M GOING TO GET RIGHT TO. WE BEGIN TONIGHT-- HE'LL BE OUT HERE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE REPUBLICAN RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AND A SURPRISING NEW DEVELOPMENT.
NEWT GINGRICH IS SURGING IN THE POLLS.
MR. GINGRICH AT 32%. ROMNEY 19. CAIN 13.
Jon:  STUNNING. AND NOT JUST BECAUSE GINGRICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD DIPLOMATICALLY REFER TO AS... LIKEABILITY CHALLENGED. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT BECAUSE IN MAY OF THIS YEAR, HIS CAMPAIGN WAS DECLARED DEAD.
IT KEEPS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE FOR NEWT GINGRICH.
IT NEWT FINISHES.
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, JUST IN TWO WORDS.
HE'S DONE.
IT IS NOW FUNCTIONALLY OVER FOR GINGRICH.
Jon:  CAN'T BELIEVE IT. WHEN NEWT GINGRICH WAS ON HIS DEATH BED, THE MEDIA JUST DIVORCED THEMSELVES FROM HIM. WHO DOES SOMETHING LIKE THAT? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THAT'S THE POLITICAL MEDIA. THEY CARE ABOUT TWO THINGS-- ARE YOU ANYTHING TO WIN EAR ARE YOU DEAD?"  BACHMANN GOT A TASTE OF IT BACK IN JULY.
LOOK WHO IS SURGING NOW.
MICHELE BACHMANN ROCKETS UP THE RANKS.
MICHELE BACHMANN.
LET'S FACE IT, MICHELE BACHMANN HAS BEEN SURGING IN EVERY SINGLE POLL.
Jon:  AT THIS PACE, BY THE TIME OF THE ELECTION, SHE'LL BE AT 5,000%. SHE CAN'T GO WRONG. BUT, SADLY, NOT TWO MONTHS LATER.
IS IT OVER FOR MICHELE BACHMANN?
THAT THE END FOR MICHELE BACHMANN?
IT'S PROBABLY CURTAINS FOR HER (  LAUGHTER  ).
Jon:  YES, IT'S AMAZING WHAT PAYING ATTENTION TO A CANDIDATE CAN DO TO THEIR CANDIDACY. WITH THE DEATH OF HER CAMPAIGN, WHO WILL RISE TO COMPLETE THE CIRCLE OF PROLIFE?
TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY, JUMPING INTO THE LEAD AS NEW REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNER.
Jon:  PRESIDENT PERRY! IT IS ON THIS DAY, AUGUST 31, 2011, THAT I INAUGURATE RICK PERRY, THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES.
THIS DOG DON'T HUNT. RICK PERRY IS FINISHED. HE'S OUT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  OH,. PRESIDENT PERRY, WE HARDLY KNEW YE. SO WE STAND ONCE AGAIN ALONE, WITH OUR BOULDER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL. HOPEFULLY, THIS BOULDER DOESN'T HAVE THE "N" WORD ON IT, BUT... ( APPLAUSE ) WHO WILL PUSH IT UP FOR US NOW?
LATEST POLL JUST OUT FROM QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY DESCRIBE  HERMAN CAIN'S RISE TO THE TOP AS "METERRIC."
Jon:  ALL HAIL KING CAIN! WHAT HAPPENS TO MEET WHORS THEY HIT THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE?
IS THIS THE END OF THE ROAD FOR HERK AN CAIN.
STICK A FORK IN THE PIZZA GUY.
Jon:  HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU PEOPLE-- YOU DO NOT EAT PIZZA WITH A ( BLEEP )  FORK ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU FOLD IT, YOU STUFF IT, AND YOU KEEP ONE HAND FREE TO GO GET  THE ( BLEEP ) AWAY. SO THE NAMES OF THE FALLEN SOUND OUT, BACHMANN, PERRY, CAIN. PERHAPS RON PAUL WILL NOW GET HIS SHOT AS THE MEDIA FRONT-RUNNER.
RON PAUL HAS NO CHANCE OF BEING ELECTED. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  HIS POLL NUMBERS ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT, NOT MERCURIAL, AND--
HE'S GOT NO CHANCE.
Jon:  YOU'VE GIVEN EVERYONE ELSE A CHANCE. FORGOD'S SAY, A WOMAN WHO NEVER ENTERED THE RACE, SARAH PALIN, GOT MORE HEAT FROM THE MEDIA.
IF YOU GET VIDEO OF SARAH PALIN, OR GET A SOUNDBITE FROM HER, BRING THAT BACK TO US. YOU CAN HOLD THE RON PAUL STUFF.
Jon:  UHHH... UHHH. THE THOUGHT OF COVERING HIM AMUSES ME. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. I WISH MY-- ( APPLAUSE ) SO THE MEDIA HAS BASICALLY DECLARED ALL FOUR OF THOSE OTHER  CANDIDATES DEAD, YET SOMEHOW THE ZOMBIES CONTINUE TO BE ALLOWED TO THE PODIUM. YOU KNOW WHY THAT FREAKS ME OUT? THESE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE DEAD (  LAUGHTER  )  IT'S LIKE THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IS SOME TYPE OF N. KNIGHT SHAMALAN PICTURE. YOU ARE GETTING BETTER AT CONDENSING THE STORY LINES. BACHMANN AND PERRY GOT TO BATHE IN THE SPOTLIGHT OF BEING THE FRONT-RUNNER LIKE TWO MONTHS EACH. EVEN CAIN GOT A MONTH BEFORE THEY DECLARED HIM DEAD. SO NOW, YESTERDAY, NEWT GINGRICH IS DECLARED YOUR FRONT-RUNNER, WHICH MEANS WE'LL SOON BE FINDING OUT NEW REASONES YES HE SUCKS.
NEWT GINGRICH, HE'S BEING DOGGED BY A REPORT THAT HE EARNED $1.6 MILLION CONSULTING  FOR MORTGAGE GIANT FREDDIE MAC.
Jon:  WHOA! GIVE IT TO THEM STRAIGHT, DOC. HOW LONG'S HE GOT?
HE'S DEAD ON ARRIVAL.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL SURVIEF THIS.
IT IS CORRUPTION.
Jon:  JACK ABRAMOFF JUST CALLED YOU CORRUPT. JACK ABRAMOFF CALLED YOU CORRUPT. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S LIKE THE POPE TELLING YOU, YOU'VE GOT A NICE HOUSE. ( LAUGHTER ) SORRY, NEWT, YOU'RE OUT. PACK YOUR KNIVES AND STAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND
