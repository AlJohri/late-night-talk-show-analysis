Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT WRITES THE CURRENT COLUMN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED INDIA CALLING, THE INTIMATE PORTRAIT OF A NATION'S REMAKING. PLEASE WELCOME HIM TO THE PROGRAM. HELLO, SIR. NICE TO SEE YOU.
GREAT TO BE HERE.
Reporter: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THE BOOK IS CALLED INDIA CALLING. IT'S AMAZING. YOU WERE BORN IN.
CLEVELAND, OHIO.
Reporter: I THOUGHT IT WAS SHAKER HEIGHTS.
A SUBURB OF CLEVELAND.
Reporter: SHAKER HEIGHTS. YOUR PARENTS FIRST GENERATION. YOU DECIDE AT 21 TO GO BACK TO INDIA. TO DO WHAT?
I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, AS A CHILD I HAD GROWN UP HATING INDIA BECAUSE IT WAS THIS KIND  OF STAGNANT, DEAD, STIFLING COUNTRY. SOMETIME WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I REALIZED THAT SOMETHING HAD CHANGED AND I HADN'T KEPT UP  TO DATE WITH IT. THE COUNTRY THEY LEFT WAS MAYBE SOMETHING THAT I NEEDED TO GO AND UNDERSTAND. SO I MOVED BACK RIGHT AFTER I FINISHED COLLEGE.
Reporter: NOW DO YOU FEEL LIKE INDIA HAD CHANGED DRAMATICALLY OR ALSO YOUR  PERCEPTION OF IT OR IS IT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.
THE OVERLAP OF THE TWO. I THINK WHEN YOU'RE A CHILD THE ONLY THING YOU DON'T WANT IS TO BE DIFFERENT FROM PEOPLE. A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS FEEL WITH FIRST GENERATION FAMILIES AND KIDS PUSH THAT AWAY. I PUSHED IT AWAY. IT WAS PARTLY THAT AND WHERE INDIA WAS IN THE WORLD AT THAT STAGE. NO ONE WAS PUTTING IT ON THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINES OR TALKING ABOUT IT AS A GREAT  SUPER POWER, NO ONE WAS GOING TO STATE DINNERS IN WASHINGTON. IT WAS A PLACE THAT FELT TO ME BETTER NOT TO BE FROM. BY THE TIME I WAS IN COLLEGE YOU BECOME MORE SECURE. INDIA HAD CHANGED. IT HAD ACTUALLY CHANGED ON THE GROUND.
Jon: YOUR PARENTS. I'M JUST IMAGINING, OKAY, THIS SON, MY GRANDPARENTS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY. IF I HAD TOLD THEM I WAS GOING BACK TO THE PLACE THAT THEY HAD WORKED SO DAMNED HARD TO  GET OUT OF IT, PASSIVE AGGRESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE MENU. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN, SURE, GO BACK. WHY NOT? I'M FINE. I'M FINE. JUST PUT IT A DAGGER THROUGH MY SKULL. DID YOU RECEIVE ANY PUSH-BACK FROM YOUR PARENTS?
NOT MUCH UNTIL THE DAY MY SISTER WAS WORKING AT GOOGLE AT THE TIME IN CALIFORNIA. AND I WAS ALREADY OUT IN INDIA. SHE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO POTENTIALLY DO THE SAME THING. AND I THINK THAT THE PROSPECT OF A DOUBLE WHAMMIE WAS TOO MUCH. KIND OF REVERSE IMMIGRATION DOUBLE WHAMMIE. YOU I.M.ED ME ONE DAY AND SAID WHAT AM I DOING HERE? IT NEVER REALLY CAME UP AGAIN. SHE WONDERED WITH A ARE WE DOING HERE IF WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING....
Jon: THEY CAME TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. YOU WERE THE EMBODIMENT OF THEIR AMERICAN DREAM. YOU WERE NOW GOING BACK BECAUSE THE AMERICAN DREAM WAS STILL ALIVE. IT WAS JUST ALIVE IN INDIA.
THAT'S THE CONFUSION.
Jon: WHAT DID YOU FIND, YOU KNOW, INDIA'S CASTE SYSTEM SEEMINGLY HAS BEEN THE BULWARK  AGAINST THE TYPE OF UPWARD MOBILITY THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IS THAT GONE NOW?
CASTE WAS THE ONLY THING THAT EVERYBODY SAID ABOUT THEM. IT WAS LIKE RACE IN THIS COUNTRY. IT WAS THE MOST PROFOUND FACT ABOUT THE PLACE. IN A WAY IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE IDEA BEHIND CASTES. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU DO, HOW SMART YOU ARE OR WHO YOU ARE, YOUR FATHER AND GRANDFATHER AND YOU WILL OF  THE POSITIONS ALL THE WAY CONTROL THAT. IF ANYTHING IS CHANGING IN TODAY'S INDIA, IT IS THE LACK OF BELIEF IN THIS IDEA. PEOPLE ARE REJECTING THIS BELIEF. PEOPLE ARE BELIEVING THAT YOU SHOULD GET WHERE YOU ARE BASED ON WHAT YOU DO NOT WHO YOU ARE. THAT IS A PROFOUND REVOLUTION THAT IS HAPPENING ONE INDIAN AT A TIME.
Jon: YOU TALK ABOUT THIS KIND OF REVINDRA. HE IS A CHARACTER SO MOTIVATED, SO INDUSTRIOUS HE'S THE TYPE OF GUY THAT YOU WOULD IMAGINE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE FIRST  PLANE OUT TO AMERICA 20 YEARS AGO. BUT HE'S CHOOSING TO STAY NOW IN INDIA AND USE HIS INDUSTRY THERE. DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?
HE IS THE CLASSIC SELF-MADE MAN. AS YOU SAY HE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY DONE THAT SELF-MAKING IN NEW JERSEY OR CALIFORNIA A  GENERATION AGO. HE WAS BORN IN A VILLAGE IN INDIA. BUMPED UP AGAINST THE LIMITATIONS OF BEING FROM THAT VILLAGE. AND THROUGH AN EXTRAORDINARY RUN OF EFFORT, OF SELF-EDUCATION THROUGH ALL  THESE HOLE IN THE WALL CLASSES PULLED HIMSELF OUT. AT THE END OF THAT JOURNEY NOT ONLY DID HE NOT WANT TO GO TO AMERICA, WHICH HE DIDN'T. HE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO GO THE BIGGEST CITIES IN INDIA. I SAID WHY? HE SAID WHEN COME FROM WHERE I COME FROM THE LOWEST OF THE LOW. IT'S NOT JUST MONEY YOU WANT. YOU WANT DIGNITY AND PEOPLE TO RESPECT YOU AND KNOW YOU AND SAY SIR TO YOU. HE WANTED TO GO FROM THAT VILLAGE TO THE NEAREST TOWN WHERE HE HAD MORE OPPORTUNITY  BUT WHERE HE WAS STILL BIG BY THE STANDARDS OF THE TOWN. HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET LOST IN AMERICA OR EVEN IN THE BIGGER CITIESS OF INDIA.
Jon: AS YOU WATCH THE CHANGE TAKING PLACE IN YOUR MIND COMING FROM SHAKER  HEIGHTS OHIO AND GOING TO INDIA, DO YOU THINK AMERICA CAN STILL KICK THEIR ASS? WHERE WERE YOU AT NOW? ARE WE STILL IN AN ASS-KICK KG
I HAD A DIFFERENT ANSWER FOR COLBERT BUT FOR YOU....
Jon: (LAUGHING).
YOU GET THE REAL DEAL.
Jon: BREAK IT DOWN. LET ME HEAR IT.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS AND WE TALK ABOUT INDIA AND CHINA IN THIS COUNTRY, WE TALK ABOUT  AN ECONOMIC THREAT. WE'RE ALL OBSESSED WITH EMERGING MARKETS, RIGHT? THE SAME THING WITH CHINA. I THINK THE REAL THING AMERICANS SHOULD THINK ABOUT IS THESE COUNTRIES POSE A  CHALLENGE OF CULTURE AND SPIRIT BECAUSE IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE SEGMENT YOU DID ON  THE CULTURE AND DISCOURSE IN THIS COUNTRY, WE ARE ALL PULLING EACH OTHER DOWN. WE'RE CREATING A CULTURE OF DESTRUCTION AND PULLING EACH OTHER DOWN. INDIA AND CHINA, FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT LIES AHEAD FOR THEM, ARE STARTING TO CREATE  CULTURES OF HOPE AND CULTURES OF CREATION WHERE THERE'S A CONSENSUS ON THINGS. HOW DO WE CREATE SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY? WE NEED TO BE WORRIED NOT ABOUT AN ECONOMIC THREAT BUT THE THREAT OF THAT SPIRIT. IN ABOUT 2.5 BILLION PEOPLE.
Jon: MAY I SUM UP THE INTERVIEW?
PLEASE.
Jon: UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL. AND IF I...
