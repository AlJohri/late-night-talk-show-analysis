JUNE 11, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOT A GOOD GUEST TONIGHT. OUR GUEST IS LONDON MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON WHOSE NAME IS -- FUN FACT -- WHAT RUSSIAN MEN CALL  THEIR PENISES. WE BEGIN TONIGHT, MORE SIGNS THAT THIS YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL RACE WILL BE FAR MORE THAN A  MERE POLITICAL CONTEST AS THE MAYANS FORETOLD WE ARE ENTERING ENTERING... (DRAMATIC MUSIC)... TONIGHT ON DEMOCALYPSE 2012 WE EXAMINE THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE CANDIDATE GAFFE. IN THE OLD DAYS THE SINGLE GAFFE COULD LIVE FOR MONTHS, YEARS. BUT THERE WAS AN UNFORTUNATE PHOTO OP, AN ILL ADVISED TURN OF PHRASE.
READ MY LIPS. NO NEW TAXES.
Jon: OR EVEN BEING A DECORATED VIETNAM VETERAN. OH, GAFFE. BUT IN TODAY'S MODERN WORLD, AN EXPLODING GAFFE POPULATION FORCES EACH INDIVIDUAL GAFFE TO  FIGHT DESPERATELY FOR DWINDLING RESOURCES.  ♪ AND I BELIEVE I HEAR A GAFFE BEING BORN RIGHT NOW. JOIN ME AS WE WATCH PRESIDENT OBAMA DESCRIBE HOW JOB GROWTH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS MATCHED BY  JOB LOSSES IN THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT
THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS DOING FINE.
Jon: GAFFE. CONNATE GRAT LAYINGSES, MR. PRESIDENT. IT'S A GAFFE. AND WITHIN MINUTES THE GAFFE IS BEING NURTURED AND FED IN THE HOPES THAT ONE DAY IT BECOMES A  MATURE TALKING POINT
ARE YOU KIDDING? DID HE SEE THE JOB NUMBERS THAT CAME OUT LAST WEEK? THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS NOT DOING FINE.
IS HE REALLY THAT OUT OF TOUCH?
THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS DOING FINE.
Jon: WOW. IT HAD ALREADY GROWN INTO A FULL-FLEDGED POLITICAL ATTACK AD. SEEMS LIKE ANY YESTERDAY IT WAS JUST A GAFFE. BUT THE TRUTH IS IT WASN'T EVEN YESTERDAY. IT WAS JUST TWO-AND-A-HALF  [BLEEP] HOURS AGO. OF COURSE AS SURELY AS WINTER FOLLOWS A FALL A FULL-GROWN GAFFE MUST SOME DAY BE WALKED BACK. FOR THIS GAFFE, THAT DAY WAS THE ACTUAL SAME DAY, FOUR HOURS LATER.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOT DOING FINE. THAT'S THE REASON I HAD THE PRESS CONFERENCE. THAT'S WHY I SPENT YESTERDAY, THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, THIS PAST WEEK, THIS PAST MONTH AND THIS PAST YEAR TALKING ABOUT HOW  WE CAN MAKE THE ECONOMY STRONGER. THE ECONOMY IS NOT DOING FINE.
Jon: GAFFE OVER, RIGHT? OKAY. I MEAN, ANYBODY WANT TO ASK ME IF I'M KENYAN? I MEAN, ANYBODY. GOT SOMETHING ELSE? I HAVE REV. WRIGHT HERE. HE'LL COME OUT AND ASK QUESTIONS. CAN WE MOVE ON IS WHAT I'M SAYING? ALL THAT REMAINS IS THE BLOODY GAFFE CARCASS TO BE PICKED OVER  BY OUR NATION'S MOST HE'S TEEMED GAFFE-STRONOMISTS WHO WILL MEASURE THE GAFFE USING THE  EXACT SCIENCE OF GAFFE-TRONOMY
I THINK IT WILL LAST LONGER THAN, SAY, MITT ROMNEY'S ETCH A SKETCH MOMENT
IN TERMS OF STAYING POWER, EXPECT OTHER GAFFES TO COME DOWN
ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10, 10 BEING POLITICAL ANNIHILATION, HOW BIG A BLUNDER WAS THERE?
SIX. Jon: SO, IF 10 IS POLITICAL ANNIHILATION, SIX WOULD BE A POLITICAL HAVING YOUR FACE  BITTEN OFF BY A CHIMP? IS THAT GAFFE THAT IS SET ABLAZE AND PUSHED INTO A FYORDS, ANOTHER GAFFE CONCEIVED DURING THE SPEECH ATTACKING OBAMA'S ORIGINAL GAFFE IS BORN.
HE SAYS WE NEED MORE FIREMEN, MORE POLICEMEN, MORE TEACHERS. DID HE NOT GET THE MESSAGE IN WISCONSIN?
MITT ROMNEY ANSWERED IT WITH A GAFFE OF HIS OWN. WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE TEACHERS? WHAT PLANET IS HE LIVING ON?
WE NEED MORE FIREMEN, MORE POLICEMEN, MORE TEACHERS.
LOOK, IN THE GAFFE DERBY HERE, MITT ROMNEY IS WAY AHEAD
IT'S TIME FOR US TO CUT BACK ON GOVERNMENT AND HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: SIMPLY BREATH TAKING. NOW, OF COURSE, SOMETIMES A GAFFE CAN CONSIST NOT OF WHAT YOU SAID OR DID BUT WHAT YOU DID NOT DO. CASE IN POINT. LAST WEEK THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN RELEASED A TWO-AND-A-HALF MINUTE INTERNET AD SHOWED MITT ROMNEY  GREETING SUPPORTERS ALL ACROSS AMERICA
TO ALL OF THE THOUSANDS OF GOOD AND DECENT AMERICANS I'VE  MET WHO WANT NOTHING MORE THAN A BETTER CHANCE, A FIGHTING CHANCE, HOLD ON A LITTLE LONGER. A BETTER AMERICA BEGINS TONIGHT.
Jon: WITH A HUG. LOOK AT ROMNEY. HE CRAVES HUMAN CONTACT. HE'S A PEOPLE-SOMETHING. BUT CRITICS ARE CONCERNED THAT THE AD FALLS SHORT IN ONE REGARD.
IT'S GOT THE AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN. IT'S GOT ALL OF THAT. ONE THING THAT IT'S BEING CRITICIZED FOR IS ITS LACK OF DIVERSITY
IT'S HE'S NOT RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES. MAYBE HE'S RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF CAUCASIAN-STAN OR SOME PLACE THAT DOESN'T HAVE  ANYONE OF COLOR IN IT
Jon: A FUN FACT ABOUT CAUCASIAN-STAN ITS TOP EXPORTS INCLUDE GOLF SHOES AND JOSH GROBAN. FOR MORE WE TURN TO SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE. LARRY? (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: LARRY, WE SAW IN THIS AD, THIS AD IS THREE MINUTES LONG. THREE MINUTES LONG. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE BLACK PERSON IN THIS AD.
NO, NO, NO. NOT TRUE, JON. IF YOU GO TO THE TAPE YOU'LL SEE A BROTHER RIGHT HERE. BACK IT UP. BACK IT UP. FORWARD, FORWARD, FORWARD. RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE. 15 FRAMES OF THE BACK OF A BLACK GUY'S HEAD. MOST LIKELY BLACK. POSSIBLY INDIAN. COULD BE MY PERSIAN FRIEND PARTHA. DEFINITELY NOT WHITE
Jon: THAT'S A BIG OVERSIGHT THIS HAS TO BE DELIBERATE. DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO COMPILE THREE MINUTES OF FOOTAGE SHOT IN AMERICA AND NOT HAVE ANY  MINORITY END UP ON CAMERA. THAT TAKES A LOT OF SKILL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SHOT OF ROMNEY AT A RESTAURANT. YOU MOVE THAT CAMERA JUST TO THE LEFT YOU'LL CATCH AT LEAST ONE BROTHER IN A HAIR NET. HOW ABOUT THE SCENE WITH ROMNEY IN THE OFFICE? YOU CAN'T TELL ME THERE'S NO MEXICANS JUST OFF CAMERA EMPTYING THE WASTE BIN. CUT. JOSE, GET OUT OF THE SHOT.
Jon: A MEXICAN COULD BE RUNNING THAT BUSINESS
IF HE'S A WASTE-BIN-EMPTYING BUSINESS, THAT MAKES SENSE
Jon: DON'T THINK ADDING A FEW BLACK FACES COULD HELP ROMNEY WITH THE BLACK VOTE?
I GUESS IT COULD HELP HIM WITH THE BLACK VOTE IN THE SAME WAY JUMPING GETS YOU CLOSER TO  THE SUN. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NO, NO, NO, JON. NO. THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT THE BLACK VOTE. IT'S ABOUT THE WHITE VOTE.
Jon: IS THAT A THING? IS THE WHITE VOTE A THING?
ABSOLUTELY, JON. BACK IN 2008 OBAMA MADE A SERIOUS PLAY FOR IT. HE WENT BOWLING, PUT ON HIS MOM JEANS, THREW HIS BLACK PREACHER UNDER THE BUS.
Jon: HE DID THE HOPE AND CHANGE THING
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU WHITE GUYS LOVE THAT STUFF.
Jon: VERY NICE TRUE IT'S NICE WHICH IS WHY HE WON WITH 43% OF THE WHITE VOTE. BUT SINCE THEN, HE'S INVITING RAPPERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, WIFE'S GROWING COLLARD GREENS ON THE GARDEN. GETTING ANGRY ABOUT THE ONE PERCENT AND PAYING YOUR FAIR SHARE. AND THIS.  ♪ (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FIRST IT'S... PERFECT PITCH. WHITE VOTERS ARE LOOKING AROUND THINKING WAS HE ALWAYS THIS BLACK? IT ALL ADDS UP TO WHITE FLIGHT, JON
Jon: WHITE FLIGHT? SO ROMNEY IS POSITIONING HIS CANDIDACY AS?
THE SUBURBS. THAT'S RIGHT, JON. IT'S A NICE SAFE ENCLAVE WHERE WHITE PEOPLE CAN HIKE UP THEIR PANTS AND BASKETBALL COURTS  STILL HAVE NETS AND PEOPLE CAN SAY [BLEEP] LIKE THIS.
WHAT'S SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE IS SAUCE FOR THE GANDER.
AND OTHER PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. NOW THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE WHITE VOTE. WELL DONE, MITT ROMNEY. MEANWHILE, OBAMA IS STILL OUT THERE POSING WITH BLACK PEOPLE. GOD, WE GET IT. YOU'RE DOWN.
Jon: I THINK THAT'S HIS FAMILY.
RIGHT, JON. WE'RE ALL RELATED, RIGHT. LOOK. THE POINT IS YOU'RE NOT LOSING THE BLACK VOTE UNLESS YOU DO SOMETHING CRAZY LIKE SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE. WHAT? HE...
Jon: NOTHING. LARRY WILMORE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT
