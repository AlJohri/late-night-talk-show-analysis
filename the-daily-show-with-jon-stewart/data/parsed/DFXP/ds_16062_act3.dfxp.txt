(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK WITH MY GUEST TONIGHT, VERY FUNNY GUY, WE FOUND HIM ON THE INTERNET AND HE JUST SEEMS TERRIFIC. HE'S GOT A NEW MOVIE OUT CALLED "EVERYTHING MUST GO."
HAY, BRO, I'LL GIVE YOU TEN BUCKS FOR THAT RIGHT THERE.
AREN'T YOU YOUNG TO BE DRINKING BEERS.
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE OLD TO BE DRIPPING THAT SLIPPERY THERE, GRAY BALL?
IS THAT WHAT THEY TEACH YOU IN SCHOOL YOU LITTLE (BLEEP)?
WHAT? (HORN HONKING) (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW WILL FERRELL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I PLAYED A LOT OF BALL IN MY TIME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT THIS REMINDS ME OF? THIS STORY MAY BE APOCRYPHAL.
RIGHT.
Jon: BUT THEY SAY THAT BABE RUTH ONCE...
RIGHT.
Jon: CALLED A SHOT.
NEVER HEARD OF HIM. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: HE TOOK THE BAT AND HE SAID "I'M GOING TO (BLEEP) THAT GUY."
THAT'S RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) AND HE DID THAT AND POINTED TO THE STANDS.
TO THAT THICK CHILD. (LAUGHTER) IN THAT HOSPITAL ROOM. (LAUGHTER) IN CHICAGO OR WHEREVER YOU ARE.
Jon: (LAUGHS).
I'M GOING TO (BLEEP) THAT GUY. (LAUGHTER) YES.
Jon: TODAY... TODAY... TODAY.
...TODAY... TODAY.
Jon:
I'M THE LUCKIEST MAN.
Jon: LUCKIEST MAN. I'M GOING TO (BLEEP) THAT GUY... GUY... GUY...
I DO NOT BET ON BASEBALL.
Jon: NO.
BUT... (LAUGHTER).
Jon: THIS IS TRUE. WILL DID NOT KNOW WE WERE DOING THAT BIT TONIGHT AND JUST HAPPENED TO BRING THE BAT.
JUST HAPPENED TO BRING THE BAT. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE WALKING THROUGH THE STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? HOW DID YOU GO... N A THREE-MINUTE SPAN?
I ASKED YOUR OUTSTANDING STAFF GOD IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I COULD JUST WALK OUT WITH A BAT. BOOM! (LAUGHTER) WHERE'S THE BAT? WHERE'S THE BAT? WELL YOU HAVE,...
Jon: YOU HAVE SUFFICIENTLY RUINED THAT FOR OUR INTRAMURAL SOFTBALL GAME. (LAUGHTER).
ANYONE GOING UP TO THE PLATE HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT MOTION NOW. THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY WAY.
Jon: WOULDN'T THAT MAKE GAMES SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING.
AND THAT WILL DRIVE THE OTHER TEAM CRAZY! EITHER SEXUALLY OR IT WILL JUST MESS THEM UP IN SUCH A WAY THAT...
Jon: JUST IN BETWEEN PITCHES TO JUST STEP OUT AND STARE AT THE PITCHER AND JUST GO  "OH, YEAH." (LAUGHTER)
NOT GUN THAT HAPPEN TODAY, GUYS. CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING MORE INTIMIDATING?
Jon: PROBABLY. BUT... THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF THAT'S MORE INTIMIDATING IS IF YOU STEP OUT  OF THE BATTER'S BOX.
RIGHT.
TAKE THE BAT, PUT IN THE YOUR HANDS AND DO THAT THE WHOLE TIME  TWO CREEPY LITTLE GIRLS JUST STARING RIGHT THERE (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW? LIKE THE KIDS IN "THE SHINING."
Jon: THEY DON'T LOOK FORWARD. THEY JUST LOOK AT YOU. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: CHUCK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THIS LINED UP. THE BEST PART ABOUT THAT WHOLE THING...
THEY DON'T BLINK.
Jon: THEY'VE CLEARLY BEEN COACHED BUT THE LITTLE GIRL JUST  TO THE... SHE'S ON THE LEFT OF THE SCREEN. WHEN GLORIA ALLRED DOES HER, YOU KNOW, "TOOK THE BAT AND PUT IT IN HIS... WORDS FOR MAN'S BOTTOM. " LOOK AT THIS. BUT THE LITTLE GIRL GIGGLES. THE LITTLE GIRL WHEN THEY DO IT EARLIER ON, THE LITTLE GIRL  COULDN'T HELP AS SHE'S LOOKING AT IT WHEN GLORIA ALLRED SAYS  "IN THE BUTT" DID ONE OF THESE. (LAUGHTER) LIKE, I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TO BE COOL BUT THAT'S HILARIOUS. (LAUGHTER)
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS GONNA SAY THAT. YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: IN WHAT WORLD...
I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: AND IF SHE'S YOUR LAWYER, IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A "SIMPSONS."  LIKE LIONEL HUT.
THAT'S A FANTASTIC PIECE OF FOOTAGE.
Jon: ISN'T IT NICE?
BUT SHE'S THE BEST, ALLRED.
Jon: WE NEED TO PUT THAT TO SOME BASE MUSIC. LIKE SOME (HUMMING PORN MUSIC) (LAUGHTER) SO YOU'RE IN A NEW MOVIE ABOUT A  BASEBALL PLAYER WHO WHO GETS... (LAUGHTER). WHO... GOES OFF ON SOME FANS?
ON SOME FANS.
Jon: WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME, "PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN THREE..."
MEETS THOR IN A BACK ALLEY AND THINGS GET HARD. (LAUGHTER) THEY GET IT ON! IT GOES OFF!
Jon: IT GOES OFF. "EVERYTHING MUST GO" IS WHAT IT'S CALLED.
IT'S A REAL MOVIE, BY THE WAY.
Jon: I APOLOGIZE. IT IS A REAL MOVIE AND HE'S GREAT IN IT AND IT'S REALLY CLEVER AND SMART AND GREAT AND  THE WHOLE BAT (BLEEP) THING DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE. (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. WILL FERRELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
