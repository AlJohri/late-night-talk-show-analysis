CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT ONE TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT AMBASSADOR IVO DAALDER WHICH I'M ASSUMING IS JUST ANOTHER SASHA BARON COHEN  CHARACTER SO. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT -- ACTUALLY THE AMBASSADOR TO NATO. MAYBE HE WILL BOMB US. [ LAUGHTER ] TONIGHT WE BEGIN SOME PLACE VERY SPECIAL. [ LAUGHTER ] SUBMITTED FOR YOUR APPROVAL A SMALL TOWN NEAR VIRGINIA MARYLAND BORDER. MEET JOE A SIMPLE FELLOW WHO SPEAKS FROM HIS HEART. HIS HONESTY IS ABOUT TO TRAP HIM IN A TERIBLE PLACE A PLACE WHERE STRAIGHTFORWARD SENTIMENT IS  THREE DAYS OF (BLEEP). A PLACE WE CALL WASHINGTON, D.C. [ LAUGHTER ] [TWILIGHT ZONE MUSIC PLAYING] [ LAUGHTER ] I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH LIKE ZONE OR VORTEX WOULD HAVE MADE MORE SENSE. ANYWAY, LAST SUNDAY VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN MADE AN APPEARANCE ON "MEET THE PRESS"  AND WAS ASKED ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE.
I AM ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE WITH THE FACT THAT MEN MARRYING MEN, WOMEN MARRYING WOMEN AND  HETEROSEXUAL MEN AND WOMEN ARE ENTITLED TO THE SAME EXACT RIGHTS, ALL THE CIVIL RIGHTS, ALL THE CIVIL LIBERTIES.
Jon: A MOMENT OF CANDOR STRAIGHTFORWARD AND CONCISE FROM JOE BIDEN TSMS NICE TO SEE HIM  SO HONEST SPSHLY HOW MYSTERIOUS HE IS ABOUT THAT TEARDROP TATTOO. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M JUST SAYING YOU DON'T SNITCH IN DE. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. NO. [ LAUGHTER ] SO JOE BIDEN VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY PROGAY MARRIAGE. HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT?
I TAKE A LOOK AT WHEN THINGS REALLY BEGAN TO CHANGE WHEN THE SOCIAL CULTURE CHANGES. I THINK WILL AND GRACE PROBABLY DID MORE TO EDUCATE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAN ALMOST ANYTHING  ANYONE HAS EVER DONE SO FAR. ♪ FICTITIOUS GAYS FICTITIOUS GAYS EVERYBODY LOVES FICTITIOUS GAYS ♪
Jon: HERE IS MY IMPRESSION OF ELLEN DEGENERES DURING THAT COMMENT. I ALWAYS CUT MYSELF --  [ LAUGHTER ] AHHH. JOE BIDE MONEY IN A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS SAYS WHAT HE REALLY FEELS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF GAY MARRIAGE. I ASSUME HE RECOGNIZED THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. IMMEDIATELY.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PROGRAM AIR BIDEN'S OFFICE SAID  HE WAS SPEAKING HIM R FOR HIMSELF AND NOT MAKING NEW POLICY.
Jon: IT'S THE OLD MOM ROUTINE. IF IT WERE UP TO ME, HONEY, I WOULD LET YOU GO TO THE PARTY. I WOULD BUY YOU A SIX PACK TO SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS BUT YOU KNOW HOW YOUR FATHER IS. OBVIOUSLY BIDE SEASON SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF AND NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
DAVID AXELROD TWEETED THIS "WHAT VP SAID THAT ALL MARRIED  COUPLES SHOULD HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME LEGAL RIGHTS IS PRECISELY THE POSITION."
Jon: HASH TAG BIEBER JUST A REFRESM. HE SAID IT'S THE POSITION BECAUSE VP SAID HASH TAG GAY MARRIAGE GOOD LOL. IT'S PROBABLY NOT AS SIMPLE AS VP AND POTUS HAVE SAME POSITION. JAY CARNEY.
LET ME BE CLEAR. THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID WHAT THE SAID ABOUT THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS WITH CITIZENS IS  CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION ON THIS ISSUE. THE PRESIDENT HAS SPOKEN ABOUT THIS. THE PRESIDENT IS THE RIGHT PERSON TO DESCRIBE HIS OWN PERSONAL VIEWS. HE, AS YOU KNOW SAID HIS VIEWS ON THIS WERE EVOLVING.
Jon: AH. [ LAUGHTER ] SO WITH REGARDS TO GAY MARRIAGE THE VICE PRESIDENT'S NEW POSITION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE  PRESIDENT'S POSITION WHICH HAS NOT CHANGED AND IS ALSO CHANGING. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S NOT A SOCIAL POLICY THAT'S A ZEN CONE. MR. CARNEY --
IT IS AS IT WAS, YES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IT IS AS IT WAS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WHAT MASTER IS THE SOUND OF ONE MAN SWEATING? AND WHY ARE THEY SWEATING PHYSICAL SO HARD.
SO SENSITIVE TO BIDEN DOING THIS BECAUSE NUMBER ONE GAY MONEY IN THIS ELECTION HAS  REPLACED WALL STREET MONEY.
Jon: YOU KNOW THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GAY MONEY AND WALL STREET MONEY IS WHEN YOU  PUT GAY MONEY IN ONE OF THEM TACKY DEVELOP CROW WALLETS, IT ROLLS ITS EYES. FOR MORE JOINED BY JOHN OLIVER AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT SAYS HIS VIEWS EVOLVING. HE IS 50 YEARS OLD. WHAT IS HE WAITING FOR? WILL AND GRACE NOT ABLE TO WORK THEIR MAGIC ON THE PRESIDENT?
DON'T BE SO GLIB. YOU AND I BOTH KNOW VIEWS ON THESE ISSUES COULD BE DEEPLY ROOT AND PERSONAL. IT'S UP TO EACH AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHICH SITCOM WILL INFORM THEIR WORLD VIEW.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
JOIN WILL AND GRACE HERE. PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS LESS CONCERNED ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE AND MORE CONCERNED ABOUT RAYMOND AND  HOW MANY PEOPLE LOVED HIM. HOW EXHAUSTING THAT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR RAYMOND.
Jon: IT WAS EXHAUSTING.
IT WAS.
Jon: HAS THE PRESIDENT SEEN MODERN FAMILY?
HE HAS, JON. I'M NOT SAYING HE IS ALL THE WAY THERE BUT HE HAS TO ADMIT CAM AND MITCH ISRAEL MEANT TO BE.
Jon: UNDENIABLE CHEMISTRY.
THEY ARE BOTH GREAT PARENTS.
Jon: IT'S THE WRITING.
IT IS.
Jon: BUT THE POINT IS THIS, IS THE PRESIDENT'S ENTIRE VIEW OF GAY MARRIAGE SHAPED BY TELEVISION?
NO, NO JON, OF COURSE. IF THAT WERE TRUE HE WOULD BE A HUGE FAN OF GAY MARRIAGE. LET'S FACE IT TV HAS NEVER BEEN GAYER. SMASH, GLEE AND THAT SPORT WHERE GUYS ROLL AROUND AND PUNCH EACH OTHER IN THE --
Jon: I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT ONE IS CONSIDERED GAY.
WHAT? WHAT IS NOT GAY ABOUT THAT JON? I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE GAYEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ANCIENT GREEK GAY.
Jon: FINE.
I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE ABOUT THIS IT'S A FACT! JONCHES ACCORD ACCORDING TO YOUR REPORTING WE'RE A LONG WAY FOR THE PRESIDENT SUPPORTING GAY MARRIAGE.
FOR THE TIME BEING BUT LET'S FACE IT. EVOLUTION SUN KNOWABLE. LOOK HOW FAR HE HAS COME ON THIS ISSUE.
THE THE WINDY CITY TIMES POSTED THE COPY OF A 1996 QUESTIONNAIRE ON ITS WEB SITE  FILLED OUT AND SIGNED BY MR. OBAMA RUNNING FOR THE ILLINOIS STATE SENATE. HE WROTE I FAVOR LEGALIZING SAME-SEX MARRIAGES AND WOULD FIGHT EFFORTS TO PROHIBIT SUCH MARRIAGES.
Jon: WOW. I MEAN THAT'S FULL ON SUPPORT. HE SUPPORTED IT BACK THEN.
ABSOLUTELY UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORTED IT, JON. THEN HE EVOLVED.
Jon: INTO WHAT?
A CANDIDATE, JON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I GET IT. THANK YOU, JOHN.
