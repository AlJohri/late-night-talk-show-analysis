Jon: I LOVE THAT DECADE. CATHERINE ZETA-JONES. HELLO!
HI THERE GOOD EVENING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: .
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE ON YOUR SHOW.
Jon: WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU ON THIS PROGRAM.
I'M A BIG FAN, MY FIRST TIME.
Jon: DELIGHTED. YOU ARE THE THROWBACK, THE TRIPLE THREAT, THE SINGING, THE DANCING, THAT'S YOU RIGHT, THAT IS YOU SINGING.
YEAH, THAT'S ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT'S THE SINGING, THAT'S THE DANCING, THE WHOLE BUSINESS.
WELL, YEAH. INTERESTING TO SING THAT PAT BEN A TAR SONG. MY CHARACTER IS REALLY TIGHT ASSED, TIGHTLY COILED UP SO THERE I AM IN THAT SUIT IN A  CHURCH SINGING THAT SONG AM BUT I MUST SAY, AFTER CHICAGO, A WHOLE BUNCH OF OFFERS CAME FOR ANOTHER MUSICAL. AND I WENT TO BROADWAY AND THEN THIS ONE CAME UP AND IT JUST LOOKED LIKE A LOT OF FUN. ALL OF US WITH A LITTLE TONGUE-IN-CHEEK.
Jon: IT LOOKS LIKE-- YOU'RE HAVING A BALL.
IT WAS FUN TO SHOOT. AND IT'S FUN TO WATCH. IT'S FUN FOR ME TO SIT IN THE AUDIENCE AND WATCH TOM CRUISE BEING A ROCKER AND HAVING FUN. AND ALEC BALDWIN AND RUSSELL BRAND.
Jon: THAT GUY CRUISE, I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS ANYTHING HE CAN'T DO  PERFORMANCEWISE, LIKE HE TRANSFORMS IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. HE'S ONE OF THOSE GUYS.
HE'S SOLID, HE'S SOILED. HE THROWS HIMSELF INTO A ROLE, WHATEVER IT IS, AND IS THIS ONE, HE WAS RIPPED, MAN.
Jon: HE WAS. AND HE'S 80 NOW.
HE IS 100 AND-- LIKE 104 OR SOMETHING.
Jon: EXACTLY.
HE'S RIPPED.
Jon: AND HE'S STILL OUT THERE DOING IT.
I KNOW, I'M LOVING IT. HE THREW HIMSELF IN.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN-- SO A STAGE PERFORMER WHO UNDERSTANDS THOSE TYPES OF  MUSICALS IN THE THEATRE, YOU'RE FEEDING OFF THE AUDIENCE. FOR THIS TYPE OF PERFORMANCE, THOUGH, YOU HAVE TEAMSTERS LIKE HEY, NICE DANCE. LIKE WHAT IS-- WHAT IS THE ENERGY THAT YOU ARE FEEDING ON THAT YOU ARE TAKING IN. HOW DOES THAT OPERATE.
IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING. IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROCESS BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE APPLAUSE. YOU KNOW, WHEN ARE YOU IN THEATRE, IF YOU CAN GET NICE NIGHTS YOU FEEL THE AUDIENCE, AND YOU GO BELT OUT A SONG OR NUMBER. WHEN ARE YOU DOING IT IN A STUDIO SITUATION, YOU DO LOOK FOR THE GRIPS TO GO  GREAT JOB, CAT, LIKE ANYBODY GIVE ME A SMILE OR A CLAP, I MEAN IT IS 2:00 IN THE  MORNING AND I'M STILL DOING, HIT ME WITH YOUR BEST SHOT ♪ ♪ SO YOU DON'T GET THAT  ADRENALINE RUSH THAT YOU GET IN THEATRE. BUT YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A DAY ON CELL YOU LIED-- CELL YOU LLOYD FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. I STARTED IN MUTS CALL THEATRE WHEN I WAS 9 YEARS OLD IN BRITAIN.
Jon: AT 9.
YES, I --.
Jon: WHEN DID YOU KNOW, AT WHAT POINT DID YOU RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR ABILITY AS A PERFORMER EXCEEDED THE  OTHER NINE-YEAR-OLDS WHO AT THAT TIME I AM ASSUMING WERE STILL DEALING WITH OBVIOUSLY  ITS COOTIES OUTBREAK OF 1982, BUT THAT IS A-- DID YOU RECOGNIZE IT, DID OTHER PEOPLE RECOGNIZE IT, WHERE DID IT COME FROM.
I CAN NEVER REMEMBER NOT WANTING TO PERFORM AND BE ON STAGE. I HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT TV BECAUSE I DID TV IN BRITAIN BEFORE I CAME TO  STATES TO DO FILM THAT HADN'T CROSSED MY MIND. BUT IT WAS BEING ON THE STAGE. AND IT WASN'T EVEN TO BE FAMOUS. IT WAS JUST, I DON'T KNOW, PEOPLE ASK ME IF MY MOTHER WAS LIKE THE STAGE MOM, THOSE HORRIFYING MOTHERS YOU SEE ON THAT TV SHOW, STAGE MOM. AND THANK GOD SHE WASN'T. AND IT WAS, THEM TRYING TO STOP ME IF ANYTHING. I LEFT SCHOOL AT 15 AND MY TEACHER, MY HEAD MASTER IN MY SCHOOL TOLD MY PARENTS I  WAS NEVER GOING TO BE A BRAIN SURGEON.
Jon: OH, THE LADY SCHOOL FOR BRAIN SURGERY YOU WENT TO.
YEAH. I AM NEVER SAID I WANTED TO BE A BRAIN SURGEON BUT THANKS A LOT FOR INSULTING MY INTELLIGENCE. I'LL GO AND BE A SHOW GIRL.
Jon: I FIND THAT A LOT OF TIMES IN EDUCATION, I WAS TOLD IN HIGH SCHOOL, THEY  DIDN'T EVEN SET THE BAR TO BRAIN SURGERY. THERE THING WAS I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE HOLDING DOWN A JOB. (LAUGHTER)
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS-- BUT DON'T YOU FIND THAT THAT IS FUEL, THAT THERE IS A  CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THAT NEGATIVITY, THAT CAN DRIVE YOU FORWARD.
YEAH, AND BEING IN THE EQUIVALENT OF A SMALL TOWN GIRL, GOING TO LONDON WAS A  BIG THING FOR ME AND TRYING TO MAKE IT. AND IT WAS A DREAM COME TRUE. AND THEN TELEVISION AND YOU KNOW, MOVIES CAME UP. I'VE-- AND I HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING ELSE.
Jon: NOW LOOK AT YOU.
I'M ON YOUR SHOW.
Jon: THE PINNACLE, REALLY, IT'S VERY EXCITING. SO HERE'S THE THING THAT IS AMAZING. SO LIKE YOU'RE IN THIS, YOU ARE MARRIED TO MICHAEL DOUGLAS, YOUR FATHER IS  CIRCUMSTANCE DOUG LABS, EVERYBODY HAS IN LAW PROBLEMS BUT DUDE, YOU'RE UP AGAINST SPARTCUS WA, DO YOU DO.
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S REALLY HARD TO HAVE MY FATHER-IN-LAW BE IN SPARTA CUSS. PGA BEING MICHAEL GROWING UP, HAVING YOUR FATHER AS SPARTA CUSS. WHO IS YOUR DAD, SPARTA CUSS.
Jon: WHY CAN'T I STAY UP HATE.
BECAUSE MI SPARTACUS.
Jon: WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU, CON LAT-- CONGRATULATIONS ON THE SHOW. ROCK OF AGES IN THE THEATRE TOMORROW.
