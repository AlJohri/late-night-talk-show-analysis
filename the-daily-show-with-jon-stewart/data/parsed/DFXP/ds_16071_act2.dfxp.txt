Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE, PEOPLE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: PEOPLE, PEOPLE IN THE HEARTLAND OF OUR COUNTRY, THE MIDWEST RECENTLY HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY. WHETHER IT BE FROM THE FLOODING OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER OR THESE DEADLY TORNADOES. THAT IS WHY THIS RECENT STATEMENT FROM HOUSE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR MUST HAVE BEEN  OF GREAT COMFORT TO THEM.
ERIC CANTOR THE MAJORITY LEADER OF THE HOUSE SAYS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD  PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE PEOPLE IN MISSOURI.
Jon: WHOZA, HERE, HERE, FOR WHAT ARE WE AS A NATION IF WE CANNOT WITHOUT HESITATION EXTEND A HAND TO  OUR FELLOW CITIZENS IN THEIR TIME OF NEED, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. TO HELP EASE THEIR PAIN.
BUT HE WANTS THERE TO BE CUTS IN OTHER FEDERAL SPENDING IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY  PROVIDING THIS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE PEOPLE IN MISSOURI.
Jon: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR  [BLEEP] MIND? (LAUGHTER) JUSTIFY IT. YOU KNOW, REPUBLICANS ARE ALWAYS SO WORRIED ABOUT SOCIALISM, PERMANENTLY TRANSFORMING AMERICA BUT  WHAT IS A MORE FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION OF AMERICA WHERE IF YOUR TOWN IS TAKEN  BY A TORNADO, WE CAN ONLY HELP IF YOU WE MAKE THE NUMBERS WORK. I MEAN SERIOUSLY. RIGHT NOW, ELEPHANTS FROM A MISSOURI KIR SUS-- CIRCUS ARE HELPING CLEAR HEAVY  DEBRIS FROM A TORNADO WHICH MEANS WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING JOPLIN MISSOURI  RESIDENTS ACTUAL ELEPHANTS ARE MORE USEFUL TO THEM THAN THE GOP. THAT'S--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHAT? WHAT, WHAT, WHAT IS CANTOR THINKING? HARRY SMITH SAT DOWN WITH HIM AT THE FACE THE NATIONS CHILDREN'S TABLE TO FIND OUT.
IT IS LIKE THIS, IF WHEN A FAMILY IS STRUCK WITH TRAGEDY LIKE THE FAMILY OF  JOPLIN, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE, LET'S SAY IF THEY HAD $10,000 SET ASIDE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH, TO BUY  A NEW CAR TO DO SOMETHING ELSE, AND THEN THEY WERE STRUCK WITH A SICK MEMBER OF  THE FAMILY OR SOMETHING, AND NEEDED TO TAKE THAT MONEY TO APPLY IT TO THAT, THAT'S  WHAT THEY WOULD DO. BECAUSE FAMILIES DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED MONEY. AND REALLY, NEITHER DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
Jon: ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT IS THE SOUND BITE, GOOD COMMON SENSE UNTIL YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOR TWO SECONDS. AND THEN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE BULL [BLEEP] MASSACRE AIDING AS COMMON SENSE. BUT ALL RIGHT, I'LL ALLOW IT. LET'S THINK ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AS A FAMILY. IT'S JUST LIKE A FAMILY. SO HERE'S OUR COUNTRY. LET'S SAY OUR COUNTRY'S HOUSE IS HIT BY A TORNADO. WOW, WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY BUT DAD, YOU'VE BEEN  UNEMPLOYED FOR FIVE MONTHS AND POLL YOUR TWO JOBS HAVEN'T GOTTEN US MUCH NEST  EGG AND THOSE THREE FREELOADERS IN FRONT OF YOU AREN'T REALLY CHIPPING IN. EXPECTING YOU TO DO EVERYTHING AND REDISTRIBUTE THE WEALTH TO THEM. SOCIALISTS! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WE'RE SCREWED, THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN-- GRANDMA. CANTOR VOTED HOR RYAN'S MEDICARE CHANGE. SO RATHER THAN PAYING FOR ALL OF GRANDMA'S MEDICINE AND FOOD, WE'LL JUST KICK IN  A LITTLE BIT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, AND YOU KNOW, SHE'LL MAKE IT WORK. (LAUGHTER)
SOME WAYS WE ARE DOING HER A FAVOR. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DIE WITH US RESENTING HER. (LAUGHTER) ANIMATION. THAT STILL DOESN'T GET US ALL THE MONEY WE NEED.
Jon: OH, OUR OLDER BROTHER, I FORGOT, GORDON, HE RUNS THE HEDGE FUND. MAYBE COKICK IN IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME, JUST A LITTLE EXTRA, NOT A LOT. A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS. WOULDN'T MAKE A DENT IN HIS LIFESTYLE, NOT TO MENTION AT ONE POINT WE BAILED HIM OUT  WHEN HE WAS HAVING FINANCIAL TROUBLES. YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT PLAN COULD WORK.
GOVERNMENTS MORE AND MORE WANT TO SUBSIDIZE FAILURE AND THEY WANT TO PUNISH SUCCESS.
SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING EVERYONE TO BE SUCCESSFUL, EVERYONE TO BE WEALTHY, NOT PUNISH THOSE WHO ACHIEVE SUCCESS.
Jon: OH, RIGHT, GIVING IT BACK TO THE TAX RATES OF THE 90s THAT WOULD BE PUNISHING  SUCCESS WHEREAS GRANDMA AND QUID PRO QUO DISASTER RELIEF THING ONLY PUNISHES, AGE, ILLNESS AND MISFORTUNE.
Jon: THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER PONT, I HATE TO BRING THIS UP AND SAY THIS. CAN WE TALK ABOUT DAD'S CAR. IT TAKES UP SO MUCH OF THE FAMILY BUDGET. YEAH. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: I REALLY DON'T KNOW. BOY, I-- I GUESS YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT THE NEIGHBORS  BUT DOES IT REALLY NEED TO HAVE NUCLEAR CAPABILITY AND STEALTH MODE. WE ALREADY KILLED THE KID WITHOUT EGGED OUR HOUSE TEN YEARS AGO. AND BURIED HIM AT SEA. METAPHOR BREAKING, MUST TRY TO EXTEND. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE, TORNADO PEOPLE, I'VE GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS. WE CRUNCHED SOME NUMBERS, CHECKED INTO IT AND I'M AFRAID ARE YOU ALL GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE OUTSIDE FROM HERE ON OUT. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS DAD'S CAR IS GETTING A NEW LASER CANON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
