(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE HOST OF CNN'S "FAREED ZAKARIA G.P.S."  AND EDITOR AT LARGE FOR "TIME" MAGAZINE AND HIS BOOK HAS BEEN  FULLY REVISED AND UPDATED, THE NEW EDITION IS CALLED "THE POST-AMERICAN WORLD RELEASE  2.0." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM FAREED ZAKARIA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU?
I LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR TEN MINUTES AFTER THE GREEN ROOM AND YOU DESTROY YOURSELF.
Jon: I AM AN IDIOT. I REALLY AM AN IDIOT. I'M A BARTENDER. HOW MANY YEARS HAVE I BAR TENDED...
YOU WERE A BARTENDER.
Jon: I'M SMASHING GLASSES AGAINST THE PODIUM THINKING "WHAT WILL HAPPEN? I DON'T KNOW." (LAUGHTER) NICE TO SEE YOU.
Jon: PLEASURE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: WE GOT SO MUCH GOING ON IN THE WORLD. NORMALLY WE TALK FOREIGN POLICY. I WANT TO TALK OUR ECONOMY IN RELATION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. HAVE WE FALLEN BEHIND? ARE WE THE ECONOMIC SUPERPOWER WE ONCE WERE?
WE'RE STILL THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD BY FAR. BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE EMERGING RIGHT NOW IN THE ECONOMY. IF YOU LOOK AT AMERICAN CORPORATIONS ARE DOING FANTASTIC. THEY HAVE ACCESS TO CHEAP CAPITAL, THEY CAN FIND CHEAP LABOR IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE  WORLD, THEY USE GREAT TECHNOLOGY SO THE S&P 500 IS GREAT, THE STOCK MARKET IS UP 85% RIGHT NOW. BUT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WORKER'S FATE IS IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE. THEY'RE STUCK IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY CAN'T DO THIS GREAT ARBITRAGE. THEIR WAGES HAVE BEEN FLAT FOR TEN YEARS AND...
Jon: CAPITAL IS MOBILE BUT PEOPLE...
EXACTLY. AND SO FOR THEM WHAT YOU HAVE IS THESE TWIN FORCES OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH MEANS MACHINE CANS DO  THINGS PEOPLE USED TO. THERE'S NOW COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT CAN DO STUFF LAWYERS USED TO BE ABLE TO DO. DISCOVERY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. MAY NOT BE SUCH A BAD THING.
Jon: WHAT CAN LAWYERS DO THAT COMPUTERS CAN'T DO? (LAUGHTER).
WELL, IF YOU WANTED TO TRY AND SUE SOMEBODY ABOUT THAT...
Jon: NO, I WOULD NOT! HOW DO YOU SUE SOMEBODY OVER YOUR... WHO COULD I SNY.
JON STEWART?
Jon: MY ARM? I WOULD SUE MY OWN ARM. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? (LAUGHTER).
I THINK THERE WAS A DEFECTIVE MANUFACTURER.
Jon: THERE WAS SOMETHING DEFECTIVE IN THERE, ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER).
BUT THE OTHER PART OF IT IS, OF COURSE, THE FACT THAT YOU CAN MAKE STUFF ALL OVER THE WORLD. SO YOU TAKE TECHNOLOGY, YOU TAKE GLOBALIZATION. FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER, THIS IS REALLY INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE  AMERICAN LABOR IS RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE NINE MILLION... SEVEN MILLION OFFICIALLY UNEMPLOYED  BUT YOU ADD UP ALL THE PEOPLE WHO STOPPED LOOKING FOR WORK. YOU ADD UP THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PART-TIME JOBS AND THESE PART-TIME JOBS PAY HALF AS MUCH  AS THE MEDIAN WAGE. THAT'S 24 MILLION PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO ARE UNDER EMPLOYED OR UNEMPLOYED AND THOSE NUMBERS  AREN'T GETTING BETTER. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET IT ASSUMES WE WILL CREATE 20 MILLION JOBS.
Jon: BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THEM, IT'S BEEN A YEAR. AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT JOBS THIS AND JOBS THAT AND WE'VE GOT TO  DO SOMETHING ANT THE ECONOMY. I CANNOT POINT TO ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY HAS DONE TO ALLEVIATE THIS. AND THE ONLY THING I'M HEARING RIGHT NOW IS A REPUBLICAN PLAN THAT WE NEED TO CUT, WE NEED TO  MAKE IT BETTER FOR CORPORATIONS. BUT IT FEELS TO ME A FOOL'S ERRAND TO CHASE THE IDEA THAT WE CAN CREATE CONDITIONS AS  CONDUCIVE FOR CORPORATIONS AS IT IS IN INDIA AND CHINA. AMERICANS WILL NOT AND SHOULD NOT LIVE LIKE THOSE WORKERS. WE'VE EARNED OUR MIDDLE-CLASS STATUS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT... HOW IS IT THAT IF YOU MAKE OUR COUNTRY MORE CONDUCIVE TO CORPORATIONS YOU WILL BRING THOSE BACK? WE JUST CAN'T COMPETE.
WELL, CERTAINLY NOT IN THE SHORT TERM. IF YOU CUT BUDGETS IN THE SHORT TERM YOU'RE LAYING OFF SCHOOL TEACHERS, YOU'RE LAYING OFF  FIREFIGHTERS, YOU'RE LAYING OFF POLICEMEN. AND WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK OF THE LONG-TERM TRAJECTORY OF THAT, THAT MAYBE GOVERNMENT  BECOMES LEANER AND MEANER, IN THE SHORT RUN THAT'S MORE PEOPLE  UNEMPLOYED, FEWER PEOPLE WHO CAN BUY STUFF, FEWER PEOPLE GOING TO DINERS, FEWER PEOPLE  CONTRIBUTING TO THE ECONOMY. I THINK OUR MEASURE SHOULD BE-- AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS I TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK-- THE  MEASURE SHOULD BE A COUNTRY LIKE GERMANY. GERMANY HAS MANAGED TO MAINTAIN ITS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY EVEN  THOUGH IT IS ONE OF THE... IT'S GOT PRETTY HIGH TAXES, A LOT OF REGULATIONS, UNIONS AND WHY? BECAUSE THEY VIEW GOVERNMENT IN A POSITIVE WAY, WHICH IS GOVERNMENT INVESTS IN  TECHNOLOGY, IN SCIENCE, IN TECHNICAL INSTITUTES, IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. IT TRIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS THAT YOU CAN DO POSITIVELY TO GROW THE ECONOMY. OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE PRIVATE SECTOR ECONOMY AND YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK  AT REGULATIONS AND YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT ALL THAT.
Jon: BUT THAT'S SUGGESTING WE HAVE NO COHERENT DOMESTIC  MANUFACTURING OR LABOR POLICY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND IS THAT... WE DON'T.
Jon: (LAUGHS)
TO BE FAIR, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. THEY'RE TRYING TO DOUBLE EXPORTS, BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT GOVERNMENT  CAN DO POSITIVELY. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF STUFF THAT WE KNOW THAT GOVERNMENT SCREWS  UP AND DOESN'T DO RIGHT AND THAT'S FINE AND WE SHOULD... YOU  KNOW, WE SHOULD TRY AND MAKE IT A MORE REGULATORY FRIENDLY AND TAX FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT. BUT THERE'S ALSO STUFF THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT MADE SILICON VALLEY, SILICON VALLEY  WAS MADE BY A GREAT STATE EDUCATION SYSTEM. THESE AMAZING,CAL CAMPUSES, A GREAT EDUCATION SYSTEM. IT WAS MADE BY DEPARTMENT DEMAND FOR ENGINEERS. LOCKHEED, ALL THESE COMPANIES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT USED TO BUY EVERY COMPUTER CHIP THAT WAS MANUFACTURED.
Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING THE KEY IS EDUCATION AND WAR. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, WAR HAS...
Jon: IF WE CAN JUST KEEP STARTING WORLD WARS AND DOUBLING BACK DOWN ON G.I. BILLS WE CAN  HAVE THIS THING WORKED OUT.
WORLD WARS ARE REALLY USEFUL. SMALL WARS DON'T HELP AT ALL.
Jon: (LAUGHS). (LAUGHTER).
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DESTROY THE OTHER COMPETITORS. THAT WAS THE GREAT THING ABOUT WORLD WAR II. YOU FLATTEN THE OTHER COMPETITORS, YOU'RE LEFT ON TOP... (AUDIENCE REACTS) THIS IS THE STEWART/ZAKARIA PLAN.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHY NO ONE'S RUNNING ON THAT PLATFORM. (LAUGHTER) AMERICA! WE'LL FLATTEN YOU. (LAUGHTER).
AND THEN WE'LL SELL TO YOU.
Jon: THEN WE'LL SELL YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO REBUILD. A PERFECT SYSTEM. ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU. "THE POST-AMERICAN WORLD RELEASE 2.0." LIKE HOW I THREW THAT IN THERE? ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW, FAREED
