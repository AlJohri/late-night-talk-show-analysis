Jon:  MY GUEST TONIGHT, LEGENDARY PERFORMER. HE'S WON 15 GRAMMYS. HIS NEW ALBUM IS CALLED "DIDDID YOUETS 2." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, TONY BENNETT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ♪ ♪ ♪.
THANK YOU. WOW.
Jon:  LOOK AT YOU! LOOK AT YOU! YOU LOOK GREAT. THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE US.
OH, I LOVE IT. THANK YOU.
Jon:  THIS-- THIS "DID YOUETS TWO" I JUST WANT TO SAY  RIGHT HERE, "TONY BENNETT:  DID YOUETS TWO," THE NUMBER ONE ALBUM IN THE COUNTRY, AM I CORRECT?
YES.
Jon:  NUMBER ONE ALBUM ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IS THERE ANY OTHER PERFORMER YOU  CAN THINK OF THAT HAS BEEN ON THE CHARTS-- WHEN DID YOU FIRST START CHARTING, 50s?
IN THE 50s, YES.
Jon:  THE 50s, 60s, 70S, 80s. YOU'VE BEEN ON THE CHARTS EVERY DECADE.
RIGHT.
Jon:  IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE IN HISTORY, OTHER THAN LIKE BEETHOVEN, IS THERE ANYBODY THAT  HAS THAT TYPE OF RECORD THAT YOU KNOW OF? WOULD YOU EVEN-- WOULD YOU FOLLOW THAT?
I THINK IT'S THE FIRST.
Jon:  IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S A REMARKABLE THING. NOW, YOU HAVE-- THESE ARE-- HOW MANY DUETS?
ABOUT 19.
Jon:  19. WHO SUCKED? WHO WAS TERRIBLE? ( LAUGHTER )
THEY WERE ALL WONDERFUL. REALLY, I REALLY MEAN IT. THEY WERE ALL GREAT.
Jon:  NO, I KNOW. THIS IS REALLY NICE.
THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT, MOST POPULAR YOUNG ARTISTS TODAY THAT ARE DOING VERY WELL.
Jon:  AND THEY'RE-- IS THERE ANYBODY THAT WOULDN'T? BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE-- IF TONY BENNETT CALLS YOU AND SAYS, "HEY, MAN, YOU WANT TO SING A SONG," I WOULD THINK IT WAS THE HONOR OF THEIR YEARS?
WELL, I MUST SAY, MY SON IS MY WONDERFUL MANAGER FOR LAST 45  YEARS, AND HE CAME UP WITH THIS WHOLE PREMISE AND I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR DOING THAT.
Jon:  THAT'S DANNY. A GOOD MAN, VERY NICE GUY.
THANK YOU.
Jon:  HE WILL, THOUGH, BECAUSE I'VE WORKED WITH HIM BEFORE, GETTING YOU TO DO GIGS, HE WILL MUFFLE YOU ( LAUGHTER ) HE CAN BE A VICIOUS MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT WAS IT LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU DID A DUET WITH AMY WINE HOUSE.
RIGHT.
Jon:  WERE YOU IN THE STUDIO WITH HER?
I WAS. ABBEY ROAD IN BRITAIN. AND WAS IT WAS THE LAST RECORD THAT SHE MADE, YES.
Jon:  IS THAT-- IS IT-- IS IT-- WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH SOMEBODY IN THAT SITUATION--  AND, LOOK, LET'S NOT BE NAIVE. YOU'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY SINCE THE 50s. YOU'VE SEEN PEOPLE STRUGGLE. YOU'VE UNFORTUNATELY SEEN PEOPLE DIE TOO YOUNG. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU FEEL FROM A PERFORMER OR IS IT ALL JUST BUSINESS? DO YOU GET A SENSE THAT THERE'S-- THAT THERE'S TROUBLE THERE?
WELL, SHE WAS IN TROUBLE AT THAT TIME BECAUSE SHE HAD A COUPLE OF ENGAGEMENTS THAT SHE  DIDN'T KEEP UP, BUT WHAT PEOPLE DIDN'T REALIZE AT THAT TIME, THAT SHE REALLY KNEW-- IN FACT, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WHEN WE WERE MAKE THE RECORD AND NOW LOOKING AT THE WHOLE THING-- SHE  KNEW THAT SHE WAS IN A LOT OF TROUBLE, THAT SHE WASN'T GOING TO LIVE.
Jon:  WOW.
YOU KNOW. AND IT WASN'T DRUGS. IT WAS-- IT WAS ALCOHOL.
Jon:  RIGHT.
TOWARD THE END, YOU KNOW. AND IT WAS-- IT WAS SUCH A SAD THING BECAUSE SHE WAS REALLY-- SINCE ELVIS PRESLEY AND THE  BEATLES AND THE ROLLING STONES AND THE WHOLE CONTEMPORARY CHANGE THAT CAME IN, SHE WAS THE  ONLY SINGER THAT REALLY SANG WHAT I CALL THE RIGHT WAY.
Jon:  REALLY?
YEAH, BECAUSE SHE'S-- SHE WAS A GREAT JAZZ POP SINGER, AND SHE  WAS A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE WHOLE THING WHEN WE WERE DOING THE RECORD, BUT I-- I CAME  UP WITH ONE SENTENCE THAT MADE EVERYTHING WORK. AND I JUST SAID, "YOU KNOW," I SAID, "I MAY BE WRONG BUT I BET  YOU'RE INFLUENCED BY DINAH WASHINGTON." AND WHEN SHE HEARD THAT, SHE  SAID, "OH, MY GOD. THAT'S MY GOD. THAT'S WHO I LOVE." AND IT REALLY CHANGED THE WHOLE RECORD, AND SHE ACTUALLY USED  SOME DINAH WASHINGTON PHRASES IN THE RECORDING AND THE-- YOU COULD TELL WHEN YOU HEAR THE  RECORD HOW WONDERFUL SHE-- SHE WAS REALLY A GREAT JAZZ SINGER, A TRUE JAZZ SINGER. AND THAT-- I REGRET THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO SING.
Jon:  RIGHT. AND YOU-- IN YOUR-- YOU REALLY ARE INTUITIVE NOW ABOUT THE MUSIC, AREN'T YOU? LIKE YOU CAN JUST FEEL IT FROM PEOPLE. YOU'VE DONE IT LONG ENOUGH THAT KNOW-- WILL YOU SEE AN ARTIST SOMETIMES ON TELEVISION, OR  YOU'LL HEAR THEM, AND YOU'LL GO, THAT'S SOMEBODY I'LL CLICK WITH OR CAN YOU HEAR SOMEBODY'S  PHRASING AND THINK NOT SURE I CAN BLEND THAT. CAN YOU FEEL THE INGREDIENT THAT WILL WORK WITH YOU THAT WILL MAKE A GREAT RECORD?
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION HERE, YOU KNOW, I WAS 10 YEARS YOUNGER THAN THE GREAT MASTER FRANK SINATRA, NAT KING COLE, AND  BILLY EPSTEIN, AND SARAH VAUGHN, AND ELLA FITZGERALD, WHO IS BETTER THAN ANYBODY, AND THEN LOUIS ARMSTRONG. SO I GREW UP LOVING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. IT DOESN'T SOUND DATED TO ME. ANY OF THE RECORDINGS, EVEN TODAY WHEN YOU HEAR A NAT COLE RECORD, IT DOESN'T SOUND OLD  FASHIONED, YOU KNOW. SO CORPORATIONS WILL SAY, WELL, THAT'S OLD MUSIC." BUT TO ME IT'S NOT. IT'S GOING TO LAST FOREVER. SINATRA, ELLA FITZGERALD, LOUIS ARMSTRONG, IS GOING TO SOUND GREAT 50 GEARS NOW.
Jon:  YOU KNOW WHO ELSE?
WELL, THEY WERE MY MASTERS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  I'M TELLING YOU, MAN. WHEN YOU CAME OUT FOR US-- WHEN YOU CAME OUT FORINOUS WASHINGTON, I'M TELLING YOU, THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON I WANTED AT THE END THERE STANDING UP AT THE CAPITOL SINGING TO  THOSE PEOPLE AND YOU JUST-- YOU EXCEEDED EXPECTING AS, AS YOU ALWAYS DO. IT'S JUST AN HONOR TO SEE YOU.
THAT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENT IN MY LIFE BECAUSE TO  SING "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL" RIGHT THERE WITH THE CAPITOL BEHIND US AND THE FLAG.
Jon:  IT WAS SOMETHING, BABY.
THANK YOU.
