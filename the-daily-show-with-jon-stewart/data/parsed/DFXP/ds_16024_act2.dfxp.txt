(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK. MUSLIMS ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE FINDING THEIR VOICE USING SOCIAL MEDIA BUT DOES A MORE  TRADITIONAL FORM HOLD THE KEY TO THEIR SUCCESS? AASIF MANDVI HAS MORE.
THE REVOLUTION IN EGYPT HAS LED MANY AROUND THE WORLD TO SEE  ISLAM IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LIGHT. BUT IN AMERICA, MUSLIMS STILL HAVE A SERIOUS IMAGE PROBLEM. FORTUNATELY, A SOLUTION MAY BE AT HAND.
"THE COSBY SHOW" DID SO MUCH TO CHANGE ATTITUDES ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICANS.
RIGHT.
MAYBE WE NEED A MUSLIM VERSION OF THE COSBY SHOW.
YES, AMERICANS HAVE HISTORICALLY TURNED TO TELEVISION TO SOLVE OUR MOST  VEXING SOCIAL ISSUES. FROM WOMEN'S RIGHTS ALL THE WAY TO GAY MARRIAGE. BUT ERADICATING ISLAMOPHOBIA WOULDN'T BE EASY. I NEEDED A MAN WHO KNEW A THING OR TWO ABOUT GETTING MUSLIMS ON T.V.
IMAM PHIAL IS RAUF IS THE MAN BEHIND THE PROPOSAL TO BUILD THE  MOSQUE STEPS AWAY FROM GROUND ZERO.
PERFECT.
I THOUGHT KATIE COURIC'S SUGGESTION FOR A BILL COSBY STYLE COMEDY SHOW IS A WONDERFUL IDEA. BUT THE SHIFT OF PERCEPTIONS ABOUT MUSLIMS WILL REQUIRE MORE THAN JUST A BILL COSBY SHOW. BILL COSBY SHOW WILL BE A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR.
ALSO LIKE A MUSLIM "JEFFERSONS." (LAUGHTER)
UM...
AND NO ONE KNOWS BETTER HOW TO CREATE A MUSLIM COSBY SHOW THAN ALVIN POUSSAINT, THE HIGH  VARD PSYCHOLOGIST WHO SERVED AS A CONSULTANT ON THE ORIGINAL COSBY SHOW WHICH CURED RACISM  AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) WHAT WOULD THE MUSLIM COSBY SHOW LOOK LIKE?
WHAT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO WITH A SHOW WITH MUSLIMS IS JUST HAVE THEM BE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. WE'RE ALL BASICALLY AMERICAN.
SO WE SHOULD PORTRAY MUSLIMS AS GOOD PEOPLE?
YES.
GENIUS, GENIUS. BUT IT WON'T BE EASY TO CHANGE AMERICA'S PERCEPTIONS OF MUSLIMS  FROM THIS INTO SOMETHING THEY COULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH. (LAUGHTER) HOW MUSLIM CAN WE GET AWAY WITH?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "HOW MUSLIM"?
SHOULD WE GET RID OF THE BEARDS?
WELL, SEAN CONNERY HAS A BEARD.
OKAY, SO WE KNOW WHO WOULD STAR IN THE MUSLIM REMAKE OF  "FINDING FORESTER" BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MUSLIM COSBY SHOW?
I DON'T KNOW A MUSLIM BILL COSBY.
ANYBODY COME TO MIND?
NO. I DON'T...
JUMP INTO YOUR HEAD.
NO. I WOULD... I KNOW THERE ARE MUSLIM COMEDIANS.
RUDY!
BUT THAT COULD BE MY IGNORANCE.
JELL-O PUDDING POPS, ANYBODY?
YOU COME TO MIND. YOU'RE MUSLIM, RIGHT?
ME? ME? (LAUGHS) YOU GUYS! SEE, I COULD DO IT. SO WE SHOT A PILOT AND ASSEMBLED A TEST AUDIENCE OF THE KIND OF PEOPLE WE WOULD HAVE TO WIN OVER. AVERAGE AMERICANS.
ISLAM IS REALLY SHOWN TO BE A VIOLENT RELIGION, A HOSTILE RELIGION.
IT'S NOT REALLY A RELIGION. IT'S MORE OF A STRUCTURED GOVERNMENT ORGANIZED TYPE THING.
I THINK THEY HAVE GREAT P.R., I THINK THEY HAVE GREAT PROPAGANDA BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY DO.
IT WAS TIME TO WIN SOME HEARTS AND MINDS. (LAUGHTER) I HAD THEM RIGHT WHERE I WANTED THEM. SOMEONE MADE SNACKS FOR HIS HARD-WORKING KIDS!
OH, THANKS, DAD!
TOMMY!
YEAH?
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO LISTEN TO YOUR IPOD  WHILE YOU'RE DOING YOUR HOME WORK!
YOUR FATHER'S RIGHT, HONEY.
COME ON, IT'S THE NEW TOBY KEITH ALBUM.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US? WHY WHAT ARE YOU HOGGING IT ALL TO YOURSELF FOR? TURN IT UP! ♪ HEAD ON DOWN TO THE MAIN ATTRACTION... ♪
SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU GUYS WERE PRAYING! PRAYING! NO, NO, UNLESS YOU MEAN PRAYING TO THE GOD OF OKLAHOMA COUNTRY MUSIC! WHOO! NOW, YOU GUYS GET CRACKING AND DON'T FORGET TO DRINK YOUR PORK JUICE.
YEAH, PORK JUICE!
YOU GOT A D IN ALGEBRA, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
DON'T BLOW UP AT HIM AGAIN! (AUDIENCE REACTS)
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? BLOW UP. I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THAT'S A VERY STRANGE WAY TO PUT THINGS, ALL RIGHT? (APPLAUSE) WELL, IF THAT DIDN'T WIN THEM OVER I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL. DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SHOW WOULD CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS MUSLIMS?
NO.
NO.
IT'S NOT ANYTHING I WOULD EVER WATCH OR BELIEVE OR THINK FOR TWO SECONDS THAT THIS IS  LIKE A REGULAR MUSLIM FAMILY.
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PORTRAY MUSLIMS HE SHOULD TALK ABOUT MAYBE ISLAM.
YOU WANT TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE DO A KORAN JOKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCENE.
WOW. I HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN.
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THAT CLOSET TERRORIST OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW? THEY'VE GOT TO KEEP HIM HIDDEN BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE REST  OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO KNOW.
THE MORE JOKES ABOUT TERRORISTS...
YOU COULD HAVE AN UNCLE RAHIB OR SOMETHING WHO CAME OVER AND  HE'S BEDOUIN AND HE LIVES IN THE BASEMENT WITH A SANDBOX AND A GET TO.
RIGHT.
SO APPARENTLY THE BEST WAY FOR A SHOW TO COMBAT MUSLIM STEREOTYPES IS TO CONFIRM MUSLIM STEREOTYPES.
NEXT TIME ON THE "QU'OSBY SHOW," A SPECIAL VISIT FROM THE PROPHET MOHAMMED.
WHAT? NO! NO!
Jon: AASIF
