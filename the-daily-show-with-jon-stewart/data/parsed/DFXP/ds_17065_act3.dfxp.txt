IT'S OVER THE EDGE.

I MADE IT. THIS IS WHAT I'M SHOOTING FOR. SIX SEVEN IT'S TOO BEIGE BIG. MOST BEDS ARE SIX SIX. IT'S A PAIN BEING THIS TALL.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT -- AND YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER THIS, WHAT DO YOU  REMEMBER ABOUT FIVE SEVEN?
I REMEMBER THINKING THIS IS A GOOD HEIGHT FOR A CHILD. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S MY MEMORY OF IT.
Jon: THERE'S A CERTAIN WONDERMENT WHEN YOU ARE FIVE  SEVEN IT'S LIKE OH, MY GOSH -- YOU DON'T FIND OUT THAT IT'S  SNOWING UNTIL EVERYONE ELSE DOES.
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, IF I WANT THAT MAGICAL FEELING I'LL JUST SPEND THE DAY AT FIVE SEVEN.
Jon: IS IT THAT BIG OF A CROUCH?
PRETTY MUCH.
Jon: IF YOU REMOVED YOUR FEMURS.
RIGHT. OKAY, YES.
Jon: WHAT IF WE SHARED HALF A FEMUR. THE THINGS THAT THEY DO NOW SURGICALLY. AGAIN, WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS.

YOU WANT MY THREE INCHES? IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE AFTER. [ LAUGHTER ]

Jon: CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU. NO ONE WAS INJURED SO WE CAN LAUGH ABOUT IT. TALK ABOUT THE HEIGHT THING. A WOMAN WALKED OUT IN FRONT OF THE CAR CAR AHEAD OF ME SO I SLAMMED MY BRAKES BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. I HIT THE DUDE IN FRONT OF ME BECAUSE I'M SO TALL I HAVE TO PUT THE SEAT RIGHT BACK. I WAS DRIVING A VOLVO AND THE AIR BAG WENT OFF BUT DIDN'T REACH MY HEIGHT. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE, JON. [ LAUGHTER ] I SORT OF WENT -- JUST GAVE UP. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT. AND IT ANGERED ME. I THOUGHT THE VOLVO WAS THE SAFEST CAR IN THE WORLD. HOW TALL ARE THE CRASH TEST DUMMIES. THEY ARE YOUR HEIGHT.
Jon: FOR ME I'M NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE IT BECAUSE IT COULD CAUSE A FATALITY. THEY ARE LIKE IT'S GOING TO DECAPTIATE THIS POOR LITTLE MAN. I'M SO GLAD YOU ARE ALL RIGHT AND I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS SHOW. LIFE'S TOO SHORT AIRS SUNDAY ON HBO IT'S SO G. I USED TO THINK  RICKY WAS A POWERHOUSE IN COME BY BUT CLEARLY NOW I REALIZE YOU ARE CARRYING THIS MAN. AND YOU CAN TELL HIM I SAID THAT.
