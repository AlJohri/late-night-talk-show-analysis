Jon: DID YOU SEE CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL ON THE SHOW? YOU DIDN'T SEE THE WHOLE INTERVIEW. THERE'S MORE. ON THE WEBB. "ON THE WEBB." DOES THE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT ADEQUATELY THOUGH  MAKE IT A FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT HAVING THAT RESPONSIBILITY? DOES THEIR INABILITY TO DO IT EFFECTIVELY MAKE IT SO THAT THEY SHOULDN'T DO IT?
IN A WAY ESPECIALLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, YOU KNOW, UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION....
Jon: AREN'T THEY A MARKET SYSTEM? WOULDN'T YOU RATHER HAVE PEOPLE REGULATING THAT ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO VOTERS THAN  CORPORATIONS REGULATING THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO SHAREHOLDERS? ISN'T OUR SYSTEM... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YES. I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY AS UNFAIR OR MAYBE NOT AS GOOD AS IT COULD BE AT LEAST THEY'RE  ACCOUNTABLE TO US.
BUT THE REGULATIONS ARE STRICTER IN THE MARKETPLACE. FOR INSTANCE THE REGULATIONS... THE REGULATORS HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THE HOUSING INDUSTRY. WE HAVE MORE MORTGAGE COMPANIES. THEY HAD A BIG BUBBLE. THEY MADE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAD A HOUSE. WELL THEY GO BROKE. THE REGULATORS GOT BAILED OUT. THE PEOPLE WHO CONTROLLED THE REGULATIONS. THEY BAIL OUT THE BIG COMPANIES. THE MIDDLE CLASS LOSE THEIR JOBS AND THEY LOSE THEIR HOUSES. SO ALL THIS TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT BIG CORPORATIONS WON'T HURT  THEM ACTUALLY IS A BACKFIRE ON THEM. THE REGULATIONS ARE MUCH TOUGHER IN THE FREE MARKET BECAUSE YOU CANNOT COMMIT FRAUD. YOU CANNOT STEAL. YOU CANNOT HURT PEOPLE. AND THE FAILURE HAS COME THAT GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T ENFORCE THIS. IN THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, THERE WAS A COLLUSION. YOU COULD POLLUTE. THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT. BUT IN A TRUE FREE MARKET IN A LIBERTARIAN SOCIETY YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
Jon: WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE SAYING A TRUE LIBERTARIAN SOCIETY YOU HAVE  TO BE RESPONSIBLE. HAS THAT EVER BEEN TRIED? BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN HONEST QUESTION TO SAY, IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN YOU SAY, WELL, THE  FREE MARKET WOULD ACTUALLY REGULATE THAT MUCH BETTER. BUT I THINK IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TO  FEEL LIKE THAT IS IN ANY WAY NOT A PIPE DREAM. I DON'T MEAN THAT AS.... ( APPLAUSE )
NO, IT'S BEEN TRIED. IT'S NEVER BEEN PERFECT BUT HAS SOCIALISM AND AUTHORITARIANISM EVER BEEN PERFECT? IT'S HORRIBLE. YOU LOSE ALL YOUR FREEDOMS THAT WAY.
Jon: IS THAT OUR CHOICE? AUTHORITARIANISM AND TYRANNY OR A FREE MARKET THAT WE MUST TRUST? ISN'T THERE A GROUND OF KPE DENSE....
I THINK IF YOU PLANT A SEED IT TENDS TO GROW. I USED TO NEVER BE ABLE TO GET AWAY. WITH TELLING A WOMAN IT'S A TOUCH OF PREGNANCY. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. IF YOU GET GOVERNMENT INVOLVED THERE TENDS TO BE A GROWTH. A LITTLE BIT OF INCOME TAX, 1% AND THEN BEFORE YOU HAVE A MONSTER OUT THERE. SO, NO, IT GROWS. WHEN YOU GIVE UP 100% OF THE PRINCIPLE IF YOU START SAYING THE GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO DO IT. UNDER OUR SYSTEM SINCE I DON'T EXPECT A PERFECT SOCIETY OR A PERFECT FREE SOCIETY. BUT WE HAD A GRAND EXPERIMENT, THE BEST EVER AND THE FREEEST AND THE MOST PROSPEROUS. BUT ONE OF THE RULES THEY HAD TO SORT OF TAKE CARE OF THIS BLEND THAT YOU MIGHT BE  LOOKING FOR IS THAT WE HAVE NO PROHIBITIONS AGAINST THE STATE. SO IF YOU SORT OF LIKE THIS STUFF, YOU KNOW, LET BLOOMBERG WRITE ALL THE REGULATIONS. LET SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT.
Jon: OPPRESSION IS NOT OKAY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT IF YOUR STATE WANTS TO OPPRESS  YOU... I GOT IT.
YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL. YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER IT IF IT'S LOCAL. IT'S NOT LIKE SAYING THAT YOU WERE ARGUING THE CASE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF  GOVERNMENT TO RESCUE THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY NEED IT. DO IT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU WE'RE NOT VERY EFFICIENT IN WASHINGTON. YOU KNOW, WE'VE RUN UP A DEBT.
Jon: I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT.
JUST THINK ABOUT IT, IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH THESE THINGS, THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THE PENTAGON. DO YOU WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO THE PENTAGON OR THE C.I.A. OR THE T.S.A.? AND SEE HOW GOOD THEY ARE SNONT YOU WON'T WORRY THAT THE STATES WOULD DEVELOP THEIR OWN MECHANISMS.
LET'S HOPE THE PEOPLE WOULD WORK ON IT AND MAKE IT, YOU KNOW, DUE... DECENT. THAT WAS THE WONDERFUL PART ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. LOOK HOW THE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS IN SOME OF THE MID WESTERN STATES DESTROYED THEIR JOBS  AND THEY MOVED SOUTH BECAUSE THEY HAD MORE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR WORKING  CONDITIONS AND LESS TAXES. SO PEOPLE MIGRATED DOWN. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE WHOLE COUNTRY....
Jon: NOW IT'S A GLOBAL CORRECTION. WE HAVE TO GO DOWN ALL THE WAY TO LIKE CHINA.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT WE'VE UNDERMINED OUR WHOLE ENVIRONMENT. OUR MONETARY SYSTEM, OUR TAX SYSTEM. THE REGULATORY SYSTEM. SO THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO. SO THEY DO GO OVERSEAS. WE'VE CHASED OUR JOBS OVERSEAS. THAT'S STRONGLY RELATED TO THE MONETARY SYSTEM TOO. WHEN YOU PRINT MONEY IT'S A GOOD EXPORT. JUST EXPORT OUR MONEY. AS LONG AS THEY TAKE IT, WE CAN BUY STUFF FOR FREE. THAT'S OUR BIG PROBLEM.
Jon: LISTEN, IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU. I ALWAYS ENJOY OUR CONVERSATIONS. YOU REALLY ARE ONE OF OUR LAST CONSISTENT POLITICIANS WE SEE IN THIS WORLD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL.
