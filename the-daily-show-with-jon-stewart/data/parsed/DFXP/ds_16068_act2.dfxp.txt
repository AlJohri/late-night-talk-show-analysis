Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! SO DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN FORMER HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  WAS ARRESTED THIS WEEK AFTER AGENCIEDLY SEXUALLY ASSAULTING A HOTEL MADE HAS  POSTED BAIL OF $1 MILLION IN CASH. HOW DOES THE HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND GET THAT KIND-- WELL, THERE  GOES NIGERIA'S MOSQUITO NET MONEY. ALL RIGHT. OBVIOUSLY ONE IS PRESUMED INNOCENT--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. ONE WOULD LIKE TO RESERVE JUDGEMENT, LET THE COURTS DO THEIR WORK. OF COURSE THAT HAS NOT PREVENTED STRAUSS-KAHN SUPPORTERS FROM MAKING THE CASE FOR HIS INNOCENCE. FOR INSTANCE FRENCH PHILOSOPHER BERNARD HENRI LEVY, LOOK IT UP, PEOPLE, THAT'S HOW IT IS PRONOUNCED,--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HE HAS WRITTEN IN AN ESSAY, QUOTE, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED SATURDAY. BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW HOW A CHAMBER MADE COULD HAVE WALKED IN ALONE, CONTRARY TO THE HABITUAL PRACTICE OF MOST OF NEW YORK'S HOTELS OF SENDING A  CLEANING BRIGADE OF TWO PEOPLE INTO THE ROOM. THAT'S YOUR GOTCHA? EVERYONE KNOWS MADES COME IN PAIRS? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND BY THE WAY, ONLY THE FRENCH WOULD REFER TO TWO MADES AS A BRIGADE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: AND THAT'S JUST JUST-- INTERESTING, LITTLE KNOWN FACT. IN WORLD WAR II GERMANY'S ORIGINAL CONQUERING FORCE THROUGH PARIS WAS ACTUALLY  JUST A CLEANING CREW. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ACROSS THE RHINE AND INTO PARIS, NOTHING MORE THAN A PUSH BROOM AND DECORATIVE SOAPS. LOOK, ALL RIGHT, THREE NAMED FRENCH GUYS A HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER. BUT STRAUSS-KAHN HAS A SECOND DEFENDER WITH EQUALLY AIRTIGHT REASONING.
FORMER NIXON SPEECHWRITER BEN STEIN IS MAKING EXCUSES FOR THE GUY.
Jon: BEN STEIN? FROM WIN BEN STEIN'S MONEY? FERRIS BUELLER? THE COMMERCIALS FOR BEACH BALL MOISTURIZER?
STEIN WRITES PROSECUTORS SAY THAT MR. STRAUSS-KAHN FORCED THE COMPLAINANT TO  HAVE ORAL AND OTHER SEX WITH HIM. HOW DID HE HAVE A GUN? DID HE HAVE A KNIFE? HE'S A SHORT, FAT, OLD MAN.
Jon: YES K HE'S NOT MERELY IN THE KIND OF RAPING SHAPE HE USED TO BE IN. I MEAN 15 YEARS AGO THIS GUY WAS A RAPING MACHINE. THAT IS A TERRIBLE DEFENSE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: GOT SOMETHING WORSE?
AND CAN ANYONE TELL ME ANY ECONOMISTS WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF VIOLENT SEX CRIMES? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ANYONE, ANYONE? ANYONE? BUMER-- BUHLER? BUHLER? SO NOT BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY ECONOMISTS WHO HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED PEOPLE IS EVIDENCE OF  STRAUSS-KAHN'S EVIDENCE. OF COURSE THAT WOULD MEAN ON THE FLIP SIDE A LAUNDRY LIST OF ECONOMISTS WHO COMMITTED  SECT ALL CRIMES WOULD BE IPSO FACTO EVIDENCE OF HIS GILL. IF IT PLEASES THE COURT, RICHARD NYWANGA ECONOMICS PROFESSOR IN STRAUSSBERG UNIVERSITY CONVICTED OF SECTION ASSAULT, ROBERT  VANDER HOE, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR AT ROCKFORD COLLEGE PLED GUILTY OF SEXUAL ABUSE LAST DECEMBER  AND ROBERT MABUSH, A FRENCH ECONOMIST WHO WORKED AT THE WORLD BANK CONVICTED IN 1997  OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING, WAIT FOR IT, A HOUSEKEEPER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL A CORDING TO MY DATA, ECONOMISTS ARE THE RAPIEST PROFESSION GOING. IT TURNS DOURBT -- (APPLAUSE)
Jon: THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET IS VERY  [BLEEP] TOUCHY-FEELY. SO I REALLY HOPE-- IT IS A REDISTRIBUTION OF RAPE. I HOPE YOU HAVE SOMETHING BEYOND COME ON, ECONOMISTS DON'T DO THAT. BESIDES, YOU'VE BARELY EVEN DEGRADED THE VICTIM YET.
HE GOES ON TO WRITE I'VE HAD HOTEL MADES THAT WERE COMPLETE LUNATICS.
Jon: AND THERE YOU GO. A LITTLE BIT OF ADVICE. THE NEXT TIME YOU STAY IN A HOTEL, I URGE YOU, SIR, IF YOU GET TURN DOWN SERVICE, DO NOT EAT THAT CHOCOLATE THEY LEAVE FOR YOU ON THE PILLOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
