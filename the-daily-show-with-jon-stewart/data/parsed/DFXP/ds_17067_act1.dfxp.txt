MARCH 1st, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW  WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT IT GOING FOR YOU TONIGHT. I'M EXCITED. TONIGHT'S PROGRAM, I GET TO TALK ALMOST THE ENTIRE SHOW ABOUT MY TWO FAVORITE SYSTEMS. POLITICAL AND REPRODUCTIVE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NEITHER OF WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN ANY, SHAPE OR FORM. MY GUEST WILL BE CATHLEEN KAVENY, A PROFESSOR OF LAW AND THEOLOGY AT NOTRE DAME  UNIVERSITY AND WE'VE ASKED HER TO COMPANY BY AND HELP ME UNDERSTAND LAW AND THEOLOGY. APPARENTLY THAT SWEET SPOT AT THE INTERSECTION OF LAW STREET AND THEOLOGY AVENUE  HAS NO STOPLIGHT AND A FIRE CAR PILEUP IS ON IT AND THE WHOLE SOCIETY IS VERY UP SET ON IT. IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO THIS ISSUE OF A HEALTH INSURANCE MANDATE THAT REQUIRES  EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE PLANS THAT COVER CONTRACEPTION AS PART OF WOMEN'S PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE. SOME RELIGIOUS GROUPS THAT ALSO HIRE THE UNFORTUNATELY NAMED LADY, HAVE SAID THAT  THIS VIOLATES THEIR PRINCIPLESES. THUS, YESTERDAY, AND TODAY THE UNITED STATES SENATE DEBATED A MEASURE THAT WOULD  ONLY REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE HEALTH-CARE COVERAGE, QUOTE, CONSISTENT WITH THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND MORAL CONVICTIONS. IT'S CALLED THE BLUNT AMENDMENT, AFTER HOW HIGH YOU HAVE TO BE TO THINK  YOU'RE GOING TO PASS IT  [BLEEP] WHAT ARE YOU THINKING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: ALSO THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL IS MISSOURI REPUBLICAN ROY BLUNT. SO THAT ALSO MAY HAVE BEEN-- THAT MAY HAVE PLAYED ALSO A ROLE IN THE NAME. HOW SERIOUS IS THIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW? DAMN THING'S A WEEK OLD AND MITT ROMNEY IS ALREADY TAKE TWO POSITIONS ON IT (LAUGHTER)  AND HE TOOK THE TWO POSITIONS WITHIN THREE AND A HALF HOURS OF EACH OTHER.
-- BEING DEBATED I BELIEVE LATER THIS WE CAN, THAT DEALS WITH BANNING, OR ALLOWING EMPLOYERS TO BAN PROVIDING FEMALE CONTRACEPTION.
YOU HAVE TAKEN A POSITION.
I'M NOT FOR THE BILL. CONDITION TRACEPTION IS WORKING JUST FINE. LET'S JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.
OF COURSE I SUPPORT THE BLUNT AMENDMENT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SOME STATE LAW THAT PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM GETTING CONTRACEPTION. SO I TALKED ABOUT CONTRACEPTIVES BEFORE. SO I REALLY MISUNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION.
Jon: THAT IS-- I GOT-- DOW-- OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY, I SUBMIT TO YOU, A NEW MEASURE OF TIME, THE ROMNEY. (LAUGHTER) JSES IT'S DEFINED AS THE THREE AND A HALF HOUR WINDOW IN WHICH A GROWN MAN RUNNING  FOR PRESIDENT CAN CHANGE HIS DEEPLY HELD CONVICTION TO ITS OPPOSITE. (LAUGHTER) LET ME USE IT IN A SENTENCE FOR YOU. OH MY GOD WE'VE BEEN IN THIS  [BLEEP] FOR TWO AND A HALF ROMNEYS NOW. (LAUGHTER) I NEED TO PEE. NO, I DON'T. BUT IT'S NO WONDER A ROM NAE WAS CONFUSED. THE INTERVIEWER ASKED ROMNEY ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL, AND AS THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR'S  DEBATING THE AMENDMENT YESTERDAY MADE CLEAR, THE BLUNT AMENDMENT HAS NOTHING  TO DO WITH BIRTH CONTROL.
MANY HAVE TRIED TO CHARACTERIZE THIS AMENDMENT AS DENYING WOMEN ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION. THAT'S A RED HERRING.
THE WORD CONTRACEPTION IS NOT IN THERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT A SPECIFIC PROCEDURE.
IT THEY WANT TO SOMEHOW SHROUD THIS, AND VEIL IT AS A WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUE. IT IS CERTAINLY NOT ABOUT CONTRACEPTIVES.
Jon: IT IS ABOUT THE WHORES WHO USE CONTRACEPTIVES. THE AND DANCING. IT'S ABOUT DANCING. IT ALWAYS BEGINS WITH THE DANCING. AND THE FACE PAINT. AND CULOTTES, OH, GARMENT OF TEMPTATION, YOU ARE THE DEVIL'S PANTALONES. FUNNY, YOU WANT TO PRESENT SOME EVIDENCE THAT ISN'T ABOUT CONTRACEPTION?
WELL, I WENT ON THE INTERNET AND I WAS ASKED UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO PUT  INTO THE RECORD AN OPEN LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT THAT IS BEING SIGNED BY WOMEN ALL  OVER THIS COUNTRY.
Jon: OPEN LETTER FROM THE INTERNET. IF OPEN LETTERS FROM THE INTERNETWORKED HALF OUR AUDIENCE WOULD BE UNDERNEATH  A REDWOOD SMOKING-- WEED WITH MUMIO RIGHT NOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DID I SAY HALF, I MEANT 98%. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BY ENTERING THIS LETTER INTO THE RECORD, THAT SENATOR AVOIDS HAVING TO  ACTUALLY READ THAT LETTER OUTLOUD. WHICH MEANS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO TO THE CONGRESSIONAL LETTER TO FIND OUT THAT THIS, NOT ABOUT  CONTRACEPTION LETTER STATES, QUOTE, GOVERNMENT CONTRACEPTIVE PROGRAMS INEVITABLY CHANGE THE SEX, DATING AND MARRIAGE MARKETS IN WAYS THAT LEAD TO MORE EMPTY SEX. AND I'M PRETTY SURE THEY MEANT THAT IN A NEGATIVE WAY. (LAUGHTER) SO WE HAVE HEARD IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT CONTRACEPTION, IT'S REALLY ABOUT LIBERTY AND IF IT'S ABOUT LIBERTY THERE IS ONLY ONE GROUP THAT  HASN'T WEIGHED IN. GENTLEMEN, TO THE FOUNDING FATHERS MOBILE.
WE SHOULD NOT LET A GOVERNMENT INTERFERE IN THESE BASIC RIGHTS OF  CONSCIENCE, A TERM OF THOMAS JEFFERSON WHEN HE WROTE THE NEW LONDON METHODIST IN 1809.
Jon: SO ON THE BLUNT AMENDMENT FOUNDING FATHER THOMAS JEFFERSON VOTES YEA  FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE. YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY OWN WAY OF DEVINING HOW THE FRAMERS WOULD REACT TO MODERN SCENARIOS. TO FIND OUT JOIN ME AT A LOCAL WALGREEN'S FOR AN INSTALLMENT OF THE DAILY  SHOW'S NEW SEGMENT. AH, YES! HELLO! AH, HELLO, HELLO! AH, YES! HELLO, MY GOOD A BOTH CARRY. I AM THOMAS JEFFERSON, I WAS WONDERING IF I MIGHT PROVE YOU A QUESTION. I HAVE THIS SLAVE SALLY--  (LAUGHTER)
OF LATE I'VE BEEN SLIPPING HER A BIT OF THE OLD VIRGINIA HAM. (LAUGHTER) HONEY CURED, IF YOU MUST KNOW. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, AS YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVENTS, THE POINT IS I DON'T THINK AMERICA'S READY  FOR BLACK JEFFERSONS. I MEAN NO ONE, NO ONE WOULD ACCEPT THAT-- OH, OH, AND WHAT ARE THESE? RIGHT ON THE OLD JOHN HANCOCK, EH? PERFECT. AND IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'LL TAKE ANUS WEEKLY, IF YOU WOULD, AND A PACKAGE OF YOUR  FINEST GUM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL WE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO END THAT. (LAUGHTER) SO I WAS GOING TO BE LIKE WELL, I'LL JUST [BLEEP] TAKE THE WIG OFF HOURX ABOUT THAT  I WILL TAKE THE WIG OFF AND JUST TURN. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE SID CAESARS SHOW OF SHOWS. OF COURSE DEMOCRATS ARE DEBATING THE ISSUE AS WELL, LET'S CHECK IN.
JON STEWART TOOK THIS ISSUE ON AND SAID, WELL, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, I LOVE THE BLUNT AMENDMENT, BECAUSE, HE SAY, I'M AN EMPLOYER AND I BELIEVE THAT HUMOR IS THE BEST MEDICINE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, FIRST OF ALL, I CAN'T POSSIBLY SOUND THAT JEWISH. SECOND OF ALL, YOU ARE TAKING THAT OUT OF CONTEXT AND MISCONSTRUING WHAT I  SAID AND THAT'S MY JOB TO DO TO YOU. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS THE BIT WE DID. LOOK AT THE BIT WE DID.
I, ALONG WITH READERS DIGEST MAGAZINE BELIEVE LAUGHTER IS THE BEST  MEDICINE, AND YOU KNOW, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY ONE OF MY WRITERS HAS BEEN FIGHTING  THE FLU FOR SEVERAL WEEKS NOW. HEY, ELLIOTT, COME ON OUT HERE.
THIS IS NOT ANOTHER TREATMENT S IT.
Jon: YEAH, UH--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHY CAN'T YOU GET ME ZITHROMAX.
Jon: ZITHROMAX, THAT SAY FUNNY WORD. THAT'S WHAT WE DID. SEE NOW WHAT HAPPENS TO A DECENT IDEA, ONCE IT HITS THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE.
HUMOR IS THE BEST MEDICINE, HE SAID. SO HE SAID, SO, THAT'S WHAT I AM GOING TO DO. HE SAID I HAVE AN EXAMPLE HERE AND THEN THIS GUY COMES ON TO THE STAGE WITH A VERY  BAD COLD AND FLU AND HE IS SNEEZING AND HE SAYS, MR. STEWART, DO I HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER TREATMENT NOW? AND HE SAYS YES. AND HE STAKES A SELLINGER BOTTLE AND HE SPRAYS IT ALL OVER THE GUY, THAT WAS HIS  TREATMENT BECAUSE IT WAS FUNNY AND HE WAS SUPPOSED TO LAUGH AND THAT WAS SUPPOSED  TO CURE THIS PERSON. AND HE SAID NOT ANOTHER TREATMENT. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHY DON'T YOU JUST PULL MY HEART OUT OF MY CHEST AND EAT IT IN FRONT OF ME. (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY THAT BRINGS DOES TO OUR NEWEST COMPILATION BOX SET, BARBARA BOXER MEANDERS  THROUGH EPISODES OF THE DAILY SHOW LIKE ONE OF YOUR MOM'S FRIENDS. (LAUGHTER) THIS SET HAS GOT ALL YOUR DAILY SHOW FAVORITES. IT'S GOT I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THAT JOHN KERRY SPEAKS SLOWLY. WE MUSED LOOK. BUT JOHN OLIVER, THAT'S ABSURD. AND OF COURSE NEWT GINGRICH GETS MARRIED A LOT.
HAVING JUST WATCHED A VIDEO CLIP, JON MAKES A FUNNY FACE AND BANGS ON HIS  DESK, YOU KNOW, AT WHICH POINT HE THEN EXPLAINS IN A VERY EXASPERATED MANNER, ARE YOU-- KIDDING ME.
Jon: BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. IF YOU ACT NOW, WILL YOU ALSO GET SOME LEGENDARY DAILY SHOW MOMENTS INCLUDING  OUR ALL TIME CLASSIC DONALD TRUMP EATS PIZZA WITH A FORK.
DONALD TRUMP CONSUMES THE DAILY WHEEL OF SAUSAGE CHEESE BUT GET THIS HE USES  A YOU TENSE IL RATHER THAN JUST HIS HANDS. WELL, JON IS NOT LETTING HIM GET AWAY WITH THAT. HE THEN PROCEEDS TO DEMONSTRATE THE PROPER METHOD FOR INGESTING THE SAVORY NEW YORK STAPLE, USING AN ITALIAN ACCENT, DESPITE THE FACT THAT ALL GENEALOGICAL RECORDS REVEAL HIM TO BE OF EASTERN  EUROPEAN JEWISH ANCEST REE. IT'S TERRIFIC.
Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT, HOPEFULLY BARBARA BOXER WILL NO LONGER DO MY JOKES ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND SHE  WON'T GET A CHANCE TO DO-- SHE'S TALKING ABOUT ME IN REALTIME NOW. WE'
