MAY 3rd, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW  WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: SAY, HELL WOMAN TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GREAT SHOW, PETER BERGEN, AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK MANHUNT. I KNOW BHAU ARE THINKING, ARE YOU JUST SAYING THAT SO YOU CAN SAY ABBOTTABAD, I KNOW. I'M SURE IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION. LEV LAUGH.
Jon: AS YOU KNOW OSAMA BIN LADEN HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE NEWS THIS BEING THE  ONIER AN VERSE AR OF HIS PASSING.
GOOD MORNING, WE ARE GETTING A BRAND-NEW LOOK INTO THE MIND OF OSAMA BIN LADEN. PARTS OF BIN LADEN'S PERSONAL LETTERS NABBED FROM HIS COMPOUND IN PAKISTAN BY  NAVY SEALS HAVE JUST BEEN RELEASED.
Jon: WHOOO! PERSONAL LETTERS. OF BIN LADEN. DEAR WIFE NUMBER 7. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW IS SON NUMBER 19? I MISS YOU. TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE WEARING? OVER YOUR FACE. LAUGH LAUGH COME ON, THE GUY WAS RUN ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST FEERDZ TERRORIST NETWORK. I CAN'T IMAGINE HE HAD A LOT OF TIME TO KEEP UP WITH CORRESPONDENT.
NBC NEWS HAS BEEN TOLD BY SENIOR OFFICIALS THAT THERE WERE AS MANY AS 15,000  DISTINCT INDIVIDUAL DOCUMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN FROM THAT COMPOUND WHEN BIN LADEN WAS KILLED BY NAVY SEALS.
Jon: 15,000, THE GUY WASN'T A TERRORIST, HE WAS A HOARDER, OH MY GOD. WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO KIM THIS GUY. IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL WE LEARNED HE DIED ALONE SURROUND BY 29 CATS. TWO DECADES WORTH OF JC PENNEY CATALOGS. ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT DID WE GET, WHAT NEFARIOUS SCHEMES DID THE TERRORIST MASTER  MIND HAVE UP HIS SLEEVE.
WHAT IT SHOWS AGAIN IS THAT WHEN BILL LADEN WAS STILL INTENT ON ATTACKING  AMERICAN TARGETS, HE EVEN ASKED TO COME FOR HIS LIEU TEN ANTS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO A SASS FATE  PRESIDENT OBAMA.
Jon: NICE WORK GETTING TO THAT IN A TIMELY FASHION. SLOW BI WAN KENOBI. WHAT WAS THE TITLE OF THAT PLAN'S MEMO, BIN LADEN DETERMINED TO ATTACK, WHAT  IS THAT SOUND, SOUNDS LIKE A HELL KORPT S THAT FOOT STEP,OUT MY EYE. SO OBVIOUSLY THAT PLAN NEVER CAME TO FRUITION, ANYTHING MORE DOABLE ON HIS AGENDA.
HE TALKS SO MUCH ABOUT THE BIN LADEN BRAND AT AT ONE POINT EVEN WANTED TO  CHANGE THE NAME OF AL QAEDA.
Jon: WOW, I CAN SEE HOW WE NO LONGER WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT, INNOCENT  DEATHS AND HOW THAT COULD HAVE AFFECTED AL QAEDA FROM A BRANDING PERSPECTIVE.
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WITH THE TIMES. HOW ABOUT THIS INSTEAD OF AL QAEDA, AQ, YOU KNOW, MAYBE JUST A DIFFERENT NAME  COMPLETELY LIKE AL-TRIA OR SOMETHING ALREADY ASSOCIATED WITH SOMETHING POSITIVE, AL-ROKER, HE'S LOVABLE. OR, OR YOU COULD STOP WITH THE KILLING. HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO IT HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO IT. BUT OF COURSE CHALLENGING STILL AWAIT. WE TURN OUR ATTENTION TO OUR CURRENT DEBT HOLDERS AND FUTURE OVERLORDS, CHINA.
HILLARY CLINTON IS IN CHINA NEGOTIATING SENSITIVE ISSUES FROM IRAN TO NORTH  KOREA, ALL GOING PRETTY WELL UNTIL.
CHINA'S BEST KNOWN DISDIDN'TS HAS MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM HOUSE ARREST. SAID HE IS BEING HID INSIDE THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BEIJING.
CHEN'S DASH FOR FREEDOM COULDN'T COME AT A MORE AGO WAURD TIME FOR THE U.S..
Jon: WAY TO GO, CHEN! I MEAN HOW INCONSIDERATE CAN YOU GET! BLIND HUMAN ACTIVIST CHEN GUANGCHENG. COULDN'T WAIT JUST TWO MORE WEEKS TO ESCAPE OPPRESSION. TRY THINKING ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE FOR A CHANGE. JAILED WORKING TO END CHINA'S FORCED ABORTION AND STERILIZATION POLICIES GUY. SO WHAT. HE HAS-- YEAH, I KNEW YOU WOULD LIKE THAT. CHEN, HE HAS ESCAPED HIS STATE OPPRESSERS DURING A HIGH PROFILE U.S. DIPLOMATIC TRIP. TO BIGGIE.
THERE IS A VERY PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENT FOR THE CHINESE REGIME. THIS IS AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE. THEY DON'T LIKE HAVING THEIR DIRTY LAUNDRY, AS THEY SEE T HUNG OUT FOR THE  INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO SEE.
Jon: MUST AVOID CHINESE LAUNDRY JOKE. (LAUGHTER) FIND STRENGTH IN INSPIRATIONAL BRACELET. (LAUGHTER) WWDRD WHAT WOULD DON RICKLES DO. (LAUGHTER) SO WHAT DOES CHEN WANT?
ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT CHEN HAS ASKED TO LEAVE ON THE SAME PLANE AS HILLARY CLINTON.
Jon: OH, THAT'S A LITTLE BIT FORWARD THERE FELLOW.
WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE ALSO TOLL HER IN BROKEN ENGLISH, I WOULD LIKE TO KISS YOU. (LAUGHTER) RZ I LOVE THIS GUY. MOM, REQUEST WE KEEP HIM? ALL THINGS LOOK PRETTY GOOD. THE U.S. LOOKS LIKE A BEACON OF FREEDOM. CHINA LOOKS SLICELY MORE PROGRESSIVE FOR LETTING CHEN GO AND WE ALL GET TO PRETEND  OUR I PHONES AREN'T MADE BY SLAVE LABOR. SO IT'S A WIN-WIN. JUST HOURS AFTER CHEN GUANGCHENG LEFT THE U.S. EMBASSY HE SAID THE U.S. BROKERED DEAL WAS NOT THE HUMANITARIAN VICTORY OT BAMA ADMINISTRATION PORTRAYED. IN FACT, TO NOW SUGGEST THE U.S. FAILED IT TO EFFECTIVELY PROTECT HIM AND HIS FAMILY.
DE FEAR FOR HIS LIFE THAT HE WAS ALSO SAYING HE FELT THE EMBASSY LET HIM DOWN. THAT THEY ALMOST FORCED HIM TO LEAVE [BLEEP].
Jon: I WISH THERE WAS AN APP TO UNHEAR THAT. FOR MORE WE ARE JOINED BY BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF JOHN OLVER, THANKS FOR JOINING US. (APPLAUSE) JOHN, IN THIS SITUATION, OBVIOUSLY SECRETARY OF STATE CLINTON REALLY HAS HER HANDS FULL OVER THERE.
OF COURSE SHE HAS, JON. AND WE ALL KNOWS WHO'S TO BLAME.
Jon: ACTUALLY, I DON'T.
SERIOUSLY? LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A HINT, JON. HE'S ABOUT YEAH HIGH, PLAYS THE SACKS, FEELS YOUR PAIN.
Jon: THE CRYPTKEEPER.
NO.
Jon: IS THAT YOUR BILL CLINTON IMPRESSION.
YES, IT'S MY BILL CLINTON IMPRESSION IT'S EXTREMELY GOOD, YOUR QUEEN ELIZABETH  IS BRILLIANT.
Jon: HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
THAT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING. USE THAT SOUND IN A SENTENCE.
Jon: HELLO YOU [BLEEP] WAD.
OKAY TLARX IS PRETTY GOOD, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
Jon: EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THIS IS BILL CLINTON'S FAULT?
HE SET THE BAR, JON. PERHAPS YOU RECALL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN HE FREED THOSE TWO JOURNALISTS BY  SINGLE-HANDEDLY PLUCKING THEM OUT OF NORTH KOREA.
Jon: I REMEMBER THAT, A DIPLOMATIC TRIUMPH.
NO THAT WAS A DANGEROUS DIPLOMATIC PRECEDENT. WORD GOT AROUND. IF ARE YOU BEING REPRESSED BY AN EVIL COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP JUST GET ON TV AND A CLINTON WILL  PERSONALLY FLY TO YOUR RESCUE. IF NOT BILL AND HIS JET, THEN HILLARY ON HER STATE DEPARTMENT PLANE. IF NOT HER, MAYBE CHELSEA AND A SINGLE ENGINE CESSNA. WORST CASE SCENARIO YOU GET ROGER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT, WELL YOU BE CAREFUL IN BEIJING. HOW ARE YOU GETTING OUT THERE.
WELL, HOPEFULLY WITH THE BEST CASE CLINTON SCENARIO GETTING PICKED UP IN THE  MOTHERSHIP, JON.
Jon: ARE YOU NOT GOING TO GET PICKED UP IN GEORGE CLINTON'S MOTHERSHIP.
OH REALLYING WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT, WE?
Jon: STOP IT! THERE'S NO WAY.
NO WAY, NO WAY.
THAT IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
GEORGE CLINTON.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I IN GEORGE'S MOTHERSHIP, BEAM US UP. ♪ WE 2K3W09 FUJ ♪ ♪ WE GOT THE FUNK ♪ ♪.
JON, I'LL SEE YOU IN A FEW MINUTES. THIS IS AWESOME ♪ ♪.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, MR. GEORGE CLINTON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
