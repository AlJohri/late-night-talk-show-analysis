JULY 16th, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEAD QUARTERS IN NEW YORK  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO  THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'RE BACK, BABY, TWO WEEKS. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE GREAT LOUIS C.K. WILL BE JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOUIS, CK OF COURSE--  (LAUGHTER) LOUIS CALVIN KLEIN. (LAUGHTER) CHANGED HAD FOR SHOW BUSINESS. LOOK, I CAN'T GIVE YOU A RECAP OF ALL THE [BLEEP] THAT HAPPENED, OVER THE PAST, EVERY MAJOR STORY. BUT I CAN TELL YOU-- IN WHAT CAN ONLY BE CALLED A BIT OF DEVEIN INTERVENTION, THE HOT  POLITICAL MOMENT OF MITT ROMNEY VENTURE CAPITAL WHICH HAPPENED TO BEAR THE SAME  FAME AS THE POST FRIGHTENING AND CURRENT BATMAN VILLAIN. (LAUGHTER) IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2012 THANK YOU JESUS EDITION. (LAUGHTER) BAIN! NOT SINCE AID-- DIET CANDY SUFFERED THROUGH THEIR SOMEWHAT ILL TIMED 19880  LOSE WEIGHT WITH AIDS SALES CAMPAIGN HAS A BRAND FACED SUCH CHALLENGES. BAIN!
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, MY FRIEND. (LAUGHTER) NOW ROMNEY'S BAIN SEEN HERE WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN AD FOR AN ODDLY LUKE CAT  CAT-- LUCRATIVE ALL CLOTHED MALE STRIP REVIEW, THEY CALLED HIM MAGIC MIKE, SEE  MITT ROMNEY TOLD HIM IT IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT HE HAS RUN A BUSINESS SO HE  KNOWS HOW TO CREATE JOBS. ONE PROBLEM. WHEN MITT ROMNEY WAS C.E.O. OF BAIN CAPITAL IN THE '90s, BAIN INVESTED IN A SERIES OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING CALL CENTERS AN MANUFACTURERS  THAT EXPANDED OVERSEAS, SOMETIMES AT THE EXPENSE OF AMERICAN WORKERS.
Jon: HE NEVER SAID HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS GOING CREATE THOSE JOBS. THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD FOR MITT ROMNEY. LUCKILY, HE'S GOT A BIT OF --
ROMNEY SAYS HE TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM BAIN CAPITAL IN FEBRUARY OF 1999  TO RUN THE SALT LAKE OLYMPICS WHICH MEANS HE NEVER HAD CONTROL OF THE COMPANY'S DOING THE OUTSOURCING.
AH. HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OUTSOURCING BECAUSE AT THE TIME HE WAS TOO BUSY  BRINGING FOREIGNERS TO AMERICA TO TAKE OUR GOLD. (LAUGHTER) ONE SMALL PROBLEM WITH ROMNEY'S EXPLANATION. BETWEEN 1999 AND 2002 BAIN SEC FILING STATED ROMNEY WAS THE CHEF EXIVE OFFICER, PRESIDENT MANAGING DIRECTOR AND PAID AT LEAST $100,000 A YEAR. MITT.
THE DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OWNERSHIP WHICH IS THAT I  OWN SHARES AT BAIN BUT I DID TO THE MANAGE BAIN, WHEN YOU LEAVE AN ENTERPRISE AND YOU  HAVE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE MANAGING THE ENTERPRISE, WHO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL  THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS, WHO DECIDE WHOSE'S GOING TO GET HIRED AND FIRED, WHO DECIDE COMPENSATION  DECISIONS, THEY'RE THE MANAGERS. THEY'RE THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE BUSINESS.
Jon: I WAS JUST-- WITH THE SMOKE SCREENISH YET STILL LEGAL TITLE OF C.E.O. AND MANAGING DIRECTOR WHO WAS PAID AT LEAST $100,000 A YEAR TO DO WHAT ACCORDING TO  ME, MITT ROMNEY, WAS NOTHING. THAT'S THE KIND OF CAP AND SPEND BUSINESS EXPERIENCE I HOPE TO BRING TO THE WHITE HOUSE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHAT! WHAT! WHAT. CAN A BROTHER GET A SURROGATE UP IN THIS BITCH.
HE TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND HE ENDED UP TO THE GOING BACK AT ALL. AND RETIRED RETROACTIVELY TO FEBRUARY OF 1999 AS A RESULT.
Jon: RETIRED RETROACTIVELY. SEE N 2012 I REALIZED THE COMPANY I WAS LEGALLY C.E.O. OF IN 1999 DID THINK IT WAS HURT MY PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN THE PRESENT SO I  RETROACTIVELY WASN'T THERE. (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT SAYING THAT IF YOU HAVE A TIME MACHINE YOU NECESSARILY HAVE TO KILL HITLER. BUT THIS RETROACTIVE RETIREMENT IS THE WORST USE OF A TIME MACHINE I HAVE EVER SEEN. ROMNEY'S WEEK WASN'T ONLY ABOUT WHY NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW WHEN TO THROW HIS BAIN  RETIREMENT PARTY. THERE IS ALSO THE ISSUE OF HIS OFFSHORE INVESTMENTS AND AND-- EXPLAIN THAT.
I DON'T MANAGE THE MONEY THAT I HAVE. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHILE I WAS  GOVERNOR, OR WHILE I WAS CONSIDERING A RUN FOR NATIONAL OFFICE, I HAD A BLIND TRUST ESTABLISHED.
Jon: OH. SO-TO-AVOID A CONFLICT OF INTEREST MATTERED SO MUCH TO MITT ROMNEY HE ACTUALLY  BLINDED THE MAN RUNNING HIS MONEY. THAT'S--  (LAUGHTER) I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MANAGE MY MONEY. OH, AND ONE MORE THING-- BOOP. ALL RIGHT SO, ROMNEY'S MONEY WAS IN A BLIND TRUST. I GUESS THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD EXCUSE. UNLESS A BLIND TRUST IS A RUSE.
THE BLIND TRUST IS AN AGE-OLD RUSE, IF YOU WILL, WHICH IS TO SAY YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL A BLIND TRUST WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT DO. YOU GIVE A BLIND TRUST RULES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. TO THE TIME MACHINE! TO RETROACTIVELY RETIRE THAT SOUND BITE. SO MITT ROMNEY IS RUNNING ON HIS BUSINESS AND FINANCE ACUMEN BUT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE  MANAGEMENT OF EITHER HIS BUSINESS OR FINANCES. YOU KNOW HOW COCLEAR A LOT OF THIS CONFUSION UP. A QUICK LOOK AT ROMNEY'S TAX RETURNS FROM THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS.
I HAVE ALREADY PUT OUT ONE YEAR OF TAX RETURNS. WE'LL PUT OUT THE NEXT YEAR OF TAX RETURNS AS SOON AS THE ACCOUNTANTS HAVE THAT READY. THOSE ARE THE TWOIERS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE, THAT'S ALL THAT'S NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT MY FINANCES.
Jon: YES-- ABOUT JUST THE TWO YEARS WHEN YOU KNEW YOU WERE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. NOBODY GIVES A [BLEEP] ABOUT THOSE TWO YEARS. IT WOULD BE LIKE IF THE KEITH RICHARDS AUTOBIOGRAPHY WAS CALLED MY YEARS AS A MOVIE PIRATE. (APPLAUSE) NOBODY CARES. NOW LOOK, IF ALL THIS  [BLEEP] IS BEING-- ROMNEY ALWAYS HAS A AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI.
I PAY THE TAXES LEGALLY REQUIRED AND IN THE A DOLLAR MORE. IF THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE TAX WE LIKE ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY WILL  FOLLOW THAT OPPORTUNITY.
WE'VE COMPLIED WITH THE LAW. THE LAW REQUIRES TO US PUT OUT A FULL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. THAT I'VE DONE.
Jon: IF YOU ARE SO-CALLED JOB CREATOR IN THE COUNTRY, EVEN IF THE JOBS YOU CREATE ARE IN INDIA OR CHINA, YOU ARE LEGALLY ENTITLED TO  WONDERFUL THINGS LIKE OFFSHORE TAX ACCOUNTS AND CARRY INTEREST TAX RATES  THAT ARE LESS THAN HALF THE RATE FOR NORMAL INCOMES OR $77,000 IN BUSINESS DEDUCTIONS FOR DRESSAGE  HORSE COMPETITION EXPENSES. YEAH, $77,000 TAX WRITE-OFF TO SEND YOUR HORSE TO THE  [BLEEP] PROM. HERE'S WHAT HE DOESN'T GET. (APPLAUSE) HERE'S WHAT ROMNEY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. NOBODY CARES THAT MITT ROMNEY IS RICH. IT'S ROMNEY'S INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE INSTITUTIONAL ADVANTAGE THAT HE GAINS FROM  THE GOVERNMENT'S TAX CODE LARGESSE, THAT'S A LITTLE OFFENSIVE TO PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ROMNEY'S VIEW ON ANYONE ELSE WHO LOOKS TO THE GOVERNMENT  FOR THINGS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, FOOD AND MEDICINE.
ROMNEY SAYS THE FOLLOWING, YOU REMIND HIM OF THIS. IF THEY WANT MORE STUFF FROM THE GOVERNMENT, TELL THEM TO GO VOTE FOR THE OTHER GUY. MORE FREE STUFF. DON'T FORGET, NOTHING IS REALLY FREE. IT HAS TO BE PAID FOR BY PEOPLE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
Jon: AND HORSE PROM BLACK TIE, MOTHER [BLEEP]. WE'LL BE RIGHT
