FEBRUARY 16th, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. ANOTHER FINE ONE HERE AT THE DAILY SHOW, OUR GUEST ARNE DUNCAN OR ARNE, I BELIEVE  ARNE, YOU MAY BELIEVE ARNE. HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE NO TEST BEING THE DIFFERENCE BUT WE'LL SEE. HE'S THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, IMAGINE HOW BAD YOU WOULD HAVE TO MISBEHAVE  IN CLASS TO GET CALLED DOWN TO HIS OFFICE. I MEAN THAT, JIMMY F YOU DON'T QUIET DOWN I'M PUTTING YOU ON AN AIRPLANE TO WASHINGTON. BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES IN OUR ONGOING  COVERAGE, WHAT IS UP WITH THE PRESIDENT? WHAT'S UP WITH HIS RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GOING HOLLYWOOD. HE'S RAISING BIG MONEY IN L.A. RIGHT NOW.
THOSE SHELLING OUT BETWEEN 250 TO 500 TO OFFEND THEY WILL BE TREATED TO A  FOO FIGHTERS CONCERT. THE 80 PEOPLE WHO STAYED FOR DINNER AFTER THE FUND-RAISER, THEY ARE RICH. THEY WILL PAY $35,000.
Jon: $35,000-- WHAT? THAT IS OUTRAGE US, $35,000 FOR A TICKET TO DINNER BUT ONLY $250 TO SEE THE FOO FIGHTERS? THAT IS AN INSULT TO THIS FINE MAN DAVID GROHL WHO SPENT LAST 15 YEARS OF HIS  LIFE TENACIOUSLY FIGHTING FOO. (LAUGHTER) AND WINNING. THESE STREETS USED TO BE FILLED WITH FOO. AND NOW I PITY THE FOO. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, HATE IS GOING TO HATE. (LAUGHTER)
OCCUPY PROTESTORS WHO GATHERED NEAR THE PRESIDENT'S HOTEL SAY HE'S  CATERING TO THE 1% TO TRY AND GET RE-ELECTED.
GET OUT OF THESE FUND-RAISERS AND GET BACK TO THE STREETS. REMEMBER WHERE YOU CAME FROM.
Jon: I CAN'T HEAR YOU, I WAS IN A FOO FIGHTERS CONCERT. AND THEN I ATE A PORK CHOP THAT COST THE SAME AS ELECTION, IT WAS A LITTLE DRY, BUT WHAT? SO WHILE THE PRESIDENT JETS AROUND WITH HIS CASH VACUUM OVER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE  THEY'RE STILL DUKING IT OUT AMONGST THEMSELVES. AND THE PRIMARY SEASON HAS NOW SHIFTED TO MICHIGAN WHICH YOU WOULD THINK WAB A  CAKE WALK FOR MITT ROMNEY. HE GREW UP THERE. HIS FATHER WAS GOVERNOR THERE. FOR GOD'S SAKES, HE'S NAMED FOR THE SHAPE OF MICHIGAN. THE MITT. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, MUCH LUCKIER THAN HIS FLORIDA-BORN BROTHER WILLARD [BLEEP] ROMNEY. OBVIOUSLY A [BLEEP] FAMILY NICKNAME. SECRETARY OF EDUCATION ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER) THERE'S GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING ONE. HOW DO YOU LIKE THE [BLEEP] JOKE. OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE PROBLEM. ROMNEY MAY FACE IN MICHIGAN.
IN 2008 ROMNEY WROTE IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" LET DETROIT GO BANKRUPT.
Jon: SUBTITLED SERIOUSLY, DETROIT CAN [BLEEP]. LUCKILY, I REALLY HOPE THE TV IN THE GREEN ROOM IS OFF. LUCKILY MITT ROMNEY HAS UNLEASHED A BRILLIANT NEW AD CAMPAIGN TO MAKE MICHIGAN  VOTERS FORGET THAT ENTIRE ARTICLE.
I GREW UP IN MICHIGAN. IT WAS EXCITING TO BE HERE. I REMEMBER GOING TO THE DETROIT AUTO SHOW WITH MY DAD. THAT WAS A BIG DEAL. PEOPLE HERE IN DETROIT ARE DISTRESSED. I WANT TO MAKE MICHIGAN STRONGER AND BETTER. MICHIGAN'S BEEN MY HOME AND THIS IS PERSONAL.
Jon: WOW, WHAT A-- POWERFUL AND EMOTIONAL WAY TO CONNECT TO YOUR HOME TOWN. I-- OF COURSE LIKE ALL THINGS ROMNEY THERE ARE SOME CAVIARS, I'M SORRY, CAVEATS. AS IT TURNS OUT, THAT PHOTO IN THE AD OF ROMNEY AND HIS DAD AT THE DETROIT AUTO SHOW  IS ACTUALLY HIM AND HIS DAD AT THE 1964 NEW YORK WORLD FAIR. WHICH APPARENTLY IN ROMNEY'S MIND TOOK PLACE IN QUEENS'S MICHIGAN, AND THE AMERICAN  CAR HE IS DRIVING AROUND IS A CHRYSLER 300 WHICH IS MANUFACTURED IN CANADA. SO AND YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED HE WASN'T ACTUALLY DRIVING, HE WAS IN FACT  HIMSELF BEING DRIVEN. ALL RIGHT, SO--  (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT ROMNEY'S WEAKNESS. IT'S ALSO ABOUT HIS OPPONENT RICK SANTORUM'S STRENGTH. HE'S A SERIOUS CONTENDER NOW. AND AS WE OURSELVES RECOGNIZE TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN I ANNOUNCED ON THIS PROGRAM WE WOULD NO LONGER  BE MAKING JOKES ABOUT THE ALTERNATE MEANING OF SANTORUM'S NAME, YEAH, NO  MATTER HOW TEMPTING IT MAY BE.
RICK SANTORUM'S SURGE IS SPREADING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THIS MUST COVER SANTORUM AS A SERIOUS CANDIDATE, NOT AS A NAME SAKE FOR STAINING ANAL LIQUIDES. OKAY, PERHAPS WE CAN DISTRACT OURSELVES WITH SANTORUM'S LATEST ANTI-ROMNEY CAMPAIGN AD.
THIS TIME ROMNEY'S FIRING HIS MARK AT RICK SANTORUM, AND A STAGGERING $20 MILLION SUPPOSEDLY ATTACK SEVERAL REPUBLICANS. AND IN THE END, MITT ROMNEY'S UGLY ATTACKS ARE GOING TO BACKFIRE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO MITT ROMNEY ATTACKS SANTORUM AND ENDS UP WITH BROWN LIQUID ON HIS SHIRT. THIS IS ENTRAPMENT! ALL RIGHT. ACTUALLY THE WHOLE SECOND MEANING OF SANTORUM THING WAS STARTED AS A PROTEST OF  THE SENATOR'S VIEWS ON GAY MARRIAGE. BUT LATELY, ACTIVISTS HAVE TAKEN AN EVEN MORE SUBTLE APPROACH TO THAT ISSUE.
RICK SANTORUM'S TRIP TO WASHINGTON STATE LAST NIGHT WASN'T ALL SMOOTH SAILING.
IT'S CALLED GLITTER BOMBING.
PROTESTORS CRASHED THE EVENT AND HE FELL VICTIM TO ANOTHER GLITTER BOMB.
Jon: NO WORD WHETHER THIS WAS DETONATED REMOTELY OR THE WORK OF A SUICIDE GLITTER BOMBER. (LAUGHTER) THE GLITTER BOMB HAS EMERGED AS A WEAPON OF CHOICE FOR GAY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS LOOKING  FOR A FORM OF PROTEST THAT'S MORE CLEVER THAN A PIE IN THE FACE, BUT LESS CLEVER  THAN SOMETHING ACTUALLY CLEVER. (LAUGHTER) YEAH, YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE COMING, DID YOU? ALMOST ALL THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN HIT. INCLUDING MITT ROMNEY, NEWT GINGRICH AND MICHELEBACK MANN, BLIRT-- GLITTER  BOMBING IS SUCH A CONCERN THE SECRET SERVICE USED SPECIALLY TRAINED GLITTER BOMB SNIFFING DOGS. (LAUGHTER) IF NOTHING ELSE THESE INCIDENTS GIVE VOTERS A CHANCE TO SEE HOW CANDIDATES  HANDLE THEMSELVES UNDER FIRE. MAY FAVORITE RESPONSE HAS TO BE MITT ROMNEY'S.
OH, I'VE GOT GLITTER IN MY HAIR. THAT'S NOT ALL THAT IS IN MY HAIR, I'LL TELL YOU THAT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE, ANYBODY SEEN SOMETHING ABOUT MARY? SERIOUSLY, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF STUFF IN MY HAIR. ANYWAY. STILL, I DO HAVE TO HAND IT TO THE GAY ACTIVISTS WHO CARRY OUT THESE GLITTER BOMBINGS. REALLY TERRIFIC WAY TO WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR SIDE. IT'S A CLEAR UNEQUIVOCAL STATEMENT. WE ARE DESERVING OF DIGNITY, RESPECT, AND EQUAL RIGHTS. AND UNTIL WE GET IT, WE WILL ACT LIKE PET LENT CHILDREN. -- PETULANT CHILDREN. WE'LL BE RIGHT
