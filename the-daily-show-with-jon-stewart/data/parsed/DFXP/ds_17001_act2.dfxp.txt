(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. REMEMBER OUR BORDER? YOU KNOW, THE ONE WITH THE CRISIS ON IT? IT TURNS OUT OUT IT HAS A WHOLE NEW CRISIS, A CRISIS SO BAD WE SENT JASON JONES TO  MEXICO TO TRY AND FIX IT.
MEXICANS, FOR YEARS THEY'VE SNUCK ACROSS OUR BORDERS TO STEAL OUR JOBS, DRAIN OUR  SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND HAVE ANCHOR BABIES. BUT FINALLY SOME GOOD NEWS. NEWLY RELEASEDED NUMBERS SHOW ABOUT 300,000 ILLEGALS HAVE GONE BACK TO MEXICO.
EXPERTS SAY THE WEAKER U.S. ECONOMY ALONG WITH RISING DEPORTATIONS, TOUGHER BORDER ENFORCEMENT MEANS FEWER ILLEGAL ALIENS.
Reporter: VICTORY. BUT SOME LIKE GEORGIA BLACK BERRY FARMER GARY REFUSED TO CELEBRATE.
I ONLY HAVE $200,000 WORTH OF BLACK BERRIES ROTTING IN THE FIELDS. THERE'S CONSIDERABLY LESS WORKERS AROUND.
Reporter: HARSH IMMIGRATION LAWS HAVE CONSEQUENCES. MEXICAN WORKERS MAY BE GONE BUT 500,000 UNEMPLOYED GEORGIANS ARE READY TO FILL THE VOID.
AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO DO THESE JOBS. WE'VE ADVERTISED IN THE LOCAL PAPER, THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUT THEY DON'T COME.
Reporter: NO WHITE PEOPLE.
NO WHITE PEOPLE.
Reporter: WHAT ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE?
A FEW BLACK PEOPLE BUT NOT A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE. WE NEED TO GET THE HISPANICS TO COME BACK.
Reporter: WHAT CAN WE DO AS AVERAGE CITIZENS TO GET THEM BACK?
THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO SAY TO ANYBODY IN MEXICO IS GEORGIA AT ITS WORST IS BETTER  THAN MEXICO AT ITS BEST.
Reporter: WITH THAT APPEALING MESSAGE FOR MEXICANS I HEADED SOUTH OF THE BORDER  TO RECRUIT AMERICA'S NEXT GREAT BLACK BERRY PICKERS. BERRIES. WE GOT 'EM. THEY NEED PICKIN'. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I'D RATHER BE A PROFESSIONAL HERE IN MEXICO THAN BE IN A GARDEN IN THE UNITED STATES.
Reporter: WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING IN THE GARDEN IN THE UNITED STATES?
JUST BEING IN THE SUN THE WHOLE DAY AND SWEATING.
Reporter: SERIOUSLY. OUR CROPS ARE LITERALLY ROTTING. WE NEED YOU GUYS.
YOU CAN'T HAVE US.
Reporter: I GET IT. YOU GUYS ARE ENTITLED COLLEGE KIDS. YOU WANT THE WHOLE CORPORATE U.S. SALES PITCH THING. ALL RIGHT. I'M COMMITTED. LET'S GO.
ARE Y'ALL READY FOR THIS?
ON YOUR FEET NOW. COME ON! ARE YOU MEXICANS? BOOM! BERRIES. WE GOT 'EM. WE NEED YOU TO PICK 'EM. THIS GENERATION WAS LOST BUT WITH MY COUNTRY IN NEED I HAD TO TAKE MY MESSAGE TO THE  STREETS AND GET OUR MEXICANS BACK. PEOPLE OF MEXICO, I COME FROM AMERICA WITH A MESSAGE. WE'RE SORRY. WE'RE REALLY REALLY SORRY. DON'T YOU WANT YOUR DADDY TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES AND PICK FRUIT FOR ME? WE'RE SORRY FOR ARIZONA AND THE TACO BELL DOG. THAT WAS REALLY RACIST. I KNOW. HEY, YOU LOOK LIKE A BERRY PICKER. YOU NEED A LADDER TO GET IN THE STATES. WE'RE SORRY GOOD GEORGE LOPEZ. HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN CANCELED. HE WAS FUNNY-ISH. ARE ALL FRUITS THAT YOU CAN PICK IN AMERICA IF YOU COME WITH ME. THE MORE TIME I SPENT HERE, THE MORE I SAW THAT MAYBE MEXICO WAS THE NEW LAND OF OPPORTUNITY. A PLACE WHERE THE FIFTH MOST POPULAR CORRESPONDENT ON A BASIC CABLE COMEDY SHOW COULD  MAKE A NEW LIFE. WHAT HOPE DID AN UNDOCUMENTED AMERICANO HAVE? PERHAPS I CAN FIND A JOB THAT MEXICANS FOUND TOO DEMEANING TO DO THEMSELVES.
JASON JONES. (SPEAKING SPANISH).
YEAH!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Reporter: FINALLY, I WAS HOME.
Jon: JASON JONES.
