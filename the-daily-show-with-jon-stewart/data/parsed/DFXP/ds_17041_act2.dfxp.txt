Jon: WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW LOOK, I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING VERY CLEAR. WE HERE AT THE SHOW WE RAG ON CNN A LOT MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE -- THEATERIBLE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE TENDED TO FOCUS ON THE HOURS BETWEEN 7:00 A.M. AND 10:00 P.M. WHICH GIVES US REALLY  MORE MATERIAL THAN WE CAN HANDLE. DID YOU KNOW CNN HAS A SHOW ON AT 5:00 A.M. IT'S CALLED EARLY START AND THEY ARE NOT AFRAID TO STRETCH THE BOUNDS OF WHAT A NEWS SHOW CAN DO.
ON THIS PROGRAM AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND TRY OUT CRAZY IDEAS  ESSENTIALLY WE'RE GOING TO WAKE SOME POOR SOUL UP, SOMEBODY REALLY CONNECTED TO THE NEWS AND  HAS NO IDEA. WE'RE EXERCISING OUR ROLODENES. DROLODEXES.
Jon: THE IDEA IS TO CALL SOMEONE YOU HAVEN'T ASKED. WHAT COULD GO WRONG.
TODAY'S IS TERRY KENNEDY. I HOPE SHE'S AWAKE. [PHONE RINGING]
THIS IS GETTING EMBARRASSING.
Jon: GETTING EMBARRASSING, YOU DON'T COLD CALL A KENNEDY AT AK IN THE MORNING. DO YOU HOW MANY UNEXPECTED TRAGEDIES THIS FAMILY HAS SUFFERED SNL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU  KNOW THIS BUT KENNEDYS ALMOST NEVER GET GOOD NEWS FROM CNN AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING. BUT WHATEVER IT'S ALREADY RINGING.
SHE'S GOING TO ANSWER. I'M SURE SHELL. COME ON, KERRY.
HELLO?
HI IS KERRY THERE?
THIS IS ME.
HI, KERRY IT'S ASHLEIGH BANFIELD CALLING.
GOOD MORNING.
YOU ARE ON THE AIR SO NO F BOMBS. HOW ARE YOU? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HOW AM I? I'M GETTING READY TO SAY (bleep) REAL LOUD. HOW AM I? 308 SECONDS AGO I WAS RIDING THE DINOSAUR NAKED THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL AND NOW I'M ON THE PHONE  WITH YOU. THAT'S HOW (bleep) I AM. DO THE INTERVIEW.
WE'VE SEEN BEAUTIFUL PICTURES OF YOUR FATHER. YOU WERE EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS KILLED? DO YOU STILL HAVE HAUNTING MEMORIES OF EVERY CAMPAIGN?
Jon: ASH -- I LIKE YOU. I GET IT YOU WANT TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS AND HAVE FUN AND HAVE HARD NEWS. KERRY KENNEDY COLD CALL. YOU WERE EIGHT WHEN THEY SHOT YOUR DAD. ANY MEMORIES YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH US? ANSWER RIGHT NOW AND WIN TWO TICKETS TO AEROSMITH. THIS WILL IS CNN. YOU ARE GOING TO DO A BIT LIKE THAT YOU HAVE TO PICK A LANE. YOU KNOW WHAT? --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TRY THE BIT AGAIN. TRY IT AGAIN.
HE'S A COMEAN, TV PERSONALITY. WE'LL DIE ALING HIM -- DIALING HIM UP TO SEE HOW HE IS IN THE MORNING.
Jon: CHUCK A COMEDIAN. IT'S A FAMILY ASSASSINATION FREE GUEST. NOTHING IS GOING TO GO WRONG HERE.
HELLO?

HELLO.
CHUCK THIS IS THE F.B.I. CALLING.
NO.
THIS IS SOMEBODY ELSE.

Jon: BAD ENOUGH TO WRONG NUMBER SOME POOR SCHMUCK AT 5 (bleep) IN THE MORNING THEN  TELL HIM YOU WERE THE F.B.I. YOU KNOW WHERE HE WAS HALF HOUR AFTER HANGING UP, GOING DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE. THIS IS HIM NOW. CNN WHY DON'T YOU STICK TO WHAT YOU DO BEST? AND AS SOON AS WE FIGURE THAT OUT WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
