DECEMBER 15TH, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT, ONE MATTHEW DAMON WILL BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT, A  WELL-KNOWN ACTOR. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: FIRST LET'S BEGIN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH INDECISION 2012, THE GREAT  WHITE HOPE. AS YOU KNOW, REPUBLICANS ARE WORKING OVERTIME TO KEEP THEMSELVES FROM HAVING TO  SPEND NEXT FALL WITH A MITT ROMNEY SIGN ON THEIR LAWN. THEY'LL DO ANYTHING TO AVOID THAT HONEY, THEY STOLE OUR ROMNEY SIGN. NO, THAT WAS ME, I JUST PUT IT AWAY. (LAUGHTER) VOTERS HAVE TEST-DRIVEN EVERYBODY FROM BACHMANN TO PERRY IN INCREASED DESPERATION. OVER THE FIRST VOTE FINALLY IN SIGHT, IT APPEARS THAT THE RIDE MAY HAVE ARRIVED. THE FORM OF A WHITE 1994 CHEVY CAPRICIOUS.
WE ARE JUST WEEKS AWAY FROM THE IOWA CAUCUSES AND NEWT GINGRICH HAS RISEN TO THE TOP.
ACCORDING TO ONE NEW NATIONAL POLL, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" POLL PUTS  GINGRICH AHEAD BY 17%.
VERY HARD NOT TO LOOK AT THE RECENTLY POLLS AND THINK THAT THE ODDS ARE VERY HIGH  I'M GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WOW. YES, IT APPEARS THAT NEWT GINGRICH WILL BE THE NAH-MINY EVEN IF HE BELIEVES  IT RHYMES WITH HOW MANY INY. I WOULD SAY TONIGHT TO THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS, DON'T DO THIS. SERIOUSLY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I KNOW YOU'RE MAD. I KNOW YOU'RE MAD-- ER THAN USUAL. COUNTRY IS BEING RUN BY A FOR EARN-BORN HAWAIIAN. (LAUGHTER) -- BY A FOREIGN-BORN HAWAIIAN, RADICAL CHRISTIAN MUSLIM, SOCIALIST WHO IS IN  THE POCKET OF WALL STREET AND SOMETIMES NEWT GINGRICH CAN SOUND LIKE THE ANSWER.
WELL, I WOULD FOLLOW THE REAGAN PLAY BOOK. I'M AN IDEALIST, A RO MAM MAM-- ROMANTIC AND PERMANENT OPT TEST AND THAT IS THE  AMERICAN TRA DISMINGTS HOW CAN YOU HAVE JUDGEMENT IF YOU HAVE NO FAITH AND HOW I  CAN TRUST WITH YOU POWER IF YOU DON'T PRAY.
Jon: SO HERE'S THE THING, HE'S NOT-- HE'S MORE LIKE A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING OFINE RAND KICKING JIMMY  CARTER IN THE BALLS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: RIGHT IN THE FOUNTAIN HEADS. LISTEN, REAGAN HAD A CERTAIN CHARM AND GENTILITY. GINGRICH IS LIKE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF REAGAN HAD BEEN ABANDONED AS A CHILD AND  RAISED BY A FAMILY OF CACTUSES.
THERE IS A GAY AND SECULAR FASCISM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WANTS TO O  IMPOSE ITS WILL ON THE REST OF US.
THE SECULAR AGENDA CLEARLY IS AN AMERICAN FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN  AMERICA HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 400 YEARS.
ONE OF THE GREAT TRAGEDIES OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, --
THE MORE SUCCESSFUL THEY HAVE BEEN AT INTERCEPTING AND STOPPING BAD GUYS, THE  LESS PROOF THERE IS THAT WE'RE IN DANGER.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY SHOULD EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE ALLOW AN ATTACK TO GET  THROUGH TO REMIND US. THINK ABOUT THIS, THINK ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY.
Jon: YOU KNOW, THE CRAZIEST THING ABOUT THAT CLIP IS NOT EVEN GINGRICH  SUGGESTING THE OCCASIONAL TERRORIST ATTACK, WOULD BE A USEFUL REMINDER, A POST-IT  NOTE, IF YOU WILL, BUT THAT WHEN THE AUDIENCE ATTEMPTS TO LAUGH UNCOMFORTABLY AT  HIS COMMENT, HIS IMMEDIATE INSTINCT IS TO GO NO, NO, NO, NO-- [BLEEP] SERIOUS HERE. (LAUGHTER) I'M NUTS!
Jon: LOOK, REPUBLICANS, I KNOW YOU MISS THE INTOXICATING HIGH OF THE EARLY '80s. BUT LOOK IN THE MIRROR, MAN, LOOK WHERE CHASING THE REAGAN HAS LED YOU, TO THE BASEMENT OF A BROKEN DOWN A  BAN DAWNED DRUG DEN STUCK IN  [BLEEP] JUST TO SCORE A $5 ROCK. (LAUGHTER) METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING. (LAUGHTER) WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. AND IF YOU WON'T LISTEN TO ME, AND I KNOW THAT YOU WON'T BECAUSE I KNOW YOU  DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE FOR ME, FIND WHAT I DO SOMEWHAT CRASS AND MISLEADING, LISTEN  TO YOUR FRIENDS. THIS IS AN INTERVENTION. THAT'S WHY WE ARE ALL RIGHT NOW IN A SECAUCUS HAMPTON INN. EVERYONE IS HERE TODAY BECAUSE THEY LOVE YOU. TOM, WHY DON'T YOU START US OFF, TOM.
I'M NOT INCLINED TO BE A SUPPORTER OF NEWT GINGRICH'S  HAVING SERVED UNDER HIM FOR FOUR YEARS AND EXPERIENCED PERSONALLY HIS LEADERSHIP.
WHY IS THAT?
BECAUSE I FOUND IT LACKING. (LAUGHTER)
TOM COBURN, REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM PERHAPS THE MOST REPUBLICAN STATE IN THE  COUNTRY, OKLAHOMA. YOU CAN'T EVEN FIND PEOPLE WITH BLUE EYES IN OKLAHOMA. (LAUGHTER) COBURN IS SO CONSERVATIVE HE ONCE LODGED A PROTEST  AGAINST SHOWING "SCHINDLER'S LIST" ON TV BECAUSE OF THE NUDITY. THAT'S TRUE. YES. THE NUDITY. THAT'S WHAT STRIKES YOU AS OBSCENE IN "SCHINDLER'S LIST". WILL YOU LISTEN TO THIS GUY.
YOU KNOW, HE'S BEEN OUT OF GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG TIME. HE'S MATURED AS A PERSON. HE HAS REATTACHED HIMSELF TO FAITH.
Jon: WHAT? NO, LISTEN YOURSELF! FIRST OF ALL REATTACHED HIMSELF TO HIS FAITH, LIKE OH, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED  IS FAITH JUST LOST THE STICKUM, YOU HAVE TO LICK IT AND STICK UP THERE. THE ONLY FAITH GINGRICH HAS REATTACHED HIMSELF TO IS BEGINNINGISMISM-- GINGRICHISM, THE BELIEF IN THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE GINGRICH THIS IS HIM FROM LAST MONTH.
I AM MUCH LIKE REAGAN AND MARGARET THATCHER, I AM SUCH AN UNCONVENTIONAL POLITICAL  FIGURE THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO DESIGN A VERY UNIQUE CAMPAIGN THAT FITS THE WAY I  OPERATE AND WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO.
Jon: HEY, NEWT, DONALD TRUMP CALLED, HE WANTS HIS IRRATIONAL EGO BACK. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO BOOM, BA, BOOM.
Jon: WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE  AND CONVINCE THEM.
I DON'T THINK NEWT GINGRICH CARES ABOUT CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLESES. NEWT GINGRICH CARES ABOUT NEWT GINGRICH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE CAN BE CONSIDERED A CONSERVATIVE.
MOST OF US ARE TERRIFIED TO DPET THAT HE WOULD BECOME THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.
HE'S TOO ERRATIC.
I THINK HE DOES NOT HAVE THE DISCIPLINE, DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CONTROL  HIM EF IS-- HIMSELF. AND HE CAN'T STAY FOCUSED.
Jon: THAT'S WHO YOU ARE GOING TO NOMINATE FOR PRESIDENT. CAN'T CONTROL HIMSELF, CAN'T STAY FOCUSED, TOO ERRATIC. THOSE LAST DESCRIPTIONS ARE USUALLY FOLLOWED BY THE PHRASE, AND HE'S DISRUPTIVE  AT NAP TIME AND A BIT OF A BITER. DO YOU GET IT? (APPLAUSE) ARE YOU SEEING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? OKAY, I SEE SOMEONE ELSE WANTS TO SPEAK. YOU HAVE HAD YOUR HAND UP FOR A WHILE.
HE IS NOT A NICE HUMAN BEING. HE IS A BAD PERSON.
Jon: JOE, JOE, JOE, I THINK WE'VE ALREADY IDENTIFIED OUR NEGATIVE INVENTORIES. NOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR SCAFFOLDING, SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE, UP, A WAY OUT.
ES IS A TERRIBLE PERSON. HE-- HE DEHUMANIZES THE PEOPLE-- .
Jon: YES, YES, HE IS TERRIBLE. LOOK, WE GET T YOU [BLEEP] LOOK, GOP, I CAN'T MAKE YOU NOT CHOOSE NEWT GINGRICH AS THE STANDARD-BEARER OF YOUR  POLITICAL PARTY. BUT BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY DECISION, THERE IS-- THERE'S ONE MORE PERSON WHO WANTS TO  SAY SOMETHING, SOMEONE WHO IS LITERALLY COMING OUT OF HIDING JUST TO BE HERE TODAY. BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT. AND IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU'VE HIT ROCK BOTTOM YET, MAYBE WILL YOU NOW.
IS THERE ANY WAY HE COULD BE BEHIND GINGRICH.
HE SOME ONLY-- BECK COULD BE BEHIND GINGRICH.
HE IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT I CANNOT VOTE FOR.
Jon: GLENN BECK CANNOT SUPPORT NEWT GINGRICH! (APPLAUSE)
Jon: HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU NEED, WHAT YOU JUST SAW IS THE POLITICAL EQUIVALENT OF  WAKING UP IN A DUMPSTER WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S CAN DOM IN YOUR PANTS. -- CONDOM IN YOUR PANTS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WE'L
