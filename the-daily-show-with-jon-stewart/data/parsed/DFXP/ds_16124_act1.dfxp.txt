SEPTEMBER 29, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "NESN DAILY" SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT, THE GREAT, THE GREAT, THE LEGENDARY-- YOU CAN'T SAY THIS  ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE-- TONY BENNETT IS GOING TO BE JOINING US ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  TOP STORY TONIGHT, THOUGH, DEMOCRACY! ON THE LURCH. IT'S THE NEWS EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT. AMERICA'S GREAT ALLY AND FAVORITE ROMANTIC STROLL PARTNER, SAUDI ARABIA, IS  OLDING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONSH TODAY. TODAY. AND THE BIG NEWS FROM THE ELECTION, NO, NO, NOT THE SURPRISING STRENGTH OF THE  JEDDAH CITY COUNCIL ELECTIONS. (LAUGHTER) I TRIED TO SAY THAT RIGHT. IT'S THIS BOMBSHELL ANNOUNCEMENT.
THE SEISMIC SHIFT IN SAUDI ARABIA, KING ADBULLAH ANNOUNCED WOMEN WILL NOW BE ALLOWED TO  VOTE AND RUN FOR OFFICE.
Jon:  YES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOTHING SAYS DEMOCRACY LIKE A ROYAL DECREE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT STILL TODAY, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, SAUDI WOMEN, PARTICIPATING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.
THE KING SAID THAT WOMEN COULD PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.
IN THE NEXT MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN 2015.
Jon:  HEY, 2011, 2015. WHAT'S FOUR YEARS WHEN YOU'RE FINALLY GETTING A CHANCE TO VOTE.
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE WONDERING IF EXACTLY THAT MEANS THEY WOULD PRECISELY BE ABLE TO VOTE. HE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY THE WORD "VOTE." ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  STILL, UH, PARTICIPATION. WOMEN CAN PARTICIPATE. THERE ARE STILL GOING TO BE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SAUDI WOMEN TO HAND OUT FLYERS OR BE  THE VOTING BOOTH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, IN THE INTERIM, SAUDI ARABIAIAN WOMEN DO STILL FACE  SOME MINOR RESTRICTION.
THEY AREN'T ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ABROAD WITHOUT FIRST GETTING  PERMISSION FROM A MALE GUARDIAN.
WOMEN CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT A MALE SHAM ROPE.
CAN'T LEAVE THE WITHOUT WITHOUT BEING FULLY COVERED AND  ACCOMPANIED BY A MALE GUARDIAN.
Jon:  MUST GET WEIRD AT BACHELORETTE PARTIES. ( LAUGHTER ) CHAPERONES ARE PROBABLY SITTING THERE THE WHOLE TIME LIKE... CAN WE LEAVE YET? ALL RIGHT, SO THERE ARE SOME MINOR, SEEMINGLY ARCHAIC POLICIES TOWARDS WOMEN IN SAUDI ARABIA. LIKE OUR BLUE LAWS. THEY'RE ON THE BOOKES, SELDOM ENFORCED, NOD, NOD, WINK, WINK.
A SAUDI WOMAN SENTENCED TO 10 LASHES FOR DRIVING A CAR.
Jon:  THAT'S (BEEP) UP ( APPLAUSE ) WHY DO WE LET-- WHY DO WE LET  SAUDI ARABIA GET AWAY WITH THIS STUFF? HOW CAN WE PUT UP WITH THEM DENYING WOMEN BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND STILL CALL THEM-- WAIT A  MINUTE-- ALLIES AND ALL THAT. I JUST-- WHY CAN WE-- HOW CAN WE DID THAT AND STILL-- I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT WAS WEIRD. ALL RIGHT. OF COURSE, IT'S OVERSEAS. DEMOCRACY OVERSEAS CAN BE A LITTLE MESSY. IT'S NEW. HERE, AMERICA, THE CRADLE OF LIBERTY, WE'RE LONG PAST THOSE FITS AND STARTS. WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT HAPPENED? DID THOSE LADIES TRY AND DRIVE? WHAT? THAT'S HERE IN AMERICA? APPARENTLY, THAT FOOTAGE CAME FROM THE MARCH ON WALL STREET THIS PAST SATURDAY DURING AN  ONGOING DEMONSTRATION CALLED, ODDLY ENOUGH, OCCUPY WALL STREET.
THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, I GUESS THAT IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOK LOOK LIKEES, ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, IT'S WHAT BONARU LOOKS LIKE. WAIT A MINUTE, YOUNG, IDEALISTIC PROTESTERS, RHYTHMIC DRUMMING, THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF MEDIA ATTENTION. WHY, THAT'S THE MATING CALL OF THE GREEN-CAPPED MICHIGANIAN WARBLER. YES, LIKE A MOTH TO A FLAME. DIRECTOR CHAIR MICHAEL MOORE LET LAWRENCE O'DONNELL KNOW THIS PROTEST WASN'T ABOUT HIM.
THERE'S NO ONE PERSON THAT COMES IN HERE AND SAYS, "NOW, THIS IS OUR AGENDA AND THIS IS THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE." THERE ARE-- THERE ARE A VARIETY  OF DEMANDS, AND-- AND CONCERNS WITHIN THIS GROUP.
Jon:  SOME WANT TO REFORM THE SYSTEM OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE. SOME HAVE AN ISSUE WITH OUR POLICY TOWARDS ISRAEL. ONE GIRL OVER THERE IS DRESSED LIKE A ( BLEEP ) COIN. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT'S CAN ABOUT. I GUESS SHE'S TAKING ON SOME TYPE OF PRO OR ANTI-CHANGE POSITION. STILL, AGREE OR DISAGREE, OR NOT KNOW THE PROTESTERS' GOALS OR MESSAGE. ONE THING ALL PEOPLE CAN AGREE ON IS AT LEAST ONE REACTION TO THE MOVEMENT WAS UNACCEPTABLE.
VIDEO HAS SURFACED OF A POLICE OFFICER USING PEPPER SPRAY ON WOMEN DURING THAT  STANDOFF SATURDAY.
THERE WERE FIVE YOUNG WOMEN ON A SIDEWALK STANDING THERE WHO WERE CONTAINED IN A PEN, AN  ORANGE PLASTIC PEN, JUST OBSERVING THE PROTEST ON THE SIDEWALK.
THE POLICE COMMANDER USING PEPPER SPRAY AGAINST SOME YOUNG WOMEN.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, THAT LOOKS BAD. BUT MAYBE THAT COP HAD A GOOD REASON TO USE A BLINDING, STINGING CHEMICAL ON FIVE APPARENTLY ALREADY PENNED IN WOMEN AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE HIS  FELLOW OFFICERS WHO WERE SURROUNDING THEM. MAYBE THE PEPPER SPRAY WAS A MISTAKE. IT WAS A HOT DAY. MAYBE THAT OFFICER WAS REACHING FOR HIS CANISTER OF COOLING CUCUMBER MIST SPRAY ( LAUGHTER )  AND GRABBED THE PEPPER SPRAY BY ACCIDENT. I'M SURE IF WE JUST FILMED HIM LATER--
Jon:  ( BLEEP )! HE SPRAYED THE CAM RONOW! I'M STARTING TO THINK THIS GUY DOESN'T EVEN HAVE CUCUMBER MIST SPRAY ( LAUGHTER )  SO WHO EXACTLY WAS THIS HUMAN CROPDUSTER RAINING HABANERO MISERY ON THE CROWD?
WE NOW KNOW HIS NAME AND RANK. THE "NEW YORK TIMES" HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE OUT-OF-CONTROL OFFICER IS THE  HIGH-RANKING DEPUTY INSPECTOR ANTHONY BALOANIA. ( LAUGHTER ) COME ON ( APPLAUSE ). COME ON. ANTHONY BALOGNA. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT GUY'S NAME IS TONY BALONEY ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  YOU AND I KNOW. YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYBODY. TONY BALONEY. THE GUY'S NAME IS TONY BALONEY. FAVORITE PASTA, RIGATONI. FAVORITE ISLAND, CONEY. FIREFIGHTER ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER, BERLUSCONI. FAVORITE RESTAURANT, SHONEY'S. FAVORITE DESSERT, FRESHED MIXED BERRIES. YOU THOUGHT I'D SAY SPUMONI OR TORTONI. NO, HE'S LACTOSE INTOLARONI. THIS GIVES ME AN IDEA. THIS TONY BALONEY IS A TELEVISION SERIES WAITING TO HAPPEN ( LAUGHTER )  AND I'M ABOUT TO HAPPEN IT.
IN A CITY GONE MAD, TONY BALONEY WAS THE FINE MIST OF THE LAW. BUT THEN HE WENT TOO FAR.
YOU PEPPER SPRAYED FIVE LADIES IN THE FACE?
I GOT RESULTS.
YOU'RE A LOOSE NOZZLE, BALONEY. TURN IN YOUR BADGE. AND YOUR SPRAY CAN. ALL OF IT.
LUCKY FOR NEW YORK, BILINI DOESN'T NEED A BADGE.
IT'S BALONEY, CHIEF. HE'S GONE ROGUE.
THAT'S BAD NEWS, NO MATTER HOW YOU SPLICE IT.
AAHH!
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS FALL, JUSTICE HAS A FIRST NAME. IT'S SPELLED T-O-N-Y. AND IT'S GONNA BURN. CHRIS BALONEY IS TONY BALONEY IN "THE VIGALONI."
Jon:  WE'LL BE RIGHT
