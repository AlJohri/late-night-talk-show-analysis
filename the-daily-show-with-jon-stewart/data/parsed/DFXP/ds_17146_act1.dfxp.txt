A PARTY TOO PATRIOTIC FOR FACTS. A CANDIDATE TOO SUCCESSFUL FOR TAXES; A CITY WHOSE NAME SOUNDS LIKE TAMPON, FROM  TAMPA, FLORIDA, THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION, THE ROAD TO JEB BUSH 2016. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TUNING IN. WE ARE ON ON A FRIDAY NIGHT T IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR US. AND I'M-- LET'S JUST-- HERE'S THE-- I'M THE-- HERE'S THE FACT. THIS HAS BEEN A LONG WEEK. WE ARE ON THE ROAD, AWAY FROM OUR FAMILIES, THE PEOPLE HERE IN TAMPA HAVE BEEN VERY NICE, VERY  HOSPITABLE, BUT LET'S FACE FACTS. IT IS HOTTER THAN A GORILLA'S ANUS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR TO GORILLAS--  (LAUGHTER) -- THAT IS A DRY HEAT. (APPLAUSE) THE WORST PART OF THIS TOWN-- THE WORST PART OF THIS TOWN, YOU CAN'T EVEN  SIT DOWN TO TAKE A BREAK FROM THE UNRELENTING HEAT BECAUSE THE MOMENT YOU FORM  ANY KIND OF LAP IN THE TAMPA-ST. PETE AREA, YOU ARE SET UPON BY THOSE WHO SEEK  TO DANCE UPON SAID LAP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: DO YOU KNOW-- DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET MONEY DOWN IN TAMPA THAT  DOES NOT HAVE BODY GLITTER ON IT? (LAUGHTER) I WAS ADMITTEDLY A LITTLE DOWN LAST NIGHT, FROM BEING HERE THIS WHOLE WEEK, A  LITTLE DISSPIRITED. AND THEN-- NO, NO-- AND THEN IT HAPPENED. YES! AMIDST THE TIRED RHETORIC, EMPTY PLATITUDES AND OVERWROUGHT ATTACKS, A FISTFUL OF AWESOME! (LAUGHTER) EMERGED IN THE NIGHT WHERE IT SPENT 12 MINUTES ON THE MOST IMPORTANT NIGHT OF MITT  ROMNEY'S LIFE, YELLING AT A CHAIR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES. AND OH HOW THE OUTLAW JOSSIE WAILED.
HOW DO YOU HANDLE-- HOW DO YOU HANDLE IT? I MEAN WHAT DOW SAY TO PEOPLE? DO YOU JUST-- YOU KNOW, I KNOW PEOPLE-- PEOPLE ARE WONDERING-- YOU DON'T-- YOU  DON'T-- OKAY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? (LAUGHTER) THIS IS THE MOST JOY I'VE GOTTEN FROM AN OLD MAN. (LAUGHTER)
SINCE DICK CHENEY NONFATALLY SHOT ONE IN THE FACE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN-- THIS IS-- MORE, GIVE ME MORE.
I'M NOT GOING TO SHUT UP, IT'S MY TURN. SO ANYWAY-- .
Jon: I'M HERE TO LEND MY SUPPORT TO MITT ROMNEY IN HIS CRUCIAL HOUR. WILL YOU NOT SILENCE ME, INVISIBLE BARACK OBAMA. (LAUGHTER) I AM GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, BACK WHERE WE WORK AT THE DAILY SHOW ON  THE WEST SIDE OF HE'LL KITCHEN IN NEW YORK CITY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FAR TO SEE AN OLD MAN YELLING AT AN INANIMATE OBJECT. (LAUGHTER) BUT RARELY IS THAT OBJECT ON STAGE AT A NATIONAL POLITICAL CONVENTION. AND ALMOST NEVER IS THAT OLD MAN OSCAR WINNER CLINT EASTWOOD. (APPLAUSE) NOT THAT ROMNEY DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO-- YOU KNOW, I THINK HE TALKED TOO.
WE AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS FELT A SPECIAL KINSHIP WITH THE FUTURE.
Jon: YES, YES, WE AMERICANS UNIQUELY AMONG EARTH'S PEOPLE, MOVE FORWARD IN TIME. LOOK, I DON'T--  (LAUGHTER) I DON'T CARE HOW MANY MARCO'S RUBIO YOU PUT IN BETWEEN  CLINT EASTWOOD AND MITT ROMNEY, ROMNEY AIN'T OUTSHINING THIS LITTLE PLAYLET I LIKE TO CALL THE  OLD MAN AND THE SEAT. AND HERE'S WHY--  (LAUGHTER) IT HURTS-- HERE'S WHY IT HURTS. IT HURT THESE REPUBLICANS BAD BECAUSE THIS CONVENTION LIKE ALL CONVENTIONS IS A  SCRIPTED AND FOCUSED GROUP FANTASY AND THE DISPLAY OF EASTWOOD'S GRAN TORINO ID  WAS THE VERY THING REPUBLICANS HAD CONSTRUCTED THE ENTIRE WEEK TO SUPPRESS. THIS CONVENTION WAS THE VISION OF A PERFECT AMERICA, THAT USE ODD TO EXIST UNTIL BARACK OBAMA RUINED IT, AND SO WHAT IF THAT AMERICA HAD  NEVER ACTUALLY EXISTED.
TO BE AN AMERICAN WAS TO ASSUME THAT ALL THINGS WERE POSSIBLE, THAT UNIQUE BLEND  OF OPTIMISM, HUMILITY, IT'S THAT GOOD FEELING WHEN YOU HAVE MORE TIME TO VOLUNTEER  TO COACH YOUR KID'S SOCCER TEAM OR HELP OUT ON SCHOOL TRIPS. IT'S WHEN WE SEE THAT NEW BUSINESS OPENING UP DOWNTOWN. IT'S WHEN WE GO TO WORK IN THE MORNING AND SEE EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE BLOCK  DOING THE SAME THING. MY FRIENDS CARED MORE ABOUT WHAT SPORTS TEAMS WE FOLLOWED THAN WHAT CHURCH WE WENT TO.
Jon: GEE WHIZ, POPS, THAT SOUNDS AWESOME. YEAH, THAT WAS THE UNCOMPLICATED AMERICA YOU REMEMBER. I THINK IN THE EARLY 6030s THERE WERE SOME CHURCHES IN ALABAMA THAT WOULD HAVE  DISAGREED WITH YOUR SPORTS TEAM VERSUS PLACE OF WORSHIP ANECDOTE. BUT THE POINT IS THIS-- WHAT THIS CONVENTION ATTEMPTED TO DO IS SAY THAT WE COULD ALL  LIVE AGAIN IN THIS NOSTALGIC PARADISE IF IT WEREN'T FOR THIS ONE [BLEEP] GUY!
THE PRESIDENT HAS DISAPPOINTED AMERICA BECAUSE HE HASN'T LEAD AMERICA IN  THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
BARACK OBAMA'S FAILED US. WEAKENED AMERICA'S CONFIDENCE.
DIMINISHED THE DREAMS.
LIBERTY LIMITING RADICAL LEFT WING ANTI-BUSINESS RECKLESS SPENDING TAX HIKING  PARTY OF BARACK OBAMA-- .
Jon: HEY, HIS WIFE IS NICE THOUGH, I LIKE HIS WIFE, HEH. WOW, IT'S FOUR YEARS, ONE MAN, BARACK OBAMA HAS BROKEN THE GREATEST NATION GOD HAS  EVER GIVE THEN EARTH. THE MESSAGE OF THIS CONVENTION IS THAT APPARENTLY UP UNTIL AROUND NOVEMBER OF 2008 AMERICANS  LIVED IN A UTOPIAN IDEAL BORN OF OUR OWN GUMPTION AND INDIVIDUAL HARD WORK BUT  SADLY NOW, NOT FOUR YEARS LATER IT IS A BLYTHED SOCIALIST HELL SCAPE WITH  JACK FOOTED THUGS LOCK YOU UP FOR THINKING ABOUT CHRISTMAS. AND HERE IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE PART OF THE ENTIRE FICTION. WHILE CONVINCING US THAT BARACK OBAMA'S DESTROYED THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE, THE  REPUBLICANS HAVE ALSO INVENTED A PAST WHERE THEY WERE TRYING TO HELP HIM SUCCEED.
THAT CHOICE WAS NOT THE CHOICE OF OUR PARTY BUT AMERICANS ALWAYS COME  TOGETHER AFTER ELECTIONS.
I WISH PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD SUCCEEDED BECAUSE I WANT AMERICA TO SUCCEED. BZ BULL [BLEEP] [BLEEP].
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU WANTED OBAMA TO SUCCEED? WE MAY NOT REMEMBER THAT AMERICA WAS NEVER REALLY MAYBERRY, BUT WE SURE AS  [BLEEP] CAN REMEMBER BACK TO 2009. THIS IS THE NEWS PACKAGE FROM HANNITY'S SHOW, 100 DAYS INTO THE PRESIDENCY.
SO HELP YOU GOD.
SO HELP ME GOD.
CONGRAT LAKESES. -- CONGRATULATIONS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELL, HE DID GIVE THE PRESIDENT 100 DAYS BEFORE CUING UP THE SONG FROM THE OMEN. (LAUGHTER) ANYBODY LESS FORGIVING? >>.
THE ECONOMY IS SO BAD AND SO SHAKY, AND THE OBAMA VISION HAS NOT WORKED AT ALL, ZERO. NOW AGAIN, IT'S ONLY BEEN SIX WEEKS, BUT IT ISN'T WORKING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I MEAN COME ON, THE GUY'S HAD 42 DAYS TO BIGGEST THE BIGGEST FINANCIAL  CATASTROPHE IN HIS LIFETIME. HE HAD HIS CHANCE. BUT STILL 42 DAYS IS 42 DAYS. ANYBODY WANT TO JUMP ON THE I HOPE HE FAILS BAND WAG ORNTION I DON'T KNOW, EIGHT  DAYS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY.
RUSH LIMBAUGH AS YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR, HAS TAKEN A LOT OF HEAT FOR SAYING THAT HE DOES NOT WISH THIS PRESIDENT WELL.
RUSH IS PARTIALLY RIGHT, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TRY AND PARS WORDS HERE BUT OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT FAILED  POLICIES TO SUCCEED.
Jon: I MEAN IT'S BEEN EIGHT DAYS. WE'VE BEEN WAITING AN ENTIRE HANUKKAH FOR OBAMA TO SUCCEED. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE HASN'T FIXED IN 8 DAYS WHAT OUR GUY DID IN EIGHT YEARS. AND THAT'S WHY CLINT EASTWOOD COMES IN. AND THAT IS WHERE CLINT EASTWOOD HAS DONE A HUGE FAVOR TO US ALL. BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S IRRATIONALITY THAT THEY HAVE WORKED SO HARD AT  THE CONVENTION TRYING TO CONCEAL WAS UNLEASHED IN A 12 MINUTE IMPROVISED AVANT-GARDE PERFORMANCE OF  ONE ANGRY MEN. EASTWOOD FINALLY REVEALED THE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE THAT IS THE BEATING HEART  AND SOUL AND FICTION OF THIS PARTY. HE'S SO FAR GONE THEY ARE HAMMERING OBAMA FOR THINGS BUSH DID. AND ROMNEY IS.
BUT YOU THOUGHT THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN WAS-- WAS OKAY, I MEAN YOU THOUGHT  THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS WORTH DOING. WE DIDN'T CHECK CHECK WITH THE RUSSIANS TO SEE HOW THEY DID THERE FOR THE TEN YEARS, BUT-- .
Jon: OH, SNAP. YOU REALLY GAVE IT TO THE GUY WHO DIDN'T GET US INTO THAT WAR. (LAUGHTER)
I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA FOR ATTORNEYS TO BE PRESIDENT ANYWAY.
Jon: YEAH, TAKE THAT HARVARD LAUER BARACK OBAMA, YOU'LL NEVER BE THE MAN HARVARD LAWYER MITT ROMNEY IS. SO WE-- WE OH CLINT EASTWOOD A DEBT OF THANKS. NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS A TRULY HILARIOUS 12 MINUTES OF IMPROVISED AWESOME IN A  WEEK OF SCRIPTED BLAH, BUT BECAUSE IT ADVANCED OUR UNDERSTANDING. THIS PRESIDENT HAS ISSUES AND THERE ARE VERY LEGITIMATE DEBATES TO BE HAD ABOUT HIS POLICIES AND  ACTIONS AND SUCCESSES AND OR FAILURES AS PRESIDENT. I MEAN TUNE IN NEXT WEEK. (LAUGHTER) BUT COY NEVER WRAP MY HEAD AROUND WHY THE WORLD AND THE PRESIDENT, THAT REPUBLICANS  DESCRIBE BEARS SO LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE WORLD AND THE PRESIDENT THAT I EXPERIENCE. AND NOW I KNOW WHY. THERE IS A PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT ONLY REPUBLICANS CAN SEE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND WHILE THE PRESIDENT, THE REST OF US SEE HAS ISSUES, APPARENTLY THIS PRESIDENT, INVISIBLE TO MANY, IS BENT ON OUR WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION. BUT LOOK, INVISIBLE OBAMA IS GREAT FOR MY BUSINESS. I'M STILL SAD TRUMP'S NOT RUNNING. (LAUGHTER) BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE THIS ELECTION ABOUT THIS GUY? LET ME SEE IF I CAN PARAPHRASE. GO AHEAD, MAKE MY DAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
