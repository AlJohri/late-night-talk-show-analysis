Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW RON HOWARD. WHAT IS UP, BROTHER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WHAT IS HAPPENING? ABOUT. WHAT?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW. HOW DO YOU CHOOSE THE MOVIES THE DA VINCI CODE. ANGELS AND DEMONS. WHAT IS THE TRILOGY YOU ARE WORKING ON?
THE DARK TOWER SERIES. >>|ï¿½ Jon: YOU HAVE THE BROADEST CAREER.
I LOVE ALL KINDS OF MOVIES AND I WANT TO EXPLORE THE MEDIUM. AS AN ACTOR WAS CATEGORIZED IN A PARTICULAR WAY PRETTY MUCH. AS I FILMMAKER I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I RAN THE GAMUT. I HAVE NOT DONE A COMEDY IN A LONG TIME BUT BEING AROUND ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT WHICH I WAS  ONE OF THE PRODUCERS ON --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- A COUPLE YEARS AGO I NOTICED I ENJOYED BEING AROUND THE WRITERS AND ACTORS AND IT WAS  FUN BEING INVOLVED. I STARTED LOOKING FOR SOMETHING I COULD KREBLGT. I DIDN'T -- -- COULD DIRECT. I FOUND THIS TO BE A FRESH INTERESTING SUBJECT.
Jon: IT'S A -- YOU KNOW, WHAT IS AMAZING TO ME IS YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR ENTHUSIASM. HOW LONG HAVE BEEN IN THIS STPWHEUZ SINCE YOU WERE A CHILD. HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU STARTED? [COUGHING]
Jon: ARE YOU GOING TO DIE? IS IT A PIECE OF BEARD? WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN THERE?
CATCHING MY WIFE'S COLD.
Jon: LET'S JUST DO THIS.
52 YEARS. THAT WAS THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION.
Jon: YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS 52 YEARS?
RIGHT.
Jon: AND YOU ARE ONLY 49. HOW DID YOU PULL THAT OFF? YOUR ENTHUSIASM FOR IT. YOUR LACK OF CYNICISM TOWARDS IT AND IT'S A BUSINESS IN MANY WAYS  BUILT ON THAT, HOW WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT. HAVE YOU BEEN SHELTERED? ARE YOU RESILIENT? WHAT IS THE SECRET TO CONTINUING?
IT'S CREATIVE, IT'S DIFFERENT. EVERY NEWS STORY WHETHER IT'S A COMEDY OR A DRAMA YOU ARE EXPLORING SOMETHING ABOUT PEOPLE. THE TALENTED PEOPLE -- OH, MY GOD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DO YOU WANT TO WHISPER IT TO ME.
IT'S BECOMING AN EPISODE OF ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT OR THE SIMPSONS.
Jon: IF YOU WANT TO WRITE IT DOWN AND I'LL READ IT FOR YOU.
I THINK I'M OKAY [MAKING CLEARING THROAT SOUNDS] YOU WERE SAYING?
I GOT IT NOW.
Jon: NOW WE GOT IT.
IT'S ENDLESSLY FASCINATING. WHETHER YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT SCIENCE OR THE MIND OR POLITICS OR A COMEDY ABOUT, YOU  KNOW, CONTEMPORARY CIRCUMSTANCES AS TRICKY AND PARTICULAR AS THIS ONE IN THE DILEMMA IT'S FUN. I GREW UP IN IT. I WAS A CHILD ACTOR. THE ENVIRONMENT IS A PLACE I'M COMFORTABLE. THAT PROCESS IS EXCITING AND I LOVE CREATING STORIES.
Jon: IT FEELS AS THOUGH YOU WERE ALMOST DESIGNED FOR THIS BUSINESS IN THAT --  [LAUGHTER] -- IN THE RESILIENCE OF IT. IS THAT -- WHAT DROVE YOU TO GET INTO -- IF IT'S 52 YEARS AGO YOU ]U"T HAVE BEEN A --
WELL, I WAS 4.
Jon: YOU SAID AT THAT TIME TO YOUR PARENTS, I WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT.
AND THEN DIRECT.
Jon: YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL STORIES IN MOVING PICTURES.
MY DAD IS IN THE DILEMMA. CONTINUES TO ACT AT AGE 82. HE LOVES IT. IT WAS INFECTIOUS. I WAS LUCKY. I KNEW I LIKED IT. THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW WAS CREATIVE. IT WAS COLLABORATIVE AND THE ACTORS WERE HAVING A GREAT TIME. PEOPLE WERE GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF IT AND IT WAS GOOD TO BE A PART OF IT.
Jon: EVEN IN THE TIMES, THE BUSINESS BEING ON THAT SHOW, IT WAS SUCH A LIGHT SHOW. THE PEOPLE SEEMED LIKE GOOD PEOPLE. WERE YOU NOT EXPOSED TO THE SORT OF MORE NEGATIVE SIDE. MAYBE AN EARLY FOUNDATIONAL TIME.
VERY LUCKY. IT WAS A GREAT ENVIRONMENT AND IT REALLY WAS CREATIVE. EVEN AS A LITTLE KID I WAS ACTUALLY ALLOWED TO COMMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT THIS AND THE OTHER. THIS LINE DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT AND SO FORTH. FOR THE WHOLE FIRST SEASON I KEPT THROWING IN MY TWO CENTS  AND NO ONE SEEMED TO|iT8&?mX ftX 6C:&lt;e;I IN THE SECOND EPISODE OF THE  SECOND SEASON, I REMEMBER THIS. I WAS SUPPOSED TO COME BACKING INTO THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND SAY SOMETHING. I STOPPED AND THE DIRECTOR SAID WHAT IS THE PROBLEM. I SAID I DON'T THINK A KID WOULD SAY IN THIS WAY. I SAID WHATEVER I THOUGHT IT WAS AND HE SAID, FINE, SAY IT THAT WAY. I REMEMBER FEELEY REALLY -- FEELING REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE AN IDEA. ANDY SAID, COME ON, WHAT ARE YOU STANDING THERE FOR YOUNGIN? YOU WOULD ACTUALLY CALL PEOPLE YOUNGIN.
Jon: WHEN YOU WALKED TO THE SET WOULD YOU ACTUALLY WHISTLE THAT SONG, TOO?
HE WOULD SAY WHAT IS THE MATTER, RONNIE? WHAT IS GOING ON? I SAID IT'S THE FIRST IDEA YOU ACCEPTED. ANDY SAID, IT WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT WAS ANY DAMN GOOD.
Jon: IF EVERYONE HAD THE TYPE OF ATTITUDE THEY HAD IN THEIR LINE OF WORK IT SEEMS LIKE --
I'M LUCKY. I LOVE IT.
Jon: THE FILMS YOU MAKE ARE SUCH A NICE LEVEL. I APPRECIATE IT.
THANKS.
