APRIL 3, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART. TONIGHT, MAN, OUR GUEST TONIGHT, WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, TOM GOLDSTEIN, HE'S AN ATTORNEY AND THE MAN BEHIND-- I DON'T  NEED TO TELL YOU-- SCOTUSBLOG. SCOTUSBLOG ONE OF THE MOST IN-DEPTH SITES ABOUT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. GO TO SCOTUS TKPWHROG FOR THE ANALYSIS OF IMPORTANT DECISIONS, STAY FOR THE SCALIA/ALEE TO SLASH FICTION. (LAUGHTER) MY WRITERS ASSURE ME THAT'S A REAL THING. I GOT UP AND PLOPPED DOWN IN FRONT OF THE "TODAY" SHOW WITH THE MORNING JUMBLE AND A  MICROWAVED CUP OF OVALTINE AND I'M EXPECTING TO CATCH UP ON THE  MORNING NEWS, WEATHER, KIND OF A FUN FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE, MAYBE CATCH A COUPLE QUICK SEGMENTS ON  HOW BEST TO DRESS FOR MY BODY TYPE. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, THE "TODAY" SHOW. BUT WHAT DO I SEE?
TELL EVERYBODY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE COMING TO 30 ROCK YESTERDAY.
OH, GEEZ, MATT, NICEST LADY IN THE WORLD STOPPED ME, ASKED  ME WHERE I WAS HEADED, I SAID 30 ROCK AND SHE SAID "OH, HONEY, COME HERE, I TOLD YOU, TINA FEY IS HERE!"
Jon: (LAUGHS) OH, THAT... THAT NEVER HAPPENED. (LAUGHTER) YOU HAVE A PHALANX OF SECURITY .N MY GUESS IS NOBODY GOT A WHIFF. IT'S SARAH PALIN COHOSTING THE "TODAY" SHOW. AND SHE WAS THERE PERFORMING A MEDLEY OF HER GREATEST HITS FROM  "I DON'T READ NEWSPAPERS" TO "I WRITE ON MY HAND." (LAUGHTER)  TO THAT OLD CHESTNUT "I PASS I AGGRESSIVELY HATE MATT LAUER  WITH EVERY OUNCE OF MY BEING."
HOW'S IT GOING SO FAR GOVERNOR?
THANKS FOR LETTING ME CRASH YOUR DRESSING ROOM AND NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR HAIR PRODUCT... (LAUGHTER).
TECHNICALLY I DIDN'T GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO BE IN THERE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SERIOUSLY. I'M NOT BEING LIGHT HEARTED ABOUT THIS. I DO NOT GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO GO IN THERE. OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SCRIPTED BANTER BASED ON THE FACT THAT MATT LAUER NO  LONGER NEEDS A HAIR BRUSH. KIND OF A FUNNY... UNLESS... OH! (AUDIENCE REACTS) DEAR GOD! HOW DID WE GET THAT IMAGE? MATT LAUER HOPEFULLY HAVING SEX WITH A BADGER. GOOD FOR YOU, MATT, KICKING IT OLD SCHOOL. CANCEL LAUER'S INVITATION TO POOL PARTY. (LAUGHTER) DRAINS CAN'T HANDLE. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S THE THING-- THANK GOD WE GOT THAT PICTURE. THE FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR WAS ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD AND LIKABLE IN THIS SETTING. MY ISSUE WAS NOT WITH HOW I VIEWED GOVERNOR PALIN AS COHOST OF THE "TODAY" SHOW, IT WAS  MOSTLY WITH HOW GOVERNOR PALIN SEEMED TO VIEW IT.
WE DID READ A TWEET YOU SENT OUT THAT SAID "GONNA GO ROGUE AND INFILTRATE."  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: OOH. INFILTRATING THE "TODAY" SHOW. I THINK IT MEANS YOU'RE CYNICALLY EXPLOIT AGO MANUFACTURED NOTION OF YOURSELF  AS A CRUSADER AGAINST A MONOLITHIC EXCLUSIONARY ACTIVIST LIBERAL MEDIA WHAO *ELS ACTUALLY  ENJOYING A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. SERIOUSLY. SERIOUSLY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S THE "TODAY" SHOW! DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE O HOSTING THE "TODAY" SHOW IS ENTERING THE  LION'S DEN ARMED ONLY WITH SOME JESUS FISH EARRINGS AND AN IWO JIMA SIZED FLAG PIN? SERIOUSLY, LOOK AT THAT (BLEEP)ING FLAG PIN. IF A HAMSTER WENT TO THE MOON, THAT IS THE FLAG IT WOULD PLANT. (LAUGHTER) THAT THING'S GIGANTIC! (APPLAUSE) GOVERNOR PALIN ACTS LIKE SHE NEEDED TO PROTECT HERSELF FROM THE LAMESTREAM LIBERALS LIKE  GARLIC TO A VAMPIRE WHEN THE TRUTH IS YOU'RE AT THE "TODAY" SHOW! YOU'RE THERE TO TALK ABOUT PARTY PLANNING WITH TORI SPELLING! TO PRETEND THAT YOU REMEMBER WHO WILSON PHILLIPS IS. OR TO HANG OUT FOR SOME LIGHT HARDED COUCH BANTER WITH MATT AND ANN AND AL INSTEAD OF ACTING  LIKE YOU'RE SITTING WITH WHICH HE AND LENIN AND SAUL ALYNSKY. YOU'RE PRETENDING THIS APPEARANCE IS SOME UNCOMMONLY BALLSY WAY OF STICKING IT TO THE  LAMESTREAM MEDIA. IT'S JUST ANOTHER PLACE FOR YOU TO TOUT YOUR BRAND OF HOMESPUN NONSENSE UNCHALLENGED!
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU'RE HAPPY WITH MITT ROMNEY AS THE  PARTY'S NOMINATION.
ANYBODY BUT OBAMA. I HONESTLY BELIEVE ANYBODY RUNNING ON THAT G.O.P. TICKET WOULD BE INFINITELY BETTER THAN  WHAT WE HAVE TODAY WITH THESE FAILED SOCIAL POLICIES.
Jon: OH, FAILED SOCIALIST POLICIES OF BARACK OBAMA. I GET IT. AND CUT TO TWO MINUTES LATER, SAME INTERVIEW.
LET'S TALK ABOUT CAN THE ECONOMY. DO YOU THINK IT'S IMPROVING?
FOR WHOM? MAYBE FOR SOME ON WALL STREET.
Jon: RIGHT! WALL STREET! FAT CATS REAPING THE BENEFITS OF THE FAILED SOCIALIST... (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WAIT! THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE! YOU KNOW WHAT? WHO GIVES A (BLEEP) IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE? IT'S 7:00 IN THE MORNING PEOPLE ARE WATCHING IT WHILE MISTAKINGLY BUTTERING POP-TARTS! (LAUGHTER) BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE KIND OF INFURIATED  WITH YOU, IT'S NOT YOUR COMMON-SENSE CONSERVATISMISM OR YOUR MAMA GRIZZLY TENACITY, IT'S  THE CASUAL MANNER WITH WHICH YOU ACCUSE EVERYBODY YOU DISAGREE WITH OF DIVIDING AMERICA WHILE  SIMULTANEOUSLY AND VERY CASUALLY DOING THIS.
OPRAH GAVE A RATHER CANDID INTERVIEW ON ANOTHER MORNING SHOW YESTERDAY MORNING AND  ADMITTED SHE'S MADE MANY MISTAKES IN CREATING AND STARTING UP HER OWN NETWORK. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS NEXT YEAR OWN IS NO LONGER AROUND.
I THINK IT WILL BE AROUND IF SHE'LL GET CONSERVATIVES ON THE SHOW. SOME HATES ON THE SHOW!
Jon: DID YOU SEE IT RIGHT THERE? OPRAH WOULD DO WELL IF SHE COULD GET CONSERVATIVES ON THERE. YOU KNOW, PATRIOTS WHO UNDERSTAND THE CONSTITUTION. THAT'S IN THE A NUTSHELL. THE SIMPLICITY AND PREJUDICE OF YOUR WORLD VIEW THAT THE PATRIOTISM AND GOODNESS OF  SOMETHING IS IN DIRECT PROPORTION ONLY TO THE AMOUNT OF CONSERVATISM IN SAID THING. AND THAT EQUATION SO RULES YOUR LIFE THAT YOU OFFERED THAT ADVICE SPONTANEOUSLY TO THE  QUESTION OF "HOW DO YOU THINK OPRAH'S DOING?" (LAUGHTER) I GOT TO TELL YOU, LADY... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT MUST BE EXHAUSTING TO LIVE LIKE THAT. ALTHOUGH LIBERALS WHO ARE PATRIOTS, IT IS PRETTY FUNNY. NOW YOU MAY BE WONDERING HOW A HIGH PROFILE CONSERVATIVE LIKE SARAH PALIN COULD INFILTRATE  AMERICA'S FAVORITE MORNING SHOW IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. WE WONDER IT HAD SAME THING SO WE SENT JOHN OLIVER OVER THERE THIS MORNING TO INVESTIGATE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHEN SARAH PALIN ANNOUNCED HER AUDACIOUS INFILTRATION OF  THE "TODAY" SHOW SHE WAS UNDERTAKING A PERILOUS VOYAGE, FROM THE CONSERVATIVE FOX HOLE TO NBC'S LIBERAL HORNET'S NEST. IF SHE SUCCEEDS IN THIS DANGEROUS CROSSING, SHE WILL END UP IN THE BELLY OF THE BEAST, THE HEART OF THE LIBERAL MEDIA. (CAR BLEEPING) I'M (BLEEP)ING REPORTING HERE! WITH HER WAR PAINT APPLIED, I TRIED TO WARN HER OF WHAT SHE HAD IN STORE WHILE ALSO TRYING  TO BLEND IN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST HOST, SARAH PALIN.
EVERYONE STANDING IN THE COLD WIND WITNESSING HER FIRST STEPS INTO ENEMY TERRITORY WAS  INSPIRED BY HER COURAGE. WAS THAT THE BRAVEST THING YOU'VE EVER SEEN?
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT, NO. I.
WAS IT THE SECOND-BRAVEST THING?
IT WAS BRAVE, I WOULD SAY.
HER STEEL IS SCORCHED, HER STEEL IS TEMPERED, HER STEEL IS POLISHED, IT'S PERFECTED.
OKAY, I GET THE STEEL ANALOGY. SHE'S A PIECE OF STEEL.
SARAH PALIN SAID SHE'S INFILTRATING THE SHOW TODAY.
YEAH.
DO YOU THINK SHE'S MISTAKING THE WORD "INFILTRATING FOR"  "BEING INVITED ON"?
YEAH, MAYBE.
BUT THE THRONGS OF TOURISTS WERE ALSO CONCERNED FOR HER SAFETY.
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED. I'VE SEEN WHAT THEY DID, LIKE, ESPECIALLY WHEN I SAW THE KATIE COURIC INTERVIEW BACK IN THE 2008 ELECTION.
THAT WAS WHEN THEY MADE HER LOOK LIKE A (BLEEP)ING IDIOT. LAUGH.
I HAVE TO SAY THAT WAS NOT EVEN AN INTERVIEW, IT WAS AN AMBUSH.
IT WAS AN AMBUSH OF WORDS AND QUESTIONS.
SURE.
SADLY, WHILE SARAH SUCCESSFULLY INFILTRATED, HER SUPPORTERS WERE KEPT OUT BY  NBC'S LIBERAL THUGS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SHARE THEIR BEAUTIFUL VISION WITH THE WORLD. THIS IS THE BANNER THAT NBC WOULD NOT ALLOW ON TELEVISION. THE POWERFUL IMAGE OF SARAH PALIN BEING KARATE CHOPPED BY RONALD REAGAN'S GHOST.
I WOULD SAY WHEN I CREATED THIS SHE WAS BEING SALUTED BY HIM.
SALUTED BY HIS GHOST, NOT KARATE CHOPPED? THAT'S MUCH MORE SENSIBLE. INFILTRATING THE TARGET IS ONE THING. SHE NOW HAD TO EMBARK ON THE LONG JOURNEY BACK TO THE SAFETY OF HER BASE CAMP. AFTERWARDS THE CONCERN IS HOW SARAH PALIN WILL GET FROM 30 ROCK BACK TO THE FOX NEWS BUILDING. IT'S A PERILOUS JOURNEY THAT MAY TAKE HER AS MUCH... ACTUALLY, WE'RE ALREADY... THAT'S IT, IT'S RIGHT THERE. HOLY (BLEEP) THAT'S (BLEEP)ING CLOSE. PALIN STRUCK A BLOW AGAINST THE ALL-POWERFUL LIBERAL MEDIA. BUT THE WAR WAS FAR FROM WON. DO YOU THINK WE'LL EVER SEE THE DAY WHERE THERE WILL BE A CONSERVATIVE MEDIA?
NO.
REALLY. EVEN A DOMINEERING MEDIA ORGANIZATION LITERALLY A BLOCK AND A HALF FROM HERE?
NEVER.
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN, WILL IT?
NEVER.
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.
BUT SARAH PALIN WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT-- ONE AWKWARD TORI SPELLING COOKING  SEGMENT AT A TIME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
