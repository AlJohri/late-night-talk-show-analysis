I HAD CLASS AT YALE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HOLD ON. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:  DID YOU FIND OUT YOU HAD BEEN NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR BEFORE OR  AFTER CLASS.
BEFORE CLASS. THEY WANTED KNOW SKIP CLASS SO I COULD BE IN TOWN IN NEW YORK TO GO ON "TODAY" SHOW. I SAID, NO, I'M IN THE GOING TO SKIP CLASS. ESPECIALLY IF I DIDN'T GET NOMINATED.
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE I'M ENCOURAGING JUVENILE  DELINQUENCY OR VANDALISM BUT I THINK THE DAY YOU ARE NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR IS THE DAY YOU  COULD CALL IN AND SAY, "I'M NOT COMING TO CLASS TODAY. ".
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.
Jon: WHAT WAS THE CLASS?
IT WAS A CLASS ON BYRON KEATS, ROMANTIC POETS --
Jon: WELL, IT IS THREE.
HE WOULDN'T WANT TO PUSH IT.
Jon: DID THEY SAY ANYTHING MR. FRANCO, BY THE WAY.
NOBODY KNEW.
Jon: WELL DONE, SIR.
NOBODY KNEW. I GOT THE ANNOUNCEMENT. I WENT ON THE "TODAY" SHOW AND WITH WALKED DOWN THE STREET AND WENT TO CLASS. NOBODY SAID A THING. I DIDN'T EXPECT THEM TO.
Jon: NO ONE PERHAPS COMPOSED AN ODE TO YOUR NOMINATION. OH, THE FLOWERS BE SWEET BUT THE GOLDEN MAN BE BETTER THAN -- INTERESTS -- THERE'S A LOT THAT  RHYMES WITH SWEET.
THAT WAS GREAT.

ABOUT 15, 20.
Jon: IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL CLASS.
YEAH, YEAH.

Jon: IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE. THE OTHER THING THAT IS GREAT YOU ARE GOING TO THE OSCAR AS A THOM KNEE AND A -- NOMINEE AND  ALSO AS A HOST.
WE CHATTED, YOU AND I. YOU HAD A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN I WAS PLANNING ON.

A LITTLE SINGING AND DANCING.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE NICE?

Jon: A LITTLE BYRON, A LITTLE YATES.
YOU FINISH THE POEM.
Jon: DO YOU FEEL NERVOUS? BECAUSE YOU SHOULD NOT?
I REALLY DON'T. I FEEL LIKE ACTUALLY PEOPLE ARE KIND OF CONFUSED LIKE WHY AM I THE HOST? [LAUGHTER] SO I DON'T THINK THE EXPECTATIONS ARE HIGH, AND I THINK IF I GO OUT AND BE A NICE  GUY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE HAPPY.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A BALL. IT IS A JOYOUS NIGHT AND SUPER FUN TO DO NO MATTER WHAT THE AUDIENCE MAY --
IT'S NICE FOR ME, TOO. I DON'T WANT TO SIT IN MY SEAT AND SWEAT. IT'S THE PERFECT EXCUSE TO KEEP BUSY.
