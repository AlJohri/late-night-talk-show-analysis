NOVEMBER 28, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'RE BACK, BABY. WE'RE BACK. THE HILARIOUS MERRILL MARKOE, AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK. SHE WILL BE JOINING US. IT IS AN EXCITING NIGHT FOR ME. IT IS MY BIRTHDAY. AS MY DAUGHTER SAID TO ME THIS MORNING, "DADDY, I WISH YOU WERE YOUNGER."  AND THEN IN THE POIGNANCY OF THE MOMENT TURNED AROUND AND WALKED OUT OF THE BATHROOM. BUT I HAVE A MIRROR I HAVE TO LOOK AT NOW. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED WE WERE GONE LAST WEEK. TOOK A LITTLE BREAK FOR THANKSGIVING. HAD A LITTLE RALLY TO RESTORE OBESITY. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? HELP ME. BUT IT'S ALSO TIME FOR REFLECTION. THAT WAS A (BEEP) SEGWAY. I APOLOGIZE. BUT IT IS A TIME FOR REFLECTION. I DIDN'T KNOW I WOULD BE MAKING MY BELLY TALK AND THEN... SO IN THE SPIRIT OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON, I WANT TO OFFER AN APOLOGY TO SOMEONE. AS YOU MAY RECALL ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO WE TOLD YOU ABOUT ONE NEW YORK CITY DEPUTY  INSPECTOR ANTHONY BALOGNE. A.K.A.TONY BALOGNE. HE GAINED A MEASURE OF INFAMY FOR HIS WORK IN TESTING THE TEAR DUCTS AND GAG REFLEXES OF  SEATED SLEEVELESS COLLEGE GIRLS. TURNED OUT THAT HIS ORIGINAL HYPOTHESIS WAS CORRECT, WEAPONS GRADE PEPPER SPRAY. OF COURSE FOR MAYOR BO BALOGNE RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF CONDEMNATION FOR HIS RANDOM  PEPPER SPRAYING OF OCCUPY WALL STREATERS AND SOME HOMAGES INCLUDING THE CREATION OF  NBC'S NEW HIT DRAMA TONY BALOGNE, THE VIGIL-OGNE STARRING CHRISTOPHER MELONI. THE THEME MUSIC FOR THAT DONE BY TONY, TONY TONY SPONSORED BY RICE-A-RONI. THE LEAD-IN PROGRAM, MY LITTLE PONY. WEIRD FIT DEMOGRAPHICALLY BUT THEY WORK TOGETHER. MY POINT IS THIS. BACK IN SEPTEMBER INSPECTOR BALOGNE SEEMED TO USE EXCESSIVE FORCE. AS IT TURNS OUT TONY BALOGNE IS SOFT ON PROTESTORS.
THE POLICE AT U.C.-DAVIS FIRED PEPPER SPRAY DIRECTLY INTO THE FACES OF PASSIVE  OCCUPY PROTESTORS WHO REFUSED TO MOVE AFTER BEING WARNED BY POLICE.
Jim: YOU KNOW, THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO GET COLLEGE KIDS TO MOVE. HEY, EVERYBODY! GREEN DAYS IN THE QUAD. FREE TALK OWES! WHAT? THE INFIRMARY AS A HERPES VACCINE? LET ME SHOW YOU ANOTHER QUICK LOOK AT THIS. I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT THE SHAPES THAT THE OFFICER APPEARS TO BE CASUALLY RUST-  PROOFING ARE HUMAN PEOPLE. WITH EYES AND LUNGS. THAT IS NOT A TERMITE NEST. NOW YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHO WERE THOSE THUGS? WHO WERE THOSE THUGS BEING DOUSED WITH WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS JERSEY SHORE  LEVELS OF ORANGE SPRAY? IT TURNS OUT THEY ARE STUDENTS.... ( APPLAUSE ) ... STUDENTS ENGAGED IN A NONVIOLENT PROTEST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. GO, FIGHTIN' PASS SIFT. PROTESTING RECENT TUITION HIKES AND THE OCCUPY WALL STREET MOVEMENT. THE CHIEF OF POLICE WILL EXPLAIN.
FOR THE SAFETY OF THE OFFICERS AND THE ARRESTEES SO THEY COULD GET OUT AND LEAVE.
Jon: THE SAFETY OF THE ARRESTEES. APPARENTLY THEY WERE SPRAYING THEM WITH NEOSPORIN. NOW, THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE POLICE ARE IN DANGER. IN A CROWD. AND THEY HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT JOB. IN ANY OF THESE SITUATIONS. BUT IN THOSE SITUATIONS THE POLICE USUALLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO LAY DOWN PRIMER AND TWO  COATS OF PEPPER SPRAY AND THEN STOP, READ THE DIRECTIONS ON THE CAN AND GET IT NICE AND MIXED UP. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE PAINT MURALS IN LESS TIME. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE SIDES. BOTH GREAT ARTISTS. WE MISS THEM TERRIBLY. STILL AS EXTREME AS THOSE COPS' ACTIONS WERE IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE. IT'S NOT LIKE U.C.-DAVIS IS A THIRD WORLD POLICE STATE WHERE SOMEONE WITH A CRAZY ACCENT IS  WIELDING POWER IRRATIONALLY.
TODAY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY APOLOGIZED.
I PERSONALLY FEEL REALLY VERY BAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. THE WHOLE INCIDENT.
Jon: THE CHANCELLOR HAS SPOKEN. AN APOLOGY HAS BEEN ISSUED FROM THE CHANCELLOR. HELLO. YOU MUST RETURN TO YOUR HOMES. THE CHANCELLOR HAS SPOKEN. ( APPLAUSE ) IT WOULD BE NICE IF HITLER'S MOUSTACHE HAD A HANDLE. THANKFULLY ALL THAT JUNK HAPPENED BEFORE THANKSGIVING. BY WEEK'S END ALL THOSE STUDENTS WERE SAFE AT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND MAYBE  GOT TO DO A LITTLE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING WHERE THEY WERE SAFE.
ONE WOMAN WAS TO INTENT ON GETTING HER HANDS ON A NEW X-BOX 360 AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE SHE  PEPPER SPRAYED HER FELLOW CUSTOMERS.
OFFICIALS CALLED THE WOMAN'S BEHAVIOR COMPETITIVE SHOPPING.
Jon: MERELY COMPETITIVE SHOPPING? WHAT A WEIRD "SEX IN THE CITY" WAY OF REBRANDING ASSAULT. I'M NOT A MURDERER. I'M A GHOST CREATOR. BY THE WAY IF IT WAS COMPETITIVE SHOPPING, I GUESS SHE WON.
WHEN ALL THIS MAYHEM AND CHAOS WAS GOING ON AND PEOPLE WERE SCRAMBLING, SHE WALKED  OUT AND WENT THROUGH THE CHECKOUT REGISTERS AND ACTUALLY PURCHASED THIS X-BOX 360.
Jon: WHAT THE HELL! I THINK THIS MAY SET A PRECEDENT THAT'S BAD. TONY BALOGNE USED PEPPER SPRAY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BRING ORDER. NOW IN ESSENCE IT IS ORDER THAT HAS BEEN PEPPER SPRAYED. WE'VE SUDDENLY BECOME A PEOPLE THAT USE PEPPER SPRAY TO ALLEVIATE MINOR INCONVENIENCES. PEPPER SPRAY HAS BECOME AMERICA'S NEW CAR HORN. PEPPER SPRAY IS OUR NEW (AHEM) BUT AS LONG AS IT GETS YOU YOUR X-BOX, THAT'S GREAT NEWS  FOR THAT SHOPPER'S KIDS BECAUSE NOW THEY CAN PLAY THE NEW FIRST PERSON SPRAYER GAME  BLACK FRIDAY. IT'S A GREAT GAME. LET ME SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT OF HERE. HERE WE GO. WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH IT. NOW WE WANT TO GO DOWN.
THERE'S PLENTY OF STUFF. (SCREAMING)
Jon: ALL RIGHT. ( APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAD THIS. FORTUNATELY PERSONALLY I HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO AVOID THE BLACK FRIDAY MADNESS. THIS YEAR AND TODAY ESPECIALLY CYBER MONDAY, I DO ALL MY SHOPPING ONLINE WHERE YOU  DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CRAZY PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE DOING IT. CYBER MONDAY. LET ME JUST LOG ON. ANOTHER (BEEP), (SCREAMING)!
