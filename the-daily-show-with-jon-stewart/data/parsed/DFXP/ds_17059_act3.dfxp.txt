WELCOME BACK. OUR GUESTS TONIGHT, THE UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF EDUCATION PLEASE WELCOME TO  THE PROGRAM SECRETARY ARNE DUNCAN. SIR. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: FOR THOSE PEOPLE WITHOUT DON'T REALIZE YOU YOURSELF PLAYED BASKETBALL  AT HARVARD, AND KNOW THIS PHENOM JEREMY LIN.
HE'S AN AMAZING YOUNG KID, SO PROUD OF HIM. HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT BUT HE'S THE ULTIMATE WINNER AND IS MAKING HIS TEAMMATES BETTER. WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT BASKETBALL, IT'S A TEAM SPORT, IT'S NOT GOLF AND  HE'S GETTING EVERYBODY INVOLVED.
Jon: THE WAY THE KNICKS HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT HAVE BEEN VERY SIMILAR TO GOLF. THAT YOU TRY AND GET A BALL IN THIS HOLE AND YOU JUST CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU GRADUATED HARVARD, DID YOU, I MEAN, IS IT A DISAPPOINTMENT, I GUESS, FOR TO YOU HAVE ENDED UP JUST AS  THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION? NOT-- NOT OBVIOUSLY AN NBA SUPERSTAR?
I'M SO THRILLED FOR HIM AND NO ONE DESERVES IT MORE THAN HIM AND HIS HUMILITY, HIS WILLINGNESS TO WORK HARD WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE DOUBTED HIM AND DIDN'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE. I THINK THE EXAMPLE HE SETS FOR YOUNG KIDS AROUND THIS COUNTRY, ASIAN AMERICANS, WHITE KIDS, BLACK KIDS, HISPANIC KIDS HE IS A REMARKABLE ROLE MODEL.
Jon: I'M HOPING IT WILL CHANGE. IT WILL GET A COUPLE OF DATES IN WITH THE KARDASHIANS AND THE WHOLE THING GOES TO HELL, BELIEVE ME.
NO NEW FRIENDS. STICK WITH THE OLD FRIENDS.
Jon: LET'S MOVE ON TO YOU. SO MY MOTHER IS A TEACHER. AND HER FRIENDS ARE TEACHERS. AND THEY CALL ME ALL HOURS, REALLY OF THE DAY AND NIGHT. AND THEY HAVE AN ISSUE, A LITTLE BIT W THIS RACE TO THE TOP INITIATIVE THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. IT WAS I GUESS A FIX TO NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. EXPLAIN RACE TO THE TOP.
WELL, A COUPLE OF THINGS. RACE TO THE TOP HAS DONE A COUPLE OF THINGS I THINK ARE SO IMPORTANT. WE ARE SEEING 46 STATES RAISE STANDARDS, FOR EVERY SINGLE CHILD. WE'RE TURNING AROUND UNDERPERFORMING SCHOOLS. I THINK NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WAS LARGELY BROKEN. WE'RE NOW PROVIDING WAIVER, FLEXIBILITY TO STATES, WHO WANTED CONGRESS TO FIX IT. CONGRESS IS PRETTY DYSFUNCTIONAL THESE DAY, UNFORTUNATELY.
Jon: I HAD NOT HEARD THAT.
SO WE'RE TRAYING TO FIX THINGS THE BEST WAY WE CAN. WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM TO MOVE AND WE CAME FROM AMAZING INNOVATION, CREATIVITY COMING FROM STATES.
Stephen: .
Jon: WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT IT IS A LOT OFth RHETORIC ON THE RACE TO THE  TOP AND THE RESPECT INITIATIVE IS ABOUT INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY. BUT WHAT I HEAR FROM THE TEACHERS IS THAT THERE IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN  CREATED THAT IS ACTUALLY MORE CONFINING BECAUSE IT IS CAUSING THE SCHOOLS TO TEACH  TO THE TESTS THAT THEY MUST HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR GRANT MONEY. AND THAT, AND THE THREE TEACHERS HERE TODAY-- ARE-- I THINK IT TENDS TO FRUSTRATE  THEM RATHER THAN FREE THEM TO BE CREATIVE AND POWERFUL INNOVATIVE TEACHERS THAT YOU  ARE LOOKING FOR.
RIGHT, SO I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THAT AND THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED IT.
Jon: SO THERE WE G SO WE'RE DONE HERE.
THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED IT DIRECTLY IN THE STATE OF UNION. HE SAID WE HAVE TO STOP TEACHING IT TO THE TEST. I LIVED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAW FOR SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS WHEN I RAN CHI PUBLIC SCHOOL. THAT IS THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT I HEAR AS I TRAVEL THE COUNTRY. YES, READING AND MATH ARE FUNDAMENTAL, FOUNDATIONAL BUT SCIENCE, SOCIAL STUDIES, DANCE, DRAMA, ART, MUSIC, FOREIGN LANGUAGES, PE, ALL THOSE THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL. AND WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THE FLEXIBILITY STATE IS MOVING AWAY FROM NO CHILD  LEFT BEHIND IS SAYING ALL THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT, YES, SO IS READING AND MATH, WE HAVE TO HAVE A WELL-ROUNDED, WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION FOR EVERY CHILD.
Jon: BUT ARE WE NOT STILL BROADENING THE CURRICULUM, OKAY YOU DON'T LIKE THE NARROWNESS OF THE TESTS IN THESE TWO SUBJECTS WHAT IF  WE GIVE YOU A LAZY SUSAN OF TESTS FOR A LOT OF --
I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT AT ALL. TESTS TELL YOU SOME THINGS. THEY DON'T TELL YOU LOTS OF OTHER THINGS SWRECHLT TO STOP FOCUS ON THE ABSOLUTE TEST SCORE. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT GROWTH IN GAINS, HOW MUCH THE STUDENT IS IMPROVING. I'M MORE INTERESTED IN LONGER TERM OUTCOME, LONG-TERM OUTCOMES. OUR GRADUATION RATE IS GOING UP. OUR DROPOUT RATE GOING DOWN, ARE MORE STUDENTS READY FOR COLLEGE R THEY PERSEVERING IN COLLEGE. WE HAVE TODAY KATE TO A BETTER ECONOMY. THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
Jon: IS THIS THE WAY TO DO IN YOU KNOW THE THING THAT STRIKES ME, AND I KNOW  HOW DIFFICULT IT IS I THINK EDUCATION IS PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT AREA TO ATTACK BECAUSE OF THE  ECOSYSTEM THAT IT IS INVOLVED IN. IT'S NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD. AND IT IS NOT, BUT SO MUCH OF THE ONUS NOW IS ON THE TEACHERS. AND BY CREATING THESE BENCHMARKS, IT GIVES THE FALSE OF IMPRESSION THAT TEACHING IS SCIENCE WHEN IN  MANY WAY TEACHING IS AN ART.
TEACHING IS AN ABSOLUTE ART. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE DONE AS A COUNTRY IS WE HAVE BEATEN DOWN TEACHERS, EDUCATION, THIS WHOLE RESPECT PROJECT THAT WE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY, IS TRYING TO DRAMATICALLY ELEVATE THE PROFESSION, STRENGTHEN THE PROFESSION. IT TAKES YEARS TO MASTER. YOUR MOM IS A TEACHER, MY MOM HAS BEEN WORKING IN THE INNER CITY FOR 50 YEARS. I KNOW HOW HARD THIS WORK IS. WE TREATED EVERYBODY THE SAME. WE HAVEN'T RECOGNIZED EXCELLENCE. WE HAVEN'T AWARDED IT. WE HAVEN'T LEARNED FROM IT I HAVE BEEN VERY PUBLIC WE SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY  INCREASE TEACHER SALARIES. NO ONE GOES INTO IT FOR THE MONEY BUT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THE VOW OF POVERTY.
Jon: NO, I THINK YOU MOSTLY GO INTO IF FORTH MONEY. THE PEOPLE I MEET WITH THEIR TOYOTAS, I HAVE SEEN-- I HAVE SEEN SOME THINGS.
WE NEED, WE HAVE A BABY BOOMING GENERATION RETIRING. WE'RE GOING TO NEED A UNTIL NEW GRADE TEACHERS.
Jon: I LOVE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, BUT ISN'T RACE TO THE TOP THE EXACT THING THAT  DEMORALLIZED THEM EVEN FURTHER THAN NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE THAT IS THE  ISSUE, ISN'T I THINK INTENTION, BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE INTENTION OF IF I WERE  IN EDUCATION OR THE PRESIDENT, THE RHETORIC YOU HEAR IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT THE METHODOLOGY THAT THEY HAVE EMPLOYED HAS NOT HAD THAT EFFECT. AND MAYBE IS THIS NOT THE BEST USE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE EDUCATION IS SUCH THE DIVERSITY OF LOCALITY, IT REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT EXISTS IN THE AREAS THIS WHICH THE KIDS ARE EDUCATED.
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS EMPOWER STATES AND DISTRICTS. I ALWAYS SAID I DON'T WANT TO MICROMANAGE FROM WASHINGTON, CAN'T DO IT. THE BEST IDEAS WILL ALWAYS COME FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL, NOT FROM ME OR FRANKLY ANYONE ELSE FROM WASHINGTON. THE BEAUTY OF THE PLANS IS WE ARE TRADING TO EMPOWER GREAT LOCAL TEACHERS AND  PRINCIPALS AND PARENTS AND SUPERINTENDENTS, TO PUT IN PLACE THEIR PLANS TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN. OUR CHALLENGE IS 44, 45 STATES, RURAL, URBAN, SUBURBAN, ANSWERS AREN'T GOING TO COME FROM US. THEY WILL COME IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.
Jon: DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT EDUCATION SUFFERS FROM IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT THE  PARADIGM NEEDS TO BE SHIFTED, THAT IT SEAMS THAT EDUCATION HAS BEEN CLOISTERED. AND NO LONGER HAS THE SHAME APPLICATION-- SAME APPLICATION TO THE MODERN WORLD. WE'RE STILL WORKING OFF OF THE PAST. AND TRYING TO FIX THINGS THAT ARE REALLY NOT APP RA PO IN TODAY'S --
I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS THAT WE HAVE BECOME TOO COMPLACENT. WE'RE 16th IN THE WORLD TODAY IN COLLEGE GRADUATES. A GENERATION AGO WE WERE FIRST. IT ISN'T THAT WE HAVE DROPPED. WE HAVE FLAT LINED IN 15 OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED US BY. WE HAVE TO EDUCATE OUR WAY TO A BETTER ECONOMY. THERE ARE 2 MILLION JOBS OUT THERE TODAY IN OUR COUNTRY THAT WE CAN'T FILL BECAUSE  WE DON'T HAVE THE EDUCATED WORKFORCE TO FILL THOSE JOBS. SO WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO.
WE HAVE A MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL EVERY YEAR, A MILLION, THERE ARE NO JOB, NONE, THEY ARE GUARANTEED POVERTY AND SOCIAL FAILURE. WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO, TAKE RISK AND DO THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY  BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH BAR. WE HAVE TO HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS.
Jon: I GUESS THE WAY YOU DEFINE THE BAR IS PROBABLY THE DIFFICULTY. CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR TWO SECONDS. CAN YOU STAY AFTER SCHOOL, AS IT WERE.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: SECRETARY ARNE DUNCAN, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS.
