(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW ON JULY 1 MEXICO ELECTED A NEW PRESIDENT, ENRIQUE KNEE YOU TOE, KICKING OFF THE BROAD  MEXICAN STREET PROTESTS OF VOTE RIGGING. BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN WRAPPED UP, WE SENT AL MADRIGAL TO LOOK ATING IN NOT SO TRADITIONAL
THE RECENT RACE PITTED THE PAWN PARTY AGAINST THE P.R.I. PARTY. THIS YEAR, MEXICO BANNED NEGATIVE POLITICAL ADS, JOURNALIST FERNANDO DORAT.
I TEND TO NOT LIKE, COMPETITIONS END TO TAKE PLEASURE. THIS IS NOT DEMOCRACY BECAUSE OF THE BAN.
SO YOU WANT NEGATIVE ADS?
NEGATIVE ADS ALLOW PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT OUR CANDIDATES ARE MADE OF.
THE T.V. AD BAN WAS PROTECTING THE MAJOR PARTIES FROM CRITICISM. VOTERS WERE LEFT TO JUDGE ON NOTHING BUT THE CANDIDATES' ABILITY TO STARE AT THE SUNRISE  OR WALK IN MANY DIFFERENT JACKETS. (LAUGHTER) MEXICO WAS JONESING FOR THE REAL STUFF. I SMELLED OPPORTUNITY. THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN AMERICA LETS US GROW TONS OF THIS NEGATIVE AD (BLEEP).
THAT'S NICE. INTERESTING.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I'M GOING TO GET YOU SOME NEGATIVE ADS. PURE, UNCUT. HUH?
(LAUGHS)
WELL, HERE IN MEXICO WE HAVE A...
(LAUGHS) ARE WE IN BUSINESS, MY FRIEND? NEXT, I RETURNED HOME TO GET MY HANDS ON THE GOOD STUFF. FLIP-FLOP, SWIFT BOAT, TINY GUY BIG TANK, LITTLE SUSIE APOCALYPSE. WHATEVER IT'S CALLED, THE UNITED STATES IS A PRIMO SOURCE. I MET WITH A WELL-KNOWN SUPPLIER. I NEED SOME NEGATIVE ADS.
THAT'S WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING. I'M HAPPY TO HELP.
HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE THE GUY?
WELL, CERTAINLY PEOPLE KNOW ME AS THE TERMINATOR.
WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME IS
HANK SHY SHANKOFF.
THE TERMINATOR'S NAME IS HANK SHANKOFF?
THAT'S ME.
NOW I CAN SEE WHY YOU'D PREFER TERMINATOR.
YOU HAVE OPPOSITION RESEARCH IN WHAT DO WE KNOW THAT'S BAD  ABOUT EACH OF THESE PEOPLE?
TIME TO GET THE DIRT ON FRONT-RUNNER PENA NIETO. TELL ME SOMETHING NEGATIVE ABOUT HIM?
WELL, HERE IN MEXICO HE'S KNOWN AS THE MALE BARBIE.
THE MALE BARBIE?
YES.
YOU KNOW THERE'S A NAME FOR THAT AND IT'S KEN. (LAUGHTER)
WHO'S KEN? (LAUGHTER)
MALE BARBIE IS KEN. DUDE, LET ME SHOW YOU HOW WE DO THIS IN AMERICA. HAS PENA NIETO EVER EATEN DOG OR PUT THEIR DOG ON TOP OF THEIR ROOF ON A ROAD TRIP? BECAUSE YOU CAN REALLY SPIN THAT.
NOBODY CARES.
DON'T (BLEEP) WITH ME. ARMED WITH BARELY ENOUGH INFO, TERMINATOR AND I GOT DOWN TO BUSINESS COOKING, DISTILLING AND SYNTHESIZING THE PERFECT HIT TEAM. AFTER A LOT OF HARD WORK AND A QUICK BREAK WE PUT OUR FIRST SAMPLE ON TO A FLASH DRIVE. YOU EVER SMUGGLE ANYTHING IN YOUR ASS BEFORE?
NEVER.
TOOTHBRUSH.
CAN'T YOU JUST PUT IN THE YOUR SUITCASE?
DON'T TELL ME HOW TO PACK. I TRAVEL A LOT. WITH CONTRABAND TOILETRIES AND A MAGAZINE TUCKED SECURELY AWAY I RETURNED TO MEXICO. LAUGH
THEY SAY YOU'RE A REALLY BAD MAN.
SOMETIMES IT TAKES A BAD MAN TO SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT BAD PEOPLE. WHICH ACTUALLY MAKES ME A GOOD PERSON. GO PLAY SOCCER OR IF YOU BELIEVE WHATEVER YOU GUYS CALL IT. TIME FOR THE BUY.
THAT'S FAR ENOUGH. YOU GOT THE MONEY?
WHAT MONEY?
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU TO BRING MONEY.
DAMN.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT ENRIQUE PENA NIETO? HE SAID HE'LL BE BUENO FOR MEXICO. DESTROYING MEXICO IS HIS GOOOOOL! GOOD (BLEEP), RIGHT?
NO, IT'S SO WRONG! MEXICO NEEDS ATTACKS ON CHARACTER, ATTACKS ON POLITICS, NOT JUST DIRT, NOT JUST IMAGES OR SOMBER MUSIC.
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE REALLY SCREWING ME HERE FERNANDO. I DON'T PUT STUFF UP MY BUTT LIGHTLY. GET OUT OF HERE. MEXICO NEVER GOT TO SEE MY ASS. AND TWO WEEKS LATER THE SPIDER WON THE ELECTION. LET'S HOPE THE GENERAL ELECTION GENERATION FIGURES OUT HOW A REAL DEMOCRACY WORKS. DESTROYING MEXICO IS HIS GOOOL!
