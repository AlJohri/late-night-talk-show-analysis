Jon: WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE IS PART TWO OF THE INTERVIEW WITH DON RUMSFELD. IT GOES FOR TWO AND A HALF DAYS. YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE REST OF IT ON THE WEB. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SHORT EDIT JUST AS HE SAYS, YOU'RE  RIGHT, WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE DONE IT AND -- SO I THEEP PLAYS. -- I HOPE THAT PLAYS. ENJOY. WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TALKING WITH DONALD RUMSFELD. I GUESS MY -- WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS THIS:  YOU HAD A MEMO OF PARADE OF HORRIBLES? IT WAS TWO OR THREE PAGES?
I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: IT WAS 30 OR 40 HORRIBLES.
POSSIBLE. I DIDN'T KNOW.
Jon: YOU DON'T KNOW IF THAT PARADE IS GOING TO HAPPEN. IT COULD BE THE PUERTO RICAN DAY PARADE. NOBODY KNOWS. [LAUGHTER] IT SEEMED THAT THE EFFORT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION EXUDED WAS MORE GEARED TOWARDS MAKING THE  CASE OF WHY WE HAD TO DO THIS THAN EXAMINING YOUR MEMO. YOU SAY YOURSELF IN THE BOOK, I GAVE THE MEMO TO THE NFC, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO IT.
NOT QUITE.
Jon: YOU GAVE THE MEMO TO THE NSC BUT THEY DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION.
INDIVIDUALS DID AND PEOPLE DID MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR SOME OF THOSE THINGS. CERTAINLY WE DID IN THE DEPARTMENT. THEY WERE NOT EXTENSIVE MEETINGS ON THEM.

I GUESS SO. I DON'T KNOW. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL. THE NSC MET FREQUENTLY.
Jon: DID THEY TELL YOU ANYTHING? YOU POOR MAN. ARE YOU NOT ON THE E-MAIL LIST? ARE YOU NOT CCED?
I WAS IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY.
Jon: THERE WAS A --
YOU DON'T NEED TO TELL ME.
Jon: YOU CREATED A WHOLE OFFICE TO DEAL WITH INTELLIGENCE WITHIN THE PENTAGON CALLED THE  OFFICE OF SPECIAL PLANS.
DID YOU KNOW THAT.
I DID NOT.
Jon: YOU RECOMMENDED IT?
NO.
Jon: DID YOU HAVE ANY POWER?
SURE, LOTS.
Jon: IF THEY SAID CAN WE CREATE A SPECIAL OFFICE?
THERE ARE THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN THAT OPERATION. EVERYONE DID NOT ASK ME EVERYTHING THEY WERE GOING TO DO THEY WERE DELEGATED LARGE CHUNKS  OF RESPONSIBILITY. THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE WHO DID A GOOD JOB.
Jon: LET'S NOT GET CRAZY. I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOU AT LEAST HAVING THE CONVERSATION AND HAVING AT LEAST THE ABILITY --
WHY DO YOU SAY AT LEAST TWICE? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NICELY DONE. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. [LAUGHTER] AND I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO AND YOUR TIME IS VALUABLE AND I DO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. "KNOWN AND UNKNOWN" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. DONALD RUMSFELD. SIR -- THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND
