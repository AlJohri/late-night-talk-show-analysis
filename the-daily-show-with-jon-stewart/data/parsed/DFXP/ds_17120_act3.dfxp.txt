(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE CREATOR OF FOX'S "FAMILY GUY" HIS NEW MOVIE ISED "TED."
OH...
MAURY, YOU'RE HOME EARLY.
THIS PLACE IS A WRECK, WHO ARE THESE GIRLS.
THEY'RE HOOKERS SO IT'S FINE.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
WHERE ARE MY MANNERS? LAURIE, THIS IS ANGELIQUE, HEAVENLY, SHARINE AND SOEFBIAN BLANK. SOMEWHERE OUT THERE I R FOUR TERRIBLE FATHERS I WISH I COULD THANK FOR THIS GREAT NIGHT. (APPLAUSE).
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME SETH McFARLANE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IS THIS FOR ME?
YEAH, THIS IS FOR YOU.
Jon: I'M DELIGHTED. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BROUGHT THE ACTOR FROM THE MOVIE. (LAUGHTER)
IT IS A GIFT FROM ME TO YOU, MY FRIEND.
Jon: WHAT IS THIS... NOW I HAVE CHILDREN. YOU MAY... PLEASE. TAKE YOUR SEAT. I HAVE CHILDREN OF THE AGE OF SEVEN AND SIX.
UH-HUH.
Jon: IS THERE ANYTHING THAT THIS SAYS THAT IS IN ANY WAY APPROPRIATE FOR THEM?
UM... IT SAYS ABOUT A DOZEN PHRASES AND MAYBE, LIKE, THREE OF THEM ARE OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT, SO ANY (BLEEP) RELATED...
HEY, JOHNNY, HOW ABOUT A BEER, HUH?
Jon: THAT'S FINE. JUST WHEN DADDY GETS HOME. SAME THING.
(LAUGHS) COME HERE YOU BASTARD.
Jon: O.K., COME HERE YOU BASTARD MIGHT NOT WORK.
I DON'T KNOW OW WHAT YOUR HOUSEHOLD IS LIKE. MAYBE IT'S FINE.
Jon: FILLED WITH BEER AND BASTARDS, QUITE FRANKLY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THIS IS A MESS.
Jon: OH, I'M SORRY. IS IT STILL THE MUSTARD. OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
THIS IS HORRIBLE.
Jon: WE'RE GOING TO BLEACH THAT CARPET. CAN I TELL YOU THE TRUTH? LAST NIGHT WE HAD ON SENATOR MARCO RUBIO FROM FLORIDA.
YES.
Jon: VERY DISTINGUISHED YOUNG GUN AND WE WERE GOING TO DO THE HOT DOG CIRCUMCISION  SQUIRTS OF MUSTARD BIT AND SOMEONE IN THE BACK HAD THE WHEREWITHAL TO SAY THAT WE  SHOULD NOT (BLEEP)ING DO THAT. (LAUGHTER) SO WE SAVED IT FOR SOMEONE WE FELT WOULD APPRECIATE IT, PERHAPS.
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE BACK OF MY CAR SO IT'S FINE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LOT OF HOT DOG CIRCUMCISIONS OUT THERE, NEW.
THAT WOULD BE TAKEN ANY NUMBER OF WAYS.
Jon: THAT REALLY COULD. HOW DO YOU HAVE ANY TIME... YOU HAVE, LIKE, FIVE SHOWS ON FOX. YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WITH YOUR FRIEND NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON ON NOVA. WHEN DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS MOVIE? HOW DID YOU EXECUTE IT? DID YOU DO IT ON WEEK STPHEPBDZ HOW DID THIS EVEN WORK?
I DID TAKE SOME TIME OFF FROM "FAMILY GUY" AND "AMERICAN DAD"  AND THE OTHER SHOWS TO DO THIS. IT WAS AN ANIMATED SERIES IDEA THAT I CAME UP WITH A WHILE BACK AND PUT IT ON HOLD FOR A NUMBER  OF REASONS AND WHEN IT CAME TIME TO DO A MOVIE THIS SEEMED LIKE A FUN PROJECT AND GUYS LIKE JAMES  CAMERON AND PETER JACKSON HAVE PERFECTED THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR... TO DO THESE INCREDIBLY LIFE LIKE CHARACTERS.
Jon: HUGE WAR SCENES. THE WHOLE EARTH IS IN BALANCE.
BLUE PEOPLE LOOK LIKE THEY'RE CHOKING AND SO IT'S... BUT NO  ONE HAS USED THE TECHNOLOGY FOR COMEDY AND I THOUGHT, WELL, GOD, WHERE ELSE...
Jon: NO ONE'S USED IT FOR A BEAR HAVING SEX WITH HOOKERS YET.
WELL, THAT, TOO. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW DO YOU... SO YOU CALL UP MARK WAHLBERG AND SAY, "HEY, MAN, I'VE GOT THIS IDEA FOR YOU AND THIS TEDDY BEAR." (LAUGHTER)
YEAH. YOU HAVE A LOT OF DRINKS BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT CALL. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DOES HE... DOES HE CALL YOU BACK AND GO "I'VE READ  THIS, IT SPEAKS TO ME"? (LAUGHTER) WHAT DOES HE SAY?
Jon: HE SOUNDS THAT MUCH LIKE CLINT EASTWOOD ON THE PHONE.
Jon: (LAUGHS)
HE WAS INTO IT. I THINK... HE CLAIMS HE CAME INTO IT WITH TREPIDATION AND THAT HE WAS, FOR BETTER OR  WORSE, TRUSTING ME AND IT PAID OFF. IF IT DIDN'T, I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW. I'D PROBABLY BE BLOODIED AND BEAT ON THE A PULP. NO, HE'S A PEACEFUL GUY.
Jon: BUT THIS GUY, NO.
NO. THIS IS THE GUY YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.
Jon: THERE IS NO REASON THAT I AS A GROWN MAN APPROACHING VERY RAPIDLY 50  YEARS ON THIS EARTH SHOULD WATCH MARK WAHLBERG HAVE A FISTFIGHT WITH A TEDDY BEAR AND LAUGH HELPLESSLY. AND YET THAT'S WHAT I FOUND MYSELF DOING. I FOUND MYSELF JUST RERACKING AND WATCHING OVER AND OVER OF THEM HAVING A FISTFIGHT.
THE GOAL FOR THAT SCENE WAS TO PLAY IT AS REALISTICALLY AS  IF YOU WERE WATCHING "THE BOURNE IDENTITY." (LAUGHTER) WE SAID... WE TALKED TO MARK, THE STUNT GUYS, WE SAID THIS HAS GOT TO BE VERY SERIOUS. AND WAHLBERG PULLED IT OFF."
Jon: SO YOU GO IN AND YOU'RE LIKE "MARK, THIS BEAR KILLED YOUR FAMILY."  (LAUGHTER)
EXACTLY.
Jon: THIS IS YOUR ONE CHANCE AT REVENGE!
AND WE GOT WHAT WE GOT.
Jon: NOW YOU'RE USED TO WORKING WITH VOICE ACTORS, YOU GUYS DO LIVE STAGE STUFF. BUT ACTUALLY DOING THIS WITH LIFE ACTORS, DID YOU FIND YOURSELF GOING LIKE OH, WHAT IF  WE DROPPED A PIANO ON HIM AND THEN WE'RE LIKE "OH, RIGHT, HE'S ALIVE!"
I'M USED TO WORKING WITH CHARACTERS WHO WON'T GET DRUNK  AND GO OFF ON RANTS ABOUT THE JEWS, YES. (LAUGHTER) YOU'VE GOT TO BE MORE CAREFUL WITH LIVE ACTORS BECAUSE THEY... (LAUGHTER). BECAUSE SOMETIMES THAT CAN HAPPEN.
Jon: THAT CAN HAPPEN. I DO NOT SEE THAT COMING BUT OKAY.
I...
Jon: SO YOU DIDN'T GO AFTER GIBSON ON THIS FIRST.
, NO I DIDN'T GO AFTER GIBSON.
Jon: WELL, IT'S HIGH LAIRS YOU, EXCELLENT WORK. I GUESS NOW YOU GO BACK TO YOUR DAY JOB BUT VERY EXCITING. "TED" IS IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY. SETH McFARLANE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
