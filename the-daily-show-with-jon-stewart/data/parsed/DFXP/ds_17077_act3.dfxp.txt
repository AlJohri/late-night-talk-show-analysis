[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. A FORMER NEWSPAPER REPORTER AND NOW THE NEWS EDITOR FOR DOINGSTER.COM HER NEW BOOK IS  CALLED "SOLDIER DOGS" PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MARIA GOODAVAGE. NICE TO SIGH. PLEASE SIT. DID I PRONOUNCE THAT RIGHT?
THAT WAS GOOD.
Jon: IS THAT RIGHT?
CLOSE ENOUGH.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. SOLDIER DOG -- FIRST OF ALL, KIND OF AN ADORABLE PICTURE. BUT YOU REALLY DON'T ACTUALLY HEAR -- DOGS HAVE QUITE AN IMPORTANT ROLE ON THE FRONTLINES  OF THE FIGHT.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF ROLES ACTUALLY. THE BIGGEST ONE RIGHT NOW IN AFGHANISTAN IS GOING OUT IN FRONT OF THE TROOPS AND SNIFFING  OUT IEDS AND THEY LEAD THE WAY. THEY SAVE LIVES EVERY DAY BECAUSE THEIR NOSES ARE SO AMAZING. SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE THERE.
EACH ONE HAS A HANDLER. EACH ONE HAS AN ASSIGNED INDIVIDUAL THAT TRAINS THEM OR JUST CARES FOR THEM?
THEY DON'T TRAIN THEM. THEY ARE TRAINED AT LACKLAND AIR FORCE BASE, MOST OF THEM, THEY GO THROUGH MONTHS OF TRAINING  ONCE THEY GET TO THE HOME BASE THEY MEET THE HANDLER. THEY HANG OUT FOR MONTHS WITH THE HANDLER AND EVENTUALLY DEPLOY TOGETHER. THEY GO THROUGH SEVEN MONTHS TOGETHER AND THEY COME BACK TOGETHER. IT'S A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING. PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE LEFT THERE. THEY COME BACK. THEY ARE --
Jon: THEY COME BACK WITH THE HANDLER. THAT'S A TRAINING EXERCISE, YES?
THAT SAY TRAINING EXERCISE AND THAT'S MILITARY WORKING DOG  IN YUMA, ARRESTS, WHICH THEY CALL AFGHANISTAN U.S.A. YOU HAVE TO CARRY YOUR DOG. IF YOUR DOG IS INJURED AND YOU HAVE TO GO OVER A WALL AND YOUR DOG CAN'T CLIMB A WALL. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A SMALLER DOG THAN TINA.
THEY HAVE REALLY SMALL DOGS. SHOW THE ONES IN THE SUBMARINES. THERE YOU GO. THIS IS LARS.
Jon: SETTLE DOWN. HE'S WORKING. DON'T A, WWW HIM. [ LAUGHTER ]
HE HAS A NAPOLEON COMPLEX.
Jon: I DON'T BLAME HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] BEEN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, HE DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB. ACE BOMB SNIFFER. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A DRUG SNIFFER AND GOT INTO THE WRONG PROGRAM AT DOG SCHOOL. HE SNIFFS OUT BOMBS AND SUBMARINES.
Jon: DOES THAT HAPPEN AT A LOT OF DOG SCHOOLS? WAIT, I WAS A HELPER MONKEY NOW I'M HERE IN A MINE -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. I NOTICE A LOT OF SHEPHERDS.
AND THE BIG ONE TOLD IS THE BELGIAN MALOMAR. YOU HEARD OF DOG IN THE BIN LADEN RAID.
Jon: YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY YOU'VE HEARD OF BELGIUM. YEAH, I HEARD OF IT.
THAT WAS THE DOG IN THAT RAID. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE DID.
Jon: I HOPE HE URINATED ALL OVER THE PLACE. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST TO ADD A LITTLE INSULT TO INJURY. [ LAUGHTER ] THESE DOGS, HOW DO THEY -- TRAIN THEM TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND -- THESE CONDITIONS IN AFGHANISTAN  ARE ABSOLUTELY SO DIFFICULT FOR EVEN HUMANS TO UNDERSTAND. THEY GET PTSD? HOW DOES A DOG NOT? MINE GET IT FROM THE IS VACUUM CLEANER. HOW DO THEY GET THE DOGS TO NOT RESPOND TO THAT? OR DO THEY GET ISSUES?
THEY TRY TO BUY RESILIENT DOGS AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT DOG IS GETTING PTSD. THEY RECOGNIZED IT'S REAL UNTIL DOGS. THEY ARE DOING RESEARCH, DRUG THERAPY, BEHAVIORAL THERAPY BUT A QUARTER OF DOGS DIAGNOSED WILL  NEVER GO OUT AGAIN AND THEY ARE ADOPTED. I MET ONE AT THE KENNEL. ALL THE DOGS WERE BARKING AND TWIRLING AND THIS DOG, A LITTLE BROWN LAB WAS CURLED UP IN A  BALL STEARG OUT INTO SPACE. I SAID WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS DOG? HE THEY SAID HE DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT OF AFGHANISTAN. HE IS IN TEXAS NOW WITH A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE AND THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO  HELP HIM OVERCOME THAT.
Jon: WHEN YOU SAID THAT, I REALLY HOPE PUPS JUST DID THIS -- BUCK JUST DID THIS --  THEY ARE HEROIC BUT HEARTBREAKING STORIES BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE  HANDLER AND THEIR DOGS. IT REALLY IS A BOND THAT IS ALMOST MORE INTENSE THAN BETWEEN TROOP MATES.
IT'S TRUE. AND THE HANDLER-DOG BOND GOES SO DEEP. A LOT OF HANDLERS SAY I'M CLOSER TO MY DOG THAN MY SPOUSE. THEY ARE TOGETHER 24/7. THEIR LIVES DEPENDEN OUGHT DOGS.
Jon: SO REX BEFORE WE GO. THERE YOU GO.
REX AND HAZE HANDLER.
Jon: IT'S A TOUGH STORY. THEY STARTED OUT NOT GETTING ALONG. REX WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ANYONE. AT THE END THEY BONDED SO DEEPLY AND IT WAS -- I TALKED TO THE HANDLER.
Jon: AND THEY NEVER GET OVER IT.
SHE'S STILL NOT OVER IT.
Jon: IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY. THESE ARE DOGGLES THEY WEAR. YOU SHOULD WEAR THIS WHEN YOU READ THE BOOK BECAUSE THEY'LL FILL UP WITH SALINE. IT'S AN EMOTIONAL BOOK. WONDERFUL STORIES TO TELL. IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. MARIA GOODAVAGE THANK YOU SO
