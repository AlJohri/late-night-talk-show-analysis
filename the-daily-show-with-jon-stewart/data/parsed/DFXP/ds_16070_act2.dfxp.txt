Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A BESTSELLING AUTHOR. HE'S A PRIZE-WINNING JOURNALIST. HE HOSTS "BILL MOYERS JOURNAL." HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "BILL  MOYERS JOURNAL: THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES. " PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM BILL MOYERS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO NICE TO SEE YOU. AND YOU TOO.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR COMING BY. I WAS READING. IT'S SO NICE TO READ THE INTERVIEWS THAT ARE COMPILED IN THIS BECAUSE IT REMINDS YOU OF  JUST WHAT A GREAT VOICE YOU ARE ON TELEVISION, AND IT'S, YOU KNOW, PARDON ME, AND I KNOW THAT  YOU'LL BE UNCOMFORTABLE DOING THIS, BUT WHAT'S SO NICE ABOUT  YOUR INTERVIEWS IS THEY PROVIDE CONTEXT BUT NOT AMNESTY. THEY HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO BRING OUT THE LAYERS OF A STORY, BUT NOT TO EXCUSE  ANYTHING ELSEMENT AND YOU MAY JUST NOD IF YOU WANT. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. SO WHAT'S YOUR... WHEN YOU APPROACH AN INTERVIEW, WHAT'S  YOUR... WHAT'S YOUR PREPARATION LIKE?
WELL, FIRST MY FOLKS AND I TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPORTANT AND THE  IMMEDIATE BECAUSE THE IMMEDIATE IS NOT ALWAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT. AND WHO CAN SPEAK TO WHAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT? WE DO A LOT OF RESEARCH, A LOT OF READING, A LOT OF TALKING AND ALL OF THAT. YOU KNOW... [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M GOING TO PUT STAR BY THAT.
I DON'T THINK YOU TOLD YOUR FRIENDS HERE ABOUT THE FIRST INTERVIEW. BECAUSE I'M A PRETTY GOOD CHOICE. THE FIRST INTERVIEW IN THIS BOOK IS WHO BUT YOU AND I HAVING A i>M9YTHAT'S FIRST ONE.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT DREW MY EYE TO THE BOOK. [LAUGHTER]
WELL, WE STARTED NOT NECESSARILY WITH THE SMARTEST, BUT WITH THE MOST...
Jon: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [AUDIENCE REACTS] HE'S RIGHTS. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. WHEN YOU SAY "THE MOST IMPORTANT," THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT IS MISSING FROM TODAY'S  JOURNALISM INTERVIEWS, A SENSE OF EDITORIAL AUTHORITY AND THE COURAGE TO EXERCISE IT.
WELL, IT'S YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT. YOU HAVE TO BRING THAT TO BEAR ON YOUR CHOICES. YOU HAVE TO DECIDE, THIS IS WHAT I THINK IS GOOD, IS WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT, AND THEN STAND BY IT. YOU HAVE TO DOCUMENT IT. YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT YOUR AUTHORITY IS CREDIBLE, THAT IT'S JUSTIFIED. I LEARNED A LOT. I DON'T FOLLOW SPORTS VERY MUCH, BUT I LEARNED A LOT FROM THE GREAT ONE OF HOCKEY, WAYNE GRETZKY. YOU REMEMBER THAT HE SAID HIS STRATEGY WAS ALWAYS TO GO WHERE THE PUCK WAS HEADING, NOT WHERE  IT IS. HE READ THE GAME, AS SOMEBODY SAID, IN MAGNIFICENT WAY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE JOURNALISTS SHOULD TRY TO DO, TRY TO SEE WHERE THE PUCK, THE NEWS, THE  EVENTS ARE GOING. AND TO BE THERE WHEN IT HAPPENS SO WE CAN PUT IT IN CONTEXT. AND WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU GAIN A CERTAIN AUTHORITY FROM BEING RIGHT MORE OFTEN THAN WRONG.
Jon: DO YOU THINK JOURNALISM IS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE IT'S LOST THAT AUTHORITY, THE  WILL TO EXERCISE THAT AUTHORITY, THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE THAT AUTHORITY? WHAT'S... WHERE WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST LAPSE THAT YOU SEE?
I THINK WE'RE LOST IN WHAT... I BELIEVE IT WAS WHITMAN OR THOROUGH CALLED THE MERE SMOKE OF OPINION. THE NEWS IS ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KEEP HITTING. EVERYTHING ELSE IS PUBLICITY. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO KEEP THEIR OPINIONS HIDDEN. THEY WANT TO KEEP THE FACTS HIDDEN. IT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY, A LOT OF TIME, A LOT OF EFFORT TO EXPLORE THE FACTS AND BRING THEM OUT. SO A LOT OF NEWS ORGANIZATIONS NO LONGER DO MUCH REPORTING. THEY SIMPLY RELY ON OPINION, TALK, ALL OF, THAT AND THAT UNDERMINES JOURNALISM. THE OTHER THING IS WE ARE ABUSING OURSELVES TO DEATH. IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT TODAY. JON JON I SHOULD JUST GO. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]
YOU ACTUALLY ENTERTAIN?
Jon:, NO NOT REALLY. EVERY NOW AND AGAIN.
THE REASON YOU'RE FIRST IN THE BOOK IS PEOPLE SAID, WHY DO  YOU HAVE JON STEWART ON THE SHOW. YOU WERE FIRST ON MY SHOW WHEN I CAME BACK TO PBS IN 2007. AND I SAID, WELL, BECAUSE MARK TWAIN WASN'T AVAILABLE AND HE'S NOT. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, YOUR PEOPLE HERE KNOW THAT THE TRUTH GOES DOWN BETTER IN A DEMOCRACY WHEN IT'S IN HUMOR, BUT YOU DO A SPLENDID JOB OF JUXTAPOSING. YOU DON'T ATTACK PEOPLE. YOU PUT WHAT THEY SAID TEN YEARS AGO AND WHAT THEY SAID LAST NIGHT. THAT'S WHAT GOOD JOURNALISM IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT COMPARING. IT'S NOT DECLARING IT.
Jon: WELL, THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT TO DYE THAT MAN'S MUSTACHE, BUT THANK  YOU FOR PUTTING US IN THE SAME SENTENCE. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL
