WELL, IT'S WEDNESDAY. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? TIME FOR OUR OCCUPY WALL STREET ROUND-UP. HOW ARE THINGS GOING AMONGST THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST OUR NATION'S  WEALTH INEQUALITY? OH, NEW YORK, ADORABLE. PHILLY, GOING VERY WELL DOWN. THERE CINCINNATI, THE QUEEN CITY. OH, WASHINGTON, D.C., SO NICE THEY WON'T LET US JOIN THE UNION. AND OAKLAND, HOW ARE THINGS --  [LAUGHTER] [BLEEPED] HAPPENED IN OAKLAND? DIDN'T YOU GUYS HEAR THE BUCOLIC BUGS BUNNY WAKE-UP MUSIC? WHAT'S GOING ON, OAKLAND? CHILL OUT. VERY SLOWLY, TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY WERE THERE FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS. THINGS WERE PRETTY MUCH PEACEFUL DURING THAT PERIOD. AND THEN POLICE SAW THE SITUATION DETERIORATING IN TERMS OF A PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT. THEY SAW HEALTH CONDITIONS GETTING BAD, SO THEY DECIDED TO GET RID OF THOSE PROTESTERS TO  TELL THEM TO DISBAND.
Jon: SO THE CITY WAS CONCERNED ABOUT A PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT, SO THEY DID THIS. [GUNFIRE] SEEMS A LITTLE HEAVY HANDED. UNLESS WAS ONE OF THE PROTESTERS GODZILLA? [LAUGHTER] THAT WOULD JUSTIFY AN ATTACK. NOT THAT THERE WEREN'T RUFFIANS OUT THERE. OKAY. THAT KID LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE. I BET THAT PROFESSOR'S CLASS IS DULL. OH, ARE YOU [BLEEPED] KIDDING ME? THAT GUY WAS A PUBLIC MENACE? WHAT DO YOU THINK, THAT CHAIR COMES ON RAMMING SPEED IN COME ON. LOOK, I KNOW A SELF-SELECTED GROUP OF PEOPLE CAN'T TAKE OVER PUBLIC SPACE FOREVER. IT'S PUBLIC SPACE. IT'S FOR EVERYONE, INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO DON'T CONSIDER DRUM  CIRCLES TO BE SLEEPY TIME MUSIC, BUT SEEMS TO ME THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LESS... [ISMTATES MACHINE-GUN FIRE] WAY OF RESOLVING THIS. IF YOU DON'T WANT THE PROTESTERS TO OCCUPY THAT SPACE BECAUSE  IT'S ACROSS FROM CITY HALL, YOU KNOW, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS, I'M  SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF NICE PUBLIC AREAS. JACK LONDON SQUARE RIGHT THERE, BOOM. POPULAR AREA DOWN BY THE WATER FRONGTD. MAYBE THAT. WHAT ABOUT THE OAKLAND COLISEUM. IT'S OCTOBER. YOU KNOW THE A'S AREN'T GOING TO BE USING IT. BOOM! BOOM! BASEBALL SLAM. [APPLAUSE] DID I JUST TEAR MY ROTATOR CUFF MAKING A JOKE? LISTEN, OAKLAND, I KNOW YOU WANT TO KEEP THE PEACE WHILE RESPECTING PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO  ASSEMBLE, BUT IT'S HARD TO WATCH YOUR REACTION TO THIS GROUP OF PROTESTERS WITH THE TEAR GAS  WHEN EVERY SUNDAY YOU HOST AN OCCUPATION FOR THESE FOLKS. THE MAD MAX RE-ENACTORS CLUB, BECAUSE BELIEVE ME, THEY START PEEING IN PUBLIC, A LOT SOONER THAN THOSE OTHER PROTESTERS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
