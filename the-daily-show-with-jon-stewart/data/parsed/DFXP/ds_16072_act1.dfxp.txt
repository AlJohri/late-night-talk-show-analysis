JUNE 6, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT, PEOPLE. OH, WE'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT PAST MAZIAR BAHARI WILL BE JOINING US. THESE ARE INCREDIBLE TIMES. IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT PART OF THE WORLD THERE IS OPPRESSION, INSTABILITY, UNSPEAKABLE VIOLENCE. AND YET THE DREAM OF FREEDOM LIVES ON. IT'S THE TYPE OF STORY THAT YOU, OUR VIEWERS, DESERVE. NAY, NEED. TO HEAR MORE ABOUT. UNFORTUNATELY (BEEP) 2011. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  IT BETTER BE HIS SHOULDER. (BEEP N (2011 HAS NOT RUN ITS COURSE. IT'S GETTING THERE. FOR THE UNINITIATED, THIS PHOTO WAS RAN SAYING IT WAS SENT FROM ANTHONY WEINER'S ACCOUNT. THE CONGRESSMAN SUGGESTED HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT HAD BEEN HACKED. HE SAID HE COULD NOT VERIFY WITH CERTITUDE OR SURENESS. THIS IS WHERE THE STORY STOOD UNTIL TODAY WHEN A NEW PHOTO WAS RELEASED THAT THE  CONGRESSMAN (BEEP) APPARENTLY TOOK OF HIM. WOW. THAT IS SOME CLEAVAGE. CAN WE ZOOM IN ON THAT ANY CHANCE? IS THERE ANYWAY TO....
I'M IN THE CANYON.
Jon: FRANK OH, I KNEW IT. SO THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S SEGMENT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I WISH YOU GUYS CHECKED WITH  ME BEFORE YOU ANYWAY, YOU KNOW WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST UPSETTING THING, THE MOST  UPSETTING THING ABOUT HAVING A FRIEND CAUGHT UP IN A SCANDAL OF THIS NATURE IS FINDING OUT, A, HE'S PACKING JUMBO HEAT. AND, B, THAT HE'S RIPPED. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GUY AND I ARE THE SAME (BEEP) AGE. THAT'S MY PROBLEM. HERE'S A PICTURE OF ME FROM THIS MORNING. I MEAN, GOOD, HOW GOOD IS THE CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH CARE PLAN? ANYWAY TODAY WORD ON THE WEBB WAS HASH TAG PLENTY MORE WHERE THIS CAME FROM. CONGRESSMAN WEINER SCHEDULED A PRESS CONFERENCE FOR 4:00. I DECIDED TO TUNE IN. AND ANDREW BREITBART THE OWNER OPERATOR OF THE WEBSITE BIG GOVERNMENT WAS IN THE  NEIGHBORHOOD IN NEW YORK CITY, SHOWED UP AND TOOK OVER WEINER'S PRESS CONFERENCE.
I'D LIKE AN APOLOGY FROM HIM. I'M HERE FOR SOME VINDICATION.
Jon: THIS IS THE WEIRDEST (BEEP) STORY I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. OR THE GREATEST EPISODE OF MAURY EVER. SO, AFTER BREITBART'S 4:00 P.M. PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WAS FOR CONGRESSMAN WEINER, IT WAS  TIME FOR CONGRESSMAN WEINER'S POST BREITBART PRESS CONFERENCE.
I HAVE MADE TERRIBLE MISTAKES. I'VE HURT THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT THE MOST AND I AM DEEPLY SORRY.
Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT. AT 4:25 EASTERN STANDARD TIME THIS STORY OFFICIALLY BECAME SAD. YOU KNOW, WE FORGET SOMETIMES... I CERTAINLY DO-- THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE HUMAN. AND THAT'S THE LESSON THAT IS GOING TO STAY WITH ME. UNTIL I TURN BACK TO THE CAMERA OVER THERE AND DO A LITTLE BIT ON THE JOHN EDWARDS' STORY. ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE. IT'S KILLING ME. SO REMEMBER THIS GUY? HE LOST THE PRESIDENCY. HE LOST THE VICE PRESIDENCY. HE WENT ON TELEVISION, LIED ABOUT HAVING AN AFFAIR, AND HE WENT ON TELEVISION AND  ADMITTED THE AFFAIR BUT LIED ABOUT HAVING A BABY WITH THE AFFAIR. YOU KNOW, IT SEEMED LIKE JOHN EDWARDS HAD IT ALL. THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT. CAN WE SCROLL THE PROMPTER. AH! THANK YOU. IT SEEMED LIKE JOHN EDWARDS COULDN'T SINK ANY LOWER. THANK YOU. MY FAULT. WELL, GUESS WHAT.
AN ARREST WARRANT WAS ISSUED TODAY FOR FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOHN  EDWARDS AFTER HIS INDICTMENT ON CRIMINAL CHARGES.
Jon: APPARENTLY HE'S GOING TO JAIL ON CHARGES OF GRAND LARCENY BECAUSE THAT BEAUTIFUL  HEAD OF HAIR JUST STOLE MY HEART. SO WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, EDWARDS IS BEING ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY... (LAUGHING) REALLY? (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WE DID THAT AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT. NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING SARCASTIC. EDWARDS IS BEING ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY USING NEARLY A MILLION DOLLARS IN CAMPAIGN  FUNDS TO KEEP HIS MISS STRESS OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE. IT TURNS OUT GOVERNMENT HAS A PRETTY WEAK CASE AGAINST HIM AND HE HAS SURPRISING ALLIES  SUPPORTING THAT NOTION.
EVEN SOME WHO FIND EDWARDS' BEHAVIOR DESPICABLE QUESTION THE STRENGTH OF THIS CASE.
I THINK HE'S A REPREHENSIBLE PERSON BUT NOT EVERY SCUM OR LIAR IS A CRIMINAL.
I THINK JOHN EDWARDS IS A LOUSY HUMAN BEING BUT I THINK THIS IS A REALLY LOUSY AND  FLIMSY CRIMINAL CASE.
Jon: THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT. NO, NO, NO, LET ME CONTINUE. I BELIEVE IN YOUR INNOCENCE BUT YOU ARE, IF I MAY, A PIECE OF (BEEP) TOOK A (BEEP) AND  THEN THAT (BEEP) THREW UP. AND THAT THROW-UP THEN TOOK A (BEEP), THAT IS YOU. ALTHOUGH YOU ARE PERFECTLY WITHIN YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS TO BE (BEEP).
