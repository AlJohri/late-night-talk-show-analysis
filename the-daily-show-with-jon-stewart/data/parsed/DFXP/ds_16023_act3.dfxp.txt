[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT THE ANCHOR AND MANAGING EDITOR OF NBC NIGHTLY NEWS. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM BRIAN WILLIAMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
Jon: WHAT IS UP?
NOT MUCH, MY FRIEND. HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: I'M VERY WELL, THANK YOU. GOOD THAT YOU ARE BACK FROM EGYPT SAFE AND SOUND. THAT SEEMED LIKE -- WAS THAT THE HAIRIEST SITUATION THAT YOU'VE BEEN IN AS AN ANCHOR?
IT HAD ELEMENTS OF THE DAY KATRINA WENT SOUR AND BECAME DANGEROUS. IT HAD ELEMENTS OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. WE PWRAULT NO BODY ARMOR. WE BROUGHT SECURITY WITH US BUT THEY WERE UNARMED BECAUSE THE GUN LAWS, ODDLY, IN EGYPT ARE STRICT. I MADE EYE CONTACT WITH THE GUY ON THE LEAD HORSE.
Jon: THE GUY WITH THE WHIPS.
AFTER I SAW HIM THEY PULLED OUT WHIPS AND STARTED BEATING HUMAN BEINGS.
Jon: WHAT IS THE ARMY DOING AT THAT POINT? THE GUYS ARE COMING THROUGH WITH HORSES AND WHIPS. YOU HAVE TANKS THERE. THEY ARE GOING LITERALLY MEDIEVAL ON YOU.
THAT IS SOMETHING OF A CANARD. THE ARMY WAS NOT READY TO DO ANY URBAN ENVIRONMENT FIRING. THEY ARE ON TANKS AND ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS. YOU DON'T WANT THEM DISCHARGING WEAPONS IN THAT ENVIRONMENT AND  THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH OF THEM TO SUPPRESS THIS.
Jon: THEY KNEW IT WAS COMING. DO YOU THINK THEY KNEW?
I DON'T THINK SO.
Jon: THEY WERE ORGANIZED.
THEY DID BUT THEY CAME FROM THE SUBURBS.
Jon: FROM THE SUBURBS LIKE THE WHITE KIDS FROM THE SUBURBS. THEY GO TO A CRACKHOUSE THEY MESS IT UP.
THEY CAME IN ALONG THE NILE RIVER ALONG A PROMENADE. THEY MARCHED WITH BANNERS. I HEARD DRUMS THAT MORNING. IT WAS A DIFFERENT DAY BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMETHING BECOME SO GOD AWFUL SOUR AND TOXIC SO QUICKLY. IT WENT FROM CAIRO THE BIG CELEBRATION TO DON'T LEAVE YOUR HOTEL.
Jon: THOSE ARE THE DAYS WE'RE HAPPY FOR THE GREEN SCREEN.
I NOTICED THAT AS SOON AS THIS BROKE OUT AND NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN, A LOT OF US HEADED  FOR KAY ROW AND YOU HEADED FOR VACATION. WHAT IS THAT?
Jon: I WAS AT DISNEY WORLD AT THE TIME.
OKAY.
Jon: I SAW IT ON TV AND I THOUGHT THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING.
I'M NOT EVEN GOING BACK TO NEW YORK. YOU THOUGHT NEW YORK WOULD BE UNSAFE TAP POINT -- AT THAT POINT SO YOU STAYED AT DISNEY.
Jon: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WAS SAFING THE PETER PAN RIDE. THAT'S WHAT I WENT ON. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT COULD TURN AT ANY POINT. YOU HAVE PEOPLE THERE HOPPED UP ON TURKEY LEGS. THERE[LAUGHTER] THERE COULD BE THAT MOMENT WHERE THEY LOOK DOWN AND SAY, MY GOD, CAPTAIN HOOK. THE WHOLE PLACE DISSOLVES TO GOD KNOWS WHAT. YEAH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NO, I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THIS TO YOU AND I SAY THIS. THERE'S AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REAL JOURNALISTS THAT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE AND  COVER THESE TYPES OF STORIES AND PEOPLE WHO SIT IN THE COMFORT OF THEIR OWN STUDIO AND MAKE FUN OF  THEM MERCILESSLY. I HAVE ALWAYS SAID TO YOU IT'S SO MUCH BETTER TO BE ON THE FUN-MAKING SIDE. [LAUGHTER]
I WOULD LIKE SO MUCH TO TAKE YOU ON ONE OF OUR TRIPS.
Jon: NO! I DON'T WANT TO GO.
WE GO TO GREAT PLACES.
Jon: THIS IS AN INTERESTING POINT THOUGH. ISN'T IT FRUSTRATING FOR YOU AS A NEWSMAN. WE'RE ALWAYS REACTING TO STORIES. EGYPT COMES. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THERE SAID YOU COULD SEE IT COMING FOR YEARS. THEN IT EXPLODES AND EVERYONE HAS TO FLY IN. THE INFRASTRUCTURE DOESN'T EXIST, THE RELATIONSHIPS ON THE GROUND DON'T EXIST AND IT PUTS  YOU GUYS AT A DISADVANTAGE AND MAKE MAKES IT MORE DANGEROUS FOR YOU THAT THE NEWS BUDGETS ARE  CUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FOREIGN ARMS WE USED TO HAVE.
CAN I PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.
Jon: NO, YOU MUST AGREE. [LAUGHTER]
WE FLEW IN AND WORKED OUT OF CAIRO BUREAU WHERE IT'S UP AND FUNCTIONING 24/7. WE FLEW IN WITH RICHARD ENGEL WHO LIVED AND WORKED THERE.
Jon: YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH THE NBC NEWS EXPENDITURE FOR INTERNATIONAL NEWS AND WHAT THEY  PUT OUT THERE? YEAH, I THINK IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF VIEWERS IN THE WORLD WE COVER, ESPECIALLY POST 9/11. THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR BROADCAST THAT IS FOREIGN NEWS IS UNBELIEVABLE. THIS HAS BEEN THE LEAD STORY 20 DAYS RUNNING. IT'S PART HUMAN NATURE. I CAN TELL YOU ALL I WANT TO LOOK ATMEN, TO WATCH -- YEMEN TO WATCH OUT FOR BAHRAIN AND LOOK  OUT FOR LIBYA BUT WE'RE GOING TO PAY ATTENTION.
Jon: YOU DO DO THAT. I KNOW THE MESSAGES YOU LEAVE ME ON THE PHONE, SOMETIMES. JON, LOOK OUT FOR ABOUT BAHRAIN. I CALL YOU BACK AND SAY, PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT CALL ME. [LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID THAT I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU KNOWING SOMETHING BUT.
Jon: YES.
I GOT THESE. WITHOUT THEM I'M A GUY THAT FAILED TO COMPLETE MY STUDIES AT BROOKDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN  NEW JERSEY BUT WITH THEM I WENT TO THE IVY LEAGUE.
HOLD I'M, I'M GOING TO DO TRY SOMETHING NEW. THE GLASSES ARE A TREK ASSET. WATCH THIS. GET ME PARKER DOWN AT THE PHOTO DESK. OH, OH, LOOK AT THIS. HOW (bleep) AM I? LOOK AT THAT?
THAT'S A DOUBLE BARREL.
Jon: I'M GOING DOUBLE PENS. LET ME GET THAT DOWN.
THAT'S GOOD. I STILL SAY GET YOU SOME TRI FOCALS AND A NICE HORN RIM, IF I CAN SELL YOU ON THAT. WORTH 75IQ POINTS.
Jon: YOU HAVE STIESM WE'VE HEARD THE FREEDOM AGENDA AND ALL. THIS SUDDENLY WE SEE IT IN EGYPT AND PEOPLE ARE BACK PEDALING LIKE, WHOA, ARE THESE GUYS OKAY  FOR DEMOCRACY TREATING FREEDOM LIKE NUKE LAR WEAPONS. IRAN CAN'T HAVE A NUCLEAR BOMB AND EGYPT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN HAVE DEMOCRACY.
I LOVE THAT WE'RE THE ARBITER OF WHO CAN HAVE THESE WEAPONS. AND IN STATE DEPARTMENT TALK WHO CAN HANDLE THE FREEDOM. FRIDAY THERE'S A PEOPLE'S RALLY IN CAIRO IN PART TO REMIND THE  MILTMILITARY THAT WE DID THIS. IT'S REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING. THE ONLY THING WE'RE HEARING IS THAT THE MILITARY HASN'T BEEN  TRANSPARENT, THEY HAVEN'T NAMED CITIZENS HELPING IN THE GOVERNING OF. THIS THEY SAY THE PRIORITY IS TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. EVERYONE'S VOICE IS FREE. THEY WERE PROTESTING THIS PAST WEEKEND "WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS  DOESN'T COME IN A MEDIUM?"
Jon: I SAID I WANTED A TOY WITH THIS MEAL!
WE HAVE TO HOPE FOR A BRIGHT FUTURE. NEXT TIME WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD. HOW IS THAT FOR A TEASE, HUH?
Jon: WHAT AM I A SPANISH SOAP OPERA? NEXT TIME WE FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS.
YOU START DOING THE --
Jon: THERE'S GIBBERISH. YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO, IT'S THE TRADITIONAL YOUR SEGMENT IS OVER. OUT COMES THE CARD YOU NERVOUSLY TAP AGAINST THE DESK. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE DONE THIS?
Jon: I HAVE A STALKER. [LAUGHTER] GOOD G- TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND. BRIAN WILLIAMS, EVERYBODY. [CHEE
