( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, THE WAR, THE WAR ON CHRISTIANITY HAS TAKEN MANY POURS. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DISCOVERS AN ENEMY WITHIN. SAM BEE HAS HEAR.
NUNS-- FOR YEARS NUN-STREAM MEDIA CONVINCED THE WORLD THEY  WERE HARMLESS LEVITATING SCAMPS, BUT IT TURNS OUT, THEY HAD US ALL FOOLED.
THE VATICAN IS ACCUSING THE LARGEST ORGANIZATION OF CATHOLIC  NUNS IN AMERICA OF FALLING OUT OF LINE WITH CHURCH TEACHINGS AND PROMOTING RADICAL FEMINIST THEMES.
BUT SISTER CAMPBELL OF NETWORK, ONE OF THE GROUP'S, SAYS THEY'RE JUST FOLLOWING THE GOSPEL.
WELL, THE VATICAN SAYS WE WORK TOO MUCH FOR THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN POVERTY. AND THAT WE'VE BEEN SILENT ON THE ISSUES OF ABORTION, GAY MARRIAGE, AND, THEREFORE, WE ARE SUSPECT.
Reporter: SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WHEN YOU'RE ADVOCATING  FOR POOR PEOPLE, YOU'RE NOT ALSO TELLING THEM GAY MARRIAGE AND ABORTION IS A SIN.
THAT'S NOT OUR MISSION.
HAVE YOU EVER HELPED A POOR, GAY, MARRIED COUPLE.
WE HELPED A GAY COUPLE, YES.
AND YOU COULDN'T TAKE A FEW MINUTES OUT OF YOUR DAY TO SHAME THEM?
ACTUALLY NO.
IT'S THIS KIND OF INSOLENCE THAT FORCED VATICAN TO SEND A  BISHOP TO STRAIGHT OWN OUT THE FELLIN-NUNSIES. SO YOU PLAN ON REFORMS YURG WAYS, CORRECT?
IN MY VIEW, WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO REFORM.
Reporter: I RECALL SOMETHING ABOUT THE POPE BEING INFALLIBLE AND AWESOME.
THE POPE IS AWESOME, BUT INFALLIBLE ON VERY FEW THIGZ.
Reporter: OH, NO YOU DID NOT. YOU JUST PICKED A FIGHT WITH THE POPE!
I JUST OBEYED JESUS.
THAT'S JUST NUN-SENSE. I HAVE, LIKE, 27 MORE OF THOSE. SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF THE ITALIAN BUSINESS MODEL, SO I SAT DOWN  WITH ENTREPRENEUR AND ITALIAN BUSINESS EXPORT, LEWIS FERRANTE.
THERE'S A CHAIN OF COMMAND. IT MUST BE FOLLOWED, PERIOD.
Reporter: YES, THANK YOU, FINALLY. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW DIRECT ORDERS FROM YOUR BOSS?
YOU GET WHACKED. TWO IN THE DOME, THREE IN THE COCONUT.
Reporter: I'M GOING TO WRITE THAT DOWN. THAT'S GREAT.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ENCASED IN A ( BLEEP ) BASEMENT.
Reporter: I'M SORRY, WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS EXPERIENCE EXACTLY?
I WAS IN THE MAFIA FOR MOST OF MY LIFE AND I DID EIGHT AND A HALF YEARS IN THE CAN, TOO.
Reporter: OKAY, PERFECT, HE UNDERSTANDS THE CODE THAT THE VATICAN LIST BY.
YO, KEEP YOUR ( BLEEP ) NOSE CLEAN AND MIND YOUR BUSINESS.
Reporter: THIS IS SO GOOD BECAUSE THIS NUN WE WERE TALKING TO IS A REAL PIECE OF WORK.
A NUN?
Reporter: YES.
LISTEN, YOU DON'T ( BLEEP ) WITH WITH A BUNCH OF NUNS. THESE BROADS ARE TRYING TO ( BLEEP ) HUMAN THE POOR. THEY DON'T GIVE A ( BLEEP ) ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE AND ABORTION.
CAN YOU GIVE UP ARGUING WITH THE VATICAN FOR LENT?
QUITE FRANKLY, NO. THE GOSPEL SAYS IT'S OUR JOB TO SPEAK UP.
WOW, YOU HAVE A GIANT SET OF NUN BALLS ON YOU, LADY.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. BUT I DO KNOW WE HAVE THE COURAGE OF OUR CONVICTIONS.
ARE YOU SO HARD CORE. I COULDN'T DENY IT ANY LONGER. NUNS KICK MAJOR ASS, AND I WANTED A PIECE. YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH ME? TALK TO MY NUN. YOU WANT TO GET ALL UP IN MY BUSINESS? CHECK IT OUT. I GOT A NUN. AND TOGETHER, WITH ME AND MY SISTER PATROLLING THE STREETS, THE VATICAN'S GOING TO THINK TWICE ABOUT PICKING ON THE WRONG PEOPLE EVER AGAIN.
ROMAN CATHOLIC BISHOPS ARE INVESTIGATING THE GIRL SCOUTS. BISHOPS ARE CONCERNED THAT SOME OF THE ORGANIZATION'S PROGRAMS  CONTRADICT THE CHURCH'S VIEWS ON CONTRACEPTION AND ABORTION.
Reporter: ARE
