Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME SHALL JON STEWART. OH, LISTEN TO THE CROWD. THEY ARE SO FIRED UP FOR INDEPENDENCE DAY. I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NOW, PAKISTAN INDEPENDENCE DAY  TOO OR JUST INDIA? THAT WAS YESTERDAY? IT'S ON A DIFFERENT DAY? YESTERDAY. I THINK I JUST STARTED A FIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT THE SMOOTH SOOTHE SAR OF THE MONEY HONEY BEAR ALI VELSHI WILL BE  JOINING US BUT OUR BIG STORY TONIGHT IS IS PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS. NEW CANDIDATES IN, OLD CANDIDATES OUT. IT ALL HAPPENED HERE. AMES, IOWA. FOUNDED IN 1632 BY WILLIE AMES. YES, ONCE AGAIN AMES IOWA IN THE SPOTLIGHT AS A RESULT OF THE 2011 IOWA STRAW POLL ARE IN.
WITH 16,892 IOWANS VOTING, THE WINNER OF THE 2011 IOWA STRAW POLL IS CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN.
Jon: THERE YOU GO.
AUDIENCE: BOO.
Jon: I SEE WE HAVE A LOT OF PAWLENTY SUPPORTERS IN THE AUDIENCE THIS EVENING. BACKMAN WINS. THE AYES OR SHALL I SAY THE CRAZY EYES HAVE IT. MICHELE BACHMANN'S 4,823 VOTES NARROWLY CLIPPING RON PAUL. NO ONE ELSE EVEN CLOSE. EXCITING VICTORY. LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO THROW COLD WATER ON IT IN 3, 2,... BOOM. FORMER GEORGE BUSH STRATEGIST MATTHEW DOW.
AMES HAS NEVER HAD A HISTORY OF PICKING WINNERS BUT THEY'VE CERTAINLY HAD A  HISTORY OF PICKING LOSERS.
Jon: MICHELE BACHMANN SO YOU WON. ONE OF THE ACTUAL LOSERS OF THE POLL, THEY MUST BE CELEBRATING THEIR NOT WINNING.
WE NEEDED TO GET SOME LIFT TO CONTINUE ON AND TO HAVE A PATHWAY FORWARD. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. SO I'M ANNOUNCING THIS MORNING ON YOUR SHOW THAT I'M GOING TO BE ENDING MY CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT.
Jon: (SNORING). HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH THAT GUY IN IOWA. ANY TIME HE'S AROUND YOU CANNOT OPERATE HEAVY FARM MACHINERY. SIR, STOP TALKING. I HAVE TO WORK MY CROPS. SO THE REPUBLICANS MOVE INTO THE FALL WITH MICHELE BACHMANN THE BIG STORY. WHAT WAS THAT? THAT LAUGH, SO FAMILIAR, SO REGIONAL. I CAN'T PLACE IT. IT CAN'T BE. HE'S NOT ELIGIBLE TO RUN AGAIN.
I DECLARE TO YOU TODAY AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SOMETIMES IT KIND OF TAKES ME A WHILE TO GET INTO SOMETHING LIKE THIS  PRESIDENTIAL RACE, BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHEN I'M IN, I'M IN ALL THE WAY.
Jon: WHY WOULD THE JOSH BROLIN CHARACTER FROM W BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? WHAT? THAT'S A REAL GUY? NO. I INTERVIEWED HIM? OH. THREE-TERM TEXAS GOVERNOR. I'M SURE I'M OVERREACTING. TWO TEXAS GOVERNORS WHO SORT OF SOUND ALIKE. HOW SIMILAR COULD THEY BE?
THEY'RE TWO GUYS FROM WEST TEXAS. SAME TEXAS BOOTS. SAME KIND OF IDEOLOGIES. SIMILAR MANNERS AND SOME OF THAT WEST TEXAS SWAGGER.
FORMER AIR FORCE PILOT AND FATHER OF TWO.
MET HIS WIFE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. HE HOLDS A DAY-PRAYER AND CARRIES A LASER-FIRED PISTOL. HE IS GEORGE BUSH ON STEROIDS.
Jon: NO. NO, HE'S NOT! HE'S NOT GEORGE BUSH ON STEROIDS. RICK PERRY IS WHAT HAPPENS IF LEX LUTHOR DISSTILLED GEORGE BUSH'S ESSENCE IN A LABORATORY  AND CROSSED IT WITH GUN POWDER AND SEMEN FROM THE FINEST THOROUGHBRED AND STRAPPEDED  THAT CONCOCTION ON TO A NUCLEAR MISSILE AND SHOT IT INTO THE (BEEP) SUN. AND THEN WAITED, WAITED, WAITED, UNTIL ONE DAY ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE ALAMO A SOLAR FLARE YADA YADA YAD RICK PERRY. HOW DO I KNOW THAT THIS CREATURE IS GEORGE BUSH-PLUS- PLUS? OH, I'LL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW.
HE'S A MAN OF TRUST IN HIS FAMILY. HIS FATHER-IN-LAW ACTUALLY DID HIS VASECTOMY. (LAUGHING)
Jon: MAY I REMIND YOU, HIS FATHER-IN-LAW IS NOT A DOCTOR. (LAUGHING) JUST ONE OF THESE. HOLD STILL, RICK. WHICH WANT DO YOU WANT VASECTOMYED FIRST? SO NOW WITH PAWLENTY DROPPING OUT, RICK PERRY DROPPING IN, WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A RACE.
WE HAVE A TOP TIER. IT IS MITT ROMNEY, RICK PERRY AND MICHELE BACHMANN.
WE HAVE A NEW TOP TIER. PERRY, ROMNEY AND BACHMANN.
THERE'S A TOP TIER IN THIS RACE OF ROMNEY, PERRY AND BACHMANN.
THAT'S FAIR SO SAY.
Jon: REALLY, FAIR TO SAY? YOU'RE NOT FORGETTING ANYONE SAY AN IDEOLOGICALLY CONSISTENT CONGRESSMAN WHO  CAME WITHIN 200 VOTES OF WINNING THE STRAW POLL. ISN'T ANYONE GOING TO GIVE THAT GENTLEMAN A LITTLE LOVE.
THERE'S A TOP TIER OF BACHMANN, PERRY AND ROMNEY AND WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED, WE SHOULD.
Bob: THANK YOU.
WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED WE SHOULD RICK SANTORUM WHO DID SURPRISINGLY WELL FOR THE  AMOUNT OF MONEY AND RESOURCES HE HAD.
Jon: RICK SANTORUM. HE DIDN'T GET HALF OF WHAT RON PAUL GOT. HE LOST TO THE GUY WHO LOST SO BAD HE DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE. SANTORUM?
WE'RE LOOKING AT MITT ROMNEY WHO CONTINUES TO BE THE FRONTRUNNER. BUT WE HAVE RICK PERRY AS WELL AND NOW MICHELE BACHMANN. LET'S NOT COUNT OUT JOHN HUNTSMAN THOUGH.
Jon: WHAT? JOHN HUNTSMAN? HUNTSMAN GOT 69 VOTES. IF ALL OF JOHN HUNTSMANS SPORTERS MET AT THE SAME AMES IOWA RESTAURANT THE FIRE  MARSHAL WOULD SAY, THAT'S FINE. NO PROBLEM. THERE'S STILL SOME TABLES OPEN IN THE BACK. HUNTSMAN WAS THE ONLY MORMON RUNNING IN THE STRAW POLL, AND HE CAME IN SECOND AMONGST MORMONS. AND BY THE WAY THIS PRETENDING RON PAUL DOESN'T EXIST FOR SOME REASON HAS BEEN GOING ON  FOR WEEKS.
A NEW GALLUP SURVEY SHOWING RICK PERRY RUNNING SECOND TO MITT ROMNEY KNOCKING DOWN IOWA  FAVORITE MICHELE BACHMANN TO FOURTH.
Jon: BEHIND WHO? FOURTH BEHIND WHO? HOW DID LIBERTARIAN RON PAUL BECOME THE 13th FLOOR IN A HOE HOTEL? WHY... WHAT'S WRONG WITH... HE IS TEA PARTY PATIENT ZERO. ALL THAT SMALL GOVERNMENT GRASS ROOTS BUSINESSES HE PLANTED THAT GRASS. THESE OTHER FOLKS ARE JUST MORAL MAJORITIES IN A TRY CORNERED HAT. RON PAUL IS THE REAL DEAL. FOX NEWS SHOULD LOVE THIS GUY. WATCH THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE DEBATE MODERATORS AT FOX'S THURSDAY'S DEBATE AND THE  DEBATE AUDIENCE.
IRAN DOES NOT HAVE AN AIR FORCE THAT CAN COME HERE. JUST LIKE WE DID IN IRAQ, BUILD UP THE WAR PROPAGANDA. THERE IS NO AL QAEDA IN IRAQ. THEY HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND WE HAD TO GO IN. I'M SURE YOU SUPPORTED THAT WAR AS WELL. IT'S TIME WE QUIT THIS. IT'S TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE'RE SPENDING ON THESE WARS.
Jon: WHAT'S WITH THE SMIRK AND THE EYE ROLL? THE CROWD GOES NUTS AND YOU DO ONE OF THESE. THERE GOES CRAZY UNCLE RON. BABBLING ABOUT THE UNSUSTAINABILITY OF MULTIPLE WARS. HE'S THE ONE GUY IN THE FIELD WHO DOESN'T GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO REGURGITATE TALKING POINTS  OR CHANGE WHAT HE BELIEVES TO FIT THE AUDIENCE HE'S IN FRONT OF YOU. AND YOU'RE TREATING HIM LIKE IF THIS WERE CELEBRITY APPRENTICE, HE'D BE THIS GUY. BY THE WAY, OF THE AMES IOWA STRAW POLL IT USE TO BE HUNTSMAN 77-69. EVEN WHEN THE MEDIA DOES REMEMBER RON PAUL IT'S ONLY TO REASSURE THEMSELVES THERE'S NO  NEED TO REMEMBER THERE WAS RON PAUL.
SEVERAL OF THE CANDIDATES ARE HERE TODAY. WE HAVE LIVE PICTURES OF RON PAUL BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SARAH PALIN AND RICK PERRY, TWO PEOPLE NOT IN THE RACE YET TOO.
IF YOU GET VIDEO OF IS AOR A PALIN OR GET A SOUND BITE FROM HER, BRING THAT BACK TO US. YOU CAN HOLD THE RON PAUL STUFF.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
