NOVEMBER 15, 2011.
FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW", MY NAME IS JON STEWART. ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT, MY GUEST... WE ARE EXCITED TONIGHT. MY GUEST, ASTRONAUT-- YOU HEARD ME CORRECTLY-- ASTRONAUT AND AUTHOR MARK KELLY. DID YOU KNOW, WHEN MARK KELRY WAS A LITTLE BOY HE DREAMED OF GROWING UP TO BE A REGIONAL  COPPER WIRING DISTRIBUTOR. (LAUGHTER) BUT HE WAS A FAILURE! (LAUGHTER) AND ENDED UP HAVING TO AS ROE NAUGHT. (LAUGHTER) I THINK THAT'S A VERB FOR BEING A ASTRONAUT. I'M NOT SURE. ANYWAY, JUST TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AGO WE FOUND OUT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE HERMAN CAIN HAD SEXUAL HARASSMENT ISSUES WHEN THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION  SETTLED SOME LAWSUITS FOR HIM SETTING OFF A MEDIA FIRESTORM WHICH LASTED UNTIL SIX DAYS AGO  WHEN REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RICK PERRY FIRED THE BRAIN FART HEARD ROUND THE WORLD. (LAUGHTER) ALSO SETTING OFF A MEDIA FIRESTORM. BUT, AGAIN, THAT'S SIX DAYS AGO! DADDY NEED ANOTHER HIT OF GAS BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THE RACE TO DETERMINE THE MOST QUALIFIED  OPPONENT TO CHALLENGE THE CURRENT LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD IN THE NOVEMBER 2012 GENERAL  ELECTION IS BORING ME! ANYONE?
IS THIS A RICK PERRY "OOPS" MOMENT FOR HERMAN CAIN? (LAUGHTER) GO ON. (LAUGHTER)
HERMAN CAIN CAUGHT ON CAMERA WITH AN INCREDIBLY AWKWARD AND RAMBLING EXPLANATION FOR HIS  POSITION ON LIBYA.
I CALL IT HIS DAZED AND CONFUSED MOMENT.
THE CAIN TRAIN. I TELL YOU WHAT, IT GOES OFF THE TRACKS.
ANOTHER VERY AWKWARD MOMENT.
FINAL STRAW, MAYBE, FOR A SINKING CAMPAIGN?
SERIOUS BRAIN FREEZE.
THAT WHOLE TAPE WAS SORT OF LIKE A CAR CRASH. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YOU'RE EXAGGERATING! THERE'S NO WAY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW PEOPLE WILL LIVE UP IN MY  TRY THE HYPERBOLIC GLEE THAT WE ARE ALL DISPLAYING. ROLL THE TAPE.
SO YOU AGREE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA ON LIBYA OR NOT?
OKAY, LIBYA. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) WOW! WOW! HOLY (BLEEP). IT'S LIKE HE'S TRYING TO DOWN LEAD TO ANSWER BUT... (LAUGHTER). IT'S STWHRAWS LITTLE BALL IS SPINNING, HE'S JUST BUFFERING!
PRESIDENT OBAMA SUPPORTED THE UPRISING, CORRECT? PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLED FOR THE REMOVAL OF QADDAFI. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING BEFORE I SAY YES I AGREE OR NO I  DIDN'T AGREE.
Jon: I JUST WANT TO SAY SOMETHING HERE. THIS IS NOT A SPELLING BE WHERE YOU CAN JUST ASK THE MODERATOR FOR THE LANGUAGE OF ORIGIN TO  BUY YOURSELF SOME TIME. "COULD YOU USE THAT IN A SENTENCE?" (LAUGHTER) LIKE "MOST CONSERVATIVE  REPUBLICAN VOTERS FEEL PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HANDLING OF LIBYA WAS--" (LAUGHTER) BLANK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M SURE HE WAS GETTING AROUND TO ANSWERING THE QUESTION AT HAND.
I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE WAY HE HANDLED IT FOR THE FOLLOWING  REASONS: UM... NO, THAT'S A DIFFERENT ONE. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: (WHISPERING) I AM FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S A DIFFERENT ONE? (LAUGHTER) WHAT REASON... WHAT IS CAIN GOING THROUGH IN HIS MENTAL ROLODEX. NO, THAT'S MY POLICY REGARDING A WOMAN NAMED LYDIA. ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS... NO, THAT'S MY POSITION ON THE LOCATION OF THE LABIA. THAT'S NOT IT. (LAUGHTER) OH, THAT'S THE FUNNY COMEDIAN FROM THE MOVIE "HEY LADY!" COME ON, CAIN. YOU'RE FORGETTING THE CARDINAL RULE: IF YOU STUDY HIGH YOU HAVE TO BE HIGH WHEN YOU TAKE THE TEST! (LAUGHTER) PULL IT TOGETHER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'VE GOT TO GO BACK. I'VE GOT ALL THIS STUFF TWIRLING AROUND IN MY HEAD. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: NO, I FEEL FOR YOU, YOU KNOW? I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TWIRLING AROUND IN MY HEAD AS WELL. DIFFICULT BUT YOU KNOW BEING PRESIDENT'S A REAL NONSTOP HEAD STUFF TWIRL FEST. (LAUGHTER) IF I MAY QUOTE ABRAHAM LINCOLN. (LAUGHTER) EVENTUALLY, THOUGH, ONCE THE STUFF STOPS TWIRLING, HERMAN  CAIN DID COME UP WITH AN ANSWER.
I WOULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB OF DETERMINING WHO THE OPPOSITION IS. AND I'M SURE THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE HAD THAT... HAD SOME OF THAT INFORMATION. BASED UPON WHO MADE UP THAT OPPOSITION, OKAY, BASED UPON WHO MADE UP THAT OPPOSITION, MIGHT  HAVE CAUSED ME TO MAKE SOME DIFFERENT DECISIONS ANT HOW WE PARTICIPATED.
Jon: I SEE. SO YOU'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT. (LAUGHTER) WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST IGNORE THE QUESTION, SHAKE YOUR HEAD AND GO "999? ".
Reporter: MR. CAIN, DO YOU THINK THE LIBYA COMMENTS REENFORCE...
LET US GO THROUGH.
Reporter: DHASH YOU DON'T HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF FOREIGN POLICY?
999. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MORE FOR MORE ON THE FALLOUT, WE TURN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT JASON  JONES WHO'S AT CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS. AS YOU HEARD IN THE QUESTION PREVIOUSLY, DOES HERMAN CAIN'S ANSWER ON LIBYA CONTINUE TO JUST  REINFORCE THE IDEA HE'S NOT YET READY TO COMPETE ON A POLICY LEVEL WITH THE OTHER G.O.P. CANDIDATES?
JON, BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT LIB YARKS CAIN'S ADVISORS ARE ADAMANTLY INSISTING THAT THIS  SEXUAL HARASSMENT SCANDAL IS NOT OVER AND THAT WHO KNOWS HOW MANY MORE WOMEN COULD STILL BE OUT THERE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: CAIN'S ADVISORS?
THAT IS CORRECT. ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES HERE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT SOME OBSCURE FOREIGN WAR! THEY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MATTER: LIKE HERMAN CAIN'S POSSIBLY UNSTOPPABLE URGE  TO PUT HIS HAND-- OR HANDS, OR FEET-- UP LADIES' SKIRTS.
Jon: HERMAN CAIN'S ADVISORS WANT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT FROM  LIBYA TO HERMAN CAIN'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT SCANDAL?
YES. THEAFL THE LONGER THE LAMESTREAM MEDIA FOCUSES ON FOREIGN POLICY-- OR REALLY POLICY IN  GENERAL-- THE MORE IT HURTS THEIR GUY.
Jon: RIGHT, BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT CHARGES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND CONFUSION OTHER  HIS CAMPAIGN'S HANDLING OF IT HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HELP TO FEEL CAIN, EITHER.
RIGHT. RIGHT. BUT I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING REAL QUICK.
LIBYA. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: PEOPLE CAN TAKE A SEXUAL CREEP IN THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT NOBODY'S GOING FOR THAT! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE... WHAT'S THE CAMPAIGN DO NOW?
WELL, THEY'RE GOING REJIGGER THEIR STRATEGY. IT'S ALREADY STARTING WITH NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGANS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S A GOOD ONE. THEY'RE ALSO CONSIDERING THIS. (LAUGHTER) OR, JON, MAYBE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE CLASSIC. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: NONE OF THOSE SEEM PARTICULARLY HELPFUL. SNEUM OR HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO TALKING ABOUT LIBYA.
Jon: POINT TAKEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
