A PARTY, TOO HISTORY ON NICK FOR FACTS. A CANDIDATE TOO SUCCESSFUL FOR TAXES. A CITY WHERE FLIP-FLOPS ARE EVERYWHERE. FROM TAMPA, FLORIDA. THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION, THE ROAD TO JEB BUSH 2016!  Captioning sponsored by  COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. IN THE GREAT CITY OF TAMPA, THIS IS THE THIRD NIGHT THAT OFFICIALLY QUALIFIES THE DAILY  SHOW AS AN INVASIVE SPECIES. SO MICHAEL STEELE WILL BE JOINING US AT THE END TOO MUCH SHOW, MOMENTS AGO MITT ROMNEY OF  MASSACHUSETTS ACCEPTED HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION FOR THE PRESIDENCY, IT WAS A SPEECH FULL  OF SENTENCES. THAT I THOUGHT HE REALLY DELIVERED IN ENGLISH. WE WILL HAVE MORE DETAILS TOMORROW. BUT YESTERDAY, IT WAS ROMNEY'S RUNNING MATE PAUL RYAN'S PARTY  FAVORITE, AND ELECTRIC SPEAKER AND TO HIGHLIGHT THE THEME, WE CAN CHANGE IT. EITHER A REFERENCE TO THE TERRIBLE STATE OF THIS COUNTRY OR SOMETHING CONVENTION  ORGANIZERS JUST PUT IN AS A PLACEHOLDER AND, YOU KNOW.  EITHER WAY, THE MAIN EVENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE JACK OF JANESVILLE, THE WISCONSIN WONDER BOY, MR. PAUL -- HOLY  (BLEEP) THAT GUY IS AND SOME!  LOOK AT THOSE EYES!  PAUL RYAN, ARUBA CALL AND WANTS THE POOLS OF BLUE TRANQUIL WATER BACK. WHOO!
YOUNG AND FIT, HAS A POLITICAL PARTY EVER HAD A GREATER DISPARITY BETWEEN THE  VITALITY OF ONE OF ITS VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES AND THE MEMBER OF THEIR PARTY'S LAST, WHO LAST HELD THE POSITION?  I MEAN, THAT IS -- WOW. I MEAN, THAT IS -- NO!  HE STOLE HIS VITALITY!  HE TURNED HIMSELF INTO ROCK HUDSON?  HOW DID THE  EFFECTS GUY DO THAT?  HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS. RYAN DOESN'T NEED TO RELY ON HIS LOOKS. THE MAN HAS GOT GAME.
WITH PAUL RYAN, HONESTY.
SPOKESMAN OF HARD TRUTHS.
HERE IS A MAN NOT AFRAID TO TELL THE TRUTH.
RYAN AND ROMNEY ARE GOING TO RUN ON FACTS.
PAUL RYAN IS SO HONEST EVERY TIME HE TALKS, HIS NOSE SHRINKS. PAUL RYAN IS SO HONEST HIS POKER TELL IS, I AM STAYING IN, BUT I HAVE TERRIBLE CARDS. PAUL RYAN IS SO HONEST YOU KNOW WHAT HE CALLS HONEST ABE LINCOLN?  A (BLEEP) LIAR. THAT'S WHAT HE CALLS HIM. OKAY. COME ON, PAUL RYAN, I AM BRACE FORD THE HARD TRUTH, HIT ME.
AFTER FOUR YEARS OF GETTING THE RUN AROUND AMERICA NEEDS A TURNAROUND.
OKAY, I WOULD HAVE GONE WITH REACH AROUND, BUT --
THAT'S WHY I AM WHERE I AM AND WHY YOU ARE WHERE YOU ARE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET TO THE IDEAS.
WE WILL KEEP FEDERAL SPENDING AT 20 PERCENT OF GDP OR LESS. 12 MILLION NEW JOBS OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.
STRENGTHEN MEDICARE FOR MY MOM'S GENERATION AND WE WILL PUT  GOVERNMENT BACK ON THE SIDE OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO CREATE JOBS.
THAT IS AMBITIOUS. THAT IS GOING TO BE HARD. I AM READY FOR THE TOUGH TRUTH OF HOW IT IS GOING TO GET US THERE. ALL RIGHT. HIT ME WITH THE DEETS.
WE WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. WE WILL REAPPLY OUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES. WE WILL NOT DUCK THE TOUGH ISSUES. WE WILL LEAD.
Jon: OH. A ROMNEY-RYAN ADMINISTRATION WILL DO GOOD, NOT BAD. BECAUSE BAD IS THE LESSER OF THOSE OPTIONS. THAT IS A SPEECH, YOU ARE A POLICY EXPERT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ARETHA FRANKLIN WILL COME OUT AND KNIT FOR YOU. OH, COME ON. ALL RIGHT. NO DETAILS, BUT PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND ON THIS WEEK'S THEME, THAT ANY  SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IS SOLELY THE RESULT OF INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT.
AND I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS TOO. IF YOU ARE FEELING LEFT OUT OR PASSED BY, YOU HAVE NOT FAILED. YOUR LEADERS HAVE FAILED YOU.
Jon: TIME OUT, CHISELED CHIN MCNICE FACE-INGTON.
REALLY GOOD-LOOKING.
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. SO IF YOUR DRY CLEANING BUSINESS SECTION WITH A DEMOCRAT IN OFFICE, YOU BUILT THAT, BUT IF  YOUR DRY CLEANING BUSINESS FAILS WITH A DEMOCRAT IN OFFICE, THE GOVERNMENT (BLEEP) YOU. SO SHOW ME MORE HARD TRUTHS. THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT JUST IS A CONVENIENT TRUTH. YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT IN HIS SPEECH I WOULD SETTLE FOR ANY TRUTH.
$760 BILLION FUNNELED OUT OF MEDICARE BY PRESIDENT OBAMA.
WHAT?  YOU MEAN THE $716 BILLION IN PAYMENTS TO PROVIDER EXACT SAME AMOUNT  REPUBLICANS ALSO PROPOSED FOR CUTS TO MEDICARE IN THEIR HIGHLY PRAISED WHAT WAS THE NAME OF IT?   RYAN BUDGET?  I CAN'T BELIEVE RYAN SEACREST WOULD SUGGEST -- WAIT A MINUTE!  RYAN!
HE CREATED A NEW BIPARTISAN DEBT COMMISSION. THEY CAME BACK WITH AN URGENT REPORT. HE THANKED THEM, SENT THEM ON THEIR WAY AND THEN DID EXACTLY NOTHING.
Jon: OH, RIGHT. THAT WAS THE BOWLES-SIMPSON PROPOSAL THAT WAS NEVER OFFICIALLY PRESENTED TO CONCERT  IN PART BECAUSE IT WAS VOTED DOWN BY A BLUE-EYED DREAM BOAT NAMED RYAN. RYAN GOSLING -- WAIT A MINUTE!  YOU KNOW WHAT?  WE NEED TO TELL A PERSONAL STORY ABOUT AN AUTO  PLANT THAT CLOSED IN RYAN'S DISTRICT. PERHAPS THIS WILL HOLD HARD TRUTHS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA, CANDIDATE OBAMA SAID I BELIEVE IF OUR GOVERNMENT IS THERE TO SUPPORT  YOU THIS PLANT WILL BE HERE FOR ANOTHER 100 YEARS. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID IN 2008. THAT PLANT DIDN'T LAST ANOTHER YEAR. THE RECOVERY THAT WAS PROMISED IS NOWHERE IN SIGHT.
Jon: YEAH, EXCEPT THAT PLANT ANNOUNCED IN JUNE OF 2008 THAT IT WOULD BE STOPPING  PRODUCTION, HOLD ON A SECOND, SIRI, WHO WAS PRESIDENT IN JUNE OF 2008?  GEORGE BUSH!  THANK YOU, SIR I ARE, THANK YOU, SIRI, THIS WAS THE INTELLECTUAL LEADER OF THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY'S BIG NIGHT. HOW WILL HE SPIN HIS WAY OUT OF IT.
I DIDN'T SAY PRESIDENT OBAMA SHUT DOWN THAT PLANT, WHAT IT WAS WAS AN INDICTMENT ON A  DEEPER LEVEL WHICH IS A DEBATE I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE.
I THINK HE DIDN'T PROVIDE CONTEXT.
WELL, YOU KNOW, BROADER POINT I THINK IS HOW IS THE MY DOING  UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND DID HE KEEP HIS PROMISES?
IN BROADER TERMS WHAT IT IS THEY BELIEVE, THAT IS THE DEBATE  I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS GOING TO WATCH VERY CLOSELY.
WELL, LOOK, WHEN PEOPLE GIVE SPEECHES, NOT EVERY PACKET IS ALWAYS ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE.
Jon: OH, YEAH?  WELL, THEY JUST TAKE A COUPLE OF FACTS AND  JUST COMB THEM OVER A GIANT AREA OF (BLEEP)?  HERE IS A PROBLEM, MR. JULIEN, IF YOU HAVE A FACT THAT IS NOT ACCURATE, IT IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED A FACT. AT THAT POINT IT IS CONSIDERED, WHAT DO THEY CALL IT, AN UNFACT. I AM SURE WILL IS A QUICKER WAY OF SAYING THAT. WE ARE JOINED BY JON, OUR CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER:
YOU OBVIOUSLY, YOU WERE ON THE FLOOR AND SAW THE SPEECH LAST NIGHT.
I DID, JON, AND IT REALLY HIT HOME FOR ME.
I GUESS BECAUSE MY PARENTS ONCE OWNED A SMALL BUSINESS, A CANDLE EMPORIUM IN AKRON, OHIO. IN 2009, PRESIDENT OBAMA VISITED AND PROMISED IT WOULD BECOME THE BIGGEST CANDLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD. TWO WEEKS LATER IT BURNED TO THE GROUND IN A TERRIBLE BEAUTIFULLY TAINTED FIRE. OBVIOUSLY I STILL TEAR UP WHENEVER I SMELL LAVENDER.
Jon: RIGHT. IT IS A POWERFUL STORY. OBVIOUSLY NONE OF THAT IS TRUE. YOUR PARENTS ARE DEFENSE IN ENGLAND.
THAT IS NOT THE POINT, JON. WHAT WAS THE THEME OF LAST NIGHT'S CONVENTION?
Jon: WE CAN CHANGE IT.
EXACTLY. AND THAT IS WHAT I HAVE JUST DONE. LAST NIGHT'S THEME I CHOSE TO CHANGE FACTS, REALITY AND THE MEANING OF WORDS IN ORDER TO  MAKE A MUCH LARGER POINT.
Jon: BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT. WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS -- YOU DON'T IGNORE THE TRUTH WHEN IT DOESN'T SUPPORT YOUR PURPLE.
YOU CAN WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO SAVE YOUR COUNTRY FROM A SOCIALIST TYRANT.
Jon: WHO IS THAT?
BARACK OBAMA.
Jon: BUT HE IS NOT. HE IS --
I KNOW, JON, AND THAT'S WHY THE REPUBLICANS CHANGED THAT.
Jon:.
DO YOU AGREE THEY WANT TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE?
Jon: OF COURSE THEY DO.
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER, JON, TO DEFEAT A SOCIALIST TYRANT, HELL-BENT ON DESTROYING THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE RATHER THAN A FUZZY CENTER LEFT LIKEABLE TECHNOCRAT?
Jon: SURE, I MEAN THAT IS OBVIOUSLY --
EXACTLY.
Jon: BUT THAT WOULD BE A LIE.
MILLIONS THEY CHANGED IT, JON.
UNLESS THEY CHANGED IT, JON.
THAT IS WHAT LAST NIGHT WAS ABOUT AND FOR GOOD REASON. REFRAMING THE BROADER DEBATE AS TYRANNICAL DEMOCRATS VERSUS FREEDOM LOVING REPUBLICANS IS  ONE REPUBLICANS CAN WIN.
Jon: BUT IT IS NOT THE REAL DEBATE.
YES, IT IS, THEY HAVE CHANGED IT!.
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING AS LONG AS IT HELPS THEM GET WHAT THEY WANT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO  WHATEVER THEY WANT.
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY, JON. LAST NIGHT I MET A VERY ATTRACTIVE AND VERY DRUNK GIRL. AND LIKE PAUL RYAN, I DELIVERED A SPEECH TO HER ABOUT MY LIFE. NOW, AM I A PURPLE HEART RECIPIENT ON, OR AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST?
Jon: NO. YOU ARE NOT.
TRUE. BUT DID SHE WAKE UP NEXT TO ME THIS MORNING BEFORE GOING AND TELLING HER FRIENDS THAT SHE  JUST HAD SEX WITH A WAR HERO OLYMPIAN?
YES, JON, YES, SHE DID. AND WHO IS TO SAY THAT HER TRUTH, JON, IS ANY LESS TRUE THAN MINE.
Jon: YOU LIED TO HER TO GET HER INTO BED.
JON, WHEN SHE SAW ME SHE WAS NOT ATTRACTED TO ME. I INSTANTLY THOUGHT, WE CAN CHANGE THAT. SO I TOLD HER A SERIES OF FACTS THAT WERE NOT ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE IN ORDER TO REALIZE THE  MUCH LARGER TRUTH THAT I WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH HER.
Jon: THAT IS HORRIBLE.
WHAT CHOICE DID I HAVE, JON, IF I DIDN'T SAY THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD SEX WITH HER!
Jon: YOU ARE A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE PERSON.
DEBT USN'T MATTER, JON. I CAN CHANGE THAT!
Jon: ALL RIGHT. JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK
