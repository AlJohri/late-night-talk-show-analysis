AUGUST 18th, 2011,FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: NO, NO! I APPLAUD YOU. (LAUGHTER) OUR GUEST THE MULTITALENTED ANNE HATHAWAY, VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT. BUT FIRST, THERE IS AN ONGOING ARGUMENT IN THIS VERY COUNTRY, ABOUT HOW BEST TO CLOSE THE ENORMOUS  DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE INCURRED. REPUBLICANS HAVE PROPOSED DOING IT ENTIRELY THROUGH SPENDING CUTS. WHEREAS THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BRAVELY FOUGHT BACK INSISTING WE DO IT ALMOST ENTIRELY THROUGH SPENDING CUTS. WELL, THIS WEEK BIZARRELY UNECCENTRIC BILLIONAIRE WARREN BUFF AT THE TIME ENTERED THE FREY.
THE BILLIONAIRE SAYS WHILE MOST AMERICANS STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET, WE MEGARICH CONTINUE TO GET OUR EXTRAORDINARY TAX BREAKS. MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE BEEN CODDLED LONG ENOUGH.
I PAY LOWER TAX RATE ON MUCH OF MY INCOME THAN MY CLEANING LADY DOES.
Jon: WELL, TO BE FAIR, WARREN BUFFETT'S CLEANING LADY IS ALSO A BILLIONAIRE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WARREN BUFFETT'S OP ED WAS A THOUGHTFUL TREATISE ON THE ADVANTAGES THE  SUPERWEALTHY CURRENTLY ENJOY AT THE HANDS AT THE TAX CODE. OR TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY.
UP NEXT TONIGHT, WARREN BUFFETT, CLASS WARFARE.
MORE CLASS WARFARE FROM AN A FABL BILLIONAIRE WHO SHOULD STOP ASSUMING THE  RICH ARE ALL BILLIONAIRES.
WARREN BUFFETT WROTE AN OP ED, IS HE COMPLETELY A SOCIALIST? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IS WARREN BUFFETT A SOCIALIST? YOU HAVE NO [BLEEP] CLUE WHAT SOCIALIST IS, DO YOU. HEY, THAT GEORGE CLOONEY ALWAYS BANGING DIFFERENT BROADS WHAT A YEAR. (LAUGHTER) -- WHAT A QUEER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO CLOSING A FEW CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLES AND RETURNING THE TOP MARGINAL  TAX RATE TO THE 90s ECONOMIC BOOM TIME LEVELS IS CLASS WARFARE. AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THE RICH HAVE LEARNED, IT'S THAT CLASS WARFARE IS HELL.
HE INVOKED THE CORPORATE JET CLASS.
SO THAT'S A WHOLE NEW CATEGORY OF PEOPLE TO DEMONIZE, RIGHT.
SOAK THE RICH, IT'S THEIR FAULT.
BARACK OBAMA'S TAX ON THESE EVIL, DISGUSTING CORPORATE JET OWNERS.
DEMONIZING THE RICH AS EVIL, AS LAZY, AS INHERITERS OF THEIR WEALTH.
HE'S SAYING FAT CATS.
IT'S DISAPPOINTING. IT'S CLASS WARFARE AND THE KIND OF LANGUAGE YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A LEADER OF A  THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY, NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Jon: TRUE, BECAUSE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS NOT A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY. BY ANY MEASURE. EXCEPT PERHAPS INCOME IN EQUALITY WHERE WE RANK-- WORSE THAN THE IVORY COAST, WORSE  THAN CAMEROON-- 64th. AH. IN YOUR FACE URUGUAY, JAMAICA AND UGANDA. (APPLAUSE) UGANDA? YEAH, UGANDA, YEAH. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: KEEP TRYING, RWANDA. (LAUGHTER) WOW. AND BY THE WAY, NOT ONLY IS CLOSING CORPORATE LOOPHOLES--  (LAUGHTER) YOU ARE A NERD CROWD. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, NOT ONLY IS CLOSING CORPORATE LOOPHOLES  AND RAISING THE MARGINAL TAX RATE CLASS WARFARE, IT TOTALLY WOULDN'T EVEN WORK.
YOU CAN TAX RICH PEOPLE ALL YOU WANT. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO --
THE IDEA THAT IF WE RAISE TAXES AS THE PRESIDENT SAID ON MILLIONAIRES AND  BILLIONAIRES, RAISE TAXES ON OIL COMPANIES, RAISE TAXES ON OWNERS OF PRIVATE JETS, THAT THAT SOMEHOW IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO RAISE THE TOP 2 INCOME TAX RATES WHICH WOULD RAISE  ABOUT $700 BILLION OVER TEN YEARS. YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S ONLY A TINY FRACTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DEFICIT.
Jon: $700 BILLION OVER TEN YEARS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S LESS MONEY THAN WARREN BUFFETT'S CLEANING LADY PULLS OUT OF HIS SHOWER  DRAIN EVERY WEEK. (LAUGHTER) NO,-- SO-- SO $700 BILLION OF RAISED REVENUE OVER TEN YEARS AIN'T EVEN WORTH THE EFFORT. I ASSUME THESE FOLKS HAVE THE SAME WHY BOTHER ATTITUDE TOWARDS LOW LEVEL SPENDING CUTS.
A NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS, FOR THE HUMANNITIES, ALL THOSE FRIVOLOUS THINGS THOSE  SHOULD ALL BE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES DON'T PAY FOR PARKING.
SO THAT WOULD GET THEM $140 MILLION.
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WASTE YOUR TAX DOLLARS AND TRAVEL AROUND IN A 1.1 MILLION  LUXURY LINER.
WHY ARE WE SPENDING $6 MILLION, $1 MILLION ON THE FIRST LADY.
YOU GOT TO START SOMEWHERE. EVEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT NPR, A MILLION DOLLARS HERE, THAT'S A MILLION DOLLARS.
Jon: OH, SO WHEN YOU CUT T IT'S A MILLION DOLLARS. BUT WHEN YOU TAX IT, IT'S OH, $700 BILLION. ALL WE HAD TO DO TO RAISE $700 BILLION IS CUT $700,000 NPRs. IT'S ALMOST TOO EASY. BUT IF IT'S REVENUE YOU WANT, IT DOES HAPPEN TO BE ANOTHER PLACE INSTEAD OF THE RICH THAT YOU CAN LOOK FOR IT.
WARREN BUFFETT WRITING HOW THE RICH SHOULD PAY MORE TAX BUT SAYING NOT A WORD  ABOUT THE HALF OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS THAT PAY NO INCOME TAXES AT ALL.
IS THAT FAIR WHEN HALF THE POPULATION PAYS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
51%, THAT'S A MAJORITY OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS PAID NO INCOME TAX IN 2009. ZERO. ZIP, IN ADDITIONA.
MANY OF THEM GET SO MUCH MONEY IN TAX CREDITS THAT IT WIPES OUT ANY SOCIAL  SECURITY TAXES OR MEDICARE TAXES THEY'RE PAYING. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY ON A FREE RIDE.
Jon: YOU HEAR THAT, POORS! THE FREE RIDE ESTA OVER. SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL BE WALKING TO WORK. ASSUMING YOU HAVE A JOB. CHANCES ARE YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE A JOB. SO WHY ARE YOU ASKING US FOR A RIDE. SO-- THE SOLUTION--  (APPLAUSE)
Jon: TO OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEM IS, THE SOLUTION TO OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEM ISN'T  TAXING THE RICH, IT'S --.
BROADEN THE TAX BASE.
EVERYONE NEEDS TO PAY SOMETHING.
BEFORE YOU START DEMANDING ONE GROUP PAY MORE, MAYBE GET EVERYONE TO PUT SKIN IN THE GAME.
Stephen: S THAT-- .
Jon: THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH POOR PEOPLE. THEY STILL HAVE SOME OF THEIR SKIN. (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE THEY'RE RIGHT. MAYBE FOX IS RIGHT. MAYBE THE BOTTOM 50% OF AMERICANS WHILE THEY ALREADY PAY EXCISE AND PAYROLL AND  MEDICARE TAXES DO NEED TO PAY MORE. I MEAN THEY CAN SPARE IT, AFTER ALL, THEY CONTROL 2.5 PERCENT OF OUR NATION'S WEALTH. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY THIS IS A PRETTY EASY CALCULATION. THE BOTTOM 50% IT IS SIMPLE MATH. IN DOLLAR FIGURES THE BOTTOM 50% OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE 1.45 TRILLION DOLLARS IN  EVERY THING THEY OWN ON THIS EARTH. SO LET'S SEE, THEY HAVE 1.45 TRILLION DOLLARS. SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TAKE I DON'T KNOW, HALF OF THAT. THAT WOULD BE, LOOK AT THIS, $700 BILLION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHY DOES THAT FIGURE SOUND SO FAMILIAR.
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO RAISE THE TOP 2 INCOME TAX RATES WHICH WOULD RAISE  ABOUT $700 BILLION OVER TEN YEARS. YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S ONLY A TINY FRACTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DEFICIT.
Jon: SO RAISING THE INCOME TAX RATE ON THE TOP 2% OF EARNERS WITH WOULD  RAISE 700 BILLION BUT TAKING HALF OF EVERYTHING THE BOTTOM 50% HAVE IN THIS  COUNTRY WOULD DO THE SAME. I SEE THE PROBLEM HERE. WE NEED TO TAKE ALL OF WHAT THE BOTTOM 50% HAVE. ALL OF IT. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DENT. NOW WE'RE UP TO 1.4 TRILLION. AND IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE POORS, DON'T. BECAUSE THEY'RE DEFINED BY THE CENSUS AS A FAMILY OF FOUR MAKING LESS THAN $22,350 A YEAR. FOUR, 22,350 A YEAR. THEY'LL BE FINE.
POOR FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL LIVING CONDITIONS OF THE 43 MILLION PEOPLE THAT  THE CENSUS SAYS ARE POOR YOU SEE THAT IN FACT THEY HAVE ALL THESE MODERN CONVENIENCES.
99% OF THEM HAVE A REFRIGERATOR. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: 99% HAVE REFRIGERATORS. YOU FOOD SHILLING MOTHER  [BLEEP] HOW DARE YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S WHY IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE! THAT'S WHY IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE THAT THE WORD "POOR" IN THAT GRAPHIC IS IN QUOTATIONS. THESE PEOPLE AREN'T POOR. THEY'RE-- I'M SURE THE OTHER 1% OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T  HAVE REFRIGERATORS DON'T HAVE THEM NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE FOOD BECAUSE  THEY'RE ALWAYS ORDERING ROOM SERVICE. THESE POOR PEOPLE ARE LIVING LIKE THEY JUST WON A SHOWCASE SHOWDOWN.
81% HAVE A MICROWAVE. 78% HAVE AIR CONDITIONING. 63% HAVE CABLE TV. 54% HAVE CELL PHONES. 48% HAVE A COFFEE MAKER. 25% HAVE A DISHWASHER.
Jon: 25% HAVE A DISHWASHER! THOUGH TO BE FAIR AFTER A 12 HOUR SHIFT OF WASHING DISHES THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS  TO BRING YOUR WORK HOME WITH YOU. SO YOU SEE, THE PROBLEM WITH INCREASING THE MARGINAL TAX RATE ON THE RICH AND CLOSING  CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLES ISN'T THAT IT ENGAGES IN CLASS WARFARE, IT IS THAT IT  IS FIGHTING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE WAR.
IT IS ALL OUT WAR ON THE PRODUCTIVE CLASS IN OUR SOCIETY FOR THE BENEFIT OF  THE MOOCHER CLASS.
THE MAKERS AND THE TAKERS. THEY WANT TO TAKE IT FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.
EVERYBODY IS JUMPING IN THE WAGON, NO ONE WANTS TO PULL.
PARASITES WE HAVE OUT THERE DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT.
THE RACCOONS, THEY'RE NOT STUPID. THEY'RE GOING TO SAY THEY ARE GOING TO DO THE EASY WAY IF WE MAKE IT EASY JUST LIKE  WELFARE RECIPIENTS ALL ACROSS AMERICA.
WELFARE WILL CREATE A GENERATIONS OF UTTERLY IRRESPONSIBLE ANIMALS.
Jon: YEAH. [BLEEP] THOSE PEOPLE! THE POOR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
