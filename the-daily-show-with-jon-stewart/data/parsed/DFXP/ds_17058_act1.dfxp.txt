Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  FEBRUARY 15, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT REPRESENTATIVE LOUISE SLAUGHTER WILL BE HERE VIA SATELLITE. SATELLITE. THAT'S RIGHT, SPACE. (LAUGHTER) OOH. HAPPY OH MY GOD YESTERDAY WAS VALENTINE'S DAY (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) THAT'S THE DAY WHEN YOU REMEMBER THAT YESTERDAY WAS VALENTINE'S DAY. AND NOW YOU'RE ALONE. (LAUGHTER) LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE STATE OF OUR CAPITAL MARKET. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF REQUESTS ON THE SHOW TO DO MORE CAPITAL MARKETS BITS. THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH A BIT OF A ROUGH PATCH. REPUTATIONS HAVE SUFFERED. NOT LEAST OF WHICH DUE TO A RASH OF INSIDER TRADING. WE KNOW INSIDER TRADING IS BAD. WHY ELSE WOULD JOHN CRYER'S DEAD BROTHER HAVE GONE TO JAIL IN THAT '80s MOVIE. YOU KNOW, THE MOVIE ABOUT... WALL STREET. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THAT MOVIE. BUT WHATEVER IT WAS. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND IT WAS NOT TOLERATED.
GOLDMAN SACHS TECHNOLOGY ANALYST IS REPORTED UNDER INVESTIGATION BY FEDERAL  AUTHORITIES FOR LEAKING INSIDE INFORMATION TO HEDGE FUNDS.
Jon: GOOD! (LAUGHTER) I'M GLAD. NOT THAT HE'S LEAKING. (LAUGHTER) I'M GLAD THAT PEOPLE TRADING ON SECRET INFORMATION WHICH  UNDERMINES THE VERY INTEGRITY OF OUR MARKETS IS A PROBLEM. YOU TRADE ON NONPUBLIC INFORMATION, YOU GET IN TROUBLE. THAT'S SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD INVESTIGATE. UNLESS THEY'RE DOING IT. FOR EXAMPLE, INSIDER TRADING ON THE STOCK MARKET. IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, THOSE LAWS ARE DEEMED NOT TO APPLY. THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF FORMS OF HONEST GRAFTS THAT CONGRESSMEN ENGAGE IN THAT ALLOW THEM TO  BECOME VERY, VERY WEALTHY.
Jon: JUST LIKE THE FOUNDING FATHERS INTENDED. (LAUGHTER) IT'S OUR SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. THEY T DEPOSIT CHECKS, IT INCREASES THEIR BALANCES. (LAUGHTER) LOOK, CONGRESSIONAL TRADING ON NONPUBLIC INFORMATION IS SURPRISINGLY COMMON. "60 MINUTES" REPORTED IN NOVEMBER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN SPENCER  BACHUS MADE INVESTMENTS AFTER CLOSED-DOOR BRIEFINGS ON THE ECONOMY. JOHN BOEHNER DABBLED IN INSURANCE STOCKS DURING THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE AND NANCY  PELOSI TOOK PART IN AN EXCLUSIVE VISA I.P.O. WHILE CONSIDERING LEGISLATION ON CREDIT CARDS. AND SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE ITTY-BITTY TITTY COMMITTEE ARE SHORTING THE OVER THE SHOULDER  BOLDER HOLDER MARKET AND HOW IS THAT NOT ILLEGAL AND HOW DID I STAY THAT WITHOUT TRIPPING UP ON  THE WORDS? I DON'T KNOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) REALLY? ARE YOUR STANDARDS FOR ME THAT LOW? (LAUGHTER) THIS GENTLEMAN GOT THROUGH ITTY-BITTY TITTY COMMITTEE. I SAY WE CARRY HIM OUT ON OUR SHOULDERS. LOOK, THE REPORT ON "60 MINUTES" MADE SOME REAL WAVES ON CAPITOL HILL. MEMBERS VOWED ACTION. WE MUST MAKE IT UNAMBIGUOUS THAT THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS ILLEGAL.
WE SHOULD NOT BE SHIELDING CONGRESS FROM LAWS THAT APPLY TO OTHER AMERICANS.
Jon: YES! CONGRESS SHOULD OBEY THE SAME LAWS AS EVERYONE ELSE. I BELIEVE THAT WAS IN THE NO (BLEEP) SHERLOCK ACT OF 2000 AND ALWAYS. THAT'S WHY LAST THURSDAY CONGRESS PASSED SOMETHING CALLED THE STOP TRADING ON  CONGRESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE, OR STOCK ACT. IT'S AN ACRONYM. IT WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT CONGRESS PEOPLE OR THEIR STAFF FROM BENEFITING FINANCIALLY FROM  INFORMATION THEY LEARNED IN THE COURSE OF BEING IN CONGRESS. SO NOW AT LONG LAST IF YOU'RE ON THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE YOU  CAN'T TRADE BANK STOCKS.
IF YOU'RE ON THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE, YOU'RE GOING  TO STILL BE ABLE TO TRADE BANK STOCK. (AUDIENCE REACTS). (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT SEEMS TO NOT BE SOLVING THE PROBLEM THEN. BUT TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE SIZE OF CONGRESS' BALL AND THE BILL'S  LACK OF THEM YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT ANOTHER PROVISION DEALING WITH SO-CALLED POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE. I'LL LET "60 MINUTES" EXPLAIN USING FOOTAGE OF PEOPLE WHOSE  FACES HAVE BEEN SURGICALLY REMOVED.
A WHOLE NEW TOTALLY UNREGULATED $100 MILLION INDUSTRY HAS GROWN UP IN  WASHINGTON CALLED POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE. IT EMPLOYS FORMER CONGRESSMEN AND FORMER STAFFERS TO SCOUR THE HALLS OF THE CAPITOL GATHERING  VALUABLE NONPUBLIC INFORMATION THEN SELLING IT TO HEDGE FUNDS.
Jon: HEADLESS ZOMBIES! ROAMING THE HALLS. THERE'S A WHOLE INDUSTRY OF PARASITES JUST RIDING ON THE BACKS OF OUR CONGRESS PEOPLE  LIKE TICKS ON A WATER BUFFALO OR MICE ON AN EAGLE. (LAUGHTER) I'M BEING TOLD THAT WAS NOT HOW MICE GET AROUND. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE AT WORK. A FIRM CALLED J.N.K. SECURITIES SET UP A MEETING BETWEEN SEVERAL HEDGE FUNDS AND SENATOR CHRIS  DODD, THE GUY THAT WROTE ALL THE FINANCIAL LEGISLATION. THE SENATOR TOLD THEM HE WOULDN'T BE PURSUING A PRO VISION TO CAP DEBIT CARD FEES. NO ONE OUTSIDE THE MEETING HAS THE INFORMATION. THEN ONE OF THE HEDGE FUNDS THAT WAS THERE BOUGHT OVER 300,000 SHARES IN VISA. HERE'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IF THE SAME TYPE OF ACTIVITY HAPPENS IN THE REGULAR NON-CONGRESS ECONOMY.
PRIMARY GLOBAL SALES MANAGER JAMES FLEISCHMAN GUILTY OF CONSPIRACY IN AN INSIDER TRADING CASE.
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FILED SUIT AGAINST ANGLO MA ZILLO, FORMER HEAD OF  COUNTRYWIDE MORTGAGE ACCUSING HIM OF INSIDER TRADING AND FRAUD.
A FORMER MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE NASDAQ HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING.
I FORMER GOLDMAN SACHS BOARD MEMBER HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING.
SENTENCED TO 11 YEARS IN PRISON, THE HARSHEST PUNISHMENT EVER FOR AN INSIDER TRADING CASE.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHO I BET FINDS THE JUXTAPOSITION OF WHAT CONGRESS PEOPLE CAN DO AND  REGULAR PEOPLE CAN DO HYSTERICAL? MARTHA STEWART. I BET SHE'S JUST LAUGHING AND LAUGHING AS SHE TAKES A RECLAIMED BARN WOOD BASEBALL  FOOT A SHELF FULL OF VASES SHE RAFTD FROM RECYCLED NEW ENGLANDC LOBSTER TRAPS. (LAUGHTER) SHE'S MAD. THE SENATE VERSION OF THE STOCK ACT DEALT WITH THESE POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE. IT DIDN'T BAN THEM FROM SHUTTLING INFORMATION FROM CONGRESS TO HEDGE FUNDS BUT IT  DID REQUIRE THEM TO DO ONE THING.
IT TAKES THESE PEOPLE THAT YOU CALL POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS AND HAVE THEM  REGISTER JUST LIKE EVERY LOBBYIST REGISTERS SO IT'S TOTALLY TRANSPARENT SO WHEN  THESE PEOPLE COME AROUND TO GET INFORMATION FROM YOU THAT THEY SELL TO HEDGE FUNDS...
Jon: OH, MY GOD, THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM REGISTER LIKE LOBBYISTS. NOW THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET IN AND SEE CONGRESS PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) EXCEPT ALWAYS. BUT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. DOES GIVE IT A LITTLE TRANSPARENCY. WHO COULD OBJECT TO THAT?
HOUSE REPUBLICANS REJECTED A PROVISION THAT REQUIRES SO-CALLED POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE  FIRMS TO REGISTER THE SAME AS LOBBYISTS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THANK YOU FOR TAKING (BLEEP) ON OUR CHESTS. NOW TO BE FAIR THE OPPONENTS OF REGISTERING POLITICAL OPERATIVES HAD A GOOD POINT.
THINK OF THE WORDING "POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE."  THERE'S SO MUCH QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS.
POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE IS DEFINED AS INFORMATION WHICH IS INTENDED FOR USE IN ANALYZING  SECURITIES OR COMMODITY MARKETS OR INFORMING INVESTMENT DECISIONS. BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
Jon: WHAT DOES IT MEAN? YOU WROTE THE (BLEEP) THING! WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DOES IT MEAN? YOU WROTE IT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) REALLY, LIEBERMAN? (AS LIEBERMAN) POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE, ARE THOSE EVEN WORDS? WHEN I SEE THE COLOR BLUE, DO I KNOW YOU'RE SEEING THE SAME COLOR I'M SEEING? I MEAN, WHAT IF CONGRESS IS JUST LIKE THE DREAM OF A SLEEPING BUTTERFLY? (LAUGHTER) YOU WRITE LAWS, NOT POETRY. BUT SUDDENLY SENATORS SOUND LIKE ENGLISH PROFESSORS. WELL, THAT SENTENCE, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU? (LAUGHTER) HERE'S WHAT I THINK IT MEANS, "PACK YOUR SHUTES, PEOPLES, NO ONE'S FLYING THIS (BLEEP)ING PLANE."
