WITHIN WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST THE MEDIA DIX EDITOR FOR "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND  FEATURED IN THE DOCUMENTARY FILM ABOUT THE TIMES CALLED "PAGE 1"
I'M GOING TO IRAQ.
HE'S DONE ALL THESE STORIES ON MEDIA COMPANIES AND CAPITOL CASES, DEATH ROW  AND TIM IS JUST ONE OF THE GUYS WHO WANTS ANSWERS TO REALLY BASIC QUESTIONS. I THINK ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT, YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS. IRAQ IS KIND OF OFF PEOPLE'S RADAR SCREENS HERE BUT WE STILL HAVE 120,000 SOLDIERS THERE. AND IT'S A REAL CRUCIAL POINT IN TERMS OF SEEING WHAT THE LAST CHAPTER IS FOR  OUR COUNTRY THERE.
PLEASE WELCOME BRUISE HEADLAM. -- BRUCE HEADLAMB. THANK YOU. NICE TO SEE YOU. (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU.
Jon: I WANT TO SAY WE HAD SCHEDULED TO INTERVIEW THE DIRECTOR.
YES.
Jon: WHO PUT THE FILM TOGETHER. BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS A LITTLE UNDER THE WEATHER AND COULDN'T MAKE IT. SO HE MADE YOU DO IT.
YES. AND WHEN YOU MENTIONED THE TIMES REVIEW I THINK HE FLAT LINED AT THE HOSPITAL. HE MAY BE GONE NOW.
Jon: LET ME JUST ASK YOU OBVIOUSLY THE QUESTIONS I WAS GOING TO ASK HIM. WHEN YOU WERE PUTTING THIS MOVIE TOGETHER, WERE THEY NERVOUS AT THE TIMES TO  ALLOW A FILMMAKER TO COME IN AND DOCUMENT THEIR PROCESS. WAS THERE ANY SORT OF INTERNAL DISCUSSION.
THERE WAS BECAUSE THE CREW THAT HAD BEEN FROM THE DAILY SHOW.
AND THAT HAD NOT GONE NEARLY SO WELL. THEY WERE SURPRISINGLY NOT NERVOUS. I WAS NERVOUS. I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT BUT IT WAS PRESENTED TO BE BY BILL KELLER MY BOSS, I SAID  ENOUGH OF MY REPORTERS WANTED TO DO IT I WOULD GO ALONG WITH IT. BUT I WASN'T IN FAVOR OF IT.
Jon: IT SORT OF A DEMOCRACY AT THE TIMES.
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.
Jon: VERY EXCITING.
YES.
Jon: LIKE A VELVET REVOLUTION OVER THERE. THAT'S EXCITING.
YEAH, YOU SAW THE PAGE 1 SCENE, TO SEE HOW DEMOCRATIC THEY ARE.
Jon: EXACTLY RIGHT. YOU LIVE LIKE ANTS IN YOUR CUBICLES. DOES THE TIMES, IS THE FEAR THERE THAT YOU KNOW, THE DOCUMENTARY IS SORT OF  CAPTURING THIS OBSOLETE TIME IN AMERICA, IT'S LIKE WE'LL LOOK BACK YEARS FROM NOW AND  BE LIKE THE OLD HORSES USED TO PULL ALL THE WAGONS AND THEN THE AUTOMOBILE CAME BY.
I DON'T THINK THE TIMES LOOKS AT ITSELF THAT WAY. I DON'T THINK THE FILM GETS THAT PARTICULARLY. YOU KNOW, I WAS SKEPTICAL BECAUSE I THOUGHT WELL, WE COVER THE MEDIA. WE'RE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TIMES. NOBODY IS SHOOTING AT US. WE COVER FOX NEWS. WHICH IS-- BY THE WAY, THEY LOVE YOU GUYS. I WAS OVER THERE ON SUNDAY.
WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DRIVE THROUGH CHECK POINTS TO GET TO FOX NEWS.
BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK THE TIMES FELT THERE WAS A STORY TO TELL. NOW THE MINUTE ANDREW STARTED FILMING WIKI LEAKS HAPPENED. WE HAD LAYOFFS. OUR STOCK PLUMMETED. MANY PEOPLE WERE PREDICTING OUR DEMISE. MANY PEOPLE WERE CHEERING OUR DEMISE. SO PROBABLY SIX MONTHS LATER I'M NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE WELCOMED ANDREW QUITE THE  WAY WE DID AT THAT POINT. BUT HE MANAGED TO CAPTURE A LOT OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING THAT YEAR AND A LOT OF THE DRAMA.
THE WIKI LEAKS STUFF IS THE MOST FASCINATING BECAUSE IT REPRESENTED THAT, YOU  KNOW, THEY HAVE BRIAN IN THERE WHO IS YOUNGER. AND SO HE I THINK MAYBE HAS A LITTLE MORE INSIGHT INTO THE SCENES WHERE HE IS SORT  OF INTERACTING WITH SOME OF THE OLDER, YOU KNOW, NO DISRESPECT.
NO DISRESPECT.
BUT IT JUST WAS KIND OF --
SLOWER, WEAKER.
Jon: IT WAS LIKE WAIT, YOU DON'T REIT TWITTER THAT IS KIND OF WHERE IT IS HAPPENING. LIKE HE HAS THERE IS A SENSE THAT HE WAS URGING EVERYBODY TO EMBRACE SOMETHING THAT  THERE WAS SOME RESISTENCE TOO.
AND BRIAN URGES ALL OF US TO EMBRACE TWITTER. I ENCOURAGE BRIAN TO SEND #ï¿½Q!AT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN HOLD YET. NO, I THINK HE'S A GOOD EXAMPLE, DAVID CARR WITHOUT AS MANY PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW IS  ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE. IT'S REALLY A PLACE IN TRANSITION. AND I DON'T WANT THE FILM TO BE SEEN AS A KIND OF OLD, GRUMPY, NEWSPAPER HERE AND HERE ARE THE COOL KIDS OVER HERE. IT'S MUCH MORE FLUID. THE TIMES WEB SITE IS A MASSIVE WEB SITE. ON TWIRT, ON FACEBOOK, THEY DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS.
Jon: IT STILL FEELS LIKE CONTENT IS ALWAYS KING. IF YOU ESTABLISH, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THE TIMES EDITORIAL AUTHORITY IS NOT WHAT IT WAS BUT IF YOU ESTABLISH THE  IDEA OF TRUSTED CONTENT, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHERE IT IS DISTRIBUTED.
WELL, THE ONE DIFFERENCE IT MAKES IS THAT WE MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY IN A  NEWSPAPER THAN WE DO ON-LINE. AND THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HUGE STRUGGLES WHICH IS THE FINANCIAL UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR BUSINESS.
Jon: WHY IS THAT. BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE OTHER SITES THAT ARE ON-LINE THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN  FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY DO. AND THEY'RE SELLING FOR $10 BILLION AT IPOs. IT'S JUST LIKE AN ON-LINE SITE, EVERYBODY, LET'S GET TOGETHER AND WE'LL ALL GET A  DISCOUNT ON A MASSAGE. AND THAT IPO GOES FOR, YOU KNOW, WHY ISN'T ON-LINE ADVERTISING, BECAUSE THAT IS  WHERE THEY ARE ALL ARE.
BECAUSE ONE REASON IS YOU KNOW WE'RE IN BAGHDAD. AND THAT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY. THE COST BEHIND THOSE SITES IS NOT THAT GREAT.
RIGHT.
IF THEY ARE OFFERING MASSAGES IN BAGHDAD IT WOULD BE A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY. THEN WE WOULD BE ON EQUAL GROUND.
Jon: I THINK I MEANT LIKE WHY DOESN'T ADVERTISING, WHY ISN'T THE RATE MORE  COMMENSURATE WITH THE WAY THAT TECHNOLOGY IS --
BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH OF IT. WITH "THE NEW YORK TIMES" THERE'S SCARCITY, TIFFANIES HAS BEEN ON PAGE THREE FOR  GOD KNOWS, A SENT REE. YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY WEB SITES, MANY LOW COST WAYS TO REACH TEAM. -- PEOPLE. THE ON-LINE ADVERTISING IS NOT AS LUCRATIVE RIGHT NOW AS ADVERTISING IN THE PAPER.
Jon: DO YOU THINK THE TIMES WILL BE ABLE TO BE AS AGILE, CONTINUE TO DO THE  TYPE OF REPORTING. BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SITES, STILL RELY ON TIMES REPORTING. IT'S NOT LIKE THE TIMES REPORTING IS NOT OUT THERE AND DISSEMINATED EVERYWHERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST GO THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
THE TIMES IS THE GREAT STRAIGHT LINE OF AMERICA. EVERYBODY ELSE GETS TO TELL THE JOKES OFF WHAT WE DO.
Jon: WHAT? (LAUGHTER) WELL, WELL, WELL.
WELL. IT'S COME TO THIS.
Jon: SO WE MEET AT LAST. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, REALLY INTERESTING LOOK AT IT. I'M GLAD THAT YOU GUYS DID IT.
I'M GLAD WE DID TOO.
Jon: AND LET A REAL FILMMAKER DO IT RATHER THAN JUST COMEDIANS RIDICULING  YOU FOR FOUR MINUTES. THANK YOU FOR COMING IN AND TAKING THE DIRECTOR'S PLACE. REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANKS SO MUCH.
Jon: TAKE ONE IN SELECT CITIES NOW, BRUCE HEAD
