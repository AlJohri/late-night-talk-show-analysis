Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A HELL OF A PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE GREAT J.J. ABRAMS WILL BE JOINING US. OR MAYBE HE WON'T BE JOINING US. MAYBE HE'LL BE IN SOME SORT OF PURGATORY/TALK SHOW/IN THE FUTURE-PAST. (LAUGHTER) IT'S A TALK SHOW CALLED "TALK SANCTUM 4,000" OH, REALLY? IT SUCKED. OKAY. WILL HAVE WILL HAVE APPARENTLY MY IDEAS SUCK. BY THE WAY, EXCITING DAY TODAY. I GOT A KID IN THE AUDIENCE WHO BROKE THE WORLD RECORD FOR AMOUNT OF TIME WITH YOUR MOM IN A CAR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 11 HOURS TOGETHER. 11 HOURS. NOT ONLY ARE THEY BOTH STILL ALIVE-- (LAUGHTER) -- THEY'RE STILL SITTING NEXT TO EACH OTHER. IT WAS THREE FILL-UPS OF GAS, TWO XANAX AND... (LAUGHTER) LET'S GO TO OR ONGOING COVERAGE OF "INDECISION 2012."  LAST NIGHT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS GATHERED ON THE SET OF THE WORLD'S MOST  PATRIOTIC GAME SHOW. AMERICA'S GOT AMERICA! TO ENGAGE IN THEIR PARTY'S SECOND DEBATE. AND IF YOU THINK THIS DEBATE WAS GOING TO BE LIKE EVERY OTHER PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE YOU'VE EVER  SEEN, YOU'VE GOT (BLEEP) FOR BRAINS.
TONIGHT'S DEBATE WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE YOU'VE EVER SEEN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. EACH CANDIDATE TONIGHT HAS BEEN POISONED. (LAUGHTER) AND HAS BUT THREE HOURS TO LIVE. OH, THERE'S AN ANECDOTE-- HIDDEN IN A BOX. (LAUGHTER) BEING SAT UPON BY A GAY MARRIED COUPLE. (LAUGHTER) AND DID I MENTION IT'S WRAPPED IN THE ONLY ORIGINAL COPY OF OUR  NATION'S CONSTITUTION. TO GET THE ANECDOTE, YOU MUCH TOUCH THE MARRIED GAYS AND RIP OUR CONSTITUTION! QUITE DIABOLICAL. HA, HA, HA, HA. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, I GUESS I'LL LET JOHN KING... I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY  DON'T PUT ME IN MORE MOVIES. (LAUGHTER) I'LL LET JOHN KING TELL YOU WHY THIS DEBATE IS DIFFERENT.
IN ADDITION TO QUESTIONS FROM MYSELF AND JOURNALISTS FROM OUR  PARTNERS, CANDIDATES WILL TAKE QUESTIONS DIRECTLY FROM VOTEERS RIGHT HERE IN MANCHESTER AS WELL  AS HAVE FROM VOTERS AT TOWN MEETINGS TAKING PLACE TONIGHT ALL ACROSS NEW HAMPSHIRE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW THE (BLEEP) IS THAT DIFFERENT? (LAUGHTER) YOU MEAN LIKE THE DEBATE A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHERE EVERYONE HAS QUESTIONS ON YOUTUBE? COME ON. ACTUALLY, CNN ASKED FOR AND GOT SOME PRETTY GOOD QUESTIONS FROM TWITTER AND FACEBOOK.
LOT OF GOOD QUESTIONS. WOULD YOU HAVE RELEASED THE BIN LADEN PHOTOS? WOULD YOU SUPPORT ISSUES... GOOD QUESTIONS FROM OUR VIEWERS THERE WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHAT? NO, DON'T... NOT RIGHT BACK. NORVIN A. WENT TO TROUBLE COMING UP WITH A QUESTION AND YOU'RE NOT GOING ASK IT? WHAT KNOCKED THAT QUESTION OFF THE TABLE?
ELVIS OR JOHNNY CASH? "DANCING WITH THE STARS" OR AMERICAN IDOL. LENO OR CONAN? DEEP DISH OR THIN CRUST? BLACKBERRY OR IPHONE? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I HAVE A FOLLOW UP. CRAZY BREAD OR CHUR ROS? (LAUGHTER) CASH OR CREDIT? OH, WAIT, I'M SORRY, WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH CANDIDATES IS BEST QUALIFIED TO  PERHAPS RUN AMERICA. ARE THERE ANY HASHTAG INNOVATIVE WWW./DEBATE (BLEEP)ING ANNOYING TV.TV/BIEBER YOU HAVE UP YOUR  SLEEVE BEFORE WE MOVE ON?
YOU'LL SEE AN ELECTRONIC CODE ON YOUR SCREEN. YOU CAN SNAP A PICTURE OF THAT CODE, YOU'LL GET EXCLUSIVE ACCESS ABOUT OUR DEBATES, BEHIND-THE-SCENES VIDEO, ANALYSIS AND CONTENT.
YOU'RE SUGGESTING WHILE I WATCH THIS DEBATE I GET OUT MY  PHONE AND TAKE A PICTURE OF THE SCREEN WATCHING A MOBILE DEVICE INTERNET BROWSE FILLED WITH  ANOTHER SCREEN FILLED WITH CONTENT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO PUT ON YOUR 24 HOUR SEVEN DAY A WEEK  WHY DON'T YOU TEXT US TO VOTE ON WHAT STORY YOU WANT TO SEE LAZY SUSAN OF STUPID (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) I WATCH WAY TOO MUCH CNN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ACTUALLY... I APOLOGIZE, IT DOES SOUND LIKE A COOL IDEA. GO AHEAD, TAKE A PICTURE. (LAUGHTER) IT WILL BRING YOU TO A VERY INFORMATIVE WEB SITE. (LAUGHTER) DON'T DO IT NOW, THOUGH, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WE'RE DOING A SHOW. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, TRIVIALITIES ASIDE, IT WAS TIME FOR THE DEBATE WHICH BEGAN FOR THE TRADITIONAL  COMPARING OF THE CHRISTMAS CARDS.
THE FATHER OF TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS.
FATHER OF TWO, GRANDFATHER OF THREE.
SEVEN CHILDREN.
FIVE SONS, AS YOU KNOW, FIVE DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW. 16 GRAND KIDS.
I'VE GIVEN BIRTH TO FIVE BABIES AND I'VE TAKEN 23 FOSTER CHILDREN INTO MY HOME.
Jon: WE HAVE A WINNER. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) AND I JUST WANT TO ASK EVERYONE ELSE HERE UP ON THE DAIS, HAVE  YOU EVER HAD TO DIVIDE A BIRTHDAY CAKE INTO 28 EQUAL PIECES? BY THE WAY, THE ONLY CANDIDATE NOT TO MENTION HIS KIDS AT ALL WAS NEWT GINGRICH. ALTHOUGH HE DID THE OTHERS TO A MOST-WIVES CONTEST. (LAUGHTER) CONSECUTIVE, NOT CONCURRENT. NICE TRY, ROMNEY. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THE BABY-OFF WAS REALLY JUST A PROXY BATTLE FOR THE REAL BATTLE. THE PRO-LIFE OFF.
I BELIEVE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT I'M FIRMLY PRO-LIFE.
I STAND FOR THE RIGHT TO LIFE.
NOT ONLY HAVE I BEEN CONSISTENTLY PRO-LIFE BUT I'VE  TAKEN... I'VE NOT JUST TAKEN THE PLEDGE, I'VE TAKEN THE BULLETS. THE "NATIONAL REVIEW" ONLINE, WHICH IS THE CONSERVATIVE PUBLICATION SAID BASED ON RESULTS, NOT JUST BASED ON WORDS  I WAS PROBABLY THE MOST PRO-LIFE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE.
MY FAVORITE MAGAZINE? YEAH. (LAUGHTER) FAVORITE BOARD GAME? NO DOUBT. (LAUGHTER) MY FAVORITE GARRETT? CLOSE. CLOSE. LEIF. (LAUGHTER) MY FAVORITE WORD TO IMAGINE A NATIVE OF CHINA STEREO TYPICALLY MISPRONOUNCING? (LAUGHTER) I KNEW I WAS GOING TO NAIL ONE OF THEM. OF COURSE, AT A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY DEBATE IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO GET TRIPPED UP BY  ADHERING TOO CLOSELY TO YOUR IDEOLOGY. UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOUR IDEOLOGY IS LIBERTARIAN.
A FIVE-YEAR-OLD CHILD OF AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WALKS INTO THE  EMERGENCY ROOM, DOES THE CHILD GET CARE?
FIRST OFF, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THE MANDATES. WE BANKRUPT IT HAD HOSPITALS AND THE SCHOOLS IN TEXAS AND OTHER. WE CAN'T GIVE THEM EASY CITIZENSHIP. WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT PROTECTING OUR BORDERS.
AT A TIME WHEN GOVERNMENT WASN'T... WE DIDN'T DEPEND ON  GOVERNMENT FOR EVERYTHING!
FREEDOM HAS SOLVED THESE KIND OF PROBLEMS BEFORE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE CARE AND EVERYBODY  WILL STARVE TO DEATH AND DIE ON THE STREETS WITHOUT MEDICAL CARE. THAT'S THE IMPLICATION OF THE QUESTION. THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE AND YOU SHOULDN'T ACCEPT IT.
Jon: I'M SORRY, CONGRESSMAN PAUL, THE CORRECT ANSWER IS YES. (LAUGHTER) YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIVE-YEAR-OLD SHOULD GET EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT. YES. MEANWHILE, THE NICE CLEAR ALPHA CANDIDATE, MITT ROMNEY, WHOSE FRONT-RUNNER STATUS AND  DISTINGUISHED ONLY MY SIDE BURNS SAW A GHOST HAIRDO (LAUGHTER) ...
ALLOWED TIME ABILITY-- AND I'M SPEAKING RELATIVELY-- TO MODERATE HIS POSITION. LIKE WHEN ROMNEY WAS ASKED ABOUT EXCLUDING MUSLIMS FROM HIS CABINET.
NO, I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS ARE WELCOME IN THIS COUNTRY. OUR NATION WAS FOUNDED ON A PRINCIPLE OF RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE.
Jon: WOW. OKAY. WOW. TERRIFIC. WELL, LET'S JUST... THAT WAS JUST...
I JUST WANT TO COMMENT FOR A SECOND.
Jon: OH. (LAUGHTER) YES. THE ARTIST FORMERLY KNOWN AS NEWT GINGRICH.
THE PAKISTANI WHO EMIGRATED TO THE U.S., BECAME A CITIZEN, BUILT A CAR BOMB WHICH LUCKILY FAILED TO OFF GO OFF IN TIMES SQUARE WAS ASKED BY THE FEDERAL  JUDGE HOW COULD SHE DONE THAT WHEN HE SWORE AN OATH TO THE UNITED STATES AND HE LOOKED AT  THE JUDGE AND HE SAID "YOU'RE MY ENEMY. I LIED." I AM IN FAVOR OF SAYING TO PEOPLE IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO  BE LOYAL TO THE UNITED STATES YOU WILL NOT SERVE IN MY ADMINISTRATION, PERIOD.
Jon: SO THE POINT OF YOUR STORY IS PEOPLE LIE WHEN THEY SWEAR OATHS OF LOYALTY TO THE  UNITED STATES AND YOUR SOLUTION IS I WILL SAY TO THESE PEOPLE... (LAUGHTER) ... THEY DON'T DO THAT. (LAUGHTER) BUT THE MOST ANTICIPATED MATCHUP WAS NOT GINGRICH/ROMNEY BUT IN  FACT PAWLENTY/ROMNEY ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT HE DESIGNED OBAMACARE AFTER ROMNEY CARE AND BASICALLY MADE IT OBAMNEYCARE.
Jon: OH, NO YOU DIDN'T! TWO NAMES TOGETHER WITH CARE IS LIKE THE BRANGELINA OF SOCIALIZED MEDICINE! OH, DAMN. IT'S ON!
YOUR RIVAL IS STANDING RIGHT THERE. IF IT WAS OBAMNEYCARE ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY, WHY IS IT NOT OBAMNEYCARE STANDING HERE WITH  THE GOVERNOR?
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS THE PERSON I QUOTED IN SAYING HE LOOKED TO  MASSACHUSETTS FOR DESIGNING HIS PROGRAM. HE'S THE ONE WHO SAID IT'S A BLUEPRINT AND THAT HE MERGED THE  TWO PROGRAMS AND SO USING THE TERM OBAMNEYCARE WAS A REFLECTION OF THE PRESIDENT'S  COMMENT THAT HE DECIDED OBAMACARE ON THE MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH CARE PLAN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DID I SAY OBAMNEYCARE? I MEANT TO SAY OBAPALIN CARE. SHE'S NOT HERE, RIGHT? OBAPALINCARE. THAT'S WHAT I MEANT TO SAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) STILL, THE NIGHT WAS A SURE-FIRE SUCCESS, AT LEAST ACCORDING TO  THE ONLY METRIC THAT MATTERS TO CNN.
SEVEN CANDIDATES UP ON STAGE AS THEY TRY TO IMPRESS VOTERS OF  NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THE COUNTRY. WE'VE BECOME, WE ARE TOLD, A TRENDING TOPIC ON TWITTER.
Jon: A TRENDING TOPIC! (LAUGHTER) YOU MADE IT! YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THIS WHEN IT WAS NATIONALLY BROADCAST ON TELEVISION. BUT TRENDING ON TWITTER! (LAUGHTER) IN FACT, THE DEBATE WAS TWITTER TOPIC NUMBER THREE RIGHT UP THERE BETWEEN HASHTAG BIG  MISTAKE AND HASHTAG WATCHING CABLE. -- TEEN WOLF. KEEP IN MIND, THAT'S ALSO A REFERENCE TO SOMETHING THAT WAS  ON CNN, IT'S BLITZER'S NEW SHO
