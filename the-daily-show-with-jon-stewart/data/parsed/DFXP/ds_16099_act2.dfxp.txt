Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. I MAY HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER -- THOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHAT DAY IT  IS -- I DID SPEND THE WEEKEND IN AFGHANISTAN AT THE NEW SANDALS RESORT THEY OPENED UP THERE. NO WATER JUST ACTUAL SANDALS. [LAUGHTER] IT WAS A USO TOUR LED BY THE LEADER OF THE JOINT CHIEFS. WHEN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY ALLOW MED TO GO WITH THEM. THEY ARE STILL DOING THE TOUR. I HAD TO COME BACK. THE GREAT PEOPLE AT THE USO. IT WAS A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY. I MEAN THIS LITERALLY IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE MADE SOME PROMISES TO  SOME OF OUR INCREDIBLE SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN, THINGS LIKE, THEY GO WOULD YOU WEAR THIS SHIRT ON  YOUR SHOW AND I'D LIKE BE (bleep) YEAH. AND THEY BE LIKE HOW ABOUT THIS SFWHUN AND I'D BE LIKE OKAY. SO IN THE INTEREST OF HONORING AS MANY AS I POSSIBLY CAN IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME FOR JUST A MOMENT. HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT! THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] HUH! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ARGHH! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SIGNED BY LIEUTENANT PHILIPS AND THE REST OF THE INTELLIGENCE TEAM. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TRIP. I VISITED MANY FOBS, FORWARD OPERATING BASES. THEY GIVE YOU PATCHES WHEN THEY MEET YOU THAT DESCRIBE WHO THEY ARE AND WHERE THEY ARE FROM. THESE ARE SOME OF THEM. I URGE YOU TO TIVO THE SCREEN, FREEZE IT AND TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE GREAT MEN AND WOMEN OUT THERE DOING THAT. THIS ONE WAS GIVEN BY A SOLDIER WHOSE LAST NAME WAS SIMILAR TO MINE. AT WHICH POINT I SAID TO THIS SOLDIER, WELL, THEN WHO ARE YOU? [LAUGHTER] SO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AND I WAS HANDED HANDED SOME NOTES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME, I HAVE A FEW THINGS I NEED TO SAY. FIRST SHOUT OUT TO GI JEW IN KANDAHAR. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY GOOD LUCK WITH THAT NICKNAME OUT THERE. KANDAHAR AIR FIELD, WHEN PEOPLE SAY -- AND BY THE WAY THIS IS WRITING THAT I DID ON THE PLANE  I CAN BLAIRLY READ MY -- BLURRY. WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WAR AND THEY SAY THEY ARE IN THE (bleep) I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT  THE (bleep) CAME IN POND FORM. OR WOULD BE PLACED CLOSE TO YOUR DINING HALL. TO BAGRAM AIR FORCE BASE I'LL NEVER FORGET OUR NIGHT AT THE CLAM SHELL OR THE FACT THAT ONE  OF YOUR SOLDIERS TOLD ME THAT MY METS HAT WAS CONSIDERED AN UNACCEPTABLE RISK AND THAT'S WHY  I WAS GIVEN THIS ONE. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TO THE PERIOD TO OPERATING BASE DBIR RON MOW IT WAS THE BEST CHO IN TOWN, NO QUESTION. IT WOULD BE NICE IF SOMEONE WARNED ME THAT IT COULD GET HOT ENOUGH THERE FOR MY ASS CHEEKS  TO FUSE TOGETHER. [LAUGHTER] TO THE PILOT OF THE OSPREY WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF WE CLOSED THAT BACK HATCH. [LAUGHTER] TO FOB DELI, NO IT WAS NOT PRETTY MILD THAT DAY. [LAUGHTER] BUT THANK YOU FOR WARNING ME THAT THE AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY GUYS THAT WE MET WOULD NOT  UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE WHO I AM --  [LAUGHTER] -- OR SARCASM. [LAUGHTER] TO A COUPLE OF FOBS I'M NOT REALLY ALLOWED TO MENTION THEIR NAMES BECAUSE OF THINGS GOING ON  THERE, I WANT TO SAY YOUR TENACITY AND BRAVERY ARE OUTSTANDING AND INSPIRING BUT I  WANT ONE OF YOU TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOUR MESS SHAL DECORATED LIKE A 1940'S BROTHEL. [LAUGHTER] TO THE NATO ALLIES WE MET, THE TROOPS FROM THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT GIVE SO MUCH, YOUR SERVICE  IS MUCH APPRECIATED BUT THAT'S NOT EXCUSE TO INTRODUCE WHEETABIX TO OUR TROOPS. IT'S NOT A BREAKFAST, IT'S A BUILDING MATERIAL. TO THE SOLDIER I MET FROM MACEDONIA AND -- IN KABUL HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M IN THE THE MOST  FAMOUS PERSON IN AMERICA? [LAUGHTER] TO FIRST LIEUTENANT MOORE AND MASTER AT ARMS CART WRITE, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. TO LISA, YOUR HUSBAND IS RIGHT, DON'T LEAVE HIM FOR ME I'M NOT THAT FUNNY. I DO HAVE WRITERS. TO THE YOUNG SPECIALIST TO THE 655th TC WHO WROTE ME ONE OF THE NICEST LETTERS I THINK I'VE  EVER RECEIVED. I THANK YOU FOR IT. HE HAD A PIECE OF ADVICE IN IT, WE COOPERATE AND WE FIGHT AS HARD AS WE CAN BECAUSE THE -- WE COOPERATE AND WE FIGHT AS HARD  AS WE CAN BECAUSE THERE WILL BE PERHAPS DISAPPOINTMENT BUT THERE WILL BE NO SHAME. I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I THANK YOU GUYS. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE WEEKEND. I CAN'T REALLY PUT IT INTO WORDS. I DO WANT TO SAY PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT STRATEGIES AND POLITICAL AND FOREIGN POLICY AND  THINGS OF THAT NATURE BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED  SERVICES ARE GIVING SO MUCH TO OUR COUNTRY AND THE TASK THAT THEY ARE PERFORMING IS A COMPLEX ONE. IT'S NUANCED. THE PATIENCE THAT THEY DISPLAY, THE TENACITY AND THE COMPETENCE THEY DISPLAY ARE ASTONISHING AND THEY DOING IT ON A SURFACE THAT  AT TIMES RESEMBLES WHEN I ASSUME TO BE VENUS. I CANNOT THANK YOU ALL ENOUGH. YOU ARE AMAZING PEOPLE. THANK YOU FOREIGN SHARING THIS WE ME -- THA
