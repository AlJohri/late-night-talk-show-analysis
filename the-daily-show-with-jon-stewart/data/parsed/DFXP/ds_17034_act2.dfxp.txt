(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS HEATING UP AND IT'S HIT ON A NEW HOT-BUTTON  ISSUE: THE POOR. HERE TO DISCUSS IT, SENIOR POVERTY CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE. LARRY, THANKS FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU, JOHN. JON, I'M EXCITED. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A NEW FRONT-RUNNER, AN IDEA MAN WHO'S NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON A TOUGH  ISSUE LIKE POVERTY.
REALLY POOR CHILDREN IN REALLY POOR NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE NO HABITS OF WORKING. AND HAVE NOBODY AROUND THEM WHO WORKS. SO THEY HAVE NO HABIT OF SHOWING UP ON MONDAY.
I'M SPEECHLESS, JON. HAS HE EVER HEARD OF THE WORKING SNORE DOES HE THINK IF YOU HAVE TWO JOBS THEY CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WELL, GINGRICH DID TAKE HEAT FOR THAT COMMENT AND HE CLARIFY IT HAD COMMENT SOON AFTER.
SOME PEOPLE WHO SUGGEST THAT THE WORKING POOR BY DEFINITION  KNOW HOW TO WORK, WHICH IS TRUE, THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED THE WORKING POOR. I WAS TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO COME OUT OF AREAS AND NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY MAY NOT  HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE.
OKAY, HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT POOR PEOPLE, HE'S TALKING ABOUT POOR BLACK PEOPLE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) CHUCK, COULD YOU CHANGE MY... OH, THANK YOU. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BUT LARRY HE DIDN'T SAY BLACK.
NO, JON, THOSE ARE HIS EXACT WORDS. HE SAID "IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY MAY NOT HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE." (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S CODE FOR BLACK?
NO, IT'S CODE FOR INNER CITY WHICH IS CODE FOR URBAN WHICH IS CODE FOR BLACK. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: THAT'S A LOT OF CODES.
WELL, JON, IT'S 2011, YOU CAN'T JUST CALL POOR BLACK PEOPLE LAZY.
Jon: HE DIDN'T USE THE WORD "LEI ZI" EITHER.
RIGHT, HE SAID WE HAVE NO HABIT OF SHOWING UP ON MONDAY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: CODE FOR LAZY.
WELL, TECHNICALLY CODE FOR SHIFTLESS WHICH IS CODE FOR LAZY WHICH IS CODE FOR BLACK. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WELL, IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE MAKING A LEAP THAT HE'S  TALKING ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE. SHOULDEN WE GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT?
WELL, MAYBE, BUT LET'S PLAY A LITTLE MORE.
WE HAVE 43% BLACK TEENAGE UNEMPLOYMENT. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: ALL RIGHT... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOOK, SHOULDN'T NEWT GINGRICH GET CREDIT FOR ADDRESSING WHAT  IS A REAL ISSUE-- BLACK POVERTY?
RIGHT, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A BLACK POVERTY, JON, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST POVERTY. OKAY? WE CAN'T EVEN BE POOR AS GOOD AS YOU GUYS? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LARRY, THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT... I MEAN, YOU'RE... (LAUGHTER). I'M ALL SCREWED UP NOW!
JON, SOMEHOW WHEN BLACK PEOPLE ARE POOR IT'S THEIR FAULT. THEY'RE ON WELFARE AND LAZY BUT IN POOR WHITE APPALACHIA IT'S  NOT A PROBLEM, IT'S CHINA'S FAULT OR INDIA'S FAULT OR ALL  THE MONEY WE'RE SPENDING ON BLACK PEOPLE ON WELFARE. I'M SORRY, INNER CITY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY RECIPIENTS. CODE, JON. > Jon: I GET IT..> BUT DOES IT MATTER WHOSE FAULT IT IS?
YES, JON! IT DOES. IT MATTERS TO THE SOLUTION. HERE'S GINGRICH'S.
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF INNER CITY SCHOOLS AND POOR NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS ACTUALLY  HIRED THE CHILDREN TO DO THINGS. WHAT IF THEY CLEANED OUT THE BATHROOMS AND WHAT IF THEY MOP IT HAD FLOORS? (AUDIENCE REACTS) SEE, JON? SO HIS PLAN TO FIX AMERICA IS FOR BLACK KIDS TO START CLEANING TOILETS? HEY, WHAT'D YOU LEARN IF SCHOOL TODAY, SON? I LEARNED BLACK PEOPLE NEED TO CHEW THEIR FOOD BETTER, DAD. HE WANTS TO GIVE KIDS JOBS BY FIRING THEIR PARENTS FROM ONE OF THE FEW JOBS THEY CAN GET.
Jon: I'M SURE HE HAD GOOD REASON.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BECOME A PIMP OR PROSTITUTE OR DRUG DEALER. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: WOW.
YUP. DREAM BIG, BLACK PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A PIMP, PROSTITUTE OR DRUG DEALER, YOU COULD CLEAN UP PEOPLE'S (BLEEP). (APPLAUSE) HEY! COME ON! GINGRICH, 2012! YES, WE CLEAN. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: LARRY WILMORE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
