Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, TODAY IS SUPER TUESDAY. I HOPE YOU SENT FLOWERS TO YOUR SUPER. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT DID YOU KNOW SUPER TUESDAY IS A POLITICAL EVENT AS WELL WITH TEN STATES UP FOR GRABS IN  THE HIGHLY CONTESTED REPUBLICAN PRIMARY THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES PAID SPECIAL ATTENTION TO  APPARENTLY THE MOST IMPORTANT STATE ISRAEL. THAT'S RIGHT. EACH ONE TOOK TIME TODAY FROM THE BIGGEST PRIMARY YET TO ADDRESS THE AMERICAN ISRAELI  POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE. THEY LOVE ISRAEL NOT LIKE THAT OTHER GUY THEY ARE RUNNING RUNNING TO REPLACE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS THE WORST RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE OF ISRAEL ANY PRESIDENT HAS HAD.
HE'S AFRAID TO STAND UP TO IRAN.
ISRAEL LOOKS AT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SHE DO NOT SEE A FRIEND.
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF BELIEVE HE THREW ISRAEL UNDER THE BUS.
Jon: WHEREAS I MITT ROMNEY WILL RETREF FROM THAT BUS AND POSTHUMOUSLY BAPTIZE IT THUS  SAVING ITS SOUL. EVEN MEL GIBSON AND JOHN GALLIANO ARE LIKE WHO, OBAMA TAKE IT DOWN. IT WAS SURPRISING THAT BARACK OBAMA ALSO APEERD AT APAC. HE'S GOING TO TEAR THEM A NEW ONE.
ISRAEL'S SECURITY IS SACK ROW SAINGT. IT'S NONKNEE GHOSHABLE. IT GUIDED MY ACTIONS AS PRESIDENT.
Jon: THAT SOUNDS PRETTY NICE. THIS IS MORE POSITIVE THAN I THOUGHT. I GUESS WE CAN SIT.
MY ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL SECURITY HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED. WE'LL DO WHAT IT TAKES TO PRESERVE ISRAEL'S QUAWL TATIVE MILITARY EDGE. THERE'S NO LASTING PEACE UNLESS ISRAEL'S SECURITY CONCERNS ARE MET. THE CHIPS ARE DOWN I HAVE ISRAEL'S BACK. ♪ I SO IN LOVE WITH YOU ♪  [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: GET A STOOKA YOU TWO. IT'S A FREE STANDING STRUCTURE FOR CELEBRATING THE HOLIDAY THAT COMEM RATES THE RITUAL OF HARVEST. THE REFERENCE WOULD HAVE KILLED THERE. I INTERRUPTED THE PRESIDENT.
WHIT COMES TO PREVENTING IRAN FROM GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON  I'LL TAKE NO OPTIONS OFF THE TABLE. I MEAN WHAT I SAY. IT'S AN POLITICAL EFFORT, ECONOMIC EFFORT --
Jon: IS HE GOING TO SAY? A MILITARY EFFORT TO BE PREPARED FOR ANY CONTINGENCY.
Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT. THAT'S GIET WHO HATES ISRAEL. BASICALLY THE PARAMETERS FOR DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES WILL ISRAEL RANGE FROM I  UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORT THEM AND MIGHT BOMB IRAN TO I UNEQUIF QUICKLY SUPPORT THEM AND WILL  DEFINITELY BOMB IRAN. THERE ARE PROMINENT POLITICIANS WILLING TO CRITICIZE THE ISRAELI P GOVERNMENT EVEN SAYING THICK  ISRAEL IS ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED. OR NETANYAHU'S WORDS ON IRAN SOUND LIKE A CALCULATED PREPARATION FOR A RECKLESS ADVENTURE. OR ISRAEL IS MAKING A MISTAKE -- I WOULD LOVE TO PLAY SOUND BITES OF THOSE QUOTES BECAUSE THEY ARE  IN HEBREW BECAUSE IN ISRAEL YOU ARE ALLOWED TO CRITICIZE ISRAEL ADD STILL
