JUNE 7th, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW  WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MIRE GUEST TONIGHT, EDWARD CONARD, HE ARGUES IN HIS NEW BOOK THAT INCOME EQUALITY  MAY NOT BE SUCH A TERRIBLE THING. THE RICH COULD PAY FEWER TAXESMENT I'M SURE OUR CONVERSATION WILL BE BRIEF. BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A MORNING, SPECIFICALLY MORNING JOE WHOSE HOST, ONE  JOSEPH P MORNING WAS A BIT UP SET ABOUT AN ARTICLE HE HAD SEEN IN TODAY'S "NEW  YORK TIMES" HOME SECTION TELLING THE CONSTRUCTION AT MITT ROMNEY'S LA JOLLA HOME  AND WHAT MR. MORNING FELT WAS AN UNFAIR ATTEMPT TO SMEAR MR. ROMNEY AS RICH, AN  ELITIST, OUT OF TOUCH.
DID "THE NEW YORK TIMES" EVER DISPATCH REPORTERS TO JOHN KERRY'S HOMESMENT  BECAUSE JOHN KERRY IS WORTH A LOT MORE MONEY, OBVIOUSLY, THAN MITT ROMNEY.
IF YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE OUT THERE CAN SHOW ME THIS TYPE OF SPREAD FROM  FOUR-- FROM EIGHT YEARS AGO ON JOHN KERRY AND HIS MASSIVE ACCUMULATIONS, AND ON TERESA HEINZ KERRY.
Jon: WOW. WELL, I GUESS IF "THE NEW YORK TIMES" DID DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT WOULD TOTALLY  TAKE THE WIND OUT OF THIS MAN'S COMPLAINT. IS THERE A WAY TO FIND OUT. IT'S A LIVE TELEVISION SHOW. EVERYBODY IS WORKING-- WHAT'S THAT BE, WILLIE GEIST, THE GUY NEXT TO MR. SCARBOROUGH AND HAS ACCESS TO THE INTERNET.
I HAVE PIECE FOR YOU.
OKAY.
FROM OCTOBER 10th, 2004, IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW THE PERCEPTION OF JOHN KERRY'S  ELITISM, THE COUPLE HAVE AN 18 CENTURY TOWN HOUSE, A KITCHEN TWO STORIES HIGH, AN  88 ACRE PITTSBURGH AREA ESTATE, PRIVATE GULF STREAM JET N WINTER HE GOES HELICOPTER SKIING WHILE  STAYING AT HIS WIFE'S IDAHO RETREAT, A 15th CENTURY FARMHOUSE TRANSPORTED FROM  ENGLAND AND REASSEMBLED ON THE BANKS OF THE BIG WOOD RIVER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HE ALSO HAD 15th CENTURY SERF CLONED AND REANIMATED BY SCIENTISTSMENT  BUT SO WHAT, SO THE LATTE LEFTIST OF THE TIMES ONCE BURIED A KERRY ELITISM STORY  ON PAGE-- A1 OF THE POPULAR SUNDAY EDITION JUST FOUR WEEKS BEFORE THE NATIONAL ELECTION. HOW DOES THAT MATCH UP TO THE ROMNEY STORY IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" FAMED HOME SECTION? KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS "THE NEW YORK TIMES" HAS A HOME SECTION? (LAUGHTER) BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT. WAS'S THE POINT AGAIN?
ITS PROPORTIONALITY. IT'S ALL ABOUT PROPORTIONALITY. IF IT WERE "THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER", AND THEY WERE DOING THIS TO BOTH  CANDIDATES I WOULDN'T SAY A WORD. I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, FAIR GAME.
Jon: FAIR GAME. IT'S ABOUT FAIR GAME. FAIR GAME IS A BIG ISSUE. THAT THE MEDIA SEEMS TO BE TALKING ABOUT, ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S FAIR GAME FOR  OTHER PEOPLE TO BE TALKING ABOUT THESE BIG ISSUES.
NOW THIS BATTLE OVER BAIN, WHAT IS FAIR GAME.
TAX ON MITT ROMNEY THE BUSINESSMAN AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS IN FACT FAIR GAME.
IS THAT FAIR GAME AND A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO USE ROMNEY'S  BUSINESS RECORD AGAINST HIM.
Jon: IS IT FAIR TO JUDGE JOB APPLICANT ITS ON PRIOR WORK EXPERIENCE? (LAUGHTER) IT SAYS HERE, IT SAYS HERE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: LET ME SEE. IT SAYS HERE YOU HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY AND ARE YOU NOT EVEN  A DOCTOR BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF FAIRNESS--  (LAUGHTER)
WELCOME ABOARD, NEW CHIEF OF SUJRY. NOW GO SCRUP UP! THEM HEART VALVES AIN'T GOING TO REPLACE THEMSELVES! AND THE MEDIA IS NOT JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE FAIRNESS OF THAT ISSUE. IT'S EVERY ISSUE.
THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO LAUNCH THE RAID TO KILL OSAMA BIN LADEN.
WAS THAT FAIR GAME.
RELIGION AND THE RACE FOR 2012, WHAT'S FAIR, WHAT'S OUT OF BOUNDS?
ARE YOU FAIR GAME IF YOU COME OUT AND CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT?
IS IT FAIR GAME TO ATTACK HIM WITH THE MOST VITRIOLIC TYPE OF NAMES.
THE ISSUE OF MOTHERHOOD, IS IT FAIR GAME.
Jon: SHOULD OUR FLAG HAVE 50 STARS WHEN SOME COUNTRY'S FLAGS ONLY HAVE TEN? (LAUGHTER) BUT WHILE THE FAIRNESS OF A VARIETY OF POLITICAL TACTICS WOULD SEEM TO JUST ALMOST  PURELY IN THE REALM OF THE SUBJECTIVE, THERE ARE TIME WORN METHS THE NEWS MEDIA  HAS TO ADJUDICATE THESE MATTERS. FOR INSTANCE IN YOUR ATTACK, WHAT IS THE MOTIVATION.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ATTACKING A ROM KNOW'S RECORD AS FAIR GAME  AND ATTACKING MITT ROMNEY'S RECORD IN TERMS OF POLITICAL GAIN.
THANK YOU. YOU MAY ATTACK HIM, THAT'S FAIR GAMEMENT BUT NOT IF IT'S FOR POLITICAL GAIN. YOU MAY ATTACK A POLITICIAN'S RECORD IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE YOURSELF  LOOK LIKE A BIG MAN AT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL REUNION. (LAUGHTER) FAIR GAME. YOU CAN ATTACK A POLITICIAN'S RECORD BECAUSE YOU ARE UNSURE IF THAT  POLITICIAN-- TEAR DUCTS ARE CLOGGED AND YOU WANT TO SEE HIM WEEP, FAIR GAME. BUT YOU MAY NOT ATTACK A POLITICIAN IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO JUST STOP HIM FROM BEATING YOU IN AN ELECTION. (LAUGHTER) NOT FAIR GAME. AND IF YOU ARE ATTACKING HIM AFTER GIVING HIM A HALF HOUR HEAD START IN A JUNGLE  COMPOUND, THAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME OF ALL. (LAUGHTER) I NEVER SHOULD HAVE READ HUNGER GAMES. OF COURSE--  (APPLAUSE) MOTIVATION IS NOT THE ONLY PARAMETER FOR ATTACK. POLITICAL FAIRNESS ALSO MANDATES THAT YOU CAN ONLY LOOK SO FAR BACK IN A CANDIDATE'S HISTORY.
WAS'S FAIR GAME. HIGH SCHOOL HAS ALWAYS BEEN THIS LINE, RIGHT, WHAT'S FAIR GAME HERE.
DO YOU THINK IT IS A QUESTION THAT IS WORTH ASKING? IN OTHER WORDS, SHOW THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE OR DO YOU THINK THAT'S OUT OF BOUNDS.
SAYING THAT MITT ROMNEY'S FAMILY COMES FROM A POLYGAMIST COME MUNE IN  MEXICO S THAT FAIR GAME? I MEAN IS THAT FAIR TO TALK ABOUT.
I MEAN, MITT ROMNEY'S GREAT, GREAT, GREAT-- I MEAN MANY GREAT GRANDPARENTS WERE  EVICTED FROM THEIR HOME FOR NUDITY AND GRAND THEFT APPLE, IS THAT FAIR GAME? (LAUGHTER) THERE'S GOT TO BE A MORE ATTRACTIVE PICTURE OF THE TWO OF THEM. IF ONLY THE NEWS NETWORKS HAD ACCESS TO EXPERTS WITH A SELFLESS INTEREST IF  DISCERNING THE FAIRNESS OF VARIOUS CAMPAIGN TACTICS.
IS IT FAIR GAME, I MEAN PUTTING-- PUTTING THE KILLING OF BIN LADEN IN A  POLITICAL AD AND TAKING THE ADDITIONAL STEP OF SUGGESTING MITT ROMNEY WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THE KILL ORDER?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THAT'S FAIR GAME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT DO WE DO NOW? I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THIS WHOLE MEDIA IS IT FAIR CONVERSATION IS A TIME-KILLING CIRCLE JERK. BUT THAT WOULD BE A DISSERVICE TO CIRCLE JERK, BECAUSE EVEN CIRCLE JERK END WITH SOME KIND OF TANGIBLE CONCLUSION. (LAUGHTER) OH, WHAT IF INSTEAD OF ASKING IF POLITICIANS ATTACKS ARE FAIR, MAYBE YOU  COULD FIND OUT IF THEY ARE TRUE OR ACCURATE OR RELEVANT, UNLESS YOU'VE GOT SOME SORT OF SCIENTIFIC EMPIRICAL WAY OF CALCULATING THE FAIRNESS  OF SOMETHING THAT I AM UNAWARE OF.
TEXT YOUR ANSWER TO 36288 TYPE SR 1 FOR FAIR GAME, SR 2 FOR DIRTY POLITICS.
Jon: TEXTING! NO BETTER WAY TO SOLVE POLITICS THAN WITH THE SAME METHOD WE USE TO DISTRIBUTE  PICTURES OF OUR GENITALS. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
