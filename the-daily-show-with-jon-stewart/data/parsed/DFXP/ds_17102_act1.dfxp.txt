MAY 9, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOT A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VISIT. OUR GUEST IS JOHN HALL. HE IS THE DEAN OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY AND I CANNOT WAIT TO FIND OUT WHETHER HE IS A HUFFLEPUFF  OR GRIFFIN DORR. (LAUGHTER) YESTERDAY ON THIS PROGRAM... FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WATCHED, I  DON'T WATCH THIS PROGRAM, REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE. WE E MAY HAVE INSINUATED PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS SOMEHOW BEING DISINGENUOUS IN GIVING IN  TO HIS MOST BASE POLITICAL CALCULATIONS BY NOT JUST SAYING HE FAVORS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND  EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL AMERICANS. THAT HIS POSITION IS EVOLVING IS WEAK TEA WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW AT  THE TIME IS THAT HE HAD PLANNED THIS: .
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO GO AHEAD AND AFFIRM THAT I THINK  SAME-SEX COUPLES SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MARRIED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS GAY. (LAUGHTER) FRIENDLY. GAY FRIENDLY. (LAUGHTER) DAMN YOU, ELLIPSIS. (LAUGHTER) AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHO DESERVES THE CREDIT FOR THIS.
I'LL TAKE A LOT OF CREDIT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO EXCITING POSITIVE NEWS FOR EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL CITIZENS, A SYMBOLIC VICTORY  THAT CAN IN NO WAY BE DAMPENED BY THE CODIFYING OF BIGOTRY IN-- LET'S SAY THE STATE WHERE THE  DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO BE HOLDING THEIR CONVENTION. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
NORTH CAROLINA VOTERS PASSED A STRICT AMENDMENT TO THEIR CONSTITUTION THAT BANS SAME-SEX MARRIAGES.
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS, NORTH CAROLINA, FOR A MOMENT I WAS FEELING A BRIEF GLIMPSE OF WHAT  I GUESS DOCTORS WOULD CALL HAPPINESS AND A FULL HEART AND I APPRECIATE YOU ENDING THAT. BY THE WAY, IN YOUR ZEAL TO PROTECT YOURSELVES FROM THE GAY MENACE THERE ISN'T ANY CHANCE  YOU MAY HAVE, I DON'T KNOW, CREATED SOME COLLATERAL DAMAGE PHO *PBS THE HETEROS.
IT ALSO BANS CIVIL UNIONS AND DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS-- AND GET  THIS, NOT JUST FOR GAY COUPLES BUT STRAIGHT COUPLES IN THE STATE, TOO.
OOPS! (LAUGHTER) WE (BLEEP)ED UP! YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH, ACTUALLY. THAT'S A STEP TOWARDS EQUALITY SINCE MANY OPPOSITE-SEX COUPLES WILL NOW ENJOY THE SAME LACK OF  RIGHTS SAME-SEX COUPLES HAVE ALWAYS NEVER HAD. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ONE OF THE MEASURES CHIEF BACKERS WAS NORTH CAROLINA "VOTE  FOR MARRIAGE" WHICH ARGUED "WHEN MARRIAGE CEASES TO HAVE ITS HISTORIC MEANING AND  UNDERSTANDING OVER TIME FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE WILL MARRY." YES, OF COURSE, IT WILL BE TOO  GAY NOW. (LAUGHTER) LIKE ROLLERBLADING. (LAUGHTER) BUT, YES, LET'S EXAMINE MARRIAGE'S HISTORIC MEANING. IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN MARRIAGE'S HISTORIC MEANING. WHAT IS MARRIAGE'S HISTORIC MEANING, BY THE WAY? LET ME SEE IF I CAN LOOK THAT UP HERE. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. LET ME SEE. MARRIAGE ORIGINATED AS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT THAT ALLOWED FAMILY PATRIARCHS TO FACILITATE THE  TRANSFER OF CHATTEL PROPERTY SUCH AS LIVESTOCK OR DAUGHTERS. (LAUGHTER) THROUGH LAWFUL CONTRACTS AND THEN AFTERWARDS HAVING A PARTY. OKAY. COULD ANYONE FIGHTING FOR THIS MARRIAGE BAN FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES DEFINE IN THE THE MOST  IGNORANT WAY POSSIBLE?
IF MARRIAGE IS RADICALLY REDEFINED AS BEING JUST A WAY OF AFFIRMING PRIVATE FEELINGS OF  LOVING ATTRACTION THEN EQUALITY WILL REQUIRE ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO LOVE DOGS TO MARRY DOGS AND  PEOPLE WHO LOVE ICE CREAM TO MARRY ICE CREAM.
Jon: YES, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. YOU KNOW, I REALIZE NOW THAT'S NOT A BALD HEAD, THAT'S A SOLAR  PANEL FOR A DUMB ASS MACHINE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, I JUST WANT TO ADD VERY QUICKLY... (BARKING)  DOES YOUR WIFE KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONSENSUAL LOVE THAT LEADS  TO MATRIMONY AND THE ENJOYMENT YOU GET FROM A DAIRY QUEEN BLIZZARD? (LAUGHTER) NOBODY WOULD MISTAKE THESE TWO THINGS. WELL, ONE GUY MIGHT MISTAKE THEM.
I LOVE FRUIT SALAD!
THEN WHY DON'T YOU MARRY IT?
ALL RIGHT, THEN. I WILL!
DO YOU, PEE-WEE HERMAN TAKE THIS FRUIT SALAD TO BE YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE?
Jon: IT'S CHAOS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT AGAIN IT'S THIS KIND OF RESULT IN NORTH CAROLINA THAT  SHOWS WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID TODAY WAS A BOLD MOVE, PUTTING PRINCIPLE OVER POLITICS OR TO  PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY...
JUST HOW UNPOPULAR IS PRESIDENT OBAMA IN SOME PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES?
Jon: OH, I KNOW THIS GAME! IT'S THAT NEW SHOW "YO CNN SNAPS." (LAUGHTER) OKAY, I WANT TO PLAY, LIKE, OH, MAN, THE PRESIDENT IS SO UNPOPULAR HE'S LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DEBATES SO SOMEONE WILL  TALK TO HIM. (LAUGHTER) OBAMA IS SO UNPOPULAR KENYA NOW SAYS HE WAS BORN IN GHANA. (LAUGHTER) HE'S SO UNPOPULAR HIS BEN & JERRY'S FLAVOR IS IM-PEACH. (AUDIENCE REACTS) BUT YOU DID ENJOY THE GHANA ONE. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, CNN, YOUR TURN. OBAMA IS SO UNPOPULAR...
LET'S LOOK AT WEST VIRGINIA. THE PRESIDENT LOST ROUGHLY 40% OF THE VOTE IN LAST NIGHT'S DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. HE WON OVERALL BUT LOST TO AN INMATE. THE GUY'S NAME IS KEITH JUDD SERVING TIME AT THE BEAUMONT FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTE  IN TEXAS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT IS (BLEEP)ED UP! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WOW! WOW! I GUESS WEST VIRGINIA IS ONE OF THEM PRIMARIES WHERE REPUBLICANS CAN VOTE IN THE DEMOCRATS'  PRIMARY JUST TOES ME WITH THEM AND THEN THEY... WOW! ONLY DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS? THAT IS (BLEEP)ED UP! (LAUGHTER) PLEASE TELL ME THAT THE GUY WHO GOT 40% OF THE VOTE IS WEARING A  COON SKIN CAP BECAUSE... (LAUGHTER). OR IS BEING ATTACKED BY A FERRET BECAUSE... (LAUGHTER). OH, BOY. ANYONE ELSE VOTE YESTERDAY?
IN INDIANA WE SAW THE LONGEST-SERVING REPUBLICAN IN THE SENATE LOSE HIS SEAT AFTER  36 YEARS. SENATOR DICK LUGAR IS OUT, LOSING TO A CANDIDATE BACKED BY THE TEA PARTY, INDIANA STATE TREASURER RICHARD MOURDOCK.
Jon: NO, NOT DICK LUGAR! NOT OUR MOST PORN-NAMED SENATOR! (LAUGHTER) OTHER THAN SENATOR JOHNNY GIANTBALLS. (LAUGHTER) AFTER ONLY 36 YEARS IN THE SENATE? HE WAS ONLY 12 YEARS AWAY FROM GETTING SOMETHING DONE. (LAUGHTER) WELL, CONGRESS HAS BEEN SOMETHAT THAT TPHAPBT. MAYBE THIS NEW GUY WILL GET THINGS DONE.
I HAVE A MIND-SET THAT SAYS BIPARTISANSHIP OUGHT TO CONSIST EMOCRATS COMING TO THED  REPUBLICAN POINT OF VIEW.
Jon: WOW, COMPLETELY REDEFINING THE MEANING OF WORDS. (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE GOING DO GREAT IN THE SENATE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
