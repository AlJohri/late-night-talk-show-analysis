2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL, WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stewart: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
GET READY FOR TONIGHT, OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS GOING TO COME OUT. TJ AS I CALL HIM. HE AND I WON'T THE SAME SCHOOL. BUT NOT AT THE SAME TIME. MANY OF YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THIS. TODAY IS A SPECIAL DAY. ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF OSAMA BIN LADEN, JUST 12 MONTHS AGO PARENTS ACROSS THE  COUNTRY SUDDENLY EXPLAINED TO THEIR CHILDREN WHY THEY JUST SHOUTED AT THE TV.
YEAH!  OH!, OH, YEAH!
BIN LADEN -- ONE YEAR LATER, THIS AD TOUTING OBAMA'S PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP DURING THE RACE WHILE SUBTLY  QUESTIONING HIS OPPONENT'S JUDGMENT. THAT AD IS --
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS NOT ABOVE POLITICAL SIZING ANY ISSUE  FOR PERSONAL GAIN, POLITICIZING WHAT -- AN EVENT THAT ALL AMERICANS AM LAWED ENORMOUSLY, IT IS DEPLORABLE TO POLITICIZE THIS.
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO SPIKE THE FOOTBALL AND ALL OF  THIS, WE SHOULDN'T GLOAT ABOUT IT.
RUNNING CAMPAIGN ADS GLOATING ABOUT IT.
WAAH!
WAAH!
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. REPUBLICANS, YOU ARE ANNOYED BY THE ARROGANCE AND BRAGGADOCIO OF A WARTIME PRESIDENT POLITICAL  HAT, YOU THINK HE IS DIVISIVELY AND UNFAIRLY BELITTLING HIS OPPONENT. I SEE. HAVE A QUESTION. ARE YOU ON CRACK?  WERE YOU ALIVE LO THESE PAST TEN YEARS?  IT SEEMS UNSEEMLY FOR THE  PRESIDENT TO SPIKE THE FOOTBALL. BUSH LANDED ON A (BLEEP) AIRCRAFT CARRIER WITH A FOOTBALL STUFFED PIECE, HE SPIKED THE  FOOTBALL BEFORE THE GAME HAD EVEN STARTED!
YET YOUR REPUBLICAN OUTRAGE --  [ APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: YOU ARE CALLING OUTRAGEOUS THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW SEGMENT, YOU ARE AWARE THAT  THE FRONTAL LOBE OF THE KOR TEXT ALLOWS US TO CELEBRATE THESE THINGS AS THEY OCCUR, RIGHT?
FORMER BUSH ADVISOR AND CURRENT ROM ROM ADVISOR ED GILLESPIE.
IT WAS A UNIFYING EVENT FOR ALL AMERICANS AND HE HAS MANAGED TO TURN IT INTO A DIVISIVE, PARTISAN, POLITICAL ATTACK.
Stewart: YEAH, THAT WOULD BE LIKE IN 2004 SAYING SOMETHING LIKE, IF KERRY HAD HIS POLICIES  IN PLACE TODAY IS A SADDAM HUSSEIN WOULD NOT ONLY BE IN BAGHDAD BUT HE WOULD BE IN CURATE.
, KUWAIT.
HE WOULD NOT ONLY BE IN BAGHDAD, BUT KUWAIT.
OH, MY GOSH.
BLURRY ED GILLESPIE IS DIVISIVE AND PARTISAN.
BY THE WAY, BLURRY GILLESPIE ALSO THE NAME OF A LESS THAN HERALDED TRUMPET PLAYER.
NOBODY EVER BOOKED BLURRY, JUST DIZZY.
THERE IS MORE.
THE ATTACK ROM ROM WOULDN'T HAVE DONE.
YOU SEE IN THE BUSH AD SAYING, YOU KNOW, HE IS A STRONG  LEADER, YOU DON'T SEE HIM SAYING AND THAT GUY, YOU KNOW, WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
YEAH, YEAH, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE USED HIM TO PROJECT HOW A HYPOTHETICAL PRESIDENT ROMNEY  WOULD ACT. AND IT IS SO DEVIOUS OF DEMOCRATS TO STEAL THAT TACTIC.
THE CEREBRAL CORTEX, BACK FAKE.
NOW WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE TERRORISTS ARE A.
HOW CAN ROMNEY PROTECT US WHEN HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE THREAT.
THIS IS PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
NO, NO, YOU DON'T APPROVE OF THE THAT MESSAGE. YOU THINK IT IS DIVISIVE AND PARTISAN. THE GUY JUST SAID THAT. BEFORE OUR OTHER TROUBLING ASPECTS TO THIS ANNIVERSARY.
ONE MIGHT EXPECT THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY GREAT DAY, GREAT JOB ON BEHALF OF THE NAVY SEALS.
I WOULD DO WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS SUPPOSED TO DO IS GIVE CREDIT  TO OTHERS AND THOSE ON THE FRONT LINE.
Stewart: YES, THANK YOU. THAT IS TROUBLE.  WHY CAN'T PRESIDENT OBAMA SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
GIVE THANKS FOR THE MEN WHO CARRIED OUT THIS OPERATION.
HANGS TO THE REMARKABLE COURAGE AND PRECISION OF OUR FORCES.
THANKS TO OUR INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS AND SPECIAL FORCES.
THE PILOTS WHO LANDED THE HELICOPTER.
THE TROOPS, THE STEELS, WE KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: HONESTLY, I THINK HE THANKED EVERYBODY BUT HARVEY WEINSTEIN.
UNBELIEVABLE. NOW, BY THE WAY, IN A CACOPHONY OF GALLING FORGETFULNESS, AKA BALD HEIMER, PA TALKIE STANDS ALONE.
THANK THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE.
HERE IS GEORGE PA TAU CAN I AND AT 2004 REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
ON SEPTEMBER 11TH, AL QAEDA ATTACKED AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME THEY MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. THERE IS ONE THING THEY DIDN'T BANK ON, THEY DIDN'T BANK ON GEORGE W. BUSH.  HE MOBILIZED OUR FORCES AND> WENT TO AFGHANISTAN.
GEORGE BUSH PROTECTED OUR COUNTRY AND HE PROTECTS IT STILL!
Stewart: BY HIMSELF!
BECAUSE GEORGE BUSH IS IRONMAN!
THAT IS A FACT!, NOW TO BE FAIR NOT EVERYBODY IS CRITICIZING OBAMA FOR THE AD, SOME ARE CRITICIZING ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE AD. THE OBAMA TEAM NOW IS TRYING TO MAGNIFY THE POLITICAL BENEFIT OF THE RAID WITH THAT CAMPAIGN AD  SUGGESTING MITT ROMNEY MAY NOT HAVE ORDERED IT N THE ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE OF A CAMPAIGN  SUCH DISTORTIONS MAY BE COMMONPLACE, BUT FOR THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF TO DO IT IN  THE PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN LEADER IN THE WHITE HOUSE RINGS ONE WORD TO MIND. YUCK.
Stewart: BY THE WAY IF YOU ENJOYED THAT YOU SHOULD CHECK  OUT BRIT HUME'S NEW SHOW, BRIT HUME ONE WORD REVIEWS. GOOD. REALLY?
SMURFTASTIC.
RRRRR.
I GET IT, YOU CAN'T (BLEEP) ON YOUR OPPONENT DURING AN OFFICIAL FUNCTION. LIKE GREET AGO HEAD OF STATE. I AM JUST CURIOUS DID YOUR CEREBRAL CORTEX NOT RECORD THIS BUSH ELECTION YEAR GEM WITH  IRAQI PRIME MINISTER ALLAWI.
TO THE WORLD IS BETTER OFF WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN SITTING IN A PRISON CELL.
THAT STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE STATEMENT MY OPPONENT MADE YESTERDAY. YUCK.
THERE IS PLENTY MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. LOOK, REPUBLICANS, YEAH, THE OBAMA AD, KIND OF (BLEEP), A LITTLE OF A CHEAP SHOT, BUT THE  ONLY REASON YOU ARE PISSED IS THAT YOU DIDN'T GET TO RUN IT. BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, IF BIN HAD BEEN KILLED ON BUSH'S WATCH  THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE AD YOU ARE RUNNING WITH.
HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF OUR DARKEST DAYS, ONE OF THE MOST EVIL MEN IN HISTORY.
Stewart: AND I GOT HIM!  THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S ME. GEORGE W OSAMA BIN LADEN KILLING BUSH.
NO, PLEASE, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU ARE GOING DOWN!  TEXAS STYLE!
DEATH IS A DISH BEST SERVED BARBECUE.
WHERE WAS KERRY?  SAILING TO PUSSY ISLAND.
YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WITH EPICOT BALLS. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS HIDING. REAGAN TOLD ME IN A DREAM.
ONE FOR THE GIPPER, GEORGE.
YOU ARE WELCOME, AMERICA. TAKE THAT BEARDY!  YEEEEEHAAAA!!!
I AM GEORGE W. BUSH AND I SURE AS HELL APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
Stewart: WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
