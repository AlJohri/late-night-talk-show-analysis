( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN SEEING SO MUCH OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE  WORLD-- SO MUCH OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD TODAY, RELIGIONS  JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET ALONG. BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY DO? THAT, TOO, IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. ( LAUGHTER ) JOHN OLIVER HAS MORE.
AS WE ALL KNOW, ISLAM IS GOING TO TAKE OVER AMERICA. WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IS SOMEWHAT SOME AMERICANS ARE ACTUALLY HELPING. A CHRISTIAN CHURCH AND A MUSLIM CHURCH COMING TOGETHER, ONE NATION, TWO FAITHS UNDER GOD, AND THE SAME ROOF. THERE'S AN EPIDEMIC OF CHURCHES OPENING THEIR DOORS TO MUSLIM COMMUNITIES, CHURCHES LIKE THE  OLD UNITED METHODIST CHURCH IN VIRGINIA.
WE WERE THRILLED WHEN HE GOT THE CALL ASKING IF THE MOSQUE COULD USE OUR CONGREGATION FOR  ITS PRAYERS ON FRIDAY.
WE WERE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO WORSHIP, AND THEY WERE VERY GENEROUS AND HE SAID WHY NOT? YOU CAN COME AND OFFER YOUR PRAYERS HERE.
WHAT IF THE MUSLIM GOD OVERHEARS THE PRAYERS FROM THE CHRISTIANS? IS THERE NOT A DANGER THOSE PRAYERS WILL JUST-- THEY'LL GET-- UHM...
I DON'T THINK GOD HAS ANY TROUBLE LISTENING TO THE PRAYERS.
BUT IT'S LIKE SANTA CLAUS-- HE CAN ONLY COME DOWN ONE CHIMNEY. AND HE NEEDS TO KNOW WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN GOOD OR WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN MUSLIM. ( LAUGHTER ) FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE A FEW PREACHERS, LIKE ALEX McFARLAND, WORKING TO PROTECT OUR CHURCHES.
THIS IS NOT THE CHURCH'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE WORSHIP SPACE FOR FALSE RELIGIONS. WE LOVE MUSLIMS, BUT THE BELIEF SYSTEM IS ISLAM, THE FAITH SYSTEM ISLAM IS FALSE.
YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MUSLIMS AT ALL, JUST MUSLIMS THAT PRACTICE ISLAM?
NO, WE LOVE MUSLIMS BUT IT'S NOT TRULY LOVING TO HELP A  PERSON BE, YOU KNOW, CONTINUALLY ENSLAVED IN A FALSE BELIEF SYSTEM.
SADLY, PEOPLE LIKE PASTOR PERRY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT CHRISTIANITY IS REALLY.
THE VERY CORE OF CHRISTIANITY IS ABOUT EMBODYING THE LIFE OF JESUS.
THEN WHY DO YOU GO AGAINST THE WORD OF JESUS BY PROMOTING A FALSE RELIGION?
NO, OFFENSE, BUT YOU GET IT, RIGHT? I AM BEING FAITHFUL TO JESUS BY WELCOMING THE STRANGER INTO THE COMMUNITY.
WE LOVE JESUS.
OH, COME ON!
JESUS IS MENTIONED MORE TIMES IN THE KORAN THAN PROPHET MOHAMMED.
YOU SEE, THIS INFILTRATION HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR CENTURIES. THAT CAN'T BE MERELY COINCIDENCE. IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE NEFARIOUS AT WORK.
SATAN TRIES TO HINDER THE SPREAD OF GOD'S TRUTH, AND I  DON'T THINK WE WOULD WANT THAT IN A CHRISTIAN SANCTUARY.
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU'D BE LETTING SATAN INTO THE BUILDING  IF MUSLIMS WERE WORSHIPPING THERE?
POTENTIALLY.
HOLY ( BLEEP )!
ABSOLUTELY. LISTEN, AND FOR THE PERSON WHO SAYS--
I MEAN THAT LITERALLY. THAT IS SOME HOLY ( BLEEP ). AND LEAVE IT TO SATAN TO INFILTRATE THE CHURCH'S MOST VULNERABLE SPACE IT'S  ALL-PURPOSE ROOM. AT GREAT PERSONAL RISK I SNUCK IN UNDER COVER TO DISCOVER THEIR TRUE INTENT. THEIR LEADER LED HIS FLOCK IN A DIABOLICAL CALL TO ARMS.
THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD WHO DO NOT EVEN GET CLEAN WATER TO DRINK.
AT LEAST I THINK IT WAS DIABOLICAL. HIS ACCENT WAS A LITTLE THICK. EITHER WAY, PASTOR PERRY HAD A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO.
WE ARE TWO DIFFERENT FAITHS BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS, TALKING  TOGETHER, WORKING TOGETHER FOR A COMMON PURPOSE.
BUT, OF COURSE, THE CHRISTIANS HAVE TO TAKE THE LEAD. IT WOULD NEVER GO THE OTHER WAY.
WHAT IF WE WENT TO THE-- THE LOCAL IMAM AND SAID, "MAY WE USE  YOUR MOSQUE ON SUNDAYS AS A PLACE TO WORSHIP?"
THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
NOW WOULD BE A REALLY BAD TIME FOR US TO CUT AWAY TO CHRISTIANS PRAYING IN A MOSQUE.
WELL, UHM--
IF THERE WAS THAT MAGIC CLIP OF AN IMAM INVITING CHRISTIANS TO WORSHIP IN A MOSQUE, THAT  WOULD BE A KICK TO THE NUTS.
HAVE YOU GOT THAT?
WE REGULARLY INVITE OUR CHRISTIANS FRIENDS TO WORSHIP HERE AT THE INDUSTRY.
THEY WORSHIP JESUS AT THIS NEW JERSEY MOSQUE. OH, ( BLEEP ). OH, ( BLEEP ). SOMEONE JUST MADE YOU LOOK LIKE A FOOL!
WOW. I'M SURE, I'M SURE-- YOU KNOW,-- THAT DOESN'T, UHM, NEGATE THE  FACT THAT WE FIGHT AN ENEMY.
BUT PERHAPS THE REAL FIGHT WON'T COME IN THIS LIFE. OBVIOUSLY, CHRISTIANITY IS THE ONE, TRUE FAITH, BUT IF ISLAM IS CORRECT, YOU ARE ( BLEEP ).
THAT'S TRUE. BUT, YOU KNOW--
I MEAN YOU ARE POWERFULLY ( BLEEP ). ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
