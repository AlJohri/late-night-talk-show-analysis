(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: OUR GUEST TONIGHT. THE NEW MOVIE IS CALLED UNKNOWN.
EXCUSE ME. DO I KNOW YOU?
WHAT'S WRONG? I'M SORRY. I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT. I WAS IN A COMA. I DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS.
YOU MUST HAVE ME CONFUSED WITH SOMEONE ELSE.
IT'S ME. MARTIN. YOUR HUSBAND.
THIS IS A MISUNDERSTANDING. I DON'T KNOW THIS MAN. THIS IS MY HUSBAND.
Jon: THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE. PLEASE WELCOME JANUARY JONES. WELCOME, WELCOME. (SCREAMING).
Jon: THAT WAS AS GUTORAL AS IT GETS. I'M PRETTY SURE THAT WAS FOR YOU. OR WAS IT? ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S HAPPENING? HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GREAT.
Jon: THE MOVIE IS A FINE... THERE'S A LOT OF INTRICACIES.
YES.
Jon: TO THE PLOT. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO.
AND I CAN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.
Jon: YOU CAN'T ANSWER.
NO.
Jon: WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOMETHING.
YES, LET'S.
Jon: IT IS A GOOD MOVIE. THIS LIAM NEESON.
I THINK HE'LL BE A BIG STAR.
Jon: HE'S A BIG HUNK OF A MAN. MASSIVE.
6'5", IRISH.
Jon: THE FAKE IRISH. I DON'T BLAME HIM. HE'S FROM NEW JERSEY.
THAT RUINS IT FOR ME.
Jon: IT DOES RUIN IT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. SOMETIMES THE TRUTH HAS TO BE TOLD. YOU ARE FROM ONE OF THE DAKOTAS. WHICH ONE?
DOES IT MATTER? NOBODY EVER CARES.
Jon: I ASSUME ZIP CODEWISE IT DOES.
IT'S ALL ONE ZIP CODE.
Jon: WE SHOULD REFER TO IT AS DAKOTA. ALL RIGHT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
STILL THE DAKOTA TERRITORY.
Jon: I DID NOT REALIZE THAT.
I'M FROM SOUTH JUST TO BE CLEAR. THERE IS A BIT OF A RIVALRY.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
YES.
Jon: IS IT A MASON-DIXON SITUATION? ARE WE... WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE? DOES ONE CALL A SUBMARINE SANDWICH A SUB AND THE OTHER A HOAGIE? WHAT LEVEL....
WE MAKE FUN OF EACH OTHER'S ACCENTS AND THE WAY WE DRIVE. SOUTH DAKOTA....
Jon: I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO THE DIFFERENCE IN DRIVING ABILITIES. SEEMS LIKE A VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY.
EVERYONE THINKS THEY'RE BETTER BECAUSE THEY GET MORE SNOW.
Jon: OKAY. AND WHAT WOULD SOUTH DAKOTA AT THAT POINT LORD OVER NORTH DAKOTA.
MOUNT RUSHMORE.
Jon: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THE BAD LANDS.
Jon: YOU HAVE EVERYTHING. YOU HAVE BAD LANDS. MOUNT RUSHMORE AND THEY HAVE SNOW.
YEAH. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF SNOW TOO. THEY JUST MAY GET MORE.
Jon: THAT IS BRAGGING RIGHTS. AND FORGIVE ME. ROGER MARIS IS SOUTH OR NORTH? DO YOU KNOW ROGER MARIS.
BASEBALL.
Jon: THE YANKEE GREAT. 51 HOME RUNS, NO STEROIDS.
THEY HAVE SOMEONE FAMOUS IN SOUTH DAKOTA?
Jon: SETTLE DOWN. I WOULD LIKE TO GO THERE.
TOM BROKAW WAS, IS.
Jon: HE LIVES IN SOUTH DAKOTA NOW.
NO, NO, NO.
Jon: YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO SOUTH DAKOTA. IT IS NOW... IT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY CLEAR TO ME.
YOU KNOW, IT'S... MAYBE A TALL TALE. IT'S LEGENDARY THAT SOMEONE HAS COME FROM THERE BESIDES....
Jon: BUNYAN. DO YOU STILL HAVE FAMILY.
ALL MY FAMILY.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
YEAH.
Jon: HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT....
I HOPE THEY'RE NOT MAD ABOUT THIS.
Jon: WHY WOULD THEY BE MAD ABOUT YOU (BEEP) ON WHERE THEY LIVE? WHY WOULD THAT BOTHER THEM IN ANY WAY.
I LOVE SOUTH DAKOTA. I JUST SAID WE'RE BETTER THAN AT LEAST NORTH DAKOTA.
Jon: I'VE HEARD GREAT THINGS ABOUT IT. AND BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.
IT IS.
Jon: WERE YOU AN OUTDOORS PERSON?
THE WHOLE STATE IS AROUND 600,000, 700,000 PEOPLE. SO THERE'S NOT... YOU DO MOST EVERYTHING OUTSIDE.
Jon: DID YOU HAVE A HOME?
WE DID. AND LAND.
Jon: (LAUGHING) I WOULD NOT FAREWELL. HOW WOULD I BE THERE? DO THEY HAVE JEWS? LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
WE DON'T.
Jon: COULD WE SET UP ALMOST LIKE A PRESERVE WHERE JEWS COULD ROAM FREELY.
WITH THE BUFFALO.
Jon: PEOPLE COULD COME AND GO OH, THEY'RE MUCH SOFTER THAN I THOUGHT.
YEAH. I BROUGHT A BOYFRIEND HOME ONCE WHO WAS JEWISH. IT WAS THE TALK OF THE TOWN. I'LL TELL YOU.
Jon: IN SUPER BOWL ALLEGIANCE WHERE DO THE DAKOTAS GO? MINNESOTA, GREEN BAY? WHAT WAS YOUR... IN THE SUPER BOWL WHAT WAS YOUR ALLEGIANCE?
STEELERS. I'M A STEELERS FAN. MY DAD WAS A STEELERS' FAN WHEN I WAS A KID.
Jon: PASS DOWN TO THE NEXT GENERATION.
IF YOU'RE FROM THE EAST OR WEST SIDE YOU CAN GO VIKINGS, BEARS, PACKERS OR YOU CAN GO BRONCOS....
Jon: WEST SIDE.
MAYBE KANSAS. YEAH, WEST SIDE.
Jon: AGAIN IS THIS ANOTHER FEUD LIKE WEST SIDE EAST SIDE BECAUSE I KNOW NORTH AND SOUTH  AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE LIKE... YOU HAVE THAT FEUD AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE... I GUESS, NORTH AND SOUTH DAKOTA.
THEY DUEL.
Jon: THEY WOULD DUEL OUT THERE. WHENEVER I'VE SEEN IMAGES IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY ROMANTIC VISTA. IT SEEMS BEAUTIFUL. OKAY. YOU ARE UNIMPRESSED.
YOU SAW DANCING WITH WOLVES, DIDN'T YOU.
Jon: I DID SEE DANCING WITH WOLVES. I THOUGHT LAKOTA, DAKOTA (BEEP) CLOSE ENOUGH. ARE YOU IN A MOVIE?
OH, RIGHT.
Jon: THE MOVIE IS CALLED UNKNOWN. IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE THEATERS ON FRIDAY. IT'S QUITE GOOD.
YES IT IS GOOD.
Jon: YOU'RE IN IT.
THAT'S THE ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU.
Jon: AND LIAM IS IN IT AND HE'S QUITE GOOD.
AND IRISH.
Jon: AND IT'S PREMIERING AT THE SOUTH DAKOTA MOVIE THEATER.
