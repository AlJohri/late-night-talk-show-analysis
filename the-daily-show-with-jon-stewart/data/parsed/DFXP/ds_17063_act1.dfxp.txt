FEBRUARY 23rd, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW  WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART, YOUR GUEST TONIGHT, PAUL RUDD. ACTOR PAUL RUDD. PAUL RUDD IS GOING TO BE ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT, I LIKE HAVING HIM AROUND, IT MAKES  ME FEEL BETTER TO SIT NEXT TO A GUEST WHO HAS ABSOLUTELY NO CHARM OR PERSONAL CHAR IS MA. SON OF A PITCH, LET'S BEGIN IN ARIZONA, THE SITE OF LAST NIGHT'S REPUBLICAN DEBATE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE TO THEth DEBATE OF THIS CAMPAIGN SEASON. ONE MORE AND THE DEBATE WILL BE ABLE TO DRINK LEGALLY. MOSTLY TO FORGET ABOUT THE TERRIBLE THINGS THEY'VE HEARD IN THESE DEBATES. THE NETWORK FOR LAST NIGHT'S CONTEST, CNN. AND THEY NEEDED TO BRING EVERYTHING IN THEIR GRAPHICS AND VOICE OVER TRUCK TO  INTRODUCE TO YOU CANDIDATES YOU HAVE ALREADY MET 19 TIMES PRIOR.
RICK SANTORUM, THE LATE CONTENDER. MITT ROMNEY, THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER. NEWT GINGRICH, THE DETERMINED CHALLENGER. RON PAUL, THE DELEGATE HUNTER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THESE FOUR MEN HAVE GOT JUST 48 HOURS TO BREAK INTO THE WORLD'S TOUGHEST PRISON. WOMEN'S PRISON? IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE OPENING STATEMENT MITT ROMNEY HAS A LOT OF FAMILY IN ARIZONA.
I WANT TO RESTORE AMERICA'S PROMISE AND I'M GOING TO DO THAT--  (APPLAUSE)
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.
AS GEORGE KOS STANZA WOULD SAY, WHEN THEY ARE PLAUDING STOP, RIGHT.
Jon: TWO THINGS, ONE, THAT'S THE APPLAUSE PART FOR THE NIGHT. I'M GOING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S PROMISE AND-- EVEN ROMNEY COULDN'T BELIEVE YOU  WERE CLAPPING FOR THAT PABLUM. AND TWO, ROMNEY, THAT'S NOT THE SEINFELD LINE, IT'S JERRY'S LINE. AND IT GOES LIKE THIS.
WHEN YOU HIT THAT HIGH NOTE, YOU IS SAY GOOD NIGHT AND WALK OFF. SO DON'T PRETEND LIKE YOU WATCH SEINFELD, BIG PHONEY. THE BIG QUESTION, HOW WOULD THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TREAT NEWLY CROWNED  FRONT-RUNNER RICK SANTORUM. THE ANSWER, LIKE THEY WAS HIS POPPA.
SENATOR, DURING YOUR TERM IN CONGRESS, THE YEARS YOU'VE BEEN THERE, GOVERNMENT HAS DOUBLED IN SIZE.
THE SENATOR VOTED FOR NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, NOW HE'S RUNNING ON THE EFFORT TO GET  RID OF IT.
HE VOTED FOR THE BRIDGE TO NOWHERE.
HE LITERALLY VOTED FOR ABORTION. BECAUSE PLANNED PARENTHOOD GETS THE MONEY.
IF YOU HAVE NOT SUPPORTED HIM F WE HAD SAID NO TO ARLEN SPECTER WE WOULD NOT  HAVE OBAMACARE.
YOU HAVE A NEW TELEVISION AD THAT LABELS HIM A FAKE. WHY?
BECAUSE HE'S A FAKE. (LAUGHTER)
I'M REAL, I'M REAL, I'M REAL.
CONGRATULATIONS.
Jon: I AM REAL, RON. AND IF YOU TOUCH ME, YOU'LL FEEL KIND OF A SALTY FILM ON MY ARM. WHICH I CRIED WHEN YOU SAID THOSE HURTY WORDS. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT IS THE REASON RICK SANTORUM WILL BE ONE MORE FAILED NOT ROMNEY. RATHER THAN MASK HIS CONSERVATIVE FAILINGS WITH DENIALS OR LIES OR NONSENSICAL TWADDLE, HE  ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS BEHIND HIS TRANSGRESSION.
I OPPOSED TITLE 10 FUNDING, I ALWAYS OPPOSED IT BUT IT INCLUDED IN A LARGER  A PROCEED BRACING BILL THAT INCLUDES A WHOLE LOST OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING THE  FUNDING FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.
I MADE IT VERY CLEAR, IN SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEWS THAT I-- I DON'T SUPPORT THAT. I HAVE NEVER SUPPORTED IT. WHY I SUPPORTED ARLEN SPECTER, NUMBER ONE, BECAUSE BECAUSE-- BECAUSE, BECAUSE ARLEN SPECTER DONE I  SUPPORTED NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, I SUPPORTED IT. IT WAS THE PRINCIPAL PRINCIPAL-- PRINCIPLES PRIORITY OF PRESIDENT BUSH. WHEN YOU ARE PART OF THE TEAM SOMETIME US TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM FOR THE LEADER  AND I MADE A MISTAKE. YOU KNOW, POLITICS IS A TEAM SPORT, FOLKS.
Jon: BOO, BOO, I BOO YOUR UNCOMFORTABLY FRANK ASSESSMENT OF THE INNER  WORKINGS OF OUR LEGISLATURE. BOO. SANTORUM, ARE YOU IN A DEBATE THIS IS NO PLACE FOR REASONED ARGUING. (LAUGHTER) SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE, BOYS.
WE HAVE TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL STAND UP FOR RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUS  AND I DID AND I WILL AGAIN AS PRESIDENT.
I BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS PRESIDENT ON NATIONAL SECURITY GROUNDS IN  AMERICAN HISTORY.
AND JUST AS ARIZONA IS FINDING OUT, YOU CAN STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. IT'S TIME WE FINALLY DID IT.
NOT ONCE DID ANYBODY IN THE ELITE MEDIA ASK WHY BARACK OBAMA VOTED IN FAVOR  OF LEGALIZING INFANTICIDE. SO LET'S BE CLEAR HERE.
Jon: I'M SORRY, I THINK YOU MAY HAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA CONFUSED WITH KING HEROD. IT IS A COMMON MISTAKE, UNDERSTANDABLE. FOR MONTH ITS NOW THESE REPUBLICANS CANDIDATES HAVE CHRIS CROSSED OUR GREAT NATION. MEETING HARDWORKING AMERICANS IN DINERS ON THE ROADSIDE AT TRUCK STOPS, ENGAGING IN 20 TELEVISED DEBATES, NEARLY TWO DAYS WORTH, SPIRITED GIVE-AND-TAKE ABOUT THE FATE  AND FUTURE OF THIS GREAT NATION WHICH WE LOVE. AND YET, IT IS NOT SETTLED. CAN WE SETTLE THIS, PLEASE, PERHAPS IN ONE MORE CHANCE. JOHN KING, THE HAIL MARY, IF YOU WILL.
WITHOUT CAVEATS OR EXPLANATIONS, PLEASE DEFINE YOURSELF USING ONE WORD AND ONE WORD ONLY.
Jon: OH, MAN, YOU SO GET US! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WE COULD HAVE JUST DONE THIS ONE WORD [BLEEP] AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WHOLE SHEBANG. SAVED OURSELVES A WHOLE LOT OF TIME AND MONEY.
CONGRESSMAN PAUL?
CONSISTENT.
Jon: I'LL GIVE HIM THAT. I GOT TO TELL YOU THOUGH THIS IS WHEN YOU REALLY MISS RECOGNIZE PERRY IN THE  DEBATES, DON'T YOU? HE IS THE GUY. HE'S THE GUY WHO COULD ACTUALLY BLOW IT IN ONE WORD. COULD YOU SHALL DID -- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WIN IT IN ONE WORD, THERE IS ONE WAY, BUT YOU COULD BLOW THIS MOTHER [BLEEP] IN ONE WORD, COULDN'T YOU. RICK PERRY DESCRIBE YOURSELF IN ONE WORD, TITTIES, NO! WHY DID I SAY THAT! OH! WHY DID I SAY TITTIES! THAT WAS WRONG! OH MAN! I WAS GOING TO SAY NIGGERHEAD-- OH, THAT'S TWO WORDS, OH, WHY DID I SAY! OH, MAN. I SHOULD HAVE SAID PANCAKES, PANCAKES, OH, THAT'S-- OH-- I HAVE HAD A BALL OUT HERE. OF COURSE THE SINGLE WORD CHALLENGE WOULD PROVE TOUGHER SLEDDING FOR WILLARD  MITT ROMNEY, A CANDIDATE FIGHTING THE PERCEPTION THAT HE GOES WHERE THE WIND  BLOWER, WILL DO ANYTHING TO WIN. I'M GUESSING ROMNEY PULLED THEE VIDZERS, COMMISSIONED A FOCUS GROUP, DESIGNED TO  EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE COUNTER THE NOTION THAT HE IS A FLIP-FLOPPING FLIP --
RESOLUTE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW THERE IS ANOTHER KOS STANZA PHRASE THAT APPLIES HERE.
IT'S NOT A LIE IF YOU BELIEVE IT. (LAUGHTER) AND THEN THERE WAS NEWT GINGRICH WHO THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT ARTICULATED A  WORLDVIEW THAT MADE HIM SOUND LIKE HE HAD GROWN-UP DURING SOME COMBINATION THE  GREAT DEPRESSION, SEVERAL WORLD WARS AND HAD THE BUBONIC PLAGUE.
YOU LIVE IN A WORLD OF TOTAL WAR FARE. WE HAVE TO GENUINELY WORRY ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS GOING OFF IN OUR OWN CITIES. VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD COULD BE IN DANGER AT VIRTUALLY ANY MINUTE. WE ARE NOW LOOK AT AN ABYSS ALL OF US ARE MORE AT RISK TODAY, MEN AND WOMEN, BOYS  AND GIRLS, THAN AT ANY TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT. AFTER ALL THAT MI ALMOST AFRAID TO HERE GINGRICH'S ONE WORD FOR HIMSELF.
MR. SPEAKER.
CHEERFUL. (LAUGHTER)
