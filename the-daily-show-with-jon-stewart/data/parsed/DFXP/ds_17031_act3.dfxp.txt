Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A GREAT ACTOR. HIS LATEST FILM THE HE BOTH DIRECTED AND STARRED IN IS CALLED "CORIOLANUS."
I SAY AGAIN IN SOOTHING THEM, WE NOURISH IN OUR SENATE REBELLION, INCENSE, SEDITION WHICH WE OURSELVES HAVE  SCATTERED BY MINGLING THEM WITH US, THE HONORED NUMBER WHO LACK NOT VIRTUE, NO, MORE POWER WHICH  WE HAVE GIVEN TO BEGGARS.
WELL...
NO MORE WORDS.
YOU SPEAK OF THE PEOPLE AS A GOD TO PUNISH, NOT MAN OF MERE INFIRMITY.
IT IS A MIND IN POISON WHERE IT IS NOT POISON ANY FURTHER.
SHALL REMAIN. HEAR YOU THIS MINNOW MARKS YOU.
Jon: WE SHOULD TOTALLY STILL TALK LIKE THAT. PLEASE WELCOME RALPH FIENNES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU. SO NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE.
YOUR FIRST DIRECTORIAL... YOUR DIRECTORIAL DEBUT, YOU TACKLE "CORIOLANUS," ONE OF THE  MOST DARK, TRAGIC SHAKESPEAREAN PLAYS. YOUR DECISION TO JUMP IN THAT DEEP A POND, HOW DO YOU COME TO THAT?
I PLAYED THE PART ON STAGE ABOUT 11 YEARS AGO, AND IT BECAME AN OBSESSION. IT'S A POLITICAL PARABLE, IF YOU LIKE. IT'S A TRAGEDY ABOUT... YOU SEE THE CRAZY SOLDIER WHO HAS NO TIME FOR POLITICIANS THAT CHANGE  THEIR MINDS. AND HE LOSES IT. AND IT'S... I THINK IT'S A STORY THAT HAS A LOT OF RESONANCE WITH THINGS GOING ON TODAY.
SURE.
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, PEOPLE ON THE STREETS, PEOPLE AT WAR AND POLITICIANS MANEUVERING AND  CHANGING THEIR MINDS AND IT JUST SPOKE TO ME. AT THE CENTER OF IT YOU HAVE THIS MOTHER/SON RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS THE THING THAT'S ALWAYS  MOVED ME ABOUT THE STORY.
AND IT'S SHAKESPEARE, SO THERE HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT IN  THERE ABOUT THE MOTHER AND THE SON. YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES. GUY HAD SOMISH SEUSS. LET'S FACE FACTS. IS IT... WHEN YOU... IT SEEMS TO FLOW SO EFFORTLESSLY FROM YOU. DID IT... HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO PUT YOURSELF IN THOSE PLACES? IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LANGUAGE THAT YOU FEEL... THE WAY THAT HE WRITES THAT SOMEHOW  YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT IN MANNER THAT SEEMS EFFORTLESS, YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE A CRAFT TO IT.
WELL, I'VE HAD A CRACK AT A FEW SHAKESPEARE PARTS OVER THE  YEARS, AND YOU GET BETTER AT IT, BUT I'VE ALWAYS... IT'S ALWAYS THRILLED ME EVER SINCE I WAS  YOUNG AND I HEARD RECORDINGS OF ACTORS DOING SHAKESPEARE, SOMETHING ABOUT THE LANGUAGE HAD A KIND OF MAGIC FOR ME. BUT YOU NEED TO DO IT, AND I'VE HAD GREAT OPPORTUNITIES DOING IT  ON STAGE AND I GUESS IT'S BEEN A DREAM OR AN OBSESSION OF MINE TO  TAKE THIS "CORIOLANUS" INTO A FILM.
Jon: ARE THE ACTORS IN BRITAIN... LIKE IN THE STATES, OUR ROLE MODELS ARE OBVIOUSLY STALLONE, SCHWARZENEGGER. [LAUGHTER] THE LANGUAGE IS LESS IMPORTANT NECESSARILY THAN WHAT WE WOULD CALL IN THIS COUNTRY "THE BULK. ," "THE HEFT." SO OUR ACTORS ARE TRAINED OBVIOUSLY BY POWER LIFTING. BUT IS THAT... WHEN YOU GO THROUGH... [LAUGHTER] YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH OUR WORK. WE'RE THE ONES WHO PLAY THE ARMY. WE'RE IN THE ARMY WITH YOUR CHARACTER, BUT IS THAT SORT OF THE FIRST THING THAT EVERY  SCHOOL BOY LIKE IN BRITAIN TACKLES?
NO. NO, I MEAN, I THINK FOR... FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE SHAKESPEARE IN SCHOOL IS REALLY A CHORE.
RIGHT.
AND IT'S HARD. BUT I THINK WHEN IT WORKS AND WHEN I'VE SEEN GREAT ACTORS DO IT AND INHABIT IT, IT CAN BE FANTASTIC. THERE'S ALWAYS A LITTLE LEARNING CURVE, IF YOU LIKE. THE FIRST ONE, I GO TO THE THEATER AND I SEE A SHAKESPEARE PLAY, I ALWAYS HAVE A MOMENT OF IJUDGMENT.
Jon: RIGHT.
ABOUT TEN, 15 MINUTES, THEN MY EAR CLICKS IN. I'VE SEEN SOME WONDERFUL ACTORS. VANESSA REDGRAVE IS IN THIS PLAYING MY MOTHER. SHE'S JUST EXTRAORDINARY AND HER EASE WITH THE LANGUAGE... YOU'RE RIGHT IN THERE WITH IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT SOMETIMES THE LANGUAGE IS A CHALLENGE, BUT I HAVE HEARD  ACTORS DO IT AND INHABIT IT IN A WAY THAT I THINK IT... THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS TAKE ON THE  ANOTHER LEVEL.
Jon: IT ELEVATES IT. IT'S LYRICAL, MUSICAL IN A WAY.
AND IT'S VERY REWARDING WHEN... I DID THE SHAKESPEARE PLAY JUST NOW IN LONDON IN THE  WEST END, "THE TEMPEST. " AND PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AFTER AND SAY, I'VE NEVER SEEN SHAKESPEARE BEFORE AND I LOVED  IT AND I WANT TO SEE MORE.
Jon: THAT'S AMAZING. YOU SHOULD HAVE SECURITY. YOU SHOULD BE, MR. FIENNES, SOMEWHERE IS HEREED AT THE DOOR. IN A SCHOOL BOYS' PLAY, THE KIDS IN OUR SCHOOL, THEY'RE ALWAYS  PUTTING ON "HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING"  OR "THE PAJAMA GAME." WHAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF THAT  WHEN YOU'RE EIGHT AND THEY WANT TO PUT YOU IN YOUR FIRST PLAY? WHAT'S THE GO TO? IS IT LIKE MARY POPPINS? WHERE DO THEY GO?
THE STAPLE USED TO BE "JOSEPH AND HIS TECHNICOLOR DREAM COAT."
Jon: BOY.
THAT WAS ALWAYS THE ONE THEY WENT. TO I DO THINK THAT SHAKESPEARE TAUGHT THAT STUDENTS... THE WAY TO LEAD STUDENTS IN IS MAYBE... I'M SURE ROMEO AND JULIET IS THE BEST ENTRY. IT'S THE STARRED. IT'S YOUNG LOVES. IT'S GANG, IT'S FIGHTING, IT'S STREET CRED AND MA CHIZ MOW.
Jon: EVERYTHING WE LOVE. ALL RIGHT. THIS ONE IS COMING OUT OF NOWHERE, BUT SOMEBODIED IN AUDIENCE ASKED ME BEFOREHAND, SO  I HAVE TO ASK. IF VOLDEMORT, AND THIS IS FROM THEM, SO I HAVE TO ASK YOU. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, THE ANSWER TO THIS I BELIEVE IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE, BUT YOU CAN DECIDE FOR YOURSELF. IF VOLDEMORT WAS IN A SWORD FIGHT, ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH HERMAN CAIN RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT, A GENTLEMAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND HAD TO STOP BECAUSE OF A LOT OF LADY PROBLEMS.
HISTORY.
Jon: IF THEY WERE IN A SWORD FIGHT, IN YOUR MIND, WHO WOULD BE THE VICTOR...
BETWEEN VOLDEMORT AND HERMAN CAIN?
Jon: EXACTLY.
DEPENDS ON THE LENGTH OF THE WAND. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: "CORIOLANUS," IT'S PRETTY GREAT, AND HE'S PRETTY  UNBELIEVABLE IN IT. IT WILL BE IN THEATERS ON JANUARY 20th. RALPH FIENNES.
