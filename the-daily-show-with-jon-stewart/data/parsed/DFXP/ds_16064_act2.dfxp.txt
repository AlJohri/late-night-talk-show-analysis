( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SGLO YOU KNOW, ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS-- ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS NOT  JUST FOR MAJOR CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE RECEIVED HUGE GOVERNMENT BAILOUTS. ANYONE CAN DO IT. YOU JUST HAVE TO THINK CREATIVELY. AASIF MANDVI HAS THE STORY.
Reporter: JUST OUTSIDE OF THE MONTREAL IN THE FRENCH CANADIAN  COUNTRYSIDE, A BLUE COLAR TOWN IS SUFFERING. THE LOCAL BUSINESSMAN BERNARD COLUMN, HAS A PLAN.
WHEN IT IS FINALIZED AND COMPLETED WE WILL PRODUCE 200,000 POUNDS A YEAR.
ALSO KNOWN AS CRUC FILE FIBER IS AN EXTREMELY DURABLE AND FIRE-RESISTANT FIBER USED IN  CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL.
AND IT IS SAFE.
IT IS, SAFE, YES, RELATIVELY.
YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THIS RELATIVELY SAFE MINERAL BY ITS OTHER NAME, WHICH ALSO HAPPENS  TO BE THE NAME OF THE TOWN.
ASBESTOS MEAN SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN FRENCH THAN IT DOES IN ENGLISH? BECAUSE IN ENGLISH IT MEANS SLOW HACKING DEATH.
OH, YES.
UNLIKE SMALL TOX, MINNESOTA, STRICT NINE ILLINOIS, AND CHOLERA, NEW JERSEY, ASBESTOS QUEBEC IS STANDING BY ITS NAME. TOWN DIRECTOR GEORGE GAGNE.
ASBESTOS HAS BEEN BANNED IN THE-- IN THE-- IN SOME PART OF THE WORLD, BUT FOR HERE, IN  QUEBEC, WE'RE SELLING THAT YOU SHOULD USE MORE ASBESTOS.
REALLY?
YES.
BUT SOME INSIST ON UNDERMINING THIS ECONOMIC RECOVERY.
ALL FORMS OF ASBESTOS, INCLUDING CRYSOTILE CAUSE CANCER AND HARMFUL LUNG EFFECTS. UNQUESTIONABLE, THE MINE SHOULD SHUT DOWN.
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION-- IS THERE ANY REASON WHY THE ASBESTOS INDUSTRY SHOULD NOT  TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY?
THERE'S NO GOOD SCIENTIFIC REASON.
BUT THERE STL A REASON WHY THEY SHOULD NOT TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY.
WE CAN'T THINK OF REASON WHY THEY SHOULD NOT TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY.
IF I WAS THEM, I WOULD TAKE ME VERY SERIOUSLY. ( LAUGHTER )
BINGO. CAN AM, DUDE, YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
THE TOWN HAS MARSHALED ITS OWN EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE.
WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT YOUR FORM OF ASBESTOS IS SAFE?
YOU DROVE IN THE CITIES AND YOU SAW THAT.
BECAUSE SICK PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS OUT WALKING IN THE STREETS.
THIS IS A CAT SCAN OF SOMEBODY'S LUNG. THE LUNG ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS HEALTHY. THIS BIG WHITE THING ON THE LEFT SIDE IS A LUNG CANCER ARE THE KIND THAT SOMEONE WITH ASBESTOS GETS.
FINE, I WALKED AROUND THE TOWN, AND I DIDN'T SEE ANY SICK PEOPLE. WHAT IS MORE SCIENTIFIC THAN THAT?
WELL, I WOULD SAY THIS IS MORE SCIENTIFIC THAN THAT.
DESPITE ALL THE ANTI-ASBESTOS PROPAGANDA, AND THE FACT THAT EVERYONE IN TOWN IS FOR SOME  REASON ONLY 18 INCHES TALL, THE PEOPLE OF ASBESTOS REFUSE TO BACK DOWN.
THE WAY WE FIGHT BACK IS BY INFORMING ALL THE GOVERNMENTS, AND TRYING TO USE THE SOCIAL NETWORKS, FACEBOOK, TWITTER, AND ALL THE OTHERS.
HOW MANY FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK DOES ASBESTOS HAVE?
I DON'T KNOW.
OF COURSE, USING THE POWER OF SOCIAL NETWORKS IS MORE CHALLENGING WHEN YOU'RE KILLING  YOUR FOLLOWERS. FORTUNATELY, THERE IS ONE MORE THING THAT MIGHT SAVE THIS TOWN.
INDIA IS BUYING 400,000 TONS A YEAR.
SO YOU'RE SELLING IT TO INDIA. THAT'S BECAUSE INDIA IS ONE OF THE FEW COUNTRIES SO OPEN MINDED  THEY HAVEN'T BANNED THE MATERIAL THAT CAUSES AN ESTIMATED 100,000 LUNG CANCER DEATHAISE YEAR. YOU THINK IN INDIA, PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING THE REGULATIONS?
YES, THEY USE IT SAFELY IN INDIA.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO INDIA?
I'VE BEEN MANY TIMES.
THIS CBC DOCUMENTARY TITLED "ASBESTOS, CANADA'S UGLY SECRET  CLEARLY SHOWS INDIA WORKERS TAKING EVERY PRECAUTION. THAT IS A REAL BANDANNA.
AS A CANADIAN I'M EMBARRASSED THAT WE'RE SENDING THIS PRODUCT  THAT WE'RE-- WE'VE ALL LEARNED NOT TO USE HERE BECAUSE IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
BUT AS A CANADIAN, DON'T YOU HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT, REALLY?
NO.
STILL COMMUM INSISTS INDIANS HAVE A SPECIAL PREDISPOSITION TO WORK WITH THE MATERIAL.
THEY'RE USED TO POLLUTION.
YEAH, THEY'RE USED TO POLLUTION, RIGHT. SO THEY CAN HANDLE IT.
THEY HAVE NATURAL ANTI-BODIES.
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. THAT'S REALLY ( BLEEP ) STUFF, MAN, SELLING THEM THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO KILL THEM. THAT'S MY FAMILY OVER THERE. I MEAN WHAT, IS THE FRENCH WORD FOR DOUCHE BAG? ANYBODY.  WHAT IS THE FRENCH WORD FOR
