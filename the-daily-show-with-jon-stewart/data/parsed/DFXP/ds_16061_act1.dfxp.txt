MAY 9, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WHAT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ACTRESS KAREN KNIGHTLY WILL BE JOINING US TONIGHT. BUT FIRST LET'S MOVE ON TO WHAT THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS ARE IN THE DEATH OF OSAMA BIN BIDEN. WHAT? IS THERE ANY ONE OF OUR LEADERS NAMES THAT CAN NOT BE CONFUSED WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN? ANYWAY, I'VE SHOOTING BIN LADEN IN THE HEAD AND THROWING HIM IN THE OCEAN... DO YOU  WANT ME TO SOFT SELL THIS TO YOU? NO. THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE LAST BIT UNFINISHED BUSINESS TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS (BEEP). AS IT TURNS OUT BIN LADEN WAS A RARE COMBINATION. NOT ONLY WAS HE EVIL, HE WAS LAME.
A NEW PICTURE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN IS EMERGING TONIGHT.
A HAGGARD OSAMA BIN LADEN WATCHING HIMSELF ON TV.
SITTING ON THE FLOOR COVERING BY A BLANKET, REMOTE CONTROL IN HAND.
Jon: JUST SITTING THERE ALL ALONE, GRAY, ROCKING BACK AND FORTH. WATCHING TV. WRAPPED IN A BLANKET. CAUSE HE'S COLD BUT TOO DAMNED CHEAP TO TURN THE HEAT ON. THIS GUY, THIS GUY, THIS GUY... WAIT A MINUTE. CAN I SEE THAT SHOT OF ME WATCHING THIS FOOTAGE OVER THE WEEKEND? SON OF A BITCH. NO! NO. ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, OSAMA, WE WEREN'T SO DIFFERENT, YOU AND I. EXCEPT OF COURSE FOR YOU BEING THE WORLD'S MOST EVIL MAN AND MY UNREKITED LOVE FOR THE BUGLES. BUT HOME VIDEO OF BIN LADEN IN HIS JIHAD SNUGGIE WASN'T THE MOST EMBARRASSING THING WE FOUND.
AND THEY FOUND A SYRUP WHICH ACCORDING TO FOLKLORE IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD AT  LEAST CAN BE USED FOR VIRILITY ENHANCEMENT.
Jon: YES, YES. WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT, YOU AND I. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  BIG DEAL. SO AN OLD GUY WITH SIX WIVES NEEDED TO USE A LITTLE DONG SYRUP. WHAT ELSE DID WE FIND?
LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE. THE CANDID SHOTS, THE GRAY BEARD. THE PROPAGANDA TAPE. THE BEARD HAS BEEN DYED BLACK.
Jon: HE DYES HIS BEARD? YOU KNOW, NOW I FEEL BAD FOR THE COURIER WHO HAD TO DO OSAMA'S SHOPPING AT THE ABBOTTABAD CVS. "I NEED YOU TO GO TO THE STORE AND GET ME SOME, WHAT YOU CALL, JUICE AND THREE BOXES OF THE JUST FOR MAD MEN. I WANT TO LOOK MY BEST WHILE DOING MY WORK."  (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  "I AM BIN LADEN! ." OF COURSE IN ALL THE HUBBUB OVER THE KILLING OF BIN LADEN WE CAN'T SELECT THE RACE TO  SELECT THE NEXT AMERICAN. THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S INDECISION 2012. GOOD LUCK, MY (BEEP) EDITION. LAST WEEK FOX HOSTED THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. AND THE OPEN STRUCK JUST THE RIGHT TONE.
THE DEFINING ISSUES FACING OUR NATION. FROM TAKING DOWN THE MOST WANTED MAN IN THE WORLD TO OUR EXPLODING DEBT.
IS IT IMMORAL TO ROB OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN'S FUTURES.
JOBS. AND SPIKING GAS PRICES. NOW THE CANDIDATES ON WHAT THEY WOULD DO IF THEY WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
Jon: AND NOW PLEASE WELCOME THE CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT OF THE POST APOCALYPTIC HELL SCAPE. THE FIRST QUESTION, HOW WOULD YOU AS PRESIDENT WHEN OUR DESPERATE CITIZENS BEGIN  EATING HUMAN FLESH, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? FOX, WE REPORT. YOU RUN AND HIDE. THIS SHOWDOWN HAS THE MOST NOTABLE FOR WHO WASN'T THERE. NAMES LIKE MITT ROMNEY SARAH PALIN, NEWT GINGRICH, MICHELLE BACHMANN, MITCH DANIELS, DONALD TRUMP. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE GOING TO THROW THE REST OF THE NAMES UP ON THE WEBB. AS A RESULT, AMERICA GOT TO MEET SOME OF THE LESSER KNOWN REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES.
CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL OF TEXAS, HERMAN CANE, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF GOD  MATTER'S PIZZA. TIM PAWLENTY OF MINNESOTA. RICK SANTORUM.
Jon: YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GOOGLE SOME OF THOSE CANDIDATES. ALTHOUGH I GUESS FOR THE LAST GUY I PREFER YOU DIDN'T DO THAT. BY THE WAY, IF YOU DIDN'T GET THAT JOKE, GO GOOGLE SAMTORUM RIGHT NOW. I'LL WAIT. YEAH. (BEEP) BELIEVE THAT? SANTORUM MIGHT AS WELL CHANGE HIS LAST NAME TO LEMON PARTY. GO AHEAD. GOOGLE THAT. I'LL WAIT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S MOVE ON. PERHAPS THE MOST WELL KNOWN CANDIDATE WAS 12th TERM TEXAS CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL THE ONLY  PARTICIPANT CURRENTLY HOLDING OFFICE.
WE DO NOT NEED SECRET PRISONS NOR DO WE NEED THE TORTURE THAT GOES ON IN THE  SECRET MILITARY PRISONS. MAYBE WE CAN TAKE CARE OF SOME PEOPLE BACK HERE AT HOME IF WE WEREN'T SPENDING $1.5 TRILLION  A YEAR ON OUR MILL TARISM.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THIS IS A WEAK REPUBLICAN FIELD. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS COMPROMISE YOUR LIBERTARIAN PRINCIPLES A LITTLE BIT, FEED  THESE PEOPLE CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE RED MEAT LIKE THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN  THE WORLD ARE REAGAN, JESUS AND REAGAN AGAIN. GAYS CAN GET MARRIAGE LICENSES WHEN THEY PRY THEM FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS. (BEEP) COME ON. GIVE IT TO THEM.
CONGRESSMAN PAUL, YOU SAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD STAY OUT OF PEOPLE'S PERSONAL HABITS. MARIJUANA, COCAINE, EVEN HEROIN SHOULD BE LEGAL IF STATES WANT TO PERMIT IT. YOU FEEL THE SAME ABOUT PROSTITUTION AND GAY MARRIAGE.
Jon: HERE'S YOUR CHANCE. WWW-JMD, WHAT WOULD JOHN McCAIN DO. THE NOMINATION CAN BE YOURS. JUST TAKE THE PRINCIPLES THAT MAKE YOU RESPECTED AND DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM THEM.
WHAT YOU'RE INFERING IS YOU KNOW WHAT? IF WE LEGALIZE HEROIN TOMORROW EVERYBODY WILL USE IT. HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE WOULD USE IT IF IT WAS LEGAL? I BET NOBODY WOULD. OH, YEAH, I NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CARE OF ME. I DON'T WANT TO USE HAIR WIN SO I NEED THESE LAWS.
Jon: NO! THE CORRECT ANSWER IS PRAYER IN SCHOOLS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU KEEP THIS UP AND YOU'LL NEVER END UP A SHELL OF YOUR FORMER SELF. HELLO, OLD FRIEND. I KNOW YOU'LL BE WATCHING TONIGHT. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH, YOU'RE A REAL MAVERICK. WILL NO TRAGICALLY AMBITIOUS POLITICIAN SPEED WALK AWAY FROM THE MILDLY CENTRIST  POSITIONS THEY ONCE HELD PERHAPS SOMEONE FOR WHOM THIS CRAVEN REVERSAL PRINCIPLE NET  A SHORT-LIVED APPEARANCE AT BEST?
YES, YOU.
TWO YEARS AGO YOU WOULD NOT ENDORSE WATER BOARDING OF HIGH- VALUE DETAINEES.
I SUPPORT ENHANCED INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES.
YOU DON'T OPPOSE GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR RESEARCH ON EXISTING STEM CELL LINES  ALREADY DERIVED FROM EMBRYOS.
AS TO EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD PURSUE THAT? ?
IN 2008 YOU SAID I SUPPORT A REASONAL CAP-AND-TRADE SYSTEM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.
I'VE MADE A MISTAKE AND I'VE OPPOSED THAT CAP-AND-TRADE MISS MISTAKE SINCE.
Jon: WELL PLAYED McCAIN Jr. LET'S SEE IF YOUR DIVE INTO ABYSS HAVE PAID DIVIDENDS.
HOW MANY OF YOU THINK HE WON THE DEBATE? WELL, WE CAN STOP RIGHT THERE.
Jon: WHAT? HERMAN KAINE, THE PIZZA GUY? THE PIZZA GUY WHOSE PIZZA CHAIN IS NAMED AFTER THE HEAD OF THE MAFIA, THAT GUY? EITHER HE'S AN EFFORTLESS TALKING POINT MACHINE OR THE DELICIOUSNESS OF HIS PIZZA HAS  CLOUDED VOTERS' MINDS.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW TODAY IS TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION. WE NEED TO GET GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IT IS THE WORST IN CURRENT HISTORY. I STRONGLY SUPPORT TOTAL REPLACING THE CURRENT CODE WITH THE FAIR TAX. GOVERNMENT DOESN'T CREATE JOBS. BUSINESSES CREATE JOBS.
Jon: YEAH, I KNEW IT WASN'T THE PIZZA. THERE YOU HAVE IT. REPUBLICANS HAVE SURVEYED THE FIELD AND BELIEVE THEIR BEST CHANCE TO WIN IS A CHARISMATIC  BLACK GUY WITH A FUNNY NAME. I MEAN, HERMAN. YEAH, AMERICANS WILL VOTE FOR A BLACK GUY NAMED HERMAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
