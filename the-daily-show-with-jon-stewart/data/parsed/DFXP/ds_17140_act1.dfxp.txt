Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, OH, THIS IS A TREAT. OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST MISTY MAY-TREANOR HERE TO TALK ABOUT HER RECENT TABLOID BREAKUP WITH  LET'S SAY SOMEONE FROM "THE HUNGER GAMES." ANYWAY, THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL  OF INTEREST ONLINE WITH ROBERT PATTINSON BECAUSE OF THAT WHOLE THING AND KRISTEN STEWART. OUR RATINGS IN THE KEY DEMOGRAPHIC THAT ADVERTISERS USE TO SELECT THEIR KILL LIST... (LAUGHTER). I'M SORRY "PREFERRED CUSTOMERS." WAS TO USE THEIR TERMINOLOGY BOFFA. IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT I HAD AFTER SEEING THE RATINGS FOR THE PAST ALMOST 15 YEARS BEEN  FOCUSED ON DOING A PROGRAM ABOUT SUBJECTS THAT ARE... LET ME JUST SHOW YOU THE TWEETS FROM THE FIRST... (LAUGHTER). FROM THE FIRST 15 MINUTES OF LAST NIGHT'S SHOW. SON OF A BITCH. (LAUGHTER) TOTES LAME. HASHTAG MEH. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, JOIN ME NOW FOR D.E.M. LOCK LIPS, 2012, WAIT, DO LEAVE, HERE'S A PICTURE OF TAYLOR LAUTNER EDITION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TO THE ELECTION! I WILL MAKE THIS WORK! TWO MEN BATTLE IN THIS ELECTION. ONE OF THEM BELONGING TO A VERY OLD, VERY PALE CLAN OF ANCIENT BLOOD SUCKERS. (LAUGHTER) THE OTHER A WILD YOUNG AND DIVERSE FERAL GROUP OF INCOHERENT PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) BOTH COMPETING FOR SOMETHING ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN POSSESS. A FOUR-YEAR CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED TERM HEADING OUR NATION'S EXECUTIVE BRANCH. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN THE LOVE OF AN UNDERAGED WOMAN NAMED AMERICA. (LAUGHTER) ONE OF THE MEN, THE VAMPIRE... (LAUGHTER). ... HAS CHOSEN... WHAT IS THE VAMPIRE EQUIVALENT OF A VICE PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE. GODDAMNIT! WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PAUL RYAN! HE'S GOT THE REPUBLICAN BASE ALL FIRED UP. AND IN HIS FIRST SPEECH AS THE V.P. NOMINEE ON SATURDAY HE MADE IT CLEAR HE IS HERE TO FIX WHAT  AILS US.
HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, DECLINING INCOMES AND CRUSHING DEBT IS NOT A NEW NORMAL. IT IS THE RESULT OF MISGUIDED POLICIES.
Jon: (LAUGHS) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE HAS MISGUIDED... (LAUGHTER). ANYWAY, WHAT PAUL RYAN IS SAYING IS THAT WE ARE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DEBT AND THAT IS DUE  TO WHAT HE IS SAYING ARE THE MISGUIDED POLICIES OF WE ARE TO ASSUME BARACK OBAMA. SO LET'S LOOK AT HOW WE WENT FROM A 1990s SURPLUS TO THIS ENORMOUS PUBLICLY HELD DEBT. LET'S SEE, $1.7 TRILLION OF THE DEBT COMES FROM THE BUSH TAX CUTS. TWO FOREIGN WARS. THAT AIN'T CHEAP. MEDICARE D PLAN, THAT WAS NEW ENTITLEMENT SPENDING. THERE WAS SOME EXTRA DEFENSE SPENDING THAT WAS IN THERE. MORE TAX CUTS. THERE WAS THE TARP BANK BAILOUT. THAT'S A LOT OF DEBT. I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF AN IRRESPONSIBLE LUNATIC WOULD VOTE FOR EVERY ONE OF THESE MISGUIDED  FISCAL TIME BOMBS? I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT. HIS NAME BEGINS WITH PAUL RYAN AND ENDS WITH SILENCE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND THIS IS HIS PICTURE! WELL, THAT WAS WONKY BUT I'M BEGINNING TO THINK PAUL RYAN'S  PAST POSITIONS DON'T REALLY HOLD UP TO THE LIGHT OF DAY. MUCH LIKE EDWARD CULLEN. (LAUGHTER) AND ACTUAL LIGHT OF DAY. (LAUGHS)
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH, JON.
Jon: HUH? JOHN HODGMAN, WHAT ARE COW DOING HERE?
I'M SENDING THIS SICK CHARADE YOUR FEEBLE AND CRAVEN ATTEMPT  AT CO-OPTING ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MOVIES IN MODERN SEXY FANTASY LITERATURE. (LAUGHTER) ALSO KNOWN AS HORROROTICA.
Jon:ER WHO...
NO, HORROR... THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS VAMPIRES AREN'T YOUR STUFFY OLD WORLD I WANT TO SUCK YOUR BLOOD ROMANIAN  ARISTOCRACY TYPES TO WHO EVAPORATE IN DAYLIGHT. NO, THEY'RE YOUNG AND SEXY AND SHIRTLESS. AND WHEN THE SUNLIGHT HITS THEM THEY SPARKLE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I SEE. I GUESS WHEN IT RAINS...
WELL, WHEN IT RAINS THEY PLAY BASEBALL, OBVIOUSLY. THEY'RE VAMPIRES. SERIOUSLY, THEY PLAY BASEBALL IN THUNDERSTORMS FOR THEIR MIGHTY BACK CRACKS WOULD OTHERWISE  ATTRACT UNWANTED ATTENTION OF TOWNSFOLK. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE DUMBEST...
NO, NO, JON, JON! YOUR DEMO IS LISTENING, JON. AFTER ALL, WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE SHOW GROWING UP?
"BANANA SPLIT."
SORRY, WHAT? WHAT?
"BANANA SPLITS."
"BANANA SPLITS" YES. FOUR PSYCHOTIC FOURRIES WHO LIVED IN A PSYCHEDELIC CLUBHOUSE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: POINT TAKEN. ANY WAY, THE SPENDING PAUL RYAN WAS THE OLD PAUL RYAN. HE APPEARED TO HAVE AN EPIPHANY ABOUT SPENDING SOME TIME AROUND WHEN THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER THE  BUDGET AND IS NOW AN IDEA MAN.
WE HAVE HEARD A GROWING NUMBER OF COMPARISONS BETWEEN MR. RYAN AND FORMER PRESIDENT  RONALD REAGAN.
PAUL RYAN HAS BEEN THE ONE WHO'S LED THE CHARGE ON ENTITLEMENT REFORM.
PROBABLY THE SMARTEST PERSON I KNOW IN POLITICS.
HE'S ACTUALLY DONE THE INTELLECTUAL WORK, THE RIGOROUS WORK OF PUTTING DETAILED  PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE.
PAUL RYAN HAS BECOME AN INTELLECTUAL LIEDER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
Jon: IN FACT, I, MITT ROMNEY, AMEERLY A WELL-CHISELED  DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR OUR NATION'S REAL FUTURE LEADER. I AM THE FLAVORLESS GEL CAP SURROUNDING THE BITTER FISCAL MEDICINE WE SO DESPERATELY NEED  TO SURVIVE A FLAVORLESS HUNK. THEY'RE... OH. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, SO WHEN DO WE START IMPLEMENTING RYAN'S GENIUS PLANS  LIKE DEFUNDING MEDICAID AND CONVERTING IT INTO BLOCK GRANTS AND HE HAD ONE PLAN FOR  PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY A WHILE BACK AND TRANSFORMING MEDICARE INTO JUST A VOUCHER  SYSTEM WHILE REDUCING THE TAX BURDEN ON OUR NATION'S OVERBURDENED SUPERRICH ALLOWING  THEM TO SOAR LIKE VAMPIRES THAT CAN'T ACTUALLY FLY BUT ARE SO STRONG THAT WHEN THEY JUMP IT  LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE (BLEEP)ING FLYING! SO I GUESS THAT'S WHAT... (LAUGHTER).
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
Jon: FINALLY, WITH THE SELECTION OF PAUL RYAN THE REPUBLICANS WILL BE PUTTING  THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTHS ARE PHILOSOPHICALLY. RIGHT, EVERY REPUBLICAN WHO'S EVER BEEN ASKED ABOUT RYAN'S  SOMEWHAT AUSTERE PLANS OVER THE LAST 72 HOURS?
I THINK THAT MITT ROMNEY APPRECIATES AND ADMIRES THE WORK AND THE IDEAS THAT PAUL RYAN HAS DONE. BUT MITT ROMNEY HAS HIS OWN PLAN.
GOVERNOR ROMNEY HAS SAID HE'S GOING TO HAVE HIS OWN PLAN AND DOES HAVE HIS OWN PLAN.
IT SOUNDS AWFULLY LIKE THE PAUL RYAN MEDICARE PLAN!
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BUT DON'T GO THERE, SOLEDAD. WHERE DID YOU GET THE BALLS, LIBERAL MEDIA, TO SUGGEST MITT ROMNEY'S MEDICARE PLAN IS IN ANY  WAY SIMILAR TO RYAN'S PLAN FOR MEDICARE?
MY PLAN FOR MEDICARE IS VERY SIMILAR TO HIS PLAN FOR MEDICARE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT GUY IS TOTALLY IN THE TANK FOR OBAMA! (APPLAUSE) WAIT. I'M SURE GOVERNOR ROMNEY CAN CLEAR UP THIS CONFUSION.
I'M SURE THERE ARE PLACES THAT MY BUDGET IS DIFFERENT THAN  HIS, BUT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE. THE ITEMS THAT WE AGREE ON I THINK OUTWEIGH ANY DIFFERENCES THERE MAY BE. WE HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH PIECE BY PIECE.
Jon: BASICALLY WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THE BUDGET PLANS FOR THE TWO OF THEM ARE VERY  DIFFERENT BUT REALLY MOSTLY THE SAME ALTHOUGH WE REALLY HAVEN'T COMPARED THEM YET. (LAUGHTER) THIS CAMPAIGN IS MORE CONFUSING ABOUT A MOVIE WITH A VAMPIRE INN  LOVE WITH A NON-VAMPIRE GIRL WHOSE OTHER BOYFRIEND IS A WARE WOLF AND ISN'T AS MUCH INTO HER  BUT INTO HER BABY RENEZMAY. (LAUGHTER)
OH, YOU CYNIC. "TWILIGHT" IS LIKE THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO FREE  YOUR SPIRIT AND HAVE A BLATANT AND UTTER DISREGARD FOR LOGIC. "TWILIGHT" IS LIKE FOX NEWS. IT'S NOT MEANT FOR YOUR MIND. YOU WATCH IT WITH YOUR HEART. (LAUGHTER) AND YOUR GUT. JON, YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE DEAD INSIDE NOT TO SEE THAT.
Jon: WOULD I? MWAHAHA! (LAUGHS)
JON! BITE ME IS! BITE ME!
Jon: IT WAS JUST A STUPID EFFECT.
NO, BITE ME, I SAY. I WANT TO LIVE FOREVER, BITE ME!
Jon: JOHN HODGMAN,
