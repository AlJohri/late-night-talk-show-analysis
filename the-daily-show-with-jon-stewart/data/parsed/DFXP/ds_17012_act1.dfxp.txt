OCTOBER 27th, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DILLEY SHOW WITH JON STEWART   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO WILL BE JOINING US. A FINE MAN, WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE HIM ON THE PROGRAM. BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN THE FIELD OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS HAVE. YOU BEEN FOLLOWING THE GOP PRESIDENTIAL RACE YOU KNOW THAT HIT ENS ROMNEY HAS  BEEN-- MITTENS ROMNEY HAS BEEN THE UNCONTESTED FRONT-RUNNER FOR EVERYONE'S SECOND CHOICE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. HE'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S INSTALLMENT OF INDECISION 2012, SCARED MITTLESS. (LAUGHTER) WHEN POLLING BEGAN A YEAR AGO, POLLING BEGAN A YEAR AGO FOR THE REPUBLICAN  PRESIDENTIAL RACE MITT ROMNEY WAS POLLING IN THE LOW -- AND WAS IN SECOND PLACE. AND SINCE THEN SO MUCH HAS CHANGED.
MINNESOTA CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN SURGING AHEAD OF THE 2012 FIELD.
HUCKABEE LEADS 19% A ROMNEY IS TRAILING, WITH 18%.
GALLUP HAS PERRY LEADING WITH 29%, MITT ROMNEY NOW SECOND WITH 17%.
THEN GOVERNOR CHRISTIE TIED FOR FIRST PLACE WITH THE FORMER MASSACHUSETTS  GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY.
IN THE LATEST CNN POLL OF REPUBLICANS ROMNEY CAME IN SECOND TO RUDY GIULIANI WHO  IS NOT EVEN RUNNING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IN FACT, TONIGHT HE IS LOSING TO REE ANIMATED RONALD REAGAN. OR REAGAN. LOWER TAXES ON BRAINS. (LAUGHTER) BUT AS FRONT-RUNNERS HAVE COME AND GONE ROMNEY REMAINS. LET'S CHECK IN WHERE HE'S AT RIGHT NOW.
NOW A YEAR LATER MITT ROMNEY SITS AT ABOUT 23% SUPPORT. MITT ROMNEY IS MR. 23%.
Jon: MR. 23%. STILL A BETTER NICK NAME THAN MITT. SO WHEN IT AM COULDS TO HIS POLLING NUMBERS MITT ROMNEY HAS BEEN NOTHING IF NOT CONSISTENT WHICH IS  INTERESTING, GIVEN THAT IN EVERY OTHER REGARD, HE HAS BEEN SHOCKINGLY INCONSISTENT. HOW HAS HE MANAGED TO NEITHER GAIN NOR LOSE SUPPORT. TO REMAIN INERT, IF HE WERE A COLOR HE WOULD BE BEIGE. IF HE WERE AN ICE CREAM FLAVOR, HE'D BE BEIGE. (LAUGHTER) WELL, HERE'S HOW HE DOES IT. IN JUNE ROMNEY POSTS ON FACEBOOK THAT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF A BALLOT INITIATIVE TO CONTINUE  RESTRICTING THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS OF TEACHERS, POLICEMAN AND FIREFIGHTERS. A BOLD STAND THAT COULD GAIN HIM MAYBE A 3 TO 5% BUMP AMONGST THE REPUBLICAN BASE, HUNGRY TO RESTRAIN UNIONS. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE HE COULD LOSE HIM SUPPORT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION FOR  PEOPLE NOT AS CONVINCED THAT PUBLIC SERVICE UNIONS ARE SOCIALISM. HOW DO YOU SOLVE THAT PROBLEM? SMASH CUT TO TWO DAYS AGO, MITT ROMNEY STANDING OUTSIDE THE REPUBLICAN CALL CENTER IN OHIO THAT HE HAS JUST  VISITED THAT IS WORKING TO PASS THE BALLOT INITIATIVES HE HAS PREVIOUSLY FRIENDED.
I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT THE PARTICULAR BALLOT ISSUES. THOSE ARE UNDER THE PEOPLE OF OHIO BUT I SUPPORT THE EFFORT OF THE GOVERNOR TO RAIL IN THE SCALE OF GOVERNMENT. I'M NOT TERRIBLY FAMILIAR WITH THE TWO BALLOT INITIATIVES.
Jon: NOT FAMILIAR, YOU THUMBS UP THEM ON FACEBOOK! (LAUGHTER) YOU JUST VISITED WITH REPUBLICANS WORKING TO PASS THEM BEHIND-- WHAT DID YOU  SAY TO THEM DURING THE VISIT?
I WANT EVERYONE IN HERE TO KNOW I STAND NEAR YOU. (LAUGHTER) SO KEEP UP THE WORK. (LAUGHTER) SO ANY BUMP THAT ROMNEY WOULD GET TO SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE FROM THE  REPUBLICAN BASE IS NOW GONE. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE MAYBE HE'LL GAIN SOME RESPECT AND A BUMP FROM MORE CENTRIST  MODERATE REPUBLICANS OR INDEPENDENTS FOR BEING NONCOMMITTAL. HOW CAN HE [BLEEP] THAT UP? (LAUGHTER) SMASH CUT TO THE NEXT DAY.
I'M SORRY IF I CREATED ANY CONFUSION IN THAT REGARD. I FULLY SUPPORT GOVERNOR KASICH'S-- I THINK IS CALLED QUESTION TWO IN OHIO. FULLY SUPPORT THAT.
Jon: FULLY SUPPORT, SO WHAT WAS YOUR YESTERDAY-- I DON'T KNOW, COULD BE DOING  ANYTHING IN THAT BUILDING, I DON'T KNOW. COULD BE A VERIZE ON CALL CENTER FOR ALL I KNOW.
I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER BALLOT QUESTIONS THERE IN OHIO AND I WASN'T TAKING A  POSITION ON THOSE. I DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM WHAT I THINK THEY OUGHT TO DO IN THAT REGARD. ONE OF THEM, FOR INSTANCE, RELATES TO HEALTH CARE AND MANDATES. I'VE SAID THAT THAT SHOULD BE UP TO INDEPENDENT STATES. I TOOK MY STATE IN ONE DIRECTION. THEY MAY WANT TO GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW DOES A MORMON END UP SOUNDING LIKE JACKIE MASON. (LAUGHTER)
THEY COULD TAKE IF IN ONE DIRECTION, MAYBE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. -- I WAS GOING THIS, BA-DING. HEALTH CARE, THE THING, ON THE OTHER HAND, BOOM, BOOM, HEY, HO. (APPLAUSE) WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
AND YOU TRY TO DISTRACT THE REPUBLICAN BASE FROM YOUR WISHY WASHY UNION STAND  BY BRINGING UP YOUR HEALTH-CARE PLAN? ROMNEYCARE? THEY HATE THAT. THAT'S LIKE GOING HEY, WHY'S EVERYBODY LOOKING AT THE PIMP EL ON MY NOSE. A [BLEEP] MY PANTS! NOW--  (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ON A SUPERFICIAL LEVEL, ROMNEY'S SUPERFICIALIALITY WOULD  APPEAR TO BE A DETRIMENT IN EVER MOVING BEYOND HIS 23% BUT I BELIEVE HIS  SUPERFICIALIALITY IS THE KEY TO HIS STRATEGY. HE IS CLEARLY SURVEYED THE REPUBLICAN FIELD AND DECIDED I THINK 23%'S ENOUGH TO BEAT  ANY OF THESE YAHOO!s. (LAUGHTER) SEE RIGHT NOW HERMAN CAIN SHOT UP FROM 8% TO THE MID 30s. HE'S BEATING ROMNEY. IS HE A LONG-TERM THREAT TO MITT ROMNEY?
WE DON'T HAVE A --
IT'S GOK LECH CUTED.
ELECTRIFIED.
COULD GOING TO BE A SIGN ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT SAYS IT WILL KILL YOU.
AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED.
SO YOU ARE SAYING ANY COMMUNITY IF THEY WANT TO BAN A MOSQUE.
YES, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB AND YOU ARE NOT RICH, BLAME YOURSELF.
AND WOULD ASK ME WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF UBEKI BEKI BEKI BEKI STANOZOLOL I AM  GOING TO SAY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IF THEY WANT ME TO VISIT CROATIA I'M GOING TO BE LIKE HEY, WHAT KIND OF [BLEEP] NAME IS THAT. SPEAK ENGLISH OVER HERE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY ROMNEY DOESN'T HAVE TO REALLY SAY ANYTHING. HIS STRATEGY IN THE DEBATE SHOULD JUST BE HEY, MAN, I'M HERE BUT I CEDE MY TIME  WHICH BRINGS TO US RICK PERRY. GOVERNOR OF TEXAS ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE POSING FOR A BOX FOR JUST FOR MEN HAIR COLORING. (LAUGHTER) HE'S DOWN IN THE POLLS--  (APPLAUSE) HE'S DOWN IN THE POLLS  BECAUSE OF SOME POOR DEBATE PERFORMANCES AND QUESTIONABLE HUNTING GROUND CHOICES. (LAUGHTER) SO HE'S GOT TWO CHOICES AT THE BLACK JACK TABLE OF THE ELECTION. HIT OR STAY. HERMAN CAIN OR ROMNEY. WELL, WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT HE CHOOSES WHEN HE INTRODUCES HIS NEW TAX PLAN.
THE BEST REPRESENTATION OF MY PLAN IS THIS-- .
Jon: OH, [BLEEP] GET DOWN HE'S GOT A GUN. (LAUGHTER)
THE BEST REPRESENTATION IN MY PLAN IS THIS POSTCARD. THIS IS THE SIZE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW, CENTRAL TO MY PLAN IS GETTING EVERY AMERICAN THE OPTION OF A 20% FLAT TAX  ON THEIR INCOME.
Jon: HOLY SMOKES HE DIDN'T JUST TAKE A HIT, HE IS DOUBLING DOWN ON CAIN. [BLEEP] WHAT'S HERMAN CAIN'S PLAN, NINE-NINE-NINE, THAT'S THREE DIGIT, RIGHT? MY PLAN'S TWO DIGITS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IT'S ON A POSTCARD. GIVES ME ROOM TO STICK IT ON ONE DIGIT AND STICK IT ON A POST-IT NOTE. HERE'S THE THING RICK PERRY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. IN THE RACE TO BE THE CRAZIEST THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE. AND NO ONE PUTS HERMAN IN A CORNER. ♪ IMAGINE THERE'S NO PIZZA ♪ ♪.
Jon: ALL OF WHICH BRINGS TO US OUR NEW SEGMENT, OH MY GOD HERMAN CAIN IS EITHER  GOING TO BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OR OUR NEXT AMERICAN IDOL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (C
