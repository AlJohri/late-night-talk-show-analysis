Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE MAYOR OF LONDON. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED JOHNSON'S LIFE OF LONDON. THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THE CITY THAT MADE THE WORLD. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM LONDON MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON. SIR.   ( APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Jon: HOW ARE YOU? VERY WELL, THANK YOU Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. JOHNSON'S LIFE OF LONDON. THERE YOU GET THE PICTURE. THE DOUBLE DECKER BUS. THERE'S A CAT ON IT ASSUME. YOU'RE A MAYOR.
I AM Jon: OF A MAJOR METROPOLIS. LET ME MOVE ALL THIS FOR A SECOND. STAY WITH ME. I APOLOGIZE FOR HOW WINDY IT WAS BACK STAGE BY THE WAY. HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. WHICH OF THESE IS MARIJUANA, ABOUT AN OUNCE, AND IS...
NO, NO, NO Jon: 22 OUNCES. THIS IS AN OUNCE. THIS IS NOT LIGHT. THIS IS AN OUNCE. WHICH OF THESE IN LONDON, AS THE MAYOR, WOULD YOU PENALIZE MORE HEAVILY? THIS LARGE SOFT DRINK OR THIS LARGE...
ILLEGAL HIGHLY DAMAGING NARCOTIC
Jon: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS?
WHAT IS THIS Jon: THAT IS A SOFT DRINK, A COCA-COLA. OUR MAYOR WHO IS ALSO THE MAYOR OF A MAJOR METROPOLIS. IF YOU WERE TO SELL SOMEONE THIS IN A RESTAURANT, $200 FINE. IF YOU'RE CAUGHT WITH THIS, $100 FINE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WOULD YOU DO THAT? TALK TO ME.
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING. HE EXPLAINED THIS TO ME VERY CAREFULLY
Jon: DID HE USE THESE? NO. BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO, YOU CAN GET THIS IN TWO AND IT'S FINE. I THINK THAT WAS HIS EXPLANATION OF HOW IT WASN'T AN INFRINGEMENT. LOOK, LOOK AT THE REALITY. THE REALITY IS WE'RE ALL... SPEAKING PERSONALLY, IT IS A PROBLEM IN A CITY. IT'S A PROBLEM IN A PLACE LIKE LONDON.
Jon: NO QUESTION IT'S A PROBLEM. DID YOU SEE THE FOOD AND THE ICE CREAM WE'RE ALLOWED TO POUR IN OUR GULL ITS WITH A FUNNEL?
I DID. IT'S A FANTASTIC CITY. I WAS BORN IN NEW YORK.
Jon: I CAN HEAR THE ACCENT GREAT TO BE BACK HERE Jon: WHERE WERE YOU BORN? IN NEW YORK GENERAL HOSPITAL. Jon: OKAY I WAS. Jon: WHEN DID YOU LEAVE? BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE CLOSE TO MY MOTHER. ONE OF THE POINTS I WANTED TO MAKE IN THIS BOOK WHICH I'M ENCOURAGED BY MY PUBLISHERS IS...
Jon: DID YOU LEAVE BECAUSE OF THE SODAS? WAS IT THE OVERSIZED SODAS THAT DROVE YOU FROM THE CITY? WAS IT A DROWNING FEAR AS A YOUNGSTER?
I HADN'T REALIZED... IS THAT REALLY ILLEGAL? THAT ONE IS TOO BIG?
Jon: ILLEGAL. THAT IS ILLEGAL IN A THEATER OF CINEMA. THAT IS ILLEGAL IN A RESTAURANT. $100 FINE. $200 FINE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M A GREAT FAN OF MAYOR BLOOMBERG. INDEED I DON'T SEE WHY HE'S RULED HIMSELF OUT FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL THING. THAT'S MY VIEW. I THINK HE WOULD BE A VERY GOOD CANDIDATE
Jon: THAT WOULD BE THE PLACE WHERE NORMALLY YOU WOULD SAY THAT AND THE PEOPLE WOULD APPLAUD.
WHY DIDN'T THEY? WHY WAS THERE ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT
Jon: BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO MAKE SODA ILLEGAL. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. HE THINKS IT'S GOING TO BE VERY POPULAR. HANG ON. LIKE THE BAN ON SMOKING
Jon: BUT NOBODY GETS SECONDHAND CARBONATION. THE IDEA WAS, I THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS OBESITY IS A PROBLEM. I THINK IT'S A COMPLEX THING OF SOCIETAL INCENTIVES AND OTHER THINGS. I THINK PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS AND SAY, WELL, THAT'S JUST SILLY.
WHAT I WILL SAY OBVIOUSLY IS REFUGEES FROM THE SODA TYRANNY  IN NEW YORK WILL HAVE SANCTUARY IN LONDON. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  IF YOU DO
Jon: (LAUGHING) I DON'T WANT TO BE IN ANYWAY CHAUVINISTIC OR GO OVER THE  PRAISES OF MY CITY WHICH ARE MENTIONED IN THIS BOOK. IF YOU DO WISH TO COME AND DRINK COCA-COLA, DO IT.
Jon: VERY KIND OF YOU. BORIS JOHNSON IS SAYING TO AMERICA RIGHT NOW, COME TO THE AMSTERDAM OF SODA. YOU ARE THE AMSTERDAM OF MOUNTAIN DEW. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING?
YOU HUDDLE MASSES YEARNING TO BREAK FREE, COME...
Jon: THE MASCOT OF THE 2012 OLYMPICS. LET ME JUST BREAK THIS NEWS. THE MASCOT IS A WALKING BIG GULP WITH GIANT ARMS. IS THAT CORRECT?
NO, THE MASCOT IS ACTUALLY... IT'S... ALTHOUGH THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
Jon: WE SAW THEM I HOPE YOU WILL COME THIS SUMMER. IT...
Jon: TO LONDON FOR THE OLYMPICS?
IT WILL BE SUPERB. Jon: YES, I'LL BE THERE. WHY CAN'T WE WATCH YOUR SHOW MORE ON TV IN ENGLAND? IS IT A PROFANITY PROBLEM
Jon: I DON'T CONTROL THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM. IT'S LIKE MIKE TV. IT COULD GO ALL AROUND THE WORLD. NOT SO FAST, ENGLAND. JOHNSON'S LIFE OF LONDON. IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. IT'S AN EXCITING TIME TO BE IN LONDON
IT IS. Jon: THE JUBILEE, THE OLYMPICS, EVERYTHING IS GOING YOUR WAY EXCEPT FOR OBVIOUSLY  THE SOCIAL UNREST CAUSED BY AUSTERITY. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT IS ALL GOING YOUR WAY
AND WE NOW HAVE THIS HUGE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE WHICH YOU'VE JUST MENTIONED. I'LL SAY IT'S MORE OR LESS A FAIR APPROACH TO SOFT DRINKS.
Jon: BORIS JOHNSON. BUY THE BOOK. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
