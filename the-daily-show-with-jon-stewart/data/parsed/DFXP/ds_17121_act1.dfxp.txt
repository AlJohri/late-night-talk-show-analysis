FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:ING TWO "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, VERY EXCITING, ANDREW GARFIELD, 20th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND HE LOOKS AMAZING. LISTEN, IF YOU WATCHED THE SHOW FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED A BIT ABOUT  GOVERNOR CUOMO IN NEW YORK HIS PLANS TO DECRIMINALIZE SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIJUANA. YOU WOULD BE PERMITTED TO CARRY UP TO 25 GRAMS FOR PERSONAL USE WITHOUT GETTING ARRESTED. TO REMIND YOU, 25 GRAMS IS IS-- IT'S SNUFF TO FILL THIS. IT'S ENOUGH TO FILL THIS-- I THINK WE MUST HAVE MICE HERE BECAUSE IT WAS UP TO HERE, AND  THERE WERE, LIKE, FIVE BAGS OF DORITOS AROUND HERE. ( LAUGHTER ). AND THEY'RE ALL-- THAT'S FINE. NEVER MIND, JUST TO SHOW YOU. LET ME JUST GET THAT. SO IT'S-- BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL, THIS IS LABELED SO THAT I KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ). ANYWAY, SO I JUST WANT TO REFILL IT UP TO SHOW YOU WHAT WOULD BE LEGAL, YOU KNOW.
GOVERNOR CUOMO TODAY CONFIRMING HIS PROPOSAL TO DECRIMINALIZE SMALL AMOUNTOF  MARIJUANA IS DEAD. SO IT WENT UP IN SMOKE FOLLOWING OPPOSITION IN THE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED STATE SENATE.
OOOOH!
Jon:  WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME JUST ONE SECOND? ( LAUGHTER ) ( TOILET FLUSHING ) PROBABLY WONDERING WHY I HAVE I TOILET UNDER THERE. ( LAUGHTER ). SEEING AS THE SHOW IS 22 MINUTES LONG. ( LAUGHTER ). HEY, MAN, I'M NOT SUPERMAN. LOOK, HERE'S THE CRAZY PART-- THIS BILL IS DEAD IN NEW YORK, BUT IN NEW JERSEY, THE STATE ASSEMBLY VOTED MONDAY TO DECRIMINALIZE 15 GRAMS OF POT, BUT THEIR GOVERNOR DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT.
GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE SAYS HE'S GOING TO VETO IT. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING HE IS IN SUPPORT OF.
Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, PEOPLE? WE'RE A GOV-SWAP AWAY FROM MAKING THE GARDEN STATE THE ( BLEEP ) LOOK AT THAT GARDEN STATE! ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE TOO HARD TO GET EITHER ONE OF THESE  GUYS TO TOUCH A SKULL, GET DRUNK, AND PEE INTO A FOUNTAIN AND DO THE WHOLE SWITCH. WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH VETOING IT, CHRIS CHRISTIE? I THOUGHT YOU WERE COOL, MAN.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHETHER YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE, STILL SAYS MARIJUANA IS AN ILLEGAL DRUG. I DON'T THINK THE STATE SHOULD BE IN THE BUSINESS OF UNDERCUTTING THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT ON THAT POLICY.
Jon:  AS MUCH AS I DISAGREE, I DON'T THINK MARIJUANA SHOULD BE ILLEGAL, BUT  IT IS ILLEGAL ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. GOVERNOR CHRISTIE IS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, A MAN OF CONVICTION.
HE INTEND TO GO FORWARD. IF SOMEONE WANTS TO STOP US, THEY'LL HAVE TO TAKE ACTION TO TRY TO STOP US.
Jon:  WHAT THE ( BLEEP )! WAIT! HOW DID GOVERNOR-- GUYS STOP SMOKING POT, IT'S AGAINST THE LAW-- GO DIRTY HARRY ON IGNORING  THE FEDERAL BAN ON SPORTS GAMBLING. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO?
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US ARE OF THE ILLUSION THAT BETTING ON  NFL GAMES ISN'T HAPPENING EVERY WEEK IN NEW JERSEY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  OKAY. I HAVE AN IDEA. LET'S REPLACE THE PHRASE "BETTING ON NFL GAMES" WITH THE  PHRASE "GETTING HIGH." ( LAUGHTER ) DIFFERENT HOW?
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT FEELING 30 OR 40 YEARS AGO, BUT THE FACT IS NOW GAMING  IS EVERYWHERE.
Jon:  LET'S REPLACE THE WORD "GAMING" WITH THE PHRASE  "GETTING HIGH." ( LAUGHTER ) STILL NOT SEEING WHY CHALLENGING FEDERAL LAW FOR GAMBLING IS  OKAY, CHALLENGING IT FOR POT IS NOT OKAY.
LET'S HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT FROM IT BE THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, NOT  CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS NEW JERSEY, WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM IT NOW.
Jon:  OKAY, WELL LET'S REPLACE-- ( LAUGHTER ) ACTUALLY, YOU DON'T NEED TO  REPLACE ANY WORDS IN THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) FOR IT TO BE A JUSTIFICATION TO DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA. I KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS. GOVERNOR. SPORTS BETTING AND WEED ARE NOT AS DIFFERENT AS YOU MIGHT THINK. CLEARLY, GAMING IS YOUR THING. THAT'S COOL. HERE'S WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO. WHY DON'T YOU JUST THINK OF USING MARIJUANA AS BETTING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER DAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SO YOU KNOW, CHRIS CHRISTIE IS HARDLY-- CHRIS CHRISTIE IS  HARDLY THE ONLY POLITICIAN TO FIGURE OUT THAT MARIJUANA CAN BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR CAREER. WYATT CENAC HAS MORE.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE ITS VIEWS ABOUT THE WAR ON DRUGS EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR--
MARIJUANA ADVOCATES ACCUSE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OF CRACKING DOWN MORE ON MEDICAL  MARIJUANA THAN GEORGE BUSH EVER DID.
RAIDS AND OTHER TACTICS HAVE FORCED AS MANY AS 200 GROWERS AND DISTRIBUTORS TO CEASE OPERATION.
WHICH IS INTERESTING CONSIDERING A NEW BIOGRAPHY THAT REVEALS DETAILS ABOUT OBAMA'S USE.
SOME OF HIS BUDDIES HAD THE CHEW GANG. WHICH WAS BASICALLY BASKETBALL AND SMOKING DOPE.
OBAMA WAS A STONER? SURELY THIS MUST OUTRAGE THOSE WHO REVERE THE AUTHOR OF THE PRESIDENCY, LIKE DORIS KERNS GOODWIN.
A REBELLIOUS STREAK IN A POTENTIAL PRESIDENT IS A VERY HEALTHY THING, AND ESPECIALLY  SOMETHING LIKE THE CHUME GANG, WHICH WAS FUN AND THAT'S JUST FINE.
SOME HAVE MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS MAY SEEM HYPOCRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT.
YOU'RE IN A VERY DIFFERENT POSITION ONCE YOU'RE PRESIDENT  VERSUS A TEENAGER WHO IS ENJOYING A WEED.
ARMED WITH HER INSIGHT I ASSEMBLED A PANEL OF YOUNG AND NOT-SO-YOUNG POTENTIAL  PRESIDENTS, ALL BOASTING A HEALTHY REBELLIOUS STREAKS BUT COULD THEY HANDLE THE DAY-TO-DAY  CHALLENGES A PRESIDENT MUST FACE. YOU'RE MEETING WITH THE LEADER OF RUSSIA. HOW DO YOU GET HIM TO ASSIST WITH THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA? YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'LL SWITCH THAT QUESTION. WE'LL SKIP IT, THAT'S FINE. EUROPE'S ECONOMY IS ON THE BRINK. HOW DO YOU-- KEITH REALLY, REALLY? RIGHT NOW?
ALL RIGHT.
Jon:  NO, IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT. I'M ASKING YOU QUESTIONS!
THIS ONE.
YOU SAID ONE. PUT IT DOWN.
HOW DO YOU AVOID A MELTDOWN OF THE EURO ZONE, KEITH? THEIR ECONOMY IS ON THE BRINK.
UHM, VOMIT? YOU KNOW WHAT, EAT YOUR CHIPS. JUST EAT YOUR ( BLEEP ) CHIPS. I NEEDED HELP SO I BROUGHT IN ROB CAMPIA A WASHINGTON POLITICAL EXPERT TO GROOM SOME  OF THESE POTENTIAL PRESIDENTS.
IT'S USEFUL TO PICK ONE ISSUE THAT OVERRIDES SOME OF THE OTHER  ISSUES THAT YOU'LL BE RUNNING ON. FOR INSTANCE, WITH OBAMA, HEALTH CARE WAS HIS SIGNATURE ISSUE.
PANEL, WHAT WOULD YOUR SIGNATURE ISSUE BE?
I WOULD PROBABLY THROW A CONCERT ON THE US WHAT LAWN.
JOHN?
UHM...
ALL RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ).
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU LIKE THIS, THERE'S THREE TYPES OF WEED. YOU'VE GOT YOUR SOUR, YOUR.
SO YOUR PLATFORM IS THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WEED.
YES, YES, ACTUALLY.
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT STRIKES AS PRESIDENTIAL ABOUT THEM. MORGAN HAS HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS. RICK?
WHO THE ( BLEEP ) IS RICK.
RICK! RICK! RICK! WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) ARE YOU DOING? STOP PLAYING WITH THE CAMERA! GET BACK TO YOUR SEAT, MAN. LET'S FOCUS, GUYS. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN?
I WOULD JUST SAY WHY CAN'T WE JUST BE FRIENDS? ( LAUGHTER )
NO, DON'T SING. DO NOT SING A SONG.
THAT WAS A GOOD SONG  ♪ WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS  WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS  ♪ ♪
TONIGHT SING A SONG, GUYS  ♪ WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS  ♪ ♪
I'LL TELL YOU WHY-- BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL A BUN OF STONERS! THEY WERE HOPELESS. YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE PRESIDENT. YOU, THOUGH, SEEM TON WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. HOW ABOUT?
MY PROBLEM IS I WAS ARRESTED AND PUT IN JAIL FOR THREE MONTHS  FOR GROWING MARIJUANA AND GOT TWO CONSPIRACY CHARGE BECAUSE I HAD TWO ROOMMATES LIVING WITH ME.
THAT'S MESSED UP.
I HAVE THREE FELONIES ON MY RECORD NOW.
HOLD ON FOR WHEREON SECOND.  ONE SECOND-- QUICK QUESTION, HAVE ANY PRESIDENTS EVER BEEN ELECTED WITH A FELONY ON THEIR RECORDS?
NOT THEY KNOW OF.
THIS GUY GOT BUSTED AND HE NOW CAN'T BE PRESIDENT.
WELL, IT SUCTION FOR THIS GUY. HE GOT CAUGHT. OBAMA DIDN'T.
I GOTTA BE HONEST-- IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR YOU TO BE PRESIDENT.
YES, I KNOW, EVEN THOUGH OBAMA AND I DID THE SAME THING AT THE SAME AGE, THE DIFFERENCE  IS THAT I ACTUALLY SPENT THREE MONTHS IN JAIL.
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS  ISSUE, THE PRESIDENT'S NOT A KIND BUD. WHERE DID YOU GO? GUYS? REALLY? WHERE ARE YOU? HELLO!  ♪ WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS  ♪ ♪
COME ON, GUYS! PLEASE. UN WHAT, NONE OF YOU ARE GOING TO BE PRESIDENT. WE'RE DONE. ARE WE DONE? GOOD  ♪ WHY CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS  ♪
