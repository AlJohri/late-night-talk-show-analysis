MAY 4, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, THAT SOUND OF THAT DATE. YES! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, DAVID BARTON, THE CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR. GLENN BECK CALLS HIM THE MOST IMPORTANT MAN IN AMERICA, SO IT IS CLEARLY NOT DAVID BARTON, THE  MAN BEHIND THE CHAIN OF NEW YORK FITNESS CENTERS IN CHELSEA. ALTHOUGH MAYBE IT IS THE SAME GUY. [LAUGHTER] THAT WOULD BE WEIRD. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE DEATH OF THE WORLD'S MOST WANTED  TERRORIST, OBAMA -- DAMMIT. OH, HOLD ON. THERE WE GO. THERE WE GO. SORRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT? I MADE A MISTAKE. OBAMA CAPTURED OSAMA. IT IS A PHONETICALLY DIFFICULT STORY. WE ALL DO IT. I THINK IT'S PART OF OBAMA'S PLAN TO FIX THE DEFICIT. DUDE'S PLAYING CHESS. WHERE WAS I? IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS SINCE WE LEARNED OF OSAMA BIN LADEN'S DEMISE, AND THE NEWS OF HIS  DEATH HAS SENT AMERICA ON HOLIDAY, SPENDING ALL DAY AT HOME IN BED, PINT OF HAAGEN-DAZS  WATCHING "COUNTRY STRONG" OVER AND OVER ON PAY-PER-VIEW. IT'S... OH. I'M BEING TOLD WE'RE NOT CELEBRATING. WE'RE JUST STILL UNEMPLOYED. OH. [LAUGHTER] STILL, GOOD MOVIE, GOOD ICE CREAM. MY POINT IS WE'VE HAD OUR THREE DAYS. IT'S TIME THAT WE RETURNED TO A PRE-5 SLS 1 MENTALITY, WHERE ANY  EVENT, NO MATTER HOW MOMENTOUS, IS QUICKLY GROUND INTO FLAVORLESS, COLORLESS PASTE AND SQUEEZED INTO THE CHIRPING  GULLETS OF OUR PUND-OCRACY.
WILL A BIN LADEN BUMP HELP THE PRESIDENT GET REELECTED?
WILL THE PRESIDENT GET A BUMP FROM THE BIN LADEN NEWS?
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT SOME ARE CALLING THIS BIN LADEN BUMP.
Jon: THE BIN LADEN BUMP? YES, YES, AND WOULDN'T IT BE GREATER THAN THE HITLER HIKE. [LAUGHTER] OR EVEN THE FAMED POL POT POP. [LAUGHTER] AND BY THE WAY, I'M SURE THE BIN LADEN BUMP WILL HELP, BUT WHAT  WOULD OBAMA NEED TO REALLY GOOSE HIS NUMBERS?
WE DID AN OVERNIGHT POLL LAST NIGHT. HE'S AT 56% APPROVAL. AGAIN, IT'S NOT THE 80-PLUS PERCENT APPROVAL RATING GEORGE W. BUSH HAD AFTER SEPTEMBER  11th, BUT IT'S CLEARLY HELPING THE PRESIDENT AT THE MARGINS.
ALL JON: SO IT'S GOOD, BUT IT'S NOT 9/11 GOOD. [LAUGHTER] THAT WAS A GREAT TIME TO BE PRESIDENT. OF ONE THING WE CAN BE SURE, THOUGH, ANY SUDDEN DRAMATIC SHIFT BASED ON THE ENORMITY OF THIS EVENT WILL BE PERMANENT.
WILL THE DEATH OF OSAMA BIN LADEN SEAL THE FATE OF OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF?
DID THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT BIN LADEN IS DID CLINCH PRESIDENT OBAMA'S REELECTION?
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SEALED HIS REELECTION IN 2012 WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
Jon: YES, YES, HE SEALED IT. IT'S OVER. THAT'S WHY WE HERE AT "THE DAILY SHOW" ARE TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY  TO LAUNCH "INDECISION 2016. RACE TO THE HOVER HOUSE."  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, 2016, THE WHITE HOUSE WILL BE BUILT USING HOVER TECHNOLOGY. I IMAGINE PRESIDENT-ELECT HILLARY GINGRICH WILL FIND IT TO HER LIKING. OH, THE FUTURE HOLDS MANY SURPRISES. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, FUTURE SURPRISES ALWAYS COME WITH THIS HAND MOVEMENT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW THAT. WHOO, LIKE I'M PETTING A FURRY SNAKE. [GIGGLING] YOU KNOW, THE KEY TO THESE INCREDITBLY ANNOYING ANALYSES IS THE RELUCTANCE WITH WHICH THESE  NEWS PEOPLE DO THEM.
I MEAN, I HATED TO GO POLITICAL IMMEDIATELY ON THIS, BUT DID HE GET A BOUNCE IN HIS APPROVAL RATING?
IS IT TOO EARLY TO START ON THIS CONVERSATION?
I KNOW IT SOUNDS PREMATURE, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE...
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. I HAD ONE PERSON SAY, WHY ARE YOU ASKING THAT QUESTION? I HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT.
I REALLY DID, TOO.
Jon:, YEAH, YEAH, I HEAR A LOT OF THEM TALKING ABOUT IT, TOO, ALTHOUGH A LOT OF THEM SEEM TO BE WEARING MICROPHONES AND PANCAKE MAKE-UP. FOR GOD'S SAKE, AMERICA'S NUMBER-ONE ENEMY IS DEAD. THIS ISN'T A TIME TO ASK WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP. IT'S A TIME TO ASK, IS IT GOOD FOR OUR BUSINESS LEADERSHIP.
HOW DOES THE DEATH OF OSAMA BIN LADEN IMPACT THE BUSINESS LANDSCAPE TODAY?
HOW WILL BIN LADEN'S DEATH AFFECT THE BROADER MARKETS MOVING FORWARD?
WE'LL HIGHLIGHT THREE DEFENSE-RELATED STOCKS POISED TO DO WELL IN THE POST-BIN LADEN ERA.
EVEN THOUGH BIN LADEN DIDN'T PERSONALLY PHYSICALLY HOLD GOLD  HIMSELF, GOLD AS A SAFE HAVEN MIGHT CATCH A... [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I GOT A QUESTION: HOW IS LEAD DOING? WORD IS BIN LADEN IS PHYSICALLY HOLDING SOME OF THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE I'M BEING A LITTLE HARD ON THE NEWS MEDIA. YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO ASK PEOPLE, YOU KNOW WHAT, THEIR OPINIONS ARE.
OUR NEW CNN POLL SHOWS 61% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THE AL QAEDA LEADER IS IN HELL RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO AM I, WOLF, SO AM I. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
