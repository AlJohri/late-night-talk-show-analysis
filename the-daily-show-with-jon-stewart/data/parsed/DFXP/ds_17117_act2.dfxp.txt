(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK! YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK RECENTLY ABOUT BULLYING AND  THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT COMING. (LAUGHTER) BUT THE STRUGGLES OF ONE GROUP OF BULLYING TARGETS HAS NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED: PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. BOTH HAVE HAD CAMPAIGN RALLIES MARRED BY A VARIETY OF HECKLERS.
YOU NEED SOMEBODY... (SHOUTING)
IT WAS NOT... IT'S MY TURN TO SPEAK, YOU'VE HAD YOUR TURN. HOLD ON MY FRIEND.
WE ARE... (SHOUTING) (BOOS)
MITT ROMNEY, YOU'RE A RACIST! MITT ROMNEY, YOU'RE A RACIST! MITT ROMNEY, YOU'RE A RACIST! MITT ROMNEY, YOU'RE A RACIST! MITT ROMNEY, YOU'RE... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: SORRY, THAT WAS... SORRY ABOUT THAT. THAT LAST ONE, THAT WASN'T A HECKLER, THAT'S MY NEW CAR ALARM. (LAUGHTER) THERE'S A LOT I LOVE ABOUT THAT LAST CLIP. HOW IT ONLY SLOWLY DAWNS ON ROMNEY WHAT THAT PERSON IS SAYING BUT MORE THAN THAT IT  NEVER DAWNS ON GIULIANI. (LAUGHTER) HE JUST SIT THERE IS! LOOK AT THAT! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) FREAKY JOKER... IT'S LIKE THE GUY FEEDS OFF HATE LIKE IT'S RED  BULL AND VITAMINS. LIKE, I KNOW EMOTIONS ARE RUNNING HIGH, BUT THIS IS NO WAY FOR A MATURE DEMOCRACY TO  CONDUCT AN ELECTION FOR ITS HIGHEST OFFICE. SURELY THE CAMPAIGNS WILL TAKE SUPPORTERS WILL TAKE STEPS TO STOP SUPPORTERS FROM HECKLING.
OBAMA ADVISOR DAVID AXELROD WENT ON TWITTER TO ASK OBAMA SUPPORTERS TO STOP HECKLING  ROMNEY AND "LET BOTH CANDIDATES SPEAK TO VOTERS CAN DESITE."
REALLY, TWITTER. YES, A CALL FOR CIVILITY AND RESPECT SHOULD BE ON THE INTERNET. I'M SURE THAT WILL BE RESPONDED TO BY "BALLSDEEP 34" AND "  "DR. SUCKIT." (LAUGHTER) I THINK I'M PRONOUNCING THAT NAME RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) BUT AT LEAST THE DEMOCRATS HAVE EXTENDED THE OLIVE BRANCH. REPUBLICANS, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY?
YOU HEARD YOUR PEOPLE... YOU URGED YOUR PEOPLE TO STOP DOING IT TO THE OBAMA PEOPLE?
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: PRESIDENT OBAMA, GOVERNOR ROMNEY, MEET ME AT CAMERA THREE. THAT'S WHAT... NOT YOU! (LAUGHTER) NOT YOU! YOU STAY HERE! (APPLAUSE) LISTEN, ROMNEY AND OBAMA-- AND I USE THIS TERM INACCURATELY, FRIENDS-- LET'S FACE IT, HECKLERS ARE HERE TO STAY AND IT'S UP TO YOU TO LEARN HOW TO RESPOND. LUCKILY DOING STANDUP FOR A BIT OF A WHILE I'M SOMETHING OF AN EXPERT ON THE SUBJECT. WATCH AND LEARN.
LATE SUNDAY IN A JOINT APPEARANCE WITH HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BANER IN TROY, OHIO, PROTESTERS CAME CLOSE TO DROWNING OUT THE CANDIDATE. SHOUTING "GO HOME, ROMNEY."
Jon: "GO HOME, ROMNEY." NOW THIS IS AN EASY ONE. GO HOME? WHICH HOME? THE ONE IN BELMONT? (LAUGHTER) THE ONE IN PARK CITY? THE ONE I (BLEEP) YOUR MOM IN? BOOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BOOM! DOWN GOES HECKLER! NOW, OF COURSE, SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH HECKLERS ONE ON ONE.
IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
(SHOUTING)
EXCUSE ME, SIR, IT'S NOT TIME FOR QUESTIONS, SIR.
(SHOUTING)
NOT WHILE I'M SPEAKING.
Jon: RIGHT THERE. "SIR"? "SIR"? YOU DON'T ADDRESS A HECKLER AS SIR TP-LS IT'S THE BEGINNING OF  "SIR DOUCHE A LOT." SIR TINY (BLEEP) OF THE NUT SACK KINGDOM. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A DIFFERENT SAL YOU STATION INSTEAD OF SIR TRY (BLEEP) (BLEEP) WAD. DR. (BLEEP) WAD. TAINT SWEATINGTON. I REALIZE YOUR SURROGATES ARE ALSO GETTING THE BUSINESS. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO DAVID AXELROD. (SHOUTING)
YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH PHEURBG FRIENDS.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, THEY WEREN'T HECKLING YOU WITH "TELL  ME TRUTH" BUT THAT'S LAME. IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO WITH NICHOLSON SMACKDOWN, GO WITH CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, MY BROTHER.
YOU BALL BUSTING KAS TRADING SON OF A (BLEEP). YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH? THAT'S NOT EVEN THE BEST PUTDOWN FROM "A FEW GOOD MEN."
I'M GOING TO RIP THE EYES OUT OF YOUR HEAD AND PISS IN YOUR DEAD SKULL! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: IF YOU WANT TO GO NICHOLSON YOU COULD FIND BETTER STUFF IN, I DON'T KNOW, EVERY  JACK MOVIE EVER MADE.
DO YOU LIKE TO BE INTERRUPTED WHEN YOU WERE DANCING AROUND IN YOUR LITTLE GARDEN? I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU. I'M JUST GOING TO BASH YOUR BRAINS IN! I AM THE (BLEEP)ING PATROL! SON OF A BITCH. YOU JERK OFF. NASTY LITTLE BITCH. (BLEEP), (BLEEP). (BLEEP), (BLEEP). I SAID OVER EASY! SHUT UP! YOU (BLEEP)ED WITH THE WRONG MARINE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: YEAH! I WOULD GO FOR THAT GUY, AWESOME! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
