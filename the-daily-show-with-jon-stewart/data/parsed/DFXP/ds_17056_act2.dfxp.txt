(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO THIS CONTROVERSY OVER BIRTH CONTROL INSURANCE WAS REALLY IN FULL FLARE LAST WEEK WHICH IS  WHY A CONCERNED SEAN HANNITY CONVENED A DIVERSE PAN PANEL OF EXPERTS. CATHOLIC MEN, JEWISH MEN, BAPTIST MEN, BLACK MEN, WHITE MEN. ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE WHO MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING RELEVANT TO SAY ON WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, WHERE YOU MIGHT SEE A DISAGREEMENT OVER BUREAUCRATIC  DETAILS OF EMPLOYEES' PREVENTATIVE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS, THE WORLD'S HOLIEST  SAUSAGE FEST SAW SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER.
IS THERE A WAR NOW AGAINST... ON RELIGION IN AMERICA, FATHER?
THERE CERTAINLY IS.
Jon: I GOT TO HAND IT TO THESE GUYS ON IMAGINATION. FIRST WINE BECOMES BLOOD THEN INSURANCE REFORM BECOMES WAR. GETTING PRETTY DRAMATIC.
HOW MANY OF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO GO TO JAIL OVER THIS?
IF I'M ASKED TO DO SOMETHING THAT GOES AGAINST MY CONSCIENCE  I BETTER BE WILLING TO DIE FOR THAT. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: THAT STRIKES ME AS SOMETHING OF AN OVERREACTION. I USED TO BAR TEND IN JERSEY, WE HAD SOME HAIR-TRIGGER FOLK THERE IS AS WELL. YOU WANT ANOTHER DRINK? THAT'S IT, OUTSIDE! DO SOME CHRISTIANS FACE PERSECUTION TODAY? ABSOLUTELY. IN EGYPT, CHINA, BELIEVE ME. THE CHRISTIAN GUY MAKING BRICKS IN A CHINESE FORCED LABOR CAMP WOULD LOVE TO BE ON HANNITY  COMPLAINING ABOUT A $20 CO-PAY FOR ORTHO TRISIGH CLEAN. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY EQUATING YOURSELVES WITH VICTIMS OF ACTUAL RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION  IN WARS.
YOU READ ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO AN AMAZINGLY GREAT COUNTRY CALLED GERMANY. IN THE BEBE AGAINING IT ALWAYS STARTS REALLY REALLY SMAR.
HE SAID I DIDN'T SPEAK UP WHEN THEY CAME FOR THE COMMUNISTS BECAUSE I WASN'T A COMMUNIST. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: YOU WANT TO DO THE NAZI DANCE? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO? YOU WANT TO DO THIS? ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST OF ALL, WHEN THE NAZIS CAME FOR PEOPLE, THEY ALSO LEFT WITH THEM. (LAUGHTER) IT WASN'T A METAPHOR. AND AS FOR YOUR SLIPPERY SLOPE, HITLER DID NOT START SMALL. HIS DELIBERATE ANNIHILATION OF A RELIGION DIDN'T KICK OFF WITH "INSURANCE REFORM."  (LAUGHTER) HE STARTED BY TRYING TO TAKE OVER ALL OF GERMANY WITH A MACHINE GUN IN A BEER HALL. THEY SAW HIM COMING. IN JAIL HE AUTHORED A LITTLE BEST-SELLER WRITING "THE PERSONIFICATION OF THE DEVIL AS  THE SYMBOL OF ALL EVIL ASSUMES THE LIVING SHAPE OF THE JEW."  DOESN'T SOUND NEARLY AS BAD IN ITS ORIGINAL ANGRY GERMAN. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S A REAL FONT, BY THE WAY. SO IN THE EARLY 18930s WHEN YOU'RE SAYING HITLER WAS MAKING SUBTLE AND INCREMENTAL CHANGES  AND IT WAS A SLIPPERY SLOPE, HE WAS FOCUSING ON MORE BROAD CHANGES LIKE 192 WHEN A LITTLE  GROUP OF A HALF MILLION BROWN SHIRTS SHOT HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS IN THE STREETS NOT TO  MENTION THOSE INTIMATE LITTLE BACK ROOM GATHERINGINGS THE NAZIS HELD IN NUREMBERG. MY POINT IS, HITLER DIDN'T PLAY SMALL BALL. SO LIGHTEN UP, FRANCIS. AMERICA ISN'T NAZI GERMANY AND THE SECRET POLICE AREN'T COMING FOR YOU. HELL, THE I.R.S. ISN'T EVEN COMING FOR YOU. (LAUGHTER) HIS GOVERNMENT HATES RELIDGES YOU ORGANIZATIONS SO MUCH HE LETS THEM KEEP $100 BILLION A  YEAR IN OFFERINGS TAX FREE. PERSECUTE MY ASS LIKE THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'D LOVE IT. HERE'S HOW FAR YOU ARE FROM BEING PERSECUTED. I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY, THE WORLD CAPITAL OF GODLESS SECULARISM. (LAUGHTER) HOW BAD IS IT? THESE ARE OUR TAXIS. (LAUGHTER) THAT IS WHAT WE HERE IN NEW YORK ARE FORCED TO GO TO WORK IN. (LAUGHTER) BUT EVEN HERE WE'VE CARVED OUT HUGE ZONES IN FRONT OF HOUSES OF  WORSHIP WHERE ONLY RELIGIOUS VEHICLES ARE ALLOWED TO PARK. YOU KNOW HOW HARD IS IT TO FIND A PARKING SPACE IN MANHATTAN? THE ONLY PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD WE ACCEPT IS WHEN YOU FIND A SPOT ON YOUR OWN BLOCK. (LAUGHTER) IT'S THE ONLY PROOF! MEANWHILE... (APPLAUSE) ... RELIGIOUS HOUSES ARE GETTING 50 FEET OF GOLD COAST CURB ALL TO THEMSELVES 24/7. YOU'VE CONFUSED A WAR ON YOUR RELIGION WITH NOT ALWAYS GETTING EVERYTHING YOU WANT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S CALLED BEING PART OF A SOCIETY. NOT EVERYTHING GOES YOUR WAY. YOU KNOW, I DON'T LET MY KIDS EAT ICE CREAM EVERY NIGHT. THEY WISH I DID. BUT EVEN THEY KNOW THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME THE HITLER OF ICE CREAM. (LAUGHTER)
