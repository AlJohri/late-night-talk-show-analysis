(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A JOURNALIST, A DOCUMENTARY FILM MAKER AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST. HE CHRONICLES HIS TIME SPENT AS A PRISONER IN AN IRANIAN JAIL, A FAMILY STORY OF LOVE, CAPTIVE CAPTIVITY AND SURVIVAL. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. MAZIAR BAHARI.
YOU START.
Jon: YOU'RE VERY KIND. ALL RIGHT. NICELY DONE. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M FINE. BUT BEFORE WE START I'D LIKE TO GET SOMETHING OFF MY CHEST. YOU KNOW, LAST TIME I CAME HERE, YOU KNOW, WE WERE JOKING. I SAID THAT YOU GOT ME IN JAIL. IMMEDIATELY I SAID I'M KIDDING.
Jon: YOU DID SAY THAT.
THEN ON BLOGS AND, YOU KNOW, IN PAPERS I SAW THAT PRISON. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MY IMPRISONMENT, MY ARREST. THOSE GUYS, I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE.
Jon: WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE ON THIS SHOW, YOUNG MAN.
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I SHOULD SAY THAT OR NOT.
Jon: THIS IS A VERY CLASSY OPERATION WE RUN.
THOSE GUYS WHO ARRESTED ME, THEY WANTEDED TO FABRICATE CHARGES AGAINST ME.
Jon: RIGHT.
I COULD BE IN SESAME STREET AND THEY WOULD ACCUSE ELMO OF SEDITION.
Jon: YOU HAVE JUST BROKEN A STORY, MY FRIEND. WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, ELMO?
I COULD BE TWO-AND-A-HALF MEN AND THEY COULD ACCUSE ME OF COOPERATING WITH WHAT'S HIS NAME? CHARLIE SHEEN.
Jon: EXACTLY.
AND CORRUPTING THE EARTH.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. I FEEL MUCH BETTER. HE'S REFERRING TO WHEN HE WAS IN IRAN, WE SENT JASON JONES THERE. HE INTERVIEW MAZIAR BAHARI IN A CAFE AND JASON PRETENDED TO BE SPY. WHILE YOU WERE IN PRISON THEY SHOWED A TAPE OF THAT TO YOU AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING TO A SPY?
BECAUSE JASON LOOKED LIKE A SPY. ACTED LIKE A SPY.
Jon: RIGHT.
I GUESS HE TASTED LIKE A SPY. TO THEY SAY HE'S A SPY.
Jon: THE THING IS THEY PROBABLY NEVER EXPLAINED IS WHY WOULD A SPY DO THAT ON TELEVISION?
AND WHY THERE ARE LAUGH TRACKS.
Jon: THE LAUGHTER IS REAL. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  LET ME ASK YOU, FIRST OF ALL, THIS REALLY IS IS AN INCREDIBLE STORY. I WANT TO SHOW THIS RIGHT HERE. THEN THEY CAME FOR ME. A FAMILY STORY. WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS IS YOUR FATHER IN THE 1950s WAS ARRESTED BY THE SHAW'S PEOPLE  BECAUSE HE BELONGED TO WHAT WAS CALLED THE TUDA PARTY.
THE COMMUNIST PARTY.
Jon: YOUR SISTER WAS ARRESTED....
IN THE 1980s.
Jon: IN THE 1980s UNDER KHOMEINI. THE SAME THING. YOUR FAMILY HAS FACED THIS HISTORY. HOW DOES A FAMILY STAY AT A CERTAIN POINT IN THE COUNTRY AND PUT UP WITH THAT SORT OF  SWORD HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS ALL THE TIME?
THE STORY OF MY FAMILY IS VERY TYPICAL OF MANY IRANIAN FAMILIES. MANY IRANIAN FAMILIES WENT THROUGH EVEN WORSE STORIES THAN MY FAMILY. MY FATHER AND MY SISTER, THEY BOTH BELIEVED IN AN IDEAL. THEY WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE. THEY WANTED A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEIR COUNTRY. AND THEY FOUGHT FOR THAT. THEY HAD TO PAY FOR IT.
Jon: BOTH TORTURED ALSO IN PRISON.
YES. MY FATHER WAS TORTURED BY THE SHAH'S REGIME. HE SPENT FOUR YEARS IN SHAH'S PRISONS. HIS TOENAILS WERE DAMAGED. HE COULDN'T WALK PROPERLY. MY SISTER SPENT SIX YEARS IN THE '80s IN KHOMEINI'S REGIME. SHE HAD MOCK EXECUTION AND WENT THROUGH TORTURE. THIS IS A TYPICAL IRANIAN FAMILY STORY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY NEVER GAVE UP HOPE  ABOUT THE FUTURE OF IRAN. AND THE FUTURE... THE FUTURE OF A BETTER IRAN. THEY ALWAYS FOUGHT FOR A BETTER IRAN. THEY INSPIREDED ME. WHILE I WAS IN PRISON WHEN THEY ARRESTED ME IN 2009, WHEN I WAS IN PRISON I WAS INSPIRED  BY THE MEMORY OF MY FAMILY. BY THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER AND MY SISTER.
Jon: YOU WRITE ABOUT ALSO FEELING THE PRESSURE TO LIVE UP TO THEM BECAUSE THEY HAD  BEEN SO BRAVE. DID THAT WEIGH ON YOU OR DID THAT ALSO GIVE YOU STRENGTH?
IT BOTH... IT WAS... IT GAVE ME A STRENGTH BECAUSE I TALKED A LOT TO MY FATHER AND  MY SISTER ABOUT THEIR TIME IN PRISON. WHEN I CAME OUT OF PRISON A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKED ME HOW COME YOU'RE RELATIVELY UNSCATHED? YOU LOOK AT THIS UNSCATHED. THAT WAS MAINLY BECAUSE OF MY IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH MY FATHER AND MY SISTER. AND BECAUSE THEIR MEMORIES, THEIR LOVE, IT GAVE ME INSPIRATION. YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN A SPIRITUAL PERSON. YOU KNOW, I NEVER WATCHED OPRAH, YOU KNOW, LIKE THAT.
Jon: DID NOT THINK YOU WERE GOING THERE. (LAUGHING)
BUT WHEN I WAS IN PRISON, YOU KNOW, I SPENT 107 DAYS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT I HAD TO TAP INSIDE MY INNER RESOURCES. MY INNER RESOURCES WERE MY MEMORIES OF MY FAMILY, MY FATHER, SISTER, AND ALSO THE  BIGGER MEMORIES OF CULTURE, HISTORY, MUSIC WHICH I EXPLAIN IN THE BOOK. THAT WAS, TO ME, IT WAS A VERY SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE.
Jon: RIGHT.
EVEN THOUGH I NEVER JOINED A CULT.
Jon: IF ONLY THEY HAD GOTTEN YOU AT THE RIGHT TIME.
EXACTLY.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT'S SO, I THINK, INCREDIBLE ABOUT THIS BOOK. THIS IS NOT TO MINIMIZE OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES BECAUSE I'VE READ, THERE HAVE BEEN  SOME MEMOIRS OF JOURNALISTS OR OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED IN TOTALITARIAN  REGIMES AND OTHER PLACES. YOUR ABILITY TO CONNECT IT TO YOUR FAMILY AND JUST THE NUANCES OF WHAT YOU PICK UP  EVEN FROM YOUR CAPTORS. YOU KNOW, YOU TALK ABOUT THIS FELLOW ROSEWATER THAT WAS YOUR INTERROGATOR AND YOUR TORTURER. HIS FATHER HAD ALSO BEEN IN PRISON. IT'S SUCH AN INTERESTING SYNCHRONICITY THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO REMEMBER. HOW DID YOU KEEP THESE THINGS IN YOUR MIND TO BE ABLE TO CHRONICLE THEM?
THE THING IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE, YOU HAVE TO CREATE AN INNER UNIVERSE FOR YOURSELF. YOU HAVE TO SHIELD YOURSELF INSIDE. SO YOU HAVE THE PHYSICAL PRESSURE AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE YOU THAT YOU KEEP INTACT. WHEN SOMEONE IS CHARGING YOU WITH SUCH EXAGGERATED ACCUSATIONS LIKE, YOU KNOW, MOST OF YOUR AUDIENCE DON'T KNOW....
Jon: WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A COMMERCIAL. BEFORE WE GO, I DO WANT TO SAY IN THE SPIRIT OF FULL DISCLOSURE. THIS IS HOW IMPRESSED I AM WITH THIS MAN'S STORY AND HIS COURAGE IN THIS BOOK. YOU AND I ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON A FILM ABOUT THIS. THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE AND I'VE SUGGESTED OBVIOUSLY MATT DAMON AS YOU. AGAIN, IT'S UP TO YOU. THE CASTING WILL BE UP TO YOU.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT WILL SMITH.
Jon: ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. THE REST OF THIS WE'LL PUT UP ON THE WEBB. MAZIAR BAHARI. TAKE A LOOK AT THE
