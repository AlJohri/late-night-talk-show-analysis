Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SHE'S THE FIRST LADY OF UNITED STATES. SHE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK CALLED "AMERICAN GROWN:  THE STORY OF THE WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN GUARD  AND GARDENS ACROSS AMERICA." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.
IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE. GOOD TO BE BACK.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THIS IS MY BOOK.
Jon: IT'S CALLED "AMERICAN GROWN." YOU AS FIRST LADY, EVERYBODY HAS  AN ISSUE. YOU DECIDED I'M GOING TO TAKE ON THIS IDEA OF GETTING CHILDREN TO EAT WELL.
YES.
Jon: WOULDN'T YOU HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL WITH LET'S SAY COLONIZATION OF MARS? LAFER LAUGH AS A PARENT OF TWO CHILDREN, UNLESS THIS GARDEN SPROUTS CHEESEBURGERS, NO. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW -- WHAT GAVE YOU THE IDEA TO DO THIS? IT WAS REALLY MY EXPERIENCE AS A MOTHER TRYING TO GET MY KIDS TO EAT WELL. YOU KNOW WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WE'RE SEEING AN EPIDEMIC OF CHILDHOOD OBESITY. ONE IN THREE OF OUR KIDS WILL BE OVER WEIGHT OR OBESE AND WE'RE  SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR PREVENTABLE ILLNESSES. IN MY LIFE, I SAW HOW THAT WAS HAPPENING. TWO BUSY PARENTS, DON'T HAVE TIME TO COOK. EATING OUT TOO MUCH. ACTIVITY IS BEING ELIMINATED FROM OUR SCHOOLS IN MANY WAYS. THE AVERAGE KID IS SPENDING 7.5 HOURS A DAY IN FRONT OF A SCREEN. THE AVERAGE KID. THAT'S ON AVERAGE.
Jon: CAN I JUST VERY QUICKLY -- KIDS, IF YOU ARE AT HOME RIGHT NOW --  [ LAUGHTER ] DADDY SAYS YOU CAN BEAT THAT. DADDY KNOWS YOU ARE NOT AVERAGE, KIDS. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO SEE TEN HOURS FROM YOU TODAY. MY KIDS CAN MAKE THIS.
NO!
Jon: DID I GET THAT WRONG?
NO, NO, GO THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
Jon: WE USED TO -- IN THE OLD DAYS THEY OPENED THE BACK DOOR, YOU WENT OUT AND YOU RAN. BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT WORLD.
IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD, YEAH. WITH MODERN LIFE THINS ARE CHANGING. MANY KIDS ARE LIVING IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEIR PARENTS DON'T FEEL SAFE HAVING THEM RUN  OUTSIDE, RIGHT?
Jon: RIGHT.
FAST FOOD IS THE EXCEPTION -- THE RULE RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION. JUST CULTURALLY.
Jon: IT'S CHEAPER SHOW. TRYING TO FEED POWER TO PEOPLE A DOLLAR MENU WITH GOOD FOOD ON IT. IS THIS FOR YOU MORE OF A SYMBOLIC IDEA THAT THEY START TO UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND?
THE GARDEN IS THE WAY TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION. I LEARNED IN CHANGING MY KIDS HABITS, IF THEY ARE INVOLVED IN THE GROWING PROCESS OF FOOD AND  THEY GET A SENSE OF WHERE IT COMES FROM AND THEY ARE ENGAGED, THEY TEND TO BE EXCITED ABOUT IT. THE GARDEN IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CATALYST FOR THAT DISCUSSION. WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS OF KIDS WORKING WITH US IN THE GUARD TON HELP PLANT AND HARVEST. USUALLY WITH THE HARVEST WE END WITH A VEGETABLE FEAST. WE'VE GOT KIDS WHO --
Jon: THE PHRASE VEGETABLE FEAST --
IT'S A FEAST!
Jon: IS THERE A CHEESE FAUCET FOR THIS VEGETABLE FEAST?
WE'VE SERVED EVERYTHING FROM FLAT BREAD VEGGIE PIZZA THAT  MANY KIDS SAID IS BETTER THAN TAKEOUT. BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THAT VEGETABLES GROWN FRESH TASTE BETTER. I KNOW YOU GOT THOSE STORE BOUGHT TOMATOES IN THE PLASTIC TIN THAT TASTED LIKE WATER.
Jon: OR THE BOIL IN THE BAG IN THE CRAZY YELLOW SAUCE THAT SHE SAID IS SAY BUTTERRISH SUBSTANCE.
YOU COOKED BROCCOLI UNTIL YOU COULD CUT WIT A FORK. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY. WHEN YOU GET KIDS ENGAGED IN PULLING A TOMATO OFF THE VINE.
Jon: ENGAGE YOUR CHILDREN.
IN THE PROCESS.
Jon: TALK TO THEM. DO NOT LEAVE THEM OUTSIDE. CAN YOU STICK AROUND? GO TO COMMERCIAL AND WE'LL COME BACK FOR MORE.
YES.
Jo
