Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE ANCHOR OF FOX BUSINESS NETWORK'S FREEDOM WATCH AS WELL AS THE  SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST FOR FOX NEWS CHANNEL. HIS BOOK IS CALLED IT'S DANGEROUS TO BE RIGHT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS WRONG. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO. SIR? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT IS UP? HOW ARE YOU?
GREAT, HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW? YOU'VE GOT THIS REPUBLICAN NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY --
I THINK IT'S GOING ON AS WE SPEAK.
Jon: YOU JUST TOLD PEOPLE THAT WE TAPED IT EARLIER.
BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE RESULTS THERE'S NO TIME MACHINE.
Jon: DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MAGIC WHEN IT DISAPPEARS? [ LAUGHTER ]
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN!
Jon: JUDGE, LET ME ASK YOU THIS:  EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE LINING UP. THE REPUBLICANS DON'T SEEM TO WANT MITT ROMNEY. THEY DON'T SEEM TO LIKE MITT ROMNEY EVEN THOUGH HE HAS BEEN DESIGNED IN A PRESIDENTIAL LAB  BENEATH A VOLCANO WITH LIKE A SKULL HEAD.
HE DOES HAVE THAT LOOK. BUT WHAT DOES HE STAND FOR THAT IS PARTICULARLY REPUBLICAN? HE LIKES BIG GOVERNMENT, TARP, BAILING OUT THE BANKS, BAILING OUT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, FIGHTING WARS OF OPPORTUNITY.
Jon: I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOUR THING.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS -- THAT WAS GEORGE W. BUSH WHICH THE COUNTRY JOSH BECKETTED.
Jon: THE REPUBLICANS -- COUNTRY JOSH JOSH REJECTED.
Jon: THE REPUBLICANS DIDN'T. THEY ALMOST RENOUNCED THEIR FORMER BASICALLY PRESIDENTS. REAGAN SAID HE WOULD LOWER -- YOU KNOW MAKE GOVERNMENT SMALLER. IT GOT BIGGER. IT HAS SINCE GREW.
YES.
Jon: GEORGE H.W. RAISED TAXES. GEORGE W. BUSH HAD WARS.
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE CHANGED IN THE LAST 48 HOURS WHEN THEY  ATTACKED MITT ROMNEY FOR MAKING MONEY AND HIRING PEOPLE.
Jon: WASN'T THAT THE CRAZIEST THING. NEWT GINGRICH IS THE OCCUPY WALL STREET CANDIDATE.
EXACTLY.
Jon: WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
GINGRICH IS A LONG HAIRED LEFTY EVER SINCE HE HEARD THE ERA OF BIG GOVERNMENT IS OVER  AND HE BELIEVED IT. THERE'S ONLY ONE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WHO WON'T GO TO WAR. WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IT'S THE JOB OF PRESIDENT TO RUN THE ECONOMY  OR TO BE THE POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD OR TOMORROW YOU HOW TO LIVE --
Jon: ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT TAFT? TAFT?
THE GUY YOU ADMIRE MOST.
Jon: IN THE REPUBLICAN FIELD.
RON PAUL.
Jon: I HAPPEN TO THINK HE IS A STRAIGHT SHOOTER. WHAT KIND OF RIDICULOUS CLICHE IS THAT?
HE BELIEVES IN SMALL GOVERNMENT.
Jon: THE NEWS LETTER THING BOTHERED ME. BUT HIS ANSWERS TO IT STRUCK ME AS HE SUDDENLY BECAME A POLITICIAN. I DON'T KNOW WHO -- OF THE HE WENT TO JACKIE MASON.
HE SHOULD HAVE SAID, LOOK, THAT WAS THEN THIS IS NOW. I CONDEMN IT NOW. I SHOULD HAVE CONDEMNED IT THEN. HE DID EVENTUALLY. THE EMPHASIS IS BACK MORE ON THE ISSUES AREN'T THE PEOPLE ENTITLED TO A GOVERNMENT THAT  STAYS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF CONSTITUTION? WHO IS THE GOVERNMENT TO TELL US WHAT TO DO IN THE BEDROOMS OR BASEMENTS OF OUR HOMES?
Jon: WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE? HERE IS THE THING:  THE REPUBLICANS VERY MUCH ARE -- HERE IS THE THING I DON'T  UNDERSTAND ABOUT -- MAYBE YOU TELL ME THISCY LIBERTARIAN VIEWPOINT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT INFRINGE ON YOUR FREEDOMS BUT IF THE STATES DO IT IT'S OKAY.
THERE ARE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WHO AGREE WITH YOU AND THEY ARE WRONG BECAUSE THE  14th AMENDMENT WITHOUT GETTING TOO HISTORICAL APPLIES THE BILL OF RIGHTS TO THE STATES. WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO WITH SPEECH OR PRIVACY OR RELIGION OR TRAVEL THE STATES  CAN'T INTERFERE WITH IT EITHER. THAT'S THE LESSON OF CIVIL WAR. IT'S BEEN THE LAW OF THE LAND FOR THE PAST 125 YEARS. NOT ALL REPUBLICANS ACCEPT THAT. AM I GETTING A PAYCHECK NEXT WEEK.
Jon: PROBABLY NOT RIGHT NOW. UNDER THE CHAIR IS LIKE THE ROGER ALES TINGLER.
HE WAS A GREAT MAN WHO HAS A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR THE HOST.
Jon: FOR YOU?
FOR YOU. HE PROBABLY TOLD YOU ABOUT HIMSELF.
Jon: SOMETIMES AT NIGHT WHEN I LOOK OUT THE WINDOW I SEE HIM STANDING THERE UNDERNEATH  THE TREE IN THE RAIN WITH AN UMBRELLA.
PROTECTING YOUR FREEDOM.
Jon: THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT HE IS DOING. THERE'S A COGNITIVE DISNANCE IN THE PARTY ATTACK MITT ROMNEY FOR BEING THE AVATAR AND THEN  THERE'S GUYING TALKING ABOUT FREEDOM AND SUGGESTING GAY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE SAME  RIGHTS AS EVERY OTHER AMERICAN. HOW IS THAT GOING TO PLAY ITSELF OUT?
FIVE OF THOSE SIX CANDIDATES ARE REPUGNANT TO FREEDOM. THEY DON'T BELIEVE RIGHTS COME FROM HUMANITY. THEY JUST BELIEVE IN A REPUBLICAN OF BIG GO. I'M NOT HERE REAPING RON PAUL. HE'S MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE BUT ONLY HE BELIEVES THE FREEDOMS COME FROM THE HUMANITY AND NOT  THE GOVERNMENT.
Jon: IS HE A REPUBLICAN? IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE HE IS AT ODDS WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE MAINSTREAM BELIEVES MORE IN BIG GOVERNMENT.
YOU ARE EXACTLY CORRECT. HIS GOAL IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS TO EDUCATE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND BRING IT BACK TO ITS SMALL  GOVERNMENT ROOTS. HE HAS HAD A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUCCESS. HE'S BEEN DOING IT 25-30 YEARS.
Jon: GETTING IT INTO THE CONVERSATION. I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I FEEL THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PARTY IS DISRESPECTFUL TO HIM.
BECAUSE THEY LIKE THEIR VERSION OF BIG GOVERNMENT. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S TWO PARTIES.
Jon: DON'T LOOK AT THEM --
JACKSON, REMEMBER HIM?
Jon: WHENEVER YOU TURN AND LOOK OUT I'M LIKE OH, (bleep) SOMETHING BAD IS ABOUT TO  HAPPENED HE'S GOING THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED --
WE HAVE ONE BIG GOVERNMENT PARTY. IT HAS A DEMOCRATIC WING THAT LIKES WAR AND TAXES AND INDIVIDUAL WELFARE AND A  REPUBLICAN WING THAT LIKES WAR AND DEFICITS AND CORPORATE WELFARE. ONLY SOMEBODY LIKE RON PAUL BELIEVES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD LEAVE YOU ALONE, TAX YOU  MINIMALLY AND THAT GOVERNMENT IS BEST WHICH GOVERNS LEAST. YOU BELIEVE THAT, JON STEWART, DON'T YOU.
Jon: YOU DON'T KNOW I BELIEVE IT BUT NOW THAT YOU SAY IT I WEIRDLY WANT TO HUG YOU. FREEDOM WATCH. IT'S THE JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
