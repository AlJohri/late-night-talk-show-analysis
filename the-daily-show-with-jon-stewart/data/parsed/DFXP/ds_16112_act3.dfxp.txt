[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS CNN'S SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT. HIS NEW SPECIAL IS CALLED DR. SANJAY GUPTA REPORTS: TERROR IN THE DUST.
WE HAVE FIRE, PLASTICS, OTHER PARTS OF THE PERIODIC TABLE.
GOLD AND MERCURY FROM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FLORESCENT LIGHTBULBS, BAD -- LEAD FROM  THOUSANDS OF COMPUTER MONITOR, TITANIUM FROM PAINT ON THE TRADE CENTER WALLS, ASBESTOS THAT COATED LOWER BEAMS OF THE TRADE  CENTER BUILDINGS. THERE WAS CEMENT, GLASS, CARPET FIBERS, CEILING TILES, EVEN HUMAN HAIR. IN ALL 1.5 MILLION TONS OF THE STUFF.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW DR. SANJAY GROUP TA. -- GROUP -- GUPTA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SO IN THE SWIRL OF OBVIOUSLY ALL THESE REMEMBRANCES AND THE TEN-YEAR, THIS REALLY IS AN  ONGOING ISSUE, WHICH IS THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE THAT WENT DOWN TO THE POD, AND THAT'S WHAT  THIS SPECIAL IS EXPLORING.
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A HUGELY, SURPRISINGLY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. PEOPLE HAVE SUSPECTED FOR SOME TIME THAT THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THIS DUST AND THE CANCER  THAT PEOPLE ARE SEEING. HIGHER RATES OF CANCER. PEOPLE NOTICE THIS PRETTY QUICKLY. THE QUESTION HAS BEEN, PEOPLE HAVE SAID, IS THIS EMOTION OR IS THIS SCIENCE? AND NOW AT THE TEN-YEAR MARK WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SCIENTIFIC PAPERS COME OUT AND ADDRESS THIS.
Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK WE COULDN'T HAVE GIVEN THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND ERRED  ON THE SIDE OF MAYBE SPENDING A YEAR ON A SMOLDERING PILE MIGHT NOT BE GOOD FOR YOU?
I MEAN, YOU MAY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BETTER THAN I. YOU'VE TALKED A LOT TO PEOPLE ABOUT. THIS I DON'T KNOW, JON. I THINK PART OF THAT IS JUST PERSONALITY. PART OF THAT IS OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS OTHER PEOPLE. PART OF IT IS ARE WE GOING TO BE COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE WHO AIR ON THE SIDE OF, OKAY, SO WE TOOK  CARE OF AN EXTRA GUY WHO GOT CANCER THAT WASN'T RELATED TO 9/11 BUT TOOK CARE OF HUNDREDS  OF PEOPLE WHO DID, OR ARE WE GOING TO DO NOTHING AT ALL? I THINK THAT'S JUST... THE AMAZING THING IS YOU TALK TO THESE FIRST RESPONDERS, AND THEY  REAFFIRM MY FAITH BECAUSE OF ALL THAT MAKES ME... IT SORT OF CHALLENGES YOU FAITH. THEN YOU TALK TO THESE GUYS AND THEY'RE LITERALLY ON OXYGEN. THEY'RE ON THEIR DEATH BEDS. THAT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION. THEY SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, IF THERE WAS AN ATTACK TOMORROW, I'D BE OUT THERE AGAIN. AND THERE'S NOTHING FALSE ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.
Jon: IT'S IN THEIR D.N.A. I TRULY BELIEVE IT'S IN THEIR D.N.A. THE QUESTION BECOMES: LET'S NOT BE INSANE HERE. A SMOLDERING PILE OF ANYTHING, A SMOLDERING PILE OF BROCCOLI...
CAN'T BE GOOD FOR YOU.
Jon: NOTHING SMOLDERING IS GOOD FOR YOU. AND THESE GUYS WERE DOWN THERE DAY IN AND DAY OUT WITH THE TYPE OF PAPER MASKS A JAPANESE  BUSINESSMAN WITH A HEAD COLD WEARS WHEN HE'S GOING DOWN THE  STREET INCH GOD'S NAME NEW YORK WHAT WORLD WOULD THAT NOT CAUSE  THESE BRAVE INDIVIDUALS DISEASE?
I COMPLETELY AGREE. IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE WE KNOW AS YOU SAW, ALL THE COMPONENTS OF THIS DUST NOW, THAT'S BEEN STUDIED. WE KNOW THAT SO MANY OF THOSE THINGS, THEY CAUSE CANCER, THEY'RE CARCINOGENIC. WHAT WAS AMAZING IS YOU GOT THIS WHOLLY UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE ALL THESE CHEMICALS WERE THRUST  TOGETHER AT THE TIME OF THESE ATTACKS, SO BENZENE WITH VARIOUS OTHER COMPOUNDS, TITANIUM. WE KNOW THOSE THINGS INDIVIDUALLY CAN CAUSE CANCER AND IN COMBINATION COULD BE EVEN WORSE. WHAT I THINK SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY IS, LOOK, CANCER CAN TAKE A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP. IT CAN TAKE 15, 20, 30 YEARS. SO WE'RE IN THE SEEING THE BIG CANCER RATES THAT WE THOUGHT YET. WE THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING IT AS OF YET.
Jon: THEY'RE COVERING THINGS LIKE SCIATIC AND, YOU KNOW...
CARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROME.
BUT NOT CANCER. THEY SAY THE SCIENCE IS NOT THERE, BUT THE SCIENCE OF CANCER, WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT  CAUSES MOST CANCERS.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: IF THEIR LEVEL OF PROOF, THE BAR OF PROOF IS THEY HAVE TO FIND A PERFECT  CAUSALITY, NOT EVEN A CORRELATION, WILL THESE GUYS EVER GET THE SATISFACTION AND  COVERAGE THEY NEED?
IT IS AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BAR TO MEET. I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO DRAW A CORRELATION BETWEEN SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER. THERE WAS A SHOW ON YOUR PIECE ON ASBESTOS. THAT TOOK 25 YEARS THE DRAW THE LINK BETWEEN ASBESTOS AND MESOTHELIOMA. PEOPLE DIED WHO MAY HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN SCREENED AND TREATED AND SAVED. IF YOU WAIT FOR THE SCIENCE TO CATCH UP, WHICH IT MAY NEVER, AS  YOU'RE SAYING, YOU'VE WAITED TOO LONG.
Jon: HAVE YOU BEEN SURPRISED BY THE... THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MORE STUNNING  EXAMPLES OF PUSHBACK THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN FROM A COMMUNITY. IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY, BUT THE GOVERNMENT PUSHING BACK ON THESE GUYS TO  KEEP MAKING IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET HELP AND TREATMENT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. I MEAN, AND YOU KNOW, YOU SEE ADS AND FOR CAMPAIGNS, WHENEVER SOMEONE IS RUNNING FOR OFFICE, THEY INVOKE THE FIRST RESPONDERS, YOU HAVE PICTURES OF THEM. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW AGAIN YOU WOULDN'T ERR ON THE SIDE OF TAKING CARE OF THESE FOLKS.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE THING IS IT'S NOT JUST TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK RIGHT NOW. IF THEY ALLOW THIS SCIENCE TOE MERGE AND PEOPLE START TO UNDERSTAND, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO  COULD BE SAVED. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL GET SCREENED KNOWING THAT WHAT THEY WERE BREATHING IN COULD BE PROBLEMATIC.
Jon: THE SPECIAL YOU'RE DOING IS BASED ON SCIENCE, NOT EMOTION. THE GENTLEMAN YOU HAVE IN THE SHOW...
THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE HE SAID THAT EXACT THING. HE SAID, PEOPLE HAVE SAID DON'T LET EMOTIONS CLOUD SCIENCE. THEY SAID, HERE'S THE SCIENCE. I GOT IT FOR YOU NOW.
Jon: SO THIS GUY HAS THE SCIENCE NOW. WILL THEY REVISIT THE RULING THAT THEY WON'T COVER CANCER?
THEY SAID THEY KNOW ABOUT THE STUDY. TECHNICALLY THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE VISIT THIS UNTIL JULY OF 2012. THERE WAS A PETITION SIGNED TODAY BY PEOPLE WHO INTRODUCED THE ZADROGA BILL IN THE FIRST  PLACE WHO SAID THIS SCIENCE IS COMPELLING. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS, TRYING TO DO SOMETHING.
Jon: SO THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR BEFORE, AND  SICK INDIVIDUALS?
THEY'RE IN THIS DOCUMENTARY. THIS GUY MARTY FULHAM, WHO MAYBE IS WATCHING RIGHT NOW, BUT HE'S  LITERALLY... HE'S BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME. AND, YOU KNOW, I HATE SAYING THIS, BUT IT MAY NOT COME IN TIME FOR HIM. BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED, MATE NOW HAPPEN FAST ENOUGH. IT SHOULD FOR PEOPLE LIKE HIM.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE A FEAR THIS GETS BURIED IN ANOTHER BUREAUCRATIC JUMBLE OR IT'S A  HOT BUTTON ENOUGH ISSUE AROUND THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY THAT PEOPLE WILL TAKE UP THE MANTLE?
I THINK PEOPLE WILL TAKE UP THE MANTLE. I BELIEVE THAT. I THINK THAT THIS IS A TIME WHERE PEOPLE DO REFLECT. THEY LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THE HEROES ON THAT DAY, NOT A TERM IN ANY WAY USED LYINGLY BUT  GENUINELY, AND I HOPE THEY DO.
Jon: RIGHT. IT'S FREAKY THAT THESE ANNIVERSARIES ARE ARBITRARY AND LORD KNOWS WE'RE EXCESSIVE IN  OUR COVERAGE AND REMEMBRANCE OF IT. IT'S SO SHOCKING THAT IN ACTUALITY THE HELP YOU NEED STILL DOESN'T COME.
I HAVE TO SAY, JON, YOU'VE DONE A LOT ON THIS ISSUE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A YEAR. YOUR NAME WAS BROUGHT UP SO MANY TIMES BY THESE FIRST RESPONDERS.
Jon: LISTEN, IF THAT'S WHAT GOES ON THE GRAVESTONE AS IN YOUR TIME HERE YOU HELPED  INCREMELY THESE PEOPLE...
YOU'LL TAKE IT.
Jon: I'LL TAKE IT. THAT WILL BE FINE. "TERROR IN THE DUST." IT'S ACTUALLY ON RIGHT NOW. TRUTH OF THE MATTER, THIS WHOLE TIME, NOBODY'S BEEN WATCHING. IT'S A GREAT SPECIAL AND REALLY WONDERFUL WORK. NICE JOB. "TERROR IN THE DUST." REPLAYS ON SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 10th. 9:00 P.M. DR. SANJAY GROUP TAMP NICE JOB.
