AUGUST 11th, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT A MAN NAME MICHAEL WALLIS, AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK CALLED DAVID  CROCKETT, THAT'S RIGHT, DAVID. (LAUGHTER)
WHAT MR. CROCKETT PREFERRED AND ACTUALLY HE DIDN'T WEAR A RACOON TAILED  HAT, HE WORE A CA RON PELT CHAPPEAU. THEY GAVE ME THE SEN TEN-- SENTENCED UTTERED EVERY FOUR YEARS. OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT IS IN A MARK ES, EYE WATCH. THE IOWA STRAW POLL WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF INDECISION 2012, CORN POLL EDITION. THE IOWA STRAW POLL IS, OF COURSE, THE EARLY AUGUST TO THE VERY PREDICTIVE  PRECURSOR TO JANUARY'S WILDLY NONPREDICTIVE IOWA CAUCUS. (LAUGHTER) THE IDEA IS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SET UP TENTS. IN THOSE TENTS THE CANDIDATE OFFERS TO PAY AN INDIVIDUAL $30 STRAW POLL ENTRANCE FEE. IN RETURN, THE INDIVIDUAL PROMISES TO CAST THEIR VOTE FOR SAID CANDIDATE ALL WHILE  BOTH PARTIES PRETEND THIS CORRUPT TRANSACTION IN NO WAY AFFECTS EITHER PARTY'S  INHERENT HEARTLAND FOXINESS. IT'S JUST GOOD OLD PARKED DOWN HOME COUNTRY VOTE BUYING. (LAUGHTER) ALL THE FUN OF A POLL TAX WITH NONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES. (LAUGHTER)
SO CLEARLY THE KEY TO INING WITH THE IOWA STRAW POLL IS NOT SOME OF HAVING  THE BEST PLATFORM AND MESSAGE BUT THE MOST KICK-ASS TENT. AND DARE I SAY NO ONE CAN PITCH A TENT--  (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LIKE MICHELE BACHMANN.
COME FROM 9 TO 5, WE HAVE AN AIR CONDITIONED TENT. WE'VE GOT CHAIRS. WE'VE GOT LIVE, WE'VE GOT COUNTRY LEGEND SUPERSTAR RANDY TRAVIS LIVE. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE A PETTING ZOO FOR THE KIDS AND FOOD. I MEAN IT IS FUN AND ENTERTAINMENT.
THE RANDY TRAVIS THING IS UNDER BELIEVABLE. YOU HAVE RANDY TRAVIS, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GAVE RANDY TRAVIS SECOND BILLING TO CHAIRS. WE GOT CHAIRS AND RANDY TRAVIS. (LAUGHTER) SO THE PIMPED OUT TENT-BIDDING STANDS AT CHAIRS, PETTING ZOO AND RANDY TRAVIS. WHO CAN TOP IT.
I WILL SAY THAT TIM PAWLENTY HAS MIKE HUCKABEE PERFORMING IN A STRAW POLL CONCERT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO NOBODY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOBODY'S GOT ANYTHING ELSE. LOOK, HUCK A KBEE, MUSIC FROM HUCKABEE BUT IT'S NOT A GREAT SIGN FOR YOU WHEN YOUR  MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT COULD PROBABLY DO BETTER THAN YOU IN THE STRAW POLL IN IOWA. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO HUCKABEE HAS THE CONSTITUENCY AND IF HE'S THROWING HIS FULL SUPPORT  BEHIND PAWLENTY, THAT IS MEANINGFUL.
FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE IS GOING TO JOIN GOSPEL SINGER AND  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HERMAN CAIN ON STAGE AT THE IOWA STRAW POLL IN AMES THIS WEEKEND. WHAT? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HUCKABEE YOU DOUBLE BOOKED THE AMES IOWA STRAW POLL? FOR RICK SANTORUM WILL BE THERE. HIS TENT BOASTS RICK SANTORUM SUMMER DANCE PARTY WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS THE LOWEST TESTING BET PILOT EVER. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HI, EVERYBODY, WHO HERE LIKES TO CHA-CHA. REMEMBER LEAVE ROOM FOR JESUS. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, IF SUMMER DANCE PARTIES ARE NOT YOUR THING, PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE SOME OF RICK SANTORUM'S HOMEMADE PEACH JELLY. THEY'RE HANDING OUT SAMPLES OF THEIR PEACH JELLY. WOW. RICK SANTORUM MUST REALLY BE TRYING TO CHANGE THE SEARCH RESULTS THAT COME UP WHEN  PEOPLE GOOGLE SANTORUM AND JELLY. NOW RICK--  (APPLAUSE) RICK, IT'S THE AMES STRAW POLL. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TENT. PLEASE TELL ME YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT'S GOING TO BRING PEOPLE TO YOUR TENT.
HOW ABOUT MIKE HUCKABEE, REMEMBER HIM THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS, WILL ALSO GOING TO PERFORM AT  RICK SANTORUM'S TENT. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MIKE HUCK A BEE, I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THIS TO YOU, YOU ARE A SHUT. (LAUGHTER) -- SLUT. SO WHETHER THE STRAW POLL IS PREDICTIVE OR NOT, THE MEDIA EYES OF THE COUNTRY WILL BE  FOCUSED ON AMES, IOWA THIS WEEKEND, WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING.
PACK IT IN, BOYS. JUST THIS MORNING WE'VE LEARNED THAT SARAH PALIN IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE IN IOWA TODAY.
Jon: YUP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR SARAH PALIN'S PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT SUSPENDED  GREYHOUND OF FREEDOM TOUR HAS MIRACULOUSLY RECONSTITUTED IN THE HAWKEYE STATE THIS WEEKEND. WHY?
SARAH PALIN IS NOT ON THE BALLOT IN THE IOWA STRAW POLL. SHE'S NOT A DECLARED CONDITION DATA FOR PRESIDENT. BUT GUESS WHAT, SHE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT SHE IS TAKING HER ONE NATION BUS TOUR HERE TO IOWA. THAT IS RIGHT. SHE WANTS TO BE PART OF THE DEBATE, CLEARLY.
Jon: WELL, NOT PART OF THE DEBATE. JUST CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE DEBATE THAT HER PRESENCE DROWNS IT OUT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I SWEAR TO GOD, SHE IS NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. SHE'S RUNNING TO BE THE MAYOR OF [BLEEP] BLOCKINGTON. OTHER THAN PALIN THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER THING THAT COULD DISTRACT THE PRESS CORPS.
THE HOT NEW DISH AT THE IOWA STATE FAIR IS DEEP FRIED BUTTER ON A STICK.
DEEP FRIED BUTTER.
FRIED PUT CERTIFICATE THE NEW BIG THING.
THAT NOT A CORN DOG, IT LOOKS LIKE A CORN DOG T SAY FRIED BUTTER LOG. YOU HEARD ME, A FRIED BUTTER LOG. THAT WILL COST YOU FOUR BUCKS AT THE IOWA STATE FAIR.
Jon: FOUR BUCKS! OF COURSE IF THAT'S TOO RICH FOR YOUR CLEARLY STRUGGLING BLOOD, FOR $2 THERE IS A  GENTLEMEN TOW FAIR WHO WILL FILL A SHOTGUN WITH CHEESE WIZ AND SHOOT IT UP YOUR ASS. WE HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE OF THE AMES STRAW POLL STARTING WITH JOHN OLVER WA, IS GOING ON.

IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
BECAUSE IT TASTES LIKE A PEACH JUST TOOK A DUMP-- .
Jon: IT'S JELLY.
IT'S NOT JELLY.
Jon: IT'S JELLY, IT'S JUST PEACHES AND SUGAR, HOW BAD CAN IT BE.
NO THERE'S NO SUGARMENT SANTORUM DOESN'T BELIEVE IN SUGAR. HE CALLS IT THE DEVIL'S GRANULES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ASIF MANDVI IS AT TIM PAWLENTY'S TENT. WHAT'S HAPPENING-- .
