(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW THE COUNTRY-- THIS COUNTRY OF OURS-- IT REMAINS SHARPLY DIVIDED OVER THE TRAGIC  KILLING OF TRAYVON MARTIN BY GEORGE ZIMMERMAN AND LATELY THERE'S BEEN A NEW SUGGESTION MA  THAT MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE FOCUSING ON THIS ONE INCIDENT SO MUCH AT ALL. NOBODY SAYS A WORD ABOUT THE FACT THAT ALMOST HALF OF THE MURDERS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE  OF BLACK PEOPLE AND 90% OF THEM ARE COMMITTED BY OTHER BLACK PEOPLE.
THE NATIONAL MEDIA DOESN'T DO STORIES ABOUT BLACKON BLACK CRIME.
WHERE'S THE OUTRAGE ABOUT THE BLACK-ON-BLACK CRIME.
NOBODY HAS A MARCH FOR THEM. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
Jon: FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE. (LAUGHTER) LAIRLY.
THANK YOU, JON. TWO THINGS: ONE, NO ONE HAS MARCHES AGAINST BLACKON BLACK VIOLENCE? HMM, THESE JUST A FEW FROM THE LAST SIX MONTHS. WHAT DO YOU THINK THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING? DO YOU THINK THERE'S THAT MANY TYLER PERRY MOVIE OPENINGS? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ACTUALLY, I THINK THERE MIGHT BE THAT MANY TYLER PERRY OPENINGS.
AND NUMBER TWO, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TRAYVON MARTIN SHOOTING AND BLACK ON  BLACK CRIME IS THAT WORD CRIME. YOU KNOW, THAT THING THAT PEOPLE GET ARRESTED FOR? SINCE THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION IS THE ONLY COURT THAT WILL TAKE THE CASE, EVERYONE  FEEL IT IS NEED TO JUMP IN AND DEFEND OR CONDEMN ZIMMERMAN. TO THE RIGHT HE'S AN UNFAIRLY VICTIMIZED DUDLEY DO-RIGHT AND  TO THE LEFT HE'S ELMER FUDD IF YOU HAD HUNTING DOWN BLACK PEOPLE. "SHH. BE VEWWY QUIET. I'M WACIALLY PROFIWING NEGWOES." (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT IS A VERY GOOD ELMER FUDD.
THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU. LOOK, THE POINT IS SOMEHOW THE DEATH OF A 17-YEAR-OLD KID GOT TURNED INTO A CHANCE TO SCORE  IDEOLOGICAL POINTS.
IF I HAD A SON HE WOULD LOOK LIKE TRAYVON.
IS THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTING THAT IF IT HAD BEEN A WHITE WHO  HAD BEEN SHOT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY? DISGRACEFUL.
TRAYVON WAS HUNTED DOWN LIKE A RABID DOG
WHY EVEN HAVE A TRIAL BASED ON WHAT SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE SAYING.
PLEASE DON'T SEND ME ANYMORE TWEETS ABOUT HAVING THIS  CONVERSATION THAT I'M A RACIST OR A RACE BAITER.
DON LEMON, YOU ARE A FIXATED ON THIS ONE ISSUE OVER AND OVER. WE WANT TO HEAR THE NEWS, NOT YOUR PERSONAL AGENDA. GO WORK FOR B.E.T. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
GO WORK FOR B.E.T.? (BLEEP) YOU! (LAUGHTER) WHAT IS THAT? TWITTER SPEAK FOR GO BACK TO AFRICA?
Jon: IT SEEMS... SO THE RIGHT HAS THIS... THEY HAVE TO DEFEND PEOPLE WHO ARE MAYBE  LEGITIMATELY SICK OF BEING CALLED RACIST AND THE LEFT IS DEFENDING PEOPLE WHO ARE  LEGITIMATELY CONCERNED ABOUT RACIAL PROFILEING BUT IT SEEMS WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS ACTUAL  CASE BECAUSE IT DEVOLVES INTO PEOPLE LEVELING OR DEFENDING THEMSELVES AGAINST CHARGES  AGAINST RACISM.
EXACTLY, JON, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RACIST TIME OUT.
Jon: WHAT?
AMERICA, FOR THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES NO MATTER WHAT IS SAID NOBODY'S RACIST.
Jon: A RACIST TIME OUT? (LAUGHTER)
FOCUS. THE POINT IS THIS. IF WE REMOVE ACCUSATIONS OF RACISM WE CAN FINALLY TALK CALMLY ABOUT THE RACIAL  ELEMENTSS OF THIS STORY.
Jon: SO THERE IS SOME RACIAL ELEMENTS IN THIS STORY. SOME RACISM IN THIS STORY?
WE GOT A HISPANIC GUY WITH A JEWISH NAME KILLING A BLACK GUY? IT'S GOT TO BE IN THERE SOMEWHERE. (LAUGHTER) FOLLOW ME, JOHN. GEORGE ZIMMERMAN SEES A BLACK GUY IN A HOODIE, BLACK GUYS IN HOODIES HAVE REPORTEDLY BEEN  BREAKING INTO HOMES SO THOUGH NOT RACIST, MAYBE A LITTLE RACE-Y.
Jon: BUT ZIMMERMAN FOLLOWS HIM EVEN THOUGH THE POLICE TOLD HIM NOT TO. THAT'S GOT TO BE RACE-ISH.
NO, THAT'S JUST STUPID. (LAUGHTER) AFTER THAT POINT WE HAVE DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF WHAT HAPPENED. BUT THE ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE, ZIMMERMAN KILLED TRAYVON AND THE POLICE LET HIM GO.
Jon: AH! SO THE PLACE WERE RACIST!
NOT THIS TIME. THEY WERE FOLLOWING THE LAW. NOW, ACCORDING TO "STAND YOUR GROUND" AS LONG AS ZIMMERMAN  FELT THREATENED HE HAD THE RIGHT TO RESPOND WITH LETHAL FORCE.
Jon: SO STAND YOUR GROUND LAW IS RACIST! I GET IT NOW!
NO, YOU DON'T GET IT, SHUT UP.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO IN FRONT AFTER A JURY. YOU TELL THE COPS AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME YOU WERE STANDING YOUR GROUND AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU  THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. THAT'S THE CULPRIT.
Jon: AH-HA! (LAUGHTER) THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT IS RACIST! (LAUGHTER)
EXACTLY, JON. EXACTLY.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW... WAIT. BLACK PEOPLE DON'T GET THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT?
IN SHOOTING CASES? (LAUGHTER) IT'S THE ONE ENTITLEMENT BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T GET FROM THE GOVERNMENT, JON. (AUDIENCE REACTS) LOOK... OH, SHUT UP. PLAXICO BURRESS WENT TO PRISON FOR TWO YEARS WHEN HIS GUN ACCIDENTALLY WENT OFF IN HIS PANTS! HE COULDN'T GET THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT FOR SHOOTING HIMSELF! (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, BLACK ON BLACK CRIME WIDELY REPORTED.
Jon: SO YOU THINK WHITE PEOPLE GET MORE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT IN SHOOTING CASES?
WELL, MAYBE NOT EVEN CONSCIOUSLY, JON, BUT LOOK. WHEN VICE PRESIDENT DVP SHOT HIS BUDDY IN THE CASE, OH, IT WAS JUST TWO WHITE GUYS HAVING FUN  WITH GUNS! (LAUGHTER) HEY! HEY! YOU PUMPED YOUR BUDDY FULL OF BIRD SHOT? YOU DIDN'T MEAN THAT, I GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. (LAUGHTER) COME ON, JON, CAN YOU IMAGINE IF OBAMA SHOT ERIC HOLDER IN THE FACE? (LAUGHTER) COME ON! TRUST ME. ONE OF THOSE (BLEEP)ERS WOULD BE GOING TO JAIL. THE ONLY THING IS, THAT WOULD BE THE LENGTH OF THE SENTENCE.
Jon: DID YOU JUST CALL PRESIDENT OBAMA THE "N" WORD? (LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, NOT, JON, GIVE ME THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. (LAUGHTER) I WAS THINKING OF ERIC HOLDER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S IT? SO SOON? OUR FIVE MINUTES IS UP. I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT CORNROWS.
NOT GANGSTER.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, LARRY. LARRY WILMORE,
