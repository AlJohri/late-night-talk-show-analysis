(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT BEST SELLING AUTHOR HIS NEW BOOK IS  CALLED DAVID CROCKETT, THE LION OF THE WEST. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MICHAEL WALLIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. NOW THIS IS AN EXCITING NIGHT FOR ME BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THE DAVID  CROCKETT BOOK, RARELY I DO GET A GUEST WHO IS AN AUTHOR, BE OF GREAT RENOWN PROMOTING A BOOK AND CAN ALSO PROMOTE AN ANIMATED FILM. YOU WERE IN CARS.
I WAS, INDEED. I WAS-- I WAS THE HIGH SHERIFF OF RADIATOR SPRINGS LOOKING FOR--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE.
AND I CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF TRACTOR TIPPERS OUT THERE IN THAT AUDIENCE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: AWESOME. DAVID CROCKETT. DAVID.
HE NEVER USED THE NAME DAVEY FOR HIMSELF. NEVER SIGNED IT DAVEY. SO IT WAS DAVID CROCKETT.
Jon: AND THAT, AND HE WAS NOT SHY ABOUT PROMOTING HIMSELF. SO HOW DID IT TURN INTO, IS THAT JUST A CREATION OF AMERICAN-- IT SOUNDED BETTER IN THE SONGS?
YEAH, AND THEN THE ALMANACS, AND WITH THE FOLKS IN GENERAL. I MEAN THE PEOPLE WOULD CALL HIM DAVEY CROCKETT, YOU KNOW. THAT WAS JUST HIS WAY OF IDENTIFYING HIMSELF.
NOW WHAT I KNOW OF DAVID CROCKETT IS THIS. I KNOW HE WAS BORN IN TENNESSEE. KILLED A BASH WHEN HE WAS THREE. AND THEN I LOSE THE TRAIL.
HE WAS ACTUALLY BORN IN THE STATE OF FRANKLIN BEFORE TENNESSEE BECAME A STATE. AND HE HAD NEVER KILLED A BEAR WHEN HE WAS ONLY THREE BUT HE WAS A PROFESSIONAL BEAR HUNTER. ONE SEASON HE SLEW 105 BLACK BEARS.
SO HE WAS AS MUCH OF A LEGEND AS HE WAS, AS MUCH HYPERBOWL AS WAS THERE, HE  ACTUALLY WAS THE REAL DEAL.
HE WAS THE REAL DEAL. THE TRUTH IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN FICTION. AND LIKE SO MANY OF BOOMERS, I GREW UP WITH THE-- PARKER IMAGE OF CROCKETT. AND IT WAS ENTERTAINING AND CHARMING WHEN YOU ARE NINE. BUT IT WASN'T THE REAL THING. CROCKETT LIKE SO MANY FIGURES FROM THE WEST, OTHERS I HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT, PRETTY BOY FLIED, BILLY THE KID, JESSY JAMES, THERE'S THE REAL MAN AND THEN  THERE'S THE MYTH. SO THE TWO OFTEN COLLIDE AND GET TOGETHER. AND IT HAPPENED DEFINITELY IN CROCKETT'S OWN LIFETIME.
THAT'S WHAT WAS SO SURPRISING IS THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT CROCKETT IN HIS  LIFETIME WAS SUCH A RENOWNED FIGURE AND THAT HE ACTUALLY ATTENDED A PLAY THAT WAS ABOUT HIM. AND I GUESS IT WAS IN 1831. AND HE --
IN WASHINGTON, D.C..
THAT'S RIGHT. AND HE OF COURSE SERVED SUCCESSFULLY IN CONGRESS FOR SEVERAL TIMES. AND HE WENT TO SEE THIS PLAY CALLED, AND THAT'S WHAT I USE FOR MY SUBTITLE, THE  LION OF THE WEST. AND HE KNEW IT WAS LOOSELY BASED ON HIM SOW WENT INTO THE THEATRE WITH HIS ENTOURAGE. THEY SEATED HIM IN THE FIRST ROW. EVERYONE WAS WONDERING WHAT'S CROCKETT GOING TO DO. WILL HE GET UP AND PUMMEL THE ACTOR PLAYING HIM OR YOU KNOW, WHAT WILL DO. WELL, THE FACTOR JAMES -- ACTOR JAMES HACKETT CAME LEAPING OUT ON THE STAGE IN  AN ALMOST BURR LESSING OVER THE TOP FRINGED OUTFIT NOT WITH A RACOON CAP ON BUT WITH A BOBCAT HAT. AND HE WAS CALLED NIMROD WILDFIRE. (LAUGHTER) SO I WOULD HAVE PUMMELED HIM.
Jon: I THINK MAYBE. BUT CROCKETT DIDN'T.
NIMROD MADE A BIG SWEEPING BOUGH. THERE WAS A HUSHED SILENCE. CROCKETT STOOD AND MAKE A BIG SWEEPING BOUGH BACK. REALITY-- AND MYTH MET RIGHT THERE.
Jon: IT'S AN AMAZING STORY. I WONDER IF HE WENT BACK AFTERWARDS AND SAID LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NAME NIMROD. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LET'S SEE IF WE CAN CHANGE THAT AROUND. NOW OBVIOUSLY FOR ME THE MYTHOLOGY OF DAVEY CROCKETT CEMENTS ITSELF AT THE ALAMO. BUT EVEN THAT STORY, YOU KNOW, HE IS SAID TO HAVE INVENTED TEXAS. DID HE GO THERE, THE IDEA IS HE WENT DOWN THERE TO FIGHT FOR LIBERTY IN TEXAS.
HE WENT DOWN THERE TO REBUILD HIS CAREER. HE HAD BEEN VOTED OUT OF CONGRESS LARGELY BECAUSE HE STOOD UP AGAINST HIS PRESIDENT AND FORMER  POLITICAL MENTOR ANDREW JACKSON OVER THE ISSUE OF INDIAN REMOVAL. THE TRAILS OF TEARS THAT LEAD TO WHERE I NOW LIVE, OKLAHOMA. AKA INDIAN TERRITORY. CROCKETT HAD SEEN THE HORRENDOUS ATROCITIES OF THE CREEK WAR. HE WANTED NO MORE OF THAT HE SAID TO JACKSON YOU'VE MESSED WITH THESE PEOPLE ENOUGH. LET THEM BE. AND HE WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE TENNESSEE DELEGATION TO VOTE AGAINST THE BILL. HE STOOD UP TO HIS PARTY, TO HIS CONSTITUENTS. WE NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE THAT IN CONGRESS.
I THINK SO.
I WOULD THINK SO.
SO HE WENT DOWN TO TEXAS.
AND HE WENT DOWN TO TEXAS.
SO JACKSON FOUND THE CANDIDATE TO RUN AGAINST HIM. AS CROCKETT LIKED TO POINT OUT, A ONE LEGGED MAN. THEY VOTED HIM OUT. AND THAT'S WHEN HE FAMOUSLY SAID MANY TIMES AD NAUSEAM, YOU ALL CAN GO TO HELL. I'M GOING TO TEXAS.
AND HE WENT DOWN THERE BECAUSE HE WAS GYPSY FOOTED AND HE WANTED TO LOOK AT NEW  TERRITORY AND REBUILD HIS CAREER AND HE WANTED TO HUNT EVERY DAY. HE TOOK WEEKS TO GET DOWN THERE. HE WAS CHASINGï¿½i BISON, LOOKING FOR HONEY TREES. THEY THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD HE FINALLY GOT DOWN THERE AND SAID I WOULD REALLY LIKE  THIS LAND AND HE SAID YOU CAN HAVE IT BUT YOU NEED TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MILITIA. THESE TEXTANS WERE REVOLTING AGAINST THEIR OWN COUNTRY. THEY WERE IN MEXICO. THEY WERE IMMIGRANTS THAT CAME INTO OLD MEXICO, INTO THE STATE OF TEJAS BUT THEY STILL KEPT COMING. HENCE THEY WERE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
OH MY GOSH. IF ONLY SANTA ANNA HAD BEEN ABLE TO BUILD THAT DANG FENCE.
WELL, SLAVERY WAS ABOLISHED IN MEXICO. SO THAT'S-- AND THEY WERE LARGELY SLAVES.
Jon: WE WERE HOPING IN SOME WAYS TO PRESERVE SLAVERY.
WE WANTED A PLANTATION SYSTEM IN TEXAS, OF COURSE. SO CROCKETT, YOU KNOW, UNBENOENS TO HIM, SIGNED UP FOR THE MILITIA. THEY SENT HIM TO THE BAT ERRED MISSION IN SAN ANTONIO AND AT 49 YEARS OF AGE THE  CURTAIN FELL ON CROCKETT AND NIMROD.
Jon: IT'S A A MAGNIFICENT STORY AND HIS THREE IS SO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY  FICTION COULD BE.
IT'S THE BEST.
Jon: I LOVE IT. DAVID CROCK SET ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MICHAEL WALLIS.
