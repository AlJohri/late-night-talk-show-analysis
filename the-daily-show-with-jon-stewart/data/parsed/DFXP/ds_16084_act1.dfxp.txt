JUNE 28, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JIEWRTDMENT WE EACH  GOT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. I'M TELLING YOU, IT IS A SHOW THE POPE WOULD TWEET ABOUT. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS LOUIS CK. VERY FEW OF YOU KNOW THIS, BUT THE CK IS SHORT FOR [BLEEPED] [LAUGHTER] YEAH, MAN. ALL DAY WE'RE HERE WRITING, ALL DAY. BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH NEWS OUT OF ILLINOIS. YOU MAY REMEMBER ABOUT A YEAR AGO FORMER GOVERNOR ROD BLAH... [STUMBLES OVER NAME] TOURED THE COUNTRY PROMISING HE'D BE VINDICATED OF ALL CHARGES. HE VISITED THE "DAILY SHOW" WHERE I MADE A PROMISE TO HIM. AGAIN, IF YOU GET OFF SCOT-FREE, THERE'S A HUG WAITING FOR YOU.
I'M DETERMINED TO WORK EVEN HARDER TO GET THAT.
Jon: WELL, TONIGHT I HAVE SOME VERY GOOD NEWS TO REPORT. I WILL NOT HAVE TO HUG ROD BLAGOJEVICH. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND HERE'S WHY:
IN CHICAGO TODAY, THE JURY SAID GUILTY 17 TIMES AS THE FORMER ILLINOIS GOVERNOR ROD  BLAGOJEVICH WAS CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED DISTORTION, BRIBERY, CONSPIRACY AND FRAUD.
Jon: 17 FELONY CONVICTIONS, OR AS THAT'S KNOWN, A CHICAGO DOZEN. [LAUGHTER] ON HIS WAY TO THE KRAUS TO HEAR THE VERDICT, BLAH... [STUMBLES OVER NAME] WAS UNUSUALLY CIRCUMSPECT
MY HANDS ARE SHAKY, MY NEEMS ARE WEEK, I CAN'T SEEM TO STAND ON MY OWN TWO FEET. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: QUOTING ELVIS ON YOUR WAY TO HEAR A CRIMINAL VERDICT  AND YOU GO WITH "ALL SHOOK UP"? "JAILHOUSE ROCK" DOESN'T COME UP IN THAT? "SUSPICIOUS MINDS"? ♪♪ I'M CAUGHT IN A TRAP ♪♪ NOTHING. OF COURSE, THAT WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE VERDICT BEING READ. AFTER WORDS, BLAH... [STUMBLES OVER NAME] WANTED PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT HE'D LEARNED HIS LESSON.
AMONG THE MANY LESSONS I'VE LEARNED FROM THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE IS TO TRY TO SPEAK A  LITTLE BIT LESS, SO I'M GOING TO KEEP MY REMARKS KIND OF SHORT.
Jon: YOU WEREN'T CONVICTED OF NOT BEING CONCISE. [LAUGHTER] YOUR WORDS ON OBAMA'S SENATE SEAT, "I'VE GOT THIS THING AND  IT'S [BLEEPED] GOLDEN AND I'M JUST NOT GIVING IT UP FOR  [BLEEPED] NOTHING." THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SUCCINCT. BUT ROD BLAH... [STUMBLES OVER NAME], HIS BEFORE-AND-AFTER REANGSTS ARE BUT SMALL PART OF WHAT'S TRULY  ASTONISHING THING ABOUT THIS STORY. THE TRULY ASTONISHING PART OF THIS STORY IS ROD BLAGOJEVICH IS THE FOURTH OUT OF THE LAST SEVEN  ELECTEDDED GOVERNORS OF ILLINOIS TO BE CONVICTED OF A FELONY. FOUR OUT OF THE LAST SEVEN. 57%. IF YOU WERE AN INDIVIDUAL IN ILLINOIS, YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF AVOIDING JAIL  BY FLIPPING A COIN, HEADS BEING JAIL, TAILS BEING NO JAIL, THAN BY BEING ELECTED GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS. LET'S SAY YOU'RE THE PRESENT GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS AND YOU'RE  IN A ROOM WITH A FORMER GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS ON YOUR RIGHT AND A FORMER GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS ON  YOUR LEFT. CHANCES ARE THE ROOM YOU'RE IN IS JAIL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOR MORE WE GO LIVE TO JOHN OLIVER. HE JOINS US FROM THE GATES OF THE FEDERAL PRISON IN MARION, ILLINOIS. JOHN OLIVER, TELL US A LITTLE BIT... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'M SORRY. TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PRISON WORLD TWO ROD BLAGOJEVICH IS VERY LIKELY ENTERING INTO.
HAPPY TO. JON, THE EXCITING THING FOR ROD BLAGOJEVICH ISN'T JUST THAT HE'LL BE SURROUNDED BY OTHER  ILLINOIS GOVERNORS, IT'S THAT ALL THREE BRANCHES OF ILLINOIS GOVERNMENTS ARE WELL REPRESENTED  IN THIS PRISON. [LAUGHTER] PRISON LAWS CAN BE MADE BY THEIR MANY CONVICTED LEGISLATORS. THOSE SAME LAWS INTERPRETED BY THEIR CONVICTED JUDGES. IT'S REALLY ABOUT CHECKS AND BALANCES.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. HOW DOES THE GOVERNOR, EX-GOVERNOR SURVIVE IN PRISON?
SIMPLY PUT, JON, HE BETTER GET IN GOOD WITH THE PRISON LOBBYISTS. [LAUGHTER] OBVIOUSLY THAT WILL REQUIRE TIRELESS CIGARETTE FUND-RAISING AND ACCESS TO THE BEST TOILET WINES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OUT OF RANDOM CURIOSITY, WHAT WOULD DISTINGUISH A GOOD TOILET WINE?
PEOPLE ARGUE ABOUT TANNINS AND THINGS, BUT MOST CONNOISSEURS WILL TELL YOU IT'S  ALL ABOUT THE URINE CONTENT. YES. JON AND LACK THEREOF I WOULD SUPPOSE. ABAPPALLING RECORD OF OFFICIAL CORRUPTION IN ILLINOIS. HOW CAN THAT STATE BREAK THE CYCLE OF GOVERNMENT CRIMINALITY?
JON, IT'S ABOUT GETTING TO THE CHILDREN OF ILLINOIS BEFORE  THEY GET LURED INTO THE MURKY WORLD OF ELECTED OFFICE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S INTERESTING. JOHN, CAN YOU HELP US OUT AND HELP THE PARENTS AT HOME? WHAT ARE SOME WARNING SIGNS PARENTS CAN KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR.
JON, THAT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. PARENTS HAVE TO BE ENGAGED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES TO SPOT THE RED FLAGS.
Jon: AND WHAT WOULD THOSE BE, JOHN? SUCH AS?
FOR STARTERS, JON, POSTER BOARD, MAGIC MARKERS, THAT TYPE OF PARAFA NAIL THAT CAN BE  INDICATIVE THAT THEY HAVE ASPIRATIONS TO RUN FOR STUDENT COUNCIL. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO EVEN STUDENT COUNCIL IS BAD?
WELL, IT'S A GATEWAY OFFICE, JON. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: JOHN, I HAVE A FRIEND. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HIM, A TEENAGER. HIS SON IS A TEENAGER, RECENTLY TURNED SULLEN AND COMBATIVE, AND HE'S QUITE SECRETIVE.
WELL, LUCKY HIM, JOHN, HE'S OKAY. A TIME TO WORRY IS WHEN YOUR CHILD BECOMES SUSPICIOUSLY EXTROVERTED, IF HE'S SUDDENLY  FOND OF CORNY JOKES OR LIKES TO WALK AROUND THE DINNER TABLE SHAKING HANDS AND ASKING, WHAT'S  GOOD HERE? WHAT ARE WE EATING? WHEN THE NEIGHBORS BRING A BABY OVER, DOES HE KISS IT REPEATEDLY ON THE CHEEK OVER AND OVER AGAIN  LOOKING FOR THE CAMERAS? IF SO, BING, YOU HE COULD BE LOOKING AT FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS IN THE ILLINOIS STATEHOUSE  FOLLOWED BY 15 TO 20 YEARS IN PRISON.
Jon: TERRIFYING, JOHN. DO YOU THINK IT'S GETTING THROUGH TO THE NEXT GENERATION?
WE CAN ONLY HOPE, BUT IT'S NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING. ALREADY THEY'RE LAUNCHING A STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN TO KEEP KIDS ON THE RIGHT TRACK. TALK TO YOUR CHILDREN, JON, TALK TO YOUR KIDS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH, JOHN OLIVER WITH THAT
