Jon: WELCOME BACK. LAST FRIDAY WAS A VERY EXCITING DAY. SAW THE RELEASE OF THE USA'S MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT REPORT, A!  K  A, THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN'S... HOW DID THAT GO?
ONLY 69,000 JOBS WERE ADDED TO AMERICA'S WORK FORCE LAST MONTH. THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS CLOSING DOWN ABOUT 270 POINTS.
THE NEWS HIT THE STOCK MARKET LIKE A PUNCH TO THE GUT.
NOWHERE TO HIDE ON THIS ONE. A POLITICAL STOMACH PUNCH.
AND A BODY BLOW TO CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY.
Jon: A FISCAL KICK IN THE BALLS. ECONOMIC INDICATOR OF KICKED BALLS. A DOWNTURN IN EVERYTHING BUT THE AMOUNT OF PAIN OF AMERICA'S RECENTLY KICKED BALLS. BAD NEWS, CRAPPY NEWS. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. TIME FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO PLAY ANOTHER ROUND OF AMERICA'S MOST FRAYING  RESIDENT GAME SHOW. HEY, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW THE RULES. THE OBAMA TEAM MUST FIND THE BEST WAYS TO SPIN THIS TURD INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE. TOP SEVEN ANSWERS ON THE BOARD. LET'S PLAY THE TURD.
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE 27 MONTHS STRAIGHT OF JOB GROWTH.
Jon: NICE. EVEN THOUGH JOB GROWTH FAILED TO KEEP UP WITH POPULATION GROWTH, THERE WERE AGAIN TECHNICALLY MORE JOBS LAST MONTH THAN THE PREVIOUS MONTH. ONE OF THE GREATEST PURVEYORS OF THESE SORTS OF GAME SHOWS. WE'RE LOOKING FOR TRUE BUT STILL  [BLEEP]
THE SURVEY SAYS. Jon: THE NUMBER THREE ANSWER. TRUE BUT STILL [BLEEP]. THERE ARE TWO SHINIER WAYS TO POLISH THIS TURD UP. WHO IS NEXT?
THE NATIONAL NUMBERS ARE NOT AS GOOD AS ANY OF US WOULD LIKE. THIS WILL NOT BE DECIDED IN CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORK OR ILLINOIS. IT WILL BE DECIDED IN FLORIDA, VIRGINIA, OHIO, IOWA AND IN STATES THAT REALLY HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN MANUFACTURING JOBS IN PARTICULAR. I THINK THERE'S A POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR THE PRESIDENT.
Jon: I SEE. LESS OF A TURD POLICY AND MORE OF A [BLEEP], UNLESS YOU LIVE IN A SWING STATE. RICHARD.
THE SURVEY SAYS... Jon: OH, THE NUMBER 4 ANSWER. NUMBER ONE ANSWER STILL ON THE BOARD. NEXT CONTESTANT. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO POLISH THAT TURD.
IN THE ASS? (BUZZER ).
Jon: I THINK THAT'S THE WRONG ANSWER AND THE WRONG GAME SHOW. BUT BAD ECONOMY. POLISH THAT TURD.
HAVE ANY CONVERSATION IN ALL OF THIS DEBATE ABOUT THE TWO WARS PRESIDENT BUSH FUNDED AND  PUT THEM ON THE CREDIT CARD. WHAT WAS STRIKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON FRIDAY WAS HOW QUICK THE LEADERS OF CONGRESS WERE OUT  THERE WRINGING THEIR HANDS. THESE ARE THE ARCHITECTS OF OBSTRUCTION.
LET ME TELL YOU THE STORY ABOUT MASSACHUSETTS UNDER GOVERNOR ROMNEY. IT DID FALL TO 47th OUT OF 50 IN JOB CREATION.
Jon: INTERESTING STRATEGY. OUR TURD STINKS BUT EVERYBODY ELSE SUCKS WORSE.
SURVEY SAYS... (BELL RINGING ).
Jon: JUST ONE MORE ANSWER TO GIVE. IS THERE ANY SORT OF NONPARTISAN TURD-POLISHING IN PLAY HERE?
WE DID HAVE A VERY WARM WINTER.
Jon: WHERE DID THAT ANSWER COME FROM? LET ME GUESS.
IN THE ASS? Jon: YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING. I'M AFRAID THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE. NO ONE EVER SAID OBAMA WOULDN'T BE A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT IF HE  DIDN'T FIX THE ENTIRE ECONOMY IN THREE YEARS.
A YEAR FROM NOW I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE WE'RE STARTING TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS  BUT THERE STILL WILL BE PAIN OUT THERE. IF I DON'T HAVE THIS DONE IN THREE YEARS, THEN THIS WILL BE A ONE-TERM PROPOSITION.
Jon: NEVER END A SENTENCE ON THE PROPOSITION. THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR...
POLISH THAT TURD. Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT
