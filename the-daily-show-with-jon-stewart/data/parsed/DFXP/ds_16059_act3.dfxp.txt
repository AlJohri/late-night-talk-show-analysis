Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AMERICAN HISTORIAN AND THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF WALLBUILDERS, DAVID BARTON. SIR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. APPRECIATE IT. SIT. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
MY PLEASURE.
Jon: SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED, SO WE HAVE MIKE HUCKABEE ON THE SHOW.
RIGHT. GOOD GUY.
Jon: VERY NICE GUY, GOOD FRIEND OF THE SHOW. WE ALWAYS HAVE REALLY INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS. SO I'M WATCHING HIM PRAISE YOU. HE WAS AT A CONFERENCE.
RIGHT.
Jon: HE SAID DAVID BARTON IS THE GREATEST HISTORIAN IN AMERICA AND ALL CHILDREN SHOULD  HAVE TO LEARN FROM HIM IN THEIR CURRICULUM. I'M PARAPHRASING.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, WELL, GEEZ, I'D LIKE THE MEET THE GREATEST HISTORIAN IN AMERICA. THEN I STARTED LOOKING UP YOUR STUFF, AND I THOUGHT, OKAY...
THAT'S A DANGEROUS THING TO DO.
Jon: THIS SEEMS ODD. SO I ASKED MIKE HUCKABEE ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN SAYING, AND HE SAID, WHY  DON'T YOU ASK DAVID BARTON HIMSELF. AND I SAID, OKAY. AND HERE I AM. SO HERE YOU ARE. SO LET ME ASK YOU, JUST FOR OUR AUDIENCE THAT IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT YOU DORK HOW WOULD YOU  DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS YOU DO?
I'D SAY HISTORICAL RECLAMATION. WE AND OUR COMPANY HAVE ABOUT 100,000 DOCUMENTS FROM BEFORE 1812. SO DOCUMENTS OUT OF BLACK HISTORY, OUT OF RELIGIOUS HISTORY, CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY, YOU NAME IT. WE'VE GOT 100,000 ORIGINALS. THAT'S WHAT WE TAKE A LOT OF HISTORY BACK TO, THOSE ORIGINAL THINGS THAT HAPPENED.
Jon: BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMS THE HISTORY YOU TAKE COMES BACK TO THE IDEA THAT WE ARE A MORE  CHRISTIAN NATION THAN WE ARE LIVING. IS THAT...
THAT'S NOT ACCURATE. THERE'S PEOPLE WHO POINT THAT OUT, BUT I'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD EXAMPLE. IN TEXAS I WAS APPOINTED AS AN EXPERT TO DO HISTORY IN GOVERNMENT STANDARDS THERE.
Jon: SO YOU ARE A CURRICULUM AUTHORITY?
FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS, CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, ALL THESE STATEDS, I DO THEIR HISTORY AND SOCIAL STUDIES STANDARDS. SO I'M ASKED BY THE GOUGH OR BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO DO THAT.
AND THIS MAY BE A MISCONCEPTION, BUT YOU DON'T... YOU ARE NOT A HISTORIAN IN TERMS OF ACADEMIC HISTORIAN. YOU DON'T HAVE A DOCTORATE.
NO. I'VE GOT ALL THE DOCUMENTS. THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN A LOT OF FUN BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH HISTORY  AND SCHOOL AND WHAT I GOT TAUGHT AND WHAT I SEE IN THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS AREN'T THE SAME THING. THAT'S WHAT GOT ME STARTED. SOME REALLY OLD DOCUMENTS CONTRA DINGTED MY SCHOOL BOOKS. SO WE SAY PUBLISHERS, HERE'S WHAT THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTS ARE, PRINT THE DOCUMENTS. GO BACK TO THE ORIGINALS. ON THE ISSUE OF RELIGION, BEING ONE OF THE GUYS APPOINTED IN TEXAS, ALL MY REVIEWS ARE ONLINE. THERE'S 43,000 WORDS ONLINE OF MY REVIEWS OVER THE LAST SET OF STANDARDS. ONLY TWO SUBJECTS DO I EVER MENTION CHRISTIANITY. ONE WAS THE TEACHER'S RECOMMENDED TAKING THE STUDY OF CHRISTMAS OUT OF THE HOLIDAY.
YOU ARE SAYING YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN...
OH, I AM. I AM.
Jon: OKAY.
AS AN EMPHASIS.
Jon: THAT'S YOUR ALMOST TOTAL EMPHASIS.
NO, IT'S NOT.
Jon: OH.
I KNOW THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT GO AFTER ME. AND WHEN I WAS ON THE TEXAS BOARD, THERE'S A GROUP THAT DID A PRESS RELEASE AND ALL OF A  SUDDEN MSNBC AND THE "TIMES," ALL THESE GROUPS...
BARTON IS CRAMMING CHRISTIANITY DOWN THEIR THROATS IN TEXAS. NO, THERE'S 43,000 WORDS, TWO REFERENCES TO CHRISTIANITY. THAT'S NOT A SUPER BIG EMPHASIS, NOT THAT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME, BUT WHAT I TEACH...
I WOULD SAY IN LEVITICUS, BEING DAY IS MENTIONED TWICE, BUT PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT KIND OF MAKE A BIG EMPHASIS OUT OF THAT.
THAT'S NOT A HISTORY ISSUE.
Jon:, NO BUT I'M SAYING I DON'T KNOW THAT...
LETS ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT.
Jon: PLEASE.
PUBLISHERS COME TO ME AND SAY YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE STANDARDS. AND I WHAWNS MY NAME EVOKES, SO I TOLD THE PUBLISHERS, I'LL BE  THE EDITOR, BUT DON'T PUT MY NAME IN THE NEXT BOOK. THAT TEXTBOOK I EDITED IS THE BESTSELLING PUBLISHED SCHOOL TEXTBOOK MANY AMERICA. HISTORIANS THINK IT'S A GREAT BOOK. THEY DON'T KNOW I DID IT.
Jon: WELL, NOT HISTORIANS.
TEACHERSEN
Jon: WHEN TEXAS MAKES A BOOK, IT'S NOT A FREE MARKET THING.
IT WAS BECAUSE I WORKED AT THE PUBLISHERS, NOT THE STANDARD IN TEXAS. THE PUBLISHERS CAME TO ME.
Jon: MORE PEOPLE ARE BUYING IT, IT'S CLEARLY BETTER.
WELL, YEAH, EXACTLY. BUT...
Jon: I THINK THE MAKERS OF CRACK MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT. BUT LET'S GET TO YOU BECAUSE I DO... YOU ARE AN IMPORTANT FIGURE. YOU GO IN AND YOU ARGUE IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT. YOU GO IN AND YOU WORK WITH OUR CONGRESS. YOU WORK WITH CONGRESS PEOPLE. YOU GO IN AND YOU WRITE CURRICULUM, AND I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT, AND IN YOUR  WRITINGS, YOU TALK ABOUT RECLAIMING OUR FORGOTTEN HISTORY.
RIGHT.
Jon: WHEN IT SEEMS TO ME SOMEONE WHO PROBABLY HAS A VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THIS  NATION'S HISTORY THAT YOU ARE REWRITING MORE THAN RECLAIMING.
LET ME GIVE A SHOT AT THAT. ONE THING I'M REALLY PROUD ABOUT THAT WE GOT DONE IN TEXAS IS WE TOOK THE NUMBER OF MINORITIES  WHO ARE COVERED IN THE STANDARDS FROM 9% TO 25%. THE WAY I DID IT IS SAID WE'RE NOT COVERING ANY OF THE JEWISH FOUNDING FATHERS OR THE BLACK  FOUNDING FATHERS, THE WOMEN OF THE REVOLUTION. WE'RE ALSO NOT COVERING HISPANICS IN THE REVOLUTION. THAT'S FORGOTTEN HISTORY. I BET YOU MOST JEWISH PEOPLE CAN'T NAME THE JEWISH FOUNDING FATHERS.
Jon: I CAN. SANDY KOUFAX.
EXACTLY. [LAUGHTER] YOU'RE RIGHT. SANDY KOUFAX. THAT'S ALL I GOT.
EXACTLY.
Jon: SO I AM INCORRECT IN SAYING THAT YOU... I'VE SEEN  TAPES OF YOU SPEAKING WHERE YOU MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THE BIBLE, THINGS LIKE  I WOULD LIKE THE SEE THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND THE ESTATE TAX GONE BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS SO.
THAT'S RIGHT. BUT THOSE ARE ALSO SPEECHES GIVEN TO GROUPS OF MINISTERS, AND I'M SPEAKING TO MINISTERS. THAT'S NOT A TEXTBOOK. THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT SETTING. FOR EXAMPLE...
Jon: YOU'RE SAYING THERE IS A WALL OF SEPARATION?
THERE IS. AND THAT IS... YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT CAME FROM, TOO.
Jon: A WALL OF SEPARATION WITHIN YOU OF CHURCH AND STATE?
NO, NO, ANY MORE THAN THE FOUNDERS WANTED IT. THEY WANTED SEPARATION OF THE INSTITUTIONS, NEVER SEPARATION OF THE INFLUENCE. NEVER AT ANY POINT DID THEY SAY...
THAT'S WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD HERE BECAUSE THAT'S  KIND OF WHAT I'M GETTING TO. AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT PROTEST THAT YOUR MAIN THRUST IS NOT TO GET US BACK TO THIS IDEA THAT  THE FOUNDERS DIDN'T WANT RELIGION SEPARATED FROM THE STATE, THE DOCUMENTS THAT YOU  PULL, GOING OFF THE CONSTITUTION, IT DOESN'T MENTION THE CREATOR. IT DOESN'T MENTION JESUS. IT DOESN'T MENTION PRAYING IN ANY WAY. SO WOULDN'T THEY BE EXPLICIT IN THE MENTION OF RELIGION IF THEY HAD WANTED IT SO BECAUSE THEY  WERE NOT COY PEOPLE FOR THE MOST PART.
THEY WERE NOT COY. THEY WERE VERY BLUNT. WHEN YOU READ THE FEDERALIST PAPERS, THEY SAID RELIGION BELONGS TO THE STATE. YOU READ THE STATE CONSTITUTIONS, THEY'RE EXTREMELY GRAPHIC ON RELIGION, BUT THERE  ARE SEVEN REFERENCES IN THE CONSTITUTION TO RELIGION, WHETHER IT BE ARTICLE 7. AND BY THE WAY, THE DECLARATION IS INCORPORATED INTO THE CONSTITUTION, SO THERE'S FOUR  REFERENCES TO GODS IN ARTICLE 7.
Jon: REFERENCES TO GOD ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN EXPLICIT... THEY WERE SO EXPLICIT THAT IF YOU WANT TO HOLD THIS OFFICE, YOU HAVE TO BE THIS AGE. BLACK PEOPLE COUNTED FOR THREE-FIFTHS. THEY USED FRACTIONS.
THAT'S ONLY FEDERAL OFFICE. THAT'S NOT RELIGION.
Jon: BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN SAY... THERE IS AN OATH OF OFFICE FOR THE PRESIDENT IS  TRANSCRIBED WORD FOR WORD IN THE CONSTITUTION.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: BUT THEY DON'T SAY YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON A BIBLE, AND  THEY DON'T MENTION GOD.
THAT'S RIGHT. BUT THE STATE LAWS IN ALL 13 STATES REQUIRED EVERY OATH TO BE DONE ON A BIBLE AND MENTION GOD.
Jon: BUT ONLY THREE OF THEM WERE STILL THERE. THAT LITMUS TEST WAS ONLY THERE WHEN THE BILL OF RIGHTS CAME INTO EFFECTED, ONLY THREE STATES  STILL HAD THOSE LAWS AND THE FOUNDERS HAD BEEN TRYING THE PHASE THAT OUT.
LET'S TAKE THE RELIGION SIDE. THE FIRST AMENDMENT SAYS "CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW RESPECTING AND ESTABLISHMENT OF  RELIGION." ONE CASE IN THE U.S. SUPREME COURT WAS RABBILESSLY GUTTERMAN  WAS ASKED IF PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND TO, GIVE A PRAYER AT A GRADUATION, AND HE WASN'T  ALLOWED TO. NOW, TELL ME HOW CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW MEANS THAT A RABBI  CAN'T SAY THE WORD "GOD" AT A PRAYERMENT THAT'S A PRETTY STRANGE PARSING OF THE CONSTITUTION. AND THAT'S WHAT I ARGUE IS CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW AS A RESTRICTION ON CONGRESS. IT'S NOT A RESTRICTION ON THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE TO SAY THE WORD "GOD" IN PUBLIC.
Jon: DO WE HAVE TO GO? DAMMIT. CAN WE GO AND THEN COME BACK? DO YOU MIND STICKING AROUND?
HAPPY TO.
Jon: THIS IS THE KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT I DON'T GET. SO I'M GOING TO COME BACK WITH IT. DAVID BARTON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK RIGHT AFTER THIS. IT WILL BE ON THE WEB.
