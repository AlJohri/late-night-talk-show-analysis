IF YOU ARE LIKE MOST PEOPLE, YOU'RE NOT WATCHING THIS SHOW RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER] YOU'RE WATCHING AMERICANS SWIM AND RUN MORE QUICKLY THAN MANY OTHER FINE SWIMMERS AND RUNNERS.
THE U.S. PICKED UP 11 MEDALS TODAY, INCLUDING FIVE GOLD.
U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A!
CROWD: U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A!
Jon: IT'S THAT EASY. I REALLY FEEL LIKE I CAN GET YOU PEOPLE TO MARCH ON ANOTHER COUNTRY RIGHT HERE. [LAUGHTER] IT IS A GREAT SHOWING BY AMERICA'S GREATEST JOCK, BUT WHAT OF THE NATION'S GREATEST NERDS?
THE MARS ROVER CURIOSITY LANDED SUCCESSFULLY AND SENT BACK ITS FIRST PHOTOS FROM THE  SURFACE OF THE RED PLANET.
Jon: U-S-B, U-S-B! BECAUSE OF THE PORT ON THE BACK OF THE... WELL, OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD ROVERS UP THERE BEFORE. THIS TIME, THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT.
THIS THING IS OUTFITTED WITH LASERS THAT CAN DRILL THROUGH CONCRETE. THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF SPECK TOMMER THES AND OVENS AND WAYS TO REALLY GATHER ALL THIS INFORMATION.
Jon: I GET THE LASERS. AND I GET THE SPECK SPECTOMETERS. OVENS? WE FIND LIFE ON MARS, HEY, WHAT'S UP, YOU GUYS WANT A PIZZA? [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, LAST TIME WE SENT THE ROVER, WE COVERED THE ROVER IN BUBBLE WRAP AND JUST THREW IT IN  THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF MARS, STANDARD STUFF. IT WASN'T VERY EXCITING.
WE'VE GOT LITERALLY SEVEN MINUTES TO GET FROM THE TOP OF  THE ATMOSPHERE TO THE SURFACE OF MARS GOING FROM 13,000mph TO 0.
Jon: GO ON.
WE SLAM INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. WE'RE STILL GOING ABOUT 1,000mph. IT HEATS UP AND IT GLOWS LIKE THE SURFACE OF THE SUN.
THE PARACHUTE IS THE LARGEST AND STRONGEST SUPERSONIC  PARACHUTE THAT WE'VE EVER BUILT.
WE HAVE TO GET THAT THING CHILLED OFF.
THIS BIG, HUGE PARACHUTE WE'VE GOT, IT WILL ONLY SLOW US DOWN TO 200mph. WE'VE GOT TO CUT IT OFF AND THEN COME DOWN IN ROCKETS. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
0 METERS ABOVE THE SURFACE, WE HAVE TO LOWER THE ROVER BELOW US ON A TETHER.
AS THE ROVER TOUCHES DOWN, IT IS NOW ON THE GROUND, IT'S IN A  COLLISION COURSE WITH THE ROVER. WE MUST CUT IT IMMEDIATELY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THE ROVER IS NOW READY TO COLLECTED ROCKS. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS AMAZING. WHAT THEY DID IS AMAZING. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY WHEN MISSION CONTROL GOT WORD OF THE SUCCESSFUL LANDING, THEY, IN  SCIENTIFIC TERMS, LOST THEIR  [BLEEPED]
TOUCH DOWN CONFIRMED. WE'RE SAFE ON MARS. [WILD CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THAT'S IT. [CHEERING]
CROWD: U-S-A, U.S.A. SAY!
Jon: THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH COUNTRY TO CHEER NOW. U-S-A, IT'S GERMAN ENGINEERS, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. THEY'RE GOING NUTS. STATISTICALLY SPEAKING THERE'S A VERY HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT ONE OF  US IS GOING TO GET LAID TONIGHT. I FOR ONE AM GOING TO OPTIMIZE MY CHANCES WITH SHIRLEY IN PROPULSION. [LAUGHTER] SADLY THE CELEBRATION WAS CUT SHORT SO THAT THE MISSION CONTROL CREW WOULDN'T BE LATE TO  THEIR SHIFT AT BEST BUY. WOW! BAM! THOSE PEOPLE JUST LANDED A ROBOT ON [BLEEPED] MARS AND I MADE FUN OF THEM. U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.!
