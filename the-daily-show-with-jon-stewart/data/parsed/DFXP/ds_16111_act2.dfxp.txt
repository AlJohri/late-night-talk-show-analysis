(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK! OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF DIFFERENT STORIES FOR US TO CHOOSE FROM ON OUR WAY BACK FROM VACATION. NO ONE IS GOING TO AGREE SPECIFICALLY ON WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE HERE OR THERE. BUT I BELIEVE WE WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T ADDRESS AN INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED YESTERDAY AT A  LABOR DAY RALLY FOR THE PRESIDENT. TEAMSTERS UNION LEADER JAMES HOFFA, JR.-- I'M SURE, NO RELATION-- TOOK THE STAGE TO  WARM UP THE CROWD FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS ONLY A FOREMAN CAN.
EVERYBODY HERE HAS GOT TO VOTE. IF WE GO BACK AND WE KEEP THE EYE ON THE PRIZE, LET'S TAKE THESE SON OF A BITCHES OUT AND  GIVE AMERICA BACK TO AMERICA WHERE WE BELONG!
Jon: AND DON'T TOUCH MY MICROPHONE (BLEEP) FACE, THAT'S A UNION JOB! (LAUGHTER) SEEMS LIKE GOOD PEOPLE. IF HOFFA'S GOAL... (LAUGHTER). IF HOFFA'S GOAL WAS TO GET PEOPLE UP ON THEIR FEET AND HOLLERING, HE SUCCEEDED.
THIS IS INCITING VIOLENCE. IT IS CALLING TO TAKE US OUT. WHAT EXACTLY DOES HE MEAN BY TAKE US OUT.
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD REPUDIATE IT.
WHERE IS USING THIS SORT OF RHETORIC IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS SILENT. IT'S SHAMEFUL AND DISGUSTING.
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR A RESPONSE TO TAKING SONS OF BITCHES OUT.
Jon: SHAME ON YOU! SHAME ON YOU, JAMES HOFFA! GRETCHEN CARLSON WAS SO UPSET SHE LEFT HER PROM EARLY TO REPORT ON THIS! THAT IS NOT RIGHT! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) DENY THE PARTY. OF COURSE YOU CAN SAY IT'S ODD THAT THE TEA PARTY AND THE RIGHT HAVE SUDDENLY DEVELOPED AN  ALLERGIC REACTION TO VIOLENT RHETORIC SINCE THEY'VE SPENT THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS TALKING  LIKE THIS.
GET YOUR MUSKET TO FIX YOUR BAYONET AND THE CHARGE IS TO THE RIGHT.
Jon: TO BE FAIR, HE WAS KEYNOTING THE BROKEN BAYONET ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. BUT TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT, THUS POINTS OUT THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN THE  PRESIDENT'S CALL TO TONE DOWN POLITICAL RHETORIC AT RALLIES, WHERE THERE IS ALWAYS A FINE LINE TO SPUR PEOPLE TO GO VOLUNTEER TO GO DOOR TO DOOR AND  PASS OUT POLITICAL PAMPHLETS AND REVVING THEM UP WHERE THEY BELIEVE THE ONLY OPTION IS THE  RIP OFF THE HEADS AND (BLEEP) DOWN THE NECKS OF THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH THEM ON TRADE  POLICY ISSUES. THE TRUTH IS, MOST RALLY TECHNIQUES ARE LAME. WITHOUT HYPERBOLIC METAPHORICAL INCITEMENTS TO VIOLENCE YOU'RE LEFT WITH A FEW OPTIONS.
TONIGHT WE SAY HELP IS ON THE WAY AND HELP IS ON THE WAY! AND HELP IS ON THE WAY! (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I WILL LIFT THE BENEFITS OF A 2% INCREASE IN THE TOP MARGINAL TAX RATE AND THEN  YOU WILL RESPOND WITH SOME VARIATION OF MY "HELP IS ON THE WAY" PHRASE ESTABLISHING A  RHYTHMIC DYNAMISM WHICH WILL PROPEL US TO... WHERE'S EVERY... HELLO? (LAUGHTER) OR YOU COULD PUMP UP THE CROWD AT A RALLY BY GETTING A HIGH-PROFILE CELEBRITY TO REMIND  PEOPLE THAT MOST CANDIDATES HAVE TWO NAMES.
I SAY HOWARD YOU SAY DEAN! HOWARD...
DEAN!
HOWARD...
DEAN! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW DID HE LOSE? (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, IT'S CLEAR THAT USING INCENDIARY RHETORIC IS THE KEY  TO MOTIVATING YOUR POLITICAL BASE. BUT THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW TO DO THAT WHILE STILL DISTANCING YOURSELF FROM ANY RAMIFICATIONS  OF SAID INCENDIARY RHETORIC. THIS IS WHY I GIVE YOU THE POLITICAL RALLY WEAPON OF THE FUTURE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I PRESENT TO YOU MR. YUCKLES. MR. YUCKLES IS... (APPLAUSE). HE'S THE LOVABLE SOCIOPATHIC VENTRILOQUIST DUMMY WHO DRIVERS YOUR BLOOD THIRSTY MESSAGE WHILE  YOUR HANDS STAY CLEAN. LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS. I NEED YOU ALL TO COME OUT AND SUPPORT US ON ELECTION DAY.
WHERE IS SO WE CAN RUN OUR OPPONENTS THROUGH A (BLEEP)ING MEAT GRINDER! (LAUGHTER) LET'S TAKE OUR VOTES AND SHOVE THEM UP THEIR ASSES SIDEWAYS! LITERALLY! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: MR. YUCKLES, THAT'S NOT VERY NICE!
THEY'RE TRAITORS AND TERRORISTS TO THE STATE AND THEY DESERVE TO BE DROWNED LIKE A  SACK OF KITTENS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: MR. YUCKLES, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE SAYING THESE THINS ABOUT OUR POLITICAL  OPPONENTS THAT I WOULD NEVER SAY OR EVEN THINK.
WHERE IS WHEN I SAY (BLEEP) YOU SAY (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) SKULL (BLEEP)! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WITH THEIR BALLS
