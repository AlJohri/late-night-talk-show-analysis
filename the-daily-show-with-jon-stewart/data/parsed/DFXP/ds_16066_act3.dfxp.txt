MY GUEST TONIGHT, CON TRIB UTILITYING EDITOR AT THE LOS ANGELES TIMES MAGAZINE AND AN  INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED AN UNDEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CENSORED HISTORY OF AMERICA'S TOP SECRETS. PLEASE WELCOME ANNIE JACOBSEN. HELLO. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THIS IS REALLY A GREAT BOOK. AREA 51. SO THIS IS AREA 51 IS A MILITARY BASE.
YES, IT IS. IT'S A MILITARY BASE IN SOUTHERN NEVER NEVER, 75 MILES FROM VEGAS.
Jon: 75 MILES FROM VEGAS.
WE SET OFF 100 NUCLEAR BOMBS THERE DURING THE COLD WAR IN THE AIR.
Jon: ABOVE VEGAS.
A LITTLE NORTH OF VEGAS.
Jon: IS THAT HOW VEGAS BEGAN? BECAUSE AT AROUND THE SAME TIME THIS NUCLEAR RADIATION IS SPILLING OUT OVER THE DESERT, BUGSY SIEGEL HAD AN IDEA.
YES, MAYBE THAT'S WHY VEGAS IS THE WAY IT IS.
Jon: WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS STAYS IN VEGAS, ESPECIALLY THE RADIATION. [LAUGHTER]
AND WHAT HAPPENS AT AREA 51 HAS STAYED AT AREA 51 UNTIL MY BOOK.
Jon: BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT AREA 51?
WELL, I INTERVIEWED 74 MEN WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO THE BASE, 32 OF WHOM LIVED AND WORKED THERE FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. SO I GOT THE KIND OF SCOOP OF WHAT REALLY WAS GOING ON THERE STARTING IN '51.
Jon: HERE'S THE CRAZIEST PART ABOUT YOUR BOOK. YOU DO ALL THIS RESEARCH. YOU DEBUNK THE IDEA THAT IT'S ALIENS.
BASED ON A SOURCE, YES.
Jon: BASED ON A SOURCE. BUT WHAT IS IN THE BOOK IS ACTUALLY ALMOST MORE DISTURBING THAN THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS AN  ALIEN VISITATION IN ROSWELL. PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD TO PETITION THEM TO INFORM HIM WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT WHAT HAPPENS THERE.
YES, PRESIDENT CLINTON INVESTIGATED THE CRIMES OF THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION, WHO IS  IN CHARGE OF PART OF THE BASE OUT THERE, AND THEY DENIED SOME INFORMATION TO HIM BASED ON THE  IDEA THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE A NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT. THE WHOLE BASE WORKS ON A NEED TO KNOW, SO YOU ONLY GET TO KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. AND THEY FELT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW SOME THINGS, AND I WRITE ABOUT THAT...
Jon: WHO DECIDES THAT THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW? THAT'S I GUESS MY POINT. THERE IS A GUY, OH, THE PRESIDENT, THAT'S OKAY, HE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW?
WELL, IT'S UNFORTUNATE, BUT I START THE BOOK OUT BY EXPLAINING  TO YOU THAT THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION, NOW CALLED THE D.O.'EM, THE DEPARTMENT OF  ENERGY, THEY HAVE A SEPARATE SYSTEM OF SECRET KEEPING FROM THE PRESIDENT'S SYSTEM. THIS IS A FACT. IT'S NOT KNOWN BY A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT IT'S HOW I BEGIN THE BOOK BECAUSE IT PLAYS TO THE  WHOLE NARRATIVE ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON OUT THERE AND WHY IT IS THE WAY IT IS. NOW, THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION ISN'T THE ONLY ORGANIZATION OUT THERE. YOU HAVE THE PENTAGON, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE C.I.A.
Jon: THE ILLUMINATI, THE MASONS. BUT THE FAMOUS STORY OF THE ALIENS THAT LAND IN ROSWELL AND GET TAKE ON THE AREA 51, THE  STORY YOU COME UP WITH IN THE BOOK BASED ON AN EYEWITNESS THAT YOU TRUST IMPLICITLY IS FAR  CRAZIER ALMOST THAN ALIENS. TELL US THAT STORY.
IT IS. WELL, I'LL PREFACE IT BY SAYING THIS, I GOT A MESSAGE FROM A CONSPIRACY THEORIST GROUP IN THE  U.K., AND THAT WERE VERY UPSET WITH ME AND SAID, EVEN WE DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
Jon: WE DON'T BELIEVE YOU AND WE'RE NUTS. [LAUGHTER]
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jon: YOU BELIEVE THAT STALIN SENT A SPACECRAFT TO US IN THE '50s BECAUSE THEY  DIDN'T HAVE A NUCLEAR BOMB YET. THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD DO AN ORSON WELLS-TYPE SCARE. WHO WAS ON THE SPACECRAFT?
WELL, THERE WERE SOME CHILD-SIZED AVIATORS. THAT'S WHAT IS MOST DISTURBING ABOUT MY BOOK. I HOPE YOU START AT PAGE ONE.
Jon: YOU REALLY SHOULD BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO START  WITH THE DISTURBING PARTS, LIKE SOMEONE I KNOW DID.
BUT IT WAS IN 1947 THAT STALIN SENT THIS CRAFT. AND IT REALLY DID LAND IN NEW MEXICO ACCORDING TO MY SOURCE WHO RECEIVED THE EQUIPMENT AT AREA 51.
Jon: AND THE TWO BROTHERS THAT FOUND THIS CRAFT...
THE TWO BROTHERS WHO DESIGNED IT WERE FORMER GERMAN AEROSPACE... THEY USED TO WORK  FOR HITLER, AS A LOT OF OUR SCIENTISTS DID.
Jon: SURE. WE ALL WORKED FOR HITLER AT SOME POINT.
THEY CERTAINLY DID. BUT THE HORTON BROTHERS CREATED THIS FLYING DISK ORIGINALLY FOR THE THIRD REICH, AND THEN STALIN  STEPPED IN AND TOOK AWAY A LOT OF THEIR SCIENTISTS AND THE UNITED STATES' GOVERNMENT TOOK A  LOT OF THE THIRD REICH SCIENTISTS FOR US. AND SO WHAT WENT ON, A LOT OF WHAT WENT ON AT AREA 51 WAS THIS INTENSE SCIENTIFIC PUSHING  SCIENCE TO THE GREAT EXTREME. THAT'S WHAT I WRITE ABOUT.
Jon: ARE THEY STILL DOING, THAT AND HOW MUCH OF THE FILES DID THEY OPEN UP TO YOU?
WELL, NONE OF THE FILES ABOUT THE STALIN DISK ARE OPENED UP AT ALL. THAT INFORMATION CAME ONLY FROM AN ANONYMOUS... THE ONLY SOURCE I KEEP ANONYMOUS IN MY BOOK IS...
Jon: THEY DON'T ADMIT THAT AREA 51 EXISTS. OUR GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ADMIT THERE'S AN AREA 51. PUT UP THE PICTURE OF AREA 51. THAT'S HOW BIG THE DAMN THING IS, AND THEY SAY IT DOESN'T EXIST.
ANYONE... IF YOU CALL UP THE AIR FORCE, YOU CAN GET THEM ON THE PHONE AND ASK THEM, AND  THEY'LL TELL YOU NO COMMENT OR THEY WON'T SAY IT EXISTS. JON JANUARY LET ME JUST VERY QUICKLY URGE MY AUDIENCE TONIGHT NOT TO DRUNK DIAL THE AIR FORCE PLEASE. [LAUGHTER] YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT JUST UNLEASHED ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE GOING TO BE BOMBING RAIDS AT FRATERNITY HOUSES. NUKE V.C.U. DO YOU THINK WE WILL EVER QUITE UNDERSTAND THE DEPTH OF OUR MILITARY RESEARCH THAT HAS  OCCURRED AT AREA 51?
WELL, I WRITE ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT WENT ON IN THE '50s AND  THE '60 HAS THE HAVE BEEN DECLASSIFIED, BUT THE NAME "AREA  51" IS ALWAYS BLACKED OUT OF THE DECLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS. SO WHO KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON THERE '70s, '80s, '90s. THE DRONES THAT WE FIGHT THE WAR ON TERROR WITH ARE BEING DEVELOPED THERE, WERE DEVELOPED  THERE AND ARE BEING DEVELOPED IN THE FUTURE.
Jon: WOULDN'T IT BE COOL IF THEY JUST GAVE UP ON THAT  [BLEEPED] AND NOW THEY'RE LIKE, I WANT TO MAKE A BANANA THAT YOU CAN EAT THE SKIN. I MEAN, IT'S ALL JUST... [LAUGHTER] READ IT FROM PAGE ONE. IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND. AREA 51 IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. ANNIE JACOBSEN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
