WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTRESS HER NEW FILM IS "RISE  OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. ".
IT WILL SOON GROW INTO A LARGE POWERFUL ENEMY. I LOVED THEM BUT I'M ALSO AFRAID OF THEM. IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE AFRAID OF THEM. [LAUGHTER]
HE'S HAPPY. COME ON.
I CAN SEE THAT. CAN WE AT LEAST GIVE HIM OPEN SPACE.
Jon: I AUDITIONED FOR THAT ROLE. PLEASE WELCOME FREIDA PINTO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. WHICH ROLE DID YOU AUDITION FOR.
Jon: THE CHIMP. I ROLLED AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT AND THEY SAID TOO MARSUPIAL.
I THOUGHT IT WAS JAMES FRANCO'S ROLE.
Jon: THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT FRANCO AND I WOULD BE IN THE SAME ROOM FOR. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS NOT AN ACTUAL CHIMP IN THAT SCENE.
THAT'S ANDY -- THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T GET THE ROLE.
Jon: THAT'S A GUY?
THE AMAZING ACTOR WHO DID LORD OF RINGS AND KING KONG.
Jon: THAT'S INCREDIBLE. HAS HE EVER BEEN IN ANYTHING WHERE HE IS NOT HIDEOUSLY DEFORMED.
HE'S DONE QUITE A BIT. WE SAW A CLIP OF HIM IN 13 GOING ON 30 DOING A DANCE MOVE. DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THAT?
Jon: YEAH, NO. NOBODY SAW THAT. [LAUGHTER] THEY ARE ALL GOING TO RENT IT TONIGHT. [LAUGHTER] AS IT WAS. IS IT DIFFICULT -- SO IS ANDY CIRCUS IN THAT MOMENT IS HE DRESSED LIKE A CHIMP?
HE IS A GRAY MOTION CAPTURE SUIT WHICH YOU SAW IN AVATAR AS WELL. HE HAS ALL THESE DOTS AND A CAMERA ON HIM. WHAT IS AMAZING IS NOT HAVING A REAL APE WHO CANNOT EMOTE THE WAY ANDY CAN BECAUSE HE IS HUMAN  AND TRAINED TO DO THAT AND HE'S SPECIFICALLY TRAINED --
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION AS AN ACTOR, HOW BIG A COMPLIMENT IS:  YOUR BETTER THAN  AND APE? IS THAT CONSIDERATE IN SOME WAY?
IN TODAY'S GIVEN AGE, GIVEN THE CONFLICT OF OUR TIMES I THINK IT'S AMAZING. WE DON'T NEED TO TORTURE ANIMALS.
Jon: THAT'S TRUE. REAL CHIMPANZEES AS AMAZING AS THEY ARE ARE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND UNPREDICTABLE. THEY ARE NOT MEANT TO, LET'S SAY DRESS UP AND PLAY THE DRUMS FOR US.
NOT AT ALL.
Jon: WERE THERE ANY ACTUAL ANIMALS OR WAS IT ALL PEOPLE IN CAPTURE YOU SUITS.
EXCEPT FOR A DOG, JUST PEOPLE IN A SUIT --
Jon: THAT WOULD BE BAD. BUT A HECK OF A CAST PARTY. [LAUGHTER] WERE YOU FAMILIAR WITH -- THE PLANET OF APES FILMS CAME UP WHEN I WAS A YOUNGSTER -- DID  YOU GO BACK AND LOOK?
MY MOM WAS A BIG FAN. I HAD SEEN BITS AND PIECES WHEN I WAS LITTLE. I FOUND IT GIMMICKY. I WAS NOT A BIG FAN BACK THEN. NOW IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.
Jon: IT IS, IF I MAY, A BIT GIMMICKY. I WAS A FAN BACK THEN. WHEN YOU WATCH IT NOW YOU REALLY DO GO, WOW, THEY GOT ME ON THAT. [LAUGHTER] HAVE YOU SEEN THE PART WITH CHARLTON HESTON ON THE BEACH.
I HAVEN'T, NO.
Jon: DUDE, YOU HAVE TO --
YOU JUST CALLED ME DUDE.
Jon: IT WAS AN HONOR. IT'S THE EXACT SAME WORD I USED WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAT WITH ME AND I CALLED HIM DUDE.
I LIKED IT.
Jon: THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THAT IS HE DIDN'T CARE FOR IT AS MUCH. KHALTON HESTON WAS ON THE BEACH AND HE LOOKS UP AND SEES THAT THE PLANET HE HAD BEEN ON WAS  HIS OWN. YOU -- YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.
I'LL RENT IT TONIGHT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT TYPE OF THING.
I'M GOING TO RENT IT TONIGHT.
Jon: YOU PROBABLY SHOULD. ARE YOU SAYING -- DO YOU SPEND TIME HERE LOS ANGELES, MUMBAI --
ALL OVER THE PLACE. WHEREVER WORK TAKES ME. I SPENT SIX MONTHS IN CANADA SHOOTING BACK-TO-BACK. I GO BACK TO INDIA WHEN I GET THE TIME AND I LOVE LONDON IT'S MY SECOND HOME.
Jon: YOU ARE LIKE AN KID. THEN THIS SOON INCREDIBLE LIFE.
I'M 26 BUT THAT'S AMAZING.
Jon: TO ME YOU ARE A KID. YOU INDUSTRIAL THAT -- YOU INDUSTRIAL THAT NEW CAR SMELL. -- YOU STILL HAVE THAT NEW CAR SMELL.
THANK YOU.
Jon: SO NICE TO MEET YOU. CONTINUED SUCCESS. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. IT'S IN THE THEATERS ON FRIDAY. NO CHIMPS WERE HURT IN THE PRODUCTION.
