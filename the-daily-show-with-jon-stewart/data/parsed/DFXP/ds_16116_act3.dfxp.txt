Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS A GRAMMY-WINNING ARTIST AS WELL AS AN ACTOR WHOSE TV SERIES "HELL  ON WHEELS" PIERCE ON SEPTEMBER 26th. HIS NEW MEMOIR IS CALLED "ONE DAY IT WILL ALL MAKE SENSE." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM COMMON. SIR. [APPLAUSE] COMMON, I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M ASSOCIATING WITH YOU RIGHT NOW. I FEEL IT'S TERRIBLY DANGEROUS FOR ME. LET'S TALK VERY QUICKLY ABOUT THE DUST-UP THAT HAPPENED TO YOU. YOU WERE INVITED TO A POETRY READING AT THE WHITE HOUSE. IS THAT CORRECT?
YES.
AND YOU ACCEPTED IT?
I DEFINITELY DID.
Jon: AND THAT WAS CAUSE FOR MANY NEWS ORGANIZATION, ONE NEWS ORGANIZATION... [LAUGHTER] TO SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS THE REINCARNATION OF CHE GUEVARA HAD BEEN INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT DID I FEEL LIKE TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT FIRESTORM, TO ACCEPT AN INVITATION TO A WHITE  HOUSE YOU HAD ALREADY BEEN TO A COUPLE OF TIMES? WHAT DID THE FIRESTORM FEEL LIKE?
WELL, AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS HUMOROUS. I'M LIKE, REALLY, THEY THINK THAT I'M THE PERSON THAT'S A  NEGATIVE, A NEGATIVE RAP ARTIST, AND THEN I REALIZED THAT THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW ME BECAUSE IF  THEY HAD, THEY WOULDN'T COME OUT AND SAY THAT I RAP ABOUT KILLING COPS, AND, YOU KNOW, ANYBODY  THAT KNOWS ME KNOWS I PUT OUT MUSIC ABOUT LOVE. I PUT OUT MUSIC ABOUT SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS, COMMUNITY, GOD, HAVING FUN.
Jon: BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, THE SWEATER YOU'RE WEARING, THAT'S A VERY THICK COLLAR. THAT'S UNUSUAL. THAT COULD SCARE WHITE PEOPLE.
OH, MAN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: A LOT OF WHITE PEOPLE WEAR SOMETIMES THINNER COLLARS ON THEIR SWEATERS. AND THEN YOU COME IN...
DOES MY TIE HELP THE WHOLE OUTFIT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I FEEL A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH IT, BUT...
POLITICALLY CORRECT, RIGHT?
Jon: BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN... YOU KNOW, ALMOST A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE. HOW DID YOU... DID ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU KNOW, YOUR E-MAIL GO OFF WHEN THIS WAS OCCURRING?
WELL, IT WAS STRANGE. I WAS WORKING ON A PROJECT CALLED "HELL ON WHEELS," AND WHILE WE WERE FILMING, I WAS  GETTING TEXTS, AND WHEN I CAME BACK I SEEN ONE OF MY FRIENDS TEXTED ME AND SAID, DON'T LET IT  GET TO YOU. I WAS WONDERING WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. I'M LIKE, WHAT, DID SOME GIRL SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ME? SO THEN I STARTED GETTING MORE TEXTS SAYING, THAT THEN I REALIZED SOME OF MY TEAM MEMBERS  TOLD ME, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE SAYING FOX NEWS AND SARAH PALIN SAID THIS AND THAT ABOUT YOU, THAT YOU ARE THIS TYPE OF ARTIST. THAT'S WHEN I WAS LIKE REALLY, YOU SURE? SARAH PALIN MUST HAVE NEVER HEARD ANY OF COMMON'S MUSIC. SHE'S NEVER BEEN...
Jon: I THINK WHEN SHE'S ON THE BUS TOURING THE GREAT STATES  OF AMERICA, SHE MAY GET DOWN. WE DON'T KNOW. BUT YOU COME OUT. NOW, THIS BOOK IS YOUR MEMOIR. IT'S BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. YOU REALLY ARE A WONDERFUL WRITER. AND YOU ARE ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH... AS I WAS READING IT, I  WAS THINKING, BOY, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MYSELF. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE VERY OPEN ABOUT THINGS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SPEED. WAS IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO THAT POINT?
NO, I THINK IT STARTED WITH JUST BEING RAISED BY MY MOTHER, WHO TAUGHT ME TO LOVE MYSELF. AND SHE LOVED ME SO STRONG THAT I FELT CONFIDENT IN MYSELF ENOUGH TO BE AROUND WHOEVER I  AM, WHOEVER I'M AROUND, I CAN BE MYSELF.
Jon: UH-HUH.
AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO BE OPEN BECAUSE WE'RE ALL HUMAN BEING, MAN. WE ALL HAVE GREAT THINGS ABOUT US, AND WE ALL HAVE FLAWS. WE JUST ARE WORKS IN PROGRESS.
Jon: WHY DID YOU SAY WHEN YOU SAID "FLAW," YOU LOOKED DIRECTLY AT ME, BECAUSE I  THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING. "FLAWS," AND THEN YOU LOOKED UP, I SEE 'EM, RIGHT THERE. YOUR MOTHER ACTUALLY, AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS INTERESTING, WRITES, YOU KNOW, ALMOST ANNOTATES THE BOOK. SHE WRITES ABOUT SOME OF THE STORIES THAT YOU'RE WRITING ABOUT, GIVING ANOTHER  PERSPECTIVE ON IT, WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING.
YEAH, I MEAN, THAT VOICE IN THE BOOK OF MY MOTHER IS REALLY THE VOICE THAT SHE IS IN MY LIFE. YOU KNOW, AS I WALK THROUGH LIFE AND MAKE SOME GOOD CHOICES, I CAN HEAR HER SAYING, YES, GOOD CHOICE. AND THEN SOMETIMES I MAKE SOME BAD ONES, AND SHE'S LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SON, COME ON. TO HAVE HER PERSPECTIVE ACTUALLY WAS INSIGHTFUL FOR ME, TOO, BECAUSE SOME OF THAT WISDOM THAT I STILL... YOU STILL NEED TO KNOW AND YOU STILL NEED TO LIKE  REMEMBER, AND IT ALSO REMINDS YOU OF WHERE YOU COME FROM.
THERE WERE CERTAIN POINTS IN THE BOOK, AND THEN IT GETS TO YOUR DISCOVERY OF WHAT I GUESS  I'LL CALL "THE LADIES."
THE LADIES. THE LADIES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT IS A CHANT THAT'S OFTEN USED, THE LADIES, AND IT  IS RELATIVELY OPEN AND GRAPHIC, AND I REMEMBER AS I WAS READING IT, I JUST KEPT THINKING, COMMON, YOUR MOM IS ON THE PAGE RIGHT BEFORE THIS. I THINK SHE CAN HEAR YOU. DID SHE READ THE WHOLE BOOK FIRST AND THEN... DID YOU HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT? WERE THERE THINGS WHERE SHE SAID, SO THAT'S WHERE YOU WERE IN TENTH GRADE WHEN YOU SAID YOU  WERE WITH YOUR COUSIN IN
WHEN I WAS WRITING IT, I JUST HAD TO BE OPEN AND NOT THINK  ABOUT WHO WOULD SAY WHAT BECAUSE MY TRUTH IS MY TRUTH, AND I LIVE MY LIFE TO TRY TO DO IT THE BEST  I CAN. I KNEW MY MOTHER WOULDN'T JUDGE ME TOO MUCH. CERTAIN THINGS, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO AROUND YOUR MOTHER, EVEN AS AN ADULT MAN, I  DON'T GET TOO MUCH PDA WITH A WOMAN AROUND MY MOTHER. I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DOING IT.
I DON'T LIKE LISTENING TO THE RADIO IN FRONT OF MY MOTHER. I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN A SONG AND I'M GOING TO BE LIKE...
YES, I MEAN, BUT SHE READ IT AND SAID, WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW  SOME OF THOSE THINGS HAPPENED. BUT OVERALL SHE WAS HAPPY I WAS ABLE TO BE HONEST. WHEN YOU WRITE SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YOU'RE DOING IT SO PEOPLE CAN BE INSPIRED AND BE  MOTIVATED, AND BECAUSE WE ALL ARE JUST PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY CAN SEE SOME OF MY STORIES AND BE LIKE, MAN, I WENT THROUGH THE SAME THING, AND I  CAN GO FULFILL MY DREAMS.
WELL, IT'S A GREAT STORY AND REALLY AN INTERESTING AND  WELL-WRITTEN ONE, AND IT'S REALLY NICE THE MEET YOU. I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.
CAN I SAY THANK YOU, BROTHER, FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME. JON JANUARY
Jon: HE'S GOING TO BE MY NEW MANAGER. I LOVE YOU. "ONE DAY IT WILL ALL MAKE SENSE." IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
