FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL SHOW, VERY SPECIAL GUEST TONIGHT. MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT SERGEANT FIRST CLASS LEROY PETRY WILL BE JOINING US ON THE  PROGRAM TONIGHT. WE'RE HONORED. WE BEGIN TONIGHT, OF COURSE, WITH THE LOOMING CRISIS. AS YOU KNOW, ON AUGUST 2nd, IF AMERICA FAILS TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING, WE DEFAULT ON OUR DEBT. PEOPLE LOSE THE CAPACITY TO LOVE. [LAUGHTER] AND ANIMALS LOSE THE CAPACITY TO LICK THEIR OWN GENITALS. THAT'S RIGHT. IF WE DON'T RAISE THE DEBT CEILING ON AUGUST 2nd, MAN WILL BE SENTENCED TO AN ETERNITY  OF LICKING OUR OWN PET'S GENITAL, BECAUSE WHAT WOULD WE REALLY DO? LET THEM DRY OUT? OF COURSE NOT. [LAUGHTER] SO HOPEFULLY OUR PRESIDENT, BARACK OBAMA, CAN IN ONE SWIFT ROOSEVELTIAN "WE HAVE NOTHING TO  FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF" MOMENT EASE THE AMERICAN PSYCHOI CAN.
CAN YOU TELL THE FOLKS AT HOME THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS THE SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS WILL  GO OUT ON AUGUST 3rd.
I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THOSE CHECKS GO OUT ON AUGUST 3rd IF  WE HAVEN'T RESOLVED THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THERE MAY SIMPLY NOT BE THE MONEY IN THE COFFERS TO DO IT.
Jon: [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER] WE NEED OUR CHECK! YOU KNOW WHAT, NO, NO, IT'S FINE. IT'S JUST OLE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW HOW THEY ARE. THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO JUST BLOW THAT MONEY ON MEDICINE AND HIPS. OF COURSE, OUR POLITICAL LEADERS SMART, DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS. THEY'VE BEEN IN NON-STOP MEETINGS TRYING TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING. HOW ARE THOSE MEETINGS GOING.
THE DEBT TALKS BLOW UP.
AN ANGRY PRESIDENT OBAMA WALKED OUT.
TEMPERATURES BEGAN RISING AFTER HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR SUGGESTED THE SIDES WERE  TOO FAR APART TO GET TO A DEAL. THAT'S WHEN THE PRESIDENT GOT VERY AGITATED. HE SAID, "DON'T CALL MY BLUFF, ERIC."
THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED, "I HAVE SHOWN ENORMOUS WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE."
MR. OBAMA THEN LEFT SAYING, "I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW."
Jon: OH, [BLEEPED]. OH, NO, HE DIDN'T. THE PRESIDENT STORMED OUT AND WAS LIKE, OKAY, TOMORROW THEN. [LAUGHTER] WHAT? THAT'S NOT STORMING OUT. THAT'S ENDING A MEETING BY SCHEDULING NEXT MEETING. AND I GOT TO SAY, IF THAT'S OBAMA MAD, THAT'S WEAK. HE'S STILL SO IN CONTROL. YOU GET THE SENSE IF HE WERE THE HULK, WHEN HE FELL HIS ANGER CAUSING THE TRANSFORMATION, HE  WOULD JUST EXCUSE HIMSELF TO CHANGE INTO A BIGGER SUIT, AS TO NOT NEEDLESSLY SHRED A PERFECTLY  GOOD OUTFIT. BUT THERE WAS ONE SENTENCE IN THAT NEWS REPORT THAT REALLY CAUGHT MY EAR. CAN WE HEAR THAT SENTENCE AGAIN?
HE SAID, "DON'T CALL MY BLUFF, ERIC."
Jon: COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE, "DON'T CALL MY BLUFF" KIND OF IMPLIES A GAME. THE IMMINENT POSSIBLE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OF OUR COUNTRY IS A CHIP THE PRESIDENT WILL PLAY OR  NOT PLAY GIVEN THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF HIS HAND. AND SECOND, I THINK WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING THAT HAND, YOU'RE NOT  SUPPOSED TO TELL THE OTHER GUY IT'S A BLUFF. [LAUGHTER] AND THIRDLY, BOY THE NAME ERIC REALLY TAKES THE URGENCY AND STEAM OUT OF AN ARGUMENT, DOESN'T IT? DON'T CALL MY BLUFF, ERIC. REALLY. IT'S NAME ONLY RIVALED BY CRAIG AND SUSAN. I WILL DESTROY YOU, CRAIG. [LAUGHTER] YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH, SUSAN. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT ISN'T ALONE IN ESCALATING THE RHETORIC IN THIS FIGHT. CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN HAD SOME HARSH WORDS OF HER OWN.
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE TO BE CONFRONTED WITH  PRIORITIES IN SPENDING BECAUSE HE HAS A LOT OF CHOOTS-PAH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU KNOW, I GOT A FEELING SAYING THE WORD "CHOOTS-PAH" IS GOING TO HURT  MORE GRANDMOTHERS THAN OBAMA CUTTING OFF THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY. I THINK BOTH PARTIES HAVE ALREADY LOST FLORIDA. "CHOOTS-PAH." SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S TALKING OUT OF HER CHOOTCHAS. HERE'S SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL LAYING OUT HIS PLAN FOR THE DEBT CRISIS.
I WOULD ADVOCATE THAT WE PASSES LEGISLATION GIVING THE PRESIDENT THE AUTHORITY TO  REQUEST OF US AN INCREASE IN THE DEBT CEILING THAT WOULD TAKE US PAST THE END OF HIS TERM.
Jon: [WHISPERING]: HEAP THREAT CAL.
THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL. THAT RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL IF PASSED WOULD THEN GO TO THE PRESIDENT. HE COULD SIGN IT OR HE COULD VETO IT.
Jon: WAIT. WHAT? SEE WHAT McCONNELL DID? HE CLEVERLY SPLIT THE SENATE'S RESPONSIBILITY IN TWO, ADVOCATING THE UNPOPULAR DOING IT PART TO THE PRESIDENT. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? IF RAISING THE DEBT LIMIT IS THE RESPONSIBLE CHOICE, WHY ARE YOU ALLOWING THE PRESIDENT TO DO IT  WHILE WIPING OFF ANY OF YOUR FINGER AND FOOTPRINTS?
THE REASON DEFAULT IS NO BETTER IDEA TODAY THAN WHEN NEWT GINGRICH TRIED IT IN 1995 IS IT  DESTROYS YOUR BRAND AND WOULD GIVE THE PRESIDENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO BLAME REPUBLICANS  FOR BAD ECONOMY. LOOK, HE OWNS THE ECONOMY. HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE ALMOST THREE YEARS NOW, AND WE REFUSE TO LET  HIM ENTICE US IN TO COOWNSHIP OF A BAD ECONOMY.
Jon: WE CAN HEAR YOU. [LAUGHTER] THE COUNTRY DEFALLING WOULD HURT THE REPUBLICAN BRAND. IT'S LIKE WHEN THE PINTO PEOPLE WERE UPSET THE EXPLODING GAS CANS WERE SINGEING THE HORSE MA DANAL. I FIND McCONNELL'S HONEST DISHONESTY REFRESHING. HE'S LAYING OUT THE CYNICAL STRATEGIC SUBTEXT THAT WE'RE NOT  SUPPOSED TO BE HEARING ABOUT. HE'S LIKE THAT GUY ON FOX WHO RUINED MAGIC FOR EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY FIVE YEARS AGO. HERE'S WHAT IT IS, KID. I DRUG FIVE RABBITS AND I STUFF THEM IN MY PANTDS. DON'T CRY, TIMMY. YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS. SO THE OUTSIDE OBSERVER, OUR LEADERS' INABILITY TO COMPROMISE ON EVEN THE SMALLEST THINGS  SEEMS INEXPLICABLE, BUT WATCH AS SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL EXPLAINS WASHINGTON MAGIC TO THE MUGGLES.
YOU SAID, "THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE WANT TO ACHIEVE IS FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA  TO BE A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT."
WELL, THAT IS TRUE. THAT'S MY SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL GOAL.
Jon: WOW. I CANNOT BELIEVE HE WOULD SAY THAT ON TELEVISION. HE HAS GOT A LOT OF, WHAT IS THAT CALLED, WHAT IS THAT...
