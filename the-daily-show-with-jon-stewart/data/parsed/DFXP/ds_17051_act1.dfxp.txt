JANUARY 26sth, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK  THIS IS DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOT A NICE SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. THE STAR OF THE NEW FILM "WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN" AND OBVIOUSLY NEXT WEEK IN  THE INTEREST OF FAIRNESS, WE'LL BRING ON KEVIN. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT HIS NEW FILM, REALLY? REALLY? WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THESE PAST FEW WEEKS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS. THERE'S A THIRD AND EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WHICH BY NOW  MUST BE FEELING SOMEWHAT IGNORED. THAT CHANGED TONIGHT WITH OUR BRAND-NEW SEGMENT A LOVE SUPREME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SORRY. WE DIDN'T FORGET ABOUT YOU SUPREME COURT BABY. WHY DON'T YOU CHANGE INTO SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE. ACTUALLY, YOU WEAR ROBES, I MEAN, YEAH. I GUESS YOU COULD MAKE THE PUBLIC MORE PLUSH BUT YOU PROBABLY JUST WEARING A SNUGGIE. ANY WAY, THE POINT IS THIS. THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN HEARING SOME NEW CASES, LET'S CHECK IN.
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT IS NOW CONSIDERING A CHALLENGE TO GOVERNMENT RULES BARRING  CURSING AND NUDITY ON THE MAJOR NETWORKS.
RIGHT NOW PROFANITY AND WARDROBE MALFUNCTIONS CAN GET BROADCASTERS SLAPPED  WITH SIX FIGURE FINES. THE NETWORKS INCLUDING ABC ARGUE IN THIS DAY AND AGE THAT'S JUST NOT FAIR.
(LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT IS SOME FRESH MELLON. THAT PERSON IS IN SHAPE. BUT HERE'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. ABC GOT FINED FOR AIRING THAT KIND OF SEXY TIME FOOTAGE ON ONE OF THEIR  PRIME TIME SHOWS BUT IT'S OKAY FOR ABC NEWS TO RUN THAT SAME SEXY TIME FOOTAGE  IN THE EVENING BECAUSE THEY'RE REPORTING ON THE FINE? THAT DOESN'T MAKE-- WHATEVER WEIRD WORKS AROUND AND LOOPHOLES ARE WE DEALING WITH HERE.
MOST OF THE TELEVISION PROGRAMS THAT COME INTO AMERICAN HOMES ARE  UNREGULATED, THAT INCLUDES WHAT IS ON THE CABLE NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET.
Jon: OH CABLE PROGRAMS LIKE MINE ARE UNREGULATED. WHY CAN'T I SAY [BLEEP]. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I DID SAY IT. YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE I DID SAY IT. I DON'T WATCH THIS SHOW SO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY BLEEPED IT OR ALLOWED ME TO JUST SAY  [BLEEP]. WELL, IF ANYONE CAN MAKE SENSE OF WHAT APPEAR TO BE ARBITRARY AND ARCHAIC DISTINCTIONS OF PROFANITY  AND NUDITY IT'S THE NINE BEROBED BIG BRAINS OF THE SUPREME COURT. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, YOU'RE THE CHIEF JUSTICE, CLEARLY THAT MEANS THE SMARTEST, WHAT SAY YOU.
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND, WHICH HAVE DEMONSTRATED I THINK THAT THE CONTEXT MATTERS. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT INCLUDING CHILDREN. WHEN THEY HEAR A BAD WORD WHEN SOMEONE HITS THEIR THUMB WAY HAMMER THEY  UNDERSTAND THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN HAVING AN ADULT STAND IN NORMAL CONVERSATION AND  USE THE WORD.
Jon: THAT IS SO TRUE. AND I GUESS IT EXPLAINS THAT GREAT PBS SHOW THIS OLD  [BLEEP] HOUSE. IT'S-- LOOK AT THAT GUY. IS THAT THE NEW-- THAT'S THE NEW HOST. IT'S AN INTERESTING F SOMEWHAT ONEROUS LOOPHOLE, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME TRY IT. [BLEEP], NO. OH [BLEEP]-- DID THAT GET THROUGH. (APPLAUSE) THAT WAS DUMB OF ME. SO I GUESS THAT THERE ARE DISTINCTIONS OF WHEN YOU CAN USE OBSCENE LANGUAGE. LET'S GET BACK TO SEXY TIME PICTURES. WHEN CAN NETWORKS AIR THOSE AND BY THE WAY AS AN ADDED LAYER OF IRONY TO THE  CENSORSHIP CASE, WE DON'T HAVE ACTUAL FOOTAGE OF THE SUPREME COURT ARGUMENT  BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT DON'T ALLOW NO CAMERAS. I ASSUME SO THEY CAN GET IN THEIR MOST FAVORITE JUDGING POSITIONS. OH, OH. WOW. YES, HMMMM, I MEAN LET ME SAY THIS, HERE YE HERE YE, ALL RISE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ANYWAY, SORRY. BY THE WAY I'M SURE AT HOME THAT WAS COVERED UP. I'M HOPING. JUSTICE STEVEN BRYER DISCUSSES WHY EVEN GRANTING SOME SEXY TIME PICTURE EXCEPTIONS CAN GET TRICKY  LIKE THE CASE REGARDING THE "NYPD BLUE" EPISODE FEATURING FEMALE NUDITY.
YOU RAN AT YOUR CLIENT AFTER 10:00 ON BOTH COASTS AND THEY CHOOSE TO RUN IT AT  9:00 FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON IN THE MIDWEST. MAYBE THEY THOUGHT, I-- WHATEVER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YEAH, I MEAN COY DEFINITELY SEE SIDE BUTT FROM CIRKA 1994 AT 10:00 BUT 9:00 P.M.? WHAT AM I ROMAN POLANSKI OVER HERE? I'M TRYING TO EAT DINNER, DRAPE YOUR FLANKS, WOMAN. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GLAD SOMEONE'S OUT THERE PROTECTING AMERICA'S  DELICATE SENSIBILITY PRE10 P.M. BECAUSE IF THOSE TYPES OF BARELY CLOTHED IMAGES WERE TO IL FILL-- INFILTRATE THE  AIRWAVES WE NOT HAVE ROOM FOR THE MORE WHOLESOME FAIR THAT DOES AIR AT 9:00 P.M. IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY  [BLEEP] NIGHT AS WE SPEAK ON BROADCAST NETWORK'S TELEVISION. AND BY THE WAY I'M GOING SHOW IT TO YOU RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S 11:00 ON A  BASIC CABLE PROGRAM AND I'M STILL GOING TO WARN YOU ABOUT IT.
SHE SODOMIZED TWO MEN AND SEARED THEIR CHEST WITH A COAT HANGAR.
SODOMIZED WITH A HAVE A LYNN BOW.
SODOMIZED WITH A TIRE IRON.
WHO WOULD WANT TO CUT YOUR PENIS OFF?
AMY FIEDLER, 22 YEARS OLD A MEMBER OF SIGMA AT THE TIMEA DELTA.
GET OUT OF HERE.
I DO THINK THERE WAS A REASON THAT THE KILLER SODOMIZED YOUR HUSBAND WITH A BANANA? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: BECAUSE THE STORE WAS OUT OF PAPAYAS? (LAUGHTER) TO BE FAIR I THINK THAT LAST PART ONLY AIRED AT 9:00 P.M. IN THE MIDWEST, THE HEARTLAND. SO BUT IT'S NOT ALL DIRTY TALK AND SEXY TIME AT THE SUPREME COURT THEY ARE ALSO  DABBLING IN WEIGHTIER FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES SUCH AS.
IS THERE SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WAY A CHURCH MANAGINGS ITS EMPLOYEES THAT THE  GOVERNMENT CAN'T TOUCH, AND A WOMAN WHO WAS A TEACHER AT A LUTHERAN SCHOOL IN  MICHIGAN DEVELOPED A DISEASE KNOWN AS NARCOLEPSY WHICH CAUSED ANOTHER FALL INTO  PERIODS OF DEEP SLEEP. SO SHE LEFT FOR TREATMENT. WHEN THEY CAME BACK THE CHURCH SAID SORRY, WE DON'T HAVE ANY OPENINGS.
Jon: MOST PLACES CAN'T FIRE SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NARCOLEPSY, THE  AMERICAN WITH DISABILITIES ACT BUT CAN A CHURCH. IT'S ON. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM V THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT. THERE IS ONLY THREE WAYS IT CAN GO. EITHER 5-4 OR 4-5 OR MAYBE 4 AND A HALF, 4 AND A HALF.
WE HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS FOUR OUT OF THE SUPREME COURT IN A UNANIMOUS  DECISION THE JUSTICES RULED THAT A TEACHER FIRED FOR A DISABILITY FROM A RELIGIOUS  SCHOOL CANNOT SUE.
9-0 WITH THE COURT LIB RAMS JOINING THE CONSERVATIVES. NONE OF THE LIBERALS EVEN WROTE SEPARATELY TO SAY A PEEP ABOUT THIS DECISION. THEY OBVIOUSLY AGREED IN IT SO MUCH.
WHOA, 9-0. THESE JUDGES WERE 8-1 ON WHETHER WORK SUKD OR NOT. GINSBURG IS ALL IT WAS LIKE A MODERN DAY BOSUM BUDDY. IT'S LIKE PUSY TIMES 2, WE NEED THESE SHOWS. MORE MORE ON THE RELIGIOUS ENG, EXEMPTION STORY WE GO TO AASIF MANDVI. WHAT IS THE REACTION TO THIS WHAT IS THE REACTION TO THIS DECISION.
WELL, JON, BIG WINNERS HERE ARE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ADVOCATES. THEY ARE THRILLED!
THAT'S THEIR RELIGIOUS DECISION. RESPECT THEIR RELIGION AND RESPECT THE --
THE DETERMINATION RELIGIOUS LIBERTY TRUMPS ALL. HANDS-OFF.
WOW.
SO BIG HALLELUJAH WENT UP ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
YOU HEAR THAT, JON. HALL A LIEU LA.
Jon: YOU SEEM PRETTY CHIPPER YOURSELF, AASIF.
CHIPPER NO, I'M NOT CHIPPER.
Jon: ARE YOU, ARE YOU SMILING.
WELL, I JUST FIND TIN DIEGO-- INTRIGUING THAT THE NINE JUSTICES IN THEIR  WISDOM UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THAT RELIGIOUS LAW CAN OVERRIDE CIVIL LAW, WHETHER  IT'S A LUTHERAN ORR ABINICAL COUNCIL OR THE IMAM OF A MOSQUE.
Jon: WLOE, I SEE WHERE YOU ARE GOING, NO, NO, MY FRIEND, FORGET IT.
WHAT DID YOU SAY.
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING THIS DECISION PAVES THE WAY FOR THE SHARIA LAW HERE IN  AMERICA WITH THE HALLA PART.
I'M JUST SAYING, FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THIS MOSS INCOME FLORIDA WHERE A JUDGE  TRIED TO USE SHARIA LAW TO SOLVE A DISPUTE BETWEEN MUSLIMS.
Jon: TOTALLY DIFFERENT SITUATION.
WHY?
Jon: YOU MUSLIM --
MUSLIMS ARE SCARY.
SO YOU SAY LUTHERANS CAN USE THE CHURCH TO SOLVE THEIR DISPUTES BUT A MOSQUE  CAN'T USE THEIR RELIGIOUS LAW.
Jon: NO, NO, AASIF, NO-- YES.
WHY?
Jon: LUTHERANS ARE VERY EASY GOING. THEY CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS, WEAR SWEATER VEST, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THEY LOVE PARK. I JUST THINK THAT THE SCARIEST LUTHERAN THEY ONLY HAVE IS WILLIAM H. MACY WHO'S AWESOME.
YEAH, YEAH, NOW. BUT BY NOW HE'S 95 FEET FROM THE CATHEDRAL DOOR, MARTIN LUTHER PARTS EUROPE IN A  CENTURY OF BLOODY RELIGIOUS WAR AND ALL WE HAD WAS ALL HE HAD WAS A HAMMER AND  STATIONERY, JUST IMAGINE WHAT THEY WILL DO WITH THE FULL FORCE OF THE SUPREME COURT BEHIND THEM. TODAY IT'S FIRING TEACHERS. TOMORROW IT IS FORCING YOUR KIDS TO LISTEN PRAYERIE HOME COMPANION IN SCHOOLS. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: NEVER GOING HAPPEN. THANK YOU, AASIF.
MARK MY WORD
