(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, IT WAS REALLY NO SURPRISE THAT THE TEA PARTY WAS VOCAL LAST NIGHT. BUT WHAT WAS SURPRISING WAS EVEN PARTY DARLING RICK PERRY FACED THEIR OCCASIONAL WRATH, ESPECIALLY ON IMMIGRATION ISSUES.
IF YOU ARE WORKING AND PURSUING CITIZENSHIP IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, YOU PAY IN-STATE  TUITION THERE. NO MATTER HOW YOU GOT INTO THAT STATE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF F YOUR PARENTS BROUGHT YOU THERE  OR WHAT HAVE YOU. (BOOS) AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE STATE OF TEXAS AND I'M PROUD.
Jon: BOO! PUT THEM IN A COMA AND KILL THEM! (LAUGHTER) WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT POKER, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) WITH MORE REACTION TO THIS WITH TURN TO SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AL MADRIGAL WHO  WAS AT LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AL, NICE TO SEE YOU. WHAT ARE YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THESE GUYS. ALL RIGHT, JON, THAT BOOED RICK PERRY. I GET THAT THEY'RE NOT INTO ROMNEY, BUT PER INDUSTRY THE GUY EXECUTED 234 PEOPLE, GUNNED DOWN  A COYOTE ON HIS MORNING JOG! (LAUGHTER) BUT HE MENTIONS MEXICANS AND COLLEGE IN THE SAME SENTENCE AND  SUDDENLY HE'S TOO SOFT FOR THEM? (LAUGHTER) THIS IS A TOUGH CROWD.
Jon: BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S THIS THE TEA PARTY'S IDEALS  ARE LARGER THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL.
WHAT IDEALS? I MEAN... (LAUGHTER). THE PARTY THAT STARTED OUT FEARING DEATH PANELS HAS BECOME ONE! (LAUGHTER) IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. THIS IS FLORIDA. HALF THE POPULATION IS IN A COMA. (LAUGHTER) I JUST REALLY DON'T THINK THAT ANY CANDIDATE WILL EVER BE GOOD ENOUGH.
Jon: WELL, SOMEONE WILL COME ALONG. THAT'S HOW THESE TYPES OF POLITICS GO. ANOTHER RONALD REAGAN WHO CAN...
WHOA? WHAT? ARE YOU NUTS? RONALD REAGAN WAS A HOLLYWOOD COMMIE WHO RAISED TAXES, GREW GOVERNMENT AND GAVE AMNESTY TO  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. THAT POOR SON OF A BITCH WOULD GET EATEN ALIVE BY THIS CROWD. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I WILL GO AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT NO HUMAN BEING LIVING, DEAD, OR  FICTIONAL WOULD EVER SATISFY THE TEA PARTY.
Jon: THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE, AL. IT'S NOT A...
YOU WANT TO GO? YOU WANT TO GO, OLD MAN? ALL RIGHT, BRING IT.
Jon: YOU WANT KNOW BRING IT?
BRING IT.
Jon: YOU WANT KNOW BRING IT?
BRING IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: ALL RIGHT, THEY LOVE THE FOUNDING FATHERS. THOMAS JEFFERSON.
(LAUGHS) THAT'S YOU BRINGING IT. THE MAN CUT UP HIS BIBLE, LOVED THE FRENCH AND HAD A WELL-DOCUMENTED CASE OF JUNGLE FEVER. (LAUGHTER) TRY AGAIN.
Jon: OKAY, FICTIONAL, RIGHT? SUPERMAN. (LAUGHTER)
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: COME ON! THAT'S RIDICULOUS! HERE'S SOMEONE WHO COULD LEAD THE TEA PARTY. OPTIMUS PRIME!
HE ACCEPTED THE AUTO INDUSTRY BAILOUT!
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THE TERMINATOR. A MACHINE THAT TOOK AWAY GOOD-PAYING AMERICAN ASSASSIN JOBS! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WOW. YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT. I MEAN, EVEN JESUS FED THE POOR BY REDISTRIBUTING LOAVESES AND OFFICIALS.
WAIT, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. DID YOU JUST DISJESUS? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NO, I WAS SAYING FROM AN IDEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE THAT THEY MIGHT...
JON, IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED FROM THIS  DEBATE-- AND I QUOTE-- "BOO! BOO! LET HIM DIE! LET HIM DIE!"
Jon: WE'LL BE
