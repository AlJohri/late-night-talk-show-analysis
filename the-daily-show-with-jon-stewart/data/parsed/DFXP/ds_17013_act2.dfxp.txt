(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW LAST WEEK REPRESENTATIVE ERIC CANTOR ANNOUNCED THAT IN 2012  THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE IN SESSION A SCANT 109 DAYS. BUT HOW WILL THEY ACCOMPLISH NOTHING IN SUCH A SHORT TIME? (LAUGHTER) OUR OWN WYATT CENAC HAS SOME OF THE ANSWERS.
WE ALL KNOW THE STORY ABOUT HOW MY FRIEND BECAME A LAW. ♪ I'M JUST A LAW... ♪
SHUT UP! GO AWAY. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BILLS THAT END UP OVER THERE? WHAT'S THEIR STORY? (ECHOING) FORMER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN KATHY DOLL KEMPER WITNESSED THE  DEATH OF HER BILL FIRSTHAND. H.R. 3472 IS A BILL I AUTHORED THAT PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO HELP ENCOURAGE THEM TO  MAKE HEALTHIER LIFE-STYLE CHOICES.
Reporter: BASICALLY, IF YOU EXERCISE YOU GET A REDUCTION ON YOUR HEALTH CARE PREMIUM. DEMOCRATS LIKED IT AS PREVENTATIVE CARE. REPUBLICANS LIKED ITS LOW COST. AND REPRESENTATIVE AARON SCHECK LIKED IT BECAUSE "JESUS! LOOK AT THOSE YABS! THEY SHOULD REFUND HIS WHOLE PREMIUM!" BUT THE BILL NEVER MADE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE.
IT ENDED UP BEING VERY CONTROVERSIAL AND WITHIN A WEEK THE BILL WAS PRETTY MUCH DEAD.
IT WAS A STORY THAT WAS ALL TOO FAMILIAR. SO A WEEK'S TIME THE BILL GETS KILLED BY SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS? THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY? THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY?
THE BILL WAS OPPOSED BY OUTSIDE INTEREST GROUPS SUCH AS THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION, AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION.
WHAT THE (BLEEP)? AND SHOCKINGLY, THESE ORGANIZATIONS WERE ALL WORKING TOGETHER TO KILL THE BILL.
THE FLURRY OF ACTIVITY OVER A WEEK TO TEN DAYS WAS VERY INTENSE. THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION, AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION AND OTHER SIMILAR TYPE GROUPS. THEY SAID THEY'RE NOT IN FAVOR OF THIS LEGISLATION.
FOR EACH HOUR OF REGULAR, VIGOROUS EXERCISE, YOU COULD GAIN TWO HOURS OF LIFE EXPECTANCY.
THE PEOPLE WHO ENCOURAGED THAT ARE THE SAME ONES WHO OPPOSED THIS BILL?
THEIR ARGUMENT WAS THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT  CAN'T MAKE LIFE-STYLE CHANGES TO HAVE A HEALTHIER LIFE. WHETHER THEY CAN'T CHANGE THEIR DIET OR THEY CAN'T CHANGE THEIR EXERCISE LEVEL.
AND I'VE WATCHED ENOUGH EPISODES OF "BIGGEST LOSER" TO  KNOW THAT ANYONE CAN BE HEALTHY.
PUKE OR DIE! KEEP WALKING!
SHE SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR THE HELP OF LOBBYISTS LIKE SCOTT.
YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM WHY THE LEGISLATION IS IN THEIR SELF-INTEREST. SOMETIMES THAT'S A FINANCIAL CALCULATION. AS GENERAL PROPOSITION, GIVE EVERYBODY A TASTE OF THE BUSINESS IS A GOOD IDEA.
SO IT'S LIKE THAT MAFIA?
THAT'S RIGHT.
PRETEND I'M THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION WHAT DID SHE NEED TO SAY?
YOU'RE A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH CHARITY, YOU'RE ALL ABOUT GOOD  HABITS AND WELLNESS AND EXERCISE. THAT'S WHAT MY LEGISLATION IS ABOUT. WORK WITH ME ON IT AND WE'LL GET THIS THING PASSED.
GET THE (BLEEP) OUT OF MY OFFICE! YES, WITHOUT MANDATES, GIVEBACKS OR RIDERS TO THESE GROUPS, H.R. 342 WAS DEAD ON ARRIVAL. WE TRIED TO CONTACT THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY BUT THEY TURNED US DOUBT.
THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CONTACT MED KNOWING I WAS COMING  ON THIS SHOW WONDERING WHETHER I WAS REALLY GOING TO GO THROUGH WITH IT AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS. THEY WERE TRYING TO CONVINCE ME NOT TO DO THIS INTERVIEW.
HOLY CRAP. THAT'S LIKE SOME "60 MINUTES" (BLEEP). I'M LIKE THE NEW ED BRADLEY! EAT A (BLEEP), SCOTT PELLEY! AFTER THIS LEGISLATION FELL THROUGH IN 2009, DOLL KEMPER LOST HER SEAT AND IT'S NO WONDER. SHE LEARNED A LESSON NO ONE ELSE SHOULD HAVE TO LEARN: DENTS ME WITH BIG CANCER. SOMETHING I REALIZED THE NEXT MORNING. TUMORS! (SCREAMING)
