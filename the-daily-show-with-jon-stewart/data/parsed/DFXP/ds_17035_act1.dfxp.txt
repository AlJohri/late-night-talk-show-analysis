CAPTIONS READY TO GO CAPTIONS READY TO GO
DECEMBER 14, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THANKS. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. JON STEWART. GOT A GREAT SHOW. I APOLOGIZE. VERY QUICKLY, VERY QUICKLY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I'M COMPLETING  A LETTER I'M WRITING TO THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER] THE HANGOVER REMEDY FOR U.S.O. VOLUNTEERS. LISTEN, OUR GUESS TONIGHT, WAREHOUSE DIRECTOR OF POLICY MELODY BARNES. WE HERE AT "THE DAILY SHOW" REALIZE POLITICS TAKES STEADFASTNESS AND THE EXCESSIVE  BUZZ OF THE NORTHERN AMERICAN DOUCHE FLY. [LAUGHTER] THERE TO RED KYLE AND POKE FUN AT YOUR EVERY MOVE AND GESTURE. COLBERT. BUT THERE'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN COURAGE AND AUDACITY, AND SEVERAL PUBLIC FIGURES HAVE  RECENTLY CROSSED IT. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW SEGMENT, "HOLY [BLEEPED], YOU GOT SOME HUGE, HAIRY, MOTHER  [BLEEPED] BALLS ON YOU" BROUGHT TO YOU BY LOWE'S HARDWARE, THE  ONE-STOP HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOP THAT LEGALLY CAN'T PREVENT US FROM PRETENDING THEY SPONSORED  OUR BALLS SEGMENT. [LAUGHTER] WE THINK. WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THAT THAT'S TRUE. IS THAT TRUE? I DON'T EVEN KNOW. FIRST UP, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HERMAN CAIN, WHILE HE WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE HE  CAPTURED THE NATION'S HEART WITH HIS COMMAND OF FOREIGN POLICY.
WHEN THEY ASKED ME WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF UZBEKI-BEKI-STAN-STAN, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO SAY I DON'T KNOW. >>OKAY. LIBYA. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I KNOW THAT LOOK. THAT LOOK SAYS, WHERE IS THE FIRE ALARM MANY THIS ROOM? [LAUGHTER] AND CAN I PULL IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED. WELL, THIS WEEK CAIN SAT DOWN WITH BARBARA WALTERS AS ONE OF HER TEN MOST FASCINATING PEOPLE  OF 2011, BY THE WAY, VERY IMPRESSIVE THAT WALTERS ALWAYS LANDS ALL TEN OF THE YEAR'S MOST  FASCINATING PEOPLE.
WHAT KIND OF CABINET POSITION WOULD YOU LIKE IF IT WERE POSSIBLE.
WE'RE SPEAKING TOTALLY, TOTALLY HYPE TET CAL, RIGHT?
Jon: NO, HERMAN CAIN, THIS IS YOUR JOB INTERVIEW FOR A CABINET POSITION.
WHAT KIND OF CABINET POSITION MIGHT YOU LIKE IF IT WERE POSSIBLE?
WE ARE SPEAKING TOTALLY, TOTALLY HYPOTHETICAL, RIGHT?
YES. OKAY.
TOTALLY, TOTALLY HYPOTHETICAL.
YES.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.
WHAT? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THAT WAS SO BALLSY, THAT WAS SO BALLSY IT MADE BARBARA WALTERS DO A REPORTER'S EQUIVALENT OF A SPIT TAKE. THE LADY HAS BEEN ON TV SINCE TV STARTED. [LAUGHTER] AND SHE HAS NEVER REACTED VISCERALLY LIKE THAT TO A STATEMENT LIKE THIS. SHE'S FACED DOWN CRAZY BULLSHIT FROM DICTATORS, FROM PRESIDENT, FROM MOGULS AND MOVIE STARS. SHERRY SHEPHERD TOLD HER SHE WASN'T SURE IF THE WORLD WAS ROUND AND DIDN'T GET A WHAT. LAST WEEK SYRIAN DICTATOR ASSAD, WHO LAUNCHED A MURDEROUS CRACKDOWN ON HIS OWN PEOPLE TOLD BARBARA WALTERS THIS.
WE DON'T KILL OUR OWN PEOPLE. NOBODY KILLS... NO GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD KILLS ITS PEOPLE UNLESS IT'S LED BY A CRAZY PERSON. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT, THAT DIDN'T GET A "WHAT?" BARBARA WALTERS WAS ABLE TO  SUPPRESS HER INCREDIT DUALITY IN ALL THOSE SITUATION, BUT FIVE MINUTES WITH HERMAN CAIN.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE?
WHAT?
Jon: IT LITERALLY BLEW HER MIND. LOOK AT HER EARS. YOU CAN SEE THERE'S BLOOD COMING OUT OF HER EARS. [LAUGHTER] HE GAVE THE WOMAN AN ANEURYSM. OH, SADLY WE HAVE BIGGER BALLS TO FRY. BALLS THAT BELONG TO ONE WILLARD MITT ROMNEY, WHO IS FACING A BIT OF AN UPHILL BATTLE IN HIS RACE  TO BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. BY "UPHILL BATTLE" I MEAN NOBODY SEEMS THE WANT TO VOTE FOR HIM, SO HE'S DECIDED ON A BALLSY NEW TACT.
HE'S GOING AFTER GINGRICH, QUESTIONING HIS CONSERVATIVE YES DEN,S.
Jon: ROMNEY IS QUESTIONING GINGRICH'S CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALS. BARBARA?
WHAT?
Jon: THIS IS WHAT ROMNEY, THE FORMER NOT-PRO-LIFE, PRO-GAY GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS SAYS ABOUT NEWT GINGRICH'S  CONSISTENCY OF THOUGHT.
THE NUMBER OF TIMES HE HAS MOVED FROM ONE SPOT TO ANOTHER HAS BEEN REMARKABLE. I THINK HE HAS SHOWN A LEVEL OF UNRELIABILITY AS A CONSERVATIVE LEADER TODAY.
Jon: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU. THAT'S THE KIND OF SACK THAT SANTA WOULD LOOK AT AND GO, WE'RE GOING TO NEED A BIGGER SLED. BY THE WAY, ROMNEY WASN'T JUST SAYING GINGRICH WAS INCONSISTENT, HE WAS  SPECIFICALLY SAYING GINGRICH WASN'T CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH. ROMNEY, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE A NOT IDEALOGICALLY PURE ENOUGH CONSERVATIVE, AND CAN YOU FRAME  IT AS A POSITIVE IN 2002?
I THINK PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT I'M NOT A PARTISAN REPUBLICAN, THAT I'M SOMEONE WHO IS MODERATE AND THAT MIGHT VIEWS ARE PROGRESSIVE.
Jon: AND BY "PROGRESSIVE," I MEAN MY VIEWS WILL PROGRESS IN  ANY DIRECTION NECESSARY. SERIOUSLY. SERIOUSLY. YOU'RE THE GUY WHO IS SO FAR TO THE LEFT IN HIS OWN PARTY THAT  THIS AFTERNOON FOX NEWS, THIS IS TRUE, ACCIDENTALLY USED A PHOTO OF BARACK OBAMA WHERE A PICTURE  OF YOU SHOULD GO. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THAT'S NOT CAUSE YOU GUYS LOOK ALIKE, WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR BALLER OF THE WEEK. RECALL THAT LAST WEEK A SUPERRER CHARGED, FULLY LOADED, SHIFT ON FLY, ROBO-CONTROLLED SPY DRONES  OF THE FUTURE RAN OUT OF BATTERIES OVER IRAN, THEREBY FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF AN  EVIL MILITANT REGIME, AND SINCE THEN THEIR MILITARY HAS BEEN  [BLEEPED] BANGING OUR BABY IN AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER. GUESS WHAT, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS A MESSAGE FOR IRAN.
WITH RESPECT TO THE DRONE INSIDE OF IRAN, WE HAVE ASKED FOR IT BACK. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU ASKED FOR IT BACK. YOU WERE SPYING ON THEM VIA A DRONE. YOU'RE ACTING LIKE WE RENT THEM SEASON ONE OF "THE WIRE."  YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO NEED THAT BACK. IT TAKES GIANT BALLS TO ASK FOR YOUR SPY DRONE BACK. I'D BE LIKE, HEY, MAN, I'M SORRY, IS THIS BILL? I WAS JUST OVER AT YOUR HOUSE BANGING YOUR WIFE, AND I THINK I LEFT MY SHOES THERE. YOU MIND FEDEXING THOSE BAD BOYS? YEAH, IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE SHOE, I GOT ORTHODICS IN THEM. HELLO? HELLO. SO HOW DID IRAN RESPOND?
IRAN HAS BASICALLY SAID FORGET ABOUT IT. THE DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE IRANIAN ARMED FORCES SAID, LOOK, NOBODY LIKES SPY DRONES IN ITS TERRITORY, AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T GIVE THEM BACK, NO NATION  WOULD DO THAT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU FLUM MOCKED IRAN, A COUNTRY THAT DENIES THE HOLOCAUST AND THE EXISTENCE OF GAY PEOPLE WITHIN ITS BORDERS. THEY HEARD YOUR PROPOSAL AND SAID, OBVIOUSLY I'M LOOSELY TRANSLATING FROM THE FARSI HERE.
WHAT?
THAT'S WHY BARACK OBAMA IS THE RECIPIENT OF THE INAUGURAL LOWE'S
