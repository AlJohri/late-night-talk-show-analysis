(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. AS MANY OF YOU WATCH THE PROGRAM, I'M A BIT OF A NEWS CONNOISSEUR. MY OFFICE IS WIRED. GOT 16 T.V.s ALL SIMULTANEOUSLY TUNED TO NEWS CHANNELS, EIGHT HIGH SPEED WI-FI HOT SPOTS. GOT A POWER GLOVE HOOKED UP TO ONE OF THEM MINORITY REPORT SCREENS SO I CAN SLIDE FOOTAGE  AROUND IN REALTIME. THAT'S HOW WE MAKE THE MONTAGES. (LAUGHTER) POINT IS, I'VE SEEN MY SHARE OF CRAZY (BLEEP) ON T.V. MONDAY NIGHT, THOUGH, BRIAN WILLIAMS NEW SHOW, THE INSANITY BAR WAS RAISED. BOB COSTAS GETS A PHONE CALL FROM FORMER PENN STATE COACH AND ACCUSED CHILD RAPIST JERRY SANDUSKY. NOW, I'M NO LAWYER, BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WHEN YOU'RE ACCUSED OF ONE  OF THE MOST HEINOUS CRIMES IMAGINABLE YOU MAY NOT WANT TO LITERALLY PHONE IN YOUR DEFENSE.   (LAUGHTER) ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.
ARE YOU SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO YOUNG BOYS? TO UNDERAGE BOYS?
AM I SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO UNDERAGE BOYS?
Jon: DID YOU JUST REPEAT THE QUESTION? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT QUESTION WAS COMING BUT EVERYONE  KNOWS THE ONLY TIME YOU REPEAT A QUESTION IS WHEN YOU'RE GUILTY! (LAUGHTER) "DID YOU USE MY ELECTRIC RAZOR TO SHAVE YOUR PUBES?"  "DID I USE YOUR ELECTRIC RAZOR TO SHAVE MY PUBES?" (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE ABOUT TO LIE! I DON'T HAVE TO BE A LAWYER TO KNOW THAT A LIE IS COMING. I'VE LIED BEFORE. SO I POE WHAT YOU DO BEFORE YOU LIE! (LAUGHS)
AM I SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO UNDERAGE BOYS? SEXUALLY ATTRACTED? YOU KNOW, I ENJOY YOUNG PEOPLE. I LOVE TO BE AROUND THEM. I... I... BUT NO. I'M NOT SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO YOUNG BOYS. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: YOU CAN'T EVEN BRING YOURSELF TO LIE EMPHATICALLY! GOOD GOD NO! SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO! I'M NOT! IT'S LIKE IN THAT PHONE CONVERSATION YOU'RE ACTUALLY FIGHTING THE URGE TO COME CLEAN! AND IF YOU WEREN'T PREPARED FOR THAT QUESTION, IT WASN'T GOING TO GET EASIER.
WHAT ABOUT MIKE McQUEARY, THE GRAD ASSISTANT WHO IN 2002 WALKED INTO THE SHOWER WHERE HE SAYS IN SPECIFIC DETAIL THAT YOU  WERE FORCIBLY RAPING A BOY WHO APPEARED TO BE TEN OR 11 YEARS OLD.
WE WERE SHOWERING AND HORSING AROUND AND HE ACTUALLY TURNED ALL THE SHOWERS ON AND WAS  ACTUALLY SLIDING ACROSS THE FLOOR AND WE WERE, AS I RECALL, POSSIBLY LIKE SNAP AGO TOWEL, HORSE PLAY. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, GOOD ON BOB COSTAS, NICE JOB. SECOND OF ALL, HORSEPLAY? ARE YOU (BLEEP)ING KIDDING US? HORSEPLAY? (APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW, HORSEPLAY...... HORSEPLAY IS WRESTLING YOUR FRIEND OUT OF A PILLOW FORT. THROWING YOUR NEPHEW INTO THE POOL, VARIOUS OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD BE NEVER MISTAKEN FOR RAPE. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING, WHERE THE HELL IS  SANDUSKY'S LAWYER WHILE HE'S SAYING ALL THIS? HE'S SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO BOB COSTAS! (AUDIENCE REACTS)
WOULD YOU ALLOW YOUR OWN CHILDREN TO BE ALONE WITH YOUR CLIENT?
ABSOLUTELY. I... I BELIEVE IN JERRY'S INNOCENCE. QUITE HONESTLY, BOB, THAT'S WHY I'M INVOLVED IN THE CASE.
Jon: RIGHT, YOU'D LEAVE YOUR KIDS ALONE WITH JERRY SANDUSKY. ARE THE KIDS YOU WOULD LEAVE ALONE WITH THEM ANY OF THE KIDS YOU HAD WHEN YOU IMPREGNATE ADD  TEENAGED CLIENT IN 1996? (AUDIENCE REACTS) WHEN YOU WERE AT THE TIME 49 YEARS OLD? WHAT KIND OF CREEPY GUY CLUB DO YOU BOTH BELONG TO? (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT A LAWYER HERE, BUT, AGAIN... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IF YOU'RE ACCUSED OF SEX WITH MINORS, FORCIBLE SEX, MAYBE YOUR  CRITERIA FOR FINDING A DEFENSE LAWYER SHOULDN'T BE "ALSO HAS  ISSUES WITH SEXUAL BOUNDARIES." (LAUGHTER) SANDUSKY, YOU'RE A DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COORDINATE A BETTER DEFENSE. (LAUGHTER) AND YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE IT 20 YEARS AGO. IT'S EASY, YOU COULD HAVE CALLED THE PREVENT DEFENSE. YOU KNOW, OR THE PREVENT-ME DEFENSE. WHEN THE BALL SNAPS PULL ALL YOUR (BLEEP)ING LINEMEN AND SEND EVERYBODY TO PREVENT YOU FROM  MOVING 50 YARDS WITHIN A KID! DONE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT
