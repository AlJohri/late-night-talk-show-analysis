Jon: WELCOME BACK. DEM -- CERTAINLY OCTOBER SEE. YOU CONDITION SPELL IT WITHOUT ALMOST SPELLING CRAZY. AND LATELY IT'S BUSTING OUT ALL OVER. MOST RECENTLY EGYPT, THEIR UPCOMING ELECTION IS THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW SEGMENT. WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE LOOKED THAT UP BUT WE'RE A LITTLE LAZY. WICK PEDESTRIANIA, SOMETHING. EGYPT IS NOW SIX WOKES AWAY FROM ITS NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. OF COURSE THE WINNER OF THE PREVIOUS FIVE IS NOT RUNNING THIS YEAR DUE TO THE  TECHNICALITY OF HAVING BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE COUNTRY BY HIS OWN PEOPLE. ONE OF THE AFFECTS OF THE ARAB SPRING AS WE WERE PROMISED FOR SO LONG. DEMOCRACY IS FINALLY FLOWERING IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD. FOR AMERICA FUNNY STEER, ONE LITTLE ISSUE.
AS EGYPT'S ELECTION CAMPAIGN GATHERS SPACE, WE'RE SEEING THE RISE OF CANDIDATES FROM ISLAMIC PARTIMENT ONE MORE RADICAL THAN THE NEXT.
Jon: SEE WE WANT DEMOCRACY TO FLOURISH OVER THERE AS LONG TAS IS THE  KIND WE GET TO CHOOSE, YOU KNOW, THE GOOD KIND. THE KIND WHERE THEY CHOOSE PEOPLE THAT LIKE US. WE WANT DEMOCRACY TO FLOWER. AND THE FRUIT OF IT NOT TO GIVE US DIARRHEA. AMONG THE MORE RADICAL CANDIDATES TO FOR OFFICE. HAZAMABUL, AN ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST SO EXTROM HE IS ACTUALLY TO THE RIGHT OF  9 MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, WHO ONCE SAID OF OSAMA BIN LADEN SAID QUOTE I HOPE GOD WILL  BELIEVE HIM AMONG BELIEVER, MAR TEST AND RIGHT OUST, ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR BIN LADEN DID ASK HIM FOR A LINKED IN TESTIMONIAL. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOT WRITE ONE. GOD, HE IS EXTREMIST, HE'S NOT AN [BLEEP]. THERE IS A SILVER LINING THOUGH, HE MAY WIND UP BEING DISQUALIFIED FROM THE  EGYPTIAN ELECTION FOR A KIND OF PECULIAR REASON.
PROTESTORS IN EGYPT ARE UNHAPPY THAT A LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER MAY BE DISQUALIFIED. EGYPT'S ELECTION COMMISSION HAS REVEALED THAT THE MOTHER OF LAWYER TURNED PREACHER  ISMALE SAN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
Jon: OH, HOW AWESOME IS THAT? THE GUY WHO IS A RADICAL WHO HATES AMERICA IS GETTING TRIPPED UP BY AN EGYPTIAN  BIRTHER CONTROVERSY. FIRST LET MOW SAY THIS, KODD OWES, EGYPT TOX HAVE THIS LITTLE OF CRAZY [BLEEP] AFFECTING YOUR VERY FIRST REAL ELECTION. ITS-- SOME DEMOCRACIES GROW UP SO FAST. AND SECOND, AND HERE IS THE ONE I REALLY LOVE ABOUT THIS, IN THIS BIRTHER CONTROVERSY, WE, AMERICA, ARE KENYA. THAT IS HOW TOXIC WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE CRAZY FOREIGN PLACE FULL OF DANGEROUS IDEAS THAT IS RENDERING A GUY UNFIT TO  HOLD OFFICE BECAUSE HIS MOTHER IS ALLEGEDLY FROM THAT PLACE, IS AMERICA. (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA, THAT IS WHERE HIS MOM IS FROM. I CAN SEE THE ATTACK ADS NOW.
HAZIM ISMALE SAYS HE OPPOSE THE AMERICAN IMPERIALIST INFIDEL WITH ALL HIS HEART. BUT HOW CAN HE WHEN HIS MOTHER IS ONE OF THEM. HE SAYS HE IS A MUSLIM BUT DID HE SECRETLY ATTEND A CATHOLIC SCHOOL? HOW DO WE KNOW? HE DOESN'T PAL AROUND WITH KNOWN TERRORISTS. CAN WE TRUST A MAN WITH TIES TO SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA? A PLACE SO RADICAL A MAN CAN SHARE AN APARTMENT THERE WITH NOT ONE BUT TWO UNMARRIED WOMEN. WHEN IT COMES TO THE MAN WHO RULES EGYPT WITH AN IRON FIST FOR ITS NEXT 60 YEAR, WE JUST CAN'T RISK IT. PAID FOR BY EGYPTIANS FOR TRUTH.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
