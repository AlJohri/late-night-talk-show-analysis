( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT FROM "NEWS WEEK" AND A BESTSELLING AUTHOR WHOSE  LATEST BOOK,"THE PROMISE:  PRESIDENT OBAMA YEAR ONE" IS NOW OUT IN PAIP BACK. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, JONATHAN ALTER. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON OUR HISTORIC STATE OF THE UNION COVERAGE. THE "THE PROMISE:  PRESIDENT OBAMA PART ONE." THIS WAS HIS SECOND STATE OF THE  UNION ADDRESS?
THAT'S CORRECT.
Jon:  IS HE BETTER NOW? IS HE A BETTER PRESIDENT THAN HE WAS?
I THINK HE IS. IT'S ACTUALLY THE FOURTH TIME HE'S APPEARED BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS. THIS IS HIS VENUE OF CHOICE. IT'S BETTER WHEN HE HAS AN AUDIENCE TO INTERACT WITH. HE'S NOT AS GOOD IN THE OVAL OFFICE ADDRESSES. HE TEND TO DO WELL IN THESE EVENTS. HE DID WELL WHEN HE ADDRESSED CONGRESS ABOUT HEALTH CARE IN THE FALL OF 2009. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE BIG SURPRISE ABOUT OBAMA IS WE EXPECTED HIM TO BE THIS GREAT  COMMUNICATOR, AND TO STRUGGLE IN EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP, STRUGGLE AT GETTING THINGS DONE BECAUSE  HE HAD NO EXPERIENCE, YOU KNOW. AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE REVERSE. HE STRUGGLED MOST THE TIME TO COMMUNICATE, TO CONNECT WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
Jon:  RIGHT.
AND, YET, HE'S ACCOMPLISHED MORE IN TERMSES-RECORD THAN ANY  PRESIDENT SINCE LYNDON JOHNSON.
Jon:  HOW DO YOU JUDGE THAT?
I DO A LOT OF THAT IN THE BOOK. A LOT OF IT IS SORT OF BEHIND-THE-SCENES STORIES OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY CLOSE THE  DOOR TO THE OVAL OFFICE BUT A LOT OF IT IS TO SAY HOW DOES HE STACK UP?
Jon:  IS THE METRIC JUST WHAT HE GETS DONE OR THE AMOUNT THAT HE GETS DONE? BECAUSE I IMAGINE THAT THERE IS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS AND A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. SO IMAGINE QUANTITATIVELY YOU CAN SAY HE'S GOTTEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT DONE BUT NOW CHILDREN  UNDER 5 ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LIVE AT HOME. MATCHING IT UP, IT SEEMS HARD TO ADJUST LYNDON JOHNSON'S CIVIL  RIGHTS ACT TO MAYBE DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL. I GUESS THAT WOULD BE THE ANALOGOUS LEGISLATION.
I'M NOT SAYING HE EXCEEDED JOHNSON. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOCIAL LEGISLATION, THE HEALTH CARE BILL IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF  SOCIAL LEGISLATION SINCE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID --
IT'S A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER THE HEALTH CARE.
WE'VE BEEN TOLD. BUT INSURING 30 MILLION AMERICANS AND ENDING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SICK PEOPLE. I THINK WE'LL LOOK BACK AND SAY, "CAN YOU BELIEVE WE USED TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE IF YOU GOT CANCER YOU HAD TO SELL YOUR  HOUSE." WE'RE NOT GOING TO LIVE IN THAT COUNTRY ANY MORE, AND THAT'S A GOOD THING  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  UNTIL, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S REPEALED ( LAUGHTER ) THEN YOU LIVE IN THAT COUNTRY FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER. I WAS SURPRISED WHEN HE WENT WITH -- THEY HAVE TO GO WITH A CERTAIN URGING US ON IN THE  STATE OF THE STIEWN-- WITH THE PHRASE, WE CAN WIN THE FUTURE."
YEAH, THEY WANT THAT TO BE THEIR BUZZWORD. THEY TITLE THE THE SPEECH --
WIN THE FUTURE. I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE TRYING TO DEFEAT THE FUTURE. BECAUSE THE FUTURE ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE, NO MATTER WHAT, IT WINS. THERE'S A CERTAIN INEVITABILITY TO THE FUTURE.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS PART OF THEIR EFFORT TO TURN THIS INTO A COMPETITION BECAUSE THEY KNOW  AMERICANS LIKE TO COMPETE. AND I DO THINK THERE WAS A CERTAIN TONE TO THE SPEECH, A STRUCT TOWER IT WHERE HE SAID, YOU KNOW, WE WILL OUT-INNOVATE, OUT-EDUCATE, AND OUT-BUILD THE REST OF THE WORLD. AND HE KNOWS THAT THIS SPUTNIK MOMENT DOES GET PEOPLE'S USES FLOWING A LITTLE BIT-- ALTHOUGH, AS YOU POINT OUT MAYBE NOT FOR AS BIG ENDS AS J.F.K. WAS LOOKING FOR. HE HAS BEEN KIND OF SOUNDBITE CHALLENGED. THERE'S NOT A LOT TO CHISEL AND MARBLE MUCH LESS TWEAK ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS HE SAYS AND I  THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT A LITTLE BIT, THAT HE NEEDS SOME SLOGANS GOING INTO THE NEXT CAMPAIGN.
Jon:  THERE ARE PEOPLE SITTING IN A ROOM IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WITH A BLACKBOARD, AND  THEY'RE JUST THROWING OUT LIKE, "WIN THE FUTURE." AND THEN SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE LIKE, "U.S.A.  FEAR FACTOR."  YOU KNOW, WE CAN EAT MORE BULL TESTICLES THAN CHINA. LIKE THAT KIND OF THING, SETTING IT UP AS THOUGH THE WAY TO PROD US, TO MOVE FORWARD, THEY FEEL  THAT IT HAS TO BE PITHY.
AND THEY'VE HAD A PITHY PROBLEM?
Jon:  HAVE THEY? AS YOU AGE, IT'S HARDER AND HARDER TO TELL.
THEY HAD A PROFESSORIAL PITHY PROBLEM WHICH THEY ADDRESSED A LITTLE BIT LAST NIGHT. IT WAS LESS PROFESSORIAL.
Jon:  DO YOU SENSE, THOUGH, THAT AMERICANS HAVE THAT-- THAT SENSE OF, LIKE, DON'T WE NEED TO BE GIVEN A GOAL? ONCE YOU SAY, "THIS IS OUR SPUTNIK MOMENT" ISN'T YOUR NEXT  STEP TO SAY, "SO HERE'S WHERE WE'RE GOING," RATHER THAN THE  LIST OF THINGS THAT HE LISTED THAT WERE OUR GOALS OF ACHIEVEMENT SOUNDED VERY SIMILAR  TO EVERY STATE OF THE UNION. I REMEMBER BUSH SAYING WE'RE GOING TO MARS. HE TALKED ABOUT NO ANIMAL-- HUMAN HUBRIDES OR SOME OTHER THINGS. OBAMA'S LIST STRUCK ME AS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 80% WIFI.
OH, WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE DRIVING A NISSAN LEAF OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Jon:  IT DIDN'T STRIKE ME AS A SPUTNIK MOMENT AS LET'S ALL  CHANGE OUR LIGHTBULBS.
WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GO TO THE MOON. THAT WAS THE INTERNAL INCONSISTENCY HERE. THEY LAID OUT AN INVESTMENT AGENDA-- THE REPUBLICANS CALL SPENDING AND THE DEMOCRATS CALL  IT INVESTMENT.
Jon:  IT STRIKES ME AS OBAMA BASICALLY IN THE WAY THAT THAT-- WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER AND  MAYBE OUR FAMILY DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY THAT YEAR, THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THE  BEST CHRISTMAS IS THE POOR CHRISTMAS. IT'S LIKE, "HEY! WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST CHRISTMAS EVER THIS YEAR! YOU KNOW WHY? WE'RE GOING TO MAKE EACH OTHER SOMETHING." IT'S THAT URGING ON OF, "WE CAN  DO THIS. IT'S OUR SPUTNIK MOMENT, BUT WE'RE GOING TO USE ALUMINUM FOIL  INSTEAD OF A SATELLITE."
OR WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF THE SALMON BUREAU WITH THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT.
Jon:  YOU'LL BE SURPRISED, ONCE THEY'RE GONE, THE WHOLE THING TURNS AROUND, BABY.
THEY COULD REORGANIZE. THAT COULD BE THE BIG THING COMING OUT OF THE SPEECH, JON. THEY DO HAVE A REAL, 21st CENTURY REORGANIZATION. A LOT OF TIMES THEY'RE JUST MOVING THE PIECES ON THE ORGANIZATION CHART, BUT IF HE  MAKES GOOD ON THAT, THE REPUBLICANS MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT, TOO, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO  TELL THEIR CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY WHACKED SOME AGENCIES SO THERE ARE SOME AREAS, PERHAPS  IMMIGRATION-- ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  THE REPUBLICANS JUST GO BACK TO THE DISTRICT LIKE, "I TOOK CARE OF THAT THING. "THE PROMISE:  PRESIDENT OBAMA YEAR ONE" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
I'VE GOT YEAR TWO IN THE PAPERBACK.
Jon:  THERE YOU GO JONATHAN
