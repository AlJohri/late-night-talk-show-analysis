(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK. NEW YORK CITY. THE GREATEST CITY ON EARTH. AND SAMANTHA B FOUND OUT POLITICIANS JUST FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT EVEN GREATER.
NEW YORK CITY PARKS. AN OASIS SULLIED BY A SCOURGE OF SELF-ISH MISS KRINTS. PEOPLE SMOKING BUT FINALLY THERE'S JUSTICE.
NEW YORK CITY HAS EXPANDED SMOKING BAN HAS TAKEN EFFECT NOT LIGHTING UP  AT PARKS, BEACHES OR PEDESTRIANS PLAZAS.
POLITICIANS HAVE STOOD UP AND SAID NOT IN OUR BACKYARD.
PARKS ARE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD GO TO RELAX AND TO HAVE FUN. GO WITH THEIR KIDS AND NOT, YOU KNOW, FEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO EXPOSE THEM TO CIGARETTE SMOKE.
WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THE PARK THEY WANT IT TO BE CLEAN AND GREEN. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE FRESH AIR, NOT HAVE A BUNCH OF LITTER, A BUNCH OF  CIGARETTE BUTTS WHERE THEY ARE SITTING DOWN TO HAVE A PICNIC.
AND THE PARKS AREN'T JUST FOR PICNICS.
EVERY ONE CAN FINALLY ENJOY THE SPLEN DOOR OF OUR OUTDOOR SPACES.
TELL ME ABOUT WHAT THE PARKS WERE LIKE PRIOR TO THE SMOKING BAN.
IT WAS NOT AS ENJOYABLE. IT WAS NOT AS ENJOYABLE.
NOT AS FAMILY [BLEEP] [BLEEP]-- [BLEEP] OH, LOOKS LIKE THOSE TWO ARE HAVING A MINOR DISAGREEMENT OVER THE  USE OF GREEN SPACE. OKAY. DON'T GET STABBED. LET'S HAVE A PICNIC. I'LL GET MY PICNIC BASKET AND GO ON THE GRASS OVER HERE AND HAVE FUN.
I DON'T THINK-- I DON'T THINK WE CAN GO ON THE GRASS. IT'S NOT LEGAL.
I'M SORRY, SAY THAT AGAIN.
I THINK THE GRASS IS OFF LIMITS.
OH! OH MY GOD, THAT'S AWESOME. SO THIS PARK IS JUST FOR SHOW. SO YAY! YOU DID IT! CONGRAT LATIONS! BEAUTIFICATION OF THE PARK, ACCOMPLISHED.
YES, ACCOMPLISHED, YES.
THESE GENTLEMEN ARE JUST MAKING SURE THAT NOTHING WEIRD HAPPENS.
SURE.
JUST KIND OF PATROLLING THE PARK.
OKAY.
OH.
I'M SORRY, NO, I DON'T. SORRY.
DO YOU HAVE CIGARETTE ROLLING PAPERS.
NOBODY, I DON'T.
NO, WE DON'T.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE INHIBITS MY ENJOYMENT OF THE PARK.
WHAT?
THIS GIANT UNDULATING PILE OF HUMAN SORROW. I HAVE TO GO HOME AT THE END OF BEING IN THIS PARK AND SCRUB MYSELF WITH A METAL  BARBECUE BRUSH JUST TO GET ALL THE SADNESS OFF. ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING ME, SMOKING! NO MATTER HOW JUST THE LAW, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME REPROBATES WHO INSIST ON BREAKING IT.
HOW ARE THOSE DRUG ADDICTS SUPPOSED TO TWEAK PROPERLY WITH ALL OF YOUR  SECONDHAND SMOKE BLOWING IN THEIR FACES.
I TRY NOT TO GET NEAR THEM WHEN I'M SMOKING.
THAT'S KIND OF YOU. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO CALL THAT HOBO MAN OVER THERE WHO IS WASHING HIS BUM IN THE WATER FOUNTAIN? OKAY, OH, OH --
THERE ARE JUST SOME THINGS THAT NOBODY SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO IN A PUBLIC PARK.
I CAN'T SMOKE IN THIS PARK.
NO, YOU CAN'T.
. SAM B, WE'LL
