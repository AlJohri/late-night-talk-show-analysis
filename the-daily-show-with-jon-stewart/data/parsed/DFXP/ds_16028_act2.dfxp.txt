(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. BEFORE AN... AN ADMINISTRATION'S WORK IS NEVER DONE. WHILE THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND DEFENSE MAY BE FOCUSED ON THE MIDDLE EAST, LABOR AND  COMMERCE ON THE TROUBLED HEARTLAND, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WANTS YOU TO KNOW IT HAS  THE PULSE OF GAYSYLVANIA.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION REVERSED COURSE TODAY WHEN IT ANNOUNCED IT WILL NO LONGER  DEFEND IN COURT A FEDERAL LAW THAT DEFINES MARRIAGE AS BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN.
Jon: OH, MY GOD, MARRIAGE IS NO LONGER BEING DEFENDED. DID YOU HEAR THAT, GAYS? ATTACK! ATTACK! ATTACK! TORAH TORAH TORAH! THIS IS A MOMENTOUS DECISION WITH UNTOLD LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES. (LAUGHTER) LUCKILY, MSNBC WAS IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL.
THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO OBSERVE IT, IT'S NOT GOING TO  JUST SUDDENLY STOP OBSERVING IT. BUT IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL.
OKAY. THANKS A LOT. APPRECIATE THE LIEDUP THERE, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP TABS ON IT. I WANT TO GO TO BREAKING NEWS IN LOS ANGELES NOW. WE'VE BEEN WATCHING THAT COURTROOM WHERE COURT IS NOW IN PROGRESS AND WE'VE LISTENED TO  THE JUDGE JUST TELL LINDSAY LOHAN THERE WILL BE JAIL TIME IN THIS CASE. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: HOW IS LINDSAY LOHAN IN COURT BREAKING NEWS? (LAUGHTER) BREAKING NEWS IS "OH, MY GOD, SHE'S IN A MOVIE!" (LAUGHTER) WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS HISTORIC  CIVIL RIGHTS DEVELOPMENT FOR GAY AMERICANS PROVIDED THAT TARA REID STAYS OUT OF TROUBLE. (LAUGHTER) WHAT MAKES THIS TURNAROUND ESPECIALLY SURPRISING IS THAT  THE PRESIDENT'S STAND AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE HAS LONG FRUSTRATED GAY OBAMA FOLLOWERS. BY WHICH I MEAN GAY DEMOCRATS, NOT FOLLOWERS OF GAY OBAMA, MY PARODY TWITTER FEED OF WHICH THERE ARE ZERO FOLLOWERS, ALTHOUGH I'M GUESSING AFTER TONIGHT I WILL HAVE MORE THAN ZERO FOLLOWERS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S MY SITE. LET'S SEE HOW JAY CARNEY DEATHLY PARRY IT IS ISSUE.
CAN YOU TELL US WHERE HIS POSITION ON GAY MARRIAGE STANDS AT THIS POINT?
I WOULD REFER YOU JUST TO HIS FAIRLY RECENT STATEMENTS ON THAT. HE'S GRABLING WITH THE ISSUE.
REALLY. GRAPPLING? THAT'S... FIRST WEEK ON THE JOB WITH THE GAY MARRIAGE QUESTION  AND YOU SAY HE'S GRAPPLING? (LAUGHTER) YES, THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO GET A FIRM GRASP ON A SLIPPERY, SUNNIY ISSUE. WE COULD EASILY PUT BALLS IN HIS MOUTH. WAIT! NO! I'LL GET BETTER AT THIS! BY THE WAY, MR. CARNEY, WELCOME TO THE SHOW. (LAUGHTER) IF I WERE YOU, I'D BE TAKING PICTURES OF YOU WHAT YOU LOOK  LIKE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE TWO YEARS FROM NOW (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. NOW, ONCE THE LIBERALS START TO MESS WITH MARRIAGE....
Jon:
JOHN BOEHNER'S PRESS SECRETARY REPLIED: WHILE AMERICANS WANT WASHINGTON TO  FOCUS ON CREATING JOBS AND CUTTING SPENDING, THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY HE  THINKS NOW IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO STIR UP A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE THAT SHARPLY DIVIDES THE NATION.
Jon: HERE YE, HERE YE. CONGRESS SHOULD GET BACK TO TALKING ABOUT ISSUES THAT DON'T DIVIDE THE NATION. LIKE... HMM... (LAUGHTER) PLEASE SEND YOUR SUGGESTIONS TO TWITTER AT "THE DAILY SHOW" OR  AT GAY OBAMA SINCE WE JUST... (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
