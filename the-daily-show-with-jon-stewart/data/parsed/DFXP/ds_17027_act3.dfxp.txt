Jon: VERY NICE. THANK YOU. THAT'S LOVELY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE COMES BEARING GIFTS. THANK YOU.
SAVE LIVES.
Jon: WHAT IS NICE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WHEN YOU FIRST CAME OUT WITH THIS I THOUGHT YOU WERE  BASICALLY THINKING THIS WAS GOING TO BE SO (bleep) BORING I'LL JUST LISTEN TO MUSIC WHILE  JON IS TALKING TO AMERICA I THOUGHT YOU WERE BRINGING OUT HEADPHONES FOR YOURSELF.
I SAW YOU ROCKING IN YOUR CHAIR THERE.
Joe: THAT'S WHAT JEWS DO.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT JEWS DO. WE --  [ LAUGHTER ] HOW HAVE BEEN BEEN, MAN?
BEEN GOOD.
Jon: YOU HAD SOMETHING ON YOUR BACK. ARE YOU HEALED AND HEALTHY?
I'LL VERY WELL. REBUILT BY GERMAN ENGINEERING. YES.
Jon: IN GERMANY, THE HOSPITALS THERE, WE'VE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE HEALTH CARE  IN THE UNITED STATES IS SECOND TO NONE. SO WHAT I'M ASSUMING YOU HAD NO CHANCE TO DO IT IN THE UNITED STATES. [ LAUGHTER ]
THERE'S A -- IN GERMANY IN MUNICH THERE'S A VERY COOL OPERATION THERE RUN BY A  GENTLEMAN RUN BY A GENTLEMAN NAMED MOLWILFA.
Jon: SOUNDS SIN STEMPLE.
I WAS TOLD HE WAS THE BEST AND I WENT TO MEET WITH HIM AND. NOT I'M NOT IN TROUBLE.
Jon: DID HE SAIRK WE'LL FIX YOU. WE WILL DO WHAT WE CAN.
IT WAS QUITE CLOSE. I WAS TOLD, YOU SAID, YOU NO, FOR THIS PROCEDURE, HE SAID LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE AT SOME RISKS. I SAID LIKE WHAT? HE SAID, THE DROPPED FOOT. I AND I WENT, THE DROP FOOT. YOU MIGHT WALK WITH A LIMP AND ALSO THE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION. AND MY WIFE WAS THERE AND SHE SAID GREAT! [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M VERY PLEASED AT THIS GREAT GERMAN CARE. I HAVE NEITHER OF THOSE PROBLEMS.
Jon: CONAT-BAT LAITIONS. VERY EXCITE -- CONGRATULATIONS. VERY EXCITING. THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY WHATEVER DOCTOR I GO TO, I WOULD HOPE THAT HE WOULD MENTION THE  SEXUAL THING FIRST. I WOULD HOPE HE WOULD SAY SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION AND DROP FOOT.
I SAID IS THERE ANY WAY AROUND THE PROCEDURE? HE SAID NO. AND I SAID WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THEN? AND HE FOR INSURANCE REASONS.
Jon: WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT AFTER ALL P. I'M READING IN THE  MATERIAL, YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS WANT TO BY 2015 GIVE EVERYONE AIDS AND I JUST THINK THAT -- I  THINK IT'S A MISCALCULATION ON YOUR PART AND I THINK PROMOTIONALLY IT'S NOT A SMART  MOVE FOR A PERFORMER.
BUT YOU HAVE TO STAND FOR SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HOW DO YOU EVEN GET INVOLVED IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND HOW DO YOU HAVE TWO  ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY ARE OUT. ONE IS MORE OF A FUND-RAISING ARM, YES?
YES. RED.
Jon: THAT'S RED.
RED IS THE SORT OF GATEWAY DRUG TO ACTIVISM WHICH IS THE ONE CAMPAIGN. THERE'S THREE MILLION ONE CAMPAIGNERS AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT HARASS POLITICIANS OF  ALL COLORS INTO DOING THE RIGHT THING. BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE, YOU KNOW IT'S TOO COMPLICATED THEY SAID HOW DO I HELP? I HEAR THERE'S PEOPLE DYING. WE HEAR TWO PILLS A DAY WILL STOP THEM FROM DYING. HOW DO I HELP? BUY RED PRODUCTS THIS CHRISTMAS. IT'S GREAT.
Jon: WHAT IS YOUR ANGLE ON THIS? WHAT IS YOUR CUT? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH?
I SHOULD WORK ON THIS IT'S NEARLY $200 MILLION ON RED AND  ON THE ONE CAMPAIGN I WILL SAY A ALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WE'RE AT A  BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT WHICH IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. TOMORROW IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED FOR WORLD AIDS DAY THE POTENTIAL FOR THE END OF THE SCOURGE OF  AIDS SO THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF AIDS. WHICH IS -- EVEN AS IT COMES OUT OF MY MOUTH -- KIND OF AMAZING.
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING TOMORROW IS THE ANNOUNCEMENT?
NO, WE'RE SAYING WE'RE HOPING VERY MUCH PRESIDENT OBAMA IS  GOING TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON WHAT PRESIDENT BUSH DID.
Jon: LET ME SWIRL THAT AROUND IN MY MOUTH.
I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR TO YOU ACCEPT. IT'S AMAZING. PEOPLE LIKE JOHN KERRY WORKED FOR THIS AND HILLARY CLINTON AND EVENTUALLY PRESIDENT CLINTON DID  EXTRAORDINARY STUFF RENEGOTIATING THE PRICES OF THESE VERY EXPENSIVE DRUGS DOWN. GEORGE BUSH KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT AMERICA HAS NOW FIVE MILLION PEOPLE BEING KEPT ALIVE BY THESE DRUGS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW. IT'S AN AMAZING THING.
Jon: I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT THIS TOMORROW. THAT SOUNDS REMARKABLE. PEOPLES 'HOPES HAVE BEEN RAISED BEFORE THE END OF THIS DISEASE BUT I REALLY HOPE --
IT'S A MASS THING. IT'S AT THE MOMENT -- FOR EVERY PERSON YOU TREAT TWO MORE ARE INFECTED. THE MOMENT WHEN YOU HAVE INFECTIONS IS THE MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN TURN THAT AROUND AND THE  SCIENCE IS NOW WITH US. IF YOU GET THESE PEOPLE THE DRUGS EARLY. IF YOU GET WOMEN IN PARTICULAR DRUGS EARLY WHO ARE PREGNANT, YOU CAN -- AND MALE CIRCUMSIGNIFICANCE IS AN IMPORTANT BIT. THE BEGINNING OF END OF THE AIDS. IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO STAY WITH THIS EVEN IN HARSH ECONOMIC TIMES THAT IS YOURS. YOU'LL HAVE TURNED THIS AROUND.
Jon: I STOPPED PAYING ATTENTION WHEN YOU SAID IT'S A MATH THING.
A, B, CD --
Jon: VERY NICE JOB.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR
