Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A WRITER, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED  "THE PIRATES OF SOMALIA: INSIDE THE HIDDEN WORLD." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  JAY BAHADUR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS FOR JOINING US. COME AND SIT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE PIRATES OF SOMALIA. THE HIDDEN WORLD." JAY, YOU ARE HOW OLD?
I'M 27 NOW.
Jon: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU WENT BY YOURSELF TO SOMALIA TO LIVE AMONGST THE PIRATES?
WELL, WHEN I STARTED SCHEMING ABOUT IT I WAS 24.
Jon: AS YOUR FATHER, I CANNOT ALLOW THIS! (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, SURPRISINGLY MY PARENTS SAID VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT. WHICH IS... CAUSED ME TO BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT IT SINCE THEN BECAUSE... (LAUGHTER). EVERY MEDIA INTERVIEW I DO PEOPLE ASK "WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS THINK?"  AND I THINK "NEVER SAID ANYTHING." THEN AGAIN I NEVER HAD A TALK  ABOUT DRUGS, SEX, ALCOHOL, SO... NEITHER DID I HAVE ONE ABOUT GOING TO EMBED WITH VICIOUS MEN ON MY OWN.
Jon: SO YOUR PARENTS ARE SOMEWHAT LAISSEZ-FAIRE WHEN IT COMES TO PARENTING?
YEAH, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT, YES.
Jon: FAIR ENOUGH. IT IS A REMARKABLE STORY. THERE'S A GREAT SEQUENCE THAT DICTATES YOUR, I GUESS, 45-HOUR  TRIP, AS A 24-YEAR-OLD YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND YOU  LAND, UKRAINIAN PILOT WITH COLD WAR TECHNOLOGY LANDS YOU SOMALIA AND YOU STEP OUT OF THE PLANE  AND THINK...
WELL, I SAID TO MYSELF "I'M IN (BLEEP) SOMALIA." (LAUGHTER)  THIS WAS SOMETHING... AND I TALK ABOUT IN THE THE BOOK HOW IT'S A  STRANGE EXPERIENCE GOING FROM A PLACE WHERE I'VE ALWAYS CONSUMED NEWS MY WHOLE LIFE TO A PLACE  THAT'S REALLY ONLY BEEN DEFINED BY THE NEWS. I NEVER KNEW ANYONE WHO'D BEEN TO SOMALIA. I WOULD GUESS THE SAME IS TRUE OF YOU.
Jon: NO, I'VE GOT SOME... (LAUGHTER). SOME PEOPLE ON MY CHRISTMAS CARD LIST.
SO IT'S A COUNTRY THAT'S TOTALLY BEEN MANUFACTURED OUT OF  NEWS REPORTS AND COMING TO TERMS WITH THAT WAS SORT OF AN EXPERIENCE.
Jon: IS THE PORTRAYAL OF SOMALIA, THEN, MORE CHAOTIC, LESS CHAOTIC, IS IT IN ANY WAY AN ACCURATE PORTRAYAL? IS IT SUPERFICIAL AND EXAGGERATED? WHAT'S...
WELL, I THINK IT HAS TO BE SUPERFICIAL BECAUSE ONE THING THAT DOESN'T COME ACROSS IN  MEDIA REPORTS IS THE FACT THAT SOMALIA IS INCREDIBLY SEGREGATE BID CLAN AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE ON  THE GROUND IS IN THE SOUTH IT'S A MESS. IT'S SORT OF LIKE WHAT YOU SEE IN THE NEWS. IN THE NORTH THERE'S A LOT OF MINI STATES THAT HAVE CROPPED UP WHERE LOCAL PEOPLE HAVE COME  TOGETHER AND, YOU KNOW, FORMED GOVERNMENTS. BECAUSE PEOPLE GENERALLY DON'T LIKE TO LIVE IN ANARCHY. AND SO YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF THESE STATELETS AND ONE OF THESE REGIONS I ENDED UP GOING TO WAS  THE CENTER OF THE WHOLE PIRACY EXPLOSION 2008 AND IT WAS CALLED PUNTLAND. THE BOOK WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED "THE PIRATES OF PUNTLAND" BUT  NOBODY KNOWS WHAT PUNTLAND IS SO... (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YOU MENTION THE TERM IN THE BOOK THAT THEY PREFERRED TO BE REFERRED AS...
SAVIORS OF THE SEA. WHICH IS A ROUGH TRANSLATION BUT, YEAH, IT'S... IT ENCAPSULATES HOW THEY SEE THEMSELVES.
Jon: WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE IS IT'S THE FIRST GENERATION OF  THE PIRATES COMES FROM DEFENDING THEIR LOBSTER FISHING TURF. THAT SOME OF THESE PIRATES WERE ACTUALLY LOBSTER FISHERMEN.
RIGHT. AND THAT'S TRUE FOR A VERY, VERY, VERY SMALL NUMBER. WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS THAT FISHING WAS NEVER A HUGE PART OF THE SOMALI ECONOMY. IN FACT, THE FORMER DICTATOR, THE ONLY REASON THERE WERE FISHING COMMUNITIES IS BECAUSE HE WAS A MARXIST AND WANTED TO  REENGINEER SOCIETY. SO HE ESSENTIALLY STARTED FORCIBLY RELOCATING PEOPLE INTO THESE FISHING COMMUNITIES IN THE  '70s AND '80s WHICH WAS HOW SOME OF THE PIRATES STARTED. BUT NOW IT'S SORT OF GONE... IT'S FLOATED WAY BEYOND THAT. IT'S BECOME PART OF THE PIRATE P.R. MACHINE. AND THERE VERY MUCH IS A PIRATE P.R. MACHINE. I SWEAR. WHEN YOU SPEAK TO THEM IT'S LIKE THEY'RE BEING ISSUED PRESS RELEASES.
Jon: YOU SAID ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO INTERVIEW THEM WAS TO GET THEM CHEW ON... HOW DO  YOU... KA'AT, THE LEAF THAT MAKES THEM DROWSY...
Jon: QUITE THE OPPOSITE. IT'S LIKE A COCA LEAF, SOMETHING THAT REALLY JACKS YOU UP. (LAUGHTER) AND THE... I THOUGHT IT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING IN THE WORLD BECAUSE YOU THINK, YOU KNOW, PIRATES ARE... YOU READ IN THE MEDIA THAT THEY'RE BUILDING HUGE  HOUSES AND LIVE THESE LUXURIOUS LIFE-STYLES BUT THEY SPEND IT ALL ON THIS DRUG. IT'S... (LAUGHTER). IT'S A REALLY FOUL-TASTING LEAF IMPORTED FROM KENYA AND ETHIOPIA. THEY CAN'T GROW IT THERE SO THEY'RE SENDING THE MONEY BACK INTO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETSES. AND I REALIZED VERY CONVICTLY THAT THIS WAS THE WAY TO A PIRATES' HEART. YOU BRING HIM BAGS OF KA'AT, YOU NEED TO BRING BAGS OF THEM, CHEW  IT FOR HOURS IN A PICNIC-LIKE SETTING... (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I JUST HATE IT WHEN ANTS (BLEEP) THE WHOLE THING UP. GO AHEAD.
I WAS TOLD WHEN I WAS TRYING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT IT WOULD EITHER MAKE ME SEX CRAZED  OR RELAXED AND TALKATIVE. I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE WAS SUCH A DICHOTOMY BETWEEN THE TWO EFFECTS. (LAUGHTER) BUT IT MADE ME RELAXED AND TALKATIVE. (LAUGHTER) A LOT OF THE PIRATES IT ACTUALLY REALLY MAKES THEM QUITE SEX CRAZED.
Jon: YOU WOULD THINK THAT SOMALI PIRATES WOULD BE MORE RESPONSIBLE. (LAUGHTER) AND YET IT'S REALLY... IT'S A GREAT READ AND THE FACT OF  MEETING YOU AND SEEING HOW YOUNG YOU ARE AND ALL THAT DEPRESSES THE HELL OUT OF ME. (LAUGHTER) BUT IT'S REALLY A GREAT PIECE OF WORK AND THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THE SHOW. "THE PIRATES OF SOMALIA" IS ON
