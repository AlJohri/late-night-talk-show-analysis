JANUARY 24, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SH   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FINE SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE GREAT STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS SENATE CANDIDATE ELIZABETH WARREN IS  GOING TO BE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. AND SHE AND I WILL ARM WRESTLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I BEAT HER, I GET TO JOIN A LEAGUE. [ LAUGHTER ] AS YOU KNOW, TONIGHT IS THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. WE'LL HAVE MORE COVERAGE OF AMERICA'S YEARLY EMPTY GESTURE TOMORROW. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR TONIGHT EXCITING NEWS. MITT ROMNEY'S 560 PAGE 2010 TAX RETURN HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC. IT'S AN EXCITING TOPIC THAT IN NO WAY NEEDS ZAZZING UP. LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT IN TONIGHT'S SEGMENT --  [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AS YOU KNOW, WHEN IT COMES TO HIP AND WHEN -- IF AND WHEN MITT ROMNEY WOULD RELEASE HIS TAX  RETURNS HE HAS BEEN NOTHING IF NOT CONSISTENT.
YOU WON'T RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS?
I DON'T INTEND TO RELEASE TAX RETURNS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: MITT?
TIME WILL TELL. IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M PLANNING TODAY BUT NEVER SAY NEVER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: MITT ROMNEY?
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN HISTORY IS PEOPLE RELEASE THEM IN APRIL OF COMING YEAR. THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.
Jon: MITTHALAMEU THE THIRD YOUR TAX RETURNS, SIR!
I'LL DO THAT ON TUESDAY OF THIS WEEK.
Jon: THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M NEVER GOING TO DO IT. I'LL DO IT IN APRIL. HERE THEY ARE. UNTIL LAST NIGHT ROMNEY RELEASED THE QUICKEN.
THE REMEMBER CANDIDATE PAID ABOUT $6 MILLION IN TAXES OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.
Jon: $6 MILLION OVER TWO YEARS THAT'S LIKE ONE BIONIC MAN. THAT'S LIKE WHO!
HE MADE A COMBINED INCOME IN THOSE TWO YEARS OF NEARLY $43 MILLION.
Jon: SO $6 MILLION IS ONLY -- CARRY THE --
HIS OVERALL EFFECTIVE RATE WAS 13.9%.
Jon: NO, THAT'S WHAT I GOT. AT FIRST I HADN'T CARRIED THE MATH. [ LAUGHTER ] 13.9%. THAT'S A TAX RIGHT FOR SOMEONE WHO MAKES $15,000 A YEAR NOT SOMEONE WHO MAKES --
THE COMBINED INCOME COMES OUT TO $56,986 A DAY. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: THAT'SES ALMOST $-- THAT'S ALMOST $57,000 A DAY. HERE IS THE MOST AMAZING PART:  THE GUY DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A JOB. THAT IS INTEREST. THAT IS THE KIND OF MONEY THAT MIGHT LEAD A MAN TO MAKE STUPIDLY EXTRAVAGANT OUT OF  TOUCH IMPULSE BETS.
$10,000 BUCKS? $10,000 BET?
Jon: SO HIM. HE THROWS THAT -- I'LL BET YOU WHATEVER I MAKE IN THE TIME IT TAKES ME TO FINISH THIS SENTENCE. $10,000. $12,000, TAKE THE BET BEFORE I KEEP TALKING. HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU MITT ROMNEY JUSTIFY MAKING MORE IN ONE DAY THAN THE MEDIAN AMERICAN  FAMILY MAKES IN A YEAR WHILE PAYING AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF THE GUY WHO SCANS YOUR SHOES AT  THE AIRPORT.
I PAY ALL THE TAXES LEGALLY REQUIRED AND NOT A DOLLAR MORE. I DON'T WANT SOMEONE AS THE CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WITH WHO PAYS MORE TAXES THAN HE OWES.
Jon: NO, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT ONE WHO THINKS THAT IS WRONG. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE LITTLE GAME ROMNEY GETS TO PLAY. HERE IS THE GAME. HERE IS THE GAME. THIS IS THE GAME THAT MITT ROMNEY PLAYS. HIS TAX BURDEN IS ABSURDLY LOW. BUT HE IS JUST FOLLOWING THE PROVISIONS IN THE TAX CODE. THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO ABOUT IT. HE'S JUST A LAW ABIDING CITIZEN. HERE IS WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE RULES. IN 2007 THERE WAS A BIPARTISAN BILL TO MAKE PRIVATE EQUITY VETTORS LIKE ROMNEY PAY THE  ORDINARY INCOME TAX RATE OF 35% ON THE CARRIED INTEREST EARNINGS INSTEAD OF 15% THEY'VE BEEN  PAYING SINCE 1957. FUNNY STORY.
DO YOU SUSPECT THAT THE TAX TREATMENT FOR CARRIED INTEREST WILL BE CHANGED?
IF I TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF LOBBYISTS HIRED IN THE LAST TWO  MONTHS TO WORK THIS ISSUE, WOULD YOU KNOW THAT IT WOULD BE VERY RISKY FOR ME TO PREDICT WHAT  WOULD HAPPEN ON THIS.
Jon: MAY I MAKE A PREDICTION BECAUSE I'M IN THE FUTURE? [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, THEY KILLED IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BY THE WAY, WHO WERE THOSE LOBBISTS WHO HAD SO MUCH INFLUENCE THAT CHARLIE GRASSLEY, THE RANKING GUY, EXONED THE BILL TO ADJUST THE TAX RATE? WHO ARE THE LOBBYISTS TO POWERFUL THAT THIS GUY (bleep)S HIS BRICKS LIKE HE'S  TALKING ABOUT VOLDEMORT WHEN HE BRINGS THEM UP. IT WAS A LOBBYING GROUP PAID FOR BY COMPANIES INCLUDING BAIN CAPITAL. ROMNEY IS NOT BAIN AND BAIN IS NOT ROMNEY.
HAVE YOU COME OUT ON THE PROPOSALS COMING OUT THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS TO RAISE  TAXES ON HEDGE FUNDS PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS AND SO FORTH?
I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO RAISE TAXES.
Jon: YEAH, CAUSE THEY ARE YOUR TAXES! NOT TO SAY MITT ROMNEY DOESN'T --  [  APPLAUSE  ] NOT TO SAY MITT ROMNEY DOESN'T BELIEVE THE TAX SYSTEM NEED NOT BE REFORMED. THERE ARE CERTAIN TAXES HE FEELS SHOULD BE RAISED.
47% OF THE AMERICANS PAYING NO INCOME TAX. THAT'S A HECK OF A BIG NUMBER.
Jon: YEAH THE TAX CODE IS SO UNFAIR TO YOU. TO CLARIFY THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT MITT ROMNEY SAVES BECAUSE OF THE AGGRESSIVELY  LOBBIED 15% TAX RATE IS LEGAL AND FAIR. HE'S ENTITLED TO THAT FROM THE GOVERNMENT NO STRINGS ATTACHED. WHERE DID ROMNEY STAND ON OTHER SUCH GOVERNMENT LARGESSE?
I LIKE THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE RECEIVING WELFARE ASSISTANCE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF WORKING. I THINK HE WANTS US TO BE A SOCIETY WHERE THE PEOPLE FEEL THEY ARE ENTITLED FROM GOVERNMENT.
Jon: POOR PEOPLE HAVE (bleep) LOBBYISTS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW DOES ONE GAIN ENTRANCE -- HOW DOES ONE GAIN ENTRANCE TO THE BLIND OUT WORD OF MITT  ROMNEY -- BLINGED OUT WORLD OF MITT ROMNEY? IT'S NOT A BORING STORY. JASON JONES HAS THE ANSWER.
YO, MY BOY MITT PAYS ONLY 15%. WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW HE GETS THIS DONE. 15% YO THAT'S LOW! ♪ ♪ YO, I CAN SMELL THE BOOKS BEING COOKED IN HERE. HI JASON JONES TO SEE JOHN LIEBERMAN.
MR. LIEBERMAN WILL SEE YOU NOW. ♪ ♪ NO DOUBT I'M GONNA SHOW YOU WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS ♪
HIGH NETWORK INDIVIDUALS ARE DIFFERENT THAN REGULAR PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE ABLE TO TAKE  ADVANTAGES OF TAX CODE SETTING UP THE PARTNERSHIPS IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS ALL YOU HAVE TO  DO IS MAKE CURSORY INFORMATION.
LIKE (bleep) SUCKING (bleep) INFORMATION? WORD! TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS STUFF YOU ARE TELLING ME ABOUT.
WHEN YOU HAVE MONEY YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THINGS THANK JUST MAKES MY BRAIN HURT.
WE ADVISE PEOPLE TO TAKE THEIR ASSETS AND PUT THEM INTO TAX FREE BONDS. DEPENDING ON WHAT STATE THEY LIVE YOU CAN STRESS WHETHER THEY PAY ZERO OR HARDLY ANY TAXES  ATHE OUGHT.
OMG CAT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
THIS IS ALL COMPLETELY LEGAL?
YEAH IT'S LEGAL.
BREAK IT DOWN H AND R BLOCK?
THEY ARE REALLY AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY HIGH NET WORTH.
THAT WAS BORING. CAN A GET A REMIX.
1008O656, 1041 THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE REALLY HIGH, HIGH, HIGH NET WORTH.
I LIKE YOUR BEARD. THAT CALLED A CHIN STRAP SON.
WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS ENTER INTROSCHEDULE D.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO ENTER! SCHEDULE D!
REALLY THAT'S ALL YOU DO?
THAT'S IT.
YO, THAT WAS A LOT OF GOOD ADVICE BUT YOU BET YOU $10,000 YOU TOO POOR TO USE ANY OF IT. SEE YA! [  APPLAUSE  ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: JASON
