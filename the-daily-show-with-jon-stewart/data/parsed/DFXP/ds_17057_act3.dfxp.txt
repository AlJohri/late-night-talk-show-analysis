(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A RISK COMEDIAN. HE HAS A NEW SHOW FOR HBO CALLED "LIFE'S TOO SHORT."
I BELIEVE I SAID SOMETHING TO OFFEND YOU.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN LIKE TRASHING ME IN FRONT OF, LIKE 2,00 MILLION PEOPLE AT THE  GOLDEN GLOBES.
THAT WAS A WHILE AGO. THEY WERE JOKES, JOHNNY.
OH, THEY WERE JOKES, YEAH. YOU LIKE JOKES? GOOD. BECAUSE I ACTUALLY GOT TOGETHER WITH A FEW PALS AFTER THE AWARDS AND WE WROTE SOME JOKES ABOUT YOU. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS AND I WANT YOU TO CARRY THIS WITH YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR DAYS. NO ONE MAKES FUN OF TIM ALLEN ON MY WATCH. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM RICKEY GERVAIS. GEAR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MY LIEGE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE'S NOT A PIECE OF MEAT. HE'S A MAN WITH A MIND. HE'S A PIECE OF MEAT. FOR SECOND I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING STIMULATING ABOUT IT.
YOU CALMED THEM DOWN.
Jon: HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY. THANK YOU FOR SPENDING IT WITH ME.
MY PLEASURE. MY GIRLFRIEND SAID "WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO VALENTINE'S NIGHT?"  I SAID "SPEND IT WITH JON STEWART." SHE SAID "WHAT'S IN IT FOR HE? " I SAID, YOU CAN WATCH IT TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER) "BE PART OF IT," I SAID. "FEEL INVOLVED."
Jon: OBVIOUSLY YOU MEAN THE INTERVIEW.
THERE WILL BE NO HANKY-PANKY.
Jon: I DON'T HANK OR PANK.
JUST CUDDLE BUDDIES, JUST FRIEND.
Jon: THAT'S ALL IT IS.
LIKE PANDAS. THE THING IS RIGHT, NOW PANDAS ARE ONE OF THE MOST ENDANGERED SPECIES ON THE PLANET, RIGHT? WE'RE ALL RUSHING AROUND GOING LET'S SAVE THE PANDA BUT THEY'RE  NOT MEETING US HALFWAY. THEY'RE NOT HAVING SEX SO THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO SURVIVING. WHEN DID THEY STOP HAVING SEX? WHY ARE THEY SO LIKE MIDDLE CLASS BOHEMIAN GOING "WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE CHILDREN."  IT'S RIDICULOUS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS IS TRUE, DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE CHINESE. (LAUGHTER) THEY'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT THE PANDA THE NATIONAL EMBLEM THAT  THEY STARTED GIVING THEIR PANDAS IN CAPTIVITY VIAGRA. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. AND I LOOKED INTO THIS, RIGHT? THE NORMAL COPULATION OF A PANDA IS TWO MINUTES. WHICH IS FINE, I THINK. (LAUGHTER) ABOUT RIGHT, ISN'T IT?
Jon: NOT BAD. THAT DOESN'T SOUND ENDANGERED TO ME.
(LAUGHS) YES! GET IT DONE, RIGHT? NOW, BUT ON VIAGRA THEY CAN COP LATE FOR 30 MINUTES.
Jon: OH, FORGOD'S SAKE. GYP BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE? YOU FINISH OR YOU DON'T. SO WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? UNLESS VIAGRA MAKES YOU EJACULATE FOR THE FULL 30 MINUTES TO MAKE... (LAUGHTER). UNTIL THEY JUST SORT OF SLIP OFF THE BACK OF THE FEMALE LIKE SOMETHING YOU STICK YOUR PAJAMAS  IN AND... (LAUGHTER). THE FEMALE IS LEFT LIKE A BIG WOBBLY SPUNK BOMB. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S TRUE. THAT IS TRUE.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. "BIG WOBBLY SPUNK BOMB" IS THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF LI, LI.
WELL, YOU CAN RAPE TOO MUCH.
Jon: UNLESS MEN ARE AROUND. AND IT'S NATURE.
AND THERE'S ANOTHER TRUTH. SORRY ABOUT THIS. I'M PLUGGING SOMETHING HERE BUT YOU CAN GO ON BUT THEY ALSO... THEY TRY TO SHOW THEM PORN TO GET THEM...
Jon: PANDAS?
YES.
Jon: PANDA PORN OR PORN/PORN.
I ASSUME IT WAS PANDAS AS OPPOSED TO TWO HUMANS. (LAUGHTER) BUT THAT'S A GOOD POINT. IF IT'S PANDAS SHAGGING JUST GET THOSE TO BE THE BREEDING PAIR. IF THEY'RE ALREADY AT IT, THEY'RE FINE. WHY DO THEY WANT SOMEONE ELSE WATCHING IT.
Jon: DO YOU THINK IT'S C.G.I.? ONE OF THOSE THINGS THEY DO IN LIKE LUCASFILM COMES IN AND  THEY'RE LIKE "LET'S HAVE THE PANDA EJACULATE FIRST." OR.
OR TWO OUT-OF-WORK ACTORS IN PANDA COSTUMES. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WHO'S THE GUY WHO PLAYS GOLLUM SANDY... >>ER IS KISS.
Jon: ANDY SERKIS COULD DO AN AWARD WINNING PANDA (BLEEP).
OH, YEAH!
Jon: I JUST MADE THAT NOISE AS THOUGH THAT'S WHAT PANDAS DO.
DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE TASTEFUL OR...
Jon: NO, NO. I THINK TASTEFUL PORN PANDA WOULD WORK EARLY ON BUT IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH US. IN THE OLD DAYS YOU'D FIND A SEARS CATALOG WITH A PICTURE OF  A BRA AND YOU'D GO "I'M GONNA (BLEEP) OFF FOR DAYS. " NOW IT REALLY IS... AT LEAST FOR ME IT'S NOT PANDAS  (BLEEP)ING IT'S NOTHING FOR ME.
YOU GO IN THERE AND GO "YOU GOT SOMETHING ELSE?" YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THAT. RACCOONS, EVERYTHING. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS. WHAT IS THIS? BECAUSE I DON'T... AND THIS IS... I'M NOT GOING TO PUT IT  OUT THERE AND SAY I'M A BIG AFICIONADO OF THE SEXUAL ARTS  BUT I'VE BEEN MASTURBATING FOR A LONG TIME... (LAUGHTER). I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS.
THAT WASN'T ME SAYING I'VE GOT A HUG GIRTH AND THAT'S HOW I MASTURBATE.
Jon: SO IS THIS YOU HOLDING A RACK DISMOON.
YES! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OKAY, I'M FINE. I'M FINE WITH THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: LET THE RECORD STATE..
NO, IT WASN'T ME RAPING A RACCOON. I WASN'T RAPING IT! IT WAS CONSENSUAL SEX WITH THE RACCOON. BUT I WAS A PANDA SO IT WASN'T BESTIALITY, IT WAS JUST INTERSPECIES CONSENSUAL SEX. THE PANDA WAS GOING LOOK AT THAT (BLEEP)ING (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SO, SEE, HERE'S WHAT... OKAY... ALL OF A SUDDEN  WHEN IT'S THE PANDA IT'S WITH ONE HAND BUT WHEN IT'S YOU...
(LAUGHS).
Jon: THE PANDA DOES IT WITH ONE HAND BUT RICKY GERVAIS "GIVE ME THAT RACCOON! COME ON!"
THIS ISN'T GOING OUT ON TELEVISION. THIS IS NOT GOING OUT ON TELEVISION. NO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW WHY PANDAS AND RACCOONS HAVE BLACK EYES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT IS TERRIBLE.
Jon: ANYWAY, MY POINT IS RICKY GERVAIS HAS A NEW SHOW ON HBO. (LAUGHTER) IT'S CALLED...
OH, YEAH, "LIFE'S TOO SHORT" ON HBO THIS SUNDAY AT 10:30. BEFORE THAT I'M ON "FAMILY GUY" AND BEFORE THAT ON SATURDAY I'M  DOING THINGS ON THE SCIENCE CHANNEL.
Jon: I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THINGS WITH MARSUPIALS BUT ALL RIGHT. "LIFE'S TOO SHORT" HBO SUNDAYS, FEBRUARY 19 AT 10:30 P.M. AND I THINK IF THAT'S NOT A SCREEN GRAB FOR SOMEBODY FOR  VALENTINE'S DAY, RICKY GERVAIS HUMP AGO
