REPORTS THAT CHINA'S MILITARY RAN A SUCCESSFUL FIRST TEST  FLIGHT OF A NEW STEALTH FIGHTER JET.
IT COULD END UP BAG MAJOR CHALLENGE TO U.S. AIR SUPERIORITY.
IT'S CALLED THE J-20 AND ANALYSTS SAY IT WOULD BE A  STRONG RIVAL TO AMERICA'S F-22 STEALTH FIGHTER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S IT? STEALTH FIGHTER? THAT'S THE BLES YOU GOT? GOOD LUCK WITH IT. I THINK WE HAVE A STEALTH FIGHTER AS WELL. I THINK JASON JONES MIGHT BE STANDING BY WITH IT. HEY, JASON.

(APPLAUSE) BUT SERIOUSLY, CONGRATULATIONS, CHINA, ON DEVELOPING THE STEALTH FIGHTER.
Jon: WE'RE NUMBER ONE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, JON, THE ULTIMATE IRONY HERE IS THAT THE CHINESE  HAVE HAD THIS TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE STEALTH PLANES FOR YEARS. FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU GO TO THE GIFT SHOP OF THE INTREPID TO BUY THE MODEL OF THE STEALTH PLANE, FLIP IT OVER, AND IT READS "MADE IN CHINA." (LAUGHTER)
