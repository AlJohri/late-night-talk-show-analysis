READY TO GO. READY TO GO. READY TO GO.
OCTOBER 19, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAIL SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. REVEREND AL SHARPTON WILL BE JOINING US LATER, BUT FIRST, LAST NIGHT WAS THE EIGHTH AND IN NO WAY FINAL REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, SPONSORED  BY THE WESTERN REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE AND CNN.
THE WEST, THE MOUNTAIN MAJESTY OF THE ROCKIES TO THE DESERT SANDS OF THE MOJAVE, NOW  WITH NOTHING LESS THAN AMERICA'S FUTURE AT STAKE, THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN GOES WEST.
Jon: YES, NOTHING SAYS AMERICAN WEST LIKE THE VENETIAN HOTEL'S GONDOLIERS, PADDLING  PREDEBATE DOWN THE VEGAS STRIP'S FAMED RIVER OF TEARS AND UNSIGHTLY DISCHARGE. [LAUGHTER] WELCOME, TOURISTS, TO THE VENETIAN HERPES CREEK. BUT ON TO THE DEBATE. THE WHOLE GANG WAS THERE EXCEPT JON HUNTSMAN, SO WHO CARES. CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN, WHO HAVING APPARENTLY UNTANGLED THE ARMS OF HER STRAITJACKET SET OUT TO SHOW THAT EVEN IN A TIGHT  FIELD NO ONE PUTS CRAZY IN A CORNER.
I WAS THE VERY FIRST CANDIDATE THAT SIGNED A PLEDGE THAT SAID THAT BY A DATE CERTAIN  I WILL BUILD A DOUBLE-WALLED FENCE WITH AN AREA OF SECURITY NEUTRALITY IN BETWEEN.
Jon: DOUBLE WALL! SINGLE WALL CAN'T GET THE JOB DONE, BUT THE DOUBLE WALL. MICHELE BACHMANN FORMS HER IMMIGRATION POLICY THE WAY GILLETTE COMES UP WITH NEW RAZORS. THE FIRST WALL STRETCHES THE IMMIGRANT OUT. THE SECOND WALL CUTS THEM OFF AT THE ROOTS. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE LUBRICATING STRIP DOES. RON PAUL WAS THERE TO REMIND PEOPLE WHAT UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE FEELS LIKE.
I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION: ARE YOU ALL WILLING TO CUT DOWN RONALD REAGAN FOR EXCHANGING  WEAPONS FOR HOSTAGES OUT OF IRAN. WE ALL KNOW THAT WAS DONE.
Jon: ANYONE? ANYONE IN? RONALD REAGAN NEGOTIATED WITH TERRORISTS? ANYONE? ALL RIGHT, [BLEEPED] IT, HOW ABOUT WE FILL THE RIO GRANDE WITH LAVA. HOW ABOUT THAT? BUT ENOUGH OF THE NICETIES. LET'S GET READY TO ROMNEY.
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME SPEAK.
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO CHANGE --
RICK, YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE. WHY DON'T YOU LET ME SPEAK. YOU GOT IT FROM THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION.
YOU JUST SAID IT'S NOT TRUE. IF IT'S IN YOUR BOOK...
YOU TOOK IT OUT OF YOUR BOOK. LET'S BE HONEST. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: YOU SEE THAT WOMAN'S LOOK OF SHOCK. DO YOU SEE THE LOOK OF SHOCK? DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET A LOOK OF SHOCK FROM SOMEONE IN LAS VEGAS. [LAUGHTER] IT'S LAS VEGAS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL A SHOW GIRL [BLEEPED] A PENGUIN IN LAS VEGAS? TUESDAY. BUT THE EVENING WAS MOSTLY ABOUT CANDIDATES ANSWERING FOR THEIR PAST STATEMENTS. FOR HERMAN CAIN IT WAS HIS 999 TAX REFORM PLAN WHICH CAME UNDER HEAVY ATTACKMENT
REPORTS ARE OUT THAT 84% OF AMERICANS WOULD PAY MORE TAXES UNDER HIS PLAN.
HERMAN, I LOVE YOU, BROTHER, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING: YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A BIG ANALYSIS TO FIGURE THIS THING OUT. WE'LL BUMP PLANS AND WE'LL SEE WHO HAS THE BEST IDEA ABOUT HOW  YOU GET THIS COUNTRY WORKING AGAIN.
Jon: I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD DO THE "BROTHER" THING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [WHISPERING] I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO BE ALL HEY, BROTHER, WITH HERMAN. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER, BUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THERE WAS THIS DISCLOSURE THAT YOU LEASED A RANCH CALLED... CALLED... HERMAN, HERMAN...
THE NAME OF THE PLACE WAS CALLED NIGGERHEAD.
Jon: [WHISPERING] RIGHT. SO I'D GO EASY ON THAT "BROTHER"  [BLEEPED]. BUT TO PERRY'S POINT THAT CAIN'S 9% FEDERAL SALES TAX WOULD  IMPOSE AN ADDITIONAL COST ON TOP OF STATE SALES TAX, WELL, CAIN HAD A SIMPLE RESPONSE.
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF MIXING APPLES AND ORANGES. THE STATE TAX IS AN APPLE. WE ARE REPLACING THE CURRENT TAX CODE WITH ORANGES.
HERMAN, ARE YOU SAYING THAT STATE SALES TAX WILL ALSO GO AWAY.
NO, THAT'S AN APPLE.
OH, OKAY. WE'RE REPLACING A BUNCH OF ORANGES.
WILL THE PEOPLE IN NEVADA NOT HAVE TO PAY NEVADA SALES TAX AND IN ADDITION PAY THE 9% TAX.
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO PAY THAT. THAT'S APPLES AND ORANGES.
AND I'M GOING TO GET A BUSHELL BASKET WITH APPLES AND ORANGES. AND PEOPLE IN NEVADA DON'T WANT TO PAY BOTH TAXES.
Jon: HEY, HERMAN CAIN, YOU LIKE APPLES? DAWES YOU JUST GOT WICKED SCHOOLED BY THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS. HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM [BLEEPED] APPLES. AHHHH! THANK YOU. THAT WAS MY ONE-MAN SHOW IDEA GOOD WILL HUNTING" THE APPLE SCENE. BUT OF COURSE ROMNEY IS THE FRONT-RUNNER. HERE HE IS DEFENDING ROMNEY CARE, WHICH, AS YOU KNOW, IS IDENTICAL TO IT BUT IN NO WAY  HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH OBAMA CARE.
ACTUALLY, NEWTON, WE GOT THE IDEA OF AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE FROM YOU. SORRY, RICK, THAT YOU FIND SO MUCH TO DISLIKE IN MY PLAN, BUT THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS LIKE  IT BY ABOUT A 3-1 MARGIN. WAS IT SOMETHING I'D IMPOSE ON THE NATION? THE ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY NOT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO TO SUMMARIZE ROMNEY CARE: IT'S A GREAT REPUBLICAN IDEA THAT WORKS GREAT. THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS LOVE IT. I WOULD NEVER DO IT AGAIN. IT'S SOCIALISM. BUT THE REAL FIREWORKS CAME WHEN... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE REAL FIREWORKS CAME WHEN THE TWO SILVERBACKS, ROMNEY AND PERRY, WENT MANO A MANO ON THE  SUBJECT OF PEOPLE WHOSE NATIVE TONGUE GAVE US THE PHRASE "MANO A MANO."
MITT, YOU LOSE ALL OF YOUR STANDING FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE YOU HIRED ILLEGALS IN  YOUR HOME AND YOU KNEW ABOUT IT FOR A YEAR.
I DON'T THINK THAT I'VE EVER HIRED AN ILLEGAL IN MY LIFE, SO  I'M AFRAID... I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO FINDING YOUR FACTS ON THAT BECAUSE THAT...
RICK, AGAIN, I'M SPEAKING. I'M SPEAKING.
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE YOUR HANDS. I WOULD HATE TO BE ABLE TO ZOOM IN RIGHT NOW AND SEE WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE RICK PERRY'S HEAD. [APPLAUSE] TO BE FAIR... TO BE FAIR, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT IS THE CLIP THAT IS ALWAYS PLAYING  INSIDE RICK PERRY'S HEAD. [LAUGHTER] BUT MITT ROMNEY WASN'T DONE MESSING WITH TEXAS.
WE HIRED A LAWN COMPANY TO MOW OUR LAWN. AND THEY HAD ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT WERE WORKING THERE, AND WHEN THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO US, WE LET THEM GO. WE WENT TO THEM AND SAID...
ARE YOU LICENSED?
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ALLOWING SOMEONE TO FINISH SPEAKING. AND I SUGGEST IF YOU WANT TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU HAVE TO LET BOTH  PEOPLE SPEAK, SO LET ME SPEAK.
Jon: YEAH. RICK PERRY, I THINK MITT ROMNEY HAD SOMETHING FOR YOU RIGHT HERE. LET ME GET IT FOR YOU. IT'S COMING RIGHT NOW. BOOM. THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL THE MORMON BIRD. IT'S NOT... SOMETIMES... OH, NO, HE COULD HAVE DOUBLED DOWN. SOMETIMES THEY'LL BE ALL LIKE, OH, WHAT'S THAT? UH-UH, NO OKAY, NOT OKAY. IT'S OKAY WITH A FLASH-THROUGH. YOU CAN'T [BLEEPED] WITH MORMON HAND SIGNALS. BUT IT WAS HERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AROUND MINUTE 58 OF THE EIGHTH REPUBLICAN  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, THAT MITT ROMNEY WAS EXPLAINING WHY IT WAS THAT HE NO LONGER ALLOWED  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THE PRIVILEGE OF MOWING HIS LAWN THAT HE GAVE AWAY WHAT WE IN THE BUSINESS  CALL "THE GAME."
WE WENT TO THE COMPANY AND WE SAID, "LOOK, YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY  ILLEGALS WORKING ON OUR PROPERTY. I'M RUNNING FOR OFFICE FOR PETE'S SAKE."
Jon: BELIEVE ME, IF I WASN'T RUNNING FOR OFFICE, I WOULDN'T GIVE A FLYING... PAY  'EM $2. IT'S NOT PRINCIPLE. I GOT PEOPLE WATCHING ME. MITT, IF I MAY... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IF I MAY GIVE YOU A PIECE OF CAMPAIGN ADVICE, THERE IS NO STORY THAT MAKES YOU LOOK GOOD  THAT INVOLVES YOU SAYING, "I'M RUNNING FOR OFFICE, FOR PETE'S SAKE."  THAT'S WHEN I STOOD UP STRAYING AND I SAID, GET THIS BALLOON FULL OF COCAINE OUT OF MY ASS. I'M RUNNING FOR OFFICE FOR PETE'S SAKE. GET THIS DOG OFF MY PENIS. I'M RUNNING FOR OFFICE FOR GOODNESS SAKE. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE BEST ABOUT THAT JOKE, MITT ROMNEY'S SURPRISE ON HAVING THE DOG ON  HIS PENIS. WELL, YOU SLATHER A LITTLE BIT OF PEANUT BUTTER DOWN THERE AND GOD KNOWS WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS. SERIOUSLY. THAT "FOR PETE'S SAKE I'M RUNNING FOR OFFICE" MAY BE THE  MOST HONEST THING MITT ROMNEY HAS EVER SAID, BECAUSE I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT'S WHAT HE  WAS THINKING AT THAT TIME. FOR JUST A MOMENT IT FELT LIKE THE GUARD DROPPED AND WE ALL GOT TO SEE THE TINY HUMAN BEING THAT  RESIDES INSIDE THE SKULL OF THE GIANT ROBOT BODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BAC
