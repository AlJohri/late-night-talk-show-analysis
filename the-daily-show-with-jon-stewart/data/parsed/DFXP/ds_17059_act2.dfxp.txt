Jon: WELCOME BACK. FEBRUARY, OF COURSE, IS BLACK HISTORY MONTH. HERE TO LEND US HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THIS SPECIAL EVENT, DAILY SHOW SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE. LARRY, THANKS FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANKS, JON. THANK YOU, JON. THE YEAR WAS 1885. A YOUNG FARMER NAMED GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER OVERCAME-- I'M SORRY, JON, I HAVE TO STOP. I CAN'T SPEND ANOTHER FEBRUARY TALKING ABOUT HOW BLACK PEOPLE INVENTED PEANUT  BUTTER AND RADDIUM.
Jon: I THINK RADDIUM WAS A FRENCH LADY.
WHATEVER. LOOK, THE REAL ISSUE RIGHT NOW IS HOW CAN IT BE THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF BLACK HISTORY  MONTH AN ASIAN KID COMES IN AND DOES THIS.
JEREMY LYNN THE NBA'S NEWEST SUPERSTAR.
HIS LEDGE ON OF FANS CALLING THIS LYNN-SANITY.
A LINDRELA STORY.
EVERYBODY LOVES A LINER.
HEY, I GOT ONE, YOU'RE KILLING ME. THIS IS MORE PAINFUL THAN A LIN GROWN TOE NAIL. HERE'S A GREAT ONE. I HATE JEREMY LIN.
Jon: NOW WAIT, YOU'RE UP SET BECAUSE AN ASIAN PERSON, AN ASIAN AMERICAN IS EXCELLING AT A TRADITIONALLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN SPORT.
JON, NO, I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS NOT HAPPEN. LOOK AT CARMELLO AN THONNEE. HE CAN'T EVEN BRING HIMSELF TO PUT ON HIS UNIFORM.
Jon: HE'S HURT. HE'S HURT.
JON, I WOULD BE HURT TOO. HAVE YOUR JOB OUTSOURCED TO ASIA RIGHT IN YOUR FACE.
Jon: NO, THEY, THEY DON'T EVEN PLAY THE SAME POSITION. AND JEREMY LIN HAS HAD TO OVERCOME A GREAT DEAL TO GET WHERE HE IS. I THOUGHT AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN, THAT YOU OF ALL PEOPLE COULD APPRECIATE THAT.
NO, JON, DON'T REDUCE THIS TO A DISCUSSION ABOUT MY RACE. THIS IS ABOUT HIS RACE. OKAY? AND YOU KNOW, OKAY, HE'S HAD SOME STRUGGLES.
LIN MAJORED IN ECONOMICS, GRADUATED WITH A 3.1 GPA.
SERIOUSLY, 3. -- THAT'S AN ASIAN F. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.
I GET IT, I GET IT LOOK, CLEARLY THE BASKETBALL IS JUST AN ATTEMPT TO WIN BACK THE LOVE OF HIS TIGER MOM, YOU KNOW? HEY, THAT-- .
Jon: I CANNOT EVEN BELIEVE, WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU.
JON, IT IS JUST ANOTHER THING THAT GOT TAKEN FROM US, JAZZ, ROCK 'N' ROLL, EBONICS. NOW BASKETBALL?
Jon: NOTHING IS BEING TAKEN, LARRY.
OH, REALLY?
I FEEL LIKE I'M STILL LIVING A DREAM. I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A DREAM RIGHT NOW.
YOU HAVE A DREAM? (LAUGHTER) NO, NO, NO.
Jon: WAIT FOR IT, WAIT FOR IT.
NICKERBOCKER, PLEASE. SLOW DOWN MARTIN LUTHER KUNG POW.
Jon: LARRY, AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BEEN DOING VERY, VERY WELL, LATELY. THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
YEAH, FOR HOW LONG.
Jon: TIGER WOODS.
YEAH, ASIAN SIDE LIKES GOLF, HIS BLACK SIDE LIKES TRASHY WHITE GIRLS.
Jon: LARRY, IT'S NOT LIKE BLACK PLAYERS ARE GOING TO DISAPPEAR BECAUSE AN ASIAN  GUY IS IN THE LEAGUE.
WELL, REALLY, THEN TELL ME THIS, JON, WHO WAS THE FIRST PRO BASKETBALL PLAYERS?
Jon: WHITE GUYS, I GUESS.
NO, NO, WHITE JEWS.
Jon: WHAT.
IMMIGRANT JEWS DOMINATED THE FIRST PRO BASKETBALL LEAGUE, THE CLEVELAND ROSENBLOOMS.
Jon: THAT CANNOT BE TRUE.
I CAN'T MAKE THAT [BLEEP] UP JON. LOOK, THEY EVEN HAD THEIR OWN UNIFORMS.
Jon: OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT IS SURPASS BEING THAT PICTURE, GYMS ARE VERY DRAFTY AND YOU WOULD  HAVE THINK THEY WHAT HAVE HAD LONGER SLEEVES BECAUSE JEWS TRADITIONALLY VERY PRONE TO COLDS.
THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS. JEWISH BASKETBALL PLAYERS WERE REPLACED BY GENTILES THEN US AND UNLESS WE DO  SOMETHING QUICK, NOW IT'S GOING TO BE ASIANS.
Jon: BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO.
JON, DON'T WORRY, I MAY HAVE A SOLUTION. PRETTY SURE THIS WHOLE ASIAN BASKETBALL INVASION MIGHT BE REVENGE FOR A KNEEL DEGRASS TYSON.
Jon: THE ASTROPHYSICIST.
EXACTLY.
WHAT WAS HE THINKING, SCIENCE, THAT'S ASIAN TURF. BUT, I HAVE CONFERED WITH THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND WE'RE OFFICIALLY ASKING  MR. TYSON TO STOP IT. DON'T WORRY, JON, HE'LL BE FINE. WE'LL PUT HIM IN A SITCOM, MAKE HIM A FUNNY, YEAH, MAKE HIM A FUNNY DAD ON BET. HE'LL MAKE 40 TIMES THE MONEY, I'M TELLING YOU. JUST GIVE US BACK THE ROCK. WE'LL CALL IT EBLIN.
Jon: LARRY WILMORE,
