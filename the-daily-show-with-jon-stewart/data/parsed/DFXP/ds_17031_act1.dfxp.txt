FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU. YOU KNOW WHO IS HERE TONIGHT? YOU KNOW WHO IS HERE TONIGHT? RALPH FIENNES IS GOING TO BE HERE TONIGHT, RALPH FIENNES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE GOING TO TALK CRAFT, ACTING CRAFT, HE AND I. WELL, HE IS. I'M JUST GOING TO REMIND HIM I WAS IN "HALF-BAKED." ALL RIGHT. LET'S START IN WASHINGTON WHERE LAST WEEK THE SENATE PASSED THE 2011 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS  BILL, WHICH AUTHORIZED ALL THE MONEY FOR OUR ARMED FORCES BY A WHOPPING 93-7. OF COURSE, THE DEFENSE PROBATIONS BILL IS ONE OF THOSE MUST-PASS PIECES OF LEGISLATION. EVERY YEAR YOU ALWAYS SEE SOME CRAZY PROVISION SOMEONE SNEAKS IN THERE, LIKE IN 2007 IT WAS  INTELLIGENT CLOTHING. WE WERE GOING TO PAY TO DEVELOP CLOTHING THAT DETECTS CHEMICAL ATTACKS. IN 2009 IT WAS HAWAIIAN HEALTH CARE NETWORK, AND, OF COURSE, LAST YEAR THE FLYING BULLDOZER. IT'S UNNECESSARY. [LAUGHTER] SEE WHAT WACKY PROVISIONS GOT FOLDED INTO THIS YEAR'S BILL.
THE PROVISIONS AUTHORIZE THE INDEFINITE MILITARY DETENTION OF AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO ARE  SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM, EVEN THOSE CAPTURED HERE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY, IN THE  UNITED STATES, WHICH I THINK SHOULD CONCERN EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US.
Jon: YES. I AGREE WITH YOU. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS SOMEWHAT CONCERNING, A BILL THAT ALLOWS THE GOVERNMENT TO LOCK UP AN AMERICAN CITIZEN  INDEFINITELY, WITHOUT A TRIAL, THUS APPARENTLY NULLIFYING THE FOURTH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION. I CAN SEE WHY SEVEN SENATORS VOTED AGAINST IT. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE'D HAVE LIKE NINE OR A BAKER'S DOZEN, BUT ALL RIGHT. CAN ONLY IMAGINE, THOUGH, THE SENATE DEBATE ON THE BILL WAS PRETTY PITCHED.
WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY A HALF HOUR ON EACH SIDE. I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH SENATOR GRAHAM NEEDS.
TEN MINUTES. IS THAT TOO MUCH, FIVE MINUTES?
CAN YOU DO FIVE MINUTES?
SEVEN.
I THINK WE HAVE SEVEN SPEAKERS ON THIS SIDE.
I'LL TRY TO BE QUICK.
TRY TO DO EIGHT MINUTES.
I'LL TRY TO DO IT AS QUICK AS I CAN.
JON: I CAN ELIMINATE THAT FREEDOM IN SIX MINUTES. I CAN ELIMINATE THAT FREEDOM IN FIVE. ELIMINATE THAT FREEDOM. EACH SIDE IN THIS DEBATE HAD HALF AN HOUR. FOR THE DEBATE ON ELIMINATING ONE OF THE MOST BASIC PROTECTIONS OF CITIZENSHIP, WE  REQUIRE AT LEAST, AT LEAST A RUNNING TIME OF "TWO BROKE GIRLS."  [LAUGHTER] INCLUDING COMMERCIALS. THIS IS NOT A BANANA REPUBLIC. WOULD IT BE ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE THE CASE AGAINST THE BILL? RAND PAUL OF KENTUCKY, GO.
DETAINING CITIZENS WITHOUT A COURT TRIAL IS NOT AMERICAN.
Jon: OH, I DIDN'T EVEN CLICK THE START BUTTON YET. WOW, THAT'S A PRETTY PERSUASIVE CASE AGAINST. WHAT'S THE CASE FOR?
IF THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY WANTS TO HAVE A SITUATION PREVAIL WHERE PEOPLE ARE  RELEASED AND GO BACK IN THE FIGHT AND KILL AMERICANS, HE'S ENTITLED TO THAT OPINION.
Jon: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS. THAT IS THE JEWISH GRANDMOTHERY-IST ARGUMENT I HAVE EVER HEARD FOR INDEFINITE  DETENTION OF AMERICAN CITIZENS. [IN JEWISH ACCENT]: IF THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY WANTS THAT BAD PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO  KILL US, I THINK THEY SHOULDN'T BUT WHAT DO I KNOW? I'M JUST AN OLD MAN WITH ANGER MANAGEMENT ISSUES. I DON'T KNOW. SPEAKING OF JEWISH GRANDMOTHERS, WHAT DOES SENATOR CARL LEVIN THINK OF THIS BILL?
AL QAEDA IS AT WAR WITH US. THEY BROUGHT THAT WAR TO OUR SHORES.
Jon: DO YOU THINK WE WANT TO KEEP AMERICANS IN PRISON FOREVER? OF COURSE WE DON'T. THIS HURTS US MORE THAN THEM. LET'S HEAR A LESS JEWISH ARGUMENT.
WE'RE FACING AN ENEMY, NOT A COMMON CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION, WHO WILL DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO DESTROY OUR WAY OF LIFE.
Jon: SO WE'RE GOING TO DESTROY IT BEFORE THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON IT. YOU CAN TAKE AWAY OUR LIVES, BUT ONLY WAY WE CAN TAKE AWAY OUR FREEDOM MMMMMM. [IN EXAGGERATED SOUTHERN ACCENT] LOOK, WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING UP WITH THIS CYNICAL FEAR MONGERING FOR TEN YEARS NOW. IF YOU WANT US TO PUNT OUR RIGHT TO DEW DUE PROCESS, WE NEED MORE PURE CONDI SENSE.
WHEN YOU JOIN AL QAEDA, YOU'RE JOINING PEOPLE WHO ARE BENT ON OUR DESTRUCTION AND WHO ARE A MILITARY THREAT.
Jon: BULL [BLEEPED]. AL QAEDA WISHES IT KILLED AS MANY AMERICANS AS OUR GANGS DO. [LAUGHTER] THEY WISH THEY WERE THAT GOOD AT KILLING AMERICANS. SINCE 9/11, OUR GANGS HAVE KILLED LIKE 10,000 AMERICANS. IT'S ALMOST LIKE LINDSEY GRAHAM IS TRYING TO GET THE HEAT OFF OF GANGS. ZOOM IN ON HIS FACE. SON OF A BITCH! I KNEW IT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] GRAHAM! LINDSEY GRAHAM IS A CLOSETED GANGBANGER. I'M NOT SUGGESTING HE BANGS GANGS. I'M SAYING, ISN'T THERE ANYONE WHO CAN DERAIL THIS ONE-WAY TRAIN TO GITMO? YOU KNOW, I SEEM TO RECALL A PROMISING YOUNG MAN WHO ONCE MADE AN EL QN CASE FOR OUR VALUES.
WE'RE NOT A COUNTRY THAT RUNS PRISONS THAT LOCKS PEOPLE AWAY  WITHOUT EVER TELLING THEM WHY THEY'RE THERE OR WHAT THEY'RE CHARGED WITH. WE'RE NOT A NATION THAT LOCKS PEOPLE UP WITHOUT CHARGING THEM.
Jon: BY I'M GOING TO WORK TO CHANGE THAT. REMEMBER THAT GUY? I LOVED THAT GUY. I THINK HE WAS IN SOMETHING RECENTLY. THE WHITE HOUSE. [LAUGHTER] I'M SURE THAT HIS PRESS SECRETARY CAN EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHY OUR PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING  TO SIGN THIS AUTHORITARIAN PIECE OF...
ANY BILL THAT CHALLENGES OR CON TRAINS THE PRESIDENT'S  CRITICAL ABILITIES TO INCAPACITY DANGEROUS TERRORISTS AND PROTECT THE NATION WOULD PROMPT HIS  SENIOR ADVISERS TO RECOMMEND A VETO.
Jon: CHALLENGE, CONSTRAINTS? YOU GOT THAT? OBAMA IS GOING TO VETO THIS NOT BECAUSE HE OBJECTS TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAVING NEAR  INFINITE POWER TO DETAIN WHOEVER IT WANTS, BUT BECAUSE HE OBJECTS TO THE EXECUTIVE NOT HAVING  TOTALLY INFINITE POWER. APPARENTLY THERE IS A PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT SAYS THE PRESIDENT MUST DETAIN FOREIGN  TERROR SUSPECTS IN ONLY MILITARY CUSTODY, UNLESS HE HAS A WAIVER. HE'S GOT TO ISSUE A WAIVER. THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO VETO THIS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO DO ANY PAPERWORK. [LAUGHTER] TO BE FAIR, IF YOU DO FIND YOURSELF SUDDENLY AND PERHAPS CAPRICIOUSLY BENEATH THIS BILL, YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE YOUR STATUS REVIEWED ONCE A  YEAR, AND, B, THEY COULDN'T HOLD YOU INDEFINITELY, JUST UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR. SO WHEN THE WAR ON TERROR ENDS, AND TERROR SURRENDERS... [LAUGHTER] AND IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AS A HUMAN EMOTION, YOU'RE FREE TO GO. YOU MIGHT BE THINKING, WELL, THIS LAW IN NO WAY APPLIES TO ME BECAUSE I AM IN THE A TERRORIST. WELL, LUCKILY YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE. YOU JUST HAVE TO BE SUSPECTED OF SUPPORTING OR AIDING ONE, AND YOU MAY BE THINKING THAT THAT IN  NO WAY APPLIES TO YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T GO TO TERRORIST MEETINGS. OR SEND TERRORIST MAIL. WELL, SUPPORT IS A PRETTY BROAD TERM.
THERE ARE LAWS ON THE BOOKS NOW THAT CHARACTERIZE WHO MIGHT BE A TERRORIST. SOMEONE MISSING FINGERS ON THEIR HAND IS A SUSPECT ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. SOMEONE WHO HAS GUNS, SOMEONE WHO HAS AMMUNITION THAT IS WEATHER-PROOFED, SOMEONE WHO HAS  MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS OF FOOD IN THEIR HOUSE CAN BE CONSIDERED A POTENTIAL TERRORIST.
MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS OF FOOD? MY BEANS, MY, MY BELOVED BEANS. MAYBE NOT NOW, BUT IN THE FUTURE EXECUTIVE POWER LIKE THIS COULD BE EXERCISED VERY BROADLY, A  COMPLETELY INNOCENT PERSON WHO MAY HAVE AS A CHILD ATTENDED A MA DR. IS A OR LATER ATTENDED EVENTS WITH MEMBERS OF A KNOWN TERRORIST GROUP OR SAT WITH  RADICAL CLERICS AND TO THIS DAY ASSOCIATES WITH A MAN WITHOUT ALL HIS FINGERS, THAT PERSON  COULD BE SUBJECT TO INDEFINITE -- OH, MY GOD! PRESIDENT OBAMA.
IT'S A TRAP.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
