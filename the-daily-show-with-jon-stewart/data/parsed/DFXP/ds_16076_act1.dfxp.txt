JUNE 13th, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, I'M JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT-- MY GUEST TONIGHT ALEX PRUD'HOMME, AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK ABOUT THE SCARCITY OF WATER. BUT OBVIOUSLY THE TOP STORY TONIGHT, NEW ZEALAND POLITICS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LIKE A HALF HOUR CONVERSATION BEFORE THE SHOW  WITH THIS LADY ABOUT NEW ZEALAND POLITICS. IT WAS SO INTRICATE. SO HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE THERE, SHE'S LIKE 13.
WELL, SO DOESN'T EVERYBODY GET ELECTED IT? HEY, REMEMBER-- TONIGHT'S AUDIENCE BIG FANS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM. REMEMBER WHEN SARAH PALIN TOOK THAT EAST COAST CONSTITUTION BUS TOUR MEETING HONEST, HARDWORKING  AMERICANS AND DONALD TRUMP? (LAUGHTER) YOU DON'T REMEMBER? WELL ARC PARENTLY SHE WAS TRAVELING WITH A PRO BECAUSE PALIN AND HER POLITICAL  ACTION COMMITTEE HAVE TURNED AROUND IN JUST ONE WEEK THE MOST OVERPRODUCED VACATION I  IMOVIE OF ALL TIME.
THIS WEEK OF TOURING HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BEST WEEKS OF MY LIFE.
SARAH PALIN ROLLED INTO THE BELLY OF THE BEAST. MAMA GRIZZLY IN WASHINGTON.
WE'RE HIGHLIGHTING WHAT IT IS THAT BUILT AMERICA, OUR STRONG FOUNDATION. EVEN THE BUS HAS GOT THE WORDS FROM THE PREAMBLE OF THE CONSTITUTION, WE THE PEOPLE ON IT. SO THAT WE CAN TELL THE REST OF AMERICA HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE KNOW WHAT OUR  FOUNDATION IS ALL ABOUT.
HOPEFULLY I CAN INSPIRE OTHERS IN ORDER TO AFFECT POSITIVE CHANGE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THESE'S-- SHE'S NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, SHE'S  RUNNING FOR RUSH MORE. (LAUGHTER) THE VIDEO PEERS TO DETAIL HOW THE HALF TERM ALASKAN GOVERNOR FIRST IMMIGRATED TO  THIS GREAT NATION, BEFORE SHE SIGNED THE CONSTITUTION, SHE RANG THE LIBERTY BELL AND THEN SHE KILLED A MAN AT ALTAMONT. ALL WHILE ONE COLDPLAY SOUND ALIKE SONG PLAYS. HOW PROPAGANDAI WAS IT, THEY FOUND SOUND BITES FROM LAME STREAM MEDIA REPORTERS WHILE  SMOOTHLY EDITING OUT SIGN OF THEIR BEWILDERMENT OR CONTEMPT.
AS THE TOUR ROLLS ON.
STOPPING AT HIS HISTORIC PLACES LIKE GETTYSBURG.
AND PHILADELPHIA TO SEE THE LIBERTY BELL.
TODAY TO ELLIS ISLAND IN NEW YORK.
AND THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.
I GUARANTEE YOU THERE IS AN EDITING ROOM FLOOR LITTERED WITH PHRASES LIKE FOR SOME REASON. AND "WHY? YOU KNOW WHAT WAS COOL, MAN? THE WAY THEY HAVE REPORTERS FINISHING EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES. WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT TECHNIQUE BEFORE.
I HAVE GENITAL HERPES. AND I TRIED TO BE CAREFUL.
VERY CAREFUL.
VERY CAREFUL.
NOW I TAKE ONCE DAILY VALTREX TO REDUCE MY RISK OF PASSING IT ON. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE OLD FINISHING EACH OTHER'SS HERPES COMMERCIAL TECHNIQUE. WELL-- THEY BOTH APPEAR DURING TIMES OF STRESS. I WILL SAY THAT. WHY WOULD SARAH PALIN, WHY WOULD THIS PERSON THINK THAT WE'RE ALL BREATHILESSLY  AWAITING THE MUNDANE DETAILS ABOUT HER BUS TRIP? WHERE DID SHE GET THIS GROSSLY INFLATED SENSE OF HER OWN IMPORTANCE. LIKE WE'RE HANGING ON EVERY WORD SHE'S EVER SAID OR WRITTEN.
WE'RE LIVE IN ALASKA WHERE THOUSANDS OF HER E-MAILS AS GOVERNOR THERE  WILL BE RELEASED BEFORE TODAY.
OH, RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) SHE GOT THAT IDEA BECAUSE WE ARE. (LAUGHTER)
YES, EVERY NEGATIVE NIFERNS THAT SARAH PALIN HAS EVER MADE ABOUT THE  LAMESTREAM MEDIA WAS ON FULL DISPLAY LAST FRIDAY AS THE STATE OF ALASKA RELEASED  E-MAILS FROM HER TERM AS GOVERNOR IN RESPONSE TO A TWO-YEAR-OLD FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST. AND THE MEDIA WANT FULL TEAM COVERAGE ON THE ARBITRARY RELEASE DATE OF NONURGENT MATERIAL.
JUST HOURS FROM NOW ALASKA WILL RELEASE THOUSAND OF PAGES OF SARAH PALIN'S E-MAILS.
THEY WILL BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS.
IT IS LESS THAN AN HOUR AWAY.
LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM NOW.
WE ARE MOMENTS AWAY FROM THE RELEASE OF MORE THAN 24,000 PAGES OF E-MAILS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: YES N JUST SECONDS PERHAPS WE WILL FINALLY KNOW JUST WHY-- OH [BLEEP], THERE'S NO REAL REASON TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS NOW. BUT FOR SOME REASON THE MEDIA WENT TO DEFINITE CON 1 FOR THE RELEASE OF THE NONPENTAGON PAPERS.
WHAT IS EXPECTED IN THESE E-MAILS.
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TO LEARN FROM THESE E-MAILS.
SOMETHING ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIPS.
HOW HER HUSBAND IN PARTICULAR GOT INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF STATE GOVERNMENT.
SOME OF THOSE SCANDALS OR MINISCANDALS.
POTENTIALLY EMBARRASSING THINGS.
CONTROVERSIES LIKE TROOPER GAIT, QUESTIONS ABOUT HER DAUGHTER BRISTOL'S PREGNANCY.
WE ALSO WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU AS WELL.
WHAT NEW DETAILS DO YOU EXPECT TO SURFACE IN THE PALIN E-MAILS? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT IF THEY ARE ALL LIKE TWITTER [BLEEP] PICTURES, DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE? OH MY GOD, THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE! (LAUGHTER) OR MAYBE THEY'RE JUST THE BANNAL DAY-TO-DAY ACTIVITIES OF A WORKING MOM SLASH  GOVERNOR TRYING TO BALANCE FAMILY LIFE WITH A BURGEONING POLITICAL CAREER WHILE LOOKING FOR [BLEEP] PICTURES. (LAUGHTER) I WANT TO SEE THE E-MAILS! IN PREPARATION FOR WHAT NETWORKS HAD CONVINCED THEMSELVES WOULD BE A BOMBSHELL SCANDAL LEYDEN  TREASURE TROVE NEWS OUTLETS SCRAMBLED TEAMS TO ALASKA AND SOLICITED THEIR READERS  TO HELP THEM REVIEW THE PALIN E-MAILS. HOW DO YOU LIAR READING DAY LABOURERS? ARE THOSE FOLKS JUST GATHERED AT BARNS & NOBLE PARKING LOTS IN THE MORNING? (LAUGHTER) YOU PULL UP IN YOUR PICKUP. ANYONE WANT EIGHT HONEST HOURS OF READING WORK, GET IN. FINALLY AT 1 P.M. THE E-MAILS DROPPED. AND THE DETAILS, OH YEAH. (LAUGHTER)
DID NOT DISAPPOINT.
BOXES ARE PACKED WITH SINGLE SPACED BLACK INK ON WHITE PAPER AND THE DOCUMENTS ARE IN  CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER AND THE BOXES WEIGH 50 POUNDS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW, I THINK THE BOX OF PAPER WOULD WEIGH 50 POUNDS WHETHER THERE WERE  E-MAILS WRITTEN ON THEM OR NOT. (LAUGHTER) AND REALLY THE 50 POUND WAS ONLY BE NEWS ON MARS WHERE THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE WAS DIFFERENT. STILL, AFTER ALL THAT BUILDUP YOU HAVE TO ASSUME IT WAS PRETTY DEVASTATING  NEWSWORTHY STUFF IN THOSE E-MAILS. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
NOT A LOT OF SALACIOUS STUFF.
THIS ONE WHERE SHE IS DISCUSSING WHETHER OR NOT SHE'S GOING TO PARTICIPATE  IN A FITNESS MAGAZINE.
I CAME ACROSS WHERE WHERE WILL OWE PALIN GRABS HER MOM'S BLACKBERRY AND IS  ARRANGING A PLAY DATE.
IN THIS E-MAIL THAT I'M HOLDING HERE SOMEBODY IS COMPLAINING TO WALT -- THE  PUBLIC SAFETY DIRECTOR THAT SHE EVENTUALLY FIRED, A RETIRING LEGISLATOR SAYING  THAT SHE WAS SPOTTED WITH TRIG IN A CAR NOT WEARING AN APPROVED CAR SEAT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: A STORY ABOUT PALIN GETTING OUT OF THE CAR AND BEATING A WOMAN WITH A TIRE IRON. WHY ARE YOU WASTING OUR TIME. AS THE DAY WORE ON AND THE READING DAY LABOURERS CAME BACK EMPTY-HANDED, THE  DESPERATION BEGAN TO SHOW.
ARE YOU SEEING ANY INDICATION OF THAT, WHERE YOU KNOW, MIGHT BE SOME, SHE  TAKE SOME SHOTS AT THE MEDIA DOESN'T APPRECIATE HOW SHE IS BEING COVERED, ANYTHING  LIKE THAT AND REMEMBER TROOPER GAIT AND ALSO THE ETHICS VIOLATIONS, ANY OF  THAT STUFF WE KNOW ABOUT HER, ARE YOU FINDING ANY INDICATION OF?
COME ON, BABY, COME ON! OF LAUGH.
GIVE ME A LITTLE SOMETHING OF THAT, BABY. DADDY'S GOT TO HAVE SOME JUICE.
BUT FOR ALL THE TIME THEY SPENT ON IT, NO EXCHANGE, BETTER SUMMED UP THE DAY THAT CABLE NEWS SPENT READING SARAH PALIN'S OLD  E-MAILS THAN THIS ONE.
DREW, IS THIS TRIVIAL STUFF OR MONUMENTAL OR SOMETHING IN BETWEEN?
(LAUGHTER)
THAT, FIRST OF ALL, THAT WASN'T EVEN A QUESTION IT WAS LIKE SOME BIZARRE  EXISTENTIAL RIDDLE. LET ME ASK YOU, IS IT SOMETHING OR NOTHING? OR SOMETHING IN BETWEEN NOTHING AND SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW. HELP ME.
THE EXERCISE WASN'T AN ENTIRE LOSS. SOME REPORTERS DID MANAGE TO DIGEST AND SOLIDIFY THE NEWS MEDIA A PERFORMANCE.
THIS IS A MASSIVE DUMP.
MAMA GRIZZLY SIZED DUMP, IT IS SO HUGE.
WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL CHUNK.
SO FAR NO ONE HAS REALLY FOUND A HUGE EXPLOSIVE NUGGET IN THERE.
RIGHT.
BASICALLY THE MEDIA ADMITTING THEY TOOK A MASSIVE DUMP AND FOUND NO NUGGETS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BUT KEEP SIFTING THROUGH IT. I'M SURE THERE'S A PONY IN THERE SOMEWHERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CH
