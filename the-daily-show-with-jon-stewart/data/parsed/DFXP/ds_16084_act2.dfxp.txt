SHOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR THE PAST I'M GOING TO SAY LIKE 12, 13 YEARS, FOX NEWS AND I HAVE BEEN HAVING KIND OF A  FUN, LIGHT-HEARTED AND I THINK EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHICH ONE OF  US IS THE BIGGER ASSHOLE. THEY, PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY, BELIEVE IT IS ME. WHEREAS I HAVE TAKE AN DIFFERENT APPROACH AND TEND TO LEAN TOWARDS THE IDEA IT IS PERHAPS THEM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NO, NO, NO. AS OF NOW WE HAVE AGREED TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. BUT OVER THE PAST FOUR DAYS I BELIEVE FOX HAS BEGUN WHAT APPEARS TO BE THEIR CLOSING ARGUMENTS.
JON STEWART SAYS HE'S BOTH LIBERAL AND FAIR. IS HE REALLY IN
DID JON STEWART MOCK REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HERMAN CANE BECAUSE  HE'S A BLACK MAN?
A CLOSER LOOK AT WHY THE COMEDIAN GETS AWAY AT HIS ONE-SIDED ATTACKS.
JON STEWART NEEDS A LESSON ON TRUTH-TELLING.
WHY IS JON STEWART IN DENIAL ABOUT HIS LIBERAL LEANINGS?
HERMAN CAIN SAYS COMEDIAN JON STEWART WAS MOCKING HIM.
HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF JON STEWART'S BIAS.
JON STEWART GETS HIS VIEW FROM THE LEFT BUT CAN'T ADMIT  HE'S A LIBERAL MOUTHPIECE.
HERMAN CAIN ON HIS FEUD WITH POLITICAL SEQUESTER JON STEWART.
JON STEWART BREAKS INTO HIS AMOS AND ANDY ROUTINE TO MOCK HERMAN CAIN.
JON STEWART TRIES TO DISGUISE HIS TRUE LIBERAL BIAS.
JON STEWART SAYS HE'S BOTH LIBERAL AND HE'S FAIR. LET'S SEE HOW THAT'S WORKING OUT.
Jon: I GUESS EVERYONE GOT THE MEMO. [LAUGHTER] DO YOU WANT TO BRING YOUR WHOLE NETWORK TO THE THROWDOWN? YOU WANT TO GO CHANNEL 44 VERSUS CHANNEL 45? OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THE CHANNEL CONFIGURATION OF TIME WARNER IN THE NEW YORK AREA, YOUR LOCAL  LISTINGS WHERE COMEDY CENTRAL AND FOX ARE WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE. OF COURSE, HD IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SITUATION. MY POINT IS YOU DON'T THINK I HAVE PEEPS? YOU DON'T THINK I ROLL DEEP? CC ROLLS DEEP, YO, YO, CHECK THIS [BLEEPED] OUT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. COMEDY CENTRAL, GET ME KRUD MANDOON. THAT'S, MOTHER... REALLY? CANCELED? WHEN WAS THAT CANCELED? HE'S OUR ONLY GUY WITH A SWORD, THOUGH? HOW AM I GOING TO... THAT SHOW WAS LIKE OUR "GAME OF THRONES." IT WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME. ALL RIGHT, FINE. I'LL HANDLE IT MYSELF. EVERYBODY AT FOX IS REAL MAD ABOUT THIS HERMAN CAIN JOKE. CANDIDATE HERMAN CAIN OFFERS REAL SOLUTIONS TO FICTIONAL ISSUES.
DON'T TRY TO PASS A 2,700 PAGE BILL. YOU AND I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO READ IT. WE'RE TOO BUSY TRYING TO LIVE, SEND OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL. THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO ONLY ALLOW SMALL BILLS, THREE PAGES. YOU'D HAVE TIME TO READ THAT ONE OVER THE DINNER TABLE.
Jon: BILLS WILL BE THREE PAGES. IF I AM PRESIDENT, TREATIES WILL HAVE TO FIT ON THE BACK OF A CEREAL BOX. FROM NOW ON THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS WILL BE DELIVERED IN THE FORM OF A FORTUNE COOKIE. I AM HERMAN CAIN, AND I DO NOT LIKE TO READ. NOW, THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OFFENSIVE JOKE. THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS OFFENSIVE AMOS AND ANDY BROGUE AND THEIR NEWS GUYS WOULD BE FIRED IF THEY  DID A VOICE LIKE THAT, ALTHOUGH, I DID GET INTO THAT STORY USING A WHEEL WITH A DILDO NAILED IT TO, WHICH I WOULD IMAGINE WOULD  LIKELY GET THEM FIRED, AS WELL. [LAUGHTER] I JUST DON'T SEE THEM USING A DILDO WHEEL. THE POINT IS THIS: THEY FELT I WAS SINGLING OUT HERMAN CAIN USING OFFENSIVE VOICE, NOT  BECAUSE I ALWAYS USE THEM, AND I THOUGHT THE THREE-PAGE BILL IDEA WAS SILLY, BUT BECAUSE THEY  SUGGESTED BECAUSE HERMAN CAIN IS BLACK AND MORE IMPORTANTLY CONSERVATIVE. WELL, IF MY RIDICULE OF SILLY THINGS USING BIZARRE CARICATURE VOICES HAS GIVEN FOX WHAT  APPEARS TO BE SEVERAL DAYS OF VERY STRONG PROGRAMING --  [LAUGHTER] YOUR CUP ABOUT TO RUNNETH OVER, MOTHER [BLEEPED]. GRAB A KNIFE AND FORK, FOX. BECAUSE I HAVE TURNED MY CRACK RESEARCH TEAM ON MYSELF. AND IN A BRAND-NEW SETTINGMENT CALLED... [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO RUN THESE TITLES BY ME? ALL RIGHT. WELL, ANYWAY, PREPARE FOR TOMORROW'S HUFFINGTON POST HEADLINE "STEWART EVOICE RATES  STEWART." ROLL.
ON THE EIGHTH DAY, THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS ONLY ENOUGH HOPE FOR THREE DAYS.
YOU INVITE AN IMPORTANT VISITOR TO OUR HOUSE AND OUR TONE AND EAT YOUR PIZZA WITH A  [BLEEPED] FORK RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.
I WANT TO BLESS THE CHILDREN. YOU WILL NOT WE NIGH GOD'S LOVE.
THE GIANT [BLEEPED] GAGGOONS HANGING ON THIS MAN.
I'M SO SHORT. CAN YOU LEAN OVER.
[INAUDIBLE]
ANTHONY, GO INSIDE, AND IF YOU COME BACK OUT, WEAR A LIGHT JACKET.
ALL RIGHT, BOYS. YOU KNOW THE RULES. I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING. [SPEAKING IN ALL DIFFERENT ACCENTS]
I LIKE TO EAT CHEESE.
WHAT?
YOU CAN TAKE OUR HORSES, BUT YOU'LL NEVER TAKE OURRATION!
GUVNAH.
NEW YORK I'M NO SPY, JUST  [BLEEPED] WITH SUMMER HOME.
WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING EZ PASS.
YOU CAN'T GET THERE FROM QUEE-EH.
HE WASN'T GOING OUT WITH LITTLE BOYS.
YOU SHOULD SEE SOME OF THE  [BLEEPED] I'VE DONE.
BETTER ON THE FLOOR THAN IN THE SENATE.
KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.
ANOTHER TO BE CERTAIN THAN RIGHT.
AM I RIGHT, LADIES.
YOU TWO KISS WHILE I WATCH.
WE'RE COOL AGAIN, RIGHT?
I'M REAL HUNGRY.
RULES ARE RULES.
WHAT? WHAT, WHAT?
I TOLD YOU I NEEDED THE DRIVEWAY CLEAN.
COME ON, BABY. WHY DON'T YOU LET DR. O COVER ALL YOUR PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, BABY?
I AM AMERICA.
DAMN, AMERICA, HAVE YOU LOST WEIGHT?
SOME OF THE SAVINGS WILL COME THROUGH LESS WASTE AND MORE EFFICIENCY.
FROM NOW ON WHEN WE BUY OFFICE SUPPLIES, WE WILL JOIN UP WITH CANADA AND MEXICO TO LOOK  FOR DEALS ON GROUPON.
TONIGHT WE CELEBRATE.
WEDNESDAY WE GO SHOPPING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
