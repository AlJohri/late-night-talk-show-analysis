Jon: WELCOME BACK. BIG WEEK, BIG, BIG WEEK. A BIG WEEK FOR ONE NEWTON LEROY GINGRICH TAKING HIS VICTORY TO SOUTH CAROLINA  PRIMARY AND BROUGHT THAT NEWT-MENTUM DOWN TO FLORIDA.
RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO CANDIDATE IN THIS STATE HOTTER THAN GINGRICH.
OH MY GOSH.
Jon: I'M TELLING YOU MAN, I KNOW THAT UNDER SO, HERE COME THE GRAHNIE PANTIES. NOW GINGRICH DOES HAVE MOMENTUM BUT THERE ARE STILL CONCERNS ABOUT VOTERS THAT  GINGRICH NEEDS TO ADDRESS.
YOU KNOW, I WAS ATTACKED THE OTHER NIGHT FOR BEING GRANDIOS.
Jon: CAN'T A GUY DOODLE HIS HEAD ON MT. RUSHMORE WITHOUT TAKING HEAT FROM THE  LAMESTREAM EVERY ONE, ACTUALLY NEWT SAY PRETTY SHREWD POLITICIAN. I'M SURE WILL TAKE STEPS TO BLUNT THAT LINE OF ATTACK.
I'M GOING GIVE A SET OF GOALS AND THEN I WILL MAKE A SET OF OBSERVATIONS ABOUT  HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHY, WHY LIMIT YOURSELF TO TWO. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M SURE IT'S MORE MODEST AND HUMBLE THAN IT SOUNDS. PROBABLY GOING TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HIS SECOND TERM, HAVE SOME BUDGETARY SCHRIDGING, SOLID, ACHIEVABLE CONSERVATIVE ASPIRATION.
BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM-- WE WILL HAVE THE FIRST PERMANENT BATES ON THE  MOON AND IT WILL BE AMERICAN. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: A MOON BASE? YOUR SOLUTION TO BEING ACCUSED OF GROONSDITY IS GIVE ME EIGHT YEARS AND I HAVE HAVE A [BLEEP] MOON BASE. DID YOU START WITH DEATHSTAR AND GOT KIND OF REIGNED IN? BY THE WAY MR. MOON BASE BASE-- MR. MOONBASE WHAT WAS YOUR PROBLEM WITH RON PAUL AGAIN?
YOU LOOK AT RON PAUL'S TOTAL RECORD OF SYSTEMIC AVOIDANCE OF REALITY, THERE  WILL COME A MORNING PEOPLE WON'T TAKE HIM AS A SERIOUS PERSON.
Jon: YEAH, NO, THEY WON'T, YOU'RE RIGHT, THEY WON'T. YOU'RE RIGHT, MR. MOONBASE THEY WON'T TAKE RON PAUL SERIOUSLY. AND THAT'S WHY I'M GOING MAKE RON PAUL MY FIRST AMBASSADOR TO MOONLANDIA. HE'S OUT THERE. SO WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS MOON BASS?
WHEN WE HAVE 13,000 AMERICANS LIVING ON THE MOON THEY CAN COMPETITION TO BECOME A STATE.
Jon: 13,000, THAT'S NOT A STATE, THAT'S LIKE A CONDO DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S NOT A STATE. YOU WANT TO BE A CONDO DEVELOPER ON THE MOON. YOU WANT TO BE LIKE A LUNAR TRUMP. AND MAY I SAY THIS, LIKE EARTH TRUMP, YOU WILL NOT SHALL PRESIDENT. HERE'S THE INTERESTING THING--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: AS IF THERE IS ANYTHING NOT INTERESTING ABOUT NEWT GINGRICH'S  MOONBASE, SO IN 1993 WHEN DEMOCRATS FLOATED THE IDEA OF STATE HOUT FOR WASHINGTON, D.C. WITH  500,000, OR LIKE 40 MOON COLE ONEE. NEWT GINGRICH SAID THE WHOLE IDEA WAS CRAZY.
OF THOSE PEOPLE IN D.C. UNHINGED. NOBODY WILL TAKE AN IDEA LIKE THAT SERIOUSLY UNLESS YOU MOVE IT TO THE MOON. I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT MAKING NEW STATES. NEWT GINGRICH DID THAT GLOBAL WARMING AD WITH NANCY PELOSI REALIZED THAT THE  EARTH IS VERY SICK, AND NOW HE WANTS TO LEAVE IT FOR A YOUNGER PLANET. WE'LL BE RIGHT B
