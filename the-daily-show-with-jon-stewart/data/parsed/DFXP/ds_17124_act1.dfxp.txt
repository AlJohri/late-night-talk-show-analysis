Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, NEW YORK GIANTS WIDE RECEIVER VICTOR CRUZ. CRUISE-SANITY WHETHER... YEAH, IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK, DOES IT? (LAUGHTER) I'M JUST GRASPING AT STRAWS. THAT'S ACTUALLY STEVE MARTIN, THAT'S NOT REALLY... (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WEST VIRGINIA. I THINK HE JUST LABELED IT EGYPT. THANK YOU. THAT'S... AS YOU KNOW, EGYPT HAS RECENTLY HELD ITS FIRST FREE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE... (LAUGHTER) ... THE INVENTION OF LANG LANGUAGE. (LAUGHTER) THE WINNER, THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD'S MOHAMMED MORSESY. THAT'S MORRISSEY. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S MORRIS IS CAT. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S CONRAD BANE AND YOU'VE JUST LABELED HIM MODE MED MORSI. THANK YOU. SO ANYWAY, OUR INTREPID SECRETARY OF STATE SIR EDMUND HILLARY DENNIS ROM HAM CLINTON  WENT TO PAY HER ROPTS TO THEIR NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT AND...
ON SUNDAY SECRETARY CLINTON'S MOTORCADE WAS PELTED WITH  TOMATOES AND SHOES AS SHE LEFT THE NEWLY REOPENED U.S. CONSULATE. (LAUGHTER) WHAT? WHAT IS GOING ON, EGYPT? YOU'RE MAD AT US WHEN WE PROP UP YOUR DICTATOR FOR 30 YEARS AND  NOW YOU'RE MAD AT US WHEN WE GO VISIT THE GUY YOU VOTED FOR? I MEAN, WHAT! (LAUGHTER) YOU SUPPLY ONE COUNTRY'S MILITARY WITH TEAR GAS CANISTERS  THAT THEY USE ON THEIR OWN POPULOUS AND THEY NEVER STOP CRYING ABOUT IT. (LAUGHTER) MAINLY BECAUSE THEIR TEAR DUCTS ARE DAMAGED. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, I KNOW THAT YOU THERE IN EGYPT ARE NEW TO THE  WHOLE PUBLIC PROTEST THING THERE YOU KNOW, BUT THE LITERAL THROWING OF TOMATOES IS... (LAUGHTER) IT'S A BIT OF A CLICHE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? PEOPLE IN THE POST-VAUDEVILLEIAN ERA DON'T ACTUALLY THROW TOMATOES. UNLESS YOU'RE THROWING THEM AT BUGS BUNNY. IF YOU INSIST ON THROWING FOOD, WHY NOT BRING A BIT OF YOUR OWN CULTURE FARE. LOOK AT THE GREEKS. WHEN THEY'RE UPSET THEY THROW... (LAUGHTER) WHEN THEY'RE UPSET THEY THROW BUCKETS OF THEIR COUNTRY'S  SIGNATURE BACTERIALLY FERMENTED MILK, YOGURT. IT'S PROTEST STATEMENT AND AN EXPRESSION OF NATIONAL PRIDE. YOU COULD THROW YOUR SHAWARMA. YOUR A TEENY. YOUR BABA GHANOUSH. REALLY ANY OF THE FOODS THAT CAME UP WHEN WE SEARCHED EGYPTIAN CUISINE. ON WIKIPEDIA. (LAUGHTER) LOOK, EGYPT. INSULTING HIGH-RANKING U.S. OFFICIALS ISN'T GOING TO GET THEM TO CHANGE THEIR POLICY. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING AMERICA'S POWERFUL LEADERS RESPOND TO.
THE OBAMAS CAUGHT ON KISSCAM DURING THE BASKETBALL GAME VERSUS BRAZIL. MICHELLE OBAMA LOOKED SHOCKED AND SHE SMILED AND WAVED. THE DISAPPOINTED CROWD BOOED. THEY GOT A SECOND CHANCE WHEN THE KISSCAM FOUND THEM AGAIN SO THIS TIME HE DELIVERED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE KISSCAM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE ONLY THING THE MOST POWERFUL LEADERS IN THE WORLD BEND TO. THAT'S ONE MORE REASON TO BE THANKFUL AL GORE WAS NEVER PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER) SURE OUR COUNTRY MIGHT NEVER HAVE INVADED IRAQ, THE EARTH'S  TEMPERATURE WOULD BE MAYBE A FEW DEGREES COOLER BUT NOT WORTH IT. (LAUGHTER) AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SUSCEPTIBLE TO CERTAIN KINDS OF PRESSURE. HAVE YOU HEARD THE FULL AUDIO OF REAGAN'S BERLIN WALL SPEECH? (AS RONALD REAGAN) I REALIZE REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ON THE VALUE OF THIS. WHAT'S THAT? DID YOU JUST SNEEZE AND SAY "PUSS ZI?" MR. GORBACHEV, TEAR DOWN THIS WALL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT IS AN EXACT AUDIO RECORDING. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS NEED PEER PRESSURE, SOMETIMES YOU CAN  BEND AMERICANS TO YOUR WILL WITH BRUTE FORCE AS WHAT HAPPENED TO AN ICON IN LONDON.
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, PAUL McCARTNEY. OVER THE WEEKEND THEY THRILLED FANS AT A CONCERT IN LONDON. THAT IS UNTIL ORGANIZERS PULLED THE PLUG (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: YOU (BLEEP)ED WITH THE WRONG DUDE. (LAUGHTER) THEY CUT SPRINGSTEEN'S MIC THREE HOURS INTO THE SHOW? THAT'S HALF TIME! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?
APPARENTLY THE FOLKS WHO LIVE HERE IN THE AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOOD SURROUNDING HYDE  PARK WHO HAVE DEMANDED A NOISE CURFEW AND THIS CONCERT HAD GONE PAST THE TIME LIMIT PROMPTING  SOMEONE TO SHUT THEM DOWN.
Jon: OH, IT WAS ANGRY OLD RICH PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) CAME OUT OF THEIR HOUSES AND WENT "YOU KIDS! TURN DOWN THAT!" OH, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE 70. I DIDN'T REALIZE. (LAUGHTER) LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, ENGLAND, NOBODY PUTS BRUCEY IN A CORNER! SPRINGSTEEN GETS TO SING AS LONG AS HE WANTS AS LOUD AS HE WANTS  AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE CAN DO... CAN DO... BE WHAT'S THIS?
BE QUIET, JON! BE QUIET! KEEP IT DOWN.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IT'S NIGHT, JON. BRITAIN HAS GOT THE OLYMPICS COMING UP. WE NEED OUR REST! NEXT WE LOSE EITHER THE TWO BRONZE MEDALS WE'RE HOPING FOR. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHICH EVENT DO YOU GET THE BRONZE IN?
WHICH EVENTS? JAVELIN AND SYNCHRONIZED SINKING.
Jon: SWIMMING. SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING.
REALLY. (BLEEP) THERE GOES ONE BRONZE. LOOK, YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD. CUT HIS MIC. CUT HIS MIC NOW.
Jon: DON'T YOU DARE!
CUT IT! YOU BE QUIET NOW. YOU BE QUIET! NO, BE QUIET! YOU'VE BEEN TOO NOISY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NO, NO, NO.
Jon: THIS IS AMERICA.
NO, NO, NO.
Jon: WE DON'T LET BRITISH PEOPLE TELL US HOW LOUD WE CAN BE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) A LITTLE BIT BREEZYN'T N HERE, ISN'T IT, OLIVER? WHO THE HELL DO YOU PEOPLE THINK YOU ARE CUTTING OFFSPRING AND SEEN THE'S MIC? HE'S THE BOSS.
OH, YEAH, WELL, WE HAVE THE QUEEN, JON. THE ACTUAL QUEEN. AND YOU DO NOT KEEP HER UP PAST HER BEDTIME.
Jon: OH (BLEEP)
LET ME TELL YOU... (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) IT'S GETTING REAL NOW. JON, LET ME TELL YOU....
Jon: ♪ ♪ (SINGING)
IF SHE DOESN'T GET 15 HOURS UNINTERRUPTED SLEEP SHE'S A (BLEEP)ING MONSTER! SO YOU KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!
Jon: ♪ COME TAKE MY HANDS ♪
KEEP IT DOWN!
Jon: IF THE QUEEN EVER COMES TO NEW JERSEY, BUDDY...
OH, JON, THE QUEEN IS NEVER COMING TO NEW JERSEY. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHY NOT?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY. I'LL TELL YOU WHY, JON, BECAUSE THE QUEEN IS A LADY WHO HAS NO BUSINESS ASSOCIATING HERSELF  WITH HUMAN FILTH. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: I HEAR OTHERWISE. LISTEN, IF SHE DID, WE'D NEVER TURN HER T MIC OFF. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THIS IS AMERICA. WE'RE ABOUT FREEDOM. ONE NATION INDWIZABLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. AND THAT FREEDOM...
OH, THAT'S NICE, JON. FREEDOM? FREEDOM, REMIND ME, WHAT SOLDIERS ARE YOU ALLOWED? (APPLAUSE)
Jon: (BLEEP)
QUIET! JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY.
