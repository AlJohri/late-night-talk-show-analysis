WELCOME BACK. OH, THE SUMMER OLYMPICS OUT IN FULL SWING, THRILLING SPORTS FANS. AND PEOPLE WHO BECOME SPORTS FANS EVERY FOUR YEARS OR SO. BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM. THE GAMES OF COURSE ARE TAKING PLACE IN LONDON, FIVE HOURS AHEAD OF EAST COAST  WHICH IS REALLY-- ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) IN TODAY'S HYPERCONNECTED WORLD, NOTHING STAYS SECRET FOR HALF A DAY. SO THE RESULTS ARE OUT THERE BUT NBC PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO AIR THE GAMES. LUCKILY THE NEWS CHANNELS ARE WATCHING OUT FOR YOU.
THE SIGH LENDERS AGAIN, SIRENS EQUAL SPOILERS ALERT, WE ARE GETTING NEW RESULTS IN FROM THIS AFTERNOON'S OLYMPIC EVENTS SO IF YOU DO  NOT WANT TO HEAR THE RESULTS NOW-- .
Jon: PEOPLE WATCH CNN NOT ON MUTE? (LAUGHTER) HUH. I MEAN-- WHY DON'T YOU JUST MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT HOW PEOPLE REALLY WATCH CNN. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THE RESULTS PLEASE LOOK DOWN AT YOUR TREADMILL. (LAUGHTER) OR BOARD YOUR PLANE. THIS IS CNN. BUT ACTUALLY THESE SPOILER ALERTS SHOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. LET'S SEE HOW THEY WORK. OKAY, LET ME GET THIS THING. I WILL DO A LITTLE CHANNEL SURFING HERE. GO.
FIRST WE WANT TO WARN YOU, SPOILER ALERT, MAJOR SPOILER OUT OF LONDON.
JUST LOOKING AT IT HERE.
SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE RESULTS OF MENS 400 INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY NOW SAY  GOOD TIME TO MUTE THE TV BUT JUST OR TURN AWAY JUST FOR A MOMENT.
MUTE, OKAY THEY GO AND MUTE TV IS MUTE AND--  (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)  WHY IS RYAN LOCHTE WINKING AT ME? I GUESS I'LL FIND OUT TONIGHT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY IT AGAIN, LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE GOT THERE.
SO I WILL GET IN THE WATER AND RACE AS HARD AS I CAN. IF A RECORD HAPPEN, IT HAPPENS.
AND SPOILER ALERT, WE SHOULD TELL YOU PHELPS JUST WON.
WHAT THE [BLEEP] NO! SPOILARY ALL RIGHT PHELPS JUST WON IS NOT ONE WORD. IT'S SPOILER ALERT. ARE YOU READY? I JUST HAD ENOUGH TO GO-- HUH? EVEN NBC WHO HAD THE GAMES HAS THE OCCASIONAL MISSTEP. ON MONDAY I AVOIDED THE GAMES BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE THE 17-YEAR-OLD MISSY  FRANKLIN WHO WAS GOING WIN HER FIRST GOLD MEDAL IN SWIMMING. SO FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE RACE THIS AIRED.
COMING UP, HOW GOOD CAN MISSY FRANKLIN BE TONIGHT. FINALS COMING UP.
WHEN YOU'RE 17 YEARS OLD AND WIN YOUR FIRST GOLD MEDAL, THERE'S NOBODY YOU  WOULD RATHER SHARE IT WITH. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU'RE KILLING ME WITH THIS STUFF! SO YOU KNOW, THE TAPE DELAY ALWAYS HELPS. SOLIS EN, NBC IS IN A TOUGH SPOT. AND THE GUY WITH THE MOST THANKLESS JOB IS YOUR BRIAN WILLIAMS IT THIS GUY IS THE LEAD ANCHOR. HE HAS TO SERVE THE DEMANDS OF REPORTING THE NEWS, WITH THE GRAPHI TAS BUT ALSO  PROTECTING THE NETWORK. THAT HAS SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE IDEA THAT ITS VIEWERS WON'T KNOW THE NEWS. SO THIS IS A NEWS VAULT WITH A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THE RESULTS, CLOSE YOUR EYES OR LOOK AWAY FOR A MOMENT. LOCHTE AND PHELPS, LATE TODAY, THEY COMPETED TOGETHER IN THE MENS 4 X 100 FREESTYLE RELAY AND THE  RESULTS ARE ON YOUR SCREEN.
Jon: THAT TOTALLY WORKED BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS TALKING IT SOUNDED VERY INFORMATIVE  YET I HAVE NO [BLEEP] IDEA WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. I DON'T KNOW ITEM NEWS HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN REPORTED THIS WAY. (LAUGHTER) HITLER IS ON THE MARCH. WILL YOUR COUNTRY SOON BE QUAKING UNDER THE 100'S IRON HEEL? LOOK AWAY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHICH COUNTRY HE'S INVADING!
