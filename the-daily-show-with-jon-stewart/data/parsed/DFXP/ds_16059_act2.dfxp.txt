Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. REMEMBER LAST WEEK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES RELEASED HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND YOU  THOUGHT, FINALLY WE WILL HAVE A REST PERIOD FOR THOSE CLAMORING TO SEE DOCUMENTATION OF AN EVENT  MOST ARE ALREADY COMFORTABLE OCCURRED. AND THEN WE KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN. [LAUGHTER] I HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR RESPITE.
I THINK WE HAVE TO RELEASE THE PHOTOS.
THE PHOTOS HAVE TO BE RELEASED.
THEY NEED TO RELEASE THESE TWO PHOTOS SIMULTANEOUSLY.
I SAY RELEASE THE PHOTO, MR. PRESIDENT.
Jon: WE MUST BECAUSE A PHOTO WILL END THE SPECULATION. JUST LIKE THE ZAPRUDER FILM PUT A REST TO ALL THAT J.F.K. BUSINESS. [LAUGHTER] PEOPLE SAW THAT AND WENT, I'M SATISFIED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M ALL FOR HEALTHY SCEPTICISM, AND EVEN THOUGH BIN LADEN'S WIDOW  POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED THE BODY TO PAKISTANI AUTHORITIES, WHY WOULDN'T WE RELEASE THE HEAD  SHOT OF BIN LADEN'S HEAD SHOT?
PEOPLE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION WHO HAVE SEEN THE IMAGES DESCRIBE THEM AS  GRUESOME, AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT.
I'VE HAD IT DESCRIBED TO ME, AND IT DOES SOUND VERY GRUESOME.
THE PICTURE IS VERY GORY. HE HAS A GAPING WOUND ABOVE HIS LEFT EYE. THERE'S BLOOD. THERE'S BRAIN TISSUE.
Jon: UH-HUH. TOO GORY? TOO GORY? HAVE YOU MET US? [LAUGHTER] FROM 8:00 P.M. ON, EVERY SHOW ON TELEVISION WE WATCH BEGINS WITH AN INTERNAL TRACKING SHOT OF A  GAPING WOUND ABOVE SOMEONE'S LEFT EYE PULLING OUT ONLY TO REVEAL HALF A HOOKER IN A  DUMPSTER DISCOVERED BY A CHILD ON A BICYCLE. YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL IT? "PRIME TIME." YOU KNOW WHAT, LET US HELP WITH THE AUTOPSY. [APPLAUSE] LET US HELP WITH THE AUTOPSY. SHOW US THE PICTURE. WE WON'T BE DISGUSTED. YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HEAR FROM US. YOU COULD TELL FROM THE SUBCUTANEOUS HEMORRHAGING THAT THE SHOT WAS FIRED. THE EXIT WOUND SUGGESTS AN AR-19 ASSAULT RIFLE. I LEARNED THAT ON "BONES." THAT'S RIGHT. LOOKS LIKE THE LEADER OF AL QAEDA IS AL QAEDEAD. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] OH, OH, DAVID CARUSO, IS THERE NOTHING YOUR SUNGLASSES CAN'T FIX? [LAUGHTER] COME ON, MAN, WE CAN TAKE THE GORE. ANY OTHER REASON WE CAN'T SEE THE PICTURES?
IT'S TRICKY BECAUSE YOU CAN INFLAME PEOPLE.
WILL THE RELEASE OF WIN BIN LADEN'S PROOF OF DEATH PHOTOS  PROVOKE A RETALIATORY ATTACK.
IF YOU PUT IT OUT THERE, IT MAY INFLAME THE MUSLIM WORLD.
Jon: THE EXTREMISTS OVER THERE ALREADY HATE US, AND I  DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW, THIS THE MUSLIM WORLD SEES PRETTY GRAPHIC IMAGES OF PEOPLE WE KILL ON  PURPOSE OR ACCIDENTALLY ALL THE TIME. JARRING, HUH? SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SEE IT ON TV, JUST OUT THE WINDOW. YOU KNOW, THE TRAGIC COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF WAR IS THE SUBJECT OF AL-JAZEERA'S ENTIRE 6:00 A.M. SHOW "MOURNING JOE."  [LAUGHTER] BUT I WILL SAY THIS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RELEASE THE IMAGE TO THE  PUBLIC, THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO QUELL ANY "HE'S NOT DEAD" RUMORS. INVITE A BUNCH OF JOURNALISTS TO VIEW THE PICTURES IN PRIVATE. WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, TURN IT INTO A HAWPGHTSED HOUSE. LET REPORTERS FEEL OSAMA'S BRAINS AND EYEBALLS. OH, MAN, ARE THOSE JELLYBEANS OR... PERSONALLY THE BEST REASON IN MY MIND FOR RELEASING THE  PICTURES IS WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THIS WAR FOR NEARLY TEN YEARS. THOUSANDS OF U.S. DEATHS, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF IRAQIS AND AFGHANIS HAVE DIED, AND WE'VE  SEEN NEARLY ZERO PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF IT. REMEMBER HOW LONG THE MEDIA HAD TO FIGHT TO SHOW MILITARY COFFINS RETURNING FROM OVERSEAS? YOU PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER BECAUSE YOU SAW PICTURES OF IT THE DAY THEY WON THE CASE AND  NOT SINCE. MAYBE WE SHOULD ALWAYS SHOW PICTURES -- BIN LADEN, WOUNDED SERVICE PEOPLE, MAIMED, INNOCENT CIVILIANS. WE CAN ONLY MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WAR IF WE SEE WHAT WAR ACTUALLY IS AND NOT AS A VIDEO GAME WHERE  BODIES QUICKLY DISAPPEAR, LEAVING BEHIND A SHINY, GOLD COIN. WHICH FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS GOING UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED TODAY IT OFFICIALLY DECIDED TO NOT RELEASE THE BIN  LADEN PHOTO. INSTEAD TO KEEP IT A SECRET THEY'RE GOING TO AIR DROP IT INTO AN AFTER FLIEWNTS PAKISTANI  SUBURB SO IT WON'T BE FOUND FOR YEARS. WE'LL
