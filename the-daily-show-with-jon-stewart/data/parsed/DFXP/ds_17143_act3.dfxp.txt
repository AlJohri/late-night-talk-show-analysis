WELCOME BACK. TONIGHT, A UNITED STATES SENATOR, REPRESENTING THIS GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, SENATOR MARCO RUBIO!
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU. WELCOME TO FLORIDA.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SO KIND TO US, MANY OF THEM SAYING WHEN YOU  LEAVE HERE, TAKE US WITH YOU. YOU KNOW, THAT SORT OF THING.
YEAH.
Jon: IT HAS BEEN GREAT. WE HAVE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME IN THE HOSPITAL, AND THE HOSPITALITY HAS BEEN GREAT AND  THANKS TO YOU AND THANKS TO THE STATE FOR WELCOMING US. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: NOW THIS IS JUST ME AND YOU TALKING. SO MITT ROMNEY ASKS PAUL RYAN.
YEAH.
Jon: AND YOUR NAME WAS THROWN OUT THERE. YOU, MY FRIEND, YOU DONALD IT.
YOU DODGED IT. BECAUSE LET'S SAY HE WINS. AS HIS VICE PRESIDENT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU TO RUN AGAINST HIM IN 2016. SO --
I THINK THIS IS MUCH BETTER FOR YOU. HOW DID THAT -- DID THEY CALL TO TELL YOU?  HOW DID THEY DO IT?  HOW DID THEY BREAK THAT NEWS.
I TALKED TO THEM. AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT IT IS NEXT DAY.
Jon: HE PERSONALLY CALLED YOU.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU CURSED AT THEM?
NO, NO, I DIDN'T.
Jon: PAWLENTY, HAD HIS SON CALL, HE DID NOT CALL THEM AND ONE OF THEM, I THINK, WAS  NOTIFIED BY A STRIP O GRAM.
I READ THAT IN THE PAPER.
Jon: HAS HE WON YOU OVER?  HAS HE -- I STIPULATE THE BASE OF THE PARTY HAS NOT WARMED UP  TO HIM. HOW HAS HE WON YOU?
WELL --
Jon: HOW HAS HE NOT WON YOU?
NO, NO. FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW GOVERNOR ROMNEY, I HAVE KNOWN HIM SINCE 2007.
Jon: YET YOU STILL HAVE TO CALL HIM GOVERNOR ROMNEY, THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.
IT IS A RESPECTFUL THING.
Jon:.
NOW, LOOK I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW HIM PERSONALLY, AS A PERSON. I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH HIM ON THE POLICIES BUT IF YOU GET TO KNOW  HIM AS A PERSON, AS A FATHER, AS A LEADER IN HIS COMMUNITY I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO ADMIRE  THERE AND THERE IS A LOT I LIKE ABOUT HIM AND I JUST THINK THE DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT FROM WHEN  HE RAN IN '08, THIS IS A MUCH BETTER CANDIDATE NOW.
Jon: HOW DID HE GET BETTER. BECAUSE HE WAS VERY WOODEN AND NOW HE IS -- NO. NOW HE IS NOT WOODEN. HE IS MORE CLAY LIKE. AND I THINK THAT IS AN IMPROVEMENT OF SUBSTANCE.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
Jon:.
HE IS GREAT. I THINK HE REALLY CONNECTS WITH PEOPLE. AND THE TIMES HE HAS BEEN WITH ME, I MEAN HE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF GOING OUT ON THE STUMP  AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE BELIEVES IN AND SEE PEOPLE GET EXCITED ABOUT IT AND I THINK HE  WILL GIVE A GREAT SPEECH ON THURSDAY. I DO.
Jon: NOW YOU WERE INTRODUCING --
I AM.
Jon: HIM.
I AM.
Jon: HAVE THEY SAID TO YOU, HEY, CHARISMA BOY -- TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH?
THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME. THE ONLY THING THEY ASKED ME TO DO IS INTRODUCE THE GOVERNOR AND AGAIN ME 15 MINUTES TO SAY  WHATEVER I WANT.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WILL GO WITH?  HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT?
I HAVE GOT SOME STUFF I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING ON THESE THINGS, BOTH PARTIES ARE SO WELL COORDINATED, AND DID  THEY SPEAK TO YOU AT ALL HERE IS A THEME. LIKE WHAT IS IS A THEME THAT IS CLOSE TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO?
THE THEME OF THE NIGHT IS AMERICA'S EXCEPTIONALISM, GREAT  AMERICA, WE BELIEVE IN AMERICA AND THAT IS THE THEME OF THE NIGHT.
Jon: THEY FEEL LIKE THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PUSHBACK ON THAT?  IT SEEMS LIKE ONE OF  THOSE THINGS, MOST PEOPLE ARE LIKE YEAH, I WILL GO WITH THAT.
WHO WOULD BE AGAINST HOPE AND CHANGE?
Jon: EXACTLY.
BUT LET'S SHOW YOU WHAT THE CHANGE IS.
Jon: NOW THAT IS AN INTERESTING -- I GUESS THE REAL DIFFERENCE IS, HE IS SAYING  PRIVATE ENTER SURPRISE THE WAY TO GO WHERE THEY THINK OBAMA IS SAYING GOVERNMENT ENTER BREEZE  IS THE WAY TO GO. IS THAT THE REAL DIFFERENCE.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE ROLE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PLAY IN THE ECONOMY. HAVING THE PRESIDENT AS A BELIEVER AND MANY IN HIS PARTY ARE THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S  POLICIES CAN SPUR THAT ON, SPECIAL SPENDING PROGRAM OF SOME SORT. I FOR EXAMPLE, MOST PEOPLE IN MY PARTY BELIEVE WHAT GOVERNMENT CAN REALLY DO IS CREATE THE  CONDITIONS FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO INVEST AND GROW THE ECONOMY. AND THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTION IS ABOUT.
Jon: DON'T THEY WANT THE SAME THING.
GOVERNMENT CREATING CONDITIONS FOR --
CREATE THE CONDITIONS IN TERMS OF HAVING FOR EXAMPLE PREDICTABLE POLICIES THAT ARE  STABLE AND THEN INCENTIVIZE THE STIMULATING OUR ECONOMY.
SPENDING ROADS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, NOT LIKE BUILDING ROADS THAT WERE NOT WELL SPENT. AND MONEY THAT FLOWED TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT IS THINGS THAT ARE MORE PERMANENT AND LASTING IN NATURE, FOR  EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAD A TAX CODE THAT INCREMENT VIED NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS EASY TO COMPLY  WITH BUT PERMANENT YOU KNEW WHAT THE TAXES WERE NOW AND TEN YEARS FROM NOW AND YOUR RATE OF RETURN  ON INVESTMENT WAS HIGH ENOUGH SO PEOPLE WOULD BE INCENTED IN INVESTING HERE INSTEAD OF SOME  OTHER PLACE.
Jon: WOULDN'T IT BE BEST IF WE JUST STOPPED THE ELECTION AT THAT POINT, BECAUSE --
Jon: YOU ONLY HAVE IT FOR TWO YEARS.
YOU ARE SAYING IT CAN BE CHANGED AT ANY TIME. CERTAINLY THAT IS TRUE, BUT WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A TAX CODE THAT IS SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF  THIS YEAR.
Jon: OH, MY GOD, THAT IS AWESOME.
WELL, NOT THE WHOLE TAX CODE.
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY!
YOU ARE BUSY. DO YOU WANT TO WEB IT A LITTLE BIT OR HAVE TO GO.
Jon:.
WE CAN GO TO THE WEB.
Jon: WE WILL BE BACK. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO. STAY WITH US.
