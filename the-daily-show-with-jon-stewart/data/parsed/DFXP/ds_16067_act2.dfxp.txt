[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M SPEAKING TO YOU THIS NIGHT, THE NIGHT I'M SPEAKING TO YOU, THE  NIGHT OF MAY THE 18th IN THE YEAR OF SOMEONE'S LORD 2011. THIS COULD VERY POSSIBLY BE THE SECOND TO LAST "THE DAILY SHOW" EVER.
A CALIFORNIA RADIO STATION PAID FOR HUNDREDS OF BILLBOARDS TO WARN DRIVERS ON THEIR WAY TO  WORK THAT THEY HAVE LESS THAN A MONTH BEFORE THE END OF WORLD AS WE KNOW IT.
89-YEAR-OLD RADIO HOST SAYS THE WORLD IS GOING TO END NEXT SATURDAY.
Jon: HE'S 89. [LAUGHTER] ACTUARILY SPEAKING HE IS PROBABLY NOT THAT FAR OFF. [LAUGHTER] SERIOUSLY HOW MUCH LONGER CAN HE LAST? YOU TAKE THIS TYPE OF FUNDAMENTALIST FEAR-MONGERING SERIOUSLY. EVERYONE KNOWS THE WORLD IS NOT ENDING BECAUSE OF GOD'S WRATH BUT A FORCE MORE POWERFUL. THE DEMOCRAT LIMIT.
THE COUNTRY WILL REACH THE LIMIT BY MAY 16 THANK IS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THE U.S. CAN BORROW. CONGRESS HAS TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING.
FAILING TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING WOULD BE ARMAGEDDON LIKE.
A FORMULA FOR RECESSION OR WORSE.
CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.
ARMAGEDDON.
ARMAGEDDON, OKAY. IT WOULD BE THE WORST OF ALL FINANCIAL WORDS ECONOMICALLY.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN OUR RECORD $14.3 TRILLION DEBT IS THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO  MAKE IT BIGGER. THANK GOODNESS WE HAVEN'T HIT IT YET.
IT'S OFFICIAL THE U.S. HAS HIT THE DEBT CEILING.
Jon: ABANDON SHIP! ABANDON SHIP! BASICKERS AT CHILDREN THEY HAD WITH THEIR SECOND WIVES FIRST. DANGER DANGER --  [LAUGHTER] ASK YOUR PARENTS. THIS IS BIG. EVERY AMERICAN HAS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS. HELP US NEWS NETWORKS YOU ARE OUR ONLY HOPE.
EMERGENCY MEASURES UNDERWAY THIS MORNING TO CREATE SOME HEADROOM AFTER THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HIT EUGTS DEBT CEILING.
Jon: GIVE IT UP FOR DJ NEWS AND THE DEBT CEILING BAND. DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE PIMPED OUT AND JAZZED UP. JUST EXPLAIN IT.
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HIT THE END OF ITS CREDIT LINE TODAY, THE LEGAL LIMIT FOR THE  AMOUNT OF MONEY IT CAN BORROW. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M SORRY I DIDN'T --  [LAUGHTER] -- I DIDN'T CATCH THAT. I WAS HAVING THIS DREAM. I WAS DRIVING A CAR WITH NO STEERING WHEEL INTO THE OCEAN.yM THEN MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST GAVE  ME A POISE SON TURKEY SANDWICH. WITH YOU THEN IT WAS A GIANT PIZZA AND THERE WAS AN EXTRA LEFT HAND WHERE MY MEANOUS SHOULD BE. [LAUGHTER] FHAT ISï¿½r THE OFFICIAL WAY THAT YOU STAND WHEN YOUR PENIS WAVES HELLO TO PEOPLE. YOU'RE KILLING SUAREZ. BETWEEN CNN AND PBS THERE AS THAT-TO-BE MIDDLE GROUND  [SCREAMS] TURNS OUT CNN WAS THE MIDDLE GROUND. [LAUGHTER] ACTUALLY WAS THE TOP OF KNEEL -- NEIL CAVUTO'S SHOW. HE WASN'T PANICKING. HE WAS MOCKING THE IDEA OF PANICKING.
I'M NEIL CAVUTO STILL BREATHING. TODAY WE HIT THE DEBT CEILING BUT AMERICA DIDN'T HIT THE WALL OR THE FAN. I WANT YOU TO LOOK AROUND. LIFE AS WE KNOW IT IS GOING ON IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
UCONN FUSE BUSINESS REPORTING WITH LETTER REPORTING. FINANCIAL DISASTERS CAN'T BE INSTANTLY VIEWED FOR THE WINDOW. IF THE MELTDOWN COMES YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE PEOPLE EATING ON HUMAN FLESH AND WEARING KISS  ME I'M BANKRUPT SHIRTS. THOSE ARE GOING TO BE BIG, BY THE WAY. [LAUGHTER] I TAKE HIS POINT FEAR-MONGERING ABOUT THE DEBT CEILING ISN'T NECESSARY. THAT SORT OF OVER-THE-TOP HYPERBOLE SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR GOVERNMENT SPENDING.
HURRICANE BARACK IS ALREADY HERE. A FULL FLEDGED CATEGORY PHIFER. A SPENDING STORM SO BIG AND GETTING SO MUCH BIGGER ALL I CAN SAY IS SEEK SHELTER AND NOW.
Jon: IT'S A FINANCIAL KATRINA. BARACK OBAMA DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE'S MONEY. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, IF WE DO HIT THE DEBT CEILING AND WE DID HIT THE DEBT CEILING ON MONDAY, WHY  DIDN'T WE DEFAULT OUR DEBT?
TREASURY SECRETARY TIM GEITHNER SAID HE IS SUSPENDED INVESTMENTS INTO FEDERAL  RETIREMENT FUNDS SO THE GOVERNMENT CAN CONTINUE TO BORROW MONEY TO PATE BILLS THAT  CONGRESS HAS ALREADY SIGNED.
Jon: I'M GOING TO RIP THAT (bleep) SOUNDTRACK OUT OF THAT NETWORK. BASICALLY THE WAY WE'VE AVOIDED THE DEBT PROBLEM IS WE'RE TAKING  THE MONEY OUT OF OLD PEOPLE'S PENSIONS. SO EVEN IF SATURDAY ARMAGEDDON GUY IS WRONG, HE'S STILL (bleep). WE'LL
