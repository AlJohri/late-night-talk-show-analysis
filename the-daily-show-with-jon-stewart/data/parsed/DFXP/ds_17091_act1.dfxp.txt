APRIL 19th, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, WHAT'S UP, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, BOOM, MY GUEST TONIGHT, WASHINGTON CRISIS MANAGER JUDEY SMITH WILL BE THE GUEST. BEFORE WE GET GOING I WANT TO ANSWER A QUICK QUESTION THAT A LOT OF VIEWERS ARE  WRITING IN, THE JEWISH MAYOR OF DUBLIN CITY IS ROBERT BRISCO. HIS NAME IS ROBERT BRISCO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I GOT A GUY IN THE AUDIENCE, LITERALLY FLIES HERE FROM DUBLIN JUST TO LET ME NOCHL YOU KNOW WITH HAVE A JEW MAYOR IF DUBLIN. ALL RIGHT, SIR. SO IF YOU COULD TALK TO HIM FOR ME I'D APPRECIATE IT. (LAUGHTER)
I'M GOING THERE. I'M VISITING THERE. AS YOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IS ALL BUT SOWN UP BY NOW  PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE WILLARD SCOTT HITTINGTON ROMNISAURU IS, S SO NOW IT IS TIME FOR  THE GOP TO RALLY BEHIND ITS CANDIDATE AM I TAKE TO YOU FOOTAGE WITH CONVERSATIONS  WITH GOP CONGRESSMAN PANEL SHOT APPARENTLY USING INSTA GRAM'S NEW VIDEO FILTER, '70s FBI UNDERCOVER STING, WHICH MYSPACE APPARENTLY JUST BOUGHT FOR 2K800 MILLION. ANYHOW, HERE IS THEIR RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT MITT ROMNEY.
I'M ACTUALLY EXCITED. I HAVE TO THE ENDORSED ANY CANDIDATE. I'M EXCITED THAT THE PROCESS IS OVER.
THE EXCITEMENT WILL COME FROM GETTING BARACK OBAMA OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
IF YOU ARE'S NOT SURE ABOUT WANTING TO SUPPORT MITT ROMNEY, WHETHER YOU ARE  LIBERAL, WHETHER YOU'RE VERY CONSERVATIVE, YOU OUGHT TO BE EXCITED. BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ON YOUR SIDE AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT, GOOD ONE, REPRESENTATIVE BLUR FACE SMUDGEENSTEIN. SO THEY'RE COMING ALONG SLOWLY TO ROMNEY. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE HATE CELL PHOENIX I JUST WANT TO POINT THIS OCCUPANT YOU CANNOT IN  THIS WORLD ANY MORE [BLEEP] TALK ABOUT ANYBODY. SOMEBODY'S CATCHING IT ON THEIR FOCHBLT IT'S LIKE WE'RE ALL PARANOID MOBSTERS, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ROMNEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY, LET'S TAKE A WALK  TO THE CANDY STOFERMENT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK ABOUT ROMNEY, PUT A NEWSPAPER UP IN FRONT OF  YOUR FACE, BOOM. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THESE ARE CONGRESS PEOPLE, NOT THEIR JOB TO GET MITT ROMNEY ELECTED. THEIR JOB TO STOP THE CURRENT PRESIDENT FROM GETTING ANYTHING DONE. ROMNEY'S ELECTION IS FOX'S JOB. IT'S TO THE GOING TO BE A SLAM-DUNK EITHER BECAUSE DURING THE PRIMARY ROMNEY'S  NOMINATION WAS NOT UNANIMOUS.
I AM NOT CONVINCED AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE MAJORITY OF GOP AND  INDEPENDENT VOTERS ARE CONVINCED, AND THAT IS WHY YOU DON'T SEE ROMNEY GET OVER THAT HUMP.
HE'S A NORTHEASTERN REPUBLICAN. HE IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE, SO I MEAN I'M NOT A BIG FAN. MY FIRST CHOICE WAS MITCH DANIELS AND IT WASN'T A SECRET.
Jon: THAT'S NOT SOED BACHLT HIS FIRST CHOICE WAS MITCH DANIEL, ROMNEY  PROBABLY SECOND CHOICE.
MY SECOND WAS PAUL RYAN. I TRIED TO WRESTLE UP A POSE TO FORCE HIM NOT RACE.
Jon: -- THERE'S NO SHAME IN THIRD PLACE.
MY THIRD RASS CHRISTIE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: MY FOURTH WAS THE GHOST OF DWIGHT EISENHOWER. MY FIFTH WAS THE CHARACTER OF RON SWANSON ON NBC'S PARKS & RECREATION. MY SIXTH WAS PARLIAMENT FUNK DELIC GEORGE CLINTON. I REALLY DON'T LIKE MITT ROMNEY. SO HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE THIS PIVOT. SARAH PALIN WAS NOT CONVINCED THAT MITT ROMNEY IS CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH. SHE TOLD PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR NEWT GINGRICH, FOR GOD'S SAKES. IS SHE CONVINCED NOW, IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO MONTHS.
I'M CONVINCED.
Jon: OKAY, I GUESS SHE IS CONVINCED NOW. THAT IS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT PALIN, OPEN MINDED. SO WHAT CONVINCED HER?
I AM CONVINCED THAT GOVERNOR ROMNEY, WILL KNOW TO SURROUND HIMSELF WITH  THOSE WHO INHERENTLY KNOW TO GO RIGHT TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF SMALLER, SMARTER GOVERNMENT. AND THAT GIVES ME A LOT OF COMFORT.
Jon: BASICALLY SHE'S SAYING DON'T TRUST ROMNEY. BUT I TRUST EVERYONE HE'LL HIRE. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I-- IT'S LIKE HOW VEGANS SELL YOU ON T, FU, I KNOW IT TASTES LIKE  [BLEEP], JUST PUT ENOUGH RICE AND SOY SAUCE YOU BARELY EVEN KNOW YOU ARE EATING CURDLED SOYBEAN, IT  WILL BE FINE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD. KARAUTHAMMER HAS A LONGER VOICE TO TRAVEL.
YOU'RE NOT A BIG FAN THOUGH OF MITT ROMNEY. I JUST, I JUST SUSPECT THAT YOU DON'T SEE HIM AS A KIND OF GUY WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE  IN THE WHITE HOUSE M I WRONG?
YOU'RE WRONG. I ACTUALLY LIKE ROMNEY. I THINK HE'S A VERY GOOD MAN. AND I THINK HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD PRESIDENT.
Jon: BUT YOU-- HE WASN'T EVEN YOUR TOP, LIKE 20 BEFORE. (LAUGHTER) I LIKE HIM, HE'S NOT AS GOOD AS MY 7th CHOICE WHICH WAS A PLATE OF COLD CUTS IN THE  SHAPE OF A FACE. PERHAPS THE MOST ACROBATIC PIVOT TOWARDS ROMNEY WAS ACCOMPLISHED COUNTERINTUITIVELY BY  POLITICAL PUNDIT AND A MAN WHOSE VOICE CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS POSTMENOPAUSAL, DICK MORRIS.
MY VIEW IS THAT FIRST I DO NOT LIKE ROMNEY THERE IS NO WAY THIS GUY IS GOING TO  GET NO NATURED WITH HIM HAVING PASSED THE EQUIVALENT OF BAMACARE.
BIG PARTY IS NEVER GOING TO NOMINATE SOMEBODY WHO IS SOFT ON THIS ISSUE.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M TELLING YOU, ROMNEY ROMNEY-- ROMNEY IS TOAST. I WOULD STAKE MY REPUTATION. FOR HONESTY AND POLITICAL INSIGHT. NOW IF WILL YOU EXCUSE ME, ROSE, BLANCH, SOFIA AND I HAVE AN AMARETTO CHEESECAKE WE HAVE TO GET TO. (APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS A PRETTY HARD-CORE SLAM ON ROMNEY. THIS PIVOT NOW THAT HE'S GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE SHOULD BE INTERESTING.
IN TERMS OF THE FACTOR OF WILL CONSERVATIVES RALLY TO ROMNEY, I THINK THEY UNDOUBTEDLY AND  UNQUESTIONABLY WILL IN MASSIVE NUMBERS WITH TREMENDOUS ENTHUSIASM. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING ME? CONSERVATIVES WILL NEVER GO FOR THIS GUY TO HE'S THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED REAGAN. THAT IS A SERIOUS PIVOT. I WILL GIVE DICK MORRIS THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. PERHAPS HE SPENT SOME TIME WITH MR. ROMNEY, HAS LEARNED ABOUT HIS POSITION,S HAD AN  EPIPHANY, A CONVERSION, IF YOU WILL, BASED ON PRINCIPLES. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT UNTIL OR UNLESS I'M PRESENTED WITH EVIDENCE  THAT THIS WAS, IN FACT, A CYNICAL OPPORTUNISTIC AND UTTERLY WITHOUT FOUNDATION  CONVERSION BASED SOLELY ON SLIGHTLY EASING DICK MORRIS'S ALREADY DISINGENUOUS PARTISAN  SALESMANSHIP JOB.
I DECIDED A COUPLE OF MONTHS OR TWO AGO TO STOP DUMPING ON MITT ROMNEY. NOT BECAUSE I APPROVE OF ROMNEYCARE, TO THE BECAUSE I APPROVE OF HIS FLOP FLIP ON  ABORTION, BUT BECAUSE I MAY HAVE TO BE ONE OF THOSE WHO CARRIES THIS GUY FOR A  COUPLE OF MONTHS WHEN HE'S RUNNING AGAINST OBAMA AND I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MY OWN AS  IFINGED-- TASK HARDER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: MY POINT IS THIS. I MAY BE UNPRINCIPAL-- PRINCIPLESED, BUT I AM ALSO VERY LAZY. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
