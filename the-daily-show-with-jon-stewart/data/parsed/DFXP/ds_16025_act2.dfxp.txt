Jon: WELCOME BACK. THE LABOR UNREST IN WISCONSIN, ITS EFFECTS GO FAR BEYOND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AS PAUL RYAN REMINDS US.
PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEIR WAY BUT WE HAVE TO GET THIS DEFICIT AND DEBT  UNDER CONTROL IN MADISON IF WE WANT TO HAVE A GOOD BUSINESS CLIMATE AND JOB CREATION IN WISCONSIN.
Jon: YES BECAUSE IF ANYONE KNOWS WHAT MAKES A WELCOMING CLIMATE, IT'S WISCONSIN. BUT HE MAKES A GOOD POINT. THIS COUNTRY MUST MAKE CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT WE DO BUSINESS. IF WE ARE TO APPEAL MORE TO CORPORATIONS. SO AMERICAN WORK FORCE, MEET ME AT CAMERA 3. HOW ARE YOU DOING? DOING GOOD? YOU'RE A LITTLE ANGRY. AREN'T YOU? YOU'RE A LITTLE ANGRY. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY CORPORATIONS DON'T LOOK AT YOU. THE SAME WAY THEY DID IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS. BEFORE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ALLOWED YOU TO LIMIT WHEN AND WHERE THEY COULD LOOK AT YOU. YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE MAKING THE SACRIFICES NECESSARY TO RAISE A MIDDLE CLASS TOGETHER  WITH A CORPORATION BUT WHILE YOU WERE HOME ON WEEKENDS OR FEDERALLY MANDATED HOLIDAYS OR  HAVING YOUR DENTAL WORK, YOUR CORPORATION WAS OFF BANGING MEXICO, INDIA OR CHINA'S INDUSTRIES. AND NOW YOU WANT 'EM BACK. WELL IT'S NOT LIKE HE HASN'T BEEN TELLING YOU WHAT TURNS HIM ON.
I WOULD ARGUE THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL TAX CUTS WE NEED TO MAKE. WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH A 35% TAX ON BUSINESS WHEN THE WORLD AVERAGE IS 18%, WE'RE  INCREASINGLY UNCOMPETITIVE.
Jon: WHO WANTS 35 WHEN THEY CAN GET 18? LIKE ANY RED BLOODED AMERICAN COMPANY, HE WANTS A CORPORATE TAX RATE THAT IS BARELY LEGAL. AND BELIEVE ME, HE COULD GET THAT IN CAMBODIA, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. THAT'S JUST FOR STARTERS. IN THE OLD DAYS AMERICAN WORKER, YOU WERE WILD AND EXCITING. YOU WOULD DO IT ALL NIGHT AND ALL DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK IN EVERY ROOM. EVEN THE ONES WITH NO FIRE EXITS. BUT NOW WHEN HE ROLLS OVER AND HE ANNOUNCES HE WANTS TO START DRILLING YOU'RE ALL, OH, NO, MISTER, NOT HERE. NOT WITHOUT PROTECTION.
DOCUMENTS DESCRIBE BAD WIRING AND A LEAK IN THE SO- CALLED BLOW-OUT PREVENTER. EVEN A DEAD BATTERY MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN IT ALL. MEMBERS SAY THIS PROVES THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE REGULATION.
Jon: BUT WHEN I WEAR A BLOW- OUT PREVENTER, I BARELY FEEL LIKE I'M DRILLING. AND THE CONSTANT NAGGING.
CORPORATIONS LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES WILL NOT SELF REGULATE. BP, WALL STREET ARE ALL EXAMPLES.
Jon: LEAVE WALL STREET ALONE. THEN THEY RUIN THE ECONOMY. LEAVE THE OIL COMPANIES ALONE AND THEN THEY RUIN THE GULF. YOU CAN'T TRUST THE CORPORATIONS TO POLICE THEMSELVES.
Jon: INDIA AND CHINA UNDERSTAND CORPORATIONS. INDIA AND CHINA LET THEM BE THEMSELVES. THE CORPORATION WANTS TO COME HOME LATE AND GO WAKE THE KIDS UP BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR THEIR  SHIFT, THAT'S COOL. THEY JUST WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY. LOOK, YOU KNEW THEY WERE SOCIOPATHS WHEN HE MARRIED THEM. NOT THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN HINTS AT WHAT YOU MIGHT DO TO CREATE A MORE WELCOME  CORPORATE ATMOSPHERE.
IT'S TIME FOR UNIONS TO STEP FORWARD AND TAKE A CUT. IF WE DON'T CUT THE SIZE OF THE PAYROLL OR CUT SALARIES HERE, WE CAN'T AFFORD THE  SERVICES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT WORK.
THE AVERAGE TEACHER SALARY IN WISCONSIN, HERE IT IS. $51,121. THAT'S JUST SALARIES.
Jon: PRETTY NICE, PROFESSOR TRUMP. SO, AMERICAN WORKERS, SLIM DOWN. WORK MORE. FOR LESS. (BEEP) CONDITIONS. I'M NOT TALKING HALF PAY SATURDAYS AND PARTIAL DENTAL. OH, THE CORPORATIONS ARE SAYING YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD AND THEY REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORT. BUT THE TRUTH IS, IF YOU WANT FIRST WORLD CORPORATIONS TO THINK YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A THIRD WORLD MAKEOVER. THIS FAMILY DOES YOUR JOB FOR 70 PESOS A WEEK. IF YOU REALLY WANT CORPORATIONS BACK AND YOU REALLY MEAN IT, NEXT YEAR'S  CHRISTMAS CARD COULD BE A REALITY. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO WANT IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
