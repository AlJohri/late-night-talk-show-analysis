(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. OH, MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE DIRECTOR OF SOME OF THE BIGGEST FILMS IN HISTORY. HE SERVES AS EXECUTIVE PRODUCER FOR RED TAIL.
I'M BEHIND YOU.
MAKE WAY.
CONGRATULATIONS, CAPTAIN, YOU ARE THE FIRST NEGRO TO DO THAT.
Jon: TRUST THE FORCE. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, GEORGE LUCAS. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD.
Jon: THE LOOK OF THIS. THE FILM IS REALLY EXCITING. HOW DO YOU CAPTURE, IT'S GOT THE LOOK AND A FEEL OF THE FILM FROM THE '40s.
IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE A FILM DURING THE WAR. IT'S VERY PATRIOTIC. VERY OLD FASHIONED, CORNEY. IT'S JUST EXACTLY LIKE FLYING LEATHER NECKS ONLY THIS ONE WAS HELD UP FOR RELEASE FROM  1942 WHEN IT WAS SHOT AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT RELEASED EVER SINCE.
Jon: YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET IT MADE. MAYBE WHEN YOU GET SOME SWAY IN HOLLYWOOD YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET A CHANCE TO DO THAT.
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY.
Jon: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING ON THIS.
23 YEARS. FINANCED IT MYSELF. I FIGURED IF I COULD GET THE ADS PAID FOR BY THE STUDIOS AND THEY WOULD RELEASE IT. I SHOWED IT TO ALL OF THEM AND THEY SAID NO. WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO MARKET A MOVIE LIKE THIS.
Jon: WHY?
IT'S NOT GREEN ENOUGH. THEY ONLY RELEASE GREEN MOVIES.
Jon: THE MESSAGE BECAUSE THE MESSAGE IS PATRIOTIC AND JINGOISTIC AND DOESN'T HAVE  ANY RECYCLING IN IT, THAT'S THE PROBLEM?
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S AN ALL BLACK MOVIE. THERE'S NO MAJOR WHITE ROLES IN IT AT ALL. IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST ALL BLACK ACTION PICTURES EVER MADE.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
YEAH. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: BUT THE SCENE IN IT WHEN HITLER TELLS CUBA GOODING JR. THAT HE'S HIS FATHER....
NO, NO, NO.
Jon: WERE YOU TEMPTED AT ALL TO PUT THAT IN? HITLER WALKS UP AND LIKE I AM YOUR FATHER?
NO, NO, NO. CUBA GOODING JR. GOES OUT AND HE GOES BACK HOME AND IT'S, YOU KNOW, JAMES EARL JONES PLAYING HIS FATHER. DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.
Jon: I AM YOUR FATHER. IN THIS DAY AND AGE, THAT'S A DIFFICULT... IS IT BECAUSE OF THE PEDIGREE OF IT? THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE ON IT?
YEAH. REASONABLY EXPENSIVE MOVIE. NORMALLY BLACK MOVIES, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE VERY LOW BUDGET. THEY WON'T EVEN... EVEN THESE MOVIES IT GOES TO ONE OF THE LOWER NOT MAJOR DISTRIBUTORS. THEY DO WELL BUT THEY DO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY. THEY KNOW WHAT THAT IS. THIS COSTS MORE THAN WHAT THOSE MOVIES MAKE. SO THEY FIGURE, WELL. AND THEY DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY FOREIGN MARKET FOR IT. THAT'S 60% OF THEIR PROFIT.
Jon: IT IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR YOU DISCUSS THIS MOVIE IN THE PURE ECONOMIC AND  POLITICAL REALITIES OF IT GETTING MADE. WHY DIDN'T YOU GET A DISTRIBUTOR? THEY JUDGE THE FOREIGN BOX OFFICE ON IT RATHER THAN LIKE THEY THOUGHT IT SUCKED. YOU WISH THEY WOULD EXPRESS A CULTURAL OR A CRITIQUE IN TERMS OF HOW THEY WOULD DECIDE  UPON THIS AND NOT BASED ON PURE BUSINESS MODEL.
IT WAS PRESENTED AS, WHICH IS THE REASON I DID IT COMPLETELY, I WANTED TO MAKE  AN INSPIRATIONAL FOR TEEN-AGED BOYS. I WANTED TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE HEROES. THEY'RE REAL AMERICAN HEROES. THEY'RE PATRIOTS AND HELPED US MAKE COUNTRY WHAT IT IS TODAY. IT'S NOT GOREY WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF WHITE OFFICERS RUNNING THESE GUYS INTO CANNON FODDER. THEY WERE REAL HEROES. BOMBER PILOT.
Jon: YOU ASKED SOME OF THE AIRMEN TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS. UNFORTUNATELY OVER TIME OBVIOUSLY AS THEY GET MUCH OLDER....
WE STARTED OUT WITH 40. WE'RE DOWN TO ABOUT 7. YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE PRESSURE ON ME TO GET THIS DONE BEFORE WE'RE ALL GONE. I WAS WORKING VERY HARD, GETTING SCRIPTS. THE PROBLEM WAS IS IT'S EXACTLY LIKE STAR WARS WHICH IS....
Jon: WHAT?
IT'S EXACTLY LIKE STAR WARS. I WROTE THE FIRST SCRIPT. I TRIED TO GET IT TO WORK. IT WAS WAY TOO BIG. THE STORY IS TOO FANTASTIC AND WONDERFUL TO CRAM INTO TWO HOURS.
Jon: ARE YOU TELLING ME THERE'S GOING TO BE SIX OF THESE BAD BOYS?
I AM HOPING IF THIS WORKS, IF WE GET A GOOD FIRST WEEKEND THERE IS A PREQUEL AND A SEQUEL.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
AND THEY'RE BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE BY A LONG SHOT. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: (LAUGHING). OH, THAT IS FUNNY.
I TOOK THE SOFT CENTER. I SAID I'LL GIVE YOU THE REALLY GOOD ONES IF WE CAN GET THIS ONE TO GET MADE.
Jon: DO YOU ALWAYS THINK IN TERMS OF OPUSS?
NO. THAT'S WHY I TOOK SO LONG. I'M GOING TO SQUEEZE THIS DOWN AND MAKE THIS WORK. EVERY TIME WE DO A SCRIPT, WELL, WE HAVE TO DO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TRAINING AND TUSKEGEE AND ALL THE PROBLEMS  AND THE RACISM. THEN WHEN THEY CAME BACK AFTER THE WAR THEY BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, BOYCOTTED AN OFFICERS'  CLUB AND STARTED THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.
Jon: THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS TO SWALLOW ABOUT WORLD WAR II IS  THE SOLDIERS AND THE AMERICANS' MILITARY HISTORY IN GENERAL, THE BLACK SOLDIERS  FIGHTING HEROICALLY OVERSEAS AND THEN COMING HOME TO SECOND CLASS TREATMENT, TO NOT BEING  ABLE TO EAT IN CERTAIN PLACES. THAT IS SEEMINGLY ONE OF THE MORE OFFENSIVE MOMENTS.
WELL, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE ABOUT VICTIMS. THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT HEROES. SO WE HAVE IT BURIED DEEP IN OUR HEAD TO SAY, LOOK, THESE GUYS ARE HEROES.
Jon: HOW DID THEY FEEL WATCHING IT? WHAT WAS THE RESPONSE OF THE GUYS? I IMAGINE THAT IS THE AUDIENCE THAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO PLEASE AND THE ONE THAT  MEANS THE MOST TO YOU.
I WAS WORRIED. I WAS REALLY WORRIED BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE. THEY DID IT. DON'T FORGET TO INCLUDE THIS AND THAT. I SAID, I'M TAKING A VERY NARROW SWATH. I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT A BUNCH OF GUYS, KIDS, 19, 20 YEARS OLD, FLYING THE FASTEST PROP  PLANE EVER BUILT AND GOING UP AGAINST THE NEW-FANGLED JETS. IT'S A COMBAT MOVIE. YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY HONESTLY DONE. THIS IS AS CLOSE AS YOU'LL EVER GET TO EPISODE 7. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE? YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME HANGING LIKE THIS. DID THEY COME UP TO YOU WITH TEARS IN YOUR EYES AND SAY, YOU CAPTURED MY LIFE. I LOVE YOU. OR DID THEY....
THEY WERE TEARS IN THE EYES. THEY'RE OVERWHELMED BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG TO BE RECOGNIZED. MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. THEY ARE REALLY TRUE HEROES. I WORKED WITH ALL THESE GUYS. THEY'RE GREAT GREAT GUYS. JUST TO BE RECOGNIZED. THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN, I KNOW WHO THEY ARE. WE HAVE HAD BOMBER PILOTS SEE THE FILM AND STUFF AND THEY WOULD TEAR UP. THOSE GUYS SAVED MY LIFE. THEY FOLLOWED US ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BASE. THEY'RE THE TRUE HEROES OF WORLD WAR II.
Jon: I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVENTIONS 20 YEARS DOWN THE LINE WHERE THEY ALL COME.
(LAUGHING).
Jon: IN THE THEATERS ON JANUARY 20. GEORGE LUCAS, EVERYBODY. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
