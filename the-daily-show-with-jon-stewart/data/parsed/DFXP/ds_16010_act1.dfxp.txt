JANUARY 18, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WHAT A GUEST WE HAVE FOR YOU TONIGHT. ASTROPHYSICIST IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. ASTRO PHYSICIAN... ASTROPHYSICIST. BUT FIRST, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SOME MUCH NEEDED GOOD NEWS OUT OF TUCSON. THE VICTIM IS MAKING A MIRACULOUSLY RECOVERY AND IS NOW APPARENTLY SITTING UPRIGHT  AND COMMUNICATING. JOINING ME TONIGHT FROM AL ALASKA IS GOVERNOR SARAH PALIN.
THANKS, JON.
Jon: I'M SORRY. A BIT OF A MISDIRECT. WASN'T IT? ACTUALLY A LOT OF THE CREDIT FOR MRS. PALIN'S RECOVERY AFTER SHE WAS UNFAIRLY LINKED  TO THE SHOOTINGS HAS TO GO TO HER NURSE SEAN HANNITY WHO IT WAS CLEAR FROM LAST NIGHT'S  INTERVIEW WAS READY TO UPGRADE PALIN'S VICTIM STATUS FROM INNOCENT TO JOAN OF ARC.
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE CRITICS? WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SINGLED OUT AND THE LEFT SINGLED YOU OUT? YOU SPECIFICALLY SAID WHEN THESE WAR TERMS ARE USED THIS IS NOT A CALL FOR VIOLENCE. ALL OF THAT WAS IGNORED BY THE MEDIA. DOES THAT FRUSTRATE YOU? I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE LEFT HAVE BEEN VERY CIVIL TOWARDS YOU OVER THE YEARS. I REALLY DON'T HEAR YOU COMPLAINING A LOT ABOUT IT.
Jon: YOU DON'T? REALLY? YOU DON'T HEAR HER COMPLAINING ABOUT IT? YOU SHOULD MAYBE WATCH HER WHEN SHE APPEARS ON THE SHOW, ON THE SEAN HANNITY SHOW BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO SEE THROUGH ALL THE PLUMES OF ASS  SMOKE YOU'RE BLOWING. BUT IS IT HARD TO HEAR TOO? BECAUSE WATCHING THE TWO OF YOU INSISTING ON HER EASY-GOING NATURE REMINDS ME OF TAKING MY  GRANDMOTHER OUT TO EAT. YOU KNOW ME. I'M EASY. I'M NOT A COMPLAINER. IS IT COLD IN HERE? YOU WOULD THINK AT THESE PRICES THEY'D SHUT A WINDOW. NOT THAT THE GOVERNOR DIDN'T HAVE A VALID COMPLAINT.
IN A SITUATION LIKE WE HAVE JUST FACED IN THESE LAST EIGHT DAYS OF BEING FALSELY ACCUSED, OF BEING ACCESSORY TO MURDER I AND OTHERS NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TOO ARE SHEDDING TRUTH, SHEDDING LIGHT ON TRUTH. LIVES WERE LOST. PEOPLE WERE INJURED. A CRAZED GUNMAN THAT I AND YOU AND OTHERS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH INFLUENCING HIM. HE IS THE SOLE PERSON I BELIEVE TO BLAME IN THIS.
Jon: CORRECT. I AGREE WITH GOVERNOR PALIN. THAT IS TOTALLY FAIR. IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTER MATH OF THE TRAGEDY IT WAS UNDULY AND UNNECESSARILY POLITICIZED. GOVERNOR, ARE YOU HAPPY? NOW LOSE ME. IN THE SAME INTERVIEW, REFERRING TO THE GUNMAN THIS WAY.
AN APOLITICAL OR PERHAPS EVEN LEFT-LEANING CRIMINAL WHO KILLED THESE INNOCENTS.
Jon: WHAT? DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID RIGHT THERE? DID YOU SEE IT? THERE MUST BE A WORD FOR COMPLAINING VOCIFEROUSLY ABOUT A WRONG BEING DONE TO YOU  WHILE CASUALLY COMMITTING SAID WRONG YOURSELF WITH NO AWARENESS. IF IT'S NOT A WORD LET'S COME WITH UP. LET'S CALL IT AN ANCHORAGE STEAMER. WAIT, NO. HOLD ON. A PALIN-DROME. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. IN THE INTERVIEW, IN THE INTERVIEW, GOVERNOR PALIN WAS RIGHTLY ANNOYED THAT PEOPLE  READ INTO HER CROSS HAIRS MAP AND HER DON'T RETREAT RELOAD STATEMENTS AS AN ATTEMPT TO INCITE.
WELL, I HAVE REPEATED OVER AND OVER MY CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE AND SPECIFICALLY  TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BEING UP IN ARMS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GET TO GO  THE VOTING BOOTH. BUT THAT WAS FRUSTRATING.
Jon: YOU SEE? SHE'S FRUSTRATED. IT'S FRUSTRATING TO SARAH PALIN TO HAVE PEOPLE ASCRIBE OVERWHELMINGLY NEGATIVE  MOTIVATIONS TO HER INNOCENT ACTIONS. AND THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. BY THE WAY, WHY DID PEOPLE LINK HER TO THE SHOOTING IN TUCSON? HERE COMES THE CARIBOU BALL SWITCH HE WILL.
THOSE ON THE LEFT HATE MY MESSAGE. THEY'LL DO ALL THAT THEY CAN TO STOP ME. THERE ARE MANY ON THE LEFT, MANY CRITICS WHO DON'T WANT, FOR INSTANCE, CONGRESS TO BUCKLE DOWN, GET BACK TO WORK. THERE'S THIS TRIFECTA THING GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW THAT IS GOING TO BRING  AMERICA TO HER KNEES.
Jon: DO YOU SEE WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE? YOUR CRITICS AREN'T MOTIVATED BY A SINCERE BELIEF IN THE CORROSIVE NATURE OF YOUR  RECEIPT I CAN, THEY MUST ONLY SEE AMERICA BROUGHT TO HER KNEES AND DO ANYTHING TO KEEP  THEIR FOOT ON THE NECK OF AMERICA. THEY ARE WORKING DESPERATELY TO GET AMERICA TO TAP OUT AND BE AWKWARDLY INTERVIEWED  AFTERWARDS BY JOE ROGAN. IS IT POSSIBLE, GOVERNOR, THAT YOU HAVE BECOME A LIGHTNING ROD LESS FOR YOUR CLARITY OF  VISION BUT MORE FOR YOUR ABILITY TO TURN ANY CRITICISM OF YOU INTO PERSECUTION OF YOU? WHILE STILL VERY CASUALLY BEING ABLE TO DISMISS A PRETTY LARGE PORTION OF AMERICA.
THOSE ON THE LEFT, IF IT WEREN'T FOR THEIR DOUBLE STANDARD, THEY'D HAVE NO STANDARDS.
Jon: SOMEONE HAS A NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. I MEAN, DO YOU SEE IT AT ALL? WHICH PERHAPS BRINGS ME TO MY FAVORITE PART OF LAST NIGHT'S PALIN AND HANNITY VICTORY HOUR SPECIAL. THE AUTHOR OF TWO BEST SELLING BOOKS, A HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER AND PAID SPEAKER, A REALITY  SHOW STAR, FACE BOOK TWITTER ADDICT AND COMMENTATOR THAT GOT A NEWS NETWORK TO BUILD  HER HER OWN STUDIO IN HER HOUSE DEFIANTLY SAYS SHE WILL NOT BE SILENCED.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SHUT ME UP. THEY CAN'T MAKE US SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.
Jon: THERE'S NO FORM OF COMMUNICATION YOUR VIEWS DON'T COME FROM. I'M AFRAID TO TURN ON MY HAM RADIO. OR WATCH YOUR NEW SHOW. IN FACT, FROM WHAT I CAN TELL, NOT ONLY DO PEOPLE WANT YOU TO SHOW UP AND TALK, THEY'RE BEGGING YOU TO SHOW UP. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO REFUSES TO GO ON ALL THESE OUTLETS THAT KEEP ASKING YOU TO JOIN THEM  FOR A CONVERSATION. BY THE WAY I'M NO DIFFERENT. JOIN ME. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU. MY STUDIO. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WE'LL DO IT IN MY STUDIO. YOUR WILDERNESS UTOPIA. YOU COULD HAVE GLEN BECK SIT NEXT TO US OR IN BETWEEN US. I WANT HIM TO COME ON TOO. HE WON'T DO IT EITHER. I PROMISE A PLEASANT, RESPECTFUL AND CLASSY CONVERSATION. IT'S ALL PART OF OUR NEW SEGMENT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELL, YOU KNOW HOW TO REACH ME. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
