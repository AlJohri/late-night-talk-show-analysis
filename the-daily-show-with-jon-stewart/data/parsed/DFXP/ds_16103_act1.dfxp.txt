AUGUST 8, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST MARK ADAMS WILL BE HERE. A NEW BOOK ON MACHU PICCHU. AWFULLY A LOT OF FUN TO SAY. MACHU PICCHU. WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A MORE MODERN CIVILIZATION AND ITS MYSTERIOUS DECLINE.
STANDARD AND POORS ONE OF THE AGENCY'S, HAS DROPPED THE U.S. FROM A TRIPLE-A RATING  DOWN TO A DOUBLE-A-PLUS RATING.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. I MEAN FROM TRIPLE-A TO DOUBLE-A -PLUS DOESN'T SOUND THAT BAD. IF YOU WERE GOING TO RENT THE TRIPLE-X MOVIE YOU GOT HOME AND FOUND OUT THAT THE MOVIE  WAS JUST DOUBLE-X-PLUS, ARE YOU GOING TO WORRY THAT THERE WAS NOT QUITE ENOUGH (BEEP)  AND SUCKING TO FILL UP THE APPROXIMATELY FOUR MINUTES YOU'RE GOING TO WATCH IT? I MEAN, SIX MINUTES. LADIES? AND BY THE WAY, THE RATINGS AGENCY IS STANDARD AND POORS. WHO IS GOING TO LISTEN TO A COMPANY WHOSE NAME TRANSLATES TO AVERAGE AND BELOW AVERAGE. THIS IS A BIG NOTHING BURGER.
GLOBAL MARKETS IN TURMOIL.
HIGH AND ANXIETY.
A MANIC MONDAY.
THE DOW PLUNGING THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.
WE ARE DOWN MORE THAN 400 POINTS ON 500 POINTS.
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL CLOSING DOWN 634 POINTS.
ANOTHER HORRENDOUS, RECHED, YOU FILL IN THE ADJECTIVE DAY FOR STOCKS.
Jon: CRASH-A-TROCIOUS. DIARRHEA-TASTICALLY. THAT'S AN ADD VERB. SO THEY DOWNGRADED AND THE STOCK MARKET TANKS. WAIT A MINUTE. WHY WOULD THAT HAPPEN? STANDARD AND POORS, THAT NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR TO ME.
THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO GAVE THE CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH TO THE MORTGAGE SECURITIES THAT  WERE TOXIC.
Jon: NO, NO, THAT'S NOT IT. STANDARD AND POORS. I THINK IT WAS A COP SHOW. WASN'T IT? DETROIT CRIME JUST GOT DOWNGRADED. PRETTY SURE THAT WAS STANDARD AND POORS.
THEY WERE GIVING TRIPLE-A RATINGS, GOLD RATINGS IN EFFECT TO MORTGAGE-BACKED  SECURITIES THAT WERE WORTHLESS.
Jon: NO, NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'S THEM. I'M GOING TO STICK WITH THE COP SHOW DUO. THAT'S MY FINAL ANSWER. MEAN IF IT WAS THE SAME RATINGS COMPANY, SO CRUCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VERY  FINANCIAL PREDICAMENT WE FIND OURSELVES IN NOW, THAT WOULD BE A REAL SLAP IN THE FACE. I MEAN MAYBE STANDARD AND POORS ARE INCREDIBLY TOUGH GRADERS. ARE THERE OTHER COUNTRIES WITH TRIPLE-A RATINGS.
AUSTRALIA, DENMARK DENMARK, GERMANY, THE NETHERLANDS, SWEDEN, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EVEN THE ISLE OF MANN RIGHT OFF THE COAST OF THE U.K.
Jon: OUCH. WE'RE BELOW ISLE OF MANN, THIS PLACE? ♪ LET'S GIVE THE BOY A HAND ♪♪
Jon: THAT PLACE HAS BETTER CREDIT THAN WE DO? THERE'S NO INDUSTRY THERE. THEY JUST HORSE AROUND IN THE POOL ALL DAY. I'M BEING TOLD THAT MAN ISLAND. NOT ISLE OF MANN. WOW, ISLE OF MANN HAS A BETTER CREDIT RATING THAN WE DO. DID I SAY SLAP IN THE FACE? I MEANT... BY THE WAY, IN CALCULATING AND ANALYZING OUR DEBT SITUATION STANDARD AND POORS MADE A $2  TRILLION MISTAKE BUT THEY'RE STICKING WITH THE DOWNGRADE. I CAN'T WAIT TO SAY WHAT THESE MORE ONS SAID IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF OUR DEBT SITUATION. THIS SHOULD BE RICH.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE S&P CITED WHEN MAKING THIS DOWNGRADE DECISION WAS ALL THE  POLITICAL PROBLEMS WE SAW IN CONGRESS AND GETTING EVERYONE TO AGREE TO RAISE THE DEBT LIMIT.
THE TEA PARTY WILL NOT BUDGE ON TAX CUTS AND RIGHT HERE S&P IS SAYING THAT KIND  OF RIGID POSITION WAS A MAJOR REASON FOR THE DOWNGRADE.
ALSO YOU'VE GOT THE EXTERNAL SITUATION. THE REST OF THE WORLD ALSO NOT IN GREAT SHAPE. THE FINAL FACTOR WAS MONETARY POLICY. THAT'S OF COURSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND ITS DECISION ON INTEREST RATES.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. YOUR NAME IS STILL STUPID. STUPID NAME. STANDARD AND POORS. STUPID. YOU'RE SUGGESTING OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM IS RECKLESS POPULATED BY IDEOLOGICAL CHILDREN. WELL, YOU DON'T WATCH THE SUNDAY MORNING NEWS SHOWS.
I THINK IT'S FAILED PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP.
THIS IS WITHOUT QUESTION THE TEA PARTY DOWNGRADE.
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE HAD BEEN UNWILLING TO REFORM THE PROGRAMS.
THE TEA PARTY DOWNGRADE.
EVERY SINGLE TIME... SENATOR, YOU VOTED TO INCREASE THE DEBT.
THE DEBT ALREADY.
Jon: IF THIS IS.
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER, HOWEVER (TALKING STATEMENT).
GENTLEMEN.
Jon: SHUT UP, SHUT UP. I'LL SPRAY YOU LIKE THE DOGS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHO HUMP FOR PLEASURE AND OF COURSE PROFIT. IX-NAY. ON THE. ANDARDS AND ORES. THIS IS HARD. BY THE WAY STANDARD AND POORS, BEFORE YOU BLAME ONE PARTY OVER THE OTHER, NOBODY WAS HAPPY WITH THE RECENT DEBT  CEILING DEAL THAT SEEMED TO INDICATE OUR POLITICAL PARTIES' UNWILLINGNESS AND  INABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WAS TRUE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS FINAL AGREEMENT WE CAME TO AT THE WHITE HOUSE I GOT 98% OF WHAT  I WANTED. I'M PRETTY HAPPY.
Jon: YOU ARE THE WORLD'S MOST MISGUIDED TANGERINE. I'LL TELL YOU, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BOEHNER SAYING HE PRETTY MUCH GOT EVERYTHING HE WANTED  IN A DEAL THAT SEEMED TO DESTROY OUR FINANCIAL STANDING IN THE WORLD SEEMS LIKE A BIT  OF A SLAP IN THE FACE. BUT MAYBE IT'S A WAKE-UP CALL. YOU KNOW, THE ALL KNOWING MARKET AND THE RATINGS AGENCY ENABLERS HELPED CREATE THIS  TERRIFYING RECESSION. WHICH COMBINED WITH OUR GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT'S MASSIVE BAILOUT TO KEEP THESE  FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SOLVENT HAS BALLOONED OUR DEFICIT AND WEAKENED OUR ABILITY TO BATTLE  ITS EFFECTS. THE QUESTION IS, NOW THAT THE U.S. HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED, OUR TREASURY MARKET IN RUINS, WHERE DOES THIS SMART MONEY GO? SHOW US THE WAY, OH, WIZARDS OF WALL STREET.
THE INTERESTING THING IS THE TREASURYS ARE UP.
U.S. TREASURYS ARE NOT GETTING HURT BY THERE.
THERE'S BEEN AN ENORMOUS FLIGHT TO U.S. TREASURYS.
MONEY IS SLOWING INTO WHAT ELSE, U.S. TREASURYS.
Jon: ARE YOU (BEEP) SERIOUS? ARE YOU (BEEP) SERIOUS? THE U.S. GETS DOWNGRADED SO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE FLUSHING THEIR MONEY OUT OF  STOCKS FROM A BOOEN GOOSE TO STASH IT IN THE SAFEST PLACE THEY CAN FIND, FRESHLY  DOWNGRADED U.S. TREASURYS. BASICALLY YOU BURN UP THE (BEEP) HOUSE DOWN AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO COME OVER  AND GO, HEY, IS YOUR BASEMENT STILL STANDING? YOU MIND IF I, YOU KNOW, PUT MY MONEY THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT? JUST UNTIL I CAN FIND A NICER PLACE FOR IT TO LIVE? BETWEEN YOU AND ME SINGAPORE IS LOOKING PRETTY NICE THIS TIME OF YEAR. FORGET, YOU GUYS. WE CAN GO OTHER PLACES FOR MONEY. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN. HEY, WHAT'S UP, ISLE OF MANN? CAN I TALK TO YOU? WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO FLOAT US SOME WHATEVER YOUR CURRENCY IS, MANN-BUCKS. I DON'T KNOW. OH, I SAW THAT FOOTAGE OF THE POOL. IT WAS A (BEEP). WHAT IS THE COUNTRY CODE FOR LUXEMBOURG? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
