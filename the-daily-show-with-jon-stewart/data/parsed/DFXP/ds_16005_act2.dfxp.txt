Jon: WELCOME BACK. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME RIGHT NOW FOCUSING ON A STORY THAT IS IN  NO WAY IN THE NEWS. WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU A FIELD PIECE ABOUT OLD PEOPLE HAVING SEX. IF THIS DOESN'T DISTRACT YOU, I DON'T THINK ANYTHING WILL. IT'S AS NONTIMELY NOW AS IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO.
FLORIDA, EVERY SPRING THOUSANDS FLOCK HERE FOR THE PARTIES, BOOZE AND SEX. THERE'S ONE THING THAT THE LONG-TIME RESIDENTS HAVE TO SAY TO THEM:  JOIN THE CLUB.
I GET A LOT MORE TAIL NOW THAN I EVER DID WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.
REALLY?
ABSOLUTELY. IT'S A GREAT LIFE.
HOW DO YOU SEDUCE A WOMAN|ï¿½ WHEN YOU GO OUT WITH HER? WHAT IS YOUR ICE BREAKER.
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN SCHI SCHITCK. WE MAKE A DATE TO GO TO THE BEACH. SHE SAID EXCUSE ME I'M GOING TO THE SHOWER. I SAY FIEFNL WHILE SHE'S IN THE SHOWER I DISROBE AND GET INTO THE SHOWER WITH ME AND BEFORE  YOU KNOW IT, WE'VE BROKEN THE ICE.
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH FLORIDIAN LAW BUT I THINK IT'S SEXUAL ASSAULT.
YOU CAN CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT BUT IT'S LOVE.
IT'S THIS LOVE CREATING SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.
MORE AND MORE SENIOR CITIZENS ARE ENDING UP HERE IN A GYNECOLOGIST OFFICE, THEIR  DIAGNOSIS, A SEALLY -- SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE.
CONCERNED SENIORS FROM THE JEWISH CENTER ARE TRYING|w1 TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CRISIS.
SENIORS ARE HAVING SEX WITHOUT THINKING OF CONSEQUENCES.
THERE'S SYPHILIS, GONE REA.
THERE'S HERPES, TOO.
THERE'S CUNNILINGISM.
WE KNOW WHAT THAT DID LEAD TO.
THERE'S THE GENITAL WARTS.
ARE THEY CONTAEUG STKPWHRUS THE WARTS? I THINK SO. I DON'T THINK SO. I HAD WARTS NOT RIGHT NOW BUT I HAD THEM.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
WARTS ON MY PENIS. THAT'S WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT. [LAUGHTER]
OKAY. TO WHAT IS THE -- SO WHAT IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN ABOUT SENIORS HAVING SEX BESIDES THE GAGGING  SENSATION THAT COMES OVER ME WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT.
I WOULD HATE TO HAVE MY TOMBSTONE READ I DIED OF HERPES.
IN AN EFFORT TO CURB THE EPIDEMIC THE JCC PRODUCED THIS VIDEO. IT'S CALLED SEX AND THE SENIORS.
CLEVER TITLE. YOU HAD ME AT SEX AND THEN YOU LAST ME THERE.
IN THIS CAUTIONARY CLAYMATION TALE THEY LEARN ABOUT DISEASES  AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFE SEX.
WE'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
YOU KNOW SENIORS THEY'LL TAKE ANYTHING THAT IS FREE.
BUT THE SHOCK THERAPY ISN'T REACHING THOSE WHO NEED IT.
THEY ARE LYING. THEY ARE ALL LYING. THEY ARE FULL OF CRAP.
I HAVEN'T USED A CONDOM IN 40 YEARS. IF I GOT AIDS IT TAKES FIVE YEARS TO DIE FROM IT SO I SHOULD HAVE THOSE YEARS. SO WHAT. I DIED HAVING PLEASURE.
THERE YOU GO.
YOU SHOULD COME OUT WITH US. WE'LL HAVE A GREAT TIME. WE'LL SHOW YOU WHAT THE SENIOR LIFE IS LIKE. ♪ ♪
JACK GAVE ME A TASTE OF A SOUTH FLORIDA NIGHTLIFE AT 3:30 P.M. ♪ ♪

THE JCC AND THE CLAYMATION SCARE VIDEO HAD IT WRONG. THEY NEEDED TO READJUST THEIR THINKING. ♪ OH, MY LOVE, MY DARLING ♪ ♪ I'VE HUNGERED FOR YOUR TOUCH ♪  ♪ ALONE ♪
WAIT, THIS IS THE JCC RIGHT? [LAUGHTER] ♪|ï¿½ OH, MY LOVE ♪
I LEARNED MANY THINGS ON MY TRIP TO SOUTH FLORIDA MOSTLY WHY OUR GRANDPARENTS HAVE SO MUCH  PLASTIC ON THEIR FURNITURE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WE'RE BACK,
