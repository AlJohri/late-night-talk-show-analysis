Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS A CRISIS MANAGEMENT ADVISOR WHO HAS WORKED WITH SOME  HIGH PROFILE PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED GOOD SELF, BAD SELF  TRANSFORMING YOUR WORST QUALITIES INTO YOUR BIGGEST ASSETS. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. PLEASE WELCOME JUDY SMITH. (  APPLAUSE  ) THE BOOK IS GOOD SELF, BAD SELF. YOU ARE BASICALLY, YOU ARE A CRISIS MANAGER. YOU ARE HARVEY KEITEL IN "PULP FICTION". ARE YOU THE FIXER. THEY CALL YOU WHEN THE ROOM IS COVERED IN BLOOD AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. YOU ARE THE FIXER.
I AM THE FIXER. I'M THE FIXER, AND LOVE IT BEEN DOING IT FOR 20 YEARS. AND WHAT WE DO, REALLY, IS WE HELP CORPORATIONS, CELEBRITIES, POLITICIANS.
Jon: THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT MOST.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO HELP YOU YET.
Jon: YOU WILL.
SO IT'S GREAT, YOU KNOW, WE HELP REALLY NAVIGATE THEM AT WORST POINT IN THEIR LIFE, THROUGH CRISIS.
Jon: SO LET'S SAY, WE'LL TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THIS SECRET SERVICE.
YES.
Jon: SITUATION. ALL RIGHT, SO SECRET SERVICE BUSTED IN COLOMBIA. PROSTITUTES IN A ROOM. THEY CALL YOU. WHAT IS YOUR FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE.
THAT IS REALLY BAD.
Jon: YOU WOULD SCOLD THEM.
MY FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE TO ANYBODY IS SU HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH AND FACE IN TO  WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. THERE IS NO WAY FOR THE SECRET SERVICE JUZ YOUR FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE IS  TELL THE TRUTH SO TAVER THEY HANG UP.
I KNOW THAT SAY-- .
Jon: IS THAT REALLY TRUE.
YEAH.
Jon: IS THAT TYPICAL BEHAVIOUR FOR A CRISIS MANAGEMENT, IS A HAND, JUST  TELL THE TRUTH, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE FROM OUR EXPERIENCE IN THESE SITUATIONS, THE TRUTH IS THE  THING THEY'RE TRYING TO BURY IN A HOLE UNDERNEATH, YOU KNOW, A ROOT CELL AR.
RIGHT, WELL LOOK, MY BRAND OF CRIES SIS PROBABLY DIFFERENT FROM MOST. I AM OLD SCHOOL. AND I THINK THAT YOU HAVE GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH. BECAUSE LOOK, EVERYBODY IS-- YOUR PARENTS SAY IT GOING TO COME OUT ANYWAY SO  WHAT IS THE POINT IN HIDING IT. THE OTHER THING I THINK IS REALLY KEY IS THAT LOOK, WHEN PEOPLE SCREW UP, WE ALL DO AND I THINK THAT WHEN WE APOLOGISE AND WE ARE SINCERE  ABOUT IT, THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO GIVE YOU A SECOND CHANCE BUT YOU REALLY CAN'T  BS ABOUT IT, YOU JUST HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT. SO IT'S SIMPLE.
Jon: HAS ANYONE EVER TAKEN THAT ADVICE? (  LAUGHTER  ) BECAUSE I'M THINKING NOW TO  ALL THE SCANDALS AND I AM WONDERING, SO YOUR ADVICE IS TELL THE TRUTH AND THEN  APOLOGIZE IN A SINCERE FASHION AND I'M LIKE, YEAH, I DON'T REMEMBER THAT HAPPENING. I-- SO YOU HAVE NEVER WORKED WITH ANYONE.
NO, LOOK, THERE IS A LOT OF STEPS IN BETWEEN THAT, IN TELLING THE TRUTH AND APOLOGY. YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE FACTS AND SOMETIMES YOU AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE AS SU HAVE  ALL SEEN THE FACTS GET CLOUDED SOMETIMES. IT'S NOT FACTS OF HOW WE WANT THEM TO BE BUT HOW THEY TRULY ARE. AND HOW THEY REALLY ARE. AND SOMETIMES IT TAKE ACE WHILE.
Jon: SO DOW WORK WITH THEM IN TERMS OF COMING TO AN ACCEPTANCE OF THE BAD  PLACE THAT THEY ARE IN. SO THAT THEY CAN GIVE AN HONEST. OR DO YOU WORK WITH THEM IN HERE'S HOW WE CAN, BECAUSE I ALWAYS IMAGINE CRISIS  MANAGER DOES THIS, HERE IS HOW WE CAN MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU ARE FEELING BAD  ABOUT THIS, YOU KNOW, THAT IT'S MORE ABOUT FIXING THE IMAGE OF IT THAN THE SOUL OF IT.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK YOU HAVE TO DO BOTH I MEAN YOU CAN'T COME OUT  AND APOLOGISE. AND NOT MEAN IT BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS SMART. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUY IT YOU'VE SEEN SOME EXAMPLES.
Jon: I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T GET THAT LAST PART.
THEY'RE TO THE GOING TO BUY IT YOU SEE A LAT OF -- DASH LOT OF TIMES WHEN  PEOPLE COME OUT AND THEY HAVE DONE SOMETHING AND PERHAPS THE WIFE IS STANDING  BESIDE THEM AND ARE YOU ALL SAYING OH, YEAH, OKAY, THEY REALLY FORGIVE THAT PERSON.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS, HAVE WE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO BE IN A CRISIS MANAGEMENT  SITUATION WHEN PERHAPS THEY SHOULDN'T? HAVE WE FORCED THESE PUBLIC FIGURES INTO THESE OPEN CONFESSIONS ON TELEVISION  WHEN, IN FACT, IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY ALL RIGHT TO DEMAND IT OR ACCEPT IT?
YEAH, I THINK TWO THINGS. I THINK LOOK AT THE PUBLIC FIGURE. YOU HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF EXPECTATION. AND I THINK THE PUBLIC DEMANDS THAT, YES. BUT I ALSO THINK THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE IS A LINE THAT HAS TO BE DRAWN WHETHER  YOU ARE A PUBLIC FIGURE OR NOT YOU STILL HAVE SOME PRIVACY-- AND I THINK YOU SHOULD MAINTAIN THAT. EVERYTHING IS NOT EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS.
WHEN YOU'RE IN A CRISIS SITUATION AND YOU'RE DEALING  WITH THE MEDIA STORM AND THE VORACIOUS PACK AND SOMEONE WHO MAYBE IS MORALS, WITHOUT  DOW HAVE A HARDER TIME EMPATHIZING WITH IN DO YOU EVER JUST THINK ABOUT IT  LIKE OH, LOOK, THE WOLFS ARE HERE. AND SO SOMEBODY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THROW TO THEM? HOW DO YOU-- HOW DO YOU JUDGE THOSE TWO.
YEAH, LOOK, WITH THE MEDIA WHEN ARE YOU IN A CRISIS IT'S GOING TO BE THERE. IT'S THE NATURE OF THE BEAST. AND WHAT WE REALLY TRY TO DO AS WE'RE NAVIGATING THE CRISIS IS TO BALANCE THE  NEED OF THE CLIENT, ALSO YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC. AND IN THAT WHOLE PROCESS YOU HAVE TO TRY TO PROTECT THE REPUTATION AND THE BRAND. IT'S LIKE A CHESS GAME.
Jon: I JUST RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT BRIAN WILLIAMS OF NBC IS A NEWS ANCHOR, PUNCHED A GIRL SCOUT IN A WHEELCHAIR. (LAUGHTER) PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT.
RIGHT. AND EVERYBODY-- .
Jon: BUT THAT IS COMING OUT. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY UNPROVOKED. I THINK HE DID THIS. WHERE'S MY [BLEEP] THIN MINTS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN.
SO BRIAN NOW IS GOING TO CALL ME.
Jon: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO BRIAN NOW BECAUSE HE HAS DONE THIS TERRIBLE THING AND  IT IS ON CELL PHONE FOOTAGE.
BRIAN, I WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU HAVE DONE THAT TERRIBLE THING, LOOK AT ME NOW, BRIAN, IF YOU HAVE DONE THAT TERRIBLE THING, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING. THAT YOU SOMEHOW LOST YOUR MIND, PERHAPS BECAUSE THE RATINGS WEREN'T EXACTLY AS  THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
Jon: GO TO REHAB, WILLIAMS.
YES.
Jon: GO TO REHAB! GOOD SELF, BAD SELF ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
