MARCH 13, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: HELLO, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART AND WE HAVE A VERY, VERY PLEASANT SHOW FOR YOU THIS EVENING. OUR GUEST, WILL FERRELL WILL BE OUR GUEST, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WOW. WOW. WOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT OLD SHOW MASH. WELL, THAT'S MIKE FARRELL. I APOLOGIZE. OH, REALLY, THAT'S THE SAME JOKE I USED LAST TIME WILL FERRELL WAS HERE? THEY DIDN'T LAUGH AT THAT ONE EITHER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LISTEN. OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, THERE HAS BEEN SOMETHING OF A NATIONAL HULLABALOO, A  COUNTRYWIDE BROUHAHA, AN AMERICAN (MUMBLING), ALL OVER COMMENTS MADE BY RADIO SHOCK-  BLOB RUSH LIMBAUGH.
SANDRA FLUKE SAID THAT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE TO HAVE SEX IN LAW SCHOOL WITHOUT MANDATED  INSURANCE COVERAGE. IT MAKES HER A SLUT, RIGHT? IT MAKES HER A PROSTITUTE.
Jon: SURE. MY GOD. THAT IS THE MOST NOXIOUS, HATEFUL FILTH I'VE HEARD SINCE EARLIER IN HISIN PROGRAM OR THE PROGRAM BEFORE THAT ONE OR  REALLY EVERY SHOW THAT HE'S DONE FOR THE PAST 30 YEARS. BUT THIS TIME, WHETHER BECAUSE THE WOMAN THAT HE ATTACKED IS A PRIVATE CITIZEN OR BECAUSE  THE WORDS CAME IN THE CONTEXT OF ANY WOMAN WHO WISHES CONTRACEPTION TO BE COVERED BY  THEIR INSURANCE PLANS IS A MORAL REPROBATE, PICKING RUSH LIMBAUGH'S POCKET SO THEY CAN  BANG LIKE HORNY BONABOWS, WHICH IS TO SAY, BONABOWS... LET'S FACE IT, THEY'RE ALL PRETTY HORNY. THIS TIME LIMBAUGH'S DAILY NOON TO 3:00 AFTERNOON "MOUTH DUMP" CAUSED OUTRAGE. CREATING-- BY THE WAY, THAT IS THE TITLE OF HIS PROGRAM. "MY DAILY MOUTH DUMP." HE CAUSED PROBLEMS CREATING A LITTLE BIT OF A DILEMMA FOR  THE RIGHT. DID THEY REPUDIATE MR. LIMBAUGH, THEIR LION, THEIR CHAMPION, A MAN REPUBLICANS MADE AN HONORARY MEMBER OF CONGRESS IN 1994, A  MAN THEY'VE CHOSEN TO HONOR WITH A BUST IN THE MISSOURI STATE CAPITAL? THIS MAN.
OUR FRIEND RUSH LIMBAUGH WHO IS SO INVOLVED LEADING THE WAY ON THE CONSERVATIVE CAUSE.
Jon: BY THE WAY THAT IS AN OFFICIAL TRIBUTE TO RUSH LIMBAUGH ON THE HOUSE FLOOR. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED THE DATE ON THAT. IT WAS OCTOBER, 2001. YEAH. MOTHER (BEEP). WEEKS AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS. REREPUDIATE HIM? BUT IF THEY DEFEND HIM THEY RISK THE IRE OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHOSE  HEADS HAVE NOT YET BEEN DITTOED. ALTHOUGH THERE IS A THIRD CHOICE.
PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT WERE GOING, HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. THERE'S A GUY ON THE LEFT, BILL MAHER WHO HOSTS THAT SHOW ON HBO. HE SAYS REALLY REPREHENSIBLE THINGS ABOUT ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE.
HE CALLED GOVERNOR PALIN THE C-WORD AND THE T-WORD.
Jon: WHAT? C AND T? NO, NO. PALIN CAN'T BE BOTH CAPTAIN AND TENILE. ( APPLAUSE ) OH, REALLY? YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY BAD. AND (BEEP). NO, THAT'S BAD. ALL RIGHT. SO I GUESS BY BRINGING UP BILL MAHER, I GUESS BY BRINGING UP BILL MAHER FOX IS SAYING, SO  WE'RE EVEN, RIGHT? OFFSETTING PENALTIES. LET'S JUST SAY WE ALL GET BACK TO WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO AMERICANS, WHETHER OBAMA IS A  SUNNI OR A SHIA. BUT FOX WASN'T DONE.
WHEN THE LIBERALS HIDE BEHIND COMEDY AND SAY, OH, I'M A COMEDIAN, I CAN SAY THESE  HATEFUL AND VILE THINGS.
THIS IS THE HUMOR CARD THAT THEY ALWAYS PLAY AS THEIR LAST RESORT. IT REALLY IS THE ULTIMATE SIGN OF COWARDICE. IF I SAID I'M NOT JUST A COLUMNIST. I'M ALSO A COMEDIAN, PUT A CLOWN NOSE ON, CLOWN SHOES, WOULD THAT BE OKAY? THEY HIDE UNDER THE HELMET OF, OH, I'M A COMEDIAN SO I CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT.
Jon: OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, COMEDIANS DON'T WEAR HELMETS. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE COMEDY, BUT IT IS NOT A HELMETED ART FORM. I THINK YOU MAY HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE X-GAMES. THEY WEAR HELMETS. SECOND OF ALL, HE'S A COMEDIAN WAS YOUR WHOLE DEFENSE ON LIMBAUGH.
LIMBAUGH SAID FRIDAY HE WAS JUST BEING PROVOCATIVE. HIS STOCK AND TRADE.
IF ANYBODY DOESN'T REALIZE THAT WE ARE ILLUSTRATING ABSURDITY HERE BY BEING ABSURD  AND THAT THAT IS THE TRADEMARK OF THIS PROGRAM.
HE'S BEING ABSURD. AN ENTERTAINER CAN BE ABSURD.
Jon: I SEE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HIDE UNDER AN INTEN TANER'S HELMET. COME ON! SEE, HERE'S THE OTHER THING THAT I'M SICK AND TIRED OF ABOUT THIS COMEDIAN THING. NOBODY'S HIDING BEHIND COMEDY. AND THERE ARE REPERCUSSIONS FOR WHAT COMEDIANS SAY. WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT IN A CLUB, THERE ARE REPERCUSSIONS. ASK MICHAEL RICHARDS. ASK TRACY MORGAN. IF YOU DO COMEDY ON TELEVISION, THERE ARE REPERCUSSIONS. ASK ME.
DID JON STEWART MOCK REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HERMAN CAIN BECAUSE  HE'S A BLACK MAN?
Jon: YES. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I MOCKED HIM. BECAUSE HE'S A BLACK MAN. AND IT'S NOT JUST NEWS NETWORKS CALLING YOU RACIST. THAT ARE THE REPERCUSSIONS THAT COMEDIANS FACE AT TIMES. IT'S THE LETTERS THAT THEY GET. MANY OF THEM HANDWRITTEN. SOME OF THEM CONTAINING WHITE POWDER IN THE ENVELOPE. YOU KNOW, WHEN I GOT INTO COMEDY, I DIDN'T THINK THE WHITE POWDER I WOULD BE  GETTING WAS ANTHRAX. BY THE WAY, FOR THOSE OF YOU AT HOME, DON'T SNORT ANTHRAX. SO YOU SEE FEEDBACK AND REPERCUSSIONS COME IN MANY FORMS SO DON'T PRE-PRETEND  THAT BY PEOPLE SAYING BEING COMEDIANS THEY'RE HIDING. THARB NOT. THEY'RE JUST TELLING YOU THAT THE LANGUAGE OF SATIRE IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE  LANGUAGE OF NEWSCASTERS. LANGUAGE IN GENERAL HAS REPERCUSSIONS LIKE WHEN TED NUGENT FACED A NATIONWIDE BOYCOTT FOR THIS.
THAT WAS FRIEND AND FREQUENT GUEST ON THE PROGRAM TED NUGENT.
Jon: RIGHT. TED NUGENT DIDN'T GET BOYCOTTED. THAT WAS THE DIXIE CHICKS FOR SAYING ON STAGE THEY WERE ASHAMED PRESIDENT BUSH WAS  FROM TEXAS BUT THAT MAKES SENSE. NUGENT WAS SENTENCED FOR HIS DIE TRIBE TO HAVING TO JAM CAT SCRATCH FEVER WITH HUCK. I'M NOT SAYING THAT SPEECH SHOULD BE POLICED AND CENSORED AND BOYCOTTED OR PEOPLE DON'T  HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY CRAZY THINGS OR TO BOYCOTT THINGS. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE. I THINK SPEECH SHOULD BE MUCH FREER. BUT HERE'S ONE THING I DO BELIEVE. FOX, SHUT THE (BEEP) UP ABOUT HOW VICTIMIZED YOU AND YOU ALONE ARE. NOBODY CARES. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
