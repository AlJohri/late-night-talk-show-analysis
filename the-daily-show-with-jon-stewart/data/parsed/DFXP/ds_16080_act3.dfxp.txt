Jon: OKAY. SO HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE PROMOTING THIS MOVIE ALL AROUND,,'S GOING  TO KNOW ABOUT IT, GREAT MOVIE, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO HERE, THIS IS WHAT I CALLED THE DOCTOR TODAY, AND HE  SAID THAT YOU CAN DO THIS. HOLD ON, LET'S MOVE THIS OUT, THERE YOU GO. YOU SEE IT. REALLY, THAT GROSSES YOU OUT? YOU JUST SPENT LIKE FIVE HOURS STANDING ON 11th AVENUE IN NEW YORK CITY. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] THERE YOU GO. NOW, YOU SAID FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS STERILIZE IT, SO I'M ASSUMING THAT...
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED HIM AND ASKED HIM BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER HAVE STERILIZE THEM.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
NEVER. WHY WOULD YOU? THEY'RE CLEAN, AREN'T THEY?
Jon: I GUESS TO PREVENT TYPHOID.
OF COURSE YOU STERILIZE THEM. EVERY PROFESSIONAL KNOWS THAT.
Jon: AS YOU'RE DOING THIS...
DO YOU THINK I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE?
Jon: I DO KIND OF THINK YOU'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.
I HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE.
Jon: SO YOU ARE A DOCTOR.
I AM A DOCTOR.
Jon: WAIT, MOVE YOUR HEAD BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO SEE.
OH, SORRY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT WHEN YOU DO IT? TELL ME ABOUT YOUR MOVIE. MOTHER [BLEEPED]! OKAY. ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] THAT WAS A GOOD ONE. THE FIRST ONE IS A GOOD ONE.
DID IT REALLY HURT?
Jon: NEW YORK I WAS JUST KIDDING. I WAS TRYING TO CREATE LIKE DRAMA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
WAIT. HOLD ON A SECOND. WHAT ARE THESE TWEEZERS.
OH, I USE THOSE FOR MY UNIBROW.
HOLD ON. I GOT IT.
Jon: WHY ARE YOUR HANDS SHAKING? OKAY. THAT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD. OKAY. COOL.
THAT'S FIRST ONE.
Jon: THAT'S FIRST ONE.
OKAY. SO ELIZABETH, SHE'S A HORRIBLE PERSON.
Jon: REALLY?
SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ANYBODY BUT HERSELF.
Jon: RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE READY TO COME OUT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. WHO GOT THESE SCISSORS?
Jon: I MADE THEM.
YOU MADE THEM?
Jon: OUT OF A SCHIV I HAD.
THEY SHOULD BE REALLY SUPER POINTY.
Jon: I KNOW.
MY MOUTH IS SALIVATING.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
I'M FROTHING AT THE MOUTH I'M SO EXCITED.
Jon: CAN YOU DO ME FAVOR? CAN YOU NOT DROOL ON MY HAND BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT IS CONSIDERED SANITARY.
I PROMISE I WON'T. THIS IS FROM PRESCHOOL WHEN THEY CUT INTO CARDBOARD, LIKE CONSTRUCTION PAPER. I NEED SOMETHING WITH A POINT FOR GOD'S SAKE. IT'S BLUPTD.
Jon: I DON'T HAVE A SERIES OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS HERE.
WAIT, DIDN'T WE KNOW WE WERE DOING THIS?
Jon: I DIDN'T THINK OF IT.
I WAS SO EXCITED.
Jon: I THOUGHT, WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY IF CAMERON CUT OUT MY  STITCHES, AND CLEARLY I WAS WRONG. [LAUGHTER] SO IS THIS MOVIE...
ARE YOU...
Jon: JUST PULL IT.
I CAN'T PULL IT.
Jon: IT'S NOT COMING. I'LL DO IT.
GET OUT OF HERE. THIS IS NO SCISSOR. THIS SCISSOR ACTUALLY DOESN'T CUT.
Jon: IT'S BLUNT. DIG IT IN THERE. THAT'S THE WAY TO GET IT.
DOES ANYBODY HAVE A PAIR OF SCISSORS ON THEM? NO, NO, NO, DON'T PULL IT.
Jon: THAT'S COMING.
IF YOU DON'T CUT THE OTHER END, YOU'RE GOING TO PULL THE  WHOLE LOOP AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE FLESH.
Jon: ISN'T THIS AWESOME? HEY, CAN I ASK YOU GUYS A QUESTION?
GOT IT. I HAD TO UNKNOT IT WITH IT. HOLD ON. NEXT ONE IS...
Jon: MAAAA.

NO, NO, NO, IT'S GOING TO BE UNTIED.
Jon: YOUR JUST GOING TO UNTIE THEM.

Jon: JUST REOPEN THE WOUND.
NOT YET. OH, I GOT IT.
Jon: OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.
Jon: THAT'S... OKAY. YEAH, THAT'S NICE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S NICE ABOUT THAT? THAT ONE ACTUALLY REALLY HURT.
DID IT REALLY?
Jon: A LITTLE BIT. LET ME CUT THE TOP OFF AND THEN YOU CAN PULL THEM OUT. SO WAIT. TELL ME ABOUT THIS MOVIE, AND WHY IT WAS...
