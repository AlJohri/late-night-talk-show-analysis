(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER F.B.I. SPECIAL AGENT. HIS BOOK IS CALLED "THE BLACK BANNERS: THE INSIDE STORY OF 9/11 AND THE WAR AGAINST AL  QAEDA." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ALI SOUFAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE BLACK BANNER."  NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT... I WANT TO TALK TO YOU MORE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. TEN YEARS AGO THE IDEA WAS THE NEW THREAT IS STATE... NONSTATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM. IT APPEARS NOW WE'RE ENTERING A PHASE WHEN IRAN AND SYRIA AND  ISRAEL ARE ABOUT TO... I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TECHNICAL TERM IS IN COUNTERTERRORISM. THROW DOWN. (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU GETTING THE SENSE AS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT WHAT'S  HAPPENING ON THE GROUND IN THESE PLACES?
IT SEEMS LIKE IT. IT SEEMS THAT IRAN IS NOW USING NON-STATE ACTORS TO, AGAIN, THROW OUT THE POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND IN THE REGION. JUST TODAY, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WAS AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON TWO ISRAELI DIPLOMATS, ONE IN  GEORGIA AND ONE IN INDIA. AND THAT COMES ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE TERRORIST LEADER FROM HAZARD.
Jon: BUT ALSO...
HEZBOLLAH.
Jon: IRANIAN SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN TARGETED AS WELL. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS JOCKEYING IN THIS PROXY WAR.
ABSOLUTELY. AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT POSSIBLY THE ISRAELIS ARE BEHIND THE ATTACK  ON THE SCIENTISTS BUT THE SITUATION IS WAY MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES HAPPENING INSIDE IRAN. IRAN IS NOT A MONOLITHIC SOCIETY. YES IT'S KNOWN TO BE A PERSIAN CHAUVINISTIC SOCIETY.
Jon: HE SAID THAT, I DIDN'T THEY! HE SAID THAT! I WAS JUST SITTING HERE. (LAUGHTER)
ABOUT 61% OF THE IRANIANS ARE PERSIANS. BUT THERE'S UP TO SOME NUMBERS PUT THEM AT 40% THAT ARE TURKIC PEOPLE. AND HISTORICALLY THE PERSIANS AND THE TURKS DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER. ALSO YOU HAVE THE ARAB MINORITY AND ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO OPPOSE THE PERSIAN  DOMINATION OF IRAN.ï¿½r
THE AS JANUARYIAN, THE TURKISH PEOPLE IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT IRAN  AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE THE TWO BIG PLAYERS. WHAT'S TURKEY'S ROLE IN ALL OF THIS AND IS IRAN NERVOUS ABOUT YOU ARE THE ECONOMY? I WOULD THINK THAT THE AZERBAIJANIAN POPULATION WOULD HAVE SYMPATHY TOWARD TURKEY.
WE SEE AN INCREASED ROLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WE SEE IN THE SYRIA, WE SEE IN THE CENTRAL ASIA AND THAT'S  WHAT'S SCARING IRAN BECAUSE IRAN IS SURROUNDED WITH MANY DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES. MOST OF THEM ARE TURKIC AND ANY RISE IN ETHNIC NATIONALISM IN CENTRAL ASIA IS GOING TO BE  CONSIDERED AS A SIGNIFICANT BLOW TO IRANIAN INFLUENCE IN THE REGION. FOR EXAMPLE AZERBAIJAN IS MOSTLY SHI'A. SHI'A MUSLIM. IRAN IS 90% SEE YA. IRAN CLAIMS THAT THEY ARE THE PROTECTORS OF SHI'A AROUND THE WORLD. THERE IS A WAR THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE '90s BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN, SHI'A MUSLIM COUNTRY, NEIGHBOR OF IRAN AND BETWEEN ARMENIA, AN ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN COUNTRY OVER  A REGION. DURING THAT WAR IRAN SUPPORTED ARMENIA AGAINST SHIITE AZERBAIJAN.
Jon: WHY?
BECAUSE, AGAIN 40,% OF THE IRANIAN POPULATION ARE ARAB AND IN CASE OF AZERBAIJAN WINNING A  WAR AND AZERBAIJAN IS A TURKIC COUNTRY AND THEY HAVE A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH TURKEY THEY  FEEL THEY'RE GOING TO BE SURROUNDED.
Jon: HOW DID THIS WAR GET SNUCK BY US? I DON'T REMEMBER THIS WAR. DO THEY NOT TELL US ABOUT WARS UNLESS WE'RE DOING THE BOMBING? DO WE NOT HEAR ABOUT THESE OTHER WARS?
I THINK THIS REGION WAS.
Jon: WELL, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY. WHEN YOU SAID THAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY GOD GUESS THERE YOU BUT I DIDN'T. I HELD BACK. THE SITUATION IN SYRIA NOW IS WHAT'S PERPLEXING ME. IF THE U.N. CAN'T FORMULATE A RESOLUTION TO CONDEMN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SYRIA, IS... THEN  THEY ARE BASICALLY... IT'S LIKE NOT FORMULATE AGO RESOLUTION THAT CAPE UPTON IS KIND OF HOT. (LAUGHTER) IT'S OBVIOUS. HOW DID CHINA AND... HOW DID THAT...
RUSSIA.
Jon: HOW DID CHINA AND RUSSIA BLOCK THAT? AND WHY?
WELL RUSSIA HAS HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH SYRIA. NOT JUST WITH BASHAR ASSAD BUT ALSO HIS FATHER HAFEZ. AND CHINA HAS BEEN RUSSIA'S TOOL LET'S CALL IT, IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BUT THE INTERESTING PART IS THE ROLE OF CHINA AND WHY CHINA DID THE VETO AND RUSSIA IS ALREADY  DOING IT. CHINA NEVER DID VETOES BEFORE EXCEPT IF IT'S CONNECTED TO THEIR OWN BACKYARD, LIKE NORTH  KOREA, FOR EXAMPLE.ï¿½ï¿½ SO I THINK CHINA WAS SENDING A STRONG MESSAGE THAT THE  SITUATION IN SYRIA IS PART OF THEIR OWN NATIONAL INTEREST. AND THE REASON IT'S PART OF THEIR OWN NATIONAL INTEREST IS, AGAIN, ROLE T ROLE OF TURKEY. REMEMBER, TURKEY IS A NATO COUNTRY AND RUSSIA IS SURROUNDED. RUSSIA IS ALREADY ANXIOUS ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF NATO IN EASTERN EUROPE. SO NOW WE SEE TURKEY'S INFLUENCE IN THE REGION COMING IN THE POSSIBILITY OF ETHNIC  NATIONALISM PROBABLY COMING IN COUNTRIES LIKE AZERBAIJAN, COUNTRIES LIKE UZBEKISTAN.
Jon: I CAN SEE RUSSIA BUT CHINA AS WELL?
CHINA HAS A LOT OF UIGHUR POPULATIONS. THE MUSLIM POPULATION IN CHINA THAT'S OPPOSING AND THEY WANT THEIR OWN... THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE. THOSE PEOPLE ARE ALSO TURKIC PEOPLE. AND YOU'RE DEALING WITH AN AREA....
Jon: TURKEY! (LAUGHTER) SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT? IT'S THE NEW POWER STRUGGLE?
EXACTLY. AND RUSSIA IS... SORRY, TURKEY IS A NATO COUNTRY SO RUSSIA AND CHINA AND THERE'S A LOT OF  RESOURCES IN CENTRAL ASIA AND IF PROBLEMS START HAPPENING AMONG TURKIC ETHNIC PEOPLE IN THE  REGION IT MIGHT, AFFECT THE INFLUENCE OF CHINA.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION. IT'S INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND SOMETHING WE DON'T HEAR THAT MUCH IN THE STATES BECAUSE ON  OUR MAGAZINES WE'RE CONCERNED WITH IF PETS ARE GOOD COMPANIONS THAT KIND OF THING. (LAUGHTER) "THE BLACK BANNER" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. WILL YOU COME BACK AND KEEP THE DIALOGUE GOING? WE'D APPRECIATE IT.
