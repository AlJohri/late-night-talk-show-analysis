Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. IT IS THE SECOND ACT OF OUR PROGRAM. SO OF COURSE IT'S TIME ONCE AGAIN TO PLAY EVERYONE'S FAVORITE NEW GAME. WHERE IN THE WORLD IS ANTHONY WEINER'S PENIS.
TMZ OBJECTED PHOTOGRAPHS HE APPARENTLY SHOT OF HIMSELF IN THE MEMBER'S ONLY  HOUSE GYM. THEY APPEAR TO BE SHOT WITH HIS BLACKBERRY WHILE HE POSED IN FRONT OF A MIRROR. SENT TO AT LEAST ONE WOMAN OVER THE INTERNET.
Jon: HIS PENIS WENT TO THE GYM. HOW EXCITING. NOT THAT IT NEEDED A WORKOUT. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE. OH S THAT-- REALLY, THAT'S THE PICTURE? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO THE NEWEST WORK IN WEINER'S SELF-PORTRAIT, HIS BLACKBERRY SNAPSHOT HIGHLIGHTING THE SMOOTHNESS OF HIS ODD HAIRLESS FORM IN  THE CONGRESSIONAL GYMNASIUM. AT LEAST AT MYTH THIS HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO INTO WORK LAST WEEK. THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WAS IN RECESS. OF COURSE NOW IT'S THIS WEEK.
MEANWHILE HE AVOIDS A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE RETURN TO CAPITOL HILL BY TAKING WHAT  HE IS CALLING A SHORT LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
WEINER SAYS HE WILL RECEIVE PROFESSIONAL TREATMENT DURING HIS TIME AWAY. HE WAS NOT VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE NEEDS HELP FOR.
Jon: REALLY? (LAUGHTER) NOT VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE NEEDS HELP FOR. CAN WE SEE THE PICTURE AGAIN PLEASE? I'M GOING TO GO WITH ALLOW PIECIA. -- ALOPECIA. THE DUDE HAS GOT NO HAIR ANYWHERE. HE'S LIKE A JEWISH BARBIE DOLL. NEW YORKERS HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE BEING REPRESENTED BY POWDER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SERIOUSLY, MAN, JEWS, WE'RE JEWS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR PUBIC HAIR IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE EWOKS SHOULD BE IN THERE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S RIGHT. THE FOLIAGE IN MY PUBIC HAIR IS LIKE THE PLANET ENDORE, THAT IS WHAT I'M SUGGESTING. OBVIOUSLY REPUBLICANS ARE BULGING OVER WEINER'S TROUBLES BUT-- WHAT ABOUT  THE FELLOW DEMOCRATS?
NANCY PELOSI ISSUED A STATEMENT CALLING ON WEINER TO SEEK TREATMENT AND RESIGN. QUOTE I URGE CONGRESSMAN WEINER TO SEEK THAT HELP WITHOUT THE PRESSURES OF  BEING A MEMBER OF CONGRESS.
I DON'T SEE HOW CAN PROCEED AND EFFECTIVELY REPRESENT HIS CONSTITUENTS.
Jon: REALLY, YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO REPRESENT HIS CONSTITUENCY. PICTURES OF HIMSELF AT THE GYM, THE MAIN EXPORT. NOW BY THE WAY, I KNOW HE IS LIKE FROM JERSEY. NO ONE IN WASHINGTON STEP IN TO DEFEND THIS EMBATTLED ELECTED OFFICIAL. WILL ANYONE? ANYONE-- OH MY GOD! IT'S CHARLIE RANGEL, THE SAME CONGRESSMAN CONVICTED OF 11 ETHICS CHARGES IN 2010  AND STILL GOT RE-ELECTED TO HIS 21st TERM.
HE WASN'T GOING WITH PROSTITUTES. HE WASN'T GOING OUT WITH LITTLE BOYS. HE WASN'T GOING INTO MEN'S ROOM WITH BROAD STANCES.
Jon: I MEAN YOU SHOULD SEE SOME OF THE [BLEEP] I'VE DONE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: FORGET-- FORGET ABOUT THE TAX PROBLEMS AND THE-- I WANT [BLEEP] A  PENGUIN ON TIP O'NEILL'S DESK. TRUE. TRUE STORY. AND I'M STILL HERE. LIKE GUM ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SHOE. YOU'LL NEVER GET RID OF ME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BY THE WAY, A SHOE THAT I HAVE HAD SEX WITH. BY THE WAY, CHARLIE RANGEL MAY BE THE ONLY CONGRESSMAN WHO SAID I CONDITION NOT SAY  WITH CERTITUDE THAT THAT IS MY PENIS, I WOULD BELIEVE HIM. IS IT--  (APPLAUSE)
Jon: IS IT MY PENIS OR IS IT MY BUTTOCKS. OR IS IT A PICTURE OF SOME TYPE OF PENIS BUTTOCKS HYBRID. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: MEANWHILE OUTSIDE CONGRESSMAN WEINER'S OFFICE HIS CONSTITUENTS CALMLY  DELATE -- DEBATED THE MERITS OF THEIR CONGRESSMAN TO STAY IN OFFICE.
HOW DO I KNOW --
EVERYBODY IS RIGHT AT SOME POINT-- EVERYBODY LIED AT SOME POINT.
Jon: EVERYBODY'S LIED AT SOME POINT. FROM HIS SUPPORTERS. THIS IS THE KIND OF ETHICAL LEVEL WE NOW DEMAND FROM OUR LEADERS. HEY, LOOK, THEY'RE ALL  [BLEEP]-- BAGS, RIGHT?
