THAT'S TRUE.
Jon: WHAT DID THEY SAY-- BECAUSE I GREW A BEARD AWHILE BACK. AND THE CROWD HATED IT. BUT --
I DON'T REMEMBER YOU WITH A BEARD ON THE SHOW.
Jon: IT WAS THE FRONT PART OF THE BEARD, THE GOATEE. AND MY DAUGHTER SAID TO ME ONE NIGHT, DADDY, YOUR KISSES FEEL LIKE PUNISHMENT. AND THEN I THOUGHT--  (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS NOW.
WHAT'S THE ROLE YOU WERE SHAVING IT FOR.
I DID A SCIENCE FICTION MOVE YEE WITH NEIL-- THE GUY WITHOUT DIRECTED DISTRICT  NINE SO THAT WILL COME OUT IN 2015.

THEY HAVE TO BE. VERY RARELY IS SOMEONE A HERO OF THE FUTURE HAVE LIKE A PONYTAIL.
NO, AND LIKE A-- FUTURE WE ALL SHAVE OUR HEADS.
Jon: VERY INTERESTING. THIS, THE ZOO, YOU BOUGHT A ZOO. (LAUGHTER) OBVIOUSLY I'VE SEEN THE MOVIE. AND IF I MAY, JUST A QUICK SYNOPSIS WITHOUT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY, YOU PAID MONEY FOR A ZOO.

RIGHT, IN THE FILM AND OBVIOUSLY IT ENDS WITH OKAY, EVERYBODY. SEE YOU TOMORROW.
WE DID IT.
Jon: WE DID IT, WE GOT OUR ZOO. WHAT IS THE SITUATION HERE, AND ARE THOSE ACTUAL ANIMALS OR CGI.
THOSE ARE REAL ANIMALS. IT-- THE FILM IS DIRECTED BY CAMERON CROWE WHO IS GREAT. HE DID "JERRY MAGUIRE" AND ALMOST FAMOUS AND SAY ANYTHING. AND MANY OTHERS. AND SO WHENEVER I WAS PITCHED THE MOVIE I WOULD SAY WELL IT'S ABOUT THIS  FAMILY, IT'S THIS GUY AND HE LOST HIS WIFE AND HE'S GOT THESE TWO KIDS. AND THEY BUY A BROKEN DOWN ZOO AND THROUGH THE COURSE OF KIND OF FIXING THE ZOO UP, THEY ACTUALLY FIX THE FAMILY UP-- .
Jon: I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE, ALL RIGHT BECAUSE --
AND THEN I THINK CAMERON CROWE DIRECTED IT AND PEOPLE GO [BLEEP] WHY DIDN'T YOU  TELL ME THAT TO BEGIN WITH.
Jon: WHAT ANIMAL SURPRISED YOU, WAS ANYBODY PERSONALITY, DID YOU MEET AN  ANIMAL AND THINK I DID NOT THINK I WAS GOING TO ENJOY THAT TYPE OF ANIMAL'S  COMPANY, YET I FIND MYSELF THINKING HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, EMUS, THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.
THE GRIZZLY BEAR WAS THE MOST -- THE GRIZZLY BEAR, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A GRIZZLY BEAR.
Jon: WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME, I LIVE IN NEW YORK, OF COURSE. THERE'S ONE THAT OWNS A DELI NEAR MY HOUSE. I GO THERE ALL THE TIME.
NO I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE UP CLOSE.
Jon: HOW BIG IS A GRIZZLY BEAR.
WHEN HE STOOT UP HE WAS 12 AND A HALF FEET TALL. AND THE ONLY THING I KNEW ABOUT GRIZZLY BEARS WAS THE STORY, MY FATHER HAD TOLD MOW A STORY. HE HAD TAKEN A FISHING TRIP IN 1986, SO HE AND HIS FRIENDS WENT TO ALASKA, AND  THIS GUY TOOK THEM AROUND AND THE GUIDE HAD A 44 MAGNUM IN A HOLSTER. AND MY DAD LOOKED AT IT AND HE NOTICED THAT THE SIGHT WAS FILED DOWN. AND HE SAID I CAN ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THE GUN. AND THE GUY GOES GOES YEAH, SURE. IS THAT FOR GRIZZLY BEARS. AND GUY GOES YEAH, AND HE GOES WHY DID YOU FILE THE SIGHT DOWN.
AND THE GUY GOES OH, YEAH, RIGHT, THAT'S SO THAT AFTER I SHOOT THE GRIZZLY BEAR IT DOESN'T HURT SO MUCH WHEN HE  SHOVES THE GUN UP MY ASS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. FAMILY FRIENDLY ENTERTAINMENT. WE BOUGHT A ZOO T IS IN THEATRES ON DECEMBER 23rd. AND OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT GIVING IT A-- AWAY T THERE IS SOME ZOO RELATED-- THAT GOES ON.
CAMERON CROWE DIRECTED IT.
