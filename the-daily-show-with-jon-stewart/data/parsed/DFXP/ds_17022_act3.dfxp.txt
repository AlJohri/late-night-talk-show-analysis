(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE WAS A CAPTAIN IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY. HE WAS AN ASTRONAUT. HIS NEW BOOK WHICH HE COWROTE WITH HIS WIFE ARIZONA CONGRESSWOMAN GABRIELLE GIFFORDS  IS CALLED "GABBY, A STORY OF COURAGE AND HOPE." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MARK KELLY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO NICE TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
GREAT TO BE HERE.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED "GABBY, A STORY OF COURAGE AND HOPE."  I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I'M READING THE BOOK AND THE TEMPTATION IS, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE AN ASTRONAUT WHO MARRIES A CONGRESSWOMAN. THE TEMPTATION IS TO SKIP THE ROUGH PARTS, THE TRAGEDY, AND READ IT AS A FAIRY TALE. BECAUSE IT IS IN SOME RESPECTS A REMARKABLE LOVE STORY BETWEEN TWO EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE.
WELL, THANK YOU. BUT WE TRIED TO INCLUDE ALL THE PARTS SO... YOU KNOW, I THINK GABBY'S HAPPY WITH HOW IT CAME  OUT AND IT'S... YOU KNOW, WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE BOOK.
Jon: IS IT THERAPEUTIC TO WRITE THIS AFTER HAVING GONE THROUGH WHAT YOU GUYS WENT  THROUGH OVER THE PAST YEAR?
IT IS. IT'S SOMETIMES HARD, THOUGH. YOU KNOW, WE... ESPECIALLY ON THE WEEKENDS WHEN I'D SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH HER GOING OVER  IT, IT'S HARD TO RELIVE SOME OF THE STUFF, SOME OF THE PARTS. WE'D SOMETIMES HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK FROM IT. BUT I THINK THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH OF US WAS GENERALLY PRETTY POSITIVE.
Jon: I SAW SOME OF THE FOOTAGE, THE INTERVIEW WITH DIANE SAWYER, THE... YOU  RECORDED AN AWFUL LOT OF WHERE SHE'S COME SINCE JANUARY UNTIL NOW. IT'S KIND OF... IT'S AMAZING. YOU FORGET THE TRAUMA WAS SO GREAT. IT'S REMARKABLE SHE'S ALIVE.
I THINK WITHOUT THE VIDEO IN THE BEGINNING SOME PEOPLE  WOULDN'T REALIZE WHAT THAT WHOLE JOURNEY WOULD BE LIKE. WE TALK ABOUT IN THE THE BOOK. BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO SEE IT. IT WASN'T PLANNED I JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS THAT AT SOME  POINT SHE'S GOING TO WANT TO SEE IT, NEVER THINKING WE MIGHT USE IT ON T.V.
Jon: THIS IS GOING TO SOUND LIKE A STRANGE OBSERVATION BUT IN READING IT, THERE WAS ONE  PART IN THERE THAT REALLY STRUCK ME AND IT'S SUCH A SMALL THING. YOU SAID THAT IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP SHE SPOKE 70% OF THE TIME.
AT LEAST. I MEAN, SHE WAS A REAL TALKER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO ONCE THE ACCIDENT... YOU REALLY HAD TO DO-- ESPECIALLY IN THE  BEGINNING-- 100%, 95% OF THE TALKING. I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE REALIZE, LIKE EVEN THAT, WHAT A DRASTIC CHANGE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP.
BIG CHANGE. IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS 100%, FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND EVERYBODY AROUND HER AND SHE WAS SUCH A TALKATIVE PERSON AND  INQUISITIVE, AND SHE STILL IS. THE DIFFERENCE IS NOW I'M... EVEN TODAY I'M CARRYING MOST OF THE CONVERSATION. IT'S CHANGING ON A WEEKLY BASIS. SHE'S GETTING BET WE ARE THAT, BUT IT WAS A BIG CHANGE FOR US.
Jon: HOW DID... I'M READING THE THIS STORY. YOU'RE A KID FROM NEW JERSEY-- SUCH AS MYSELF-- THE SAME SIZE... (LAUGHTER). AND YET YOU END UP IN SPACE MARRIED TO A CONGRESSWOMAN. (LAUGHTER)
A JEWISH CONGRESSWOMAN.
Jon: AND I'M MARRIED TO A CATHOLIC WOMAN AND I'VE NEVER LEFT THE TRISTATE AREA. (APPLAUSE) SO REALLY SHOULDN'T WE BE MORE... WE'RE COMPADRES. I WOULD SAY TWIN SONS BUT OFF TWIN BROTHER WHO HAS ALSO BEEN THE TO SPACE.
I THINK YOU COULD PROBABLY DO MY JOB BUT I DON'T THINK I'D  HAVE IT... I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SIT THERE AND DO WHAT YOU DO.
Jon: MARK, THERE IS NO WAY I CAN DO YOUR JOB. (LAUGHTER) THERE IS GOOD STUFF IN HERE, TOO, ABOUT THE PRESSURES... YOU KNOW, YOU FLEW YOUR FINAL MISSION AND THE FINAL SHUTTLE  MISSION WHILE YOU WERE ALSO FEELING VERY RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF GABBY'S RECOVERY. HOW DIFFICULT WAS THAT DECISION TO MAKE?
IT WAS REALLY HARD. I WANTED HER TO BE MORE OF A PART OF THE DECISION WHEN WE MADE IT BUT SHE WASN'T REALLY  ABLE TO EXPRESS HERSELF THAT WELL THEN SO I JUST KIND OF TOOK A LEAP OF FAITH. NOW, I DO KNOW HER REALLY WELL AND I KNEW ONE THING I WASN'T GOING TO DO IS HEAR FOR THE REST  OF MY LIFE "HOW DID YOU GIVE THAT UP BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?"  AND SO SHE'S VERY... VERY HAPPY WITH THE DECISION. IT'S REMARKABLE HOW THE TWO OF YOU PUSH EACH OTHER VERY WELL, URGE EACH OTHER ON, MOTIVATE EACH OTHER. BACK IN THE DAY SHE'S TRYING TO MOTIVATE YOU TO MOVE ON FROM MAYBE JOINING... BECOMING AN  ADMIRAL AND GOING TO THE JOINT CHIEFS AND NOW WITH HER RECOVERY  YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING TO HER "NOT GOOD ENOUGH, FORM A WORD, WHAT WORD IS THAT? KEEP GOING, GABBY." THE TWO OF YOU... DID YOU ALWAYS HAVE A RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS... YOU COULD MOTIVATE EACH OTHER VERY WELL?
I THINK SO. WE ALWAYS COMPLEMENTED EACH OTHER PRETTY WELL. SHE WAS ALWAYS A BIG FAN OF MY MILITARY SERVICE AND MY CAREER AND ALWAYS TRIED TO PUSH ME  ALONG WITH THAT AND NOW... TODAY IN THE SITUATION WE'RE IN I'M DOING A LOT MORE OF THE  ENCOURAGING BUT I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO GET PROBABLY BACK TO MORE OF A BALANCE EVENTUALLY. LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.
Jon: DO YOU THINK IN HER MIND, ARE HER THOUGHTS MORE SOPHISTICATED TAN HER ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE? IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DISERN?
ABSOLUTELY. HER COGNITION AND HER ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING AND UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE SAY  AND... A COUPLE PEOPLE ASKED ME THIS WEEK BEING UP HERE WOULD SHE RECOGNIZE ME. WELL, OF COURSE. I MEAN, IF SHE KNEW YOU BEFORE, SHE'S GOING TO KNOW YOU NOW JUST THE SAME AS ALWAYS. SO THOSE THINGS HAVEN'T CHANGED. IT'S JUST THE COMMUNICATION SHE STRUGGLES WITH. BUT IT'S... YOU KNOW, LEAPS AND BOUNDS EVERY WEEK.
Jon: AND HOW ARE HER DOCTORS FEELING ABOUT ALL THAT? SHE'S NOW MUCH MORE AN OUTPATIENT BUT STILL DOING THERAPY. SHE PASSED UP... SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, HAD TO FLY BACK FOR REHAB. SHE STILL STICKS TO THAT SCHEDULE.
SHE DOESN'T MISS MANY DAYS OF THERAPY NOW. WITH THE SHOW ON TONIGHT SHE MAY HAVE TO TAKE A DAY OFF TOMORROW SO SHE CAN WATCH YOUR SHOW. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO WATCH THE SHOW AND MISS REHAB.
THE HIGHLIGHT OF HER DAY.
Jon: TO WATCH YOU ON THIS SHOW?
NO, TO WATCH YOU, WATCH "THE DAILY SHOW." SHE WATCHES VERY... ON THE  WEEKENDS SHE WATCHES THE NEWS PROGRAMS BUT DURING THE WEEK AFTER DINNER SHE WATCHES "THE  DAILY SHOW" FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) SNEUL REAPLY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: I'M GOING TO HAVE DO A BETTER JOB! (LAUGHS) NOW THAT I KNOW IMPORTANT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING I HAVE TO TRY A LITTLE HARDER. NOW WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU'RE A GUY. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN RUNNING AROUND. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO NEXT?
WELL, THE BIGGEST THING I WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT SHE HAS EVERYTHING SHE NEEDS TO GET BETTER. SHE WANTS TO GET BACK TO SOUTHERN ARIZONA, SERVE HER CON ONSTITUENTS, GET BACK TOC CONGRESS. SHE'S GOING TO MAKE THIS DECISION ON HER OWN TERMS WHEN SHE'S READY TO MAKE THE DECISION  AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. BUT I THEME TO SUPPORT HER FOR NOW.
Jon: WOW. IT'S AN INCREDIBLY MOVING AND WONDERFUL STORY AND I WISH THE TWO OF YOU THE GREATEST SUCCESS. SO NICE TO SEE YOU. AND PLEASE WISH HER WELL FOR ME. OH, I'LL JUST SAY IT MYSELF SINCE I KNOW SHE'S WATCHING. DOES SHE FAST FORWARD THROUGH THE COMMERCIALS?
Jon: I WAS DOING THAT SO SHE'S PROBABLY GOING TO DO IT TONIGHT.
Jon: ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW, MARK KELLY.
