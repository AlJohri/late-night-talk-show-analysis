Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, THE SHOW TONIGHT, IT'S GOING TO BE VERY NICE. TENACIOUS D WILL ROCK YOU TONIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE. BUT OF COURSE, THE MAIN STORY TONIGHT, THE SUPREME COURT'S RULE ON THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AKA OBAMACARE. YES, THIS MORNING ALL AMERICANS, INDEED, ALL CITIZENS OF THE WORLD GATHERED TOGETHER TO SEE  WHAT OUR NATION'S HIGHEST COURT WOULD SAY WITHOUT CON SEB DIFFICULTS RULE THE DAY  OR LIBERALS REIGN GRANTING THE GOVERNMENT POWER TO KEEP OLD PEOPLE ALIVE  ARTIFICIALLY SO THAT WE MAY HARVEST THEIR ORGANS. (LAUGHTER) THAT IS EXACTLY THE QUESTION THE COURTS FACED. AND THEN SUDDENLY, AT THE EXACT TIME WE HAD BEEN TOLD THE DAY BEFORE THE DECISION  WOULD BE HANDED DOWN, PANDEMONIUM!
THIS IS CNN'S BREAKING NEWS.
Jon: THE RACE WAS ON. WHICH NEWS ORGANIZATION WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK OF THE GREAT DECISION. WHO WOULD EMERGE FROM THE CHAOS AS TODAY'S GRAND CHAMPION OF NEWS FIRSTINESS!
I WANT TO BRINGING YOU THE BREAK NUGS THAT ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE BILL  MEERS THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS NOT A VALID EXERCISE OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE.
IT WOULD APPEAR AS IF THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES HAVE STRUCK DOWN THE INDIVIDUAL  MANDATE, THE CENTER PIECE PIECE OF THE HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION.
WE HAVE BREAK NEWS HERE ON THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL. THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE HAS BEEN RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AT 10:07 A.M. EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME IN A PHOTO FINISH RESPONSE NEWS, CNN BY 8 SECONDS WAS THE VERY FIRST ORGANIZATION TO REPORT THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF  OBAMA'S SIGNATURE HEALTH CARE ACT.
WOW, THAT'S A DRAMATIC MOMENT.
Jon: YES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YES. A MOMENT OF GREAT DRAMA. AND LIKE MANY OF OUR GREATEST DRAMAS, A WORK OF COMPLETE FICTION. (LAUGHTER)
WE'RE GETTING CONFLICTING INFORMATION. AS WE FOLLOW, GO TO-- WHICH COVERS THE HIGH COURT.
CORRECT.
THEY SAY THAT DESPITE WHAT SHANON JUST READ, THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS  SURVIVING AS A TAX.
Jon: BOOM! FOX NEWS MEGAN KELLY CATCHES THE MISTAKE NOT TWO MINUTES LATER BY A BLOG. BUT CNN, OH, CNNPAUVRECNN THEY WEPT NOT ONE MINUTE, NOT TWO MINUTES-- 7 FULL MINUTES OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE HYPERVENTILATION.
THE COURT STRIKING DOWN THAT MANDATE IS A DRAMATIC BLOW FOR THE POLICY AND TO  THE PRESIDENT. THE JUSTICES HAVE JUST GUTTED, WOLF, THE CENTER PIECE PROVISION OF THE OBAMA HEALTH CARE LAW.
IT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THE HEALTH-CARE REFORM LAW.
THE DIRECT BLOW TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, A DIRECT BLOW TO HIS  DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
Jon: YES, HOW WILL THE ADMINISTRATION RECOVER. (LAUGHTER) AFTER THIS INCREDIBLY PUBLIC BLOW TO THEIR CREDIBILITY. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THE ADMINISTRATION-- THE ADMINISTRATION STAKED THEIR ENTIRE REPUTATION ON THIS  IMPORTANT MOMENT. AND NOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS OUT THERE, THE FACE OF THIS GIANT [BLEEP] UP. (LAUGHTER) SURE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THE ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO ADD CNN.
WE'RE GETTING WIDELY DIFFERENT ASSESSMENTS OF WHAT THE UNITED STATES  SUPREME COURT HAS DECIDED.
Jon: YEAH, WIDELY DIFFERENT. THERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING. (LAUGHTER) AND THEN THERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. (LAUGHTER) NO SIM PATHRY, CNN! YOU HAVE BEEN DRIVING US NUTS WITH [BLEEP] FOR MONTHS. OH, THE RULING IS GOING TO COME, IT WAS LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING FOR YOU GUYS. YOU WERE BUGGING EVERYBODY, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO GET, IS IT IN THERE? CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS, WHAT IS IT, CAN I SHAKE IT. THEN YOU RUN DOWNSTAIRS AND YOUR PARENTS ARE LIKE SLOW DOWN THERE, ACE, WE GOT ALL  DAY BUT YOU CAN'T [BLEEP] YOURSELF, YOU CAN! (LAUGHTER) YOU SEE THE PRESENT WITH YOUR NAME ON IT UNDER THE TREE AND YOU JUST CAN'T-- I  JUST GOING TO -- -- HUH? (LAUGHTER) YOU GOT ME JUST RED GUNK AND FEATHERS AND I'M LIKE IT WAS A PARROT YOU [BLEEP]! (APPLAUSE) I'M SORRY MR. CRACKERS. IT'S ONE OF MY EARLIEST CHILDHOOD MEMORIES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, NO, SETTLE DOWN. WELL, BY A 5-4 DECISION WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WAS CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS JOINED  THE LIBERAL JUSTICES AND WROTE THE MAJORITY OPINION THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE  DEEMED UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER  BECAUSE THE DECISION YUN HELD THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AS WITHIN CONGRESS'S POWER TO LEVY TAXES. IT WAS VERY CONFUSING, UNLESS YOU READ OBVIOUSLY UP TO PAGE FOUR. HOW EXCITED WAS THE PRESIDENT? WELL, HE STROLLED DOWN I KILLED BIN LADEN LANE TO HIS--  (LAUGHTER) YOU HEARD ME, I KILLED BIN  LADEN, MOTHER [BLEEP], AND ADDRESSED THE NATION.
I KNOW THERE WILL BE A LOT OF DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT THE POLITICS OF ALL  THIS, ABOUT WHO WON AND WHO LOST. BUT THAT DISCUSSION COMPLETELY MISSES THE POINT.
Jon: WHICH IS, THAT I WON. (LAUGHTER) NOT THAT WHAT MATTERS IS WHO WON, BUT IT WAS ME. (LAUGHTER) SO THE REAL QUESTION TONIGHT, HOW DOES IT TASTE [BLEEP]? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE WAS PRETTY EXCITED. ONE SMALL ISSUE, ONE SMALL ISSUE, OBAMA HAD IN THE PAST BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT  THIS INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS NOT.
FOR US TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE GOT TO TAKE A RESPONSIBILITY TO GET HEALTH  INSURANCE IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A TAX INCREASE.
YOU REJECT THAT --
I ABSOLUTELY REJECT THAT NOTION.
Jon: OF COURSE YOU REJECT IT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A RE-ELECTION. BUT THE SUPREME COURT USING THE PRECEDENT SET IN A LANDMARK CASE OF PEEING ON  MY LEG VTELLING ME IT'S RAINING--  (LAUGHTER) IS ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT THINGS ACTUALLY ARE. THE SUPREME COURT'S WORDING DID TO THE GO UNNOTICED.
A VICTORY FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION MEANS A MIDDLE CLASS TAX INCREASE  AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS.
THIS LAW IS A TAX. THE BILL WAS SOLD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON A DECEPTION.
IT'S A TAX.
IT'S A TAX.
IT'S A TAX.
IT'S A TAX.
TAX. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: SENATOR IS RIGHTS, IT'S A TAX. THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW DOES WILLFORD BRIMLINGTON ROMNEY HANDLE THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT.
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'LL KEEP IN PLACE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KEEP THEIR CURRENT INSURANCE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO.
Jon: SURE, THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. OH, THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF OBAMACARE BUT GO AHEAD.
WE ALSO HAVE TO ASSURE THAT WE DO OUR VERY BEST TO HELP EACH STATE IN THEIR  EFFORT TO ASSURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE.
Jon: OH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA-- OH, IT'S LIKE ITS MEDICAID EXPANSION THAT IS  IN OBAMACARE, OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.
GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PREEXISTING CONDITIONS KNOW  THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BE INSURED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP EVERYTHING BUT THE MANDATE AKA THE THING THAT  PAYS FOR ALL OF IT. SO THE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE REPUBLICAN IS SAYING DON'T WORRY, YOU ARE GOING TO GET  ALL THE GOODIES BUT NOT THE BILL. BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE TAXES. AND THAT WOULD BE TYRANNY, EXCEPT IN MASSACHUSETTS WHERE IT WORKS AND OH  [BLEEP] IT, JUST MAKE ME PRESIDENT, OKAY! I HAVE BEEN RUNNING FOR LIKE 2,000 YEARS, YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T GOING TO LAST FOREVER, PEOPLE. I GOT LIKE SIX TO EIGHT MORE YEARS OF HANDSOME. WE DO HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE OF THE LANDMARK DECISION, FIRST TO JASON JONES, STANDING BY LIVE AT  THE SUPREME COURT. JASON, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JON, I HAVE THE MAJORITY DECISION RIGHT HERE. AND APPARENTLY-- THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS IS-- UNCONSTITUTIONAL, IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL, THE  SUPREME COURT STRIKING DOWN THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, JON.
Jon: JASON, DID YOU JUST START READING THE DECISION NOW?
NO, I GOT THIS AT 10:15 THIS MORNING LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
Jon: YOU'RE STILL ON THE FIRST PAGE.
I'M NOT THE STRONGEST READER. LET'S NOT MAKE A FEDERAL CASE OUT OF IT, ALL RIGHT.
Jon: OKAY.
JON, JON, I'VE GOT A CORRECTION. WHILE OBAMA'S USE OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE TO ENACT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS  UNCONSTITUTIONAL, IT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S TAX AND  SPENDING POWERS.
Jon: YEAH.
ONLY HOLY [BLEEP] IT'S A TAX?
Jon: YEAH.
COME ON, I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR YET.
JON.
Jon: SAMANTHA BEE WHAT IS IT, SAMANTHA BEE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HARRY POTTER IS DEAD.
Jon: I'M SORRY.
HARRY POTTER IS DEAD, HE'S DEAD, GOD DAMMIT, VOLDEMORT, YOU BALD BASTARD! WAIT, HOLD ON.
Jon: WHAT HAPPENED.
HOLD ON JUST ONE SECOND, HOLD ON-- OH, I'M SORRY, NEVER MIND, NO.
Jon: THANK YOU, JASON JONES,
