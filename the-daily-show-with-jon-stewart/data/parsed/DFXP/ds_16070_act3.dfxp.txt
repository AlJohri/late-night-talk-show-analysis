YOU KNOW, SOMETHING YOU SAID EARLIER REMINDED ME OF ONE OF THE INTERVIEWS WE DID IN A BOOK  WITH SUSAN JACOBI. YOU WERE TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF KEEPING THINGS HIDDEN AND THE LANGUAGE OF DECEPTION. IT SEEMS LIKE THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE IS NOW THE LANGUAGE OF DECEPTION, AND NEWS MEDIA, WHOSE  JOB IT WOULD BE TO DEFOG THE ROOM, ARE PRETENDING THAT THEY CAN JUST NOT EVEN REFEREE BUT I  DON'T KNOW, MOD RATED WOULDN'T BE THE RIGHT WORD, NARRATE. IT SEEMS LIKE THE NEWS MEDIA TODAY JUST FAR -- NARRATES AS OPPOSED TO ANYTHING ELSE.
THEY'RE NARRATING THEIR IMPRESSION. THEY'RE NOT REPORTING ABOUT THE WORLD. SUSAN JACOBI IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING INTERVIEWS ABOUT HER BECAUSE SHE'S THE AUTHOR OF A  BOOK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO EXERCISE INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT. THEY'RE THE REBELS AND THE PROTESTERS. AND SHE TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID. IN FACT, I DON'T LIKE TO INTERVIEW... I ADMIRE WHAT POLITICIANS DORK BUT I DON'T  LIKE TO INTERVIEW THEM BECAUSE THEIR LANGUAGE IS DESIGNED TO CONCEAL. I LIKE TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE WHO WANT THE REVEAL THEIR THINKING, AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WORKS WITH YOU AS WELL. PEOPLE WANT TO TALK. THEY WILL TALK. THEY WON'T TRY TO PUT IT IN THAT SMOKE AND FOG OF DECEPTION. POLITICS, NEWT GINGRICH, BLESS HIS HEART, GOT IN TROUBLE ON  "MEET THE PRESS" BY SPEAKING THE TRUTH. YOU CAN'T SPEAK THE TRUTH ON TELEVISION TODAY BECAUSE SOMEBODY WILL FIND A WAY TO TURN  IT AGAINST YOU, AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE VERY CAUTIOUS, VERY  CAREFUL, THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO ENGAGE. WE'RE NOT EVEN HERE TALKING ABOUT THE WORDS. BOTH OF US ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE MEANING OF EACH OF US, TRYING TO GET TO THE MEANING BEHIND THE WORDS. THAT'S WHERE THE INTERVIEW BECOMES A CONVERSATION, WHEN BOTH OF YOU ARE TRYING TO BE  COMFORTABLE IN EXPLORING.
WHAT DO YOU DO IN THAT SITUATION? THIS IS'DING AWAY AT ME. WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY ON THERE THAT YOU WANT SO DESPERATELY TO ENGAGE IN THAT MANNER. WE HAD DONALD RUMSFELD ON OUR SHOW. I CAN HONESTLY SAY I BELIEVE I LOST MORE SLEEP OVER THAT INTERVIEW THAN HE PROBABLY DID  OVER THE ENTIRE IRAQ WAR. [LAUGHTER] DURING THE INTERVIEW, THOUGH, IT'S VERY EARLY ON, AND HE SAYS, I SAY TO HIM, SO THE ADMINISTRATION SELLS US THIS IDEA OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. "IF I MAY, NOT SOLD, PRESENTED." IT WAS EARLY ON. AND I JUST WENT PAST IT. AND THAT NIGHT AROUND 2:00 A.M. WHERE I DO MY BEST WORK --  [LAUGHTER] I WAS THINKING, THAT WAS THE INTERCESSORY VIEW, IN THE SPACE BETWEEN OUR DEFINITIONS OF WHAT  THEY DID, SOLD AND PRESENTED, AND HOW DO YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT? HOW DO YOU FIND THOSE SPACES AND CAN YOU AND HOW DO YOU LET IT GO?
WELL, MOST OF MY GUESTS ARE NOT ON THE SHOW TO MAKE NEWS. THEY'RE ON THE EXPLAIN THE NEWS, TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE NEWS. SO THERE'S IN GAME PLAN THERE. THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO FIND THAT EDGE THAT WILL CREATE A HEADLINE  IN TOMORROW MORNING'S PAPER. THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO HELP US PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AND EXPERIENCED. YOU KNOW, THE WORST HOUR THAT I EVER PUT ON WAS MANY YEARS AGO WITH HENRY KISSINGER. HE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE. HE GRANTED ME AN INTERVIEW. ALL HE DID [GRUMBLING] [LAUGHTER] IT WAS ELOQUENT. [GRUMBLING] I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD HE WAS SAYING. YES, MR. KISSINGER. BUT I ALREADY ANNOUNCED IT. I HAD TO PUT IT ON THE AIRMENT I VOWED AFTER THAT NEVER TO DO AN HOUR WITH ANY OFFICIAL BECAUSE  THEY'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT  THEY SAY, EVEN THOUGH THEY USE SIMPLE WORDS TO EXPRESS IT SOMETIMES. WHAT YOU DO IS, WELL, HERE'S MY TECHNIQUE, AND IN 40 YEARS, I'VE NEVER BEEN CALLED ON IT. I INTERVIEW IN LECH, AND THEN I EDIT. I MAKE SURE THAT WE IN THE EDITING GET TO THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THAT PERSON REALLY WANTED TO SAY. IT'S MATTER OF JUDGMENT, BUT IN 40 YEARS, I'VE NEVER HAD ANYBODY  COME BACK AND SAY, YOU TOOK ME OUT OF CONTEXT OR YOU DIDN'T GET TO THE ESSENCE. THEY ARE ACTUALLY THANKFUL THAT WE HAVE LISTENED IN A WAY THAT IS BEYOND THE WORDS AND THEN  EDITED WHAT IS THEIR VIEW OF WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE SAID IF THEY WERE AS GOOD AS IT AS WE  ARE IN EDITING. [LAUGHTER] YOU LISTEN FOR THE MEANING, NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE WORDS.
Jon: YOU SAID IT BEAUTIFULLY. THAT'S THE OTHER THING I SHOULD WRITE DOWN, "EDIT TO NOT TAKE OUT OF CONTEXT."  [LAUGHTER]
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BILL MOIRGS. MOYERS. HIS NEW BOOK IS ON SHELVES NOW. BILL MOYERS.
