MAY 2, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS EADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THISH  IS THE "THE "DAILY SHOW"" WITH JON STEWART  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) .
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY GUEST, THE SENATOR THERE THE GREAT STATE OF OKLAHOMA, TOM COBURN, WILL BE JOINING US LATER. HE'S WRITTEN A BOOK-- IT'S A COMEDY. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S ABOUT AMERICA AND HOW WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE. ( LAUGHTER ) BY THE WAY, WE'LL RICK OFF THE TOP, THIS AFTERNOON WE GOT A BIG  ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE ONE-TIME FRONT-RUNNER FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION.
TODAY.
I'M SUSPENDING THE CAMPAIGN.
Jon:  WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT, NOT ENDING, JUST SUSPENDING. HE'S SUSPENDING IT LIKE WE HULLA TO DO WITH OUR DISBELIEF WHEN HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TOOK PRESIDENT.
BUT SUSPENDING THE CEEM DOES NOT MEAN SUSPENDING CITIZENSHIP. CALISTA AND I ARE COMMITTED TO BEING ACTIVE CITIZENS.
Jon:  WOULDN'T IT BE AWESOME THOUGH IF IT DID MEAN SUSPENDING CITIZENSHIP? LIKE IF YOU'RE YOU LOSING A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY, YOU'RE DEPORTED. WOULDN'T THAT AWESOME? I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THOUGHT THEY WOULD LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT  IT'S GOOD TO KNOW YOU MEMBER ACTIVE CITIZENS AND HAUNT PEOPLE ON JURY DUTY. ( LAUGHTER ). LET'S MOVE MOVE ON. OUR MAIN STORY TOAPS FOCUSES ON THE MAN WHO DEFEATED NEWT GINGRICH. AS YOU KNOW, MITT ROMNEY IS MORMON. THAT'S ACTUALLY, THAT'S KIND OF UNNECESSARY-- HE'S MORMON. THERE'S NOTHING-- THERE'S NOTHING FRIGHTENING-- THERE'S  NOTHING FRIGHTENING ABOUT HIM BEING A MORMON. OKAY, YOU'VE OVER-CORRECTED. THAT WAS AN OVER-CORRECTION. I SHOULD HAVE QUALIFIED THAT STATEMENT. THERE'S NOTHING FRIGHTENING ABOUT ROMNEY BEING A MORMON TO ME. APPARENTLY, SOME IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S EVANGELICAL BASE THINK OTHERWISE.
MITT ROMNEY IS A GOOD MORAL PERSON BUT HE'S NOT A CHRISTIAN. MORMONNISM IS NOT CHRISTIANITY. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED A CULT BY THE MAIN STREET OF CHRISTIANITY.
MOST CHRISTIANS WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE MORMONNISM AS PART OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH.
WHAT THIS WOULD MEAN FOR THE SPIRITUAL HEALTH OF THE UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA IF A WORSHIPER OF A FALSE GOD OCCUPIED THE WHITE HOUSE.
Jon:  YES! YOU WOULD NEVER WANT SOMEONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO WORSHIPPED A DIFFERENT GOD THAN YOU. IF I MAY, AS A JEW-- ( LAUGHTER ) YOU GET USED TO IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT OF COURSE, THOSE COMMENT WERE MADE WHILE ROMNEY WAS STILL  DUKING IT OUT WITH REAL CHRISTIAN CANDIDATES. NOW THAT A FALSE GOD HAS TRIUMPHED, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN A CHRISTIAN LIKE BARACK OBAMA, WHO EMBRACES NON-BIBLICAL  PRINCIPLES, LIKE ABORTION, AND A MORMON LIKE MITT ROMNEY, WHO EMBRACES BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES, THERE'S EVERY REASON TO SUPPORT MITT ROMNEY IN THIS ELECTION.
Jon:  SIMPLE MATH. ( LAUGHTER ). I HATE BARACK OBAMA MORE THAN I LOVE JESUS. WHATEVER THE REASON, AT LEAST CONSERVATIVES WILL NOW FINALLY CEDE THEIR ANTI-MORMON ATTACKS  TO THE GROUP THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING ANTI-MORMON ATTACKS, GODLESS DEMOCRATS.
MONTANA'S DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR, BRIAN SWRIETSER, TOUCHED A NERVE, ASKED ABOUT GOVERNOR ROMNEY TRYING TO APPEAL TO LATINO VOTERS, SINCE HIS  FATHER WAS BORN IN MEXICOICO, IT'S IRONIC FROM A FAMILY COMING FROM A POLYGAMY.
Jon:  I'M NOT SAYING ALL MORMONS ARE MEXICAN POLYGAMISTS, I'M JUST SAYING MITT ROMNEY'S GRANDFATHER WAS ONE. I'M SAYING MITT ROMNEY IS ONE-QUARTER MEXICAN POLYGAMIST IS WHAT I'M SAYING. AFTER ALL PRESIDENT OBAMA WENT THROUGH WITH THE WHOLE MUSLIM KENYAN STUFF, IS THERE ANYTHING  YOU WANT TO WALK BACK?
IS THAT FAIR TO TALK ABOUT?
WELL, PEOPLE TOOK IT WAY OFF BASE. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ANY RELIGION, AND AS I'VE SAID BEFORE, MITT ROMNEY OR HIS  FAMILY AS I KNOW OF, DOESN'T ACCEPT POLYGAMY TODAY.
Jon:  WHY ARE POLITICIANS SO ADEPT AT THE DICKISH APOLOGY. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, THAT I KNOW OF. "I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN HIS FAMILY IS IN POLYGAMY THAT I KNOW ABOUT. WE CAN'T BE SURE. DOES ROMNEY HAVE ONE WIFE WHO DRIVES A COUPLE CADILLACS OR FOUR WIVES WHO DRIVE A HALF A  ADILLAC, EACH, I DON'T KNOW?"C A SOMEWHAT OBLIQUE ATTACK ON ROMNEY'S RELIGION.
TODAY WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON WHAT MORMONNISM SAYS ABOUT LYING  AND THE REASON IS QUITE SIMPLE-- THERE ROMNEY SEEMS TO BE HAVING SOME TROUBLE TELLING THE TRUTH. ALL LIARS AND WHO SO EVER LOVEST AND MAKEETH A LIE, AND THE WHORE MONGERRER AND SORCERER SHALL  HAVE THEIR PART IN THE LAKE WHICH BURNETH WITH FIRE AND BRIM STONE, WHICH IS THE SECOND DEATH.
Jon:  REALLY? WHORE MONGERRER AND THE SORCER? IS THAT FROM THE BOOK OF MORMON OR MSNBC'S NEW DEBATE SHOW ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  OR--
MR. ROMNEY HAS GOT TWO CHOICES. HE CAN EITHER KEEP LYING AND POTENTIALLY WIN THE WHITE HOUSE BUT BRING ETERNAL DAMNINATION  UPON HIMSELF, OR HE CAN START TELLING THE TRUTH.
Jon:  YES, THOSE ARE HIS ONLY TWO CHOICES OR HE COULD TAKE THE THIRD CHOICE, THE ONE  EVERY PRESIDENT AND POLITICIAN HAS MADE FROM THE DAWN OF TIME-- CONTINUE TO PROFESS YOUR FAITH  WHILST ALSO LYING. BEING A MORMON HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ROMNEY'S CONUNDRUM. YOU DON'T SPIT SCRIPTURE AT HIM ALTHOUGH IT TAKES A BOLD MAN TO CRITICIZE SOMEONE ABOUT A BOOK  THEY ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY ( BLEEP ). HE IS NOT SAYING IT'S A FALSE RELIGION.
A GUY IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, IN 1830, WHEN HE GOT CAUGHT HAVING  SEX WITH THE MAID AND EXPLAINED TO HIS WIFE THAT GOD TOLD HIM TO DO IT.
Jon:  MORMONS AREN'T THE ONLY RELIGION WHO'S ORIGIN STORY  CAN BE EXPLAINED AS A CONVENIENT ALIBI. YOU CAN AS EASILY SAY THE CHRISTIANITY WAS CREATED BY A KNOCKED UP TEENAGED GIRL WHO  TOLD HER PARENTS AN ANGEL HAD COME DOWN. OR MAYBE YOU COULD SAY BUSED BOOUDISM WAS CREATED BY A GUY WHO FELL ASLEEP UNDER A TREE AND  MISSED WORK AND EXPLAINED HE WAS LATE BECAUSE HE DISCOVERED ANOTHER STATE OF BEING. YEAH, WHATEVER, FAT ASS. GET BACK TO THE DEEP FRYER. STOP EEGHT THE INVENTORY. NOW, OF COURSE, IT IS FAIR TO QUESTION RELIGIOUS PRACTICES AT TIMES. MORMONS HAD A STRICT NO BLACK CLERGY ALLOWED POLICY UP UNTIL 1978. THAT COULD RAISE SOME CONCERNS. NOT THIS ONE BUT--
SO, DID MORMON MEN MITT ROMNEY'S AGE ACTUALLY BELIEVE OR EVER BELIEVE WHAT THEIR HERO  BRIGHAM YOUNG TAUGHT THEM ABOUT THE AFRICAN RACE THAT THEY WOULD DIE ON THE SPOT IF THEY HAD SEX  WITH A BLACK WOMAN? MITT ROMNEY KNOWS HE WILL NEVER HAVE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
Jon:  FIRST OF ALL, THAT WOULD BE THE GREATEST PAM GREER REVENGE MOVIE EVER, EVER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT AS A QUESTION, IT IS RIDICULOUS. ALTHOUGH, IF YOU'RE TRULY CONCERNED IF ALL MORMONS BELIEVE THAT, YOU HAD DEMOCRATIC SENATE  MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID ON, HE'S A MORMON, WHICH WHO I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR HOW HE ANSWERS IT.
DO YOU FEAR THIS FAILURE OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATES WILL, IN FACT, FOCUS REAL REPUBLICAN ENERGY ON TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR MAJORITY LEADERSHIP?
Jon:  AND AS A FOLLOW-UP, IF YOU BANG A BLACK WOMAN, WILL YOU DIE ON THE SPOT? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU CAN'T CHERRY PICK THE WORST ASPECTS OF THE A RELIGION AND  HOLD A PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. IT'S NOT RELEVANT. IT'S NOT LIKE MITT ROMNEY WILL PURSUE POLICIES THAT ARE UNFAIR  TO BLACK PEOPLE BECAUSE HE'S A MORMON. HE'LL DO THAT BECAUSE HE'S A REPUBLICAN. ( LAUGHTER )
