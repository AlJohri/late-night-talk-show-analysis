(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK. NOW, IN RECENT YEARS WE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN SURPRISED A LOT BY THINGS HAPPENING TO US. (LAUGHTER) THE BANKING CRISIS NO ONE SAW COMING DESPITE TWO 24-HOUR BUSINESS NEWS NETWORKS. TERROR ATTACKS THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED EXCEPT FROM THE THREATS. THE DISCOVERY THAT WHILE IRAQ HAD NO CONNECTION WITH THOSE ATTACKS, IT DID HAVE NOT ONE BUT  TWO TYPES OF MUSLIMS. (LAUGHTER) THE TRADITIONAL AND ZESTY. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY WE COUNT ON OUR NEWS WEEKLY MAGAZINES TO PROVIDE  CONTEXT TO THE DAY-TO-DAY NEWS CYCLE. THAT'S DIFFICULT. IT'S TOO FAST. TAKE THIS WEEK'S "TIME" MAGAZINE. IT'S GOTTEN A IN-DEPTH PIECE ON ITALY'S NEW PRIME MINISTER MARIO  MONTY AND HIS WORK TO FIX EUROPE'S ECONOMY. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STORY.

(LAUGHTER) IT'S ACTUALLY COVER STORY IN THYME'S EUROPEAN EDITION AND  THEIR ASIAN EDITION AND THEIR SOUTH PACIFIC EDITION AND, OF COURSE, RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA  IT'S...

THE U.S. ISSUE: WHY ANXIETY IS GOOD FOR YOU. APPARENTLY, ANXIETY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU THAT YOU'D WANT TO READ ABOUT ANGRY ARABS. (LAUGHTER) OR AUGUST, 2011, THE INTERNATIONAL EDITIONS GO WITH TRAVELS THROUGH ISLAM. A CHANCE TO EXPAND OUR KNOWLEDGE OF WORLD CULTURE. SAME WEEK IN THE UNITED STATES, "CHORE WARS." BECAUSE MY GRASP OF ISLAM CAN WAIT UNTIL I KNOW WHY EMPTYING  THE DIAPER PAIL IS SUDDENLY MY (BLEEP)ING JOB. (LAUGHTER) TOUGH TIME TIMES. REMEMBER THIS, "TIME" MAGAZINE? WE WERE YOUR PEOPLE OF THE YEAR! WE THOUGHT THAT YOU THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL! YOU MADE US YOUR... I KNOW WHY YOU DID IT. YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD SELL MORE COPIES IF YOU PUT SOMETHING SHINY ON THE COVER. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHS) OH, I HAVE A PUNCHING BAG IF MY MOUTH. WELL, THANK GOD OTHER PUBLICATIONS ARE PICKING UP THE HARD NEWS SLACK, LIKE THE REPORT  ON THE GREEK AUSTERITY RISE AND THE CURRENT CAT FANCY AND, OF COURSE, THE FIRST EVER "SPORTS  ILLUSTRATED" SWIMSUIT ISSUE TO BE SHOT IN WAR-TORN SYRIA.
