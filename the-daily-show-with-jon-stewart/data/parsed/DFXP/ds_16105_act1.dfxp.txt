FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE SHOW. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, WE HAVE A PROFESSOR, PROFESSOR JOHN COFFEE FROM COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL WILL BE HERE. HE'S GOING TO HELP US UNDERSTAND THE CREDIT RATING SYSTEM. BUT FIRST, ALWAYS, A WORD OF ADVICE TO THE LADIES OUT THERE. LADY, IF YOU'RE IN A BAR TONIGHT... [LAUGHTER] AND A GENTLEMAN COMES UP TO YOU AND LEANS IN VERY SMOOTHLY AND HE SAYS, "MY BROTHER HAS AN  IPAD," DON'T GO OUT WITH HIM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] DON'T GO OUT WITH HIM. YEAH. DON'T GO OUT WITH HIM BECAUSE THAT WILL BE A LONG NIGHT OF  STARING AT "STAR WARS" FIGURES THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN TAKEN OUT  OF THE BOX TO BE PLAYED WITH. YOU DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT. HEY, REMEMBER... THE KIDS LOVE IT. NOTHING THE TELEVISION AUDIENCE LOVES MORE THAN AN INSIDE JOKE THAT THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE  [BLEEPED] HAPPENED. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? SO YOU REMEMBER THE 2010 MID-TERM ELECTIONS WHEN AMERICA WAS ROCKED BY A TEA-SOAKED  POPULIST UPRISING, JUST SOME REGULAR JOE EARL GRAYS AND JANE ORANGE ZINGERS IN MIDDLE AMERICA  TAKING BACK THEIR COUNTRY FROM THE OUT-OF-TOUCH ELITES.
WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK.
CROWD: OBAMA MUST GO!
♪ HEY, HEY, HEY GOOD-BYE ♪♪
WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK, AND WE WANT IT BACK NOW! [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M SORRY. THIS IS YOUR COUNTRY? I'M SORRY. THERE'S A TERRIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING. WE WERE TOLD IT WAS A TIMESHARE. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, THESE VERY ANGRY COUNTRY OWNERS SWEPT BACK INTO POWER, RETURNING MANY STATE HOUSES AND LEGISLATURES TO REPUBLICAN CONTROL, INCLUDING WISCONSIN, WHERE NEW GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER FLUSH WITH VICTORY AND A LEGISLATIVE SUPER MAJORITY  PRECEDED TO LET WISCONSIN PUBLIC UNIONS KNOW THEIR SERVICES WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY. NOW, THAT THE STATE HAD BEEN RETURNED TO ITS RIGHT-WING... I'M SORRY, RIGHTFUL OWNERS. BUT AS IT TURNS OUT, THIS NEW STANCE DID NOT SIT WELL WITH WISCONSIN'S PREVIOUS OWNERS, THE  DEMOCRATS, A FEW OF WHOM HAD YET TO MOVE TO ILLINOIS.
WE'RE TAKING BACK THE SUPREME COURT. ♪ HEY, HEY HO, HO ♪ YOU HAVE TO GO ♪♪ ♪ HEY, HEY, HEY  GOOD-BYE ♪♪
Jon: NOW I'M CONFUSED. LAUGHTER LAUGH YOU'RE THE PEOPLE? I THOUGHT THEY WERE THE PEOPLE. YOU CAN'T BOTH BE THE PEOPLE, UNLESS WE GOT OURSELVES AN OLD-FASHIONED WISCONSIN POPULIST-OFF. LET'S BLOW UP SOME COWS. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] DO YOU KNOW HOW UPSETTING IT IS FOR A COW TO BE DETONATEED, RECONSTITUTED AND THEN LIT ON FIRE? THAT IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR WHEN IT COMES TO TREATING LIVESTOCK. WELL, LAST NIGHT WITH TENSIONS HIGH, THE WISCONSIN POPULISM OFF CAME TO A HEAD WHEN DEMOCRATS  UNHAPPY WITH THE RESULTS OF THE 2010 MID-TERM ELECTION'S POPULIST MOVEMENT. FORCED A SPECIAL POPULIST 2011 ELECTION TO RECALL SIX REPUBLICAN STATE SENATORS, HOPING TO WIN AT LEAST THREE OF THOSE RACES TO REGAIN AT LEAST ONE-VOTE MAJORITY CONTROL OF THE  UPPER HOUSE OF THE WISCONSIN STATE LEGISLATURE. OR TO PUT THAT IN LESS HYPERBOLIC TERMS.
THIS IS GROUND ZERO FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. THIS IS GROUND ZERO FOR ORGANIZED LABOR.
MAJOR MOMENT FOR THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT.
A TOTALLY HISTORICALLY UNPRECEDENTED NATURE OF THIS ELECTION.
NATIONAL POLITICAL HISTORY.
NATIONAL DRIVE TO PUSH BACK ON WHETHER WE HAVE MORE TO GO TO BUILD A MOVE. OF RESISTANCE, BUT RESIST WE MUST. WE MUST AND WE WILL MUST ABOUT THAT BE COMMITTED. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT WAS EITHER A SCREWUP OR SOME PROFOUND YODA  [BLEEPED] YES, DO IT WE MUST, YES. RESIST WE MUST. YOU KNOW, REVEREND SHARPTON, WHEN YOU'RE AT A DRAMATIC CALL TO ACTION, THAT IS AN UNFORTUNATE TIME TO GET CAUGHT  UP IN YOUR TELEPROMPTER. YOU WERE JUST GETTING PEOPLE... I HAVE BEEN TO THE MUFFIN TOP. [LAUGHTER] I HAVE SEEN THE PROMISE GLAND. TO THE RECALL ELECTIONS THEMSELVES. IT WAS CLEAR EARLY TUESDAY NIGHT THAT REPUBLICANS HAD RETAINED THREE SEATS AND DEMOCRATS HAD  PICKED UP TWO, AND THUS ALL EYES FOCUSED ON THE TOO CLOSE TO CALL WISCONSIN SENATE DISTRICT 8. COULD WHITEFISH BAY DEMOCRAT SANDY PASCH DEFEAT ALBERTA DARLING? THE HISTORIC GROUND ZERO FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN'S CHILDREN, THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TYRANNY AND SALVATION WOULD COME DOWN TO WHETHER THE NICE LADY WHO LOOKS  LIKE KATIE COURIC COULD BEAT THE NICE LADY WHO LOOK LIKE BONNIE HUNT. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING... [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE FROM THE MIDWEST, NO MATTER THEIR POLITICAL STRIPE, NEVER LOOK LIKE [BLEEPED]. THEY JUST LOOK LIKE NICE PEOPLE. I KNOW THERE MUST BE [BLEEPED] OUT THERE. THEY JUST NEVER LOOK LIKE THEM. THAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE WITH US IN NEW YORK. WE'RE VERY NICE, BUT WE JUST ALL LOOK LIKE [BLEEPED]. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ANYWAY, BACK TO THE FATE OF FREE PEOPLES EVERYWHERE.
AND THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, ALBERTA DARLING, HAS BEEN DECLARED THE WINNER BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS WITH SIX  CONTESTS AT STAKE, THE DEMOCRATS NEEDED TO TAKE AT LEAST THREE OF THOSE RACES TO TAKE CONTROL OF  THE WISCONSIN STATE SENATE, WHICH THEY HAVE NOW FAILED TO DO.
Jon: WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT. AT I DON'T HAVE A WATCH EASTERN TIME, IT APPEARS THAT THE FIGHT  FOR THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE, THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SOUNDLY DEFEATED BY OTHER PEOPLE. BOY, YOU GOT TO FEEL BAD FOR THE PEOPLE. LOOK, EVERYONE FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT. IT WAS A REAL DEMOCRACY. LET'S PACK IT UP AND EVERYONE WILL BE CIVIL AND REGROUP FOR 2012.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, TWO MORE RECALLS IN THE STATE, TWO DEMOCRATS ARE ON THE HOT SEAT.
NEXT WEEK TWO DEMOCRATS FACE A RECALL.
Jon: WISCONSIN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
