(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YESTERDAY YESTERDAY SAME SEX MARRIAGE FINALLY BECAME LEGAL IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: APPARENTLY OUR AUDIENCE IS ON THEIR HONEYMOON. OUR LEGALLY MARRIED CORRESPONDENT SAMANTHA BEE WAS THERE TO REPORT.
NEW YORK STREETS WERE FILLED WITH JOY AND LOVE AS GAY MARRIAGE BECAME THE LAW OF THE LAND.
NOT EVEN LONG LINES WITH 100 DEGREE WEATHER OR CREATURES THAT CRAWLED OUT  OF THE DEVIL SYPHALLITC AN UNS COULD RUIN THIS.
AS A COUPLE HAPPILY MARRIED FOR YEARS WE WENT TO HEAR THE NEWLY-WED TALES OF LOVE.
THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF THEIR LIFE.
IT SERIOUSLY IS THE BEST DAY BECAUSE AFTER THIS --
WHAT DOES TODAY MEAN TO YOU GUYS.
IT MEANS FREEDOM. FREEDOM FROM ALL THE-- YOU KNOW, BACK TALKING, CRAZINESS THAT HAPPENS, VALIDATION OF OUR LOVE, OUR COMMITMENT TO EACH OTHER.
IF YOU CAN GET THAT IN A SHORTER SOUND BITE.
MAKE SURE YOU TELL THEM-- MAKE SURE YOU PUSH THEM AROUND AND TELL THEM WHAT TO SAY.
MAKE SURE-- NO, NO, PLEASE, FEEL FREE.
EXECUTIVE PRODUCE WHAT IS GOING ON IN EVERY BRAIN.
I KNOW THE CONCEPT OF HAVING YOUR BALLS IN A VICE SOUNDS LIKE FUN, BUT WHEN  IT'S MET FOR CALL, IT'S NOT FUN.
OKAY, YES, I KNOW, JAMES SO, HARD TO BE MARRIED TO ME.
WELL, MARRIED COUPLES HERE. LET'S JUST THINK OF WORDS THAT WE ASSOCIATE WITH MARRIAGE.
TOGETHER.
FOREVER.
MONOGAMY.
MONOTONY.
LOVE. (LAUGHTER)
OH MY GOSH! LOVE.
WELL, IT MEANS A LOT FOR US BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR FIVE YEARS AND  WE REALLY WANTED TO BE HERE ON THE FIRST DAY.
PIECE GET YOUR MICROPHONE-- I'M TAKING THE LEAD IN THIS.
DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH --
I'M TRYING TO WORK ON A PIECE, OKAY.
I REALIZE YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK ON A PIECE BUT I'M TRYING TO ALSO RAISE A  FAMILY AT THE SAME TIME AND WE NEED MILK AND BANANAS.
WHEN I PARRIED JASON.
I WAS NUTS ABOUT MY WIFE WHEN I MARRIED HER. I MARRIED A THOUGHTFUL, CARING, TRULY WONDERFUL HUMAN BEING.
WE USED TO GO PLACES. WE USE TO GO OUT TO DINNER. AND EYE MEAN GOD, NOW, NOW LOOK AT HIM. LOOK AT HIM OVER THERE EATING A HOT DOG. EATS LIKE A [BLEEP] SEE GULL.
NOW LOOK AT HER. JOKE MONKEY. OH, LOOK AT ME, I'M JASON JONES. I-- MY UNDERPANTS AND MY GENITALS.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MY GENITALS.
OKAY, WELL MAYBE IF SOMEONE PAID A LITTLE ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING  ON DOWN BELOW SOMEONE WOULD GO DOWN THERE A LITTLE MORE OFTEN OKAY, IT'S LIKE THE  SLUMS OF CALCUTTA DOWN THERE. (LAUGHTER)
IT HAD TAKEN A LONG TIME TO GET TO THIS MOMENT SO WHAT BETTER WAY TO  COMMEMORATE THESE SACRED UNION THAN WITH A SPECIAL VOW. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT.
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT.
THE INOBSERVATION AREABLE INERTIA OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.
THE INDEX ORABLE INERTIA IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.
IT WOULD BE HARDER TO BREAK IT OFF THAN TO CONTINUE AS WE HAVE FOR ALL  THESE YEARS SO I GUESS WE SHOULD GET MARRIED.
I GUESS WE SHOULD GET MARRIED. AMEN.
AMEN.
WHAT LA LIEU LA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
