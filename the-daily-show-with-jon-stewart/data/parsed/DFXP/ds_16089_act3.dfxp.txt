Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT PROFESSOR AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, HIS NEW BOOK  WHICH HE COAUTHORED IS CALLED "GUARANTEED TO FAIL FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC AND THE DEBACLE OF MORTGAGE FINANCE." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  MATTHEW RICHARDSON. SIR --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
FEELS GOOD TO BE HERE.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED GUARANTEED TO FAIL. IT FEELS LIKE THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ATTENTION AS FAR AS OUR ENTIRE  MORTGAGE DEBACLE AND CRASHING OF THE ECHMM. [LAUGHTER] WHAT IS YOUR FEELING -- ARE THEY PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS COLLAPSE? PARTIALLY?
YES. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE TREMENDOUS OUTRAGE AT THE MORTGAGE FINANCE SYSTEM. FANNIE AND FREDDIE WERE SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS. YOU TOOK THE TWO FIRMS WITH PUBLIC GOVERNMENT BACKING. THEY WENT FROM JUST A LITTLE BITTY PLAYERS IN THE EARLY 1980'S TO AT THE TIME OF THE  CRISIS THEY OWNED 50% OF MORTGAGE MARKET, $5 TRILLION OF MORTGAGE DEBT AT RISK WITH  LITTLE CAPITAL UNDERNEATH IT AND WE'RE PAYING FOR IT. YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT. I'M PAYING FOR IT. THE AUDIENCE IS PAYING FOR IT.
Jon: THE IDEA IS THAT THE TRICK THEY WERE PULLING WAS THEY  GO TO CONGRESS AND SAY, DON'T WORRY YOU'RE NOT ON THE HOOK FOR THIS. AND THEY WOULD GO TO WALL STREET AND SAY DON'T WORRY CONGRESS WILL PAY IF THIS GOES SOUTH.
THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT. THEY WERE A PRIVATE FIRM. THEY MAKE THE PROFITS BUT THE REST WAS BORNE BY THE TAXPAYER, AGAIN, ALL OF US, YOU COMBINE THOSE TOGETHER IT'S A NASTY MIX.
Jon: HOW DO THEY PRIVATIZE PROFIT. I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW PROFIT GETS PRIVATIZED AND LOSSES GET SOCIALIZED. HOW DOES THAT SEEM TO WORK?
THEY'RE GUARANTEED TO FAIL. THEY HAVE NO CAPITAL UNDERNEATH THEM. THEY CONTROL A HUGE AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE MARKET. IF THINGS GO WELL WHICH THEY DID FOR TEN YEARS, THEY ARE RATING THE MONEY --
Jon: WHO ARE THE SHAREHOLDERS IS THAT US?
THE PEOPLE THAT BOUGHT STOCK IN FANNIE AND FREDDIE. IF YOU BOUGHT THAT STOCK --
Jon: YOU HAVE TO OWN THEIR STOCK?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: WHY WERE THEY ALLOWED TO -- I UNDERSTAND IT IS IN MANY RESPECTS A NOBLE ENDEAVOR TO  HELP PEOPLE OWN THEIRijIS IT NOT? ISN'T THERE VALUE TO THAT?
WE SUBSIDIZED HOUSING SOX WE GOT PEOPLE TO BORROW MORE THAN  THEY COULD AFFORD TO BUY HOUSES BIGGER THAN THEY TPHAOEFPLD IT'S  GREAT WHEN EVERYTHING IS GOING UP AND WHEN THE PYRAMID BEGINS TO COLLAPSE YOU FEEL THE PAIN.
Jon: WOULD WE HAVE FELT THE SAME PAIN. WHY WAS FANNIE AND FREDDY ALLOWED TO BUY INTO THE DERIVE ACTIVES MARKET. WHY DID THEY GET INTO THAT BUSINESS?
THEY WERE SIMPLE INSTITUTIONS THEY BOUGHT SIMPLE MORTGAGE BACKED SUPREME COURTS AND  GUARANTEE THE DEFAULT RISK ON MORTGAGES. YOUR POINT ABOUT THE MORTGAGE SECURITIES MARKET IS WELL TAKEN. WE DESCRIBE IT AS A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC WE CALL IT GODZILLA. YOU HAVE THE BANKS WE CALL KING CONGRESS. WE WANT THE READER TO ENVISION THEY ARE LOOKING AT DOWNTOWN TOKYO LOOK THE AT GODZILLA AND  KING KONG BATTLING IT OUT. YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH BOTH AND THE LARGE INSTITUTIONS.
Jon: WHEN GODZILLA AND KING KONG ARE ATTACKED IN TOKYO IS THERE A REGULATORY ALIVE THAT  COULD ZAP THEM WITH A GAMMA RAY? OR HOW DO YOU BATTLE THAT TYPE OF -- IT STRIKES ME AS, IF WE'RE BACKING THEM AND BACKING THE  PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURERS WHO ARE WE NOT BECOMING AND HOW COULD WE AS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC  HAVE WON IN THE FIRST PLACE.
ONCE YOU MADE THEM KINGï¿½ï¿½ KONG AND GODZILLA THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. YOU HAVE TO PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING THAT.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE FAITH THERE CAN BE AN AGGRESSIVE STREAMLINE, NOT CUMBERSOME  BUREAUCRACY, REGULATORY REGIME THAT COULD CONTROL THESE THINGS OR IS IT POLITCALLY NOT FEASIBLE?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE POLITICS. IN THE BOOK WE HAVE A THREE-STAGE PLAN TO GET FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW TO WHERE WE WANT TO BE. FIRST WE STOP MESSING AROUND AND WIND DOWN FANNY AND FREDDIE. SECOND WE NEED TO WEAN MORTGAGE FINANCE OFF THE GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN'T DO IT COLD TURKEY. YOU HAVE TO DO IT GRADUALLY. OUR PLAN TAKES A DECADE TO DO THAT.
Jon: WE'LL BE HERE THEN. IF THEY FIGHT FOR A DECADE THAT SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT. WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE! [LAUGHTER]
IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING. YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS IT AT SOME POINT. YOU WOULD HOPE A PRIVATE MORTGAGE FINANCE SYSTEM WELL FUNCTIONING. YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT WELL REGULATED AND IF YOU HAVE THAT YOU HAVE A MUCH BETTER  FUNCTIONING ECONOMY AFTERWARDS.
Jon: ONE WORD YES OR NO IS THAT -- THERE ANY POSSIBILITY IN THIS UNIVERSE THAT THAT GETS DONE?
50/50.
Jon: "GUARANTEED TO FAIL" IT'S REALLY DISTURBING. GET IT.
