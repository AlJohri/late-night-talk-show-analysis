I DID.
Jon: HOW UPSET WERE YOU WHEN THE INITIALS BULLPEN TURNED INTO WHAT THEY TURNED... B.P..
WELL, I FEEL LIKE THEY TOOK OFF ON MY NAME. AND IT DIDN'T HELP.
Jon: NO, I DID NOT. THEY, IN FACT, STOLE IT. LET ME ASK YOU THIS, SO YOU WERE ON TWO YEARS AGO, AND AT THE TIME YOU WERE DISCUSSING HOW IN  TEN YEARS YOU FELT LIKE WE WOULD BE OFF OF FOREIGN OIL.
NO. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IN 20 YEARS YOU FELT... IN 50 YEARS...
NO.
Jon: 30 YEARS? (LAUGHTER) WHAT WAS THE TIME FRAME THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT TO GET US OFF?
WHAT I WANTED TO GET US OFF OF WAS OPEC OIL.
Jon: OPEC OIL.
RIGHT. SEE, WE IMPORT 13 MILLION BARRELS A DAY.
Jon: OF OPEC OIL?
NO, FIVE OF IT COMES FROM OPEC.
Jon: THAT'S WHO YOU WANT TO ELIMINATE. TEN YEARS.
YEAH, WE CAN DO IT. WE CANNOT THEM OUT IN TEN YEARS.
Jon: WELL, THIS WAS TWO YEARS AGO THAT YOU HAD SAID THIS.
YES.
Jon: HOW MUCH CLOSER TO OUR GOAL NOW... WE ARE 20% IN. HAVE WE KNOCKED OFF 20% OF OPEC?
NO. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO WOULD YOU SAY, SIR, WE'RE BEHIND? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, WE'RE TEN YEARS... IT'S STILL TEN YEARS.
Jon: IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ALL AT ONCE. WE'LL DO NOTHING AND THEN IN TEN YEARS... (LAUGHTER) BOOM?
NO, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK, EITHER.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
NO, YOU'VE GOT TO GET STARTED. WE'VE GOT TO GET STARTED. BUT IF YOU REMEMBER, THE PRESIDENT TOLD US WHEN HE GOT THE NOMINATION, HE SAID NOW THIS  IS JULY OF '08 8. HE SAID IN TEN YEARS WE WILL NOT IMPORT ANY OIL FROM THE MIDDLE EAST. I LOVED IT. IT'S A GREAT STATEMENT.
Jon: NOW, YOU KNOW... BOY, I HATE TO DO THIS. I FEEL LIKE I'M TELLING YOU SANTA'S NOT REAL. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME OTHER PRESIDENTS IN YOUR LIFETIME WHO MAY HAVE MADE A  SIMILAR STATEMENT GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO, LET'S SAY, GROVER CLEVELAND. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE HEARD AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN  FROM THE TIME OF NIXON.
I USE YOUR DEAL ON MY WEB SITE.
Jon: OH, THE LITTLE... THE COMPILATION OF ALL THE PRESIDENTS SAYING THAT?
YEAH.
Jon: WHY DO YOU BELIEVE IT NOW WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE IT NOW?
IT'S GOT TO BE DONE FOR THE COUNTRY. ABSOLUTELY. WE'VE GONE 40 YEARS WITH NOW ENERGY PLAN. DO YOU KNOW WHO ELSE DOESN'T HAVE AN ENERGY PLAN IN THE WORLD
Jon: LICK TEN AND SEEN TBeï¿½
NOBODY!
Jon: NOBODY?
NOBODY, WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WITHOUT AN ENERGY PLAN.
Jon: IS ANYONE ELSE TAKING THIS STEP TO NATURAL SGHAS ARE THERE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE  MADE ADVANCES THAT WE HAVE NOT?
YEAH. THERE ARE OTHERS HAVE THAT HAVE TAKEN THE PICKENS PLAN. CHINA.
Jon: THE PICKENS PLAN?
YEAH.
Jon: (LAUGHS)
THEY HAVE. IT WAS IN THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."
Jon: I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THAT IS CATCHY. CHINA HAS...
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" HAD THE OTHER DAY THAT CHINA HAS  ACCEPTED THE PICKENS PLAN.
Jon: WHAT IS THE PICKENS PLAN AND WHY DID CHINA GET IT AND DID YOU OFFER IT TO US FIRST? (LAUGHTER)
I DID, OF COURSE.
Jon: WELL, WHAT DID WE SAY?
WE... WE'RE WORKING ON IT. SON OF A GUN!
RIGHT. SON OF A BITCH. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DID YOU TELL THEM CHINA WAS TAKING IT?
I DID. BUT... (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE... THIS... I MEAN THE CHINESE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES.
Jon: WHO ELSE?
TODAY... YESTERDAY ABU DHABI SAID THEY'RE GOING TO USE NATURAL GAS FOR TRANSPORTATION  FUEL AND GUESS WHAT?
Jon: WHAT?
WELL, THEY'LL SELL THE OIL TO US. (LAUGHTER) THEY'RE GOING TO USE NATURAL GAS. WELL, IT'S ALL OVER. IRANIANS HAVE ALSO DONE THE SAME THING. THEY'RE GONE TO NATURAL GAS FOR TRANSPORTATION.
Jon: OH, THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S REALLY GOOD. I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR THEM. THAT'S EXCITING. (LAUGHTER) GIVE THEM MORE TIME TO WORK ON THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM. THAT'S EXCITING. WHAT IS IT... IF THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE-- AND WE ARE CONDITIONED TO BE SOMEWHAT... IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GET BROKEN UP AND YOUR HEART GETS SCARRED. WE ARE CONDITIONED TO BE CAUTIOUS. IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE SO IT MUST BE. IS IT HORRIBLY ON FAITH. IS THAT WHAT IT IS? IS IT THAT WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT POISONING THE COUNTRY? WHAT IS IT THAT'S KEEPING US FROM DOING IT?
FRACKING STARTED IN 1953 AND I DO NOT ONE WELL... THEY ALWAYS  USED TO SAY IT CONTAMINATE IT IS AQUIFER. I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN. AND YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT BEING THE FIRST READER. I'VE BEEN HERE. I HAVE FRANKED 3,000 WELLS IN MY LIFE. (LAUGHTER)
YOU'RE LIKE THAT WILT CHAMBERLAIN OF TRACKING. (LAUGHTER)
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING DAMAGED.
Jon: I'M SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD SAY "I HAVE. IT'S BEEN ON MY LAND." IS THERE A WAY TO DO IT AND STILL PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE  LAND AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON TOP OF THESE HUGE RESERVES?
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND WELLS FRACKED. YES, SURE THERE IS. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
Jon: WE CAN DO IT.
OH....
Jon: YOU FEEL CONFIDENT?
I FEEL... I KNOW.
Jon: TEN YEARS.
EIGHT YEARS?
OH, WE COULD....
Jon: 30 YEARS?
WE COULD DO... WE CAN... THE FIRST PLACE WE HAVE TO START... I MEAN, OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AMERICA TO DO. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE AN ENERGY PLAN. ENERGY PLAN MEANS YOU'VE GOT TO GET ON YOUR OWN RESOURCES.
Jon: HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING DO. I'M GOING GO TO COMMERCIAL BREAK. DO YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO EXPLAIN THE ENERGY PLAN WILL BE AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO  IMPLEMENT IT?
I'LL STAY AN HOUR. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WE HAVE FIVE MORE MINUTES. (LAUGHTER) T. BOONE PICKENS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
