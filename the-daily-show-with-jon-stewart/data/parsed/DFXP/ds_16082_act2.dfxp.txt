Jon: WELCOME BACK TO OUR PROGRAM. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU QUICKLY ABOUT SOMETHING, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT COMPUTERS. WE USE THEM FOR EVERYTHING, FOR MASTERBATING TO SHOPPING TO SHOPSTERBAT,. BUT FOR ALL THE COMPUTER'S CONVENIENCE, THERE'S ALSO A DARK SIDE.
THE CIA'S WEB SITE HAS BEEN HACKED BY THE SAME GROUP THAT ALSO CLAIMED  ATTACKS ON SONY AND PBS.
THE IMF SAYS THEY DEFINITELY WERE HACKED.
BREAK APPROXIMATING INTO CITIGROUP'S WEB SITE.
THEY HAVE HACKED SONY AND NOW THE U.S. SENATE.
GOOGLE RSA AND LOCKHEED MARTIN.
RECEIVED TWEETS FROM KIM CAR BASHIAN, YOU SHOULD KNOW WAS NOT HER, HER TWITTER  ACCOUNT WAS HACKED.
Jon: WHEN WILL THE MADNESS END. FOR MORE ON WHAT WE CAN DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THE HACKER THREAT WE ARE  JOINED BY JOHN HODGMAN AND HIS SEGMENT --
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JOHN HODGMAN JOINING US. JOHN, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY WE HEAR ABOUT ANOTHER SECURITY BREACH CARRIED OUT BY HACKERS. THE CIA AND CITIBANK CAN'T STOP T HOW CAN THE REST OF US HOPE TO PROTECT OURSELVES.
HACKERS ARE LIKE SNOW FLAKES. NO TWO ARE ALIKE AND THEY WANT TO DESTROY YOU. SO THE FIRST STEP IS TO IDENTIFY WHAT TYPE OF HACKER ARE YOU DEALING WITH. KNOW YOUR ENEMY.
Jon: HOW CAN WE KNOW THEM.
YOU CAN'T KNOW THEM.
Jon: OH.
THEY'RE ANONYMOUS THAT IS THEIR NAME A NONMUSS. ANOTHER BIG GROUP IS LULZ SECURITY. THE HACKTIVIKTS BELIEVES ALL INFORMATION SHOULD BE FREE AND NOTHING STRIKES FEAR  INTO HEARTS LIKE AN EDWARDIAN OENOPHILE DANDY.
Jon: YOU DON'T LOVE THE LOGO.
I LOVE IT. PLEASE DON'T HACK ME. YOU SEEM AFRAID.
THEY ARE VERY TOUCHY AND THEY ATTACK WHEN THEY ARE MAD WHICH BRINGS THE FIRST  SOLUTION, FLATTERY. CHECK OUT THE HACKERS AT ALL TIME. DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP THEM HAPPY. IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPED MY ETSY STOREFRONT SAFE FROM BEING HACKED.
Jon: YOU HAVE AN ETSY STOREFRONT.
SURE.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU SELL.
STEAMPUNK CYLONS, OF COURSE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S THE ULTIMATE INTERNET PRODUCT. ONLY $60 BUT OF COURSE, FREE FOR HACKERS.
Jon: I DON'T THINK ALL HACKERS ARE DRIVEN BY IDEOLOGY. SOME ARE JUST THIEVES.
EXACTLY. WHILE TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM IDEAOLOGICAL HACKERS I ADVISE YOU TO BACK UP YOUR  PERSONAL INFORMATION TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM CYBURGLARS, I SUGGEST YOU BACK UP YOUR MONEY.
Jon: HOW DO YOU BACK UP YOUR MONEY.
BACK UP YOUR MONEY. BEFORE YOU SEND YOUR HARD EARNED CASH TO SOME EASILY HACKABLE ELECTROBANK, ARE  YOU GOING TO WANT TO MAKE A HARD COPY. NOW LOOK, I HAVE THESE BACKUP DOLLARS THAT I MADE AT KINKOS. THIS IS ALL MY MONEY SAFE AND SOUND, RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME.
Jon: THIS IS JUST COUNTERFEIT NONE, THESE ARE COPIES OF MY OWN DOLLAR  BILLS THAT I USE TO BUY GOODS AND SERVICES. HERE, HAVE A ROLL OF QUARTERS, JON. YOU'LL HAVE TO CUT THEM OUT BEFORE YOU SEND THEM.
VERY GENEROUS NOW. YOUR FIREWALL OF SARCASM AND DISTAKEN TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE CYBERSPIES. HACKERS WORKING FOR PORN GOVERNMENT.
BUT IF CHINA DECIDED TO ATTACK THE PENTAGON SERVICE THERE IS NOTHING AN INDIVIDUAL CAN DO.
NOT IF THAT INDIVIDUAL IS YOU, JON. BUT ELITE USERS LIKE ME CAN GO INTO THE SYSTEM, JACK INTO THE GRID. AND TAKE ON THESE HACKERS ON THEIR OWN TURF. PLEASE WATCH MY PAPER MONEY, JON, I'M GOING TO ZIP LINE INTO THE INFO CLOUD.
LAUNCHING A BRUTE FORCE ATTACK ON PENTAGON.GOV.
ALREADY ON THE COMPUTER. CONTROL ALT DELETE. (LAUGHTER) I'M BACK.
Jon: THAT WAS EXCITING. WAS THAT A FRISBEE TAPED TO YOUR CHEST.
NO, THAT WAS AN IDENTITY DISK THAT I MADE FROM A FRISBEE. AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE THE NITED STEAMPUNK VERSION YOU CAN BUY IT ON MY ETSY SITE.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JOHN HODGMAN, EVERYBODY.
