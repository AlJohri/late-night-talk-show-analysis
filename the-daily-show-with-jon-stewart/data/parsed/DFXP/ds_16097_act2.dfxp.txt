LADY BIG MAC ON TWITTER. FIVE GUYS BURGERS AND FRIES.
Jon: WHAT? FIVE GUYS IS LADY BIG MAC? ISN'T THAT LIKE THE QUAKER OATS DOING AN AD CAMPAIGN FOR FARINA? FINE. THEY GOT 24 HOURS TO FILL. THEY'RE JUST HAVING FUN. AT LEAST THE LEVEL OF TWITTER QUESTIONS IS AT THE PREFERRED CHOICE IN CHOPPED MEAT SANDWICH  CHAIN LEVEL.

Jon: AGAIN WITH LADY BIG MAC. THOSE ARE NOT BURGER-BASED ISSUES. IT'S TOUGH TO CARE ABOUT HER OPINION WHEN ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS  IN A LADY BIG MAC. TWO ALL-BEEF PATTY, SPECIAL SAUCE, LETTUCE, CHEESE, PICKED ONIONS ON A SESAME SEED VAGINA. TRUTH IS THERE ARE 45 MILLION PEOPLE ON TWITTER, AND I'M ONLY ISOLATING ONE NETWORK GETTING  FEEDBACK FROM LADY BIG MAC. I'M SURE THERE'S MORE PEOPLE OUT THERE.
